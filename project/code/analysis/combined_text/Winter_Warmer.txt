not
really
but
very
carbonated
a
solid
winter
warmer
i
dont
think
this
actually
contains
spices
if
it
does
they
are
wielded
with
a
restrained
and
tasteful
hand
plenty
of
genuine

malty
20142015
vintage
malty
and
british
o
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
sam
smith
but
overall
a
great
seasonal
beer
that
is
downright
sessionable
and
a
must
try
i
could
definitely
sit
in
a
pub
and
throw
back
a
few
of
these
before
realizing
how
much
id
had
good
blend
of
flavors
and
an
absolutely
exquisite
looking
beer
it
isnt
outstanding
in
anyway
outside
of
the
look
but
overall
it
is
a
very
solid
addition
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
samuel
smiths
yet
even
with
a
beer
such
as
this
that
isnt
as
enjoyable
as
others
its
still
damn
good
poured
a
clear

a

overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
rich
sweet
winter
ale
in
the
english
tradition
malty
spicy
slightly
fruity
and
quite
pleasant
flavor
begins
malty
and
iightly
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
light
levels
of

spices
balanced
by
the
slight
bitterness
of
earthy
and
herbal
fuggle
and
golding
hops
middle
picks
up

is
lightly

with
the

continuing
alongside
light
notes
of

bready

with
a
slight
mustiness
like
a
good
traditional
english
old
ale
aftertaste
is
bready
rich
malt
and
nice
english
hop
bitterness
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
wonderfully
balanced
ale
striking
nicely
between
malta
and
hops
with
malt
dominating
but
hops
always
present
and
keeping
the
beer
from
being
overly
sweet
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
the
slightly
chalky
feel
that
many
of
samuel
smiths
ales
have
from
the
yorkshire
water
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
very
nice
drinkable
winter
ale
not
too
thick
nor
too
thin
perfectly
balanced
overall
this
is
n
excellent
winter
warmer
easily
the
best
i
have
sampled
it
has
a
wonderfully
malty
aroma
and
an
amazingly
balanced
flavor
aided
by
a
traditionally
english
mouthfeel
a
good
example
of
an
english
winter
ale
and
well
worth
drinking
overall
i
say
this
was
an
okay
winter
warmer
nothing
special
maybe
could
come
back
got
a
bottle
only
because
it
was
on
sale
at
about
2
50
has
a
beautiful
reddish
amber
color
and
smelled
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
another
story
i
get
a
malty
sour
apple
juice
with
an
awful
aftertaste
never
tasted
anything
like
it
and
probably
wont
buy
again
love
sams
organic
chocolate
stout
and
oatmeal
stout
but
now
i
see
why
it
was
marked
down
if
you
like
sour
notes
then
have
at
it
but
otherwise
you
probably
wont
enjoy
it
1
year
old
i
like
others
of
this
style
better
overall
never
having
had
this
beer
before
i
decided
to
try
it
i
have
to
say
its
a
bit
different
than
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
winter
ale
but
that
doesnt
mean
it
wasnt
a
good
beer
its
complex
character
makes
it
an
interesting
beer
pours
medium
amber
producing
2
fingers
of
beige
somewhat
lasting
frothy
head
that
recedes
to
a
nice
cap
but
leaves
almost
no
lace
aroma
is
caramel
malt
fruity
lightly
buttered
biscuit
spices
a
hint
of
roast
floral
hops
taste
is

caramel
malt
caramel
candy
apple
biscuit
spices
up
front
with
sweet
caramel
malt
butter
toasted
bread
hints
of
roasted
nuts
orange
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
bitterness
develops
lightly
after
midsip
intensifying
into
the
aftertaste
where
it
begins
to
fade
produces
a
spicy
lightly
roasted
bitter
aftertaste
alcohol
presence
is
minimal
in
the
nose
mouth
but
is
more
prominent
in
the
mouth
especially
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
smooth
tongue
coating
slightly
oily
chewy
this
is
quite
tame
compared
with
some
the
american
craft
winter
warmers
being
offered
strongly
reminds
me
of
what
might
be
called
robust
british
pale
ale
it
certainly
has
the
buttery
character
i
have
come
to
expect
from
british
pale
ales
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
example
of
the
style
it
wasnt
nearly
as
spiced
as
most
american
winter
warmers
and
while
that
did
help
make
it
more
drinkability
it
also
made
the
taste
a
little
more
bland
than
it
could
be
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
pretty
creamy
a
little
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
is
my
limit
anymore
than
that
and
i
would
start
to
get
bored
with
it
but
it
does
drink
smooth
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
good
and
to
me
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
when
it
came
to
the
taste
and
aroma
it
seemed
like
the
english
ale
yeast
was
a
little
too
dominating
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
theres
just
many
more
winter
warmers
that
i
would
rather
have
i
cant
say
i
would
really
recommend
this
beer
but
if
your
really
into
english
ales
it
might
be
worth
a
try
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
i
feel
like
it
needs
a
little
bit
of
work
but
it
does
have
some
potential
there
were
some
things
i
liked
and
some
that
i
did
not
this
isnt
a
favorite
for
this
brewery
and
it
falls
about
in
the
middle
for
the
style
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
solid
ale
keep
up
the
solid
work
it
was
a
bit
old
and
blah
very
nice
reddish
color
smells
sweet
and
malty
slight
carbonation
tastes
a
little
like
newcastle
brown
ale
very
smooth
and
refreshing
pours
a
very
faint
amber
with
some
head
which
leaves
a
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
faintly
of
malt
and
slight
hops
tastes
slightly
sour
and
bitter
the
bitterness
may
be
a
little
too
much
the
sourness
is
nice
slightly
boozya
little
more
than
i
care
forbut
not
bad
very
nice
mouthfeelcreamy
and
rich
its
a
nice
beer
for
the
winter
and
even
with
better
options
i
dont
think
you
could
go
wrong
with
a
bomber
of
this
not
really
my
style
its
probably
a
good
beer
i
just
didnt
like
it
o
this
is
my
first
english
winter
warmer
and
it
is
definitely
different
from
the
american
takes
on
the
style
i
have
had
many
which
are
loaded
with
holiday
spices
i
was
a
bit
surprised
by
how
over
carbonated
the
beer
was
and
at
6
abv
it
wasnt
a
big
warmer
o
overall
a
pretty
solid
winter
warmer
the
flavors
seem
kind
of
soft
but
the
complexity
is
nice
and
all
the
flavors
are
there
fairly
low
in
bitterness
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
winter
brew
overall
this
was
succinct
and
well
put
together
mild
spicing
and
hop
character
and
a
good
balance
only
point
was
the
flavour
is
a
bit
mild
lies
on
the
malts
and
some
floral
no
spice
character
drying
finish
i
think
this
would
be
great

received
this
from
a
buddy
as
a
housewarming
gift
better
than
anticipated
as
i
am
not
normally
a
fan
of
the
winter
style
ales
a
bit
underwhelming
in
pretty
much
every
regard
i
think
i
had
higher
expectations
for
it
but
it
was
a
fine
ale
not
something
that
will
steal
the
show
or
a
holiday
party
but
a
decent
if
somewhat
boring
beer

b
it
doesnt
work
for
me
like
this
web
site
often
overall
this
is
a
very
good
winter
warmer
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
malts
hops
spices
and
warming
effect
and
everything
is
well
balanced
a
seasonal
favorite
pouring
a
vibrant
copper
samuel
smith
winter
welcome
ale
gives
off
a
pleasantly
caramelbiscuit
smell
laced
with
hints
of
holiday
spices
the
gingerbread
and
allspice
notes
give
way
to
a
subtly
fruity
undercurrent
on
the
palate
theres
a
good
amount
of
the
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
but
theyre
accompanied
by
an
earthy
flavor
of
hops
with
notes
of
subtle
citrus
and
grass
the
subtly
builds
with
raspberry
and
red
fruit
flavors
joining
in
the
body
is
moderate
slightly
carbonated
and
slightly
bright
and
bitter
the
ending
is
clean
with
earth
fruit
and
spice
subtly
vanishing
my
first
winter
warmer
and
really
the
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
beers
10
years
ago
this
malty
delicious
treat
is
something
i
look
forward
to
every
winter
it
never
gets
old
o
a
decent
winter
warmer
though
i
dont
know
that
ill
repeat
it
at
least
unless
the
550
ml
bottle
is
on
sale
at
jungle
jims
for
less
than
3
again
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
for
20
years
and
hope
to
do
so
for
another
20
perfect
in
its
own
way
malt
and
yeast
with
a
hint
of
euro
hops
cheers
welcoming
winter
with
a
beer
like
this
wouldnt
be
my
strategy
but
overall
this
is
a
decent
english
brew
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
apple
and
pear
feel
but
nice
malts
and
euro
hops
i
like
the
generous
hop
presence
in
this
even
if
its
not
the
piney
resinous
aggressive
hops
were
used
to
here
in
the
united
states
this
brew
is
certainly
a
good
way
to
welcome
winter
at
least
as
far
as
the
caramel
sweetness
and
the
creaminess
but
i
feel
it
may
be
overcarbed
to
quite
be
the
slow
sipper
i
envision
for
winter
this
is
kinda
averageseeming
these
days
but
drinks
fine
i
give
it
extra
props
because
it
kinda
seems
like
an
oldschool
classic
i
do
wish
it
had
a
more
winter
warmer
feel
though

we
had
unfortunately
i
was
let
down
with
it
i
was
hoping
for
a

in

will
buy
this
again
a
very

a

on

but
otherwise
decent
overall
another
great

note
revised
to
correct
my
horrible
misattribution
of
the
yorkshire
rose
overall
certainly
drinkable
and
likely
warming
but
not
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
winter
is
coming
i
guess
its
already
here
for
those
in
the
northern
hemisphere
i
look
forward
to
this
one
every
year
i
used
to
pick
up
the
bomber
or
two
and
have
one
on
the
solstice
day
to
bring
it
on
in
this
year
i
waited
a
few
days
because
of
various
reasons
nevertheless
i
was
turned
on
to
this
beer
over
a
decade
ago
by
a
good
friend
who
loved
it
dearly
on
to
the
review
what
a
pretty
beer
this
is
it
pours
a
beautiful
toffee
color
the
head
remains
pretty
well
intact
over
the
several
minutes
i
gave
it
to
settle
the
smell
is
of
christmas
candies
and
malt
very
little
hop
character
shows
up
in
this
one
i
am
a
hop
fiend
if
you
didnt
already
guess
but
i
do
like
this
one
for
reasons
unbeknownst
to
me
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
it
has
a
nice
thick
sweet
mouth
feel
almost
cloying
but
not
it
takes
you
to
the
edge
but
reels
you
back
in
at
the
last
minute
overall
i
do
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
this
one
and
it
brings
back
a
certain
time
in
my
life
where
things
were
better
than
i
ever
would
have
realized
they
were
while
living
them
nevertheless
i
do
not
oversell
this
one
it
is
a
good
beer
and
one
to
search
out
to
warm
you
on
those
long
winter
nights
that
could
very
well
last
for
years
the
beer
pours
a
deep
goldenorange
color
with
a
big
fat
and
sudsy
head
of
offwhite
bubbles
that
leave
sticky
tendrils
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
head
has
a
great
lasting
retention
that
i
expect
from
such
a
beer
and
the
beer
overall
looks
like
a
classic
ale
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
beers
body
is
gorgeously
clear
and
it
really
sits
in
the
glass
as
a
pretty
sight
to
see
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
sweet
malt
almost
like
applejuice
with
a
touch
of
vinous
white
wine
thrown
in
soft
minerally
scents
mingle
with
the
sweet
malt
and
further
suggest
a
pinot
gris
or
sweeter
white
wine
to
the
nose
soft
caramel
bread
and
tart
green
apples
hide
in
the
edges
of
the
scent
but
definitely
add
further
definition
i
enjoy
the
smell
of
this
beer
more
and
more
as
it
opens
up
but
i
cant
help
but
think
of
it
more
as
a
sweet
white
wine
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
vinous
with
a
solid
bitter
middle
and
finish
tart
malic
acid
seems
to
be
light
but
present
in
the
beer
and
a
soft
spice
mingles
with
the
bitters
nicely
the
beer
is
very
much
a
testament
to
balances
though
it
gives
a
nice
vinous
sweetness
as
the
strongest
character
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sweet
white
wine
almost
in
the
pinot
gris
range
with
soft
notes
of
green
apple
and
cider
it
then
suddenly
opens
into
beer
with
a
wash
of
bready
malts
and
a
nice
herbal
bitterness
that
balances
out
the
vinous
sweet
of
the
beer
and
carries
it
into
an
earthy
finish
with
a
touch
of
generic
holiday
spices
and
apple
juice
the
finish
is
middling
in
length
with
sweet
crackery
malt
dry
cider
and
goodold
english
hops
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
in
body
with
a
middling
to
strong
carbonation
a
light
astringency
from
the
hops
and
a
thinner
highly
drinkable
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
weight
to
remind
us
its
beer
the
mouth
is
left
dry
save
for
thick
saliva
in
the
cheeks
and
a
bitter
tingle
along
the
middle
of
the
tongue
overall
this
beer
is
good
it
is
far
different
from
other
winter
warmers
and
christmas
beers
that
i
have
had
and
initially
it
disappointed
me
once
i
got
past
the
fact
of
its
subtlety
however
i
was
able
to
appreciate
the
beer
as
yet
another
balanced
and
superb
creation
from
sam
smith
this
beer
nicely
showcases
what
can
be
done
with
malts
hops
and
a
little
touch
of
spices
im
not
wild
about
sweet
white
wines
but
i
found
the
character
interesting
this
is
a
light
and
highly
chuggable
winter
warmer
that
is
defined
by
its
subtlety
and
balance
a
great
execution
of
the
individual
parts
of
brewing
very
nice
flavor
combining
caramel
malt
apple
or
pearlike
fruit
notes
and
bitterness
from
the
hops
problem
is
the
flavor
is
too
muted
would
love
for
them
to
amp
this
up
a
little
bit
overall
3
75
a
good
beer
balanced
sessionable
and
very
enjoyable
it
is
a
striking
looking
beer
it
has
a
unique
taste
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
all
who
enjoy
english
ales
worth
a
shot
for
those
of
you
who
are
not
fans
of
english
ales
overall
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
and
frankly
not
very
following
of
the
style
some
spicy
warming
notes
but
little
malt
character
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
would
buy
it
again
good
for
sharing
overall
i
was
overall
impressed
with
this
brew
i
am
not
a
fan
of
many
of
the
spiced
winter
warmers
which
is
probably
a
reason
why
i
enjoyed
this
one
so
much
there
are
very
few
if
any
traces
of
spices
added
here
incredibly
drinkable
and
i
will
definitely
be
getting
a
couple
more
of
these
before
the
season
is
over
copper

ending
on

slightly
boozy
at
the

easy
and
reminiscent
of
an
esb
i
dont
get
the
winter
warmer
aspect
of
it
enjoyable
nontheless
o
easy
drinking
with
big
malty
notes
but
nothing
extreme
a
serviceable
winter
warmer
that
isnt
overheavy
on
the
spices
like
some
overall
ugh
not
worthy
of
another
bottle
o
not
getting
any
of
the
hops
mentioned
on
the
label
nor
spice
i
typically
associate
with
a
winter
warmer
no
discernible
flaws
here
but
needs
to
be
more
bold
o
i
havent
had
this
in
quite
a
few
years
i
remember
liking
it
either
my
pallet
has
changed
or
this
is
a
bad
year
for
the
winter
welcome
o
easily
drinkable
warming
without
boasting
a
very
high
abv
complex
enough
to
keep
your
interest
samuel
smith
delivers
again
i
drank
several
bottles
and
they
were
all
the
same
so
this
is
not
a
oneoff
bad
bottle
experience
overall
pretty
good
overall
didnt
like
this
as
much
as
the
shepherd
neame
offering
in
this
style
at
first
but
once
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
more
i
found
this
to
be
preferable
a
recommended
selection
for
this
style
another
quality
entry
by
the
always
reliable
samuel
smith
not
the
conventional
american
style
winter
warmer
but
a
nice
incarnation
of
something
comparable
the
pour
is
clear
and
brassy
super
light
for
what
i
was
expecting
and
flaunting
a
sensational
inch
and
a
half
of
snow
white
foam
that
puffs
up
above
the
rim
of
my
globe
light
english
malt
nose
honey
sweet
but
also
bittering
hops
to
balance
things
a
rather
bland
or
rather
mellow
smell
and
taste
to
this
its
sort
of
gentle
not
a
true
winter
warmer
but
more
of
an
introduction
to
the
season
as
the
name
suggests
this
works
in
late
october
but
im
not
sure
how
well
it
would
go
in
january
6
abv
is
nice
for
sessioning
but
not
so
much
for
warming
i
dont
taste
much
spice
either
which
is
okay
amidst
all
the
pumpkin
ales
around
right
now
medium
body
enough
gravity
and
some
bitter
to
counter
the
sweet
in
the
conclusion
a
solid
beer
overall
but
not
one
i
will
probably
go
back
to
honestly
pours
bright
orange
amber
with
a
1
finger
off
white
head
very
sweet
aroma
plum
and
sweet
caramel
are
the
biggest
notes
brown
sugar
and
toffee
are
also
there
the
taste
is
loaded
with
caramel
and
toffee
fresh
not
roasted
hints
of
vanilla
hit
about
mid
mouth
with
some
butterscotch
and
black
pepper
sneaking
in
for
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
huge
dose
carbonation
perhaps
too
much
carbonation
could
use
a
bigger
dose
of
alcohol
to
add
a
bit
of
depth
overall
its
a
decent
little
trip
into
the
winter
ales
but
there
are
a
lot
more
bigger
bolder
beers
in
this
style
for
this
to
have
lasting
appeal
overall
a
rather
tasty
winter
warmer
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
roasted
spice
and
sweet
flavors
which
when
combined
with
the
rather
easy
drinking
feel
and
smooth
tastes
produces
a
great
winter
brew
overall
nice
seasonal
ale
with
a
presence
of
fruits
that
combines
perfectly
with
the
character
of
an
english

and
very

overall
a

pleasant
beer
to

enjoy
the
holiday
season
with
the
body
has
a
rolling
smoothness
and
a
nice
heft
but
the
crispness
bites
hard
and
it
never
lets
go
the
dryness
takes
a
bit
of
a
toll
on
the
palate
as
well
otherwise
its
good
but
it
takes
some
sitting
to
tame
that
bite
o
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
ale
i
agree
with
a
prior
review
in
the
confusion
about
what
style
this
should
be
listed
as
but
regardless
i
think
this
makes
a
fine
english
ale
the
alcohol
content
is
slightly
deceiving
going
from
nose
to
palate
but
its
very
well
balanced
if
not
slightly
underwhelming
flavor
wise
but
does
the
job
with
the
style
i
recommend
this
one
and
will
purchase
again
in
the

overall
this

to
me
an
odd
duck
for
sure
but
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try

very
difficult
to

is
it
just

or
does

sound
like

this
stuff
pours
a
clear

topped
by
a

the
nose
comprises
biscuit
very
light

the

the
taste
holds
notes
of
funky
wheat
dried

light
biscuit
light

and
a
slightly
heavier
touch
of
earthy

than
before
things
dont

that
well
though
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a

dry

overall
a
sad
muddled

nondescript

this
beer
is
an
amber
beauty
with
good
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
herbal
with
a
sweet
aroma
there
is
a
good

presence
in
the
taste
which
adds
to
the
surprisingly
dry
mouthfeel
underneath
the
dryness
you
can
sense
plenty
of

and
malt
the
interplay
of
dry

fascinates

craftsmanship
is

i
recommend
this
as
a

very

taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
nice
blend

seasonal

malts
and
a

i
like
the
subtle
blend
of
spice
with
the
rich
malts
not
overpowering
on
the
spices
as
some
warmers
can
be
feel
is
medium
carbonation
with
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
nice
decent
warmer
with
a
good
blend
of
ingerdients
samuel
smith
is
a
great
outfit
and
although
the
stouts
are
top
notch
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
a
must
try
appearance
of
dark
maple
syrup
color
with
a
full
creamy
head
that
retains
for
several
minutes
smells
of
bread
and
spice
with
a
taste
much
the
same
not
a
cloying
sweet
or
overlyspiced
flavor
as
some
winter
warmers
tend
to
have
mediumbodied
lots
of
maltiness
and
dry
finish
on
the
palate
enjoyed
this
one
enough
to
look
for
it
again
next
year
when
i
want
a
drinkable
holiday
ale
an
ok
brew
but
rather
onedimensional
its
all
about
the
malt
and
this
becomes
boring
as
you
work
your
way
through
the
glass
well
made
with
the
flavour
tending
towards
caramel
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
to
warm
you
up
in
winter
too
bad
it
doesnt
hold
your
attention
i
cant
help
thinking
that
the
addition
of
some
darker
malts
would
improve
it
drinkable
but
nothing
special
no
need
to
seek
it
out
the
verdict
not
bad
if
i
were
picking
a
category
i
would
call
this
a
hoppy
esb
rather
than
a
winter
ale
samuel
smith
makes
decent
beer
this
is
another
solid
example
of
their
work
its
a
nice
and
flavorful
winter
ale
solid
drinkable
winter
warmer
on
the
lower
end
of
alcohol
content
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
certainly
but
for
someone
that
has
begun
to
see
american
craft
beer
as
being
more
original
and
expansive
than
its
european
counterparts
this
is
a
beer
that
would
make
me
buy
some
more
european
brews
i
recommend
grabbing
a
bottle
while
this
is
still
in
season
easy
drinking
english
ale
nothing
really
outstanding
but
good
flavor
o
another
solid
ss
offering
a
very
good
intoductory
ale
for
the
noncraft
drinker
i
can
see
this
brew
appealing
to
most
beer
drinkers

as
well
rather
than
going
through
each
facet
of
the
review
this
ale
is
a
golden
ale
thats
about
it
however
they
did
ale
as
well
as
can
be
asked
instead
of
looking
for
odd
ingredients
or
a
new
twist
samuel
smiths
went
and
made
an
ale
that
is
very
good
the
smell
is
malty
not
unusual
except
that
it
is
good
malts
and
with
nothing
strange
added
the
taste
is
also
malty
a
slightly
bitter
ale
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
yeastiness
again
nothing
unusual
except
that
they
pulled
it
together
quite
well
overall
this
is
more
a
very
good
execution
of
a
standard
traditional
brew
rather
than
something
new
and
unique
im
quite
happy
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
easily
two
fingers
of
cream
colored
head
at
pour
the
head
lingers
well
and
excites
easily
some
lacing
on
the
glass
as
for
the
aroma
its
a
pretty
standard
bitter
aroma
english
malting
and
hops
there
is
a
hint
of
spice
spice
is
more
present
on
the
taste
but
a
fairly
mild
winter
warmer
still
good
rjt
samuel

winter
welcome
ale
35
decent
nothing
to
make
you
want
to
buy
more
than
one
or
two
enjoyable
still
its
held
up
fairly
well
developed
some
nice
esters
over
the
years
but
definitely
passing
its
prime
a
tad
oxidized
and
watery
o
pretty
average
but
not
bad
not
sure
what
exactly
makes
the
winter
warmer
style
but
this
one
tastes
pretty
plain
o
overall
it
wasnt
and
earth
shaker
like
other
samuel
smith
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
but
it
was
a
good
beer
and
great
for
the
season
great
for
the
holidays
recommend
this
the
20122013
release
not
aware
if
they
keep
the
same
recipe
or
not
very
clear
gold
amber
color
with
huge
pure
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
full
cap
the
entire
brew
bitter
yet
savory
smell
raw
grain
aromas
as
well
some
bitterness
at
first
graduating
to
being
chalky
and
metallic
like
pretty
dry
with
a
subtle
honey
like
sweetness
a
little
more
bitter
than
sweet
though
also
getting
some
notes
of
tea
very
nice
creamy
smooth
body
with
average
carbonation
bitter
dry
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
pleasant
overall
its
not
a
masterpiece
but
its
pretty
solid
overall
not
great
especially
for
a
samuel
smith
beer
just
a
very
average
english
ale
o
despite
my
love
for
samuel
smiths
beers
in
general
im
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
its
character
is
pretty
onedimensional
and
the
spice
character
isnt
very
pronounced
everything
just
gets
drowned
out
by
the
overriding
caramel
so
its
just
way
too
sweet
and
simplistic
great
beer
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
really
good
oktoberfest
than
a
winter
beer
dont
really
know
if
i
am
upset
about
that
o
not
really
like
anything
going
on
over
here
in
the
states
this
brew
is
packed
full
of
malty
goodness
and
very
light
on
the
spices
a
solid
brew
but
nothing
really
overwhelming
pours
tawny
brown
with
a
near
solid
sheet
of
fine
whites
vanilla
tea
nougat
some
almond
and
sweet
malts
come
through
the
nose
tastes
fairly
simple
and
subtle
a
good
malty
beverage
with
some
fruity
notes
from
the
english
yeast
some
sweetened
plum
and
bread
flavors
medium
bodied
with
low
carb
and
an
overal
silkiness
i
get
in
most
sam
smith
beers
a
nice
enough
drinking
beer
but
not
likely
going
to
get
it
again
reminds
me
of
a
thickened
kristalweizen
o
very
pleased
with
this
beer
it
is
dynamic
yet
simple
and
every
sip
makes
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
for
sure
i
guess
my
only
negative
is
that
it
is
lower
gravity
for
a
winter
christmas
ale
at
only
6
0abv
i
would
really
enjoy
a
slightly
higher
gravity
that
warms
you
a
little
more
if
this
is
available
in
your
area
give
it
a
try
it
wont
disappoint
overall
not
a
bad
ale
but
not
amazing
either
i
do
enjoy
that
its
not
overly
powerful
in
any
one
taste
and
blends
together
quite
well
combines
together
to
make
an
enjoyable
ale
especially
on
a
nice
winter
night
will
buy
again
if
this
is
a
type
of
winter
warmer
give
me
more
definitely
dont
see
how
this
could
be
a
seasonal
release
for
the
cold
weather
except
for
the
alcohol
warming
properties
but
its
a
very
balanced
simple
yet
effective
beer
overall
i
agree
with
others
that
releases
of
theirs
such
as
their
imperial
stout
would
be
more
suitable
for
the
cold
weather
though
sam
smiths
never
fails
to
disappoint
in
my
life
and
surely
didnt
here
overall
id
call
this
a
solid
winter
brew
its
pretty
tasty
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
id
enjoy
this
with
christmas
dinner
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
bittersweet
aroma
that
i
cant
place
overwhelming
bitter
flavor
not
the
pleasant
hoppy
bitterness
of
a
well
crafted
ale
this
is
unpleasant
and
somewhat
medicinal
taste
reminiscent
of
silly
putty
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
and
the
carbonation
doesnt
lastthe
beer
goes
flat
rather
quickly
i
am
disappointed
in
this
one
as
id
heard
good
things
about
it
really
dont
care
for
this
drank
about
half
and
had
to
drainpour
the
rest
wont
be
getting

again

smelling
exactly

a

decent

feel
not
great
but
not
bad
either
rather
boring
however
i
finished
half
the
bottle
and
that
was
more
than
enough
for
this
dont
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
bright
copper
hue
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
head
dark

with

ends
on
the

end
of
the

with
english
earthy
hops
that
create
a
super
dry
yet
balanced
finish
balance
between
the
semisweet
fruityness
an
earthy
bitternes
balance
between
the
rich
butteriness
and
dryness
touch
of
alcohol
heat
warms
the
belly
i
like
it
much
bigger
and
bolder
than
i
expected
from
sam
smith
creamy
rich
meaty
buttery
dry
and
earthy
kind
of
tastes
like
a
buttered
and
toasted
piece
of
cinnamon
raisin
bread
as
it
warms
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
definantly
not
the
best
from
sam
smith
but
not
bad
either
i
like
my
winter
warmers
to
be
on
the
boozier
side
with
some
very
mild
spice
this
has
neither
still
a
fine
beer
though
poured
into
a
large
brandy
snifter
pours
translucent
toffee
brown
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
theres
a
moderate
amount
of
tiny
bubbles
visible
rising
in
the
beer
the
beer
smells
of
bready
and
caramel
malts
with
some
earthy
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nose
theres
some
breadiness
and
mild
sweetness
from
the
malts
there
are
some
spicy
and
earthy
hop
flavors
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
o
very
balanced
and
on
par
for
winter
ales
and
definitely
well
crafted
taste
lingers
on
the
palate
although
it
is
mild
overall
it
is
delicious
and
very
enjoyabledrinkable
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
not
my
favorite
from
samuel
smith
though
ironically
for
a
chilly
winter
evening
i
would
probably
first
turn
to
samuel
smiths
oatmeal
stout
or
imperial
stout
rather
than
this
winter
seasonal
offering
tasty
but
doesnt
particularly
suggest
anything
wintry
to
me
o
not
tremendously
impressive
i
wish
it
had
done
more
for
me
overall
very
drinkable
another
good
beer
from
samuel
smith
i
would
love
to
try
this
ontap
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
it
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
stronger
version
of
a
typical
dark
mild
i
enjoy
the
malt
sweetness
and
nutty
flavors
b
o
this
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
in
a
winter
ale
but
it
is
a
smooth
and
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
an
enjoyable
draft
without
any
harsh
but
nothing
particularly
exceptional
either
o
this
is
fantastic
i
cant
believe
ive
gone
this
many
years
without
trying
this
beer
it
tastes
shockingly
like
deschutes
winter
warmer
which
is
my
favorite
delicious
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
that
reminds
you
of
the
upcoming
holidays
nice
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
again
when
it
comes
out
in
a
few
months
i
would
really
like
to
have
this
fresh
pours
a
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
fluffy
head
the
nose
has
faint
toffee
notes
the
flavor
profile
includes
malt
caramel
and
seasonal
spices
the
body
is
thinner
than
one
might
expect
for
the
style
this
is
a
decent
winter
ale
but
nothing
special
o

not
my

of

but
very
went
down
easy
prost
this
was
a
nice
winter
warmer
i
lucked
out
by
finding
this
given
its
now
the
middle
of
april
like
the
band
immortal
appropriately
wintery
perhaps
less
of
the
deaddreaddark
and
being
chase
by
demons
through
a
snowy
hell
and
more
sitting
in
front
of
a
fireplace
with
friends
not
a
bad
cold
weather
option
but
ill
stick
with
sam
winter
and
woodstock
inns
wassail
ale
this
is
a
very
distinctive
and
nifty
if
not
sartorial
winter
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
simple
winter
ale
not
much
to
write
home
about
but
its
easy
to
drink
good
but
not
great
winter
warmer
o
overall
samuel
smiths
winter
welcome
ale
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
great
beer
either
where
it
gets
better
marks
for
its
easy
drinking
and
toasty
character
between
the
hint
of
soy
and
the
lackluster
body
it
gets
knocked
down
a
few
marks
i
wouldnt
pick
this
one
over
some
of
samuel
smiths
better
offerings
in
the
ale
category
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
winter
warmer
overall
it
lacks
the
many
of
the
warming
qualities
you
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
very
inviting
winter
warmer
beer
taste

all
the

around
nice

looked

recommend
this

for
anyone
had
it
with
pizza
tonigt
and
it
was
good
will
have
it
again
beer
i
drink

with

and

with
medium

medium
body
and
soft
carbonation
drinkability
although
it
has
rich
woody
taste
and
none
of
its
features
i
found
defects
did
not
convince
me
much
interestingly
pale
winter
warmer
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
first
impression
was
that
this
is
one
pretty
beer
a
nice
copper
color
and
fluffy
head
then
the
aroma
wow
one
of
the
best
delights
my
sniffer
has
had
in
some
time
the
flavor
is
good
but
maybe
not
very
distinct
which
is
probably
the
one
criticism
id
give
it
this
is
easy
drinking
an
does
not
feel
heavy
overall
i
like
it
not
a
favorite
since
the
flavor
is
not
very
robust
but
its
good
o
very
balanced
beer
nothing
to
special
but
it
is
interesting
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
first
really
pale
winter
warmer
ive
ever
had
compared
to
how
dark
most
of
the
other
winter
warmers
ive
had
have
been
delicious
and
refreshing
served
in
a
tulip
on
22012
a
very
clear
and
bright
orange
amber
raises
a
nice
frothy
head
a
mildly
minty
herbal
nose
delivers
bright
notes
of
sweet
candied
caramel
biscuity
malt
and
peach
nectar
fruit
complex
jammy
fruit
and
toasted
bread
flavors
spread
nicely
along
the
palate
into
a
tasty
echoing
sticky
finish
carbonation
seems
spot
on
for
optimum
balanced
flavor
and
hop
bitterness
is
just
subtle
but
mends
everything
together
really
effectively
surprisingly
refreshing
given
that
its
6
goes
down
really
easy
nice
medium
body
liked
this
one
more
and
more
as
i
drank
it
im
partial
to
english
ales
and
this
one
being
a
bit
stronger
allowed
for
a
more
complex
brew
sadly
cant
get
this
one
in
quebec
only
when
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
did
i
feel
the
effects
of
the
alcohol
for
a
winter
beer
i
like
to
at
least
taste
a
bit
of
it
to
go
with
the
caramel
dark
bread
or
spice
that
many
of
them
are
known
for
without
a
label
this
would
have
been
find
to
have
opened
up
and
enjoyed
on
its
own
i
do
think
this
needs
some
tweaking
and
with
so
many
other
winter
beers
available
this
should
only
be
enjoyed
by
those
who
cant
get
enough
sam
smiths
pretty
simple
beer
and
its
way
overpriced
at
8
a
bottle
sitting
next
to
some
of
the
other
offerings
from
sam
smith
i
doubt
id
but
this
again
o
this
is
definitely
tasty
but
i
wouldnt
wait
andor
clamour
over
it
overall
its
one
of
the
milder
winter
beers
that
i
have
had
this
season
and
im
not
quite
sure
how
to
feel
about
that
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasing
brew
and
another
welcome
addition
to
the
range
of
holiday
beers
that
havent
been
spiced
beyond
recognition
indeed
this
is
fairly
simple
farehops
and
maltsin
relatively
normal
quantities
and
strengths
the
sugars
and
fruit
esters
are
cranked
up
a
notch
or
two
for
the
holidays
somewhat
setting
this
beer
apart
but
mainly
this
is
just
good
solid
beer
it
doesnt
quite
qualify
as
worldclass
but
its
certainly
at
the
upper
end
of
good
and
worth
trying

a

this

of
my
favourite
winter
warmers
and
im
always
so
pleased
to
find
it
on
the
shelf
and
now
that
ss
keeps
putting
it
in
brown
bottles
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
a
thick
collar
and
i
am
not
at
all
dissapointed
the
cashier
at
shop
rite
liquors
was
right
when
he
said
that
this
was
an
awesome
brew
the
appearance
is
great
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
foamy
head
the
smell
is
of
burnt
caramel
medium
carbonation
and
i
think
i
could
chug
this

this

not

a

the

drinkability
unlike

which
are

several
at
just
about
anytime
not
just
in

the

is

malty
and
there
is
minimal
spice
with
a
toasted

that
i
had
not
picked
up
on
in
the

the

concord
nh
a
nice
drink
this
is
the
wrong
season
for
it
but
it
serves
very
nicely
as
an
evening
sipper
a
little
heavyboozy
for
repeated
applications
but
thoroughly
pleasant
i
have
yet
to
have
a
dud
from
sam
smith
nice
winter
warmer
as
winter
hangs
on
here
in
maryland
into
april
the
spice
flavor
was
a
bit
heavier
than
i
care
for
but
was
balanced
nicely
by
the
bittering
the
carbonation
could
have
been
toned
down
as
well
very
easy
to
drink
though
april
29th
in
tidewater
va
is
hardly
winter
but
this
is
not
a
strictly
winter
brew
like
mad
elf
or
delirium
noel
pours
a
very
clear
light
amber
with
a
medium
size
frothy
white
head
i
did
not
detect
much
of
a
smell
the
taste
was
very
smooth
and
malty
without
any
of
the
heaviness
or
spiciness
that
i
would
associate
with
a
winter
beer
this
is
a
year
round
brew
i
had
it
with
cheese
and
crackers
and
found
it
a
very
flavorful
and
mild
accompaniment
to
the
snack
very
drinkable
although
6
abv
i
would
have
this
one
again
i
know
this
could
not
have
been
below
50ish
degrees
out
of
the
bottle
but
it
certainly
took
off
got
much
better
with
about
10
minutes
of
blooming
in
a
pint
glass
so
i
would
definitely
recommend
allowing
it
to
come
up
in
temperature
and
get
some
air
its
nice
a
welcome
change
from
the
americanized
spiced
versions
if
you
like
scottish
ales
i
would
definitely
give
this
a
shot
and
if
you
just
like
a
nice
easy
to
drink
subtly
sweet
malt
profile
then
this
is
for
you
could
pair
this
with
a
nice
sharp
cheddar
or
even
a
softer
riper
cheese
as
well
as
any
meat
potato
combos
a
nice
winter
warmer
and
one
i
recommend
after
its
warmed
and
will
enjoy
annually
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
tastes
very
good
but
at
the
price
its
very
easy
to
find
a
comparable
or
better
beer
for
far
less
comments
very
tasty
winter
warmer
not
overdone
with
spices
as
in
most
ww
almost
an
old
ale
but
not
as
high
abv
as
most
old
ales
good
flavor
well
balanced
again
a
bit
sweet
after
a
full
bottle
but
a
smaller
portion
would
be
perfect
very
drinkable
could
make
decent
session
fare
but
at
6
alcohol
perhaps
its
better
suited
to
sipping
in
front
of
the
fire
with
family
and
friends
on
a
cold
winter
night
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
next
winter
overall
a
great
brew
it
wouldnt
hurt
if
it
was
a
tad
bit
stronger
as
in
other
winter
warmers
but
it
gets
the
job
done
will
definitely
have
this
again
good
stuff

translucent

with
about
an
inch
of
light
tan
head
that
leaves

good

smells
fruity
spicy
and
biscuity
tastes
sweet
fruity
and
malty
with
a
roasty
caramel
character
that
surfaces
toward
the
finish
and
just
a
hint
of
a
metalic
quality
complex
and
pleasing
flavor
whose
only
flaw
is
letting
the
alcohol
show
a
bit
much
for
a
6abv
offering
that
flaw
fades
after
a
few
sips
creamy
full
mouthfeel
as
i
have
more
the
rich
caramel
malt
becomes
more
apparent
very
drinkable
considerin
how
rich
and
full
it
is
wow
this
is
a
good
beer
definitely
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
before
the
winters
out
i
think
its
a
nice
and
enjoyable
beer
but
its
not
something
id
go
for
too
often
not
as
wintery
as
some
winter
beers
ive
had
and
if
i
had
a
wider
selection
id
probably
try
something
else
but
i
think
if
you
like
beers
with
some
sweeter
hints
like
this
its
something
good
to
at
least
try
this
beer
is
much
better
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
cold
it
is
not
very
good
its
only
somewhat
warming
wiith
some
vague
restrained
spiciness
its
decent
but
not
one
of
this
great
brewerys
better
offerings
imo
d
an
ok
holiday
ale
light
and
drinkable
but
not
really
what
i
would
be
looking
for
in
this
style
warmer
i
am
looking
forward
to
many
more
years
of
this
big
clear
bottle
with
nice
label
the
smell
is
alright
biscuit
malt
and
caramel
i
foud
this
to
be
nicely
flavored
for
the
style
with
toasted
caramel
and
spices
fruit
comes
through
a
bit
and
it
finishes
with
an
herbal
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
but
a
little
too
expensive
for
me
to
buy
more
2006
bottle
gifted
from
lcbo
in
toronto
sampled
in
early
2007
pours
a
clear
brown
with
little
carbonation
gentle
spicy
aroma
and
a
nice
spicy
taste
although
the
taste
fades
a
tad
too
quickly
for
my
liking
perhaps
this
is
one
that
improves
with
aging
da
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winterstyle
brews
with
good
balance
and
not
overly
spiced
or
sweetened
pretty
easy
to
drink
at
6
poured
a
golden
color
clear
small
offwhite
head
with
no
lacing
it
smells
of
butterscotch
the
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
some
bitter
hops
not
very
distinct
this
is
my
first
english
version
of
the
winter
warmer
definitely
not
as
spicy
as
the
american
counterpart
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
watery
fizzy
carbonation
crisp
this
is
quite
neutral
of
an
ale
but
very
drinkable
overall
decent
but
not
malty
enough
to
cut
through
those
cold
winter
evenings
for
me
i
like
to
break
this
one
out
once
a
year
to
enjoy
but
thats
about
it
overall
a
nice
fairly
straightforward
beer
i
could
definitely
knock
back
a
few
of
these
if
only
i
could
afford
to
buy
them

taste

in

coupled
with

and
a

finish
mouthfeel
not
quite
as
smooth
as
it
could
be
and
drinkability
is
not
too
bad
either
just
a
bit
below
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
sam
smith
not
what
i
expected
in
a
winter
warmer
someone
told
me
its
because
its
an
english
warmer
they
dont
spice
like
others
i
will
not
seek
this
out
again
too
much
money
for
so
little
flavor
this
beer
was
not
as
spicy
and
complex
as
i
expected
from
a
winter
beer
but
was
very
acceptable
for
sure
d
not
bad
give
it
some
more
carbonation
and
density
and
i
could
come
back
to
it
again
otherwise
ill
skip
it
this
one
just
screams
british
beer
deep
light
brown
body
perfect
carbonation
which
adds
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
its
actually
hard
to
tell
if
its
an
ale
or
lager
as
it
has
british
characteristics
of
both
the
sweetness
of
carmel
malts
and
the
mellow
bite
of
low
alpha
hops
just
barely
sticky
possibly
some
spices
are
present
but
all
the
flavors
are
very
mellow
and
round
and
work
in
harmony
very
nutty
aftertaste
a
great
winter
tradition
ive
enjoyed
for
almost
10
years
cheers
i
really
like
this
beer
i
buy
it
every
year
this
year
is
different
enough
that
i
think
it
deserves
a
rereview
first
thing
thats
different
brown
bottles
pours
redamber
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
much
more
malty
that
i
recall
lots
of
caramel
toffee
baking
bread
the
taste
has
the
same
malt
profile
with
a
little
bit
of
citrusy
hop
twang
mouthfeel
is
a
fair
medium
i
can
say
this
is
fairly
different
than
i
remember
and
ive
been
buying
this
every
year
for
some
time
while
a
lot
of
the
malt
tastes
and
smells
seem
cleaner
and
clearer
it
also
seems
to
be
lacking
in
some
of
the
yeastybeery
elements
that
i
would
say
made
up
a
good
part
of
the
charm
that
this
beer
had
maybe
this
is
due
to
the
brown
bottles
maybe
a
different
yeast
stain
with
the
cleaner
flavors
and
larger
profile
that
allows
technically
speaking
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
thing
although
and
maybe
this
is
just
me
i
kinda
miss
the

not

a
very

warmer
personally
i
prefer
something
a
bit
more
heavy
in
the
dead
of
winter
but
that
doesnt
keep
this
from
being
a
decently
tasty
brew
thumbs
up
my
original
review
was
last
years
vintage
to
which
i
gave
a
3
6
and
complained
about
the
clear
bottles
my
wishes
were
fulfilled
when
i
found
a
brownglass
550
ml
victorian
pint
for
this
years
vintage
figured
i
should
rereview
the
beer
it
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
reduces
to
a
collar
the
aroma
is
pleasant
with
red
apples
cherries
toasted
malts
floral
hops
and
light
spice
it
tastes
of
roastedtoasted
malts
greenleafy
oily
and
floral
hops
and
a
bitterness
that
begins
light
but
becomes
medium
the
body
is
fairly
carbonated
medium
and
leaves
a
light
to
medium
finish
a
pretty
good
english
ale
and
im
glad
they
switched
to
the
brown
bottles
the
pour
from
the
new
brown
bottle
into
my
sam
smith
pint
glass
raises
a
bubbly
three
finger
head
that
is
quite
loud
and
fizzles
down
quickly
to
a
still
respectable
halffinger
which
leaves
a
bit
of
sticky
lacing
the
head
is
offwhite
over
a
delightfully
hued
deep
ambercopper
body
the
nose
is
sweet
and
a
bit
minerally
and
overall
seems
a
bit
thin
the
taste
is
full
of
that
characteristic
minerally
sam
smith
flavor
but
has
a
nice
breadiness
and
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
notes
the
mouth
is
noticeably
thin
and
has
a
fine
but
cutting
carbonation
this
is
a
very
quaffable
ale
that
i
would
love
to
have
regualar
access
to
this
was
the
first
year
in
a
long
time
that
i
got
the
winter
welcome
as
with
what
everyone
has
already
said
i
am
glad
that
they
have
finally
gone
to
brown
bottles
in
the
past
it
was
hit
and
miss
i
guess
with
the
clear
bottles
and
off
flavors
this
year
the
brew
was
very
nice
had
a
copper
color
to
it
with
a
smallish
light
tan
head
that
had
some
legs
the
aroma
was
not
too
shabby
a
lot
of
caramel
was
present
mixed
in
with
a
toasted
scent
the
taste
is
quite
nice
easy
drinking
as
i
have
really
polished
it
off
when
i
was
putting
together
my
hiking
equipment
nice
malt
flavor
at
the
start
that
really
seems
to
carry
right
through
also
notes
of
different
spices
through
out
and
a
slight
hop
finish
this
is
a
nice
brew
one
that
i
use
to
really
look
forward
to
probably
5
years
ago
guess
i
kind
of
forgot
about
it
glad
that
i
gave
it
a
try
this
year
will
be
one
that
i
look
for
around
the
holidays
in
the
future
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
mild
to
medium
in
carbonation
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again
pours
an
attractive
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
light
khaki
colored
head
aroma
consists
of
caramel
malt
toasted
biscuit
and
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
medium
in
body
light
malt
flavor
upfront
and
mildly
hoppy
throughout
herbal
floral
hoppiness
in
the
finish
contributes
to
a
light
bitterness
toward
the
back
this
is
easily
drinkable
although
its
not
whats
expected
now
with
all
the
seasonal
spicing
and
higher
alcohol
levels
despite
its

abv
in
most
american
winter
warmers
this
is
a
nice
and
drinkable
english
ale
this
beer
has
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
white
head
the
beer
has
high
clarity
with
low
head
retention
and
a
it
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
and
sweetness
maybe
a
bit
of
spice
cinnamon
or
ginger
perhaps
as
well
the
taste
is
fairly
well
rounded
fruity
sweetness
mixed
with
a
slight
acidic
taste
from
the
spices
and
hops
there
is
also
a
bit
of
metallic
tangyness
in
there
as
well
the
alcohol
comes
through
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
acidic
fairly
highly
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
better
than
fair
there
is
nothing
challenging
or
off
putting
about
this
beer
its
not
bad
fine
conditioning
make
this
a
smooth
and
easy
drinker
and
a
welcome
one
at
that
while
not
as
gimmicky
as
many
winter
warmers
this
one
makes
a
casual
yet
interesting
appearance
which
i
will
certainly
have
again
d
good
its
light
in
body
and
not
overthetop
in
spices
reminds
me
basically
of
an
english
ale
with
just
a
tad
bit
of
spice
thereby
allowing
it
to
call
itself
a
winter
ale
md
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
is
easy
going
this
is
a
solid
tasty
offering
i
actually
could
drink
alot
of
these
and
it
is
obviously
a
well
crafted
brew
but
i
prefer
my
winter
warmers
to
be
a
little
darker
or
spicier
this
sort
of
fell
in
the
middle
a
pleasant
experience
overall
the
drinkability
is
very
good
great
no
prob
knocking
several
of
these
back
but
all
in
all
not
a
beer
i
will
get
lots
of
too
many
others
to
dring
that
have
the
whole
package
prosit
mk
d
i
could
drink
these
all
day
16
9oz
bottle
poured
a
nice
clear
dull
brown
maybe
a
little
orange
in
there
with
a
bubblyfluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
after
a
minute
the
smoothness
and
subtle
spiciness
really
make
this
a
nice
and
mild
beer
to
drink
little
toastly
malt
as
well
as
caramel
presence
there
too
carbonation
gives
a
somewhat
prickly
mouthfeel
at
first
but
overall
a
smoothness
takes
over
the
is
a
light
version
of
the
winter
ale
making
it
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
find
alot
of
winter
welcomes
to
be
too
overwhelming
for
long
sessions
but
this
one
i
think
deserves
one
session
a
year
this
offering
from
samuel
smiths
pours
a
maroon
burnt
sienna
leaving
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
and
a
crystal
clear
body
the
aroma
is
caramel
plum
yeast
fruity
faint
hop
essence
the
taste
starts
nutty
and
fruity
with
slight
funky
esters
with
a
tart
acidic
bitterness
rounded
out
by
more
bready
fruity
plum
fig
sweetness
this
is
a
good
beer
mild
but
satisfying
d
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
i
really
wish
we
could
get
this
in
brown
bottles
because
im
always
hesitant
to
buy
imports
in
clear
glass
but
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
happy
holidays
and
merry
christmas
drinkability
quite
drinkable
not
overly
heavy
like
a
lot
of
winter
ales
delicate
and
complex
flavors
to
be
admired
this
makes
it
a
very
light
ale
ive
read
that
this
was
one
of
the
original
winter
warmers
and
modern
variations
are
much
stronger
and
bolder
i
respect
winter
welcome
for
this
although
i
dont
think
it
stands
up
to
modern
winter
warmer
standards
it
does
not
have
big
malt
presence
among
other
lacking
qualities
it
would
make
a
weak
old
ale
or
a
good
solid
english
pale
ale
not
to
shabby
i
would
buy
this
again
as
long
as
i
can
find
it
around
here
when
i
saw
this
at
one
of
my
local
stores
i
just
had
to
pick
it
up
i
have
had
several
other
samuel
smiths
and
they
have
all
been
fantastic
so
i
wanted
to
try
this
one
out
too
it
wasnt
until
i
got
home
and
poured
a
bottle
into
my
mug
that
i
noticed
that
the
four
bottles
in
the
pack
were
from
the
20052006
series
i
bought
this
on
dec
6
2006
i
guess
the
6
alcohol
has
kept
this
four
pack
alright
because
it
wasnt
flat
or
soursunky
it
poured
a
wonderful
amber
color
with
a
nice
think
foamy
head
the
tase
was
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
something
extra
ginger
perhaps
i
really
wish
i
had
this
brew
before
so
that
i
could
compare
it
to
see
if
the
age
has
affected
it
at
all
well
i
recommend
the
20052006
that
is
if
anyone
out
there
still
has
any
around
i
would
love
to
hear
some
comments
letting
me
know
if
this
beer
can
be
aged
for
a
year
with
out
it
going
bad
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
even
at
6
alcohol
there
are
just
so
many
winter
brews
to
try
i
dont
know
if
ill
get
around
to
picking
another
up
this
will
make
my
list
of
gets
for
next
winter
thanks
beerhandy
md
smooth
enough
so
the
girlfriend
didnt
hate
it
but
a
nice
winter
beer
that
would
keep
an
athabaskan
warm
enjoyable
and
shareable
a
great
holiday
beer
if
not
one
of
the
best
appears
a
very
clear
orangebrown
color
in
the
glass
with
a
1finger
offwhite
head
that
leaves
hints
of
lacing
smells
of
buttered
rum
caramel
and
a
slight
hint
of
breadyeast
tastes
like
buttered
rumbutterscotch
lots
of
biscuit
flavor
a
very
nice
peppery
finish
with
hints
of
nutmeg
and
a
good
amount
of
hops
bitterness
these
flavors
playing
off
of
one
another
put
me
more
in
the
mind
of
winter
and
the
holidays
than
the
candied
sweetness
of
other
winter
warmers
mouthfeel
is
quite
buttery
and
oily
which
actually
seems
just
right
to
match
the
flavors
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
understated
and
classy
beer
that
truly
does
make
a
nice
winter
warmer
the
spices
seem
right
for
a
cold
night
by
a
fire
and
the
abv
is
just
enough
to
give
you
a
kick
of
warmth
without
overdoing
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
really
not
special
samuel
smith
has
a
lot
of
better
offerings
out
there
the
porter
being
my
favorite
mouthfeel
is
rather
thick
and
coats
the
mouth
well
drinkability
is
so
so
i
probably
wont
be
buying
another
but
ill
definately
finish
this
bottle
d
another
solid
effort
from
s
s
but
while
most
of
their
brews
are
very
good
they
are
not
worth
the
price
in
my
opinion
half
way
through
i
was
thinking
i
would
like
another
but
by
the
end
of
the
glass
id
decided
id
had
enough
of
that
its
a
good
well
crafted
beer
but
i
didnt
find
inspiring
and
i
was
of
the
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
attitude
d
pretty
good
beer
i
found
it
interesting
that
it
tasted
very
different
than
it
smelled
d
very
different
from
the
us
winter
warmers
that
i
have
been
enjoying
this
season
thick
with
a
much
milder
hop
presence
this
beer
fills
quickly
leaving
me
struggling
to
finish
this
550ml
bottle
overall
not
worth
the
3
99
i
paid
for
it
when
im
getting
sixers
of
sierra
nevadas
celebration
ale
for
7
bucks
im
not
going
to
waste
time
on
this
d
a
pretty
good
beer
enjoyable
drinkable
though
not
one
id
rave
about
has
an
abv
on
the
low
end
for
the
style
so
it
could
almost
be
enjoyed
as
a
session
beer
me
id
probably
have
one
and
move
on
worth
a
try
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
effervescence
is
played
way
down
to
the
point
of
being
a
bit
boring
its
thin
and
transparent
and
for
a
winter
warmer
id
like
it
to
have
more
body
where
it
lacks
in
mouthfeel
however
this
ones
hard
to
beat
in
drinkability
the
solid
balanced
experience
is
easy
to
put
down
without
much
effort
drinkability
a
good
winter
welcome
brew
to
be
had
every
winter
season
nice
wintry
feel
not
quite
sweet
enough
to
make
me
want
more
than
a
couple
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
good
balance
alcohol
presence
is
not
obvious
so
i
wouldnt
say
its
really
a
warmer
comparing
to
last
years
version
this
one
seems
to
have
a
little
less
flavor
character
but
also
more
bitterness
drinkability
is
good
but
i
would
probably
only
have
one
in
a
sitting
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
red
color
with
a
big
head
the
smell
is
pleasant
and
mostly
of
sweet
sticky
malts
there
is
a
hint
of
green
apple
and
other
candied
fruits
as
well
in
the
taste
the
malts
again
dominate
with
a
juicy
consistancy
the
carbonation
is
perfect
and
lets
the
malts
dance
on
your
tongue
a
bit
before
washing
down
there
is
also
a
suprising
amount
of
variation
in
the
taste
for
being
so
malt
heavy
the
aftertaste
lingers
with
a
wonderfully
fruity
taste
a
good
one
to
try
the
mouth
is
medium
and
rather
complex
wellcarbonated
enough
to
keep
this
one
from
getting
bogged
down
in
all
the
sugar
and
fruitiness
and
then
it
really
dries
out
on
the
end
its
very
drinkable
ive
never
found
this
brew
to
be
earth
shaking
yet
always
find
it
enjoyable
its
pretty
hoppy
for
a
winter
warmer
though
the
toasty
character
is
nice
not
exactly
warming
though
more
like
an
esb
drinkability
seeing
that
i
bought
a
couple
more
bottles
for
the
weekend
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
fine
other
than
the
dryness
which
brings
the
drinkability
down
drinkability
a
great
seasonal
beer
that
i
really
need
to
stock
up
on
d
pretty
nice
certainly
would
not
object
to
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
a
good
beer
and
in
my
opinion
a
bit
underated
winter
welcome
is
something
to
look
forward
to
every
year
a
solid
beer
drinkability
this
is
very
good
and
very
sessionable
classic
flavors
of
an
english
ale
smokey
woody
with
a
distinct
hoppyness
to
it
some
notes
of
spice
and
caramel
as
well
nice
amber
color
with
a
beautiful
nearly
twoinch
cream
head
had
a
nice
earthy
character
to
it
and
the
flavors
seem
to
be
well
balanced
with
the
amount
of
alcohol
present
definitely
a
winter
warmer
as
it
kept
me
toasty
on
a
bitter
cold
day
pours
a
very
clear
toasted
brown
color
with
a
sticky
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
on
its
way
down
lots
of
toasty
smells
on
the
nose
along
with
a
bunch
of
yeasty
doughy
smells
rich
and
inviting
no
spice
on
the
tongue
well
balanced
zesty
dough
notes
compete
with
slightly
bitter
earthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
dextrineish
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
its
not
as
spicy
as
the
winter
warmers
most
americans
are
used
to
but
its
highly
drinkable
and
full
of
nice
grainy
toasty
malt
flavors
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
to
me
for
the
style
though
it
seems
appropriate
for
the
flavors
that
this
beer
brings
to
the
palate
i
like
it
but
i
also
look
forward
to
some
winter
warmers
with
a
bit
more
spice
and
a
bit
more
umph
pretty
close
to
an
english
pale
ale
with
toasty
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
good
overall
beer
pours
to
a
light
copper
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
and
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
not
real
strong
but
has
hints
of
mal
and
bread
relatively
thin
body
with
an
okay
taste
of
maltwith
hints
of
nuts
initial
palate
is
the
same
metallic
finish
i
seem
to
get
with
all
samuel
smith
beers
but
this
improves
as
the
beer
warms
not
great
but
not
bad
for
samuel
smiths
nice
one
inch
frothyoffwhite
head
quickly
became
a
half
inch
head
moderately
malty
aroma
with
some
light
bread
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
hoppy
aroma
light
yeast
not
much
in
th
eway
of
spiceness
that
i
had
expected
from
this
style
noce
on
the
tongue
though
nothing
really
special
about
this
beer
it
seemed
like
just
a
little
fuller
english
ale
really
d
i
like
this
beer
a
bit
more
than
i
remember
it
regardless
still
a
boring
beer
but
well
put
together
reviewing
the
20062007
bottle
i
just
got
pours
a
clear
coppery
brown
with
a
nice
head
that
laced
up
pretty
quick
smells
hint
at
caramel
malts
but
not
much
to
it
taste
is
metallic
and
extremely
dry
hints
of
sweet
malts
in
the
taste
but
again
rather
lacking
mouthfeel
is
extremely
dry
dont
reckon
i
will
get
this
one
again
with
so
many
other
tastier
more
available
winter
brews
around
pours
clear
copper
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
few
fingers
of
nice
creamy
foam
smells
somewhat
lacking
hard
water
green
leafy
hops
a
bit
of
caramel
flavor
is
better
toasted
biscuit
malts
lead
to
a
chewy
and
nutty
rounded
caramel
center
finishes
with
some
lingering
leafy
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
clean
medium
body
with
big
carbonation
a
little
uneven
but
pretty
pleasing
in
the
end
good
english
ale
yeah
quite
possibly
but
scored
to
style
very
poor
overall
the
best
quality
of
this
brew
is
definitely
its
balance
its
a
bit
lacking
still
in
its
overall
flavor
though
a
decent
seasonal
ale
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
poured
a
dark
gold
with
a
thick
long
lasting
head
the
smell
was
extremely
hoppy
the
taste
is
well
balanced
between
mellow
malt
and
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
thick
and
slightly
chewy
i
consider
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
am
glad
wintertime
is
near
perhaps
i
should
revisit
this
in
a
few
days
perhaps
with
a
warmer
example
md
thick
and
heavy
light
carbonation
i
feel
this
beer
gets
better
as
you
work
through
the
pint
i
also
noticed
that
it
has
gotten
a
good
deal
sweeter
in
the
6
months
after
the
holiday
great
in
the
winter
but
good
during
all
seasons
note
excellent
shakespeare
quote
on
the
bottle
blessing
of
your
heart
you
brew
good
ale
ha
it
certainly
gets
better
and
mellower
as
it
warms
but
still
if
im
going
for
some
holiday
cheer
beer
i
can
think
of
a
zillion
belgians
id
rather
spend
time
with
taste
is
very
malty
and
sweet
with
some
roasted
chocolate
and
baked
bread
notes
bit
of
spice
but
definitely
nowhere
near
as
spicy
as
the
celebration
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
but
an
unexpectedly
bitter
aftertaste
lowers
drinkability
mouthfeel
not
bad
carbonation
helps
bring
this
par
beer
some
points
for
a
renowned
brewery
overall
an
ale
that
smells
like
a
winterxmas
ale
but
drinks
and
tastes
like
a
masterfully
built
pale
ale
with
a
ghostly
dash
of
good
whiskey
somewhere
in
there
very
subtle
but
complex
you
can
ponder
or
pound
this
ale
its
very
multidimensional
excellent
basically
a
bold
pale
ale
in
strength
spices
and
flavor
still
a
bit
ordinary
a
brilliant
and
bright
copper
color
with
aromas
of
nuts
nutmeg
caramel
and
a
light
fruitiness
tastes
moderately
malty
nutty
spices
and
woodsy
a
mild
apple
and
berry
tartness
persistes
in
the
tastes
and
feel
moderate
weight
and
creaminess
to
the
mouth
finishes
clean
dry
and
less
sweet
than
was
expecting
a
moderate
alcohol
warmth
and
flavor
shows
throughout
leaving
a
light
plastic
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
moderate
in
every
sense
of
the
word
will
never
offend
but
difficult
to
brag
about
either
d
quite
drinkable
though
a
bit
light
in
the
body
for
a
winter
warmer
the
aspects
that
make
up
the
beer
are
wellinterwoven
and
successfully
pulled
off
though
nothing
is
by
itself
particularly
interesting
or
defining
a
very
tasty
english
brew
nice
seasonal
offering
and
consistant
year
after
year
d

very
warm
and
inviting
perfect
for
a
cold
night
for
sipping
and
talking
very
enjoyable
and
satisfying
definitely
a
winter
ale
this
review
and
beer
were
sort
of
a
midcareer
review
for
me
as
i
remember
drinming
this
brew
back
in
the
early
90s
as
my
beer
experimentation
began
looking
back
my
palate
has
certainly
developed
and
the
seach
for
great
beers
continues
on
some
fruit
pear
perhaps
quite
drinkable
overall
i
like
this
beer
way
more
than
i
expected
to
my
favorite
from
sam
smith
maybe
if
youre
looking
for
a
winterstyle
ale
that
doesnt
overpower
this
would
be
a
fine
choice
this
winterwelcome
ale
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
looks
very
similar
to
a
best
bitter
on
speed
so
not
a
lot
more
complex
just
a
couple
of
pounds
of
extra
malt
or
sugar
85
pale
malt
10
crystal
5
sugar
something
like
that
fermented
with
a
fruity
english
yeast
finished
this
sounds
like
i
cannot
appreciate
this
beer
but
actually
i
like
it
i
dont
know
if
i
would
have
this
again
oh
wait
i
have
three
left
maybe
im
ultra
sensitive
to
the
off
flavors
in
light
struck
beers
but
i
feel
the
clear
bottle
did
this
beer
a
misservice
too
bad
i
normally
really
like
sam
smiths
offerings
this
one
is
quite
average
doverall
a
pretty
good
brew
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
i
could
have
maybe
one
more
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
halfinch
light
colored
foam
cap
high
clarity
smell
is
faint
and
seems
to
be
just
bit
hoppy
with
some
carmelly
malt
aroma
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
and
malty
but
it
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
being
almost
stale
or
skunky
perhaps
some
hop
flavor
present
but
not
really
bitter
it
feels
kind
of
thin
and
watery
on
the
palate
although
carbonation
is
decent
the
off
flavors
unfortunately
made
me
not
want
to
try
this
again
i
dont
know
if
this
one
saw
too
much
light
somewhere
along
the
way
or
what
someday
i
might
give
it
another
chance
easily
drinkable
i
have
had
a
fair
share
of
these
over
the
years
i
know
its
a
winter
warmer
but
its
no
sipping
beer
it
would
actually
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
outside
on
a
hot
day
poured
a
warm
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
fell
to
moderate
lacing
smells
richly
of
caramel
and
malt
a
hint
of
hop
freshness
present
tastes
sweet
caramel
malt
heavier
than
expected
hint
of
butterschnapps
butterscotch
also
present
medium
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
balanced
a
little
heavier
than
expected
carries
its
abv
nicely
overall
a
pleasing
brew
somewhat
pricey
but
would
purchase
again
very
drinkable
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
from
start
to
finish
its
so
dry
im
not
sure
i
can
really
recommend
it
its
given
me
a
bit
of
heartburn
it
pains
me
to
say
it
but
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
one
oh
dont
get
me
wrong
ill
give
it
a
go
again
next
year
i
respect
the
old
brewery
they
know
what
theyre
doing
sigh
maybe
next
year
d
drinkability
is
good
a
few
of
these
should
warm
you
up
2005
2006
release
clear
copper
color
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
aroma
of
musty
grassy
hops
nearly
skunky
and
a
metallic
cloud
hovering
beneath
flavor
is
pale
malt
some
light
brown
sugar
and
toffee
accented
with
cinnamon
and
ripe
fruits
a
grassy
hop
jumps
out
of
the
finish
followed
by
a
fruity
tartness
that
morphs
to
a
lingering
syrupy
sweetness
theres
also
the
reemergence
of
the
metallic
nuance
in
the
lingering
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
and
satisfying
pretty
drinkable
especially
now
when
its
15
degrees
out
there
no
doubt
this
does
exactly
what
it
says
it
does
warms
you
right
up
worth
a
try
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
id
hate
to
try
one
that
was
sitting
on
the
shelf
next
to
the
lights
a
pour
a
nice
deep
amber
to
copper
color
the
head
adequate
frothy
the
lace
a
fine
covering
sheet
nose
is
sweet
mostly
malt
hints
of
spice
start
malt
and
lightly
sweet
top
skimp
in
feel
finish
is
moderately
carbonated
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
quite
dry
and
a
drinkable
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
world
class
brewery
drinkability
decent
could
drink
another
one
tonight
but
not
right
after
this
one
pours
out
a
very
clear
amber
brew
with
minimal
carbonationand
a
2
finger
head
has
a
skunky
type
smell
to
iti
cant
make
out
much
more
taste
a
bit
like
it
smells
kinda
a
lil
lile
a
euro
brew
at
firstnot
much
sweetness
has
some
hop
goodness
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
much
milder
brew
then
expectednot
bad
nothing
over
the
top
about
it
but
not
ba
either
i
give
it
a
c
overall
it
is
a
good
english
ale
but
nothing
all
that
special
it
is
a
little
expensive
though
but
i
think
it
is
a
good
solid
beer
drinkablity
this
would
make
a
good
winter
warmer
as
the
style
suggests
but
i
think
the
assertiveness
of
the
taste
may
mean
that
i
would
prefer
something
just
a
little
less
cloying
for
any
serious
amount
of
imbibing
in
2004
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
halfprice
case
30
of
s
s
s
winter
welcome
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
tried
the
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
id
love
to
be
able
to
get
that
deal
again
overall
its
easy
to
drink
tastes
and
smells
pleasant
good
session
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
a
very
solid
beer
poured
a
very
nice
deep
copper
amber
color
very
clear
and
a
had
a
nice
offwhite
tan
head
that
didnt
stick
around
very
long
but
still
left
a
decent
lace
the
smells
were
a
little
sweet
and
slightly
nutty
i
thought
the
taste
was
good
but
nothing
special
there
were
hints
of
sweetness
and
grains
and
had
small
hoppiness
with
no
lingering
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
like
i
said
this
is
nothing
special
and
i
had
difficulty
getting
any
wowfactor
from
this
beer
but
still
its
very
smooth
and
drinks
well
overall
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
i
know
guys
who
drink
this
exclusively
while
it
lasts
buying
all
they
can
get
the
caramel
malt
is
the
main
profile
but
there
is
a
spicy
hop
character
there
as
well
recommended
one
thing
samuel
smith
does
well
and
one
of
the
high
points
of
this
beer
is
drinkability
all
of
there
brews
are
easy
to
drink
and
well
done
for
their
respective
styles
and
this
is
no
exception
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
huge
head
and
very
good
lace
smells
are
faint
but
decent
maily
hops
with
some
malt
mixed
in
and
a
touch
of
apple
taste
is
again
more
hoppy
than
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
malt
and
that
hint
of
apple
come
through
at
the
end
a
bit
watery
and
week
for
a
winter
warmer
imho
nice
drinkability
though
give
one
a
try
opinion
well
this
isnt
my
favorite
offering
from
sam
smiths
lineup
the
beer
has
a
good
flavor
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
bit
uneventful
even
though
it
is
a
malty
beer
the
hops
give
it
a
bit
of
a
harsh
edge
that
didnt
totally
agree
with
me
i
would
drink
the
beer
again
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
seeking
it
out
like
i
do
their
oatmeal
and
imperial
stouts
found
an
unopened
box
at
the
local
so
i
opened
it
grab
one
and
took
it
home
made
dinner
had
it
while
thing
were
still
in
the
oven
i
havent
had
one
in
years
as
with
many
of
sams
products
due
to
skunking
well
praise
be
this
one
was
fresh
a
nice
oarngebrown
body
with
a
white
cap
and
good
lacing
slight
butterynutty
smell
with
a
hint
of
caramel
twang
nice
average
taste
of
ss
beer
full
round
maltyness
cut
with
the
noble
hops
and
metalic
zing
well
i
can
say
i
will
almost
never
buy
one
of
these
again
a
shrug
of
a
beer
not
much
of
a
ww
and
thin
in
the
mouth
i
still
shake
my
head
every
time
i
see
clear
bottles
but
im
done
trying
to
figure
out
why
they
still
use
them
clear
copper
color
a
slight
euroskunk
aroma
as
soon
as
you
pop
the
cap
other
than
that
its
mostly
pale
malts
and
a
hint
of
spices
tastes
are
very
buttery
and
diacetyl
abounds
pretty
harsh
mouthfeel
that
makes
me
want
to
brush
my
teeth
after
every
sip
nothing
too
impressive
here
from
a
brewery
thats
supposed
to
have
a
good
reputation
not
one
of
the
better
winter
ales
you
can
try
you
can
get
a
lot
better
beers
that
are
a
lot
less
expensive
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
distinctive
sam
smith
musty
smell
and
flavor
this
is
a
good
one
also
dont
expect
the
spices
of
other
winter
brews
i
guess
what
im
saying
is
dont
expect
anything
from
this
one
nothing
special
just
an
easy
drinking
english
beer
overall
after
all
the
bitching
nothing
but
love
sam
smiths
rules
clear
dark
gold
almost
like
a
euro
dark
lager
with
minimal
head
and
a
faint
ring
smell
is
spicy
yeasty
malt
some
butter
notes
and
the
hops
are
faint
taste
is
hampered
by
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
the
spices
are
there
but
the
brew
itself
is
rather
raw
watery
and
unpleasant
despite
all
of
this
it
isnt
terrible
just
not
anything
special
350
ml
clear
bottle
golden
amber
with
slightly
off
white
head
nose
is
nothing
but
minerals
taste
is
pleasant
but
nothing
too
special
caramelly
malts
with
slightly
bitter
hoppiness
and
something
of
a
honeyed
sweet
undertone
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
the
sort
of
thing
i
look
for
in
a
winter
seasonal
mouth
feel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
and
is
mildly
carbonated
cheers
full
body
it
coats
the
tongue
you
know
youre
drinking
this
one
almost
syrupy
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
holiday
season
drinkability
dangerously
smooth
all
in
all
a
drinkable
winter
brew
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
a
samuel
smith
this
is
something
id
drink
again
sure
its
drinkable
enough
but
all
in
all
a
very
unstimulating
brew
pours
a
very
clear
copper
thin
offwhite
head
disappears
almost
immediately
a
full
imperial
pint
of
this
is
pleasing
to
look
at
nonetheless
butterscotch
aroma
soft
floral
hops
as
well
biscuity
sweet
and
earthy
the
usual
samuel
smith
buttery
notes
are
thrown
in
low
bitterness
finishes
dry
subtle
and
easy
to
quaff
i
really
expected
a
bit
more
i
felt
this
falls
short
especially
compared
with
the
other
s
s
offerings
drinkability
i
must
say
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
and
is
getting
boring
rather
quickly
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
pours
a
clean
dark
caramel
active
carbonative
produces
a
perfect
2
finger
offwhite
head
lots
of
malty
sweetness
in
nose
no
hop
presence
detected
goes
down
very
smoothly
very
sweet
and
malty
in
taste
the
maltiness
seems
to
coat
your
whole
mouth
as
you
drink
this
one
down
the
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
with
some
dry
hopiness
which
give
this
beer
a
fairly
dry
compostition
overall
a
very
delightful
pleasent
brew
a
very
nice
way
to
enjoy
the
winter
season
and
holidays
with
this
seasonal
brew
very
nice
coppery
color
good
head
and
decent
carbonation
level
low
aromasomewhat
metallic
and
slightly
skunked
flavor
is
of
malt
with
a
mellow
hop
bitterness
nice
trace
of
caramel
has
a
nice
dry
though
lingering
sweet
finish
decent
enough
body
overall
a
nice
beer
can
be
quite
lackluster
at
times
have
always
thought
it
could
use
a
slight
kick
in
the
pants
to
boost
its
overall
profile
still
a
decent
british
brew
to
look
forward
to
every
year
winter
warmer
not
sure
what
this
is
but
it
is
enjoyable
however
there
is
a
strange
aftertaste
or
lingering
bitterness
that
is
less
than
pleasant
bringing
down
the
taste
and
overall
drinkability
but
this
is
slight
this
is
a
very
satisfying
very
wellbalanced
beer
cheers
shared
the
bottle
with
a
friend
nice
light
amber
color
looks
good
tasted
as
bad
as
it
smelled
overwhelming
odor
of
vinegar
decent
thickness
but
the
more
i
sipped
the
more
the
vinegar
taste
built
up
in
my
mouth
i
could
not
drink
it
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
is
blech
an
acceptable
review
word
the
mouthfeel
could
not
be
better
thick
and
full
but
eminently
drinkable
this
is
complex
enough
to
stop
and
think
about
yet
smooth
enough
to
sessionize
and
what
a
jolly
session
that
might
be
the
consistency
of
bottle
to
bottle
is
fantastic
there
are
never
disappointments
each
sip
leaves
you
wanting
more
truly
one
of
the
finest
winter
seasonals
and
a
standout
among
a
terrific
product
line
overall
a
bit
disappointing
id
like
to
see
some
more
character
this
one
is
more
anonymous
than
id
like
taste
good
snappy
dry
finish
and
slight
warming
to
follow
ive
been
a
fan
of
samuel
smith
beers
since
my
first
encounter
and
this
one
is
no
exception
not
the
best
of
the
sam
smiths
ive
had
but
a
good
winter
beer
indeed
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
appearance
a
tea
looking
apearance
with
a
great
head
and
tremendous
lacing
one
single
fissure
of
bubbles
erupts
from
the
center
of
the
glass
pretty
cool
looking
i
always
finish
a
beer
no
matter
how
bad
but
this
one
may
take
a
while
it
pours
a
dull
amber
color
with
a
sizeable
frothy
head
that
holds
with
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
dominated
by
a
sweetness
probably
from
apples
with
some
hops
and
bitterness
that
can
be
detected
the
taste
has
some
decent
bitterness
the
flavor
really
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
it
has
some
good
thickness
but
the
carbonation
is
a
little
strong
this
is
a
good
solid
winter
ale
a
nice
looking
beer
subdued
amber
and
ruby
tones
capped
by
a
healthy
white
head
and
filled
with
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
constantly
rushing
towards
the
surface
smell
was
o
k
with
an
emphasis
and
fruity
tones
less
spicy
scent
than
many
others
in
the
type
taste
was
pleasant
if
not
outstanding
with
noticeable
alcoholic
feel
in
the
mouth
despite
a
modest
6
percent
still
maintains
a
certain
smoothness
and
drinkability
despite
the
somewhat
sharp
mouthfeel
overall
a
solid
winter
warmer
but
i
honestly
expected
a
bit
more
after
trying
sam
smiths
stouts
and
porters
which
are
top
notch
meh
i
dont
honestly
know
what
i
expected
i
mean
sammy
smith
has
always
let
me
down
in
the
past
but
but
people
always
say
its
so
good
clearly
im
missing
something
here
i
just
dont
get
it
i
mean
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
merely
unimpressive
i
mean
there
was
maybe
a
hint
of
spice
coupled
with
an
average
ale
flavour
i
guess
i
mean
whats
the
deal
this
is
just
your
run
of
the
mill
beer
granted
i
had
just
finished
a
grolsch
so
that
may
have
destroyed
my
taste
buds
hahahhahahaha
no
seriously
what
up
this
beer
has
less
flavour
than
grolsch
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
grolsch
but
it
aint
renowned
for
its
exteme
flavour
whats
up
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
ever
presented
with
the
opportunity
thats
for
sure
quite
good
this
was
a
550
ml
bottle
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
that
diminished
quickly
lacing
was
right
on
par
with
the
head
it
seemed
to
be
lightly
hopped
and
the
malt
was
caramel
sweetand
even
a
slight
hint
of
butterscotch
initiall
sweetness
finished
with
a
light
bitterness
good
balance
in
my
opinion
did
not
meet
my
idea
of
a
winter
warmer
thoughbut
still
a
pleasant
enough
brew
despite
the
risk
of
that
clear
bottle
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
overall
better
than
id
remembered
it
actually
dont
know
if
the
batch
i
got
last
year
was
a
bit
lightstruk
or
what
nothing
wrong
with
this
bottle
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
not
so
heavy
you
could
not
drink
more
not
so
alcoholic
you
would
make
an
ass
of
yourself
in
front
of
the
family
after
consuming
a
four
pack
poured
out
of
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
appears
a
reddish
orange
color
it
has
a
very
small
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
overpowering
the
taste
is
fairly
bitter
with
the
alcohol
peeping
through
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
average
this
would
not
be
on
top
of
my
list
but
is
probably
worthy
of
trying
again
sometime
smooth
mouth
with
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
balance
very
drinkable
not
spicy
like
other
winter
warmers
but
i
like
it
pours
out
to
a
clear
amber
forming
a
sticky
khaki
head
of
very
fine
meringue
bubbles
the
retention
is
excellent
carbonation
is
moderate
there
is
something
oddly
appealing
about
the
aroma
skunky
heineken
and
caramel
sweet
malt
overpowering
the
fusels
and
butterscotch
you
will
typically
smell
had
there
been
no
skunk
as
it
warms
vanilla
becomes
apparent
the
hops
blossom
with
a
minty
character
and
grainy
toasty
malt
appears
swirling
stirs
up
the
butterscotch
there
is
no
doubt
when
you
open
a
sam
smith
ale
you
can
smell
that
notorious
nose
across
the
room
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
yet
oily
with
a
medium
body
and
oxidized
soapy
finish
the
taste
is
of
course
very
english
with
plenty
of
butterscotch
but
not
overwhelming
as
the
skunk
balances
it
out
lingering
caramel
balancing
out
the
medium
strong
herbaceous
and
woodsy
bitterness
alcohol
is
imperceptable
there
is
a
semiruddy
cardboard
finish
and
aluminum
or
copper
in
the
aftertaste
this
really
isnt
a
great
beer
in
the
strict
flavor
sense
its
quite
average
by
all
marks
yet
despite
its
faults
sam
smith
of
any
type
is
intriguing
and
appealing
for
its
nostalgia
alone
which
makes
it
an
absolutely
divine
pleasure
maybe
its
the
gold
foil
maybe
its
that
unique
bottle
bottled
at
yorkshires
oldest
brewery
est1758
its
about
as
beer
as
beer
can
get
and
lazily
transports
me
to
the
seat
of
an
english
pub
in
the
early
1800s
recommended
best
enjoyed
cold
45f
as
it
gets
soapier
when
it
warms
edit
sitting
here
letting
the
beer
warm
i
have
to
say
that
the
sweetness
is
not
as
overbearing
as
i
thought
that
it
was
this
is
not
bad
brew
at
all
12
oz
bottle
from
20052006
first
ive
ever
seen
of
this
sam
smith
offering
pours
a
bright
clear
copper
with
2
fingers
of
dense
beige
head
but
not
very
good
retention
or
lacing
smell
is
very
malty
not
very
sweet
with
just
a
slight
roasted
edge
taste
is
the
malt
from
the
nose
intermingled
with
hints
of
wood
mineral
water
and
a
slight
butteriness
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
suggests
hops
but
nothing
really
comes
through
in
the
taste
mediumthin
bodied
with
fairly
low
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
i
have
pretty
limited
exposure
to
the
style
and
was
expecting
something
much
spicier
but
i
must
say
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
might
pick
up
another
pack
before
the
season
ends
drinkability
ive
got
to
say
im
dissapointed
not
a
beer
i
can
imagine
curling
up
to
fire
with
average
brew
here
all
the
way
i
would
be
happy
to
quaff
a
couple
pints
of
this
but
dont
see
myself
ever
going
out
of
the
way
to
purchase
this
again
for
a
while
this
years
rendition
is
a
subdued
eliteration
from
last
years
offering
or
my
taste
buds
are
on
holiday
nice
and
inviting
and
satisfying
to
a
point
but
not
all
that
it
could
be
taste
is
slightly
citric
with
a
sharp
hop
bite
not
a
growling
in
your
face
hop
presence
but
a
sharp
defined
existence
toasted
hops
lend
balance
to
the
equation
slightly
embittering
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
coarse
and
dry
not
a
bad
beer
that
achieves
exactly
what
it
intends
to
do
warm
your
cold
ass
on
a
winter
day
i
liked
this
beer
but
for
me
its
not
really
a
dead
of
winter
beer
more
a
cold
wet
autumn
one
i
wish
ss
would
stop
using
clear
bottles
i
was
worrying
this
would
be
skunked
pours
a
copper
color
not
much
carbonation
small
head
nice
lacing
throughout
scents
of
malt
and
slight
sweet
caramel
not
a
bad
taste
kinda
sweetbitter
medium
body
very
drinkable
why
does
samuel
smith
bottle
in
clear
bottles
is
beyond
me
not
really
sure
if
i
would
recommend
this
brew
though
i
am
guessing
this
might
have
been
skunked
from
the
other
reviews
the
clear
bottle
likely
although
i
have
never
taken
it
outside
in
the
day
even
if
skunked
this
beer
should
not
have
scored
this
low
if
it
was
good
in
the
first
place
i
strongly
suggest
that
samuel
smiths
put
this
in
a
brown
or
opaque
bottle
i
will
not
try
it
again
and
my
review
stands
since
i
definitely
didnt
skunk
it
until
they
do
i
shall
assume
this
is
simply
a
poor
quality
brew

550cl

copper
color
with
large
start
head
and
good
retention
the
bouquet
is
salty
and
sweet
with
notes
of
salted
beef
gravy
and
caramel
flavors
start
with
wholegrain
bread
then
light
toffee
and
finishing
with
a
sharp
slightly
metallic
dryness
overall
the
taste
is
slightly
thin
it
is
probably
a
good
accompaniment
to
the
savory
fruit
cakes
and
mincepies
the
british
enjoy
at
christmas
despite
the
mildly
thin
taste
the
beer
feels
very
big
and
chewy
though
the
metallic
finish
compromises
its
drinkability
a
bit
overall
an
very
good
beer
extremely
drinkable
recommended
d
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
thought
it
would
be
more
of
a
barley
wine
when
it
is
in
fact
has
more
qualities
of
a
pale
ale
interesting
beer
just
not
what
i
expected
the
carbonation
and
dry
finish
are
a
bit
over
the
top
in
my
opinion
but
i
was
really
surprised
to
have
a
beer
from
england
taste
this
yeast
driven

candied
brew
and
a
big

real
nice

but
this

still

enticing
butterscotch
spice

that

just

from
sammy
pours
a
solid

decently
color
is
lighter
for
a
winter
seasonal
rather
pale
actually
initial
smell
was
who
let
peppy
lepew
into
the
room
peppy
actually
went
away
pretty
quickly
and
what
was
left
was
an
unremarkable
hint
of
biscuity
grain
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
holiday
spice
taste
is
somewhat
complex
the
first
taste
left
a
heavy
impression
of
the
presence
of
figs
or
prunes
subsequent
sips
left
the
impression
that
there
are
a
lot
more
hops
present
than
what
your
typical
winter
beer
has
mouthfeel
is
decently
full
but
not
particularly
lively
overall
this
is
a
decent
winter
beer
but
it
is
pretty
tough
to
top
deschutes
sierra
nevada
and
widmer
bros
this
year
for
a
winter
welcome
style
of
brew
winter
welcome
is
a
strange
brew
ive
already
alluded
to
the
bottom
line
it
drinks
like
a
sweeter
less
hoppy
pale
ale
and
is
pretty
tasty
all
things
considered
i
dont
know
that
ill
buy
it
too
often
because
the
clear
glass
makes
each
purchase
a
russian
roulette
of
sorts
samuel
smith
has
brewed
a
damn
fine
beer
here
why
the
powers
that
be
insist
on
leaving
it
vulnerable
to
the
depredations
of
uv
light
is
beyond
me
pours
an
attractive
clear
amber
but
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
leaving
sparce
lacing
smells
suprisingly
similar
to
a
pilsner
strong
on
the
apples
and
kiwis
and
an
underlying
cherry
tastes
of
apples
grassy
and
citrus
hops
malty
grains
not
very
interesting
finishes
dry
lingering
bitterness
im
honestly
not
at
all
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
i
have
no
idea
what
style
it
is
but
at
the
same
time
i
like
the
way
it
tastes
will
everyone
i
doubt
it
its
definitely
not
the
syrupy
spicy
mouthful
o
malt
you
might
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
a
curiosity
butimhoa
tasty
one
20042005
this
brew
is
a
darker
brownamber
color
with
a
fairly
small
bubbly
tan
head
the
scent
has
buttery
elements
light
malt
some
fruity
tones
a
generous
caramel
malt
front
kicks
things
off
some
buttery
tones
bits
of
apple
underlying
hop
bitterness
some
spice
as
well
overall
a
good
beer
but
faced
with
other
winter
offerings
i
might
look
at
something
else
a
bit
of
buttery
feel
on
the
tongue
the
bread
flavors
seems
to
last
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
not
a
bad
drinking
brew
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
spice
or
winter
tones
not
a
bad
brew
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
ss
used
something
in
their
clear
bottles
to
prevent
oxidation
and
problems
with
light
ill
try
it
again
next
year
and
hopefully
have
better
luck
pours
a
medium
golden
with
solid
red
highlights
against
a
light
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
aroma
is
very
familiar
but
hard
to
place
something
along
the
lines
of
anise
licorice
and
peppermint
flavor
is
standard
malty
beer
with
slight
hops
bite
and
a
spicy
flavor
on
top
nice
flavor
but
this
isnt
generally
my
style
so
its
hard
to
get
my
arms
around
it
to
embrace
it

550
ml
clear
bottle
with
no
best
before
date
drinkability
this
ale
is
obviously
skunked
likely
a
result
of
its
coming
in
a
clear
bottle
i
did
not
bother
finishing
the
bottle
think
i
am
giving
up
on
sam
smith
until
the
quit
their
clear
bottle
marketing
suggest
you
try
one
but
dont
expect
too
much
poured
a
clear
caramel
bit
of
foamy
head
that
dissipated
but
left
a
slight
collar
smell
was
a
bit
skunky
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
one
cant
really
distiguish
anything
else
because
of
the
skunked
aroma
taste
was
again
skunked
upi
taste
a
bit
of
tea
this
one
must
have
been
light
struck
if
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
this
then
i
cant
really
give
it
a
good
review
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
not
good
judging
by
this
example
ill
have
to
try
this
again
this
one
always
seems
to
be
at
my
house
in
the
winter
so
ill
take
a
moment
to
write
a
review
pours
a
nice
burnt
amber
with
a
creamy
albeit
thin
white
head
which
quickly
recedes
to
provide
a
nice
lacing
smell
is
of
biscuity
malt
and
slight
notes
of
spices
taste
has
that
sam
smith
calling
card
is
it
the
fermenting
squares
spices
sweet
malts
and
bready
malts
sit
atop
of
that
distinct
sam
smith
earthiness
very
drinkable
but
i
believe
that
i
prefer
their
pale
ale
to
this
easy
intro
to
winter
seasoned
beers
20042005
edition
winter
welcome
is
amber
in
color
with
an
ample
lightly
creamy
head
the
smell
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
taste
is
subtlely
sweet
and
malty
hop
flavor
is
also
very
subtle
the
finish
has
a
nice
drying
effect
overall
id
say
this
is
a
solid
but
fairly
plain
beer
a
winter
warmer
should
be
a
little
bolder
and
bigger
i
probably
wont
be
picking
this
up
next
winter
to
me
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
worth
the
money
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
orange
reddish
color
with
just
a
lace
head
around
the
circumference
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
with
nice
hoppy
notes
the
taste
has
an
initial
sweetness
followed
by
nice
hops
and
some
very
faint
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
chewy
this
is
great
beer
for
the
winter
months
i
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
good
solid
beer
not
as
good
as
other
samuel
smiths
though
still
its
always
good
to
have
a
couple
around
the
winter
time
altogether
a
very
interesting
brew
not
the
most
drinkable
so
much
going
on
in
terms
of
the
flavor
that
one
pint
would
do
me
good
but
definitely
unique
noted
that
as
i
drank
more
the
flavor
soured
quite
a
bit
leading
me
to
lower
my
initial
scores
on
taste
and
drinkability
drinkability
this
has
always
been
on
of
my
favorites
i
love
just
about
everything
from
samuel
smith
i
will
always
have
a
few
of
these
each
holiday
season
this
beer
was
very
similar
to
the
sam
smith
india
ale
the
beer
pours
to
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
smells
of
hops
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
fruity
aroma
this
was
one
beer
that
left
me
craving
for
more
but
i
ended
up
having
to
settle
for
the
ipa
i
mentioned
above
which
will
have
to
substitute
for
the
winter
welcome
during
the
offseason
exceptional
beer
pours
a
copper
colored
with
a
off

and

slightly

toasted

tones
some
spice
mixed
with
fruit
taste
is
fully
carbonated
almost
to
a
fault

to
cut
back
on

a
tad
some
toasted

mixed
with
nuts
and
touch
of
caramel
finishes
with
touch
of
spice
nutmeg
and
hints
of
vanilla
little
hops
in
finish
also
but
mostly
spice
mouthfeel
is
too
carbonated
and
a
little
thin
drinakability
is
ok
but
nothing
to
look
for
a
little
light
in
my
opinion
for
a
winter
warmer
clear
bottle
of
the
20042005
vintage
this
brew
presents
itself
in
a
beautiful
lightcopper
color
with
a
terrific
head
firm
white
and
clumpy
the
smell
is
primarily
of
lightly
toasted
malt
with
a
woodywiny
character
and
a
touch
of
english
hops
slight
butterscotch
a
bit
of
sulfur
is
present
as
well
a
little
lightstruck
the
taste
is
fairly
dry
with
a
lightmalt
tastiness
flowing
through
its
both
nutty
and
astringent
the
beer
is
somewhat
heavily
carbonated
finish
is
dry
and
clean
with
a
moderate
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
solid
good
brew
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
yearround
pours

with
a
yellowishwhite
foamy

this
is

but
the
other
ww
i

to
try
it
poured
a
nice
coppery
clear
with
little
head
i
even
poured
down
the
middle
of
the
glass
the
initial
smell
was
kind
of
bland
and
bitter
however
the
taste
was
a
little
better
than
bland
however
still
a
little
on
the
bittersour
side
i
can
pick
out
a
small
hint
of
hops
and
a
little
caramel
i
expected
a
little
more
spice
for
a
winter
warmer
i
am
not
to
impressed
however
this
does
have
a
nice
thickfull
mouthfeel
good
thing
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
beer
is
good
happy
beering
20042005
love
the
samuel
smith
bottles
cool
shape
too
bad
theyre
clear
somebody
has
to
be
able
to
develop
a
glass
thats
cheap
and
doesnt
let
in
uv
light
hmm
off
to
make
my
fortune
light
amber
beer
about
an
inch
of
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
wasnt
crazy
about
the
smell
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
i
guess
it
needed
to
air
out
very
floral
the
hops
really
come
through
on
this
but
they
arent
offensive
at
all
just
very
dry
not
very
sweet
feels
thin
in
the
mouth
not
a
whole
lot
of
substance
ok
beer
if
you
can
get
it
fresh
nothing
really
exciting
though
middling
carbonation
creamy
consistency
saw
the
samuel
smiths
winter
welcome
announcement
in
an
ad
today
in
all
about
beer
magazine
and
thought
id
try
it
out
liked
the
updated
label
each
year
with
the
dates
of
the
winter
season
the
clear
glass
bottle
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
but
did
not
worry
about
the
skunking
process
really
beginning
to
enjoy
the
winter
warmers
but
this
is
still
not
as
good
as
sam
adams
or
averys
nice
mouthfeel
but
nothing
too
impressive
for
the
style
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
at
the
store
8
00
for
412
ounces
probably
will
try
others
instead
the
rest
of
the
season
and
pass
on
this
purchase
again
i
would
like
to
find
this
on
tap
this
winter
not
bad
at
all
drinkablity
is
fine
but
not
great
not
so
good
i
would
want
to
sit
and
drink
a
bunch
of
these
all
in
all
it
went
pretty
well
with
my
ice
cream
birthday
cake
ooh
a
delicious
beer
pours
a
lovely
transparent
amber
with
a
thich
two
finger
head
thats
sticky
as
scotch
tape
lace
sticks
around
like
foam
nice
smells
a
bit
skunked
at
first
but
that
weakened
a
bit
nice
bready
malts
herbal
hops
and
some
minerals
very
soft
scent
very
soft
taste
as
well
overall
a
soft
bready
malt
flavour
balanced
by
bitter
minerals
and
sharp
citric
and
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
dry
very
drinkable
i
like
it
very
dissapointed
dont
think
the
clear
bottle
lasted
the
trip
pours
a
nice
dark
honey
with
streaks
of
cherry
wood
the
head
is
like
whipped
cream
the
smell
was
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
almond
finish
nuts
galore
the
taste
was
very
robust
with
dry
nuts
and
a
dark
toffee
tingle
taste
seemed
dull
and
metallic
medium
bodied
pour
clear
bottle
ruined
this
one
this
is
a
really
good
ale
that
seems
like
more
of
a
bitter
than
a
winter
warmer
its
well
balanced
and
quite
robust
in
flavor
i
picked
up
550
of
this
from
my
local
beer
stop
happy
to
see
a
seasonal
or
two
at
old
harry
food
as
always
im
frightened
by
the
clear
bottle
for
good
reason
this
time
upon
opening
my
senses
were
assaulted
by
some
of
the
most
potent
skunk
ive
experienced
to
date
so
i
poured
it
and
let
it
air
out
a
bit
i
have
to
say
though
it
really
is
an
attractive
brew
crystal
clear
copper
colored
body
with
a
light
tan
head
that
is
thick
and
resilient
leaving
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
as
it
recedes
after
it
airs
out
a
bit
i
do
detect
some
sweet
malt
and
leafy
earthy
hop
underneath
the
prevailing
skunk
as
i
take
a
drink
i
pick
up
on
the
creamy
almost
buttery
malt
flavors
the
middle
presents
a
nice
robust
flat
bitterness
with
tiny
hints
of
rum
and
raison
nicely
bitter
through
the
finish
with
a
smattering
of
earthy
flavor
and
sweet
hints
of
rum
in
the
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
will
be
the
millionth
person
to
complain
about
the
packaging
this
one
pours
with
a
huge
foamy
head
and
leaves
a
nice
thick
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
off
however
a
nice
malty
buttery
smell
with
some
herby
hobs
to
compliment
but
it
also
smells
a
tad
like
metal
or
dirt
or
something
taste
is
rather
similar
not
a
lot
of
flavor
to
this
beer
in
my
opinion
i
did
drink
it
out
of
a
chilled
beer
mug
which
is
all
that
was
available
and
i
would
recommend
letting
it
warm
up
a
bit
to
let
the
flavors
come
out
a
nice
bitterness
is
this
beers
best
quality
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
this
beer
is
pretty
light
and
easy
to
drink
12
liter
clear
bottle
200405
edition
nice
looking
ale
in
the
glass
bright
orange
amber
lightly
cabonated
fair
foamy
cap
that
laces
well
aromas
of
friuts
peach
pear
and
fresh
cut
wood
caramel
malts
leafy
hops
creamy
body
well
hopped
with
the
substantial
caramel
malts
in
fair
balance
medium
finish
with
slow
but
not
over
bearing
bittering
and
some
warming
effect
a
nice
well
rounded
ale
with
no
sharp
edges
a
pleasant
drink
from
the
trepidation
inducing
clear
glass
550
ml
bottle
to
the
pint
glass
the
beer
looked
orange
clear
and
possessed
a
modest
sized
short
lived
head
the
aroma
was
slightly
spicy
along
with
perfumey
floral
scents
and
thankfully
no
skunk
the
taste
showed
typical
english
beer
restraint
and
tasted
very
balanced
there
was
a
buttery
salty
caramelized
malt
flavor
similar
to
a
hard
butterscotch
candy
the
level
of
hops
was
high
for
an
offering
from
across
the
pond
however
the
hops
were
mostly
of
the
aromatic
variety
with
low
bitterness
the
beer
was
creamy
on
the
palette
with
a
slightly
dry
aftertaste
astonishingly
drinkable
for
a
6
abv
beer
as
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
does
not
have
the
oomph
of
the
other
winter
warmers
i
can
find
off
the
shelves
but
is
a
quality
beer
nonetheless
a
pleasant
ale
but
not
much
flash
too
bland
for
me
to
have
another
pint
slightly
disappointing
one
of
my
least
favorites
from
sammy
smith
i
love
samuel
smiths
but
this
offering
was
a
slight
let
down
this
is
a
good
beer
no
question
but
at
8
99
for
a
4
pack
there
are
many
other
samuel
smiths
offerings
that
are
much
more
enjoyable
a
very
nice
beer
which
i
think
of
as
more
of
a
stronger
version
of
their
excellent
old
brewery
pale
ale
than
as
an
extra
strong
winter
beer
ive
tried
aging
it
in
the
past
and
found
that
its
best
when
fresh
this
years
bottle
art
features
carolers
as
the
theme
came
in
a
clear
bottle
that
always
worries
me
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
mostly
dies
off
leaves
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
malty
with
some
hop
notes
but
there
are
some
spices
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
well
rounded
nice
caramel
maltiness
with
a
balanced
hop
character
and
a
tiny
bit
of
spiciness
just
for
fun
could
have
a
little
more
body
but
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
nicely
hopped
with
a
sweet
caramel
background
the
flavor
is
very
caramel
with
some
sweet
hops
that
hit
towards
the
end
of
the
swallow
the
flavor
is
a
bit
thin
though
the
feel
is
just
a
light
moderate
beer
not
as
thick
as
i
would
expect
drinkability
is
high
as
this
beer
leaves
my
glass
quickly
pours
out
with
a
thick
foamy
head
a
toffycaramel
color
transparent
as
can
be
initial
smell
was
faint
of
hops
something
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
smelt
like
tasty
beer
to
me
it
tastes
balanced
but
somewhat
skunked
by
their
trakemark
clear
bottles
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
it
but
something
is
just
a
little
off
mouthfeel
is
just
about
right
for
me
smooth
but
lets
you
know
it
has
carbonation
with
tiny
bubbles
crossing
your
tongue
if
you
leave
it
there
long
enough
drinkability
is
where
most
sammy
smiths
have
their
downfall
imho
that
is
why
i
believe
they
come
in
550ml
bottles
or
4
packs
of
12oz
bottles
i
could
have
a
couple
of
pints
or
12
oz
bottles
at
the
most
of
this
stuff
at
a
time
then
move
on
to
a
taddy
porter
or
oatmeal
stout
i
wanted
to
give
this
brew
a
better
rating
although
what
i
gave
isnt
all
that
bad
because
i
enjoy
this
seasonal
offering
but
between
the
smell
and
the
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
i
couldnt
in
good
conscience
do
it
i
could
drink
a
couple
quite
nice
in
the
flavor
i
get
a
definate
malty
flavor
along
with
honey
citrus
and
a
bit
og
a
metallic
flavor
the
glass
i
am
drinking
it
from
is
a
pint
glass
i
use
for
man
beers
and
is
thouroughly
cleaned
each
time
so
i
dont
think
the
metallic
taste
comes
from
the
glass
it
is
also
a
bit
sour
in
flavor
very
colorful
label
with
a
scene
of
a
sleigh
trudging
through
deep
powder
in
the
middle
of
winter
this
is
the
20032004
version
which
pours
an
amber
brew
with
a
white
head
that
sticks
around
nicely
aroma
has
that
distinct
english
mineral
character
and
some
sweet
malts
but
no
spices
to
be
detected
taste
is
very
enjoyable
as
there
is
a
clean
herbal
hop
bitterness
balanced
with
a
slightly
sweet
malt
flavor
that
segues
into
a
clean
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
lively
as
there
is
an
average
level
of
carbonation
very
nice
ale
to
sip
by
the
fireside
in
a
cabin
during
winter
though
it
makes
a
medicore
session
beer
price
1
99
for
a
12oz
bottle
sweet
up
front
that
is
instantly
followed
by
a
nice
kick
of
herbal
hops
usually
not
a
hops
fan
but
this
is
so
well
balanced
that
i
cant
complain
small
white
head
on
this
one
malt
aroma
but
there
is
something
odd
about
it
luckluster
taste
that
leave
me
waiting
for
something
that
never
arrives
i
was
expecting
alot
more
because
of
the
style
malt
is
present
yet
far
too
subdued
sames
goes
for
the
hops
great
balance
after
taste
is
slightly
bready
heavyer
mouthfeel
than
the
taste
would
let
you
believe
drinkable
it
has
a
really
slippery
taste
similar
to
a
traditional
pale
ale
the
overall
taste
really
isnt
very
impressive
the
smell
is
pretty
off
and
that
really
takes
away
from
the
beer
overall
it
stays
fairly
drinkable
through
a
light
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
very
strong
as
well
starting
with
an
initial
maltiness
followed
by
a
carmel
and
fig
taste
it
then
surprised
me
by
finishing
with
a
slight
bite
of
hops
and
sort
of
dry
it
was
just
right
i
couldnt
detect
the
alc
even
though
its
6
abv
a
very
smooth
beer
my
second
samuel
smith
offering
second
one
today
i
might
add
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
barley
lasts
but
leaving
nice
thick
and
creamy
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
raisins
figs
other
dark
fruits
caramel
bready
biscuits
with
slight
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
maltiness
caramel
buttery
and
super
smooth
what
is
it
that
makes
english
brews
so
fing
smooth
and
drinkable
even
after
traveling
across
the
pond
there
is
a
slight
hop
kick
at
the
end
just
to
add
a
nice
bitterness
to
the
aftertaste
as
well
although
this
is
listed
as
a
winter
seasonal
i
believe
i
could
really
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
another
fine
sampling
from
samuel
smiths
even
in
the
clear
bottles
it
still
tastes
fresh
maybe
someday
ill
get
a
chance
to
sample
true
english
ale
on
tap
cask
maybe
i
was
kind
of
dreading
this
beer
i
dont
know
why
but
it
has
been
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
for
months
now
but
suprisingly
its
pretty
tasty
just
plain
smooth
malty
goodness
with
fruits
toffee
and
caramel
this
is
way
way
way
good
a
great
one
to
start
the
everning
with
a
very
very
good
standard
winter
beer
not
too
intense
in
any
way
very
clean
but
just
good
in
capital
letters
hey
sam
throw
away
the
clear
bottle
you
have
a
good
beer
here
notes
very
nice
for
the
winter
the
alcohol
taste
ruined
the
aftertaste
a
bit
though
bottle

poured
a
brown
colored
brew
with
a
medium
head
with
equally
medium
retention
aroma
of
hops
with
light
floral
and
sweet
aspect
to
it
is
quite
pleasant
taste
is
very
enjoyable
with
a
good
mix
of
hops
and
malts
a
bit
thin
on
spice
with
a
medium
body
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
would
have
appreciated
a
bit
more
hops
or
spice
to
make
it
truly
great
a
very
fine
winter
offering
and
another
reason
why
some
of
my
favorite
brews
come
from
samuel
smith
imho
this
is
a
fair
light
ale
but
does
not
seem
to
be
much
of
a
winter
warmer
i
had
a
couple
of
these
earlier
in
the
season
and
they
seemed
a
little
fresher
i
am
going
to
have
trouble
finishing
this
very
drinkable
for
the
money
though
i
would
buy
the
oatmeal
stout
i
reviewed
this
beer
one
year
ago
where
i
gave
an
overall
score
of
2
4
because
the
beer
had
skunked
obviously
this
time
around
i
am
reviewing
a
fresh
bottle
the
dramatic
rating
change
reflects
that
this
beer
truly
is
superior
when
consumed
promptly
after
the
case
is
opened
and
then
exposed
to
the
light
as
long
as
samuel
smiths
insists
on
putting
their
beer
in
clear
glass
bottles
i
shall
remain
wary
of
purchasing
it
all
i
can
say
is
ask
the
bartender
or
retail
clerk
when
the
beer
arrived
to
protect
your
purchase
seek
this
beer
out
if
it
is
fresh
ive
really
quite
enjoyed
a
number
of
other
samuel
smith
beers
but
this
one
just
isnt
quite
in
the
same
league
as
some
of
the
others
although
it
is
certainly
decent
enough
in
and
of
itself
a
copperorange
color
with
a
nice
head
and
beautiful
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
mix
of
hops
nut
and
a
citrus
or
fruityness
taste
was
a
good
blend
of
hops
and
a
smooth
nutty
taste
the
fruit
taste
makes
it
way
into
the
beer
towards
the
end
and
the
aftertaste
is
nice
flavor
of
not
too
overpowering
hops
i
liked
the
charachter
of
this
beer
and
the
way
everything
seemed
to
fit
together
a
diffeerent
winter
beer
than
im
used
to
but
nonetheless
very
good
poured
a
nice
deep
copper
colour
with
a
moderate
head
that
didnt
want
to
last
all
that
long
the
scent
was
bready
with
a
nuttiness
to
it
the
taste
was
also
very
bready
it
had
a
very
strong
pressence
of
nuts
almost
like
a
nut
brown
ale
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
there
was
a
slight
hint
of
hops
but
not
too
much
winter

a
slight
bit
more
sweet
as
the
brew
warms
this
is
an
okay
brew
but
i
dont
know
if
i
enjoyed
it
enough
to
want
more
then
one
or
two
didnt
seem
very
complex
seemed
like
a
pale
ale
that
left
me
pretty
unimpressed
it
didnt
strike
me
as
being
particularly
wintry
like
some
offerings
that
have
spices
or
higher
abvs
however
this
struck
as
the
kind
of
beer
the
macros
wished
they
could
make
itd
be
a
good
intro
to
better
beers
for
a
macro
drinker
for
sure
light
orangeyyellow
or
maybe
yellowy
orange
crisp
and
dry
in
taste
the
malt
is
understated
but
it
still
provides
a
good
balance
to
the
hop
finish
i
had
a
bottle
that
tasted
better
a
couple
months
ago
this
one
was
good
anyway
i
like
this
as
a
winter
beer
thres
nothing
remarkable
here
but
it
is
somewhat
north
of
just
ok
the
singular
offputting
quality
was
well
bested
by
mostly
full
and
diverse
characteristics
its
nice
enough
but
not
as
big
and
bold
as
you
might
expect
from
a
seasonal
winter
brew
still
if
you
get
past
the
seasonal
aspect
its
flavorful
and
enjoyable
enough
to
drink
a
few
not
matter
what
time
of
year
its
like
beer
jello
to
me
i
could
make
myself
very
sick
if
this
beer
wasnt
prohibitively
priced
lovely
it
was
just
ok
paid
2
99
for
the
pint
bottle
pours
a
peachyorange
with
a
nice
twofingered
head
aroma
seemed
a
bit
skunky
at
first
not
surprising
given
the
clear
bottling
but
also
slighly
hoppy
and
had
sweet
maltiness
fairly
smooth
but
dry
mouthfeel
sweet
maltiness
with
a
fairly
drying
hops
presence
a
little
candied
fruitiness
also
there
is
some
alcohol
present
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
dont
know
that
id
call
it
a
winter
beer
although
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
warming
feeling
still
certainly
not
a
waste
of
money
as
winter
ales
go
this
was
a
disappointment
it
is
okay
to
look
at
although
even
the
appearance
seems
weak
by
comparison
it
does
have
a
good
white
head
with
considerable
lacing
it
smells
of
hops
and
other
grains
with
some
hints
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
hoppy
blend
of
grains
but
there
is
an
acidic
undertone
that
gave
it
a
funny
feeling
in
the
mouth
it
seemed
to
be
slightly
oily
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
i
expect
more
from
a
brewer
like
samuel
smith
surprisingly
mild
samuel
smiths
brews
generally
have
much
more
character
and
texture
to
them
the
aroma
was
gentle
with
a
delicate
head
the
flavor
was
slightly
fruity
and
smooth
had
i
not
opened
the
bottle
myself
i
wouldve
been
surprised
to
learn
that
it
was
a
samuel
smith
welcoming
a
mild
winter
ive
always
loved
all
sammy
smith
brews
but
this
was
threw
me
for
a
curve
i
must
say
i
always
wanted
to
try
this
beer
because
of
the
label
on
the
bottle
many
winters
ago
i
bar
i
used
to
go
to
sold
these
at
the
cut
rate
of
3
a
bottle
the
size
of
the
bottle
and
cheap
price
seemed
to
attract
quite
a
range
of
drinkers
it
was
quite
amusing
to
see
many
miller
and
bud
drinkers
quaffing
an
english
beer
just
because
it
was
cheap
and
came
in
a
big
bottle
this
wasnt
too
bad
of
a
brew
in
my
book
it
was
a
kind
of
orangeylight
red
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
head
wasnt
spectacular
or
anything
but
stayed
around
a
little
you
could
tell
that
it
was
carbonated
though
the
smell
was
a
little
on
the
spicey
side
with
hints
of
fruits
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
but
more
along
the
spicey
side
with
hops
and
different
winter
spices
used
it
was
alittle
too
hoppy
for
me
so
ill
stick
with
my
malts
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
hops
go
for
it
pours
a
nice
dark
orange
color
nice
bit
of
head
some
lacing
don
at
the
end
however
with
what
people
have
proclaimed
of
this
beer
i
am
not
impressed
i
am
going
to
have
to
get
some
more
3
tries
thus
far
but
this
just
aint
cutting
it
has
not
very
citrushop
taste
not
very
malt
taste
just
a
general
bitter
flavor
to
it
it
didnt
smeel
mich
like
anything
and
in
all
honstly
that
prob
helped
it
i
hope
the
boys
over
at
ss
do
better
becuase
i
am
used
to
a
higher
standard
from
them
and
this
doesnt
cut
it
pale
orange
color
and
a
small
head
with
some
lacing
not
much
of
a
smell
but
some
light
buttery
notes
taste
was
straight
forward
with
good
balance
but
nothing
really
lumped
out
at
me
was
really
expecting
something
spicy
and
bold
from
a
good
brewery
like
ss
but
was
left
feeling
flat
i
will
save
the
rest
of
the
4
pack
for
my
macro
drinking
guests
who
feel
adventures
this
christmas
and
a
merry
christmas
to
all
and
to
all

very
drinkable
if
not
particularly
memorable
a
very
good
brew
from

while
not
as

as
other
winter
brews
the
winter
welcome
ale
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
entry
a
good
deal
better
on
the
warm
side
this
ale
is
not
a
flavor
monster
but
a
well
made
beer
nonetheless
wellbalanced
with
a
definite
bite
to
it
make
it

the

by

thats
a

example
of
what
holiday
beers
used
to
be
like
before
the
advent
of
more
aggressively
flavored
microbrewed
examples
became
the
norm
part
3
of
the
128
hebrew
hammer
holiday
threeway
this
may
have
well
been
the
beer
that
made
me
into
a
craft
beer
lover
the
first
great
beer
that
id
had
and
what
led
me
to
seek
out
other
beers
that
said
now
that
ive
had
plenty
of
better
beers
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
i
remember
still
ill
always
have
to
thank
sam
smith
for
leading
me
on
the
path
to
beer
redepmption
and
as
such
ill
likely
have
this
one
in
years
to
come
2004
batch
more
of
a
winter
warmer
than
last
years
malty
aroma
and
a
light
fruitiness
a
wholehearted
improvement
on
last
years
batch
which
i
recall
weighing
in
at
4
9
i
had
to
up
a
couple
of
stats
to
average
it
out
me
likey
200304
vintage
550ml
bottle
purchased
at
huckleberrys
for
2
99
poured
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
nice
sheets
of
lacing
are
left
with
each
tilt
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
pine
needles
with
the
malts
being
the
dominant
partners
the
taste
starts
out
as
sweet
maltiness
then
theres
a
piney
hoopy
taste
and
the
finish
is
pleasingly
dry
this
is
by
far
the
least
hoppy
winter
beer
ive
had
while
it
will
probably
disappoint
hopheads
i
think
the
balance
is
nice
and
makes
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
many
of
the
winter
beers
ive
had
where
the
hops
are
hugely
dominant
oelergud
the
winter
welcome
ale
poured
copper
with
lots
off
lively
carbonation
that
resulted
in
a
thick
white
head
that
was
fairly
creamy
and
retained
well
the
aroma
was
kind
of
piney
bready
alcoholic
smell
with
some
metallic
and
skunky
tones
the
taste
was
sweet
bready
malts
initially
with
a
hoppy
finish
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
but
not
nearly
as
much
flavor
as
i
would
expect
from
a
winter
brew
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangeishbrown
color
with
half
a
finger
head
there
is
a
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
good
blend
of
malt
and
hops
sweet
with
caramel
but
with
some
hop
bitterness
the
taste
is
malty
and
a
little
tart
at
first
bits
of
caramel
toffee
and
bread
in
there
a
good
dose
of
hops
on
the
finish
the
body
is
fairly
thick
and
strong
the
drinkability
is
also
fairly
good
a
pretty
nice
winter
brew
sammy
smith
creates
some
of
my
favorite
brews
especially
their
imperial
stout
i
only
tried
this
one
once
before
last
february
and
i
didnt
like
it
that
much
but
i
figured
id
give
it
another
shot
paid
3
for
the
550ml
bottle
poured
a
clear
amber
into
my
glass
with
a
white
foamy
head
it
lingered
for
a
little
bit
then
settled
with
little
lacing
smelled
sweet
and
of
roasted
malts
taste
the
same
a
sweet
ale
with
a
heavy
malt
taste
i
did
enjoy
it
more

time

not
an

i

several
of
these

i

have
to
drink
the

with

i
dont
but
it
is
a

w
a

the

is
moderately
hoppy
herbs
so
it
was
still
drinkable
i
should
have
known
better
than
to
buy
a
winter
ale
in
a
clear
bottle
in
late
march
they
should
know
better
than
to
export
a
beer
in
a
clear
bottle
my
other
qualm
with
this
beer
is
that
it
shouldnt
be
a
winter
brew
the
lightness
leaving
little
to
no

i
pick
up
the
slight

also

of
honey
malts
brown
sugars
rich
smooth
mellow
and
sweet
slight
bitterness
and
warmth
on
the
follow
through
full
bodied
medium
levels
of
carbonation
smooth
finish
overall
this
is
a
jolly
good
beer
and
ill
probably
have
a
few
more
this
holiday
i
usually
do
not
like
winter
ales
but
i
received
this
as
a
gift
and
i
really
liked
it
the
spices
really
go
well
together
to
make
this
a
great
beer
my
fav
winter
warmer
would
like
to
try
their
wee
heavy
wulver
this
beer
has
a
great
look
nose
mouth
feel
and
taste
very
well
balanced
without
any
dominating
flavor
the
finish
is
smooth
everything
a
winter
beer
should
be
this
is
everything
a
christmas
winter
warmer
should
be
its
naughty
spicy
and
nice
sweet
you
can
smell
the
spices
but
they
really
come
alive
in
the
taste
nutmeg
clove
cinnamon
gingerbread
shes
got
a
bite
but
the
malt
and
honey
sweetness
balance
it
all
out
this
is
my
new
all
time
fave
winter
warmer
better
than
gl
christmas
ale
yup
i
said
it
o
was
expecting
more
from
this
as
its
pretty
highly
regarded
in
the
winter
warmer
category
has
a
little
too
much
booze
presence
for
my
taste
and
the
spices
are
kind
of
onedimensional
o
a
good
winter
seasonal
but
a
bit
too
much
nutmeg
for
me
improved
a
little
with
warming
i
did
a
sidebyside
comparison
with
glbc
christmas
ale
this
weekend
12
dogs
was
darker
spicier
less
hoppy
the
better
christmas
ale
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
slight
bubble
to
it
minimum
head
the
smell
is
that
of
gingerbread
cinnamon
and
pinecones
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
so
if
you
like
your
christmas
beer
on
the
hoppy
side
this
one
may
not
be
for
you
the
overwhelming
taste
just
like
the
smell
is
the
gingerbread
a
touch
of
honey
lots
of
spices
present
my
palate
not
being
the
most
defined
in
the
world
tastes
cinnamon
with
a
mixture
of
other
tastes
that
i
cant
quite
pinpoint
no
matter
your
palate
though
you
cant
get
much
closer
to
a
taste
that
reminds
you
of
christmas
at
8
3
its
an
easy
drink
and
in
my
opinion
is
the
most
versatile
winter
warmer
around
drink
it
christmas
morning
as
your
family
opens
presents
enjoy
it
as
a
dessert
beer
after
a
holiday
meal
or
simply
drink
a
couple
to
yourself
as
you
watch
a
great
sports
gamemovietv
series
etc
on
a
cold
winters
day

a

thirsty
dog
brewing
company
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
25
out
5
o
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
well
spiced
and
refreshingly
lacking
in
the
hop
arena
just
malt
and
spices
with
some
slight
bitterness
to
the
aftertaste
i
am
a
fan
starts
off
ok
then
has
a
bitter
after
taste
wont
get
again
thumbs
up
the
taste
has
many
of
the
same
herbal
characteristics
with
the
added
touch
of
nutmeg
which
i
did
not
get
in
the
aroma
thin
hop
finish
overall
not
a
bad
beer
o
overall
a
decent
nose
but
way
too
much
spice
going
on
in
the
taste
for
me
not
my
favorite
holiday
beer
12
dogs
of
christmas
is
just
what
the
holidays
ordered
or
for
that
matter
anytime
i
will
have
another
o
much
better
than
most
winter
warms
ive
had
but
reader
beware
if
you
dont
want
lots
of
spice
avoid
try
one
but
if
you
can
pick
up
a
single
in
doing
so
i
would
recommend
that
o
a
very
enjoyable
spiced
beer
though
i
was
hoping
for
more
spices
especially
the
cinnamon
to
stand
out
read
on
another
beer
site
that
this
was
similar
in
formula
to
great
lakes
xmas
ale
not
even
close
pours
a
tawny
brown
with
a
tinge
of
ambera
thinner
slight
off
white
head
atop
aromas
of
nutmegmaceallspiceand
some
honey
makes
for
a
very
spiced
brew
i
like
the
warming
spiced
notes
on
the
palatecandied
ginger
and
nutmeg
notes
stand
out
most
along
with
a
sweet
honeylike
finish
the
sweetness
is
big
but
for
me
it
never
gets
overly
sticky
solid
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
dark
ruby
hue
nice
head
and
lacing
that
retains
well
brilliant
nose
of
cinnamon
ginger
and
nutmeg
spice
over
a
light
dark
malt
sweetness
with
just
a
hint
of
honey
creamy
almost
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
that
imparts
a
bit
of
effervescence
in
the
finish
the
taste
is
like
the
nose
spice
against
a
dark
malt
sweetness
base
an
exceptionally
well
balanced
brew
that
covers
the
8
3
alcohol
very
well
finishes
slowly
with
a
nice
spice
flourish
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
bite
and
a
nice
burst
of
honey
sweetness
an
outstanding
winter
offering
overall
this
is
certainly
a
winter
warmer
that
defines
the
style
great
spice
profile
and
very
smooth
body
has
the
oomph
of
a
strong
winter
beer
with
great
drinkability
overall
an
excellent
winter
warmer
that
you
should
seek
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
liked
it
a
lot
d
an
interesting
winter
warmer
lots
of
satisfying
and
redeeming
qualities
but
in
the
total
this
one
is
a
bit
less
then
the
sum
of
its
parts
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
something
subtle
that
doesnt
quite
compute
with
my
palate
perhaps
its
a
combination
of
a
bit
too
much
ginger
and
a
mouthfeel
that
is
slightly
off
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
far
from
my
favorite
winter
warmer
from
a
bottle
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
foamy
4inch
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
has
good
lacing
aromas
of
cinamon
raisin
ginger
pumpkin
spice
caramel
malt
creamy
mouthfeel
with
flavors
of
brown
sugar
caramel
cinnamon
vanilla
and
ginger
candylike
finish
of
spiced
milk
chocolate
and
a
whisper
of
honey
with
a
slight
hop
bite
this
is
better
than
many
christmas
ales
out
there
nicely
done
most
people
dont
know
this
but
this
recipe
was
brought
by
a
brewer
from
great
lakes
brewing
company
this
is
an
incredible
brew
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
christmas
ale
it
is
full
of
flavor
but
its
not
overly
filling
like
most
christmas
ales
poured
deep
brownmahogany
slight
beige
head
that
didnt
last
long
a
rich
gingerbread
aroma
some
cinnamon
in
the
nose
too
had
to
let
the
beer
warm
up
to
get
that
though
the
flavor
is
bready
with
lots
of
darker
malts
perhaps
chocolate
but
mostly
crystal
the
cinnamon
pops
up
for
a
second
but
is
quickly
diminished
very
smooth
not
shabby
i
would
like
to
age
a
couple
of
these
to
see
how
it
evolves
over
a
couple
years
i
found
this
is
at
jungle
jims
near
cincinnati
and
im
assuming
the
bottle
is
old
but
i
cant
find
a
date
this
is
an
enjoyable
winter
warmer
that
is
heavy
on
spices
but
isnt
overly
sweet
as
some
winter
warmers
tend
to
be
specifically
ginger
nutmeg
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
in
that
order
stand
out
the
smell
is
even
better
than
the
taste
the
alcohol
is
concealed
better
in
the
taste
than
maybe
any
beer
ive
ever
tried
and
that
makes
this
one
dangerous
especially
considering
how
easy
it
goes
down
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
and
the
carbonation
is
fairly
low
for
as
much
as
there
is
going
on
it
finishes
clean
overall
this
is
a
very
good
winter
warmer
that
i
would
probably
enjoy
even
more
during
the
right
season
i
cant
help
but
compare
this
to
great
lakes
christmas
ale
which
is
much
sweeter
and
a
bit
better
but
both
are
recommended
overall
better
than
most
christmas
beers
out
there
it
does
not
try
and
overpower
you
with
sweet
and
cinnamon
flavors
it
has
a
nice
offering
of
malt
taste
and
seems
to
have
good
body
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
is
an
avid
christmas
ale
drinker
o
it
is
a
solid
christmas
ale
it
has
all
the
characteristics
one
would
associate
with
christmas
a
little
past
the
season
but
it
is
still
good
taste
is
thick
malty
and
syrupy
the
sweet
cinnamon
and
spice
essence
is
most
prominent
with
this
heavybodied
rich
and
fairly
complex
holiday
ale
seems
a
bit
too
heavyhanded
for
my
taste
though
and
this
is
not
one
id
pursue
again

a
very

as

this
is
definitely
the
better
offering
vs
the
gl
version
merry
christmas
trying
the
12
dogs
of
christmas
ale
the
beer
poured
a
clear
deep
rich
amber
almost
brown
with
a
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
that
is
not
leaving
much
lace
the
scents
are
quite
nice
honey
cinnamon
giner
and
nutmeg
just
like
the
bottle
says
the
taste
starts
with
honey
for
sure
then
the
hops
and
alcohol
begin
to
add
a
bitterness
that
makes
the
taste
turn
to
pine
needles
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
subtle
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
and
winter
warmer
is
a
good
description
probably
would
not
do
more
than
one
a
night
just
alot
going
on
and
the
abv
is
buttkicking
o
still
not
exactly
sure
how
to
describe
a
christmas
ale
but
this
is
the
best
one
ive
had
yet
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
this
is
a
beer
for
the
season
and
one
that
will
certainly
put
a
smile
on
your
face
o
great
for
the
style
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
overpowering
nutmeg
flavor
but
overall
this
is
solid
o
pretty
light
lookingfeel
nice
aroma
but
a
bit
faint
very
tastysweet
overall
everything
is
good
just
a
little
faint
then
again
at
8
3
thats
really
impressive
4
for
that
got
this
dog
on
tap
poured
into
a
sniffer
it
looks
hazy
brown
with
good
head
retention
it
smells
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
a
nice
refreshing
almost
pine
smell
it
tastes
fantastic
with
notes
of
all
spice
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
throughout
each
flavor
is
distinct
but
work
so
well
together
the
mouthfeel
is
great
creamy
yet
carbonated
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
its
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
christmas
beers
around
all
i
want
for
christmas
is
12
beers
a
pouring
again
easy
drinking
throughout
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
with
some
ginger
left
on
the
palate
to
compliment
the
residual
caramel
as
expected
there
is
some
pretty
lacing
sneaky
alcohol
though
it
would
be
very
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
this
is
easily
my
favorite
offering
from
thirsty
dog
brewing
co
o
i
like
it
it
does
remind
me
of
the
holidays
high
alcohol
is
nicely
warming
you
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
something
this
spicy
but
when
you
are
this
one
is
delicious
probably
best
to
share
i
dont
think
you
would
want
too
many
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
body
smooth
feel
light
to
moderate
soft
carbonation
i
like
this
one
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
those
looking
for
a
nice
accompaniment
to
desert
or
just
a
nice
beer
for
a
cold
winter
day
do
we
even
get
those
anymore
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
orange
red
color
with
a
nice
looking
white
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
were
both
very
nice
on
this
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
subtle
spicy
note
on
the
nose
as
well
as
a
faint
orange
zest
aroma
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
as
a
nice
sweet
honey
flavor
upfront
that
settles
into
a
nice
citrusy
spicy
warming
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
and
a
little
oily
a
decent
carbonation
and
its
sticky
and
finished
dry
overall
i
though
it
was
a
really
good
brew
actually
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
chalice
the
beer
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
the
brew
smells
like
toasted
malt
nutmeg
honey
and
cinnamon
luckily
the
spice
comes
out
more
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
it
tastes
like
nutmeg
cinnamon
ginger
honey
and
toasted
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
10
99
a
6pack
not
a
favorite
in
our
camp
didnt
taste
any
spices
just
hops
and
honey
honey
overpowers
every
spice
and
flavor
tasted
to
us
like
a
typical
i
p
a
with
alot
of
honey
disappointed
o
not
a
bad
christmas
ale
this
is
an
above
average
and
i
would
like
another
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
as
expected
the
spices
were
the
main
component
but
everything
worked
together
quite
nice
i
cant
say
that
i
would
take
down
several
of
these
but
in
the
festive
spirit
of
the
seasons
i
would
no
doubt
try
this
again
its
heavy
on
the
spice
so
if
thats
not
your
thing
you
may
not
like
it
but
a
great
drink
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
bought
3
of
these
winter
warmers
this
year
and
i
think
it
was
2
too
many
theyre
a
bit
sweet
and
cloying
for
my
tastes
still
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
nice
sipper
on
a
chilly
night
dark
golden
in
color
with
a
very
light
head
even
when
pouring
into
the
middle
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
wonderful
fresh
ginger
and
nutmeg
a
great
balance
of
what
a
christmas
ale
should
taste
like
first
taste
in
malts
and
cinamon
then
comes
the
ginger
finishing
with
just
enough
kick
and
some
nutmeg
on
the
end
this
one
hits
you
on
all
sides
of
the
mouth
overall
and
great
beer
for
this
time
of
year
and
earlier
for
those
who
live
in
cleveland
this
has
become
the
new
great
lakes
christmas
all
that
we
remember
from
2008
the
great
debate
here
in
ohio
is
great
lakes
christmas
ale
or
thirsty
dog
12
days
of
christmas
i
dont
really
want
to
decide
both
are
outstanding
and
make
anyone
look
forward
to
christmas
you
cant
go
wrong
with
either
a
very
christmasy
ale
filtered
pours
out
to
a
clear
chestnut
forming
a
limpid
off
yellow
head
with
poor
retention
and
sparse
lacing
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
opens
with
some
subtle
biscuit
malt
and
toast
then
is
followed
by
an
overwhelming
spice
note
mostly
cinnamon
and
ginger
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
with
a
medium
body
taste
is
potent
with
spices
too
much
for
my
tastes
i
like
the
more
balanced
examples
of
the
style
like
great
lakes
bc
this
is
way
over
the
top
bitterness
is
mild
not
much
more
to
comment
on
here
if
you
like
strongly
spiced
beers
youll
probably
like
this
i
dont
very
dark
amber
in
appearance
nice
and
clear
smell
smell
has
a
nice
blend
of
spices
for
a
winter
warmer
mouthfeel
this
beer
tends
to
lay
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
not
anything
that
would
stop
us
from
having
one
or
two
taste
is
very
nice
and
mixed
well
for
a
winter
warmer
great
on
a
good
cold
night
we
know
had
a
few
when
it
was
19
degrees
out
overall
this
is
a
nicely
done
winter
warmer
and
one
we
feel
you
need
to
have
oh
goes
great
with
leftover
turkey
overall
this
is
exactly
what
i
would
want
when
i
think
of
a
winter
warmer
d
this
drinks
very
much
like
ohios
more
famous
winter
warmer
great
lakes
christmas
ale
this
drinks
a
little
maltier
and
has
a
more
diverse
cast
of
spices
whereas
glca
is
quite
gingery
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
winter
seasonal
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
medium
white
head
aroma
is
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
a
hint
of
clove
and
raisins
flavors
from
generous
amounts
of
toasted
and
caramel
malts
mixed
with
equally
generous
amounts
of
honey
cinnamon
ginger
and
nutmeg
medium
sticky
mouthfeel
very
nice
winter
warmer
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
christmas
ale
very
likeable
and
drinkable
a
bit
spicier
than
mostbut
thats
how
i
like
it
o
this
is
what
a
christmas
ale
should
taste
like
a
little
on
the
tart
side
but
tasty
as
can
be
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
it
has
a
lot
to
offer
in
terms
of
spices
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
want
another
the
malt
is
heavy
enough
and
the
spices
might
become
too
much
after
a
while
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
winter
warmer
that
had
a
little
different
twist
on
the
traditional
spice
profile
you
get
in
most
winter
warmers
and
they
werent
overpowering
like
some
of
them
tend
to
be
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
greatest
drinkability
i
think
the
spices
would
wear
on
me
after
more
then
one
bottle
one
of
these
is
the
perfect
amount
after
that
it
is
time
for
something
else
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
spice
profile
and
the
balance
they
were
pretty
unique
and
didnt
get
too
out
of
hand
the
alcohol
was
also
hidden
very
well
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
the
color
was
nice
but
the
head
was
pretty
lack
luster
and
was
hardy
there
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
too
keep
around
for
the
holidays
but
i
couldnt
see
buying
more
then
that
i
recommend
this
beer
to
any
winter
warmer
fan
the
spices
are
there
but
they
arent
over
the
top
this
was
another
good
beer
from
thirsty
dog
i
find
the
that
the
key
with
this
style
is
the
balance
and
thankfully
this
beer
had
the
right
amount
of
balance
another
solid
beer
from
thirsty
dog
i
like
the
slight
twist
that
they
put
on
their
beers
to
make
them
stick
out
a
little
im
down
to
try
more
of
what
these
guys
have
to
offer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
a
christmas
seasonal
i
think
its
great
overall
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
beer
im
thinking
this
is
a
winter
warmer
of
some
sort
id
happily
drink
this
one
again
this
is
pretty
tasty
sold
b
beer
just
like
80
of
every
other
beer
on
ba
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
spices
are
there
but
not
overwhelming
very
tasty
o
this
is
a
nice
christmas
ale
it
gets
compared
a
lot
to
the
great
lakes
christmas
ale
i
give
the
edge
to
great
lakes
on
this
one
but
i
dont
think
they
are
very
similar
12
dogs
is
much
more
gingerbread
and
nutmeg
forward
while
great
lakes
is
more
cinnamon
forward
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
off
white
head
and
recedes
to
a
fine
layer
aromas
of
brown
sugar
like
malt
gingerbread
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
in
the
taste
more
of
the
same
cinnamon
some
nutmeg
sugary
malt
faint
date
notes
as
well
warming
alcohol
is
felt
but
absent
in
the
taste
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
spice
overall
a
fine
sipper
and
a
good
example
of
a
winter
warmer
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
winter
ale
i
was
given
a
few
bottles
for
free
waited
until
the
ground
was
snow
covered
to
bust
one
out
glad
i
got
to
try
this
might
pick
up
a
couple
of
bottles
every
year
pours
a
clear
reddish
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
tannish
head
which
gives
way
to
skim
and
leaves
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
nutmeg
cinnomon
and
clove
the
taste
follows
suit
there
is
a
big
nutmeg
and
cinnomon
flavor
it
is
nice
but
not
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
is
solid
a
good
beer
for
the
class
but
not
the
best
body
is
light
and
the
alcohol
is
lost
in
the
spices
just
like
christmas
ale
it
catches
up
to
you
at
8

ohio
knows
its
spiced
winter
beers
o
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
is
definitely
wildly
uneven
if
you
are
a
fan
of
gl
christmas
ale
you
will
probably
like
this
beer
a
bit
but
in
my
opinion
its
not
as
complex
nor
as
good
just
too
much
clove
for
my
taste
the
taste
was
a
very
strong
mixture
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
nut
meg
not
only
were
there
many
flavors
but
it
was
a
crisp
the
alcohol
did
not
really
linger
in
my
mouth
for
too
long
poured
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
nice
looking
beer
dark
brown
with
a
silky
head
nose
has
malts
and
some
spices
as
well
what
i
like
about
this
winter
warmer
is
that
it
show
cases
the
malts
rather
than
the
spices
not
overly
spiced
that
is
my
dear
boy
nice
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
to
boot
dark
amber
in
color
with
white
head
that
develops
a
mist
over
top
aroma
of
cinnamon
spices
caramel
and
slight
apple
tastes
of
apple
skins
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
then
booze
comes
in
and
slicks
the
palate
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
boozy
winter
warmer
overall
i
liked
it
a
lot
this
beer
and
gl
christmas
ale
are
often
compared
to
one
another
if
you
desire
a
sweeter
christmas
ale
go
gl
if
you
want
a
little
bit
more
malty
and
bitter
one
then
this
one
is
for
you
both
a
fine
in
their
own
right
solid
winter
warmer
here
4
0
d
really
nice
example
of
what
this
style
can
offer
i
love
ginger
and
this
one
delivers
plenty
of
it
highly
recommended
overall
drinkability
i
remember
hearing
that
this
beer
was
created
by
someone
involved
in
inventing
the
original
great
lakes
christmas
ale
and
this
one
was
a
copy
of
the
original
with
some
extras
spices
thrown
in
i
had
the
gl
chirstmas
ale
again
night
and
after
that
tasting
last
night
i
can
say
that
the
two
beers
are
quite
different
this
one
is
much
sweeter
has
a
bit
more
boozy
flavor
to
it
that
is
quite
noticeable
and
the
ginger
in
the
great
lakes
makes
it
quite
different
than
this
one
interestingly
both
seem
to
have
a
tealike
bitter
finish
same
hops
so
now
that
im
done
comparing
the
two
what
do
i
think
definitely
a
winter
warmer
but
im
not
crazy
about
the
solventy
notes
i
get
through
the
whole
drink
even
after
it
warmed
up
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
are
a
nice
touch
and
it
definitely
warmed
me
up
this
evening
so
this
is
a
winter
warmer
just
not
a
great
one
in
my
opinion
something
about
that
solvent
smell
and
taste
im
not
really
enjoying
i
guess
but
otherwise
an
interesting
one
to
try
o
this
is
one
of
only
a
few
winter
warmers
ive
tried
its
really
a
darn
good
beer
and
should
be
tried
if
you
have
access
to
it
well
priced
at
10
99
a
sixer
for
a
imperialesque
beer
ill
probably
snag
another
six
this
holiday
season
another
solid
one
from
thirsty
dog
o
tasty
nice
to
sit
by
the
fire
and
sip
medium
to
full
bodied
its
a
little
thicker
than
expected
this
was
a
surprise
but
a
pleasant
one
the
carbonation
isnt
really
there
but
thats
not
a
problem
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mediumbodied
i
remember
complaining
about
a
slightly
metallic
taste
last
year
thankfully
that
seems
to
be
missing
from
this
years
tasting
a
good
amount
of
spice
a
good
brew
from
thirsty
dog
but
not
my
favorite
holiday
brew
o
i
think
i
will
buy
it
again
it
should
be
noted
that
this
beer
competes
directly
with
columbus
brewing
company
winter
warmer
and
great
lakes
christmas
ale
in
columbus
it
will
be
a
close
call
between
this
beer
and
columbus
winter
warmer
o
pretty
good
overall
nothing
truly
special
but
good
o
i
really
like
this
beer
a
great
christmas
ale
the
spices
are
exceptional
onot
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
not
very
good
to
me
again
maybe
just
a
bad
bottle
ill
need
a
fresh
one
but
thats
hard
since
they
dont
date
the
bottles
great
xmas
ale
slight
notes
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
and
honey
make
this
taste
like
christmas
is
right
around
the
corner
8
doesnt
hurt
either
i
do
not
think
it
is
as
good
as
the
2009
batch
as
for
the
2010
batch
there
is
no
comparison
this
years
batch
is
excellent
tasted
the
b
a
12
dogs
at
blues
and
brews
amazing
hopefully
the
akron
area
will
see
a
couple
of
those
kegs
this
winter
overall
i
really
need
to
try
this
fresh
since
something
just
isnt
clicking
maybe
the
toasted
malt
hops
or
ginger
but
i
feel
it
would
taste
better
fresh
very
hard
to
tell
though
since
they
dont
date
their
bottles
good
xmas
ale
a
quick
up
and
comer
in
my
experience
great
look
and
smell
very
sweet
and
cinnimiiny
smell
warms
you
up
quick
gives
your
lips
a
bit
of
a
tingle
goes
great
with
sweets
including
xmas
cookies
or
something
more
on
the
saltier
side
every
year
i
find
i
am
having
more
of
a
craving
for
12
dogs
than
great
lakes
red
brown
with
a
big
cream
colored
head
that
was
thick
and
long
lasting
smelled
deeply
of
malt
and
spices
nutmeg
and
almost
a
cinnamon
taste
was
a
little
thin
the
spiceness
was
definatly
there
and
actually
felt
a
bit
warm
going
down
great
mouthfeel
as
the
carbonation
was
pretty
much
perfect
very
very
drinkable
o
while
i
am
indeed
looking
forward
to
fall
seasonals
pumking
and
the
like
i
cant
but
help
to
gaze
slightly
further
in
the
coming
seasons
and
await
these
winter
warmers
with
surmounting
anticipation
beer
tastes
a
little
like
tree
sap
pine
needles
with
nutmeg
the
pine
is
quite
forward
throughout
the
beer
interesting
if
this
were
labeled
ipa
nad
tasted
like
resin
i
may
even
like
it
but
this
isnt
hoppy
it
tastes
like
spruce
extract
almost
interesting
i
suppose
but
not
a
repeat
for
me
pours
a
dark
amberbronze
color
with
a
pretty
good
white
head
and
a
nice
collar
throughout
some
spotty
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
light
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
has
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
as
well
but
with
the
addition
of
a
good
amount
of
pine
medium
body
and
a
really
dry
finish
decent
enough
but
not
something
id
go
back
to
overall
a
pretty
good
christmas
beer
but
nowhere
near
one
of
the
best
a
benchmark
winter
warmer
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
made
better
if
it
is
cold
outside
although
this
beers
flavor
would
seem
better
suited
for
fall
than
winter
md
somewhat
light
on
the
tongue
after
such
a
strong
spicy
smell
i
was
slightly
cautious
of
this
beer
however
i
found
it
to
be
rather
drinkable
especially
8
the
almost
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
accentuate
the
spices
of
the
beer
and
really
bring
it
together
honestly
i
am
disappointed
that
i
did
not
get
this
when
christmas
time
was
around
it
would
have
gone
great
during
christmas
eve
and
i
definitely
could
have
finished
a
six
pack
of
this
impressive
beer
probably
my
favorite
winter
warmer
of
the
season
granted
the
recency
effect
does
play
a
role
d
yummy
seasonal
brew
that
blends
the
malts
and
spices
in
a
very
attractive
way
an
evening
with
several
of
these
would
be
quite
enjoyable
this
is
the
gl
christmas
ales
big
brother
as
good
as
the
gl
is
this
shouldnt
be
overlooked
its
every
bit
as
good
i
liked
this
but
i
dont
see
why
people
love
gl
christmas
ale
so
much
more
than
it
12
dogs
of
christmas
is
almost
the
same
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
pours
a
mahogany
red
with
little
offwhite
head
nose
is
of
spices
with
some
sweet
malt
thrown
in
taste
follows
with
spices
sweet
malt
bill
and
more
spices
maybe
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
on
the
finish
tastes
like
gl
christmas
but
maybe
a
bit
more
refined
decent
mouthfeel
medium
ample
carbonation
decent
drink
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
am
a
bit
tired
of
all
the
christmas
beers
by
now
pours
a
clean
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
few
honey
like
notes
in
the
taste
spicy
cinnamon
primarily
and
some
hints
of
clove
like
honey
a
spice
bite
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
cinnamon
in
the
aftertaste
kind
of
average
big
cinnamon
hints
of
honey
but
it
does
hide
the
alcohol
d
overall
this
is
i
think
the
best
christmas
ale
i
have
had
extremely
drinkable
and
my
mouth
hit
the
floor
when
i
saw
this
was
8
3
alcohol
drinks
like
a
56
beauty
will
buy
again
and
that
alone
says
a
lot
for
myself
this
beer
gets
compared
to
gl
christmas
ale
alot
alot
of
similarites
thirsty
dogs
is
more
of
a
dessert
beer
if
you
will
christmas
in
a
bottle
perfect
for
the
holidays
recommened
d
at
first
i
thought
this
was
really
going
to
be
a
one
and
done
i
even
noted
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
spread
a
sixpack
over
the
season
however
it
kind
of
grew
on
me
by
the
end
its
a
good
holiday
nightcap
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
drink
it
again
when
im
looking
for
a
spicy
holiday
brew
pours
into
a
brownish
red
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
it
has
decent
carbonation
pretty
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
and
cloves
when
tasting
it
i
get
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
little
bit
of
honey
followed
by
some
cloves
and
malts
with
a
gingery
after
taste
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
can
hardly
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
it
has
a
nice
smooth
feel
to
it
that
leaves
a
dry
chalky
feeling
with
some
tart
bitterness
in
the
mouth
and
it
is
quite
drinkable
for
being
on
the
dry
side
i
think
that
this
may
be
the
beginning
of
a
new
annual
xmas
drink
for
me
merry
xmas
to
all
at
beer
advocate
even
though
i
said
it
a
day
late
the
tastes
all
go
together
well
and
this
is
easy
to
drink
maybe
a
little
too
easy
for
something
so
high
in
alcohol
8

definitely
festive
warms
the
tummy
but
not
my
favorite
winter
ale
d
goes
down
too
easy
for
a
beer
over
8
abv
poured
into
a
tall
glass
it
appears
a
lighter
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
on
an
aggressive
pour
i
smell
a
faint
cherry
smell
with
a
high
malt
smell
it
goes
down
like
a
lager
but
finishes
like
the
ale
it
is
taste
is
a
nice
sweet
malt
taste
with
a
hint
of
cherrys
as
well
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
it
has
little
to
no
bitter
finish
all
and
all
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
enjoy
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
not
that
any
of
the
categories
we
rate
on
were
a
huge
winner
but
the
fact
that
this
brew
had
something
different
about
it
it
was
very
wasy
to
drink
despite
the
higher
abv
that
its
carries
this
brew
was
nice
and
sweet
and
gives
a
nice
warming
feel
without
the
heavy
alcohol
burn
great
representation
of
the
style
thirsty
dog
did
a
nice
job
with
12
dogs
of
christmas
its
a
pretty
solid
winter
warmer
thats
unique
in
that
the
spices
linger
in
the
background
rather
than
hog
the
spotlight
if
youre
somewhat
spice
averse
and
like
malty
beer
12
dogs
should
be
right
up
your
alley
its
not
a
great
holiday
release
but
its
pretty
darn
good
can
not
tell
that
this
is
8
5
abv
this
one
could
get
you
in
trouble
very
quaffable
and
zero
aftertaste
t
a
pretty
bold
but
smooth
taste
definite
cherry
taste
d
a
unique
beer
that
may
rival
any
of
the
anchor
christmas
ales
i
have
tried
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
worth
trying
had
this
as
a
comparison
of
christmas

with
some

that

aroma
was
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
taste
was
very
similar
with
a
warming
mouthfeel
that
was
medium
very
good
winter
warmer
that
i
thought
gave
great
lakes
a
run
for
the
money
overall
a
very
nice
christmas
beer
that
has
all
the
keyfeatured
spices
of
the
season
present
and
accounted
for
i
personally
would
have
liked
to
have
tasted
a
bit
more
honey
and
smidge
less
cinnamon
but
thats
splitting
hairs
reminds
me
of
a
darker
rounder
and
creamier
version
of
great
lakes
christmas
ale
which
is
saying
alot
in
my
book
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
drinkability
would
lend
itself
to
one
a
night
in
the
right
company
of
the
holiday
season
fireplaces
and
whatnot
d
good
drinkability
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
one
d
was
really
happy
with
this
beer
keeps
tasting
better
better
as
you
go
on
not
to
mention
it
has
8
3
abv
but
its
not
overpowering
you
could
easily
drink
to
many
of
these
excellent
winter
warmer
highly
recommended
not
nearly
as
good
as
great
lakes
version
this
still
does
the
job
and
could
be
had
in
greater
quantities
before
succumbing
to
cinnamon
fatigue
some
holiday
ales
can
get
out
of
control
worth
a
try
for
sure
d
one
drink
leads
to
another
and
they
keep
tasting
better
nice
to
cellar
and
store
for
a
while
mine
was
a
good
8
months
old
and
the

is
not
overpowering
but
offers
a
great

could

just
a
classic

blended

traditional

very
smoothly
blended
very
much
a
holiday
hit
not
to
be
missed
okay
quick
recap
very
nice
especially
for
a
winter
warmer
lots
of
spices
very
warming
with
a
fairly
full
mouthfeel
worth
seeking
out
especially
at
this
time
of
year
a
pretty
damn
amazing
winter
warmer
impressive
is
the
first
word
that
comes
to
mind
complex
yet
dangerously
drinkable
as
well
drinkability
woof
one
to
try
provided
youre
a
fan
of
the
spiced
brews
though
of
the
spice
beers
i
encountered
this
winter
i
still
think
lakefronts
holiday
spice
lager
beer
much
to
my
surprise
was
my
favorite
not
a
great
winter
warmer
but
not
a
bad
one
certainly
anything
8
3
can
be
warming
but
this
one
does
add
a
good
use
of
spice
i
am
still
puzzled
over
the
lack
of
honey
i
just
dont
see
that
it
added
anything
to
this
beer
certainly
a
one
and
done
beer
drinkability
the
beer
itself
reminds
me
in
some
ways
to
other
seasonal
beers
especially
the
pumpkin
ones
the
spices
are
not
too
overpowering
and
really
nice
however
as
is
the
case
with
most
seasonal
beers
i
feel
its
a
session
beer
one
is
good
two
at
the
most
overall
really
nice
beer
though
thirsty
dog
has
added
another
impressive
beer
to
their
lineup
not
the
best
christmas
ale
but
easily
in
the
top

hard
to
beat

the
quickly
dissipated
into
a
sudsy

mild

some
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
perhaps
a
dash
of
allspice
not
quite
pumpkin
spice
but
well
on
the
road
taste
consistent
with
nose
your
classic
winter
warmer
but
not
as
cloying
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
and
lively
very
respectable
for
a
winter
warmer
not
a
style
i
usually
grab
for
but
the
subtleties
and
the
wellhidden
alcohol
makes
for
an
enjoyable
seasonal
d
a
basically
good
beer
to
have
around
for
the
holidays
not
too
shabby
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
would
rather
grab
another
than
this
one
in
the
style
enjoyable
enough
final
thought
solid
seasonal
from
a
very
solid
brewery
nice
christmas
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
a
lot
of
spice
all
in
all
this
brew
surprised
me
i
didnt
expect
it
too
be
as
smooth
and
refreshing
as
it
is
this
is
a
great
brew
to
have
after
a
nice
long
winter
day
at
work
not
too
heavy
or
too
light
and
very
refreshing
have
this
if
you
like
the
hoppiness
to
be
masked
some
by
flavor
the
drink
is
a
tad
lighter
in
body
than
my
ideal
winter
warmer
would
have
but
that
factor
coupled
with
mild
carbonation
enhance
the
drinkability
score
quite
a
bit
the
essential
internal
warming
element
is
not
in
doubt
at
all
drinakbility
is
much
better
than
the
average
spiced
xmas
beer
but
is
still
second
to
great
lakes
overall
this
is
a
very
good
holiday
beerwinter
warmer
its
up
there
in
alcohol
content
but
that
doesnt
really
overpower
in
the
flavor
the
aroma
is
good
and
much
of
that
is
tasted
in
the
flavor
one
of
the
best
ive
had
so
far
this
season
dit
is
an
ok
beer
that
doesnt
show
the
high
alcohol
so
it
is
drinkable
but
it
is
average
imo
medium
body
good
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
well
very
enjoyable

a
murky
light

with
a
decent
offwhite

the
taste
is
burnt
caramel
malts
in

with
a
slight
alcohol
presence
and
mild
cinnamon
and
spice
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
more
boozy
alcohol
than
id
prefer
but
not
too
overbearing
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
not
one
id
likely
try
again
drinkability
would
be
great
for
a
cool
winter
night
probably
my
second
favorite
winter
warmerchristmas
ale
right
behind
great
lakes
not
really
a
sessionable
beer
but
i
would
definitely
get
through
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
d
easy
drinking
the
fact
that
this
is
8
3
is
pretty
impressive
it
drinks
in
every
way
like
a
4
5
slightly
spiced
winter
warmer
i
dont
love
this
one
but
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
and
amazingly
deceptive
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
some
carbonation
a
nice
example
of
a
spicy
holiday
brew
the
right
amount
of
spice
can
really
add
to
the
taste
experience
but
over
spicing
may
often
detract
imo
the
12
dogs
of
christmas
is
over
spiced
drinkability
is
also
very
good
on
a
cold
ohio
night
with
snow
coming
down
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
have
one
of
the
12
dogs
of
christmas
your
night
will
be
improved
markedly
highly
recommended
as
good
or
better
than
glbc
christmas
ale
imo
priced
about
the
same
in
ne
oh
go
for
this
one

you
have

as

with

going
on

not
from

thirsty

12
dogs
of
christmas
ale
isnt
as
good
as
great

christmas
ale
but
its
a
pretty
good
effort
all
the
same
if
i
still
lived
in
the
buckeye
state
id
probably
buy
a
sixer
of
this
and
two
sixers
of
gls
version
every
december
definitely
worth
a
look
sounds
a
bit
harsh
but
most
winter
warmers
fall
into
this
overlysweet
artificiallyspiced
catagories
the
beer
is
par
of
the
course
and
delightful
when
in
the
mood
for
heavy
sweetness
and
varying
spices
eric
overall
12
dogs
of
christmas
ale
presents
the
seasonal
category
well
but
also
is
versatile
to
be
sipped
on
any
occasion
pleasant
aroma
some
dissipitating
white
cloudy

on
cloudy
yellow

mouthfeel
is
a

above

although
tingling
from

though
it
was
not
apparent
or
obtrusive
honey
and
some
spices
nothing
too
much
spice
and
lagerish
taste
really
pleasant
it
was
ok
winter
beers
have
to
come
with
something
special
especially
because
of
whats
available
this
one
didnt
cut
it
as
a
side
note
for
as
sweet
as
it
was
i
really
wish
there
was
more
to
the
nose
drinkability
a
solid
if
slightly
overlyspiced
winter
warmer
the
constituent
parts
are
good
just
out
of
balance
cut
the
ginger
back
a
few
notches
and
youd
have
a
really
good
beer
perhaps
not
quite
sessionable
at
8

but
a
good
infrontofthefire
christmastime
sorta
beer
drinkability
was
good
light
on
the
abv
nice
and
tasty
although
i
would
not
drink
more
than
one
or
two
fo
these
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
certainly
not
a
replacement
for
either
great
lakes
or
barleys
christmas
ales
the
three
are
similiar
the
thing
that
makes
this
one
different
is
the
nutmeg
and
the
booziness
of
the
brew
if
youre
into
either
one
of
those
features
then
by
all
means
go
for
this
brew
otherwise
its
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
that
id
buy
year
after
year
poured

i

d
8

look
out
there
is
no
hint
of
the
gravity
here
and
it
certainly
catches
up
to
you
i
can
certainly
see
myself
going
through
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
cant
wait
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
6
d
this
beer
isnt
bad
for
a
christmas
beer
but
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
cant
get
that
pine
taste
out
yea
too
much
pine
good
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
balanced
spicing
with
a
warming
alcohol
sensation
in
the
swallow
out
of
a
mixed
6pack
from
liberty
st
tavern
yeah
the
spices
are
heavy
but
paired
with
a
god
christmas
cookie
its
quite
tasty
theres
a
overwhelming
presence
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
ginger
over
a
sweet
caramel
roll
malt
profile
and
mellow
but
spicy
hops
finish
theres
no
hint
of
alcohol
and
if
you
dont
mind
the
spice
this
is
a
tasty
winter
treat
d
again
not
a
fan
of
eastern
baking
spice
in
beer
but
in
the
eastern
spiced
winter
warmer
category
it
fares
about
the
same
as
its
butt
buddy
just
balanced
in
a
differrent
way
tried
it
on
tap
and
boy
was
it
delicious
the
smell
was
very
inviting
and
so
the
moment
i
got
my
nose
right
down
in
there
i
knew
this
one
was
going
to
be
good
although
i
think
some
of
the
spices
could
of
been
toned
down
a
bit
it
didnt
bother
me
much
and
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
all
the
way
through
i
have
heard
rumors
that
the
12
dogs
recipe
is
the
old
great
lakes
christmas
ale
recipe
before
they
made
some
alterations
not
sure
if
its
true
but
this
one
is
definitely
worth
trying
just
like
the
harpoon
winter
warmer
this
beer
is
awful
its
like
drinking
a
liquid
christmas
tree
the
piney
taste
and
over
spiced
taste
makes
this
brew
hard
to
swallow
the
smell
is
actualy
not
that
bad
but
it
is
the
calm
before
the
storm
not
impressed
at
all
appears
a
dark
chestnut
brown
hue
with
a
large
off
white
khaki
head
with
fine
intricate
lacing
between
each
sip
retention
is
decent
aroma
offers
up
a
nice
mix
of
christmas
spices
according
to
the
label
it
says
honey
cinnamon
ginger
and
nutmeg
what
stands
out
to
me
is
the
spicy
ginger
along
with
earthy
and
pine
hops
of
course
a
strong
honey
sweetness
rides
in
the
sidecar
very
complex
and
full
of
christmas
senses
supposedly
the
same
recipe
as
the
great
lakes
christmas
ale
according
to
a
recent
thread
rumor
im
not
sure
but
it
smells
pretty
close
flavor
is
nice
spices
play
nice
with
bitter
and
spicy
edges
im
getting
christmas
spiced
bread
with
powdered
yeast
drizzled
with
honey
and
caramel
lets
not
forget
spruce
tips
and
a
raw
earthy
bitterness
with
just
a
touch
of
booziness
about
it
i
cant
believe
this
brew
is
scoring
in
the
middle
of
the
road
category
because
its
fantastic
im
ready
for
a
whole
sixer
better
yet
a
mixed
sixer
half
great
lakes
christmas
ale
and
half
of
this
fine
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fuller
bodied
with
some
thicker
textures
joining
the
party
some
honey
and
some
rough
spice
induced
bitterness
in
the
finish
also
some
soothing
alcohol
burn
that
makes
the
whole
experience
work
a
little
better
and
drinkability
wise
its
pretty
easy
to
drain
a
12
ounce
pour
if
you
let
your
palate
adjust
to
the
honey
and
spices
throw
a
cigar
into
the
mix
and
it
will
hold
up
equally
as
well
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
34
inch
head
good
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
it
the
taste
is
everything
listed
onthe
bottle
this
beer
tastes
like
christmas
it
is
similar
to
great
lakes
christmas
ale
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
in
the
background
honey
and
ginger
it
is
too
high
in
alcohol
to
be
a
session
beer
but
the
alcohol
is
hidden
behind
those
spices
i
like
old
leghumper
from
thirsty
dog
and
now
this
one
it
might
be
time
to
revisit
their
beers
so
today
i
try
12
dogs
for
the
first
time
and
also
find
out
that
they
are
local
i
generally
like
spiced
ales
a
lot
i
like
everthing
ive
had
a
lot
of
great
lakes
christmas
ale
already
this
season
it
is
outstanding
12
dogs
tastes
very
similar
to
the
great
lakes
to
me
i
will
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
taste
test
some
day
the
thirsty
dog
has
more
spice
and
not
as
creamy
a
finish
i
wonder
what
it
is
like
on
tap
it
would
be
great
if
it
were
a
little
stronger
really
strong
then
all
that
spice
could
be
hiding
12
alcohol
pours
a
relatively
clear
darker
shade
of
amber
with
minimal
head
not
much
lacing
to
mention
smells
very
strongly
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
allspice
smells
of
relatively
nothing
but
holidaylike
spices
and
very
strongly
taste
is
much
the
same
strong
nutmeg
ginger
cinnamon
allspice
subtle
hop
spice
malty
decent
carbonation
medium
bodied
very
sweet
and
spicy
one
bottle
is
enough
not
totaly
impressed
pours
a
kinda
thin
head
that
goes
down
quickly
no
lacing
scents
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
vanilla
bristle
through
tastes
very
much
as
to
what
it
smells
like
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
with
nice
spices
not
a
beer
you
can
guzzle
but
nice
to
have
one
around
the
fireplace
deceptively
strong
beware
and
be
careful
true
to
the
style
of
this
spicey
beer
jonathan
passow
i
am
drinking
this
the
same
month
as
its
best
by
date
it
has
an
earthy
spicy
hop
nose
and
some
cardamom
to
cola
it
pours
brilliant
burn
amber
to
garnet
under
an
offwhite
foam
cap
the
palate
starts
creamy
and
malty
and
then
there
a
little
tanginess
arises
followed
by
some
smooth
malt
flavors
that
fade
as
it
dries
out
in
the
finish
and
lingers
with
a
mingling
of
malty
and
bitter
after
tastes
with
just
a
touch
of
pepper
a
hint
of
heat
very
faint
roast
medium
body
and
medium
to
a
shade
less
on
the
carbonation
o
this
was
a
pretty
simple
noncomplex
beer
with
subtle
aromas
and
nondominant
flavors
it
really
didnt
seem
the
winter
warmer
but
more
of
a
weak
aipa
easy
drinkong
the
sentiment
sucks
never
summer
its
how
it
feels
even
as
we
get
our
first
thaw
in
two
months
lake
erie
is
an
ice
block
and
i
am
not
going
to
the
caribbean
again
until
next
month
at
least
we
have
great
beers
like
this
to
keep
us
warm
a
decent
winter
warmer
not
sure
ive
had
much
from
this
brewery
but
this
isnt
that
bad
for
a
first
impression
having
it
for
dessert
what
i
want
to
say
about
this
beer
is
that
its
very
much
like
jubelale
by
deschutes
if
you
like
that
beer
youll
like
this
one
overall
an
alight
brew
overall
but
nothing
super
exceptional
and
one
i
think
would
actually
have
been
better
on
traditional
tap
not
nitro
good
beer
appropriate
to
the
style
malt
is
sticky
and
complex
the
touches
of
alcohol
in
a
sessionable
ale
really
make
this
feel
true
to
the
season
i
want
another
and
then
curl
up
on
the
couch
in
front
of
a
fireplace
a
very
pleasant
surprise
overall
very
drinkable
with
strong
and
complex
flavors
it
is
15
degrees
in
nj
today
and
this
beer
is
hitting
the
spot
at
lunchtime
the
beer
pours
a
clear
rubyred
color
and
a
thin
offwhite
head
sits
atop
the
brew
but
dissipates
rather
quickly
bready
and
caramel
malt
aromas
start
things
off
before
moving
to
a
pleasant
citrus
hopkick
caramel
malt
and
spice
begin
to
warm
the
palate
before
a
biting
hoptwang
balances
everything
out
the
spices
throughout
the
tasting
really
add
an
intriguing
dimension
to
this
mediumbodied
moderately
carbonated
brew
never
summer
isnt
the
type
of
beer
i
expected
it
to
be
but
it
is
still
a
good
brew
overall
i
was
looking
for
a
maltier
spicier
taste
but
this
beer
is
still
good
in
its
own
way
it
cannot
substitute
for
the
more
traditional
winter
ales
in
taste
but
it
is
actually
a
good
tasty
beer
in
its
own
way
it
could
be
consumed
during
any
season
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
are
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
or
a
good
winter
beer
not
available
to
me
locally
on
the
east
coast
like
most
colorado
beers
but
i
enjoyed
it
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
good
malts
and
spices
not
enough
alcohol
to
characterize
a
warmer
might
be
best
shelved
among
english
milds
very
similar
to
mild
winter
by
goose
island
although
not
as
good
still
a
worthy
order
ondraft
or
as
a
single
purchased
among
a
mixsix
or
in
my
situation
as
part
of
a
mixed
xmas
case
cheers
nice
winter
seasonal
shared
a
pint
with
a
friend
at
gainesville
house
of
beer
this
one
pours
reddish
brown
with
very
little
head
aroma
is
pine
hops
that
are
mostly
subdued
by
heavy
mlats
lots
of
hop
flavor
without
bitterness
aggressive
biscuit
and
toffee
malts
take
this
over
a
good
bit
warming
with
a
clean
finish
wont
seek
it
out
but
nice
to
try
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
not
one
id
return
to
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
a
chilly
night
it
doesnt
really
provide
any
heat
from
the
alcohol
but
the
malty
nature
of
this
beer
helps
to
warm
you
up
from
the
inside
overall
this
is
an
average
winter
warmer
at
best
something
just
doesnt
gel
here
with
the
darker
malts
and
earthy
rustic
almost
herbaceous
hops
one
and
done
for
me
here
i
like
my
winter
warmers
much
more
balanced
and
less
americanized
if
you
catch
my
drift
pours
out
a
nice
ruby
color
but
there
is
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
on
this
beer
i
can
smell
the
caramel
malts
immediately
and
get
hints
of
the
hop
aroma
it
has
a
nice
warm
character
to
it
which
i
like
it
is
balanced
well
with
the
hops
and
i
detect
a
little
bit
of
nutmeg
it
really
brings
me
back
to
winter
months
but
unfortunately
it
just
tastes
kinda
average
im
not
sure
if
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
but
if
you
like
winter
warmers
it
is
worth
a
shot
very
unique
the
cardamom
is
a
loveitorhateit
affair
but
im
digging
it
i
dont
normally
like
winter
warmers
but
i
could
get
into
this
brew
this
is
a
good
beer
but
rather
run
of
the
mill
for
a
winter
warmer
its
your
typical
over
spiced
ale
but
rather
a
more
simple
malty
ale
that
in
some
respects
resembles
an
amber
ale
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
representative
for
the
style
not
quite
the
warming
spicy
malt
bomb
i
was
looking
for
if
this
was
the
only
winter
warmer
available
to
me
i
certainly
would
drink
it
but
with
other
options
out
there
i
think
i
may
reach
for
another
o
this
is
the
best
beer
i
received
in
the
first
month
of
the
amazing
beer
club
collection
i
love
it
and
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
a
sixer
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
that
reminds
me
of
my
favorite
winter
warmer
old
fezziweg
o
solid
and
interesting
beer
a
good
balance
of
malt
hop
and
spice
perfect
for
the
cold
weather
i
could
drink
a
couple
worth
a
try
o
unfortunately
not
even
close
to
what
i
expect
or
look
for
in
this
style
just
doesnt
have
the
depth
or
interesting
notes
i
have
found
in
anchor
harpoon
or
samuel
smiths
just
missed
on
this
one
its
too
bad
too
because
i
do
enjoy
boulder
beers
o
nice
beer
but
not
really
what
i
think
of
with
a
warmer
with
the
hop
forward
profile
othis
drank
more
like
a
red
ale
than
a
winter
warmer
to
me
it
was
more
malty
and
flavorful
and
it
just
wasnt
well
balanced
it
was
still
a
decent
an
easy
to
drink
beer
but
its
not
something
ill
be
ordering
again
overall
id
buy
again
but
there
are
usually
better
options
overall
i
have
had
plenty
winter
warmers
that
i
would
rate
higher
than
this
however
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
move
of
an
amber
ale
than
a
winter
warmer
not
a
bad
drinker
but
a
weak
abv
winter
seasonal
without
anything
that
can
warm
me
up
from
the
cold
besides
a
very
subtle
spice
character
and
roast
finish
eh
overall
it
looks
and
smells
great
but
that
only
sets
up
for
a
huge
letdown
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
dr
a
mundane
beer
that
never
tries
to
surpass
its
own
selfacknowledged
mediocrity
drinkable
but
undesirable
o
like
others
have
said
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
it
a
winter
warmer
seems
to
me
its
more
of
an
amber
ale
by
taste
not
my
favorite
but
its
pretty
good
stuff
id
recommend
a
halfpint
for
sure
o
definetly
a
very
tame
winter
warmer
but
it
is
still
quite
sessionable
and
overall
really
nice
notes
decent
if
a
bit
forgettable
malty
offering
worth
the
repeat
if
there
were
not
may
more
options
around
o
very
comparable
to
the
winterhook
the
appearance
of
this
ale
gave
it
a
slight
edge
but
i
feel
like
its
a
tie
not
bad
stuff
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
a
unique
enough
brew
and
as
far
as
mystery
beers
go
in
a
variety
12
pack
this
one
is
legit
overall
i
am
somewhat
surprised
winter
warmers
are
not
always
my
favorite
beers
but
this
brew
has
found
a
niche
within
my
palate
id
definitely
quaff
this
again
clear
redish
brown
but
deep
color
minimal
lace
and
head
theres
no
doubt
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
really
could
have
been
on
another
level
with
a
bit
of
a
tweak
great
alternative
to
spiced
winter
ales
for
those
who
like
hops
dark
amber
red
color
with
short
lived
head
hop
presence
isnt
overpowering
a
tasty
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
as
great
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
these
this
winter
pours
a
radiant
glowing
redish
with
an
average
offwhite
head
looks
fantastic
nose
is
candied
sugars
and
perhaps
a
slight
spice
infusion
backed
up
by
what
is
sure
to
be
a
sturdy
malt
body
yup
there
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
might
indicate
balanced
nicely
for
the
heavier
mouthfeel
modest
carbonation
lets
this
one
gently
prickle
the
palate
a
bit
as
it
goes
down
overall
a
pretty
good
start
to
the
winter
warmer
season
here
but
with
an
abv
under
6
i
am
going
to
be
searching
for
something
warmer
come
the
snows
deep
reddish
orange
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
its
a
gorgeous
color
its
clear
and
the
bubbles
of
effervescence
sparkle
as
they
float
to
the
top
aroma
of
sweet
toasted
malts
and
hops
though
not
overpowering
i
didnt
smell
or
taste
the
secret
spices
flavor
of
rich
caramel
malt
is
front
and
center
hop
flavor
is
not
strong
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
mouth
feel
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
overall
im
a
big
fan
this
is
a
delicious
brew
that
has
a
very
high
drinkability
i
would
definitely
get
more
of
this
one
of
my
favorite
brew
fresh
but
in
all
fairness
this
brew
is
9
months
old
past
its
prime
so
its
hard
to
judge
i
wanted
to
share
with
other
what
an
aged
one
is
like
overall
i
was
very
happy
with
the
depth
of
flavor
and
body
this
beer
had
and
its
definitely
a
beer
that
i
hope
to
have
on
hand
on
a
more
consistent
basis
overall
overall
the
beer
was
pretty
good
the
beer
definitely
features
hops
but
blends
it
well
with
its
sweeter
notes
id
recommend
trying
this
beer
and
any
hop
heads
out
there
will
definitely
appreciate
this
one
although
i
was
very
dissapointed
with
the
overall
characteristics
of
this
beer
i
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
and
the
first
sessional
winter
warmer
i
have
encountered
i
like
this
winter
warmer
not
spiced
per
se
but
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
very
good
balance
well
it
is
still
is
winter
even
though
it
was
84
degrees
today
this
is
courtesy
of
botmc
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
smell
of
cocoa
and
cinnamon
almost
cappuccino
like
pours
to
a
light
root
beer
colour
with
a
medium
size
bubble
head
that
stands
up
initial
taste
is
very
evidently
cocoa
with
some
flatly
bitter
earthy
hops
taste
then
transitions
to
a
sweeter
malty
and
heath
bar
like
middle
while
still
maintaining
a
degree
of
bitterness
the
finishes
with
a
flat
bitterness
that
has
sweetness
around
the
edges
and
as
such
fades
into
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
to
sparkly
but
overall
very
tasty
brew
would
be
great
as
a
dessert
beer
and
next
to
the
fireplace
it
would
be
quite
at
home
o
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
because
ive
had
some
of
their
beers
that
i
liked
before
thought
this
was
good
but
i
dont
see
myself
getting
this
again
easy
to
drink
just
nothing
amazing
d
pour
me
another
as
the
bottle
states
makes
even
the
coldest
colorado
peaks
seem
warm
bring
on
the
snow
bunnies
d
a
little
too
light
and
sweet
to
command
respect
more
like
hanging
out
with
a
friend
than
an
authority
figure
you
can
have
a
good
time
with
this
but
it
wont
make
you
change
how
you
see
the
world
very
drinkable
great
session
beer
and
definitely
worth
buying
again
and
again
db
a
bit
better
from
what
i
was
expecting
a
winter
warmer
with
a
nice
array
of
balanced
flavors
the
mouth
is
slightly
thickish
with
low
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
session
it
has
some
interesting
facets
but
is
not
overpowering
in
any
of
its
taste
elements
drinkability
pretty
good
english
strong
ale
that
could
use
a
titch
more
body
as
well
as
a
little
more
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
still
quite
enjoyable
d
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
ive
had
and
would
definitely
consider
getting
again
also
i
like
the
low
abv
for
the
style
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
d
other
winter
warmers
23
max
i
feel
like
i
could
stand
on
the
porch
christmas
eve
with
friends
and
polish
off
6
of
em
before
the
cigar
runs
out
great
drinkability
4
55
o
a
very
good
brew
but
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
as
a
true
ww
in
my
opinion
i
think
the
assertive
hop
bitterness
may
have
masked
a
lot
of
other
flavors
that
were
probably
in
there
a
different
take
on
the
style
for
sure
low
on
the
spice
level
nice
malt
and
nice
hops
it
actually
makes
me
think
of
summer
rather
than
winter
a
great
beer
on
any
occasion
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
dimpled
mug
a
sleeper
of
the
winterchristmas
beer
bunch
i
evaluated
pours
a
deep
orangered
with
a
frothy
beige
head
that
leaves
behind
creamy
lace
dark
caramel
malt
light
nuttiness
and
pinyearthy
hops
all
merge
to
create
a
pleasant
aroma
light
to
mediumbodied
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
dry
and
moderately
bitter
finish
the
flavor
is
a
solid
dark
caramel
front
with
notes
of
spicy
earthy
hops
and
light
nuts
low
carbonation
a
balanced
palette
and
a
lower
than
expected
abv
make
this
a
drinkable
brew
especially
for
the
winter
warmer
style
not
sure
if
id
get
this
anytime
other
than
snowedin
periods
of
a
northeast
winter
but
it
seems
that
the
brewmasters
at
boulder
beer
club
thought
the
same
thing
when
naming
this
one
dvery
easy
drinking
and
balanced
beer
one
of
the
more
user
friendly
winter
warmersspiced
beer
out
there
drinkability
depends
on
ones
tolerance
for
a
dry
spicy
beer
for
me
it
was
the
right
flavor
combination
and
would
be
a
good
choice
after
a
day
on
the
slopes
with
a
name
like
summer
ale
this
beer
should
be
a
lot
lighter
not
a
summer
session
beer
not
even
any
type
of
sessional
beer
very
sharp
after
taste
harsh
metallic
and
does
not
go
down
smoothly
dont
even
waste
your
time
ordering
this
beer
youd
waste
your
money
and
time
id
only
drink
this
beer
if
it
was
free
smooth
and
medium
textured
the
carbonation
is
low
and
the
feel
is
enjoyable
the
palate
is
solid
and
as
a
result
the
beer
lends
itself
perfectly
to
drinking
while
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
i
am
excited
to
drink
the
next
2
bottles
overall
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
its
well
balanced
and
possibly
a
little
heavy
handed
on
the
hops
for
the
style
but
i
love
me
some
hoppy
goodness
bold
new
look
at
winter
beers
well
i
like
my
winter
brew
the
way
it
was
this
was
a
good
tasting
ale
but
i
like
more
body
and
flavor
o
its
pretty
drinkable
but
overall
not
all
that
impressive
not
saying
that
its
bad
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
as
a
winter
warmer
it
doesnt
hit

mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
but
has
clean
and
crisp
feel
overall
an
enjoyable
winter
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
going
on
here
d
well
i
really
dont
love
it
in
a
sense
that
its
an
in
your
face
spice
fest
like
i
love
in
warmers
but
after
it
warms
a
bit
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
english
makes
itself
know
and
it
gives
it
a
bitter
and
unforgiving
tone
to
the
beer
i
like
it
but
would
not
love
it
to
try
again
d
i
like
this
beer
however
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
similar
to
many
winter
beers
the
spice
is
good
but
i
cant
have
to
many
unlike
other
winter
warmers
this
beer
falls
a
little
short
in
terms
of
having
a
defining
quality
or
standing
out
in
a
major
way
never
summer
is
balanced
attenuated
a
bit
too
much
and
overspiced
with
that
out
of
the
way
i
enjoyed
it
good
flavor
with
some
woody
hops
brown
sugar
and
a
nice
stickiness
medium
body
finishes
pretty
thin
but
alright
nothing
new
under
this
sun
but
a
decent
drinking
brew
easily
quaffable
and
something
i
have
every
year
but
not
in
big
numbers
mouthfeeldrinkability
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
winter
warmer
but
is
overall
easy
to
drink
and
a
beer
id
probably
have
again
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruits
and
dry
malts
in
the
taste
roasty
malt
with
dry
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
dark
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
winter
warmer
easy
to
drink
just
above
average
drinkability
well
its
easy
enough
to
drink
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drop
back
a
few
pints
but
i
wouldnt
be
excited
or
all
that
interested
in
doing
so
not
a
beer
ill
be
seeking
out
d
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
but
disappointing
if
you
were
expecting
flavor
andor
spiciness
of
a
winter
warmer
another
great
selection
from
a
brewery
that
never
ceases
to
produce
quality
brews
that
are
both
unique
and
balanced
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
the
aroma
smells
of
roasted
and
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
balanced
to
the
point
where
you
almost
cant
taste
the
hops
there
is
a
spice
flavor
there
that
i
cant
seem
to
find
a
description
for
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
almost
a
medium
heavy
feel
low
carbonation
as
well
overall
i
think
this
is
very
drinkable
d
flavorful
and
fairly
smooth
easy
to
drink
without
wearing
down
overall
tasty
not
too
sweet
like
some
winter
warmers
moreys
bottom
line
although
i
liked
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
for
some
reason
reminds
me
a
bit
of
stoudts
winter
ale
20092011
but
not
quite
as
good
this
one
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
fruity
esters
and
dark
caramel
dominate
the
smell
hops
are
evident
only
as
a
counterbalancing
bitterness
but
they
never
overwhelm
the
dark
caramel
and
dried
fruit
flavors
coming
from
the
malt
and
yeast
esters
special
b
or
something
close
to
it
shines
through
i
think
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
but
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
lightweight
in
the
winter
warmer
realm
though
still
a
tasty
one
ive
had
this
on
tap
several
times
in
previous
years
and
it
was
pretty
similar
to
isolation
from
odell
these
bottles
have
had
borderline
ipalevel
hop
bitterness
drinkability
although
not
terribly
complex
it
does
have
an
intriguing
taste
but
possibly
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
to
endure
for
any
extended
period
of
time
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
nicely
hopped
but
with
some
sweat
malts
that
really
balance
out
the
flavor
pours
a
red
copper
color
with
abut
14
inch
head
with
goos
lacing
on
the
nose
you
immediatly
notice
the
hops
with
a
pine
citrus
note
but
also
you
can
pick
up
on
sweat
maltyspice
the
palate
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
malts
d
i
dont
know
if
the
firkin
of
this
was
bad
or
what
but
this
beer
was
below
average
i
like
the
complexity
of
winter
warmers
but
this
one
tasted
sour
and
nothing
like
the
style
pours
a
moderately
dark
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
red
in
there
nose
brings
forward
some
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
apple
as
well
as
some
light
hops
taste
is
pretty
malty
without
much
spice
as
would
be
expected
caramel
and
some
brown
sugar
with
a
bit
of
apple
and
lighter
fruits
medium
creamy
body
with
good
carbonation
a
good
beer
and
a
nice
alternative
to
many
of
the
overspiced
editions
that
find
their
way
around
during
the
winter
redbrown
and
crystal
clear
fair
head
retention
quick
dissipation
no
signs
of

malt
predominates
the
aroma

sweet
faint

medium
to
medium

up

fades
as
the
beer
warms
keep
cold
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
yet
transparent
copperred
with
a
very
thin
white
head
and
poor
retention
smelled
of
toffee
caramel
apple
and
subtle
grassyherbal
hops
the
taste
confirmed
a
big
sweetmaltycaramel
dominance
with
a
bitter
hop
bite
on
the
finish
and
a
lingering
dryness
afterwards
thick
and
creamy
with
little
carbonation
i
guess
it
stands
to
reason
that
someone
from
colorado
would
make
a
good
winter
ale
d
dangerously
drinkable
thick
but
light
at
the
same
time
id
even
call
it
a
lager
if
i
didnt
know
better
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
with
a
nice
rubybrown
color
and
a
light
tan
head
of
about
one
finger
that
dissipated
quickly
and
laced
minimally
aroma
was
of
an
earthy
nature
with
roasted
malts
taste
is
malty
with
again
an
earthy
flavor
feel
is
smooth
with
light
carbonation
and
a
medium
feel
good
winter
beverage
that
reminds
me
some
of
a
scotch
ale
coppery
red
with
a
thick
tan
head
of
foam
that
leaves
scraps
of
lace
on
the
glass
caramel
malt
and
faint
holiday
spice
in
the
nose
sweet
caramel
maltiness
balanced
with
plenty
of
cascade
hop
flavors
brown
sugar
and
candied
grapefruit
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
clove
medium
light
bodied
for
the
style
not
the
biggest
winter
warmer
in
the
world
but
a
darn
tasty
and
well
hopped
lightweight
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
thick
lacing
it
smells
strongly
of
hops
and
faintly
of
citrus
this
is
a
moderately
hoppy
beer
for
the
style
but
its
well
balanced
with
some
caramel
malts
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
i
dont
know
that
i
could
do
a
session
of
it
unless
it
was
in
the
middle
of
winter
pours
a
pretty
dark
ruby
with
a
one
finger
khaki
head
smells
of
fresh
grapefruit
hops
with
hints
of
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
a
bit
watery
toasted
biscuit
tones
with
a
caramel
and
nutty
flavor
sweet
piney
hops
and
a
bitter
finish
all
in
all
a
good
winter
warmer
with
familiar
flavors
just
not
bold
enough
for
me
picked
this
brew
up
since
most
of
the
offerings
from
boulder
i
have
had
in
the
past
where
pretty
good
this
brew
poured
to
a
clear
vibrant
amber
color
with
a
thick
off
white
to
tan
head
that
had
great
retention
and
left
lots
of
lacing
throughout
caramel
and
a
slight
biscuit
aroma
come
to
mind
from
the
malt
nice
amount
of
hop
aroma
comes
through
the
nose
from
this
one
seems
to
me
that
the
willamette
and
cascade
hops
really
show
up
and
mix
together
quite
well
the
flavor
is
a
very
good
mix
of
malt
flavors
which
really
create
the
backbone
as
the
flavors
are
always
there
caramel
and
toasted
flavors
come
to
mind
hops
give
a
real
nice
flavor
profile
here
while
not
in
your
face
they
are
on
the
dominant
side
for
me
the
spices
do
not
really
come
out
at
all
but
maybe
i
am
just
missing
them
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
easy
drinking
not
really
sure
why
this
is
considered
just
a
winter
warmer
it
is
an
overall
good
brew
pours
a
one
finger
head
and
a
dark
amber
in
color
the
smell
is
actually
hinting
at
chocolate
aromas
the
taste
is
ok
kind
of
a
nutty
chocolate
malt
flavor
not
as
chocolate
as
a
chocolate
stout
or
such
but
more
a
subtle
nut
brown
taste
an
ok
mouthfeel
nothing
spectacular
but
drinkable
nonetheless
and
certainly
nothing
offensive
d
high
can
definitely
drink
this
throughout
the
winter
months
and
then
some
mouthfeel
is
medium
drinkability
is
good
low
abv
tastes
fine
etc
its
a
good
beer
but
not
extraordinary
recommended
d
a
fairly
bland
beer
but
what
is
there
is
enjoyable
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
drinkability
is
fine
a
solid
beer
grabbed
this
one
cause
ive
had
solid
beers
from
boulder
in
the
past
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
dissolves
fast
and
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
quiet
toffee
malt
nose
very
mild
not
much
going
on
taste
is
similar
mostly
a
grainy
toffee
malt
taste
some
light
dried
fruit
a
little
citrus
maybe
fine
body
good
carbonation
good
beer
kind
of
a
standard
malty
winter
brew
probably
would
go
with
anchor
or
a
couple
others
over
this
just
for
something
with
a
little
going
on
pours
a
really
nice
looking
deep
amber
color
with
a
tiny
head
it
looks
really
good
smell
is
not
very
potent
some
caramel
aromas
are
the
most
prevalent
but
nothing
else
is
really
overpowering
taste
i
pretty
good
has
a
nice
malt
body
to
it
that
gives
it
most
of
its
taste
but
there
is
still
a
nice
hop
flavor
to
it
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
somewhat
thick
drinkabily
is
pretty
good
its
a
tasty
beer
and
good
on
a
cold
night
like
tonight
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
crisp
dark
orange
with
a
decent
offwhite
diminishing
head
that
leaves
just
a
slight
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slight
caramel
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
a
decent
balance
of
burnt
caramel
and
pine
hops
with
just
enough
spices
such
as
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
to
make
this
a
respectable
winter
warmer
the
beer
is
fairly
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
very
respectable
winter
warmer
one
i
likely
would
have
again
this
poured
a
pretty
deep
amber
color
that
produced
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
faded
to
a
nice
foamy
ring
the
pour
immediately
relased
a
hoppy
sweet
aroma
after
the
initial
aroma
i
thought
it
would
be
quite
hoppy
it
isnt
it
is
pretty
smooth
and
well
balanced
has
a
little
piney
flavor
with
an
alcohol
after
taste
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
wife
picked
this
up
for
me
at
cbe
i
read
the
label
and
saw
that
it
was
assertively
hopped
and
malted
so
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
a
bit
hoppier
to
me
though
it
was
well
balanced
between
the
two
the
hops
are
up
front
but
then
fade
out
to
the
malts
and
spices
not
one
of
the
best
wws
ive
had
but
still
pretty
decent
d
could
definitely
polish
off
a
few
of
these
its
a
beer
that
grows
on
you
this
is
an
excellent
winter
season
session
worthy
brew
i
could
easily
drink
this
for
awhile
without
getting
sick
of
it
d
i
like
that
its
not
overpowering
on
the
spices
like
most
within
the
style
with
a
nice
subtle
hop
presence
drinkability
is
ok
decent
pale
ale
but
wheres
the
winter
warmer
spice
d
a
bit
too
much
residual
sweetness
to
crave
this
beer
but
this
is
well
crafted
and
ill
enjoy
sipping
on
one
or
two
on
a
cool
evening
overall
a
fine
winter
beer
a
little
stronghoppy
for
my
tastes
but
that
is
a
personal
opinion
and
doesnt
reflect
in
my
ratings
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
one
that
i
would
recommend
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
for
cold
nights
wont
need
more
than
23
in
a
sitting
to
warm
you
up
and
keep
your
tastes
pleased
this
is
def
going
on
my
list
for
the
season
d
overall
this
is
another
nice
beer
from
boulder
it
actually
drank
stronger
for
me
than
it
really
is
which
was
an
interesting
change
of
pace
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
d
drinkable
though
it
is
a
bit
too
heavy
for
a
session
beer
the
hop
character
is
ok
but
kind
of
generic
the
malt
character
is
very
nice
and
really
makes
the
beer
conclusion
ive
kind
of
split
on
my
opinions
of
boulders
beers
this
one
however
is
quite
tasty
and
one
ill
probably
check
out
next
winter
as
a
more
affordable
alternative
to
some
of
my
favorite
examples
from
across
the
pond
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
well
made
beer
and
ill
keep
and
eye
open
for
it
in
the
future
if
given
a
choice
im
not
sure
id
pick
it
over
some
of
the
other
winter
warmers
to
be
found
during
the
cold
weather
but
it
is
certainly
worth
a
return
visit
this
one
pours
fairly
clear
dark
red
with
an
offwhite
head
and
a
bit
of
haze
the
aroma
is
moderatehigh
caramel
with
moderate
floral
hop
the
flavor
is
high
sweet
caramel
that
is
quickly
replaced
by
moderate
citrus
hop
flavor
and
drying
hop
bitterness
which
lingers
in
the
mouth
the
body
is
mediumfull
rather
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
winter
brew
worth
a
shot
although
unlikely
to
drink
a
lot
in
one
sitting
the
taste
wont
disappoint
it
is
a
sweet
slightly
cloying
beer
but
the
slight
molasses
flavor
slight
brown
sugar
definite
roasted
caramel
malts
are
very
nice
there
is
a
nice
bready
sweet
caramelized
malty
base
underneath
that
is
very
enticing
the
hop
is
present
just
enough
to
insinuate
itself
the
hop
is
a
bit
dry
a
bit
leafy
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
sweet
nutty
flavor
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
sticky
sweet
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
mild
this
is
a
lighter
bodied
winter
warmer
with
a
fairly
modest
abv
there
is
not
a
lot
to
be
disappointed
with
in
this
beer
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
ok
beer
not
bad
but
would
not
tap
again
d
rather
easy
to
drink
pretty
consistent
with
most
winter
warmers
however
ive
had
better
t
m
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
mostly
malt
but
a
slight
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
a
decent
winter
ale
i
definitely
cant
complain
for
the
price
d
drinkable
and
pleasant
but
thats
about
as
strong
a
recommendation
as
i
can
give
either
more
sweetness
or
more
hops
would
help
out
this
brew
it
doesnt
know
which
way
to
go
so
it
doesnt
get
very
far
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
chewiness
a
good
beer
overall
perhaps
a
little
fresher
this
might
be
a
real
treat
seemed
slightly
cardboardy
and
oxidized
but
even
with
that
this
was
a
nice
beer
d
okay
and
not
great
i
was
not
a
winter
beer
fan
before
this
one
and
remain
unconverted
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
pretty
good
probably
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
that
ive
had
this
year
not
too
malty
with
some
ample
hops
well
rounded
with
good
fruitiness
will
revisit
and
recommend
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
several
beers
within
the
style
that
i
would
choose
over
this
one
overall
i
think
this
one
is
pretty
good
it
doesnt
really
follow
the
other
winter
warmers
ive
had
stylistically
but
i
think
it
tastes
pretty
damn
good
d
an
enjoyable
brew
whose
hops
are
a
pleasant
surprise
on
the
winter
warmer
scene
a
little
more
in
the
scent
and
mouthfeel
departments
would
go
a
long
way
to
making
this
a
much
better
beer
i
would
drink
again
in
the
future
but
not
seek
our
or
recommended
md
very
smooth
and
earthy
brew
a
very
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
make
this
one
a
definite
must
try
overall
not
the
best
winter
warmer
but
not
the
worst
i
could
see
myself
having
another
quite
easily
as
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
pours
an
auburnishcopper
with
a
thin
beige
skim
of
a
head
slight
head
retention
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
of
caramel
malt
and
light
pineyfloral
hops
taste
is
very
very
piney
begins
with
extreme
piney
flavoring
and
floral
hops
a
spice
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
then
moves
to
a
bit
of
caramelized
flavoring
there
is
graininess
in
the
mouthfeel
and
has
a
big
salty
astringent
blast
the
astringency
lingers
through
the
remainder
not
hidden
in
the
least
by
the
floral
hops
this
beer
may
appeal
to
some
but
was
not
for
me
i
picked
up
subtle
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
capped
off
by
a
slight
bitter
finish
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
winter
ale
drinkability
very
good
no
probs
with
the
lightish
alcohol
content
and
it
is
tasty
enough
a
nice
winter
warmer
if
youre
not
into
spices
higher
alcohol
and
overly
hopped
brews
i
like
and
head
retention
and
lacing
are
above
average
d
you
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
during
the
colder
months
for
sure
drinkability
quite
high
overall
seems
almost
more
like
an
ipa
rather
than
a
winter
warmer

and
great

highly
recommended
dquite
drinkable
though
not
as
warming
a
winter
warmer
as
some
versions
out
there
the
hoppiness
in
this
brew
is
refreshing
in
a
sea
of
maltdriven
wws
im
all
for
this
one
drinkablility
ive
been
able
to
drink
a
fair
amount
of
this
without
getting
tired
of
it
thumbs
up
here
as
such
this
beer
had
the
rich
amber
color
ive
come
to
expect
from
winter
ales
the
distinct
taste
of
the
hops
was
pleasantly
apparent
but
not
over
powering
i
thought
this
was
very
similar
to
the
spanish
peaks
winter
cheer
d
fairly
drinkable
if
its
up
your
alley
d
this
is
just
a
terribly
average
beer
without
much
character
or
taste
poured
out
of
12
oz
bottle
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
half
finger
of
light
tan
head
minimal
lacing
on
glass
smells
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
malt
and
light
hop
smell
taste
is
very
good
better
than
i
expected
honestly
biscuitlike
hops
and
smooth
malt
flavor
lead
to
a
clean
finish
perfect
combination
of
hops
and
malts
light
mouthfeel
and
not
as
dry
as
most
hoppy
ales
very
drinkable
probably
my
favorite
beer
yet
from
boulder
beer
co
not
my
first
choice
given
choices
but
will
definetly
drink
again
drink
beer
becomes
more
forward
as
i
drank
with
more
distinct
vanilla
and
spices
with
clear
malt
coming
through
easy
enough
to
drink
but
its
so
mild
that
its
hardly
worth
it
its
ok
but
nothing
outstanding
yeah
i
agree
with
the
other
reviewers
in
that
this
beer
is
average
the
taste
is
smooth
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
with
not
much
else
really
exposing
itself
i
really
didnt
pick
up
much
from
this
beer
to
suggest
that
it
is
a
winter
warmer
if
handed
this
with
no
label
i
might
assume
it
is
just
a
hopped
amber
of
no
particular
origin
poured
a
solid
amber
with
a
light
brown
head
that
disappeared
quickly
seems
pretty
clear
with
low
carbonation
smells
of
an
aboveaverage
perhaps
spicy
maltiness
its
a
good
medium
body
in
the
mouth
and
tastes
like
a
decent
holiday
spiciness
with
a
good
malt
flavor
as
well
overall
pretty
drinkable
nothing
spectacular
but
overall
a
solid
brew
overall
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
many
better
for
the
style
notes
from
21607
tasty
satisfying
little
brew
we
got
here
very
malty
and
filling
with
a
good
dash
of
flavorful
hops
and
some
ever
so
subtle
spiciness
aroma
is
balanced
and
pleasant
nice
chestnut
pour
thick
off
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
covering
the
glass
very
creamy
and
satisfying
thick
malts
slightly
sweet
with
a
great
hop
taste
a
pinch
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
with
a
dash
of
pine
and
a
touch
of
mixed
spices
this
is
a
clever
ale
nicely
crafted
poured
this
deep
red
slight
copper
beer
into
a
beer
mug
its
flavorful
aroma
of
cloves
caramel
malts
that
are
sweet
to
the
nose
its
taste
follows
suit
in
the
sweetness
and
it
also
haves
a
great
earth
tones
taste
overall
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
when
it
is
cold
out
i
had
this
on
tap
at
high
street
grill
the
beer
was
a
dark
red
with
a
solid
head
i
thought
the
hops
were
prevalent
on
the
nose
at
first
but
as
the
beer
warmed
it
did
smell
sweeter
the
first
sip
had
a
profound
hoppy
profile
that
melllowed
into
a
more
malty
brew
i
really
did
not
notice
any
spices
that
were
added
this
beer
has
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
never
summer
is
very
easily
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
imo
it
tasted
more
like
a
red
ale
a
winter
warmer
on
the
lighter
side
very
sessionable
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
thin
white
head
aroma
of
bourbon
and
light
fruit
pretty
smooth
with
a
lot
of
apple
and
bourbon
flavor
tasted
kind
of
like
a
mix
of
whiskey
and
apple
cider
but
in
a
good
way
nice
to
see
a
winter
without
the
cinnamon
and
pine
and
all
the
other
spice
that
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
lucky
to
get
this
on
tap
the
bartender
at
smiths
told
me
there
were
only
4
kegs
in
mass
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
receded
quickly
leaving
light
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
caramel
malts
slightly
spicy
and
light
hopping
taste
was
fairly
similar
toasty
malts
sweet
brown
sugar
and
molasses
a
peppery
spiciness
piney
hops
and
some
light
citrus
creamy
on
the
tongue
light
carbonation
an
ok
ww
but
have
had
several
other
that
were
much
more
pleasing
over
the
past
few
days
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
med
cloudy
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
quickly
disappeared
as
another
reviewer
stated
it
looked
like
old
cloudy
iced
tea
it
had
no
aroma
i
was
expecting
a
more
malty
spicey
beer
but
this
was
much
hoppier
than
i
expected
some
hint
of
malts
but
the
beer
was
overall
a
bitter
brew
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
with
very
little
fizz
i
had
bought
a
6pack
to
take
to
a
party
took
4
home
had
to
switch
to
the
house
beer
overall
just
a
very
average
beer
couldnt
drink
more
that
1
or
2
at
a
time
have
a
feeling
these
are
going
to
linger
in
my
beer
fridge
for
awhile
disappointed
this
poured
a
dark
clear
auburn
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
grapefruit
and
orange
hops
with
honey
malt
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
it
tasted
like
creamy
orange
hops
with
honey
malt
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
it
was
fairly
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
more
hoppy
than
expected
but
it
was
very
tasty
it
was
clean
and
had
great
body
and
was
super
easy
to
drink
theres
not
much
to
complain
about
here
despite
a
lack
of
originality
to
me
the
winter
warmer
genre
is
one
that
can
either
be
very
good
or
mediocre
its
a
difficult
one
to
pull
off
and
unfortunately
this
one
falls
in
the
mediocre
category
the
spices
werent
backed
up
by
a
roasty
full
malty
backbone
and
thats
what
i
look
for
pours
reddish
orange
heading
toward
brown
with
an
okay
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
swirl
smells
quite
malty
with
a
touch
of
spice
sweet
and
maybe
some
figs
in
there
slightly
sweet
and
malty
a
bit
thin
with
some
wax
and
some
spice
and
some
breadiness
pretty
pleasant
a
bit
thin
and
waxy
in
the
mouth
with
a
hint
of
spicygrainy
sourness
at
the
end
not
bad
and
actually
probably
better
as
a
fall
beverage
i
think
it
lacks
the
body
and
oomph
for
the
winter
i
drank
this
on
a
warm
day
haha
yeah
it
says
never
summer
on
the
label
but
whatever
deep
amber
colored
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
malts
caramel
with
some
honey
and
a
little
hops
in
the
background
its
actually
a
nice
aroma
this
beer
is
rich
with
a
pretty
full
mouthfeel
and
quite
warming
a
very
nice
malt
bitter
hop
bite
balance
to
the
flavor
with
some
caramel
and
spices
mixed
in
the
beer
is
quite
good
and
next
time
i
will
have
it
on
a
cool
day
and
im
sure
it
will
be
just
that
much
better
pours
a
glowing
red
amber
body
in
a
tumbler
with
a
short
offwhite
head
that
settles
quicklyalmost
the
appearance
of

away

moving

latewith
some

toonice

smooth
mildly
effervescent

that

with

a

with
minimal

balance
belying
its
nose
quite
an
american
approximation
of
the
esb
brother
jer
decided
to
select
this
as
our
light
beer
to
the
yanksos
tailgatewhoops
that
never
implies
a
yearround
treat
as
such
not
bad
borderlining
as
complex
but
still
holds
to
its
basic
caramel
maltsthe
spices
are
too
secret
to
move
the
beer
into
that
winter
beer
genre
taste
is
of
caramel
spice
roasted
nuts
malt
very
christmasy
weak
on
the
palate
with
some
pine
this
beer
is
quite
easy
on
the
eyes
but
loses
points
at
every
step
after
that
it
is
sweet
but
thin
with
some
unwelcome
oxidized
and
vegetal
flavors
bitternesshop
flavor
is
strictly
average
it
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
not
make
much
of
an
effort
to
seek
out
this
beer
again
a
good
winter
warmer
a
deep
maroon
brown
color

the
taste
also
has
a
good
malt
structure
not
as
spicy
as
i
like
to
see
in
this
style
needs
to
be
kicked
up
another
notch
medium
to
full
body
fairly
smooth
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
its
okay
relatively
mild
in
terms
of
flavor
and
spice
character
when
compared
to
its
winter
warmer
brethren
which
is
fine
as
some
of
the
ones
on
the
far
end
can
frankly
be
rather
gross
pours
a
very
nice
deep
orange
reddish
color
with
a
small
thin
head
almost
no
lacing
below
average
carbonation
with
a
fairly
strong
smell
of

weak
with
a
very
light
body
tad
f

bitterness
followed
b
some
sweetness
not
enough

to
be
had
again
overall
drinkablity
is
good
you
could
easily
session
d
easy
to
drink
beer
a
little
out
of
season
but
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
night
or
after
skiing
all
day
pretty
tasty
well
being
this
winter
warmer
does
not
have
any
hint
of
the
sickening
spices
characteristic
of
the
style
that
is
a
big
win
nice
deep
malty
presence
makes
for
a
great
crossover
from
portersstouts
to
spring
ales
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
citrusy
hops
dark
fruit
and
caramel
the
aroma
leans
a
lot
more
towards
the
hops
the
taste
is
more
balanced
than
the
aroma
the
malty
caramel
backbone
gets
the
hops
from
overpowering
everything
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
winter
beer
i
could
drink
it
again

a

welcomed
it
is
inviting
the
palate
is
pleasantly
hoppy
very
unexpected
actually
the
outright
bitterness
is
solid
but
the
hops
add
flavorful
depth
largely
piney
a
hint
of
citrus
that
can
be
found
squarely
on
top
of
the
sweet
slightly
toffeelike
malts
the
spiciness
is
mild
hot
candylike
this
is
a
mighty
tasty
beverage
and
yet
another
reason
to
take
note
of
the
looking
glass
series
mediumfull
body
modest
and
appropriate
carbonation
that
produces
a
pleasant
effortless
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
i
am
impressed
with
and
something
i
need
to
quaff
again

the
beer
could
use
a
pinch
more
malt
in
each
bottle
poured

left

with

with
that
intriguing

taste
it

it
to
be
more
robust
this
winter
brew
is
very
nice

a
nice
rich

an
nice
easy
drinking
brew
it
has
a
pleasent
floral

but
over
the
top
some
like
hopped
up
brews
interesting
the
taste
is
not
what
expected
in
a
very
good
way
winter
warmer
always
makes
me
nervous
some
are
too
spicy
and
lose
their
identity
this
one
is
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
its
hints
of
malts
but
it
has
a
nice
noticeable
hoppiness
worth
the
trip
it
poured
a
dark
ruby
red
in
color
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
was
okay
i
caught
caramel
and
hoppy
notes
in
there
the
taste
was
good
i
could
really
taste
the
caramel
hops
and
malt
flavor
the
balance
wasnt
the
best
and
i
feel
that
it
made
for
a
tough
drink
if
it
were
a
little
better
i
may
have
enjoyed
it
more
but
it
was
okay
i
dont
know
if
i
would
go
for
this
one
again
d
a
above
average
brown
ale
but
a
just
barely
above
average
winter
warmer
i
like
my
winter
warmers
with
just
a
little
more
alcohol
and
more
spice
half
is
carmel
and
x
thickness
on
the
tongue
and
half
is
a
hopped
apple
and
citrus
fruitiness
somewhat
lagerish
and
also
an
ale
some
peachy
colour
and
a
maltiness
in
the
aroma
the
x
could
be
some
wheat
or
even
flour
there
may
be
some
cinammon
in
here
not
a
bad
one
poured
from
a
12oz
crown
cap
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
poured
aggressively
resulting
in
a
1
finger
head
of
foam
clear
and
copper
in
color
it
left
a
nice
lacing
started
with
a
malty
sherry
like
nose
with
an
off
smell
i
couldnt
identify
i
started
this
one
out
too
cold
and
it
little
flavor
at
first
but
progressed
into
a
malty
toffee
like
quality
i
thought
it
finished
poorly
with
a
petrol
fusel
alcohol
flavor
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
i
thought
it
to
be
thin
for
the
style
and
didnt
care
for
it
ive
liked
several
of
boulders
other
offerings
but
not
this
one
a
deep
rosey
brown
ale
with
thin
but
solid
tan
head
and
fine
lacing
a
very
welcoming
aroma
of
malt
and
herbal
hops
deep
and
sweet
with
some
nutty
caramel
present
beautiful
a
very
drinkable
malty
sweet
bread
flavor
with
very
nice
carbonation
and
midland
body
thinner
than
i
expected
for
the
style
but
it
made
it
that
much
more
drinkable
more
so
than
most
winter
warmers
i
think
it
has
an
odd
blend
of
sweet
horshound
and
bitter
root
it
grows
on
you
smells
a
little
more
inviting
than
it
tastes
but
it
is
very
nice
and
excellent
quality
this
could
fill
a
pretty
long
session
i
would
think
this
isnt
your
typical
overly
spiced
winter
warmer
but
thats
what
i
really
like
about
it
good
blend
of
flavors
and
decent
complexity
i
give
it
a
big
thumbs
up
in
my
book
notes
somewhat
disappointing
but
not
altogether
bad
just
mediocre
i
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
carbonation
is
acceptable
but
unfortunately
the
beer
feels
stretched
quite
thin
across
my
palate
not
quite
up
to
par
for
a
winter
warmer
in
this
respect
but
otherwise
an
enjoyable
beer
i
had
little
trouble
finishing
and
even
less
trouble
envisioning
another
in
my
glass
d
good
drinkability
at
the
fireplace
of
the
ski
lodge
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
winter
months
it
pours
a
deep
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
that
has
excellent
lacing
throughout
consumption
it
smells
of
candied
fruit
and
spices
with
a
slight
hop
characteristic
the
taste
is
very
sweet
the
fruit
and
nutmeg
are
prevolent
throughout
and
it
finishes
with
slight
hops
it
is
very
pleasing
on
the
palate
and
is
just
chunky
enough
for
winter
warmer
in
the
mouth
i
could
easily
drink
a
sixer
of
this
in
a
heartbeat
its
an
easy
drinker
and
always
leaves
a
nice
warm
feeling
in
the
belly
an
excellent
winter
beer
cheers
dability
a
nice
malty
roasty
beer
with
nice
balance
d
good
beer
very
sessionable
and
nicely
balanced
there
yet
its
not
bad
though
not
the
most
delicious
brew
and
probably
not
something
i
would
consider
winter
warmer
rather
its
an
american
version
of
a
belgian
dark
to
me
as
its
pretty
sugary
and
malty
judge
for
yourself
but
enjoy
it
regardless
22oz
bottle
on
sale
for
2
50
so
what
the
hell
right
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
super
malty
smell
the
taste
was
a
nice
subtle
malty
flavor
and
i
quickly
drank
two
glasses
nice
stuff
and
reaffirms
my
belief
in
the
quality
of
boulder
beers
colorado
rules
d
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
spices
i
agree
with
a
few
reviews
that
this
tastes
more
like
an
amber
ale
than
a
winter
warmer
this
is
a
light
and
enjoyable
little
winter
number
it
could
definitely
make
for
a
nice
winter
session
side
note
i
think
this
style
is
not
a
winter
warmer
this
tastes
to
me
like
an
amber
ale
instead
boulder
beer
is
really
impressing
me
ive
been
grabbing
random
stuff
whenever
i
can
find
it
and
its
well
worth
it
and
at
their
price
point
im
really
happy
w
it
from
a
12oz
bottle
that
i
copped
singly
at
wine
and
more
in
west
orange
pours
a
brownish
copper
honeydew
color
that
presented
itself
with
a
decent
head
smell
is
sweet
and
full
of
caramel
taste
was
really
good
full
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
sweetness
i
really
liked
this
brew
though
i
have
had
better
samples
of
the
style
a
good
taste
that
presents
itself
as
an
easy
brew
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
and
the
relatively
low
alcohol
percentage
for
a
winter
warmer
makes
for
really
good
drinkability
would
probably
try
this
again
as
it
was
a
satisfying
brew
never
heard
of
this
company
before
but
i
gotta
recommend
this
one
a
good
solid
brew
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
caramel
brown
head
with
traces
of
lacing
loved
the
smell
of
this
winter
warmer
while
pouring
into
a
slightly
frosted
mug
tasted
a
hint
of
citrus
in
the
hops
and
other
spices
that
my
palate
couldnt
differentiate
excellent
mouthfeel
and
after
taste
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
this
review
based
on
my
fourth
bottle
of
the
my
original
six
pack
notes
unfortunately
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
at
olivers
as
id
never
heard
of
it
before
while
drinking
it
i
couldnt
help
but
wish
id
bought
an
entire
6pack
as
i
wouldve
like
to
have
had
another
and
maybe
even
another
after
that
flavorful
with
a
nice
hopmalt
balance
to
it
and
just
a
hint
of
spice
i
wouldnt
characterize
it
as
an
overthetop
spicedup
winter
warmer
in
style
but
more
like
an
american
winter
pale
ale
if
that
makes
any
sense
definitely
worth
checking
out

drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
tealike
flavor
just
isnt
my
thing
so
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
stuff
part
of
a
beer
of
the
month
pack
and
if
the
rest
of
the
months
are
this
great
things
are
lookin
up
deep
brown
color
in
the
glass
with
nice
head
and
lacing
malt
and
a
definite
but
delicate
hop
scent
in
the
nose
taste
is
rich
malt
with
a
very
nice
hop
bite
to
add
a
touch
of
fruity
bitterness
and
complete
the
formula
for
what
is
really
a
wonderfully
drinkable
complex
ale
another
winner
from
boulder
pours
medium
brown
no
head
tiny
bit
of
lacing
lightly
carbonated
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
mediocre
not
very
malty
but
very
alcoholy
for
a
strong
ale
i
would
highly
expect
a
lot
more
abv
and
some
more
powerful
flavors
this
one
hits
a
little
below
the
mark
for
a
strong
ale
smell
is
a
strong
malt
profile
with
almost
no
hops
reminds
me
of
barleysugar
taste
is
much
the
samevery
sweet
and
somewhat
sticky
in
the
mouthfeel
there
are
maybe
some
slight
fruit
elements
on
the
palate
not
in
a
hurry
to
try
this
one
again
had
on
tap
at
untamed
steakhouse
in
winter
park
co
it
is
a
dark
redbrown
beer
with
a
dense
but
thin
tan
head
the
smell
is
very
intriguing
wassal
and
hops
definitely
a
winter
beer
the
taste
is
spice
and
hops
up
front
with
a
caramel
malt
back
and
then
a
hop
finish
the
hops
are
more
flavoring
than
bittering
and
the
beer
strikes
a
nice
hopmalt
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
light
with
a
nice
carbonation
drinkability
it
doesnt
get
much
better
the
balanced
flavor
is
not
too
aggressive
not
too
bland
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
could
really
settle
into
a
cold
winters
night
with
a
decent
brew
just
a
little
too
much
spice
for
my
taste
still
i
had
no
problems
finishing
the

tasty

poured
beer
into

at
50

a
nice
redbrown

the

years

smell
was
slightly
nutty
bready
with
a
light
hoppy
taste
but
not
too
overpowering
head
was
fast
decaying
with
slight
lacing
was
a
interesting
beer
to
try
but
will
not
purchase
again
the
feel
is
thick
and
syrupy
mediciny
its
hard
to
drink
for
me
has
too
much
of
a
robitussin
sweetness
with
no
bitter
or

not
a
pleasant
drink

me

allow

somehow
pine

malty
dark
bitter

then
resinous

and
a

before
it
finishes
rather
dry
and
quick
finish
but
feels
rather
invigorating
in
the
mouth
quite
a
nice

beer
well
worth
a

drinkability
easy
to
quaff
and
could
be
a
nice

in
the

this
is

there

a

with
a
fair
amount
of

pretty
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
winter
seasonal
i
am
fairly
impressed
by
this
brew
this
is
a
very
nice
addition
to
anyones
winter
beer
menu
the
great
caramel
malt
foundation
and
mix
piney
citrusy
hops
is
balanced
to
the
point
where
the
flavors
transition
well
enough
to
enjoy
both
equally
d
i
think
id
pass
on
this
if
it
came
around
again
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
as
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
nonexistent
pours
a
nice
deep
ruby
red
color
with
about
a
one
inch
head
has
some
great
malt
flavor
and
smelll
that
reminds
me
of
some
caramel
only
has
a
slight
hint
of
spice
not
to
much
not
to
little
to
make
this
a
find
addition
to
anyones
winter
definitly
worth
a
try
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
on
a
snowy
day
this
beer
is
eminently
drinkable
right
now
light
and
quaffable
yet
has
lots
of
flavor
to
keep
one
interested
but
not
so
much
as
to
distract
one
from
a
social
session
of
beer
drinking
with
an
apparent
lack
of
bottle
conditioning
it
will
probably
deteriorate
pretty
quickly
like
the
mojo
which
is
stellar
fresh
but
ages
quickly
so
get
some
fresh
and
drink
it
up
as
iswas
the
case
with
the
other
boulder
beers
in
their
looking
glass
series
i
liked
this
one
its
well
crafted
and
has
a
nice
bit
of
flavour
to
it
and
is
quite
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
at
the
least
and
a
nice
winter
brew
that
ill
likely
be
going
back
to
cheers
clear

quickly
to

and
ring
grainy
aroma
with
some
dark

like
raisin
and
dates
and
a
brown
sugar
like
sweetness
the
taste
also
has
a
brown
sugar
like
flavor
to
the
malt
some
fruity
flavors
do
linger
but
are
not
strong
i
was
impressed
with
a
decent
hop
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
all
that
interesting
overall
a
nice
beer
for
winter
this
would
be
a
perfect
addition
compliment
to
a
beef
stew
would
also
work
as
a
nice
base
for
a
black
and
tan
or
in
this
case
black
and
red
comments
a
hearty
ale
with
a
solid
dose
of
malt
with
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
i
would
try
again
but
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
as
their
12pack
packaging
does
not
indicate
a
bottling
date
this
makes
it
difficult
the
bottles
are
marked
but
not
the
outer
packaging
pure
malts
a
tinge
of
hot
alcohol
up
front
mixed
with
some
dark
ripe
fruit
and
a
touch
of
earth
12
pack
is
out
of
season
sporting
a
winter
warmer
but
this
is
tasty
a
straightforward
english
style
winter
warmer
drinkability
is
ok
but
this
is
not
what
is
advertised
pretty
weak
version
of
a
winter
warmer
just
no
solid
malt
backbone
or
hoppy
grit
id
call
it
a
slightly
above
average
amber
and
a
pretty
weak
strong
ale
a
nice
beer
its
another
micro
brewed
beer
trying
to
scratch
at
the
surface
of
the
craft
big
boys
without
offending
its
core
audience
beyond
that
a
nice
session
beer
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
having
again
i
thought
this
brew
was
well
crafted
and
tasty
its
not
a
big
beer
but
thats
fine
by
me
a
good
change
of
pace
as
a
session
seasonal
overall
a
pretty
decent
drinkable
beer
i
believe
this
is
my
first
boulder
beer
offering
even
while
living
in
denver
did
i
ever
try
any
of
their
products
anyways
a
nice
pour
from
this
beera
deep
rich
amber
with
12
finger
white
headaromas
were
malt
dominant
mainly
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
a
winter
warmer
in
its
big
sweetness
with
brown
sugar
really
hitting
strong
with
notes
of
caramel
and
spiced
cherry
the
hops
have
little
presence
with
a
light
drying
herbal
effect
in
the
finish
nice
flavors
but
i
think
it
could
be
a
little
cloying
after
one
or
two
and
generous
hops
per
the
bottle
were
not
therestill
a
decent
beer
very
nice
pour
with
a
medium
amber
hue
and
moderate
crown
a
few
streams
of
bubbles
rize
through
a
slightly
hazy
body
the
aroma
is
malty
but
very
faint
the
taste
is
somewhat
complex
a
strong
caramel
malt
presence
at
the
same
time
it
was
quite
hoppy
with
a
somewhat
bitter
but
long
finish
the
beer
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
medium
body
pours
a
dark
amber
cystal
clear
brew
with
a
rather
sticky
off
white
half
inch
head
with
good
lacing
and
rentention
aromas
are
mostly
the
caramel
sweet
malts
with
a
light
hopping
backbone
a
little
alcohol
is
detected
but
not
much
drinks
a
light
body
with
low
carbonation
a
very
balanced
brew
with
the
hops
and
malts
both
making
a
good
presence
to
me
its
like
an
amber
pale
ale
strong
ale
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
could
be
enjoyed
at
all
times
of
the
year
the
alcohol
and
hop
tinge
hits
you
a
bit
in
the
end
pleasant
nothing
stellar
the
body
is
a
bit
weak
somewhat
watery
but
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
nonetheless
would
pair
well
with
most
fast
foodesque
fair
this
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
an
average
tan
head
the
smell
is
bready
with
some
hopsbut
nothing
really
great
the
taste
has
a
sweet
maltnuttycarmel
flavor
thats
pretty
good
the
hop
presence
gives
this
a
slightly
bitter
aftertastebut
leaves
the
beer
with
malt
and
hop
flavors
very
well
balanced
this
is
a
tasty
brew
that
i
would
pick
up
again
its
tasty
enough
but
theres
tastier
beers
than
this
to
be
had
not
much
aroma
but
a
very
nice
color
taste
was
pretty
balanced
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
overall
i
liked
this
one
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
tried
from
boulder
based
on
this
one
ill
have
to
try
some
of
the
others
that
we
can
get
in
ct
the
website
says
that
a
secret
spice
is
added
but
i
cannot
really
taste
any
spice
maybe
ill
figure
it
out
by
the
time
i
finish
the
six
good
brew
overall
i
liked
it
i
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
of
a
smell
to
it
and
maybe
a
tad
more
body
di
like
this
one
not
a
lot
of
competing
flavors
but
a
nice
combo
of
caramel
malt
and
hops
i
think
i
will
have
another
one
or
two
served
up
at
fuel
and
fuddle
in
oakland
the
other
night
while
listening
to
the
saturday
night
special
don
zjak
playing
his
style
whiskey
blues
good
mix
of
everything
switching
it
up
between
his
ol
gibson
acoustic
and
fender
backed
by
his
boy
frank
george
on
the
sax
and
harmonica
now
that
i
set
the
mood
heres
this
seasonal
outta
colorado
appears
dark
caramel
amber
ruby
with
a
tan
two
finger
sized
head
leaves
even
amount
of
lace
aroma
contains
pine
cone
scented
hops
caramel
doughy
dosed
malt
backbone
taste
is
pretty
even
not
as
aggressively
hopped
as
the
label
claims
it
is
still
solid
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
the
pine
and
caramel
mix
to
form
a
nice
christmas
seasonal
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
evenly
carbonated
smooth
finish
goes
down
quite
nicely
drinkability
solid
hoppy
winter
warmer
not
my
favorite
for
the
season
but
definitely
a
beer
i
would
revisit
in
the
right
setting
poured
nice
amber
color
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
has
a
nice
smell
can
definitely
smell
the
hops
the
hops
definitely
are
out
front
in
the
taste
but
nice
malt
tastes
too
i
think
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
ale
i
would
buy
it
again
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
like
this
one
very
much
it
is
multidimensional
and
fullflavored
12
ounce
bottle
clear
copper
dense
beige
foamy

decent
lacing
carmel
malts
and
piney
floral
hops
in
the
nose
something
of
a
sweetish
spice
cinnamon
too
caramelly
malts
and
a
round
cinnamon
sweetness
followed
by
a
mildly
definitely
not
assertive
as
claims
the
label
piney
hop
bite
moderately
bitter
finish
slight
mineral
aftertaste
light
body
somewhat
juicy
mouthfeel
flavor
is
not
very
strong
for
a
strong
ale
at
least
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
dont
know
that
id
seek
this
out
again
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
1
tan
head
over
the
clear
dark
copper
brew
head
fades
slowly
with
heavy
fullcoating
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
malty
lightly
hoppy
kind
of
boring
for
a
strong
ale
taste
is
light
on
the
grains
then
the
fruit
and
hops
kick
in
a
bit
and
then
the
alcohol
comes
on
at
the
end
with
a
bitter
somewhat
detracting
aftertaste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
pretty
good
but
nothing
earthshattering
sonewhat
standard
strong
ale
here
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
just
a
touch
too
high
either
way
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
just
what
i
need
on
a
cold
winter
evening
another
good
one
in
the
looking
glass
series
from
boulder
give
it
a
try
this
could
be
a
session
beer
since
the
abv
tips
in
a
just
under
6
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
two
of
these
at
a
time
but
its
worth
a
shot
once
definitely
different
than
other
winter
beers
that
ive
had
but
nothing
groundbreaking
a
fair
choice
for
those
tired
of
the
more
common
seasonal
offerings
and
looking
to
expand
outward
a
bit
i
get
a
ton
of
malt
out
of
this
one
not
a
bad
sign
heavy
caramel
flavor
is
good
not
as
dark
as
most
of
the
winters
season
ales
out
there
that
part
i
liked
to
the
hops
dry
out
the
heavy
malt
to
add
a
really
good
balance
another
good
looking
glass
series
beer
pours
a
deep
clear
copper
amber
color
with
a
not
so
much
head
but
ok
lacing
smells
has
a
carmelized
malt
aroma
with
traces
of
hops
bordering
on
piney
tastes
like
winter
lots
of
malts
and
lots
of
hops
the
floral
hops
and
malts
are
pretty
well
balanced
and
finishes
a
little
bit
oily
with
traces
of
raisins
but
its
also
a
bit
skunky
maybe
because
its
a
llittle
old
so
i
might
be
compensating
a
little
because
i
can
tell
its
a
good
beer
but
dont
believe
what
im
tasting
is
intended
or
normal
even
so
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
pours
to
a
clear
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
toastiness
the
flavor
is
sweet
of
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
toasty
the
hops
are
light
in
the
flavor
it
is
lightmedium
in
body
and
easy
drinking
okay
but
nothing
too
good
not
bad
would
buy
again
next
year
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
head
and
lots
of
lacing
it
had
a
maltyfruity
smell
smell
is
weaknot
that
it
was
bad
mouthfeel
is
slightly
carbonated
but
not
too
light
if
you
like
the
hopped
ale
taste
this
is
your
beer
im
not
such
a
big
fan
of
thatbut
was
glad
i
tried
it
anyway
this
is
a
good
beer
but
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
an
aggressive
winter
seasonal
as
the
label
would
have
you
expect
its
easy
to
drink
and
has
few
faults
but
its
just
not
very
exciting
perhaps
it
shouldnt
be
the
body
is
limited
with
more
of
a
mid
moderate
feel
the
sweetness
helps
but
would
like
more
depth
there
is
a
slight
alcoholfusel
note
but
light
overall
a
good
beer
but
would
like
a
bit
more
complexity
dark
amber
with
aromas
of
sweet
malt
and
resiny
hops
malty
flavor
upfront
along
with
some
spices
cinammon
and
maybe
allspice
then
some
woody
hop
character
at
the
finish
surprisingly
light
bodied
for
a
beer
with
a
somewhat
festive
flavor
profile
overall
its
drinkable
stuff
but
nothing
too
spectacular
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
mild
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
toasted
caramel
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
light
and
slightly
warm
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
seasonal
beer
it
has
good
aroma
and
a
nice
malty
flavor
a
good
drinker
malt
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
too
with
a
spicy
caramel
taste
that
plays
well
off
of
some
of
the
citric
notes
in
the
hops
overall
though
its
a
bit
too
malty
for
me
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
especially
is
a
bit
thick
and
even
with
the
somewhat
interesting
nutmeg
spice
notes
i
dont
really
like
this
one
impression
a
nice
winter
beer
more
hoppy
than
most
but
that
is
my
preferrence
good
beer
for
the
money
nice
ruby
red
color
not
much
head
the
aroma
has
mostly
molasses
with
some
citric
hopiness
not
the
aggressive
hopiness
i
expected
from
the
bottle
description
the
taste
seems
mostly
malty
upfront
carmel
and
molasses
flavor
are
dominant
there
are
some
hops
in
the
finish
though
also
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
finish
medium
bodies
with
nice
carbonation
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
anything
too
special
i
could
drink
it
at
a
party
or
something
but
i
would
look
for
something
better
first
overall
a
respectable
brew
that
i
have
no
major
problems
with
although
id
recommend
others
over
it
as
my
native
coloradan
friend
who
is
contributing
to
this
review
says
this
is
a
very
typical
good
colorado
microbrew
everything
thats
good
about
colorado
microbrews
he
says
certainly
no
avery
say
i
but
i
like
it
it
has
a
smooth
quick
mouth
with
little
after
taste
just
a
slight
hop
bitterness
it
is
good
for
a
short
session
of
one
ore
two
beers
not
light
but
not
that
strong
either
overall
well
balanced
an
excellent

acton
ma
quite
nice
a
whiskey
drinker
might
think
of
this
as
a
jack
daniels
without
the
alcohol
content
the
body
is
smooth
man
this
beer
really
hits
the
spot
overall
very
nice
like
a
more
balanced
snca
with
darker
caramel
flavor
and
muted
flavor
and

hops
pleasantly
surprised
this
brew
is
a
deep
amberbrown
color
small
tan
head
on
the
top
thick
caramel
malt
scent
some
bitter
hop
undertones
the
taste
is
more
like
a
amber
ale
than
a
pa
caramel

front
some
decent
bittering
hop
in
the
finish
medium
mouth
like
i
said
i
would
call
this
an
amber
before
i
called
it
a
pa
overall
its
alright
but
nothing
amazing
reflection
if
your
looking
for
a
good
winter
seasonal
this
isnt
it
this
beer
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
way
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
maybe
some
hop
spiciness
from
an
oldcountry
variety
would
be
enough
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
as
a
winter
ale
this
is
one
wonderful
brew
im
not
much
of
a
correander
person
and
that
would
be
typical
of
many
winter
beers
this
isnt
like
that
instead
rockies
choice
of
flavors
makes
for
what
i
consider
the
most
enjoyable
winter
brew
i
have
experienced
kudos
not
a
bad
brew
here
just
not
one
id
buy
again
worth
a
six
pack
every
winter
just
not
worth
a
case
or
two
of
the
winter
seasonals
i
enjoy
more
poured
with
a
average
tannish
head
and
a
deep
amber
reddish
color
thick
syrupy
malsty
and
bready
aroma
with
some
alcohol
and
a
spicy
hop
aroma
light
body
and
mouthfeel
very
misleading
from
the
aroma
has
a
mild
chocolatly
note
and
some
decent
hop
character
more
toward
and
ipa
i
think
but
who
cares
very
drinkable
and
a
decent
beer
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
no
head
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
caramel
malts
and
a
subdued
hop
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
an
adequate
amount
of
hops
a
little
weak
in
the
hops
for
an
apa
but
still
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
a
very
nice
brew
poured
a
very
nice
amber
with
a
chunky
head
that
leaves
an
excellent
lacing
smell
is
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
invite
you
to
try
more
taste
is
likewise
a
blend
of
malt
and
hops
starts
sweet
on
the
front
palate
and
finishes
in
a
light
hop
finish
lends
an
overall
smoothness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
quality
lightly
slick
very
easy
on
the
palate
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
would
be
easy
to
have
more
than
one
thanks
to
clvand0
for
this
beer
it
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
no
real
head
the
nose
is
deep
caramel
malts
with
nice
earthy
hops
that
balance
well
with
it
the
flavor
is
nice
with
a
good
sweetness
to
balance
the
earthy
hop
better
than
other
apas
ive
had
recently
i
like
this
for
an
apa
most
tend
to
be
too
much
on
the
earthy
side
but
this
one
balances
well
between
sweet
and
earthy
the
feel
is
just
moderate
but
still
nice
i
would
want
just
a
hair
more
drinkability
is
also
good
on
this
one
all
around
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
had
in
a
while
never
summer
ale
a
great
name
and
a
great
label
is
a
tweener
and
deserves
some
credit
for
originality
it
comes
off
as
a
slightly
weaker
less
complex
hoppier
version
of
a
classic
winter
warmer
i
found
it
to
be
delicious
and
will
definitely
look
for
it
again
keep
an
eye
on
the
looking
glass
series
of
beers
from
boulder
the
two
that
ive
had
so
far
have
been
excellent
this
really
looked
like
a
strong
contender
at
first
but
then
faltered
leaving
the
starting
gate
and
never
got
back
on
its
feet
poured
a
radiant
garnet
nose
was
a
bit
sweet
with
modest
floral
hops
im
thinking
this
will
be
along
the
lines
of
sierra
nevada
celebration
ale
the
malt
was
insubstanital
failing
to
keep
the
promise
of
the
appearance
hopping
was
likewise
lacking
in
follow
through
on
the
aroma
overall
on
the
thin
side
with
some
acidic
notes
lackluster
verdict
a
winter
ale
for
florida
the
spices
while
noticeable
are
very
subdued
and
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
pronounced
flavor
but
despite
its
shortcomings
i
still
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
warmed
me
up
on
a
cold
winter
day
pours
a
mahogany
brown
color
with
sizable
tan
head
smell
is
sweet
with
floral
hops
and
spices
with
hints
of
cinammon
and
corriander
big
malt
presence
to
really
balance
out
this
beer
this
is
a
very
different
apa
if
it
turely
is
one
it
has
a
larger
malt
presence
and
a
spicier
flavor
on
top
of
the
normal
hoppiness
of
the
style
very
very
good
an
easytodrink
winter
beer
that
doesnt
beg
to
be
contemplated
2003
edition
cellared
for
8
months
or
so
pours
a
clear
rubytinted
chestnut
beneath
a
creamy
head
of
ivory
foam
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
nice
rings
of
craggy
lace
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
piney
and
citrusy
hops
ride
atop
a
delicate
caramelish
malt
in
the
aroma
the
body
is
medium
and
its
got
a
surprisingly
finebubbled
moderate
carbonation
that
lends
a
light
caress
to
the
tongue
before
allowing
it
to
fade
smoothly
away
the
hops
and
malt
indicated
by
the
nose
are
exactly
whats
found
in
the
flavor
theyre
wellentwined
and
work
almost
as
one
with
the
fruitiness
of
the
citrusy
hops
giving
a
bit
of
a
spark
to
its
otherwise
dry
slightly
molasseskissed
malt
piney
hop
flavor
and
a
bit
of
spice
appear
at
the
swallow
as
its
bitterness
steps
forward
it
finishes
dry
and
lingering
with
bitterness
pine
and
sublime
spice
a
decent
enough
holiday
or
winter
beer
thats
probably
worth
trying
overall
a
solid
offering
big
thanks
to
blatzman
for
the
bottle
i
was
really
suprised
with
the

this

of
a

a

anyway

but
not

for

thanks
to

for
this

offering
much
appreciated
the

poured
a

with
a
thin

that
dissipated
quickly
to
a

it
had
a
pleasing
sweet

smell
with
a
hints
of
spices
it
has
a
sweet
malt
start
with
a
spicy
hoppy
finish
the
tastes
are
well
balanced
the
palate
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
overall
a
nice

at

final
thoughts
part
of
a

this
was
not
the
most
enjoyable
beer
of
the
bunch
would
have
guessed
by
its

that
it
was

goes
smell
is
inticing
with
a
nice
mingling
of
dark

and
spicyherbal
hops
that
has
a
touch
of
pineyness
to
it
and
woodish
notes
taste
is
all
together
bland
and
characterless
lacks
depth
richness
and
above
all
taste
the
front
is
upheld
in
some
light
mild
maltyness
and
roasty
tones
thin
with
metallic
notes
the
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
which
were
nice
and
had
some
spicy
hints
and
pine
but
had
a
watery
taste
that
always
seemed
to
keep
getting
in
the
way
which
didnt
help
the
feel
at
all
very
thin
and
watery
theres
nothing
warming
or
assertively
hopped
as
it
states
about
it
its
got

thats
for
sure
assertively
nah
another
look
in
the

the

departs
the
12ounce
brown

a
deep
garnet
color
with
the
head
modest
creamy
in
texture
and
a
nice
light
tan
as
it
slowly
dissolves
the
lace
forms
a
tight
sheet
to
conceal
the
glass
malt
dominated
nose
just
a
hint
of
spice
fresh
clean
and
sweet
with
the
start
nicely
malted
and
lightly
sweet
top
was
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
which
detracts
much
just
not
enough
body
finish
is
well
hopped
spicy
and
pleasing
to
the
palate
very
dry
aftertaste
and
a
drinkable
brew
maybe
just
a
tad
above
average
if
it
only
had
more
body
something
seems
lacking
somewhat
bold
esp
in
the
hops
but
somehow
still
not
full
or
firm
enough
doesnt
get
smooth
enough
drinkable
but
doesnt
separate
itself
from
the
pack
the
looking
glass
series
hasnt
impressed
me
very
much
i
thought
that
since
this
was
in
their
looking
glass
series
it
would
be
a
bit
on
the
wilder
not
the
milder
side
and
i
was
wrong
not
a
bad
beer
very
drinkable
with
an
appreciable
taste
but
certainly
a
far
cry
from
what
i
was
thirsting
for
clear
deep
ruby
nice
looking
beer
a
bubbly
beige
head
laces
with
sufficiency
nose
is
spicy
dark
spices
and
spicy
hop
tones
add
some
dark
caramel
maltiness
and
you
have
an
inviting
nose
they
peg
this
beer
to
be
assertively
hopped
and
a
more
aggressive
winter
seasonal
i
beg
to
differ
this
isnt
bad
but
its
just
not
that
bold
the
underlying
dark
caramel
malts
lay
down
a
nice
maltiness
and
working
on
top
of
that
is
some
spicy
hops
somewhat
tasty
but
nothing
real
warming
about
this
one
a
good
try
but
not
one
of
the
big
boys
clear
dark
copper
color
yellowish
head
of
two
bubble
sizes
but
not
much
height
vertical
dot
and
string
lace
neutral
aroma
leans
toward
maple
syrup
with
some
black
pepper
background
mouthfeel
is
medium
as
is
carbonation
malt
is
heavy
on
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
some
black
cherry
but
hauled
back
by
floral
and
somewhat
ashy
hopping
hits
the
back
of
the
throat
thickly
with
a
little
bit
of
heat
overall
a
betterthanaverage
beer
but
a
little
too
tight
and
underspiced
for
my
expectations
came
off
almost
as
an
esb
clear
bronzyauburn
hue
the
slightly
offwhite
head
reached
a
very
modest
halffinger
in
height
before
fading
to
a
scummy
soapy
collar
rather
quickly
spotty
lace
looks
decent
enough
good
aromas
hoppy
with
pine
and
citrus
influences
malty
goodness
too
a
kiss
of
fruit
fair
potency
a
little
more
authority
would
be
welcomed
it
is
inviting
the
palate
is
pleasantly
hoppy
very
unexpected
actually
the
outright
bitterness
is
solid
but
the
hops
add
flavorful
depth
largely
piney
a
hint
of
citrus
that
can
be
found
squarely
on
top
of
the
sweet
slightly
toffeelike
malts
the
spiciness
is
mild
hot
candylike
this
is
a
mighty
tasty
beverage
and
yet
another
reason
to
take
note
of
the
looking
glass
series
mediumfull
body
modest
and
appropriate
carbonation
that
produces
a
pleasant
effortless
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
i
am
impressed
with
and
something
i
need
to
quaff
again
lovely
stuff
try
one
drinkability
a
good
winter
warmer
that
is
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
first
dud
in
the
looking
glass
series
of
beers
clear
blonde
hue
with
a
faint
murk
thin
but
dense
persistent
porcelain
white
head
leaves
diffuse
lace
soft
doughy
malt
accompanied
by
a
floral
hop
and
grainy
tart
wheat
combination
upfront
in
aroma
bated
hint
of
clove
phenol
and
honeyish
sweetness
add
an
herbally
sweet
contrast
unique
but
not
well
rounded
aromawise
transient
wash
of
white
bread
sweetness
incipient
on
flavor
is
ensued
by
a
drying
yet
lingering
suggestion
of
lightly
astringent
wheat
chaff
and
orange
pith
mellows
mid
palate
and
notes
of
underbaked
lemon
cookie
surface
to
provide
token
but
welcome
malt
character
lightly
bodied
with
a
functional
forgettable
mouthfeel
conducive
to
easy
quaffing
finishes
concomitantly
dry
metallic
and
tartly
citric
an
odd
brew
that
attempted
to
stand
out
from
the
typically
insipid
filtered
american
wheat
but
failed
never
summer
ale
is
a
decent
brew
overall
but
no
more
i
realize
now
that
this
is
a
winter
seasonal
this
could
be
much
better
fresh
alcohol
by
volume
5
94
this
turns
into
a
hop
drinker
more
and
more
as
the
glass
goes
down
at
68
ibu
that
should
come
as
no
shocker
its
certainly
an
interesting
arrangement
and
im
glad
i
got
a
bottle
it
doesnt
totally
assert
itself
but
doesnt
really
need
to
either
interesting
and
a
good
start
to
six
beer
minisession
i
had
that
evening
o
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
hybrid
of
a
black
ipa
and
a
winter
warmer
which
i
find
a
slightly
awkward
style
it
is
a
little
more
approachable
than
a
lot
of
other
winter
warmer
beers
as
it
is
less
sweet
and
not
as
intensely
spicy
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
little
easier
to
drink
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
and
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
black
ipa
not
a
beer
i
have
seen
before
but
one
i
will
seek
out
again
whenever
possible
overall
a
little
too
hoppy
for
the
style
but
drinkable
overall
this
beer
has
trouble
finding
an
identity
especially
as
a
winter
warmer
i
like
it
but
i
am
not
too
picky
o
good
beer
not
a
normal
winter
warmer
spicemalt
with
a
sweet
finish
the
hops
were
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
but
well
worth
it
every
chance
you
get
d
a
good
brew
to
drink
slowly
nothing
wild
was
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
a
good
simple
winter
warmer
overall
an
unexpectedly
hoppy
winter
warmer
while
unexpected
it
was
rather
nice
not
too
sweet
but
rather
balanced
overall
its
a
beer
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
o
its
strong
pine
and
hop
resin
characteristics
combined
with
the
malt
sweetness
make
it
a
great
beer
for
a
ski
lodge
or
a
cabin
but
compared
to
most
other
winter
warmers
ive
had
this
just
doesnt
compare
o
above
average
creamy
and
hoppy
overall
a
tasty
concoction
but
a
tad
overhopped
filling
leaves
no
room
for
other
better
beers
drinkability
well
id
think
it
was
too
heavy
but
its
not
huge
overall
at
only
6
6
its
actually
light
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
and
the
awesome
depth
and
complexity
ensures
you
want
more
than
one
love
it
this
is
a
rather
mediocre
beer
in
my
opinion
maybe
it
would
have
been
better
fresh
the
apple
characteristics
im
not
fond
and
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
is
one
dimensional
and
simplistic
ill
avoid
this
in
the
future
o
an
enjoyable
brew
just
seems
to
have
more
dark
alelike
characteristics
than
that
of
a
winter
warmer
to
me
overall
a
very
very
good
winter
warmer
offering
from
rogue
classic
rogue
flavors
but
stands
on
its
own
merit
flavors
are
bold
a
bit
too
much
pine
in
the
hop
for
my
liking
but
still
a
complex
aggressive
winter
warmer
notes
interesting
once
perhaps
not
again
out
of
a
bomber
this
beer
was
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
the
head
was
a
towering
cap
of
tan
foam
that
left
lacing
as
and
retained
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
piney
hops
some
herbal
notes
and
a
touch
of
leather
and
wood
the
flavors
were
similar
to
the
aroma
dominated
by
the
hoppy
elements
but
with
the
addition
of
some
biscuity
malt
that
came
through
one
the
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
appropriate
an
odd
beer
only
in
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
winter
warmer
but
came
off
more
like
an
ipa
if
it
had
been
sold
in
summer
as
an
ipa
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
o
i
really
enjoy
this
i
could
easily
see
me
having
this
again
during
some
ski
trip
or
even
during
the
holiday
season
while
i
dream
of
my
next
ski
vacation
a
nice
offering
from
rogue
while
i
havent
had
too
many
of
their
beers
at
this
point
i
can
already
feel
the
rogue
trademark
taste
in
this
one
i
also
like
that
they
used
some
proprietary
ingredients
in
this
one
well
done
this
beer
pours
very
dark
black
brown
with
reddish
hints
and
a
nice
tan
head
it
has
a
very
hoppy
nose
with
fruity
hops
and
a
crisp
bitterness
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
consisting
of
citrus
fruits
and
a
modest
astringency
to
it
it
has
a
strong
backing
of
caramel
malts
and
some
carafa
its
dark
and
smooth
yet
not
too
heavy
as
it
looked
quite
thick
this
is
a
unique
and
refreshing
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
i
do
however
disagree
that
this
is
a
winter
warmer
it
tastes
100
like
a
black
ipa
and
nothing
like
a
winter
warmer
no
complaints
about
that
being
that
black
ipas
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
a
solid
beer
very
similar
to
their
dads
helper
black
ipa
overall
solid
beer
from
rogue
and
a
good
22
to
enjoy
in
between
runs
too
very
hippy
and
flavorful
and
wish
the
bitterness
would
be
toned
down
just
a
tad
draught
mikro
this
one
pours
a
hazy
rubycoppery
color
there
was
a
tan
head
and
some
lacing
from
it
lots
of
grapefruit
hops
up
front
to
the
nose
some
other
citrus
not
much
else
making
it
through
the
taste
is
more
balanced
grapefruit
hops
up
front
with
a
medium
malt
body
behind
it
some
malt
sweetness
making
it
through
as
well
as
a
hint
of
nuttiness
and
maybe
some
chocolate
not
much
else
is
making
its
way
to
the
front
not
bad
o
though
ive
grown
to
love
hops
i
wish
they
did
not
completely
overpower
the
malts
o
pretty
hoppy
for
a
winter
warmer
but
the
malt
backbone
evens
out
the
hops
and
heat
making
this
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
by
rogue
in
some
time
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
is
a
little
hop
heavy
but
nothing
wrong
with
that
as
the
flavors
balance
out
in
the
end
o
i
didnt
particularly
enjoy
the
hops
used
more
of
a
citrus
taste
would
have
been
better
a
good
winter
warmer
easily
one
of
the
best
rogue
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
ok
brew
easy
to
drink
nice
hop
an
malt
profile
nothing
distinctive
but
tasty
just
the
same
o
decent
beer
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
interesting
take
on
a
winter
style
even
if
it
did
miss
a
bit
for
me
o
i
took
off
points
just
because
this
beer
isnt
a
true
winter
warmer
its
a
good
beer
just
not
what
it
claims
to
be
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
weird
beer
it
was
like
drinking
two
beers
at
the
same
time
the
malty
profile
and
hops
didnt
work
together
for
me
pours
a
deep
opaque
stoutlike
sable
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
some
average
lacing
aroma
is
seriously
hoppy
having
a
firm
evergreen
tone
like
freshcut
pine
wood
bold
flavor
has
considerable
hoppiness
and
some
bitterness
with
woody
and
earthy
notes
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
firmbodied
texture
is
fairly
fizzy
and
leaves
a
tingly
slightly
smoky
finish
go
mad
o
drink
it
rogue
makes
a
few
beers
i
dont
like
this
is
far
from
any
of
them
pours
dark
amber
brown
with
tall
foamy
tan
head
good
head
retention
and
lacing
hoppy
spicy
aroma
up
front
with
notes
of
pine
sap
and
flowers
this
is
backed
by
mellow
roasted
malts
with
some
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
tastewise
the
beer
opens
up
with
rather
aggressive
hops
but
quickly
becomes
more
subdued
with
more
malt
forward
flavors
hints
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
rich
bread
a
distinctive
nutty
aftertaste
provides
a
clean
smooth
finish
substantial
mouthfeel
thick
with
medium
body
pleasantly
bitter
with
good
balance
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
misses
the
mark
as
far
as
taste
goes
a
nice
surprise
of
hoppy
goodness
isnt
enough
to
make
up
for
the
unbalanced
feel
of
this
beer
good
not
must
have
o
pretty
uninspired
overall
although
not
a
terrible
choice
the
finishing
move
to
my
night
out
at
wb
it
pours
a
clear
dark
russet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
roasted
malts
very
light
leek
light
grapefruit
peel
and
light
mandarin
orange
the
taste
holds
notes
of
dark
caramel
very
light
leek
flowers
lightish
greens
and
grass
tastes
sorta
like
a
salad
whose
dressing
has
gone
downhill
slightly
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
kinda
sad
brew
one
thats
not
sure
what
it
wants
to
be
but
its
schizoid
nature
leads
to
subpar
tastes
and
whatnot
overall
i
really
love
this
beer
because
it
feels
spicy
and
more
of
what
i
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
its
got
that
spicy
bite
that
remind
me
of
winter
and
the
holidays
d
goes
down
pretty
well
this
is
one
to
have
on
hand
after
a
hard
days
work
not
something
to
have
as
a
treat
though
as
the
flavor
is
so
light
overall
a
great
unique
beer
although
it
doesnt
quite
match
up
with
what
i
would
consider
to
be
a
winter
warmer
its
great
nonetheless
dryish
caramel
all
around
butterscotch
reinforced
by
a
piney
hop
flavor
woah
there
at
the
finish
that
was
real
butterscotch
a
little
sweet
buttery
for
my
liking
appearance
was
dark
brown
with
ruby
red
hue
there
was
less
than
a
finger
of
head
with
no
retention
there
is
rye
bread
in
the
nose
and
some
mild
chocolate
upfront
in
the
taste
as
you
get
halfway
through
the
beer
the
hop
finish
really
begins
to
sneak
up
on
you
in
a
pleasant
way
d
easy
drinkability
but
this
brew
is
missing
a
lot
the
flavor
is
well
put
together
but
doesnt
follow
through
o
this
is
a
surprisingly
tasty
and
well
done
beer
an
interesting
take
on
the
winter
warmer
o
a
decent
beer
from
rouge
nice
beer
willing
to
pick
it
up
agiain
and
enjoying
ive
had
better
and
worse
both
from
rogue
and
from
this
style
i
was
hoping
the
deliciousness
of
amarillo
would
shine
through
a
bit
more
than
it
did
but
still
a
solid
brew
o
this
is
a
tasty
beer
really
complex
in
the
aroma
and
taste
hadnt
had
this
one
before
but
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
sweetness
to
it
but
mostly
had
an
earthy
spicy
aroma
going
on
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
hops
in
it
but
other
than
that
i
wasnt
able
to
really
get
much
else
from
it
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
but
nothing
that
really
made
me
excited
overall
i
think
id
like
to
check
out
this
beer
again
one
day
perhaps
the
flavors
will
be
better
for
me
on
a
second
attempt
o
hops
are
more
evident
in
the
aroma
than
the
taste
where
the
rich
malt
flavor
dominates
without
masking
the
hop
component
mogul
madness
is
a
smooth
and
delicious
brew
you
can
think
of
as
either
a
winter
warmer
or
a
brown
pa
in
any
case
very
flavorful
and
interesting
without
being
challenging
highly
recommended
year
around
o
nice
winter
beer
with
good
herbal
notes
which
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
pours
brown
with
red
highlights
and
no
real
head
when
it
came
to
my
table
smell
is
inviting
hops
up
front
with
citrus
notes
and
a
kick
of
pine
the
flavor
was
smooth
with
the
citrus
and
hops
up
front
followed
with
subtle
bitter
notes
the
hops
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
with
the
pine
a
medium
mouthfeel
beer
with
deep
flavor
but
not
very
complex
but
is
done
very
well
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
definitely
worth
checking
out
i
poured
gently
as
i
could
see
at
least
a
modicum
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
i
still
got
a
finger
of
deeptan
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
a
deep
rubyred
with
cola
highlights
beautiful
nose
was
like
chewing
on
pine
needles
as
one
wag
recently
said
to
me
har
wow
was
the
the
taste
gooood
wei
recently
postulated
on
the
pairing
of
girl
scout
cookies
and
beer
and
this
would
either
be
like
gilding
the
lily
to
the
thin
mints
or
a
perfect
accompaniment
it
was
mediumbodied
but
it
had
a
beautiful
marriage
of
chocolatecoffee
malt
and
wintergreen
hops
on
the
tongue
gott
dang
it
suddenly
struck
me
as
more
of
a
dessert
beer
like
in
lieu
of
a
grasshopper
but
samey
same
omfg
i
would
totally
lay
this
on
a
lotta
people
that
claim
not
to
like
hoppy
beers
phuckin
phenomenal
finish
was
clean
and
dry
like
a
deep
breath
on
the
mountains
try
some
today
the
rogue
chocolate
stout
is
out
of
this
world
and
over
the
top
chocolaty
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
alternative
that
you
can
stick
with
all
night
if
you
find
it
on
tap
d
i
think
this
would
be
good
for
a
glass
or
two
in
the
evening
sampled
on
march
7
2011
it
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
about
a
quarter
inch
of
longlasting
beige
head
roasted
malts
greet
the
nose
followed
swiftly
by
earthy
and
hoppy
sensations
and
a
little
inviting
yeast
the
body
falls
into
the
medium
range
bubbling
with
carbonation
the
taste
is
also
full
of
hop
and
earth
elements
and
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
satisfying
bitterness
a
well
balanced
tasty
brew
well
suited
for
winter
or
march
in
minnesota
dquite
drinkable
but
not
the
greatest
i
can
see
what
they
wanted
here
but
the
bitterness
is
out
of
balance
and
doesnt
work
as
well
as
it
could
a
deep
brown
root
beer
color
with
a
fair
tan
head
and
oodles
of
lacing
the
aroma
gives
me
a
sharp
cat
piss
overdose
with
a
touch
of
saltwater
peat
interesting
and
enticing
for
the
hop
lover
the
flavor
brings
lots
more
of
the
bitter
hop
theme
with
some
brown
bread
highlights
and
a
cool
evergreen
refreshment
its
fairly
effervescent
with
a
medium
light
body
and
nearly
resinous
feel
this
sure
does
not
come
off
as
your
typical
winter
warmer
but
its
hard
to
pin
down
maybe
a
simple
ipa
fair
drinkability
but
i
would
probably
prefer
a
hop
stoopid
still
very
decent
for
the
hop
head
sampled
ontap
at
gingerman
in
nyc
dark
hazed
infused
hue
with
slight
carbonation
evident
aroma
was
laden
with
malts
wellbalanced
by
a
minor
yet
noticeable
hop
presence
thick
rich
taste
with
an
equally
satiating
mouthfeel
rogue
consistently
churns
out
topquality
brews
although
i
cant
attest
to
this
being
one
of
their
finest
samples
it
was
a
solid
stab
at
the
style
nonetheless
somewhere
in
between
a
black
ipa
and
a
winter
warmer
although
the
genre
is
somewhat
vague
it
still
asserts
itself
as
an
ideal
wintertime
brew
d
nice
taste
and
balance
the
woodyness
slows
you
a
bit
overall
a
very
good
beer
from
rogue
as
usual
i
think
a
fresher
sample
would
have
been
better
drinkability
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
that
is
obtainable
the
hops
used
really
set
the
tone
for
a
beer
thats
rich
in
hop
flavor
yet
the
malt
on
the
backend
really
smooths
this
beer
out
at
6
6
abv
this
is
a
easy
drinker
that
can
be
a
good
session
beer
if
drank
in
moderation
a
very
good
beer
all
around
dark
brown
topped
by
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
pleasant
ring
of
lacing
a
hoppy
pine
lemon
aroma
a
hopforward
ale
with
notes
of
pine
lemon
mint
slight
resin
slight
tile
cleaner
a
brief
break
from
the
hops
allows
for
the
roastdark
malts
to
come
through
but
it
doesnt
stay
around
for
long
it
finishes
bitter
and
clean
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
medium
carbonation
i
respect
the
hop
aggressive
nature
of
this
winter
warmer
d
a
good
drinker
decent
drinkability
but
aftertaste
is
something
to
deal
with
in
all
honesty
rogue
needs
to
step
up
their
game
a
lot
of
their
beers
are
going
down
hill
stop
worrying
about
liquor
and
get
back
to
the
beers
good
beer
id
definatly
have
another
i
would
call
this
a
hop
warmer
or
winter
hoppy
its
not
the
malty
warm
brews
you
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
it
goes
in
the
same
vien
as
the
sn
celebration
but
i
think
the
celebration
is
better
balanced
this
one
has
a
nice
dark
ruby
red
color
and
godd
head
and
carbonation
aroma
is
pine
forest
and
hop
oil
again
all
i
am
getting
is
a
hop
bite
with
a
bitter
finish
its
still
a
good
beer
but
not
my
taste
for
a
winter
warmer
d
great
very
tasty
alcohol
not
apparent
but
it
feels
like
approx
7
overall
a
completely
average
example
of
the
style
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
mouthfeel
for
what
i
was
expecting
it
was
incredibly
creamy
catching
me
off
guard
but
still
pleasant
to
have
the
body
without
a
whole
lot
of
apparent
alcohol
d
drinkability
was
warming
dark
and
bitter
with
some
earthy
citrus
notes
that
gave
you
that
feel
of
the
mountain
a
decent
wintery
brew
perhaps
a
good
starter
after
a
long
day
on
the
slopes
before
moving
onto
the
stouts
and
barleywines
to
finish
the
job
mogul
madness
stands
out
from
the
winter
crowd
by
being
so
damn
drinkable
the
body
is
smooth
and
full
almost
creamy
with
fantastic
carbonation
alcohol
is
firmly
in
check
but
the
beer
still
buzzes
with
flavor
rogue
alludes
to
a
lot
of
disparate
beer
styles
but
ultimately
hits
much
closer
to
home
for
me
than
other
winter
warmers
i
consider
this
to
be
in
jubelale
territory
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
from
last
year
the
malt
profile
falls
a
little
flat
compared
to
your
average
winter
warmer
not
sure
if
that
was
the
intention
anyway
overall
it
seems
a
little
too
resinous
and
slick
for
me
this
beers
pours
a
dark
and
deep
amber
color
with
a
little
head
that
staed
throughout
has
a
light
smokey
smell
tastes
a
bit
smoked
starts
hoppy
but
not
too
much
finishes
a
bit
malty
very
unquie
nice
strong
taste
gives
it
a
nice
mouthfeel
flavor
lasts
on
your
palatee
for
a
while
overall
a
good
beer
very
unquie
very
enjoyable
maybe
too
much
hops
towards
a
double

yt
all
under
control

fruity

amarillo
and
rogue
farm
willamette
peachy
colour
with
fruit
bits
medium
plus
mouthfeel
not
for
everyone
but
complex
complement
with
food
d
this
beer
has
a
great
aroma
but
a
more
flat
flavor
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
dry
for
the
level
of
bitterness
that
is
left
lingering
on
the
palate
as
a
result
the
malt
richness
is
lost
and
the
beer
is
less
drinkable
than
it
could
be
still
it
is
a
nice
beer
and
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
chance
on
tap
at
kickbacks
gastropub
in
jax
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
exceptionally
thick
and
sticky
lacing
lines
the
glass
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
but
i
can
tell
from
the
smell
and
lacing
that
there
must
be
significant
hops
added
some
other
interesting
aromas
noted
but
not
sure
if
i
can
pick
out
anything
specific
the
amalgam
of
flavors
all
add
up
to
a
smell
unique
to
any
beer
ive
smelled
before
taste
is
also
difficult
to
describe
maybe
there
is
some
interesting
flavor
like
chamomile
dominating
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
but
interesting
and
certainly
unique
drinkability
not
something
i
would
drink
in
abundance
during
one
sitting
however
i
can
see
enjoying
it
more
during
the
cold
months
to
come
taste

and
one
of
the
winners
tonight
its
a
nice
winter
warmer
but
i
dont
see
anything
particularly
special
about
it
drank
in
jan
2010
good
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
after
beer
dinner
on
a
cool
for
me
at
least
spring
night
drinkability
a
great
example
of
a
winter
warmer
though
not
the
beer
i
needed
to
really
sell
me
on
the
style
completely
its
well
balanced
and
refined
i
just
wish
the
bitterness
of
the
taste
was
a
little
more
subdued
sure
these
guys
have
occasional
issues
with
packaging
and
pricing
but
the
final
product
is
incredibly
satisfying
much
more
often
than
not
mogul
madness
ale
isnt
bumpy
in
the
least
rather
its
a
smooth
and
delicious
descent
from
first
ounce
to
last
the
palette
adjusts
its
not
too
bad
poured
from
a
bomber
with
a
label
that
features
the
words
festive
and
lively
head
fades
quickly
but
very
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
color
is
some
combination
of
red
brick
auburn
burgundy
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
hops
plus
the
typical
winter
warmer
spices
taste
is
definitely
heavy
towards
the
hops
something
about
this
beer
reminds
me
of
christmas
and
santa
claus
i
cannot
explain
that
its
possible
thats
because
its
along
the
same
lines
as
sn
celebration
or
rogue
santas
private
reserve
but
for
me
this
one
falls
short
of
those
the
flavor
and
aftertaste
lack
a
little
balance
and
leaves
me
disappointed
after
the
intriguing
aroma
the
carbination
is
a
little
to
strong
for
me
and
this
wouldnt
fall
in
my
fav
list
i
still
love
rogue
and
you
should
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
beer
drinkability
its
solid
and
certainly
fine
for
at
least
a
pints
worth
a
robust
bitter
brew
for
the
winter
months
d
an
untraditional
representation
of
the
style
but
a
solid
winter
brew
nonetheless
good
malt
makeup
and
an
excellent
source
of
natural
spiciness
in
the
hop
blend
a
slightly
phenolic
taste
and
warming
effect
let
you
know
theres
a
little
kick
in
there
but
this
would
be
a
nice
bomber
to
have
on
hand
after
a
day
of
shoveling
or
snowboarding
originally
reviewed
on
03122010
065805
a
pretty
good
hoppy
ale
but
any
winter
warmer
characteristics
are
more
or
less
obfuscated
a
little
different
so
from
that
point
of
view
i
liked
it
much
more
hops
then
i
expect
from
winter
warmers
and
much
less
spice
so
i
may
be
a
little
generous
when
reviewing
for
style
but
hey
what
can
i
say
i
liked
this
beer
d
starts
out
fairly
well
but
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
the
dark
fruitplumprune
even
taste
just
became
too
overpowering
could
have
used
some
more
well
defined
hops
to
balance
it
out
it
was
an
ok
brew
but
i
dont
think
i
will
pick
it
up
again
yummy
but
subdued
malts
sugary
but
not
syrupy
hops
peel
away
the
malts
a
little
too
quickly
for
me
this
one
has
big
flavors
and
remains
really
enjoyable
not
a
session
beer
but
drinkable
enjoyable
some
people
can
get
behind
the
malt
bomb
and
hops
bomb
combined
into
one
but
its
not
my
favorite
thing
this
one
is
aided
by
a
slight
dryness
but
its
not
quite
enough
to
make
this
beer
deserving
of
my
recommendation
astringent
is
the
key
word
for
this
dark
hoppy
ale
you
get
it
coming
and
going
from
both
the
malt
and
the
hops
throughout
gets
a
bit
boring
after
a
while
cant
say
id
pick
up
another
one
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
metallic
flavor
throws
everything
off
and
detracts
from
the
quality
of
the
beer
we
arrived
at
the
eugene
city
brewery
and
just
happened
upon
the
brewer
here
at
this
fine
rogue
establishment
nate
showed
us
around
as
i
attempted
desperately
to
nurse
this
fine
ale
can
a
brown
thing
sparkle
i
feel
so
a
winter
warmer
maybe
an
ipa
not
quite
and
not
a
cda
no
indeed
not
somewhere
in
between
these
beers
lies
the
mogul
madness
a
deliciously
hopped
winter
ale
that
is
a
treat
to
the
northwest
and
indeed
anywhere
else
it
goes
grassiness
and
pines
like
imagining
what
lies
beneath
when
youre
trekking
with
giant
pads
beneath
your
feet
a
solid
body
and
an
amazing
finish
usually
im
a
rogue
hater
i
mean
i
dont
hate
rogue
i
just
wish
for
so
much
more
from
them
am
i
reconverted
once
again
i
had
the
rogue
flashback
with
this
beer
as
it
tasted
a
lot
like
sigs
northwestern
ale
in
that
is
a
dark
ale
with
lots
of
hops
and
the
typical
pac
man
yeast
decent
beer
as
most
rogues
are
but
nothing
special
or
memorable
i
liked
the
malty
backbone
and
the
finish
was
pretty
solid
but
it
didnt
rock
my
world
d
ok
drinkability
i
thought
it
needed
more
malts
to
round
out
the
beer
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
drinkability
i
am
not
a
fan
this
is
a
moderately
bitter
sipper
that
has
spices
that
are
less
pronounced
i
have
had
way
better
in
the
style
and
would
not
buy
it
again
for
the
price
impression
one
of
the
poorer
offerings
from
rogue
ive
tried
many
better
winter
warmers
not
thrilled
wont
buy
again
dnot
very
tasty
and
a
pretty
thin
body
i
dont
recommend
a
dark
brown
beer
with
red
highlights
thick
tan
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
nice
caramel
malt
aroma
with
a
hoppy
citric
aroma
lingering
in
the
background
the
taste
was
a
reversal
of
the
aroma
pronounced
grapefruit
with
a
small
malt
contribution
this
was
a
pretty
hoppy
beer
not
at
all
like
other
winter
warmers
i
have
tried
a
nice
winter
warmer
indeed
i
love
winter
warmers
that
lend
hop
spicing
rather
than
adjunct
spicing
and
still
keep
winter
maltiness
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
bitter
aroma
that
boasts
of
pale
roasted
and
crystal
malts
along
with
an
excellent
dose
of
hops
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
bone
dry
pale
and
roasted
malt
flavor
along
with
a
very
bitter
hop
taste
i
like
the
hop
component
but
it
takes
away
from
the
malt
character
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinker
as
far
as
winter
warmers
are
concerned
but
there
are
plenty
more
available
that
are
better
color
is
very
dark
brown
with
an
attractive
ivory
head
not
too
much
of
an
aroma
hops
brown
bread
taste
is
quite
nice
a
good
hop
punch
but
its
well
integrated
beer
is
substantial
but
not
at
all
heavy
nice
malt
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
nutmeg
good
depth
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
all
in
all
very
good
to
excellent
a
hoppy
complex
ale
while
this
isnt
the
best
beer
that
ive
had
from
rogue
its
probably
the
most
drinkable
of
their
offerings
that
ive
ever
tried
on
a
cold
night
like
this
its
a
welcome
change
from
the
darker
beers
that
fill
the
shelves
this
time
of
the
year
and
for
someone
trying
out
a
winter
seasonal
this
is
very
good
one
to
start
with
a
fantastic
beer
that
seems
similar
to
old
crustacean
just
a
tad
lighter
on
all
fronts
and
easier
to
drink
a
decent
brew
not
sure
i
would
spend
another
7
bucks
for
a
bomber
though
the
beer
pours
a
red
ruby
color
has
a
faint
nutty
smell
the
taste
is
a
smooth
yet
bitter
taste
and
has
the
feel
of
a
esb
the
drinkabilty
is
not
bad
but
not
overwhelming
either
had
two
pints
before
i
had
to
move
on
would
have
loved
another
d
hard
to
gauge
since
the
abv
is
unlisted
a
bitter
ale
that
doesnt
seem
to
pack
too
much
depth
that
being
said
it
is
smooth
and
drinks
nicely
like
a
thinner
less
malty
more
straightup
bitter
version
of
yakima
twilight
victorys
is
better
however
notes
a
very
good
looking
beer
that
is
way
too
bitter
for
me
dark
amber
body
nearly
opaque
cloudy
after
warming
discovered
this
wasnt
chill
haze
1
finger
tan
head
medium

bready
malts
a
bit
of
spice
cardamon
chocolate
coffee
and
very
complex
hop
profile
which
is
hard
to
deconstruct
taste
is
primarily
coffee
chocolate
bitter
hops
with
a
bit
of
plumlike
sweetness
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
great
mouthfeel
nicely
carbonated
not
too
syrupy
not
sessionable
but
a
nice
holiday
ale
well
worth
a
try
this
brew
pours
a
dark
amberred
colour
and
almost
looks
like
brown
creaming
soda
with
a
nice
two
finger
foamy
head
and
heaps
of
nice
lacing
around
the
glassthe
aromas
are
coffeeherbal
piney
hops
and
a
touch
of
kiwi
fruitit
has
a
weighty
mouthfeel
although
its
just
weighted
nicely
enough
to
easily
have
another
sip
after
another
with
tastes
of
pineyherbal
hops
the
first
thing
i
taste
followed
by
a
nicely
balanced
middle
body
of
carameltoffee
malts
that
really
smooths
out
the
tailend
of
this
beer
to
make
it
not
really
that
bitter
as
i
was
expecting
with
the
7
hops
that
they
have
used
i
was
expecting
a
big
bitter
bomb
right
at
the
end
but
not
at
all
and
to
be
quite
honest
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
balanced
beers
that
i
have
had
and
if
you
come
across
this
brew
i
highly
recommend
you
buy
a
few
of
them
as
im
going
back
to
my
bottleshop
tomorrow
to
buy
moredefinately
a
top
class
beer
d
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
winter
warmer
but
i
enjoyed
the
coffee
and
chocolatemocha
wouldnt
call
it
a
winter
warmer
so
much
maybe
strong
ale
nothing
yells
winter
or
warmer
at
me
the
name
for
this
beer
has
been
used
multiple
times
by
rogue
for
other
beersthis
incarnation
is
quite
good
poured

its

d
a
great

of
a
winter
warmer
though
not
the
beer
i
needed
to
really
sell
me
on
the
style
completely
its
well
balanced
and
refined
i
just
wish
the
bitterness
of
the
taste
was
a
little
more
subdued
overall
very
nicely
done
and
certainly
a
welcomed

treat
extremely
solid
and
drinkable

with
lots

might
pick

but
wouldnt

the
way
good
brew
enjoyable
and
balanced
about
right
for
a
cold
snowy
night
in
cleveland
not
a
bad
beer
dont
know
why
these
rogue
ales
are
so
expensive
they
are
quite
competent
yet
never
best
of
their
class
a
decent
beer
overall
a
vibrant
and
fresh
winter
warmer
very
nice
edit
bought
another
bomber
this
one
really
grows
on
you
bumped
up
the

number
overall
its
an
ok
beer
like
pretty
much
all
winter
warmers
its
nothing
amazing
nor
terrible
if
you
like
winter
warmers
it
might
be
your
thing

id
buy
it

something
id
get

about
a

whereas
many
winter
warmer
beers
play
up
the
sweetness
and
try
to
stay
cuddly
and
friendly
this
take
is
definitely
aggressive
and
forces
you
to
take
it
on
its
own
terms
me
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
overall
a
very
nice
winter
brew
ontap
at
woodys
city
market
served
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
a
decent
lighttan
head
aroma
is
pine

and
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
burnt
caramel
burnt
toast
and
bitter
pine
hops
paired
with
that
distinctive
pacman
yeast
characteristic
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
i
must
admit
being
from
north
carolina
i
hold
all
winter
warmers
to
the
standard
set
by
highland
cold
mountain
winter
and
while
the
style
had
a
wide
range
this
one
is
likely
the
best
on
ive
had
thats
on
the
hoppy
side
d
high
one
is
more
than
enough
but
i
really
really
really
like
this
beer
i
will
buy
some
more
congrats
rogue
this
beer
is
a
home
run
d
pretty
drinkable
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
winter
brew
and
again
i
cant
say
this
enough
it
stands
out
way
ahead
of
the
others
that
are
just
a
basic
porter
with
a
scoop
of
dirt
shoveled
in
credit
to
rogue
for
perfecting
this
and
bottling
it
a
beautiful
warmer
start
to
finish
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
in
this
category
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
little
cloudiness
and
formed
a
two
finger
head
feels
nice
with
a
little
alcohol
bite
finishes
smooth
a
lot
smoother
than
the
front
end
would
suggest
you
first
taste
dark
malt
with
a
sweet
finish
of
brown
sugar
for
a
minute
i
thought
it
was
a
brown
ale
overall
im
very
pleased
with
shipyards
take
on
this
very
good
beer
for
a
style
thats
sometimes
overlooked
great
beer
well
done
shipyard
medium
bodied
lightly
effervesced
no
warming
though
o
i
was
wildly
disappointed
in
this
brew
given
the
ratings
and
despite
the
freshness
date
being
quite
a
ways
out
in
the
future
i
cant
help
but
think
something
happened
to
the
batch
i
picked
up
i
will
have
to
revisit
again
next
year
to
hopefully
revise
tried
last
night
taste
like
a
smithwicks
but
much
more
flavorful
this
beautiful
looking
full
bodied
malty
masterpiece
pours
a
gorgeous
amber
brown
and
falls
into
the
hearty
ale
category
it
would
pair
perfectly
with
a
twice
baked
potato
and
a
thick
juicy
steak
yet
another
success
story
from
shipyard
brewing
co
not
as
spiced
as
some
which
is
a
good
thing
sometimes
malty
really
enjoyed
and
would
have
more
overall
it
was
a
nice
winter
beer
that
did
not
have
the
excessive
spices
that
ruin
some
winter
ales
good
but
not
one
id
seek
out
or
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
as
this
style
is
one
i
seem
to
only
have
because
its
winter
and
its
there
o
great
winter
warmer
overall
this
is
an
ok
brew
good
for
warming
up
on
a
cold
snowy
day
o
decent
beer
the
aroma
is
very
nice
but
flavor
does
not
follow
up
the
taste
has
a
slightly
more
bitter
after
effect
than
the
aroma
might
suggest
but
the
caramel
and
holiday
spices
punch
it
up
a
bit
i
am
a
fan
of
shipyard
brews
and
i
look
forward
to
this
one
each
year
i
cant
believe
i
had
not
reviewed
it
until
2013
o
this
has
some
of
the
traditional
flavors
of
an
old
or
strong
ale
but
the
abv
and
esters
are
more
muted
very
drinkable
especially
in
colder
weather
or
as
a
nightcap
poured
from
twistoff
bottle
into
becker
pint
glass
pours
deep
garnet
red
with
a
thin
cap
of
loose
foam
that
fades
quickly
to
a
loose
rim
of
bubbles
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
vinegar
upon
a
second
examination
as
it
warms
i
can
tell
that
that
smell
is
more
butterscotch
taste
is
strong
sweet
malts
surprisingly
a
bit
boozy
for
the
relatively
low
at
least
compared
to
other
stronger
beers
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
coupled
with
leftover
spiciness
not
sure
if
i
enjoy
this
style
but
itd
definitely
be
more
enjoyable
on
a
cold
winter
night

it
wouldnt

my
first

simply
fantastic
one
of
the
if

the
best

i
can

in

drew

in

there
wasnt
really
anything
in
this
beer
that
kept
me
interested
the
buttery
taste
for
me
was
not
a
positive
characteristic
of
this
beer
i
think
its
worth
buying
once
to
experience
as
im
sure
other
people
would
find
this
beer
good
o
this
is
good
but
i
wish
it
was
a

bigger
it
almost
teases
me
in
the
sense
of
a
old
ale
but
tuned
down
for
a
decent

for
the
customer
nice
price
and
easy

bit
nothing
to
brag
about
boring
beer
for
the
most

this

i

id
seek
it
out
again

really
like
the
taste
of
this

i
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
it
is
actually
a
very
tasty
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
representations
of
the
style
ive
had
better
winter
warmers
but
i
am
by
no
means
bashing
shipyard
as
they
produce
many
high
quality
beers
i
do
enjoy
a
winter
warmer
every
now
and
again
but
as
much
as
i
enjoy
shipyards
beers
i
believe
ill
stay
clear
of
this
one
unless
no
other
viable
option
is
available
not
a
bad
beer
it
had
its
moments
id
probably
try
it
again
on
a
cold
winter
day
on
the
east
coast
o
theres
a
welcome
thing
or
two
that
keep
this
from
being
totally
bland
but
there
isnt
enough
of
interest
here
for
me
to
buy
it
again
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
12
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasty
malt
toasted
nuts
and
some
caramel
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
and
nuts
caramel
and
some
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
slightly
medicinal
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
like
the
way
it
smells
more
than
the
way
it
tastes
d
good
one
to
try
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
winter
warmers
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
the
spices
were
there
but
not
over
the
top
it
was
sweet
but
not
overly
so
im
bordering
on
actually
seeking
this
beer
out
next
year
would
be
great
for
christmas
time
o
a
different
tasting
beer
the
spices
arent
anything
i
can
place
not
quite
appealing
to
me
but
i
can
see
how
it
might
appeal
to
others
tastes
from
a
22
oz
bottle
no
indication
of
bottling
date
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
not
terribly
complex
but
very
drinkable
overall
alright
but
nothing
really
too
special
for
a
winter
brew
as
the
taste
is
a
little
lacking
o
this
beer
isnt
as
complex
as
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
style
but
the
flavors
begin
to
develop
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
which
makes
this
easy
to
drink
poured
a
roasted
nut

with
a
tinge
of
burnt

and
even
a

on
the

light

with
some
vanilla
and

qualities
in
the
back
end
i
tried
this
a
few
years
back
and
i
dont
recall
liking
it
as
much
as
i
do
nowits
a
solid
well
rounded
winter
warmer
that
is
not
overly
spiced
andor
sweet
and
of
course
the
beer
may
have
been
easier
to
drink
had
it
been
either
a
little
more
sparkling
or
creamy
poured
a
1
beige
fine

head
very
deep
clear
amber

verging
on

smell
is
malt
but
not
much
else
taste
again
has
malt
and
seems
to
me
to
have
spices
such
as
nutmeg
though
others
didnt
reference
that
has
a
hint
of
banana
esthers
good
interesting
but
not
particularly
a
standout
o
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
its
a
cold
rain
outside
tonight
and
this
beer
is
living
up
to
the
style
of
winter
warmer
i
will
probably
buy
this
again
its
good
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
wouldnt
rush
back
o
very
good
heavy
great
seasonal
maybe
my
favorite
shipyard
seems
very
englishif
that
makes
any
sense
o
this
needs
improvement
tone
down
the
carbonation
and
youre
halfway
there
not
good
not
bad
oddont
love
the
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
legit
probably
my
favorite
so
far
i
enjoy
the
hops
its
a
bit
paler
than
others
i
have
tried
and
i
also
enjoy
that
probably
one
of
shipyards
best
beers
o
a
very
nice
beer
and
something
that
i
might
buy
again
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweet
flavors
as
well
as
the
fact
that
there
was
a
pleasant
hoppy
bitterness
to
balance
it
all
out
o
so
shipyard
makes
a
decent
winter
warmer
check
ill
come
back
to
this
o
descent
winter
warmer
i
had
higher
hopes
for
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
but
it
wasnt
bad
o
tasty
beer
not
a
style
that
i
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
but
sure
i
will
have
more
over
the
next
few
months
descent
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
a
good
starting
point
for
a
winter
brew
d
the
first
craft
beer
that
i
fell
in
love
with
too
heavy
and
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
od
not
knowing
what
to
expect
from
this
style
i
must
say
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
the
dwindling
supply
in
my
fridge
prompted
me
to
say
mmm
that
sounds
good
i
think
ill
have
that
and
im
glad
i
finally
did
nicely
suited
to
a
chilly
day
this
style
makes
the
knowledge
of
the
inevitable
winter
freeze
almost
tolerable
a
thank
you
to
duff27
do
i
can
understand
why
this
would
be
a
polarizing
beer
drank
out
of
season
but
im
sure
its
held
up
nonetheless
nothing
gone
wrong
about
it
would
have
again
in
the
future
but
probably
not
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
ogood
beer
for
shipyard
decent
warmer
but
there
are
so
many
better
ones
out
there
id
like
to
see
this
a
bit
more
aggressively
spiced
mouthfeel
started
out
ok
but
what
i
seem
to
run
into
time
and
again
with
these
overly
malty
beers
is
an
odd
finish
with
the
maltiness
not
leaving
me
wanting
another
sip
more
likely
the
issue
is
with
the
combbo
of
yeasthopsmalts
that
makes
up
this
brew
along
with
whatever
else
they
do
to
it
it
will
not
make
it
to
my
repeat
list
but
maybe
i
would
feel
more
favorable
to
it
in
the
correct
season
maybe
i
can
pawn
these
off
on
my
son
light
to
medium
body
with
some
soft
carbonation
that
helps
stimulate
the
taste
buds
pretty
light
for
a
winter
warmer
in
terms
of
body
and
alcohol
content
wow
very
nice
winter
warmer
a
truly
sessionable
brew
at
nearly
7
alcohol
nice
flavor
profiles
malts
in
the
middle
hops
in
the
end
lots
of
flavors
and
lots
of
goodness
here
case
worthy
stuff
i
have
only
had
a
few
from
shipyard
i
suspect
this
may
be
their
best
offering
drinkability
i
like
the
malty
side
more
than
the
hoppy
side
of
this
one
overall
overall
the
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
the
beer
has
a
great
smell
and
nice
complex
flavor
that
moves
from
roasted
flavor
to
a
sweeter
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
beer
prelude
special
ale
despite
not
being
special
beer
is
one
of
sbcs
better
efforts
a
better
mouthfeel
would
not
have
increased
the
scores
on
either
side
of
it
but
it
would
have
made
this
a
more
enjoyable
experience
worth
a
single
each
winter
great
for
winter
warming
and
satisfying
without
being
overbearing
excellent
winter
great
price
hits
the
spot
every
time
full
flavor
but
still
sessionable
ending
notes
i
was
actually
impressed
with
this
brew
from
shipyard
very
nice
balance
its
a
great
beer
to
warm
up
with
on
a
winter
night
after
working
all
day
long
quite
enjoyable
i
would
get
this
one
again
this
may
be
the
best
of
the
style
ive
tried
and
my
new
goto
winter
warmer
12oz

no
freshness

definitely
the
2010
batch
pours
a
translucent
mahogany
with
a
loose
quarter
inch
tancolored
head
head
dissipates
into
a
consistent
skim
across
the
surface
some
swaths
of
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
nose
is
nutty
and
somewhat
consistent
with
an
english
nut
brown
however
theres
also
a
trace
of
skunk
and
some
caramel
and
toffee
notes
taste
follows
nose
skunky
quality
is
a
little
more
forthcoming
in
the
flavor
profile
theres
also
a
trace
of
spice
in
the
mix
perhaps
nutmeg
as
well
as
another
quality
i
cant
quite
tease
out
maybe
some
form
of
dark
fruit
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
consistent
carbonation
some
creaminess
and
a
slight
acidity
the
skunk
to
this
beer
really
kills
it
for
me
i
can
drink
maybe
one
in
a
sitting
and
its
not
terrible
but
that
off
flavor
hangs
around
not
something
i
need
to
revisit
anytime
soon
md
medium
bodied
but
on
the
thicker
side
overall
pretty
good
the
only
thing
it
has
going
against
it
was
the
presence
of
the
alcohol
i
like
a
little
bit
of
heat
in
my
winter
warmers
but
a
little
less
here
would
have
done
the
trick
for
me
some
nice
flavors
and
a
solid
beer
d
ive
sessioned
this
beer
more
than
a
few
times
drink
a
sixer
and
youll
be
gone
for
the
night
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
big
time
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
superb
brew
here
very
interesting
tastecomplexity
throughout
very
drinkable
this
suprised
me
has
beginnings
of
a
malty

brown
but
shows
some
hops
in
the
finish

dark

some

well

great
winter
brew
not
bad
but
clearly
not
one
of
my
favorites
revision
having
read
other
review
that
mention
chocolate
and
an
earthy
quality
to
the
hop
bitterness
i
would
have
to
agree
though
the
chocolate
is
verrrry
subtle
and
only
on
the
tail
end
of
the
transition
i
would
also
say
that
what
i
mistook
for
vanilla
and
caramel
in
the
bouquet
may
actually
be
more
like
butterscotch
12oz
shipyards
prelude
into
delirium
tremens
globe
pours
a
dark
auburn
shade
with
a
cool
light
tan
head
smells
danky
with
spicy
notes
barely
shinning
through
such
as
cinnamon
and
a
tad
of
ginger
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lace
on
the
walls
of
this
glass
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
60l
and
roasted
malt
and
a
slight
bit
of
spice
not
too
much
hops
to
speak
of
here
but
most
likely
willamette
this
brew
is
somewhat
a
complex
drink
to
ponder
on
i
feel
like
its
a
tougher
one
to
figure
out
because
not
really
anything
is
pronounce
or
obvious
in
this
brew
everything
melds
together
really
nice
here
overall
i
used
to
love
this
brew
alot
but
it
seems
like
it
has
changed
since
the
unavailability
down
here
in
georgia
in
09
its
a
cool
beer
to
share
with
others
that
truly
have
an
appreciation
for
this
style
merry
christmas
and
cheers
to
all
update
had
this
in
a
growler
from
the
kennebunkport
brewery
as
well
and
the
flavors
were
really
fresh
my
first
bottle
was
aged
a
year
both
were
good
but
i
would
recommend
having
it
fresh
drinks
alright
but
doesnt
quite
pull
together
for
me
beer
is
not
as
good
as
the
appearance
scent
would
lead
me
to
believe
not
bad
i
would
drink
one
or
two
if
offered
but
fairly
middling
as
winter
warmers
go
imo
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
chewy
but
not
too
heavy
overall
this
is
a
classic
example
of
what
a
winter
warmer
should
be
and
certainly
one
of
shipyards
best
d
i
could
put
down
a
few
if
i
didnt
let
them
warm
up
too
much
definitely
a
good
brew
for
a
cloudy
cold
december
day
bought
a
six
pack
for
the
holiday
beautiful
amber
color
with
patchy
lacing
on
the
sides
and
medium
sized
head
that
dissipates
after
a
bit
the
aromas
were
fantastic
malt
ginger
roasted
spices
sugar
molasses
and
so
much
more
definitely
a
top
aroma
winner
for
me
the
taste
represented
the
sweet
tastes
with
a
heavy
malt
flavor
really
nice
and
dry
aftertaste
the
drink
definitely
had
a
clean
and
crisp
mouthfeel
to
it
overall
a
fantastic
seasonal
dpleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
was
very
good
and
i
could
easily
have
a
few
more
an
interesting
warmer
nice
dark
brown
with
not
much
head
aroma
is
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
flavor
follows
thru
with
big
malty
flavors
and
nice
hints
of
cloves
and
dark
fruit
but
also
a
nice
bitterness
that
lingers
at
the
end
sometimes
warmers
can
be
overheavy
but
this
one
cleans
the
palate
at
the
end
and
keeps
you
sipping
a
very
nice
twist
on
this
style
well
it
is
winter
but
i
dont
exactly
call
68
degrees
cold
but
for
here
it
is
need
some
warmer
so
lets
give
this
one
a
whirl
poping
the
top
this
brew
smells
very
sweet
and
malty
a
little
bit
of
molasses
and
slight
hint
of
butterscotch
pours
into
my
trusty
testing
glass
to
an
orange
brown
with
a
beige
multisize
bubble
head
taste
is
well
balanced
and
delicious
taste
starts
with
a
big
sweet
malt
backbone
balanced
with
some
zesty
more
than
bitter
hops
in
the
middle
the
taste
is
a
little
more
bitter
and
bitterness
builds
into
the
end
the
aftertaste
is
a
flat
bitterness
with
a
lingering
malt
base
the
6
8abv
is
not
really
noticeable
except
for
the
fact
that
it
does
indeed
deliver
on
the
warmth
factor
a
tasty
brew
that
delivers
as
promised
and
an
incredible
bang
for
the
buck
compared
to
alot
of
similar
but
overpriced
craft
brews
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
well
carbonated
med
to
full
slightly
creamy
and
sticky
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
abv
is
present
throughout
slightly
in
the
nose
and
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
a
light
and
goes
down
real
well
expecting
a
beer
is
a
big
heavy
feel
but
was
welcomed
by
a
beer
that
does
not
push
you
over
the
top
a
very
mellow
and
interesting
beer
this
is
probably
one
of
the
more
drinkable
shipyard
beers
neither
overspiced
nor
too
strong
to
enjoy
2
or
3
bottles
a
six
pack
could
be
split
between
two
people
for
an
enjoyable
evening
of
drinking
this
is
one
winter
seasonal
i
always
make
sure
to
get
a
6
pick
of
a
tradition
ive
had
since
i
discovered
craft
beer
this
beer
will
also
keep
well
for
68
months
it
a
great
one
to
brake
out
midsummer
for
a
cool
taste
of
winter
during
a
heatwave
d
pretty
drinkable
it
was
a
bit
hot
feeling
but
the
flavor
was
complex
and
interesting
verdict
a
nice
prelude
to
any
evening
d
very
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
complex
better
than
i
expected
overall
i
was
surprised
with
this
one
i
am
typically
disappointed
by
shipyard
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
a
really
nice
body
lots
of
complex
flavors
blended
well
and
didnt
go
over
the
top
it
did
drink
a
little
hot
though
especially
for
under
7
prelude
has
a
lot
of
stuff
going
on
in
it
and
the
layers
of
sweetness
come
together
very
nicely
i
suggest
drinking
it
at
around
room
temperature
as
winter
warmers
go
prelude
is
a
good
one
i
would
have
liked
more
spicing
in
this
one
to
make
it
a
little
more
complex
and
inviting
but
the
incredible
malt
character
makes
this
one
a
winner
mouthfeel
beer
gets
better
throughout
pick
up
on
some
flavors
that
defy
description
on
the
palate
intriguing
recommend
d
not
a
bad
option
and
quite
nice
for
a
shipyard
brew
overall
creamy
and
malty
went
down
well
on
a
cold
snowy
night
good
drinkability
on
a
nice
winter
beer
d
this
is
a
full
flavored
winter
warmer
nicely
balanced
with
great
malty
flavor
but
enough
hops
to
give
it
a
little
bite
i
was
suprised
by
this
one
it
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
great
brew
from
shipyard
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
but
overall
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
a
pint
is
enough
imho
d
it
seems
easy
to
throw
this
one
back
so
ten
to
twelve
shouldnt
be
a
problem
this
however
should
not
be
mistaken
for
high
quality
as
i
was
not
too
impressed
a
nice
malty
sweet
but
not
cloying
or
sticky
sipper
it
pours
out
a
darker
amber
light
brown
color
with
a
tan
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
butterscotch
caramel
and
molasses
hitting
you
up
front
with
some
winter
spices
the
taste
is
much
milder
and
malty
then
you
expect
there
is
a
nice
hint
of
alcohol
to
complement
the
spices
and
the
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
with
some
bitterness
to
balance
it
all
out
this
is
a
hearty
beer
in
your
mouth
and
could
work
excellent
with
some
food
its
also
very
sessionable
it
goes
down
easy
and
isnt
overly
spiced
it
comes
in
with
an
abv
of
6
8
which
makes
it
good
for
a
winter
day
or
evening
of
drinking
with
friends
shipyard
did
a
great
job
with
this
winter
warmer
d
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
not
mind
purchasing
again
the
drinkability
is
great
despite
the
almost
7
abv
definitely
recommended
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
that
can
come
off
a
bit
strong
and
has
a
slightly
offensive
taste
upfront
d
nice
going
down
and
easy
to
repeat
no
over
spice
or
too
powerful
of
flavors
shipyard
does
it
right
on
this
winter
warmer
a
nicely
balanced
beer
with
some
interesting
and
complex
flavors
too
pours
a
crystal
clear
garnet
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
leaves
light
rings
of
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
clove
and
other
spices
nice
very
sweet
malt
up
front
caramel
with
some
chocolate
in
the
middle
then
the
finish
has
a
very
bitter
lemon
like
the
pith
not
the
rind
and
the
spices
come
in
to
overpower
light
carbonaiton
medium
body
with
a
chalky
mouthfeel
with
a
solid
dry
finish
looks
smells
and
starts
out
good
but
the
finish
ruins
the
drinkability
in
this
one
not
balanced
at
all
the
perfect
winter
almost
session
beer
a
clean
amber
ale
this
one
begins
with
a
warm
and
comfortable
aroma
of
clove
and
spice
the
taste
reflects
this
with
a
strong
spicy
palate
and
smooth
malty
inclination
unfortunately
theres
little
residual
complexity
the
sweetness
is
overpowering
rendering
this
beer
decent
but
not
outstanding
this
one
poured
into
a
pint
glass
slightly
cooled
is
a
deep
dark
copper
colored
brew
with
a
big
bumpy
oatmeal
colored
head
and
tons
of
chunky
lacing
i
smell
subtle
evergreen
cinnamon
and
very
light
malt
i
taste
some
resinous
malt
and
sweet
herbal
hop
very
nicely
balanced
with
fine
carbonation
quite
drinkable
id
call
this
solidly
midbodied
the
evergreenjuniper
notes
speak
softly
but
work
nicely
to
define
the
style
a
very
enjoyable
holiday
choice
this
beer
also
has
a
lot
of
meaning
for
me
two
years
ago
my
late
wife
and
i
went
to
the
prelude
celebration
in
maine
and
we
had
a
great
time
and
had
planned
to
return
i
knew
shipyard
brew
an
ale
for
this
celebration
and
only
very
recently
did
i
find
out
that
they
bottled
it
but
i
never
saw
it
for
sale
in
nj
on
christmas
eve
i
was
in
my
new
favorite
beer
store
and
there
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
just
delivered
were
4
cases
of
prelude
was
not
even
in
their
computer
when
i
grabbed
a
6
this
started
off
my
sons
and
mine
sober
celebration
a
small
christmas
miricale
normally
not
a
fan
of
shipyard
but
this
one
changed
my
mind
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
dark
auburn
color
wonderful
head
and
lacing
woody
and
spiced
smell
taste
was
perfect
for
a
winter
beer
plenty
of
spices
that
we
all
recognize
from
a
winter
warmer
but
just
enough
to
taste
but
not
overwhelm
a
perfect
balance
of
flavor
and
restraint
hearty
on
the
palate
but
smooth
to
drink
would
never
guess
it
was
6
8
best
winter
beer
of
2009
so
far
for
me
after
the
six
pack
was
done
we
went
out
and
bought
a
12
pack
because
we
liked
it
so
much
thank
you
shipyard
for
nailing
this
one
flavor
abound
great
drinkability
for
an
ale
of
this
genre
and
all
the
other
aspects
are
in
check
here
this
ones
worth
checking
out
im
not
sure
why
i
havent
had
this
beer
more
often
it
is
simply
damn
good
very
much
an
english
stle
almost
caskish
tasting
winter
warmer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
a
tasty
one
at
that
this
was
my
first
winter
warmer
and
it
was
a
solid
one
at
that
im
a
fan
of
drinking
my
beers
more
on
the
cold
side
this
one
got
better
and
better
as
it
warmed
the
next
i
drink
ill
let
it
sit
out
a
bit
before
i
open
and
pour
poured
a
brownish
body
with
red
tints
with
huge
head
and
lace
patches
had
a
sweet
smell
with
some
caramel
and
butterscotch
as
well
as
some
dry
malts
and
a
little
springy
hops
a
smooth
body
with
some
spices
to
match
the
sweetness
and
goes
down
in
a
medium
creamy
body
malts
are
mostly
caramel
with
some
toffee
and
some
spices
like
cinnamon
that
kick
it
up
and
it
finishes
clean
and
dry
thanks
to
spice
and
hop
little
bit
of
fruit
flavor
from
hops
but
not
much
this
is
a
good
beer
but
something
about
it
seemed
a
tad
off
to
me
d
would
enjoy
more
than
one
a
nice
beer
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
beer
and
definatley
a
winner
from
shipyard
very
much
the
anti
sweet
and
heavily
spiced
winter
beer
dry
and
woody
with
a
hint
of
spices
drinkability
is
going
to
depend
on
you
liking
a
dry
beer
drinkability
not
your
typical
winter
warmer
this
one
has
a
nice
dry
oak
like
finish
to
it
that
is
missing
out
of
alot
of
other
seasonal
beers
the
nice
earthy
aromas
are
pleasant
and
for
6
8
abv
this
one
goes
down
like
a
charm
a
good
toasted
malt
backbone
is
nicely
aligned
a
good
start
for
the
winter
and
a
nice
brew
to
kick
back
with
on
those
colder
nights
drinkability
one
of
shipyards
better
beers
i
get
a
huge
dose
of
finished

i
could
have
two
of
these
srinkability
this
one
makes
me
wish
i
had
bought
more
then
a
single
but
i
have
been
burned
too
many
times
mouthfeeldrinkability
frothy
and

the

painfully
average
and
unremarkable

soso
a

somewhat
simple
englishminded
brew
for
winter
or
whenever
really
bottle
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
good
froathy
tan

the
head
lasts
well
has
a
malty
aroma
with
hints
of

good

and
a

the
flavors
really
come
together
well

this
is

it
still

serving

dark
amber

a

that
leaves
fine
thin
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
caramel
malt
brown

and
dark
fruit
tastes
much
like
the
smell
with
some
very
subtle
holiday
spicing
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
a
milder
spiced
winter
warmer
that
suits
me
just
fine
d
doesnt
seem
like
a
6
80
abv
goes
down
pretty
easy
i
would
have
another
im
no
fan
of
special
ales
but
ive
had
many
that
are
better
than
this
a
pleasant
suprise
to
a
forethought
mediocrity
dark

small

that
dissipates
quickly
lively
carbonation
apparant
aroma
is
filled
with
dark
malt
scents
molasses
caramel
dark
brown
sugar
taste
is
a
bit
tame
a
nice
dark
malt
but
not
very
complex
perhaps
a
hint
of
clove
could
use
some
more
winter
spice
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
could
use
a
little
more
body
and
creamyness
a
solid
very
passable
beer
but
not
a
remarkable
winter
warmer
a
style
that
rewards
inventiveness
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
mediumbrown
color
with
a
soft
offwhite
head
and
significant
carbonation
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
toast
alcohol
and
roasted
malt
interesting
but
not
unusual
or
overly
enticing
the
taste
followed
suit
with
an
initial
hopmalt
balance
that
quickly
shifted
towards
malt
and
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
the
texture
was
rather
slick
and
thin
but
refreshing
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
some
pizza
and
it
was
a
good
match
this
beer
reminded
me
of
both
a
belgian
dark
ale
and
a
bitter
i
will
certainly
enjoy
the
remainder
of
the
sixpack
i
picked
up
good
drinkable
beer
d
gets
easier
to
drink
as
it
goes
would
be
a
favorite
in
colder
weather
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
that
reminds
one
that
sometimes
the
wait
is
worth
it
d
very
drinkable
ale
that
i
enjoyed
in
an
english
style
pub
i
think
the
surroundings
made
this
beer
all
the
better
and
i
would
certainly
try
it
again
i
would
especially
like
to
try
it
on
tap
or
from
a
bottle
to
see
how
the
beer
differs
great
job
shipyard
ok
so
i
once
got
way
too
drunk
with
this
beer
and
a
very
hot
girl
i
wont
lie
i
should
have
had
more
of
her
and
less
of
it
but
i
figured
it
was
worth
a
revisit
because
i
did
have
a
good
time
with
her
and
it
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
dark
chestnut
color
with
a
finger
of
thin
khaki
head
the
retention
was
not
very
good
but
the
lacing
off
the
little
collar
was
pretty
good
as
thin
rings
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
toasted
malt
a
touch
of
sourness
and
some
light
spice
the
flavors
were
pretty
good
at
first
toasted
and
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
lightly
spicy
notes
that
appeared
in
the
middle
after
this
it
became
just
a
little
awkward
not
bad
just
awkward
with
that
touch
of
sourness
and
some
bitter
hops
before
it
became
more
nutty
the
finish
was
distinctly
of
roasted
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
just
a
little
watery
but
otherwise
solid
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
very
good
though
a
little
strange
i
really
thought
this
was
a
great
example
of
the
flavor
profile
one
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
dark
pour
defined
by
warming
alcohol
and
levels
of
complexity
i
bet
this
would
age
pretty
well
maybe
mellow
out
a
little
for
now
it
packs
a
punch
so
take
it
slow
one
of
my
new
favorites
for
a
winter
seasonal
my
favorite
shipyard
thus
far
a
nice
winter
full
caramelmalty
flavor
with
lots
of
toastiness
on
the
way
down
moderate
maple
sugar
sweetness
as
well
some
hop
tang
on
the
end
of
the
drink
no
spiced
or
holiday
flavor
really
which
is
great
some
holiday
beers
are
overdone
the
prelude
is
an
exception
just
a
really
good
ale
not
too
carbonated
and
buttery
mouthfeel
this
just
became
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
christmastime
ales
can
be
iffy
things
too
much
not
enough
no
relation
c
this
years
harpoon
sadly
is
subpar
while
shipyards
is
a
damn
fine
drinking
ale
while
not
overtly
spiced
or
sweetened
to
death
it
retains
a
just
enough
particularly
in
the
nose
to
remind
you
of
ol
st
nick
crew
a
nice
dark
redbrown
pour
sits
with
a
orangeybeige
2
finger
head
that
laces
away
like
water
as
you
drink
the
aroma
has
a
nice
spiced
leather
malt
with
orange
spice
hints
the
flavor
is
milder
a
smooth
clean
feel
in
the
mouth
that
starts
with
a
mild
hop
bitter
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
leading
to
a
nicely
malted
taste
with
nods
towards
cashew
yeast
extraordinarily
easy
to
drink
do
we
need
to
wait
for
the
christmas
season
each
year
where
can
i
find
it
on
draught
drinkability
nice
winter
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
and
dry
finish
makes
it
easy
to
have
a
second
pint
way
easy
drinker
had
to
pace
myself
to
let
the
cold
pour
warm
up
enough
to
give
if
a
fair
analysis
recommended
drinkability
not
to
strong
certainly
more
drinkable
than
some
of
the
fuller
bodied
winter
ales
around
9
or
10
bucks
a
sixpack
shipyard
prelude
pours
a
dark
almond
brown
with
a
hint
of
amber
nice
initial
tight
compact
head
that
later
fades
to
a
ring
smell
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
malts
and
yeast
taste
is
nutty
and
bitter
the
nut
flavor
from
this
ale
is
really
pleasant
but
the
bitter
aftertaste
takes
it
away
which
i
dont
care
for
mouthfeel
is
thin
yet
really
smooth
with
a
fluffy
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
drink
i
didnt
like
the
bitterness
of
the
aftertaste
but
everything
else
was
right
on
for
an
ale
d
could
definitely
knock
back
my
share
of
these
the
hops
up
front
was
more
than
i
suspected
definitely
softens
the
spice
and
sweetness
for
a
winter
warmer
the
beer
is
surprisingly
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
modest
carbonation
the
6
8
abv
is
very
well
hidden
the
beer
is
clean
crisp
with
bittering
hops
that
make
the
beer
slightly
imbalanced
by
the
time
the
finish
rolls
around
there
is
a
slight
caramel
flavor
slightly
roasted
malts
maybe
even
some
charred
flavors
that
get
accentuated
with
the
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
the
beer
was
not
terribly
complex
nor
overly
full
of
character
but
the
butterscotch
flavors
typical
of
shipyard
were
definitely
present
and
complemented
the
somewhat
sharp
bittering
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
the
hop
bitterness
lasted
into
the
aftertaste
a
good
winter
warmer
but
not
a
brilliant
or
complex
one
i
would
recommend
this
one
over
their
regular
offerings
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
style
im
a
big
fan
of
i
had
a
tall
one
and
could
have
easily
had
another
some
winter
warmers
taste
either
like
pie
spice
or
burnt
bread
this
is
neither
nice
tasty
elements
that
are
very
well
balanced
with
the
caramel
sweetness
and
buttery
elements
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
a
nice
comfortable
sipper
that
also
went
very
well
with
a
big
smoky
bacon
cheeseburger
i
will
seek
this
one
out
for
a
six
pack
very
very
decent
and
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
was
sitting
at
the
bar
and
of
all
the
brews
on
tap
this
one
was
a
constant
order
and
understandably
so
i
liked
this
beer
alot
i
was
very
suprised
how
good
it
was
it
is
a
deep
red
to
light
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
brown
head
decent
amount
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
sweet
raisins
and
stone
fruit
butterscotch
floral
hop
nose
the
taste
is
caramel
butterscotch
and
toasted
grain
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
i
have
had
highly
recommend
pours
a
very
nice
dark
browncopper
color
with
some
good
inital
head
and
almost
decent
lacing
very
nice
strong
malty
scent
extremely
deep
with
a
nice
head
of
spice
brown
sugar
too
maybe
good
flavor
very
deep
and
earthy
a
nice
thick
malty
taste
with
a
good
undertone
of
spiciness
including
some
cinnamon
perhaps
a
little
caramel
and
a
nice
bit
of
brown
sugar
its
a
bit
thick
going
down
but
nothing
bad
or
really
good
about
the
mouthfeel
though
being
from
maine
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
shipyard
the
prelude
is
different
though
latley
ive
become
real
into
the
winter
warmer
style
perhaps
it
being
the
snow
starting
to
fall
the
appearance
is
real
dark
redamber
with
copper
accents
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
scoth
ale
with
strong
sweet
accents
of
malt
almost
reminiscent
of
the
roasted
smell
one
finds
in
porters
and
stouts
the
taste
is
strong
with
darker
malts
lots
of
breads
and
butters
on
the
tongue
no
real
presence
of
hops
but
none
is
needed
in
this
style
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
smooth
and
the
alcohol
really
begins
to
warm
about
half
way
through
great
beer
probably
the
best
from
shipyard
that
i
know
of
drinkability
is
fairly
high
its
a
solid
beer
and
pretty
tasty
its
mild
mannered
for
the
most
part
but
with
some
interesting
flavor
profiles
not
overly
complex
but
enough
to
sit
and
enjoy
by
a
fire
d
above
average
winter
ale
the
alcohol
doesnt
really
warm
the
belly
like
others
but
it
certainly
is
an
enjoyable
and
sessionable
seasonal
beer
this
brew
isnt
overly
complex
and
certainly
wont
wow
you
i
dont
personally
like
the
highly
spiced
winter
warmers
so
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
just
a
decent
easy
drinking
winter
beer
it
truly
is
a
winter
warmer
great
flavor
character
and
very
enjoyable
on
a
cold
night
ive
had
a
handful
of
shipyard
beers
in
the
past
and
lets
just
say
there
were
far
less
than
spectacular
their
pumpkin
ale
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
and
their
others
were
pretty
boring
but
this
one
is
above
average
and
proved
my
view
of
this
brewery
to
be
off
its
nothing
fancy
here
a
nice
biscuity
bready
winter
warmer
that
goes
down
super
smooth
and
looks
great
it
has
a
high
abv
so
it
really
warms
you
up
and
is
super
drinkable
no
frills
and
delicious
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
warmer
not
spicy
like
most
but
sweet
and
malty
fairly
dark
clear
amber
pour
cream
head
malty
aroma
sweet
and
roast
some
spice
surprisingly
solid
medium
body
malty
carameltoffee
with
nice
spice
and
christmas
sugar
cookie
accents
not
as
much
hop
presence
as
some
christmas
ales
which
i
found
nice
clean
finishing
and
very
drinkable
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
d
this
one
has
some
age
on
it
but
it
is
still
a
real
nice
beer
i
found
it
at
the
back
of
the
beer
fridge
and
decided
to
consume
it
i
am
glad
i
did
it
was
a
great
way
to
finish
off
a
hard
nights
work
chalk
up
another
average
beer
for
shipyard
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
minimal
head
malty
with
some
sugar
spicy
flavor
in
there
and
slightly
sour
in
the
finish
its
decent
and
warming
but
nothing
too
great
it
was
however
5
for
a
six
pack
so
the
price
was
very
good
d
incredibly
wellbalanced
smooth
brew
for
carrying
an
abv
of
almost
7
ill
be
interested
to
see
if
the
taste
matures
more
when
i
crack
the
case
open
again
later
in
the
year
bottle
poured
a
clear
medium
copper
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
some
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aromas
of
huge
caramel
malt
are
totally
dominating
with
a
nice
light
hoppy
touch
taste
is
also
dominated
by
that
huge
mediumsweet
caramel
malt
with
a
light
hoppy
finish
full
body
with
great
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
detectable
i
really
like
the
balance
between
the
medium
sweet
caramel
malt
light
hoppy
notes
really
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
purchased
this
22oz
bomber
from
the
brewery
last
weekend
and
served
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
huge
brown
head
that
leaves
lacing
that
lasts
till
the
end
smells
like
butterscotch
and
caramel
and
a
light
hop
aroma
tastes
like
butterscotch
and
then
some
hops
come
in
with
no
spice
until
the
end
i
can
also
detect
some
toffee
in
the
taste
and
a
nice
light
bitterness
at
the
end
their
is
a
decent
carbonation
to
the
beer
with
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
like
the
predominant
ringwood
character
and
find
the
body
to
be
very
drinkable
but
the
lack
of
malt
flavor
here
is
holding
this
one
back
the
aroma
and
flavor
have
the
creamy
candy
and
spice
from
the
yeast
and
then
the
flavor
has
a
slight
roasted
element
to
it
theres
a
small
earthy
finishing
hop
bite
and
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
easy
enough
to
drink
that
reading
the
abv
here
is
surprising
still
a
nice
ww
overall
especially
if
you
dig
ringwood
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
very
nice
the
aroma
isnt
overwhelming
but
theres
a
nice
bit
of
malt
its
a
mighty
tasty
beverage
with
a
great
balance
of
hop
spice
and
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
bit
heavy
for
more
than
a
couple
but
over
all
a
wonderful
beer
drinkability
a
very
poor
mans
anchor
osa
falvor
isnt
as
bold
as
it
cold
be
plus
hops
could
be
a
little
more
stronger
as
well
seems
watery
because
of
somewhat
dullish
flavor
but
its
not
finish
is
warm
with
some
citrus
zing
had
this
one
in
the
beer
cellar
for
a
while
pours
copper
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
good
retentionand
very
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
dark
fruitsand
spices
body
is
mediumand
carbonated
taste
is
of
sweet
fruitswith
a
mix
of
hopsthat
give
it
a
hint
of
grapefruit
spicey
finish
excellent
drinkability
this
is
drinkable
and
makes
for
a
good
winter
warmer
feels
thick
and
chewy
has
a
liqueur
burn
on
the
way
down
syrupy
strong
sweet
loaded
with
alcohol
really
a
fine
beer
d
poor
i
really
dont
like
this
one
at
all
its
way
off
base
m
and
d
a
lot
of
carbonation
makes
this
a
palate
tickler
the
pleasantly
dry
and
spicy
finish
makes
this
an
easy
drinker
too
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
dark
amber
brown
with
pillowy
offwhite
head
of
about
a
half
of
an
inch
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
as
it
susided
aroma
was
that
of
sweet
malt
bread
and
some
alcohol
tastes
very
sweet
and
a
little
biscuity
with
some
hops
in
the
finish
mouhfeel
is
medium
drinkibility
is
okay
but
may
be
to
sweet
to
drink
very
many
very
good
beer
overall
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
see
it
around
its
a
unique
experience
and
deserves
a
chance
on
your
taste
buds
another
hurrah
for
new
england
beer
a
vast
complex
medal
meriting
winter
warmer
without
overthetop
abv
mint
and
clove
and
peppercorn
and
mellowed
with
a
year
of
ageing
medium
mouthfeel
and
smooth
for
its
style
a
little
roasting
and
hops
here
decent
smooth
though
sparkling
medium
mouthfeel
pours
a
reddish
ruby
color
with
a
small
brownish
head
the
smell
isnt
very
strong
and
is
one
of
this
beers
only
downfalls
what
little
smell
is
pretty
much
some
sweet
malty
hints
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
very
malty
little
or
not
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
and
so
is
the
beer
its
a
decent
beer
i
was
completely
surprised
by
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
runoftheroad
beer
but
this
was
exceptional
d
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
shipyard
to
date
this
is
a
complexy
and
very
good
beer
this
should
be
a
yearround
brew
worth
a
try
delicious
warmer
one
i
wish
i
had
more
of
i
wont
miss
winter
but
i
sure
will
miss
the
slew
of
delicious
warmers
i
tried
this
winter
prelude
will
make
it
into
the
rotation
as
soon
as
i
get
more
of
it
my
first
time
with
prelude
found
at
local
hannaford
market
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
color
little
bit
of
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
of
malt
and
some
kind
of
christmas
popurri
tastes
quite
sweet
with
spices
buttery
a
bit
of
citrus
and
back
to
the
popurri
again
kind
of
odd
average
mouthfeel
fizzy
overall
not
that
impressed
the
flavors
dont
do
it
for
me
its
not
horrible
but
not
something
that
i
can
really
enjoy
shipyard
can
do
better
bought
this
as
a
winter
sampler
pack
from
cost
plus
world
market
so
its
the
only
one
ive
got
i
will
seek
it
out
again
though
the
prelude
is
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
far
better
than
most
of
its
new
england
peers
another
winter
season
score
for
shipyard
this
is
the
first
winter
warmer
style
beer
ive
had
so
theres
not
much
i
can
compare
it
to
overall
it
was
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
though
it
never
really
grabbed
me
drinkability
is
so
so
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
all
that
interesting
either
ill
definitely
drink
it
with
no
problem
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
notes
i
cant
get
past
the
metallic
twinge
pass
i
liked
a
few
others
this
season
above
prelude
but
i
had
heard
good
things
about
years
past
so
i
will
try
it
again
next
year
or
see
how
it
is
with
a
little
age
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
creme
head
that
falls
quickly
to
leave
a
thin
film
on
the
top
of
me
brew
nie
sweet
and
woody
kind
of
nose
flavor
is
tangy
at
first
smooths
out
nicely
as
time
goes
on
nice
mellow
sweet
tones
with
a
malty
edge
that
is
noticed
but
not
the
dominant
feature
here
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thicker
and
slick
on
the
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
nice
but
low
overall
i
found
this
a
really
easy
to
drink
winter
warmer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
nice
example
of
the
style
i
highly
suggest
this
one
i
kind
of
forgot
about
reviewing
it
for
a
while
as
i
just
enjoyed
sip
after
sip
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
too
high
drinkability
is
a
little
low
just
because
this
is
a
pretty
hardy
beer
but
it
seems
to
a
slight
change
of
pace
from
most
winter
warmers
i
could
see
sitting
on
a
few
of
these
to
until
next
winter
to
see
if
the
taste
has
balanced
out
a
little
poured
into
stone
ris
glass
beautiful
opaque
chesnut
amber
hue
with
1
finger
of
almond
head
slight
toffee
aroma
very
bass
ale
smelling
taste
of
dried
cherries
and
bass
ale
hate
to
keep
typing
that
but
that
is
all
i
am
getting
sweet
molassas
malt
flavor
good
carbonation
with
a
touch
of
hops
not
bad
drinkability
this
could
be
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
ever
had
its
probably
my
least
favorite
style
i
wish
the
taste
could
keep
up
with
the
intrigue
that
the
aroma
created
i
expected
something
to
be
truly
smooth
and
buttery
the
whole
way
hops
and
alcohol
put
that
notion
to
bed
overall
a
decent
beer
dont
drink
and
review
black
with
a
strong
creamy
halfinch
offwhite
head
coffee
and
malt
hops
balanced
well
medium
presence
with
some
roasted
caramel
medium
creamy
body
that
settles
on
the
back
of
the
tonguesmooth
hops
aboundbitter
but
soft
in
its
strength
as
a
christmas
celebratory
not
badalcohol
is
slightly
present
and
warms
as
the
glass
expires
a
pretty
smooth
beer
a
bit
buttery
in
the
mouth
carbonation
seems
off
a
little
too
much
but
doesnt
interrupt
the
flavor
if
anything
helps
the
spice
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
considering
this
is
a
more
subtle
winter
warmer
that
doesnt
hit
you
with
too
much
spice
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
immediately
thought
that
this
one
wasnt
for
everyone
in
fact
i
didnt
care
for
my
first
few
sips
however
as
it
warms
and
you
get
used
to
the
character
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
there
is
a
pleasant
earthy
quality
about
it
the
spices
are
harsh
at
first
but
then
as
you
drink
they
fade
into
the
background
i
want
to
compare
it
to
an
english
style
beer
but
it
is
too
aggressive
for
that
certainly
worth
a
try
the
complexity
of
this
one
will
grow
on
you
pours
a
beautiful
rubyred
chestnut
color
with
an
impressive
frothy
head
that
lingered
for
a
bit
shipyards
fall
offering
of
pumpkinhead
ale
was
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
all
season
so
i
had
high
hopes
for
their
winter
warmer
and
wasnt
in
the
least
dissapointed
one
of
the
best
winter
brews
ive
tried
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
caramel
cinnamon
and
sweets
the
taste
strongly
complements
the
aroma
bursting
with
an
uncanny
flavor
that
borders
on
magnificent
really
glad
i
decided
to
try
this
beer
nice
warming
alcohol
glow
accompanies
a
sweet
caramel
taste
that
sticks
to
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
great
and
the
brew
goes
down
real
smooth
for
a
winter
warmer
another
awesome
selection
from
a
great
brewery
definitely
recommended
overall
a
tasty
and
clean
winter
warmer
impressive
abv
does
the
trick
without
presenting
any
alcohol
warmth
the
drinkability
is
great
for
a
winter
warmer
very
high
in
alcohol
but
doesnt
taste
it
like
some
do
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
nice
off
white
creamy
head
medium
size
bubbles
with
very
little
lacing
head
subsided
shortly
after
2nd
quaff
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
fruit
like
sweet
can
smell
the
alcohol
but
not
over
bearing
first
taste
is
slight
bittering
roasty
caramel
then
finishing
faint
melon
and
pineapple
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
carbonation
very
drinkable
beer
as
we
have
found
it
to
be
a
good
session
beer
this
was
a
pretty
average
offering
in
most
aspects
i
really
didnt
get
much
at
all
as
far
as
the
nose
and
as
far
as
taste
the
only
thing
i
could
detect
was
roasted
malts
the
alchohol
was
present
but
not
overly
done
this
one
could
use
a
touch
of
personality
the
taste
was
mostly
of
mildly
bitter
hops
and
very
little
roasted
malts
not
a
really
impressive
ale
but
nice
enough
for
company
when
they
come
over
for
christmas
cheer
pours
a
rubyreddish
color
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
mostly
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
with
spices
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
upfront
like
a
pale
ale
and
theres
not
much
spice
or
anything
else
showing
through
kind
of
rough
around
the
edges
as
well
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
it
softens
somewhat
however
i
just
dont
think
i
could
drink
another
bottle
of
this
beer
ive
had
better
winter
warmers
overall
this
beer
does
what
a
winter
warmer
should
do
in
my
opinion
anyway
give
you
an
overall
warm
toasty
feeling
make
you
feel
festive
and
taste
like
a
christmas
cookie
in
a
bottle
overall
a
tasty
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
i
would
imagine
that
repeated
drinking
would
leave
me
with
a
full
belly
d
a
fair
winter
warmer
but
there
are
better
choices
out
there
for
me
so
this
isnt
something
ill
probably
go
back
to
i
like
the
victorian
era
new
england
scene
on
the
bottle
though
d
very
drinkable
able
to
drink
nice
and
smoothly
decent

like
this
one
a

poured

roasty
notes
in
the
bouquet
dark
rolly
large
malty
with
a
slightly
hop
bitter
finish
in
the
pull
rather
nice
beer
fluffy
is
a
good
word
for
it
not
my
favorite
winter
beer
in
august
but
close
overall
a
good
one
for
sitting
around
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
enjoyed
mine
in
the
middle
of
the
florida
summer
and
it
was
refreshing
and
pleasant
definitely
worth
a
try
new
england
winter
classic
like
a
stronger
more
concentrated
version
of
old
thumper
tastes
like
bananas
foster
with
the
banana
caramel
and
alcohol
aromas
and
flavors
the
hops
in
this
brew
tame
the
diacetyl
flavors
to
a
better
balance
than
in
any
of
shipyards
other
brews
a
wintertime
caramel
cordial
drinkability
is
high
for
the

tasted

da
easy
to
drink
good
for
the
style
taste
was
a
great
example
of
a
quality
winter
beer
big
malty
character
spices
corriander
and
cloves
slight
hop
bitterness
though
never
to
the
point
of
distraction
and
a
sweet
somewhat
warming
alcoholic
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
crisp
this
really
is
a
great
winter
beer
and
you
can
tell
it
was
brewed
in
a
place
where
they
know
about
cold
winters
check
it
out
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
nice
kick
not
as
filling
as
most
beers
in
the
style
i
would
pick
this
beer
over
most
others
in
the
style
particularly
if
im
not
going
for
the
heavy
sweetness
that
most
beers
in
this
style
typically
have
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
from
this
beer
but
it
was
a
little
bit
different
and
it
was
pretty
decent
poured
a
light
translucent
brown
with
a
minimal
head
which
quickly
faed
leaving
behind
a
decent
lace
smell
was
candy
sweet
lots
of
grain
and
malty
grass
hints
with
an
overlay
of
candy
apple
nice
well
rounded
smell
the
taste
was
suprisingly
hoppy
and
well
formed
very
nice
malt
presence
lots
of
spices
and
a
touch
of
bread
but
the
hoppy
ness
grabbed
you
in
the
beginning
and
left
a
nice
linger
big
sweet
caramel
and
candied
flavors
as
well
nice
and
smooth
good
quality
session
overall
i
dont
know
if
i
would
consider
this
really
a
winter
beer
but
it
was
very
nice
actually
quite
pleased
by
it
and
would
definaly
have
another
quality
ale
always
a
nice
winter
treat
and
worth
the
trip
from
ny
to
a
ne
state
to
get
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
dark
golden
amber
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
head
hung
around
for
a
while
and
clung
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
during
the
entire
pint
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
tasted
sweet
maybe
butterscotch
or
caramel
but
not
sickly
sweet
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
backend
of
it
a
little
to
bubbly
in
the
mouth
to
completely
enjoy
but
otherwise
a
great
winter
beer
put
a
warmth
in
my
cheeks
thanks
to
ba
mtanji
for
sharing
pours
a
nice
dark
red
with
great
clarity
smalloff
white
head
that
retains
well
smells
like
delicious
butterscotch
and
malt
at
first
but
then
comes
at
you
with
a
whole
bunch
of
awesome
fruit
esters
wow
apples
pears
prunes
even
very
unique
very
complex
you
could
get
lost
here
before
even
tasting
it
tastes
almost
like
it
smells
too
great
sweet
malt
flavor
thats
well
balanced
with
some
fruity
hop
flavors
i
want
to
say
i
detected
a
slight
trace
of
white
grapes
in
this
flavor
as
well
it
also
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
warming
effect
thats
quite
nice
in
this
bitter
cold
this
is
one
of
the
few
winter
warmers
ive
had
and
if
there
are
others
that
are
anything
like
this
i
will
have
to
make
it
a
point
to
seek
them
out
this
is
just
delicious
pours
a
perfectly
clear
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
big
tan
head
aroma
is
a
little
fruity
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
becomes
softer
and
more
rounded
as
it
warms
its
slightly
sweet
at
first
but
then
turns
bitter
with
a
little
alcoholic
finish
the
alcohol
provides
a
nice
warming
effect
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
drinkability
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
beyond
a
couple
of
these
overall
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
winter
night
beer
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
well
sustained
off
white
head
nose
is
of
somewhat
nutty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
spices
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
hint
of
nuts
and
bittering
hops
it
is
like
an
amber
ale
with
extra
malts
and
extra
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
smooth
on
the
palate
which
leads
to
easy
sippin
drinkabilty
is
very
good
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
hint
of
alcohol
which
fits
the
style
to
a
tee
this
is
another
nice
effort
by
this
brewery
it
pours
a
copper
brown
color
w
a
nice
fluffy
head
i
waited
a
moment
for
the
head
to
tone
down
and
took
a
deep
breath
ahh
spicy
with
buttery
caramel
lets
taste
better
than
it
smells
and
very
spicy
i
like
it
you
can
taste
the
sweetness
but
the
spice
is
really
good
not
like
your
typical
winter
or
even
pumpkin
ale
where
the
spice
takes
over
though
the
sweetness
is
involved
in
the
aftertaste
drink
laces
the
glass
significantly
very
nice
i
wish
it
wasnt
a
seasonal
i
had
never
tried
a
shipyard
product
this
is
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
had
in
sometime
definitely
pick
some
up
if
you
can
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
blue
fin
stout
that
also
came
this
month
22oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
reddish
brown
color
there
is
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
that
drops
off
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
nice
with
mainly
floral
and
spicy
notes
a
hint
of
the
malts
come
through
also
the
taste
is
quite
good
also
a
bit
of
nuttiness
up
front
with
some
of
the
spices
in
the
background
a
bit
of
a
dry
bitterness
to
the
finish
a
very
good
winter
beer
to
give
a
try
big
beer
tho
effectivenesswise
second
in
a
row
shipyard
winter
beer
of
the
night
translucent
dark
copper
body
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
diacetyl
dominates
the
aroma
with
just
hints
of
hops
alcohol
and
malt
roasty
or
toasty
flavor
not
quite
as
roasty
as
a
porter
but
not
that
far
off
diacetyl
is
also
a
big
player
in
the
flavor
but
does
not
overwealm
the
roastiness
but
rather
enhances
hints
of
alcohol
are
also
present
on
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
a
very
solid
very
tasty
brew
id
definitely
get
this
one
again
this
is
one
of
the
milder
winter
warmers
ive
tried
they
seem
to
be
rather
spicy
or
just
hint
at
it
i
did
enjoy
it
i
could
see
it
pairing
well
with
some
crisp
spiced
foods
or
a
very
strong
cheese
give
it
a
shot
before
the
thaw
i
will
be
looking
for
another
helping
before
then
prelude
ends
up
being
a
reasonable
offering
from
the
maine
brewery
and
yes
the
bitterness
does
go
away
as
the
beer
warms
goes
well
will
white
meets
and
their
gravys
id
imagine
it
compliments
stuffing
nicely
as
well
only
downside
is
that
i
get
a
bit
of
mixed
bag
within
the
6
pack
some
of
the
bottles
were
on
the
blander
side
and
others
were
quite
sharp
and
biting
ive
purchased
this
beer
several
times
now
and
this
variance
continues
dont
let
that
discourage
you
as
it
is
a
very
good
beer
in
the
correct
situation
beer
is
a
bit
unbalanced
but
quite
tasty
too
many
bittering
hops
and
not
enough
floral
i
would
have
prefered
more
hop
nose
to
balance
the
aftertaste
or
less
bittering
hops
to
balance
the
sweet
nose
bit
too
thin
for
my
tastes
but
i
do
love
winter
beers
and
cherish
any
experience
i
can
have
with
one
ive
never
encountered
its
a
cold
weather
beer
it
fits
the
style
well
mildly
chewy
and
a
wee
bit
overbubbley
mouthfeel
its
mediumheavy
in
body
easy
to
drink
yet
quite
potent
a
great
winter
brew
d
good
to
retry
it
reminds
me
of
a
recipe
i
make
every
couple
of
years
goes
down
easy
pours
a
nice
orange
almost
red
with
a
thick
almost
tan
head
i
got
a
mouthfull
of
foam
on
my
first
sip
and
its
a
good
hoppy
taste
hoppy
to
the
taste
not
completely
overpowering
which
is
good
the
malt
helps
to
balance
this
out
this
is
pretty
good
i
like
this
better
than
a
couple
other
offerings
ive
sampled
by
this
brewer
i
like
it
definitely
worth
a
try
probably
should
be
getting
harder
to
find
by
now
but
my
local
shop
still
had
a
good
amount
the
beer
has
a
medium
full
body
and
a
finish
that
has
a
lingering
lightlyastringent
bitterness
the
diacetyl
is
definitely
noticeable
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
at
least
it
is
subdued
enough
that
it
is
not
obnoxious
to
this
diacetyl
sensitive
person
the
diacetyl
actually
accentuates
the
fruitiness
in
this
beer
i
get
notes
of
fig
some
datelike
notes
and
a
soft
berry
note
towards
the
end
this
beer
is
quite
malty
lots
of
toffee
a
caramel
note
and
some
dry
toasted
notes
this
is
definitely
a
nice
winter
warmer
it
is
rich
and
satisfying
with
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
yes
even
the
subtle
diacetyl
adds
to
the
complexity
of
this
brew
though
i
could
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
character
here
though
hold
the
diacetyl
in
check
please
this
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
large
foamy
head
this
is
really
a
good
looking
beer
except
that
the
head
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
faint
to
me
i
could
only
sniff
out
a
slight
malt
scentnothing
great
the
taste
is
a
very
good
mix
of
sweet
maltnesshopsand
holiday
spices
the
mf
is
medium
and
the
flavors
mix
very
well
all
in
allthis
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
holiday
beers
ive
tried
this
is
one
beer
that
ill
look
forward
too
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
consists
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
hint
of
candied
fruits
the
taste
starts
out
with
the
same
caramel
malt
flavor
that
is
present
in
the
aroma
along
with
subtle
candied
fruit
flavors
pretty
decent
beer
good
for
warming
up
your
gut
on
those
cold
nights
a
smooth
drinking
and
flavorful
winter
ale
where
the
hell
is
the
7
5
abv
the
best
shipyard
brew
i
can
remember
having
i
also
didnt
know
it
was
7
5
abv
until
a
local
pub
told
me
i
had
to
have
a
smaller
serving
because
of
the
alcohol
content
toud
never
tell
by
its
taste
notes
i
am
something
glad
i
picked
up
this
one
wow
what
a
brew
lace
lines
the
glass
from
start
to
finish
simply
one
of
the
best
winter
brews
out
there
shipyard
produced
a
well
crafted
beer
cheers
loose
how
much
wood
could
a
woodchuck
chuck
head
to
start
with
some
prevalent
stick
and
lace
metal
copper
hue
that
is
nicely
clear
with
very
little
action
just
some
light
floaters
fungal
fling
of
chewy
choke
on
nose
some
cool
smokiness
and
a
fairly
good
hop
presence
to
mouth
as
usual
buttery
aspects
along
with
some
sharp
fangs
of
creamsicle
chocolate
flavor
eh
good
enough
but
would
move
on
to
something
else
with
no
reservations
pretty
good
perhaps
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
shipyard
does
a
good
trick
on
a
cold
winters
night
the
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
not
too
heavy
and
very
fitting
matching
the
bitter
qualities
and
not
loaded
down
with
maltiness
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
if
i
found
it
again
dark
tea
color
a
thin
beige
head

up
slightly
and
disappears
quickly
aroma
is
rich

a
little
sweet
some
fruit
cinnamon
and
cotton
candy
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
a
little
tingly
perhaps
a
tad
overcarbonated
flavor
is
initially
pungent
with
alcohol
overpowering
other
flavors
a
little
stringent
but
malt
and
plum
emerge
as
do
sharp
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
gets
richer
as
it
warms
but
a
little
sweet
sort
of
syrupy
and
chewy
spruce
tips
emerge
as
do
clove
and
frankensense
rounding
out
the
holiday
flavors
its
mouthfeel
was
fullfilling
yet
left
me
yearning
for
more
bravo
shipyard
im
taking
a
vacation
in
maine
next
year
just
to
visit
you
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhitetan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
warm
and
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
chocolate
malts
and
roasted
barley
the
hops
help
balance
the
aroma
the
taste
is
excellent
it
has
a
creamy
malt
flavor
that
boasts
of
chocolate
and
crystal
malts
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
smooth
and
slightly
warm
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
it
is
quite
complex
and
full
of
flavor
a
kick
ass
seasonal
casked
its
bit
thinner
than
i
remember
from
the
bottles
enjoyable
nonetheless
with
a
pleasant
roasty
maltiness
and
an
earthy
natural
tone
to
the
overall
feel
not
my
most
favorite
winter
brew
but
its
a
treat
to
have
a
casked
pint
served
from
a
22oz
bomber
acquired
shortly
before
christmas
pours
into
the
glass
a
very
dark
amber
topped
with
short
lived
off
white
foam
aroma
is
mostly
malty
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
rotting
fruit
taste
is
very
malty
and
caramelized
with
just
a
bit
of
spice
and
hints
of
raisin
and
cherry
finally
some
hop
bite
comes
in
to
save
the
day
towards
the
end
and
finishes
with
a
nice
bitterness
moderate
carbonation
quite
full
body
maybe
a
prelude
but
not
the
main
course
for
me
pours
with
a
twofingered
offwhite

that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
good
lace
light
medium
carbonation

for
a
22oz
bottle
pretty
drinkable
holiday
brew
but
nothing
spectacular
solid
opened
the
bomber
while
dressing
for
a
christmas
party
poured
a
nice
brownamber
with
a
decent
rocky
head
the
head
stayed
fro
the
whole
time
with
attractive
lacing
during
consumption
the
nose
was
nothing
to
speak
of
mild
nutty
and
spice
notes
with
a
hint
of
sweet
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
alelike
nothing
too
high
abv
or
overly
spiced
the
beer
finished
well
after
swallowing
with
a
nice
dry
hop
aroma
mouthfeel
and
good
spicey
and
nutty
flavors
that
lingered
after
each
mouthful
overall
this
was
a
decent
holiday
ale
that
neither
dissapointed
nor
exhilerated
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
tastes
sweet
from
the
malt
but
not
too
sweet
a
touch
of
buttery
and
chewey
help
out
the
sweetness
hops
are
sharp
and
to
the
point
of
balance
the
strength
is
almost
fully
hidden
the
best
shipyard
beer
ive
had
so
far
very
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
taste
one
of
these
and
for
the
honor
i
thank
mr
rabidawg
the
taste
is
somewhat
unremarkable
a
little
bit
of
caramel
malt
with
some
of
that
everrepetitive
shipyard
diacetyl
not
a
unique
brew
by
any
stretch
the
malts
give
way
to
a
weak
hop
finish
im
just
a
little
bit
disappointed
that
this
tastes
like
a
lot
of
other
shipyard
beers
nice
mahogany
color
head
that
dissipated
quickly
definite
winter
warmer
malty
aroma
with
a
definite
hop
accent
initial
malt
sweetness
ended
in
a
beautiful
hop
presence
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
light
for
the
high
abv
drinkable
but
dont
guzzle
havent
had
it
in
bottle
since
last
year
so
i
will
have
to
grab
some
in
bottle
form
to
another
great
beer
by
shipyard
presented
in
a
22oz
bomber
poured
a
deep
glowing
ruby
color
with
a
medium
off
white
head
with
medium
retention
aroma
is
of
sweet
sticky
candy
not
very
strong
but
i
assume
it
will
grow
while
it
warms
despite
the
sweet
smell
the
flavor
was
surprisingly
not
oversweet
at
all
very
nicely
balanced
with
barley
malts
on
the
forefront
finishing
with
a
piney
hop
bite
and
a
little
extra
spiciness
throughout
mouthfeel
has
moderate
carbonation
and
is
mediumheavy
in
body
excellent
ale
for
the
winter
very
warming
and
definetely
very
drinkable

this
topnotch
brew

yummy
winter
warmer
as
a
prelude
into
spring
a
dark
amber
brew
with
a
very
bubbly
head
and
lots
of
red
highlights
make
for
a
delicious
look
the
aroma
is
a
bit
mellow
some
caramel
malt
and
a
little
roast
and
spicy
hops
in
the
backround
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
roastynutty
finish
it
has
a
nice
malt
sweetness
with
some
spicy
hop
flavor
that
builds
as
it
comes
to
room
temp
at
the
half
way
point
it
has
a
nice
mellow
bitter
finish
to
balance
the
sweetness
an
easy
drinking
big
beer
that
fits
the
local
weather
scene
this
ale
poured
a
slightly
hazy
dark
copperred
color
with
good
slightly
offwhite
foam
that
did
not
leave
much
lace
the
smell
was
modest
but
good
sweet
caramel
malt
aroma
the
taste
was
sweet
some
caramel
malt
overtones
on
top
of
a
candy
sugar
taste
there
were
also
hints
of
oak
and
floral
hops
and
the
sweetness
lingered
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
relatively
clean
other
than
the
sweetness
the
body
was
medium
this
was
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
ale
served
warmer
this
brew
seems
to
come
alive
a
bolder
malt
profile
and
the
spicy
hoppiness
lead
into
the
warming
alcohol
feel
very
nicely
i
found
this
very
drinkable
in
the
12oz
bottles
but
i
would
love
to
try
a
bomber
or
from
draft
even
sometime

the
smell
is
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
the
taste
is
similar
in
terms
of
balance
but
a
bit
more
complex
the
hops
take
over
a
bit
in
the
end
for
a
nice
bite
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
youngs
old
nick
barley
wine
style
ale

better
this
beer
would
do

aroma
some
unidentifiable
funkiness
the
flavor
incorporates
the
caramel
and
toasty
malt
flavors
with
this
unusual
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
sweetwater
festive
ale
i
had
attributed
the
flavor
to
mace
which
is
one
of
the
spices
in
festive
ale
but
im
not
so
sure
this
one
is
spiced
maybe
its
the
butterscotch
flavor
of
the
infamous
ringwood
yeast
but
i
didnt
know
sweetwater
used
that
yeast
for
festive
ale
so
im
confused
theres
a
bit
of
slighty
citric
hops
underneath
all
this
that
breaks
up
the
maltfunk
party
a
bit
a
deep
mahogany
body
with
soft
ruby
highlights
is
capped
by
a
firm
light
tan
head
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
when
served
only
lightly
chilled
it
will
maintain
a
solid
head
as
it
warms
the
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
caramel
light
chocolate
malt
some
mild
spice
and
butterscotchlike
diacetyl
that
actually
adds
greatly
to
the
character
reminiscent
of
a
rich
holiday
cake
very
nice
the
body
is
full
with
a
very
fine
and
restrained
carbonation
that
leaves
it
exceptionally
creamy
and
smooth
almost
syrupy
as
the
carbonation
breakout
foams
up
under
the
warmth
of
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
rich
with
some
limited
ripe
fruit
upfront
coattailed
by
a
biscuity
maltiness
thats
slathered
at
first
in
caramel
and
later
in
soft
milk
chocolate
a
mild
spiciness
as
it
crosses
that
palate
and
then
a
firm
butterscotch
some
minerallike
leafy
hoppiness
and
an
underlying
bitterness
in
the
finish
long
lingering
and
almost
as
rich
as
the
flavor
itself
the
aftertaste
is
massively
impressive
with
swirling
notes
of
caramel
butterscotch
drying
bitterness
and
leafy
hoppiness
do
yourself
a
favor
and
enjoy
this
at
cellar
temperature
as
a
dessert
beer
fantastic
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
as
a
special
treat
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
good
book
in
front
of
the
hearth
i
did
go
home
warm
smoky
sweet
malt
aroma
inviting
and
reminiscent
of
the
winter
season
all
the
flavors
hit
at
once
then
divide
and
conquer
the
taste
buds
initial
sharp
sweetness
with
bitter
spiciness
could
use
a
bit
of
mellowing
to
meld
the
flavors
more
the
malt
is
huge
all
the
way
through
with
a
light
buttery
finish
after
hampshire
ale
my
favorite
seasonal
i
only
drink
it
in
the
22oz
bottle
i
think
the
six
pack
loses
some
of
the
taste
nice
deep
amber
color
sweet
taste
the
perfect
fire
side
beer
each
sip
puts
me
in
the
christmas
mood
as
i
almost
feel
the
snowdrops
melting
on
my
face
maybe
its
the
abv
but
this
is
just
a
great
winter
beer
very
drinkable
but
watch
out
for
the
high
abv
this
is
a
great
beer
notes
lots
of
great
winter
ales
to
come
from
the
ne
this
one
surely
sits
somewhere
on
the
best
of
the
best
list
this
beer
really
showcases
the
ringwood
yeast
characteristics
butterscotch
aromaalong
with
hints
of
molassas
and
buttery
malty
flavor
have
been
mentioned
more
than
once
and
blend
beautifully
with
the
bitter
finsh
great
beer
i
think
a
few
months
aging
will
do
it
some
justice
yummy
overall
started
out
with
good
potential
even
after
the
first
sip
but
really
faltered
from
there
still
a
solid
brew
but
not
dhs
best
so
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
one
reminds
me
of
the
southern
tier
warlock
overall
this
is
an
aggressively
spicy
flavorful
brew
that
could
only
be
appropriate
for
the
season
im
not
especially
keen
on
allspice
to
begin
with
and
in
this
case
its
far
from
balanced
i
had
this
on
tap
a
couple
months
ago
and
recall
a
much
mellower
brew
so
im
not
sure
which
experience
is
more
representative
of
the
brewers
intention
nice
warm
winter
ale
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
day
after
shoveling
some
snow
o
a
very
unique
take
on
a
winter
warmer
which
has
me
scratching
my
head
on
whether
i
truly
like
it
or
not
in
the
end
i
dig
it
for
the
plain
fact
that
its
so
smooth
for
how
strong
it
is
also
theres
a
complexity
to
it
that
you
dont
find
in
most
winter
warmers
truly
its
own
unique
beer
this
is
an
excellent
warmer
nailing
all
those
classic
spices
and
bringing
more
to
the
palate
than
just
a
sugar
rush
and
a
mess
on
tap
at
side
door
madison
whoa
thats
some
serious
flavor
too
sweet
for
me
though
overall
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
and
worth
getting
taste
heavy
on
the
palate
with
that
potent
dose
of
winter
spice
i
also
get
a
little
chocolate
undertone
happening
and
a
bittersweet
finish
that
definitely
packs
some
heat
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
winter
warmer
over
all
im
glad
i
tired
this
beer
while
it
was
around
would
love
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
if
i
can
find
a
bottle
a
great
winter
warmer
ale
spices
are
not
overwhelming
and
the
beers
flavor
is
complimented
by
the
added
spices
id
drink
it
twice
this
beer
had
way
too
much
spice
beer
looks
and
tastes
fantastic
up
front
its
like
a
nice
trappist
quad
but
it
finishes
a
little
hoppy
definitely
recommended
3
35
far
from
perfect
but
its
definitely
not
boring
either
too
much
clove
or
allspice
for
me
great
dark
brown
color
though
tasted
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
on
december
23
2014
very
particular
about
winter
warmers
the
idea
of
a
gingerbread
flavored
beer
sounds
great
and
it
smelled
wonderful
but
it
was
a
little
overpowering
on
the
taste
i
feel
like
the
strong
sugary
flavor
needs
to
be
a
tad
more
subtle
like
in
lagunitas
brown
shugga
still
a
pretty
good
and
festive
beer
though
ounique
change
of
pace
recommend
as
an
after
dinner
desert
beer
i
am
going
to
cellar
the
other
3
bottles
until
next
year
too
much
clove
for
me
the
only
thing
questionable
to
me
was
the
aroma
will
have
to
test
more
from
different
glasses
and
places
taste
is
very
holiday
scotch
ale
mild
stout
an
interesting
and
aromatic
winter
brew
that
tastes
more
like
a
bland
imperial
stout
than
a
winter
warmer
its
not
bad
just
slightly
uninteresting
in
the
flavor
otherwise
itd
be
a
great
stout
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
a
revisit
o
it
is
pretty
much
what
it
claimed
to
be
a
big
holiday
spice
beer
cheers
great
for
the
holidays
by
a
warm
fireplace
i
originally
gave
this
a
lower
rating
but
i
just
had
it
on
tap
at
one
of
my
favorite
bars
and
its
even
better
a
great
winter
beer
from
dark
horse
overall
a
delicious
warmer
darker
style
with
lots
of
spiciness
pours
burnt
caramel
and
very
cloudy
the
low
head
is
a
light
tan
and
dissapated
quickly
once
in
the
chilled
imperial
pint
glass
its
medium
body
is
almost
opeque
you
can
only
see
light
through
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
spices
really
come
out
in
the
aroma
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
mix
in
with
molasses
making
me
think
of
sitting
in
front
of
a
fireplace
with
a
cigar
in
my
favorite
holiday
sweater
during
a
week
long
blizzard
the
spices
stand
out
from
the
first
gulp
nutmeg
is
almost
overpowering
but
the
other
spices
come
through
and
combine
richly
with
the
molasses
in
the
end
the
beer
does
have
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
or
alcoholic
taste
but
overall
it
balances
nicely
and
isnt
a
real
hard
drink
overall
i
would
recommend
buying
it
in
singles
but
a
definite
must
try
better
than
most
winter
ales
very
nice
aroma
and
color
well
balanced
can
definitely
tastesmell
of
cloves
would
recommend
for
winter
ales
pleasant
and
warming
winter
warmer
o
anyone
who
relishes
the
supper
spicy
holiday
beers
will
enjoy
this
offering
for
me
it
is
just
a
jumble
of
spices
a
subtle
hand
would
server
this
beer
better

o
im
sure
its
a
well
crafted
brew
but
the
spice
blend
here
was
just
not
enjoyable
for
me
it
was
like
my
mouth
was
trapped
in
a
candle
shop
overall
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
i
have
had
might
be
too
sweet
to
have
multiple
at
a
time
but
overall
a
great
holiday
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
ales
and
really
sets
itself
apart
from
many
others
a
very
unique
beer
that
is
wonderful
likely
very
true
to
the
style
but
not
my
taste
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
and
spice
overpowering
the
base
beer
drinking
it
kind
of
late
in
the
year
poured
with
huge
chunks
wont
be
finishing
it
because
of
that
christmas
nutmeg
spiced
aroma
not
bad
smelling
taste
fine
to
dark
cocoa
taste
with
lots
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
flavors
the
chunks
is
the
only
off
putting
thing
well
worthwhile
o
a
very
spicy
winter
ale
with
well
hidden
abv
update
a
half
hour
later
i
let
the
last
3
ounces
warm
up
a
bit
the
sweet
and
spice
mixes
better
than
when
cold
and
the
crisp
edge
is
way
mellowed
the
mouthfeel
didnt
flatten
out
all
that
much
in
my
opinion
to
do
this
beer
justice
it
has
to
be
served
a
bit
warmer
than
the
typical
beer
its
a
different
story
i
updated
my
taste
and
overall
ratings
they
were
set
to
3
25
cold
but
im
making
them
3
75
based
on
the
taste
when
it
is
a
bit
warmer
poured
into
a
goblet
almost
completely
opaque
very
dark
reddish
brown
poured
with
a
1
finger
bubbly
head
that
was
gone
by
the
time
i
carried
it
to
table
small
amount
of
lacing
remained
aroma
was
flightly
fruity
sweet
kind
of
a
smokey
spiced
grape
juice
nicely
flavored
a
bit
sweet
but
not
overly
so
a
bit
of
banany
clove
flavor
felt
good
in
the
mouth
nicely
coated
a
bit
of
stick
not
much
carbonation
overall
a
good
example
of
a
winter
warmer
without
being
too
heavily
spiced
o
a
very
unique
beer
and
a
different
take
on
the
winter
warmer
overall
an
odd
spiced
somewhat
fruity
and
very
malty
and
bitter
version
of
a
winter
warmer
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
except
that
the
spices
and
dull
bitterness
throughout
are
a
definite
drawback
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
i
was
thinking
and
looking
for
a
little
less
dry
and
a
little
sweeter
malt
from
this
beer
to
really
boost
my
overall
enjoyment
if
you
like
black
ipas
you
might
enjoy
this
beer
the
first
bar
i
had
this
at
had
it
listed
in
the
5
range
i
was
pretty
sure
it
was
a
weee
bit
stronger
but
at
almost
9
i
had
no
idea
o
12
dogs
of
christmas
is
my
only
comparison
for
the
style
but
this
was
slightly
better
this
is
more
balanced
overall
overall
this
an
enjoyable
holiday
offering
everything
works
well
together
here
in
a
very
drinkable

oits
a
nice
one
for
these
breezy
nights
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
but
not
my
least
favorite
worth
a
try
ooverall
a
great
winter
warmer
i
would
be
interested
what
the
bourbon
would
taste
the
body
is
medium
and
the
hard
bite
of
the
crispness
is
consistent
a
little
dryness
kicks
in
and
it
feels
like
it
wants
to
get
smoother
as
it
goes
but
that
kick
keeps
it
hard
o
drinking
this
on
christmas
eve
and
it
literally
warms
your
soul
exactly
what
a
christmas
warmer
should
do
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
winter
warmer
good
spice
presence
with
the
sweet
dark
malt
overall
some
porterstout
notes
with
this
spiced
winter
warmer
it
actually
reminds
me
of
a
ramped
up
anchor
christmas
ale
which
is
mostly
a
good
thing
but
this
beer
is
not
quite
as
harmonious
still
this
is
a
good
choice
for
the
holidays
the
taste
is
classic
spiced
winter
warmer
and
a
bit
boozy
the
aftertaste
is
just
spice
i
am
just
not
in
the
frame
of
mind
for
this
style
and
i
am
tired
of
it
lots
of
clove
rum
brown
sugar
chocolate
cinnamon
and
sweet
roll
hearty
and
spicy
and
semidry
perfect
warming
quality
in
the
stomach
not
in
the
mouth
only
a
thin
booziness
is
noticeable
on
the
tongue
some
dried
fruits
and
faint
orange
peel
maybe
a
kiss
of
star
anise
really
great
spice
composition
with
a
boost
of
malt
base
feels
nice
and
bold
with
an
enveloped
bite
a
great
experience
drinking
this
for
the
first
time
overall
an
ok
winter
warmer
but
far
from
great
the
flavors
are
just
too
muddled
and
the
sweetness
needs
to
be
dialed
back
a
bit
not
one
i
will
be
seeking
out
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
its
a
little
too
astringent
overall
not
bad
im
glad
most
breweries
are
keeping
the
spices
in
check
this
year
and
not
going
overboard
the
slimy
yeast
sludge
is
the
only
real
issue
i
have
with
it
also
maybe
a
little
too
syrupy
overall
despite
the
boozy
taste
the
feel
is
not
overly
warm
or
abrasive
it
poured
relatively
thick
but
was
more
moderate
in
its
fullness
overall
its
pretty
much
what
i
expect
in
a
winter
warmer
huge
dose
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
balanced
with
a
base
beer
which
i
assume
is
an
imperial
brown
worth
a
try
but
i
will
stick
to
plead
the
5th
for
a
true
warmer
overall
this
beer
is
okay
it
smells
great
looks
the
way
it
should
and
is
drinkable
o
bold
but
onedimensional
would
be
very
nice
if
both
the
spice
and
alcohol
were
turned
down
a
notch
overall
not
a
fan
and
could
not
finish
it
way
too
strong
on
the
nutmeg
i
absolutely
love
the
balance
of
4
elf
as
its
spices
are
restrained
enough
so
that
no
one
type
stands
out
also
the
ratio
of
sweet
to
spice
is
spot
on
as
i
go
back
and
forth
with
each
sip
about
which
pulls
ahead
this
dark
horse
offering
will
likely
be
a
standout
of
this
holiday
season
so
whats
up
with
dark
horse
and
random
numbers
during
this
time
of
year
o
this
beer
is
a
little
too
high
in
abv
to
be
one
that
you
would
drink
several
during
a
session
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
winter
warmer
maybe
a
touch
too
spice
heavy
for
my
preference
but
very
well
constructed
i
like
this
beer
it
definitly
has
the
christmas
spirit
o
ive
been
on
a
quest
of
sorts
for
some
years
now
to
find
the
perfect
winter
warmer
which
im
still
convinced
is
a
real
thing
that
exists
somewhere
ive
been
consistently
surprised
with
dark
horse
brews
and
this
is
no
exception
but
the
one
winter
warmer
to
rule
them
all
it
is
not
great
holiday
beer
thanks
a
nice
festive
winter
brew
but
the
clove
is
so
overwhelming
overall
a
really
nice
beer
loads
of
flavor
heavy
on
spices
but
has
some
fruit
flavor
to
balance
it
out
some
drinks
rather
smooth
for
being
8
75
a
great
winter
warmer
id
drink
again
and
this
isnt

preferred

overall
the
type

that
is
so
different
its
actually
a
joy
to
experience
this
was
my
first
time
having
4
elf
its
a
solid
holiday
brew
its
unique
and
different
from
alot
of
spiced
holiday
beers
it
has
some
stoutporter
qualities
to
it
its
good
stuff
but
it
didnt
get
me
overly
excited
its
worth
checking
out
though
its
definitely
fitting
for
the
holidays
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
1
finger
dark

head
lots
of
roasted
caramel
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
nutmeg
clove
slight
cinnamon
vanillia
and
hint
of
gingerbread
smells
of
christmas
toasted
gingerbread
and
roasted
caramel
come
through
first
in
the
taste
followed
mid
palate
by
vanillia
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
also
getting
some
strong
root
beer
tastes
toward
the
end
slightly
over
carbonated
abv
is
hidden
very
well
and
feel
is
slightly
thicker
than
medium
bodied
decent
price
decent
flavor
decent
brew
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
keeps
it
pretty
drinakable
overall
liked
it
but
not
amazing
i
really
enjoyed
the
clove
taste
as
well
as
the
allspice
i
am
not
sure
my
pallet
is
refined
enough
to
pick
out
the
nutmeg
especially
since
i
really
have
never
had
nutmeg
as
a
taste
that
was
distinct
like
nutmeg
during
the
holidays
nutmeg
i
have
been
drinking
mystic
chai
spiced
hot
tea
and
i
can
taste
some
similarities
which
is
cool
because
this
is
a
brew
i
did
feel
a
warmth
in
my
stomach
while
picking
up
leaves
which
may
be
because
it
was
cold
or
because
that
is
the
way
the
beer
is
designed
either
way
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
unlike
a
lot
of
winter
warmers
the
spices
werent
overdone
and
and
it
didnt
taste
as
strong
as
i
thought
it
would
for
being
8
75
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
and
the
taste
held
my
attention
i
think
two
of
these
would
be
just
the
right
amount
for
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
neither
the
malts
or
the
spices
were
too
overpowering
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
really
disliked
about
it
and
i
cant
think
of
anything
i
would
change
to
make
it
better
i
would
buy
this
again
and
i
would
like
to
keep
some
around
for
the
holidays
i
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
who
generally
likes
winter
warmers
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
im
glad
it
wasnt
over
spiced
thanks
for
distributing
this
beer
dark
horse
i
see
what
its
popular
and
its
nice
to
be
able
to
get
this
beer
without
having
to
take
a
trip
to
the
4
elf
release
party
good
job
guys
keep
up
the
good
work
if
you
dont
like
cinnamon
then
avoid
this
one
because
it
dominates
the
palate
overall
i
would
say
that
i
will
definitely
be
adding
this
to
the
already
expansive
roster
of
dark
horse
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoy
way
too
spicy
for
my
palate
with
a
roast
malt
backbone
that
comes
off
as
being
somewhat
acrid
not
a
fan
o
i
tried
this
back
in
january
and
the
spices
held
up
quite
nicely
i
like
the
fact
that
the
roasted
malt
flavor
is
there
or
this
would
just
be
a
holiday
spice
beer
opretty
decent
never
had
a
winter
warmer
and
im
drinking
it
during
the
summer
so
the
experience
probably
isnt
the
best
it
could
be
the
spices
are
too
strange
and
i
could
not
drink
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
overall
a
decent
brew
o
overall
its
a
cinnamon
bomb
with
not
too
many
qualities
that
i
enjoy
and
i
really
like
winter
warmers
this
just
didnt
hit
the
right
notes
for
me
i
honestly
never
heard
of
this
one
but
i
quite
liked
it
dark
brown
pour
with
a
small
tan
head
that
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nice
spicy
aroma
cinnamon
nutmeg
brown
sugar
with
a
touch
of
icinglike
sweetness
in
the
taste
all
the
spices
that
were
there
in
the
aroma
plus
rich
caramel
maltiness
and
a
little
vanilla
icing
light
herbal
hops
and
roasty
bitterness
for
balance
medium

smooth
mouthfeel
quite
enjoyable

very

o
overall
a
basic
solid
beer
that
i
could
have
again
quite
sessionable
for
the
strenght
overall
i
like
this
beer
ive
had
past
incarnations
that
were
higher
in
abv
and
as
much
as
i
wish
this
one
was
closer
to
past
versions
im
happy
with
this
one
o
meh
dark
horse
beers
are
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
this
one
is
a
miss
lacks
most
of
the
things
i
look
for
in
a
winter
warmer
mainly
the
malty
sweetness
and
a
subdued
hop
profile
probably
wont
be
returning
to
this
one
a
classic
example
of
too
far
for
me
i
dont
put
this
much
spice
in
my
mulled
apple
cider
spicing
is
out
of
control
overwhelms
the
beer
gets
too
close
to
being
straightup
undrinkable
as
is
an
almostaverage
novelty
o
awesome
winter
warmer
great
variety
of
spices
and
balance
of
flavors
nice
roasted
malt
fits
in
nicely
without
making
it
a
real
porter
or
stout
expertly
crafted
m
full
bodied
but
seems
nicely
carbonated
o
did
dh
f
this
beer
up
the
label
says
8
75
and
it
says
11
5
on
here
it
seems
like
they
changed
the
recipe
and
it
turned
out
terrible
and
they
said
f
it
well
sell
it
anyways
o
a
very
potent
flavorful
and
spicy
winter
warmer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
thanks
again

o
a
tasty
winter
warmer
thats
head
up
well
over
the
last
few
months
ive
only
had
one
other
beer
that
hid
11
this
well
without
using
excessive
amounts
of
residual
sugar
to
to
it
thats
the
other
elf
out
of
harrisburghershey
not
an
everyday
beer
but
a
nice
seasonal
sipper
im
glad
i
have
four
more
in
my
cellar
overall
this
is
another
nice
brew
from
dark
horse
they
might
go
down
in
my
books
as
the
kings
of
hiding
alcohol
at
first
i
would
have
guessed
this
was
a
6
beer
there
is
absolutely
no
heat
in
the
taste
and
i
dont
really
get
any
when
it
goes
down
either
as
always
theyve
managed
to
balance
this
quite
well
as
well
glad
i
snagged
a
bottle
of
this
o
this
wasnt
awful
compared
to
the
rest
in
its
style
i
actually
think
its
really
good
but
overall
not

especially
being
a
dark
horse
fan
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
roasty
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
recedes
quite
quickly
aromas
of
nutmeg
brown
sugar
cinnamon
and
some
orange
bit
disappointed
with
the
taste
as
it
did
not
mirror
the
delicious
aromatics
as
initially
indicated
flavors
of
dark
fruit
indistinct
spices
perhaps
some
nutmeg
somewhat
bittery
back
finish
as
mysterious
as
the
flavor
is
i
am
at
loss
of
how
well
hidden
the
high
alochol
is
mediumbodied
with
nice
carbonation
throughout
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
bit
the
more
i
found
myself
to
enjoy
this
one
i
would
gladly
have
this
one
again
on
a
cold
winter
night

overall
this
was

but
this
was
the
best
of
what
i
find
to
be
a
lame
style
really
well
played
dark
horse
tastes
like
christmas
still
subtle
though
4
elf
is
nothing
short
of
outstanding
the
most
flavorful
winter
warmer
ive
had
to
date
if
you
like
gingerbread
cookies
then
you
will
love
this
beer
it
truly
tastes
and
feels
like
a
snowy
winter
night
well
worth
seeking
out
o
very
nice
christmas
ale
from
dark
horse
one
of
the
best
ive
had
looking
forward
to
cracking
open
my
2009
vintage
later
this
evening
to
compare
overall
the
age
did
this
beer
well
still
warming
but
much
smoother
id
have
another
full
bodied
great
carb
super
sticky
lingers
like
a
nice
coffee
easily
my
favorite
winter
beer
ever
along
with
samichlaus
this
strong
winter
warmer
packs
in
tons
of
flavors
reminiscent
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
brown
sugar
and
allspice
every
winter
i
frequent
dark
horse
a
lot
to
get
my
hands
on
lots
of
this
like
i
said
best
winter
beer
ever
o
this
was
one
of
the
better
spicyherbal
winter
beers
ive
had
4
5
t
i
am
a
pretty
big
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
a
more
than
solid
example
of
it
good
all
around
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
was
hidden
remarkably
well
worth
a
shot
d
not
my
usual
cup
of
ale
good
to
try
12oz
bottle
shared
with
thirstybird
pours
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
base
head
eventually
dissipates
into
a
thin
band
and
a
soapy
skim
nose
expresses
allspice
licorice
and
sassafras
taste
reveals
chocolate
roast
spice
sassafras
licorice
and
slightly
bitter
earthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
even
crisp
carbonation
complex
and
interesting
with
an
amazingly
wellhidden
abv
i
can
hardly
believe
it
comes
in
at
11
5
d
as
a
fan
of
dark
horses
stouts
i
liked
this
one
very
much
one
that
i
would
pick
up
every
year
if
the
bottles
were
sold
in
my
area
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
very
spicy
but
well
done
and
not
too
over
the
top
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
prolly
better
with
age
d
this
is
astoundingly
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
the
flavors
are
mild
enough
to
keep
it
form
becoming
too
rich
this
has
aged
nicely
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
will
probably
age
very
well
dh
keep
it
up
the
beer
pours
out
very
dark
much
darker
than
i
expected
it
has
nightlights
if
chestnut
and
mahogany
not
much
of
a
head
the
spices
are
sweetand
aromatic
up
close
it
smells
like
a
malty
rich
strong
ale
lots
of
ginger
bread
nutmeg
cherries
and
light
cinnamon
spices
are
pretty
big
but
quite
unique
equally
as
big
is
a
deep
maltiness
gingerbread
dried
cherries
toffee
cocoa
raisin
it
starts
strong
but
the
finish
is
lackluster
carbonation
is
pretty
high
and
the
body
leaves
me
wanting
more
heft
this
its
almost
like
a
fruitcake
in
a
glass
one
of
the
more
interesting
winter
warmers
d
very
good
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
spiced
brews
but
i
really
liked
this
one
went
well
with
my
meal
and
would
be
a
great
christmas
brew
pours
brown
and
clean
not
much
going
on
in
the
pour
a
good
amount
of
smooth
white
head
with
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
spices
christmas
in
a
bottle
but
different
from
your
average
christmas
ale
much
more
spiced
and
herbal
tastes
strongly
of
herbs
and
nutmeg
some
other
spices
come
through
fairly
strongly
decent
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
d
a
nice
spiced
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
smell
but
the
high
abv
definitely
comes
through
a
bit
in
the
taste
would
have
again
the
spices
are
all
i
taste
maybe
some
caramel
malts
definitely
no
hops
this
probably
hits
the
winter
warmer
style
its
just
not
my
style
long
linger
of
spices
on
the
tongue
not
recommended
for
me
to
try
ever
again
but
probably
those
who
like
spiced
beers
will
like
it
overall
a
beer
im
glad
i
tried
but
i
would
choose
other
holiday
spiced
ales
for
my
liking
as
this
beer
warms
the
flavors
do
open
up
and
get
rounder
less
cinnamon
and
more
dark
roasted
malts
the
body
is
very
nice
very
creamy
and
soothing
definitely
a
cold
weather
beer
a
nice
winter
warmer
but
too
much
cinnamon
and
heat
for
my
taste
d
very
tasty
what
i
drank
really
filled
me
up
so
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
but
would
drink
again
thanks
again
to
dan
for
bringing
this
one
on
saturday
i
have
been
a
dark
horse
fan
for
a
while
now
but
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
one
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
very
reminiscent
of
christmas
with
a
big
clove
aromas
which
leads
to
a
bunch
of
other
holiday
spices
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
tons
of
clove
a
little
vanilla
and
caramel
very
tasty
winter
warmer
picked
up
last
december
in
detroit
pours
dark
brown
without
a
noticeable
head
yet
some
carbonation
still
there
conifers
and
cinammon
dominate
the
smell
ginger
predominates
the
taste
a
bit
of
nutmeg
spicy
sweetness
though
not
too
sweet
tasty
average
mouthfeel
dthis
is
very
tasty
dark
horse
is
infamous
for
making
huge
abv
beers
extremely
drinkable
and
this
falls
right
into
that
category
where
do
they
put
11
5
alcohol
in
this
4
elf
looks
very
dark
with
a
big
12
inch
or
more
of
a
off
white
head
with
tannish
glint
to
it
some
minor
stickage
to
the
glass
smells
sweet
and
spicy
with
holiday
spices
malt
background
some
cinnamon
and
candycanes
taste
consist
of
dark
fruit
with
some
cherry
as
well
backed
by
spices
including
nutmeg
alot
of
sweetness
with
the
candycanes
and
caramel
no
toffee
some
minimal
chocolate
feel
is
medium
and
coating
spicy
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
a
hint
of
alcohol
i
would
love
to
get
ahold
of
more
of
this
in
the
wintertime
so
i
could
enjoy
it
more
for
sure
something
to
warm
up
to
i
had
no
doubt
that
this
would
be
big
considering
the
brewer
but
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
not
cloying
well
made
d
nicely
drinkable
for
the
style
and
im
not
usually
a
fan
i
like
this
one
though
and
in
fucking
july
i
bet
id
like
it
more
in
the
right
season
ill
say
this
there
is
no
sign
of
the
abv
ill
be
sure
to
keep
my
eye
out
for
more
in
the
fall
pours
dark
with
a
tan
head
when
held
up
to
light
seems
a
really
dark
reddish
color
smells
like
delicious
ginger
snaps
cinnamon
and
some
clove
i
tasted
ginger
cinnamon
allspice
and
some
cloves
with
an
alcohol
finish
delicious
it
has
a
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
very
good
sipper
drinks
amazingly
the
spice
covers
the
bite
very
well
here
pours
a
deep
cloudy
brown
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
with
a
quantity
of
cinnamon
and
maybe
cloves
the
taste
us
way
spicier
than
the
aroma
would
make
me
think
extremely
thick
i
think
that
it
might
be
better
if
i
were
to
drink
it
in
a
colder
clime
it
just
tastes
overly
thick
and
boozy
for
me
md
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
not
bad
this
is
exceptionally
drinkable
and
will
be
looking
for
this
next
winter
d
this
was
a
interesting
beer
that
i
seemed
to
really
really
love
i
need
to
make
sure
that
pick
some
more
of
this
up
next
time
im
at
the
brewery
dark
horse
does
no
wrong
yet
once
again
a
good
winter
warmer
but
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
having
said
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
of
these
for
latter
this
is
an
excellent
spiced
beer
very
big
for
the
style
almost
reminds
me
of
a
pumpkin
porter
extremely
tasty
a
very
solid
winter
warmer
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
others
at
the
tasting
didnt
think
much
of
it
saying
it
was
overspiced
but
i
thought
it
was
great
d
drinkable
as
hell
i
reallly
liked
this
beer
wish
i
had
one
to
have
on
christmas
morning
overall
this
is
a
massive
beer
for
the
style
i
cant
believe
the
abv
on
this
beer
i
am
really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
it
was
a
good
experience
i
think
this
is
a
one
and
done
however
d
the
spice
and
alcohol
get
to
you
after
a
bit
but
are
still
delicious
adding
a
bit
more
body
and
perhaps
a
little
more
sweetness
would
really
turn
this
into
a
delightful
brew
still
quite
good
by
any
measure
overall
quite
a
different
brew
this
might
be
my
first
winter
warmer
and
i
can
tolerate
it
i
recommend
anyone
to
give
this
one
a
try
the
warmest
and
most
satisfying
winter
warmer
i
have
had
yet
great
beer
its
one
of
the
better
and
more
satisfying
winter
beers
ive
had
happy
holidaze
d
continuing
on
from
my
shock
i
cant
believe
this
beer
is
this
big
it
drinks
like
a
6
beer
and
is
something
i
could
have
a
few
of
in
the
night
which
would
cause
problems
this
is
a
great
beer
for
lovers
of
pumpkin
beers
i
think
a
lot
of
people
will
like
this
but
the
spices
just
dont
appease
my
palate
drinkability
considering
the
size
of
the
brew
and
the
intensity
of
the
spices
its
actually
really
tasty
the
chocolate
and
spices
are
intense
and
pretty
much
awesome
nice
change
of
pace
this
time
of
year
and
a
good
beer
thats
saying
something
too
considering
winter
warmers
arent
my
favorite
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
the
malt
body
here
is
well
placed
and
the
alcohol
is
never
too
much
in
the
flavor
this
ends
up
being
quite
warming
in
the
end
and
the
mix
of
spices
really
work
i
personally
enjoy
the
forward
clove
aspect
a
stellar
spiced
brew
from
dark
horse
paired
well
with
some
carr
valley
menage
cheese
and
fun
to
drink
in
the
summer
thanks
hoppymeal
to
start
off
this
was
a
very
interesting
brew
that
i
am
glad
i
sampled
brew
poured
a
black
translucent
color
w
a
one
finger
cream
head
had
the
look
of
a
black
tea
w
carbonation
laced
the
glass
nicely
and
it
pretty
much
stuck
around
for
the
remainder
of
the
tasting
the
nose
was
a
real
treat
w
the
aromas
of
chai
tea
vanilla
ginger
clove
and
nutmeg
the
taste
was
pretty
much
on
par
as
expected
w
a
finish
of
mild
bittering
hops
for
11
abv
this
brew
was
surprisingly
drinkable
due
to
the
herbsspices
masking
well
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
wanted
this
to
be
slightly
creamier
overall
this
brew
was
very
unique
interesting
and
enjoyable
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
sample
but
dont
think
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
due
to
it
reminding
me
more
of
tea
than
beer
this
brew
was
more
of
a
mind
expander
than
anything
for
me
drinkability
for
those
who
like
a
nice
spicy
winter
warmer
this
beer
is
the
real
mccoy
a
bit
too
high
in
alcohol
to
drink
more
than
one
ive
had
two
bottles
of
this
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
the
thought
of
cracking
one
and
venturing
into
the
unknown
seemed
a
daunting
task
for
such
an
unwilling
holiday
voyager
had
i
known
the
joy
this
beverage
would
bring
i
would
have
cracked
it
sooner
im
very
happy
to
have
one
more
bottle
of
this
thanks
alex
thanks
dark
horse
d
i
didnt
didnt
look
at
the
alcohol
content
until
i
started
typing
this
paragraph
the
11
5
is
hidden
pretty
well
by
all
of
the
spice
going
on
here
it
started
coming
out
a
little
as
it
began
to
warm
pretty
much
a
one
and
im
done
but
it
was
immensely
enjoyable
till
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
is
good
complex
seasonal
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
its
not
really
my
kind
of
thing
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
color
ale
with
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
spices
nutmeg
and
light
cinnamon
with
a
well
balanced
sweet
roasty
malt
body
taste
is
also
very
well
balance
between
some
sweet
malt
with
notes
of
nutmeg
and
light
cinnamon
and
maybe
some
white
pepper
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
creamy
body
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
done
with
great
balance
while
being
easily
drinkable
way
more
spicy
than
i
care
for
but
it
would
probably
pair
up
well
with
fresh
gingerbread
or
rumcake
a
very
solid
winter
warmer
nicely
spiced
and
really
shows
through
on
the
middle
and
finish
same
tastes
as
the
nose
would
suggest
slightly
too
much
spice
for
my
liking
however
which
skewed
the
score
somewhat
otherwise
one
of
my
favorite
spice
winter
warmers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
4
elf
is
an
excellent
holiday
beer
its
absolutely
loaded
with
holiday
spice
flavor
while
its
not
exactly
novel
in
that
sense
the
spicy
flavor
is
definitely
unique
cinnamon
comes
through
very
strong
but
it
works
soooo
well
i
have
only
one
slight
complaint
and
thats
that
the
nose
is
just
a
little
weak
it
wouldnt
take
much
to
work
out
that
kink
its
a
close
call
as
it
is
nevertheless
4
elf
is
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
d
this
is
how
a
winter
spiced
beer
should
taste
malty
with
good
spice
presence
but
not
overwhelming
perfect
to
sip
by
a
warm
fire
poured
a
deeper
brown
color
with
an
averaged
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
lots
of
spices
ginger
cinamon
and
a
bunch
of
others
chocolate
and
i
was
getting
some
berries
in
there
too
the
spices
were
definitely
the
strongest
of
the
aromas
tastes
of
the
same
spices
chocolate
and
caramel
this
one
was
all
about
the
spices
black
body
thin
cap
of
tan
foam
pleasing
aroma
of
gingerbread
cookies
vanilla
nutmeg
the
usual
holiday
cookie
medley
full
bodied
creamy
slightly
lactic
feel
more
stout
than
anything
which
dark
horse
excels
at
dry
spice
notes
similar
to
the
nose
dominant
gingerbread
and
vanillanutmeg
not
overly
sweet
its
well
balanced
and
unique
for
a
winter
warmer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
quick
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
tiny
bits
of
lacing
remain
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
but
not
a
whole
lot
there
is
definitely
some
sediment
floating
around
as
well
smell
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
gingerbread
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
chocolate
malts
egg
nog
and
a
good
amount
of
nuttiness
as
well
very
pleasant
aroma
nothing
overdone
or
in
your
face
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
bit
more
spice
nutmeg
ginger
and
some
pumpkin
up
front
midway
the
rich
malts
emerge
and
lead
to
the
spicy
aftertaste
once
again
the
flavors
are
in
check
with
nothing
over
the
top
crazy
medium
to
full
body
with
a
rich
feel
and
a
prickly
carbonation
there
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
by
far
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
out
there
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
hopefully
i
can
crack
open
another
one
of
these
come
christmas
2009
thanks
again
craig
good
mouthfeel
with
some
soft
carbonation
notes
thanks
to
craig
for
this
because
i
am
a
bitch
overall
this
is
what
every
winter
warmer
should
be
another
hit
from
darkhorse
absolutely
amazing
and
everything
id
want
from
a
winter
warmer
i
wish
i
couldve
picked
up
more
of
this
its
on
par
with
3
guys
if
you
ask
me
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
hope
they
keep
brewing
it
on
tap
at
dark
horse
served
in
a
pint
glass
its
a
very
deep
brown
color
with
a
small
brown
head
that
fades
away
nose
is
malty
cinnamon
vanilla
and
some
sprucey
winter
notes
kinda
like
a
christmas
wreath
candle
taste
is
heavy
malts
with
almond
and
chocolate
some
alcohol
on
warming
wintery
smooth
nice
holiday
beer
bottle
procured
somehow
by
kkulacki
he
got
engaged
across
the
state
the
day
this
was
released
so
i
have
no
idea
how
he
got
this
and
generously
sent
to
me
pours
surprisingly
dark
with
a
short
brown
head
laces
slowly
and
tightly
smells
magnificent
strong
nutmeg
and
allspice
with
wellbrewed
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
flavor
great
too
big
holiday
spiced
front
again
nutmeg
and
allspice
with
a
hint
of
hot
cinnamon
spices
very
strong
but
supported
well
by
a
chocolate
malt
body
and
well
balanced
but
warming
alcohol
full
bodied
a
bigger
than
life
but
extremely
enjoyable
winter
warmer
thanks
again
konrad
i
feel
like
a
sod
having
drank
this
in
july
it
really
would
be
a
great
sipping
beer
in
front
of
my
fireplace
on
a
dark
winter
night
im
not
completely
sure
about
the
style
of
this
beer
so
if
somebody
else
knows
better
than
correct
it
for
me
i
do
know
that
this
beer
was
spiced
up
bigtime
it
was
also
very
dark
and
very
thick
the
initial
taste
was
of
a
thick
burnt
malt
flavor
that
was
followed
by
some
spices
mainly
ginger
with
a
few
others
a
slight
floral
hop
flavor
came
but
went
very
quickly
because
more
spices
came
along
the
lines
of
nutmeg
and
cardamon
i
dont
know
what
exactly
all
the
spices
were
but
i
do
know
that
they
worked
well
in
this
beer
i
couldnt
have
too
many
of
these
though
because
they
were
very
filling
if
you
are
not
into
spiced
beers
stop
reading
now
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
if
however
you
enjoy
a
nicely
sweet
holiday
ale
with
a
high
enough
abv
to
warm
you
on
a
cold
night
this
is
a
good
one
i
poured
this
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
fizzy
beige
head
dissipated
quickly
leaving
a
trace
of
foam
atop
the
dark
reddish
brown
body
cinnamon
and
ginger
dominated
the
taste
leaving
a
very
pleasant
sweetness
behind
it
had
a
rich
semithick
mouthfeel
this
functions
nicely
as
a
dessert
beer
or
as
an
evening
sipper
im
planning
on
picking
up
a
couple
more
of
these
great
winter
beer
flavors

years

25
very
deep
red
color
without
any
transparency
smell
is
of
a
strong
cinnamon
with
a
sweetness
to
it
upfront
taste
is
cinnamon
with
an
aftertaste
of
slight
apple
mixed
in
the
smell
makes
it
seem
as
if
itd
be
overpowering
but
it
is
balanced
nicely
not
normally
my
type
of
beer
but
definitely
enjoyable
this
is
normally
not
my
kind
of
beer
i
dont
like
gingerbread
cookies
or
cinnamon
in
my
beer
but
this
was
just
the
right
amount
of
both
it
was
fantastic
and
i
would
gladly
order
it
again
had
on
tap
was
good
beer
but
spices
were
a
bit
much
for
me
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
thin
off
white
head
actually
very
holiday
aroma
is
sweet
cinnamon
nutmeg
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
spiced
christmas
fruit
cake
taste
same
as
aroma
with
some
mild
hops
bitterness
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
finishes
with
sweet
cinnamon
nutmeg
sweet
spices
of
fruit
cake
and
maybe
some
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
nutty
flavor
on
the
end
as
it
warms
up
overall
fairly
good
drink
i
am
not
a
fan
of
any
spiced
beer
no
matter
the
occasion
and
sadly
this
beer
falls
dead
square
in
that
category
the
immediate
aftertaste
is
a
mouthful
of
cinnamon
that
masks
everything
else
its
a
gimmicky
beer
and
thats
just
not
for
me
there
are
any
number
of
other
really
good
beers
on
tap
at
hoppin
frog
that
deserve
your
attention
this
is
not
one
of
them
i
am
usually
one
to
drink
very
seasonally
i
try
to
at
least
makes
me
feel
more
in
tune
with
my
surroundings
and
with
nature
and
generally
keeps
me
on
an
even
keel
drinking
a
strong
christmas
ale
in
late
june
is
not
something
that
usually
happens
but
a
friend
broke
out
this
bottle
with
a
little
age
on
it
and
wow
if
ever
there
is
a
holiday
ale
versatile
enough
to
work
in
hot
summer
weather
its
this
one
so
much
fresh
ginger
on
the
nose
and
late
palate
that
even
the
cinnamon
and
honey
spice
and
sweet
complex
on
it
doesnt
interfere
weigh
it
down
or
make
it
only
worth
drinking
when
the
snow
flies
i
found
it
almost
refreshing
and
through
its
clear
amber
body
i
was
amazed
how
much
and
how
vibrantly
the
ginger
came
through
first
class
all
the
way
with
just
enough
spicing
to
make
me
look
forward
to
the
holidays
without
making
me
overlook
the
present
carbonation
is
really
aggressive
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
time
has
done
this
well
no
doubt
its
so
smoothed
out
texture
wise
as
well
its
just
plush
and
round
and
surprisingly
not
real
sweet
almost
reminds
me
of
the
tropics
in
this
weather
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
shocked
how
much
i
really
got
off
on
this
given
the
season
as
good
as
any
beer
from
hoppin
frog
i
hope
to
be
able
to
procure
some
more
of
this
around
holiday
time
the
ginger
makes
it
like
not
other
beer
for
that
season
at
least
not
this
pleasantly
awesome

o
overall
i
was
seeking
this
out
a
few
years
ago
in
a
trade
but
glad
to
have
finally
tried
it
and
without
involving
any
shipping
i
would
drink
this
again
o
disappointing
beer
that
didnt
have
a
lot
going
on
kind
of
boring
o
i
found
this
beer
to
have
a
nice
amount
of
holiday
spices
that
didnt
seem
to
be
overdone
it
also
drank
rather
easily
for
a
winter
warmer
this
is
an
excellent
winter
warmer
the
beer
smells
and
especially
tastes
like
christmas
theres
a
great
amount
of
spice
heresome
cinnamon
peppermint
pepper
and
its
equally
spicy
and
sweet
its
darker
in
color
than
your
average
winter
warmer
and
it
does
finish
somewhat
sticky
but
the
high
abv
is
masked
pretty
well
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
sip
but
its
still
more
than
drinkable
during
the
winter
months
and
does
not
shy
away
from
flavor
while
also
not
going
overboard

the

i
think
this
beer
is
great
for
the
style
loads
of
flavor
not
in
a
bad
way
its
just
like
an
imperial
winter
warmer
which
is
cool
most
companies
put
out
these
super
mild
over
spicedunder
malted
winter
warmers
so
its
cool
to
have
a
company
go
all
out
with
one
however
with
all
that
being
said
this
one
bomber
is
more
than
enough
i
think
a
single
pint
of
this
sweet
gingerbread
molasses
strong
brew
around
the
holiday
season
would
hit
the
spot
perfectly
ill
definitely
be
grabbing
another
one
this
winter
not
heavy
bodied
but
true
brown
ale
medium
on
the
lighter
side
overall
i
feel
this
beer
is
great
even
two
months
old
quite
a
great
winter
warmer
indeed
even
more
so
at
6
bucks
a
bomber
i
have
to
thank
my
friend
rick
for
buying
this
beer
for
me
in
a
bar
near
akron
ohio
especially
since
we
didnt
know
it
was
15
00
for
a
tap
beer
the
few
hoppin
frog
bombers
i
find
in
colorado
also
cost
around
this
pricepoint
anyway
it
was
a
fine
tasting
xmas
ale
although
there
are
others
out
there
that
i
find
more
evenly
balanced
i
e
great
lakes
winter
ale
and
anchor
steam
christmas
ale
and
way
less
expensive
bottomline
its
a
fine
tasting
beer
but
not
necessarily
worth
the
money
pours
dark
reddish
orange
with
small
head
smells
like
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
smells
like
christmas
time
heavy
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
flavor
cinnamon
last
a
while
on
the
palate
smooth
base
beer
but
cant
taste
much
of
it
through
all
the
spice
slight
hint
of
booze
and
alcohol
warmth
definitely
a
nice
winter
ale
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
sweet
with
the
spice
rack
thrown
in
hits
what
it
is
going
for
but
really
just
fun
for
the
holidays
otherwise
not
my
thing
i
must
say
the
frog
on
the
front
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
overall
a
really
nice
beer
definitely
glad
i
bought
this
one
very
flavorful
and
a
great
christmas
sipper
i
plan
on
getting
this
one
next
winter
this
is
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
beer
quite
frankly
and
i
especially
enjoyed
cracking
this
one
and
many
others
open
with
my
friend
on
christmas
night
highly
recommended
o
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
beer
are
huge
i
loved
the
smell
but
the
cinnamon
flavor
was
almost
overwhelming
overall
i
havent
had
anything
less
than
exceptional
from
hoppin
frog
and
their
christmas
ale
is
no
exception
truly
delicious
o
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
as
it
does
improve
as
the
temperature
rises
overall
though
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
pumpkin
beer
wo
the
pumpkin
its
a
pleasant
beer
that
reminds
me
of
all
of
the
spiced
candles
weve
been
burning
o
as
a
general
rule
i
hate
winter
warmers
but
this
pretty
solid
definitely
worth
a
try
as
are
most
of
hoppin
frogs
beers
o
a
very
rich
sipping
beer
for
christmas
i
think
theyve
captured
the
holiday
spirit
well
in
this
potent
seasonal
brew
another
amazing
winter
warmer
from
ohio
here
wonderful
mouthfeel
is
heavymedium
bodied
carbonation
is
laid
back
doesnt
coat
the
mouth
slightly
dry
on
the
finish
o
i
like
this
beer
i
can
see
some
not
liking
it
as
its
spicy
but
the
flavors
are
ones
i
totally
dig
found
this
years
christmas
eve
beer
enjoy
o
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
especially
considering
the
price
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
not
bad
overall
honestly
this
beer
is
just
a
little
too
spiced
for
me
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
thin
dirty
white
head
head
disappeared
quickly
but
left
a
small
ring
that
clung
nicely
aroma
was
exactly
as
described
cinammon
with
some
ginger
smell
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
very
much
a
winter
smell
flavor
was
spicy
but
yet
still
pleasant
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
the
aforementioned
spices
were
nicely
balanced
the
cinnamon
was
up
front
with
a
bit
of
ginger
to
finish
the
sip
coated
nicely
in
the
mouth
went
down
as
it
should
overall
an
outstanding
beer
a
little
tweak
in
the
flavor
would
help
but
minor
issues
a
good
idea
that
went
overboard
on
the
spices
a
coca
cola
colored
brew
with
a
decent
light
tan
colored
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
clearly
a
christmas
scent
with
gingerbread
peppermint
and
evergreen
malt
real
likeable
the
flavor
delivers
more
of
the
same
with
lots
of
medicinal
malt
like
moxie
with
more
evergreen
and
cinnamon
spice
holiday
festivity
going
on
this
is
mediumplus
bodied
with
very
full
but
tiny
carbonation
to
provide
a
stout
but
luscious
feel
not
something
i
would
generally
drink
in
mass
quantities
but
a
great
holiday
brew
to
really
deliver
the
christmas
spirit
very
nice
o
for
a
winter
warmer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
in
the
right
setting
i
love
this
kind
of
beer
definitely
not
an
every
day
beer
but
for
a
cold
winter
night
this
is
an
excellent
companion
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
beer
where
the
spices
are
so
pronounced
i
can
very
easily
taste
all
three
spices
listed
on
the
bottle
which
include
cinnamon
ginger
and
nutmeg
and
that
hasnt
happened
before
for
me
the
spices
are
enough
so
i
dont
need
the
extra
malty
sweetness
yet
it
is
fitting
being
a
holiday
beer
i
would
by
this
again
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
might
turn
some
people
off
i
definitely
couldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
this
is
a
rare
holiday
indulgence
that
i
will
seek
out
again
next
year
first
mediocre
beer
from
hf
had
the
ba
version
which
was
well
balanced
with
the
barrelaging
cutting
down
the
spices
cant
recommend
this
version
though
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
that
slowly
recedes
smells
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
mostly
quite
heavy
spicy
aroma
obliterates
any
beer
smells
from
my
perception
taste
has
a
bit
of
a
caramel
sweet
malt
flavor
upfront
before
the
gingerbread
house
flavor
takes
over
and
ruins
this
beer
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
spice
laden
mouthfeel
i
wont
mince
words
here
this
beer
is
horrible
its
over
spiced
and
i
couldnt
finish
my
glass
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
nice
deep
garnet
color
with
well
defined
half
finger
off
white
head
atopgood
richness
and
definition
to
the
color
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
clove
mainlyi
could
tell
right
away
this
was
gonna
be
a
more
heavily
spiced
winter
warmer
heavy
cinnamoncloveand
nutmeg
on
the
palatenot
crazy
sweet
just
spiced
to
the
hiltsome
faint
toastiness
underneath
the
spice
does
come
thru
after
awhile
as
well
some
alcohol
sweetness
much
like
their
pumpkin
ale
the
winter
warmer
is
too
spiced
upi
do
like
this
better
than
the
pumpkin
beer
but
its
still
not
great
by
any
means
after
having
doris
which
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
i
was
excited
to
try
the
rest
of
their
lineup
and
selected
this
one
simply
awful
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
crystal
red
wine
glass
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
next
to
no
head
and
zero
retention
the
smell
is
probably
the
best
part
of
this
brew
very
clearly
defined
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
that
as
a
previous
reviewer
stated
hints
at
a
pumpkin
ale
the
taste
is
good
but
not
exceptional
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
come
through
but
are
overtaken
by
the
malt
flavored
and
finally
by
the
alcohol
very
little
carbonation
that
appears
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
barely
enough
to
keep
it
refreshing
by
my
account
tastes
to
me
almost
like
a
lager
because
of
the
malt
profile
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
a
good
one
to
try
but
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
from
ohio
great
lakes
christmas
ale
is
a
safer
bet
overall
this
was
a
nice
take
on
a
winter
warmer
style
beer
but
the
spices
could
have
been
toned
down
slightly
aroma
wise
they
were
quite
inviting
but
dominated
the
palate
and
the
flavor
profile
a
little
too
much
for
me
in
the
end
there
are
better
examples
for
lesser
points
so
i
would
recommend
looking
elsewhere
this
is
like
a
pumpkin
ale
without
the
pumpkin
wellspiced
christmas
ale
clocking
in
this
beers
100th
review
well
characterized
as
a
winter
warmer
this
is
a
highly
spiced
beer
evoking
christmas
pie
and
cookies
big

body
teetering
on
a
bit
syrupy
nutmeg
is
prominent
almost
overwhelming
with
a
hint

in
the
spice
shadow
nutmeg
is
heavyhanded
dominating
everything
including
a
the
caramel
and
sorghum
in
the
background
an
interesting
beer
but
quickly
tiresome
o
save
your
7
bucks
and
try
3
or
4
other
xmas
beers
for
the

price

pick
of

so
far
for
xmas
beers
overall
this
is
a
good
winter
beer
warms
you
up
as
you
drink
it
i
would
have
another
pours
a
murky
chestnut
red
with
a
crusty
looking
tan
head
and
large
bubbles
huge
spices
in
the
nose
tons
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
pumpkin
pie
like
some
sugary
malt
maybe
a
touch
of
berry
sweetness
and
a
metallic
twang
in
the
back
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
overly
spiced
and
messy
malts
with
an
off
twang
underneath
and
notes
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
full
bodied
syrupy
high
carbonation
last
year
i
had
this
beer
and
it
tasted
different
there
was
more
cinnamon
and
it
didnt
smell
like
apples
i
prefer
the
smell
of
this
years
beer
and
the
taste
of
last
years
beer
frosted
frog
nails
the
flavor
of
christmas
but
because
of
its
shere
sweetness
onedimensionality
and
low
complexity
im
happy
to
share
this
22oz
bottle
with
a
quatro
of
friends
to
save
for
palate
fatigue
its
good
but
i
think
it
might
bee
too
sweet
not
just
for
me
but
i
think
its
a
little
bit
to
a
fault
its
certainly
not
sessionable
nor
can
i
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
overall
as
with
hoppin
frog
brews
tons
of
flavor
unique
and
unforgetable
no
other
beer
quite
tastes
like
this
its
liquid
fruit
cake
really
was
fun
to
drink
and
will
have
again
next
christmas
d
a
winter
seasonal
without
any
doubt
a
warm
and
inviting
brew
dominated
by
spices
a
solid
offering
and
one
i
wouldnt
turn
down
if
offered
next
holiday
season
but
not
one
a
i
must
have
next
year
either
solid
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
the
luxurious
mouth
feel
is
the
highlight
o
i
love
this
beer
yes
its
an
extremely
spicy
winter
warmer
but
i
think
they
hit
the
style
dead
on
in
some
parts
if
it
was
a
little
more
malt
forward
to
balanced
it
out
it
would
be
amazing
easy
to
drink
find
and
not
too
badly
priced
i
would
recommend
for
the
holidays
and
probably
drink
12
per
sitting
i
wont
have
this
beer
again
or
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
the
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
smooth
and
chewy
with
ample
carbonation
in
a
medium
body
but
just
a
bit
too
much
bite
o
an
interesting
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
o
wow
was
not
expecting
this
hoppin
frog
has
struck
gold
with
this
beer
as
a
huge
ww
fan
and
of
spiced
beer
in
general
this
brew
is
great
not
much
else
to
say
besides
to
buy
it
if
you
can
find
it
pours
a
caramel
brown
color
slightly
hazy
aroma
of
cinnamon
spice
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
in
the
taste
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
and
nutty
malts
a
touch
of
caramel
and
light
bitterness
chewey
medium
to
full
bodied
feel
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
overall
a
nice
little
winter
warmer
we
did
a
large
christmas
and
winter
beer
tasting
panel
and
this
was
one
of
the
many
that
we
tried
most
of
the
beers
we
tried
we
solid
including
this
one
that
the
panel
liked
tastes
just
like
it
smells
however
things
get
a
bit
cloying
and
some
potpourri
like
flavors
come
through
on
the
finish
again
like
a
liquid
cookie
nice
creamy
middle
just
missing
with
that
potpourri
aroma
given
the
fact
that
22oz
is
enough
and
that
it
is
quite
spicy
tough
to
say
this
is
an
amazing
beer
id
want
to
drink
all
of
the
time
however
if
you
see
it
for
a
reasonable
price
totally
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
this
style
pours
a
dark
brown
w
crimson
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
you
can
manage
to
peek
out
the
other
side
but
just
barely
fairly
clear
from
what
id
expect
very
little
lacing
at
all
on
the
side
of
my
snifter
and
just
a
sliver
of
a
head
to
start
nose
is
pleasantly
festive
with
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
some
ginger
in
there
too
im
not
getting
much
malt
in
the
nose
wow
spice
explosion
on
my
first
sip
holy
cow
thats
strong
big
time
nutmeg
bigger
cinnamon
and
a
hint
of
ginger
and
malt
its
not
bad
its
just
a
tad
bit
over
the
top
for
me
id
also
like
to
see
a
little
more
malt
presence
in
the
taste
feel
is
medium
w
high
carbonation
and
a
sweet
cloying
finish
somebody
needs
to
take
the
edge
off
this
beer
about
25
all
in
all
if
you
dont
like
heavy
spices
you
wont
like
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
good
but
i
probably
wont
look
for
it
again
cheers
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
winter
long
the
brown
sugar
stays
in
your
mouth
for
quite
some
time
without
becoming
overpowering
exceptionally
wellbalanced
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
will
surely
pick
up
a
few
more
before
winter
is
over
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
mix
of
seasonal
spice
sweet
malt
alcohol
licorice
and
slight
medicinal
syrup
blast
of
autumnal
and
winter
spice
up
front
with
lots
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
nutmeg
vailla
clove
pumpkin
and
cardomam
kind
of
earthy
with
some
sweet
makt
underneath
mostly
caramel
with
hints
of
licorice
peppermint
and
dark
fruit
especially
dark
cherry
alcohol
heat
in
the
finish
but
abv
decently
masked
a
bit
heavy
in
the
spice
and
medicinal
flavors
kind
of
smells
and
tastes
like
potpourri
d
this
was
a
lot
like
just
drinking
mulled
cider
without
much
to
distinguish
it
as
beer
still
enjoyable
scent
and
taste
and
well
hidden
alcohol
the
body
was
a
bit
weak
but
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
nice
winter
brew
or
for
christmas
in
july
spicy
with
sage
cardamom
light
fruits
chamomile
ham
juniper
cinnamon
karo
syrup
fizz
paper
edible
flowers
and
leaves
interesting
id
like
to
try
this
again
sometime
and
see
if
anything
has
changed
with
the
recipe
current
or
otherwise
word
word
word
nice
aroma
of
caramel
malts
hints
of
spice
and
touches
of
light
herbal
hops
not
a
heavy
aroma
but
defintley
on
the
winter
tone
with
nice
spice
notes
smooth
creamy
medium
bodied
ale
with
a
nice
carbonation
really
let
the
flavors
pop
intresting
mix
again
of
light
caramel
malts
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
and
a
touch
of
light
grain
a
smooth
deleicate
finish
left
me
looking
for
another
sip
as
the
alcohol
was
all
but
absent
from
the
flavor
o
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
from
hoppin
frog
i
really
enjoyed
the
nose
but
the
taste
wasnt
quite
as
good
and
it
was
a
bit
too
carbonated
would
give
another
shot
poured
into
my
new
belgium
snifter
no
head
to
speak
of
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
its
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
spice
slaps
you
in
the
face
as
soon
as
you
raise
the
glass
wow
pretty
heavy
on
the
cinnamon
ginger
the
spices
follow
into
the
taste
overpowering
any
hops
bitterness
and
only
moderately
detectable
maltiness
this
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
though
its
heavy
on
the
spices
it
doesnt
linger
i
like
the
spice
in
my
winter
warmers
to
complement
the
backbone
of
the
beer
not
become
it
way
too
heavy
on
the
spices
to
give
this
one
a
high
grade
because
even
as
the
beer
warmed
the
spices
became
even
more
pronounced
most
of
the
robust
dark
beers
i
normally
drink
get
better
as
they
warm
but
not
this
one
unfortunately
dreally
overspiced
in
my
opinion
hard
to
get
down
the
first
pint
i
poured
this
could
be
a
drainpour
drinkability
its
definitely
not
for
everybody
even
im
not
exactly
sure
what
to
think
of
it
an
honest
appreciation
for
a
bold
christmastime
spice
character
in
much
the
same
way
southern
tier
pumking
is
heavy
on
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
is
an
absolute
must
no
subtlety
no
delicacy
here
d
i
actually
enjoyed
this
i
drank
the
entire
bomber
over
a
couple
hours
during
a
family
christmas
gathering
and
it
certainly
fit
the
bill
d
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
make
this
one
a
sipper
but
its
an
enjoyable
one
might
look
to
pick
this
up
again
next
christmas
season
d
split
a
bomber
bottle
d
very
drinkable
and
smooth
but
the
elevated
8
6
abv
would
definitly
prohibit
drinking
many
d
no
more
than
1
with
all
those
spices
but
its
fun
nonetheless
picked
up
a
bottle
after
christmas
weekend
by
chance
at
a
local
winebeer
store
this
winter
warmer
is
among
one
of
my
favorite
festive
beer
where
the
essence
of
christmas
is
captured
in
this
very
bottle
perfectly
blended
spices
compliment
frosted
frogs
rich
malt
flavors
creating
the
ultimate
christmas
experience
there
is
plenty
of
cinnamon
with
hints
of
cloves
and
nutmeg
as
well
as
subtle
malty
and
woody
undertones
it
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
dark
mostly
transparent
reddish
mahogany
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
flavor
is
malty
with
a
firm
overtone
of
cinnamon
cloves
and
nutmeg
and
maybe
some
horehound
as
well
there
is
a
bit
of
sharp
candy
sweetness
and
just
a
whisper
of
raw
wood
texture
is
sharp
crisp
and
fizzy
leaving
behind
a
tingly
spicy
finish
aroma
has
a
strong
and
pleasant
spicy
undertone
quite
different
from
any
other
beer
i
have
sampled
even
other
winter
warmers
and
spiced
ales
there
is
plenty
of
cinnamon
with
hints
of
cloves
and
nutmeg
as
well
as
subtle
malty
and
woody
undertones
it
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a

leaving
behind
a
tingly
spicy
finish
happy
holidays
d
im
not
saying
that
this
beer
should
be
avoided
but
its
definitely
not
my
style
if
they
would
hold
back
a
couple
pounds
on
the
spices
i
think
it
would
compete
with
the
other
top
christmas
ales
if
you
really
enjoy
the
spices
that
are
aforementioned
then
by
all
means
get
this
beer
d
a
sipper
and
the
strong
flavor
means
it
would
be
best
in
small
quantities
but
definitely
worthy
overall
had
a
hard
time
finishing
the
glass
but
glad
i
got
to
try
this
would
be
perfect
as
a
4oz
taster
rather
than
a
12oz
glass
i
can
see
where
they
were
going
with
the
different
flavors
here
but
unfortunately
the
combo
of
a
ridiculously
heavy
spice
profile
and
overall
high
alcohol
content
rendered
this
a
pretty
much
undrinkable
mess
a
rare
drain
pour
for
me
d
holy
smokes
this
beer
is
about
as
christmas
as
beers
gets
i
like
it
ok
but
i
couldnt
even
try
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
drinkability
for
sure
a
one
and
done
pretty
intense
with
spices
and
a
bit
overdone
to
be
honest
na

frosted
frog
comes
into
the
glass
looking
bright
brown
hazy
red
with
a
nice
firm
cap
of
browntan
foam
that
left
small
notches
good
retention
frosty
has
a
nose
on
it
this
one
is
a
pungent
sonofabitch
smell
is
christmas
cheer
with
cinnamon
candi
canes
ginger
nutmeg
and
just
a
bunch
of
spice
frosted
travels
up
the
nostrils
taste
takes
a
step
back
from
that
nice
amounts
of
cinnamon
clash
with
the
spices
leaving
a
warming
effect
on
the
tounge
they
dancin
brown
suga
and
some
candy
apple
cant
taste
the
booze
under
the
mound
of
additions
in
this
one
feel
is
a
bold
medium
with
some
staying
power
on
the
mouth
sweet
spicy
and
not
cloying
or
approaching
it
very
approachable
not
spritzy
very
smooth
and
a
coater
on
the
tounge
i
drank
half
a
bottle
and
wanted
more
a
sipper
or
a
gulper
you
decide
d
this
is
one
hell
of
a
winter
warmer
the
spice
is
extremely
bold
in
the
nose
but
not
as
heavy
in
the
taste
one
im
glad
i
tried
and
one
ill
try
again
with
people
on
a
special
occasion
when
it
fits
the
bill
rather
drinkable
i
cant
wait
to
try
their
barrel
aged
christmas
ale
avoid
this
epic
failure
at
all
costs
overall
this
is
an
abysmal
attempt
at
a
beer
if
you
want
your
tastebuds
to
take
a
cinnamon
beating
and
the
idea
of
liquid
redhots
beer
excites
you
then
give
this
a
shot
otherwise
try
any
other
halfway
decent
winter
warmer
that
isnt
spices
just
for
the
sake
of
spices
then
comes
the
taste
are
you
kidding
me
half
a
jar
of
cinnamon
into
some
lightlysweetened
water
carbonate
it
up
a
bit
and
youve
got
frosted
frog
wow
this
is
not
a
goodtasting
beer
i
suppose
aside
from
the
cinnamon
theres
also
a
bit
of
light
spruce
character
either
way
this
is
just
a
cinnamon
bomb
and
basically
unpalatable
son
of
a
lady
frog
does
this
taste
stay
with
me
i
really
cant
get
it
out
of
my
mouth
i
dont
even
know
if
a
shot
of
gin
would
work
at
this
point
mouthfeel
spice
cinnamon
yuck
id
drainpour
the
rest
of
this
bottle
if
amy
didnt
insist
on
drinking
it
all
pours
a
hazy
deep
reddish
to
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
clove
licorice
anise
cinnamon
and
ginger
in
the
taste
big
dry

then
a
mixture
of
spices
and
ends
with

dry

taste
a
cinnamon
spice
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
cinnamon
and
clove
aftertaste
big
spice
but
nice
i
bet
this
would
age
nicely
as
well
as
i
would
love
to
find
the
barrel
aged
version
d
this
is
a
good
brew
overalland
pretty
much
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
winter
warmer
the
spices
dominate
and
there
is
a
slight
warmth
this
reminds
me
of
a
spiced
scotch
ale
very
good
overall
22oz
bottle
from
ale
yeah
in
decatur
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
somewhat
short
head
redolant
of
spices
in
the
nose
nice
cinammon
ginger
and
lesser
nutmeg
aromas
slightly
sweet
in
the
mouth
with
bubblegum
to
start
followed
by
more
spice
particularly
ginger
with
some
cinnamon
and
nutmege
in
equal
parts
and
a
finish
that
has
more
maltiness
quite
nice
for
the
winter
smooth
slightly
sweet
and
a
bit
nutty
on
the
finish
i
enjoyed
this
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
is
medium
the
carbonation
is
low
and
at
times
seems
flat
the
beer
isnt
a
drain
pour
but
not
sure
i
would
repeat
this
beer
again
given
the
choice
between
this
beer
or
anchor
steam
christmas
i
am
rolling
with
anchor
steam
d
very
heavy
on
the
spices
if
you
like
that
youll
like
this
beer
but
it
is
an
acquired
taste
poured
a
bright
amberred
with
a
medium
beige
head
sweet
malt
and
huge
spice
aroma
that
is
mostly
cinnamon
with
a
sprinkle
of
ginger
and
nutmeg
flavor
is
an
absolute
spice
bomb
tastes
like
chewing
on
a
stick
of
big
red
some
ginger
and
light
malty
sweetness
as
well
i
started
liking
spiced
beers
this
year
especially
pumpkin
ales
and
have
always
wondered
whether
there
was
such
a
thing
as
too
much
i
did
like
this
beer
but
it
did
cross
that
line
i
wonder
if
the
ba
frosted
frog
would
settle
down
the
spice
a
little
side
note
as
it
warms
it
really
gets
complex
and
the
different
spices
are
more
evident
drinkability
despite
the
great
taste
the
mouthfeel
kills
it
and
22oz
was
a
lot
to
stomach
d
missed
out
on
this
one
last
year
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
find
it
easy
to
drink
the
price
just
like
most
of
hoppin
frog
is
what
keeps
me
from
coming
back
to
this
one
often
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
were
both
decent
enough
aroma
is
all
sweet
spices
with
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
ginger
all
noticable
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
its
all
spice
unfortunately
thats
not
a
good
thing
because
all
the
spice
just
didnt
agree
with
me
after
a
while
i
think
the
ginger
flavor
in
this
brew
was
way
too
strong
compared
to
the
other
spices
as
the
beer
warmed
up
more
it
seemed
like
the
ginger
just
got
stronger
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
it
seems
a
bit
thin
at
times
and
has
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
below
average
it
certainly
wasnt
enjoyable
to
finish
this
bomber
i
think
if
the
spices
had
more
balance
in
the
flavor
instead
of
being
so
heavy
on
the
ginger
i
would
have
liked
this
beer
more
bottle
poured
a
light
clear
copper
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
is
quite
dominant
and
very
enjoyable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
loads
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
lightly
sweet
malty
backbone
body
is
a
bit
light
for
style
with
average
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
the
spicing
of
this
beer
but
the
malt
presence
was
a
bit
low
for
my
own
taste
i
poured
this
one
into
a
new
belgium
snifter
it
poured
a
dark
dark
burnt
amber
with
a
light
white
head
that
sat
atop
the
brew
the
smell
was
fantastic
it
was
heavy
on
cinnamon
ginger
and
especially
nutmeg
just
as
stated
on
the
bottle
it
also
smelled
slightly
sweet
with
no
alcohol
to
be
found
the
taste
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
the
smell
but
it
was
still
pretty
solid
id
say
its
kind
of
like
a
stronger
brown
ale
with
spices
the
spices
kind
of
overpower
any
traditional
beer
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
great
it
was
medium
bodied
and
drank
very
very
smoothly
overall
id
say
its
pretty
drinkable
it
has
good
flavor
and
goes
down
smooth
i
liked
it
imo
this
is
easily
the
king
of
all
maltier
christmas
beers
just
flavorwise
blows
everything
else
out
of
the
water
and
as
soon
its
distribution
increases
i
am
sure
it
will
catch
on
even
more
d
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
great
holiday
brew
to
have
even
in
august
i
would
get
this
brew
again
but
for
sure
share
with
others
at
times
the
spices
got
a
little
over
whelming
i
do
recommend
this
brew
and
i
will
get
this
again
overall
an
interesting
brew
but
it
tasted
like
they
were
trying
too
hard
i
dont
foresee
myself
buying
this
anytime
soon
that
is
unless
i
cant
find
any
glbc
or
thirsty
dog
this
holiday
season
i
enjoyed
this
change
of
pace
not
too
sweet
the
natural
sweetness
of
cinammon
is
well
blended
by
gingers
pungency
and
some
spice
from
nutmeg
ginger
is
usually
offputting
to
me
with
few
exceptions
this
was
one
too
much
for
one
to
finish
the
bomber
the
mouthfeel
is
easy
and
it
is
not
thick
the
beer
smelled
winter
warmer
may
have
enjoyed
it
more
at
a
supper
drinkabilitythis
is
a
fantastic
christmas
ale
i
taste
it
and
am
transported
to
the
hottub
in
a
gingerbread
house
unusual
and
tasty
spiced
ale
its
a
wow
beer
for
sure
hoppin
frog
frosted
frog
christmas
ale
is
a
solid
xmas
brew
that
is
at
least
as
good
as
this
brewerys
other
seasonal
frogs
hollow
double
pumpkin
ale
it
isnt
as
good
as
great
lakes
brewing
companys
classic
but
its
definitely
worth
a
single
bomber
purchase
every
holiday
season
cheers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
very
good
the
spices
get
to
me
after
just
drinking
a
small
amount
i
wish
i
had
about
8oz
of
it
instead
of
22
could
be
a
nice
desert
beer
with
the
right
pairing
though
if
you
like
cinnamon
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
otherwise
very
delicious
but
perhaps
misclassified
thanks
to
travita
for
sharing
this
bottle
the
beer
pours
medium
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
strong
gingerbread
cookies
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
it
smells
like
christmas
the
flavor
is
more
gingerbread
with
some
great
cookie
flavored
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
not
sure
how
they
did
it
but
they
made
a
beer
taste
exactly
like
you
are
eating
gingerbread
cookies
very
happy
i
got
to
try
this
one
bomber
from
chucks
in
chagrin
falls
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
from
the
mouthfeel
but
for
a
8
spiced
winter
warmer
its
about
average
id
recommend
sharing
this
with
someone
22oz
is
a
bit
much
on
its
own
i
know
this
isnt
everyones
cup
of
tea
but
it
is
a
very
spicy
festive
spice
that
is
beer
that
is
balanced
yet
strongly
flavored
spiced
beers
are
hard
to
get
right
and
this
one
is
pretty
close
i
couldnt
taste
the
abv
at
all
and
if
you
dont
mind
inyourface
pumpkin
pie
flavors
this
one
is
for
you
as
it
was
for
me
pours
a
slightly
murky
ruby
and
copper
color
with
a
small
and
super
quick
head
and
faintly
syrupy
looking
consistancy
the
aroma
is
holy
christmas
cinnamon
nutmeg
cardamon
ginger
and
mace
blast
the
nostrils
every
sip
maybe
some
caramel
malts
hidden
away
in
the
aroma
down
there
the
aroma
is
good
but
a
touch
too
much
on
the
spices
the
taste
is
full
frontal
assault
of
spices
that
last
through
all
of
the
fron
most
of
the
middle
and
mellows
out
on
the
finish
some
sweet
biscuit
malts
peak
through
the
xmas
spice
haze
on
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
really
adds
some
fire
to
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
especially
in
the
back
of
the
throat
this
beer
is
good
for
christmas
only
i
could
only
drink
one
bottle
once
a
year
and
thats
it
thank
you
but
hey
if
you
like
spiced
beers
this
might
be
for
you
i
take
another
sip
just
to
judge
mouthfeel
thankfully
this
beer
is
cold
enough
that
it
probably
inhibits
some
flavor
it
feels
like
old
candy
its
sweet
and
evergreen
piney
with
a
dose
of
christmas
breadspice
its
the
egg
nog
of
beers
do
you
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
egg
nog
i
had
to
plug
the
opening
with
my
thumb
and
shake
it
up
a
bit
to
develop
a
nice
two
finger
sized
head
pours
with
a
deep
ruby
mahogany
brown
hue
with
khaki
tan
head
forming
with
slow
gurgling
bubbles
fine
speckled
lacing
layers
itself
pretty
evenly
between
sips
pretty
attractive
winter
warmer
meant
for
my
piraat
chalice
aromatics
deep
pie
spice
including
cinnamon
ginger
and
nutmeg
with
a
slight
citrus
orange
peel
finish
caramel
sweetness
is
detected
easily
with
minimal
well
hidden
booze
in
trace
amounts
across
my
nares
the
flavor
is
more
pie
spicing
with
caramel
mild
chocolate
brown
sugar
glazed
custard
creamy
tones
a
touch
of
citrus
amongst
the
nutmeg
ginger
and
cinnamon
this
is
actually
pretty
damn
enjoyable
i
have
to
admit
the
first
few
sips
i
felt
were
cloying
until
my
palate
adjusted
and
i
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
mouthfeel
has
a
very
balanced
carbonation
level
rides
smooth
carrying
spices
and
a
creamy
textured
body
without
difficulty
fuller
bodied
slow
steady
finish
of
alcohol
burn
that
is
really
hidden
compared
to
most
of
the
winter
ales
available
these
days
drinkability
overall
this
one
is
a
bit
festive
and
after
working
12
hours
on
christmas
day
theres
no
better
way
to
celebrate
the
beginning
of
a
long
weekend
then
by
sipping
on
a
fine
spiced
winter
warmer
out
of
akron
oh
amen
halleleujgah
wassail
wtf
medium
body
good
carbonation
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
this
has
a
very
nice
christmas
cookie
feel
to
it
most
certainly
a
winter
sipper
almost
a
perfect
match
to
go
with
oatmeal
raisin
cookies
frosted
frog
is
an
impressive
winter
warmer
i
like
it
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
i
do
think
theres
slightly
too
much
cinnamon
but
theres
not
too
much
else
to
gripe
about
great
lakes
christmas
ale
has
been
my
favorite
of
the
season
for
a
while
frosted
frog
doesnt
change
that
but
its
certainly
a
contender
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
at
least
a
couple
of
bombers
annually
definitely
check
it
out
if
you
have
the
opportunity
merry
christmas
drinkability
a
great
beer
while
were
making
final
preps
for
christmas
09
merry
christmas
to
all
and
to
all
a
good
pint
o
this
is
what
a
christmas
ale
should
be
completely
different
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
year
round
brew
with
some
minor
changes
this
one
is
very
unique
and
very
good
d
i
recommend
sharing
this
with
a
few
folks
as
i
mentioned
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
too
thin
and
the
low
carbonation
adversely
affects
the
drinkability
d
im
going
to
call
this
the
best
xmas
ale
ive
had
this
season
fantastic
beer
this
beer
needs
to
be
aged
and
it
would
be
more
enjoyable
its
a
great
beer
to
share
during
the
holidays
though
drinkability
moderately
high
even
though
the
abv
is
8
6
im
really
digging
the
flavors
and
this
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
spices
are
a
little
heavy
when
considering
drinkability
but
a
a
bottle
of
this
would
be
perfect
for
sipping
around
the
holidays
d
well
i
remember
my
dad
telling
me
that
if
youre
going
to
do
something
do
it
all
the
way
and
that
is
certainly
what
these
guys
did
if
youre
looking
for
a
big
ass
winter
warmer
here
you
go
its
very
drinkable
indeed
just
be
aware
of
the
high
abv
a
great
beer
from
hoppin
frog
this
has
been
a
good
year
with
ba
boris
hopmasters
abbey
and
now
this
all
serving
as
excellent
representations
of
their
styles
cheers
and
happy
holidays
fred
karm
and
crew
d
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
have
to
say
im
impressed
really
does
taste
like
what
i
can
only
describe
as
christmas
looking
forward
to
having
this
one
again
and
again
and
again
interesting
beer
but
you
had
better
want
lots
of
spice
most
of
the
beer
flavors
are
obscured
just
about
the
most
heavily
spiced
beer
i
have
yet
tasted
excluding
cave
creek
chile
beer
i
bought
this
for
7
99
which
is
pretty
decent
for
a
bomber
in
these
parts
but
uh
im
just
gonna
go
find
a
cash
machine
so
i
can
buy
some
more
fred
has
a
real
winner
here
seek
this
one
out
and
hope
that
you
have
friends
in
ohio
this
year
to
hook
you
up
this
holiday
beer
rocks
very
cool
label
with
frosted
frog
complete
with
santa
hat
nicely
done
pours
dark
bronze
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
aroma
is
straight
cinnamon
with
some
ginger
and
candy
flavor
is
very
spicy
cinnamon
maybe
too
much
it
gets
easier
to
drink
as
it
warms
nice
mouthfeel
and
body
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
wont
replace
great
lakes
as
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
8
bucks
is
too
much
for
a
bomber
hoppin
frog
makes
some
of
the
boldest
beers
in
the
area
and
they
dont
seem
to
shy
away
from
serving
up
intensity
this
is
one
of
there
better
concoctions
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
bodied
with
a
small
bite
of
bubbly
carbonation
very
nice
o
found
it
on
wishbeer
bkk
that
was
the
best
part
its
taste
just
was
not
up
to
par
in
my
opinion
so
many
components
remind
me
of
the
mass
produced
china
macro
brown
ales
ive
had
so
i
feel
disappointed
great
label
on
the
bottle
though
that
was
certainly
not
china
produced
good
christmas
ale
with
cinnamon
coming
through
overall
going
off
the
only
info
i
could
find
regarding
wychwoods
bottling
date
apparently
the
a3efg
code
corresponds
to
it
having
been
been
brewed
sometime
in
2013
considering
how
muted
and
watery
this
beer
is
id
say
thats
probably
likely
and
id
venture
to
guess
somewhere
around
15
months
old
not
good
for
a
beer
thats
only
5
abv
a
shame
i
hadnt
caught
this
before
i
bought
it
pours
a
reddishdark
amber
in
color
with
about
a
good
halffinger
offwhite
creamy
head
some
light
sheets
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
spice
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
some
dark
fruits
caramel
yeast
and
toffee
in
the
mix
as
well
a
slightly
dry
hoppy
finish
was
noticed
but
didnt
last
too
long
at
all
winter
warmer
style
brews
have
been
all
over
the
board
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
received
this
as
a
present
on
christmas
day
and
its
certainly
the
second
best
beer
ive
been
given
on
that
holiest
of
days
anyway
its
definitely
a
great
looking
beer
with
a
pleasing
scent
of
malts
what
i
also
enjoyed
was
the
brews
smoothness
silkier
than
silk
and
it
helped
mask
the
strong
almost
too
overpowering
taste
of
the
hops
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
expected
for
an
ale
overall
it
a
really
good
beer
and
i
really
like
getting
the
larger
bottles
so
friends
keep
them
coming
overall
i
figured
that
id
save
this
one
for
christmas
eve
so
i
did
my
preferences
are
more
towards
the
malt
end
of
the
spectrum
but
even
so
this
one
might
be
a
tad
overdone
that
said
it
is
marketed
as
a
winter
ale
and
it
hits
the
bullseye
there
good
but
not
amazingly
so
serving
type
bottle
500ml
bottle
4
99
i
used
to
love
hobgoblin
so
i
thought
this
would
be
nice
and
festive
dark
amber
color
good
head
aroma
is
sort
of
malt
vinegar
which
i
get
from
english
beers
sometime
not
a
sour
vinegar
flavor
is
malt
malt
malt
and
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
not
really
a
christmas
ale
missing
the
spices
but
an
enjoyable
dark
ale
a
fine
offering
from
wychwood
the
taste
has
the
same
malt
sweetness
as
the
aroma
suggests
but
with
a
touch
of
cardboard
in
the
mix
that
could
be
due
to
the
age
of
this
beer
which
was
probably
not
meant
to
be
had
78
months
after
it
came
out
o
ok
for
the
holidays
overall
the
first
thing
that
is
evident
is
that
this
bottle
is
past
its
prime
and
im
sure
a
brewery
fresh
pint
would
be
rather
festive
to
drink
that
being
said
im
drinking
this
on
march
31st
during
a
raging
blizzard
when
spring
is
supposed
to
be
springing
and
to
that
i
say
bah
humbug
average
a
bit
more
body
higher
abv
content
and
a
dash
more
cinnamon
may
have
made
it
more
interesting
or
maybe
i
dont
have
the
xmas
spirit
anymore
food
match
the
tears
of
a
grinch
let
the
xmas
beers
begin
and
pours
a
light
hazed
copper
hue
with
a
creamy
three
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
vanillastrong
cinnamonbananna
and
dried
fruits
not
expecting
much
from
the
smell
of
things
and
the
feel
doesnt
get
much
better
which
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
the
tastes
are
pretty
much
the
same
as
hobgoblin
with
cinamon
added
and
overall
no
this
not
for
me
cheers
alright
beer
and
could
imagine
it
being
popular
in
the
mainstream
at
christmas
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
o
i
think
this
is
my
first
winter
warmer
and
i
quite
enjoyed
this
throughout
the
aroma
and
flavor
was
way
off
from
what
i
first
expected
and
i
found
this
fairly
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
final
grade
3
52
a
passable
b
grade
wychwoods
bah
humbug
is
a
rather
plain
winter
warmer
but
theres
nothing
inherently
bad
about
or
even
wrong
with
it
the
flavour
is
balanced
but
mild
with
a
gentle
brushing
of
fruity
spice
and
a
finishaftertaste
that
really
ties
the
profile
together
unfortunately
its
just
too
light
to
have
the
same
complexity
and
rich
inviting
features
that
my
favourite
warmers
tend
to
have
a
serviceable
englishstyle
ale
for
the
autumn
and
winter
months
overall
first
of
the
style
ive
tried
but
overall
was
pretty
enjoyable
was
expecting
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
bold
flavors
but
would
definitely
consider
a
repurchase
overall
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
but
it
is
drinkable
just
an
average
beer
and
a
slight
let
down
from
its
apperance
and
packaging
o
a
solid
winter
ale
with
a
decent
flavour
profile
and
an
english
ale
backbone
which
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
session
ale
a
tasty
christmas
treat
indeed
overall
good
for
a
seasonal
winter
warmer
wouldnt
be
a
regular
and
there
are
better
winter
ales
but
this
is
good
reminiscent
of
fruit
cake
caramelized
ripe
fruit
would
only
get
in
winter
traditional
makes
me
think
only
the
english
would
create
it
overall
similar
to
the
bulk
of
wychwoods
products
for
me
fine
but
not
particularly
good
and
not
something
i
would
return
to
bah
not
good
at
all
this
could
ruin
your
christmas
a
vile
cloying
aroma
of
bananas
pervades
this
ale
too
sweet
with
an
unbalanced
fruitiness
that
lacks
balance
from
the
malt
finishes
with
a
harsh
stewed
bitterness
that
is
equally
unpleasant
the
spice
is
also
rather
lacklustre
in
short
not
much
to
enjoy
here
there
are
other
beers
out
there
give
this
a
miss
bah
humbug
indeed
od
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
considering
how
good
this
beer
looks
but
it
ends
up
tasting
quite
good
in
the
end
so
it
gets
a
passing
grade
if
you
dont
mind
a
beer
heavy
on
the
malts
this
one
is
plenty
drinkable
the
cinnamon
is
a
subtle
twist
and
doesnt
get
in
the
way
i
would
have
preferred
additional
roasted
tones
or
hop
bitterness
but
on
a
cold
christmas
night
i
cant
argue
with
the
winter
warmer
classification
httpabarwithnoname

com
m
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
final
thoughts
bah
humbug
indeed
this
beer
is
a
surprising
disappointment
from
wychwood
i
mean
there
isnt
a
lot
here
i
can
recommend
other
then
the
beer
and
the
bottle
looks
nice
nowhere
near
as
good
as
hobgoblin
or
fiddlers
elbow
which
seems
to
have
disappeared
in
ontario
and
from
their
website
youll
want
to
pass
not
the
big
hitter
i
had
expected
in
the
taste
stakes
o
one
of
my
first
craft
beers
and
still
one
of
my
holiday
favorites
i
wasnt
horribly
impressed
but
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
not
as
smooth
or
vanillainfused
as
say
my
current
local
favourites
gi
winter
ale
or
tree
vertical
winter
ale
but
it
still
has
all
the
necessary
delicious
christmas
spices
in
there
it
just
didnt
pack
the
punch
i
was
hoping
for
so
i
personally
wont
likely
be
buying
it
again
this
is
the
first
brew
i
have
enjoyed
from
this
brewery
and
it
is
worth
another
try
overall
good
winter
warmer
definately
much
better
than
gi
winter
ale
but
im
sure
ill
have
better
this
christmas
season
or
should
i
say
christmas
saison
ha
i
crack
me
up
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
not
a
lot
of
actual
warming
given
its
rather
mild
abv
and
i
find
it
a
bit
too
syrupy
overall
however
its
a
nice
crisptasting
and
fruity
ale
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
i
would
definatley
buy
this
beer
again
the
cinnamon
flavour
stays
in
your
mouth
it
looks
good
love
the
bottle
even
though
its
considered
a
winter
warmer
i
find
it
refreshing
and
could
drink
this
all
year
round
pours
an
almost
opaque
burgundy
with
a
finger
or
two
cap
of
cream
coloured
head
bubbly
retention
and
similar
denser
lacing
nose
is
faint
some
caramel
malts
a
bit
of
butter
shades
of
darker
fruits
and
darker
breads
taste
follows
some
lightly
buttered
dark
breads
some
mild
spicing
maybe
some
cinnamon
some
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
notes
but
some
bitterness
in
there
as
well
dry
finish
medium
body
soft
carbonation
that
is
suited
to
this
beer
relatively
drinkable
but
fairly
uninteresting
throughout
certainly
a
step
up
from
the
samuel
smith
winter
welcome
i
had
earlier
but
im
still
gonna
stick
with
st
peters
winter
ale
as
my
choice
winter
warmer
from
over
the
pond
d
a
very
solid
winter
warmer
that
satisfies
but
lacks
complexity
still
a
good
sipper
for
these
cold
nights
in
and
an
excellent
lowspice
segue
from
plain
ales
to
the
more
aggressively
spiced
winter
warmers
overall
one
of
the
better
holiday
themed
beers
ive
tried
so
far
the
taste
was
very
pleasant
and
not
cloying
in
any
ways
ill
grab
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
and
probably
look
for
it
again
during
future
holiday
seasons
d
a
delicious
dark
mid
winter
ale
to
sip
during
the
short
winter
days
andor
long
winter
evenings
this
beer
is
muddy
orange
in
color
with
red
amber
hues
the
500
ml
bottle
pours
nicely
into
my
guinness
pint
glass
leaving
a
a
head
twofingers
thick
on
top
the
head
eventually
drops
to
a
lace
then
towards
the
bottom
nothing
but
a
few
whispers
of
lace
sticking
to
the
glass
its
all
butterscotch
and
soft
yeast
in
the
nose
which
all
by
itself
is
nice
but
a
kick
of
sovent
alcohol
takes
the
enjoyment
down
a
little
the
same
applies
to
the
taste
butterscoth
and
nutty
flavors
run
around
but
the
alcohol
isnt
shy
of
showing
itself
tasted
blind
i
would
have
guessed
more
along
the
lines
of
an
esb
than
a
winter
warmer
all
said
solid
beer
overall
a
good
but
not
outstanding
winter
beer
those
looking
for
the
coffee
bitternessmild
hop
kick
found
in
american
winter
warmers
which
i
do
like
will
not
find
it
here
still
worth
a
shot
for
fans
of
the
style
though
it
is
the
richness
though
that
i
seek
from
this
sort
of
beer
so
while
i
did
enjoy
what
i
drank
i
was
hoping
for
that
big
red
firetruck
for
christmas
not
the
socks
and
underwear
which
were
probably
more
practical
eh
not
bad
this
is
a
brown
bottle
thats
been
sitting
out
for
a
couple
three
years
poured
with
a
nice
fine
creamy
head
that
slowly
settles
down
color
is
a
cloudy
brown
with
garnet
highlights
aroma
is
malt
caramel
toffee
maybe
a
bit
of
wet
cardboard
flavors
like
aroma
not
overly
sweet
no
cinammon
in
nose
but
perhaps
a
smidgen
in
the
finish
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
alcohol
in
the
finish
too
drinkable
overall
its
a
good
beer
a
little
one
sided
on
the
cinnamon
front
and
too
light
bodied
for
my
liking
though
the
bottle
filled
my
glass
with
a
pale
copper
which
in
turn
filled
my
nose
with
cinnamon
dry
fruits
butterscotch
and
caramel
the
taste
is
very
similar
hints
of
cinnamon
dry
fruits
creamy
butterscotch
diactyl
whatever
it
works
caramel
and
vanilla
bah
humbug
has
an
even
finish
smooth
good
presence
in
the
mouth
only
downside
for
me
is
a
touch
too
much
co2
d
very
drinkable
brew
a
step
or
two
up
from
the
macros
and
a
nice
winter
seasonal
smells
lightly
spiced
cinammon
english
toffee
sweet
aromas
up
front
taste
of
caramel
is
most
pronounced
some
sweet
dark
fruit
lowmedium
bitterness
and
malty
finish
chewy
mouthfeel
hints
of
christmas
cake
rather
on
the
smooth
side
for
a
beer
named
after
scrooge
overall
not
bad
at
all
and
a
suitable
christmas
beer
regardless
of
what
calendar
you
follow
i
had
out
of
a
25
ounce
bottle
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
brown
basically
opaque
it
has
a
ton
of
sediment
that
its
practically
gelatinous
it
has
a
strong
alcohol
malt
scent
and
like
the
scent
its
very
malty
very
alcoholly
almost
portwineish
it
has
kind
of
a
brownie
taste
not
that
spicy
for
a
christmas
ale
but
flavorful
nice
label
though
its
a
cloudy
dark
brown
that
produces
head
that
dissipates
quickly
its
aroma
is
rather
lackluster
some
simple
malts
and
a
touch
of
sugar
when
i
taste
it
i
just
get
this
feeling
of
generic
brown
ale
its
got
some
weight
and
body
but
nothing
distinctive
it
finishes
good
but
it
just
wasnt
worth
the
wychwood
price
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
just
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
pours
a
slightly
hazed
copper
topped
by
a
finger
and
half
of
beige
head
mediocre
head
retention
and
spotty
lace
big
brown
sugar
aroma
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
nuts
tastes
of
toffee
dried
fruit
cinnamon
and
nuts
slightly
sweet
and
reminiscent
of
fruitcake
mild
earthy
floral
bitterness
in
the
finish
lightbodied
with
low
carbonation
feels
thin
it
has
a
nice
flavour
to
it
but
could
use
a
little
more
heft
while
a
nicely
balanced
and
enjoyable
english
ale
thats
all
there
seems
to
be
to
it
the
promise
of
the
packaging
gone
up
in
the
fireplaces
smoke
metaphorically
singing
poor
ol
st
nicks
sexy
backside
something
with
this
outward
attitude
needs
to
show
it
on
the
inside
as
well
otherwise
its
more
of
a
meh
humbug
for
this
dreamer
this
is
drinkable
but
not
one
ill
be
buying
again
its
labeled
as
a
christmas
ale
but
the
taste
is
too
all
over
the
place
also
for
a
christmas
ale
id
prefer
something
a
little
stronger
there
is
no
warming
with
this
one
at
5
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
ale
that
is
not
particularly
special
d
considering
the
version
im
trying
is
only
5
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
on
this
one
the
cinnamon
might
get
a
bit
boring
after
a
few
bottles
though
worth
a
go
definately
try
it
pours
a
opaque
caramel
color
with
a
large
tan
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
nothing
wrong
with
the
look
of
this
winter
warmer
i
was
surprised
by
the
amount
of
hops
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
wonderful
english
hops
give
a
floral
and
herbal
aroma
complimented
by
the
malt
that
smells
like
caramel
nice
hop
and
malt
flavor
the
hops
gives
some
herbal
and
earthy
notes
the
malt
toffee
bitterness
is
low
to
moderate
the
body
is
where
this
beer
is
let
down
surprised
by
how
thin
and
watery
it
was
although
it
might
aid
drinkability
it
does
not
feel
substantial
enough
for
a
hearty
winter
warmer
update
drain
pour
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
its
pretty
mediocre
worth
a
try
nice
and
malty
on
a
grey
late
autumn
day
but
just
not
quite
robust
enough
d
i
think
this
is
to
weak
in
all
aspects
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
have
any
reason
to
buy
another
also
to
add
this
beer
states
5
and
not
6
as
ba
says
overall
yeah
i
kind
of
dont
mind
this
its
a
very
english
tasting
christmas
beer
a
good
start
to
the
christmas
beer
season
cant
wait
to
pick
up
more
holiday
brews
if
youre
looking
for
a
decent
christmas
ale
bah
humbug
is
worth
a
go
rather
disappointed
in
this
beer
aroma
is
nonexistent
colour
is
orange
amber
with
slightly
off
white
head
taste
is
fairly
bland
some
spice
and
malt
in
the
taste
with
the
flavours
coming
out
mostly
in
the
aftertaste
the
initial
mouthfeel
is
non
existent
overall
this
beer
is
lackluster
and
i
really
wont
revisit
this
next
year
d
very
quaffable
beer
and
a
perfect
brew
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
day
in
front
of
the
fireplace
or
just
while
watching
a
movie
it
would
make
an
excellent
dessert
beer
as
well
but
i
dont
think
id
be
able
to
drink
several
of
these
together
i
will
however
purchase
this
one
to
enjoy
on
christmas
day
and
will
get
it
again
in
the
future
greate
beer
great
taste
the
lable
and
the
name
suits
the
brew
neat
idea
and
certainly
better
than
the
pumpkin
spiced
beers
i
have
tried
not
a
fan
of
the
pumpkin
pie
looks
predigested
worth
a
try
and
i
could
certainy
drink
more
than
1
that
said
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
if
i
ever
found
this
at
a
bar
i
would
definately
order
one
or
two
im
excited
for
this
years
batch
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
2
finger
thick
of
white
foam
head
that
lasted
about
5mins
it
left
a
thin
layer
and
clung
very
well
to
the
sides
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
hints
of
brown
sugar
oranges
and
cloves
also
picked
up
some
yeast
and
malts
taste
was
spicy
sweet
oranges
nutmeg
and
cloves
felt
solid
in
the
mouth
coated
well
and
nicely
carbonated
a
bit
of
kick
on
the
toungue
a
little
strong
to
drink
definitely
a
sipper
the
taste
is
largely
as
above
with
a
mild
hoppy
bite
and
a
fruity
finish
its
lighter
than
some
winter
warmes
in
body
yet
still
pretty
solid
and
has
an
engaging
liveliness
came
across
a
bottle
of
this
one
this
afternoon
and
decided
it
was
time
to
give
it
a
try
i
received
it
as
a
christmas
present
this
past
year
and
have
to
say
it
was
one
heck
of
a
nice
gift
you
have
to
appreciate
the
label
artwork
not
sure
what
exactly
i
was
expecting
from
this
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
from
the
get
go
poured
into
a
traditional
english
pint
glass
pours
a
smooth
sandalwood
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
the
nose
is
sweet
candylike
a
bit
of
licorice
and
honey
the
first
sip
is
pleasingly
sweet
too
with
the
same
mix
of
licorice
and
honey
almost
like
a
bitohoney
candy
the
finish
is
soft
smooth
and
warming
which
you
would
come
to
expect
from
any
good
winter
ale
definitely
a
beer
you
can
sit
an
enjoy
on
a
cold
winter
day
or
with
any
hearty
dinner
stew
potroast
etc
coincidently
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
wychwood
beer
after
this
selection
it
will
certainly
not
be
my
last
i
wasnt
really
interested
in
a
winter
warmer
but
since
i
have
it
in
the
house
and
its
april
1
i
figured
i
better
drink
it
soon
but
then
i
tasted
it
leave
it
to
wychwood
to
always
make
a
good
beer
i
find
they
excel
at
making
complex
tasting
beers
that
are
perfectly
balanced
this
one
tastes
a
lot
like
twizzlers
but
its
also
bitter
and
somehow
theres
no
clashing
at
all
the
flavor
evolves
in
the
mouth
in
a
perfectly
logical
fashion
one
of
the
better
wychwood
offerings
that
ive
tried
although
thats
faint
praise
if
you
like
winter
warmers
and
you
like
the
english
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
combinations
of
the
two
this
is
not
the
best
warmer
by
any
means
but
there
is
something
about
it
so
comforting
so
appealing
and
so
damn
drinkable
that
i
went
back
to
my
local
distributor
and
bought
out
the
rest
they
had
in
stock
taste
has
alot
of
the
toasty
sweet
cola
and
mineral
flavors
that
are
in
the
nose
i
dont
get
much
of
a
christmas
feel
from
this
beer
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
but
the
unfermentable
sugars
are
a
bit
much
for
me
nothing
particularly
excites
me
about
the
brew
i
think
i
will
say
bah
humbug
and
pass
on
purchasing
this
one
next
year
drinkability
very
nice
english
ale
happy
that
the
ale
is
not
over
powered
by
spice
flavors
when
theyre
too
strong
they
tend
to
ruin
the
beer
definitely
nice
for
a
cold
winters
night
this
beer
has
a
dark
amber
color
and
a
opaque
appearance
that
doesnt
let
much
light
through
it
has
a
slight
scent
where
you
can
smell
the
spices
likewise
the
taste
is
not
all
that
exciting
you
can
definitely
taste
the
hops
first
and
then
the
spices
the
beer
is
not
carbonated
that
much
either
overall
it
is
ok
to
drink
though
probably
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
a
fine
and
easy
going
sipper
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sam
adams
honey
porter
it
is
a
great
beer
and
a
must
try
for
the
winter
months
overall
a
solid
winter
warmer
id
probably
say
this
ranks
right
in
the
middle
of
all
of
the
winter
warmers
i
have
had
i
really
like
some
wychwood
beers
this
ones
good
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
not
going
to
bring
me
back
id
be
more
likely
to
try
some
others
of
the
style
to
see
where
this
one
fits
and
to
see
if
there
are
any
in
the
style
that
make
me
want
to
come
back
for
another
a
cloudy
neutral
light
brown
little
off
white
head
with
a
nice
lacing
but
brief
retention
still
overall
caramel
and
vanilla
nose
little
bitterness
in
the
scent
the
taste
is
similar
a
sweet
affair
the
aftertaste
is
blessed
with
a
mild
nuttiness
and
quenched
by
a
light
dry
bitterness
fuller
than
most
browns
but
poor
retention
offsets
this
positive
i
found
it
to
be
on
par
with
a
northern
brown
similar
to
newcastle
in
quality
well
maybe
newcastle
10
years
ago
certainly
not
potent
or
special
enough
to
be
up
there
with
the
best
winter
warmerschristmas
ales
especially
not
at
the
price
i
paid
pours
a
light
amber
hue
small
head
with
a
sticky
lasting
lace
smells
very
malty
same
stickiness
as
the
palate
taste
is
almost
early
spring
beer
lots
of
sour
malt
some
mild
caramel
little
carbonation
passable
but
i
enjoyed
it
would
try
again
delicious
and
eminently
drinkable
this
is
a
fine
warmer
one
id
like
to
see
improved
but
one
ill
try
again
good
stuff
i
was
quite
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
note
that
there
seems
to
be
quite
a
variation
in
the
scoring
on
ba
maybe
the
6
brew
was
better
m
medium
heavy
body
thick
meaty
mouthfeel
very
good
coating
frothy
carbonation
like
drinking
a
highly
frothed
coffee
drink
i
was
pleased
this
was
not
in
a
clear
bottle
i
was
not
pleased
with
the
overall
result
however
poured
dark
and
murky
not
in
a
good
way
head
retention
was
average
it
did
not
smell
spoiled
but
for
some
reason
did
have
a
harsh
aroma
of
apples
and
fruit
certainly
palatable
it
did
have
a
decent
maltiness
to
it
bready
as
it
warmed
nothing
really
to
distinguish
it
worth
a
try
i
suppose
would
want
to
try
it
on
tap
to
see
the
difference
mouthfeel
medium
watery
with
a
slightly
coarse
dry
finish
low
carbonation
makes
it
go
down
smoothly
very
nice
winter
brew
will
have
again
quite
a
pleasant
winter
warmer
its
not
as
spicy
as
i
would
expect
but
the
added
sweetness
caramel
and
cinnamon
combine
to
create
a
very
pleasant
drink
to
relax
with
on
a
winters
evening
i
liked
this
a
winter
beer
for
sure
great
to
sit
back
and
sip
on
unfortunatly
this
year
though
the
lcbos
ontario
liqour
stores
shippment
of
this
seasonal
beer
offered
it
at
only
5
abv
two
years
ago
it
was
6
then
last
year
5
3
now
5
still
a
good
beer
just
dont
like
it
when
breweries
change
recipes
of
good
brews
pours
an
amber
chestnut
brown
with
a
foamy
yellowish
head
aroma
dominated
by
cinnamon
and
spice
smooth
drinking
with
a
very
interesting
mix
of
flavors
nice
maltiness
with
flavor
of
cherries
banana
and
a
nice
bitter
cinnamon
finish
taste
is
heavy
on
the
malt
with
lots
of
christmas
spice
the
cinnamon
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
candied
fruits
are
prevalent
tipping
the
balance
towards
too
sweet
for
me
thats
not
to
say
there
isnt
a
light
herbal
bitterness
that
attempts
to
balance
but
this
is
more
dessert
than
anything
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
and
the
carbonation
is
low
in
the
british
way
its
nonoffensive
but
its
still
a
bit
seet
for
my
liking
and
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
high
the
carbonation
was
medium
to
low
good
combination
this
beer
was
enjoyable
as
it
warmed
up
a
bit
i
had
this
with
dessert
cheesecake
and
it
went
pretty
well
with
something
so
sweet
overall
get
the
picture
i
imagine
they
took
regular
old
hobgoblin
and
added
some
cinnamon
to
the
kettle
the
older
version
was
6
alcohol
but
this
was
5
i
recall
really
enjoying
the
old
version
a
lot
more
this
one
is
more
drinkable
but
not
as
christmasy
in
flavour
as
the
previous
version
a
pretty
damn
good
spiced
ale
d
a
nice
drinking
and
well
balance
christmas
ale
with
a
nice
maltiness
and
well
balanced
spiciness
perfect
for
the
winter
night
pours
a
clear
brown
color
big
foamy
head
big
bubbles
some
lacing
but
quickly
diminishing
malty
sweet
somewhat
nutty
aroma
maybe
tree
bark
or
fruit
rinds
not
very
pleasant
slight
bitter
beginning
taste
nutty
middle
taste
clean
aftertaste
somewhat
watery
that
same
rind
aroma
is
present
in
the
taste
almost
a
smoky
smell
quickly
diminishing
in
flavor
some
spices
maybe
pumpkin
or
falllike
okay
got
this
as
a
joke
gift
from
one
of
my
aunts
last
christmas
this
one
was
pretty
disappointing
to
me
i
see
it
had
pretty
good
reviews
here
but
i
had
trouble
finishing
it
seemed
like
it
was
unbalanced
and
was
hard
to
even
finish
the
taste
was
very
bland
and
paltry
as
well
i
would
not
want
to
try
this
one
again
great
english
christmas
ale
d
alot
better
than
i
expected
nice
holiday
flavor
and
just
low
enough
on
the
alcohol
level
to
keep
this
within
the
sessionable
limits
i
will
definitely
be
having
a
few
more
of
these
this
winter
fairly
easy
to
drink
yet
one
is
enough
thank
you
poured
with
a
firm
sturdy
foamed
up
head
the
head
look
like
a
guinness
deep
amber
color
smelled
a
bit
oxidized
spiciness
and
malt
sweetness
cinnamon
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
hard
candy
i
can
not
recall
which
one
a
very
candyish
flavor
a
bit
of
hops
also
smooth
almost
nitro
like
mouthfeel
a
pretty
good
warmer
more
to
it
than
i
expected
really
drinkability
relatively
easy
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
light
but
very
apparent
alcoholic
taste
as
well
as
mild
hops
gives
it
its
only
kick
going
down
balanced
hops
and
carbonation
thrust
the
sweet
malty
flavors
to
the
foreground
of
this
offering
a
smooth
drinking
beer
that
is
soft
on
the
mouth
and
easy
to
consume
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
english
beer
and
not
winter
warmers
but
this
one
is
tasty
i
feel
like
this
one
can
be
enjoyed
year
round
and
is
quite
refreshing
d
fine
but
not
very
enticing

dissipates
quickly

very
malty

but
not

smells
like

very
smooth
mouthfeel
again
not
spicy
like
you
would
expect
from
a

but
rather
malty
flavor
that
is
accompanied
by
a
very
light
hoppy

drinkability
is
very
high
goes
down
very
smooth
md
light
to

pours
a

with

not

aroma
is
weak
first
taste
feels
a
bit
thin
it
does
get
better
with
some
reasonable
maltiness
and
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
aftertaste
surprisingly
light
for
6
maroon
colored
poor
with
a
short
lived
head
smell
was
of
sweet
and
sourish
malt
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
tart
with
a
light
bitter
kick
in
the
finish
kind
of
like
slighly
burnt
caramel
and
reminded
me
almost
of
an
esb
perhaps
the
faintest
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
this
one
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
and
i
upped
it
from
2
5
to
3
overall
interesting
as
a
seasonal
beer
generally
well
put
together
and
worth
a
try
drinkability
pretty
good
but
sort
of
flat
in
flavor
and
complexity
bitterness
is
awkward
and
unpleasant
pass
on
this
one
if
something
better
is
available
overall
drinkable
strong
ale
but
not
exciting
at
the
price
id
recommend
giving
it
a
pass
and
selecting
something
else
drinkability
too
clove
and
piney
for
my
liking
but
a
fellow
taster
thought
it
was
divine
so
i
guess
i
have
to
give
it
average
drinkability
poured
from
the
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
very
thick
head
of
foam
that
held
form
for
about
20
minutes
and
turned
into
a
creamy
lace
dark
reddish
color
with
enough
carbonation
the
taste
of
christmas
spices
really
stand
out
throughout
the
whole
glass
it
appears
to
be
some
nutmeg
cinnomon
and
something
else
that
i
can
not
put
my
finger
on
pretty
good
overall
for
about
2
dollars
a
bottle
it
was
well
worth
it
550ml
brown
bottle
from
a1
togo
in
gardiner
pours
a
hazy
redamber
translucent
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
light
tan
head
smells
like
cinnamon
apple
pear
and
banana
tastes
fruity
with
caramel
and
cinnamon
playing
large
roles
a
rather
thin
aqueous
body
with
less
carbonation
than
expected
but
otherwise
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
definitely
not
the
best
winter
warmer
out
there
but
a
decent
drinker
and
a
fairly
solid
beer
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
amber
color
ale
with
a
good
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
very
good
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
cinnamon
are
very
well
balanced
taste
is
again
very
well
balanced
between
caramel
malt
and
cinnamon
with
some
notes
of
banana
and
cloves
also
discernable
body
is
very
creamylike
with
some
great
carbonation
and
a
medium
full
body
i
thought
the
mix
between
the
malt
and
the
cinnamon
was
very
well
done
in
this
one
taste
is
fairly
nutty
the
caramel
and
malt
take
the
forefront
though
and
the
followup
is
rather
spicy
with
hints
of
hops
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
drinkability
the
off
flavors
here
just
make
this
one
disappointing
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
reddishbrown
mahogany
in
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
somewhat
dense
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
little
lacing
smell
is
strongly
malty
namely
caramel
malts
a
bit
spicy
a
bit
fruity
figs
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
mostly
malty
and
a
bit
spicy
with
some
figs
and
dark
fruits
but
then
gives
way
to
a
pleasant
hop
presence
just
before
the
finish
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
a
somewhat
faded
spiciness
that
far
outlasts
the
hops
as
this
beer
warms
and
as
i
drink
more
of
i
find
a
rather
pleasant
aftertaste
that
i
can
only
describe
as
figlike
mouthfeel
is
ok
mediumlight
body
that
is
somewhat
slick
and
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
all
that
much
at
first
but
as
this
warmed
a
bit
i
really
began
to
like
this
beer
the
fruity
characteristics
of
this
beer
really
emerged
as
it
warmed
i
recommend
drinking
this
one
at
cellar
temp
not
my
favorite
christmas
ale
by
a
long
shot
but
not
bad
either
the
beer
pours
a
clear
nut
brown
color
with
some
tannish
head
that
dissipates
quickly
some
lacing
moderate
carbonation
the
smell
is
a
bit
musty
caramel
malty
candied
liquorice
the
consistency
is
surprisingly
thin
for
a
xmas
ale
in
fact
this
is
more
like
a
nut
brown
ale
with
a
dash
more
caramel
but
not
what
i
would
consider
a
xmas
ale
given
its
thinness
and
lack
of
real
spiciness
the
taste
as
mentioned
is
british
style
nut
brown
with
a
slight
twist
youll
get
a
combination
of
dryness
malty
caramel
some
spicy
tang
and
nut
flavors
on
the
front
end
towards
the
finish
the
nut
flavors
round
out
even
more
and
this
is
where
the
nut
brown
backbone
to
this
beer
comes
through
there
is
a
little
bit
more
sweetish
malts
that
emerge
in
the
middle
towards
the
finish
as
well
the
beer
is
rather
thin
with
a
light
to
medium
consistency
and
easily
drinkable
its
okay
not
bad
but
nothing
i
would
return
to
i
didnt
realize
that
this
brewery
also
makes
hobgoblin
which
is
a
much
better
offering
if
youre
sold
on
this
brew
house
d
i
had
a
difficult
time
with
this
one
as
it
wasnt
anything
special
to
me
just
another
english
ale
this
is
a
onetime
try
for
me
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
and
i
will
recommend
this
to
anyone
notes
unexceptional
but
solid
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
overall
a
good
brew
pitty
its
only
seasonal
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
big
rocky
tan
head
that
quickly
fell
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
has
strong
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
malty
and
full
of
caramelbelgian
candy
flavors
the
hops
are
subtle
in
the
background

this
is
a
malty
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
and
works
well
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
this
surprised
by
another
christmas
ale

but
i
am
d
the
bah
humbug
is
a
little
thin
in
my
opinion
but
still
good
what
it
lacks
in
body
is
made
up
for
in
how
smooth
it
is
very
nice
winter
warmer
beer
it
has
lots
of
good
flavors
and
a
hefty
body
but
at
6
not
so
strong
as
to
be
a
knockout
pours
dark
amber
slightly
hazy
and
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
very
fast
aroma
is
higher
alcohols
up
front
crystal
malts
and
some
earthy
hops
with
a
faintly
yeasty
background
flavor
is
very
estery
with
obvious
alcohol
notes
and
very
nice
crystal
malt
character
finish
is
malty
with
lots
of
butterscotch
and
alcoholic
notes
just
wanna
say
all
the
wychwood
beers
come
in
really
nice
bottles
with
great
artwork
i
think
this
one
is
there
best
one
yet
though
its
nothing
like
all
the
other
christmas
ales
ive
been
trying
it
pours
nice
color
good
aroma
the
thing
that
stands
out
on
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
it
really
tingles
on
the
tongue
i
know
its
a
seasonal
but
i
think
this
could
be
a
good
all
year
beer
like
i
said
its
not
really
in
the
christmas
ale
category
but
since
i
dont
live
in
england
it
is
rather
expensive
if
you
were
to
session
it
as
i
have
already
indicated
a
fine
beer
pity
the
head
did
a
runner
early
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
have
it
is
wellbalanced
and
without
any
flaws
i
imagine
if
i
were
to
have
this
in
an
english
pub
drawn
from
the
cellar
it
would
be
spectacular
wychwood
bah
humbug
christmas
ale
pours
a
clear
deep
red
with
a
thin
but
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
rich
caramel
and
dark
fruits
very
sweet
with
some
hints
of
metallic
hops
the
flavor
is
nice
and
flavorful
but
seems
to
be
lacking
something
from
the
aroma
the
dark
carmel
malts
are
there
and
there
is
a
nice
rounded
bitterness
but
the
beer
seems
thin
overall
theres
some
diacetyl
in
the
background
but
not
too
much
to
be
unpleasant
pours
an
inviting
darkbrown
toffee
color
out
of
a
tall
bottle
smell
is
wonderful
full
of
spices
cinnamon
toffee
and
vanilla
such
an
explosion
of
flavors
in
the
aroma
high
hopes
for
the
taste
which
doesnt
dissapoint
much
different
than
some
other
winter
warmers
ive
sampled
this
one
is
easily
the
best
one
ive
had
so
far
the
cinnamon
and
vanillaspice
flavor
is
so
rich
this
is
an
awesome
brew
definitely
worth
the
4
00
for
the
16
9
oz
bottle
too
bad
i
cant
find
it
in
a
sixpack
doesnt
have
that
oily
flavor
that
some
other
winter
warmers
have
which
i
really
appreciate
mouthfeel
is
great
but
with
such
an
explosion
of
flavors
i
wouldnt
want
to
down
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
single
setting
although
i
love
the
spicey
graham
cracker
taste
superb
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
and
certainly
recommended
overall
the
sweetness
is
respectable
and
the
bitterness
is
there
it
just
seems
unbalanced
to
me
but
nevertheless
its
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
and
hands
down
the
best
offering
from
an
average
brewer
worth
a
try
around
christmas
for
sure
this
ale
is
a
beautiful
coppery
amber
generates
a
decent
head
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
nice
nip
to
it
and
a
hint
of
spice
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
spicy
subtones
and
just
a
whisper
of
molasses
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
pleasantly
there
is
no
thinness
in
the
taste
or
texture
this
is
a
rich
winter
ale
besides
you
have
to
love
the
name
softened
notes
of
gingerbread
cinnamon
and
banana
make
for
a
darn
fine
winter
warmer
in
my
books
i
approached
this
beer
with
a
great
deal
of
skepticism
given
wychwoods
inconsistencies
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
ill
revisit
again
during
these
holidays
served
from
a
bottle
this
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
the
taste
is
sweet
with
cherry
and
plum
flavors
predominating
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
i
dont
detect
much
hop
presence
as
seems
typical
with
winter
warmers
the
flavors
blend
together
smoothly
and
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
satisfying
this
is
a
nice
solid
english
christmas
ale
now
if
only
i
could
get
it
on
draft
or
on
cask
as
already
mentioned
this
is
a
nice
creamy
beer
surprising
for
the
appearance
to
me
good
ale
carbonation
no
complaints
there
great
winter
beer
all
around
love
it
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
wychwood
ill
have
to
stock
up
also
it
came
in
a
brown
bottle
instead
of
clear
is
this
a
new
trend
or
just
specific
for
this
brew
colours
sort
of
a
light
almost
murky
brown
very
little
head
to
speak
of
just
a
light
perhaps
14
finger
of
foam
was
the
best
i
could
get
smell
was
delightful
that
almost
signature
british
ale
smell
sweet
malts
caramel
and
toffee
bit
of
figs
and
some
light
cinnamon
somewhat
floral
and
earthy
hops
with
the
emphasis
slighty
towards
floral
very
balanced
flavour
the
sweet
and
bitterness
intermingle
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
caramel
and
fig
sweetness
counterbalanced
by
a
grassy
earthy
bitterness
the
two
never
overpower
one
another
and
for
the
finish
a
spicy
cinnamon
bite
quite
a
nice
flavour
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
its
by
no
means
watery
but
its
light
very
little
carbonation
that
seems
to
give
it
almost
a
creamy
milky
feel
the
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
drinkability
very
good
beer
with
enough
flavour
to
keep
your
tongue
satisfied
but
not
so
much
that
it
overwhelms
the
senses
too
strong
for
a
session
brew
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
something
to
be
savored
in
front
of
a
fire
i
have
tasted
quite
a
few
winter
beers
and
this
is
currently
my
favorite
another
decent
offering
from
wychwood
this
was
neither
exceptional
nor
a
displeasing
poured
a
lovely
orange
spice
colour
with
a
big
fluffy
craggy
white
head
smell
was
almost
entirely
malt
with
a
bit
of
fruit
hiding
in
the
back
taste
was
bitter
hops
up
front
sweet
malt
in
the
middle
and
a
biscuity
malty
finish
mouthfeel
seemed
par
for
the
course
for
both
the
brewery
and
the
style
again
this
neither
impressed
me
nor
did
i
dislike
it
good
opinion
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
i
have
to
admit
early
on
that
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
british
bitters
for
the
most
part
this
is
labeled
as
a
winter
warmer
but
it
isnt
as
rich
as
a
lot
of
them
are
this
beer
is
on
the
boundary
between
an
esb
and
an
old
ale
and
closer
to
the
former
it
is
an
allright
beer
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
not
for
its
own
beer
but
because
its
not
my
style
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
aroma
is
mostly
malt
and
spice
and
it
also
smells
somewhat
sweet
taste
is
malty
upfront
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
sweet
with
some
spice
chewy
and
im
able
to
detect
somewhat
of
a
gingerbread
vibe
to
this
a
second
sip
confirms
the
spice
this
beer
is
very
bready
and
thick
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
but
other
than
that
this
beer
is
nice
and
drinkable
inoffensive
and
it
doesnt
ramp
up
the
spices
like
most
winter
warmers
a
christmas
ale
bah
humbug
this
tastes
like
cough
syrup
i
think
its
supposed
to
taste
like
liquefied
christmas
cake
if
that
is
true
then
it
is
a
raging
success
its
alright
i
dont
hate
it
its
a
novelty
beer
the
label
said
it
had
cinnamon
in
it
but
that
particular
spice
doesnt
come
through
enough
for
my
liking
maybe
this
would
taste
good
mulled
i
bet
it
would
mulling
sampling
this
one
for
work
were
bringing
this
one
in
for
the
holiday
season
the
appearance
is
a
copperyreddish
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
which
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
a
mostly
sweet
smell
not
much
else
to
it
i
taste
mostly
sweetness
caramel
and
not
much
hops
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
not
bad
its
an
above
average
beer
with
a
nice
malty
taste
the
heaviness
is
something
nice
for
winter
overall
this
would
have
to
get
a
decent
from
me
nothing
really
spectacular
going
on
here
and
just
nothing
really
overwhelming
me
to
say
anything
different
i
really
could
not
see
myself
having
this
during
the
winter
season
as
it
is
just
too
light
nothing
that
grabs
you
and
says
warm
about
it
it
was
just
a
spiced
up
brown
ale
for
me
and
that
was
about
it
i
am
not
bashing
it
as
it
was
quite
tasty
actually
just
nothing
mind
blowing
here
for
session
ale
ok
with
a
hint
of
something
a
little
more
aftertaste
hangs
around
a
good
while
medium
body
at
best
light
efferevescence
all
told
a
middle
of
the
road
english
ale
across
the
board
easy
ot
drink
but
nothing
to
really
separate
it
from
any
other
brown
ale
overall
an
enjoyable
yet
unusual
beer
if
you
like
winter
beers
its
certainly
worthy
of
a
try
personally
while
i
found
it
rather
interesting
its
not
so
much
my
thing
and
ill
probably
pass
in
the
future
when
cold
this
beer
is
overwhelming
burntbitter
but
once
cooled
down
in
the
english
style
even
the
queen
would
be
amused
it
was
extremely
wellrounded
and
pleasant
above
average
merry
christmas
in
april
ok
so
its
march
madness
what
better
time
for
a
christmas
beer
this
poured
a
nice
big
duddy
rusty
orange
with
a
solid
cloud
cover
of
offwhite
foam
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
sweet
and
tart
like
a
freshly
picked
orange
dripping
all
over
your
hand
the
first
sip
is
also
sweeter
than
id
expected
more
orange
peel
than
the
advertised
cinammon
theres
a
milkiness
here
too
though
that
settles
into
a
banana
smoothie
essence
as
it
warms
the
more
i
go
the
more
of
a
banana
cream
pie
i
think
im
consuming
a
150degree
change
from
the
tease
of
the
first
aroma
and
contrary
altogether
from
the
dark
visual
this
is
a
big
creamy
and
fruity
beer
for
the
style
definitely
drinkable

drinkability
not
great
not
bad
drinkability
on
the
one
hand
its
light
and
approachable
so
thats
good
but
theres
nothing
memorable
here
for
the
style
the
belly
should
be
slightly
warm
and
the
senses
titillated
with
holiday
spices
this
falls
a
bit
flat
other
comments
not
too
bad
its
actually
one
of
the
more
christmasy
christmas
special
ales
ive
tried
rather
than
the
usual
english
winter
warmer
comprised
of
a
brewerys
standard
bitter
with
an
extra
pound
of
malt
and
hops
added
the
cinnamon
adds
an
interesting
backnote
and
warmth
overall
a
good
ale
id
probably
rate
it
higher
but
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
poured

reddish

i
would
suggest
trying
it
out
on
a
cold
night
while
not
the
most
interesting
christmas
ale
ive
had
it
is
definitely
a
decent
one
if
you
give
it
a

mouthfeel
id
use
this
beer
along
with
the

as

not

to
sound

but
did
i
mention
rich
would
i
buy
it
again
no
i
just
do
not
care
for
those
types
of
flavours
this
one
sloshed
out
of
the
bottle
virtually
no
carbonation
other
than
some
offwhite
bubbles
around
the
edges
undated
bottle
so
perhaps
an
old
one
it
has
the
color
of
iced
tea
smells
like
cocacola
sweet
some
ripened
fruit
raisins
vanilla
the
taste
is
a
real
letdown
sweet
a
bit
malty
some
more
vanilla
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
it
tastes
like
flat
coke
mixed
with
some
orange
soda
im
willing
to
try
it
again
as
this
may
be
an
old
bottle
truly
a
let
down
after
seeing
the
high
reviews
on
ba
i
had
very
high
expectations
for
this
brew
it
poured
with
little
to
no
head
maybe
due
to
a
bad
pour
and
the
color
was
fine
but
nothing
particularly
appealing
i
drank
this
out
of
a
perfect
pint
glass
but
didnt
really
experience
much
nose
on
the
beer
after
pouring
related
to
my
imperfect
pour
perhaps
but
the
taste
was
the
biggest
disappointment
i
can
only
compare
it
to
flat
soda
sweet
with
little
carbonation
and
just
a
mediocre
sugary
taste
couldnt
even
finish
it
overall
though
i
bought
this
bottle
the
other
day
i
have
no
idea
how
old
it
was
given
the
price
markdown
i
am
sure
it
was
not
this
years
edition
and
it
may
not
have
been
last
years
either
as
i
look
through
the
previous
reviews
there
is
a
distinct
downward
trend
and
reduced
number
of
reviews
over
the
last
few
years
so
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
this
beer
hasnt
been
imported
for
a
while
trying
to
account
for
all
this
i
find
that
there
are
some
pleasing
aspects
to
the
beer
but
the
soy
sauce
in
particular
really
detracts
from
the
overall
enjoyment
this
is
a
winter
warmer
that
is
very
malty
fruity
and
pretty
sweet
but
not
very
spicy
it
is
just
ok
and
lacks
complexity
it
doesnt
hold
my
interest
and
i
would
not
have
another
glass
of
this

but
nothing
to
bring
me
back
next

kind
of
wanted
to
like
this
a
bit
more
no
date
on
the
bottle
from
the
source
it
could
have
been
an
older
bottle
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
compared
to
others
in
the
style
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
it
almost
seems
to
taste
more
like
port
wine
instead
of
beer
this
beer
is
flatter
than
normal
a
stillish
amber
liquid
with
a
nearly
nonexistent
head
a
ring
of
white
suds
the
aroma
is
all
fruit
and
malt
cherry
gristmill
apricot
grapeskin
and
lightly
toasted
bread
the
flavor
is
now
what
was
expected
intense
sweetness
to
begin
with
nearly
sugary
followed
with
a
bit
of
booze
and
enough
balance
to
even
things
out
some
gristy
malty
characteristics
english
hops
this
is
a
traditional
strong
english
ale
all
the
way
over
the
top
really
full
body
to
be
enjoyed
in
sips
not
a
gulps
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
expected
o
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
but
not
one
i
would
go
back
to
i
like
this
beer
its
not
through
the
roof
but
it
is
a
good
and
complex
beer
with
some
really
enjoyable
fruit
flavors
odont
care
for
it
i
feel
bad
but
i
really
didnt
like
this
brew
at
all
it
was
very
flat
and
some
of
the
flavors
were
not
agreeing
with
my
taste
buds
perhaps
it
was
an
old
bottle
and
it
lost
some
of
its
kick
over
time
the
beer
has
a
nice
appearance
but
thats
about
all
i
could
see
as
a
plus
for
this
brew
extraordinarily
sweet
brown
sugar
maltiness
cloyingly
overpoweringly
sweetness
please
some
hops
anywhere
please
uh
no
cant
find
em
mouthfeel
is
also
miserably
less
than
substantial
dark
fruity
maple
syrup
is
the
only
way
to
describe
this
wow
avoid
miserable
beer
tastes
like
sweet
mead
with
added
brown
sugar
thus
is
not
beer
period
gross
wow
pass
not
recommended
might
i
also
add
that
im
thrilled
to
be
finished
with
my
holiday
catchup
now
on
to
one
last
pumpkin
ale
then
back
to
the
ipas
this
beer
pours
a
burnt
dark
brown
with
amber
accents
it
has
virtually
no
head
but
some
light
foam
does
lace
the
glass
this
beer
smells
exactly
like
spicy
raisins
its
strange
and
is
a
total
malt
bomb
it
tastes
like
melted
brown
sugar
mixed
with
raisins
and
figs
it
is
syrupy
sweet
it
drinks
smoothly
but
its
way
too
sweet
this
beer
is
near
undrinkable
not
quality
whatsoever
d
its
a
warming
brew
it
doesnt
lie
the
flavour
is
nice
not
great
there
are
better
english
beers
for
the
price
a
english
malt
bomb
with
a
subtle
bitter
kicker
to
its
otherwise
arrange
of
malts
pour
is
rich
amber
with
a
yellowish
off
white
head
nose
is
caramel
and
toffee
toasted
malt
palate
is
that
sort
of
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
mild
citrus
note
toffee
toasted
and
burnt
a
bit
of
a
pineapple
candied
sweet
persimmon
and
a
assam
tea
bitter
at
the
end
that
gives
it
a
much
drier
note
than
expected
although
i
must
say
that
the
abv
is
evident
definitely
made
the
bitter
burnt
quality
more
prevalent
but
still
quite
nice
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
d
pretty
good
definitely
a
dipper
id
rather
have
this
one
over
many
other
christmas
ales
as
a
winter
warmer
it
definitely
warms
your
throat
i
would
buy
this
again
4

d
an
interesting
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
begs
to
be
enjoyed
in
front
of
a
fireplace
d
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
undetectable
on
the
nose
and
palate
i
could
make
a
night
out
of
this
quite
easily
especially
in
the
colder
months
poured
a
claer
brown
with
ruby
tints
that
gave
a
good
head
and
lace
on
top
of
a
sweet
smell
with
some
spiciness
and
minor
hop
bitterness
really
sweet
and
mellow
medium
body
beer
passes
easily
while
giving
off
caramel
cinnamon
bread
minor
hops
and
other
sugary
sweetness
but
all
so
subtle
abv
complements
beer
with
warming
sensation
on
backend
and
this
one
is
real
enjoyable
to
drink
a
nice
sipper
not
too
rich
and
respectively
not
too
sweet
pretty
good
beer
poured
a
medium
brown
with
little
head
smells
of
christmas
spices
taste
like
prunes
with
some
nutmegs
spicing
high
alcohol
content
gives
this
a
warm
but
sharp
after
taste
that
some
may
not
like
i
usually
do
not
like
high
alcohol
beer
but
this
one
was
ok
not
bad
just
not
great
definately
a
winter
warmer
because
you
feel
the
alcohol
warm
you
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yeah
maybe
not
totally
sure
there
are
way
too
many
other
beers
out
there
that
id
love
to
try
before
i
go
back
to
this
one
it
would
make
a
nice
gift
for
any
beer
lover
on
your
christmas
list
the
body
is
between
moderate
and
full
but
a
very
light
carbonation
that
could
benefit
from
a
bit
more
carbonic
bite
a
bit
too
sweet
as
well
would
like
to
see
a
bit
smoother
noticeable
alcohol
that
is
bit
off
overall
a
good
beer
but
would
benefit
with
age
for
sure
d
again
very
smooth
and
drinkable
if
it
was
a
little
boozier
i
might
knock
it
down
a
notch
but
this
is
pretty
well
balanced
overall
a
very
nice
offering
as
a
winter
warmer
but
i
would
almost
call
this
a
barleywine
still
pretty
delicious
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
low
carbonation
very
smooth
trying
very
hard
to
savor
this
beer
and
not
chug
it
purchased
this
one
at
derks
fillet
and
vine
in
montgomery
alabama
harveys
christmas
ale
doesnt
make
much
head
when
it
is
poured
but
it
looks
nice
in
my
glass
its
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
earthy
it
tastes
sweet
with
just
a
little
alcohol
burn
the
alcohol
is
hidden
here
in
my
opinion
i
detect
sweet
fruit
with
a
truckload
of
malt
i
find
this
beer
pretty
tasty
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
nice
maybe
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
ive
tried
so
far
at
4
75
this
seems
a
little
overpriced
to
me
quite
mellow
and
english
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
just
a
bit
sparkling
lovely
beer
because
of
the
lack
of
body
this
one
scores
low
on
drinkability
it
has
decent
flavor
but
the
thin
nature
of
it
makes
it
so
much
less
enjoyable
than
it
could
be
tastes
strong
upfront
weak
in
the
back
hurt
pretty
badly
by
a
weak
body
big
wood
strong
malt
and
for
the
advanced
alcohol
level
it
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
not
getting
too
sweet
or
burny
but
like
i
said
the
lack
of
balance
between
the
front
and
back
really
hurts
it
solid
little
beer
and
my
only
real
complaint
was
the
bottle
was
a
little
small
as
this
one
really
was
solid
as
hell
had
this
on
cask
at
the
brick
store
pub
poured
a
dark
chestnut
with
some
oloroso
sherry
highlights
and
a
thin
grainy
head
smells
slightly
sour
and
woody
to
start
followed
by
some
stewed
fruit
and
light
malt
clearly
not
in
tiptop
shape
after
its
voyage
but
still
pretty
tasty
tastes
very
fruity
with
a
sherry
like
component
that
makes
itself
known
now
and
again
spicy
and
malty
as
well
and
altogether
rich
and
fruitcakelike
very
smooth
and
pleasant
to
drink
a
nice
winter
treat
many
thanks
to
the
brick
store
for
going
through
the
effort
to
put
this
on
i
expected
this
to
be
a
sipper
drinks
very
easily
despite
sweetness
and
8
abv
warming
but
not
hot
or
sharp
complex
but
approachable
and
very
drinkable
abv
there
but
mellow
big
but
soft
a
tasty
winter
brew
that
fits
the
winter
season
very
well
a
malty
delight
md
interestingly
the
bottle
be
it
filtered
or
pasteurised
or
both
keeps
the
most
soft
yet
simultaneously
fresh
palate
for
a
strong
ale
at
8
1abv
showing
not
a
wee
bit
of
syrupy
but
only
most
soothing
lubricating
mouthfeel
throughout
the
drink
the
bottle
version
is
so
different
from
the
cask
one
as
far
as
this
years
version
is
concerned
its
less
sweet
cleaner
more
hoppy
and
more
bitter
and
in
every
way
just
as
enjoyable
in
a
totally
different
way
md
the
caskness
of
this
means
theres
very
little
carbonation
but
the
spiciness
and
malty
sweetness
means
it
dances
over
the
tongue
this
is
a
very
drinkable
excellent
brew
that
exemplifies
its
style
but
is
also
drinkable
yearround
wonderful
brit
brew
the
beer
poured
an
opaque
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
and
spice
the
taste
started
out
very
sweet
with
just
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
but
as
it
warmed
the
sweetness
dropped
and
the
spices
gained
the
feel
was
heavy
and
wet
even
though
it
was
on
cask
so
it
came
out
fairly
warm
it
still
improved
greatly
as
the
temperature
improved
in
the
end
it
was
a
very
decent
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
really
unique
winter
warmer
especially
for
the
uk
it
is
decidedly
british
much
more
akin
to
an
barleywine
then
i
was
expecting
which
is
great
still
its
a
pretty
slow
sipper
and
not
something
youll
session
with
decent
drinkability
is
better
than
the
abv
would
lead
you
to
believe
very
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
good
stuff
here
i
havent
had
this
in
a
bottle
so
i
dont
have
a
direct
comparison
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
on
cask
dport
like
in
its
brilliance
a
well
fortified
brew
of
body
malt
goodness
and
flavour
complexity
this
one
is
so
much
like
a
liquid
fruit
compote
its
crazy
so
luscious
and
delicious
a
winner
every
year
a
sippable
beer
the
abv
seems
greater
than
it
actually
is
but
still
enjoyable
pours
a
brillant
clear
reddish
brown
color
no
head
minimal
co2
and
poor
lacing
aroma
was
a
pleasently
sweet
malt
aroma
no
hops
but
i
didnt
expect
any
being
it
is
a
british
beer
the
flavor
was
better
than
i
expected
starts
out
malty
and
toasty
like
aroma
and
leaves
you
with
nothing
better
than
most
british
beers
but
that
isnt
saying
much
pours
a
deep
amber
to
a
brownish
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
in
the
roma
mainly
licorice
and
small
hints
of
dark
fruit
plums
and
figs
in
the
taste
licorice
dark
fruits
figs
primarily
and
just
a
touch
watery
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
licorice
aftertaste
nice
flavor
although
a
bit
watery
it
was
great
but
thinner
than
expected
the
taste
was
definitely
a
malt
lovers
dream
with
sweetness
filling
the
palate
with
that
dark
raisin
taste
you
got
a
slight
hop
presence
on
the
finish
but
not
much
in
the
smell
it
was
pretty
viscous
on
the
tongue
and
left
the
slick
at
the
back
of
the
throat
definitely
old
school
winter
warmer
style
enjoyable
warmer
but
i
seem
to
enjoy
the
ones
with
a
stronger
hop
profile
but
this
was
worth
the
money
the
abv
was
pretty
aggressive
but
not
too
much
over
the
top
pours
a
dark
plum
color
with
barely
any
head
aroma
of
black
cherries
and
other
dark
fruits
such
as
plum
and
raisin
also
hints
of
cinnamon
spice
and
alcohol
very
smooth
tasting
with
a
nice
fruit
fig
raisin
plum
alcohol
and
hop
balance
not
a
gulper
but
a
sipper
smooth
like
a
red
ale
but
with
the
winter
flavors
as
an
added
bonus
nothing
really
special
with
this
beer
if
you
are
a
fig
fanatic
you
probably
would
love
this
beer
high
abv
lowers
the
drinkability
drinks
okay
i
could
do
a
pint
or
2
before
moving
on
solid
winter
warmer
that
im
sure
would
be
stellar
on
cask
dark
red
burgundy
cloudy
and
dense
topped
by
a
modest
bubbly
head
aroma
is
tart
and
sweet
with
green
grapes
orange
peel
lemon
peel
purple
grapes
plumbs
chocolate
pipe
smoke
molasses
toffee
and
probably
a
whole
bunch
of
other
stuff
the
smell
goes
on
forever
until
the
next
beer
taste
is
similar
in
length
nice
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
dry
fruitiness
body
is
full
feeling
but
still
like
an
ale
nice
mellow
carbonation
easy
to
drink
at
an
enjoyable
pace
a
dark
clear
brown
with
a
small
amount
of
off
white
foam
the
smell
is
sweet
burnt
sugar
ripe
dark
fruit
raisins
perhaps
with
some
autumn
spiciness
and
alcohol
esters
the
beer
is
sweet
and
sugary
the
sweetness
is
slightly
offset
by
some
mild
earthy
hops
but
the
sweet
dark
fruit
flavors
and
sugary
malt
character
is
dominant
the
finish
is
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
the
feel
in
the
mouth
is
medium
bodied
and
has
an
almost
oily
smoothness
about
it
this
is
an
elixir
to
be
sure
d
overall
a
nice
dark
festive
drink
with
a
spicy
black
licorice
flavor
makes
this
a
standout
amongst
other
xmas
beers
and
very
enjoyable
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
hardly
any
head
more
of
a
fine
sheet
and
creamy
bubbly
ring
some
minor
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
heavy
rich
malts
apples
brown
sugar
toffee
and
sweet
bread
raisin
and
black
tea
flavors
lots
of
raisins
actually
rich
malts
and
dark
sugary
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
coating
this
is
a
nice
festive
english
strong
ale
of
sorts
no
heat
from
the
alcohol
at
all
just
a
rich
flavorful
beer
im
glad
i
stumbled
onto
this
beer
it
was
quite
enjoyable
minimal
carbonation
and
smooth
figured
it
would
be
sticky
with
this
much
sweetness
but
it
is
quite
enjoyable
body
is
pretty
full
otherwise
and
quite
enjoyable
couldnt
tell
you
how
much
i
paid
for
this
but
ive
noticed
it
showed
up
in
kansas
in
the
past
several
months
so
it
looks
like
i
can
replenish
my
supply
bottle
from
johns
grocery
in
iowa
city
pours
brown
with
no
head
but
lots
of
bubbles
lacing
slow
and
fracticious
smells
of
toasted
caramel
figs
hints
of
cherries
brandy
malt
syrup
flavor
is
rather
reserved
for
what
i
was
expecting
toffee
with
chocolate
notes
giving
way
to
a
sweet
bitterness
vegetal
and
lemony
spiced
flavors
of
anise
and
nuts
bitterness
slightly
over
the
top
mouthfeel
a
bit
sticky
medium
bodied
overall
its
good
but
im
a
little
overwhelmed
still
its
well
made
and
interesting
md
solid
medium
body
kind
of
slick
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
pretty
good
on
this
one
as
nothing
is
really
wrong
with
it
just
no
totally
redeeming
qualities
although
the
sourness
in
the
nose
was
a
surprise
in
the
world
of
winter
warmers
this
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
single
bottle
from
whole
food
raleigh
this
overall
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
after
dinner
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
this
beer
i
had
heard
about
this
beer
for
years
and
finally
got
a
chance
to
have
it
sweet
in
taste
high
abv
but
still
very
drinkable
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
a
sticky
i
guess
that
is
the
best
way
to
say
it
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
def
drink
it
again
would
recommend
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
poured
bigorously
but
i
only
get
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
head
that
quickly
turns
into
just
a
skim
after
a
few
seconds
body
is
a
deep
brownish
red
with
a
ruby
shine
in
the
light
nose
is
super
sweet
with
cordial
cherry
port
and
waxy
chocolate
notes
zesty
sweetness
jumps
at
the
senses
with
first
sip
a
distinct
malty
feel
overall
inculding
a
burnt
malt
mouthfeel
on
the
finish
slightly
soured
feel
also
rounds
out
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
bice
belly
warmer
for
8
alchol
rich
and
a
joy
to
drink
this
holiday
season
reviewed
on
122606
not
exactly
the
ideal
beer
for
a
hot
day
like
today
but
what
the
hell
i
wanted
to
try
something
a
little
out
there
it
poured
into
a
erdinger
weizen
glass
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
slightly
tanned
head
that
had
impressive
retention
in
the
aroma
was
baked
bread
ginger
chocolate
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
wow
this
beer
is
much
more
complicated
than
i
had
originally
thought
taste
had
lots
of
dark
fruit
cocoa
raisins
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
molasses
it
had
a
certain
red
wine
character
to
it
as
well
mouthfeel
was
slick
and
creamy
without
much
hop
presence
one
bottle
of
this
is
damn
easy
to
drink
though
more
than
one
and
the
alcohol
would
be
hitting
me
for
sure
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
it
would
go
well
with
lots
of
different
red
meats
i
bet
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
these
around
christmas
time
cheers
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
applecider
color
with
a
thin
frothy
white
head
smell
is
sweet
like
fruit
dates
and
grapes
with
a
whiff
of
alcohol
taste
is
very
much
like
the
smell
with
the
fruitiness
coming
out
but
is
well
balanced
by
the
warming
alcohol
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
slightly
creamy
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
although
it
isnt
spiced
like
most
of
the
winter
warmers
ive
had
i
can
still
see
this
being
a
good
choice
for
a
cold
winter
night
enjoyable
and
smooth
mouthfeelsweet
mellow
english
barleywine
taste
this
aged
well
and
the
hops
have
diminished
to
an
almost
nonexistant
state
alcohol
is
faint
and
this
ale
stays
sweet
to
the
finish
very
tasty
and
i
would
like
to
taste
a
fresh
one
sometime
it
was
very
good
as
an
after
dinner
beverage
also
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
chilled
it
pours
a
dark
amber
to
chestnut
color
with
a
thin
creamcolored
surface
layer
nothing
real
exciting
here
aroma
is
first
of
some
oak
wood
as
though
it
is
barrelaged
which
i
dont
think
it
is
upon
a
second
sniff
i
notice
a
fruity
nose
of
berries
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
malts
very
sweet
on
the
nose
really
no
hops
detected
sweet
to
tart
plums
and
berries
to
which
much
of
the
entire
sip
is
engulfed
in
the
fruit
nothing
but
fruit
really
until
the
swallow
to
which
soem
alcohol
and
drying
come
through
not
much
carbonation
at
all
but
most
is
wrapped
up
in
the
alcohol
of
it
its
a
tasty
brew
but
judging
by
previous
reviews
its
identity
seems
to
be
a
bit
lost
in
teh
fact
that
most
warmers
ive
had
contain
some
sort
of
spice
to
which
this
one
doesnt
have
except
maybe
a
hint
of
coriander
ive
had
better
in
teh
style
however
it
is
tasty
and
im
sure
ill
enjoy
the
8
note
upon
completion
of
this
beer
and
review
i
looked
at
the
price
tag
and
the
date
was
marked
112303
this
would
make
it
three
years
old
presuming
the
datestamp
was
correct
which
it
might
not
have
been
and
could
account
for
why
mine
was
so
flat
i
will
publish
this
anyway
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
little
to
no
head
there
seems
to
be
very
little
carbonation
as
well
but
there
is
a
strange
veillike
ring
of
bubbles
floating
on
top
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
large
and
dense
mostly
of
dark
malts
and
grains
but
a
bit
of
candided
fruits
as
well
many
more
flavors
than
i
would
expect
to
find
in
a
winter
warmer
the
most
striking
characteristic
about
this
beer
is
how
flat
it
is
there
is
no
carbonation
whatsoever
it
goes
down
almost
like
a
juice
with
lots
of
different
flavors
crowding
the
tongue
lots
of
dates
raisins
and
molasses
initially
goes
down
very
easy
because
of
this
and
it
would
not
be
hard
to
go
overboard
with
this
brew
terrific
for
a
winter
warmer
pours
clear
redbrown
without
head
or
lace
smells
sweet
and
toasted
full
of
raisins
spiced
cookie
dough
and
caramel
laced
with
alcohol
spice
the
taste
is
unexpected
to
say
the
least
starts
rounded
and
toasty
but
rapidly
turns
quite
bitter
and
unpleasant
mostly
an
herbal
sourness
that
develops
outofcontrol
diacetyl
and
phenols
in
the
finish
mediumsticky
body
with
surprisingly
lively
carbonation
for
the
age
perhaps
worthwhile
when
fresh
but
hard
to
tell
at
this
age
aroma
is
rich
with
brown
sugar
and
raisins
some
yeast
notes
create
some
dough
and
a
bit
of
fruit
i
also
get
some
hot
alcohol
whiffs
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
silky
texture
carbonationis
spacious
and
not
very
prevelant
flavor
is
mostly
sweet
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
mixing
with
a
bit
of
red
grape
as
well
i
get
some
peppery
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
beer
is
good
and
has
some
good
flavor
meshing
but
the
heat
on
the
finish
keeps
it
a
sipper
and
drops
the
drinkability
a
bit
although
i
find
it
suitable
for
the
style
not
an
intro
beer
for
sure
but
a
nice
brew
for
a
cold
nite
drinkability
i
regret
not
getting
to
this
one
sooner
and
will
surely
pick
up
a
few
more
definitely
my
fave
of
the
winter
warmer
league
overall
this
is
my
favorite
christmas
beer
yet
good
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
a
nice
bitter
roasty
malt
punch
at
the
end
overall
decent
but
there
are
better
winterchristmas
beers
out
there
if
you
like
the
taste
of
portbrandyscotch
you
might
want
to
give
this
one
a
try
d
quite
nice
and
rounded
with
pronounced
flavor
alcohol
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
what
so
ever
really
grows
on
me
after
a
while
its
too
bad
that
harveys
christmas
ale
doesnt
come
in
bigger
bottles
275
ml
isnt
nearly
enough
of
this
delicious
quintessentially
english
winter
warmer
drinking
it
makes
me
think
of
a
currier
ives
winter
landscape
a
true
classic
pours
a
cherrywood
color
with
lots
of
lighter
highlights
from
ruby
to
blonde
and
almost
inert
carbonation
with
no
head
typical
of
an
old
ale
which
this
beer
kind
of
is
crossed
with
a
winter
warmer
the
nose
is
very
complex
with
caramel
apples
being
the
biggest
element
but
it
also
features
some
spices
and
quince
the
taste
is
quite
nice
for
wintertime
sweet
caramel
first
off
with
tart
fruits
at
the
midpalate
and
spices
in
the
finish
smooth
with
a
touch
of
acidity
and
drying
hops
toward
the
finish
this
is
one
excellent
winter
beer
not
something
you
can
chug
but
definitely
something
to
be
savored
in
small
doses
on
a
cold
night
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
as
it
was
quite
pricey
for
a
small
bottle
well
its
a
disappointment
not
awful
but
unbalanced
and
sweet
i
finished
it
mostly
on
principle
overall
not
bad
but
there
are
cheaper
and
better
winter
warmers
on
this
side
of
the

this

has
been
on

for
a

maybe
somewhat
light
struck
with
some

a

of

of

raisins
are

seems
shallow

the

a
dark

color
with

an

i
do
not
know
how
old
this
sample
is
i
got
it
in
a
chrismas
basket
but
this
sample
at
least
is
a
very
complex
and
savory
old
ale
with
legs
enough
to
cellar
and
stand
up
to
the
best
of
the
old
ales
this
is
the
type
of
beer
to
share
with
close
friends
after
dinner
the
type
of
beer
that
you
finish
with
a
twinge
of
regret
as
you
wonder
how
well
it
would
have
aged
longer
this
is
one
to
look
out
for
if
you
find
it
get
it
and
lay
it
down

then
i
dont
taste
it
at
all
the
next
delicious
complex
flavors
mouthfeel
is
thick
almost
no
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
its
also
a
nice
one
to
age
i
had
a
several
year
old
bottle
once
and
it
was
amazing
drinkability
very
drinkable
which
begs
the
question
why
such
a
small
bottle
i
think
that
this
beer
has
potential
and
the
beerlike
flavors
that
came
through
could
have
been
enjoyable
however
i
couldnt
get
past
the
fact
that
it
tasted
like
i
was
sucking
on
a
quarter
a
fine
tasty
treat
leading
into
the
cold
season
from
the
nose
i
was
expecting
the
flavor
to
go
overboard
too
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
could
easily
enjoy
this
in
moderate
quantities
very
nice
a
bit
too
sharp
when
cold
drink
this
one
as
it
warms
to
5060f
i
remember
this
one
fondly
from
my
pre
ba
days
but
now
it
just
seems
average
there
are
much
better
choices
in
this
category
i
like
the
9oz
bottle
but
not
the
22oz
price
tag
smelled
a
burnt
spicey
and
dark
fruit
mixture
that
leaned
towards
the
burnt
smell
tasted
more
of
the
fruit
and
spiceyness
balance
than
anything
else
a
bit
sour
in
the
end
taste
i
may
have
tried
this
past
its
prime
i
found
the
warming
to
be
late
in
every
drink
but
pleasant
some
nice
features
and
one
that
id
consider
at
another
time
cheers

quite
superb

also
quite
rare
many
thanks

czar

for
sharing
this
thanks
to
rick
for
sharing
the

drinkability
quite
a
decent
winter
warmer
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
to
date
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
of
these
net
year
i
bit
steep
in
price
but
it
seems
that
its
worth
it
yum
very
tasty
brew
reminds
me
very
much
of
westvleteren
12
in
flavor
a
superior
brew
a
bit
esoteric
and
its
eccentricities
are
difficult
to
accept
up
front
but
by
the
finale
of
this
all
too
small
glass
im
willing
to
call
it
classic
a
very
nice
vintage
ale
soft
and
pleasant
this
is
a
nice
late
night
sipper
i
imagine
this
would
be
very
good
fresh
but
its
a
real
treat
with
a
bit
of
age
definitly
a
sipper
rich
with
a
heavy
feel
to
it
pours
a
reddish
color
and
has
little
to
no
head
not
very
impressed
with
the
appearance
the
smell
was
alright
it
smells
predominately
like
raisins
with
a
little
bit
of
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
it
is
malty
with
very
little
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
to
brag
about
but
it
suits
the
beer
i
guess
light
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
its
an
alright
beer
i
liked
it
but
i
think
a
lot
of
people
would
think
it
was
nothing
special
i
think
this
beer
would
be
better
by
simply
increasing
the
carbonation
i
have
had
2
of
these
and
both
were
lightly
carbonated
so
its
not
just
a
coincidence
i
would
recommend
it
poured
a
reddishbrown
color
with
slight
carbonation
level
while
there
was
basically
no
head
it
did
leave
some
nice
lacing
on
down
the
glass
low
in
aromasomewhat
winey
and
vinuous
port
like
big
upfront
flavor
of
malt
and
alcohol
raisenycaramelanise
underlying
sweetness
the
flavor
and
alcohol
seems
to
make
it
a
bigger
beer
then
it
actually
is
not
all
that
well
balanced
decent
bodysomewhat
viscous
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
theres
some
better
winter
warmers
out
there
id
try
first
this
one
is
trying
to
hard
and
it
doesnt
really
come
off
the
first
taste
is
hot
and
roasty
of
alcohol
and
malt
that
is
is
there
a
bit
of
diacetaly
and
soy
wow
this
is
weird
interesting
and
good
but
weird
the
vintage
is
unknown
but
id
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
this
wasnt
cellared
some
if
only
at
the
brewery
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
insubstantial
considering
how
big
the
beer
is
otherwise
indicating
some
cellaring
no
hopping
is
noticable
a
bit
sweet
certainly
roasty
and
alcoholic
theres
a
weird
sour
bit
at
the
end
certainly
an
interesting
experience
but
not
one
id
like
to
repeat
too
often
strange
beer
i
was
sitting
with
someone
who
went
wild
over
this
beer
so
i
guess
its
a
taste
that
i
just
dont
crave
simply
much
too
much
like
raw
molassas
couldnt
handle
it
maybe
id
enjoy
doing
shots
of
it
outside
on
a
snowy
day
who
knows
my
first
britishstyle
winter
warmer
id
like
to
try
another
bender
factor
2003
wasnt
as
good
as
2002
its
interesting
to
see
the
difference
a
year
makes
regardless
stellar
had
this
over
thanksgiving
a
bottle
david
had
purchased
last
year
vintage
who
knows
the
pormised
date
on
the
bottle
cap
was
mia
pour
in
the
pint
glass
hey
grandma
doesnt
have
all
those
fancy
glasses
was
a
dark
cola
color
with
a
low
head
aroma
was
of
burnt
sugar
followed
by
plums
and
raisins
full
mouthfeel
carbonation
still
looking
for
it
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
sort
of
coffee
meets
caramel
thing
going
on
david
and
i
shared
the
bottle
so
i
didnt
drink
it
all
by
myself
but
you
could
tell
there
was
alcohol
hanging
out
in
the
back
i
enjoyed
this
beer
probably
as
i
only
had
half
the
bottle
by
the
end
of
it
the
beer
had
me
thinking
toffifay
its
too
good
for
kids
im
probably
the
only
person
that
remembers
that
candy
tangysweet
fruit
flavors
up
front
tart
grapes
plums
and
raisins
licorice
flavor
develops
backed
by
musty
sweet
and
sour
malts
maybe
a
little
past
its
prime
still
interesting
and
slightly
drinkable
fullbodied
and
kind
of
syrupy
finish
is
anisey
and
warming
all
in
all
a
really
nice
beer
though
definitely
an
english
christmas
ale
and
thus
heavy
on
the
warmer
side
rather
than
on
the
spicy
side
good
stuff
very
well
crafted
and
a
near
perfect
winter
warmer
for
a
strong
old
ale
from
england
have
one
of
these
and
curl
up
in
front
of
the
fireplace
on
a
cold
winter
night
wish
i
had
bought
a
few
more
of
these
to
cellar
until
next
winter
the
2000
vintage
will
only
get
better
with
a
bit
of
age
i
am
unsure
of
the
vintage
of
this
bottle
its
great
stuff
regardless
though
cloudy
ruby
body
with
a
thin
dark
lace
on
top
complex
chocolate
malty
aroma
with
fruity
spicy
and
yeasty
notes
flavor
is
beautifully
complex
as
well
rich
coffee
notes
lead
the
way
to
toasty
malts
complemented
in
the
aftertaste
by
notes
of
fresh
mint
and
plum
skins
alcohol
is
mildly
noticeable
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
smooth
with
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
makes
me
think
this
bottle
has
been
aged
for
a
few
years
this
brew
far
exceeded
my
expectations
i
want
more
of
this
for
now
and
for
the
cellar
simply
an
excellent
ale
harveys
christmas
ale
whoa
virtually
no
head
to
speak
of
and
i
poured
the
crap
out
of
it
very
lightly
carbonated
the
beer
is
a
medium
brown
which
is
very
hazy
opaque
the
aroma
is
strong
alcoholic
with
dried
fruits
like
prunes
and
raisins
not
much
of
a
beer
but
not
that
bad
of
a
plum
wine
or
some
such
thing
alcohol
is
to
me
the
dominant
flavor
of
this
brew
tastes
are
raisins
a
little
rum
and
some
holidaypumpkin
pie
spices
weird
candy
aftertaste
for
some
odd
reason
not
so
nice
do
not
bother
its
a
thick
brownish
amber
color
with
hardly
any
head
at
all
wow
strong
aroma
ripe
plums
and
raisins
jump
out
at
me
and
maybe
a
spice
that
i
cant
name
its
all
malts
in
the
aroma
and
its
great
not
as
thick
on
the
palate
as
i
anticipated
its
not
thin
either
of
course
very
malty
not
much
hop
presence
to
speak
of
the
aroma
translates
directly
to
the
flavors
in
this
beer
its
quite
a
treat
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
on
top
of
the
malty
dark
fruit
and
spices
make
this
an
awesome
brew
a
nice
and
simple
label
is
also
an
aesthetic
plus
nose
was
very
slight
alcohol
note
promenent
in
the
flavor
profile
mostly
a
combination
of
rasins
slight
hopp
bite
and
brown
sugar
very
little
virtually
no
head
what
little
there
is
is
light
brown
and
quick
to
diminish
clear
dark
copper
in
color
heavy
malt
notes
with
aromas
of
molasses
maple
syrup
and
dark
fruits
quite
a
rich
aroma
with
not
much
hop
presence
at
all
sweet
rich
dark
fruit
flavors
and
quickly
noticeable
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
tart
with
notes
of
grapes
or
grape
skins
some
hops
that
are
a
somewhat
earthly
are
noticeable
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
however
and
times
it
seems
to
be
a
touch
watery
the
carbonation
is
soft
okay
brew
for
once
or
twice
a
year
but
not
one
ill
rush
to
next
christmas
season
this
was
a
nice
brew
but
a
little
pricey
that
was
cool
though
cause
this
rocked
it
was
a
nice
dark
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
the
head
wasnt
that
thick
but
lasted
the
whole
beer
it
was
more
bubbly
than
a
solid
head
which
was
an
indication
of
a
bit
of
carbonation
the
smell
was
nice
with
hints
of
caramel
and
some
darker
fruits
the
taste
was
similar
but
had
more
of
the
area
of
the
darker
fruits
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
a
chocolatey
vibe
this
was
a
great
brew
and
was
worth
the
money
that
was
spent
this
is
probably
my
fav
christmas
ale
that
i
have
had
this
year
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
is
rich
with
malts
and
a
smooth
edge
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
full
of
dark
and
crystal
malts
it
has
an
elevated
abv
8
1
but
it
tastes
great
the
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
it
drinks
well
a
good
seasonal
flavor
is
deeply
rich
with
long
chain
caramels
that
coat
the
palate
and
dance
on
the
tongue
with
a
delightful
step
the
finish
incorporates
a
combination
of
mineral
and
alcohol
that
cleans
off
the
palate
with
just
a
touch
of
lingering
dryness
whats
inside
soon
had
me
forgetting
the
lack
of
a
bottling
date
the
beer
is
a
somewhat
murky
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
some
small
champagnelike
bubbles
continue
to
work
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
beer
even
after
it
has
sat
for
a
while
the
smell
is
an
astounding
mix
of
ripe
fruit
raisin
cherry
and
plum
toffee
and
sweet
bread
despite
the
presence
of
sweet
fruit
and
candylike
flavors
a
bit
of
sour
bite
also
kicks
in
keeping
the
entire
affair
from
becoming
cloying
the
mouthfeel
could
be
slightly
chunkier
but
its
easy
to
overlook
in
light
of
the
delightful
smell
and
taste
its
certainly
not
a
session
beer
but
its
quite
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
its
style
it
has
a
charming
rustic
air
about
it
and
is
nice
stuff
for
a
cool
winter
day
after
a
fairly
hard
pour
a
little
tannish
beige
head
sit
upon
a
dark
amber
body
revealing
large
bubbles
then
fades
quicky
into
a
thinrimmed
coating
sweet
malt
damp
cellar
fruit
hops
and
alcohol
are
easily
noticed
a
hint
of
mint
and
a
herbal
smell
reminiscent
of
tarragon
linger
underneath
this
sweet
fruity
malty
brew
is
rich
in
flavor
and
somewhat
oily
in
texture
flavors
of
toffee
prune
juice
ripe
pears
and
candy
apples
are
quite
distinct
a
light
taste
of
lime
bitterness
and
portlike
alcohol
warmth
finish
this
unique
holiday
brew
a
good
beer
to
sit
by
the
fire
with
eclipse
dark

no

to
speak
of

is
dark

malts
and
dried
fruits
a
medium

full
bodied
strong
ale
malts
are
very
fruity
and
very
sweet
there
are
touches
of
wood
and
caramel
but
its
mostly
rich
malts
and
dark
fruits
it
reminds
me
of
a
sherry
more
than
anything
else
very
smooth
tasting
thick
and
if
not
for
some
tartness
it
would
be
cloyingly
sweet
as
it
is
its
a
nice
sipping
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and

that
lends
raisin

smoothing
out
but
keeping
its
thickness
with
trails
of

thats
slightly
burnt
and
finishes
with
a

of

floating

with

at

this

is

complexity
sweet

are
subtle

the
thick

sorry
harvey
comments

i
reviewed
the
elizabethan
ale
yesterday
and
this
has
to
be
from
the
same
barrel
classic
dark
ruby
brown
with
absolutely
no
head
or
lacing
pungeant
alcohol
and
caramel
aroma
thick
and
syrupy
body
with
a
strong
plum
and
sherry
flavor
even
sipping
this
one
made
it
difficult
to
drink
either
this
does
not
age
well
or
i
just
dont
like
it
the
finish
is
strong
alcohol
and
is
a
little
oily
not
impressed
at
all
with
this
one
a
longstanding
bottle
pours
a
clear
deep
mahogany
body
with
crimson
and
orange
highlights
beneath
a
thin
collar
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
theres
very
little
head
very
british
but
the
soft
and
smooth
mouthfeel
more
than
makes
up
for
that
it
has
a
very
fine
lowlevel
natural
carbonation
and
mediumfull
body
that
work
together
to
give
it
an
impressive
mouthfeel
the
nose
is
lightly
vinous
with
dark
fruit
plum
cherry
a
mild
note
of
currant
and
alcohol
but
reveals
some
caramel
with
further
investigation
the
flavor
is
less
fruity
than
the
nose
suggests
but
still
offers
rich
juicy
fruit
mainly
cherry
wrapped
in
caramel
and
light
cocoa
with
an
underlying
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
with
some
residual
fruit
and
caramel
that
slowly
dissolves
to
reveal
the
wide
bitterness
and
drying
alcohol
beneath
its
very
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
gives
a
pleasant
warmth
on
the
tongue
but
never
becomes
more
than
secondary
fairly
rich
and
complex
quite
nice
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
dark
brownred
with
a
tightly
clingy
off
white
very
small
head
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
hearty
almost
meaty
sort
of
flat
the
smell
is
toffee
like
malt
and
a
portlike
sweet
alcohol
the
taste
is
tealike
piney
and
nutty
with
a
slight
allspice
with
a
slightly
portlike
character
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
in
small
quantitiesvery
portlike
many
years
ago
i
had
the
greatest
fortune
to
attend
a
tour
of
harveys
brewery
a
gorgeous
picturesque
classic
victorian
tower
brewery
on
the
banks
of
the
oft
flooded
river
ouse
in
lewes
and
this
beer
just
like
the
tour
and
many
of
their
other
beers
does
not
disappoint
it
is
so
strange
to
think
that
this
beer
has
traveled
all
the
way
to
the
west
coast
a
little
bit
of
england
in
my
long
beach

thanks
to
bighugey
for
this
part
of
my
many
bottle
birthday
and
christmas
present
thanks
go
out
to
chaz
for
pointing
this
one
out
a
lot
better
than
the
elizabethan
ale
quite
a
raisiny
syrup
flavour
which
i
think
is
associated
with
most
harveys
brews
but
this
doesnt
go
too
over
the
top
and
it
least
it
has
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
which
adds
a
bit
to
the
dimention
of
the
beer
overall
but
still
a
little
to
sweet
in
my
eyes
notes
close
to
a
stock
ale
or
strong
ale
from
centuries
past
this
brew
is
indeed
a
well
fortified
brew
of
body
strength
and
complexity
the
most
impressive
winter
seasonal
i
have
had
from
the
uk
that
is
available
state
side

at
rnh
nyc
not
sure
who
thought
this
was
a
good
idea
not
to
my
liking
at
all
way
too
sour
thought
there
was
peppermint
in
the
aroma
but
didnt
find
it
elsewhere
other
references
claim
it
was
a
camra
winter
beer
of
britain
winner
remind
me
never
to
go
to
britain
in
the
winter
o
its
not
bad
although
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
winter
warmer
particularly
this
bottle
did
have
some
age
on
it
which
makes
the
booziness
even
more
surprising
this
one
makes
for
a
very
good
sipper
very
fruity
and
not
as
dark
as
i
had
expected
although
still
quite
sweet
you
can
definitely
feel
that
6
5
abv
after
a
few
drinks
and
it
is
quite
a
boozy

to

i
would
call
this
an
old
ale
not
a
winter
warmer
i
dont
taste
much
spicing
i
really
enjoyed
this
wish
this
was
available
more
often
a
rich
fruity
experience
quite
intense
definitely
one
to
sip
and
savour
a
pleasing
blend
of
flavours
that
rounds
out
nicely
a
quality
strong
ale
goes
down
nicely
on
a
cold
winter
night
well
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
much
like
bread
mouth
is
full
and
busy
the
beer
is
not
syrupy
but
is
still
thick
a
great
winter
warmer
sipper
dark
and
sweet
notes
is
this
a
barleywine
a
strong
ale
as
the
bottle
suggests
or
a
winter
warmer
as
ba
calls
it
i
guess
it
doesnt
matter
this
is
another
malty
sweet
beer
like
a
wee
heavy
but
without
the
peatiness
or
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
but
without
the
spices
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
and
7
5
abv
make
this
a
sipper
dont
drink
this
if
youre
in
a
hurry
its
a
beer
to
lay
down
and
avoid
a
bit
then
a
sip
and
then
another
laydown
good
stuff
d
a
delicious
strong
ale
from
manchester
although
good
in
bottled
form
this
comes
nowhere
near
to
its
cask
counterpart
which
is
a
real
brute
3
pints
of
this
beast
on
draught
and
you
will
know
about
it
so
will
your
pocket
while
not
bad
compared
to
most
english
beers
available
in
the
us
there
is
something
essential
missing
here
with
every
sip
i
wait
for
something
to
happen
or
to
change
but
it
never
does
d
a
surprisingly
flavorful
and
balanced
beer
drinkable
certianly
is
moonraker
too
bad
i
was
expecting
from
russia
with
love
d
this
beer
is
dark
and
dry
with
some
light
sugary
notes
and
soft
woodytoffee
raisin
qualities
the
softer
characters
make
this
easy
to
drink
and
beg
for
another
sip
to
try
and
figure
it
out
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
complexity
an
interesting
beer
thats
well
worth
a
shot
taste
is
spicey
raisin
prune
with
fermented
rich
whole
wheat
bread
dough
and
leafywoodypepperyspicey
character
on
the
swet
side
up
front
it
becomes
drier
in
the
middle
before
a
slightly
sweet
finish
nevertheless
backed
up
by
a
light
spicey
bitterness
with
the
hop
traits
noted
above
aftertaste
is
initially
drier
and
toasty
leafy
and
peppery
with
some
caramelised
prune
before
becoming
sweeter
feel
is
just
right
a
slight
oiliness
is
just
enough
to
give
it
enough
body
without
making
it
heavy
drinkability
is
exceedingly
high
this
is
excellent
i
dont
know
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
just
isnt
doing
a
lot
for
me
today
its
really
not
much
better
than
a
lot
of
english
style
brown
ales
out
there
which
is
what
this
beer
reminds
of
nothing
wrong
with
that
but
just
seems
like
it
could
be
so
much
more
md
being
semiclean
on
the
palate
or
at
least
cleaner
than
the
smell
would
tend
to
suggest
coupled
with
a
very
mildly
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
a
refreshingly
drybitter
palate
this
medplus
bodied
old
ale
is
as
wellstructured
as
it
is
delicious
i
would
very
much
like
to
try
the
caskconditioned
version
of
this
once
champion
winter
beer
of
britain
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
spices
and
malts
flavor
in
this
beer
seemed
to
clash
for
me
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
but
it
will
warm
you
up
and
has
above
average
flavor
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
but
if
you
happen
upon
it
you
might
as
well
give
it
a
shot
brewed
on
12
aug
09
and
drank
on
5
mar
10
taste
of
a
sweet
malty
brown
ale
with
some
brandyport
flavors
not
sure
if
these
are
from
spices
or
from
barrel
aging
slight
funk
presence
sa
well
smooth
drinking
light
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
a
lighter
old
ale
imo
with
some
additional
spices
a
great
brew
huge
complexity
thank
you
j
w
lees
for
serious
quality
meh
ive
had
much
better
examples
of
the
style
its
not
horrible
but
look
elsewhere
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
bit
of
moderate
carbonation
really
well
done
c
again
this
may
be
a
bit
out
of
date
or
it
may
not
even
if
this
is
a
bit
past
its
prime
i
dont
detect
a
lot
of
oxidation
here
im
just
not
completely
blown
away
by
this
beer
which
is
kind
of
unexpected
as
j
w
lees
is
such
a
renowned
brewery
due
to
this
perhaps
im
being
a
bit
hard
on
this
beer
bottom
line
its
tasty
its
classic
and
its
delightfully
british
is
it
worth
almost
six
dollars
for
a
pint
meh
d
this
was
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
this
was
another
good
example
of
a
beer
from
jw
lees
somewhat
of
a
spicy
winter
warmer
not
overdone
though
some
roastiness
but
mostly
sweet
caramel
the
taste
was
hops
and
and
berry
actually
grape
almost
too
grape
in
fact
it
was
also
mixed
with
an
oak
barrel
slightly
sweet
scot
taste
to
it
cloudy
amber
pour
very
little
white
head
nutty
citrus
with
some
malt
aroma
upfront
is
a
little
bitter
with
some
citrus
green
apple
mellows
out
into
a
real
nice
maltiness
the
fruit
continues
to
fade
as
the
beer
warms
the
maltiness
increases
with
some
toffee
and
prune
like
flavors
a
solid
medium
body
the
abv
isnt
exactly
strong
ale
like
but
i
thought
this
one
was
a
bit
under
rated
would
recommend
a
try
to
anyone
who
likes
a
traditional
old
ale
style
brew
for
those
that
prefer
a
strong
ale
as
basically
an
imperial
ipa
than
this
is
not
for
you
drinkability
is
exceptional
because
this
beer
is
exceptional
we
just
got
a
new
shipment
of
a
bunch
of
different
j
w
lees
before
which
id
only
had
them
at
festivals
now
that
ive
worked
though
what
they
were
offering
they
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
period
let
alone
from
the
u
k
d
fuck
that
8
sips
is
about
all
i
can
do
the
drinkability
was
good
this
beer
is
a
very
mild
mannered
character
although
i
think
that
the
sweetness
would
prove
tiring
after
a
pint
i
dont
think
id
reach
for
another
drinkability
i
sooo
want
more
at
6
69
a
bottle
its
very
likely
to
show
up
in
my
fridge
many
more
times
i
think
im
in
love
d
easy
to
drink
sweet
brew
solid
d
not
impressed
again
i
thought
i
had
an
old
bottle
but
several
other
reviewers
noted
the
intensely
sweet
flavor
and
syrupy
feel
very
drinkable
despite
sweetness
and
booziness
not
something
id
rush
out
and
buy
a
crate
of
but
for
a
change
and
a
headache
it
is
just
the
ticket
d
drinks
bigger
then
the
advertised
7
0abv
average
drinkability
and
as
per
the
label
pairs
nicely
with
crumbs
of
strong
english
cheese
to
which
i
would
likely
agree
aroma
is
rich
smoky
with
hints
of
molasses
and
coffee
what
i
call
stouty
since
i
am
partial
towards
porters
and
stouts
it
pours
a
dark
semiopaque
mahogany
with
a
finebubbled
and
fairly
persistent
head
flavor
is
smoky
and
malty
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
when
it
goes
down
the
hatch
it
leaves
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
which
complements
the
sweet
rather
than
clashing
a
flavorsome
and
enjoyable
beer
one
should
sip
and
savor
it
and
preferably
without
a
distraction
like
a
party
or
game
drinkability
was
average
to
say
the
least
due
to
the
presence
of
powerful
alcohol
and
the
cloying
sweet
flavors
almost
win
like
very
strong
flavor
i
feel
like
it
was
an
insult
to
my
favorite
beer
glass
to
pour
this
beer
into
it
all
in
all
a
good
beer
not
a
bad
pickup
winter
warmer
interesting
style
big
and
well
fermented
a
complex
brew
but
not
as
thick
as
other
strong
ale
types
d
i
think
id
prefer
this
in
a
12
oz
size
like
the
barleywine
this
is
a
sipper
its
great
and
one
id
have
again
drinkability
an
enjoyable
highly
quaffable
beer
im
not
sure
this
really
belongs
in
the
winter
warmer
category
but
whats
done
is
done
i
guess
plain
deep
amber
sort
of
color
no
real
carbonation
to
it
no
real
aromasomewhat
sharp
and
wine
like
deep
sweet
malty
flavor
though
not
overly
impressive
slight
bitterness
to
it
though
it
seems
more
from
alcohol
then
hops
somewhat
thin
body
wise
overall
pretty
average
all
around
no
big
deal
drinkability
on
this
is
low
i
just
couldnt
get
into
it
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
the
beer
too
watery
and
the
flavors
just
dont
mesh
well
into
anything
very
pleasant
a
curious
beer
ultimately
unsatisfying
im
sure
this
is
better
at
the
source
drinkability

this
one
was
a
bit
lackluster
maybe
a
fresher
bottle
will
change
my
mind
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
an
orange
tint
at
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
really
weak
head
big
bubbles
which
thin
out
rapidly
and
leave
nothing
but
a
very
thin
rinse
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
nothing
special
in
the
pour
for
sure
still
the
aroma
here
is
boisterous
fruity
scents
take
command
with
malted
tones
making
a
presence
but
with
much
more
reserve
apple
pear
prune
and
tasty
too
sweet
some
malty
sweetness
but
mostly
this
is
a
fruity
sweetness
not
sure
how
they
pull
this
off
without
actual
fruit
in
the
brewing
process
is
there
fruit
in
the
brewing
process
here
but
they
do
a
damn
fine
job
of
things
a
lightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
moonraker
would
serve
as
an
excellent
dessert
beer
or
afterdinner
drink
not
sure
i
would
pair
this
with
a
cheese
but
definitely
a
fruit
sorbet
or
plum
cake
is
there
such
a
thing
as
plum
cake
all
in
all
the
moonraker
is
a
fine
brew
fruity
and
strong
like
the
label
says
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
rather
enjoy
this
one
the
yeast
must
be
the
house
strain
over
at
j
w
lees
as
you
can
taste
some
similarities
to
the
harvest
ale
in
this
one
i
wonder
if
this
has
the
potential
to
age
as
well
i
personally
love
the
harvest
ale
and
this
one
pales
in
comparison
but
this
was
3
99
a
pint
compared
to
8
49
for
9
ounces
if
im
in
the
mood
and
cant
afford
it
this
is
a
decent
back
up
cheers
beertracker
poured
into
a
standard
english
pint
glass
with
an
initial
plop
releasing
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
reduced
to
14
then
held
firm
big
aromas
of
ripe
and
dark
fruits
with
a
bold
malt
base
that
hinges
on
toasty
and
caramels
a
mild
tart
fruitiness
berrylike
shows
complexity
and
age
the
flavors
verify
the
caramel
toffee
toasted
character
fruit
flavors
of
figs
peaches
almonds
and
raspberries
swirl
around
the
malts
and
add
varity
to
the
taste
the
feel
is
a
solid
and
persistent
bold
maltiness
with
firm
creaminess
that
is
tempered
only
by
the
berry
tawny
tartness
finishes
quite
malty
flavored
yet
intriguingly
light
and
dry
on
the
toung
good
warmer
for
any
season
overall
a
excellent
winter
warmer
recommended
more
attenuated
than
the
harvest
ale
and
holding
its
own
for
a
seven

cant
really

update

i
decided
to
crack
another
bottle
with
a
proper
fill
level
and
it
was
excellent
still
not
alot
of
carbonation
but
definitely
at
the
right
level
for
the
style
flavor
was
rich
and
the
mouthfeel
was
thicker
than
than
before
gritty
sediment
was
still
present
but
most
was
left
in
the
bottle
now
i
am
glad
i
bought
more
and
the
experience
has
tought
me
to
pay
attention
to
fill
levels
i
still
feel
the
7
price
tag
is
a
bit
steep
for
the
beer
but
nevertheless
a
great
offering
as
im
pouring
i
notice
that
the
beer
is
pouring
with
nary
a
bubble
in
sight
so
i
upend
the
bottle
and
i
am
able
to
coax
a
very
slight
head
out
of
this
which
quickly
fades
to
a
light
tan
ring
held
up
to
a
window
the
beer
is
on
the
lowest
edge
of
transparent
showing
a
ruby
world
smells
slightly
sour
but
not
in
a
spoiled
way
light
notes
of
sour
cherries
sugar
not
much
else
on
the
nose
tastes
of
slight
caramel
although
this
hides
behind
the
sweet
and
sour
berry
flavor
end
very
sweet
with
no
hop
bitterness
whatsoever
seems
to
pass
on
a
sweet
cherry
note
to
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
and
carbonation
is
almost
nonexistent
this
beer
gets
cloying
pretty
quickly
and
i
dont
see
myself
reaching
for
it
again
from
the
sweet
smell
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
perhaps
too
sweet
the
brewer
did
a
great
job
using
the
hops
and
alcohol
to
hold
the
sweetness
in
check
well
balanced
and
very
damn
drinkable
again
this
seems
like
a
little
cousin
to
the
harvest
ale
which
i
find
far
superior
this
is
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
would
never
choose
this
over
the
harvest
especially
with
the
5
99
price
tag
saludos
to
bross242
for
the
sample
clear
reddish
brown
body
and
a
small
head
made
this
beer
look
stately
but
boring
the
smell
was
little
too
fruity
for
my
liking
apart
from
unidentifiable
dark
skinned
dry
fruits
this
one
also
smelled
woody
and
sour
the
taste
was
pretty
much
same
as
the
smell
the
mix
of
sweet
sour
and
musty
flavors
didnt
quite
rise
to
undrinkable
standards
but
did
make
me
wince
every
time
i
took
a
sip
the
body
seemed
thin
at
first
but
after
while
it
got
to
be
more
substantial
usually
that
is
good
but
with
this
moonraker
more
flavors
were
not
necessarily
better
about
the
only
positive
was
the
well
hidden

abv
not
a
beer
id
care
to
drink
again
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
redish
tint
it
has
almost
not
head
other
than
from
splashing
and
looks
to
have
almost
no
carbonation
the
smell
is
of
ripe
dark
fruits
roasted
malts
and
maybe
a
flutter
of
hops
at
the
end
medium
bodied
with
the
fruits
and
roasted
flavors
leading
the
way
the
fruits
are
almost
overpowering
border
lining
on
sweet
caramel
flavors
as
well
almost
no
carbonation
makes
this
beer
tast
almost
juice
like
at
times
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
very
very
end
nothing
seems
to
balance
out
the
fruit
though
alcohol
isnt
very
apparent
in
the
taste
but
it
is
warming
i
can
see
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
beers
due
to
the
overpowering
fruit
flavors
would
be
great
with
some
winter
food
dishes
like
turkey
with
cranberry
sauce
though
mouthfeel
a
very
surprising
mix
of
drynes
and
fruity
sweetness
all
over
my
palate
this
was
a
barley
wine
ith
the
drinkability
of
a
bitter
or
pale
ale
not
very
well
integrated
or
especially
appealing
dull
brown
color
with
a
thin
and
diminishing
white
cream
aromatically
gentle
caramel
smelling
along
with
several
dark
ripe
fruits
completely
maltaccented
big
bubbly
and
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
finely
extracted
malt
tones
soft
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
very
sweet
and
a
bit
cloying
brash
alcohol
as
well
which
could
use
a
little
more
hop
light
almond
extract
flavor
as
well
drinkability
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
but
i
think
this
might
be
a
little
past
its
peak
this
beer
poured
a
deep
brownish
color
with
a
slight
white
head
with
good
lacing
the
beer
had
the
smell
of
deep
fruit
and
the
strong
alcohol
content
impressive
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
a
malty
sweetness
but
with
a
kick
of
the
abv
which
is
refreshing
and
gives
you
a
good
mouthful
500
ml
bottle
this
beer
came
a
dark
brown
with
faint
burgundy
highlights
the
head
was
very
thick
tan
and
heavy
smells
of
earthy
dark
fruits
and
caramel
tastes
of
a
sweet
smoky
molasses
and
burnt
caramel
with
a
slight
touch
of
sourness
that
runs
nicely
into
a
little
nip
of
earthy
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
easy
going
down
overall
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
flavors
profile
as
the
dark
fruit
molasses
and
herbal
elements
really
clash
a
dark
red
ruby
dark
brownish
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
is
constantly
fed
by
the
carbination
a
slight
alcohol
aroma
with
some
caramel
when
i
first
sipped
this
beer
to
me
it
was
very
sweet
that
for
me
contributes
to
the
average
drinkablity
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
not
bad
for
a
winter
warmer
shines
through
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
its
warm
and
slightly
fruity
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
warm
yet
highly
smooth
malty
flavor
that
is
sweet
at
the
start
and
dry
at
the
finish
it
has
a
nice
roasted
feel
with
some
subtle
fruity
hints
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
seasonal
brew
i
love
the
roasted
character
as
well
as
the
complex
flavors
a
good
drinker
i
accept
the
description
on
the
bottle
this
must
be
great
in
pies
and
such
straight
drinking
a
suitably
hopped
dark
beer
with
distinct
sourness
smooth
mouthfeel
nice
dark
colour
secondary
malt
and
licorice
somewhat
drinkable
must
be

treat
pours
a
nice
clear
deep
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
head
that
sticks
like
glue
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
leaving
globs
of
lace
behindhints
of
caramel
malt
and
brown
suger
in
the
nose
but
it
doesnt
really
stick
out
just
there
if
you
know
what
i
mean
a

bomb
here

in

pleasant

makes
this
beer
even
more
tasty
i
really
like
this
english
strong
ale
its
very
drinkable
for
the
style
overall
just
fine
nothing
stands
out
but
nothing
detracts
either
others
have
noted
the
price
and
it
is
a
bit
spendy
probably
could
do
better
for
less
this
brew
pours
a
ruby
color
with
brown
hints
a
finger
of
creamy
head
sits
atop
the
liquid
the
nose
is
caramel
brown
sugar
and
raisin
with
a
slight
spiceyness
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
pretty
nice
with
big
bit
of
brown
sugary
sweetness
and
a
very
big
spicy
raisiney
quality
to
it
i
find
this
to
be
very
enjoyable
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
i
like
it
its
not
a
fantastic
beer
but
above
average
everything
melds
well
together
and
makes
a
nice
brew
pours
a
brownish
red
color
with
a
tall
head
that
falls
quickly
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
seems
faint
but
there
is
a
little
caramel
some
slight
dark
fruits
lots
of
flavors
dark
fruits
toffee
caramel
quite
a
bit
of

a
little
coffee
andor
chocolate

body
and
good
drinkability
some
slightly
odd

interesting
beer
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
minimal
uneven
tan
head
over
the
cloudy
deep
red
brew
head
and
lacing
are
both
lacking
to
say
the
least
aroma
is
vinous
and
dark
fruits
reminds
me
of
their
harvest
ale
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
for
the
style
with
a
slight
spicy
flavor
mouthfeel
is
relatively
creamy
but
the
bitterness
is
somewhat
offputting
and
drinkability
is
similar
not
as
overly
spiced
as
some
winter
warmers
are
but
this
one
has
room
for
improvement
moonraker
is
okay
but
there
are
much
better
winter
warmers
than
this
in
fact
ive
had
a
few
from
lesser
known
american
brewers
that
could
kick
its
ass
to
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
and
back
drinkability

very
smooth
very
easy
on
the
palate
a
bit
warming
a
nice
winter
warmer
not
the
best
ive
had
but
far
from
the
worst
aroma
is
fruity
with
citrus
most
noticable
to
my
olfactory
spicing
is
on
the
mild
side
with
a
dry
finish
a
deep
garnet
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
starts
about
34
of
an
inch
then
fades
to
18
inch
decent
lacing
perhaps
the
true
test
of
a
beer
is
would
i
buy
it
again
yep
ok
but
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
dark
plum
with
a
nice
tan
head
of
foam
that
lasted
for
quite
a
while
the
aroma
of
this
brew
was
all
about
the
big
fruity
malts
i
got
hints
of
plums
pudding
cranberries
various
nuts
and
more
like
an
excellent
winter
cake
in
a
bottle
the
taste
was
sweet
fruity
and
malty
up
front
with
some
complex
fruit
and
nut
notes
in
the
middle
and
a
very
smooth
finish
that
left
a
lingering
dark
fruit
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodiedthick
but
perfect
and
the
drinkability
was
good
as
well
not
as
good
as
their
harvest
ale
but
another
winner
from
manchester
nonetheless
has
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
hints
of
red
no
head
to
see
but
left
a
tiny
lacing
along
the
sides
which
says
resin
to
me
alcohol
dates
and
maybe
some
sugary
nose
tasting
this
made
me
feel
as
though
i
had
a
cold
definitely
some
sort
of
cough
syrup
feel
and
taste
a
lot
of
alcohol
followed
by
a
syrup
character
with
yeast
and
some
molasses
perhaps
this
is
a
bad
bottle
but
i
really
dont
agree
with
the
other
reviews
on
this
ive
had
much
better
drinkabilityis
very
nice

this

a
dark

with
a
thin

thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
lighter
body
than
most
barley
wines
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
caramel
and
fruit
the
finish
is
very
sweet
and
borderline
cloying
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
maybe
a
beginners
barley
wine
due
to
the
lighter

and
more
sedate
flavors
poured
a

with
a

was

quite
an
inviting

the
taste
was
caramel

dark
red
fruit
and
a
bourbon
quality
all
that
malty
sweetness
then
snaps
to
a
very
dry

mingles
with
a
bit
of

fumy
alcohol
the
slightly
biscuity
caramel
malt
reveals
a
nice
nutty
flavor
with
a
light

it
the
hops
are
in
abundance
sharpedged
white

a

of
a

backbone
stays
throughout
i
can
only
guess
that
j
w
may
have
a
quality
control
issue
based
on
the
many
high
and
low
ratings
it
has
received
this
particular
bottle
is
quite
good
good
to
the
point
where
i
cant
imagine
anyone
not
liking
it
its
a
malty
one
and
a
tasty
one
and
near

the

starts
to
get
up
and
drag
you
out
by
the
trousers
dark
ruby
in
colour
with
a
healthy
white
head
that
lasts
quite
long
before
diminishing
aroma
hops
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
rich
roasty
malty
flavours
on
the
tongue
chewy
even
a
nice
warming
ale
supposedly
named
for
some
mancunians
who
apparently
tried
to
rake
the
moons
reflection
out
of
a
river
the
pour
and
head
both
look
good
but
a
little
short
it
looks
like
this
beer
is
only
9
89
oz
not
going
to
lie
but
im
little
disappointed
seeing
that
i
expected
12
the
color
is
blackened
brown
and
the
foam
looks
good
first
sip
is
smooth
basically
tasting
like
newcastle
brown
ale
then
hints
of
liquorish
malt
hop
chalk
and
vanilla
sweet
delicate
flavors
then
bombarded
the
taste
buds
man
be
careful
pouring
i
had
some
clumps
in
my
pint
interesting
beer
and
the
taste
has
england
all
over
it
well
balanced
brown
ale
a
bit
sweet
nice
with
pudding
dark
mahogany
brown
color
appears
slightly
clearish
overall
with
light
transmission
at
the
bottom
of
the
pint
glass
very
soft
yellow
head
of
about
12
inch
to
start
laces
thickly
some
cocoa
to
the
deep
smell
some
carob
as
well
lighter
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
but
the
flavor
is
decently
full
expressing
chocolate
powder
light
coffee
tones
and
a
burnt
profile
close
to
the
end
some
slight
sense
of
alcohol
but
relatively
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
good
enough
beer
but
i
have
to
admit
i
was
expecting
better
mouthfeel
and
a
little
more
complexity
to
write
about
drinkability

this
is
definitely
9
ounces
of
sipping
ale
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
strong
and
clumsy
and
may
not
be
to
everyones
liking
the
feel
is
distinctly
smooth
and
creamy
with
no
sense
of
overload
from
the
fullness
of
the
body
this
is
a
delightfully
rich
and
drinkable
ale
very
nice
add
it
all
together
and
its
pretty
good
just
doesnt
blow
my
socks
off
tastes
very
alcoholic
like
drinking
bourban
worth
trying
one
bottle
i
will
not
buy
this
one
again
turbid
and
murky
brown
appearance
just
a
collaring
of
light
brown
head
aroma
has
caramel
wood
toffee
smoke
and
prunes
good
is
a
bit
of
an
understatement
the
smoke
and
toffee
are
the
primarys
on
the
buds
some
bitterness
enters
the
equation
leather
as
well
raisins
and
rumcake
licorice
as
well
decent
enough
but
nowhere
near
the
class
of
their
harvest
ales
pat
drinkability
very
good
a
ver
nice
strong
ale
bottle
conditioned
enjoyed
at
50f
carefully
poured
the
body
is
a
slightly
hazy
rich
mahogany
with
an
orangecast
and
crimson
highlights
its
topped
by
a
thin
but
creamy
lighttan
head
that
holds
surprisingly
well
and
leaves
thin
and
spotty
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
displays
toffee
mild
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
its
quite
estery
as
it
warms
however
some
more
caramel
notes
begin
to
appear
a
full
body
coupled
with
a
very
fine
and
gentle
carbonation
gives
an
exceptionally
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
emphasises
the
maltiness
the
flavor
is
far
more
complex
than
the
nose
alludes
to
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
prune
raisin
toffee
scortched
caramel
honey
oak
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
it
finishes
with
a
rising
bitterness
and
unique
hop
flavor
thats
not
unlike
wet
leafy
whole
hops
left
in
the
wort
at
the
end
of
the
boil
lightly
earthy
herbal
and
resiny
but
dripping
with
malt
it
combines
with
the
residual
semisweet
dark
malt
to
give
a
lingering
licorice
note
well
balanced
and
quite
unique
a
splendid
rich
and
complex
old
ale
thats
not
quite
accessible
as
old
peculier
but
ultimately
more
rewarding
to
those
willing
to
delve
a
little
deeper
if
old
ale
is
your
tipple
this
one
is
not
to
be
missed
it
was
the
first
and
probably
the
last
time
ill
drink
this
brew
it
starts
with
a
unappealing
sweet
molasses
aroma
roasted
malt
molasses
and
toffee
are
all
apparent
at
first
then
a
strong
alcohol
feel
takes
over
it
has
more
chunks
and
sediment
than
any
beer
i
have
ever
seen
it
wasnt
a
very
enjoyable
sight
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
dont
seem
to
important
at
this
point
ok
i
know
that
this
review
will
be
harsh
but
take
it
as
a
warning
do
not
get
an
old
bottle
the
bottle
i
purchased
must
have
been
sitting
at
the
store
for
years
it
poured
very
thick
with
no
head
at
all
it
had
huge
chunks
all
throughout
it
went
right
down
the
drain

ill
just

overall
the

was
a

surprise
and
flavor
had
more
hop
involvement
than
i
expected
as
well
very
enjoyable
so
i
got
these
really
cheap
in

and
i
got
what
i
paid
for

will
i
ever
learn
overall

this
beer
is
pretty
one

enjoyable
for
what
it
is
the
beer
does
go
down
very
easy
and
i
find
it
a
nice
treat
for
the
evening
nothing
outstanding
but
a
nice
malty
treat
overall
i
consider
this
is
an
interesting
pale
ale
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
winter
ale
but
good
overall
when
i
had
my
first
one
of
these
i
thought
it
was
average
but
over
the
next
few
day
i
had
a
few
more
and
each
time
i
discovered
something
new
with
it
i
find
this
to
be
a
great
example
of
the
winter

style
as
this
has
become
a

beer
for
me
rjt
just
to
note
this

winter
of
20132014
is

the

so
some

may
sound

they

brew
is
among
the
better
ones
i
have
tasted
in
the
series
you
dont
get
the
nutmegcinnamon
and
other
spices
like
you
commonly
taste
in
the
typical
winter
seasonal
this
is
a
more
straight
forward
beer
without
the
holiday
additives
i
like
it
more
and
more
with
each
passing
sip
and
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
that
most
guests
at
your
next
holiday
party
will
feel
the
same
give
it
sampling
and
enjoy
the
taste
of
the
season
courtesy
of
redhook
tasty
enough
brew
it
isnt
the
big
winter
warmer
i
was
expecting
but
it
is
certainly
a
tasty
ale
with
a
good
hop
presence
one
of
red
hooks
best
good
for
a
winter
warmer
i
could
get
next
to
the
fire
with
this
one
redhook
winter
hook
35
not
an
easy
sipper
overall
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
offering
from
redhook
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
coming
together
and
they
all
work
really
well
one
to
pick
up
if
you
see
it
nice
amber
color
great
sweet
hoppy
aroma
first
impression
is
of
a
winter
pale
ale
spicy
pine
and
hop
notes
it
becomes
more
bitter
as
you
drink
but
the
flavor
holds
throughout
flavor
holds
through
the
finish
nice
winter
beer
but
it
could
improve
in
sweetness
and
depth
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
definitely
overall
our
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
complexity
for
the
style
here
they
seemed
less
focused
on
the
malt
profile
allowing
for
a
generous
aromatic
hop
bite
to
permeated
the
sip
the
aroma
showed
more
of
this
as
well
with
bright
green
freshness
of
hops
and
paler
grain
this
paleness
does
give
a
cheapness
to
the
end
of
the
swallow
and
while
this
one
isnt
as
warming
as
others
for
the
style
it
will
certainly
keep
you
away
on
a
cold
winters
afternoon
a
pretty
decent
winter
warmer
this
used
to
be
one
of
the
several
winter
beers
id
look
forward
to
and
it
does
have
some
fruity
charms
increasing
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
wins
back
no
old
friends
however
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
barons
marketplace
in
san
diego
overall
definitely
did
not
disapoint
honestly
pouring
this
into
the
glass
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
winter
warmer
maybe
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
grab
a
glass
and
drink
up
salud
o
gotta
love
a
hoppy
warmer
intense
earthy
flavors
bordering
dirt
in
the
mouth
pine
and
hints
of
fruit
compliment
the
roasty
sweet
malts
a
great
treat
for
winter
that
im
eager
to
try
the
slightly
altered
version
next
year
cheers
o
winterhook
comes
in
a
cool
bottle
its
a
cool
warmer
so
to
speak
the
45
ibus
dont
come
on
too
strong
making
it
easy
drinking
nice
a
good
well
made
but
plain
volksbier
flavors
are
similarly
ill
defined
some
bread
malt
and
vague
dry
spiciness
but
utterly
indistinct
and
nebulous
tea
and
herbal
notes
kind
of
like
an
old
pale
ale
with
faded
hops
sharp
and
highly
carbonated
seems
like
a
lager
with
odd
adjuncts
in
it
not
a
seasonal
beer
to
seek
out
really
glad
it
was
free
overall
excellent
tasting
beer
that
makes
one
forget
about
winter
or
at
least
momentarily
forget
about
winter
check
it
out
if
you
get
a
chance
the
last
of
a
sixer
i
wanted
to
get
familiar
with
the
beer
first
the
color
is
a
clear
chestnut
a
small
offwhite
head
recedes
quickly
with
islands
of
lacing
the
aroma
holds
bread
and
sugar
with
a
touch
of
apricot
the
flavor
is
malty
and
earthy
no
real
noticeable
alcohol
body
is
medium
texture
is
very
soft
low
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
makes
a
nice
nightcap
i
truly
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
a
winter
warmer
and
this
can
be
good
in
the
right
circumstances
but
it
misses
the
center
band
of
the
style
just
a
bit
overall
a
nice
tasty
slightly
sweeter
yet
still
roasty
and
spiced
holiday
brew
it
has
a
nice
feel
and
price
which
when
mixed
with
the
good
taste
make
for
a
brew
to
try
and
one
to
possibly
go
back
to
again
and
again
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
herbal
hops
and
a
slight
spice
note
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
drinkability
a
unique
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
can
i
use
of
these
during
the
summer
fishing
outings
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
ambertopaz
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
mixed
greens
very
light
menthol
and
sweet
nutty
toffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
mild
pine
needles
and
something
that
sort
of
approaches
a
shadow
of
ginger
gotta
say
this
sits
very
poorly
on
my
tongue
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
muddled
unpleasant
winter
warmer
nuff
said
overall
though
the
vintage
changes
every
year
this
winter
warmer
drinks
almost
like
a
dark
pale
ale
surprising
amount
of
hop
character
for
a
winter
warmer
and
is
a
refreshing
option
in
the
holiday
rotation
this
beer
grew
on
me
a
lot
wasnt
anywhere
close
to
as
good
as
the
widmer
brr
i
just
had
but
it
hit
the
spot
id
have
it
again
light
mid
and
drinks
well
alcohol
is
non
existent
the
flavors
were
just
a
bit
of
a
miss
for
me
did
improve
a
bit
as
it
warmed
o
good
beer
has
all
the
deliciousness
of
a
good
winter
warmer
and
only
costs
1
90
for
a
22oz
bottle
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
copper
color
with
amber
highlights
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
spices
taste
is
malty
bready
some
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
good
flavor
but
not
great
for
this
style
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
o
just
ok
with
me
well
brewed
but
tending
towards
the
sweeter
and
sugary
side
of
the
balance
line
hops
are
not
a
big
player
here
unfortunately
perhaps
just
not
really
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
beer
at
this
moment
overall
not
a
bad
winter
brew
i
have
had
this
one
quite
a
bit
over
the
years
cant
really
go
wrong
with
it
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
that
was
very
drinkable
although
it
is
nothing
over
the
top
notes
solid
winter
warmer
it
did
have
a
bit
of
an
english
feel
to
it
as
well
not
heavy
on
the
spices
but
a
strong
roasted
nut
and
carameltoffee
winter
beer
i
wasnt
amazed
by
it
but
would
drink
it
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
the
style
m
lighter
side
of
medium
thick
adequately
carbonated
semismooth
texture
pours
brownishcopper
with
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
is
quite
subtle
nothing
bad
but
nothing
good
either
there
is
a
solid
malt
profile
upfront
with
very
tasty
roasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
solid
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
o
good
beer
for
the
style
and
good
for
me
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
hops
add
an
awesome
finish
to
this
brew
o
theres
not
much
warming
in
this
winter
warmer
but
it
is
an
easytodrink
winter
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
something
that
is
malty
and
fuller
bodied
i
like
that
there
is
a
winter
warmer
that
is
a
little
hoppier
and
not
so
over
spiced
this
is
though
a
little
simple
and
im
indifferent
about
it
overall
nothing
really
stands
out
for
me
o
not
bad
but
i
dont
know
if
id
get
it
again
o
why
cant
longhammer
have
this
kind
of
hop
character
this
is
real
good
beer
and
at
sub2
a
bomber
its
a
steal
one
of
redhooks
best
without
a
doubt
redhooks
winter
ale
is
fantastic
pours
a
dark
brown
with
two
fingers
of
foamy
head
spices
are
perfectly
balanced
with
an
unexpected
amount
of
hops
chocolate
mixes
with
grapefruit
to
create
a
truly
original
winter
ale
nuts
and
malts
create
a
nice
backbone
and
a
delicious
finish
this
20112012
version
was
sampled
on
tap
this
is
important
because
ive
heard
they
change
the
recipe
from
yeartoyear
the
color
was
clear
copper
with
a
big
khaki
head
that
retained
decently
and
left
sliding
spots
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
not
as
spicy
as
it
had
been
in
the
past
showcasing
caramel
malt
and
piney
hops
instead
with
only
hints
of
clove
the
flavors
were
a
bit
heavy
on
the
herbalpiney
hops
at
first
with
a
caramel
malt
backbone
and
hints
of
toasted
nuts
and
toffee
behind
that
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
midlevel
not
as
spiced
as
many
winter
warmers
which
i
found
welcome
though
nothing
amazing
as
a
standalone
brew
either
o
this
is
the
best
redhook
i
have
tried
its
not
quite
what
i
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
but
what
it
is
is
good
very
approachable
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
tried
from
redhook
and
a
great
one
in
the
style
i
liked
it
more
than
great
lakes
christmas
ale
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
it
as
it
gives
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
it
definitely
has
its
flaws
but
a
good
brew
to
try
if
you
like
the
winter
warmer
style
winter
hook
does
a
good
job
showcasing
some
toasted
maltiness
and
a
light
roastyhoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
hops
have
a
moderate
presence
all
the
way
through
and
the
yeast
is
pretty
clean
for
the
most
part
pretty
straightforward
beer
that
is
more
akin
to
a
hopleaning
amber
ale
than
a
winter
warmer
but
decently
tasty
brew
there
are
too
many
great
winter
seasonals
to
buy
this
one
very
often
though
defiantly
not
the
best
winter
warmer
out
there
but
i
would
gladly
session
with
this
after
a
day
of
shreding
the
gnar
at
crystal
mtn
o
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
nothing
super
fancy
but
the
hop
character
was
a
nice
deviation
from
the
norm
for
the
style
overall
not
something
i
would
reach
for
again
and
pretty
light
for
a
winter
warmer
drink
is
balanced
for
what
it
is
but
it
just
taste
like
their
esb
only
double
which
means
too
much
herbal
tea
flavors
red
hook
winterhook
is
a
super
clear
dark
amber
beer
with
a
soft
waxy
light
khaki
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
there
is
some
lightly
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
medicine
and
wood
resin
its
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
slightly
gritty
finish
it
doesnt
taste
too
sweet
but
there
is
plenty
of
malt
and
a
little
medicinal
bitterness
its
very
warming
it
tastes
stronger
than
it

is
slightly
warming
enjoyable
winter
hook
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
it
is
probably
worth
a
try
especially
because
it
tends
to
pop
up
at
places
that
might
not
have
a
stellar
tap
list
overall
i
really
dont
know
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
its
all
over
the
place
and
i
dont
like
the
bitterness
in
it
needs
more
malts
and
caramel
o
been
drinking
some
shit
beer
tonight
getting
tired
of
it
overall
worth
a
try
at
least
worth
getting
a
6er
if
you
like
hoppy
big
flavored
beers
d
surprisingly
good
from
an
underestimated
brewery
anheuser
busch
has
the
rights
to
this
one
around
here
and
thanks
to
my
sales
rep
ty
for
the
sample
light
and
mellow
winter
warmer
this
is
a
good
all
around
holiday
beer
the
hops
and
cocoa
seem
to
give
it
a
holiday
spice
without
being
forced
good
stuff
for
7
99
o
i
generally
prefer
less
hopped
winter
warmers
but
this
wasnt
bad
i
feel
like
it
was
very
comparable
to
the
never
summer
ale
and
would
call
it
a
tie
o
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
it
is
uninteresting
when
cold
this
is
a
nice
if
rather
nondescript
beer
there
are
more
interesting
winter
warmers
out
there
but
this
is
still
a
decent
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
copperbrown
an
offwhite
head
rings
and
stays
smell
is
chiefly
brown
sugar
taste
is
a
bitter
affair
in
a
good
way
pleasant
mild
hops
and
the
underpinning
acrid
nuttiness
of
a
brown
ale
feel
is
tight
and
tart
with
ginger
coming
into
presence
finishes
with
a
metallic
and
grapefruit
aftertaste
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
that
im
thankful
isnt
slamming
me
over
the
face
with
spices
o
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
winter
warmer
designation
always
throws
me
bc
you
never
know
what
youll
get
this
beer
is
warming
well
balanced
and
perfect
for
a
cold
night
very
drinkable
will
buy
again
o
this
beer
is
a
definite
must
try
it
is
has
an
exclusive
floral
taste
that
is
well
complimented
with
its
strong
hop
profile
the
value
of
this
beer
is
also
great
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
very
worth
a
price
perfect
winter
drinker
and
quite
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
with
no
problems
at
any
rate
this
stuff
is
good
beer
and
it
deserves
a
good
review
winterhook
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
think
most
would
enjoy
however
its
not
memorable
given
the
light
hop
flavor
i
never
would
have
guessed
that
redhook
used
4
hop
varieties
lastly
i
dont
understand
what
makes
it
a
winter
seasonal
its
a
very
middleoftheroad
beer
that
doesnt
offer
anything
unique
or
different
overall
at
almost
6
this
did
not
age
well
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
version
poured
a
clear
chestnut
color
with
a
frothy
beige
head
that
retains
well
toasty
malts
in
the
aroma
nutty
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
nutty
taste
malty
toasty
a
bit
bland
some
light
hops
come
through
near
the
end
for
a
slightly
bitter
finish
medium
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
drinkable
but
not
that
great
reminded
me
more
of
an
amber
ale
than
a
winter
warmer
or
strong
ale
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
reddish
brown
color
the
head
was
alright
kinda
thin
not
much
lacing
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
spicy
and
a
little
roasted
the
taste
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
mostly
some
dark
mark
in
the
flavor
there
seems
to
be
just
a
hint
of
pine
or
spruce
in
within
deep
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
drinkable
but
i
just
didnt
feel
that
this
winter
warmer
was
really
up
to
par
this
is
a
lovely
cold
weather
beer
that
is
medium
to
light
bodied
so
it
wont
beat
your
palate
like
a
stout
very
well
done
o
good
beer
above
average
but
not
by
a
lot
verdict
i
came
down
hard
on
this
beers
appearance
and
aroma
but
i
would
like
to
think
that
the
excessive
aging
may
have
had
some
sort
of
a
negative
impact
on
that
however
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
didnt
fade
nearly
as
much
in
fact
they
may
have
flourished
this
was
a
good
introductory
beer
into
redhooks
lineup
for
me
i
will
recommend
but
also
insist
that
the
drinker
gets
the
beer
as
soon
as
it
comes
out
so
keep
your
eyes
peeled
and
dont
expect
to
be
disappointed
b

freshness
of
the
keg
is
in
play
here
but
it
was
recommended
by
the
bartender
as
a
hoppy
beer
wrong
average
offering
at
best
d
not
a
bad
quaff
id
hit
up
a

to
share
with
friends
with
no
reservation
at
all
d
not
sessionable
imo
but
very
nice
for
one
or
two
good
winter
seasonal
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
to
have
throught
the
winter
months
as
the
name
would
suggest
bready
spicy
aroma
with
somewhat
of
a
fruited
undertone

a
ruddy
brown
color
seems
to
glow
under
bar
room
lighting
hints
of
spices
are
laced
throughout
the
breadiness
of
this
beer
overall
for
a
winter
heavier
beer
its
incredibly
easy
to
drink
could
session
it
great
beer
to
try
would
be
a

something

there
are

this
ones
a

a
6pack
are
you
kidding
me
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
a
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
winter
ale
d
very
drinkable
and
the
folks
at
redhook
dont
often
dissapoint
with
any
beers
i
have
tried
great
way
to
relax
after
work
on
a
snowy
winters
day
like
the
sign
on
a
junkyard
i
sometimes
pass
striving
to
be
above
average
nice
browncopper
color
lots
of
nutty
roasted
malt
notes
leaning
a
bit
toward
the
sweet
side
winter
warmer
more
of
a
robust
brown
ale
pleasant
but
not
memorable
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
a
little
bitter
but
not
too
much
just
right
for
my
taste
buds
it
seems
a
little
light
actually
for
a
winter
warmer
but
the
nutty
flavor
does
bring
out
a
bit
more
fuller
quality
httpbeerandboise
wordpress
com
the
body
is
medium
at
most
and
has
plenty
of
smooth
feel
and
carbonation
to
keep
it
alive
it
is
by
no
means
a
sipper
by
the
fire
but
the
lingering
bitter
finish
offers
excellent
drinkability
and
enough
flavor
to
satisfy
another
offering
from
redhook
thats
worth
a
look
but
not
worth
any
sort
of
extra
effort
to
obtain
taste
is
mild
all
around
every
redhook
beer
ive
had
tastes
like
a
good
beer
that
has
been
watered
down
this
one
is
no
exception
light
hop
mal
if
this
is
a
winter
beer
where
are
the
spices
i
detect
none
mild
sweet
aftertaste
this
beer
is
decent
and
drinkable
but
i
sure
had
higher
expectations
average
all
around
d
i
am
all
for
getting
another
6er
of
this
that
really
is
the
best
way
to
tell
if
you
enjoy
a
beer
will
i
be
buying
this
again
you
betcha
its
not
an
above
average
beer
but
after
sampling
all
the
watery
beers
ive
had
today
it
tastes
like
a
champion
definatly
one
of
the
more
drinkable
winter
warmers
its
cheap
widely
available
offers
a
sessionable
abv
decent
hops
i
definatly
would
recommend
this
beautifully
balanced
very
drinkable
overall
thoughtsopinions
nice
and
pleasant
but
not
freaking
amazing
i
think
this
little
option
would
fit
more
in
a
nw
ipa
category
rather
than
a
winter
warmer
but
who
am
i
to
advise
redhook
ill
have
to
try
a
jubelale
snowcap
celebration
and
sammy
smith
winter
welcome
in
the
near
future
to
see
if
the
winterhook
is
more
like
an
ipa
or
if
my
preferencesfamiliarities
have
changed
this
poured
dark
amber
with
notable
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
it
smelled
and
tasted
malty
and
toasty
it
had
a
well
balanced
taste
that
wasnt
too
sweet
or
smoky
i
would
classify
this
as
moderately
crisp
and
medium
bodied
making
it
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
however
after
i
finished
i
started
to
get
that
sour
muck
taste
that
sometimes
follows
beer
i
still
think
winterhook
is
pretty
solid
and
will
come
back
to
it
next
winter
drinks
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
id
buy
again
but
not
all
the
time
would
make
a
nice
addition
to
a
holiday
dinner
overall
decent
for
a
winter
warmer
would
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
necessarily
buy
it
again
m
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
smooth
and
rich
good
flavor
and
good
balance
you
will
taste
refreshing
fruit
in
the
front
which
is
immediately
balanced
with
mild
bittersweet
hops
very
smooth
finish
and
fresh
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
wish
i
could
drink
that
one
on
tab
or
from
a
fresh
keg
nice
beer
d
an
okay
winter
warmer
will
probably
not

anymore

value

paid

for

killer
overall
a
decent
brew
as
with
a
lot
of
redhooks
brews
it
makes
for
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
or
to
help
bring
someone
over
from
the
light
side
d
a
very
drinkable
ale
but
also
not
memorable
enough
to
seek
out
again
overall
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
cold
temperatures
so
cant
ask
for
much
more
but
it
seems
all
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
so
bland
and
subtle
theres
no
reason
to
choose
this
over
another
winter
ale
d
a
nicedrinking
beer
but
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
sessionable
for
sure
d
this
is
a
solid
winter
offering
big
malty
flavors
and
but
still
balanced
generally
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
brewer
but
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
redhook
this
beer
did
not
impress
me
much
like
other
of
the
redhook
beers
ive
tried
i
thought
that
the
beer
was
going
to
change
my
mind
about
redhook
but
instead
it
isnt
showing
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
it
is
winter
in
a
place
notoriously
bombarded
with
snow
so
i
was
feeling
chipper
to
drink
a
winterale
i
was
persuaded
by
a
beer
salesman
to
give
it
a
shot
it
poured
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
head
the
smell
was
a
caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
whiffs
of
chocolatiness
as
well
first
taste
hmmm
whered
it
all
go
i
didnt
taste
much
more
than
what
i
could
just
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
short
of
lame
no
chewiness
to
it
at
all
the
drinkibility
may
be
there
where
you
can
keep
drinking
it
without
savoring
it
but
that
also
means
i
do
not
care
for
savoring
much
less
drinking
too
much
more
of
this
beer
there
are
better
winter
ales
that
are
cheaper
than
this
too
oh
well
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
beer
not
exactly
my
favorite
its
a
little
sweet
but
finishes
bitter
still
a
good
beer
if
you
see
it
on
sale
definitely
snatch
some
up
but
otherwisewith
so
many
great
winter
ales
in
the
marketyou
could
pass
on
this
one
without
fearing
that
you
had
missed
anything
earthshaking
d
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
the
spices
arent
much
for
a
winter
warmer
there
is
something
in
the
aftertaste
that
becomes
a
tad
wearing
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
with
slight
red
tint
with
fair
head
and
lace
smell
of
citrus
caramel
and
light
roasted
malt
taste
has
a
sweet
roasty
caramel
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
smooth
medium
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
so
overall
a
very
nice
balance
making
a
very
good
winter
ale
drinkability
not
too
heavy
and
smooth
drinking
overall
a
nice
ale
it
is
a
bit
watery
for
me
but
has
a
decent
flavor
profile
still
needs
more
to
distinguish
it
as
a
winter
warmer
just
not
a
beer
that
reminds
me
too
much
of
winter
mouthfeeldrinkability
average
d
solid
drinkability
for
a
warmer
certainly
a
bit
filling
and
a
bit
too
sweet
for
summer
months
but
certainly
does
the
trick
for
the
winter
abv
will
surely
warm
you
but
probably
not
bite
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
underlie
the
surface
good
hopping
serviceable
this
was
a
pleasent
suprise
and
a
very
good
winter
ale
its
a
pleasant
enough
brew
but
its
a
little
to
o
thin
and
watery
at
times
this
is
a
good
one
for
winter
if
youre
not
into
overly
spiced
brews
and
a
good
median
between
that
type
and
the
christmas
ales
that
are
in
fact
ipas
d
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
ale
a
little
strong
on
the
grape
notes
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
since
it
is
not
as
heavy
and
filling
as
some
others
and
the
abv
is
only
5
9
one
of
redhook
ales
better
offerings
of
late
d
smooth
well
balanced
beer
no
harshness
present
easy
to
drink
d
this
really
reminds
me
of
snpa
but
with
a
smooth
start
and
thicker
body
great
winter
beer
conclusion
good
solid
winter
warmer
brewed
in
the
english
tradition
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
this
is
unique
enough
to
stand
on
its
own
yet
approachable
for
those
just
getting
into
craft
beer
im
going
to
make
it
a
point
to
get
this
into
my
winter
rotation
much
more
regularly
it
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
is
a
good
one
similar
to
a
less
hoppy
pyramid
snowcap
drinkbability
would
be
a
great
winter
beer
without
the
scary
spicehop
very
effective
as
a
winter
warmer
almost
compelling
nose
is
caramel
a
slight
spice
and
hops
and
that
is
about
it
some
alcohol
comes
through
taste
is
bland
but
the
hops
do
bitter
the
mouth
up
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
a
little
oily
and
ok
overall
this
beer
smells
very
hoppy
but
tastes
more
malty
complex
flavor
and
still
very
drinkable
for
your
average
beer
drinker
one
of
the
better
redhooks
ive
had
not
bad
pours
a
clear
amber
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
strongly
of
hops
slight
spice
aroma
and
some
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
winter
warmer
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
hops
bitterness
is
present
up
front
slight
spice
comes
through
second
all
spice
then
theres
a
sweet
malt
background
with
a
very
smooth
finish
of
hops
and
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
wow
this
is
a
well
blended
beer
heavy
on
the
hops
my
favorite
easy
to
drink
and
low
enough
in
abv
to
allow
me
to
drink
a
few
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
great
beer
worth
a
try
got
a
12
pack
for
7
99
so
thought
id
give
it
a
try
good
beer
at
that
price
overall
not
much
going
on
for
this
beer
i
was
expecting
much
better
based
on
past
reviews
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
its
not
too
bad
but
there
are
definitely
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
decent
but
not
really
a
standout
in
the
winter
category
pours
a
very
clear
brown
colored
body
with
a
small
head
offwhite
in
color
has
a
hoppy
malty
sweet
aroma
a
dusty
light
sweet
taste
very
light
tasting
not
much
flavor
has
some
hoppiness
and
bitterness
but
not
much
flavor
this
tasted
very
good
with
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
ok
winter
warmer
nothing
terribly
exciting
there
are
better
ones
out
there
but
this
is
worth
a
try
d
a
liked
it
but
did
not
love
it
usually
would
have
only
one
unless
i
stayed
at
the
same
bar
and
didnt
have
any
other
options
i
dont
drink
winter
brews
regularly
this
time
of
year
so
im
not
the
best
judge
of
this
this
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
thick
lacing
the
aroma
carries
a
lot
of
malt
character
with
just
a
bit
of
some
noble
hops
at
the
back
the
taste
is
good
well
balanced
with
the
sweet
malt
up
front
and
the
citrus
and
spice
of
the
hop
arrangement
follow
through
nicely
a
well
balance
beer
although
i
would
have
expected
a
bit
more
in
the
way
of
alcohol
from
a
warmer
not
too
heavy
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
definitely
in
the
season
with
snow
on
the
ground
this
beer
feels
like
the
right
way
to
enjoy
the
evening
someone
else
mentioned
the
price
in
his
review
and
i
have
to
agree
for
6
99
a
sixer
this
is
a
steal
cheers
and
hoppy
holidays
taste
is
a
little
dry
with
spice
caramel
hops
and
malt
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
say
this
beer
falls
into
the
bock
catagory
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
although
the
carbonation
tends
to
make
it
a
bit
filling
this
is
an
interesting
ale
but
im
not
sure
what
its
trying
to
be
the
malt
profile
is
far
too
muted
to
be
a
winter
warmer
imho
its
closer
to
an
english
bitter
or
an
ipa
as
far
as
im
concerned
definitely
worth
a
try
though
as
long
as
youre
not
expecting
a
malty
spicy
winter
ale
d
a
great
sessioner
for
the
season
im
not
sure
if
winter
warmer
is
the
best
style
for
this
beer
to
be
listed
under
but
either
way
its
a
great
solid
beer
nothing
huge
or
bold
but
simple
and
harmonious
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
i
have
tried
lately
no
harsh
flavors
with
this
one
it
is
a
nice
smooth
drinker
dits
pretty
decent
not
a
spectacular
brew
and
i
probably
wont
chase
after
this
one
in
the
future
overall
though
still
a
nice
beer
and
with
a
wider
availability
ontap
at
restaurants
a
good
choice
when
dining
out
from
the
extra
seasonal
offering
from
the
redhook
sampler
pack
i
am
very
pleased
its
a
great
beer
ill
skip
the
usual
boring
and
repetative
review
xxx
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
red
highlights
blah
blah
blah
and
say
simply
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
sampled
in
some
time
if
you
like
your
ale
on
the
hoppy
side
not
a
big
beer
just
a
nice
fairly
low
gravity
ale
with
a
bite
and
and
6
996
pack
its
ranking
increases
in
light
of
the
exceptional
value
it
getting
tough
to
find
a
real
soild
brew
under
10
00
this
was
a
very
pleasant
discovery
and
i
will
be
buying
more
this
a
tasty
smooth
and
likable
winter
warmer
give
it
a
try
mid
body
adequate
carbonation
i
could
drink
another
sixer
this
season
very
well
done
ale
i
would
look
for
it
again
for
being
a
hoppy
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
i
cant
say
that
of
other
hoppy
beers
that
arent
ipas
i
was
very
impressed
with
my
first
exposure
to
redhook
brewery
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
copperchestnut
color
the
head
is
tan
and
creamy
nice
head
retention
and
leaves
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
beer
initial
scent
is
of
some
roasted
malts
piney
hops
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
perhaps
spices
flavor
starts
a
bit
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
caramel
and
spiciness
body
bordered
on
medium
and
it
felt
fairly
smooth
on
the
tongue
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
red
hook
i
found
it
to
be
a
nice
winter
beer
this
beer
pours
a
lovely
dark
copper
color
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
little
lace
smells
malty
with
spice
like
a
winter
warmer
should
tastes
the
same
strong
malt
flavor
followed
by
the
spices
but
not
too
spiced
like
the
widmer
brrr
winterhook
is
balanced
perfectly
very
good
beer
albeit
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
an
easy
drinking
beer
very
good
stuff
this
isnt
a
great
winter
warmer
but
swings
the
betterbalanced
redhook
esb
in
a
darker
hoppier
direction
overall
i
was
extremely
impressed
with
this
beer
very
smooth
compared
to
most
winter
warmers
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
the
pour
was
a
mild
amber
with
a
festive
white
head
the
smell
had
a
distictive
pine
scent
which
foreshadowed
the
hops
to
come
id
concur
with
the
previous
reviewer
who
suggested
this
was
one
of
the
hopiest
seasonal
ales
indeed
they
made
this
beer
as
crisp
as
the
season
it
celebrates
happy
holidays
this
ale
is
great
for
the
novice
or
the
snob
and
makes
a
great
beer
to
take
to
grandmas
house
for
christmas
dinner
for
all
to
enjoy
the
taste
is
not
nearly
as
hopped
up
as
the
nose
would
indicate
there
is
a
nice
hop
presence
but
it
is
well
balanced
with
the
bready
and
biscuity
grains
there
maybe
some
winter
type
spices
in
the
beer
such
as
nutmeg
almond
extract
allspice
and
the
like
there
is
a
slight
hop
drying
feel
in
the
mouth
towards
the
finish
the
beer
is
quite
creamy
with
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
reasonably
complex
beer
with
a
good
interplay
between
the
hops
spices
grains
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
the
hop
bite
does
extend
a
bit
into
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
glad
i
pulled
it
off
the
shelf
lchaim
bottle
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
medium
white
head
nutty
aroma
with
some
herbs
and
tea
flavor
is
smoother
than
one
would
expect
malty
and
earthy
the
taste
is
almost
like
a
lowalcohol
barleywine
its
okay
but
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
winter
brew
overall
a
solid
beer
i
would
recommend
this
winter
style
ot
anybody
d
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
given
the
generally
thin
mouthfeel
if
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
more
i
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
with
no
trouble
this
update
was
on
jan
29
2014
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
compliment
to
a
meal
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
one
drinks
by
itself
preferably
while
sitting
next
to
a
warm
fire
in
the
accompaniment
of
friends
its
definitely
one
i
would
drink
again
most
likely
on
a
special
occasion
overall
a
very
drinkable
winter
brew
perhaps
taking
its
cues
more
from
sierra
nevadas
celebration
than
the
prototypical
winter
warmer
and
should
perhaps
therefore
be
labeled
accordingly
not
as
outstanding
as
sierra
nevadas
example
but
a
solid
offering
nevertheless
not
too
bad
aromas
a
bit
hoppy
but
none
in
the
flavor
flavor
however
is
decent
with
a
ttinge
of
dryroastyness
nice
rich
dark
amber
reddish
color
light
head
that
lasts
somewhat
almost
no
lace
fairly
balanced
ok
mouthfeel
decent
finish
could
be
a
session
beer
this
beer
is
copper
in
color
hues
of
orange
with
a
solid
head
on
top
and
trickles
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
hoppy
a
clean
and
crisp
fruity
aroma
bit
of
caramel
too
the
taste
is
a
winner
pleasantly
hoppy
and
malty
good
mix
of
caramel
and
sweet
dough
to
go
with
the
grapefruit
and
piney
hop
flavors
theres
also
a
hint
of
orange
flavor
finishes
clean
a
good
drinkable
beer
overall
and
one
that
paired
well
with
my
spicy
pork
tenderloin
topped
with
bbq
sauce
d
drinks
fine
for
the
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
considering
the
many
options
i
wont
be
reaching
for
it
often
overall
a
very
good
winter
ale
will
definitely
have
this
again
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
ive
had
4
or
5
styles
of
redhook
before
and
while
they
were
good
none
really
wowed
me
this
one
certainly
did
though
this
was
just
a
delicious
hoppy
amberred
ale
great
look
in
the
glass
awesome
smell
and
taste
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
finish
man
it
went
down
way
too
quickly
for
dinner
and
im
pissed
i
only
got
a
single
ill
be
getting
a
6er
for
thanksgiving
d
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
offering
an
assertive
hop
profile
balanced
fairly
well
with
some
malts
and
spices
id
drink
this
again
and
its
a
good
option
for
the
price

notes
what
a
fine
brew
of
a
surprise
six
pack
next
time
as
it
was
so
easy
to
have
d
high
nice
session
brew
while
making
out
that
list
for
santa
pretty
hoppy
for
a
winter
warmer
more
of
a
dark
amber
ale
in
my
opinion
still
pretty
tasty
i
talked
to
a
representative
from
the
brewery
and
they
told
me
that
winterhook
was
red
hooks
experimental
beer
and
that
they
do
something
different
every
year
she
told
me
that
this
years
concoction
was
a
hoppier
version
of
years
past
with
some
different
flavors
thrown
in
so
i
did
what
any
defenseless
man
conversing
with
an
attractive
young
woman
would
do
i
took
her
advice
and
bought
a
sixpack
after
i
tried
one
she
was
right
about
the
hops
they
were
everywhere
smell
and
taste
now
im
not
complaining
but
the
supposed
other
flavors
i
couldnt
find
i
seemed
to
me
this
beer
was
nothing
more
than
a
fine
crafted
microbrew
pale
ale
with
some
roasted
malt
thrown
in
for
a
nice
dark
color
not
a
bad
choice
but
there
are
better
red
hook
beers
out
there
d
doesnt
do
it
for
me
too
hoppy
yeah
thats
right
i
said
too
hoppy
im
not
into
high
ibu
beers
at
all
more
of
a
malt
head
nice
beer
not
offensive
at
all
but
not
my
cup
of
hops
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from
redhook
with
some
nice
chewy
sweetness
but
its
the
freshness
of
the
hops
here
that
really
did
it
for
me
with
this
pint
tasty
and
pretty
easy
drinking
for
the
size
12oz
bottle
from
the
local
shaws
pours
a
translucent
dark
copper
color
with
a
good
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
fruity
spicy
hoppy
malty
carameltoffee
tastes
fruity
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
orange
zest
nut
toffee
caramel
just
a
tinge
of
butter
a
wide
plethora
of
flavors
with
the
malt
and
hops
both
playing
huge
roles
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
combines
with
the
pleasant
flavors
to
make
this
one
superdrinkable
a
new
favorite
winter
beer
lots
of
carbonation
to
go
with
a
somewhat
doughy
mouthfeel
and
lightmedium
body
nice
balanced
taste
quite
drinkable
pours
a
nice
reddish
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
slight
hops
with
some
spices
the
taste
is
malty
slight
hop
spicy
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
brew
overall
not
bad
at
all
it
is
very
mild
and
could
potentially
be
a
great
transitional
beer
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
from
redhook
id
buy
it
again
but
i
wont
be
rushing
back
there
are
betters
out
there
for
8
50
a
sixer
d
yes
this
is
very
drinkable
im
glad
i
got
this
fresh
as
well
its
a
nice
beer
drinkability
for
my
first
winter
brew
of
2008
i
was
pretty
impressed
this
is
one
is
tasty
and
rather
easy
to
gulp
down
definetley
a
sessionable
beer
for
those
holiday
parties
overall
not
disappointed
but
was
expecting
something
different
from
a
winter
beer
probably
would
not
buy
again
fan
of
the
winter
season
this
is
a
damn
good
reason
to
look
forward
to
it
d
meh
not
horrible
decent
for
a
middle
of
the
road
winter
ale
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
a
warmer
more
like
an
average
hoppy
amber
might
be
a
decent
introduction
for
someone
unfamiliar
with
the
winter
style
but
really
kind
of
middle
of
the
road
and
there
are
so
many
other
good
options
out
there
this
one
just
falls
off
the
radar
pours
a
nice
brownish
color
thin
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
hints
of
hops
and
malt
of
course
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
but
nice
not
a
roasted
malt
flavor
a
bit
more
sweet
and
the
hops
stand
right
out
a
bit
of
alcohol
bite
as
well
recommended
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
medium
head
on
a
light
amber
body
considerably
more
bitter
than
i
prefer
i
couldnt
get
anything
else
out
of
it
there
was
a
dusty
aftertaste
that
didnt
help
at
all
it
was
smooth
however
not
too
fizzy
just
not
anything
id
go
after
one
of
the
least
impressive
winter
beers
ive
ever
sampled
im
getting
a
tasty
but
unremarkable
middleoftheroad
ale
id
buy
it
again
and
drink
it
again
good
drinkability
but
i
cant
get
past
a
b
grade
on
this
one
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
pours
a
bockish
colour
with
some
retaining
head
mild
malt
and
spice
aroma
significant
hops
in
there
middling
mouthfeel
syruppy
malt
not
too
complex
symbollically
tasty
with
celery
a
bit
better
than
average
beer
though
soso
as
a
winter
warmer
pours
a
clear
amber
to
copper
with
a
small
beige
head
looks
thin
in
the
glass
smell
is
light
but
malty
and
faintly
spiced
decent
nose
taste
mild
lightly
spiced
but
not
much
so
malty
with
maybe
the
faintest
twinge
of
tartness
andor
alcohol
and
spice
actually
isnt
too
bad
for
the
style
this
beer
goes
down
well
and
the
next
went
down
well
and
so
did
the
next
one
etc
it
is
a
nice
tasting
beer
and
the
abv
isnt
very
high
i
think
is
slightly
lower
than
6
according
to
redhooks
website
i
would
drink
this
again
this
beer
pours
a
nice
orangeamber
color
with
a
nice
medium
offwhite
head
that
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
layered
with
winter
spice
smell
and
finally
a
small
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
the
taste
is
really
good
while
following
up
the
aroma
it
has
a
very
nice
sweet
roasted
malt
base
with
a
nice
amount
of
winter
spices
cinnamon
some
orange
and
a
hint
of
chocoalte
from
the
roasted
alts
the
mouthfeel
is
good
very
crisp
and
refreshing
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
overall
i
really
liked
the
flavor
but
to
describe
it
was
tough
its
a
good
winter
ale
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
rather
nice
offering
from
red
hook
i
have
had
better
sure
but
this
was
definitely
not
bad
at
all
would
i
go
out
and
buy
it
probably
not
but
i
certainly
would
not
turn
my
nose
up
at
it
either
could
have
had
a
little
more
spice
to
it
to
make
it
have
that
little
bit
of
an
extra
pop
but
overall
it
was
still
good
and
would
say
if
it
was
there
you
could
do
much
worse
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
amber
color
the
head
is
small
and
recedes
very
quickly
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
but
is
very
faint
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
annoyingly
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
extremely
pour
example
of
a
winter
warmer
and
a
bad
beer
all
around
it
isnt
bad
enough
that
i
cant
finish
one
bottle
but
i
wont
drink
this
again
drinkability
is
average
this
is
fine
and
a
bit
distinct
but
not
in
a
great
way
pours
a
shade
or
two
darker
than
orange
w
white
foam
that
recedes
fast
light
caramel
in
the
aroma
its
sweetish
in
a
cramelly
way
some
malt
the
barest
suggestion
of
chocolate
touch
of
chalk
to
the
finish
rather
lightbodied
for
a
winter
warmer
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
got
this
because
everything
else
on
tap
was
bleh
if
in
the
same
situation
recommended
d
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
it
is
a
little
lighter
than
other
winter
ales
but
that
doesnt
really
hurt
this
beer
its
worth
a
try
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
i
can
think
of
plenty
of
other
winter
warmers
i
would
rather
drink
pretty
good
pick
the
flavor
is
very
unique
with
that
subtle
streak
of
hoppy
bitterness
ive
heard
they
change
the
recipe
with
this
one
every
year
so
well
see
how
it
is
compared
to
future
offerings
i
suppose
d
i
may
be
biased
against
this
one
because
its
heavy
on
the
bitter
hops
and
light
on
the
maltiness
and
robustness
i
tend
to
enjoy
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
i
could
think
of
many
beers
i
would
dislike
more
than
this
one
i
just
wont
seek
this
one
out
overall
a
tasty
beer
from
redhook
not
your
typical
winter
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
winter
twist
worth
a
taste
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
red
hook
certainly
not
the
best
winter
beer
i
tasted
this
year
but
not
too
bad
recommended
mainly
because
it
is
so
inexpensive
12oz
brown
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
clear
goldamber
with
a
sparse
white
head
some
malt
in
the
aroma
with
a
little
of
the
trademark
redhook
diacetyl
pretty
thin
in
the
body
crisp
hop
bitterness
a
little
butteryness
and
bready
malt
decent
hop
finish
not
that
exciting
more
of
a
bland
amber
than
a
true
hearty
winter
beer
was
able
to
give
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
actually
had
a
few
back
earlier
in
december
this
brew
poured
to
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
a
good
sized
what
i
would
call
light
tan
head
that
had
ample
retention
leaving
a
nice
amount
of
lace
chunks
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
nice
malt
smell
to
it
which
really
seemed
to
have
a
toasted
property
i
would
also
say
that
caramel
shines
through
with
a
nice
slight
spice
to
it
the
taste
while
not
being
stupendous
has
a
very
good
quality
to
it
it
is
very
easy
drinking
as
the
malt
properties
lead
to
a
nice
flavor
caramel
comes
to
mind
quickly
with
a
slight
nut
flavor
seems
to
be
a
bit
dry
i
will
say
that
i
am
surprised
that
this
is
considered
a
winter
warmer
to
me
it
seems
like
a
simple
pale
ale
that
is
well
balanced
this
would
be
a
fine
session
brew
although
at
6
1
could
get
you
in
trouble
but
to
me
that
is
the
feel
of
this
one
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
a
winter
warmer
but
what
the
hell
do
i
know
d
average
across
the
board
pretty
forgettable
overall
not
bad
by
any
means
just
not
anything
to
seek
out
redhook
can
do
better
mediumbodied
and
fairly
crisp
but
when
i
think
of
a
winter
warmer
i
tend
to
think
of
something
that
will
be
well
warm
this
just
doesnt
do
it
not
quite
heavy
enough
to
do
the
trick
but
still
thick
enough
and
with
a
high
enough
abv
to
make
a
poor
session
beer
nothing
terrible
but
nothing
too
impressive
either
this
is
definitely
an
average
beer
that
i
will
probably
not
bother
to
revisit
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
well
carbonated
very
drinkable
even
sessionable
ale
but
nothing
exceptional
about
it
there
is
malt
i
think
and
the
hops
are
not
overbearing
first
brew
from
the
redhook
brewery
and
i
am
not
dissapointed
their
winter
warmer
is
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
appearance
was
a
nice
caramel
color
with
a
minimal
head
taste
was
about
average
for
a
winter
warmer
a
little
caramel
sweetness
on
the
palate
with
some
spices
present
maybe
cinnamon
but
a
little
more
bland
compared
to
some
other
winter
warmers
ive
sampled
i
was
pretty
satisfied
though
having
copped
a
single
12oz
bottle
from
wine
and
more
in
west
orange
for
about
1
79
at
6
there
was
a
nice
alcohol
glow
pervading
from
the
drink
and
the
sweetness
lingered
on
the
mouth
for
a
bit
great
drinkability
and
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
behind
a
sweet
finish
recommended
i
dont
consider
my
palette
particularly
developed
but
after
this
beer
i
think
i
understand
what
it
is
for
the
malt
to
have
a
great
relationship
with
the
hops
i
normally
wouldnt
really
see
the
winter
beer
characteristics
in
this
other
than
some
spices
that
im
picking
up
and
the
high
drinkability
but
you
can
knock
back
a
6
pack
of
these
and
feel
refreshed
and
drunk
instead
of
overwhelmed
nice
dark
copper
color
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
more
straight
out
of
the
bottle
than
in
the
glass
and
ill
be
buying
it
again
next
year
nice
dark
dark
copper
appearance
with
decent
head
gives
off
a
semisweet
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
winter
lager
i
think
i
detect
some
driedfruitlike
flavors
such
as
prunes
and
raisins
along
with
the
roasted
malt
decent
beer
maybe
im
just
not
in
the
mood
for
this
beer
right
now
or
something
but
it
doesnt
really
pique
my
interests
or
my
taste
buds
all
that
much
to
make
me
want
more
and
more
its
ok
pours
a
deep
chocolaty
opaque
brown
tan
head
has
fine
bubbles
and
persists
some
aroma
is
rich
and
creamy
and
fairly
malty
with
strong
hints
of
spice
and
coffee
flavor
is
mainly
malty
and
has
a
roast
coffee
overtone
and
hints
of
spice
and
hops
very
smooth
perfect
for
the
winter
holidays
a
nice
winter
warmer
not
as
big
as
some
other
beers
of
this
style
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
actually
that
is
what
i
like
most
about
it
the
people
at
redhook
did
not
try
to
over
do
this
beer
and
what
you
get
is
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
high
in
drinkability
flavorful
and
a
bit
complex
yet
approachable
enough
to
bring
to
a
holiday
party
by
far
its
one
of
my
favorites
each
year
this
beer
pours
into
a
typical
pint
glass
from
the
12oz
bottle
the
beer
is
goldenamber
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
small
ring
and
laces
only
a
bit
the
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
displaying
citrus
notes
and
has
a
bit
of
a
biscuity
and
breadyness
to
it
the
taste
is
almost
all
pale
malts
with
the
same
malt
profile
as
the
smell
adn
a
touch
of
hops
on
teh
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
some
lingering
syrupyness
overall
seems
more
like
an
blonde
or
an
apa
and
not
my
favorite
as
it
seams
a
bit
amatuerish
with
the
way
it
is
all
put
together
a
nice
copper
colored
ale
you
can
definitely
smell
the
malts
the
beer
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
combined
with
some
sweetness
it
has
a
nice
clean
finish
nice
balance
and
nothing
including
the
alcohol
is
overwhelming
i
give
it
high
marks
although
there
is
nothing
exceptional
in
the
taste
it
is
decent
and
the
clean
finish
leaves
you
wanting
another
swig
its
a
nice
little
sixer
to
pick
up
pours
a
clean
copper
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
sugary
fruitiness
in
the
taste
malty
and
a
very
sugary
corriander
taste
a
big
body
with
a
small
bite
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
sugary
orangeish
aftertaste
kind
of
candy
like
and
a
nice
body
im
having
this
one
at
room
temperature
it
pours
amber
with
not
much
of
a
head
i
can
smell
the
spice
in
it
but
just
barely
tastes
bitter
and
dry
slightly
spicy
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
aptly
warming
drinkable
not
very
too
dry
too
boring
not
as
good
as
the
anchor
christmas
for
sure
i
really
hope
to
find
a
6pack
off
the
winterhook
soon
or
at
least
get
three
in
a
mixed
twelve
its
a
good
winter
warmer
though
those
who
dont
want
something
so
hoppy
may
be
turned
off
a
nice
winter
warmer
for
hopheads
though
drinkability
is
very
high
a
pleasing
mild
hoppy
beer
that
is
really
enjoyable
with
each
sip
id
order
this
again
if
i
was
faced
without
stouts
on
tap
as
other
shave
mentioned
im
not
sure
why
this
is
called
a
winter
seasonal
no
spices
no
heaviness
nothing
wintery
about
it
no
matter
when
it
comes
out
though
this
isnt
bad
from
redhook
a
brewer
i
usually
skip
over
a
decent
ale
but
slightly
below
average
for
a
winter
brew
very
drinkable
but
otherwise
uneventful
nothing
really
stands
out
in
the
way
of
winter
additives
of
typical
spices
slightly
hoppy
and
bright
on
the
top
end
finishes
with
a
bit
of
zing
decent
head
and
lacing
a
very
brash
pour
caused
a
huge
2
inch
head
but
it
held
its
own
and
brought
itself
down
quick
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
definitely
not
best
in
class
go
with
cbc
winter
warmer
or
great
lakes
christmas
ale
best
in
class
d
i
wasnt
sure
where
to
score
this
in
terms
of
drinkability
if
your
measure
is
whether
it
is
exceptional
enough
that
you
would
look
forward
to
having
it
again
i
would
give
it
at
best
an
average
rating
if
you
want
to
know
is
it
good
enough
that
you
could
drink
it
all
night
without
complaints
it
is
perfectly
fine
and
i
would
give
it
at
least
a
good
rating
in
the
end
i
came
out
in
between
i
will
probably
have
this
again
and
would
pick
it
over
many
other
beers
available
but
in
the
end
it
just
isnt
special
enough
for
me
rate
it
too
much
above
average
d
this
is
a
decent
winter
ale
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
though
i
had
it
on
cask
at
the
brewery
so
that
was
cool
but
i
wouldnt
otherwise
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
d
it
was
a
decent
brew
with
a
moderate
abv
but
a
bit
more
bite
and
piny
flavors
than
i
typically
enjoy
drinks
good
makes
me
think
apa
vice
winter
warmer
but
is
still
pretty
tasty
id
take
this
over
their
ipa
or
esb
any
day
has
a
nice
copper
look
although
with
little
head
and
lacing
has
a
very
neutral
scent
just
a
bit
of
an
alehoppy
aroma
but
nothing
strong
at
all
a
nice
crisp
flavor
very
clean
that
starts
with
a
slight
hoppy
feel
and
ends
with
a
hit
of
caramel
and
what
tastes
like
a
bit
of
spice
goes
down
fine
not
rough
not
overly
smooth
a
nice
ale
but
not
the
best
winter
warmer
overall
a
tasty
beer
just
a
bit
of
a
letdown
when
i
think
of
a
winter
warmer

a
five
finger

onefinger
head
aroma
is
nice
and
spiced
taste
is
malty
upfront
with
the
spices
disappearing
in
the
back
of
the
throat
not
as
overpowering
as
other
examples
ive
had
very
smooth
like
a
pale
ale
i
supposed
it
still
qualifies
as
a
winter
warmer
but
the
spices
are
not
overpowering
like
other
examples
ive
had
light
bodied
with
average
drinkability
decent
beer
however
nothing
too
exciting
to
me
the
winterhook
comes
in
an
old
man
winter
blowing
our
way
with
a
freshness
date
of
september
17th
it
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
some
nice
foam
lacing
and
a
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
smell
alright
with
mostly
a
hoppy
aroma
dominating
it
tastes
nice
more
on
the
floral
side
with
less
of
a
maltiness
which
seems
to
be
a
norm
for
this
style
it
has
a
nice
caramel
flavor
to
it
and
it
is
light
and
soft
in
the
mouth
respect
the
old
dog
on
the
block
this
beer
goes
down
well
i
find
myself
detecting
new
flavors
with
each
sip
the
folks
at
esb
have
made
this
year
after
year
since
1985
with
good
reason
it
is
a
deliciously
drinkable
beverage
it
will
not
knockout
bells
winter
wheat
as
my
favorite
winter
beer
but
i
will
enjoy
this
6pack
and
maybe
another
an
ok
winter
warmer
and
nothing
more
if
i
want
a
good
version
of
the
style
i
would
get
2
below
or
an
alaskan
winter
ale
this
beer
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
thick
head

light
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
malt
with
a
slight
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
spicy
and
hoppy
with
a
nice
malt
background
the
mouthfeel
is
full
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
id
consider
easy
to
drink
drinkability
im
not
crazy
about
bitter
beer
someone
who
likes
hops
would
like
this
a
nice
ale
bracing
and
crisp
d
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
an
everyday
one
for
me
this
is
one
of
the
better
redhooks
sad
definetely
a
warmer
but
probably
the
hoppiest
warmer
ive
ever
had
this
isnt
to
say
that
its
hoppy
on
a
grand
scale
just
that
warmers
usually
dont
have
any
hop
presence
at
all
this
is
nice
change
of
pace
and
that
fact
that
its
free
of
the
usually
burny
warmer
aftertaste
which
often
contrasts
poorly
against
sweet
malts
is
a
good
thing

overall
supposedly
they
use
nine

which
is
great
but
they
need
a
lot
more
of
it

not
getting

of

falls
into

on

focuses
on

the

is
good
a
decent
session
brew
d
i
dont
really
know
what
else
to
say
i
had
the
esb
and
ipa
and
while
not
spectacular
they
werent
downright
bad
like
the
winter
warmer
at
first
i
thought
it
was
a
bad
bottle
but
even
after
letting
it
sit
for
awhile
my
opinion
changed
not
its
one
of
those
that
was
so
bad
i
want
to
try
it
again
just
to
be
sure
this
beer
had
a
very
similar
smell
of
banana
and
sweet
malt
that
their
blonde
has
and
furthermore
the
mouthfeel
is
very
similar
obviously
they
are
different
colors
with
the
winter
warmer
being
much
darker
but
kinda
wierd
d
although
i
was
happy
with
it
i
do
have
many
more
to
try
this
winter
and
i
would
not
be
disappointed
if
i
didnt
have
it
again
until
next
year
overall
a
faint
shell
of
what
this
ale
used
to
be
from
68
years
ago
not
malty
at
all
just
a
nice
dose
of
hops
for
its
saving
grace
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
copper
colored
with
an
offwhite
head
that
leaves
trails
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
mostly
of
sugary
malt
and
spices
and
only
very
slightly
of
grassy
hops
maybe
a
slight
citrus
tang
taste
is
initially
sweet
and
spicy
like
the
nose
but
has
a
fairly
bitter
dry
finish
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
creamy
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
winter
warmer
and
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
not
a
favorite
but
pretty
good
and
worth
trying
pours
out
just
plain
brown
in
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
was
light
with
hints
of
mossy
pine
not
much
else
the
flavor
wasnt
very
sweet
mostly
it
tasted
fresh
soapy
and
hoppy
the
carbonation
was
slightly
irritating
in
the
mouth
but
not
bad
it
went
down
pretty
easy
but
mostly
this
brew
was
nothing
special
nothing
below
average
either
but
it
didnt
thrill
me
i
probably
wont
drink
it
again
taste
is
well
balanced
with
maltsweetness
and
bitterness
but
no
real
richness
of
flavor
this
is
creamier
that
some
of
the
other
massproduced
winter
offerings
slight
clove
character
respectable
offering
medium
mouthfeelslightly
cheweya
bit
harsh
going
down
average
beer
not
excitingcouldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
be
quite
content
this
one
really
took
me
by
surprise
i
was
expecting
a
weak
offering
and
while
its
definitely
not
the
usual
winter
warmer
its
still
a
nice
good
beer
a
really
nice
winter
ale
perfect
with
a
holiday
dinner
or
a
cold
night
beside
the
fire
enjoy
it
at
cellar
temperature
to
get
the
most
out
of
its
varied
flavors
the
current
bottled
version
has
a
nice
seemingly
dryhopped
bite
to
it
but
on
the
other
hand
theres
also
an
unpleasant
metallic
taste
id
still
call
this
an
improvement
overall
i
wouldnt
have
minded
having
another
drinkability
was
good
pleasant
and
recommended
though
not
as
complex
as
other
winter
styles
this
is
an
old
faithful
if
your
bar
doesnt
offer
anything
too
interesting
this
is
always
a
good
call
i
like
to
pair
this
one
up
with
a
nice
side
of
rye
to
get
me
through
the
cold
weather
it
matches
nicely
d
a
very
good
overall
drinkable
winter
brew
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
good
the
drinkability
is
not
so
great
as
the
spicy
after
taste
lingers
too
long
rather
move
forward
from
the
beer
than
back
to
it
so
many
other
options
out
there
i
dont
see
myself
wanting
another
one
of
these
drinkability
something
to
keep
in
mind
there
are
many
far
better
winter

pours
transparent

lots
of
lacing

aroma
is
citrus
lots
of
cascades
citrusy
hops
dominate
the
flavor
malts
are
there
but
this
seems
way
out
of
balance
the
mouthfeel
seems
quite
thin
this
is
ok
but
it
just
seems
to
be
hop
water
overall
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
redhook
stuff
that
being
said
this
beer
is
good
i
was
surprized
when
i
had
it
for
the
first
time
i
might
even
buy
it
again
pours
a
dark
brownish
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
ring
of
lace
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
dominated
by
fresh
hops
with
a
faint
sweet
malt
background
and
maybe
even
some
winter
spices
after
the
really
nice
aroma
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
the
lack
of
flavor
the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
hops
upfront
with
a
sweet
and
toasted
malt
presence
as
well
pretty
good
tasting
brew
but
it
is
just
a
little
too
watered
down
overall
this
is
an
interesting
enough
seasonal
to
have
again
but
really
nothing
to
get
exited
over
pours
red
brown
with
a
puffy
tope
head
smells
of
cloves
hops
and
some
dry
citrus
rind
odors
quite
a
spicy
nose
and
reasonably
intriguing
taste
is
sweet
and
effervescent
tastes
like
cloves
and
sweet
malt
hops
are
cloying
and
floral
somewhat
unbalanced
between
malt
and
hops
some
menthollike
flavor
in
there
too
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
for
it
being
a
winter
warmer
drinks
ok
but
really
not
anything
special
for
the
style
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
bright
amber
color
with
some
carbonation
medium
offwhite
head
that
lingered
a
while
and
left
okay
lacing
i
detected
the
aroma
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
though
not
real
strongly
similar
to
an
ipa
however
the
taste
had
more
of
the
spicy
wheat
flavor
of
a
hefeweizen
thle
palate
was
somewhat
spicy
and
the
finish
a
mix
between
drybitter
and
stale
it
was
alomost
like
redhook
mixed
two
different
styles
this
was
a
very
strange
beer
although
not
too
bad
overall
hardly
your
typical
seasonal
winter
brew
though
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
great
on
a
cold
snowy
night
d
not
too
bad
id
drink
it
again
a
very
clean
and
simple
beer
a
perfect
session
winter
ale
no
fancy
spices
no
super
hops
just
well
balanced
and
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
a
little
disappointing
but
not
entirely
bad
just
not
what
id
expect
from
redhook
or
from
a
winter
warmer
d
not
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
beers
flavors
are
sort
of
herky
jerky
and
dont
meld
well
drinkability
this
winter
warmer
is
quite
drinkable
and
appropriate
for
the
holidays
and
has
a
pleasant
flavor
its
just
not
quite
up
there
with
others
that
ive
tried
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
though
before
i
typed
this
i
found
several
listings
for
a
redhook
brew
by
this
name
and
sure
enough
there
have
been
changes
the
darker
and
more
robust
offering
i
remember
enjoying
for
a
handful
of
years
more
akin
to
their
blackhook
porter
in
heft
and
mouthfeel
seems
to
have
been
retired
along
with
the
old
stubby
bottles
but
i
enjoy
this
new
recipe
just
the
same
for
my
money
winterhook
is
still
the
best
offering
from
redhook
too
bad
it
isnt
a
year
round
offering
d
not
too
strong
good
for
whenever
id
say
it
isnt
wonderful
but
id
say
it
is
one
of
the
best
winter
beers
ive
had
this
season
much
much
better
than
that
samual
adams
winter
lager
crap
i
had
last
week
the
beer
poured
copper
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
hops
and
a
bit
of
spice
the
taste
was
a
lightly
spiced
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
feel
was
basically
dry
this
was
a
pretty
average
beer
and
not
at
all
up
to
the
basic
expectations
of
a
winter
warmer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
murky
mahogany
color
with
some
reddish
tinge
to
it
slightly
vigorous
pour

a
thin

that
quickly
fades
away
to
a
light

hoppy
and
of
sweet
caramel
malts
very
light
on
the
nose
slightly
grainy
as
well
taste
starts
out
hoppy
and
slightly
bitter
similar
to
an

then
transforms
into
a
sweet
and
malty
finish
with
a
light
bittering
dry
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
levels
goes
down
smooth
easy
to
drink
decent
brew
although
a
far
cry
from
the

the
hoppiness
is

actually
appreciated
the
lighter
flavor
as

to
how
heavy
on
the

that

can

id
go
with
several

before

not
very

good
lacing
the
smell
is
strong
of

with

and
smoke
the
taste
is
more
hops
but
with
more
of
a
malt
presence
giving
it
some
balance
it
finishes
clean
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
a
spice
pretty
dry

no
hardly
any

off
great
change
the
yeast
and
get
rid
of
the
harsh
finish
and
it
would
be
a
really
good
beer
as
it
is
similar
to
dried
blood
dark
amber
almost
copper
in
color
with
a
frothy
head
and
a
nice
lace
effect
the
smell
is
frity
kind
of
citrusy
very
aromatic
hops
were
used
in
the
making
of
this
beer
i
also
get
a
fruity
taste
very
hoppy
and
malted
nicely
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
several
years
ago
this
ale
was
much
richer
and
full
bodied
seriously
this
is
the
worst
winter
ale
ive
had
this
year
for
all
the
reasons
ive
stated
above
i
usually
give
a
more
detailed
review
but
this
beer
is
just
not
worthy
starts
out
quite
promising
pouring
a
dark
copper
with
a
substantial
foamy
head
smells
pretty
nice
also
unfortunately
rather
thin
and
mild
particularly
for
the
style
some
hop
bitterness
and
nothing
negative
about
the
flavor
just
too
small
for
a
seasonal
would
be
a
decent
ipa
dark
amber
hue
with
a
thin
ring
of
a
head
some
fresh
winter
spices
and
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
make
for
an
inviting
beverage
a
bit
thin
up
front
but
quite
tasty
roasted
malts
winter
spices
some
orange
peel
and
lemon
notes
as
she
warms
some
of
the
hop
flavorings
become
more
noticeable
delicate
and
smooth
a
strong
oldale
probably
not
but
one
of
the
underrated
and
widely
available
winter
beverages
a
great
offering
and
a
superb
winter
session
brew
a
good
offering
from
redhook
id
drink
this
again
notes
not
too
much
in
this
one
to
make
me
think
of
this
as
a
winter
brew
its
probably
the
best
redhook
beer
ive
had
but
its
more
of
a
regular
amber
beer
than
a
winter
brew
not
one
that
id
rush
out
to
buy
each
year
to
see
how
its
changed
pours
a
deep
red
amber
with
a
big
llasting
acey
offwhite
head
sweet
on
the
malts
and
light
on
the
hops
the
balance
is
spot
on
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
the
strength
barely
shows
through
certainly
amoung
the
better
beers
by
redhook
not
over
the
top
in
flavor
but
very
eaasy
to
drink
very
different
from
what
i
remember
but
very
good
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
medium
bodied
winterhook
is
a
decent
beer
that
seemed
to
be
a
bit
too
offbalance
to
be
truly
enjoyable
surprised
to
see
this
is
an
old
ale
tastes
more
like
an
amber
still
on
its
own
its
a
good
if
uneventful
beer
and
one
i
might
consider
having
in
the
future
winterhook
is
just
an
average
beer
with
a
good
smell
deep
clear
crimson
in
color
medium
sized
creamy
and
dense
boned
white
head
retention
is
good
and
lacing
is
nice
this
beer
has
got
a
bit
of
that
dry
hopped
west
coast
hop
aroma
that
i
love
piney
citrusy
and
grapefruity
there
is
also
some
slight
maltiness
noted
on
the
nose
while
there
is
a
caramel
malt
presence
noted
this
years
edition
has
more
of
a
west
coast
hop
presence
the
flavor
and
bitterness
grapefruity
and
piney
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
body
about
medium
full
yeah
this
is
an
improvement
over
the
last
few
years
but
its
still
not
one
im
gonna
run
out
and
buy
a
12
pack
of
every
year
this
beer
pours
a
dark
shade
of
brown
with
a
nice
head
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
malty
with
caramel
and
some
spice
the
flavor
reminded
me
a
lot
of
anchor
steam
with
just
a
little
more
strength
in
the
flavor
malty
and
hoppy
with
caramel
and
spices
good
winter
beer
the
new
winterhook
pours
out
a
deep
and
dark
ruby
and
amber
colour
a
thin
fine
head
reduces
to
wisps
of
lace
gotta
love
the
souped
up
hop
aroma
very
pine
and
resin
like
very
appealing
the
taste
of
this
new
worked
over
winterhook
is
hop
heavy
with
a
syrupy
caramel
malt
base
this
is
such
a
huge
improvement
over
the
previous
robust
version
that
its
hard
not
to
get
a
little
excited
i
really
disliked
old
winterhook
but
i
really
like
this
stuff
the
hop
taste
comes
off
as
piney
maybe
dry
hopped
more
evergreen
than
citrus
more
flavourful
than
bitter
the
malt
base
is
a
bit
sweet
and
syrupy
such
as
years
past
but
with
addition
of
the
new
hop
profile
its
not
so
offending
and
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
seem
so
slick
there
seems
to
be
a
hint
of
spiciness
too
i
applaud
the
major
tweaks
to
the
winterhook
profile
not
too
bad
a
tawny
amber
body
lying
under
a
cloud
of
ivory
foam
the
head
lasted
and
laced
decenlty
the
nose
was
mostly
malty
with
pulpy
fruit
notes
and
a
bit
of
spicy
hop
notes
flavors
are
mostly
of
a
fruity
malt
variety
with
a
decent
medium
body
and
a
creamy
sense
good
drinkability
from
this
nice
light
old
ale
auburnbronze
hue
clear
and
brilliant
the
color
is
very
appealing
unfortunately
the
head
developed
poorly
there
was
little
more
than
dishwater
bubbles
that
covered
half
of
the
bare
beer
a
very
small
amount
of
disorganized
specks
of
lace
dotted
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
immediately
the
nose
tells
me
two
things
this
is
hoppy
and
this
is
not
the
winterhook
of
last
years
im
rather
pleased
with
the
pine
aromas
undercurrents
of
floral
and
distant
hints
of
maltiness
at
the
back
the
bouquet
has
a
couple
layers
of
depth
and
a
distinct
invitation
to
quaff
the
palate
is
bitter
upfront
from
the
piney
hops
a
smidge
of
floral
follows
the
maltiness
is
a
little
lacking
and
ordinary
traces
of
caramel
but
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
a
little
ale
fruitiness
is
interwoven
the
finish
is
mildly
hoppy
with
a
pleasant
piney
aftertaste
some
direct
bitterness
unexpectedly
moreish
and
surprisingly
tasty
especially
considering
redhook
does
not
wow
me
i
even
got
hop
burps
medium
in
body
a
touch
thin
more
malt
would
help
the
carbonation
is
a
little
low
but
tolerable
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
to
quaff
as
well
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
have
a
few
at
a
time
if
redhook
sticks
with
this
recipe
then
the
new
and
improved
winterhook
will
be
a
staple
in
my
refrigerator
when
winter
rolls
around
sixpacks
are
too
damn
cheap
for
you
not
to
try
i
got
mine
for
5
50
in
omaha
nice
enough
cheap
winter
sessional
like
a
poormans
sn
celebration
ale
which
is
probably
exactly
what
it
was
meant
to
be
supposedly
an
improvement
over
years
past
but
i
dont
remember
if
i
ever
had
the
old
version
this
one
is
certainly
good
and
the
best
redhook
ive
had
bar
the
late
lamented
rye
beer
not
to
be
confused
with
that
yellow
swillish
sunrye
dark
ruby
with
medium
head
and
adequate
lacing
malts
are
sweet
and
fruity
some
light
elements
of
berries
and
lots
of
caramel
buttery
hops
are
faint
and
mostly
in
the
piney
spicy
aroma
i
had
a
sixpack
that
was
just
days
off
the
bottling
line
and
it
was
remarkable
this
is
a
couple
weeks
older
and
not
quite
as
good
a
fine
winter
warmer
maybe
could
do
with
a
touch
more
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
drinkable
winter
beer
that
is
very
good
i
had
pretty
low
expectations
going
into
this
tasing
and
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
the
result
this
would
not
be
my
first
choice
but
it
is
certainly
worth
the
effort
mahogany
color
with
a
brown
receding
head
low
aroma
of
sweet
malt
belies
the
full
flavor
jumping
out
of
this
beer
sweet
malt
flavor
yes
but
surprisingly
hoppy
smooth
floral
hops
not
biting
with
definite
hints
of
citrus
and
pine
the
finish
is
adorned
with
spicey
flavors
including
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
very
enjoyable
beer
this
has
a
nice
little
hop
bite
to
its
initial
taste
but
then
turns
to
malty
its
color
was
a
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
the
head
was
frothy
but
then
went
down
to
a
laceing
of
the
same
color
i
was
most
inpressed
with
the
cover
up
of
the
higher
alcohol
in
this
brew
i
would
have
never
guessed
that
it
was
almost
7
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
on
the
first
taste
but
smooths
out
as
you
go
excellent
looking
and
an
eye
pleasing
beer
with
a
clear
and
bright
light
garnet
color
with
tinges
of
orange
small
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
with
more
of
it
coming
out
as
the
beer
warmed
up
along
with
sweet
and
grassy
hops
aromas
included
sweet
cherries
apricots
and
birch
the
beer
is
a
dry
one
light
in
malt
body
with
a
biting
and
bitter
tang
and
a
dry
fruity
finish
light
tasty
and
flavorful
the
dryness
is
an
asset
to
this
beer

initially
in

superceded
by
assertive

bitterness
and
sharp

of

mellows
quickly
with
stately
butterscotch
and

notes
contrasting
the
barbed

character
understated
hints
of
tart

surface
late
along
with
breezy

dry
cocoa
lending
dessert
like
qualities
soft
on
the
palate
and
perhaps
a
touch
lean

to
complement
the
malt
backbone
finishes
both
buttery
and
burnt
with
lingering

tones
a
flavorful
albeit
raw
brew
with
a

its
a

and
an
enjoyable
brew
not
sure
id
necessarily
seek
it
out
on
a
regular
basis
to
purchase
but
id
consider
ordering
it
if
it
were
on
tap
at
the
place
i
was
at
appearance
is
deep
copper
thats
clear
and
clean
well
displayed
head
that
settled
slowly
a
nice

aroma
with
a
presence
of
fruitsmaltnuts
and
a
bit
of
spruce
i
was
expecting
more
of
theses
same
flavors
in
the
taste
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
little
underpowered
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
as
well
all
in
all
a
nice
tame
seasonal
thats
worth
a
try
it
had
been
years
since
i
had
a
winterhook
and
i
dont
recall
at
all
what
it
tasted
like
and
if
i
liked
it
or
not
i
enjoyed
this
one
though
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
will
be
picking
up
again
this
season
clear

i
like
in
a
winter
brew
fairly

spicy
hops
are
assertive
balsamic
and
slightly
dry

helping
the
finish
markedly

seems
more
viscous
than
previous
years
id
give
it

id
say
that

are
improved

that

overall
impression
4
easy
drinking
winter
ale
good
pure
flavors
hops
and
malt
doing
their
thing
its
very
clean
and
neat
but
not
a
lot
of
punch
for
the
winter
season
still
a
very
well
crafted
beer
appearance
ruby
tinted
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
leaving
lacing
around
my
glass
fine
but
hey
its
there
aromatics
the
cascades
weigh
in
nicely
here
upfront
floral
and
piney
not
bad
not
a
lot
of
malt
sweetness
but
definitely
not
bad
the
hops
are
nice
flavor
is
definitely
tame
low
pur
of
caramel
malt
tones
slightly
spiced
not
bad
at
all
with
what
i
was
expecting
to
be
a
roaring
hop
profile
was
nothing
at
all
just
a
mild
finish
of
hops
disappointing
but
i
was
expecting
much
mouthfeel
thin
not
much
texture
lacks
body
smooth
carbonation
for
a
winter
seasonal
this
is
a
light
beer
drinkability
is
mediocre
cant
picture
myself
buying
this
ever
again
i
remember
a
day
sigh
has
a
pretty
medium
copper
color
after
poured
into
a
pint
glass
little
head
retention
but
nice
lacing
that
hangs
around
pleasant
nose
is
a
bit
complex
but
dominated
by
malt
sweetness
hops
and
a
hint
of
woodsy
spices
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
definitely
crisp
with
hops
i
swear
that
there
are
some
kind
of
spices
trying
to
reach
out
and
bite
your
tongue
dry
aftertaste
and
definitely
a
belly
warmer
above
average
for
a
seasonal
ale
this
ale
is
a
bit
beyond
medium
but
not
quite
full
bodied
there
is
also
a
certain
density
to
the
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
a
pretty
easy
drinker
but
not
what
i
would
call
a
session
beer
it
is
more
of
a
slow
end
of
the
evening
ale
this
beer
is
a
deep
deep
ruby
color
it
is
very
clear
and
pours
with
a
tan
head
at
first
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
then
the
hops
kick
in
a
bit
the
hops
come
to
dominate
the
aroma
but
they
are
not
super
strong
either
the
first
taste
is
lightly
fruity
hints
of
cherry
the
finish
is
off
dry
and
is
accompanied
by
a
hoppiness
that
is
complimentary
to
the
fruit
flavors
no
real
strong
flavors
that
jump
out
at
me
the
hops
are
the
dominant
flavor
here
but
for
some
reason
this
beer
tastes
a
tad
on
the
weak
side
not
my
favorite
winter
beer
lacks
the
richness
and
complexity
of
most
but
is
still
better
than
in
previous
years

some

through
in
the
finish

with
a

not
bad
for
redhook
i
was
expecting
something
lack
luster
but
the
late
kick
this
has
kept
me
intrigued
update
the
2009
vintage
has
now
extended
the
pattern
this
beer
has
nice
flavors
and
actually
looks
pretty
cool
but
lacks
a
strong
body
the
beer
pours
a
limpid
deep
garnet
color
the
head
impressive
in
size
the
color
a
light
tan
frothy
in

it

a

the

the
top
skeletal

finish
is
striking
in
its
acidity
the
hops
indifferent
in
their
spiciness
very
dry
and
lingering
aftertaste
drinkable
beer
but
is
a
bit
thinwaisted
for
me
to
give
it
much
credit
tastes
though
it
was
stronger
than
5
58
but
the
waitress
had
no
idea
o
this
one
surprised
me
in
a
good
way
although
the
aroma
was
a
bit
weak
the
taste
was
nice
as
the
vanilla
toffee
and
caramel
tastes
mixed
well
together
i
would
buy
this
again
but
definitely
for
the
winter
while
its
cold
and
not
during
the
warm
spring
as
it
is
now
great
flavor
but
not
to
overpowering
nice
spicy
flavor
very
drinkable
a
decent
winter
ale
solid
brew
drinkable
amazing
seasonal
beer
i
try
to
get
it
every
year
great
flavor
and
smell
love
the
malt
my
friend
mike
sondel
recommended
this
mike
has
the
taste
buds
of
a
hammer
why
do
i
listen
to
him
this
is
another
beer
i
repeatedly
get
and
dont
like
it
tastes
metallic
and
odd
to
me
but
enough
of
the
positives
note
to
self
dont
order
this
and
get
new
friends
not
a
bad
spiced
ale
vanilla
cinnamon
yet
still
a
malty
sweetness
not
really
a

very
attractive
with
gorgeous

definitely
become
a

a

note
for

soft

and
a

on

sweet

well
balanced
on

did
not
agree
with
me
after
taste
typically
not
a
fan
of
spiced
beers
aroma

has
spicy

delish
i
loved
it
very
smooth
and
good
o
extremely
enjoyable
beer
always
one
of
my
winter
favorites
decent
winter
warmer
style
ale
the
spices
are
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
here
and
there
is
a
sugar
spice
feel
that
can
be
a
little
overwhelming
definitely
a
solid
body
and
high
maltiness
here
drinkable
but
just
an
average
winter
ale
extremely
light
on
the
nose
lightly
spiced
s
apple
juice
caramel
best
seasonal
ale
of
the
year
for
me
just
awight
taste
kind
of
lingers
not
great
but
ill
finish
the
two
singles
i
bought
why
does
the
review
say
option
then
require
me
to
write
something
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
plain
simple
really
good
slightly
spiced
ale
the
creamy
head
disappeared
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
nose
did
not
match
the
full
flavor
if
there
is
a
down
side
it
would
be
a
lack
of
body
there
was
some
but
for
a
winter
brew
id
like
something
substantial
when
all
is
said
done
i
look
forward
to
next
winter
bottle
at
christmas
in
offaly
ireland
i
like
it
nicely
spiced
but
not
too
heavy
o
a
pleasant
winter
warmer
with
an
even
more
pleasant
price
tag
will
in
all
likelihood
be
getting
this
again
a
very
pleasant
easy
to
drink
winter
warmer
not
overly
seasonal
with
all
the
fruit
and
spice
that
belong
in
my
holiday
pies
i
could
easily
sip
a
couple
of
these
i
will
be
buying
more
poured
cold
from
a
12oz
can
into
a
pub
glass
full
2
fingers
of
head
that
linger
golden
copper
hue
sniff
fruit
citrus
unidentifiable
spices
sugar
guessing
caramel
taste
citrus
hops
and
seasonal
spices
like
a
hint
of
pumpkin
pie
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
but
very
light
little
hidden
bitterness
as
it
goes
down
very
drinkable
could
throw
a
6
pack
back
and
take
a
long
winters
nap
like
it
a
lot
pours
a
barely
clouded
copper
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
settles
down
to
almost
nothing
the
aroma
malty
and
light
with
hints
of
caramel
and
some
light
spice
notes
the
flavor
is
nice
and
close
to
the
taste
notes
with
hints
of
toffee
fruits
spices
and
caramel
its
not
a
huge
amount
of
any
one
flavor
and
not
particularly
deep
but
all
together
it
is
quite
enjoyable
the
body
has
a
nice
weight
to
it
and
a
nice
smooth
finish
this
beer
is
heavy
enough
to
be
a
winter
but
very
easy
to
drink
as
well
this
could
use
a
little
more
punch
but
its
very
drinkable
not
quite
a
4star
beer

beer
all

flat
out
disappointed
overly
sweet
with
a
relatively
onedimensional

profile
the
mouthfeel
just
doesnt

and
the
flavors
the
come
through
are
just
confusing
and
dont
realy
work
together
fairly
weak
and
with
all
of
the
other
winter
seasonals
out
there
i
cant
really
see
much
of
a
draw
for
this
one
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
mug
had
this
after
having
sierras
celebration
wow
what
a
contrast
poured
a
med
amber
with
a
12
light
tan
head
that
reduced
rather
quickly
aroma
of
toasted
malt
with
overtures
of
nutmeg
and
fresh
bread
a
rich
and
flavorful
beer
with
very
little
hop
presence
of
course
after
a
sierra
nothing
has
a
hop
presence
unless
your
chewing
on
one
even
with
the
high
alcohol
level
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
a
very
pleasant
brew
d
didnt
find
the
flavoring
all
that
intriquing
or
enough
to
hold
my
attention
beyond
the
first
few
sips
a
drink
that
quickly
gets
mundane
and
cant
imagine
drinking
or
enjoying
this
in
multiples
overall
impression
not
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
but
its
got
some
interesting
flavors
and
is
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
drinkability
is
pretty
strong
a
good
brew
for
the
winter
months
another
christmas
beer
that
is
too
sweet
overal
imo
a
few
more
bitter
hops
would
be
nice
final
thought
its
definitely
a
fun
beer
that
has
many
of
the
christmas
flavors
one
would
expect
its
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
but
fairly
onedimensional
and
not
too
exciting
d
very
drinkable
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
might
even
be
my
christmas
evening
beer
a
decent
winter
warmer
a
bit
mild
compared
to
other
winter
seasonal
ales
the
color
was
a
hazy
medium
dark
amber
with
a
little
white
foam
that
disapated
within
a
few
seconds
the
smell
of
spices
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
smooth
aroma
the
taste
was
of
spices
and
a
touch
of
a
sour
candy
on
the
palate
a
nice
finish
to
this
winter
warmer
pleasant
tasting
not
to
sweet
or
sour
a
nice
balance
of
all
component
too
light
and
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
to
be
a
real
winter
warmer
easy
to
drink
especially
if
you
like
creme
soda
mouth
is
medium
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
drinks
easy
but
i
think
it
drinks
too
easy
for
this
style
just
ok
but
id
never
think
of
buying
this

in

pint
poured
a
dark
gold
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
lots
of
malt
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
spice
that
i
had
a
hard
time
placing
lots
of
vanilla
in
the
flavor
medium
bodied
with
a
rich
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
malt
and
vanilla
dominate
this
beer
might
not
be
for
everyone
but
i
thought
this
was
very
interesting
the
taste
is
better
than
id
have
expected
not
flat
nice
little
bite
nose
of
spice
ahh
what
i
remember
it
really
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
im
hopeful
that
the
remaining

have
a
bit
more
life
would
def
have
another
could
prolly
see
purchasing
a

drinkable
now
and
in

if

its

its

with
the

im
at

loss
to
precisely
identify
the
constituents
added
to
this
fine
beer
im
not
sure
about
the
mouthfeel
category
in
general
as
most
quality
beers
seem
silky
to
me
and
the
anderson
valley
winter
solstice
2006
is
no
different
my
inclination
is
to
only
highlight
mouthfeel
when
i
notice
something
unusual
one
way
or
the
other
a

very

seasonal
gotta
say
if
youre
expecting
a
traditional
winter
warmer
style
beer
before
taking
your
first
sip
of
this
beer
you
are
in
for
a
bit
of

this
was
sold

round
as
a

i
wouldnt
be

brews
this

for

from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
wine
world

spirits
in

is
a

all
the
wayand
a
good
one
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
sweet
spiced
winter
warmers
the
bitter
chocolate
makes
this
beer
so
good
it
has
a
good
complexity
and
its
a
unique
experience
o
an
easy
drinking
roasty
winter
warmer
fairly
standard
but
a
good
flavor
set
that
hints
at
the
porter
style
overall
a
solid
winter
warmer
that
i
could
see
enjoying
w
a
big
cheeseburger
or
maybe
a
pot
roast
o
this
becomes
pretty
sweet
after
a
while
so
it
might
not
be
a
bad
idea
to
have
someone
on
standby
to
share
this
with
still
if
were
talking
about
how
this
one
lives
up
to
the
basic
definition
of
the
winter
warmer
moniker
meaning
does
it
lift
the
soul
and
warm
the
orifices
id
say
its
a
success
id
buy
it
again

that
could
turn
into
something
brilliant
with
the
addition
of
barrel
aging
ill
have
to
try
and
track
one
of
the
ba
versions
down
wintertime
was
late
such
a
perfect
time
to
pop
the
cap
on
this
bottle
abominable
is
true
to
style
with
an
alluring
dark
color
and
a
palate
that
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
a
brawny
ale
one
that
looks
to
warm
the
soul
and
ward
off
any
winter
chill
which
it
does
not
seem
to
have
a
problem
doing
o
a
really
solid
winter
warmer
great
flavor
profile
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
8
and
the
bold
flavors
it
imparts
nitro
did
it
wonders
but
have
also
had
it
on
tap
no
on
nitro
and
like
it
just
as
much
overall
a
very
drinkable
ale
i
make
it
as
much
a
traditional
coffee
stout
as
a
winter
ale
but
very
good
indeed
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
take
on
what
i
feel
like
can
be
a
very
broad
style
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
winter
beer
its
certainly
one
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
the
profile
for
this
beer
says
its
7
5
but
the
can
that
im
looking
at
2012
batch
says
this
winter
monster
clocks
in
at
8
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
abominable
definitely
gets
more
complex
and
enjoyable
as
it
warms
dont
pass
this
beer
up
if
you
see
it
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
when
i
think
winter
warmer
i
imagine
some
red
or
ruby
hues
this
looks
like
a
porter
or
stout
nice
34
inch
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
not
much
of
a
nose
on
this
faint
roasted
grain
maybe
a
hint
of
raisin
the
taste
is
good
not
great
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
sure
very
slight
roasty
flavor
bit
of
sweetness
again
that
hint
of
raisin
really
smooth
and
balanced
hops
are
nowhere
to
be
found
they
are
in
there
because
it
is
really
well
balanced
but
nothing
really
shines
flavor
wise
i
like
this
beer
more
than
my
review
reflects
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
cold
winter
day
however
i
think
when
you
slap
winter
warmeron
it
you
expect
certain
flavors
to
be
bolder
this
cost
5
and
change
for
a
bomber
at
full
throttle
bottles
really
good
price
for
this
beer
o
its
quite
good
its
big
brother
bourbon
abominable
is
in
a
different
class
on
its
own
but
i
can
see
why
this
beer
would
make
a
great
base
beer
for
bourbon
aging
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
sheet
of
tan
foam
and
a
spotty
leftover
of
lace
nose
is
lots
of
caramel
toffee
tawny
character
surprised
given
the
srm
here
i
like
the
sweet
nose
on
this
one
flavor
is
sharply
dry
with
malts
and
hints
of
sweetness
and
a
molasses
character
the
malts
have
oxidized
slightly
over
the
year
and
have
developed
a
woody
character
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
nice
beer

a

with

little
aroma
flavor
is
immediately
spicy
ingredients
down
dirty
claim
no
additives
so
the
spice
must
be
all
in
the

otherwise
i
might
have
guessed
cloves

the

of
the
flavor
8
0
abv
based
on
this
years
label
doesnt
hurt
either
theres
a
malt
backbone
to
thing
thing
as
well
but
flavorwise
its
lost
here
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
thanks
to
wellmoderated
carbonation
but
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
one
dimensional
bitterness
verdict
not
my
favorite
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
with
some
nice
cream
notes
mixed
in
as
well
the
flavor
is
similar
the
beer
is
very
chocolatey
tasting
and
there
is
also
a
nice
amount
of
roasted
malt
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
mint
in
the
flavor
which
goes
well
with
the
other
flavors
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
bomber
from
malt
and

poured
a
clear
dark
reddish

with
a
small
lasting
brown
head
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
carmel
light
vanilla
light
earthiness
and
a
hint
of

flavors
of
dark
chocolate
roasted

light
carmel
light
coffee
and
a
hint
of
spice
with
a
smooth
dry
lingeing
chocolate
finish
really
liked
this
and
it
got
better
throughout
the
time
i
spent
with
it
overall
a
very
nice
beer
especially
for
a
winter
warmer
i
remember
a
little
spice
the
last
time
i
had
it
but
not
getting
much
this
time
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
pours
a
very
heave
amber
holding
up
a
soft
brown
head
and
leaving
nice
ringed
lace
smell
of
dark
rich
roasted
malt
coffee
dried
plums
taste
is
rich
with
the
roasted
malt
coffee
and
dark
fruits
having
a
nice
balance
with
the
mild
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
with
mild
carbonation
making
it
go
down
smooth
a
tasty
rich
dark
winter
ale
with
subtle
alchohol
on
the
senses
that
goes
down
well
on
a
cold
night
all
4s
really
solid
winter
ale
goes
really
easy
on
the
spice
and
brings
on
some
big
malts
easy
drinking
o
suitable
for
a
winter
ale
it
could
use
a
bit
more
spice
overall
ok
not
my
favorite
fremont
bottling
pours
a
murky
brown
with
tons
of
head
too
much
if
you
ask
me
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
with
massive
bubbles
on
the
head
smells
pretty
nondescript
some
sweetness
on
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
spice
tastes
dry
and
sweet
a
bit
of
yeastiness
as
well
fairly
light
on
flavour
but
well
balanced
high
carbonation
and
fairly
drinkable
overall
not
stellar
but
definitely
not
bad
dvery
drinkable
if
the
head
wasnt
so
prevelant
drinkability
ok
its
smooth
and
inoffensive
and
the
7
5
abv
is
well
hidden
otoh
it
lacks
character
and
is
boring
average
generic
dark
ale
although
not
your
typical
winter
warmer
darker
yet
less
flavor
this
isnt
translucent
its
opaque
absolutely
less
head
aroma
as
described
previously
mouthfeel
is
very
effervescent
from
the
bottle
he
followed
that
with
a
limited
tasting
of
a
bourbon
barre
aged
version
which
was
perhaps
the
best
beer
i
have
tasted
in
the
city
of
seattle
stop
in
say
hello
you
will
not
regret
the
decision
the
body
is
full
smooth
rich
and
solid
drinkabilty
is
very
good
this
is
a
great
choice
to
snuggle
with
overall
a
very
good
brew
worth
some
effort
to
try
overall
a
nice
brew
but
certainly
not
worth
seeking
out
o
good
beer
to
drink
in
the
winter
time
more
of
a
beer
to
drink
several
of
rather
than
a
single
one
with
dinner
not
as
heavy
as
expected
3
55
very
tasty
it
is
full
of
spices
and
excellent
during
the
winter
time
i
personally
love
this
seasonal
ale
my
local
liquor
store
had
a
few
extra
bottles
lucky
for
me
living
a
mile
away
from
great
lakes
its
hard
to
find
a
christmas
ale
better
than
gls
this
beer
may
have
done
just
that
breckenridge
christmas
ale
pours
brilliant
garnet
tinged
chestnut
under
a
thin
offwhite
foam
cap
that
marks
each
drink
with
a
thin
line
dried
fruit
on
the
nose
accompanies
dark
sugar
and
cake
aromas
dark
rich
cakey
bread
leads
the
palate
with
spice
figs
and
a
suspicion
of
cherry
sweetened
with
light
molasses
with
an
earthy
hop
presence
in
the
background
pours
deep
amber
nice
head
great
aroma
of
malt
and
spices
a
tad
bitter
on
the
end
but
a
great
balance
of
flavors
not
exactly
a
winter
warmer
but
a
good
beer
a
decent
but
certainly
not
extraordinary
winter
warmer
not
the
worst
christmas
beer
out
there
this
is
a
wonderful
christmas
ale
beautiful
color
and
foamy
head
with
a
warm
delightful
bready
flavor

caramel

bready
tasty

open
buried
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
raisins
and
a
tightly
packed
hop
at
the
finish
incongruous
pouring
beer
into
a
glass
is
overrated
so
i
wont
comment
on
the
color
on
this
pass
it
tastes
more
vanillay
than
most
other
winter
warmers
its
as
if
breck
just
tweak
their
vanilla
porter
recipe
to
get
this
brew
it
does
stack
up
higher
than
the
average
beer
in
regards
to
abv
but
the
elevated
alcohol
content
is
not
discernible
in
the
taste
malt
caramel
flavors
up
front
overall
a
pretty
decent
take
on
a
winter
warmer
the
winter
spice
is
very
subtle
but
there
is
a
nice
toasty
caramel
malt
flavor
had
this
poured
into
my
mug
decent
amount
of
offwhite
head
average
lacing
average
carbonation
notes
of
hazelnut
and
molasses
but
nothing
too
strong
the
color
is
a
medium
brown
very
inviting
frankly
would
have
just
liked
more
flavor
the
breckenridge
xmas
ale
is
ok
the
beer
poured
ruby
amber
with
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
carries
slight
lactose
and
some
spices
the
taste
is
bitter
thou
the
draw
and
a
funky
after
taste
the
body
is
medium
with
decent
carbonation
overall
its
ok
your
basic
christmas
ale
nothing
special
but
drinkable
definitely
worth
revisiting
overall
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
it
is
worth
a
try
maybe
im
just
uncultured
but
it
tastes
like
a
christmas
tree
has
a
kind
of
wintery
feeling
to
it
good
for
those
family
gatherings
you
really
hate
but
it
isnt
so
high
in
alcohol
that
youll
be
stumbling
around
tripping
over
a
string
of
christmas
lights
embarrassing
your
wife
and
validating
the
dislike
the
inlaws
have
always
had
for
you
plus
the
label
is
nice
and
festive
its
a
musthave
for
late
november
and
all
of
december
o
very
solid
christmas
ale
especially
for
the
price
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
you
appreciate
breckenridges
other
offerings
such
as
vanilla
porter
decent
beer
easy
to
drink
from
bottle
no
date
pours
a
dark
though
very
clear
copper
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
very
mild
some
raisinlike
aromas
rich
malt
taste
is
all
malt
not
picking
up
much
in
the
way
of
christmas
spices
mostly
a
rich
roasted
caramel
malt
backbone
balanced
well
with
mild
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
slightly
sticky
i
wish
it
was
colder
outside
maybe
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
more
in
new
hampshire
but
in
texas
i
am
less
impressed
a
nice
example
of
a
winter
ale
nice
burnt
sugar
aftertaste
worth
a
pour
excellent
christmas
ale
brewed
by
breckenridge
brewery
with
an
abv
of
7
40
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
nice
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
flavor
and
grains
you
also
pick
up
on
some
spices
in
the
smell
christmas
ale
is
a
really
inviting
brew
the
taste
is
bold
with
flavor
you
pick
up
on
the
grains
and
malts
in
this
brew
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
over
powering
in
this
brew
the
aftertaste
is
nice
with
a
burnt
caramel
taste
you
dont
notice
the
high
abv
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
filling
christmas
ale
is
smooth
but
bold
tasting
brew
this
was
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
over
all
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
25
out
of
5
overall
a
4
25
for
christmas
ale
breckenridge
brewery
i
copped
a
case
of
this
this
the
day
my
local
grocer
thats
got
a
decent
craft
selection
got
it
shipped
in
so
im
glad
i
got
a
fairly
decently
fresh
six
pack
i
will
probably
buy
this
brew
again
this
is
a
good
winter
seasonal
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
with
some
barbecue
and
was
pretty
darn
happy
its
a
little
higher
alcohol
than
some
winter
beers
but
not
so
much
that
it
knocks
you
out
after
one
or
two
not
as
intensely
flavored
as
some
others
of
this
style
and
a
bit
subtle
but
if
thats
what
you
like
then
give
this
a
try
so
good
serving
type
bottle
seasonal
beers
are
definitely
not
my
thing
but
if
anything
out
beats
the
crown
vally
imperial
pumpkin
in
the
seasonal
category
its
this
christmas
ale
by
breckenridge
its
absolutely
amazing
the
taste
is
great
very
flavorful
it
has
a
nice
color
and
it
is
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
at
anytime
ive
even
seen
it
come
in
mini
kegs
and
thats
bad
ass
around
christmas
you
would
be
insane
to
not
pick
this
up
if
you
see
it
over
all
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
as
it
was
not
what
i
expected
for
a
winter
warmer
the
beer
just
did
not
give
me
a
satisfying
finish
for
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
good
but
not
great
its
a
standard
but
pales
in
comparison
to
other
christmas
solids
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
massive
tan
head
aromas
of
vanilla
citrus
and
brown
sugar
taste
begins
with
some
vanilla
then
some
orange
then
a
big
caramel
malt
finish
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouth
feel
is
full
overall
an
easy

this
is
a
quality
pale
ale
whether
the
description
claims
otherwise

i
could
and

will
have
this
again
closer
to
christmas
o
this
beer
falls
just
a
little
shy
of
being
really
great
i
really
appreciate
a
holiday
beer
that
doesnt
load
in
the
spices
breckenridge
christmas
does
a
great
job
of
capturing
the
essence
of
the
season
without
resorting
to
the
token
buckets
full
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
i
just
would
have
liked
a
little
more
depth
and
complexity
of
malt
flavors
as
it
is
this
is
still
a
great
seasonal
offering
with
above
average
drinkability
beer
is
a
darkish
brown
that
is
clear
with
slightly
tannishand
creamy

dissipates

smell
is
strongly
that
of

strong
gingerbread
notes
and
bready
smells
no
citrus
or
hop
notes
taste
is
also
malty
with
a

finish
in
addition
to
the
bready
malt
the
taste
also
has
a
gingerbread
note
to
it
the
hop
finish
is
a
bit
butter
with
a
grapefruit
note
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
hints
of
carbonation
medium
bodied
but
with
a
little
texture
to
it
overall
a
decent
beer
theres
a
pretty
creamy
smoothness
working
well
with
just
a
little
crispness
in
whats
a
nice
solid
medium
body
hops
coming
out
into
the
finish
lend
a
little
dryness
to
a
sweeter
end
overall
a
pretty
good
cold

beer
would
recommend
if
you
are
in
a
festive
mood
but
dont
hurt
yourself
trying
to
find
it
i
wish
the
spices
were
more
prominent
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
cheers
bought
a
six
pack
for
christmas
finally
opened
some
tonight
the
drink
poured
with
a
large
head
and
some
patchy
lacing
on
the
sides
the
drink
has
a
dark
brown
amber
appearance
aromas
of
malt
and
some
hints
of
vanilla
a
very
slight
roasty
smell
i
could
sense
some
of
the
caramel
and
chocolate
the
beer
advertises
that
it
has
but
it
seemed
faint
at
least
to
me
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
toffeeish
taste
with
malt
and
nutmeg
flavors
detected
medium
body
with
a
good
balance
overall
a
pretty
good
seasonal
drink
owell
balanced
and
very
drinkable
starts
a
little
sweet
but
the
varied
malt
profile
keeps
everything
in
check
nice
beer
overall
a
good
christmas
brew
it
did
the
job
for
the
family
and
me
tis
the
season
overall
a
decent
enough
winter
warmer
not
crazy
about
the
way
the
hops
and
malts
blend
together
but
that
is
a
relatively
minor
quibble
breckenridges
christmas
ale
pours
mahogany
brown
with
a
little
bit
of
amber
highlights
making
themselves
known
as
i
hold
the
beer
up
to
light
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
cream
colored
foam
tops
the
beer
and
while
head
retention
is
somewhat
average
theres
plenty
of
lacing
left
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
disappointingly
muted
some
caramel
and
a
general
spice
aroma
are
appreciable
but
neither
exactly
leaps
out
of
the
glass
the
flavor
profile
is
similarly
dull
theres
some
caramel
sweetness
up
front
and
after
seeing
the
beers
description
on
breckenridges
mention
chocolate
i
was
able
to
pick
up
on
a
little
bit
though
maybe
just
because
i
was
looking
for
it
theres
a
moderate
bitterness
present
mid
palate
and
the
finish
is
light
holiday
spices
im
not
quite
sure
if
its
ginger
or
nutmeg
maybe
a
blend
of
the
two
the
body
could
stand
to
be
a
little
bit
more
substantial
but
the
carbonation
has
a
nice
little
kick
to
it
i
just
wasnt
that
impressed
with
breckenridges
christmas
ale
its
a
very
hohum
winter
offering
i
thought
this
was
pretty
much
how
i
like
the
style
really
liked
this
beer
hope
more
breckenridge
beers
make
it
out
to
philly
area
overall
average
not
terrible
but
many
better
beers
of
this
style
out
there
needs
some
more
flavor
too
weak
fruit
wise
malts
are
good
and
bold
but
not
balanced
very
well
nothing
i
need
to
ever
try
again
breast
and
chewy
but
it
is
a
medium
mouthfeel
some
decent
spicy
bitterness
but
this
a
malt
forward
beer
lots
of
caramel
and
a
nice
figgy
character
a
very
solid
winter
warmer
o
a
solid
christmas
ale
with
very
nice
malt
flavors
and
not
too
much
spice
definitely
preferable
to
overspiced
winter
beers
thats
for
sure
this
one
will
definitely
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
winter
night
notes
a
decent
and
drinkable
winter
warmer
cheers
a
simple
unpretentious
example
of
the
style
at
least
its
not
overloaded
with
spice
not
bad
for
a
light
xmas
ale
the
spicing
is
pretty
high
in
this
beer
but
nice
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
overall
it
is
hard
to
believe
this
is
a
christmas
ale
the
spice
profile
is
basically
non
existent
nice
maltiness
though
appearance
is
very
nice
caramel
in
color
looks
to
be
a
nice
heavy
ale
very
citrus
hoppy

mixed

and
actually
a

overall
however
i
really
tried
to
get
through
the
entire
bottle
alas
i
had
to
cast
the
last
third
to
the
polluted
depths
of
the
lake
that
caught
on
fire
to
be
with
its

says
a
quick
hi
to
your
tongue
before
being
inundated
with
a
peppery
holiday
spice
mix
there
is
a
faint
banana
flavor
that
mixes
with
the
spice
near
the
end
until
a
bit
of
alcohol
takes
that
over
dry
spicy
finish
o
ok
far
from
great
i
enjoyed
this
brew
the
spices
are
not
too
overdone
the
brew
goes
down
nice
and
easy
thanks
for
the
brew
bro
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
is
some
complexity
to
it
but
overall
its
just
a
mediocre
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
orange
amber
with
a
1
finger
bubbly
white
head
head
didnt
last
long
at
all

was
of
sour
fruit
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
if
you
got
up
close
a
very
small
touch
of
sweetness
taste
was
sweet
to
finish
but
started
off
with
very
mild
and
well
balanced
a
hint
of
spice
but
also
traces
of
a
chocolate
interesting
but
very
mellow
flavors
a
bit
under
stated
intensified
the
longer
it
sat
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
well
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
just
a
bit
more
subtle
than
i
normally
expect
the
carbonation
level
is
also
too
high
for
this
style
and
there
isnt
much
going
on
beyond
the
the
malt
backbone
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
burnt
orangereddish
hue
body
with
a
medium
sized
foamy
beige
head
that
has
decent
lasting
power
aroma
of
wet
bread
some
burnt
caramel
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
basically
malts
with
some
notes
of
gingerbread
caramel
toast
and
some
light
fruit
rinds
i
was
disappointed
as
i
expected
more
spices
and
maybe
creaminess
as
well
the
body
has
a
medium
mothfeel
and
lighter
carboantion
but
a
sort
of
slimy
feel
as
it
coats
your
mouth
wanted
more
out
of
this
one
after
a
long
search
for
this
one
overall
a
very
good
winter
warmer
very
reminiscent
of
an
old
ale
would
definitely
buy
again

o
while
i
did
not
expect
much
from
this
beer
i
enjoyed
it
more
and
more
as
time
went
on
while
its
taste
is
rather
mild
it
is
pleasant
and
while
not
considered
a
sessionable
beer
it
is
one
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
a
couple
of
breckenridge
christmas
ale
is
a
very
clear
and
sparkling
ruby
ale
with
a
sand
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
bubbly
film
and
leaves
very
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
sort
of
a
sweet
malty
aroma
of
caramel
and
chocolate
the
hops
seem
a
little
spicy
and
there
may
be
orange
peel
in
there
its
pretty
light
bodied
and
smooth
the
finish
is
quick
clean
and
dry
it
doesnt
taste
sweet
like
it
smells
its
almost
a
little
salty
dms
is
detected
along
with
a
note
of
cherry
or
plum
its
reasonably
bitter
the
bitterness
lingers
for
a
while
after
the
finish
along
with
a
peppery
rumble
and
maybe
phenol
it
tastes
ok
but
its
not
very
focused
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
but
its
a
little
strange
tasting
maybe
i
shouldnt
be
drinking
christmas
ale
in
january
dr
drinkable
but
unremarkable
and
a
bit
boring
due
to
its
muted
nature
i
like
this
take
on
the
style
there
is
a
hint
of
cinnamon
but
this
is
decidedly
a
maltforward
winter
warmer
a
quite
tasty
one
o
its
always
disappointing
when
someone
recommends
a
beer
and
you
spend
money
on
it
but
end
up
disliking

breckenridge
christmas

pours
a
deep
murky
mahogany
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
a
patch
of
bubbles
and
thin
film
are
what
remain
after
the
head
recedes
a
nice
sheet
of
light
sticky
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
christmas
in
a
glass
to
me
a
combination
of
pine
cedar
and
orange
peel
immediately
awaken
my
nose
also
faint
roasted
malts
linger
in
the
background
the
taste

also
starts
out
with
an
earthy
woody
cinnamoncedar
note
bright
orange
peel
follows
mixed
with
some

sweetness
the
finish
is
piny
hops
completing
a
wellrounded
excursion
into
my
favored
christmas
ale
year
after
year
there
is
a
notable
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
on
a
side
note
i
dig
the
artwork
on
the
bottle
it
has
a
weird
dickensonian
feel
about
it
to
me
a
bit
thinner
than
other
winterchristmas
ales
but
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
overall
a
nice
tasting
winter
seasonal
not
too
overly
spiced
and
balanced
well
with
the
malt
character
give
it
a
try
o
a
pretty
decent
brew
but
definitly
not
one
of
my
favorites
really
has
a
taste
that
makes
sense
for
the
season
but
not
so
much
on
the
smell
appearance
is
good
breckenridges
christmas
ale
brought
me
plenty
of
good
christmas
cheer
it
is
an
ideal
holiday
ale
as
it
has
plenty
of
delicious
malt
and
hop
flavour
yet
is
balanced
and
moderate
enough
so
as
to
appeal
to
more
mild
drinkers
as
well
in
other
words
its
an
excellent
option
for
family
or
work
get
togethers
a
real
crowd
and
beer
geek
pleaser
overall
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
but
thats
about
it
nothing
outstanding
but
worth
a
try
overall
not
bad
it
is
an
average
holiday
beer
i
dont
find
much
reasons
to
drink
breckenridge
beers
you
could
call
this
one
a
dark
pizza
parlor
lager
and
it
might
score
better
o
very
tasty
christmas
ale
with
good
flavor
and
aroma
would
grab
this
again
a
good
offering
goes
down
easy
as
well
pretty
good
stuff
though
decent
carbonation
and
medium
body
but
overall
this
beer
just
seems
a
little
thin
to
me
no
complexity
at
all
not
horrible
just
nothing
to
make
me
want
another
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
one
inch

of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
earthy
malt
hint
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
oatmeal
fits
the
style
of
a
winter
warmer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an

tastes
of
sweet
malt
all
spice
earthy
malt
and
a
hint
of
hop
overall
good
appearance
but
average
at
best
in
other
aspects
o
nice
solid
brew
here
easy
drinker
and
tasty
all
around
jh
o
a
rather
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
xmas
o
a
noneventful
ale
there
is
something
i
cant
figure
out
i
keep
thinking
its
diacetyl
in
the
aftertaste
maybe
im
wrong
maybe
its
there
on
purpose
anyway
a
decent
beer
but
im
not
running
out
for
more
ill
pass
on
a
2nd
one
of
these
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
above
average
carbonation
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
be
amazed
over
do
not
a
bad
offering
from
breckenridge
but
im
just
admittedly
not
a
huge
fan
of
all
that
caramel
malts
the
hops
and
spices
gave
it
a
little
mileage
for
me
but
in
the
end
it
just
feels
like
im
being
bludgeoned
by
syrupybready
caramel
sweetness
and
im
just
not
digging
it
overall
this
is
an
alright
christmas
beer
i
would
have
either
liked
more
spices
or
to
clean
up
the
taste
a
bit
if
they
wanted
to
go
the
other
way
o
a
bit
less
spiced
than
expected
but
still
very
good
from
the
2011
batch
sampled
on
december
1
2011
the
pour
is
a
handsome
dark
amber
with
a
silky
tan
head
that
lingers
momentarily
i
will
give
it
a
higher
mark
for
the
way
it
looks
however
the
aroma
is
pretty
routine
with
mellow
dark
malts
a
slight
hop
note
and
little
in
the
way
of
winter
spicing
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
so
it
makes
a
slight
comeback
with
that
the
taste
is
an
above
average
combination
of
barley
malts
and
a
moderately
bitter
quality
that
leaves
a
tingle
at
the
end
o
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
it
would
be
a
good
social
beer
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
slightly
higher
abv
it
has
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
not
feel
bad
about
it
did
not
do
it
for
me
went
in
with
decent
expectations
came
away
disappointed
cut
against
goose
island
and
great
lakes
in
same
night
and
a
very
distant
third
much
better
seasonal
ales
out
there
i
will
not
be
back
and
rest
in
fridge
is
going
to
move
slow
overall
drinkability
a
decent
winter
warmer
i
suspect
it
would
have
been
better
in
a
snifter
given
the
weak
aromas
i
wasnt
sure
about
the
spice
and
hop
combination
but
by
the
end
of
the
glass
it
grew
on
me
and
i
found
it
enjoyable
again
decent
not
outstanding
not
amazing
but
decent
and
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
very
very
nice
beer
compare
it
to
st
arnold
christmas
its
a
good
winter
warmer
and
will
go
on
my
short
list
again
pours
a
deep
brownish
red
color
which
is
a
ruby
red
color
when
its
held
to
the
light
there
is
only
a
slight
skim
head
which
gives
way
to
skim
around
the
edges
the
head
leaves
some
strings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
faint
there
are
hints
of
caramel
malts
along
with
cinnomom
and
clove
as
well
as
some
other
spiciness
the
taste
follows
close
suit
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
little
faint
not
as
full
as
i
had
hoped
for
there
is
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
it
there
is
also
touches
of
cinnomon
and
clove
along
with
a
very
slight
hop
bite
in
the
back
end
the
hope
bite
is
balanced
and
not
over
the
top
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
a
little
stingy
overall
it
as
an
okay
beer
i
wanted
a
bigger
fuller
flavor
out
of
it
it
a
very
easy
drink
the
abv
is
dangerously
well
hidden
overall
it
wasnt
remarkable
but
not
bad
either
just
a
decent
winter
warmer
here
overall
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
by
a
long
shot
tick
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
it
sounds
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
substantial
and
this
turned
out
to
be
a
session
beer
which
ok
isnt
all
that
bad
i
would
recommend
this
warmer
for
when
you
dont
want
so
much
spice
and
crazy
xmasness
this
one
is
more
like
a
real
beer
and
a
good
one
o
not
what
id
expect
from
a
christmas
ale
but
a
very
good
beer
that
breckenridge
should
be
proud
of
o
i
am
shocked
that
breckenridge
would
put
their
name
on
this
beer
they
make
some
amazing
beers
and
this
is
by
far
the
worst
one
from
them
i
know
it
is
a
bit
early
for
a
christmas
beer
but
with
the
first
snows
falling
outside
i
couldnt
resist
the
new
tap
at
my
local
poured
a
festive
redish
color
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
smells
of
caramel
malts
winter
spice
and
alcohol
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
some
subtle
hops
joining
the
mix
a
well
balanced
seasonal
brew
strong
enough
to
warm
the
soul
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
this
one
as
well
on
the
heavier
side
but
not
filling
a
great
evening
sipper
as
the
snow
falls
out
front
3
0
d
to
summarize
not
much
going
on
but
nothing
bad
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
nice
red
colored
body
and
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
lacing
on
this
one
was
decent
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
sweet
malts
in
there
mixed
with
a
sturdy
amount
of
christmas
spices
the
taste
of
the
beer
reminded
me
of
a
sam
adams
winter
lager
there
was
plenty
of
flavors
in
this
stuff
to
warm
you
up
in
the
cold
season
the
mouthfeel
was
about
medium
bodied
and
was
highly
drinkable
overall
this
beer
fits
the
season
nicely
i
think
o
decent
christmas
brew
my
brother
really
like
this
one
a
good
price
too
worth
a
shot
if
you
havent
tried
it
im
guessing
this
is
the
right
place
to
put
this
review
as
the
only
other
one
listed
is
the
christmas
ale
2010
entry
big
thanks
goes
out
to
robwestcott
for
sending
me
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
past
trade
bottle
968
of
1400
2008
vintage
limited
special
edition
served
from
a
33
oz
swingtop
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
sweet
alcohol
and
slight
peat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
subtle
peat
and
very
slight
oxidation
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
had
a
pretty
nice
flavor
here
minus
the
slight
oxidation
i
got
on
it
the
aroma
was
quite
nice
too
not
sure
if
i
would
put
this
one
in
the
winter
warmer
category
if
im
honest
but
still
a
pretty
good
brew
really
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
a
more
modest
carbonation
yields
a
small
head
here
the
lacing
does
a
good
beery
job
of
sticking
though
cookie
dough
burnt
sugar
plum
pudding
and
toasted
bread
show
not
only
its
strength
but
the
thickness
of
malt
from
the
aroma
creamy
full
body
full
malt
jacket
herethis
beer
is
not
kidding
around
brown
bread
brown
sugar
toasted
marshmallows
and
a
toasted
husk
flavor
abound
warmth
kicks
in
midpint
and
stays
mellow
hops
are
certainly
big
enough
to
at
least
stand
up
to
the
sizable
maltiness
the
bitterness
does
not
try
to
crush
the
malt
but
rather
tames
it
sweet
roasty
and
slightly
hoppy
finish
a
solid
winter
warmer
it
is
a
fairly
high
7
4
abv
but
not
outstanding
d
very
nice
little
brew
here
fits
the
style
to
a
tee
worth
looking
for
during
the
winter
months
d
this
is
a
nicely
robust
ale
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
just
noticeable
finger
on
the
malt
side
of
the
scale
alcohol
is
discernable
but
plays
well
with
others
a
good
some
might
say
understated
borderline
big
seasonal
a
sort
of
heft
brown
perhaps
aged
a
bit
very
english
in
style
rather
than
some
american
spiced
seasonal
contraption
breckenridge
christmas
looks
very
chestnut
brown
in
color
with
a
cinnamon
tan
foam
about
an
inch
in
height
with
pretty
good
legs
but
no
lacing
smell
is
all
caramel
malt
and
some
nutty
appeal
spices
are
really
not
in
the
picture
taste
is
malty
and
caramel
and
nuts
and
a
bit
of
spice
but
not
much
there
is
a
taste
of
alcohol
towards
the
end
the
7
4
is
not
muted
well
dont
get
any
hops
and
this
is
not
reminding
me
of
christmas
its
pretty
much
a
very
malty
brown
ale
imo
feel
is
a
big
medium
malty
not
bitter
smooth
and
fairly
carbed
i
drank
it
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
would
like
it
to
have
more
well
just
about
everything
it
is
lightly
carbonated
but
it
could
use
more
body
before
they
crank
that
up
as
it
is
it
is
ok
i
am
enjoying
it
and
will
absolutely
finish
my
glass
but
i
doubt
that
i
will
religiously
pick
this
one
up
like
i
do
hibernation
ale
or
old
jubilation
served
on
tap
at
the
tap
house
grill
in
oswego
il
poured
a
dark
redbrown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
persists
another
winter
spice
ale
this
one
a
bit
less
spiceforward
than
most
letting
some
left
coast
hops
contribute
the
citrus
note
and
the
dominant
spice
out
a
fairly
well
muted
bunch
was
the
cloves
not
the
usual
cinnamon
not
a
brew
to
rave
about
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
a
few
pints
if
it
was
served
at
someones
holiday
party
either
out
of
the
usual
array
of
spiced
beers
id
give
this
one
the
nod
over
most
d
well
i
couldnt
seeing
buying
this
again
but
as
one
of
my
ticks
on
my
list
i
really
was
disappointed
need
more
of
a
smoother
malt
profile
to
balance
the
grain
and
what
crappy
ales
like
this
needs
more
spice
average
medium
body
soft
carbonation
which
gives
an
almost
creamy
feel
the
mouthfeel
may
be
the
best
part
of
this
beer
some
warming
alcohol
overall
not
really
that
great
malt
character
seems
a
bit
cloying
with
not
enough
spice
to
help
balance
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
christmas
beer
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
not
overly
sweet
as
some
can
be
pretty
solid
might
have
to
watch
out
with
the
high
abv
however
picked
up
a
single
from
abes
cold
beer
it
poured
brown
with
a
short
offwhite
head
theres
a
big
initial
hit
of
spice
in
the
aroma
but
that
leveled
off
and
left
a
roasted
cocoa
scent
essentially
this
beer
has
a
fairly
tasty
somewhat
imperial
brown
ale
at
its
base
with
a
touch
of
heavy
roast
mixed
in
the
christmas
spicing
is
subtle
enough
with
some
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
type
notes
in
there
im
not
certain
thats
what
it
is
medium
in
body
nicely
carbonated
and
not
too
thin
overall
not
bad
i
get
a
sort
of
brown
alewinter
warmer
cross
which
is
interesting
and
seems
to
work
well
together
the
bad
part
is
the
watery
nature
of
the
mouthfeel
this
brew
has
a
real
weird
but
enjoyable
malty
quality
i
wish
i
could
convey
andor
explain
to
you
but
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
probably
more
worthy
of
a
draft
selection
than
a
whole
6pack
investment
average
at
best
future
outlook
solid
enjoyable
warmer
that
doesnt
quite
feel
like
it
really
is
one
i
remember
this
beer
tasting
more
spiced
in
the
past
nevertheless
id
be
happy
to
give
it
another
whirl
next
year
there
are
no
bad
flavors
overall
this
is
a
pretty
straight
up
solid
beer
would
like
just
a
little
more
body
and
depth
of
malt
flavor
to
fill
this
one
out
a
bit
this
beer
was
ok
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
again
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
like
to
try
another
one
of
these
delicious
beer
for
those
cold
winter
nights
drinkable
yes
probably
finishing
the
liter
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
surprisingly
smooth
my
favorite
among
other
seasonal
christmas
ale
s
i
have
tried
d
pretty
easy
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
good
for
a
session
and
has
enough
flavor
to
make
it
worth
it
enjoyable
if
not
one
of
the
best
winter
brews
needs
flavor
i
think
is
the
major
problem
drinkability
decent
winter
ale
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
want
more
of
a
malt
focused
beer
for
the
holidays
this
will
work
overall
a
drinkable
christmas
beer
but
nothing
to
get
overly
excited
about
alright
at
bestthis
one
certainly
doesnt
wow
me
in
any
way
the
hops
come
across
a
bit
too
assertive
for
the
style
and
while
not
unpleasant
just
dont
fit
here
two
finger
light
brown
head
gusher
medium
dissipation
with
minimal

over
deep

dark

hops
taste
is
prunes

though
note
the
taste
isnt
as
deep
or
satisfying
as
2010
anchor
our
special
ale
which
this
beer
reminds
me
of
mouthfeel
on
the
light
side
of
medium
this
isnt
very
full
bodied
some
effervescence
but
not
a
lot
ok
drinkability
but
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
make
this
a
onetime
shot
conclusion
this
beer
is
an
alright
winter
warmer
but
there
are
better
choices
with
less
alcohol
a
bonus
in
my
book
a
dopplbock
of
this
strength
can
be
much
maltier
and
richer
which
begs
this
question
why
isnt
this
beer
maltier
and
richer
d
overall
not
bad
i
get
a
sort
of
brown
alewinter
warmer
cross
which
is
interesting
and
seems
to
work
well
together
the
bad
part
is
the
watery
nature
of
the
feel
and
the
7
5
abv
is
nice
for
its
warming
property
but
not
so
nice
for
wanting
to
drink
a
few
as
far
as
winter
warmers
go
though
its
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
found
it
has
a
nice
weight
to
it
as
well
breckenridge
has
pretty
good
selection
in
beers
i
saw
this
christmas
ale
that
just
got
into
my
beer
store
theres
nothing
really
christmasy
about
its
average
at
best
as
a
beer
but
still
relatively
drinkable
it
has
a
harsh
taste
to
it
and
a
little
bitter
flavor
d
not
very
high
probably
my
least
favorite
winter
warmer
at
7
4
abv
i
would
have
expected
a
slightly
boozier
brew
but
this
is
rather
refreshing
it
has
a
fruit
cake
quality
to
it
but
its
not
heavy
like
a
fruit
cake
perhaps
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
worth
trying
for
fans
of
the
genre
carbonation
takes
up
a
big
chunk
of
the
flavor
slight
diacetyl
touch
not
enough
to
really
draw
me
into
this
british
world
but
enough
to
sort
of
nag
lightmedium
mouthfeel
with
wild
bubbles
that
leave
naught
but
some
spices
on
the
palate
in
the
finish
this
isnt
a
recipe
that
needs
scrapping
but
some
revamp
will
have
to
take
place
before
i
get
another
the
foam
was
light
wheat
in
color
bubbley
and
lacey
the
color

a

some

on

and
a
bitter

the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
drinkability
is
average
the
abv
is
suitable
for
a
warmer
it
actually
does
that
unlike
so
many
others
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
i
suppose
if
you
wan
to
get
drunk
would
be
the
alcohol
content
at
7
4
besides
that
yuck
alcohol
is
warming
to
the
belly
feel
is
slick
and
slightly
tingly
from
the
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
does
not
abuse
spicing
or
alcohol
an
excellent
winter
beer
a
little
thinner
body
higher
carbonation
some
dryness
as
well
drinks
okay
but
the
alcohol
wasnt
masked
well
and
the
flavors
had
some
metallic
notes
at
times
not
really
something
id
seek
out
again
d
its
ok
not
my
favorite
as
opposed
to
what
you
can
get
in
co
with
gd
odell
avery
and
nb
offerings
abv
is
decently
hidden
but
just
a
bit
too
syrupy
and
too
much
toffee
taste
one
is
enough
cannot
decide
a
style
for
this
beer
in
a
way
it
is
like
a
dubbel
but
a
bit
of
hoppiness
on
the
way
down
make
it
almost
like
an
esb
interesting
beer
a
bit
yeasty
pours
a
very
nice
brownishred
colour
very
appealing
has
a
nice
head
with
lacing
btw
drank
this
barely
above
room
temperature
kinda
slightly
creamy
with
a
bunch
of
particles
floating
in
beer
and
quite
simple
and
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
one
overall
impression
not
much
complexity
average
christmas
ale
not
a
favorite
drinkability
pretty
decent
brew
but
not
terribly
complex
on
the
other
hand
theres
enough
complexity
to
make
it
worth
thinking
about
while
you
taste
overall
i
got
this
because
i
have
heard
good
things
about
the
brewery
and
my
general
affinity
for
christmaswinter
beers
and
colorado
unfortunately
this
beer
looked
the
part
but
was
disappointing
skip
this
and
go
for
the
samuel
smiths
winter
welcome
cheers
a
modest
offering
for
the
holiday
season
i
enjoyed
its
simplicity
and
quaffability
very
smooth
finish
slight
citrus
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
i
cannot
help
but
look
over
some
of
the
reviews
for
this
beer
and
wonder
if
we
are
drinking
the
same
beer
this
was
poured
at
slighly
cooler
then
cellar
temperature
which
is
how
i
like
all
of
my
warmers
im
sure
my
rdev
on
this
will
be
through
the
roof
but
this
beer
does
not
deserve
the
low
overall
rating
that
it
has
if
you
like
warmers
that
have
some
nice
subdued
spicing
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
d
easily
drinkable
numerous
christmas
ales
or
winter
warmers
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
fading
fast
one
fingered
tan
head
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
entire
glass
aromas
of
cinnamon
toffee
brown
sugar
and
malts
on
the
palate
a
sweet
copious
amount
of
spice
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
desent
enough
brew
that
is
worthy
of
more
than
one
tasting
overall
this
beer
overall
was
ok
not
something
i
would
drink
on
the
regular
definitely
good
with
a
meal
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
i
like
how
it
was
not
excessively
hoppy
or
spicy
but
offered
just
enough
bitterness
and
kick
to
keep
it
respectable
it
is
an
excellent
alternative
to
the
hop
bombs
released
for
the
winter
holiday
season
deep
brown
with
an
amber
hue
in
color
pours
with
a
short
offwhite
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
a
few
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
sweet
malty
and
toasted
malt
aromas
are
dominant
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
raisins
and
nuts
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
through
the
middle
sweet
and
toasted
malts
in
the
beginning
that
slowly
give
way
to
nutty
flavors
and
a
mild
bitter
finish
very
easy
to
drink
the
higher
abv
slowly
moves
in
as
you
drink
this
one
2008
vintage
in
swingtop
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
into
the
trusty
old
pint
shaker
glass
aroma
was
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
spices
taste
was
malty
goodness
with
some
spices
finish
was
very
odd
kind
of
sour
or
spices
gone
bad
normally
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
brews
i
dont
believe
ill
age
one
this
long
again
decent
but
definitely
off
overall
good
beer
a
bit
sweet
for
me
unless
its
paired
with
food
id
like
more
clovescinnamon
in
a
winter
warmer
other
than
that
i
enjoyed
it
this
brew
is
pretty
good
the
drink
is
pretty
easy
and
i
enjoyed
it
it
would
be
a
bit
hard
to
take
in
more
then
one
of
these
the
brew
is
great
but
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
might
just
be
to
much
still
a
great
christmas
ale
gets
better
as
you
get
closer
to
the
end
of
the
6pack
though
as
expected
overall
for
a
christmas
ale
this
beer
is
mild
by
most
measures
as
most
brewers
tend
to
push
the
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
levels
to
unimagined
heights
as
if
christmas
could
be
made
more
christmassy
through
the
boiling
and
tincturing
of
its
traditional
aromatics
not
so
with
breckenridge
its
definitely
a
christmas
ale
my
first
comment
after
my
initial
sip
was
that
it
was
an
outofseason
experience
however
once
you
settle
into
the
pint
the
mild
spiciness
that
is
so
evident
at
first
quiets
and
leaves
behind
a
perfectly
quaffable
ale
it
isnt
sickly
sweet
although
it
is
sweet
the
medium
body
and
carbonation
present
a
drinking
experience
that
isnt
as
syrupy
as
the
beer
actually
is
if
my
experience
doesnt
match
other
reviewers
blame
the
six
months
in
the
back
of
a
liquor
store
i
wont
say
its
a
bad
beer
because
really
its
not
it
just
wasnt
anything
worth
trying
again
im
tempted
to
call
this
beer
boring
but
sometimes
thats
what
you
might
be
looking
for
a
dark
amber
to
red
color
pour
with
a
foamy
light
tan
head
lasting
a
short
time
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
cinnamon
cola
nuts
and
maybe
fruit
flavor
is
sweet
with
the
promised
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
maybe
some
cherries
cinnamon
and
other
spice
notes
full
body
creamy
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
slight
warming
effect
a
little
alcohol
and
dusty
grain
in
the
finish
nothing
to
put
me
off
but
not
really
my
thing
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
but
not
what
what
im
looking
for
this
is
a
pretty
boring
xmas
ale
d
goes
down
easy
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
it
did
not
sit
to
well
for
some
reason
pours
a
chestnut
brown
clear
without
suspension
theres
yeast
in
there
though
i
can
smell
em
along
with
roasted
coffee
beans
and
a
metallic
quality
also
aluminum
foil
taste
is
not
of
aluminum
but
of
black
coffee
unsweetened
chocolate
and
some
caramel
sweetness
theres
also
a
peppery
hop
presence
but
overall
this
one
is
bitter
much
like
a
porter
wait
is
this
a
porter
mouthfeel
is
on
the
watery
side
so
im
guessing
the
body
is
thinned
out
with
some
adjuncts
not
a
bad
thing
necessarily
and
i
cant
taste
them
anyway
unless
they
burned
them
first
i
mean
roasted
them
yes
it
has
a
strong
roasted
malt
character
through
and
through
finish
is
bitter
dry
and
bitter
i
wont
seek
this
one
out
in
the
future
but
i
will
purchase
said
beer
again
on
the
1
99
discount
rack
if
the
situation
arises
it
is
warming
me
this
winter
with
7
4
abv
after
all
a
pretty
good
sipper
on
a
cold
night
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
tho
it
is
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
d
very
flavorful
and
balanced
again
in
the
quaff
lite
hints
of
chocolate
cinnamon
and
malt
more
along
the
lines
of
a
holiday
brown
ale
than
winter
warmer
ya
know
a
fairly
tasty
brew
but
not
in
the
ballpark
of
a
spicy
winter
brew
d
this
is
an
average
winter
warmer
it
is
unique
but
one
that
i
probably
wouldnt
have
again
d
easy
drinking
a
great
social
beer
very
easy
to
session
d
i
do
like
to
drink
this
beer
every
now
and
then
i
will
most
likely
pick
up
a
6pack
or
two
every
winter
nice
body
to
this
winter
warmer
as
expected
lightly
carbonated
and
more
than
sippable
could
see
this
one
creeping
up
on
an
unsuspecting
imbiber
well
done
decent
easy
drinking
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
bitey
gently
spiced
and
drinkable
like
a
spiced
wafer
pours
a
translucent
dark
mahogany
with
a
finebubbled
beige
head
aroma
is
spicy
mainly
cinnamon
and
somewhat
malty
mouthfilling
flavor
is
spicy
mostly
cinnamon
and
cloves
with
a
fruity
undertone
and
a
hint
of
spicy
hard
candy
texture
is
rough
lively
and
tingly
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
deep
ruby
with
a
light
tan
creamy
head
that
leaves
cascades
of
lacing
rich
sweet
fruit
notes
with
grapefruit
and
piney
hops
raisin
and
citrus
hops
all
the
way
through
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
finish
with
a
touch
of
bitter
pine
d
overall
this
is
a
nice
winter
offering
good
complexity
and
nice
warmth
make
this
a
fitting
winter
brew
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
left
12
of
offwhite
head
that
reduced
to
a
film
leaving
good
lacing
smells
malty
maybe
a
little
peach
color
is
a
dark
amber
taste
is
smooth
with
a
bitter
finish
some
spices
suitable
for
a
christmas
ale
body
is
thin
to
medium
mild
carbonation
i
wouldnt
drink
a
sixpack
of
this
in
one
go
but
its
certainly
not
bad
deep
reddishamber
topped
by
a
loose
offwhite
head
aroma
has
a
slight
hint
of
cherry
and
honey
not
much
else
flavor
is
also
dominated
by
honey
notes
followed
by
a
mixture
of
burnt
sugar
and
alcohol
not
really
all
that
complex
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
a
bit
watery
carbonation
is
great
drinkability
is
ok
but
its
really
a
rather
boring
beer
poured
into
pint
glass
amber
with
a
thck
frothy
head
great
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
scent
has
a
hop
presence
the
taste
has
the
hops
up
front
that
are
found
in
the
nose
but
it
really
doesnt
have
much
of
a
sweet
aftertaste
like
a
winter
warmer
should
this
is
more
like
an
aipa
than
a
ww
that
being
said
it
masks
the
high
alcohol
well
which
really
doesnt
match
the
style
either
im
not
normally
into
winter
holiday
spiced
beers
but
im
working
on
it
this
year
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
crisp
dark
copper
with
a
thin
diminishing
offwhite
head
aroma
is
caramel
malts
mild
spice
and
slight
hops
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
burnt
caramel
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
slight
pine
hops
providing
a
nice
backbone
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
its
7
4
well
hidden
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
winter
warmer
one
i
would
love
to
have
again
clear
golden
body
with
an
off
white
foamy
cap
subtle
spice
in
the
aroma
with
a
mild
hop
character
and
graininess
the
taste
reminds
me
of
saint
arnold
christmas
ale
light
body
every
bit
if
booze
evident
a
corn
syrup
flavor
and
some
vanilla
caramel
spice
to
build
up
the
finish
which
offers
a
piney
profile
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
borderline
syrupy
and
under
carbonated
decent
but
not
too
impressed
the
smell
of
the
brew
offers
a
sweet
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
coming
out
the
color
of
the
head
is
offwhite
and
the
lacing
is
thin
and
dissipates
the
beer
itself
is
a
solid
amber
kinda
close
to
yuengling
traditional
lager
at
7
4
abv
its
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
at
least
once
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
colorado
and
am
near
the
breckenridge
brewpub
ill
be
heading
in
for
a
few
brews
and
some
bbq
ribs
merry
christmas
and
heres
to
breckenridge
brewery
cheers
and
drink
well
drinkability
pretty
decent
drinkability
at
7
4
abv
some
people
might
tucker
out
after
a
few
to
me
that
tends
to
be
a
good
thing
certainly
good
flavor
for
something
that
high
abv
d
pretty
darn
drinkable
in
my
opinion
and
exhibits
less
of
or
at
least
to
a
lesser
degree
the
sometimes
overbearing
characteristics
of
a
christmas
ale
a
plus
if
you
are
easily
overwhelmed
by
overly
sweet
and
spicy
brews
this
time
of
year
d
a
little
bit
boring
for
me
to
consider
this
particularly
drinkable
3

i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
although
the
bottle
design
is
very
festive
it
pours
a
ruby
brown
color
the
smell
is
very
faint
and
not
much
going
on
in
that
department
the
taste
is
unimpressive
in
the
sense
if
i
was
blindfolded
i
might
think
im
drinking
a
bud
uhoh
at
7
4
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
i
would
pass
on
this
one
there
are
too
many
limited
xmas
beers
to
try
over
this
one
great
beer
for
the
holiday
season
would
drink
again
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
i
will
look
for
it
in
the
future
as
far
as
the
style
goes
its
probably
not
the
best
representation
but
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
it
is
what
it
is
and
that
is
average
drinks
pretty
easily
one
im
sure
ill
have
again
a
solid
offering
but
a
pretty
standard
one
at
that
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
bit
watery
drinkability
i
forgot
what
i
paid
for
a
single
but
i
wish
i
had
a
bought
the
six
pack
mouthfeel
is
a
solid
medium
body
with
some
zest
oils
creating
a
dense
body
very
nice
warmer
quite
drinkable
warming
decent
body
and
mildy
creamy
drinkability
meh
you
can
drink
it
but
i
certainly
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
it
seems
another
reviewer
nailed
it
when
writing
played
it
safe
as
theres
really
nothing
that
jumps
out
of
this
one
it
seems
that
if
youre
only
going
to
release
something
like
this
on
a
limited
run
each
year
make
it
more
worthwhile
just
my
02
notes
delicious
light
crisp
sweet
beer
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
defined
as
a
winter
warmer
fits
the
traditional
bock
mold
in
my
opinion
overall
a
nice
drinkable
holiday
beer
to
have
on
hand
pours
with
minimal
head
even
with
a
pretty
vigorous
pour
color
is
a
tawny
caramel
brown
with
amber
highlights
when
held
toward
the
light
head
is
a
light
cream
hue
and
forms
speckled
lacing
scattered
around
my
chalice
aromatics
are
muted
a
bit
but
there
is
some
faint
citrus
qualities
with
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
spices
flavor
is
very
light
on
the
spice
additions
and
hop
bitterness
a
touch
of
that
citrus
and
pine
in
the
finish
caramel
malt
drives
the
flavor
with
a
nice
winter
warmer
nothing
over
the
top
this
beer
plays
it
pretty
safe
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
easygoing
nothing
big
to
report
here
move
along
to
some
more
interesting
christmas
ales
this
one
was
priced
right
and
not
bad
this
may
be
my
value
beer
this
season
taste
really
balanced
between
spice
and
sweetness
nice
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
easily
approachable
seasonal
for
beer
beginners
drinkability
although
theres
not
a
lot
of
spice
or
wintery
flavor
the
subtlety
of
this
beers
flavor
and
well
masked
alcohol
make
for
a
pretty
decent
drinker
especially
compared
to
some
of
the
more
overspiced
winter
warmers
out
there
reminds
me
of
the
fact
that
breckenridges
avalanche
was
another
good
session
beer
drinkability
its
good
and
has
a
nicely
masked
abv
but
there
is
nothing
really
special
or
amazing
about
this
beer
the
alcohol
shows
up
a
ton
on
this
and
the
malt
is
too
burnt
for
my
liking
i
guess
it
doesnt
help
im
drinking
a
winter
warmer
in
the
middle
of
summer
id
imagine
this
one
is
better
in
colder
weather
pours
a
nice
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
spicy
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
spicy
slightly
bitter
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
ww
recommend
picked
up
at
warehouse
beverage
cleveland
pours
dark
colour
virtually
no
head
aroma
is
a
touch
of
roast
and
thats
it
taste
is
spoton
cocacolawith
spices
added
such
as
ginger
and
allspice
ok
but
not
so
drinkable
tonight
after
so
many
good
spicey
meals
above
average
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
d
drinkable
i
wanted
to
clear
this
out
of
the
fridge
as
it
wont
be
cold
in
north
texas
until
october
probably
and
i
was
not
disappointed
the
drinkability
is
low
not
because
of
the
abv
but
because
this
beer
just
doesnt
come
together
the
flavors
act
like
they
are
arguing
drinkability
its
not
very
harsh
so
easily
sippable
but
its
not
really
a
winter
warmer
in
my
book
after
a
few
sips
the
flavor
starts
to
grate
on
your
taste
buds
ill
pass
next
year
and
im
starting
to
get
this
general
impression
of
most
of
brecks
brews
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
a
rich
and
fairly
heavy
seasonal
and
certainly
one
thats
not
recommended
for
a
session
but
its
a
fairly
flavorful
malt
bomb
one
certainly
right
for
christmas
and
though
i
enjoyed
it
im
glad
i
only
got
one
bottle
and
didnt
buy
more
than
this
a
nice
winter
warmer
poured
nice
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
mahogany
of
the
sides
nice
2
finger
head
not
too
much
smell
to
it
some
hops
in
there
much
more
flavor
than
smell
decent
brew
mainly
taste
roasted
malt
a
little
sweet
and
the
had
has
a
pleasant
bitter
hop
finish
but
definitley
not
too
bitter
or
i
wouldnt
like
it
i
would
get
this
again
for
sure
but
there
are
too
many
other
great
winter
brews
that
outshine
this
but
no
doubt
worthy
pours
caramel
with
a
thin
quickly
dissapating
head
sweet
molasses
in
the
nose
good
thickness
in
the
mouth
as
the
beer
hits
your
tongue
but
not
much
flavor
in
the
finish
vaguely
sweet
and
a
little
chewy
virtually
no
bitterness
probably
would
not
get
this
one
again
no
bitter
hop
finish
but
you
can
taste
and
feel
the
alcohol
long
after
youve
swallowed
while
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
nothing
exceptional
and
i
cant
see
myself
seeking
this
out
to
enjoy
more
than
just
this
one
roasty
dark
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
just
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
and
a
light
peppery
bitterness
rich
but
drinkable
very
smooth
for
a
beer
approaching
8
abv
full
mouth
and
a
sweet
and
roasty
finish
lovely
stuff
dvery
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
polish
off
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
that
said
its
drinkability
does
not
make
this
a
bland
boring
beer
it
has
deep
flavors
on
top
of
flavors
making
it
enjoyable
to
drink
as
well
as
smooth
pours
a
dark
transparent
reddish
amber
with
a
light
tan
cap
that
retains
adequately
and
leaves
lots
of
swisscheese
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
other
spicemaybe
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
as
well
this
tastes
like
a
big
fat
cinnamon
roll
just
the
right
touch
of
sweetness
and
spicewith
a
smooth
alcohol
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinbut
the
carbonation
is
a
little
creamy
and
gives
it
a
fuller
finish
than
the
start
a
nice
ww
just
right
for
a
cold
christmas
eve
morning
like
this
overall
good
semicomplex
flavor
and
a
good
nose
a
little
different
for
this
particular
style
but
a
pretty
decent
overall
quaff
notes
from

d
dont
think
most
people
would
want
to
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
cheers
quite
drinkable
and
ok
overall
this
seemed
more
like
a
funky
malty
wine
than
a
beer
wow
i
didnt
realize
that
this
was
7
4
until
i
just
now
looked
this
is
extremely
drinkable
for
a
winter
warmer
the
subtle
spiciness
is
nice
as
well
some
beers
of
this
style
go
overboard
in
that
department
after
reading
the
other
reviews
the
smell
is
actually
a
good
thing
learning
is
fun
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
small
head
that
lasts
a
little
while
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
surface
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
spice
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
just
average
sweet
malt
with
a
little
spice
and
alcohol
on
finish
mild
overall
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
does
have
a
nice
semicreamy
texture
carbonation
is
kept
in
check
a
nice
beer
but
will
not
impress
many
beer
advocates
the
high
abv
limits
drinkability
overall
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
overall
im
disappointed
once
again
by
this
brewery
they
sucked
me
in
with
the
471
small
batch
and
its
been
downhill
from
there
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
by
any
stretch
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
better
ones
of
the
style
out
there
poured
a
dark
clear
copper
color
with
a
very
light
off
white
head
left
minimal
cover
with
almost
no
lacing
it
did
smell
like
a
christmas
ale
with
a
presence
of
cinammon
and
nutmeg
the
flavors
were
not
as
pronounced
while
drinking
and
the
carbonation
was
a
little
underwhelming
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
the
breckenridge
brewery
and
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
a
fairly
average
winter
warmer
on
tap
at
sonkas
irish
pub
terre
haute
in
would
be
nice
as
a
session
brew
flavor
is
interesting
with
a
malty
but
not
overpowering
character
certainly
worth
a
try
not
all
bad
but
not
one
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
next
holiday
season
samuel
smiths
winter
welcome
ale
and
samuel
adams
winter
lager
this
assuredly
isnt
another
reviewer
mentioned
that
it
was
too
hoppy
i
must
disagree
while
this
style
shouldnt
be
hoppy
i
felt
it
didnt
have
enough
however
i
may
be
a
bit
biased
as
i
really
prefer
the
hops
d
maybe
im
trippin
but
this
could
be
served
in
a
wine
glass
extreme
wine
characteristics
maybe
more
so
than
any
beer
ive
had
but
it
is
fitting
and
i
like
it
not
a
monster
abv
but
this
one
commands
sipping
in
my
opinion
its
unique
and
interesting
and
i
could
go
for
a
couple
more
this
is
just
another
mediocre
and
bland
winter
warmer
that
has
to
many
hops
for
the
style
imo
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
holiday
beers
but
if
this
one
is
an
example
i
will
be
anxious
to
try
more
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
winter
day
overall
i
like
yet
there
are
many
many
many
other
winter
warmers
that
toast
my
buns
better
than
this
one
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
clear
brown
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
some
piney
hops
medium
bodied
on
the
malty
side
some
chocolate
malt
a
pretty
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
not
very
memorable
but
fairly
drinkable
comforting
warmer
to
mellow
you
out
roasty
aroma
some
coffee
and
caramel
and
a
good
helping
of
hops
wish
it
were
stronger
dark
brown
pour
with
a
thin
head
but
ample
lacing
medium
mouthfeel
but
its
rich
and
filling
with
a
real
easy
finish
for
such
a
sturdy
beer
flavor
is
an
excellent
bundle
of
roasted
toasted
malts
mild
hops
some
minimal
spices
and
a
touch
of
coffee
and
rich
brown
sugar
this
is
like
the
christmas
rum
cake
of
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hoppy
spiced
brown
ale
the
spices
are
very
subtle
but
overall
its
a
well
balanced
beer
i
can
see
being
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
its
definitely
light
enough
to
pack
these
away
if
given
the
opportunity
im
not
sure
the
taste
is
my
thing
but
its
definitely
drinkable
i
like
many
of
brecks
seasonal
offerings
but
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
many
beers
lack
hops
this
one
probably
just
needed
a
different
variety
maybe
goldings
d
a
pretty
solid
beer
has
some
interesting
ipa
sub
tones
the
good
news
is
that
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
so
i
have
a
few
more
at
home
ive
been
happy
with
the
other
brews
ive
sampled
from
this
colorado
brewery
and
this
is
no
exception
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
deep
dirty
brown
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
that
faded
quickly
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
of
some
light
malts
sweetness
with
cinnamon
and
some
mild
clove
the
taste
is
modest
there
is
some
light
roasted
malt
taste
some
faint
stailness
to
it
might
be
left
from
a
2007
batch
the
finish
was
a
little
more
alcohol
than
i
would
want
ok
brew
but
nothing
special
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
is
what
we
have
here
a
pretty
good
beer
i
was
personally
expecting
something
a
little
better
from
a
great
brewery
like
breckenridge
it
has
a
nice
smooth
feel
with
a
nutty
after
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
bite
at
the
end
a
good
pairing
with
a
cold
colorado
night
go
for
it
piurs
to
a
deep
warm
dark
brown
hosting
just
an
inch
of
solid
tan
head
that
just
doesnt
stay
around
as
long
as
youd
like
it
to
gone
in
minutes
nose
is
faint
with
ashey
spices
and
soft
soured
fruit
and
a
hint
of
sweet
maltiness
first
thing
you
notice
as
you
take
first
sip
is
a
distinct
hoppy
feel
wraped
in
a
bit
of
crisp
almost
soured
fruit
the
malt
feel
is
long
and
mineral
based
yeilding
to
a
quite
creamy
smooth
bit
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dry
with
a
burnt
bitterness
creating
a
thickness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
easy
to
drink
could
be
a
bit
more
bold
though
the
alcohol
is
not
detectable
decent
beer
but
not
much
of
a
good
drinker
much
better
xmas
beers
out
there
this
needs
more
of
everything
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
shining
example
of
a
winter
warmer
the
spices
are
there
the
malt
is
there
the
hops
are
barely
noticeable
but
somehow
it
never
really
came
together
to
make
a
great
beer
taste
is
better
not
great
but
pleasant
plenty
of
toffee
sweetness
mild
bitterness
milder
spiciness
nothing
to
detract
from
drinkability
but
not
quite
the
bigflavored
cold
weather
strong
sipper
id
like
from
this
incarnation
of
the
style
pretty
dry
finish
with
a
light
sweetness
lingering
on
my
palate
body
is
on
the
light
side
which
doesnt
help
some
aspects
but
seems
to
help
drinkability
a
bit
here
sure
ill
have
another
but
it
falls
short
of
a
seasonal
musthave
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
dark
copper
forming
a
very
thin
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
very
small
light
spots
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
lights
hints
of
spices
the
taste
is
malty
caramel
with
an
equal
emphasis
on
the
spices
and
hops
the
taste
is
highly
dominated
by
the
malts
but
the
hops
come
out
a
little
more
in
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
finish
good
flavor
and
medium
alcohol
content
make
for
a
drinkable
winter
warmer
overall
this
winter
warmer
was
okay
but
not
something
that
i
would
keep
on
hand
through
the
winter
months
not
a
bad
beer
a
very
solid
offering
from
breckenridge
that
i
would
session
any
time
nothing
over
the
top
a
very
sessionable
beer
indeed
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
is
clear
and
has
a
nice
creme
head
nose
is
bland
very
little
caramel
there
flavor
is
a
bit
tart
the
zing
is
a
wee
bit
much
really
there
are
some
nice
brown
aleesqe
characters
here
decent
earthy
edge
nice
leafy
tone
but
the
citrusy
zingy
character
is
just
singing
a
bit
too
high
feel
is
decent
with
a
thicker
liquid
body
and
a
slightly
lower
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
okay
winter
warmer
a
bit
off
balance
and
thick
in
the
wrong
places
but
it
is
still
fairly
drinkable
cheers
d
decent
brew
and
drinkable
for
7
4
there
are
better
winter
warmers
out
there
though
decent
looking
dark
rubybrown
color
with
dark
head
smells
a
bit
hoppy
with
some
sweet
prunelike
odor
and
maybe
some
spice
im
not
crazy
about
the
flavor
its
bitter
with
some
lingering
unpleasant
aftertaste
like
the
bitterness
of
an
orange
peel
good
body
and
texture
but
not
very
drinkable
pretty
mediocre
in
my
opinion
poured
from
bottle
local
shop
had
these
on
clearance
and
well
within
the
best
buy
date
so
i
thought
why
not
i
should
have
thought
not
poured
into
pint
glass
and
pours
deep
dark
red
very
dark
looking
with
thin
head
with
poor
retention
and
some
lacing
smell
is
weak
the
only
really
detectable
thing
i
can
find
is
yeast
and
bread
it
almost
smells
belgianish
taste
is
of
some
malt
some
caramel
but
with
a
somewhat
sharp
alcohol
bite
towards
the
end
moutfeel
was
very
light
and
watery
it
just
seemed
off
overall
this
beer
was
just
very
bland
in
all
aspects
smell
taste
moutfeel
ect
it
wasnt
terrible
but
i
will
not
revisit
this
and
by
far
the
worst
winter
warmer
ive
yet
to
sample
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
but
nothing
terribly
exciting
or
special
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
be
displeased
to
drink
it
either
beer
poured
a
mahogany
brown
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
nose
is
of
malts
and
baked
holiday
sweets
taste
is
of
malts
that
have
been
lightly
toasted
and
is
somewhat
bready
hops
come
into
play
late
and
ever
so
slightly
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
average
for
the
style
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
just
has
something
about
it
that
is
hard
to
explain
but
is
very
tasty
overall
an
average
christmas
beer
the
right
flavors
but
not
enough
kick
overall
just
an
average
christmas
offering
nothing
to
seek
out
but
glad
to
try
it
will
not
look
for
it
next
year
but
if
i
happen
to
come
across
some
i
will
definitely
give
it
another
shot
d
tried
this
one
on
a
whim
damn
that
pretty
label
beckoned
me
so
im
not
too
disappointed
this
beer
has
its
positive
qualities
but
had
a
fairly
forgettable
taste
this
bottle
says
this
is
about
three
months
old
so
age
isnt
a
factor
maybe
id
get
this
again
better
on
draught
perhaps
finish
is
sweet
brown
bread
and
some
biscuits
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
ring
smells
slightly
malty
and
spicy
but
with
a
little
sour
graininess
as
well
taste
is
similar
including
the
sour
graininess
quite
light
in
overall
flavor
slightly
sweet
and
a
slightly
nutty
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
i
drank
a
sixpack
of
this
and
a
week
later
someone
brought
me
another
i
was
pretty
bored
with
this
before
i
finished
the
first
sixpack
let
alone
the
second
eh
overall
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
isnt
the
best
winter
warmer
out
there
but
it
certainly
isnt
the
worst
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
okay
abv
is
pretty
good
for
this
beer
not
very
noticable
drinkability
is
okay
overall
pretty
good
offering
definitely
worth
a
try
d
notes
overall
this
is
at
best
a
halfway
decent
drinkable
beer
but
not
worth
bothering
with
if
you
are
looking
for
a
truly
good
winter
warmer
this
brew
is
nothing
more
than
a
thin
malt
body
with
some
holiday
spices
the
body
is
much
too
thin
the
maltiness
is
weak
the
finish
is
very
weak
and
this
overall
in
my
opinion
a
not
so
great
winter
brew
drinkability
is
decent
although
its
just
not
a
very
interesting
beer
its
kind
of
odd
and
doesnt
really
call
for
more
than
one
ill
stick
to
the
ipas
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
christmas
spice
but
mainly
cinnamon
in
the
taste
just
like
the
smell
a
sweet
christmas
spice
but
mainly
cinnamon
a
smooth
and
spicy
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
cinnamon
aftertaste
mainly
sweet
cinnamon
hides
the
alcohol
and
easy
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
do
three
or
four
of
these
d
this
is
an
okay
winter
warmer
there
are
better
out
there
but
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
at
any
holiday
gathering
d
its
a
little
sweet
but
its
good
kick
back
and
enjoy
1
or
2
the
bottom
line
a
distinctive
take
on
the
winter
warmer
style
by
the
folks
at
breckenridge
not
amongst
my
favourites
in
the
style
but
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
run
into
it
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
there
is
not
much
of
that
seasonal
flavor
to
it
it
drinks
well
and
i
enjoyed
it
just
not
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
moderately
high
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
as
well
a
decent
amount
of
warmth
in
the
finish
a
nice
festive
selection
but
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
have
liked
this
ones
okay
nothing
to
write
about
really
d
not
too
shabby
easy
to
drink
but
not
especially
challenging
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
in
the
mouth
this
brew
has
a
medium
body
with
carbonation
that
almost
cleanses
the
palate
whileafter
the
brew
is
swallowed
finish
is
on
the
drier
side
slight
warming
sensation
in
the
stomach
after
the
brew
has
been
swallowed
this
isnt
a
hard
brew
to
drink
though
i
much
prefer
glbc
christmas
ale
over
this
one
as
well
cristian
moerlein
christkindl
as
well
d
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
out
of
a
christmas
ale
i
dont
really
see
myself
getting
this
again
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
really
but
nothing
too
impressive
either
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
beer
although
it
does
taste
a
bit
like
the
holidays
i
bought
this
bottle
at
3
cellars
liquor
in
franklin
wi
d
thought
i
had
establised
a
list
of
staple
holiday
brews
but
like
the
bcs
one
underdogs
victory
throws
the
whole
ranking
system
into
chaos
loved
the
brew
would
definately
buy
agian
i
was
mixing
up
a
sixer
and
figured
why
not
give
this
a
chance
nice
dark
malty
beer
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
kick
this
was
actually
at
the
bottom
of
my
winter
warmer
list
this
beer
was
just
average
i
will
still
give
breckenridge
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
the
future
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
reddish
tint
head
is
a
creamy
and
thick
2
light
brown
head
smell
is
a
doughy
sweet
malty
scent
with
some
spices
cinnamon
gingerbread
taste
is
mostly
on
the
spice
with
a
little
bit
watered
down
decent
beer
for
a
winter
warmer
a
nice
well
hopped
spicy
winter
warmer
i
probably
wouldnt
want
too
many
at
one
time
but
a
couple
certainly
hit
the
spot
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
chimay
chalice
poured
a
mahogany
and
when
the
light
hit
it
it
showed
a
lot
of
ruby
colors
very
little
head
and
carbonation
smells
of
hops
and
malty
sweetness
also
spices
and
citrus
im
guessing
from
the
hops
taste
is
more
simple
then
the
smell
its
mostly
sweet
with
a
little
roasted
malts
and
hops
coming
out
in
the
end
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
a
sixer
in
a
night
but
i
could
definitely
go
for
another
the
bottle
label
was
different
that
what
is
shown
on
the
picture
here
and
i
found
it
better
looking
the
beer
itself
looked
mahogany
in
color
clear
and
topped
with
a
one
finger
head
the
smell
made
do
a
double
take
because
the
strong
hop
presence
was
not
expected
at
all
the
citric
smell
was
backed
with
some
toffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
quite
outstanding
due
to
the
amount
of
things
going
on
the
hops
were
noticeably
bright
and
floral
while
the
malt
was
toasty
and
sweet
there
was
a
rich
smoky
backbone
and
a
lingering
buttery
aftertaste
even
with
all
of
this
flavor
density
this
was
not
a
big
beer
but
an
easily
approached
one
a
little
tinny
in
texture
perhaps
but
not
much
given
up
there
either
fantastic
pick
from
windward
beverage
mart
in
alpharetta
at
the
recommendation
of
paz
first
time
to
have
this
one
appears
a
dark
redbrown
in
a
standard
pint
glass
absolutely
no
head
at
all
with
no
visible
carbonation
in
the
glass
unless
provocated
nose
was
pleasing
piney
hops
balanced
with
rich
malts
taste
is
similar
with
some
roastednessnuttiness
tucked
away
in
there
rather
light
mouthfeel
to
it
i
cant
really
decide
where
it
wants
to
go
or
what
it
wants
me
to
think
confusing
aftertaste
is
short
lived
and
lacking
not
the
best
winter
warmer
but
worth
a
try
im
kind
of
disappointed
by
this
one
i
love
christmas
beers
but
im
really
not
that
impressed
by
this
one
this
ale
pours
a
very
clear
deep
ruby
red
into
my
mug
with
a
thin
white
head
the
head
diminished
to
a
thin
skim
that
lasted
through
the
beer
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
moderatelow
roasted
character
a
moderate
malty
sweetnesscaramel
like
with
a
bit
of
spicyness
there
is
also
a
low
flora
hop
aroma
a
nice
nose
to
this
beer
the
taste
initially
malty
moderate
caramel
slightly
nutty
a
little
toasted
and
moderately
sweet
toward
the
swallow
a
moderate
hop
flavor
emerges
very
nice
the
bitterness
is
mediumlow
but
that
combined
with
mediumlow
roasty
flavor
there
is
enough
to
provide
a
nice
balance
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
bodymouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
well
done
christmas
style
ale
a
nice
looking
beer
the
nose
and
flavor
are
both
solid
with
some
complexity
and
the
subtle
but
noticeable
hop
flavor
is
well
done
drinkability
is
very
good
too
especially
at
the
7
4
abv
it
could
sneak
up
on
me
i
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
good
this
is
one
of
my
colorado
native
favorites
in
the
winter
warmer
category
but
at
7
4
abv
you
find
yourself
drinking
less
than
you
planned
the
taste
has
a
good
chocolate
flavour
up
front
with
some
nice
sweetness
from
the
caramel
and
a
light
dark
chocolate
like
bitterness
that
comes
through
in
the
finish
it
also
has
some
roasted
malt
notes
but
i
cant
say
i
tasty
any
of
the
dark
fruit
or
fig
that
i
mentioned
in
my
earlier
review
victims
of
aging
oh
well
its
pretty
nice
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
head
retention
is
good
with
some
nice
ring
after
ring
of
lacing
my
overall
score
for
would
this
sample
wouldnt
be
much
different
from
what
ive
laready
rated
it
bold
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
a
strong
winter
warmer
though
so
be
careful
if
downing
more
than
one
a
nicely
rounded
beer
a
tasty
and
very
well
mannered
winter
warmer
of
a
beer
here
it
shines
by
having
no
rough
edges
and
a
willing
to
please
demeanor
a
recommendable
beer
well
done
a
nice
american
winter
warmer
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
creamy
khaki
head
aroma
consists
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
hints
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
theres
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
also
smooth
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
flavors
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
are
apparent
upfront
piney
hop
bitterness
arrives
midway
and
carries
into
the
finish
obviously
the
7
4
abv
supports
why
its
listed
as
an
american
style
strong
ale
on
breckenridges
website
but
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
hearty
amber
in
my
opinion
i
think
some
of
that
can
be
contributed
to
the
addition
of
the
black
patent
malt
thats
utilized
also
it
definitely
adds
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
to
the
finish
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
a
very
nice
christmas
ale
thats
produced
without
the
use
of
traditional
holiday
spices
pours
out
a
rich
dark
red
with
very
little
offwhite
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
spices
and
bread
it
tastes
mostly
of
the
same
stuff
without
any
real
serious
character
or
flavor
very
little
aftertaste
and
not
much
of
a
hint
of
hops
or
bitterness
nothing
was
offensive
but
nothing
was
great
either
a
little
watery
with
below
average
carbonation
but
easy
to
consume
the
bottle
will
look
good
with
my
other
christmas
season
brews
slainte
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
didnt
drink
so
well
whatever
it
was
i
liked
about
lasy
years
aint
here
either
my
tastes
changed
or
the
recipe
did
not
reccomended
but
had
potential
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
brewed
one
date
area
on
label
that
wasnt
notched
into
a
pint
glass
was
a
brownmahagony
color
with
just
a
very
small
brownish
head
the
smell
was
bready
malts
well
balanced
with
a
spicy
hop
the
taste
was
pretty
good
for
a
winter
warm
but
since
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
can
get
rated
overall
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
had
so
far
recommend
trying
especially
if
you
enjoy
warmers
3
rb
to
they
were
right
its
a
very
tasty
beer
it
has
a
pleasant
aroma
a
great
taste
with
a
hint
of
cherry
i
think
very
nice
beer
i
could
drink
this
stuff
past
christmas
overall
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
worth
a
try
medium
bodied
drinkable
but
not
really
a
session
beer
a
decent
warmer
after
doing
some
fall
or
winter
chores
worth
a
try
pours
a
deep
shade
of
rubyamber
with
excellent
clarity
and
orange
highlights
thin

offwhite
head
shows
passing
retention
and
light
spotty

nose
with
some
background
dark

english
hop
aromas
and
faint
gingercinnamon
notes
roasted
and
caramel
flavors
upfront
followed
by
a
touch
of
honey
and
a
rich
blackstrap
taste
aftertaste
is
dry
and
full
of
fuggle
hop
flavor
with
a
solid
piney
hop
bitterness
more
hoppy
than
the
aroma
suggests
but
retains
a
good
balance
sweet
medium
to
full
body
deposits
plenty
of
residual
sugar
but
the
fine
carbonation
and
abundant
hop
charcter
keeps
the
mouthfeel
more
dry
and
airy
than
cloying
hint
of
gingercinnamon
near
the
end
and
finishes
with
a
mild
slickness
that
fades
quickly
due
to
assertive
hops
and
drying
spices
reminicent
of
anchors
osa
this
drinks
easy
and
makes
a
terrific
holiday
treat
a
good
warmer
big
on
malts
bold
on
hops
and
spiced
just
right
too
often
the
winter
warmers
try
to
overdo
the
spices
making
it
harsh
or
astringent
this
beer
starts
with
a
strong
malt
base
that
takes
on
caramel
toffee
bready
toasty
flavors
and
a
nearlysyrup
body
hopped
for
nice
balance
while
contributing
a
bit
of
citrus
earty
and
pine
flavors
spices
decorate
the
nose
and
flavors
really
subtally
but
never
contribute
harshness
in
the
feel
seems
well
aged
and
matured
with
only
a
hint
of
hotter
alcohols
or
abrasion
still
has
nice
head
retention
and
lacing
with
the
last
sip
not
one
of
breckenridges
finest
brews
pours
brown
with
red
highlight
and
a
off
white
creamy
head
smells
like
malts
maybe
some
roasted
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
im
tasting
cloves
less
malt
then
i
expected
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
there
is
some
alcohol
burn
as
well
i
was
expecting
the
spice
flavors
to
be
more
prominant
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
would
expect
for
a
winter
warmer
this
isnt
bad
and
is
probably
worth
trying
but
i
am
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
youd
be
better
off
picking
up
breckenridges
oatmeal
stout
overall
an
intruguing
yet
alluring
color
and
a
very
pleasantly
balanced
albeit
subtle
taste
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
light
brown
color
with
a
small
head
forming
then
quickly
fading
away
the
aroma
of
malty
sweetness
folowed
by
a
tough
of
spices
and
some
floral
hops
the
taste
starts
with
the
strong
malt
flavor
then
a
combination
of
spices
hit
the
palate
and
then
a
hop
flavor
shows
itself
at
the
end
a
watery
feel
in
the
mouth
is
there
at
the
start
then
it
gains
weight
to
become
more
medium
bodied
towards
the
end
fairly
drinkable
for
a
cold
weather
beer
it
is
faily
refreshing
though
spices
could
be
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
served
with
a
reddish
brown
color
and
a
dense
white
head
nice
lacing
and
head
retention
throughout
the
session
caramel
chocolate
rich
malts
and
some
offscents
in
the
aroma
pretty
poor
flavor
some
off
flavors
ontap
compared
to
the
bottled
version
nonetheless
there
is
some
chocolate
and
caramel
on
the
palate
pretty
full
bodied
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
but
the
off
flavors
were
too
much
to
bare
mouthfeel
is
ok
but

perfumey

odd

sweet
almost
like
the
samples
at

really
sparked
my
interest
the
ale
like
bittneress
and
foaming
feeling
was
good
and
swallowed
with
a
thinner
taste
with
an
aftertaste
that
was
of
malt
and
alcohol
tasting
this
and
putting
it
in
a
winter
warmer
category
it
did
not
seem
right
there
are
so
many
beers
out
of
colorado
and
if
youre
not
coors
youre
making
good
stuff
taste
was
well
malts
lots
of
them
with
a
sweet
flavor
vaguely
like
licorace
with
hops
that
took
backstage
but
made
this
a
well
balanced
beer
for
being
so
powerful
i
would
easily
be
lured
into
having
a
few
and
being
hammered
for
it
this
is
my
favoite
breckenridge
i
have
had
its
thicker
then
most
of
there
beers
and
has
some
flavor

starts
a
little
sweet
some
caramel

finishes
slightly

very
drinkable
this
beer
pours
pale
brown
that
has
no
hazing
and
lies
beneath
a
nice
pillowy
tan
head
the
aroma
consists
of
an
overwhelming
amount
of
alcohol
smell
with
not
much
else
poking
through
the
taste
consists
of
roasted
malts
with
more
of
the
alcohol
that
nearly
make
it
taste
medicinal
it
also
has
a
seltzer
type
taste
characteristic
to
the
finish
of
each
swallow
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
just
doesnt
have
a
lot
going
for
it
its
okay
but
other
than
a
warming
beer
not
my
choice
for
the
holidays
cheers
drinkability
not
a
show
stopper
but
a
fairly
interesting
brew
that
your
mainstreamers
would
probably
tolerate
kind
of
an
overthehill

creature
of
winter
sports
a
rich
amber
colour
that
leans
into

on
the
real

the
nose
weilds
a
sharp
solvent
dagger
that
reminds
me
of
urinal
cakes
pissy
scents
too
strangely
candy
fruity
and
jons
to
goish
the
flavour
is
ground
up
sugar
plum

and
solvent
feels
like
artificial
flavours

bit
of
frankinsense
psych
let
her
sit
a
bit
the
nose
never
gets
better
the
taste
however
is
quite
an
improvement
dark
fruits
sugar
pepper
and
anise
the
finish
is
somewhat
flowery
like
that
of
a
heather
beer
bizarre
in
that
unpredicatable
winter
warmer
way
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
or
there
abouts
somewhat
slick
and
syrupy
drinkability
is
troubling
you
could
probably
buy
one
bottle
and
pour
everyone
in
the
family
a
thimble
full
at
christmas
time
and
it
would
most
likely
be
enough
or
more
than
enough
in
some
instances
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
challenge
for
some
reason
ill
try
it
again
next
holiday
season
this
is
a
nice
rather
easy
to
drink
high
abv
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
id
definitely
get
it
again
d
just
ok
not
much
there
overall
the
2005
version
of
this
winter
warmer
poured
a
dark
orange
color
into
my
glass
left
a
creamy
slight
head
that
didnt
stay
around
very
long
i
was
encouraged
by
the
sweet
hoppy
almost
peppery
scent
that
i
detected
tasted
a
blending
of
hops
and
malt
flavors
which
unfortunately
nearly
cancelled
each
other
out
had
a
pleasant
light
carbonation
but
a
disappointingly
thin
mouthfeel
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
one
that
ill
reach
for
again
given
the
plethora
of
quality
holiday
beers
that
are
now
available

so
of

dissipates

of
caramelly

and
some
nutty

taste
is
decent
caramel
with
spices
i
taste
some
anise
which
i
dont
particularly
care
for
and
maybe
cardamom
there
is
a
piney
hop
flavor
up
front
followed
by
the
nutty
maltiness
not
so
drinkable
alcohol
is
evident
as
it
warms
its
a
good
christmas
ale
but
not
an
exceptional
example
of
the
style
id
pick
something
else
if
available
12
ounce

almonds
pine

cooked

is
nice
up
front
but
its
quickly
ruined
by
a
cooked

the
finish
is

this
beer
has
some
nice
malty
flavors
but
there
are
also
some
nasty
offflavors
the
result
is
a
mediocre
winter
warmer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nicely
bodied
and
refreshing
winter
warmer
that
was
spiced
just
right
but
which
was
otherwise
rather
nondescript
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
though
i
wont
buy
a
sixer
this
holiday
season

character
with

flavor
is
a
little
weak
i
get
a
pine
and
big
caramel
character
but
it
doesn
grab
and
stay
like
i
expect
it
to
just
okay
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
just
an
okay
winter
warmer
id
like
a
more
complex
brew
the
sweetness
just
seems
to
be
the
focus
and
there
is
a
lot
more
that
can
come
in
a
winter
brew
ill
pass
on
the
rest
of
this
sixer
smells
of
spice
like
christmas
but
on
first
taste
tasted
like
a
stout
with
some
extra
thrown
in
yes
i
believe
it
is
its
breckenridges
stout
with
a
few
extra
ingredients
to
make
it
look
like
a
christmas
ale
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
consistency
is
almost
like
water
thats
good
and
bad
one
would
desire
a
thicker
mouthfeel
but
on
the
other
hand
the
thinness
makes
one
think
of
colorado
mountain
water
hopefully
thats
what
they
use
at
least
its
easy
to
drink
alcohol
was
well
concealed
was
this
years
still
7

very
drinkable
the
color
is
a
clear
chestnut
brown
with
a
creamy
lightbrown
head
of
average
height
the
aroma
is
weak
but
not
unpleasent
an
herbal
hop
smell
is
most
notable
atop
a
sweet
toasted
malt
body
the
taste
of
this
beer
screams
american
brown
ale
not
winter
warmer
the
malt
body
is
toasted
with
dark
caramel
flavors
everywhere
the
overall
flavor
is
more
sweet
than
rich
a
mild
herbal
hop
flavor
bounds
about
throughout
a
sip
breckenridge
christmas
works
well
as
a
brown
ale
nothing
spectacular
and
despite
a
high
abv
this
isnt
a
winter
warmer
overall
a
beer
that
looks
spectacular
but
falls
off
soon
after
it
hits
your
mouth
cool
looking
bottle
but
the
contents
didnt
excite
me
a
good
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
for
the
holidays
to
serve
to
notsoclose
friendscompany
glad
i
only
bought
one
bottle
for
1
50
great
label
on
this
bottle
like
an
old
christmas
card
from
your
grandparents
attic
poured
a
dark
chestnut
with
so
little
carbonation
evident
on
the
pour
that
i
was
afraid
for
a
moment
that
id
gotten
a
flat
bottle
after
a
second
though
a
thin
sheen
of
lace
appeared
characteristic
of
a
winter
warmer
with
substantial
malt
and
reserved
caramel
and
roasted
flavors
there
was
some
indescript
spice
flavor
in
the
background
but
seemed
to
be
yeastproduced
rather
than
a
spice
adjunct
not
bad
but
a
bit
too
timid
to
satisfy
my
expectation
for
the
style
i
think
this
falls
somewhere
in
between
snca
and
osa
with
characteristics
of
each
unfortunately
this
one
just
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
like
those
other
superior
brews
notes
winter
warmers
really
arent
my
thing
still
this
is
a
finely
crafted
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
yucky
ohio
late
winter
day
id
recommend
trying
it
at
least
once
this
is
okay
nothing
special
something
about
this
beer
just
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
i
had
a

although

a

brew
to
warm
up
with
on
a
cold
winters
night
yeah
i
can
drink
it
but
its
nothing
to
shout
about
pours
out
to
a
nutty
brown
clear
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
smelled
lightly
of
alcohol
light
spiced
scents
alcohol
was
very
present
in
the
flavor
along
with
some
thin
cinammon
and
gingerbread
flavors
pretty
sweet
but
not
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
that
i
have
had
kind
of
dissapointing
there
are
many
better
beers
than
this
one
trick
pony
overall
impression
decent
winter
beer
with
some
nice
spice
flavors
but
drinkable
enough
that
you
can
drink
more
than
one
a
clear
rubychestnut
body
rests
gently
beneath
a
short
creamy
head
of
light
tan
that
drops
slowly
to
a
thin
surface
covering
leaving
tiny
spots
and
splashes
of
lace
about
the
glass
its
quite
smooth
and
even
somewhat
creamy
across
the
palate
with
a
medium
dextrinous
body
and
finebubbled
moderate
carbonation
thats
quite
british
in
character
the
nose
is
inviting
and
quite
interesting
with
interwoven
notes
of
carameldrizzled
and
biscuitybready
malt
dark
dried
fruits
prunes
and
raisins
and
pine
the
flavor
follows
suit
and
its
a
fairly
rich
and
somewhat
complex
brew
with
a
beautiful
biscuity
and
toffeeish
malt
component
thats
accented
by
yeasty
fruitiness
and
a
dollop
of
rounding
buttery
diacetyl
its
reminiscent
of
the
fullers
yeast
character
and
its
very
english
indeed
as
it
warms
the
hops
become
more
apparent
leafy
grassy
and
slightly
minerallike
leaving
it
to
finish
with
some
lingering
buttery
toffee
and
drying
leafy
and
resinous
hops
an
excellent
beer
that
delivers
exactly
what
id
expect
of
an
english
brewed
winter
warmer
definitely
worth
trying
feel
is
close
to
medium
approaching
thin
definately
empty
and
nearly
depleted
of
anything
that
would
perhaps
help
this
concoction
no
sir
i
didnt
like
it
pours
out
a
very
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
alot
like
a
barleywine
aroma
is
highly
reminiscent
of
a
brown
ale
with
a
chocolatey
nose
up
front
and
some
malt
and
a
strange
lemony
zest
in
the
background
this
is
a
very
different
winter
ale
it
tastes
and
feels
alot
like
stones
8th
anniversary
brown
ale
sans
lemon
zing
i
really
enjoy
the
chocolatey
taste
up
front
but
the
lemony
zing
in
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
unwelcome
quite
drinkable
for
a
beer
this
big
and
a
very
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
if
you
dont
like
snca
then
this
may
be
for
you
ill
stick
to
my
hops
thank
you
good
but
unremarkable
winterchristmas
beer
poured
with
virtually
no
head
decent
carbonation
though
that
saves
the
mouthfeel
aroma
is
hoppy
with
some
spicing
and
alcohol
taste
is
slightly
spicy
with
prunes
raisins
and
ripe
fruit
present
none
of
the
tastes
really
jump
out
and
take
over
mouthfeel
seems
a
tad
thin
very
drinkable
smooth
nonoffensive
beer
would
make
a
good
introduction
into
spicedwinter
beers
for
a
skeptic
but
i
like
my
beers
to
jump
out
at
me
personally
clear
mahogany
thin
beige
head
with
little
retention
lacing
is
spotty
and
sparse
some
faint
sweet
malt
aromas
and
a
bit
of
a
spicy
hop
presence
if
you
sniff
hard
enough
body
is
almost
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
kind
of
there
the
flavors
are
nice
enough
sweet
malts
and
dark
fruits
blend
nicely
raisin
and
plum
come
to
mind
a
little
piney
character
and
theres
a
slight
lingering
bitter
dryness
after
the
swallow
pretty
good
winter
warmersin
my
mind
at
leastshould
be
mediumfull
subtly
carbonated
creamy
slightly
sweet
and
mildlymoderately
spiced
with
an
abv

the
high
side
to
encourage

arguably
highish

breckenridge
christmas
ale
fails
on
all
counts
i
havent
been
particularly
impressed
by
any
beer
from
this
brewery
and
this
one
has
done
nothing
to
change

mind

impression
rounds
to
a
lush

with
a
peach
sense
a
little
sweet
overall
but
a
good
and
festive
brew
with
a
number
of
individual
and
subtle
flavors
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
there
are
so
many
other
seasonals
i
would
rather
drink
first
a
clear
dark
toffeebrown

with

give

not

final
thoughts
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
i
put
together
for
the
holiday
season
so
far
just
middle
of
the
pack
12
ounce
bottle
old
style
label
with
no
date
markings
on
the
side
this
one
wasnt
too
bad
it
was
very
bland
when
it
was
cold
but
got
better
as
it
warmed
it
had
tastes
of
various
fruits
mostly
plums
and
such
but
also
had
a
hint
of
peach
it
also
had
some
different
spices
intertwined
in
it
couldnt
really
point
them
out
though
the
biggest
disappointment
was
the
appearance
it
was
the
color
of
a
bock
but
hardly
had
any
head
at
all
the
small
head
fizzed
out
to
an
almost
nonexistent
laceing
its
not
great
buts
its
not
the
worse
christmas
ale
ive
had
give
it
a
shot
if
you
like
overall
impression
1
bah
humbug
just
didnt
lift
my
spirits
the
flavor
is
too
mild
the
alcohol
too
pronounced
the
spices
too
subtle
id
recommend
looking
into
what
ever
is
causing
the
dms
changing
the
hop
schedule
to
add
some
more
aas
maybe
caramelizing
the
wort
a
bit
to
it
some
depth
heck
go
wild
this
one
needs
a
real
retool
drinkability
easydrinking
but
lacking
in
character
worth
a
try
but
no
need
to
work
too
hard
to
find
the
christmas
ale
poured
reddishbrown
with
very
little
head
the
head
quickly
disappeared
for
the
most
part
leaving
little
traces
the
beer
had
a
slight
malty
caramel
like
aroma
with
hints
of
alcohol
pretty
subtle
overall
it
tasted
a
little
spicy
with
a
big
hoppy
finish
it
was
pretty
fullbodied
with
a
slight
metallic
feel
overall
not
as
impressive
as
i
was
expecting
i
normally
like
a
spicier
christmas
ale
not
impressed
by
this
one
hopefully
next
years
will
be
better
hmm
christmas
in
september
when
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
had
a
very
small
sized
tan
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
fully
diminished
the
body
was
carbonated
and
clear
with
a
reddishbrown
hue
the
nose
consisted
of
malt
caramel
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
that
of
caramel
slightly
sour
and
tart
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
it
had
a
smooth
mouthfeel
watery
dry
finish
and
medium
bodied
there
was
good
lacing
with
this
beer
this
is
a
decent
winter
beer
worth
getting
a
sixpack
of
its
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
too
but
when
stacked
up
against
the
best
strong
ales
it
is
only
slightly
above
average
i
like
though
cant
say
this
legendary
brew
wowed
me
much
pours
dark
brown
reddish
highlights
good
clarity
the
head
was
surprisingly
minimal
poor
retention
some
spotty
lace
the
nose
seemed
too
clean
but
there
is
a
healthy
dose
of
toasted
sweet
malt
straightforward
taste
malty
sweet
yet
bitter
plenty
of
alcohol
to
warm
the
soul
on
a
cold
night
overall
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
not
a
must
try
but
dont
stray
away
from
it
either
pours
out
a
deep
dark
ruby
color
a
hard
pour
produces
an
thin
brown
head
surprising
enough
it
does
leave
a
nice
lace
as
you
drink
it
aroma
of
chococaramel
malt
with
fresh
northwest
hops
caramel
malt
flavors
ride
an
oily
and
buttery
mouthfeel
straight
down
my
throat
seems
too
slick
citric
hop
flavors
are
there
and
gone
too
it
needs
more
carbonation
or
something
lots
of
body
and
hoppiness
is
lost
because
there
is
nothing
to
hold
it
up
high
abv
is
apparent
but
succinctly
masked
they
slide
down
way
too
easy
for
such
a
high
abv
and
im
sure
theyre
even
more
potent
in
the
rarified
air
of
colorado
the
body
is
deep
brown
with
a
good
head
that
lasts
fairly
well
there
are
aromas
of
hay
lemon
and
molasses
the
flavor
is
dark
but
not
thick
the
malt
is
wood
and
molasses
it
is
sweet
and
meaty
but
not
heavy
or
chewy
dark
garnet
hue
w
excellent
clarity
the
beige
intially
thick
head
settles
into
a
thin
spotty
layer
that
coats
the
rim
of
the
glass
dark
caramel
sweetness
and
bready
malt

aromawise
followed
by
drying
biscuit
and
mild
diacetyl
butterscotch
trace
chocolate
malt
lightly
earthy
fuggles
hop
nose
and
fruity
esters
lend
an
overall
british
aroma
profile
rich
dark
caramel
coupled
with
biscuit
malt
lends
an
toffeeish
sweetness
initally
in
flavor
then
mellow
diacetyl
surfaces
and
provides
richness
although
the
hop
bitterness
is
mild
a
pleasantly
dry
nutty
cracker
like
maltiness
assists
in
offsetting
the
malt
sweetness
moderately
bodied
and
smooth
in
mouthfeel
due
to
both
ample
residual
dextrins
and
low
relative
carbonation
perhaps
a
touch
oily
the
earthy
hop
flavor
mirrors
that
of
the
aroma
but
is
present
at
a
lower
level
finishes
sweet
w
hints
of
burnt
malt
rustic
breadiness
coats
the
palate
with
an
exhale
breckenrige
xmas
is
a
well
above
average
and
tasty
winter
brew
a
bit
high
in
diacetyl
but
that
seems
to
complement
the
dark
caramel
character
it
was
a
steal
for
me
at
4
99
a
sixer
this
stuff
is
pretty
strong
too
2
or
3
sitting
around
the
christmas
tree
will
make
you
see
reindeer
or
elves
running
around
your
living
room
good
stuff
ill
be
buying
it
again
this
stuff
knocked
my
socks
off
i
was
really
surprised
at
how
good
this
tasted
with
a
rich
dark
color
and
full
flavor
this
will
definitely
catch
up
to
you
after
a
few
in
front
of
the
fireplace
sweet
malty
taste
and
a
long
mellow
finish
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
with
moderate
lace
aroma
of
chocolate
and
caramel
predominates
chocolate
and
then
burnt
caramel
dominate
the
palate
with
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
strong
alcohol
taste
quite
warming
not
as
much
character
as
some
winter
beers
i
have
tried
but
certainly
decent
and
very
potent
this
is
a
lovely
winter
warmer
it
is
substantial
dark
combination
of
chocolate
coffee
and
dark
fruits
winterbaun
errs
on
the
side
of
bitter
bakers
chocolate
and
hops
rather
than
sweet
there
is
a
nice
boozy

that
provides
a
warming
finish

malty
and
sweet
almost
like
a

nice

at
the
end
very
tasty
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
reminiscent
of
an
english
brown
ale
with
some
german
doppelbock
overtones
the
plum
and
prune
notes
are
a
bit
strong
for
me
giving
a
cloying
impression
resulting
in
the
taste
category
being
its
lowest
score
for
me
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
that
is
less
nutty
slightly
more
hoppy
and
just
a
little
less
impressive
than
downtown
brown
in
my
opinion
o
not
exactly
what
i
expected
but
quite
nice
got
pretty
hard
to
drink
by
end
lets
cut
to
the
chase
this
beer
is
basically
liquid
dark
chocolate
its
got
slight
hits
of
coffee
but
the
taste
of
chocolate
overpowers
it
i
like
the
founders
style
bottle
and
the
picassoish
label
art
great
beer
ive
bought
it
twice
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
it
again
o
a
nice
example
of
a
brown
ale
with
some
really
nice
winter
flavors
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
definitely
consider
grabbing
it
again
overall
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
which
is
saying
absolutely
nothing
so
ill
put
it
this
way
its
a
great
beer
nice
and
wintery
and
the
nutty
malt
serves
as
a
nice
backbone
for
the
wintery
style
recommended
overall
a
good
winterwarmer
this
beer
is
close
to
being
great
rather
enjoyable
overall
great
full
body
and
very
thick
sweet
finish
a
prevailing
molasses
flavor
and
texture
some
spiciness
on
the
finish
as
a
little
chocolate
but
a
very
overall
thick
and
sweet
beer
lost

this
is
a
very
confused
beer
not
quite
sure
whether
it
is
an
amber
or
a
stout
and
not
quite
sure
it
is
proud
or
ashamed
of
its
high
alcoholcontent
the
aftertaste
is
all
stout
chocolatey
and
vaguely
coffeelike
but
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
head
lackluster
the
color
of
the
beer
itself
is
a
very
dark
red
and
it
tastes
just
like
it
looks
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
for
getting
drunk
i
was
gone
faster
than
i
anticipated
and
the
taste
was
in
all
honesty
above
average
great
beer
to
buy
on
sale
but
not
something
to
look
for
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
drinkable
flavorful
malty
beer
it
is
a
great
representation
of
a
winter
seasonal
great
job
lost
coast
this
one
went
down
the
tubes
really
fast
thin
and
watery
sour
astringent
like
sucking
on
aspirin
not
refreshing
at
all
this
will
be
a
chore
to
finish
the
whole
sixer
maybe
the
recipe
does
need
to
change
avoid
this
one
overall
i
could
session
this
beer
all
day
which
at
8abv
is
impressive
very
enjoyable
though
nothing
special
o
i
like
it
would
have
again
recommended
taste
is
nutty
and
sweet
with
a
tang
of
bitter
in
the
middle
just
realized
its
8
abv
the
higher
the
abv
the
more
the
tendency
to
stress
the
flavor
a
bit
considring
that
i
think
they
did
a
great
job
on
this
brew
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
easily
overlooked
there
is
a
certain
earthiness
to
the
nutty
flavor
and
this
is
a
beer
i
could
easily
drink
in
succession
overall
if
you
can
find
it
on
sale
its
well
worth
a
look
otherwise
there
are
plenty
of
better
brown
ales
out
there
8
abv
is
very
well
hidden
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
pronounced
straight
forward
flavors
perfect
beer
to
help
warm
up
for
the
colder
season
highly
recommended
for
someone
in
need
of
a
change
of
pace
from
heavy
imperial
stouts

its
officially
winter
time
to
stop
procrastinating
on
the
massive
amount
of
winter
beers
ive
stocked
up
on
winterbraun
pours
out
a
great
clear
brown
with
a
very
nice
looking
large
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
some
dark
fruits
the
taste
offers
more
of
the
roast
chocolate
and
fruits
from
the
nose
along
with
a
solid
boozy
kick
and
some
earthy
malts
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
too
light
for
the
booze
factor
that
the
flavor
offers
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
winterbraun
is
a
solid
winter
seasonal
that
offers
something
thats
a
bit
different
from
the
pack
of
overspiced
ales
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
i
like
almost
everything
the
lost
coast
brewery
puts
out
a
masterful
winter
brew
from
humboldt
county
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beerthe
chocolate
malts
work
wonders
on
my
tongue
and
all
i
want
to
do
is
drink
more
and
moreeasy
smooth
and
flavorful
one
of
these
isnt
enough
and
six
would
send
me
caroling
through
the
streetslet
this
one
sit
at
room
temp
out
of
the
fridge
for
10
minutes
or
so
before
opening
to
find
tons
more
flavor
and
aromathe
only
thing
that
holds
this
back
from
being
exceptional
is
the
lack
of
head
retentioni
like
beers
that
do
leave
a
little
fluff
on
the
mustache
i
dont
really
have
one
but
you
get
the
ideahighly
recommended
for
a
sitaround
with
friends
while
opening
those
festive
gifts
or
just
chatting
it
upyum

all
in
all
it
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
like
brown
ale
for
the
price
it
is
a
relatively
inexpensive
and
drinkable
strong
brown
beer
overall
good
brew
and
its
a
kick
in
the
pants
vs
your
more
traditional
english
brown
does
well
to
hide
the
8
good
balance
yes
i
believe
this
one
will
have
to
be
had
again
but
theres
so
many
beers
and
so
little
time
and
money
t
prominent
chocolate
malts
carameltoffee
sugars
and
a
slight
hops
bitterness
lingering
caramel
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
until
the
beer
warms
adding
a
bit
more
character
and
a
hint
of
almond
overall
inoffensive
and
limited
palatewise
a
good
but
not
exceptional
beer
id
drink
one
again
if
somebody
else
were
buying
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brown
ale
full
bodied
and
you
can
really
taste
that
in
the
mouthfeel
nice
chocolatymalty
taste
and
enough
body
to
make
this
good
for
the
winter
not
hoppy
so
dont
look
for
that
as
you
would
some
other
winter
beers
but
its
got
enough
to
make
it
crisp
and
not
too
malty
all
in
all
a
good
beer
id
drink
another
a
pretty
decent
dessert
beer
gonna
have
to
try
it
with
a
scoop
of
french
vanilla
ice
cream
overall
not
a
great
winter
warmer
since
not
only
is
the
body
thin
but
it
has
bittering
hops
and
just
mild
flavors
of
any
roast
or
chocolate
flavors
pass
o
good
brew
lost
coast
does
well
not
a
bad
beer
overall
nice
chocolate
taste
smooth
and
consistent
very
drinkable
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
brown
i
enjoyed
it
overall
a
little
different
than
others
in
the
genre
fairly
full
feel
with
a
fairly
complex
flavor
o
to
me
this
beer
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
thrown
in
the
flavors
were
good
but
for
the
most
part
it
did
come
off
like
it
was
almost
a
porter
to
me
id
probably
only
have
about
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
okay
brew
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again

a
clean
deep
amber
to
brownish
color
with
a

in

a
light

malt
in
the
taste
a
mix
of
caramel
and
roasted

a
nice
ending
with
a

a
smooth
and
medium
bodied

sweetness
in

aftertaste
a

sweet

nice
hop

the
beer
a
surprisingly
tasty
brown
ale
from
a
brewery
ive
never
tried
before
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
other
beers
now
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
great
brown
ale
to
enjoy
during
the
winter
i
wouldnt
even
mind
this
yearround
big
three
finger
plus
head
of
dark

fairly
whipped
up
and
airy

streak

there

all
this

to
stay

have
a

give
it

glues
itself
to
the

very
dominant
the

a

the
breakfast

counterbalanced
by

in

sweetness
more
than
the
whole
delivers
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
and
makes
for
improved
drinkability
roastiness
present
throughout
but
restrained
not
much
not
to
like
here
overall
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
at
6
5
sweetness
matches
any
bitterness
i
wouldnt
want
a
6
pack
but
one
bottle
is
worth
it
dark
brown
in
color
slightly
red
hue
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
tan
and
a
little
thin
but
this
is
a
fine
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
burnt
grass
and
medicinal
character
some
background
herbal
hops
but
mostly
a
bready
toastlike
maltlike
smell
the
taste
is
balanced
with
a
malt
backbone
not
much
here
thats
overwhelming
a
bit
thin
but
nice
maltcandy
and
spice
qualities
some
grain
all
in
all
this
one
is
just
okay
o
this
is
a
great
winter
session
beer
waming
and
easytasty
to
drink
not
crazy
complex
but
good
i
like
it
a
common
style
with
a
bit
of
holiday
spice
flavor
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
beige
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
chunky
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
cocoa
and
some
slight
vanilla
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
and
roasted
malt
caramel
and
cocoa
powder
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
crisp
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
i
can
see
why
this
is
released
as
a
winter
beer
like
some
other
reviewers
i
too
must
note
with
a
little
chagrin
that
when
you
purchase
a
winter
beer
you
dont
always
know
what
you
are
going
to
get
this
beer
is
beautiful
to
look
at
and
tastes
really
great
but
i
would
call
it
a
brown
ale
or
a
light
stout
or
something
else
its
great
but
if
you
are
expecting
a
spicy
winterfest
type
beer
you
may
be
disappointed
a
light
chocolate
stout
perhaps
o
a
great
christmas
beer
just
a
really
clean
tasting
beer
very
sessionable
and
great
for
a
christmas
party
so
far
only
second
to
jubelale
well
see
how
well
anderson
valley
and
anchor
winter
beers
keep
up
another
yearly
goto
winter
ale
for
me
onothing
too
offensive
and
nothing
spectacular
average
all
the
way
this
tastes
like
a
not
too
robustnot
too
mild
brown
it
is
well
crafted
and
decent
for
the
style
better
than
many
an
english
english
brown
but
i
dont
like
these
im
getting
heartburn
from
it
i
will
try
to
not
buy
this
again
i
wish
it
were
slightly
spiced
i
would
recommend
doing
this
yourself
my
spice
shelf
is
a
big
mess
and
i
couldnt
find
any
o
good
stuff
pleasant
surprise
my
bears
continue
to
rock
it
on
the
field
hopefully
theyll
do
the
same
by
housing
another
potentially
good
beer
this
one
pours
a
hazy
sunset
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
rich
caramel
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
and
a
light
kiss
of
cocoa
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
ginger
nutmeg
and
orange
peel
the
last
one
though
provides
an
awful
lot
of
citrusrindy
bitterness
given
the
small
amount
this
though
does
not
hurt
things
too
much
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
a
pretty
solid
brown
though
the
spices
start
to
become
a
bit
much
after
a
while
not
too
much
thankfully
but
it
starts
to
grate
on
ya
beyond
that
things
are
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
mostly
this
is
some
pretty
good
stuff
i
purchased
a
single
bottle
at
my
local
beer
store
enjoyed
the
smell
and
taste
the
label
mentions
chocolate
twice
and
for
good
reason
the
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
make
this
beer
unique
but
i
dont
get
much
of
the
spicy
hops
it
has
a
very
nice
aftertaste
id
purchase
a
6pack
to
share
with
friends
d
pretty
good
winter
warmer
type
beer
not
too
heavy
on
the
spice
and
big
on
roasted
flavor
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
seem
to
be
at
a
loss
for
words
with
this
review
i
cant
exactly
pinpoint
what
im
tasting
its
a
fairly
plain
brown
ale
that
i
dont
mind
drinking
i
used
to
drink
this
all
the
time
and
passed
it
over
the
last
couple
of
winters
ive
been
missing
out
this
isnt
an
outstanding
beer
but
it
is
warming
and
tasty
and
a
great
cold
weather
brew
picked
up
a
single
of
winterbraun
from
the
binnys
singles
bin
so
this
might
be
close
to
a
year
old
however
it
is
a
great
tasting
brown
ale
the
appearance
is
good
poured
a
brownish
amber
with
good
carbonation
and
ercu
head
that
is
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasty
and
sweet
the
taste
is
a
charred
molassis
that
has
great
balanced
between
all
the
characteristics
there
is
a
slight
acidic
taste
at
the
end
and
the
alcohol
becomes
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
fuller
body
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
overall
the
is
a
good
beer
i
was
a
little
nervous
because
i
thought
the
age
would
do
it
in
but
no
it
kept
well
drink
it
was
pretty
tasty
its
been
a
very
long
time
since
i
have
had
a
base
north
coast
beer
i
should
probably
go
back
to
some
of
them
od
odd
seems
like
it
missed
the
mark
with
the
malt
bill
yeasty
and
odd
imo
too
bland
to
be
interesting
nothing
special
and
not
something
i
would
look
for
again
o
as
the
name
suggests
this
is
definitely
a
warm
hug
on
a
gold
winter
night
just
too
bad
for
me
i
cracked
it
in
the
middle
of
a
summer
heat
wave
pours
a
dark
amber
with
14
head
smells
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
apples
and
malts
tastes
sweet
too
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
what
exactly
is
tastes
like
but
ill
offer
up
apples
and
syrup
as
my
best
guess
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
i
prefer
my
winter
offerings
with
a
little
more
spice
and
alcohol
and
far
less
sweet
not
disappointed
i
tried
it
but
the
future
will
be
winterbraunless
for
me
d
not
a
bad
winter
ale
the
malt
is
very
much
up
front
but
not
excessively
dark
as
it
never
gets
any
browner
then
a
touch
of
molasses
the
yeast
is
there
to
remind
us
that
it
is
brewed
in
semi
british
style
as
are
the
musty
hops
on
the
down
side
it
has
a
kind
of
sticky
cola
sweetness
in
the
finish
and
the
bitterness
is
disjointed
and
harsh
good
enough
but
not
really
any
more
than
that
12oz
bottle
pours
hazy
brown
with
lots
of
sedimentation
in
suspension
kahki
head
aroma
of
wood
caramel
and
cocoa
nibs
taste
is
sweet
with
some
roasty
bitterness
kind
of
like
a
chocolate
tootsie
pop
medium
finish
with
a
slightly
bitter
dry
finish
not
a
bad
beer
considering
i
dont
typically
care
for
the
style
o
this
was
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
it
wasnt
super
complex
but
had
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
each
sip
to
search
through
it
id
gladly
buy
this
again
d
a
really
nice
beer
i
would
go
find
again
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
does
not
getting
in
the
way
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
large
head
nose
is
hoppy
but
with
lots
of
malt
and
a
toasty
note
the
beer
is
a
brown
ale
with
a
rounded
hoppy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
yet
full
of
flavour
not
huge
and
brooding
but
rather
a
fun
brown
ale
that
works
well
at
this
time
of
this
year
this
beer
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
careful
rating
but
its
a
great
drinking
beer
to
have
any
time
the
beer
itself
isnt
the
focus
quite
nice
overall
and
better
to
my
taste
buds
than
pretty
much
any
yearround
beer
from
lost
coast
it
certainly
outclasses
downtown
brown
ive
passed
this
one
over
at
the
local
bottleshop
for
a
long
time
now
mostly
due
to
the
goofy
label
unfortunately
my
bad
as
this
turns
out
to
be
a
lovely
big
brown
ale
and
more
balanced
than
my
illinformed
expectations
quite
easy
to
put
back
the
whole
bottle
and
its
inspiring
in
me
a
desire
to
escape
the
urban
snowscape
for
a
quick
mountain
holiday
this
was
very
easy
drinking
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
english
browns
so
i
dont
know
when
ill
get
back
to
this
one
but
i
could
see
it
becoming
a
beer
i
get
to
have
every
so
often
when
its
out
however
wont
be
the
first
winter
beer
i
reach
for
at
the
same
time
dpretty
easy
drinking
no
frills
brown
ale
a
decent
beer
but
i
have
my
favorites
when
it
comes
to
this
style
that
id
buy
instead
d
overall
a
great
brew
from
the
two
lost
coast
ales
that
ive
had
they
are
some
of
the
best
looking
brews
ive
seen
it
makes
you
look
forward
to
every
sip
knowing
that
it
will
taste
good
overall
a
delicious
english
brown
that
could
pass
for
a
winter
warmer
if
the
nutty
and
roasty
characteristics
were
a
bit
less
prevalent
either
way
without
restraint
i
could
drink
at
least
three
of
these
in
one
sitting
d
a
really
good
drinker
d
nice
spices
and
good
warmth
meh
the
mouth
is
pleasant
with
a
dry
finish
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
but
the
6
5
puts
it
out
of
session
range
for
me
im
glad
i
pickedup
a
sixer
as
this
one
did
not
last
long
in
my
glass
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
tonys
darts
away
in
burbank
poured
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
smelled
malty
and
chocolatey
with
a
little
nuttiness
very
moderate
carbonation
just
enough
for
me
you
can
taste
malt
chocolate
and
carmel
flavors
and
not
much
bitterness
just
enough
sweetness
i
think
the
alcohol
balances
it
out
nicely
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
great
winter
brew
good
medimbodied
mouthfeel
creamy
and
smooth
and
good
drinkability
overall
nice
balance
on
this
beer
d
not
a
whale
but
a
good
solid
beer
i
like
it
pretty
good
beer
poured
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
fluffy
tan
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
very
good
lacing
color
is
a
cloudyhazy
brown
with
amber
highlights
aroma
is
lush
and
an
aromatic
blend
of
malt
cocoa
and
a
bit
of
caramel
and
nutmeats
flavor
is
like
nose
with
the
cocoa
and
malt
really
standing
out
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
good
and
of
medium
length
but
has
notes
of
solvent
drinkability
a
decent
beer
good
offering
but
will
not
seek
again
first
lost
coast
beer
ive
had
drinakability
enjoyable
pleasant
not
what
id
expect
from
a
christmas
beer
but
i
like
it
begins
to
wear
out
its
welcome
mid
bottle
really
was
upper
echelon
brown
and
then
got
really
easy
running
into
thin
i
dunno
what
happened
this
beer
is
good
in
4
oz
pours
but
then
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
it
just
doesnt
excite
me
anymore
what
8
a
6
pack
i
just
cant
imagine
wanting
6
of
these
drinkability
nice
brew
though
for
a
winterholiday
beer
i
expect
something
more
spicy
and
hoppy
however
that
just
does
not
jell
with
the
brown
ale
style
lost
coast
is
going
for
another
great
brew
from
a
great
brewery
very
balanced
and
tasty
maybe
not
exactly
to
style
but
i
found
this
quite
pleasant
and
drinkable
a
little
more
of
a
winter
warmer
maybe
than
an
english
brown
d
very
enjoyable
a
nice
brown
ale
with
a
reasonable
abv
great
sweet
notes
without
overdoing
it
perhaps
a
little
out
of
season
but
still
drinking
fine
as
mentioned
above
nothings
wrong
with
this
beer
and
its
enjoyable
but
dont
wait
until
summer
to
drink
it
d
drinks
good
all
the
way
thru
that
makes
it
seem
like
winter
in
the
summer
overall
a
pretty
good
offering
from
lost
coast
notes
bbcsd0912danm
not
a
great
favorite
but
better
than
my
impression
in
previous
years
d
probably
no
more
than
2
before
the
flavor
becomes
too
overwhelming
warming
with
nice
hops
astringency
note
mediumbodied
light
effervescence
slightly
dry
pretty
good
stuff
though
not
a
standout
a
solid
brew
d
interesting
choice
of
hops
saaz
i
wish
they
would
have
come
out
more
in
the
flavor
but
not
overdone
with
the
chocolate
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
d
i
could
have
one
or
two
its
more
like
a
dessert
beer
for
me
overall
a
very
solid
brown
ale
im
normally
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
i
would
buy
this
one
again
amber

semiopaque

a

slow

nice

a
really
nice
looking
beer
bready

a
bit
of

in
the
nose
some
aromatic
hops
not
overpowering
malts
predominate
taste
is
mostly
chocolate
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
good
hop
presence
but
not
bitter
finish
is
pretty
dry
a
bit
bitter
and
chocolatey
as
it
warms
up
big
carbonated
mouthfeel
a
bit
busy
this
is
pretty
drinkable
not
sure
id
call
this
a
winter
warmer
despite
the
label
but
it
is
a
tasty
hoppy
english
brown
recommended
especially
if
you
have
the
patience
to
let
this
warm
a
bit
so
the
chocolate
and
hops
come
fully
front
and
center
feel
was
very
chalky
with
abundant
carbonation
the
sharpness
faded
to
a
fizz
and
the
beer
finished
dry
not
a
bad
beer
shows
a
clear
mahogany
in
the
glass
with
a
thick
creamy
slightly
offwhite
froth
with
above
average
retention
very
good
lacing
the
nose
offers
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
chocolate
cinnamon

very
light
citrus
hop
aromas
turn
into
flavors
on
the
palate
with
a
good
mouthfeel
slight
alcohol
tingle
decent
hop
bitterness
and
long
finish
overall
a
very
nice
winter
beer
recommended
solid
simple
beer
this
isnt
really
a
great
brown
ale
but
its
still
good
beer
light
chocolate
malt
and
spicy
hops
are
evident
in
the
aroma
the
beer
is
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
creamy
ecru
head
the
flavor
is
a
mish
mash
of
sweet
malt
and
bitter
spicy
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
good
beer
but
not
terribly
interesting
d
this
is
a
good
drinker
that
had
a
few
surprises
on
the
palate
a
pretty
hearty
and
confectionary
beer
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brown
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
mild
dark
malts
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
toasted
brown
malts
and
earthy
bitter
hops
that
leave
a
nice
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
mild
alcohol
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
for
a
winter
day
a
nice
beer
for
gray
fall
weather
its
good
all
around
with
no
particular
weaknesses
clean
with
some
malt
complexity
and
a
good
balance
of
saaz
hops
interesting
enough
for
a
few
pints
and
best
after
it
warms
to
about
cellar
temp
glassware
pint
served
in
straight
pint
glass
i
hate
when
this
happens
this
is
a
beer
i
like
a
lot
from
a
brewery
that
i
like
a
lot
and
sitting
down
for
critical
review
all
i
can
do
is
rate
every
thing
as
average
i
still
like
this
beer
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
i
just
thought
the
actual
rating
would
be
higher
a
beer
worth
trying
and
having
several
is
not
a
bad
idea
just
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
lost
coast
continues
to
make
some
darn
good
beers
and
continues
to
package
them
with
cartoon
laden
labels
and
taps
perhaps
its
just
me
but
its
hard
to
take
them
seriously
when
i
am
embarassed
to
carry
a
goofy
looking
six
pack
to
the
cash
register
maybe
thats
just
my
issue
the
taste
is
similar
rich
toast
caramel
sweetsour
dried
fruit
with
a
tang
some
earthy
leaves
hint
of
chocolate
bread
and
prunes
its
very
nice
wellbalanced
if
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
and
very
drinkable
this
is
one
big
brown
and
leans
in
a
dopplebock
direction
this
ones
not
tasting
particularly
fresh
though
would
be
nice
with
a
meal
edit
it
is
pretty
decent
allaround
brew
that
with
the
right
crowd
i
might
have
another
only
thing
that
holds
me
back
is
the
slight
resemblance
to
the
lost
coast
raspberry
brown
which
was
not
so
good
seeing
as
this
is
the
year
that
winter
seemingly
wont
let
off
its
death
grip
over
the
prairie
this
is
a
well
named
brew
and
certainly
worth
a
try
d
this
is
actually
kind
of
light
for
a
winter
brew
but
all
in
all
i
like
it
and
look
forward
to
it
next
year
feliz
navidad
however
the
more
i
drink
of
it
the
more
i
enjoy
it
and
im
kinda
glad
that
they
didnt
make
it
into
some
bastardized
extreme
version
browns
are
a
bit
of
an
underwhelming
style
and
i
always
say
that
a
good
one
is
hard
to
come
by
check
this
one
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
and
looking
for
something
simple
yet
sturdy

satisfying

drinkability
to
me
its
not
a
big
session
beer
i
think
its
better
as
a
sipper
i
could
take
down
at
least
5
though
not
a
session
beer
being
its
a
little
heavier
but
meaty
enough
to
keep
you
warm
on
a
cool
night
good
carbonation
not
a
bad
winter
beer
d
at
6
5
abv
and
well
rounded
its
not
going
to
be
hard
to
finish
this
but
its
a
sunday
night
so
i
wont
open
another
nice
beer
dark
brownruby
body
with
white
lacing
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
sweet
fruity
little
hints
of
chocolate
maybe
a
little
floral
hops
in
there
as
well
taste
is
very
fruity
i
detect
rasberry
and
toffee
again
hints
of
choclate
in
the
aftertaste
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
drinkability
nice
malty
brown
ale
not
alot
of
hops
in
there
which
is
true
to
the
enlgish
style
very
smooth
and
pleasant
to
drink
english
browns
just
dont
seem
to
do
bigger
as
well
as
some
other
styles
this
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
one
id
buy
again
d
only
a
couple
would
do
me
for
this
one
its
just
way
too
sweet
way
too
thick
and
way
to
spiced
to
be
enjoyable
as
a
session
ale
i
know
that
the
purists
out
there
are
going
to
chastise
me
for
calling
any
winter
warmer
a
session
ale
but
some
do
follow
that
craving
ie
sns
celebration
ale
im
not
regretting
the
purchase
but
im
not
going
to
buy
this
again
this
year
too
many
other
choices
out
there
i
like
lost
coasts
downtown
brown
and
this
is
probably
a
little
better
not
bad
at
all
a
pleasant
brown
no
denying
that
but
not
too
much
character
to
it
either
i
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
it
regardless
and
it
would
make
a
great
intro
or
session
ale
for
the
style
but
not
enough
there
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
personally
overall
a
great
brown
ale
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
not
overly
complex
or
imposing
this
is
a
great
brew
to
simply
enjoy
recommended
the
aroma
was
nice
it
was
a
deep
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
overtones
it
was
full
bodied
and
gave
a
sweet
malt
taste
all
the
way
though
there
was
a
tad
nuttiness
and
a
tinge
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
english
brown
hardly
a
big
beer
the
drink
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
little
lingering
slickness
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
drinks
very
easy
i
like
this
big
brother
of
downtown
brown
quite
a
bit
this
would
be
a
staple
if
regularly
available
d
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
it
didnt
look
so
good
but
the
smell
and
taste
were
quite
good
the
taste
has
plenty
of
the
mentioned
sweetness
but
also
kicks
in
some
hops
for
balance
especially
in
the
finish
slight
alcohol
tinge
doesnt
hurt
the
taste
texture
is
crisp
and
clean
for
such
a
heavy
style
i
dont
love
this
beer
but
its
a
solid
winter
session
brew
and
has
enough
zip
and
originality
to
keep
you
interested

it

not

a

it
defiantly
is
a
winter
warmer
i
found
this
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
easy
drinking
and
timely
a
easy
drinker
and
a
solid
yet
unspectacular
brown
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tubler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
mahoganny
color
it
poured
a
fair
head
that
oozed
coffee
and
hints
of
toffee
mingling
nicely
i
was
excited
however
the
taste
was
extremely
bitter
and
ruff
to
me
the
beer
was
an
odd
mix
that
could
use
some
refinning
a
good
begginning
but
a
ruff
finish
i
will
not
buy
again
d
a
good
brown
ale
from
lost
coast
one
of
their
better
offerings
imo
i
could
definitely
see
myself
having
this
again
a
good
nightcap
for
a
lower
alcohol
beverage
overall
i
liked
this
one
i
love
the
hoppy
christmas
brews
like
celebration
this
is
no
celebration
but
alas
it
is
a
nicely
hopped
drinkable
christmas
brew
d
this
beer
was
not
easy
to
finish
however
i
did
it
didnt
really
smell
or
taste
like
much
of
anything
however
left
me
feeling
a
little
buzzy
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
this
beer
pours
a
dark
redbrown
with
fairly
good
head
formation
aroma
is
somewhat
chocolatey
with
a
bit
of
saaz
hop
aroma
flavor
is
rather
sweet
and
malty
that
i
found
rather
bocklike
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
roastiness
mouthfeel
was
nothing
unusual
but
maybe
a
bit
harsh
in
its
carbonation
recommended
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
thanks
to
talisker
for
the
extra
22oz
bomber

very
dark
looks
like
a
porter
chocolate
head
that
went
down
fairly
quick
s
chocolate

the
finish

coming
through
a
bit
m
lots

it

nothing
incredible
i
may
buy
it
again
this
review
is
from
a
22
oz
bomber
red
brown
in
color
with
a
light
offwhite
head
nose
is
distinctly
chocolate
smooth
on
the
tongue
flavors
of
carmel
and
malts
hops
are
just
right
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
brew
love
that
artwork
on
the
label
way
to
go
lost
coast
altogether
a
decent
but
not
all
that
noteworthy
brown
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
finger
head
that
doesnt
really
last
taste
is
of
roasted
nuts
and
caramel
malts
with
a
similar
although
not
very
noticeable
smell
mouth
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
with
a
semi
sharp
finish
good
drinkability
tis
a
decent
brown
for
sure
just
not
something
im
going
to
remember
really
semirecommended
drinkability
its
okay
nothing
great
but
not
to
aweful
either
little
of
the
sweetness
or
malt
of
a
brown
ale
but
lots
of
what
you
want
in
a
porter
if
you
want
a
porter
a
very
good
beer
depending
on
the
style
you
place
it
in
an
easy
to
drink
beer
because
it
does
nothing
to
offend
its
not
horrible
but
unless
everything
else
in
the
bar
or
store
is
ill
not
be
coming
back
for
this
this
is
a
great
strongerthanusual
brown
ale
its
been
winterized
into
a
substantial
coldweather
warmer
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
lost
coast
yet
d
whereas
i
was
not
disappointed
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
body
and
flavor
d
enjoyable
dessert
type
brew
good
by
average
by
lost
coast
standards
still
worth
a
look
medium
body
nice
and
crisp
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
fairly
light
for
being
such
a
bold
beer
quite
drinkable
i
like
it
hard
to
say
whether
i
like
it
more
than
the
downtown
brown
but
they
are
both
fine
brown
ales
the
winterbraun
looks
plenty
appealing
with
its
rubytinged
brown
hue
and
voluminous
foamy
beige
head
malts
and
spice
are
pretty
easy
to
pick
up
in
the
nose
but
its
hard
for
me
to
identify
anyone
particular
spice
i
also
pick
up
a
bit
of
a
black
tea
aroma
smooth
and
juicy
with
raisiny
caramel
malts
and
a
good
dash
of
coffee
flavors
a
peculier
bitterness
pops
up
in
the
long
finish
with
a
touch
of
bitter
coffee
grounds
more
bitter
than
i
expected
but
still
fairly
easy
drinking
a
good
brown
ale

refreshing
to
see
a

rendition
of
this

as

than
the

i
dont
know
that
this
beer
really
stood
out
from
the
pack
but
theres
not
much
to
dislike
recommended
pours
a
thick
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
1
inch
caramel
head
quickly
fades
with
some
residual
lace
smell
right
off
is
chocolate
spice
and
caramel
taste
is
almost
coffee
like
very
nice
actually
with
a
good
hoppy
after
taste
this
was
very
smoothe
somewhat
thick
but
not
overally
so
at
all
its
seems
very
drinkable
and
i
was
suprised
as
i
usually
do
not
like
darker
beers
but
this
was
very
welcomed
another
worthy
effort
from
lost
coast
i
could
drink
a
couple
or
three
of
these
but
no
more
the
alcohol
i
can
definately
feel
and
they
are
very
filling
taste
is
weak
maltiness
some
sweetness
hints
of
chocolate
and
nuts
with
a
bitterness
that
follows
i
also
tasted
the
alcohol
the
flavors
are
lacking
in
complexity
and
the
carbonation
leaves
quickly
easy
to
drink
moderate
alcohol
content
its
got
a
medium
body
and
a
light
creamy
mouthfeel
a
good
winter
brew
that
certainly
fits
its
style

it

of
the
better
english
browns
i
have
tasted
but
the
style
doesnt
do
much
for
me
chocolate

appearance
with
prominent
licorice

good

carbonated

mouthfeel
a
very
smooth
ale
with
more
sweetness
than
expected
sweet
and
roasted
malts
mixed
well
with
the
english
style
hop
flavors
making
for
a
very
well
balanced
eba
pours
with
no
real
head
just
a
faint
ring
of
tan
foam
its
seems
somewhat
cloudy
but
hard
to
tell
as
the
brown
color
is
fairly
dark
the
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
toasted
chocolate
and
saaz
hops
however
it
only
barely
makes
its
way
to
the
nose
the
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
chocolate
flavor
then
turns
dry
with
a
moderate
nutty
bitterness
the
flavor
didnt
initially
impress
but
it
opens
up
after
awhile
and
does
become
a
bit
sweeter
has
a
slight
thickness
on
the
tongue
and
carbonation
is
good
tasting
more
like
a
porter
i
thought
this
brown
ale
was
very
drinkable
but
i
expected
there
to
be
a
little
more
sweetness
from
the
malt
i
like
this
beer
as
a
winter
seasonal
but
i
didnt
notice
the
spiciness
as
they
claimed
on
the
description
fine
with
me
anyway
i
liked
the
style
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
i
liked
it
and
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
and
i
would
enjoy
drinking
it
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
this
beer
has
a
great
bottle
smell
smells
like
the
homemade
chocolate
syrup
for
ice
cream
my
mom
used
to
make
poured
it
into
a
12
oz
chalice
the
color
is
also
very
chocolatey
the
taste
is
very
chocolatey
surprised
this
bottle
didnt
have
a
nestles
special
dark
wrapper
on
it
this
isnt
what
i
expected
for
a
brown
ale
but
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
flavor
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
very
smooth
and
very
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
pure
chocolate
and
the
beer
is
consistent
throughout
with
a
sweet
finish
i
wonder
if
i
could
pour
this
on
some
vanilla
ice
cream
very
smooth
brew
but
really
sweet
my
new
microbrew
source
grocery
store
had
this
brew
in
a
50
off
cart
should
have
bought
all
they
had
it
would
probably
store
well
pours
a
rather
dull
transluscent
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
thats
gone
quickly
the
aroma
is
a
big
improvement
however
with
nice
chocolate
and
earthy
malt
character
as
well
as
some
grassy
and
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
nice
and
malty
with
chocolate
toasted
bread
and
earthy
flavors
dominating
as
well
as
some
subdued
floral
and
grassy
hops
and
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
and
some
hazelnut
coming
through
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
not
bad
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
an
enjoyable
winter
seasonal
from
loast
coast
subtle
and
rewarding
drinkability
while
i
do
enjoy
this
one
it
will
only
be
occasionally
that
i
endulge
in
it
the
flavors
are
pronounced
and
without
the
hops
i
crave
it
will
be
relegated
to
times
when
i
need
to
take
a
hops
break
after
its
release
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
it
sets
in
the
glass
a
nice
deep
brown
with
a
modest
light
tan
semicreamy
head
that
after
its
dissolving
leaves
a
velum
like
coating
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
nice
malt
sweet
aroma
hints
of
caramel
quite
a
pleasing
nose
i
must
say
start
is
sweet
with
a
nice
grain
presence
top
is
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
is
delectably
acidic
the
hops
delightfully
spicy
and
the
aftertaste
dry
a
decent
winter
beer
and
one
i
always
purchase
as
it
makes
a
nice
end
of
day
beer
cheers
pours
a
hazey
dark
reddish
brown
the
aroma
consists
mainly
of
chocolate
with
hints
of
toffee
and
a
hoppy
finish
the
chocolate
from
the
aroma
mixes
with
coffee
to
make
up
the
body
of
the
flavor
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
this
is
not
an
overly
complex
ale
and
thats
good
it
doesnt
have
to
be
a
damn
fine
brew
to
enjoy
in
those
cold
months

the

very

at
first
it
tastes
like
dark

but
this
contains
some
serious
nesquick
flavors
wintery

are

nice
malts
but
hoppy
enough
to
balance
this
is
sort
of
a
combination
between
a
porter
and
a
wintery
brown
ale
dark
brown
ale
of
light
mustyness
amazingness
this
one
surprisingly
kicked
my
ass
guess
i
am
having
a
weird
night
smoothish
cream
feel
to
the
mouth
very
flavorfull
very
drinkable
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
winter
beers
i
have
had
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
a
well
carbonated
beverage
smell
was
malt
pure
and
simple
with
mostly
caramel
aromas
with
some
toastiness
coming
through
not
much
else
going
on
taste
was
similar
to
smell
with
some
faint
spice
trying
to
come
through
a
little
more
hops
or
some
other
spice
would
probably
do
the
trick
for
me
felt
clean
on
the
mouth
with
lots
of
body
personally
i
could
only
have
one
of
these
as
a
change
of
pace
and
move
on
to
something
else
the
caramel
malt
flavor
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
pours
cocacolalike
with
a
tan
quickly
dissipating
head
good
carbonation
though
smell
chocolate
caramel
and
hazelnut
its
definitely
a
brown
ale
never
had
the
downtown
brown
so
i
dont
know
how
this
compares
but
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
with
a
seasonal
twist
some
added
hoppy
kicks
not
bad
at
all
i
prefer
it
to
the
overpowering
rogue
hazelnut
brown
ale
which
is
excellent
but
too
rich
for
me
to
enjoy
much
of
except
in
particular
moods
after
initial
strong
carbonation
this
has
a
creamy
feel
and
a
pleasantly
chocolatey
flavour
with
just
enough
hops
to
prevent
it
from
being
sickeningly
sweet
this
isnt
something
i
would
want
to
consume
regularly
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
rather
well
done
all
round
i
thought
it
was
a
fairly
decent
beer
although
i
could
only
have
one
maybe
two
twelve
ouncers
in
a
night
not
because
of
abv
as
this
version
is
still
a
solid
but
not
overwhelming
6

pick
up
a
sixer
and
give
it
a
whirl
when
poured
the
color
reminded
me
of
root
beer
the
same
brown
but
not
as
thick
the
smell
of
sweet
roasted
malts
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
but
that
was
the
high
side
the
low
is
that
the
flavor
was
of
a
hoppy
nature
with
no
roasted
malt
taste
not
much
anyway
the
piney
hoppy
flavor
is
not
what
i
expected
in
a
brown
ale
the
aroma
was
great
but
the
flavor
of
a
hoppy
brown
ale
was
a
turn
off
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
reminiscent
of
a
classic
english
nut
brown
with
an
inch
of
slightly
offwhite
head
that
slowly
settles
down
into
the
liquid
the
noise
is
full
of
malts
and
chocolate
both
scents
are
almost
overpowering
the
beer
has
a
strong
initial
taste
of
heavy
malts
and
hazelnut
but
finishes
quickly
and
smoothly
rather
refreshing
but
awfully
light

the
style

murky

with
a

that
barely
eclipses
half
an

tan
in

and
has
the
consistency
of
heavy
cream
not
much
lacing
clings
to
the

more
like

its

just
with
more
bulk
in

this
simply
smells
like
a
bigger
version
of
lost

excellent
downtown
brown
taste
the
use
of
saaz
hops
typically
used
for
pilsners
is
noticeable
right
away
on
the
tip
of
my
palate
mildly
peppery
followed
by
a
steep
drop
into
dark
chocolate
and
some
hints
of
powdered
sugar
the
finish
flows
back
to
the
hops
unique
for
a
brown
ale
spicy
even
tangy
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
but
thats
forgivable
crisply
carbonated
a
bit
different
than
other
winter
warmers
the
chocolate
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
up
also
notable
is
the
use
of
saaz
hops
which
typically
are
associated
with
pilsners
they
add
a
nice
spice
certainly
worth
a

the
taste
has
those

sweet
concentrated

notes
up

and
even
through
to
the
finish
it
is
not
overly
sweet
and
is
even
fairly
light
on
the
palate
though
it
does
have
enough
of
a
richness
and
palate
to
it
that
this
is
appropriate
for
the
colder
months
this
beer
has
notes
of
sweet
plum
fig
there
is
a
mix
between
spicy
hop
notes
with
a
bit
of
citrus
character
thrown
into
the
mix
and
a
bit
of
sharp
carbonation
that
helps
to
balance
the
fruity
sweet
character
the
finish
has
a
light
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
lingering
roasted
astringency
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
the
roasted
notes
begin
to
become
more
noticeable
this
beer
is
nicely
drinkable
and
it
is
complex
enough
that
the
flavor
keeps
me
intrigued
throughout
the
drinking
experience
from
the
fruit
to
the
roast
malt
to
the
american
hop
notes
i
could
perhaps
wish
for
a
bit
more
depth
to
the
malt
character
but
like
i
said
it
is
quite
enjoyable
as
is
note
my
bottle
lists
the
abv
as
6
5
rather
than
the
5
given
by
ba
solid
medium
body
is
the
glue
that
holds
this
one

all
the
understated
flavors
come
thru
and
make
this
an
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
brown
ale
finish
is
firmly
bitter
but
again
the
malt
hangs
in
there
on
the
edges
to
keep
it
in
balance
not
what
you
might
expect
from
a
winter
offering
what
do
californians
know
about
winter
anyway
but
a
damn
fine
brown
ale
no
matter
what
the
season
it
was

color
with

is
good
it
has
a
rich

roasted

with
a

it

the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
really

brown

flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal

and
roasted

it
is
sweeter
than
most

it
goes
down
easy
the

this
is
a

hint
of
bitterness
from
coffee
or
burnt
sugar
taste
is
nice
with
a
rich
cocoa
taste
with
just
enough
of
the
burnt
sugar
and
coffee
backing
it
up
to
keep
the
beer
from
being
sweet
no
really
hoppyness
but
finishes
pretty
dry
maybe
due
to
the
roasted
malts
giving
it
a
bit
of
bitterness
nice
carbonation
and
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
a
bit
above
average
i
would
have
this
again
and
make
it
a
once
and
a
while
beer
but
its
not
something
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
once
in
a
while
while
it
was
tasty
it
was
just
a
bit
rich
to
consume
that
often
the
rich
cocoaish
flavor
of
lost
coasts
winterbraun
should
be
welcome
at
any
time
of
year
its
dark
chestnut
body
appears
a
clear
burgundy
when
held
to
the
light
and
its
creamy
tan
cap
holds
fairly
well
before
dropping
to
a
razor
thin
lid
the
aroma
is
somewhat
subdued
but
wafts
of
cocoa
caramel
and
even
some
verymild
background
hops
appear
its
smooth
and
creamy
mediumfull
body
accentuates
its
maltiness
which
is
caramelish
cocoalike
and
mildly
fruity
raisins
fig
its
laced
with
lowkey
hop
flavors
and
balanced
by
a
restrained
bitterness
that
lets
the
malt
shine
through
yet
still
finish
dry
quite
nice
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
mahogany
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
minimal
laces
it
looks
a
little
thin
it
smells
malty
with
hints
of
coffee
and
fruity
maybe
a
little
nutty
also
it
tastes
malty
with
a
little
chocolate
there
is
a
little
sweetness
to
it
also
it
goes
down
relatively
smooth
there
might
be
just
a
little
too
much
carbonation
it
leaves
a
nutty
aftertaste
i
think
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
there
beers
but
after
a
little
while
i
would
probably
desire
something
a
bit
more
robust
defianatley
worth
a
try
though
overall
impression
nice
brown
with
a
bit
more
going
on
than
most
kind
of
like
a
mixture
of
a
brown
and
a
porter
great
beer
for
winter
or
any
other
time
winterbraun
isnt
very
wintry
other
than
the
daliesque
snowboarder
on
the
label
but
it
is
a
good
english
brown
ale
that
is
helped
by
a
greater
than
usual
amount
of
hops
although
it
has
a
few
minor
flaws
the
bottom
of
the
glass
didnt
take
long
to
appear
the
taste
let
me
down
it
was
too
burnt
tasting
and
the
finish
was
too
thick
and
sticky
on
my
tongue
i
wouldnt
drink
this
one
again
part
of
the
bif
xmas
package
from
shippos
this
beer
poured
out
reddish
brown
with
a
cloud
of
suspended
yeast
particles
in
suspension
the
head
was
about
an
inch
thick
off
white
in
color
and
did
not
hang
around
for
too
long
the
aroma
was
roasty
malt
with
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
like
a
thinned
out
porter
sweet
and
roasty
with
toffee
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
weak
coffee
hops
were
quite
low
in
bitterness
and
mostly
lurking
in
the
background
despite
the
lack
of
complexity
the
alcohol
was
quite
well
hidden
and
the
beer
was
much
easier
to
drink
than
its
strength
suggested
drinkability
ill
pass
on
this
one
finished
it
but
it
wasnt
easy
for
me
though
i
find
it
to
be
entirely
agreeable
i
cant
ever
imagine
having
more
than
one
of
these
over
a
period
of
several
days
its
just
not
that
drinkable
worth
picking
up
definately
as
its
a
quite
unique
winter
beer
but
im
afraid
you
might
be
nursing
that
six
pack
for
the
entire
season
overall
tasty
stuff
i
like
the
brews
from
lost
coast
but
so
often
i
am
blighted
with
old
samples
it
seems
this
is
most
certainly
a
fresh
sample
and
it
shows
how
good
the
lost
coast
brews
can
be
when
properly
presented
a
tasty
winter
brew
worth
seeking
out
mouthfeeldrinkability
nicely
balanced
light
and
well
carbonated
helps
to
make
this
quite
drinkable
its
not
too
thin
to
be
a
winter
beer
but
its
not
so
thick
that
you
struggle
to
get
through
it
i
found
this
quite
interesting
and
it
will
encourage
me
to
try
other
beers
from
this
brewery
disregard
the
awful
label
as
it
looks
like
a
cheap
satire
of
neocubism
and
is
probably
unaware
of
it
own
ugliness
forms
a
slight
tan
head
not
much
remaining
but
a
ring
after
too
long
smells
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
sneaking
in
the
back
door
this
is
a
beer
that
would
be
enjoyable
most
of
the
year
if
it
was
available
i
bought
this
six
pack
on
a
cold
foggy
overall
shitty
day
and
the
next
day
it
was
sunny
and
fairly
warm
both
were
great
days
for
winterbraun
there
is
just
a
little
too
much
carbonation
hitting
my
tongue
to
make
this
more
than
just
a
good
beer
but
it
is
a
welcome
changeup
in
the
winter
seasonal
selection
a
nice

from

big

for

in
my
opinion
very

for

would
be

but
iam
sure
ill
never

though
not

it
is

by
crisp
hops
toward
the
middle
the
bottle
says
saaz
were
used
so
that
seems
to
fit
toward
the
finish
there
is
a
sugary
sweet
taste
the
reviewer
before
me
called
it
a
cakeiness
and
i
would
agree
some
subtle
spicing
too
toward
the
end
overall
nicely
balanced
not
the
most
memorable
winter
beer
ive
had
but
still
a
good
effort
and
would
make
a
nice
beer
to
have
a
few
of
after
a
long
day
out
in
the
cold
didnt
mind
this
at
all
spicy
cookiecakie
flavours
some
chocolate
raisin
with
light
bitterness
some
tart
acidity
pretty
tasty
as
most
things
from
lost
coast
were
this
was
a
bottle
purchased
from
a
shop
in
san
francisco
which
i
cant
for
the
life
of
me
remember
the
taste
is
a
nice
typical
porter
taste
with
a
rather
malty
finish
that
is
almost
nutty
the
hops
are
subdued
but
present
overall
a
nice
well
balanced
beet
that
i
will
enjoy
again
as
soon
as
i
can
find
some
more
it
tastes
like
theres
a
pinch
of
hard
alcohol
in
there
which
i
think
holds
it
back
thats
the
only
thing
holding
it
back
though
deep
brown
without
much
light
brown
head
and
it
doesnt
stay
up
there
too
long
aroma
is
heavily
malty
with
distinct
milk
chocolate
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
nutty
hints
i
could
indeed
mistake
this
smell
as
a
porter
blind
its
got
a
nice
nutmeg
and
almond
bite
in
mouth
coupled
with
dark
licorice
and
a
lowprofile
hop
character
that
leaves
a
boring
unfresh
bitterness
while
aftertaste
is
bready
mostly
dry
and
short
cheers
to
matta
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
very

slightly
surprised
with
the
amount
of
hops
for
a
winter
beer
and
being
as
dark
and
roasty
as
it
is
on
the
nose
its
a
nice
beer
all
around
not
a
ton
of
complexity
although
the
mix
of
caramel
in
the
malt
and
the
bitterness
in
the
hops
does
make
for
a
nice
combination
it
was
just
a
little
short
on
the
complexity
side
this
was
strong
but
never
felt
it
until
i
made
my
way
through
the
beer
itself
the
alcohol
was
wellhidden
and
what
was
noticeable
went
all
with
the
apple
and
skunky
hops
and
lack
of
overbearing
spice
this
almost
reminded
me
of
a
green
flash
beer
but
this
wasnt
as
hoppy
although
the
bitterness
here
was
more
present
than
i
expected
hopheads
looking
for
a
winter
seasonal
will
enjoy
this
as
this
packed
enough
of
a
punch
to
go
with
the
nice
range
of
flavors
that
meshed
well
together
quite
a
nice
surprise
here
this
is
the
third
cisco
offering
ive
reviewed
and
its
one
of
my
favorites
basically
everything
id
want
from
a
winter
perfect
mix
of
smoke
spice
and
cinnamon
more
of
a
smokey
nose
to
it
this
is
my
first
time
trying
a
brag
got
but
if
these
are
the
qualities
of
the
genre
ill
definitely
be
searching
for
more

hue

a
light

it
what
a

we
have
here
well

admittedly
i
am
not
familiar
with
braggots
and
this
style
i
wish
i
was
so
i
had
something
to
compare
to
you
gotta
respect
the
8
abv
but
my
initial
response
is
that
i
would
likely
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future

this

khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
cardboard
musty
pine

stale

and
a
vague
mixture
of

the

goes
headlong

are
still
to
blandly
mixed
together
to
pick
apart
moves
into
wetter
cardboard

finishes
in

and
offputting

this

just
plain
bad
folks
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
i
think
they
tried
a
little
too
hard
with
this
spiced
ale
and
ended
up
falling
rather
short
of
anything
worth
drinking
pure
dreck
it
has
all
of
the
flavor
of
a
good
spicy
beer
but
it
finishes
a
bit
thin
that
might
not
be
a
bad
thing
though
as
its
pretty
drinkable
imho
it
deserves
to
be
upwards
of
80
points
here
its
better
than
some
higher
rated
beers
ive
tried
enjoy
d
not
great
the
malt
is
dark
but
overly
dry
with
a
harshly
toasty
finish
not
much
else
going
on
extra
dry
throughout

leaving

overall
i
think
i
give
up
on
cisco
brewery
so
far
the
only
beer
that
wowd
me
was
their
summer
of
lager
so
i
will
pick
it
up
again
in

gowd
i
cant
wait
for

winter
sucks
cola
like
in

spicy
in

especially
in
the
aftertaste
it
has
a
mild
hoppy
feel
to
it
the
head
is
nice
and
dark
an
interesting
characteristic
is
its
gassiness
which
make
it
easy
to
fall
into
a
fit
of
the
hiccups
light
on
the
aroma
as
winter
beers
go
this
one

we
may

this
is

of

of

hopefully
somone
elses
palate
will
enjoy
it
mine
definitely
wanted
none
of
this
d
a
very
good
beer
a
little
expensive
for
what
it
is
but
its
quite
wellcrafted
i
could
perhaps
get
this
again
if
i
found
it
for
9
99
or
less
im
pretty
sure
it
was
10
99
which
is
too
much
for
a
winter
warmer
overall
a
solid
fresh
tasting
winter
beer
liked
the
hop
flavors
note
big
differences
in
the
rieviews
for
last
years
version
2011
and
this
years
2012
the
mix
of
spices
and
hops
seems
to
give
this
beer
a
brassy
taste
and
palate
the
front
to
finish
of
the
palate
is
astringent
theres
some
good
caramel
and
bready
malt
flavors
in
this
beer
but
they
get
muddled
by
the
spicey
astringent
flavors
and
palate
this
is
a
reddish
frothy
beer
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
herbal
hops
and
some
spice
wood
and
pineneedles
some
earthy
scents
the
taste
is
a
little
astringent
not
really
sweet
hops
play
a
big
part
here
spice
and
grain
grassy
the
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
a
smoothness
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
a
firm
finish
pours
dark
reddish
brown
more
opaque
than
not
14

fizzles

hoppyboozy
is

almost
a
little

in
there
pours
a
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
solid
cap
very
mild
aromas
of
sweet
caramel
malt
some
orange
peel
and
just
a
touch
of
winter
spices
bland
taste
is
similarly
bland
honestly
this
has
zero
recognizable
character
just
malt
maybe
some
hops
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
touch
of
caramel
yeah
super
bland
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
touch
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
decent
carbonation
incredibly
forgettable
not
a
good
beer
o
i
kind
of
enjoyed
this
one
as
it
almost
seemed
like
a
hybrid
of
an
esb
and
a
winter
warmer
though
it
was
not
a
super
easy
to
drink
beer
and
probably
a
beer
that
i
would
not
have
more
than
one
of
during
a
session
this
would
be
best
sipped
after
dinner
by
the
fireplace
as
there
is
too
much
going
on
to
pair
well
with
foods
in
my
opinion
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
good
sized
bubbly
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
mineral
water
licorice
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
earth
the
flavor
is
really
quite
bad
caramel
and
brown
sugar
atop
a
heavy
presence
of
anise
or
licorice
with
a
metallic
earthy
almost
sulfur
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
tart
mouthfeel
i
couldnt
finish
this
one
its
horrible
o
not
a
terrible
beer
but
there
are
definitely
better
examples
of
winter
warmers
out
there
toasted
grain
and
herbal
woody
bitterness
up
front
sweetish
caramel
malt
and

in
and
take

notes
of
gingerbread
and
molasses
mulled

spices
juniper
ginger
and
cloves
around
the
edges
herbal
woody
bitterness
shows
up
again
in
the
finish
medium
body
with
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
not
bad
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
crystal
clear
hazelnut
brown
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
filmy
surface
coating
aromas
of
nutmeg
allspice
and
cinnamon
on
a
subtle
toffee
backbone
with
some
warm
cider
hints
at
the
end
lighter
on
the
nose
than
i
was
expecting
flavors
are
rich
and
roasted
initially
with
a
tangy
toffee
malt
profile
initially
followed
by
a
solid
dose
of
the
previously
mentioned
spices
as
well
as
some
peppery
hops
profiles
sprinkled
throughout
the
liberal
spicing
definitely
provides
the
warmth
in
this
winter
warmer
but
without
overpowering
the
brew
very
solid
backbone
of
malt
richness
to
support
everything
going
on
on
your
palate
tangy
and
spiced
aftertaste
that
quickly
washes
away
for
a
clean
slightly
tangy
finish
that
lingers
longer
than
the
bulk
of
the
aftertaste
itself
smooth
and
round
in
mouth
but
as
it
finishes
you
notice
how
crisp
and
clean
the
brew
is
solid
and
at
a
lower
abv
for
a
warmer
making
this
easy
to
quaff
cheers
i
went
with
my
usual
aggro
pour
which
resulted
in
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
magnificent
deepcopper
with
nequality
clarity
i
once
had
a
girlfriend
with
natural
hair
color
like
that
nose
was
spicy
and
i
want
to
go
with
at
least
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
former
was
easy
to
discern
but
the
latter
because
of
a
vanillalike
sweetness
that
was
also
present
more
than
that
maybe
probably
but
those
were
the
ones
that
i
am
willing
to
mention
without
being
thought
a
pretentious
fool
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
cinnamon
was
immediately
discernible
on
the
tonue
along
with
something
else
not
nutmeg
but
maybe
allspice
whatever
it
was
it
was
highly
spiced
the
finish
as
a
result
was
bonedry
with
the
spices
lingering
well
after
my
swallow
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
might
be
good
but
i
would
not
want
a
steady
diet
of
this
even
on
the
coldest
and
longest
of
winter
nights
oda
winter
warmer
with
some
oomph
behind
it
i
would
probably
not
enjoy
an
entire
sixpack
but
a
bottle
would
do
just
fine
the
spices
are
set
to
a
fairly
high
degree
of
intensity
could
stand
to
use
some
food
around
it
poured
a
1
velvet
beige
head
of
medium
lifespan
the
body
is
dark
burnt
umber
brown
but
held
to
the
light
its
a
very
deep
amber
it
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
the
spices
actuall
smell
savory
taste
mirrors
smell
and
the
spices
come
out
with
warming
ginger
as
well
as
piney
hops
fairly
long
finish
and
yes
this
beer
truly
is
a
warmer
very
good
seasonal
here
probably
because
it
doesnt
go
overboard
on
the
spices
overall
fairly
meh
spices
come
through
a
bit
but
not
a
lot
which
is
nice
if
the
astringent
spicy
earthy
hops
didnt
take
their
place
as
front
runner
when
not
necessary
nothing
seems
to
blend
well
and
its
like
various
components
of
different
styles
all
smashed
together
and
they
hoped
would
get
along
but
instead
the
flavors
clash
o
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
slightly
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
that
i
enjoyed
very
much

from

little

flavor
looking
at
the
previous

i
am
a
little
surprised
at
the
pumple

analogy
certainly
they
are
close
cousins
but
having
had
the
pd
at
the
brewery
and
this
one
in
the
bottle
i
see
a
fair
enough
distinction
and
i
like
this
one
on
its
own
merits
as
well
as
the
pd
this
bottle
opens
with
a
lively
head
tan
in
color
and
a
couple
fingers
thick
it
holds
pretty
well
and
retreats
to
an
impressive
web
of
lacing
my
nose
picks
up
evergreen
and
allspice
and
subtle
cinnamon
and
maybe
a
deeply
buried
chocolate
kiss
over
oranges
and
mellow
roasted
coffee
beans
very
pleasant
and
complex
from
my
experience
perhaps
a
tad
medicinal
to
some
but
i
really
like
this
aroma
the
flavor
is
more
unified
i
think
a
blend
of
toasted
malts
and
subtle
chocolate
coffee
grains
over
evergreen
i
guess
you
might
find
all
the
same
things
that
came
out
in
the
nose
but
it
seems
more
subtle
here
and
highly
drinkable
for
a
holidaywinter
brew
this
presents
a
reputable
medium
body
but
a
bit
more
aqueous
feel
with
gentle
tingly
carbonation
despite
its
opening
emergence
i
think
this
is
a
neat
seasonal
brew
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
another
plus
hit
from
the
nantucket
crew
nice
mf
not
too
full
bodied
but
very
creamy
and
the
flavors
seem
to
linger
for
quite
a
while
a
touch
overbitter
but
still
works
i
love
the
fact
this
isnt
overspiced
solid
brew
could
use
a
bit
of
sweetness
or
breadiness
up
front
to
help
balance
it
long
bitterness
without
any
hop
character
make
this
one
hard
to
session
well
made
no
joke
when
it
comes
to
asserting
its
strengths
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
mildly
spiced
flavorful
and
balanced
definitely
a
nice
winter
beer
to
sip
after
a
long
day
of
shredding
powder
on
the
mountain
ill
certainly
buy
another

as
the
weather
gets

without

an
amazing

need

stock
up
next

with
this
yet
again
another

the

great

well

smell

taste
are

a

contrary

i
found
a

of

taste
improves
as
it
warms
damn
not
everyone
has
the
same
taste
in
beer
i
liked
this
o
drinkable
well
balanced
not
overly
spiced
a
bit
flat
and
not
as
remarkable
as
other
odell
brews
i
had
i
usually
find
this
style
boring
the
the
butterscotch
and
caramel
flavors
explode
in
my
mouth
very
drinkable
great
for
this
cold
minnesota
winter
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
nice
good
and
balanced
very
drinkable
no
particular
flavor
stands
out
which
could
be
a
bad
thing
for
some
people
murky

the

bitterness
full

this
is
a
nice

winter
ale
upfront
hoppy
herbal
bite
dominates
but
as
it
fades
a
noticeably
malty
sweet
note
comes
through
at
the
end
it
became
more
noticeable
and
enjoyable
with
my
second
beer
as
with
most
beer
per
my
friend
d
max
its
fking
tasty
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
consider
this
world
class
the
taste
is
less
than
desirable
for
a
winter
warmer
it
feels
and
tastes
very
thin
however
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
exceptional
overall
3
255
more
along
the
lines
of
an
amber
ale
that
just
happens
to
be
a
winter
seasonal
which
is
exactly
what
the
breweries
intended
to
make
instead
of
an
actual
winter
warmer
either
something
spiced
or
more
of
an
old
ale
anyway
just
an
enjoyable
beer
that
does
not
try
to
be
to
much
maybe
not
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
or
the
winter
releases
i
can
still
find
room
in
my
fridge
for
this
however
overall
a
nicely
balanced
beer
lots
of
contrast
going
on
a
cool
take
on
the
winter
warmer
style
very
interesting
and
well
worth
trying
overall

as
usual
odells
offering
is
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
palate
for
a
malty
winter
warmer
style
this
beer
is
way
over
hopped
i
cant
resist
their
rustic
labels
so
i
keep
buying
their
products
but
they
are
very
hop
based
and
this
one
is
no
different
i
like
the
pale
hops
and
the
caramel
malts
together
they
create
an
interesting
robustness
that
sticks
around
id
probably
have
this
again
on
a
cold
winters
night
tasty
treat
nice
mouthfeel
makes
it
good
for
this
time
of
year
tm
strong
boozy
flavors
with
a
dank
hop
astringency
flavors
are
balanced
but
simple
and
a
bit
onedimensional
almost
too
sticky
for
its
own
good
fortunately
ample
carbonation
cleanses
the
palate
between
sips
i
wouldnt
care
for
this
from
a
cask
finishes
long
and
sweet

really
good
beer
o
wonderful
take
on
the
style
was
actually
looking
for
something
a
bit
heavier
but
this
is
pretty
damn
tasty
pours
a
pretty
dark
amber
in
color
with
reddish
highlights
that
has
a
good
1finger
creamyfoamy
head
that
stays
around
for
awhile
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
which
surprised
me
also
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
consists
of
caramel
malts
toffee
with
spice
more
going
on
with
the
taste
that
ends
with
a
slight
hoppy
finish
but
wasnt
bad
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
a
good
brew
for
the
colder
months
clear
dark
amber
pour
with
an
offwhite

nice
sweet

aroma
medium
bodied
taste
has
flavors
of
caramel
malt
toffee
light
spice
and
earthy
hops
which
add
a
really
nice
balancing
bitterness
my
favorite
winter
warmer
is
isolation
ale
i
know
i
pump
odell
brewings
tires
at
every
opportunity
but
man
they
make
some
excellent
beers
this
one
has
everything
youd
want
in
a
winter
seasonal
plenty
of
flavor
and
actually
not
that
much
alcohol
so
you
can
enjoy
it
without
feeling
weighed
down
by
it
my
only
issue
is
that
its
available
so
early
that
its
generally
sold
out
by
the
time
the
holidays
get
here
maybe
they
could
bump
it
back
a
month
so
it
would
carry
over
in
to
the
new
year
but
thats
just
to
say
get
it
while
you
can
this
beer
is
quiet
theres
a
lot
going
on
but
it
all
blends
so
well
that
the
overall
impression
is
one
of
unified
subtle
but
definite
finesse
this
right
here
is
maltroastgoodolbehindthesceneswizardry
flavor
not
your
rather
more
obvious
hops
mouthfeel
standard
fluffy
english
ale
mouthfeel
fairly
light
bodied
with
a
somewhat
dry
finish
flavor
a
hearty
brew
the
malt
dominates
as
expected
with
those
raisin
caramel
and
whole
wheat
bread
toasted
flavors
leading
the
way
there
is
also
a
moderate
hop
presence
in
the
middle
and
finish
and
a
bit
of
lingering
alcohol
burn
with
the
swallow
delicious
and
well
made
ale
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
foamy
23
and
smooth
13
mouthfeel
that
is
fine
for
the
beer
itself
the
body
a
bit
thin
and
the
carbonation
just
about
right
for
the
style
itself
closes
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
a
pretty
good
beer
although
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
it
a
winter
warmer
tasty
though
overall
good
winter
warmer
beer
not
as
dark
or
complex
as
some
in
this
category
but
its
earthiness
makes
it
ideal
for
warming
up
after
a
day
in
the
snow
andor
mountains
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
more
sweet
than
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
i
have
had
next
to
old
fezziwig
o
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
i
appreciated
the
hop
presence
on
this
one
as
opposed
to
strictly
a
maltcaramel
bomb
yeah
i
could
definitely
do
more
of
these
overall
very
nice
a
winter
warmer
indeed
good
flavor
balance
id
definitely
revisit
this
one
if
it
were
available
around
here
a
straight
ahead
enjoyable
winter
warmer
big
toasty
sweet
and
just
a
little
bit
spicy
and
hoppy
with
a
gentle
alcohol
edge
that
would
allow
for
a
least
a
couple
of
these
after
hiking
through
the
snowbound
woods
or
an
icy
suburban
street
whatever
gets
you
to
this
this
beer
is
simply
fantastic
a
malty
beer
with
good
hop
forward
flavor
this
beer
hits
what
i
love
malty
slighty
bready
with
a
blast
of
hops
as
a
finishing
flavor
you
dont
really
expect
odell
brewing
is
always
dead
on
i
love
all
of
thier
beer
and
this
one
is
no
different
dont
skip
this
one
overall
i
liked
it
on
the
higher
end
of
the
winter
warmers
i
have
tried
so
far
but
not
the
best
very
tasty
easy
drinking
yet
very
flavorful
one
of
those
that
you
just
need
to
try
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
odells
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
from
odell
it
pours
an
amberorange
with
a
nice
lacy
head
smell
is
of
malt
and
sweetness
as
is
the
taste
with
very
little
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
rich
without
being
overpowering
overall
one
of
odells
better
beers
but
it
cannot
compete
with
their
ipa
or
myrcenary
double
ipa
bravo
pours
a
pretty
dark
amber
with
significant
head
that
crumples
after
a
few
minutes
and
leaves
light
lacing
on
the
glass
really
good
looking
beer
for
sure
smells
caramelly
and
can
definitely
detect
the
hops
in
the
nose
malty
flavor
with
nice
hop
balance
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
a
nice
winter
warmer
from
odell
but
not
really
taking
it
to
a
new
level
and
at
6
abv
may
want
to
keep
your
hoodie
on
the
hops
and
sessionability
put
this
one
over
o
this
beer
grew
on
me
with
every
sip
its
somewhat
unassuming
which
increases
the
drinkability
while
still
having
complex
enough
flavours
to
keep
me
entertained
fair
representation
of
a
winter
warmer
but
nothing
special
o
a
very
good
winter
warmer
style
ale
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
deep
amber
color
with
a
foamed
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
lacing
and
retention
are
very
good
on
this
beer
the
smell
is
malty
fairly
sweet
and
warming
there
is
a
subtle
earthiness
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
with
a
warming
toasted
caramel
flavor
with
a
very
subtle
spice
note
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
nice
carbonation
and
body
too
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
brew
but
not
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
for
the
beer
is
copper
hued
with
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
teeming
with
effervescence
the
aroma
offers
malt
grain
a
hint
of
fruit
subtle
sweetness
and
spice
rather
mild
scent
overall
the
flavor
is
bready
and
sweet
odd
finish
a
bit
harsh
and
getting
worse
with
every
drink
ut
oh
not
really
what
comes
to
mind
when
i
think
of
a
winter
warmer
bland
unexciting
and
forgetful
cmon
man
overall
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
several
in
a
row
happily
seems
like
it
would
pair
well
with
a
meal
but
is
good
enough
to
stand
on
its
own
wish
this
was
available
locally
to
get
through
the
colder
months
overall
4
0
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
that
shows
no
booze
and
really
great
balance
for
the
style
i
dont
often
drink
winter
warmers
but
i
can
see
the
appeal
with
an
example
like
this
its
easydrinking
maltforward
without
being
too
thick
or
sweet
but
still
opens
up
nicely
as
it
warms
a
very
nice
beer
over
all
this
is
a
great
beer
to
me
i
will
be
buying
a
couple
of
six
packs
saturday
when
i
go
to
the
state
line
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
not
overall
a
very
solid
winter
warmer
doesnt
have
the
typical
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
type
spices
but
it
has
some
nice
subtle
undertones

final
thoughts
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmer
seasonal
offerings
odell
brewing
proves
time
and
time
again
that
they
know
how
to
make
a
great
beer
would
i
drink
it
again
yep
worth
at
least
one
sixer
every
december
taste
is
similar
heavily
malted
with
tones
of
toffee
and
caramel
and
a
light
hoppy
finish
this
one
drinks
like
a
heavier
amber
ale
and
holds
up
well
as
a
heavybodied
nighttime
session
brew
for
the
colder
months
o
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
was
pleased
to
find
a
simple
yet
perfectly
balanced
ale
offering
up
a
solid
caramel
malt
profile
with
a
lightly
hopped
finish
easily
sessionable
and
well
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
copperyamber
with
a
nice
foamy
khaki
head
good
lacing
and
lots
of
effervescence
definitely
malt
forward
sugared
candy
nutty
bread
and
a
little
spice
taste
is
better
than
i
expected
bready
nutty
a
little
candied
sugar
and
some
cinnamon
in
the
finish
along
with
just
a
touch
of
some
hops
leaves
a
dry
finish
a
nice
medium
body
some
activity
overall
odell
with
another
really
good
seasonal
should
i
have
expected
anything
else
from
them
with
the
shortening
of
the
days
and
the
weather
beginning
to
cool
this
beer
hits
the
spot
its
become
one
of
my
favorite
winter
nightcaps
o
a
malty
drinkable
warming
ale
of
moderately
high
strength
up
to
odells
very
high
quality
standards
i
would
expect
no
less
from
them
decent
and
easy
drinking
i
have
since
gone
to
the
odell
website
and
found
that
isolation
is
a
seasonal
any
resemblance
to
beers
mentioned
previously
are
heretofore
coincidence
that
said
good
beer
is
good
beer
and
isolation
independent
of
the
similarities
i
have
discussed
above
is
a
very
decent
drink
i
wish
the
folks
at
odell
much
success
and
hope
to
see
them
in
my
market
soon
thin
white
head
with
a
lace
over
a
copper
colored
ale
that
changes
from
gold
to
amber
in
the
bar
light
strong
malt
caramel
and
toffee
in
the
nosesubtle
spice
from
the
hop
and
a
hotness
from
the
alcohol
newcastle
like
malt
taste
but
much
hoppier
and
it
has
a
mineral
twang
over
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
fruity
and
floral
hop
punches
through
the
apparent
alcohol
6
accroding
to
ba
good
beer
well
brewedim
just
not
a
fan
of
it
notes
im
probably
the
most
critical
person
on
the
planet
when
it
comes
to
winter
warmers
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
i
can
fully
endorse
if
only
it
were
distributed
here
overall
not
terribly
intriguing
to
think
about
but
very
goodtasting
an
above
average
winter
warmer
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
spice
character
o
very
nice
beer
a
perfect
fit
for
a
cold

this
one
definitely
grew
on
me
as
i
got
more
accustomed
to
the
style
of
winter
warmers
its
balanced
in
such
a
way
that
it
seems
like
a
way
bigger
beer
than
it
actually
is
although
its
only
6
abv
isolation
has
an
excellent
warming
quality
to
it
tastes
like
an
old
ale
winter
warmers
are
usually
more
sessionable
for
me
and
this
just
seemed
like
a
bigger
beer
than
a
6
winter
warmer
should
be
i
guess
thats
why
i
age
half
of
em
seeing
if
they
grow
into
their
big
boy
pants
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
i
like
it
better
on
tap
of
course
but
even
in
the
bottle
it
is
pretty
good
o
another
solid
brew
from
odell
just
not
my
favorite
nice
beer
to
curl
up
with
by
a
fire
and
enjoy
a
few
without
putting
your
lights
out
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
nothing
crazy
spectacular
but
i
have
gotten
through
a
few
of
these
this
winter
o
not
what
i
want
in
a
winter
warmer
this
thing
has
light
belgian
notes
and
even
reminds
me
of
a
maibock
or
helles
bock
lagerish
in
a
way
just
not
dark
spicy
malty
or
hoppy
enough
for
me
smells
a
bit
hoppy
some
biscuit
and
getting
some
tang
somwhere
in
there
maybe
orange
pours
an
amber
color
with
no
head
and
very
little
lacing
taste
is
a
tad
bit
hoppy
biscuity
and
tangy
finishes
with
an
odd
tang
not
a
bad
brew
nice
beer
easy
drinking
id
get
it
again
o
seriously
disappointing
none
of
the
depth
or
spice
i
enjoy
in
my
winter
warmers
what
you
have
here
is
a
beer
that
doesnt
know
what
it
wants
to
be
hop
or
malt
forward
it
is
quite
an
exercise
in
mediocrity
hello
drain
i
had
to
edit
this
after
i
saw
the
bros
went
100
not
what
i
got
out
of
this
beer
overall
a
deliciously
warming
beer
perfect
for
christmas
pours
a
dark
clear
amber
with
a
beige
head
head
is
about
a
finger
high
and
leaves
some
faint
lacing
nose
is
full
of
biscuity
malt
with
a
faint
whiff
of
hops
taste
is
earthy
malts
up
front
with
some
diacetyl
in
the
finish
and
a
nice
faint
hop
crispness
throughout
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
sticky
finish
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
out
there
but
definitely
a
solid
brew
2012s
version
is
certainly
a
winner
good
allaround
winter
warmer
with
great
balance
and
complexity
its
not
so
cloy
as
some
of
this
style
are
but
its
there
but
balanced
so
well
by
the
hops
nice
caramel
malt
maybe
its
too
fresh
but
the
hops
kinda
take
precedent
this
beer
needs
some
time
i
might
save
a
bottle
for
a
month
in
the
bottom
of
the
fridge
and
review
as
i
can
hear
the
malts
screaming
but
the
hops
balance
a
bit
too
well
which
i
really
like
i
can
tell
this
beer
was
made
with
love
isolation
is
a
malty
warming
rich
delight
of
a
winter
warmer
would
be
great
on
a
snowy
night
when
the
frost
keeps
you
inside
isolated
odell
isolation
ale
this
ale
has
a
leatherbrown
color
very
clear
with
some
fine
carbonation
the
head
is
thin
and
offwhite
the
aroma
hits
you
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
similar
a
big
burst
of
malt
tails
off
to
some
warming
alcohol
this
is
a
robust
ale
with
lots
of
flavor
but
still
smooth
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
seem
to
even
rate
as
a
winter
warmer
its
a
decent
pale
ale
and
very
drinkable
but
not
special
enough
for
a
seasonal
i
wonder
if
the
recipe
has
changed
in
the
many
years
since
it
was
reviewed
by
the
alstrom
bros
very
good
beer
nice
to
sip
on
slowly
but
still
quite
drinkable
while
i
can
no
longer
say
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
odell
having
recently
had
the
infected
bourbon
barrel
stout
which
to
their
credit
they
are
dealing
with
amazingly
well
this
beer
continues
a
very
good
run
from
this
brewery
the
winter
warmer
tour
continues
this
was
very
attractive
in
the
glass
and
was
pretty
good
on
the
tongue
not
super
complex
but
a
nice
sweet
beer
with
a
little
pine
kick
at

it

nothing
to

grainy

ok
mouthfeel
somewhat
thin
for
my
liking
rather
ho
hum
lose
the
bitterness
and
more
of
a
soft
malty
flavor
and
i
think
i
would
enjoy
it
more
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
winter
warmer
and
an
all
around
tasty
brew
recommended
to
all
cheers
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
appreciate
that
odell
took
the
liberty
of
brewing
a
winter
seasonal
without
dumping
pounds
of
spices
in
the
boil
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
many
more
this
fall
and
winter
overall
not
impressed
apparently
this
is
suppose
to
be
a
spiced
type
ale
but
it
comes
off
like
midas
touch
from
dfh
which
if
you
like
would
make
this
beer
a
sure
tradepurchase
for
me
though
it
too
closely
resembles
malt
liquor
overall
a
decent
beer
nose
really
threw
me
off
kind
of
wondering
if
i
had
a
bad
bottle
would
drink
again
but
wont
seek
out
all
4s
not
your
traditional
winter
warmer
per
se
more
of
a
prewinter
drink
the
lighter
mouthfeel
gives
it
more
of
an
autumnal
vibe
rather
than
a
sit
in
your
gut
freezing
night
beverage
pours
a
maple
syrup
colored
indian
red
with
a
half
inch
head
that
hangs
out
the
whole
time
nose
is
balanced
caramel
malts
and
aromatic
hops
smells
english
in
that
old
and
dusty
kind
of
way
taste
is
balanced
with
a
heavy
malt
backbone
slightly
dry
at
6
1
i
would
not
choose
it
to
get
me
through
the
dead
of
february
but
its
perfect
for
november
a
bottle
from
last
years
batch
poured
into
my
odell
glass
the
color
is
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
minimal
lacing
that
fades
quickly
the
nose
is
of
biscuit
malts
light
caramel
and
maybe
a
hit
of
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
malts
sugars
and
some
light
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
there
really
isnt
much
hop
to
be
found
except
right
at
the
last
breath
the
drink
the
finish
is
a
soft
dryness
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
there
isnt
any
spice
to
be
found
which
is
nice
for
a
change
a
good
almost
sessionable
winter
warmer
for
me
odell
is
top
5
in
my
book
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
well
flavored
and
not
overpowering
seasonal
beer
one
of
my
christmas
favorites
every
year
poured
a
rich
dense
reddishbrown
color
with
a
generous
tan
head
aromas
of
fruitcake
malt
and
earthy
hops
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
dark
fruits
fruitcake
earthy
hops
sugar
and
malt
pretty
good
although
from
experience
i
was
expecting
a
winter
warmer
to
be
slightly
spiced
a
nice
balance
of
flavours
with
pleasant
sweetness
could
perhaps
have
done
with
some
subtle
roasty
notes
to
add
character
the
body
seemed
a
little
thin
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
nonetheless
worth
sampling
cheers
big
thanks
goes
out
to
jmkratt
for
sending
me
a
bottle
of
this
as
an
extra
in
a
past
trade
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
redorange
with
a
two
finger
bone
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutmeg
coriander
and
clove
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
coriander
nutmeg
and
enise
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
but
was
far
from
aweinspiring
it
was
actually
decent
for
a
winter
warmer
but
just
not
very
memorable
the
flavor
was
pretty
heavy
on
the
spices
as
one
would
expect
but
it
just
didnt
have
any
sweetness
to
really
balance
it
out
to
the
degree
of
the
spices
pretty
much
the
same
story
for
the
aroma
as
well
worth
trying
but
thats
about
it
i
dont
really
give
a
schlitz
about
isolation
ale
its
not
bad
but
there
is
better
to
be
had
drinkability
quite
delicious
i
often
have
two
would
recommend
to
others
this
beer
makes
me
wish
i
lived
closer
to
colorado
very
enjoyable
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
wanted
it
to
be
a
bit
bolder
in
just
about
every
way
imaginable
a
six
percent
winter
warmer
is
definitely
on
the
low
alcohol
side
so
it
drank
easily
but
just
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
i
suppose
d
it
comes
close
to
knocking
it
out
of
the
park
for
this
style
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
where
i
get
snowed
in
unfortunately
that
doesnt
happen
that
often
here
in
san
diego
the
body
is
moderate
mild
crispness
easy
finish
this
isnt
your
typical
winter
warmer
though
what
is
i
guess
this
is
a
pretty
allencompassing
style
this
one
is
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
vanilla
applesauce
mild
spices
and
a
bready
finish
this
isnt
what
i
expected
but
its
good
nonetheless
glad
i
have
a
couple
bottles
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
light
fluffy
two
finger
tan
head
and
alot
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
way
out
aromas
of
carmel
malts
and
spice
sweet
malt
and
carmel
on
the

with
enough

goodness
to
make
things
interesing
a
dry
medium
bodied
brew
with
good
carbonation
exceptionally
drinkable
d
average
at
best
not
much
else
to
say
overall
drinkability
is
good
i
understand
this
is
the
winter
seasonal
but
this
sure
drinks
like
a
better
version
of
a
fat
tire
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
body
and
fine
limited
carbonation
results
in
a
pretty

feel
this
is
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
overall
nicely
done
by
odell
id
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
pretty
drinkable
nice
winter
time
brew
unfortunately
this
is
only
an
average
beer
for
its
style
but
with

excellent

o
ive
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
a
couple
months
much
better
than
i
expected
very
drinkable
beer
i
was
actually
surprised
by
this
beer
was
never
really
a
sw
fan
but
the
second
i
poured
this
winter
warmer
i
could
smell
the
figs
and
coco
the
taste
is
exactly
how
it
smells
rich
and
creamy
definitely
hides
the
abv
well
small
hints
of
spices
thrown
in
but
not
over
powering
will
add
this
to
my
list
of
chilly
weather
beers
to
pick
up
poured
from
a
red
waxed

into

the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
ruby
highlighted
brown
coloring
with
a
tall
creamy
frothy
light
tan
head
that
settles
into
a

this
is
a

this
is
a
solid
holiday
brew
its
nothing
magical
but
its
simply
a
well
crafted
brew
that
will
hit
the
spot
during

its
along
the
lines

for

mark
for
me
the
aroma
is
really
lacking
and
i
wish
the
flavor
had
a

depth
still
it
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would

again
during

who

kind
good

of

character
with
enough

presence
to
prevent
it
from
becoming
completely

a

my
tastes
perfumey
notes
and
a
touch
of
acetaldehyde
surface
as
it
warms

enjoyable
with
well

alcohol
making
this
beer
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
nice
combination
of
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
spices

just
doesnt

work
for
me
overall
a
fine
brew
from
a
great
brewery
caution
this
beer
will
sneak
up
on
you
something
fierce
o
a
nofrills
easygoing
winter
warmer
thats
dangerously
drinkable
sweet
water
brewing
company
overall
not
terribly
exciting
but
a
nice
well
balanced
very
drinkable
flavour
you
would
never
know
it
had
a
higher
abv
ive
only
had
a
few
beers
from
this
brewer
but
they
have
all
been
winners
so
far
this
beer
pours
up
a
deep
brown
almost
black
there
is
a
one
finger
light
brown
head
no
retention
to
speak
of
and
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
at
first
but
it
fades
away
quickly
the
nose
is
spicy
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
taste
is
rather
sweet
at
first
sip
with
some
notes
of
cola
and
molasses
the
finish
has
a
mild
bitterness
with
some
spiciness
but
the
sweetness
upfront
overshadows
it
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
pleasing
with
a
syrupy
texture
not
mad
overall
o
a
fairly
simple
and
spicy
winter
warmer
fairly
mellow
with
decent
balance
easy
drinking
but
somewhat
plain
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
one
finger
of
light
brown
colored
head
settles
to
a
thin
layer
with
a
few
splotches
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
brown
sugar
lots
of
baking
spices
a
little
plum
and
toasted
bread
taste
dark
brown
sugar
gingerbread
end
of
the
sip
is
soft
pear
grape
skin
and
more
cinnamon
sweet
creamy
feel
enough
spices
and
mild
spicy
and
earthy
hopping
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
easy
drinking
for
8
5
o
if
not
for
the
average
appearance
this
would
actually
be
a
pretty
good
beer
all
things
considered
its
a
refreshing
take
on
a
classic
style
o
tasty
alcoholic
and
roasty
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
o
nice
complexity
not
bad
for
a
winter
warmer
would
get
again
o
pretty
good
showing
this
year
and
a
certain
upgrade
from
past
editions
holiday
spices
are
abundant
atop
a
might
blend
of
malts
not
nearly
as
boozy
as
i
tend
to
feel
about
warmers
i
would
get
this
again
o
a
nice
winter
brew
i
enjoy
the
elements
of
a
stout
that
were
incorporated
into
its
characteristics
wnich
is
unique
the
flavors
were
maybe
a
bit
too
subtle
but
were
present
enough
to
mask
most
of
the
alcohol
recommended
age
1
years
o
this
is
a
great
beer
seems
like
theyre
trying
too
hard
to
add
holiday
cheer
to
this
one
overdone
for
the
style
even
tho
there
is
debate
on
what
this
style
should
be
imo
it
should
be
something
you
could
enjoy
several
of
at
a
gathering
but
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
choker
sweetwater
festive
ale
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
tiny
mocha
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
its
chocolatey
and
full
of
holiday
spices
and
a
decent
amount
of
hops
ginger
comes
through
strong
on
the
taste
pairing
well
with
the
aroma
and
solid
hop
kick
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
and
with
a
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
leading
to
a
smooth
finish
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
ive
had
very
tasty
poured
from
waxed
bomber
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
very
deep
brown
along
with
a
nice
medium
to
thin
tan
head
aromas
of
cinnamon
caramel
nutmeg
toasted
malts
and
maybe
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
flavor
allows
for
a
decent
amount
of
chocolate
to
sneak
in
there
to
go
with
the
cinnamon
holiday
spice
vegetation
notes
and
sweet
malt
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
throughout
overall
a
nice
holiday
beer
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
seeking
out
again
sweetwater
festive
ale
pours
a
solid
black
with
between
two
and
three
fingers
of
khaki
colored
foa
crowning
the
beer
head
retention
is
well
above
average
and
theres
definitely
more
of
the
glass
left
covered
in
lacing
than
not
the
nose
is
disappointingly
weak
there
are
some
light
chocolaty
notes
and
a
decent
amount
of
cinnamon
aroma
but
all
in
all
its
a
bit
muted
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
more
complex
if
still
dull
the
malt
opening
features
layers
of
biscuit
and
caramel
along
with
a
delicate
chocolate
presence
the
back
end
is
cinnamon
which
brings
an
almost
pepper
like
spiciness
to
bear
the
mace
is
more
noticeable
here
adding
a
bit
of
balance
to
things
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
on
the
flat
side
all
in
all
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lackluster
ive
found
most
of
sweetwaters
beers
to
be
hitormiss
and
this
one
is
unfortunately
trending
towards
the
latter
i
like
the
concept
for
the
beer
but
the
execution
largely
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
wow
this
beer
really
is
a
mouthful
pours
a
big
head
but
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
and
taste
of
coffee
mixed
with
winter
spices
is
upfront
the
alcohol
is
warming
but
really
packs
a
punch
at
the
end
overall
a
wonderful
warming
winter
beer
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
over
the
holidays
o
such
a
strange
beer
very
easy
to
drink
better
than
many
winter
warmers
ive
had
yet
not
blowaway
at
all
its
s
45
but
it
is
still
very
recommended
overall
the
marks
on
this
beer
are
high
the
taste
and
smell
are
nothing
short
of
heavenly
i
would
have
preferred
a
heavier
feel
but
nothing
to
complain
about
with
this
one
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
winter
warmer
really
sticky
candyish
and
malty
all
the
flavors
that
should
be
in
a
warmer
ill
have
to
get
some
more
for
the
holiday
season
this
year
o
a
really
nice
christmas
beer
with
a
much
fuller
body
than
its
better
known
competition
i
e
schlafly
christmas
great
lakes
christmas
etc
festive
ale
is
unique
in
that
it
has
a
much
more
solid
malt
presence
with
some
excellent
toasted
biscuit
and
subtle
chocolate
notes
that
in
some
ways
call
to
mind
a
porter
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
a
sixpack
of
this
over
the
holidays
excellent
work
sweetwater
d
overall
a
solid
little
winter
warmer
not
the
best
but
worth
trying
o
im
happy
to
have
tried
this
again
thanks
to
mark
ive
never
reviewed
it
but
have
been
the
recipient
of
a
couple
festive
ales
over
the
years
its
a
better
than
average
winter
warmer
that
does
a
good
job
with
flavors
that
match
my
palate
and
with
subtle
warming
yum
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
that
works
well
overall
this
works
very
well
as
a
winter
warmer
and
does
not
offend
in
any
way
just
a
solid
offering
altogether
the
flavor
becomes
a
little
boring
throughout
the
drink
the
chocolate
caramel
and
ginger
start
out
as
a
good
flavor
as
i
continued
to
drink
it
though
they
lost
their
individual
flavor
they
meshed
together
into
an
incoherent
onedimensional
boring
flavor
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
enjoyable
at
first
but
i
dont
think
its
something
i
would
come
back
to
big
thanks
to
chefmikeanderson
for
sending
this
as
an
extra
pours
out
a
dark
cola
color
a
tan
head
rises
to
a
fingers
height
than
quickly
falls
to
a
thin
almost
nonexistant
ring
smells
very
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
cinammon
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
slight
smokey
finish
mouthfeels
thin
for
the
style
but
has
decent
carbonation
a
little
spicy
and
warm
on
the
finish
from
the
cinammon
overall
this
is
easy
drinkin
goes
down
smooth
o
a
good
seasonal
from
sweetwater
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watered
down
but
other
than
that
a
winter
warmer
to
visit
if
you
have
a
chance
appears
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
malty
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
tastes
of
dark
roasty
malts
cinnamon
and
a
light
alcohol
finish
not
a
very
robust
mouthfeel
somewhat
light
but
made
it
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
but
not
the
best
in
its
field
amazing
beer
i
love
christmas
time
when
all
the
great
seasonal
brews
come
around
anyway
this
beer
is
very
inviting
when
poured
into
a
glass
it
looks
almost
exactly
like
a
coke
the
smell
was
a
bit
fainter
than
i
expected
but
this
beer
has
awesome
taste
it
all
the
malts
are
so
balanced
it
has
nice
light
fluffy
mouthfeel
very
warming
for
real
this
is
a
excellent
winter
ale
if
you
can
get
on
please
do
the
real
catch
is
the
beer
is
so
smooth
you
dont
realize
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
and
be
surprised
by
the
warmth
overall
its
an
easy
to
drink
beer
and
a
nice
representation
of
a
winter
warmer
i
would
definitely
drink
again
color
is
a
very
deep
brown
to
nearly
black
with
a
modest
tan
head
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
scent
and
taste
are
both
very
much
like
a
porter
sweet
malts
dominate
chocolatey
nutty
molassesy
hardly
a
trace
of
bitterness
to
be
found
very
drinkable
and
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
hardly
noticed
the
8
6
abv
at
all
sweetwater
could
pass
this
off
as
a
nice
yearround
porter
festive
ale
is
a
pretty
good
warmer
and
i
could
see
it
getting
better
with
some
age
on
it
i
guess
the
wax
should
have
tipped
me
off
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
as
far
as
winter
warmers
go
i
havent
had
many
but
i
personally
enjoyed
this
more
than
jubelale
which
i
also
had
recently
mainly
because
i
like
my
hops
more
subdued
and
this
definitely
fits
the
bill
for
that
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
had
in
my
life
a
completely
balanced
highly
drinkable
ale
id
love
to
try
an
oaked
version
of
this
if
they
had
one
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
most
of
the
time
when
american
brewers
try
to
modernize
read
load
up
on
the
american
hops
a
classic
malt
leaning
english
style
its
a
hot
mess
this
is
a
worthy
exception
west
coast
flavored
hops
add
healthy
balance
but
because
the
malt
profile
is
likewise
juiced
it
is
able
to
handle
the
hops
without
collapsing
on
itself
the
overall
effect
is
still
a
little
clunky
but
drinks
much
easier
and
finishes
cleaner
than
should
be
physically
possible
hints
of
warming
alcohol
are
everywhere
but
considering
the
8
6
thats
hardly
a
surprise
i
defy
you
to
find
a
more
drinkable
winter
warmer
with
a
similar
punch
good
effort
sweetwater
overall
4
0
a
very
tasty
holiday
brew
not
too
thick
to
consider
as
a
session
lager
its
huge
8
abv
is
completely
unnoticeable
these
are
the
type
of
beers
that
tend
to
sneak
up
on
you
when
you
are
out
so
enjoy
responsibly
folks
if
you
can
find
this
beer
buy
it
not
my
favorite
but
a
good
bet
if
nothing
else
is
there
for
holiday
beer
o
a
nice
winter
brew
excellent
on
a
cold
evening
overall
a
winter
ale
with
a
nice
dose
of
spices
and
a
superb
maltiness
a
very
drinkable
brew
even
with
the
noticeably
strong
alcohol
presence
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
a
great
dark
roasty
spicy
beer
with
plenty
to
offer
oi
was
really
surprised
by
this
when
at
an
airport
i
usually
dont
expect
much
but
i
am
here
with
a
great
beer
of
a
style
i
usually
dont
prefer
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
ive
ever
had
its
definitely
and
after
dinner
beer
though
o
a
bit
boring
but
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
like
i
said
above
there
is
no
hint
of
the
abv
at
all
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
for
my
liking
the
aroma
and
taste
are
very
similar
i
havent
had
previous
years
but
i
liked
this
one
o
festival
ale
is
solid
all
aspects
are
enjoyable
and
its
incredibly
drinkable
given
the
abv
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
ill
pick
this
up
again
o
imo
its
hard
to
find
a
true
winter
warmer
many
that
receive
that
label
dont
include
the
characteristics
that
i
typically
want
this
beer
has
them
all
perfect
cold
weather
christmas
beer
o
very
nice
warmer
reminds
me
of
a
stronger
version
of
a
nut
brown
ale
o
its
that
time
of
year
again
and
its
not
a
bad
way
to
start
the
winter
beer
season
with
this
beer
easy
drinking
for
the
alcohol
content
o
not
as
good
as
expected
the
fruity
flavors
are
nice
but
thin
and
boozy
o
not
my
thing
if
youre
really
into
winter
warmers
look
elsewhere
beer
is
thick
sweet
like
syrup
and
hard
to
swallow
almost
no
other
flavors
other
than
syrup
i
didnt
really
like
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
a
heavier
body
and
light
carbonation
it
really
lets
the
malts
shine
and
take
the
warm
snuggly
spotlight
wow
what
a
great
sesonal
and
cheap
this
one
was
4
99
how
can
the
brewery
use
all
that
grain
and
only
charge
that
for
a
bottle
a
great
find
i
cant
wait
for
next
years
festive
ale
is
an
easydrinking
8
5
abv
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
i
dont
think
the
taste
has
held
up
too
great
over
the
last
five
years
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
really
reminded
me
of
a
barleywine
which
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
seemed
a
tiny
bit
metallic
and
a
bit
faded
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
of
it
and
would
give
another
shot
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
well
balanced
complex
and
pretty
quaffable
the
abv
is
excellently
masked
and
i
can
see
this
one
getting
better
with
age
beer
should
be
consumed
now
and
likely
not
aged
further
in
my
opinion
d
very
drinkable
and
the
abv
is
hidden
convincingly
still
something
about
it
is
not
quite
to
my
taste
though
all
my
friends
love
it
i
cant
recommend
it
but
i
wouldnt
steer
you
away
very
nice
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
and
one
ill
definitely
try
and
track
down
next
year
again
d
very
drinkable
despite
abv
d
enjoying
this
one
all
the
way
through
goes
down
so
easily
on
this
cold
snowy
winter
night
d
nice
complexity
but
the
mouthfeel
is
off
d
pretty
good
but
doesnt
excite
me
all
that
much
will
i
ever
buy
it
nope
d
tasty
brew
but
drinkability
is
limited
with
the
residual
sweetness
and
there
might
be
a
bit
of
a
flaw
in
there
with
the
diacetyl
damn
tasty
this
winter
warmer
is
serious
with
a
festive
back
end
until
the
abv
catches
you
this
is
highly
drinkable
the
flavor
is
spicy
with
a
nice
malty
sweetness
balancing
the
spice
at
the
end
the
spice
is
cinnamon
nutmeg
coriander
i
believe
too
the
malt
is
complex
and
reminds
me
of
a
heavy
brown
ale
drinkability
is
where
this
excels
compared
to
its
bottled
brethren
the
mouthfeel
too
is
smooth
and
creamy
d
very
flavorful
and
complex
i
would
give
it
a
higher
rating
if
it
were
not
for
how
thin
it
is
easy
to
drink
d
this
was
a
nice
porterish
winter
warmer
but
there
was
nothing
exceptional
about
the
brew
good
scent
and
taste
with
a
mediocre
body
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
but
not
super
memorable
di
enjoyed
this
immensely
if
i
had
the
money
and
the
dd
i
could
see
myself
drink
a
number
of
these
in
a
row
drinkability
was
quite
good
with
this
one
i
had
two
d
not
bad
for
the
drinkability
abv
and
body
and
texture
all
were
not
bad
for
the
genre
no
complaints
here
from
me
or
my
fellow
tasting
companions
d
texture
and
flavor
make
for
an
easy
drinker
d
this
is
not
the
typical
winter
warmer
as
it
tastes
and
drinks
more
like
a
strong
porterdubble
mix
drinkability
i
like
the
flavors
and
feel
i
picked
a
great
night
that
is
absolutely
frigid
outside
to
enjoy
this
as
the
warming
sensation
in
the
belly
is
quite
pleasant
as
well
the
abv
is
a
tad
high
but
i
feel
that
if
its
just
sipped
over
the
course
of
the
night
i
could
get
through
a
couple
bye
try
it
but
dont
buy
it
there
are
better
winter
ales
out
there
such
as
jubilations
avery
overall
impression
sweetwater
is
perhaps
my
favorite
regional
brewery
but
this
is
an
awkwardtasting
brew
that
misses
the
mark
cant
recommend
this
one
12oz
bottle
thanks
to
bulbman
appreciate
it
dark
brown
color
short
wispy
head
smells
a
little
spicy
like
a
winter
warmer
but
also
very
malty
the
taste
is
mostly
malts
to
me
but
maybe
there
is
a
hint
of
cinnamon
hiding
this
was
not
bad
at
all
and
id
probably
buy
a
sixer
if
i
could
the
alcohol
was
not
noticed
at
all
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
from
sweetwater
if
i
come
across
this
in
my
travels
again
i
wont
hesitate
to
have
it
again
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
d
amazing
flavor
a
beer
i
will
always
love
to
have
especially
in
the
colder
months
of
the
year
d
i
like
this
beer
a
six
pack
would
be
in
my
fridge
for
sure
if
i
could
buy
sweetwater
in
ohio
a
few
of
these
and
id
be
set
for
a
cold
night
and
sleep
great
all
night
long
all
in
all
very
good
beer
id
never
had
this
before
but
will
definitely
buy
one
when
i
see
it
after
mine
is
gone
the
drinkability
would
be
better
if
it
werent
so
high

of

summary
i
have
done
many
verticles
over
the
last
15
plus
years
and
had
always
seemed
to
be
a
dog
in
the
bunch
usually
one
year
didnt
hold
us
as
well
or
really
went
south
the
sweeatwater
held
up
very
well
and
was
consistant
with
its
quality
and
taste
there
were
no
dogs
in
this
pack
of
great
vintage
festive
ales
the
drinkability
is
soso
with
lots
of
thick
syrupy
flavors
sticking
all
over
the
mouth
and
some
tingly
and
warming
booze
but
not
too
much
i
would
like
to
try
next
years
festive
fresh
maybe
the
6
months
did
not
do
this
one
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
below
average
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
liked
more
then
i
expected
i
would
i
usually
see
winter
beers
and
think
they
will
be
all
spice
but
this
one
was
a
nice
change
it
had
some
nice
chocolaty
flavors
to
it
that
i
enjoyed
sweetwater
did
a
pretty
good
job
with
this
one
has
elements
of
both
a
winter
warmer
and
a
stout
rich
somewhat
sweet
and
roasty
malts
lead
the
way
with
some
dark
fruits
and
bready
yeast
along
for
the
ride
i
would
be
surprised
if
some
spices
were
not
used
in
this
beer
i
get
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
in
here
maybe
even
a
cloveish
flavor
that
is
not
quite
like
a
hefeweizen
clove
flavor
while
the
abv
is
hidden
well
there
still
is
a
detectable
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
which
helps
add
to
the
complexity
of
the
beer
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
quite
a
bit
would
love
to
be
able
to
get
my
paws
on
this
every
year
during
the
holiday
season
such
a
surprise
to
see
that
its
an
07
festive
ale
i
was
thinking
it
was
a
belgian
the
whole
time
overall
this
2008
version
is
okay
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
expected
a
complex
tasting
christmas
ale
and
got
what
appears
to
taste
a
lot
like
a
double
bock
i
have
the
second
bottle
but
am
not
as
exicted
about
this
ale
as
i
was
before
having
it
d
nicely
balanced
goes
down
easily
in
my
winter
warmer
days
i
could
drink
these
all
day
one
would
probably
do
me
now
drinkability
i
like
the
flavors
and
feel
i
picked
a
great
night
that
is
absolutely
frigid
outside
to
enjoy
this
as
the
warming
sensation
in
the
belly
is
quite
pleasant
as
well
the
abv
is
a
tad
high
but
i
feel
that
if
its
just
sipped
over
the
course
of
the
night
i
could
get
through
a
couple
very
full
rich
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
in
the
mouth
very
enjoyable
out
of
the
6
or
7
xmas
ales
ive
had
each
of
the
last
couple
years
this
has
been
probably
my
favorite
really
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
as
good
as
this
one
is
one
12oz
bottle
is
plenty
for
the
style
though
thats
fine
ive
bought
the
flip
top
liters
before
and
that
is
just
way
too
much
of
a
beer
this
heavy
for
us
33
8oz

in
my

poured
the
color
of
cola
with
some
highlights
around
the
base
half
inch
offwhite
head
quickly
dissipates
into
nothing
nose
is
a
little
sour
malty
and
some
booze
taste
is
malty
roasty
watery
and
sour
dark
fruit
plums
prunes
raisins
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
even
background
effervescence
something
was
a
little
off
on
this
one
definitely
some
oxidation
here
id
have
to
say
that
this
beer
was
a
little
beyond
its
prime
drinkability
a
nice
dark
holiday
seasonal
that
leans
more
on
dark
fruit
than
spice
this
is
a
sipper
and
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
belgian
dark
ale
and
a
dark
red
wine
i
will
want
another
dnot
a
huge
fan
of
winter
ales
and
the
spices
associated
impartial
rating
as
the
flavors
are
decent
and
well
related
to
the
style
they
arent
huge
and
ive
had
better
winters
found
this
one
on
tap
at
the
sweetwater
brewing
grill
at
the
atlanta
airport
if
it
was
not
for
a
small
poster
i
wouldnt
have
even
known
this
was
available
great
style
to
end
the
holidays
with
poured
into
a
nice
goblet
this
winter
warmer
has
no
faults
nice
spices
easy
to
consume
and
just
the
right
baance
of
malts
makes
this
probably
the
best
airport
beers
i
can
remember
notes
what
a
treat
to
try
this
limited
bottled
beer
from
sweetwater
thanks
again

though
not

favorite
of
the
style
still
a
solid
entry
drinkability
overall
i
was
pleasantly
impressed
by
this
seasonal
offering
from
sweetwater
brewing
it
is
a
solid
offering
from
a
company
which
is
a
steady
performer
in
the
craft
brewing
segment
the
rich
taste
is
a
departure
from
other
sweetwater
beers
that
i
have
tasted
i
would
recommend
this
ale
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
dark
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
warms
you
up
but
not
to
the
greatest
extent
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
on
this
one
md
full
bodied
smooth
carbonation
is
low
drinkability
is
very
good
a
tasty
beer
indeed
ontap
at
flying

raleigh
on
dec
3
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
and
reviewed
from
notes
the
beer
was
served
a
dark
brown
that
showed
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
sported
a
barely
there
disappearing
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
slight
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
not
much
there
the
beer
is
somewhat
heavy
a
bit
overly
sweet
this
one
is
tolerable
but
a
huge
disappointment
thanks
casey
body
is
creamy
at
the
onset
but
finishes
with
a
nice
carbonation
pop
flavors
of
mild
cinnamon
some
molasses
licorice
and
mild
hops
this
is
a
good
winter
brew
here
not
your
typical
spicy
allcinnamon
xmas
beer
i
like
it
recommend
this
is
a
nice
smooth
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
never
get
tired
of
will
buy
again
next
year
the
high
alcohol
is
not
even
present
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
i
wish
it
was
in
fl
notes
appearance
and
smell
are
the
strong
suits
with
this
one
the
taste
is
good
but
the
thing
that
stuck
out
to
me
the
most
was
how
the
flavor
seemed
to
fade
rather
quickly
i
would
hope
that
the
flavors
themselves
would
be
the
most
endearing
quality
a
nice
solid
winter
beer
but
nothing
extraordinary
an
excellent
maltaccentuated
winter
brew
that
fails
a
bit
in
drinkability
due
to
the
somewhat
cloying
finish
but
that
shouldnt
keep
anyone
from
heading
out
and
picking
up
a
few
this
is
certainly
a
decent
pick
in
the
pack
of
winter
ales
and
for
a
georgia
boy
its
always
nice
to
see
such
a
beauty
born
so
near
to
home
drinkability
this
is
one
to
sip
and
sit
back
and
relax
with
a
good
brew
for
the
season

12oz

extra
from
gatorbeernerd
thanks
donnie
this
beer
is
dark
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
strong
kind
of
similar
to
an
american
barleywine
some
dark
fruits
like
plums
or
dates
no
real
spices
that
i
can
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
strong
malt
and
ethanol
with
maybe
a
little
cocoa
a
big
heavy
asskicker
of
a
beer
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
drink
on
cold
winter
nights
much
appreciated
and
i
also
have
a
2007
to
drink
later
overall
a
solid
offering
from
sweetwater
not
my
favorite
beer
ive
had
from
them
the
ipa
takes
the
cake
but
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
thanks
again
chip
for
the
chance
to
try
this
cheers
d
poured
into
a
pint
glass
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
a
dark
brown
color
that
is
almost
completely
opaque
aroma
is
not
too
strong
but
hints
of
spice
and
caramel
malts
initial
taste
is
of
hops
and
spice
finishing
with
notes
of
vanilla
this
beer
is
relatively
drinkable
for
being
on
the
darker
side
it
is
a
great
seasonal
offering
from
sweetwater
overall
the
hops
were
a
bit
more
prevalent
in
this
version
than
the
nondryhopped
version
a
big
surprise
right
however
the
other
flavors
didnt
seem
as
intense
still
a
solid
late
fall
beer
thats
worth
a
shot

best
i
have
had
from
yet
so
far
2006
vintage
from
one
liter
bottle
poured
into
tulip
light
brown
head
atop
a
raisin
colored
body
i
say
raisin
colored
because
that
is
the
first
smell
i
note
probably
due
to
the
3
year
age
other
aromas
seem
to
include
dates
brown
sugar
and
plum
picking
up
some
coffee
notes
in
the
taste
no
hops
no
alcohol
im
sure
due
to
mellowingimpressive
considering
the
abv
low
carbonation
at
this
point
and
very
easy
to
drink
extremely
easy
makes
me
proud
of
myself
for
having
resisted
this
one
for
so
long
d
nice
light
spice
flavor
with
a
great
malt
character
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
but
it
would
probably
get
old
pretty
quickly
if
the
bottle
wasnt
being
split
between
several
people
thick
full
bodied
feel
the
flavor
is
in
the
nose
but
is
a
bit
more
subtle
lots
of
spice
with
some
very
small
hints
of
some
faded
grassy
hops
in
the
background
some
sweet
malts
really
good
beer
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
great
its
a
solid
brew
but
nothing
extravegant
like
the
fancy
wax
dipped
swingtop
might
have
suggested
m
d
very
light
caebonation
lacking
really
sweet
and
inoffensive
drinking
not
too
bad
thanks
john
for
the
try
honestly
thanks
ive
thought
about
trying
to
trade
for
the
big
bottles
of
these
before
and
am
very
happy
that
ive
been
dissuaded
ill
try
to
do
you
right
soon
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tan
head
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
toffeecaramel
slightly
spicy
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
a
nice
touch
of
toffeecaramel
with
some
spicyness
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
brew
on
tap
at
barleys
asheville
nc
from
notes
found
of
a
november
2008
trip
highland
cold
mountain
was
released
a
couple
of
weeks
after
we
were
there
so
this
took
its
place
for
me
as
the
holiday
beer
of
choice
strong
aromas
of
cinnamon
sweet
and
herbal
notes
on
the
bottle
state
that
it
has
mace
in
it
not
sure
much
about
mace
other
than
i
think
its
in
pumpkin
pie
ill
take
their
word
for
it
great
holiday
beer
with
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
spices
not
overdone
at
all
i
think
the
extra
roasted
malt
notes
helped
in
this
category
beer
has
medium
to
light
body
carbonation
level
was
decent
it
was
smooth
and
drinkability
is
average
i
could
have
another
or
not
leaves
malty
bitter
aftertaste
i
think
the
next
time
that
i
visited
the
establishment
i
went
with
something
else
drinkability
is
nice
for
a
stronger
beer
there
is
not
a
lot
of
strong
tastes
going
on
so
it
makes
it
more
of
a
session
beer
than
a
great
flavorful
winter
warmer
this
is
a
decent
but
not
great
beer
from
sweetwater
probably
a
bit
onedimensional
for
me
but
i
may
sit
on
a
bottle
or
two
and
see
how
it
develops
over
time
this
beer
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
its
very
well
balanced
it
has
a
soft
feel
on
your
tongue
the
main
flavor
is
strong
caramelized
malts
with
a
light
spice
at
the
end
nothing
major
in
the
hop
department
a
tasty
all
around
good
beer
d
tasty
a
little
high
on
the
nutmeg
but
a
nice
abv
for
a
beer
of
its
type
strong
and
deceptively
drinkable
example
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
shows
that
this
beer
is
not
too
carbonated
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
this
overall
i
would
not
have
this
one
again
its
a
little
too
much
malt
and
hop
and
not
enough
delicate
balance
damn
im
glad
that
i
stumbled
on
this
one
tonight
d
good
beer
but
the
bomber
was
a
beast
to
finish
after
my
fiancee
didnt
like
it
drinks
pretty
easy
considering
the
higher
abv
this
could
go
great
with
a
hearty
meal
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
though
just
not
my
style
d
if
the
intent
is
to
drink
this
in
happy
company
around
a
warm
fire
complementing
some
mildly
sweet
desserts
like
a
pumpkin
pie
then
this
hits
the
spot
perfectly
by
far
the
best
brew
from
sweetwater
ive
ever
had
drinkability
this
is
one
fruity
bitch
of
a
beer
its
thick
malty
not
too
spicy
but
intensely
fruity
particularly
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
really
not
too
terribly
high
this
ones
drinking
really
well
right
about
now
so
give
it
a
shot
before
it
goes
south
pours
extremely
dark
close
to
a
stout
it
appears
the
mix
of
cloves
hops
and
malts
make
for
nice
mixed
aroma
the
taste
this
year
is
far
better
than
last
year
2007
having
had
this
many
times
over
the
years
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
and
impressed
by
this
years
version
while
distinct
in
flavor
form
the
previously
mentioned
mix
it
is
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
considering
i
have
cellared
many
of
the
previous
years
version
i
especially
look
forward
to
seeing
how
this
ages
d
very
high
you
would
never
in
life
guess
8
6
dgood
dinner
beer
and
definitely
a
beer
that
will
be
most
enjoyed
during
the
winter
months
also
has
active
yeast
so
buy
a
couple
of
extra
and
save
them
for
next
winter
the
drink
has
a

feel
superb
drinkability
its
a
nice
beverage
although
its
not
like
any
winter
warmer
ive
ever
had
very
interesting
and
worth
trying
again
pours
a
deep
brown
and
red
clear
but
almost
opaque
without
backlighting
tan
head
dies
down
rather
quickly
aroma
is
light
and
nutty
with
an
alcohol
punch
taste
is
smoky
and
nutty
but
rather
more
mild
and
less
viscous
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
from
the
appearance
low
carbonation
sweet
caramelized
maltiness
and
some
buttery
mouthfeel
and
quite
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
a
pleasant
unoffensive
brew
that
dark
beer
lovers
should
enjoy
if
theyre
not
looking
for
a
thickstout
kind
of
darkness
could
definitely
be
enjoyed
yearround
its

im
lovin

would
love
to
have
a

my

really
good
winter

worth
getting
a
bottle
every
year
drinkability
although
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
winter
warmers
with
exception
of
jubelale
this
one
was
pretty
damn
tasty
its
a
bit
different
but
in
a
fantastic
way
very
unique
and
honestly
the
more
it
warms
and
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
sweetwater
is
a
really
solid
brewery
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more

before
dark

with
a

low

complex

very
respectable
winter
warmer
i
could
drink
this
one
alot
if
it
was
around
here
and
colder
outside
for
more
than
a
month
a
year
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
it
and
hope
to
try
it
again
next
year
too
i
was
expecting
a
spiced
winter
warmer
but
luckily
came
across
something
much
more
to
my
liking
this
is
the
kind
of
winter
seasonal
i
like
seeing
released
keep
the
heavy
spicing
out
of
my
beer
and
in
the
fruitcake
the
taste
was
good
and
smooth
for
a
high
abv
beer
nice
balance
between
the
spices
and
the
sweet
malt
very
little
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
very
drinkable
but
i
think
one
is
enough
12
ounce
bottle
from
bruisin
ales
d
overall
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
and
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
evening
my
buddy
picked
me
up
a
sixer
or
2007
for
me
it
pours
a
real
dark
brown
with
amber
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
and
a
nice
tan
head
theres
really
nothing
distinct
about
the
smell
for
me
but
its
not
bad
the
taste
was
surprisingly
good
and
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
and
malts
very
well
balanced
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
realizing
that
im
in
over
my
head
this
was
my
first
beer
of
this
style
ill
have
to
look
for
something
similar
pours

very

very

thanks
a
lot
for
sharing
russ
finally
got
around
to
reviwing
this
one
never
got
a
chance
last
year
this
is
the
2007
pours
very
dark
brown
with
some
garnet
highlights
decent
head
the
smell
is
of
juicyfruit
gum
christmas
spices
and
dry
malt
taste
is
similar
but
slightly
watery
and
not
as
flavorful
as
the
nose
suggests
in
addition
to
the
aromas
being
echoed
in
the
flavors
there
is
a
nutty
finish
mouthfeeel
is
very
smooth
but
lighter
than
one
would
like
for
the
style
easy
drinking
but
a
little
boring
there
are
better
winter
warmers
out
there
also
i
thought
last
years
tasted
a
little
fuller
this
wasnt
a
bad
effort
from
sweetwater
the
flavors
were
festive
enough
and
it
was
ridiculously
quaffable
for
such
a
high
abv
worth
seeking
out
if
its
in
your
area
drinkability
is
excellent
well
balanced
great
big
caramelchocolatenut
combo
that
im
really
enjoying
this
is
one
fine
beer
man
is
this
a
good
beer
i
think
this
years
is
even
better
than
last
its
kind
of
refreshing
to
not
have
a
hop
bomb
of
a
dark
winter
beer
from
an
american
brewery
pick
up
a
bottle
or
try
it
on
tap
if
you
get
the
chance
you
will
not
be
sorry
overall
i
thought
this
was
very
nice
it
was
in
the
same
category
as
a
highland
cold
mountain
with
that
sweet
maple
like
taste
and
a
good
amount
of
wood
flavor
mixed
in
a
good
chunk
of
vanilla
also
mixed
in
as
you
let
the
taste
work
its
way
out
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
more
then
decent
and
i
look
forward
to
being
able
to
have
another
one
soon
a
nice
seasonal
from
sweetwater
pours
to
an
almost
black
thin
darkness
of
a
body
yeilds
a
one
inch
deep
tan
head
that
fades
in
just
a
couple
of
minutes
nose
is
a
sofr
malt
feel
with
rones
of
candy
like
coco
and
roasty
wood
very
smooth
as
you
take
first
sip
with
long
sweet
maltieness
and
a
balance
of
slightly
sour
wheat
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
nice
mineral
and
spice
mingling
happens
twords
the
end
of
the
palate
the
soft
sour
and
minerals
team
together
to
equal
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
tingle
on
the
tongue
nice
and
drinkable
even
as
it
warms
thanks
to
the
8
6
alchol
a
solid
holiday
style
this
one
is
pretty
good
its
not
your
standard
winter
warmer
maybe
a
little
spicier
than
average
but
its
still
a
great
beer
recommended
one
sip
was
all
i
needed
didnt
like
the
beer
at
all
very
honestly
it
tastes
like
a
bad
homebrew
made
of
leftover
ingredients
had
ontap
at
the
brewery
looks
dark
brown
some
light
gets
through
revealing
red
tints
not
much
of
a
head
nose
is
christmas
tree
potpourri
and
malt
taste
is
weak
malty
bread
with
some
more
holiday
spiciness
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
not
a
bad
offering
from
sweetwater
mouthfeel
was
ok
although
a
little
thin
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
that
has
enough
of
the
seasonal
flavor
to
it
well
worth
a
taste
or
two
taste
was
very
sweet
and
got
to
be
cloyingly
so
toward
the
end
sweet
and
malty
with
some
spices
like
ginger
and
a
raisinlike
fruity
flavor
also
some
chocolate
malt
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
pretty
creamy
but
cloyingly
sweet
overall
i
think
id
pass
on
this
if
i
saw
it
again
too
sweet
didnt
love
the
raisiny
flavor
and
there
are
better
holiday
beers
to
be
had
drinkability
its
alright
but
i
dare
say
ones
enough
for
me
per
year
d
great
warm
you
right
up
beer
enjoy
this
one
tailgating
before
the
big
game
with
a
rack
of
ribs
on
the
grill
very
drinkable
but
be
careful
the
8
6
will
get
hold
of
you
before
you
know
it
the
appearance
and
smell
of
this
beer
was
decent
however
there
is
just
too
much
ginger
used
for
my
preference
so
much
so
it
is
undrinkable
this
could
be
a
much
better
beer
if
they
backed
off
the
ginger
i
am
hoping
the
2007
edition
will
be
better
d
tasty
with
more
subtle
flavorspicing
than
other
holiday
beers
i
have
had
reminiscent
of
old
chub
really
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
not
such
a
good
deal
for
the
price
still
its
worth
a
try
and
the
bottle
is
super
slick
and
will
win
you
cool
points
at
parties
when
you
show
up
toting
it
as
usual
sweetwater
does
something
interesting
but
not
exactly
groundbreaking
drinks
very
easy
for
the
abv
but
needs
to
find
a
consistent
flavor
to
do
more
than
1
maybe
one
to
lay
down
for
a
year
the
head
pours
out
and
falls
away
into
nothing
the
smell
is
like
cheap
cheap
perfume
that
is
very
bad
oddly
enough
it
reminds
me
of
the
cleaners
that
we
used
back
in
2001
at
hardees
it
tastes
like
bad
roast
beef
layed
out
on
the
table
for
a
week
with
a
little
sweet
flowery
bouquet
of
the
cleaners
from
hardees
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
overall
the
drinkability
is
zero
never
again
pours
dark
in
colour
deep
auburn
with
lots
of
both
dark
and
light
highlights
pearly
white
bubbles
as
head
a
refreshing
aroma
of
spice
a
little
spicy
actually
notes
of
cardomom
fresh
green
tree
bark
spruce
and
a
whole
slew
of
spices
typical
of
a
pumpkin
ale
if
not
outwright
pumpkin
spices
carry
the
mouthfeel
too
nowhere
near
as
much
malt
or
hops
as
there
is
spice
which
works
ok
medium
bodied
fairly
light
drinking
especially
considering
the
alcohol
percentage
good
and
enjoyed

in

the
overall

lends
itself
to
be
a
quick
drinker
d
according
to
the
style
very
drinkable
i
appreciate
the
lightly
roasted
malt
taste
ive
recently
experienced
a
number
of
ales
that
have
gone
overboard
with
the
level
of
roasted
flavor
its
sweet
and
creamy
the
8
is
hidden
well
quite
drinkable
thanks
to
blitz134
for
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
this
one
i
will
drink
as
many
of
these
as
my
uncle
will
send
this
is
a
good
beer
for
this
15
degree
night
a
solid
offering
that
i
would
drink
again
thanks
to
barleywinebrewer
for
this
wonderful
winter
warmer
thanks
to
ba
hardtarget
for
sharing
this
rare
example
a
nice
zingy
winter
beer
the
serving
i
got
did
not
have
much
of
an
odor
but
i
have
never
had
an
exceptional
sense
of
smell
the
taste
however
is
fairly
good
the
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
or
remarkable
but
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
and
a
good
companion
to
a
hearty
lunch
or
dinner
it
goes
down
smoothly
without
a
bad
aftertaste
i
would
love
to
have
this
fresher
but
either
way
id
drink
this
again
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
light
tan
head
aroma
was
of
caramel
malts
and
holiday
spices
cinammon
nutmeg
and
ginger
were
all
present
in
the
nose
taste
was
a
good
mix
of
caramelly
malts
chocolate
and
spices
i
could
pick
up
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
as
the
beer
warmed
the
chocolatey
taste
became
more
evident
as
well
as
some
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
this
is
a
very
tasty
christmas
brew
that
warms
on
a
cold
night
i
plan
on
picking
up
another
sixer
if
i
can
find
it
curious
that
the
8
6
abv
is
not
listed
anywhere
on
the
bottle
as
nc
law
requires
drinkability
spices
tend
to
overwhelm
palate
with
time
spices
hid
8
6
abv
can
drink
a
few
but
it
will
hurt
a
very
tasty
interesting
beer
but
one
thats
hard
to
categorize
or
to
tease
out
the
dozens
of
flavors
in
something
id
buy
again
but
for
13
for
a
liter
ill
look
for
the
rumored
six
pack
this
beer
is
a
little
better
ontap
there
is
a
spiced
taste
to
this
brew
and
a
slight
bitterness
the
beer
is
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
a
hint
of
liqorice
in
there
too
overall
fair
for
the
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
drinkability
nice
flavor
profile
with
subtle
aromatics
not
sure
whether
the
recipe
has
changed
but
this
has
a
lot
more
character
than
what
i
tasted
a
few
years
ago
this
one
would
go
very
well
with
a
slowcooked
pot
roast
or
beef
stew
oh
what
the
heck
am
i
saying
this
is
dessert
pours
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
medium
offwhite
head
that
lasts
well
into
the
glass
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
somewhat
weak
but
what
it
there
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
malty
sweet
dark
fruit
some
choclate
and
spices
flavor
is
good
and
somewhat
spicy
but
fades
too
quickly
because
body
is
too
thin
and
watery
the
main
drawback
to
this
beer
is
the
stale
bitter
finish
that
leaves
a
licorice
aftertaste
not
a
terrible
holiday
brew
but
there
are
better
a
festive
ale
indeed
i
have
learned
to
expect
lighter
and
more
tame
brews
from
sweetwater
this
beer
surprises
with
a
heavier
malt
base
complexity
and
spiciness
looks
brown
through
and
through
with
a
tan
head
and
simple
lacing
smells
deeply
roasted
and
chocolatey
much
like
an
english
brown
this
brew
seems
to
have
added
chocolates
and
christmas
type
spices
that
are
shown
equally
in
the
nose
and
flavors
flavors
continue
with
a
bready
toasty
character
caramels
and
increasing
spiciness
feels
full
but
not
rich
never
thickens
or
waters
finishes
with
a
mild
alcohol
warmth
and
a
mild
bite
comming
from
the
spices
and
grains
nice

brew

the

fans
of

particularly
may
like
this
quite
a
bit
an
unusually
nice
offering
from
sweetwater
imho
this
beer
has
a
lightness
to
it
that
belies
the
fullness
of
the
body
it
has
a
medium
heft
to
it
and
just
starts
to
stick
to
the
palate
yet
it
is
quite
quaffable
still
it
might
even
be
too
quaffable
as
a
touch
more
meatiness
might
be
just
what
this
needs
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
definitely
fits
the
bill
as
a
winter
seasonal
thanks
to
mark
for
the
trade
the
2006
release
i
have
also
had
the
2004
and
2005
but
i
think
this
year
is
somewhat
different
pours

deep
burgandy

black
with
an
average
sized
offwhite
head
which
falls
to
a
thin
layer
of
cream
within
a
minute
or
two
very
little
aroma
to
this
one
i
think
previous
years
exhibited
more
hop
aroma
virtually
none
here
smells
of
roasted
grains
plums
a
hint
of
chocoloate
nice
full
body
sweet
taste
of
berries
cranberry
and
plum
most
notably
with
roasted
malt
flavor
little
to
no
bitterness
it
seems
to
lack
some
of
the
spicy
bite
that
i
recall
from
previous
years
and
seems
much
more
like
some
sort
of
berry
ale
this
beer
will
go
great

with

dry

i
could
not
detect
very
much
spice
presence
overall
though
and
was
surprised
by
the
fact
that
this
is
classified
as
spiced
beer
since
i
honestly
though
it
was
a
porter
d
ultimately
a
bit
too
overspiced
by
the
end
of
the
huge
bottle
it
had
become
a
bit
too
much
bottle
is
dated
2005
pours
dark
brown
with
some
burgundy
color
as
well
smells
of
sweet
malts
dates
prunes
and
caramel
also
some
roasty
aroma
in
there
medium
body
with
sweet
malts
dominating
up
front
in
the
taste
with
some
roasty
and
smoky
flavors
as
well
in
the
background
that
tingle
on
the
tongue
good
beer
i
may
enjoy
it
more
during
the
winter
months
not
my
favorite
beer
here
just
seems
off
not
recommended
drinkability
great
loved
the
flavor
a
real
standout
in
a
pretty
mediocre
style
too
bad
i
cant
get
no
more
still
enjoyed
this
one
2005
bottle
6305
of
7200
quite
an
impressive
33
8fl
oz
waxed
swing
top
bottlepoured
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
tint
thru
out
with
a
nice
slow
forming
offwhite
head
that
is
gone
pretty
fast
after
it
forms
deep
roasted
maltmolasses
and
a
touch
of
nutmeg
a
malt
bomb
here
a
thinner
but
not
watery
mouthfeel
but
i
thought
it
would
be
a
little
fullerflavors
start
on
the
sweeter
side
molasses
and
brown
sugar
dominate
a
touch
of
cherry
as
well
but
not
to
much
spicea
nice
dryinf
earthy
finish
shows
there
is
some
hops
in
there
it
comes
in
a
fancy
package
and
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
for
10
00
bucks
a
bottle
i
wouldnt
buy
again
flavor
is
a
bit
over
the
top
and
out
of
balance
with
a
bucket
full
of
spices
and
a
healthy
does
of
alcohol
heat
sweet
malts
are
quickly
followed
by
the
spices
full
body
that
really
clings
to
the
sinuses
after
the
swallow
warming
on
the
way
down
and
quite
soothing
kind
of
like
a
brandy
actually
have
to
fight
through
the
wax
before
the
1l
swingtop
bottle
pours
out
a
deep
and
dark
almost
black
liquid
and
ruby
highlights
announce
themselves
in
the
light
a
huge
head
of
cappuccino
colored
bubbles
small
and
densely
packed
slowly
settles
to
a
thin
surface
coat
leaving
almost
no
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
there
are
hints
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
some
alcohol
the
taste
matches
the
smell
sweet
and
spicy
slightly
bitter
coffee
notes
arise
and
there
is
a
moderate
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
rich
full
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
on
the
subdued
side
highly
drinkable
and
if
this
were
the
only
beer
being
offered
on
a
given
night
out
id
be
pretty
happy
a
little
thin
lightly
carbonated
enjoyable
beer
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
good
this
was
my
first
sweetwater
offering
nice
winter
warmer
one
id
like
to
try
again
in
the
future
poors
dark
brown
with
head
that
soon
dissipates
to
a
film
smell
is
good
with
noticable
spices
interesting
taste
with
several
different
flavors
slight
carmel
taste
some
coffee
and
several
spices
that
are
hard
to
pick
out
leaves
the
drinker
with
a
warming
feeling
after
a
glass
or
two
very
good
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
this
is
quite
darker
than
i
expected
it
is
a
brownred
there
is
a
sizable
frothy
head
that
holds
nicely
it
smells
sweet
and
malty
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
going
on
with
the
taste
but
it
is
not
very
strong
first
of
all
i
notice
that
it
is
balanced
nicely
between
hops
and
malts
i
can
detect
some
pine
cinnamon
and
possibly
something
roasted
and
nutty
it
feels
thick
and
is
carbonated
well
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
drinkability
is
good
but
due
to
cost
wouldnt
purchase
on
a
regular
basis
as
others
are
better
and
cheaper
taste
wonderful
in
the
mouth
with
a
creamy
and
velvety
mouthfeel
minimally
hopped
but
never
cloying
sweet
malt
character
is
accented
by
holiday
spices
and
the
spiciness
is
further
accentuated
by
a
slight
alcohol
presence
finishes
clean
and
is
remarkably
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
size
and
nature
sweetwater
festive
ale
has
an
overpowering
kitchen
sink
taste
that
causes
the
drinker
to
notice
new
flavors
with
every
sip
because
of
the
taste
profile
i
would
consider
this
an
extreme
beer
as
it
is
not
what
i
would
grab
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
your
average
stout
or
porter
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
that
everyone
should
try
but
i
do
not
see
myself
quaffing
this
beverage
often
i
drank
this
from
a
pint
glass
where
it
had
a
nice
cream
colored
head
that
lasted
til
about
halfway
through
the
pint
the
smell
was
something
like
a
spice
cake
or
gingerbread
the
taste
followed
this
up
the
beer
was
heavy
on
the
tongue
and
smooth
going
down
it
would
be
great
served
with
desert
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
like
your
winter
warmers
without
the
spices
being
overdone
large
bombersized
bottle
grolschstyle
swingtop
covered
in
thick
red
wax
wax
was
rather
difficult
to
remove
gracefully
but
well
worth
the
effort
brew
was
much
darker
than
i
was
expecting
a
nice
almostblack
color
very
little
head
nice
aroma
on
this
one
hint
of
cardamom
spice
reminiscent
of
an
anchor
xmas
brew
taste
was
unexpected
there
was
a
stong
smoke
flavor
to
the
brew
not
unlike
a
good
rausch
style
the
smokey
flavor
was
distinct
not
unlike
maple
bacon
the
hops
offset
the
strong
malt
note
resulting
in
an
enjoyable
experience
the
bottle
was
numbered
to
indicate
that
only
7200
bottles
of
this
sucker
are
avaible
so
grab
one
while
you
can
i
had
number
3499
body
hovers
between
medium
and
large
with
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
chalky
mouthfeel
aside
from
this
being
a
bit
darker
than
i
would
have
expected
everything
else
i
was
deadon
about
it
poured
a
very
dense
dark
chocolate
brown
through
which
light
could
hardly
pass
no
head
the
smell
was
hoppier
than
i
care
for
which
i
predicted
it
would
be
a
bit
of
malt
present
which
is
what
i
enjoy
but
plenty
of
hops
no
thanks
the
taste
was
the
same
as
the
smell
a
greater
presence
of
hops
than
malt
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
however
theres
little
carbonation
and
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
has
a
very
very
slight
heaviness
to
it
or
rather
what
i
think
im
trying
to
say
is
that
there
is
a
consistency
here
that
seems
a
bit
thicker
than
one
might
expect
not
like
syrup
but
certainly
more
dense
than
water
overall
i
probably
will
never
buy
this
again
it
certainly
isnt
terrible
but
it
certainly
isnt
for
me
either
i
really
didnt
care
for
it
that
much
but
it
sure
does
have
a
smooth
finish
and
at
8
6
itll
do
the
trick
in
a
hurry
ill
be
looking
for
it
next
year
no
doubt
thanks
to
rajendra82
for
sending
out
this
georgia
treat
not
a
bad
effort
from
sweetwater
but
i
thought
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
cloying
this
beer
had
a
slight
toasted
aroma
mixed
with
nutmeg
and
clove
with
a
hint
of
coriander
there
was
virtually
zero
head
i
could
just
get
the
head
to
cover
the
surface
but
it
disappeared
instantly
the
body
was
a
clear
black
brown
initial
flavor
was
midly
sweet
that
finished
long
body
was
medium
to
full
with
a
syrupy
texture
virtually
no
carbonation
the
finish
was
only
slightly
alcoholic
surpisingly
little
for
a
8
9
beer
seems
to
taste
a
little
less
spicy
than
last
years
model
aged
quite
well
not
bad
and
a
nice
winter
brew
enjoyed
in
the
summer
screw
seasonal
stereotypes
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
decent
head
retention
here
smells
and
tastes
like
a
belgian
dubbel
rum
spices
ripe
fruits
greet
you
as
you
taste
this
beer
i
find
this
has
a
fuller
body
than
most
belgian
dubbels
that
ive
had
and
a
much
more
rounded
character
still
it
does
seem
a
bit
sharp
in
the
mouth
to
me
the
alcohol
is
blended
in
nicely
too
not
noticable
at
all
a
very
interesting
offering
sweet
complex
luscious
and
alcoholic
a
fine
beer
could
definitely
use
some
fine
tuning
2003
vintage
bottle
2675
could
not
have
been
above
6
abv
in
2003
due
to
ga
laws
33
8
ounce
large
swingtop
bottle
covered
with
way
that
made
the
bottle
near
impossible
to
open
im
very
glad
i
purchased
it
even
though
it
was
about
16
at
sherlocks
cold
case
in
marietta
ga
the
price
is
the
only
sticking
point
not
great
kind
of
like
anchor
christmas
gone
wrong
too
much
spice
lackluster
very
tasty
ale
very
admirable
rich
and
full
in
body
but
a
nice
mellow
darkfruity
finish
and
no
particular
flavors
poisoning
its
appeal
to
the
average
joe
unless
a
j
needs
only
fizzy
yellow
crap
but
im
offmessage
now
and
ill
just
enjoy
this
for
the
duration
this
is
a
very
nice
diversion
from
all
the
one
endures
in
the
wintertime
especially
those
of
us
us
here
in
the
states
where
we
feel
the
weather
on
multitudinal
levels
i
congratulate
sweetwater
for
not
only
creating
this
beer
but
for
packaging
it
in
such
a
unique
fashion
as
a
holidaystyle
beer
though
its
just
allrighty
drinkability
is
solid
if
you
can
find
it
try
it
interesting
combination
of
lighter
spices
with
a
darker
malt
profile
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
and
has
a
chocolate
character
and
a
little
spice
the
flavor
is
very
nice
chocolate
flavors
along
with
a
spice
from
the
ginger
make
it
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
id
definately
have
this
one
again
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
ginger
in
there
with
a
background
of
chocolate
that
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
also
first
highlighted
with
a
ginger
flavor
that
fades
to
a
chocolate
on
the
finish
i
like
it
a
lot
the
feel
is
a
touch
thin
but
the
other
characteristics
of
the
beer
make
up
for
that
overall
the
beer
is
smooth
and
just
damn
good
thanks
to
clvand0
for
sharing
this
awesome
beer
with
me
a
very
good
beer
interesting
with
the
spices
and
malty
balance
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
i
was
happy
that
we
had
a
few
bottles
to
share
comparing
the
two
im
wondering
if
there
is
a
happy
medium
to
aging
this
beer
and
if
i
have
enough
of
this
years
stock
to
find
it
poured
a
nice
cocacola
brown
with
a
offwhite
to
tan
one
finger
head
on
it
which
disappeared
rather
quickly
to
a
slight
coating
on
the
surface
aroma
was
a
bit
dull
to
me
not
as
pronounced
as
i
was
expecting
woodsy
smells
waft
to
the
edge
of
the
glass
with
slight
overtones
of
a
concoction
of
spices
no
single
spice
stands
out
to
me
though
the
taste
is
rather
good
and
coats
the
mouth
well
the
flavor
is
mostly
dominated
by
toasted
malts
with
a
slight
alcoholic
sweetness
i
dont
pick
up
on
too
many
spices
in
the
taste
i
could
see
having
several
of
these
in
an
evening
but
the
sweetness
could
knock
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
a
very
good
seasonal
this
review
was
done
on
a
2003
version
that
is
nearly
a
year
old
i
dont
think
cellaring
this
would
be
a
good
idea
but
it
certainly
has
some
staying
power
its
a
complex
taste
thats
in
your
face
but
is
a
bit
too
overpowering
in
burnt
flavors
id
like
to
taste
it
again
after
its
aged
and
the
flavor
has
smoothed
out
a
bit
regardless
a
very
satisfying
brew
that
will
fill
you
with
warmth
when
its
cold
outside
a
fair
bodied
fair
winter
beer
thanks
to
aracauna
for
this
warmer
first
sip
very
mild
carbonation
very
smooth
with
above
average
thickness
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
scent
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
coffee
but
more
of
a
mocha
similar
to
those
swiss
mocha
hard
candies
they
give
out
at
banks
sometimes
that
is
exactly
what
i
taste
very
easy
to
drink
no
abv
listed
but
i
guess
it
is
above
6
but
not
due
to
alcohol
flavor
or
burn
just
thickness
of
the
brew
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
not
what
i
expected
from
a
winter
ale
but
i
am
very
impressed
with
my
first
sweetwater
beverage
now
i
know
what
to
look
for
next
time
i
am
in
georgia
thanks
again
for
a
quality
brew
rajendra
in
the
end
the
fact
that
i
not
only
get
used
to
the
coffee
flavor
but
happily
finish
the
pint
and
look
forward
to
another
says
a
great
deal
about
the
quality
of
this
beer
i
love
it
when
i
say
i
dont
like
this
type
of
beer
and
the
beer
says
oh
yeah
are
you
sure
about
that
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
wonderful
progression
of
tastes
flies
by
too
fast
this
is
probably
because
the
strength
and
persistence
of
the
coffee
flavor
dulls
my
taste
buds
so
that
the
more
subtle
flavors
go
under
my
radar
i
imagine
that
for
people
who
like
coffee
to
begin
with
this
beer
must
be
truly
spectacular
thanks
rajendra82
for
a
great
trade
really
got
me
in
the
mood
for
more
winterholiday
seasonals
i
received
2
bottles
courtesy
of
rajendra82
and
i
will
be
cellaring
the
remaining
one
for
further
review
in
the
future
next
winter
if
i
can
wait
no
promises
this
is
the
second
sweetwater
brew
i
have
sampled
and
i
must
say
that
i
have
liked
both
it
is
a
shame
that
sweetwater
is
not
readily
available
where
i
live
this
is
certainly
a
brewery
that
deserves
some
more
exposure
tasted
in
a
12oz
bottle
in
1103
as
a
month
old
brew
thanks
aracauna
for
pointing
me
in
the
direction
of
the
store
where
i
found
this
rare
gem
now
i
have
a
couple
of
six
packs
sitting
in
the
fridge
and
a
few
more
in
the
pantry
ill
be
saving
these
and
updating
the
review
as
it
ages
if
i
can
resist
the
temptation
to
finish
them
off
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
gorgeous
looking
dark
red
concoction
with
a
tall
off
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
invisible
line
of
bubbles
carbonation
is
pretty
low
and
so
is
the
amount
of
belgian
lace
it
is
a
perfect
winter
brew
with
lots
of
roasted
caramel
malt
backbone
and
a
high
abv
for
georgia
that
is
balanced
out
by
the
explosive
level
of
spices
and
distinctively
floral
hoppy
aroma
warms
you
up
nicely
as
it
goes
down
easy
as
i
taste
it
the
temperature
outside
is
near
60
degrees
this
will
be
perfect
when
i
get
stuck
at
the
house
with
about
a
14
inch
of
snow
on
the
roads
outside
after
all
this
is
atlanta
another
quality
product
from
sweetwater
that
should
not
be
missed
by
anyone
that
can
get
their
hands
on
it
dark
brown
like
cocacola
and
a
dense
off
white
head
interesting
aroma
has
some
smoky
roasted
malt
and
a
good
dose
of
hops
along
with
a
hint
of
ginger
pretty
smooth
body
with
a
nice
crispness
to
it
flavor
is
spicy
sweet
with
a
good
malt
flavor
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
sweetwater
111202
dark
dark
ruby
almost
black
light
khaki
head
lasts
a
while
the
aroma
is
brown
sugar
pumpernickel
bread
and
toffee
the
flavor
is
really
earthy
and
woody
kind
of
like
the
smell
of
a
forest
after
a
rain
with
the
rottings
logs
and
new
growth
what
im
assuming
is
the
mace
comes
on
a
little
strong
while
the
cinammon
is
faint
enough
that
i
dont
notice
it
the
alcohol
tickles
around
the
edges
of
the
palate
but
is
covered
fairly
well
overall
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
had
from
sweetwater
a
pleasant
blend
of
spices
and
malts
that
make
for
holiday
merrymaking
anytime
you
open
one
the
only
down
side
to
this
beer
is
trying
to
open
it
fifteen
minutes
with
a
swiss
army
knife
and
you
can
finally
open
the
plastic
and
metal
swing
top
coated
in
hard
red
wax
there
has
to
be
a
better
way
to
seal
a
bottle
without
buying
a
corking
and
caging
machine
overall
this
is
a
medium
bodied
slightly
spicey
beer
quite
tasty
this
is
a
nicely
done
winter
ale
that
isnt
too
overpowering
poured
a
walnut
brown
overall
it
struck
me
as
anchor
our
special
ales
little
brother
nutty
mildly
spiced
nutmeg
and
allspice
with
a
lively
mouthfeel
a
touch
of
carmel
and
maple
syrup
but
not
too
sweet
the
beer
pours
a
light
hazy
brown
color
the
head
preposterous
in
size
with
a
frothy
consistency
and
the
lace
thick
sheets
that
hold
mightily
to
the
glass
sweet
and
spicy
over
ripe
apples
or
plums
cant
make
up
what
little
mind
i
have
left
caramel
chocolate
and
lot
of
malt
in
this
pleasing
to
the
schnozzle
beer
the
outset
is
ambrosial
the
top
is
middling
in
mouth
feel
and
the
hops
take
a
front
seat
in
this
beer
with
a
perky
acidity
and
a
droughty
long
lasting
aftertaste
as
i
have
said
before
sweetwater
and
dogwood
make
some
quite
quaffable
brews
and
well
worth
the
hunt
this
seasonal
is
in
the
same
class
as
the
anchor
osa
a
rich
hearty
full
flavored
ale
very
flavorful
and
noticable
warming
alcohol
prescence
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
one
wish
i
had
more
cheers
to
aracauna
for
the
trade
and
bringing
this
one
to
our
attention
a
fantastic
seasonal
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
sweetwater
festive
ale
has
many
nuttynutmeggy
notes
to
it
it
reminds
me
of
christmas
very
very
tasty
on
the
sweetwater
tour
they
said
it
doesnt
take
much
to
get
you
fucked
up
as
this
beer
sports
a
very
strong
alcohol
content
bonus
o
very
drinkable
not
overly
sweet
bitter
or
spicy
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
over
roasted
malts
and
the
bitter
spices
lead
to
a
not
overly
pleasant
aftertaste
i
am
not
sure
but
it
seems
my
taste
buds
are
either
evolving
or
i
was
overrating
the
beers
of
the
past
i
get
a
subdued
chocolate
malt
and
hint
of
wintergreen
and
clove
the
sorts
of
spices
for
wintery
baking
thinly
bodied
with
less
medicinal
character
than
what
i
remember
from
years
past
slightly
roasty
balanced
with
a
perfect
amount
of
spices
to
add
to
the
complexity
without
overwhelming
the
experience
very
nice
xmas
ale
smooth
and
rich
with
spices
and
alcohol
warmth
what
a
fantastic
beer
i
cannot
think
of
a
better
christmas
beer
o
a
decent
christmas
brew
though
as
is
often
the
case
with
this
series
the
spice
hamstrings
the
overall
character
looks
great
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
showcase
a
mix
of
spice
piny
hops
and
sweet
malt
rather
harsh
bitterness
on
the
finish
good
body
goes
down
nicely
enough
just
a
shame
the
harshness
isnt
more
attenuated
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
o
a
decent
drink
but
the
alcohol
and
cherry
dont
mesh
too
well
in
this
one
a
nice
beer
to
have
in
a
bar
though
an
interesting
beer
and
if
you
havent
tried
a
few
years
of
these
christmas
beers
theyre
a
must
historically
speaking
but
that
doesnt
mean
theyre
all
that
drinkable
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
fog
hill
market
in
san
francisco
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
with
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
producing
2
fingers
of
beige
somewhat
lasting
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
half
inch
wash
of
pasty
lace
above
the
surface
collar
aroma
is
caramel
dark
bready
malt
with
spice
notes
of
cinnamon
ginger
maybe
nutmeg
hints
of
cherry
prune
roasted
nuts
a
faint
sourness
taste
is
dark
malt
bready
spice
heavy
to
cinnamon
ginger
with
sweet
caramel
dark
tart
cherry
pruneplums
finishes
with
orange
herbal
hops
producing
an
earthy
note
giving
way
to
a
caramel
spice
lightly
roasted
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
tongue
coating
slightly
wet
fronted
but
rapidly
drying
after
midsip
light
pepper
prickle
always
a
holiday
fave
look
for
it
before
its
gone
o
i
enjoyed
the
spicemalt
play
and
found
this
to
be
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
robust
flavors
of
mulling
spices
and
a
firm
caramel
base
a
good
choice
for
a
holiday
evening
not
a
big
fan
of
christmas
spices
i
find
that
the
malt
flavors
balance
out
the
spice
and
pine
to
yield
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
plenty
of
complexity
odd
taste
at
first
but
overall
good
carmel
taste
has
a
very
strong
winter
ale
spice
to
it
good
if
thats
what
you
like
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
bad
way
flavor
and
mouthful
just
werent
right
5
5
seems
a
bit
low
for
the
style
as
well
3
535
not
my
thing
but
still
a
quality
brew
overall
while
i
could
drink
this
i
did
not
care
for
it
i
do
not
care
for
this
style
of
beer
prost
o
disappointing
nice
pour
from
bottle
to
stone
imperial
porter
tulip
glass
dark
maple
syrup
color
body
with
a
good
taupe
1
and
a
half
inch
of
bubbly
not
over
thick
head
smells
of
allspice
and
caramel
tastes
like
it
too
very
drinkable
and
could
easily
sit
down
for
2
of
these
in
a
row
i
could
swear
i
really
enjoyed
anchors
christmas
brew
a
few
years
back
but
im
starting
to
wonder
if
my
tastes
have
simply
changed
this
isnt
at
all
like
what
i
recall
o
superb
and
much
better
than
the
2013
version
which
i
remember
tasting
like
i
had
drank
a
juniper
bush
a
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
taste
wise
very
similar
to
sam
adams
old
fezziwig
but
its
available
in
sixpacks
will
drink
again
for
some
reason
when
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
anchor
at
the
ungodly
price
of
13
99
i
assumed
the
anchor
christmas
ale
was
a
barleywine
or
other
strong
dark
type
beer
well
obviously
i
was
thinking
of
a
different
annual
wintertime
beer
this
one
pours
very
dark
brown
in
my
chalice
and
has
a
wicked
funky
fruity
aroma
im
getting
candied
prunes
cinnamon
ginger
and
some
fruits
and
spices
that
remind
me
of
rich
fruitcake
but
im
embarrassed
to
admit
i
cant
identify
scores
bonus
points
on
smell
simply
on
account
of
intrigue
very
creamy
mouthfeel
temperature
is
offcool
flavor
matches
the
aroma
really
this
is
like
drinking
a
fruitcake
i
suppose
thats
a
very
reasonable
match
for
the
winter
warmer
genre
finish
is
not
at
all
dry
neither
unpleasant
nor
sweet
but
not
dry
either
just
uncrisp
overall
im
very
happy
to
have
tried
and
consumed
this
but
im
not
sure
that
enjoyment
is
enough
to
justify
the
other
5
bottles
i
purchased
my
grandfather
has
been
getting
a
case
of
these
beers
since
1975
at
first
he
just
drank
them
then
in
1983
started
saving
a
few
each
year
and
let
them
sit
after
a
couple
of
years
hell
open
one
the
oldest
ive
had
being
15
years
i
have
to
say
aging
does
wonders
it
really
mellows
out
the
flavor
and
makes
for
an
extremely
good
christmas
brew
my
opinion
age
the
beer
and
youll
get
something
totally
different
but
very
good
overall
a
winter
seasonal
classic
spice
blend
evokes
christmas
trees
instead
of
sweet
gingerbread
meh
i
get
some
licoriceanise
and
some
dark
fruits
i
dont
like
this
beer
a
good
year
for
anchor
nice
malt
and
spice
without
being
overwhelming
or
cloyingly
sweet
appearance
of
a
brown
ale
but
roasting
used
with
a
light
hand
better
than
in
recent
years
not
a
malty
mess
some
spice
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
it
still
could
be
better
but
given
recent
years
a
huge
improvement
decent
to
pretty
good
winter
warmer
andits
always
worth
savoring
at
least
one
every
winter
not
what
i
expected
from
anchor
not
what
i
like
alot
deep
rich
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
tan
that
stands
up
nicely
caramel
toasty
malt
on
the
nose
with
just
a
hit
of
unidentifiable
spice
taste
is
toffee
caramel
malt
flavors
with
nicely
balanced
spice
that
reminded
me
of
nutmeg
star
anise
cinnamon
and
grains
of
paradise
what
spices
are
in
the
brew
are
so
nicely
integrated
that
none
dominate
creating
a
harmonious
spice
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
winter
brew
nice
toasty
malt
notes
and
spice
this
beer
was
great
this
year
a
perfect
balance
between
a
chocolatey
malt
and
a
citus
hoppy
flavor
light
gingerbread
and
spice
smell
but
i
am
getting
a
very
wet
taste
and
a
weak
body
and
mouthfeel
maybe
its
just
an
off
year
a
bit
of
an
overpowering
spice
character
to
this
otherwise
i
find
it
to
be
quite
and
agreeable
and
complex
xmas
ale
quite
satisfying
worth
seeking
out
o
the
2014
version
tastes
and
smells
better
than
i
remember
the
past
few
years
i
it
is
becoming
a
yearly
tradition
for
me
happy
christmas
overall
not
bad
but
far
from
my
favorite
christmas
beer
nicely
spiced
a
little
heavy
for
me
but
not
alcohol
high
at
5
5
perhaps
my
tastes
are
changing
not
my
favorite
year
but
i
wont
have
problems
taking
down
this
giant
bottle
solo
dark
in
color
with
a
very
good
head
tasted
very
good
seasonal
beer
that
goes
down
easy
with
a
fairly
strong
after
taste
overall
definitely
a
solid
christmas
beer
but
just
a
little
too
much
pine
and
spice
still
when
a
picking
a
christmas
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
not
a
great
flavor
spices
were
too
much
to
handle
conclusion
from
reading
patrick
dawsons
book
this
appears
to
be
a
beer
that
truly
improves
after
13
years
of
aging
i
bought
my
first
6
pack
for
that
reason
but
wanted
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
as
a
reference
i
really
like
this
beer
as
it
is
and
am
glad
i
drank
it
above
fridge
temp
this
will
become
yet
another
yearly
winter
seasonal
that
i
must
have
winter
is
my
favorite
season
for
beer
and
the
list
of
must
have
seasonals
is
getting
long
solid
holiday
brew
from
the
company
that
turned
me
on
to
real
beer
merry
christmas
not
great
as
it
should
after
that
it
went
downhill
the
flavor
profile
is
uneven
and
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
here
beyond
a
nice
but
basic
malty
bready
ale
overall
this
years
version
of
our
special
ale
is
as
usual
a
solid
well
made
beer
that
i
think
ill
try
and
find
a
few
more
bottles
of
to
share
with
some
friends
during
the
remaining
holiday
season
parties
it
might
even
be
tasty
to
nonbeer
drinkers
still
a
nice
seasonal
tradition
with
a
good
drinkable
presentation
underrated
nice
subtle
christmas
spruce
flavor
layered
on
top
of
that
iconic
steam
profile
of
anchors
a
great
gentle
holiday
beer
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
but
it
seems
a
bit
subdued
and
slightly
weaker
this
time
around
otherwise
pretty
fine
awesome
all
over
great
holiday
beer
overall
its
very
lacking
for
a
winter
warmer
without
the
ginger
its
just
another
year
round
beer
with
the
ginger
its
a
disappointing
winter
beer
not
heavy
or
cloying
like
a
lot
of
winter
warmers
nice
light
spicy
fruitcakedried
fruit
flavors
happening
here
not
one
i
need
a
whole
lot
of
but
im
happy
i
gave
it
a
shot
after
2013s
roastymolasses
ale
overall
easy
drinking
flavorful
although
not
overly
complex
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
the
style
i
started
to
loose
a
little
hope
because
of
the
aroma
but
when
i
got
to
the
taste
it
turned
out
to
be
much
more
balanced
and
the
spices
were
bolder
but
not
overpowering
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
crisp
fairly
creamy
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
couple
of
these
around
the
holidays
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
good
and
i
thought
the
balance
in
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
aroma
it
wasnt
bad
it
was
just
unbalanced
and
a
little
boring
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
another
bottle
or
two
before
they
are
all
gone
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
balanced
winter
warmer
i
think
it
fits
the
style
nicely
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
winter
warmer
it
didnt
really
impress
more
or
anything
but
it
did
live
up
to
being
a
nice
winter
warmer
its
not
my
favorite
anchor
beer
and
i
would
say
its
above
average
for
the
style
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
solid
beer
keep
up
the
hard
work
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
beer
is
not
as
heavy
as
i
would
prefer
for
the
style
i
would
prefer
a
higher
abv
winter
warmer
style
ale
but
if
you
want
a
sessionable
rendition
this
might
work
for
you
spices
are
often
thrown
around
for
holiday
beers
and
it
just
doesnt
work
this
beer
breaks
the
mold
and
lets
them
really
shine
i
think
this
years
celebration
was
better
than
the
2013
incredible
i
loved
this
beer
a
seasonal
favorite
pours
an
almost
impenetrably
dark
red
thick

mediumheavy
bodied
somewhat
slippery
mouthfeel
spices
not
overdone
why
wont
it
allow
me
to
just
give
a
rating
they
seem
to
get
better
year
after
year
cola

deep
brown
with
a

a
bit

leaves
some
spotty

down
the

of
holiday
spice
burnt
crust
earth
and
toffee
taste
brings
holiday
spices
up
front
with
toffee
and
burnt
caramel
hit
mid
palate
the
spice
fades
and
gives
way
to
a
burnt
toast
like
flavor
with
some
mild
hop
presence
on
the
finish
the
taste
leaves
an
odd
aftertaste
of
char
and
mushroom
i
think
that
i
dont
care
for
top
end
of
thin
body
sharp
carbonation
and
a
semi
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
try
a
couple
of
each
year
but
this
years
version
had
me
asking
myself
why
a
fingers
of
of
crisp
slightly
lopsided
partially
fizzy

colored
froth
modest
retention

the
flavor
profile
isnt
quite
what
i
expected
much
of
the
malty
goodness
disappears
and
is
replaced
by
a
sturdy
but
unremarkable
profile
some
light
piney
notes
lots
of
earthy
and
woody
notes
some
faint
medicinal
notes
slightly
smokey
as
well
in
interesting

flavors
but
not
quite
sure
they
work
well
together
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
slightly
chalky
texture
light
yet
crisp
carbonation
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
annual
offering
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
ive
had
the
majority
of
these
offerings
since
becoming
a
ba
some
ten
years
ago
and
unfortunately
this
may
be
one
of
if
not
my
least
favorite
but
all
that
said
its
still
a
drinkable
beer
and
still
fits
the
season
nicely

heremaybe
a
little
unorganized
but
a
different
take
on
the
beer
this
year
pours
a
deep
clear
chestnut
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
holds
on
for
quite
a
while
and
leaves
fine
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
interesting
with
maybe
allspice
or
mace
and
some
dark
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
good
unique
the
body
is
lighter
but
has
a
nice
silky
quality
to
it
serving
type
bottle
while
not
a
session
beer
this
was
weak
enough
in
alcohol
and
taste
that
i
could
have
easily
had
another
in
a
sitting
since
ive
had
so
many
of
these
ill
continue
to
buy
this
year
after
year
but
i
hope
that
this
goes
back
to
a
more
traditional
recipe
next
year
the
2014
take
on
this
was
too
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
and
lacking
in
the
tree
bark
and
natural
tone
that
made
this
such
a
winner
in
the
past
hopefully
its
just
an
aberration
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
cinnamon
cookies
allspice
and
cherries
exceptional
this
year
rjt
o
this
was
tough
for
me
the
harshness
was
a
little
overwhelming
all
those
toasted
spicy
and
woody
flavors
trend
rich
with
tannin
pepper
and
spice
as
their
aromatic
and
flavor
value
recede
and
the
tactile
palate
receives
the
bitterness
mild
astringency
and
simmering
warmth
from
alcohol
in
a
most
rustic
and
charming
of
ways
nice
dark
malt
with
hints
of
winter
spices
not
the
best
for
me
solid
christmas
beer
not
over
powering
spices
but
very
drinkable
not
my
favorite
recipe
but
thats
the
price
you
pay
for
a
different
recipe
every
year
pours
a
dark
brown
color
very
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
tan
head
lots
of
stick
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
spicy
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
very
nice
malty
slightly
sweet
a
good
dose
of
toffeecaramel
medium
body
overall
a
nice
brew
would
buy
again
but
it
does
not
remind
me
of
the
early
vintages
spiced
brown
ale
real
easy
going
thin
body
with
a
lower
carbonation
level
i
detect
fresh
cream
milk
chocolate
and
ginger
on
the
tongue
the
aftertaste
has
the
aforementioned
nutmeg
along
with
something
id
describe
as
unsweetened
cola
not
as
complex
as
past
years
offerings
for
all
those
who
scored
this
a
3
i
would
like
a
recommendation
on
another
to
try
i
found
the
anchor
to
provide
the
warmth
of
a
malty
wintery
ale
but
with
light
spices
and
hoppiness
to
smooth
the
bitter
notes
im
only
bummed
my
local
shop
sells
sixers
for
12
99
and
16
barrels
north
of
120
disappointed
by
this
beer
had
a
great
aroma
to
start
with
cardamom
and
clove
to
kick
things
off
not
nearly
enough
malt
sweetness
for
a
winter
warmer
bitter
fruit
and
burnt
malt
flavorings
were
off
putting
mouthfeel
wasnt
that
appealing
either
slightly
too
dry
perhaps
from
the
carbonation
but
astringent
in
an
unappealing
way
glad
i
bought
a
single
bottle
to
give
this
anchor
offering
a
ride
very
flavorful
this
year
nice
holiday
spice
good
amount
of
caramel
malt
but
still
nicely
hopped
pours
dark
redbrown
clour
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
disappears
soon
leaving
some
lace
smell
of
chocolate
and
spices
nutmeg
vanilla
soft
palate
taste
of
chocolate
and
spices
nutmeg
vanilla
cherries
cardamom
or
clove
and
maybe
allspices
i
wish
i
liked
anchor
beer
more
a
fine
yet
somehow
uninspiring
spiced
red
ale
malty
and
yeasty
front
nose
burnt
gingerbread
nutmeg
orange
peel
back
medium
bodied
slightly
flat
pronounced
alcohol
warmth
enjoyable
sitting
by
the
crackling
fire
two
was
slightly
more
than
enough
still
a
totally
reasonable
option
for
the
thanksgiving
table
o
overall
very
enjoyable
buy
some
before
its
all
gone

pretty
typical
special
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
i
get
the
prototypical
clove
ginger
bread
and
holly
on
the
nose
and
palate
on
a
brown
ale
frame
while
nothing
extraordinary
this
is
a
tasty
christmas
ale
with
a
nice
amount
of
spice
alcohol
is
very
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
and
so
drinkability
is
pretty
good
enjoyed
this
as
always
but
one
was
really
enough
for
me
overall
im
not
laying
this
down
too
similar
to
the
notes
of
the
2013
i
recently
had
and
it
didnt
seem
to
benefit
from
aging
much
at
all
serving
type
bottle
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
coloring
deep
and
opaque
with
a
sparse
filmy
bubbly
light
tan
head
aromas
of
caramel
molasses
chocolate
roasted
notes
cinnamon
nutmeg
cream
highlights
hints
of
wood
spice
and
some
subtle
pine
pitch
flavors
are
robust
and
rich
forward
with
a
blast
of
cocoa
nibs
toffee
caramel
and
molasses
all
on
a
roasted
slightly
charred
backbone
spice
blend
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
all
spice
and
clove
as
well
as
some
evergreen
and
resinous
notes
subtle
cream
and
vanilla
highlights
lighten
things
up
a
bit
the
beer
has
a
smooth
light
body
with
an
underlying
bitter
roast
character
throughout
and
well
into
the
aftertaste
tangy
sweet
combo
in
the
aftertaste
with
all
the
richly
sweet
flavors
hanging
around
the
finish
is
smooth
with
a
roasted
sweet
linger
nice
job
this
year
unlike
last
years
offering
this
years
special
ale
fell
short
of
the
mark
dark
beer
on
the
pour
with
a
1
finger
head
tastes
were
different
but
not
in
a
positive
way
strange
sweetness
odd
aftertaste
not
a
great
offering
by
usually
reliable
anchor
o
as
always
a
solid
holiday
winter
warmer
beer
that
always
seems
to
include
a
number
of
flavorsaromas
that
i
associate
with
the
season
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
with
well
hidden
alcohol
but
as
with
almost
all
of
the
examples
of
the
style
not
a
real
sessionable
beer
overall
drinkability
this
is
a
weird
one
for
a
winter
warmer
i
swear
at
times
the
overall
effect
of
this
beer
in
taste
is
that
it
reminds
me
of
hp
sauce
but
not
as
tangy
its
not
a
sweet
beer
and
its
definitely
unique
but
im
not
sure
if
i
like
like
it
im
not
against
it
but
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
in
light
of
previous
versions
of
this
beer
an
easy
drinking
ode
to
the
holiday
season
i
taste
christmas
and
new
years
wrapped
into
one
serving
tasty
and
with
a
seasional
felling
perfect
with
the
fat
christmass
food
or
just
for
a
sip
right
with
the
fireplace
i
cant
give
details
on
these
anchor
releases
anymore
as
it
is
too
hard
to
compare
to
notes
from
previous
years
suffice
to
say
that
it
seems
to
be
easier
drinking
this
year
but
not
very
complex
or
memorable
lots
of
nice
spices
over
a
simplistic
porter
base
o
4
75
one
of
the
best
osas
in
years
its
been
over
a
decade
i
think
since
i
was
wowed
by
one
this
one
is
very
good
last
years
was
on
the
shelves
for
months
i
bet
this
one
will
disappear
very
quickly
o
an
enjoyable
change
in
the
recipe
this
year
definitely
still
fits
the
season
well
and
does
a
good
job
at
balancing
the
sweetness
and
spices
nice
and
easy
to
drink
while
remaining
a
good
fireside
sipper
classic
yet
new
and
fined
as
usual
overall
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
and
one
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
during
christmas
the
beer
has
all
you
would
expect
from
the
season
from
the
cherry
logo
and
the
spices
associated
with
gingerbread
men
the
flavors
does
not
exacty
make
this
a
beer
you
want
to
session
but
it
is
pretty
nice
to
have
with
company
to
celebrate
the
season
i
do
wish
the
anchor
brewers
would
be
bolder
with
the
spices
its
time
to
be
creative
poured
into
an
euler
stange
pours
a
deep
red
amber
with
a
half
finger
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
cinnamon
nutmeg
hints
of
dark
dried
fruit
flavor
is
mild
caramel
malt
the
same
holiday
spices
as
the
aroma
mild
dark
dried
fruit
mildly
earthy
with
a
hint
of
pine
a
somewhat
less
piney
than
past
versions
i
remember
and
now
kind
of
old
fashioned
but
i
look
forward
to
this
every
year
one
of
my
early
craft
beers
from
at
least
30
years
ago
and
one
ive
had
almost
every
holiday
a
nice
mellow
holiday
ale
full
bodied
nose
yet
a
lighter
bodied
taste
a
solid
offering
i
know
that
anchor
does
good
things
especially
with
this
holiday
seasonal
ale
but
i
just
cant
get
on
board
the
herbal
yeasty
underpinning
keeps
me
from
appreciating
everything
else
going
on
here
alas
not
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
so
surpassed
by
its
upstart
colleagues
now
its
kind
of
sad
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
smells
like
allspice
nutmeg
and
a
little
cinnamon
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
subdued
than
the
smell
some
toffee
and
allspice
a
little
more
mild
in
mouthfeel
than
i
would
like
the
warm
toasted
malt
character
is
always
what
i
love
about
this
beer
the
spice
is
subtle
and
well
integrated
one
of
my
favorites
every
year
and
this
is
no
different
if
you
have
always
been
a
fan
of
this
release
dont
let
the
detractors
sway
you
i
treat
this
as
an
end
of
the
night
beer
i
work
the
311
shift
and
like
to
have
one
drink
when
i
get
home
it
has
a
unique
flavor
i
cant
quite
identify
but
i
will
still
pick
another
6
pack
up
tomorrow
this
one
just
is
not
doing
it
for
me
its
always
fun
to
see
how
the
recipe
is
changed
yeartoyear
but
this
year
is
sort
of
a
bust
excellent
i
always
make
an
effort
to
try
anchors
special
brews
unfortunately
this
one
let
me
down
a
bit
really
not
much
flavor
and
what
is
present
is
watered
down
tastes
of
soil
a
bit
musty
excited
to
try
this
years
as
i
always
look
forward
to
the
new
release
dark
toffee
and
dried
fruit
mediumthin
mouthfeel
with
a
little
herbal
character
what
is
going
on
with
the
fnishaftertaste
wet
musty
soil
seriously
something
unpleasant
started
off
familiar
but
i
reluctantly
finished
the
bottle
will
try
again
to
rereview
but
disappointed
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
from
the
can
with
a
foamy
mocha
head
smells
of
cocoa
and
roasted
malts
but
the
aromas
subdued
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
is
more
predominant
in
the
taste
along
with
toffee
raisins
and
dark
cherries
medium
mouth
with
some
carbonation
not
much
spice
for
a
winter
warmer
but
its
a
very
nice
beer
somewhere
between
a
strong
ale
and
a
porter
not
the
best
winter
beer
stir
crazy
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
raisins
the
taste
has
big
and
heavy
lots
of
vanilla
sweet
fruit
with
hints
of
chocolate
nice
big
body
and
feel
overall
its
a
fantastic
beer
and
a
top
winter
warmer
overall
might
give
this
a
try
on
tap
at
a
later
point
just
to
make
sure
but
it
seems
like
this
one
and
i
are
just
not
meant
to
be
together
good
head
tap
beer
at
celts
in
rosemount
o
a
unique
take
on
a
winter
warmer
not
the
caramel
overload
other
beers
in
the
style
can
be
the
mix
of
flavors
is
unique
and
rewarding
worth
checking
out
i
noticed
a
slight
smell
of
roasted
nuts
and
cocoa
beans
this
is
a
malty
rather
than
hoppy
beer
however
it
does
not
have
the
creamy
flavor
of
other
malty
beers
such
as
guinness
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
figs
raisins
or
some
other
similar
dried
fruit
very
good
flavor
chocolate
at
first
then
brown
sugar
and
raisins
pours
very
very
dark
ruby
red
two
fingers
of
tan
creamy
head
that
dissipates
slowly
with
nice
clinging
sweet
aroma
with
fruit
some
malt
overtones
roasty
and
chocolate
moderate
mouth
feel
not
thin
but
not
thick
either
but
satisfying
smokey
malty
taste
the
fruit
taste
is
subtle
and
controlled
sweetness
is
evident
but
not
overpowering
in
the
beginning
but
becomes
a
bit
cloying
by
the
end
very
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
i
dont
generally
go
for
fruit
beers
but
this
one
is
nicely
balanced
all
of
the
extra
ingredients
cacao
vanilla
raisins
brown
sugar
add
subtle
and
very
pleasant
taste
this
is
a
good
tasting
ale
even
though
as
it
warms
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
too
much
for
me
ymmv
can
poured
a
dark
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
offwhite
head
with
limited
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
dry
raisin
and
brown
sugar
with
a
healthy
dose
of
caramelized
sugar
is
very
interesting
taste
is
also
dominated
by
a
healthy
dose
of
caramelized
malt
with
some
dry
raisins
notes
and
some
light
residual
brown
sugar
notes
body
is
bit
light
to
sustain
all
the
spices
and
dry
fruits
notes
with
medium
carbonation
interesting
beer
but
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
bit
malt
profile
overall
this
complex
winter
ale
is
unusual
and
satisfying
a
little
more
body
for
a
fuller
mouthfeel
would
be
a
plus
or
just
drive
a
little
more
gravity
from
base
malt
and
get
more
warmth
and
body
but
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
and
its
unusual
character
and
wonderful
balance
make
this
an
awesome
beer
good
beer
would
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
interesting
blend
of
a
lot
of
flavors
really
lacks
in
the
body
department
though
very
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
sort
of
modeling
itself
on
a
belgian
quad
at
least
in
terms
of
malt
bill
and
flavor
notes
but
drinking
a
whole
lot
easier
the
can
says
brown
sugar
but
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
that
after
the
head
has
settled
well
enough
for
me
to
take
a
big
whiff
i
get
the
vanilla
and
i
really
get
the
raisins
apparently
pureed
or
something
before
added
to
the
kettle
all
the
sugar
that
should
be
here
is
fermented
out
this
is
not
at
all
sweet
for
what
it
is
a
testament
to
the
yeast
which
has
cleaned
the
beer
up
nicely
without
imparting
a
ton
of
flavor
balance
with
the
additives
in
taste
but
the
vanilla
is
the
strongest
fuller
bodied
but
honestly
just
a
bit
light
for
the
style
like
that
we
have
a
winter
warmer
here
without
all
the
usual
spice
accompaniment
i
would
buy
this
great
use
of
raisins
too
good
seasonal
pours
out
dark
as
night
with
a
tiny
brown
head
that
dissipated
right
away
smell
is
of
raisins
and
other
dark
fruit
i
really
dont
get
much
else
from
the
nose
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
really
i
only
get
dark
fruits
maybe
a
little
brown
sugar
really
just
not
that
much
going
on
but
it
is
pretty
tasty
but
nothing
special
to
be
sure
mouthfeel
is
ironically
slightly
thick
even
though
it
seems
not
very
carbonated
just
not
a
very
complex
beer
in
my
opinion
it
tastes
ok
and
i
wouldnt
not
drink
it
but
its
not
anything
that
i
would
buy
again
edit
had
another
six
pack
and
had
to
bump
it
up
lot
of
nice
flavors
here
packed
into
a
6
5
beer
for
me
this
is
indeeds
most
drinkable
beer
yet
i
simply
cant
stop
at
one
too
many
competing
flavors
for
me
i
am
sure
many
will
like
the
cocoa
and
vanilla
mix
o
other
than
the
somewhat
weak
mouthfeel
i
really
liked
this
one
good
complex
flavors
and
a
good
winter
beer
pours
a
dark
ruddy
brown
with
a
trace
tan
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
figs
chocolate
dried
cherry
caramel
i
can
taste
the
chocolate
nibs
figs
or
possibly
raisins
dark
dried
fruit
caramel
body
is
medium
light
carbonation
is
a
bit
weak
overall
the
miscellaneous
flavors
arent
working
for
me
overall
supporting
this
local
and
12oz
cans
its
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
but
doesnt
really
make
a
clear
statement
not
a
stout
with
strong

and
not
amped
up
spicy
winter
beer
just
in
the
middle
between
those
decent
enough
but
not
really
to
my
tastes
o
this
has
been
my
least
favorite
indeed
all
their
other
stuff
is
much
better
to
be
honest
i
think
it
is
just
way
too
convoluted
and
overengineered
the
can
reads
like
a
cake
recipe
cacao
nibs
vanilla
raisins
brown
sugar
and
natural
flavors
whatever
those
may
be
i
dont
think
they
needed
to
add
all
those
extras
each
one
on
its
own
or
with
one
more
ingredient
might
have
led
to
more
complimentary
flavors
but
the
kitchen
sink
approach
didnt
result
in
a
successful
beer
for
me
overall
a
very
good
spin
on
a
winter
beer
its
more
like
a
twist
on
a
milksweet
stout
than
the
typical
winter
warmer
good
creamy
chocolate
taste
with
a
nice
dark
fruit
undertone
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
has
a
cocoa
nib
and
dark
fruit
aftertaste
a
pretty
good
beer
but
im
not
sure
if
all
of
the
flavors
compliment
each
other
real
well
glad
i
at
least
picked
up
a
single
can
to
try
this
less
nibs
please
a
great
take
on
a
winter
warmer
this
would
make
a
great
thanksgivingchristmas
beer
very
holiday
like
in
flavor
and
easy
drinking
too
ill
say
it
again
nice
work
love
to
see
it
canned
though
maybe
next
year
o
good
winter
seasonal
really
impressed
with
the
indeed
beers
that
i
found
in
mn
heck
of
a
beer
just
really
balanced
with
lots
going
on
in
a
compact
package
roasty
spiced
smooth
and
delicious

for

canning
much
more
chocolate
in
the
aroma
and
taste
maybe
a
little
more
chocolate
than
i
would
prefer
which
begins
to
bother
me
about
halfway
through
the
can
the
addition
of
vanilla
is
more
subtle
in
the
aroma
but
provides
a
nice
extra
finish
to
the
beer
that
i
like
i
liked
it
better
before

my

dropped
from

to

the

will
garner
the

this
is
a
very
well

and
smooth
winter

possibly

with

an

definitely

ample

content
feel
of

that
holds

overall
a
good
ale
to
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
im
not
exactly
sure
what
is
overly
wintery
about
this
beer
but
i
did
enjoy
it
and
think
it
would
taste
great
paired
with
a
warm
winter
meal
overall
for
about
four
bucks
this
beer
was
a
blessing
when
i
go
back
i
will
pick
up
two
more
while
the

up

almost

dark

with

that
settles
to
a

on

of
the

foamy
streaks
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining

on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted

caramel
and
some
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
candied
dark
fruit
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
overall
really
fits
the
bill
a
perfect
winter
beer
roasted
and
warming
not
too
sweet
to
be
had
in
a
mountain
chalet
surrounded
by
snow
this
is
a
beer
that
i
very
much
believes
needs
to
be
paired
with
food
spicy
chilli
smoked
fish
bbq
with
plenty
of
greens
korma
and
shepherds
pie
all
come
to
mind
as
great
companions
mild
aroma
of
roasted
malts
with
coffee
tones
the
flavour
follows
suit
with
a
more
robust
malt
spectrum
roasted
and
toasted
malt
sweetness
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
well
balanced
with
a
sweet
finish
and
the
6
5
abv
is
completely
hidden
none
of
the
spice
elements
that
are
common
in
north
american
winter
warmers
but
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
pours
dark
to
almost
black
with
ruby
around
the
edges
light
does
not
pass
through
it
i
did
not
have
the
head
retention
that
was
listed
previously
probably
due
to
being
from
bottle
as
opposed
from
tap
surprisingly
sweet
up
front
with
powerful
malt
on
the
back
a
classic
winter
warmer
style
this
whole
beer
rings
of
old
school
the
nose
has
sweet
almost
bubblegum
notes
similiar
to
a
wheat
beer
the
body
is
all
ale
though
i
havent
had
too
many
of
this
brewerys
beers
but
this
is
definitely
one
to
remember
and
try
next
holiday
season
one
or
two
or
a
snowy
night
would
be
very
pleasant
o
expecting
a
very
spicy
warm
ale
surprised
to
get
this
big
bold
malty
treat
but
a
little
reading
tells
me
that
this
is
common
in
the
english
style
very
chocolate
stout
in
my
opinion
very
tasty
notes
for
all
the
world
this
reminds
me
of
a
bsda
this
is
dark
slightly
sweet
slightly
smoky
and
very
delicicious
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
one
again
o
this
thing
is
awesome
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
it
truly
is
remarkable
ive
never
had
a
winter
warmer
this
full
bodied
complex
and
creamy
smells
and
drinks
more
like
a
stout
than
anything
very
drinkable
yet
satisfying
winter
warmer
the
aroma
taste
and
aftertaste
are
all
very
similar
but
every
sip
seems
to
be
a
different
mix
of
chocolate
coffee
and
fruit
i
dont
know
if
i
will
revisit
this
beer
style
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
a
tasty
winter
warmer
doesnt
overload
the
palette
with
spices
yet
doesnt
come
across
too
mild
an
easy
drinking
ale
that
boasts
a
solid
flavour
profile
and
a
uniqueness
that
comes
with
the
style
o
a
spectacular
winter
warmer
that
i
will
hit
annually

grade

a
very
english
winter
warmer
that
happens
to
nail
down
everything
i
personally
like
about
the
style
st
peters
winter
ale
is
one
of
those
rare
beers
that
retains
everything
that
characterises
a
style
but
adds
distinctive
changes
that
complement
the
styles
characteristics
to
produce
something
uniquely
delicious
well
worth
seeking
out
d
a
really
nice
winter
ale
subtle
but
not
too
cute
od
seemed
sahtiish
not
bad
not
overly
tasty

couldnt

into
it

showing
up

right
now
m
medium

silky
light

this
holds
up
very
nicely
in
the
bottle
i
wish
i
could
have
this
on
cask
i
am
sure
that
would
be
a
great
treat
still
as
is
something
i
would
highly
recommend
and
something
i
am
sure
to
buy
more
of
before
the
season
is
over
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
but
doesnt
provide
a
rich
malty
flavor
or
alcohol
warming
like
other
beers
in
the
style
it
tastes
more
similar
to
a
porter
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
reminds
me
of
the
british
family
of
beers
for
sure
its
a
good
one
drinkability
found
this
to
be
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
good
try
wouldnt
seek
again
as
their
are
better
beers
out
there
in
this
category
poured
a
dark
burgundy
bordering
on
black
a
finger
of
tan

fades
to
some
big
bubbles
and
retains
a
collar
of
head
with
minimal
lace
nose
of
dark
fruits
milk
chocolate
plum
figs
bit
of
roastiness
and
some
warm
winter
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
which
arent
prominent
but
are
interwoven
amongst
the
others
taste
has
more
of
the
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
battling
for
supremacy
on
the
palate
with
some
roastiness
in
there
for
good
measure
good
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
quick
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
solid
drinkability
a
winner
im
guessing
this
is
more
like
a
porter

that
this

may
seem
harsh
but
if
you
have
not
tried
it

it
somewhere
feel
free
to
pick
it
up
you
may
be

variety
slight

not
complex
enough
to
carry
the

notes
didnt
impress
me
nothing
outstanding
the
spicy
malty
smell
was
the
best
part
i
much
preferred
the
peters
english
ale
the
taste
differs
from
the
nose
slightly
it
starts
out
with
a
fairly
strong
coffee
essence
then
followed
by
lots
of
chocolate
flavors
with
the
caramel
complimenting
that
profile
some
slight
herbal
bitterness
in
the
finish
from
either
the
dark
roasted
grains
or
some
light
uk
hops
full
malt
flavor
really
nice
sweetness
up
front
some
nearly
burnt
roast
that
leads
to
a
long
dry
finish
the
heavy

flavors
contrast
atypically
with
the
lighter
body
a
nice
example
of
the
winter
warmer
style
you
can
always
rely
upon
the
english
to
do
a
classy

correctly
st
peters
is
one
of
the
few
english
breweries
which
you
can
consistently
rely
on
to
deliver
an
authentic
quality
and
fresh
product
to
the
states
second
only
to
sam

extremely
drinkable
and
worth
the
purchase
if
located

is
some
light
roast
cocoa
caramel
a
hint
of
earth
taste
follow
suit
with
a
noticable
cherry
flavor
which
borders
on
syrupymedicinal
a
hint
of
anise
caramel
fruit
bread
plums
cocoa
roast
not
a
stout
but
some
of
the
characteristics
of
an
english
stout
its
quite
quaffable
a
little
thin
bodied
creamy
but
low
carb
decent
but
not
as
impressive
as
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
drink
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
and
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
it
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
scaled
down
version
unibroues
trois
pistols
worth
seeking
out
especially
during
the
colder
months
a
good
twist
on
the
more
spiceforward
winter
warmers
ive
had
possessing
a
lot
more
characteristics
of
an
english
stout
if
this
was
indeed
a
stout
i
could
think
of
several
stouts
that
id
purchase
before
this
one
but
i
like
it
as
a
unique
ww
this
style
has
yet
to
really
blow
me
away
but
keep
them
coming
for
the
season
this
ones
a
great
start
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
mild
roasted
malt
earthy
hops
caramel
and
and
chocolate
flavour
has
mild
bitterness
and
bigger
on
sweetness
smooth
mouthfeel
this
really
reminds
me
of
a
porter
a
nice
example
of
the
winter
warmer
style
you
can
always
rely
upon
the
english
to
do
a
classes
style
correctly
the
abv
for
this
beer
is
pretty
high
for
a
british
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
well
balanced
and
very
quaffable
lots
of
roasted
malt
with
peppery
spice
candy
sugar
and
dark
fruit
notes
hints
of
plum
raisin
fig
grape
and
dark
cherry
this
beer
is
fuller
bodied
than
expected
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
its
complexity
d
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
surprising
considering
the
relatively
low
abv
not
sure
from
whence
the
odd
sourness
comes
perhaps
its
because
im
flirting
with
the
best
before
date
maybe
its
just
the
style
at
any
rate
it
detracts
from
an
otherwise
pleasant
ale
it
is
true
winter
outdoors
0
c
and
five
inches
of
snow
on
the
ground
and
that
does
make
this
beer
feel
more
appropriate
based
on
this
tasting
i
cant
recommend
it
good
atmosphere
bold
intimidating
appearance
although
nothing
too
exciting
and
not
much
in
terms
of
a
head
or
lacing
nose
is
great
though
great
combination
of
deep
rich
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
hints
flavor
follows
suit
deep
rich
and
robust
and
a
clean
palette
with
a
good
balance
of
tones
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
this
was
quite
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
my
only
other
experience
with
winter
warmers
was
sam
smiths
winter
welcome
ale
while
this
is
a
whole
different
beast
its
a
delightful
porterish
brew
that
id
likely
reach
for
again
dpretty
drinkable
prob
wouldnt
drink
too
much
with
tastier
imo
winterwarmers
out
there
though
d
im
going
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
for
sure
very
enjoyable
to
drink
a
very
delicious
winter
beer
a
winter
warmer
that
is
too
dry
the
bitterness
is
too
raw
and
the
flavours
are
all
over
the
place
will
probably
gain
of
a
years
cellaring
this
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
winter
warmer
but
i
dont
care
it
tastes
great
id
recommend
trying
it
its
a
great
balance
of
flavor
and
drinkability
and
it
should
definitely
be
picked
up
at
least
once
d
pretty
easy
drinking
full
malt
flavor
really
nice
sweetness
up
front
some
nearly
burnt
roast
that
leads
to
a
long
dry
finish
the
heavy
malt
flavors
contrast
atypically
with
a
light
nearly
watery
body
soft
alcohol
hop
flavors
do
show
with
some
grass
and
earthy
qualities
smooth
although
not
rich
or
light
this
of
course
leads
to
easy
drinking
probably
dangerously
so
for
such
a
soft
drinker
it
is
very
complex
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
winter
warmer
st
peters
winter
ale
certainly
has
an
oddness
against
its
counterparts
i
will
say
that
much
but
strangely
it
works
and
im
happy
to
have
a
full
pint
of
it
i
cant
offer
any
food
pairings
but
might
i
suggest
an
armchair
by
a
fireplace
frosty
windows
and
the
company
of
fragrant
evergreen
this
is
definitely
a
guest
you
want
in
your
house
for
the
holidays
anyway
its
good
but
i
cant
help
thinking
theres
got
to
be
better
though
id
be
hardpressed
to
find
another
that
looks
this
good
i
like
this
one
alot
id
have
this
one
with
aged
cheddar
and
dried
figs
d
this
beer
is
very
quaftable
with
a
mellow
rich
dark
flavor
that
helps
melt
away
the
winter
a
surprising
treat
in
a
green
bottle
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
strange
but
this
is
a
solidly
middle
of
the
road
example
of
the
style
some
similarity
to
the
09
anchor
christmas
ale
when
fresh
a
decently
drinkable
ale
the
warming
side
of
things
hidden
at
best
and
the
herbal
drying
nature
of
this
brew
sure
suits
its
packaging
a
nice
beer
it
certainly
warmed
me
up
the
only
thing
that
let
me
down
was
the
nose
which
i
felt
was
a
bit
weak
all
in
all
a
very
satisfying
winter
warmer
theres
a
number
of
characteristics
of
the
brew
that
lead
me
to
place
it
more
in
the
brown
ale
or
porter
category
which
for
me
is
a
huge
plus
ive
got
another
one
in
the
fridge
which
suits
me
just
fine
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
medium
cabonation
this
is
a
prime
example
of
a
winter
warmer
and
one
of
the
most
drinkable
examples
ive
come
across
the
sweetness
is
in
check
and
the
spices
dont
run
wild
in
fact
its
so
similar
to
a
stout
i
probably
wouldnt
be
able
to
pick
it
out
of
a
lineup
highly
drinkable
and
recommended
the
taste
of
this
beer
also
surprized
me
as
it
drank
so
much
like
a
porter
hoppy
front
end
chocolate
notes
roasted
malts
and
a
long
finish
nicely
balanced
oatmeal
any
spices
were
subdued
i
agree
completely
with
what
the
label
states
this
is
a
beer
rich
in
flavour
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
nice
agreeable
texture
on
a
cold
winters
day
first
beer
from
this
brewery
there
are
others
available
at
the
lcbo
now
i
look
forward
to
trying
them
all
d
it
was
an
interesting
brew
but
i
didnt
quite
prefer
it
to
other
wws
guess
its
hard
to
judge
based
on
style
if
its
such
a
broad
range
d
smooth
and
good
flavored
i
enjoyed
this
ale
quite
a
bit
shared
with
a
friend
who
also
really
enjoyed
this
is
my
first
beer
from
st
peters
and
i
will
make
sure
to
try
others
from
the
1
pint
9
fl
oz
dark
olive
bottle
sampled
on
december
24
2009
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
about
a
quarter
inch
creamy
beige
head
there
is
a
kind
of
chocolate
scent
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
background
of
hops
it
feels
more
like
a
porter
on
first
whiff
the
taste
is
also
very
much
like
a
porter
with
a
light
balance
of
hops
and
chocolate
malts
this
is
tasty
future
outlook
4s
all
around
rock
solid
and
worthy
of
a
repeat
this
beer
is
similar
to
their
cream
stout
but
drier
coffee
is
a
little
bit
more
prominent
and
chocolate
less
so
if
you
were
to
give
this
to
me
blind
id
probably
think
this
stout
regardless
of
what
it
is
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
had
one
for
the
first
time
last
christmas
and
i
have
no
idea
why
i
didnt
pick
up
more
at
the
time
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
more
this
time
around
thsi
beer
pours
a
jet
black
colour
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
a
dense
creamy
two
finger
head
with
nice
lingering
lacing
everywherethe
aroma
is
very
typical
of
a
winter
warmer
with
aromas
of
dark
chocolatesweet
coffee
and
spicy
fruity
hopsit
has
a
nice
above
average
mouthfeel
with
a
big
hint
of
mocha
first
up
followed
by
some
earthyfruity
hops
but
no
bitterness
at
all
just
a
nice
earthy
sweetness
about
it
and
very
easy
to
drinkmy
only
comnplaint
being
is
that
we
dont
see
this
brew
in
our
winter
d
moderate
to
low
drinkability
for
a
winter
warmer
while
it
succeeds
at
warming
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
completely
in
the
vein
of
liquid
bread
quite
like
i
was
hoping
for
seems
more
like
a
porter
that
i
would
pair
more
with
food
than
a
time
of
year
um
overall
this
kind
of
just
tastes
like
a
variation
of
their
cream
stout
and
im
not
sure
what
is
suppose
to
be
especially
wintery
about
it
i
feel
like
im
missing
the
punchline
here
a
really
nice
winter
warmer
with
a
little
extra
mouthfeel
is
super
watery
and
light
with
really
not
too
much
going
on
for
a
winter
ale
taste
is
a
bit
smokey
and
malty
with
some
light
sweetness
its
ok
but
not
great
d
i
wish
i
got
more
as
this
is
an
easy
drink
for
me
nice
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
very
aggresively
to
get
a
medium
sized
tan
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
very
dark
almost
opaque
amber
with
brown
highlights
aroma
is
figs
dates
and
a
little
of
other
dark
ripe
fruit
dark
cocoa
and
hint
of
coffee
flavor
is
more
like
a
porter
decent
body
and
fine
carbonation
dont
pick
up
the
alcohol
much
a
slight
dry
bitter
finish
alcohol
at
the
very
end
quite
drinkable
this
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
beautiful
crimson
highlights
the
most
impressive
aspect
of
the
beer
is
really
the
aroma
it
hit
me
immediately
on
the
pour
very
dark
and
chocolate
roasted
characters
a
touch
of
coffee
but
mostly
dark
and
roasted
malts
grain
and
a
bit
of
a
gristlike
scent
low
hop
presence
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
a
bit
restrained
especially
given
the
smell
although
htere
is
some
dark
caramel
notes
and
a
full
malt
flavor
barley
the
beer
is
dry
and
at
times
a
little
oily
and
slick
theres
also
a
notable
husky
quality
that
occasionally
makes
an
appearance
medium
body
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
found
on
halfprice
closeout
at
priscos
grocery
on
prairie
in
aurora
il
pours
a
darker
brown
leaning
a
bit
toward
the
yellow
end
of
brown
with
a
normal
offwhite
head
that
retreats
into
a
thin
halo
served
at
cellar
temperature
it
blooms
with
caramel
and
light
roasted
malts
like
the
complexity
of
a
120
l
crystal
malt
and
dark
fruit
aromas
the
flavor
is
true
to
the
aroma
providing
a
rich
fullbodied
flavor
adding
complex
bready
and
dark
malt
presence
a
yeast
character
reminiscent
of
candied
fruit
and
preserves
barely
balanced
by
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
certainly
a
heavy
beer
which
is
appropriate
for
the
style
which
definitely
excludes
it
from
the
session
beer
club
certainly
one
to
seek
in
the
singlebottle
section
for
a
cold
winter
night
or
even
a
chilly
summer
night
after
a
cold
front
has
blown
through
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
dark
beer
thats
worth
drinking
for
a
while
but
there
are
other
beers
of
its
kind
that
i
would
choose
first
this
poured
an
opaque
mahogany
with
a
bit
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
earthy
barley
and
prune
and
mocha
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
tasted
like
sweet
chocolate
and
prune
and
barley
malt
and
bitter
coffee
with
a
hint
of
oak
it
was
fairly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
nice
flavor
and
good
body
in
typical
english
fashion
it
was
very
clean
and
understated
but
was
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
more
of
a
porter
than
a
winter
warmer
but
still
a
solid
beer
unfortunately
it
wasnt
distinct
enough
for
me
to
remember
to
try
again
this
has
a
malty
richness
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
keep
it
balanced
enough
and
spicy
enough
for
a
nice
winter
brew
this
is
a
fun
one
imo
a
solid
choice
for
a
winter
beer
that
is
more
drinkable
than
many
slowsipper
winter
offerings
but
is
warming
complex
but
approachable
a
nice
take
on
a
traditional
english
winter
warmer
drinkability
this
one
was
soso
great
looking
and
a
decent
smell
but
the
overly
charred
flavor
and
the
too
forward
oxidation
make
it
just
mediocre
i
truely
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
brews
ive
had
the
luxury
to
enjoy
i
strongly
urge
all
my
fellow
ba
brethren
to
partake
in
this
wonderful
brew
while
the
price
tag
may
be
stiff
the
results
are
worth
it
this
is
where
the
beer
falls
apart
no
carbonation
at
all
thin
mouthfeel
not
appealing
mediumbodied
with
gentle
carbonation
and
a
supple
mouthfeel
d
an
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
that
i
look
forward
to
in
the
cold
months
pours
avery
dark
red
almost
back
if
not
near
light
great
thick
tan
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
aroma
is
sweet
malt
toffeecaramel
taste
is
malt
toffe
and
caramelends
with
a
slight
hop
taste
very
smooth
will
warm
your
heart
and
soul
on
a
cold
winters
night
smooth
caramel
and
nutty
taste
not
overpowering
a
good
hearty
beer
finished
smooth
with
a
sweet
molasses
finish
definitely
recommended
i
need
to
check
this
one
out
again
havent
had
one
in
a
while
review
taken
from
notes
d
starts
off
as
a
nice
and
drinkable
traditional
winter
warmer
but
that
funk
at
the
end
killed
it
for
me
will
try
again
to
see
if
my
bottle
was
the
issue
d
this
beer
is
bold
in
taste
and
pleasant
enough
to
smell
but
its
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
liking
the
appearance
is
also
underwhelming
still
the
portersherrylike
character
and
subtle
fruitiness
work
well
enough
a
worthy
warmer
overall
d
id
love
to
have
a
couplefew
of
these
every
week
from
about
mid
december
to
late
march
too
bad
its
not
easy
for
me
to
get
drinkability
every
bottle
is
a
meal
not
too
heavy
but
there
is
plenty
of
warmth
and
flavor
to
keep
the
consumer
pleased
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
brew
mouthfeel
is
luxurious
fairly
low
carbonation
so
smooth
and
creamy
moderate
fullness
but
not
nearly
overwhelming
slight
warming
sensation
from
the
higher
alcohol
i
could
indulge
in
a
pint
or
two
of
this
without
being
too
weighed
down
a
good
sign
st
peters
winter
ale
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
smell
was
full
of
loads
of
sweet
malts
hints
of
milk
chocolate
the
taste
was
full
of
dark
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthfeel
was
good
with
nice
carbonation
drinkability
was
ok
a
bit
filling
overall
a
nice
beer
the
bittersweet
of
this
beer
made
it
a
very
interesting
beer
a
fairly
stern
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
interesting
and
worth
a
try
pours

solid

this
is
pretty
smooth
and
would
be
quite
drinkable
if
not
for
the
burnt
rubber
flavor
i
get
from
the
smokiness
a
very
interesting
winter
warmer

a

it
is

roasty
with

very
enjoyable
especially
on
a
stormy
night
this
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
coffee
stout
or
porter
goes
down
as
an
easy
but
intriguing
beer
well
worth
it
on
a
cold
night
great
warmer
even
though
the
abv
is
low
for
this
type
well
done
this
is
the
closest
beer
to
anchors
our
special
ale
maybe
they
share
more
than
a
few
ingredients
really
nice
but
i
want
a
bit
more
from
this
to
give
it
an
a
medium
bodied
smooth
drinkable
but
really
more
of
an
after
dinner
sipper
altogether
a
very
nice
cold
weather
brew
could
be
good
following
winter
activities

drinkability
an

maybe

is
a
better
word
taste
for
sure
we
think
they
released
this
a
couple
months
too
early
or
too
late
it
wasnt
quite
ready
yet
if
memory
serves
me
correctly
i
imagine
im
rating
this
the
best
of
the
st
peters
offerings
it
is
a
deceptive
beer
i
would
also
describe
it
as
being
very
english
in
style
and
flavor
think
samuel
smith
all
rounds
out
to
a
nice
long
finish
the
aroma
is
slightly
burnt
caramel
and
toasted
brown
bread
with
a
little
dark
chocolate
earth
and
a
light
fruity
wine
quality
it
has
unexpected
bitterness
adding
an
unusual
quality
for
the
other
elements
and
making
it
more
interesting
and
memorable
the
qualities
work
very
well
together
and
it
is
fullbodied
but
light
and
easy
to
drink
d
not
terribly
good
a
little
too
malty

sessioning

more
oily

flavour
is
very
full
and
immediately
hits
you
with

the
sweetness
then
gives
way
to
the
malts
and
spices
that
were
on
the
nose
very
full
mouthfeel
i
am
a
bit
sensitive
to
beers
that
are
sweet

this
one
uses
the
sweetness
well
pours
a
goodlooking
rubyedged
dark
brown
with
two
fingers
of

and
superb
lace
the
beer
smells
of
mediumtoasted
malt
and
sweet
caramel
with
an
herbal

counterpoint
the
flavor
is
very
similar
mellow
toasted
malts
and
carmel
with
light

balance

is
lighttomedium
crisp
and
clean
very
drinkable
but
doesnt
raise
itself
above
the
pack
very
dark

are
similar
with

licorice
and
that
slight
guinness
tang
sourness
nice
full
body
with
a
finish
right
back
where
i
started
this
is
the
best

expected

very
british
best
1

beer
that
i
have
ever
had
my
firstever
brew
from
st
peters
and
i
was
really
impressed
with
their
winter
ale
a

of
a
winter

this
a
superb
beer
and
an
awesome
representation
of
the

of
the
better

tasted
for

good

make
this
an
easily

that
fits
perfect
for

st
peters
did
really
well
with
this
one
excellent
sample
recommended
notes
this
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
sooo
smooth
the
best
brew
ive
had
from
this
company
a
first
class
winter
warmer
im
on
a
roll
right
now
with
top
notch
brews
hopefully
it
wont
stop
d
if
i
had
to
choose
a
winter
warmer
from
those
ive
tasted
id
probably
reach
for
this
less
of
that
funky
bitter
spice
i
dont
really
like
and
more
like
a
wellmade
english
brown
appears
a
somewhat
opaque
mahogany
brown
almost
black
hue
with
ruby
highlights
large
velvet
smooth
textured
beige
head
forms
thick
and
the

is
chunky
and
sporadically
spaced

are
full
of

tannins
upfront
cocoa
in
the

with
more
of

flowing
herbal

are
not

pronounced

meld

is

is

and
really
cask
like
in
a
sense
drinkability
a
welcome
addition
to
the
winter
ales
ive
come
across
so
far
this
season
unique
and
extremely
flavorful
compared
to
the
average
english
ale
d
a
very
drinkable
version
of
a
classic
english
winter
ale
dont
expect
much
spice
but
this
is
certainly
full
flavored
with
an
easy
drinkability
recommended
a
huge
roasted
malt
warmness
is
right
up
front
then
followed
by
a
tinge
of
fruitiness
im
thinking
berries
or
plums
its
either
somewhere
in
between
or
i
cant
decide
which
with
a
toffee
smoothness
in
the
middle
nice
medium
body
and
light
on
carbonation
though
this
is
not
as
strong
or
heavy
as
i
expected
its
far
from
being
thin
an
alcohol
pinch
shows
up
in
the
throat
but
the
balanced
complexities
of
the
malt
and
hops
intermingle
make
this
a
nice
glass
of
something
to
sip
on
such
cold
evenings
such
as
tonight
perfect
for
a
cold
winters
evening
winter
ale
doesnt
supplant
cream
stout
as
my
favorite
offering
from
these
guys
that
said
its
pretty
close
to
being
that
beers
equal
good
thing
theres
a
ready
supply
on
local
shelves
because
theres
no
doubt
that
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
beauty
will
be
consumed
before
winter
is
done
d
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
brew
has
a
good
taste
and
smooth
make
this
a
beer
thats
worth
drinking
sometime
yeah
this
is
one
kick
ass
winter
warmer
comes
in
silent
and
then
drops
this
complex
malt
bomb
on
the
palate
this
one
is
for
the
traditionalist
well
balanced
and
packed
with
flavour
definitely
a
winner
light
and
smooth
mouthfeel
for
a
strong
english
beer
finishes
fairly
dry
but
with
a
pleasant
lingering
caramel
sweetness
a
fine
ale
indeed

done
in
the
subtle
classy
way
that
all
st
peters
brews
are
warming
me
nicely
on
this
cold
wet
january
evening
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
im
going
to
have
to
stock
up
on
this
one
before
it
leaves
the
lcbo
a
very
drinkable
brew
indeed
lacks
some
spices
to
be
a
christmasbeer
but
its
a
very
good
stoutporterclone
goes
down
way
easily
give
it
a
go
a
fine
offering
with
a
balance
of
malt
alcohol
and
spiciness
the
malts
are
complex
but
difficult
to
put
a
handle
on
caught
somewhere
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
bock
in
flavor
but
with
a
lighter
body
expected
from
either
alcohols
keep
the
beer
thinned
but
compliment
with
a
sweet
powerful
dryness
hopped
for
mostly
balance
while
offering
a
hint
of
pine
and
grassy
notes
a
standard
brown
hue
with
near
clarity
any
other
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
or
allspice
remain
muted
and
compliment
the
esters
and
phenols
well
medium
maltiness
and
bitterness
that
linger
into
the
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
cocoa
coffee
and
spices
that
carry
into
the
next
sip
not
a
bad
offering
but
nothing
tangible
to
celebrate
either
there
is
a
fine
line
between
complex
and
hodgepodge
one
pint
9
oz
glass
bottle
color
of
deep
amber
with
a
medium
tan
colored
head
nose
of
roasted
malts
slight
coco
and
mild
hops

taste
of
roasted
malts
dark
roast
coffee
some
toffee
and
mild
hops
body
is
medium
and
round
and
with
medium
low
carbonation

aftertaste
of
sweet
malts
coffee
dry
and
lingering
pours
quite
dark
nearly
black
with
some
tinge
of
red
decent
head
at
first
that
fades
relatively
quickly
aromas
of
gingerbread
and
bitters
and
lots
of
bready
malt
taste
is
similar
not
sweet
at
all
in
fact
there
is
a
bitter
current
throughout
and
a
savory
spiciness
quite
bready
almost
crackery
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
though
there
is
some
alcohol
warmth
as
well
a
pleasure
d
a
fair
beer
from
st
peters
ive
had
better
beers
from
them
before
an
ok
offering
not
just
up
to
par
with
some
of
the
better
winter
beers
out
there
overall
why
the
hell
isnt
this
available
year
round
drop
the
winter
ale
thing
and
just
call
it
st
peters
dark
ale
this
is
their
best
offering
and
should
be
their
flagship
brew
really
like
the
mouthfeel
nice
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
but
it
goes
down
really
well
i
think
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
not
bad
stuff
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
for
its
high
price
it
could
be
better
mild
ale
needs
stronger
flavors
drinkability
seems
like
an
osa
type
flavor
pretty
good
with
flavors
all
over
the
place
not
sure
i
could
pound
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
day
though
more
of
a
once
a
season
treat
beer
i
did
like
it
though
the
flavor
is
rich
mad
malty
with
a
nice
toffee
flaovr
with
a
hint
of
caramel
some
burnt
dark
fruits
with
a
hint
of
smoke
with
a
slight
lingering
grassiness
decent
drinkability
but
the
burnt
bitterness
wears
on
you
somewhat
not
enough
to
significantly
detract
though
my
only
critique
is
that
this
beer
is
sort
of
loosely
constituted
that
is
to
say
that
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
gel
well
and
dont
work
as
a
cohesive
unit
well
worth
a
try
though
especially
since
its
a
pretty
cheap
one
and
done
beer
purchase
drinkability
i
cant
say
i
really
cared
for
it
i
just
wasnt
the
carnival
of
wintertime
smiles
i
was
hoping
for
notes
good
if
somewhat
unexceptional
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
often
but
its
good
for
the
season
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
id
weakly
counsel
you
to
avoid
this
beer
i
certainly
wouldnt
recommend
it
drinkability
quite
high
its
not
mindblowing
but
its
definitely
tasty
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
somewhat
roasted
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
nose
taste
is
smooth
roasty
and
very
nice
chocolate
hints
at
the
back
of
the
throat
and
only
a
slight
spiciness
goes
down
very
well
this
has
to
be
a
porter
or
milk
stout
of
sorts
very
roasty
smooth
and
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
d
very
drinkable
would
be
enjoyable
in
front
of
a
nice
warm
fireplace
i
dont
think
it
would
go
well
with
a
meal
but
thats
more
personal
preference
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
and
had
a
nice
thick
off
white
fluffy
head
to
it
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
it
tasted
of
roasted
malts
with
a
nice
slight
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
heavy
with
low
carbonation
overall
drinkability
was
decent
nice
to
drink
when
it
is
cold

like

with
a
nice
dose

in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
seasonal
that
i
would
not
mind
having
again
recommended
drinkability
i
had
to
ramp
up
the
drinkability
on
this
one
it
tastes
delicious
and
is
not
over
the
top
with
alcohol
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
all
in
one
sitting
ill
be
picking
up
another
of
these
before
the
season
is
over
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
is
not
present
and
the
brew
is
not
heavy
and
filling
a
decent

brew
worth
a
try

the

notes

through

is
a
touch
thin
for
a
stronger
ale
and
a
mild
warming
from
the
alcohol
follows
down
the
throat
on
the
swallow
a
decent
drinkable
winter
warmer
although
the
price
is
a
little
steep
pours
a
small
head
that
has
a
great
lacing
and
never
goes
away
the
color
is
black

hard
to
see
through

a
small

smooth

water
i
think
this
beer
isnt
very
complex
but
very
very
good
it
was
nice
to
have
this
one
time
but
for
the
price
it
wont
be
my
new
session
beer
d
not
too
strong
but
very
bitter
in
the
long
run
that
gets
more
annoying
as
you
go
still
a
decent
brew
from

st

a
deep
dark
brown
in

its
almost
black
with
a
ring
of
ruby
around
the
bottom
edge
of
the
glass
and
a
thick
bone
colored
head
poured
from
a
beautiful
green
half
liter
bottle
this
one
is
the
new
version
no
longer
flask
shaped
sweet
malt
is
evident
in
the
smell
numerous
flavors
wash
over
my
tongue
there
is
definitely
a
strong
vinous
nature
wood
oak
caramel
malt
perhaps
a
touch
of
spice
and
with
a
bitterness
toward
the
end
that
rounds
it
out
nicely
not
exactly
what
i
expected
but
rewarding
nonetheless
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
style

good
as
a

it
does
a
pretty
good
job
big
heavy
and
warming
but
no
more
than
one
a
night
of
these
for
me
surprisingly
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
smooth
and
quite
a
pleasure
to
drink
im
looking
forward
to
enjoying
a
few
more
of
these

the

pretty
nice

a
sweet
stout
kind
of
feel
to
it
not
to
much
carboration
which
makes
it
just
like
my
kind
of
beer
like
lighter
less
carborated
stout
kind
of
really
enjoyed
this
one
md
extremely
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
lightly
oily
and
lubricating
down
the
palate
this
winter
ale
is
so
flavoursome
and
vertical
in
terms
of
texture
i
couldnt
help
wondering
that
the
recipe
of
this
beer
is
somehow
connected
to
the
same
brewerys
creamy
stout
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
malty
winter
ale
pours
a
clear
but
very
dark
caramel
color
under
a
12
finger
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
to
collar
and
spots
of
film
but
still
manages
to
leave
a
few
strands
of
lace
the
nose
is
full
of
chestnuts
roasting
on
an
open
fire
the
mouth
is
mildly
carbonated

very
sticky
the
taste
is
excellent
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
nuts
to
start
followed
by
very
nice
dry
and
crisp
hops
leaving
a
slightly
espresso
bitter
on
the
palate
in
the
finish
the
bitterness
grows
into
the
aftertaste
still
very
dry
and
crisp
inviting
another

good
stuff
other
comments
a
decent
winter
ale
and
definitely
a
good
beer
allaround
nice

st
peter
winter
ale
probably
should
drink
this
in
winter
weather
but
oh
well
pours
a
red
almost
stained
mahogany
colour
does
let
a
bit
of
light
through
about
a
one
finger
head
that
lasts
lace
sticks
to
the
glass
rather
nice
to
look
at
big
malty
bread
smell
bit
of
ripe
fruits
some
spice
and
an
earthy
hop
smell
as
well
taste
is
as
close
to
liquid
bread
as
ive
ever
experienced
very
malty
almost
hearty
beer
some
fruits
and
berries
as
well
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
earthy
hops
warming
alcohol
after
each
swallow
almost
soothes
the
throat
pretty
much
a
meal
in
a
bottle
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
reminds
me
a
bit
of
pudding
drinkable
though
one
usually
satisfies
for
a
while
as
said
its
like
a
meal
in
a
bottle
a
nice
beer
with
good
taste
has
a
nice
sting
to
it
an
unusual
muddy
dark
rum
appearance
with
large
bubbles
ok
drink
and
hops
and
spicesburnt
toffee
sweetish
molasses
oily
coffee
but
kind
of
doesnt
work
all
together
a
typical
uk
beer
brought
in
by
lcbo
their
committee
of
13
preference
a
weak
porter
better
warmer
bottle
poured
a
dark
brownblack
ale
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
therefore
no
head
aroma
is
mostly
comprised
of
roasted
malt
taste
is
quite
simply
some
roasted
malt
with
some
bitterness
at
the
end
and
a
very
light
watery
finish
the
alcohol
doesnt
really
show
and
the
body
is
just
above
the
average
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
great
either
probably
an
improvement
over
some
other
beers
i
had
from
this
brewery
st
peters
ale
is
an
old
family
favourite
so
lets
try
the
winter
ale
shall
we
pours
a
wonderful
black
with
red
in
the
light
with
an
off
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
sheen
of
foam
and
ring
of
bubbles
aroma
is
a
dry
roasted
barley
smell
with
some
burnt
smells
taste
was
a
nice
dry
roasted
flavour
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
very
full
bodied
with
a
nice
coffeelike
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
very
little
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
i
have
always
wondered
why
the
style
is
called
winter
warmer
pours
black
with
cherry
glints
there
is
no
head
at
all
and
no
real
lace
it
looks
like
old
cask
ale
the
aroma
is
of
plums
ripe
cherries
some
kind
of
spice
and
some
fusel
alcohol
the
taste
is
unique
it
starts
out
with
a
smokey
roasty
maltiness
that
quickly
gives
way
to
some
medicinal
notes
and
spicey
alcohol
the
hops
are
present
in
their
bittering
potential
only
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
thick
in
fact
the
body
of
this
beer
is
reminiscent
of
motor
oil
this
is
a
very
good
winter
warmer
super
rich
thick
and
complex
aroma
of
roasted
malts
raisins
coffee
taste
was
superb
a
rich
complex
beer
full
of
burnt
coffee
smoke
caramel
licorice
and
molasses
alcohol
is
warming
mouthfeel
is
slick
moderately
carbonated
drinkability
is
alright
the
smokiness
is
a
bit
much
after
a
while
from
the
green
tinted
st
petes
12
liter
medicine
bottle
the
pour
was
enticing
revealed
a
stark
ruby
red
ale
with
a
1
finger
off
white
fluffy
cap
that
laces
well
moderate
corbonation
interesting
nose
musty
cinnamon
with
roasty
molasses
smells
has
a
nice
oily
mouthfeel
and
a
presence
like
a
spiced
porter
lovely
roastiness
combined
with
spices
and
burnt
toffee
sweetness
light
cocoa
tones
then
the
finish
is
drying
with
a
leafy
hop
astringency
mingling
with
a
nice
charred
toast
effect
and
a
slow
warming
a
very
nice
winter
ale
in
the
vein
of
a
spicey
warming
porter
recommended
very
deep
ruby
red
minimal
tan
head
low
carbonation
good
in
my
opinion
malty
spicy
aroma
malt
hops
caramel
sweetness
are
all
balanced
licorice
and
burnt
caramel
both
come
through
strongly
later
on
and
lingers
to
form
a
flavoursome
aftertaste
an
excellent
hearty
warming
winter
brew
that
does
exactly
what
its
designed
to
do
without
being
overly
strong
in
alcohol
highly
recommended
overall
this
beer
lacks
in
a
lot
of
aspects
but
it
just
good
enough
tasting
that
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
offered
one
that
being
said
i
definitly
would
never
seek
one
out
either
o
this
one
was
all
over
the
place
in
flavor
but
they
surprisingly
all
meshed
very
well
making
it
very
drinkable
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
and
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
than
one
bottle
o
this
beer
isnt
really
that
good
of
a
sipper
because
its
lighter
in
body
compared
to
others
in
the
style
and
doesnt
provide
alcohol
warming
on
the
other
hand
its
rather
easy
to
drink
if
you
are
looking
for
something
that
is
fruity
and
malty
i
expected
way
worse
so
i
come
away
with
a
decent
sixpack
that
im
going
to
drink
quickly
before
i
lose
that
march
holiday
spirit
im
assuming
the
purchaser
didnt
pay
much
for
the
pleasure
which
makes
this
all
the
more
recommedable
personally
i
could
go
either
way
i
dont
need
to
have
this
again
but
would
enjoy
it
next
year
if
it
comes
cheap
especially
as
cheap
as
this
happy
holidaysfirst

dundee
festive
ale
is
a
very
clear
sparkling
amber
ale
with
a
huge
pillowy
off
white
head
it
leaves
a
bunch
of
festive
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
just
a
very
slight
whiff
of
soft
malt
and
medicinal
herbs
the
soft
creamy
medium
body
has
a
dry
slightly
silty
finish
theres
some
fruity
malt
thats
a
touch
sweet
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
everythings
pretty
subdued
it
almost
seems
a
little
salty
that
reminds
me
of
genny
bock
its
not
really
exciting
but
it
goes
down
just
fine
d
not
special
but
certainly
very
good
for
the
price
point
drinkable
enough
a
nice
balance
of
malts
spice
and
hops
sort
of
a
richly
malty
and
spiced
esb
another
solid
and
reasonable
offering
from
one
of
the
lesser
celebrated
gateway
breweries
overall
i
love
dundee
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
better
than
others
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
goes
down
nicely
overall
a
good
brew
better
than
expected
and
this
is
nice
on
a
cold
winter
evening
i
agree
with
those
who
dont
find
much
holiday
spice
in
either
the
smell
or
the
taste
for
me
this
beer
had
characteristics
more
in
line
with
an
octoberfest
style
than
a
winter
warmer
my
review
scores
reflect
how
i
feel
it
fits
as
a
winter
warmer
o
this
was
okay
i
definitely
liked
the
weyerbacher
more
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
caramel
and
toffee
malt
i
dont
get
any
holiday
spices
or
other
aromas
that
i
typically
attribute
to
winter
warmers
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
nutmeg
mixed
in
the
beer
is
very
lightly
spiced
but
the
spices
are
present
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
not
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
winter
warmer
light
pours
a
copper
color
light
copper
maybe
moderate
head
with
decent
retention
allspice
in
the
nose
other
spices
clearly
found
on
palate
especially
cinnamon
light
caramel
flavors
incredibly
light
bodied
and
watery
could
have
tricked
me
into
thinking
this
is
a
bmc
product
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
you
would
be
good
to
go
is
great
straight
to
the
finish
drinkability
not
a
bad
tasting
ale
but
at
the
same
time
a
little
bland
itd
be
nice
if
more
of
the
flavors
on
the
label
popped
out
at
me
so
not
very
complextasting
but
not
bad
tasting
either
lots
of
balance
here
and
no
overwhelming
complexities
or
overspicing
to
kill
drink
ablilty
meaning
you
could
have
more
than
one
and
not
feel
the
need
to
move
on
d
well
its
good
but
no
really
something
i
could
see
as
a
go
to
winter
warmer
its
pretty
decent
and
well
deserved
of
at
least
a
b
rating
but
to
me
seems
to
need
more
spice
12
oz
bottle
ale
brewed
with
spices
an
interesting
herbal
aroma
spiced
with
some
caramel
malts
coming
through
pours
a
deep
mahogany
hue
that
is
clear
with
a
minimal
bone
colored
head
taste
is
alright
nothing
special
with
the
spice
notes
coming
through
on
the
front
of
the
taste
then
mellowing
into
caramel
and
bananas
overall
its
decent
nothing
great
by
any
means
but
very
drinkable
d
pretty
drinkable
flavor
is
a
little
reserved
and
flat
despite
the
tasting
credit
i
gave
the
brew
above
a
good
brew
nonetheless
this
beer
did
just
fine
on
this
snowy
winter
eve
happy
holidays
drinkable
indeed
the
6
2
is
a
nice
touch
as
i
like
my
winter
brews
kicked
up
abit
i
say
about
this
beer
what
ill
say
about
all
of
dundees
beers
if
you
want
to
teach
someone
about
beer
by
some
dundee
styles
and
train
them
on
what
are
simple
examples
of
the
various
styles
i
think
they
empty
the
brewerys
spice
rack
with
this
one
as
the
flavor
profile
is
all
over
the
place
it
is
an
interesting
treat
for
those
long
winter
nights
banana
seemed
a
bit
out
of
place
in
a
winter
warmer
out
of
a
bottle
this
winter
warmer
was
a
hazy
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
tan
head
that
had
some
reddish
highlights
to
it
as
i
consumed
the
beer
the
head
retained
itself
at
first
but
eventually
disappeared
entirely
however
the
lacing
was
in
sliding
patches
while
it
lasted
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
rye
spices
dark
fruit
some
alcohol
wood
and
a
little
must
the
flavors
were
similar
starting
with
the
caramel
malt
note
in
then
went
into
the
more
woody
elements
accentuated
by
the
spices
followed
by
the
bitterness
of
a
slightlyoverthehill
beer
admittedly
though
well
cared
for
this
brew
four
months
ago
would
have
been
better
it
was
malty
at
first
then
dry
and
earthy
and
that
was
about
it
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
average
and
the
carbonation
fine
d
i
didnt
like
this
one
i
got
this
beer
in
a
winter
brews
sampler
pack
on
clearance
i
have
never
seen
this
companys
beer
other
than
this
one
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
be
interested
in
another
this
is
more
complex
than
i
first
gave
credit
as
with
all
my
surprise
beers
id
love
to
try
this
in
a
blindfolded
flight
with
similar
offerings
i
suspect
that
this
beer
would
do
better
than
the
average
kind
of
thought
this
would
of
been
better
i
usually
like
dundee
beers
so
i
gave
this
a
try
poured
out
a
nice
dark
amber
with
good
head
a
sweet
caramel
is
all
i
could
really
get
out
of
the
smell
as
well
as
the
taste
aftertase
for
me
was
pretty
alcoholic
not
the
spicy
lively
festive
ale
i
was
expecting
a
good
beer
nonetheless
taste
still
has
plenty
of
sweet
spices
with
a
burnt
caramel
maltiness
some
blackened
toast
comes
in
at
the
end
and
it
seems
like
most
of
the
hop
presence
has
left
this
beer
some
time
ago
finishes
spiceladen
and
wet
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
and
there
is
a
bit
too
much
of
a
burnt
spice
flavor
for
my
liking
still
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
there
is
surprisingly
not
a
whole
lot
of
oxidized
malt
in
here
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
citrus
taste
is
good
malts
spices
and
citrus
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
fine
quality
brew
pretty
drinkable
but
nothing
to
gawk
over
as
far
as
winter
warmers
go
still
for
the
low
price
of
5
99
a
sixpack
its
hard
to
argue
with
this
beer
as
it
provides
almost
unrivaled
bangforyourbuck
value
poured
into
a
pint
glass
beer
was
a
medium
brown
in
color
with
a
small
head
and
very
light
lacing
smell
was
rather
weak
from
what
i
was
expecting
with
only
a
hint
of
caramel
and
nutmeg
taste
wasnt
bad
but
not
as
pronounced
in
the
spice
dept
as
advertised
this
seemed
a
little
weak
and
maybe
a
bit
flat
to
me
dry
finish
with
a
little
lingering
nutmeg
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
light
with
low
carb
bite
drinkability
was
not
a
problem
for
me
with
the
6
2
abv
barely
noticeable
not
bad
overall
but
pretty
much
a
hohum
beer
in
my
eyes
i
picked
up
a
six
tonite
on
a
whim
for
4
99
so
what
the
heck
i
dont
see
myself
beating
a
path
to
the
store
for
more
but
not
bad
for
dundee
buying
this
from
the
local
martins
grocery
store
probably
didnt
help
this
beer
any
what
with
the
way
they
store
and
display
their
offerings
drinkability
not
one
ill
be
revisiting
for
me
it
comes
up
as
far
too
thin
and
lacking
for
a
wintertime
ale
or
even
for
a
beer
with
the
word
festive
in
the
title
a
12
ounce
bottle
thanks
to
brothercannon
for
this
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
about
a
quarterinch
of
off
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
toasted
grains
bread
mild
notes
of
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
and
citrus
mainly
orange
light
caramel
sweetness
a
bit
of
spiciness
on
the
tongue
candied
apples
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
lightly
spiced
and
uncomplicated
thanks
again
tim
i
have
had
the
dundee
products
before
and
felt
that
they
have
done
well
with
a
few
of
their
offerings
so
i
saw
this
at
my
local
beer
store
they
where
just
unloading
cases
of
it
at
2
99
a
6
pack
or
10
for
a
case
decided
to
just
get
a
6
pack
and
give
it
a
try
as
some
of
the
holiday
beers
i
feel
are
over
spiced
this
one
poured
to
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
head
that
while
being
off
white
seemed
to
have
some
of
the
amber
color
in
it
the
aroma
was
fair
to
say
the
least
the
spice
was
there
but
was
not
over
the
top
and
there
was
a
nice
malt
presence
that
seemed
to
give
a
slight
nutty
caramel
like
scent
the
spice
was
nutmeg
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
the
flavors
where
also
quite
good
spice
was
there
but
again
not
over
the
top
the
flavors
give
a
slight
impression
of
a
brown
ale
which
seems
to
be
a
great
base
caramel
with
a
slight
chocolate
taste
cinnamon
is
tame
which
is
a
good
thing
while
i
think
the
nutmeg
stands
out
a
bit
overall
a
pretty
easy
drinking
brew
in
hind
site
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
the
case
as
the
beer
is
pretty
good
especially
for
the
price
overall
the
best
dundee
offering
i
have
had
yet
i
am
mildly
impressed
about
a
finger
of
rich
beige
head
sits
atop
a
dark
amber
brew
ive
got
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
bubbling
up
from
my
sa
pint
glass
burnt
brown
sugar
aroma
with
hints
of
spices
nutmeg
is
most
dominant
for
me
caramel
and
oranges
malty
on
the
front
and
the
spices
are
pretty
tame
but
they
do
seem
to
build
allspice
is
the
most
notable
on
the
palette
this
is
the
best
dundee
offering
ive
had
but
id
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
taste
i
think
the
cinnamon
might
be
a
little
overdone
pretty
good
winter
warmer
but
perhaps
a
little
over
spiced
p
s
and
now
for
the
airing
of
grievances
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
but
much
better
offerings
on
the
market
a
drinkable
winter
warmer
no
frills
and
no
surprises
let
this
one
get
to
optimum
temperature
for
best
results
pours
a
copper
color
with
1
finger
of
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
covering
with
some
chunky
lacing
the
nose
is
dominated
by
a
roasted
malt
aroma
with
some
hints
of
sweetness
and
fruit
has
a
nice
malty
taste
with
quite
a
bit
of
crispness
from
the
carbonation
that
keeps
it
lively
on
the
tongue
just
a
hint
of
some
spice
mostly
the
nutmeg
before
finishing
with
a
slightly
bitter
lingering
somewhat
plastic
taste
body
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
despite
a
somewhat
funky
finish
not
a
bad
beer
d
this
brew
is
nothing
special
but
its
decent
its
a
simple
run
of
the
mill
christmas
seasonal
not
bad
at
all
easy
to
drink
and
it
shows
that
high
falls
can
produce
beers
that
even
though
they
may
not
take
home
awards
are
still
quite
drinkable
perhaps
it
is
because
i
obtained
a
very
fresh
sample
but
it
seems
that
this
years
dundee
festive
ale
is
the
best
one
produced
i
am
going
to
pour
one
of
these
tonight
on
st
nikolas
eve
cheers
this
beer
isnt
really
all
that
bad
but
its
not
all
that
great
overall
rather
lightbodied
and
unbalanced
with
an
astringentacidic
finish
flavor
is
lighter
than
expected
and
a
bit
watery
in
nature
lightly
malty
up
front
and
with
the
spices
dominating
the
close
and
becoming
rather
dry
on
the
finish
feel
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
dry
chalkiness
of
the
spices
limit
drinkability
for
me
almost
as
if
the
spices
were
added
after
the
fact
given
the
lack
of
complexities
on
the
nose
this
is
a
pretty
solid
winter
warmer
smells
a
little
overspiced
but
mellows
out
a
little
in
the
taste
some
nice
cinnamon
notes
and
a
strong
malty
backbone
not
much
of
a
hops
presence
but
thats
to
be
expected
with
a
bit
of
a
tune
up
this
could
be
something
special
it
has
a
sweet
and
spicy
aroma
that
has
a
little
bit
of
musk
to
it
it
has
a
nice
head
at
first
that
disappears
quickly
with
some
staying
power
it
is
sort
of
offwhite
it
had
a
variety
of
different
sized
bubbles
which
i
found
to
be
unique
it
has
a
redbrown
body
but
mainly
red
it
little
bit
of
carbonation
to
the
body
it
has
a
spicy
flavor
you
can
definitely
taste
the
nutmeg
and
the
cinnamon
the
spices
are
proportioned
well
and
are
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
drinkability
not
atrocious
just
not
very
enticing
dundee
festive
ale
is
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
that
colors
well
within
the
lines
of
the
style
its
spiciness
shouldnt
offend
too
many
people
and
im
sure
that
its
price
is
on
the
friendly
side
as
well
bottom
line
not
bad
if
you
arent
expecting
fireworks
very
rich
mouthfeel
with
some
peppery
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
the
problem
is
very
easy
the
beer
just
doesnt
taste
all
that
great
obviously
thats
a
problem
if
youre
the
one
drinking
it
d
good
to
try
but
not
the
best
out
there
recommend
trying
it
at
a
bar
before
getting
the
six
pack
d
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
from
high
falls
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
winter
warmer
thats
enjoyable
this
beer
has
a
lot
goin
for
it
good
flavors
worth
a
try
especially
good
for
dundee
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
biscuity
sweetness
and
roasty
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
to
style
not
bad
d
a
pleasant
brew
but
lacking
a
little
of
the
warming
notes
overall
it
was
a
pleasant
winter
warmer
ale
pours
with
three
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some

nice
clear

1
75
for
a
12oz
from
barbs
beer
emporium
concord
nh
i
recommend
this
one
for
those
who
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
i
am
not
the
style
police
and
i
rate
accordingly
d
a
different
take
on
the
style
and
reminds
me
more
of
a
beer
i
would
drink
on
a
nice
fall
day
enjoyable
but
maybe
a
bit
forgettable
the
feel
is
syrupy
and
oily
smooth
buttery
this
beer
overall
is
a
solid
sweet
ale
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
a
nice
little
winter
ale
the
old
twist
off
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
tight
khaki
cap
that
retains
nicely
and
holds
a
good
covering
for
the
duration
a
little
lacing
would
have
been
nice
but
still
a
decent
looking
brew
the
nose
smells
like
ginger
snaps
cinnamon
rolls
and
subtle
floral
notes
maybe
a
hint
of
the
orange
peel
the
label
speaks
of
a
decent
malt
backbone
took
me
by
surprise
i
had
been
of
the
impression
that
dundee
was
clearly
incapable
of
good
malting
up
till
now
this
is
pretty
heavily
spiced
as
well
and
i
am
glad
that
it
is
without
going
overboard
this
is
a
pretty
nice
ww
taste
like
pepper
nuts
a
german
cookie
that
i
dont
normally
like
all
that
much
but
here
its
appealing
to
my
pallet
i
do
pick
up
on
the
orange
and
citrus
notes
more
than
in
the
nose
a
very
soft
and
silky
body
gives
this
offering
a
nudge
beyond
average
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
offering
that
wont
knock
your
stocking
off
the
mantle
but
will
give
you
the
flavor
and
spirit
you
need
to
make
it
through
the
holidays
i
actually
like
this
a
lot
it
has
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
that
along
with
the
nice
mellow
sweetness
and
the
dominant
spiciness
makes
this
a
drinker
i
would
buy
a
case
of
these
to
have
in
the
refrigerator
around
the
holidays
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
may
have
to
give
this
one
another
try
maybe
i
got
the
bottom
of
the
keg
pours
a
clear
amber
color
15
inch
head
with
poor
retention
and
very
slight
lacing
has
a
good
hop
aroma
along
with
some
strong
herbspices
fits
the
style
quite
nicely
has
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouth
feel
the
carbonation
level
is
a
little
high
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
smoothness
or
flavor
tastes
sweet
and
there
is
a
good
malt
flavor
hints
of
some
spices
in
the
background
present
in
the
prefect
quantity
any
hops
are
barely
noticeable
overall
a
smooth
and
fullbodied
beer
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
the
spice
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
in
the
dundee
line
drinkability
out
of
alot
of
the
dundees
ive
tried
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
out
of
the
bunch
this
brew
features
the
right
elements
and
spice
to
make
it
a
real
treat
during
cold
months
a
bit
thin
but
defintley
a
better
brew
from
the
dundee
family
for
the
price
its
a
pretty
decent
choice
very
drinkable
not
the
best
but
far
from
the
worst
which
is
true
of
almost
all
high
falls
offerings
the
mouth
is
a
trifle
thin
but
i
do
like
the
silkiness
not
a
bad
effort
would
be
a
nice
introduction
to
spiced
beers
for
lots
of
folks
its
worth
a
testdrive
and
the
second
one
i
tried
was
a
bit
better
than
the
first
not
bad
for
the
price
either
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
ill
be
using
this
as
my
winter
fix
when
i
get
a
craving
for
a
summit
octoberfest
drinkability
good
it
fits
the
profile
but
doesnt
excel
its
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
but
not
memorable
d
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
one
but
its
a
super
drinkable
middle
of
the
road
holiday
beer
at
a
good
price
not
overly
spiced
or
alcoholic
but
with
decent
character
this
is
sessionable
d
a
pretty
good
offering
from
dundee
better
than
i
was
expecting
given
my
past
experiences
with
this
brewery
definitely
worth
the
purchase
ok
i
am
finally
impressed
with
a
brew
from
the
jw
dundees
line
this
is
a
nice
little
inexpensive
spiced
seasonal
good
ambercopper
pour
with
a
monster
head
that
doesnt
leave
decent
lacing
and
ample
carbonation
bitter
scent
with
a
solid
malt
nose
and
a
touch
of
different
spices
needs
to
be
more
aromatic
filling
brew
and
somewhat
thick
although
the
finish
has
an
empty
bitterness
semirich
malty
base
with
hints
of
many
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
ginger
seem
to
stand
out
a
bit
of
honey
is
present
for
what
its
worth
i
was
impressed
by
this
offering
considering
most
of
this
brewers
products
tend
to
be
rather
bland
the
easiness
with
the
blend
of
spices
really
stands
out
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
pretty
smooth
and
this
is
pretty
dirnkable
its
just
boring
if
you
love
caramel
malt
then
this
is
probably
your
thing
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
bit
more
going
on
in
your
beer
then
this
will
bore
you
as
it
did
me
medium
bodied
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
a
bit
milder
than
some
warmers
but
definitely
worth
a
try
a
great
seasonal
i
hope
to
see
again
soon
d
not
bad
in
the
sense
that
it
is
offensive
to
my
taste
buds
but
i
could
find
something
better
and
would
not
give
this
a
second
taste
i
guess
without
a
freshness
date
it
is
hard
to
tell
the
age
of
this
after
learning
it
was
retired
makes
me
question
it
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
one
of
the
better
brews
in
the
jw
dundee
line
pours
transluscent
maroon
spiced
tart
malt
with
perhaps
hints
of
spiced
cider
rich
toasty
malt
flavor
with
nice
noticeable
wintry
spices
rich
surprisingly
full
mouthfeel
and
crisp
carbonation
better
than
expected
and
a
pretty
nice
beer
actually
a
good
seasonal
d
good
drinkability
high
falls
with
a
poor
mans
anchor
christmas
kind
of
overall
impression
there
is
a
fair
brown
ale
aspect
that
keeps
it
drinkable
but
not
festive
didnt
expect
much
here
it
well
exceeded
my
expectations
worth
the
6
996pack
i
think
ill
pick
up
another
one
drinkability
not
an
overly
drinkable
beer
imo
good
easy
drinking
beer
is
on
thing
which
i
have
liked
about
jw
dundee
beers
one
is
enough
for
me
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
for
a
winter
warmer
i
wished
it
had
more
flavor
as
my
notes
here
really
struggled
to
pull
those
out
a
interesting
but
conflicted
winter
ale
this
was
on
sale
for
5
49
for
a
six
pack
they
probably
figure
that
since
its
well
into
january
they
want
to
get
rid
of
their
christmasy
stuff
its
deep
brownishamber
with
a
nice
light
brown
head
i
think
it
smells
good
sweet
with
a
molasseslike
aroma
and
some
sort
of
spice
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
i
sense
it
in
the
taste
also
almost
like
a
bitter
orange
peel
type
flavorsmell
its
bittersweet
and
thick
leaves
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
some
alcohol
warmth
is
there
not
much
not
bad
a
couple
of
these
beers
will
suffice
on
any
given
night
id
have
a
couple
then
switch
to
something
lighter
ill
get
more
if
its
still
that
cheap
next
time
i
go
to
that
store
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
medium
carbonationreally
a
bit
thin
some
more
malts
with
unfermentable
sugars
would
be
a
nice
addition
to
this
one
sweeten
it
up
a
little
and
give
it
some
body
and
head
retention
i
would
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
this
beer
is
a
good
sipper
but
i
also
think
it
would
pair
well
with
smoked
turkey
or
maybe
even
duck
very
drinkable
and
a
rather
pleasant
entry
into
the
winter
brew
genre
the
dundees
line
is
surprisingly
good
for
the
price
i
havent
paid
under
5
for
a
craft
micro
sixer
since
the
early
90s
better
than
many
more
that
are
twice
or
three
times
as
expensive
a
nice
surprise
and
one
that
ill
have
to
seek
out
again
woo
is
lightly
spiced
the
taste
and
mouth
is
muddled
but
does
show
some
promise
maybe
medium
head
on
the
pour
lacing
is
actually
damn
fine
does
carry
some
strange
aromas
basically
weak
is
nice
for
a
winter
warmer
not
to
be
over
spiced
but
that
lack
of
body
hurts
this
brew
this
beer
is
just
slightly
lacking
in
many
catagories
it
has
decent
flavors
and
auroma
but
it
just
comes
off
as
being
slightly
watery
wow
this
beer
surprised
me
much
better
than
expected
pours
a
beatiful
amber
with
a
tinge
of
red
the
scent
is
oaky
malty
with
some
definite
spices
it
has
a
creamy
malty
flavor
that
finishes
with
spices
and
alcohol
i
thought
it
could
have
used
more
spices
to
mask
the
alcohol
and
the
palate
is
a
bit
filmy
otherwise
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
beer
released
from
the
12ounce
bottle
set
a
deep
reddish
amber
with
a
tall
creamy
off
white
head
that
stays
a
while
before
settling

forms
a
standard
thin
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
sweet
malt
aroma
chased
up
your
olfactory
opening
by
some
pleasing
spices
cinnamon
seems
to
be
right
caramel
and
bit
of
bakers
chocolate
at
any
rate
a
sniffable
beer
start
has
a
big
malt
sweetness
touch
of
bittersweet
spices
top
is
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
as
a
delectable

sweet

and
a
purposeful

quite
a
nice
drinking
beer

not

it

very
sugary
with

the

sits

not

glad
to
have
tried

a
good
beer
nonetheless

ales

thanks
jb
this
brew
tastes
very
much
like
the
backbone
of
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ales
without
the
pumpkin
very
drinkable
no
overwhelming
characteristics
and
one
for
the
holidays
that
will
not
offend
the
most
fragile
drinker
of
beer
not
really
that
crazy
about
this
one
and
usually
i
really
like
spiced
beers
i
guess
ive
just
had
so
many
other
holiday
spiced
beers
lately
and
most
have
been
of
a
better
quality
the
spices
in
this
one
have
an
astringent
bitterness
to
them
and
even
though
many
spiced
brews
have
this
character
this
one
lacks
a
sufficiently
firm
malty
sweetness
to
balance
still
its
not
totally
undrinkable
i
certainly
didnt
have
too
hard
a
time
sucking
this
one
back
its
just
that
there
are
much
better
examples
of
this
kind
of
thing
out
there

i

for
pours
an

with
excellent

spice
smell
is
fortunately
not
overpowering
nor
is
the
spice
taste
in
the
ale
itself
the
brewer
practiced
moderation
in
the
spices
used
which
to
my
mind
made
the
beer
rate
very
highly
on
the
drinkability
chart
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
spiced
beers
but
this
one
is
an
exception
and
ill
be
making
some
repeat
purchases
probably
the
first
time
ive
said
that
about
a
spiced
beer
this
was
better
than
i
expected
i
have
tried
most
of
the
dundees
beers
and
most
of
them
are
average
this
one
is
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
the
malty
nose
and
frothy
tan
head
start
this
beer
off
right
the
taste
is
a
biscuit
and
toast
blend
with
barely
any
noticeable
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
a
trait
i
find
in
all
beers
from
this
line
drinkability
is
good
i
will
look
for
this
again
drinkability
is
perfect
nicely
done
especially
at
16
99
a
case
of
24
overall
a
nice
drinkable
macro
winter
warmer
could
have
used
a
bit
more
variety
in
the
flavor
but
generally
pretty
good
crystal

average

and
lacing

in

with
just
a
hint
of

standard

and

theres
more

in
the
flavor
but
overall
the
spicing
is
very
well
done
nice
maltiness
good
balance
the
spice
never
really
gets
cloying
although
its
clearly
there
a
very
decent
holiday
spice
beer
if
i
see
it
ill
grab
a
sixer
or
twelve

or
xmas

d
hey
why
not

really
come
out
strong
just
a
light

nutmeg
flavor
it
does
get
a
bit
cloying
after
awhile
but
its
a
good
dessert
beer
it
went
well
with
some
of
my
wives
pumpkin
cheese
cake
i
would
buy
again
for
the
price
but
i
wouldnt
pay
much
more
for
it
overall
impression
nicely
balanced
the
spice
is
not
overdone
certainly
not
my
favorite
winter
beer
but
for
the
price
a
nice
offering
pours
a
nice
rich
amber
brown
one

tan
headwith
very
good

and

smell
is
of

is
thin
to
medium
and
carbonated
taste
is
of
spiced
malt
with
a
bit
of
honey
warmed
nicely
at
the
finish
this
was
a
good
beer
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
drinks
easy
for
the
abv
a
little
thin
for
a
winter
warmer
but
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
you
can
pick
up
for
5

a
sixer
was
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
that
my
dad
bought
this
was
the
first
one
i
had
out
of
the
pack
and
it
was
pretty
darn
good
a
brown
tinted
red
with
a
white
top
smell
of
spice
is
very
light
some
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
maybe
even
some
mace
there
is
a
solid
nutty
malt
body
to
it
this
beer
deserves
some
praise
for
the
restriant
not
to
spuice
the
shit
out
of
a
nice
subtle
beer
the
spices
are
part
of
the
beer
and
the
malt
character
still
shines
through
although
it
does
have
a
little
too
much
of
a
crystal
malt
taste
i
like
the
mouthfeel
and
think
this
is
another
sessionable
winter
suprise
anytime
d
medium
to
high
another
good
dundee
brew
from
high
falls
overall
not
bad
for
a
cheaper
beer
but
theres
other
stuff
id
rather
drink
a
decent
beer
and
cheap
fairly
well
balanced
expecially
if
you
like
banana

your
beer

malty
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
as
with
the
other
reviewers
the
spice
level
is
somewhat
muted
but
is
definitely
present
the
specific
spices
are
hard
to
detect
but
i
sensed
a
little
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
maybe
allspice
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
and
it
hides
its
6
3
abv
well
how
did
it
such
a
strong
brew
get
through
the
beer
cops
in
sc
drinkability
was
good
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
if
you
could
find
it
i
have
to
bear
the
honey
brown
to
have
it
around
these
parts
but
it
would
work
in
a
six
pack
id
get
it
again
if
i
could
find
it
that
way
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
yet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
there
is
a
faint
hint
of
spice
but
its
too
hard
to
tell
what
it
is
the
taste
is
average
it
has
an
extremely
dry
flavor
that
goes
down
slow
and
finishes
dry
and
earthy
i
guess
the
spices
are
cinnamon
and
clove
but
im
not
sure
its
quite
peppery
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
real
disappointment
i
dont
like
the
dry
element
its
one
and
done
for
me
limited
edition
beer
that
came
in
a
jw
dundees
12
pack
cool
fancy
metallic
looking
clear
sticker
label
this
poured
a
really
nice
orange
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
the
body
is
quite
carbonated
mmmm
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
sweet
roasted
malt
thought
i
smelled
some
clove
or
pear
in
there
not
sure
though
prominent
in
the
taste
is
the
roasted
malts
it
is
so
warm
and
happy
to
accent
that
we
have
some
mild
holidayish
spices
and
enough
hoppiness
to
provide
a
mild
bite
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
and
at
6
3abv
that
is
pretty
damn
cool
very
pleasant
beer
to
get
you
in
the
holiday
mood
but
not
a
work
of
art
drinkable
as
hell
holiday
beers
dont
need
to
be
hard
to
drink
anyways
high
falls
is
on
a
roll
and
although
i
dont
like
this
quite
as
much
as
the
test
bock
they
had
on
tap
at
local
bars
this
is
very
nice
very
interesting
brew
if
there
was
a
6
pack
of
it
i
would
get
it
crisp
fruit
apple
notes
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
with
no
lingering
finish
going
down
flavor
and
color
were
great
but
i
was
expecting
more
body
maybe
a
bit
more
spice
as
well
the
name
of
the
brew
is
cabin
fever
after
all
overall
solid
a
solid
winter
warmer
ale
an
excellent
winter
warmer
for
a
cold
night
indeed
great
flavor
and
lookthe
smell
is
actually
better
somehow
excellent
like
all
other
bbc
ales
ive
had
very
subtle
flavor
nothing
special
appearance
is
dark
tanbrown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
leave
trails
the
smell
is
a
lot
of
malt
and
a
little
heavy
the
taste
is
all
malt
and
very
warm
gives
hints
of
caramel
and
vanilla
but
isnt
too
sweet
very
nice
clean
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
also
nice
not
to
thick
but
still
had
a
nice
body
about
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
o
very
very
good
beer
very
solid
brew
true
to
the
this
is
a
very
satisfying
example
of
the
style
its
above
average
abv
creates
a
warming
factor
and
yet
is
still
masked
by
the
complex
flavor
profile
hits
the
spot
on
a
cold
night
o
reminds
me
of
highlands
gaelic
with
a
touch
of
spice
solid
offering
and
is
recommended
yet
another
tasty
offering
from
bbc
i
got
this
beer
as
a
sample
from
my
store
and
as
we
all
know
theres
nothing
better
than
free
beer
actually
i
stand
corrected
theres
nothing
better
than
free
good
beer
this
beer
is
bready
sweet
and
leaves
a
bit
of
cinnamon
spice
on
the
tongue
but
it
isnt
overwhelmingly
sweet
as
are
the
majority
of
winter
warmers
that
ive
tried
its
just
about
spring
time
but
not
quite
and
this
is
a
pleasantly
timed
winter
beer
on
a
cool
night
after
a
very
hard
day
of
work
while
watching
louisville
battle
for
their
second
championship
win
in
a
row
o
this
is
in
my
opinion
the
epitome
of
the
style
its
exactly
what
i
expect
and
look
for
when
i
want
to
drink
a
beer
like
this
i
dont
want
a
spice
bomb
this
is
perfect
for
the
season
and
a
great
beer
by
itself
well
done
berkshire
o
the
yeastiness
is
a
bit
strong
in
the
aroma
but
besides
that
this
is
tasty
and
drinkable
odat
first
i
was
a
bit
unimpressed
but
when
i
started
to
understand
the
beers
curves
and
intricacies
i
really
started
to
enjoy
it
a
mix
between
an
english
pale
ale
and
a
spiced
ale
i
will
definitely
remember
this
one
it
really
grew
on
me
by
the
time
i
was
halfway
done
with
the
bomber
my
fondness
for
this
beer
increased
twofold
cheers
thanks
to
bbc
for
restraining
the
hops
thanks
to
drewshal9
for
this
one
o
good
a
nice
combination
of
maltiness
and
fruityspicy
hops
for
a
winter
offering
better
than
the
average
indeed
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
im
not
a
big
fan
of
spiced
beers
so
i
will
not
hold
that
against
it
but
the
taste
is
kind
of
weird
i
swear
it
smells
like
a
bloody
mary
would
like
more
maltiness
perhaps
nice
beer
but
a
bit
odd
for
me
to
describe
overall
a
nicelly
crafted
beer
with
simple
but
satisfying
flavor
drinkable
not
as
heavy
as
some
of
the
other
bbc
beers
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
ruby
hues
in
the
light
about
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
develops
and
hangs
around
for
some
time
forming
pillowy
patches
as
it
dissipates
patchesstrands
of
bubbles
lace
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
english
malt
date
vague
citrus
predominantly
orange
caramel
cocoa
nibs
and
german
lager
yeastspices
the
taste
begins
with
the
english
malt
and
lager
flavors
moves
into
citrus
and
muddled
spice
and
finishes
with
a
strong
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
and
faint
chocolate
presence
it
is
a
bit
underwhelming
at
first
but
more
impressive
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
of
mild
carbonation
a
touch
more
wouldnt
hurt
smooth
texture
and
a
bit
drysyrupy
on
the
finish
not
overly
so
but
noticeable
overall
a
good
winter
warmer
that
ill
enjoy
sipping
on
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
d
pretty
mediocre
the
spice
character
is
bland
and
other
than
that
there
really
isnt
much
going
on
like
this
beer
alot
glad
it
is
reasonably
priced
and
widely
available
around
town
for
a
long
time
each
year
overall
a
very
nice
and
very
good
winter
warmer
its
certainly
different
from
other
ones
that
ive
had
and
better
since
the
citrus
taste
is
absent
i
think
ill
be
picking
up
a
growler
of
this
on
my
way
home
rich
flavor
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
pours
light
brown
in
color
with
about
a
finger
of
head
another
excellent
craft
beer
from
berkshire
brewing
and
at
a
very
reasonable
price
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
offering
from
bbc
always
good
to
support
local
and
this
one
is
that
the
beer
pours
a
light
light
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
spice
but
not
overpowering
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
beer
having
the
body
and
some
what
the
flavor
of
a
red
ale
with
slightly
sweet
and
light
spicey
notes
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
food
winter
warmer
without
being
over
powering
like
harpoon
o
decent
beer
not
amazing
though
i
had
it
3
months
beyond
the
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
so
next
year
i
will
have
a
fresh
one
and
we
will
see
what
happens
pours
a
bright
light
brown
color
with
a
singlefinger
offwhite
head
that
has
some
spotty
lacing
the
nose
carries
a
bit
of
light
caramel
and
some
bread
not
too
much
else
the
flavor
is
equally
bland
some
bread
maybe
bread
crust
too
yay
not
much
in
the
way
of
spicing
so
at
least
its
not
overspiced
medium
body
and
quite
chewy
blah
looks
nice
reddish
in
color
offwhite
head
smells
malty
and
yeasty
taste
like
an
alt
beer
yeast
perhaps
an
english
yeast
caramel
and
toasty
malt
flavors
end
of
the
sip
is
a
little
strange
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
bitterness
is
very
smooth
as
well
alcohol
is
masked
well
warming
without
burning
definitely
malt
dominant
in
flavors
happening
i
enjoy
a
winter
beer
that
isnt
over
the
top
spiced
out
tastes
pretty
good
edit
upon
examining
the
label
its
rich
malt
profile
is
reminiscent
of
an
english
pale
ale
aha
overall
i
think
this
is
a
home
run
from
berkshire
i
am
a
fan
of
their
pale
ale
and
with
the
snow
were
getting
in
ct
i
figured
this
one
would
go
well
with
today
im
so
glad
i
picked
it
up
this
is
an
easy
drinking
almost
pale
ale
like
beer
with
some
spicy
hop
notes
that
appear
in
the
finish
another
delicious
beer
from
berkshire
well
done
i
only
wish
i
purchased
more
of
this
earlier
in
the
winter
season
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
waves
of
smooth
malty
goodness
to
make
the
short
days
and
long
nights
of
winter
more
doable
d
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
one
is
enough
for
me
i
find
it
to
be
a
filling
beer
although
i
am
enjoying
it
over
a
meal
on
its
own
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
full
22
oz
bottle
overall
a
nice
brew
definitely
one
i
could
have
a
few
of
in
a
night
this
beer
satisfies
in
the
biting
winter
cold
without
having
high
abv
or
super
full
body
it
poured
a
hazy
light
brown
with
plenty
of
lacing
and
foam
the
smell
is
all
malt
with
some
caramel
aroma
the
taste
is
filled
with
malt
caramel
and
some
earthiness
probably
from
the
yeast
im
guessing
english
its
not
sweet
though
they
do
a
great
job
balancing
it
all
even
though
its
malt
heavy
i
really
plowed
through
this
22oz
bottle
and
enjoyed
every
sip
i
will
defintely
have
this
one
again
nice
beer
to
enjoy
a
few
on
a
cold
winters
eve
not
what
i
would
hope
for
enjoyed
while
on
a
trip
to
boston
great
opportunity
to
drink
a
local
brew
a
nicelybalanced
ale
with
a
spicy
and
fruity
hop
finish
also
carries
a
nutty
flavor
copperamber
in
color
but
mildy
cloudy
i
gave
a
little
ding
to
appearance
because
of
cloudiness
a
clear
beer
is
an
important
attribute
to
me
a
quality
beer
at
an
affordable
price
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
this
is
good
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
well
and
has
just
a
small
aftertaste
drink
is
decent
no
real
booze
taste
for
a
winter
beer
light
malts
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
sticky
finish
as
usual
a
solid
offering
from
berkshire
enough
complexities
and
flavor
to
keep
you
sipping
db
pretty
good
better
than
the
winter
seasonals
i
am
used
to
instead
of
going
over
the
top
with
spice
it
is
just
a
nice
regular
ale
its
local
its
cheap
and
its
good
its
overall
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying
for
sure
easy
to
drink
might
even
do
with
a
bit
more
booze
in
it
smooth
but
lacks
the
punch
i
wanted
nothing
super
distinctive
but
a
winner
just
the
same
very
worth
the
try
overall
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
young
old
ale
still
pretty
hoppy
it
was
rather
quick
drinking
above
average
but
nothing
i
would
actively
seek
out
pours
deep
reddish
brown
not
much
of
a
head
and
subpar
lacing
as
well
sweet
malt
and
fruity
aroma
begins
with
a
nice
caramelized
sugar
malt
malt
gives
way
to
a
good
kick
of
fruity
flavor
almost
fruit
punch
like
winter
and
grassy
spices
finish
the
beer
out
especially
as
it
warms
tasty
sweet
combination
d
this
beer
was
drinkable
not
my
favorite
from
berkshire
from
what
i
have
had
but
hey
you
cant
win
all
the
time
now
can
you
drinks
ok
nothing
special
but
nothing
terrible
either
really
reminds
me
of
an
octoberfest
with
winter
spices
added
md
ends
dry
light
to
medium
body
not
too
complex
but
pretty
enjoyable
curious
to
try
this
one
fresh
or
at
least
unturned
other
reviews
seem
interesting
but
i
guess
reviewing
something
blind
drinking
the
beer
is
all
you
have
to
go
on
d
a
solid
beer
id
definitely
drink
it
again
winter
warmer
bah
dial
it
down
a
notch
or
two
bbc
would
have
a
nice
easydrinkin
summer
beer
for
the
porch
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
very
good
beer
overall
i
will
pass
it
was
not
terrible
by
any
means
just
not
what
i
had
in
mind
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
some
nice
malty
flavors
to
it
and
the
spices
werent
overdone
pretty
enjoyable
brew
that
would
fit
nicely
with
a
cold
winter
night
this
is
a
tasty
beer
no
doubt
good
balance
nice
nuttyness
that
pokes
through
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
and
i
would
get
this
again
a
great
seasonal
single
you
could
learn
a
lot
about
winter
in
western
mass
from
the
character
of
this
beer
it
is
rich
warm
sweet
and
soothing
you
stretch
it
out
curled
up
on
a
couch
it
comforts
it
mellows
suddenly
you
dont
want
to
eat
your
housemates
youre
too
full
of
malt
and
that
snowdrift
that
ate
your
car
eh
youll
get
it
tomorrow
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
a
couple
of
times
has
a
big
frothy
head
sort
of
a
creamy
light
orange
color
it
sticks
around
for
awhile
and
produces
some
very
generous
lacing
to
it
the
lacing
really
adds
to
the
effect
on
this
one
it
sticks
to
the
glass
extremely
well
the
beer
itself
looks
a
little
lighter
than
several
winter
warmers
ive
had
but
still
quite
nice
looking
a
light
amber
color
at
first
and
when
held
to
the
light
looks
orange
with
a
medium
haze
to
it
ive
seen
good
looking
ipas
even
dipas
look
like
this
in
the
past
an
interesting
approach
the
smell
is
good
for
a
winter
warmer
pine
hops
stand
out
the
most
but
you
can
tell
its
very
well
malted
as
well
caramel
if
im
not
mistaken
most
are
generally
very
malty
but
this
takes
a
more
well
balanced
approach
in
the
taste
you
get
more
of
a
malty
flavor
sweet
malts
caramel
and
chocolate
well
roasted
and
then
a
mild
pine
and
citrus
blend
of
hops
tastes
even
a
little
herbal
mouthfeel
is
good
could
be
great
if
it
was
a
little
heavierbolder
medium
overall
with
a
nice
clean
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
and
very
drinkable
another
solid
brew
from
berkshire
drinkability
is
very
good
a
22oz
is
just
the
right
size
for
a
one
beer
on
a
weeknight
kind
of
night
i
could
have
this
again
d
this
is
a
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
nice
spice
flavor
without
being
overpowering
and
at
6
30
this
is
a
great
session

another
solid
offering
from

a
translucent
copper
with

loose
quarter
inch
bright
white
head

just
the

cinnamon
nutmeg

taste
consistent
with

however
there
is
also
some

pleasantly
malty
backbone
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
and
lively
with
a
little
prickliness
at
the
back
of
the
throat
really
quite
delicious
and
nicely
balanced
for
the
style
d
dangerously
drinkable
session
brew
for
the
cold

months
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
without
complaint
and
its
sweet
fruity
taste
hides
its
6
3
abv
enough
that
i
would
not
call
this
a
slow
sipper
paired
really
nicely
with
lemonbrushed
shrimp
cocktail
with
a
nice
horseradish
sauce
and
cream
cheese
covered
in
hot
pepper
relish
tasted
like
an
english
ale
with
a
lighter
body
some
doughy
yeast
and
more
fruitiness
to
it
finishes
very
dry
with
a
tannic
presence
really
seems
so
carbonated
i
wonder
if
it
is
finished
with
a
champagne
like
yeast
very
light
in
body
so
light
that
it
is
surprising
for
a
6
3
abv
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
because
of
this
but
slightly
not
my
style
its
easy
to
drink
and
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
high
abv
beer
but
i
wouldnt
order
another
its
too
lifeless
and
boring
because
of
the
over
attenuation
it
has
some
good
qualities
but
fails
to
come
together
berkshires
website
describes
cabin
fevers
as
think
of
an
english
ale
dry
hopped
with
german
tettnang
hops
i
find
that
an
apt
description
but
i
was
thinking
if
a
bass
ale
spent
some
time
in
the
gym
maybe
got
a
facial
balanced
its
diet
and
maybe
got
a
mani
and
pedi
it
would
taste
like
cabin
fever
aroma
is
prickly
pepper
noble
hop
and
fruit
aplenty
taste
is
a
similar
english
fruit
explosion
with
some
light
toffeealmost
like
a
christmas
fruitcake
really
really
really
clean
drinkability
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
be
dissapointed
by
a
bbc
brew
this
must
be
the
9th
bbc
beer
ive
tried
and
have
still
yet
had
one
i
didnt
like
an
excellent
winter
warmer
that
features
a
good
balance
and
the
light
fruitiness
holds
up
nicely
against
this
subtle
malt
backbone
good
drinkability
considering
the
6
3
abv
and
this
one
could
be
sessioned
with
ease
cant
wait
to
revisit
this
one
on
a
cold
winter
night
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
like
bbcs
products
and
put
this
on
tap
at
home
without
having
tried
it
an
am
glad
i
did
i
think
it
offers
a
nice
light
holidaybeer
alternative
for
people
who
arent
interested
in
a
heavy
bodied
or
overspiced
beer
two
items
i
like
i
expect
this
beer
to
go
fast
good
stuff
toasty
and
spicy
with
a
bit
of
warming
beef
to
the
body
this
is
a
solid
cooler
weather
sipper
clear
nearly
bright
amber
colour
with
a
short
cap
of
fine
light
beige
bubbles
good
head
retention
with
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
looks
nice
caramel
aroma
some
biscuity
and
bready
malts
with
a
slight
spice
fairly
mild
though
with
little
in
the
way
of
hops
bitterness
was
on
the
low
side
which
let
the
buttery
caramel
flavour
dominate
mild
spice
ginger
or
nutmeg
perhaps
with
a
bit
of
hop
flavour
midpalate
slightly
peppery
in
the
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
low
side
of
average
not
quite
slick
in
texture
but
close
warmth
wasnt
evident
on
the
palate
but
i
could
feel
it
in
my
belly
pretty
solid
overall
thanks
go
out
to
brothercannon
for
bringing
me
this
and
a
slew
of
other
berkshire
bottles
back
for
me
from
vt
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazy
tarnished
copper
color
with
about
an
inch
of
fluffy
off
white
foam
a
nice
layer
of
sticky
lace
clings
to
my
glass
with
each
sip
nose
and
flavor
are
of
mild
spices
toffee
a
touch
of
black
pepper
maybe
some
nutmeg
a
bit
fruity
and
some
floral
hops
bordering
near
full
bodied
for
the
style
with
ample
carbonation
tasty
stuff
thanks
again
tim
final
thoughts
i
like
bbc
a
lot
their
bombers
are
decently
priced
and
their
brews
are
wonderful
they
show
a
level
of
craft
and
love
that
makes
me
happy
to
purchase
it
time
and
time
again
overall
not
as
spiced
as
most
winter
warmers
which
is
actually
refreshing
im
not
often
a
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
an
exception
for
me
not
spiced
very
much
for
a
winter
warmer
which
for
me
is
a
plus
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
will
visit
again
next
year
this
one
shows
a
cloudy
amber
brown
color
with
a
fair
sudsy
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
gives
me
grapey
wheat
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
maybe
some
nutmeg
the
taste
is
oak
and
grass
and
dry
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
its
a
medium
body
brew
with
fine
carbonation
reasonable
drinkability
a
bit
peppery
not
really
calling
out
for
high
volume
by
my
tastebuds
not
bad
a
good
brew
pair
it
with
a
nice
winter
stew
or
a
game
dinner
heres
to
the
folks
at
bbc
reminding
me
that
sometimes
being
stuck
at
home
in
snow
means
cabin
fever
is
a
good
thing
yum
a
nice
brew
that
keeps
the
inards
warm
on
a
breezy
winter
day
poured
a
healthy
amberbrown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
left
a
nice
lace
across
the
top
the
smell
was
rich
and
complex
plenty
of
malts
up
front
with
a
caramel
sugariness
at
the
end
plus
some
earthy
hops
and
a
smokey
savory
flavor
that
escaped
me
could
it
be
tobacco
the
taste
was
dominated
by
complex
layers
of
different
kinds
of
malts
the
taste
had
a
buttery
flavor
to
it
plus
a
pinch
of
sweetness
and
a
pinch
of
nuttiness
however
there
was
a
hop
bitterness
that
balanced
the
flavor
that
being
said
the
aftertaste
which
lasted
for
a
long
time
was
a
little
stale
to
me
and
tasted
a
little
wooden
the
mouthfeel
was
about
right
appropriately
thin
and
carbonated
it
wasnt
my
favorite
example
of
this
style
but
it
was
a
nice
sipper
an
easy
drinker
for
a
winter
warmer
that
is
not
too
high
in
alcohol
content
just
about
right
cheers
after
a
couple
not
so
great
reviews
i
was
starting
to
worry
alas
it
brought
me
here
to
another
great
berkhire
brewery
offering
the
berkshire
coffee
is
simply
great
and
i
was
hoping
here
for
the
same
a
nice
dark
brown
pour
with
ruby
hints
and
short
tan
head
porterlike
lacing
the
overall
aroma
hinted
at
a
spiced
winter
porter
with
smoked
spice
malt
subtle
fruit
citrus
the
feel
was
silky
complex
while
the
flavor
had
good
malt
with
just
enough
hopbitterness
mild
smoke
black
coffee
a
hint
of
toffee
not
too
sweet
or
spicy
a
lovely
warming
ale
its
nice
to
find
a
good
beer
at
a
good
price
for
once
its
also
nice
that
its
local
a
beer
made
for
winter
cabin
fever
seems
like
it
should
be
a
decent
malt
bomb
with
a
warming
effect
i
cant
even
detect
any
alcohol
in
the
flavor
not
bite
no
warming
oh
well
very
comfortable
winter
seasonal
brew
might
benifit
from
an
increased
abv
to
get
a
warmer
fealing
or
one
could
put
another
log
on
the
fire
and
enjoy
a
few
more
mouthfeel
is
a
lighter
medium
body
which
adds
to
the
drinkability
i
think
this
one
would
age
nicely
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
liked
the
flavors
and
the
way
that
the
whole
beer
blended
together
nicely
done
d
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
not
the
best
but
certainly
respectable
pretty
drinkable
but
also
not
very
exciting
off
the
tap
at
the
daily
planet
in
btown
this
beer
was
a
hazy
dark
garnet
color
the
head
was
tan
with
some
reddish
hues
and
retained
very
well
as
a
thin
cap
and
laced
in
broken
curtains
the
aroma
was
caramel
malt
some
ripened
fruit
and
yeast
the
flavors
were
similar
pale
malt
and
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
notes
of
vanilla
a
little
yeast
twang
something
akin
to
strawberry
yogurt
seriously
yoplait
so
weird
and
it
finished
on
a
hint
of
hops
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
creamy
and
the
carbonation
good
quite
enjoyable
had
on
tap
at
union
brewhouse
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
ours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
smells
off
candied
malt
taste
is
very
mellow
some
caramel
with
a
finishing
kick
of
cinamon
and
spices
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
good
beer
for
these
cold
winter
months
a
nice
offering
from
bbc
but
not
as
nice
as
the
others
in
their
line
the
aroma
was
filled
with
autumn
smells
like
leaves
bread
and
tobacco
the
body
was
quite
smooth
perhaps
it
could
have
used
a
tad
more
carbonation
and
the
malt
was
front
and
center
the
alcohol
level
was
just
high
enough
to
add
some
warmth
it
was
just
right
in
fact
still
i
felt
like
something
was
missing
perhaps
it
could
have
used
a
little
bite
more
hops
to
give
it
a
little
boost
this
was
almost
monochromatic
a
little
more
balance
in
the
taste
would
vault
this
into
the
a
level
for
me
still
if
youre
a
bbc
fan
like
me
youll
want
to
try
this
feel
is
malty
and
the
body
is
what
i
would
expect
for
the
style
sweetness
is
getting
in
the
way
of
the
drinkability
though
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
a
nice
milky
creamy
thickness
on
the
way
down
its
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
with
goo
dbody
and
balanced
roastedsweet
flavors
top
notch
drinks
pretty
easy
hides
the
abv
fairly
well
an
englishslanted
winter
warmer
that
has
some
warmth
to
it
as
it
opens
up
the
name
kind
of
threw
me
here
when
i
read
it
for
some
reason
i
thought
of
american
pale
ale
however
the
taste
did
not
match
that
all
so
i
had
to
go
to
beer
advocate
to
figure
this
one
out
there
is
absolutely
no
hoppiness
in
here
this
is
very
much
a
malty
beer
there
is
a
hint
of
citrus
in
here
but
the
over
all
taste
is
malt
the
pour
is
a
hazy
amber
with
a
lot
of
head
as
the
beer
sits
carbonation
sit
continues
after
the
pour
i
really
dont
get
any
thing
strong
here
in
the
smell
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
nothing
over
whelming
or
worth
noting
here
a
maltaccented
brew
with
enough
juicy
hop
support
to
keep
it
tasty
and
balanced
very
easy
to
drink
a
winter
brew
i
could
drink
yearround
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
onefinger
creamy
tan
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
with
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sweetmalty
very
slight
spice
and
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
thanks
stan
and
andrew
great
aroma
and
flavor
make
this
beer
a
great
choice
if
you
can
find
it
overall
a
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
winter
warmer
this
beer
is
a
nice
surprise
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
amber
with
some
off
white
head
with
some
froth
on
the
soapy
side
of
the
continuum
the
beer
retains
a
bit
and
does
lace
the
smell
is
bready
malts
and
holiday
spices
nutmeg
allspice
cinnamon
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
coriander
the
taste
is
very
nice
in
that
youll
find
a
nice
balance
between
the
hoppy
dryness
and
the
malty
sweetness
laid
over
a
spicy
base
as
listed
above
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
decently
carbonated
there
is
some
caramel
and
flattish
cola
hints
in
this
beer
which
is
typical
of
spiced
beers
that
begin
to
settle
a
bit
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sharp
and
there
is
some
aftertaste
the
beer
isnt
brilliant
but
it
is
good
lchaim
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
straight
into
a
pint
glass
right
off
the
bat
i
noticed
that
the
head
was
thick
and
creamy
the
top
of
the
glass
was
a
dark
brown
the
seems
to
lighten
towards
the
bottom
great
head
retention
throughout
the
whole
glass
the
smell
is
very
sweet
but
a
little
hoppy
as
well
reminds
me
of
a
winter
warmer
or
sam
adams
winter
but
a
bit
better
i
would
definately
buy
this
again
but
it
is
something
that
is
a
bit
hard
to
find
the
perfect
winter
warmer
would
have
the
right
balance
of
malt
and
spices
this
one
is
balanced
and
still
quite
above
other
versions
of
the
style
bought
their
22
oz
a
hazy
amberish
color
with
a
thin
head
pours
out
from
their
bottle
very
thin
aromas
of
caramel
and
malt
making
it
not
too
strong
but
also
less
attractive
a
nice
taste
though
a
little
sweet
and
spicy
its
crisp
with
medium
carbonation
making
it
relaxing
and
refreshing
though
it
lacks
a
wicked
punch
smelltaste
wise
this
is
a
nice
drink
not
really
a
session
beer
or
a
sipping
beer
this
beer
does
enjoy
being
consumed
cant
figure
out
exactly
why
but
it
is
this
one
is
solid
in
all
areas
its
not
the
cream
of
the
crop
for
berkshire
but
its
still
nice
and
drinkable
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
as
its
a
basic
but
tasty
brew
attractive
coppery
color
with
a
big
yellowsh
head
that
fell
quickly
leaving
little
behind
spotting
on
the
glass
smells
faintly
of
caramel
malts
sour
cider
and
a
bit
of
spice
tastes
very
good
the
sweet
caramel
apple
is
tempered
with
sourness
delicately
bitter
hops
and
a
tasteful
amount
of
spice
nutmeg
cinnamon
the
body
might
be
a
little
too
heavy
and
syrupy
if
it
were
less
carbonated
but
they
pull
it
off
after
one
bomber
though
i
think
im
ready
for
something
else
a
nicely
made
warmer
from
the
bbc
ranks
favorably
with
most
examples
of
the
style
drinkability
nice
for
a
pint
on
a
cold
evening
but
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
session
would
not
be
my
choice
a
nice
flavored
winter
beer
that
is
just
spiced
enough
without
being
offensive
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
just
a
little
filling
good
representation
of
style
this
is
yet
another
beer
from
bbc
that
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
of
beers
that
i
would
choose
within
its
style
paired
very
well
with
a
seafood
dinner
coffeehouse
porter
i
was
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
and
was
very
pleased
a
splendid
brew
that
makes
me
looking
forward
to
the
other
types
styles
that
berkshire
put
out
drinkability
isnt
bad
its
a
tad
to
sweet
though
i
think
drinkability
is
about
average
better
than
plenty
of
overspiced
winter
warmers
but
this
isnt
one
i
will
likely
buy
again
very
often
really
a
disappointment
since
ive
liked
every
other
beer
ive
had
from
berkshire
ill
buy
it
again
at
least
once
to
find
out
if
i
just
got
a
bottle
from
a
flawed
batch
i
sure
hope
so
this
beer
was
a
darker
brown
that
was
very
cloudy
in
the
glass
there
was
cinnamon
and
brown
suger
in
the
semell
as
well
as
taste
there
was
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
to
this
beer
there
was
also
a
nice
spiced
side
to
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
it
was
drinkable
and
was
a
new
take
on
the
style
for
me
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
and
sessionable
really
not
what
i
expected
for
a
winter
warmer
lower
in
alcohol
and
milder
in
flavor
i
would
have
pegged
it
more
in
the
esb
range
a
surprisingly
fresh
flavor
profile
soft
in
the
front
but
drying
up
a
bit
toward
the
finish
a
great
accompanyment
to
a
meal
of
pot
roast
with
easy
drinkability
thanks
to

for
the

taste
with
hints
of
mellow
hoppiness
that
balances
the
beer
well
and
keeps
the
sweetness
in
check
so
that
it
doesnt
overwhelm
pretty
solid
brew
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
pours
out
a
nice
dark
amber
brown
color
very
hazy
red
color
when
back
lit
has
a
great
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
great
lace
all
the
way
down
the
pint
strong
head
retention
making
for
a
very
nice
presentation
smells
floral
with
a
hint
of
pine
sharpness
mixed
in
with
the
malt
sweetness
there
is
a
presence
of
dry
hop
floral
smell
as
well
very
nice
well
rounded
smell
a
rather
different
mix
in
the
nose
pleasing
to
all
of
my
senses
tastes
of
malt
and
a
floral
light
yeast
like
taste
followed
by
a
nice
citrus
hop
finish
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
nice
malt
and
hop
flavor
balance
well
constructed
flavor
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
i
enjoyed
this
brew
to
the
last
drop
and
i
would
certainly
enjoy
another
great
winter
warmer
offering
with
a
nice
full
body
another
hit
from
bbc
for
me
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
has
a
wonderful
soft
mouthfeel
it
could
use
some
more
spices
to
make
it
more
to
the
style
of
a
winter
warmer
points
for
appearance
and
aroma
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
fall
short
the
malt
presence
is
quite
thin
and
subdued
especially
for
an
ale
that
should
be
big
enough
for
the
cold
winter
months
very
drinkable
drinkability
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
downing
a
bomber
of
this
was
no
problem
i
just
wish
i
had
some
more
notes
ba
member
acarroll413
and
i
shared
this
22
oz
bottle
but
as
you
can
read
from
his
review
everyones
tastes
are
different
this
was
a
good
purchase
i
liked
this
beer
d
im
wicked
bummed
i
wont
get
it
again
a
deep
dark
ambercopper
colored
beer
with
a
light
haze
has
a
big
creamy
spoonable
beige
head
light
fruit
notes
up
front
peachapricot
with
some
coffee
notes
next
followed
by
an
intruigeing
grapefruit
hop
character
a
light
caramel
malt
character
first
then
some
roasted
nut
notes
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
a
smooth
light
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
beer
recommended
by
a
friend
at
colonial
spirits
ive
been
wanting
to
try
another
brew
from
berkshire
since
trying
the
imperial
stout
last
year
and
he
has
never
lead
me
wrong
before
so
let
see
what
this
beer
is
all
about
it
pours
a
candied
orange
similar
in
color
to
pencil
shavings
it
leaves
a
very
thin
white
head
thats
semisticky
but
not
really
clinging
to
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
surprisingly
fruity
peach
grape
citrus
the
hop
essence
in
the
nose
is
almost
non
present
as
i
taste
this
beer
the
hops
let
me
know
there
in
this
ale
then
a
fruit
essence
hits
your
palate
then
leaves
quickly
replaced
with
some
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
corriander
and
finished
with
a
squeeze
of
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
nice
ale
one
that
is
refreshing
and
i
could
drink
all
winter
this
beer
pours
a
very
clear
copper
color
with
a
head
that
dissipates
quickly
while
drinking
i
notice
not
much
of
a
trace
remains
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
certainly
not
strong
but
i
get
the
faint
smell
of
spice
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
quite
enjoyable
malty
in
nature
but
certainly
enough
hops
for
balance
with
an
overall
holiday
spice
throughout
i
like
how
this
beer
feels
in
the
mouth
with
some
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
will
not
be
a
chore
to
finish
this
bomber
another
fine
berkshire
product
crystal
clear
copper
colored
with
a
tightly
bubbled
very
thick
beigeorange
head
that
leaves
a
quarter
inch
of
foam
suspended
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
spice
a
bit
of
hops
and
sweet
fruit
flavor
delivers
an
upfront
puckery
bitter
nice
and
hoppy
with
citrus
but
not
over
the
top
followed
closely
behind
by
sweet
malt
and
cinnamon
some
ripe
pear
mouthfeel
is
full
but
fairly
tingly
with
carbonation
oily
webs
of
lace
run
down
the
inside
of
the
glass
very
tasty
very
drinkable
body
between
light
and
medium
a
tad
light
for
this
style
soft
carbonation
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
make
for
a
highly
drinkable
ale
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
the
nose
reminds
me
of
my
parents
old
compost
pile
that
i
had
to
turn
over
and
i
just
came
upon
a
bunch
of
old
grass
clippings
poured
a
thick
mahagony
in
color
with
a
slight
thin
and
creamy
head
flavor
is
havey
on
the
malts
and
has
a
creamy
taste
going
on
slight
hop
towards
the
back
end
the
spices
are
very
much
so
present
but
it
is
as
if
i
am
tasting
them
through
cheese
cloth
they
are
fairly
muted
full
body
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
spice
kind
of
hand
out
around
my
teeth
light
mouthfeel
but
that
doesnt
inhibit
the
flavor
works
pretty
well
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
warm
drinkable
lets
just
say
the
bomber
didnt
last
very
long
mouthfeel
is
full
nice
sweet
fullness
to
it
good
drinkability
but
a
bit
full
overall
excellent
a
good
winter
brew
distinctively
dark
amberlicious
lacing
all
over
the
glass
in
little
specks
and
boy
does
this
pack
some
serious
whiffs
green
hoppiness
with
hints
of
xmas
pine
and
gingerbread
dough
this
sure
gets
me
in
the
wintery
mood
light
mouthfeel
and
body
with
a
big
spicy
profile
first
thing
i
notice
is
a
sharp
licoricelike
bite
in
the
finish
my
tongue
is
left
coated
with
a
sugary
sweetness
this
is
where
the
mapleinfused
gingerbread
comes
in
aftermouthfeel
is
creamy
and
tastes
like
i
just
ate
said
cookie
repeated
sips
bring
out
a
little
unwanted
bitterness
around
the
belly
of
the
gulp
almost
like
a
stale
hop
or
waxy
burnt
wood
but
maybe
thats
part
of
the
warming
winter
warmer
warmth
tha
bitterness
seems
to
perk
up
with
repeated
drinking
like
a
toasted
cinnamon
stick
overall
this
beer
is
mad
complex
for
its
lack
of
weight
and
a
nice
drinkable
holiday
beer
bbc
continues
to
impress
and
this
beer
seems
to
be
getting
better
and
better
with
time
i
love
when
local
breweries
come
out
with
seasonal
offerings
ive
had
this
one
several
times
in
the
past
i
just
hadnt
reviewed
it
however
it
is
better
than
i
remember
a
winter
warmer
but
it
would
also
pass
as
a
really
good
brown
ale
medium
bodied
with
good
drinkability
i
agree
with
the
brewers
on
the
label
who
advised
stocking
up
on
bbc
for
the
winter
this
review
in
my
notes
is
from
121204
and
to
accompany
it
i
cracked
open
my
last
cabin
fever
as
i
wrote
it
has
held
up
well
a
very
nice
treat
unexpectedly
complex
and
very
tasty
i
would
reach
for
another
if
i
had
one
beautiful
amber
gold
in
hue
with
a
rubypurple
influence
especially
when
backlit
the
color
is
very
regal
modest
haziness
the
head
was
slightly
offwhite
in
color
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
one
finger
in
height
sadly
it
faded
quickly
to
a
thin
soapy
collar
what
a
bummer
i
mean
damn
the
color
is
lovely
i
wish
it
had
better
head
retention
there
was
some
subsequent
lacing
it
was
very
spotty
and
hardly
noteworthy
this
beer
looks
very
nice
the
nose
is
soft
the
potency
is
low
it
takes
a
hard
sniff
to
entice
this
beer
to
speak
to
me
i
get
an
interesting
dichotomy
the
malt
is
stronger
than
the
hops
and
the
malt
has
a
simple
english
flair
to
it
with
a
sweet
slightly
roasty
tone
and
a
kiss
of
caramel
the
hops
are
kind
of
spicy
muted
though
with
just
a
tickle
of
earthiness
in
fact
the
hops
seem
german
the
two
countries
are
not
a
war
there
is
a
good
harmony
in
fact
the
nutty
aromas
grow
in
time
i
even
get
a
hint
of
fruit
it
is
an
ale
after
all
i
like
the
nose
there
isnt
much
to
it
though
inviting
but
the
nutty
aroma
gets
a
little
loud
for
me
im
not
going
to
lie
sometimes
the
moniker
winter
warmer
worries
me
it
seems
the
title
is
too
vague
and
too
many
of
the
beers
follow
suit
this
offering
after
the
first
couple
sips
put
my
mind
to
ease
even
with
that
said
and
dont
get
me
wrong
this
beer
is
good
there
isnt
that
much
stuff
to
really
grab
me
the
malt
backbone
is
the
focal
point
of
the
palate
there
are
enough
malt
flavors
for
me
to
care
some
roastiness
some
sweetness
some
caramel
influences
and
even
a
tickle
of
biscuit
at
the
back
even
with
all
those
tastes
it
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
richness
im
such
a
dick
i
mean
there
isnt
any
wrong
with
it
i
just
want
something
more
it
needs
another
layer
the
hops
offer
some
spiciness
that
pierces
the
malt
perfectly
bitterness
is
firm
and
moderate
nutty
it
is
lightly
fruity
too
hints
of
pine
random
kisses
of
sugar
this
beer
has
excellent
balance
the
palate
is
plenty
articulate
and
it
is
saying
all
the
right
things
the
flavor
profile
is
good
medium
in
body
the
carbonation
is
moderately
low
but
quite
fitting
for
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
not
big
or
bulky
i
guess
this
can
be
expected
because
the
abv
is
modest
for
a
winter
seasonal
pleasant
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
i
mean
very
im
enjoying
every
ounce
of
the
bomber
this
is
yet
another
beer
from
bbc
that
is
very
quaffable
they
can
sure
brew
a
beer
i
want
to
drink
thank
you
ppoitras
for
the
bomber
this
was
yet
another
great
addition
to
secret
santa

pours
a
deep
orange
almost
copper
color
with
a
light
white
head
the
nose
is
super
fruity
for
this
beer
giving
off
some
citrusy
orange
strawberries
grapes
and
just
a
bit
of
hop
initial
flavors
give
off
a
creamy
mix
of
caramels
and
fruity
flavors
peaches
and
strawberries
are
the
closest
things
i
can
compare
these
flavors
too
the
finish
is
nicely
hoppy
and
slightly
bitter
with
a
nice
citrus
tone
there
is
also
a
bready
tone
right
at
the
end
overall
this
is
a
nice
winter
seasonal
considering
that
most
brews
are
big
bruiser
impy
stouts
or
something
of
the
sorts
this
is
a
more
subtle
full
flavored
brew
that
just
works
well
seek
this
one
out
enjoy
it
and
have
another
a
solid
winter
offering
from
berkshire

with
a
solid
nutty
aftertaste

brews

into
an

glass
formed
a
big
ol
inch
tall
tan
colored
head
on

of
a
quite
effervescent
reddish

dense

similar
to
a
bitter
with

small
little
kick

etoh
at
the
end
also
a
bit
of
fruit
flavor
skulking
around
not
quite
identifiable
to
me
which
gives
it
a
refreshing
crispness
i
didnt
really
expect
from
a
strong
ale
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
thanks
to
mikeys01
for
this
very
interesting
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
huge
flowing
tan
head
the
flavor
is
kinda
strange
not
bad
strange
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
malty
chew
to
it
with
a
nippy
hop
balance
slightly
fruity
mouthfeel
is
smooth
seems
like
a
solid
brewskie
not
sure
i
could
down
more
than
one
of
this
strange
beer
in
a
night
though
has
a
nice
orange
brown
color
a
tad
hazy
o
k
head
that
dissapeared
quickly
has
that
berkshire
signature
scent
fruity
peachy
honey
with
a
toffee
mix
a
roasty
fruity
honey
sweet
hops
taste
kinda
creamy
a
little
fizzy
some
bitterness
dry
clean
finish
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
the
desciption
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
flavor
is
big
and
malty
with
some
light
esteriness
and
mild
hopping
way
back
in
the
nosebleed
seats
sort
of
bland
and
simple
which
is
disappointing
although
its
a
decent
beer
by
any
standard
this
is
my
least
favorite
berkshire
beer
so
far
not
up
to
par
with
their
other
brews
in
my
opinion
22oz
bomber
poured
a
slightly
hazy
and
copper
in
color
leaving
a
very
small
head
the
fruity
aroma
makes
this
brew
enticing
from
the
begining
the
soft
buttery
taste
gets
dominated
by
some
sharp
fruit
flavors
like
banana
and
apricot
finished
peppery
and
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
the
second
brew
i
have
had
from
berkshire
and
i
cant
wait
for
the
next
a
growler
of
berkshire
pale
ale
showed
great
carbonation
with
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
the
color
was
a
caramel
dark
cherry
red
although
it
didnt
have
much
of
a
head
it
still
had
great
carbonation
it
had
a
full
body
that
was
very
malty
and
somewhat
thick
the
taste
was
strange
and
hard
to
decipher
it
tasted
of
cheeriescranberriesprunesand
cloves
the
taste
was
very
complex
with
a
definate
fruitiness
i
enjoyed
this
offering
from
bbc
and
would
surely
try
it
again
aromas
of

with
a
touch

amount
of

on
the
mouthfeel
very
brief
bitterness
left
on
the
finish
overall
decent
winter
warmer
that
is
enjoyable
far
too
many
spices
for
my
liking
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
it
all
year
long
not
my
fave
xmas
ale
o
3
50
this
has
been
shoved
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
for
weeks
i
finally
decided
to
give
it
a
try
it
is
decent
i
think
the
taste
is
better
than
the
nose
would
lead
you
to
believe
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
it
is
not
bad
but
there
are
definitely
some
in
the
style
that
are
better
overall
this
is
a
massive
malt
bomb
and
i
like
it
tons
of
toasted
malt
and
some
good
wellbalanced
sweetness
malt
fans
will
love
this
beer
hop
heads
not
so
much
a
wonderful
ale
my
favorite
winter
warmer
this
beer
didnt
have
as
much
of
a
distringuishable
flavor
that
i
liked
but
overall
it
was
still
a
good
fullbodied
beer
a
great
winter
warmer
love
to
drink
this
to
relax
on
a
cold
winters
night

maybe
wish
for
a
bit
more
hint
of
spice
and
a
stronger
nose
to
provoke
the
taste
buds
more
this
was
really
nice
with
some
homemade
mexican
at
a
friends
house
nice
balance
not
too
heavy
on
the
spices
refreshing
wasnt
expecting
much
but
this
was
just
a
really
nice
beer
one
of
the
better
holiday
brews
i
had
this
year
o
i
love
this
beer
the
aroma
is
weak
but
in
every
other
category
this
is
a
solid
performer
to
say
the
least
sa
can
still
brew
a
darn
good
beer
and
this
is
proof
i
love
this
beer
enough
to
buy
a
mixed
case
of
sam
adams
for
four
fezziwigs
dont
get
me
wrong
the
others
get
drank
but
i
buy
the
case
for
the
fezziwigs
wish
they
were
more
widely
available
as
a
stand
alone
case
as
lively
as
ole
fezziwig
himself
overall
if
sam
adams
made
this
in
6
packs
or
12
packs
id
definitely
pick
one
up
in
winter
time
sad
that
there
were
only
two
bottles
in
the
winter
sampler
a
great
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winterchristmas
brews
its
a
sweet
ale
with
hint
of
cinnamon
but
without
the
sharper
overly
intense
spices
of
some
other
seasonal
brews
im
talking
to
you
harpoon
winter
warmer
the
lively
pour
quickly
overwhelms
my
porter
glass
leaving
a
3finger
head
peaking
over
the
top
of
the
rim
with
at
least
2
oz
remaining
in
the
bottle
in
time
the
rocky
cremecolored
head
receded
leaving
scalloped
edges
and
moderate
lacing
there
is
a
nice
clarity
to
the
garnetbrown
beer
accentuated
with
ruby
highlights
the
brew
gives
off
a
mild
fruity
aroma
with
tame
holiday
spice
and
bready
malts
there
is
the
faintest
trace
of
hops
and
no
alcohol
in
the
nose
in
total
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
pleasant
but
muted
in
contrast
the
flavor
is
complex
and
bold
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
dance
with
a
ryelike
grain
and
fruity
esters
there
is
a
hint
of
black
licorice
sweet
vanilla
bean
and
distinct
cinnamon
and
allspice
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
mediumfull
body
theres
a
little
warming
heat
on
the
breath
from
the
spice
and
abv
which
is
just
south
of
6
the
distinct
sam
adams
flavor
is
present
in
the
backbone
of
this
beer
but
it
has
enough
character
to
stand
on
its
own
for
sure
winter
warmer
this
is
more
like
a
holiday
amber
ale
perhaps
my
palate
has
matured
but
i
seem
to
recall
this
beer
being
bigger
in
seasons
past
id
really
like
to
see
them
beef
this
up
with
a
higher
abv
creating
more
warmth
a
richer
fuller
body
and
more
potency
in
the
aroma
would
allow
it
to
stack
up
against
some
of
the
other
winter
craft
wonders
especially
if
they
are
going
to
put
only
2
in
each
seasonal
pack
for
what
it
is
its
still
a
delicious
brew
and
one
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
during
christmas
time
dark
amber
with
sticky
lacing
at
first
but
dies
halfway
through
at
ginger
and
orange
with
a
sweet
amber
chocolate
malt
sweetness
earthy
and
spicy
light
medium
body
awesome
beer
perfectly
serviceable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
made
me
want
to
gag
it
has
a
good
honey
nut
ale
taste
that
really
catches
my
attention
ehh
not
bad
but
again
nothing
special
really
wish
sam
adams
had
a
smaller
better
quality
lineup
no
hop
profile
at
all
apparently
i
dont
enjoy
spiced
brown
ales
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
good
seasonal
beer
it
has
a
nice
ambercaramel
hue
to
it
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
while
the
nose
on
it
was
kind
of
weak
i
picked
up
some
delicate
spice
aromas
the
taste
was
not
a
mess
of
overly
spiced
beer
but
it
was
very
lightly
spiced
solid
ale
with
a
great
malt
taste
while
there
is
nothing
that
stands
out
about
this
beer
i
think
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
during
the
holidays
if
i
did
not
have
to
buy
a
12
pack
of
sam
adams
junk
to
get
just
two
bottles
i
think
that
it
ridiculous
to
put
the
solid
beers
in
a
case
and
only
include
two
unfortunately
because
of
this
i
have
had
the
only
one
i
will
have
this
year
my
gf
stole
the
other
pretty
good
winterbeers
wish
this
were
more
readily
available
here
really
good
brew
o
while
this
beer
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
with
flavor
or
aroma
it
is
a
nice
seasonal
beer
thats
just
different
enough
to
drink
again
and
again
im
not
sure
why
i
liked
it
but
i
did
not
outstanding
but
better
than
just
average
i
only
tasted
the
base
malts
that
come
from
most
sam
adams
brews
not
the
ones
stated
on
the
label
not
worth
buying
a
winter
sampler
unless
you
like
all
of
their
stuff
then
it
might
be
a
nice
treat
pairs
with
some
favorite
holiday
tunes
with
friends
or
white
christmas
on
tv
overall
has
a
malty
and
balanced
taste
of
toasted
caramel
and
chocolate
hints
perfect
blend
of
maltsweetness
this
is
a
great
winter
ale
highly
recommended
overall
ive
choosen
a
4
75
for
samuel
adams
old
fezziwig
ale
boston
beer
company
samuel
adams
a
more
tame
choice
amongst
the
other
availible
winter
warmers
id
liken
this
to
an
imperial
style
of
porter
to
go
out
on
a
genre
limb
this
needs
to
come
in
six
packs
or
cases
where
i
live
so
i
can
enjoy
this
more
often
and
not
have
to
purchase
the
disappointing
winter
seasonal
sampler
pack
samuel
adams
old
fezziwig
ale
brewed
by
boston
beer
company
with
an
abv
of
5
90
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
old
fezziwig
ale
has
the
look
of
cola
not
saying
that
it
a
bad
thing
the
smell
is
rich
sweetness
and
grains
now
for
the
taste
it
is
sweet
with
some
grains
and
malts
you
also
pick
up
on
some
spices
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
it
is
also
richand
clean
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
it
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
i
like
how
this
brew
is
different
from
most
brews
on
the
market
boston
beer
company
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
im
giving
old
fezziwig
ale
a
4
25
out
of
5
o
this
delivers
the
flavors
of
a
winter
warmer
but
is
not
a
punch
to
the
nose
pleasant
and
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorite
sa
brews
this
is
a
bit
sweet
for
me
not
bad
though
overall
an
excellent
winter
beer
dont
miss
out
overall
a
good
winter
beer
just
what
i
needed
for
the
beginning
of
this
thanksgiving
week
upcoming
very
good
overall
a
really
good
balanced
winter
warmer
always
worth
having
a
few
each
year
o
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
for
what
it
is
but
probably
not
something
i
need
to
drink
again
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
red
amber
with
a
fine
half
finger
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing

of
sweet
bready
and
caramel

cinnamon
allspice
gingerbread

follows
aroma
with
rich
caramel
malt
holiday
spicing
leaning
towards
gingerbread
light
chocolate
finishes
with
cinnamon
and
light
hop
spicy
bitterness
really
quite
nice
creamy
medium
bodied
adds
to
the
holiday
festiveness
a
very
nicely
made
winter
beer
with
holiday
spicing
that
is
well
done
and
supported
by
the
malt
which
is
selected
well
to
support
and
allow
light
spices
to
be
the
centerpiece
uncommon
in
my
area
or
i
would
add
this
to
my
winter
holiday
rotation
my
buddy
asked
me
what
i
was
going
to
try
that
week
and
i
said
i
was
partial
to
an
old
fezzy
found
out
the
old
fezzys
are
only
sold
in
the
variety
seasonal
my
first
impression
was
of
a
good
cordial
cherry
from
out
of
the
candy
box
chocolate
cream
and
a
cherry
finish
boston
had
brought
back
memories
of
my
childhood
minus
the
alcohol
on
spot
feeling
of
nostalgia
this
beer
definately
impresses
me
because
the
goal
has
met
with
the
impression
for
me
anyway
all
the
notes
of
a
seasonal
beer
have
been
met
hazelnut
cinnamon
chocolate
coriander
and
cherries
this
is
a
good
beer
to
share
with
loved
ones
on
the
holidays
overall
this
is
a
great
winter
ale
that
is
super
malty
but
finishes
bittersweet
overall
a
great
winter
beer
dark
in
color
good
for
a
cold
night
great
name
easily
drinkable
i
would
have
it
again
overall
solid
beer
so
surprised
to
find
it
in
draft
this
late
in
the
season
ill
make
sure
to
grab
another
pretty
decent
special
release
similar
to
sa
winter
lager
minus
the
sour
finish
this
ale
also
has
more
depth
and
character
than
the
sa
winter
lager
old
fezziwig
is
perfect
for
sipping
with
friends
or
a
loved
one
around
the
fireplace
cheers
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
light
deep
red
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
but
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
of
spices
and
very
slight
fruit
tastes
of
citrus
and
spices
especially
a
cinnamonny
taste
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
light
bodied
nice
clean
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
sam
adams
and
one
of
my
favorite
festive
winter
ales
to
good
health
and
good
beer
dark
maroon
color
with
decent
off
white
head
and
mild
carbonation
fruity
spiced
aroma
tastes
alcoholic
even
though
its
only
5
9
mild
malty
flavor
no
real
hop
flavor
not
great
but
not
bad
mostly
spice
and
orange
citrus
notes
its
missing
something
this
hearty
ale
would
go
well
paired
with
heavy
meals
such
as
gravybased
stews
rich
toffee
malts
with
hints
of
chocolate
brown
ale
notes
cinnamon
and
orange
fruits
ginger
and
dark
sugars
alcohol
is
very
subdued
but
it
doesnt
carry
warmer
strength
perhaps
the
most
obvious
flaw
i
could
use
more
oomph
this
beer
is
smooth
and
tasty
enough
to
handle
it
very
soft
bitterness
is
leftover
from
mild
noble
hopping
carbonation
ruffles
it
up
a
bit
more
but
shes
smooth
and
malty
a
real
treat
this
time
of
year
overall
a
very
good
beer
from
samuel
adams
i
would
drink
again
or
get
a
6
pack
to
share
o
this
is
a
really
great
seasonal
by
sam
adams
its
very
dominated
by
the
spices
of
the
season
and
very
flavorful
but
balanced
and
drinkable
o
this
is
another
mildly
flavorful
easy
drinking
beer
from
samuel
adams
its
by
far
the
least
sweet
offering
in
the
current
2013
winter
pack
and
works
well
as
an
anytime
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
brown
color
with
brilliant
ruby
highlights
at
the
edges
and
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of
toffee
and
brown
sugar
with
a
heavy
handed
attempt
at
spicing
cherry
a
hint
of
wet
dog
and
earthy
herbal
make
up
the
rest
of
the
nose
the
flavor
is
dark
fruity
caramelized
sugars
with
a
hint
of
mineral
water
and
a
whole
of
spices
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
worlds
better
than
the
white
christmas
i
just
finished
but
still
an
over
spiced
beer
for
my
tastes
poured
a
nice
clear
brown
with
a
thin
ring
of
offwhite
head
nothing
fantastic
but
not
bad
looking
at
all
scents
of
cinnamon
slight
ginger
and
orange
peel
some
sweet
malt
and
some
yeasty
funk
a
pretty
good
very
sweet
aroma
taste
begins
with
sweet
molasses
malt
moving
into
some
sweet
spices
in
the
middle
including
a
bit
of
cinnamon
spice
and
finishing
with
more
cinnamon
spiciness
a
bit
of
ginger
spiciness
is
also
present
in
the
background
along
with
some
orange
peel
some
dark
fruit
mostly
raisin
and
bready
malt
in
the
middle
spiciness
is
more
present
on
the
finish
ending
the
sip
nicely
a
very
good
winter
warmer
with
enough
spice
to
make
it
to
style
but
not
enough
to
detract
from
the
malt
well
balanced
and
quite
well
done
with
a
good
variety
of
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
i
dont
normally
go
for
the
style
but
this
was
a
very
good
beer
balanced
between
sweet
and
spicy
not
overly
done
in
either
area
recommended
o
a
nice
if
not
overly
complicated
winter
ale
o
this
is
a
fine
seasonal
beer
i
got
it
as
part
of
a
case
of
beers
of
winter
and
will
certainly
buy
it
again
this
is
a
tasty
celebratory
ale
and
is
at
a
fantastic
price
point
get
this
if
you
have
the
chance
this
winter
and
try
it
out
overall
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
winter
mix
pack
spice
doesnt
dominate
the
flavor
and
the
beer
isnt
too
sweet
o
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
not
crazy
over
the
ginger
or
the
cinnamon
i
bought
this
as
part
of
a
sampler
12
pack
for
14
99
its
fun
to
get
these
holiday
samplers
and
i
wish
there
was
more
variety
in
my
area
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
nothing
too
special
not
sure
what
the
fuss
is
about
this
one
minimal
head
upon
pour
ok
aroma
nice
red
brown
color
had
to
sniff
a
few
times
to
figure
out
the
aroma
which
is
slightly
chocolatey
tastes
ok
and
very
light
somewhat
sweet
but
not
a
lot
of
body
slightly
creamy
cant
detect
much
ginger
or
orange
i
think
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
no
problem
was
expecting
a
more
complex
beer
upon
reading
the
latest
reviews
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
then
again
maybe
im
spoiled
after
experiencing
so
many
other
brews
a
very
decent
beer
that
you
can
relax
to
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
sam
adams
it
has
a
full
flavor
and
really
good
mouthfeel
i
look
forward
to
the
winter
variety
pack
each
year
mostly
for
this
one
samuel
adams
old
fezziwig
ale
3
55
o
nice
beer
to
have
on
occasion
as
the
holiday
season
progresses
o
very
malty
and
tasty
beer
has
a
lot
of
characteristics
of
a
stoutporter
but
obviously
lighter
flavors
are
precise
and
standout
clearly
great
beer
for
the
winter
the
verdict
pretty
good
a
decent
winter
warmer
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
the
tongue
happy
nothing
over
the
top
not
as
complex
as
some
but
still
a
good
solid
brew
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhitelight
tan
head
aroma
is
toffee
caramel
molasses
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
very
nice
taste
is
a
good
though
somewhat
weak
balance
of
the
caramel
malts
and
spices
it
tastes
like
someone
mixed
holiday
spices
into
a
boston
lager
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
thin
mouth
feel
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
but
not
my
favorite
holiday
ale
o
good
winter
warmer
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
holiday
seasons
to
come
i
was
eager
to
try
this
since
the
bros
gave
it
such
a
good
rating
since
the
bros
have
drank
so
much
beer
on
their
journey
through
the
matrix
we
consider
as
an
objective
reality
and
since
their
taste
in
beer
is
respected
and
quite
honestly
envied
any
time
they
give
a
beer
over
a
ninety
rating
i
go
buy
it
i
know
that
george
clooney
has
a
good
taste
in
women
since
he
has
sampled
so
many
just
like
the
bros
have
a
quality
acquired
taste
in
beer
and
when
i
had
this
beer
i
felt
as
if
i
was
batman
i
know
it
sounds
wild
like
jennifer
lopez
dating
maynard
james
keenan
from
the
progressive
rock
band
tool
and
even
if
that
could
only
occur
on
bizzaros
square
planet
then
good
i
am
fair
with
the
hype
that
responds
to
the
crowd
as
shawn
kemps
massive
thunderous
dunks
rocked
chicago

is

that

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
christmas
beer
although
the
spices
could
have
been
turned
down
a
bit
to
let
the
malts
come
in
more
possibly
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
now
tried
it
for
the
1st
time
this
winter
a
tasty
winter
warmer
complex
but
subtle
flavor
profile
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
it
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
very
subtle
and
plain
but
not
bad
the
mouthfeel
alone
makes
this
very
enjoyable
pours
a
very
dark
cherry
redbrown
in
color
with
a
1finger
tan
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
some
malts
hops
with
some
spices
perfect
carbonation
the
taste
was
excellent
with
a
perfect
balance
of
spices
and
roasted
malts
very
easy
and
smooth
to
drink
a
great
brew
for
the
colder
months
o
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
i
have
had
most
focus
too
much
on
heavy
handed
booze
this
really
has
a
well
married
flavor
profile
that
anyone
could
enjoy
i
would
love
to
drink
this
around
a
nice
fire
during
the
holidays
o
overall
this
was
quite
good
i
generally
prefer
my
winter
warmers
heavy
bold
and
with
a
high
abv
this
doesnt
hit
any
of
those
but
its
very
good
nonetheless
ov
great
beer
its
perfect
for
any
cold
day
smc
overall
it
looks
the
way
its
supposed
to
it
smells
the
way
its
described
yet
its
tastes
very
malty
and
the
mouth
feel
works
well
this
is
what
they
were
aiming
for
and
they
hit
it
on
the
head
o
a
really
nice
holiday
beer
that
i
hadnt
had
in
years
glad
to
come
back
to
old
fezziwig
unfortunately
as
i
said
i
find
it
to
get
a
bit
sweet
and
taxing
to
drink
as
it
warms
overall
an
exceptional
winter
warmer
definetily
a
good
creation
by
sam
adams
and
highly
recommend
and
will
revisit
next
winter
the
taste
is
gently
spiced
up
front
with
a
mild
dark
carameltoffee
flavor
in
the
taste
with
slight
orangeginger
mix
with
bready
light
graham
cracker
taste
overall
this
is
a
decent
spiced
ale
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
of
course
i
may
be
romanticizing
this
since
it
was
one
of
the
beers
i
enjoyed
when
i
first
got
into
craft
beers
still
good
but
not
exceptional
in
my
opinion
nice
frothy
beer
that
has
interesting
flavours
of
notverysweet
dried
fruit
malt
and
dextrose
on
the
finish
its
not
very
warming
but
its
definitely
a
good
allaround
beer
nothing
impressive
though
i
dont
taste
much
of
the
spice
which
is
great
because
i
hate
ginger
which
it
supposedly
has
in
it
this
really
is
a
good
tasting
holiday
treat
from
sam
the
smell
is
mostly
chocolate
in
my
opinion
and
then
the
taste
of
the
cinnamon
and
chocolate
compliment
it
nicely
its
almost
like
a
lightly
spiced
maple
syrup
with
carbonation
i
will
get
this
again
next
christmas
overall
worth
the
try
but
not
a
goto
beer
m
balanced
and
with
a
good
lasting
ending
start
with
some
sweetness
and
then
neutral
for
a
sweet
with
some
bitter
ending
overall
ill
be
honest
there
arent
many
sam
adams
beers
that
i
get
excited
about
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
few
a
very
solid
winter
warmer
and
the
only
reason
i
buy
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
every
year
recommended
vintage
fresh
o
a
great
take
on
a
winter
seasonal
very
balanced
considering
all
the
different
dynamics
of
this
brew
definitely
the
best
of
the
group
within
the
winter

overall
whenever
a

overallcomments
fezziwig
is
an
excellent
winter

and
my
favorite
seasonal
from
sam
adams
a
truly
excellently
balanced
beer
i
only
wish
this
were
available
in
6packs
and
not
just
in
the
winter
classics

old
fezziwig
ale
hit
the
spot
tonight
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
sam
adams
winter
classics
variety
pack
o
some
spiced
ales
get
it
right
and
this
is
one
of
them
no
doubt
that
old
fezziwigs
meaty
malty
character
and
oldworld
style
would
make
it
loveable
for
just
about
anybody
especially
in
the
colder
months
overall
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
this
reinforces
my
decision
to
buy
the
samuel
adams
winter
sampler
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
6pack
of
this
were
it
available
drinkability
before
opening
the
bottle
i
expected
the
festive
winter
spices
to
dominate
however
it
is
surprisingly
balanced
i
would
definitely
consider
buying
this
again
though
in
a
sixer
of
itself
i
think
it
is
only
available
in
the
seasonal
sampler
pours
deep
amber
with
a
light
head
pleasant
malty
scent
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
spice
sweet
taste
that
does
not
linger
and
fades
quickly
as
it
heads
toward
the
back
of
the
palate
decent
seasonal
beer
and
while
not
spectacular
makes
for
a
good
session
brew
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
nice
amber
gold
beer
the
beer
had
no
head
at
all
after
two
minutes
the
smell
was
nice
and
spacey
however
the
taste
was
not
good
flat
pseudo
christmas
taste
of
rotten
oranges
and
a
gruel
of
bacteria
from
the
bottom
of
a
christmas
stocking
that
is
60
years
old
that
might
even
have
had
feet
in
it
i
will
not
buy
again
i
always
enjoy
a
few
of
these
babies
during
the
christmas
season
but
onceayear
is
certainly
enough
for
me
good
for
a
winter
warmer
not
overly
spiced
malty
tasty
could
only
hope
for
a
better
feel
maybe
some
hops
the
taste
is
kind
of
toasted
spiced
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
i
found
the
aroma
more
complex
than
the
taste
but
the
taste
stronger
than
the
nose
had
the
two
been
reversed
this
may
have
been
a
classic
but
instead
its
a
decent
winter
ale
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
not
o
pairs
great
with
desserts
my
favorite
winter
warmer
plenty
of
spices
to
go
around
and
a
very
smooth
malt
bill
one
of
sam
adams
best
brews
they
should
sell
this
in
6
packs
just
2
make
the
mix
pack
worth
it
o
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
winter
beer
id
definitely
have
it
again
o
not
the
best
fezziwig
ive
had
the
spice
notes
are
very
light
and
the
aspirin
bitterness
gets
a
little
heavy
after
awhile
would
probably
be
better
after
a
few
pints
overall
despite
my
scores
this
is
not
a
bad
ale
its
primary
attribute
however
is
how
utterly
mediocre
it
is
so
far
as
seasonals
go
there
are
much
more
complex
rich
offerings
to
choose
from
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beerone
of
the
best
winter
warmers
ive
had
i
also
really
like
the
idea
behind
incorporating
such
a
festive
dickens
character
this
is
my
favorite
sam
adams
seasonal
and
i
would
buy
a
case
of
this
if
i
could
get
a
hold
of
one
rjt
overall
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
but
a
little
on
the
light
side
in
my
opinion
the
flavors
are
there
but
they
arent
as
assertive
as
i
would
expect
the
beer
smell
wasnt
anything
i
would
consider
any
better
or
worse
from
other
ales
mostly
hops
and
malt
and
although
appealing
nothing
to
consider
outstanding
mouthfeel
was
average
at
best
a
beer
with
high
carbonation
which
i
find
distracts
from
its
overall
taste
the
taste
was
good
for
an
ale
even
way
above
average
just
not
at
an
exceptional
level
i
least
thats
what
i
thought
overall
a
better
than
average
beer
but
nothing
that
i
would
consider
good
enough
to
rate
any
higher
than
some
others
ive
tried
for
a
seasonal
beerale
go
and
get
some
and
enjoy
but
dont
set
the
bar
high
just
enjoy
in
dickens
a
christmas
carol
fezziwig
says
its
not
just
for
money
alone
that
one
spends
a
lifetime
building
up
a
business
its
to
preserve
a
way
of
life
that
one
knew
and
loved
indeed
while
the
samuel
adams
brand
has
achieved
enormous
financial
success
i
have
to
believe
they
brew
good
beers
such
as
this
because
they
too
enjoy
drinking
them
if
im
ever
visited
by
three
ghosts
i
hope
they
bring
beer
as
good
as
this
o
my
past
memories
of
this
beer
are
better
than
the
experience
this
time
the
spices
were
stronger
and
that
telltale
alcohol
taste
wasnt
as
strong
the
christmas
cookie
sensation
was
much
more
prominent
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
o
pretty
average
but
the
taste
does
improve
as
the
beer
warms
i
expected
to
like
this
more
than
i
did
o
delightfully
smooth
in
feel
and
complex
in
flavor
old
fezziwig
is
an
excellent
winter
warmer
overall
i
enjoyed
the
awesome
mix
of
flavors
for
this
beer
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
with
a
lack
of
carbonation
ochocolately
with
hints
of
warm
holiday
spices
nothing
overly
complex
here
this
is
just
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
bottle
poured
a
brown
color
ale
with
a
relatively
large
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
light
toffee
and
nutmeg
notes
is
pretty
enticing
taste
is
a
good
mix
between
some
solid
caramel
malt
with
light
notes
of
nutmeg
and
balanced
residual
sugar
in
the
aftertaste
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
easily
drinkable
while
retaining
some
good
complexity
overall
this
is
a
very
good
winter
warmer
style
brew
it
is
a
nice
holiday
treat
and
i
enjoy
having
it
each
year
with
the
samuel
adams
winter
variety
pack
overall
a
tasty
winter
warmer
good
roasted
and
sweet
flavors
mixed
with
a
light
but
very
pleasant
spice
another
good
one
from
sam
adams
overall
sweet
and
spicy
more
like
a
desert
wine
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
out
of
the
sam
holiday
pack
an
enjoyable
brew
o
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
it
has
a
solid
amount
of
malt
and
seasonal
spices
everything
you
would
want
in
a
tasty
winter
brew
its
hard
to
really
fault
anything
here
but
the
malt
profile
seems
somewhat
onedimensional
particularly
in
the
aroma
still
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
that
is
wellsuited
for
the
season
overall
good
winter
time
brew
very
enjoyable
on
snowy
days
with
a
fire
going
and
a
glazed
ham
dinner
at
least
thats
what
i
like
all
in
all
a
good
beer
one
to
have
occasionally
but
while
the
complexity
is
interesting
in
the
end
i
didnt
love
it
something
to
bring
out
for
a
bit
of
variety
especially
if
someone
hasnt
tried
a
brown
ale
before
but
not
what
id
call
a
session
beer
probably
good
with
a
bratwurst
especially
if
you
add
sauerkraut
as
you
should
cheers
o
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
in
my
opinion
the
spices
are
too
dominant
in
the
flavor
and
cover
up
what
would
otherwise
be
a
nice
malt
flavor
i
suppose
if
it
were
snowing
out
the
spices
might
seem
more
fitting
i
could
see
this
beer
working
well
alongside
a
nice
christmas
dinner
o
one
of
my
favoured
sam
adams
beers
and
an
excellent
winter
warmer
drinkable
and
recommended
holy
smokes
now
were
talking
i
have
to
say
after
trying
most
of
sam
adams
winter
collection
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
one
especially
considering
the
silly
name
boy
was
i
in
for
a
shock
pours
a
beautiful
caramel
amber
color
this
chewy
creamy
bready
sweet
and
flavorful
beer
just
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
this
could
very
well
be
my
favorite
winter
style
beer
that
ive
had
so
far
this
year
this
year
im
thankful
for
old
fezziwig
cheers
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
but
a
unique
one
it
pours
a
mostly
impenetrable
brown
color
with
a
real
small
tanish
head
the
smell
is
quite
spices
cinnamon
citrus
peel
and
brown
sugar
flavor
is
pretty
moderate
on
the
malts
some
caramel
and
english
wintery
feeling
grains
but
i
taste
all
spice
in
the
middle
and
all
brown
sugar
or
molassas
in
the
finish
its
not
s
sweet
as
that
but
the
flavor
is
the
same
its
almost
mapley
too
and
as
such
might
lend
itself
well
to
some
time
on
wood
big
mouthfeel
lots
of
body
and
some
really
bold
flavors
vanilla
tinge
too
and
the
carbonation
is
fine
its
a
good
winter
beer
i
guess
but
its
not
a
drinker
its
a
slow
sipper
and
one
was
plenty
for
me
it
was
honestly
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
in
this
years
winter
pack
though
and
i
will
likely
let
someone
else
drink
the
other
couple
of
them
overall
i
liked
this
beer
hearty
without
being
heavy
and
with
a
great
flavor
onot
bad
not
sure
if
i
like
the
spice
profile
but
will
try
again
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
probably
my
favorite
regular
large
batch
sam
adams
brew
of
all
time
and
im
glad
to
see
it
hold
up
in
my
critical
review
what
a
winter
warmer
should
be
i
could
drink
this
all
year
long
maybe
it
will
eventually
come
out
in
six
packs
but
knowing
sa
they
know
people
like
me
keep
buying
their
winter
classics
packs
just
to
get
this
beer
o
this
beer
is
my
primary
reason
for
buying
at
least
one
holiday
variety
pack
every
season
but
i
still
miss
the
cranberry
lambic
overall
a
spicy
delicious
brew
for
the
holidays
i
like
this
one
a
lot
o
if
this
had
a
higher
alcohol
it
would
be
a
perfect
winter
warmer
still
with
all
the
herbal
spiciness
and
the
ginger
bread
cookies
all
i
can
think
about
is
cold
weather
christmas
trees
and
everything
that
goes
with
it
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
experience
with
this
beer
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
if
it
is
offered
in
that
fashion
id
also
like
to
add
that
even
more
flavor
comes
through
if
you
allow
it
to
warm
a
bit
allinall
this
winter
classics
pack
has
turned
out
to
be
a
winner
and
this
beer
is
just
super
feel
good
o
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
i
mean
this
as
a
form
of
flattery
ive
read
good
things
about
this
beer
but
it
fell
short
for
me
this
beer
impresses
the
eye
but
upon
further
experience
loses
its
balance
and
eventually
stumbles
o
great
beer
winter
warmer
for
certain
just
enough
alcohol
presence
to
warm
the
tummy
and
a
wonderful
drinkable
body
delicious
and
satisfying
overall
a
well
executed
winter
warmer
nothing
groundbreaking
but
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
a
good
choice
for
a
sessionable
winterseasonal
brew
this
beer
is
pretty
great
on
its
own
but
i
love
to
eat
some
good
white
cheddar
with
it
and
it
isnt
bad
with
oatmeal
cookies
either
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
i
wouldnt
describe
it
as
warming
me
was
nice
and
malt
forward
with
wonderful
complexity
but
lacked
defining
characteristics
of
a
good
winter
warmer
i
could
have
used
a
little
bit
more
alcohol
and
body
but
maybe
im
just
nitpicking
all
around
a
good
beer
full
of
flavor
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
very
sweet
and
malty
slight
earthy
alcohol
note
the
taste
follows
suit
very
sweet
and
well
balanced
slight
earthy
and
citrus
notes
low
carbonation
and
medium
body
and
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
an
excellent
beer
very
good
for
the
season
will
definitely
have
again
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
deep
clear
copper
with
some
ruby
along
the
edge
of
the
glass
theres
a
fingerlength
soapy
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
i
detect
the
aroma
of
orange
ginger
and
cinnamon
i
also
smell
some
of
the
roasted
malts
theres
some
caramel
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
of
caramel
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
spices
i
get
the
ginger
and
cinnamon
as
well
as
some
mild
orange
theres
some
back
end
hop
bitterness
but
its
pretty
mild
its
nice
and
malty
and
the
spice
and
hops
really
helps
balance
this
beer
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
an
excellent
beer
samuel
adams
did
a
good
job
on
this
one
tasty
and
fulfilling
this
one
would
go
great
with
thanksgiving

with
a
foamy

small
cap

foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
flavors
arent
as
good
as
the
smells
i
am
getting
o
this
is
an
interesting
winter
warmer
the
chocolate
and
caramel
sweetness
is
something
i
have
yet
to
encounter
in
the
style
while
it
does
account
for
some
nice
notes
i
cannot
help
but
feel
as
if
it
strays
from
what
the
style
strives
for
a
bigger
maltier
warmer
beer
overall
decent
brew
not
big
on
the
amount
of
spice
used
in
this
beer
and
a
few
other
sam
adams
fall
and
winter
seasonals
for
that
matter
but
its
decent
enough
a
nice
english
style
ale
straightforward
nothing
outrageous

a
nice
reminder
of
christmas
in
april
i
have
enjoyed
this
over
the
years
but
it
doesnt
seem
so
great
on
this
tasting
quite
drinkable
in
any
case
nice
low
abv
warming
beer
for
xmas
time
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
slight

brown
with

to
light

best
by

on
the
back
drinking
it
just
in
time
this
pours
a
dark
brownish
color
with
a
densely
bubbled
tan
foam
head
the
smells
are
of
spices
christmas
nutmeg
caramel
toffee
the
feel
is
medium
decent
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
lots
of
christmas
spices
nutmeg
peppermint
caramel
o
its
ok
getting
a
little
warm
so
the
temperature
isnt
necessarily
right
but
its
wholly
drinkable
o
a
good
winter
warmer
was
thin
on
taste
but
the
components
of
a
ww
are
there
o
i
find
it
odd
that
a
brewery
with
unlimited
resources
chose
to
release
a
sampler
pack
where
two
of
the
beers
were
brewed
with
the
exact
same
spices
orange
peel
cinnamon
and
ginger
referring
to
the
winter
lager
surely
there
is
more
creative
freedom
at
bbc
than
this
pours
a
dark
brownishred
thick
creamy
head
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
mediumbodied
feel
i
enjoyed
the
taste
and
aroma
it
was
a
bit
spicy
with
the
ginger
taste
a
bit
of
citrus
and
maybe
cinnamon
hops
are
good
too
not
too
bitter
not
too
strong
at

abv
very
enjoyable
and
tastes
a
bit
better
when
it
isnt
too
cold
overall
taste
is
both
sweet
and
spicy
and
this
makes
it
my
favorite
from
the
winter
variety
12pack
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
carbonation
is
lightly
prickly
it
is
neither
sticky
nor
coating
and
is
actually
more
on
the
refreshing
side
decent
but
i
prefer
my
winter
warmers
with
a
little
more
alcohol
o
a
nice
warmer
nothing
mind
blowing
just
a
solid
winter
session
beer
overall
awesome
beer
favorite
winter
beer
from
sam
period
enjoy
and
keep
drinking
salud
doing
a
little
ref
clearing
and
i
see
i
had
a
coupel
of
old
fezziwig
ales
from
a
sa
sampler
pack
the
beer
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
creamy
off
white
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
smell
includes
spice
and
sweet
malt
base
the
taste
initial
sip
was
a
slight
surge
of
alcohol
sips
after
briing
out
the
cinnemon
spices
and
touch
of
orange
definitely
some
caramel
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
o
not
great
only
okay
one
of
the
best
christmas
ales
out
there
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
usually
enjoy
most
of
sam
adams
offerings
so
i
was
not
surprised
had
a
good
smell
that
made
me
want
to
dive
right
in
after
the
first
sip
i
was
won
over
definetely
a
great
seasonal
beer
that
i
wish
was
more
readily
available
when
it
comes
to
winter
this
beer
is
a
great
holiday
treat
hopefully
the
people
at
the
boston
beer
company
will
make
this
a
6pack
to
enjoy
on
christmas
and
new
years
cheers
mediumbodied
with
gentle
moderate
carbonation
slightly
foamy
on
palate
not
harsh
somewhat
creamy
finish
is
semidry
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
singe
finger
of
light
tan
soapy
head
that
retains
for
about
a
minute
but
leaves
no
lacing
at
all
behind
smells
and
tastes
heavily
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
gingerbread
dough
very
festive
a
small
nitpick
i
have
is
that
the
citric
peel
hopping
could
stand
to
be
somewhat
more
forward
relative
to
the
other
characteristics
of
this
brew
all
the
other
hopping
aspects
are
firmly
in
the
earth
toned
spectrum
and
that
is
perfectly
fine
by
me
texture
is
again
slightly
thin
and
watery
relative
to
the
flavors
that
it
is
supposed
to
support
but
the
carbonation
is
also
kind
of
sluggish
as
well
for
a
winter
warmer
it
satisfies
but
it
could
have
been
much
better
with
just
a
little
bit
of
fine
tuning
o
this
is
certainly
a
quality
brew
to
enjoy
during
the
holidays
the
drinkability
is
high
with
this
beer
and
the
added
citrus
and
spice
to
the
chocolate
and
roasty
character
make
this
one
my
favorites
from
the
sam
adams
winter
classics
old
fezziwig
is
definitely
one
of
the
beers
i
look
forward
to
having
at
the
end
of
the
year
o
decent
beer
that
failed
to
impress
i
did
like
it
but
i
have
not
reason
to
seek
it
out
again
3
5
m
i
love
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
perfect
carbonation
medium
bodied
couldnt
be
any
smoother
or
perfect
even
has
a
creamy
feel
to
it
overall
one
of
my
favorites
out
of
the
winter
collection
pack
a
decent
spiced
winter
beer
and
one
of
sam
adams
more
interesting
seasonals
o
great
winter
warmer
goes
well
with
the
festive
season
cheers
notes
im
pretty
picky
with
winter
warmers
and
spiced
beers
in
general
but
this
one
hit
the
spot
for
me
it
achieves
a
nice
balance
keeping
the
spicing
in
check
enough
to
let
the
rest
of
the
beer
shine
oagain
this
is
a
very
good
winter
warmer
one
of
the
stronger
offerings
from
their
lineup
o
old
fezziwig
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
may
just
be
the
best
widespread
release
in
the
samuel
adams
lineup
its
a
great
winter
warmer
that
is
appropriate
for
all
cold
evenings
let
me
join
the
chorus
put
this
in
sixpacks
ill
buy
at
least
12
of
these
a
year
if
i
could
i
will
be
getting
this
beer
every
christmas
season
just
a
shame
i
can
only
get
them
two
at
a
time
m
toffee
chocolate
and
spices
what
more
do
you
want
from
a
winter
warmer
the
orange
and
cinnamon
sweet
ginger
toffee
chocolate
and
molasses
darn
good
overall
im
a
little
confused
by
the
taste
profile
they
were
going
for
here
still
once
the
malt
profile
comes
out
with
a
little
warmth
its
a
pretty
solid
flavor
ginger
lingers
on
the
finish
flavors
are
complex
being
both
layered
at
times
and
blended
at
others
would
get
a
higher
rating
if
it
wasnt
for
the
ridiculous
availability
of
only
being
found
in
sampler
packs
deserves
to
come
in
6s
looks
like
another
old
review
bit
the
dust
not
to
worry
i
have
no
qualms
about
reviewing
this
one
again
this
is
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
having
every
winter
recommended
overall
a
nice
christmas
beer
and
it
has
high
drinkability
taste
is
dominated
by
cinnamon
chocolate
ginger
and
orange
are
also
claimed
to
be
involved
with
the
flavoring
but
this
isnt
obvious
to
my
taste
buds
regardless
the
ingredients
are
melded
into
a
beer
that
not
only
tastes
great
but
it
also
has
a
very
satisfying
warmth
to
it
just
as
it
should
o
easy
drinking
with
a
moderate
amount
of
flavor
nothing
overly
impressive
but
a
solid
beer
i
feel
like
sa
is
the
kid
who
wants
to
be
liked
by
everybody
so
it
does
just
enough
of
everything
to
be
good
but
not
so
much
that
it
pisses
the
other
kids
off
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
other
beers
that
are
of
the
same
caliber
so
it
would
come
down
to
a
preference
of
brewery
and
price
as
to
whether
or
not
i
would
by
this
again
overal
this
is
a
good
beer
my
last
two
sam
adams
beers
have
really
redemed
them
in
my
craft
brewery
status
overall
the
malt
flavor
in
the
beer
is
a
little
too
spastic
to
really
make
a
cohesive
profile
the
spices
should
work
but
they
seem
really
muddled
which
is
unfortunate
o
a
decent
beer
to
be
sure
and
one
of
the
best
in
the
winter
pack
fr
sure
i
do
find
the
cereal
grain
aftertaste
to
be
a
llittle
offputting
but
the
spices
are
nice
and
the
malts
bring
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
one
sip
of
this
beer
and
i
fell
for
it
it
is
perfect
for
the
winter
season
nice
brown
color
with
a
creamy
brown
head
with
god
retention
in
the
glass
there
is
a
good
clean
mouthfeel
that
is
smooth
and
a
chocolate
sweet
and
bitter
balance
to
it
overall
a
great
beer
overall
its
a
solid
beer
that
absolutely
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
do
as
a
nice
easily
sessionable
winter
seasonal
recommended
o
this
beer
is
ok
i
dont
think
it
lives
up
to
what
everyone
makes
it
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
beer
overall
this
is
just
an
average
beer
to
me
nothing
special
and
once
i
drink
the
2nd
on
in
the
pack
nothing
i
will
seek
out
again
the
only
thing
special
about
this
beer
is
the
name
this
was
a
good
basic
brew
that
covers
the
bases
the
style
i
usually
have
a
few
in
my
beer
fridge
every
winter
had
a
bottle
tonight
at
a
friends
house
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brownish
red
colored
body
small
sized
head
smell
had
faint
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
holiday
spices
taste
was
good
but
didnt
strike
me
as
special
i
could
pick
up
the
spice
notes
but
the
orange
peel
stood
out
the
most
for
me
mouthfeel
was
on
the
smooth
side
and
a
low
abv
made
this
easy
to
drink
old
fezziwig
is
a
beer
that
ive
had
a
ton
of
times
but
never
got
around
to
reviewing
during
past
winter
seasons
thinking
about
it
now
its
only
a
slightly
above
average
winter
warmer
recommended
do
very
easy
to
drink
and
overall
pretty
tasty
but
not
the
greatest
example
of
a
winter
warmer
a
little
out
of
balance
but
a
nice
simple
spiced
beer
to
have
on
a
cool
winter
evening
this
is
not
my
thing
seems
over
done
a
little
watery
on
the
backend
but
still
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
mixer
would
probably
buy
this
in
a
6
pack
drink
a
pretty
good
beer
but
just
didnt
wow
me
like
i
wanted
it
to
couldve
been
a
bit
more
thick
on
the
taste
but
overall
one
i
would
come
back
to
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
but
it
will
not
be
a
top
10
beer
for
me
like
the
boards
list
it
o
decent
brew
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
goes
down
pretty
easy
personally
i
think
leaving
out
the
spices
would
improve
this
beer
one
of
my
least
enjoyable
from
the
winter
pack
mediumlight
bodied
slight
dryness
in
the
palate
malty
character
im
getting
mostly
caramel
and
toasted
malts
there
some
spice
towards
the
finish
and
aftertaste
mostly
ginger
o
i
did
drink
this
warmer
than
is
recommended
but
i
dont
think
that
even
at
the
appropriate
temperature
would
i
enjoy
this
beer
it
was
bland
i
couldnt
really
taste
the
flavors
that
were
advertised
on
the
label
poured
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
nonic
glass
served
cool
pours
a
light
beige
to
an
off
white
head
brown
red
garnet
body
smells
like
a
snickerdoodle
taste
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
are
present
up
front
some
hop
in
there
english
very
light
carbonation
is
a
nice
touch
ale
sits
on
the
tongue
longer
a
nice
beer
that
i
havent
had
in
a
long
time
i
will
have
to
drink
this
one
more
often
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
this
beer
after
having
it
a
few
days
earlier
i
tried
it
again
today
and
it
just
didnt
cut
it
some
light
astringent
bitterness
earthy
toasted
malt
and
light
dry
spices
that
mirror
its
aromas
light
bodied
and
mellow
finishes
slightly
watery
spices
are
light
and
not
overdone
rather
they
are
an
accent
in
the
aftertaste
that
compliments
the
primary
toasted
maltiness
lingering
dry
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
good
winter
warmer
fairly
middle
of
the
road
o
its
alright
easy
drinking
for
the
price
its
decent
and
the
family
or
inlaws
might
actually
drink
some
no
wow
factor
here
but
overall
a
pleasant
tasty
winter
warmer
id
go
as
far
as
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
put
out
by
sa
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
sa
holiday
sampler
and
i
wish
this
brew
was
available
in
six
packs
for
this
season
since
its
become
a
christmas
tradition
notes
a
very
nice
beer
lots
of
character
i
am
fan
i
wish
you
could
find
this
beer
in
cases
and
kegs
instead
of
the
winter
sampler
this
could
be
a
great
christmas
seller
for
boston
beer
co
o
probably
my
favorite
from
the
winter
collection
although
the
revamped
the
lineup
this
year
really
good
i
wish
the
carbonation
and
spice
didnt
over
power
the
toasty
sweetness
at
the
beginning
as
much
as
it
does
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
but
not
great
not
one
i
would
actively
seek
out
although
it
is
an
easy
drinker
the
spices
are
there
but
are
muttled
and
the
brew
is
not
that
complex
even
with
the
addition
of
the
afore
mentioned
spices
overall
a
pretty
solid
winter
beer
rich
and
well
balanced
light
chestnut
colored
with
an
oatmeal
brownish
tannish
head
that
settles
out
slowly
aroma
of
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
of
toasted
malt
caramel
toffee
spruce
tips
cinnamon
and
spices
notes
of
plums
and
prune
mild
bitterness
no
hop
flavors
even
mouthfeel
rich
and
full
finishes
tingly
tasty
beer
nice
full
bodied
mouthfeel
bitter
citrus
and
spice
balanced
by
a
malty
sweetness
with
earthy
nut
tones
high
carbonation
keeps
the
flavor
lively
o
winter
warmers
are
not
my
favorite
style
usually
bc
i
fond
them
overspiced
this
one
is
more
mild
on
the
spice
the
dark
fruit
stands
out
to
me
which
make
this
a
winner
in
my
book
overall
not
bad
other
than
the
appearance
overall
it
is
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
overall
easy
drinking
but
a
little
bit
forgettable
however
i
could
have
another
without
any
trouble
overall
a
nice
beer
to
sip
in
front
of
a
fireplace
on
a
cold
night
the
spices
give
you
a
nice
holiday
spirit
without
going
overboard
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
really
sweet
finish
is
a
little
dry
the
spice
comes
through
nicely
overall
the
beer
is
fine
i
like
it
very
good
for
a
winter
warmer
enjoyable
im
running
out
of
beers
that
have
greater
than
1000
reviews
just
a
few
left
now
overall
an
average
winter
ale
not
boldly
up
front
and
in
your
face
with
spicelike
flavors
like
many
holiday
brews
good
if
you
prefer
more
malt
tones
to
spice
flavors
okay
but
unexceptional
this
is
my
first
crack
at
this
beer
and
i
can
see
why
folks
like
it
though
not
entirely
my
thing
i
think
its
welldone
its
a
languid
sipper
and
i
like
that
about
it
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
another
night
not
ready
to
blacklist
this
just
yet
o
a
real
nice
brew
really
fits
the
season
as
well
as
my
perception
of
the
style
great
taste
appearance
and
smell
mouthfeel
was
a
little
funky
at
the
end
if
im
looking
for
a
complaint
jh
o
i
usually
only
get
one
holiday
12
pack
per
year
from
sam
adams
and
i
usually
get
it
because
i
remember
liking
this
beer
my
memory
is
correct
and
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
is
enhanced
with
the
season
much
like
egg
nog
i
love
drinking
this
beer
in
the
season
even
if
only
once
a
year
overall
this
is
a
solid
winter
beer
i
enjoy
this
seasonal
offering
from
sam
adams
and
will
purchase
it
again
o
this
may
now
be
one
of
my
favorite
samuel
adams
beers
unlike
other
spiced
winter
warmers
the
spicing
is
not
so
heavyhanded
that
it
detracts
from
the
toasty
malt
sweetness
that
is
synonymous
with
this
style
a
very
nice
effort
o
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
had
this
ontap
once
at
the
sam
brewery
and
it
was
a
real
treat
probably
the
only
reason
i
buy
the
sam
holiday
pack
every
year
mouthfeel
old
fezziwig
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
between
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
it
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
othis
and
osa
are
the
best
christmas
beers
almost
a
shame
you
cant
get
a
6
pack
of
this
such
a
wonderful
winter
beer
serving
type
bottle
overall
i
like
this
beer
not
my
favorite
sam
beer
but
would
buy
again
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
winter
pack
o
an
average
example
of
a
winter
warmer
personally
its
underhopped
and
under
spiced
for
it
to
be
a
great
beer
ogood
not
a
big
fan
of
the
spices
in
it
had
sort
of
a
weird
bite
to
it
not
sure
how
to
describe
it
overall
very
average
compared
to
many
other
winter
beers
overall
i
liked
it
much
better
than
their
winter
lager
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
i
was
glad
i
had
a
couple
in
the
winter
pack
come
to
think
of
it
the
holiday
porter
deserves
better
than
the
c
i
gave
it
yesterday
i
know
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
this
one
expect
a
rereview
o
this
one
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
flavors
and
slick
finish
meh
it
tasted
like
a
pinball
bouncing
around
not
balanced
the
ginger
was
in
your
face
right
in
the
middle
and
then
abruptly
ended
i
did
not
really
enjoy
it
c
o
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
and
below
average
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
winter
beer
but
not
something
that
will
blow
you
away
the
spices
add
a
decent
balancing
factor
but
overall
its
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
overall
a
very
good
winter
brew
you
can
find
in
just
bout
every
grocery
store
in
the
seasonal
pack
this
is
a
fine
winter
beer
a
good
inclusion
in
the
mix
pack
and
much
better
than
some
winter
warmers
ive
had
i
like
that
the
spices
dont
overwhelm
and
make
this
beer
taste
like
a
candle
its
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
dont
know
if
ill
buy
two
variety
packs
next
year
just
so
i
can
have
four
bottles
of
this
i
might
buy
only
one
pack
unless
they
start
selling
this
in
six
packs
please
bbc
o
not
a
bad
session
beer
for
a
cold
night
o
a
nice
winter
warmer
good
flavors
and
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
hops
level
and
spice
flavors
are
spot
on
in
this
one
but
like
most
spiced
holiday
ales
they
havent
found
a
way
to
control
the
medicinal
notes
given
off
by
the
usual
suspects
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
pretty
big
off
white
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
spice
forward
with
cinnamon
and
clove
followed
with
caramel
some
citrus
orange
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
noticable
hop
presence
creating
a
citrus
taste
on
top
of
the
spices
a
thinner
mouthfeel
then
i
hoped
for
but
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
o
this
is
a
decent
seasonal
but
its
one
and
done
for
me
not
quite
balanced
although
the
style
is
fine
and
it
does
its
job
as
a
warmer
in
the
end
o
good
winter
warmer
that
i
would
have
again
nice
to
have
with
some
ginger
snaps
clear
deep
reddish
chestnut
colour
with
a
thin
cap
of
fine
beige
bubbles
there
was
a
little
bit
of
lace
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
beer
disappeared
smells
sweet
a
bit
spicy
mostly
ginger
caramel
slight
orange
character
the
flavour
had
more
of
a
roasted
malt
quality
a
chocolatey
mid
and
mild
bitterness
spices
and
orange
were
more
muted
than
in
the
aroma
and
were
present
mostly
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
full
bodied
mouthfeel
that
starts
with
the
spicy
hops
maltiness
with
a
tad
of
semisweet
chocolate
and
a
warming
dry
finish
would
be
great
with
filet
strip
or
ribeye
o
i
like
the
flavor
but
there
is
nothing
special
for
me
try
it
in
the
sampler
and
move
on
overall
nothing
that
great
needs
more
flavor
too
watered
down
spices
add
flavor
as
does
the
sugars
but
the
ginger
overpowers
everything
making
it
unbalanced
and
forgetable
not
terrible
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
1111
are
the
rumors
of
this
being
in
six
packs
true
now
o
nothing
special
by
any
means
i
think
sam
adams
needs
to
rethink
this
recipe
overall
2
5
the
boston
beer
company
just
dropped
a
load
of
coal
in
my
stocking
of
aesthetics
someone
notify
the
bald
dude
with
the
heavy
metal
chinwhiskers
from
the
commercial
you
need
to
get
back
in
the
brewery
and
start
all
over
again
with
trying
to
find
a
holiday
ale
recipe
not
recommended
do
a
really
interesting
winter
warmer
a
good
one
to
bust
out
around
the
holidays
overall
a
very
smooth
holiday
offering
great
with
cheddar
i
wasnt
too
keen
on
the
ginger
but
it
didnt
hurt
the
overall
taste
o
i
like
this
one
better
than
winter
lager
more
flavors
but
not
thrilled
about
the
ginger
taste
overall
this
beers
pretty
good
but
winter
warmer
isnt
one
of
my
preferred
styles
overall
a
very
good
holiday
brew
pours
a
dark
red
brown
with
a
paper
thin
head
that
retains
aroma
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
with
a
range
of
spices
taste
follows
the
nose
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
chocolate
caramel
slight
coffee
notes
with
orange
cinnamon
and
maybe
some
ginger
very
complex
for
what
it
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
no
alcohol
detected
at
all
great
surprise
from
sam
adams
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
really
not
what
im
looking
for
a
winter
warmer
to
me
should
have
deep
dark
warming
flavors
the
brightness
imparted
by
the
ginger
and
citrus
made
the
brew
a
little
schizophrenic
not
to
mention
the
cinnamon
was
way
too
prominent
on
the
palate
and
the
finish
was
way
too
sweet
maybe
they
should
have
bumped
up
the
dry
roasted
character
on
this
one
to
offset
all
that
i
find
wrong
with
it
old
fezziwig
ale
just
screams
holiday
time
for
me
this
winter
warmer
enjoyed
in
my
st
bernardus
goblet
it
was
cooler
here
last
night
i
think
it
got
to
70
nice
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
warming
alcohol
on
the
nose
and
some
nice
dark
fruit
in
the
smell
very
smooth
as
always
this
beer
still
tastes
great
after
all
these
times
ive
had
it
im
not
usually
big
into
the
winter
warmers
but
this
one
has
always
been
a
good
one
for
me
why
o
why
dont
they
make
a
six
pack
of
this
for
christmas
time
i
dont
know
but
i
know
on
christmas
morning
ill
probably
reach
for
one
of
these
after
my
coffee
is
done
solid
for
the
style
not
amazing
but
good
inexpensive
relatively
easytofind
o
a
very
nice
holiday
beer
one
of
sam
adams
best
o
this
tasted
like
a
winter
warmer
produced
my
sam
adams
o
really
nice
beer
i
drank
this
one
on
a
warmish
night
but
i
will
definitely
save
the
next
one
for
a
chilly
night
because
it
definitely
has
a
warming
quality
to
it
and
the
spices
and
slight
hops
with
the
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
give
it
a
really
well
rounded
winter
beer
o
great
beer
that
makes
me
wish
i
had
it
during
the
summer
with
the
overabundance
of
citrusorange
taste
to
this
beer
it
makes
me
think
back
to
warm
summer
days
could
easily
sit
back
and
drink
a
couple
of
these
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
definitely
on
the
lite
side
making
it
easy
to
have
a
few
alcohol
is
nonexistant
in
the
taste
a
decent
beer
and
very
sessionable
overall
christmasy
wintery
holiday
taste
this
is
a
great
beer
that
is
extremely
appropriate
for
the
winter
holidays
and
one
id
definitely
get
again
the
last
two
years
something
has
been
missing
which
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
it
is
it
is
missing
a
certain
zest
that
it
had
in
previous
years
first
time
trying
this
one
from
the
winter
12pack
pours
a
nice
caramelly
brown
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
smells
of
tart
cherries
cherry
liqueur
some
spiciness
and
plenty
of
malt
taste
is
more
of
the
same
i
really
like
the
cherry
and
spice
notes
in
this
brew
something
a
little
different
would
definitely
pick
it
up
again
the
taste
is
a
different
story
this
beer
is
full
of
flavor
the
spices
still
remind
me
a
lot
of
octoberfest
but
the
taste
is
definitely
different
this
beer
does
not
have
as
much
of
a
bitter
taste
it
is
definitely
a
good
winter
beer
that
tastes
like
it
would
go
well
with
christmas
dinner
also
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
and
the
entire
variety
pack
that
it
comes
in
though
i
would
much
rather
have
another
winter
beer
or
anything
other
than
boston
lager
really
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
in
general
sam
adams
manages
to
play
with
the
formula
for
this
type
and
produce
a
winner
it
could
certainly
stand
on
its
own
and
in
light
of
its
seasonal
nature
is
certainly
worth
drinking
around
the
holidays
overall
still
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
beers
and
i
look
forward
to
it
every
winter
overall
a
decent
holiday
ale
the
malt
dominates
the
more
subtle
flavorsaromas
drinkability
is
fairly
high
o
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
a
nice
holiday
ale
that
is
just
a
notch
below
great
lakes
christmas
but
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
6packs
o
good
and
available
and
cheap
are
the
best
qualities
a
beer
can
have
and
this
one
has
all
of
them
the
favorite
of
the
winter
pack
o
great
tasting
beer
one
that
should
be
around
year
round
but
makes
for
a
pleasant
treat
during
the
winter
months
pours
an
intense
ruby
brown
with
a
healthy
layer
of
foam
sitting
atop
it
i
pick
up
a
nicely
spiced
aroma
of
allspice
and
cloves
along
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
maltiness
it
tastes
like
a
spiced
irish
red
ale
only
instead
of
a
dry
finish
its
sweet
and
lingering
the
mulling
spices
play
well
with
this
beer
and
i
find
it
enjoyable
o
this
makes
for
another
standout
brew
in
sams
winter
pack
line
up
a
great
easy
drinking
ale
with
enough
flavor
and
liveliness
to
keep
you
wanting
more
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
looked
forward
to
every
year
12
oz
into
a
tulip
about
a
middle
of
the
road
winter
warmer
once
again
samuel
adams
fails
to
make
an
exceptional
ale
they
should
just
give
up
on
ales
and
focus
on
lagering
this
isnt
as
bad
as
some
of
their
ales
but
its
not
great
spice
profile
doesnt
impress
too
much
nose
and
tongue
tell
me
its
onedimensional
not
always
a
bad
thing
for
certain
styles
but
not
winter
warmers
part
of
a
sampler
pack
for
the
holidays
not
really
recommended
but
not
atrocious
o
this
beer
is
ok
its
definitely
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
i
enjoy
blvd
nut
cracker
a
bit
better
imo
well
its
easy
to
drink
but
comes
across
tasting
almost
like
a
belgian
beer
the
orange
peel
and
ginger
combined
are
a
little
unusual
and
the
cinnamon
is
so
faint
as
to
be
nonexistent
ill
probably
pass
in
the
future
o
nicely
balanced
winter
warmer
spices
never
become
over
powering
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
out
there
it
has
a
lot
of
amazing
tastes
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
odpretty
good
winter
warmer
light
spicy
and
easy
to
drink
surprised
this
hasnt
been
released
in
a
six
pack
solid
winter
beer
i
recommend
letting
this
beer
warm
up
a
little
its
nowhere
near
as
flavorful
cold
also
some
the
carbonation
fades
which
also
makes
it
more
enjoyable

this
is
a
very
unique
and
nice
beer
i
remember
5
years
ago
when
this
was
my
last
beer
to
drink
besides
the
cranberry
limb
glad
my
tastes
of
developed
o
a
nice
easy
to
drink
winter
warmer
at
just
under
6
its
perfectly
balanced
for
the
season
o
i
think
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
it
just
feels
right
from
a
philosophical
perspective
this
beer
is
perfect
as
a
beer
its
ok
but
since
it
feels
transcendental
i
like
it

spices
taste
is
very
crisp
which
was
pleasantly
surprising
the
spices
reflect
the
aroma
ginger
and
orange
predominate
as
it
warms
it
releases
a
firm
note
of
alchohol
very
warming
like
it
for
sure
o
a
nice
beer
but
i
guess
i
am
not
as
enthusiastic
as
others
in
my
appreciation
for
this
one
solid
but
average
imho
as
a
brown
ale
i
know
of
better
as
a
winter
warmer
im
not
getting
the
spiciness
i
would
expect
overall
sam
adams
seems
to
put
out
these
beers
as
semi
true
to
style
brews
and
surprisingly
they
still
hold
up
for
me
because
mostly
the
price
for
12
dollars
for
a
variety
of
12
i
am
happy
does
this
hold
up
to
other
winter
warmers
barely
is
it
good
and
for
a
good
price
definitely
o
quite
impressed
with
this
one
its
not
quite
winter
yet
but
i
can
imagine
sitting
around
the
glow
of
a
fireplace
during
a
cold
winter
night
drinking
this
a
really
solid
winter
offering
from
bbc
i
think
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
so
i
cant
compare
with
others
but
overall
its
a
great
brew
wellbalanced
and
for
sure
the
most
complex
taste
ive
had
in
a
bbc
beer
i
say
well
done
like
many
other
people
i
wish
this
beer
was
available
in
6
packs
it
is
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
variety
pack
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
wellbalanced
beer
and
thankfully
moderate
in
its
application
of
spices
many
christmas
beers
seem
to
try
and
mask
the
flavor
of
subpar
malts
with
heavy
spices
but
sam
adams
has
mastered
the
talent
of
letting
the
spices
catalyze
the
malts
swirling
with
them
in
a
generative
tasty
dance
my
aggro
pour
netted
me
not
only
some
cascading
action
but
also
two
foamy
fingers
worth
of
mochatan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
reddishbrown
with
ruby
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
like
mexican
chocolate
sweet
but
laced
with
a
light
spiciness
milk
chocolate
and
cinnamon
to
be
more
precise
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pleasant
cinnamonclove
the
neck
label
mentioned
ginger
flavor
in
the
mouth
finish
had
more
of
the
chocolate
taste
that
i
experienced
on
the
nose
my
but
this
was
good
on
a
snow
day
when
the
schools
were
closed
i
shoveled
my
walk
early
and
simply
spent
the
day
chillaxing
as
my
students
would
say
definitely
worth
the
cost
of
the
mixed
12pack
nary
a
clinker
in
the
bunch
o
its
nice
too
bad
its
not
in
a
six
pack
many
a
friend
could
enjoy
the
ol
fezzi
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
finger
of
beige
head
caramel
in
the
nose
slightly
fruity
with
notes
of
spice
toasty
toffee
and
caramel
in
the
taste
with
flavors
of
orange
raisins
cinnamon
medium
mouthfeel
slightly
syrupy
and
pretty
drinkable
the
fezziwig
pours
out
as
an
amberish
orange
color
its
got
a
white
head
on
it
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
at
times
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
spicy
smelling
and
has
a
little
bit
of
an
orange
peel
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
similar
to
some
belgian
ales
out
there
the
spices
really
come
through
and
mix
with
the
citrusy
notes
this
beer
has
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
overall
its
an
interesting
brew
and
worthy
of
giving
it
a
try
overall
old
fezziwig
ale
is
another
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
although
its
listed
as
a
winter
warmer
it
has
traits
that
make
it
similar
to
a
belgian
dark
ale
regardless
of
the
classification
it
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
complex
nose
and
taste
that
all
ties
in
well
together
overall
this
is
good
and
a
nice
winter
beer
but
just
not
my
favorite
style
i
drink
this
every
year
with
the
sam
adams
winter
packs
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
each
year
i
seem
to
enjoy
this
more
so
its
slowly
growing
on
me
much
like
the
christmas
tale
that
the
artwork
is
based
on
bah
humbug
tried
this
beer
as
part
of
their
holiday
sampler
first
sam
adams
ive
had
that
was
wholly
unimpressed
with
smell
was
ok
but
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
unimpressive
would
not
recommend
im
a
big
fan
of
sam
adams
in
general
but
they
phoned
this
one
in
defininatly
lowered
their
bar
here
pours
a
dark
brown
with
decent
long
lasting
head
strong
scent
of
sweet
malts
and
cocoa
heavy
taste
that
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
a
touch
of
spice
thrown
in
for
the
mix
a
very
nice
winter
a
must
try
o
not
much
happening
here
here
we
are
yet
again
with
another
sa
brew
im
a
little
late
on
this
one
however
this
review
was
written
from
notes
and
what
have
you
right
off
the
bat
this
doesnt
look
like
your
normal
sa
beer
its
also
one
of
the
few
sas
that
doesnt
have
that
classic
sa
taste
not
sure
what
it
is
but
most
have
a
certain
notemaybe
the
yeast
that
gives
it
that
sa
characteristic
this
really
hits
the
spot
on
a
cold
day
and
as
i
said
winter
warmer
is
a
really
overlooked
style
i
believe
this
is
caused
by
its
lack
of
a
wow
factor
theyre
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
which
keeps
the
customer
from
coming
back
for
more
overall
a
good
beer
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
but
i
will
however
look
forward
to
it
coming
in
my
sa
variety
packs
stay
thirsty
my
friends
taste
is
malty
and
roasty
with
a
sweet
spiciness
definitely
cold
weather
beer
with
a
nice
warming
sensation
and
little
trace
of
the
alcohol
this
one
is
different
and
has
a
unique
flavor
and
is
also
quite
drinkable
o
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
fullbodied
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
because
its
more
sessionable
this
is
a
nice
enough
beer
but
i
am
not
going
to
join
the
masses
that
look
forward
to
the
winter
pack
solely
for
this
beer
it
does
give
a
great
first
impression
pouring
with
a
rich
garnettinged
brown
color
and
topped
with
a
thick
creamy
sandcolored
head
the
aroma
is
quite
inviting
with
fresh
cherries
caramel
and
biscuits
all
melding
into
a
wonder
malty
sweetness
there
is
something
a
bit
off
about
the
flavor
though
all
of
the
same
sweet
malt
characteristics
are
there
but
there
is
also
a
dull
nondescript
bitterness
that
is
presumably
from
the
aging
combination
of
spices
and
hops
although
i
am
drinking
before
the
bestby
date
there
is
a
solid
body
and
a
pleasant
moderate
carbonation
but
the
texture
cant
right
the
wrongs
from
the
flavor
overall
there
is
certainly
something
a
little
different
and
enticing
about
this
beer
but
the
weird
bittering
really
detracts
from
the
overall
impression
mf
creamy
and
full
blodied
with
flavors
that
linger
ill
give
it
good
marks
on
drinkability
it
is
a
nice
tasting
ale
it
isnt
overbearing
or
too
expensive
if
i
were
throwing
a
holiday
party
i
would
serve
it
without
too
much
expectation
of
complaint
from
both
beer
drinkers
and
people
who
just
drink
beer
old
fezziwig
takes
me
back
to
when
i
was
a
young
boy
watching
a
christmas
carol
i
probably
had
a
glass
of
fizzy
root
beer
anyway
this
winter
ale
is
everything
a
winter
ale
should
be
big
spicy
and
warms
you
up
on
a
cold
day
i
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
very
dark
reddish
brown
color
and
produced
a
thick
white
head
the
lacing
of
this
beer
was
outstanding
the
aroma
was
filled
with
a
spicy
mix
of
ginger
and
cinnamon
medium
body
and
had
traces
of
chocolate
and
burnt
malt
slight
traces
of
ginger
were
also
present
the
finish
was
nice
and
warm
perfect
for
a
winter
ale
overall
i
hate
to
jump
on
the
not
as
good
as
last
year
bandwagon
but
this
years
was
a
little
lacking
in
years
past
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
tastes
kinda
like
cocoa
mix
with
water
and
spices
mixed
in
which
isnt
horrible
i
expect
more
body
more
malt
character
and
more
balance
overall
it
is
a
very
satisfying
seasonal
ale
that
had
all
of
its
flavors
melding
very
well
thus
producing
a
very
tasty
brew
d
well
balanced
overall
and
the
thinner
body
makes
this
easier
to
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
id
enjoy
this
with
a
meal
preferably
or
with
a
chocolatecoffee
based
dessert
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
is
quite
enjoyable
the
cpj
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
winter
warmer
from
sam
adams
i
wish
they
sold
these
in
sixers
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
all
through
the
holidays
pretty
good
beer
overall
definitely
seasonal
and
a
good
display
of
unique
ingredients
a
nice
selection
from
their
winter
seasonals
12
pack
but
i
wouldnt
want
this
one
all
the
time
last
thing
i
will
add
is
props
to
boston
beer
company
for
giving
us
a
good
interesting
beer
without
a
bunch
of
snooty
pretentious
packaging
and
geek
jargon
this
is
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
and
is
worth
picking
up
when
you
see
it
i
got
mine
in
their
winter
classics
12pack
d
sadly
as
you
drink
this
beer
it
starts
to
deconstruct
itself
as
you
get
to
the
bottom
initially
very
tasty
but
at
the
end
is
not
what
you
originally
thought
pours
a
beautiful
dark
crimson
color
with
a
medium
brown
head
this
beer
is
clean
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
and
then
grows
bolder
after
that
first
taste
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
especially
with
a
handful
of
pretzel
sticks
the
only
bad
thing
about
this
beer
is
resisting
the
urge
to
chug
it
notes
what
a
great
winter
warmer
dam
this
beer
is
dam
tasty
i
only
wish
it
was
back
into
six
packs
if
only
seasonal
cheers
when
poured
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
has
a
dark
red
color
body
with
a
little
white
head
to
it
the
smell
is
malty
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
comes
through
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
spiciness
cinnamon
jumps
out
first
then
a
hint
of
ginger
come
through
this
beer
has
a
little
sweetness
to
it
but
malty
very
smooth
on
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
this
one
came
from
the
holidaywinter
variety
pack
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
not
much
of
a
head
or
lacing
ok
i
have
some
malt
and
spice
in
the
nose
the
nose
is
subtle
the
taste
is
much
livelier
some
caramel
malt
roasted
grain
some
dark
fruit
and
a
spice
note
thats
just
right
i
find
the
mouth
feel
to
be
smooth
with
ample
carbonation
as
to
not
be
cloying
the
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
i
couldnt
do
more
then
two
at
a
sitting
just
because
im
not
that
big
on
winter
warmers
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
drinkability
is
good
too
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
dnot
especially
exciting
but
not
bad
either
o
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
spicy
and
malty
perhaps
a
touch
too
sweet
but
besides
that
very
drinkable
a
solid
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
very
good
looking
brew
nothing
spectacular
flavor
wise
but
goes
down
easy
d
interesting
flavors
that
dont
build
on
the
palate
too
much
leads
to
easy
drinking
i
dont
think
id
want
multiple
bottles
of
this
but
it
makes
for
a
nice
winter
time
treat
a
pleasant
winter
warmer
and
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
offerings
sam
adams
puts
out
a
good
beer
that
i
hope
to
find
next
winter
preferably
on
a
snow
day
great
beer
and
much
better
than
the
winter
lager
imo
one
of
my
samuel
adams
favorite
which
is
found
in
their
holiday
variety
pack
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
dimpled
mug
poured
a
dark
brown
not
much
head
on
it
but
a
lively
carbonation
had
a
very
complex
aroma
with
cinnamon
really
standing
out
the
flavor
is
complex
with
roasty
notes
caramel
spice
fruit
a
little
sourness
and
low
on
hoppiness
a
fairly
interesting
beer
and
a
good
and
different
offering
from
sam
adams
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
o
i
like
this
although
i
cant
quite
tell
you
why
its
just
a
satisfying
winter
warmer
but
i
wish
there
were
more
spice
in
the
flavor
its
well
balanced
and
reminds
me
almost
of
a
moerlein
otr
toned
down
a
bit
i
feel
like
i
could
session
these
all
night
unfortunately
you
can
only
get
them
two
at
a
time
in
a
24
pack
good
stuff
i
do
look
forward
to
this
every
year
although
ive
missed
it
the
past
two
winters
now
that
ive
had
it
again
i
dont
think
ill
go
a
season
without
getting
some
d
the
drinkability
here
is
pretty
good
the
spices
are
on
the
lower
side
of
things
i
think
this
is
a
good
christmas
beer
also
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
out
of
the
sampler
pack
and
i
wish
it
were
available
in
6packs
good
bye
old
fezziwig
overall
what
a
balanced
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
sam
adams
makes
and
i
wish
it
came
in
six
packs
it
has
great
flavor
throughout
and
each
flavor
builds
on
the
next
dark
ruby
with
no
sediment
the
foam
is
white
and
settles
to
a
shape
resembling
that
of
a
hip
bone
it
smells
of
malt
and
somewhat
nutty
the
taste
has
some
nice
malts
but
is
very
earthy
and
has
few
spices
to
speak
of
its
earthy
to
the
point
you
almost
expect
to
find
some
dirt
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
finish
leaves
that
earthy
taste
on
the
tongue
its
ok
but
if
it
wasnt
in
the
winter
pack
i
wouldnt
get
too
many
of
them
d
due
to
the
lightness
you
can
knock
a
few
of
these
back
in
a
sitting
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
i
mean
its
more
like
a
very
introductory
winter
beer
but
i
see
winter
warmers
as
being
a
much
thicker
and
creamier
beer
rather
than
a
boston
lager
with
nutmeg
in
it
d
good
enough
but
lacking
some
element
to
make
it
great
and
exciting
d
i
always
look
forward
to
sams
winter
mix
so
that
i
can
get
a
couple
of
these
drinkability
is
good
and
enjoyable
brew
that
i
cant
believe
i
have
had
till
now
or
at
least
reviewed
good
drinkability
for
a
winter
warmer
but
nothing
amazing
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
winter
warmers
and
other
beers
with
a
spice
during
the
winter
months
solid
but
not
spectacular
compared
to
others
in
the
style
i
have
sampled
d
very
drinkable
nice
with
a
fire
and
some
crackers
and
cheese
nice
12
month
aged
sharp
new
york
cheddar
overall
not
bad
it
seemed
to
hold
its
own
quite
nicely
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
dthis
beer
has
excellent
drinkability
the
malts
play
the
lead
role
in
this
brew
and
who
doesnt
like
chocolate
and
caramel
my
current
favorite
of
the
sam
adams
holiday
pack
i
will
seek
this
out
again
the
spices
can
get
a
little
annoying
though
which
brings
down
the
drinkability
a
little
but
its
still
a
very
solid
brew
mouthfeel
a
medium
body
with
not
a
hint
bitterness
a
nicely
executed
winter
beer
pretty
robust
in
flavor
and
quite
tasty
drinkability
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
to
put
me
in
a
festive
holiday
spirit
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
its
a
good
recipe
theyve
got
here
and
one
of
the
more
notable
us
winter
warmers
touches
more
on
the
belgian
examples
than
most
poured
into
a
pint
glass
medium
white
head
with
low
carbonation
the
hue
is
a
deep
amber
and
hazy
the
aroma
is
slight
cinnamon
and
some
other
spice
the
taste
is
bland
at
best
nothing
jumps
out
onto
your
palate
the
body
is
medium
and
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
but
not
enough
there
to
keep
you
from
drinking
something
else
got
this
out
of
the
sam
adams
winter
mixed
case
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
poured
a
very
rich
brown
with
decent
head
retention
had
a
pleasant
sweet
smell
and
average
mouthfeel
very
smooth
with
extra
flavor
from
the
spice
great
session
beer
for
a
cold
night
as
i
downed
5
of
these
while
eating
oysters
and
watching
football
in
my
buddys
driveway
mediumtofull
bodied
brew
heavier
than
i
expected
the
flavor
is
somewhat
of
a
letdown
in
all
honesty
this
tastes
very
similar
to
one
of
the
others
in
the
mixed
pack
toffee
dark
fruits
alcohol
littletono
spice
presence
i
dont
know
this
was
my
most
anticipated
brew
in
the
pack
but
it
ended
up
being
my
least
favorite
boo
d
one
is
enough
for
after
dinner
or
to
sip
on
in
the
evening
not
an
every
day
drinker
for
me
deasy
drinking
and
not
too
spicy
i
dont
like
when
they
get
too
spicy
reasonable
malt
presence
and
easy
to
drink
sam
puts
out
some
classy
stuff
d
really
decent
beer
one
of
my
favorites
out
of
the
sampler
pack
i
also
grab
these
first
out
of
the
pack
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
wish
i
could
pull
out
more
of
the
flavors
in
the
taste
which
are
listed
on
the
beers
label
could
be
my
fault
could
be
the
brew
hard
to
say
goodtasting
though
not
terribly
complex
na
zdravje
d
not
bad
for
a
couple
but
the
spice
might
wear
on
your
palate
after
a
bit
d
yes
but
not
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
this
winter
classic
but
i
dont
have
to
try
anymore
the
rest
finish
is
lingering
with
toasted
malt
flavors
that
are
mildly
astringent
with
hints
of
orange
rind
body
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
very
good
quite
tasty
very
malty
right
off
the
bat
spicy
middle
chocolately
end
with
a
touch
of
hops
aftertaste
is
of
subtle
raisins
as
it
drys
to
a
clean
finish
highly
carbonated
which
i
cant
say
i
enjoy
very
much
and
wellbodied
its
decent
for
its
purpose
as
a
winter
warmer
but
i
cant
say
id
buy
a
six
pack
if
they
sold
them
its
a
great
choice
for
the
winter
classics
pack
but
to
me
its
just
not
a
standalone
type
of
beer
d
this
beer
isnt
as
good
as
i
remember
it
but
its
still
a
great
christmas
time
ale
nicely
spiced
its
perfect
for
those
cold
winter
nights
i
wish
sam
adams
would
release
this
in
a
6pk
instead
of
the
mixed
12
poured
into
perfect
pint
glass
that
created
perfect
fitting
pour
54
head
lasts
as
it
fades
to

well
coating
a
clear
dark
amber
brew
some
lacing
malty
aroma
of
specialty
and
roasted
malts
that
blend
with
a
presence
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
malt
flavor
scottish
style
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
the
added
spices
not
overwhelming
enjoyed
this
overall
and
liked
the
finish
which
slowly
faded
dry
lively
carbonation
seems
full
bodied
nice
winter
warmer
thats
not
overpowered
by
the
special
ingredients
good
mouthfeel
kinda
sticky
with
the
aftertaste
super
easy
to
drink
as
well
this
one
didnt
blow
me
away
but
i
think
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
as
a
well
above
average
beer
from
sam
adams
very
nice
christmas
ale
bob
cratchett
bottoms
up
dgood
drinkability
look
forward
to
this
one
in
the
annual
winter
package
maybe
i
have
an
oxidizedskunked
bottle
d
crisp
and
clean
tasting
aides
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
without
issue
not
a
mind
bender
by
any
means
but
still
enjoyable
this
medium
bodied
brew
is
a
very
friendly
yuletide
kinda
guy
and
i
like
him
you
probably
will
too
i
cant
imagine
the
holidays
without
this
one
always
look
to
enjoy
one
around
christmas
d
yes
ill
have
another
thankyou
you
really
should
make
this
your
first
beer
of
the
night
because
i
really
think
the
various
spice
flavors
could
get
lost
in
this
one
bottom
line
this
is
a
great
beer
from
samuel
adams
and
needs
to
be
on
everyones
list
d
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
nearly
as
impressed
with
this
beer
as
others
seem
to
be
not
one
of
the
best
spiced
beers
i
have
had
i
see
myself
only
having
one
of
these
tonight
i
find
the
winter
lager
very
similar
but
more
subduedfor
obvious
reasons
and
i
could
handle
more
of
those
than
this
ale
a
brew
that
works
great
for
a
winter
holiday
occasion
or
a
winter
day
in
general
heck
this
refreshing
brew
is
not
heavy
and
would
be
quite
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
verified
on
81611
and
in
may
2014
tasted
like
it
should
slightly
sweet
not
too
warming
actually
but
cold
and
sturdy
malt
forward
a
good
inclusion
into
the
winter
mixer
pack
10
99
at
safeway
and
plus
that
pack
includes
the
superior
chocolate
bock
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
without
any
problem
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
out
of
this
one
since
ive
read
all
of
the
good
things
said
about
it
its
a
good
holiday
ale
not
great
aftertaste
not
so
great
just
ok
conclusion
this
beer
didnt
entirely
work
for
me
it
was
a
little
forgettable
but
still
i
enjoyed
the
one
i
had
i
found
it
to
be
more
of
a
sipping
beer
for
some
reason
d
not
bad
though
this
style
is
definitely
not
a
favorite
of
mine
pretty
well
balanced
and
kept
in
check
for
the
most
part
medium
bodied
proper
carbonation
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sweet
aftertaste
i
am
really
glad
i
picked
this
up
and
will
look
for
it
again
in
the
winter
pack
or
as
a
single
d
pretty
nice
i
understand
why
people
like
this
inexpensive
and
wellexecuted
not
a
paradigmshifter
but
good
nonetheless
poured
into
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
dark
amber
with
a
thin
little
head
and
thin
lace
if
christmas
could
be
bottle
and
given
an
aroma
this
bee
would
encompass
that
entirely
dark
sweet
cherries
with
a
toffee
background
supported
by
a
deep
malty
profile
i
guess
i
would
say
the
smell
reminds
me
of
fruitcake
sweet
malty
flavor
with
dark
fruit
undertones
mostly
raisins
and
sweet
cherries
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
probably
along
the
lines
of
cloves
and
rainbow
peppercorn
finish
with
a
linger
caramel
flavor
the
body
is
full
and
the
flavor
lingers
with
a
kind
of
dry
finish
good
easy
drinking
on
this
with
great
flavor
wish
i
didnt
have
to
by
a
twelve
pack
to
get
a
few
bottles
though
notes
such
a
damn
good
beer
im
surprised
boston
beer
doesnt
make
this
widely
available
would
surely
be
a
popular
drink
at
any
holiday
party
overall
probably
on
of
bbcs
best
beers
lots
of
spice
and
thickness
to
this
beer
i
love
the
amount
of
caramel
used
i
tend
to
like
my
winter
warmers
a
bit
on
the
heavier
abv
side
but
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
for
the
wintertime

this
pours
a
deep
blood
red
with
a
nice
tight
head
with
some
lacing
on
the
nose
im
getting
some
cinnamon
and
floral
notes
but
like
some
other
sa
beers
the
nose
seems
distant
on
the
tongue
there
are
prominent
spice
notes
lots
of
citrus
and
underneath
a
roasted
malt
its
almost
like
a
chocolate
covered
orange
very
nice
in
the
mouth
its
fuzzy
but
not
fizzy
and
pretty
thin
overall
its
drinkable
but
maybe
a
bit
too
distinct
to
use
a
session
brew
and
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
a
bit
unsatisfying
in
quantity
d
drinks
good
for
a
holiday
ale
not
too
spicy
but
has
hints
of
candy
or
caramel
and
slight
cinnamon
back
there
good
solid

too
bad
there
is
only
2
in
the
sampler
agreed
that
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
in
the
sampler
d
for
a
spicy
holiday
ale
this
is
very
drinkable
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
chocolate
finish
dispel
any
notion
of
this
wellspiced
ale
being
a
solitary
affair
somewhat
bright
upfront
with
slick
sweetness
and
a
faint
dustiness
from
the
spice
a
little
more
full
body
would
have
added
to
an
otherwise
rather
desertlike
brew
enjoyable
and
drinkable
regardless
somewhat
more
roasty
than
i
remember
from
the
bottle
a
very
palatable
and
sessionable
rendition
of
the
style
i
remember
liking
this
beer
more
than
i
do
now
perhaps
because
it
used
to
be
one
of
the
only
standouts
in
the
winter
classics
12

that

has

goodbye

hello
chocolate
bock
holiday
porter
i
will
certainly
fezzi
credit
for
being
true
to
style
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
pleasant
treat
in
the
winter
variety
package
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
can
imagine
a
good
holiday
party
to
take
this
beer
to
and
enjoy
i
only
wish
sam
adams
would
have
experimented
more
and
added
to
the
complexity
nothing
really
stand
out
in
this
beer
other
than
it
being
a
good
allround
drink
very
refreshing
beer
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
solid
seasonal
6
pack
t
the
spices
are
in
the
forefront
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
dominate
the
flavor
profile
strong
malt
character
that
overwhelms
the
hops
orange
peel
adds
nicely
to
the
background
giv
d
minus
the
mouthfeel
that
is
a
bit
off
the
flavors
are
really
nice
and
that
alone
makes
the
beer
fairly
solid
it
stays
very
drinkable
especially
with
the
lighter
than
expected
body
but
there
could
be
some
more
thickness
there
d
okay
d
this
is
a
great
beer
while
its
not
sessionable
and
it
shouldnt
be
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
it
is
the
perfect
compliment
to
a
cold
winters
night
and
would
pair
great
with
white
meat
or
desert
sam
adams
continues
to
set
the
stage
for
american
brewers
im
honestly
not
too
hot
on
the
winter
warmer
style
but
this
is
pretty
good
kind
of
rich
to
be
a
regular
or
sessionable
brew
but
worth
a
try
or
two
the
mouthfeel
is
also
nice
with
a
medium
body
benefitting
from
ample
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
with
just
a
touch
of
lingering
sweetness
and
spice
this
is
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
i
just
wish
the
smell
was
more
appealing
something
i
would
actually
drink
again
from
sam
nice
one
this
is
a
good
beer
one
of
the
best
offerings
ive
tried
from
sam
adams
actually
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
of
my
friends
without
hesitation
overall
i
would
say
i
was
satisfied
with
this
brew
i
thought
it
was
really
well
balanced
the
ratio
of
malt
to
spices
was
pretty
good
this
was
my
second
favorite
out
of
the
winter
pack
with
the
chocolate
bock
taking
top
honors
i
would
say
this
brew
lived
up
to
its
hype
and
was
a
good
choice
for
this
cold
michigan
winter
night
i
hope
they
sell
this
in
six
packs
next
year
d
pretty
decent
but
not
mind
blowing
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
but
wouldnt
go
crazy
seeking
it
out
sam
adams
does
dark
beers
like
no
other
popular
brewery
can
amazing
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
and
worth
a
try
will
not
amaze
but
something
i
think
all
would
enjoy
a
nice
hiss
tells
me
this
baby
is
ready
to
take
the
bubble
fountain
down
to
my
duvel
tulip
deep
mahogany
liquid
fills
the
glass
topped
with
a
very
full
and
rich
light
beige
head
deep
amber
hues
in
the
light
quite
clear
there
are
thick
ribbons
of
lace
where
the
froth
adhered
leaving
a
decent
smattering
of
bubbles
everywhere
a
swirl
and
a
waft
brings
forth
a
beautiful
aroma
of
deeply
caramelized
sugar
a
warm
fruity
tone
reminiscent
of
raisins
and
prunes
and
a
brighter
nutty
tone
that
accompanies
holiday
spices
the
first
sip
of
fezziwig
for
the
season
brings
forth
a
nice
biscuity
flavor
that
transforms
into
a
cornucopia
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
black
currants
and
maybe
even
a
hint
of
pepper
the
second
sip
enunciates
these
characteristics
even
more
and
gives
rise
to
a
light
herbal
bitterness
that
appears
towards
the
end
of
the
experience
and
lasts
long
into
the
finish
accompanied
by
a
beautiful
balance
of
christmas
potpourri
spices
all
of
this
is
carried
by
a
full
bodied
velvety
brown
ale
with
exceptionally
smooth
carbonation
i
finally
see
the
light
this
beer
represents
christmas
by
sam
adams
the
first
day
that
this
winter
mixer
appears
on
the
shelves
is
the
first
day
of
the
holiday
season
this
beer
although
i
didnt
know
it
at
the
time
was
the
reason
i
bought
the
pack
drinkability
a
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
box
great
for
the
winter
oa
pretty
good
beer
actually
the
first
few
times
i
had
it
i
wasnt
a
fan
im
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
its
not
a
bad
small
beer
for
the
winter
it
might
do
well
being
sold
in
larger
quantities
definitely
one
of
the
best
in
the
winter
pack
i
definitely
like
the
winter
twist
on
it
d
less
than
pleasant
adjuncty
aftertase
brings
down
the
score
d
alright
i
cant
say
winter
warmers
are
the
best
for
drinkability
it
certainly
isnt
as
good
as
their
winter
lager
but
that
isnt
saying
too
much
thanks
sam
d
good
and
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
more
in
the
future

and
its
just
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
great
combination
of
flavors
when
i
get
a
christmas
brew
i
like
a
degree
of
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
the
holiday
season
and
this
has
just
that
it
perfectly
understated
also
the
winter
classics
this
year
is
vastly
improved
now
that
the
cranberry
lambic
and
coastal
wheat
have
been
replaced
so
this
is
much
easier
for
me
to
buy
and
bite
the
bullet
for
awesome
d
very
drinkable
for

this
is

favorites
from

neutral

plenty

it
warms
more
malt
aroma
particularly
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
breadiness
chocolate
malt
flavor
mixed
with
caramel
roasted
malt
comes
through
in
the
middle
and
hints
of
spice
linger
in
the
aftertaste
medium
body
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
a
real
shame
you
have
buy
10
lesser
beers
to
get
two
of
this
gem
d
i
can
now
see
why
everyone
always
wants
to
be
able
to
buy
this
one
in
6
packs
its
a
very
tasty
winter
warmer
unfortunately
i
cant
even
get
this
one
here
in
canada
unless
i
go
down
to
the
states
but
its
worth
it
overall
im
digging
this
sa
winter
pack
i
bought
id
love
to
leave
this
one
out
for
santa
with
the
cookies
the
aroma
is
dark
and
toasted
with
malt
coffee
toffee
and
hops
the
appearance
is
brown
with
a
foamy
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
toasted
malt
finish
the
palate
is
smooth
but
not
as
thick
as
it
should
be
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
but
has
some
flaws
in
the
aroma
d
this
has
been
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
ive
had
so
far
this
year
i
wish
this
was
more
readily
available
instead
of
the
holiday
sampler
pack
good
stuff
from
sam
adams
to
try
d
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
some
nice
spices
and
cinnamon
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
pretty
easy
going
down
would
have
again
d
very
balanced
and
wish
it
were
here
more
often
db
a
multidimensional
beer
without
a
big
hop
profile
spice
used
tastefully
and
malt
used
to
round
this
out
interesting
to
the
last
sip
md
medium
to
full
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
just
about
right
here
overall
much
easier
drinking
than
expected
like
this
one
a
lot
just
wish
it
came
in
six
packs
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
stamped
a305013483e
sampled
on
december
1
2010
the
pour
is
a
handsome
looking
brown
with
ruby
red
hues
and
regular
carbonation
the
aroma
has
a
good
supply
of
caramel
malts
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
or
all
spice
the
body
is
full
the
taste
also
brings
out
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
spices
with
a
fine
bitter
hop
ending
very
nice
all
told
drinkability
the
strong
spices
hinder

from

i
like
that
a

a
nice

winter
beer
from
boston
d

feel
in

good
beer
to
drink
when
the
weather
gets
a
bit
chilly
share
with
others
in
season
d
very
high
to
say
the
least
easily
my
favorite
from
the
whole
pack
d
an
excellent
holiday
beer
this
is
a
topnotch
reminder
of
why
we
should
still
love
sam
adams
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
they
dont
sell
it
in
6
packs
first
thing
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
pumpkin
beer
on
steroids
theres
that
nutmegspice
character
that
almost
every
pumpkin
beer
has
thats
quite
welcome
for
the
style
but
then
as
you
get
further
into
it
more
comes
out
i
do
notice
some
light
orange
thats
fresh
and
sweet
the
body
is
really
quite
perfect
its
thick
and
smooth
with
light
carbonation
that
makes
the
whole
experience
very
mellow
its
quite
an
easy
drinker
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
however
its
a
bit
sweet
and
spicy
for
me
to
want
to
drink
a
whole
lot
its
a
welcome
addition
to
the
winter
12pack
d
a
good
beer
and
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
samuel
adams
winter
pack
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
very
smooth
i
find
it
very
easy
to
put
down
especially
for
its
style
a
nice
offering
from
boston
beer
co
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
d
a
decent
brew
id
have
another
poured
from
bottle
into
trusty
old
shaker
glass
on
26
nov
10
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
that
disapated
pretty
fast
aroma
of
cinnamin
and
bready
malt
taste
was
malt
goodness
cinnamin
and
some
caramel
with
a
very
smooth
finish
this
is
a
very
good
winter
seasonal
that
i
wish
theyd
bottle
into
sixers
will
look
for
more
of
this
this
winter
this
beer
pours
a
veryy
dark
amber
color
amot
black
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
without
smelled
sweet
with
alot
cimmimon
has
a
smooth
sweet
complx
flavor
with
alot
of
cimmon
easy
to
drink
but
a
nice
sipping
beer
overall
a
really
nice
winter
beer
final
notes
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
its
delicious
beautifully
complex
sweet
and
spicy
flavor
would
pair
well
with
any
hearty
meal
or
dessert
and
has
enough
alcohol
warmth
to
keep
you
warm
out
of
the
winter
variety
pack
i
think
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
selections
but
at
the
same
time
it
only
takes
the
sam
adams
seasonal
recipe
lots
of
caramel
big
spices
low
bitterness
and
tweaks
it
some
while
boosting
other
characteristics
maybe
im
just
burnt
out
on
the
winter
pack
at
this
point
but
i
still
found
this
to
be
a
delicious
and
wonderful
beer
another
beer
i
tried
while
at
a
family
gathering
for
thanks
giving
was
sitting
in
the
cooler
and
bottle
had
some
wear
and
tear
so
i
dont
know
how
long
it
might
have
been
in
there
for
in
general
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
the
hopiness
and
overall
flavor
did
catch
me
by
surprise
although
it
felt
light
at
the
same
time
definetly
something
i
would
give
another
try
d
really
drinkable
low
abv
and
a
light
body
makes
it
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
winter
day
this
flavor
is
strong
interesting
and
impressive
a
superb
winter
beer
despite
the
joiedevivre
exhibited
by
old
fezziwig
this
is
a
better
beer
for
an
evening
of
relaxation
putting
your
feet
up
and
biding
your
time
before
being
visited
by
various
christmasthemed
spirits
pours
a
dark
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
light
tan
heard
head
is
big
and
fluffy
hangs
out
for
a
bit
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
as
it
goes
scent
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
subtle
spiciness
taste
is
lots
of
maltiness
up
front
with
some
subtle
roasty
and
spicy
notes
ginger
orange
peel
and
cinnamon
are
there
as
promised
on
the
label
but
much
more
subtle
than
i
expected
which
is
a
good
thing
just
by
looking
at
it
i
expected
a
big
beer
and
was
surprised
to
see
the
5
9
however
this
probably
makes
it
a
bit
more
of
a
drinkable
beer
overall
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
with
a
slightly
sticky
finish
a
good
beer
overall
especially
for
winter
drinkability
is
also
high
i
agree
with
the
sentiments
of
many
if
this
was
in
six
packs
itd
be
a
goto
winter
brew
for
sessions
a
bit
brisk
up
front
nicely
carbonated
and
almost
medium
in
body
this
brew
makes
a
decent
winter
beverage
drinkability
similar
to
the
idea
of
the
mouthfeel
above
the
beer
comes
forth
with
a
strong
aftertaste
that
doesnt
feel
very
appealing
drinkability
isnt
bad
i
just
dont
get
some
of
the
hype
for
this
beer
didnt
even
strike
me
as
a
winter
warmer
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
notched
for
mar
one
of
the
beers
from
the
winter
classics
mix
12
pack
pours
a
cloudy
deep
dark
brown
with
a
frothy
medium
sized
head
lots
of
lacing
aromas
of
roasted
malts
cinnamon
orange
peel
and
a
bit
more
spice
interesting
mix
of
scents
taste
isnt
as
inyourface
as
the
aroma
nice
malty
flavor
with
an
orange
peel
finish
flavors
of
spice
as
well
really
good
winter
warmer
drinkability
im
enjoying
this
one
a
good
bit
while
the
flavors
are
not
strong
they
are
definite
pleasant
and
distinguishable
ill
certainly
have
no
problems
with
having
more
of
this
one
that
said
if
i
could
buy
it
on
its
own
separate
from
the
variety
case
id
probably
give
it
a
pass
in
favor
of
some
of
the
other
winter
warmers
i
prefer
d
doesnt
really
come
through
on
the
alcohol
but
im
not
looking
for
it
easy
drinking
and
good
flavors
over
all
solid
offering
id
drink
it
again
and
even
suggest
it
to
others
d
this
was
a
good
tasting
beer
from
sam
adams
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
works
well
with
the
beer
i
wish
they
made
this
beer
year
around
or
at
least
by
the
6
pack
come
on
sam
adams
just
maybe
for
once
meh
not
recommended
but
if
you
really
like
spiced
winter
beers
its
likely
worth
a
shot
pours
a
deep
brownred
with
2
fingers
of
tannish
head
smells
are
caramel
malts
chocolate
malts
and
some
spices
tastes
are
sweet
malts
slight
apple
from
the
yeast
spices
and
a
slight
chocolate
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
slightly
sticky
on
the
lips
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
im
surprised
ive
never
had
it
before
i
do
think
that
2
in
a
12
pack
is
enough
at
least
for
me
as
it
seems
to
get
a
little
sweet
at
the
end
d
this
and
the
holiday
porter
are
the
standouts
of
the
winter
variety
pack
i
didnt
expect
to
like
this
nearly
as
much
as
i
did
d
exceptional
drinkability
with
good
use
of
the
spices
a
very
nice
good
drinking
winter
warmer
again
i
really
like
the
spices
in
this
one
yummy
d
very
drinkable
but
at
5
9
abv
not
a
session
beer
overall
i
like
it
but
it
is
a
beer
i
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
i
do
love
the
holiday
sampler
that
they
come
out
with
every
year
although
i
dont
love
them
all
i
like
all
of
themexcept
the
wit
that
one
sucks
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
body
is
rather
easy
drinking
im
not
really
in
the
mood
to
sip
on
it
and
in
a
way
id
somewhat
like
chug
this
just
to
try
a
different
beer
this
beer
to
me
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
and
even
though
i
am
pretty
new
to
the
beer
drinking
world
when
it
comes
to
this
style
i
am
sure
ill
end
up
finding
one
that
i
like
better
than
this
turns
out
that
after
nearly
a
year
in
the
cellar
old
fezz
is
better
than
fresh
perhaps
a
little
root
beeresque
but
well
integrated
smooth
balanced
i
try
to
be
very
objective
in
my
reviews
at
least
in
every
category
but
drinkability
i
even
try
to
avoid
the
firstperson
most
of
the
time
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
and
it
may
just
be
that
i
dont
really
like
spiced
beers
it
is
my
opinion
that
sam
adams
can
do
much
better
d
pretty
high
drinkability
very
refreshing
great
after
dinner
drink
drinkability
winter
spiced
beers
really
arent
my
thing
really
no
matter
how
well
i
may
rate
one
this
just
isnt
a
style
i
reach
for
that
being
said
this
one
isnt
bad
i
would
say
that
if
you
like
this
type
of
beer
give
it
a
try
if
not
dont
worry
about
it
youre
not
missing
too
much
cherrycolor
and
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
of
caramel
citrus
and
spice
malty
and
a
tart
fruit
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
cinnamon
the
spices
are
well
balanced
medium
body
one
of
sam
adams
better
ones
now
on
to
the
rest
of
the
up
graded
winter
pack
with
chocolate
bock
thank
you
sam
adams
too
strong
for
much
consecutive
drinking
but
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
occasion
get
this
try
it
and
lemme
know
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
red
hue
and
a
tan
head
head
is
strong
and
fluffy
but
doesnt
hold
long
smells
and
taste
are
good
but
somewhat
muted
and
its
difficult
to
pickup
individual
flavors
slight
taste
of
dark
fruit
gentle
spice
notes
and
caramel
medium
bodied
the
drink
goes
down
smoothly
highly
drinkable
winter
warmer
even
if
the
tastes
are
a
bit
muted
good
for
those
times
where
you
want
a
good
tasting
beer
you
dont
have
to
think
too
much
about
which
is
perfect
for
the
holidays
with
family
d
too
thin
for
the
style
with
a
little
more
body
this
would
stand
out
more
its
nothing
special
poured
aggressively
into
standard
nonic
color
is
deep
deep
redbrown
forms
a
spongy
2finger
head
that
shrinks
into
a
creamy
film
after
first
sip
average
lacing
this
is
another
one
of
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
lately
ive
been
drinking
high
abv
beers
this
one
is
5
9
and
have
been
trying
my
super
very
best
to
evaluate
these
lower
abv
beers
the
flavors
in
this
ale
are
so
mild
after
swirling
aroma
consists
of
slightly
toasted
malts
maybe
a
hint
of
smoke
and
caramel
i
can
hardly
taste
hops
but
havent
tasted
hops
before
in
a
winter
warmer
beer
sooo
i
just
wasted
a
perfectly
good
sentence
this
is
a
standard
malty
beer
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
still
on
the
light
side
but
matches
the
season
well
serving
type
bottle
to
mug
notes
from
the
2010
winter
pack
very
nice
winter
warmer
good
level
of
spice
and
malty
sweetness
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
it
could
just
be
a
bit
better
if
it
was
a
bit
fuller
good
balance
between
the
spice
and
malt
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
but
it
fell
just
a
little
short
for
being
great
as
it
is
it
is
really
good
notes
liked
this
one
a
lot
seems
to
have
a
mind
of
its
own
and
changes
like
a
chameleon
as
it
warms
very
solid
brew
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
sweet
malty
goodness
upon
pouring
this
appears
to
be
a
typical
winter
warmer
and
let
me
start
off
by
saying
that
ive
never
really
been
very
impressed
by
much
sam
adams
not
that
they
are
bad
by
any
means
just
not
my
idea
of
go
to
beers
this
beer
chamged
my
mind
a
little
bit
the
smell
is
only
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
and
gives
good
hint
of
the
flavors
that
you
are
about
to
enjoy
it
is
a
round
sweet
combination
of
cinnamon
and
roasted
malts
that
leaves
me
very
satisfied
due
to
the
nature
of
winter
beers
i
cannot
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
but
would
gladly
go
back
and
enjoy
any
other
time
were
it
only
for
the
fact
that
ive
got
to
buy
a
whole
damn
12pk
variety
to
get
them
ive
got
other
stuff
to
drink
after
having
taken
so
lon
to
actually
get
around
to
trying
it
id
have
to
agree
with
the
sentiment
of
putting
it
in
6pks
just
so
i
can
keep
a
couple
laying
around
pours
a
beautiful
mahogany
color
with
1
finger
of
tan
head
that
dwindles
down
fairly
fast
aroma
is
dominated
by
roasted
malts
and
dried
dark
fruits
raisins
prunes
dates
a
nice
sweet
caramel
toffee
flavor
initially
on
the
tongue
which
gives
way
to
the
aforementioned
dried
fruits
and
winter
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
stand
out
medium
bodied
smooth
with
light
carbonation
a
nice
beer
for
a
cold
evening
by
the
fireplace
worth
a
try
and
the
money
a
must
have
for
the
holidays
d
very
drinkable
perfect
for
a
cold
winters
night
very
good
winter
warmer
here
shares
some
characteristics
with
the
winter
lager
except
it
has
that
bitterness
on
the
back
and
is
a
bit
sweeter
as
well
if
i
dont
think
about
the
spices
that
i
was
hoping
for
its
a
very
nice
ale
that
i
could
enjoy
pretty
much
any
time
it
really
only
falls
down
in
expectations
related
to
the
style
final
thoughts
first
off
i
need
to
give
sam
adams
a
serious
two
thumbs
up
for
their
winter
favorites
mix
pack
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
some
time
and
i
dont
know
where
i
would
have
got
the
chance
to
try
it
otherwise
but
this
beer
was
one
of
my
top
favorite
from
the
mix
pack
overall
and
easiy
a
two
thumbs
up
beer
its
too
bad
it
only
comes
in
sets
of
two
with
the
winter
mix
12
pack
would
love
to
have
a
6pack
on
a
cold
winters
night
overall
all
the
points
here
are
excellent
with
the
notable
exception
of
the
watery
feel
i
wish
you
could
find
this
more
often
might
be
my
favorite
sam
adams
winter
beer
though
that
is
up
for
debate
mouthfeel
is
just
right
and
you
get
a
good
balance
out
of
it
drinkability
id
say
is
high
as
i
shared
some
with
three
people
that
arent
big
beer
drinkers
and
they
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
overall
a
great
ale
for
anyone
that
enjoys
a
nice
winter
feel
in
their
ale
d
smooth
nicely
carbonated
nice
sweetness
makes
this
go
down
fairly
easily
i
keep
wanting
another
sip
d
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
throw
back
and
seems
to
get
better
as
you
get
further
down
into
it
this
is
a
beer
i
would
definitely
consider
sessioning
given
the
right
occasion
such
as
a
holiday
party
or
new
years
eve
d
like
that
smooth
easy
drink
on
this
one
the
bready
malt
characteristics
make
is
heavy
enough
to
stand
up
with
some
winter
grub
vdubb
has
talked
this
one
up
for
a
good
while
now
simultaneously
drinking
up
all
that
he
can
get
thus
leaving
me
with
none
to
try
for
myself
now
its
my
box
so
ive
got
some
to
sample
it
pours
a
clear
dark
rubybrown
topped
by
a
short
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
anise
light
roasted
malts
figs
raisins
rye
bread
nutmeg
and
a
decent
amount
of
banana
the
taste
runs
similarly
with
the
rye
bread
taking
up
more
space
than
before
and
a
colalike
flavor
rising
up
as
well
the
body
is
a
lightfeeling
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
grainy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
not
spectacular
but
very
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
i
can
see
why
to
some
degree
anyway
that
people
wait
around
for
the
sa
winter
styles
pack
every
year
a
real
gem
from
bbc
d
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
kick
back
and
drink
several
in
a
night
too
bad
they
dont
put
more
than
2
of
these
in
the
mix
packs
it
came
in
a
sam
adams
sampler
i
got
this
week
now
fezziw
ig
is
added
to
oktoberfest
as
world
beaters
i
really
like
dark
beer
so
i
have
to
now
put
old
fezziwig
on
top
i
am
going
to
get
some
more
and
will
drink
it
with
filet
mignon
with
garlic
mushrooms
way
to
go
boston
overall
a
very
decent
winter
offering
sweet
tasty
and
not
thick
at
all
a
great
drinker
reminds
me
of
a
better
version
of
the
alaskan
amber
very
sessionable
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
carbonation
goes
down
super
smooth
i
didnt
get
any
spices
though
i
dont
know
why
this
would
qualify
as
a
winter
warmer
d
very
easy
to
drink
the
spices
pull
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
but
not
too
bad
its
not
too
heavy
nice
winter
to
beer
to
sip
by
the
fire
overall
this
is
a
decent
this
offering
from
sam
adams
the
winter
variety
pack
is
by
far
the
best
of
all
the
seasons
with
the
porter
and
the
new
chocolate
bock
addition
an
average
holiday
ale
because
of
its
spicy
flavor
one
of
my
favorite
craft
beers
of
all
time
i
love
me
some
good
malt
this
beer
pours
a
nice
mahogany
with
ruby
twinges
adorned
by
a
dirty
ecru
froth
the
smell
is
really
quite
pleasant
sweet
malt
aroma
is
allencompassing
but
there
is
a
distinct
orange
zest
aroma
that
is
meshed
nicely
with
the
ginger
and
cinnamon
its
rare
that
the
aroma
matches
the
description
on
the
bottle
so
directly
this
beer
tastes
just
as
it
smells
with
the
sugary
sweetness
that
would
be
expected
from
a
beer
as
malty
as
this
and
the
spices
match
up
nicely
the
flavor
of
steeped
oranges
is
a
bit
stronger
than
i
would
have
liked
but
i
still
really
enjoy
this
beer
this
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
and
smooth
perhaps
a
bit
undercarbonated
making
it
seem
slightly
too
viscous
but
its
well
above
the
threshold
of
dislike
this
is
a
really
nice
drinkable
beer
for
the
cold
weather
and
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
sam
adams
beers
d
very
high
why
this
isnt
put
out
in
six
packs
for
the
winter
is
beyond
me
beer
pours
out
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
tan
head
some
light
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
a
lot
like
ginger
almost
reminds
me
of
ginger
ale
some
faint
citrus
and
spice
from
the
cinnamon
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
unbalanced
from
the
ginger
spice
cannot
detect
any
deep
roasted
malts
or
any
malts
for
that
matter
fortunately
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
balanced
some
spritely
carbonation
on
the
tongue
followed
by
ginger
spice
and
some
citrus
and
light
hop
cleansing
but
the
hops
nor
the
malts
provide
much
flavor
profile
kinda
disappointing
taste
is
also
slightly
vinous
characteristic
of
the
darker
boston
beers
overall
i
cannot
drink
much
of
these
from
all
the
damn
ginger
and
i
am
confused
why
they
decided
to
make
the
winter
lager
which
has
exactly
the
same
spices
as
this
one
but
instead
of
an
ale
is
a
lager
but
from
memory
is
a
bit
more
balanced
but
hey
buy
the
winter
variety
pack
you
get
both
of
them
how
lucky
can
you
be
d
i
wish
this
was
in
6packs
yearround
i
dont
want
all
of
the
other
crap
in
the
winter
sampler
drinkability
i
would
not
mind
having
a
bigger
bottle
of
this
but
indeed
the
12oz
fits
nicely
into
my
tulip
and
does
remind
me
of
the
wonderful
beer
sipping
winter
season
of
rich
winter
warmers
russian
imperial
stouts
and
heavy
malted
beers
so
very
enjoyable
all
by
itself
and
i
think
i
could
pair
this
well
with
a
meal
if
i
had
a
chance
d
the
overabundance
of
spices
make
the
drinkability
in
this
beer
go
down
d
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
i
think
sipping
it
slowly
while
relaxing
in
front
of
a
fire
on
a
cold
winter
night
would
be
perfect
this
is
like
winter
lager
but
better
its
a
special
one
to
get
from
samuel
adams
a
lot
of
taste
for
not
that
high
of
an
alcohol
content
i
know
its
cliche
but
they
should
really
release
this
beer
as
their
winter
seasonal
beer
the
winter
lager
is
good
but
that
is
almost
like
the
lighter
safer
version
of
this
its
easy
to
drink
plus
has
a
full
flavor
taste
that
you
would
expect
out
of
a
high
end
craft
beer
really
nice
beer
overall
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
from
boston
brewing
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
and
goes
down
easily
a
really
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
colder
winter
night
d
a
nice
holiday
brew
that
doesnt
dissapoint
d
an
excellent
winter
warmer
probably
one
of
my
favorites
i
wish
that
sa
would
release
this
in
a
six
pack
of
its
own
surprises
you
with
the
first
taste
malty
earthy
mild
cinnamon
and
ginger
is
notable
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
aftertaste
and
after
a
few
more
minutes
its
sweet
and
caramel
sipper
good
winter
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
winter
warmer
and
one
of
sams
better
offerings
in
my
opinion
i
have
fond
memories
of
this
beer
over
the
years
and
it
has
stood
the
test
of
time
drinkability
although
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
isnt
something
i
want
to
drink
all
night
i
would
maybe
have
two
in
a
night
this
is
really
an
excellent
beer
that
could
work
at
almost
any
time
of
the
year
its
still
hot
outside
in
florida
and
im
enjoying
the
heck
out
of
this
worth
seeking
out
a
variety
pack
for
sure
for
this
im
glad
i
got
a
case
medium
to
full
bodied
this
beer
is
warm
and
has
nice
flavors
and
subtle
complexities
the
mouthfeel
is
great
thick
enough
to
be
a
porter
but
the
spices
supply
such
variety
to
the
palate
that
it
doesnt
weigh
you
down
at
all
a
great
wintertime
sipper
which
has
been
my
favorite
in
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
in
the
past
n
b
the
cranberry
lambic
is
dead
d
i
could
drink
this
any
day
of
the
year
the
spice
goes
with
many
occasions
in
my
opinion
very
full
bo
d
not
having
a
second
one
would
be
a
sin
honestly
sa
should
repackage
winter
lager
as
sa
bock
and
make
this
their
winter
seasonal
edit
apparently
i
was
on
page
2
lucky
me
its
too
bad
that
this
beer
is
exclusive
but
at
the
same
time
its
something
that
makes
you
look
forward
to
the
winter
time
excellent
brew
two
thumbs
up

final
thoughts
avoid
at
all
costs
and
buy
something
else
from
sa
or
a
different
winter
warmer
dark
russet
amber
with
a
creamy
sand
colored
head
that
leaves
some
blobs
of
fine
lace
on
the
glass
caramel
cubes
cinnamon
and
herbal
hop
aromas
orange
peel
and
cinnamon
spice
with
a
strong
caramel
malty
backbone
on
the
leaner
side
of
medium
bodied
and
slightly
sticky
with
fine
carbonation
this
beer
really
stands
the
test
of
time
i
have
had
this
beer
every
winter
for
about
ten
or
eleven
years
and
its
still
good
included
in
2010
winter
12
pack
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
big
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
light
chocolate
taste
is
very
light
and
full
of
flavor
tons
of
malt
flavors
with
cinnamon
a
bit
of
nutmeg
and
chocolate
a
bit
of
ginger
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
very
fullbodied
but
at
the
same
time
it
remains
light
and
extremely
drinkable
solid
beer
drinkabilty
pretty
good
with
this
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
i
dont
know
about
a
6er
but
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
cheers
d
well
its
something
different
from
them
i
guess
most
of
the
beers
just
seem
like
the
same
experience
still
it
is
pretty
drinkable
and
you
can
put
them
down
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
the
nose
brings
a
good
dose
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
some
other
wintry
spices
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
in
the
background
taste
brings
a
lot
of
spicing
and
some
malt
the
feel
is
medium
with
a
good
balance
of
spicing
and
roast
something
i
find
to
be
quite
rare
in
this
style
and
thus
worthy
of
a
fairly
high
rating
drinks
quite
well
and
is
a
nice
treat
during
the
holiday
season
o
there
is
just
enough
spice
going
on
here
for
a
good
aroma
and
taste
d
most
drinkable
winter
warmer
ive
had
in
a
while
but
then
again
its
august
in
texas
so
maybe
my
perspective
is
a
little
skewed
interesting
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
goblet
ruby
red
body
with
an
offwhite
head
about
one
finger
worth
smell
is
fruity
primarily
like
a
sweet
grape
or
raisin
with
significant
malts
taste
is
much
the
same
maybe
even
a
bit
sour
feel
is
nice
and
warming
with
pretty
medium
body
and
appropriate
carbonation
overall
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
d
one
was
enough
for
me
d
surprisingly
low
abv
and
therefore
very
drinkable
very
drinkable
and
a
solid
winter
brew
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
would
probably
move
on
to
something
else
eventually
malty
fruity
flavors
are
most
noticable
the
spices
are
not
nearly
as
present
in
the
taste
as
they
are
in
the
smell
i
am
able
to
detect
some
cinnamon
and
maybe
a
little
nutmeg
but
not
much
else
in
the
way
of
spices
i
actually
get
a
nice
hint
of
coffee
that
i
wasnt
expecting
medium
bodied
and
well
carbinated
almost
overcarbinated
easy
to
drink
and
well
crafted
d
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
right
next
to
the
bbc
cabin
fever
easily
drinkable
spices
are
not
overpowering
in
the
least
a
good
beer
for
celebrating
the
holiday
season
one
of
the
better
ones
from
the
boston
beer
company
md
smooth
and
relaxing
easy
to
drink
on
a
cold
night
pours
a
dark
reddishamber
color
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
with
cherry
vanilla
spices
and
cream
the
cherry
is
predominant
the
flavor
is
very
spicy
with
some
ginger
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
medium
body
decent
carb
a
little
bit
of
a
chalky
mouthfeel
but
not
too
bad
in
this
department
good
drinkability
as
well
but
i
prolly
wouldnt
session
this
2
or
3
would
be
enough
i
wouldnt
really
seek
this
out
again
unless
it
fell
into
my
lap
as
it
did
this
season
as
well
as
last
traded
with
a
friend
but
one
of
the
more
solid
offerings
from
sam
adams
drinkability
no
problem
getting
through
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
a
great
winter
warmer
from
a
solid
brewery
d
a
nice
holiday
seasonal
beer
balanced
and
complex
with
distinct
parts
but
without
being
put
together
pretty
good
but
not
a
session
beer
for
me
i
would
like
it
bigger
malty
more
body
something
more
for
sipping
pours
a
bright
amber
with
only
a
skim
of
a
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
is
strongly
licorice
and
winter
spice
and
as
the
beer
warms
more
and
more
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
tingly
and
medium
bodied
but
the
alcohol
seems
to
overtake
most
flavors
in
the
taste
which
is
hard
to
understand
since
it
is
only
5
9
finish
is
a
little
dry
and
nonmemorable
not
a
real
fan
of
this
one
i
love
the
appearance
on
this
one
it
pours
a
really
pretty
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
just
lasts
and
lasts
very
pretty
lol
the
smell
is
nice
it
has
a
hint
of
cinnamon
definitely
smells
holiday
tastes
nice
its
absolutely
a
holiday
brew
cinnamon
and
other
spices
with
a
bit
of
malt
flavor
feels
and
goes
down
good
all
in
all
its
a
very
nice
holiday
beer
hope
to
find
it
again
whoa
this
reminds
me
of
coke
and
holiday
cinnamon
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
a
woodsy
taste
cola
and
a
bit
of
cocoa
are
present
as
well
as
a
kind
of
bitter
cherry
flavor
the
cola
hits
me
last
in
the
profile
and
really
kind
of
makes
me
want
a
coke
which
is
weird
because
i
dont
really
drink
soda
anymore
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
flavor
is
nice
and
this
is
super
drinkable
a
holiday
session
old
fezziwig
is
a
pleasant
holiday
ale
the
spice
levels
are
just
right
and
never
overpower
my
only
complaint
is
that
id
like
to
see
a
little
fuller
body
and
more
depth
in
the
malt
character
d
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
offering
from
sam
adams
i
havent
seen
this
one
sitting
out
with
the
single
beers
lately
but
found
it
in
12
pack
of
winter
beers
this
was
beer
1
and
if
all
the
rest
suck
it
will
still
be
worth
it
good
winter
warmer
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
ive
had
it
seems
a
lot
of
brewers
are
afraid
to
make
malty
beers
due
to
the
hop
crazy
craft
beer
crowd
not
sa
nice
work
notes
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
for
a
while
and
finally
decided
to
buy
a
winter
pack
i
actually
ended
up
liking
the
holiday
porter
better
however
this
one
is
good
for
its
own
reasons
i
really
like
the
smell
of
this
one
if
the
taste
incorporated
just
a
little
more
distinction
between
flavors
like
the
aroma
does
it
would
be
amazing
d
very
good
goes
down
nice
lots
of
flavores
combine
well
in
this
one
drinkability
id
rather
not
it
goes
down
easy
but
so
does
water
this
isnt
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
dont
understand
the
hype
cheers
drinkability
if
they
halved
the
amount
of
spices
this
would
actually
be
a
decent
beer
reviewed
from
my
notes
served
at
diversions
aboard
the
disney
wonder
cruise
ship
somewhere
between
cape
canaveral
and
nassau
poured
from
a
cold
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
has
a
pretty
dark
copper
color
and
a
thin
head
it
has
a
great
spiced
aroma
like
a
christmas
dinner
it
has
an
interesting
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
it
has
a
body
that
falls
somewhere
between
medium
and
light
there
is
a
pleasing
amount
of
carbonation
its
very
drinkable
i
find
the
flavor
very
inviting
its
too
bad
this
beer
is
only
available
in
the
12
bottle
mix
packs
i
was
really
excited
to
find
it
being
served
at
this
cruise
ship
bar
very
enjoyable
holiday
brew
i
will
join
many
others
before
me
who
wish
to
see
this
is
a
six
pack
format
very
pleasant
flavors
and
goes
down
easy
notes
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
not
exciting
enough
to
warrant
purchasing
sam
adams
winter
variety
pack
simply
for
this
beer
as
some
do
i
could
have
done
without
the
orange
but
thats
personal
preference
for
me
eliminating
the
orange
flavor
would
elevate
this
beer
to
a
slightly
higher
standing
the
way
it
is
there
are
spiced
winter
warmers
id
chose
over
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
2
finger
head
that
left
decent
lacing
and
a
slight
cap
the
aroma
is
full
of
spice
cloves
cinnamon
pine
nuts
and
some
roasted
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
a
little
rough
with
some
higher
carbonation
than
needed
there
is
a
strong
vanilla
presence
throughout
as
far
as
a
winter
spice
brew
this
is
actually
good
as
not
too
sweet
and
has
a
decent
bitter
finish
to
balance
it
off
overall
not
a
bad
offering
from
sam
adams
it
really
reminded
me
of
the
honey
porter
a
nice
cheap
holiday
beer
pretty
drinkable
the
only
bad
part
is
that
it
only
comes
in
the
seasonal
12
pks
d
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warms
to
enjoy
a
very
nice
holiday
beer
but
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
d
like
i
said
before
im
loving
the
interplay
between
the
sweetness
and
bitter
smoke
has
a
nice
lingering
just
enough
to
get
you
through
to
the
next
sip
i
found
after
two
it
was
getting
more
sweet
and
less
smokey
though
while
i
wouldnt
have
issues
drinking
multiple
of
these
id
want
something
different
in
between
to
keep
the
flavors
fresh
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
it
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
good
enough
to
warrent
a
purchase
of
the
mediocre
sa
winter
mixer
take
out
the
coastal
wheat
too
summery
and
the
cranberry
lambic
too
fallspringy
and
more
of
the
other
selections
in
the
winter
sampler
the
spices
in
old
fezziwig
ale
are
subtle
which
is
a
good
thing
yet
its
festive
from
the
label
to
the
color
to
the
sweet
flavor
the
low
alcohol
content
and
drinkability
make
it
a
great
holiday
party
drink
i
would
love
to
see
the
boston
beer
company
make
this
more
readily
available
during
the
winter
and
not
package
it
with
some
of
the
far
lesser
beers
in
the
winter
sampler
the
last
beer
in
my
fridge
after
company
this
evening
this
is
a
great
nightcap
i
also
like
it
because
it
has
much
the
same
flavor
profile
that
i
look
for
in
a
strong
ale
without
so
much
alcohol
that
it
knocks
me
over
this
isnt
one
to
pick
up
if
youre
looking
for
a
dessert
beer
after
a
holiday
meal
but
it
certainly
works
if
you
want
a
good
winter
warmer
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
ginger
in
the
aroma
and
a
little
dark
malt
medium
bodied
cinnamon
and
ginger
in
the
flavor
some
malt
sweetness
and
a
little
dark
fruit
good
spiced
holiday
beer
but
one
at
a
time
is
plenty
not
as
fragrant
and
spicy
as
anchor
osa
which
might
be
good
for
some
people
this
beer
pours
out
a
nice
dark
reddish
brown
color
leaves
lace
on
the
glass
and
makes
a
good
head
it
carries
a
malty
caramel
aroma
that
also
hints
of
cinnamon
and
spice
when
tasting
alot
of
the
aroma
comes
through
as
the
beginning
of
the
beer
is
malty
and
spicy
and
the
finish
is
more
sweet
with
hints
of
orange
peel
ginger
and
cinnamon
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
worth
trying
over
the
holiday
season
i
think
my
dad
has
finally
seen
a
glimpse
of
the
light
variety
packs
of
sam
adams
i
dont
think
i
can
really
ask
much
more
of
him
dark
red
hue
with
a
slightly
offwhite
foam
this
beer
reminds
me
of
christmas
i
mean
even
if
it
wasnt
christmas
caramel
cinnamon
a
bit
of
ginger
on
the
nose
and
a
whiff
of
the
alcohol
in
there
too
smooth
lovely
caramel
chocolate
and
cinnamon
delivery
soft
finish
stays
sticky
almost
clingy
in
the
mouth
like
a
lemur
to
my
checkbook
drinkability
prety
good
i
enjoyed
it
its
a
good
winter
warmer
d
quite
good
not
too
heavy
a
nice
winter
warmer
that
is
wellsipped
on
a
cold
evening
spices
come
out
to
play
a
bit
more
on
the
tastebuds
but
the
beer
still
maintains
a
nice
toasty
and
caramel
malt
presence
ginger
and
cinnamon
seem
to
be
a
nice
beer
combination
but
i
can
do
without
the
orange
peel
in
a
darker
beer
style
like
this
especially
without
some
coriander
compliments
its
pretty
light
bodied
overall
and
an
easy
drinker
for
a
holiday
beer
one
of
bbcs
finer
offerings
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
wish
list
for
winter
releases
rather
mild
for
a
winter
warmer
but
i
actually
prefer
it
this
way
still
a
fullbodied
beer
but
a
bit
more
subdued
in
the
spice
and
alcohol
than
other
beers
of
this
style
wouldnt
mind
having
this
in
a
6pack
quite
enjoyable
nice
winter
warmer
revisit
12152012
yields
a
slightly
better
pour
as
for
head
retention
nose
is
more
subtle
and
flavor
doesnt
linger
sweetness
is
less
evident
leaving
it
a
tad
hollow
ts
dropped
5
d
goes
down
ok
but
dont
like
the
aftertaste
and
it
is
really
heavy
not
a
bad
thing
if
you
are
having
one
of
course
ok
so
this
is
a
very
good
winter
ale
i
would
buy
this
if
it
was
sold
on
its
own
d
going
down
rather
quickly
good
christmas
night
brew
d
very
drinkable
i
wait
all
year
for
the
seasonal
pack
to
have
a
couple
of
these
great
ale
f
semi
dry
a
little
bit
of
the
smokiness
still
roasted
malts
lingering
with
a
little
bitterness
its
a
good
beer
that
has
drinkability
id
have
a
few
of
these
in
front
of
a
fire
good
seasonal
brew
overall
a
very
solid
sam
adams
offering
i
couldnt
have
probably
more
than
one
or
two
though
because
i
really
found
it
to
be
too
sweet
for
me
to
session
d
a
nice
winter
warmer
and
definatly
a
sessionable
for
the
style
one
of
my
preferred
boston
beer
offerings
overall
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
havent
had
this
in
ages
and
can
kick
myself
now
as
to
why
ive
gone
so
many
years
without
revisiting
this
this
beer
might
just
be
the
reason
to
get
the
otherwise
mediocre
seasonal
12
pack
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
well
smell
is
malts
and
a
little
spicy
taste
is
winter
spices
ginger
orange
peel
fresh
bread
a
touch
of
caramel
christmas
sweets
a
pretty
nice
flavor
profile
but
the
spices
are
a
bit
over
the
top
mouthfeel
is
good
malty
but
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
a
little
alcohol
shines
through
drinkability
is
alright
a
little
too
heavy
for
me
personally
to
session
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
a
good
winter
beer
d
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
at
this
strength
its
one
of
the
few
sessionable
christmas
ales
drinkabilitymouthfeel
great
winter
warmer
easy
to
drink
but
carries
some
weight
to
it
i
wish
sam
adams
would
sell
this
in
6
packs
its
not
that
i
dont
enjoy
the
mix
pack
i
just
dont
want
to
buy
12
beers
to
get
2
that
i
really
enjoy
overall
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
beer
the
sam
adams
brewery
produces
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
well
balanced
with
a
lot
of
flavor
thats
a
perfect
companion
to
a
chilly
winter
night
its
really
too
bad
its
not
available
as
a
6pack
because
id
definitely
be
returning
to
it
more
often
d
delicious
but
id
only
recommend
drinking
one
in
a
row
this
beer
is
mild
starting
out
but
halfway
through
the
glass
the
aftertaste
starts
to
get
a
bit
more
powerful
and
may
become
a
bit
cloying
after
two
glasses
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
though
this
is
one
of
the
more
remarkable
beers
from
the
samuel
adams
winter
sampler
i
plan
to
save
the
second
bottle
from
the
six
pack
for
a
rough
winter
day
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
worth
a
revisit
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
this
beer
produces
a
great
foamy
head
with
decent
amounts
of
lacing
and
glass
retention
its
a
hearty
amberorangy
color
with
excellent
clarity
to
it
the
smell
is
dominated
by
malts
in
my
opinion
the
rest
isnt
very
strong
the
remainder
of
the
smell
consists
of
christmas
spices
and
dried
fruit
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
better
along
the
same
lines
as
the
smell
its
very
sweet
caramelized
malts
id
actually
probably
like
to
give
it
a
3
75
on
the
taste
its
good
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
lighter
bodied
than
id
expect
out
of
a
winter
warmer
but
still
good
very
very
drinkable
dark
copperbloody
in
body
with
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
of
cherries
dark
fruit
spices
cinnamon
and
oddly
brownies
cherry
pie
dark
fruits
cinnamon
caramel
figs
molasses
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
i
have
had
in
a
while
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
white
head
on
a
dark
copper
body
nice
lacing
maltyspiced
aroma
hints
of
chocolate
and
cinnamon
very
smooth
to
drink
reminds
me
of
a
chocolate
chip
christmas
cookie
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
brews
wish
this
was
offered
in
6packs
d
this
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
ive
never
had
this
beer
before
and
was
quite
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
winter
pack
probably
my
favorite
member
of
the
winter
pack
now
that
the
cream
stout
is
gone
and
im
not
a
big
winter
warmer
fan
generally
though
many
have
said
it
previously
it
sure
would
be
nice
to
have
a
couple
more
of
these
rather
than
the
cranberry
lambic
nice
chestnut
color
about
a
finger
thickness
of
head
and
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
pleasant
but
somehow
does
not
match
flavor
the
flavor
is
bolder
than
smell
with
no
nasty
aftertaste
great
body
and
mouthfeel
this
brew
is
pretty
good
but
somehow
you
know
it
could
be
even
better
seems
to
be
lacking
something
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
what
this
fits
the
bill
as
a
winter
warmer
definitely
gives
you
a
warm
tingly
feeling
on
a
cold
winter
day
overall
it
was
a
step
up
from
the
cranberry
lambic
which
is
a
big
step
this
is
a
decent
christmas
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
one
in
the
future
reddish
brown
sort
of
rubyesque
really
not
much
haad
at
all
smells
of
cherry
cough
syrup
and
wood
tastes
of
dry
pleasant
maltiness
and
nuttiness
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
pleasantly
carbonated
drinkability
is
excellent
it
goes
down
like
a
drunk
sorority
chick
on
a
well
lets
just
say
it
goes
down
easy
tastes
this
was
my
first
winter
warmer
that
i
had
ever
had
back
before
i
even
knew
what
a
winter
warmer
is
a
spicy
beer
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
followed
by
some
sweet
malt
which
is
well
balanced
with
hops
full
of
flavor
and
waiting
to
be
discovered
by
your
taste
buds
cheers
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
although
i
dont
know
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
because
its
so
sweet
i
poured
this
beer
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
at
55
degrees
it
presents
as
amber
with
a
respectable
head
stand
of
fluffy
tight
bubbles
off
white
the
aroma
is
malt
forward
with
dark
fruit
subtle
alcohols
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
the
ginger
peeking
thru
no
hop
aroma
in
flavor
it
is
malt
forward
again
with
some
slight
dark
fruit
and
toasty
caramel
with
what
appears
to
be
a
dark
malt
addition
that
helps
to
dry
this
beer
in
the
same
way
that
roasted
barley
helps
to
dry
a
scottish
ale
there
is
a
lowmoderate
and
balancing
bitterness
that
keeps
this
beer
drinkable
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wish
was
dialed
up
just
a
bit
in
strength
my
bottle
calls
a
5
9
abv
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
just
a
touch
bigger
and
richer
overall
though
very
nice
smell
is
clean
and
a
little
sweet
with
lots
of
fresh
spice
scents
vanilla
chocolate
brown
sugar
cinnamon
clove
and
ginger
are
the
individual
spices
i
can
pick
out
taste
is
brown
sugar
with
a
trace
of
bitterness
vanilla
and
ginger
in
the
first
taste
fair
flavor
of
chocolate
in
this
and
a
good
amount
of
christmas
spices
mostly
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
chocolate
vanilla
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
a
woody
dry
bitter
finish
a
tasty
pleasant
winter
beer
here
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tongue
prickle
here
i
cant
tell
if
it
is
the
ginger
or
the
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
very
fine
carbonation
gives
this
a
creamy
mouthfeel
d
a
good
christmas
ale
that
is
mellow
in
flavor
but
festive
enough
a
few
of
these
definitely
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
drinkability
reminds
me
of
an
irish
red
ale
that
has
been
spiced
like
crazy
drinkable
but
a
little
outofwhack
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
large
head
my
intial
taste
surprised
me
with
the
spices
the
feel
was
very
smooth
almost
creamy
the
chocolate
malts
stood
out
to
me
because
it
seemed
to
have
just
the
right
balance
i
think
that
this
beer
has
a
good
chance
of
a
repeat
with
me
enjoyable
rb
kind
of
bland
nothing
bad
at
all
good
for
the
holiday
parties
but
not
one
of
their
better
beers
this
is
an
interesting
beer
a
good
example
of
a
winter
warmer
but
it
didnt
win
me
over
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
trying
it
again
pours
a
beautiful
deep
and
true
garnet
first
whiff
is
ginger
and
malt
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
mildy
deep
yet
smooth
malt
then
blends
into
a
nice
kick
of
ginger
and
a
good
bit
of
citrus
twist
at
the
end
quite
enjoyable
the
orange
shows
at
the
very
end
as
a
feeling
within
the
mouth
more
than
the
oj
taste
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
drinking
a
few
of
these
the
lace
is
remarkable
turning
into
a
microlace
after
a
few
minutes
coating
the
glass
like
a
miniature
frothy
tide
pretty
cool
drinkability
is
low
gimmicky
but
i
enjoyed
it
really
i
just
dont
understand
how
sam
adams
can
pair
this
and
the
honey
porter
against
the
lowly
coastal
wheat
and
cranberry
lambic
these
make
the
12pack
worth
it
in
my
opinion
d
extremly
drinkable
but
filling
this
beer
is
the
holiday
season
in
a
glass
i
poured
mr
fezziwig
in
my
samuel
smith
liter
glass
and
couldnt
ignore
the
spicy
smell
and
bubbly
body
of
the
beer
although
this
beer
smells
and
looks
great
it
taste
really
good
too
the
only
bad
thing
i
have
to
say
is
that
i
cant
drink
to
many
in
a
row
due
to
its
a
bit
sweeter
then
i
am
used
to
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
left
a
12
of
tan
bubbly
head
leaves
behind
some
lacing
the
color
is
a
dark
saplike
amber
smells
like
sweet
apples
and
malt
tastes
caramely
with
toffee
and
some
cinnamon
there
is
somewhat
of
a
light
biscuit
quality
to
this
mild
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
it
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
after
a
hop
bomb
medium
off
white
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
it
has
a
pure
mahogany
color
the
smell
is
strong
of
roasted
malt
carmel
malt
orange
nutmeg
and
other
spices
the
taste
hit
the
same
with
a
strong
citrus
that
comes
from
the
orange
the
taste
is
a
little
lacking
it
could
be
more
full
flavored
but
its
still
solid
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
so
is
the
drinkability
not
a
horrible
beer
by
any
means
but
i
do
not
feel
the
need
to
drink
it
again
the
beer
is
certainly
enjoyable
and
i
could
see
having
a
couple
for
dessert
but
id
definitely
mix
it
up
over
the
course
of
an
evening
on
the
upside
it
burps
extremely
well
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
slightly
carbonated
tingle
in
the
sinuses
its
hard
to
get
over
the
fact
that
its
not
an
ipa
just
enough
sweet
to
balance
the
bitter
spices
just
enough
bitter
to
let
you
know
its
a
beer
also
just
enough
alcohol
to
let
you
know
its
a
beer
cant
wait
for
the
next
overall
im
still
not
terribly
impressed
even
if
it
seems
to
have
improved
a
little
bit
i
still
dont
quite
understand
why
this
beer
is
so
beloved
to
each
his
own
i
suppose
i
would
give
this
a
try
because
getting
the
sam
adams
seasonal
pack
is
always
fun
for
some
reason
happy
holidays
d
no
complaints
here
this
is
one
of
sas
better
beers
imo
i
wish
they
sold
it
in
six
packs
d
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
winter
warmers
but
if
samuel
adams
attempt
is
any
indication
of
the
style
this
is
a
group
of
beers
that
i
need
to
become
quickly
acquainted
with
overall
a
very
well
put
together
holiday
ale
this
would
be
a
great
addtion
to
any
christmas
get
together
session
beer
for
you
and
grandama
its
easily
my
favorite
dark
beer
i
almost
feel
incorrect
in
calling
it
a
dark
beer
though
it
has
that
consistency
and
mouthfeel
and
one
of
my
510
favorite
beers
ive
ever
had
great
atmosphere
really
solid
appearance
terrific
nose
the
flavor
is
really
malty
and
robust
great
combination
of
spice
components
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
from
in
winter
12
pk
sampler
d
overall
this
is
a
very
good
crowd
pleaser
definitely
caseworthy
very
drinkable
very
good
winter
warmer
this
beer
is
a
very
refreshing
and
sweetly
spiced
beer
definitely
a
holiday
beer
that
you
have
after
youve
shoveled
the
driveway
or
something
to
just
enjoy
with
a
good
book
i
would
highly
recommend
it
again
very
enjoyable
as
i
cap
off
the
set
of
reviews
for
the
winter
pack
this
is
probably
my
favorite
with
the
porter
coming
close
i
liked
five
of
six
so
it
probably
will
be
a
repeat
buy
before
the
season
is
out
i
might
have
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
if
it
was
beefed
up
a
bit
to
compete
with
great
lakes
christmas
ale
the
clear
winner
in
my
mind
not
a
beer
for
long
sessioning
but
certainly
one
to
have
again
the
malt
is
very
noticeable
from
the
first
opening
but
overall
the
sweet
character
is
enjoyable
the
gingercinnamon
finishes
smoothly
contributing
to
its
citrus
notes
honestly
the
citrus
taste
is
subtle
though
at
first
difficult
to
note
in
my
opinion
the
appearance
has
a
rich
dark
color
that
i
enjoy
overall
a
good
christmas
beer
salud
pours
dark
amber
with
rocky
head
that
retains
well
at
first
and
recedes
to
a
nice
thin
lace
nose
has
a
nutty
quality
as
well
as
maybe
holiday
spice
cookies
on
the
palate
theres
a
balanced
expose
of
caramel
roasty
flavors
and
some
ginger
to
sweeten
things
medium
to
light
bodied
ale
and
very
easy
drinking
d
really
easy
drinking
considering
the
spiced
quality
of
this
beer
ive
had
a
few
winter
warmers
before
and
this
one
straddles
the
line
nicely
between
being
under
and
overspiced
good
beer
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
a
6
pack
of
it
but
a
welcome
addition
to
the
winter
mixpack
overall
actually
quite
good
better
than
expected
a
very
good
winter
warmer
this
should
be
offered
in
6er
form
i
really
like
this
brew
very
complex
and
flavorful
i
would
definetly
suggest
this
one
over
sam
adams
winter
lager
sure
to
warm
the
spirits
of
beer
lovers
as
well
as
any
winter
warmer
can
i
can
understand
now
how
so
many
people
could
look
forward
to
thibeer
every
year
as
a
harbinger
of
the
holidays
it
is
comforting
and
warming
and
i
agree
it
should
be
available
in
six
packs
at
least
along
with
the
holiday
porter
if
i
can
cast
my
vote
for
separate
sixes
here
taste
ginger
is
the
first
and
most
profound
flavor
i
experience
finishes
with
some
orange
and
chocolate
malt
drinkability
for
a
spiced
holiday
ale
extremely
so
i
am
sitting
here
trying
not
to
quaffe
this
down
reminding
myself
i
only
get
two
in
the
holiday
twelve
pack
i
could
easily
session
this
beer
and
not
get
sick
of
the
spices
as
stated
it
is
not
overly
sweet
the
spices
balance
it
well
i
wish
they
made
six
packs
of
these
during
the
holidays
because
i
would
grab
a
couple
and
sit
up
next
to
the
fire
with
friends
and
family
and
just
enjoy
life
cheers
overall
perfect
for
the
holiday
season
it
really
fits
the
bill
i
would
prefer
the
brew
as
a
whole
if
it
were
more
forcefulbolder
but
it
is
still
the
taste
of
the
season
pass
the
cookies
a
good
winterwarmer
offering
unique
and
true
to
form
rather
than
being
a
lesser
knockoff
of
better
takes
on
the
style
pours
a
thick
and
dark
redbrown
with
little
head
at
all
maybe
a
finger
of
head
off
of
a
not
very
gentle
pour
the
aroma
is
a
variety
of
differnet
malts
with
a
very
slight
spicy
scent
that
i
couldnt
identufy
the
taste
is
thick
and
malty
much
more
complicated
than
the
smell
light
and
slightly
plain
for
a
winter
warmer
this
has
loads
more
flavor
than
the
usual
sam
adams
flavors
the
thick
taste
coats
the
tongue
and
prevents
quick
drinking
but
the
taste
is
good
and
compared
to
many
winter
warmers
ive
had
5
6
is
sessionable
i
wish
it
came
in
its
own
six
pack
because
its
a
pain
to
have
it
packaged
with
other
stuff
i
dont
reall
like
id
say
that
this
beer
is
a
really
nice
example
of
a
winter
warmer
and
id
definitely
drink
again
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
a
6pack
form
cant
wait
to
enjoy
the
next
one
from
the
winter
collection
pack
d
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
here
i
would
gladly
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
winter
evening
d
a
great
winter
beer
for
sure
malty
sweet
with
nostalgic
xmas
flavors
my
only
complaint
is
how
full
one
of
these
makes
you
feel
good
drinkability
well
balanced
and
tasty
drinkability
another
damn
good
one
from
sam
adams
d
very
solid
choice
an
excellent
seasonal
beer
and
one
of
the
only
things
i
enjoy
about
the
winter
season
would
pair
great
with
thanksgiving
christmas
dinners
as
well
as
being
an
excellent
everyday
choice
i
wish
the
old
fezziwig
were
more
easily
available6packs
please
drinkability
solid
sessionable
beer
i
would
have
again
too
bad
its
not
offered
in
6
packs
somewhat
hearty
but
no
lingering
on
the
palate
will
drink
selveral
during
the
next
cold
snap
this
beer
and
the
holiday
porter
by
sa
are
really
great
winter
beers
drinkability
a
great
beer
and
my
favorite
part
of
the
sa
winter
pack
the
winter
pack
is
worth
picking
up
for
this
beer
alone
it
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
off
white
head
head
lingers
for
a
little
bit
and
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
caramel
malts
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
small
hint
of
citrus
front
of
the
sip
has
a
strong
malt
presence
with
small
hop
notes
end
of
the
sip
has
some
spice
mainly
noticed
in
the
ginger
aftertaste
overall
a
solid
beer
cant
say
anything
bad
about
the
beer
definitely
different
from
a
few
other
winter
warmers
i
have
had
this
fall
i
think
the
strong
ginger
presence
it
what
differentiates
itself
much
much
better
than
the
cranberry
lambic
i
started
with
from
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
overall
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
but
nothing
special
either
i
like
the
name
and
the
label
artwork
as
im
a
big
fan
of
a
christmas
carol
but
i
probably
wouldnt
search
this
one
again
overall
a
nicely
done
ale
fit
for
the
holiday
season
with
this
time
of
year
bringing
colder
weather
good
cheer
and
flavorful
foods
ill
be
stocking
this
in
my
fridge
for
sure
come
closer
to
the
holidays
cheers
d
an
enjoyable
beer
for
the
holidays
however
like
most
spiced
beers
one
or
two
at
a
time
is
enough
really
not
too
high
drinkability
in
amount
but
a
couple
or
few
are
very
drinkable
drinakability
is
great
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
with
a
little
bit
of
a
warming
bite
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
look
forward
to
many
more
quite
a
flavorful
brew
drinkability
is
great
the
should
make
12
packs
of
this
alone
by
far
the
one
of
if
not
the
best
in
the
winter
12
if
youve
never
had
this
beer
get
the
mix
pack
it
is
the
only
place
youll
find
it
there
is
a
good
reason
why
people
have
been
begging
for
this
to
go
in
sixers
great
beer
and
im
not
ashamed
to
say
how
biased
i
am
about
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
spices
taste
of
spices
and
cinnamon
and
some
malts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
not
really
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
selection
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
all
of
the
spices
seem
to
really
come
through
and
there
is
just
nothing
else
that
i
would
rather
have
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
think
that
this
is
by
far
in
the
top
3
of
the
sam
adams
brews
and
they
should
bring
it
back
in
6
packs
has
a
sweet
taste
and
is
a
darker
ale
smells
like
candy
beer
or
my
fathers
rum
cookies
not
really
very
drinkable
flavors
need
to
warm
up
and
be
sipped
slowly
if
this
were
fresh
i
would
be
really
disappointed
its
not
and
i
can
see
this
working
really
well
as
a
winter
warmer
the
spices
and
malts
are
soothing
and
do
remind
one
of
winter
even
in
winter
i
think
this
one
would
only
be
good
one
or
two
at
a
time
pours
mahogany
in
color
lots
of
clarity
and
a
finger
of
off
white
head
that
refuses
to
fade
scent
is
malty
and
nutty
holiday
spice
is
apparent
along
with
some
tanginess
the
ginger
seems
overdone
in
the
flavor
with
cinnamon
sitting
more
subtly
in
the
background
i
can
also
taste
caramel
banana
and
a
little
licorice
with
bitterness
coming
in
at
the
end
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
body
medium
with
the
surplus
of
spices
in
this
one
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
a
little
tiring
dnice
well
balanced
holiday
beer
without
the
overpowering
spices
that
can
trouble
beers
of
this
style
fired
her
open
and
poured
into
a
pint
color
was
a
dark
amberish
brownred
with
1
finger
slightly
tanned
head
that
receeded
slowly
to
a
thin
lacing
took
a
whiff
as
quickly
as
i
could
burst
off
the
cap
and
got
a
bit
of
yeast
aroma
that
yeast
scent
quickly
went
away
and
out
came
a
sweet
malt
smell
you
can
barely
make
out
some
trace
amounts
of
aroma
hops
as
well
take
a
deep
gulp
and
you
get
a
great
crisp
beer
with
what
i
think
is
some
cinnamon
or
other
form
of
spice
ever
so
slightly
bitter
but
sweet
as
well
some
traces
of
toffee
or
caramel
is
also
present
this
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
has
more
going
on
than
i
intially
thought
it
would
drinks
very
well
the
caramel
definitely
makes
it
a
drinkable
warmer
notes
overall
a
very
solid
holiday
beer
from
sam
adams
and
one
of
my
favorites
in
there
holiday
mixed
pack
to
me
it
is
not
a
great
winter
warmer
but
it
is
a
christmas
beer
not
a
bad
little
brew
from
sam
finishing
off
my
sam
adams
holiday
pack
not
a
huge
fan
of
spiced
beers
so
didnt
expect
much
from
this
one
looks
nice
has
a
dark
almost
gingerbread
like
color
smell
flavor
are
similar
to
christmas
cookies
spices
which
while
nice
doesnt
strike
my
fancy
this
beer
is
heavily
carbonated
making
it
almost
feel
like
soda
going
down
i
can
drink
this
but
having
a
hard
time
with
it
not
something
id
ever
seek
out
not
recommended
d
i
remember
one
night
i
had
four
leinenkugels
nut
brown
yes
i
know
its
a
different
style
that
i
bought
when
i
was
hard
on
cash
im
doing
my
best
to
recode
that
memory
with
this
there
instead
probably
less
of
a
headache
the
next
day
too
mouthfeel
is
between
thin
and
medium
this
is
by
far
the
best
seasonal
that
sam
adams
makes
its
big
and
malty
sweet
and
flavorful
i
would
almost
go
as
far
as
saying
that
it
should
be
mandatory
coldweather
drinking
an
excellent
beer
from
start
to
finish
this
ale
reminds
me
of
the
holidays
one
smell
of
the
spices
and
aroma
makes
me
think
of
winter
football
and
the
family
gathered
around
for
a
big
dinner
lots
of
flavor
and
great
character
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
spiced
ales
pours
from
the
bottle
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
about
a
quarter
inch
of
head
the
nose
is
a
little
spicy
with
some
muted
maltiness
but
not
much
to
write
home
about
sipping
i
taste
chocolate
malt
a
sort
of
lactic
flavor
and
quite
a
bit
of
spicy
ginger
the
beer
is
mediumbodied
and
leaves
the
mouth
tingling
a
bit
on
the
whole
a
nice
holiday
beer
though
i
feel
the
first
one
from
the
pack
which
i
drank
a
few
months
ago
was
quite
a
bit
better
i
can
see
why
this
is
called
a
winter
warmer
because
it
seems
like
something
i
would
want
to
drink
during
a
cold
night
by
a
fire
tasty
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
buy
the
whole
case
i
had
to
buy
of
winter
beers
to
get
it
out
of
a
mixed
winter
pack
this
beer
was
a
dark
garnet
color
the
two
fingers
of
beige
head
displayed
decent
retention
and
laced
at
first
in
curtains
then
remained
above
average
throughout
the
rest
of
the
sample
the
aroma
was
excellent
i
distinctly
detected
gingerbread
lots
of
spices
notably
allspice
and
nutmeg
orange
and
sweet
malts
the
flavors
were
also
onpoint
for
the
winter
warmer
style
and
quite
enjoyable
i
tasted
orange
peel
first
lots
of
gingerbread
again
caramel
malt
chocolate
malt
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
as
it
warmed
i
began
to
taste
the
alcohol
and
the
finish
was
nice
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
just
a
little
high
for
my
preference
overall
i
though
this
was
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
beers
this
prolific
company
makes
the
aroma
is
citrusy
the
orange
peel
and
other
citrus
aromas
really
come
through
the
taste
is
also
very
citrusy
the
orange
and
cinnomon
flavors
come
through
it
taste
pretty
complex
the
appearance
is
an
off
color
like
orangish
color
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
you
could
enjoy
multiple
drinkings
at
one
time
pours
a
dark
brownreddish
colored
body
with
some
head
tan
in
color
but
small
has
a
very
sweet
malty
aroma
slight
alcoholy
taste
some
spices
taste
malts
mellow
sweet
taste
watery
almost
porterish
tasty
avererage
beer
d
a
very
interesting
beer
as
it
warms
up
it
is
not
as
heavy
as
some
winter
warmers
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
i
dont
think
i
would
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
a
great
way
to
end
the
night
recommended
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
i
would
drink
this
all
night
but
they
only
gave
me
2
in
the
winter
pack
its
too
bad
you
cant
buy
a
sixer
of
these
because
it
really
is
one
of
the
best
offerings
on
the
sa
label
d
very
drinkable
a
session
beer
for
a
night
at
home
by
the
fire
an
absolutely
wonderful
winter
ale
and
another
top
notch
offering
from
boston
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
poured
a
about
a
one
inch
foamy
off
white
head
color
is
a
dark
red
burnt
color
with
mild
carbination
the
smell
has
a
nice
malty
spicy
attractivness
to
it
with
no
hint
of
hops
taste
has
a
alright
malt
base
nothing
really
stood
out
to
it
nice
bit
of
spicyness
with
a
taste
a
bit
of
cinnimon
to
it
but
thats
about
it
finishes
with
a
clean
aftertaste
mouth
feel
is
nice
not
real
light
but
smooth
overall
a
decent
beer
from
sam
adams
too
bad
can
only
get
this
in
the
holidays
i
would
recommend
this
beer
during
the
colder
months
it
leaves
you
a
bit
warmer
than
when
you
started
cheers
and
hoppy
holidays
i
could
have
these
all
night
dgreat
drinkability
but
short
of
session
brew
it
gets
a
little
stodgy
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
very
drinkable
a
good
offering
from
sam
adams
not
an
exceptional
winer
warmer
i
like
the
new
belgium
2
degree
below
a
little
better
but
something
i
look
forward
to
having
again
pretty
soon
d
the
boston
beer
co
has
done
a
great
job
with
this
one
a
very
tasty
and
somewhat
complex
under6
beer
something
we
need
more
of
d
i
miss
the
days
when
this
was
available
in
big
bottles
now
it
is
why
i
get
the
winter
collection
mix
pack
it
beats
the
dickens
out
of
most
others
in
this
style
i
hope
i
am
not
the
100th
to
make
that
obvious
joke
this
beer
is
a
nice
seasonal
beer
it
only
comes
out
in
the
sam
adams
holiday
pack
well
worth
buying
the
whole
pack
to
have
a
try
of
this
beer
d
drinks
easilysolid
flavor
light
body
no
extreme
flavors
definitely
a
more
sessionable
winter
warmer
another
solid
effort
by
sam
adams
pours
a
dark
almost
black
opaque
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
less
than
average
carbonation
moderate
lacing
nice
aroma
of
light
coffee
chocolate
dried
fruits
and
malt
tastes
malty
spicey
dried
fruity
a
little
chocolate
fizzy
flavors
are
more
subtle
than
i
anticipated
very
smooth
and
a
little
bubbly
on
the
tongue
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
nice
spices
that
really
remind
me
of
sas
winter
lager
d
i
wish
i
could
this
one
more
often
and
not
in
the
winter
mixer
pack
easy
to
drink
overall
it
is
a
solid
brew
but
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
collection
drinkability
i
wish
they
made
this
all
year
or
put
it
in
sixes
i
believe
it
is
one
of
the
better
thing
sam
adams
brews
i
could
easily
have
a
six
of
this
drinkability
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
and
another
quality
sam
adams
offering
my
only
drawback
with
this
beer
is
the
taste
isnt
as
full
as
i
would
have
liked
but
its
a
solid
winter
warmer
pours
a
clear
burnt
amber
with
a
medium
tan
head
the
foam
dies
down
rather
quickly
to
leave
a
film
and
some
decent
lacing
spices
are
dominant
on
the
nose
with
cinnamon
and
a
bit
of
nutmeg
over
a
faint
crystal
malt
backing
this
is
echoed
on
the
palate
with
the
same
spices
a
bit
of
cocoa
and
a
dry
bitter
dark
roasted
malt
finish
very
faint
fruitiness
in
the
backgroundi
guess
its
the
orange
decent
somewhat
oily
mouthfeel
overall
a
pleasant
beer
easy
drinking
and
smooth
a
good
holiday
party
maker
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
deep
redbrown
color
pour
with
a
foamy
tan
head
ripe
fruit
roasted
malt
holiday
spices
and
a
touch
of
nuttiness
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
all
of
the
above
characteristics
the
spice
comes
through
nicely
on
the
finish
smooth
on
the
palate
very
good
m
carbonation
is
maybe
a
bit
weak
beer
is
slightly
watery
pours
into
pint
glass
dark
brown
with
nice
white
head
average
retention
and
good
lacing
smell
is
rather
absent
taste
is
very
strong
of
ginger
with
citric
acid
feel
carbonation
is
a
little
high
and
very
evident
which
brings
the
mouthfeel
down
for
a
warmer
overall
this
is
a
very
bland
winter
warmer
this
beer
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
that
looks
almost
red
in
light
it
has
a
nice
tight
small
head
that
lingers
it
has
a
caramel
toffee
smell
it
has
a
nice
taste
of
roasted
malts
and
some
spices
in
the
background
it
is
warming
and
leaves
the
mouth
with
a
lingering
toffee
like
taste
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
great
on
a
cold
winter
evening
overall
a
really
good
session
beer
something
i
would
like
to
drink
regularly
every
winter
d
a
good
beer
and
a
good
drink
a
nice
case
would
work
of
this
to
drink
goes
back
easy
and
a
decent
session
beer
most
years
the
sam
adams
holiday
sampler
is
a
fixture
and
i
make
sure
to
claim
one
of
these
as
my
own
hopefully
this
never
goes
away
nice
and
malty
bready
backbone
balanced
out
by
a
touch
of
hops
both
sides
in
harmony
i
get
a
slightly
acetic
taste
that
intermingles
with
the
spices
which
are
pretty
sparse
compared
to
some
winter
warmers
which
is
a
bonus
the
malt
definitely
carries
the
beer
its
not
too
bad
but
a
little
bit
of
a
slightly
sour
taste
aside
from
that
theres
a
little
zest
up
front
not
to
be
confused
with
the
sourness
something
like
the
orange
or
coriander
youd
get
from
a
wit
rich
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
keeps
things
lively
nice
balanced
medium
body
not
overly
coating
yet
not
real
watery
either
not
the
greatest
thing
ever
but
a
nice
little
session
beer
for
the
winter
months
a
shame
it
only
comes
in
the
winter
mix
12
mouthfeel
is
medium
but

you

notes
really
glad
that
i
had
this
and
yes
it
should
be
generally
released
not
just
in
the
holiday
pack
d
very
drinkable
a
session
beer
a
red
alemalt
flavor
throughout
my
favorite
of
the
winter
mix
pack
d
enjoyable
winter
brew
not
sure
its
worth
all
the
hype
but
definitely
a
brew
id
look
to
enjoy
once
per
season
served
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
bottle
color
is
a
deep
ruby
tan
head
of
about
three
quaters
of
an
inch
formed
decent
lacing
left
as
i
drank
the
beer
smells
of
plums
and
cherries
with
caramel
and
biscuit
notes
tastes
of
rosted
malt
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
with
spices
also
some
nuttiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
easier
to
drink
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
seasonal
this
one
is
actually
pretty
damn
good
im
not
that
big
a
fan
of
winter
warmers
but
this
has
a
nice
flavor
pick
up
the
winter
mixed
pack
its
really
worth
it
d
although
the
smell
and
taste
arent
amazing
this
is
a
pretty
sessionable
brew
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
the
abv
does
make
this
one
easy
to
pound
the
flavors
arent
going
to
blow
your
mind
at
all
but
they
dont
limit
this
to
seasonal
beer
imo
not
bad
at
all
but
nothing
amazing
at
all
verdict
as
youd
expect
from
a
sam
adams
offering
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
that
special
id
heard
great
things
about
this
beer
but
it
just
seems
kind
of
average
to
me
certainly
not
worth
buying
the
mixed
winter
twelvepack
just
to
get
two
bottles
of
this
beer
but
not
necessarily
the
weak
spot
in
the
pack
either
i
was
surprised
by
how
good
i
found
this
beer
admittedly
i
dont
have
as
much
experience
with
boston
beer
as
most
people
on
beeradvocate
i
havent
liked
all
their
beers
but
this
beer
is
excellent
only
second
for
me
to
the
imperial
pilsner
for
the
brewery
the
nose
has
some
nice
notes
of
orange
rind
and
cinnamon
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
and
hits
a
lot
of
good
notes
as
a
winter
warmer
for
me
the
spice
is
not
overpowering
or
artificial
the
aftertaste
could
use
a
bit
more
bitterness
but
the
malt
is
a
so
nice
that
its
not
a
big
complaint
the
look
also
works
well
for
me
as
a
winter
warmer
with
deep
rich
brown
liquid
and
some
alright
lacing
its
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
another
decent
offering
from
the
winter
classics
mix
pack
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
great
carbonation
spices
are
balanced
sweetness
is
a
little
overpowering
but
still
good
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
i
like
great
lakes
christmas
ale
a
little
more
drinkability
feels
just
about
perfect
for
the
season
sure
to
become
a
winter
classic
in
my
fridge
d
pretty
drinkable
only
wish
this
stuff
came
in
six
packs
d
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
without
being
overdone
d
drinkability
is
as
high
as
it
gets
good
flavor
good
looks
spot
on
from
the
ol
boston
boys
part
of
sampler
pack
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
it
was
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
smelled
predominantly
of
caramel
cinammon
maybe
the
taste
was
malty
and
smooth
i
was
expecting
a
much
heavier
beer
it
definitely
tasted
better
to
me
as
it
warmed
a
little
i
was
better
able
to
distinguish
the
subtle
flavors
overall
a
nice
winter
beer
d
pretty
good
certainly
fits
the
title
of
a
warmer

drinkability
nice
version
of
a
winter
warmer
too
bad
this
one
is
seasonal
as
i
could
see
the
fridge
stocked
with
this
one
constantly
pours
with
a
little
head
which
quickly
dissipates
beer
is
a
coppery
color
with
carbonation
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
like
most
winter
warmers
malty
sweet
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
hoppy
bit
on
the
back
to
let
you
know
its
beer
overall
not
too
bad
rather
unremarkable
though
a
really
nice
winter
warmer
just
wish
they
this
available
in
six
packs
this
is
candy
beer
tastes
like
some
one
melted
down
the
bowl
of
hard
candy
that
every
receptionist
at
every
office
has
sweet
syrupy
taste
throughout
orange
rind
and
ginger
cut
through
the
melted
hard
candy
taste
a
little
good
but
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
dan
enjoyable
one
to
have
a
couple
times
each
winter
i
think
this
beer
has
one
of
the
more
pronounced
spice
flavors
among
the
spiced
winterholiday
beers
bbc
hit
a
homerun
with
this
one
it
really
exceeded
my
expectations
a
great
deal
i
was
expecting
good
but
this
is
excellent
its
unfortunate
that
sam
adams
releases
the
winter
lager
in
6
and
12
packs
yet
confines
this
to
the
seasonal
mix
pack
this
is
far
superior
to
the
winter
lager
and
deserves
to
be
their
primary
winter
seasonal
release
at
least
thats
my
02
highly
recommended
average
drinkability
dvery
drinkable
without
being
cloying
or
tiresome
like
some
warmers
i
regret
that
this
only
seems
to
be
available
in
the
winter
12
pack
everyone
says
the
same
thing
love
to
have
this
one
in
sixers
during
the
holiday
season
but
i
guess
there
needs
to
be
some
reason
to
sell
that
winter
classics
box
probably
my
favorite
sa
brew
a
tad
slick
on
the
finish
but
good
body
throughout
and
mellow
carbonation
is
right
for
the
style
in
fact
it
might
have
benefited
from
a
bit
less
overall
one
of
the
more
drinkable
winter
warmers
and
one
that
could
easily
find
enjoyment
outside
of
the
season
certainly
the
best
part
of
the
holiday
sampler
too
bad
its
not
available
on
its
own
though
one
of
the
more
complex
beers
sam
adams
has
ever
made
i
wish
they
would
sell
it
on
its
own
and
not
in
mix
packs
di
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
any
session
d
my
first
try
of
fezziwig
on
what
passes
for
winter
in
california
quite
pleasant
id
have
more
of
this
d
anglophile
at
best
its
like
a
brooks
brothers
suit
classic
but
just
a
bit
boring
when
you
get
down
to
it
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
on
the
subzero
night
i
drank
it
a
very
well
done
warmer
taste
here
is
of
roasted
and
toasted
malts
and
caramel
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
noted
on
the
label
are
noticeable
also
as
well
as
the
orange
which
i
am
not
sure
i
would
have
been
able
to
pick
out
with
out
reading
the
label
first
as
it
is
in
the
background
for
sure
good
seasonal
beer
here
i
as
many
others
would
like
to
see
this
sold
by
itself
d
this
was
my
first
taste
of
old
fezziwig
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
pleasant
not
overpowering
taste
very
smooth
with
the
light
carbonation
just
right
for
the
beer
i
might
continue
to
get
the
winter
pack
as
this
and
the
holiday
porter
are
very
tasty
beers
other
comments
a
fairly
festive
ok
ale
but
it
doesnt
really
have
that
certain
x

that
makes
a
beer
memorable

with
a

thumbs
up
i
hadnt
had
one
of
these
beers
in
years
and
ive
never
reviewed
it
so
i
decided
to
grab
a
12
of
the
winter
pack
from
this
brewery
and
try
one
again
pours
a
medium
reddish
brown
with
good
clarity
and
an
okay
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
ring
smells
a
bit
like
a
wassail
cup
with
malt
spice
and
citrus
peel
as
well
as
a
bit
of
cherry
pretty
similar
in
taste
and
there
is
a
nice
mellow
bitterness
throughout
as
well
as
gentle
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
very
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
but
there
is
also
a
touch
of
chalkiness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
hint
of
spicy
ginger
in
the
finish
smooth
and
somewhat
porterlike
in
overall
feel
but
a
bit
sweeter
i
like
this
as
an
alternative
to
some
other
christmas
beers
mellow
and
tasty
a
very
awesome
sa
offering
one
of
my
favorites
its
a
shame
you
have
to
buy
a
twelve
pack
to
get
it
beer
pours
a
ruby
amber
color
with
a
slightly
sticky
cap
of
cream
colored
foam
the
aroma
is
balanced
with
caramel
malt
earthy
cinnamon
and
some
hoppiness
fairly
smooth
and
light
to
medium
bodied
on
the
palate
the
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
more
cinnamon
and
perhaps
other
spices
common
in
the
holiday
season
some
bitterness
toward
the
end
as
well
the
beer
finishes
with
a
strange
hollow
spicy
aftertaste
this
beer
is
well
balanced
but
still
comes
off
a
little
peculiar
to
me
i
would
say
hype
and
the
exclusive
holiday
packaging
is
the
genius
of
this
one
d
this
ones
very
tasty
but
its
a
tad
gimmicky
for
that
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
a
lot
of
people
clamor
for
it
to
be
released
in
sixers
but
i
feel
that
a
lot
of
the
charm
would
be
lost
in
the
process
i
guess
thats
my
way
of
saying
its
a
touch
overrated
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
it
i
agree
with
others
that
this
is
the
best
of
the
winter
classics
pack
glad
i
saved
it
for
last
and
would
like
to
see
it
in
its
own
six
pack
d
excellent
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
chewy
and
at
the
swallow
a
tad
sandpapery
thick
and
decent
altogether
just
too
sweet
for
the
likes
of
me
cherry
and
caramel
with
a
little
cinnamon
would
definitely
recommend
the
pour
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
the
nose
is
caramelized
malt
molasses
a
fruity
note
with
hints
of
spice
the
taste
is
is
medium
body
fruity
with
hints
of
citrus
and
hops
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
overall
a
good
beer
i
think
that
samuel
adams
made
this
beer
fun
to
drink
and
enjoy
during
the
holidays
d
good
lower
on
alcohol
than
some
warmers
which
makes
it
better
however
i
would
like
to
purchase
this
beer
without
it
being
in
a
12
pack
too
bad
sam
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
sensory
pint
poured
a
translucent
chestnut
with
a
one
inch
offwhite
cap
embedded
with
ringlets
foam
eventually
receded
into
a
band
of
bubbles
around
the
perimeter
and
a
soapy
slick
in
the
center
some
spatterings
of
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
nose
was
malty
with
a
touch
of
nutmeg
but
also
a
little
metallic
malt
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
caramel
revealed
in
the
mouth
with
a
light
hops
bittering
towards
the
back
flavorful
without
being
cloying
mouthfeel
fell
between
light
and
mediumbodied
with
a
consistent
level
of
carbonation
throughout
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
winter
warmers
out
there
drinkability
is
better
than
average
and
with
a
5
9
you
can
have
more
than
one
per
session
pours
a
clear
dark
red
brownishred
smell
candy
sweetness
from
the
malts
orangeginger
is
fairly
upfront
with
cinnamon
and
earthy
hops
in
the
background
taste
big
malt
sweetness
caramel
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
but
not
overly
sweet
out
of
the
spices
the
cinnamon
is
the
most
prominent
moreso
than
in
the
winter
lager
drinkability
is
good
as
is
typical
for
sa
offerings
for
a
winter
warmer
it
could
certainly
benefit
by
being
a
bit
heftier
in
every
area
the
brewers
have
clearly
shown
some
restraint
here
sacrificing
flavor
and
alcohol
for
drinkability
it
is
a
good
tradeoff
as
they
have
produced
a
beer
that
can
be
consumed
in
bunches
not
huge
bunches
but
you
can
definitely
down
more
than
one
d
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
there
were
little
nuances
that
were
out
of
place
and
just
hurt
the
overall
beer
itself
probably
wont
drink
again
drinkability
is
good
but
not
something
i
could
enjoy
more
than
two
of
without
switching
back
and
forth
d
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
getting
more
before
the
season
is
out
d
drinks
well
but
nothing
this
rich
and
spicy
can
be
chuggable
could
through
a
few
of
these
back
to
ease
the
holiday
madness
mid
body
beer
good
carbonation
drank
well
i
like
this
beer
i
will
drink
again
a
nice
holiday
offering
d
a
little
spicy
to
have
more
than
a
couple
of
but
certainly
a
great
way
to
start
an
evening
very
good
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
im
finding
a
dont
care
for
hops
too
much
as
im
new
to
beer
so
this
one
is
definitely
good
for
me
a
solid
beer
but
a
bit
to
spicy
from
my
taste
not
over
the
top
throw
everything
into
the
kettle
spicy
but
just
a
bit
more
than
i
care
for
i
like
with
the
warm
from
winter
warmers
comes
from
alcohol
and
sweet
maltiness
still
an
enjoyable
session
winter
beer
d
decent
good
overall
i
have
other
winter
ddecent
could
only
have
one
or
so
of
these
but
its
a
nice
treat
to
compliment
the
season
id
suggest
it
to
others
everyones
favorite
beer
found
only
2
beers
per
12
pack
this
winter
warmer
pours
a
deep
brown
liquid
with
a
fleeting
off
white
head
lots
of
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
cinnamon
spiced
desserts
fruit
and
nuts
are
also
present
taste
is
the
above
christmas
dessert
platter
livened
up
by
a
nice
hop
addition
mouthfeel
is
helped
a
lot
by
the
hop
aspect
otherwise
it
might
just
be
too
full
of
a
brew
that
said
its
still
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
d
a
lighter
brew
than
most
sam
adams
beers
overall
this
is
a
well
brewed
beer
i
wish
they
would
sell
this
in
a
12
pack
go
buy
some
d
when
i
sit
around
the
fire
for
the
holidays
this
will
be
one
of
the
beers
in
the
fridge
that
i
will
certainly
enjoy
taste
is
a
little
on
the
watery
side
nutmeg
cinnamon
ginger
and
malts
ends
a
little
bitter
good
beer
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
reddness
produced
a
nice
1
inch
head
light
tan
in
color
very
good
aroma
bringing
back
memories
of
my
mom
cooking
for
christmas
loved
the
sweet
spicey
effect
the
taste
followed
the
smell
with
a
strong
presence
of
holiday
spices
this
went
down
very
easy
and
wish
i
could
buy
it
without
having
to
buy
a
sampler
d
an
interesting
beer
with
alot
going
on
i
can
see
why
people
want
this
one
sold
on
its
own
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
not
a
whole
ton
check
it
out
if
you
get
the
chance
the
winter
mixed
pack
is
a
winner
merry
christmas
a
really
tasty
addition
to
the
tasters
pack
this
one
is
just
what
a
winter
warmer
should
be
a
fairly
deep
brown
color
with
a
solid
head
and
a
touch
of
lacing
nose
is
super
malty
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
bunch
of
spices
tossed
around
in
there
as
well
a
touch
of
hoppiness
but
this
very
much
a
spicy
malt
brew
and
not
a
huge
alcohol
presence
either
a
solid
mix
of
dried
fruit
in
there
body
is
medium
with
appropriate
carbonation
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
a
good
tasty
fairly
straightforward
good
winterdrinking
brew
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
and
an
excellent
entry
to
the
winter
warmer
style
this
paired
really
well
with
ginger
cookies
just
like
the
bottle
said
ill
have
to
buy
another
mix
pack
this
season
suggestions
welcome
for
what
i
should
do
with
the
cranberry
lambic
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
samuel
adams
shaker
glass
appears
a
clear
brownamber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
ecru
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
within
a
few
minutes
smells
of
rich
dark
fruits
such
as
cherries
and
plums
there
are
also
notes
of
cinnamon
ginger
and
caramel
malt
taste
is
bready
cinnamon
mildly
spicy
ginger
and
cherries
with
a
bitter
finish
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
i
look
forward
to
a
few
bottles
of
this
each
holiday
season
havent
had
this
stuff
in
ages
and
never
previously
reviewed
it
it
looks
pretty
much
identical
to
soda
has
the
same
dark
caramel
color
to
it
as
well
as
a
similar
style
head
taste
is
interesting
but
i
remember
the
first
time
i
tasted
it
it
was
a
completely
new
experience
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
really
come
through
in
the
smell
and
the
flavor
also
an
overall
nice
maltiness
is
present
just
a
real
nice
mixture
of
flavors
a
really
nice
winter
brew
drinkability
even
though
this
beer
is
classified
as
a
winter
warmer
it
tastes
to
me
more
like
a
bock
in
that
case
i
think
there
are
better
options
out
there
not
much
of
a
session
beer
for
me
due
to
the
thick
aftertaste
and
overall
heaviness
all
in
all
not
bad
sam
adams
has
yet
to
miss
its
mark
other
than
the
black
lager
very
good
beer
fits
the
classic
winter
warmer
profile
orange
bitterness
near
the
end
drags
down
the
drinkability
a
tad
but
still
very
nice
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
red
highlights
head
is
minimal
on
this
one
and
lacing
is
sparse
spicy
aroma
notes
of
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
with
a
light
citrus
aroma
in
the
background
flavor
has
a
nice
spicy
quality
lots
of
caramel
malt
hints
of
chocolate
and
orange
somewhat
sweet
bitter
in
the
middle
and
dry
on
the
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
slick
and
semichewy
i
liked
this
winter
warmer
and
like
most
bas
i
wish
they
made
it
available
in
sixers
instead
of
only
in
the
holiday
mixed
pack
but
i
must
say
i
enjoy
the
winter
lager
more
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
is
full
of
bubbles
aroma
is
malty
caramel
cinnamon
and
orange
taste
is
malty
cinnamon
with
ginger
cant
really
taste
the
orange
this
beer
is
awesome
i
really
wish
they
would
put
a
6pk
of
this
out
for
the
winter
season
not
just
in
the
variety
pack
like
it
reads
on
the
website
old
fezziwig
is
the
christmas
cookie
d
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
spiced
winter
warmer
both
the
spices
and
the
beer
blend
well
and
play
their
parts
well
d
while
its
not
a
big
boozebomb
i
find
the
flavour
to
get
a
little
intense
over
the
course
of
the
glass
so
it
does
make
for
a
better
sipper
not
too
shabby
though
this
is
an
excellent
winter
warmer
it
is
actually
a
winter
warmer
also
unlike
many
phoneys
that
slap
the
title
winter
warmer
on
their
beer
at
this
time
of
year
smells
of
roasted
nuts
caramel
and
cinnamon
tastes
of
the
same
very
nice
flavorful
beer
one
of
the
best
warmers
you
can
find
filling
in
nature
and
has
some
nice
juicy
twinge
of
hops
on
the
back
a
dry
warming
alcohol
flows
through
probably
could
have
been
another
percent
higher
in
alcohol
and
kept
the
balance
drinkability
is
high
i
really
liked
this
beer
from
sa
d
as
the
label
stated
it
def
goes
very
well
with
gingerbread
cookies
i
tried
it
out
myself
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
plus
it
was
cold
outside
as
i
drank
it
and
it
warmed
me
up
well
i
love
this
beer
am
excited
when
it
shows
up
each
year
but
can
not
answer
why
this
is
not
available
on
draught
here
in
boston
sam
adams
could
definitely
do
this
harpoon
has
no
immediate
threat
with
a
similar
offering
while
the
head
dissipates
to
lace
after
pouring
the
roasted
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
portercoffee
aroma
excels
the
taste
builds
on
this
with
a
christmas
zest
of
cinnamongingercittrus
spice
yet
not
too
sweet
nice
dark
blackamber
brew
for
a
snowy
night
they
really
need
to
offer
this
as
a
sixer
or
in
twelves
all
year
long
of
course
a
name
change
would
be
ideal
for
year
round
drinkability
this
is
easy
enough
to
drink
and
it
does
do
well
for
a
cold
night
i
could
come
back
to
this
often
old
fezziwig
is
fullish
in
body
very
smooth
and
mildly
carbonated
the
drink
is
mild
easy
and
very
refereshing
and
is
without
a
doublt
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
offerings
from
sa
drinkability
i
only
wish
i
could
have
this
year
round
it
is
very
tasty
and
i
would
love
to
pick
up
a
few
cases
for
the
non
winter
season
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
old
fezzi
pours
a
dark
orange
some
red
hues
with
a
huge
head
the
head
disipates
rather
quickly
leaving
beutiful
rings
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
dried
fruit
the
label
list
the
generous
amounts
of
spices
used
but
i
can
neither
smell
or
taste
them
the
malt
profile
is
huge
the
taste
is
of
dates
and
raisins
a
smooth
beer
the
finish
is
lingering
the
malty
sweetness
holds
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
pours
amber
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
decent
retention
and
very
nice
laceing
aroma
is
of
sugar
and
spice
with
some
fruit
and
alchol
notes
body
is
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
of
carmel
malts
and
spice
hints
of
burbon
and
fruit
with
a
peppery
finish
very
nice
drinkability
couldnt
imagine
myself
getting
tired
of
this
especially
if
its
cold
outside
reminds
wiseman
justin
of
fw
dba
in
this
category
nick

it

justin
gives

a

5
justin
wins
since
he
bought
it
d
decent
i
like
it
enough
to
drink
a
few
but
i
would
want
something
more
complex
nice
body
good
carbonation
leading
to
a
great
overall
feel
i
like
this
warmer
seems
a
bit
filling
though
so
i
probably
would
not
run
for
another
d
this
style
was
never
meant
to
be
drank
in
excess
quantities
imo
so
to
stay
in
the
season
this
beer
is
perfect
to
enjoy
a
session
with
during
the
family
holiday
event
d
very
drinkable
this
goes
down
easy
and
is
perfect
for
a
chilly
night
like
tonight
i
really
like
this
and
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
drinkability
is
this
even
a
question
this
is
sas
stand
out
beer
that
should
be
given
to
every
beer
lover
to
try
even
ol
scrooge
would
enjoy
this
brew
its
really
too
bad
they
dont
bottle
these
by
themselves
but
i
guess
good
things
come
in
little
quantitys
i
could
sit
by
the
fire
all
night
and
polish
these
babies
an
excellent
offering
that
should
be
on
jim
kochs
radar
for
more
mass
production
i
remember
enjoying
ol
fezziwig
back
in
college
with
my
friends
pretty
sure
it
was
available
in
sixers
then
now
the
only
way
i
find
it
is
by
being
part
of
the
winter
sampler
nice
dark
amber
pour
thick
light
tan
head
and
mild
lacing
aroma
is
faint
but
i
can
detect
some
sweet
malt
and
cinnamon
surprisingly
creamy
mouthfeel
smooth
on
the
palate
and
well
received
flavor
is
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
spices
a
touch
of
citrus
is
detected
the
cinnamon
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
thoughts
of
vanilla
and
ginger
come
to
mind
mildly
spiced
this
is
another
nice
winter
treat
by
sammys
for
my
money
samuel
adams
makes
no
finer
brew
and
i
dearly
wish
they
made
this
in
6
packs
pours
a
redish
brown
a
thin
mocha
head
that
faded
fast
the
malt
dominates
the
smell
with
the
sweet
and
roasty
notes
hard
to
pick
up
the
spices
that
are
advertised
cinnimon
ginger
and
orange
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
of
the
cinnimon
and
ginger
showing
through
but
still
dominated
by
sweet
malt
but
not
super
sweet
aftertaste
is
spicy
a
nice
smooth
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
could
be
somewhat
thicker
but
still
not
bad
a
decent
balance
drinkable
d
nice
to
style
beer
rather
drinkable
as
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
malty
of
the
palate
with
once
again
some
spices
coming
out
hops
are
there
but
not
in
big
amounts
more
on
the
malty
side
that
is
gently
spiced
with
spices
conclusion
im
really
a
bit
torn
from
years
past
i
remember
absolutely
loving
this
beer
now
it
seems
pretty
good
but
nothing
spectacular
dont
get
me
wrong
its
tasty
and
festive
esp
as
it
comes
up
to
cellar
temperature
the
spice
notes
come
out
nicely
do
i
like
it
yes
do
i
love
it
no
the
sam
adams
winter
variety
pack
is
the
best
the
distinguising
feature
of
the
beer
is
the
linking
of
the
nose
to
the
finish
as
one
combined
experience
d
yeah
this
is
very
drinkable
drinkability
not
too
bad
a
fair
shade
better
than
the
cranberry
lambic
that
i
decided
to
try
first
definitely
wont
mind
having
the
other
here
d
this
was
my
first
ever
winter
warmer
back
in
1995
so
it
holds
a
special
bit
of
nostalgia
for
me
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
but
there
are
better
winter
beers
than
this
nice
chestnut
color
aroma
is
ok
malty
with
a
low
level
spiciness
to
it
great
great
malt
taste
just
enough
butterycreaminess
sort
of
flavor
some
spices
but
they
are
so
well
blended
against
the
strong
maltiness
that
they
just
seem
to
fade
into
the
mix
very
solid
mouthfeel
just
a
great
beer
for
the
holidays
or
winter
in
general
i
could
make
a
session
out
of
this
put
this
in
six
packs
please
jim
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
and
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
definitely
worth
a
shot
fairly
drinkable
but
wouldnt
make
a
very
good
session
beer
one
or
two
of
these
and
the
maltiness
would
be
overwhelming
the
oftspoken
christmas
cake
comparison
holds
very
true
this
is
a
superb
brew
for
the
holiday
season
d
drinkable
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
buy
this
stuff
i
was
hoping
for
some
subtle
spices
to
up
the
taste
but
keep
it
drinkable
too
bad
there
are
near
no
spices
at
least
in
this
one
mfd
thinmedium
bodied
ale
went
down
well
a
nice
holiday
treat
future
outlook
a
solid
addition
to
the
samuel
adams
winter
classics
mix
pack
which
i
will
surely
pick
up
again
next
season
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
mahogany
crystal
clear
tan
head
nice
stickiness
aroma
is
toasty
caramel
and
light
milk
chocolate
with
obvious
notes
of
the
added
ginger
orange
and
cinnamon
flavor
is
sweet
ashy
chocolate
up
front
with
cinnamon
toast
and
spicy
ginger
in
the
back
a
little
light
on
body
this
could
be
an
excellent
winter
warmer
with
some
more
robust
maltiness
still
good
one
of
sas
better
beers
pretty
dark
brownish
red
with
some
transluscence
ok
head
and
lacing
smells
a
bit
portery
sweet
dark
malts
some
spiciness
comes
through
mostly
cinnamon
taste
has
caramel
malt
backbone
with
noticable
yet
subtle
spices
i
dont
taste
ginger
per
se
but
i
get
a
certain
ginger
snappiness
along
with
the
cinnamon
orange
peel
compliments
the
bitterness
with
a
slightly
sweet
twinge
medium
bodied
in
relative
terms
pretty
full
bodied
for
the
style
easy
drinking
i
remember
having
this
on
christmas
a
few
years
back
when
i
first
started
getting
into
beer
loved
it
then
love
it
now
this
really
makes
me
look
forward
to
old
jubilation
and
anchor
christmas
jim
koch
should
scrap
the
2
boston
lagers
in
the
12
pack
and
add
1
or
2
more
of
these
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
spices
and
and
cinnamon
there
is
a
sweet
caramel
hint
to
it
as
well
it
smells
quite
nice
the
beer
is
a
ruby
redbrown
colour
with
a
little
head
that
fades
away
pretty
quickly
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
chocolaty
sweet
and
the
bitterness
comes
through
with
the
spices
i
mainly
taste
cinnamon
because
i
dont
really
know
what
ginger
tastes
like
the
sweetness
reminds
me
of
plums
mixed
with
a
small
bit
of
chocolate
the
beer
is
pretty
complex
actually
each
time
i
take
a
drink
i
get
a
bit
more
flavour
than
before
the
mouth
feel
is
pretty
good
the
beer
is
decently
drinkable
i
dont
know
how
many
i
could
have
because
its
fairly
complex
d
this
is
a
nice
holiday
beer
and
a
good
change
of
pace
i
couldnt
make
a
night
of
drinking
these
but
always
look
forward
to
seeing
fezziwig
when
the
weather
changes
ah
i
love
getting
a
few
mixed
packs
of
sam
adams
right
around
thanksgivingchristmas
so
i
can
have
this
beer
sucks
you
only
get
2
in
each
but
its
delicious
chock
full
of
christmas
spices
and
is
absolutely
beautiful
could
use
a
little
bit
of
a
higher
abv
being
a
winter
warmer
and
all
but
other
than
that
its
very
good
md
stickey
finish
almost
like
molasses
had
to
struggle
to
finish
the
bottle
will
pass
on
this
again
while
theres
some
sweetness
in
there
like
chocolate
and
caramel
there
is
a
good
pinch
of
cinnamon
that
is
very
noticeable
this
spiciness
dominates
the
backend
for
a
good
warming
pickmeup
great
on
a
cold
winter
day
in
orlando
where
its
in
the
50s
interesting
brownamber
color
pours
a
relatively
thick
tan
head
but
that
fizzles
down
pretty
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
not
a
whole
lot
stood
out
in
the
aroma
flavors
spices
with
ginger
some
bitterness
and
a
roasted
malt
and
coffee
finish
and
aftertaste
ginger
was
definitely
the
first
thing
that
i
tasted
very
warming
i
may
have
it
again
when
i
can
sit
inside
and
watch
the
snow
good
seasonal
brew
this
holiday
specialty
brew
shows
a
clear
but
deep
brown
color
with
red
highlights
and
sports
a
decent
white
foam
cap
along
with
a
similar
lacing
the
aroma
gives
a
fairly
delicate
sweetness
of
nutmeg
and
malt
nothing
too
heavy
but
you
detect
a
hint
of
ho
ho
ho
here
the
flavor
comes
across
pretty
much
in
the
medium
range
as
compared
to
most
holiday
beers
i
get
lots
of
malt
blended
with
the
spice
highlights
i
do
sense
citrus
for
sure
though
it
is
not
obviously
orange
as
advertized
on
the
label
and
the
cinnamon
ginger
are
also
not
so
obvious
but
the
spice
is
there
without
overwhelming
the
result
i
pick
up
some
charcoal
and
even
raisin
to
boot
as
this
sort
of
thing
goes
i
would
call
it
pretty
drinkable
alcohol
does
not
seem
to
be
an
issue
here
not
really
evident
it
is
mildly
carbonated
with
a
somewhat
aqueous
feel
not
really
watery
though
a
decent
option
if
you
want
that
holiday
feel
for
more
than
1
or
2
bottles
worth
worth
a
try
love
it
or
leave
it
alone
the
taste
is
smooth
a
bit
tart
upfront
caramel
toffee
orange
rind
lemon
rind
tons
of
citrus
cinnamon
spicy
hops
and
ginger
a
bit
watery
in
the
finish
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
the
finish
is
smooth
sweet
and
earthy
i
am
usually
a
big
fan
of
christmas
beers
but
this
one
did
not
impress
me
a
dark
bronze
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
nose
has
dark
caramel
malts
and
a
collection
of
mild
spices
the
taste
is
a
little
more
powerfull
roasted
malts
nutty
bread
and
some
mild
herbs
and
spices
i
want
more
spice
the
crisp
medium
body
passes
well
over
the
palate
pours
a
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
fizzy
tan
head
which
leaves
quickly
some
sticky
lacy
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
slight
cinnamon
slight
ginger
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
slight
cinnamon
in
there
and
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
a
nicedifferent
tasty
brew
thanks
samuel
adams
smell
of
caramel
malt
and
of
cinnamon
and
other
spice
you
can
taste
the
orange
and
other
spices
cinnamon
and
ginger
mouthfeel
is
smooth
good
for
the
style
a
very
good
winter
warmer
something
to
look
forward
to
next
year
d
great
drinkability
festive
spicing
and
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
by
sam
adams
nice
winter
warmer
drinkability
this
is
a
merely
decent
ale
and
i
would
not
find
it
overly
sessionable
as
id
prefer
to
move
on
to
something
else
after
one
or
two
of
these
now
if
only
i
could
find
these
in
packages
other
than
the
winter
packs
that
sam
does
every
year
i
hope
they
keep
this
beer
in
the
rotation
as
its
a
major
reason
if
not
the
main
reason
why
i
buy
those
winter
packs
pours
clear
dark
maroon
with
a
fizzy
quickly
fading
beige
head
smell
is
odd
at
first
but
opens
up
more
nicely
some
odd
slightly
funky
or
sour
maltish
nose
and
then
cinnamon
comes
into
the
picture
definitely
a
bit
unusual
nice
light
chocolately
toasty
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
spice
body
is
moderate
to
perhaps
a
bit
rich
and
surprisingly
so
hint
of
spice
and
cinnamon
present
and
this
is
growing
on
me
as
it
opens
up
after
a
few
minutes
maybe
a
hint
of
the
noted
orange
is
present
in
the
finish
but
im
not
even
sure
actually
maybe
just
a
faint
tartness
from
the
malt
or
hops
slightly
drying
in
the
end
as
well
a
unique
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
i
like
that
its
not
overspiced
as
so
many
holiday
beers
are
to
my
pallet
beyond
that
its
only
okay
the
flavors
balance
off
one
another
for
the
most
part
hop
bitterness
is
good
and
the
malt
is
acceptably
subtle
i
think
it
could
benefit
from
some
more
hop
flavor
less
ginger
and
more
orange
i
just
never
really
got
the
orange
while
getting
my
fill
of
ginger
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
finish
on
this
one
is
semidry
with
some
warming
notes
as
it
goes
down
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
i
feel
that
the
prickly
carbonation
takes
away
from
that
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
that
id
rather
spend
my
time
and
money
on
others
of
this
style
whether
im
exploring
or
revisiting
it
really
does
not
matter
i
dont
think
that
ill
buy
this
it
just
does
not
do
anything
for
me
appearance
when
poured
into
a
bells
brewery
pint
glass
this
sam
adams
is
a
dark
crimson
red
that
has
a
lightly
tan
colored
12
inch
head
of
foam
this
head
of
foam
quickly
fizzled
away
and
transformed
into
a
small
tan
film
tan
foamy
rings
and
a
few
streaks
of
lace
it
had
a
sweet
and
toasty
aroma
of
toasted
malts
buttered
popcorn
chestnuts
candy
sugar
and
a
small
dash
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
the
taste
was
slightly
toasted
with
candy
sugar
toasted
malts
chestnuts
cinnamon
orange
spice
plums
and
then
it
ended
with
some
toasted
bitter
hops
it
was
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
had
a
full
flavored
aftertaste
of
plums
toasted
malts
sugar
and
a
dash
of
cinnamon
and
orange
spice
basically
this
beer
tasted
like
christmas
it
was
christmas
in
february
for
me
with
this
beer
too
bad
they
dont
have
a
6
pack
of
this
thats
available
year
round
a
nicely
balanced
winter
ale
malty
with
just
a
touch
of
spices
to
add
to
the
flavor
alcohol
peeks
through
just
enough
to
be
warming
without
being
powerful
a
good
one
to
have
on
a
wintry
day
aiding
drinkability
nice
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
all
the
time
the
ale
came
in
a
variety
pack
samuel
adams
put
some
winners
in
this
variety
pack
i
wouldnt
make
this
an
everyday
drink
but
it
was
good
and
brought
up
the
value
of
the
winter
sampler
after
the
cranberry
lambic
disaster
ddecent
and
i
enjoy
this
beer
that
said
i
dont
see
myself
sitting
down
to
multiples
of
these
not
that
they
are
readily
available
that
said
i
really
liked
it
and
would
easily
have
one
again
moreys
bottom
line
if
you
like
anchor
christmas
ale
or
sam
adams
holiday
porter
then
youd
love
old
fezziwig
very
nice
the
backbone
of
the
flavor
is
caramelchocolate
malts
balanced
with
lots
of
fruit
and
spice
citrusy
resinous
hops
are
in
there
but
not
anywhere
like
those
in
my
favorite
ipas
the
aftertaste
leaves
behind
powdered
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
coffee
the
body
is
overcarbonated
but
the
thickness
is
spot
on
and
the
finish
is
almost
strong
enough
to
keep
my
interest
drinkability
is
decently
high
for
a
winter
warmer
ill
be
having
this
again
next
year
thought
id
better
review
this
one
before
it
gets
too
too
late
in
the
season
it
pours
a
dark
clear
bronze
color
with
a
decent
sized
beige
cap
the
aroma
is
nice
light
sweetness
of
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
with
distinctive
orange
and
ginger
spices
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
light
but
still
pretty
nice
light
amount
of
malt
sweetness
but
mostly
toasted
malts
with
some
citrus
coming
in
around
the
edges
a
bit
of
nutty
earth
and
bitter
chocolate
in
the
finish
lightmedium
body
with
decent
carbonation
keeps
this
one
quite
fresh
and
drinkable
a
fairly
light
and
tasty
offering
that
doesnt
really
border
on
greatness
a
pretty
good
offering
from
sammy
moderate
molasses
and
orange
hops
with
ginger
and
cinnamon
on
the
scent
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
flavor
is
a
strong
fruit
and
spice
burst
at
first
followed
by
a
moderately
bitter
finish
not
watery
at
all
for
a
5
9
rather
explosive
actually
find
me
the
biggest
christmas
goose
you
can
find
from
a
12
oz
bottle
from
the
winter
12
pack
this
poured
a
nice
rich
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
and
strong
lacing
nose
of
floral
hops
chocolate
malts
and
roasted
nuts
rich
and
smooth
mouthfeel
flavor
of
roasted
malts
with
some
floral
overtones
nice
clean
finish
very
drinkable
brew
had
this
in
the
fridge
for
awhile
thought
i
would
finally
review
it
the
appearance
is
just
great
hints
of
amber
within
its
dark
brown
colors
the
head
thinned
out
relatively
fast
but
it
was
pretty
frothy
when
poured
nice
razorthin
lacing
thick
malt
and
caramel
aromas
are
very
explicit
almost
as
if
your
drinking
the
beer
through
your
nose
the
taste
is
a
menagerie
of
flavors
such
as
spices
malt
and
caramel
the
drink
is
thick
and
not
carbonated
that
much
at
all
you
will
definitely
feel
great
after
sitting
out
in
the
cold
with
this
one
samuel
adams
continues
in
excellence
pours
dark
reddish
brownwith
a
good
amount
of
head
and
no
lacinga
lot
of
carmeland
citrus
aromas
with
a
little
spice
the
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
the
smell
leads
onsome
chocolate
and
carmel
malts
are
right
up
front
with
a
good
amount
of
cinnamonand
sweet
citrus
aftertaste
it
has
a
medium
body
good
amonts
of
carbonationa
litle
dry
i
found
this
to
be
very
enjoyableas
well
as
drinkable
d
fairly
drinkable
but
nothing
special
i
expected
a
little
more
complexity
from
the
smell
but
it
just
wasnt
there
d
nice
beer
that
is
well
balanced
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
not
trying
to
push
any
boundaries
as
it
is
a
mild
winter
warmer
will
have
the
other
and
then
wait
until
next
years
release
to
see
how
it
compares
easily
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
beers
available
too
bad
theyre
not
offered
as
a
sixer
it
would
make
the
holiday
season
so
much
better
d
overall
a
medium
bodied
and
semi
creamy
textured
brew
this
is
very
true
to
the
sam
styles
in
its
characteristics
of
being
well
balanced
and
not
too
complex
definitely
the
best
of
the
sam
adams
winter
12pack
it
just
tastes
like
winter
should
delicious
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
fits
the
season
perfectly
jim
has
made
an
excellent
beer
once
again
thanks
jim
drinkability
a
solid
wintertime
release
and
a
fine
addition
to
the
sam
adams
box
of
winter
delights
not
for
the
bmcer
and
an
enjoyable
winter
brew
the
alcohol
content
is
not
noticeable
and
a
definite
sipping
beer
will
enjoy
this
one
next
holiday
season
as
well
d
if
i
only
had
a
fireplace
exceptionally
drinkable
this
made
my
first
purchase
of
the
sa
winter
classics
worth
it
after
a
glass
my
taste
buds
were
a
little
sick
of
this
one
hops
are
prominent
but
dont
carry
the
flavor
the
spicing
is
big
but
the
beer
is
not
commensurately
so
just
a
little
out
of
whack
to
me
this
is
the
perfect
winter
beer
flavorful
hoppy
and
very
refreshing
great
job
d
overall
this
is
quite
good
maybe
a
little
on
the
spicy
side
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
drink
one
drink
many
it
doesnt
matter
you
will
enjoy
them
all
d
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
i
only
got
two
of
these
in
the
mix
pack
as
it
was
a
very
good
beer
this
beer
is
even
better
when
its
ice
cold
a
few
degrees
cooler
than
the
normal
recommended
serving
temperature
poured
an
orangy
amber
with
a
head
that
stands
pretty
strong
throughout
the
smell
was
spice
sweet
malt
and
some
hop
aroma
shows
the
taste
is
great
the
spices
blend
very
well
and
the
strong
sweet
malt
is
balanced
but
the
spices
and
malt
shine
in
this
beer
caramel
cinnamon
and
ginger
are
all
there
creating
a
wonderful
taste
of
orange
and
spices
it
is
pretty
big
so
it
would
be
perfect
to
slowly
sip
on
a
cold
winter
night
perhaps
christmas
eve
d
a
good
session
beer
the
malts
were
very
evident
although
the
spices
described
in
the
label
were
not
evident
in
the
taste
but
slightly
evident
in
the
smell
i
cannot
really
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
these
eveyr
once
in
a
while
last
beer
of
the
sam
adams
winter
sampler
and
the
best
i
must
say
i
buy
sampler
every
year
and
always
anticipate
it
just
for
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
2
inch
off
white
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
slight
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
of
toffee
and
the
typical
winter
brew
spices
taste
is
toffee
and
caramel
with
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
tail
mouthfeel
is
full
and
leaves
an
oily
coating
in
your
mouth
that
helps
the
taste
stay
with
you
probably
the
most
drinkable
beer
in
the
winter
sampler
poured
this
beer
into
a
tasting
glass
it
was
very
dark
coppersih
orange
in
color
and
nice
creamy
head
that
dissapates
to
a
14
inch
and
lasts
the
nose
is
interesting
first
impression
it
smells
like
a
ginger
bread
house
sweet
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
unique
as
well
malt
sweetness
you
get
the
spice
and
some
very
slight
hops
to
round
it
out
very
nicely
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
slippery
a
little
more
carbonation
than
i
would
have
liked
this
beer
could
be
very
drinkable
but
it
is
unique
enough
that
i
would
probably
return
to
a
favorite
before
having
a
session
of
this
beer
d
i
can
see
this
as
an
after
dinner
type
of
beer
but
im
not
sure
i
would
put
this
as
an
all
nighter
beer
i
would
love
to
see
this
released
in
a
6pack
rather
than
just
2
of
12
in
the
winter
classics
i
justify
buying
the
12packs
just
to
get
old
fezziwig
despite
my
disliking
of
the
cranberry
lambic
dark
black
body
with
a
nice
somewhat
even
trailing
of
offwhite
head
in
a
shaker
smoke
bourbon
cask
scentscaramel
and
coffee
too
inviting
a
bit
oily
and
thin
to
the
back
of
the
mouthnot
as
fullbodied
weight
worthy
of
the
fezziwig
name
a
bourbontinged
taste
a
bit
complex
and
smokeyyet
not
substantial
in
its
flavor
as
an
homage
to
dickens
this
beer
falls
a
bitshort
but
as
a
winter
wassail
suitable
and
pleasant
enough
d
a
good
winter
warmer
for
sure
however
one
or
two
is
definitely
enough
i
just
wish
it
were
more
warming
notes
an
expertly
balanced
winter
warmer
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
coming
out
of
the
us
pours
a
redish
brown
a
decent
mocha
head
that
faded
fast
the
malt
dominates
the
smell
with
the
sweet
and
roasty
notes
hard
to
pick
up
the
spices
that
are
advertised
in
the
notes
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
cinnimon
ginger
and
orange
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
of
the
cinnimon
and
ginger
showing
through
but
still
dominated
by
sweet
malt
but
not
super
sweet
aftertaste
is
spicy
a
nice
smooth
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
could
be
somewhat
thicker
but
still
not
bad
a
decent
balance
this
one
is
a
good
winter
beer
nothing
amazing
but
still
good
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
darker
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
i
get
caramel
malt
cinnamon
and
some
chocolate
to
the
nose
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
some
roastiness
hints
of
orange
spices
hops
balance
out
any
real
sweetness
a
decent
beer
fezziwig
fezziwig
fezziwig
i
think
i
have
it
out
of
my
system
now
thanks
poured
a
pretty
dark
brown
but
the
liquid
was
clear
big
frothy
head
develops
but
kinda
falls
pretty
fast
thought
i
could
pick
up
a
little
cinnamon
in
the
smell
even
before
i
read
the
bottle
and
noticed
it
was
brewed
w
ginger
cinnamon
and
orange
other
than
that
it
seems
mostly
like
toasted
malt
like
it
was
brewed
with
a
lot
of
munich
andor
victory
malt
the
taste
was
heavily
toasted
malt
and
spices
were
apparent
though
not
overwhelming
you
really
had
to
look
for
the
spices
which
were
hard
to
taste
individually
except
maybe
the
cinnamon
the
mouthfeel
is
really
good
especially
for
a
festive
winter
type
ale
because
it
has
a
good
body
on
it
but
not
too
hard
to
drink
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
feels
like
you
could
sit
around
with
it
during
the
holidays
and
drink
pretty
easily
while
it
gives
you
a
good
satisfying
taste
pours
a
very
deep
brown
with
a
medium
long
lasting
tan
head
which
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
apples
and
pears
cinnamon
light
sweetness
with
a
distinct
chocolate
note
at
first
some
fruit
notes
and
spice
but
not
particularly
bitey
or
spicy
caramelly
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
smooth
full
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
which
i
think
suits
this
beer
well
pretty
drinkable
for
a
winter
warmer
overall
a
decent
beer
that
goes
down
easily
enough
but
not
good
enough
to
make
up
for
the
seriously
flawed
cranberry
lambic
that
comes
bundled
with
this
one
in
the
holiday
sampler
a
nice
beer
i
have
had
some
winter
warmers
that
just
werent
very
good
but
this
one
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
in
the
style
light
to
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
somewhat
oily
and
sticky
on
the
palate
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
but
it
is
available
only
in
mixed
12s
i
got
what
i
expected
with
this
one
and
thats
almost
always
a
good
thing
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
left
a
fair
amount
of
laceing
down
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
of
roasted
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
all
of
which
come
through
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
also
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
a
cinnamon
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
very
light
and
easily
drinkable
recomended
for
anyone
who
is
looking
for
a
quality
seasonal
this
is
a
great
holiday
ale
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
once
upon
a
time
in
the
mid
90s
this
beer
was
available
in
six
packs
i
wish
sam
adams
would
once
again
sell
it
outside
of
the
winter
12
pack
case
oh
well
on
to
the
holiday
porter
pours
a
burgundyamber
color
with
a
great
frothy
head
that
sticks
around
good
lacing
smells
of
holiday
cheer
for
some
reason
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
my
childhood
around
xmas
taste
is
malty
some
alcohol
presence
cinnamon
ginger
hop
spice
finish
dry
finish
decently
drinkable
an
average
winter
seasonal
its
not
bad
but
doesnt
do
much
for
me
either
something
is
lacking
and
offkilter
id
much
rather
drink
sam
smiths
winter
welcome
poured
from
bottle
into
chalice
pours
a
deep
dark
ruby
with
slightly
offwhite
head
some
retention
and
some
lacing
smell
is
a
blend
of
malt
cinnamon
orange
almost
a
creamy
orange
and
something
else
i
cant
distinguish
biscuit
perhaps
little
heavy
on
the
malt
for
my
taste
speaking
of
taste
something
just
isnt
right
here
not
that
its
terrible
but
of
the
winter
beers
ive
tried
thus
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
very
heavy
again
on
the
malt
some
spices
cinnamon
sticks
out
the
most
medium
to
almost
heavy
mouthfeel
leaves
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
overall
another
mediocre
offering
from
sam
adams
to
me
this
tasted
like
their
octoberfest
with
some
different
spices
added
not
too
great
the
flavors
here
are
very
balanced
a
highly
drinkable
example
of
the
style
might
lean
toward
the
spicier
end
of
the
spectrum
but
consider
the
style
and
also
consider
how
many
winter
warmers
are
undrinkable
due
to
reckless
overspicing
good
stuff
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
tan
singlefinger
head
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
a
touch
of
orange
and
cinnamon
smells
the
front
taste
is
all
malts
that
gives
way
to
the
ginger
and
cinnamon
tastes
and
finished
by
a
little
bit
of
a
piney
hops
bite
i
wasnt
able
to
detect
any
orange
even
though
there
seemed
to
be
some
in
the
smell
this
beer
has
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
but
might
be
a
little
to
heavy
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
at
a
time
if
spiced
beer
is
your
thing
this
beers
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
everyone
should
try
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
in
the
holiday
12pack
my
only
complaint
is
they
only
put
two
in
the
package
overall
a
splendid
holiday
ale
that
i
sometimes
go
without
when
i
dont
feel
like
buying
the
entire
12
pack
just
to
obtain
2
of
these
bottles
this
year
i
did
and
am
very
glad
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
encountered
its
a
playful
yet
regal
ale
that
meets
you
on
many
different
levels
given
your
mood
and
disposition
a
fantastic
holiday
ale
for
sure
d
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
from
sam
adams
one
of
the
best
ive
tasted
from
them
and
would
be
the
first
id
reach
for
out
of
their
mixed
sixes
or
twelves
great
in
winter
but
im
not
sure
how
it
would
hold
up
in
summer
the
color
was
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
hue
when
poured
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
candy
spice
with
a
hint
of
caramel
was
evident
in
the
aroma
the
taste
although
a
little
weak
was
of
semi
sweet
roasted
malts
caramel
and
a
hint
of
spice
and
molassas
a
nice
winter
ale
sitting
around
the
fire
just
bsing
not
really
overpowering
just
a
mellow
warmer
drinkability
i
will
be
honest
when
i
had
this
fresh
i
was
less
than
impressed
but
with
a
year
on
it
the
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
i
would
love
to
find
more
year
old
fezziwig
again
but
it
is
likely
to
be
a
fat
chance
as
i
will
have
to
buy
more
full
samplers
just
to
get
them
bottle
these
seperately
sam
adams
hmmm
quite
the
interesting
winter
warmer
i
liked
the
spicy
aroma
and
taste
but
the
whole
thing
just
lacked
a
certain
beefiness
that
i
like
in
my
cold
weather
beers
it
was
nice
to
try
once
but
i
dont
really
see
any
need
to
go
back
spicing
does
not
go
too
far
maltiness
is
big
enough
to
hold
the
beer
together
a
solid
beer
all
around
and
a
bit
of
a
conversation
beer
as
well
which
is
good
around
this
time
of
year
personally
i
found
this
to
be
a
little
bit
of
a
malty
mess
alcohol
thought
the
beer
isnt
that
strong
manages
to
muddle
in
with
the
caramel
malt
so
it
doesnt
have
a
clear
character
on
the
sweet
side
with
no
bitter
character
to
balance
it
out
im
all
for
a
winter
warmer
but
honestly
this
was
a
bit
like
bad
candy
sugar
more
alcohol
to
counteract
the
sweetness
and
a
stopgap
on
the
caramel
would
help
this
beer
tremendously
to
become
a
true
winter
warmer
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
really
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
am
very
much
enjoying
this
beer
my
palate
was
less
developed
a
few
years
ago
when
i
last
purchased
the
sa
winter
classics
pack
at
that
time
i
gave
the
second
fezziwig
to
a
friend
he
isnt
getting
it
this
time
id
buy
a
six
or
a
twelve
pack
of
this
if
it
was
available
outside
of
the
winter
classics
pack
d
pretty
tasty
but
i
think
there
are
a
lot
better
winter
warmers
out
there
this
is
a
solid
one
that
you
cant
go
wrong
with
though
dark
brown
leather
shoe
colored
appearance
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
smells
like
butterscotch
to
me
i
dont
really
detect
the
cinnamon
chocolate
caramel
ginger
or
orange
that
the
label
states
i
just
taste
a
butterscotch
type
of
flavor
perhaps
the
combination
of
all
of
those
things
create
what
i
think
im
tasting
its
an
odd
sort
of
sweet
flavor
that
i
dont
ever
remember
tasting
in
a
beer
before
its
nice
but
i
think
i
only
want
one
per
day
and
then
i
would
like
to
switch
to
a
more
traditionally
flavored
brew
d
this
is
pretty
good
i
think
i
like
it
better
than
their
winter
lager
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
maybe
a
bit
high
in
the
spices
to
drink
to
many
drinkability
pleasant
drinkable
winter
warmer
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
malt
flavors
but
it
taste
pretty
light
and
just
didnt
satisfy
my
need
for
a
winter
warmer
on
a
cold
winter
night
d
spiced
winter
beers
are
not
usually
something
i
like
a
lot
of
but
this
sam
adams
product
was
a
very
nice
surprise
i
tried
the
sam
adams
holiday
porter
a
couple
nights
before
and
as
far
as
color
there
is
very
little
difference
poured
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
into
my
large
tulip
shaped
beer
glass
there
was
a
small
off
white
head
with
very
little
retention
or
lacing
that
hung
around
there
was
some
carbonation
that
i
could
feel
in
my
mouth
but
hard
to
notice
when
held
up
to
the
light
you
can
taste
presents
of
hops
and
a
dark
chocolate
malt
taste
maybe
some
citrus
not
sure
about
that
the
alcohol
was
not
over
powering
for
me
i
think
i
would
not
hesitate
to
purchase
a
six
pack
of
this
as
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
everything
i
wanted
out
of
a
winter
warmer
dark
thick
and
spicy
it
had
that
nice
bready
feeling
when
youre
drinking
a
beer
that
goes
down
perfectly
im
happy
it
comes
in
the
winter
variety
pack
but
id
easily
buy
this
again
on
its
own
d
i
was
drinking
this
in
a
pint
glass
while
writing
the
review
and
realized
its
halfway
gone
already
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
with
very
good
tastes
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
was
great
on
a
cold
winter
night
and
i
wish
it
came
in
its
own
package
i
could
drink
this
one
throughout
the
winter
give
me
another
please
d
wish
i
could
buy
this
in
a
six
or
twelve
pack
very
drinkable
even
as
a
beer
to
relax
to
d
this
is
nice
to
drink
i
could
have
enjoyed
a
few
more
of
these
seems
to
be
more
of
a
session
beer
than
other
warmers
ive
had
this
season
not
too
harsh
not
too
heavy
not
too
boozy
just
pleasant
with
sweetness
and
spice
and
everything
nice
d
at
5
9
and
a
great
taste
you
can
drink
them
all
day
pours
out
a
ruby
tinged
chestnut
with
a
decent
sized
head
that
leaves
some
spread
out
lacing
aroma
is
big
on
cinnamon
orange
and
ginger
but
none
of
these
flavorings
are
overpowering
has
a
decent
malt
base
that
gives
off
a
brown
sugar
feel
in
the
nose
flavor
is
rather
cinnamon
forward
it
would
seem
to
me
that
cassia
cinnamon
is
used
here
rather
than
ceylon
cinnamon
giving
it
more
of
a
wood
shaving
flavor
aside
from
that
the
sweetness
rides
too
high
here
and
aside
from
the
spicing
the
beer
is
rather
lacking
cloying
sweetness
ruins
it
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
has
a
mild
carbonation
drinkability
eh
drinkability
not
the
best
beer
but
decent
enough
to
warrant
a
try
i
am
not
disappointed
to
have
this
in
my
holiday
mix
pack
but
definitely
think
it
is
the
weakest
of
the
bunch
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
low
as
this
isnt
to
tasty
and
the
spices
are
overwhelming
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
distinct
flavor
i
recall
liking
this
better
then
i
did
maybe
better
served
cold
rather
then
cellar
temp
as
i
did
today
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
there
is
nothing
really
outstanding
about
the
flavors
its
just
a
nice
sweeter
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
light
fine
carbonation
that
acts
as
a
wonderful
effervescent
with
the
spices
drinkability
is
fairly
high
due
to
the
well
balanced
nature
of
this
winter
warmer
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
if
only
it
could
be
liberated
from
the
mix
12
packs
too
bad
you
cant
buy
this
in
a
sixer
drinkability
interesting
flavor
this
flavor
heavy
brew
is
a
nice
departure
from
the
typically
sweet
and
overspiced
holiday
brews
overall
a
decent
winternightcap
beer
this
is
a
fine
winter
warmer
and
another
winner
from
sam
adams
im
glad
i
gave
this
beer
another
try
my
first
impression
was
wrong
light
to
medium
bodied
taste
is
mostly
malty
roasted
but
the
ginger
comes
over
and
above
everything
else
and
it
unfortunately
does
not
blend
in
that
well
it
gets
too
much
quite
fast
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
just
under
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
holds
to
just
cover
the
beer
and
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
fresh
coffee
and
hot
chocolate
mix
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
but
i
cant
pick
to
much
think
im
coming
down
with
a
cold
mouthfeel
light
and
carbonation
ok
drinkability
is
very
good
to
bad
its
only
in
the
winter
mix
pkg
d
the
beer
went
down
easy
reminds
me
of
spending
a
winter
night
chilling
and
relaxing
after
a
long
day
of
work
came
home
to
find
my
wife
had
picked
me
up
the
sam
adams
winter
mix
pack
poured
a
relatively
deep
brown
color
with
a
thick
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
smell
is
very
caramel
maltyness
ginger
is
there
as
well
the
taste
is
very
balanced
the
spices
blend
together
very
well
without
one
being
more
noticeable
than
the
other
a
very
smooth
brew
somewhat
syrupy
on
the
finish
the
flavor
aroma
mouthfeel
all
come
together
preety
in
this
one
i
wish
it
was
available
outside
of
the
mix
pack
so
i
could
pick
up
a
sixer
of
it
i
was
not
able
to
ascertain
the
individual
spices
but
did
enjoy
the
complete
package
and
the
warmth
of
this
beverage
pretty
solid
brew
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
exciting
as
the
smell
would
indicate
though
appeared
deep
red
with
a
think
tan
head
which
held
on
for
a
few
minutes
smell
had
a
sort
of
candysweet
smell
with
some
spice
the
taste
was
malt
and
spicy
what
i
expected
from
the
aroma
has
a
creamy
think
mouthfeel
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbantioan
not
the
best
winter
warmer
i
have
had
but
a
very
pleasant
beer
no
less
and
very
drinkable
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fezziwigfan
but
now
i
kinda
wish
they
could
fill
growlers
with
this
stuff
its
pretty
good
pours
a
clear
very
dark
garnet
capped
off
by
a
thick
creamy
cocoatan
top
the
head
settles
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
little
to
no
lace
the
smell
is
pleasantly
spicy
with
a
backbone
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
supporting
a
toasty
malt
nose
slight
alcohol
presence
hops
aroma
is
absent
yet
fitting
for
the
style
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
the
sweet
and
toasty
malt
combines
with
the
winter
spices
and
strong
alcohol
warming
to
create
a
pleasant
winter
warmer
hops
flavor
and
bitter
are
as
absent
as
the
aroma
mediumbodied
with
moderately
high
carbonation
the
carbonation
adds
a
bit
of
bite
to
the
tongue
overall
a
good
flavor
and
a
smooth
drink
a
fine
offering
from
samuel
adams
and
a
great
choice
for
a
winter
warmer
update
december
2008
hurrah
i
had
a
complete
fezziwig
this
is
a
very
good
complex
beer
and
im
adding
some
points
to
the
original
calculation
lots
of
caramel
lots
of
roasted
chocolatey
malts
nice
spicey
additions
in
the
nutmeg
family
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
low
carbonation
nice
deep
amber
mouthfeel
in
the
aftertaste
what
a
nice
beer
for
the
holiday
season
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
god
winter
warmer
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
i
think
it
could
use
more
complexity
in
the
taste
department
but
otherwise
gets
my
vote
for
senator
very
dark
and
deep
brown
color
with
a
red
tinge
to
it
and
a
thin
head
that
disappeared
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
rather
fragrant
full
of
cinnamon
and
i
would
say
molasses
kinda
carbonated
on
the
tongue
and
can
definitely
taste
a
lot
of
spices
in
it
almost
a
cinnamon
with
a
taste
of
i
would
say
maple
syrup
with
a
very
faint
hint
of
orange
however
the
syrup
taste
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
and
dont
care
too
much
for
the
aftertaste
and
couldnt
see
having
too
many
of
them
good
thing
they
only
come
two
in
the
12
winter
specials
pack
overall
good
beer
will
keep
you
warm
in
winter
while
your
friends
think
its
something
much
darker
and
heavier
than
it
really
is
im
enjoying
this
now
with
roasted
chestnuts
a
great
snack
match
for
this
hearty
winter
ale
the
nutmeg
and
wisp
o
cinammon
taste
enhances
the
smooth
feel
nice
dark
amber
color
that
pours
nicely
then
settles
in
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
a
great
winter
brew
even
if
its
73
and
you
are
in
florida
like
me
believe
it
or
not
had
this
at
an
atlanta
falcons
game
the
ga
dome
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
but
the
head
was
nice
and
the
aroma
was
pretty
good
lacing
was
somewhat
subdued
and
ill
chalk
that
up
to
the
cup
the
taste
was
a
very
balanced
blend
of
roasted
malt
tastes
with
a
nice
hop
pop
along
with
some
spices
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
great
winter
beer
i
think
sam
adams
excels
with
hearty
winter
beers
for
a
cold
new
england
night
nice
beer
not
overdone
well
balanced
subtle
for
a
winter
warmer
like
the
descriptions
says
hints
of
spices
and
flavors
alcohol
is
mild
one
of
the
easiest
of
this
seasons
beers
has
a
nice
light
head
and
plenty
of
lace
good
but
not
overdone
carbonation
lovely
dark
reddish
amber
the
spiciness
is
not
overdone
which
is
the
better
way
almost
a
session
beer
d
dammit
the
spices
get
to
me
after
a
while
but
a
fine
example
of
the
holiday
style
beer
when
i
tried
this
beer
i
expected
bigger
flavors
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
other
winter
warmers
and
not
as
spicey
as
other
winter
seasonals
i
taste
the
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
cinnamon
the
low
abv
i
think
hurt
this
beer
no
warming
feeling
it
is
also
a
little
thin
for
a
winter
release
i
want
a
beer
with
some
body
this
time
of
year
it
does
make
it
easy
to
drink
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
im
glad
i
saved
this
one
for
last
it
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
w
a
thin
offwhite
head
which
dissapates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
a
strong
roasty
caramel
aroma
with
a
slight
citrusy
undertone
not
really
sensing
the
exotic
spiciness
claimed
maybe
some
faint
orange
a
tangy
rich
caramel
and
choc
malt
flavor
you
can
taste
a
hint
of
nuts
and
some
mingled
spices
but
nothing
pronounced
a
good
med
body
slightly
dry
not
too
much
co2
feels
warm
on
the
tounge
not
a
bad
beer
i
just
dont
care
for
flavored
beers
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
light
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
raisins
perhaps
plums
the
spices
dont
really
come
out
in
the
nose
the
brew
has
a
chocolate
malt
base
with
dark
fruit
notes
the
spices
follow
in
the
end
the
ginger
and
orange
peel
being
pronounced
the
feel
is
fairly
light
and
crisp
pretty
balanced
with
a
lean
on
the
bitter
side
a
good
dark
ale
with
some
nice
fruity
and
spicy
notes
a
good
change
up
from
other
malt
heavy
brews
d
much
more
drinkable
than
most
beers
stuck
with
winter
warmer
label
not
too
filling
rich
or
bitter
you
can
tell
it
has
a
lower
abv
which
helps
make
it
sessionable
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
wish
i
could
purchase
more
than
2
at
a
time
so
i
could
get
a
better
read
on
it
having
only
2
bottles
a
year
makes
it
difficult
to
remember
specifics
but
i
guess
thats
half
the
fun
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
review
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
copper
head
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
and
some
holiday
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
hints
the
taste
is
really
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
taste
with
undertones
of
nuts
cinnamon
and
some
nutmeg
flavoring
it
is
really
smooth
and
goes
down
well
this
is
an
excellent
winter
warmer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
winter
warmer
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
highly
recommended
for
its
balance
of
spices
and
sweetness
it
really
does
warm
as
it
goes
down
drinkablility
fairly
drinkable
i
mean
the
flavor
isnt
over
the
top
and
the
abv
isnt
that
high
but
i
dont
want
another
one
that
much
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
crisp
and
lively
which
contributes
nicely
to
making
this
beer
sessionable
rather
than
an
eveningender
very
drinkable
for
a
winter
warmer
from
the
0708
holiday
mix
pack
not
my
favorite
beer
out
of
this
sam
adams
but
certainly
not
the
worst
cannot
really
go
wrong
for
the
price
and
get
to
try
six
different
beers
from
the
excellent
samuel
adams
winter
classics
12pack
old
fezziwig
ale
is
a
genuine
treat
coupled
with
a
good
durable
head
its
deep
brownred
color
delivers
a
very
nice
presentation
it
is
positively
packed
with
mild
fruity
flavors
like
orange
some
cinnamon
and
other
spices
and
is
extremely
smooth
all
flavors
blend
harmoniously
and
old
fezziwig
is
all
too
easy
to
consume
this
is
really
one
of
the
best
seasonal
brews
that
sam
adams
offers
making
the
holiday
season
all
the
sweeter
the
only
drawback
is
that
sam
adams
doesnt
market
old
fezziwig
in
six
packs
too
bad
i
guess
ill
just
need
to
get
another
12pack
after
the
weekend
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
nice
frothy
brown
head
aroma
is
subtle
upfront
with
some
spice
in
the
nose
i
detect
a
hint
of
gingerbread
as
well
taste
is
malty
upfront
with
only
a
bit
of
the
spice
the
taste
at
the
back
of
the
throat
is
more
reminiscent
of
gingerbread
and
spice
very
subtle
and
not
overbearing
like
a
few
other
winter
warmers
ive
had
the
finish
is
clean
as
well
very
drinkable
and
works
well
on
a
cold
night
ill
have
to
buy
another
holiday
classics
12
or
two
so
i
have
some
to
share
but
this
box
is
for
me
d
a
great
winter
warmer
one
of
the
best
my
favourite
for
sure
out
of
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
why
they
dont
put
this
in
6packs
is
beyond
me
probably
the
best
beer
to
pair
with
fragrant
spicefilled
pumpkin
pie
right
out
of
the
oven
a
truly
fantastic
beer
i
think
most
everybody
would
like
this
brew
its
a
surprise
like
sa
black
lager
definately
worth
a
try
just
wish
it
came
in
its
own
6er
instead
of
the
holiday
12
pack
another
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
i
really
like
the
malt
character
in
this
one
ive
found
that
most
sam
adams
beers
have
a
distinctive
caramelly
maltiness
but
this
one
takes
it
farther
and
succeeds
ill
echo
the
sentiments
of
many
folks
on
here
in
wishing
that
this
was
put
out
in
sixpacks
rather
than
just
as
a
part
of
the
holiday
mixpack
id
still
recommend
picking
up
the
mixpack
aside
from
the
infamous
cranberry
lambic
all
the
beers
in
it
are
solid
drinkability
is
great
this
is
not
a
very
filling
brew
though
it
is
bold
and
flavorful
an
excellent
flavor
profile
on
this
one
cheers
d
nice
beer
a
little
bit
far
out
for
a
session
beer
it
definitely
does
the
job
for
a
couple
though
hoppy
holidays
d
a
very
rich
and
flavorful
beer
but
not
too
difficult
to
drink
this
beer
has
an
excellent
wintry
character
to
it
and
it
is
one
of
the
primary
reasons
that
i
buy
the
sam
adams
holiday
sampler
every
year
got
two
bottles
out
of
a
sam
winter
pack
initial
pour
shows
a
beautiful
deep
amberred
with
at
least
two
fingers
of
head
then
it
setles
down
to
just
a
touch
of
foam
the
smell
is
just
as
described
on
the
label
cinnamon
and
orange
most
of
all
maybe
a
touch
of
nutmeg
the
taste
hits
you
with
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
first
then
the
orange
at
the
end
in
a
nice
aftertaste
i
find
this
to
be
very
drinkable
not
as
strong
as
some
other
warmers
but
thats
sometimes
a
good
thing
definitely
recommended
poured
into
my
ommegang
chalice
nice
deep
cola
brown
frothy
head
that
sits
14
inch
tall
before
turning
into
a
thin
tan
layer
leaves
nice
lacing
as
the
head
creeps
down
the
glass
lots
of
aroma
in
this
beer
foamy
chocolaty
malt
roasted
and
nutty
with
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
in
the
back
full
in
flavor
that
starts
like
a
brown
ale
and
finishes
dry
and
tart
the
orange
is
what
i
believe
pokes
out
right
at
the
end
that
gives
the
tart
flavor
to
an
overall
malty
and
porterlike
beer
the
roasted
flavor
is
characteristic
of
a
porter
but
the
lighter
body
makes
it
almost
like
a
spiced
schwartzbier
the
body
is
clean
and
smooth
with
rich
and
mellow
roasted
malt
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
as
the
fall
sets
in
in
rochester
ny
great
value
for
the
taste
and
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
ive
had
to
date
my
favorite
in
the
holiday
pack
it
has
a
very
nice
dark
copper
color
with
good
head
although
it
has
little
lacing
considering
its
wonderful
taste
im
always
a
bit
disappointed
in
its
scent
which
is
just
average
with
barely
a
hint
of
orange
still
it
has
a
wonderful
taste
a
nice
crisp
ale
with
an
excellent
maltiness
along
with
very
nice
spice
flavors
most
notably
orange
and
nutmeg
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
is
a
wonderful
winter
warmer
this
brew
feels
full
bodied
really
smooth
and
lively
til
the
end
highly
enjoyable
feel
this
is
a
fine
fallwinter
brew
with
a
great
malt
backbone
and
flavors
that
compliment
the
season
very
well
not
nearly
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
reddishbrown
color
and
very
aromatic
tastes
very
much
like
a
brown
ale
but
a
bit
more
complex
not
much
head
that
dissipates
quickly
pretty
good
beer
i
liked
it
very
much
flavor
of
chocolate
and
caramel
decent
lacing
on
glass
flavor
is
nice
blend
of
malt
and
spices
good
stuff
this
is
almost
the
same
as
the
ab
winter
warmer
light
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
dark
color
with
a
red
tint
can
barely
see
fingers
through
glass
light
smell
of
spices
very
minimal
for
a
winter
warmer
not
much
here
to
enjoy
not
sure
if
this
should
be
listed
as
a
winter
warmer
i
am
not
trying
to
be
rude
here
but
i
am
not
a
beliver
of
sam
adams
and
this
proves
that
it
is
basic
if
that
i
just
dont
get
how
this
gets
such
good
reviews
d
ok
to
drink
but
there
are
warmer
warmers
i
prefer
over
this
one
the
beer
is
dark
red
in
color
with
a
strong
and
warming
scent
of
spices
flavors
of
cinnamon
vanilla
and
dextrin
hit
the
tongue
a
dry
finiss
from
the
wheat
malts
rounds
it
out
leaving
bready
notes
on
the
palate
another
nice
winter
brew
from
bbc
this
could
be
the
robin
to
the
winter
lager
or
the
other
way
around
finish
but
not
much
that
is
all
another
friendly
innoffensive
winter
warmer
d
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
to
sip
on
and
enjoy
the
added
flavors
are
more
prevelant
than
the
malt
flavoring
but
its
still
pretty
good
appearance
is
dark
amber
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
disapates
leaving
a
thin
film
on
top
slight
smell
of
sweet
malts
cinnamin
and
nutmeg
taste
appeared
to
be
roasted
caramel
malt
slight
orange
and
spice
having
a
medium
mouthfeel
seems
full
bodied
enough
with
good
carbonation
but
i
think
there
are
plenty
other
winter
warmers
out
there
that
i
prefer
add
a
nice
flavor
element
to
the
beer
but
dont
overpower
the
nice
malty
notes
this
is
a
nice
gentle
beer
no
big
flavors
but
still
a
pleasant
and
smooth
taste
it
pours
a
dark
red
with
tan
head
the
head
goes
away
but
theres
still
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
candylike
with
a
bit
of
cocoa
the
cocoa
carries
over
into
the
flavor
with
mellow
caramel
malt
very
easy
to
drink
i
always
look
forward
to
this
one
in
the
sam
winter
sampler
salud
pours
a
deep
brown
that
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
wide
array
of
spices
cinnamon
and
ginger
are
most
predominant
the
taste
is
a
good
blend
of
malts
and
spiced
with
a
subdued
hop
backbone
the
beer
is
light
on
the
tongue
and
low
in
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
winter
warmer
just
not
highland
cold
mountain
overall
not
sure
what
to
expect
with
a
name
like
old
fezziwig
but
i
thought
it
turned
out
remarkably
better
than
i
was
expecting
a
good
holiday
ale
slight
ginger
not
bad
orange
and
ginger
relatively
tasty
winter
warmer
its
got
a
decent
spiced
caramel
taste
with
a
bit
of
astringency
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
decent
drinkability
is
good
its
enjoyable
but
somewhat
forgettable
a
characteristic
of
many
sam
adams
brews
this
is
a
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
down
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
with
a
drinkability
that
fits
perfectly
for
the
holidays
drinkability
is
quite
good
even
with
the
dominant
spice
taste
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
creamy
feel
and
spice
pop
in
the
mouth
i
only
wich
i
could
buy
this
beer
by
itself
d
a
nice
winter
seasonal
but
not
for
me
the
one
i
drank
was
enough
cinnamon
and
spice
for
the
night
although
i
thought
this
beer
was
very
interesting
and
unique
it
was
sweet
and
contained
too
many
cinnamon
spices
not
hoppy
enough
after
one
i
decided
to
drink
a
different
beer
from
the
sam
adams
winter
12
pack
found
some
at
central
market
houston
poured
from
a
12
oz
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
amber
to
brown
with
a
fine
creamy
head
smells
spicy
and
hoppy
i
expect
bitterness
does
not
taste
bitter
i
find
lots
of
caramel
malt
some
orange
and
maybe
other
spices
medium
on
the
tongue
a
nice
sharp
fizzy
finish
its
a
little
thick
to
drink
many
but
its
good
overall
a
wonderful
beer
perhaps
bbcs
best
quite
impressive
very
tasty
and
interesting
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
the
spices
and
flavor
seem
totally
natural
unlike
some
other
beers
in
which
they
seem
fakeforced
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
rich
amber
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
rich
malt
and
spice
the
taste
was
wonderful
it
had
a
rich
malt
base
with
plenty
of
cinamon
and
other
spices
filling
it
out
the
feel
was
heavy
and
wet
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
ive
been
a
big
fan
of
sas
winter
lager
for
some
time
but
this
was
my
first
try
of
old
fezziwig
and
was
i
surprised
at
the
jump
up
now
thats
probably
due
to
my
inherent
preference
of
ales
to
lagers
while
the
lager
seems
to
be
spiced
the
ale
has
fully
accepted
the
flavors
and
plays
them
out
beautifully
wish
i
could
get
twelves
of
this
as
it
would
be
my
primary
winter
brew
as
is
i
guess
ill
be
buying
more
of
the
holiday
packs
next
year
poured
into
a
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
hue
to
it
slight
head
that
quickly
disappeared
aroma
was
spiced
with
a
hint
of
orange
tasted
exactly
like
it
smelled
nicely
spiced
with
a
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
a
very
mild
bitterness
but
complimented
the
flavor
well
went
through
the
mouth
a
little
to
quickly
overall
a
well
done
winter
warmer
nicely
balanced
should
be
popular
for
the
type
drinkability
part
of
a
mix
12
pack
the
two
i
had
were
a
real
treat
alas
i
just
have
to
look
forward
to
this
again
next
year
while
classed
as
a
winter
warmer
i
could
even
see
this
as
a
herbedspiced
beer
id
drink
it
again
but
not
if
im
buying
lovely
dark
rubymahogany
colour
with
a
tannish
head
that
sticks
the
aroma
is
rich
with
sweet
malt
and
spice
and
a
subtle
fruitiness
the
flavour
has
a
nice
complexity
with
plummy
fruitiness
alongside
toffeeish
malt
milk
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
orange
the
spiciness
becomes
more
prevalent
as
it
warms
notes
of
ginger
really
stand
out
the
body
is
rich
and
creamy
with
solid
but
restrained
carbonation
all
in
all
simply
a
delicious
brew
d
this
is
a
big
flavourful
winter
brew
fairly
warming
and
heavy
but
that
being
said
ill
probably
get
all
excited
for
a
taste
next
year
when
i
open
a
new
12pack
sampler
and
see
that
festively
dressed
bottle
again
if
youre
a
fan
of
spiced
ales
or
just
looking
for
something
different
i
actually
think
this
is
one
of
sam
adams
better
seasonals
and
is
pretty
consistent
from
year
to
year
a
tasty
winter
warmer
that
doesnt
taste
artificial
in
the
least
a
pretty
surprisingly
well
crafted
ale
from
the
boston
beer
company
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
mild
carbonation
great
dark
ruby
color
when
back
lit
tan
cream
colored
head
that
dissipates
to
a
mild
layer
on
top
leaves
a
nice
lace
around
the
pint
smell
of
a
roasted
malt
mixed
with
a
nice
caramel
tone
subtle
hints
of
spice
but
hard
to
pick
up
through
the
malt
scents
taste
is
smooth
and
chewy
strong
caramel
malt
flavor
up
front
mixed
roasted
tones
and
a
mild
touch
of
spice
slight
hint
of
a
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
in
the
aftertaste
slight
hop
presence
although
it
is
really
quite
tamed
by
the
heavy
malt
tones
nice
drink
ability
flavor
is
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
if
you
enjoy
the
caramel
and
roasted
malt
tones
in
most
winter
warmers
this
one
will
certainly
make
your
mouth
happy
this
beer
certainly
fulfills
the
well
rounded
mix
of
flavor
in
the
holiday
mix
pack
from
samuel
adams
i
look
forward
to
having
this
one
around
the
holidays
each
year
a
rereview
after
a
few
years
not
as
astounded
by
it
as
i
first
was
but
impressed
by
the
quality
nonetheless
pours
a
deep
mahoganyred
small
head
but
good
for
the
style
aroma
is
of
pumpernickle
maybe
some
nutmeg
ginger
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
as
you
sip
it
is
sweet
malt
with
overtones
of
chocolate
raisins
and
cinnamon
hit
you
as
it
goes
down
followed
by
a
warmness
brought
upon
by
alcohol
this
beer
tastes
stronger
than
it
apparently
is
i
would
think
this
were
a
higher
brew
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
the
winter
seasoneven
though
i
live
in
boring
sd
too
bad
its
only
available
in
the
ewinter
pack
the
winter
lager
went
great
in
chilli
by
the
way
overall
a
unique
and
flavorful
winter
warmer
very
sessionable
this
beer
seems
to
want
to
be
more
than
it
is
but
when
alls
said
and
done
its
an
above
average
averagely
spiced
warmer
that
suffers
from
a
lack
of
aboveandbeyond
tlc
perhaps
some
vanilla
creaminess
or
winter
spice
melange
might
have
given
it
some
real
life
but
as
it
is
the
lasting
image
is
one
almost
of
ennui
it
goes
down
well
enough
but
i
turned
off
the
jetsdolphins
game
for
the
same
reason
i
wont
likely
drink
this
beer
again
its
not
painfully
so
but
rather
fairly
boring
appears
crystaline
brown
in
the
glass
a
frothy
offwhite
head
fades
gradually
into
whisps
of
milky
bubbles
smells
strongly
of
ginger
and
wheat
perhaps
some
cinnamon
starts
a
mild
and
tasty
ginger
brew
settles
fullbodied
and
oily
the
cinnamon
coming
through
the
longer
it
sits
on
your
tongue
finishes
with
a
strong
but
shortlived
aftertaste
i
wasnt
able
to
discern
the
orange
flavor
but
perhaps
you
will
a
good
beer
overall
as
my
fiancee
put
it
its
different
not
a
beer
that
id
have
every
day
but
interesting
thats
why
i
picked
her
i
dont
find
this
very
drinkable
i
guess
its
the
orange
and
ginger
that
rub
me
the
wrong
way
the
taste
was
a
pleasant
mix
of
ginger
caramel
malts
and
some
hints
of
oranges
not
much
bitterness
to
it
but
there
wasnt
an
overwhelming
amount
of
spices
like
some
winter
ales
like
to
promote
it
was
nicely
balanced
between
the
malt
and
holiday
spices
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
clean
overall
this
is
a
solid
winter
ale
and
perfect
in
a
sampler
pack
because
it
may
not
warrant
multiple
sessions
but
good
nonetheless
my
favorite
beer
from
the
sam
adams
winter
classics
12
pack
pours
a
dark
reddish
mahogany
with
a
thin
off
white
head
very
pleasant
malty
aroma
with
a
little
cinnamon
ginger
and
orangen
peel
in
the
background
taste
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
caramel
malt
spicy
hops
and
subtle
spices
a
litle
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
too
bad
this
is
not
offered
in
six
packs
a
great
winter
warmer
drinkability
while
its
interesting
the
fruitcake
effect
could
put
me
off
after
a
few
but
still
very
drinkable
in
small
quantity
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
color
head
was
about
13
of
an
inch
thick
upon
pouring
and
only
lasted
a
few
minutes
before
becoming
just
a
thin
film
layer
with
a
foamy
tan
ring
lining
the
inside
of
the
glass
left
some
decent
lacing
aromas
of
roasty
malt
caramel
spices
such
as
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
ginger
chocolate
and
fruits
such
as
cherry
apple
and
orange
the
flavors
all
balance
each
other
nicely
and
the
flavors
do
become
a
bit
stronger
as
the
beer
starts
to
warm
the
only
drawback
is
that
there
are
so
many
flavors
going
on
here
that
they
all
seem
to
be
a
bit
bland
and
nothing
really
stands
out
maybe
there
should
be
a
smaller
number
of
different
flavors
in
order
for
greater
emphasis
to
be
placed
on
a
few
specific
ones
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
with
a
crisp
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
good
drinkability
here
as
well
not
too
shabby
at
all
definitely
worth
a
try
imo
d
i
really
like
this
beer
honestly
one
of
sam
adams
best
offerings
id
like
to
see
them
make
this
beer
into
a
higher
alcohol
version
with
more
even
more
complexity
than
it
has
samuel
adams
old
fezziwig
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
and
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
the
added
flavorings
are
definitely
noticeable
orange
and
ginger
are
both
there
as
is
cinnamon
raison
flavors
are
present
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
clear
cherry
brown
coated
with
a
modest
cream
colored
head
great
beading
the
foam
made
up
of
tight
evenly
sized
small
bubbles
good
lacing
too
the
aroma
is
roasty
and
spiced
not
subtle
but
not
overpowering
the
beery
aspects
ginger
comes
through
most
prominently
its
spiciness
bolstered
by
the
cinnamon
and
the
zesty
aspects
enhanced
by
orange
really
a
great
spicing
combination
clean
otherwise
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
english
hops
coming
through
some
caramel
and
apple
skin
as
well
the
flavor
starts
with
warm
caramel
brownness
cushioned
with
the
holiday
spices
ginger
is
again
most
prominent
but
i
feel
like
im
getting
nutmeg
with
the
gingercinnamon
combo
orange
shows
through
with
some
citrus
zest
into
the
finish
a
light
touch
of
sweet
phenolic
smoke
bittersweet
chocolatey
roast
takes
up
the
finish
with
tobacco
and
urbane
woody
english
hops
fairly
light
on
the
palate
with
softer
finely
bubbled
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
beers
and
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
spiced
beers
expertly
crafted
drinkability
this
is
a
christmas
blessing
its
beautiful
with
its
cinnamon
taste
and
goes
great
next
to
a
fire
with
a
buddy
drink
it
after
dinner
as
not
to
offend
your
food
but
perfect
to
end
the
night
with
a
great
berr
and
a
fire
and
a
buddy
d
good
stuff
my
second
favorite
out
of
the
winter
pack
behind
the
cream
stout
very
similar
to
bbcs
winter
lager
the
beer
is
just
not
as
good
as
the
sam
adams
winter
ale
i
like
the
spices
creamy
finish
and
specialty
caramel
malts
but
in
my
opinion
the
boston
beer
company
makes
an
excellent
seasonal
with
their
more
famous
winter
warmer
does
hit
the
chest
with
a
bit
of
warmth
though
thats
not
to
say
dont
try
it
but
the
two
in
the
mix
pack
hit
the
spot
overall
good
winter
warmer
nice
one
to
have
in
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
drinkabilityi
could
have
a
few
of
these
unfortunatley
i
havent
seen
it
outside
of
their
winter
sampler
the
taste
was
awful
though
i
was
expecting
a
spiced
holiday
beer
but
the
spices
were
just
way
off
it
just
didnt
seem
very
balanced
at
all
i
couldnt
finish
it
i
got
through
about
a
quarter
of
the
beer
complaining
all
the
way
before
a
friend
reminded
me
that
we
were
at
a
party
and
there
were
plenty
of
other
much
better
beers
i
dumped
it
down
the
drain
rinsed
my
glass
and
picked
a
better
beer
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
may
2007
bestby
date
its
a
beautiful
dark
ruby
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
it
appears
to
me
to
be
the
definition
of
a
winter
warmer
smells
and
tastes
warm
and
spicy
center
of
toasted
malts
bread
and
yeast
aromas
and
flavors
of
bread
clove
cinnamon
a
bit
of
citrus
orange
a
little
fizz
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
but
otherwise
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
highly
drinkable
beer
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
christmas
season
d
i
was
not
overly
impressed
considering
how
much
i
enjoyed
the
winter
lager
ill
probably
let
someone
else
have
the
second
one
in
the
pack
overall
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
return
to
this
winter
brew
once
a
year
im
not
sure
if
i
would
pick
this
up
in
sixpacks
i
think
there
are
perhaps
slightly
better
winter
brews
out
there
but
this
is
an
old
favorite
and
one
i
always
look
forward
to
revisiting
solid
stuff
winter
variety
pack
part
iii
another
winner
by
bbc
richly
malted
and
creatively
spiced
sweet
malts
begin
to
pick
up
on
dark
syrup
flavors
but
not
viscocity
bready
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
toast
nuts
chocolate
and
toffee
spices
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
and
curraco
decorate
the
aromas
and
flavors
adding
a
punch
of
variety
but
never
becomming
distracting
always
complimentary
medium
bodied
allows
for
easy
drinking
the
alcohols
and
hops
cut
through
those
holiday
foods
nicely
while
standing
on
its
own
if
needed
finishes
with
a
hint
of
spices
and
a
followthrough
of
malt
sweetness
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
brownred
color
with
a
good
sized
lingering
tan
head
theres
also
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
it
smells
like
cinnamon
orange
ginger
and
a
bit
grainydoughy
the
taste
is
very
malty
it
taste
pretty
much
the
same
way
it
smells
except
the
ginger
breadiness
and
orange
is
a
bit
stronger
in
the
taste
theres
also
a
very
slight
bitter
aftertaste
but
it
doesnt
last
long
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
a
bit
watery
the
drinkability
is
good
but
i
think
i
would
only
want
to
drink
2
or
3
at
a
time
not
a
bad
holiday
beer
at
all
like
a
lot
of
people
id
like
to
see
it
available
in
a
6pack
instead
of
just
in
the
sa
winter
classics
holiday
sampler
this
and
harpoon
winter
warmer
are
my
two
signs
that
the
christmas
season
has
begun
pours
a
rich
amberchestnut
color
with
very
little
head
strong
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spice
flavor
seems
a
little
less
complex
than
it
has
been
in
previous
years
but
still
a
tasty
spicy
character
rich
in
malty
sweetness
this
is
a
great
beer
on
a
cold
december
night
slainte
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
it
was
full
of
sugar
at
times
but
the
complexity
and
the
christmas
spirit
of
the
beer
makee
it
one
of
the
best
in
the
sam
adams
catalog
overall
ok
i
would
drink
it
if
offered
even
though
im
not
the
biggest
sam
adams
fan
12
oz
bottle
5
9abv
enjoy
before
march
mahogany
in
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
head
disappeared
rather
quickly
leaving
some
nice
patches
of
lace
clinging
to
the
glass
the
nose
if
full
of
cinnamon
orange
ginger
and
other
spices
the
malt
character
seems
to
be
on
the
line
of
a
brown
ale
and
goes
well
with
the
spices
ginger
and
orange
seem
to
dominate
the
spicy
flavors
a
bit
roasty
and
robust
this
is
a
nice
spiced
beer
and
worth
checking
out
the
only
problem
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
is
that
you
probably
have
to
buy
the
sampler
pack
to
try
it
this
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
i
definetly
would
make
a
session
out
of
this
beer
on
a
cold
day
overall
this
is
a
decent
christmasholiday
time
beer
its
somewhat
lacking
in
complexity
but
technically
its
not
flawed
i
would
expect
as
much
from
sam
adams
i
would
like
to
see
the
orange
be
brought
out
a
little
more
and
perhaps
a
darker
grain
bill
used
i
like
the
cinnimon
flavors
in
this
one
seems
like
a
good
match
for
the
winter
recommended
i
got
this
one
in
the
sam
adams
holiday
12
pack
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
sam
adams
brew
so
far
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
freshness
date
of
apr
2007
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
very
small
head
to
it
slight
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
combination
of
spices
mainly
those
listed
on
the
bottle
cinnamon
orange
and
ginger
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
slightly
less
than
one
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
the
taste
is
excellent
with
the
spices
complimenting
the
malt
and
hops
extremeley
well
although
i
love
this
beer
im
not
sure
that
i
could
drink
it
as
a
session
beer
but
its
a
great
beer
to
have
to
start
your
evening
off
right
this
beer
fits
in
great
with
the
holiday
season
to
get
you
through
the
cold
nights
do
we
get
those
in
texas
ill
be
missing
this
when
its
gone
get
it
while
you
can
drinkability
a
good
brew
to
enjoy
during
the
holidays
nice
holiday
themed
flavors
that
would
be
nice
with
christmas
and
thanksgiving
fare
even
though
the
flavors
are
different
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
while
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
if
offered
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
do
not
think
i
could
drink
this
ale
on
a
regular
basis
i
do
believe
that
it
would
be
perfect
for
sitting
near
a
fire
as
the
roasted
flavor
would
enrich
the
experience
this
is
an
ale
that
i
would
pair
with
food
i
would
probably
pair
it
with
a
pudding
desert
or
perhaps
a
toasted
sandwich
with
mustard
good
would
definitely
have
another
one
samuel
adams
old
fezziwig
ale
was
a
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
was
thick
and
had
good
retention
the
aroma
was
holiday
spices
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
full
of
spices
as
well
with
a
sweet
and
toasty
malt
base
the
finish
was
dry
it
was
medium
bodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
drinkability
was
above
average
its
a
nice
holiday
beer
part
of
the
brewmasters
collection
bottle
said
best
by
307
it
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
medium
head
it
had
a
spicy
citrus
aroma
with
maybe
a
little
caramel
taste
was
mostly
fruit
orange
with
a
little
spice
decent
mouthfeel
and
not
so
fruity
that
you
couldnt
drink
a
few
overall
id
give
old
fezziwig
ale
high
marks
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
think
that
its
just
another
fine
example
of
samuel
adams
putting
out
a
great
product
i
would
highly
recommend
it
would
be
good
to
see
it
come
in
its
own
sixpack
for
the
holidays
lots
going
on
here
it
is
creamy
and
yet
crisp
spicy
and
yet
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
provide
a
base
for
the
above
mentioned
holiday
spices
everything
seems
to
be
in
balance
this
holiday
ale
is
a
wellknit
tapestry
of
christmas
cheer
which
goes
down
easily
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
d
not
bad
i
could
have
another
a
well
made
winter
warmer
pours
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
poor
head
retention
the
smell
is
malty
very
malty
hints
of
spices
and
citrus
as
well
the
taste
here
is
nice
and
malty
but
this
is
balanced
by
the
spices
which
arent
overpowering
finish
is
dry
with
a
slight
malty
aftertaste
maybe
a
bit
thin
for
my
pleasure
but
it
is
still
has
very
acceptable
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
low
to
moderate
abv
with
spices
that
dont
overpower
makes
this
one
highly
drinkable
all
in
all
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
beers
too
bad
the
release
is
so
limited
not
the
best
from
sam
adams
ill
stick
to
the
winter
lager
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
not
impressive
pours
a
dark
rich
ruddy
brown
color
with
a
monster
of
a
head
medium
tan
in
color
nose
is
quitealty
as
expected
with
hints
of
spice
and
flowery
hops
palate
is
allmalt
up
front
with
just
a
subtle
amount
of
spices
and
hop
balance
the
spiciness
is
definitely
not
overkill
here
very
subtle
finishes
much
drier
than
it
starts
with
a
decent
amount
of
hop
acidity
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
maybe
a
slight
bit
too
thin
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
substance
here
in
the
mouth
this
would
make
this
a
very
good
winter
warmer
as
it
is
though
its
really
just
average
worth
a
try
but
not
a
top
shelf
ww
pours
a
combination
of
dark
brown
and
garnet
nice
tan
two
finger
head
nice
malty
smell
with
caramel
ginger
cinnamon
and
hints
of
cocoa
very
pleasant
taste
is
good
malts
dominate
with
caramel
and
cocoa
present
next
are
spices
tastes
like
cinnamon
ginger
and
maybe
some
molasses
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
dry
finish
body
is
mediumfull
and
a
lowmoderate
amount
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
brew
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
a
sixpack
on
its
own
overall
a
wallop
of
flavors
so
much
that
more
than
one
would
be
palate
torture
goes
down
pretty
easily
the
drinkability
would
make
this
a
nice
session
beer
and
it
doesnt
have
the
cloying
potpourri
spices
that
turn
me
off
of
most
winterwarmer
brews
id
certainly
have
it
again
easily
the
thirdbest
selection
in
the
sampler
after
the
excellent
holiday
porter
and
black
lager
i
wish
there
were
more
in
the
sampler
or
it
was
available
on
its
own
it
makes
for
a
nice
pairing
with
coldweather
comfort
foods
this
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
the
most
pronounced
flavor
is
the
caramel
malt
which
is
perfectly
complimented
by
a
slight
cinnamon
flavor
the
spices
are
not
overpowering
like
some
pumpkin
ales
but
add
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
without
obscuring
the
malt
or
hop
flavors
the
balance
of
which
is
perfect
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
but
a
little
heavy
an
excellent
seasonal
brew
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
while
the
snow
falls
outside
as
far
as
drinkability
i
do
not
even
feel
that
i
can
apply
the
same
standard
to
this
beer
as
i
would
most
others
in
warmer
weather
i
would
not
consider
this
the
most
drinkable
beer
due
largely
to
the
heaviness
as
this
is
a
winter
brew
however
the
heaviness
is
a
welcome
characteristic
this
beer
perfectly
captures
the
mood
of
the
christmas
season
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
rich
malt
nose
with
aromas
of
chocolate
coffee
brown
sugar
and
faint
cinnamon
the
taste
has
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
sweet
roasted
malts
and
some
burnt
malts
up
front
and
orange
in
the
back
ginger
is
apparent
but
is
a
bigger
factor
in
the
finish
where
it
teams
up
with
some
more
orange
notes
hop
addition
is
pretty
substantial
and
make
for
a
terrific
balance
along
side
the
spices
descent
carbonation
maintained
throughout
makes
for
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
cinnamon
notes
pick
up
towards
the
end
ive
always
enjoyed
this
winter
warmer
and
is
one
oldest
ones
that
ive
had
notes
a
well
done
winter
warmer
that
has
a
nice
plesent
warming
at
the
end
of
each
pull
amid
a
complex
malty
spicey
beer
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
find
this
for
the
first
time
even
if
its
only
in
mixed
twelves
keep
it
coming
not
super
complex
but
very
enjoyable
i
wish
there
were
a
couple
more
of
these
in
the
12
pack
good
winter
warmer
one
of
sas
good
ones
this
is
an
enjoyable
winter
seasonal
the
spices
are
a
little
overpowering
for
my
pallet
however
i
would
still
recommend
this
one
taste
is
on
par
with
the
smell
spicy
cinnamon
notes
good
amount
of
malt
sweetness
and
some
citrus
which
im
sure
is
more
from
the
flavoring
than
the
hops
medium
bodied
warm
tasting
and
spicy
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sip
or
drink
normally
on
a
cold
day
the
taste
does
not
let
disappoint
either
sweet
toasted
malts
make
up
the
main
body
of
the
brew
with
hints
of
ginger
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
in
the
background
this
nice
thing
about
this
brew
is
the
accent
flavors
do
not
overpower
they
hit
just
right
dark
brown
body
with
rubyred
highlights
and
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
smells
malty
somewhat
roasty
and
spicy
rich
creamy
and
roasty
has
roasty
chocolate
notes
like
a
porter
but
a
little
lighter
in
flavor
and
body
than
one
medium
to
full
bodied
very
rich
and
tasty
very
tasty
and
drinkable
i
would
definitly
drink
more
of
this
if
i
could
get
it
outside
of
the
winter
samplers
i
havent
had
the
other
brews
yet
excpect
for
the
winter
lager
which
is
great
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
of
these
as
the
weather
gets
cooler
simply
a
great
beer
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
it
was
worth
a
shot
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
highlight
of
this
tasting
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
amazing
subtle
prickliness
on
the
tongues
end
quickly
moves
ahead
and
coats
the
inside
of
the
mouth
it
expands
and
foams
up
impossibly
perfectly
then
finishes
with
a
grace
unlike
anything
ive
seen
for
the
style
wow
big
flavors
moderate
alcohol
strength
sublime
textural
structure
two
big
thumbs
up
for
this
years
sam
adams
old
fezziwig
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
but
full
bodied
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
poured
into
a
glass
look
is
a
reddish
brown
with
heavy
fluffy
thick
head
that
leaves
awesome
lace
to
the
glass
smell
is
of
nuts
and
figs
and
also
some
roasted
malts
as
well
taste
is
a
very
good
balanced
malt
with
hints
of
spice
thrown
in
there
though
the
spice
is
not
over
whelming
this
beer
goes
down
to
smooth
and
it
is
a
very
good
holiday
addition
old
fezziwig
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
nice
thick
head
and
good
lacing
smells
much
like
sams
winter
lager
malty
with
spice
notes
and
some
dried
fruits
etc
taste
is
very
sweet
with
spices
such
as
nutmeg
cinnamon
etc
mouthfeel
is
very
malty
and
carbonated
drinkability
is
very
high
i
will
frequent
this
one
when
i
can
overall
this
beer
works
reading
the
description
on
the
bottle
you
think
theyd
play
it
up
but
you
get
exactly
what
they
advertise
a
great
spiced
malty
ale
thats
great
for
the
cold
nights
definitely
recommended
first
things
first
this
is
a
great
ale
i
poured
it
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
playboy
pint
glass
and
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
magnificant
color
i
really
enjoy
looking
at
a
redish
color
drink
i
have
no
idea
why
immediatly
afterward
i
noticed
the
smell
i
hesitate
to
say
it
knocked
me
over
because
it
was
such
a
pleasant
aroma
but
the
smell
was
extremely
strong
i
didnt
need
to
waft
at
all
just
to
pouring
opened
up
my
nasal
senses
the
least
best
thing
about
this
ale
was
the
mouthfeel
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
it
was
bad
at
all
in
my
opinion
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
something
extra
in
that
department
considering
how
great
everything
else
was
dont
drink
and
review
its
lightly
carbonated
this
was
sampled
out
of
an
imperial
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
clear
deep
redbrown
color
with
creamy
fluffy
light
brown
foam
that
persisted
and
left
lace
the
smell
was
malty
with
notes
of
dark
caramel
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
mollasses
the
taste
was
malty
and
lightly
tangy
with
hints
of
fruit
oranges
and
light
spices
in
the
finish
there
was
low
hop
bitterness
apparent
there
was
a
very
light
memory
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
dry
with
mediumfull
body
and
modest
carbonation
the
finish
and
aftertaste
were
dry
with
spices
lingering
this
was
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
winter
warmer
very
nice
a
nice
copper
color
pours
into
my
pint
glass
i
immediatly
get
the
spicyness
of
the
holidays
in
my
nose
clove
ginger
cinnamon
its
all
there
when
i
drink
this
the
hops
come
out
of
nowhere
didnt
get
it
that
much
in
the
nose
but
theres
some
new
maltyness
to
balance
it
out
as
well
all
of
the
spices
are
there
from
the
nose
but
i
also
get
some
orange
now
it
surprising
how
smooth
it
finishes
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
normally
expect
also
i
could
actually
drink
23
of
these
not
expected
out
of
a
spiced
beer
like
this
poured
a
nice
dark
red
color
with
a
great
head
interesting
maltysweet
and
spicy
aroma
clean
flavor
with
some
roastiness
malt
and
subtle
spice
background
mouthfeel
is
not
too
light
a
nice
beer
that
is
spiced
well
for
the
winter
and
pretty
tasty
i
think
this
would
have
a
bit
higher
drinkability
in
the
winter
right
now
in
may
its
already
almost
90
degrees
it
does
come
off
as
a
bit
of
a
holiday
sweet
ill
try
this
again
in
season
i
enjoy
the
flavor
of
this
beer
a
lot
the
beer
was
malty
with
hints
of
corriander
orange
and
vanilla
it
was
a
nice
thickness
and
had
an
overall
happy
mouthfeel
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
sam
adams
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
if
it
was
available
to
me
eh
i
would
drink
most
any
winter
beer
though
happen
to
like
them
all
a
lot
a
lager
with
initially
fizzy
carbonation
that
fades
as
it
warms
to
just
significant
carbonation
clearly
orange
and
cinammon
a
spot
of
ginger
for
spice
and
caramel
weak
finish
medium
mouthfeel
rather
a
bold
herbal
tea
nice
chestnut
amber
colour
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
ive
had
other
winter
warmers
that
go
overboard
with
the
spice
and
sweetness
this
beer
gets
it
just
right
and
still
maintains
the
sam
adams
signature
pours
a
deep
dark
red
color
with
a
fluffy
tannish
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
spicy
aroma
of
predominantly
cinnamon
with
an
underlying
maltiness
greets
the
nose
first
thing
i
noticed
upon
tasting
was
the
creamy
mouthfeel
followed
by
the
definite
but
not
overwhelming
flavor
of
cinnamon
finishes
with
the
bitterness
of
ginger
lingering
on
the
tongue
no
cloying
sweetness
from
this
brew
which
is
nice
i
could
only
drink
a
couple
of
these
due
to
the
spice
flavor
but
for
a
spice
beer
its
rather
nice
good
looking
beer
first
a
lot
of
head
shrinking
to
a
nice
film
with
tons
o
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
lots
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
and
some
orange
peel
on
top
of
a
slight
malty
base
but
not
much
as
its
hard
to
pick
up
mostly
because
the
cinnamon
is
more
intense
really
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
up
front
then
melts
into
a
smooth
finish
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
warming
surprisingly
i
dont
get
as
much
of
the
cinnamon
in
the
taste
but
get
the
malts
and
ginger
and
i
think
a
trace
of
orange
peel
in
the
middle
maybe
some
raisin
and
maybe
just
maybe
some
hop
in
there
overall
its
an
interesting
mix
of
sweet
and
spicy
and
a
little
bitter
and
it
really
works
quite
well
when
im
taking
a
break
from
drinking
it
i
get
a
lingering
malt
and
ginger
in
my
mouth
drinkability
with
enough
holiday
spices
to
make
it
interesting
but
nothing
over
the
top
this
is
quite
a
decent
winter
warmer
drinkability

it
is
warming
and
tasty
spices
taste
more
natural
than
other
examples
good
for
the
spiced
end
of
the
style
could
use
a
higher
abv
for
more
warming

i
would
buy
a
six
pack
around
the
holidays
but
the
two
in
the
mix
pack
are
just
fine
too
this
beer
is
not
as
dark
thick
or
simple
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
spices
are
good
but
its
missing
the
full
warming
effect
that
i
had
hoped
for
still
its
pretty
solid
and
worthy
enough
to
have
around
the
holidays
even
if
i
dont
get
around
it
until
february
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
with
an
attractive
head
with
foam
islands
good
lacing
throughout
smells
pretty
good
with
spices
like
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
and
there
is
also
some
caramel
maple
and
a
hint
of
citrus
great
christmas
brew
aroma
excuse
me
bouquet
not
bad
if
only
slightly
weak
in
the
nose
the
taste
adds
a
chocolatemousse
dimension
but
again
it
is
slightly
weak
nice
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
depth
in
the
malt
backbone
or
hops
also
the
flavors
mostly
spices
are
solid
in
themselves
but
they
dont
seem
to
quite
come
together
too
well
on
my
palate
has
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
to
it
with
the
hops
making
their
appearance
in
the
after
taste
bringing
a
bitter
fruit
element
to
the
taste
not
bad
but
not
fantastic
either
decent
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
i
guess
somehow
i
cant
see
myself
have
two
or
more
in
one
sitting
though
da
very
good
holiday
brew
could
have
had
56
but
only
two
were
in
the
pack
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
samuel
adams
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
deep
garnetruby
red
with
brighter
red
coloration
nearing
the
edges
of
the
glass
very
minimal
white
head
diminished
to
light
white
lacing
smells
spicy
and
sweet
namely
cinnamon
and
cloves
along
with
notes
of
orangechocolate
and
caramel
tastes
just
as
it
smells
once
the
initial
rush
of
carbonation
allows
the
palate
to
taste
finishes
malty
and
sweet
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
but
once
the
carbonation
falls
off
the
beer
is
slick
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
taste
similar
to
sas
winter
lager
only
less
caramel
and
more
spice
considerably
drinkable
in
the
winter
months
would
likely
purchase
again
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
beer
for
the
time
of
year
not
a
bad
brew
but
just
a
bit
on
the
watery
end
i
am
more
disappointed
that
this
is
only
going
to
be
available
part
of
the
year
and
only
in
the
sample
pack
this
beer
poured
a
dark
burnt
smokey
red
hue
with
a
moderate
tan
head
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
the
aroma
is
delightfully
malty
and
spicy
the
taste
is
malty
followed
by
a
fair
amount
of
spice
and
a
hint
of
orange
at
the
end
the
aftertaste
is
bitterspicy
its
well
balanced
and
medium
bodied
the
mouthfeel
is
very
lively
a
very
good
beer
very
drinkable
this
beer
needs
to
be
available
in
six
packs
instead
of
just
the
winter
mix
12
pack
i
bought
it
in
the
best
samuel
adams
beer
ive
had
hands
down
the
best
by
date
on
the
label
is
notched
as
march
and
the
code
c25250557
is
printed
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
this
brew
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
color
the
head
is
onefinger
in
height
and
creamy
but
it
recededs
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
orange
ginger
and
cinnamon
like
the
bottles
states
but
all
of
the
aromas
are
rather
faint
it
is
a
very
good
aroma
but
it
is
a
lot
harder
to
find
than
it
needs
to
be
for
a
winter
warmer
the
taste
is
of
ginger
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
the
flavor
is
more
pronounced
than
the
aroma
but
still
not
as
full
as
other
winter
warmer
i
have
drank
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
fairly
smooth
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
might
not
be
the
best
winter
warmer
out
there
but
it
is
still
good
and
very
drinkable
cheers
d
well
it
sure
beats
the
cranberry
lambic
i
am
not
too
impressed
by
this
one
it
isnt
an
awful
brew
but
i
will
probably
give
the
other
one
away
not
good
with
food
mouthfeel
and
sweetness
ruin
the
prospect
of
sessioning
the
beer
dark
copper
with
a
decently
firm
offwhite
head
and
persistent
carbonation
nose
of
cinnamon
caramel
citrus
peel
caramelly
malt
flavor
with
cinnamon
and
orange
rind
notes
sturdy
biscuit
malt
middle
with
enough
hop
bite
to
round
out
a
nice
snappy
finish
sparkling
mouthfeel
quenching
nice
drinkability
i
thought
it
to
be
an
ale
analogue
to
their
winter
lager
old
fezziwig
came
exclusively
in
the
12
pack
holiday
sampler
that
i
had
to
hunt
down
by
visiting
three
stores
today
a
merrily
colored
label
reminded
me
of
christmases
past
the
clear
body
was
deep
reddish
amber
in
color
with
an
ample
beige
head
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
the
spices
mentioned
on
the
label
namely
cinnamon
ginger
and
orange
the
taste
was
more
malty
than
spicy
with
toffee
gingerbread
and
cookie
dough
like
sweetness
the
spices
were
lurking
just
in
the
background
and
made
the
palette
dry
as
they
were
detected
creamy
mouthfeel
was
enhanced
by
the
very
soft
carbonation
very
little
hops
detected
except
maybe
with
a
little
floral
flourish
in
the
bouquet
and
a
tiny
hint
of
bitterness
towards
the
end
of
each
swallow
cheerful
easy
to
drink
and
warming
the
spirit
despite
the
relatively
low
abv
i
enjoyed
old
fezziwig
it
is
a
nice
seasonal
holiday
offering
even
the
label
looks
like
a
christmas
card
id
love
to
buy
a
six
or
even
a
twelve
pack
i
hear
they
dont
exist
of
old
fezziwig
ale
ill
look
for
it
early
in
the
next
holiday
season
it
would
make
a
great
host
or
hostess
gift
to
take
to
a
holiday
gathering
this
beer
rocks
it
pisses
me
off
that
i
cant
get
it
in
a
sixer
but
oh
well
yes
this
is
a
legitimate
winter
ale
but
its
a
little
less
overpowering
than
some
others
ive
had
some
purists
may
find
that
to
be
a
problemi
dont
i
love
this
beer
this
is
a
fairly
complex
ale
and
is
therefore
best
if
served
just
slightly
cool
the
appearance
is
really
lovely
it
has
sort
of
a
glowing
redbrown
appearance
that
is
really
inticing
with
some
nice
white
lacing
you
can
really
smell
the
bouqet
of
spices
in
particular
the
cirtus
and
cinammon
really
show
up
along
with
lots
of
malt
aroma
the
taste
follows
suit
the
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
are
pretty
prominent
as
they
should
be
a
twist
of
noble
hops
provides
balance
and
accents
the
sweet
malts
perfectly
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
these
without
thinking
if
i
could
get
more
than
4
at
a
time
d
glad
to
try
it
but
couldnt
see
myself
having
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
if
they
offered
it
in
a
six
pack
id
buy
it
for
a
christmas
party
otherwise
the
two
in
the
mixed
12
are
enough
for
me
a
lot
of
christmas
beers
ive
had
lately
are
real
heavy
on
the
spices
and
i
appreciate
that
this
one
is
a
little
more
subtle
and
balanced
bottom
line
sam
adams
does
it
again
with
a
wonderful
inexpensive
beer
thats
quite
different
from
your
standard
fare
wish
you
could
get
fezziwig
yearround
id
buy
it
for
sure
try
if
you
can
this
is
an
original
and
complex
beer
but
not
one
that
really
appeals
to
my
personal
taste
i
wouldnt
search
it
out
out
in
six
pack
form
but
at
least
its
an
honest
attempt
at
something
different
from
the
brewer
which
is
appreciated
highly
recommended
the
beer
poured
a
nice
christmas
red
with
no
real
head
the
beer
smelled
of
a
nice
warm
spicey
maltiness
fezziwigs
flavor
is
of
a
nice
malty
character
an
almost
brown
sugar
hint
along
with
a
similar
but
understated
spiciness
and
caramel
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
thats
pretty
drinkable
and
refrains
from
being
overly
spiced
but
lacks
much
of
a
hop
presence
a
very
solid
christmaswinter
seasonal
one
i
would
be
even
willing
to
purchase
in
a
6
pack
if
available
sweet
tea
colored
thin
fizzy
head
that
has
better
things
to
do
than
stick
around
in
my
glass
smell
is
more
citrusy
and
orange
than
spicey
taste
is
of
thick
sweet
malt
mild
bitterness
some
cinnamon
and
spice
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
thin
could
be
sessioned
if
you
really
like
this
style
overall
its
ok
but
there
are
better
beers
of
the
style
reminds
me
of
harpoons
winter
warmer
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
nice
sized
head
the
color
is
a
deep
reddish
brown
the
smell
is
of
caramel
the
taste
is
of
caramel
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
i
could
drink
these
but
not
an
everday
drinker
as
far
as
winter
warmers
and
sam
adams
go
the
winter
lager
would
be
a
better
choice
in
my
opinion
i
may
drink
these
again
an
average
beer
body
is
barely
medium
yet
smooth
and
creamy
textured
with
soft
micro
carbonation
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
sweet
meduim
body
very
clean
finish
almost
bone
dry
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
wish
it
was
sold
in
six
packs
or
bombers
got
this
out
of
the
sam
adams
winter
sampler
visually
this
beer
was
gourgeous
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
an
inch
or
so
off
white
head
in
a
standard
pint
glass
smells
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
are
very
profound
and
the
taste
is
what
i
expected
from
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
no
carbonation
i
think
this
a
very
good
beer
but
the
sweetness
would
limit
me
to
one
or
two
overall
i
loved
the
sam
sampler
and
would
like
to
see
something
new
replaced
the
cranberry
lambic
next
year
pours
a
warm
tangerineamber
tone
with
a
finger
of
bubbly
offwhite
head
and
some
decent
lacing
smells
and
tastes
like
christmas
cookies
cinnamon
nutmeg
gingerbread
with
hints
of
corriander
and
a
dash
of
orange
peel
has
a
caramel
sweet
malt
base
that
gives
it
some
heft
mouthfeel
is
lager
slick
matching
the
spice
and
caramel
well
the
spice
and
sweetness
mean
i
could
probably
only
drink
one
or
two
of
these
not
quite
sessionable
but
its
still
a
tasty
winter
warmer
and
welcome
this
time
of
year
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beer
for
hanging
out
and
sippin
on
drinkability
and
notes
may
have
to
write
sam
adams
a
letter
asking
for
a
release
of
this
beer
in
6
packs
during
the
winter
could
easily
sit
around
and
drink
a
few
of
these
in
the
winter
months
a
winter
warmer
with
a
beautiful
use
of
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
at
almost
6
this
does
great
to
warm
you
up
but
wont
hold
you
back
something
i
will
look
forward
to
at
the
first

as
i
find
with
many
sam

brews
its
too
sweet
to
really
drink
a
lot
of
it

the
spices
are
complimentary
and
it
is
pretty
drinkable
i
got
this
in
the
holiday
packwell
duh
and
its
the
main
reason
i
bought
it
because
i
havent
had
it
in
many
years
good
to
see
that
its
still
made
to
be
a
quality
product
smell
is
sweet

and
a
hint

ginger
taste
is

and
a
bit
of

there
are
also
notes
of
that

balance
the

sixers
of
this
it
would
almost
seem
disappointing
not
to
have
to
purchase
the
whole
holiday
mix
pack
old
fezzi
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
almost
purple
highlights
a
large
fluffy
tan
head
forms
eventually
yielding
to
lace
the
aroma
is
very
nice
a
deep
malty
sweetness
evokes
many
sweet
flavors
like
sugar
plums
and
candy
in
the
background
is
nutmeg
andor
cinnamon
the
taste
is
very
sweet
due
to
a
very
strong
malt
base
there
are
candy
flavors
and
fruit
flavors
that
meld
to
create
a
unique
candied
fruit
impression
sugar
plum
fairies
maybe
there
is
some
brown
sugar
towards
the
finish
followed
by
a
slight
bit
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
soft
the
drinkability
is
good
in
the
sense
that
i
love
drinking
the
stuff
but
suffers
somewhat
in
that
i
probably
wouldnt
ever
want
more
than
1
maybe
2
on
a
given
night
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
maybe
the
favorite
beers
and
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
its
a
nice
enough
winter
warmer
but
theres
really
nothing
to
make
it
outstanding
still
its
worth
a
try
i
would
like
to
see
this
in
replacement
of
the
winter
lager
that
they
make
in
seasonal
rotation
i
do
like
the
winter
lager
but
would
prefer
to
see
this
one
in
the
taps
of
bars
as
the
regular
winter
season
brew
for
sam
the
body
is
just
a
little
thin
imo
for
this
to
be
a
great
beer
the
spices
are
smartly
understated
the
hop
character
rightly
low
the
smell
is
wonderful
and
the
taste
is
very
good
a
damn
fine
example
of
a
holiday
beer
and
i
would
drink
a
sixer
of
this
anytime
it
pours
like
a
translucent
porter
and
the
flavor
begin
like
one
too
but
its
much
more
smooth
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
it
ends
clean
not
unlike
a
lager
very
lightly
hopped
just
enough
to
keep
the
malt
in
check
i
dont
get
the
winter
warmer
name
as
it
didnt
make
me
warm
just
drunk
though
its
not
your
typical
beer
as
you
can
drink
it
cold
during
cold
weather
without
feeling
like
an
idiot
anyone
ever
get
this
feeling
its
so
freakin
cold
out
well
time
to
settle
down
with
a
nice
cold
beer
this
would
go
great
with
gingerbread
or
leiberkuchen
sp
will
try
to
find
if
i
can
buy
just
sixer
vice
the
holiday
12
pack
better
than
last
years
vintage
imho
overall
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
i
can
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
just
spicy
enough
good
medium
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
not
strong
enough
to
really
stand
up
to
pumpkin
pie
though
probably
good
with
something
mild
like
ginger
snaps
or
other
holiday
cookies
drinkability
great
very
enjoyable
sa
brew
it
has
been
several
years
since
my
last
old
fezzi
and
i
wont
let
that
happen
again
very
crisp
fruity
and
spicy
nicely
balanced
but
i
can
probably
only
tolorate
a
few
at
a
time
drinkability
with
the
lower
abv
and
the
maltiness
of
this
beer
its
easy
drinking
sa
makes
another
winner
with
this
one
a
pleasant
holiday
treat
decent
head
but
it
descends
rapidly
beer
is
a
nice
amber
color
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
spices
most
dominant
to
me
is
orange
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
smooth
clean
with
some
caramel
and
honey
notes
as
well
as
some
just
plain
sweetness
hops
seem
present
only
for
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
this
isnt
bad
its
interesting
but
kind
of
mild
and
also
not
very
alelike
it
reminds
me
of
a
less
complex
less
strong
belgian
ale
but
overall
i
enjoyed
it
and
wouldnt
mind
buying
a
6
pack
if
im
presented
with
the
option
pours
a
deep
dark
garnetbrunette
hue
and
makes
an
offwhite
head
leaves
a
nice
bit
lacing
down
my
glass
aroma
is
a
hint
of
cinnamon
and
lots
of
roasted
barley
flavor
is
lightly
spiced
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
some
roasted
chocolate
malts
crisply
carbonated
light
to
medium
palate
a
solid
drinker
with
a
clean
dry
finish
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
sam
adams
i
found
it
quite
enjoyable
a
brew
that
i
am
glad
there
are
2
of
in
the
winter
sampler
12
oz
with
purchase
before
march
notched
on
the
label
pours
reddish
with
a
hint
of
red
and
is
a
deep
ruby
in
the
light
the
head
is
about
a
finger
thick
yellowtan
and
leaves
lacing
on
the
glass
from
most
of
the
sips
smells
of
cinnamon
ginger
chocolate
and
orange
along
with
floralgreen
hops
roasted
malts
and
spices
on
the
palate
along
with
some
bitter
chocolate
traces
of
alcohol
and
floral
hops
that
leave
a
mild
to
medium
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
starts
medium
but
thickens
as
it
warms
becoming
smooth
but
retaining
some
of
the
tingly
carbonation
a
good
winter
spice
beer
this
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
very
largethree
finger
headit
really
is
a
nice
looking
beer
the
smell
has
a
little
bit
of
spicesbut
there
also
is
alittle
bit
of
cooked
veggies
its
only
a
little
bitbut
its
there
the
taste
has
a
small
amount
of
the
usual
holiday
spicesbut
i
dont
think
its
overpowering
like
some
reviewers
there
is
a
sweet
maltiness
thats
nicebut
youre
not
bombarded
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
mf
is
a
nice
even
medium
feela
good
distrobution
of
flavor
this
is
an
ok
beernothing
greatbut
not
bad
i
would
just
work
on
the
smell
the
festive
label
really
lets
you
know
this
one
is
gonna
be
fun
to
drink

gotta
find
more
then
again
i
freely
admit
that
i
just
dont
dig
spice
flavours
in
my
beer
if
thats
your
thing
then
youd
most
likely
love
this
beer
enjoy
it
ive
got
one
thatll
be
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
if
you
want
it
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
off
white
head
that
shrinks
quickly
but
never
dissapears
lace
clings
to
side
of
glass
smells
like
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
and
cinnamon
tastes
much
like
it
smells
but
somewhat
spicy
medium
bodied
creamy
this
beer
is
very
filling
for
me
and
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
anymore
than
the
two
offered
in
the
holiday
pack
at
a
time
this
is
the
main
reason
i
purchase
the
holiday
pack
and
i
look
forward
for
its
release
every
year
robust
full
of
character
perhaps
the
perfect
followup
to
the
disappointing
cranberry
lambic
which
also
comes
in
the
samuel
adams
winter
classics
12pack
as
it
will
totally
take
your
mind
off
that
previous
beer
too
bad
you
cant
get
old
fezziwig
seperately
i
would
imagine
it
would
be
a
brisk
seller
this
beer
pours
a
brownish
red
with
a
thick
fluffy
tan
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
lots
of
thick
laces
it
has
a
malty
aroma
i
also
detect
slight
aromas
of
ginger
and
cinnimon
a
slight
hop
presence
is
detectable
this
beer
has
a
spicy
taste
but
not
overly
spicy
it
is
mildly
spicy
it
tastes
really
good
i
taste
cinnimon
and
ginger
maybe
cloves
also
this
beer
has
a
slightly
malty
sweet
taste
i
do
not
taste
any
hop
presence
this
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
leaving
a
spicy
ginger
like
aftertaste
i
think
this
beer
would
make
an
excelent
session
beer
it
has
a
mild
very
good
taste
it
is
not
strong
in
alcohol
so
you
can
drink
a
lot
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
a
shame
that
it
is
only
available
in
a
variety
pack
i
dont
particularly
want
to
have
to
buy
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
winter
lager
and
certainly
not
cranbuerry
lambic
just
to
get
two
of
these
drinkability
and
overall
not
terrible
not
great
its
worth
a
try
put
do
not
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
it
meh
for
me
taste
is
king
in
drinkability
and
here
i
find
myself
not
really
wanting
another
unfortunately
its
a
decent
drinker
and
i
think
itll
go
well
when
it
starts
to
get
colder
but
not
a
favorite
of
mine
brew
pours
to
a
reddish
color
with
a
large
light
tan
head
that
breaks
down
quickly
leaving
nice
lace
rings
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
malt
scents
chocolate
and
caramel
along
with
an
alcohol
like
smell
can
pick
up
some
spices
but
seem
to
be
over
shadowed
but
the
malt
even
with
this
it
is
a
fine
smelling
brew
it
is
in
the
taste
where
i
am
able
to
pick
up
the
spices
at
lease
cinnamon
which
goes
well
with
the
malt
flavors
the
malt
flavors
seem
to
lend
themselves
to
being
more
caramel
than
the
chocolate
that
was
also
picked
up
with
the
nose
over
all
this
is
a
fine
brew
and
a
favorite
for
a
number
of
years
at
the
holidays
very
drinkable
is
it
just
me
or
does
the
chick
on
the
label
look
exactly
like
madonna
this
is
my
first
beer
from
my
first
winter
sampler
pack
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
huge
fluffy
beige
hea
good
retention
nice
lacing
nose
is
fairly
subdued
a
slight
cinammony
malt
faint
citrus
mild
ginger
brown
sugar
taste
is
a
nice
slightly
roasted
malt
a
little
sweet
but
blended
nicely
with
cinammon
and
ginger
spiciness
no
real
hops
here
this
definitely
leans
towards
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
and
carbonation
is
fairly
low
making
for
an
almost
slick
feel
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
not
bad
but
not
really
that
great
excellent
winter
buy
this
one
with
alaskans
and
you
dont
need
much
else
this
season
drinkability
id
be
fine
with
just
this
one
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
i
really
liked
the
smell
and
found
it
to
be
the
most
interesting
aspect
about
this
beer
id
drink
this
again
if
offered
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
specifically
poured
a
deep
dark
amber
colour
with
a
minimal
head
that
dissipated
quickly
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
and
spicy
sweet
malt
flavour
to
start
with
some
citrus
and
spicy
characteristics
finishes
slightly
dry
and
bitter
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
alcohol
level
could
have
been
a
touch
higher
so
that
it
actually
gives
you
a
bit
of
a
winter
warmer
affect
when
you
drink
it
overall
still
quite
drinkable
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
dark
orangered
pour
a
bit
of
a
head
retained
for
a
while
strong
malt
upfront
with
spices
coming
in
afterwards
i
was
afraid
that
the
spices
in
this
beer
would
be
too
overwhelming
but
they
balance
out
perfectly
a
very
nice
tasting
holiday
beer
enjoy
pours
medium
red
with
a
grayish
foamy
head
some
retention
unlike
many
winter
warmers
this
one
actually
has
a
spicy
smell
along
with
chocolates
and
sweet
malts
taste
follows
well
with
a
good
balance
of
semisweetness
chocolate
notes
and
maltiness
slight
bitterness
sticks
around
cinnamon
is
present
as
well
finally
a
drinkable
winter
warmer
that
actually
has
spice
this
one
pours
out
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
hues
and
has
a
decent
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
roasty
and
malty
bits
of
chocolate
surface
in
the
nose
as
for
flavor
the
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
are
nicely
balanced
by
the
beers
hop
presence
there
is
also
a
bit
of
spice
in
there
as
well
its
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
like
most
winter
warmers
i
really
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
12
but
they
are
great
to
sip
sitting
next
to
the
fire
pours
a
ruby
garnet
hue
dark
but
clear
two
finger
head
forms
an
offwhite
cream
and
shows
excellent
retention
but
not
much
lace
wonderful
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
nose
with
some
ginger
and
orange
notes
just
coming
through
malts
taste
sweet
and
toasted
molasses
and
caramel
flavors
with
some
background
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
mild
hops
are
present
just
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
prevent
any
residual
aftertaste
mediumfull
body
and
slow
carbonation
some
spice
and
earthy
tones
will
linger
but
mostly
clean
finish
this
is
a
great
seasonal
with
an
intoxicating
aroma
and
rich
flavors
that
can
produce
some
slight
alcohol
warmth
but
its
smooth
enough
to
polish
off
a
few
interesting
but
not
special
nor
impressive
the
spices
need
to
be
more
fine
tuned
and
the
malts
need
a
more
assertive
character
overall
seems
a
bit
thin
in
the
flavor
department
makes
me
think
of
a
pumpkin
ale
light
on
the
spices
which
is
fine
by
me
easy
drinking
one
of
the
best
in
the
pack
from
the
bottle
poured
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
left
some
lacing
aroma
malts
brown
sugar
toffee
honey
a
nice
sweetness
cinnamon
hints
of
ginger
and
orange
flavor
bitter
malts
sugar
chocolate
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
nice
mouth
feel
would
buy
this
again
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
brew
genuinely
flavorful
without
being
too
rich
or
sugary
while
not
overwhelming
the
orange
flavor
is
as
strong
as
fruit
beer
in
any
event
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
would
probably
go
well
with
a
holiday
dinner
christmas
thanksgiving
etc
especially
with
desert
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
but
not
something
thatll
knock
your
socks
off
an
interesting
beer
though
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
this
one
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
the
winter
lager
well
rounded
and
very
drinkable
i
just
wish
they
could
make
their
brews
more
aromatic
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
the
nose
is
interesting
definately
some
spices
going
on
in
there
wiht
what
i
think
is
some
orange
peel
over
slight
coffee
and
caramel
malt
notes
the
flavor
is
not
all
that
good
i
dont
like
the
spiced
winter
warmers
the
spices
have
almost
an
anise
like
quality
to
it
its
just
not
woking
for
me
the
feel
is
on
the
light
side
of
moderate
overall
the
spicenes
really
takes
away
from
this
beer
i
think
the
malty
base
is
nice
but
it
just
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
a
clean
brown
beer
with
amber
highlights
has
a
small
tight
beige
head
the
aroma
has
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
it
with
a
touch
of
dried
fruit
in
the
background
there
is
a
malty
sweetness
at
the
start
of
the
taste
with
the
spices
coming
in
towards
the
end
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
one
pours
an
amberbrown
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
spicy
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
maybe
a
slight
citrus
the
flavor
is
not
what
i
expected
it
has
a
spicy
character
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
a
hint
of
citrus
very
low
carbonation
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
body
was
lighter
than
id
have
liked
something
about
the
mixture
of
the
spices
in
this
one
just
didnt
appease
to
my
taste
buds
i
dont
know
why
i
found
this
beer
wanting
it
just
didnt
taste
right
to
me
i
like
almost
all
other
sam
beers
and
i
dont
like
to
write
a
less
than
raving
review
on
any
of
them
but
i
am
guided
by
my
concinse
and
taste
it
was
not
a
putred
flavor
it
was
just
a
bit
off
from
what
i
think
it
should
have
been
while
not
a
bad
beer
by
and
definition
i
would
drink
another
sam
over
it
this
12
ounce
bottle
was
notched
buy
before
mar
and
was
sampled
from
a
pint
glass
this
january
the
label
describes
the
cinnamon
ginger
and
orange
used
in
brewing
poured
clear
dark
maplesyrup
with
a
diminuative
ecru
head
that
faded
sooner
than
id
hoped
leaving
only
bits
of
lacing
nose
was
spices
gingerbread
almost
a
pumkinpie
scent
there
somewhere
among
the
dark
malt
it
hits
the
mouth
with
a
smooth
moderate
mouthfeel
velvety
carbonation
tastes
initially
of
sweet
malt
and
spices
overtaken
quickly
by
some
more
astringent
hops
and
spices
while
the
malts
persist
there
underneath
i
like
winter
warmers
but
am
still
trying
to
fit
this

with
a
decent
amount

this
one
seems
to
fit
the
typical
winter
warmer
profile
good
to
middle
of
the
road
winter
sessioner
respectable
take
on
the
style
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
slightly
creamy
texture
works
for
me
i
could
see
myself
having
a
couple
of
these
especially
during
the
holidays
my
fave
sam
adams
brew
as
of
now
why
the
hell
dont
they
put
this
in
sixers
this
slightly
spiced
beer
was
a
pleasant
suprise
it
has
a
little
christmas
flavor
to
it
and
is
usually
a
holiday
staple
for
me
it
is
an
acquired
taste
as
beers
like
guinness
are
but
overall
i
enjoy
it
this
beer
is
not
something
you
can
drink
all
night
but
it
has
a
nice
flavor
after
a
cold
hard
days

than
i
remember
it
being

low
carbonation
a
slick
and
medium
body
gives
a
good
mouthfeel
fullon
sweetness
accompanied
by
cinnamon
and
ginger
spices
with
nary
a
hop
gives
it
a
warming
kind
of
feel
just
complex
enough
for
a
winter
brew
and
something
ill
look
forward
to
next
year
goes
great

lean
and
roasted

show
up
here
and
there

a
nice

mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
winter
brew
i
wouldnt
mind
keeping
a
couple
in
stock
drinkability
a
great
christmas
ale
which
id
recommend
to
anyone
wish
they
made
it
a
bit
more
available
ive
only
seen
it
in
the
holiday
packs
not
in
sixortwelve
packs
by
itself
interesting
beer
pours
a
dark
scarlet
amber
generous
tight
head
that
retains
well
very
sweet
malt
caramel
nose
comes
on
a
bit
surgery
but
has
a
decent
body
of
spice
in
the
back
very
slick
on
the
tongue
creamy
lavender
with
a
tart
sour
finish
medium
hop
body
very
decent
over
all
lingers
a
bit
stale
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
afterwards
but
that
could
have
been
the
two
pots
of
coffee
i
drank
this
morning
all
in
all
a
very
nice
offering
from
the
bbc
certainly
one
of
the
better
wouldnt
be
something
to
spend
all
night
with
but
very
enjoyable
brew
12
ounce
bottle
pours
out
a
dark
brownish
red
the
one
inch
tan
head
doesnt
last
very
long
earthy
aroma
and
noticable
ginger
rich
malty
flavor
heavily
spiced
with
cinnamon
and
ginger
finishes
bitter
medium
mouthfeel
and
an
above
average
drinkability
this
beer
is
interesting
and
i
like
the
use
of
ginger
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
more
than
once
in
a
while
this
one
is
a
dark
clear
copper
with
an
ok
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
the
spice
is
evident
but
far
from
overpowering
theres
also
a
slightly
cheesey
or
mushroomy
smell
that
i
think
may
actually
be
a
trick
of
the
spicemalt
interaction
on
my
nose
instead
of
more
sinister
reasons
the
flavors
a
bit
flat
fairly
dry
with
no
finish
this
is
a
ruby
red
brew
that
poured
a
generous
head
and
is
leaving
a
fine
lacing
down
my
glass
nose
is
picking
up
hints
of
sweet
toasted
malts
and
spices
taste
is
very
good
starts
with
malts
that
are
somewhat
toasted
followed
by
a
wonderful
combination
of
holiday
spices
and
finishes
with
an
ever
slight
dry
hop
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
full
and
is
lively
on
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
nicely
done
holiday
brew
that
i
would
seek
out
again
caramelly
malt
up
front
sweet
but
not
overly
so
spices
dominate
cinnamon
vanilla
zesty
ginger
not
bad
especially
for
something
so
spiced
bitterness
rises
just
before
the
finish
and
sticks
around
with
some
residual
spicy
sweetness
mediumbodied
with
an
almost
creamy
feel
not
something
i
would
drink
often
but
a
good
choice
for
when
i
feel
like
spicing
it
up
haha
pretty
drinkable
for
a
spiced
ale
but
nothing
i
would
probably
seek
out
sam
adams
loves
the
winter
beers
and
this
one
is
a
great
one
to
add
to
the
list
pours
a
cherrywood
color
with
oakness
hues
the
smell
is
of
orange
zest
nutmeg
and
ginger
a
slight
rasin
tone
the
taste
is
a
great
blend
of
spices
and
citrus
with
a
nice
deep
dark
oaked
raisin
taste
medium
bodied
with
great
drinkability
curl
up
with
these
next
to
the
fire
for
a
perfect
winter
night
this
beer
looks
nice
in
the
glass
clear
amber
with
ruby
accents
decent
tan
head
that
holds
pretty
well
good
amount
of
lacing
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
though
is
the
smell
ginger
and
nutmeg
really
come
through
here
with
some
cinnamon
and
apples
in
there
too
some
pleasent
hops
smell
is
drifting
around
very
nice
unfortunately
i
cant
really
taste
much
of
that
theres
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
hops
but
nothing
else
seems
to
be
going
on
the
beer
feels
very
thin
too
just
not
much
to
it
it
doesnt
taste
bad
just
not
a
lot
of
complexity
on
the
plus
side
the
drinkability
is
great
smell
of
malt
with
raisin
and
decent
hop
aroma
fruity
taste
is
quite
nice
chocoate
malt
notes
with
raisin
ginger
and
slight
orange
flavors
balanced
with
just
enough
hops
to
offset
the
sweetness
some
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
much
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
a
nice
bitter
roasted
aftertaste
decent
drinkability
not
a
bunch
and
not
something
to
have
in
the
summer
but
great
around
this
time
of
year
this
beer
has
an
enviable
balance
to
it
it
is
drinkable
while
providing
some
hints
of
special
holiday
flavors
a
well
crafted
spiced
beer
but
not
of
my
personal
preference
final
thought
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
so
i
like
it
on
that
basis
however
its
not
that
great
of
a
beer
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
the
mid
90s
but
i
guess
my
tastes
have
changed
since
then
its
not
bad
but
not
very
interesting
bringing
the
spices
out
would
help
a
lot
the
taste
is
mellow
a
nice
blend
of
spices
but
not
able
to
tell
what
the
underlying
stule
is
supposed
to
be
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
seems
more
so
as
the
beer
spices
dry
out
the
palate
hop
flavor
none
the
spices
do
not
overwhelm
amking
this
a
holiday
beer
i
could
drink
alot
of
abv
is
not
detectable
at
all
third
beer
of
the
evening
an
aggressive
pour
into
my
sam
smith
pint
yields
a
quickly
disappating
1
finger
slightly
off
white
head
atop
a
dark
ruby
body
carbonation
is
subdued
smells
great
strong
notes
of
spice
mingle
with
sweet
malts
taste
is
very
well
balanced
spice
and
a
very
distinct
nuttiness
comes
through
at
the
end
finish
reminds
me
of
walnuts
actually
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
in
my
opinion
but
otherwise
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
perhaps
my
second
favorite
sam
adams
after
their
cream
stout
nice
mouthfeel
but
its
a
bit
too
spicy
to
drink
too
many
of
these
this
was
a
little
bit
of
a
disapointment
after
sas
excellent
holiday
porter
still
fezziwig
is
enjoyable
and
one
of
sas
better
brews
color
is
dark
ruby
short
head
aroma
is
malty
with
a
touch
of
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
touted
on
the
bottle
taste
starts
with
dark
bready
malts
finish
is
ginger
and
cinnamon
which
linger
on
the
palate
a
little
too
long
a
slight
roasted
taste
is
in
the
finish
too
this
is
pretty
good
but
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
i
like
this
as
a
part
of
a
sample
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
a
sixer
of
it
this
is
not
something
i
really
enjoy
i
only
have
one
other
winter
warmer
to
compare
this
to
but
i
think
i
would
pick
jubelale
over
this
if
both
were
in
sixers
next
to
each
other
hints
of
chocolate
along
with
roasted
toasted
malt
make
for
a
sweet
start
the
spices
come
in
with
plenty
of

is
a

12pack
so
you
get
only
two
bottles
i
would
buy
multiple
6packs
of
this
if
it
was
marketed
by
itself
but
marketing
includes
some
boring
brews
in
the
12pack
so
will
only
buy
one
83
for
a
12oz

aroma
displays
strong
notes
of
complex
malts
cinnamon

taste
is
less
complex
and
distinguished
than
the
smell
would
suggest
but
still
very
good
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
due
some
unexpected
carbonation
not
overly
thin
but
enough
to
warrant
a
slightly
lower
score
in
my
opinion
not
something
you
would
want
to
kick
back
a
ton
of
but
the
style
doesnt
lend
itself
to
this
kind
of
consumption
compared
entirely
against
the
style
its
a
very
drinkable
offering
just
now
perused
the
label
and
im
thinking
yeah
now
i
can
taste
the
orange
sure
this
is
spicy
holiday
brew
from
sam
adams
that
i
look
foward
to
seeing
every
season
a
solid
piece
to
the
winter
classics
12
pack
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
along
the
edges
medium
slightly
fizzy
tan
head
smell
is
of
maple
syrup
and
caramel
ice
cream
really
nice
taste
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
aroma
but
its
good
nonetheless
theres
a
lot
of
sweet
maltiness
upfront
the
top
middling
and
the
finish
is
slightly
citric
and
spicy
the
malts
have
trouble
distinguishing
themselves
theres
a
chocolate
aspect
in
there
that
kind
of
muddles
the
flavors
the
spices
are
the
same
way
i
cant
really
discern
each
spice
but
rather
taste
a
generally
spice
flavor
there
is
a
citric
tartness
at
the
end
but
the
beer
finishes
with
a
hoppy
spiciness
and
slight
dryness
i
think
id
be
satisfied
with
about
2
of
these
but
i
liked
it
nonetheless
also
it
seemed
to
improve
as
it
warmed
very
good
comparable
to
the
winter
lager
i
had
the
night
before
but
i
think
i
like
the
winter
lager
a
bit
better
the
flavors
are
more
pronounced
in
it
this
is
a
sam
adams
beer
that
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
but
never
got
around
to
buying
because
it
only
comes
in
the
holiday
sampler
it
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
and
has
a
tan
and
white
head
that
did
not
stick
around
for
very
long
but
did
leave
nice
lacing
it
smells
malty
and
like
raisins
and
cinnamon
and
a
hint
of
ginger
the
flavor
is
every
bit
complexraisins
caramelgingercinnamon
and
nice
mix
of
hops
at
the
end
but
is
smooth
and
perfectly
blended
this
is
the
best
holiday
spiced
beer
i
have
ever
tried
and
is
the
only
one
i
will
look
forward
to
enjoying
for
a
second
time
or
in
this
case
many
more
pours
a
mediumdark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
small
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
a
persistent
foam
ring
a
little
bit
of
lacing
maltysweet
aroma
with
little
hint
of
the
spices
spice
is
apparent
upfront
in
the
taste
however
spice
flavors
are
muddled
however
not
distinct
not
that
that
is
necessarily
bad
you
do
occasionally
get
a
little
hint
of
cinnamon
or
ginger
after
the
spice
you
taste
some
coffee
notes
and
sweet
carmel
malts
minimal
hop
flavor
mediumbodied
with
low
carbonation
pretty
good
overall
kind
of
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
it
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
however
clear
medium
brown
pour
with
very
light
color
and
size
head
small
amount
of
lacing
left
behind
not
a
very
strong
aroma
from
this
one
seems
that
the
last
was
stronger
but
i
forgot
to
review
it
then
i
do
catch
some
darkdry
fruit
raisin
and
some
back
of
the
mouth
spice
like
ginger
taste
is
pretty
complex
and
i
am
having
trouble
defining
which
flavors
are
which
though
this
is
usually
a
good
thing
because
they
flavors
alternate
and
complement
each
other
this
time
everything
just
gets
jumbled
i
dont
think
this
really
stands
up
to
the
winter
warmer
category
but
appreciate
it
as
a
better
than
average
beer
oelergud
the
aroma
is
coffee
like
and
cola
like
at
the
same
time
indicating
a
nice
blend
of
malts
the
taste
is
very
good
with
a
background
of
coffee
and
blended
malts
there
is
also
a
hint
of
a
strong
tea
there
is
also
a
nice
spiciness
too
very
good
merry
christmas
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
again
sam
adams
surprises
me
with
this
spicy
rich
caramel
ale
wonderful
aftertaste
and
overall
great
beer
along
with
the
cream
stout
this
ale
should
liven
up
your
winter
i
wish
i
was
able
to
get
it
year
round
easily
a
copperyred
beer
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
i
poured
one
into
a
cutglass
tumbler
and
it
really
looked
classy
taste
is
on
the
light
side
with
just
a
hint
of
fruits
and
spices
making
this
an
ideal
beer
to
have
with
thanksgiving
or
christmas
dinner
you
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
every
day
but
as
a
holiday
treat
its
a
definite
contender
fezziwig
pours
a
very
red
colour
nice
single
finger
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
decent
lacing
the
smell
to
me
reminded
me
a
toasted
almonds
i
do
not
know
why
it
just
smelled
like
almonds
had
a
toastedroasted
smell
to
it
the
taste
was
very
complex
but
there
is
definite
spice
in
there
and
a
little
bit
more
hops
than
i
was
anticipating
which
it
hurt
its
rating
as
i
do
not
care
for
hoppy
beerale
nice
full
body
a
bit
heavy
quite
nice
thick
brown
color
medium
head
head
has
a
brownalmond
hue
citrus
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
chocolate
strong
roasted
malt
flavor
however
it
rests
softly
on
the
palate
and
finishes
with
a
tangy
slightly
spicy
aftertaste
very
well
balanced
ale
in
the
future
i
hope
jim
decides
to
sell
it
in
six
packs
and
not
just
part
of
a
sampler
i
first
had
this
one
when
they
had
it
available
in
larger
bottles
individually
i
wish
theyd
offer
it
by
itself
again
this
one
makes
it
worth
buying
the
multipack
though
very
malty
with
definite
orange
flavors
and
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
well
balanced
and
goes
down
smooth
i
wish
they
sold
this
in
six
packs
rather
than
forcing
us
to
purchase
a
sampler
and
only
get
two
of
these
the
fezziwig
name
couldnt
be
more
appropriate
for
such
a
rich
and
lively
ale
its
reddishchestnut
body
displays
glowing
ruby
highlights
and
its
creamy
ivory
head
holds
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
about
the
glass
rich
caramelsoaked
and
hopinfused
malt
dominates
the
nose
beckoning
you
to
take
another
whiff
where
subtle
spicing
may
be
found
in
the
mouth
its
fine
median
carbonation
gently
zests
on
the
tongue
before
warming
to
become
just
slightly
creamy
the
spicing
is
far
from
overdone
and
simply
lends
a
bit
of
extra
character
and
depth
to
an
already
rich
brew
deeply
caramelized
malts
abound
and
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
helps
to
anchor
it
although
thats
where
the
hops
come
into
play
much
like
the
spicing
they
play
a
supporting
role
but
a
full
on
at
that
the
bitterness
is
firm
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
but
never
surpasses
that
function
and
the
grassy
and
floral
hop
flavors
help
to
thin
the
richness
of
the
malt
so
that
it
doesnt
appear
as
sweet
but
i
wouldnt
seek
out
another
one
in
this
condition
will
definitely
try
to
get
a
newer
sample
this
winter

just

the

reminds
me
exactly
of
past
versions

lager
a
brew
ive
always
enjoyed
but
i
expected
this
to
be
heartier

would
have
raised

the

the

is
fezziwig
worth
buying
the
winter

set
for
two
bottles
that
is
very
debatable
id
say
no
yet
i
buy
it
every
year
it
is
plenty
enjoyable
to
quaff
a
maltier
backbone
would
really
elevate
this
beer
a
solid
offering
geared
for
a
less
adventurous
beer
drinker
this
works
great
for
the
winter
the
spices
warm
you
up
and
the
crispness
keeps
you
wanting
more
i
enjoy
this
a
little
more
than
their
winter
lager
the
taste
is
a
little
more
complex
and
the
brew
is
a
little
heavier
ginger
flavors
are
predominate
with
less
strong

im
still
a
fan
of
sam
adams
even
if
they
are
heading
too
mainstream
for

their
beer
still
tastes
just
as
good
to
me
and
unless
they
get
ruthless
in
their
business
practices
like
ab
ill
never
say
anything

sam
adams
beers
almost
always
do
great
in
the
appearance
and
head
retention
department
what
an
aroma
ginger
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
are
all
present
along
with
sweet
malt
caramel
mostly
some
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
toasted
character
more
intense
spice
aroma
than
winter
lager
but
a
bit
similar
because
of
the
spices
used
the
three
spices
are
the
mainstay
of
the
palate
as
well
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
mostly
but
ginger
isnt
far
behind
more
toasted
and
chocolate
malt
backing
them
up
with
a
little
less
caramel
than
i
expected
having
noted
the
aroma
but
still
a
generous
amount
coats
the
tongue
in
spicy
caramel
sweetness
a
bit
of
a
warming
alcohol
presence
rich

a
great

beer
thats
perfect
for

i
really
wish
these
were
available
in
six
packs
however
im
just
happy
that
they
keep
putting
this
beer
out
at
all
there
being
so
many
sam

beers
that
are
no
longer
produced
id
recommend
drinking
one
on

i
really
wish
this

was

round
as
it
is
sammys
best
offering
edging
out
the
winter

i
really
had
trouble
placing
the
aroma
it
was
kind
of
like
toasted
wheat
bread
with
a
hint
of
orange
the
color
was
rich
and
so
was
the
taste

complex

i
wish
they
sold
these
in
6

are

but
this
is
near
the
top
of
the
list

opinion

this
is
damn
good

seasonal
imo
balanced
to
perfection
given
everything
that
is
going
on
i
just
love
this
beer
and
miss
it
dearly
on
its
own
they
should
bring
this
back
in
6pak
form
or
just
bottle
a
few
cases
of
bombers
for
me
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
not
a
fan
but
it
grew
on
me
of
course
the
last
time
i
had
it
i
had
the
christmas
carols
jamming
a
santa
hat
on
my
head
and
my
3
year
old
kid
and
i
were
decking
the
tree
so
you
could
say
the
mood
enhanced
my
liking
of
this
beer
some

hints
come
through
a
nice
holiday
offering
a
dark

color
with
a

head
almost
a

flavour
i
had
it
with
a
piece
of
pumkin
pie
and
the
two
went
perfect
together
with
all
the
attention
this
beer
seems
to
be
getting
i
decided
to
go
and
buy
the
sas
winter
12
pack
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
winter
brew
heavy
on
the
dark
malt
but
with
enough
spices
and
draw
attention
warms
nicely
a
very
interesting
holiday
season
brew
cant
believe
i
had
to
buy
a
12
pack
of
mixed
beers
to
try
this
id
buy
a
ton
if
i
could
wonderful
color
spicy
and
great
mouthfeel
i
only
got
two
this
beer
could
get
expensive
worth
the
effort
not
sure
about
the
price
limited
in
supply
last
brewed
i
believe
in
1997
its
only
available
in
the
winter
classics
12pak
beer
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
the
taste
isnt
very
complex
and
its
a
bit
too
light
in
taste
to
justify
its
strength
in
both
color
and
smell
tastes
very
ordinary
in
my
opinion
my
favorite
winter
warmer
excellent
beer
o
keep
away
from
this
one
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
wine
world
and
spirits
in
north
seattle
o
a
very
sweet
pleasant
enough
christmas
ale
a
little
one
dimensional
nice
but
nothing
special
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
perhaps
lacking
in
the
complexity
department
but
enjoyable
enough
for
a
cold
november
evening
o
pumped
i
got
to
try
it
an
excellent
seasonal
beer
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
if
i
have
a
few
of
these
i
wont
be
doing
much
else
that
day
coats
the
mouth
good
the
velvety
smoothness
comes
to
mind
first
very
impressive
it
manages
to
be
sweet
but
not
sticky
with
some
toast
and
toffee
to
go
along
with
a
mild
floral
hop
bitterness
it
has
some
sherry
notes
usually
found
in
a
nice
aged
barleywine
i
like
how
it
straddles
the
line
between
sweet
and
toasty
never
really
leaning
one
way
or
the
other
fun
beer
id
put
at
least
a
few
of
these
away
each
year
come
wintertime
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
quaff
after
a
long
day
on
the
slopes
o
always
a
winter
beer
fav
bottom
line
drink
this
one
with
care
this
has
been
only
beer
where
after
a
mere
6
pk
i
found
myself
the
next
morning
face
down
next
to
the
fridge
and
late
for
work
so
take
caution
this
one
can
get
you
in
the
woowoo
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
texture
and
lively
carbonation
has
a
long
lingering

id
want
to
drink
any

time
or
any

place
than
in
the
nw
during
winter
however
drinking
this
beer
in
tacoma
in

is
just
an
absolute
treat
but
one
ill
probably
have
to
wait
another
year
for
to
sample
again
mouthfeel
is

a

overall
im
pretty
impressed
its
nice
its
a
solid
beer
and
i
wonder
what
a
fresh
2011
release
would
taste
like
perhaps
more
bitter
and
hoppy
but
this
cellared
number
seems
nice
and
smooth
and
certainly
has
some
nice
character
in
its
malt
and
spice
o
not
impressed
one
bit
was
looking
forward
to
a
local
brew
and
shouldnt
have
grabbed
this
dont
know
if
ill
finish
it
or
not
here
in
washington
its
a
few
bucks
more
than
most
winter
warmers
but
its
also
the
best
one
around
overall
this
seemed
like
a
run
of
the
mill
amber
ale
with
hints
of
darker
malts
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
worth
seeking
out
either
d
this
recipe
should
be
tossed
out
of
the
lexicon
for
what
is
normally
a
great
brewery
first
had
this
on
tap
but
grading
from
a
bottle
appearance
is
a
dark
ruby
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
and
nill
lace
smell
has
a
rich
malt
dark
fruit
aroma
with
a
little
alchohol
lingering
taste
has
again
very
rich
malts
and
fruits
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
with
a
little
alchohol
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
good
carbonation
a
nice
heavy
christmas
ale
that
is
satisfying
to
sip
on
single
bottle
picked
up
to
give
it
a
try
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
orange
color
lots
of
carbonation
noted
with
some
lacing
smell
had
a
lots
of
hops
to
it
taste
was
also
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
citrus
also
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
bitter
did
not
realize
the
abv
was
that
high
too
hoppy
for
a
winter
warmer
for
my
liking
would
be
a
good
choice
though
for
ipa
lovers
d
the
lingering
bready
bitterness
keep
it
from
being
overly
drinkable
to
be
honest
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
certainly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
d
a
bit
hot
right
now
at
8
you
really
taste
the
booze
as
it
leaves
a
little
burning
in
the
cheeks
and
back
of
the
throat
after
the
finish
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
id
love
this
but
i
think
this
could
really
benefit
from
age
great
for
the
style
and
i
regret
not
cellaring
some
of
this
when
i
lived
in
seattle
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
an
easy
sipper
with
a
gently
warming
alcohol
presence
one
of
the
finest
winter
ales
washington
has
to
offer
drinkabilityhigh
abv
limits
drinkability
but
the
deliciousness
boosts
it
too
brilliantly
huge
overall
a
very
solid
winter
warmer
which
i
must
say
is
hitting
the
spot
perfectly
after
fittingly
enough
a
snowy
day
good
thing
this
stuff
is
local
ill
probably
be
having
a
bit
more
of
it
while
its
around
i
just
couldnt
wait
for
xmas
i
would
recommend
it
if
for
nothing
more
than
a
history
lesson
to
other
northwesterners
to
let
them
know
that
theres
more
than
just
what
we
normally
see
out
there
in
the
beer
world
drinkability
is
decent
but
with
the
somewhat
boring
nosetaste
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
pretty
drinkable
abv
is
well
hidden
not
bad
not
mind
blowing
either
the
body
was
very
good
full
and
thick
without
being
heavy
a
nice
taste
lingers
on
the
tongue
and
extends
the
enjoyment
drinkability
is
also
very
good
but
caution
must
be
used
due
to
the
strength
of
this
tasty
brew
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
look
forward
to
its
release
every
year
cheers
beertracker
poured
a
caramel
color
a
cloudier
on
tap
and
seems
to
be
much
heavier
nose
is
sweet
and
pretty
malty
taste
is
nice
and
spicy
but
goes
down
so
smooth
hops
amd
malt
are
perfect
well
balanced
notice
a
little
spice
but
its
all
nice
and
this
is
why
the
maritime
has
it
right
on
everything
good
interesting
solid
brew
tasty
and
hugely
britishesque
warming
and
malty
and
i
could
see
several
of
these
sneaking
up
on
you
easily
d
i
liked
this
beer
overall
and
would
have
it
again
i
wished
that
it
had
a
more
enticing
aroma
but
its
otherwise
a
good
drinkable
warmer
worth
a
try
not
very
drinkable
have
to
be
honest
on
a
friday
evening
im
not
going
to
waste
my
time
with
this
beer
moving
on
you
should
too
drinkability
is
not
to
high
this
was
a
subpar
beer
and
im
not
impressed
less
fusels
and
more
maltiness
or
basically
any
other
character
and
they
might
have
pulled
it
off
but
as
it
stands
i
really
dont
see
much
of
a
leg
to
stand
on
not
a
bad
beer
tastes
and
smells
like
a
barleywine
but
much
hoppier
not
a
bad
beer
but
thick
and
powerful
to
dry
and
drink
more
than
one
drinkability
not
good
at
all
i
possibly
got
a
bad
bottle
d
a
nice

drinkability
a
solid
winter
warmer
perhaps
with
a
little
too
much
reliance
on
herbal
hops
to
achieve
what
it
wants
but
nonetheless
pretty
decent
m
d
easy
does
it
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
on
the
hefty
side
medium
body
minimal
carbonation
not
one
of
my
favourites
but
glad
to
have
tried
it
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
d
this
is
a
quality
winter
warmer
and
almost
drinks
like
a
barley
wine
for
the
price
i
could
see
myself
with
a
case
of
this
as
a
staple
through
the
2008
holiday
season
jk
overall
worth
a
try
but
not
high
on
my
list
of
wonderful
christmas
beers
im
willing
to
concede
that
i
have
something
of
a
personal
attachment
to
this
beer
that
may
color
my
perceptions
after
spending
as
many
holiday
seasons
with
jr
as
i
have
ive
grown
to
expect
that
it
just
wouldnt
be
winter
without
it
ive
got
an
almost
childlike
emotional
attachment
to
it
that
i
cant
separate
from
the
experience
of
christmas
itself
you
know
like
visions
of
sugarplums
danced
in
their
heads
that
sort
of
thing
only
now
that
im
all
grown
up
it
aint
sugarplums
its
big
winter
ales
like
this
one
overall
a
complex
and
unique
winter
warmer
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
however
thanks
mikeale
for
the
opportunity
thanks
to
matt
k
for
bringing
this
one
back
from
seattle
its
a
hazy
orange
in
my
glass
with
little
head
or
lacing
basically
its
a
red
ale
with
decent
hops
to
it
i
also
get
some
very
slight
cocoa
along
with
the
smooth
and
roasted
caramel
flavors
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
new
or
inspiring
overall
like
a
minibarley
wine
tons
of
flavor
and
great
aroma
paired
with
medium
strength
alcohol
and
a
mouthfeel
to
die
for
great
great
beer
from
a
brewery
i
had
never
heard
of
until
tonight
thanks
to
svejk
for
the
hook
up
d
definitely
not
a
session
one
will
do
fine
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
reviewed
on
this
site
most
likely
because
it
is
the
absolute
best
winter
brew
i
have
ever
had
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
another
6pak
of
this
also
tried
an
avalanche
by
snoqualmie
brewery
earlier
this
week
also
good
but
not
this
good
nice
heavy
mouthfeel
thick
and
creamy
and
very
nice
on
a
chilly
night
pours
a
murky
caramel
color
with
a
ruby
hue
couple
fingers
of
cream
colored
head
after
an
aggressive
pour
that
died
slow
and
leaves
sticky
sheets
of
lace
smells
of
sherry
fig
plum
molassas
a
little
spice
very
sweet
big
flavors
sherry
type
alcohol
is
predominant
with
a
backbone
of
caramel
cinnimon
fig
and
dried
plum
feels
full
in
the
mouth
with
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
resembles
a
barleywine
a
sipper
for
sure
a
nice
treat
but
probably
be
even
better
on
a
snowy
winter
day
hence
winter
warmer
it
was
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
beertoo
bad
i
didnt
save
a
second
bottle
edit
another
bottle
purchased
the
same
time
as
the
last
but
consumed
about
a
month
later
was
awesome
it
seems
like
every
other
serving
i
have
of
this
beer
is
great
very
weird
medium
mouthfeel
boardering
on
medlarge
get
a
bit
chewy
as
the
beer
warms
up
mild
carbonation
very
drinkable
wow
had
this
with
dinner
at
a
steakhouse
in
downtown
seattle
this
could
have
been
a
meal
in
and
of
itself
after
two
before
dinner
came
i
was
feeling
it
i
hadnt
eaten
anything
all
day
but
i
was
still
a
little
surprised
at
how
it
hit
me
it
wasnt
until
i
got
home
and
looked
it
up
and
found
that
the
alcohol
content
was
9
that
it
all
made
sense
anyway
on
to
the
beer
great
color
and
smell
i
couldnt
wait
to
jump
right
in
lots
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
great
full
bodied
caramel
flavor
the
first
one
went
down
so
easily
i
hardly
remembered
the
transition
into
the
second
at
9
its
definitely
not
for
the
weak
hearted
and
being
a
winter
brew
this
will
keep
you
warm
on
the
cold
damp
nights
in
the
pacific
northwest
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
the
alcohol
is
very
much
at
the
forefront
and
the
drink
has
a
rummy
character
to
it
i
can
definitely
feel
a
burn
with
every
swallow
it
is
a
mediumhigh
abv
that
drinks
like
a
very
high
abv
and
for
that
reason
i
cant
score
it
too
high
on
drinkability
good
offering
nonetheless
this
one
is
not
real
sessionable
it
would
be
worth
having
a
couple
but
thats
all
its
kind
of
strong
tasting
and
the
abv
is
a
little
high
not
the
most
drinkable
brew
d
perfect
brew
for
a
rainy
chilly
seattle
evening
good
winter
warmer
overall
an
awesome
beer
and
im
struggling
to
remember
a
better
example
of
the
style
ill
bee
seeking
out
more
to
drink
now
and
some
to
putdown
for
a
bit
ill
bet
this
ages
into
something
fiercely
delicious
this
is
a
good
beer
from
a
good
brewery
its
somewhat
peculiar
to
me
its
only
been
reviewed
30
times
as
of
the
writing
of
this
as
its
a
perennial
local
favorite
jolly
roger
is
a
redbrown
brew
with
lighttoaverage
retention
of
its
offwhite
head
the
retention
is
impressive
considering
the
higher
alcohol
content
there
is
a
spicy
hop
aroma
and
the
taste
is
complex
with
caramel
herbal
and
slightly
medicinal
tastes
as
well
as
some
raisiny
toasty
flavor
with
a
toffee
note
there
is
a
mediumlong
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
sharpy
carbonated
the
8
alcohol
content
is
detectable
as
warmth
a
good
drinkable
winter
warmer
thanks
again
to
skyhand
especially
thanks
for
two
bottles
i
will
love
the
second
even
more
than
the
first
since
i
will
do
so
merely
for
pleasure
and
not
to
review
palate
is
a
complex
blend
of
piney
hops
that
are
somewhat
subdued
by
the
lightly
sweet
sticky
malt
the
bitterness
comes
through
on
the
finish
with
a
good
bit
of
spruce
emerging
on
the
aftertaste
body
is
smooth
and
more
than
a
little
creamy
an
unexpected
pleasure
in
a
winter
warmer
the
ample
alcohol
makes
this
one
youll
probably
want
to
drink
in
moderation
but
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
ill
have
to
explore
more
of
this
brewerys
offerings
next
time
im
in
seattle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
tan
head
over
the
almost
clear
orangey
amber
brew
head
is
quickly
down
to
a
swirly
layer
of
itty
bitty
bubbles
and
lacing
is
average
aroma
is
a
bit
syrupy
with
piney
hop
notes
taste
is
intense
upfront
with
everything
coming
at
once
the
sweetness
and
hops
are
both
right
there
and
the
rest
of
the
experience
is
the
tsunami
roiling
and
the
receding
mouthfeel
is
nice
once
things
settle
down
and
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
the
style
and
the
abv
a
winter
warmer
i
wouldnt
mind
wintering
with
this
is
the
first
sixpack
of
a
beer
ive
bought
in
months
usually
i
buy
one
bottle
of
several
types
of
beer
returning
to
one
rarely
if
i
know
its
good
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
the
other
day
after
trying
one
bottle
a
week
ago
it
saddens
me
to
learn
of
this
beer
so
soon
to
the
end
of
its
run
definitely
gives
me
something
to
look
forward
to
next
winter
this
stuff
is
brewed
under
the
ballard
bridge
and
literally
flies
off
the
shelves
each
year
in
the
emerald
city
and
surrounding
environs
for
good
reason
lovely
turbid
pour
yeilding
an
amber
with
a
slight
tan
head
the
smell
is
muted
like
i
am
smelling
a
candle
in
the
next
room
some
fruit
esters
and
sweet
maltiness
with
lingering
hop
characters
the
taste
is
very
good
but
i
am
sure
different
than
fresh
the
hop
presence
is
grassy
but
most
only
bittering
the
malt
dominates
and
that
is
alright
because
this
tastes
somewhat
like
belgian
yeast
was
put
to
work
fruity
cherry
and
currants
delicately
hide
around
the
corner
while
a
yeast
flavor
hangs
out
with
the
malt
like
brown
sugar
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
wish
i
had
plenty
fresh
and
aged
drinkability
must
be
very
good
as
im
looking
forward
to
gobbling
the
other
5
this
evening
pours
a
deep
coppery
amber
with
absolute
minimal
head
aroma
is
none
too
light
on
its
feet
but
hints
at
supreme
maltiness
upfront
theres
a
few
fruity
esters
then
lots
of
malty
bready
brown
sugar
sweetness
though
by
no
means
overkill
just
enough
intermixed
is
lots
more
fruitiness
definite
cherries
banana
and
spice
i
wont
hazard
a
guess
as
to
which
just
enough
hops
to
balance
its
very
full
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
medium
low
carbonation
runs
all
around
the
palate
well
after
swallowing
drinks
like
a
beauty
simply
marvelous
semisticky
and
cloying
with
malty
sweet
action
and
silky
smoothness
body
is
mediumish
with
a
light
carbonation
that
tends
to
build
slightly
into
the
finish
nice
little
warming
hints
gradually
gain
hold
as
you
go
a
nice
beer
perfect
for
helping
warm
up
the
winter
i
really
couldnt
finish
this
one
a
little
diacetyl
can
add
a
hint
of
richness
or
depth
but
too
much
and
it
stops
tasting
like
beer
and
instead
is
like
liquid
popcorn
pours
a
dark
redbrown
a
perfect
color
for
late
autumn
early
winter
especially
since
it
seems
extra
cold
this
seattle
winter
i
dont
even
need
to
try
i
can
smell
rich
diacetyl
and
caramel
with
some
fruit
lurking
just
beneath
the
surface
i
never
would
have
said
it
the
first
time
i
tried
this
but
all
i
can
think
of
is
an
english
esb
on
steroids
which
to
me
is
a
good
thing
as
i
love
english
beers
the
taste
is
more
caramel
with
hints
of
diacetyl
and
muted
fruit
almost
a
pear
taste
mouthfeel
is
every
bit
as
great
as
a
beer
straight
from
london
if
you
impulsively
grabbed
a
sixer
of
this
you
wont
be
sad
that
after
drinking
one
youll
still
have
5
more
to
go
this
beer
is
defintely
a
winner
thank
you
maritime
for
being
creative
in
your
brewing
and
giving
me
something
to
think
about
cheers
the
8
0
abv
is
beginning
to
scimitar
my
ass
so
ill
end
this
thing
while
i
can
still
type
a
big
thank
you
to
the
right
honorable
royalt
for
this
growler
and
the
two
that
preceded
it
if
i
can
manage
to
find
the
bottom
tonight
i
will
not
have
had
a
finer
192
consecutive
ounces
of
beer
in
my
entire
life
sugar
cookie
dough
bubblegum
boiled
collards
and
dandelion
greens
chewy
lots
of
malt
liquor
like
cooking
greens
in
a
malt
broth
burnt
sugar
cookies
and
spice
nodules
its
like
pingpingping
on
the
spice
jar
lids
drinkability
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
perhaps
not
i
dont
really
want
another
bottle
of
this
beer
the
flavor
needs
to
be
refined
to
and
i
just
dont
see
it
happening
from
this
beer
my
advice
would
be
to
toss
this
recipe
and
start
over
slàinte
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
head
held
up
to
the
light
wasnt
quite
crystal
clear
but
a
little
hazy
aroma
is
malty
and
estery
nothing
to
write
home
about
taste
is
big
and
malty
sweet
yet
perfectly
balanced
with
citrusy
hops
nice
syurpy
body
yet
quite
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
pours
a
pune
juice
color
with
dark
streaks
the
head
was
tan
and
delicious
looking
smell
was
of
deep
roasted
oak
and
nuts
metallic
hint
a
ground
almost
grassy
hint
the
taste
just
didnt
seem
right
i
might
have
to
give
this

another
try
almost
a

thanks
go
again
to
the
mighty
weefisheads
for
this
update

the
04
seasonal
was
a

bitterer
at
the
finish
then
it
was
in
03
and
maybe
a

lighter

if

was
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
otherwise
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
much
more
belgian
than
english
than
i
was
expecting
great
notes
of
fruit
and
spice
an
old
favorite
in
the
ski
lodge
but
not
particularly
amazing
sweet
malty
some
chocolate
solid
though
worth
a
buy
each
winter
great
beer
highly
recommend
it
i
got
a
screaming
deal
on
this
beer
since
were
a
little
past
season
although
spring
really
hasnt
gotten
here
yet
the
beer
doesnt
taste
like
its
past
its
prime
i
would
think
it
would
have
a
long
shelf
life
i
paid
4
99
a
sixer
and
made
sure
i
grabbed
two
purchased
at
hennessey
market
in
butte
montana
overall
very
pleasant
winter
warmer
enjoyed
this
sipper
interesting
beer
not
a
heavy
winter
ale
but
with
good
complexity
not
extraordinary
but
worth
trying
if
you
dig
english
beers
with
different
twists
british
roots
run
deep
with
this
beer
biscuit
crystal
malts
hints
of
vanilla
anise
and
a
moderate
bitterness
that
comes
off
quite
earthy
overall
it
is
a
smooth
nutty
and
somewhat
musty
winter
warmer
that
unfortunately
comes
off
a
little
thin
12
oz
bottle
pours
brown
with
tall
long
lasting
fluffy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
of
herbal
piney
hops
spices
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
coffee
and
caramel
malt
body
is
full
and
tangy
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
finish
is
long
and
dry
it
was
a
perfect
brew
to
drink
after
shoveling
snow
a
mildly
disappointing
winter
ale
the
spicemalt
interplay
overlooked
for
the
most
part
and
that
edgy
metallic
nature
hard
to
deny
from
midgame
on
simple
perhaps
a
little
too
much
so
to
the
point
where
im
starting
to
think
about
my
search
for
something
else
now
eleven
years
later
still
a
winter
favorite
of
mine
not
too
find
of
this
one
but
im
glad
i
was
ale
to
try
it
overall
an
ok
brew
but
the
hop
chocolate
coffee
and
sweet
just
never
really
seem
to
meld
all
that
well
on
the
tongue
worth
a
try
but
not
the
best
winter
warmer
out
there
i
bought
this
since
i
had
been
on
a
tour
of
the
pyramid
brewery
in
seattle
and
it
was
on
sale
in
the
store
where
i
bought
the
bomber
definetly
worth
the
2
49
sale
price
but
would
not
pick
it
up
otherwise
it
is
a
change
of
pace
and
interesting
but
the
burnt
toast
on
the
end
is
just
not
my
thing
the
initial
roasted
chocolate
and
malts
start
out
well
nice
smell
just
does
not
finish
to
my
taste
is
all
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
after
a
nice
aroma
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
live
up
to
it

this
pours
a
medium
amber
brown
color
with
a
pretty
big
foamy
head
so
this
bottle
might
be
a
little
over
fermented
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
malts
and
spices
lots
of
spices
in
the
beginning
that
turn
into
a
bitter
finish
a
little
too
much
carbonation
behind
this
which
is
probably
because
if
the
age
a
decent
enough
tasting
beer
middle
of
the
road
or
slightly
better
i
guess
well
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
one
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
on
sale
at
total
wine
best
by
date
is
41513
so
i
thought
i
was
safe
with
that
however
the
first
three
of
these
are
infected
or
way
overcarbonated
or
both
just
a
carbonated
foamy
mess
if
one
or
two
bottles
were
like
this
there
may
be
an
explanation
but
with
three
bottles
infected
i
have
to
write
this
off
as
a
bad
beer
not
infected
sour
and
overcarbonated
some
caramel
flavors
but
all
in
all
a
disaster
stay
away
from
this
one
o
solid
winter
warmer
i
mustve
liked
it
three
seperate
takes
before
the
review
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
wine
glass
did
not
have
the
appropiate
glassware
with
me
no
head
anymore
and
no
carbonation
we
thought
this
beer
was
gone
bad
the
opposit
was
going
on
what
a
surprisingly
good
beer
for
its
age
poured
this
winter
warmer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
mahogany
color
produced
a
thin
off
white
head
poor
retention
and
it
left
an
average
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
and
alcohol
medium
in
body
smooth
a
foundation
of
toasted
malt
chocolate
sweet
caramel
raisins
and
dry
alcohol
which
gives
way
to
herbal
hop
bitterness
nice
session
beer
overall
avg
for
the
style
i
would
classify
pyramid
as
a
secondtier
craft
brewery
but
i
am
quite
partial
to
this
winter
concoction
it
is
smokier
than
smoked
salmon
perhaps
nuts
sautéed
in
brown
sugar
topped
with
roasted
spices
and
smoked
cheese
and
then
added
to
a
mild
leafy
green
salad
is
the
best
way
to
describe
the
way
this
ale
tickles
the
taste
buds
it
is
very
sweet
yet
defies
the
label
of
dessert
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
good
retention
and
very
nice
lace
aroma
is
of
dark
fruits
and
bready
malts
body
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
fruit
with
hints
of
citrus
hops
brown
sugar
and
caramel
malts
are
there
as
well
warmed
me
up
a
bit
o
a
complex
warming
beer
great
for
taking
the
edge
of
a
cold
day
this
would
pair
well
with
rich
hearty
meal
like
beef
stew
or
a
standing
rib
roast
since
this
beer
does
have
spices
in
it
id
be
inclined
to
call
it
an
old
ale
o
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
that
i
wont
avoid
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
particularly
memorable
i
served
my
beer
right
out
of
the
cellar
at
50
degrees
this
beer
might
be
better
served
cold
but
ideally
that
wouldnt
be
the
case
right
probably
worth
trying
heavy
beer
good
for
lazy
weekends
in
the
winter
has
a
chocolatey
note
gets
you
numb
rather
than
buzzed
finishing
a
bottle
of
this
is
like
reading
a
wellwritten
but
dense
book
ultimately
satisfying
and
enriching
but
it
takes
a
lot
of
effort
and
an
investment
of
time
snow
cap
the
bottle
says
deep
mahogany
in
color
our
fullbodied
winter
water
is
brewed
in
the
spirit
of
british
winter
ales
crafted
with
a
flurry
of
roasted
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
and
generously
hopped
it
delivers
a
smooth
finish
that
makes
this
beer
the
perfect
cold
weather
companion
overall
a
decent
ale
the
flavor
is
not
as
rich
as
the
smell
is
but
its
still
fairly
good
or
drinkable
at
the
very
least
overall
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
that
i
will
be
returning
to
in
the
future
if
you
enjoy
the
winter
warmer
style
of
ale
check
this
out
you
wont
be
disappointed
atmosphere
is
okay
decent
hue
underwhelming
head
and
just
a
bit
of
lacing
that
mostly
retreats
back
in
the
body
of
the
brew
nose
is
nondescript
combination
of
malts
with
a
little
fresh
tea
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
light
combination
of
earthy
malt
bitter
pecan
shells
offset
with
just
the
lightest
sweet
hint
overall
this
is
a
fair
quaff
overall
i
think
it
is
a
good
solid
winter
time
beer
enjoyable
with
great
flavor
cheers
dark
and
malty
with
a
nice
finish
and
hoppy
flavor
a
truly
great
winter
warmer
one
of
my
favorite
tasting
winter
beers
its
light
enough
to
drink
but
still
has
a
dark
flavor
the
complexity
of
flavor
is
a
true
experience
and
shows
that
pyramid
knows
how
to
brew
beer
i
love
portland
microbrews
o
there
are
others
in
this
style
i
tend
to
like
much
more
old
fezziwig
but
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
overall
not
bad
for
a
winter
warmer
but
i
would
choose
others
over
this
one
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
my
expectations
were
exceeded
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
above
average
overall
a
superbly
complex
winter
beer
i
found
myself
trying
to
place
the
fruitiness
but
found
it
hard
to
pick
out
any
specific
flavors
that
said
its
interesting
and
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
o
it
surprised
me
with
the
hop
finish
its
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
try
again
pours

with

some

faint
chocolate
taste
opens
as
a
wall
of

some
dark
chocolate
some
raspberry
bittering
really
remains
and
creates
a
problematic
aftertaste
good
flavor
in
here
but
just
too
bitter
to
really
enjoy
full
body
has
some
qualities
that
remind
me
of
a
weizenbock
sweet
dark
fruits
a
little
watery
on
the
tongue
balance
is
there
but
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
concise
flavors
that
blend
well
together
but
its
nothing
wowing
in
fact
its
quite
a
simple
beer
underlying
notes
of
roasted
malts
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
but
mostly
fruity
drinkable
but
wouldnt
buy
it
again
just
cause
there
are
better
options
i
would
definitely
choose
it
as
a
winter
warmer
anytime
well
worth
the
time
overall
pretty
drinkable
that
i
think
most
people
would
enjoy
outshined
by
many
others

the

this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
brewer
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
line
up
it
seems
well
crafted
and
had
a
nice
fruitiness
to
it
i
was
ready
to
give
this
beer
a
good
rating
i
bought
a
sixpack
and
didnt
drink
it
right
after
i
bought
it
now
it
has
some
debris
settling
at
the
bottom
i
dont
know
what
this
is
but
in
the
past
its
always
a
bad
sign
i
dont
know
if
it
means
the
beer
is
going
bad
or
what
but
thats
what
it
seems
like
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
thats
why
i
got
it
again
maybe
there
should
be
an
expiration

goes
away

smells

a

and
a
little
bit
of
coffee
tastes
of
dark
caramelized
malt
and
a
slight
hint
of
a
sweet
candy
type
taste
seems
like
it
is
a
little
overcarbonated
but
still
goes
down
nicely
overall
a
good
beer

paired
nicely

a
rare
porterhouse

im
not
the
biggest

fan
but
i
figured
ill
try
this

the
taste
is
okay

kind
of
tasted
like
a
hopped
up
honey
mashed
with
pine
and
spruce
needles
or
maybe
even
a
hoppy
brown
not
outstanding
i
would
call
this
a
safe
winter
had
its
moments
probably
wont
buy
again
a
fairly
run
of
the
mill
beer
not
anything
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
o
nice
winter
warmer
nothing
over
the
top
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
huge
3
inch
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
random
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
dark
fruits
and
some
spice
aromas
there
is
also
a
distinct
apple
cider
aroma
i
am
getting
taste
is
of
bready
malt
caramel
subdued
fruit
and
some
herbal
hop
flavors
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
with
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
but
nothing
too
exciting
i
recently
tried
maritimes
jolly
roger
also
from
seattle
it
costs
about
2
more
and
tastes
8
better
hey
thats
how
much
snowcap
costs
panhandle
that
2
if
you
have
to
theres
no
good
reason
you
anyone
should
set
their
winter
warmer
bar
this
low
and
theres
other
better
just
as
local
winter
warmers
out
there
d
different
for
a
winter
warmer
but
still
a
flavorful
and
quite
satisfying
abv
is
a
little
high
for
a
session
but
it
works
well
to
cope
with
those
chilly
winter
nights
overall
this
is
ok
more
hoppy
then
i
expected
and
the
malt
flavors
arent
that
impressive
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
a
ok
winter
seasonal
overall
i
glad
i
split
this
beer
very
generic
type
winter
seasonal
pours
a
redish
hue
of
brown
with
a
very
small
head
that
disappears
almost
instantly
smells
a
bit
spiced
like
mulled
wine
same
aromotics
the
flavor
is
definitely
more
balanced
with
piney
hops
and
a
residual
sweetness
beer
is
full
bodied
and
has
low
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
average
winter
warmer
has
all
the
critical
components
but
does
nothing
to
excite
me
in
any
rousing
way
in
conclusion
this
is
a
favorable
bittersweet
decoction
drink
not
overly
great
but
to
start
a
night
off
its
pretty
good
a
little
above
average
probably
not
gonna
return
to
this
one
im
from
texas
rigga
dig
dig
dig
dig
rigga
dig
dog
dig
deer
o
looks
great
not
much
on
the
nose
taste
is
ok
mouthfeel
is
sufficient
overall
snow
cap
is
an
ok
winter
ale
worth
a
try
this
is
a
full
bodied
ale
that
would
be
a
winter
warmer
for
the
hop
head
so
i
took
it
as
it
is
because
the
balance
in
this
ale
is
so
good
that
i
had
a
little
of
both
worlds
of
taste
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
spice
but
i
give
this
ale
thumbs
up
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
jubilale
is
far
superior
overall
the
aftertaste
isnt
amazing
the
beer
lacks
balance
and
has
some
sharp
characteristics
that
arent
that
great
t
yikes
i
read
some
of
the
other
reviews
of
this
and
it
seemed
that
other
people
thought
this
was
pretty
good
so
maybe
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
but
yikes
it
tasted
like
sucking
on
a
pine
cone
with
an
aftertaste
of
aspirin
pine
and
bitterness
just
for
the
sake
of
bitterness
not
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
i
could
barely
finish
this
overall
i
usually
have
the
winter
warmers
when
they
start
to
come
out
every
year
the
only
one
that
i
keep
going
back
to
is
jubelale
i
believe
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
snowcap
i
assumed
it
to
be
a
bland
winter
warmer
but
am
wrong
this
is
better
than
some
out
there
for
sure
i
will
be
getting
this
again
45
o
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
dont
know
that
i
would
go
for
it
again
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
the
licorice
aroma
in
particular
was
interesting
over
all
this
was
a
nice
beer
but
not
one
i
would
drive
out
of
my
way
for
overall
a
good
but
not
great
winter
warmer
i
can
still
enjoy
this
as
a
sentimental
favorite
but
thankfully
better
versions
of
the
style
are
available
o
the
best
beer
from
pyramid
that
ive
had
and
maybe
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
had
i
salute
pyramid
for
restoring
this
beer
to
its
proper
place
i
was
nearly
ready
to
write
it
off
but
am
glad
i
tried
this
version
poured
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
modest
white
head
that
lingered
as
a
thin
layer
of
dense
bubbles
mostly
malts
and
licorice
in
the
nose
roasty
malts
licorice
anise
in
the
taste
with
a
touch
of
pine
and
nutmeg
a
bit
medicinal
at
times
but
not
intolerably
so
medium
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
my
favorite
brew
from
pyramid
not
saying
much
and
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
saying
a
lot
concluding
thoughts
not
bad
for
its
style
it
was
only
8
00
for
a
six
pack
and
beats
out
alot
of
beer
of
this
style
in
this
price
range
at
least
from
what
i
have
tasted
wouldnt
mind
getting
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
a
classic
winter
staple
in
these
parts
a
respectable
if
uninspiring
winter
warmer
not
one
id
rush
to
the
store
and
get
or
be
anywhere
near
the
top
of
my
list
unless
i
was
on
a
budget
and
had
to
get
a
winterstyle
ale
i
actually
havent
even
had
one
of
these
in
a
few
years
but
i
used
to
drink
them
quite
frequently
before
i
discovered
the
better
choices
out
there
i
do
remember
a
conspicuous
alcohol
taste
with
not
much
complexity
at
all
but
will
definitely
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
winter
night
drinkability
is
moderate
in
this
one
its
best
enjoyed
only
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
as
its
more
on
the
heavy
side
the
alcohol
is
warming
however
and
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
winter
summary
this
is
an
average
beer
i
gave
it
7
010
or
c
this
has
an
extremely
hoppy
taste
even
for
an
ale
i
liked
the
smell
but
i
can
barely
taste
any
of
the
malts
or
spice
it
would
be
better
if
it
were
more
balanced
it
is
very
filling
has
nice
alcohol
content
and
warms
me
up
like
it
says
it
should
it
also
makes
me
hungry
and
sleepy
i
would
drink
this
beer
sparingly
but
would
never
turn
it
down
if
offered
one
the
mouthfeel
if
smooth
and
creamy
not
too
dry
and
balance
more
toward
sweetness
but
not
overly
so
the
carbonation
level
is
low
and
seems
to
pair
well
with
this
style
there
is
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
and
i
would
recomend
this
as
an
evening
sipper
you
can
taste
the
7
and
it
is
pleasing
final
notes
a
solid
winter
warmer
its
no
descutes
jubelale
or
anything
but
its
a
very
pleasing
beer
great
beer
to
pair
with
dessert
ill
be
coming
back
for
more
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
fine
example
of
the
winter
warmer
style
with
a
nice
malty
sweetness
i
would
purchase
this
beer
again
if
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
winter
beer
d
i
have
5
more
of
these
i
might
share
one
but
will
likely
drink
the
others
poured
into
glass
and
got
only
about
a
14
inch
of
head
that
was
down
to
a
small
ring
of
froth
in
a
few
minutes
the
beer
is
mahogany
with
a
nice
redish
color
up
to
the
light
not
much
of
an
aroma
on
this
beer
beer
felt
good
in
the
mouth
the
tickling
of
carbination
despite
the
lack
froth
really
light
on
the
front
end
with
some
subtle
hops
and
a
smooth
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
bitterness
the
back
end
follows
with
some
pronounced
pine
hops
it
is
a
good
winter
warmer
sipping
beer
more
flavors
come
out
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
a
medium
body
but
feels
fairly
light
for
this
style
its
pretty
sessionable
if
youre
in
the
mood
despite
all
the
other
winter
brews
in
the
season
i
happened
to
like
this
one
for
its
drinkability
i
mean
its
keeps
you
warm
and
you
can
have
a
few
with
that
full
feeling
its
also
a
great
beer
to
give
to
your
friends
perhaps
to
introduce
them
to
seasonal
beer
or
craft
brew
for
that
matter
sure
theres
better
xmas
beer
than
this
but
than
again
this
aint
to
bad
either
go
out
and
buy
some
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
interesting
unique
and
no
significant
flaws
make
for
a
great
sipper
drinkability
i
think
this
is
my
first
winter
warmer
and
i
like
this
as
an
example
with
it
being
so
malty
i
am
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
two
at
one
sitting
this
is
a
beer
i
can
get
in
utah
pours
a
nice
inch
of
head
doesnt
hang
in
there
that
long
though
smells
very
malty
i
get
subtle
hints
of
coffee
and
maybe
chocolate
malt
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
subtle
taste
of
coffee
very
malty
not
much
else
in
the
taste
to
talk
about
kinda
boring
other
than
those
two
things
not
a
bad
beer
very
drinkable
just
kinda
boring
and
average
i
really
was
digging
snow
caps
old
label
art
the
new
one
is
pretty
cheesy
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
while
shoveling
snow
ive
done
it
before
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
nonspecial
winter
warmers
great
beer
for
the
price
ive
purchased
this
beer
several
times
now
its
also
one
of
my
favorite
beers
by
pryamid
drinkability
for
an
english
strong
ale
it
is
a
little
weak
as
it
comes
across
as
more
of
an
irish
red
snow
cap
was
a
nice
surprise
give
it
a
try
if
you
want
a
winter
seasonal
thats
not
too
heavy
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
here
im
a
big
fan
of
winter
warmers
and
i
thought
this
one
was
quite
good
the
thickness
of
the
beer
almost
coats
the
mouth
a
little
too
much
leaving
nearly
a
film
but
i
quite
enjoy
this
one
pours
an
extremely
dark
red
color
almost
brown
with
a
medium
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
scent
is
somewhat
roasty
with
sweet
chocolatey
notes
lots
of
maltiness
as
well
taste
is
initially
roasted
malt
with
some
tasty
dark
fruits
then
i
get
slight
hoppiness
with
chocolate
and
dark
licorice
lots
of
maltiness
carry
on
throughout
with
small
hints
of
alcohol
and
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
pretty
fullbodied
with
a
nice
creamy
finish
although
winter
warmers
are
not
even
close
to
being
one
of
my
favorite
styles
it
is
pretty
tasty
with
descent
drinkability
this
is
my
favorite
pyramid
beer
the
best
things
in
life
are
made
from
components
that
are
in
balance
this
is
just
way
too
much
for
my
taste
had
this
in
a
hotel
room
in
portland
before
heading
out
to
celebrate
a
buddys
birthday
pours
an
amberbrown
colour
with
huge
head
and
lots
of
lacing
quite
a
malty
aroma
bread
like
almost
are
there
spices
in
here
there
may
be
but
it
is
quite
faint
if
it
is
incredibly
sweet
beer
but
it
is
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
better
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
single
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
color
has
a
nice
cola
hue
to
it
not
much
head
with
minimal
lacing
smell
reminded
me
of
a
sugary
cinnamon
roll
taste
was
pretty
nice
i
liked
the
spiciness
to
this
beer
lots
of
winter
spices
that
go
well
in
this
style
of
beer
plenty
of
malt
noticed
on
the
palate
but
would
have
liked
to
seen
a
bit
more
hops
to
balance
things
out
another
seasonal
that
hides
its
abv
very
well
snow
cap
is
surely
a
good
choice
for
a
winter
beer
from
this
wellknow
west
coast
brewery
served
in
a
pint
glass
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
pyramid
is
a
local
brewery
here
in
seattle
and
i
love
making
it
down
to
their
brewhouse
for
some
exclusive
beers
including
this
beer
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
first
noticed
a
small
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
some
lacing
on
the
glass
reddishbrown
in
color
a
malty
aroma
with
some
hoppyness
taste
is
toasted
malt
sweetness
upfront
a
bit
of
spicyness
in
the
middle
followed
by
bitterness
very
smooth
medium
body
very
drinkable
i
did
not
even
notice
the
7
a
worthy
winter
seasonal
moreys
bottom
line
a
nice
beer
glad
i
picked
up
this
single
bottle
has
some
of
the
darker
flavors
of
anchor
christmas
combined
with
the
likes
of
old
fezziwig
nice
appearance
with
a
mediocre
smell
but
complex
flavors
all
combine
to
make
a
this
a
richrobust
fullbodied
winter
warmer
even
though
there
is
barely
any
bitterness
it
does
not
distract
or
hurt
the
overall
impact
of
this
beer
i
will
recommend
this
to
others
i
try
to
be
as
objective
as
i
can
in
the
reviews
and
snow
cap
lacks
the
complexity
to
compare
with
a
lot
of
beer
on
this
website
that
being
said
i
really
enjoyed
snow
cap
and
would
definitely
purchase
it
again
its
merely
a
plain
jane
sort
of
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
never
goes
away
and
a
wealth
of
lacing
smells
of
toasted
malts
and
a
full
blast
of
hop
aroma
tastes
very
one
note
like
a
foray
of
hop
bitterness
on
top
of
even
more
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
okay
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
and
not
at
all
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
although
possibly
a
little
too
filling
for
highlyrepeated
sampling
very
clear
ambercopper
hued
beer
with
a
fizzy
near
fingerwidth
head
dark
coloring
fairly
handsome
smell
is
of
mature
cherries
caramel
malts
and
some
faint
generic
hops
taste
features
smokey
dark
malts
balanced
pretty
well
with
slightly
tinny
hops
noticeable
prickly
fruity
edge
with
a
fairly
strong
bitter
finish
this
beer
had
a
very
unique
smokey
charcoal
character
was
this
malt
smoked
over
something
has
a
distinct
earthy
quality
to
it
not
bad
i
liked
the
fruit
character
and
accompanying
sweet
caramel
malts
too
much
aggressive
hops
in
the
finish
for
me
and
that
odd
charcoal
taste
got
old
a
while
i
can
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
stronger
beers
in
the
dead
of
winter
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
caramel
the
nose
is
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
slight
malt
there
is
a
bit
of
spicing
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
again
slight
malt
and
brings
a
bit
of
spicing
but
doesnt
go
over
the
top
decent
body
and
while
this
doesnt
bring
too
much
spice
like
many
of
the
style
it
ends
up
being
quite
tame
and
plain
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
balanced
and
fullflavored
offering
from
pyramid
overall
im
not
too
big
into
pyramid
brews
personally
but
this
one
makes
for
a
pretty
decent
offering
as
the
winter
warmer
tag
suggests
it
does
in
fact
make
for
a
good
beer
to
drink
during
colder
weather
flavor
a
warming
alcohol
beginning
leads
into
a
fruity
and
spicy
middle
dominated
by
figs
and
raisins
though
some
cherry
and
citrus
can
be
detected
this
full
bodied
winter
beer
the
only
reason
drinkability
scored
relatively
low
for
me
is
sure
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
coming
months
came
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
richly
brown
head
that
faded
moderately
quickly
but
laced
very
well
throughout
the
drink
it
smelled
rich
and
toasty
with
a
touch
of
hoppyness
coming
through
tasted
similar
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
helped
to
balance
the
roasted
grains
well
rather
thin
for
this
type
and
if
it
had
been
thicker
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
this
did
help
its
drinkability
though
especially
on
a
warm
day
got
this
at
freddies
to
go
with
dinner
pours
deep

this

helps
the

significantly
if
this

any

tasting
as
it
does
now
it
would
loose
major
points
ill
finish
the
sixer
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
jube
for
winter
warmers
weather
starting
to
cool
down
these
days
so
thought
id
get
myself
a
higher
abv
beer
to
sip
on
ive
usually
found
pyramid
beers
to
be
at
least
decent
but
really
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
for
a
beer
youre
supposed
to
sip
on
theres
not
much
complexity
at
all
to
it
and
just
tastes
flat
havent
had
too
many
other
beers
of
this
style
so
maybe
its
just
the
style
im
not
a
fan
of
should
have
saved
my
money
bought
pbr
d
def
some
more
robust
winter
warmers
out
there
wassail
from
full
sail
and
jubelale
from

are
go

brews
but
for
2

i
suppose
this
one
could
be
found
in
the
fridge
on
occasion
i
mean
i
am
a
student
soooo
dthis
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
winter
warmer
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
the

0
abv
is
about
this
beers
best
feature
overall
lackluster
nothing
earthshattering
but
definitely
solid
malt
hops
and
alcohol
seem
to
hit
all
the
right
targets
for
the
style
very

to

been
sitting
on
this
for
a
bit
and
didnt
seem
to
change
over
time
taste
the
same
as
it
did
years
ago
before
the
awful
package
change
but
thats
a
whole
other
story
taste
is
a
malty
chocolate
doing
a
good
job
masking
the
7
overall
a
very
drinkable
winter
brew
im
glad
they
didnt
add
all
that
funky
stuff
like
tree
limbs
tire
iron
or
other
crap
from
the
spice
rack
and
just
make
a
good
traditional
winter
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
chocolate
taste
is
like
the
smell
malts
and
chocolate
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fine
offering
d
alright
but
kind
of
week
for
a
winter
warmer
a
little
bit
taken
away
due
to
the
nasty
apple
peel
aftertaste
nothing
that
memorable
hazy
chocolate
brown
in
color
offwhite
head
dissappears
quickly
with
creamy
reminents
aroma
is
fruity
and
spicy
lots
of
complex
flavors
here
robust
floral
hops
spicy
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
dark
fruits
whole
wheat
toast
molasses
and
caramel
sweetness
also
a
touch
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
medium
to
fullbodied
ale
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
warming
from
the
alcohol
im
impressed
with
this
one
tons
of
rich
and
spicy
flavors
which
are
well
balanced
a
solid
winter
seasonal
and
good
in
the
summer
too
d
not
a
good
warm
weather
beer
for
sure
there
are
too
many
contradictory
flavors
and
the
bottom
line
is
this
is
not
at
all
close
to
any
winter
warmer
ive
heard
of
before
its
more
like
an
amber
ale
with
a
bit
of
caramel
as
an
afterthought
generally
i
have
been
underwhelmed
by
the
beers
from
pyramid
but
this
one
pretty
good
full
flavoured
and
well
balanced
this
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
malt
forward
winter
warmer
the
beer
has
some
caramel
on
the
finish
and
is
on
the
drier
side
could
drink
a
few
of
these
cant
imagine
drinking
too
many
of
these
granted
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
malty
beers
anymore
but
this
one
is
hard
to
finish
sharp
and
full
its
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
something
i
imagine
drinking
very
often
glad
i
tried
it
glad
to
be
moving
on
dthis
gets
better
as
it
warms
slightly
grainy
in
flavor
but
has
some
nice
spices
in
there
and
a
decent
balance
not
bad
not
bad
poured
with
a
medium
light
tan
head
that
mostly
subsided
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
dark
hard
to
say
if
a
little
hazy
or
not
mahoganey
aroma
is
malty
roasty
and
a
little
spicey
flavor
is
similar
but
much
richer
has
more
of
the
bittersweet
thing
obviously
but
also
certain
other
flavors
such
as
caramel
toffee
black
pepper
chilli
pepper
and
dates
full
body
and
good
carbonation
tiny
bit
boozy
at
the
very
end
could
be
a
session
d
its
ok
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
ok
drinkability
was
just
ok
7
00
abv
and
average
taste
made
it
average
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
with
a
finger
of
shortlived
shadowy
white
head
that
leaves
a
similarly
shortlived
bit
of
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
sweet
with
darker
malts
figs
and
a
snap
of
cinnamon
firing
through
near
the
end
of
a
deep
sniff
the
taste
takes
a
surprising
oneeighty
spin
toward
hoppiness
with
heavy
pine
notes
stampeding
over
the
initial
sweet
maltiness
it
all
seems
very
unbalanced
and
rather
than
being
a
gradual
shift
sudden
in
the
flavor
change
the
moderate
body
and
crsip
finish
help
but
cannot
overcome
the
poor
balance
and
overly
active
carbonation
which
keep
the
drinkability
lower
than
it
otherwise
would
be
beer
notes
i
had
two
of
these
for
this
tasting
and
learned
two
things
1
this
brew
needs
to
breath
for
a
while
before
drinking
it
really
helps
soften
the
alcohol
taste
2
let
this
beer
come
up
to
just
below
room
temp
and
treat
it
like
liquor
for
serving
purposes
the
beer
pours
brilliantly
clear
dark
amber
bordering
on
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
moderatehigh
malt
pronounced
sweet
caramel
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
smellbittersweet
caramel
with
moderate
hop
bitterness
that
keeps
the
beer
from
being
cloying
the
body
is
bordering
on
full
carbonation
is
moderate
and
just
a
bit
of
alcoholic
warmth
overall
a
nicely
made
warmerintense
malt
balanced
by
solid
hop
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
booze
buy
again
yes
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
but
not
incredibly
exciting
beer
in
years
past
i
used
to
anxiously
wait
for
for
this
seasonal
to
show
up
at
the
pub
then
one
year
i
suddenly
lost
a
taste
for
it
and
havent
had
it
in
a
long
time
i
have
to
be
honest
i
expected
to
give
this
a
mediocre
review
but
after
breaking
it
down
it
actually
isnt
bad
d
not
bad
but
just
mediocre
what
we
have
here
is
an
overly
dry
and
bland
earthy
beer
not
very
winterish
a
bit
too
thin
in
flavor
as
well
d
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
and
could
have
at
least
2
or
3
in
a
session
im
surprised
other
reviews
were
so
low
for
this
beer
i
think
this
is
solid
good
fallwinter
brew
but
not
one
id
seek
out
often
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
from
what
i
have
had
this
is
probably
pyramids
best
beer
a
very
simple
winter
warmer
but
not
bad
at
all
an
invigorating
and
impressive
beer
mouthfeel
delightfully
sticks
around
no
dissipation
throughout
comes
close
to
being
a
desert
beer
a
very
drinkable
beer
when
you
stick
to
one
or
two
a
night
conclusion
nothing
really
offensive
here
except
for
the
fact
that
its
a
bit
boozy
but
there
arent
a
lot
of
redeeming
qualities
either
there
are
a
lot
better
winter
warmers
both
imports
and
domestics
to
pick
up
a
nice
winter
warmer
nothing
stands
out
too
much
just
a
solid
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
fairly
average
beer
just
another
malty
lightly
hopped
beer
in
my
book
i
enjoy
some
of
the
pyramid
beers
but
this
is
not
a
winner
for
me
have
been
drinking
this
beer
for
many
many
years
while
nothing
special
its
a
solid
offering
and
one
of
the
better
beers
made
by
pyramid
brewing
these
days
drinkability
very
affordable
and
a
well
masked
sessionable
abv
there
are
just
alot
of
other
winter
warmers
with
much
more
flavor
really
hit
the
spot
at
the
christmas
party
last
night
and
by
the
end
of
the
night
my
shoes
had
tasted
a
decent
amount
of
it
too
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
with
snow
cap
but
given
the
ambiguity
of
the
style
i
would
consider
it
a
worthy
selection
at
the
ski
lodge
bar
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
leaves
you
with
a
good
feeling
overall
im
a
little
annoyed
that
the
6pack
was
a
year
old
but
overall
this
beer
is
nicely
aged
and
a
delicious
sipper
not
my
cup
of
tea
for
a
winter
beer
malty
medicinal
minty
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
relatively
dark
amber
with
a
smallish
head
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
bandaids
and
mint
with
some
malt
presence
the
flavor
is
a
tad
sweet
for
my
liking
its
not
a
terrible
strong
ale
but
its
not
terribly
interesting
or
worth
another
purchase
jubelale
may
be
a
dollar
or
two
more
for
a
six
pack
but
its
worth
it
copper
bodied
brew
with
light
offwhite
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
a
little
lace
a
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
both
sweet
and
roasted
and
very
minor
spice
no
hops
thicker
than
expected
but
still
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
malt
base
that
is
both
dry
and
sweet
if
not
minor
and
a
little
spice
and
hop
bitterness
make
for
a
bland
but
still
decent
winter
warmer
for
mass
market
consumption
goes
down
easy
and
while
i
wont
seek
this
out
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
drinkability
decent
to
drink
but
there
are
far
better
winter
warmers
and
better
brews
from
pyramid
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
from
pyramid
but
its
not
a
totally
bad
brew
clear
mahogany
with
a
mat
of
creamy
offwhite
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
plenty
of
lace
behind
insipid
aroma
of
raw
hops
and
barely
sweet
malt
coarse
hop
bitterness
not
hop
flavor
overwhelms
the
palate
making
the
caramel
maltiness
barely
detectable
a
tornado
of
carbonation
scrubs
the
tongue
clean
of
what
little
flavor
there
is
and
gives
a
displeasing
mouthfeel
i
think
one
of
these
is
more
than
enough
overall
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
not
something
i
will
go
in
search
of
when
oregon
provides
so
many
other
options
this
time
of
year
drinkability
pretty
good
would
drink
it
again
but
have
had
better
winter
warmers
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
is
drinkable
not
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
ive
had
and
frankly
ive
had
better
from
pyramid
but
still
a
good
offering
try
it
out
drinkability
this
was
the
beer
of
record
for
my
bands
halloween
party
this
year
so
i
salvaged
one
to
review
on
a
more
sober
occasion
i
will
say
that
overall
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
could
be
dangerous
in
the
wrong
hands
i
e
mine
im
not
much
of
a
winter
warmer
fan
but
this
is
pretty
standard
amongst
breweries
these
days
it
seems
glassware
pint
taste
is
creamy
a
little
bit
of
sour
malt
some
caramel
some
nuts
and
a
little
spice
ends
bitter
slightly
dry
actually
one
of
the
better
winter
seasonals
i
have
had
yet
this
year
and
i
would
have
to
say
it
hangs
up
there
with
jubelale
if
not
better
but
it
is
different
for
sure
nice
malty
mixture
its
also
in
the
aroma
of
a
darkish
and
big
offwhite
head
drink
with
cola
and
spice
very
drinkable
this
one
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
from
the
brewery
some
sugaranise
fruit
like
apricotmild
ginger
a
tad
above
average
mouthfeel
poured
from
a
stubby
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
dimpled
mug
appears
a
clear
dark
apricot
color
with
two
fingers
of
lingering
light
ecru
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
medium
toasted
bready
grains
spicy
hops
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
creamy
medium
body
with
adequate
carbonation
for
its
style
worth
trying
drinkability
considering
the
7
0
alc
it
is
remarkably
smooth
this
beer
was
decent
good
winter
beer
can
be
drank
during
cold
seasons
or
spring
not
the
best
winter
beer
but
a
solid
b
a
pours
off
brown
with
slight
haze
thin
white
head
dissipates
quickly
to
a
thin
white
rim
nose
is
weak
without
much
to
report
but
perhaps
a
faint
mocha
palate
has
a
brown
sugary
high
alcohol
character
to
it
and
it
finishes
rather
warm
winter
warmer
yes
but
not
in
a
good
way
eric
this
is
one
of
the
spicier
winter
warmers
ive
had
which
i
enjoy
decent
brew
some
work
on
the
aroma
and
body
would
make
it
great
the
color
is
mahogany
to
nearblack
a
tan
head
pours
pretty
tight
and
leaves
a
few
light
patches
of
lacing
a
nice
blend
of
malts
and
hops
with
some
spices
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
more
of
a
licorice
in
the
flavor
to
back
up
some
good
malts
unlike
many
winter
warmers
spices
are
wellblended
and
by
no
means
overpowering
they
mix
nicely
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
with
a
nice
medium
to
full
body
and
a
lingering
malt
and
light
licorice
finish
the
hops
are
also
a
little
more
prominent
than
in
most
winter
warmers
and
adds
to
the
balance
overall
a
drinkable
beer
black
body
and
a
mediumsized
light
tan
head
bunch
of
blended
together
spices
in
the
aroma
i
think
i
was
able
to
pick
out
some
liccorice
little
bit
of
stoutlike
roastiness
that
i
havent
had
in
a
winter
warmer
before
flowery
hops
add
a
nice
bitterness
and
provide
another
dimension
of
flavor
overall
a
good
winter
warmer
but
this
is
dominated
by
the
hops
instead
of
the
spices
and
malt
i
keep
craving
more
it
is
hoppy
to
the
point
of
pleasing
and
teasing
the
palate
making
you
want
another
but
not
assaulting
or
insulting
your
palate
d
id
have
this
on
again
i
like
the
lingering
bitter
finish
rather
odd
the
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
isnt
something
that
stands
out
either
hits
the
tongue
with
a
little
sweetness
but
finishes
very
hoppily
daaark
brown
with
3
finger
frothy
off
white
head
get
big
hops
up
front
sweetness
in
the
middle
then
the
hop
bite
at
the
end
this
is
on
the
very
verge
of
being
too
bitter
for
me
would
prefer
the
sweetness
be
a
little
more
than
it
is
actually
pretty
suprised
by
how
bittern
this
one
is
considering
how
dark
the
beer
was
just
visually
it
looked
like
a
bigger
beer
for
me
this
is
not
even
close
to
being
near
the
top
for
its
style
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
overall
this
one
strikes
me
as
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
sure
it
has
some
weight
to
it
on
the
palate
but
theres
still
an
overall
watery
quality
to
it
in
my
opinion
i
wont
lie
it
is
full
bodied
but
the
longer
i
let
it
set
in
my
mouth
the
more
like
water
it
begins
to
feel
it
almost
seems
like
it
starts
to
thin
unfortunately
the
alcohol
is
hidden
so
well
in
this
brew
that
it
doesnt
even
warm
as
it
goes
down
ive
a
real
problem
with
winter
warmers
that
dont
warm
as
they
go
down
thats
the
whole
point
isnt
it
i
really
dont
think
ive
had
a
winter
warmer
to
date
that
has
warmed
my
throat
and
belly
this
one
is
easy
enough
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
brew
for
the
price
this
isnt
a
bad
deal
this
isnt
one
id
rush
to
pick
up
and
also
its
not
one
that
id
not
be
adverse
to
another
goround
with
i
tried
this
one
the
first
time
a
couple
weeks
ago
because
a
buddy
of
mine
had
bought
a
keg
of
it
for
one
of
our
team
meets
it
didnt
immediately
get
drained
so
i
had
my
doubts
about
it
i
was
wrong
its
a
very
strong
brew
for
what
it
is
very
rich
flavor
with
coffee
and
espresso
notes
very
smooth
creamy
feel
on
down
drinkability
is
not
so
high
because
of
the
acquired
taste
of
these
types
of
brews
and
definitely
not
a
session
beer
overall
a
decent
winter
brew
but
not
for
everyone
pours
a
dark
brown
colored
body
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
diminishing
strong
fruit
a
malty
aroma
some
sweet
spiciness
and
mustiness
a
little
alcohol
some
sickly
cloying
sweetness
maybe
like
brown
sugar
fizzy
malty
taste
bitter
aftertaste
with
some
hotness
some
sweet
spiciness
in
the
body
too
musty
tasting
that
same
cloying
sickly
sweetness
dark
fruit
and
sweet
spiciness
somewhat
light
flavor
okay
spiced
winter
warmer
style
would
be
better
on
a
colder
day
pretty
drinkable
surely
there
must
be
some
wheat
in
here
the
flavor
is
dark
toasty
malts
with
plenty
of
bittering
hops
and
earthy
wheat
some
roasty
and
toffee
notes
creep
in
there
as
well
further
into
the
glass
has
a
creamy
and
full
mouthfeel
but
yet
is
easy
to
back
more
than
one
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
deserves
a
try
for
winter
seasonal
fans
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
the
flavours
im
getting
arent
all
that
interesting
this
will
be
a
one
of
six
pack
for
me
a
decent
beer
its
american
characteristics
come
through
in
the
hop
department
d
a
tasty
winter
warmer
w
plenty
of
spice
malt
and
hops
to
keep
it
balanced
a
nice
finish
without
any
overdone
sweetness
a
nice
strength
for
quaffing
but
i
wouldnt
have
expected
it
to
be
7
to
be
honest
i
consider
this
a
good
choice
for
a
winter
ale
pours
a
thick
dark
brown
with
a
slight
slight
brown
head
smells
like
a
warmer
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
for
sure
good
mouthfeelsolid
body
and
carbonation
the
hints
of
spiciness
already
on
the
palatte
the
taste
aint
bad
definite
spiciness
and
finishes
with
a
slight
bite
i
think
the
aftertaste
is
kind
of
alcoholy
a
decently
drinkable
brew
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
another
good
release
from
pyramid
breweries
overall
not
a
very
exciting
winter
beer
the
flavors
just
dont
do
it
for
me
tried
a
12
oz
bottle
of
this
decanted
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pretty
dark
red
with
a
very
thin
head
not
much
retention
aromas
are
pretty
simple
malty
some
spices
some
dark
fruit
like
cherries
taste
has
a
strong
malty
center
fairly
nutty
a
light
hoppy
finish
to
it
kinda
bitter
it
travels
a
bit
but
its
not
the
most
dynamic
winter
warmer
ive
tried
middling
mouthfeel
not
quite
watery
but
theres
next
to
no
carbonation
easily
drinkable
one
worth
trying
but
again
not
the
greatest
winter
warmer
out
there
pyramids
2008
warmer
has
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
bitter
and
warm
and
becomes
especially
creamy
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
a
very
enjoyable
drinking
experience
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
ive
had
this
season
lots
of
character
velvety
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
just
enough
alcohol
to
give
you
a
mild
warming
sensation
drinkability
is
farily
good
on
this
one
it
is
a
good
beer
that
has
a
good
all
around
performance
not
anything
too
special
butsomething
that
many
could
enjoy
overall
not
super
complex
but
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable2
or
3
after
shoveling
snow
would
fit
the
bill
nicely
and
at
7
0
abv
would
ease
the
soreness
overall
inferior
end
product
in
a
sea
of
similar
holiday
recipes
drinkable
but
not
with
much
enthusiasm
give
me
an
anchor
steam
christmas
beer
anytime
overall
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
astringent
and
the
finish
is
bitter
the
finish
linger
on
the
palate
for
a
few
moment
the
beer
is
decent
the
beer
to
me
isnt
well
put
together
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
it
the
malt
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
hops
in
the
beer
and
the
mouth
feel
isnt
warming
to
me
the
beer
is
sub
par
i
would
have
like
to
seen
a
more
complete
blended
beer
instead
of
being
tasting
different
components
a
fullbodied
dark
brown
ale
loaded
with
flavors
and
aromas
of
roasted
malt
the
strong
malt
backbone
gives
this
ale
hints
of
dark
fruits
coffee
chocolate
and
oak
a
slightly
sweet
warming
alcohol
sensation
is
present
on
the
finish
along
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
d
well
it
went
down
fine
but
its
a
little
uninspiring
there
are
other
winter
warmers
id
rather
deal
with
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
much
more
in
a
bottle
than
i
did
on
tap
the
hops
were
more
dominating
in
this
version
of
the
beer
and
i
think
that
made
it
better
while
it
is
still
far
from
my
favorite
winter
warmer
it
is
still
a
very
solid
brew
d
im
not
a
real
winter
warmer
guy
but
this
was
very
drinkable
though
much
more
than
one
or
two
would
really
kill
your
ability
to
taste
anything
else
poured
into
straight
pint
glass
poured
with
a
one
finger
head
as
is
my
preference
head
dissipated
quickly
not
much
lacing
a
very
beautiful
dark
reddishbrown
color
nice
spice
notes
and
a
faint
alcohol
presence
in
the
aroma
typical
winter
warmer
flavors
with
a
raisiny
component
a
slight
alcohol
bite
not
at
all
unpleasant
the
body
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
and
the
flavors
dont
linger
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
but
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
in
a
row
while
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
i
look
forward
to
this
release
every
year
you
could
do
much
worse
than
this
for
your
winter
ale
needs
dquite
smooth
for
a
fullerbodied
beer
its
quite
easy
to
drink
id
drink
this
one
again
as
its
maybe
one
of
the
better
winter
brews
ive
enjoyed
this
season
d
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
high
abv
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
to
light
overall
this
is
a
good
holiday
ale
and
for
the
price
id
definitely
have
another
my
father
in
law
intoduced
me
to
snow
cap
for
the
firt
time
my
first
experience
with
anything
from
pyramid
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
dark
ale
with
some
hints
of
the
usual
winter
warmer
style
spices
not
a
blowyourmind
kind
of
beer
but
a
respectable
seasonal
brew
very
easy
to
drink
despite
the
slight
alcohol
taste
nice
warming
at
7
alcohol
not
bad
at
all
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
i
will
try
again
this
beer
is
not
for
all
or
myslef
for
that
matter
prefer
something
with
some
kind
of
hops
to
it
which
this
beer
had
noe
of
i
dont
know
about
this
one
aroma
is
nothing
to
speak
of
because
there
isnt
one
it
looks
great
clear
amber
no
head
the
taste
is
sour
a
mix
of
malt
spice
and
sweat
the
aftertaste
was
very
sweet
making
you
forget
how
sour
the
actual
beer
is
id
go
back
for
more
and
then
remember
and
repeat
again
i
could
not
get
over
it
get
something
else
very
nice
complex
flavors
not
too
bitter
or
heavy
goes
down
smooth
only
downside
is
the
over
carbonation
but
that
can
be
overlooked
would
buy
again
recommend
poured
a
deep
deep
amber
nose
is
a
nice
sweetness
with
definate
fruit
undertones
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
smell
banana
but
mostly
a
carmelized
brown
sugar
flavoring
there
were
hints
of
spice
but
it
was
mostly
sweet
not
sickly
or
overpowering
sweet
but
a
nice
flavor
very
nice
in
the
mouth
slight
tingle
to
the
tounge
the
hop
flavor
makes
this
unique
the
bitterness
could
be
more
than
enough
for
some
but
i
like
how
it
holds
off
the
richness
of
the
malt
and
makes
it
unique
for
style
flavors
adjust
throughout
the
drink
i
would
have
this
again
d
for
the
record
i
hate
mint
i
hate
brushin
my
teeth
with
mint
flavored
toothpase
and
i
hate
mint
flavored
gum
the
wintergreen
notes
here
are
quite
mild
but
they
are
enough
to
turn
a
mint
hater
like
me
away
from
this
beer
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
people
like
this
better
than
i
do
d
good
but
not
great
for
me
certainly
worth
a
revisit
on
my
annual
tour
of
winter
beers
cheers
definitely
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
ive
had
and
certainly
deserving
of
a
higher
rating
poured
this
dark
redish
golden
brown
beer
into
a
pint
glass
its
head
which
starts
off
as
a
good
amount
reduces
into
little
amounts
of
wisps
of
lacing
the
aroma
of
toffee
and
herbal
hops
greet
the
nose
while
the
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
of
the
beer
a
lights
upon
the
tongue
a
good
citrus
of
orange
and
fruit
greets
the
palate
yet
not
very
aggressive
as
a
winter
warmer
typically
goes
hits
the
tongue
with
the
carameltoffee
sweetness
of
the
toasted
malt
up
front
which
lends
a
pleasant
chocolatecoffee
undertone
some
astringent
citrus
dried
apricot
tangerine
along
with
the
herbal
hops
a
bready
walnut
yeast
underwrites
the
whole
thing
but
its
lacking
in
bite
and
aggressiveness
mouthfeel
is
not
as
substantial
as
it
should
be
though
well
carbonated
a
drinkable
sessionable
ale
that
could
have
been
so
much
more
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
is
similar
along
those
lines
it
has
a
malt
dominated
taste
with
a
small
spice
following
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
samuel
smith
winter
welcome
where
is
not
quite
aggressive
as
american
winter
warmers
in
the
mouth
it
is
nicely
carbonated
and
fairly
thin
but
leaves
you
with
a
chewy
aftertaste
overall
not
a
bad
offering
and
i
will
buy
it
again
d
as
the
label
claims
this
brew
acts
as
a
good
warmer
for
those
chilly
winter
months
d
easy
to
drink
yea
it
is
i
felt
this
one
lacked
overall
for
a
winter
warmer
not
a
bad
showing
but
tame
never
again
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
one
could
drink
about
35
of
this
brew
anymore
than
that
and
it
would
become
far
to
rich
however
this
is
a
really
warming
and
enjoyable
beer
when
consumed
upon
a
chilly
evening
this
brew
is
at
its
best
if
you
like
rich
full
bodied
brews
or
a
fan
of
winter
warmers
then
dont
pass
this
one
up
in
the
winter
months
i
recommend
you
give
it
a
try
cheers
d
fairly
drinkable
enough
but
not
real
special
may
tire
of
the
sweetness
this
attractive
warmer
pours
a
rich
mahogany
when
held
to
a
light
the
light
brown
cap
is
thick
and
foamyit
leaves
tons
of
sticky
lace
as
it
recedes
the
nose
is
mostly
sweet
and
very
much
reminds
me
of
some
burnt
cinnamon
toast
this
is
just
the
way
i
like
my
winter
warmers
full
bodied
and
even
more
full
of
flavorthis
one
delivers
nice
amount
of
hopswith
a
small
amount
of
spice
shining
through
toasted
honey
oat
breads
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
pine
like
flavors
on
the
tail
a
touch
of
alcohol
warmthno
complaints
herethis
is
just
how
i
like
it
i
poured
this
out
of
a
22ounce
bottle
its
a
greatlooking
dark
winter
beer
snow
cap
would
make
a
great
beer
to
cook
with
or
to
enjoy
with
a
nice
hearty
meal
really
a
fantastic
seasonal
beer
really
smooth
d
a
very
average
at
best
beer
with
little
to
define
its
true
characteristics
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
overly
sweet
or
heavy
and
at
a
good
abv
at
7
could
be
balanced
a
bit
better
for
my
tastes
but
i
would
drink
this
one
again
nothing
amazing
but
a
nice
winter
warmer
to
throw
into
the
mix
alcohol
isnt
powerful
making
this
one
pleasant
for
regular
drinking
not
a
bad
brew
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
nothing
else
then
for
a
bit
of
variety
in
the
sea
of
winter
warmers
this
strong
ale
comes
up
short
in
a
couple
of
the
more
important
cagegories
real
dark
pour
with
a
pillowy
head
and
great
lacing
aroma
is
very
mild
too
mild
and
indicates
a
strong
malt
content
along
with
the
higher
abv
a
little
flat
on
the
palate
but
a
good
finish
makes
up
for
it
good
taste
flavor
is
enjoyable
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
spices
and
a
stronger
malt
taste
bitter
and
bordering
on
one
dimensional
again
its
sturdy
and
makes
for
a
nice
winter
brew
but
it
lacks
important
qualities
to
be
great
overall
worth
missing
to
be
honest
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
no
foam
or
lacing
to
speak
of
spicy
on
the
nose
slightly
sweet
smelling
with
lots
of
sugary
malts
taste
is
much
the
same
a
little
sour
on
top
of
the
spiciness
some
hints
of
apple
cider
which
could
be
due
to
the
age
some
dry
chocolate
definitely
sweet
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
nice
mouthfeel
slightly
carbonated
alcohol
is
definitely
present
and
a
good
beer
if
it
were
3
months
ago
drinkability
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
think
you
could
enjoy
with
friends
that
arent
all
about
beer
while
reviewing
thunderhead
ipa
earlier
today
i
realized
to
my
surprise
i
have
not
yet
reviewed
this
beer
and
since
the
horrific
heat
wave
that
has
plagued
the
east
coast
is
supposedly
going
to
break
tomorrow
i
figured
id
pop
one
of
the
bottles
i
got
on
clearance
two
weeks
ago
especially
since
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
in
warm
weather
numerous
times
recently
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
that
showed
ruby
hues
when
held
to
light
there
was
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
lated
and
left
spotty
lacing
aroma
was
pine
hops
burnt
caramel
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
spice
burnt
caramel
malts
and
a
decent
amount
of
bitter
pine
hops
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
crisp
with
decent
carbonation
while
this
beer
is
certainly
best
enjoyed
on
a
cold
winter
night
it
seems
to
hold
up
through
the
summer
better
than
most
other
winter
beers
i
am
usually
a
big
fan
of
winter
ales
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
middling
beige
head
the
nose
has
light
grains
and
some
spice
the
taste
is
mild
and
the
spices
seem
to
fight
the
nutty
malts
a
light
body
could
use
a
bit
more
depth
the
taste
is
strong
sweetish
malt
with
caramel
that
tatse
burnt
to
the
point
of
being
lightly
bitter
a
light
earthiness
and
faintly
sour
a
light
cracker
quality
starts
to
take
over
before
a
dry
somewhat
burnt
bitter
finish
with
an
aftertatse
of
crackers
and
light
hops
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
a
little
stickyness
good
drinkability
appearance
is
a
dark
rich
amber
with
a
thin
head
smell
of
light
dark
sweet
roasted
malts
taste
is
roasty
sweet
with
dark
sugar
spice
dark
fruits
and
slight
alchohol
mouthfeel
is
a
solid
medium
with
good
carbonation
what
i
would
overall
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
a
good
solid
winter
ale
the
drinkability
is
just
great
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
ill
be
looking
for
it
again
prosit
mk
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
definite
old
ale
traits
with
the
musty
woodiness
worth
a
try
pretty
solid
winter
warmer
i
will
look
for
this
one
again
next
winter
this
was
a
decent
enough
winter
warmer
with
a
thick
body
pleasant
warming
characteristics
and
was
still
fairly
quaffable
for
a
7
beer
unfortunately
nothing
really
sets
it
apart
from
much
better
winter
beers
out
there
a
drinkable
offering
from
pyramid
but
i
am
confused
as
to
where
it
is
actually
produced
as
the
label
says
portland
and
berkley
but
this
listing
is
under
seattle
at
7
this
is
manageable
at
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
this
is
slightly
above
average
an
ok
winter
beer
to
have
on
hand
popular
and
not
overpowering
in
any
way
this
is
a
less
hoppy
beer
and
it
isnt
bad
it
isnt
as
smooth
as
some
other
winter
warmers
i
have
had
in
the
past
this
might
be
nice
to
have
just
during
the
winter
for
something
different
nice
and
light
mild
maltyness
detect
spices
but
not
as
strong
as
one
would
think
as
they
call
out
on
the
label
pours
like
a
flat
beer
but
has
enough
carbination
to
satisfy
nice
color
nice
alcohol
percentage
overall
just
nice
and
not
notable
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
darm
amber
almost
cola
color
with
little
to
no
head
what
so
ever
the
smell
was
alcohol
and
malt
the
taste
on
this
was
very
bland
with
a
malty
taste
not
quite
what
was
expected
from
this
style
needs
spice
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
with
a
little
bit
of
a
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
overall
this
is
not
the
best
beer
by
pyramid
i
expected
more
and
came
up
dissappointed
i
would
hope
they
change
their
receipe
up
year
to
year
becuase
this
one
just
didnt
cut
it
rich
taste
malty
more
alcohol
toffee
and
a
mild
roasted
flavor
rather
drying
in
the
finish
sweetness
is
restrained
and
doesnt
approach
cloying
body
is
medium
and
smooth
and
dryness
and
light
bitter
in
the
end
are
enjoyable
i
tend
to
sip
this
one
but
like
to
have
2
or
3
in
an
evening
good
beer
a
mustget
for
me
each
year
d
pretty
good
a
litle
strong
but
i
could
have
2
or
3
drinkability
low
this
is
a
mediocre
winter
warmer
with
the
requisite
spices
and
malt
but
little
else
in
the
way
of
uniqueness
or
innovation
would
not
get
again
da
slow
drinker
but
not
overfilling
nor
overwhelming
not
an
obvious
session
beer
but
each
beer
is
better
than
the
one
before
ill
enjoy
a
few
hours
of
smooth
sippin
pours
a
dark
cherry
brown
with
a
thick
head
of
off
white
bubbles
starts
with
a
big
spicy
and
over
ripe
plum
aroma
as
it
warms
it
seems
to
turn
more
to
a
light
gingersnap
cookie
and
malt
aroma
taste
is
initially
malt
and
plum
but
quickly
the
spice
takes
over
the
aftertaste
sensation
is
similar
to
the
drying
you
get
from
cinnamon
not
over
the
top
in
spices
solid
winter
brew
pours
a
rubybrown
in
color
there
was
a
nice
off
white
head
sitting
atop
smell
is
spruce
tree
and
clove
taste
is
much
the
same
with
more
malt
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
highly
sessionable
decent
tastes
like
most
other
holiday
beers
nothing
great
but
not
too
shabby
the
nose
was
its
best
attribute
but
it
isnt
backed
up
in
the
flavor
now
it
tastes
like
its
in
the
250
calorie
range
so
i
guess
id
have
to
add
another
10
minutes
to
my
lunchtime
workout
then
wouldnt
i
oh
the
trauma
i
didnt
find
the
flavor
to
be
the
most
complex
for
the
style
not
a
lot
of
flavors
stood
out
but
it
was
still
tasty
and
wellbalanced
it
was
a
clear
ruby
red
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
mixed
spice
and
a
hint
of
hops
those
hops
came
out
in
the
flavor
more
than
youd
expect
making
his
a
relatively
hoppy
winter
warmer
i
enjoyed
that
aspect
and
felt
it
complimented
the
mild
caramel
malt
and
spices
pyrmaid
hails
this
as
a
full
bodied
winter
warmer
and
i
in
turn
raise
a
tasty
pint
and
hollar
here
here
da
solid
winter
offering
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
anticipated
favorites
of
the
holiday
season
while
i
always
feel
that
pyramids
other
offerings
are
good
at
best
snowcap
always
exceeds
nicely
a
true
standout
in
a
sea
of
typical
winter
warmers
ive
had
several
old
ale
styles
this
winter
and
this
one
was
my
favorite
the
flavor
is
definitely
complex
it
feels
like
spices
were
used
but
not
overdone
there
is
definitely
a
good
amount
of
warming
going
on
finally
as
an
old
ale
style
it
didnt
seem
as
watered
down
as
some
of
the
other
old
ale
styles
i
tried
body
a
bit
light
for
the
style
with
average
drinkability
at
7
this
is
a
good
deal
for
the
price
but
i
sure
wouldnt
want
a
whole
6er
dthis
is
quite
a
nice
beer
not
an
over
the
top
ww
in
an
area
but
i
guess
that
makes
it
quite
drinkable
would
be
a
welcome
sight
in
anyones
holiday
beverage
selection
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbation
is
good
its
fairly
drinkable
id
drink
more
if
i
liked
it
a
little
better
overall
its
decent
certainly
not
my
favorite
holiday
brew
but
not
bad
thanks
to
biegaman
for
this
sourvenir
of
his
san
francisco
jaunt
in
late
october
poured
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
halffinger
tan
head
that
settled
quickly
very
little
lacing
and
the
carbonation
revealed
only
under
a
very
bright
light
was
minimal
slow
and
lazy
the
nose
was
spicy
nutmeg
perhaps
cinammon
thyme
the
taste
was
oaky
warm
malt
with
balanced
bitterness
and
a
pleasant
lingering
spicy
finish
buttery
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
thanks
jan
aftertaste
is
a
bit
hoppy
and
sharp
with
a
little
sweetness
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
winter
warmer
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
present
in
the
taste
but
im
not
feeling
it
yet
maybe
a
couple
more
will
bed
me
down
this
is
another
winter
beer
from
the
northwest
seattle
to
be
exact
i
did
visit
this
brewery
this
year
right
across
the
street
from
the
seattle
mariners
stadium
in
seattle
this
beer
however
i
bought
in
a
six
pack
here
in
mcminnville
oregon
good
winter
beer
not
my
favorite
but
very
drinkable
a
little
darker
than
some
of
the
others
from
this
area
but
not
so
bitter
all
in
all
a
decent
warmer
nice
with
a
cookie
to
offset
the
harsh
aftertaste
worth
a
shot
ive
had
this
many
times
over
the
years
and
im
just
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
back
in
the
day
this
was
one
of
the
better
winter
options
now
its
been
eclispsed
by
so
many
other
choices
pours
a
very
dar
brown
almost
black
thin
head
and
some
lacing
smells
fruity
and
there
are
notes
of
sweet
malt
and
some
spicy
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
similar
with
an
edge
to
it
and
some
almost
burnt
toffee
flavors
as
well
mouthfeel
is
spicy
and
a
little
rough
one
of
their
best
offerings
and
not
bad
tastes
of
toasted
malts
with
a
light
touch
of
chocolate
spices
at
the
very
end
your
palette
will
pick
up
the
citus
from
the
hops
this
is
quite
different
from
the
other
winter
warmers
ive
tried
so
far
and
worth
a
try
well
recommended
if
you
like
easy
drinking
beers
of
this
style
appearance
is
a
dark
rubybrown
color
head
retention
medium
smells
of
wood
aromas
malts
slightly
carameltoffe
hints
tastes
sweet
slight
coffee
flavors
coming
through
very
malty
character
bitter
notes
on
the
end
very
spicy
and
warm
on
the
finish
spicy
in
your
throat
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
the
spiciness
of
the
beer
makes
it
nice
to
sip
slowly
i
wasnt
blown
away
but
not
horrible
there
are
much
better
winter
warmers
available
this
beer
needs
to
balance
out
the
alcohol
a
little
bit
better
not
bad
though
i
like
it
but
its
nothing
special
that
is
i
wouldnt
anticipate
its
arrival
every
year
but
will
have
it
at
a
bar
if
i
saw
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
colour
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
a
clean
glass
with
no
hint
of
lace
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
nose
but
very
tasty
all
the
same
strong
malt
flavours
and
a
good
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
more
substantial
definitely
not
an
allnight
beer
but
a
nice
one
to
round
off
a
session
with
d
not
the
best
winter
brew
out
there
a
little
too
bitter
at
the
end
ruins
the
whole
beer
for
me
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
the
taste
roasty
malt
and
a
light
cinnamon
spice
a
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
cinnamon
and
a
green
apple
aftertaste
very
porter
like
with
hints
of
spice
and
fruitiness
light
and
easy
to
drink
drinks
very
easy
for
the
abv
this
years
offering
is
better
than
lasts
if
you
like
winter
warmers
with
some
hop
zip
give
this
one
a
go
pours
a
muddyish
ruby
brown
with
a
somewhat
lasting
beige
head
smell
is
charred
malt
and
tartness
taste
is
similar
with
charred
flavors
tart
semitoasty
malt
and
a
strong
alcohol
presence
overall
just
too
thin
and
alcoholic
needs
more
body
to
support
the
alchol
presence
to
be
enjoyable
but
that
is
the
style
i
guess
drinkable
but
not
particularly
good
a
little
bit
sweet
a
little
spicy
almost
no
alcohol
taste
pretty
easy
drinking
and
for
2
for
a
bomber
bonus
not
my
favorite
winter
brew
but
super
way
to
start
my
night
im
glad
i
gave
this
brew
another
chance
and
had
one
this
year
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
moderately
dry
the
finish
is
clean
with
a
bit
of
warmth
and
moderate
carbonation
tasty
but
nothing
too
impressive
d
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
but
certainly
not
the
best
it
wasnt
spicy
enough
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
thin
cola
color
head
settles
very
quickly
aroma
is
faint
of
cinnamon
and
sweet
malty
goodness
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
some
oakey
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
somewhat
fizzy
finish
drinkability
is
quite
good
abv
not
terribly
noticeable
its
relatively
inexpensive
only
1
99
for
this
22oz
bottle
d
a
little
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
very
nice
at
7
00
this
doesnt
taste
like
it
flavor
balanced
and
intersting
enough
to
make
this
more
drinkable
thatn
7
overall
its
pretty
good
i
guess
it
has
no
clear
problems
but
i
do
feel
a
bit
underwelmed
ive
had
this
beer
a
number
of
times
from
the
bottle
draught
and
kegs
at
house
parties
and
have
always
thought
it
was
a
tasty
full
bodied
winter
warmer
that
was
still
remarkably
easy
drinking
sorry
but
im
going
against
the
grain
on
this
one
dont
get
this
if
you
can
avoid
it
the
body
was
lighter
then
i
expected
but
it
was
fairly
creamy
and
the
carbonation
fit
overall
drinkable
if
not
very
complex
or
exciting
certainly
the
least
disappointing
experience
with
this
brewery
in
my
backyard
i
would
not
buy
a
six
pack
but
if
you
can
buy
a
single
do
it
try
it
and
judge
for
yourself
could
not
drink
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
d
great
for
a
winter
warmer
each
sip
keeps
you
wanting
more
my
favourite
brew
by
far
from
pyramid
a
great
example
of
a
winter
warmer
one
of
the
best
out
there
d
pretty
good
brew
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
pyramid
d
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
winter
special
too
sweet
to
be
enjoyable
much
better
winter
brews
out
there
beer
poured
a
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
off
white
head
that
has
a
very
thin
layer
barely
floating
nose
is
very
malty
but
i
am
not
picking
up
on
any
seasonal
spices
taste
is
not
overly
complex
very
malty
with
a
hint
of
spice
dark
fruit
and
molasses
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
overall
drinkabilty
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
nice
seasonal
that
is
worth
a
shot
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
aroma
was
a
nice
sweetness
with
definate
fruit
undertones
the
prevelant
aroma
was
of
bananas
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
smell
banana
but
mostly
a
carmelized
brown
sugar
flavoring
there
were
hints
of
spice
but
it
was
mostly
sweet
not
sickly
or
overpowering
sweet
but
a
nice
flavor
very
nice
in
the
mouth
slight
tingle
to
the
tounge
no
excess
carbonation
in
the
sipping
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
surprise
beer
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
really
tasty
everything
is
well
put
together
and
well
balanced
some
nice
subtle
touches
here
and
there
its
most
of
what
i
like
in
a
beer
i
could
put
down
a
couple
of
these
mouthfeel
was
zesty
yet
somewhat
slick
medium
to
full
in
body
d
surprisingly
drinkable
the
dry
finish
leaves
you
wanting
more
while
the
balance
of
flavors
makes
this
one
a
good
choice
for
seconds
my
first
beer
from
pyramid
and
hey
im
impressed
although
this
is
hardly
a
sipper
i
could
nurse
a
few
of
these
on
a
blustery
winters
night
this
brew
is
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
dark
fruit
aroma
and
a
thin
tan
head
the
color
is
so
dark
that
at
times
it
seems
nearly
black
the
smell
is
a
complex
mix
of
malt
and
fruit
cherry
is
a
particular
stand
out
all
of
which
is
backed
by
slightly
muted
a
spicy
aroma
no
presence
of
alcohol
in
the
smell
but
after
half
a
glass
the
beer
is
certainly
warming
the
taste
is
dominated
by
a
maltiness
and
considerable
residual
sweetness
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
in
the
mouth
which
corresponds
nicely
to
the
fullbodied
brew
its
not
overthetop
but
is
very
well
done
i
enjoyed
the
spiciness
and
the
fruit
in
the
forefront
not
much
of
a
wow
factor
with
this
beer
just
solid
drinkability
a
delicious
winter
warmer
that
captures
the
holiday
spirit
in
a
glass
snow
cap
pours
into
a
glass
topped
with
a
semidense
tan
head
nestled
atop
an
amberbrown
body
the
nose
is
complimented
with
spices
perhaps
a
mix
of
spices
vanilla
cinnamon
the
mouthfeel
warms
as
it
goes
down
providing
a
drinkable
beer
for
those
long
winter
months
dark
chestnut
with
a
slight
ruby
tinge
and
a
small
fizzy
tan
head
that
quickly
and
fully
diminishes
very
little
few
spots
of
lacing
smells
kind
of
musty
and
stale
even
though
its
not
old
and
i
doubt
the
sixpack
shop
associated
with
zenos
in
state
college
pa
mishandled
it
no
i
think
it
just
has
a
kind
of
funky
smell
not
the
whole
bouquet
just
a
little
just
enough
to
knock
things
out
of
whack
otherwise
its
a
decent
roasted
malt
aroma
toffee
nuts
some
light
spicy
hops
some
very
light
doughy
yeast
and
a
small
zing
of
currant
the
taste
follows
suit
there
are
some
good
characteristics
to
this
beer
but
something
is
just
off
off
taste
and
off
balance
even
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
off
being
too
slick
and
syrupy
for
my
taste
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
but
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
either
cheers
drinkability
i
was
prepared
to
be
underwhelmed
but
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
not
in
the
top
drawer
im
afraid
this
is
not
a
bad
winter
brew
but
it
is
too
spicy
for
my
tastes
if
you
are
after
that
do
give
this
a
try
glad
i
grabbed
a
6
of
these
too
bad
i
cant
bring
any
home
to
nh
in
my
carry
on
due
to
the
non
drinking
crowd
from
you
know
where
part
of
a
mixed
case
of
winter
beers
i
got
over
the
christmas
holiday
this
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
medium
thickness
tan
head
the
nose
was
a
bit
strong
with
a
malty
sweet
touch
and
some
spice
notes
the
taste
also
had
an

no

of
and
a
nice
sugary
sweet

from
the
7
abv
fill
the
mouth
nicely
i
would
surmise
that
there
are
much
better
winter
warmers
out
there
but
this
is
not
bad
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
thanks
to
my
brother
for
getting
me
a
single
for
xmas
poured
out
a
dark
dark
brown
looks
like
coke
a
cola
with
a
tiny
little
non
existent
spattering
of
a
i
hate
to
call
it
head
the
nose
offers
some
woodnyess
malt
alcohol
and
sherry
the
taste
is
rather
tame
rounded
out
malt
and
biscuit
notes
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
a
slightly
spicywoodyastringent
border
on
the
palate
the
mouthfell
is
slick
and
mildly
carbonated
fairly
drinkable
beer
good
for
a
winter
warmer
near
the
fireplace
adam
d
slightly
above
average
drinkabilty
good
for
a
winter
warmer
d
it
could
be
worse
i
dont
think
i
will
have
it
again
since
i
dont
care
for
a
winter
warmer
that
is
full
of
a
grassy
lager
flavor
d
the
only
thing
i
really
noticed
missing
was
any
wintery
spice
i
guess
ive
grown
accustomed
to
some
spices
in
my
winter
brews
but
beside
that
an
enjoyable
selection
2006
edition
pours
a
deep
mohogany
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
full
of
cinnamon
and
other
spices
very
nice
taste
is
well
rounded
with
plenty
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
alcohol
is
pronounced
well
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
and
average
overall
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
and
one
that
i
will
return
to
again
each
winter
overall
another
decent
winter
warmer
this
past
season
this
was
just
a
notch
below
the
anchor
xmas
mouthfeel
is
thin
at
first
but
tacky
and
dry
at
the
finish
as
long
as
you
keep
drinking
its
bearable
drinkability
is
okay
for
this
alcohol
content
and
the
nice
smell
lures
you
back
for
what
its
worth
pretty
good
but
not
for
sessions
would
probably
pair
very
well
with
heavier
meats
and
cheeses
a
bit
malty
for
my
preference
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
another
notes
a
well
crafted
winter
warmer
and
really
fits
the
style
to
a
t
in
my
opinion
to
me
this
is
could
be
a
standard
bearer
to
judge
others
against
overall
a
bit
darker
and
biitterer
than
i
expect
from
my
winter
warmers
but
its
still
a
decent
beer
with
original
flavor
and
a
solid
kick
d
very
drinkable
just
nothing
spectacular
i
wouldnt
order
it
again
maybe
if
i
was
closer
to
the
brewery
i
would
have
it
again
but
since
im
in
ny
i
cant
imagine
it
was
all
that
fresh
either
a
great
winter
warmer
good
job
pyramid
d
not
an
awful
beer
at
all
but
still
it
seems
like
it
needs
something
more
perhaps
citrus
hops
or
more
complexity
from
the
malts
right
now
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
highly
carbonated
salad
dressing
rather
than
the
beer
i
so
desired
still
though
i
will
finish
the
glass
without
a
problem
as
this
beer
does
not
merit
a
trip
down
the
drain
though
i
will
confess
i
feel
like
im
about
to
break
a
sweat
its
just
one
of
those
beer
where
you
kind
of
shrug
and
finish
it
nothing
stellar
but
its
something
else
to
try
so
ill
mark
this
one
down
as
a
why
not
beer
overall
a
very
flavorful
but
severely
unbalanced
ale
id
swear
this
baby
tastes
like
10
abv
or
more
with
its
alcohol
flavor
and
warmth
the
hops
are
very
nice
i
just
wish
they
had
something
else
to
bounceoff
of
besides
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
pours
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
patchy
head
with
some
lacing
smell
is
malts
coffee
and
some
fruit
roasted
flavors
dominate
with
some
sweetness
medium
bodied
overall
not
very
impressive
i
expected
a
lot
more
complexity
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
no
head
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
hard
to
detect
but
what
is
there
is
mostly
from
the
spices
the
flavor
is
very
interesting
not
exactly
the
flavor
you
would
expect
from
such
a
dark
beer
just
like
a
pale
ale
but
with
holiday
spices
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
added
a
very
interesting
combination
and
a
tasty
one
at
that
this
will
definitely
be
added
to
my
list
of
beers
to
get
during
the
holiday
season
although
i
could
only
drink
one
or
two
at
a
time
this
makes
for
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
dark
evening
slainte
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
better
this
one
just
seemed
bitter
with
no
balance
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
beersdelicious
mouthwateringdont
want
to
stop
drinking
this
beer
give
it
a
try

flavors
of

a
very

beer
it
is
well
balanced
and
has
a
nice
flavor
the
best
snow
cap
from
pyramid
that
i
have
had
so
far
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
minimal
14
tan

over
the
clear
burgundy
brew
head
is
down
to
a
skim
of
swirly
bubbles
in
a
flash
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
deeply
of
grains
with
a
light
fruity
note
flavor
is
malty
upfront
with
the
fruitiness
in
the
middle
and
reverts
back
to
the
grains
for
the
close
and
aftertaste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
okay
but
again
this
year
this
one
doesnt
wow
me
it
does
seem
better
fresher
as
expected
which
is
a
good
thing
to
note
single
bottle
from
whole
foods
raleigh
not
bad
none
of
snow
caps
characteristics
stood
out
in
crazygood
sort
of
way
it
was
however
very
well
balanced
and
a
wonderful
drink
the
malt
and
hops
complement
each
other
nicely
i
think
it
makes
a
good
contribution
to
the
world
of
winter
warmers
all
in
all
an
above
average
and
drinkable
winter
brew
but
it
just
lacks
a
bit
of
a
kick
that
i
would
hope
for
from
a
warmer
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
most
pyramid
brews
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
wow
what
a
stinker
i
dont
know
what
they
were
thinking
with
this
one
but
its
a
complete
mess
i
had
to
dump
it
in
the
yard
as
even
my
drain
didnt
want
to
drink
it
d
not
bad
this
is
a
standard
winter
brew
with
decent
characteristics
not
in
the
elite
but
still
enjoyable
although
not
evident
in
my
review
when
you
put
it
all
together
the
damn
thing
tastes
kind
of
like
a
porter
there
is
ail
bet
this
is
going
to
age
well
single
bottle
bought
at
a
woodmans
in
wisconsin
this
bottle
was
on
sale
big
time
and
i
suspect
it
had
lived
beyond
its
intended
years
poured
deep
red
with
a
nice
small
head

at
the
lack
of
carbonation
actually
malty
slightly
spicey
clove

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
hitime
cellars
costa
mesa
ca
this
is
a
great
beer
rich
malty
and
packs
a
kick
in
late
nov
this
beer
really
warms
the
stomach
and
makes
any
football
game
more
enjoyable
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
with
traces
of
ruby
and
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
was
not
very
stong
but
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
these
carried
over
to
create
a
good
flavor
and
the
7
alcohol
was
evident
but
not
overwhelming
this
was
better
than
i
expected
and
i
had
it
in
may
could
appreciate
even
more
in
winter
as
this
being
my
first
pyramid
i
was
quite
suprised
take
note
that
this
beer
has
been
aging
for
over
7
months
now
yet
somehow
it
tastes
nearly
identical
to
a
dogfish
head
indian
brown
ale
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
not
bad
but
the
flavors
are
a
little
muddled
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
blah
as
well
pours
an
almost
purple
color
with
an
offwhite
head
spotty
lacing
lot
of
malt
in
the
nose
with
some
hints
of
spice
and
a
background
of
alcohol
flavor
is
a
big
presence
of
malt
and
dried
fruit
followed
by
hop
bitterness
but
not
much
hop
flavor
to
talk
about
bitterness
lingers
along
with
the
malt
sweetness
while
a
mild
spicing
makes
itself
known
kind
of
makes
me
think
of
a
barleywine
jr
with
spice
added
mouthfeel
is
moderate
but
the
carbonation
could
have
been
a
little
smoother
for
my
taste
tasty
beer
but
i
somehow
dont
feel
very
motivated
to
drink
more
than
this
one
bottle
draught
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
and
is
topped
with
a
small
tan
head
it
leaves
lots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
somewhat
spicy
and
malty
perhaps
a
touch
of
cinnamon
in
there
the
body
is
a
little
on
the
richer
side
with
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
balanced
nicely
with
some
hop
spiciness
maybe
just
a
hint
of
roastiness
i
dont
know
if
you
would
want
to
call
a
7
beer
a
session
beer
but
this
goes
down
really
easy
now
i
know
why
my
friends
in
the
northwest
put
this
stuff
away
for
later
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
short
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
d
drinkable
this
is
the
best
brew
from
pyramid
in
my
book
very
tasty
and
at
only
7
abv
you
can
have
a
few
mouthfeel
almsot
wanna
say
oily
but
just
a
little
i
guess
pretty
ocunbtry
kitchen
as
far
as
palate
goes
but
does
have
good
coverage
of
the
tongue
cheers
drinkability
the
taste
seemed
much
different
than
the
aroma
so
i
didnt
like
it
at
first
but
after
sipping
on
this
one
it
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
beer
not
as
good
as
the
goose
island
christmas
ale
that
i
had
2
weeks
ago
but
still
a
good
brew
all
and
all
a
good
beer
but
it
almost
pushed
from
a
winter
warmer
to
an
ipa
still
very
drinkable
from
either
standpoint
this
is
a
beer
that
drinks
like
a
meal
very
filling
its
drinkable
but
after
just
one
i
was
ready
for
a
nap
coffeelike
color
a
clear
brown
with
red
hues
the
faintest
of
a
head
disappears
fast
the
smell
is
cinnamonlike
and
sweet
but
very
very
faint
the
malt
flavor
is
sweet
and
toasty
with
a
pepperyspicy
cinnamon
taste
the
finish
seems
to
be
moderately
bitter
giving
it
some
nice
balance
thickness
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
nice
this
beer
was
dark
enough
and
bitter
enough
for
my
liking
but
could
have
yielded
a
better
appearance
and
aroma
a
pleasant
winter
warmer
overall
the
carbonation
seems
high
and
deters
from
the
taste
i
would
have
liked
more
of
a
creamy
taste
but
still
and
enjoyable
beer
the
abv
isnt
a
deterrent
and
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
deep
mahongany
brown
slightly
hazy
the
nose
is
slightly
fruity
ditto
on
the
palate
where
a
citrus
peel
fruit
element
is
combined
with
some
maltiness
the
carbonation
is
spritzy
the
mouthfeel
average
so
this
is
a
holiday
beer
well
at
least
its
7
abv
very
filling
and
with
a
high
abv
this
beer
is
good
for
no
more
than
two
bottles
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
half
inch
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
and
cocoa
this
brew
however
feels
kind
of
thin
to
me
its
not
nearly
as
thick
and
full
bodied
as
i
remember
it
being
i
wonder
if
pyramid
has
changed
the
recipe
for
this
beer
the
last
time
i
had
it
in
the
late
90s
it
had
way
more
hop
character
too
its
still
a
decent
brew
just
not
one
that
im
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
acquire
pours
an
opaque
brown
color
with
a
medium
thin
offwhite
head
that
disappears
steadily
not
a
lot
of
lacing
after
the
first
layer
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
spices
the
flavor
is
nutty
and
malty
with
some
nutmeg
and
other
sweet
spices
the
finish
is
sweet
and
nutty
with
a
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
i
havent
had
one
of
these
for
a
couple
years
and
still
think
it
is
above
average
pours

and
dark

holds
well

a
few
sticky
patches
of

roasted
barley
and
caramel
nose
with
a
faint
dextrin
scent
and
lots
of
holiday
spice
aromas
like
ginger
cloves
and
cinnamon
big
roasted
flavor
accompanied
by
a
crystal
malt
sweetness
ginger
flavor
arrives
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
dryed
out
by
nobleesque
hops
that
will
become
slightly
chalky
the
mouthfeel
is
otherwise
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
a
good
balance
but
the
cloying
flavor
of
stale
hops
gets
annoying
near
the
finish
but
this
is
a
fine
seasonal
and
has
so
many
pleasent
characteristics
you
dont
really
notice
the
imperfections
unless
youre
looking
mouthfeel
equally
as
interesting
alcoholic
creamy
bubblely
then
down
the
hatch
its
warming
perhaps
thats
why
its
known
as
a
winter
warmer
cheers
coffeebrown
body
with
ruby
underglow
head
was
virtually
unpresent
and
turned
to
a
very
thin
film
the
aroma
full
of
roasted
malt
and
spices
the
spices
turned
strong
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
a
cloying
amount
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
make
this
a
little
undrinkable
the
bad
bittering
hops
do
not
compliment
the
selection
of
malt
and
spices
at
all
not
a
good
beer
tastewise
a
dark

close
to
brown
covered
with
a
snow
cap
of
head
that
yeilds
nice
lacing
smell
is
nutty
with
a
little
ginger
in
the
maltyness
a
decent
flavor
of
slight
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
background
a
good
solid
body
helps
this
beer
out
not
something
i
would
mind
having
again
the
biggest
drawback
for
me
with
the
pyramid
snow
cap
was
that
i
had
just
tried
for
the
first
time
the
very
tasty
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
pyramid
has
yet
to
impress
me
from
their
apricot
ale
to
the
hefes
so
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
was
pretty
much
right
avergae
mouthfeel
not
as
tasty
as
sam
adams
winter
warmer
even
only
paid
2
75
for
this
bottle
at
apub
so
that
was
okay
but
there
are
much
better
winter
warmers
out
there
id
say
this
is
better
than
most
winter
warmers
ive
had
but
not
as
good
as
a
few
others
above
average
topped
with
a
short
noisy
head
of
small
and
medium
eggshell
colored
bubbles
that
quickly
disappear
leaving
a
thin
collar
the
beer
is
a
rubied
amber
with
mahogany
highlights
slightly
hazed
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
hints
of
gingerbread
and
holiday
cookie
spice
the
taste
is
initially
malty
with
those
same
cookie
spice
notes
but
it
finishes
distinctly
hoppy
in
a
passiveaggressive
way
but
also
in
a
noncomplimentary
way
the
hops
do
not
compliment
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
overall
it
does
not
mesh
well
it
has
a
medium
body
that
feels
a
bit
thin
on
the
tongue
there
is
fine
soft
carbonation
it
smells
much
better
than
it
tastes
unfortunately
the
drinkability
is
only
ok
and
i
guess
i
could
get
used
to
the
weird
hop
finish
i
remember
earlier
versions
of
this
beer
tasting
simply
wonderful
perhaps
next
years
release
will
be
modified
this
is
a
drinkable
winter
ale
and
at
a
fairly
low
price
point
i
got
a
six
pack
for
6
50
as
dark
ales
go
id
say
it
is
average
at
best
i
think
there
are
other
comparable
warmers
that
are
better
i
wouldnt
pour
snow
cap
down
the
sink
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
if
you
like
a
really
bitter
dark
brew
this
ones
for
you
this
beer
pours
a
nonhazed
darkbrown
with
a
very
small
head
the
aroma
consists
of
slight
roasty
notes
with
hints
of
light
roasty
malt
the
taste
is
more
of
the
roasted
malts
and
spices
with
hops
in
the
distant
background
the
dry
powdery
spices
are
very
pronounced
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
that
finishes
slightly
sweet
not
a
bad
beer
but
complexity
is
not
its
strong
suit
cheers
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
meduim
plus
body
the
carbonation
is
proper
this
is
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
experience
by
any
measure
i
look
forward
to
next
years
batch
a
good
winter
warmer
that
reminds
me
of
a
miniarogant
bastard
though
it
has
the
alcohol
the
malts
and
hops
are
not
as
bold
or
as
melded
the
beer
has
good
spices
and
herbs
to
accent
the
hops
it
carries
a
dark
malt
cherry
and
nutty
flavor
alcoholic
from
sniff
to
finish
hopped
well
for
a
dry
finish
while
remaining
malty
good
stuff
ill
have
another
mouthfeel
is
toasty
sweet
again
with
that
bitter
chocolate
feel
and
nuts
lingering
along
the
palate
dark
brownish
orange
with
a
tawny
head
that
dissipates
and
provides
low
lacing
smells
of
malty
malt
very
slight
citrus
brown
sugars
taste
is
of
mostly
malt
you
feel
the
sweet
grain
sticking
onto
the
tongue
the
hops
are
too
light
to
completely
wash
the
mouth
free
of
the
sweetness
it
doesnt
taste
like
its
that
strong
but
it
feels
like
it
i
enjoy
it
and
will
be
getting
more
next
winter
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
frothy
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
one
of
the
few
winter
warmers
that
actually
had
an
abv
high
enough
to
provide
an
actually
warming
affect
but
not
too
much
that
it
overpowered
flavour
is
mostly
malts
with
only
a
slight
hop
spice
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
very
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
makes
it
more
of
a
sipping
beer
or
evening
ender
over
all
an
above
average
xmas
beer
for
me
but
theres
a
few
better
thumbs
down
on
this
one
the
bloodhound
factor
benji
drank
it
all
and
begged
for
more
peaches
didnt
get
any
and
left
sad
and
sober
an
ok
winter
brew
ive
had
it
ontap
a
few
times
in
the
past
and
liked
it
at
about
the
same
im
liking
it
out
of
the
bottle
very
pleasant
beer
in
the
drinkability
department
tasty
without
killing
you
with
sweetness
this
is
a
winter
beer
that
is
better
suited
to
adults
taste
buds
assertive
bitter
finish
is
a
nice
surprise
and
i
do
believe
that
this
is
the
highest
score
i
have
ever
given
to
a
beer
from
this
brewery
pleasantly
surprised
with
my
first
try
of
pyramid
brews
pump
up
the
malts
a
little
more
and
theyd
have
themselves
a
fantastic
winter
brew
drinkability
it
has
great
character
and
is
a
great
drink
to
have
during
the
winter
months
probably
wouldnt
have
it
in
the
summer
however
i
would
get
it
again
in
the
future
drinkability
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
there
is
nothing
about
this
beer
that
would
discourage
me
from
picking
it
up
again
it
is
not
perfect
but
it
is
plenty
good
i
never
realized
that
winter
warmer
was
an
actual
style
i
once
considered
a
heavily
alcoholic
robust
fire
side
sipper
a
winter
warmer
i
guess
i
was
sorely
mistaken
snow
cap
was
quite
an
interesting
experience
with
strong
dark
qualities
and
festive
fruitiness
i
am
somewhat
perplexed
and
intrigued
by
it
hmmm
pours
a
crystal
brown
with
a
stunning
red
glow
and
a
frothy
tan
head
smells
of
fruity
hops
and
sweet
malt
not
too
much
there
i
got
light
headed
huffing
this
stuff
trying
to
extract
the
aroma
whats
there
is
nice
but
theres
just
not
much
of
it
there
flavor
consisted
of
pungent
dry
hops
with
a
light
chocolate
malt
a
few
slight
spices
and
a
huge
dry
finish
mouth
feel
as
a
little
on
the
light
side
with
mild
carbonation
drinkability
whats
with
all
this
metal
im
drinking
tonight
whats
the
tsa
going
to
do
to
me
at
the
airport
i
shudder
to
think
are
they
just
cranking
out
their
seasonal
brews
to
get
them
on
the
shelves
truth
be
told
the
metallica
of
this
brew
is
not
as
overwhleming
as
in
the
sam
adams
winter
lager
i
tasted
three
seasonals
ago
not
bad
ive
been
enjoying
these
all
year
but
now
it
is
september
the
last
one
i
had
was
probably
july
and
it
was
enjoyable
tonight
i
opened
the
last
one
in
the
fridge
and
it
was
undrinkable
for
me
so
just
as
a
point
of
reference
6
months
maximum
for
cellaring
imho
snow
cap
has
a
dark
nutty
brown
color
with
a
small
and
creamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
malt
smell
toasted
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
touches
of
dry
hoppy
smells
are
noted
in
the
background
a
sip
starts
with
sweet
malt
flavors
caramel
and
molasses
stand
out
among
a
standard
sweet
malt
body
a
piney
hop
taste
is
also
in
the
mix
but
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
malts
towards
the
finish
a
vague
dark
fruit
flavor
pops
out
alongside
a
vague
alcohol
taste
the
finish
concludes
with
a
caramel
sweetness
overall
snow
cap
has
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
but
the
overall
experience
is
a
little
thinflavored
especially
in
the
middle
of
a
sip
if
pyramid
pumped
up
the
malt
flavor
a
bit
this
could
be
an
excellent
winter
beer
medium
bodied
although
well
balanced
the
flavors
are
a
little
rough
and
the
alcohol
is
too
apparent
but
is
is
drinkable
and
warming
slàinte
but
wear
a
jacket
its
cold
out
there
this
beers
mouthfeel
is
about
its
only
strong
suit
i
cant
really
even
describe
the
taste
of
this
beer
other
than
it
was
an
evolution
of
flavors
it
started
creamy
and
fruity
and
less
bitter
than
a
porter
but
became
more
bitter
yet
refreshing
and
warming
as
the
taste
lingered
it
was
refreshing
fruity
roasty
and
in
general
completely
different
than
any
beer
ive
had
especially
a
winter
yet
another
reason
i
love
beer
predispositions
to
breweries
or
styles
can
be
crushed
just
like
that
check
this
one
out
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
recedes
quickly
aroma
is
pretty
simple
some
piney
hops
dark
and
roasted
malt
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
has
some
roasted
malt
notes
toasted
bread
spices
a
bit
of
hops
and
some
alcohol
boring
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
drinkability
is
not
very
good
never
been
impressed
with
any
pyramid
brew
and
this
doesnt
change
that
cheers
drinks
pretty
handily
id
recommend
trying
it
with
cookies
as
i
am
mine
overall
impression
decent
winter
warmer
not
the
most
exciting
one
out
there
but
worth
a
try
drinkability
easy
enough
but
pretty
boring
overall
maybe
a
good
winter
beer
for
noncraft
beer
fans
probably
wont
revisit
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
garnet
highlights
and
a
onefinger
tan
head
creamy
with
large
bubbles
sweet
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
some
chestnut
and
brown
sugar
notes
palate
is
full
of
roasted
dark
malt
tempered
by
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
notes
of
brown
sugar
plum
and
dry
ale
yeast
are
present
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
which
is
a
bit
of
a
curveball
but
pleasant
medium
creamy
body
is
just
a
tad
thin
for
the
style
though
still
substantial
an
enjoyable
seasonal
ale
and
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
a
usually
mediore
brewery
d
yes
this
is
a
great
seasonal
and
it
does
have
pricedrinkability
to
rate
it
is
a
buyagain
beer
ill
let
you
know
dark
marron
colored
body
almost
black
until
held
up
to
the
light
smell
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
brown
sugar
and
spices
akin
to
a
dopplebock
in
smell
taste
is
also
very
sweet
and
big
yet
smooth
and
slightly
woody
i
am
having
this
beer
almost
a
year
after
it
was
brewed
and
it
has
retained
a
very
satisfying
flavor
very
roasty
with
a
little
coffee
flavor
but
also
sweet
and
spiced
would
be
a
great
midwinter
nights
sipper
but
it
is
still
good
on
an
unseasonably
warm
october
day
a
decent
middleoftheroad
winter
warmer
a
well
crafted
brew
a
nice
warm
and
cold
weather
companion
picked
up
a
single
at
the
beer
store
today
never
seen
it
before
but
im
sure
its
been
there
a
while
a
winter
warmer
in
july
hmmm
why
not
anyway
it
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
when
held
to
the
light
it
reminds
me
of
stained
wood
the
smell
is
terrific
notes
of
coffee
and
bittersweet
malts
put
a
grin
on
my
face
it
tastes
nice
as
well
i
dont
think
the
little
bit
of
aging
has
hurt
this
one
at
all
the
flavor
is
choppy
and
bitter
at
first
but
finishes
warm
and
smooth
i
notice
bitter
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
coffee
and
malts
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
between
the
infinite
space
that
lies
between
medium
and
heavy
bodied
the
drinkablility
is
good
for
one
or
two
but
enjoy
them
slowly
this
one
is
warm
going
down
impressive
beer
here
maybe
not
an
elitist
brew
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
poured
with
a
noticible
lack
of
head
just
some
light
wispiness
despite
a
vigorous
pour
the
nose
was
a
really
sweet
malty
character
and
the
color
was
a
deep
red
bordering
on
brown
like
mahogany
there
were
lots
of
big
flavors
including
chocolate
anise
and
spice
maybe
cinnamon
on
the
tongue
it
had
a
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
the
chocolate
and
anise
really
stood
out
on
the
finish
and
aftertaste
with
a
mild
hoppiness
accompanying
this
was
a
really
good
drink
even
aged
and
at
the
height
of
summer
this
is
an
ok
thing
to
be
drinking
but
its
nothing
special
if
its
handy
at
the
bar
and
its
decently
priced
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
but
it
isnt
worth
seeking
out
a
very
dark
amber
almost
brown
hued
winter
warmer
pours
with
plenty
of
foam
not
much
in
the
aroma
the
first
sip
is
full
of
caramel
malt
flavors
which
i
like
with
a
little
tinge
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
the
hops
are
played
down
a
bit
until
towards
the
finish
as
they
should
be
in
a
winter
warmer
imo
i
think
i
favor
youngs
winter
warmer
over
this
one
which
seems
to
seems
to
be
a
little
too
fullbodied
just
a
touch
finishes
with
a
fairly
strong
chalky
bitterness
this
ale
is
not
quite
as
enjoyable
as
i
remember
it
being
but
still
a
decent
beer
for
its
style
deep
chestnut
color
with
ruby
gdges
thin
tan
head
which
remained
intact
for
a
good
amount
of
time
caramel
and
toffee
notes
along
with
spices
in
the
nose
malt
heavy
flavor
along
with
cinnamon
ginger
and
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
medium
body
low
carbonation
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
maybe
overspiced
nice
mouthfeel
to
this
one
about
the
same
as
celebration
but
not
as
big
as
anchors
our
special
ale
an
appropriate
beer
for
sippin
on
those
winter
nights
sampled
on
tap
and
served
chilled
it
pours
a
ruby
brownish
color
with
12
finger
of
head
which
is
tan
in
color
and
some
edge
lacing
on
the
glass
appears
to
be
mediumbodied
aroma
is
mainly
of
plums
and
caramel
tones
but
very
difficult
to
find
other
aromas
to
this
one
taking
the
first
sip
i
taste
sweet
plums
and
hops
w
a
nice
brown
malt
finish
some
of
the
hops
come
through
on
the
swallow
as
well
feel
is
mediumbodied
w
lots
of
stingy
carbonation
on
the
tongue
but
a
more
smooth
creamy
finish
not
a
bad
brew
but
could
be
better
this
is
my
fourth
pyramid
beer
and
im
just
about
ready
to
give
up
on
all
the
rest
not
one
of
them
has
been
good
and
the
reasons
seem
to
vary
from
beer
to
beer
simply
put
snow
cap
isnt
worth
my
time
or
your
time
or
anyone
elses
time
drinkability
is
good
not
a
bad
little
seasonal
warmer
better
then
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
from
friends
opinions
want
to
thank
merlin48
for
picking
this
one
up
for
me
blinding
see
through
amber
hue
a
hopbased
nose
with
some
baked
bread
there
as
well
rich
and
creamy
texture
up
front
a
blast
of
hops
jumps
at
the
palate
nearsyrup
sweetness
combined
with
some
malty
offerings
has
a
lingering
warming
affect
a
bit
acidic
with
some
caramel
and
cotton
candy
tastings
smooth
across
the
palate
and
a
wellrounded
mouthfeel
just
doesnt
stack
up
with
other
winter
warmers
this
beer
pours
a
rubied
brown
color
with
no
head
over
top
but
a
slight
ring
the
nose
is
deep
sweet
caramel
almost
a
cherry
aroma
with
a
dirty
hop
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
hoppy
than
the
nose
would
tell
but
still
rather
lackluster
the
flavor
is
really
not
all
that
great
some
malty
sweetness
is
there
but
its
just
not
all
that
great
the
feel
is
rather
thin
without
much
body
at
all
overall
this
is
not
really
a
great
winter
warmer
just
beer
chestnut
brown
color
with
little
or
no
head
to
speak
of
low
aromasomewhat
malty
with
a
whisper
of
spiciness
big
malt
flavor
upfront
nice
hop
bitternessthe
2
are
well
balanced
nice
medium
body
could
be
a
good
session
beer
though
im
sure
the
7
abv
would
catch
up
on
you
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
look
forward
to
each
year
i
nice
beer
but
only
one
per
session
for
me
please
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
at
the
start
and
finished
dry
with
some
crispness
medium
heavy
in
body
very
drinkable
for
a
winter
brew
as
alcohol
levels
are
low
and
the
flavor
is
mellow
the
small
head
quickly
dissapated
and
there
wasnt
too
much
lacing
the
hue
was
a
dark
amber
for
a
7
the
flavor
and
aroma
seem
to
be
awfully
heavy
on
the
alcohol
the
roasted
malts
and
golding
hops
are
there
but
the
alcohol
is
overwhelming
it
woule
be
one
thing
if
this
was
11
etc
but
it
isnt
this
one
is
mediocre
at
best
the
weakest
holiday
offering
ive
had
overall
not
a
bad
brew
one
of
the
more
palateable
winter
warmers
out
there
as
some
are
very
strong
and
rich
except
for
the
higher
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
that
i
will
have
to
look
for
in
the
future
really
a
pretty
good
beer
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
winter
warmers
id
reach
for
first
not
a
very
good
beer
ive
never
liked
any
of
pyramids
stuff
and
this
one
doesnt
do
anything
to
change
that
opinion
ill
stay
away
2004
edition

some
old

character
unfortunately
was
very
fleeting
in
nature
not
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
but
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
this
brewerys
offerings
other
comments
pretty
much
along
the
lines
of
a
typical
nw
barleywine
but
on
the
low
end
of
the
abv
scale
an
ok
winter
warmer
overall
a
tasty
holiday
beer
it
is
well
designed
and
well
executed
if
a
bit
unimaginative
as
a
good
strong
ale
i
would
enjoy
a
couple
around
a
fire
with
friends
or
with
beef
or
fruit
andor
cheesecake
i
dont
know
what
the
abv
is
but
i
suspect
that
this
would
cellar
well
for
a
year
or
so
a
very
tasty
and
warm
winter
beer
as
it
had
a
chance
to
open
the
flavors
developed
very
well
and
alcohol
presented
more
fire
this
one
poured
a
nice
redish
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
away
quickly
the
smell
is
of
spices
some
alcohol
and
some
nice
malts
the
taste
is
sweet
at
first
then
moves
to
a
caramelish
flavor
with
spices
and
alcohol
at
the
end
very
smooth
and
had
medium
carbonation
this
warmed
me
up
nicely
on
yet
antoher
crappy
western
pennsylvania
monday
night
i
much
enjoyed
this
one
pretty
good
offering
from
pyramid
but
this
year
there
are
other
seasonals
which
deserve
more
attention
still
this
is
a
nice
winter
beer
and
one
i
will
look
forward
to
having
again
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
neat
some
hops
but
a
nutty
character
with
strong
caramel
very
complex
taste
here
caramel
nuts
slight
spices
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
noticeable
but
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
good
i
liked
this
beer
but
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
finish
while
this
beer
has
alot
to
offer
i
felt
like
the
strong
finish
was
just
a
bit
too
overwhelming
if
the
finish
were
more
balanced
this
beer
would
have
earned
higher
marks
nice
tan
head
that
lasts
the
body
is
deep
brown
with
red
highlights
not
much
on
the
nose
seems
like
a
lot
of
the
winter
warmers
i
have
been
drinking
lately
have
been
a
little
heavy
on
the
hops
this
one
has
a
large
malt
body
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
rom
becoming
sweet
drinkability
very
easy
to
consume
many
of
these
in
a
session
the
7
is
just
right
although
i
would
love
to
see
what
happened
if
they
increased
it
to
about
a
9
wonder
how
the
flavors
would
change
great
beer
imo
not
bad
when
placed
up
against
the
other
seasonals
ive
reviewed
smooth
enough
to
be
enjoyed
through
an
evening
strong
enough
to
keep
the
toes
warm
on
cold
nights
drinkability
was
low
i
just
taste
burntness
i
diddnt
even
finish
my
sampler
glass
sorry
for
the
low
rating
but
im
just
not
a
fan
tasty
inexpensive
and
widely
available
this
is
my
winter
fallback
brew
a
very
solid
winter
seasonal
from
this
brewer
the
beer
poured
a
deep
clear
bronze
with
a
single
finger
of
tan
foam
atop
the
body
the
head
faded
a
bit
too
quickly
and
there
was
little
lace
the
nose
is
very
nice
with
a
solid
sense
of
caramel
below
the
quiet
hops
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
with
a
sweetness
that
is
barely
balanced
by
the
hops
good
for
a
winter
warmer
the
body
is
full
with
good
crispness
overall
a
nice
winter
beer
tastes
of
alcohol
and
burnt
toast
malts
decent
amount
of
carbination
in
here
foams
up
for
you
in
your
mouth
when
you
give
it
a
roll
over
the
tongue
nice
tasting
one
beer
is
good
happy
beering
good
beer
and
just
because
it
is
a
seasonal
doesnt
mean
it
is
only
good
in
that
season
i
must
preface
this
by
stating
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
brewery
but
i
decided
to
give
this
beer
a
shot
it
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
creme
head
a
decent
looking
beer
aroma
had
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
something
that
i
think
smells
like
some
sweet
syrup
taste
is
pretty
bland
it
has
a
little
bit
of
malty
sweetness
that
i
dont
care
that
much
more
and
mouthfeel
kind
of
thin
with
an
abv
of
7
and
not
much
in
terms
of
flavor
i
dont
see
how
this
beer
would
be
very
drinkable
imo
drinkability
this
is
an
easydrinking
beer
that
is
very
tasty
it
can
be
very
drinkable
especially
on
cold
winter
nights
not
too
shabby
deep
mahogany
thin
lace
rich
aroma
of
caramel
malts
chocolate
and
apricots
interesting
and
unexpected
flavor
is
very
reminiscnent
of
sam
adams
old
fezziwig
with
just
a
tad
less
complexity
and
spiciness
alcohol
is
just
barely
noticeable
malty
and
rich
initially
finishes
mildly
hoppy
and
slightly
tart
sharp
mouthfeel
that
could
use
less
biting
carbonation
this
doesnt
exactly
stand
out
among
winter
seasonals
so
its
not
really
worth
seeking
out
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
pours
a
cola
brown
with
a
touch
of
red
and
a
creamy
tan
head
smells
of
sweet
bready
malts
vanilla
and
cinnamon
taste
starts
with
rich
toasted
sweet
malts
light
caramel
and
vanilla
finsh
is
roasty
bitter
with
lingering
sweet
vanilla
and
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
the
best
pyramid
brew
in
my
opinion
drinkability
is
pretty
high
much
better
that
i
remembered
pyramid
snow
cap
is
by
far
the
best
that
pyramid
offers
the
apperance
is
of
mahogany
brown
with
a
darker
tannish
head
the
head
slows
down
to
a
thin
layer
as
you
drink
lacing
will
drift
as
you
drink
as
well
smell
is
of
little
malts
and
very
fruity
some
hops
come
into
play
towards
the
end
taste
is
a
little
bitter
but
not
in
a
bad
way
fruit
and
hops
blast
in
the
end
and
a
great
malty
end
feels
full
and
flavorful
in
the
mouth
on
a
cold
day
a
very
warming
beverage
ah
got
to
love
winter
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
amber
tints
with
an
off
white
head
sitting
on
top
smell
is
frutty
with
a
hint
of
skunkness
taste
is
of
sweet
syurpy
with
a
bitterness
almost
balanced
but
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
the
beer
could
use
finer
bubbles
drinkability
is
good
especially
when
you
consider
the
abv
this
poured
a
very
deep
and
dark
rubyburgundy
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
left
literally
no
lace
behind
the
aroma
is
straight
up
cherry
robotussin
yuck
it
doesnt
get
much
better
in
the
taste
too
sticky
and
syrupy
sweet
intense
fruity
bite
without
much
of
a
malt
presence
this
beer
is
unbalanced
and
not
that
drinkable
its
full
of
fruit
flavor
but
is
bitter
acidic
and
tannic
i
really
tried
but
couldnt
find
much
i
liked
about
this
beer
no
thanks
i
can
see
how
some
would
like
it
but
i
cant
see
anyone
hogging
a
full
six
pack
to
themselves
funny
that
seems
to
be
the
norm
for
my
experience
with
pyramid
drinkability
not
really
a
session
beer
not
really
even
all
that
great
due
to
the
aftertaste
but
a
good
enough
allarounder
the
6pack
will
easily
be
quaffed
in
its
entirety
and
enjoyed

the

2003
edition
east

emphasis
on

variety
wasnt
incorporated
into
the
label
this
is
a
batch
to
cellar
well
into

new
year
flavor
was
very
much
autolyzed
meaty
yeasty
brothy
flavor
some
good
malthop
flavors
but
the
autolysis
detracted
from
the

bad
bottle
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
potent
beer
for
a
seasonal
reminds
me
more
of
a
barleywine
than
a
winter
seasonal
seems
a
bit
too
heavy
for
the
style
drinkability
for
a
big
beer
this
is
an
extremely
wellmannered
easytodrink
brew
while
the
pyramid
offerings
are
not
the
most
popular
on
this
site
its
hard
to
deny
the
quality
of
this
one
well
done
i
love
the
dark
color
on
this
brew
i
poured
this
from
a
bottle
i
had
in
a
brewers
box
assortment
of
pyramid
brews
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
presented
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
disappated
carbonation
is
on
par
and
this
beer
goes
down
easy
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
nice
and
potent
i
would
not
mind
drinking
this
again
the
head
on
this
beer
is
biggish
and
tan
its
a
little
fizzy
but
dies
slowly
nonetheless
the
beer
is
dark
dark
garnetbrown
and
there
is
some
sticky
clumpy
lacing
thats
strange
theres
a
sourish
note
in
the
caramel
nose
the
front
shows
lots
of
fruit
you
know
it
kind
of
tastes
like
twizzlers
strawberry
licorice
the
middle
is
more
tart
a
little
sour
and
shows
some
deep
caramel
theres
only
a
touch
of
the
fruity
sweetness
from
the
front
finally
theres
a
quite
bitter
finish
some
bitter
cocoa
and
alcohol
aplenty
its
not
bad
it
seemed
more
aggressive
last
year
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
in
seattle
this
is
reminscent
of
a
ton
of
other
mediocre
winter
brews
that
i
have
tried
this
season
this
brew
was
a
murky
brown
colour
with
a
small
head
of
offwhite
foam
the
aromas
were
heavily
malty
with
some
spices
and
booze
in
there
as
well
the
taste
was
quite
malty
with
some
nice
hopping
going
on
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
was
just
ok
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
with
pyramids
reputation
but
this
is
surprisingly
good
and
better
than
some
other
winter
old
ales
that
ive
had
this
season
surprisingly
one
ill
probably
have
next
year
this
poured
with
very
little
head
its
color
is
deep
mahoganybrown
the
smell
was
mostly
of
alcohol
with
slight
spice
it
feels
thin
in
the
mouth
and
has
no
spice
taste
it
tastes
okay
but
certainly
isnt
something
id
want
more
than
once
this
wasnt
what
i
expected
for
a
winter
brew
2003
vintage
a
low
tan
head
formed
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
was
a
dark
nut
brown
color
with
an
orangered
hue
smelled
strongly
of
roasted
hazelnuts
and
wet
wool
this
one
had
big
flavors
of
stong
roastiness
and
toasted
nuts
with
an
assertive
hop
punch
wrapping
around
it
well
balanced
with
lingering
roastiness
and
hops
i
found
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
in
the
absence
of
imperial
porters
or
stouts
in
my
mug
it
had
a
medium
smooth
body
good
i
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
this
one
had
a
lot
of
oomph
and
was
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
interested
the
whole
way
through
good
winter
brew
this
is
a
decent
winter
brew
very
dark
brown
in
color
the
nose
is
somewhat
hoppy
there
is
little
to
no
head
but
a
good
bit
of
lacing
the
hop
profile
is
great
and
combines
well
with
the
carbonation
the
malt
is
a
little
boring
the
alcohol
is
7
and
is
hidden
quite
well
i
like
this
beer
but
it
is
a
very
typical
seasonal
ale
nothing
stands
out
very
much
a
very
nice
color
dark
red
brown
standard
xmas
beer
spice
smell
nice
taste
is
a
rush
of
alcohol
thats
not
really
masked
well
by
the
bitter
malts
and
hops
the
spices
are
notable
but
really
in
the
background
id
skip
this
and
get
the
sam
adams
winter
lager
if
i
were
you
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
no
head
to
speak
ofaroma
is
on
the
sweetish
side
with
some
light
nuttines
taste
is
also
on
the
sweeter
side
with
some
dried
fruit
flavors
the
hops
become
present
for
me
after
a
few
sips
with
the
alcohol
flavors
really
coming
thru
for
an
old
ale
for
one
its
pretty
hoppy
and
two
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
contenti
like
this
style
and
this
one
is
pretty
darn
good
thelongbeachbum
see
below
does
a
better
job
on
the
review
cheers
sir
richard

this
was
a
nice
one
snowcap
is
a
proud
tribute
to
the
potent
winter
ales
traditional
to
great
britain
deep
mahogany
in
color
and
full
of
complex
flavors
snow
cap
combines
specially
roasted
barley
malts
and
aromatic
hops
for
a
robust
winter
brew
that
is
an
ideal
choice
for
the
holiday
season
appearance
deep
ruby
almost
takes
on
a
deep
purple
tone
with
a
nice
creamy
textured
tan
head
nice
sized
at
that
with
nice
even
ringed
lacing
patterns
aroma
a
bit
dull
but
i
can
pick
out
some
toasted
malts
mild
spicing
some
finishing
hops
and
of
course
a
kick
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
here
taste
soft
sweetness
starts
to
roll
of
the
tip
of
the
tongue
then
suddenly
i
hit
a
road
block
it
finishes
with
a
strong
overbearing
onesided
flavor
a
bit
soapy
and
hoppy
but
mainly
bitterness
comes
through
not
any
flavoring
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
in
body
compared
to
most
winter
ales
this
one
lacks
body
and
the
carbonation
seems
a
bit
spritzy
drinkability
worth
a
try
because
its
winter
time
and
theres
so
many
awesome
brews
to
choose
from
i
dont
want
to
overlook
anything
but
i
could
have
gone
without
this
one
just
not
that
enjoyable
for
me
ive
had
many
better
strong
ales
than
this
one
it
poured
nice
with
an
opaque
darkness
and
good
sized
bubbling
head
but
the
actually
beer
was
not
the
best
it
was
balanced
but
the
flavors
seemed
a
little
dull
not
much
depth
and
alcohol
was
a
little
too
strong
the
spices
seemed
to
be
missing
isnt
this
a
winter
beer
improved
as
it
warmed
and
the
flavors
melded
better
together
but
all
in
all
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
a
nice
winter
offering
a
welcome
addition
to
the
shelves
of
my
local
beer
store
pours
a
deep
mohogany
hue
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
smells
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
spice
tastes
very
nice
smooth
maltiness
with
a
slight
spiciness
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
a
very
solid
holiday
brew
update
for
2004
they
hopped
this
baby
up
with
some
stiff
pine
resin
it
smells
and
tastes
a
whole
lot
hoppier
the
mouthfeel
though
is
still
too
light
for
the
big
flavors
theyre
packing
into
this
beer
the
taste
that
reminds
me
of
the
holidaze
i
love
it
when
this
comes
out
each
year
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
though
but
this
years
offering
is
not
as
hoppy
as
other
years
just
a
wonderful
winter
ale
for
sipping
by
the
fire
watching
tv
i
find
i
can
only
drink
one
or
two
though
starts
to
taste
pugnant
after
that
but
that
first
sip
and
others
are
really

this

to

tasting
an
not

i
was
pretty
disappointed
i
may
try
it
again
in

since
my

was
nothing

a

of
other
peoples

a
deep
mahogany
body
with
reddish
highlights
is
capped
by
a
short
but
creamy
lighttan
head
its
retention
is
limited
and
it
drops
shortly
to
a
thin
collar
and
leaves
only
minimal
spotty
lacing
the
nose
is
not
very
welcoming
but
not
exactly
offputting
it
clearly
displays
some
higher
alcohols
with
notes
of
acetonesolvent
and
acetaldehyde
i
can
only
believe
that
the
fermentation
was
hot
and
fast
beyond
that
theres
not
much
some
mild
maltiness
light
woodyearthy
character
and
maybe
fading
spices
fortunately
a
third
strike
is
avoided
as
the
higher
alcohols
are
somewhat
masked
in
a
flavor
thats
malty
and
deeply
toasted
with
a
light
spiciness
and
a
firm
resiny
hop
flavor
the
bitterness
is
well
entrenched
and
also
helps
to
cover
up
its
heat
surprisingly
it
finishes
quite
dry
but
with
a
spot
of
sweet
caramelized
malt
some
hop
bitterness
lingers
but
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
also
starts
to
build
at
the
back
of
the
throat
disappointing
i
hope
i
didnt
wait
too
long
to
try
this
however
it
has
a
good
reputation
and
ill
give
it
another
shot
next
year
overall
a
good

seems
like
it
could
use

if
this
is
what
winter
seasonal

are
coming
to
i
like
it
this

a

the
normal

brews
i
am
used
to
trying
this
brew
has
a
very
respectable

that
lingers

is
quite
light
the

has
some

again
very

the

turns

of
sweet

update
the
above
was
written
when
the
principal
hops
in
snowcap
was
fuggles
the
last
few
years
the
beer
has
made
it
back
to
houston
but
now
pyramid
is
now
using
east
kent
golding
less
earthy
a
little
more
piney
it
just
aint
the
same
bring
back
the
beer
i
remember
o
definitely
an
american
version
of
the
winter
warmer
with
the
piney
hops
but
excellent
malt
presence
and
a
balanced
rewarding
beer
solid
overall
ive
got
5
more
of
these
and
im
not
sorry
overall
this
was
a
nicely
spiced
winter
warmer
the
flavoring
is
savory
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
and
the
spice
is
certainly
there
but
the
wonderfully
decreased
pint
night
special
pricing
also
helped
quite
a
bit
the
beer
went
well
with
our
jalapeño
burger
and
chicken
caesar
wrap
respectively
helping
to
quell
any
spice
or
savoriness
from
the
meal
really
rather
standard
but
flavorful
aromatic
and
hearty
enough
for
season
first
offering
from
boulevard
that
i
havent
liked
way
to
hoppy
of
a
winter
warmer
for
my
tastes
o
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
a
little
of
the
heavily
spiced
winter
warmers
it
is
nothing
to
trade
a
kidney
for
but
i
would
be
happy
to
have
it
each
winter
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
lot
of
suspended
minuscule
sediment
within
the
body
gives
it
a
murky
complexion
a
half
inch
of
tightly
knit
beige
head
is
present
i
smell
light
malt
and
perhaps
hazlenut
the
flavor
is
more
of
a
nutty
fare
with
gentle
citrus
dry
hopping
the
body
is
fairly
smooth
and
dry
o
nice
winter
beer
that
has
some
warming
ability
good
holiday
flavors
very
drinkable
kind
of
bitter
for
a
winter
warmer
much
too
bitter
for
it
to
be
considered
a
christmas
ale
this
beer
has
a
nice
taste
which
consists
of
a
definite
happiness
it
is
altogether
approachable
and
drinkable

did
not
taste
like
a
high
abv
beer
wasnt
too
bitter
was
interesting
easy
to
drink
for
what
i
was
expecting
would
definitely
try
again
pour

hops
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
candy
sugar
plum
and
hops
can
definitely
tell
the
hops
are
chinook
with
the
bit
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
and
coats
the
mouth
overall
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
made
better
with
the
addition
of
fresh
hops
a
wintertime
staple
i
was
happy
to
try
this
winter
seasonal
since
id
never
had
it
before
and
wanted
to
compare
it
to
a
couple
of
my
other
favorites
in
this
style
it
held
up
fairly
well
and
id
buy
it
again
good
mix
of
traditional
holiday
flavors
and
a
bit
higher
alcohol
content
for
when
youre
staying
home
and
out
of
the
snow
overall
a
good
beer
experience
the
flavor
really
changes
with
the
temperature
in
my
opinion
a
bit
smoother
at
lower
temps
with
higher
temps
you
get
more
of
the
hopalcohol
bite
not
necessarily
a
negative
thing
pours
a
hazy
amber
bronze
in
color
with
a
good
1finger
light
beige
foamy
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layering
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
but
wasnt
heavy
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
spices
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
some
citrus
over
tones
and
a
strong
pepper
spice
finish
slightly
bitter
finish
as
well
o
taste
is
not
quite
what
i
had
hope
for
after
the
nose
but
it
smells
really
good
o
a
slightly
richer
and
sweeter
beer
but
nothing
that
really
reminds
me
of
the
holiday
season
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
although
it
wasnt
that
sweet
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
offering
from
boulevard
my
only
suggestion
is
that
they
turn
down
the
hops
just
a
bit
there
are
great
moments
when
this
beer
evens
out
and
is
nearly
perfect
but
there
are
also
many
occasions
when
the
hops
dominate
the
taste
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
and
all
beer
lovers
definitely
a
brew
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
next
winter
made
w
chinook
hops
nutcracker
is
a
seasonal
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
the
chinook
hop
was
developed
as
recently
as
1985
it
has
a
spicy
flavordefinitely
tasting
of
grapefruit
and
pine
about
as
close
as
ill
ever
get
to
a
spruce
beer
o
one
of
the
likable
winter
warmers
looking
forward
to
next
years
stylistically
it
throws
me
its
like
a
freshhopdubbel
which
ive
never
heard
of
but
i
like
the
shit
out
of
it
overall
pretty
masterful
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
year
very
fine
holiday
offering
from
boulevard
this
wet
hop
chinook
ale
pours
a
great
dark
hazy
redbrown
hue
with
a
creamy
stubborn
head
smell
is
of
hop
oil
burnt
brown
sugar
and
a
little
booze
on
the
end
taste
is
easy
to
enjoy
hoppy
and
creamy
easy
on
the
palate
and
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
even
more
as
it
warmed
i
would
definitely
purchase
this
one
again
very
good
seek
it
out
overall
really
well
done
hoppy
example
of
a
winter
warmer
insanely
easy
to
drink
and
dangerous
at
7
8
overall
its
fine
but
id
politely
pass
it
up
on
a
second
occasion
o
an
interesting
and
distinct
winter
ale
not
challenging
although
it
took
me
a
little
while
to
warm
up
to
it
overall
probably
my
favorite
winter
warmer
because
its
loaded
with
hops
overall
love
it
update
the
2013
release
is
awesome
blvd
has
tweaked
this
beer
over
the
years
and
it
seems
to
get
better
every
year
originally
this
beer
was
5
8
abv
now
its
up
to
7
8
and
better
than
ever
very
interesting
winter
warmer
to
say
the
least
total
contrast
in
styles
and
i
wound
not
qualify
this
as
a
winter
warmer
simply
cause
of
the
hop
presence
doesnt
make
this
a
bad
beer
but
imho
has
too
much
going
on
that
contrast
and
not
accentuate
looks
great
smells
even
better
with
the
usual
spices
of
the
season
shining
through
taste
is
unique
with
a
winter
warmer
with
a
hop
backing
that
totally
doesnt
work
together
the
way
i
imagined
very
thin
mouthfeel
again
not
expected
then
again
when
you
throw
all
logic
out
the
window
and
dont
judge
by
style
its
a
damn
fine
beer
go
figure
i
am
gonna
buy
another
sixer
and
let
them
rest
for
a
while
to
let
the
hops
mellow
than
revisit
i
love
the
spicey
bite
that
follows
the
smooth
caramel
a
perfect
winter
warmer
starts
rather
caramel
like
with
hints
sorghum
syrup
then
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
kick
in
i
wonder
if
this
beer
is
the
closet
thing
we
produce
that
is
closest
to
a
true
burton
ale
someone
needs
to
ask
the
zythophyle
i
love
this
beer
by
an
open
fire
o
a
great
holiday
warmer
that
really
packs
a
flavorful
punch
the
alcohol
is
present
but
does
kill
the
palate
cant
wait
to
go
back
to
oklahoma
were
i
can
drink
this
yearly
cheers
o
nicely
hopped
for
a
winter
warmer
good
depth

the

to

list

not

d
interesting
beer
and
glad
to
try
it
but
not

for
me
its

high

goes

decent
representation
of

to
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
although
ive
moved
away
from
them
if
youre
looking
for
a
decent
winter
warmer
this
is
one
to
go
with
medium
bodied
and
kind
of
harshly
firm
a
relatively
good
beer
but
disappointing
because
it
seems
like
it
could
be
so
much
better

this
one
kept
the

to

could
drink
a
few
around

the

a

choice
any

night
of

slightly
oxidized
medium
body
that
is
very
hop
forward
for
the
style
with
lots
of
dry
earthy
pine
notes
and
subtle
hints
of
citrus
there
is
a
very
prominent
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
thick
syrupy
consistency
slight
peppery
spice
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
mostly
tart
dark
cherry
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
which
is
decently
balanced
with
perhaps
too
strong
of
a
hop
character
slightly
dry
finish
d
this
was
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
at
least
to
me
it
seemed
pretty
unique
i
dont
know
i
would
get
it
again
but
it
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
are
looking
for
a
different
kind
of
holiday
cheer
notes
more
hops
than
you
would
expect
pretty
good
mix
a
little
too
hoppy
for
me
in
that
i
was
expecting
less
hops
and
more
caramelnutty
malt
and
spice
d
once
again
decent
drinkability
per
style
with
a
festive
blend
of
spices
gives
this
a
holiday
feel
but
a
couple
is
plenty
at
one
sitting
pours
a
cloudy
orangish
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
roasted
malts
and
spicy
hops
taste
is
caramel
malt
up
front
with
a
woody
earthy
yet
also
citrusy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
smooth
average
carbonation
levels
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
that
i
plan
on
buying
next
year
d
not
bad
definitely
a
consideration
for
a
winter
session
but
maybe
falls
a
little
short
here
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
would
probably
reach
for
something
a
little
more
roasty
in
the
winter
nice
beer
from
a
brewery
that
is
really
growing
on
me
d
hops
a
very
prominent
not
very
complex
easily
drinkable
especially
with
hearty
winter
foods
overall
i
like
this
better
than
the
statewide
ipa
im
an
all
year
winter
warmer
drinker
like
my
beers
a
bit
bigger
if
you
want
to
try
boulevard
try
this
in
general
winter
warmers
are
not
my
style
of
beer
although
i
found
nutcraker
ale
to
be
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
it
is
the
complete
opposite
of
most
winter
warmers
you
see
like
the
style
link
says
on
this
site
many
beers
with
a
bunch
of
spices
like
a
wassail
may
say
winter
warmer
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
ever
tried
from
boulevard
but
it
makes
me
want
to
try
more
thanks
again
blueokie
quite
drinkable
despite
touch
of
noticeable
alcohol
which
enhances
rather
than
detracts
in
this
case
a
hoppy
winter
wamer
with
a
nice
minty
seasonable
touch
to
it
d
simple
but
drinkable
hop
taste
is
a
bit
too
strong
but
the
beer
went
down
smooth
and
strong
with
a
warm
stew
overall
this
beer
seems
more
like
an
aipa
than
a
winter
warmer
i
like
this
better
than
the
single
wide
ipa
too
has
really
good
hop
flavors
and
remains
very
drinkable
despite
high
abv
this
is
a
neat
beer
thats
worth
trying
at
least
once
a
year
tanks
to
wagenvolks
for
the
extra
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
decent
eggshell
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
pine
hops
and
mild
spice
the
taste
is
an
interesting
blend
of
sweet
malts
and
citrus
and
pine
hops
with
a
mild
amount
of
cinnamon
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
winter
warmer
but
not
likely
one
id
bother
with
again
overall
a
pretty
neutral
event
certainly
a
quality
brew
just
no
real
flavor
to
grab
on
to
d
body
and
flavor
combine
for
an
excellent
drinkability
delicious
beer
all
the
way
around
its
alright
but
not
some
of
my
fav
characteristics
blended
together
poured
with
a
nice
off
white
to
light
tan
head
and
some
lace
color
is
an
attractive
medium
amber
with
some
copper
highlights
aroma
is
malty
molasses
a
little
toffee
and
bit
of
vanillacaramel
flavors
about
the
same
good
body
and
carbonation
kind
of
a
sweet
finish
a
hint
of
alcohol
at
the
end
of
the
finish
not
bad
medium
body
carbonation
seems
a
bit
high
alcohol
is
well
hidden
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
is
pretty
nice
d
very
rich
and
full
bodied
have
a
feeling
that
these
would
start
to
be
on
the
heavy
side
after
a
while
definitely
not
a
sipper
but
far
from
a
session
beer
for
me
too
alcohol
is
pretty
normal
at
5
9
so
my
mind
says
i
could
probably
get
away
with
having
a
few
without
regretting
it
but
my
palate
says
this
is
stronger
not
in
a
bad
way
just
doesnt
feel
like
i
could
have
too
many
of
these
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
and
id
say
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
full
of
flavor
nice
hop
flavor
balance
with
the
malt
great
winter
seasonal
the
body
is
a
light
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
it
has
a
nice
color
the
head
was
thick
and
frothy
with
a
great
lace
that
just
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
citrus
and
spice
i
am
not
sure
if
that
comes
from
orange
peel
or
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
but
not
overwhelming
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
spicy
it
was
a
little
more
balanced
on
tap
than
it
was
in
the
bottle
i
am
going
with
the
sample
i
had
tap
or
it
would
have
had
a
lower
rating
overall
not
bad
prickly
a
bit
overcarbonated
average
ale
mouth
i
could
drink
quite
a
lot
of
this
particular
seasonal
poured
into
a
pint
glass
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
foamy
head
good
lacing
smells
of
fresh
hops
but
the
taste
isnt
really
all
that
great
there
is
a
slight
hop
bite
up
front
but
there
is
a
weird
taste
after
that
that
leads
to
a
unflattery
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
however
id
rather
have
a
little
more
warmth
from
alcohol
for
this
style
tropical
fruit
and
holiday
spices
on
the
front
of
the
palate
with
pineapple
pear
and
peach
a
venerable
fruit
cocktail
hops
come
in
with
authority
towards
the
finish
adding
a
spicy
bitterness
that
balances
nicely
with
toasted
caramel
and
pale
malts
body
is
slightly
overcarbonated
and
although
the
medium
thickness
fits
the
style
well
nutcracker
dries
out
a
bit
too
much
on
the
end
still
this
is
a
very
tasty
very
hoppy
holiday
ale
i
probably
wouldnt
have
picked
it
up
had
it
not
been
on
sale
at
specs
this
week
7
99
a
sixer
but
even
at
full
price
i
would
have
been
glad
i
did
nice
job
boulevard
at
6
49
a
sixer
i
could
not
pass
this
up
especially
given
the
brewery
nice
dark
orange
color
decent
white
head
suspended
yeast
particles
throughout
smells
like
hops
at
first
almost
minty
but
maybe
im
imagining
things
then
its
a
more
caramel
smell
nice
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
and
is
a
little
different
than
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
this
seems
like
a
well
hopped
pale
ale
with
a
nice
caramel
maltiness
i
wonder
if
they
used
spices
good
stuff
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
brown

less
than
a

up

more
prominent
on

back
end
not
much

but
a
pretty

a

more

when
warm
why
are
they
chilling
the
glasses
very
drinkable
need
a
bit
of
warming
before
serving
a
nice
winter
warmer
d
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
a
winter
warmer
not
as
sweet
or
malty
as
i
expected
but
i
found
it
to
be
an
enjoyable
change
of
pace
poured
a
hazy
dark
redorange
to
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
with
good
clingy
lacing
smell
is
malty
sweet
with
some
vanillamolasses
and
spicy
hop
cinamon
ginger
in
the
background
i
like
the
taste
better
than
most
spiced
winter
warmers
it
has
a
nice
balanced
sweet
malty
molasses
caramel
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
bitter
citrusy
hops
in
the
finish
the
cinamon
ginger
nutmeg
orange
come
out
at
the
end
i
am
going
to
stop
trying
to
make
myself
like
spiced
beer
its
not
happening
for
me
anyway
as
this
style
goes
i
think
this
is
most
drinkable
one
i
have
come
across
not
bad
d
high
id
have
another
and
buy
another
sixer
good
holiday
beer
that
avoids
being
overly
spicy
and
achieves
uniqueness
with
wethopping
d
a
nicely
done
beer
unfortunately
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
all
that
special
more
of
a
regular
apa
than
a
traditional
winter
warmer
boulevard
has
done
better
work
d
boulevards
seasonal
beers
continue
to
shine
for
me
this
is
a
very
season
appropriate
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
very
christmasy
for
any
unrefined
characteristics
it
may
have
the
beer
endears
itself
well
to
me
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
little
thinbodiedthis
beers
only
flaw
good
hoppy
bitter
balanced
warmer
i
like
my
winter
beers
with
a
little
more
hops
than
most
have
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
def
worth
a
try
full
flavored
with
plenty
of
interesting
complexity
this
warmer
is
a
winner
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
think
it
would
be
better
as
an
all
year
around
beer
though
not
much
of
a
winter
warmer
reminds
me
more
of
a
pale
ale
aromas
of
hops
and
fruity
sweatness
after
the
pour
taste
of
sweat
malt
and
fruit
well
balanced
with
a
fresh
hops
on
the
finish
and
slighty
bitter
bite
i
bought
a
sixer
doubt
i
will
buy
anymore
the
piney
hops
really
capture
the
essence
of
christmas
not
your
typical
maltheavy
winter
warmer
here
the
overload
of
carbonation
is
something
new
to
this
years
batch
and
detracts
from
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
otherwise
this
is
nice
beer
that
is
more
like
a
pale
ale
or
hoppy
amber
than
it
is
a
winter
warmer
great
drinkability
the
fruity
essence
really
shows
as
it
warms
nothing
like
the
spiced
monsters
were
used
to
appearance
is
a
hazy
red
clouds
of
pearlish
brown
slide
throughout
smell
is
a
little
bit
tinny
but
just
a
touch
mostly
it
smells
a
little
like
toffee
but
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
a
winter
warmer
its
not
straight
ahead
spicy
on
smell
or
taste
which
gives
it
sort
of
a
dual
personality
the
first
2
i
had
from
the
sixer
tasted
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
but
the
last
few
have
been
a
little
bit
more
spicy
tasting
mouth
feel
is
surprisingly
full
and
i
think
thats
the
best
part
of
the
beer
despite
the
heavy
feel
its
fairly
drinkable
but
it
should
be
noted
that
it
seems
like
type
of
beer
thats
probably
going
to
dehydrate
you
2009
version
is
way
different
form
prior
years
much
more
hoppy
more
like
an
ipapa
this
year
than
the
malty
sweetness
than
im
used
too
much
more
carbonation
than
prior
years
can
you
tell
yet
that
i
like
the
nutcracker
of
the
past
this
years
batch
is
good
but
not
what
im
used
too
almost
sn
celebration
copy
miss
the
old
nutcracker
d
pretty
good
who
says
you
cant
drink
a
winter
warmer
on
an
august
florida
evening
d
im
new
to
the
style
but
i
think
a
few
of
these
would
go
down
easy
on
a
cold
night
m
d
sparkling
assertive
carbonation
without
beiing
stinging
robust
flavour
without
a
big
alcohol
booziness
that
all
translates
to
some
good
minus
the
negative
points
which
makes
for
a
pretty
decent
beer
experience
to
me
this
one
was
pretty
good
and
would
be
nice
to
grab
a
case
around
the
holiday
season
if
this
was
local
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
caramel
light
citrus
hops
and
cardboard
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
a
pretty
typical
english
style
ale
i
would
drink
this
again
but
its
nothing
special
taste
is
lighter
in
body
than
expected
form
the
nose
and
the
spice
is
rather
prominent
on
the
finish
decent
carbonation
and
with
more
bitternesschalkiness
on
the
close
than
anticipated
no
notable
alcohol
on
the
nose
or
tongue
however
a
decent
winter
brew
yet
not
overwhelming
but
worth
a
try
drinkability
the
combination
of
attributes
above
make
this
a
very
good
beer
that
goes
down
really
easy
i
already
had
2
and
could
easily
have
one
more
d
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
much
more
than
i
expected
that
i
would
the
spice
profile
doesnt
favor
one
flavor
or
another
d
pretty
good
grows
on
me
after
some
initial
doubt
good
taste
and
very
appealing
aroma
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
next
winter
would
seek
it
out
i
was
expecting
this
one
to
be
a
bit
heavier
but
nonethe
less
its
a
pretty
available
beer
thats
got
a
lot
goin
for
it
i
could
easily
sit
and
sip
these
all
night
d
very
drinkable
although
i
only
drank
a
couple
it
seemed
to
really
do
it
for
me
for
having
such
a
low
abv
i
would
definitely
purchase
this
again
forgot
id
reviewed
this
one
already
like
it
a
bit
better
this
go
around
around
bumping
up
the
drinkability
from
3
5
4
0
and
the
appearance
from
3
0
to
3
5
just
because
i
feel
it
warrants
a
higher
score
so
from
3
3
to
3
45
overall
seems
more
spicy
than
my
previous
take
a
gentle
little
winter
toaster
and
agreeable
could
drink
a
few
of
these
not
a
bad
brew
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
red
copper
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
smell
is
like
caramel
and
spices
taste
is
mostly
biscuitlike
malts
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
spice
medium
bodied
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
i
could
put
away
four
or
five
of
these
on
a
cold
winter
night
another
quality
beer
from
boulevard
d
full
flavor
and
good
body
not
too
high
alcohol
level
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
interesting
and
unique
flavor
for
a
winter
warmer
quite
enjoyable
one
of
those
beers
where
the
taste
matches
the
nose
well
piney
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
with
toasty
sweet
malts
a
bit
thin
bodied
and
falls
on
the
lighter
side
of
christmas
ales
but
maintains
plenty
of
flavor
and
has
a
creamy
feel
to
it
actually
is
pretty
refreshing
when
thirsty
would
easily
be
able
to
tear
up
a
sixer
of
this
in
an
evening
a
throwdown
holiday
ale
if
you
will
well
done
another
good
beer
from
the
folks
in
kc
a
decent
winter
warmer
with
a
hint
of
hop
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
buy
again
for
the
winter
months
as
with
all
the
beers
in
my
mixasix
i
picked
it
up
out
of
curiosity
worth
trying
once
good
but
not
great
i
may
be
inclined
to
try
this
on
tap
but
im
not
sure
that
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
the
stuff
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
sure
but
somehow
not
what
i
expected
brewing
flaws
are
apparent
in
this
one
i
wont
be
trying
it
again
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
just
not
what
i
would
think
of
as
a
holiday
winter
warmer
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
question
the
classification
of
this
as
a
winter
warmer
it
sure
seemed
a
heckuva
lot
closer
to
being
something
like
an
octoberfest
orangeredbrown
a
bit
of
spicy
clove
and
pepper
offset
with
a
sticky
malty
sweetness
not
a
bad
beer
but
what
exactly
were
they
going
for
here
purchased
south
bay
drugs
imperial
beach
ca
its
not
bad
but
i
was
expecting
better
maybe
ive
been
blessed
with
much
better
winter
seasonals
this
year
so
they
outshine
this
one
not
bad
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
category
is
fairly
wide
open
and
this
resides
in
the
lighter
more
drinkable
realm
i
really
enjoy
the
interplay
of
the
doughy
sweet
gingerbready
malt
and
the
more
fragrant
orangepeel
hopping
i
could
go
for
a
bit
more
gumption
and
girth
but
this
rounds
out
as
a
solid
winterthemed
sessioner
dits
an
ok
beer
not
great
and
its
malt
presence
seemed
a
bit
lacking
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
d
very
drinkable
beer
not
too
hoppy
pulled
a
bottle
out
of
a
variety
case
poured
a
dark
ruby
red
with
an
offwhite
head
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
version
of
sam
smiths
winter
welcome
on
a
basic
malt
level
this
is
both
good
and
bad
while
the
flavoris
very
smooth
the
caramel
malts
arent
terribly
rich
this
beer
relies
more
on
the
pleasant
mix
of
citrus
hops
flavors
that
make
this
similar
to
rogues
santas
reserve
or
a
hoppy
red
ale
worth
a
try
for
nonspiced
winter
warmer
overall
this
is
a
really
great
winter
beer
and
easy
to
drink
id
recommend
this
for
a
nice
session
beer
d
a
good
winter
warmereasy
to
drink
with
still
a
good
amount
of
taste
notes
from
12707
d
a
nice
beer
but
the
warming
quality
isnt
where
i
thought
it
would
be
definitely
a
nice
place
to
start
the
evening
and
i
think
i
could
get
warm
after
putting
a
few
of
these
away
this
beer
was
tremendous
the
deep
amber
color
with
a
minimal
head
was
very
pleasing
the
smell
was
of
nuts
maybe
spice
and
maybe
a
little
fruity
nothing
too
powerful
the
taste
was
smooth
with
a
very
complex
character
first
was
a
slight
nutty
taste
then
spices
such
as
cinnamon
maybe
nutmeg
the
alcohol
was
there
but
was
very
subtle
mouthfeel
was
good
but
perhaps
a
little
thin
overall
and
excellent
brew
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
something
to
bring
to
a
christmas
party
that
will
be
a
hit
with
the
non
beer
geeks
overall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
any
beer
enthusiast
looking
for
a
good
winter
beer
that
and
i
love
the
fact
that
it
is
brewed
less
then
2
hours
from
my
hometown
and
i
regularly
make
trips
to
kansas
city
for
football
baseball
and
concerts
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
i
could
see
myself
making
a
sixpack
last
all
winter
though
this
wouldnt
be
my
choice
to
session
or
anything
id
drink
this
again
i
would
say
it
has
good
drinkablity
to
it
d
i
like
this
more
than
in
years
past
maybe
i
just
didnt
appreciate
it
before
others
have
said
its
a
bit
different
than
before
dont
care
i
like
it
this
year
cant
have
more
than
a
couple
though
the
lingering
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
hard
to
stop
at
one
hard
to
keep
going
after
two
ill
be
buying
another
sixer
of
this
one
this
year
i
would
enjoy
drinking
up
to
three
bottles
of
this
delicious
beer
but
any
more
would
be
a
sugar
overload
overall
lighter
then
i
expected
but
still
ahead
of
the
curve
i
think
if
you
are
a
fan
of
octoberfest
esque
beers
you
might
enjoy
this
one
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
boulevard
smokestack
goblet
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
filtered
english
barleywine
then
a
winter
warmer
it
pours
a
clear
orangey
amber
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
that
faded
away
into
just
a
slight
rim
around
the
glass
leaving
the
edges
as
clean
as
they
were
before
i
poured
the
beer
in
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
hoppy
with
orange
and
grapefruit
coming
through
followed
by
cinnamon
and
what
reminds
me
of
roasted
barley
the
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
the
aroma
but
the
malt
plays
a
much
larger
role
in
the
all
around
finish
of
the
beer
a
rich
maltiness
overshadows
the
hops
so
prevalent
in
the
nose
prunes
dates
and
other
dark
fruits
pop
up
in
the
flavor
profile
pushing
the
grapefruit
to
play
second
fiddle
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
for
a
winter
warmer
but
doesnt
really
take
away
from
the
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
seasonals
that
boulevard
puts
out
and
is
something
that
i
always
look
forward
to
each
christmas
time
this
pours
a
dirty
brown
with
some
reddish
copper
highlightsthe
head
is
tan
and
tall
the
nose
smells
of
lightly
roasted
malts
and
spicemaybe
some
cinnamon
and
hints
if
citrus
this
is
a
nutty
warmer
and
quite
complex
as
well
this
has
a
spicytangy
bite
mid
way
that
is
quite
enjoyable
and
last
through
the
finish
roasted
almonds
and
cashews
mix
with
orange
rind
and
subtle
caramel
malting
to
create
a
most
flavorful
and
unique
offering
medium
bodied
and
prickly
carbonation
that
is
not
overbearing
keeps
drinkability
above
average
a
good
winter
warmer
a
mixture
of
an
american
pale
ale
hop
profile
and
a
english
strong
bitter
malt
character
could
be
ever
so
slightly
dryer
in
my
opinion
i
could
drink
all
the
time
in
the
winter
season
drinkability
is
high
its
tasty
and
a
nice
holiday
addition
glad
i
bought
a
6
pack
i
dont
usually
because
i
want
to
revisit
this
a
couple
times
this
season
winter
warmer
seems
to
pick
up
a
lot
of
variations
this
one
is
good
but
id
rather
see
the
malt
featured
and
maybe
more
alcohol
this
has
a
lot
of
hops
for
this
style
amber
color
with
orange
highlights
slightly
hazy
and
a
nice
off
white
head
lacing
is
good
slightly
piney
aroma
and
some
sweet
malts
a
citrus
fruit
flavor
in
here
plenty
of
orange
and
grapefruit
nice
use
of
hops
piney
some
spiciness
and
some
sweet
caramel
flavors
very
nicely
balanced
between
the
sweet
and
bitter
creamy
mouthfeel
with
average
carbonation
a
very
nice
beer
and
probably
one
of
my
favorite
nonsmokestack
boulevard
beers
sweeter
and
milder
than
expected
quite
drinkable
and
worth
trying
for
sure
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
colour
big
white
head
with
ok
retention
and
ok
lace
smell
is
very
fruity
and
bready
flavour
starts
hop
foward
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
then
gets
some
malt
sweetness
in
the
middle
finishes
with
a
little
yeasty
fruitiness
and
a
nice
bitterness
body
is
quite
full
with
a
lower
carbonation
level
a
nice
beer
it
comes
across
to
me
a
bit
like
a
hopped
up
bobs
47
not
a
favorite
of
mine
i
tried
this
on
two
different
days
to
see
if
my
tastebuds
were
off
tasted
the
same
i
just
did
not
like
the
hop
and
spice
combination
pours
out
a
deep
russet
amber
color
no
head
a
few
oily
bubbles
at
first
but
just
a
slick
surface
after
that
smells
strongly
of
spice
and
sweet
malts
tastes
the
same
but
more
complexity
comes
out
as
it
warms
a
little
over
carbonated
for
my
tastes
overall
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
will
finish
off
this
5
pack
today
gotta
love
saturdays
devery
winter
from
this
point
on
and
i
may
backstock
some
the
drinkability
is
better
then
most
for
the
style
prosit
mk
dark
cloudy
brown
with
a
decent
tan
head
nice
duration
with
some
lacing
the
aromas
are
nice
but
subtle
roasted
chocolate
and
some
coffee
fine
toffeelike
taste
that
with
the
chocolate
malt
make
this
a
fairly
fullbodied
warmer
with
a
slight
hint
of
mint
creamy
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
this
is
rather
good
a
fine
warmer
and
solid
offering
from
boulevard
pours
a
rich
cloudy
muddy
brown
color
with
a
beige
lasting
head
sweet
caramel
and
chocolatey
toffee
malt
with
a
big
hit
of
piney
hops
medium
to
light
bodied
with
slightly
too
much
carbonation
that
made
it
fizzy
and
foamy
in
the
mouth
hoppy
and
piney
fresh
taste
along
with
rich
toasty
malt
good
overall
d
easy
christmas
beer
to
drink
finally
finishing
off
some
of
the
last
of
my
winter
brews
this
highly
carbonated
reddishbrown
brew
is
topped
off
by
a
fully
realized
twofinger
tan
head
that
peeps
over
the
rim
threatening
to
overflow
and
finally
settling
in
its
own
good
time
sweet
malts
hit
the
nose
and
are
checked
quickly
by
the
hop
and
spice
aromas
tastes
a
bit
of
spice
and
pine
up
front
with
an
earthy
tone
toward
the
end
hops
are
a
bit
understated
compared
to
a
malt
essence
that
creeps
around
the
edges
of
the
palate
a
slight
hint
of
yeast
peeks
through
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
it
goes
down
smooth
not
as
spicy
as
some
winter
warmers
ive
had
lately
but
damn
good
drinking
nonetheless
would
actually
be
a
good
yearround
beer
to
be
enjoyed
almost
anytime
d
incredibly
drinkable
esspecially
in
the
cold
weather
should
be
served
around
45
to
55
degrees
overall
a
nice
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
much
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
this
beer
pours
a
murky
muddy
brown
color
it
looks
like
marsh
water
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
fluffy
and
light
tan
in
color
it
recedes
slowly
into
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
nuts
and
citrus
hops
it
smells
like
a
cross
between
a
nutty
brown
ale
and
a
centennial
ipa
the
taste
is
a
little
maltier
than
the
aroma
but
the
hops
show
themselves
in
a
lasting
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
carbonation
seems
to
get
it
the
way
of
the
flavor
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
2007
edition
this
is
much
better
than
i
remembered
nice
job
boulevard
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
the
winter
months
and
i
have
noticed
it
seems
to
be
more
enjoyable
with
friends
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
abv
let
this
warm
up
a
bit
great
to
session
on
note
they
also
make
an
even
better
dry
hopped
version
of
this
available
only
at
the
brewery
on
tours
or
at
special
tastings
got
this
beer
out
of
a
sampler
pack
overall
this
beer
was
more
hoppy
than
most
winter
warmers
i
have
had
but
it
poured
an
amber
color
and
was
very
enjoyable
i
just
found
these
beers
available
in
this
area
so
i
hope
to
get
more
in
the
near
future
2012
this
always
seems
to
be
on
draft
at
northwoods
lodge
in
springfield
usually
hits
the
spot
and
is
relatively
fresh
a
good
beer
for
winter
drinking
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
deep
ruby
color
it
had
a
2
finger
head
that
settled
into
a
broken
film
no
carb
and
light
lacing
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
fruity
with
a
touch
of
spice
the
taste
was
pretty
good
it
was
malty
with
a
nice
spice
undertone
that
kept
it
interesting
i
find
most
winter
warmers
to
be
dominated
by
alcohol
but
its
really
not
present
in
this
one
which
makes
it
enjoyable
overall
its
a
good
ww
and
i
could
see
me
having
another
if
i
could
borrow
from
a
friend
or
get
as
part
or
a
sampler
again
mild
recommend
rare
buy
or
steal
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
two
finger
dark
white
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbels
definitely
leaves
its
mark
with
a
very
nice
webbing
left
behind
smell
is
very
balanced
between
a
light
caramel
malt
with
a
fresh
citrus
zest
almost
esb
like
some
floral
aromas
emerge
as
well
in
the
nose
taste
is
light
toffee
sweet
hazelnut
and
spicey
nut
subtle
cinnamon
flavors
throughout
that
lead
to
a
similar
aftertaste
medium
body
with
a
full
carbonation
very
good
fit
in
the
holiday
seasonal
beer
category
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
thanks
tim
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
ingredients
with
the
malts
taking
the
lead
thus
making
it
very
well
fitted
into
the
style
another
very
solid
offering
from
in
my
opinion
an
underrated
brewery
would
certainly
welcome
another
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
a
massive
tan
head
with
terrific
retention
sheets
of
lacing
line
the
wide
mouth
glass
a
beautiful
beer
the
nose
is
slightly
candy
sweet
with
hints
of
floral
and
herbal
hops
at
the
fore
the
spicy
notes
really
bring
the
holidays
to
mind
this
probably
how
a
winter
warmer
is
supposed
to
smell
the
palate
is
wonderfully
complex
a
barrage
of
hops
upfront
but
quickly
balanced
out
by
a
nice
subtle
sweet
malt
character
that
lends
a
great
warm
caramel
and
nut
aspect
to
the
beer
this
beer
is
masterfully
balanced
not
a
hop
bomb
or
sweet
to
the
point
of
cloying
the
flavors
play
off
of
each
other
in
a
very
nice
way
leaving
a
complex
yet
accessible
flavor
profile
the
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
especially
as
the
beer
warms
to
near
ambient
temperature
probably
the
best
serving
temperature
for
this
beer
a
fullflavored
and
bodied
beer
but
not
overly
thick
id
say
this
one
is
medium
in
mouth
feel
and
really
quite
luxurious
the
finish
is
dry
with
lingering
herbal
hops
on
the
tongue
probably
one
of
the
more
drinkable
winter
warmers
ive
sampled
this
season
and
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
as
well
very
complex
yet
not
overbearing
flavors
and
an
extremely
wellcrafted
mouth
feel
i
have
no
reservations
in
recommending
this
beer
to
both
the
lover
of
the
style
and
the
drinker
who
is
imbibing
in
a
winter
warmer
for
the
very
first
time
substantial
yet
accessible
very
very
nice
congratulations
boulevard
this
may
be
your
best
so
far
in
my
book
into
a
12oz
mug
this
is
a
very
cloudy
reddishamber
beer
with
a
very
small
head
nice
aroma
though
fruity
with
a
soft
sweet
maltiness
and
resinous
hop
notes
theres
a
hint
of
spiciness
as
well
taste
is
not
quite
as
interesting
caramel
malt
vies
with
moderate
bitterness
fruity
yeast
character
remains
but
largely
i
dont
find
the
flavor
very
interesting
body
is
a
tad
watery
head
billows
out
from
my
mug
at
the
bar
i
see
that
the
color
is
a
hazy
copper
in
my
friends
glass
my
mug
is
ceramic
somewhat
sweet
but
not
of
the
good
variety
in
the
nose
good
malt
to
hop
balance
mingled
with
usual
christmas
spices
ginger
cinnamon
maybe
some
orange
light
mouthfeel
followed
by
a
short
lived
aftertaste
not
the
best
for
the
style
d
a
hoppy
winter
warmer
with
nice
caramel
malt
for
balance
this
is
a
great
winter
seasonal
i
always
look
forward
to
this
its
a
good
winter
warmer
that
is
great
for
the
price
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
another
good
one
from
bully
overall
enjoyable

temp
seems
to
be
the
way
to
go
for
this
beer
good
winter
warmeri
hope
to
try
more
from
boulevard
when
im
in
k
c
over
the
holidays
while
the
hophead
in
me
would
love
to
see
them
bottle
some
of
the
dryhopped
nutcracker
that
they
had
at
the
kc
beer
fest
the
regular
nutcracker
is
a
very
wellplanned
and
wellmade
beer
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
and
the
only
one
i
know
of
with
fresh
hops
in
it
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
pretty
rubyamber
color
with
a
huge
viscous
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
surprisingly
hoppy
with
hints
of
caramel
malts
taste
is
citrusy
like
grapefruit
but
it
also
has
some
caramel
and
nutty
characteristics
the
alcohol
is
slightly
noticeable
and
does
have
a
slight
warming
effect
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
viscous
creamy
head
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
the
only
thing
that
takes
away
from
it
is
the
slightly
noticeable
alcohol
this
is
a
different
style
of
winter
warmer
than
i
am
used
to
tasting
but
it
is
enjoyable
and
i
would
pick
it
up
again
dark
fruits
come
first
toasted
grains
with
a
nutty
characteristic
bitterness
stings
the
tongue
leafy
and
spicy
hop
notes
light
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
grassy
hop
notes
come
through
as
it
warms
a
bit
more
pleasant
when
its
colder
id
pass
again
d
i
would
pass
on
this
next
time
its
interesting
thats
for
sure
its
just
a
very
odd
beer
its
trying
to
be
an
ipa
a
spiced
dark
beer
a
nut
brown
and
several
other
things
all
at
once
and
its
not
really
doing
any
of
them
well
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
sn
celebration
ale
just
nowhere
near
as
good
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
two
finger
creamy
head
lots
of
nice
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
hops
spices
and
caramel
the
taste
is
mostly
sweet
and
malt
with
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
little
winter
warmer
this
is
my
first
boulevard
brew
not
bad
at
all
nutcracker
ale
was
a
dark
amber
color
and
hazy
the
thick
tan
head
had
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
with
some
citric
hops
the
taste
was
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
it
started
a
little
sweet
with
plenty
of
caramel
malt
flavor
then
the
hops
kick
in
with
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
with
fruity
citrus
flavors
and
a
dry
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
from
boulevard
and
one
that
i
look
forward
to
every
winter
in
my
holiday
mixpack
this
beer
poured
a
red
brown
color
kind
of
like
tea
there
was
no
head
the
smell
on
this
one
was
rich
and
fruity
one
of
the
most
fragrant
aromic
beers
i
have
ever
smelled
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruity
tones
i
really
cant
describe
it
i
guess
kind
of
like
starfruit
this
beer
has
some
woody
notes
as
well
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
enjoyable
drinkability
on
this
one
is
very
high
for
me
what
a
great
great
beer
extremely
average
across
the
board
still
drinkable
but
very
unimpressive
compared
to
other
boulevard
beers
in
poker
parlance
nutcracker
ale
is
the
nuts
its
a
fantastic
winter
warmer
from
a
brewery
that
has
previously
impressed
me
with
only
two
beers
bully
porter
and
bobs
47
munich
style
lager
ive
never
seen
it
in
sixers
only
in
holiday
packs
but
ill
have
to
look
harder
from
now
on
kudos
to
the
boys
from
boulevard
for
this
flavorful
incredibly
drinkable
holiday
treat
pours
a
ruddy
brown
with
good
head
an
nice
fluffy
lacing
aroma
is
spicy
a
nutty
yeasty
very
abundant
and
some
sweet
bready
malts
permeate
a
pretty
decent
nose
taste
is
also
spicy
a
nicely
carbonated
mouth
that
lends
a
tactile
zest
to
the
slightly
woody
hopping
and
while
a
lovely
taste
and
decent
mouth
doesnt
really
register
as
a
warmer
id
be
interested
to
see
what
happens
if
i
sit
on
one
of
these
for
half
a
year
if
itd
mellow
out
and
round
off
into
something
a
little
nicer
we
shall
see
overall
this
reminds
me
of
an
imperial
nut
brown
ale
maybe
we
should
add
a
category
nice
winter
treat
a
lot
of
winter
beers
are
better
but
this
would
be
worth
a
6pack
every
winter
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
34
orangey
tan
head
over
the
very
cloudy
orangey
amber
brew
dense
head
lasts
well
with
plentiful
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
peaches
with
a
touch
of
piney
hops
taste
is
moderate
malts
with
a
fruitiness
in
the
middle
and
a
light
hoppiness
to
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
esp
for
a
winter
warmer
could
do
with
a
little
more
pop
in
the
flavor
area
but
at
least
they
didnt
overspice
d
way
too
easy
for
6
6
could
just
have
one
or
drink
with
a
meal
or
a
session
nice
my
favorite
winter
warmer
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
treat
and
a
very
good
offering
from
boulevard
i
rarely
buy
a
6
pack
but
i
did
buy
6
of
these
drinkability
was
fine
despite
the
simple
flavor
and
a
flavor
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
was
still
a
smooth
drinker
and
went
down
quickly
its
just
not
very
interesting
once
again
boulevard
manages
to
produce
craft
beer
which
is
boring
a
combination
which
seems
to
me
counterintuitive
boulevards
beers
are
wellmade
and
they
are
certainly
part
of
the
overall
trend
in
this
country
away
from
macrolager
crap
and
yet
they
insist
on
dumbing
it
down
with
the
possible
exception
of
their
bully
porter
which
at
least
to
my
mind
involves
some
level
of
contradiction
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
treat
and
a
very
good
offering
from
boulevard
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
to
have
around
as
the
weather
is
cold
note
somewhat
reminded
me
of
a
st
bernys
12
at
certain
points
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
i
have
had
lots
of
flavor
and
complexity
but
still
very
drinkable
make
sure
you
let
this
beer
warm
to
a
good
temperature
i
would
say
close
to
50
degrees
before
pouring
it
i
n
order
to
fully
appreciate
all
the
complexity
it
needs
to
be
warmer
than
most
brews
nice
to
see
my
home
state
brew
such
a
kick
ass
winter
warmer
this
is
just
about
a
perfect
beer
for
a
heavy
meal
edit
after
a
few
more
samples
i
find
that
the
hops
and
malt
are
more
balanced
than
what
i
said
in
my
review
so
ive
altered
my
score
to
reflect
that
this
is
good
stuff
thanks
beeryhandy
for
the
vertical
tasting
and
also
to
schmittymack
for
the
chance
to
taste
the
2009
version
within
the
freshness
date
as
good
as
the
2004
drinkability
is
decent
the
beer
is
good
but
there
are
other
winter
warmers
i
prefer
to
this
one
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
from
a
good
brewery
edit
the
boulevard
website
lists
this
as
31
ibu
which
is
fairly
low
for
a
6
6
beer
id
love
to
know
what
their
hop
schedule
is
to
get
all
that
chinook
character
pors
a
murky
dark
burgundy
with
a
creamy
tan
head
i
get
big
piney
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
faint
malty
sweetness
flavors
of
sweet
malt
are
followed
by
a
dominant
resinous
hop
presence
without
spicing
the
pineyness
gives
it
a
good
holiday
feel
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
full
with
a
touch
of
sweet
stickiness
and
lovely
carbonation
very
drinkable
its
refreshing
to
find
christmas
beers
that
dont
rely
on
spicing
that
aside
this
was
a
really
interesting
beer
anda
great
approach
to
the
winter
warmer
it
is
complex
warming
and
festive
without
being
heavy
thick
slick
or
overwhelmingly
boozy
not
what
id
call
balanced
but
very
enjoyable
none
the
less
appears
cloudy
nearly
opaque
amber
almost
marron
hued
nice
sized
caramel
tan
head
leaves
fine
lacing
aroma
contains
a
great
hop
profile
christmas
tree
esque
piney
character
nice
doughy
malt
not
overly
sweet
thank
god
no
holiday
spices
to
kill
it
finishes
a
bit
citrusy
sort
of
celebration
like
but
unique
and
its
own
taste
is
one
great
hoppy
winter
warmer
once
again
thanking
the
beer
gods
that
some
brewers
leaves
out
holiday
spices
and
substitue
semi
sweet
caramel
malt
profiles
with
yeasty
bread
chacter
blended
with
a
wallop
of
pine
cone
and
citrus
flavored
hops
nicely
done
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
texture
is
silky
smooth
of
course
carbonation
is
perfect
why
mess
it
up
now
drinkability
effortless
bc
its
so
good
yet
challenging
due
to
the
flavors
that
one
could
without
a
doubt
crave
ive
always
enjoyed
the
nutcracker
from
boulevard
this
years
was
the
best
ive
tried
good
brew
thanks
go
out
to
bditty187
for
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
hop
scent
that
pretty
much
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
malt
aroma
it
seems
to
be
boasting
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
complex
flavor
that
screams
hops
but
is
blended
well
with
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
bittersweet
with
some
residual
malt
sugars
and
a
wonderful
hop
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
it
has
excellent
hop
character
and
a
well
rounded
malt
bill
a
good
seasonal
still
strangely
admirable
i
recommend
you
pick
up
one
bottle
just
to
see
what
is
see
experience
the
funk
many
thanks
to
dertbert
for
providing
me
the
oppurtunity
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
sharing
this
beer
i
had
this
last
christmas
also
and
it
was
very
consistent
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
at
all
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
outstanding
either
a
solid
above
average
but
not
above
a
b
maybe
b
still
ill
drink
it
again
in
the
future
wow
just
wow
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
but
the
best
seasonal
ive
had
since
fall
ended
is
far
and
away
this
beer
drinkability
is
very
solid
really
enjoyable
kind
of
beer
that
you
cant
just
have
one
of
i
have
not
have
this
brew
for
several
years
and
much
better
than
earlier
versions
that
i
remembered
drinkability
enjoyable
in
moderation
a
solid
winter
seasonal
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
would
not
discourage
anyone
from
giving
this
a
try
if
they
have
the
chance
overall
a
decent
drink
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
the
more
the
citrus
and
bitterness
lingers
in
my
mouth
the
more
it
makes
me
want
to
go
get
an
esb
definitely
worth
the
try
a
nice
xmaswinter
offering
the
use
of
the
chinook
hops
are
the
star
of
this
brew
and
im
enjoying
it
immensely
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
aw
jeez
said
like
john
travolta
this
stuff
smells
like
a
friggin
pine
tree
its
head
remains
for
quite
a
respectable
amount
of
time
im
sure
its
being
helped
along
by
the
wheat
included
in
the
malt
its
definitely
a
red
chocolate
color
the
taste
is
complex
yet
understated
and
you
really
have
to
swish
it
around
in
your
mouth
to
get
the
full
impression
on
every
part
of
your
toungue
its
absolutely
uncanny
how
much
this
smells
and
tastes
like
a
pine
tree
it
should
be
tried
just
for
that
its
slightly
sweet
on
the
finish
and
the
pine
taste
does
linger
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
body
for
a
beer
that
is
so
smooth
a
slight
smoky
flavor
surrounds
and
binds
the
whole
experience
which
is
welcomed
a
warming
sensation
becomes
apparent
and
this
beer
has
thus
fullfilled
its
destiny
aroma
of
piney
chinook
hops
vinous
oak
barrel
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
similar
flavors
with
dark
fruit
and
just
preceptable
diacetyl
upping
the
complexity
full
body
that
made
the
mouthfeel
a
dextrinous
treat
to
hold
on
to
before
swallowing
finishes
toasty
and
sweet
then
the
drying
hops
as
an
aftertaste
almost
an
english
style
strong
ale
this
is
what
i
was
hoping
for
when
i
picked
up
the
christmas
ale
from
glbc
sometime
all
you
are
looking
for
is
close
to
home
score
a
big
sucess
for
boulevard
b
c
to
go
along
with
their
outstanding
bully
porter
and
saison
the
taste
if
anything
is
more
definitely
grapefruit
and
pine
over
a
nice
caramel
malt
base
hints
of
apple
as
well
as
plum
lingering
spicy
finish
and
aftertaste
from
the
bottle
i
shared
this
with
bieristgut
poured
a
mahogany
with
light
tan
head
aroma
sour
grapes
honey
malts
apples
the
sour
kind
grapefruit
molasses
flavor
caramel
mustywheat
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
a
little
weak
but
not
to
bad
whoa
lot
more
ummph
than
the
regular
boulevard
pale
ale
much
darker
pour
a
hazy
dark
amber
with
great
head
didnt
have
a
lot
of
aroma
but
left
laces
all
the
way
down
the
pint
glass
this
winter
warmer
had
a
nice
woody
spicy
taste
that
finished
with
a
hoppy
kick
nice
tingle
in
the
mouth
and
smooth
going
down
will
look
forward
to
next
years
boulevard
batch
the
taste
as
usual
was
the
best
part
the
sip
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
with
a
well
blanced
hop
character
in
the
finish
this
doesnt
quite
have
as
big
of
a
kick
as
many
winter
warmers
ive
had
in
the
past
but
i
could
taste
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
so
i
could
tell
it
was
doing
its
job
i
will
definately
drink
more
of
this
next
year
pours
a
murky
amber
and
has
a
thick
tan
head
it
has
a
spicy
hop
nose
and
the
spicy
character
comes
through
in
the
flavor
and
covers
up
the
alcohol
very
well
it
is
not
too
complex
at
all
very
straight
forward
in
its
flavor
this
is
a
really
good
winter
warmer
i
will
be
revisiting
this
bier
again
next
year
kudos
to
boulevard
for
a
very
good
winter
ale
overall
impression
not
my
cup
of
hop
tea
no
real
malt
tastes
not
much
spice
to
put
it
in
a
winter
mood
an
enjoyable
beer
but
a
bit
different
big
props
to
babydoc
who
set
me
up
with
the
generous
trade
my
second
boulevard
thanks
to
babydoc
this
one
pours
a
muddy
brownunfiltered
body
with
a
1
cm
beige
head
that
disperses
some
nice
patchy
lace
aroma
is
malty
and
spicy
with
notes
of
chocolate
caramel
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
some
grassy
hops
are
picked
up
in
the
background
very
pleasant
in
the
mouth
with
an
ideal
carbonation
and
tingly
body
taste
is
quite
pleasant
with
malty
chocolate
and
caramel
maltiness
melding
with
grassy
and
pine
hops
a
hint
of
hazelnut
and
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
although
i
cook
with
fresh
spices
i
have
been
deceived
before
by
noting
the
definite
presence
of
spices
that
were
actually
hops
as
may
be
the
case
here
this
is
an
excellent
winter
warmer
that
is
quite
well
constructed
i
wish
boulevard
could
expand
their
distribution
a
bit
so
more
of
us
could
enjoy
their
fine
brews
pretty
nice
one
of
boulevards
better
brews
a
nice
beer
overall
poured
from
a
2004
bottle
labled
best
before
020105
the
unfiltered
brew
pours
slightly
hazy
mahogany
nice
curtains
of
bubbles
head
is
one
finger
slightlyyellow
wheat
fading
to
a
veil
that
lasts
until
the
end
nose
is
pleasant
but
not
potent
spicy
flowery
nice
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
yielding
a
creamy
feel
but
faily
dry
finish
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
and
light
spices
hops
interrupt
the
sweetness
to
balance
but
not
overpower
it
despite
the
added
spices
attributed
to
it
by
some
tasters
the
ingredients
list
only
tworow
barley
malt
whole
hops
and
yeast
very
nice
not
quite
as
hearty
as
id
hoped
but
certainly
drinkable
and
one
of
my
boulevard
choices
overall
this
is
yet
another
winter
warmer
that
ill
be
passing
up
next
year
this
a
great
unheralded
holiday
brew
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
is
perfect
for
a
winter
warmer
the
flavor
sits
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
rolls
forward
closing
on
a
hoppy
chinook
finish
there
is
a
pretty
good
head
and
retention
i
could
drink
it
all
night
whoa
unlike
any
boulevard
selection
ive
had
previously
pours
brown
with
a
single
finger
head
smells
a
bit
spicey
some
nut
chocolate
but
perhaps
some
nutmeg
the
big
difference
between
this
and
normal
boulevard
offerings
is
the
mouthfeel
and
sweet
malt
thicker
and
sweeter
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
and
stamina
building
umph
nutty
and
xmas
spice
to
taste
plus
lotsa
interesting
flavors
as
it
warms
licorice
hint
of
chocolate
nutmeg
clove
and
other
holiday
spices
the
best
selection
from
boulevard
ive
tried
yet
and
ive
tried
them
all
repeatedly
wish
they
could
impart
this
mouthfeel
and
malt
sweet
to
their
pale
ale
it
has
a
excellent
mainly
malty
taste
that
is
very
well
balanced
with
great
body
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
it
really
makes
me
want
to
try
some
of
boulevards
others
a
rich
mahagony
brown
body
is
topped
by
a
fleeting
bigbubbled
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
heavy
on
the
nuts
with
backup
notes
of
caramel
and
toast
theres
also
a
bit
of
baking
spices
maybe
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
theyre
not
overpowering
the
flavor
is
richly
malty
and
slightly
fruity
pretty
tasty
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
rose
amber
that
is
just
slightly
murky
and
with
a
massive
head
that
settles
a
bit
but
sticks
around
nicely
for
some
time
the
nose
is
full
of
floral
hops
maybe
just
a
hint
of
spice
taste
is
sweatbitter
hops
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
very
enjoyable
mouth
feel
is
spot
on
nothing
out
of
place
well
balanced
all
around
one
of
boulevards
better
brews
i
think
drinkability
my
overall
impression
was
that
this
was
not
a
repeat
beer
i
had
3
of
them
so
far
but
only
because
im
out
of
anything
else
to
drink
i
forced
the
other
3
on
company
taste
hits
in
waves
sweetness
then
hops
then
the
warmth
of
alcohol
good
drinking
for
the
holidays
maybe
better
than
last
year
this
brew
is
a
hazy
murky
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
resulting
from
a
nice
cascading
effect
scent
has
some
spice
maybe
some
ginger
the
main
taste
that
comes
through
is
nuttiness
some
spicyness
rounding
that
out
underlying
bitter
hops
not
a
horrible
one
but
id
turn
to
some
other
winter
favorites
before
this
one
taste
starts
with
the
sweet
cookie
malt
spices
festively
ring
in
but
arent
over
the
top
like
they
are
in
some
holiday
ales
bitter
yet
spicy
hop
bite
lifts
the
sweetness
into
the
yeasty
finish
medium
plus
bodied
with
a
moderately
creamy
feel
a
very
respectable
xmas
ale

enjoyed

a
beautiful
chestnut

with
a
reddish
cast

nose
reveals
a
combination
of
light
spice
and
delicate
spruce
or
pine
wrapped
in
a
caramelish
and
slightly
biscuity
malt
its
medium
bodied
and
its
median
carbonation
lends
a
gentle
zest
to
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
slightly
richer
than
the
nose
suggests
but
delivers
the
same
basic
profile
with
hops
arriving
up
front
and
giving
way
to
its
maltiness
towards
the
finish
cellaring
this
beer
for
a
year
however
softens
the
hop
presence
and
allows
the
malt
to
become
more
dominant

this
works
well
this
one
is
well
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
and
i
suspect
that
although
this
is
close
to
its
best
by
date
a
little
aging
matures
this
beer
no
end
taste
winter
ales
as
a
style
arent
a
common
quaff
for
me
but
this
is
a
pleasant
example

well
made
i
dont
detect
a
lot
of
hops
since
im
an
old
hophead
that
left
me
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
the
flavour
of
this

went
well

for

try

full

a
nice

good
for

a

rather
nice
bready

some

a

away
to

a

in

maybe
a
little

would
smooth
it
out
definately
a
drinkable
brew
though
not
my
favorite
from
boulevard
ill
probably
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
every
year
but
thats
about
it
with
the
higher
abv
though
it
makes
a
nice
winter
warmer
a
very
nice
ale
to
accompany
one
on
colder
nights

as
this

and
floral

the
yeast
is
noticeable
the
flavors
on
the
palate
are
again
a
fine
blend
of
sweet
sugary
malt
like
candy
with
some
hops
in
the
background
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
a
note
of
citrus
can
be
detected
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
internal

effect
that
many
winter
beers
have

the

shy

seems
overall
creamy
due

carbonation
flavor
impression
strikes
as
slightly
gingerbread
malt
with
a
touch
of
a
minty
aspect
finishes
with
barely
discernable
hops
but
a
building
fruitcake
character
and
a
flattish
tone
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
time
of
year
a
little
festive
but
despite
the
claim
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
pretty
transparent
unfiltered
brew
reminds
me
a
little
of
the

well
done
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
not
a
huge
winter
beer
like
others
on
the
market
but
it
is
by
no
means
a
wimp
nicely
balanced
notes
the
first
sampling
in
an
8
pack
of
four
different
boulevard
beers
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
just
didnt
have
that
winter
beer
warmness
nice
winter
beer
it
tastes
like
a
higher
alcohol
beer
in
spite
of
its
lower
than
expected
abv
it
has
a
homebrewy
yeasty
nose
nice
balance
of
malty
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
another
solid
brew
from
boulevard
this
is
a
beer
that
id
like
to
have
all
year
round
but
ill
settle
for
the
christmas
season
this
beer
and
snow
cap
make
me
feel
good
thanks
bditty187
for
the
trade
so
i
could
review
this
beer
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
bronze
in
hue
covered
by
a
beige
head
w
decent
retention
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
piney
chinook
and
assertive
dark
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
sweet
and
sprucelike
mellow
diacetyl
surfaces
as
the
beer
breathes
flavorwise
the
initial
moderate
hop
bitterness
fades
and
allows
rich
chewy
caramel
and
biscuit
to
dominate
mild
dark
fruit
esters
and
butterscotch
provide
some
complexity
caramel
malt
presence
builds
from
a
simpler
sweetness
into
a
deeply
caramelized
slightly
burnt
impresion
w
lingers
on
the
palate
agreeably
subdued
but
discernibly
piney
hop
flavor
full
in
body
and
quite
dextrinous
considering
its
average
strength
finishes
toasty
and
cleanly
sweet
nutcracker
is
quite
a
flavorful
and
rich
brew
that
belies
its
low
apparent
strength
i
have
doubts
this
is
only
5
3
abv
flavorwise
it
more
is
akin
to
a
strong
ale
rather
than
an
american
brown
excellent
drinkability
this
is
the
2002
release
brew
was
better
balanced
hop
char
chinook
when
tasted
in
2001
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
brew
overall
with
a
great
drinkinability
nice
light
warming
feel
and
just
enough
spice
to
balance
the
sweet
this
is
a
fairly
unique
beer
and
quite
unlike
most
winter
warmers
ive
tried
the
weird
aroma
is
just
a
tad
overbearing
but
it
drinks
well
overall
o
decent
but
unexceptional
brown
ale
a
standard
yet
well
done
winter
warmer
though
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
would
have
liked
to
have
drank
it
when
it
was
a
bit
more
fresh
o
a
fairly
decent
drinker
this
is
a
lighter
winter
warmer
that
doesnt
go
overboard
on
spices
or
other
adjuncts
i
had
low
expectations
and
they
were
met
not
as
big
and
bold
as
some
holiday
ales
yet
a
solid
effort
overall
the
malt
sugars
are
warm
and
inviting
and
cling
to
the
palate
slowly
dissolving
and
leaving
a
nice
hop
bitterness
and
slight
brown
sugar
aftertaste
perhaps
not
the
epitome
of
a
winter
warmer
but
tasty
and
inviting
all
the
same
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
quite
a
winter
warmer
for
me
more
like
a
winter
lukewarmer
but
good
nonetheless
mouth
follows
through
on
the
slight
tart
cherryish
feel
with
a
nearly
raisiny
not
quite
spicey
hanger
on
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
with
a
slight
pucker
not
really
a
solo
beer
but
one
that
is
going
to
be
an
enabler
at
the
table
in
the
pre
and
post
dinner
categories
of
the
evenings
drinking
should
pair
well
with
chocolate
and
some
other
things
that
utilize
chocolate
and
fruit
and
also
of
course
meat
and

to
remind
you
its
from

sweet

flavors
and

become
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
and
to
think
i
almost
didnt
get
this
at
all
great
winter
beer
overall
unique
but
better
straight
from
the
fridge
and
out
of
the

still
its
something
i
find
myself
seeking
out

its
in

work

the

way
in

the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
spices
and
fruits
now
not
quite
as
dark
but
not
quite
undark
to
not
be
called
dark
anymore

throughout
the

is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
spicy
winter
warmer
something
i
wouldnt
mind
enjoying
time
to
time
during
these
cold
months
overall
not
bad
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
an
enjoyable
beer
certainly
a
malt
forward
beer
with
some
caramel
and
fruit
but
nothing
too
bold
hops
add
possibly
a
some
earthy
spicyness
but
not
much
more
was
hoping
for
more
pronounced
overall
flavor
this
one
felt
a
little
thin
for
the
style
but
still
was
quite
drinkable
certainly
hides
the
alcohol
well
there
were
no
real
issues
with
this
beer
but
its
a
bit
bland
for
a
winter
warmer
o
this
used
to
be
a
favorite
but
i
havent
been
impressed
with
it
in
recent
years
was
afraid
i
had
grown
out
of
this
beginner
beer
that
may
be
true
but
i
was
really
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
one
key
to
enjoying
this
beer
is
to
drink
it
on
the
colder
side
not
much
of
a
compliment
i
know
and
definitely
pour
carefully
i
will
continue
to
pick
this
up
every
year
for
old
times
sake
and
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
style

overall
pleasant

kind
of
characterless
unlike

from

a
fair
enough

lacking
in
the

areas
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice

some

only
slightly
enhanced
with

very
woody

earthy
with

comes
across
as
a
little
fake
overall
this
is
a
fair
quaff
overall
not
really
a
fan
of
this
warmer
at
all
maybe
im
just
not
of
a
fan
of
how
they
presented
this
style
i
guess
im
just
more
of
a
fan
of
a
maltier
style
warmer
low
c
overall
this
is
always
one
of
my
favorite
december
beers
great
flavor
and
feel
overall
a
great
looking
beer
that
has
a
very
off
flavor
that
ruins
it
for
me
o
above
average
but
not
killer
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite

one
of
my

favorites
ive
had
in

really
bland
the
smell
and
taste
leave
a

to
be
desiredthe
name
suggests
that
its
a
holiday
seasonal
but
the
lack
of
any
real
spice
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
is
confusingit
sets
me
up
for
something
that
im
not
gettingeven
beyond
that
the
beer

conclusion
i
was
afraid
of
this
bridgeport
makes
appealing
looking
beers
but
it
seems
that
they
often
fall
short
with
the
execution
so
many
craft
brewers
big
and
small
these
days
are
making
really
fine
beer
so
to
produce
mediocre
beer
just
doesnt
cut
it
bridgeport
loves
to
tout
their
position
as
the
oldest
craft
brewer
in
oregon
but
it
seems
that
they
havent
updated
their
beer
to
compete
with
the
ever
more
and
more
refined
and
perfected
craft
industry
for
example
this
beer
cant
stand
up
to
other
winter
beers
like
jubel
hibernation
or
even
the
mild
mannered
samuel
smiths
winter
welcome
this
isnt
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
there
are
just
too
many
better
options
to
ever
buy
or
drink
it
again
in
this
price
segment
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
good
as
many
others
of
the
style
this
frankly
felt
like
more
of
a
dark
almostanipa
than
a
winter
warmer
too
me
i
think
this
beer
would
have
been
improved
with
more
spices
and
a
little
bit
less
hops
pours
dark
mahogany
with
a
fluffy
ivory
head
that
settles

a
thick
cap

aromas
of

and
some
winter
spices
similar
to
the
nose
sweet

and
toffee

orange

hops
brown

and
some

mouthfeel
is
fairly

nothing

packages
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
its
a
decent
winter
warmer
not
my
favorite
but
good
enough
for
inclusion
in
a
mixed
twelvesky
o
bah
humbug
as
far
as
winter
warmers
go
this
was
nothing
spectacular
easy
drinking
and
a
good
tasting
beer
overall
but
lacked
the
warm
booziness
i
expected
i
could
see
knocking
out
a
six
pack
fairly
quick
overall
nice
little
treat
that
delivers
a
strong
malty
flavor
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
in
the
end
o
not
a
great
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
i
would
drink
it
if
its
put
in
front
of
me
though
as
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
say
highly
mediocre
o
ebenezer
doesnt
make
me
go
bahumbug
but
im
not
convinced
this
is
something
that
will
compliment
my
winter
instead
the
hops
used
remind
me
of
harvest
and
fall
throwing
me
off
balance
this
bridgeport
offering
is
a
good
entry
to
winter
warmers
as
thanksgiving
and
the
colder
weather
approaches
but
not
one
im
looking
to
return
to
as
the
snow
drifts
set
in
overall
pretty
disappointing
no
brew
date
but
total
wine
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
selling
out
their
seasonals
so
i
gotta
think
this
is
fresh
i
just
dont
see
any
appeal
in
this
beer
absolutely
no
depth
or
complexity
with
this
winter
warmer
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
but
i
personally
dont
like
the
taste
much
it
seems
to
be
a
beer
of
great
quality
but
its
just
not
my
thing
a
light
caramel
taste
that
brings
with
it
a
lot
of
extras
that
holds
the
caramel
notes
in
check
resulting
in
a
pretty
good
beer
i
love
the
rich
and
full
flavor
of
this
beer
it
was
a
christmas
present
from
my
broinlaw
this
beer
turned
me
on
to
bridgeport
since
then
i
have
visited
their
facility
in
portland
and
they
are
my
favorite
pacific
nw
beer
if
you
have
no
other
beer
from
bridgeport
try
this
one
ov
very
good
winter
warmer
medium
bodied
with
warming
spices
and
a
balanced
profile
poured
from
undated
bottle
to
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
rich
clear
copper
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
tan
colored
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
a
pleasant
mix
of
earthy
hops
and
caramel
malts
together
with
a
biscuit
bread
tone
in
the
nose
the
beer
is
more
balanced
than
the
nose
lets
on
with
a
earthy
pine
hop
and
mild
bitterness
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
a
spicy
note
as
well
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
caramel
malt
flavor
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
little
late
in
the
for
a
winter
warmer
but
it
was
nice
solid
winter
warmer
smells
malty
and
sweet
and
fruity
and
guess
what
it
is
exactly
that
there
is
a
fruity
flavor
that
presents
itself
up
front
with
a
sturdy
wintery
malt
backing
feels
good
in
the
mouth
pushing
full
bodied
with
the
right
carbonation
and
abv
for
the
season
its
not
unique
in
any
way
but
it
is
well
made
and
well
priced
worthy
first
beer
from
this
place
o
ebenezer
looks
great
and
smells
and
tastes
good
a
fuller
body
would
not
hurt
this
one
not
bad
but
not
spectacular
as
winter
warmers
go
o
not
bad
but
nothing
special
im
happy
i
got
it
in
a
gift
basket
instead
of
buying
it
o
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
there
is
definately
room
for
improvement
but
good
still
to
say
the
least
medium
body
with
natural
carbonation
mostly
soft
but
a
touch
sharp
on
the
finish
quite
drinkable
overall
not
that
bad
but
nothing
id
go
looking
for
i
do
suppose
this
is
a
very
aproachable
winter
warmer
o
the
smell
was
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
which
looked
unappetizing
and
tasted
average
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
foamy
light
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thick
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
dark
fruits
and
some
mild
spice
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
fruit
spices
and
a
slight
vegetal
flavor
on
the
finish
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
winter
warmer
in
my
book
nothing
too
offensive
but
nothing
that
great
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
more
flamoyant
ipas
i
dunno
if
malty
beers
without
much
flavor
behind
them
are
your
thing
then
i
would
recommend
at
least
there
are
no
off
flavors
really
decent
englishstyle
winter
warmer
balanced
between
a
biscuit
fruit
cake
and
treacle
malt
body
and
a
brief
flash
of
earthy
hop
bitterness
more
of
either
would
be
appreciated
but
i
can
still
find
plenty
to
like
from
a
balanced
easydrinking
valuepriced
ale
the
fullness
and
mouthfeel
is
the
only
major
detriment
way
too
thin
for
anything
meant
to
fortify
one
in
cold
weather
if
it
had
a
bit
more
of
a
nose
and
bit
less
alcohol
heat
this
would
be
a
serial
repeater
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
well
made
christmas
ale
though
i
feel
it
would
benefit
a
lot
from
aging
i
appreciated
the
low
abv
it
drinks
like
a
much
stronger
beer
certainly
worth
a
taste
this
is
very
simple
subtle
but
all
around
enjoyable
i
will
be
buying
more
something
i
would
recommend
o
no
thanks
has
good
color
and
nice
smell
smell
is
actually
very
good
not
too
heavy
or
overbearing
you
can
taste
the
hops
but
they
are
subtle
malt
is
present
as
well
and
is
more
pronounced
than
the
hops
are
over
all
it
is
nice
seasonal
beer
for
winter
not
top
of
that
category
but
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
mostly
clear
copper

heavily
spiced

some

flavor

by
those
holiday
spices
faintly
indian
a
slight
malty

swells
up
and
the
finish
is
long
and
spicy
not
my
favorite
style
but
pretty
nice
mouthfeel
not
much
body
floral
aftertaste
holds
on
a
long
while
this
has
been
in
the
basement
for
a
few
months
and
seems
to
have
lost
a
bit
of
the
sweetness
i
remember
but
quite
clean
and
highly
drinkable
overall
i
rate
high
as
i
go
back
and
forth
between
this
and
jubelale
as
my
winter
refreshment
this
is
just
a
little
lighter
than
jubel
so
depending
on
how
i
feel
it
hits
the
spot
drinkability
good
for
the
style
there
arent
really
any
problems
with
this
beer
its
decent
and
enjoyable
but
bland
for
a
winter
warmer
ive
yet
to
be
impressed
by
a
winter
warmer
and
sadly
ebenezer
is
no
exception
that
being
said
it
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
but
theres
still
so
much
room
for
improvement
its
a
great
value
though
and
so
drinkable
that
id
be
happy
to
purchase
it
again
to
see
me
through
next
winter
whilst
continuing
my
hunt
for
something
better
very
flavorful
and
sessionable
winter
warmer
that
has
just
a
little
abv
warmth
on
the
finish
nose
on
this
is
fantastic
screams
of
christmas
unfortunately
the
taste
doesnt
match
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
was
also
surprisingly
thin
this
beer
should
be
bigger
not
bad
though
not
overly
exciting
but
somewhat
drinkable
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
drinkability
is
fine
and
the
6er
will
be
enjoyed
id
enjoy
it
more
if
it
was
more
focused
if
that
makes
any
sense
my
older
brother
sent
me
some
christmas
goodies
from
the
nw
this
year
i
was
excited
to
see
this
in
the
mix
the
label
has
a
great
old
timey
illustration
of
scrooge
and
pours
a
somewhat
foogy
amber
color
it
smelled
like
dull
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
taste
hinted
at
warm
holiday
flavors
like
the
scent
but
is
surrounded
by
a
more
malty
taste
its
smooth
and
good
for
drinkin
but
lacked
the
holiday
punch
i
was
hoping
for
poured
a
cloudy
dark
amber
minimal
tan

with
next
to
nothing

ebenezer
indeed

on

not

else
im
sorry
to
say
on
the
palate
a
warm
fruity
spicey
citrus
affair
with
a
medium

fooled
me

would
have
to

than

is
that
treacle
a
bit
of
roast
and
spicy
brown
bread
noble
hops
taste
pretty
sweet
up
front
mirrors
the
nose
but
hops
are
pretty
faint
at
best
mouthfeel
on
the
full
side
of
medium
average
effervescence
some
stickiness
decent
drinkability
could
have
several
of
these
though
the
sweetness
ends
up
being
a
trifle
cloying
ive
been
drinking
ebenezer
throughout
the
years
its
a
great
winter
brew
try
it
out
if
you
want
something
with
a
rich
flavor
but
without
the
heaviness
pretty
good
winter
warmer
nothing
too
amazing
a
great
beer
to
have
by
the
fire

on

a
slight
cinnamon
flavor
not
added
as
a
spice
i
think
but
hinted
at
somehow
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
chewy
and
the
bitterness
lingers
but
these
qualities
are
balanced
by
a
good
sharp
bite
as
i
say
about
the
smell
the
flavor
is
a
bit
understated
for
a
christmasholiday
brew
but
it
is
quite
good
overall
has
qualities
similar
to
english
bitter
ales
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
not
as
thick
as
i
was
hoping
from
a
winter
warmer
it
does
have
a
slight
creamy
coating
mouth
presence
with
crisp
carbonation
the
finish
is
very
roasty
and
dry
aiding
drinkability
its
a
good
beer
but
i
was
left
wanting
more
poured
with
lovely
big
foamy
frothy
fluffy
cream
colored
head
that
lasted
a
while
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
medium
amber
aroma
is
malt
and
a
little
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
is
similar
with
a
little
roast
added
along
with
some
sweet
solvernt
body
is
decent
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
but
ends
up
with
the
sweet
solvent
thing
soft
on
palate
hate
to
say
it
but
a
bit
watery
feel
bready
flavors
light
spicy
hop
backing
nice
malt
backbone
decent
for
style
mouthfeel
lacking
danother
soso
beer
from
bridgeport
although
a
local
brewery
they
must
have
a
different
merchandising
arrangement
than
full
sail
widmer
and
deschutes
because
i
almost
never
see
bridgeport
on
sale
thus
i
rarely
buy
i
sought
out
a
winter
beer
that
i
could
drink
in
quantity
and
found
it
expect
the
unexpected
with
this
ale
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
long
lasting
head
there
is
a
slight
scent
to
it
but
nothing
that
stands
out
it
was
quite
heavy
for
an
ale
while
there
was
a
slight
nutty
taste
very
slightly
bitter
but
finished
quite
smooth
a
very
nice
find
and
something
i
would
suggest
to
others
an
ok
brew
here
it
grew
on
me
at
the
end
but
not
enough
to
improve
the
scores
any
its
like
a
spicy
winter
toddy
im
not
entirely
thrilled
with
anything
in
particular
about
this
beer
but
its
still
fairly
enjoyable
from
a
unique
sipping
experience
its
something
that
must
be
tried
to
understand
the
interesting
flavors
in
this
one
overall
this
beer
has
character
it
is
aptly
named
and
a
great
addition
to
winter
beers
drinkability
mildly
complex
worth
buying
a
sixpack
of
and
a
decent
taste
in
general
the
aftertaste
is
mild
enough
to
make
the
bitterness
bearable
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
nose
brings
a
small
amount
of
spice
forward
i
think
im
getting
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
never
entirely
sure
i
really
need
to
start
having
these
beers
with
my
spice
rack
nearby
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
in
there
as
well
taste
is
a
bit
of
doughy
bread
with
light
caramel
and
some
spice
light
to
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
levels
not
at
all
overspiced
this
drank
pretty
well
this
was
the
first
winter
warmer
ive
had
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
base
it
off
of
so
from
my
opinion
despite
my
lack
of
experience
in
this
field
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
beer
appearance
was
sort
of
dark
amber
smell
was
rather
pleasant
malty
as
far
as
tatse
goes
to
me
this
felt
like
it
had
raw
vanilla
in
it
some
may
say
cheap
vodka
but
i
think
they
dont
know
what
theyre
talking
about
those
people
should
stop
trying
to
analyze
beer
and
just
enjoy
it
and
thats
what
this
beer
is
for
enjoyment
it
felt
great
to
drink
and
wasnt
heavy
like
stouts
or
most
darker
beers
thanks
bridgeport
for
this
great
beer
drink
is
not
great
as
well
because
of
the
taste
i
hope
this
isnt
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
like
have
not
had
this
beer
for
quite
awhile
and
i
liked
the
caramel
notes
that
swirled
up
in
the
midbody
as
the
beer
warmed
up
not
as
hoppy
or
as
thick
a
mouthfeel
as
jubelale
but
satisfying
in
its
own
way
this
beer
is
a
classic
winter
warmer
that
shows
more
reliance
on
the
malt
than
the
hops
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
though
i
dont
feel
driven
to
over
all
not
a
bad
winter
ale

surprise
very
good
beer
enough
to
make
me
take
another
look
at
a
category
of
beer
that
id
nearly
written
off
picked
this
at
a
liqour
stotres
winter
closeouts
section
good
value
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
bridgeport
but
they
always
seem
to
be
kind
of
hit
or
miss
this
was
in
the
middle
not
much
for
a
winter
beer
overmalty
but
nothing
else
this
was
very
drinkable
at
6
4
but
thats
it
overall
pretty
plain
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
for
a
seasonal
good
winter
warmer
very
rich
and
caramelly
could
perhaps
use
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
imo
had
2
more
of
these
the
following
week
not
as
impressive
less
like
a
barleywine
more
like
a
cider
complexity
not
there
as
much
overall
this
is
a
fine
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
wish
everything
in
it
was
kicked
up
just
a
bit
more
but
overall
this
one
is
a
good
choice
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
well
balanced
with
some
nice
complexities
not
found
in
current
vintage
i
think
this
beer
has
gotten
much
better
with
a
year
of
age
highly
recommend
drinkability
this
is
one
winter
warmer
which
goes
down
easy
big
hop
aroma
combined
with
a
more
classic
malty
flavor
make
this
a
pretty
good
selection
its
smooth
roasty
malty
and
just
did
it
for
me
on
the
blustery
winter
day
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
creamy
with
low
carbonation
aroma
is
quite
strong
mainly
spicy
and
slightly
sweet
and
has
an
evergreen
component
making
it
smell
somewhat
like
a
good
ipa
it
pours
a
dark
somewhat
hazy
warm
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
offwhite
head
spicy
malty
flavor
has
a
decided
hoppy
undertone
and
is
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
texture
is
fizzy
and
zingy
yet
smooth
and
slick
happy
whateveryoucelebratethistimeofyear
d
very
drinkable
super
tasty
and
something
im
going
to
buy
every
season
body
is
smooth
full
but
not
particularly
rich
this
is
fine
as
a
rich
body
would
overwhelm
the
relatively
mild
flavors
of
this
winter
ale
the
mildness
contributes
to
this
being
a
particularly
sessionable
winter
ale
not
the
most
interesting
of
the
winter
offerings
from
oregon
breweries
but
it
is
one
of
the
most
consistently
enjoyable
winter
ales
around
overall
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
for
an
oregon
winter
warmer
this
is
a
noble
attempt
at
a
winter
warmer
from
a
great
brewery
i
am
spoiled
here
in
portland
because
we
have
so
many
great
brewpups
who
spend
an
insane
amount
of
time
and
effort
on
their
winter
seasonal
brews
so
this
one
fell
short
it
lacks
the
balance
i
typically
attribute
to
bridgeport
brews
i
will
taste
from
bottle
and
reassess
soon
drinkability
lots
of
abv
but
little
taste
to
make
up
for
it
not
very
good
overall
to
me
that
is
english
and
after
reading
that
and
drinking
more
and
loving
english
brews
and
esbs
and
being
mostly
english
i
noticed
this
is
much
like
your
average
spicy
esb
and
tasty
for
such
as
that
not
bad
at
all
and
kudos
this
winter
seasonal
poured
a
dark
amber
color
sweet
caramel
with
cherry
notes
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
nutty
caramel
with
cherries
in
the
finish
smooth
feel
with
ample
carbonation
good
brew
subtle
maltiness
is
reminiscent
of
english
beers
smooth
and
warming
perfect
for
the
season
recommended
too
cold
though
and
this
is
heavy
yet
bland
and
becomes
tiresome
quickly
it
tastes
of
burnt
alcoholic
candy
toasted
crackers
with
vague
hints
of
sweet
citrus
ultimately
a
toastycaramelly
citrusy
sweetness
with
alcoholic
bite
when
cold
it
seems
thin
despite
the
heavy
character
d
a
must
when
i
get
together
with
family
over
christmas
break
my
brother
and
i
always
manage
to
put
back
a
few
of
these
but
note
the
buzz
builds
fast
single
bottle
bought
from
greens
poured
dark
brown
with
a
healthy
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
and
leaves
some
lacing
smells
of
mixed
dried
fruit
bubblegum
and
spice
the
bubblegum
taste
starts
things
off
in
the
mouth
as
well
then
it
shifts
to
pine
and
spices
with
a
bit
of
maltlurking
in
the
background
pleasant
and
a
bit
different
for
a
winter
warmer
slightly
tannic
in
the
mouth
could
be
a
bit
smoother
still
i
enjoyed
this
well
enough
and
it
had
been
years
since
i
had
had
one
d
a
malty
sweet
pine
spiced
beer
that
comes
across
and
very
seasonal
and
enjoyable
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
im
glad
that
i
came
upon
it
it
will
be
a
beer
that
i
look
foward
to
drinking
every
winter
d
from
this
review
one
might
thin
that
i
dont
love
hops
well
i
do
love
hops
in
fact
several
of
my
all
time
favorite
brews
are
dipas
and
ipas
its
just
that
well
sometimes
hops
just
arent
called
for
this
brew
has
some
nice
and
complex
fruitcake
cherry
and
cinnamon
notes
going
for
it
but
the
hops
come
in
and
decimate
any
delicate
wintery
flavors
that
i
noticed
in
the
nose
i
love
having
my
palate
destroyed
with
hop
power
but
not
when
im
trying
to
concentrate
on
the
wonderful
but
more
delicate
notes
that
cant
stand
up
to
the
almighty
hop
all
in
all
this
is
a
fine
brew
i
just
think
it
could
have
been
slightly
better
a
near
miss
of
top
tier
beer
imo
poured
into
straight
pint
glass
a
deep
brown
color
slightly
lighter
than
most
of
the
style
poured
with
a
thick
head
of
nice
tight
bubbles
head
was
a
pale
tan
color
with
minimal
lacing
welcoming
aroma
with
spice
and
caramel
notes
the
flavors
matches
the
aroma
very
well
with
a
smooth
caramel
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
body
was
thinner
than
usual
for
the
style
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
45
pint
session
would
happen
before
you
realized
it
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
if
you
see
it
get
it
a
nice
medium
body
makes
for
an
enjoyable
if
not
jawdropping
winter
warmer
i
enjoy
a
taste
or
two
every
winter
taste
is
thick
creamy
sour
malts
roasted
nuts
cinnamon
spice
caramel
a
touch
of
bakers
chocolate
way
in
the
back
and
some
hops
leaves
the
mouth
on
the
sticky
side
and
a
little
bitter
drinkability
is
good
in
spite
of
the
6
4abv
better
than
average
winter
warmer
notes
from
031208
d
very
nice
balance
makes
it
very
drinkable
no
of
the
flavors
and
smells
are
overdone
its
all
just
right
drinks
down
easily
which
makes
for
a
nice
addition
to
the
winter
beer
arsenal
pours
a
dark
amber
little
clarity
with
a
thick
two
finger
light
brown
head
aroma
is
pleasant
some
malt
but
a
light
hint
of
hops
smell
is
very
crisp
and
pleasant
taste
is
hoppy
with
malty
sweetness
good
balance
between
the
two
slight
hints
of
alcohol
not
a
light
of
spiciness
suprising
for
a
seasonal
brew
good
texture
with
a
light
body
good
beer
to
try
but
not
a
session
beer
a
little
heavy
and
sweet
for
multiple
units
taste
is
average
nothing
exciting
d
this
is
a
beer
with
big
flavor
but
still
it
is
smooth
and
drinks
rather
easily
i
recommend
this
one
drinkability
very
nice
a
well
rounded
ale
i
would
have
preferred
more
spice
to
make
it
more
memorable
but
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
one
of
my
usual
favorite
winter
warmers
not
quite
amazing
but
pretty
solid
spiced
without
being
overly
winterwarmerspiced
sweet
without
being
cloyingly
sugary
piney
without
being
pnw
ipa
bitter
a
nice
solid
blend
of
malt
sweet
fruit
and
spice
definitely
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
is
very
low
this
beer
started
out
looking
and
smelling
great
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
a
nice
warmer
on
my
hands
at
first
sip
it
all
went
devestatingly
wrong
theres
no
way
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
i
dont
even
think
ill
be
finishing
this
one
the
phenolicbooze
character
is
too
much
for
me
sad
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
actually
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
with
a
flavor
that
last
on
the
palate
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
winter
warmer
nothing
new
here
but
still
a
solid
offering
for
the
price
and
the
fact
its
from
the
pnw
make
it
enough
for
me
to
be
willing
to
throw
some
back
with
bob
cratchit
this
christmas
eve
d
this
is
pretty
good
very
different
from
most
winter
warmers
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
it
had
a
nice
full
body
with
a
slight
bite
medium
carbonation
overall
quite
light
for
the
style
id
like
a
little
more
heft
and
complexity
but
i
suppose
others
are
looking
for
something
lighter
whats
good
for
the
goose
as
they
say
jk
d
kind
of
regular
winter
warmer
nothing
really
stands
out
of
the
garden
variety
as
they
say
malty
aroma
with
mild
dried
cherry
buried
into
it
that
manifests
more
in
the
flavor
its
light
cherry
flavor
is
hinted
at
under
a
smooth
malty
rush
finishes
a
little
dry
with
the
barest
hint
of
hops
body
is
fairly
light
no
indication
of
alcohol
definitely
traditional
not
overly
sweet
or
spiced
at
all
a
nice
easy
drinker
for
a
cool
fall
night
the
drinkability
is
very
good
a
must
try
brew
prosit
mk
bought
this
in
bottle
back
in
december
06
fromthe
stadium
thrift
way
in
tacoma
and
just
now
drank
it
poured
a
reddish
brown
in
the
glass
almost
no
head
rich
malts
and
alcohol
with
subtle
pruneraisin
scents
the
taste
is
similar
but
transitions
to
noticable
citrus
hops
very
nice
warmer
a
real
delight
to
drink
was
good
nad
malty
with
some
age
on
it
on
the
palate
the
caramel
malt
do
modest
battle
with
background
hops
and
theres
a
few
miscellaneous
spices
in
the
mix
sometimes
cinnamon
maybe
ginger
and
yet
still
a
baked
cookie
malt
sweetness
in
between
rather
thin
bodied
too
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
its
got
that
thick
winter
warmer
feel
heavy
in
the
mouth
heavy
on
the
malt
still
has
the
unusual
fruit
factor
exotic
and
tropicalfresh
then
we
have
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
dark
roast
to
the
malt
bitter
espresso
bean
sticky
caramel
molasses
sweet
side
bit
of
hop
bitterness
well
i
thought
i
had
finished
with
all
the
winter
warmers
i
had
in
the
fridge
but
this
one
was
hiding
in
the
back
good
deal
im
in
the
mood
for
something
festive
as
its
been
a
blah
week
lets
see
here
it
pours
reddishbrown
a
onefinger
tan
head
fades
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
behind
smells
of
malts
light
chocolate
some
spice
and
a
bit
of
tea
tastes
malty
and
spicy
with
a
subtle
earthiness
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
to
medium
bodied
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
next
year
when
the
time
comes
pours
a
four
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
clear
deep
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation

that

its
still
just
good
not
great
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
medium
copper
forming
a
creamy
1
inch
tan
head
light
spots
of
lace
dot
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
rich
mix
of
malt
and
spices
the
taste
begins
with
a
smooth
malty
caramel
flavor
followed
by
a
light
mix
of
spices
and
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
nothing
too
complex
but
in
this
case
the
simplicity
works
out
well
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
a
medium
thickness
for
a
winter
warmer
the
medium
abv
and
full
flavor
make
for
a
highly
drinkable
brew
overall
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
beers
this
season
overall
this
went
down
ok
but
with
all
the
winter
warmers
out
there
id
seek
something
else
over
this
dark
ruby
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
nose
is
very
malty
with
some
spices
and
earthy
hops
taste
is
again
of
dark
sweet
malts
some
nice
fruits
and
candy
as
well
good
body
and
carbonation
for
the
style
a
little
overly
sweet
but
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
certainly
a
nice
winter
beer
not
the
best
for
me
but
good
hopefully
the
over
carbonation
of
my
batch
was
an
anomaly
d
this
beer
will
not
taste
very
good
to
the
average
beer
consumer
but
if
you
look
for
the
flavors
and
are
picky
this
is
a
great
beer
great
for
dessert
and
example
of
an
english
strong
or
a
black
pale
ale
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
into
a
sniffer
glass
this
pours
slightly
hazy
mahogany
with
a
very
small
topping
of
foam
the
nose
is
full
of
nice
toasty
malt
and
lots
of
resinous
hops
flavor
is
not
quite
as
interesting
though
a
bit
of
sweet
grainy
malt
and
bitterness
thats
very
low
compared
to
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
nose
a
little
subtle
spiciness
and
a
fruity
yeast
character
round
it
out
nicely
though
pours
a
clear
but
very
dark
ruby
with
a
light
tan
head
nose
is
light
with
a
hoppy
tone
flavor
is
smooth
slight
bitter
tone
strong
presence
of
hops
but
nowhere
near
overpowering
caramel
very
slight
nut
character
overall
a
decently
complex
flavor
ride
feel
is
good
not
overly
syrupy
like
a
lot
of
other
winter
warmers
tend
to
be
good
bubble
on
it
too
very
drinkable
someone
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
night
if
they
wanted
to
would
i
probably
not
its
good
but
it
just
doesnt
grab
me
as
others
have
drinkability
is
pretty
good
satisfying
and
quaffable
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
but
a
fine
regional
interpretation
will
probably
try
next
years
version
not
a
session
beer
for
me
pours
clear
medium
to
dark
brown
with
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
just
a
film
that
barely
covers
the
body
really
mild
aroma
is
more
malty
than
hoppy
with
a
slightly
leathery
nose
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
spice
nice
malty
if
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
and
hint
of
other
indistinguishable
spice
transitions
quickly
into
a
pleasantly
lingering
aftertaste
that
is
bitter
and
eventually
a
little
spicy
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
good
creamy
texture
and
a
softish
carbonation
that
makes
this
very
drinkable
i
consistenly
buy
at
least
a
sixer
of
this
every
holiday
season
partially
because
the
local
grocer
always
carries
it
it
is
not
as
strongly
flavored
as
some
of
the
other
holiday
beers
but
i
am
not
always
looking
for
that
goes
well
with
a
holiday
roast
or
any
of
the
dessert
pies
drinkability
while
not
the
most
remarkable
example
of
the
style
it
is
still
fairly
easydrinking
for
a
lighter
winter
warmer
the
ebenezer
ale
needs
something
though
it
is
stingy
not
much
of
anything
to
be
memorable
it
is
still
very
balanced
and
not
bad
in
any
way
bridgeport
is
a
pretty
good
brewery
their
esb
and
ipa
are
pretty
much
a
56
time
a
year
purchase
in
the
galt
household
ebenezer
though
there
are
better
pnw
holiday
beers
out
there
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
the
bridgeport
winter
seasonal
ebenezer
ale
at
the
local
grocery
store
poured
it
into
my
full
sail
shaker
pint
as
close
as
i
could
come
to
portland
and
found
a
deep
amber
slightly
hazy
brew
with
a
nice
thick
head
to
it
the
aroma
was
spicy
and
warm
with
a
slight
alcohol
to
the
nose
taste
was
bursting
with
maltiness
with
just
enough
bitter
and
sweet
to
make
this
a
perfect
winter
beer
if
it
wasnt
85
degrees
outside
i
would
have
been
in
total
bliss
but
had
to
settle
for
beer
enjoyment
this
isnt
as
complex
as
other
winter
warmers
but
it
sure
hit
the
spot
and
paired
well
with
my
dinner
this
also
increased
its
drinkability
as
i
finished
off
2
of
them
this
beer
had
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
soapy
head
atop
the
beer
smells
very
malty
and
tastes
malty
as
well
not
much
spice
going
on
in
this
beer
which
ups
the
drinkability
for
me
not
my
favorite
bridgeport
beer
but
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
i
look
forward
to
this
release
every
winter
served
from
a
bottle
on
a
cool
winter
evening
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
rusty
hue
very
thin
head
and
lacing
smell
has
both
hops
and
sweet
smells
very
strongly
taste
is
much
of
the
same
both
hoppy
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
strong
alcohol
taste
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
only
6
a
bit
sweet
perhaps
not
especially
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
interesting
it
isnt
quite
as
heavy
or
strong
as
most
winter
warmers
but
doesnt
really
fit
the
bill
of
a
casual
drinker
as
an
ipa
or
apa
that
said
it
is
a
good
beer
for
those
who
want
a
warmer
type
beer
without
the
determination
it
sometimes
takes
to
finish
a
stronger
barleywine
type
warmer
not
a
bad
beer
but
probably
wont
miss
it
during
the
offseason
the
ebenezer
comes
into
my
world
with
a
dark
black
reddish
hue
with
a
nice
foam
head
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
the
aroma
starts
off
malty
with
a
waft
of
spice
it
tastes
smooth
but
is
definitely
more
malty
dominated
with
a
biscuit
maltiness
to
it
it
is
slightly
chewy
in
the
mouth
and
is
an
overall
pretty
darn
good
beer
drinks
okay
just
not
much
going
here
as
winter
warmers
go
all
all
id
say
this
is
the
most
mediocre
winter
warmer
ive
ever
had
d
easy
to
drink
nothing
thats
going
to
wallop
you
which
in
most
instances
is
a
good
thing
to
have
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
my
next
one
reddish
brown
in
the
glass
almost
no
head
rich
malts
and
alcohol
with
subtle
pruneraisin
scents
the
taste
is
similar
but
transitions
to
noticable
citrus
hops
ebenezer
is
somewhat
easy
to
drink
not
alot
of
complexity
to
it
but
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
thank
you
andre
for
bringing
it
to
fake
thanksgiving
overall
a
very
nice
slow
sipper
with
some
unique
smells
and
flavors
pours
garnet
with
an
average
sized
head
that
leaves
webs
of
lacing
as
it
dissipates
the
aroma
primarily
consists
of
roasted
malts
and
spices
though
a
bit
of
hop
character
and
alcohol
shine
through
as
well
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
roastedcaramel
malts
dominate
while
the
hops
play
their
part
and
balance
things
out
by
providing
just
enough
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
enough
carbonation
to
lightly
prickle
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
each
year
this
beer
pours
a
deep
red
and
brown
color
with
a
nice
head
it
has
a
nice
spicy
sweet
smell
this
beer
has
sweet
malt
with
a
rich
spice
and
a
hop
back
it
has
a
clean
smooth
feel
with
a
nice
finish
this
beer
was
pretty
good
it
drank
easy
and
had
a
good
flavor
as
far
as
a
winter
beer
goes
its
not
the
best
ive
had
but
it
is
worth
drinking
if
you
have
the
chance
the
body
is
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
dwindled
down
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
lace
left
behind
after
each
drink
a
malty
caramel
aroma
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
slightly
sweet
taste
due
to
the
malt
some
hop
tingle
on
the
tongue
spices
and
a
tinge
of
alcohol
a
nice
balance
a
mediumbodied
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
i
can
handle
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
but
i
think
anymore
would
be
overkill
thanks
to
babydoc
for
sending
this
for
my
ba
annv
pours
with
a
sparkling
foamy
robust
head
aroma
is
crisp
delicate
yet
inviting
and
familiar
malty
with
the
slightest
piney
hint
color
was
a
deep
barely
translucent
mahogany
brown
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
but
smooth
with
ample
yet
delicate
carbonation
i
was
expecting
the
flavor
to
be
a
torrent
of
clichéd
malts
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
a
slowly
developing
medium
bodied
dry
flavor
with
mere
hints
of
roasted
malts
and
an
oakey
depth
a
nice
drinkable
seasonal
offering
from
bridgeport
in
portland
or
its
a
solid
beer
and
a
good
winter
warmer
overall
it
seems
to
be
a
nice
drinking
brew
not
overwhelming
but
not
spectacular
either
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
especially
on
a
cold
night
i
got
it
for
8
a
sixpack
and
it
may
be
overpriced
at
that
amount
ill
have
ebenezer
again
this
winter
for
sure
but
ill
look
for
it
on
sale
d
i
gotta
be
honest
here
the
smell
led
me
to
believe
this
was
going
to
be
special
but
the
taste
was
a
let
down
this
beer
is
very
conservative
notes
i
could
pull
back
a
few
of
these
without
thinking
of
a
change
of
pace
nice
warming
alcohol
afterwards
as
you
savor
the
last
sip
d
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
although
with
other
winter
warmers
out
now
i
doubt
i
would
do
so
worth
a
try
though
although
currently
its
hard
to
consider
it
winter
when
its
90
degrees
outside
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
great
amount
of
clarity
and
a
decent
head
and
retention
aroma
is
slight
fruity
malty
taste
is
refreshing
nothing
special
but
well
blended
and
balanced
i
think
i
pick
a
sweet
cherry
flavor
in
this
hops
are
none
to
speak
of
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
it
is
refreshing
and
nice
not
offensive
at
all
but
not
outstanding
pours
a
dark
garnet
with
a
finger
or
two
of
cappucino
froth
on
top
nose
is
a
striking
apricot
potpurri
and
peach
schnapps
taste
continues
with
the
schnapps
buttressed
by
christmas
cookie
spice
and
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
winter
warmer
but
welcome
on
a
hot
day
like
today
an
interesting
warmer
here
smells
delicious
tasted
pretty
good
not
overboard
on
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
like
most
in
the
style
perhaps
the
age
did
this
old
man
well
d
this
was
one
of
the
beers
in
a
winter
brews
10
pack
from
cost
plus
world
market
for
9
this
is
the
first
one
i
tried
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
rest
of
the
box
this
is
a
great
deal
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
but
could
have
been
better
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
and
dry
with
a
medium
body
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticed
and
has
no
warming
effect
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
as
a
winter
warmer
there
are
many
others
that
i
prefer
this
is
quite
good
ive
had
some
bad
luck
with
winter
beers
this
year
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
its
up
there
with
anchors
osa
pours
leaving
no
head
just
a
fine
ring
around
the
outside
dark
plum
in
color
the
aroma
is
very
faint
just
minor
hints
of
raspberry
fruit
nutty
hops
and
mild
alcohol
taste
also
has
a
low
potency
although
its
a
nice
mix
of
cherry
raspberry
caramel
and
other
sweet
malt
flavors
i
would
say
it
wasnt
very
spicy
as
you
might
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
hops
are
low
taste
is
fairly
dry
finish
is
kind
of
boring
carbonation
is
nice
but
its
a
bit
thinwatery
and
could
use
more
body
drinkability
is
average
i
would
expect
more
overall
flavor
from
this
style
of
beer
poured
into
an
imperial

smooth
with
nice
drinkability
as
well
very
approachable
for
the
sometimes
overdone
winter
warmer
style
body
is
barely
medium
but
smooth
and
creamy
making
it
a
pleasant
drinker
if
youre
looking
for
a
big
beefy
complex
winter
warmer
you
may
want
to
look
elsewhere
this
has
a
distinctly
mild

it

bridgeports
ebenezer
ale
is
something
of
a
scrooge
when
it
comes
to
ingredients

is
still
a
worthwhile
beer
if

of

look
elsewhere
if
youre
looking

of

then
ebenezer
is
your
man

like
this
beer

i
really
dont
find
spiced
beer
terribly
drinkable
thanks
to
brewbacca
for
the

interesting
flavor
combinations
that
i
enjoyed
even
though
it
is
a
bit
more
bitter
than
the
typical
winter
warmer
drinkability
was
actually
too
good
on
the
whole
winter
warmers
seem
like
sipping
beers
to
me
and
i
had
one
ebenezer
in
me
before
i
even
noticed
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
before
a
creamy
celery
flavour
is
joined
at
the
party
by
some
roasted
malt
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
banana
in
the
aftertaste
hops
are
apparent
but
never
dominant
although
they
do
seem
to
play
more
of
a
role
as
the
beer
warms
this
seems
like
a
less
potent
in

not

hoping
for
something
robust

its
quaffable
for
a

i
said
there
is
some

the

is
tasty
but
it
isnt
as
drinkable
as
many
others
are
good
session
beer
up
and
down
d
theres
just
not
enough
going
on
here
to
warrant
drinking
much
of
this
at
6
4
a
very
disappointing
seasonal
ale
poorly
brewed
and
poorly
fermented
blech
down
the
sink
it
goes
peeyoosa
this
beer
pours
a
nearly
garnet
reddish
brown
with
a
tan
twofinger
head
with
good
retention
and
wispy
lacing
the
smell
is
of
dark
heavy
citrus
with
a
caramelly
malted
undertow
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
explode
together
as
rich
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
intermingle
with
herbal
and
fruity
hop
tastes
the
finish
is
moderately
long
but
the
feel
is
very
carbonated
but
not
overly
so
and
creamy
this
beer
is
crisper
and
spicier
than
a
lot
of
other
winter
ales
and
i
havent
stopped
thinking
about
it
since
i
drank
it
smell
is
malty
with
spice
and
a
little
piney
hops
medium
body
with
a
very
dry
finish
some
alchohol
warming
is
noticable
taste
is
very
spicy
which
hides
much
of
the
malty
sweetness
not
bad
but
could
be
smoother
or
more
balanced
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
red
tint
to
it
the
head
is
tan
it
fades
slowly
leaving
very
few
laces
it
smells
slightly
fruity
it
also
has
a
slightly
spicy
aroma
there
is
not
much
to
the
aroma
i
think
the
only
thing
i
can
put
a
name
to
is
a
slight
grape
like
aroma
i
can
not
detect
any
hop
presence
it
has
a
nice
toasted
malt
taste
i
can
taste
grapes
slightly
as
with
the
arome
i
taste
no
hops
at
all
it
has
a
very
slight
cinnimon
taste
but
not
much
this
beer
is
sort
of
lacking
on
flavor
and
aroma
perhaps
some
more
hops
and
some
spices
would
help
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
it
is
carbonated
well
it
leaves
a
sweet
taste
on
my
palate
this
beer
would
make
a
good
session
beer
because
it
is
low
in
alcohol
and
the
flavor
is
very
non
aggressive
i
doubt
i
will
try
this
one
again
not
much
smell
to
this
one
when
i
finally
figured
out
what
i
thought
i
was
smelling
i
took
a
taste
and
realized
that
it
was
a
grapered
wine
smell
maybe
a
mulled
wine
this
one
didnt
taste
bad
and
would
be
a
good
warmer
but
i
did
feel
like
someone
had
taken
a
standard
beer
with
some
nice
maltiness
and
thrown
in
a
splash
of
wine
i
cant
think
of
too
often
that
i
would
want
that
i
usually
want
a
wine
or
a
beer
but
not
together
very
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
using
this
as
a
winter
warmer
did
the
trick
tonight
with
a
bit
of
chill
in
the
50
degree
air
more
drinkable
than
other
warmers
although
i
believe
aging
for
too
long
may
not
be
in
the
cards
mouthfeel
smooth
but
nothing
special
as
i
have
this
winter
warmer
in
midmarch
i
wonder
if
it
would
have
tasted
in
the
brutal
coldness
of
midjanuary
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
a
picture
of
scrooge
himself
on
it
maroonscarlet
body
with
a
12
of
foamy
tan
head
smell
is
slightly
cinnamon
and
giner
and
also
slightly
hoppy
taste
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
very
easy
to
drink
alcohol
and
plenty
of
different
spices
abound
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
appearing
almost
flat
but
does
offer
a
slight
tingle
when
swallowed
aftertaste
is
slightly
coffee
and
chocolate
but
the
spices
dominate
this
beer
good
sipping
but
not
overwhelming
i
thank
babydoc
for
the
sample
of
this
beer
thanks
babydoc
i
am
not
much
for
winter
beers
and
i
note
that
my
reviews
tend
to
be
rated
lower
for
these
styles
but
overall
this
is
a
decent
version
a
dark
mahogany
body
reveals
cherrystained
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
and
its
creamy
offwhite
head
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
nice
splashes
of
lace
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
some
vinous
and
cherrylike
notes
greet
you
in
the
nose
followed
by
a
waft
of
chocolate
and
caramel
overall
the
aroma
is
somewhat
restrained
but
whats
there
is
very
nice
in
the
mouth
its
mediumfull
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
moderate
natural
carbonation
the
flavor
not
unlike
the
aroma
is
somewhat
limited
as
well
the
notes
of
cherry
remain
theyre
not
sweet
but
still
cherrylike
and
the
delicate
cocoa
flavor
is
there
as
well
but
overall
its
very
restrained
some
alcohol
is
present
but
its
unobtrusive
and
some
leafy
hops
emerge
in
the
dry
finish
as
a
fan
of
englishstyle
beers
i
can
say
that
this
makes
a
decent
pint
but
id
imagine
most
american
beer
lovers
will
be
left
looking
for
more
this
beer
departs
the
bottle
a
deep
red
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
i
get
some
piney
and
citrus
hop
and
a
very
sweet
malty
core
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
actually
a
little
thin
very
fleeting
there
is
a
nice
sweet
malt
but
it
tastes
like
there
are
some
spices
in
there
that
im
not
too
keen
on
im
not
really
into
the
spiced
beers
all
that
much
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
but
something
about
it
makes
it
seem
thin
overall
a
hohum
beer
just
okay
as
far
as
the
nice
winter
beers
go
overall
impression
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
but
not
a
standout
in
any
category
but
if
you
like
a
well
crafted
stronger
than
average
ale
this
one
might
be
for
you
amber
right
on
the
edge
of
brown
with
a
decent
head
this
one
is
nicely
balanced
malt
flavor
comes
through
with
a
few
more
hops
than
you
would
find
in
marzen
or
similar
no
spices
or
other
fruit
flavors
did
i
notice
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
wish
i
had
been
guzzling
in
my
teenage
years
rather
than
bud
or
natty
ice
type
of
beer
you
can
drink
all
night
enjoy
the
taste
of
but
not
feel
too
bad
about
missing
the
the
intricacies
of
the
flavor
once
you
get
smashed
drinkability
have
had
many
better
winter
beers
than
this
one
although
its
still
worth
a
try
just
a
bit
boring
to
me
pos
on
6
pack
says
it
is
formidable
enough
to
temper
even
the
crankiest
of
spirits
well
it
worked
for
me
i
was
in
a
bad
mood
and
now
im
not
lol
on
first
taste
i
thought
it
was
too
bitter
too
soon
too
harsh
needs
to
be
smooth
for
the
introduction
the
overall
taste
was
good
though
its
a
little
smokey
fruity
and
malty
all
at
once
and
is
a
good
warmer
a
pinch
of
added
spice
from
the
hops
makes
this
a
choice
beer
as
a
winter
warmer
still
ebenezer
is
a
worthy
brew
and
holds
together
quite
well
as
a
strong
bitter
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
one
that
gives
samuel
smiths
and
anchor
steams
seasonals
a
solid
run
for
their
money
im
tempted
to
save
the
last
bottle
and
see
what
a
year
of
bottle
conditioning
might
do
to
the
flavor
snap
it
up
if
you
can
find
it
this
winter
dark
with
ruby
red
highlights
big
head
leaning
toward
tan
smells
like
hops
followed
by
some
sort
of
spice
this
is
loaded
with
hop
flavor
backed
with
a
tartness
that
is
unfamiliar
i
like
it
though
i
had
earlier
commented
to
friend
that
this
beer
wasnt
that
good
but
now
that
ive
made
it
through
half
the
six
pack
i
have
come
to
like
it
pleasant
this
ale
hit
the
spot
picked
this
up
at
trader
joes
and
wish
i
would
have
got
more
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
a
dark
choclolate
mocha
head
that
lasted
the
whole
time
drinking
the
smell
is
that
of
roasted
wood
and
malts
very
different
but
good
the
taste
is
of
citrus
and
dark
roasted
malts
maybe
cider
tasting
in
this
as
well
the
hops
are
strong
but
not
to
strong
very
good
for
an
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fruity
but
has
density
i
could
drink
alot
of
these
very
good
beer
thanks
genaro
ebeneezer
ale
2003
the
color
was
dark
ambergold
it
had
a
shortlived
head
with
very
little
lace
the
aroma
was
fragrant
and
citrusy
grapefruity
with
caramel
tones
the
taste
was
composed
of
sweet
caramel
citrus
and
hints
of
roasted
coffee
it
had
a
bit
of
oily
mouthfeel
with
a
good
hop
bite
the
finish
was
dry
citrusy
slightly
sweet
and
noticably
astringent
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
an
exciting
one
a
minor
point
was
the
rather
sombercolored
victorianesque
label
which
i
think
needed
some
bright
seasonal
colors
this
is
a
nice
brew
and
if
it
were
a
little
thicker
i
would
really
enjoy
it
on
a
cold
winters
nite
like
tonite
a
holiday
beer
exchange
request
on
my
part
sought
out
and
found
by
mrpicklerelish
many
thanks
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
large
soft
fluffy
off
white
head
web
like
lace
very
nice
the
aroma
was
fruity
cranberry
yet
a
hint
of
sweet
perhaps
from
the
spiced
malt
the
spice
carried
over
in
the
taste
but
not
to
strong
while
other
flavors
of
caramel
and
raisin
are
balanced
nice
by
an
alcohol
backed
hop
the
alcohol
is
soothing
not
harsh
making
this
a
soft
and
mellow
easy
drinker
if
you
like
spiced
beers
the
mouth
is
left
alittle
dry
while
alittle
hop
lingers
thisone
makes
a
nice

warmer
kev
drinkability

this
went
down
well
enough
but
it
simply
cant
keep
pace
with
the
many
other
good
examples
found
in
this
category
pours
a
dark
maroon
with
brown
highlights
virtually
no
head
but
nice
carbonation
and
great
lace
aroma
is
sweet
depp
heavy
malt
with
molasses
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
dry
alocoholic
biscuity
middle
with
some
pronounced
spicy
bitterness
on
the
back
end
this
is
a
mildly
rich
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
fine
holiday
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
at
first
taste
but
it
quickly
grew
on
me
and
i
was
amazed
at
how
easily
drinkable
it
became
a
nice
after
dinner
relaxer
the
ebeneezer
ale
poured
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
good
light
tan
head
made
up
of
medium
sized
bubbles
that
quickly
went
down
to
a
thin
layer
it
has
a
nice
complex
aroma
of
malts
spices
with
some
fruitiness
and
alcohol
the
initial
taste
is
malts
with
some
sweet
yet
tart
fruitiness
it
has
a
nice
hop
finish
with
a
kind
of
mediciney
aftertaste
the
tastes
mellowed
out
and
balanced
better
as
i
drank
more
and
it
warmed
up
big
thanks
to
gusler
for
providing
a
very
clear
amber
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
otherwise
it
is
brown
with
a
tan
head
aroma
notes
of
raisin
rum
perhaps
some
cherry
definitely
malty
and
an
ale
lightly
sweet
in
the
front
there
are
notes
and
hints
of
chocolate
raisins
and
other
dark
fruits
a
bit
over
carbonated
for
a
beer
that
should
be
served
at
cellar
temperatures
though
a
quick
swirling
of
my
glass
takes
care
of
this
deficiency
a
smooth
cream
soda
type
of
feel
taste
to
this
beer
evokes
memories
of
vanilla
curiously
this
bottle
conditioned
ale
has
the
least
amount
of
sediment
barely
a
faint
ring
at
the
bottom
i
have
ever
seen
in
a
bottle
conditioned
real
ale
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
be
sipping
on
a
cold
fall
night
a
dark
ruby
ambertinted
beer
the
aroma
and
first
sip
are
very
herbal
with
some
light
spiciness
and
a
sprucey
hop
bitterness
malts
slowly
assert
themselves
to
be
sweet
toffeeish
and
dominant
im
not
sure
what
if
any
spices
were
used
here
but
there
does
seem
to
be
an
overwhelming
herbalness
this
may
be
solely
from
the
hops
over
time
the
malts
stretch
themselves
out
and
really
carry
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
decidedly
unsticky
which
is
welcome
for
such
a
sweet
malty
beer
i
didnt
particularly
like
it
at
first
but
over
the
course
of
the
pint
it
really
sank
its
claws
into
me
and
at
the
end
i
wanted
another
this
may
be
due
to
its
excellent
aftertaste
poured
a
clear
deep
red
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
blend
of
fruity
esters
and
spicy
hops
the
taste
is
rich
with
a
sweet
carmel
malt
background
and
a
bitter
finish
a
little
higher
gravity
makes
this
a
great
beer
to
have
during
the
winter
bottle
purchased
at
jims
homebrew
in
spokane
for
1
09
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
modest
head
that
didnt
hang
around
for
more
than
a
couple
of
minutes
fairly
complex
perfumy
aroma
with
sweet
malts
and
elements
of
tropical
fruits
cinnamon
and
pepper
taste
starts
out
with
sweet
fruity
malt
flavor
along
with
a
peppery
zing
ending
with
a
well
balanced
dry
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
was
average
neither
thick
nor
thin
not
a
bad
thing
to
sip
on
a
cold
november
day
as
i
watch
the
seahawks
batter
the
lions
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
a
multi
tiered
malt
profile
and
enough
hops
make
this
a
slightly
different
brew
on
the
pour
the
beer
appears
a
deep
amber
color
with
the
head
purposeful
in
size
and
frothy
in
texture
the
left
over
lace
is
a
fine
sheet
to
coat
the
glass
big
malt
nose
caramel
crisp
and
clean
with
a
sweet
start
top
is
moderate
in
feel
the
finish
pertinently
carbonated
provocatively
hopped
with
a
dry
aftertaste
nice
creamy
thick
mouthfeel
that
i
love
in
this
style
of
beer
the
carbonation
helps
to
cut
the
rich
mouthfeel
and
adds
to
the
drinkability
a
nice
beer
certainly
worth
trying
quite
drinkable
tonight
theres
a
wee
bit
of
chill
in
the
air
and
this
goes
down
well
dark

color
medium

aroma
is

mild
tasting
ale
mild
malts
and
slightly
spicy
although
its
more
fruity
than
malty
kind
of
an
average
and
mild
tasting
beer
as
winter
warmers
go
there
is
a
slightly
metallic
taste
mouthfeel

i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
this
beer
is
hazy
copper
colored
w
virtually
no
head
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
taste
up
front
w
a
clean
finish
in
the
nose
i
can
get
a
hint
of
molasses
thanks
for
this
one
beerguy101
it
pours
a
mediumdark
brown
body
with
a
small
cream
head
the
aroma
is
lemon
and
the
smell
of
tomato
plants
during
picking
or
tobacco
as
for
taste
there
isnt
much
theres
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
slightly
sour
at
the
end
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
off
white
foam
with
a
nice
lace
the
smell
was
of
malty
grains
and
hops
with
a
hint
of
mountain
pine
the
taste
was
also
pleasant
with
malty
grains
hops
and
a
hint
of
spices
and
a
touch
of
citrus
the
sweet
bitterness
is
well
balanced
on
the
palate
a
rich
and
sweet
tasting
ale
that
delivers
hints
of
toffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
spiciness
i
enjoyed
this
both
as
an
afternoon
warming
drink
as
well
as
an
after
dinner
teaser
to
go
along
with
some
left
over
xmas
cake
a
double
duty
brew
thats
worth
taking
a
closer
look
at
when
the
opportunity
arises
many
thinks
to
my
roomy
and
the
person
that
did
the
beer
exchange
otherwise
i
may
never
have
tasted
this
beer
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hops
pours
amber
in
color
with
a
small
head
the
mouthfeel
is
so
mellow
and
smooth
and
a
bit
dry
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
for
a
higher
alcohol
beer
i
do
get
that
warming
feeling
in
the
end
as
well
deep
dark

it

quite
well
done
its
gusher
and
lemony
taste
are
distinctive
for
the
style
definite
spices
on
this
one
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
i
began
to
get
foam
coming
up
through
the
neck
this
precipitated
the
pour
but
negated
anything
more
than
gentility
i
was
getting
loads
of
foam
as
the
result
and
it
quickly
became
obvious
that
this
one
was
going
to
be
timeconsuming
pour
wait
pour
wait
no
problem
since
the
french
vanillacolored
head
looked
like
the
top
of
an
ice
cream
cone
plus
i
can
always
open
something
else
in
the
interim
the
density
and
retention
of
the
head
was
almost
worth
the
price
of
admission
in
and
of
itself
the
nose
was
quite
strong
especially
of
cinnamon
but
also
perhaps
nutmeg
and
the
honey
lent
a
dull
not
cloying
sweetness
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
goldenyellow
srm

the
lacing
that
began
to
form
in
the
interim
was
beautifully
sticky
the
taste
was
a
bit
sharp
for
my
liking
as
if
they
might
have
used
too
heavy
a
hand
in
the
addition
of
the
spices
cinnamon
was
quite
evident
to
the
point
of
being
overwhelming
finish
was
dry
very
spicy
and
really
more
than
i
would
want
at
any
time
of
year
clear
medium
amber
pour
with
a
slight
red
hue
nose
is
of
clove
mostly
with
hints
of
nutmeg
cardamom
and
cinnamon
almost
a
light
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
nice
balanced
blend
of
spice
flavor
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
on
the
forefront
cardamom
in
the
middle
and
with
clove
dominating
the
end
clean
finish
with
a
bitter
clove
aftertaste
a
bit
of
sweetness
would
improve
the
balance
and
contrast
the
spice
still
this
one
is
outstanding
some
winter
beers
you
have
one
and
then
its
off
to
sleep
this
one
youd
happily
have
a
second
rjt
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
full
of
spices
cinnamon
coming
through
strong
taste
is
lighter
than
the
smell
some
spices
malts
a
touch
of
honey
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
not
spectacular
is
a
solid
beer
as
a
winter
warmer
this
falls
short
of
my
expectations
for
the
style
thin
head
with
very
little
lacing
smells
nice
and
spicy
reminiscent
of
red
cinnamon
heart
candy
just
out
of
the
fridge
this
tastes
like
a
summertime
beer
with
some
cinnamon
and
a
bit
of
nutmeg
thrown
into
the
pot
for
good
measure
the
abv
is
not
evident
here
the
flavor
is
tart
like
a
lemon
zest
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
sprinkled
with
cinnamon
in
the
front
sides
and
middle
not
at
all
the
characteristics
of
warmers
in
my
memory
as
it
warms
the
flavors
and
aroma
remain
the
same
but
fuller
and
rounder
than
before
five
minutes
after
the
last
sip
i
feel
like
i
sucked
on
too
many
lemon
balls
and
my
breath
is
fresh
interesting
yes
but
just
kind
of
odd
this
beer
pours
up
a
medium
cloudy
amber
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
some
retention
and
plenty
of
spotty
lacing
left
behind
smell
is
cinnamon
honey
and
yeast
taste
is
very
dry
with
a
kind
of
spicy
finish
and
a
yeasty
taste
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
unappealing
not
horrible
but
not
my
type
of
beer
either
tastecoriander
orange
honey
faint
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
as
it
warms
refreshing
and
easydrinking
for
a
winter
warmer
would
go
nicely
on
a
mild
south
carolina
winter
day
worth
a
try
o
not
a
bad
beer
will
have
again
this
is
a
decent
brew
if
there
was
a
hint
of
pumpkin
here
it
would
make
an
excellent
beer
there
pie
spices
and
crustlike
bready
notes
are
pretty
damn
good
i
really
liked
this
beer
for
its
drinkability
and
its
spice
character
a
few
of
these
will
definitely
warm
you
up
in
the
late
autumn
poured
a
hazy
goldenamber
color
with
noticeable
carbonation
and
a
moderate
head
that
left
little
lacing
first
smell
is
grain
mixed
with
a
healthy
dose
of
spices
that
are
more
common
in
fall
seasonalpumpkin
beers
still
a
nice
smell
just
more
pronounced
than
i
expected
taste
brings
more
of
the
same
spice
plus
a
little
hop
bite
and
a
touch
of
citrus
sweetness
very
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
though
the
mouthfeel
in
this
one
was
interesting
overall
id
say
mediumbodied
but
it
had
a
bit
of
grittiness
to
it
that
added
some
heft
this
beer
like
a
lot
of
the
rj
rockers
offerings
went
done
very
easily
the
combination
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
and
overall
balance
makes
these
beers
very
smooth
aside
from
the
really
tall
head
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
d
not
bad
after
seeing
the
ridiculous
level
of
carbonation
i
was
afraid
that
it
was
infected
but
it
turned
out
to
be
clean
the
spices
are
relatively
well
done
but
it
isnt
anything
special
overall
definitely
a
nice
beer
for
the
season
this
one
tasted
decent
even
after
9
months
of
storage
the
base
beer
cant
really
be
commented
on
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
spicy
qualities
present
throughout
both
the
nose
and
the
flavoring
there
was
such
an
array
of
spicy
inclusions
making
this
nice
and
inviting
for
a
cozy
drink
on
a
cool
day
during
the
summer
however
it
is
a
bit
much
and
we
were
bogged
down
by
the
heaviness
at
times
o
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
compared
to
others
in
the
styles
although
it
doesnt
have
enough
alcohol
to
produce
warming
sensations
in
your
mouth
the
body
is
strong
enough
to
keep
you
warm
on
a
chilly
fall
night
ono
complaints
about
this
one
especially
for
free
overall
a
very
interesting
spin
on
your
typical
dark
thick
bodied
winter
warmer
would
love
to
try
this
again
fresh
to
see
if
the
spices
are
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
murky
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
eggshellwhite
head
the
retention
of
the
thin
collar
was
not
bad
and
the
lacing
in
broken
streaks
the
aroma
had
a
strong
note
of
cloves
along
with
sweetbreads
caramel
malt
nutmeg
and
a
little
cinnamon
the
flavors
were
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
an
emphasis
on
the
cloves
and
caramel
malt
plus
the
addition
of
a
bitter
slightly
woody
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
slick
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
a
bit
prickly
a
nice
example
of
a
winter
warmer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
are
the
type
who
enjoys
spiced
beers
o
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
ale
unlike
many
other
brews
of
the
same
style
the
spices
are
very
balanced
and
not
so
in
your
face
definitely
there
just
not
overpowering
solid
brew
very
good
makes
me
even
more
homesick
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
winter
warmer
could
use
maybe
a
bit
more
heat
but
does
fine
as
it
is
would
have
liked
to
see
a
bit
more
character
in
the
spices
really
not
a
bad
little
beer
though
this
beer
is
a
golden
liquid
slightly
hazy
with
notable
yeast
floaties
slim
white
head
its
not
an
brilliantly
attractive
beer
average
the
aroma
is
nice
spice
is
the
first
thing
thats
noticeable
cinnamon
theres
a
little
nutmeg
pale
malt
and
earthy
hops
its
a
christmas
smell
for
a
winter
brew
appropriate
the
taste
is
middleoftheroad
theres
a
decent
balance
semisweet
the
spice
is
notable
in
the
taste
and
gives
a
peppery
sensation
on
the
tongue
hops
have
a
midtaste
bite
that
give
a
counterbalance
to
the
malt
not
bad
firm
in
body
but
not
quite
as
hefty
as
the
beer
needed
all
in
all
this
is
drinkable
and
good
but
not
very
interesting
and
really
rather
ordinary
for
the
season
o
while
this
beer
is
drinkable
it
is
wildly
uneven
it
has
some
good
qualities
and
some
mediocre
ones
o
not
too
shabby
really
quenched
my
thirst
and
was
a
nice
beer
to
drink
while
watching
national
lampoons
christmas
vacation
cloudy
orange
beer
with
a
rapidlt
fading
head
aroma
is
spicessmeels
like
those
spice
wafer
cookies
taste
is
the
same
holiday
spices
that
you
would
find
in
an
egg
nog
overall
an
average
beer
nothing
less
nothing
more
i
doubt
i
would
recommend
or
purchase
again
cloudy
yellowish
orange
in
appearance
with
a
finger
of
head
that
has
little
retention
the
nose
is
clearly
xmas
spices
and
the
taste
is
quite
spicy
as
well
cinnamon
takes
the
lead
here
there
is
a
pleasantly
dry
finish
but
it
is
a
bit
thin
an
interesting
brew
but
maybe
overall
too
light
for
a
winter
beer
o
looks
and
smells
great
but
i
thought
the
malt
should
pop
more
in
the
flavor
and
the
body
was
a
bit
too
light
for
a
winter
warmer
i
liked
the
summit
winter
ale
better
best
part
was
the
smell
poured
with
a
small
to
medium
sized
fine
off
white
that
settled
down
to
a
ring
after
a
bit
and
no
lace
color
is
a
hazy
pumpkin
pie
amber
which
is
a
nice
coincidence
the
same
spices
used
to
brew
with
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
mainly
those
spices
beer
and
later
a
little
funk
flavor
is
likewise
but
without
much
malt
to
balance
which
also
proly
leads
to
my
view
that
the
body
is
a
bit
light
too
although
good
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
average
length
for
a
spice
beer
im
not
finishing
mine
wish
i
had
some
cheese
or
something
to
neutralize
my
mouth
o
this
beer
was
nothing
special
but
a
nice
one
time
beer
the
abv
doesnt
show
at
all
which
i
liked
a
little
spiced
forward
which
i
thought
could
be
tones
down
a
little
overall
i
would
try
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
d
not
a
session
beer
but
you
could
have
more
than
one
before
the
flavor
wears
you
down
o
a
good
taste
for
the
season
but
i
doubt
i
will
search
for
it
again
d
top
to
bottom
this
may
be
the
winter
warmer
ive
had
to
date
a
really
splendid
beer
d
this
very
good
but
not
what
i
expected
with
the
name
first
snow
ale
because
it
is
quite
light
and
citrusy
for
the
style
d
usually
i
dont
like
spiced
beer
much
and
wouldnt
have
bought
this
had
i
read
the
label
closer
but
in
the
end
im
glad
i
did
as
this
brew
kept
the
spice
in
check
and
matched
this
subtler
spice
profile
with
a
light
bodied
ale
a
little
more
attention
to
the
malt
bill
and
this
brew
could
be
a
real
winter
staple
pours
a
rich
dark
amber
with
not
much
head
that
disappears
fast
the
is
spicy
the
taste
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
in
my
mind
a
little
strange
in
the
mix
luckily
the
body
and
mouthfeel
are
good
but
while
i
was
okay
with
drinking
one
i
switched
after
im
not
quite
sure
what
they
were
shooting
for
but
maybe
its
just
not
for
everyone
it
seems
most
of
the
people
are
split
on
this
one
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
pours
cloudy
amber
and
short
bubbly
white
head
that
gathers
around
the
edges
on
the
glass
aroma
is
very
spicy
lots
of
cinnamon
ginger
and
clove
along
with
caramel
and
sweet
malts
taste
is
gingerbread
cookies
caramel
cinnamon
toast
and
sweet
malts
bit
of
nuttiness
and
dried
fruit
notes
coming
through
as
well
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
with
more
strong
spices
cinnamon
and
ginger
mostly
caramel
light
nutty
flavors
and
sweet
malts
dried
dark
fruit
as
well
very
good
winter
beer
a
sleeper
out
of
the
bunch
i
was
evaluating
for
my
winterchristmas
beer
review
wow
very
nice
winter
brew
here
this
is
like
gingerbread
cookies
in
a
glass
and
isnt
overly
spiced
like
some
others
are
one
reviewer
mentioned
candy
cane
aromas
and
im
getting
them
too
lots
of
gingerbread
spices
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
and
the
like
toasted
malts
with
lots
of
sweetness
im
digging
this
quite
a
bit
one
of
the
better
winter
brews
i
had
this
year
its
not
terrible
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
given
to
me
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
purchasing
it
again
i
was
a
little
disappointed
because
i
do
like
rj
rockers
served
from
tap
into
a
dogfish
head
shaker
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
bone
white
head
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
cinnamon
corriander
cloves
and
candy
cane
yes
candy
cane
the
flavor
was
of
malt
cloves
corriander
cinnamon
and
a
slight
banana
note
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
quite
a
nice
brew
given
that
it
was
a
winter
brew
and
i
had
it
in
the
early
fall
really
says
something
about
this
one
i
am
still
in
shock
even
after
the
next
day
that
i
got
candy
cane
on
the
nose
this
is
definitely
a
nice
and
smooth
drinking
beer
with
no
harsh
flavors
anywhere
in
sight
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
this
in
the
coming
winter
months
for
sure
this
is
a
definite
must
try
on
tap
one
of
these
is
plenty
even
at
6
that
peppery
finish
brings
it
down
a
tad
i
first
sampled
this
at
columbias
world
beer
festival
and
have
since
had
it
several
times
overall
a
nice
and
drinkable
winter
warmer
with
quite
an
appealing
spice
mix
in
the
aroma
the
honeyish
notes
must
indeed
stem
from
the
use
of
honey
in
the
brewing
which
is
indicated
on
the
label
a
nice
interpretation
for
the
style
not
the
best
out
there
but
definitely
a
goto
choice
when
its
available
my
favorite
winter
ale
the
first
snow
ale
is
an
americanstyle
pale
ale
moderately
hopped
it
also
happens
to
have
15
pounds
of
honey
and
almost
every
spice
in
the
cabinet
thrown
in
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
orange
peel
and
allspice
nice
with
the
6
alcohol
makes
it
even
better
pours
a
rich
somewhat
hazy
pale
amber
with
barely
half
a
finger
of
white
head
that
disappears
to
the
edges
quickly
the
nose
teems
with
sweet
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
clove
an
undercurrent
of
hoppy
bananas
is
also
detectable
its
as
though
a
pale
ale
were
crossed
with
a
rich
apple
cider
in
a
good
way
believe
me
the
taste
doesnt
quite
follow
this
formula
though
with
the
spices
taking
a
distinct
back
seat
to
the
hoppy
pale
ale
flavors
though
they
are
still
there
the
banana
is
forced
into
a
sideshow
something
only
appearing
and
seemingly
appealing
only
to
those
looking
for
such
a
thrill
luckily
the
body
is
quite
moderate
allowing
this
warmer
to
maintain
the
drinkability
established
by
its
nose
the
aroma
here
is
pure
spice
but
from
the
aroma
i
cant
tell
if
its
a
winter
ale
or
a
pumpkin
beer
the
taste
is
closer
to
what
i
expect
from
a
spiced
winter
ale
but
theres
still
an
awful
lot
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
nutmeg
or
allspice
in
here
its
a
perfectly
good
perfectly
forgettable
winter
ale
son
of
a
peach
was
better
but
im
interested
in
this
brewery
d
really
a
very
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
the
flavors
tend
to
pile
up
in
beers
like
this
and
they
become
overpowering
if
you
have
another
one
but
hey
if
you
see
this
around
pick
some
up
its
definitely
worth
a
try
and
as
far
as
winter
brews
go
its
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
darkish
amber
with
an
average
head
aroma
is
strong
and
spicy
as
well
as
somewhat
malty
spice
is
mainly
cinnamon
and
cloves
flavor
is
fairly
strong
and
malty
and
the
spicy
component
is
mainly
cloves
and
cinnamon
there
is
also
just
a
hint
of
hops
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
tingly
and
nips
at
the
tongue
worth
trying
but
i
disagree
with
the
label
that
suggests
you
chill
the
mug
or
glass
before
drinking
this
was
best
after
it
warmed
a
touch
and
the
malt
was
able
to
balance
the
spices
a
little
bit
more
medium
body
and
a
decent
smooth
moutfeel
i
have
not
had
this
fresh
but
it
does
not
seem
to
be
any
worse
for
wear
at
this
point
another
solid
production
from
rj
rockers
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
fair
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
smells
quite
sweet
and
somewhat
spicy
with
nutmeg
mace
and
cinammon
as
well
as
perhaps
a
bit
of
clove
and
orange
peel
the
taste
is
still
a
little
sweet
but
not
as
much
so
as
the
nose
would
have
you
believe
it
is
going
to
be
there
is
a
nuttiness
and
a
creaminess
here
as
well
that
goes
pretty
well
with
the
sweetness
and
the
spice
pretty
clean
and
a
little
light
not
thick
or
heavy
at
all
and
thus
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
not
bad
at
all
a
lighter
interpretation
of
a
winterspiced
beer
with
a
nice
nuttiness
that
almost
reminds
me
of
pralines
a
spiced
pale
ale
thats
perfect
for
the
holidays
light
copper
color
with
a
medium
body
good
amount
of
head
after
the
pour
about
an
inch
and
slowly
thins
out
the
aroma
is
huge
in
this
one
full
of
cinnamon
and
clove
the
flavors
that
really
come
out
are
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
clove
at
6
abv
this
is
not
advised
as
a
session
beer
very
nicely
balanced
though
a
nicely
done
seasonal
overall
dumbfounded
by
the
past
couple
ratings
looking
forward
to
having
it
more
often
next
winter
this
is
my
first
beer
from
rjs
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
overall
it
wasnt
too
bad
granted
it
wasnt
great
either
it
had
a
very
light
spice
to
the
smell
but
the
spice
taste
was
more
up
front
in
the
taste
to
me
it
kind
of
tasted
like
a
light
pumpkin
beer
i
do
look
forward
to
try
other
brews
offered
from
rjs
colors
nice
and
promising
but
the
enjoyment
takes
a
dive
from
there
i
get
a
light
carbonation
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
the
bodys
okay
light
i
think
but
the
flavors
all
nutmeg
maybe
a
little
cinnamon
at
least
the
alcohol
is
working
another
rockers
brew
im
mostly
disappointed
by
a
a
medium
gold
with
a
reddish
hue
a
ring
of
foam
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
3
50
s
lots
of
spice
a
fragance
that
can
only
be
cinnamon
a
hint
of
green
wood
4

t
loads
of
grain
on
the
front
some
mild
hop
bite
on
the
back
less
pronounced
spice
on
the
palate
than
the
nose
mildly
nutty
and
with
a
hint
of
toastiness

d
some

touches
to
a

ale
not
a
standout
but
a
solid
beer
3
50
m
d
a
little
light
id
like
some
more
body
but
its
not
too
bad
at
all
drinks
smooth
and
easy
a
nice
seasonal
offering
and
something
id
be
interested
in
trying
again
good
balance
for
this
spiced
winter
warmer
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
i
dig
that
i
find
with
spiced
beers
if
they
are
too
clean
the
spicing
immediately
takes
over
not
the
case
here
give
this
one
a
go
drinkability
after
getting
passed
my
expectations
for
the
beer
i
rather
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
more
definitely
fits
the
category
of
a
winter
ale
drinkability
nice
array
of
spices
set
against
a
lighter
more
drinkable
pale
ale
did
r
j
rockers
brew
up
a
pleasant
winter
beer
yes
yes
they
did
i
could
drink
many
of
these
had
this
on
tap
at
sonnys
in
spartanburg
tonight
poured
a
pale
amber
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
was
full
of
spices
and
grain
as
was
the
taste
no
real
hops
to
it
very
earthy
grainy
flavor
almost
gritty
had
some
suprising
fruit
undertomes
to
it
went
down
very
easy
and
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
more
of
these
this
was
my
first
offering
from
rj
rockers
but
i
will
be
trying
more
pint
at
cws
in
columbia
sc
over
all
its
flavorful
and
drinkable
i
deducted
a
half
a
point
in
the
drinkability
because
of
the
spiciness
after
a
couple
i
would
want
to
move
on
to
something
else
this
beer
is
a
winter
warmer
no
matter
what
the
listed
style
is
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
there
was
a
nice
head
the
smell
was
of
spices
and
reminded
me
of
a
cold
winter
day
beside
the
fire
ths
taste
was
spiced
cinnamon
was
dominate
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
there
was
no
harshness
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
will
be
sure
to
have
again
sometime
this
comes
a
light
pale
yellowgoldish
color
with
a
thin
cap
off
tap
sparkles
a
little
and
the
cap
dissipates
to
some
lacings
smell
is
very
spicy
right
off
you
can
smell
cloves
cardamom
and
some
hops
smells
very
clean
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
initially
sweet
then
the
spices
smack
your
tongue
around
like
a
speed
bag
and
the
hops
follow
to
lock
it
all
in
i
had
a
belgian
buddy
have
a
pint
with
me
and
this
was
way
above
the
level
of
taste
he
was
used
to
mouth
feel
was
medium
with
a
little
carbonation
its
spiciness
really
leaves
you
wondering
what
just
happened
but
hops
brings
it
all
together
nicely
this
is
definitely
a
winter
beer
full
of
flavor
and
warmth
i
hope
they
bring
this
back
next
year
fairly
bitter
well
balanced
very
good
body
a
nice
beer
and
a
perfect
accompaniment
for
the
first
snow
in
sc
which
may
be
three
years
from
now
this
is
pretty
good
a
nice
subtle
version
of
the
style
sweet
hoppy
toasted
flavors
are
balanced
off
one
another
pretty
well
the
only
thing
that
really
surprises
me
is
the
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
although
i
am
at
a
loss
for
words
in
describing
it
its
something
id
have
again
its
very
fruity
and
earthy
a
nice
belgian
dark
ale
overall
this
is
a
nice
balanced
beer
that
doesnt
go
overboard
in
any
direction
but
still
lets
you
know
it
is
well
made
unlike
some
spiced
winter
warmers
the
spices
are
an
integral
part
of
the
flavor
rather
than
something
that
dominates
it
that
said
however
if
i
were
going
to
stock
up
on
a
winter
warmer
i
think
id
still
give
the
lancaster
brewing
winter
warmer
the
nod
in
preference
to
this
one
if
only
because
i
like
the
way
lancaster
brewing
have
used
both
british
and
american
hops
and
because
of
the
the
greater
warmth
from
the
higher
abv
summit
porter
is
better
i
am
watching
the
inaugural
college
bowl
championship
game
tonight
in
the
grip
of
a
winter
day
the
tab
fought
me
briefly
but
the
crack
was
deafening
i
got
a
light
spritz
as
a
result
and
now
my
curiosity
was
piqued
to
canduct
an
inverted
glug
the
pseudocascade
came
up
pretty
quickly
requiring
that
i
back
off
but
not
before
the
formation
of
three
fingers
of
dense

with

for
many
years
alongside
of
the
epa

first

so
this

but
at
this
tasting
im
not
getting
any
sweetness
at
all
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
but
its
great
with
some
age
on
it
the
spices
have
probably
dwindled
which
suits
my
palate
well
the
tart
note
is
slightly
overwhelming
but
this
is
a
good
brew
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
lots
of
ring
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip

was
left
in
the
bottom
of

after
the
pour
the
aroma
is
of
roasted

cocoa
caramel
and
some
spice
the
taste
even
has
more
going
on
with
a
slight
nutty
finish
very
smooth
to
drink
with
low

very
tasty
brew
really
liked
this
one
medium

soft

somewhat
creamy
as
an
on

offering
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
nice
on

will
have
to
pick
up
some
bottles
of
this
but
i
really
didnt
dig
it
too
much
better
and
worse
than
i
thought
tastes
great
but
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
off
looks
gorgeous

no

i
sense
from

this
is
all
the

taste
is
a
bit
mellowed
down
from
the
smell
except
there
is
a
tiny
hop
presence
that
isnt
noticeable
at
the
first
part
of
the
taste
but
definitely
in
the
end
nothing
too
bitter
to
be
sure
as
this
is
really
balanced
well
mouthfeel
is
fairly

i
really
liked
this

very
smooth

really
enjoyed
this
one
o
nice
winter
treat
not
overly
spicy
and
the
6
1
abv
is
well
hidden
not
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
ever
had
but
a
solid
one
itll
definately
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
day
b
845
not
one
ill
be
seeking
out
again
not
bad
but
not
really
good
either
imo
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
or
much
aroma
woody
nutty
but
in
faint
ways
that
dont
do
it
for
me
pours
dark
brown
with
reddish
background
white
foam
sits
and
is
fluffy
caramel
nose
other
light
winter
spices
taste
is
a
light
malt
with
dark
fruit
infused
caramel
getting
some
raisin
hints
in
there
plums
medium
body
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
above
average
underwhelming
beer
goes
with
underwhelming
music
try
wynton
marsalis
j
mood
cd
or
joe
walsh
ordinary
average
guy
maybe
a
recording
of
the
radio
show
prarie
home
companion
by
garrison
keillor
who
writes
about
a
small
town
in
minnesota
where
all
the
women
are
strong
the
men
are
good
looking
and
the
kids
are
all
above
average
cheers
overall
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
sweet
roast
and
spice
flavors
while
in
some
ways
it
drank
more
like
a
porter
then
a
winter
warmer
it
is
a
good
easy
drinking
brew
o
this
beer
has
many
great
qualities
none
of
which
are
warming
abilities
beautiful
on
the
eyes
and
great
aroma
dimension
flavor
is
a
little
understated
but
has
good
feel
however
i
never
really
sensed
any
spices
to
the
beer
nor
at
6
1
does
it
really
warm
me
up
reminds
me
of
a
good
brown
porter
nevertheless
i
am
satisfied
that
this
beer
was
included
in
my
12
pack
sampler
o
summits
winter
ale
provides
a
smooth
body
with
moderate
heft
for
a
satisfying
coldday
brew
that
incorporates
english
hops
wonderfully
for
a
balanced
flavor
and
touch
of
spiciness
this
beer
avoids
being
lumped
with
the
overspiced
and
sometimes
overplayed
holiday
beers
but
manages
a
subtle
nod
to
them
for
a
nice
winter
treat
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
winter
warmers
but
this
one
is
tasty
i
didnt
like
it
at
first
but
its
grown
on
me
final
thoughts
so
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
that
ive
given
it
in
my
mind
however
its
still
a
great
beer
and
worthy
of
a
place
in
anyones
fridge
during
the
winter
would
i
drink
it
again
of
course
ill
probably
seek
it
out
on
tap
next
time
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
smells
of
lightly
toasted
and
toffee
malts
with
lighter
amounts
of
herbal
character
tastes
of
a
blend
of
chocolate
toasted
and
toffee
malts
with
some
light
spice
and
nuttiness
not
too
fancy
but
not
bad
either
falls
somewhat
on
the
sweeter
side
in
terms
of
balancing
do
this
is
a
winter
warmer
worth
considering
for
those
that
shy
away
from
the
heavilyspiced
contributions
instead
this
beer
is
maltfocused
and
dark
tasting
like
an
understrength
baltic
porter
expect
it
to
serve
in
a
range
of
pairing
roles
from
porter
to
dubbel
to
strong
stout
a
single
finger
off
white
head
with
excellent
retention
on
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
little
light
passing
through
thick
circumferential
lacing
aroma
is
very
malty
with
dark
fruit
chocolate
and
sugary
notes
flavor
is
also
malty
with
strong
smokey
sense
toffee
and
nutty
medium
to
thick
body
and
moderate
carbonation
very
smooth
overall
a
nice
member
of
the
genre
one
of
the
more
flavorful
and
full
bodied
overall
for
a
beer
its
pretty
decent
in
terms
of
flavor
and
its
easier
to
drink
than
some
other
beers
as
a
winter
warmer
there
are
better
beers
of
that
style
in
particular
out
there
o
why
does
everyone
expect
spice
in
a
winter
warmer
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
overall
roasty
and
warming
very
comforting
and
i
can
have
more
than
one
very
palate
friendly
o
this
brew
was
made
for
winter
bold
wintry
flavors
but
somethings
missing
a
decent
brew
for
this
time
of
year
c
overall
a
good
winter
ale
if
not
a
little
weak
in
its
category
other
beers
represent
this
better
but
this
isnt
something
you
should
pass
up
on
this
was
decent
with
a
lot
going
on
with
it
flavor
wise
i
was
actually
looking
for
a
little
stronger
spice
character
out
of
this
to
help
set
it
within
the
winter
warmer
style
as
this
came
off
a
bit
more
to
me
like
an
american
porter
at
times
never
the
less
i
still
enjoyed
this
for
what
it
was
im
glad
i
picked
a
bottle
up
this
is
an
easydrinking
pleasant
mild
winter
ale
not
overly
spiced
which
is
fine
by
me
o
this
beer
goes
down
way
too
quickly
its
sweet
as
a
nut
and
a
real
joy
to
drink
really
nice
body
on
this
beer
im
a
fan
or
malt
and
this
delivers
overall
a
very
enjoyable
very
seasonal
beer
overall
i
believe
this
is
an
excellent
brew
i
was
a
little
unsure
of
it
when
i
picked
it
to
round
out
my
mixandmatch
sixer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
had
no
idea
it
was
as
dark
as
it
was
and
was
caught
off
guard
after
the
pour
when
i
smelled
this
beer
the
complex
aroma
really
hit
me
and
i
was
impressed
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
beer
o
to
me
this
is
a
good
brew
it
has
the
warming
affect
that
a
winter
ale
should
it
taste
a
lot
like
a
normal
ale
with
some
caramel
undertones
not
bad
beef
flavor
is
a
little
weird
but
it
is
still
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
have
a
hunch
that
the
recipe
for
this
might
have
changed
as
older
reviews
characterize
this
as
an
ampedup
porter
this
years
version
is
much
more
like
a
moderatelyhopped
nut
brown
ale
rather
enjoyable
overall
overall
im
really
impressed
with
this
one
it
has
a
great
flavor
profile
appearance
and
it
doesnt
over
use
the
spices
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
i
think
it
would
satisfy
a
party
of
people
who
only
like
light
beers
with
the
other
half
only
liking
dark
beers
bleh
o
its
a
good
ale
to
have
in
the
cold
but
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
my
winter
warmer
standards
o
nice
winter
ale
nothing
too
special
here
though
mild
malt
toastiness
molasses
cocoa
powder
light
malty
flavors
not
sweet
or
bitter
really
light
bodied
nearly
watery
but
stops
short
easy
going
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
but
it
has
an
autumnal
character
and
is
easy
enough
to
drink
it
tastes
very
porterish
not
very
winter
warmery
but
not
a
bad
beer
overall
a
pretty
solid
winter
warmer
very
good
use
of
malts
sweet
but
balanced
o
this
tastes
and
feels
like
a
winter
warmer
to
me
roasted
malty
smooth
and
warm
i
liked
this
better
than
the
first
snow
ale
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
reddish
hue
there
is
a
good
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
lace
the
nose
is
sweet
caramel
and
some
mild
spice
as
well
as
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
malt
character
good
light
spice
finish
is
a
bit
dry
but
a
nice
balance
between
normal
beer
and
an
overspiced
seasonal
a
solid
winter
warmer
o
its
a
decent
winter
brew
has
some
good
flavor
for
a
winter
beer
nor
overly
spicy
or
hefty
on
the
cinnamon
good
solid
amber
ale
o
its
an
ok
tasting
beer
but
there
are
enough
better
winter
warmers
out
there
id
probably
pass
on
this
in
the
future
a
pretty
decent
beer
worthy
a
spot
on
your
to
do
list
ordinary
not
a
must
have
mild
is
the
word
that
i
would
use
to
describe
this
beer
there
is
nothing
spectacular
about
it
and
at
the
same
time
i
would
not
hesitate
to
try
again
really
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
muted
version
of
summits
great
northern
porter
which
is
a
beer
that
i
love
d
a
nice
winter
warmer
with
some
nice
caramel
malts
would
have
again
notes
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
hoppy
and
spiced
porter
mayber
a
slight
english
taste
hops
or
yeast
possibly
not
bad
but
nothing
really
engaging
or
intriguing
pours
a
very
dark
red
almost
brown
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
malty
coffee
with
cream
sort
of
aroma
the
caramel
and
roasted
malts
are
the
standout
flavor
in
this
beer
helping
to
create
complexity
with
a
distinct
nuttiness
and
touch
of
toffee
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
seems
to
be
played
down
quite
a
bit
letting
the
malts
express
their
flavors
the
woody
english
hops
express
themselves
a
little
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
this
is
a
beer
best
left
to
warm
up
quite
a
bit
before
that
first
sip
otherwise
its
complexity
is
far
less
evident
toffeeish
malts
in
the
finish
and
a
hint
of
tannin
overall
a
pretty
decent
winter
warmer
but
i
think
the
drinkability
would
be
better
if
it
had
a
slightly
more
memorable
finish
while
not
the
boldest
or
most
drinkable
winter
seasonal
it
does
compensate
with
its
own
unique
complexities
the
wintry
flavors
are
there
probably
best
enjoyed
with
holiday
chocolates
or
other
nutty
confections
pours
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
reddish
hue
there
is
a
good
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
lace
the
nose
is
sweet
caramel
and
some
mild
spice
as
well
as
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
malt
character
good
light
spice
the
age
has
treated
this
one
well
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
the
spice
comes
through
a
bit
too
much
overall
a
nice
balance
between
normal
beer
and
an
overspiced
seasonal
even
with
the
slight
astringency
i
think
this
ones
pretty
tasty
and
a
great
malty
wither
ale
this
has
really
strong
drinkability
the
flavors
do
not
overwhelm
like
some
winter
warmers
do
and
the
alcohol
is
lower
which
also
helps
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
actually
prefer
over
the
majority
of
others
in
the
style
ive
had
just
another
solid
beer
from
summit
drinkability
someone
call
summit
and
tell
them
winter
ale
is
not
a
winter
warmer
at
least
in
the
liquid
christmas
tree
sense
it
is
instead
a
solid
and
malty
beer
pours
a
thick
dark
blackish
brown
light
brown
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
quickly
the
smell
is
rather
understated
and
bland
a
little
sour
with
some
burnt
toast
notes
but
mostly
just
kind
of
bland
the
tasted
follows
suit
a
hint
of
a
sweet
malty
body
with
some
smokey
roasted
grain
flavors
followed
by
a
hint
of
sour
at
the
finish
a
few
herbal
hop
flavors
come
out
but
very
few
this
beer
just
need
more
of
something
either
more
of
a
sweet
malty
taste
or
more
of
a
bitter
herbal
hop
taste
or
more
of
a
burnt
roasted
grain
coffee
taste
just
more
of
something
i
usually
dont
like
spiced
beers
but
maybe
thats
what
it
is
missing
it
was
just
kind
of
forgettable
slight
tangy
spice
up
front
chocolate
and
roasted
nut
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
burnt
carmel
cheeers
o
nicely
done
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
nice
brown
color
inch
think
head
smelled
nicely
of
coffee
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
hops
and
just
a
pinch
of
malty
goodness
laced
nicely
down
the
side
of
my
glass
as
i
worked
through
it
did
the
perfect
job
for
a
winter
warmer
warmed
me
up
and
went
down
nice
and
smooth
great
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
good
the
beer
had
a
good
body
and
a
smooth
silky
carbonation
the
alcohol
did
not
show
through
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
summit
makes
it
was
quite
enjoyable
factoring
in
the
flavor
aroma
body
and
abv
good
but
not
exceptional
drinkability
drinkability
this
brew
does
warm
you
up
nicely
in
the
winter
and
doesnt
have
any
overpowering
tastes
that
would
deter
anyone
from
grabbing
another
bottle
notes
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
lacks
a
bit
in
what
i
usually
look
for
in
a
winter
warmer
its
not
quite
as
balanced
as
i
would
like
but
overall
summits
winter
ale
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
and
at
least
worth
a
try
d
a
very
nice
rich
ale
nice
as
a
fallwinter
beer
sets
a
great
mood
for
a
chilly
afternoon
or
evening
clear
liquid
very
dark
red
almost
brown
cream
colored
head
had
great
retention
and
some
nice
looking
lacing
malt
dominant
smell
with
some
winter
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
complex
flavor
has
all
the
above
elements
strong
enough
to
be
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
with
any
one
taste
medium
body
appropriate
amount
of
carbonation
good
all
around
brew
fits
the
style
nicely
md
medium
to
light
body
carbonation
seems
pretty
average
drinkability
is
okay
nothing
too
special
taste
follows
suit
pretty
well
with
the
roasty
malts
more
prominent
but
still
maintaining
plenty
of
sweetness
there
is
some
bittering
leafy
hops
on
the
finish
almost
minty
even
the
dark
malts
are
pretty
nice
but
there
is
not
much
depth
here
pretty
much
a
one
trick
pony
not
bad
i
would
not
mind
having
another
one
of
these
sometime
down
the
road
md
medium
bodied
brew
big
coffee
taste
that
keeps
smooth
as
it
goes
down
slight
taste
of
sweet
and
spices
chocolate
is
the
biggest
flavor
with
some
spices
mixed
in
overall
i
enjoyed
the
brew
and
more
than
likely
have
again
mouthfeel
makes
me
think
im
getting
a
little
cherry
and
tree
in
my
beer
very
little
but
its
neat
its
there
enjoyable
to
drink
relatively
inexpensive
exceeded
expectations
very
good
drinkability
but
at
this
size
one
was
enough
with
dinner
a
decent
winter
brew
i
could
session
this
easily
however
i
am
so
used
to
the
big
winter
brews
that
this
lighter
offering
feels
slightly
off
if
you
would
have
lied
to
me
and
called
this
a
german
spring
something
or
other
i
might
have
liked
it
better
thats
psycology
for
you
this
beer
is
not
very
assertive
in
the
flavor
department
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
flavor
with
a
touch
of
complexity
overall
an
ok
winter
warmer
it
seems
as
if
every
winter
warmer
ive
had
this
season
have
had
completely
different
taste
profiles
i
guess
each
brewer
has
their
own
interpretations
of
this
style
nothing
offensive
here
nothing
outstanding
overall
a
very
solid
offering
and
a
welcome
component
of
the
winter
sampler
pack
nothing
that
blows
your
socks
off
but
definitely
a
pleasant
pour
poured
into
a
12oz
mug
this
shows
a
nice
reddishbrown
color
not
quite
opaque
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
nose
has
a
lot
of
roasted
notes
with
sweet
caramel
the
roast
is
less
prominent
to
taste
but
still
a
main
component
together
with
some
modest
cocoa
caramel
and
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
though
no
hop
flavor
comes
through
the
body
is
a
little
thin
given
the
strength
and
maltiness
purchased
from
blue
max
liquors
in
burnsville
mn
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
body
with
a
thick
lighttan
head
and
leave
good
lacing
aroma
is
of
chocolate
malt
and
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
flavor
is
dominated
by
nutty
sweet
malts
good
drinkability
but
this
is
really
a
nut
brown
ale
and
not
what
i
would
call
a
winter
ale
d
an
all
around
good
beer
that
fits
the
style
excellently
this
is
my
first
outing
with
summit
and
i
am
impressed
the
aroma
did
not
leave
me
any
lasting
impressions
but
the
beer
had
a
rich
deep
malty
kick
coupled
with
a
nice
hoppiness
about
it
it
was
a
fantastic
beer
to
pair
with
a
strongly
flavoured
dinner
such
as
i
was
having
but
i
would
not
consider
it
for
more
than
a
beer
or
two
with
dinner
as
it
was
too
heavy
on
the
palate
for
more
than
a
couple
of
beers
in
a
few
hours
drinkability
i
dont
plan
on
buying
this
beer
again
it
wasnt
really
offensive
but
it
just
didnt
seem
to
bring
anything
special
to
the
table
however
i
wouldnt
object
to
drinking
it
if
offered
pours
a
a
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
small
head
and
a
little
sticky
lacing
the
smell
was
some
cocoa
and
chocolate
with
some
hops
and
malts
and
toffee
the
taste
was
some
cocoa
and
coffee
and
some
currant
fruits
mixed
with
grassy
hops
with
a
caramel
malt
finish
overall
this
drank
like
a
light
porter
or
stout
maybe
a
brown
it
was
good
a
little
thin
for
the
category
but
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
drinkability
despite
being
called
a
winter
warmer
here
this
is
really
a
rich
sweet
and
malty
brown
ale
summit
also
calls
it
a
brown
ale
quite
nice
overall
but
a
little
dull
for
a
winter
ale
drinkability
is
decent
for
a
winter
brew
this
gets
the
job
done
but
it
is
easily
forgotten
due
to
the
base
quality
of
the
overall
pour
it
lacks
any
defining
qualities
overall
impression
a
very
nice
porterlike
winter
warmer
that
has
held
up
quite
well
in
my
basement
and
may
have
gained
a
little
complexity
im
so
far
resisting
the
temptation
to
go
downstairs
and
open
another
one
d
good
flavor
not
too
complex
but
still
interesting
enough
slightly
higher
alcohol
level
may
keep
some
from
drinking
this
all
night
but
still
worth
having
one
or
two
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
by
summit
brewing
so
far
mouthfeel
is
a
little
disappointing
compared
to
the
flavor
this
beer
has
a
little
thicker
would
be
nice
d
overall
a
good
rendition
of
a
winter
warmer
but
just
not
something
that
makes
my
tastebuds
dance
had
many
winter
warmers
this
season
and
was
the
least
impressive
d
smooth
overall
i
could
have
a
few
in
sitting

1
the
initial
poor
and
smell
i
thought
this
would
be
a
really
good
winter
beer
then
i
started
to
drink
and
i
thought
the
taste
was
alright
then
i
got
to
the
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
and
there
was
really
nothing
special
about
it
no
hops
chocolate
or
coffee
taste
or
spices
i
was
dissappointed
had
on
tap
at
murphys
pub
in
champaign
pours
a
reddishbrown
with
medium
thick
offwhite
head
that
lingered
well
and
left
good
lacing
both
the
nose
and
flavor
were
a
very
good
mix
of
caramel
coffee
and
licorice
with
the
taste
more
dominant
than
the
aroma
as
the
beer
warmed
the
licorice
became
more
overpowering
than
the
other
elements
which
led
to
a
tingly
mouth
and
warming
finish
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
at
all
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
winter
brew
but
theres
nothing
that
stands
out
too
much
here
the
aroma
is
very
toasted
and
almost
smokey
with
coffee
toffee
and
a
touch
of
spice
the
appearance
is
dark
red
brown
with
a
foamy
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
too
tangy
and
acidic
the
palate
is
average
for
the
style
overall
its
ok
but
not
that
good
this
is
a
really
good
winter
beer
it
is
very
dark
sort
of
like
a
porter
but
clear
it
also
has
the
coffee
scent
and
taste
that
goes
well
with
the
low
carbonation
it
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
roasted
malt
and
bitter
hops
which
makes
it
really
easy
to
drink
overall
a
complex
beer
pretty
strong
tasting
plenty
of
flavor
and
a
solid
bitterness
here
not
one
for
a
hot
day
out
in
the
boat
for
sure
a
winter
warmer
style
brew
d
very
interesting
brew
and
i
think
i
could
go
back
to
this
one
d
decent
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
ive
had
really
makes
me
feel
good
about
winter
in
minnesota
poured
a
thin
head
which
sticks
nicely
to
the
side
of
the
glass
colour
is
very
dark
darker
than
some
of
the
other
winter
ales
i
tried
i
could
smell
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
malt
tastes
great
and
goes
down
quite
easily
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
it
was
a
good
bit
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
this
is
great
more
stout
like
than
some
other
winter
warmers
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
would
recommend
this
d
easy
to
drink
wouldnt
mind
having
another
pours
a
dark
red
color
body
average
creamcolored
head
somewhat
diminishing
malty
aroma
some
strawberry
some
hoppiness
and
english
maltiness
not
a
strong
aroma
hoppy
dark
chocolately
malt
taste
some
alcohol
and
some
toffee
okay
body
somewhat
watery
very
porterishstouty
taste
and
palate
color
is
dark
amber
with
and
off
white
head
smells
and
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
roasted
malts
present
as
well
faint
hoppiness
as
well
mouthfeel
was
the
best
part
in
my
opinion
medium
body
and
very
creamy
excellent
definately
worth
a
try
very
well
balanced
complexity
is
outstanding
a
marriage
of
an
american
brown
and
a
porter
i
am
definitely
picking
up
more
soon
over
and
out
i
want
the
original
recipie
back
d
if
you
are
in
mn
you
know
that
this
beer
is
everywhere
from
the
highest
end
beer
bars
to
the
diviest
joints
around
is
it
drinkable
hell
yea
and
if
you
spend
enough
nights
with
the
locals
this
is
probably
what
you
will
end
up
drinking
a
lot
of
d
somewhat
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
d
drank
somewhat
like
a
porter
to
me
not
a
bad
thing
very
smooth
for
the
color
d
moderately
drinkable
the
malt
flavor
could
easily
overwhelm
the
palate
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
and
at
the
price
you
cant
go
wrong
i
would
suggest
you
at
least
give
this
one
a
shot
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
amber
highlights
a
one
finger
tan
colored
head
with
big
bubbles
and
light
lacing
smells
just
about
like
every
other
summit
beer
light
hopping
cooked
malts
with
the
addition
of
some
caramel
and
light
spices
flavor
is
of
some
lightly
roasted
and
biscuity
malts
light
chocolate
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
an
average
hop
bitterness
i
swear
every
summit
brew
has
the
exact
same
hopping
i
always
know
what
to
expect
from
them
creamy
mouthfeel
a
bit
light
decent
carbonation
this
is
actually
better
than
most
summit
beers
and
would
probably
take
this
one
over
all
their
others
if
it
were
available
year
round
average
winter
warmer
at
best
however
not
one
to
let
me
down
i
had
a
feeling
summit
would
have
a
nice
winter
seasonal
this
is
a
fantastic
strong
ale
abundant
roasted
aroma
very
rich
and
appealing
awesome
pour
amberbrown
color
with
a
long
lasting
one
inch
light
tan
head
and
layers
upon
layers
of
lacing
mouthfeel
isnt
as
full
as
expected
but
its
smooth
and
gratifying
flavor
is
a
half
step
under
the
great
aroma
very
malty
almost
drinks
like
a
porter
if
it
were
darker
i
would
be
fooled
some
smokiness
with
mild
flavors
of
chocolate
licorice
and
coffee
small
hop
presence
overall
a
great
beer
any
time
of
the
year
overall
very
good
and
very
smooth
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
this
beer
defines
mediocrity
ok
to
drink
look
at
inhale
nothing
stands
out
a
completely
forgettable
beer
dsmooth
on
the
way
down
and
very
drinkable
wont
fatigue
the
palate
no
alcoholic
warmth
due
to
a
tolerable
abv
so
a
couple
wont
send
you
to
bed
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
i
love
summit
and
i
love
winter
so
its
a
perfect
combo
when
i
found
this
beer
at
hums
i
did
a
little
dance
in
the
isle
because
this
beer
represents
the
start
of
the
winter
beer
season
and
that
is
a
wonderful
thing
i
will
recommend
this
brew
to
others
despite
the
issues
i
have
with
the
appearance
and
texture
im
thinking
the
sight
and
feel
may
be
better
when
sampled
from
draught
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
deep
red
when
held
to
the
light
there
was
a
12
cream
color
head
that
left
a
nice
line
on
the
glass
as
it
thinned
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
somewhat
light
with
mild
hints
of
malt
some
oatmeal
smell
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
a
little
better
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
but
is
a
little
thin
and
slightly
watered
down
in
the
finish
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
was
a
nice
surprise
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
i
love
the
nose
in
particular
many
beers
have
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
characteristics
but
this
one
has
a
great
milk
chocolatecocoa
powder
nose
that
is
somewhat
unique
i
wish
there
was
more
of
that
in
the
flavor
but
nevertheless
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
d
an
excellent
winter
warmer
this
category
is
very
hit
or
miss
and
this
is
a
definite
hit
i
love
all
of
the
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
is
reallyl
nice
quality
quality
beer
final
thought
a
very
nice
winter
brew
from
the
twin
cities
definitely
will
have
one
next
season
overall
impression
a
solid
beer
great
craftsmanship
here
is
obvious
as
they
get
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
out
of
basic
ingredients
my
favorite
summit
beer
yet
for
a
winter
ale
it
is
surprisingly
light
and
drinkable
it
has
a
fresh
warmth
that
i
find
very
appealing
it
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
that
lingers
the
hop
finish
dances
breifly
on
the
tongue
and
dissapears
as
fast
as
it
showed
up
i
could
easily
knock
down
2
or
3
of
these
bad
boys
on
a
cold
winters
night
or
even
a
cold
spring
night
for
all
you
buckeyes
who
feel
my
pain
d
a
nice
low
alcohol
complex
winter
ale
i
look
forward
to
for
next
year
12oz
brown
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
glass
poured
a
deep
brown
with
less
than
a
finger
of
white
head
deep
malty
aroma
molasses
and
caramelized
sugar
rich
malty
flavor
and
mouthfeel
plenty
of
caramel
malt
not
a
lot
of
hop
bitterness
but
enough
to
balance
out
the
malt
sweetness
very
easy
drinking
solid
beer
i
like
it
but
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
more
then
once
a
session
the
lacing
on
this
one
did
pretty
well
it
had
good
aromatics
and
mouthfeel
with
the
taste
being
more
subtle
drinkability
could
stand
to
be
a
little
bigger
in
all
respects
to
make
it
a
better
winter
ale
but
as
such
does
alright
for
its
self
d
its
ok
but
seems
more
like
a
porter
i
figured
i
better
start
reviewing
the
old
school
local
brewery
a
little
more
and
picked
up
a
sampler
the
winter
ale
hasnt
stood
out
in
my
mind
among
summits
offerings
its
better
than
their
octoberfest
but
not
too
special
its
a
decent
beer
though
d
a
nice
winter
warmer
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
however
i
was
happy
to
have
picked
this
up
as
a
single
but
might
not
want
an
entire
sixpack
man
i
like
this
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
brown
ale
and
summits
winter
ale
with
its
dark
appearance
roasted
malt
hint
of
coffee
and
hop
flavors
come
together
to
create
what
i
feel
a
well
balanced
beer
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
spice
flavors
like
other
winter
warmers
which
is
alright
by
me
reminds
me
of
big
skys
moose
drool
all
in
all
worth
a
try
be
prepared
for
a
different
kind
of
warmer
with
this
one
a
little
shy
on
sweetness
and
spice
but
original
in
its
stoutporter
leanings
drinkability
i
am
glad
i
reviewed
this
beer
because
it
opened
me
up
to
some
smells
and
flavors
that
i
have
not
experienced
before
in
beer
being
that
i
am
new
at
this
that
being
said
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
perhaps
the
best
beer
ive
every
had
from
summit
however
i
didnt
use
to
like
their
grand
and
a
few
bottles
sitting
in
the
basement
fridge
aged
a
few
months
i
guess
were
much
better
than
i
ever
remembered
too
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
from
summit
all
in
all
a
nice
winter
warmer
overall
i
think
that
this
carries
alot
of
the
characteristics
of
a
chocolate
stout
not
a
winter
warmer
it
has
a
low
abv
and
alot
of
the
same
aromas
and
tastes
usually
winter
warmers
will
have
a
spicy
taste
this
one
does
not
have
that
that
being
said
i
do
really
like
this
brew
too
bad
it
requires
me
to
travel
to
minnesota
for
work
yuk
to
get
some
more
of
it
it
makes
a
great
session
beer
as
well
i
will
have
to
say
that
it
was
greatly
enjoyable
pours
a
suprisingly
dark
color
for
a
winter
ale
nice
2
finger
headthe
lasts
a
nice
while
nice
caramel
malt
aroma
with
hint
of
coffee
reminds
me
of
a
light
stout
both
in
flavor
and
taste
very
drinkable
not
much
of
a
warmer
due
to
a
low
alcohol
content
a
great
addition
to
my
winter
mix
it
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
brought
on
by
its
low
carbonation
and
heavy
body
a
very
nice
cold
day
beer
and
i
definately
will
be
buying
more
of
this
during
the
winter
months
recommended
this
beer
starts
with
a
robust
porter
like
aroma
from
black
malts
combined
with
a
dark
fruit
sweetness
these
carry
over
into
the
taste
and
are
similar
but
smoother
than
youd
get
in
an
american
robust
porter
its
more
like
a
nut
brown
ale
with
a
roasted
edge
to
it
i
should
mention
theres
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
taste
but
its
really
an
afterthought
overall
this
is
a
fairly
clean
winter
warmer
with
a
nice
use
of
black
malts
i
will
drink
many
more
of
these
this
winter
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
winters
i
usually
not
a
big
brown
ale
guy
but
something
with
the
spice
just
makes
it
work
for
me
i
live
right
next
to
blu
max
in
burnsville
but
i
decided
that
to
stick
to
an
old
favorite
tonight
rather
then
somethig
new
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
lighter
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
a
heavier
body
and
a
nice
warming
sensation
give
this
brew
a
good
mouthfeel
the
body
seems
to
be
just
right
for
the
style
this
is
a
brew
that
ill
definitely
be
buying
in
the
future
however
ill
prolly
not
buy
it
till
the
winter
rolls
round
again
and
even
then
ill
try
some
other
warmers
before
i
come
back
to
it
but
i
definitely
will
come
back
it
just
tastes
so
good
drinkability
not
as
spicy
or
high
abv
as
i
normally
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
easy
to
drink
not
spectacular
but
a
good
beer
indeed
definitely
better
and
cheaper
than
samuel
smiths
winter
welcome
this
beer
has
some
interesting
traits
but
none
of
them
totally
wowed
me
and
i
hate
the
way
i
always
get
metallic
tastes
from
summit
bottles
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
from
summit
pretty
clean
and
fairly
drinkable
although
there
seems
to
be
some
alcohol
warmth
despite
the
relatively
low
alcohol
summit
winter
ale
was
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
good
clarity
the
offwhite
head
was
short
and
creamy
leaving
some
nice
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
malty
and
toasty
the
taste
was
sweet
malt
roasted
grain
and
some
bitterness
with
a
dry
finish
the
body
was
medium
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
its
a
nice
winter
warmer
thats
not
overloaded
all
of
the
spices
ooh
nice
somewhat
sweet
with
some
hop
overlaying
hoppy
chocolately
brown
ale
good
balance
i
must
comment
that
sub6
hardly
seems
very
warming
though
i
enjoy
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
blackish
color
with
ruby
hues
a
decent
sized
offwhite
head
thats
shrinks
pretty
quick
and
some
pretty
nice
lacing
aroma
is
spicy
if
anything
pretty
tame
taste
is
better
spiced
nicely
with
a
nice
malting
a
little
roasty
with
some
brown
sugars
perhaps
light
hopping
and
a
nice
carameltoffeecoffee
through
the
middle
a
good
medium
body
and
nicely
carbonated
while
still
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
a
good
mn
beer
a
yearly
partaking
a
good
winter
warmer
d
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
the
flavor
is
malty
but
not
to
heavy
has
a
good
hop
spice
but
not
over
powering
nice
full
flavored
brew
this
beer
is
on
style
verdict
i
would
like
to
see
a
more
rich
body
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
the
flavors
didnt
meld
all
that
well
not
a
pour
outer
or
turn
downer
but
i
was
not
impressed
drinkability
is
ok
id
have
another
two
of
these
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
too
long
now
to
be
disappointed
but
a
funky
offflavor
in
the
tap
pour
i
had
last
night
made
me
wonder
pours
the
same
crimsonamber
i
remember
so
well
with
a
rocky
dark
tan
head
nose
is
pungent
verily
oozing
the
contents
of
its
unctious
nutbrownonsteroids
self
into
the
air
that
surrounds
my
tiny
head
so
far
so
good
lace
that
stretches
from
here
to
next
year
really
impressive
when
poured
into
the
right
glass
bulb
in
this
case
and
speaking
of
right
glass
did
anyone
else
notice
the
new
logoembossed
bottles
i
thought
so
nice
touch
in
the
packaging
department
and
definitely
adds
to
an
already
great
beer
and
solid
brewery
the
nose
offers
toffee
rum
and
some
dates
along
with
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
and
carmalizedroasted
malts
ala
the
great
northern
porter
and
thats
a
good
thing
as
gnp
has
been
my
favorite
summit
brand
since
day
1
the
diacetyl
doesnt
bother
me
here
and
never
has
as
ive
found
it
to
be
a
consistent
part
of
summits
stylistic
interpretation
for
years
a
bit
creamy
on
the
tongue
with
evidence
of
the
alcohol
both
present
and
welcoming
not
a
thin
brew
if
anyone
ever
calls
this
beer
thin
please
give
them
a
bowl
of
oatmeal
to
go
with
it
it
can
be
a
bit
sweet
for
some
in
fact
id
go
so
far
as
to
say
treaclysweet
at
one
moment
but
offset
by
a
slightlysmokey
roasted
malt
bitterness
the
next
this
bitterness
lingers
quite
a
bit
the
way
a
nice
hop
bitterness
does
and
acts
as
the
counterpoint
to
the
fruity
notes
cherry
plum
and
cocoa
as
it
warms
a
bit
fruity
in
the
right
way
roasty
and
toasty
in
the
right
ways
malt
and
alcohol
summit
winter
is
a
great
beer
that
has
probably
been
outshined
by
other
beersofthemoment
in
the
past
ten
years
or
so
but
its
been
consistent
year
after
year
for
almost
as
long
as
i
can
remember
reason
enough
for
me
to
buy
a
case
every
winter
pours
out
a
clear
but
very
dark
mahoghany
colour
with
a
slight
head
without
much
lace
a
very
spicy
and
maltydoughy
character
in
the
nose
along
with
some
northwest
hops
fullish
medium
body
and
mouthfeel
tastes
of
alcohol
spiciness
which
seems
quick
to
warm
the
senses
the
malt
profile
is
hard
to
nail
down
some
very
slight
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
are
discernible
dough
and
yeast
again
the
spice
and
alcohol
notes
come
through
in
the
end
along
with
a
hop
bite
finish
that
dances
on
the
tongue
like
a
liquid
candy
bar
and
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
that
seems
appropriate
for
the
season
dark
dark
chocolatey
brown
almost
completely
opaque

goodsized
head
smell
was
not
as
prominent
as
i
would
have
liked
taste
was
like
like
biting
on
a
delicious
old
plank
earthy
and
a
touch
of
roasted
nuts
with
just
a
warm
homey
feel
to
it

not
overwhelming

full

thick
syrupy

which
was
really
nice
for
this
beer
i
plan
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
hand
all
winter
overall
impression
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
a
nice
counter
to
many
of
the
spiced
winter
beers
on
the
market
drinkability
this
is
a
very
hearty
and
very
good
beer
and
is
very
sessionable
this
shoud
be
available
yearround
drinks
easy
but
not
the
most
engaging
winter
warmer
this
was
surprisingly
a
nice
brew
lots
of
chocolatey
malts
and
some
odd
fruity
flavors
going
on
in
this
beer
very
similar
to
medocinos
2005
winter
ale
full
bodied
not
much
lacing
and
a
decent
head
on
the
pour
pours
a
dark
dark
colour
blackish
red
very
underpriced
and
a
nice
brew
here
oh
and
on
top
of
that
all
this
was
a
2005
edition
refreshing
and
goes
very
well
with
savory
foods
like
lamb
stew
solid
drinkablity
ill
get
some
more
of
this
next
winter
this
was
a
well
bold
spiced
beer
that
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
small
head
its
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
bold
spices
and
dark
fruits
its
amazingly
smooth
for
its
stlye
of
beer
and
yet
it
is
still
on
the
bitter
side
the
finish
kinda
lingers
of
drak
fruits
and
spice
its
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
since
it
is
so
smooth
and
tasty
probably
the
best
beer
that
i
drank
from
the
summit
variety
pack
though
a
bit
sweet
and
worty
its
a
solid
brew
with
nothing
to
really
complain
about
typical
of
winer
warmers
the
beer
has
a
big
molassas
sweetness
with
a
nutty
spicy
hoppy
flavor
and
aroma
creamy
and
almost
thick
to
the
mouth
finishes
a
bit
too
sweet
the
alcohol
helps
to
thin
the
beer
in
the
end
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
in
the
winter
or
any
other
time

at
milk
chocolate
well
moderated
roasted
malt
flavors
with
bit
of

seemed
to

is
roasted

however
nothing
really
makes
this
beer
stand
out
in

of

picked
up

visiting
madison
wi

neck

the

with

pretty
boring
considering
the
style
it
is
categorized
under
definately
more
of
a
brown
ale
drinkability
very
much
so
mouthfeel
is
smooth
sugary
with
the
nuts
and
chocolate
lightness
grazing
over
the
tongue
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
thick
white
foamy
head
disappears
too
quickly
some
patchy
lace
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
roasty
aroma
almost
like
coffee
malt
flavor
is
a
touch
roasty
but
seems
shallow
this
falls
off
on
the
back
end
some
bitterness
along
with
the
malt
medium
body
carbonation
is
low
overall
sort
of
like
a
brown
aleporter
good
change
of
pace
for
winter
warmers
but
i
would
have
liked
more
roasty
flavors
that
the
nose
seemed
to
be
getting
at
still
a
pretty
good
winter
brew
the
taste
is
very
much
like
the
smell
toasted
coffee
flavor
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
nice
at
temp
above
what
the
frig
keeps
it
at
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
winter
night
or
day
or
morning
this
is
not
a
classic
but
nicely
done
there
is
a
cleanness
to
this
that
makes
it
lager
like
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
pours
a
deep
mahagony
color
with
ruby
hues
a
finger
of
tan
head
falls
moderately
slow
to
a
full
coat
over
top
very
pretty
brew
nose
is
not
as
great
there
is
a
breadyness
that
borders
on
what
i
associate
with
socklike
aromas
i
also
get
some
molasses
but
i
really
do
not
like
the
aroma
of
this
beer
flavor
is
pretty
well
the
same
as
the
aroma
it
has
a
sort
of
fruityspice
almost
like
cherry
but
not
in
a
good
way
with
molasses
it
just
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
the
feel
is
a
very
light
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
i
am
very
underimpressed
with
this
brew
it
does
nothing
to
draw
me
in
with
the
nose
or
flavor
the
feel
is
weak
and
its
just
not
all
that
good
this
pours
a
very
dark
amber
the
head
is
minimal
but
good
lacing
on
the
glass
indicates
ample
amounts
of
malt
used
the
smell
is
fruity
with
burnt
malt
the
taste
is
rich
and
plummy
with
a
hint
of
pure
malt
and
cherry
not
a
lot
of
hop
presence
is
felt
the
mouthfeel
has
that
characteristic
summit
crispness
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
ales
870
poured
a
dark
amber
brown
head
dissipated
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
with
nice
light
lacing
aroma
was
only
slight
but
roasted
malt
and
coffee
was
detectable
the
taste
is
full
of
soft
chcoloate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
flavours
the
higher
abv
is
slightly
noticeable
and
l
provides
a
bit
of
warming
affect
something
that
i
certainly
enjoy
and
expect
in
a
winter
warmer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
a
very
delicious
and
drinkable
beer
particularly
on
a
cool
winter
evening
ive
had
summits
extra
pale
ale
many
times
just
never
been
inspired
to
review
it
and
it
always
strikes
me
as
especially
smoothcreamy
this
beer
is
the
same
way
from
looking
at
the
bottle
it
doesnt
look
like
they
bottle
condition
their
brews
but
whatever
theyre
doing
to
carbonate
them
its
working
well
this
beer
is
a
bit
like
a
brown
a
bit
like
a
porter
and
im
a
fan
of
both
styles
between
the
taste
and
the
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
quite
the
drinkable
beer
i
wish
it
were
a
little
less
drying
to
the
palate
though
i
dont
mind
the
lack
of
sweetnesswhy
is
that
also
called
dry
but
the
other
aspects
make
me
want
more
definitely
worth
a
try
i
got
the
six
pack
on
sale
at
binnys
for
5
99
and
i
might
head
back
to
get
another
one
to
stock
up
this
one
pours
a
dark
deep
mohagany
brown
color
with
very
little
head
a
little
light
barely
seeps
through
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
little
weak
i
notice
roasted
malt
smells
paired
with
maybe
a
slight
berry
smell
nothing
too
strong
the
taste
is
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
with
adjuncts
ive
had
better
the
mouthfeel
is
also
quite
thin
for
the
style
drinkability
is
okay
i
wont
have
any
trouble
with
it
but
it
wont
be
hard
to
pick
something
else
instead
of
this
one
next
time
i
could
put
myself
on
autopilot
with
this
one
i
expected
maybe
more
richness
or
heartiness
to
the
malt
but
2
or
3
could
go
very
easily
after
work
not
much
alcohol
taste
to
speak
of
12
ounce
bottle
summit
winter
ale
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
dense
head
weak
roasted
malt
aroma
with
earthy
hops
the
aroma
improves
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
is
very
nutty
with
some
roasted
malt
and
mild
smoke
not
too
sweet
much
more
flavorful
than
i
expected
from
the
aroma
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
i
really
enjoy
the
nutty
smoked
flavor
creamy
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
i
like
that
this
beer
isnt
over
spiced
like
so
many
other
winter
beers
the
nose
on
the
summit
winter
is
nice
and
nuttyroasted
the
taste
is
similar
a
strong
roasted
bitterness
in
the
body
though
a
bit
thin
and
caramelly
upfront
this
is
definitely
not
a
winter
warmer
but
it
is
a
good
little
nut
brown
from
an
underrated
brewery
yep
drinkablity
would
be
one
a
night
good
stuff
overall
a
nice
offering
from
summit
the
flavor
balance
is
nice
and
the
darker
notes
are
not
overwhelming
pick
it
up
in
the
mix
pack
if
you
want
to
sample
this
one
deep
black
in
color
quickly
receding
head
with
slight
lace
slightly
spicy
gingery
aroma
full
flavor
just
slightly
sweet
with
chocolate
and
cherry
or
currant
notes
full
mouthfeel
that
gently
recedes
easy
drinking
not
overpowering
but
i
think
id
stop
at
one
drinking
this
in
early
november
05
from
a
summit
sampler
pack
i
think
thisll
be
great
by
the
fire
on
a
winter
night
this
brew
pours
a
solid
black
color
the
head
is
small
and
white
and
recedes
quickly
leaving
lacing
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
ginger
in
the
background
the
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malt
more
so
than
the
aroma
it
is
like
a
good
porter
with
some
spicey
tones
flavorful
yet
mellow
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fuller
than
medium
bodied
and
there
is
enough
carbonation
to
make
thing
interesting
overall
this
is
yet
another
wonderful
brew
from
summit
this
one
will
make
a
great
session
beer
for
the
long
winter
ahead
winter
ale
is
okay
if
you
like
your
winter
brews
to
be
on
the
lighter
side
summit
puts
out
a
wonderful
porter
great
northern
so
im
not
sure
what
purpose
this
one
serves
it
may
be
enjoyable
but
its
far
from
outstanding
another
great
beer
from
brewery
bearing
the
name
of
the
best
known
street
in
my
state
capital
pours
a
deep
brown
color
and
has
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
all
malt
chocolate
being
the
most
prominent
feature
its
taste
is
like
a
very
mellow
porter
with
a
spicy
hop
finish
a
little
more
bitter
than
the
bbcs
holiday
porter
a
very
nice
mellow
winter
beer
nothing
special
but
a
very
solid
beer
drinkable
very
good
for
a
winter
warmer
typically
i
can
not
do
too
many
as
winter
seasonals
tend
to
bombard
the
senses
with
many
scents
and
flavors
a
well
done
if
somewhat
understated
beer
appearance
is
similar
to
a
porter
with
a
very
dark
amber
color
to
it
a
very
clear
roasted
aroma
to
it
which
is
followed
by
the
same
roasted
taste
barley
chocolate
coffee
etc
great
mouthfeel
accompanied
by
a
slightly
bitter
malty
aftertaste
on
the
way
down
it
would
be
nice
if
it
were
a
little
more
potent
especially
since
it
is
classified
as
a
winter
warmer
i
would
peg
it
as
a
porter
as
opposed
to
the
strong
ales
i
think
of
as
winter
warmers
a
darn
nice
porter
at
that
if
it
was
available
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
winter
this
is
very
close
to
a
porter
not
an
olde
ale
as
expected
and
if
this
is
spiced
im
sure
not
tasting
it
a
solid
brew
from
a
very
good
brewery
all
their
brews
have
impressed
me
and
this
one
is
another
testament
to
their
skill
thanks
to
garymuchow
for
letting
me
try
this
one
dark
reddish
brown
body
was
clear
and
porterish
and
the
head
very
small
and
fleeting
the
smell
was
that
of
powdered
cocoa
roasted
and
burnt
grains
and
faint
grassy
hops
the
taste
was
as
anticipated
with
chocolate
weak
coffee
dark
skinned
fruits
brown
sugar
and
roasted
cracked
grains
mouthfeel
was
mediumthin
and
the
aftertaste
was
slightly
sticky
a
decent
porter
released
for
the
season
where
it
is
appropriate
quite
drinkable
its
a
fairly
light
beer
and
could
definately
be
a
nice
winter
session
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
fine
and
the
carbonation
level
seemed
well
suited
to
this
beer
one
was
enough
for
me
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
the
winter
ale
my
first
thought
was
along
the
lines
of
a
watery
porter
as
i
took
time
with
this
beer
i
grew
to
its
mild
likeing
not
a
heavy
over
spiced
high
abv
but
rather
a
thin
bodied
easy
winter
drinker
it
poured
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
fair
tan
head
with
good
lace
the
aroma
was
spice
pine
with
hints
of
malt
the
taste
also
carries
the
same
trends
with
more
spice
raisin
and
chocolate
malt
overall
a
nice
easy
winter
anytime
drink
with
a
thinner
than
normal
body
for
a
winter
warmer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
could
you
some
more
body
on
this
one
however
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
this
would
definetly
be
a
good
winter
session
brew
worth
a
try
i
really
like
this
brew
its
actually
the
one
that
finally
got
me
into
drinking
craft
beer
last
winter
this
ones
sure
too
warm
the
soul
on
a
howling
winter
night
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
of
tan
head
over
the
reddish
mahogany
brew
head
hangs
around
for
awhile
and
lacing
is
excellent
aroma
is
mainly
dark
malts
taste
is
also
darker
malts
mainly
caramel
i
think
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
for
added
enjoyment
mouthfeel
is
good
albeit
a
bit
thinseeming
drinkability
is
enhanced
by
the
somewhat
thin
body
and
the
malty
flavor
keeps
me
wanting
more
not
sure
how
much
of
a
wamer
during
the
winter
this
is
but
i
like
it
as
a
brew
and
thats
what
counts
a
brilliant
winter
drink
with
somewhat
of
a
guinness
mouthfeel
lingering
roastiness
will
keep
you
warm
on
a
winter
night
and
this
one
even
survived
with
flying
colors
into
the
hot
summer
months
gooey
malt
flavors
ripe
juicy
plum
caramelized
sugars
allspice
moderate
bitterness
a
dark
roasted
ale
certainly
short
of
a
stout
or
porter
but
lacking
the
extreme
though
good
spiciness
of
some
other
christmas
or
winter
ales
thanks
crjm
drinkability
is
very
love
to
get
this
one

malts
with
slight
fruitiness
hops
are
minimal
but
do
the
job
i
wouldnt
mind
it
if
summit
beefed
this
up
a
touch
it
might
really
help
it
gain
some
complexity
creamy
medium
bodied
and
not
a
bad
session
winter
ale
looks
darker
than
i
remembered
it
almost
looks
like
a
stout
with
its
black
opacity
this
is
a
very
heavily
spiced
beer
which
makes
me
wonder
why
it
isnt
in
the
herbedspiced
beer
category
it
tastes
strongly
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
in
fact
they
pretty
much
dominate
this
beer
covers
up
any
traces
of
alcohol
or
hops
i
dont
know
if
that
is
a
good
thing
not
a
beer
to
session
would
make
you
feel
sick
to
your
stomache
in
no
time
it
would
be
good
on
a
cold
winter
night
though
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
warming
scotch
whiskylike
alcoholic
malts
and
the
earthy
organic
peat
malt
feel
in
the
ending
that
this
winter
ale
has
very
nice
lovers
of
single
malt
whisky
should
try
this
one
cheers
joe
poured
darkish
brown
with
red
hues
and
a
moderate
tan
head
not
quite
opaque
but
very
dark
in
the
glass
really
very
little
aroma
at
all
neither
good
nor
bad
just
not
there
a
substantial
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
and
oddly
delicate
spicy
taste
makes
up
for
the
lack
of
aroma
though
nicely
carbonated
this
is
an
easy
drinking
winter
brew
that
i
found
friendly
even
if
i
didnt
fall
in
love
with
it

nutty

bready

flavors
medium
body
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
decent
winter
brew
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
the
sample
tastes
of
orange
and
piney
hops
with
a
chalky
aftertaste
im
not
quite
sure
what
it
is
but
something
didnt
quite
fit
together
in
this
beer
the
beer
is
rather
thin
and
perhaps
i
was
expecting
something
else
from
a
winterold
ale
and
something
unknown
that
i
cant
quite
describe
smell
roasty
and
sweet
quiet
coffee
and
heavy
caramel
taste
is
toasted
slightly
sweet
at
first
then
bitter
with
hints
of
chocolate
but
always
mellow
never
rich
followed
by
a
nice
coffee
aftertaste
that
lingers
but
isnt
overpowering
very
smooth
not
overly
thick
toasted
but
not
all
that
bitter
ah
winter
in
minnesota
cold
weather
black
ice
snow
and
more
cold
weather
luckily
we
have
some
solidly
enjoyable
winter
brews
available
and
summit
winter
ale
is
no
exception
color
is
dark
and
inviting
with
a
nice
creamy
head
with
acceptable
retention
smell
is
of
roasty
malt
with
a
touch
sweetness
taste
is
an
enjoyable
slight
spicyness
on
an
ample
bed
of
malt
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
overt
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
winter
and
i
look
forward
to
it
each
year
pours
a
clear
rubytinted
mahogany
beneath
a
short
lid
of
creamy
off
white
foam
that
drops
shortly
but
maintains
a
wide
collar
whispy
surface
covering
and
leaves
some
craggy
streaks
and
spots
of
lace
with
each
sip
the
nose
is
limited
but
clean
and
it
offers
a
touch
of
roastiness
above
some
mild
grainy
malt
the
body
is
decidedly
medium
and
its
very
fine
restrained
carbonation
leaves
it
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
in
fact
its
very
similar
to
a
enginepulled
cask
ale
or
a
nitropour
it
really
needs
to
warm
a
bit
before
its
flavors
come
out
but
when
they
do
some
dark
caramel
with
an
almost
burntsugar
edge
and
some
subtle
chocolatey
notes
join
with
its
mild
roastiness
in
the
flavor
a
touch
of
fruitiness
and
some
sublime
spice
lend
a
bit
of
additional
character
and
its
firm
bitterness
also
combines
with
its
roastiness
to
leave
it
dry
in
the
finish
quite
interesting
its
very
much
like
a
blend
of
a
toneddown
stout
and
some
richly
malty
caramelish
ale
very
nice
taste
really
isnt
that
great
dont
get
me
wrong
its
good
it
tastes
like
quality
but
nothing
really
stands
out
like
the
other
winter
ales
i
have
had
this
season
it
is
mild
and
drinkable
but
lacks
character
this
might
be
the
last
winter
ale
ill
buy
i
would
write
the
smell
off
as
an
anomoly
but
i
had
the
same
impression
last
year
must
not
be
that
bad
i
bought
it
again
dark
mahogany
hue
with
shinny
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
of
the
pint
glass
light
brunette
head
served
about
a
finger
in
height
very
sturdy
retention
a
good
amount
of
lacing
was
produced
even
if
it
was
unorganized
as
i
sipped
away
to
the
eye
it
is
a
dark
mysterious
looking
beverage
appealing
the
nose
is
very
pleasant
with
dark
yet
restrained
fruits
upfront
quickly
followed
by
light
butterscotch
and
chocolate
straightforward
maltiness
fairly
good
potency
sparks
the
invitation
the
depth
on
the
tongue
is
solid
with
a
pleasant
chocolate
maltiness
found
upfront
and
then
a
delicious
hoppy
bitterness
is
introduced
in
the
middle
yummy
the
finish
has
a
lovely
buttery
english
old
ale
twist
on
the
end
the
palate
is
respectable
and
very
enjoyable
to
quaff
however
it
failed
to
blow
me
away
the
carbonation
is
low
which
would
work
better
if
the
body
were
a
little
fuller
still
worth
trying
if
you
have
not
ill
gladly
drink
it
again
this
was
my
first
nebraska

is
a

thin

out
get
rid
of
the
harsh

and
i
might
be
interested
in
it
again
was
hoping
they
changed
this
one
much
like
the

i
always
skip

for
this

this

it

i
think
there
are
better

out
there
perhaps
this
would
make
a
nice
cross
over
or

beer
for
someone
having
the
style
for
the

another

never

a

in
my
life
this
has
kept
very
well
as
i
was
watching
the
thunderstorms
pass
i
enjoyed
2
bottles
and
i
must
say
really
enjoyed
i
was
surprised
at
how
dark
and
beautifully
it
poured
a
firm
but
not
longlasting

teased
me
with

i
was
about

tickled
with

down

i
will
savor
the
last
4
bottles
and
hope
that
last
6

i
saw
at

will
still
be

warming
and
pretty
dry
especially
in
the
middle
some
lingering
dark
fruit
wood
though
dark
brown
almost
purple
color
with
one
and
a
half
finger
head
smells
delicious
mostly
malt
fig
brown
sugar
but
it
has
a
tremendous
amount
of
piney
and
floral
hops
to
balance
it
out
the
flavor
is
great
a
lot
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
just
the
perfect
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
edges
even
better
than
i
remembered
kind
of
thin
especially
for
a
7
2
abv
but
decent
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
with
some
kind
of
spice
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
o
pretty
decent
malty
winter
beer
pretty
good
flavors
come
through
it
was
a
very
nice
winter
beer
id
have
it
again
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
goto
choice
for
a
winter
warmer
great
nuttiness
fruitcake
like
fruitiness
and
a
spicy
warmth
to
it
couple
with
a
great
thick
body
and
smooth
finish
make
this
an
outstanding
choice
poured
a
rich
dark
red
with
a
thin
white
head
and
thin
lacing
smells
of
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
tastes
as
it
smells
with
a
wonderful
warming
from
the
alcohol
the
hops
and
alcohol
balance
out
the
strong
malt
backbone
to
create
a
very
balanced
and
very
delicious
ale
definitely
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
available
especially
for
the
price
interesting
winter
warmer
glad
to
try
it
mouth
decent
body
maybe
a
little
on
the
thin
side
medium
carb
overall
a
winter
warmer
i
can
appreciate
not
overspiced
and
not
so
sweet
you
have
to
chase
it
with
insulin
delightfully
chewy
drives
imho
mad
elf
back
into
the
underbrush
not
a
bad
warmer
i
like
the
lack
of
big
spice
flavors
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
best
by
22813
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
with
a
one
inch
off
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
attractive
lace
smell
is
caramel
biscuit
some
pine
tangerine
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
nutmeg
taste
surprises
with
a
hit
of
chocolate
and
some
grapefruit
up
front
and
the
other
flavors
blend
in
through
out
body
is
medium
plenty
of
life
not
dry
and
very
drinkable
this
is
really
good
and
different
another
beer
i
will
be
drinking
during
the
holiday
season
the
taste
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
is
satisfying
rich
and
makes
you
glad
its
a
holiday
full
sail
hats
off
to
you
im
a
fan
of
your
beers
but
this
one
is
really
outstanding
the
best
youve
made
yet
nothing
really
good
to
say
about
this
beer
typical
taste
that
is
far
from
a
winter
ale
for
the
most
part
taste
like
an
oktoberfest
starting
to
wonder
if
the
7
2
abv
is
really
true
i
drank
6
of
them
in
a
3
hour
period
and
felt
no
more
of
a
kick
then
if
i
drank
6
5
0
brews
not
impressed
even
with
the
90
days
availabilitytheme
on
the
label
one
of
the
reasons
i
bought
it
and
never
will
again
not
trying
to
be
a
sour
puss
but
this
brew
is
far
from
a
solid
brew
that
deserves
top
ratings
i
have
had
way
better
rjt
the
verdict
pretty
good
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
and
not
too
spicy
like
many
winter
warmers
tend
to
be
a
solid
brew
like
most
of
full
sails
offerings
o
a
ton
of
hop
character
on
top
of
a
stodgy
malt
body
it
comes
on
a
bit
strong
but
as
a
winter
beer
it
works
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
itll
warm
your
cockles
on
a
cold
winter
day
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
small
head
quickly
fades
leaving
good
lacing
and
a
thin
cap
which
persists
very
dark
brown
with
rubychestnut
notes
when
held
to
light
nose
sweet
and
toasted
malt
chocolate
notes
actually
very
nice
tastes
of
sugary
and
burnt
malt
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
mouth
is
nicely
chewy
viscous
quenching
and
smooth
very
complementary
to
flavor
profile
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
winter
ales
but
this
one
is
quite
tasty
as
a
bonus
one
of
my
nonbeer
friends
really
liked
this
one
probably
because
of
the
sweet
chocolate
flavor
profile
would
definitely
seek
out
again
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
christmaswinter
ale
a
good
standard
but
still
solid
strangely
enough
its
still
wintery
in
florida
and
this
has
four
more
days
until
its
best
by
date
wassail
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
large
head
that
laces
wonderfully
the
aroma
is
muddled
providing
a
nondescript
maltiness
and
spiciness
the
taste
fares
better
though
offering
a
much
more
rich
malt
experience
along
with
a
touch
of
nuttiness
that
goes
very
well
with
the
spices
malty
bitterness
lingers
through
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
it
goes
down
easily
without
highlight
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
overall
its
a
good
winter
warmer
thats
cheap
overall
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
a
very
enjoyable
wintery
brew
lacking
in
spice
and
sweet
which
makes
me
happy
pours
really
dark
brown
with
a
faint
orangey
glow
inch
of
fading
khaki
head
on
top
the
aroma
is
really
malt
forward
dark
and
well
toasted
maybe
some
unmalted
barley
in
here
too
its
got
that
roasty
bitter
aromatic
flavor
is
more
balanced
than
the
nose
less
bitter
than
expected
and
the
malts
take
on
more
of
a
breakfast
cake
character
molassas
without
the
sweetness
gentle
and
distinct
easily
on
of
the
better
full
sail
beers
ive
had
the
feel
works
too
really
lazy
carbonation
contributes
to
a
heavier
vibe
but
the
body
is
fairly
light
despite
its
color
slides
right
down
no
problem
sessionable
id
day
but
the
well
hidden
abv
might
sneak
up
on
you
after
a
few
either
way
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
a
slow
sipper
letting
it
come
up
to
room
temperature
to
let
the
full
malt
complexity
unfold
well
done
i
know
its
hard
to
resist
spicing
the
bejeezus
out
of
these
winter
seasonals
poured
into
a
16oz
goblet
a
nice
2
finger
dirty
white
foamy
head
on
pour
settled
down
to
1
finger
with
a
fair
amount
of
cling
color
was
a
very
dark
rich
brownish
red
with
a
bit
of
transparency
aroma
was
a
bit
sweet
up
front
then
shifted
to
a
bit
of
a
spicy
finish
hints
of
pepper
and
a
few
other
similar
aromas
flavor
was
initially
subtle
then
finished
with
a
bit
of
bite
started
off
creamy
and
smooth
then
picked
up
some
pepper
before
leaving
a
bitter
hops
flavor
in
the
mouth
felt
a
bit
off
in
the
mouth
coated
well
but
not
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
area
but
more
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
not
as
overpoweringly
spicy
as
some
but
with
enough
flavor
and
kick
to
stand
up
to
the
cold
not
sure
if
the
recipe
on
this
changes
every
year
or
not
but
this
is
the
2012
version
beautiful
nutty
brown
color
clear
and
has
small
bubbles
coming
up
from
bottom
entire
time
aromas
of
raisin
prune
and
dark
fruit
roasted
smell
too
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
leaves
a
nice
lace
on
glass
sweetness
strikes
first
touch
of
vanilla
and
i
get
a
hint
of
citrus
zest
spicy
flavors
follow
with
black
pepper
and
a
general
nuttiness
finish
is
a
roasted
coffee
bitterness
has
a
nice
warming
effect
and
a
sort
of
foamy
volume
to
it
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
ive
had
so
far
it
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
tan
head
it
decent
retention
and
beautiful
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
and
spicy
there
is
also
a
strong
pine
a
citrus
hop
presence
the
taste
is
malty
and
woodsy
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
finish
reveals
pine
and
coffee
there
is
light
carbonation
with
a
moderatelight
mouthfeel
it
is
lighter
in
flavor
than
most
other
winter
beers
and
it
is
incredibly
refreshing
in
a
season
dominated
by
thick
syruplike
brews
it
is
simply
outstanding
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
very
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
little
thick
but
the
taste
is
amazing
and
the
smell
wonderful
well
done
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
but
wow
this
beer
exceeded
all
expectations
as
soon
as
i
cracked
open
the
bottle
a
nice
aroma
of
sweet
malted
hops
hit
my
nose
upon
inspection
i
noticed
the
exact
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
lacing
the
beer
is
wonderfully
smooth
and
sweet
and
goes
down
exceptionally
smooth
a
very
worthy
effort
and
a
pleasant
surprise
a
very
enjoyable
winter
warmer
a
well
executed
hop
profiles
blends
seamlessly
into
a
great
dark
malt
profile
a
hefty
beer
perfect
for
the
cold
weather
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
ideal
winter
warmer
the
spices
are
noticeable
and
help
make
the
brew
warm
and
lively
but
they
are
in
balance
and
not
overbearing
it
is
also
easy
enough
to
drink
that
it
could
potentially
serve
as
a
session
beer
cheers
o
high
scoring
i
just
wish
i
could
pick
out
more
flavors
in
the
taste
that
would
elevate
it
to
a
very
good
instead
of
a
good
a
nice
malty
sipper
probably
better
at
a
slightly
warmer
temp
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
this
year
havent
had
many
of
the
winter
warmers
but
its
definately
got
alot
of
flavor
to
it
and
cant
go
wrong
being
7
2
abv
overall
a
really
good
beer
would
definitely
have
it
on
tap
if
i
could
find
it
even
for
a
darker
beer
it
still
has
a
lighter
ipa
taste
with
a
hint
of
caramel
maybe
overallgreat
beer
to
have
during
this
season
have
one
it
will
warm
you
right
up
cheers
o
a
malty
and
moderately
hoppy
beer
that
fits
the
bill
of
a
holiday
ale
in
my
house
having
no
fruit
nor
spice
and
a
good
hops
showing
i
want
a
bit
more
in
the
nose
from
the
hops
and
the
malt
but
then
it
would
almost
be
a
dark
ipa
its
a
great
looking
beer
dont
drink
this
one
to
cold
our
you
miss
the
best
parts
which
are
subtle
fruity
and
hops
flavors
omg
this
is
simply
excellent
i
am
also
one
that
judges
by
style
i
dont
compare
a
craft
against
adjunct
its
apples
to
apples
with
me
this
is
one
great
beer
period
i
had
mine
in
a
frosted
mug
the
beer
was
just
chilled
not
cold
and
the
first
drink
was
heaven
it
is
well
balanced
and
full
of
flavor
try
it
before
it
is
no
longer
availible
oda
solid
winter
warmer
i
enjoyed
the
rather
noticeable
hoppiness
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
in
my
opinion
might
try
it
again
next
winter
overall
i
like
this
one
a
lot
i
paid
1
50
for
this
bottle
and
will
get
another
before
the
season
ends
a
lackluster
head
and
scent
great
taste
the
7
2
is
greatly
masked
and
i
whizzed
through
the
bottle
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
ive
had
easy
to
drink
smooth
tasty
and
well
made
for
the
season
ill
have
to
bring
some
to
christmas
dinner
overall
definitely
glad
i
tried
this
one
overall
solid
winter
warmer
from
full
sail
roasted
malt
meets
an
assertive
grassy
hop
bitterness
i
can
see
myself
at
the
top
of
the
hill
ordering
this
beer
before
the
first
run
of
the
day
nice
job
full
sail
d
o
wow
that
is
good
i
do
not
regret
the
6pack
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thin
foam
that
settles
on
top
the
color
turns
to
red
quickly
it
has
a
great
nutty
caramely
aroma
and
with
a
taste
to
match
rich
with
a
strong
taste
of
candied
walnuts
and
a
pleasing
foamy
and
just
a
bit
bitter
finish
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
that
i
probably
wont
revisit
but
i
did
enjoy
it
till
the
last
drop
o
here
we
go
a
wassailing
along
thats
all
i
know
anyways
this
is
a
well
rounded
winter
warmer
tons
of
malt
and
spicy
booze
and
hops
to
balance
it
out
once
warned
it
transforms
to
a
much
more
aggressive
warmer
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
a
cold
evening
hayride
cheers
russet

just
the
way
i
like
my
winter
warmers
no
spices
rich
complex
flavors
in
a
small
enough
beer
that
i
can
drink
a
pint
or
two
ridiculous
value
at
6
75sixer
well
worth
giving
this
winter
warmer
a
try
i
wish
the
fsb
website
had
more
details
on
the
recipie
id
really
like
to
know
specifically
what
went
into
this
divine
brew
tried
this
last
year
and
was
highly
ambivalent
but
this
years
batch
is
really
memorable
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
amber
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
light
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
dark
dried
fruit
lightly
vegetal
hops
flavor
dominated
by
sweet
bready
malt
and
winter
spices
particularly
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
finishes
with
hop
and
spice
bitterness
with
the
spicing
nicely
balanced
with
the
bitterness
somewhat
subdued
flavor
but
overall
nicely
balanced
and
pleasant
to
drink
medium
bodied
spicing
is
great
for
a
wassail
and
ill
grab
another
one
of
these
during
the
holidays
overall
this
winter
warmer
held
up
nice
for
the
months
it
been
on
the
shelf
i
would
be
curious
to
try
this
again
fresh
overall
a
decent
seasonal
that
is
very
drinkable
the
flavours
are
somewhat
bold
but
the
beer
isnt
cloying
id
pick
this
one
up
again
overal
the
tast
alone
is
somthing
ill
buy
this
again
for
however
the
unique
mouth
feel
is
somthing
worth
buying
just
for
the
sensation
one
time
ive
never
had
a
mouthfeel
beer
like
this
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
best
by
22312
on
the
back
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
smallish
tan
head
which
has
good
retention
the
smells
are
of
spices
caramel
other
malts
no
hops
by
now
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
good
lots
of
malts
some
spices
a
definite
alcohol
presence
o
i
dont
know
if
this
is
what
a
true
wassail
is
supposed
to
be
like
but
this
just
does
not
agree
with
me
poured
into
a
wine
glass
a
deep
and
glowing
mahogany
lurks
beneath
an
offwhite
head
aroma
is
of
a
cool
and
mildly
peppermint
spiced
candy
dark
fruit
perhaps
prune
rides
sweetly
along
a
complementary
deep
toasted
malt
blend
backbone
robust
but
smooth
body
with
a
warming
feel
in
the
finish
firstly
i
am
unexperienced
tasting
this
style
this
brew
poured
a
deep
brown
mahogany
has
some
ruby
tints
head
does
not
retain
scent
is
earthy
woody
some
fruit
as
well
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
hoppy
and
bitter
some
bitter
fruit
rind
can
be
detected
mellows
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
bitter
but
pleasantly
so
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
as
described
by
full
sail
this
beer
pours
a
mahogany
color
head
is
light
tan
very
thick
dense
good
retention
as
i
drink
it
leaves
some
very
nice
lacing
body
of
the
beer
is
too
thick
to
really
see
into
very
pretty
beer
smell
is
of
floral
hops
and
a
little
caramel
malt
very
crisp
clean
smell
taste
starts
with
a
bit
of
earthy
bitterness
then
i
get
some
of
the
more
roasty
malts
ends
with
an
piney
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
light
sweetness
once
it
has
really
left
the
tongue
maybe
a
little
bit
of
a
citric
hop
in
there
or
something
i
havent
let
this
warm
up
too
much
yet
but
i
have
not
yet
detected
any
alcohol
taste
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
heavy
perfect
mouthfeel
when
designing
a
winter
warmer
for
hop
lovers
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
next
winter
its
a
fantastic
nightcap
for
the
beer
lover
who
doesnt
want
to
drink
a
7
22oz
bottle
well
done
full
sail
onot
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
memorable
one
i
like
it
but
wouldnt
want
a
6er
too
many
other
good
better
beers
out
there
for
me
solid
average
beer
great
balance
carbonation
color
complexity
cannot
detect
the
7
in
any
way
taste
is
malty
with
some
light
hop
bitterness
doesnt
have
a
particular
flavor
just
malty
without
the
winter
spice
or
sugar
i
expected
light
medium
body
overall
a
decent
beer
but
better
examples
of
the
style
exist
this
is
the
2011
version
at
6
5
abv
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
it
has
a
nice
hopiness
to
it
but
also
has
a
creamy
taste
to
it
like
a
stout
in
the
smell
i
get
spices
and
hops
maybe
some
caramel
the
taste
is
really
nice
and
i
really
get
some
nice
breadiness
and
then
a
nice
smooth
hop
aftertaste
overall
this
is
one
i
would
drink
every
winter
and
i
will
look
for
it
in
the
future
o
overall
this
beer
looks
and
feels
great
but
the
hops
were
a
bit
too
much
for
me
given
the
style
not
bad
though
thebeeralmanac
com
overall
45
on
all
counts
delicious
but
if
your
not
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppy
beer
this
is
not
your
drink
i
thought
full
sail
was
supposed
to
be
good
this
is
meh
grabbed
a
single
at
princetons
liquors
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sharp
with
alcohol
but
theres
also
a
pleasant
mix
of
banana
and
date
and
brown
bready
malt
i
really
like
the
roasty
edge
to
the
flavor
it
blends
in
with
the
dark
fruit
and
crusty
cocoa
barley
flavor
for
a
wonderfullybalanced
american
take
on
the
style
i
had
a
deschutes
jubelale
the
night
before
and
prefer
this
winter
warmer
despite
the
lower
hoping
rate
great
beer
price

pours
a
clear
super
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasty
malt
and
some
caramel
aromas
taste
is
of
toasty
malt
caramel
and
some
dry
spice
flavors
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
spice
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
but
nothing
all
that
great
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
the
spice
bitterness
that
this
beer
leaves
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
with
medium
but
sharp
carbonation
not
a
fan
of
the
spiced
winter
warmers
so
this
is
a
nice
departure
will
pick
this
one
up
again
overall
this
beer
is
very
close
to
being
excellent
if
the
maltiness
and
hoppiness
would
meld
just
a
little
bit
more
i
would
get
it
regularly
though
if
it
were
available
closer
to
me
full
sail
wassail
is
a
wonderfully
clear
dark
copper
ale
that
has
a
dense
bubbly
light
khaki
head
that
leaves
solid
sheets
on
the
glass
it
smells
fruity
and
medicinal
with
hints
of
cherry
and
mint
theres
a
grassy
whiff
to
it
its
thick
and
fluffy
and
the
finish
is
kind
of
like
sand
paper
on
your
tongue
it
tastes
hot
and
bitter
there
are
notes
of
orange
and
wood
with
the
bitterness
of
furniture
polish
to
shine
up
the
flavor
it
certainly
has
zazzle
this
is
a
very
aggressive
beer
and
sometimes
it
comes
off
as
rude
its
powerful
and
untamed
o
a
decent
beer
the
nice
balance
of
roast
with
citrus
character
makes
me
keep
drinking
this
has
the
appearance
of
foamy
soda
very
bubbly
and
caramelbrown
colored
not
much
aroma
comes
through
the
flavor
is
all
out
of
wack
theres
a
harsh
clove
taste
to
it
that
dominates
and
a
sharp
finish
it
manages
to
be
bitter
without
any
hoppiness
next
year
ill
pass
endearing
as
an
ale
that
exhibits
mostly
the
flavors
of
english
strong
ales
or
younger
old
ales
and
that
of
brown
ales
and
american
strong
ales
a
blend
thats
all
classy
experimental
and
ecclectic
o
not
bad
i
had
this
beer
a
few
weeks
ago
and
thought
it
was
a
complete
failure
i
decided
to
give
it
another
try
im
glad
i
did
while
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
great
i
do
think
its
a
decent
winter
ale
to
have
when
you
want
to
grab
a
sixer
of
something
i
dont
see
myself
grabbing
this
beer
a
third
time
though
a
dry
toasty
cocoa
and
mildly
roasted
malt
flavor
leads
to
a
slight
pine
note
from
the
hops
with
a
nice
flavor
accenting
the
mild
caramel
from
the
malt
which
segues
into
a
dark
cherry
note
and
the
subtle
dried
fruit
tinges
as
hinted
at
by
the
nose
there
is
some
yeast
flavor
with
the
nice
dry
toasted
malt
and
mild
coffeelike
tinges
i
get
a
light
brown
sugar
compliment
in
the
finish
with
subtle
alcohol
flavors
that
round
out
the
taste
overall
i
liked
having
this
again
but
my
first
review
of
it
i
enjy
the
overall
high
drinkability
for
a
strong
brown
spicy
ale
this
is
perfect
for
late
fallwinter
drinking
i
would
buy
this
again
the
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
when
something
slushy
like
jello
gets
sucked
through
a
straw
overall
not
a
bad
beer
from
this
brewery
i
think
i
have
an
imperial
in
my
stash
but
this
was
a
good
one
to
get
me
acquainted
with
this
brewery
from
or
will
be
looking
for
more
of
this
in
the
future
i
love
this
beer
i
had
to
hold
it
up
to
the
window
to
peek
through
the
beer
the
view
of
my
neighborhood
seemed
to
be
filtered
by
the
sepia
setting
on
my
camera
perfect
lacing
i
wish
i
could
comment
more
on
the
smell
but
my
nose
is
stuffed
up
the
taste
was
wonderful
angels
at
a
track
meet
stomping
all
over
my
tastebuds
my
mind
chased
the
bitter
smokey
sweet
and
malty
tastes
swirling
in
my
mouth
cave
each
swallow
is
like
a
curtain
opening
down
my
throat
with
exciting
sensations
damn
i
love
this
beer
from
the
bottle
stamped
0403121422fl
sampled
on
december
1
2011
the
pour
is
a
handsome
looking
dark
mahogany
amber
with
a
silky
lasting
head
malts
are
clearly
on
the
nose
with
a
bread
and
biscuit
lining
and
mellow
hop
character
i
found
the
body
to
be
about
medium
but
also
rather
acidic
or
astringent
sweet
at
first
and
then
bitter
after
that
when
tasting
it
the
hop
ending
tends
to
be
almost
dry
fairly
well
balanced
t
have
to
say
im
usually
not
very
impressed
by
full
sail
but
this
ones
pretty
good
a
base
of
caramel
toffee
and
toasted
malt
with
a
strong
backbone
of
pine
hops
that
grow
in
bitterness
as
the
beer
warms
id
have
this
one
again
o
very
good
brew
been
trying
all
the
full
sail
i
can
recently
have
yet
to
be
dissappointed
taste
of
wood
grilled
cherries
caramel
with
a
hint
of
chestnut
much
lighter
than
the
pour
suggests
overall
a
very
drinkable
high
abv
winter
warmer
but
seems
to
be
lacking
the
big
wow
factor
clear
dark
chestnut
hue
under
a
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
spiced
lightly
nutty
herbal
hop
aroma
caramel
and
spice
sweetness
balanced
with
a
solid
earthypiney
hop
presence
fruity
through
the
middle
finishing
dryish
and
lightly
bitter
solid
creamy
body
with
a
bit
of
tartness
somewhat
holidayesque
without
any
overbearing
spice
pretty
good
definitely
a
fine
choice
for
a
winter
warming
session
beer
on
the
whole
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
very
good
winter
warmer
i
feel
it
is
more
underrated
than
it
should
be
worth
a
try
if
you
like
winter
warmers
you
wont
be
disappointed
o
this
is
a
solid
winter
warmer
that
straddles
the
line
between
traditional
and
new
world
takes
on
the
style
save
this
one
for
after
dinner
on
a
snowy
night
not
bad
at
all
in
fact
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
gateway
to
traditional
english
warmers
o
a
very
tasty
brew
and
a
should
try
for
fans
of
the
style
very
interesting
that
this
is
not
brewed
with
any
holiday
spices
but
manages
to
present
all
these
holiday
flavors
if
you
get
a
six
pack
and
have
the
time
for
this
try
letting
one
of
the
bottles
warm
up
for
twenty
minutes
or
so
before
pouring
i
really
think
this
beer
opens
up
with
a
little
warmth
also
dont
use
a
pint
glass
this
beer
deserves
something
that
will
open
up
the
aroma
on
a
side
note
i
just
started
homebrewing
and
my
first
batch
was
a
full
sail
wassail
clone
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
it
compares
ok
try
this
o
this
is
one
of
many
reasons
for
which
winter
is
my
favorite
season
for
beer
shopping
a
solid
winter
ale
one
of
the
classic
pnw
winter
warmers
this
is
a
malt
centric
beer
that
shines
a
red
brown
in
the
glass
the
beer
has
a
long
finish
and
though
the
hops
are
there
it
is
the
malt
that
really
anchors
the
taste
i
do
like
jubelale
better
but
this
is
still
a
great
xmas
beer
that
at
7
can
be
a
regular
part
of
the
holiday
beer
fridge
o
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wont
stock
in
the
house
again
probably
the
appearance
turned
out
to
be
wonderful
the
lacing
followed
me
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
while
it
was
a
tiny
bit
patchy
it
was
still
very
present
and
not
weak
like
some
patchy
lacing
is
the
head
didnt
last
forever
but
it
had
pretty
good
retention
and
it
looked
really
nice
a
pillowy
when
it
was
poured
on
top
of
all
of
that
it
had
a
nice
looking
body
the
only
reasons
this
beer
didnt
look
perfect
was
because
the
lacing
was
a
little
bit
patchy
and
the
head
didnt
last
forever
but
whatever
its
still
a
great
looking
beer
overallnot
a
tasty
beer
dont
buy
it
pretty
unremarkable
but
quite
drinkable
more
of
a
regular
amber
with
some
bark
in
the
flavor
i
always
look
forward
to
the
holiday
beers
but
i
prefer
ones
with
a
distinctive
roast
malt
or
a
zippy
hop
to
go
with
the
sweetness
but
keep
the
cinnamon
thanks
d
a
very
good
warmer
that
only
shows
its
abv
when
it
needs
to
overall
had
the
burnt
malt
flavor
and
carbonation
not
been
as
strong
i
wouldve
loved
this
beer
it
does
start
out
promising
but
in
the
end
i
felt
disappointed
and
felt
that
this
couldve
been
better
there
are
better
winter
warmers
out
there
than
this
o
enjoyable
beer
i
had
pretty
average
expectations
for
this
and
came
out
really
pleasantly
surprised
it
may
just
be
that
i
like
the
winter
warmer
style
ale
quite
a
lot
d
a
very
nice
smooth
drinking
winter
warmer
that
is
not
over
the
top
but
still
a
very
good
one
this
is
a
really
drinkable
winter
warmer
there
are
spices
present
but
not
at
all
overpowering
i
would
excitedly
drink
this
again
overall
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
but
pretty
onedimensional
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
ever
had
from
full
sail
it
pours
a
ver
dark
almost
black
color
and
looks
very
enjoyable
the
smell
is
very
nice
too
it
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
roastedness
the
taste
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
for
some
reason
it
reminds
me
of
a
session
black
lager
it
has
a
nice
roasted
taste
with
a
bunch
of
flavor
i
love
the
lingering
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
not
great
it
has
some
carbonation
to
the
beer
but
nothing
special
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
have
never
had
it
before
today
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
will
be
buying
this
again
a
nice
malty
ale
with
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
good
o
a
litle
all
over
the
place
but
a
pretty
solid
brew
nice
work
full
sail
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
opaque
brown
color
nose
is
burnt
malts
and
flavor
has
hints
of

bitterness

sweetness
toffee
a
balanced
beer
that
allows
both
sides
of
the
spectrum
to
shine
alcohol
definitely
is
warming
not
as
smooth
as
most
winter
warmers
but
i
appreciate
the
hops
and
bitter
bite
to
it
some
nutmeg
mild
flow
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
like
i
said
pretty
complex
especially
for
full
sail
these
days
o
a
very
well
balanced
winter
warmer
the
hops
and
malts
are
in
perfect
balance
to
make
this
beer
smooth
and
only
slightly
bitter
i
could
drink
this
all
winter
long
even
though
this
is
summer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
nice
creamy
off
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
semi
sweet
and
toasted
malts
with

is
toasted

slight
sweetness
toffee
dark
fruit
with
a
slight

bitterness
at
the
finish
all
of
these
tastes
came
together
well
for
me
mouthfeel
a
nice
medium
with
good
carbination
until
the
end
well
done
and
will
have
more
you
should
give
it
a
try
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
the
visual
consistency
of
peach
fruit
chocolate
and
mildly
spicey
aromas
distinct
bitterness
from
the
pacific
northwestern
that
gets
more
bitter
as
it
warms
and
yields
more
citrus
orange
taste
as
wll
as
mace
and
nutmeg
mouthfeel
consistency
of
fruit
spider
lace
left
in
the
glass
bottle
from
premier
a
sipper
o
this
was
a
nice
surprise
to
find
in
maryland
it
was
towards
its
expiration
date
but
i
found
the
flavors
pronounced
and
not
lacking
at
all
the
malts
were
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
and
those
hops
were
a
nice
bright
addition
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
toffee
malt
with
some
holiday
spices
mainly
nutmeg
but
a
few
other
spices
are
mixed
in
as
well
the
flavor
is
full
of
holiday
spices
and
caramel
as
well
as
quite
a
bit
of
grassy
and
piney
hops
this
is
definitely
a
highlyhopped
winter
warmer
the
alcohol
is
also
present
and
seems
like
it
is
higher
than
7
percent
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
bad
i
like
it
and
would
enjoy
a
6
pack
i
have
to
imagine
it
would
have
more
hop
aroma
when
it
was
younger
but
it
has
a
nice
balance
as
it
is
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
of
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
drinkable
feel
to
it
it
goes
down
well
and
would
go
at
any
time
of
year
not
just
for
winter
honestly
i
opened
this
beer
thinking
that
i
would
drink
half
of
it
and
use
the
other
half
as
a
marinade
because
i
expected
something
heavily
spiced
that
did
not
happen
i
drank
the
whole
thing
argentinians
use
dry
rub
anyway
drinks
easy
i
felt
this
one
in
my
cheeks
long
before
i
wanted
to
stop
drinking
perfect
for
a
cold
night
and
not
bad
for
a
warm
one
either
pairs
well
with
all
manner
of
food
but
in
particular
id
say
it
holds
up
well
to
heartier
entrees
richer
foods
and
even
bittersweet
chocolates
and
lighter
desserts
an
easy
winter
warmer
would
of
potentially
enjoyed
more
traditional
spices
but
that
often
doesnt
end
well
the
beer
pours
a
chestnut
brown
elixir
with
a
nice
creamy
cap
of
foam
the
foam
left
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
the

there

there
one
of
the
more
interesting
tasting
beers
ive
ever
tried
though
malty
and
creamy
up
front
but
on
the
back
side
its
hoppy
and
bitter
its
a
malty
beer
with
a
bite
and
that
is
very
interesting
to
me
i
definitely
enjoy
the
polarity
of
the
two
flavors
together
let
it
warm
up
and
the
complexities
show
through
more
intensly

wouldnt

this

would

d

this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
was
the
first
that
ive
had
from
full
sail
and
i
am
quite
impressed
i
have
had
several
of
these
without
tiring
of
it
but
not
interesting
enough
to
keep
going
through
a
six
pack
over
an
evening
good
offering
for
the
season
its
a
pretty
tasty
ww
but
a
bit
weak
in
many
parts
and
a
tinge
medicinal
in
the
flavor
great
smooth
sipper
though
i
would
probably
try
another
bottle
of
this
sometime
down
the
line
im
not
going
to
lie
as
for
drinkability
im
not
as
into
this
as
anchors
or
even
sierra
nevadas
christmas
offerings
this
year
but
it
is
still
very
drinkable
to
this
lass
i
was
very
surprised
at
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
was
afraid
the
spiciness
would
be
overwhelming
but
this
goes
down
smooth
as
the
aforementioned
silk
as
the
label
says
ridiculously
tasty
and
at
7
0
abv
these
could
sneak
up
on
you
quick
i
would
love
to
relax
in
front
of
the
fire
after
a
good
meal
and
melt
into
a
few
of
these
i
look
forward
to
more
winter
warmer
offerings
but
will
seek
wassail
out
every
year
now
i
also
think
i
will
have
to
revisit
the
other
beers
of
this
brewery
soon
an
ok
beer
but
not
the
best
of
the
winter
warmer
beer
class
on
the
bitter
end
of
the
spectrum
this
probably
will
improve
with
a
bit
of
aging
if
you
want
a
bitter
beer
with
winter
warmer
features
added
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
considering
the
style
which
is
not
normally
one
of
my
favorites
nice
effort
from

this
beer

you

of

it
was
a

chewy
and
left
a
tingling
on
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
a
very
good
winter
warmer
and
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
to
enjoy
d
this
6pack
was
enough
of
an
experience
at
least
for
this
season
its
not
an
every
day
beer
and
its
not
a
beer
that
you
want
to
have
several
of
in
an
evening
not
bad

youre
in
the

for
it

have
to
admit
the
name
had
me
thinking
cider
not
winter
warmer
but
i
adjusted
i
buy
at

a
few
of
these
every

and
am
never
disappointed
solid
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
typically
dont

any
of

of

restrained
at

a
solid
and
drinkable
example
of
the
style

kicks
the
butt
of
other
more
celebrated
examples
d
this
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
but
it
isnt
outstanding
honestly
i
expected
more
from
full
sails
winter
brew
better
than
most
but
could
be
better
d
notes
this
is
one
assertive
brew
it
has
the
unique
characteristic
of
being
both
very
assertive
in
hops
as
well
as
a
big
malt
flavor
as
well
that
said
its
not
overdone
and
is
simply
an
awesome
all
around
beer
too
damn
drinkable
for
words
even
considering
its
high
abv
this
is
essentially
a
dark
ipa
and
the
very
complex
flavors
of
this
brew
are
a
sheer
joy
to
let
dance
on
your
tongue
one
of
my
top
seasonal
winter
beers
drinkability
for
the
most
part
other
than
vesuvius
im
a
full
sail
fan
the
nose
is
a
huge
disappointment
but
the
taste
isnt
bad
it
becomes
a
little
much
after
a
while
though
because
it
is
fairly
cloying
a
bit
more
hop
or
full
fermentation
may
reduce
this
what
do
i
know
and
make
it
a
bit
more
enjoyable
a
decent
beer
not
earth
shattering
but
solid
while
i
dont
regret
finally
trying
it
i
dont
feel
ive
missed
anything
by
not
hitting
it
before
this
would
be
a
decent
winter
ale
for
people
not
used
to
them
someone
looking
for
a
rich
spiciness
or
a
more
robust
hop
flavor
would
probably
want
to
look
elsewhere
d
a
very
good
winter
warmer
tastes
match
the
season
perfectly
need
to
go
buy
more
of
this
while
it
is
still
available
a
very
good
beer
by
full
sail
d
this
is
a
fine
winter
warmer
it
nailed
the
warmer
element
and
presents
a
well
crafted
balance
between
sweets
and
spices
that
are
reminicent
of
wassail
without
loosing
the
essential
beerness
of
the
brew
overall
a
good
winter
brew
not
my
favorite
this
year
but
not
bad
at
all
cheers
dark
brownishred
with
a
creamy
looking
tan
head
that
is
very
short
but
again
looks
creamy
the
smell
is
very
malty
and
a
slight
whiff
of
raisins
or
prunes
taste
is
the
same
with
an
odd
alcoholic
aftertaste
this
is
actually
my
least
favorite
full
sail
beer
i
wish
they
put
wreck
the
halls
into
sixers
instead
of
this
stuff
i
cant
say
this
isnt
a
good
beer
its
just
one
i
dont
happen
to
care
much
for
poured
from
bottle
into
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
near
black
color
but
when
held
to
the
light
its
dark
ruby
in
appearance
although
when
poured
the
head
was
not
thick
the
retention
was
great
a
thin
layer
sticks
around
throughout
the
beer
tan
head
with
very
a
very
creamy
appearance
to
it
smell
is
unique
i
expected
a
chocolate
and
caramel
smell
to
it
however
hops
are
definitely
present
a
nice
balance
of
both
gives
this
beer
a
terriffic
aroma
hops
hit
my
tounge
up
front
which
leads
to
a
toasted
grain
on
the
backside
a
nice
chocolate
aftertaste
was
a
pleasant
suprise
light
on
the
carbonation
feels
just
right
and
the
creamy
mouthfeel
is
on
par
overall
a
great
beer
imo
best
offering

had
from

average
beer
would
not
be

choice
for

warmer
elegant
frothy

modest
nutty

full
sail
doesnt
go
far
in
being

here
unless
you
consider
daring
to
be
a
lowalcohol
winter
warmer
that
shies
from
the
traditional
panoply
of
tropic
spices
the
brew
is
deep
glowing
red
with
lots
of
polish
deserving
lace
and
ample
body
the
flavor
has

mustiness
with
oldworld
malt
character

are

the
gentle
smoky

hints

good
i
would
go
for


around

a

d

and
only

so
it
seems
to
low
in

taste
for

just
doesnt
do
its
job
d
not
all
that
tasty
to
me
goes
down
ok
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
with
a
few
quirks
to
make
it
different
to
be
honest
its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
of
others
that
i
would
choose
first
even
within
the
style
this
is
one
of
those
ales
that
snuck
up
on
me
i
liked
what
i
tasted
in
the
first
few
ounces
and
i
love
what
im
tasting
in
the
last
few
this
is
yet
another
outstanding
winter
warmer
from
the
pacific
northwest
that
favors
hops
at

as
much
if
not
more
than
it

a
cool
winter
night
or
as
a
nightcap
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
large
thistle
with
a
dark
brown
sugar
color
while
a
decent
lingering
tan
head
settled
on
top
smelled
of
lightly
roasted
malt
as
caramel
and
hops
intertwine
and
trail
off
tastes
have
touches
of
apple
cider
spices
and
subtle
dark
malt
with
a
full
hoppy
finish
medium
mouth
feel
not
a
heavy
beer
but
not
really
a
session
beer
either
paired
great
with
a
lemonsage
roasted
chicken
enjoy
a
translucent
dark
purplish
chocolate
color
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipated
and
left
a
slight
sticky
lace
a
fairly
sweet
piney
aroma
dominates
joining
roasted
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
malty
with
burnt
toast
and
sweet
spruce
finishing
with
a
strong
bitter
taste
and
warmth
of
alcohol
the
body
leans
towards
thin
and
boozy
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
i
found
the
aftertaste
a
bit
too
acrid
to
make
the
wassail
that
drinkable
even
more
so
if
you
serve
it
strait
from
the
fridge
pours
a
clean
clear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
nice
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
mostly
slightly
sweet
malts
some
hops
and
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sligthly
sweetmalty
with
a
very
nice
touch
of
caramel
the
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
medium
body
very
drinkable
a
nice
winter
warmer
d
as
a
standalone
drink
without
food
this
is
a
good
one
thicker
medium
body
a
touch
of
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
with
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
i
am
really
starting
to
warm
up
to
these
winter
warmers
creamy
tan
head
was
small
dissipated
quickly
color
was
a
dark
clear
toasted
burgundy
aroma
was
light
subtly
sweet
carbonation
was
mild
flavor
is
surprisingly
light
malts
are
dry
not
overly
sweet
dry
aftertaste
lingers
warmly
wouldnt
mind
having
another
right
now
very
drinkable
perfect
for
this
winter
season
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
for
sure
one
of
the
best
holiday
seasonals
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
try
and
definitely
one
of
this
breweries
best
offerings
wow
this
is
a
real
treat
it
pours
to
a
thick
bubbly
offwhite
head
with
lacing
deep
brown
color
and
good
clarity
aroma
is
of
fresh
spicy
hops
there
is
also
a
very
rich
maltiness
in
the
aroma
that
smells
delicious
flavor
is
very
big
and
a
pleasure
to
savor
it
starts
with
a
blast
of
slightly
roasty
malt
and
spicy
hops
and
then
the
hops
take
over
the
palate
in
a
very
good
way
the
malt
sweetness
is
perfectly
balanced
by
the
hops
finishes
with
a
spicy
hoppiness
and
a
very
nice
lingering
caramel
and
roast
malt
goodness
a
very
fine
beer
i
wish
was
available
yearround
fullbodied
dark
brown
winter
warmer
in
the
tradition
of
anchor
osa
grainy
and
spicy
with
a
bitter
bite
from
the
hops
and
perhaps
a
bit
from
the
alcohol
its
no
boozy
beast
but
the
alcohol
is
a
notable
flavor
componant
staking
its
claim
as
heavier
than
average
at
6
5
abv
the
malt
body
is
familiar
but
hard
to
describe
except
as
micro
or
homebrewesqe
there
are
faint
and
subtle
christmas
spices
barely
present
like
clove
cinnomon
nutmeg
and
gingerbread
would
pair
well
with
pumpkin
pie
spicy
carbonation
everything
about
it
is
above
average
nice
long
bitter
fallout
cheers
thanks
boolshot
for
the
opportunity
pours
thick
brown
with
a
moderate
amount
of
head
smells
of
a
little
malt
a
lot
of
hops
something
piney
in
there
a
trace
of
spice
maybe
allspice
and
a
dash
of
cinnamon
i
swear
its
almost
as
hoppy
as
an
ipa
the
finish
is
a
little
longer
and
smoother
but
with
some
alcoholic
bite
its
not
bad
to
drink
though
i
think
a
winter
warmer
should
be
maltier
and
not
as
hoppy
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
could
easily
imagine
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
with
a
sixpack
of
this
stuff
very
drinkable
medium
mouthfeelchewy
and
cloying
enjoyable
brewvery
tasty
making
for
a
good
drinkability
complex
aromas
and
taste
a
very
good
winter
beer
poured
a
chesnut
brown
with
a
well
formed
1
12
finger
beige
colored
head
that
left
nice
rings
of
lace
as
it
slowly
big
chocolate
aromas
along
with
some
nice
drying
earthiness
quite
roasted
in
characterquite
dry
i
have
to
say
on
the
palate
wich
in
my
opinion
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
winter
warmer
brews
unsweetened
chocolate
and
earthy
tones
really
show
themselves
on
the
palate
as
well
as
a
roasted
chesnut
flavor
a
bit
of
spiciness
comes
thru
late
giving
it
a
sharper
finishnot
overly
complex
but
quite
flavorful
iam
glad
i
tried
this
it
is
a
solid
no
frill
winter
warmer
quite
dry
and
tasty
this
is
a
nice
winter
brew
from
this
small
brewery
pours
a
deep
mohagany
with
a
two
fingers
of
head
some
hops
and
roasted
coffeechocolate
come
through
on
the
palate
definitely
a
bit
of
alchohol
noticable
on
the
finish
perhaps
a
little
fruit
at
the
end
as
well
a
good
winter
warmer
drinks
okaygood
but
seems
a
bit
hotter
alcoholwise
this
year
what
gives
i
liked
this
better
last
year
but
a
good
winter
warmer
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
but
only
for
one
or
two
at
a
time
the
flavor
is
sharp
and
overpowering
its
like
a
dark
roasted
ipa
wassail
is
a
deep
redbrown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
note
of
nutmeg
malt
dominates
the
taste
with
expected
winter
warmer
spiciness
and
some
hoppiness
toward
the
end
of
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
the
style
not
light
not
as
full
as
a
porter
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
recalls
an
historical
style
try
this
one
this
is
a
tasty
drinkable
session
worthy
winter
beer
but
i
tend
to
like
my
winter
warmers
to
be
a
bit
more
bold
simple
but
good
aroma
patterns
barrage
of
bold
and
daring
flavors
surprisingly
strong
alcohol
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
the
roasted
and
hoppedup
malt
and
alcohol
delivered
in
a
beautiful
thick
bubbly
substance
maltysweet
on
the
front
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
a
great
seasonal
offering
mouth
an
excellent
combination
of
warm
roast
flavors
and
bitter
grapefruit
hops
very
bitter
finish
with
some
burnt
toast
and
coffee
notes
up
front
some
caramel
but
not
sweet
differing
from
the
smell
delicious
very
complex
winter
warmer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
plenty
of
robust
flavors
to
find
in
every
sip
having
gone
recently
to
trying
full
sail
beers
im
impressed
with
much
of
their
lineup
at
least
whats
available
in
mn
solid
beers
of
high
quality
great
flavors
and
good
recipes
well
done
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
fallwinter
beer
with
a
prominent
hop
profile
another
fine
brew
from
the
folks
at
full
sail
overall
a
decent
christmas
beer
its
kind
of
reminiscent
of
the
hibernation
but
not
quite
as
good
d
could
go
for
a
couple
ruby
subtle
fruity
malt
driven
aroma
with
a
touch
of
caramel
pit
fruit
chocolate
and
hop
leafs
in
the
nose
chewy
malt
accented
flavor
notes
of
caramel
pit
fruit
grape
skins
and
chocolate
along
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
an
enjoyable
brew
mouthfeel
is
to
be
as
expected
nice
fullness
not
watery
this
is
a
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
one
to
return
back
to
every
year
pours
out
a
ruby
brown
with
a
thin
frothy
tan
head
that
leaves
quite
quickly
smells
of
chocolate
roasty
earthy
malt
and
resinous
hops
alcohol
is
present
in
the
nose
but
it
has
a
way
of
tying
the
other
smells
together
this
beer
marries
a
sweet
chocolatey
maltiness
with
a
sturdy
hop
kick
i
think
of
this
as
a
beer
thats
somewhere
in
between
a
winter
warmer
and
a
brown
ale
the
big
gripe
here
too
thin
way
too
watery
here
and
the
flavors
drop
out
as
soon
as
you
start
getting
into
them
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
not
at
all
heavy
yeah
this
ones
pretty
drinkable
good
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
calling
this
a
winter
warmer
seems
a
misnomer
tastes
more
like
an
american
strong
ale
though
at
6
5
it
wouldnt
fit
that
category
either
beer
pours
a
mahogeny
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
head
is
sustaining
well
and
leaving
a
decent
lacing
behind
nose
is
malty
and
of
dark
fruits
taste
is
of
a
hint
of
chocolate
malts
dark
fruits
and
is
balanced
nicely
by
a
nice
dry
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
is
creamy
smooth
drinkability
is
good
as
the
abv
is
a
bit
warming
but
not
over
the
top
i
will
seek
this
brew
out
in
future
holiday
seasons
in
my
esteemed
opinion
wassail
is
quite
good
especially
for
a
winter
seasonal
overall
impression
not
bad
much
hoppier
than
i
expected
and
that
cut
down
the
drinkability
for
me
personally
the
tea
flavor
was
a
bit
much
as
well
just
didnt
blow
my
sail
but
you
should
give
it
a
shot
at
least
once
12oz
bottle
of
the
2005
edition
pours
a
pretty
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
halfinch
creamy
tan
head
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
very
heavy
on
the
roasted
malt
with
some
subtle
holiday
spices
in
the
background
nutmeg
clove
and
a
bit
of
mocha
palate
is
again
full
of
roasted
malt
balanced
by
some
slightly
bitter
floral
hops
spiciness
doesnt
really
come
through
although
a
bit
of
smokiness
is
evident
medium
body
is
a
bit
creamy
carrying
the
flavor
well
a
decent
winter
warmer
i
wouldnt
hunt
it
down
to
try
it
again
and
hoping
thou
will
bear
late
2005
on
tap
at
local
restaurant
pours
deep
mahogany
color
with
nice
creamy
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
nice
american
hops
resin
citrus
pine
the
aroma
was
probably
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
the
first
taste
is
all
hops
tasted
as
expected
from
aroma
then
it
turned
sweet
i
was
able
to
taste
the
bready
malt
and
a
slight
chocolate
flavor
which
was
nice
then
the
hops
snap
back
into
action
cleaning
my
mouth
it
has
nice
body
full
but
not
heavy
it
was
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
taste
fine
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
these
guys
notes
not
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
this
brewery
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
cheers
and
thanks
to
pineywoodsrooter
for
this
brew
d
enjoyable
seemed
similar
to
a
hopped
up
youngs
winter
warmer
i
am
going
to
revisit
this
soon
and
see
how
it
changes
nicely
complex
and
well
balanced
an
excellent
winter
warmer
thanks
to
waldowin
for
this
enjoyable
pacnorthwest
winter
gem
this
guy
really
feels
good
in
your
mouth
and
yes
the
alcohol
content
helps
warm
you
a
bit
on
a
wet
and
cold
evening
another
nice
one
from
the
fine
folks
at
full
sail
not
as
good
as
i
recall
it
from
the
past
another
fine
brew
from
full
sail
one
of
the
more
underrated
breweries
in
my
opinion
never
a
big
fan
of
the
special
winter
brews
save
a
few
pours
out
a
nice
rubybrown
decent
head
some
nice
lacing
smells
malty
with
a
very
slight
spice
taste
isnt
bad
infact
its
pretty
good
malty
with
a
good
hop
presence
thats
a
bit
piney
cinnamon
comes
to
mind
as
well
as
other
holiday
flavors
herbal
not
thick
like
some
heavyweight
winter
brews
its
nice
and
medium
bodied
in
the
middle
while
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
can
def
appreciate
it
i
could
see
these
going
down
pretty
easy
if
thats
your
thing
brown
amber
with
almost
no
head
and
little
carbonation
unremarkable
smells
like
rootbeer
tastes
like
bland
rootbeer
and
malt
liquor
ok
not
that
bad
but
the
taste
is
very
flat
with
some
spice
as
an
afterthought
mouthfeel
isnt
offensive
but
you
wouldnt
know
you
had
a
beer
in
your
mouth
maybe
like
cold
watered
down
au
jus
i
did
finish
a
sixpack
but
only
because
thats
all
that
was
left
in
the
fridge
just
wait
til
nex
year
wow
i
would
never
buy
this
one
again
very
very
disappointing
after
interesting
versions
of
this
beer
ive
had
in
years
past
and
after
their
label
describes
it
as
ridiculously
tasty
winter
ale
blah
pours
a
deep
cherry
red
with
brown
highlights
smell
is
a
decent
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
piney
resiny
hops
sweet
caramelly
malts
are
in
the
forefront
flavorwise
turning
into
a
hop
bitterness
that
packs
a
considerable
bite
for
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
for
a
fireside
sipper
on
a
cold
winters
day
deep
dark
red
in
colour
stunning
aromas
of
lemongrass
ginger
and
nutmeg
more
lemongrass
in
the
flavor
along
with
heather
hops
and
some
grainy
malts
i
tend
to
expect
seasonals
like
this
to
be
syrupy
and
thick
but
this
one
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
you
could
actually
drink
a
few
of
these
and
still
be
able
to
stand
up
afterwards
unique
i
enjoyed
this
winter
offering
carbonation
was
perfect
and
with
the
abv
this
one
could
be
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
out
there
imo
a
definite
must
try
if
you
can
find
it
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
superb
overall
its
a
good
beer
good
for
a
cold
winters
night
and
worth
the
purchase
but
there
are
a
few
other
that
i
would
take
if
i
had
the
choice
between
them
and
wassail
well
done
wassails
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
lightbrown
head
of
average
height
the
aroma
is
an
interesting
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
piney
hops
neither
dominates
leaving
an
interesting
inbetween
smell
a
sip
starts
with
rich
sweet
malt
flavor
but
towards
mid
sip
piney
hops
take
over
and
continue
through
an
extended
finish
the
bitterness
level
is
pretty
high
and
the
hops
have
a
pretty
strong
drying
effect
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
too
hoppy
to
be
what
i
want
from
a
winter
warmer
id
choose
an
ipa
a
2xipa
or
a
maltier
winter
warmer
over
full
sails
wassail
that
said
im
sure
there
are
some
hopheads
thatll
love
this
beer
a
solid
winter
warmer
i
enjoyed
it
overall
impression
fairly
one
dimensional
but
a
well
made
beer
bottle
kept
in
my
fridge
nearly
one
year
to
cool
the
alcohol
hot
bottle
says
best
before
022505
but
i
thought
aging
would
do
this
beer
good
pours
a
three
finger
tan
head
over
a
clear
brown
beer
with
redish
character
some
tiny
particulates
suspended
in
the
beer
smells
rough
grassy
coho
thats
deep
oily
and
enticing
an
underlying
malt
sweet
works
with
the
hops
more
chocolate
than
caramel
tastes
orange
oil
hoppy
flavored
with
pine
and
a
rough
grassy
character
a
piercing
bitter
thats
countered
very
well
by
the
thick
sugary
malt
sweet
the
sugar
sweet
has
some
chocolate
character
and
maybe
a
dark
nut
character
hazelnut
the
finish
is
dry
and
im
left
with
the
impression
ive
just
toked
on
a
cigarette
there
is
also
a
sweet
fruity
ester
that
i
just
cant
place
dark
and
deep
ponderous
aftertaste
prune
and
cinamon
md
body
and
mdheavy
carbonation
as
a
hophead
i
like
the
combination
of
hop
flavor
biter
adn
grassy
coho
nice
malty
that
the
hops
ride
the
crest
of
enjoyable
drinkable
drinkability
bottle
has
a
nice
picture
of
a
spruce
tree
in
the
snowy
forest
with
a
single
red
ball
adorning
it
the
beer
poured
a
tan
head
not
really
prominent
dissipated
rapidly
the
color
is
a
deep
brownishred
the
aroma
is
a
touch
malty
a
touch
fruity
with
some
woodish
notes
and
a
slight
higher
alcohol
fruitiness
as
well
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
maybe
one
of
the
best
balanced
brews
ive
had
it
starts
with
a
little
malt
but
complex
with
hints
of
gingerbread
and
caramel
then
gives
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavor
maybe
pinelike
and
some
dried
fruit
flavors
then
you
get
a
nice
dash
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
to
round
it
out
alcohol
content
is
a
little
rough
but
still
good
thanks
to
secret
santa
2004
nvsblman
for
this
one
something
about
the
blend
of
hops
takes
away
from
the
rest
of
it
bitterness
really
takes
over
the
finish
and
leaves
no
trace
of
the
other
good
flavors
still
its
not
a
bad
beer
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
drinkability
tasted
like
more
a
pleasent
wintery
one
finally
an
american
winter
beer
that
is
not
spice
riddled
im
realizing
that
i
like
full
sail
beer
lately
and
this
brew
is
no
exception
dark
copper
body
was
topped
by
a
medium
thick
off
white
head
lacing
was
scattered
but
intricate
aroma
was
of
slightly
toasted
malts
taste
profile
was
a
surprise
as
it
was
very
hoppy
with
citrus
notes
good
drinkable
winter
beer
i
liked
that
it
wasnt
real
heavy
and
spicy
a
hop
accented
winter
beer
and
i
liked
it
dark
brown
in
color
a
deep
but
mostly
clear
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
thin
spotty
tan
head
fruitcake
and
bubblegum
aroma
some
toffee
malt
and
spice
more
bubblegum
in
the
flavor
the
biggest
selling
point
is
a
really
nice
roasty
bitter
flavor
at
the
end
that
lingers
long
into
the
aftertaste
overall
a
very
englishtasting
beer
mediumbodied
and
pretty
easydrinking
not
too
shabby
not
as
warm
as
it
is
hot
winter
warmer
my
butt
just
another
overhopped
interpretation
rich
dark
ruby
with
a
small
offwhite
head
nose
is
made
up
of
grapes
vinous
raisins
tangy
malt
backed
by
evergreen
boughs
and
pine
resin
like
a
christmas
tree
dipped
in
jam
sweetish
vinous
malt
flavors
up
front
hops
come
on
big
and
early
resinous
piney
and
delicious
finish
is
bitter
and
piney
with
sweet
sugar
cookie
notes
yum
mediumbodied
refreshing
yet
warming
enough
for
the
winter
i
could
drink
it
but
it
is
a
bit
hoppy
for
my
tastes
and
seems
more
bitter
than
most
winter
warmers
drinkability
is
ok
for
me
i
really
avoid
winter
brews
however
this
one
is
great
if
i
had
to
drink
one
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
style
full
sail
continues
to
impress
me
with
a
nice
roster
of
ales
overall
i
would
rather
have
a
jubelale
from
deschutes
than
another
wassail
from
full
sail
but
it
is
a
much
better
winter
warmer
than
celebration
ale
which
should
be
renamed
holiday
ipa
as
it
rhymes
and
indicates
what
you
will
taste
better
the
brewers
at
full
sail
should
have
bottle
conditioned
this
one
as
well
so
that
it
can
be
aged
more
than
a
year
and
that
they
could
have
achieved
a
much
higher
carbonation
level
with
less
carbonic
bite
a
great
winter
beer
if
it
is
all
that
is
available
besides
leftover
summerfest
and
the
usual
flagship
brews
a
great
winter
warmer
the
color
was
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
long
time
the
smell
was
slightly
piney
and
very
spicey
and
made
me
want
to
investigate
further
out
of
all
the
winter
beers
ive
had
this
year
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
for
sure
the
flavor
was
ultra
balanced
with
a
great
bitter
hop
rush
in
the
beginning
that
was
matched
quickly
by
a
kick
of
malt
and
spices
and
a
nice
spice
aftertaste
left
me
wanting
more
good
job
other
comments
fullflavored
but
pretty
clean
almost
literally
from
the
slight
soapy
taste
a
good
xmas
brew
though
really
fresh
taste
this
is
a
delightful
drinking
experience
this
beer
offers
all
that
you
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmerrich
complex
flavor
and
smooth
easy
drinkability
a
pleasant
drink
to
have
while
staring
at
the
lights
of
your
chritmas
tree
i
usually
avoid
full
sail
due
in
part
to
their
typically
lackluster
lineup
and
atrocious
graphic
design
that
appears
to
be
intended
for
i
dont
know
yuppies
with
sail
boats
but
this
particular
brew
was
a
welcomed
surprise
nevertheless
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
the
pine
especially
suits
the
time
of
year
well
drinkability
better
as
it
warms
didnt
sense
a
huge
alcohol
presence
which
makes
it
go
down
easily
good
beer
but
not
great
but
definitely
worth
a
try
each
christmas
this
beer
pours
an
amber
brown
with
a
white
cascading
head
the
beer
has
a
nice
hop
aroma
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
aroma
also
smells
estery
but
not
that
pleasant
of
esters
smells
yeasty
but
is
not
bottle
conditioned
and
alcoholic
taste
is
roasted
malts
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
it
is
fairly
well
hopped
so
this
may
skew
my
perception
nice
hoppy
aftertaste
alcohol
taste
is
there
as
well
it
could
be
blended
in
better
perhaps
this
beer
could
have
used
more
aging
probably
couldnt
drink
very
many
of
these
because
of
the
alcohol
content
but
is
a
nice
sipping
brew
a
little
disappointed
here
with
my
first
full
sail
sampling
although
my
expectations
were
high

some

and
a
roasted

it
does
not
seem
to
be

hoppy
but
it
is
older
though
i
do
not
know
how
old
it
also
has
a
slight
pleasant
oxidized

can

2003
edition
a
lovely
dark
reddishbrownish
colour
the
aromas
are
very
sweet
fruity
piney
and
all
over
the
place
kind
of
like
an
osa
with
sugar
added
interesting
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
definate
light
hops
and
malts
in
their
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
but
never
cloying
and
the
drinkability
is
nice
a
good
one
for
the
year
2003
it
had
a
nice
browncopper
color
with
a
small
head
that
did
not
last
too
long
the
lace
was
decent
it
had
a
fragrant
fruity
aroma
with
elements
of
grapefruit
and
berries
the
taste
was
good
citrusy
and
fruity
with
the
presence
of
caramel
a
good
use
of
flavoring
hops
added
much
to
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
bitter
alcoholly
and
a
little
oily
it
culminated
with
a
smooth
dry
sweet
finish
a
pleasant
beer
to
have
around
this
is
a
dark
mahogany
beer
with
a
small
light
tan
thick
head
dishwasherspotty
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
and
floral
a
nice
creaminess
with
underlying
toffee
and
some
grapes
very
hoppy
in
the
front
a
tangy
fruity
full
middle
a
bitter
floral
dark
hoppy
dry
finish
with
some
nice
spiciness
a
little
grainsy
in
the
aftertaste
theres
almost
a
red
wine
thing
going
on
in
the
finish
for
me
the
sweetness
in
the
nose
never
really
developed
but
i
still
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
there
is
something
about
winter
ales
that
allow
a
certain
abandon
to
their
creation
this
version
pours
a
deep
chocolate
with
a
thin
lace
deep
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
aromas
the
smooth
sweet
flavor
hints
at
bittersweet
chocolate
and
sugary
caramel
the
bitterness
is
moderate
with
a
heartwarming
finish
and
an
earthy
spruce
hop
spice
balanced
and
tasty
on
a
stormy
winter
night
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
small
shortlasting
offwhite
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
tastes
of
coffe
and
roasted
flavors
has
other
flavors
that
i
cant
really
place
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
winter
brew
to
say
the
least
there
are
better
examples
out
there
but
this
is
still
worth
trying
im
tasting
a
2002
and
2003
sidebyside
the
aged
2002
is
a
bit
cloudy
both
have
a
small
head
that
sits
for
a
while
both
are
wonderful
examples
of
the
american
christmas
special
maltyhoppy
high
alcohol
and
highly
flavored
old
ale
dopplebock
trippel
porter
variant
that
takes
a
moment
to
warm
in
the
mouth
before
hitting
you
with
a
punch
reminds
me
of
the
anchor
christmas
seasonal
lots
of
reviewers
seem
unimpressed
let
them
drink
pabst
i
think
its
a
wonderful
beer
consider
letting
a
couple
age
a
year
or
two
dont
be
scared
fresh
up
it
has
more
bite
aged
it
has
a
rounded
dessertlike
quality
i
think
its
my
last
2002
so
ill
put
a
few
2003s
aside
and
write
again
in
a
few
years
merry
christmas
not
a
huge
complex
or
unusually
spiced
beer
but
a
very
drinkable
greattasting
brew
ill
be
back
for
more
didnt
really
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
the
aroma
was
somewhat
like
that
of
the
02
anchor
xmas
ale
but
the
flavor
wasnt
as
appealing
still
an
interesting
brew
recommended
well
it
has
been
2
years
since
i
sampled
this
beer
so
let
us
see
if
it
has
improved
any
in
that
time
the
pour
is
an
unblurred
sanguineous
color
the
head
exorbitant
in
size
and
frothy
in
texture
as
it
degenerates
it
leaves
glutinous
sheets
of
lace
to
smother
the
glass
nose
is
spicy
with
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
coriander
and
malt
lightly
sweet
and
a
real
sniffer
for
the
old
schnozzle
start
is
all
malt
the
top
skimpy
in
mouth
feel
just
not
all
there
the
finish
is
mildly
carbonated
sparsely
hopped
the
aftertaste
dry
and
lightly
bitter
cannot
really
say
this
beer
does
much
for
me
waterish
and
just
lacking
in
my
humble
opinion
sampled
111903
aromas
of
malt
fruit
perhaps
some
cherry
notes
and
a
subdued
spice
character
as
well
a
brown
ale
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
shows
deep
clear
amber
hues
when
held
up
to
the
light
nice
pretty
well
balanced
though
perhaps
a
tad
thin
lightly
sweet
in
the
front
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
spiciness
in
the
finish
it
is
like
a
little
brother
to
deschutes
jubelale
some
definite
cherry
notes
here
really
does
remind
me
of
a
weaker
version
of
the
jubelale
if
i
had
not
had
that
i
would
think
a
bit
more
highly
of
this
still
this
is
pretty
good
drinkability

a
nice
example
of
the
style
especially
at
a
little
over
a
dollar
a
bottle
what
a
great
beer
to
have
with
game
and
root
veggies
might
even
be
nice
to
go
with
a
spicy
homemade
pumpkin
pie
bonus
i
dont
know
if
they
change
the
recipe
yearly
but
this
was
enjoyed
more
than
in
past
years
notes
wow
pretty
interesting
stuff
will
definitely
seek
this
out
in
the
future
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
it
is
very
present
it
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
and
some
slickness
the
drinkability
falls
in
the
sipping
category
for
me
personally
it
goes
down
very
easily
but
i
will
still
sip
all
i
need
now
is
for
it
to
snow
in
so
cal
and
a
fire
place
love
the
name
wassail
dark
mahogany
with
a
very
sturdy
beige
head
and
loads
of
sticky
lace
a
nice
fruity
aroma
mixes
well
with
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
the
sweet
and
smoky
heavy
malt
blends
nicely
with
the
complex
berries
citrus
and
lightly
metallic
hop
bite
this
is
a
strong
and
hearty
winter
offering
i
hope
to
find
some
more
this
coming
winter
thanks

the

of
the

i
was
expecting
a
strong
hoppy
beer
somewhat
similar
to
the
sierra

celebration
ale
but
this
beer
was
surprisingly
subtle
it
is
hoppy
without
being
overwhelming
i
was
expecting
more
malt
flavors
but
they
werent
missed
once
the
beer
warms
some
a
slight
cranberry
flavor
arises
and
the
hops
become
more
present
this
gives
the
beer
a
very
nice
character
overall
this
is
a
very
good
winter
brew
very
drinkable
with
decent

definately
something
i
could

almost

it

a
seasonal

i
would
enjoy
this

with
hard
to
find
orange

ruby
highlights
a
short
and
very
creamy
light
tan
head
comes
up
during
the
pour
but
it
drops
off
almost
as
quickly
it
does
however
maintain
a
nice
creamy
collar
and
leaves
some
spotty
lace
the
nose
is
subtle
but
enticing
it
offers
some
lighttoffeeish
maltiness
some
gentle
fruitiness
a
touch
of
almost
indistinguishable
spice
nutmeg
allspice
light
cinnamon
coriander
and
some
mild
floral
hops
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
an
exceptionally
finebubbled
mild
carbonation
thats
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
starts
with
some
soft
berrylike
fruitiness
that
develops
into
a
light
candyish
note
before
revealing
its
caramelish
malt
character
as
it
crosses
the
palate
it
finishes
with
a
flair
of
spice
that
dries
more
than
the
underlying
bitterness
generic
spice
and
candyish
sweetness
linger
in
the
mouth
and
throat
along
with
some
piney
hop
character
definitely
and
interesting
brew
if
given
the
chance
worth
trying
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
winter
sipping
brew
to
be
drank
on
cold
nights
next
to
warm
fires
i
recommend
it
fine
sturdy
offwhite
head
dark
brown
color
sweet
aroma
but
nothing
too
distinctive
coming
through
faint
hints
of
toffee
nuts
spices
mild
hoppiness
medium
carbonation
sweet
maltiness
very
mild
very
mellow
but
to
a
fault
i
like
my
winter
ales
with
more
of
a
kick
and
this
slides
down
too
smooth
for
my
tastes
feels
as
if
they
were
shooting
for
something
like
anchors
our
special
ale
but
something
held
them
back
nice
color
deep
deep
redbrown
the
head
is
average
size
and
dry
and
sandy
looking
the
aroma
is
warm
malt
and
is
a
bit
spicy
the
flavor
is
less
malty
than
i
would
have
thought
with
the
appearance
a
bit
sour
in
the
finish
coriander
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fuzzy
my
first
full
sail
beer
and
if
i
can
help
it
it
wont
be
my
last
thanks
to
txhops
for
the
brew
i
will
investigate
other
full

beers

release
very
nice
looking
brew
a
dark
dark
red
body
almost
brown
very
much
like
the
color
of
a
barleywine
the
head
is
light
tan
also
like
barleywine
and
retains
exceptionally
aroma
is
that
of
pine
and
christmas
treelike
hops
very
nice
touch
i
was
waiting
for
a
christmas
beer
that
was
hopped
like
this
combined
with
that
is
a
toasted
malt
making
a
very
unique
aroma
just
a
touch
of
fruitiness
is
in
there
as
well
as
for
the
flavors
wow
this
is
very
unique
as
well
the
hops
are
definitely
americanstyle
while
the
malt
is
very
english
hops
are
more
spicy
here
with
the
christmas
treepine
character
being
more
of
an
undertone
a
bit
of
citrus
is
noticeable
as
well
the
malt
is
toasted
sweet
and
breadlike
in
addition
to
all
of
that
im
getting
some
dried
fig
excellent
beer
very
drinkable
definitely
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
from
it
ill
definitely
have
this
again
and
again
and
again
first
thanks
to
bighuge
for
enabling
me
to
sample
this
beer
it
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
roasted
malt
is
what
i
mostly
detect
in
the
aroma
roasted
malt
and
spices
dominate
the
flavor
up
front
the
beer
is
well
balanced
with
hops
and
finishes
neutral
to
slightly
bitter
very
drinkable
with
a
very
good
flavor
although
i
might
prefer
it
to
be
just
a
bit
bolder
great
winter
ale
i
must
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
seasonals
ive
tried
thus
far
this
beer
pours
out
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
it
has
a
decent
off
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
the
balance
can
be
detected
right
off
the
bat
on
the
nose
with
both
malt
and
hops
competing
for
attention
malt
speaks
up
first
on
the
tongue
while
the
hops
get
in
the
last
word
and
speak
bitterly
into
the
long
finish
a
good
balance
of
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
molassas
and
hops
with
a
piney
earthiness
make
this
beer
a
delight
to
drink
throw
in
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
and
you
have
yourself
a
hearty
brew
that
chases
away
the
winter
blues
thanks
to

enjoy
this

not
as
syrupy
sweet
or
hyperspiced
as
most
winter
warmers
the
malty
carmel
taste
is
refreshing
at
first
with
a
slightly
bitter
hoppy
finish
this
one
has
a
mild
skunk
at
the
end
probably
because
it
almost
easter
and
a
bit
late
for
a
winter
warmer
of
course
the
high
today
was
in
the
mid
20s
and
this
is
warming
me
up
nicely
very
well
balanced
normally
i
like
my
winter
warmers
to
be
a
little
sweeter
but
with
this
one
i
dont
mind
just
the
right
mix
of
flavors
if
it
was
sweeter
it
might
ruin
that
mix
perfect
for
the
thanksgiving
meal
every
year
pours
a
two
finger
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
spots
of
sticky
lacing
mahogany
and
slightly
cloudy
smells
like
candied
dates
and
raisins
taste
is
what
i
expect
from
the
aroma
with
a
bittering
finish
lingering
sensation
of
dark
dried
fruits
as
well
as
some
plum
feel
is
on
thicker
side
and
low
carbonation
light
chewiness
and
somewhat
viscous
a
fun
winter
style
beer
and
a
good
buy
for
the
price
taste
is
molasses
caramelly
dark
and
sweet
chocolate
with
slight
barky
hops
this
makes
for
a
nice
bock
like
beer
a
good
winter
warmer
although
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
prefer
ruby
red
in
the
light
thin
lacing
of
head
great
color
hint
of
tobacco
light
nose
overall
backbone
of
solid
malts
warm
spicy
and
nicely
blended
a
bit
of
bright
hop
bitterness
on
the
end
some
alcohol
some
murk
in
essence
overall
but
good
residual
carryover
of
spice
and
hint
of
yeast
overall
nice
love
some
deschutes
maybe
earlier
in
the
season
next
time
228
bottle
nice
reddish
brown
pour
with
good
body
not
a
strong
smell
but
malt
and
spices
were
noticeable
nice
pour
and
a
very
good
taste
of
herbs
and
orange
felt
good
going
down
and
had
a
decent
kick
overall
very
good
beer
and
ill
be
seeking
this
out
down
the
road
finally
i
feel
like
i
can
really
call
myself
a
beer
lover
now
ive
tried
one
of
deschutes
original
beers
2014
was
silky
smooth
hints
of
chicory
and
cherry
rounded
by
a
huge
malt
finish
a
hint
of
citrus
zest
but
all
together
a
great
winter
warmer
warmed
me
right
up
do
you
expect
anything
less
from
deshutes
though
theyre
the
best
a
very
good
beer
overall
all
the
parts
fit
together
well
full
of
flavor
not
just
spices
i
wouldnt
limit
it
to
just
winter
malt
a
little
caramel
no
hops
bitterness
moderate
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
it
all
blends
together
well
though
good
winter
beer
this
is
a
quality
holiday
beer
never
too
sweet
but
still
complex
in
terms
of
spice
flavor
o
very
interesting
comparable
to
belgian
quad
in
aroma
and
flavor
but
with
lower
alcohol
and
a
more
dry
carbonic
bite
a
lot
to
like
here
overall
this
is
a
light
flavorful
brew
that
would
be
perfect
for
fall
sessioninga
pleasant
surprise
had
this
beer
from
a
nitro
tap
i
havent
had
that
many
nitro
beers
before
but
this
one
was
surprisingly
very
good
it
is
worth
a
shot
nice
hoppy
winter
warmer
not
really
my
style
but
a
fine
example
of
this
variety
a
little
bit
too
toastysmokey
for
my
taste
probably
a
great
beer
for
someone
else
but
not
my
style
good
winter
offering
but
there
are
a
lot
of
good
ones
out
there
pours
a
clear
garnet
amber
with
large
offwhite
head
good
carbonation
initial
nose
has
some
gentle
spices
clove
pepper
brown
sugar
underlying
malt
smells
of
some
light
chocolate
as
it
warms
the
chocolate
caramel
aromas
really
shine
through
and
come
to
he
forefront
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
some
chocolate
cocoa
upfront
spiciness
not
sure
from
hops
or
actual
spices
medium
high
bitterness
feels
medium
full
to
full
with
no
hot
alcohols
overall
a
nice
malty
beer
for
the
cold
winter
nights
subtle
spiciness
lends
some
complexity
but
doesnt
distract
very
solid
winter
ale
overall
great
to
pair
with
dark
chocolates
poured
from
a
bottle
into
pint
glass
nice
color
and
healthy
head
malts
on
the
nose
with
a
light
but
crisp
hop
finish
the
flavors
hang
out
on
your
tongue
for
a
bit
after
too
very
nicely
done
beautiful
mahogany
color
thick
light
tan
head
brilliant
appearance
the
smell
is
of
malt
with
a
little
spice
bitter
taste
with
some
warmth
lots
of
dark
malt
flavors
warming
full
in
body
great
winter
beer
pours
a
dark
red
almost
to
brown
color
thin
off
white
head
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
english
toffee
and
light
clove
the
spices
here
complement
rather
than
overwhelm
the
palate
definitely
a
complex
winter
seasonal
enough
boozy
heat
and
spice
to
make
this
a
winter
warmer
but
with
plenty
of
other
layers
that
allow
for
more
balance
and
other
pieces
to
fall
into
place
the
toffee
notes
add
a
sweetness
and
brevity
across
the
dark
maltiness
one
of
many
just
ok
winter
ales
a
little
more
hop
than
others
light
spice
some
molasses
kinda
plain
wanted
some
more
flavor
but
ok
overall
slight
molasses
aftertaste
otherwise
pleasant
winter
brew
wow
this
is
good
ive
had
this
in
bottles
and
on
nitrotap
really
tasty
either
way
malty
with
enough
hop
presence
to
add
some
complexity
terrific
winter
brew
not
very
impressed
as
a
winter
warmer
not
very
warming
at
5
was
served
on
nitro
which
aided
mouthfeel
but
not
anything
special
o
a
great
christmas
time
beer
pleasantly
warming
without
cloying
spices
or
flavors
would
go
great
with
christmas
ham
overall
a
nice
holiday
brew
that
warms
on
a
cold
night
and
at
a
great
price
o
very
wintry
and
robust
one
and
done
but
very
flavorful
for
the
holidays
drank
on
its
own
but
i
could
see
it
as
a
great
food
pairing
for
a
rich
christmas
dinner
descent
flavor
but
a
little
over
hopped
and
over
spiced
an
interesting
winter
hoppy
ale
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
a
lot
closer
to
a
regular
ipa
than
to
a
winter
seasonal
the
60
ibus
make
it
hoppier
than
most
christmas
beers
and
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
the
traditional
mix
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
etc
that
most
others
in
the
style
have
so
yeah
its
ok
but
not
really
a
great
example
of
a
holiday
beer
i
prefer
other
deschutes
beers
to
this
one
o
an
above
average
holiday
beer
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
nice
to
have
to
sit
around
by
the
fire
and
chat
with
the
family
excellent
holiday
ale
not
too
much
of
the
usual
nutmeg
etc
a
pretty
unique
holiday
ale
that
tastes
very
good
o
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
great
taste
of
all
mentioned
but
nothing
dominent
at
6
7
not
quite
sessionable
but
would
really
enjoy
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
bring
em
on
overall
i
say
this
was
a
good
winter
warmer
id
come
back
to
tried
it
on
a
cold
boring
night
when
i
was
itching
for
a
winter
ale
half
of
it
still
went
down
the
drain
pours
a
very
deep
reddishbrown
in
color
with
almost
a
1finger
beige
creamy
head
that
settles
back
down
after
a
while
a
decent
amount
of
sticking
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
some
dark
fruit
and
spices
for
the
most
part
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
there
is
some
semisweet
chocolate
and
pine
in
the
mix
as
well
does
have
a
bitter
finish
that
lasted
a
little
to
long
for
my
liking
though
other
than
that
the
taste
was
decent
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
o
i
use
the
word
balanced
a
lot
in
this
review
but
dont
take
this
as
meaning
bland
there
are
bold
but
balanced
flavors
basically
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
like
stones
oaked
arrogant
bastard
but
favor
a
bit
of
holiday
cheer
stirred
in
this
is
the
beer
for
you
ill
have
this
again
and
it
doesnt
have
to
be
just
at
the
winter
holidays
good
winterholiday
beer
that
doesnt
teeter
to
the
bad
or
the
great
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
nice
thick
cap
with
lacing
on
the
glass
flavor
is
more
bitter
than
i
like
for
winterchristmas
ales
im
typically
a
big
fan
of
deschutes
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
a
solid
effort
with
lots
of
different
aromas
and
flavors
blending
well
together
malty
ale
with
a
full
pallate
of
flavors
cinnamon
netnug
licorice
candy
with
a
hoppy
backbone
nice
brown
amber
color
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
nice
aromas
of
malt
orange
little
berries
cinnamon
and
nuts
taste
has
nice
blend
of
malt
toffee
orange
lemon
nuts
spices
and
hint
of
chocolate
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
this
was
an
enjoyable
one
o
this
is
a
true
winter
warmer
with
some
west
coast
flair
of
course
one
of
the
few
us
takes
on
the
style
that
manages
to
have
bold
elements
of
both
the
malts
of
an
english
ww
and
the
hops
of
an
american
pale
ale
not
sure
i
would
dive
into
another
bottle
of
this
though
maybe
if
they
eased
back
a
touch
on
the
hop
charge
too
much
static
this
beer
is
great
im
glad
i
took
notes
and
really
soaked
this
beer
in
its
an
easytofind
winter
pleaser
that
along
with
celebration
belongs
in
my
fridge
for
a
solid
three
months
i
should
have
tried
a
sixer
before
barrelingup
pleased
with
the
deep
opaque
poor
and
two
fingers
of
tight
pleated
khakis
at
the
helm
malty
richness
with
a
bit
of
toastiness
but
finishes
a
bit
bitter
for
my
taste
worse
yet
and
maybe
im
alone
but
this
one
is
a
headthrobber
about
thirty
minutes
after
seeing
the
bottom
of
my
glass
i
am
met
with
a
dull
headache
deschutes
has
been
new
to
our
market
this
year
and
ive
been
quite
pleased
with
all
of
their
offering
so
im
eager
to
try
this
holiday
offering
less
than
a
fingers
worth
of
rich
fluffy
densely
packed
froth
that
is
khaki
in
color
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
decent
retention
gives
way
to
a
full
film
of
lacing
of
much
the
same
the
color
is
a
slightly
murky
light
to
medium
brown
a
slight
bit
of
moderate
paced
carbonation
throughout
the
nose
is
comprised
of
light
maraschino
cherries
light
caramel
cinnamon
and
a
light
woody
character
its
a
unique
but
pleasing
combination
starts
mellow
and
slightly
sweet
as
the
nose
alluded
to
next
comes
a
prominent
earthy
character
finally
there
is
a
light
charred
character
that
rises
on
the
finish
medium
bodied
crisp
some
sharp
carbonation
finishes
a
touch
dry
with
a
bit
of
chalkiness
a
decent
winter
warmer
all
the
way
around
not
my
favorite
deschutes
offering
it
may
take
a
few
more
to
truly
experience
this
one
as
intended
but
im
confident
ill
get
there
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
winter
warmer
and
one
definitely
worth
trying
o
this
is
a
perfectly
balance
winter
warmer
the
flavors
blend
together
seemlessly
very
nice
o
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
its
warming
sweet
with
just
a
right
amount
of
spice
to
harmonize
it
perfectly
very
very
enjoyable
and
i
highly
recommend
it
final
score
3
94
smooth
bitterness
taste
is
full
but
not
heavy
it
would
go
well
with
a
fire
on
a
snowy
evening
has
a
great
aroma
a
lot
of
character

overall
a

not

would
like

less

overall
a
great

with
a

of
complexity
and
style
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
really
even
better
on
nitro
if
you
can
find
it
like
all
deschutes
offerings
jubelale
is
a
more
mainstreamminded
one
that
still
has
more
than
what
it
takes
to
stand
up
on
its
own
provenance
may
ensure
this
brewerys
commonplace
and
massproduced
brands
are
still
revered
but
truth
be
told
they
havent
compromised
an
ounce
and
are
as
deserving
of
love
now
as
ever
before
jubelale
is
a
great
holiday
tipple
deschutes
nailed
this
one
overall
ive
been
impressed
by
every
deschutes
product
ive
ever
tried
and
what
an
impressive
winter
warmer
theyve
brewed
so
many
nice
flavors
here
and
they
are
all
complimentary
forming
the
perfect
holiday
brew
flavors
and
sweetness
are
perfect
and
at

you
may
be
able
to
enjoy
a
few
without
being
the
guy
wearing
the
lamp
shade
in
the
corner
highly
recommend
i
dont
see
the
fuss
about
this
winter
warmer
its
a
mash
of
leather
bitter
roots
and
mild
oaky
twang
defiantly
not
good
in
my
opinion
note
wife
hates
it
im
just
not
real
sold
on
this
offering
from
deschutes
i
feel
its
somewhat
lacking
the
characteristics
that
make
a
good
holiday
alewinter
warmer
as
an
avid
ipa
fan
i
do
enjoy
the
bitterness
overall
id
have
it
again
not
what
i
was
looking
for
tonight
but
itll
suffice
decent
beer

o
an
impressively
nuanced
and
delicious
warmer
that
i
would
happily
buy
again
many
of
my
favourite
brews
are
released
in
the
fallwinter
you
can
bet
jubelale
is
one
of
them
between
the
warm
full
flavour
and
the
festive
artwork
on
the
label
it
is
the
perfect
ale
to
welcome
in
the
cold
weather

balanced

4

for
jubelale
deschutes
brewery
this
is
a
delicious
choice
and
i
advise
you
to
give
it
a
go
deep
brown
to
amber
in
color
with
an
inch
thick
of
khaki
colored
head
brussels
lacing
i
smell
caramel
malt
and
not
much
else
the
flavor
is
plenty
of
caramel
malt
with
a
spicy
nutty
taste
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
a
solid
winter
brew
the
craftsmanship
is
what
sells
this
beer
for
me
the
mouthfeel
alone
makes
me
want
to
drink
this
all
day
its
along
the
lines
of
a
bold
brown
ale
a
good
mouthful
bitter
and
strong
tasting
its
damn
near
perfect
looks
great
and
smells
delicious
this
is
the
definitive
winter
warmer
strong
and
tasty
a
little
dark
and
spicy
but
not
overwhelming
under
7
so
its
not
a
1bottle
ko
but
not
sessionable
either
this
is
the
right
beer
for
the
dark
cold
season
i
think
deschutes
is
my
favorite
brewery
everything
they
make
is
good
to
great
support
our
troops
overall
this
beer
just
feels
like
the
holidays
like
liquid
fruitcake
spiked
with
a
nice
blast
of
hops
its
hard
to
get
more
festive
than
that
i
have
a
feeling
it
would
even
be
pretty
nice
56
months
from
now
as
the
hops
fade
a
touch
my
bottle
was
super
fresh
letting
the
complex
malts
shine
even
more
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
brews
o
a
solid
winter
warmer
of
the
brown
ale
variety
id
personally
have
preferred
something
with
more
spice
emphasis
and
less
floralpine
influence
though
i
am
an
admitted
malthead
the
body
seemed
a
touch
on
the
light
side
for
a
winter
beer
and
id
also
have
liked
the
malt
to
be
less
toasted
bitter
to
allow
more
sweetness
in
still
not
a
bad
beer
this
isnt
anything
all
that
special
but
it
is
a
well
made
brew
and
worth
drinking
dont
refuse
one
if
it
is
offered
but
find
something
better
for
your
guests
ginger
and
toasted
nutty
caramelly
malt
dominate
the
aroma
floral
hops
add
a
more
beerlike
quality
flavor
reveals
deeply
toasted
caramel
malt
at
the
base
toasted
enough
to
lend
bitterness
along
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
specialty
malt
fruitiness
bittering
hops
round
out
the
flavor
profile
more
bitter
than
most
winter
warmers
the
spices
are
fairly
subtle
with
just
a
hint
of
ginger
surfacing
a
welcome
change
of
pace
though
i
wish
it
were
a
tad
less
bitter
theres
a
metallic
character
that
surfaces
overall
a
nice
little
warmer
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
foamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
spice
the
flavor
is
very
bold
with
malts
and
spice
flavor
fairly
decent
for
the
style
of
beer
it
does
leave
a
bit
of
a
chalky
after
taste
bitter
light
grapefruit
nice
beer
have
had
better
spiced

though
generally
better

of

im

try

somehow
not

still
not

of

still
good
another
fantastic
offering
from
deschutes
easy
to
drink
and
loaded
with
character
definitely
worth
picking
up
very
impressive
thanks
to
beer
revolution
in
cowtown
for
bringing
in
some
nifty
deschutes
brews
of
late
the
holiday
seasonal
from
this
brewery
or
maybe
its
just
a
winter
seasonal
is
a
dark

with
a
decent
amount
of

a
pleasant
surprise
lemonlime

first
of
all
things
followed
by
a

the

time
tastes
of
treacle
toffee
chocolate
syrup
brown

crust
green

citrus
rind
bubblegum
stone
fruit
red
berries
a
barrage
of
dark
malt
and
sweet
fruity
flavors
that
coexist
in
a
tasty
congress
of
the
unexpected
booze
is
detectable
and
becomes
more
so
as
one
proceeds
through
a
pint
lightbodied
and
very
smooth
with
middling
carbonation
featuring
a
long
roasted
finish
accented
by
medicinal
hops
and
gooseberry
notes
really
quite
unique
how
can
toffee
also
taste
zesty
and
refreshing
you
can
read
in
several
reputable
sources
that
dark
malts
and
assertive
hops
typically
mesh
about
as
well
as
the
greeks
and
the
turks
on
cyprus
but
in
all
honesty
i
think
this
is
a
myth
done
right
one
gets
some
tasty
results
i
like
this
brew
as
a
winter
seasonal
session
ale
loads
to
give
as
far
as
taste
and
above
all
others
this
one
sessions
well
for
the
style
carbonation
is
too
high
o
this
beer
is
just
one
of
many
examples
of
why
deschutes
is
one
of
the
best
pacific
coast
breweries
its
exactly
what
i
want
out
of
a
standard
festive
winter
ale
perhaps
better
than
this
is
jubel
which
i
have
yet
to
try
waiting
on
the
abyss
for
a
vertical
dark
raisin
brown
with
a
copper
orange
hue
and
a
light
haze
started
with
a
lush
beige
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass

sugary
caramel
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
freshly
milled
grains
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
full
bodied
with
rich
gentle
carbonation
rich
sweet
caramel
malt
flavors
up
front
with
slowly
emerging
earthy
hop
bitterness
through
the
middle
hop
flavors
transition
to
light
coffee
flavors
as
the
bitterness
fades
to
chocolate
notes
at
the
end
finishes
with
a
light
earthy
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
sweet
and
malty
that
is
tempered
nicely
with
lazy
hop
flavors
through
the
middle
o
awesome
beer
and
still
not
disappointed
by
anything
that
deschutes
has
made

not

not
over
barring
like
some
spiced

lovely
christmas
beer
very
glad
that
i
sprung
the
45
on
this
case
d
highly
sessionable
especially
for
style
not
overly
aggressive
on
the
spice
which
serves
this
one
well
mouth
heavy
bodied
and
very
present
when
upon
the
first
drink
medium
to
light
carbonation
that
fits
the
style
well
this
beer
is
aimed
at
easy
drinking
for
its
size
and
is
just
that
i
like
it
o
the
definition
of
winter
warmer
in
my
books
httpyoutu
betjowachg1no
tis
reminds
me
of
a
nut
brown
ale
wi
winter
spices
great
combo
mingling
of
the
character
in
this
beer
o
a
very
solid
winter
warmer
with
so
few
blemishes
nothing
really
unique
about
it
that
will
leave
me
with
much
of
an
impression
but
still
very
well
done
overall
impression
my
goto
winter
warmer
since
i
was
a
baby
beer
geek
so
i
might
be
biased
but
i
find
this
to
consistently
be
one
of
the
best
winter
craft
beers
ive
ever
had
the
only
flaw
i
detect
this
year
is
a
hint
of
diacetyl
in
the
aroma
not
in
the
flavor
though
an
excellent
brew
this
is
an
excellent
very
flavorful
ale

bottle
if
you
can
cheers
and
thanks
bill
for
the
chance
to
try
this
fine
beer
o
good
beer
from
deschutes
not
too
heavy
but
delivers
some
good
malt
and
hop
flavors
infused
quite
nicely
try
it
if
you
can
sign
me
up
for
more
of
this
next
year
add
this
to
my
cases
of
celebration
and
winter
just
got
even
better
a
nice
unspiced
take
on
the
style
this
turned
out
to
be
a
wonderful
treat
to
say
the
least
i
poured
this
into
a
stout
glass
the
head
isnt
super
thick
and
just
barely
hangs
around
enough
for
you
to
finish
the
brew
but
the
lacing
isnt
bad
considering
a
real
lack
of
head
the
color
might
remind
some
of
iced
tea
but
i
think
its
kind
of
nice
considering
the
time
of
year
its
consumed
some
might
say
it
appears
like
iced
tea
others
along
the
lines
of
a
single
malt
scotch
either
way
i
like
it
the
scent
is
really
nice
you
get
a
layer
of
malt
caramel
spices
and
hops
but
no
one
thing
is
overpowering
now
the
mouth
feel
is
just
perfect
kind
of
creamy
but
all
very
very
pleasant
and
it
all
adds
to
incredible
drinkability
the
taste
is
full
of
flavor
and
it
all
seems
to
work
in
waves
first
thing
you
get
is
some
malt
followed
by
some
great
floral
spices
maybe
cinnamon
i
even
got
very
very
very
subtle
notes
of
chocolate
in
the
end
you
get
a
little
baby
punch
of
hops
which
was
kind
of
a
pleasant
surprise
guys
this
is
not
a
hoppy
beer
but
they
come
out
in
the
end
all
very
very
smooth
and
extremely
pleasant
anyone
can
enjoy
this
as
its
subtle
enough
for
a
newbie
but
complex
enough
for
the
beer
snob
deschutes
hit
this
one
out
of
the
park
i
would
never
have
guessed
the
ibus
were
60
great
beer
decent
appearance
aroma
and
mouthfeel
where
this
beer
rocked
it
was
in
the
taste
i
wasnt
looking
to
pair
it
with
anything
specific
for
my
lunch
but
ate
it
with
a
roast
beef
hot
dip
sandwich
served
with
guinness
au
jus
dang
the
beer
went
well
and
i
went
through
2
pints
with
or
without
a
sandwich
like
this
i
recommend
it
on
tap
for
some
reason
i
didnt
like
the
2012
jubilale
that
much
but
this
year
it
is
superb
again
poured
a
deep
brown
with
one
finger
tan
head
it
was
very
dark
and
very
appealing
quite
nice
to
the
eye
scents
of
fruity
esters
spiciness
citrus
pith
some
pine
slight
funk
overripe
fruit
and
some
apricot
sweetness
a
good
aroma
quite
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
bit
of
a
citrus
hop
aroma
flavor
is
citrus
pith
and
pine
resin
bitterness
balanced
by
banana
tropical
fruit
a
caramel
malt
backbone
and
fruity
and
overripe
fruit
flavors
its
quite
sweet
and
fruity
but
with
enough
west
coast
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
quite
nice
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
its
got
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
fruit
and
bitter
hops
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
like
many
winter
warmer
and
it
has
enough
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
o
overall
this
isnt
bad
its
wonderful
looking
and
has
a
good
taste
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
just
a
little
more
than
i
like
i
get
this
every
year
always
a
solid
offering
pours
a
reddish
brown
clarified
ale
with
an
ecru
head
smells
very
malty
jammy
and
of
dark
candied
fruit
kind
of
like
fruitcake
now
that
i
think
about
it
flavor
brings
a
bit
more
chocomocha
to
it
along
with
dark
fruit
and
a
little
winelike
strawberry
element
mouthfeel
is
pretty
solid
somewhere
between
medium
and
heavy
bodied
but
this
isnt
a
huge
beer
abv
comes
in
a
bit
below
a
7
and
for
the
style
i
think
it
should
achieve
at
least
a
7
but
im
not
making
the
rules
here
overall
very
good
winter
warmer
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
good
offering
from
deschutes
its
got
great
aroma
and
a
wonderful
flavor
ill
hold
off
on
the
others
until
it
a
leasts
gets
cold
o
one
of
the
staples
of
the
winter
seasonals
its
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
im
not
terribly
impressed
but
its
still
a
very
good
beer
o
a
rich
flavoursome
malty
winter
ale
very
moreish
one
of
my
goto
favourite
autumnwinter
beers
overall
an
excellent
beer
especially
on
tap
it
is
early
for
winter
ales
but
i
enjoyed
it
just
as
well
doesnt
beat
sn
celebration
as
my
go
to
winter
warmer
brew
but
but
definitely
a
good
one
when
mixing
it
up
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
that
i
enjoyed
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
grab
this
one
while
you
can
smooth
easy
drinking
winter
warmer
think
chocolate
cinnamon
brown
ale
a
choice
dark
ale
for
the
winter
months
this
was
the
first
ale
i
have
ever
tried
jubelale
was
easy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
and
i
even
felt
a
little
buzzed
from
my
first
beer
hops
can
be
an
overwhelming
taste
for
me
personally
and
this
was
not
overpowering
at
all
i
would
drink
jubelale
again
and
would
say
this
is
a
fitting
beer
for
learning
palate
o
i
am
very
impressed
with
the
quality
of
beer
here
delicious
get
some
pours
a
nice
deep
red
with
a
thin
coffee
head
smells
of
wood
and
smoke
with
a
little
hop
to
it
tastes
alright
much
more
of
a
smoke
flavor
than
i
would
like
to
see
from
what
appears
to
be
a
red
ale
wheres
the
hops
kinda
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
hops
in
this
one
needs
more
coffee
or
caramel
to
balance
with
that
intense
smokey
flavor
i
do
like
the
mouthfeel
nice
bubbly
and
light
the
finish
again
lacks
with
a
fairly
watery
smoke
flavor
overall
probably
my
least
favorite
deschutes
beer
that
ive
had
shame
really
now
i
guess
ill
just
have
to
drink
powder
hound
or
sleigher
all
winter
overall
great
beer
for
this
style
something
i
wouldnt
turn
down
deschutes
does
it
again
overall
deschutes
has
kinda
been
a
disappointment
for
me
so
far
however
this
beer
was
very
good
i
really
dont
know
how
many
beers
i
will
continue
to
try
from
them
because
it
seems
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
is
worth
checking
out
overall
a
very
drinkable
but
full
flavored
fallwinter
beer
i
would
choose
this
over
many
of
the
fallwinter
seasonals
or
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
so
far
and
is
relatively
cheap
at
8
per
6pack
the
taste
starts
with
dark
dried
cherry
with
a
slight
woody
spice
which
is
cinnamonlike
with
some
woody
hops
blending
in
the
taste
and
complimenting
the
mild
caramel
foundation
with
a
light
warmth
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
pretty
great
balance
of
flavors
malt
hops
with
a
spice
presence
i
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
better
winter
ales
i
have
tried
this
year
overall
a
very
unique
and
offthebeatenpath
winter
warmer
by
deschutes
almost
shares
similarities
with
a
redamber
ale
a
nice
way
to
celebrate
a
25th
anniversary
i
found
this
to
be
a
delicious
beer
even
on
an
april
evening
almost
has
a
stouty
initial
hit
with
some
espresso
and
a
bit
of
tartness
poured
with
a
creamy
brown
half
inch
head
into
a
big
pinot
glass
a
great
cold
weather
beer
that
is
light
enough
to
drink
all
day
o
as
i
wrote
in
the
begining
this
beer
was
very
good
nice
slightly
sweet
but
balanced
winter
warmer
kind
of
beer
that
was
very
drinkable
pretty
bitter
for
a
winter
warmer
less
on
the
sweeter
side
with
not
as
much
spices
compared
to
others
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
though
prost
lampertland
o
great
winter
beer
that
is
wellbalanced
with
a
lot
of
complimentary
flavors
a
garnet
hued
beauty
hides
gentle
ruby
highlights
a
lovely
two
finger
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
seductive
dark
malt
presence
but
enough
of
a
spicy
hop
on
the
edges
to
keep
the
aroma
balanced
this
beer
just
smells
like
winter
broad
malt
profile
that
has
hints
of
chocolate
a
touch
of
tobacco
and
coffee
gentle
hops
on
the
crisp
finish
that
makes
me
beg
for
more
this
could
be
my
goto
in
the
winter
warmer
category
despite
its
mildness
resins
in
the
nose
a
little
hot
and
spicy
and
some
buckwheat
a
hard
flavor
to
leave
behind
you
not
my
choice
in
the
winter
beer
competition
but
its
austere
lines
may
appeal
to
some
in
search
of
a
less
malty
christmas
brew
love
this
drinking
2012
batch
a
favorite
from
the
season
a
wonderful
and
unique
balance
of
roasted
toasty
and
hoppy
flavors
delicious
velvety
bittersweet
chocolate
with
a
very
subtle
hint
of
coffee
then
toffee
and
subtle
caramel
malt
touch
of
dark
fruits
crisp
hops
a
hint
of
bubble
gum
in
there
finishes
a
little
crisp
hoppy
and
roasty
kind
of
bittersweet
chocolate
mediumbodied
crisp
and
full
mouthfeel
a
great
winter
session
or
night
cap
doesnt
seem
like
much
of
a
typical
spiced
winter
warmer
to
me
but
sure
has
a
lot
of
great
flavors
that
i
want
in
a
winter
beer
overall
a
good
albeit
simple
example
of
a
hoppy
brown
ale
high
drinkabililty
very
reminiscent
of
grand
tetons
bitch
creek
almost
too
similar
in
the
malt
depart
not
too
sure
what
about
this
other
than
it
being
seasonal
makes
this
a
winter
warmer
if
you
want
something
similarand
better
executed
year
round
definitely
seek
out
the
aforementioned
bitch
creek
this
was
a
solid
beer
however
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
seek
this
out
if
i
was
looking
for
a
winter
warmer
almost
reminded
me
more
of
an
oktoberfest
type
beer
o
a
great
winter
ale
one
of
my
favorites
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
the
style
very
different
but
good
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
hoppy
bitterness
overall
this
is
the
first
time
i
think
i
have
been
disappointed
by
deschutes
brewery
i
just
did
not
pick
up
the
vibe
from
this
brew
at
all
i
am
sure
it
is
a
great
beer
obviously
from
the
reviews
but
i
just
didnt
feel
it
i
will
have
to
drink
a
couple
more
but
past
experiences
have
shown
me
that
only
works
occasionally
moreys
bottom
line
a
good
winter
ale
if
youre
looking
for
something
thats
not
highly
spiced
but
still
speaks
winter
this
beer
is
for
you
a
nice
change
of
pace
within
a
style
that
sometimes
gets
a
bit
repetitive
merry
christmas
o
really
impressive
would
buy
any
time
this
beer
wore
down
on
me
as
it
went
along
and
i
was
really
digging
it
by
the
end
just
a
nice
winter
warmer
pours
dark
amber
with
rubyred
highlights
capped
with
a
bonewhite
two
finger
head
excellent
retention
with
significant
sticky
lacing
caramel
cherry
bouquet
of
fruit
opens
with
caramel
joined
by
varied
fruit
notes
including
dried
apricot
a
hint
of
fig
prune
and
add
accents
of
date
apple
and
pearskin
also
present
a
hint
of
bitter
citrus
cuts
through
fairly
dry
finish
with
slight
chocolate
notes
warming
alcohol
becomes
more
evident
as
the
brew
warms
the
heavier
side
of
mediumbodied
smooth
hint
of
syrup
on
the
edges
moderate
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
thankfully
this
one
is
now
available
in
chicago
overall
nothing
too
flashy
but
thats
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
winter
warmer
robust
flavorful
well
executed
tasty
very
nice
lots
of
things
going
on
and
they
come
together
nicely
absolutely
worth
picking
up
and
ill
be
sure
to
have
another
sixer
before
the
winters
out
deep
brown
to
garnet
red
translucent
body
with
a
sisal
foamy
head
smell
is
caramels
and
chocolates
with
a
faint
fig
very
inviting
taste
is
bittersweet
chocolate
caramel
malty
bread
dried
dark
fruit
dates
plums
fig
newtons
just
a
cusp
of
sweetness
washes
across
the
tongue
on
a
medium
body
that
holds
together
solidly
crafted
with
a
clean
lightly
bitter
lightly
chocolate
finish
i
cant
stop
drinking
this
really
good
no
question
this
is
a
world
class
winter
warmer
a
decent
winter
warmer
the
warming
the
least
of
the
appreciable
attributes
as
the
malt
hops
and
grandfathers
sweater
essences
hold
the
lions
share
of
character
here
good
and
even
better
when
i
look
past
the
glowing
christmas
tree
to
the
snowscape
outside
pour
a
clear
deep
red
bordering
on
brown
with
a
finger
of
dense
creamy
tan
head
this
smells
more
like
a
red
as
i
get
mostly
caramel
with
some
savory
spices
hops
are
citrusy
slightly
piney
and
mild
in
intensity
flavor
is
also
mainly
caramel
with
some
burntbakers
chocolate
there
is
some
cinnamon
or
clove
spiciness
and
piney
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
bitterness
is
pretty
significant
the
feel
is
appropriate
for
the
style
but
i
feel
its
a
little
thicker
than
normal
because
of
the
nitro
tap
finish
is
mostly
balanced
but
slightly
dry
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
in
the
sense
that
i
get
some
spices
but
its
not
crazy
feels
festive
but
its
not
overbearing
would
like
to
try
it
on
regular
tap
or
bottle
for
comparison
big
chewy
malt
bill
must
be
a
maris
otter
base
malt
raisin
and
fig
push
through
the
hops
vanilla
and
caramel
with
a
nice
residual
sweetness
tasty
and
a
very
interesting
one
for
those
hopheads
to
try
first
taste
is
pretty
sweet
at
first
caramelly
toffeeish
flav
a
dark
robust
christmas
ale
let
the
season
begin
folks
scored
this
and
was
definitely
a
fan
poured
pretty
dark
and
had
a
nice
spicy
twist
to
it
caramel
malts
on
the
nose
drinks
with
a
thick
creaminess
up
front
quickly
turning
caramel
hoppy
bitter
balance
it
was
a
little
hoppy
for
my
liking
but
wth
still
was
a
fan
of
the
schlafly
christmas
ale
over
this
one
i
think
o
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
was
pretty
disappointing
and
the
flavor
was
ok
my
least
favorite
from
deschutes
so
far
i
had
this
on
tap
maybe
a
month
ago
and
i
remember
it
being
different
than
this
i
like
this
one
its
different
as
far
as
winter
seasonals
go
not
much
of
a
fruity
or
sweet
malt
profile
but
very
deliciously
bitter
very
commendable
to
the
style
overall
a
solid
malty
sipper
with
good
balance
and
complexity
o
a
really
solid
winter
warmer
decently
rich
and
flavorfull
while
maintaing
drinkability
nothing
exceptionally
memorable
just
a
solid
brownwinter
ale
overall
one
of
the
most
impressive
winter
warmers
ive
ever
had
shares
some
of
the
similar
basic
flavors
as
that
of
their
black
butte
but
in
pure
winter
warmer
form
great
balance
i
cant
believe
ive
been
drinking
deschutes
beers
for
as
long
as
i
have
and
ive
never
tried
the
jubelale
before
i
assure
you
it
wont
be
my
last
m
medium
body
creamy
light
to
moderate
carbonation
jubelale
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
no
head
there
isnt
much
of
an
aroma
some
spices
maybe
some
hints
of
cinnamon
the
taste
is
nice
and
bold
lots
of
spices
good
strong
bold
malty
backbone
a
nice
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
good
full
flavors
rich
taste
overall
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
must
try
o
im
a
deschutes
disciple
but
this
one
ought
to
be
dismissed
i
would
prefer
not
to
have
another
too
bad
there
are
five
more
stashed
in
my
cooler
ill
try
and
pair
them
with
some
holiday
tamales
and
see
if
that
heat
balances
these
out
somewhat
overall
i
wanted
to
try
this
as
deschutes
seems
to
have
some
really
good
products
and
i
wanted
to
see
what
they
produced
for
a
winter
ale
at
6
7
it
serves
a
purpose
for
the
cooler
evenings
its
hearty
enough
for
the
stomach
and
its
mellow
enough
for
the
palate
almost
stoutlike
this
is
a
very
good
brew
a
cross
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
stout
if
you
will
each
aspect
was
very
good
straight
4
5s
in
my
book
but
i
really
liked
the
aroma
i
got
from
it
pours
a
beautiful
robust
copper
with
a
rusty
orange
head
thick
soft
mouthfeel
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
and
relaxing
comfort
in
every
sip
a
mild
but
noticeable
bitterness
through
and
through
with
mellow
but
well
balanced
hops
in
the
background
and
the
kind
of
malty
counterpoint
youd
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
the
alcohol
is
surprising
here
for
6
7
one
can
barely
taste
it
overall
a
great
session
beer
and
even
without
spices
this
beer
represents
the
style
well
nothing
too
spectacular
but
not
a
beer
that
i
would
ever
turn
down
another
quality
mark
from
deschutes
hope
to
see
this
on
tap
soon
o
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
ale
so
glad
deschutes
is
in
missouri
m
medium
bodied
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
25th
anniversary
seasonal
deschutes
did
a
wonderful
job
of
putting
together
a
well
balanced
beer
with
all
the
deliciousness
of
their
seasonal
ingredients
very
impressed
this
could
be
one
of
the
better
seasonals
of
the
year
overall
id
say
that
deschutes
has
once
again
made
a
delicious
beer
and
for
the
most
part
pegged
it
for
the
style
pours
a
deep
red
with
thick
reddish
brown
head
that
sits
at
around
two
fingers
nose
is
super
malty
with
caramel
cinnamon
clove
raisins
nutmeg
figs
some
toffee
a
bit
of
pine
some
kind
of
doughy
scents
in
there
as
well
molasses
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
similar
with
the
spices
more
up
front
clove
figs
cinnamon
nutmeg
raisins
caramel
pine
toffee
dates
and
just
a
tinge
of
hop
bitterness
it
has
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
dry
finish
this
is
a
pretty
excellent
winter
warmer
i
used
to
hate
this
style
but
with
my
love
of
malts
having
developed
over
the
past
2
years
this
tastes
like
its
gonna
be
a
fun
holiday
season
for
brews
once
the
stout
season
ends
which
is
always
my
favorite
beer
season
jubelales
unique
flavor
profile
makes
it
thoroughly
enjoyable
to
drink
contemplatively
but
it
also
makes
it
difficult
to
judge
there
are
elements
a
variety
of
beer
styles
present
in
the
bottle
perhaps
the
most
salient
elements
are
those
of
porter
esb
and
strong
american
pale
ale
tis
the
season
to
be
hybrid
delicious
taste
is
rather
complex
for
a
christmas
beer
begins
slightly
bitter
with
a
roasted
nutty
flavor
which
leads
to
sweeter
caramel
notes
and
then
finishes
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
then
a
light
xmas
spice
very
enjoyable
offering
this
will
be
one
of
my
sought
after
brews
every
year
too
bad
i
live
in
ohio
this
beer
was
nice
but
nothing
special
final
thoughts
im
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
definitely
a
warmer
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
in
the
dead
of
winter
on
a
cold
night
by
the
fire
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
caramelcolored
head
that
has
an
orangish
hue
aromas
are
comprised
of
an
earthiness
and
brown
sugar
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
toasty
butterscotch
and
toffee
flavor
with
a
piney
bitterness
at
the
finish
average
to
slightly
above
average
dark
amber
with
an
off
white
head
aroma
offers
some
caramel
and
toffee
mixed
with
some
winter
spicing
and
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
flavor
follows
suit
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
not
my
favorite
style
and
would
prefer
less
spicing
but
still
decent
worth
a
try
when
i
am
in
the
right
mood
o
good
strong
winter
warmer
imho
especially
if
you
are
not
into
the
whole
spiced
beer
thing
very
drinkable
and
with
the
high
it
almost
drank
like
a
mellowed
out
bigfoot
o
deschutes
has
impressed
me
greatly
again
definitely
my
favorite
winter
warmer
the
amount
of
complexity
is
great
and
the
various
sweet
malt
flavors
complement
each
other
perfectly
o
hard
to
say
i
got
the
whole
picture
on
this
but
i
was
surprisingly
pleased
with
this
great
beer
all
around
and
think
ill
have
to
get
more
of
this
to
enjoy
some
brownie
points
for
having
an
awesome
label
art
if
they
let
this
sit
with
e
belgian
yeast
strain
it
would
be
a
dubbel
o
well
not
my
favorite
not
bad
o
a
must
have
winter
seasonal
i
never
miss
this
one
and
you
shouldnt
either
if
you
like
winter
warmers
but
dont
want
a
cinnamonspice
bomb
this
is
your
beer
a
well
crafted
beer
that
i
anxiously
await
every
winter
a
great
seasonal
release
from
deshutes
this
warmer
isnt
spiced
but
it
feels
like
it
is
theres
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
with
a
fruity
profile
something
akin
to
fig
its
a
little
dry
and
it
definitely
fulfulls
the
warmer
title
solid
release
thats
worth
picking
up
every
winter
d
very
drinkable
really
nicely
balanced
the
spices
are
at
the
right
level
and
there
is
more
than
enough
other
flavor
to
balance
it
almost
has
an
oakey
taste
to
it
at
least
in
the
after
taste
its
just
hitting
me
a
minute
or
so
after
i
took
the
sip
easy
drinker
definitely
could
fill
someone
up
great
beer
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
sampler
glass
pours
a
rich
redish
murky
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
beautiful
lacing
nice
sweet
aroma
dark
fruit
spices
cinnamon
clove
some
dark
roasted
malt
and
sweet
malt
hold
it
all
together
very
similar
to
the
nose
the
flavor
is
malty
with
plenty
of
spice
mostly
cinnamon
with
a
little
brown
sugar
solid
medium
body
with
a
charming
mediumlight
carbonation
that
really
compliments
everything
going
on
without
getting
in
front
of
the
flavors
o
in
a
style
that
varies
widely
from
hop
bombs
to
malt
bombs
and
all
the
way
to
liquid
christmas
trees
this
one
is
quite
good
balance
is
good
with
enough
hops
to
give
a
bit
of
a
bite
and
a
strong
malt
body
full
of
roasty
flavors
with
just
enough
fruityspicy
flavors
to
make
you
reminisce
for
snowy
winter
weekend
afternoons
in
front
of
the
fireplace
definitely
worth
seeking
out
pours
nicely
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
leafy
and
tangy
malty
thing
on
there
actually
there
is
slightly
more
than
a
bit
which
i
could
do
with
less
of
very
smooth
on
the
liquid
with
a
mild
carbonation
a
nice
and
easy
drinker
though
not
really
blowing
me
away
kinda
weird
for
a
winter
ale
smells
malty
and
spiced
tastes
hoppy
the
taste
is
more
bitter
and
less
warm
than
i
was
looking
for
overall
a
very
good
winter
warmer
that
is
well
worth
trying
it
has
a
lot
of
different
flavours
going
on
so
it
stays
interesting
throughout
the
glass
well
crafted
and
very
drinkable
id
buy
it
again
yeasty
body
with
a
bitter
hop
presence
very
slight
blueberries
at
the
very
front
with
creamy
strawberries
further
back
after
warming
up
it
lets
out
its
oaty
caramel
sees
sucker
finish
underneath
its
bitter
ciitrus
hop
bite
o
wonderful
beer
i
love
this
brewery
and
was
not
disappointed
i
gotta
thank
chickenm
for
knocking
a
want
off
my
list
would
make
a
good
industry
standard
for
the
style
its
spiced
well
and
quite
mellow
something
id
drink
again
if
available
in
my
neighborhood
m
not
2
light
or
heavy
good
carbonation
overall
a
great
tasty
beer
among
the
best
for
its
style
reminds
me
of
sierra
nevada
celebration
ale
o
everything
about
this
beer
is
good
looks
like
a
saint
smells
like
nice
childhood
memories
and
tastes
like
warm
pie
this
is
a
winter
nostalgia
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
good
full
bodied
with
a
slight
earthy
tones
good
carbonation
level
it
has
great
sweetness
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
a
really
well
rounded
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
thanks
chugalug06
for
the
nice
extra
o
definitely
warms
good
for
cold
wisconsin
winters
hope
i
get
some
more
sent
to
me
next
winter
overall
lots
of
flavor
and
interesting
but
i
just
dont
think
its
for
me
really
probably
wont
buy
another
but
dont
regret
getting
it
poured
into
a
ommegang
flute
pours
a
dark
red
amber
thin
cream
colored

dissipated
slowly
leaving
a

and
nice

of
roasty
malts
with
well
blended
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
semisweet

very

this
is
an
excellent
winter
warmer
this
is
a
must
revisit
every
year
overall
top
3
for
the
style
not
as
good
as
great
lakes
brewing
christmas
ale
but
what
is
really
a
well
crafted
beer
by
a
worldclass
brewery
on
tap
at
dantes
in
the
university
of
washington
district
in
seattle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
was
dark
amber
to
mahogany
there
was
a
gentle
lacing
with
very
little
head
to
speak
of
as
you
drink
the
lacing
stays
on
the
side
of
the
glass
almost
like
a
christmas
ornament
aroma
was
spicy
with
red
fruits
it
has
a
pretty
sweet
note
to
it
tasted
almost
like
an
abbey
ale
at
first
lots
of
character
and
no
real
surprises
after
the
smell
its
warming
and
drinkable
with
heavy
fruits
cherry
and
minimal
alcohol
burn
almost
spicy
very
crisp
and
drinkable
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
there
is
a
small
bland
aftertaste
but
its
not
that
bad
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
very
festive
beer

its
available

medium
bodied
with
well
integrated
moderately
high
carbonation
feels
pretty
creamy
well
done
brew
overall
such
a
robust
flavor
package
that
may
have
even
more
to
offer
when
first
brewed
will
be
revisiting
next
october
and
stocking
the
fridge
redorange
in
appearance
with
a
nice
head
after
pour
hints
of
earthy
tones
and
a
light
smell
of
burnt
coffee
it
has
a
rough
feel
in
the
mouth
with
a
tast
of
spicy
and
sweet
we
think
it
tastes
strong
then
the
actually
abv
because
of
the
burnt
malt
but
it
is
not
too
overpowering
and
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
o
just
goes
to
show
that
you
cant
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
a
style
of
beer
can
vary
greatly
and
i
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
id
highly
recommend
this
d4
still
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
does
a
decent
job
of
representing
a
winter
warmer
lots
of
subtle
dried
fruit
flavors
to
keep
you
guessing
i
would
personally
like
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
profile
and
maybe
some
cinnamon
spice
id
drink
it
again
c
o
this
is
a
fantastic
ale
i
think
my
favorite
seaonal
i
highly
recommend
it
quite
complex
with
great
hop
and
malt
balance
poured
a
clear
darker
mahogany
color
with
a
small
cap
of
bubbly
whitish
head
caramel
malts
in
the
nose
light
spice
and
a
hint
of
pine
needles
taste
of
sugarscaramel
molassescrisply
piney
and
floral
light
spices
no
really
big
flavor
here
but
a
good
balance
in
all
the
flavors
that
are
present
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
and
surely
an
easy
drinker
i
like
this
beer
but
i
am
not
completely
sure
what
to
make
of
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
just
off
white
head
that
leaves
very
nice
lacing
aroma
is
nice
but
kind
of
weird
billed
as
a
festive
winter
ale
this
beers
aroma
has
a
bit
of
caramel
but
is
overwhelmed
by
a
lot
of
citrusey
hops
this
feels
to
me
like
a
hopped
up
scotch
ale
the
flavor
gives
me
the
same
impression
there
is
some
of
the
smooth
caramel
malty
fullness
that
i
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
moreso
than
in
the
aroma
but
there
is
still
a
big
hop
presence
i
think
that
while
this
is
nice
the
big
hop
presence
clashes
a
bit
with
the
malt
bill
that
they
are
going
with
here
this
beer
is
definitely
interesting
but
i
think
it
would
benefit
from
a
less
aggressive
hopping
schedule
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
will
choose
this
for
my
winter
warmers
this
is
not
so
radical
that
it
shouldnt
be
recommended
to
anyone
i
really
enjoyed
its
complexity
i
enjoy
deschutes
as
much
if
not
more
than
the
next
person
i
mean
i
love
deschutes
every
day
i
mourn
not
being
in
bend
still
but
this
years
jubelale
feels
a
bit
lacking
right
now
o
a
nice
somewhat
complex
and
yet
balanced
winter
warmer
poured
ruby
red
with
a
finger
and
change
of
good
lacing
and
above
average
retention
nose
is
malty
and
fairly
sweet
some
general
spicing
berries
dark
fruits
and
some
generic
winter
ale
characteristics
taste
is
malty
and
fruity
similar
spicing
as
presented
in
the
nose
sweet
warming
malt
notes
with
a
bit

a
touch
of

some

really
compliments
everything
going

without
getting
in

for
a
winter

but
decent
and
good
cask
character
medium

with
moderate
carbonation
really
smooth
and
overall
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
o
an
enjoyable
standard
for
quaffable
winter
warmers
quite
complex
for
a
winter
brew
yet
extremely
balanced
as
well
goes
well
with
any
stew
or
chocolate
cake
during
the
holidays
i
usually
cant
stand
winter
warmers
but
deschutes
once
again
has
made
it
interesting
enough
to
have
great
drinkability
flavor
wise
this
matches
the
expectation
set
by
color
this
beer
is
big
creamy
slightly
nutty
but
also
spicy
super
low
carbonation
way
enjoyable
o
a
nice
winter
beer
that
i
pick
up
every
year
nothing
is
out
of
control
or
out
of
the
box
here
flavors
are
mild
but
still
pleasant
picked
up
a
single
at
princetons
liquors
poured
a
reddishbrown
with
a
short
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
a
rich
mix
of
sweet
toffee
with
light
cinnamon
spice
and
cherryapple
fruit
the
flavor
is
dry
and
finishes
about
as
hoppy
as
any
winter
warmer
ive
tried
theres
a
cutting
citrus
in
the
finish
rolling
over
toasty
bready
grains
the
initial
smooth
fruit
esters
are
a
pleasant
contrast
to
the
bitter
finish
though
not
until
the
beer
warms
up
definitely
on
the
interesting
end
of
the
styles
spectrum
give
it
a
try
cheers
o
a
tasty
and
wellbalanced
winter
warmer
i
was
tempted
to
give
some
5s
may
have
to
when
i
drink
another
one
o
i
enjoyed
drinking
jubelale
while
it
isnt
a
complex
beer
it
also
isnt
too
simple
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
in
the
winter
nothing
really
exceptional
about
this
beer
but
nothing
to
complain
about
its
another
good
winter
warmer

great
to
sip
on
a
cold
night
just
boozy
enough
to
warm
you
up
but
drinkable
enough
to
have
another
doesnt
reinvent
the
wheel
but
a
solid
beer
all
the
same
overall
an
excellent
christmas
style
that
i
wish
i
could
get
at
home
i
popped
the
lid
and
was
greeted
by
christmas
in
a
bottle
jingle
bells
jingle
bells
wow
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
and
watched
as
the
dark
amber
liquid
blossomed
with
2
fingers
worth
of
a
mocha
colored
head
and
amazing
lacing
the
aroma
of
holiday
spices
practically
filled
the
whole
room
one
sip
of
this
beer
and
i
was
sold
this
was
a
solid
brew
the
beer
had
a
wonderful
taste
like
something
akin
to
a
beer
version
of
hot
cider
only
cold
the
spices
were
abundant
but
not
overbearing
and
the
malt
was
perfectly
balanced
with
the
hops
leaving
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
great
beer
not
overly
hopped
and
super
strong
like
other
winter
warmers
ive
tried
i
liked
it
a
lot
and
will
probably
buy
at
least
one
more
six
pack
oanother
very
good
beer
from
deschutes
flavor
drinkability
this
beer
has
it
all
excellent
o
wow
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
the
aroma
is
soft
and
inviting
to
me
and
the
flavor
profile
is
wonderful
with
that
subtle
vanilla
and
cinnamon
the
beer
even
looks
tasty
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
likes
maltier
brews
id
love
to
buy
it
again
cheers
o
a
great
winter
warmer
that
i
enjoy
drinking
every
year
highly
recommended
1990
great
american
beer
festival
the
flavor
has
more
of
the
same
with
a
great
bitterness
contrasting
the
sweetness
some
malty
stone
fruits
and
candied
fruitscandied
apples
maybewith
this
boozy
rumlike
character
that
emerges
as
it
warms
wow
deschutes
has
really
impressed
me
with
this
one
in
fact
this
brewery
has
impressed
me
with
a
bunch
of
their
brews
plan
on
drinking
this
one
for
some
of
these
upcoming
cold
winter
nights
just
try
not
to
chug
it
so
fast
o
this
is
thus
far
my
ideal
winter
warmer
cant
imagine
one
a
lot
tastier
i
could
drink
this
all
night
ill
be
drinking
winter
warmers
for
the
next
week
or
so
well
see
if
anything
can
usurp
it
overall
a
really
nice
winter
ale
decent
name
and
pretty
cool
label
artwork
kind
of
a
pastel
rockwell
sort
of
thing
really
smooth
dry
and
drinkable
but
just
slightly
heavy
for
my
tastes
solid
b
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
caramel
malt
slight
roasted
malt
hint
of
nut
and
a
hint
of
spice
fits
the
style
of
a
winter
warmer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
dryness
tastes
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
coffee
hint
of
spice
coriander
slight
dark
citrus
cherry
slight
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
overall
great
appearance
good
blend
and
good
body
pours
a
dark
maroon
color
with
ruby
hues
and
a
frothy
tan
head
that
left
foamy
lacing
on
the
glass
sweet
candy
like
caramel
malt
with
toast
cocoa
and
cinnamon
fruit
cake
with
citrus
hops
a
hint
of
pine
sweet
malt
and
cinnamon
the
beer
is
nice
and
thick
very
smooth
carbonation
so
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
warming
finish
one
of
the
best
winter
seasonals
ive
had
o
this
is
beer
really
isnt
as
good
as
i
once
remember
i
still
like
it
but
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
like
it
use
to
i
wish
they
nose
was
a
little
better
and
it
doesnt
have
near
the
spices
i
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
overall
drinkability
decent
session
could
do
without
the
metal
and
some
of
the
astringency
overall
it
isnt
too
different
from
other
winter
warmers
ive
had
but
its
mixture
of
flavors
and
drinkability
make
this
a
very
easy
to
recommend
winter
warmer
o
a
good
winter
warmer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
off
in
the
coming
winter
months
its
not
the
top
of
my
list
but
its
good
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewery
overall
the
beer
is
bland
d
im
a
big
fan
of
deschutes
but
wasnt
terribly
impressed
by
this
one
the
abv
isnt
quite
high
enough
to
have
an
impact
and
the
winter
warmer
effect
not
bad
overall
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
reputation
the
nose
promised
more
than
the
taste
delivered
still
enough
to
be
happy
about
id
definitely
try
it
again
o
i
can
clearly
see
how
jubel
2010
comes
from
this
easily
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
the
combination
of
chocolate
with
fruits
and
spice
is
just
so
inviting
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
for
the
colder
months
a
good
holiday
goto
brew
o
outstanding
winter
warmer
wish
i
had
access
to
this
on
the
regular
this
would
pair
well
with
thanksgiving
or
christmas
dinner
great
stuff
randall
overall
this
was
an
excellent
winter
warmer
in
my
opinion
i
picked
this
up
as
a
single
and
now
i
cant
wait
to
grab
a
6
pack
next
time
i
get
a
chance
overall
i
have
enjoyed
this
for
years
this
years
version
seems
a
bit
more
on
the
aggressive
side
but
amazing
you
may
have
friends

this

a
nice
brown
color

a
tan

has
a
nice
retention

leaves
a
little
lacing
this
smells
of
toffee
roasted

roasted
malts
the
feel
is
medium

thick
the
taste
is
excellent
way
way
better
than
the
winter
warmer
i
had
last
week
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
deschutes
beers
it
has
the
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
and
bitter
hop
finish
great
beer
o
great
beer
for
the
pacific
nw
winters
and
a
solid
contribution
to
the
slew
of
winter
ales
wish
it
was
bolder
this
beer
would
be
superb

a
higher

even
better

a
fine
display
of

of
barley
brown
sugar
and
toffee
in
the
taste
robustly
malty
leaving
a
strong
impression
of
chocolate
somewhat
sweet
as
there
is
little
in
the
way
of
hop
bitterness
nice
dry
cocoa
flavor
and
very
light
spice
notes
medium
bodied
feel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
winter
warmer
exceptional
for
the
colder
months
over
all
decent
winter
ale
my
first
loves
for
winter
ales
are
celebration
and
brrrr
so
big
competition
i
do
enjoy
the
creaminess
and
the
unusual
lingering
of
taste
that
comes
after
a
sip
i
think
ill
stick
to
my
favs
i
would
recommend
it
though
gettin
the
winter
warmer
season
started
on
the
early
side
111211
cool
pours
a
dark
red
wood
color
with
a
standard
1
finger
head
nose
and
taste
are
parallel
is
magic
christmas
cookie
biscuity
with
a
gently
spiced
middle
and
a
rare
but
seasonally
appropriate
hop
finish
crisp
for
a
warmer
mouthfeel
is
almost
perfect
hold
it
for
a
minute
gets
all
creamy
and
rich
this
beer
is
gold
yummm
i
am
skipping
the
standard
on
this
this
beer
taste
with
hops
and
crispness
there
is
a
little
burnt
caramel
that
is
great
i
think
this
beer
is
a
must
try
i
know
it
will
be
in
fridge
multiple
times
this
winter
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
amazing
but
decent
i
can
definitely
taste
some
elements
of
jubel
2010
but
a
lot
lighter
version
not
as
flavorful
definitely
try
if
you
like
a
more
watered
down
winter
warmer
but
still
full
of
great
flavor
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
just
a
slightly
above
avg
winter
warmer
with
decent
flavor
and
balance
dr
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
relatively
high
abv
id
like
to
try
it
on
draught
and
as
always
i
look
forward
to
more
beers
from
deschutes
o
im
not
one
for
holiday
ales
but
this
isnt
too
shabby
another
winter
warmer
to
try
from
the
mixed
6
pack
i
liked
this
one
as
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
strong
ale
instead
of
going
overboard
with
wintry
spices
nice
malty
beer
with
a
dry
citrus
finish
would
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
any
time
of
year
o
love
the
warming
feeling
of
this
beer
it
has
a
deep
malty
body
with
a
great
balance
of
a
northwest
hop
profile
the
strange
alcohol
harshness
also
detracts
greatly
on
the
palate
this
is
not
something
i
will
probably
ever
pick
up
again
absolutely
loved
this
one
not
overly
herb
or
spice
profile
but
big
malt
and
sweet
dried
fruit
among
my
favorite
winter
warmers
along
with
samuel
smiths
winter
welcome
very
different
though
delicious
and
highly
recommended
overall
this
might
be
my
favorite
winter
warmer
and
another
excellent
job
by
deschutes
on
making
great
beer
that
i
love
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
overall
this
is
a
nice
solid
beer
the
appearance
is
very
hard
to
grade
because
it
has
a
nice
body
the
lacing
followed
me
almost
all
the
way
down
the
glass
and
the
head
was
big
and
it
looked
pretty
nice
when
i
first
poured
it
however
the
head
didnt
last
very
long
and
it
left
this
weird
patchy
bubbly
array
of
bubbles
on
top
of
the
body
this
beer
probably
deserves
a
4
5
for
appearance
but
im
going
to
bump
it
down
to
a
4
because
the
bubbles
looked
bad
and
they
kinda
just
freaked
me
out
o
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
i
would
not
want
this
much
hops
from
a
winter
warmer
but
everything
else
is
decent
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
would
drink
this
if
it
was
available
o
its
one
dimensional
but
i
enjoy
all
the
flavors
it
has
worth
a
shot
overall
this
is
a
new
favorite
among
winter
ales
and
another
notch
for
deschutes
on
my
top
breweries
list
balanced
and
very
drinkable
yet
flavorful
a
bit
light
for
the
style
but
some
may
like
that
ill
be
getting
this
again
cheers
all
in
all
an
excellent
beer
o
great
drinkable
winter
warmer
one
of
the
best
in
terms
of
values
as
well
since
the
price
is
quite
fair
overall
love
this
beer
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
i
look
forward
to
this
every
year
well
done
deschutes
nice
beer
for
the
season
if
lacking
in
heft
o
a
hoppy
and
nice
winter
warmer
that
is
almost
reminiscent
of
a
sweet
esb
aging
notes
i
tried
this
next
to
a
oneyear
old
bottle
and
the
yearold
bottle
had
a
fantastic
nose
but
the
taste
was
quite
vegetal
phenolic
and
just
mostly
unpleasant
do
not
age
this
beer
this
is
just
a
classic
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
every
fall
can
down
couple
of
pints
easily
very
very
tasty
brew
o
ive
never
had
a
winter
warmer
before
but
this
is
definately
a
winner
the
head
sticks
around
even
as
im
typing
this
end
part
very
smooth
malty
delicious
definately
gets
better
as
it
warms
o
not
loving
this
beer
as
i
do
every
other
deschutes
release
ive
had
dont
know
if
its
the
style
or
what
its
not
bad
for
sure
just
not
great
maybe
it
needs
to
be
winter
goes
good
with
pasta
o
fall
is
here
with
this
one
o
awesome
brew
i
look
forward
to
this
one
every
year
o
i
think
this
beer
tastes
better
slightly
aged
than
having
it
fresh
worthy
of
being
cellared
for
at
least
a
year
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
has
a
very
good
taste
that
was
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
out
there
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
around
o
this
is
a
good
alternative
to
those
big
stouts
and
barleywines
when
the
weather
turns
cool
now
i
just
need
to
try
this
again
when
its
fresh
o
a
really
nice
winter
warmer
id
love
it
on
a
cold
night
review
from
tasting
notes
february
2011
pours
a
clear
garnet
with
a
soapy
head
i
think
thats
the
perfect
descriptor
for
the
look
of
this
beer
ill
put
it
up
against
the
best
of
them
nose
is
fairly
hopforward
a
bit
of
malt
heft
reminds
me
of
an
aggressively
hopped
american
style
barley
wine
this
might
actually
be
the
first
winter
warmer
ive
ever
had
wow
flavor
is
strangely
dry
very
welcoming
in
that
way
pine
cone
and
forest
floor
are
the
hop
qualities
but
they
are
very
nicely
tempered
a
faint
saplike
quality
i
really
enjoy
the
perfect
attenuation
here
fairly
thin
feel
way
better
than
i
expected
overall
its
really
good
especially
for
the
price
goes
well
with
chinese
food
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
a
beer
that
i
would
have
guessed
is
a
winter
warmer
which
doesnt
always
happen
with
this
style
the
cpj
medium
bodied
with
a
prominent
peppery
spice
presence
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
over
the
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
notes
into
a
lingering
dry
finish
slight
herbalmedicinal
with
only
a
touch
of
the
buttery
character
found
in
the
aroma
very
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
biscuit
toffee
toast
and
rye
im
also
picking
up
hints
of
cherry
raisin
plum
and
grape
complex
but
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
spices
for
my
liking
the
lack
of
boozinessheat
helps
drinkability
but
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
flavor
not
my
favorite
deschutes
beer
but
one
12oz
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
me
o
glad
i
got
another
shot
at
this
one
much
better
fresh
still
nothing
crazy
but
enjoyable
winter
warmer
deschutes
can
do
no
wrong
in
my
book
jubelale
is
a
solid
tasty
well
crafted
winter
beer
i
normally
prefer
a
spicier
winter
warmer
but
jubelale
brings
a
balanced
profile
that
leaves
me
with
not
much
else
to
ask
for
overall
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
d
this
winter
warmer
is
a
straightforward
contribution
to
a
style
of
typically
oddducks
it
features
a
strong
malt
presence
and
a
touch
of
yeasty
fruit
but
spices
seem
to
be
out
of
the
picture
the
dryness
on
display
here
is
unexpected
and
remarkable
for
the
style
while
not
really
anything
special
by
deschutes
standards
it
is
satisfactory
simply
by
not
being
an
embarrassing
mess
reminds
me
of
another
one
of
my
winter
time
faves
gi
xmas
ale
this
one
has
a
bit
more
hops
and
little
less
belgian
candy
flair
but
outstanding
regardless
loved
it
and
this
might
age
for
a
year
or
so
very
well
might
try
it
myself
very
impressed
and
highly
recommended
overall
a
good
version
of
the
style
and
a
great
beer
for
the
colder
months
i
just
wish
i
got
to
it
sooner
boy
this
is
an
odd
one
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
style
really
spicy
and
dry
and
light
its
a
bit
too
parching
in
my
palate
for
me
to
really
get
into
but
it
has
some
real
good
qualities
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
that
only
gets
better
the
more
it
warms
up
medium
carbonation
easily
drinkable
and
sessionable
in
the
colder
months
d
quite
good
very
smooth
and
all
that
but
it
doesnt
quite
stack
up
to
some
of
the
other
seasonal
beers
that
are
just
as
easy
to
find
out
here
d
definitely
not
impressed
it
was
a
fine
tick
but
i
definitely
will
never
seek
this
out
again
it
was
a
challenge
for
the
last
quarter
of
my
glass
to
go
down
i
had
to
let
my
palate
revive
itself
from
the
final
drinks
before
that
though
went
through
it
pretty
much
like
most
unassuming
average
brews
d
i
dunno
how
many
of
these
i
could
drink
before
wanting
to
check
out
something
else
its
ok
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
not
the
best
but
still
a
very
pleasant
beer
as
others
have
noted
perhaps
a
bit
weak
on
the
malt
front
a
good
winter
warmer
although
id
prefer
if
it
had
more
of
a
malt
presence
d
perfect
for
a
winter
night
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
very
well
balance
and
not
an
overly
spiced
winter
warmer
this
is
horrible
and
needs
to
be
dumped
even
more
opening
it
really
interesting
for
a
christmas
seasonal
a
good
amount
of
spice
and
hops
as
it
poured
into
a
nice
dark
orange
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
and
head
i
didnt
really
feel
the
festive
ale
as
much
as
some
of
the
other
beers
ive
had
around
this
time
but
it
did
have
some
good
spices
and
taste
d
almost
reminiscent
of
a
hoppy
amber
ale
with
a
hint
of
spicing
its
nice
to
have
a
winter
warmer
that
doesnt
bombard
your
tastebuds
with
spices
very
tasty
and
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
to
any
fan
of
winter
warmers
no
need
for
this
to
be
seasonal
as
it
would
be
drinkable
ay
time
of
the
year
ive
got
a
soft
spot
for
dechutes
i
thought
this
was
great
one
of
those
beers
with
a
big
load
of
malt
to
lend
some
backbone
to
the
hops
ala
three
floyds
i
could
drink
the
whole
6
of
this
right
now
if
they
only
distributed
farther
east
this
is
huge
drinkable
and
enjoyable
winter
seasonal
that
has
eluded
me
for
a
long
time
but
was
worth
while
after
scoring
a
case
cheers
overall
good
drink
and
a
nice
enjoyable
ww
d
truly
exceptional
instead
of
the
typical
spice
bomb
that
masks
may
winters
this
is
characterized
by
the
candied
fruit
and
rich
malty
flavour
with
a
fantastic
hop
balance
truly
exceptional
aroma
is
fig
spice
medley
caramel
and
dark
bread
taste
is
rum
raisin
thin
steely
caramel
plum
and
chocolate
muffin
toned
down
hop
spice
with
a
pharmaceutical
lean
id
like
a
chewier
mouthfeel
i
suspect
this
beer
is
at
the
end
of
its
lifeline
nice
beer
cant
complain
and
would
eagerly
grab
one
if
offered
another
win
from
deschutes
d
pretty
good
a
tasty
beer
another
good
one
from
deschutes
personally
i
have
never
been
that
impressed
by
winter
warmers
but
this
is
really
something
else
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
wine
glass
nice
thick
coffee
black
color
with
a
thick
cocoa
head
smells
like
coffee
toffee
cinnamon
and
a
whole
kitchen
of
spices
the
taste
is
sort
of
a
combination
between
toffee
and
spice
that
balances
out
to
be
not
spicy
at
all
but
just
a
smooth
beer
that
is
real
drinkable
a
tasty
winter
treat
for
desert
that
goes
great
with
chocolate
dark
brown
colored
brew
not
easy
to
see
through
but
it
looks
pretty
clear
small
tan
head
lots
of
lace
pretty
big
malt
scent
candy
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
roast
kinda
has
a
bit
of
a
brown
ale
taste
but
its
better
than
most
browns
in
my
opinion
some
nut
tones
some
candy
sweetness
a
bit
of
bittering
hops
and
perhaps
some
other
spices
thin
to
medium
mouth
pretty
wet
the
more
ive
drank
of
it
the
more
it
reminds
me
of
a
brown
so
if
youre
into
those
then
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
try
but
that
style
isnt
my
thing
d
nice
little
winter
warmer
not
my
favorite
but
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
man
flexabull
throwing
curveball
after
curveball
answer
is
a
bottle
of
jubelale
from
deschutes
i
got
to
try
a
bit
of
this
at
my
homebrew
clubs
last
meeting
along
side
some
super
jubel
2010
we
tasted
over
35
beers
that
night
so
my
recollection
is
a
bit
hazy
however
i
feel
like
ive
enjoyed
it
more
tonight
than
i
did
then
thanks
again
paul
d
dark
fruit
maybe
be
least
favorite
flavor
profile
but
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
though
the
dark
fruits
are
in
the
spotlight
they
arent
overbearing
or
linger
too
long
drink
i
will
probably
come
back
to
this
if
i
see
it
on
the
shelf
of
my
local
liquor
store
i
really
like
it
while
eating
jubelale
beer
cheese
soup
highly
drinkable
could
do
a
few
of
these
if
needed
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
here
really
nice
appearance
with
a
great
foamy
head
and
lots
of
lacing
nose
is
not
all
that
complex
but
does
have
a
nice
combo
of
sweet
and
malt
components
flavor
is
characterized
less
by
the
malt
and
more
by
the
other
components
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
d
this
is
a
good
beer
i
acquired
one
in
a
trade
with
gkunkle
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
mix
of
spice
and
hops
seems
a
bit
harsh
not
sure
if
my
bitter
senses
are
over
active
today
not
all
that
impressed
more
toasted
brown
malt
in
the
flavor
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
browned
apple
flesh
holiday
spices
and
fresh
hops
very
bold
and
aggressive
for
the
style
yet
jubelale
pulls
back
and
lets
each
flavor
come
through
at
any
given
time
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
nearing
fullbodied
but
the
spoton
carbonation
level
keeps
things
from
getting
cloyingly
sweet
and
syrupy
all
in
all
a
top
notch
wc
winter
warmer
from
the
skilled
hands
at
deschutes
i
grab
a
six
pack
every
winter
and
should
try
to
find
some
more
before
spring
2011
rolls
around
d
could
drink
a
six
of
these
no
problem
m
mediumlight
bodied
somewhat
lacking
in
the
body
felt
a
little
watery
to
me
taste
is
quite
spicy
and
flavorful
theres
some
nice
dark
malt
character
to
it
and
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
with
light
but
sharp
carbonation
theres
a
slight
warming
from
it
thats
nice
as
well
this
nut
brown
holiday
special
really
warms
the
heart
pours
a
nice
chocolate
color
with
one
finger
of
off
white
head
the
smell
is
of
roasted
barely
and
chocolate
the
taste
starts
strong
of
chocolate
and
malt
and
then
finishes
with
some
slight
hoppy
bitterness
the
finish
is
very
smooth
and
makes
the
beer
very
drinkable
good
winter
beer
for
those
fans
of
brown
ales
merry
christmas
everybody
md
a
little
thinner
than
expected
but
i
would
still
call
it
medium
bodied
booziness
is
a
touch
too
much
to
score
real
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
medium
bodied
slightly
higher
carbonation
sticky
and
dry
in
feel
a
nice
combo
of
spice
and
hops
which
makes
for
a
solid
drinking
winter
warmer
although
the
nose
was
pretty
muted
d
a
solid
to
great
winter
warmer
rich
and
smooth
without
being
too
strong
perfect
for
tonite
a
few
days
before
xmas
had
this
on
tap
at
the
deschutes
brewpub
in
portland
pours
a
copperamber
colour
with
thin
offwhite
head
some
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
hops
caramel
with
some
classic
winter
spices
spice
level
isnt
overpowering
as
some
north
american
winter
warmers
are
very
nice
a
solid
winter
warmer
that
marries
tradition
with
the
hopheavy
tendencies
of
its
geographic
origin
really
good
i
want
this
again
this
is
a
winter
seasonal
standout
not
sure
how
to
describe
it
but
it
just
tastes
like
the
holidays
make
sure
you
try
it
this
winter
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
i
loved
jubelale
its
a
unique
winter
ale
that
has
the
perfect
amount
of
hops
i
dont
get
to
enjoy
deschutes
very
often
they
dont
sell
in
wisc
but
jubelale
gives
them
a
good
name
out
here
7
for
a
6
er
is
a
good
price
so
the
value
is
there
definitely
try
it
along
with
some
other
seasonals
single
picked
up
at
the
store
to
try
this
years
version
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
nice
sized
head
good
lacing
smell
had
a
wonderful
cinnamon
scent
to
it
taste
was
great
i
picked
up
notes
of
fruits
like
apples
pears
and
oranges
plus
lots
of
spices
like
brown
sugar
and
cloves
mouthfeel
was
moderately
thick
but
also
smooth
highly
drinkable
this
is
how
winter
warmer
beers
should
be
brewed
wish
this
beer
was
available
back
in
ma
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
apple
cider
colored
reddish
brown
with
a
fluffy
2
finger
slighlty
tan
head
sweet
smelling
faintly
of
honey
along
with
caramel
slight
citrus
hop
notes
in
the
nose
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
very
smooth
flavored
with
notes
of
slight
roast
some
bitterness
and
citrus
some
pine
like
bitterness
as
well
makes
itself
known
at
the
end
slight
lace
on
the
glass
no
real
alcohol
present
in
the
nose
or
taste
over
all
a
nice
beer
but
lacks
any
sort
of
in
your
face
flavors
but
thats
what
is
kind
of
nice
about
it
too
drinkability
very
solid
great
scents
and
flavors
and
really
the
only
detractor
i
can
find
in
it
is
the
rather
harsh
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
if
a
bit
more
of
the
malty
sweetness
held
up
in
this
it
may
have
scored
just
a
tad
higher
i
think
if
i
manage
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
they
may
go
in
the
closet
for
about
6
months
to
see
if
the
malts
develop
more
drinkability
this
will
probably
open
up
even
better
as
it
warms
up
but
great
balance
great
flavor
lots
of
depth
and
body
without
being
overbearing
d
i
bought
a
sixpack
then
a
case
then
another
best
beer
of
the
season
in
my
book
too
bad
winter
will
turn
to
spring
d
i
would
love
to
drink
another
when
feeling
thirsty
i
was
well
pleased
with
this
beer
d
great
this
is
a
good
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
but
there
is
plenty
of
prickly
carbonation
to
go
around
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
sweeter
beers
like
this
and
this
one
didnt
change
my
mind
although
it
was
nice
to
give
this
holiday
ale
a
try
on
a
cold
december
night
the
beer
went
down
silky
smooth
it
left
a
nice
bitter
hop
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
as
well
as
some
roasty
caramel
flavour
perhaps
a
hint
of
nut
i
can
imagine
the
drinkability
would
be
great
as
well
overall
a
great
beer
which
defies
categorization
my
review
for
this
is
rather
lackluster
because
this
simply
didnt
impress
me
which
is
odd
because
ive
always
considered
deschutes
to
be
a
pretty
darn
good
brewing
company
as
a
beer
in
and
of
itself
its
decent
as
a
winter
ale
its
somewhat
disappointing
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
its
just
okay
this
is
a
very
yummy
example
of
the
category
id
recommend
it
highly
the
nose
was
a
disappointment
but
otherwise
this
is
a
pretty
solid
seasonal
the
average
abvlow
for
the
stylemakes
this
wonderfully
sessionable
all
in
all
im
thrilled
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
jubelale
one
of
my
standard
fallbacks
on
nitro
deliciously
creamy
which
works
beautifully
with
the
flavors
of
jubelale
i
could
easily
go
for
a
few
more
of
these
the
flavors
arent
quite
as
pronounced
as
in
past
years
albeit
possible
the
nitro
tap
may
have
effected
that
somewhat
regardless
its
still
a
solid
brew
if
you
are
more
of
a
hophead
this
could
be
a
good
intro
beer
to
the
category
im
still
left
wanting
for
more
malt
and
spices
mfd
mouthfeel
and
drink
are
both
good
mouthfeel
is
full
and
this
is
a
tasty
brew
d
not
terrible
but
forgettable
easy
to
get
through
fast
to
move
on
to
something
else
overall
the
deep
smoky
burnt
flavor
is
just
a
little
too
overpowering
for
me
it
really
becomes
the
focus
of
this
beer
for
me
and
i
just
dont
like
it
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
a
massive
two
and
a
half
inches
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
thick
cap
of
rocky
lacing
this
beer
looks
fantastic
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
and
well
integrated
dark
spices
the
taste
is
spicier
than
the
aroma
with
a
lot
of
ginger
but
there
is
enough
of
a
malt
presence
to
keep
things
from
going
out
of
whack
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
ive
had
in
a
long
while
i
will
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
jubelale
is
the
taste
of
winter
not
too
heavy
not
too
sweet
extremely
sessionable
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
its
pretty
good
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
above
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
drinkability
is
good
especially
for
the
style
i
usually
find
the
beers
of
the
style
too
spiced
or
too
sweet
this
one
however
balances
everything
very
nicely
and
allows
all
of
the
flavors
to
shine
at
one
time
or
another
very
good
beer
overall
not
a
great
winter
warmer
would
accept
it
in
the
future
if
offered
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
the
best
things
about
this
in
my
opinion
d
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
so
far
deschutes
never
disappoints
fd
smooth
and
a
little
carbonated
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
not
too
drinkable
for
me
i
believe
ill
pass
on
my
next
opportunity
to
drink
this
festive
winter
ale
overalloverall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
winter
warmer
had
it
by
a
warm
fire
and
once
again
dechutes
didnt
dissapoint
good
brewery
good
beer
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
impression
leave
the
spices
in
the
cupboard
this
is
what
a
real
winter
warmer
should
taste
like
top
notch
notes
this
is
a
good
all
round
winter
warmer
my
only
complaint
is
that
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
but
thats
forgiveable
in
an
otherwise
good
beer
ive
liked
everything
ive
tried
from
deschutes
and
jubelale
is
no
exception
in
fact
its
probably
one
of
my
favorites
its
too
bad
i
only
bought
one
bottle
because
i
could
definitely
drink
more
of
this
those
of
you
that
love
a
nice
malty
beer
on
cold
nights
should
definitely
give
jubelale
a
try
this
is
a
well
constructed
beer
all
components
are
well
balanced
and
contribute
constructively
to
the
experience
i
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
this
bad
boy
is
a
mini
jubel
2010
without
all
the
lasting
flavors
of
the
jubel
it
starts
licoricey
with
raisins
and
finish
with
a
hint
of
hops
its
a
good
beer
in
this
style
but
not
my
favorite
drink
it
was
a
good
12
oz
and
i
could
see
a
6er
falling
very
easily
on
this
one
the
pour
is
a
dark
red
and
brown
with
a
tan
head
very
frothy
foam
on
top
the
taste
is
quit
bitter
at
first
and
its
easy
to
feel
the
piney
flavors
its
definitely
a
winter
beer
with
the
sharp
sting
in
the
taste
a
bit
earthy
and
possibly
some
fruit
in
the
mix
the
best
thing
about
the
beer
is
not
the
taste
however
its
the
smell
deschutes
jubelale
pours
a
beautiful
deep
red
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
aroma
malty
with
some
toffee
and
roasted
notes
there
is
a
nice
earthy
herbal
and
mildly
citrusy
and
piney
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
bitter
and
malty
with
out
being
overly
sweet
more
roasted
character
comes
through
in
the
flavor
with
some
piney
earthy
hops
the
beer
almost
tastes
mildly
spiced
but
it
might
be
because
i
expected
it
to
be
drinkability
flavors
are
not
too
complex
and
not
overpowering
enough
to
be
a
put
off
this
combined
with
a
low
abv
can
make
for
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
oddly
enough
for
all
the
bad
things
i
say
about
it
i
still
drink
it
again
and
again
and
i
dont
know
why
maybe
its
my
unhealthyrelationship
beer
you
keep
returning
to
it
hoping
things
will
get
better
d
a
ruby
amulet
clear
and
inviting
with
a
beautiful
head
that
creams
the
tulip
the
aroma
is
lush
and
inviting
a
bit
of
chocolate
some
raisins
dash
of
caramel
notable
and
pleasant
pine
and
citrus
very
wellbalanced
hopforward
winter
the
bitterness
slams
you
into
the
snow
while
the
caramel
sweetness
and
pine
and
citrus
hops
rub
it
in
your
face
very
chewy
for
its
medium
thickness
i
shall
be
enjoying
these
all
day
mouthfeel
medium
body
not
thick
or
chewy
this
is
probably
my
goto
beer
during
late
fallearly
winter
despite
it
lacking
a
defining
characteristic
i
wish
it
were
yearround
but
after
all
it
is
a
winter
warmer
i
enjoyed
it
more
on
nitrotap
than
i
have
on
regular
draft
or
bottles
would
like
to
try
it
on
cask
as
well
so
hopefully
i
dont
miss
my
window
of
opportunity
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
kind
of
has
a
filling
quality
that
i
wouldnt
care
for
in
a
sixpacks
worth
but
on
its
own
is
just
fine
d
despite
the
seemingly
negative
attributes
this
beer
went
down
quickly
matter
of
factly
the
wife
just
asked
did
you
finish
your
beer
already
it
was
good
i
think
i
am
just
disappointed
as
i
continue
my
search
for
a
beer
with
more
of
the
seasonal
taste
meaning
cinnamon
clove
nutmeg
anything
that
reminds
me
of
the
holidays
another
gift
from
the
west
this
beer
presented
itself
in
a
much
darker
condition
of
an
ale
smell
was
a
mix
of
light
citrus
carmel
and
toasty
bread
once
it
hit
my
lips
the
hops
took
over
and
gave
way
to
a
biscuity
sweet
finish
good
mouthfeel
in
full
essence
of
the
season
in
the
end
a
really
drinkable
ale
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
feeling
this
is
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
but
is
too
hoppy
and
dry
for
the
style
dark
crimson
color
with
a
large
dense
head
that
had
excellant
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
impressive
malty
aroma
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
alcohol
and
a
little
citrus
the
hops
make
more
of
a
showing
in
the
taste
as
all
60
ibus
are
detectable
one
of
the
most
bitter
winter
warmers
i
have
come
across
the
bitterness
balances
out
the
sweet
chocolatety
malt
some
fruity
esters
add
a
level
of
complexity
alcohol
is
felt
and
adds
some
warmth
the
body
feels
a
little
light
for
all
the
malt
and
flavor
going
on
carbonation
is
nice
a
truely
warming
winter
warmer
hoppy
and
malty
and
fantastic
looking
opinion
this
is
really
a
good
beer
overall
it
is
really
clean
but
has
a
solid
flavor
profile
that
doesnt
leave
the
palate
wanting
for
hardly
anything
the
spice
is
a
welcome
component
but
may
be
a
tad
much
either
way
i
like
this
beer
and
wouldnt
mind
enjoying
it
again
in
the
future
give
it
a
shot
if
you
can
find
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
if
you
like
the
old
alewinter
warmer
styles
of
beer
d
based
on
this
albeit
narrow
experiment
of
these
two
bottles
i
can
say
that
jubelale
did
not
hold
up
very
well
over
the
year
this
may
have
just
been
batch
variation
and
its
still
drinkable
but
the
09
is
a
completely
different
beer
than
the
10
if
you
already
knew
this
congratulations
im
apparently
slow
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
place
to
age
a
few
bottles
from
your
sixpack
you
wont
find
any
room
in
my
cellar
drink
it
fresh
score
represents
fresh
version
upon
reading
some
other
reviews
maybe
this
beer
needed
to
warm
up
a
bit
more
obviously
i
have
to
finish
out
this
sixer
so
next
time
ill
let
it
warm
up
a
little
more
and
see
if
it
seems
a
bit
less
harsh
or
if
all
else
fails
let
someone
else
drink
it
very
good
a
really
nice
holiday
beer
o
good
but
not
great
d
pretty
good
but
lacks
the
abv
to
really
tackle
the
stickiness
of
the
malt
one
an
evening
is
definitely
enough
linger
3
this
a
a
definite
warmer
ive
had
only
a
few
sips
and
im
already
feelin
nice
and
cozy
this
is
a
sipper
that
should
be
enjoyed
rather
slow
this
beer
is
a
dark
mahogany
with
reddish
edging
the
head
is
full
and
an
almost
orange
color
with
tan
mixed
in
the
smell
was
not
distinct
and
did
not
make
much
of
an
impression
mostly
some
sweet
sugars
and
a
touch
of
spice
the
taste
was
good
picked
up
mainly
on
toffee
definite
caramel
candy
sugar
and
malts
there
was
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
and
some
hops
in
the
background
this
medium
bodied
brew
is
well
done
and
would
be
perfect
for
a
christmas
party
or
other
occasion
with
noncraft
beer
drinkers

favorite
winter
warmers
d
damn
good
simple
beer
d
very
drinkable
beer
recommend
picking
it
up
smooth
with
lots
of
flavor
deschutes
jubelale
pours
a
finger
of
sticky
tan
foam
over
an
almost
opaque
black
brew
held
to
bright
light
a
bright
light
a
deep
rosy
brew
and
steady
carbonation
is
revealed
the
nose
is
toasty
dark
malt
with
a
fruity
note
and
a
little
bright
hop
spiciness
up
front
the
flavor
is
dark
sweet
malts
and
that
fruity
note
again
balanced
by
spicy
herbal
hops
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
long
hoppy
aftertaste
this
is
a
fairly
hoppy
ale
but
balanced
by
rich
sweet
dark
malts
how
they
make
feel
so
light
is
beyond
me
its
that
note
of
fruit
though
that
makes
this
a
winter
holiday
beer
though
otherwise
it
would
still
be
a
pretty
good
hoppy
brown
ale
i
love
the
label
art
by
the
way
its
the
work
of
oregon
artist
natasha
bacca
drinkability
complex
and
flavorful
excellent
sugar
notes
a
bit
warm
and
would
be
great
with
some
age
jubelale
is
not
syrupy
not
astringent
not
to
thin
or
thick
it
is
a
great
blend
of
malts
and
hops
and
the
english
ale
yeast
they
use
as
their
house
yeast
makes
the
most
drinkable
winterstrong
ale
ive
tried
in
the
last
few
years
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
lots
of
flavors
going
on
something
that
might
be
an
interesting
experiment
in
the
cellar
along
the
lines
of
anchors
our
special
ale
though
really
good
fresh
without
a
doubt
something
i
highly
recommend
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
lead
off
sweetness
and
a
nice
finish
without
an
aftertaste
the
spice
level
is
nice
and
gives
it
a
tea
like
flavor
to
the
whole
thing
i
enjoyed
it
for
a
winter
warmer
its
pretty
good
i
dont
mind
the
beer
but
i
definitely
remember
enjoying
last
years
better
not
bummed
i
got
a
6er
but
that
will
probably
be
it
for
me
this
season
d
i
refuse
this
beer
whenever
it
is
offered
i
would
rather
go
sober
than
drink
this
beer
again
im
not
a
fan
of
novelty
beers
in
general
but
this
one
is
pretty
decent
its
a
slightly
cloudy
red
ale
that
pours
with
a
smallish
tan
head
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
flavors
with
just
a
hint
of
holiday
flavoring
somewhere
between
citrus
and
evergreen
jubelale
is
not
going
to
become
one
of
my
regular
beers
but
ill
probably
buy
some
now
and
again
during
the
fallwinter
season
id
put
it
in
the
top
20
among
all
beers
and
ales
ive
tasted
poured
into
a
sniffer
color
consisted
of
a
dark
garnet
hue
with
a
one
inch
smokey
tan
head
smell
is
consistent
with
the
style
picked
up
mainly
rum
raisin
fresh
wheat
toast
and
some
sticky
figs
taste
was
heavy
on
the
malt
and
finished
with
a
distinct
hops
character
overall
very
drinkable
beer
warming
int
the
way
down
d
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
from
deschutes
verdict
very
good
reasonably
priced
winter
ale
worth
having
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
when
its
available
good
beer
jubelale
is
a
decent
winter
ale
and
id
drink
it
over
a
domestic
but
at
least
this
years
2010
batch
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
notes
this
beer
is
medium
to
full
bodied
flavorful
and
has
just
enough
alcohol
warmth
to
make
the
long
winter
nights
seem
a
bit
shorter
this
could
be
my
favorite
seasonal
release
from
deschutes
jubelale
is
an
awesome
beer
and
one
that
i
will
never
turn
down
when
offered
it
d
good
dry
clean
spicy
and
flavorful
quite
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
especially
on
the
cooler
nights
drinkability
very
good
example
of
an
english
strong
ale
that
has
been
ramped
up
on
hops
the
spicy
floral
english
hop
bitterness
is
just
slightly
offputting
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
complex
beer
for
the
winter
great
progression
and
complexity
of
flavors
in
this
brew
i
enjoyed
it
last
winter
but
this
time
around
im
appreciating
it
much
more
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
hops
with
just
the
faintest
hint
of
caramelized
sugar
the
flavour
is
more
balanced
with
the
smoky
coffee
flavour
that
deschutes
does
so
well
blended
with
hops
and
something
malty
the
beer
finishes
dry
with
just
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
it
seems
to
improve
as
it
warms
the
flavours
becoming
more
distinct
not
terribly
drinkable
for
for
my
money
though
just
a
touch
too
dry
d
awesome
i
love
how
dry
it
is
its
perfect
for
the
season
it
tastes
like
a
yule
log
light
and
dry
while
still
being
roasty
and
warming
delicious
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
great
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
musthave
winter
seasonal
from
deschutes
that
is
damn
tasty
good
work
from
deschutes
2010
release
pours
a
very
dark
rubyamber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
scent
is
very
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
dark
fruit
aromas
i
get
very
little
hops
but
a
nice
amount
of
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
surprisingly
hoppier
than
expected
after
the
bitterness
i
get
sweet
candied
sugar
flavors
with
sweet
malts
there
is
a
slight
caramel
and
nutty
flavor
as
well
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
great
for
a
winter
brew
even
though
its
still
hot
here
in
fresno
drinkability
is
fairly
high
a
tasty
seasonal
seasonal
from
deschutes
but
i
believe
they
change
the
recipe
slightly
every
year
if
so
this
years
was
not
my
favorite
good
but
a
little
boozy
and
the
hops
arent
as
well
integrated
as
i
seem
to
remember
maybe
this
is
one
that
i
prefer
with
a
little
age
on
it
but
i
remember
liking
this
beer
more
last
year
okay
cold
but
much
better
warm
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
with
fantastic
taste
i
think
its
the
peaty
taste
as
i
do
love
a
good
scotch
ale
but
it
is
still
a
complex
and
highly
enjoyable
ale
i
always
have
a
hard
time
resisting
picking
up
a
six
pack
when
theyre
on
sale
picked
up
a
12
pack
of
this
on
my
way
back
from
seattle
and
i
was
surprised
in
a
good
way
how
much
this
beer
tasted
different
than
i
remember
it
when
i
drank
it
in
the
late
90s
it
seemed
to
be
slightly
spicy
and
now
it
tastes
like
a
cascadian
ale
with
lots
of
hops
and
a
dark
malt
backbone
lovely
to
look
at
with
a
big
head
and
reddish
brown
colour
the
beer
has
a
full
mouthfeel
that
opens
up
to
show
the
hops
but
still
feature
the
malt
that
defines
this
varied
style
overall
quite
a
nice
winter
warmer
better
than
most
d
sensational
im
trying
to
make
the
12pack
which
i
bought
for
11
99
by
the
way
last
a
while
so
i
can
see
how
the
aging
affects
it
but
im
having
a
hard
time
great
beer
d
for
a
winter
warmer
this
is
on
the
hoppy
side
and
overall
very
drinkable
the
lingering
bitterness
is
nice
but
also
a
bit
off
for
me
for
winter
i
like
it
a
bit
maltier
this
years
is
the
best
years
i
have
had
i
dont
know
if
it
is
in
my
mind
or
what
but
i
am
really
enjoying
it
this
year
my
favorite
seasonal
of
this
season
currently
had
it
on
tap
and
bottle
and
it
is
amazing
in
both
go
out
and
get
some
also
like
the
artwork
on
the
bottle
this
year
this
beer
is
at
its
best
just
below
room
temp
served
too
cold
and
the
little
nuances
of
the
flavor
are
completely
lost
the
creamy
feel
and
flavor
notes
make
this
an
exceptional
brew
this
year
a
great
pairing
beer
something
that
should
be
sipper
shared
and
savored
with
friends
and
family

a
fireplace

d
good
winter
beer
in

summer
hahaa
really
held
up
well
after
4
years
will
probably
try
to
find
some
more
bottles
d
a
very
tasty
winter
brew
i
got
this
one
in
a
winter
sampler
pack
i
got
on
clearance
and
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
ones
in
the
box
i
would
purchase
this
one
again
when
it
is
in
season
drinks
like
a
brown
ale
no
spiced
flavor
but
good
taste
the
jubelale
pours
an
amber
color
very
thin

no

glass
much
of
the
nose
is
winter

round
out
the

taste
is
slightly
alcoholic
with
raisins
and
prunes
plenty
of
spices
linger
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
spicy
while
thin
drinkability
is
good
even
way
outside
of
the
season
for
this
brew
i
could
definitely
handle
several
of
these
drinkability
drinkable
but
no
need
for
another
pours
a
moderate
copper
color
with
a
decent
white
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
good
deal
of
citrus
hops
especially
for
the
style
a
little
bit
of
fruit
in
there
as
well
the
taste
was
fairly
nice
and
much
better
than
the
nose
the
nose
was
certainly
a
bit
weak
when
compared
to
the
taste
although
the
general
components
were
quite
similar
mouthfeel
was
a
little
bit
too
light
good
drinkability
especially
for
a
winter
warmer
my
favorite
generic
winter
beer
that
is
out
in
stores
this
is
my
rock
whenever
i
would
go
out
to
buy
a
darker
beer
this
is
what
i
would
grab
first
although
it
is
a
dark
beer
it
is
so
smooth
that
even
my
friends
who
had
never
liked
dark
beer
liked
having
jubelale
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
d
so
good
i
started
my
second
one
before
10
am
pours
copper
brown
with
slight
head
aroma
is
malted
and
roasted
flavor
is
roasted
and
dark
with
dark
fruit
cherry
and
dark
caramel
finish
has
a
woody
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
assertive
but
not
excessive
drinkable
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
was
good
and
sharp
slickness
in
the
mouth
gave
way
to
a
dry
finish
this
ones
definitely
worth
a
try
c
a
lovely
beer
that
i
would
sit
down
over
a
long
evening
with
friends
and
drink
though
not
one
of
my
top
winter
warmers
this
medium
bodied
brew
gave
me
an
interesting
mix
of
candy
sweetness
and
the
more
expected
bitterness
towards
the
end
as
it
warmed
the
alcohol
content
became
more
apparent
but
it
did
not
detract
from
the
flavor
tasty
malty
juiciness
up
front
but
jubleale
has
the
hops
to
balance
it
out
bakers
chocolate
like
bitterness
takes
me
to
the
finish
where
a
slight
alcohol
note
lingers
providing
the
warming
effect
yum
still
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
reminds
of
a
lightly
spiced
slightly
more
fruity
version
of
an
american
brown
amped
just
enough
to
add
some
flavor
but
still
feels
immensely
drinkable

not
bad
but
seemed
a
bit
underpowered
for
a
true
winter
warmer
i
should
note
that
i
have
never
tasted
this
beer
before
so
needless
to
say
i
never
had
a
fresh
version
that
would
be
an
interesting
comparison
to
this
aged
version
which
i
enjoyed
overall
not
the
best
winter
warmer
but
it
did
catch
me
a
bit
off

little
too
much
on
the

side

me

jubelale

dark

with
a

nice

only
a

the
end
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
nothing
too
outstanding
but
nothing
missing
either
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
overly
dark
and
heavy
but
still
very
flavorful
enough
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
not
too
heavy
the
spicy
qualities
make
it
perfect
for
christmas
eve
this
was
my
first
time
drinking
jubelale
and
although
they
could
probably
stand
to
take
it
a
little
easier
on
the
hops
in
this
one
it
stacks
up
pretty
well
against
most
of
the
other
winter
warmers
out
there
and
lives
up
to
deschutes
high
standard
d
very
enjoyable
winter
ale
seems
stronger
than
6
7
happily
drink
two
in
one
sitting
better
than
most
winter
seasonal
beers
i
would
get
another
sixpack
this
winter
to
me
its
a
mediumbodied
beer
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
i
was
surprised
at
how
simple
this
beer
is
i
had
a
different
set
of
expectations
the
6
7
abv
doesnt
over
power
the
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
d
not
a
bad
holiday
ale
although
the
aroma
is
definitely
more
pleasant
than
the
actual
flavor
i
found
this
to
be
drinkable
but
a
bit
muddled
and
too
thick
and
syrupy
overall
great
representation
of
the
style
consistently
solid
beer
that
works
well
on
those
cold
winter
nights
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
thick
cookie
dough
colored
head
with
some
serious
retention
covers
a
thoroughly
redamber
brew
smells
of
citrus
hops
primarily
though
also
a
bit
of
holiday
spice
the
hop
isnt
too
pronounced
in
the
taste
but
is
well
balanced
with
malt
sweetness
and
spice
good
stuff
my
favorite
seasonal
thus
far
in
09
m
syrupy
viscous
thick
and
coats
the
mouth
carbonation
ripple
o
wonderful
beer
hints
of

from
the
noble
hops
round
out
the
flavor
nicely
notes
i
had
a
jubelale
a
few
years
back
and
didnt
enjoy
it
however
this
was
very
pleasing
a
fantastic
winter
warmer
so
many
layers
and
complexities
a
nice
malty
backbone
that
is
countered
by
a
great
combo
of
hops
the
website
says
this
is
60
ibus
but
you
couldnt
tell
by
tasting
it
very
nicely
balanced
and
incredibly
smooth
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
and
very
unique
highly
recommend
d
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
but
id
have
to
say
thats
more
because
of
my
dislike
of
the
caramel
malt
flavors
than
anything
else
so
if
youre
into
those
types
of
flavors
youll
probably
dig
this
one
taste
the
raisin
strong
and
black
licorice
more
muted
really
come
through
in
the
aged
beer
they
combine
with
the
malty
smoothness
and
the
right
touch
of
hops
to
really
make
you
want
to
throw
a
sixer
of
juble
09
into
a
vault
and
just
wait
to
summarize
my
brother
is
a
good
person
and
jubelale
ages
really
really
well
taste
is
strong
caramelised
fruits
prunes
esp
spicey
raisiny
alcohol
a
faint
whiskeyish
hint
and
hint
of
rum
light
burnt
citrussy
bitterness
orange
grapefruit
some
light
toastiness
almost
chocolatey
fruit
jelly
candy
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
overtly
so
and
not
harsh
bringing
with
it
the
faintly
whiskeyrum
elements
and
spicey
warm
raisiny
alcohol
that
blend
well
with
the
rest
feel
is
good
firm
with
faint
oiliness
yet
not
heavy
syrupy
or
truly
oily
the
taste
of
this
beer
really
does
not
do
much
for
me
really
surprised
by
deschutes
as
all
their
other
offerings
have
really
impressed
toasty
malts
mingle
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
pine
resin
hop
bite
but
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
here
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
it
is
not
very
warming
meh
as
usual
deschutes
made
another
excellent
brew
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
if
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
huge
head
but
i
wasnt
very
careful
in
how
i
poured
it
probably
should
have
poured
a
bit
slower
has
a
scent
of
holiday
spices
and
lots
of
hops
tastes
like
citrus
like
a
lot
of
west
coast
hops
beers
do
with
a
lot
of
holiday
spices
yummy
i
could
drink
these
all
evening
if
werent
so
strong
love
the
flavor
nice
but
a
bit
too
much
hops
for
what
i
expected
md
cloying
but
not
to
the
point
of
undesirability
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
dominates
but
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
the
flavor
is
a
deal
breaker
everything
was
lined
up
perfectly
to
be
a
very
solid
holiday
beer
the
off
taste
ruined
the
drinking
experience
i
could
not
get
past
it
i
would
try
this
one
again
as
i
am
not
convinced
what
i
am
tasting
is
what
was
intended
but
at
this
time
this
one
is
not
for
me
brown
color
pouring
from
the
bottle
very
red
almost
purple
in
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
alcohol
and
fruit
no
alcohol
heat
in
the
taste
though
there
is
an
earthy
flavor
that
stands
out
and
grabs
attention
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
malt
and
hops
a
touch
of
tart
fruit
in
the
finish
makes
this
a
very
nice
beer
other
than
black
butte
porter
i
havent
had
many
from
this
brewery
but
this
beer
makes
me
realize
i
need
to
try
more
from
deschutes
would
like
to
session
this
next
year
would
i
buy
more
of
it
until
deschutes
comes
to
massachusetts
i
wont
be
able
to
get
anymore
of
this
tasty
stuff
i
will
have
to
rely
on
trading
and
the
occasional
trip
to
the
west
coast
to
satisfy
my
need
for
deschutes
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
alcohol
warming
smooth
and
a
light
astringency
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
except
i
feel
it
leans
more
towards
a
hoppier
version
i
like
a
good
winter
warmer
to
have
a
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
spice
i
got
the
spice
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
lacking
i
enjoy
a
good
dechutes
beer
but
this
one
is
just
okay
d
very
drinkable
and
i
plan
on
having
atleast
a
few
tonight
from
the
6
pack
i
bought
earlier
d
spicy
and
malty
not
the
worst
but
could
be
better
the
abv
is
fairly
well
hidden
overall
i
likes
this
winter
warmer
from
deschutes
would
get
it
again
very
sessionable
one
of
the
better
seasonals
this
year
drinkability
very
drinkable
ipa
drinkable
good
cold
night
hopped
seasonal
poured
a
darker
ruby
crimson
color
with
a
medium
off
white
head
smelled
of
oranges
lemon
peel
and
clove
taste
surprised
me
this
years
version
seemed
hoppier
than
last
years
i
am
a
hophead
for
sure
but
this
tasted
like
it
should
have
been
more
balanced
the
hops
have
a
very
leafy
earthy
taste
to
them
which
i
didnt
think
meshed
well
with
the
style
could
have
been
more
creamy
malty
and
complex
like
last
years
maybe
it
was
too
fresh
it
could
mellow
so
much
more
with
a
few
months
on
it
honestly
this
beer
tasted
like
an
american
amber
ale
since
its
listed
as
a
winter
warmer
it
will
be
judged
as
suchan
above
average
beer
but
only
an
average
example
of
the
style
pretty
consistent
sometimes
inversion
and
mirror
pond
lack
consistency
drinkability
from
my
limited
experiences
with
the
style
its
nice
to
have
a
standard
by
which
to
measure
others
meh
at
best
overall
its
not
super
complex
but
a
good
beer
nice
balance
alcohol
is
hidden
time
to
start
drinking
the
christmas
beers
this
one
pours
dark
amber
with
an
initial
inch
of
light
tan
head
smells
of
caramel
lots
of
malts
and
slightly
floral
hops
tastes
sweet
and
malty
again
caramel
slightly
floral
with
a
faint
bitter
hop
finish
body
is
medium
slightly
creamy
with
ample
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
brew
that
is
highly
sessionable
this
beer
finishes
nicely
with
a
good
rich
caramel
malt
that
hangs
on
the
palate
and
spicy
floral
notes
of
hops
and
classic
winter
spices
this
is
a
great
drinker
for
the
winter
months
and
will
be
enjoyed
all
through
the
season
drinkability
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
very
interesting
beer
and
easily
drinkablesessionable
despite
it
being
a
relatively
decent
abv
beer
glad
i
picked
up
the
six
pack
that
i
spotted
while
in
downtown
los
angeles
i
am
currently
sitting
outside
on
my
balcony
in
low
60s
weather
enjoying
this
thoroughly
just
cold
enough
outside
to
feel
like
im
back
home
in
the
midwest
enjoying
a
cool
autumn
evening
cheers
everyone
i
like
it
and
its
cheaper
than
other
microbrews
im
from
co
and
im
used
to
paying
8
9
bucks
a
pop
for
a
sixer
this
one
was
9
and
its
from
deschutes
if
you
have
jubliation
ale
from
odell
around
go
with
that
but
if
thats
not
there
go
with
this
one
drinkability
highly
drinkable
for
a
high
abv
winter
beer
too
drinkable
really
my
memories
of
last
years
new
years
eve
party
are
distinctly
hazy
due
to
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
full
that
is
nice
and
creamy
taste
kicks
it
up
a
notch
with
some
spices
added
a
bit
of
malts
and
a
more
notable
hop
presence
is
noted
somewhat
reminscent
of
arrogant
bastard
in
a
way
without
the
robust
hopping
not
bad
3
0
d
would
not
be
bad
at
all
if
it
had
some
body
lots
of
licorice
herbed
anise
and
mocha
come
through
great
texture
a
little
better
i
think
than
the
bottle
version
drinkability
packed
with
flavor
and
yet
smooth
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
since
it
is
not
as
heavy
and
filling
as
some
others
even
though
the
abv
is
6
7
saw
my
favorite
local
natural
foods
store
has
this
on
sale
for
6
49
a
sixpack
so
i
will
be
stocking
up
to
share
this
festive
ale
poured
cool
into
a
glass
this
shows
a
hazy
mahogany
color
with
a
big
oatmeal
bubblage
on
top
and
chunky
lace
the
aroma
is
delicious
chocolate
raspberry
wheat
with
peaty
malt
and
rye
the
flavor
is
bright
piney
hops
and
herbal
malt
tangy
bread
complexity
that
is
tough
to
pin
down
but
very
good
very
drinkable
with
a
relatively
middle
body
feel
and
some
resinous
qualities
tastefully
carbonated
all
around
drinkably
enjoyable
yule
tide
goodness
well
done
drinkability
very
nice
i
had
this
with
a
ham
dinner
had
a
really
nice
winter
dinner
made
me
feel
all
christmassy
will
drink
again
definitely
good
winter
beer
while
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
winter
warmers
because
of
the
strange
spices
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
with
enough
hops
and
subdued
spices
to
make
it
a
truly
enjoyable
brew
glad
i
picked
it
up
and
will
do
so
in
the
future
years
to
come
tastes
of
roasted
malts
grape
with
a
lot
of
smokiness
and
a
slight
hop
kick
body
is
on
the
think
side
extremely
well
balanced
with
decent
drinkability
the
fact
that
this
brew
is
so
well
balanced
is
a
slight
disappointment
to
me
as
i
would
have
liked
more
prominent
flavors
to
come
through
especially
in
the
middle
not
bad
for
what
it
is
a
really
drinkable
subtle
well
done
holiday
beer
with
the
finesse
of
a
beer
from
a
great
brewery
like
deschutes
bright
flavors
perfectly
balanced
both
in
bitterness
and
spiciness
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
3
long
winters
i
spent
in
oregon
and
the
many
many
beers
consumed
during
those
odd
times
d
another
decent
seasonal
i
hope
it
does
go
on
sale
so
i
can
have
an
excuse
to
buy
a
bunch
more
d
i
could
drink
this
one
all
the
way
until
christmas
non
stop
seriouly
i
only
have
one
bottle
and
wish
i
had
more
because
this
is
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
very
good
holiday
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
and
hop
balance
and
not
too
much
holiday
spice
this
is
the
finest
product
deschutes
has
released
since
the
last
abyss
period
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
special
its
a
little
out
of
balance
and
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
those
who
like
the
roast
bitterness
will
probably
enjoy
it
more
than
i
drinkability
pretty
sessionable
affordable
and
a
nice
well
masked
calm
abv
glassware
pint
d
a
very
enjoyable
winter
offering
from

really
like
the
balance
and
complexity
of
this
one
a

nicely
done

with

no

of

with
some
notes

taste
is
very
comforting
with
loads
of
caramel
and
toffee
malt
with
some
light
dry
fruits
body
is
fuller
then
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no

well
done
though
additional
dry

notes
would
have
benefited
this
beer
overall
check
this
brew
out
d
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
for
a
winter
beer
but
that
is
just
my
opinion
i
could
see
why
people
would
like
this
huge
huge
drinkability
and
i
am
thankful
for
this
brew
i
will
be
buying
a
lot
of
it
this
year
the
flavor
is
great
and
the
time
is
just
right
medium
body
with
some
fluff
and
fullness
to
the
mouth
good
carbonation
and
good
punch
from

make
this

a
pleasure
too
consume
the

bottle
this
is
a
fairly
murky
dark
brown
beer
with
a
substantial
head
on
it
about
an
inch
tall
despite
a
gentle
pour
the
aroma
is
dark
cocoa
caramel
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
and
a
nice
spicy
hop
aroma
the
malt
takes
a
background
seat
to
a
high
bitterness
which
i
wasnt
expecting
malt
is
still
present
with
a
nice
caramel
roast
after
a
moment
finish
is
roasty
and
dry
over
all
this
beer
is
pretty
good
drink
ability
is
high
especially
for
a
winter
warmer
most
might
say
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
at
over
6
months
old
but
i
find
it
good
still
hops
arent
as
powerful
as
earlier
but
still
very
much
present
looking
forward
to
buying
more
of
this
beer
in
the
fall
poured
cool

mixed

some

keeps
all
the
spice

in
check
some
sweetness
and
slight
nutty
flavors
in
the
finish
mouth
is
somewhat
light
and
slick
in
nature
this
goes
down
easy
and
the
spices
and
roasted
flavors
are
not
cloying
at
all
liquid
bread
in
nature
very
well
done
this
is
a
great
beer
today
and
would
be
an
excellent
choice
to
hang
out
by
the
fire
with
in
the
cold
winter
months
i
would
sure
seek
this
out
again
d
a
great
winter
warmer
one
to
pick
up
every
christmas
season
for
sure
oh
my
wow
whoa
now
that
i
didnt
expect
at
least
from
the
aroma
i
was
not
expecting
a
big
bitter
hit
but
there
it
is
this
is
like
a
maltbutter
bomb
of
a
brittish
esb
with
a
wack
over
the
head
of
bitterness
to
it
some
citrusy
fruitiness
to
it
but
not
a
lot
enough
to
knock
the
score
down
and
the
bitterness
is
just
a
bit
much
to
be
in
balance
so
tone
down
the
hops
a
bit
and
youre
probably
well
on
your
way
to
an
awesome
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
great
head
retention
aroma
is
thick
on
the
malt
and
just
slightly
piny
the
taste
of
the
malt
comes
through
immensely
very
bready
and
grainy
tastes
like
it
came
straight
out
of
the
fermenter
and
into
my
mouth
very
fresh
mouthfeel
compliments
the
taste
just
a
tad
bit
heavy
continuing
to
appreciate
the
bold
aroma
of
this
one
it
seems
to
balance
and
mellow
as
it
warms
or
as
i
drink
drinkability
a
little
too
heavy
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
but
otherwise
fantastic
keep
it
up
deschutes
d
i
wouldnt
mind
if
it
was
winter
all
year
long
to
be
able
to
drink
this
m
d
soft
carbonation
and
a
bigger
body
fairly
full
somewhat
rich
alcohol
comes
across
a
little
hefty
though
its
only
6
7
d
a
very
good
winter
brew
look
forward
to
it
every
year
i
could
drink
many
of
these
and
have
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
another
case
or
two
this
season
if
it
were
available
its
one
id
look
for
every
winter
the
first
sip
is
a
nice
mix
of
spices
and
slightly
fruity
it
is
a
full
bodied
taste
but
not
too
thick
perfect
for
winter
in
the
northwest
and
not
too
spicy
like
a
lot
of
other
winter
ales
but
also
warming
it
almost
reminds
me
of
dates
in
that
it
is
slightly
fruity
and
sweet
but
not
in
overpowering
way
it
provides
a
very
nice
balance
aging
did
this
one
well
i
really
enjoyed
it
fresh
but
the
aging
made
this
very
smooth
and
mellow
very
nice
stuff
great
winter
warmer
that
isnt
just
a
mouthful
of
spice
like
some
others
can
be
great
balance
very
drinkable
and
just
plain
tasty
d
this
is
a
very
nice
change
from
the
normal
plethora
of
winter
warmers
which
can
really
be
just
about
anything
as
long
as
you
put
a
christmas
tree
on
the
label
this
is
like
an
overly
hoppy
belgian
dubbel
with
all
of
the
fruit
toffee
and
mild
spice
definitely
a
winter
brew
to
keep
on
hand
each
season
overall
its
in
the
same
level
as
sn
celebrator
one
of
the
midpriced
goto
winter
brews
i
will
look
for
d
a
very
nice
seasonal
celebration
but
not
exactly
christmas
morning
overall
i
expected
more
from
this
one
its
drinkable
but
there
just
isnt
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
pretty
mild
as
far
as
winter
warmers
go
pours
a
deep
brown
color
this
beer
looks
amazing
i
mean
it
looks
like
its
gonna
warm
me
up
when
i
drink
it
nice
light
tan
head
with
moderate
lacing
smells
of
malt
with
some
floral
hoppy
notes
taste
starts
out
sweet
caramel
and
then
goes
to
the
floral
and
citrus
of
the
hops
specifically
some
orange
zest
very
full
beer
perfect
on
a
cold
winter
day
a
nice
brown
looking
ale
with
a
hoppy
deep
malty
nose
and
taste
its
not
very
complex
my
only
taste
compaint
and
a
bit
thin
for
my
likes
but
it
has
the
good
hoppy
brown
ale
feel
for
a
winter
brew
maybe
it
just
needs
a
bit
more
of
the
malt
get
it
up
to
8ish
percent
for
a
real
winner
overall
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
back
in
november
08
and
i
have
to
say
its
way
better
on
draft
who
knows
if
this
six
pack
sat
warm
and
in
the
sun
for
some
time
before
it
was
refrigerated
this
is
a
very
quaffable
winter
warmer
not
sweet
and
alcoholic
as
some
can
be
i
love
the
biscuity
and
roasted
flavors
in
this
beer
a
very
balanced
winter
beer
enjoy
it
on
draft
if
you
can
overall
this
beer
is
good
it
tastes
good
and
id
definitely
drink
more
but
its
not
as
sweet
as
i
feel
a
winter
warmer
should
be
and
generally
its
not
very
assertive
for
this
style
nor
is
there
any
noticeable
warming
effect
going
on
in
light
of
all
this
i
think
jubelale
could
actually
be
passed
off
as
a
porter
afterall
more
than
anything
else
its
mild
smooth
and
chocolateythe
color
is
the
only
major
unporterlike
thing
this
makes
me
kinda
disappointed
in
deschutes
as
one
of
the
original
powerhouse
northwest
breweries
they
can
do
better
if
i
want
another
6pack
of
winter
warmers
this
season
it
will
not
be
jubelale
i
wish
there
was
more
of
a
selection
for
the
style
as
this
is
the
only
one
i
think
that
i
have
tried
and
it
is
fantastic
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
and
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
beers
with
decent
spice
profiles
this
one
pulls
it
off
extremely
well
and
im
impressed
overall
drinkability
a
good
beer
overall
goes
down
very
easy
d
its
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
and
other
notes
texture
and
body
gives
this
a
major
thumbs
up
on
drinkability
i
have
to
say
that
i
even
enjoyed
the
taste
and
feel
of
the
creamy
head
in
some
moments
the
hops
bit
through
the
malts
more
than
others
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
overwhelming
or
unbalanced
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
but
i
would
easily
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
this
style
deep
caramel
flavors
died
down
hops
and
grainy
flavors
in
addition
to
too
much
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
are
the
story
of
this
beer
a
sense
of
alcohol
lingers
and
deminishes
the
quality
of
this
beer
and
im
assuming
that
the
rubber
scent
my
nose
found
is
caused
by
this
alcohol
presence
thin
and
sticky
mouthfeel
if
offered
another
glass
id
have
to
pass
unless
handed
to
me
by
the
brewmaster
himself
from
a
fresh
batch
overall
one
of
my
least
favorites
from
deschutes
i
havent
totally
figured
out
what
i
like
in
a
winter
warmer
deschutes
definitely
went
for
the
roasty
hoppy
interpretation
not
bad
but
im
still
looking
for
something
more
ideal
id
like
it
better
if
it
was
less
bitter
and
more
balanced

the

is
very

just
right
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
winter
warmers
im
glad
its
come
to
texas
finally
poured
into
straight
pint
glass
poured
with
a
1

however
there
was
sufficient
carbonation
for
a
bigger

if
desired

an
attractive

head
dissapated
quickly
leaving
a
nice

bold
spicy
aroma
that
is
very
pleasing
flavor
matches
aroma
well
with
a
lingering
roasty
spicy
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
slightly
thinner
body
than
the
style
should
have
very
drinkable
if
you
like
a
slightly
stronger
beer
for
a
session
this
would
work
well
another
strong
entry
from
a
strong
brewery

deep
ruby

a
small
dirtty
white

is
spicy
with
tons
of
roasted
and
heavily
toasted

taste
is
lots
of
crystal
malts
that
you
can
easily
taste
other
tasting
notes
were
maple

faint
coffee
and
a
spiciniess
to
it
mouthfeel
was
good
abv
is
obvious
but
well
hidden
and
overall
good
a
good
warmer
as
usual
jubel
ale
is
always
good
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
it
seems
a
tad
unbalanced
not
even
close
to
being
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
but
still
a
decent
beer
this
beer
has
the
perfect
delicate
blend
of
malts
and
spices
for
great
balance
and
complexity
this
is
my
pick
of
the
litter
for
christmas
ales
this
year
d
pleasantly
complex
enough
to
stay
interesting
without
growing
tired
of
all
the
flavors
not
a

beer
pours
a

smooth

with
solid

in
the

a
good

with
some
nice

easy
to
drink
and
one
i
look
forward
to
every
year
d
i
enjoy
drinking
this
ale
it
is
full
flavored
and
balanced
definately
one
i
will
have
again
this
one
is
nice
and
substantial
in
the
mouth
with
some
sweetened
coffee
toasted
malt
flavor
baked
apple
hot
dark
bread
some
nutty
brownale
flavors
are
complemented
by
the
pineyherbal
hops
that
lend
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
d
good
seasonal
better
than
most
ive
had
as
mentioned
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
english
pale
ale
or
brown
ale
esp
the
finish
flavor
of
this
beer
really
comes
out
as
it
warms
im
sure
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
smooth
and
works
well
with
spicy
foods
too
pours
hazy
deep
copper
in
color
with
a
single
finger
head
that
dissipates
to
a
foamy
ring
rather
quickly
no
lacing
to
note
the
nose
is
delicous
roasted
malts
with
a
mild
amount
of
spice
and
toasted
nuts
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
minus
the
toasted
nuts
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
many
others
in
the
genre
but
so
is
the
abv
i
would
say
it
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
the
higher
abv
winter
warmers
the
roasted
malt
character
and
the
mild
spice
compliment
each
other
well
drinkability
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
it
was
decently
drinkable
but
a
little
too
dry
a
little
too
heavily
spiced
and
a
little
too
uninteresting
its
worth
a
try
though
even
if
its
not
one
that
id
go
back
to
a
year
in
the
bottle
has
produced
excellent
results
but
i
wouldnt
go
much
longer
feel
free
to
prove
me
wrong
though
cheers
and
happy
holidays
bottle
pours
a
semi
hazy
dark
maroon
color
with
a
medium
lived
beige
head
smell
is
toffee
tart
malt
and
belgian
yeast
like
spiced
character
smells
like
a
dubbel
taste
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
dubbel
as
well
with
some
dark
fruity
malt
flavors
and
a
yeasty
spice
component
that
i
am
not
too
big
on
good
rich
body
and
soft
to
medium
carbonation
but
the
flavor
is
not
my
favorite
still
well
done
though
d
i
could
easily
have
3
or
4
bottles
of
this
in
a
sitting
it
goes
down
very
well
dvery
nice
full
of
flavour
lots
going
on
with
this
one
but
one
is
enough
maybe
a
bit
too
busy
d
good
seasonal
hoppy
beer
goes
down
remarkably
easy
for
such
a
low
price
single
a
far
above
average
beer
terrific
seasonal
paired
well
with
some
ghiradelli
chocolates
and
cranberry
bread
that
im
snacking
on

brown
hioghlights
and
a
thin
tan

nutty
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
bit
of
spice
nutmeg
cinnamon
flat
mouthfeel
a
truckload
of
caramel
malt
lingers
throughout
which
the
hops
have
the
fight
through
some
coffee
and
roasted
malt
it
really
keeps
true
to
a
english
strong
ale
without
falling
into
the
esb
category
id
call
this
a
more
than
drinkable
beer
and
id
highly
recommend
it
to
beer
lovers
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
this
is
a
review
of
the
2008
version
pours
clear
red
brown
with
thick
offwhite
head
very
good
looking
leaving
a
decent
lace
really
not
much
to
improve
on
there
clean
malty
aroma
with
caramel
a
little
hops
and
a
hint
of
banana
nice
full
flavor
of
roasted
malt
and
bitter
hops
with
a
good
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
not
as
spicy
as
some
of
the
other
winter
beers
but
that
is
fine
with
me
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
carbonation
and
slightly
alcoholic
finish
this
is
one
i
am
always
sure
to
buy
come
december
great
by
a
warm
fire
or
paired
with
holiday
main
courses
this
beer
could
be
pounded
by
those
who
enjoy
the
bitterness
it
is
not
huge
but
it
isnt
wimpy
thin
either
i
find
it
easy
to
drink
but
the
bitterness
could
slow
down
some
happy
thanksgiving
md
for
such
a
hopped
brew
i
would
expect
some
mouth
drying
effects
but
actually
it
was
pretty
mild
and
there
is
a
slight
bittersweet
feel
left
in
the
mouth
but
the
hops
are
definitely
left
on
the
breath
the
drinkability
is
very
good
and
will
go
very
well
with
my
turkey
tonight
thought
this
was
a
brown
ale
after
i
poured
it
aroma
is
fairly
light
and
creamy
not
much
alcohol
in
the
smell
roasted
flavors
and
caramel
you
would
not
guess
it
were
6
7
based
on
smell
and
taste
they
mite
want
to
bump
it
up
to
7
2
for
a
better
winter
warmer
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
impression
as
someone
who
tends
to
favor
the
hops
i
like
this
seasonal
quite
a
bit
it
is
more
aggressive
than
a
lot
of
winter
ales
i
would
say
it
is
wholly
sessionable
going
down
very
smooth
another
winner
from
deschutes
in
the
mouth
its
wellcarbonated
wellattenuated
and
wellasdlkfated
just
a
nicely
crafted
mildly
spiced
hopforward
winterstyle
brew
its
70
degrees
in
phoenix
but
still
pours
a
wonderful
tan
colored
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
malt
and
spices
initial
taste
is
wonderful
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
nice
roasty
background
but
then
the
head
dies
down
and
the
for
some
reason
so
does
the
taste
hard
to
explain
but
its
missing
some
body
and
some
malt
taste
ok
recommended
winter
warmers
arent
my
favorite
beers
but
i
will
admit
that
this
is
pretty
darn
good
jubelale
pours
a
dark
auburn
with
a
handsome
beige
head
it
smells
of
chocolatey
malt
and
holiday
spices
but
its
a
tad
weak
the
taste
shows
off
these
flavors
better
i
was
most
impressed
that
while
it
tastes
of
winter
spices
it
doesnt
try
too
hard
or
taste
artificial
at
all
the
flavor
is
blended
into
the
beer
far
better
than
many
holidaytime
special
ales
the
feel
is
less
watery
than
expected
and
holds
up
better
than
similar
beers
i
can
definitely
see
enjoying
a
jubelale
or
three
on
a
cold
december
night
the
label
is
quite
arty
which
i
appreciate
but
the
artist
perceives
winter
a
bit
different
from
me
anyway
i
like
deschutes
brewery
theyre
big
but
they
still
keep
it
interesting
while
avoiding
the
superfluous
the
drinkability
is
good
i
could
have
several
more
just
wish
i
did
not
have
to
travel
to
denver
to
get
it
put
then
again
it
is
okay
overall
a
very
nice
effort
even
with
the
slightly
higher
abv
i
could
wrap
up
several
of
these
pretty
quickly
pours
a
mahogany
amber
color
with
a
full
finger
foamy
light
tan
head
that
decomposes
like
an
ice
cream
float
a
good
amount
of
lacing
from
the
top
right
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
sweet
dark
fruit
molasses
and
spices
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
full
flavored
the
figgy
raison
taste
is
complimented
by
a
mild
coriander
spice
a
real
nice
drinker
the
6
7
abv
is
well
integrated
taste
is
watery
at
first
lots
of
spice
some
sour
malt
some
hops
in
the
back
a
little
caramel
and
ends
a
little
bitter
d
pretty
good
nice
seasonal
but
not
an
all
the
time
kind
of
beer
pours
a
rich
chestnut
and
dark
puffy
white
head
settles
to
a
18
inch
with
big
sticky
rimming
the
glass
smells
fruity
of
figs
maybe
some
plums
maraschino
cherries
rummy
alcohol
taste
is
a
nice
rich
mix
of
flavors
up
front
is
sort
of
a
cherry
and
citric
acid
bite
which
falls
off
into
more
of
a
caramel
and
plum
duff
malt
flavor
ginlike
juniper
notes
acidic
hop
bite
sticks
around
and
melds
with
a
strong
burnt
character
that
i
cant
shake
even
though
i
kind
of
want
to
thinner
than
i
expected
though
not
watery
drinks
well
despite
the
aftertaste
which
actually
grows
on
me
as
i
get
through
the
glass
i
might
get
some
more
i
might
not
well
see
d
a
good
winter
session
beer
probably
my
favorite
winter
warmer
yet
the
bottle
poured
dark
rich
amber
with
mahogany
highlights
fluffy
well
sustained
tan
head
settling
into
a
pillowy
sheet
its
got
rich
chocolate
malty
nose
with
sweet
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
its
a
delicious
brew
with
intense
roasted
bitterness
falling
back
on
acidic
hoppyness
well
rounded
caramel
sweetness
with
adequate
carb
and
velvety
mouthfeel
but
it
does
not
hold
well
to
warming
you
gotta
try
this
d
i
thought
this
beer
was
spot
on
perfect
for
the
winter
season
my
only
regret
was
not
pulling
the
trigger
on
a
case
instead
of
a
six
appearance
has
a
dark
brown
amber
with
a
fair
head
and
nice
lace
smell
is
bready
caramel
with
dark
malts
and
a
touch
of
smoke
taste
is
rich
in
malts
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
that
slides
down
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
just
as
remembered
from
previous
yrs
as
a
deep
rich
festive
ale
d
yea
i
am
glad
i
bought
the
sixer
of
this
my
new
favorite
winter
warmer
and
i
will
buy
this
one
again
you
can
count
on
it
not
a
big
fan
of
the
spicy
gingerbread
cookie
like
flavors
1
12oz
was
enough
for
me
a
rare
miss
from
deschutes
for
me
when
i
say
miss
i
mean
not
the
typical
awesome
brew
from
this
brewery
still
okay
overall
pretty
good
winter
seasonal
not
my
favorite
beer
from
deschutes
but
still
very
good
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
overall
i
was
hoping
for
more
out
of
this
brew
like
some
of
the
other
beers
from
deschutes
i
felt
it
lacked
something
to
make
it
a
really
good
beer
it
definately
needed
a
bit
more
strength
in
the
taste
department
not
a
bad
beer
but
only
a
tad
above
average
plenty
of
other
better
seasonals
out
there
d
while
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
wouldnt
consider
it
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
though
poured
out
into
a
pint
glass
this
robust
reddish
brown
ale
started
with
a
low
foam
and
reduced
to
a
good
lacing
that
lingered
the
maltiness
tasted

taste
drinkability
a
nice
seasonal
beer
that
is
not
heavy
on
the
baking
spices
i
would
drink
it
again
what
seemed
promising
turned
into
a
bit
of
a
let
down
more
of
a
dark
pale
ale
than
a
winter
warmer
although
the
hops
are
a
nice
touch
but
thats
all
there
really
is
to
it
d
a
good
winter
warmer
for
the
reasons
listed
above
my
first
experience
with
jubelale
is
a
good
one
a
suitable
beer
for
the
season
mouthfeel
drinks
a
lot
like
wine
or
even
brandy
its
pretty
thick
and
heavy
not
a
beer
you
want
to
sit
and
drink
a
six
pack
of
but
should
be
enjoyed
one
at
a
time
winter
warmers
are
some
of
my
favorite
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
ive
had
of
the
style
ill
be
drinking
a
lot
of
this
one
this
holiday
season
drinkability
cant
get
enough
should
go
good
with
slow
cooked
red
meats
such
as
roasts
excellent
beer
for
fall
or
winter
warming
i
could
have
sworn
id
reviewed
this
one
before
but
i
guess
not
my
inlaws
actually
live
in
bend
so
i
am
lucky
to
get
a
sixer
of
this
every
christmas
god
bless
em
anyways
the
highlights
for
this
one
to
me
are
the
taste
and
smell
the
smell
is
a
nice
smokey
malt
mixed
with
a
hoppiness
i
would
also
say
a
bit
of
caramel
to
go
along
with
it
the
taste
has
a
little
more
pronounced
hop
to
it
but
its
quickly
balanced
out
by
the
strong
malts
all
in
all
a
great
beer
for
the
sweltering
cold
nights
in
charleston
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
ill
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
anchors
osa
but
i
still
look
forward
to
jubelale
every
year
cheers
overall
i
thought
this
one
was
very
well
done
a
good
classic
take
on
the
style
that
definitely
did
not
disappoint
i
would
have
no
problems
with
getting
a
good
dose
of
this
one
any
year
it
really
held
together
well
and
impressed
the
heck
out
of
me
solid
beer
all
around
this
brew
pours
up
an
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
nose
is
dark
malts
nice
malts
the
taste
is
kinda
sweet
also
dark
malts
in
the
mix
this
is
a
pretty
decent
holiday
ale
i
would
suck
this
one
down
again
the
palate
opens
with
a
wonderful
balance
between
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
a
firm
hop
bite
mostly
earthy
and
the
leather
notes
the
finish
is
just
out
of
this
world
the
balance
that
shines
on
the
palate
is
also
present
the
leather
and
brown
sugar
linger
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
beautifully
structured
arguably
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
had
drinkability
why
its
downright
tolerable
a
decent
standup
member
of
the
winter
warmer
league
d
not
too
sure
its
very
sessionable
bc
of
the
sweetness
but
a
good
way
to
start
or
end
the
night
in
any
event
a
nice
brew
at
a
nice
price
would
have
liked
to
have
had
in
the
winter
time
mouthfeel
would
be
thin
for
a
porter
but
this
is
a
winter
warmer

overall
i
doubt
ill
be
revisting
this
beer
in
the
near
future
but
if
it
was
the
only
cask
ale
present
i
wouldnt
be
too
shy
i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
carbonation
seems
to
be
among
the
first
things
to
go
i
had
a
good
finger
of
deeptan
head
until
it
gently
fell
leaving
behind
a
thin
layer
of
head
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
cola
highlights
and
i
could
not
decide
if
that
was
the
result
of
my
having
stirred
up
some
sediment
that
its
clarity
was
not
better
nose
was
very
caramelmalty
but
not
much
beyond
that
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
sweetsour
flavor
on
the
tongue
i
may
have
caught
this
one
just
in
time
it
was
still
caramelmalty
sweet
but
a
sharp
sourness
was
beginning
to
creep
in
finish
was
lingering
with
the
caramel
sweetness
so
perhaps
i
did
not
screw
it
up
as
badly
as
i
thought
winter
in
the
summer
whoda
thunk
it
had
a
dusty
vintage
bottle
at
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
pa
aside
from
the
dust
and
old
green
label
this
is
clearly
a
cellared
but
wellaged
beer
theres
no
strong
newspaper
or
cardboard
oxidation
thank
god
but
still
a
spicy
leathery
character
with
hints
of
sherry
there
were
also
pleasant
notes
of
lemon
and
berry
fruit
it
was
a
complex
beer
but
the
aged
character
was
a
bit
heavy
still
a
very
nice
experience
and
tasty
beer
verdict
again
it
could
be
the
aging
that
has
thrown
the
flavors
off
as
i
felt
the
beer
was
quite
stale
most
of
the
qualities
of
this
beer
seem
tarnished
and
off
not
hugely
enjoyable
but
im
going
to
try
a
more
recent
version
next
winter
to
see
if
i
cant
change
my
mind
pretty
average
for
what
its
worth
c
2
95
dhard
to
say
definitively
due
to
possible
infection
but
it
seemed
okay
wont
knock
your
socks
off
certainly
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
more
contemporary
takes
on
the
style
however
it
doesnt
do
anything
particularly
wrong
its
a
nice
malt
showcase
d
fairly
good
for
a
winter
warmer
goes
down
much
like
sa
winter
lager
a
nice
entry
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
complex
or
warming
enough
to
warrant
a
seasonal
rotation
spot
sessionable
and
worth
a
try
but
id
reach
for
something
with
more
character
or
abv
at
least
d
nothing
bad
but
nothing
extraordinary
either
so
could
have
a
couple
without
trouble
but
probably
wont
get
another
drinkability
not
sure
this
ones
meant
to
be
consumed
after
the
bestby
date
as
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
flavors
were
completely
muted
and
subdued
maybe
thats
just
the
beer
though
id
be
interested
in
trying
a
fresh
bottle
at
this
point
maybe
age
hurt
it
more
than
helped
it

with
a

that
sat

of
the
beer

whole

roasted

aromas
there
was
also
a
floral
hop
aroma
in
there
sweet
chocolate
nutty
flavor
that
gives
way
to
sweet
toasted
malts
nothing
is
too
overpowering
and
it
is
very
balanced
a
heavy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
sort
of
lingers
which
is
nice
the
taste
is
rich
full
malty
and
toasty
with
definite
caramellyfruity
sweetness
but
also
a
balancing
hoppy
leafy
bitterness
that
really
kicks
up
in
the
end
giving
it
a
nice
bite
its
rich
and
fullbodied
in
the
feel
this
is
delicious
and
very
satisfying
beer
a
decent
ale
but
as
many
others
have
noted
certainly
not
a
warmer
for
the
winter
time
also
not
the
best
of
offerings
from
youngs
id
stay
with
the
oatmeal

or

for
the
winter
even
better

you
can
still

i
have
to
say
that
i
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
i
have
like
youngs
beers
in
the
past
but
this
one
let
me
down
a
bit
this
beer
was
bit
overly
sweet
and
sticky
pours
a
somewhat
murky
brown
with
an
okay
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
smells
a
bit
earthy
with
some
light
cocoa
notes
and
a
bit
bready
as
well
there
is
a
slight
woodiness
to
the
aroma
and
a
characteristically
british
metallic
minerality
on
the
finish
taste
is
a
little
muddled
up
front
with
a
lot
more
earthiness
and
with
a
mineral
finish
the
breadiness
goes
away
refreshing
and
a
good
hit
of
dry
malt
that
lends
some
more
chocolate
not
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
pretty
decent
but
mothing
that
really
excites
me
overall
not
a
bad
tinnie
its
surprising
this
isnt
brewed
with
any
spices
its
got
lots
of
traditional
spiced
beer
flavors

i
hate
to
say
it
but
somewhat
disappointing
for
youngs
lacking
the
traditional
winter
warmer
character
looks
and
pours
like
an
old
ale
a
murky
brunette
with
a
shortlived
offwhite
head
aroma
of
nutmeg
caramel
and
dust
syrupy
mouthfeel
tasted
like
an
old
ale
as
well
lots
of
caramel
wood
and
metal
you
know
how
a
beer
just
keeps
going
downhill
as
you
drink
it
thats
this
beer
d
average
drinkability
for
a
winter
brew
nothing
that
really
stands
out
lacks
heart
d
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
spices
but
this
was
a
nice
surprise
very
mild
and
overall
a
nice
beer
d
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
was
easy
to
drink
though
500
ml
bottle
bought
at
college
liquors
in
grand
junction
co
pours
a
rubybrown
color
with
a
very
large
and
thick
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
very
light
toasted
malts
and
nutty
notes
the
flavor
is
very
nice
smooth
bursts
of
fruit
toasted
malts
light
nutty
flavors
and
a
rich
and
full
mouthfeel
very
nice
i
love
the
label
and
the
beer
easygoing
and
yet
very
flavorful
great
also
this
beer
is
a
few
years
old
best
by
september
2007
but
still
quite
good
ill
rerate
when
i
get
a
fresher
one
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
nothing
over
the
top
and
a
little
on
the
bland
side
though
there
are
much
worse
beers
to
be
had
d
an
ok
beer
maybe
more
of
a
dark
ale
than
a
winter
warmer
though
d
overall
this
is
an
okay
brew
that
i
would
reach
for
if
i
was
at
the
pub
in
england
on
a
late
fall
or
mild
winter
day
it
has
some
good
flavor
in
it
but
nothing
that
would
make
me
reach
for
it
outside
of
that
experience
quite
a
drinkable
brew
for
a
cooler
evening
it
goes
down
quite
easy
and
could
be
a
better
effort
for
most
australians
over
say
a
porter
or
a
stout
i
poured
a
nice
brown
hue
and
was
clear
with
off
white
foam
the
smell
and
taste
was
what
i
expected
it
was
sort
of
fruity
with
a
grainy
aftertaste
to
match
the
slight
bitterness
although
it
was
a
nice
mellow
ale
i
just
couldnt
rate
it
any
higher
because
the
taste
dissipated
and
was
gone
after
tasting
a
short
finish
i
feel
was
the
back
breaker
of
this
ale
the
flavor
is
equally
as
sweet
the
syrupymolasses
flavor
really
comes
through
but
with
the
slight
inflection
of
english
hops
the
result
is
a
very
enjoyable
ale
its
super
sweet
to
be
sure
and
it
may
not
necessarily
warm
you
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
malty
english
brews
this
one
is
for
you
on
the
positive
side
of
things
this
beer
is
mellow
and
smooth
despite
the
taste
not
adhering
to
the
style
of
a
winter
warmer
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
dark
copperybrown
pour
but
clear
with
a
creamy
beige
head
smell
is
slightly
tart
and
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
some
metal
decent
nose
for
the
style
taste
is
pretty
thin
metallic
and
slightly
sweet
and
tart
malt
with
a
metallic
finish
nothing
special
but
drinkable
all
in
all
not
too
enjoyable
and
another
average
to
below
average
beer
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
good
taste
and
pretty
smooth
worth
trying
sometime
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
smooth
and
drinkable
winter
warmer
yet
bold
enough
to
build
a
solid
character
an
excellent
brew
cheers
drinkability
very
pleasant
to
drink
light
on
alcohol
sure
but
its
full
of
flavor
ive
got
a
mind
to
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
d
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
crave
drinkability
too
malty
too
oily
not
for
me
expected
something
tasty
with
alot
of
spices
present
verdict
average
for
the
style
drinkable
but
i
believe
ive
had
better
this
is
the
second
time
that
i
have
drank
this
beer
and
surprised
that
it
did
not
get
reviewed
the
first
time
the
beer
opens
with
a
solid
brown
color
and
a
billowing
tan
head
that
rose
powerfully
to
the
top
of
the
imperial
english
pint
glass
the
beer
later
proved
to
show
great
head
retention
and
lacing
despite
its
deep
colalike
hue
aromas
a
sweet
malts
take
on
molassas
and
toffeelike
proportions
and
transfer
directly
to
the
flavors
undertones
of
chesnuts
cashews
and
berry
character
shows
more
so
in
the
flavors
that
the
scent
quite
estery
spicy
and
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmth
on
the
palate
the
feel
is
moderate
but
a
bit
disjointed
with
the
taste
i
cant
decide
if
i
want
the
body
to
be
heavier
to
support
the
sweetness
or
if
it
should
be
softer
allowing
easier
drinkability
finishes
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
pungent
perfumy
hops
to
counter
lingers
with
a
colalike
flavor
that
serves
as
a
bit
of
a
distraction
the
problems
that
i
have
with
this
beer
is
common
with
those
that
i
have
in
most
winter
warmers
the
style
is
obviously
not
my
favorite
mainly
because
it
tries
too
hard
to
be
everything
to
everyone
and
doesnt
pull
any
of
them
off
well
still
its
difficult
to
criticize
a
wellmade
beer
d
not
too
high
but
it
is
pretty
drinkable
in
fact
last
time
i
think
i
had
two
or
three
all
told
a
pretty
good
warmer
nothing
too
extravagant
but
worth
a
try
aroma
is
malty
with
some
caramel
brown
sugar
flavor
is
moderately
malty
some
caramel
light
molasses
dark
fruits
maybe
raisins
finish
is
pretty
dry
with
a
light
bitter
hop
note
coming
through
medium
body
lighttomoderate
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
somewhat
watery
doesnt
really
coat
as
the
label
suggests
abv
is
pretty
light
for
a
winter
warmer
so
not
much
of
a
warming
happening
with
this
one
plenty
of
better
options
out
there
this
was
the
worse
winter
warmer
i
have
ever
had
500
ml
glass
bottle
color
of
deep
amber
with
a
medium
tan
colored
head
nose
of
roasted
malts
slight
honey
and
mild
citrus
hops

taste
of
roasted
malts
slight
honey
some
toffee
and
mild
citrus
hops
body
is
light
and
clean
and
with
medium
low
carbonation

aftertaste
of
sweet
malts
dry
and
clean
pours
from
the
bottle
a
nice
dark
copper
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
not
a
much
hop
aroma
in
the
pour
or
as
the
beer
warms
as
with
other
brit
winter
warmer
i
have
tried
there
is
no
alcohol
warmthwhich
i
dont
expect
from
a
5
beer
toasty
finish
mouth
feel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
good
due
in
large
part
to
the
low
alcohol
and
hop
profile
all
in
al
a
drinkable
beer
but
for
the
winter
time
i
will
stick
with
american
winter
styles
d
definitely
drinkable
it
goes
down
easy
i
would
not
turn
a
second
one
down
that
said
this
is
not
at
the
top
of
the
line
for
young
co
i
expected
better
from
this
brewery
pours
with
a
dark
amber
hue
and
a
small
white
head
that
fades
after
a
few
minutes
aroma
is
fruity
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
toffee
taste
was
decent
a
good
bit
of
fruity
flavors
mostly
banana
and
a
very
light
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
very
light
on
the
palate
making
this
beer
quite
drinkable
and
sessionable
i
used
to
love
this
beer
years
ago
but
now
it
seems
boring
its
way
too
light
to
be
a
true
winter
warmer
maybe
my
palate
has
been
jaded
by
all
the
double
and
triple
whatever
beers
that
are
available
now
still
id
take
this
any
day
over
the
usual
macro
lagers
came
in
a
pint
glass
a
nice
heavy
brown
color
still
with
a
nice
bit
of
head
and
ended
up
with
some
good
lacing
decent
scent
a
nice
malty
hint
with
some
spices
good
taste
a
nice
strong
in
flavor
ale
with
excellent
holiday
spices
i
detected
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
went
down
great
too
very
smooth
worth
many
a
pint
this
winter
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
brown
wa
thick
tan
head
the
smell
was
a
bit
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
a
roasted
character
the
taste
is
that
of
a
brown
ale
with
a
malty
tone
and
a
roasted
malt
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
a
little
carbonation
my
overall
feel
of
this
beer
is
it
is
very
drinkable
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
load
i
really
wasnt
exactly
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
it
ended
up
being
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
just
one
but
as
soon
as
i
finished
this
one
i
quickly
wanted
another
isnt
that
the
mark
of
a
truly
good
brew
from
a
16
09
oz
bottle
with
a
black
cat
on
it
that
ran
me
2
99
this
dark
mysterious
looking
brew
poured
a
copper
darkorange
color
which
was
appropriate
for
its
status
as
winter
warmer
the
smell
was
pretty
good
with
a
nice
cocoa
stout
aroma
which
was
decent
without
being
too
powerful
the
taste
was
great
a
smooth
cocoa
latte
finish
which
could
have
used
a
few
more
spices
but
was
overall
a
nice
mix
without
being
overbearing
at
5
abv
i
thought
it
could
use
a
little
more
alcohol
to
be
more
appropriate
as
a
warmer
but
this
was
still
an
enjoyable
brew
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
a
great
drinkability
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
aroma
and
taste
were
not
overbearing
all
said
a
really
good
brew
that
is
definitely
recommended
overall
this
is
distinctly
not
a
winter
warmer
regardless
of
the
bottle
designation
brown
ale
maybe
but
not
a
ww
coming
from
youngs
this
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
this
is
the
first
youngs
beer
thats
disappointed
me
pours
a
clear
brownish
red
with
a
light
head
of
large
tan
bubbles
lightly
musty
aroma
slight
vegetal
hops
light
body
a
bit
surprising
light
burnt
malt
flavor
and
thats
about
it
very
drinkable
but
nothing
special
or
that
interesting
pours
a
clean
amber
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
armoas
of
a
small
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
sweet
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
a
small
bitter
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
butterscotch
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
not
much
in
the
nose
but
a
nice
flavor
with
a
small
bitterness
bought
at
a
local
liquor
store
kind
of
spur
of
the
moment
actually
went
there
for
something
else
beer
pours
with
a
nice
head
and
is
a
deep
brown
in
color
the
beer
is
quite
rich
and
complex
in
appearance
smell
is
fruity
but
definitely
not
citrusy
with
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
this
beer
has
a
subtle
texture
in
the
mouth
flavors
are
dark
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
definitely
has
some
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
coffee
and
choclate
and
this
is
by
no
means
an
overly
sweet
beer
another
delicious
offering
from
youngs
at
5
2
percent
alcohol
you
could
session
a
few
of
these
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
after
the
aroma
i
expected
something
sweet
and
fruity
this
actually
has
some
really
nice
maltiness
toasted
malts
dominate
it
is
nicely
carbonated
and
finishes
crisp
maybe
a
little
thin
if
i
was
to
nitpick
md
the
condition
of
fizziness
is
fitting
for
a
bottled
ale
quite
soft
while
the
body
holds
up
well
remaining
moderate
and
manageable
for
a
winter
warmer
or
a
premium
bitter
designed
for
winter
however
this
bottle
fails
to
impress
or
to
satisfy
my
palate
even
though
i
am
now
drinking
it
at
just
13
centigrade
in
sheffields
midsummer
i
only
hope
its
not
the
weather
that
makes
me
moan
the
cask
version
is
way
better
mind
you
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
having
in
the
past
drank
it
on
cask
pours
cloudy
medium
brown
with
minor
head
and
thin
sheen
of
lace
the
aroma
is
mellow
but
pleasing
mostly
nutty
with
suggestions
of
crusty
bread
brown
sugar
raisins
and
a
faint
touch
of
leafy
hop
the
beer
is
bigger
in
flavor
a
flash
of
metallic
water
at
the
start
gives
way
to
a
big
toast
and
brown
sugar
center
earthy
pineflavored
hops
provide
a
strong
and
long
lasting
dry
finish
the
fairly
thick
chewy
body
is
balanced
towards
creaminess
with
enough
carbonation
lingering
to
keep
things
interesting
the
hefty
body
makes
this
a
unhurried
drink
despite
the
low
alcohol
d
overall
this
is
a
plesant
and
very
drinkable
beer
however
in
my
opinion
it
is
too
mild
to
really
be
a
winter
warmer
at
5
2
it
just
doesnt
have
any
really
warming
properties
seems
like
it
would
have
been
more
accurate
to
call
it
a
bitter
of
some
sort
cheers2beers
d
one
of
these
is
not
bad
but
i
would
not
want
more
than
one
is
a
single
sitting
i
almost
wish
i
could
give
quarter
points
because
i
would
give
the
drinkability
a
3
25
on
this
brew
d
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
i
wasnt
a
great
fan
of
this
the
lack
of
flavour
could
allow
you
to
drink
it
in
a
session
but
would
become
very
boring
greasy
butter
aftertaste
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
either
pass
pours
out
a
dark
chestnut
kind
of
rusty
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
sides
causing
a
dip
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
leaves
thick
rings
of
intricate
lacing
smells
is
of
dark
toasted
malts
light
fruit
like
apple
and
pear
and
some
mild
herbal
hop
taste
is
malty
with
a
firm
bread
flavor
in
there
along
with
some
diacetyl
herbal
hopscaramel
and
roasted
flavors
mouthfeel
is
tame
in
the
carbonation
department
but
just
a
bit
thin
this
is
really
drinkable
and
is
quick
to
go
a
great
beer
when
it
is
bottled
better
ontap
and
splendid
on
cask
as
one
could
have
expected
im
not
sure
if
i
would
call
this
a
session
beer
i
really
liked
it
but
i
cant
see
myself
enjoying
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
it
has
a
wonderful
deep
copper
color
and
balanced
aroma
what
was
the
most
striking
about
this
ale
is
its
wonderful
bitternes
not
bitter
like
an
ipa
but
more
from
its
roastedness
its
a
well
rounded
brew
that
doesnt
hide
its
hops
or
its
malt
this
was
a
wonderful
find
from
which
i
will
seek
out
from
now
on
finally
had
this
gem
on
cask
as
i
was
again
in
london
just
recently
deep
clear
ruby
color
topped
by
an
airy
head
lacing
was
bubbly
and
scattered
in
nice
designs
mild
aroma
of
dark
fruits
and
roasted
malts
similar
palate
with
accent
on
ultra
smooth
and
drinkable
silky
mouthfeel
as
i
said
this
was
the
first
winter
warmer
i
had
on
cask
and
of
course
with
the
new
merger
it
was
brewed
in
the
wells
brewery
which
youngs
now
shares
wonder
how
much
better
the
ram
version
was
excellent
beer
somewhat
of
a
dissapointment
for
a
winter
warmer
was
hoping
for
much
more
d
perfect
i
dont
know
if
this
should
be
called
a
winter
warmer
though
i
think
is
is
more
refreshing
and
quenching
than
it
is
warming
low
alc
level
only
increases
drinkability
and
the
mixture
of
bready
malts
roasty
grains
and
high
doses
of
hops
combines
all
of
my
favorite
things
into
one
outstanding

i
do
like

that
may
be
partly
due

the
annual
anticipation
bottled
it
is
not

unlike

a

dryer
to
my
taste
from
the

it
is
a
smooth
worthy
pint
though
without
a
serious
head
and
only
light
aroma
its
the
taste
that
keeps
me
looking
for
it
every
year
mouth
not
at
all
warm
in
the
sense
one
expects
from
a
winter
warmer
some
light
bitterness
and
dry
at

then
dark

which
i
liked

too
gentle
and
lacks
commitment
to

carbonated
stimulation
all
the
way
through
easy
to
drink
almost
too
much
so
for
style
a
decent
brew
but
not
as
hefty
or
as
warming
as
it
should
be
for
a
winter
warmer
still
worth
trying

along

and

come
across
towards
the
end
a
decent
winter
warmer
brew
a
good
dececent
winter
brew
not
that
heavy
and
quite

drinkability
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
ale
which
holds
down
sessionability
for
me
good
flavor
but
not
much
warming
and
a
weird
overall
feel
a
low

winter


its
just
not

nope
it
however
makes
a
decent
english
brown
ale
its
not
bad
it
just
doesnt
live
up
to
its
potential
i
was
expecting
a
winter
warmer
with
some
of
that
double
chocolate
spirit
a
very
maltdriven
beer
to
be
sure
the
hops
are
there
but
there
is
a
waxy
quality
to
the
mouthfeel
that
coats
the
tongue
before
i
can
really
enjoy
them
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
im
failing
to
detect
some
of
the
spice
notes
i
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
if
i
were
judging
the
beer
on
its
own
the
score
would
be
higher
but
against
the
style
it
suffers
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
with
so
many
options
out
there
i
fail
to
see
any
value
in
trying
it
again
i
love
winter
warmers
most
all
of
them
but
not
this
one
drinks
okay
needs
more
malt
heft
barely
warms
at
all
compared
to
most
of
the
winter
warmers
out
now
this
is
lower
tier
imo
in

average
and
middle
of
the
pack
nice

a
thick

now
downhill
we
go
just
some

taste
was
flat
and
boring
nothing
to
describe
actually
a
little
harsh
and
unsavory
again
a
very
surprising

brew
its
fairly
drinkable

reach
for

lacks
the

taste
about

makes
it
a

beer
not

and
one
id
have
again
this
beer
is
so
much
better
live
and
oncask
in

that
it
is
hard
for
me
to
really
make
a

im
not

that
this
would
qualify
as
a
winter

in

book

i
will
defintely
be
drinking
more
of
it
little

or
no
this
ale
poured
a
clear
deep
chestnut
red
amber
with
tan
foam
which
was
thin
but
persistent
the
smell
was
slightly
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
tanginess
the
taste
was
malty
with
mildly
bitter
hops
there
were
faint
chocolate
and
caramel
nuances
very
slight
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
crisp
with
medium
thin
body
and
low
carbonation
and
a
lightly
lingering
flavor
this
was
a
very
nice
ale
with
a
somewhat
surprisingly
light
body
for
a
warmer
dark
caramel
color
with
some
red
highlights
were
the
light
sneaks
through
topped
with
a
big
fat
thick
beige
head
that
sits
on
top
of
the
glass
like
whipped
cream
and
leaves
thick
lacing
and
rings
around
the
glass
as
i
drink
aroma
is
low
and
malty
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
with
a
substantial
body
flavor
is
not
overly
spicey
but
has
hints
of
many
flavors
like
cinnamon
and
malt
and
caramel
and
fruit
that
morph
into
one
indescribable
flavor
very
enjoyable
beer
notes
like
many
british
ales
blissfully
flavorful
for
the
abv
there
are
tastier
winter
seasonals
to
be

this
is
certainly
well
worth
the
try
pours
a
copper

witha

malt
seems
to
dominate
the
aroma
throw
in
some

nobles
and
you
have
youngs

very
drinkable
very

i
like
this
beer
more
than
others
i
like
the
holiday
spice
flavor
that
doesnt
overpower
not
quite
up
there
with
other
winter
warmers
and
doesnt
stand
up
as
well
as
youngs
other
offerings
but
i
still
liked
it
drinkability
was
ok
but
the
flavor
was
just
a
bit
odd
the
name
winter
warmer
was
a
bit
deceiving
as
the
alcohol
was
just
average
i
love
youngs
stouts
so
i
was
just
a
bit
dissapointed
in
this
offering
a
murky
bronze
ale
with
a
small
and
fleeting
head
of
offwhite
bubbles
no
lace
to
speak
of
from
this
ale
the
nose
is
mostly
of
yeast
and
a
bit
grassy
the
flavor
is
malt
and
yeast
notes
and
the
feel
is
somewhat
peppery
and
moderately
full

a

with

and
a

amount
of

on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
fairly
week
with
just
a
little
maltiness
being
detectable
the
flavor
didnt
scream
winter
warmer
to
me
it
seemed
a
little
weak
and
didnt
have
any
kick
to
it
as
i
expected
that
it
should
have
it
was
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
to
drink
but
it
seems
to
be
lacking
that
little
bit
of
bite
that
i
think
something
called
a
winter
warmer
should
have
this
brew
poured
a
small
head
of
fine
to
medium
light
brown
bubbles
and
a
cloudy
brown
body
it
has
a
very
plesant
malt
spice
aroma
the
first
taste
showed
a
slightly
tingling
mouthfeel
and
a
flavor
of
spices
after
the
tingling
dies
down
a
nice
roasted
caramel
flavor
takes
over
they
blend
very
nicely
into
one
another
a
very
decent
brew
that
i
found
myself
continuously
sipping
on
when
this
brew
was
poured
into
my
glass
it
poured
with
a
small
tan
head
with
finemedium
bubbles
that
quickly
dissipated
the
lacing
was
sparse
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
body
was
brown
in
color
and
there
was
carbonation
observed
rising
to
the
top
it
had
a
fruity
aroma
and
a
smooth
and
buttery
taste
this
tanoxblood
winter
brew
is
topped
by
a
fast
fading
beige
head
with
sliding
lace
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
fresh

pears
sweet

almost

from

maybe
a

than
average
brief

presence
but
on
par
with
the
levels
of
malt
and
bubbles
one
of
the
more
wellbalanced
beers
ive
had
in
some
time
doesnt
appear
to
be
a
high
alcohol
brew
i
could
drink
it
all
night
and
be
a
very
happy
camper
but
i
think
i
was
hoping
to
be
able
to
drink
it
all
night
and
then
just
pass
out
just
kidding
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
a
nice
seasonal
to
indoctrinate
a
millcoorweiser
fan
sipping
beer
as
i
continue
through
the
pint
im
noticing
that
the
biscuit
flavour
grows
to
me
this
feels
like
a
nice
lunchtime
brew
and
a
decent
mild
brown
ale
refreshing
i
like
this
beer
though
i
definitely
dispute
the
winter
warmer
moniker
it
has
neither
the
alcoholic
warmth
or
the
rich
body
that
really
warms
me
up
this
was
the
sale
ale
at
the
saucer
so
maybe
it
was
just
old
there
were
three
of
us
who
ordered
it
tonight
i
got
mine
first
mine
had
no
head
it
had
no
aroma
it
had
no
real
taste
maybe
a
little
malt
but
that
was
after
much
discussion
with
the
other
two
folks
theres
were
much
like
mine
maybe
it
was
old
beer
it
was
barely
worth
the
2
50
we
paid
not
really
drinkable
bland
in
all
aspects
imports
of
the
same
price
are
of
a
much
higher
caliber
and
complexity
than
this
beer
maybe
if
youngs
winter
warmer
had
a
little
more
of
what
made
it
strange
and
a
little
less
water
it
could
be
quite
interesting
theres
a
little
dust
in
the
smell
along
with
grapes
some
toasty
grain
and
an
unidentifiable
sharp
sweetness
in
the
background
the
front
is
malty
but
light
the
middle
shows
toffee
and
molasses
but
im
a
little
disappointed
at
the
thinness
the
finish
is
english
dry
with
that
slight
sourness
overall
its
ok
but
it
doesnt
warm
me
much
this
wintry
week
poured
a
clear
deep
garnet
color
decent
head
with
clingy
lace
kind
of
tasted
a
little

with

flavor
i
tasted

sweetness
than
hops
in
this
one

mouthfeel
it
didnt
taste
bad
but
there
wasnt
anything
really

with
a

sweetness
certainly
more
hoppy
than
your
average
winter
warmer
but
quite
sweet
as
well
i
get
more
of
the
dried
mango
from
the
nose
along
with
apricots
tangerine
pine
needles
dried
currants
and
sultana
raisins
pancake
syrup
and
a
faint
nutty
note
although
maltier
than
many
of
the
aforementioned
pale
ale
family
this
is
still
a
straight
up
kissing
cousin
to
said
clan
the
finish
starts
sweet
but
dries
out
over
time
has
a
borderline
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
may
or
may
not
jive
with
the
aggressive
hop
bill
and
the
carbonation
is
at
the
low
end
of
moderate
enjoyable
if
a
tad
rough
around
the
edges
overall
slight
knock
because
this
is
not
a
winter
warmer
and
i
thought
it
was
when
purchasing
but
it
is
a
good
beer
o
nothing
like
a
winter
warmer
maybe
its
a
different
formula
this
year
no
spices
and
not
malty
hops
dominate
for
an
ipa
not
half
bad
not
a
bad
beer
i
must
say
the
alcohol
is
kind
of
front
and
center
but
i
guess
a
winter
warmer
is
supposed
to
be
warming
a
different
interpretation
on
the
style
and
i
quite
like
it
more
geared
toward
hops
than
brown
sugar
and
malt
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
after
hitting
the
slopes
for
some
backside
grunge
nose
grabs
not
an
ideal
warmer
so
no
props
for
the
style
still
delicious
and

this
is

to
leave
some

there
is
a

the
upfront
taste
is
dominated
by
a
cidery
alcohol
feel
that
is
not

not
terribly
tasty
either
the
finish
by
contrast
is
pleasantly
hoppy
hoppy

a
sour

that
has
both

a

more
than
a

of

sweetness
and
some
citrus
smooth
texture
has
about
average
fizz
and
body
overall
not
terrific
but
worthy
of
a
try
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
taste
does
not
flow
well
together
though
i
like
the
breadt
apa

profile
the
website
says
the
grain
bill
is
all
pale
and
honey
malt
hops
are
chinook
throughout
the
boil
and
chinook
to
dry
hop
this
is
a
dry
hopped
pale
ale
through
and
through
overall
not
sure
why
this
is
categorized
as
a
winter
warmer
its
very
much
an
ipa
in
flavor
profile
and
appearance
hops
are
plentiful
and
its

some

taste
is
of

with
a
very
spicy
herbal
and
pine
hop
finish
a
medium
level
of
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
categorize
it
as
it
stands
now
a
solid
ipa
for
sure
doesnt
hurt
that
the
beer
is
organic
either
o
this
was
pretty
good
a
little
hoppier
than
i
like
personally
but
definitely
one
of
the
better
winter
warmers
out
there
i
liked
the
anchor
one
better
overall
it
can
be
a
surprise
good
or
bad
sometimes
to
pick
up
a
beer
with
the
word
winter
as
part
of
the
title
that
isnt
a
spiced
ale
of
some
sort
listen
ive
got
a
beatup
nokia
phone
from
2003
no
interwebs
access
no
fancyschmancy
beer
apps
so
i
gotta
go
with
what
the
beer
bottle
tells
me
winter
on
the
label
can
usually
imply
a
maltforward
brew
or
something
potentially
packed
with
spices
the
only
ingredients
listed
were
water
orange
barley
and
hops
i
assume
yeast
was
utilized
as
well
at
some
point
at
any
rate
a
nice
brew
golden
straw

color
hazy
with
a

dissipated

quickly
aroma
of
mainly
citrus
and
pineapple
grapefruit
hops
dominate
the
flavor
but
theres
bready
malt
backbone
to
it
medium

with
an
effervescent
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
grapefruit
hops
linger
along
with
a

alcohol
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
this

very
drinkableif
you
can
deal
with
a
high
dosage
of
hops
the
body
was
much
thinner
that
is
expected
for
the
style
drinkability
was
decent
but
not
special
when
i
first
moved
to
the
area
11
years
ago
fish
quickly
became
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
maybe
its
my
palate
changing
but
it
seems
that
over
the
last
56
years
fishs
brews
arent
as
noteworthy
as
in
the
past
still
this
beer
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
not
what
i
was
expecting
given
the
usual
suspects
in
this
style
very
much
as
others
have
noted
like
a
doubleimperial
ipa
in
the
character
of
this
beer
after
getting
over
the
initial
surprise
i
have
to
say
id
have
it
again
d
once
i
learned
that
this
wasnt
your
typical
winter
warmer
i
was
able
to
better
appreciate
it
at
first
i
thought
they
got
the
production
lines
mixed
up
and
were
pouring
their
iipa
into
the
winterfish
bottles
if
youre
a

fan
this
beer
is
definitely
for
you
really

d
people
seem
to
keep
saying
good
things
about
this
brewery
but
i
havent
had
good
luck
with
them
thus
far
this
was
sort
of
a
weird
spiced
strong
pale
ale
more
than
anything
d
was
difficult
to
review
at
first
as
it
was
not
what

was

this

with

nothing
on

suggested
doing
otherwise
there
was
an

pseudocascade

i
backed
off

the

in

was

i
got
flavors

spices

a

finish
was
dry
as

rather
hot
even

to

what

o
this
isnt

if

like

although
no

is

in
the
taste
it
will
warm
you
up
a
bit
and
is
a
lot
easier
to
drink
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
k9
pours
a
darker
amber
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
really
wasnt
an
aroma
smells
like
air
the
taste
had
a
nice
sharp
malty
bite
with
a
good
amount
of
spices
good
feel
decent
flavors
overall
its
a
pretty
average
beer
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
special
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
nothing
too
exciting
and
it
becomes
redundant
quick
i
can
appreciate
this
but
its
not
something
id
try
again
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
winter
warmer
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
pretty
bland
and
it
wasnt
very
winter
warmer
like
with
such
a
low
amount
of
spices
it
was
more
similar
to
a
amber
ale
or
a
bock
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
a
little
rich
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
and
i
quickly
got
bored
with
it
so
one
is
enough
for
me
i
have
no
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
was
nice
and
it
was
the
aspect
with
the
least
amount
of
things
wrong
with
it
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
it
isnt
true
to
style
i
havent
had
a
winter
warmer
that
tasted
this
bland
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
not
very
hard
to
find
a
much
better
winter
warmer
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
any
of
my
friends
all
in
all
this
beer
just
wasnt
for
me
it
didnt
really
live
up
to
being
called
a
winter
warmer
this
one
is
up
there
as
one
of
me
least
favorite
flying
dog
beers
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
needs
some
major
work
overall
a
nice
beer
that
can
be
swigged
instead
of
just
sipped
by
the
fireside
embracing
the
taste
of
the
season
of
nutmeg
cardamom
date
fig
and
molasses
and
keeping
the
body
to
a
drinkable
level
overall
marzen
style
this
beer
gets
much
better
as
it
warms
too
much
soda
pop
and
booziness
sip
carefully
its
underrated
but
still
just
above
average
the
least
of
this
seasons
winter
warmers
for
me
with
widmer
brr
at
the
top
at
4
0
o
excellent
marzenstyle
winter
ale
again
big
with
the
booziness
even
a
little
overblown
for
a
warmer
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
might
be
a
hair
above
that
a
decent
bite
of
beer
per
sip
a
basic
and
unexciting
taste
that
is
out
of
character
for
flying
dog
as
their
beers
are
usually
always
interesting
and
worth
trying
this
one
started
pretty
slow
but
did
have
some
nice
caramel
malts
and
some
fruits
somewhere
around
the
middle
but
it
wasnt
enough
to
save
the
drink
im
afraid
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
with
a
strong
malt
character
would
be
an
awesome
beer
to
sip
by
a
roaring
fire
during
the
winter
not
sure
why
this
rates
so
low
of
a
score
it
is
better
than
that
overall
not
an
overwhelming
flavor
certainly
something
smooth
and
relaxing
for
a
cold
winter
night
wouldnt
mind
just
a
bit
more
spice
or
a
more
complex
malt
profile
poured
from
bottle
into
ommegang
tulip
pours
a
syrup
color
brown
with
moderate
head
good
hop
and
syrupy
booze
aromas
sweet
syrup
and
malt
flavor
with
minimal
spice
its
slightly
hopped
but
its
noticeable
overall
not
something
id
reach
for
all
the
time
but
a
good
sweet
malty
nicely
spiced
warmer
overall
this
does
not
work
for
me
and
i
will
not
seek
it
out
again
this
is
a
rather
simple
beer
it
is
prominently
caramel
in
flavor
with
very
faint
notes
otherwise
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
more
intense
than
it
should
be
there
isnt
much
here
to
separate
this
beer
from
any
other
winter
offering
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
once
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
mild
with
light
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
funky
aftertaste
that
is
on
the
dry
side
this
was
kind
of
blah
and
overall
on
the
dull
side
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
again
nor
would
i
buy
it
if
it
werent
in
the
mixed
12
pack
o
it
is
a
decent
tasting
beer
just
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
kinda
reminds
me
of
some
wet
hopped
beers
tastetoasted
malt
faint
cinnamon
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
in
this
brew
tastes
o
k
but
everything
is
kind
of
muted
and
laid
back
a
middleoftheroad
offering
from
a
brewery
that
has
a
lot
of
better
beers
to
offer
flying
dog
k9
winter
ale
3
55
overall
just
an
average
winter
warmer
that
uses
unhidden
abv
instead
of
a
nice
warming
finish
lazily
made
in
my
opinion
o
sts
2xmas
planted
a
seed
of
doubt
toward
my
general
dislike
of
winter
warmers
even
if
its
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
makes
me
remember
why
i
dont
really
care
for
the
typical
winter
warmer
it
feels
off
for
some
reason
o
drinkable
but
nothing
mind
blowing
moreys
bottom
line
its
not
as
bad
as
the
score
suggest
but
its
not
super
memorable
either
its
average
and
lost
in
a
sea
of
winter
warmers
and
christmas
ales
flying
dog
really
is
a
crazily
hotormiss
brewery
so
im
mostly
getting
an
aspirin
like
bitterness
from
this
beer
without
much
else
to
redeem
it
very
little
mouthfeel
very
little
flavor
just
all
around
disappointing
o
nothing
impresses
me
here
it
looks
nice
but
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
bland
or
relatively
onedimensional
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
herbal
hops
and
a
nutty
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
somewhat
high
herbal
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
with
an
astringently
bitter
flavor
that
is
somewhat
unpleasant
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
garnet
color
with
one
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
the
retention
was
ok
at
first
but
it
soon
was
little
more
than
a
needlethin
collar
that
left
only
a
few
small
spots
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
toffee
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
flavors
were
of
caramel
malt
toffee
diacetyl
nuts
toasted
malt
burnt
toast
and
then
a
finish
which
was
a
bit
to
herbalmedicinal
and
didnt
quite
balance
out
properly
distinctly
bitter
on
the
finish
but
it
wasnt
a
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
frothy
and
slick
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
a
bit
high
rather
average
overall
but
by
no
means
unpleasant
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
touch
of
malts
taste
is
also
on
the
mild
side
some
malts
lightly
hopped
kind
of
weak
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
overall
i
am
thinking
english
sort
of
slight
hoppy
strong
ale
here
not
so
much
a
winter
warmer
its
still
very
tasty
though
so
no
worries
there
oif
i
didnt
know
better
i
would
say
this
is
a
boozey
bmc
version
of
a
winter
warmer
except
the
only
bmc
winter
warmer
ive
had
winters
boubon
cask
ale
was
a
lot
better
than
this
its
just
harsh
i
tried
it
because
ive
been
seeing
it
everywhere
i
go
but
now
i
cant
understand
why
any
bar
would
want
this
o
flying
dogs
k9
cruiser
is
an
enjoyable
winter
beer
its
sweet
and
with
nice
seasonal
spices
a
solid
seasonal
offering
trying
the
flying
dog
k9
cruiser
this
cold
chicago
winters
night
the
beer
pours
clear
amber
with
thin
almost
nonexsistent
white
head
the
smell
is
mostly
caramel
type
malt
with
undertones
of
spice
the
taste
is
good
combo
of
spice
and
caramel
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
medium
body
with
so
so
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
winter
ale
o
a
very
worthy
offering
that
ill
look
forward
to
finding
next
holiday
season
as
well
this
brew
is
reminiscent
of
a
couple
christmas
ales
that
i
have
had
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
winter
beer
on
tap
at
winghearts
burger
joint
in
downtown
pittsburgh
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
cherrywood
red
color
with
a
dying
head
smells
fairly
basic
malty
and
seasonal
a
little
sharp
from
the
alcohol
flavor
is
slightly
spiced
malt
driven
and
subtly
hopped
its
very
dumbed
down
for
a
winter
warmer
nothing
over
the
top
which
makes
is
very
drinkable
i
suppose
overall
it
was
a
well
made
beer
but
fairly
unremarkable
in
terms
of
excitement
overall
a
strange
beer
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
i
like
it
might
not
buy
it
again
there
are
better
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
in
heat
wheat
etc
but
definitely
worth
a
try
i
thought
this
beer
was
very
good
most
reviews
dont
seem
to
agree
so
im
guessing
that
the
fact
that
my
beers
were
drawn
from
the
tap
makes
all
the
difference
overall
there
was
nothing
really
bad
about
the
beer
nothing
good
either
could
use
some
retention
and
attenuation
and
a
flavor
boost
o
well
not
much
of
a
winter
warmer
to
me
it
tastes
more
like
an
old
muddy
dipa
that
just
sat
around
to
long
i
didnt
like
the
unbalanced
flavor
profile
and
the
smell
was
very
basic
to
me
perhaps
i
got
an
old
one
but
i
dont
think
so
not
that
good
to
me
id
drink
it
again
but
not
buy
it
again
and
i
would
recommend
you
try
another
winter
warmer
before
this
one
o
eh
not
liking
this
too
much
flying
dog
always
tries
to
steer
clear
of
whats
expected
of
a
style
but
not
in
a
way
that
i
like
hmmm
ok
a
brown
winter
ale
with
a
strange
spicy
note
coriander
seems
like
an
odd
addition
to
a
winter
ale
if
thats
what
it
is
smelltaste
are
a
bit
uneventful
and
the
body
is
watery
its
alright
but
not
amazing
helps
to
confirm
my
opinion
that
american
brown
ales
are
not
a
style
i
like
that
much
o
this
wasnt
quite
a
drain
pour
but
it
was
definitely
a
meh
beer
with
a
capitol
m
overall
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
there
are
probably
a
handful
of
other
winter
warmers
i
would
grab
first
that
pretty
much
sums
up
how
i
feel
about
fd
as
a
whole
they
have
good
beers
but
there
are
so
many
other
beers
out
there
i
would
rather
drink
o
this
was
a
solid
winter
ale
really
smooth
and
went
down
way
too
easy
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
the
carbonation
almost
seems
to
be
missing
overall
not
too
impressed
had
much
better
winters
and
wont
be
going
back
to
this
one
again
another
beer
thats
getting
bad
ratings
for
god
knows
what
reason
malty
brew
dark
toast
comes
to
mind
minor
complexity
and
pretty
straight
forward
some
honey
and
more
sugary
sweetness
in
the
finish
nothing
special
but
a
decent
holiday
season
sipper
7
4
well
in
the
back
ground
would
just
fine
in
a
marinade
for
chicken
or
pork
or
as
part
of
a
sweet
reduced
sauce
oeh
not
too
special
1
5
t
a
couple
ounces
was
way
more
than
enough
of
this
but
i
drank
the
whole
bottle
anyway
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
who
the
hell
is
buying
this
such
that
they
havent
retired
it
this
beer
sucks
avoid
something
isnt
being
worked
in
this
beer
or
maybe
this
is
a
sign
that
i
really
need
to
visit
the
slopes
and
adopt
a
dog
o
this
beer
looks
fantastic
but
the
nose
and
taste
are
a
bit
off
and
then
theres
that
metallic
taste
and
feel
overall
i
would
call
it
a
tie
between
this
and
benedicts
winter
ale
otoo
bad
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
have
nice
flavors
to
go
along
with
it
this
is
just
an
average
beer
it
isnt
downright
awful
but
it
isnt
anything
exceptional
either
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
tight
offwhite
cap
some
mild
lace
the
aroma
is
of
earthy
hops
sweet
caramel
candi
sugar
spice
and
some
cherries
on
the
palate
toffee
and
candi
sugar
carry
through
the
middle
before
some
tart
cherry
spice
and
earthy
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
medium
body
adequate
carbonation
a
pretty
nondescript
beer
that
falls
around
average
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
a
light
lace
moderate
but
lively
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
toasty
nutty
malt
1st
sip
brings
a
reprise
of
the
aroma
toasty
nutty
malt
with
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
it
starts
off
sweet
but
quickly
becomes
dry
in
the
middle
with
a
very
dry
bitter
finish
consisting
of
slight
hop
note
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
solid
overall
a
pleasant
but
not
outstanding
winter
warmer
very
tame
maltiness
theres
a
good
touch
of
caramel
and
mild
sweetness
in
general
its
light
and
its
easy
interesting
smoothness
to
it
its
refreshing
but
its
kind
of
bland
nothing
there
that
jumps
out
but
its
an
easy
to
drink
ale
i
like
some
parts
and
am
indifferent
toward
other
o
im
a
little
disaapointed
i
was
expecting
it
to
big
one
way
or
another
its
tame
and
not
very
memorable
solid
not
must
have
never
the
less
it
is
a
refreshing
drinkable
beer
but
not
what
i
expect
of
a
winterwarmer
oalthough
it
tasted
alright
everything
else
about
this
beer
was
off
base
a
little
flat
and
not
much
there
in
the
nose
overall
it
was
pretty
good
again
a
bit
of
metallic
taste
but
i
thought
overall
it
was
a
decently
put
together
beer
o
all
in
all
a
good
winter
beer
a
bit
more
complexity
would
have
be
nice
but
i
enjoyed
this
effort
to
me
like
a
lighter
avery
old
jubilation
worth
a
single
bottle
pickup
for
sure
this
brew
is
reminiscent
of
the
wild
goose
snow
goose
seeing
how
flying
dog
use
to
brew
the
wild
goose
brand
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
this
is
virtually
the
same
exact
beer
regardless
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
winter
warmer
overall
very
mediocre
to
notverygood
beer
not
highly
recommended
and
barely
drinkable
the
body
is
more
or
less
the
balance
of
flavors
which
sometimes
tend
in
the
brewery
to
go
in
any
direction
but
we
feel
that
this
balance
is
right
and
it
is
undoubtedly
one
of
best
beers
of
the
brewery
easy
sipper
just
like
a
winter
warmer
should
be
i
guess
but
hardly
inducing
excitement
in
any
fashion
hops
kept
out
of
the
taste
smoothness
and
warmth
are
in
caramel
mild
spice
brown
sugar
offputting
bitterness
in
a
warmer
a
few
seconds
after
you
tell
yourself
its
smooth
huh
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
dark
red
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
head
fades
into
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
spiciness
to
it
and
some
malts
that
come
through
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
also
a
little
spicy
and
has
a
warming
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
semithick
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
pretty
nice
winter
warmer
id
like
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
my
tastes
have
changed
at
all
something
a
little
coarse
about
this
beer
there
are
so
many
great
christmas
and
winter
beers
this
is
one
of
the
less
interesting
still
quite
drinkable
for
a
switch
and
plenty
of
flavor

this
appears
a
clear
brownish
red
under
a
thin
but
well
sustained
head
aroma
is
that
of
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
deep
note
of
chocolate
licorice
and
crisp
floral
hops
deep
toasted
malt
dominates
the
palate
here
for
the
most
part
with
a
well
suited
carbonation
that
lets
the
flavor
dominate
notes
of
sweet
dark
cocoa
and
toasted
nut
come
through
to
me
and
theres
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
throughout
that
restrains
the
malt
feel
to
a
favorable
level
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
boozy
winter
warmers
ive
ever
tried
but
as
the
brew
nears
closer
to
room
temperature
from
the
fridge
climate
the
alcohol
feel
truly
does
seem
to
subside
and
a
nice
caramel
note
begins
to
break
through
on
the
palate
just
like
most
flying
dog
beers
this
is
nothing
special
i
recommend
it
as
an
entry
level
winter
ale
for
those
that
havent
embraced
strong
flavors
pours
copperbronze
color
and
has
a
fairly
thick
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
smells
of
deeply
roasted
sweet
malts
with
some
caramellike
malted
scents
tasting
it
i
pick
up
some
chocolate
flavors
that
compliment
some
of
the
roastysweetness
fairly
nicely
and
some
very
faint
hops
add
bitterness
and
keep
the
alcohol
from
entering
in
too
strongly
from
the
equation
you
dont
really
taste
the
alcohol
but
you
do
notice
its
warmth
and
it
bites
a
bit
along
with
the
light
hops
it
makes
an
impact
on
your
mouth
and
id
be
wrong
to
call
this
brew
smooth
its
forceful
which
sort
of
makes
it
hard
to
appreciate
the
texture
of
this
one
overall
it
makes
for
an
okay
winter
ale
but
misses
out
on
some
of
the
fun
wintery
things
that
one
tends
to
look
for
in
the
style
considering
winter
is
about
to
be
completely
gone
soon
id
better
get
rid
of
these
winter
brews
ive
got
left
hanging
around
this
one
pours
a
clear
amberruby
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
orange
peel
mandarin
oranges
and
lightlybuttered
biscuits
the
taste
brings
out
the
bitterest
notes
possible
from
these
elements
ranging
from
the
white
part
of
the
orange
peel
to
an
astringently
charred
biscuit
honestly
this
comes
off
as
just
too
much
bitterness
in
a
bad
way
for
anything
good
to
really
come
of
it
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dry
finish
overall
not
my
cup
o
tea
so
to
speak
thanks
to
all
that
crappiness
on
the
tongue
poured
amber
with
a
huge
creamy
head
that
quickly
faded
leaving
some
nice
lace
down
the
sides
smell
was
hoppy
with
sweet
caramel
undertones
and
a
slight
smell
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
extremely
sweet
almost
tasted
like
candy
dry
hopped
finish
but
still
very
sweet
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
really
drinkable
d
not
awful
its
just
much
more
of
a
pedestrian
winter
warmer
thats
high
in
abv
but
not
offering
anything
pronounced
i
wish
the
aromas
caramel
malt
sweetness
would
have
carried
into
the
flavor
for
better
taste
and
balance
d
a
winter
warmer
for
those
who
enjoy
a
bitter
finish
on
their
beer
i
would
have
liked
to
see
more
attention
given
to
the
malt
side
of
the
profile
since
theyre
definitely
in
there
and
are
tasted
at
the
beginning
of
the
quaf
as
well
as
exploding
from
the
bottle
on
the
pour

spices

not
the

but
definitely
in
the
category
pours
with

slight

funky
yeast
and
little
else
you
either
like
this
particular
smell
or
hate
it
taste
is
malty
not
many
dominant
flavors
a
non
sugary
date
flavor
with
a
warm
to
hot
spicy
finish
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
to
my
palate
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
warm
drinkability
is
good
for
me
very
warming
winter
brew
i
like
this
yeast
nothing
particularly
special
a
good
winter
warmer
although
the
mouthfeel
brings
it
down
a
bit
in
the
drinkability
category
beer
is
pretty
bitter
from
hops
the
lead
off
is
a
mild
sweetness
but
the
beer
finishes
really
thin
and
very
bitter
there
is
a
hint
of
some
spice
in
the
midpalate
something
light
like
allspice
its
very
subtle
its
very
bitter
pretty
shocked
by
that
overall
especially
for
flying
dog
its
a
decent
beer
id
even
caution
a
second
bottle
notes
the
bartender
said
this
was
an
esb
i
see
other
reviews
here
treat
it
as
a
strong
ale
it
seemed
a
bit
dark
and
sweet
to
me
for
an
esb
but
reviewed
as
a
winter
warmer
makes
better
sense
even
if
it
is
lacking
in
spices
it
was
nicely
balanced
however
between
malt
and
hops
just
like
a
good
esb
should
be
so
call
this
a
hybrid
winter
ale
and
go
with
it
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
this
out
but
after
having
tried
it
i
would
not
hesitate
one
bit
if
i
had
the
opportunity
to
order
a
bottle
of
it
or
get
it
on
tap
somewhere
d
an
uneven
beer
where
the
aftertaste
is
the
best
part
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
not
my
favorite
seasonal
but
it
wasnt
altogether
too
bad
wish
it
could
have
had
a
bitter
better
balance
the
bitterness
is
too
strong
and
too
sharp
for
me
i
drank
about
half
of
this
beer
before
pouring
it
down
the
drain
thats
a
big
deal
for
me
because
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
a
drain
pour
maybe
i
was
just
having
a
bad
day
but
i
would
never
recommend
this
anyone
d
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
lots
of
flavor
and
spice
nice
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
lots
of
fruit
and
spice
notes
with
a
nice
dose
of
bitterness
very
dry
winter
warmer
very
unexpected
lots
of

is
contributing

with
cramel
sweet

a

the
whole

leaving
behind
a

your

style
of
christmas
ale
mouthfeel

easy
going
carbonation
glides
across
the

defintitely
doesnt
cloy
or
make
the
experience
sour
a
smooth

go
to
christmas
ale
that
i
will
revisit
in
the
future
d
the
dry
bitter
finish
isnt
something
i
look
for
in
a
winter
warmer
like
i
said
im
not
familiar
with
this
style
of
beer
d
this
is
a
good
overall
winter
warmer
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
would
get
a
six
pack
of
this
it
is
a
nice
and
drinkable
brew
but
a
bit
thin
overall
and
would
consider
other
winter
brews
d
not
a
bad
beer
with
no
hint
of
the
7
abv
as
stated
on
bottle
074a11
it
just
didnt
interest
my
palette
at
all
wasnt
big

malty
enough
to
be
a

good
tasting
beer
with
a
definite
sweetness
caramel
and
even
chocolate
i
get
a
slight
bit
of
the
alcohol
burn
that
is
trademark
winter
warmer
mouth
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
that
is
a
little
too
noticeable
a
great
beer
to
pair
not
a
great
beer
to
drink
alone
in
my
opinion
a
really
enjoyable
and
hoppy
winter
warmer
not
surprisingly
malt
is
also
the
prominent
trait
in
the
taste
buttery
caramel
notes
are
also
there
along
with
a
slight
bit
of
toasted
grain
a
subtle
pinelike
hop
presence
appears
at
the
end
to
add
a
bit
of
dryness
as
the
head
might
have
suggested
there
is
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
the
creaminess
is
probably
one
of
the
best
traits
about
this
beer
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
decent
enjoyable
beer
however
the
dry
finish
adds
some
redundancy
to
the
experience
a
little
gross
compared
to
the
other
beers
of
the
evening
which
didnt
really
stand
out
aside
from
the
jolly
roger
thin
skimping
on
malts
overattenuative
yeast
probably
not
the
latter
flavors
would
still
present
themselves
appears
dark
amber
brown
little
or
no
head
smells
of
malt
and
light
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
too
light
or
heavy
tastes
of
malt
with
a
crisp
hoppy
finish
a
little
too
bitter
at
the
end
decent
malty
winter
beer
but
loses
a
lot
of
flavor
to
the
hops
bitterness
a
decent
winter
beer
it
seems
flying
dog
likes
to
use
multitudes
of
wheat
and
malt
with
their
beers
considering
this
is
what
most
of
them
taste
like
this
beer
is
warming
me
up
as
it
warms
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
in
the
mouth
with
some
alcohol
burn
sippability
is
high
o
good
drinkability
a
bit
sweet
but
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
drinkability
enjoyable
to
drink
has
something
to
offer
for
everyone
and
appropriate
for
the
season
o
over
all
a
decent
winter
beer
d
well
flying
dog
seems
to
create
some
great
beers
but
this
one
really
offered
nothing
to
come
back
to
if
i
wanted
an
old
ale
i
would
stick
to
founders
or
even
some
great
lakes
a
nice
winter
ale
though
drinkability
my
first
thought
was
this
was
a
fine
english
strong
ale
and
i
wondered
why
it
has
a
relatively
meddling
average
then
that
astringent
aftertaste
began
to
gnaw
at
me
ultimately
there
are
much
better
english
strong
ales
out
there
such
as
odell
isolation
deschutes
jubelale
avery
old
jubilation
and
full
sail
wassail
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
d
i
like
flying
dog
beers
in
general
for
all
purpose
drinking
but
this
is
my
least
favorite
kaynine
pours
out
your
standard
bronze
type
color
with
some
pumpkin
orange
to
round
it
out
get
a
not
so
tight
loose
root
beer
type
head
that
stays
and
goes
just
as
fast
a
semi
cap
afterwards
with
some
spots
atround
the
glass
this
really
smells
like
a
beefed
up
marzen
mixed
with
some
amber
base
as
well
malty
caramel
grainy
rich
sweet
blech
taste
is
what
i
expected
a
sweet
oktoberfestmarzen
some
werthers
qualities
some
spice
in
the
finish
but
not
enough
to
call
this
a
ww
some
butterscotch
caramel
alot
of
grizanne
and
toasted
malt
feel
is
medium
above
and
elixer
like
a
small
carbing
faint
alcohol
afterwards
well
it
looks
like
its
back
to
the
drawing
board
for
a
new
ww
to
scope
out
this
one
does
not
cut
the
mustard
a
underwhelming
big
winter
ale
that
needs
more
spice
and
pizazzz
poured
into
a
snifter
color
is
an
amberred
with
a
tad
bit
of
white
head
and
a
little
bit
of

the
nose
is
cherries
caramel
malt
sweet
bread
and
some
light
yeast
the
taste
is
mainly
some
moderatelysweet
malt
medium
feel
with
some
sweetness
drinkability
is
alright
not
the
typical
winter
warmer
but
not
too
much
involved
either
mouthfeel
overly
carbonated
d
doesnt
taste
the
best
i
could
drink
a
few
but
it
wouldnt
be
the
most
enjoyable
experience
nice
full
bodied
beer
it
leaves
you
slightly
dry
but
not
uncomfortably
its
fairly
drinkable
if
you
like
the
style
i
might
follow
through
and
get
a
6
pack
but
prob
only
one
this
winter
d
this
definitely
was
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
lately
its
a
nice
take
on
what
a
winter
ale
should
be
im
not
sure
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
with
the
unique
taste
and
fairly
high
alcohol
content
for
its
genre
good
to
enjoy
with
those
who
are
into
different
beer
not
for
those
who
like
consistency
of
taste
perhaps
the
driest
winter
warmer
weve
had
this
season
not
a
bad
thing
but
certainly
different
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
regardless
this
is
a
pretty
inviting
brew
with
winter
knockin
on
the
door
d
the
medicinal
taste
and
smell
that
i
picked
up
on
is
enough
to
make
sure
i
steer
clear
of
this
one
in
the
future
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
fuller
than
i
thought
they
might
be
too
its
got
some
better
than
expected
characteristics
and
some
that
are
merely
ok
reasonable
but
not
a
favorite
beer
not
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
in
fact
not
very
good
at
all
would
not
try
again
this
beer
has
cause
be
to
have
an
aversion
to
flying
dog
beers
d
sort
of
a
weird
brew
and
not
really
in
a
good
way
the
6
4
abv
would
suggest
this
is
a
strong
ale
but
its
almost
like
they
went
for
a
winter
warm
but
missed
the
mark
and
wound
up
with
an
unbalanced
ipa
the
malts
and
not
nearly
as
sweet
or
rich
as
expected
and
the
hops
seem
misused
and
deter
from
drinkability
along
with
the
clear
alcohol
flavor
sort
of
a
black
eye
for
flying
dog
imo
a
decent
winter
ale
goes
down
relatively
smooth
but
its
nothing
to
brag
about
to
a
friend
cheers
overall
i
didnt
think
this
was
a
winter
warmer
but
i
cant
penalize
it
for
that
its
labelled
as
a
winter
ale
which
in
my
opinion
is
undefined
see
bells
winter
white
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
hoppy
esb
worth
a
shot
a
clear
ruby
brown
color
pour
with
a
small
light
tan
head
quickly
fading
to
a
ring
leaving
some
nice
lacing
medium
carbonation
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
slightly
spicy
with
some
breayd
notes
flavor
is
malty
and
spicy
with
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
medium
bitterness
light
body
for
the
style
slick
mouthfeel
this
is
very
drinkable
way
more
aroma
than
flavor
but
still
a
good
brew
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
rather
typical
but
with
an
undertone
of
spice
it
pours
a
nice
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
offwhite
head
flavor
is
more
hoppy
than
malty
decent
but
seems
to
lack
the
spice
i
picked
up
in
the
aroma
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
a
little
fizzy
not
flying
dogs
best
but
still
a
good
party
beer
a
light
copper
pour
head
is
big
and
bubbly
whenever
i
see
loosely
packed
bubbles
like
this
i
am
cautious
not
too
impressive
looking
has
a
funky
adjunct
aroma
that
i
can
only
link
to
leinenkugels
beers
i
smell
alcohol
and
hops
no
malt
presence
in
this
warmer
bit
of
an
upset
flavor
is
all
over
the
place
not
sure
what
fd
was
going
for
here
a
big
hit
of
booze
right
up
front
next
is
hops
and
finally
a
very
faint
spice
flavor
almost
has
an
effect
of
eating
dry
nutmeg
and
then
taking
a
shot
of
cheap
whiskey
my
experiences
with
flying
dog
have
been
very
good
prior
to
this
very
disappointing
tastes
like
leinenkugels
beers
just
cheap
and
fake
thin
and
fizzy
so
much
for
mouthfeel
feel
like
i
downgraded
after
tasting
so
many
good
beers
first
time
i
ever
saw
it
on
the
shelves
and
usually
fd
delivers
good
beers
yowzas
d
not
really
my
thing
im
usually
a
big
fan
of
flying
dog
but
this
tastes
a
lot
like
what
youd
find
in
a
keg
at
a
party
when
you
arent
totally
sure
whats
in
the
keg
very
nice
effort
from
fd
this
beer
pours
average
a
bit
carmel
in
color
and
the
aroma
does
not
set
you
up
for
the
disapointment
to
follow
heavy
maltiness
with
earthen
tastes
make
it
seem
stronger
than
it
is
kind
of
beats
you
up
a
bit
going
down
and
a
strong
bitter
after
taste
lingers
on
the
tongue
not
a
real
great
interpretation
of
the
style
d
not
a
terrible
brew
but
average
at
best
seems
to
really
struggle
in
relation
to
style
guidlines
seems
to
be
in
a
muddled
territory
between
esb
and
very
weak
pale
ale
wouldnt
recommend
and
may
actually
turn
down
if
offered
another
dont
pour
too
aggressively
or
foam
might
fill
half
the
glass
otherwise
its
a
good
23
fingers
high
of
delicate
bubbles
and
foam
starts
to
dimple
across
the
surface
not
much
lacing
but
very
good
retention
crystal
clear
brown
to
red
brick
or
dirt
color
more
of
a
metallic
orange
at
the
rims
despite
clarity
few
bubbles
visible
reticent
nose
offers
meager
portions
of
toffee
malts
orange
infused
chocolate
and
then
some
hop
spice
maybe
some
leafiness
like
lettuce
or
cabbage
light
to
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
swirls
through
the
attack
and
momentarily
distracts
from
the
lack
of
flavor
ginger
spice
dried
cocoa
malts
and
orangelemon
citrus
try
to
dance
with
peat
moss
pepper
straw
and
a
nondescript
bitter
edge
maybe
pear
or
apple
fruit
consistent
qualitywise
with
most
products
of
this
brewery
kind
of
generic
overall
im
not
sure
that
i
get
it
thats
just
life
dance
through
it
all
d
this
is
good
stuff
and
a
case
would
be
more
than
welcome
not
really
what
i
expected
going
in
but
the
overall
hoppiness
of
the
brew
is
welcome
in
my
opinion
ill
pass
on
this
one
you
should
too
well
the
bottle
bills
this
thing
as
malty
pretty
far
from
a
maltforward
beer
its
more
similar
to
an
apa
than
anything
else
but
with
a
boosted
abv
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
this
does
not
say
winter
to
me
why
go
to
all
the
trouble
of
brewing
a
seasonal
and
turn
out
such
a
mundane
ale
probably
my
least
favorite
flying
dog
beer
yet
which
is
saying
quite
a
bit
a
drinkable
winter
warmer
without
a
whole
lot
of
frills
or
complexity
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
that
really
seems
like
a
basic
apa
rather
than
a
winter
warmer
good
for
what
it
is
but
nothing
special
not
a
bad
beer
from
flying
dog
just
needed
more
flavor
character
i
would
buy
it
again
but
it
definetly
isnt
even
close
to
a
lot
of
other
excellent
winter
seasonals
out
there
definately
one
of
the
better
malt
forward
wwsnot
the
best
but
definately
worth
a
try
this
season
quite
sessionable
real
average
brew
that
earns
the
ultimate
average
grade
in
all
categories
this
brew
is
not
bad
by
any
means
just
could
be
alot
better
drinkability
eh
cant
say
i
was
real
into
it
the
hops
didnt
add
so
much
as
flatten
everything
much
better
winter
warmers
out
there
avery
old
jubilation
is
a
very
similar
beer
in
flavor
but
much
better
in
my
opinion
d
not
an
easy
beer
to
drink
while
i
didnt
hate
it
i
did
get
tired
of
it
about
34
of
the
way
through
the
beer
drinkability
after
previous
reviews
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
horrible
although
i
actually
enjoyed
it
i
love
that
this
beer
has
a
decent
hop
profile
since
its
nice
to
have
a
good
bitter
hop
profile
in
the
cold
weather
not
only
that
but
the
balance
with
the
malt
is
perfect
in
my
opinion
just
enough
to
keep
me
interested
i
like
flying
dogs
effort
and
as
this
is
not
the
best
winter
warmer
out
there
its
a
notably
good
one
pick
this
up
if
you
see
it
drinkability
too
many
distractions
going
on
here
to
make
this
one
a
keeper
the
beer
pours
an
amber
copper
color
with
pretty
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
beer
doesnt
look
all
that
bad
on
the
nose
i
get
almost
nothing
i
kept
on
going
back
to
this
beer
and
well
nearly
nothing
there
is
some
light
spice
and
bit
of
sweetness
but
otherwise
thats
it
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
no
better
there
is
some
very
light
underlying
sweet
malt
with
some
spice
and
theres
some
hoppiness
in
the
finish
but
this
beer
really
doesnt
have
much
flavor
it
has
a
fairly
dry
finish
and
has
a
pretty
light
mouthfeel
drinkability
would
probably
be
ok
except
theres
really
very
little
enjoyable
about
this
beer
really
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
this
brew
isnt
going
to
make
you
take
notice
in
its
bold
flavor
by
any
means
but
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
it
is
very
drinkable
a
brew
that
goes
down
very
easy
and
comes
in
at
over
6
alcohol
is
pretty
good
and
a
welcome
thing
in
the
cold
nights
of
the
winter
season
hey
if
you
are
sitting
in
the
house
and
want
to
tie
one
on
this
will
do
the
trick
and
tastes
decent
good
brew
that
will
not
offend
anyone
d
too
watery
for
my
taste
nice
to
try
once
overall
too
watery
and
too
flat
in
taste
too
low
in

average

notes

this
beer

wasnt

that
let

down
well
i

solid

with
big

would
like
to
have
seen

a

fits

devour

as
well
with
a

that
leaves
a
great
glyceryl
note
behind
not
sure
why
i
didnt
try
this
beer
before
but
im
happy
i
finally
did
for
the
first
beer
from
flying
dog
that
ive
tried
this
is
a
good
beginning
i
wouldnt
mind
another
of
these
this
beer
wasnt
bad
not
a
big
fan
of
the
winter
warmer
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
poured
a
copper
color
with
very
little
off
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
taste
was
good
it
was
mostly
malty
roasted
flavors
with
a
nice
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
12oz
brown
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
the
color
of
tarnished
copper
with
virtually
no
head
to
speak
of
citrusy
hops
and
toffeecaramel
like
malt
citrusy
hops
with
a
fair
bit
of
diacetyl
and
some
toffee
flavor
too
with
hints
of
spice
on
the
aftertaste
no
alcohol
flavor
but
definitely
some
alcohol
warming
going
on
here
somewhat
slick
mediumbodied
with
full
carbonation
definitely
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
by
any
means
decent
enough
but
not
something
id
really
seek
out
again
this
is
a
strange
brew
for
sure
taste
like
a
big
brown
ale
with
spices
it
would
be
decent
if
it
wasnt
for
the
bitteralcohol
like
flavor
overall
good
winter
offering
but
not
my
favorite
very
rich
and
sweet
but
really
not
bad
they
went
with
the
sweet
style
of
winter
brews
where
i
jprefer
the
strong
and
spicy
i
appreciate
the
difference
and
will
go
back
to
it
again
next
year
for
a
good
sitting
by
the
fire
beer
i
only
hope
the
flying
dog
bws
in
the
cellar
are
better
than
this
brew
pours
nicely
clear
brown
that
is
ruby
hued
when
held
to
light
good
sized
crème
head
minimal
action
on
the
nose
flavor
is
decent
starts
off
mellow
and
a
high
sweet
tone
kicks
quickly
on
the
end
before
vanishing
smooth
but
not
a
lot
of
character
going
on
here
really
feel
is
smooth
as
well
with
the
liquid
and
carbonation
giving
it
good
overall
this
is
a
nice
drinker
nothing
really
interesting
or
eventful
though
had
this
ontap
at
the
rumba
cafe
poured
in
a
pint
glass
with
about
two
fingers
of
head
great
retention
lots
of
lacing
deep
ruby
color
smells
and
tastes
are
pretty
simple
nice
malt
backbone
with
some
warm
spices
medium
body
very
drinkable
nice
example
of
a
winter
warmer
but
not
the
most
dynamic
one
ive
ever
tasted
still
it
fit
the
purpose
and
i
enjoyed
it
seems
pretty
average
to
me
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
seeking
out
imho
thanks
to
gxxerman
for
the
sample
my
second
beer
ive
sampled
from
the
flamboyant
flying
dog
brewery
i
must
say
i
definitely
liked
their
rendition
of
a
winter
warmer
better
than
their
pale
ale
which
was
also
good
but
lacked
the
flavor
and
flair
of
this
great
sample
a
really
nice
warmer
with
a
nice
6
4
alcohol
percentage
which
provided
a
nice
glow
appearance
was
good
a
nice
prunishreddish
brown
with
little
carbonation
but
a
nice
color
smell
was
sweet
with
caramel
and
sugars
present
taste
was
really
pleasing
with
a
vanilla
and
cinnamon
flavor
present
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
drinkability
was
great
went
down
smooth
and
the
alcohol
was
hard
to
detect
behind
a
sweet
cinnamonvanilla
flavor
that
was
really
pleasing
a
good
example
of
the
style
recommended
note
i
beleive
flying
dog
now
brews
in
maryland
which
will
make
it
more
accessible
for
us
in
the
east
woof
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
the
greatest
winter
warmer
either
worth
trying
each
year
perhaps
but
im
not
sure
id
get
more
than
a
bottle
each
time
i
can
think
of
many
winter
seasonals
to
drink
before
i
even
think
of
this
beer
a
disappointing
warmer
from
a
rather
reliable
brewery
i
suggest
cruising
past
this
one
to
another
option
final
note
most
of
flying
dogs
base
brews
have
been
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
to
me
with
the
exception
being
in
heat
wheat
i
love
their
extreme
beers
namely
double
dog
and
gonzo
imperial
porter
but
im
not
a
real
big
fan
of
the
regular
brews
d
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
all
i
need
now
is
a
fire
some
snow
a
warm
hat
and
mittens
and
maybe
some
marshmallows
to
roast
this
is
a
sipping
beer
not
necessarily
one
youd
drink
a
whole
6pack
in
a
night
not
bad
but
hardly
terrific
id
weakly
recommend
this
beer
i
bought
this
bottle
at
3
cellars
in
franklin
wi
a
lot
of
winter
ales
have
a
taste
that
seems
to
linger
and
die
and
finally
rot
on
top
of
my
tongue
this
one
is
a
clear
exception
the
stunning
steadman
bottle
pours
neatly
in
the
glass
with
a
slight
white
head
and
translucent
ruby
red
color
the
first
sip
is
smooth
and
filling
the
taste
deteriotes
only
slightly
as
the
glass
slowly
empties
a
good
winter
choice
pours
a
pale
copper
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
sweet
maltiness
in
the
taste
a
sweet
maltiness
and
just
a
hint
of
christmas
spices
nutmegcinnamon
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
small
malty
yet
very
clean
aftertaste
not
huge
in
flavor
but
easy
drinking
for
a
strong
ale
pours
a
clear
rubyorange
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
has
pretty
good
staying
power
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
notes
of
citrus
and
spice
along
with
some
dark
fruit
mediumbodied
with
earthy
malt
spice
and
fruit
flavors
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
with
a
sweet
malt
aftertaste
even
though
it
is
one
of
flying
dogs
better
offerings
that
isnt
saying
a
whole
lot
resists
the
urge
to
get
thick
and
yet
retains
the
right
level
of
heaviness
for
this
type
of
brew
huh
still
havent
had
anything
from
this
brewery
that
impressed
me
maybe
they
should
ask
ralph
steadman
to
brew
the
beer
drinkability
winter
has
never
looked
bleaker
drinkable
no
i
cant
sorry
this
one
pours
a
full
three
finger
head
that
retains
well
over
a
deep
redish
brown
brew
it
seems
to
be
well
carbonated
as
the
head
refuses
to
die
and
the
carbonation
continues
to
rise
within
the
glass
this
one
smells
a
little
too
boozy
for
only
7
48
but
theres
malty
sweetness
almost
bready
behind
the
alcohol
with
floral
hops
to
balance
things
out
i
give
it
some
time
to
settle
and
warm
before
my
first
sip
that
ellicits
a
caramel
malty
sweetness
that
gives
way
to
a
hop
bite
well
balanced
and
less
alcohol
here
than
in
the
nose
the
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
gives
it
a
creamy
consistency
fairly
drinkable
even
in
the
summer
but
i
did
expect
more
wintry
spices
given
the
labeling
of
winter
ale
on
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
on
the
palate
especially
once
its
warmed
a
bit
moderate
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
bit
like
a
mix
between
a
scottish
wee
heavy
and
a
doppelbock
recommended
d
overall
not
a
really
great
beer
but
not
really
a
bad
one
spices
are
all
right
and
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
a
great
example
of
the
style
anchors
christmas
ale
is
way
better
i
find
it
very
enjoyable
although
id
like
to
linger
on
the
flavor
a
bit
longer
instead
of
the
hops
finally
a
flying
dog
beer
i
wasnt
disappointed
in
is
this
beer
as
good
as
other
winter
style
ales
out
there
no
is
it
a
bad
beer
not
in
my
opinion
worth
trying
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
bunch
for
flying
dog
wow
i
wonder
if
that
abv
is
correct
7
48
hooooweee
i
would
definately
try
this
one
again
cool
theres
one
more
left
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
gets
the
feeling
that
this
could
have
been
better
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
a
very
good
winter
warmer
and
dessert
beer
a
solid
ale
little
disappointing
hop
profile
but
otherwise
pretty
damn
drinkable
seems
to
be
more
of
a
brown
ale
in
many
respects
its
essentially
a
heftier
brown
ale
drinks
well
with
a
considerable
hop
character
its
dry
with
enough
sweetness
to
balance
but
the
hops
keep
things
firmly
coralled

and
an
american

citrusgrapefruit
flavor
is
slight

noticeable
balanced
flavor
with
a
respectable

ample

give
some
texture
to
the
mouthfeel
filling
in

making
the

full
lighter
carbonation
allows
the
minimal
residual
sugars
and
slightly
tannic

to
settle
in

the

dries
the

finishes
mildly
roasty
with
a
faint

bitterness
hic
fruit

the

might
be
fanatastic
if
it
were
toned
up
a
little
dark
brown
with
crimson
highlights
and
a
tight
tan
head
with
good
retention
dark
fruit
and
boozy
esters
are
all
im
getting
from
the
nose
with
the
first
sip
a
nutty
malt
character
is
noted
and
followed
by
dark
roasted
notes
and
a
nice
balance
of
dry
bitter
hops
that
are
spicy
at
times
a
little
yeasty
tartness
a
little
sweet
and
some
caramel
notes
too
a
noticeable
alcohol
presence
is
a
tad
too
much
for
me
and
considering
the
abv
for
its
style
is
on
the
low
end
some
of
the
alcohol
retreats
as
it
warms
allowing
its
other
characters
to
come
to
the
forefront
medium
mouthfeel
and
some
creaminess
at
the
end
is
pretty
nice
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
nice
head
with
some
spotty
lacing
down
the
frame
smells
of
sherry
and
some
slight
toffee
tastes
really
nice
with
a
few
malty
aromas
and
possibly
cherries
nice
hoppy
kickback
at
the
end
makes
you
yearn
for
the
next
one
i
think
this
should
be
offered
year
round
and
i
will
buy
this
when
it
is
available
thick
malty
and
syrupy
backbone
a
tad
creamy
with
toffee
caramel
highlights
and
a
mini
hop
snap
on
the
finish
i
like
this
beer
it
reminds
me
a
scottish
ale
very
drinkable
at
6
4
abv
and
quite
appropriate
on
this
late
december
evening
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
was
tasty
and
really
didnt
offend
wouldnt
be
dissapointed
if
i
saw
this
on
tap
d
pretty
tasty
not
sure
why
this
beer
is
getting
such
low
ratings
yes
the
flavor
is
a
little
flat
compared
to
the
aroma
and
ive
had
many
better
strongwinter
ales
but
this
one
is
ok
this
one
is
less
than
stellar
its
got
some
basic
flavour
to
it
and
thats
about
it
its
simple
and
easy
drinking
but
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
and
would
likely
only
sample
again
if
there
were
no
better
choices
on
the
menu
or
in
the
store
another
brew
from
the
recently
pruchased
pick
your
own
six
it
was
a
good
looking
deep
amber
with
brownish
tint
and
minimal
head
at
the
pour
smell
was
faint
but
i
detected
some
malts
and
maybe
butter
taste
was
decent
maybe
a
bit
of
raisins
and
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
just
a
decent
beer
the
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
well
rounded
brew
mk
pours
a
very
nice
copper
thin
head
not
much
retention
but
good
lacing
smell
was
on
the
weak
side
malts
and
dark
fruits
mostlty
body
is
medium
not
much
carbionation
taste
is
sweetand
fruited
has
a
nice
rasin
flavor
edge
a
hint
of
spice
throughout
make
this
a
very
nice
beer
anyway
interesting
the
beer
has
certain
heft
to
it
up
front
perhaps
not
as
much
as
i
could
wish
for
in
a
winter
ale
but
enough
to
stave
off
a
light
chill
fairly
drinkable
at
least
it
is
light
enough
for
that
and
it
only
coats
the
mouth
lightly
as
it
passes
down
my
gullet
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
a
certain
creaminess
comes
to
the
body
of
this
beer
sweet
richly
caramelized
malt
notes
lean
towards
fruity
notes
of
raisins
and
even
a
touch
of
cherry
but
both
fruits
have
been
lightly
burnt
and
concentrated
under
a
nice
hot
broiler
a
touch
of
roasted
grain
character
leaves
a
light
burnt
note
that
lingers
on
in
the
throat
after
the
sip
yet
still
the
concentrated
sweet
malt
notes
dominate
the
long
finish
this
certainly
has
some
hop
components
to
the
flavor
profile
as
well
notes
of
sweet
tinged
herbs
intermingle
with
a
light
citrus
character
and
a
lingering
bitterness
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
some
reason
it
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
smaller
version
of
deschutes
jubelale
which
seems
to
strike
the
winter
warmer
profile
a
bit
better
than
this
beer
does
dark
brown
cola
in
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
nose
is
maltdominated
with
a
nut
brown
tanginess
and
a
hint
of
hop
crispness
definitely
tangy
on
the
tongue
even
a
bit
tartsour
right
away
but
theres
some
rich
dark
malt
way
out
in
left
field
keeping
the
whole
act
together
this
is
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
a
bigger
beer
is
it
really
7
4
in
fact
ive
enjoyed
k9
cruiser
on
several
occasions
in
the
past
but
never
realized
it
was
this
strong
in
that
sense
and
maybe
given
the
fact
that
i
poured
this
at
fridge
temperature
it
seems
thin
for
the
style
but
it
doesnt
exhibit
any
lack
of
the
character
id
expect
from
a
robust
winter
seasonal
apart
from
this
perceived
thinness
really
takes
on
another
character
as
it
warms
up
revealing
that
rich
malt
character
i
mentioned
earlier
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
in
the
past
and
this
time
with
some
curried
rice
the
beers
residual
sweetness
complemented
the
spiceheat
of
the
curry
quite
well
gotta
add
a
couple
of
last
observations
great
balance
here
between
hops
and
malt
its
subtle
here
but
far
from
uninspired
and
the
k9
recipe
has
maintained
a
commendable
degree
of
consistency
in
a
climate
favoring
hopbombs
and
imperial
renditions
of
every
style
kudos
to
flying
dog
on
that
a
brown
blood
yet
clear
ale
hue
greats
my
eyes
along
with
a
a
sprse
head
with
no
retention
or
foam
with
this
beer
the
aroma
amkes
up
for
the
look
of
this
beer
great
malts
presence
brinbgs
out
lots
of
dark
fruits
and
hintys
of
cocoa
the
taste
is
like
a
bunch
of
malty
prunes
with
a
dash
of
ovaltene
very
smooth
for
such
a
fruity
tasting
ale
very
sessionable
if
teh
abv
wasnt
so
high
d
a
nice
crisp
winter
ale
one
of
the
more
drinkable
flying
dog
offerings
poured
to
a
brownish
re
with
medium
offwhite
head
that
dissiopated
fairly
quickly
to
a
little
lacing
initial
aroma
was
dark
fruit
mostly
plums
and
raisins
flavor
at
first
was
more
of
the
malty
dark
fruit
as
bottle
warmed
the
alcohol
though
only
6
2
became
more
evident
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
this
beer
was
a
little
like
a
braleywine
but
not
quite
there
this
was
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
flying
dog
mgreat
taste
md
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
softlyfizzy
quite
healthy
but
lacking
a
depth
that
is
desirable
for
the
slightly
thinish
body
not
bad
overall
its
just
that
the
filtering
process
may
have
killed
off
the
goodies
of
the
original
brew
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
this
up
if
i
see
it
in
a
sixer
at
my
local
store
now
dont
get
me
wrong
im
a
big
fan
of
flying
dog
liking
their
ipa
wheat
amber
and
barleywine
styles
however
the
sourness
of
this
beer
really
ruined
the
experience
but
this
doesnt
mean
that
i
will
not
try
k9
cruiser
again
ill
definitely
give
it
a
shot
if
i
find
it
available
on
tap
if
it
happens
to
appear
in
another
mixed
pack
ill
be
sure
to
drink
it
first
just
in
case
this
turns
out
to
be
a
beer
that
doesnt
age
well
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
brownreddish
color
a
slight
head
forms
with
little
or
no
retention
and
disappated
quickly
strong
malt
aromas
very
sweet
dominate
every
scent
the
malt
is
also
the
most
distinct
flavor
then
about
halfway
across
the
palate
some
hops
kick
in
for
some
bitterness
in
the
mouth
it
comes
across
thin
at
first
then
at
some
point
it
begins
to
get
some
weight
to
it
that
lasts
till
the
end
you
can
also
feel
the
alchol
at
the
end
of
each
taste
this
is
a
good
beer
for
febuary
not
for
june
the
sweet
malt
and
high
alchol
make
it
a
solid
beer
for
those
winter
months
pours
dark
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
smell
is
fruity
sweet
malts
caramel
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
begins
with
fruity
notes
and
sweet
malt
that
are
followed
by
the
hops
to
balance
this
brew
out
i
think
this
beer
does
a
good
job
of
hiding
its
high
alcohol
content
overall
a
better
beer
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
still
was
not
overly
impressive
a
tasty
ale
however
it
lacks
the
spice
i
look
for
in
a
winter
offering
just
the
right
level
abv
a
taste
with
hints
of
caramel
no
real
bitterness
theres
an
aftertaste
thats
subtle
and
fruity
i
wanna
say
raisons
its
only
after
several
mouthfulls
that
i
begin
to
sense
some
carbonation
and
alcohol
but
not
strong
the
other
flavors
pick
up
too
its
easy
to
drink
i
would
want
to
have
more
of
these
but
id
probably
end
up
on
the
floor
cheers
is
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
overall
kind
of
bland
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more

there
is
pretty
good
though
i
really
have
no
idea
what
flying

was
trying
to
do
here
drinkabililty
sourmetallic
aftertaste
along
with
very
parching
effect
compromise
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
why
i
suppose
its
a
good
way
to
get
booze
into
the
system
but
it
doesnt
taste
good
at
all
if
this
were
cheaper
college
kids
would
love
to
slam
it
ill
be
staying
away
from
this
one
in
the
future
blech
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
kind
of
disappointing
for
a
highish
gravity
beer
furthermore
it
seems
to
be
damn
near
flat
the
result
is
a
very
watery
beer
juice
but
it
is
actually
quite
an
enjoyable
product
despite
the
weak
body
surely
doesnt
seem
like
a

fond

so
i
was

that
i
didnt
take
to
this

all
that
much
it
seemed
a
bit
of
a
muddle
with

there

not
really

a

its
still
a
decent

dont

just
not

gave

created
was
more
than
i
expected
but
it
finally
calmed
down
to
soft
pillow
of
foam
the
beer
itself
is
a
hazed
brownish
orange
with
very
fine
bubbles
of
carbonation
flavor
is
settled
and
plain
with
a
sweet
malty
base
and
touch
of
spice
that
sticks
out
enough
to
make
for
a
decent
holidays
ale
this
one
poured
out
as
a
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
on
the
spicy
side
but
nothing
too
crazy
really
the
taste
of
the
beer
didnt
really
give
off
the
vanilla
i
was
hoping
for
like
it
said
on
the
label
the
herbs
and
spices
took
over
most
of
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
a
little
on
the
heavier
side
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
but
i
felt
a
little
disappointed
by
it
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
somewhat
indulgent
winter
warmer
their
bottle
caps
really
cry
out
to
be
gently
popped
off
since
they
can
definitely
be
reused
by
artistic
types
upon
completion
of
this
arduous
task
foam
began
to
rise
up
through
the
neck
of
the
bottle
prompting
me
to
begin
the
gentlest
of
pours
so
as
not
to
rouse
the
lees
at
the
bottom
this
of
course
created
only
wisps
for
head
so
i
employed
the
servers
trick
and
got
a
finger
of
french
vanillacolored
head
which
fizzed
out
pretty
quickly
color
was
deep
amberlight
copper

srm
13
all
in
all
fantastic
winter
beer
one
of
the
first
ive
had
from
hitachino
the
white
ale
was
pretty
great
but
its
a
bankbreaker
and
piques
my
interest
to
try
more
the
bottle
opened
with
a
loud
hiss
so
i
was
a
bit
concerned
with
oxidization
but
it
is
pleasantly
only
faint
medium
bodied
which
is
on
the
fuller
end
with
soft
carbonation
up
front
and
a
very
heavy
spice
character
lots
of
pepper
coriander
clove
cinnamon
ginger
and
nutmeg
immediately
which
is
slowly
countered
by
a
silky
caramel
malt
presence
and
a
good
bit
of
dark
fruit
hints
of
toffee
hazelnut
dark
cherry
plum
fig
and
other
berries
ive
had
this
fresh
and
it
has
definitely
mellowed
out
with
six
years
age
the
abv
is
very
well
masked
with
only
some
slight
alcohol
sweetness
but
no
heat
or
warmth
in
the
finish
resulting
in
a
complex
quaffable
beer
the
intense
spice
character
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
this
beer
has
aged
nicely
wow
completely
textbook
perfect
with
an
edge
of
something
nice
and
delectably
warm
carbonated
malty
and
spiced
pour
is
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
very
ample
head
about
3
fingers
nose
of
orangepeel
clove
and
coriander
some
burnt
and
toasty
and
a
nice
thick
blanket
of
esters
and
toasty
malt
the
palate
gave
way
to
something
fantastic
of
a
blend
of
all
those
qualities
nice
and
toasted
sesame
seeds
clove
rich
candied
orangepeel
and
a
backbone
of
bitohoney
and
chocolate
it
tastes
like
liquid
fruit
cake
every
aspect
of
a
winter
warmer
spot
on
not
sure
what
they
are
going
for
here
but
the
body
is
very
muddy
muddled
and
murky
doesnt
really
look
appealing
at
all
but
this
is
a
first
for
me
so
i
will
still
give
it
an
average
smell
is
full
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
a
twist
of
orange
reminds
me
of
thanksgiving
dinner
with
a
dash
of
christmas
now
i
am
getting
a
good
eggnog
vibe
good
job
on
this
part
the
citrus
really
comes
thru
in
the
front
doesnt
smooth
out
much
but
the
spices
come
thru
in
dashes
in
the
end
and
mellows
out
into
a
mostly
nutmeg
taste
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
mellow
although
tasty
not
something
i
can
picture
drinking
a
lot
of
good
stuff
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
trying
lakewood
holiday
spice
lager
if
you
like
this
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
the
flavors
and
character
are
very
complex
and
different
from
most
of
the
style
and
are
extremely
varied
creamy
body
and
carbonation
although
higher
carbonation
would
do
well
to
cut
the
bitterness
overall
a
decent
beer
but
disappointing
i
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
because
it
may
not
have
been
aged
properly
i
only
bought
it
6
months
ago
so
ill
keep
my
eye
out
for
more
poured
hazy
orange
color
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
with
fair
lacing
moderate
spice
and
fruit
aroma
light
to
medium
body
with
a
slick
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
spicy
sweet
flavor
with
a
medium
spice
finish
of
moderated
duration
refreshing
complex
beer
it
tastes
as
it
smells
i
dont
usually
enjoy
darker
beers
but
this
was
fantastic
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
and
i
think
it
is
a
good
step
into
the
darker
beers
like
most
reviewers
this
beer
gushed
out
and
made
a
glass
of
foam
that
took
forever
to
calm
down
this
is
a
very
carbonated
beer
that
tasted
much
lighter
than
the
abv
suggests
i
felt
that
was
tasting
a
saison
with
added
spices
which
is
pretty
different
for
a
winter
warmer
i
liked
the
flavours
though
a
little
less
carbonation
would
have
helped
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
im
not
so
keen
on
the
gushing
but
this
more
than
makes
up
for
it
in
the
complex
flavor
real
warmth
a
medium
creamy
body
carbonation
is
fairly
forward
this
is
a
winter
beer
that
drinks
well
in
the
summer
mouthfeel
was
medium
full
this
was
easily
drinkable
as
a
sipper
overall
too
sweet
for
my
liking
this
guy
was
a
bit
of
a
gusher
pours
an
opaque
deep
mahogany
with
a
decent
head
smells
a
bit
sour
initially
with
some
raisins
and
ginger
lots
of
yeasty
notes
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
but
not
overbearing
the
overall
combination
of
spices
gives
this
beer
a
weird
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
good
carbonation
and
thickness
11
2
ounce
bottle
expensive
at
over
4
oh
no
this
is
real
expensive
when
it
turns
out
to
be
a
gusher
upon
opening
my
immediate
thought
was
expensive
drain
pour
but
after
the
gush
the
huge
head
and
the
excess
foaming
this
one
settled
down
to
a
murky
very
dark
brown
under
a
dark
tan
mottled
head
that
left
blobs
of
thick
lacing
a
load
of
pungent
nutmegcinnamon
in
the
nose
more
heavy
spicing
on
the
tongue
as
well
as
plenty
of
carameltoffee
and
rich
velvety
smooth
thick
wintery
goodness
interesting
stuff
too
expensive
to
go
to
often
but
worth
a
large
splurge
to
see
what
is
going
on
here
actually
aside
from
the
carbonation
this
was
a
pleasnat
beer
and
definitely
different
than
any
other
asian
product
ive
had
a
good
mouthfeel
on
this
one
the
spices
linger
on
the
tastebuds
a
while
after
each
sip
high
marks
for
drinkability
as
well
could
definitely
go
for
multiple
in
one
sitting
poured
a
deep
cloudy
amber
color
ale
with
a
nice
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
is
well
balance
with
the
sweet
caramel
malt
profile
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
deep
caramel
malt
with
loads
of
spices
which
may
includes
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
body
is
full
and
beer
is
very
rich
with
no
apparent
alcohol
and
some
good
carbonation
i
very
much
enjoy
this
one
even
though
it
is
quite
filling
and
wouldnt
drink
more
then
one
at
a
time
i
ma
starting
to
really
enjoy
beer
from
this
brewery
and
looking
forward
to
more
discovery
d
just
too
much
going
on
it
is
a
love
it
hate
it
brew
at
first
taste
i
liked
it
but
as
i
consumed
more
it
became
undrinkable
it
is
just
a
little
too
overthetop
full
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
just
right
on
the
cabonation
a
bit
spicy
to
drink
more
than
one
but
easy
to
sip
very
good
gives
any
winter
warmer
a
run
for
the
money
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
poured
a
slightly
hazy
orange
brown
with
a
tightknit
head
that
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
sweet
bready
aromas
up
front
followed
by
some
bright
fruit
and
spicebox
aromas
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
beetween
spice
mixed
fruit
including
plums
and
pears
breadiness
cardomom
pepper
cinammon
and
clove
i
like
this
a
bit
better
on
draft
probably
because
the
creaminess
is
accentuated
and
the
spices
become
less
bitter
delicious
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
great
to
find
this
on
tap
i
always
appreciate
this
brewerys
products
d
the
9
is
hidden
fairly
well
but
it
is
a
strong
beer
so
i
think
i
would
limit
myself
to
one
out
of
respect
for
my
fellow
man
my
bottle
was
overcarbonated
maybe
shaken
in
the
case
on
the
way
home
so
it
took
a
while
to
pour
and
drink
but
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
my
first
beer
from
kiuchi
brewery
and
i
gotta
say
i
really
liked
it
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
nice
barleywine
or
old
ale
i
love
this
beer
for
its
sheer
weirdness
and
depth
of
character
bizarre
and
delicious
this
may
be
the
best
thing
out
of
the
gate
for
the
kiuchi
crowd
in
the
words
of
a
certain
famous
japanese
tv
personality
its
a
total
success
pours
with
an
out
of
control
head
taking
about
30
mins
from
opening
the
bottle
until
i
got
a
proper
sip
in
after
the
wait
the
appearance
is
a
nice
blood
red
with
some
hazy
brown
mixed
in
the
smell
is
rather
begian
with
spices
and
dark
fruits
the
flavor
is
complex
starting
with
some
bready
yeast
and
going
into
some
cinnamon
orange
and
darker
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
big
as
i
would
expect
even
though
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
over
the
top
as
for
drinkability
i
can
feel
some
of
the
heat
from
9
but
it
is
mostly
warming
and
pleasant
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
i
will
have
to
try
other
from
kiuchi
2007
version
after
a
bit
of
gushing
upon
popping
the
cap
the
beer
itself
possesses
a
massive
head
that
fades
to
a
thick
centimeter
beer
covering
the
body
is
cloudy
and
russet
colored
with
tinges
of
mahogany
its
very
pretty
the
nose
is
vibrant
with
spices
orange
peel
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
are
most
prominent
there
are
some
hints
of
vanilla
as
well
but
little
in
the
way
of
malt
or
hops
on
the
palate
sharp
citrus
notes
from
the
orange
peel
come
in
first
off
then
the
vanilla
comes
through
with
a
vengeance
the
other
spices
play
more
of
a
supporting
role
along
with
the
subdued
sweet
malts
and
backgroundonly
bittering
hops
in
spite
of
the
gushing
the
beer
is
nicely
albeit
substantially
carbonated
overall
this
is
an
excellent
winter
warmer
and
one
that
i
will
most
likely
seek
out
in
future
years
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
i
look
forward
on
trying
more
from
this
brewery

flavors

this
was
real
good
and
gave
plenty
of
beers
from
belgium
a
serious
run
for
their
money
prost
a
ridiculously
spicy
desserty
beer
but
superbly
balanced
and
without
the
thickness
many
similar
beers
might
bring
with
it
bright
and
lively
not
anything
near
an
everydaybeer
considering
its
bold
spices
and
high
abv
but
if
you
want
a
quality
walk
on
the
spiced
side
there
arent
many
better
choices
than
this
this
is
a
very
interesting
styledefying
brew
absolutely
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
the
beer
pours

somewhat
hazy

has

breweries
beers
different
maybe
generally
worth
a
sample
pours
a

color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
and
good
lace
it
smells
of
cherry
and
nutmeg
spicey
lemon
and
vanilla
very
complex
and
interesting
the
flavor
is
a
bit
strong
with
heavy
alcohol
like
brandy
i
pick
up
more
nutmeg
with
citrus
bitterness
and
a
sweet
cherryorange
base
thick
bodied
and
strong
not
real
drinkable
for
me
but
very
interesting
this
brewery
intrigues
me
so
far
so
i
will
explore
further
but
i
wont
drink
a
lot
of
this
one
a
taste
treat
in
small
quantities
on
occasion
d
easy
enough
to
drink
although
there
is
a
higher
abv
its
hidden
well
but
i
dont
reccomend
making
a
session
out
of
this
one
would
buy
this
again
to
share
with
those
who
would
appreciate
it
but
not
for
something
to
be
enjoyed
regularly
d
a
tasty
spiced
ale
very
well
layered
and
nice
vanilla
addition
the
bottle
conditioning
kept
it
fresh
and
flavorful
it
gets
a
bit
intense
as
it
gets
to
room
temperature
i
would
definitely
pick
up
another
bottle
to
try
this
winter
edit
as
the
drink
warms
up
i
smelt
and
tasted
more
of
the
orange
peel
the
vanilla
was
almost
overpowered
w
the
orange
but
its
still
there
luckily
the
spice
stays
w
the
drink
even
as
it
warms
up

interesting

that
are
hard

pin
down
very

black

maybe
some

hard

mysterious

all
the
way
some
vanilla
and
spice
in
the
background
alcohol
fairly
well
hidden
great
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
is
just
not
to
my
liking
drinkablity
is
fine
so
far
my
least
favorite
offering
from
this
brewery
overall
pretty
good
nothing
too
amazing
this
brew
could
use
a
bit
of
reworking
it
is
overpriced
for
what
you
get
still
probably
one
of
my
favorite
labels
of
all
time
cheers
sadly
the
odd
hop
taste
blows
all
the
other
flavours
in
this
beer
out
of
the
glass
it
tastes
like
the
japanese
brewers
attempted
to
reproduce
a
dark
trippel
and
a
good
one
but
then
botched
it
on
the
hops
or
possibly
even
accidentally
mixed
in
some
lactobacills
would
try
another
vintage
though
perhaps
it
needs
more
time
in
the
bottle
or
the
coming
years
will
see
refinement
flavor
is
nice
enough
though
the
balance
is
greater
than
my
own
attempts
at
a
celebration
style
ale
malt
palette
is
a
bit
toastier
and
darker
than
others
ive
had
hoppy
bitterness
is
mellowed
too
perhaps
due
to
3
years
in
a
bottle
i
dont
love
the
celebration
style
and
i
think
it
has
turned
a
little
body
is
medium
slick
and
velvet
smooth
mouthffeel
is
a
bit
dull
due
to
the
fine
carbonation
but
this
is
a
very
tastey
and
unique
brew
a
completely
different
take
on
a
winter
warmer
d
one
is
enough
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
when
it
hits
it
does
so
with
a
vengence
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
would
expect
nothing
less
from
hitachino
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
beer
looks
and
smells
pretty
great
but
the
flavor
just
doesnt
deliver
hitachino
is
definitely
a
hit
or
miss
brewery
in
my
opinion
and
this
is
no
exception
there
are
much
better
spiced
winter
warmers
out
there
and
considering
that
this
one
was
lackluster
and
almost
4
for
12oz
i
think
ill
be
sticking
to
those
others
personally
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
although
i
probably
will
try
next
years
vintage
perhaps
this
one
just
needs
some
serious
cellar
time
my
first
impression
of
this
beer
was
how
spicy
it
was
it
was
hard
to
describe
or
pinpoint
the
flavor
was
bright
floral
and
almost
soapy
i
would
describe
this
as
tart
rather
than
bitter
and
the
tartness
balanced
the
delicious
sweetness
very
well
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
this
to
it

unique
so

it

the

are
okay
ont
his
one
its
interesting
im
just
not
sure
its
something
i
would
revisit
often
but
since
its
a
holiday
seasonal
maybe
its
supposed
to
be
a
one

something
worth
a
try
regardless

overall
this
beer
was
rather
good
albeit
very
unique
for
the
style
it
looked
smelled
and
tasted
like
a
belgian
tripel
yet
was
somehow
labeled
as
a
winter
warmer
the
taste
is
crisp
complex
and
at
times
reminds
me
of
a
sort
of
tart
unsweetened

notes
took
the
above
advice
and
just
opened
the

bottle
with
the
mt

it
exploded
when
i
opened
it
and
lost
at
least
13
of
the
bottle
crap
it
was
more
fullbodied
than
i
remembered
still
alot
of
vanilla
and

some
dull

didnt
leave
the
glowing
impression
ive
had
in
years
past
pours
a

in
color
with
a
light
khaki
head
nose
consists
of
malt
ginger
and
it
has
an
ale
fruitiness
to
it
the
aroma
also
has
hints
of
feint
cinnamon
and
an
odd
medicinal
smell
lingering
in
the
background
fullbodied
mouthfeel
with
ample
carbonation
malty
front
with
flavors
of
spicy
clove
and
light
cinnamon
midway
a
citrus
fruitiness
arrives
the
finish
has
an
unsettling
medicinal
taste
to
it
as
the
beer
warms
the
carbonation
lessens
which
softens
the
taste
and
makes
it
somewhat
more
palatable
there
are
some
unique
flavors
going
on
here
but
the
odd
medicinal
taste
is
rather
offputting
after
one
i
didnt
desire
another
the
folks
at
kiuchi
can
pride
themselves
in
the
fact
that
they
make
what
is
most
likely
the
best
beer
in
japan
a
nice
brew
but
no
cause
for
celebration
pours
a
pretty
deep
orange
color
with
golden
highlights
and
a
touch
of
yeast
suspended
in
the
body
due
to
a
lessthancareful

nice
carbonation
yields
a

inch
of
offwhite

head
that
sticks
around

it
recedes

full
of

and

along
with

creamy
but
the
astringency
leaves
a
tingly
antiseptic
feeling
in

a

if
you
like
spiced
ales
thanks
to
chris
at
ebenezers
pub
for
getting
me
this
it
was
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
small
head
wonderful
spicy
aroma
as
well
as
some
vanilla
the
taste
was
disappointing
a
nice
citrus
tang
spice
mainly
clove
but
i
felt
overwhelmed
by
the
vanilla
the
more
i
drank
the
more
the
vanilla
predominated
not
a
very
exciting
beer
d
above
average
kind
of
tires
out
my
tongue
after
one
not
bad
though
a
fluffy
off
white
head
piles
in
the
pour
in
spite
of
being
the
2005
edition
so
close
to
a
year
old
the
aroma
jumps
up
with
an
assertive
vanilla
and
spice
cinnamon
is
evident
and
the
underlying
spice
i
think
is
the
nutmeg
list
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
coriander
is
in
the
taste
more
and
the
orange
peel
seems
to
be
light
at
this
point
also
a
bit
of
a
musty
taste
not
bad
but
the
beer
definately
aged
and
mellowed
some
of
the
flavors
it
is
has
a
slight
oily
mouthfeel
creamy
in
the
front
and
side
until
it
hits
a
dry
spicy
finishnot
bitterjust
strong
spice
overall
a
pleasant
beer
though
it
didnt
warm
up
well
became
a
bit
cloying
with
the
sweetness
drinkability
nice
spicey
brew
here
that
is
esily
quaffed
since
the
malt
profile
is
a
bit
lighter
than
other
winter
warmers
and
alcohol
doesnt
drive
the
flavor
profile
i
wasnt
super
crazy
about
it
when
fresh
and
its
still
not
really
jiving
with
me
the
ginger
dominates
the
flavor
and
the
high
levels
of
carbonation
seem
to
add
to
that
feel
i
like
ginger
well
enough
but
it
seems
to
interact
oddly
with
the
malt
not
meshing
particularly
well
the
wooden
flavor
is
rather
unappetizing
this
brew
seems
to
be
at
odds
with
itself
wanting
to
be
sweet
but
spicy
and
peppery
as
well
i
think
i
liked
it
better
when
it
was
young
so
the
scores
are
a
half
and
half
a
good
strong
ale
not
overwhelming
or
palate
challenging
but
at
9
id
like
to
see
more
character
in
a
beer
drinkability
definitely
a
palate
pleaser
with
such
a
depth
and
range
of
flavors
particularly
wonderful
the
beer
vastly
improved
as
it
approached
the
warmer
side
the
beer
took
on
a
pineapple
starfruit
tropical
fruit
mix
of
smells
and
flavors
i
would
recommend
serving
this
with
just
the
lightest
chill
possible
hitachino
nest
celebration
ale
is
wonderful
beer
i
had
some
doubts
about
how
this
2004
iteration
has
held
up
over
the
nearly
3
years
since
bottling
but
i
neednt
have
im
happy
to
report
that
its
outstanding
at
the
moment
and
will
likely
last
for
a
while
longer
this
is
far
and
away
my
favorite
kiuchi
beer
and
ill
be
sure
to
buy
every
bottle
that
i
can
lay
my
hands
on
if
im
lucky
enough
to
run
across
it
again
drinkability
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
from
kiuchi
but
it
is
damn
good
big
bold
complex
and
quite
warming
very
enjoyable
good
drinkability
with
a
very
well
hidden
9
abv
an
interesting
brew
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
overall
i
have
enjoyed
the
hitachino
beverages
but
i
think
moreso
for
the
japanese
take
on
western
styles
than
for
the
actual
taste
this
one
has
a
ton
of
spices
i
feel
like
i
was
on
a
journey
through
the
cape
of
good
hope
to
meet
marco
polo
to
bring
back
spices
but
instead
i
decided
to
dive
into
the
barrels
a
bit
on
the
way
does
this
mean
i
was
on
the
wagon
or
off
the
wagon
2
points
for
the
reference
anyway
thats
really
what
you
will
get
out
of
this
brew
extremely
balanced
however
you
can
tell
some
time
was
put
into
this
in
choosing
the
spice
levels
unlike
some
more
popular
winter
beverages
cough
sam
adams
thanks
be
to
lou91
thanks
again
to
greatgallaspy
i
cant
say
there
is
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
on
any
technical
level
but
i
dont
really
like
it
that
much
taken
as
a
whole
the
flavors
just
dont
really
come
together
for
me
overall
a
very
nice
beer
seems
they
put
quite
a
bit
of
effort
into
it
i
like
how
easy
it
is
to
distiquish
each
flavor
in
this
complex
beer
d
this
is
a
wonderful
winter
warmer
it
has
nice
spice
that
really
just
enhance
the
malt
qualities
and
they
dont
need
to
stick
out
on
their
own
in
japanese
cooking
there
are
a
lot
of
very
subtle
flavors
that
still
add
lots
of
complex
this
beer
really
takes
on
that
idea
of
less
is
more
in
the
same
regard
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
the
spices
are
nice
the
beer
is
just
too
sweet
found
this
2004
bottle
in
the
back
of
my
beer
fridge
solid
amber
brown
body
with
sediment
swimming
around
very
cool
the
head
is
billowing
frothy
like
on
a
cappuccino
off
white
with
the
sediment
from
the
bottle
getting
caught
in
the
head
the
head
acts
like
a
filter
catching
the
particles
the
effect
looks
like
cinnamon
has
been
sprinkled
on
top
surprisingly
the
smell
is
tart
slightly
vinegary
almost
flemish
red
like
a
little
green
apple
sent
and
caramel
malt
no
hops
after
a
few
sips
i
get
a
smoky
coffee
sent
too
the
taste
has
a
surprising
hop
presence
and
a
great
chocolate
coffee
aftertaste
very
complex
the
alcohol
and
malt
mix
very
well
on
the
front
creating
that
classic
caramel
and
roasted
malt
flavor
the
balance
is
good
the
hops
are
a
bit
stronger
in
flavor
but
the
alcohol
keeps
them
in
check
with
a
solid
bite
again
very
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
great
very
light
and
carbonated
so
it
evaporates
on
the
tongue
with
those
hop
oils
keeping
the
mouth
feel
slick
and
oily
for
a
9er
the
alcohol
is
present
actually
adding
to
balance
the
beer
but
just
that
the
beer
is
balanced
so
drinkability
i
would
assume
is
how
many
9ers
can
you
handle
in
one
night
d
as
drink
progresses
the
taste
sours
and
becomes
less
enjoyable
alcohol
never
was
a
huge
factor
in
this
beer
drinkable
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
in
this
but
those
spices
are
pleasant
and
not
overdone
wonderful
i
could
sit
down
with
a
few
of
these
the
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
the
only
problem
is
that
at
5
a
pop
for
11
2
ounces
this
celebration
serves
for
special
occasions
this
is
definitely
a
satisfying
addition
to
the
winter
lineup
it
is
rich
and
satiating
and
does
not
have
a
cloying
sweetness
to
muddy
things
up
i
also
like
how
the
spices
are
not
too
strong
they
are
barely
noticeable
individually
and
just
sort
of
integrate
and
make
the
beer
a
bit
more
complex

it

absolutely
no

mediumfull
bodied
with
a
medium

this
is
my
first
beer
from
hitachino
and
its
really
a
wonderful
first
exposure
to
a
good
japanese
brewer
i
will
be
drinking
more
from
them
in
the
future

the

really
can
feel

tingly
feeling
on

from
the
spices
that
almost
feels
slightly
numbing

beer
wow
a
beautiful

an

treat
a
perfect
complement
for
christmas
decorating
i
want
more
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
a
decent
sized
off0white
head
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
a
belgian
tripple
it
had
sweet
malt
in
the
form
of
dates
some
orange
coriander
and
just
a
touch
of
fresh
bread
the
taste
is
very
light
and
citrusy
more
of
the
orange
and
a
bit
of
nectarine
it
has
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
this
blends
well
with
the
added
spice
to
deliver
the
light
citrus
up
front
the
spice
is
very
light
difficult
to
detect
the
coriander
it
feels
like
a
little
pepper
in
the
finish
the
label
said
vanilla
but
i
cant
find
any
here
very
dry
and
smooth
mouth
feel
almost
astringent
ok
drinkability
fullbodied
and
fantastic
i
will
waste
no
more
words
find
it
if
you
can
and
enjoy

color

leaves
a
sticky

in
my
glass
spicy
cinnamon
and
citrus
aroma
vanilla
cinnamon
citrus
and
wheat
flavors
full
bodied
with
a
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
i
like
it
my
tongue
was
just
blessed
with
flavors
of
sees
candy
toffee
bergamont
on
a
balanced
spiced
backbone
complex
and
just
flavorful
the
flavors
just
penetrate
your
taste
buds
and
leave
rich
deep
goodness
i
highly
reccommend
this
brew
its
very
effervescent
and
was
made
to
grace
our
mouths
overall
very
nice
one
not
too
big
and
out
of
control
but
a
very
nice
complex
brew
drinkability
and
notes

the
thinish
body
makes
this
very
drinkable
for
an
eisback
but
that
isnt
actually
what
i
am
looking
for
in
amassive
beer
however
this
is
a
good
version
of
a
strong
bock
and
in
my
opinion
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
hitachino
thus
far
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
very
light
head
that
sits
nicely
atop
the
brew
nose
is
gingerbread
with
a
light
pine
and
moderate
sweetness
reminds
me
of
the
anchor
osa
series
the
flavor
is
less
gingerbready
than
the
flavor
i
get
more
of
the
pine
and
moderate
hop
bitter
i
get
a
slight
metallic
flavor
as
well
nothing
really
drawing
me
in
with
this
one
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
lightmoderate
carbonation
very
pleasing
on
the
palatte
overall
a
pretty
pedestrian
brew
the
alcohol
does
not
come
through
at
all
but
the
flavors
and
aroma
do
not
draw
me
in
at
all
nice
dark
maroon
colored
body
some
suspended
particles
in
the
beer
with
some
carbonation
also
visible
head
is
creamy
and
slow
fading
leaving
a
smal
off
white
layer
on
the
beer
smell
is
sweet
with
spices
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
yes
those
vanilla
beans
it
talks
about
on
the
bottle
taste
is
very
rich
and
smooth
the
spices
impart
a
mild
smokiness
to
the
beer
while
the
vanilla
and
alcohol
give
it
a
sweet
yet
slightly
tingling
burning
sensation
a
very
smooth
drinker
doesnt
challenge
you
very
agreeable
on
the
palate
excellent
probably
the
best
japanese
beer
i
have
ever
had
poured
into
a
chalice
as
an
after
dinner
brew
solid
one
finger
head
that
has
fortitude
and
body
dark
tan
color
almost
brown
in
the
middle
smell
some
metallic
but
after
the
first
drink
it
fades
caramel
was
the
dominant
smell
and
taste
some
burnt
flavors
but
mostly
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
brewery
is
outstanding
and
they
seem
to
push
the
edge
of
their
styles
i
do
think
this
brew
is
at
its
peak
or
close
to
it
coming
into
2006
i
just
wish
they
would
ship
their
beers
over
in
bigger
sizes
as
the
stubie
to
me
is
not
the
greatest
for
long
distance
i
could
have
one
maybe
two
more
but
the
mouthfeel
and
abv
hurt
the
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
interesting
from
start
to
finish
pleasant
spices
strong
alcohol
and
a
nice
malt
base
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
well
balanced
nonetheless
recommended
overall
probably
a
better
beer
closer
to
the
release
date
but
hey
its
still
a
tast
beer
with
an
interesting
vision
we
hope
of
the
japanese
beer
markey
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
huge
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
good
for
the
style
lots
of
dark
fruits
raisins
plums
and
alcohol
and
some
sweetness
very
intense
aromas
the
flavor
is
not
what
i
expected
much
thicker
than
expected
the
dark
fruits
are
very
prominent
but
they
are
melded
with
some
dark
malts
possibly
some
chocolate
malt
very
well
blended
the
alcohol
is
there
only
with
its
warming
character
toward
the
end
very
nice
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
borderline
thick
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
high
alcohol
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
a
deep
copperamber
with
a
slight
haze
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
head
that
settles
to
a
nice
creamy
massaromas
of
green
apple
brown
sugar
with
a
light
smokiness
in
ther
as
well
there
is
so
much
going
on
flavor
wise
its
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
everythingi
get
some
juicy
orange
and
some
spice
like
nutmeg
and
cloves
some
pepper
in
there
like
others
have
notes
as
well
the
sharp
prickly
mouthfeel
is
not
so
great
but
iam
sure
as
it
ages
it
might
round
out
better
i
think
this
one
would
only
get
better
after
putting
up
for
awhile
its
big
and
in
your
face
as
is
drinkability
if
you
dont
drink
this
when
the
opportunity
arises
you
will
do
yourself
an
unbelieveable
disservice
an
absolute
mustdrink
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
color
is
hazy
copper
with
a
goodsized
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
spicy
with
corriander
and
orange
peels
popping
out
the
taste
is
equally
as
spicy
as
the
aroma
a
peppery
wood
taste
is
joined
by
light
touches
of
orange
and
other
spices
a
light
sweetness
is
noted
too
a
combination
of
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
9
abv
is
not
noted
in
the
flavor
at
all
different
tastes
hit
every
part
of
my
tongue
each
with
different
spices
jumping
out
wow
this
is
very
complex
and
interesting
making
it
hard
to
adequately
describe
lots
of
respect
to
kiuchi
for
making
such
an
experimental
brew
drinkability
very
impressive
eisbock
from
this
always
intriguing
japanese
brewery
this
is
one
of
their
better
offerings
and
is
really
an
adventure
to
enjoy
and
sort
through
all
its
nuances
lots
of
complexity
allows
the
high
abv
to
sneak
up
on
you
but
this
one
is
a
lot
of
fun
to
enjoy
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
there
are
lots
of
suspended
yeast
floaties
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
kick
ass
spice
aroma
its
full
of
nutmeg
orange
peel
cinnamon
and
ginger
very
nice
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
refreshing
spice
flavor
that
is
balanced
with
a
solid
malt
base
and
hops
it
has
a
strong
nutmeg
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
bitter
from
the
orange
peel
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
celebration
ale
it
has
awesome
spice
content
a
good
drinker
drinkability
terrific
beer
in
so
many
ways
but
i
would
prefer
just
a
touch
less
carbonation
but
i
feel
that
way
about
a
number
of
belgian
style
beers
not
quite
up
to
par
with
the
2004
which
was
a
favorite
of
mine
to
have
around
til
i
couldnt
find
it
anymore
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
nice
little
beer
and
wouldnt
pass
it
up
for
nothin
the
flavor
has
a
tart
start
hops
folow
then
round
biscuity
malt
and
the
bitterness
returns
at
the
end
vanilla
appears
in
the
nose
and
the
mouth
after
a
bit
the
mouthfeel
is
super
creamy
and
luscious
the
hops
hits
the
back
of
your
throat
at
the
finish
along
with
the
first
suggestion
of
the
high
alcohol
nice
balance
complex
but
organized
really
nice
super
cool
label
on
this
beer
with
a
true
japanese
influence
this
beer
pours
out
a
wicked
fluffy
white
head
into
my
duvel
tulip
the
body
is
a
very
cloudy
brown
leather
with
an
orange
backbone
the
smell
is
like
a
kick
in
the
face
full
of
super
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
like
a
sweet
molasses
burst
in
your
mouth
i
can
pick
up
the
burnt
orange
and
cinnamon
in
this
beer
the
heavy
lacing
stuck
around
until
the
end
this
one
has
a
dangerous
well
hidden
abv
in
it
excellent
beer
and
i
am
excited
to
try
others
from
this
brewery
hail
to
the
land
of
the
rising
sun
poured
a
deep
orangebrown
with
an
explosive
head
puffy
and
thick
and
way
carbonated
had
a
sweet
malty
sugary
smell
with
tangerine
caramel
orange
peel
and
clove
flavors
that
mix
with
some
lemony
hops
in
the
finish
sugary
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
syrupy
sweet
and
fizzy
to
make
it
as
drinkable
as
i
would
like
but
still
wuite
good
i
think
this
one
would
benefit
from
a
couple
more
years
on
the
shelf
will
have
to
grab
another
and
see
what
its
like
in
2007
this
beer
pours
a
super
hazy
orange
color
with
a
large
highly
carbonated
head
aroma
is
strong
on
the
sweet
orange
flavor
and
a
sweet
malty
alcohol
hit
then
a
whole
bunch
of
spices
this
beer
is
packed
with
spices
too
many
to
name
but
heres
what
i
got
sweet
and
bitter
orange
cinammon
vanilla
cloves
coriander
and
nutmeg
these
spices
were
strong
and
unique
but
didnt
really
blend
together
much
the
body
was
medium
and
creamy
with
an
adjunct
rice
flavor
base
a
good
hit
of
alcohol
subdued
the
spices
a
bit
and
warmed
my
belly
the
finish
is
dry
but
im
getting
a
lot
of
fusel
alcohol
esters
in
there
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
promise
and
i
think
in
about
6
months
to
a
year
it
will
be
really
good
however
right
now
its
on
the
rough
side
and
a
bit
too
young
once
to
spices
work
with
each
other
and
the
alcohol
flavor
goes
down
a
little
this
will
be
great
still
this
was
one
unique
beer
experience
poured
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
this
beer
has
a
big
maltaccented
and
caramel
sugary
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
belgian
tripel
my
nose
has
to
search
for
the
spices
described
on
the
label
fairly
fullbodied
for
a
japanese
beer
yet
very
fizzy
the
spices
are
subdued
at
first
but
get
brighter
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
cinnamon
dries
out
the
tongue
in
a
bit
of
an
unpleasant
way
this
effect
is
accented
by
a
dry
finish
a
complicated
spicy
brew
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
even
thoug
the
i
thought
it
to
be
a
little
pricey
at
4
an
11ounce
bottle
kind
of
a
loose
cavernous
pitfall
harry
look
to
head
hazy
orange
hue
with
a
great
deal
of
action
impossible
to
see
through
orange
peel
predominates
on
the
nose
with
some
soluble
white
pepper
and
a
mustard
flash
grock
of
tart
lemon
rind
shredding
that
puckers
the
lips
and
crosses
the
eyes
after
a
time
tongue
and
mouth
become
accustomed
or
numbed
to
this
and
other
aspects
pull
through

a
smart
hop
bite
some
light
wasabi
heat
and
almost
a
rubbery
taste
mouth
cringes
at
first
with
this
one
but
eventually
things
settle
with
a
crisp
alcohol
sting
not
for
the
uninitiated
11
2
oz
bottle
obtained
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
in
feb
2005
and
consumed
a
couple
days
later
huge
hiss
when
i
opened
the
bottle
so
i
poured
as
gentle
as
possible
but
still
got
a
7finger
head
from
just
half
of
the
bottle
a
light
beige
head
over
the
orange
liquid
cloudy
even
though
im
sure
the
yeast
sediment
was
retained
in
the
bottle
of
which
there
is
a
bunch
of
smells
enticing
orange
and
spicy
with
some
gentler
tones
of
caramel
and
vanilla
starts
sweet
with
notiable
alcohol
playing
strongly
over
orange
coriander
and
a
belgianlike
yeasty
funk
has
a
caramel
and
lightly
toffee
flavor
any
bock
character
is
buried
beneath
the
spicing
strong
wet
sugar
and
some
fruity
esters
do
rise
barely
above
the
spices
mediumthick
and
creamysmooth
mouthfeel
and
amazingly
the
carbonation
is
moderate
it
forms
fine
acrid
bubbles
that
dances
with
the
alcohol
burn
couldnt
help
but
get
some
sediment
in
the
beer
now
that
ive
poured
the
second
half
in
but
the
foaming
is
only
about
half
as
bad
as
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
the
small
amount
of
yeast
in
the
beer
definitely
does
not
help
the
flavor
as
it
flattens
some
of
the
fruity
character
and
amplifies
the
funk
and
acrid
what
the
heck
this
beer
is
already
shot
in
goes
the
rest
of
the
yeast
its
now
a
muddy
chocolatey
appearance
of
its
former
self
even
the
head
which
is
still
3fingers
is
darker
a
fullfledged
tan
yeast
is
more
prevalent
in
the
smells
taste
this
is
an
entirely
different
beer
from
the
very
frist
sip
better
than
with
a
smidge
of
the
sediment
in
the
glass
the
spicing
is
more
subdued
and
overall
the
beer
is
flatter
and
more
earthy
still
very
sweet
though
it
ends
now
with
a
milder
alcohol
that
mixes
with
noticable
carameltoffee
no
lacing
and
damn
ive
got
a
buzz
off
of
one
beer
am
i
back
in
jr
high
again
9
ill
bet
its
more
im
glad
i
tried
it
this
was
definitely
a
challenging
beer
but
im
not
interest
in
trying
it
again
so
im
not
going
to
judge
this
as
an
eisbock
as
it
is
presently
categorized
her
on
ba
but
as
a
spiced
beer
too
bad
about
the
excessively
foamy
head
and
clouody
liquid
it
could
have
scored
much
higher
with
time
in
the
bottle
this
could
prove
to
be
a
treat
now
it
is
a
challenge
drinkability
is
good
not
a
bad
little
beer
if
you
love
spicey
beers
this
one
is
for
you
my
bottle
had
2004
on
it
but
it
was
the
spiced
version
2005
for
sure
not
the
eisbock
of
2004
i
dunno
this
beer
is
really
complex
and
very
pretty
im
just
not
all
that
much
into
sweet
brews
drinkability
this
is
going
to
be
a
christmas
regualr
try
only
once
a
year
though
not
sure
if
prunes
and
i
get
along
to
well
damn
interesting
though
pick
one
up
for
a
new
experience
drinkability

you
have
to
try
this
full
effect
beer
just
to
say
youve
had
it
it
is
a
wild
ride
smell
is
strong
alchol
barleywinetype
smell
i
dont
care
for
it
but
it
is
hitting
the
style
right
on
the
nose
i
still
have
to
score
it
low
very
hard
to
drink
all
the
nice
holiday
spices
are
weak
compared
to
the
alcohol
esters
this
is
the
worst
beer
from
hitachino
to
date
overall
my
guess
is
this
brew
might
have
gotten
a
little
long
in
the
tooth
to
be
truly
exceptional
nevertheless
it
is
a
nicely
complex
beer
that
displays
a
wide
breadth
of
tastes
and
aromas
pours
to
a
murky
brownishorange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
spicy
with
coriander
and
nutmeg
at
the
front
in
the
back
of
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
orange
peel
and
cinnamon
the
flavor
is
extremely
spicy
the
nutmeg
and
coriander
hit
me
like
a
ton
of
bricks
i
get
some
ginger
in
here
as
well
the
cinnamon
and
orange
is
also
present
it
has
a
solid
malt
backbone
it
is
fairly
full
bodied
and
warming
a
very
dry
finish
with
this
one
a
unique
holiday
brew
could
only
have
one
though
giant
sticky
marshmallow
head
composed
of
bubbles
of
all
sizes
fills
half
the
glass
and
more
quivering
like
gelatin
where
it
sits
above
the
rim
eerie
orange
glow
extends
from
the
head
through
the
chestnutcolored
liquid
with
amber
highlights
lots
of
protein
floating
around
in
the
beer
leads
to
medium
clarity
with
little
carbonation
to
be
seen
the
head
eventually
dies
although
very
slowly
as
soon
as
the
cap
leaves
the
bottle
the
smell
of
clovestudded
oranges
fills
the
kitchen
after
pouring
the
glass
fumes
with
gigantic
odors
of
spiced
apple
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
which
in
turn
suggests
egg
nog
coriander
gets
stronger
and
right
quick
celery
vegetal
nosefeel
dried
flowers
and
cedar
chips
mental
images
of
primaeval
fern
rainforests
wait
it
gets
weirder
heavy
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavors
can
barely
stand
up
to
coriander
and
celery
seed
cilantro
then
more
nutmeg
raw
assaultive
nutmeg
space
alien
vanilla
pods
swishing
in
my
mouth
i
finally
find
some
light
toffee
flavors
but
im
grasping
for
them
as
i
am
for
plum
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
prickly
and
almost
numbing
from
the
spice
alone
slightly
syrupy
across
the
palate
nutmeg
belches
fit
for
a
toho
monster
rev
up
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
judgement
let
this
be
made
clear
everything
they
list
on
the
label
will
be
tasted
in
turn
and
tasted
big
other
than
that
this
beer
is
like
psilocybin
thats
been
localized
to
affect
only
the
tongue
as
with
psychedelia
the
overall
experience
is
difficult
to
perceive
or
verbalize
because
the
mental
shifts
of
proportion
involved
are
just
too
great
a
beer
that
bends
my
tongue
as
far
back
and
forth
as
this
one
could
be
called
fun
to
a
certain
extent
but
its
just
too
weird
for
me
to
find
truly
enjoyable
taste
was
basically
smooth
and
refreshing
orange
juice
for
me
with
accents
of
balsamic
vinegar
and
cloves
juicy
not
too
spicedmild
not
too
sweetbut
juicy
got
bodybut
not
heavy
good
balance
and
feel
hops
are
way
in
the
background
but
must
be
covering
some
of
the
alcohol
easy
drinkability
for
9
great
spiced
brew
very
refreshing
my
first
review
of
a
beer
from
japan
and
my
first
eisbock
review
all
rolled
into
one
this
poured
out
with
a
murky
opaque
brown
body
with
a
huge
light
tan
head
the
head
falls
leaving
a
cap
of
bubbles
to
cover
the
body
and
leaves
sticky
rings
of
lace
around
the
glass
as
it
is
consumed
fruit
sweetness
with
a
good
touch
of
caramel
stands
out
first
in
the
nose
before
giving
way
to
the
huge
spiciness
in
this
brew
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
where
the
two
spices
i
could
identify
but
there
was
a
lot
more
going
on
in
this
great
smelling
brew
a
nice
caramel
flavor
greets
you
when
you
first
sip
that
is
covered
in
spices
there
was
a
bit
of
fruitiness
to
the
flavor
as
well
as
a
nice
bitter
spicy
after
taste
that
was
excellent
very
complex
in
the
nose
and
mouth
i
will
need
to
gather
a
few
more
of
these
to
full
appreciate
them
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
full
and
it
was
silky
and
left
you
wanting
more
with
every
sip
unfortunately
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
as
after
i
drank
this
i
wanted
more
this
is
definitely
on
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
and
really
left
me
wanted
more
highly
recommended
to
all
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
billowing
offwhite
head
that
bubbles
to
over
2
inches
high
which
leaves
a
decent
lace
damn
thats
some
bubbly
shit
aromas
are
initially
spicey
following
with
some
fig
and
grapes
and
other
yeast
esters
and
a
big
of
dose
of
malt
initial
flavors
are
sharply
or
spice
but
then

this

it
for

overall
this
beer
does
not
live

this

its
a

from
the
heavier
examples
out
there
a
pretty
good
deal
at
8
something
for
a
sixer
nothing
like
any
winter
beer
ive
had
a
really
different
beer
malty
and
nutty
and
sweet
like
other
winter
warmers
but
it
has
a
funny
fruity
tang
to
it
that
makes
for
a
strange
flavor
profile
as
well
as
an
electric
mouthfeel
thats
not
as
mellow
as
i
usually
look
for
in
the
style
i
like
that
its
driven
mostly
by
grain
instead
of
spice
rich
and
toffeelike
in
smell
and
taste
with
some
darker
malts
in
there
too
the
body
is
only
medium
though
and
with
the
high
carbonation
and
the
fruity
zizzle
it
feels
a
lot
lighter
than
i
like
this
time
of
year
it
might
be
a
good
one
to
have
a
few
of
but
the
abv
is
still
appropriately
high
for
the
style
its
a
hard
one
to
reckon
given
the
polarity
of
its
attributes
but
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
elysian
doesnt
always
hit
home
runs
but
they
absolutely
never
make
boring
beer
my
least
favorite
elysian
seasonal
however
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
winter
pale
ale
is
a
fairly
uncommon
style
its
not
my
favorite
from
elysian
but
its
not
bad
malty
and
creamy
a
good
beer
tastes
way
too
sweet
hardly
bitter
at
all
i
had
to
pour
it
down
the
sink
as
i
couldnt
bare
to
finish
it
and
that
hardly
ever
happens
i
really
regret
wasting
10
bucks
on
that
6
pack
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
disliked
an
elysian
beer
not
a
typical
winter
warmer
but
a
well
done
enjoyable
one

22
oz
bottle
given
to
me
as
a
gift
for
cat
sitting
for
a
week

it
i
drank
this
thing
down
in
less
time
than
it
took
to
walk
home
15
mins
just
couldnt
stop
sipping
it
by
far
one
of
the
best
overall
beers
ive
tried
winter
or
otherwise
cheers
overall
above
average
to
good
beer
i
would
definitely
give
it
a
try
as
it
is
a
little
bit
of
a
departure
from
the
norm
it
isnt
wildly
experimental
but
could
give
pause
bifrost
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
almost
reminds
me
of
the
bright
smog
filled
horizon
when
the
sun
sets
in
los
angeles
thankfully
the
aroma
is
much
more
pleasant
with
a
citrus
hop
scent
with
light
tones
of
sweet
malt
and
freshly
cut
flowers
the
taste
was
very
fresh
with
hints
of
citrus
balanced
nicely
with
the
powerful
hop
bitterness
mixed
in
well
was
the
sweet
malt
and
biscuit
like
tones
i
could
slightly
pick
up
on
the
7
6
abv
which
was
a
nice
reminder
that
this
is
a
winter
warmer
the
finish
is
nice
with
a
crisp
dryness
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
o
due
to
the
higher
amount
of
hops
than
normal
for
this
style
it
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
or
sticky
as
some
of
the
other
winter
warmers
that
i
have
tried
also
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
it
did
not
seem
like
it
had
a
lot
of
spices
added
to
it
which
in
my
opinion
made
the
beer
a
little
easier
to
drink
o
this
beer
is
a
little
hoppier
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
so
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
seem
very
heavy
or
sticky
overall
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
the
description
on
the
label
boasts
citrus
and
hops
balanced
by
malt
but
im
just
not
getting
a
lot
of
the
malt
here
as
i
feel
like
you
do
in
a
sn
torpedo
or
dogfish
90
minute
for
ex
i
doubt
this
beer
would
disappoint
any
ipa
fans
though
i
think
to
call
it
a
winter
warmer
is
a
little
misleading
i
went
with
an
aggro
pour
as
the
result
of
my
excitement
and
created
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
good
retention
as
it
slowly
fell
it
left
some
great
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
deepamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
strongly
of
both
minty
hops
and
caramel
malts
much
like
some
aipas
that
i
have
had
of
late
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
reminded
me
more
of
a
young
abw
between
the
preponderance
of
biting
minty
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malt
i
may
try
to
remember
to
buy
an
extra
bottle
for
cellaring
next
year
as
the
result
of
tonights
exercise
finish
was
semidry
with
the
malt
providing
just
enough
of
a
counterbalance
to
keep
it
reasonable
man
this
was
quite
the
find
overall
like
the
beers
name
his
glass
comes
up
big
and
hearty
by
the
end
buzzworthy
a
dry
finish
suggests
complexity
and
a
fitting
afterdinner
drink
o
would
never
have
guessed
this
was
a
winter
warmer
tastes
like
a
pretty
bitter
citrustinged
ipa
overall
ive
had
this
hoppy
winter
warmer
before
and
thought
it
was
fine
but
this
years
version
was
amazing
a
lighter
colored
counterpart
to
sierra
nevada
celebration
emphasizing
the
hops
my
favorite
winter
warmer
this
past
season
o
a
great
beer
but
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
thats
the
only
downfall
pours
a
hazy
orangish

color
with
a
two

head
which
gives
way
to
a
very
nice

aroma
starts
off
with
a
citrus

grapefruit
aroma
there
is
a
slight
bready

end

the
taste
follows
suit
there
is

then
comes
through
with
a
grapefruit

flavor
the
backend
has
a
pine
hop
taste
the
taste
is
there
but
is
slightly
thin
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
maybe
slightly
watery
overall
it
was
a
very
average
beer
there
just
wasnt
enough
going
on
to
make
me
want
it
again
overall
i
have
seen
cases
of
this
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
have
more
than
one
only
sightly
like
a
winter
warmer
and
far
from
even
an
old
ale
which
i
kind
of
expected
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
and
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
also
mild
malts
some
citrus
and
a
big
alcohol
taste
at
the
finish
the
spices
usually
associated
with
this
style
seem
to
be
missing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
overall
i
actually
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
a
good
but
not
overly
so
resinous
hop
flavor
that
melded
well
with
the
lighter
fruit
citrus
and
malty
flavors
of
the
brew
cheers

very

mirky

for
a
beer
like
this
good
balance
between
bitter
and
sweat
overall
a
very
nice
beer
although
a
bit
out
of
style
winter
ale
is
a
wide
category
but
this
still
seems
to
miss
the
mark
this
is
one
heady
and
hoppy
warmer
malty
dipas
arent
my
thing
so
the
comparison
is
a
little
distasteful
but
its
a
warmer
and
it
works
just
fine
i
like
the
approach
enjoyable
a
kind
of
ipaish
winter
warmer
o
i
really
like
this
beer
i
think
they
use
a
different
yeast
in
this
than
most
american
winter
ales
its
pretty
sweet
and
probably
best
enjoyed
with
a
glass
of
water
to
clear
the
palate
every
few
drinks
as
it
leaves
behind
some
sugary
syrup
feeling
i
cant
recommend
this
as
a
winter
warmer
at
all
its
an
interesting
pseudowinter
pale
ale
but
it
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
there
either
this
maybe
needs
a
rebrand
and
a
little
tuning
not
a
big
fan
would
not
buy
again

this
is
my

its

is

a

it
does
bring
those
to

after

i
had
to
peek
at

reviewers
and
i
saw
one
which
mentioned
cardamom
ratsexactly
what
id
been
tasting
and
could
just
not
pinpoint
myself
well
ill
add
anise
to
that
the
two
of
which
will
account
for
the
unanticipated
spice

very
happy
with
this
winter
warmer
o
surprised
that
the
beer
is
labeled
as
a
winter
warmer
came
off
more
like
a
pale
ale
or
an
ipa
to
me
at
first
liked
it
but
liked
it
less
as
it
warmed
enjoyable
winter
beer
with
orange
and
cinnamon
spice
pours
amber
with
not
much
head
medium
carbonation
which
made
it
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
lots
of
malt
and
caramel
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
coming
out
on
the
finish
overall
i
liked
it
a
lot
sampled
on
draft
at
elysian
fields
out
of
a
basic
pint
glass
light
orange
to
bronze
in
color
with

abv
but
it
goes
down
easy
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
classified
incorrectly
i
would
call
it
a
pale
ale
perhaps
just
alright
and
im
not
sure
i
would
have
another
this
beer
isnt
offense
its
just
sort
of
there
its
fairly
bland
and
the
earthyspicy
finish
wore
on
me
after
a
while
o
this
is
okay
wish
it
had
a
little
hop
bite
to
it
just
a
bit
then
i
would
be
all
over
this
beer
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
ive
enjoyed
some
of
their
other
beers
but
im
content
with
skipping
this
one
in
the
future
a
nice
biscuity
malt
complements
some
very
well
balanced
citrus
and
pine
hop
notes
that
leave
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
back
the
citrus
is
of
the
orange
rind
variety
in
its
dry
and
crisp
mouthfeel
and
finish
quick
and
clean
feel
but
remains
a
fullbodied
beer
with
that
biscuity
malt
providing
character
beyand
the
hops
that
malt
tends
to
linger
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
its
smooth
in
front
and
then
a
little
prickly
in
the
back
with
the
tingle
of
hops
and
booze
the
warming
alcohol
is
definitely
detectable
but
adds
another
layer
of
depth
to
the
beer
the
hops
really
make
this
one
as
they
are
perfectly
balanced
in
their
bitterness
lending
a
nice
complement
to
the
malt
bill
and
vice
versa
the
mediumhigh
carbonation
levels
are
nice
as
the
mouthfeel
is
the
other
part
that
makes
this
beer
so
enjoyably
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
beer
full
flavored
and
lots
of
character
i
recommend
and
i
would
probably
seek
this
out
again
this
is
a
very
good
to
style
beer
that
wont
disappoint
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
winter
warmer
and
certainly
not
a
strong
ale
reminded
me
of
a
malty
ipa
as
it
had
some
hops
and
nose
real
spices
not
bad
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
o
good
for
the
style
o
i
prefer
my
winter
ales
sweeter
and
maltier
than
this
along
with
more
prominent
additives
such
as
herbs
and
spices
this
reminded
me
more
of
an
ipa
than
anything
i
like
elysian
their
stuff
is
available
good
priced
and
good
tasting
streak
of
zero
not
recommendeds
for
them
still
intact
mouthfeel
again
light
for
a
winter
warmer
good
carbonation
highly
drinkable
in
the
summertime
and
highly
drinkable
in
general
good
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
bottle
from
a
private
vancouver
store
winter
warmer
in
the
summer
to
change
things
up
from
what
is
normally
available
pours
light
yellow
with
an
orange
tinge
and
a
foamy
white
head
that
retains
one
quarter
of
an
inch
lace
shows
through
as
i
drink
it
malty
and
spicey
aroma
expecting
lots
of
taste
notes
i
am
getting
mostly
malt
and
then
barley
hops
spice
including
ginger
and
cardommon
funegeek
and
cinammon
average
mouthfeel
with
drying
finish
decent
drinkability
poured
a
light
copper
with
a
nice
white
head
and
some
carbonation
visible
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
nose
malty
to
the
tongue
spice
is
very
subdued
and
not
too
distinctive
for
a
winter
warmer
a
little
citrus
bitterness
in
there
maybe
just
a
tad
of
pine
or
juniper
lightmedium
body
a
little
harsh
and
not
overly
drinkable
for
a
style
that
usually
promises
sweetness
and
spice
a
decent
ale
that
is
victimized
by
its
mouthfeel
i
didnt
ask
for
any
cotton
in
my
beer
o
the
bad
news
is
its
not
what
i
expected
in
a
winter
warmer
the
good
news
is
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
most
winter
warmers
this
could
better
be
sold
as
a
malted
up
ipa
i
like
it
and
in
the
end
found
it
interesting
bonus
points
for
no
added
spice
just
whats
natural
in
the
hops
pretty
good
little
brew
pours
an
attrative
hazed
amber
orange
nice
cap

frothy
white

with

and

and
orange
all
present
touches
of

with
a
smooth
and
lightly
sweet
carmel
backbone
and
a
kiss
of
seasonal
spices
taste
again
makes
with
think
ipa
with
a
sold
fruity
hop
profile
but
backed
by
a
solid
yet
not
cloyingly
sweet
light
carmel
and
butterscotch
backbone
medium
bodied
feels
smooth
and
slightly
coating
of
the
mouth
unqiue
in
its
construction
big
citrus
and
fruity
hop
profile
big
carmel
and
butterscotch
backbone
both
wrk
exceptionally
well
together
surprisingly
light
in
colour
sort
of
an
english
strong
ale
with
some
additional
american
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
huge
edge
of
carbonation
there
carb
hits
with
the
bitterness
and
is
quite
harsh
lingering
citrus
bitterness
overall
this
one
is
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
it
could
use
something
to
tie
it
all
together
nice
winter
beer
that
is
really
a
double
ipa
with
some
citrus
notes
and
a
generous
helping
of
hops
i
also
detected
some
piney
flavour
that
reminded
me
of
the
spruce
tips
in
the
alaskan
winter
ale
very
drinkable
but
still
complex
enough
to
sip
winter
warmers
come
in
many
styles
overall
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
as
the
bitterness
upfront
was
a
little
unbalanced
the
warmer
from
the
alcohol
burn
and
the
ending
sweetness
was
excellent
an
nice
brew
the
alcohol
warmth
isnt
intrusive
and
it
sort
of
sneaks
up
on
you
that
said
ive
had
winter
beers
that
are
morre
cloying
and
exhibit
a
higher
alcohol
burn
even
at
a
lower
abv
a
very
good
ww
im
a
fan
not
sure
if
this
should
be
classified
as
a
winter
warmer
since
it
really
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
style
american
strong
ale
seems
like
a
better
fit
this
was
by
easily
the
cheapest
bomber
on
the
shelf
and
my
only
other
experience
with
elysian
was
a
good
one
so
i
decided
to
pick
this
up
pours
a
dark
clear
golden
orange
with
a
bone
white
head
big
foamy
head
that
never
really
goes
away
and
leaves
thick
chunky
lace
scent
is
citrus
hops
and
orange
rind
taste
is
subtle
hops
and
spice
up
front
with
a
sweet
malty
backbone
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
not
as
carbonated
as
it
looks
honestly
i
had
a
hard
time
rating
this
one
a
good
beer
but
not
at
all
what
i
expected
for
a
winter
warmer
i
know
its
a
winter
seasonal
but
it
feels
kind
of
mislabeled
as
a
winter
warmer
pleasing
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
a
bite
of
carbonation
over
all
a
really
nice
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
winter
warmer
than
a
dipa
super
lacing
too
very
good
and
not
in
spite
of
its
closer
resembles
to
dfh

looks

something
i
almost
expected
it
to
be
brown
smell
was
odd
and
the
taste
was
worse
it
really
had
this
weird
orange
rind
flavor
citrusy
in
a
very
bad
way
the
alcohol
was
noticable
and
overall
i
just
didnt
care
for
this
beer
at
all
at
least
it
was
not
very
expensive
d
highly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
with
an
abv
that
wont
put
you
under
the
table
ill
be
rating
this
one
more
on
overall
taste
then
to
style
a
surprising
and
clear
dichotomy
of
sweetness
upfront
and
bitter
linger
flavors
are
clear
and
bright
not
what
i
expect
in
a
winter
ale
as
it
has
an
almost
springtime
feel
to
it
but
its
just
malty
enough
to
keep
you
from
shivering
in
the
cold
its
also
not
what
i
would
like
in
a
winter
warmer
but
this
is
just
fantastic
simple
yet
well
done
poured
into
a
imperial
nonic
a
dull
burnt
orange
color
with
a
large
well
formed
sticky
egg
shell
colored
head
that
took
its
time
settling
into
creamy
froth
aromas
are
on
the
lighter
side
mainly
earthy
hops
along
with
some
overripe
citrusthe
palate
is
quite
dry
with
earthy
hop
being
the
main
componentfaint
citrus
fruit
and
a
crisp
malt
base
are
the
other
maint
points
a
decent
brew
but
it
might
be
a
little
to
dry
and
earthy
for
my
tastes
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
perhaps
misclassified
as
i
would
not
consider
a
traditional
winter
warmer
it
is
a
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
but
but
was
i
was
expecting
a
much
maltier
beer
because
it
is
a
winter
warmer
this
is
almost
like
an
ipa
not
bad
but
really
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
what
style
this
beer
fits
into
its
tasty
but
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
it
just
seems
to
taste
more
like
your
average
run
of
the
mill
ipa
rather
than
a
special
winter
brew
not
bad

trying

elysian
is
not
necessarily
my
favorite
brewery
but
this
beer
rather
floats
my
boat
good
stuff
d
ive
been
real
into
winter
warmer
beers
lately
and
this
one
for
me
is
just
ok
definately
one
of
my
least
favorite
elysian
beers
the
bifrost
is
an
angelic
creature
mightily
ringed
like
saturn
and
orange
like
its
glower
it
appears
the
recipe
has
changed
from
centennial
to
simcoe
bittering
according
to
their
menu
and
the
smoothness
of
the
bitterness
i
would
attribute
to
this
alteration
bristle
and
pine
slight
earthy
spice
and
floral
big
aromas
but
im
not
getting
much
citrus
a
hint
perhaps
the
finish
is
amarillo
and
styr
goldings
a
little
bit
of
sweet
bread
tastes
like
these
hops
are
licking
your
teeth
nice
bitterness
but
very
sticky
and
very
delicious
dangerous
folks
over
there
crafting
this
beast
overall
a
nice
winter
beer
it
does
warm
you
up
a
bit
but
it
is
not
dominated
by
malt
like
many
winter
beers
not
a
fantastic
beer
but
it
is
quite
tasty

good
hoppy
winter
brew
could
be
richer
have
more
malt
character
still
very
good
nice
bitterness
bi
frost
looks
like
a
lighter
version
of
a
winter
warmer
from
looks
alone
its
not
as
dark
as
most
in
the
spectrum
hazed
golden
with
burnt
orange
with
some
coppa
nice
sheet
of
lace
on
the
way
down
when
real
cold
this
smells
like
a
pale
malted
monster
with
sweet
malt
galore
some
warming
brings
forth
some
light
spice
but
not
one
type
i
can
put
my
finga
on
taste
is
the
same
sweet
malt
completely
engulfs
this
beer
when
cold
but
warming
brings
spice
a
very
lightly
spiced
warmer
here
this
one
is
hard
to
describe
kinda
simple
body
is
medium
with
a
malty
sweet
profile
carb
on
the
low
end
this
aint
half
bad
one
of
the
easier
drinking
winter
warmers
ive
had
i
would
go
for
another
check
out
my
beerfly
review
on
the
brewery
overall
drinkable
if
only
that
its
alot
like
water
pours
cloudy
and
golden
with
a
decent
white
head
smells
sweet
and
fruity
taste
is
strongly
fruity
apricot
banana
pineapple
caramel
with
slight
bitterness
slightly

finish
mouthfeel
is

and
thick
d
never
expected
this
to
be

until
i
started
this
review
would
have
guessed
6
tops
went
down
that
easy
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
im
not
quite
sure
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
its
pretty
good
but
id
like
to
know
what
they
were
going
for
instead
of
just
some
spiel
about
a
rainbow
bridge
and
such
d
i
know
the
style
says
winter
warmer
but
this
is
pretty
much
a
straight
ahead
american
ipa
in
my
book
its
a
nice
beer
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
this
overcrowded
style
as
with
the
other
elysian
beers
ive
had
im
curious
as
to
how
true
this
contract
brewed
version
is
to
the
original
the
body
is
much
lighter
than
most
of
the
style
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
look
forward
to
multiple
pints
every
winter
as
i
said
im
surprised
my
score
isnt
higher
maybe
my
mind
is
playing
tricks
on
me
or
maybe
its
a
result
of
elysians
partnership
with
new
belgium
but
i
remember
this
beer
being
darker
heartier
and
more
robust
in
the
past
certainly
still
worth
your
time
decent
brew
for
a
winter
warmer
a
style
i
find
myself
generally
unimpressed
by
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
sweet
a
little
hoppy
lots
of
sweet
malts
and
sugary
thick
fruitiness
can
taste
the
munich
and
crystal
malts
honey
like
the
midas
touch
in
the
faintest
of
notes
i
found
this
highly
drinkable
a
good
nonthreatening
gateway
beer
for
those
looking
to
introduce
something
new
to
their
bmc
friends
this
holiday
season
a
very
good
beer
not
what
i
was
really
expecting
though
but
i
dont
know
where
to
place
this
beer
not
a
apa
or
ipa
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
winter
warmer
its
very
interesting
and
i
would
try
it
again
a
winter
ale
that
manages
to
succeed
without
spices
bifröst
silly

also

with
a
creamy
lasting
head
this
beer
has
an
interesting
blend
of
european
and
american
hop
aromas
grapefruits
and
grass
its
much
more
hop
assertive
than
i
was
expecting
but
there
is
a
definite
doughy
malt
presence
the
taste
is
mildly
dry
with
a
pleasant
medium
bitterness
its
a
mediumbodied
beer
with
a
touch
of
wateriness
in
the
finish
the
finish
is
nice
and
bitter
good
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
in
the
hops
department
maybe
the
beers
will
improve
with
practice
but
ill
wait
and
see
before
buying
anything
else
in
this
series
perhaps
ill
just
have
to
make
a
trip
to
the
northwest
to
try
them
at
the
source
one
of
these
days
good
drinkability
but
at
7
5
abv
drink
it
in
moderation
overall
a
tasty
hop
driven
ale
elysian
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
wish
they
would
do
six
packs
i
cant
always
squeeze
in
the

for
a

elysian
and
they
have
some
solid
brews
but
this
one
doesnt
really
stack
up
compared
to
other
year
round
brews
overall
a
very
hoppy
example
of
the
style
hop
bitterness
and
spice
overshadows
what
malt
there
is
more
malt
presence
would
help
balance
the
astringency
in
the
finish
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
average
carbonation
flavor
is
some
grainy
malt
notes
and
caramel
and
then
rolls
to
a
hit
of
peppery
booze
and
some
generally
bitey
hops
the
beer
isnt
quite
what
i
expected
when
i
purchased
but
it
was
enjoyable
just
crisper
and
more
bite
than
anticipated
very
smooth
thick
fruitiness
thick
taste
notes
purchased
from
the
discount
rack
at
halftime
beverage
in
poughkeepsie
for
2
99
in
earlytomidmay
it
was
about
a
month
past
its
best
by
date
at
that
point
so
i
took
a
chance
i
put
it
in
the
dbf
right
away
and
drank
it
about
a
month
later
i
didnt
get
any
off
notes
or
evident
oxidation
so
i
think
it
was
ok
perhaps
there
wouldve
been
more
of
a
hoppy
character
had
i
drank
it
back
in
march
however
id
certainly
consider
getting
a
fresh
one
next
winter
though
i
must
admit
the
regular
5
99
sticker
might
lead
me
somewhere
else
md
alot
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
nice
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
nothing
too
overpowering
interestingly
enough
a
friend
of
mine
who
works
in
a
beer
store
recommended
this
as
a
great
summer
beer
much
better
than
the
normal
light
summer
swill
that
everyone
else
want
to
sell
im
stocking
up
sample
at
the
pike
street
location
this
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
spicy
aroma
with
notes
of
malt
and
fruit
mediumbodied
with
flavors
of
toasted
malt
honey
and
sweet
spices
followed
by
mild
hops
and
fruit
the
finish
is
sweet
and
spiced
with
light
hops
and
citrus
aftertaste
decent
all
around
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
grainy
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
with
some
bisquit
characteristics
there
is
an
excellent
hop
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
very
smooth
malty
flavor
that
really
showcases
the
pale
and
munich
malts
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
stiff
hop
bitterness
and
grainy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
winter
warmer
its
not
all
spiced
up
its
just
a
solid
beer
with
added
alcohol
and
hops
a
7
5
abv
is
hidden
well
and
it
really
is
a
good
winter
beer
not
heavy
and
had
good
aroma
and
flavor
i
should
note
as
well
that
this
is
contract
brewed
by
new
belgium
and
has
a
laserprinted
date
of
10
apr
09
on
the
label
im
guessing
a
best
by
date
as
this
is
2
march
09
its
incode
but
pretty
close
however
i
dont
find
a
single
note
of
oxidation
what
im
picking
up
is
clearly
munich
malts
and
soft
caramel
and
the
hop
flavors
are
right
on
so
in
addition
to
kudos
for
elysian
i
have
to
also
give
kudos
to
new
belgium
a
charming
and
enticing
beer
to
be
sure
a
tasty
malt
forward
ale
which
bucks
the
typical
winter
trends
well
i
dont
know
what
the
umlaut
is
all
about
but
the
beer
itself
is
a
warm
blended
batch
of
winter
solace
the
aroma
could
offer
a
little
more
but
its
very
solid
otherwise
the
abv
is
cozy
and
fits
well
with
the
seasonal
motif
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
i
wouldnt
be
happy
to
find
this
under
my
tree
elysians
primary
winter
beer
shows
an
exceptionally
clear
pale
ale
color
with
exuberant
carbonation
sustaining
a
carpet
of
lumpy
white
foam
and
striated
lace
it
delivers
an
unexpected
fruitiness
given
its
paleness
and
clarity
along
with
a
punky
marshmallow
aroma
but
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
to
the
last
with
firm
bittering
and
an
irresistibly
smooth
body
a
winter
ale
warmly
received
golden
pour
with
a
hazy
amber
center
bubbles
struggle
through
a
visual
thickness
a
creamy
layer
of
thin
head
exists
aroma
exudes
sweetness
reminiscent
of
orange
blossom
honey
and
caramel
malts
the
first
introduction
of
this
beer
to
the
palate
screams
thickness
and
heat
which
is
welcome
at
the
7
5
level
on
a
chilly
winter
night
the
predominant
fruity
aspect
of
the
prominent
amarillo
hops
compliment
the
honey
notes
perfectly
the
beer
finishes
with
a
faint
planty
bitterness
and
a
zip
of
taut
carbonation
with
warmth
the
hop
profile
opens
up
and
allows
more
earthy
bitterness
to
appear
in
the
finish
the
beer
appears
to
transform
itself
from
a
golden
strong
ale
to
an
extra
pale
ale
with
an
additional
10
degrees
fahrenheit
not
the
most
complex
but
a
nice
hearty
sipper
that
offers
respite
from
a
season
full
of
big
stouts
and
barleywines
d
medium
body
balanced
with
the
carbonation
a
little
too
much
heat
to
be
sessionable
could
very
well
improve
with
a
couple
of
months
in
the
bottle
drinkability
this
is
a
hearty
ale
that
is
great
on
a
cold
evening
the
bomber
bottle
is
a
nice
size
for
this
one
d
the
flavor
was
fairly
unique
and
quite
different
per
style
though
not
one
i
would
drink
in
multiples
or
find
particularly
warming
like
most
winter
brews
more
funky
and
sour
then
anything
with
a
good
helping
of
bitter
hoppiness
and
sour
tangerine
character
makes
this
an
intriquing
try
thought
with
limited
repeatability
there
is
a
good
burn
from
the
alcohol
a
nice
one
for
the
winter
season
i
couldnt
taste
or
feel
the
alcohol
in
this
and
im
quite
suprised
that
its
7
50
if
i
was
given
this
without
looking
at
the
label
i
would
feel
that
it
would
be
an
offering
from
sierra
nevada
since
the
consistency
and
moutfeel
was
similar
to
the
pale
ale
especially
in
the
carbonation
regardless
this
was
a
good
beer
but
given
another
chance
id
wait
until
it
was
a
bit
warmer
outside
before
i
had
it
again
final
musings
a
very
hoppy
seasonal
in
the
vein
of
sn
celebration
but
not
as
good
probably
could
drink
the
whole
bottle
myself
but
id
be
craving
something
with
a
little
more
spice
and
malt
afterwards
there
really
was
not
much
in
the
way
of
spices
that
i
could
pick
up
taste
is
a
bit
watery
light
grapefruit
hops
apricot
some
pine
spice
a
touch
of
white
pepper
and
some
malt
is
hiding
in
the
back
ends
slightly
on
the
dry
side
drinkability
elysian
likes
to
make
things
a
bit
different
sometimes
think
jasmine
ipa
and
this
falls
into
that
category
i
dont
love
it
but
i
sure
do
like
it
quite
a
bit
pours
a
dirty
golden
color
with
some
orange
highlights
and
a
pure
white
head
that
left
some
mighty
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
fairly
bready
with
a
subtle
juicy
hop
looks
like
the
makings
of
an
apa
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
a
nice
bready
malt
with
a
dab
of
honey
and
a
nice
juicy
hop
flavor
profile
hops
used
more
for
flavor
than
for
bittering
the
feel
is
thick
and
chewy
soft
carbonation
leads
to
a
nice
silky
feel
finishes
sweet
an
enjoyable
brew
though
not
sure
of
the
winter
warmer
status
a
nice
malty
apa
pours
a
transparent
amber
orange
color
with
a
large

of
clean
pale
malt
husky
grain
and
gentle
bitter
hops
citrus
fruit
brown
sugar
herbalearthy
notes
and
caramel
on
the
tongue
im
really
enjoying
the
fruity
bitter
blast
just
before
the
finish
warming
for
sure
but
the
alcohol
doesnt
seems
maybe
a
bit
too
apparent
muddling
the
beers
main
profile
fairly
drinkable
definitely
a
good
alternative
to
some
of
the
over
spiced
winter
offerings
out
there
it
just
doesnt
strike
me
as
anything
to
write
home
about
taste
is
earthy
bitter
hops
some
breadiness
good
amount
of
sweet
malt
character
to
offset
the
hop
bitters
a
bit
of
fruit
in
the
finish
medium
dry
bitter
finish
very
nice
beer
tastes
like
a
very
full
bodied
pale
ale
some
blessed
relief
from
the
brown
sugar
winter
warmers
winter
seasonals
are
usually
dark
and
malty
elysians
bifrost
is
a
good
mix
of
malts
and
hops
and
it
appears
to
be
unfiltered
i
suggest
drinking
this
one
at
a
very
cold
temperature
near
freezing
for
best
flavor
i
think
that
new
belgiums
mass
production
of
this
beer
has
hurt
the
overall
quality
and
flavor
profile
still
an
average
to
good
selection
at
a
reasonable
price
for
a
bomber
warming
there
is
a
bitter
hop
balance
to
the
sweetness
and
spicing
not
bad
just
not
a
big
fan
of
it
i
like
hoppy
winter
beers
but
this
just
didnt
go
in
the
right
direction
for
me
to
think
anything
great
of
it
a
bit
too
bready
to
boot
overall
not
horrible
but
just
didnt
dig
this
1
i
couldnt
detect
any
r
eal
flavors
because
ofthe
boozy
alcohol
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
1
give
it
a
shot
my
taste
buds
are
strange
this
was
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
it
pours
up
a
murky
copper
color
with
a
white
head
the
nose
was
very
bready
and
there
was
something
else
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
is
subtle
hops
bready
subtle
malts
earthy
full
bodied
nice
nick
b
3
50
d
a
tasty
ale
but
it
kind
of
lost
my
interest
a
bomber
is
good
but
not
a
stand
out
among
some
very
good
beers
in
elysians
lineup
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
but
just
kind
of
bland
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
rich
and
creamy
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
spicy
finish
a
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
though
it
is
lacking
in
depth
and
could
be
a
bit
darker
for
me
delicious
stuff
elysian
im
glad
i
finally
tryed
them
bottle
from
spruce

in
philly

golden

good
mouthfeel

heavy
not

d
very
unique
and
very
drinkable
i
expected
something
different
but
elysian
has
put
a
cool
spin
on
the
winter
warmer
bomber
bottle
pours
lighter
amber
with
an
orange
glow
off
white
tiny
bubble
head
long
lasting
frothy
and
then
leaving
real
nice
fine
lace
and
plenty
of
fine
sheeting
muted
bready
nose
this
one
looks
and
drinks
more
like
an
american
pale
then
a
ww
creamy
and
pleasing
on
the
tongue
hops
come
through
loud
and
clear
grainy
and
citric
and
then
smooth
and
mellow
in
the
finish
real
nice
moderately
hoppy
sessioner
a
pleasant
seasonal
new
comer
to
the
elysian
line
well
worth
a
try
pours
a
wonderfully
thick
creamy

and
never
quits
aroma
is
yeasty
with
a
nose
full
of
malts
taste
is
very
creamy
and
a
very
nice
bite
of
the
golding
hops
almost
like
a
cream
ale
but
oh
so
much
better
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
highly
recommended
reviewed
the
2008
version
d
nice
complexity
in
an
easydrinking
beer
i
could
sit
down
with
a
few
of
these
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
fizzy
offwhite
head
minimal
sticky
lacing
on
this
one
the
nose
is
maltyhoppy
nice
tones
of
citruspines
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
nice
blend
of
maltshops
the
citruspines
are
a
nice
touch
with
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
recommended
very
different
winter
warmer
but
the
7
alcohol
will
light
a
fire
although
very
sneakily
give
one
a
try
when
next
years
batch
comes
out
drinkability
a
solid
beer
something
a
little
different
for
a
winter
seasonal
pours
amber
with
a
relatively
thin
head
but
some
decent
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
malt
grain
and
a
bit
of
light
spice
as
well
as
some
yeasty
esters
with
a
bit
of
pear
and
apple
in
them
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
to
start
but
becomes
more
savory
with
grain
breadiness
some
bitter
and
almost
a
meatiness
like
roast
pork
somewhat
slick
mouthfeel
and
a
litttle
viscous
as
well
i
dont
love
this
beer
but
its
fairly
interesting
and
pretty
pleasant
even
if
the
flavors
develop
a
litle
strangely
drinks
a
bit
slow
due
to
complexity
but
this
is
one
damn
fine
winter
warmer
or
dipa
ill
certainly
check
out
other
brews
from
elysian
excellent
winter
brew
not
too
bitter
or
strong
but
so
so
so
tasty
this
is
yet
another
exclamation
point
of
a
great
beer
for
this
fine
micro
brewery
out
of
seattle
this
place
continues
to
produce
some
of
the
best
beer
in
the
northwest
and
this
big
guy
is
awesome
i
had
this
beer
in
a
22
ounce
bottle
and
cried
when
it
was
gone
i
want
more
the
bifrost
is
a
cloudy
light
orange
the
bottle
comes
in
a
plain
label
with
no
freshness
date
i
am
a
big
fan
of
jubelale
and
this
is
a
nice
alternative
the
bifrost
leaves
a
nice
sudsy
lacing
after
math
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
mellow
malt
and
pine
in
the
taste
i
get
the
pineness
and
cinnamon
and
cloves
it
leaves
a
nice
bitter
malt
that
is
a
little
chewy
going
down
it
is
a
good
winter
brew
not
a
real
drinkable
beer
the
bourbon
flavors
are
a
bit
strong
and
the
abv
makes
is
less
than
sessionable
i
had
one
and
ill
pass
this
one
up
again
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
bifrost
is
a
bright
clear
orangish
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
leaving
behind
a
sticky
beautifully
patterned
lace
the
aroma
is
bright
and
fruity
mainly
peach
and
some
citrus
with
some
piny
hops
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
malty
but
not
too
thick
with
caramel
and
sweet
fruit
esters
a
very
bitter
hop
finish
and
a
lot
more
alcohol
bite
than
is
necessary
for
the
7
5
abv
like
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
balanced
and
quite
pleasant
helping
the
bifrost
goes
down
quite
nicely
but
the
overly
bitter
aftertaste
prevents
this
warmer
from
being
all
that
drinkable
right
now
i
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
so
im
curious
to
see
how
it
matures
over
the
next
year
but
i
doubt
ive
have
trouble
holding
out
that
long
easily
one
of
the
most
impressive
limited
offerings
ive
had
recently
certainly
not
your
typical
winter
warmer
but
was
perfect
for
me
poured
from
the
22oz
bottle
in
to
a
pint
glass
body
is
a
bright
golden
hue
with
a
huge
sligthtly
creamy
stark
white
head
that
leaves
some
beautiful
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
piney
hops
and
sweet
pale
malt
with
a
nice
whiff
of
alcohol
thrown
in
for
good
measure
palate
is
nicely
balaced
between
pale
malt
and
piney
hops
with
light
fruity
notes
lingering
in
the
background
and
a
touch
of
mustiness
from
the
yeast
finish
is
nice
and
clean
with
just
a
little
bit
of
warming
from
the
alcohol
body
is
smooth
and
just
a
tad
sticky
a
very
good
consistency
for
this
type
of
ale
i
think
im
going
to
be
drinking
a
lot
of
this
until
it
goes
away
for
the
season
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
a
wonderful
beer
and
more
a
winter
ipa
than
a
winter
warmer
and
i
love
it
for
that
taste
is
robust
in
its
malts
chewy
browns
compliment
the
addition
of
spices
and
a
warming
alcoholic
sensation
finishes
with
a
dry
palate
i
found
this
a
nice
enough
beer
but
i
think
for
me
one
bomber
at
a
sitting
is
enough
the
bitter
aftertaste
tends
to
deter
another
bottle
i
love
elysian
beer
so
i
fully
expected
to
love
bifrost
as
much
i
love
the
immortal
ipa
the
wise
esb
night
owl
pumpkin
and
all
the
rest
although
it
doesnt
quite
rise
to
those
heights
its
still
a
worthwhile
seasonal
from
a
brewery
that
deserves
much
more
attention
than
it
gets
mucho
yummy
stuff
must
find
book
toolie
toolie
orange
sky
is
beautiful
yumyum
huh
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
very
dissapointing
head
that
failed
to
rise
the
aroma
is
of
light
citrus
peel
and
spices
the
taste
is
light
but
packs
a
very
heavy
hop
punch
suprising
very
tasty
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
winter
still
nice
a
perfect
beer
for
those
cold
northwest
nights
this
beer
poured
a
gorgeous
deep
honey
color
with
a
fair
head
and
some
moderate
lacing
it
was
quite
fragrant
with
a
very
fruity
scent
which
immediately
reminded
me
of
strawberries
mouthfeel
was
rich
with
a
bit
of
syrup
texture
which
coated
the
mouth
the
only
real
downpoint
was
that
after
swallowing
there
wasnt
much
finish
overall
a
great
very
drinkable
winter
ale
that
is
hearty
and
warming
just
what
a
winter
ale
should
be
a
very
nice
drinking
big
beer
even
though
the
body
is
pretty
huge
doesnt
seem
overly
strong
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
offwhite
head
above
the
light
amber
brew
head
is
doughy
and
hangs
around
with
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
pleasantly
of
piney
hops
a
nice
change
for
me
from
some
of
the
overspiced
brews
that
end
up
in
this
style
taste
is
light
yet
ample
maltiness
up
front
quickly
overtaken
by
the
aforementioned
piney
hops
character
which
segues
ever
so
gently
into
the
slightest
spicing
at
the
close
alcohol
warming
sneaks
up
on
you
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
excellent
a
great
nw
interpretation
of
a
style
that
isnt
always
my
favorite
i
must
admit
find
this
one
its
worth
the
effort
notes
good
solid
beer
very
drinkable
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
drinkability
is
above
average
alcohol
permeates
a
tad
too
much
to
be
a
great
beer
but
true
to
style
pours
a
hazy
orangecopper
color
it
is
topped
by
a
frothy
light
tan
head
the
aroma
smells
initially
of
hops
with
notes
of
citrus
and
pine
as
i
dig
deeper
the
hops
are
all
that
i
really
can
smell
notes
of
orange
wildflowers
and
spicy
herbs
the
beer
is
actually
quite
tasty
with
a
somewhat
light
palate
but
it
is
quite
mouth
coating
it
is
a
nicely
hoppy
beer
with
notes
of
citrus
and
pine
plus
a
sharply
bitter
finish
that
has
a
certain
hoppy
astringency
to
it
this
is
quite
a
nice
hoppy
pale
ale
ipa
hops
for
the
holiday
i
certainly
like
this
beer
though
it
is
certainly
nothing
like
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
it
is
quite
simplistic
in
its
hoppiness
no
real
maltiness
to
back
it
up
but
sometimes
that
hits
the
spot
pours
a
dark
amber
with
little
head
hoppy
floral
aroma
with
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
slightly
sweet
taste
balanced
with
grapefruitty
hops
lingering
hop
aroma
body
was
moderate
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
a
very
smooth
beer
for
its
abv
and
a
drinkable
one
at
that
not
what
id
expect
in
a
winter
warmer
with
qualities
i
associate
more
with
certain
belgian
ales
however
it
falls
short
of
being
more
than
merely
good
pours
amber
with
minimal
head
drops
to
a
wisp
of
bubbles
hoppy
nose
and
slight
sweetness
honey
starts
with
mild
sweetness
which
is
taken
out
by
nice
hop
bittering
grapefruit
and
pineapple
flavors
with
just
a
hint
of
cinammon
the
bittering
is
intense
on
the
finish
which
also
welcomes
a
pronounced
alcohol
warming
very
long
bitter
finish
not
traditional
winter
warmer
but
a
northwest
hop
oriented
warmer
nice
overall
a
solid
seasonal
ipa
the
beer
as
it
disembogues
from
the
bottle
a
deep
translucent
copper
color
with
a
prodigious
sized
frothy
and
a
off
white
head
as
it
dissipates
the
lace
forms
a
thick
and
concealing
sheet
to
obscure
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
nice
hop
floral
crispness
at
the
front
the
middle
sweet
malt
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
and
start
is
sweet
and
has
a
nice
malt
profile
with
the
top
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
benignly
carbonated
the
hop
spiciness
quite
pronounced

is
desert
dry
and
long
lasting
with
a
bit
of
a
tummy
warming
from
the
7
5
percent
abv
if
theres
a
problem
with
this
beer
it
seems
a
bit
thin
body
wise
but
nonetheless
a
fine
drinking
beer
and
a
great
brewery
that
produces
a
fine
line
of
beers
overall
notes

a

though
too
sweet
for
me
overall
a
nice
and
pleasant
christmas
beer
spices
seem
well
balanced
and
an
interesting
selection
at
that
while
spiced
beers
arent
my
everyday
cup
of
tea
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
annually
over
the
holiday
season
a
very
good
holiday
ale
you
can
definitely
taste
the
cinnamon
ginger
and
spices
the
beer
is
moderately
malty
the
aroma
is
very
weak
though
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
there
are
better
warmers
out
there
a
real
winter
warmer
here
and
an
annual
favorite
bottle
pour
kicks
up
a
nice
off
white
head
with
clinging
lace
deep
copperorange
in
color
with
a
slight
unfiltered
look
the
nose
is
ginger
orange
peel
and
christmas
candles
taste
wise
the
nose
sits
true
with
a
dash
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
a
dollop
of
honey
maybe
a
tad
more
here
than
previous
years
which
have
had
a
little
more
heat
quite
a
heavy
mouthfeel
which
has
a
thick
throat
covering
sensation
which
seems
to
come
from
the
honey
this
is
a
satisfying
festive
ale
with
pronounced
spices
this
is
the
first
christmas
ale
ive
tried
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
with
but
i
thought
it
was
a
really
good
beer
one
of
my
favorite
xmas
ales
o
my
only
problem
is
the
sour
elements
almost
eclipse
the
spice
and
sweet
malts
rather
than
complimenting
the
bread
and
spice
it
tugs
against
it
leaving
me
wishing
i
could
dial
down
this
element
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fizzes
away
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
full
of
sweet
aromas
such
as
vanilla
and
sugar
the
taste
was
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
with
some
of
the
vanilla
and
caramel
but
then
balances
with
some
spice
that
makes
it
much
more
drinkable
there
was
a
bit
of
a
creamy
aftertaste
which
was
very
nice
as
well
very
bitter
doesnt
leave
a
nice
after
taste
either
friends
and
family
like
it
but
im
not
a
fan
not
a
fan
of
the
spice
this
was
my
favorite
christmas
winter
warmer
for
the
2014
season
just
the
right
amount
of
spices
but
not
too
overbearing
ive
enjoyed
the
gl
xmas
ale
in
this
past
however
this
year
i
was
disappointed
it
overall
felt
very
heavy
too
dark
and
was
not
as
enjoyable
to
drink
as
it
has
been
in
previous
years
a
nice
pleasing
xmas
ale
but
a
little
too
much
nutmegclove
for
my
taste
otherwise
a
very
pretty
beer
with
a
pleasing
nose
holiday
appropriate
and
is
relatively
easy
drinking
o
a
pretty
good
beer
easy
to
drink
but
not
an
overwhelming
beer
overall
solid
christmas
beer
nice
amount
of
christmas
flavor
going
on
here
not
bad
a
little
sweet
this
stuff
is
good
for
a
beer
or
2
dont
buy
a
12
pack
and
think
you
will
enjoy
the
whole
pack
overall
hot
damn
wow
and
holy
crap
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
ive
ever
had
i
wish
i
could
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
a
brew
like
this
highlights
the
fact
that
during
the
fall
people
dont
like
pumpkin
they
like
pumpkin
spice
this
beer
has
almost
the
exact
same
flavor
profile
as
most
pumpkin
beers
albeit
with
a
much
smoother
and
sweeter
malt
base
and
obviously
no
pumpkin

great
christmas

not

not

great
taste
great
way
to
make
a
terrible
holiday
party
easier
to
enjoy
pours
a
clear
amber
with
reddish
hues
and
a
small
khaki
head
that
faded
to
nothing
and
didnt
leave
any
lacing
i
didnt
see
it
mentioned
but
mine
had
some
noticeable
sediment
floating
aromas
of
honey
caramel
cherry
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
taste
hits
up
front
with
caramel
and
light
cherry
flavor
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
spices
hit
mid
palate
and
it
finishes
with
an
earthy
hop
bite
woven
with
some
honey
cherry
and
spice
notes
thin
end
of
medium
body
sharp
carbonation
bit
of
spice
laden
finish
that
lingers
and
tastes
off
overall
one
of
the
better
christmas
ales
ive
had
it
could
use
a
touch
less
spice
and
a
clean
up
on
the
finish
not
a
fan
of
this
one
at
all
it
smells
tastes
like
something
from
sam
adams
but
worse
great
lakes
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
i
think
they
dropped
the
ball
on
this
one
an
excellent
locally
brewed
seasonal
beer
from
great
lakes
brewing
co
great
taste
and
readily
available
a
much
better
version
of
petes
wicked
winter
did
a
holiday
beer
tasting
with
the
wife
you
can
smell
the
spices
on
this
one
doesnt
really
smell
like
a
winter
warmer
to
me
the
taste
is
sweet
and
chewy
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
my
wife
loves
it
though
almost
buttery
sweetness
if
that
makes
sense
great
seasonal
beer
a
good
six
pack
of
goto
beers
o
3
75
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
tastes
more
like
a
spiced
lager
to
me
the
taste
is
sweet
and
nice
very
rich
malty
backbone
there
is
a
low
hop
level
none
detectable
i
would
drink
another
but
if
i
am
buying
i
would
get
something
different
the
honey
sweetness
was
not
my
thing
i
love
this
beer
it
is
a
christmas
treat
like
a
nottoosweet
spiced
cake
thats
perfect
for
kicking
back
watching
some
tv
and
just
relaxing
overall
the
beer
feels
like
a
lower
abv
version
of
mad
elf
which
isnt
necessarily
bad
the
sweetness
definitely
makes
me
think
of
christmas
and
the
honey
is
pretty
good
however
i
cant
really
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
a
day
despite
this
i
think
that
this
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
getting
i
can
certainly
see
what
great
lakes
was
going
for
a
beer
reminiscent
of
red
christmas
ornaments
and
they
definitely
succeeded
i
would
definitely
recommend
getting
a
sixpack
of
this
i
wouldnt
recommend
finishing
it
in
one
session
copper
color
bready
and
malty
nose
the
seasonal
spices
merge
well
with
the
malt
base
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
sweet
and
the
potent
essence
of
cinnamon
at
fridge
temps
its
refreshing
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
very
subtle
spice
vibe
in
the
background
as
it
warms
up
a
little
it
really
opens
up
the
bitterness
all
but
disappears
and
a
nice
gingerbread
spice
flavor
takes
center
stage
its
a
tasty
interesting
sipper
o
a
top

winter
warmer
that
is
packed
with
flavor
while
remaining

drinkable

45
easily
the
most
overrated
craft
beer
in
my
opinion
while
its
not
bad
i
am
totally
at
a
loss
as
to
why
the
hype
machine
gets
fired
up
the
way
it
does
over
this
beer
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
one
thing
that
stands
out
as
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
i
suppose
its
less
about
how
bad
this
beer
is
and
more
about
how
many
other
amazing
christmas
ales
and
craft
beers
are
out
there
bought
some
of
this
at
local
kroger
store
yes
grocery
store
to
try
not
bad
basic
winter
style
beer
tastes
good
great
ruby
redrust
color
but
surprisingly
no
aroma
but
again
good
drinking
beer
and
seasonal
great

does
a
superb
job
in
crafting
this
christmas
ale
has
the
right
spice
notes
without
being
overpowering
i
enjoyed
this
brew
mightily
very
clean
and
delicious
for
a
cold
night
not
as
good
this
year
the
bottles
i
purchased
all
had
an
off
flavor
not
good
at
all
and
not
the
same
as
previous
years
on
tap
was
better
but
still
not
good
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
spiced
beers
however
this
one
is
tastefully
spiced
punintended
everything
was
executed
well
a
warming
welcome
to
the
hectic
holiday
season
ginger
and
lots
of
it
if
you
used
to
like
great
lakes
christmas
ale
and
think
it
just
isnt
what
you
remembered

is
a
very
drinkable
beverage
and
i
highly
recommend
it
it
isnt
too
sharply
spiced
as
some
but
not
cloudy
still
smells
of
cinnamon
and
spices
they
were
a
little
hidden
in
fresher
bottles
i
think
it
is
easier
to
drink
with
a
little
maturity
much
smoother
with
plenty
of
suspended
floaties
the
aroma
is
spicy
2004
im
not
sure
if
that
was
when
it
was
brewed
or
if
it
is
best
before
that
date
seems
a
little
early
if
that
is
the
case
i
wouldnt
really
bother
cellaring
this
beer
spciy
flavor
of
sweet
malt
and
spice
other
fruits
clove
with
the
caramel
playing
more
of
a

role
in

there
were
hints
of
a

in
there

the

the

is
also
packed
with

you
can
bet
that
ill
be
getting
more
of
this

during

i
had
such

the
taste
and

were
just
not

i
wish
i
could
taste
even

generally
like

dont

kickinthebackofthethroat

when
it
is

with
something
else
this
one
is
a

bummer
the
draft
i
had
was

taste
was
too
mild
with
some

not

im
extremely
open
minded
when
it
comes
to
all

99

of
what
i
try
that
im
not
a
fan
of
i
can
at
least
find
something
positive
to
say
about
it
and
i
usually
end
on
an
i
wont
buy
it
again
but
id
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
to
me
type
of
note
not
fireside
chat
i
will
never
drink
this
shat
again
its
just
not
good
im
not
trying
to
be
a
jerk
it
is
just
a
sincerely
bad
product
o
this
was
neither
refreshing
nor
could
it
possibly
perpetuate
any
fireside
chat
maybe
i
should
smoke
a
cigarette
like
the
guy
on
the
can
to
add
some
flavor
sorry
for
the
diatribe
i
often
find
myself
liking
most
of
the
new
beers
i
try
this
one
would
be
a
drain
pour
if
i
wasnt
committed
to
writing
this
review
based
on
a
fully
drunken
beer
to
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
that
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
it
doesnt
overall
an
ok
winter
warmer
but
not
my
favorite
dark
brown
body
with
a
tan
head
smells
almost
like
a
gingerbread
nut
brown
taste
is
nutmeg
cinnamon
gingerbread
with
a
light

overall
this
is

really

a

great
beer
well
rounded
albeit
a
stronger

than
i
was

done
just
about
right
keep
up
the
good
work
enjoyed
by

very
complex
malt
flavors
including
coffee
slight
smoke
nut
but
not
as
bold
as
it
looks
slight
burnt
nose
and
after
taste
which
isnt
overpowering
overall
a
good
winter
beer
holiday
ale
featuring
holiday
spice
molasses
candied
fruit
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
heat
a
nice
brew
for
the
holiday
season
this
is
good
nice
holiday
brew
not
overly
spiced
but
smooth
and
balanced
nothing
over
the
top
but
id
definitely
have
another
i
would
also
say
that
this
brew
is
named
accordingly
its
a
great
brew
to
pour
for
yourself
and
a
friend
and
sit
down
next
to
the
fire
catch
up
with
one
another
and
talk
about
the
old
times
while
sipping
it
slowly
if
my
buddy
ever
offers
me
another
i
most
certainly
will
not
reject
it
but
i
dont
think
this
one
will
ever
make
its
way
into
my
fridge
taste
i
struggled
to
figure
this
one
out
it
has
spices
that
tend
to
build
up
in
the
back
of
your
throat
extremely
complex
each
sip
brings
different
notes
slight
bitterness
but
not
overpowering
i
did
not
enjoy
it
at
all
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
red
not
much
going
on
the
nose
taste
is
good
spices
and
more
spices
almost
reminds
me
of
a
pumpkin

are

with

quality
almost
light
medium

with
a
bit
of
smooth
texture
slightly
below
normal
carbonation
with
little
effervescence
in
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
somewhat
intense
quite
complex
and
very
well
balanced
it
begins
with
a
wisp
of
fig
that
flows
into
a
light
sweet
molasses
with
a
burnt
character
in
the
middle
these
yield
to
the
spices
that
impart
a
mild
spicy
bitterness
the
finish
is
a
slow
fade
of
bitterness
to
caramel
sweetness
as
the
sweetness
fades
a
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
lingers
of
ginger
over
light
cinnamon
the

is
totally

poured
a
deep
clear
brown
with
light
tan
head
that
mostly
burns
off
with
just
a
little
holding
on
in
the
center
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
lightly
spiced
and
dark
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
more
robust
with
some
distinct
cardamom
it
has
a
lighter
body
and
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
pretty
good
the

is
very
deceiving
sitting
around

chocolaty

a
deep
chocolate
brown

21st

fireside
chat
gives
off
an
aroma
of
nutmeg
clove
and
allspice
the
somewhat
coffeegingerbread
like
smell
is
slightly
bitter
but
malty
with
hints
of
molasses
as
noses
go
it
isnt
that
complex
it
starts
off
sweet
but
moves
toward
the
the
bitter
side
of
the
spectrum
despite
this
its
balanced
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
with
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
balanced
and
doesnt
actually
feel
as
heavy
as
it
looks
the
flavors
are
of
nutmeg
clove
smoke
espresso
and
touch
of
fruitness
the
malt
is
also
strong
giving
off
flavors
of
burnt
caramel
molasses
and
burned
sugars
the
finish
channels
a
lot
of
the
espresso
and
earthiness
and
finishes
somewhat
like
dark
chocolate
on
the
palate
enjoyed
from
a
growler
in
a
snifter
this
interesting
winter
ale
pours
a
brownish
red
with
a
thin
tanoff
white
head
and
nice
lacing
nose
of
chocolate
cinnamon
sweet
malts
of
brown
sugar
toast
and
some
allspice
flavors
follow
the
nose
with
a
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
flavor
hitting
up
front
and
a
light
allspice
flavor
knocking
on
the
back
malt
gives
this
spiced
ale
some
good
balance
although
at
times
the
cinnamon
is
a
bit
heavy
handed
nice
mouth
feel
very
smooth
yet
coating
with
a
light
bitter
aftertaste
from
spices
a
solid
winter
ale
improves
greatly
as
it
warms
with
other
flavors
coming
through
nicely
some
orange
and
almost
a
gingerbread
cookie
like
taste
very
interesting
bold
and
different
t
cinnamon
dusted
truffle
but
not
nearly
as
decadent
theres
a
roasted
chocolate
finish
burnt
marshmallow
so
this
beer
kinda
tastes
like
a
smore
which
means
id
actually
like
this
more
in
the
summer
i
got
myself
into
trouble
drinking
pints
of
this
at
a
pub
not
knowing
how
strong
it
is
on
the
alcohol
because
it
never
shows
it
a
few
of
these
and
i
was
real
loose
which
is
always
fun
dark
brown
it
looks
like
a
porter
but
the
roast
on
the
grain
is
only
medium
and
there
is
very
little
bitterness
what
bitterness
is
in
here
is
balanced
out
by
a
brown
sugary
middle
and
a
drying
spicy
finish
that
may
include
anise
and
clove
a
darker
take
on
the
winter
warmer
its
rich
and
satisfying
in
the
feel
very
full
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
surprised
how
drinkable
it
is
which
is
how
i
got
wasted
on
it
in
the
first
place
i
have
liked
all
the
beer
i
have
had
from
these
guys
cool
they
have
wider
distribution
now
not
my
favorite
here
but
is
think
it
is
underrated
ultimately
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
one
im
likely
going
to
reach
for
again
o
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
who
is
expecting
ok
from
a
winter
warmer
the
muddyness
and
out
of
context
spice
diminishes
the
drinkability
if
you
order
this
beer
you
will
still
enjoy
your
meal
but
it
would
be
nice
if
21st
amendment
cleans
it
up
its
just
not
really
a
beer
anymore
that
strohs
is
its
a
product
contact
them
you
can
have
your
own
brew
made
there
they
do
if
for
many
you
can
really
taste
the
chocolate
and
toffee
taste
it
definitely
has
some
spiced
notes
while
drinking
it
really
enjoyed
this
brown
ale
and
would
have
this
again
for
sure
kinda
sweet
and
flat
malt
taste
tings
the
tongue
nice
malts
provide
just
enough
backbone
with
a
toasty
chocolate
character
that
is
nevertheless
subdued
hint
of
bubblegum
and
just
maybe
a
hint
of
marshmallow
i
bet
this
would
be
great
fireside
o
could
use
a
little
sweetness
as
the
spices
take
over
even
with
the
big
maltiness
alcohol
starts
to
interfere
as
it
warms
up
as
well
a
good
sipper
as
long
as
it
doesnt
warm
up
too
much
which
kind
of
detracts
from
that
point
interesting
to
say
the
least
overall
probably
not
one
ill
try
again
just
feels
like
it
starts
to
go
in
so
many
directions
but
doesnt
follow
through
on
any
of
them
does
it
want
to
be
a
doppelbock
eisbock
porter
belgian
strong
dark
not
terrible
by
any
means
just
seems
a
little
disjointed
84100
certainly
better
than
harpoons
winter
warmer
this
one
almost
suffers
from
the
opposite
problem
not
quite
enough
spices
to
it
its
there
but
could
use
a
little
bit
more
oomph
still
i
prefer
the
more
lightly
spiced
option
this
is
a
tasty
substantial
brown
ale
for
winter
it
tastes
distinctly
warm
but
if
i
didnt
know
there
were
spices
i
might
not
notice
them
certainly
cant
identify
them
a
little
too
easydrinking
for
something
thats
almost
8
abv
nice
to
find
something
new
that
isnt
overwhelmingly
hoppy
against
style
dark
and
lovely
to
be
frank
i
expectedcould
have
used
more
spice
cheers
too
bitter
for
me

i
would

with

for
a

beer
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
with
a
mild
carbonation
that
i
feel
really
suits
the
style
overall
this
is
the
first
beer
in
the
winter
warmer
category
i
have
ever
tried
and
i
will
be
returning
a
very
smooth
spiced
beer
that
wont
overpower
o

this
is
a
new
variety
and
taste
to
me
it
was
not
like
any
beer
i
have
had
it
is
not
bad
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
the
nose
was
a
tad
weak
and
i
couldnt
pick
out
individual
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
i
feel
like
it
is
tasting
more
like
a
scotch
ale
with
spices
overall
wow
another
great
beer
from
21st
amendment
tons
of
malt
stone
fruit
and
spices
delicious
while
the
ale
simmers
in

glass
like
coffee
theres
a
lot
of
promise
in
its
taste
allowing
the
spices
to
join
the
process
in
more
postfermentation
usage
would
have
retained
the
delicate
oils
from
the
spices
and
without
leaching
its
brash
tannin
enjoyable
especially
in
front
of
the
crackling
fire
for
a
winter
warmer
o
im
not
super
impressed
buy
it
but
its
fairly
decent
and
above
average
for
the
price
point
ill
probably
get
it

is

also

absolutely
a

mouth
feel

grand
and
easy
at
the

carbonated
well
a

of
mediocre
scores
here
but
this
is
just
a
great
beer
for
me
invokes
christmases
past
o
not
a
bad
offering
but
id
be
lying
if
i
said
this
is
anything
more
than
just
okay
overall
interesting
enjoyable
but
not
particularly
surprising
or
delicious
o
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
style
that
is
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
cold
winters
night
can
easily
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
during
the
winter
time
on
a
snowy
night
or
day
for
that
matter
hop
character
should
be
weaker
for
the
balance
but
good
spice
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
it
doesnt
bog
down
and
leaves
just
a
little
residue
d
this
is
a
really
nice
winter
seasonal
and
probably
my
favorite
from
this
otherwise
underwhelming
brewery
well
balanced
with
a
great
mouth
feel
and
some
nice
spiced
chocolate
flavors
worth
revisiting
hit
or
miss
some
years
i
think
its
good
others
not
so
much
its
really
just
an
average
warmer
overall
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
opaque
sediment
filled
chestnut
coloring
with
amber
highlights
and
a
dense
creamy
half
inch
of
cream
colored
head
that
slowly
settles
into
a
filmy
surface
coat
aromas
of
ginger
roast
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
pine
tassel
candied
sugar
bread
and
booze
dynamic
and
layered
nose
flavors
are
heavy
and
roasted
forward
with
a
blast
of
caramel
dark
blended
with
an
array
of
holiday
spices
such
as
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
initial
burst
of
flavor
lightens
rapidly
and
there
is
a
solid
spice
component
that
remains
slightly
overpowering
a
light
somewhat
watered
down
body
in
mouth
with
a
solid
spice
linger
into
the
aftertaste
giving
a
feel
of
warm
cinnamon
and
cider
that
shifts
to
a
tangy
sweetness
that
is
cloying
through
to
the
finish
with
a
slightly
astringent
feel
as
well
this
one
has
its
ups
and
downs
tasty
but
could
be
tightened
up
in
a
couple
of
spots
final
thoughts
definitely
not
the
beer
i
was
expecting
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
there
but
its
very
spastic
and
unrefined
i
like
my
winter
warmers
to
be
smooth
and
rich
fireside
chat
did
not
deliver
would
i
drink
it
again
no
overall
a
minor
player
in
such
a
broad
category
t
starts
very
nut
brown
aleish
with
sweeter
nutty
roasted
malt
tones
upfront
then
some
baking
spices
flare
up
and
youre
left
with
an
aftertaste
that
is
kind
of
like
that
bitter
flavor
you
get
when
you
try
the
cinnamon
challenge
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
thing
o
great
beer
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
this
pretty
color
other
than
that
nothing
nice
about
it
for
me
maybe
a
bad
batch
still
at
11
a
six
pack
im
not
giving
it
another
shot
m
creamy
medium
bodied
and
fairly
drinkable
considering
the
abv
pretty
nice
for
the
winter
o
a
little
bit
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
also
depending
on
the
person
the
spice
might
be
overbearing
not
really
something
i
see
myself
going
back
to
buy
again
and
for
the
record
i
would
much
rather
drink
chinotto
over
this
overall
a
solid
winter
beer
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
better
than
the
average
rating
its
getting
not
spectacular
but
still
pretty
decent
a
bit
bittersweet
for
me
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
would
have
again
recommended
christmas
pudding
of
a
beer
plums
damsons
and
rich
spices
filled
the
nose
and
mouth
i
really
enjoyed
it
full
of
flavour
warming
and
wintery
in
nature
a
smoking
jacket
sort
of
beer
impressed
one
of
my
favorite
spiced
winter
beers
and
it
comes
from
a
place
that
doesnt
even
have
a
winter
san
francisco
it
is
a
dark
englishstyle
ale
spiced
with
cinnamon
and
other
spices
common
in
winter
ales
i
find
it
to
be
a
great
mix
between
a
malty
english
ale
and
a
spiced
americanstyle
winter
ale
a
great
beer
d
not
bad
the
spice
aroma
is
still
pungent
even
though
this
can
has
some
age
on
it
and
it
is
a
bit
unique
compared
to
many
other
spiced
beers
ive
tried
a
fairly
well
handled
example
of
a
spiced
beer
single
finger
head
with
poor
retention
but
nice
lace
on
a
near
clear
deep
amber
red
body
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
well
represented
with
nutmeg
cherry
mint
and
cinnamon
all
spice
really
flavors
of
the
winter
season
with
more
nutmeg
gingerbread
nutmeg
and
hint
of
peppermint
some
caramel
malt
base
as
well
a
lot
thicker
than
expected
moderate
carbonation
and
fairly
oily
coating
the
palate
very
interesting
with
this
one
managing
to
have
many
of
the
same
flavors
as
others
in
the
class
but
the
overall
flavors
and
body
make
it
different
and
therefore
memorable
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
the
true
winteriness
and
warmth
of
the
spice
and
depth
of
malts
while
we
do
wish
things
had
fleshed
out
a
bit
more
fully
through
the
flavoring
each
component
was
nicely
contributory
to
the
final
sip
adding
nice
depth
and
excitement
throughout
the
nose
gave
big
fruity
sweetness
and
smelled
a
bit
more
like
a
bock
at
times
than
a
warmer
mouthfeel
also
ultimately
added
to
the
experience
helping
to
keep
you
happy
with
almost
every
sip
overall
i
like
this
it
might
come
off
to
some
as
being
a
bit
heavy
handed
with
the
ginger
and
spices
to
some
but
it
works
pretty
well
for
me
all
in
all
enjoyable
however
i
feel
it
is
slightly
too
bitter
for
the
style
still
i
will
continue
to
purchase
and
enjoy
this
beer
overall
wasnt
exactly
thrilled
going
into
this
but
over
time
i
did
enjoy
it
as
it
went
down
it
brought
some
surprises
to
the
plate
but
there
are
in
need
of
some
improvements
some
of
the
spices
added
in
were
generic
and
not
very
different
from
the
norm
not
to
say
this
wasnt
a
good
beer
as
it
was
good
for
sipping
but
nothing
entirely
too
special
i
would
maybe
try
again
if
it
were
offered
but
i
guess
i
would
recommend
to
a
friend
cheers
overall
not
really
one
i
would
recommend
the
flavors
are
a
little
too
spicy
and
astringent
with
a
feel
that
does
not
complement
well
the
winter
warmer
category
although
i
guess
the
boozy
taste
does
o
solid
beer
but
the
finish
on
the
swallow
really
ruins
it
glad
i
only
got
the
one
overall
its
not
bad
and
if
the
aftertaste
was
cleaner
and
the
flavors
played
better
it
would
get
higher
marks
up
until
that
point
it
was
a
solid
b
it
pours
a
opaque
black
with
no
particles
evident
in
the
beer
it
smells
sweet
like
vanilla
and
maybe
ginger
or
some
other
spice
i
feel
that
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
welcomed
i
love
the
spices
of
this
beer
it
has
a
warming
very
pleasant
taste
of
vanilla
and
then
fades
to
the
other
spices
as
well
as
to
the
malts
of
this
beer
which
are
rich
i
taste
lots
of
sweet
tastes
which
escape
me
but
i
definitely
get
vanilla
i
like
this
beer
and
would
order
it
again
especially
if
on
tap
overall
a
nice
winter
warmer
a
little
long
on
the
sweet
flavors
overall
this
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
i
dont
know
that
i
could
drink
more
than
a
can
at
a
time
but
its
certainly
festive
and
a
beer
i
might
turn
to
for
a
oneoff
night
cap
on
a
day
like
christmas
eve
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
by
21st
amendment
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
christmas
ales
but
would
drink
this
again
just
wouldnt
seek
it
out
the
spice
disguises
any
alcohol
that
would
be
detected
give
it
a
shot
good
not
bad
not
great
onot
a
bad
beer
has
decent
flavor
profile
and
appearance
not
a
staple
for
my
holiday
season
but
might
grab
it
once
in
awhile
overall
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
but
too
heavy
on
the
spices
for
my
tastes
a
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
i
feel
like
21st
amendment
tried
to
find
the
most
spices
they
could
possibly
put
in
a
beer
and
do
that
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
way
overpowering
this
was
an
interesting
beer
i
enjoyed
the
aroma
and
taste
but
overall
the
holidayspice
notes
became
a
bit
much
towards
the
middle
of
the
glass
overall
a
pretty
different
take
on
a
winter
warmer
very
heavily
spiced
and
a
nice
fruity
malt
mix
pretty
decent
overall
o
if
you
like
very
spicy
winter
warners
youd
probably
really
enjoy
this
not
particuarly
my
style
too
much
spice
for
me
oits
more
or
less
just
a
mess
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
here
but
they
just
dont
mix
together
well
i
think
some
of
the
spices
need
to
be
taken
out
it
definitely
does
have
some
sort
of
potential
but
it
needs
work
not
exactly
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
certain
plasticlike
bitterness
that
makes
this
not
exactly
fun
to
finish
i
dont
recommend
theres
something
better
out
there
for
you
to
choose
o
not
a
bad
winter
style
ale
spice
flavoring
is
on
the
heavy
side
could
use
more
malt
for
balance
i
honestly
dont
see
what
this
was
supposed
to
taste
like
with
a
final
product
this
messy
maybe
it
was
supposed
to
be
consumed
fresher
but
it
seems
im
not
the
only
one
recently
whos
only
been
able
to
find
a
batch
this
old
i
like
peppermint
and
dark
fruit
flavor
they
aimed
for
here
but
the
metallic
blackcurrant
aftertaste
really
is
too
much
for
me
especially
because
i
suspect
it
wasnt
supposed
to
end
up
like
this
drain
pour
i
like
this
as
a
winter
beer
but
would
have
it
only
on
occasion
its
quite
intenseflavored
this
is
my
opinionm
but
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
will
have
it
again
overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
occasionally
ill
enjoy
a
winter
warmer
this
is
by
far
the
best
example
i
have
tried
somewhere
between
malty
and
hoppy
this
beer
truly
warms
with
a
comforting
array
of
christmaslike
spices
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
spiced
beers
but
this
one
does
it
pretty
well
o
im
disappointed
in
tasting
the
aluminum
can
with
this
beer
maybe
i
should
blame
myself
for
not
looking
for
a
date
or
maybe
fireside
chat
should
just
be
bottled
nonetheless
i
believe
the
beer
isnt
much
anyway
nothing
really
struck
me
as
special
in
the
end
its
bark
presentation
appearance
smell
was
definitely
more
appealing
than
its
bite
maybe
i
need
to
try
this
on
draft
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
just
an
okay
beer
the
flavors
are
all
over
the
palate
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
solid
malt
foundation
and
more
uniformed
in
flavor
good
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
o
very
good
beer
will
have
again
surprised
that
it
didnt
get
better
reviews
i
enjoyed
it
the
color
when
poured
was
dark
brown
with
a
little
amount
of
tan
foam
and
a
load
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
spices
and
fruit
along
with
yeasty
roasted
malts
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
had
a
sweetbitter
alcoholic
spicy
flavor
with
a
hint
of
roasted
yeasty
breadfruit
flavor
a
little
bitter
finish
but
a
loads
of
spicyfruity
flavor
on
the
palate
this
is
another
winner
for
21st
amendment
nicely
balanced
flavor
o
not
a
good
beer
m
more
fullbodied
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
still
mediumbodied
its
nice
pretty
clean
finish
dark

with
thin

pretty
stanky

medicinal

cinnamon
light

bready
some
vanilla

and
mild

medium

with
medium
carbonation
pretty
bubbly
for
a
winter
warmer
good
for
2
at
most
overall
im
not
all
that
familiar
with
winter
warmers
or
englishstyle
ales
but
based
on
the
descriptions
ive
read
this
one
is
pretty
much
to
style
i
do
wish
that
there
had
been
a
more
pronounced
spice
profile
to
this
one
but
all
things
considered
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
at
7
9
abv
a
few
pints
will
definetly
fulfill
the
warming
side
of
the
equation
rich
creamy
body
with
a
fluffy
mouthfeel
flavors
are
a
lot
like
that
of
the
nose
but
while
the
banana
nut
bread
flavors
come
through
stronger
on
the
nose
the
cinnamon
raisin
bread
like
flavors
come
through
stronger
on
the
tongue
dry
and
spicy
on
the
back
end
of
the
tongue
with
a
mild
alcohol
warming
finish
in
my
opinion
an
awesome
brew
for
cold
winter
morning
with
breakfast
or
cold
winter
nights
sitting
by
the
fire
enjoying
some
sweets
and
of
course
good
conversation
a
really
good
brew
and
oddly
i
think
it
drinks
better
out
of
the
can
than
in
a
glass
found
this
lone
can
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
and
realized
never
got
to
review
it
so
here
goes
lucky
for
me
it
should
be
rolling
out
for
production

soon

very

the
balance
is
pretty
good
but
it
feel
just
a
touch
off
the
spices
are
a
bit
too
rough
compared
to
the
rest
of

i
love
this

its

great
job
21
amendment
o
i
nursed
this
brew
for
about
an
hour
while
chatting
with
friends
theres
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
and
was
a
nice
change
from
my
typical
ipas
or
stouts
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
chewy
with
a
medium
to
heavy
body
a
slick
feel
and
mild
carbonation
this
slides
down
easy
and
hides
the
abv
well
in
the
flavor
but
it
was
just
too
scattered
like
the
whole
spice
cabinet
had
a
dash
added
had
this
on
tap
and
now
out
of
the
can
and
wasnt
really
a
fan
on
either
occasion
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
ultimately
enjoyable
but
lackluster
all
the
same
the
flavor
is
mild
and
simplistic
with
little
to
separate
it
from
the
rest
of
the
winter
warmer
field
i
probably
wont
go
for
this
again
i
found
this
beer
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
im
glad
i
ran
across
this
can
overall
another
impressive
21st
amendment
brew
this
one
was
made
under
contract
locally
at
the
cold
springs
brewery
in
minnesota
i
am
really
liking
these
canned
beer
offerings
from
21st
amendment
d
flavorful
but
not
very
tasty
since
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
mesh
well
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
again
o
a
good
winter
warmer
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
would
buy
this
again
o
overall
a
nice
inexpensive
example
of
the
winter
warmer
style
a
good
choice
for
those
looking
for
a
winter
on
the
maltier
side
or
those
who
like
quite
a
bit
of
spices
overall
this
seems
above
average
for
the
style
spiced
winter
ales
are
rarely
all
that
interesting
with
a
few
notable
exceptions
this
one
is
pretty
well
done
and
id
buy
it
again
if
the
mood
struck
me
sidebar
love
the
packaging
like
fdrs
radio
addresses
this
beer
is
like
a
kick
in
the
butt
and
a
hug
at
the
same
time
overall
charming
festive
and
warming
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
and
minimal
headlacing
this
smells
like
spicenutmeg
and
cinnamonand
some
sweet
dried
fruits
like
figs
and
plums
the
taste
has
both
of
those
components
some
toasted
malt
and
citric
hops
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
spices
its
a
pretty
solid
beer
with
a
pleasantly
light
and
clean
bodyi
really
like
the
dry
ending
since
i
find
some
winter
warmers
very
sticky
and
unintegrated
its
a
pretty
good
beer
and
my
mother
loved
it
so
ill
probably
buy
it
again
o
decent
for
the
winter
time
but
id
like
to
see
this
toned
down
on
the
spices
not
very
drinkable
after
the
first
one
the
drinkability
is
moderate
at
best
on
this
as
the
alcohol
snuck
up
on
me
its
a
good
beer
brown
that
is
malty
and
spices
are
mostly
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
pleasant
and
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
above
average
carbonation
brown
with
a
minimal
head
malty
aroma
surprisingly
little
spices
in
nose
caramel
nutty
a
spiced
up
brown
would
like
more
hops
ok
nothing
special
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
easy
to
drink
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
the
aftertaste
has
a
confused
mixture
of
spices
and
dark
roasted
malt
which
do
not
work
together
whoever
thought
beer
this
was
a
good
idea
was
sadly
mistaken
thankfully
i
picked
this
can
up
as
a
single
so
i
never
have
to
try
it
again
pours
a
dark
burgundy
brown
color
minimal
head
and
lacing
scent
is
mild
and
contains
roasted
nuts
toasted
grain
hint
of
char
minimal
traces
of
caramel
and
seasonal
spice
splash
of
cranberry
juice
taste
is
quite
light
and
muddled
malts
are
roasty
and
toasty
but
light
seasonal
spices
are
a
focal
point
but
light
splash
of
tart
cranberry
juice
medium
bodied
and
bubbly
overall
not
much
going
on
and
that
makes
it
unmemorable
i
dug
their
monks
blood
a
bit
more
it
being
spiced
as
well
but
im
happy
to
see
more
spiced
beers
around
o
this
beer
has
a
great
look
and
a
nice
aroma
but
the
taste
does
not
deliver
everything
one
expects
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
though
meant
to
balance
actually
takes
away
from
the
beer
as
a
whole
i
also
think
the
beer
could
be
a
bit
heavier
there
is
nice
roasted
malt
and
burnt
edges
but
the
holiday
spices
get
a
little
lost
in
the
background
overall
a
definite
winter
beer
the
high
alcohol
content
is
hidden
very
well
spicy
but
nothing
overpowering
overall
a
tasty
in
my
opinion
winter
warmer
but
could
use
more
aggressive
spice
to
counter
the
hops
drink
on
a
cold
day
with
some
lebkuchen
im
proud
to
make
this
beer
my
50th
review
but
the
mouth
feel
and
metallic
taste
detract
from
what
is
going
on
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
something
id
rush
back
to
try
it
made
me
miss
better
winter
warmers
eg
old
fezziwig
its
well
worth
a
try
o
i
could
drink
this
on
a
cold
day
it
didnt
happen
to
be
cold
on
this
day
even
though
it
is
december
6th
in
central
pa
solid
beer
overall
again
not
a
bad
beer
and
definitely
one
that
i
would
finish
off
that
said
not
an
amazing
brew
by
any
means
and
not
one
that
id
seek
out
overall
a
unique
and
fulfilling
winter
warmer
quite
nice
worth
trying
medium
bodied
with
a
harsh
overly
aggressive
spice
presence
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
into
a
acrid
bone
dry
finish
lots
of
potpourri
spice
with
bark
cinnamon
pepper
ginger
and
clove
which
creates
an
unpleasant
dry
flavor
that
dominates
underneath
there
us
some
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
along
with
a
syrupy
medicinal
character
this
beer
is
overly
spice
but
also
cloyingly
sweet
just
all
over
the
place
and
a
bit
if
a
mess
o
based
on
other
reviews
there
may
be
some
bottle
variation
going
on
here
and
unfortunately
mine
was
not
one
of
the
better
ones
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
potential
but
doesnt
pull
it
together
o
a
go
to
winter
ale
that
will
be
bought
again
definitely
one
to
share
with
the
bros
for
cold
winter
nights
o
very
nice
spiced
beer
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
a
solid
winter
warmer
overall
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
am
surprized
it
is
rated
so
low
it
is
well
balanced
with
a
nice
flavor
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
slightly
off
white
head
which
gives
way
to
strings
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
cinnomon
nutmeg
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
starts
of
with
a
caramel
and
toffee
backbone
that
is
replaced
by
a
cinnomon
and
nutmeg
taste
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
spice
part
in
the
middle
was
very
enjoyable
the
backend
had
an
earthy
hop
bite
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
moderately
carbonated
and
a
touch
creamy
overall
it
was
a
solid
winter
warmer
there
was
a
nice
balance
to
it
and
it
was
very
drinkable
this
is
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
7
9
abv
why
such
the
average
reviews
i
dont
know
the
taste
is
there
and
although
im
a
huge
hophead
this
is
quite
malty
but
the
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
works
quite
well
smooth
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
short
finish
this
is
a
disappointing
offering
from
21st
century
who
have
impressed
me
in
the
past
with
their
other
cans
not
awful
but
pretty
one
dimensional
stay
away
if
you
dont
like
the
spices
because
theyre
here
in
spades
overall
this
beer
sucked
until
it
warmed
up
and
other
flavors
other
then
just
the
spices
came
out
its
a
holiday
beer
only
to
be
drank
for
the
holidays
i
wouldnt
want
this
year
round
but
as
a
session
i
enjoyed
this
o
not
bad
heavier
on
the
sweetness
than
it
strictly
needs
to
be
though
ever
go
to
somebodys
house
and
they
feed
you
something
they
baked
themselves
only
its
not
as
good
as
they
think
it
is
but
you
have
to
be
polite
and
not
say
so
thats
the
vibe
i
get
from
this
beer
overall
not
bad
not
great
overall
fun
to
drink
enjoyable
sipper
definitely
makes
me
think
of
holidays
i
actually
had
this
beer
in
the
can
and
then
later
poured
into
a
glass
and
seriously
put
it
in
a
glass
it
makes
a
huge
difference
you
may
want
to
drink
out
of
the
can
simply
because
of
fdr
on
the
front
but
resist
the
temptation
its
a
nice
winter
beer
malty
and
full
of
flavor
upfront
and
a
huge
spice
punch
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
middle
strangely
though
the
flavor
really
disappears
at
the
end
just
very
little
after
taste
still
its
a
good
beer
and
something
likely
only
around
in
the
winter
o
a
beer
that
feels
like
it
never
reaches
its
full
potential
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
and
makes
me
want
to
reach
for
another
can
the
somewhat
boring
flavors
and
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
one
and
done
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
beer
anytime
soon
overall
pretty
awesome
brew
im
surprise
there
hasnt
been
more
excitement
about
this
seasonal
imagine
anchor
steam
christmas
ale
on
steroids
and
there
you
have
fireside
chat
damn
good
stuff
o
i
hate
to
say
it
but
avoid
this
beer
at
all
costs
ive
enjoyed
offerings
from
21st
amendment
but
i
cannot
fathom
who
passed
putting
this
one
out
well
now
i
need
to
find
something
to
do
with
the
other
5
of
the
pack
mouthfeel
is
slightly
lighter
than
medium
and
has
average
carbonation
overall
just
weird
doesnt
taste
like
anything
that
you
could
normally
find
in
a
winter
warmer
and
honestly
isnt
that
appealing
the
appearance
is
the
best
characteristic
by
far
not
worth
seeking
out
hey
if
you
are
going
for
that
spiced
holiday
ale
you
may
as
well
go
big
or
not
go
at
all
21st
went
big
flailing
away
at
the
tastes
buds
perhaps
not
liquid
gold
but
it
sure
was
fun
to
drink
fun
enough
to
have
more
than
one
as
well
o
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sip
and
savor
the
spices
in
the
smell
and
taste
however
it
could
use
more
body
and
warmth
from
the
alcohol
to
make
it
a
true
winter
warmer
overall
good
but
kind
of
odd
really
comes
off
as
a
winter
spiced
amber
with
a
heavy
dose
of
hops
its
a
good
but
simple
beer
it
does
cover
the
booze
i
will
now
guzzle
not
savor
the
rest
pours
pretty
dark
brown
with
a
good
bit
of
cream
to
tan
colored
head
good
lacing
as
well
definite
spicy
smell
allspice
and
clove
and
cinnamon
notes
with
a
good
backing
of
caramel
and
lightly
roasted
malt
the
flavor
falls
a
bit
flat
though
i
think
the
spice
is
there
but
it
is
kind
of
muddled
in
with
heavy
malts
lots
of
roasted
malt
with
a
bitterness
that
overpowers
or
at
least
warps
the
spice
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
fullbodied
leaving
a
kind
of
sticky
aftertaste
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
more
but
it
didnt
help
me
out
too
much
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
winter
warmer
a
very
independent
brew
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
deep
red
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
not
much
retention
or
lacing
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
of
a
slightly
sweet
profile
with
a
touch
of
spice
on
the
nose
the
taste
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
the
spices
start
to
come
through
a
little
more
making
this
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
heavier
than
i
thought
itd
be
but
not
bad
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
pleasant
beer
nothing
amazing
about
it
but
i
feel
theyre
not
aiming
for
amazing
and
they
have
managed
to
hit
pleasant
n
drinkable
no
this
didnt
really
work
for
me
its
really
flat
and
lifeless
on
the
palate
and
although
there
were
some
pleasant
things
on
the
nose
these
were
ephemeral
and
didnt
really
eventuate
ive
had
better
from
21st
amendment
o
i
wanted
to
like
this
since
im
actually
a
big
fan
of
winter
spices
but
in
the
end
it
was
a
bit
heavyhanded
reign
in
the
spices
and
wed
have
a
real
winner
on
tap
at
21st
amendment
pours
a
mostly
clear
caramelbrown
color
with
a
wellformed
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
is
rather
spicy
and
typical
of
a
winter
warmer
with
sweet
toffee
notes
the
flavor
is
a
little
spice
heavy
but
not
terribly
so
nutmeg
and
allspice
are
most
prominent
this
is
backed
up
by
a
sweet
english
toffee
malt
character
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
with
mediumfull
body
and
only
slight
syrupiness
not
too
much
given
the
abv
slight
alcohol
warmth
i
find
this
one
a
bit
underrated
overall
its
pretty
solid
for
a
winter
warmer
actually
from
notes
121110
can
not
my
favorite
spiced
holiday
ale
but
it
drinks
pretty
easily
and
has
some
interesting
flavor
it
tastes
a
bit
like
spiced
cider
with
oranges
theres
a
lot
of
english
character
in
the
carameltoffee
malt
flavor
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
though
some
of
the
spice
could
be
masking
it
for
me
the
flavor
is
a
bit
odd
but
it
works
at
times
a
fair
bit
of
cola
flavor
hurts
things
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
effervescent
and
thin
for
the
abv
but
not
bad
pours
medium
brown
with
a
thin
fading
head
not
very
happy
with
this
one
21st
amendment
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
there
was
just
way
too
much
spice
in
this
one
almost
as
bad
as
harpoons
winter
warmer
avoid
i
find
this
to
be
a
pleasant
fairly
flavorful
beer
i
could
see
it
drinking
pretty
well
in
the
middle
of
winter
but
the
malts
and
the
spices
seem
like
theyre
battling
with
each
other
and
they
both
come
off
the
worse
for
wear
its
main
downside
is
that
the
parts
dont
come
together
into
a
cohesive
whole
i
have
to
agree
here
with
the
overall
rating
at
least
not
a
tasty
satisfying
or
wellrealized
attempt
at
the
style
or
any
style
fuller
medium
body
higher
carbonation
dry
and
chewy
time
and
time
again
i
really
want
to
like
21st
amendment
but
this
is
plain
awful
i
wont
buy
this
one
again
soured
light
bodied
brew
of
distasteful
delight
dark
burgundy
pour
smallish
head
and
lacing
smell
is
christmas
spices
like
nutmeg
cinnamon
caramel
and
fruit
cake
taste
is
similar
figs
and
plums
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
medium
body
interesting
to
try
but
a
bit
belowaverage
and
nothing
special
all
in
all
this
is
an
interesting
one
i
like
spices
in
my
winter
warmers
but
theres
something
about
this
one
that
just
isnt
quite
right
heavy
spices
funky
almost
artificial
taste
kinda
odd
pours
a
dark
brownish
red
with
a
2
inch
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
foamy
clumps
of
lacing
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
there
is
some
sedimentfloating
debris
in
the
glass
smells
of
dark
fruits
cranberry
winter
spices
cinnamonclove
and
fruitcake
this
actually
smells
very
good
to
me
taste
is
of
fruitcake
with
candied
fruitrinds
cranberry
sauce
and
the
spices
i
mentioned
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
not
as
good
as
the
smell
there
is
almost
a
medicinal
aspect
to
the
taste
beer
has
low
carbonation
and
its
somewhat
hard
to
drink
down
due
to
the
medicine
tastes
i
am
getting
overall
i
had
this
beer
back
in
december
and
it
was
a
lot
better
then
i
think
its
safe
to
say
this
one
has
degraded
over
time
and
is
meant
to
be
consumed
asap
o
overall
i
wasnt
very
impressed
this
beer
from
21st
amendment
the
tart
fruits
mixing
with
the
roasted
malts
just
didnt
work
with
me
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
wow
i
just
dont
know
what
to
think
of
this
its
like
the
makings
of
a
decent
winter
warmer
are
there
but
the
flavors
are
just
so
jumbled
and
confused
at
times
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
get
invested
in
any
way
into
my
glass
of
this
that
tart
fruit
and
spice
combo
were
just
too
much
i
dug
the
experiment
that
is
monks
blood
but
this

decent
beer
for
what
it
is
might
be
better
if
warmed
up
a
bit
like
a
mulled
wine
this
isnt
really
bad
just
not
welcoming
and
inviting
i
may
try
it
again
warm
but
not
chilled
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
beautiful
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
light
tan
head
gets
me
excited
to
try
this
beer
the
smell
is
fairly
subdued
with
mostly
cinnamon
with
some
background
malt
the
taste
is
dominated
by
a
metallic
flavor
that
lingers
with
lactic
sourness
not
good
at
all
im
assuming
that
this
is
infected
so
i
would
try
another
one
next
year
however
right
now
i
certainly
dont
want
another
this
isnt
enjoyable
at
all
though
the
tartness
subsides
the
medicinal
bitterness
picks
up
the
slack
though
it
could
be
worse
i
drainpoured
half
of
it
regardless
the
feel
really
kills
this
one
d
definitely
a
decent
winter
warmer
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
makes
it
seem
bigger
than
it
is
d
after
encouraging
the
eyes
and
nose
to
drink
and
enjoy
this
beer
shocks
the
palate
into
an
invalidated
state
which
renders
the
enjoyment
of
even
humble
food
less
possible
while
many
of
the
flavor
components
are
disagreeable
even
when
taken
alone
the
combination
of
them
clashes
irrevocably
in
short
it
becomes
hard
to
drink
after
a
few
sips
decent
sipper
if
you
like
the
style
overall
it
is
ok
but
i
do
not
know
if
a
winter
warmer
should
be
sour
d
not
strictly
seasonal
as
many
spiced
holiday
beers
are
if
i
had
not
read
the
label
i
would
think
this
just
a
robust
and
complex
brown
heavy
on
the
dark
fruit
aspects
actually
a
pretty
strong
almost
odd
twangy
tart
cherry
thing
going
on
tart
edge
is
enough
to
make
just
wonder
if
it
is
really
intentional
or
a
fault
still
it
is
good
interesting
and
okay
enough
sort
of
reminds
me
of
nbs
frambozen
seems
more
of
a
fall
beer
than
a
winter
one

was

brew
that
hit
me
right
fireside
chat
misses
by
a
country
mile
if
21st
amendment
plans
to
release
this
offering
next
winter
they
need
to
give
it
a
major
overhaul
love
the
label
when
you
see
who
fdr
is
chatting
with
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
brown
was
close
to
being
opaque
one
finger
light
brown
head
that
clung
to
the
sides
extremely
well
aroma
had
a
bit
of
spiciness
to
it
but
also
seemed
to
have
hints
of
pickles
oranges
and
cloves
taste
was
watery
sour
with
slight
spicy
undertones
felt
a
bit
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
not
terribly
pleasing
to
drink
due
to
the
wateriness
and
the
iffy
flavor
notes
for
a
winter
warmer
this
one
is
not
quite
there
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
spice
but
it
simply
was
not
there
cheers
the
flavor
is
roasted
but
in
a
mild
way
with
more
yeast
tanginess
and
the
metallic
flavor
comes
out
with
the
spice
the
taste
is
very
caramel
and
seems
sweet
up
front
but
relaxes
toward
the
middle
more
spice
might
have
been
better
however
the
malt
lacks
a
little
in
the
flavor
dept
i
found
the
off
flavors
easy
to
take
at
first
but
becomes
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
the
winter
warmer
is
ok
but
not
something
i
would
revisit
any
time
soon
purchased
a
can
at
russell
house
tavern
in
harvard
square
on
sunday
for
5
poured
into
a
water
goblet
nice
dark
brown
body
with
a
fuzzy
white
head
some
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
had
a
great
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
aroma
flavor
was
also
very
nice
for
a
winter
warmer
lots
of
spice
some
ripe
fruits
like
fig
and
a
hint
of
smoke
the
beer
looks
thicker
than
it
actually
was
in
reality
the
body
was
on
the
thin
side
but
i
dont
mind
too
much
for
a
canned
beer
for
a
7
9
beer
i
thought
it
was
quite
smooth
i
liked
everything
here
and
id
get
this
beer
again
if
only
due
to
its
relatively
cheap
price
overall
i
suspect
an
infected
can
though
it
was
a
pretty
decent
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
dry
and
astringent
although
the
carbonation
isnt
overdone
however
i
cant
drink
this
at
all
i
therefore
sacrifice
this
beer
to
my
sink
d
not
a
bad
sipper
beer
at
all
the
flavor
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
if
you
drink
too
much
of
it
in
a
short
time
this
was
a
drainpour
d
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
2
of
these
a
lot
of
flavor
but
a
little
goes
a
long
way
so
many
makings
for
a
good
beer
but
im
just
not
that
fond
of
the
spicing
too
heavy
handed
and
not
very
blending
p
s
the
art
is
awesome
fdr
was
the
shit
update
the
more
i
have
the
less
i
like
it
i
did
not
finish
the
six
pack
the
sour
taste
just
gets
more
sour
until
youre
making
that
uggh
yuck
face
and
lose
all
your
desire
to
finish
your
drink
pass
on
this
one
the
palate
manages
to
take
all
the
things
that
are
good
about
the
nose
and
mangle
them
into
something
atrocious
bitter
mace
and
nutmeg
bitter
grainy
astringency
a
little
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
this
is
rather
unpleasant
bitter
almond
skins
are
also
present
paradoxically
this
sweetens
up
on
the
finish
leaving
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
cola
to
go
with
the
bitterness
medium
in
body
with
high
carbonation
this
is
decent
on
the
palate
apart
from
the
finish
unpleasant
im
pouring
the
rest
of
this
out
verdict
not
something
ill
buy
again
or
suggest
to
anyone
d
cant
make
it
through
6
sips
poured
from
can
as
well
as
on
tap
into
a
english
style
glass
a
clear
mahogany
pour
with
a
thick
and
fluffy
khaki
head
a
wonderfully
wintry
roasty
aroma
that
features
some
caramel
toffee
red
apples
pears
plums
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
a
hint
of
anise
more
thin
than
mediumbodied
lots
of
maltiness
upfront
tastewise
some
caramel
and
a
roasty
nuttiness
at
the
forefront
a
biscuity
transition
finishes
kinda
sour
and
dry
with
some
surprising
grassy
notes
plenty
of
spiciness
throughout
some
alcohol
warmth
is
present
a
drinkable
and
pleasant
enough
winter
warmer
d
drinkability
is
low
this
beer
had
promise
and
the
initial
flavor
was
fresh
and
unique
but
it
just
kind
of
falls
apart
i
was
looking
at
my
glass
wishing
it
would
be
gone
sooner
but
i
had
to
wait
a
bit
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
some
cookie
sweetness
up
front
and
some
biscuit
breadiness
in
the
midpalate
leading
to
a
low
bitterness
and
a
clean
finish
im
not
sure
why
this
is
rated
so
low
as
far
as
a
winter
warmer
is
concerned
the
spices
were
not
overwhelming
but
they
were
present
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
fine
id
have
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
this
is
a
great
ale
to
enjoy
during
a
cold
winter
day
or
night

interesting
beer
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
good
lacing
and
head
retention
especially
considering
abv
strong
spice
taste
cant
quite
figure
out
which
spices
it
utilizes
but
theyre
absolutely
overpowering
this
beer
was
ok
to
try
but
im
not
tempted
to
have
another
due
to
the
sweetness
and
poor
balance
of
this
beer
one
is
enough
for
me
i
love
a
good
malty
winter
warmer
but
this
one
goes
overboard
on
the
spices
grade
dc
drinkability
a
nice
blend
of
malt
backbone
and
spices
might
revisit
this
one
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
for
me
fireside
chat
is
more
of
a
nice
change
of
pace
than
something
id
drink
every
day
its
the
only
canned
beer
that
i
currently
look
forward
to
drinking
decent
beer
though
glad
i
tried
it
avoid
weak
offering
drank
the
first
one
out
of
the
can
the
first
sip
was
shockingly
bad
the
spices
aroma
taste
overwhelm
all
the
taste
of
the
beer
2nd
can
into
a
pint
glass
mellowed
the
spice
but
still
terrible
great
color
good
head
but
could
not
get
2
beers
down
save
your
10
d
first
can
i
had
i
thought
was
good
this
can
not
as
must
be
a
different
batch
as
it
was
a
few
months
apart
d
i
was
glad
to
finally
try
a
can
from
21st
and
this
was
a
pretty
nice
one
loved
the
artwork
and
it
was
pretty
tasty
too
edit
as
the
beer
warms
the
sourness
really
dominates
the
flavor
making
it
hard
to
finish
changed
score
to
reflect
that
fireside
chat
had
everything
i
want
in
a
holiday
beera
more
pronounced
malt
profile
warming
from
a
higher
alcohol
content
and
something
unusual
thrown
in
the
mix
no
matter
what
i
could
not
get
agood
taste
out
of
this
the
only
thing
that
helped
a
little
was
allowing
it
to
warm
further
still
flavors
were
muddy
when
not
overshadowed
by
an
overwhelming
astringency
fairly
drinkable
though
perhaps
the
spices
might
get
a
little
cloying
were
i
to
have
more
its
a
bit
strong
for
session
drinking
as
well
still
you
could
do
worse
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
mildly
warming
with
moderate
carbonation
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
about
average
at
least
not
watery
drinkability
is
ok
as
a
slow
sipper
on
a
cold
night
pleasant
but
one
would
probably
do
it
d
looks
great
smells
pretty
good
and
undrinkable
just
cannot
get
anything
other
than
the
look
and
smell
out
of
this
one
sorry
21st
amendment
another
bad
one
mouthfeel
is
rather
still
a
little
dry
not
thick
or
sticky
too
much
sweetness
to
be
very
drinkable
to
me
i
first
had
this
beer
at
my
local
bar
south
in
park
slope
brooklyn
ive
read
a
lot
of
reviews
about
the
beer
in
the
can
version
and
i
think
that
the
draft
may
be
a
bit
different
im
not
usually
one
to
have
this
particular
style
of
beer
but
after
taking
a
sample
of
it
and
drinking
a
full
pint
i
kind
of
liked
it
the
first
smell
was
deceiving
it
smelled
like
a
barbecue
but
the
taste
was
nice
it
was
medium
bodied
slightly
carbonated
and
had
a
mild
casky
smoked
taste
it
followed
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
a
subtle
maltyness
that
i
felt
hid
the
alcohol
content
quite
well
good
end
to
my
night
after
drinking
triples
i
like
the
can
especially
with
the
fdr
art
the
beer
itself
leaves
something
to
be
desired
its
a
rich
red
color
with
a
fairly
small
fizzy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
spice
malt
and
sourness
that
im
not
certain
isnt
originating
from
a
spice
the
taste
is
moderately
malty
with
a
notable
twang
malt
flavor
but
its
a
little
hollow
spice
notes
but
not
very
balanced
no
hop
presence
medium
body
with
a
little
alcohol
coming
out
in
the
hindtaste
all
in
all
this
isnt
as
drinkable
as
i
had
hoped
drink
is
meh
slightly
syrupy
and
semi
sweet
even
finishes
sweet
it
starts
to
get
a
bit
of
minerality
on
teh
finish
as
well
light
spices
and
light
sour
fruits
and
bit
of
booze
give
it
a
tougher
drink
drinkability
soso
at
best
this
is
a
bit
unbalanced
and
slow
sipping
interesting
to
try
but
not
one
i
would
select
for
winter
party
i
kind
of
expected
that
this
would
be
off
was
also
kind
of
looking
forward
to
it
the
sourfunky
aspect
combined
with
the
spicy
winter
ale
notes
were
an
interesting
novelty
at
first
but
soon
gets
to
be
too
much
id
be
interested
to
see
what
this
is
supposed
to
taste
like
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
full
tan
head
head
retention
is
good
leaving
some
nice
lacing
behind
has
kind
of
an
odd
aroma
for
this
style
of
beer
gives
a
lemon
and
grass
aroma
with
some
undiscernable
spices
a
strange
metallic
flavor
comes
through
some
undiscernable
spices
and
an
off
bitter
flavor
d
this
is
a
good
winter
warmer
but
there
are
better
winter
warmers
out
there
that
are
readily
available
for
a
reasonable
price
d
i
love
winter
warmers
i
love
malty
beers
i
love
hearty
beers
i
even
love
spiced
beers
really
thought
id
love
this
one
didnt
something
about
the
metallic
twang
the
tartness
and
an
unappealing
roast
made
this
a
mixed
bag
one
that
i
probably
dont
need
to
get
again
although
reading
reviews
about
the
draft
version
do
sound
better
might
have
it
again
if
i
see
it
on
a
taplist
but
this
was
a
bad
introduction
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
good
beer
bitter
aftertaste
after
a
smooth
initial
start
the
metal
can
is
pretty
good
and
easier
to
use
then
the
traditional
bottle
have
to
admit
that
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
spiced
beers
to
that
makes
my
look
lower
overall
fireside
chat
pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
nose
spices
nutmeg
and
a
sweet
toffee
maltyness
malty
quite
spicy
with
some
vegetalpumpkin
notes
also
a
weird
sourness
that
detracts
from
the
flavor
is
this
infected
if
i
was
told
this
was
a
poorly
made
pumpkin
ale
id
believe
it
falls
pretty
much
flat
on
the
palate
low
carbonation
on
a
medium
to
heavy
body
the
flavors
just
clash
to
me
i
found
this
one
to
be
kind
of
a
mess
nice
try
but
missed
the
mark
for
me
couldnt
finish
a
pint
and
i
was
thirsty
fail
d
nice
way
to
start
the
evening
more
than
one
would
be
overkill
but
overall
its
a
halfway
decent
winter
warmer
worth
a
try
the
abv
is
wellhidden
unlike
some
others
in
the
same
class
drinkability
an
average
winter
warmer
i
could
have
a
couple
the
spices
are
there
but
are
somewhat
muted
i
have
had
better
from
this
brewery
so
far
i
have
had
2
21st
amendment
beers
and
both
have
been
pretty
lackluster
drinkability
depends
on
the
drinker
figure
that
i
happen
to
like
a
good
spiced
dark
beer
especially
when
the
season
calls
for
it
being
in
northern
california
we
get
fog
for
most
of
the
year
so
a
beer
like
this
to
warm
up
a
late
night
is
always
welcome
as
it
warms
the
magnum
and
golding
hop
aromatics
wake
up
and
start
to
balance
out
the
cereal
bill
for
such
a
weighty
grain
profile
i
would
have
expected
more
of
a
bready
mouthfeel
but
the
chat
is
thin
enough
to
be
followed
by
another
without
feeling
stuffed
like
the
proverbial
christmas
goose
feliz
navidad
straight
outta
the
can
so
appearance
here
is
completely
the
artwork
it
smells
like
christmas
and
the
taste
carries
through
as
well
a
lot
of
spice
but
not
all
upfront
and
even
kind
of
cinnamonny
at
the
end
at
7
8
you
might
be
expecting
a
very
hoppy
beer
but
the
spices
do
a
lot
to
balance
out
the
hoppyness
which
scores
points
with
me
i
tend
to
prefer
maltier
brews
carbonation
was
perfect
in
my
can
you
dont
even
realize
its
8
until
you
stand
up
to
get
the
second
one
and
fall
back
down
didnt
see
any
elves
though
like
the
one
fdr
is
chatting
up
on
the
artwork
very
enjoyable
brew
even
at
10
a
6er
ill
be
going
back
for
some
more
d
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
of
a
mess
i
actually
drainpoured
it
in
case
the
21a
cares
the
code
on
the
can
is
0279
2144
not
a
good
beer
taste
is
meh
not
too
much
going
on
here
its
really
disappointing
and
bland
this
is
04
for
21st
amendment
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
with
some
sour
notes
and
some
spices
it
is
all
rather
mild
though
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
im
not
sure
if
the
slight
sourness
i
detect
is
supposed
to
be
there
or
not
but
regardless
it
is
quite
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
like
an
old
cigar
well
past
its
prime
it
is
not
worth
wasting
the
match
to
be
frank
this
beer
is
a
mess
i
have
no
idea
what
the
hell
they
were
trying
to
do
here
and
the
spices
prominently
mentioned
on
the
can
are
a
sideshow
at
best
for
the
trainwreck
of
sour
flavors
and
aromas
that
dominate
i
struggled
to
finish
one
can
not
good
d
drinkable
you
would
never
know
this
was
toward
8
tastes
like
its
5
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer

d
the
lack
of
flavor
and
sheer
dependence
on
the
winter
spices
makes
this
one
hard
to
drink
bummer
here
is
a
case
of
not
judging
a
beer
by
its
cover
fireside
looks
darkish
a
deep
dark
red
deep
maroon
big
brown
with
a
smal
amount
of
tannish
cap
up
above
a
bright
reddish
towards
the
light
leaves
small
clunks
on
the
glass
smell
is
holiday
spice
with
cinnamon
with
a
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
taste
is
brighter
than
expected
cherry
tart
apple
spice
cinnamon
etc
a
bready
thing
in
the
back
traces
of
cocco
and
some
roasted
malt
in
the
end
feel
is
medium
brisk
lively
not
overly
spiced
quaffable
not
cloying
carbey
off
the
tap
feel
is
kinda
similar
in
weightgravity
to
the
monks
blood
that
relesed
lst
year
i
drank
my
pint
quick
and
considered
another
d
hmmm
i
would
have
never
pegged
this
as
a
christmas
holiday
brew
sort
of
generic
but
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
without
needing
any
other
food
or
drink
to
cut
it
i
know
that
my
review
looks
totally
different
than
the
others
on
here
so
maybe
my
taste
buds
are
off
just
maybe
ill
stick
to
my
guns
for
now
dm
you
really
dont
sense
the
alcohol
but
this
really
has
a
nice
clean
flavor
that
is
surprisingly
underwhelming
as
far
as
weight
goes
i
could
have
gone
for
a
thicker
richer
flavor
would
i
buy
more
of
it
sure
im
glad
it
comes
in
a
sixpack
and
i
will
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
it
next
winter
or
maybe
later
this
winter
as
its
a
long
one
here
in
new
england
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
not
overly
drinkable
but
it
has
a
unique
flavor
to
it
i
love
the
packaging
not
that
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
beer
but
says
something
about
the
brewery
i
think
for
a
winter
warmer
this
one
is
pretty
good
pours
deep
brown
with
a
fluffy
creme
head
detailed
lacing
sticks
around
molasses
sweet
aroma
very
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
picking
up
notes
of
cinnamon
and
dark
cherry
surprisingly
mild
and
developed
flavors
as
if
its
been
mellowed
with
time
over
time
some
vanilla
notes
show
up
excellent
round
sweet
finish
not
a
hint
of
the
7
9
abv
d
not
impressed
with
this
one
i
was
hoping
for
some
subtle
spice
to
go
along
with
a
nice
malty
brew
but
this
one
didnt
come
through
d
great
winter
beer
i
love
the
elf
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
really
worked
for
me
as
far
as
winter
warmers
go
which
im
normally
not
to
fond
of
im
normally
not
a
fan
of
spiced
beers
but
they
were
somewhat
tempered
here
by
the
rich
maltiness
although
there
was
a
bit
of
buildup
in
the
back
of
the
throat
by
the
end
of
the
pint
smooth
and
strong
are
also
big
pluses
in
my
book
taste
is
stronger
and
more
complex
overall
excellent
it
has
nice
dark
fruits
some
soured
fruit
and
light
hint
of
balsamic
vinegar
a
lot
of
dark
toast
that
is
nicely
caramelised
wet
leafy
and
woody
spice
it
is
lightly
to
the
sweet
side
with
some
light
bitterness
underneath
the
element
holds
up
very
well
and
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
satisfying
feel
is
very
good
solid
and
lively
i
can
appreciate
this
but
id
move
on
before
too
long
its
a
respectable
offering
from
21st
but
for
now
ill
stick
with
their
hoppier
styles
d
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
and
like
what
21st
ammend
has
done
with
it
however
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
another
holidaychristmaswinter
warmer
i
dont
know
if
this
would
win
out
every
time
0
for
2
tonight
not
sure
i
have
anything
left
in
the
fridge
that
can
totally
ruin
this
night
of
beer
db
i
could
see
this
being
a
decent
beer
from
the
aroma
and
what
comes
through
in
the
flavor
but
the
sourness
and
metallic
aspects
ruin
this
experience
before
it
really
blooms
infection
d
as
far
as
winter
warmers
in
a
can
goes
this
one
is
my
favorite
nothing
really
for
return
visits
but
i
could
see
this
in
my
mixed
sixer
again
since
the
price
is
right
overall
a
rather
middleoftheroad
winter
warmer
that
nevertheless
fits
easily
into
a
winter
coat
pocket
for
assorted
outdoor
events
drinks
ok
very
average
as
far
as
winter
brews
go
would
rather
a
massproduced
winter
warmer
at
this
point
the
metallic
character
gives
canned
craft
beers
a
bad
rep
when
many
others
dont
suffer
from
that
its
not
the
can
just
something
a
bit
off
in
the
beer
d
another
loser
from
21a
this
was
bad
in
just
about
every
way
a
bit
disappointing
did
not
warm
me
at
all
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
tight
dense
khaki
colored
head
which
settles
into
a
light
cap
with
some
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
brown
sugar
and
spices
the
spices
seem
to
be
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
perhaps
some
ginger
i
want
to
say
i
pick
up
some
vanilla
as
well
the
flavor
starts
off
with
a
nice
mellow
chocolate
flavor
but
is
quickly
overwhelmed
with
a
strong
lemon
and
tea
like
flavor
it
has
a
sour
berry
thing
going
on
and
the
spice
that
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
went
in
hiding
no
artifical
flavor
which
is
a
plus
the
feel
is
creamy
yet
has
quite
active
carbonation
the
beer
has
a
moderate
body
and
is
mostly
sour
throughout
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
doesnt
need
to
be
as
high
considering
the
body
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dinged
it
a
bit
because
of
the
style
i
feel
that
it
lacks
on
the
malty
richness
for
the
style
and
is
way
too
sour
for
the
style
i
will
have
no
issues
drinking
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
pours
a
pretty
chestnut
brown
with
a
fingers
worth
of
creamy
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
dark
and
caramel
malt
some
notes
of
holiday
spice
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
palate
is
malty
up
front
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
a
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
holiday
spices
come
through
before
the
swallow
notes
of
clove
allspice
andor
nutmeg
are
present
finish
is
clean
with
just
a
touch
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
body
is
a
little
thin
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
notes
this
can
may
suffer
equally
from
bad
marketing
and
hype
quite
attractive
in
the
design
and
with
a
typically
rather
likable
profile
as
with
the
other
21st
amendment
brews
it
sure
comes
as
a
bit
of
a
hefty
sour
surprise
if
one
is
not
warned
about
that
profile
and
then
one
does
not
like
the
spiced
sourness
it
is
bound
to
disappoint
ultimately
it
is
not
that
bad
a
brew
but
being
a
bit
clearer
about
the
overall
profile
might
help
it
quite
a
bit
d
not
a
big
fan
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
for
me
i
am
afraid
i
got
a
bad
batch
it
was
that
bad
unless
it
was
meant
to
be
a
sour
beer
then
they
hit
it
dead
on
d
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
and
feeling
great
i
will
definitely
buy
more
this
winter
season
d
a
decent
winter
warmer
could
be
a
bit
heavier
in
body
would
think
that
a
hotoutoftheoven
chocolate
brownie
with
hot
chocolate
sauce
on
it
would
be
a
perfect
pairing
for
this
t
very
carbonated
but
not
much
spice
taste
i
cant
tell
exactly
what
the
flavor
is
im
tasting
its
sweet
with
some
bitterness
not
a
great
taste
the
taste
is
offputting
the
other
characteristics
of
the
beer
are
good
but
the
sourness
makes
me
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
something
wouldnt
try
this
again
unless
i
knew
for
a
fact
i
got
a
bad
one
d
this
beer
is
worth
trying
for
the
sake
of
being
unique
and
interesting
but
it
is
not
something
i
could
see
myself
seeking
out
or
even
drinking
again
the
end
product
seems
to
be
over
spiced
and
just
doesnt
translate
to
a
great
beer
this
is
a
milder
christmas
ale
a
bit
of
a
muted
version
of
the
anchor
version
still
flavorful
apparently
i
liked
it
better
than
most
people
here
poured
from
the
can
into
a
standard
shaker
pint
pours
a
murky
golden
brown
a
slight
smell
of
molases
is
present
but
not
much
else
taste
is
nonexistant
no
flavor
at
all
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
it
takes
away
from
the
severe
lack
of
any
flavor
this
is
a
downright
undrinkable
beer
fail
md
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
everything
is
good
about
this
beer
except
the
taste
which
is
the
most
important
thing
a
real
big
letdown
was
hoping
for
much
more
but
will
probably
not
have
this
again
easy
drinking
easily
addictive
a
great
seasonal
winter
beer
drinkability
a
decent
brew
props
for
the
presidential
can
art
doesnt
have
an
elevated
appeal
for
me
like
winter
warmers
generally
do
but
this
is
more
of
a
spiced
brown
ale
flavorful
spiced
up
creation
with
notes
of
smoke
burnt
malts
dark
chocolate
then
quite
dry
in
the
finish
taste
is
all
over
the
place
and
doesnt
really
come
together
all
that
well
on
the
thin
side
and
lacking
a
solid
finish
another
blah
beer
from
21st
amendment
contract
brewed
in
minnesota
im
getting
the
feeling
this
brand
is
all
style
and
little
substance
nice
looking
gaphics
on
the
can
and
packaging
fairly
lame
attempt
at
a
craft
brew
in
the
can
it
is
warming
but
this
is
a
less
then
decent
winter
warmernight
capper
d
not
a
real
drinkable
beer
though
i
would
say
that
about
most
spiced
ales
just
too
much
going
on
too
drink
more
than
1
or
2
pours
a
deep
amber
to
almost
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sugary
caramel
like
standing
in
a
candy
shop
in
the
taste
roasty
quite
sugary
and
very
candy
like
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
hint
of
dry
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
sugary
and
candy
like
ok
but
it
could
be
too
much
after
one
i
dont
even
want
to
spend
any
more
time
on
this
review
it
was
so
bad
stay
away
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
ww
but
this
one
brings
something
new
to
the
style
for
me
ill
keep
my
eye
out
for
it
on
draft
pours
a
dark
ambercherry
color
with
decent
head
decent
lacing
immediate
aroma
of
sourness
funk
and
sweet
candied
malts
wtf
definitely
not
what
i
expected
smells
like
a
flemish
redsour
ale
taste
follows
with
brettomyceslike
sourness
and
funk
along
with
sweet
malts
cherries
and
bittertartsour
finish
mouthfeel
is
semi
dry
kind
of
thin
i
really
do
not
understand
this
beer
at
all
and
not
sure
what
they
were
aiming
for
i
dont
pick
up
any
of
the
cinnamon
and
utmeg
spice
that
they
claim
to
have
thrown
in
im
so
confused
d
good
not
great
it
was
interesting
to
try
but
im
not
sure
this
is
going
on
the
buy
again
next
winter
list
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
a
nice
spiced
ale
good
for
a
winter
evening
nice
to
try
if
you
like
a
very
heavy
spiced
brew
drinkability
the
beer
was
enjoyable
i
didnt
hate
it
i
didnt
love
it
im
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
though
the
flavor
is
an
improvement
theres
a
hazelnut
element
to
the
tongue
it
has
a
mild
peppery
bite
in
the
swallow
this
is
a
surprisingly
thin
brew
there
is
a
minor
metallic
presence
in
the
taste
but
overall
it
is
true
to
the
winter
warmer
style
dan
average
winter
warmer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
some
amber
hues
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
with
spices
considerable
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
taste
is
a
bit
subdued
compared
with
the
smell
hops
up
front
a
strong
spice
presence
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
d
i
hesitated
on
picking
this
one
up
and
now
im
wishing
i
didnt
ive
tried
a
few
21st
amendment
brews
before
and
i
have
liked
them
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
tasted
like
a
slightly
roasted
saison
got
one
can
as
a
free
sample
from
work
poured
a
dark
red
color
into
my
small
glass
i
was
excited
to
try
this
since
i
am
a
fan
of
their
beers
and
i
have
been
to
their
restaurant
unfortunately
for
me
this
beer
didnt
hold
up
for
me
to
their
other
beers
such
as
watermelon
wheat
and
their
ipa
im
not
impressed
with
it
its
not
something
i
would
get
again
it
doesnt
have
much
flavor
so
it
falls
flat
and
without
flavor
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
a
beer
chestnutmahogany
body
with
a
thick
foamy

very
dark
without
being
pitch
black
nose
is
very
spicy
somewhat
musty
with
notes
of
cinnamon
ginger
and
caramel
flavor
is
of
chocolate
malt
caramel
belgian

slightly
funkysour
similar
to
a
dark
saison
ala
fantome
and
moderately
hoppy
creamy
full
body
with
moderate
carbonation
slightly
metallic
not
too
crazy
about
this
one
but
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
pours
a
deep
brown
mahogany
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
toward
the
light
also
forms
a
light
tan
head
rising
above
my
chalice
fine
even
speckled
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
aroma
has
a
dark
roasty
cocoa
accent
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
used
hints
of
subtle
spices
added
as
well
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
coated
with
honey
glaze
herbalmild
citrus
hops
in
the
background
i
see
the
beer
actually
clocks
in
at
45
ibus
i
wouldnt
have
estimated
it
being
that
high
flavor
has
dark
roasted
malts
cocoa
rustic
dark
breadiness
herbal
citric
hops
with
spices
running
through
a
nice
tartness
comes
through
the
middle
of
it
almost
has
some
orange
peel
characteristics
ample
bitterness
amongst
the
malts
and
spice
additions
a
nice
complex
canned
ale
perfect
for
the
colder
weather
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
dry
bitter
finish
from
the
spices
and
moderate
hop
dose
carbonation
is
moderate
tickles
the
throat
a
good
bit
but
also
carries
the
spices
across
the
palate
nicely
drinkability
overall
im
glad
i
grabbed
a
six
of
this
for
9
99
it
will
last
me
throughout
the
winter
months
a
can
here
or
there
is
what
i
would
like
to
do
not
much
of
a
beer
i
want
to
sit
and
enjoy
in
number
but
its
nice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
type
of
beer
my
aggressive
crack
pour
again
threatened
to
overflow
the
glass
but
to
no
avail
i
had
a
big
rocky
two
fingers
of
mochatan
head
with
modest
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
ruby
highlights
at
the
edges
nose
was
big
with
cinnamon
coupled
with
dark
chocolate
i
was
reminded
of
mexican
hot
chocolate
with
its
infusion
of
spices
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
chocolate
all
intermingling
on
my
tongue
tasty
finish
lingered
with
a
pleasant
admixture
of
spice
which
overpowered
the
chocolate
i
cant
recommend
putting
this
in
a
cooler
but
maybe
by
the
fireplace
on
christmas
eve
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
could
drink
several
of
them
and
will
be
drinking
it
again
drinkability
wasnt
a
very
exciting
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
drain
pour
i
guess
i
can
understand
why
this
beer
didnt
work
for
some
people
but
i
find
it
fairly
enjoyable
the
sourness
is
mild
and
doesnt
clash
with
the
spices
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
with
some
plastic
and
metal
the
beer
has
medium
to
light
body
with
creamy
carbonation
it
doesnt
feel
bad
but
the
lingering
artificial
tastes
make
me
never
want
another
sip
this
is
going
down
the
drain
i
bought
this
single
for
1
49
and
i
wont
take
another
big
mac
priced
gamble
on
another
21st
amendment
beer
again
seriously
who
is
buying
this
stuff
the
black
ipa
sucked
the
ipa
has
less
flavor
in
the
whole
can
than
avery
or
oskar
blues
have
in
one
sip
and
the
watermelon
beer
tastes
like
corn
stop
the
madness
youre
doing
a
disservice
to
craft
beer
d
not
bad
but
probably
not
a
warmer
i
would
go
back
to
in
the
future
drinkability
terrible
im
convinced
i
had
an
infected
batch
i
really
hope
so
as
most
of
the
previous
stuff
from
21st
amendment
as
been
good
drinkability
the
burnt
metallic
finish
just
kills
this
and
destroys
any
complexity
not
really
sure
where
the
spices
are
either
although
i
thought
i
smelled
a
little
kicking
myself
now
for
picking
up
a
6
pack
its
nut
what
i
expected
although
alcohol
is
well
hidden
its
very
dry
and
stouty
in
flavor
but
not
in
color
so
it
is
somwhat
misleading
the
only
way
i
can
really
drink
this
is
by
chugging
it
and
even
then
its
a
difficult
task
this
is
just
not
good
i
can
count
on
one
hand
how
many
drainpours
ive
ever
had
and
this
one
is
going
to
get
added
to
that
there
is
nothing
natural
about
the
nose
or
the
taste
here
avoid
this
beer
at
all
costs
unless
you
like
drinking
aerosol
cans
of
room
freshening
spray
overall
this
is
a
winter
warmer
thats
very
close
to
being
over
the
top
but
it
stops
just
short
a
robust
and
well
done
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
can
poured
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
tan
frothy
head
toasty
roasted
aroma
a
little
dusting
of
nutmeg
over
a
smooth
brown
ale
flavor
is
somewhat
stale
malting
with
some
graininess
and
along
with
some
allspice
finishes
kinda
weak
med
body
doesnt
taste
bad
but
expect
more
from
a
holiday
brew
one
bright
note
the
drawing
on
the
can
is
very
well
done
and
appropriate
too
bad
that
doesnt
count
for
anything
overall
a
decent
enough
brew
but
nothing
special
try
it
once
and
decide
for
yourself
cool
beer
cool
can
guess
im
back
in
your
camp
for
now
21st
the
flavor
is
nutty
malt
with
a
very
earthy
edge
the
yeast
flavor
seems
to
be
prominent
as
well
the
spice
is
pretty
subdued
the
flavor
of
this
for
some
reason
reminds
me
of
a
doppelbock
the
end
of
the
flavor
comes
off
as
tart
with
a
bit
of
spice
kick
overall
this
needs
more
spice
of
bigger
malt
or
perhaps
a
bigger
malt
profile
because
this
is
kind
of
underwhelming
albeit
tasty
there
are
dark
cherries
involved
along
with
plums
too
a
very
good
spiced
winter
warmer
although
not
quite
to
the
level
of
anchors
our
special
ale
drinkability
takes
a
bit
of
a
hit
as
it
is
hard
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
spiced
beer
in
an
evening
but
i
certainly
did
enjoy
trying
this
and
will
save
the
rest
of
the
6pack
for
around

created

and
stout
like
prickly
carbonation
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
malt
flavors
provide
a
solid
balance
very
flavorful
brew
great
porter
flavors
it
is
a
bit
thick
for
my
liking
i
prefer
my
porters
thinner
to
distinguish
itself
from
a
stout
this
is
great
wish
i
had
a
6er
of
them
an
excellent
strong
porter
for
the
colder
weather
seasons
honestly
i
could
see
myself
wanting
two
or
three
of
these
but
at
its
abv
and
with
its
bevy
of
wellpronounced
flavors
i
think
one
pint
is
enough
almost
opaque
with
a
sliver
of
reddishbrown
at
the
top
of
the
glass
and
a
frothy
tan
head
this
definitely
tastes
like
a
winter
warmer
but
with
the
dark
malts
balancing
out
the
typical
brown
ale
type
winter
warmer
aspect
aroma
is
very
hoppy
with
the
american
hops
being
prevalent
flavor
is
more
fruity
with
dried
fruit
being
the
major
flavor
you
get
candied
apples
plums
raisins
they
are
all
here
hops
are
noticeable
but
not
as
much
as
the
aroma
would
indicate
moutfeel
is
chewy
and
thick
this
does
seem
to
blend
a
few
styles
together
and
the
label
of
english
porter
might
not
be
the
most
accurate
to
me
more
of
a
holiday
stout
in
my
opinion
the
local
liquor
store
just
got
this
in
from
a
new
distributor
and
i
think
im
going
to
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
over
the
next
couple
of
months
drinkability
this
is
my
first
nøgne
ø
beer
and
it
is
rather
enjoyable
it
is
finally
a
cooler
night
here
in
southern
california
which
is
why
i
decided
to
open
this
up
i
can
taste
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
as
it
warms
me
on
the
way
down
not
in
an
unpleasant
sense
however
one
bottle
of
this
and
i
would
be
done
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
spiciness
to
it
drinkability
as
anachronistic
as
it
may
seem
i
tried
this
yulebrew
on
midsummers
eve
but
lord
chtulhu
oh
lord
was
it
ever
so
delightful
additionally
this
particular
beer
goes
great
with
chervil
tarragon
and
junipergraved
reindeer
fillet
enjoy
solid
here
and
other
fine
offering
from
them
and
one
i
would
love
to
try
again
they
seem
to
really
be
quite
solid
in
all
they
do
and
this
one
is
no
exception
incredibly
bitter
coffee
roasts
matched
with
extremely
bitter
chocolates
very
thin
a
little
harsh
in
the
aftertaste
slight
creaminess
with
no
hop
presence
probably
covered
up
by
the
coffee
and
chocolates
wouldnt
seek
out
again
it
looks
like
all
of
their
offerings
fall
pale
in
comparison
to
their
dark
horizon
very
solid
beer
they
just
need
to
get
that
carbonation
under
control
or
make
some
adjustments
in
other
ways
to
keep
the
gush
away
this
is
a
really
good
porter
something
i
would
recommend
conclusion
this
is
a
tasty
winter
brew
its
big
roasty
warming
and
packed
with
flavor
very
english
in
style
but
its
from
norway
which
is
kind
of
cool
not
a
home
run
but
definitely
worth
seeking
out
d
as
a
beer
this
one
gets
good
marks
except
for
the
artifical
taste
i
got
which
was
minor
but
as
a
winter
beer
i
dont
get
anything
that
would
classify
this
apart
from
other
porters
drinkability
this
is
expensive
stuff
as
all
the
nøgne
ø
beers
are
but
it
was
certainly
worth
a
bottle
very
different
from
all
the
others
of
the
style
ive
had
which
makes
it
quite
an
experience
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
along
with
the
100
and
imperial
stout
i
still
have
also
great
atmosphere
impressive
appearance
and
a
full
complex
nose
flavor
is
not
as
complex
as
the
nose
but
nicely
balanced
and
full
really
thorough
and
full
body
great
quaff
d
full
of
flavour
and
something
id
drink
more
of
shame
its
so
pricey
like
most
beers
from
this
brewery
hv
probably
a
little
overpriced
but
i
was
glad
to
try
it
roasted
chocolate
a
little
oatmeal
but
mainly
roasted
chocolate
coming
through
on
the
tongue
slight
burnt
aftertaste
just
thick
enough
for
a
porter
d
very
good
delicious
smooth
and
delightful
i
see
why
there
is
a
buzz
about
this
brewery
grab
one
while
its
still
porter
weather
mouthfeel
is
really
well
done
also
creamy
and
plush
i
would
easily
drink
this
again
and
again
d
very
drinkable
beer
great
taste
perfect
for
a
chilly
night
d
drinkability
was
of
course
was
very
good
with
a
warming
beautiful
winter
feel
that
was
beautifully
exceuted
making
for
a
great
example
of
style
one
that
is
sure
to
warm
and
cheer
you
up
d
i
just
finished
it
and
i
want
another
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
of
this
and
some
other
offerings
by
nogne
o
d
another
fine
offering
from
this
brewery
a
heavy
chewy
winter
selection
that
i
would
reach
for
again
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
porter
winter
ale
try
one
if
you
get
the
chance
prosit
mk
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
complex
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
burnt
toffee
chocolate
and
hops
it
also
has
a
slight
roasted
character
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
and
creamy
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
moderate
roasted
feel
and
light
chocolate
notes
it
goes
down
easy
with
some
yeasty
esters
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
near
perfect
carbonation
this
is
an
exceptional
winter
ale
its
quite
complex
and
very
easy
drinking
a
real
treat
drinkability
my
first
beer
from
this
brewer
in
fact
the
first
i
have
ever
seen
in
a
store
i
am
impressed
with
this
well
balanced
and
flavorful
beer
looking
forward
to
tracking
down
more
from
them
winter
ale
is
a
very
good
beer
but
really
needs
a
little
more
zeal
more
hops
a
little
spiciness
perhaps
something
for
sure
its
a
nice
beer
thats
easily
recommended
but
it
could
use
a
little
work
in
my
opinion
fab
man
fab
really
interesting
play
on
characteristics
poured
with
a
big
foamy
frothy
tan
head
with
lots
a
lace
very
dark
brown
aromatic
thats
like
the
taste
sweet
yet
dry
luscious
yet
stark
and
bittersweet
even
so
lots
of
bitter
chocolate
coffee
dark
ripe
fruit
heavy
hops
lots
going
on
here
superb
beer
long
finish
not
a
session
beer
but
thats
ok
overall
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
except
for
the
price
try
other
stuff
from
nogne
what
a
great
beer
the
only
weak
part
is
the
subtle
smell
excellent
brewery
ill
have
to
buy
more
of
their
beers
this
beer
is
closing
in
on
imperial
porter
territory
due
to
its
strong
flavor
and
high
alcohol
content
delicious
and
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
stouts
and
porters
this
beer
poured
beautifully
with
a
nice
dense
creamcolored
head
and
a
dark
amber
brown
color
smelled
lovely
tooheavy
burned
caramel
aromas
with
a
hint
of
spice
however
the
flavor
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
tasted
much
too
strongly
of
molasses
and
raisiny
fruit
to
please
my
palate
i
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
the
molasses
just
got
even
more
overpoweringa
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
just
fine
a
medium
to
heavy
body
with
very
pleasing
carbonation
drinkability
as
stated
above
this
appears
to
be
a
porter

the
taste
starts
off
with

turning
nutty
wheaty
and
a

strong
the
beer
is
damn

than

from

oat

in

brewed
with
rye
sage
caraway

and
chestnuts
they
meld
together
to
form
a
unique
flavor

everything
is
so
balanced
it
is
almost
nondistinct
the
beer
is
full

very
smooth
on

soft

carbonation
makes
for
a
smooth
drink
the
beer
poured
from

just
a

heady

this
would
certainly
be
considered
a

months
but
honestly
not
so
much
right
now
and
not
so
much
with
some
age
on
it
really
not
digging
this
one

that
much
picked
this

the
nose
is
spicy
complex
and
absolutely
amazing
hints
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
coffee
dark
fruit
molasses
maple
sage
and

the
taste
is
just
as
amazing
and
just

complex
strong
malty
and
spicy
base
with
hints
of
toffee
cinnamon
nutmeg
pine
maple
syrup
black
cherries
sage
rye
and
chestnuts
i
had
a
beer
this
past
summer
in
the
south
of
france
made
with
chestnuts
and
im
really
liking
what
they
add
in
flavor
hopefully
it
catches
on
im
also
getting
some
subtle
dark
chocolate
emerging
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
a
subtle
tanginess
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
home
run
winter
warmer
its
amazingly
complex
but
totally
drinkable
a
top
notch
beer
from
three
awesome
breweries
the
beer
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
with
an
inch
of
creamy
tan
head
that
laces
slightly
reminiscent
of
guinness
honestly
it
looks
like
it
could
have
poured
from
a
nitro
tap
the
nose
is
potently
herbal
with
notes
of
white
sage
cutting
through
the
surface
it
reminds
me
of
the
holidays
poured
into
a
glass
with
an
initial
rye
bread
sweetness
perfectly
blended
with
chestnuts
and
piney
sage
the
beer
was
more
aromatic
and
flavorful
when
i
had
it
a
month
ago
but
it
still
packs
a
distinct
punch
of
flavor
the
taste
carries
a
lot
of
bready
sweetness
which
transitions
into
a
slightly
bitter
herbal
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
and
modestly
sweet
with
a
fresh
herbal
finish
there
is
definitely
a
touch
of
roasted
chestnutsmalt
which
compliments
the
beers
herbal
aftertaste
this
beer
is
very
well
done
and
definitely
worth
trying
it
encapsulates
everything
i
want
in
a
winter
warmer
with
a
unique
twist
on
the
traditional
winter
warmer

profile
its
an
excellent
collaboration

with
easy
availability

distribution
and
reasonable

point
poured
a
dark
brownish
hue
with
good
head
and
lace
a
peppery
hoppy
spiced
beer
is
my
first
aroma
but
i
pick
up
some
good
sweet
malts
like
caramel
or
figs
as
well
beer
is
wellbalanced
as
both
minor
citric
hops
and
sweetness
i
seem
to
pick
up
figs
and
toffee
which
is
odd
are
both
evident
and
the
beer
passes
easy
and
fullish
as
there
is
a
breadiness
to
the
beer
that
makes
it
an
easy
passing
dessert
sipper
a
quality
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
which
is
all
one
can
ask
for
a
winter
style
beer
o
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
very
complex
and
so
easy
to
drink
im
extremely
glad
that
nøgne
decided
to
put
out
another
release
of
this
maybe
stone
and
jp
did
as
well
but
im
not
sure
as
this
would
be
a
regular
winter
beer
in
my
fridge
even
at
the
price
of
9
for
the
0
5l
bottle
this
gets
the
highest
of
recommendations
from
me
for
the
style
overall
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
and
look
forward
to
seeing
how
this
beer
does
over
time
well
its
not
bad
but
as
im
finishing
the
bottle
i
feel
its
on
the
dull
side
could
use
a
little
hop
twang
or
some
funk
to
liven
things
up
doesnt
quaff
all
that
hard
but
i
doubt
ill
go
chasing
this
one
down
either

the
differences
in

produce
different

go
being

and
made
for

it
can
only
get
a

better
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
o
this
was
a
very
spiced
up

warmer
i
have
had
nothing
quite
like
this
tasted
like
eating
a
bunch
of
random
spicy
berries
out
of

maybe
give
this
a
shot
if
you
see
in
on
the
shelf
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
o
its
a

drink
and
in

has

dont

a

ive
had

this
is

beer
it
has
a

semblance
to
it
but
its
rather
complex
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
its
definitely
good
for
the
season
overall
a
real

beer
thats
different
and
very

this
surprised
me
i
thought
it
might
be
past
its
prime
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
holiday
ale
with
decent
flavor
and
almost
humorous
smell
the
beer
is
brown
with
a
small
head
that
fades
rapidly
leaving
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
grandiose
with
pine
christmas
spices
and
alcohol
the
flavor
brings
a
huge
pine
needle
flavor
like
drinking
christmas
tree
juice
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
sprinkled
on
top
the
body
is
thin
and
the
flavor
while
decent
is
overbearing
i
would
prefer
more
balance
and
subtlety
a
small
portion
was
more
than
enough
for
me
pours
a

and
a

loads

and
a

it
down

for
air
in
the
light
this
beer
look
fantastic
beautiful
looking
color
with
a
nice
creamy
looking
head
the
aroma
is
very
impressive
as
well
its
loaded
with
pine
spices
and
some
christmas
berry
aromas
there
is
a
slight
hop
aroma
in
there
too
the
taste
of
this
beer
has
a
healthy
amount
of
spices
pumpkin
berries
and
even
a
touch
of
mint
in
the
late
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
heavy
its
got
the
a
really
great
feel
to
it
for
the
winter
months
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
had
to
date
i
enjoyed
just
about
everything
this
beer
had
to
offer
look
forward
to
having
this
time
and
time
again
during
the
winter
months
o
i
went
into
this
one
with
absolutely
zero
expectations
or
knowledge
of
what
to
expect
in
the
right
context
i
think
this
is
actually
a
very
good
beer
a
somewhat
warm
late
april
night
might
not
be
the
best
timing
for
this
late
night
after
a
good
meal
snow
outside
in
front
of
the
fire
sharing
this
bottle
with
a
friend
or
two
this
would
be
great
hopefully
i
can
remember
to
pick
up
another
one
of
these
for
the
next
such
occasion
although
after
the
winter
we
had
here
in
ma
not
looking
forward
to
that
occasion
especially
verdict
world
class
holiday
ale
absolutely
worth
tracking
down
even
at
this
outrageous
price
point
drinkability
i
prefer
the
stone
version
of
this
and
would
have
preferred
to
have
it
fresh
despite
it
being
in
the
fridge
since
purchase
i
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
christmas
spice
beer
with
finish
that
reminds
you
that
its
beer
you
are
drinking
the
cpj
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
to
me
only
because
i
enjoy
the
complexity
of
spices
if
you
dont
like
the
taste
of
spices
or
are
not
a
huge
fan
of
winter
warmers
you
will
probably
severely
dislike
this
beer
i
enjoyed
the
balance
and
blending
of
the
spices
to
creat
a
wellbalanced
beer
spices
can
be
overpowering
on
your
first
few
drinks
but
they
ultiamtely
smooth
out
to
make
this
beer
lightmedium
bodied
d
drinkability
is
high
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
in
this
beer
and
the
incorporation
of
spices
and
unique
ingredients
help
to
enhance
the
beer
drinking
experience
rather
than
hinder
it
as
i
felt
saison
du
buff
did
while
a
bit
pricey
at
around
10
a
bottle
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
next
year
if
its
available
to
pop
actually
around
the
holidays
t
tastes
very
belgian
some
sweet
yeast
flavors
that
reminded
me
a
bit
of
chimay
a
bit
of
nuttiness
behind
the
yeast
flavors
and
some
herbal
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
seemed
a
little
out
of
place
pretty
tasty
but
not
worth
the
steep
price
this
is
an
interesting
and
warming
winter
warmer
sipper
nice
for
a
chicago
snow
storm
pours
a
thick
hazy
mahogany
with
a
silky
tan
head
nice
malty
nose
has
chocolate
dates
figs
and
spices
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
caramel
toffee
dark
pitted
fruits
nutty
malts
and
xmas
spices
full
body
light
carbonation
much
better
than
original
batch
d
nice
holiday
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
would
definitely
seek
out
again
if
it
were
available
too
bad
this
was
only
a
one
time
collaboration
effort
pours
a
murky
yeasty
brown
color
with
an
extremely
small
offwhite
head
scent
definitely
has
the
juniper
berries
and
some
light
tartness
to
it
it
also
has
some
medicinal
aromas
as
well
i
also
get
a
tiny
bit
of
chocolate
and
spices
taste
is
surprising
has
a
tad
bit
of
that
funkiness
that
jp
is
known
for
but
nowhere
near
the
amount
their
normal
lineup
has
i
also
get
some
dark
malt
flavors
and
roasted
chestnuts
the
taste
has
a
somewhat
medicinal
characteristic
to
it
also
which
is
this
beers
only
flaw
i
think
not
really
getting
the
juniper
berries
in
the
flavor
but
i
do
get
mild
chocolate
flavors
and
and
some
delightful
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
exactly
how
i
would
want
a
winter
warmer
to
be
full
bodied
and
a
bit
syrupy
with
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
burn
drinkability
is
fairly
decent
winter
warmers
a
by
far
not
a
style
i
prefer
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
by
far
the
medicinal
characteristics
bring
this
beer
down
a
bit
though
alcohol
is
showing
up
a
little
more
as
it
warms
but
not
as
prevalent
when
initially
poured
sweeter
and
more
warm
after
it
has
been
sitting
for
20
minutes
so
i
am
upgrading
my
score
slightly
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
try
for
its
uniqness
but
not
for
the
drinkability
smell
or
taste
drinkability
would
love
another
quite
an
odd
brew
but
appropriate
for
a
spicy
winter
warmer
this
beer
pours
a
dark
coca
cola
color
with
a
think
tan
head
aromas
of
steel
and
cough
medicine
are
present
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
a
heavy
sweetness
dominates
the
front
of
this
beer
caramel
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
worcestershire
the
finish
a
very
slight
hop
note
special
holiday
ale
a
collaboration
between
nogne
o
jolly
pumpkin
and
stone
brewing
pours
a
dark
brown
color
from
a
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
medicinal
so
is
the
flavor
this
beer
really
just
does
not
work
for
me
i
could
get
through
a
glass
but
medicinal
is
the
only
taste
that
i
can
get
some
of
my
friends
liked
it
at
least
until
i
mentioned
that
i
thought
it
tasted
medicinal
then
they
quickly
agreed
and
also
decided
they
didnt
especially
like
it
your
mileage
may
vary
tasty
robust
i
had
a
few
spiced
beers
from
nøgne
ø
and
they
all
more
or
less
seem
to
share
these
odd
fatsoapy
flavours
i
dont
enjoy
them
a
nice
different
brew
with
sage
this
works
but
no
5s
for
this
one
d
a
good
holiday
sipper
perfect
to
share
with
someone
around
the
fireplace
very
very
mild
alcohol
warming
comes
through
on
the
finish
of
this
one
drinkability
a
little
too
big
on
the
spices
for
me
highly
drinkable
it
is
too
bad
this
beer
is
as
expensive
as
it
it
at
8
99
for
a
pint
this
will
be
my
only
time
enjoying
this
beer
this
year
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
this
beer
is
just
a
bit
too
sweet
to
have
high
drinkability
beyond
that
im
not
sure
that
this
one
is
worth
the
high
price
tag
if
youre
really
invested
in
any
of
the
three
collaborative
breweries
or
spice
beers
or
hell
if
youre
into
dubbels
it
may
be
worth
checking
out
a
bit
over
priced
but
a
easily
drinkable
holiday
brew
all
of
the
spices
create
quite
an
interesting
beer
and
one
i
would
recommend
i
just
probably
would
not
drink
more
than
one
of
them
happy
holidays
its
nice
and
spicy
i
had
the
stone
version
about
a
year
ago
and
it
was
much
more
in
your
face
with
all
the
spices
this
is
much
more
mellow
not
sure
if
thats
because
its
the
nøgneø
version
or
because
its
been
aging
longer
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
and
creamy
thick
and
a
bit
chewy
as
well
overall
a
good
holiday
beer
my
last
one
for
the
year
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
pleasantly
viscous
overall
an
interesting
and
flavorful
warmer
spice
character
is
initially
intense
but
seems
to
mellow
as
it
warms
i
cant
recommend
based
on
the
10
price
point
for
only
500ml
and
there
are
much
less
intense
spiced
winter
warmer
offerings
which
are
easier
to
find
and
less
expensive
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
the
oats
are
a
definite
plus
for
the
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
pleasing
drinkability
is
a
plus
here
there
are
some
unique
flavors
thrown
in
here
but
they
all
tend
to
compliment
each
other
well
a
very
enjoyable
holiday
concoction
drinkability
with
the
combo
of
nøgne
ø
jolly
pumpkin
artisan
ales
and
stone
brewing
co
how
could
you
go
wrong
this
is
truly
a
concoction
made
from
the
three
wise
men
bravo
to
this
great
collaboration
d
a
solid
and
respectable
winter
warmer
but
nothing
spectacular
the
aroma
takes
a
bit
to
get
used
to
but
seems
to
be
lacking
a
bit
in
terms
of
substance
and
complexity
perhaps
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
when
compared
to
my
fellow
ba
reviews
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
it
due
to
the
high
spice
content
that
said
i
would
be
overjoyed
to
polish
off
a
bottle
of
this
by
myself
and
even
happier
to
share
some
with
some
friends
dthe
alcohol
hits
fairly
quickly
its
a
quite
filling
beer
as
well
the
taste
stays
well
but
this
might
be
a
good
beer
to
share
with
someone
special
on
a
cold
winter
night
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
foam
lining
the
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
out
of
this
world
its
like
there
is
a
pumpkin
party
in
my
nose
and
everyone
is
invited
i
am
told
that
in
addition
to
the
other
ingredient
it
is
the
juniper
that
is
making
me
go
wild
for
this
aroma
the
taste
however
doesnt
seem
to
really
match
the
intensity
of
this
beer
the
spices
exist
that
youd
find
in
a
pumpkin
pie
but
i
find
them
to
be
more
biting
on
the
tongue
than
helpful
in
the
flavoring
of
the
beer
still
a
pretty
good
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
syrupy
side
for
my
liking
i
dont
think
that
i
would
ever
turn
this
beer
down
if
it
were
offered
to
me
a
delicious
winter
warmer
if
a
little
odd
and
unexpected
very
very
dark
color
with
tan
head
very
strong
lacing
albeit
from
an
aggressive
pour
into
my
snifter
smell
is
mostly
of
roasted
malts
similar
to
a
porterstout
along
with
some
vague
winter
spices
that
are
hard
to
pick
out
and
some
dark
fruits
very
strange
caramel
and
malt
flavor
right
off
the
bat
there
is
a
flavor
in
here
im
having
trouble
picking
up
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
of
things
drinkability
is
good
its
a
decent
winter
warmer
although
definitely
not
worth
the
10
price
for
500ml
drink
the
perfect
way
to
end
a
25
hour
car
ride
from
ca
to
ks
on
turkey
day
10
overall
impressions
are
enjoyable
and
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
but
nothing
i
will
seek
out
next
winter
might
shelve
my
other
bottles
this
one
strikes
me
as
an
ager
d
this
is
a
one
off
for
me
but
definitely
interesting
to
say
the
least
fine
job
overall
an
interesting
and
flavorful
warmer
spice
character
is
initially
intense
but
seems
to
mellow
as
it
warms
definitely
worth
a
try
nicely

a

beer
hereiam
not
a
big
fan
of
jupiner
berry
flavors
but
there
is
a
nice
mix
of
other
flavors
in
the
profile
nogne
special
holiday
ale
is
what
happens
when
three
talented
brewers
put
their
heads
together
and
start
experimenting
it
wont
be
for
everyone
but
this
stuff
blows
anchor
our
special
ale
which
it
resembles
out
of
the
water
an
interesting
beer
to
be
sure
but
the
flavour
is
somewhat
compelling
d
very
easy
to
drink
d
a
little
heavy
on
the
spices
but
i
am
starting
to
like
that
in
winter
warmers
drinkability
i
go
back
and
forth
on
the
mouthfeel
but
have
ultimately
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
would
like
a
slightly
more
traditional
mouthfeel
still
the
spice
character
of
this
beer
is
very
unique
and
while
i
would
not
want
more
than
one
at
a
setting
it
is
well
worth
checking
out
d
for
a
holiday
spiced
beer
this
drinks
very
nicely
nothing
is
too
overbarring
or
abrasive
well
balanced
with
that
wonderful
feel
again
particularly
creamy
yet
brisk
on
the
tongue
all
the
herbal
qualities
were
there
great
beer
made
by
the
fruit
sweet
sourherbal
and
briskcreamy
dichotomy
d
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
that
was
definitely
heavy
on
spices
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
the
smell
had
a
very
unique
smell
to
it
which
i
think
was
the
juniper
beers
and
the
taste
was
a
pretty
standard
winter
warmer
would
give
another
shot
and
would
be
interested
in
trying
side
by
side
with
the
other
breweries
versions
d
sipper
in
front
of
a
fire
a
whole
lot
of
spice
and
the
abv
is
decently
hidden
at
first
but
as
it
opens
up
more
it
becomes
more
and
more
alcoholic
spices
and
nuts
are
really
good
in
this
but
the
sheer
amount
of
spice
is
a
bit
on
overload
for
the
senses
good
winter
warmer
on
steroids
on
a
cold
december
night
this
would
be
awesome
it
was
terrific
in
july
as
well
i
wonder
if
theyll
do
this
one
again
really
nice
id
buy
this
one
again
for
sure
super
dece
beer
poured
with
a
tan
fine
foamy
head
and
a
little
lace
color
is
an
almost
opaque
mahoganey
brown
aroma
is
malty
spicey
dark
ripe
fruits
flavor
is
like
aroma
but
the
spices
come
out
more
can
definitely
pick
out
the
sage
and
juniper
chestnuts
are
muted
body
and
carbonation
are
perfect
for
the
style
round
full
fine
aggresive
but
not
overdone
bubbles
finish
is
like
flavor
very
well
balance
and
short
to
medium
long
easy
drinking
beer
could
have
another
be
real
good
with
hearty
meals
the
texture
is
very
smooth
despite
the
more
than
ample
carbonation
i
think
though
that
i
would
like
the
consistency
just
a
touch
thicker
based
on
the
boldness
of
the
flavor
and
the
color
of
the
beer
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
the
lightness
of
the
beer
itself
coupled
with
the
great
balance
and
myriad
of
spices
makes
this
a
winner
of
a
winter
warmer
that
really
highlights
the
base
beer
not
sure
what
the
difference
is
between
this
one
and
the
other
one
but
this
is
the
bottle
and
abv
im
dealing
with
so
yeah
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
showing
only
the
slightest
tinge
of
translucence
topped
by
two
fingers
of
creamcolored
foam
the
nose
comprises
black
cherries
nutmeg
brown
sugar
chocolatecovered
strawberries
rye
bread
cinnamon
and
molasses
the
taste
holds
notes
of
brown
sugar
cinnamon
nutmeg
rye
bread
banana
bread
raspberries
maple
syrup
vanilla
peppercorns
red
grapes
red
apples
and
cashews
tastes
like
the
holidays
the
body
is
a
strong
medium
with
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
semichewy
feel
i
wish
it
were
the
holidays
more
often
ifn
it
meant
more
of
this
kind
o
beer
would
be
available
get
some
cant
wait
for
jolly
pumpkins
version
as
these
have
both
been
wonderful
brews
smell
of
bottled
holiday
spices
juniper
and
nutmeg
along
with
some
roasted
malt
beer
is
a
dark
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
thats
extremely
persistent
and
leaves
a
thick
residue
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
beer
has
a
light
body
and
a
residual
sweetness
offset
by
a
lingering
juniperpine
flavor
malt
is
apparent
in
mellow
roasted
chocolate
notes
while
tasty
i
personally
have
never
been
a
fan
of
juniper
and
that
is
a
key
flavor
in
this
beer
however
i
expect
a
good
deal
of
the
spices
have
mellowed
since
bottling
subtle
dryness
remains
and
allows
for
a
slow
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
hazy
cola
color
with
a
deep
foamy
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
nice

adds
a
creamy
smooth
feel
to
the
light
body
the
flavors
match
up
nicely
to
the
nose
a
real
nice
drinker
many
thanks
to
bmanning
for
this
opportunity
i
expected
the
spices
in
this
beer
to
be
more
prominent
and
i
suspected
that
they
must
have
mellowed
quickly
in
the
bottle
but
in
looking
at
other
recent
reviews
distinct
spices
were
noted
so
perhaps
the
shortcoming
lies
with
me
and
not
the
beer
cola
and
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
juniper
was
barely
perceived
as
a
light
piney
note
alcohol
well
integrated
and
lent
a
touch
of
pepper
d
my
favorite
of
the
series
so
far
is
the
jp
version
going
to
be
sour
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
d
i
find
winter
warmers
not
the
most
drinkable
style
but
for
style
this
does
well
recommended
if
you
happen
to
still
find
this
one
as
an
experiment
i
tried
placing
the
remaining
half
bottle
of
beer
in
the
fridge
for
a
bit
after
one
hour
open
in
you
drink
it
the
fridge
the
beer
seemed
to
have
more
sour
notes
but
other
flavors
were
more
muted
maybe
due
to
it
being
colder
still
getting
some
strong
flavor
like
anise
or
something
maybe
its
the
caraway
still
smooth
but
less
creamy
i
liked
it
better
closer
to
room
temperature
d
very
nice
drinking
experience
with
a
earthy
evergreen
flavor
makes
this
delightful
to
consume
to
many
holiday
ales
and
winters
try
to
overload
on
the
spice
rack
this
delivers
a
earthy
wintery
feel
that
seems
very
natural
at
8
5
it
drinks
more
like
a
6
5
a
special
collaboration
between
3
notable
breweries
comes
together
nicely
here
making
for
a
worthy
purchase
and
something
to
talk
about
first
things
first
i
love
the
label
really
appealing
for
some
reason
anyways
onto
the
brew
it
pours
a
nice
very
dark
kola
beer
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
lacing
here
and
therethe
aroma
is
like
a
spicy
fruitcake
with
hints
of
gingernutmegcinamon
and
nutsit
has
a
full
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
very
unique
taste
with
spicy
fruit
being
the
most
dominant
and
also
some
hints
of
boozy
expresso
yet
for
a
full
flavoured
brew
it
has
a
nice
easy
light
finish
and
is
very
moreish
and
even
though
you
can
taste
a
little
alcohol
after
the
first
few
sips
it
definately
dissapearswill
buy
this
again
whether
it
be
xmas
or
not
cheers
conclusion
this
is
a
beguiling
and
fascinating
winter
warmer
great
job
to
nogne
o
for
this
years
version
the
only
downside
is
that
its
really
too
crazy
complex
and
intense
to
make
it
something
id
want
all
the
time
still
one
of
the
best
spiced
winter
warmers
ive
had
yet
as
far
as
winter
warmers
go
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
the
flavor
of
the
8
50abv
is
hidden
very
well
but
it
definitely
has
a
nice
warming
sensation
to
it
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
drink
it
in
july
but
november
through
march
it
would
be
very
welcome
in
my
glass
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
high
dense
tan
head
that
leaves
just
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
juniper
cedar
malt
syrup
salted
potatoes
the
taste
is
toffee
juniper
collard
greens
pork
fat
itd
go
well
with
soul
food
its
thick
and
chewy
moderately
carbonated
goes
down
smooth
but
not
too
quickly
bravo
i
usually
dont
carego
for
the
winter
warmer
variety
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
this
allstar
collab
nailed
it
on
the
second
release
of
the
special
holiday
ale
a
delicious
beer
that
obviously
tilts
toward
the
sweetmalty
side
and
keeps
the
spices
in
check
poured
from
a
cellartemperature
bottle
into
a
goblet
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
tones
hard
to
see
through
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
is
unusual
and
complex
sweet
with
hints
of
juniper
rye
and
alcohol
as
well
as
other
things
i
cant
tease
out
flavor
is
roasted
malts
with
juniper
upfront
and
a
hint
of
coffee
and
chocolate
on
the
way
down
there
is
a
pleasant
heat
from
the
alcohol
and
a
lingering
sweetness
to
the
roasted
afterflavors
there
is
such
a
depth
of
flavor
that
i
feel
like
ive
only
skimmed
the
surface
but
ive
run
out
of
words
there
is
more
carbonation
than
is
apparent
from
the
appearance
and
it
carries
the
flavor
into
your
mouth
with
a
burst
this
brew
has
a
rich
mouthfeel
almost
creamy
its
delicious
and
drinkable
but
perhaps
not
more
than
one
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
gouden
carolus
chalice
it
has
a
dark
rubybrown
color
almost
like
a
glass
of
cola
there
is
a
modest
tan
foam
head
that
settled
down
to
a
skim
of
foam
no
light
can
penetrate
through
the
sides
of
the
glass
but
near
the
top
of
the
beer
some
light
filters
through
and
i
can
see
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
the
aroma
can
be
classified
and
spiced
malt
i
am
picking
up
nutmeg
sweet
candy
and
a
bit
of
juniper
its
very
interesting
it
has
a
big
roasted
malt
flavor
you
can
taste
the
rye
a
bit
of
the
nuttiness
from
the
chestnuts
it
also
has
a
touch
of
warm
alcohol
that
lingers
on
along
with
some
forestlike
flavors
probably
the
juniper
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
and
finishes
up
with
a
slight
coffee
bitterness
i
was
surprised
at
how
thick
this
beer
was
when
i
first
tasted
it
i
rolls
around
your
mouth
and
doesnt
want
to
leave
once
youve
swallowed
it
has
the
kind
of
body
that
demands
respect
and
attention
it
is
hearty
enough
to
earn
the
name
winter
warmer
despite
the
big
body
and
flavors
i
find
the
beer
to
be
quite
drinkable
at
no
point
do
the
spices
overwhelm
nor
does
the
abv
this
is
an
ideal
beverage
for
a
long
winters
night
highly
recommended
notes
a
very
interesting
beer
from
this
collaboration
definitely
winter
themed
with
all
the
spice
going
on
if
you
like
it
it
will
be
a
good
beer
but
still
not
great
if
that
distinct
flavor
isnt
youre
thing
you
may
hate
it
as
it
is
completely
dominant
throughout
the
aroma
and
smell
medium
to
full
body
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
i
wasnt
totally
sure
how
to
rate
this
one
theres
nothing
bad
about
it
really
but
it
does
feel
a
little
overspiced
at
times
so
i
would
say
it
is
very
good
just
not
over
the
top
spectacular
glad
i
tried
it
though
i
had
one
of
the
originalbrewings
of
this
beer
on
christmas
shortly
before
buying
this
one
i
knew
there
would
be
another
day
this
winter
i
would
need
a
winter
warmer
when
work
closed
early
due
to
snow
i
realized
it
was
today
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
the
best
i
can
describe
is
like
really
sharp
ginger
but
ginger
is
not
listed
on
the
bottle
as
being
a
spice
they
used
there
is
no
malt
or
hop
character
present
in
the
aroma
it
is
all
spice
very
simple
the
taste
is
more
balanced
than
the
aroma
in
that
there
is
some
malt
but
it
is
still
mostly
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
silky
moderately
carbonated
and
full
bodied
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
perhaps
might
be
really
good
if
left
to
age
for
a
couple
years
so
the
spice
could
mellow
out
i
had
the
holiday
collaboration
between
stonejolly
pumpkinnøgne
ø
last
year
supposedly
its
the
same
recipe
this
release
was
simply
brewed
at
nøgne
øs
facilities
rather
than
stones
i
recall
the
last
release
being
a
little
more
spicy
but
no
more
tasty
just
a
little
different
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
the
releases
are
very
similar
in
terms
of
quality
the
nose
could
use
just
a
little
more
strength
here
but
thats
about
it
the
flavor
is
good
its
unique
for
a
winter
warmer
not
what
youd
ordinarily
expect
i
like
it
if
you
see
a
bottle
still
around
pick
it
up
its
good
stuff
perhaps
jolly
pumpkin
will
do
the
honors
next
year
drinkability
the
booze
is
masked
well
i
hope
they
dont
stop
brewing
this
after
they
go
to
jp
next
year
this
is
definitely
better
than
last
years
stone
incarnation
a
great
winter
warmer
d
great
beer
very
pleasing
thoroughly
enjoyable
ive
been
seeing
more
nogne
o
beers
and
i
think
i
may
get
them
all
overall
it
was
good
to
try
but
half
a
glass
is
good
for
me
its
hard
to
finish
this
was
a
great
drink
given
how
little
i
like
holiday
beers
i
wanted
another
almost
immediately
after
killing
this
one
quintessential
holiday
ale
for
me
wouldnt
drink
it
every
day
but
perfect
for
a
few
once
a
year
treat
at
the
holidays
this
can
also
age
a
bit
which
should
be
an
interesting
drink
d
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
previous
reviews
say
that
this
beer
is
hot
but
i
think
that
now
this
beer
is
drinking
very
nicely
there
is
almost
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
a
pleasnant
medium
mouthfeel
for
an
8
5
beer
medium
bodied
beer
lots
of
spice
up
front
with
a
definite
roast
character
in
the
back
beer
is
a
little
hot
with
the
alcohol
second
taste
finishes
nicely
overall
pretty
drinkable
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
im
not
sure
i
would
get
it
again
but
im
learning
again
this
year
that
im
not
a
fan
of
the
winter
warmers
take
a
look
if
its
your
style
otherwise
skip
it
the
exquisite
taste
and
feel
here
add
up
to
very
high
drinkability
nogne
o
outdid
itself
with
this
one
its
also
clear
that
all
3
breweries
contributed
highquality
ingredients
this
is
a
great
beer
d
like
the
stone
brewed
beer
before
it
this
one
is
good
but
different
i
enjoy
it
for
the
creative
ingredients
and
being
able
to
make
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
definitely
one
of
those
winter
time
only
beers
d
i
am
not
of
fan
of
the
piney
and
bitterness
taste
not
sure
but
this
taste
a
bit
different
then
the
stone
version
i
actually
like
that
one
more
m
velvety
above
medium
bodied
sticky
and
coats
the
tongue
i
had
special
holiday
ale
after
a
burger
and
fries
on
new
years
eve
it
perfectly
washed
down
dinner
and
had
a
festive
feel
that
went
perfectly
with
the
occasion
d
this
was
another
great
christmas
beer
wonderfully
done
by
three
hard
hitters
of
the
brewing
world
medium
body
with
a
dry
finish
i
like
the
way
the
spices
dont
overpower
you
and
work
together
in
this
formula
makes
it
much
easier
to
drink
d
i
give
this
a
4
5
on
the
basis
of
holiday
drinkability
i
enjoyed
last
years
stone
based
offering
and
was
not
disappointed
by
this
years
while
it
is
similar
there
is
noticeable
difference
i
cant
wait
til
its
jps
turn
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
the
only
spiced
winter
beers
that
i
would
come
back
to
again
well
done
folks
d
this
beer
is
very
smooth
very
smooth
any
alcohol
noticeable
is
actually
nice
and
slightly
warming
glad
i
got
two
of
these
500ml
bottle
served
in
a
tank
7
tulip
bottle
conditioned
poured
a
dark
brown
with
about
two
fingers
of
tan
head
very
fragrant
juniper
spruce
eucalyptus
also
some
dark
malt
as
it
warms
medium
bodied
dark
fruit
chocolate
malt
and
more
spices
in
the
flavor
spruce
and
juniper
very
long
finish
of
spices
very
interesting
beer
if
you
like
anchor
osa
this
would
be
up
your
alley
you
wouldnt
want
to
make
a
night
of
it
but
fairly
drinkable
great
holiday
brew
drinkability
is
good
it
can
be
a
little
overwhelming
if
you
dont
dig
the
juniper
flavor
but
i
do
and
i
enjoyed
this
my
sample
was
gone
way
too
soon
edit
realize
now
that
i
posted
my
review
under
the
wrong
beer
hardly
surprising
given
the
various
collaborative
efforts
involving
these
breweries
and
so
have
now
moved
it
hard
keeping
track
drinkability
this
is
a
bold
flavored
beer
and
great
for
the
cold
weathe
but
one
bottle
is
enough
in
a
session
d
too
floral
to
be
highly
drinkable
very
smooth
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
too
many
herbs
get
in
the
way
of
this
one
d
this
release
is
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
it
could
have
used
just
a
bit
more
assertive
hopping
though
that
would
have
bumped
up
my
score
d
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
because
it
is
different
but
i
dont
think
it
is
outstanding
enough
to
purchase
again
worth
a
shot
though
j
i
think
this
is
a
tad
better
than
last
years
version
though
they
are
certainly
very
close
the
aroma
is
a
bit
spicy
for
me
but
the
taste
is
excellent
as
is
the
super
creamy
mouthfeel
creative
and
tasty
d
the
flavors
are
intense
though
not
that
complex
and
interesting
not
all
that
harsh
on
the
palate
overall
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
truly
is
a
winter
warmer
and
probably
the
best
ive
had
this
season
i
feel
ashamed
for
not
rating
the
last
many
beers
ive
had
so
i
start
again
here
the
mouthfeel
is
average
at
best
too
thin
and
overcarbonated
three
titans
of
brewing
worked
on
this
beer
but
give
me
a
jubelale
instead
still
a
pretty
good
beer
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
of
the
more
unusual
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
one
looks
really
pretty
to
me
nice
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
looks
good
holds
well
and
leaves
nice
lace
on
my
glass
sage
hits
me
first
in
the
nose
followed
by
juniper
and
sweet
nutty
toasty
goodness
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
of
all
of
the
above
which
comes
together
to
create
its
own
personality
forming
a
taste
that
reminds
me
of
the
candies
in
my
granmothers
house
that
had
a
really
odd
boozy
herbal
medicine
thing
going
on
with
them
the
things
going
on
in
this
beer
are
all
triggers
for
festive
christmas
time
moods
and
feelings
for
me
all
sliding
down
to
my
belly
on
a
slick
and
slightly
prickly
bed
of
beer
that
leaves
a
sagey
piney
fresh
herb
kiss
of
a
finish
that
really
lingers
in
a
kind
of
dry
way
nice
out
there
proper
all
said
and
done
this
could
be
like
my
anchor
tradition
one
a
year
to
get
me
in
the
mood
and
i
cant
wait
for
next
year
d
in
a
world
of
overspiced
winter
brews
this
one
is
a
nice
respite
still
spiced
but
not
to
much
they
did
not
just
throw
a
bunch
of
ingredients
into
a
beer
but
crafted
a
brew
that
utilized
all
the
ingredients
to
add
to
the
beer
what
results
is
a
well
produced
beer
that
yet
somehow
misses
feeling
spectacular
yet
i
cant
seem
to
pinpoint
why
overall
if
you
like
a
sweet
beer
its
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
offering
enjoy
overly
chocolates
unexpected
chocolate
overwhelms
other
flavors
looks
very
nice
cant
see
it
pairing
will
with
food
wont
likely
but
again
prost
lampertland
very
sweet
chocolate
smell
that
lasts
to
the
end
of
drinking
fairly
smooth
comparing
to
other
ales
i
think
nice
ruby
or
copper
colour
pleasant
feeling
until
the
last
drop
beautiful
chocolate
flavor
perfect
for
midday
skiing
o
o
love
this
beer
chocolate
notes
come
through
very
vanilla
nice
nothing
special
enjoying
this
one
during
the
first
snow
of
the
year
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
with
heavy
caramel
notes
i
think
it
could
handle
a
bit
more
of
a
hoppy
kick
to
balance
the
sweetness
nonetheless
it
was
enjoyable
and
lived
up
to
being
a
winter
warmer
every
beer
has
its
proper
place
this
one
is
in
my
mouth
surprisingly
delicious
o
im
not
sure
i
like
this
quite
as
much
as
i
did
last
year
when
i
was
first
drinking
it
but
i
suppose
the
good
beer
becomes
separated
from
the
truly
great
beer
the
more
beer
you
try
overall
very
good
winter
warmer
probably
my
favorite
ive
had
this
season
can
realistically
see
my
self
picking
up
another
can
or
two
of
this
during
the
holiday
season
had
on
tap
at
a
calgary
pub
in
the
ne
same
place
i
have
sampled
a
few
other
granville
island
offerings
this
rather
sweet
brew
looks
the
part
of
a
winter
beer
a
pleasing
dark
red
amber
to
brown
with
around
an
inch
of
tan
head
looks
like
a
classic
english
porter
does
not
taste
like
a
classic
english
porter
smells
like
milk
chocolate
and
vanilla
a
candy
bar
in
a
pint
glass
tastes
much
the
same
milk
chocolate
vanilla
carob
caramel
and
a
nutty
flavor
a
bit
like
pecans
i
get
some
red
fruit
and
raisin
or
plum
notes
as
well
i
often
enjoy
this
sort
of
dessert
beer
but
unfortunately
this
one
became
cloying
and
unpleasant
about
halfway
through
a
pint
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
but
the
body
is
a
little
too
light
and
crisp
for
what
should
be
a
sipper
has
the
body
of
a
session
ale
but
tastes
a
lot
darker
and
sweeter
than
any
such
beer
there
are
some
flaws
including
an
unpleasant
saccharine
sweetness
that
does
not
taste
natural
despite
the
fact
that
allnatural
ingredients
are
used
what
seems
like
oxidation
manifesting
as
wet
cardboard
and
an
odd
melding
of
leafy
aromatic
flavors
with
the
dark
malts
to
produce
a
mint
chocolate
chip
vibe
that
became
way
too
dominant
on
the
palate
it
was
all
i
could
taste
after
a
while
not
sure
what
the
fix
would
be
perhaps
less
emphasis
on
the
spiceflavoring
component
so
that
the
malts
can
do
the
work
of
making
things
rich
and
chocolatey
without
the
need
for
so
many
sweet
tooth
histrionics
reminds
me
off
a
lighter
poor
mans
ayinger
celebrator
doppelbock
nicely
done

d
flavours
could
be
more
prominent
and
mouthfeel
is
lacking
a
bit
but
overall
still
a
decent
winter
ale
this
would
actually
be
a
good
gateway
winter
ale
to
introduce
to
those
just
getting
into

and
some

of

with

quite
interesting

is
also
a

between
some

is
about

with

easily

warmer

beer
with
just
enough
complexity
final
thoughts
well
this
beer
tastes
like
christmas
simply
put
and
like
christmas
it
is
good
it
only
comes
around
once
a
year
the
good
outweighs
the
bad
here
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
one
pleasant
ale
that
reminds
me
of
christmas
deep
brownish
red
with
a
thick
creamy
two
finger
head
this
beer
is
a
beauty
to
behold
smells
of
banana
bread
malts
caramel
vanilla
and
winter
fruits
tastes
delicious
big
bold
malts
bready
character
strong
hint
of
vanilla
some
banana
and
plums
mouthfeel
is
velvety
and
smooth
too
bad
im
having
this
during
the
spring
british
columbias
lions
winter
ale
is
kind
of
a
reflection
of
where
its
brewed
it
would
be
a
great
pint
to
share
with
friends
after
a
mild
day
on
the
slopes
but
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
and
complexity
to
support
a
long
night
of
solitary
innerreflection
in
the
midst
of
a
dark
dead
frostbound
environment
very
tasty
stuff
but
buy
accordingly
good
beer
that
is
easily
found
at
government
stores
and
many
privates
not
worth
writing
home
about
but
definitely
worth
having
a
few
of
o
good
malty
delicious
balanced
good
beer
my
first
by
granville
island
and
was
glad
to
find
it
at
an
lcbo
in
ontario
would
like
to
try
more
by
them
but
theyre
hard
to
find
out
here
still
maintain
that
this
can
at
times
be
offensively
sweet
once
it
develops
it
does
show
some
other
interesting
elements
it
cries
out
for
balance
though
and
while
a
decent
winter
beer
i
wouldnt
say
youre
missing
much
if
you
give
it
a
pass
unless
caramel
beers
are
your
thing
all
in
all
a
winter
warmer
id
recommend
and
a
vanillalovers
dream
my
compliments
to
granville
island
and
i
hope
molson
continues
to
allow
them
brewing
autonomy
o
a
nice
winter
ale
its
a
little
weak
overall
but
as
an
easy
to
drink
beer
with
flavour
its
there
overall
not
too
shabby
it
has
a
little
something
taste
wise
for
everyone
i
can
see
this
working
well
as
a
good
gateway
beer
to
get
into
craft
not
something
id
buy
another
can
of
but
id
probably
get
a
pint
on
tap
if
i
saw
it
at
a
bar
overall
very
nice
its
a
very
drinkable
sweet
winter
beer
balanced
but
singleminded
pours
clear
root
beer
brown
overpowering
sugared
scent
leaves
room
for
little
else
candied
infusion
of
vanilla
overpowers
without
overwhelming
but
prevents
whatever
faint
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
maltshops
to
that
exist
to
develop
with
any
meaning
flavour
quickly
disappears
with
no
aftertaste
novelty
ale
with
little
enduring
seasonal
value
final
grade
3
67
a
serviceable
b
grade
granville
islands
lions
winter
ale
is
a
highly
quaffable
enjoyable
little
warmer
in
its
own
right
but
what
it
comes
down
to
is
this
if
someone
gave
this
to
me
blindfolded
i
seriously
might
mistake
it
for
vanilla
coke
or
cream
soda
and
for
that
reason
i
really
cant
take
it
seriously
this
isnt
the
greatest
winter
beer
in
the
world
but
its
still
a
charming
brew
with
far
more
drinkability
than
the
average
warmer
of
the
granville
brews
ive
tried
this
is
easily
the
best
and
probably
the
only
one
i
would
seriously
consider
recommending
to
others
or
repurchasing
o
this
is
something
great
for
the
holidays
i
wish
it
had
more
body
and
perhaps
a
bit
more
breadbiscuit
flavours
to
it
or
even
batter
some
smokiness
to
it
but
those
are
only
my
opinions
this
is
going
well
with
fruit
cake
ambercopper
colour
one
finger
of
dense
white
head
good
amount
of
lace
here
as
well
too
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
vanilla
and
spices
caramel
toffee
a
subtle
roast
malt
profile
as
well
as
some
chocolate
present
taste
is
spicy
and
lightly
sweet
vanilla
with
bits
of
toffee
chocolate
and
roast
were
more
pleasant
on
the
nose
than
on
the
palate
bit
of
bready
flavours
with
a
light
bitterness
medium
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
not
a
bad
beer
and
something
i
apreciate
compared
to
some
other
spice
bomb
winter
ales
a
bit
lackluster
however
but
still
a
good
drink
i
have
to
say
i
did
like
this
brew
which
is
a
surprise
for
me
with
granville
i
happen
to
like
vanilla
a
great
deal
so
that
helped
but
in
general
it
was
more
balanced
than
i
thought
it
would
be
overall
decent
but
not
something
i
would
want
often
i
am
a
big
vanilla
fan
which
probably
helped
but
i
dont
think
it
is
done
particularly
well
in
this
beer
golden
brown
in
colour
offwhite
head
only
a
ring
of
retention
persists
no
lacing
nose
is
full
of
vanilla
perhaps
slightly
artificial
in
tone
some
cocoa
brown
sugar
and
nuts
as
well
taste
is
lightly
nutty
more
breadiness
caramel
cocoa
and
vanilla
carbonation
is
a
bit
higher
than
id
like
but
a
few
swirls
of
the
glass
took
it
down
to
a
manageable
level
fairly
thin
however
and
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
in
the
finish
nose
is
quite
nice
but
palate
doesnt
live
up
to
it
i
thought
this
couldve
been
a
lot
better
with
some
more
body
and
mouthfeel
d
pretty
good
stuff
and
certainly
a
better
brew
than
my
memory
had
me
believe
really
easy
to
drink
with
a
sweet
and
malty
profile
making
it
perfect
for
the
chilly
holiday
season
od
very
nice
spice
which
was
subtle
but
mixed
well
with
other
elements
rich
malt
and
nice
hops
in
a
winter
beer
good
stuff
overall
a
pleasant
winter
warmer
from
gib
the
vanilla
flavour
was
very
nicely
showcased
and
was
wellbalanced
this
ale
would
be
even
better
if
some
spices
were
thrown
in
perhaps
clove
or
nutmeg
would
definitely
buy
again
cheers
overall
very
drinkable
the
vanilla
is
really
the
key
here
it
is
what
makes
it
as
palatable
as
it
is
i
most
likely
will
order
again
next
time
i
am
at
the
pub
that
offers
this
beer
seeing
as
its
the
best
one
on
tap
i
will
order
it
soon
especially
if
i
am
having
a
dessert
presumably
it
tastes
better
because
its
more
fresh
its
only
available
in
the
fall
so
theoretically
its
been
brewed
more
recently
o
a
very
tasty
beer
that
while
considered
a
winter
warmer
im
finding
quite
enjoyable
on
a
summer
evening
the
alcohol
isnt
super
strong
to
begin
with
but
it
is
very
well
hidden
behind
all
the
sweetness
id
have
no
problem
having
several
of
these
in
an
eveningafternoon
i
do
recommend
this
one
and
will
pick
this
up
again
when
in
season
im
in
the
same
boat
as
the
previous
review
had
this
one
maturing
for
some
time
my
wife
picked
it
up
for
me
i
thought
i
knew
what
id
be
getting
but
im
quite
happy
with
the
surprise
i
ended
up
with
o
thank
you
rutager
for
this
brewquite
the
experience
i
have
put
this
brew
off
for
sometime
now
because
i
always
looked
at
it
and
thought
to
myself
i
already
know
what
that
tastes
like
never
have
i
ever
been
so
wrong
the
aroma
got
me
thinking
real
quick
im
in
for
it
the
character
of
this
beer
stands
out
a
lot
to
me
and
while
im
not
loving
it
i
am
liking
it
and
also
can
see
how
could
this
may
be
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
drinkability
a
pretty
good
drinker
goes
down
easy
due
to
it
being
a
bit
watery
and
not
too
sweet
i
first
tasted
this
ale
after
a
day
of
riding
at
mt
seymour
it
was
on
tap
and
was
an
exceptional
winter
ale
as
ive
said
this
ale
is
all
about
vanilla
and
although
some
may
frown
at
that
i
embrace
it
as
it
is
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
winter
months
i
have
since
drank
this
winter
ale
in
bottle
form
and
cant
get
enough
of
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
winter
beer
the
overtly
vanilla
and
caramel
taste
helps
it
stand
out
over
other
beers
should
give
it
a
try
when
its
available
d
i
like
this
winter
warmer
because
the
flavours
are
mild
enough
that
you
could
enjoy
several
in
one
sitting
definitely
a
tasty
offering
from
ganville
and
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
d
an
interesting
mix
of
aroma
and
flavour
the
winter
warmer
spice
is
there
but
not
over
the
top
as
so
many
seem
to
be
one
could
likely
enough
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
lions
winter
ale
is
a
blood
red
beer
vanilla
dominates
the
nose
with
a
milk
chocolateliness
to
it
this
carries
over
to
the
taste
of
the
beer
toffee
is
subtly
present
in
the
background
through
out
the
low
carbonation
leads
to
an
incredible
smooth
beer
with
a
solid
medium
body
there
is
a
residual
cloying
sweetness
in
the
finish
has
a
lightmedium
body
and
good
carbonation
d
the
flavors
seem
very
artificial
and
remind
me
of
name
brand
snackspop
the
finish
has
a
chemical
taste
and
mouthfeel
like
cola
good
but
not
great
worth
drinking
good
flavor
going
on
but
i
think
you
can
get
better
winter
ales
with
little
effort
with
no
appreciable
warming
from
the
tweak
of
extra
alcohol
this
is
a
nice
mild
winter
sipper
less
spiced
than
many
of
its
seasonal
brethren
and
another
agreeable
choice
for
those
occasions
when
a
sixpack
is
the
order
of
the
day
a
wonderful
reddish
copper
color
but
the
head
faded
quickly
the
malt
aroma
was
predominant
really
no
hops
were
noticed
i
found
the
flavour
very
surprising
the
malt
just
jumped
out
and
grabbed
my
palate
the
hops
were
so
far
in
the
background
i
didnt
detect
them
at
first
all
in
all
a
very
caramel
taste
that
just
seemed
right
for
my
liking
after
the
first
pint
i
had
a
few
plates
of
various
flavoured
chicken
wings
but
the
malt
just
kept
right
up
with
the
various
types
of
wings
a
dense
body
best
describes
the
mouthfeel
i
could
have
certainly
had
a
few
more
if
my
much
better
half
said
it
was
time
to
head
back
to
our
condo
ill
certainly
try
this
beer
again
and
again
this
beer
is
definately
not
retired
seasonal
for
sure
but
its
back
in
full
force
for
200607
pours
out
to
a
flat
brown
auburn
color
with
a
small
head
of
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
no
lace
low
carbonation
aromas
of
raisins
grainy
caramel
and
roasted
malts
taste
was
a
bit
bland
but
notes
of
grains
malt
and
mild
dark
fruits
were
noted
mouthfeel
was
far
too
flat
and
boring
drinkability
is
not
up
to
par
thanks
to
derek
for
the
12
oz
sample
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
if
i
could
ever
find
it
d
good
should
appeal
to
the
general
public
if
theyre
feeling
a
little
aventurous
indy
o
this
is
the
2005
version
and
i
must
say
that
the
often
overpowering
vanilla
notes
are
moved
to
the
back
the
beer
is
creamier
and
more
assertive
in
its
flavour
of
hops
i
will
start
buying
this
as
thankfully
the
sickly
vanilla
esters
are
only
a
small
part
of
the
makeup
similar
flavor
profile
but
not
as
sticky
sweet
as
i
remember
the
bottled
version
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
medium
brownred
colour
with
good
head
and
good
lacing
smells
like
light
malts
and
vanilla
smells
really
good
its
subtle
but
still
strong
just
have
to
try
it
to
understand
the
taste
is
vanilla
as
well
with
some
bitterness
kind
of
tastes
like
beer
cream
soda
i
really
really
like
it
very
smooth
could
see
anyone
slamming
these
back
very
tasting
and
refreshing
and
not
really
like
any
other
beer
ive
tasted
very
recommended
nothing
wrong
with
any
of
the
other
brews
either
a
worthy
purchase
a
winter
seasonal
by
granville
island
bc
the
appearance
is
average
a
popfizz
head
which
is
light
brown
and
did
not
last
long
the
beer
is
reddishamber
with
some
orange
thin
lace
clear
but
not
transparent
liquid
the
aroma
immediately
reminded
me
of
coke
and
vanilla
buttery
definite
maple
syrup
dark
candied
malt
some
grainy
treebark
even
pine
aromas
nuts
and
root
beer
a
definite
pop
smell
to
it
cinammon
and
tree
resin
the
bottle
itself
states
there
is
vanilla
in
the
taste
and
aroma
and
it
is
true
vanilla
is
extremely
evident
in
the
taste
almost
precisely
this
beer
resembles
the
aroma
there
is
a
decent
hop
dryness
but
a
finish
of
cardboard
or
wood
which
leaves
a
dry
feeling
i
dislike
the
finish
it
is
a
little
cloyingly
syrupy
on
the
tongue
a
little
lacking
in
balance
somehow
predominantly
malty
brew
this
beer
starts
off
nicely
with
a
fruitysweet
smell
and
a
vanilla
taste
up
front
but
there
is
an
undesirable
feeling
left
in
the
mouth
almost
as
if
this
beer
has
been
stored
improperly
i
have
nothing
good
to
say
about
this
beer
ive
had
a
couple
of
bottles
before
and
tend
to
like
it
less
each
time
pours
out
of
its
341
ml
brown
bottle
a
clear
burnished
copper
hue
but
seems
a
bit
watery
right
from
the
start
which
is
typical
for
granville
island
from
my
exerience
thin
fizzle
of
beige
head
with
little
retention
things
pick
up
on
the
aroma
dense
caramel
malt
chocolate
wafers
rounded
out
with
vanilla
bean
very
appealing
the
flavour
starts
out
a
little
thin
light
grainy
malt
but
starts
picking
up
momentum
in
the
middle
that
malty
wafer
flavour
appears
along
with
the
dry
cocao
which
carries
to
the
finish
where
there
is
some
slight
vanilla
waiting
to
join
the
party
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
ive
taken
this
to
be
the
standard
that
granville
island
aims
for
the
texture
of
the
finish
is
rather
quite
dry
and
wafery
which
i
find
unique
for
a
winter
ale
but
i
like
it
its
pretty
much
an
easy
drinking
flavourful
ale
to
offer
guests
at
seasonal
shindigs
who
are
less
prone
to
drinking
heavier
porters
or
stouts
or
dark
belgians
color
is
much
darker
than
i
expected
smell
is
pretty
faint
but
getting
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
maybe
some
dark
fruits
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
caramel
brown
sugar
chocolate
and
spices
but
with
a
bit
of
roast
in
the
finish
medium
body
light
to
medium
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
but
not
something
i
would
necessarily
seek
out
this
brew
actually
pours
a
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
areas
of
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
ends
up
sliding
back
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
after
a
while
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
like
in
a
stout
with
some
cocoa
powder
pretty
much
the
same
is
said
for
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
mediumbodied
with
low
carbonation
which
is
perfect
for
this
type
of
brew
very
smooth
and
tasty
brew
for
the
colder
months
o

pretty
ordinary
dark
beer
reminds
me
of
the
early
90s
microbrew
scene
before
people
starting
doing
interesting
stuff
over
all
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
think
it
was
pretty
well
in
line
with
the
style
it
is
not
the
best
winter
style
beer
i
have
had
but
i
went
back
and
some
more
when
i
finished
my
first
six
pack
i
would
drink
this
again
at
any
time
pours
dark
slightly
amber
in
color
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
is
nutty
and
of
red
wine
and
it
tastes
of
fruit
spice
and
licorice
but
more
so
of
malt
roasted
carbonation
is
mild
to
moderate
with
and
the
overall
feel
is
light
complex
flavors
yet
very
drinkable
o
this
is
more
of
a
spicier
version
of
a
dubbel
but
very
very
tasty
spices
used
sparingly
if
at
all
which
make
this
a
fine
winter
warmer
in
my
book
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
quite
warming
very
delightful
a
complex
yet
smooth
and
easytodrink
winter
warmer
this
is
just
right
for
a
cold
evening
actually
one
of
points
better
efforts
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
large
foamy
fizzy
light
tan
head
that
soon
settled
to
a
large
island
and
ring
with
a
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
orange
red
mahoganey
with
lots
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
immediately
bubble
gum
then
fruit
malt
caramel
flavor
is
like
nose
with
sweet
on
top
then
bitter
and
tang
not
a
lot
going
on
body
is
a
tad
thin
and
carbonation
fizzy
finish
is
like
flavor
fairly
long
and
lelt
me
thinking
i
know
they
can
do
it
if
they
want
the
question
is
why
dont
they
the
feel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
a
snappy
crispness
and
is
fairly
smooth
though
it
might
be
a
touch
too
active
overall
i
thought
saint
benedicts
winter
ale
was
a
decent
beer
had
it
for
the
first
time
at
my
girlfriends
cabin
in
northern
wisconsin
back
in
late
december
of
2012
the
appearance
of
the
beer
was
good
and
the
flavor
was
ok
i
thought
it
was
kind
of
a
strong
beer
at
times
with
the
full
flavor
coming
out
at
times
would
probably
buy
it
again
in
the
winter
months
o
not
as
good
as
i
remember
from
a
few
years
back
the
cherries
are
a
bit
strong
still
not
bod
pours
clear
amber
with
little
head
smells
similar
to
a
belgian
but
is
not
quite
as
complex
has
a
surprisingly
warm
and
pleasant
taste
for
how
inexpensive
it
was
it
is
not
a
heavy
beer
but
does
have
a
warm
feel
a
respectable
winter
beer
at
a
very
reasonable
price
this
is
pretty
good
though
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
definitely
perfect
for
winter
o
not
sure
if
it
fits
the
winter
ale
characteristics
it
claims
to
be
but
an
excellent
take
on
a
belgian
a
very
well
balanced
tasty
brew
tastenutmeg
cinnamon
clove
some
dark

mills
about
a
bit
lightbodied
for
a
winter
warmer
despite
the
6
2abv
a
decent
bit
betterthan
average
wintwer
warmer
o
a
surprise
to
say
the
least
from
stevens
point
did
not
figure
this
to
be
a
belgian
ale
prior
to
opening
the
bottle
reminds
me
of
leffe
brown
o
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
isnt
very
filling
overall
one
of
the
best
american
belgians
ive
had
i
know
ba
follows
the
label
and
calls
this
a
winter
ale
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
this
is
a
superb
tasty
wellbalanced
and
easytodrink
beer

somewhat
smooth
medium
body
with
an
understated
carbonation
oi
paired
this
with
pizza
rolls
which
did
not
work
well
this
would
work
well
with
red
meat
i
think
as
well
as
by
itself
very
likely
that
i
will
purchase
this
next
winter
oi
feel
this
is
on
the
verge
of
being
better
than
average
i
want
to
like
it
more
but
as
i
am
discerning
i
keep
wanting
more
assertive
flavors
to
jump
out
they
dont
still
not
bad
at
all
reddish
brown
color
with
a
very
slight
head
the
aroma
is
maltcentric
a
lots
of
toasted
bready
notes
some
syruplike
scents
mingled
with
fruit
the
taste
is
equally
malty
with
apple
pear
and
some
bitterness
balance
however
is
tilted
severely
toward
malt
moderately
low
in
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
a
little
lighter
than
the
taste
telegraphs
its
still
a
flavorful
and
good
winter
warmer
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
light
ruby
color
with
a
whitish
tan
bubbly
head
that
dissapears
right
away
smells
faintly
of
mixed
berries
and
wheat
with
an
almost
estery
belgian
note
to
it
similar
to
bananas
it
tastes
very
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
slight
hop
kick
while
maintaining
a
distinct
sweetness
very
balanced
with
both
malts
and
hops
has
a
crispy
syrupy
mouth
feel
that
is
very
enjoyable
overall
a
great
winter
warmer
not
very
spicy
and
not
too
dark
but
still
clean
and
drinkable
i
would
pick
up
some
of
these
up
and
share
the
6er
with
friends
overall
for
whatever
reason
stevens
point
brewery
was
a
company
i
had
stayed
away
from
for
a
long
time
i
hadnt
necessarily
heard
anything
negative
but
i
had
incorrectly
made
an
assumption
that
they
were
only
capable
of
making
mediocre
craft
beers
well
i
guess
i
have
to
drink
my
words
because
this
is
a
great
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
sure
its
not
that
pretty
and
it
doesnt
adhere
strictly
to
the
winter
warmer
characteristics
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
this
is
a
plain
good
beer
onothing
that
i
would
seek
out
again
i
just
wasnt
fond
of
the
spice
that
i
got
out
of
it
o
this
is
kind
of
an
odd
unfocused
beer
it
almost
plays
like
a
cross
between
a
winter
warmer
and
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
it
cant
pull
either
off
o
overall
not
too
bad
i
enjoyed
this
and
i
will
definitely
look
forward
to
it
next
year
this
is
nice
and
a
bit
different
for
the
winter
warmer
category
it
seemed
at
times
to
not
be
entirely
coherent
but
the
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
help
tie
things
together
nice
for
meaty
meals
pours
amber
in
color
with
maybe
some
ruby
hi
lites
very
little
carbonation
and
even
less
foamy
head
aroma
of
malts
bread
and
nuts
some
light
hops
malty
tasting
with
biscuit
and
alight
hop
bitterness
drinks
semi
smooth
with
a
touch
of
grit
this
beer
is
just
an
average
beer
and
really
could
use
alittle
work
this
tastes
like
what
happens
when
you
try
to
make
a
dubbel
and
undercalculate
something
in
the
process
nothing
huge
here
though
it
still
works
i
wouldnt
stab
anybody
for
it
but
its
nowhere
near
a
drain
pour
either
i
imagine
its
an
entry
level
for
the
warmer
category
o
this
was
odd
for
me
for
the
most
part
it
was
ok
but
they
got
a
little
carried
away
with
the
whole
phenolester
thing
in
the
finish
probably
pass
in
the
future
sampled
on
december
3
2011
the
pour
is
a
medium
to
dark
amber
almost
chestnut
with
slow
moving
upward
carbonation
and
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
spirited
with
dark
malts
sugar
clean
light
hops
and
black
licorice
the
body
has
a
smooth
creamy
feel
to
it
and
it
falls
in
the
medium
range
roasted
malts
are
up
front
in
the
flavor
with
a
mellow
balance
of
hops
yeast
and
maybe
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
an
entirely
satisfying
winter
warmer
not
too
spiced
but
basically
balanced
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
inclusion
is
present
with
a
warmth
expected
for
the
6
indicated
as
previously
stated
this
brew
is
a
bit
of
a
jumbled
mess
without
enough
malt
backbone
the
peppery
spice
and
clove
are
very
exaggerated
i
am
appreciative
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
on
two
different
occasions
at
the
cost
of
someone
else
and
honestly
both
times
i
struggled
to
finish
my
glass
this
one
is
not
worth
seeking
out
o
i
would
call
it
a
tie
the
k9
cruiser
winter
ale
looks
nicer
but
this
one
tastes
and
feels
better
pours
a
slightly
red
transparent
color
with
a
solid
2
inch
white
head
smells
like
the
holidays
with
a
big
malt
body
and
a
red
berry
sweetness
taste
is
a
bit
more
hop
driven
than
than
nose
indicates
and
althought
not
a
fruity
or
spicy
beer
it
has
elements
of
both
good
carbonation
and
went
fantastic
with
thanksgiving
dinner
enjoyed
them
all
day
with
the
turkey
smoking
away
on
the
weber
in
fact
one
of
the
more
sessionable
winters
ive
had
purchased
as
part
of
a
mystery
pack
from
u
pick
6
beer
in
erie
pa
not
as
many
spice
notes
as
other
christmas
ales
i
have
had
other
reviewers
have
commented
on
the
brown
sugar
notes
think
i
taste
them
i
like
this
beer
the
mouth
feel
was
nice
not
heavy
overall
good
beer
i
will
buy
this
again
when
available
pours
a
cloudy
redorange
color
with
a
little
and
quickly
disolving
head
there
is
a
slight
scent
of
malts
and
some
spices
but
nothing
that
sticks
out
too
much
taste
is
rather
strong
and
dull
starts
with
a
nice
spice
taste
but
ends
with
a
dry
rustic
taste
texture
is
a
little
watery
as
well
after
a
few
sips
you
get
used
to
the
taste
but
still
has
many
flaws
slighty
disappointed
but
this
one
i
hope
the
other
5
beers
are
better
than
this
sam
adams
winter
lager
is
by
far
a
better
tasting
winter
warmer
than
this
point
st
benedicts
winter
ale
is
a
slightly
hazy
copper
ale
with
a
yellowish
head
that
fades
to
a
waxy
film
and
leaves
outstanding
lacing
on
the
glass
fruit
and
spice
are
in
the
aroma
with
notes
of
cinnamon
pear
and
allspice
there
is
the
slightest
hint
of
caramel
it
has
a
very
soft
and
delicate
medium
body
it
feels
fluffy
in
the
mouth
and
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
a
little
gritty
wow
this
is
like
a
belgian
dark
ale
the
flavor
is
complex
with
a
lot
of
deep
and
dark
tones
cinnamon
and
wood
there
is
a
fruity
note
which
is
a
little
like
apricot
or
cherry
it
doesnt
really
taste
sweet
though
roasted
bitterness
lingers
after
the
swallow
wow
this
is
a
really
good
winter
ale
even
in
spring
this
is
a
very
rewarding
beer

the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
stevens
point
d
incredible
drinkability
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
the
abv
isnt
too
bad
either
goes
down
so
easy
and
is
just
a
purely
enjoyable
beer
d
ugh
drinkable
in
the
sense
of
smoothness
but
not
in
flavor
okay
im
not
a
big
winter
warmer
fan
so
im
probably
harder
on
the
style
than
is
necessary
the
flavor
of
this
one
is
appealing
to
me
but
its
just
not
quite
fantastic
would
be
okay
to
session
a
few
though
they
go
down
easy
enough
not
as
cloying
as
some
wws
so
theres
that
d
easy
enough
drinkability
but
limited
and
moderate
appeal
very
safe
and
middle
of
the
road
flavor
will
warrant
little
complaint
though
little
praise
as
well
a
six
pack
will
probably
get
boring
halfway
through
single
purchase
recommended
d
easy
to
drink
cant
say
its
amazing
but
its
pretty
decent
d
not
something
i
would
track
down
again
but
it
was
a
fairly
good
winter
ale
warmer
as
always
could
use
more
spice
and
maybe
a
less
hop
forward
base
overall
very
decent
pours
a
bright
ruby
tinted

and
leaves
behind

unnatural

to

something
i
wouldnt
drink
on
the
regular
drinkability
is
rough
it
shows
promise
from
point
brewery
to
do
something
a
little
outside
the
norm
from
a
regional
brewery
that
big
st
benedicts
appears
a
bit
viscous
as
i
pour
it
into
my
glass
well
see
if
thats
really
the
case
it
brought
up
a
thick
head
of
frothy
tan
foam
which
settles
in
a
minute
or
so
spots
of
lace
are
left
about
the
glass
its
a
slightly
hazy
crimsontinted
copper
with
glowing
orange
highlights
the
aroma
is
interesting
i
find
it
fruity
and
somewhat
spicy
im
thinking
dark
fruits
like
plum
and
raisin
maybe
cassis
theres
some
darkly
caramelish
malt
and
cooked
brown
sugar
beneath
that
as
i
drink
it
however
the
lacing
diminishes
oh
well
to
the
lips
we
go
fruit
and
malt
combine
at
the
front
and
as
it
warms
i
find
banana
and
clove
theres
not
a
lot
but
its
there
across
the
middle
it
dries
and
a
spice
component
appears
it
rises
in
the
finish
but
notes
of
malt
and
then
fruit
are
still
there
leaving
it
fairly
interesting
and
complex
wow
it
really
is
a
bit
viscous
its
mediumfull
in
body
and
quite
creamy
as
the
carbonation
is
released
back
to
the
flavor
i
really
like
the
combination
of
fruit
and
malt
at
the
outset
its
well
combined
and
the
specific
fruitiness
that
i
found
in
the
nose
isnt
there
its
more
generic
wether
thats
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
i
dont
know
were
not
comparing
it
to
any
particular
style
or
other
beer
hedonistically
i
like
it
and
i
also
like
the
way
the
spiciness
gently
builds
across
the
palate
until
it
becomes
most
apparent
in
the
dry
finish
and
not
unlike
the
fruitiness
the
spicing
isnt
quite
clear
either
i
could
guess
at
whats
there
but
its
not
readily
apparent
and
in
your
face
perhaps
its
just
a
pinch
of
cinnamon
perhaps
its
just
clove
and
phenolic
from
the
yeast
personally
i
find
that
a
good
thing
it
leaves
you
guessing
i
think
theyve
done
a
nice
job
of
blending
to
get
a
nice
mix
that
works
and
theyve
kept
it
restrained
enough
that
the
spicing
doesnt
build
on
the
palate
ruining
the
beer
for
you
half
way
through
sure
the
first
couple
of
sips
of
a
really
spicy
beer
can
be
great
but
then
you
lose
interest
as
it
builds
on
your
palate
and
blocks
out
the
other
flavors
this
one
is
balanced
enough
that
it
remains
focused
and
drinkable
based
on
that
i
have
to
give
it
some
really
good
marks
for
drinkability
and
since
i
dont
find
any
faults
here
id
have
to
say
its
an
excellent
winter
warmer
nicely
done
i
had
this
with
pork
at
christmas
dinner
and
it
was
a
great
pairing
an
ok
brew
some
decent
belgian
flavors
mixed
with
a
so
so
english
base
overall
i
dont
necessarily
find
this
to
be
a
winter
warmer
it
is
more
similar
to
fat
tire
than
anything
that
carries
that
label
as
winter
warmers
tend
to
be
flavored
with
various
spices
mainly
cinnamon
also
similar
to
fat
tire
this
is
a
beer
that
one
could
easily
finish
a
six
pack
of
like
many
others
wondering
where
the
spice
flavor
is
in
this
beer
to
make
it
a
winter
ale
there
is
the
slightest
bit
on
the
nose
and
in
the
finish
though
other
than
that
this
remains
a
dryly
sweet
brown
not
anything
special
but
not
terrible
either
sometimes
you
need
an
average
beer
right
lighter
body
with
soft
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
not
sure
why
this
is
called
a
winter
warmer
not
very
interesting
drinkability
ok
a
disclaimer
i
consumed
a
samuel
smiths
winter
warmer
prior
to
drinking
this
sample
maybe
my
palate
hadnt
recalibrated
but
this
beer
tastes
like
somebody
really
didnt
give
a
crap
about
carefully
crafting
a
winter
beer
seriously
did
the
brewmaster
decide
to
throw
a
carton
of
marlboros
in
the
mash
tun
and
pass
it
off
for
smoking
the
beer
there
are
some
redeeming
qualities
the
color
the
finish
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
even
at
99cbottle
at
my
local
beer
shop
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
thin
head
not
much
retention
but
a
decent
amount
of
laceing
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
and
sugary
malts
body
is
thick
and
lightly
carbonated
taste
is
of
brown
sugar
carmel
and
dark
sweet
fruit
solid
finish
worth
a
try
this
season
drinkability
slow
sipping
winter
beer
the
spiciness
keeps
this
from
having
more
than
one
in
a
session
not
bad
but
nothing
exciting
for
me
not
as
much
depth
malt
or
spice
as
i
had
hoped
will
probably
stick
to
the
belgian
dubels
and
quads
notes
pretty
malty
beer
that
is
pretty
sweet
didnt
really
amaze
me
but
just
a
simple
drinking
beer
drinkability
pretty
decent
brew
and
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
nice
clear
dark
copper
amber
with
a
small
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
some
sweet
spices
and
fruitiness
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
some
breadiness
sweet
spices
and
some
light
hops
palate
is
med
to
full
body
nice
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
caramel
malt
some
breadiness
and
yeast
ending
with
a
dry
alcohol
sweet
vanilla
bitternes
and
some
nutty
flavor
overall
a
nice
and
drinkable
holiday
ale
the
mouth
has
decent
heft
but
may
be
on
the
thin
side
for
a
winter
warmer
this
is
a
nice
changeup
and
is
a
good
introductioncrossover
beer
not
outstanding
but
as
i
drank
i
began
to
taste
the
complexity
of
this
beer
decided
to
open
this
one
while
watching
my
bears
try
not
to
fail
against
the
sad
bills
in
toronto
fingers
are
crossed
both
for
the
game
and
for
the
beer
it
pours
the
beer
that
is
a
cloudy
siennaamber
topped
by
some
shortlived
ecru
foam
which
finds
apex
at
at
best
estimate
a
halffinger
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
brown
sugar
light
maple
syrup
and
a
good
helping
of
nutmeg
it
doesnt
quite
mix
together
very
well
and
just
sits
there
hoping
that
some
strils
come
by
looking
for
a
good
time
the
taste
follows
the
same
spicy
path
but
adds
some
light
tinges
of
orange
and
grapefruit
the
latter
even
lighter
than
the
former
graham
crackers
and
straight
butter
no
margarine
here
son
the
body
is
a
sorta
heftyfeeling
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
grainy
feel
overall
i
think
sp
tried
a
bit
too
hard
to
make
a
spiced
ale
as
the
components
dont
really
mesh
all
that
well
together
its
still
not
that
bad
but
not
necessarily
something
i
would
go
for
very
often
in
the
future
very
well
balanced
and
pretty
damn
drinkable
yet
big
enough
to
be
thrown
at
just
about
any
holiday
dinner
with
each
sip
and
as
it
gets
closer
to
cellar
temperature
it
grows
on
us
a
sure
pick
here
for
your
winter
seasonal
needs
all
in
all
aging
helped
this
beer
along
on
its
way
and
seems
to
have
matured
well
more
hops
would
carry
it
past
the
taste
of
a
doublebock
into
the
holiday
necessities
overall
id
say
its
flavor
and
warming
effect
makes
it
perfect
on
a
cold
night
every
once
in
a
while
md
thin
and
watery
with
a
syrup
like
finish
moderate
carbonation
supports
any
body
this
beer
may
have
light
in
body
and
crisp
in
finish
but
little
flavor
drinkability
a
rather
odd
concotion
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
though
it
is
interesting
enough
to
contemplate
for
a
while
d
this
is
a
nice
winter
ale
from
a
brewer
that
i
usually
dont
hold
in
high
esteem
nutty
and
bready
this
is
a
nice
winter
brew
that
doesnt
do
the
whole
played
out
fruitcake
and
spice
thing
drinkable
on
a
feasttype
evening
but
a
bit
much
for
a
normal
session
good
stuff
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
a
little
on
the
rich
side
interesting
although
a
bit
too
peculiar
and
rich
for
my
tastes
would
probably
go
quite
well
with
sauerkrat
sauerbraten
and
smoked
fish
immediately
felt
warmer
after
this
beer
the
beer
has
to
be
at
least
a
6
coming
in
from
a
blizzard
this
beer
made
me
feel
great
about
the
price
i
paid
for
it
poured
a
semi
dark
orangecopper
color
with
a
1
finger
head
that
dissipated
relatively
quickly
but
retained
somewhat
through
out
the
entire
drink
smelled
especially
caramellike
taste
is
of
some
tasty
malt
notes
and
caramel
with
some
bananaapple
fruitiness
i
am
also
detecting
as
well
mouthfeel
is
alright
it
could
be
emboldened
a
bit
by
adding
a
bit
more
malt
to
the
beer
the
drinkability
is
terrific
the
taste
is
semisweet
and
can
be
savored
while
it
finishes
pretty
dry
and
refreshing
further
warming
probably
will
ensue
d
this
was
a
surprising
good
winter
warmer
it
really
brought
some
great
flavors
a
bit
of
a
let
down
on
the
flavor
malty
bread
undetermined
spices
more
like
a
standard
amber
than
anything
seasonal
good
drinker
with
a
soft
body
sessionable
but
for
the
slightly
high
abv
over
6
at
this
abv
wish
they
put
more
flavor
into
it
rather
decent
brew
my
favorite
from
point
d
a
touch
too
sweet
but
balanced
somewhat
well
its
heading
in
the
right
direction
not
a
holiday
beer
ill
be
back
for
seconds
on
though
but
worth
the
try
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
but
thick
foamed
tan
head
some
sticking
smells
of
chocolate
malt
gingerbread
oranges
caramel
candy
a
cherry
sweetness
and
a
machine
like
funk
quality
light
and
alive
with
carbonation
very
drinkable
although
a
bit
more
sweet
than
i
would
prefer
especially
if
drinking
more
than
one
it
fits
with
the
season
nicely
st
benedicts
winter
ale
is
a
damn
nice
winter
throwback
for
only
7
99
a
6er
beef
up
that
body
a
little
more
and
now
were
talking
it
pours
a
rich
malty
deep
darkish
red
color
but
the
head
fast
disappears
and
the
taste
is
just
soso
average
a
bit
light
on
the
abv
for
the
style
lots
of
maltiness
with
definite
hints
of
chocolate
nothing
to
really
linger
on
the
tongue
and
a
bit
bland
tasting
probably
not
too
bad
as
these
beers
go
but
definitely
not
head
of
the
class
not
that
familiar
with
the
beers
from
this
brewery
but
not
a
bad
effort
at
all
point
represents
one
of
those
breweries
that
i
like
at
times
otherwise
not
their
price
point
is
fantastic
which
does
keep
me
coming
back
as
a
winter
warmer
6
pack
i
could
easily
turn
to
this
beer
pours
a
dark
crimson
color
with
2
inches
of
offwhite
head
that
had
excellant
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
an
exciting
and
complex
aroma
a
lot
of
spices
such
as
cloves
nutmegand
hints
of
dark
fruit
like
figs
and
dates
but
there
is
something
in
the
background
that
lowers
the
score
a
little
it
is
almost
like
an
ashtray
aroma
odd
the
flavor
is
not
as
exciting
plenty
of
spice
up
front
with
the
fruity
flavors
in
the
finish
again
there
is
something
in
the
background
definately
some
ash
seems
out
of
place
in
this
beer
i
would
of
liked
a
little
more
body
in
this
beer
but
otherwise
good
a
surprising
and
good
effort
from
stevens
point
drinkability
quite
a
pleasant
brew
this
one
adequately
exemplifies
its
style
and
would
be
great
to
drink
on
a
cold
holiday
night
while
its
not
the
best
beer
out
there
its
still
pretty
damn
good
not
bad
but
not
great
drinkability
soso
its
not
a
44person
water
skiing
pyramid
but
when
considering
the
rest
of
points
offerings
its
not
half
bad
light
fruits
in
the
flavor
green
grapes
and
pears
decent
amount
of
grassy
hop
flavor
and
has
a
mineraly
british
feel
to
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bad
stale
malt
taste
that
perhaps
could
be
attributed
to
some
oxidation
not
overly
impressed
but
one
of
the
better
point
beers
i
have
tried
from
a
bottle
poured
a
dark
amber
with
low
meandering
carbonation
its
got
a
solid
winter
spiciness
scent
to
itsome
spicy
malt
for
sure
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
blends
well
with
the
malt
used
here
the
body
however
seems
slightly
lower
than
id
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
overall
though
an
enjoyable
little
brew
d
a
decent
winter
brew
but
not
a
stand
out
im
wondering
now
if
i
can
get
some
use
out
of
the
remaining
four
bottles
by
using
them
for
cooking
overall
not
bad
not
the
best
but
still
more
then
decent
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
this
one
any
day
pours
dark
amber
with
a
thick
slightly
bubbly
tan
head
that
tops
off
just
above
the
pint
glass
retention
is
excellent
falling
into
a
thin
covering
over
the
brew
and
leaving
a
small
coat
of
lacing
behind
smell
is
fairly
bold
with
caramel
malts
fruits
yeast
and
hops
tastes
of
spice
and
sweet
malts
with
some
earthiness
and
hop
bitterness
completing
everything
very
well
a
very
tasty
medium
bodied
winter
warmer
that
seeems
to
be
somewhat
underrated
if
you
love
belgian
dark
ales
then
this
is
your
beer
not
my
style
sorry
taste
more
banana
and
clove
in
the
taste
something
about
it
seems
off
perhaps
the
cloves
have
too
big
of
a
presence
i
can
taste
some
other
spice
in
the
aftertaste
but
i
dont
know
what
it
is
pours
a
clear
amber
color
only
a
14
inch
head
with
poor
lacing
and
poor
retention
smells
mainly
of
spices
along
with
a
strong
hops
presence
fits
the
style
had
a
smooth
and
crisp
mouth
feel
there
was
a
high
carbonation
level
tasted
strongly
of
spices
coriander
roasted
malts
and
a
slight
hop
background
overall
a
good
combination
of
flavors
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
average
when
the
over
sweetness
and
funny
feeling
finish
develops
on
my
tongue
after
i
finish
the
drink
or
sip
this
beer
lacks
focus
it
is
malty
and
rich
like
a
nice
bock
but
it
also
has
spicey
characteristics
orange
corriander
all
spice
does
its
alc
amount
really
make
it
a
winter
warmer
it
is
better
when
its
warmer
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
drink
it
where
i
work
and
its
on
tap
dgood
drinkability
it
seems
perhaps
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
for
a
beer
in
the
realm
of
winter
warmers
regardless
this
is
a
smooth
drink
appropriate
for
a
cool
evening
after
work
perhpas
while
studying
comic
books
that
aside
it
isnt
bad
i
could
drink
this
again
it
might
actually
be
a
very
interesting
cooking
beer
im
a
bigger
fan
of
points
beers
than
mostif
they
cost
two
bucks
more
per
sixer
id
bet
theyd
be
a
lot
more
respected
even
so
theres
no
mistaking
this
beer
for
anything
other
than
a
completely
unexceptional
warmer
if
you
have
access
to
sam
adams
or
goose
islands
winter
ales
theres
really
no
reason
to
buy
this
drinkability
decent
beer
for
a
cold
winters
night
from
a
nice
small
town
brewery
that
makes
decent
beer
nothing
to
knock
ones
socks
off
though
on
the
plus
side
its
very
tasty
and
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
it
nothing
wrong
with
that
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
quite
not
good
i
had
no
problem
finishing
this
it
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
active
carbonation
a
little
thin
for
the
style
i
believe
light
bodied
fair
carbonation
this
doesnt
interest
me
much
cant
say
ill
ever
drink
anymore
of
these
its
not
bad
per
say
but
there
are
much
better
options
available
in
this
style
like
all
points
it
is
a
touch
watery
could
be
a
lot
more
chewy
especially
for
the
style
overall
it
is
pretty
mellow
for
the
style
but
the
lack
of
any
overpowering
spices
or
sweetness
makes
it
very
drinkable
pours
a
clear
deep
crimson
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
only
spotty
lacing
in
the
glassware
the
nose
is
a
surprise
this
beer
is
considered
i
surmise
to
be
a
winter
warmer
but
it
smells
more
like
a
fruity
belgianstyle
dubbel
caramel
dark
fruits
raisins
and
fig
the
dominant
note
being
an
estery
yeast
aroma
however
slight
spicy
notes
are
detectable
as
well
though
i
suspect
no
spices
were
added
although
the
packaging
doesnt
indicate
the
palate
is
dry
and
fruity
with
a
distinct
bitterness
that
occasionally
borders
on
tart
this
character
is
more
like
overlyroasted
or
scorched
malt
than
something
fanciful
like
a
wild
or
lactic
yeast
strain
incredibly
estery
this
beer
is
more
like
a
dubbel
light
the
body
and
mouth
feel
is
just
too
light
to
support
the
flavors
this
beer
is
trying
to
achieve
ample
carbonations
leaves
the
beer
all
the
more
dry
in
the
finish
but
does
little
to
compensate
for
the
thin
watery
body
the
label
doesnt
tell
me
the
abv
of
this
beer
but
id
suspect
it
to
be
on
the
very
low
end
for
a
winter
warmer
maybe
6
or
thereabouts
this
is
an
okay
beer
for
the
season
but
not
something
to
flip
over
this
beer
strikes
me
as
one
that
could
be
quite
pleasant
if
it
were
improved
in
a
couple
of
vital
aspects
particularly
the
thin
body
and
slightly
acrid
offflavor
having
said
that
though
this
isnt
bad
and
not
a
drain
pour
beer
by
any
means
i
give
it
kudos
for
effort
with
a
little
work
st
benedicts
winter
ale
has
a
chance
to
be
steven
points
finest
beer
hells
bells
given
what
else
they
produce
it
might
be
already
with
a
little
bulking
up
this
could
a
contender
i
wonder
if
what
i
am
drinking
is
what
was
intended
there
is
the
outline
of
a
decent
beer
here
but
there
also
seems
to
be
some
problems
though
not
exactly
what
i
expected
and
lacking
the
flavor
that
i
expected
for
this
type
of
ale
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
drinkable
seasonal
beverage
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
crimson
with
no
lasting
head
no
lacing
meh
the
aroma
has
some
caramel
dark
fruits
like
cherry
cranberry
perhaps
some
spicing
pretty
ok
the
taste
is
decent
again
some
caramel
and
sweetly
malts
cranberry
is
there
again
dry
herbal
hops
a
bit
tart
and
honestly
kind
of
tastes
like
a
dubbel
dont
like
that
tart
part
but
otherwise
its
decent
the
mouth
is
medium
ok
carbonation
didnt
start
out
well
but
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
in
all
its
rather
stock
this
beer
is
available
at
the
8th
street
grill
in
downtown
minneapolis
they
are
trying
to
be
a
beer
destination
with
over
30
beers
on
tap
but
thats
a
topic
for
another
review
although
this
site
lists
this
as
a
winter
warmer
the
bar
lists
it
as
a
belgian
dubbel
although
this
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
than
a
winter
warmer
its
claim
to
either
style
is
weakjust
like
the
beer
served
on
tap
this
pours
a
pleasing
clear
amber
color
there
is
no
smell
to
speak
of
the
taste
has
slight
fruity
overtones
with
apple
and
pear
predominating
but
it
tastes
as
if
it
was
watered
down
this
is
the
classic
macro
attempt
at
a
craft
brew
style
dont
make
the
taste
too
strong
so
as
not
to
offend
the
point
lager
crowd
well
im
not
buying
itliterally
the
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
the
drinkability
is
poor
whatever
style
this
is
supposed
to
be
it
just
doesnt
get
it
done
drinkability
not
my
favorite
holidaywinter
beer
would
not
consider
this
for
a
session
beer
purchased
as
part
of

at
local

never
been
a
big
fan
of
the

of

i
must
admit
i
am
prone
to
liking
point
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
the
stevens
point
brewery
has
again
reaffirmed
another
reason
why
i
love
this
wonderful
small
city
good
people
overall
this
was
definitely
much
better
than
i
expected
and
its
become
my
favorite
seasonal
beer
extremely
drinkable
with
a
much
more
subtle
flavor
than
most
overspiced
winter
beers
definitely
try
it
at
least
once
if
its
available
in
your
area
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
winter
ale
vanilla
is
the
dominant
flavor
and
it
could
not
be
smoother
drinking
grab
it
if
you
see
it
its
very
hard
to
get
your
hands

aroma
of

what
is

for
and

initial

favorites

really

the
taste
vanilla
dark

sweetness
from
the

and
a
dry
slightly
spicy
finish
from
the
hops
and
cinnamon
this
beer
is
all
about
balance
flavor
mouthfeel
aroma
they
are
all
perfectly
balanced
making
this
an
excellent
winter
warmer
i
thought
this
beer
was
amazing
its
not
really
heavy
more
of
a
medium
ale
the
flavors
that
really
stuck
out
to
me
were
vanilla
and
hazelnut
the
vanilla
isnt
too
overbearing
as
some
can
be
the
hazelnut
evens
it
out
to
make
a
sweet
nonbitter
excellent
winter
ale
wish
they
had
it
all
year
this
is
a
rather
good
winter
warmer
that
with
a
bit
more
malt
could
be
great

cold

winter
ale
is
a
really
good
seasonal
i
dont
get
why
it
is
in
such
demand

sell
out
in
one

i
am

winter
spices
especially
nutmeg

with

this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
worth
driving
all
over
town
trying
to
find
one
bottle
all
most
places
would
sell
me
plenty
of
other
seasonals
that
are
just
as
good
o
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
more
so
than
i
thought
i
would
ill
probably
add
this
to
my

sigh
o
apparently
this
beer
falls
in
the
used
to
be
so
much
better
class
of
seasonal
releases
but
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
kind
of
on
the
light
side
for
a
winter
warmer
in
regards
to
both
abv
and
malt
content
but
i
cant
mention
enough
how
the
hops
really
make
all
the
spices
sing
together
in
a
unique
harmony
a
must
try
if
you
have
the
chance
so
glad
i
was
able
to
six
months
after
it
was
released
cold
mountain
is
a
handsome
beer
every
aspect
is
a
hit
in
my
book
and
spiced
beer
isnt
usually
my
thing
in
this
case
its
done
with
a
deft
hand
and
great
knowledge
smells
delicious
tastes
immeasurably
complex
well
rounded
and
comforting
tastes
like
a
fruit
cake
thats
actually
good
like
how
you
think
a
fruitcake
would
taste
if
youve
never
had
one
and
were
told
its
ingredients
delicious
thanks
wil
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
rubytinted
caramel
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
surface
coating
of
foam
aromas
of
roasted
nut
sweetness
plum
dates
raisins
berries
toffee
and
caramel
in
the
backbone
and
a
subtle
cinnamon
spicing
smells
are
rich
but
light
enough
to
refrain
from
overpowering
flavors
are
roasted
and
rich
forward
with
a
tart
and
tangy
berry
and
nut
sweetness
blending
on
the
palate
with
some
woody
and
subtle
bitter
highlights
the
body
is
robust
but
light
with
a
transition
into
a
crisp
clean
finish
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
although
some
fruity
notes
do
linger
through
easy
drinker
and
full
of
flavor
o
great
winter
warmer
this
one
has
gotten
a
lot
of
attention
especially
around
the
holidays
i
have
tried
it
for
several
years
and
i
do
feel
that
it
has
lost
something
this
year
2013
it
has
a
nice
dark
color
the
smell
is
very
festive
for
which
it
represents
it
has
an
almost
egg
nogg
smell
and
to
a
certain
degree
taste
as
well
i
like
eggnogg
and
i
like
beer
and
i
do
believe
that
this
one
balances
that
pretty
well
most
holidaywinter
beers
have
too
much
of
one
spice
or
another
but
this
one
balances
it
pretty
well
but
this
year
did
fall
a
little
flat
to
me
i
enjoyed
it
its
a
great
beer
and
much
better
than
most
but
there
was
a
bit
less
of
the
things
i
used
to
like
about
it
and
more
of
the
just
average
ale
taste
coming
through
i
like
a
good
ale
and
this
would
be
a
good
one
by
itself
but
for
a
quarter
of
the
price
overall
i
will
continue
to
have
a
pour
of
this
around
the
holidays
when
i
run
across
it
one
thing
i
would
like
to
try
is
it
on
draft
but
that
is
nearly
impossible
to
do
it
goes
extremely
quickly
and
you
have
to
be
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
i
am
like
dr
john
unfortunately
aside
from
the
malt
fruitiness
metallic
character
and
slightly
overly
bitter
finish
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
like
the
subtlety
of
spicing
good
malt
character
though
it
may
benefit
from
even
more
o
easy
to
drink
with
hints
of
interesting
spices
that
are
very
complimentary
to
the
ale
sweet
flavors
but
not
too
sweet
to
drink
by
the
gallon
id
highly
recommend
this
well
balanced
beer
great
combination
of
raspberry
cranberry
and
vanilla
it
has
a
slight
taste
of
cinnamon
and
hops
smooth
creamy
taste
without
an
after
taste
it
has
a
good
spicy
smell
which
is
pleasant
i
like
cold
mountain
as
a
good
winter
ale
highland
has
done
a
good
job
with
this
one
o
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again
for
13
for
the
liter
size
i
just
wasnt
that
impressed
with
this
one
if
it
was
offered
in
the
10
size
pack
format
it
would
be
a
decent
winter
warmer
i
do
like
that
it
isnt
super
spiced
and
also
doesnt
have
the
medicinal
flavors
that
some
of
this
style
have
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
took
it
to
xmas
dinner
to
share
with
family
but
drank
95
of
it
myself
i
loved
the
uncommon
flavor
combination
of
the
berries
vanilla
caramel
and
cinnamon
nicely
balanced
as
well
overall
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
to
me
is
not
very
exciting
i
do
like
how
the
beer
isnt
overly
sweet
like
a
lot
of
winter
warmers
can
be
have
also
had
in
a
growler
but
was
a
very
subpar
draft
would
not
recommend
on
draft
bottled
1213
pours

of
spice
and
chocolate
light
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
smooth
but
not
slick
or
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
not
a
strong
flavored
ale
it
has
more
of
a
subdued
profile
rather
than
a
flavor
bomb
light
spice
cinnamoncardamom
over
a
light
sweetness
pleasant
and
not
overpowering
crisp
finish
that
leaves
a
slight
bitter
and
spice
aftertaste
that
is
also
tart
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
in
a
dark
pub
or
at
home
with
a
book
in
front
of
the
fireplace
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day

o
the
fact
that
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
its
style
class
in
the
winter
warmer
category
doesnt
surprise
me
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
translucent
red
with
high
visible
carbonation
and
a
small
off
white
head
smells
of
dark
roast
grain
dominated
by
caramel
tastes
of
slight
chocolate
and
coffee
but
with
a
little
hop
bite
nice
grain
balance
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
an
above
average
beer
o
most
winter
warmers
seem
to
taste
the
same
for
the
most
part
but
this
one
sets
itself
apart
from
all
of
the
other
typical
flavors
of
the
style
the
flavors
are
more
complex
and
are
reminiscent
of
the
season
id
gladly
purchase
this
again
and
again
medium
bodied
wih
a
dry
medicinal
flavor
along
with
a
heavy
vanilla
and
spice
presence
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
sweet
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
notes
of
hazelnut
toffee
raspberry
cherry
juice
and
lots
of
vanilla
floralpotpourri
like
with
zesty
cinnamon
and
clove
spiciness
really
weird
combination
of
flavors
not
bad
but
a
few
ounces
was
more
than
enough
for
me
o
most
winter
warmers
are
overspiced
and
generally
taste
the
same
this
one
though
its
a
nice
changeup
from
the
normal
and
something
thats
done
very
well
well
done
highland
o
this
is
a
terrific
winter
warmer
it
has
a
rich
and
hearty
malt
profile
with
just
the
right
amount
of
seasonal
spices
mixed
in
in
addition
it
is
insanely
drinkable
i
finished
the
bomber
before
i
knew
it
even
better
its
only
5
8
abv
who
ever
heard
of
a
sessionable
winter
warmer
i
personally
love
the
idea
awesome
beer
from
highland
mouthfeel
is
great
in
addition
to
all
of
the
great
very
well
blended
flavors
the
beer
is
the
heavier
end
of
light
bodied
with
a
great
carbonation
level
great
sweetness
with
some
natural
bitterness
at
the
end
but
still
clean
its
complex
but
soft
and
overall
really
well
balanced
great
drink
ability
its
easily
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
had
all
year
and
i
could
drink
it
all
winter
but
this
brew
could
go
deeper
into
the
spring
if
it
wanted
to
as
well
as
start
in
the
fall
nice
job
highland
totally
digging
this
beer
but
im
not
surprised
thanks
paschal
for
the
awesome
hookup
o
very
different
than
most
winter
ales
or
winter
warmers
sweet
spices
and
not
much
alcohol
relatively
speaking
make
it
really
stand
out
would
pair
nicely
with
some
pumpkin
or
pecan
pie
next
year
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
everything
is
a
bit
too
subtle
plus
i
shouldnt
be
getting
alcohol
in
a
5
8
beer
o
not
generally
a
style
i
go
after
but
this
was
a
very
well
made
beer
i
noticed
it
has
hazelnut
raspberry
and
cranberry
extracts
as
well
as
cinnamon
and
vanilla
listed
on
the
ingredient
list
its
a
bit
hard
to
discern
each
ingredient
but
they
do
work
together
to
produce
a
nice
taste
of
winter
o
this
beer
is
quite
unusual
for
the
style
and
has
an
interesting
mix
of
fruity
flavors
and
spices
i
liked
how
the
dynamics
of
the
beer
changed
as
it
warmed
up
which
make
for
it
being
an
interesting
winter
warmer
to
sip
body
is
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
tan
creamy
head
the
head
recedes
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
and
leaves
only
a
little
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
dominated
by
hints
of
cinnamon
and
vanilla
with
a
light
fruit
scent
spice
leads
the
way
on
the
tongue
also
i
thought
the
fruit
would
of
been
apples
but
the
label
says
raspberries
and
cranberries
i
can
kind
of
pick
up
on
the
tartness
of
the
cranberries
but
the
raspberries
are
lost
under
the
dominating
presence
of
cinnamon
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
thin
for
a
winter
warmer
carbonation
is
nice
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
i
dont
usually
like
winter
warmers
but
this
one
is
very
drinkable
i
wish
the
raspberrries
played
a
bigger
role
in
the
beer
and
the
vanilla
would
be
better
in
a
leading
role
instead
of
the
cinnamon
none
the
less
it
is
still
worth
drinking
but
with
the
thin
body
and
fairly
low
abv
i
dont
know
how
warm
it
will
keep
you
this
winter
for
me
the
major
smell
and
taste
was
vanilla
i
tasted
a
little
cinnamon
but
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
chocolate
or
roasted
flavors
others
mentioned
it
was
what
i
would
call
a
good
light
roasted
flavored
beer
i
generally
prefer
stouts
porters
and
quads
this
was
a
nice
light
alternative
that
was
very
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
awesome
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
m
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
strange
beer
its
heavy
in
terms
of
sweetness
but
the
excellentcarbonated
body
is
light
the
flavor
says
sip
me
but
the
mouthfeel
says
gulp
me
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
cinnamon
and
butter
and
vanilla
bomb
a
great
and
very
different
winter
seasonal
and
a
perfect
beer
for
limited
release
delicious
and
seasonappropriate
and
sweet
and
spicy
enough
that
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
regularly
o
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
winter
warmer
id
try
to
get
this
one
that
being
said
like
gl
xmas
ale
i
dont
think
this
beer
justifies
the
hype
it
has
around
here
9
months
later
sept
2013
a
bottle
kept
in
a
cooler
is
every
bit
as
tasty
o
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
but
after

12
pints
i
was
ready
to
move
on
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
could
almost
think
it
had
been
barrel
aged
nice
combination
of
the
spices
cocoa
and
vanilla
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
i
had
no
problem
putting
down
a
couple
of
glasses
very
nice
of
a
fairly
cold
november
evening
but
would
have
been
improved
by
sitting
in
front
of
the
fireplace
o
this
is
an
exceptional
winter
beer
and
i
am
surprised
how
much
i
like
it
it
is
fairly
lightweight
all
things
considered
but
it
is
just
the
perfect
taste
really
enjoy
it
and
intend
to
drink
many
more
this
season
overall
this
is
an
old
favorite
among
north
carolinians
and
honestly
shouldnt
get
such
high
marks
nowadays
its
still
good
just
not
amazing
o
this
beer
tasted
nothing
like
i
expected
i
expected
the
typical
nutmeg
clove
cinnamon
etc
it
is
loaded
with
intense
chocolate
and
caramel
im
surprised
how
flavorful
this
beer
is
considering
its
a
winter
warmer
and
this
is
june
i
would
drink
the
shit
out
of
this
each
winter
if
i
were
in
the
distribution
area
the
beer
pours
a
clear
rusty
amber
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
a
tremendous
caramel
and
a
slight
woodiness
maple
the
taste
is
just
as
sweet
with
almost
no
spice
and
almost
no
carbonation
after
sitting
a
few
minutes
there
is
almost
no
alcohol
present
either
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
to
have
mid
summer
but
its
not
too
bad
this
one
is
far
better
if
allowed
to
warm
o
an
enjoyable
winter
warmer
on
a
cold
rainy
day
o
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
winter
warmer
i
tend
to
like
beers
in
this
style
to
have
a
little
more
body
but
this
is
a
great
beer
nonetheless
light
caramel
flavors
and
none
too
rich
im
glad
that
this
isnt
just
another
winter
warmer
with
ginger
and
cinnamon
i
like
the
fruitiness
here
but
i
find
the
medicinal
off
notes
in
the
finish
a
little
unpleasant
i
probably
wouldnt
have
this
again
but
i
do
like
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
one
was
anticipating
more
with
this
one
with
all
the
hype
all
in
all
a
solid
brew
good
quality
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
deep
red
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
laces
very
well
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
solid
amount
of
vanilla
sweet
malts
and
holiday
spices
the
taste
is
absolutely
delicious
with
a
large
amount
of
hazelnutcream
soda
flavor
on
the
tongue
that
i
really
didnt
expect
among
the
sweet
malts
vanilla
and
spices
that
i
did
expect
its
perfectly
balanced
with
the
spices
coming
in
a
bit
stronger
on
the
finish
to
stop
the
overall
impression
from
being
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
with
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
fantastic
winter
warmer
im
glad
i
know
a
store
that
still
has
some
of
these
left
because
im
going
back
for
more
o
this
was
a
nice
surprise
i
wasnt
sure
how
this
one
was
going
to
hold
up
but
id
have
another
from
the
basement
the
cream
soda
aspect
was
a
nice
touch
great
caramel
and
vanilla
flavors
o
nothing
overly
exciting
to
report
about
this
beer
drinkable
but
not
really
my
cupotea
overall
impression
fantastic
not
as
strong
as
most
winter
warmers
but
all
of
the
attributes
of
this
one
made
up
for
it
if
given
two
words
to
describe
this
one
it
would
be
creamy
caramel
get
your
hands
on
this
one
o
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
great
complex
flavors
and
tastes
easy
to
drink
winner
single
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
clear
amber
body
aroma
is
mild
mostly
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
burnt
toast
flavor
is
a
little
syrup
like
molasses
on
a
spicy
caaramel
malt
background
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
almost
had
a
cough
syrup
like
note
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
wanting
to
find
a
great
english
winter
warmer
but
for
me
this
style
is
a
little
to
sweet
to
seek
out
perhaps
with
dessert
this
would
be
great
but
as
a
cold
weather
sipper
id
look
for
another
style
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
american
version
most
others
are
more
bitter
this
one
i
would
buy
multiple
times
well
worth
it
146th
o
a
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
unique
with
its
heavy
cream
soda
character
so
delicious
this
is
almost
a
great
beer
i
love
the
vanilla
aspect
and
it
smells
sublime
but
there
are
just
a
few
minor
things
preventing
this
from
being
what
it
could
still
pretty
enjoyable
i
will
say
that
this
year
has
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
profile
than
i
remember
in
the
previous
years
not
a
terrible
thing
but
i
definitely
do
think
i
prefer
last
years
vintage
o
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
highly
drinkable
and
its
a
must
to
split
with
friends
do
yourself
a
favor
and
seek
it
out
buy
this
beer
you
will
not
be
disappointed
d
drinkable
to
a
point
moderate
alcohol
doesnt
wallop
you
like
some
of
the
910ers
one
of
these
with
or
post
meal
would
hit
the
spot
if
you
dont
mind
some
sweetness
in
your
beer
and
can
tolerate
the
slight
dr
pepper
vibe
i
would
recommend
it
cold
mountain
was
quite
a
revelation
a
great
way
to
start
an
evening
of
beers
with
friends
tonight
a
distinct
winter
warmer
be
prepared
for
a
different
enjoyable
take
on
this
style
very
delicious
o
i
just
cant
help
but
think
cocoa
pebbles
i
liked
cocoa
pebbles
as
a
kid
though
so
it
takes
me
back
a
bit
im
definitely
a
fan
just
because
ive
never
experienced
this
flavor
in
a
beer
before
its
interesting
and
new
to
me
o
the
vanilla
and
spices
really
save
this
one
from
mediocrity
but
it
could
use
more
body
id
probably
have
this
one
again
if
it
was
offered
in
tx
o
a
decent
beer
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
cream
soda
i
enjoy
it
fairly
well
but
its
not
terribly
complex
and
the
watery
body
is
a
bit
offputting
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
while
i
do
feel
it
could
use
a
little
more
alcohol
to
add
warmth
the
body
does
not
suffer
due
to
it
only
being
5
8
i
will
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
again
o
overall
kind
of
wee
heavy
like
but
the
feel
is
much
thinner
the
buiscut
malt
leaves
a
powdery
feeling
while
all
the
spices
tingle
the
tongue
well
put
together
and
worth
the
search
o
d
its
a
bit
dry
for
my
liking
and
has
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
in
the
nose
but
its
pretty
good
pours
a
pretty
reddish
orange
a
touch
of
white
head
a
very
nice
colour
smells
sweet
sweet
sweet
cinnamon
as
well
on
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
tastes
very
busy
vanilla
cinnamon
some
light
nuttiness
lots
going
on
in
this
beer
its
really
quite
tasty
thick
boozy
mouthfeel
overall
pretty
tasty
a
light
carbonation
goes
a
long
way
with
this
brew
it
really
lets
the
sweet
malt
flavors
shine
and
doesnt
distract
with
too
much
bite
a
smooth
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
delicious
and
fun
to
drink
even
in
the
middle
of
summer
like
im
doing
a
great
brew
and
worth
discovering
for
yourself
this
beer
won
at
our
blind
tasting
party
as
the
beer
of
the
night
great
mild
malty
beer
with
hints
of
earthy
hops
the
smell
is
of
light
chocolate
toasted
malts
and
hints
of
roasted
qualities
faint
whispers
of
vanilla
and
subtle
notes
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
toasted
malts
mild
earthy
tones
vanilla
chocolate
and
spices
great
subtly
complex
and
very
drinkable
awesome
beer

d
not
awful
or
really
offensive
in
any
way
although
the
syrupy
addition
is
a
bit
cloying
its
just
too
thin
and
spiceless
for
a
winter
warmer
im
not
exactly
sure
where
the
a
positive
buzz
is
coming
from
with
this
brew
thanks
for
a
beer
ive
never
had
jon
i
do
always
appreciate
the
chance
to
try
em
d
a
nice
winter
warmer
taste
was
a
little
lacking
but
still
enjoyable
would
have
again
i
am
usually
a
little
weary
of
winter
warmers
but
this
one
hits
the
spot
even
on
this
cold
night
in
feb
all
in
all
i
cant
say
im
completely
impressed
by
this
one
i
love
a
good
vanilla
and
spice
winter
brew
but
this
one
may
have
just
missed
the
mark
a
tad
not
my
favorite
offering
from
highland
but
i
could
see
warming
up
to
another
glass
if
i
was
in
the
right
mood
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
next
year
a
drinkable
brew
but
not
what
i
consider
a
winter
warmer
thanks
to
jackthebear
for
the
chance
to
try
this
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
an
amber
brown
with
little
head
and
little
lacing
smell
nothing
much
here
some
applejuice
flavors
taste
this
one
is
very
unique
not
like
any
winter
warmer
i
have
ever
had
i
get
some
butter
flavors
with
something
reminiscent
of
a
fig
or
date
flavor
with
some
apple
and
spices
on
the
end
this
is
extremely
drinkable
yet
i
have
no
idea
what
the
abv
is
it
isnt
on
the
bottle
the
alcohol
seems
to
be
well
hidden
regardless
i
could
easily
mistake
this
for
a
session
beer
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
it
is
something
i
could
really
pound
pours
a
nice
caramel
color
with
a
really
light
head
doesnt
really
stick
around
too
long
and
only
leaves
a
spot
or
two
of
lacing
the
nose
is
loaded
with
vanilla
though
it
smells
somewhat
like
extract
theres
also
a
bit
of
caramel
and
malty
sweetness
the
taste
is
more
vanilla
plus
some
caramel
not
much
else
though
its
fairly
nice
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
finishes
quite
dry
not
terribly
complex
and
not
all
the
winter
warmery
but
pretty
good
d
a
nice
winter
warmer
taste
was
a
little
lacking
but
still
enjoyable
would
have
again
beer
is
sweet
and
undercarbonated
on
the
palate
huhzubendah
said
in
his
review
that
it
tasted
like
cream
soda
and
it
totally
does
the
vanilla
wins
on
all
front
here
it
opens
with
some
sugary
sweetness
that
is
accented
by
the
vanilla
on
the
late
front
and
midpalate
there
is
no
real
bitterness
to
this
beer
just
vanilla
it
probably
sounds
like
im
putting
it
down
and
im
not
i
really
am
not
it
does
what
it
does
well
beer
as
cream
soda
i
like
that
d
a
fun
and
interesting
brew
but
not
something
of
which
i
would
want
too
much
traders
note
many
thanks
to
supertrader
crellmoset
for
this
fine
elixir
thanks
to
bucketboy
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
pours
a
translucent
amber
with
a
quarter
inch
loose
offwhite
head
that
quickly
disperses
into
a
thin
band
around
the
shoulders
some
strands
of
lacing
appear
during
the
tasting
but
exhibit
poor
retention
nose
is
somewhat
muted
light
to
medium
malt
with
a
suggestion
of
spice
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
addition
of
some
carameltoffee
notes
the
spice
seems
to
be
be
nutmeg
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
lively
carbonation
which
contributes
to
a
semidry
finish
all
and
all
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
not
at
all
cloying
with
enough
flavor
to
make
this
quite
quaffable
d
i
wish
it
would
either
have
bolder
flavors
and
become
a
sipper
or
have
a
thinner
body
and
become
quaffable
the
thick
body
and
weaker
flavors
combination
is
odd
note
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
bottle
tap
and
cask
im
really
impressed
with
highland
brewing
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
tried
from
them
and
each
has
been
really
good
i
cant
say
that
this
is
necessarily
better
than
their
black
mocha
stout
but
theyre
very
comparable
in
terms
of
quality
i
cant
offer
much
constructive
criticism
here
this
is
good
stuff
that
perhaps
shouldnt
be
tinkered
with
much
maybe
the
look
would
benefit
from
a
nicer
head
yeah
thats
about
it
excellent
stuff
thanks
a
ton
dan
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
light
brown
sugar
vanilla
cinnamon
a
light
but
simple
sweetness
a
blend
of
brown
sugar
and
burnt
sugar
is
present
notes
of
vanilla
and
maple
appear
in
the
midpalate
drying
on
the
finish
with
the
hops
asserting
their
presence
theres
a
blend
of
earthy
leafy
bitterness
and
lingering
vanilla
light
in
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
i
preferred
this
on
tap
where
it
was
a
lot
creamier
but
even
out
of
a
bottle
its
still
the
best
winter
warmer
out
there
oimo
a
subpar
beer
i
cannot
get
past
the
hazelnut
extract
flavor
that
dominates
the
beer
i
do
like
the
fact
that
highland
stepped
outside
the
bound
of
your
traditional
winter
warmer
with
some
tweaking
however
i
think
this
could
be
a
good
beer
needs
more
burn
thanks
to
msnow34
for
trading
with
me
for
this
and
sorry
about
the
delay
with
getting
my
end
of
the
trade
off
to
you
a
decent
yet
different
winter
warmer
glad
i
tried
this
one
very
unique
beer
that
i
would
definitely
try
again
and
would
recommend
fairly
drinkable
decent
enough
for
a
winter
ale
but
a
little
timid
for
what
it
seems
to
want
to
be
great
beer
highly
drinkable
just
for
the
holidays
it
pours
brownamber
wit
a
slightly
reddish
hue
there
is
both
a
nice
head
and
lace
formations
to
this
beer
the
smell
is
almost
that
of
a
bourbon
ale
with
some
spiciness
the
taste
is
definitely
interesting
but
ill
be
honest
about
saying
i
have
mixed
feelings
on
the
taste
it
is
very
sweet
with
tones
of
christmas
cookie
spices
there
are
tones
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
coriander
it
also
seems
like
anise
and
vanilla
are
present
i
think
i
like
it
but
find
it
a
little
overpowering
at
the
same
point
it
has
a
hardy
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
dit
goes
down
easily
too
easily
actually
this
one
is
just
disappointing
the
taste
is
about
average
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
weak
and
it
doesnt
really
warm
you
i
shall
not
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
drinkability
is
ok
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
it
that
the
flavors
dont
gel
the
feel
is
loose
makes
for
a
scattered
sort
of
beer
possibly
a
tad
better
as
it
warms
it
isnt
enough
to
save
this
one
for
me
it
the
taste
were
blended
as
well
as
the
nose
the
feel
were
more
robust
this
would
be
a
winner
for
sure
drinkability
this
growler
did
disappear
quickly
not
sure
of
the
abv
maybe
6
7
not
a
beer
ill
be
hunting
in
the
future
to
be
honest
averys
old
jubilation
much
preferred
but
a
nice
brew
on
a
fairly
cold
ga
winter
night
notes
not
the
biggest
or
boldest
but
perfectly
balanced
and
not
too
spiced
up
pours
a
deep
brown
mahogany
color
with
a
small
tan
head
and
a
really
heavy
amount
of
lacing
smells
yeasty
with
a
little
hint
of
the
malts
coming
through
tastes
of
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
plenty
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
possibly
some
all
spice
a
little
marshmallow
in
the
background
like
sitting
around
a
campfire
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
with
a
little
hiding
carbonation
drinkability
is
really
good
overall
impression
disappointing
offering
from
a
generally
solid
brewery
very
nice
drinkability
not
sure
of
the
abv
but
doesnt
seem
too
high

the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cloves
coriander
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cloves
chocolate
and
caramel
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
one
had
some
pretty
nice
spice
mixtures
going
on
here
it
was
very
well
balanced
upfront
and
then
came
through
with
the
typical
warmer
spices
on
the
tailend
this
one
is
a
must
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
winter
warmers
d
a
great
brew
fantastic
flavor
balance
and
a
moderate
body
for
the
style
i
went
through
the
bomber
quickly
and
will
most
definitely
seek
out
one
of
the
swingtop
bottles
soon
d
i
can
drink
this
beer
day
in
and
day
out
though
it
is
not
one
of
my
prized
beers
for
its
rarity
style
or
just
an
amazing
complex
beer
and
it
seems
to
be
less
spicey
this
year
as
years
past
cold
mountain
is
my
comfort
beer
it
reminds
me
of
past
times
good
friends
and
the
holidays
in
wnc
so
without
and
objective
point
of
view
if
you
see
it
out
pick
it
up
and
give
it
a
try
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
i
have
become
a
big
fan
of
highlands
cold
mountain
and
rush
out
to
purchase
it
with
each
years
release
in
nov
i
must
say
that
this
years
is
the
most
disappointing
of
the
bunch
not
as
spicy
or
complex
as
in
years
past
the
mouthfeel
is
much
lighter
and
the
beer
just
taste
overall
watered
down
im
glad
i
tried
this
ontap
before
buying
the
big
bottle
ill
will
push
this
one
to
the
side
as
cold
mountain
at
least
for
this
year
has
become
a
meer
average
winter
warmer
and
will
look
forward
to
next
years
version
as
fans
of
the
previous
offerings
of
cold
mountain
my
wife
and
i
both
agree
this
was
a
poor
showing
another
bottle
in
the
fridge
we
will
give
it
one
more
chance
but
are
not
as
excited
about
future
showings
as
we
have
been
in
the
past
perhaps
it
will
cellar
and
age
well
and
we
will
buy
another
to
try
again
in
six
months
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
both
average
for
the
style
overall
a
decent
if
not
spectacular
example
of
the
style
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
pretty
interesting
pretty
good
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
1
liter
bottle
and
poured
into
several
goblets
shared
with
a
friend
who
received
it
in
a
trade
amber
as
it
is
poured
and
little
head
yields
minimal
lacing
no
taste
particularly
stands
out
the
predominant
flavor
is
that
of
bitter
nuts
caramel
and
vanilla
more
malty
than
hoppy
would
prefer
a
bit
more
lingering
taste
from
this
beer
but
still
a
good
one
to
spend
an
evening
with
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
for
a
winter
warmer
and
to
be
honest
its
much
better
than
i
expected
easy
drinking
with
some
good
flavor
definitely
better
suited
for
a
cold
winter
night
in
front
of
a
fire
but
its
holding
its
own
on
this
warm
spring
afternoon
whats
nice
about
this
beer
is
that
its
not
just
a
spiced
up
malt
bomb
like
a
lot
of
winter
warmers
theres
so
much
more
going
on
definitely
one
of
the
more
interesting
and
tasty
winter
warmers
i
have
had
in
some
time
d
easily
my
favorite
winter
warmer
i
will
be
looking
for
this
inseason
next
time
around
given
how
much
my
wife
and
i
enjoyed
this
on
an
overwarm
april
day
d
i
finished
the
beer
although
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
try
it
again
based
on
this
sample
what
a
beer
this
was
cold
mountain
winter
ale
is
a
brew
that
would
make
any
nc
native
proud
i
first
had
this
pint
at
the
flying
saucer
in
raleigh
nc
after
three
friends
ordered
the
a
pint
of
this
highland
beer
and
urged
me
to
do
the
same
as
with
any
new
beer
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
and
anxious
however
cold
mountain
came
through
the
appearance
was
a
dark
rosy
color
similar
to
an
amber
ale
the
smell
was
almost
flowery
reminiscent
of
samuel
adams
nobel
pils
i
was
a
bit
worried
when
i
saw
the
beermaid
presenting
me
with
this
pint
it
had
little
to
no
head
i
dont
know
if
that
was
because
of
the
beer
itself
or
if
the
bartender
simply
didnt
know
how
to
pour
a
pint
it
had
a
very
light
mouth
feel
with
almost
no
trace
of
bitterness
very
similar
to
red
oak
but
it
had
more
fruity
hints
to
it
almost
like
a
kind
of
grapey
aftertaste
i
loved
cold
mountain
winter
aile
and
would
highly
recommend
it
impression
i
would
get
this
every
year
but
highland
comes
here
not
bye
done
of
my
most
favorite
spiced
winter
brews
a
near
perfect
combination
of
malt
and
spice
that
makes
this
one
so
easy
to
drink
no
sense
in
decribing
the
color
head
and
lacing
of
this
beer
it
is
prettu
much
the
same
as
everyone
elses
reviews
ynice
malty
smell
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
torn
by
the
taste
on
this
one
i
normally
like
sweet
tasting
drinks
but
this
one
was
almost
too
sweet
almost
like
having
a
dessert
wine
however
perhaps
because
this
was
my
nightcap
i
am
somewhat
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
if
i
knew
before
hand
that
this
was
my
last
beer
of
the
night
i
would
be
happy
to
have
it
but
if
i
had
started
off
the
night
with
this
one
i
would
have
been
disappointed
i
do
not
think
there
is
much
drinkability
here
d
a
sweet
brown
winter
ale
which
has
a
nice
creamy
smoothness
and
yet
moderately
complex
with
both
spice
and
malt
presenting
a
balanced
drinkable
brew
overall
i
am
somewhat
torn
by
this
beer
while
i
did
enjoy
drinking
it
it
didnt
have
much
complexity
it
tasted
just
like
vanilla
coke
which
seemed
both
a
positive
and
a
negative
i
gave
it
a
solid
4
across
the
board
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
but
it
doesnt
come
close
to
anchors
annual
offering
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
a
stingy
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
but
laces
the
sides
quite
nicely
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
spices
i
pick
up
some
cocoa
brown
sugar
molasses
plums
or
prunes
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
theres
a
subtle
spice
in
the
nose
that
is
quite
nondescript
but
really
pleasant
taste
is
sweet
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
up
front
dark
fruits
and
a
tease
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
mid
way
through
mediumdry
sweet
malty
sugary
finish
ample
carbonation
slick
syrupy
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
on
this
cold
snowy
day
i
think
it
all
comes
together
really
well
d
a
nice
complex
and
interesting
flavor
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
d
really
great
beer
and
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
thanks
again
to
scifan
for
the
bottle
dits
not
bad
i
like
the
taste
but
the
body
could
have
been
a
little
fuller
some
presence
of
alcohol
also
take
away
from
a
decent
winter
warmer
d
a
very
good
winter
warmer
extremely
drinkable
could
easily
drink
several
in
a
sitting
highly
recommended
very
solid
winter
warmer
from
highland
a
fair
amount
of
local
hype
on
this
one
and
i
was
not
terribly
impressed
for
my
first
one
coulda
got
an
08
but
i
will
check
it
out
again
next
year
edit
just
noticed
i
rated
the
ontap
version
exactly
the
same
for
the
big
three
of
appearance
taste
and
aroma
nice
faint
sweet
aroma
of
vanilla
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
taste
is
where
this
beer
fails
me
my
sample
had
a
lingering
metallic
aftertaste
that
just
would
not
go
away
last
years
version
was
what
i
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
this
year
highland
missed
the
mark
with
me
a
clear
but
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
fair
offwhite
head
that
settles
quickly
to
a
whispy
ring
with
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
solid
chocolatey
malt
with
herbal
hops
not
huge
but
very
pleasant
with
a
kiss
of
ginger
nutmeg
the
flavor
brings
lots
of
tasty
sweet
vanilla
and
an
herbal
bite
theres
a
nice
toffee
malt
blended
in
for
what
i
find
to
be
a
really
nicely
balanced
brew
its
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
somewhat
viscous
feel
and
a
decent
fizz
to
liven
things
up
this
vanilla
theme
offers
some
spice
notes
that
are
subtle
and
fulfilling
final
touches
on
this
very
enjoyable
seasonal
ale
very
drinkable
too
i
normally
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
winter
warmers
because
theyre
overly
spiced
this
one
is
definitely
not
one
of
those
beers
like
i
said
previously
it
reminds
me
more
of
an
english
barleywine
very
enjoyable
and
well
balanced
first
beer
ive
had
from
highland
and
i
enjoy
it
well
enough
to
drink
the
whole
big
bottle
nice
mouthfeel
and
mediumbodied
a
very
nice
take
on
a
winter
warmer
and
im
feelin
fine
thanks
to
bhalter8
for
sending
this
along
poured
a
nice
amber
color
into
my
glass
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
smells
like
candy
more
specifically
candy
canes
its
very
subtle
but
noticeable
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
lots
of
candied
sugar
sweet
malts
with
hints
of
nutmeg
and
ginger
bread
its
not
overdone
or
trying
to
do
too
many
things
its
complex
but
blends
well
the
spices
are
right
on
not
too
overpowering
medium
body
excellent
mouthfeel
and
very
very
drinkable
this
is
by
far
the
best
winterseasonalspiced
beer
ive
had
to
date
another
very
pleasant
brew
from
highland
pours
mochalooking
body
with
some
offwhite
head
this
was
aged
somewhat
malty
with
some
roasted
malt
and
sweetish
spices
the
hops
are
understated
but
present
in
the
finish
tad
above
average
mouthfeel
drinkable
not
a
high
rating
of
outstanding
but
enjoyable
nevertheless
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
some
sourness
medium
to
low
carbonation
very
flavourful
and
hardy
a
nice
brown
ale
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
lighter
on
spices
than
many
winter
warmers
however
i
have
to
say
that
i
enjoy
it
more
than
many
winter
warmers
well
worth
a
shot
well
this
is
pretty
good
the
flavor
this
with
big
roasted
malt
characters
with
a
nutty
taste
in
addition
to
a
slightly
chocolate
aftertaste
at
one
point
this
reminds
me
of
kaluha
in
a
good
way
after
the
cocoa
taste
is
a
kind
of
creaminess
thats
blended
with
winter
spices
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
by
the
way
also
towards
the
beginning
of
the
flavor
profile
is
a
slightly
bitter
hop
bite
that
soon
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
crazy
malt
goodness
the
moth
feel
works
well
on
this
one
over
all
this
is
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
had
and
its
the
fullness
of
flavor
and
the
complexity
that
does
it
for
me
if
this
is
average
i
cant
wait
for
greatness
good
density
to
the
one
finger
head
mixture
of
all
bubble
sizes
dissolves
down
into
a
steady
half
finger
dark
cream
brown
in
hue
above
average
stickiness
to
the
lacing
mostly
copper
orange
colored
liquid
reddish
brick
tint
very
clear
and
holds
the
light
inside
well
light
cinnamon
ginger
to
anise
spice
swiftly
pretties
up
the
nose
the
caramel
notes
show
restraint
good
fullness
in
the
peach
apricot
fruit
scents
overall
just
unfolds
at
a
slow
relaxed
pace
nothing
flashy
fullbodied
the
carbonation
is
rich
and
broad
adding
to
its
creamy
mouthfeel
milk
chocolate
powder
hard
toffee
brown
sugar
and
sweet
baking
spices
dominate
flavorwise
however
its
really
just
not
that
sweet
wheat
germ
granola
notes
as
well
as
a
faint
stoniness
the
apricot
cherry
fruit
lower
here
but
more
floral
its
almost
a
cerebral
sort
of
beer
a
contemplator
which
one
assumes
is
the
intent
d
spiced
beers
require
a
delicate
touch
and
often
the
spices
dont
really
seem
like
they
improve
the
beer
unfortunately
this
one
steps
over
the
line
between
judicious
use
of
spices
and
becomes
a
cloying
mess
the
aroma
is
nice
with
distinct
malt
and
a
good
balance
of
spices
and
hops
the
flavor
starts
out
promising
but
falls
apart
by
the
finish
as
the
malt
becomes
cloying
and
the
spices
turn
astringent
i
really
tried
to
like
this
but
it
is
a
very
strange
beer
and
i
definitely
wont
be
drinking
it
again
taste
is
sweet
and
tart
with
a
nice
blend
of
earthy
hops
and
caramel
malts
finishes
nicely
with
spice
blended
into
the
grassy
and
earthy
hop
character
when
it
warms
a
little
the
sweet
malts
come
out
a
whole
lot
let
this
thing
get
to
around
55
degrees
and
enjoy
definitely
my
favorite
seasonal
this
year
again
interesting
ale
to
drink
aroma
is
not
much
to
talk
about
because
you
really
have
try
to
even
smell
it
taste
is
chocolate
and
caramel
mostly
with
slight
hoppiness
afterwards
with
a
bitter
chocolate
finish
nice
dark
amber
color
interesting
brew
but
not
highlands
best
word
of
warning
intense
chocolate
flavor
for
chocolate
lovers
mostly
hv
thanks
to
my
sister
for
getting
this
to
me
as
a
present
from
nc
this
was
a
great
beer
im
enjoying
it
a
little
late
in
the
season
but
i
will
be
requesting
this
again
in
the
future
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
in
a
while
lighter
body
than
i
expected
but
its
still
easily
medium
dry
finish
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
drinker
plush
feel
absolutely
no
alcohol
detected
im
definitely
going
back
to
buy
the
1
liter
swingtop
version
an
allaround
greater
winter
beer
from
my
favorite
local
brewery
i
hate
that
it
took
me
so
long
to
get
around
to
reviewing
it
but
its
still
very
enjoyable
overall
im
really
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
i
tend
to
rush
a
bit
in
my
reviewing
and
tried
to
slow
it
down
here
im
glad
i
did
thanks
again
turtlemoye
i
was
thrilled
to
receive
this
and
enjoyed
drinking
it
now
i
just
have
to
get
going
and
come
up
with
an
lif
of
my
own
cheers
d
pretty
drinkable
for
a
malt
bomb
the
slightly
thinner
feel
really
keeps
this
one
easier
on
the
drinking
with
this
having
such
a
sugary
malt
presence
it
doesnt
attack
your
palate
with
syrupy
coating
at
all
with
that
said
i
do
kinda
wish
this
had
a
bit
more
weight
and
was
crafted
into
a
bit
of
stout
still
its
a
great
beer
and
has
some
great
tastes
and
smells
overall
a
good
experience
but
i
could
absolutely
see
this
getting
better
thanks
to
deuane
for
sharing
a
bottle
of
this
at
his
recent
tasting
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
into
my
glass
and
appears
a
clear
deep
cooper
almost
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
the
aroma
and
taste
remind
me
of
an
orange
tootsie
pop
notes
of
caramel
and
cocoa
are
also
evident
the
taste
is
much
more
complex
than
the
nose
would
lead
you
to
believe
medium
bodied
and
satisfying
with
medium
carbonation
im
looking
forward
to
tracking
a
few
bottles
of
this
down
next
season
it
smells
like
reception
sticks
hit
is
very
sweet
with
a
strong
caramel
brown
ale
flavor
vanilla
bean
takes
over
in
the
finish
and
in
a
very
strong
fashion
if
you
dont
like
vanilla
stay
away
the
vanilla
really
overpowers
everything
else
for
me
and
takes
away
from
the
overall
flavor
drinkability
nothing
wrong
here
the
abv
is
low
i
think
the
bottle
said
5
6
flavors
and
aromas
strong
and
pleasant
warming
without
the
heat
and
the
mouthfeel
light
but
not
too
light
just
a
nice
easygoing
brew
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
syrupy
with
both
chocolate
and
maple
there
is
also
spices
caramel
and
vanilla
the
appearance
is
deep
amber
with
a
three
finger
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
there
are
a
lot
of
good
tastes
going
on
but
i
must
admit
they
come
in
stages
and
not
always
complimentary
the
palate
is
smooth
and
the
finish
bitter
overall
a
very
unique
winter
beer
i
was
really
blow
away
by
this
one
and
will
defiantly
look
for
it
again
next
year
a
great
winter
warmer
one
of
the
best
i
have
tried
this
is
good
stuff
from
a
brewery
that
became
one
of
my
two
favorite
beers
inthat
area
d
this
ones
pretty
drinkable
id
be
interested
to
find
out
what
the
abv
of
this
beer
is
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
all
that
high
so
it
is
a
pretty
solid
drinker
drinkability
excellent
bomber
not
really
what
i
expect
in
a
winter
warmer
but
still
delicious
very
much
like
a
cocoa
chai
latte
i
would
grade
it
higher
if
the
cocoa
didnt
leave
a
weird
lingering
aftertaste
fd
just
enough
on
the
fuller
medium
bodied
side
to
satisfy
amidst
the
snowy
winter
chill
yet
light
enough
to
remain
drinkable
around
the
fire
with
dinner
or
just
a
long
winter
day
trapped
indoors
light
soft
carbonation
adds
some
dimension
to
the
feel
filling
it
out
some
but
lost
early
in
each
sip
to
the
fading
drier
bitter
finish
drinks
easily
sip
after
sip
with
a
nice
malty
mouth
coating
that
isnt
too
heavy
but
leaves
a
lingering
want
for
more
after
a
while
though
the
flavor
becomes
somewhat
nondescript
the
aftertaste
resonating
with
pickled
beets
and
other
less
desirable
flavors
leaving
it
wanting
for
more
impressive
stand
out
character
a
seemingly
sessionable
winter
brew
though
the
unknown
abv
leaves
me
wondering
how
long
of
a
session
i
would
endure
looks
and
smells
the
part
of
a
tremendous
winter
warmer
but
the
taste
doesnt
quite
do
the
aroma
justice
its
still
a
good
brew
but
i
have
had
better
wws
pours
a
clear
amber
hue
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
colored
head
a
fair
amount
of
sticky
lacing
holds
on
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
rich
with
caramel
and
spicy
malts
a
touch
of
nutmeg
and
fresh
floral
hops
toasted
nuts
and
molasses
fill
the
nose
as
well
very
easy
winter
warmer
to
whiff
not
overly
spiced
at
all
taste
starts
off
sweet
with
sugar
cookies
terrys
chocolate
orange
and
a
dash
of
cinnamon
midway
some
grassy
hops
coconut
and
vanilla
extract
emerge
on
the
tongue
aftertaste
has
a
carmelized
almond
flavor
with
some
ginger
as
well
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
feel
and
a
lively
carbonation
i
was
really
expecting
much
going
into
this
beer
but
in
the
end
i
was
very
pleased
come
to
find
out
this
beer
is
the
1
winter
warmer
on
ba
and
for
good
reason
great
brew
thanks
for
the
extra
greg
wow
this
goes
down
easy
smoooth
creamy
malt
bill
followed
closely
by
a
nice
hint
o
hops
for
a
nice
clean
finish
hints
of
cola
sorghum
and
coconut
very
fresh
and
balanced
taste
i
have
been
impressed
with
the
few
highland
offerings
i
have
had
so
far
would
have
no
problem
buying
some
more
of
these
one
of
the
better
winter
seasonals
ive
had
redbrown
pour
nice
whiteish
head
reminded
me
a
little
like
drinking
a
windmill
cookie
with
some
caramel
toping
poured
over
it
had
this
on
draft
and
bottle
definetely
better
on
draft
also
i
liked
the
2007
version
a
little
bit
better
was
just
a
little
heavier
had
more
characteristics
of
a
christmas
porter
to
go
along
with
the
christmas
cookie
i
look
forward
to
next
years
batch
very
enjoyable
seasonal
brew
warm
and
festive
with
several
different
characteristics
noticeable
with
each
sip
making
you
want
one
drink
after
another
thick
and
malty
with
a
smooth
vanillalike
candy
finish
i
had
mine
at
barleys
taproom
in
knoxville
just
over
the
mountains
from
where
they
brew
the
beer
in
asheville
freshness
was
great
and
i
made
several
more
trips
back
to
taste
this
beer
my
wife
and
i
really
liked
this
beer
pours
a
lightmedium
copper
color
although
when
held
up
to
the
light
had
some
golden
to
it
smells
strongly
of
malt
and
slight
very
herbalness
taste
was
malty
and
had
a
sweet
aftertaste
almost
like
candy
sugar
taste
had
a
bit
of
ethanol
to
it
as
well
this
beer
went
great
with
dinner
drinkability
pretty
damned
tasty
brew
that
is
unlike
any
other
winter
warmer
ive
had
before
reminds
me
of
something
like
liquid
gingersnap
this
turned
out
to
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
that
i
really
enjoyed
wish
i
would
have
tried
it
fresh
as
i
assume
the
spices
would
have
popped
a
bit
more
thanks
again
walter
not
exactly
what
i
expected
from
a
winter
warmer
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
d
unlike
some
other
winter
warmers
ive
had
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
between
the
spiciness
and
lovely
dark
toasted
malt
im
glad
i
cracked
this
open
in
the
wintertime
and
it
feels
appropriate
to
the
season
were
i
to
order
at
a
pub
i
could
probably
have
2
possibly
3
pints
before
moving
on
the
body
is
between
moderate
and
full
leaves
a
malty
finish
but
isnt
too
sweet
nor
does
it
have
that
under
attenuated
feel
very
nice
malty
and
a
light
carbonation
to
back
it
overall
a
good
beer
with
some
minor
faults
dark
red
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
and
gives
good
lacing
wonderful
smells
of
cinnamon
clove
allspice
nutmeg
and
caramel
im
digging
the
taste
its
got
a
little
bit
of
hoppyness
for
balance
but
this
mostly
tastes
like
cinnamonsugar
bread
with
a
little
bit
of
allspice
and
a
caramel
finish
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
and
body
is
bordering
light
im
very
happy
with
this
beer
and
will
need
to
get
more
of
it
next
winter
great
job
highland
poured
a
double
deuce
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
light
tanish
brown
with
a
2
inch
head
that
leaves
a
pretty
decent
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
tulip
the
aroma
is
really
not
like
many
winter
warmers
that
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
its
more
on
the
camel
toffee
vanilla
side
then
on
any
of
the
spicy
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
spices
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
big
vanilla
and
toffee
notes
with
just
a
hint
of
watered
down
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
just
about
perfect
for
where
i
think
a
winter
warmer
should
be
nice
and
full
and
leaves
a
nice
oily
texture
on
the
palate
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
really
consider
a
winter
warmer
d
i
split
a
22oz
bomber
with
my
dad
on
christmas
eve
and
i
immediately
wished
we
each
had
our
own
bottle
this
is
a
fantastic
winter
ale
that
goes
down
smooth
and
warms
you
on
a
cold
night
while
its
not
light
by
any
means
it
seems
to
have
a
low
abv
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
a
very
good
beer
from
a
good
brewer
d
not
sure
about
abv
but
on
taste
id
not
drink
another
sorry
highland
poured
from
a22oz
bottle
nice
copper
caramel
color
with
a
white
thick
head
hints
of
toffee
and
cream
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
a
big
shot
of
creaminess
are
through
out
the
taste
the
body
is
mediumheavy
and
the
brew
just
coats
the
entire
mouth
a
little
filling
after
one
so
i
would
say
that
a
bomber
is
all
i
want
in
a
sitting
but
i
will
drink
at
least
once
a
year
if
i
get
my
hands
on
it
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
of
its
kind
check
it
out
if
you
get
a
chance
d
delicious
if
i
ever
find
my
way
into
one
of
those
ski
chalets
i
hear
so
much
about
ill
down
some
of
these
around
a
roaring
fire
overall
this
is
a
superb
offering
from
highland
imo
it
is
the
best
winter
warmer
out
there
i
hope
highland
brewing
keeps
this
years
recipe
as
the
new
standard
track
down
a
bottle
of
this
beer
any
way
you
can
you
will
not
be
disappointed
d
id
like
to
know
the
abv
on
this
i
had
two
of
them
on
an
empty
stomach
and
caught
a
little
buzz
but
it
is
a
fairly
easy
drinker
two
seemed
right
for
me
the
taste
is
more
balanced
than
i
expected
with
some
late
hop
bitterness
that
keeps
the
malts
in
check
the
texture
is
a
bit
oily
particularly
in
the
finish
vanilla
and
toasted
flavors
lead
the
way
here
but
if
anything
the
sweet
malt
is
understated
at
least
against
my
expectations
the
texture
is
smooth
with
a
warming
finish
alcohol
is
almost
invisible
i
wonder
what
the
abv
is
it
matters
not
youll
be
hard
pressed
to
find
too
many
winter
warmers
that
can
top
this
one
cheers
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
cookie
like
malt
character
then
some
spice
and
just
enough
bittering
to
create
a
great
flavor
of
well
a
really
good
beer
warming
alcohol
hits
the
belly
and
the
flavors
punch
as
the
beer
warms
this
beer
is
a
christmas
cookie
in
a
glass
this
is
too
good
i
dont
want
to
overanalyze
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
throughout
a
cold
december
night
heres
to
winter
and
a
great
beer
to
go
with
it
highlands
cold
mountain
winter
ale
is
mediumbodied
with
tingly
carbonation
smoothness
to
spare
and
superb
drinkability
a
nice
brew
id
enjoy
any
time
of
year
d
wish
i
had
shared
this
one
with
the
local
tasting
group
but
it
was
a
real
treat
to
enjoy
all
to
myself
one
of
the
best
holiday
beers
known
to
man
lots
of
spices
mostly
vanilla
also
clove
cinnamon
and
candi
sugar
the
vanilla
comes
through
the
most
but
it
all
blends
togethere
very
nicely
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
definitly
all
i
expected
cant
wait
have
some
more
at
lovely
christmas
dinner
with
family
and
friends
d
boozy
and
strong
this
is
not
a
quaffing
beer
spend
a
few
hours
getting
to
know
a
bottle
a
fluffy
three
finger
light
tan
head
has
nice
retention
leaving
scattered
lace
as
it
fades
body
is
an
incredibly
dark
brown
with
ruby
notes
when
held
to
light
nose
is
big
and
malty
with
some
rich
spicey
roasty
notes
candied
malts
awaken
the
taste
buds
on
first
sip
like
well
made
pie
crust
sprinkled
with
cinnamon
nicely
balanced
and
very
smooth
throughout
the
palate
a
wonderful
winter
brew
or
year
round
pleaser
for
that
matter
maybe
a
hint
of
cherry
pie
filling
also
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
on
the
sweet
side
i
would
love
to
have
lots
of
these
in
my
fridge
notes
a
big
thanks
to
loki
for
this
one
i
think
i
just
found
my
new
favorite
winter
warmer
pours
a
red
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
creaminess
of
the
head
makes
for
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
too
smells
all
malty
and
sugary
tastes
the
sweet
with
a
weird
chocolatey
taste
seriously
aftertaste
its
good
terribly
drinkable
as
well
wow
this
is
just
one
tasty
winter
warmer
the
sweetness
works
just
right
never
gets
to
be
over
the
top
and
keeps
the
drikibility
right
on
target
nice
stuff
pours
a
clear
ruby
copper
color
with
12
inch
of
thick
creamtan
colored
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
brown
sugar
caramel
cinnamon
dough
and
a
slight
hop
presence
much
like
a
liquid
churro
big
toffee
taste
mixes
with
cinnamon
clove
caramel
sugar
and
spicy
hops
for
an
incredible
flavor
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
smooth
and
spicy
with
lots
of
toffee
and
holiday
spices
quite
a
nice
winter
warmer
very
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
but
not
too
sickening
a
perfect
blend
of
flavors
drinkability
big
sweetness
and
nice
spiciness
this
is
what
i
want
a
winter
warmer
to
taste
like
though
the
style
is
very
diverse
and
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
spiced
variety
highly
recommended
overall
a
fare
drinker
on
a
winters
day
glad
to
have
the
chance
and
would
purchase
if
i
could
rich
maroon
brown
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
smell
is
sweet
malt
vanilla
cream
and
perhaps
some
butteriness
or
butterscotch
kind
of
reminds
me
of
scotch
ales
which
im
not
too
keen
on
taste
is
smooth
vanilla
cream
and
caramelly
malt
a
good
beer
in
all
honesty
but
something
about
the
strong
sweet
vanilla
like
aroma
that
was
a
bit
cloying
or
unpleasant
to
me
the
drink
ability
is
very
good
i
real
nice
top
notch
example
of
this
diverse
style
prosit
mk
m
dthis
was
a
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
ale
im
not
much
for
spices
but
this
was
very
good
recommended
a
very
enjoyable
winter
warmer
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
i
must
say
d
very
easy
to
drink
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
winter
warmer
but
delicious
none
the
less
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
for
a
winter
warmer
but
it
does
go
down
very
smoothly
even
and
mild
carbonation
and
slightly
sticky
on
the
lips
the
abv
also
seems
a
little
mild
for
a
warmer
but
it
seems
to
enhance
drinkability
it
would
be
nice
to
session
this
d
i
enjoyed
this
first
time
around
and
tried
a
second
pint
and
well
had
some
issues
finishing
it
the
spices
are
too
sweet
and
overpowering
drinking
too
much
of
this
i
liked
this
but
drinkability
was
severely
limited
for
me
after
first
pint
it
was
just
too
much
of
too
sweet
md
medium
bodied
mostly
creamy
but
also
a
little
slick
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
alcohol
is
apparent
on
a
good
way
drinkability
is
fine
on
this
one
as
it
is
smooth
and
relatively
easy
drinking
excellent
winter
warmer

lots
of

immediate
aroma
is
cinnamon
as
it
warms
nutmeg
caramel
notes
appear
taste
matches
with
cinnamon
being
the
strongest
some
nutmeg
caramel
vanilla
flavors
too
this
needs
to
be
at
room
temperature
to
loosen
the
flavors
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
a
winter
beer
still
very
similar
to
so
many
fall
pumpkin
beers
highland
is
an
underappreciated
brewery
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
christmasseasonal
ales
poured
out
of
the
big
fliptop
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
its
translucent
dark
ambercopper
with
a
slight
head
nose
is
delicious
biscuity
malts
and
caramel
with
gingerbread
and
vanilla
icing
very
good
combination
of
aromas
taste
is
nutty
with
cinnamon
like
those
windmill
cookies
malts
linger
for
a
while
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
and
drinkability
is
high
especially
when
compared
to
many
winter
warmers
that
have
cloying
alcohol
or
overwhelming
cloves
and
nutmeg
another
great
brew
from
highland
very
interesting
and
very
nice
drinks
like
a
fine
cognac
glad
i
have
a
1l
hammer
bottle
of
this
great
brew
i
will
have
to
get
another
one
to
see
if
i
get
the
same
response
to
finished
this
review
i
cant
believe
of
the
disappointment
after
waiting
a
year
for
it
at
first
i
though
this
would
be
a
pretty
low
to
average
beer
judging
by
the
look
and
smell
of
it
the
flavor
is
out
of
this
world
though
i
recommend
it
i
have
a
growler
of
last
years
cold
mountain
waiting
to
be
sampled
look
for
a
review
of
that
precious
volume
to
note
how
well
that
vintage
aged
overall
very
tasty
excellent
winter
beer
glad
ac
was
on
eh
drinkability
is
hard
to
determine
too
much
vanilla
this
is
the
kissing
cousin
of
cream
soda
this
is
a
beer
where
one
flavor
has
really
has
really
taken
over
real
simple
a
beer
for
vanilla
lovers
period
overall
this
was
a
little
bit
bigger
then
i
had
expected
i
would
not
say
it
dissapointed
me
not
at
all
on
a
cold
night
i
would
love
to
throw
one
of
these
back
in
fact
i
really
look
forward
to
the
first
autumn
chill
and
will
have
to
invite
over
the
family
to
crack
the
other
bottle
i
purchased
but
as
an
all
winter
long
session
beer
a
bit
too
strong
for
that
all
and
all
a
good
brew
with
some
nice
inginuity
from
the
boys
over
at
highland
the
quality
of
the
brewing
going
on
in
western
noth
carolina
continues
to
impress
me
i
always
appreciate
thinking
outside
the
box
and
also
in
cases
like
this
where
you
just
put
you
own
twist
on
a
classic
warmer
well
done
and
definatly
worth
a
try
overall
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
perhaps
it
is
past
its
prime
either
way
i
couldnt
finish
it
d
a
very
good
winter
warmer
that
truly
tastes
like
a
holiday
beer
a
little
much
for
me
to
drink
more
than
a
bottle
but
would
make
a
nice
sipper
by
a
warm
fire
d
quite
an
enjoyable
winter
brew
even
just
days
before
summer
this
one
was
still
satisfying
and
delicious
ive
read
that
the
brew
recipe
changes
each
year
but
ill
attest
to
the
the
fact
that
the
2006
batch
was
good
and
was
still
drinkable
as
of
june
2007
thanks
for
sending
this
one
brent
this
beer
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
thick
head

tight
bubbles
the
aroma
is
malty
the
taste
is
malty
and
has
a
pumpkin
spice
taste
it
also
is
very
reminiscent
of
syrup

this
tastes
like
something
one
should
have
for
breakfast
waffles
the
mouthfeel
is
full
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
id
recommend
tasting
but
wouldnt
call
highly
drinkable
the
finish
is
on
the
bitterish
side
with
flavours
of
hot
cocoa
and
it
leaves
a
pleasing
long
lasting
aftertaste
im
not
getting
too
much
warming
so
either
the
abv
is
fairly
low
or
its
really
well
hidden
a
very
nice
drop
indeed
im
glad
i
got
this
one
in
the
trade
drinkability
the
high
levels
of
spice
require
slow
sipping
and
i
can
only
get
through
one
or
two
bottles
before
ive
had
enough
while
its
an
amazing
beer
and
quite
drinkable
for
a
spiced
winter
ale
this
style
in
particular
requires
moderate
consumption
all
in
all
an
amazing
and
unique
beer
and
one
that
ill
be
looking
for
every
winter
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tannish
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
sweet
malty
and
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
much
slightly
dry
finish
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
little
ww
but
not
that
high
in
alcohol
content
poured
it
has
a
lovely
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
aroma
is
spicy
with
a
strong
hint
of
cinnamon
the
pleasant
zingy
taste
is
malty
with
spice
hints
and
very
little
bitterness
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
very
satisfying
this
holiday
beer
is
a
delight
any
time
of
the
year
good
by
itself
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
light
meal
a
soothing
drinker
of
a
winter
warmer
subtle
malty
with
an
infused
quality
of
bakery
fresh
doughnut
toppings
and
fillings
nice
stuff
nice
dark
chestnut
color
most
of
the
head
fades
quick
but
leaves
a
nice
lacing
smells
of
sweet
caramel
toasted
malts
maybe
a
rich
nutty
spiked
chai
nice
clean
aroma
tastes
like
it
smells
big
and
malty
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
smokey
aftertaste
almost
a
red
grape
skin
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorites
drinks
so
easy
a
really
pleasant
winter
warmer
one
i
think
i
could
session
on
ill
buy
this
if
i
ever
see
it
again
drinkability
i
split
the
16
oz
and
that
was
plenty
not
a
huge
fan
on
the
whole
not
beery
enough
for
me
i
suppose
very
drinkable
beer
well
made
and
very
interesting
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
certainly
worth
a
try
wow
i
was
certain
this
beer
was
gone
for
this
year
when
my
friends
and
i
visited
tylers
taproom
in
carboro
and
found
they
still
had
this
on
draft
the
waitress
said
they
had
pulled
it
aside
several
times
so
they
would
have
it
later
than
anyone
else
the
beer
possessed
a
deep
rich
ruby
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
was
moderately
diminishing
and
left
very
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
layers
of
malts
with
some
mild
spices
present
as
well
the
taste
presented
a
very
complex
spice
variety
on
top
of
a
great
malt
backbone
there
was
a
presence
of
both
vanilla
and
dried
fruit
the
mouthfeel
was
low
in
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
by
the
spice
blend
this
is
a
very
great
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
i
just
wish
it
was
available
in
stores
for
more
than
2
to
3
weeks
each
year
amber
color
nice
body
and
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
whose
flavor
absolutely
changes
and
gets
better
with
age
save
this
years
beer
in
a
cool
place
and
drink
it
next
winter
and
you
will
see
what
i
mean
the
smooth
flavor
has
a
distinctive
chocolate
finish
d
this
beer
could
have
gone
either
way
with
that
much
vanillabutterscotch
flavor
it
could
easilly
be
cloying
artificial
or
overbearing
the
fact
that
i
killed
an
entire
22oz
without
the
sugar
weighing
on
me
speaks
volumes
one
of
the
more
under
rated
winter
warmers
on
the
market
a
beer
that
doesnt
get
much
publicity
its
very
similar
to
the
winter
solstice
from
anderson
valley
but
blows
it
out
of
the
water
this
was
probably
the
second
best
domestic
winter
warmer
i
had
this
year
poured
a
very
pretty
dark
red
color
with
a
solid
half
inch
head
that
faded
after
a
couple
of
minutes
aroma
smell
of
nutmeg
vanilla
clove
and
other
spices
the
aroma
was
very
faint
however
barely
detectable
taste
was
of
the
same
spices
mentioned
above
along
with
some
flavors
of
caramel
cherries
and
of
all
things
root
beer
for
some
reason
i
kept
tasting
root
beer
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
easy
drinking
i
was
quite
disappointed
with
this
beer
for
a
spiced
winter
brew
i
expect
something
with
more
body
and
flavor
the
spices
were
very
muted
and
just
didnt
jump
out
at
me
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
however
just
a
little
thin
in
body
for
my
taste
drinkability
interesting
and
wellmade
but
not
particularly
to
my
liking
edit
ive
had
this
several
times
from
bottle
since
and
really
i
still
dislike
it
ah
well
this
would
be
great
for
or
with
dessert
deep
brownish
red
with
a
fluffy
soapy
head
smells
exactly
like
frosting
covered
gingerbread
cookies
wow
sweet
malty
flavor
nicely
layered
with
ginger
and
other
spices
mapley
figs
rich
and
complex
solid
mouthfeel
with
a
fullish
body
and
light
carbonation
pretty
darn
tasty
winter
ale
excellent
on
tap
as
well
if
you
can
find
it
this
was
a
little
darker
and
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
poured
a
crystal
clear
dark
orange
bronze
colour
big
soapy
frothy
khaki
coloured
head
hung
around
for
a
while
it
looked
pretty
nice
smell
was
fairly
hoppy
and
a
little
sweet
sweet
grain
actually
taste
was
completely
different
than
i
had
expected
based
on
smell
bitter
citrus
hops
up
front
quickly
quelled
by
sweet
toasted
malty
flavours
delicious
actually
i
was
quite
surprised
i
liked
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
must
say
im
quite
surprised
d
easy
drinking
tasty
drinking
yes
ill
have
another
a
winter
brew
that
even
at
22oz
has
you
considering
a
second
bottle
pours
clear
coppertinged
brown
with
thin
creamy
tan
head
and
great
lace
retention
smells
enticingly
spicy
and
doughy
primarily
orange
ginger
cinnamon
and
anise
on
a
cookie
and
caramel
malt
base
flavor
strongly
favors
the
christmas
spices
doughy
anise
ginger
and
orange
are
dominant
notes
and
form
something
of
a
lessfruity
liquid
fruitcake
finishes
with
gently
drying
hop
touches
big
black
pepper
and
cinnamon
nicely
balanced
body
keeps
this
easydrinking
throughout
very
good
and
the
best
of
the
highland
brews
ive
sampled
so
far
easily
the
most
drinkable
winter
ale
i
have
had
due
to
its
smoothness
and
outstanding
taste
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
get
this
then
buy
it
its
fantastic
i
got
a
22oz
bomber
of
2006
cold
mountain
from
greenlife
in
asheville
sat
down
after
dinner
with
a
fire
going
in
a
cabin
on
a
cold
mountain
night
poured
a
decent
looking
dark
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
head
smelled
like
a
winter
warmer
nothing
too
suprising
but
nice
but
when
i
tasted
it
i
was
assaulted
with
nutmegspice
flavor
way
out
of
balance
with
the
beer
part
vanilla
too
i
think
the
malt
flavor
that
was
there
was
nice
just
covered
up
by
spice
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
contrary
to
what
the
smell
and
appearance
would
have
you
think
i
honestly
couldnt
believe
how
unbalanced
this
beer
tasted
maybe
thats
what
theyre
going
for
a
lot
of
you
seem
to
like
it
i
could
only
get
through
half
of
it
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
sorry
to
all
who
cant
find
it
i
got
this
years
taste
from
the
weinhaus
in
asheville
hard
to
come
by
but
well
worth
it
loved
it
better
than
last
years
enjoyed
the
hazelnut
flavor
not
crazy
about
all
the
vanilla
especially
with
the
after
taste
smell
and
drinkability
are
absolutly
delicious
i
have
had
this
in
both
the
bottle
and
on
draft
prefer
bottle
but
since
thats
all
gone
draft
will
have
to
do
usual
suspects
is
my
favorite
draft
spot
for
this
beer
they
keep
it
nice
and
cold
and
still
have
some
left
pours
dark
brown
with
a
light
head
and
no
real
lacing
looks
a
little
richer
than
it
turns
out
to
be
smells
of
soft
vanilla
and
hazlenuts
a
little
sweet
on
the
nose
taste
has
a
lot
of
vanilla
up
front
probably
too
much
followed
by
some
soft
hops
and
a
final
malt
creaminess
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
there
is
a
nice
creaminess
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
this
feels
a
little
simplistic
and
not
the
classic
i
was
hoping
for
d
an
interesting
offering
and
one
that
im
glad
i
trieda
bit
off
the
course
for
me
though
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
and
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
wonderful
flavors
and
a
bit
complex
drinkability
an
enjoyable
beer
with
a
somewhat
unique
flavor
profile
but
not
one
that
you
can
drink
in
quantity
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
mildly
spiced
along
with
a
light
sourness
that
fades
into
a
wild
spiced
and
hopped
finish
cheers
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
flavorful
brew
and
one
more
reason
why
i
like
winter
seasonals
so
much
its
not
something
id
want
to
drink
as
an
everyday
brew
but
as
something
special
that
comes
around
once
a
year
this
is
certainly
something
special
too
bad
it
was
92
degrees
outside
in
the
sun
at
a
bbq
when
i
had
this
absolutely
delectable
my
favorite
highland
brew
so
far
not
just
a
nice
smell
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
but
the
same
taste
as
well
even
on
the
colder
side
the
flavors
really
come
out
would
love
to
get
a
whole
bunch
of
this
six
months
from
now
overall
an
exceptional
winter
beer
worthy
of
a
cold
night
or
any
other
night
for
that
matter
this
is
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
no
matter
the
cost
i
have
yet
to
have
an
even
mediocre
beer
from
highland
and
this
exceeds
all
expectaion
just
darn
great
bottle
22oz
pours
a
deep
red
with
hardly
any
head
scents
of
spice
on
the
nose
delicious
spiced
fruit
cake
with
some
marshmellows
and
vanilla
flavoring
maybe
my
favorite
winter
to
this
point
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
thanks
to
derrickt007
for
the
bottle
cmwa
is
a
uniquely
flavored
beer
from
what
ive
decided
is
the
best
brewery
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
since
winters
in
the
tar
heel
state
dont
come
close
to
resembling
winters
in
the
upper
midwest
theres
no
need
to
create
a
heavy
high
alcohol
ale
to
warm
the
natives
an
amazingly
delicious
one
like
cold
mountain
will
suffice
quite
nicely
as
for
the
drinkability
uncleflip
put
it
best
when
he
said
i
had
to
keep
taking
sips
to
keep
finding
more
flavours
in
it
how
true
for
me
the
bomber
i
had
tonight
was
just
the
right
amount
aroma
is
very
toffee
sweet
and
malty
giving
a
mere
hint
of
its
true
nature
at
the
first
taste
the
cold
mountain
is
lightly
nutty
almond
and
hazelnut
to
me
and
pleasantly
sweet
with
a
dash
of
spice
and
a
pleasant
vanilla
character
just
a
trace
of
hop
presence
lingers
in
the
foreground
as
well
with
a
bit
of
apple
nudging
its
way
in
there
body
is
on
the
full
side
of
medium
and
this
brew
is
exceedingly
drinkable
finish
is
clean
and
malty
sweet
i
think
i
could
drink
many
pints
of
this
one
this
is
a
beer
that
is
just
plain
good
without
being
extreme
in
any
way
aroma
is
complex
and
hard
to
crack
there
is
some
marzipan
with
light
almonds
cocoa
white
cake
lots
of
subtle
fruit
notes
and
a
very
bready
maltiness
color
is
amber
with
a
rich
creamy
tan
head
fore
is
full
of
sweet
candied
fruits
raspberry
cherry
dominate
and
that
is
followed
by
more
sweet
malts
chocolate
and
cherry
linger
in
the
aftertaste
its
simply
tasty
and
approachable
would
be
a
great
holiday
beer
to
give
to
frieds
thanks

drinkability
very
drinkable
may
be
next
year
they
can
pump
up
the
recipe
to
the
next
level
now
that
the
cap
has
been
popped
mouthfeel
could
be
a
touch
thicker
but
does
a
good
job
coating
the
mouth
well
to
let
the
spices
come
though
drinkablity
is
great
this
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
with
a
nice
crispness
drinkability
is
very
good
i
wish
this
was
offered
all
year
long

taste
is
what
make
this
beer

one
in
my
book

i
would
go
out

a
brownamber
color
with
a
small
head
that
hangs
around
nicely
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
wonderful
balance
of
diacetyl
chocolate
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
right
on
with
the
aroma
lots
of
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
diacetyl
that
reminds
me
of
marshmallows

the
light
end
of
thick
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
uf
this
is
highlands

effort
i
wish
this
was
a
yearround
offering
the
appearance
is
a
nice
mahogony
color
it
had
a
decent
head
the
smell
is
a
sweet
fruity
smell
the
taste
is
of
caramel
it
has
a
sweet
taste
to
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
second
to
none
there
is
no
negative
aftertaste
no
bite
nothing
but
smoothness
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
you
can
bet
your
ass
i
will
be
finding
some
more
before
the
supply
runs
out
a
good
winter
warmer
hop
bitterness
and
sweet
smooth
character
of
the
malts
sweetness
and
tartness
of
the
spices
thank
you

have
another
this
offering

has
me
longing
to
be
in
my

tunes
on
the
ol
bagpipe
and
a
gallon
of
this
sweet
nectar

my
kilt

drinkable
i
wish

more
although
at
11
for
a
litre
i
suppose
its
not
a
bad
deal
this
beer
is
unlike
anything
else
i
have
ever
had
incredibly
unique
i
feel
the
sum
of
its
component
parts
while
recognizable
add
up
to
something
greater
creating
new
flavors
i
poured
my
entire
1
liter
bottle
into
my
1l
german
stein
its
a
clear
ruby
auburn
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
foam
tastes
like
candy
smells
sweet
of
cherries
some
brown
sugar
and
a
faint
bitter
twinge
taste
upfront
is
sourmarashino
cherries
but
minus
the
incredible
sweetness
then
a
solid
bitterness
emerges
preventing
anything
from
becoming
cloying
in
the
meantime
flavor
really
depends
on
what
you
focus
on
theres
brown
sugar
more
cherry
some
vanilla
theres
some
faint
smokiness
and
an
incredible
interplay
thereof
the
flavors
really
work
well
together
bitterness
keeps
everything
in
check
the
finish
lingers
for
quite
a
while
very
smooth
almost
a
buttery
finish
yet
not
diacetyl
i
wont
guess
as
to
the
spices
used
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
relatively
low
carbonation
making
it
very
chewy
very
drinkable
this
is
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
im
exercising
restraint
in
not
popping
open
my
second
liter
many
thanks
to
merlin48
for
this
very
hard
to
find
beer
body
is
medium
or
just
shy
of
smooth
and
very
creamy
texture
a
very
solid
winter
warmer
and
one
i
will
be
going
back
to
pours
a
pretty
medium
dark
amber
with
a
1
finger
beige
head
and
very
good
lace
nice
smells
are
there
although
they
are
faint
brown
sugar
cinnamon
raisin
this
beer
is
like
nothing
i
have
ever
had
before
i
get
a
big
vanilla
flavor
mixed
with
some
brown
sugar
allspice
and
raisin
leaves
a
unusual
but
good
bitterness
on
the
tounge
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
smooth
and
complex
nicely
balanced
very
unique
get
some
of
this
if
you
get
a
chance
pours
an
beautiful
mahogany
brown
with
some
ruby
tints
around
the
edges
and
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
retains
well
the
aroma
is
just
as
impressive
with
big
chocolate
notes
some
incredible
spice
character
cinammon
nutmeg
clove
allspice
along
with
some
gingerbread
pumpkin
sweet
potato
brown
sugar
and
some
light
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
slightly
more
subdued
than
the
aroma
but
is
still
impressive
some
gingerbread
sweet
potato
brown
sugar
chocolate
pumpkernickel
bread
spices
cinammon
nutmeg
clove
allspice
and
some
light
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
drinkability
is
good
an
excellent
beer
from
highland
definately
lives
up
to
the
hype
im
glad
i
could
pick
some
up
before
its
gone
this
year
2011
fairly
consistent
with
years
past
a
christmas
classic
for
the
home
state
i
will
add
that
now
that
its
described
on
the
bottle
theres
an
evident
hazelnut
aroma
picked
up
a
bomber
at
bottle
revolution
in
raleigh
gonna
let
the
old
scores
stand
the
2005
cold
mountain
is
complex
and
enigmatic
lots
of
things
going
on
here
that
are
beyond
my
limited
comprehension
but
this
is
an
exceptional
experience
very
unique
very
tasty
and
an
absolute
pleasue
to
drink
i
spent
an
hour
with
this
liter
and
enjoyed
every
sip
very
smooth
and
goes
down
way
too
easy
so
tasty
i
was
tempted
to
crack
open
another
liter
would
love
to
have
a
keg
of
this
for
a
christmas
party
somewhere
after
its
release
from
the
1
liter
swing
top
brown
bottle
it
resides
in
the
glass
a
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
to
copper
color
with
a
moderate
in
size
frothy
light
tan
head
that
erodes
rather
quickly
leaving
a
satisfactory
sheet
of
lace
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
vanilla
nutlike
caramel
corn
also
comes
to
mind
and
fresh
and
appetizing
start
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
decent
grain
presence
and
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
benignly
acidic
with
a
delightful
hop
spiciness
and
quite
dry
aftertaste
a
quite
drinkable
beer
that
i
savored
over
a
couple
of
days
this
beer
is
an
example
of
flavors
that
are
well
balanced
and
complimentary
none
of
the
flavors
rise
to
dominance
or
fade
under
pressure
from
other
flavors
instead
they
tumble
around
like
vegetables
in
a
simmering
stew
dancing
along
the
surface
and
bumping
gently
into
others
sending
each
off
in
a
new
direction
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
and
am
already
thinking
about
how
i
might
get
a
case
of
this
when
its
next
released
what
could
be
better
for
a
midsummer
morning
drinkability
i
was
a
bit
sad
that
i
had
only
one
bottle
of
this
to
drink
since
finishing
this
bottle
i
keep
wishing
i
had
more
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
dinner
i
paired
it
with
some
bbq
chicken
rice
pilaf
and
green
salad
and
this
beer
complimented
it
all
very
well
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
of
it
drinkability
is
good
very
sweet
which
makes
tough
to
put
down
a
lot
but
very
good
first
and
foremost
this
is
one
killer
looking
bottle
if
i
do
say
so
myself
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
slight
ruby
hues
and
a
nice
head
that
leaves
a
slight
lace
mixes
of
toffees
caramels
hints
of
roasted
malts
and
bits
of
earthy
spices
make
up
the
aromas
to
this
brew
there
are
also
some
toasted
notes
and
what
reminds
me
of
walnuts
of
chestnuts
flavors
are
a
heavy
dosage
of
malts
throughout
with
a
really
powering
kick
of
toffees
and
toasted
malts
that
just
blend
together
ever
so
nicely
there
are
hints
of
caramels
in
the
mix
in
almost
a
scotch
ale
sort
of
flavor
along
with
some
nutty
flavors
are
just
a
slight
hint
of
spices
the
finish
is
very
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
bits
of
toffee
overall
this
brew
was
highly
drinkable
and
had
a
great
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
unfortunately
for
me
this
was
my
only
bottle
of
this
fantastic
brew
but
at
least
i
get
to
quaff
it
all
by
myself
get
this
beer
if
you
can
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
light
tan
head
above
a
deep
copper
brew
head
shrinks
pretty
quickly
but
still
eaves
a
coating
of
uneven
bubbles
and
lacing
is
average
aroma
is
sweetly
of
malts
coupled
with
a
seemingly
peat
component
not
smoky
more
of
an
earthy
contribution
there
maybe
their
yeast
strain
never
had
anything
from
highland
before
taste
is
a
combination
of
sweet
maltiness
earthy
tones
and
possibly
a
vanilla
bean
or
two
certainly
a
lot
going
on
here
but
it
all
comes
together
nicely
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
excellent
nice
offering
here
with
a
cool
package
and
a
pleasing
product
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
dissapears
and
leaves
spotty
lace
the
aroma
is
big
on
malt
caramel
sugary
coated
fruits
plums
raisins
and
figs
with
a
touch
of
spice
taste
is
big
on
flavor
molasses
like
nice
and
sweet
big
on
malt
with
fruit
entering
in
the
middle
and
finishing
with
light
spice
and
candy
also
some
vanilla
flavors
lingering
mouthfeel
while
not
full
feels
big
lots
of
sugary
malt
flowing
over
the
taste
buds
imparting
sweetness
drinkability
is
good
glad
it
comes
in
liter
bottles
gives
you
plenty
to
enjoy
hopefully
next
year
it
will
be
stronger
with
the
6
cap
gone
a
nice
little
winter
warmer
can
see
why
they
sell
so
fast
glad
i
was
able
to
find
me
a
couple
pours
a
deep
brilliant
ruby
red
with
some
brown
highlights
small
offwhite
head
lingers
around
the
rim
rich
sweet
malty
aroma
with
accents
of
raisins
and
brown
sugar
the
first
sip
made
me
smile
a
lot
sweet
subtle
malt
character
up
front
mellows
into
deeper
roasted
malt
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
lingering
notes
of
raisin
brown
sugar
and
a
faint
bit
of
toffee
body
is
substantial
but
not
too
thick
or
syrupy
yielding
to
a
pleasant
smooth
foam
very
drinkable
for
a
winter
warmer
also
damn
this
may
be
the
best
beer
ive
had
that
was
brewed
in
nc
as
an
aside
this
was
an
almost
perfect
complement
to
the
slice
of
applepecanwalnut
pie
i
had
for
dessert
thanks
to
gcbrewingco
for
the
sample
pours
a
deep
amberruby
color
with
an
ambertan
head
thick
aromas
of
syrupy
malt
waft
from
my
glass
i
also
get
notes
of
caramelized
oranges
and
cherries
which
are
strong
enough
that
there
might
actually
be
some
cherry
additions
to
this
beer
the
taste
is
dry
up
front
but
then
moves
to
a
weird
fruity
note
cough
syrup
perhaps
this
also
has
some
interesting
subdued
dark
malt
character
to
it
a
slightly
acidic
finish
as
well
as
some
candied
cherry
notes
the
cherry
is
not
nearly
as
strong
in
the
taste
as
in
the
aroma
up
front
this
beer
could
just
about
pass
for
a
malty
scottish
ale
it
is
fairly
light
and
interesting
enough
as
a
quaffing
brew
good
thing
that
i
have
a
1
liter
bottle
of
this
to
enjoy
thanks
to
aksmokedporter

bif

for
this

i
admit
i
started
by
giving
this
one
a
3
8
but
as
it
warmed
wow
so
many
tastes
came
out
that
i
just
had
to
adjust
my
scores
im
surprised
that
a
sub6
beer
can
be
this
complex
but
somehow
it
manages
quite
good
and
this
is
one
id
likely
have
again
drinkability

this
was
very
complex
yet
amazingly
smooth
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
definitely
a
big
creamy

beer
we
have
here
thick

drinkability
is
definitely
a
5
0
so
very
wellbalanced
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
im
very
very
glad
to
have
finally
been
able
to
try
this
gem
from
north
carolina
if
in
a
few
years
the
abv
limit
is
raised
this
would
be
a
candidate
for
pumping
up
the
abv
and
see
what
happens
seek
this
one
out
gang
youll
be
glad
you
did
notes
this
beer
is
begging
for
north
carolinas
abv
laws
to
change
i
think
its
a
good
beer
now
but
the
depth
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
is
impressive
for
a
beer
under
6
one
of
highlands
strongest
offerings
major
big
props
to
disclosednot
for
hookin
me
up
with
the
cold
mountain
he
saved
me
from
a
deep
depression
of
not
being
able
to
find
this
stuff
anywhere
thanks
bro
a
huge
thank
you
to
aksmokedporter
for
tracking
this
one
down
thanks
to
loki
for
letting
us
know
where
to
get
the
beer
and
beerinator
for
picking
it
up
taste
needs
a
bit
of
a
sweet
burn
in
the
finish
to
make
it
perfect
in
my
experience
this
beer
is
only
available
in
32oz
1l
swing
top
bottles
during
the
winter
months
fairly
well
spiced
this
beer
is
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
pie
both
in
smell
and
taste
definately
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
feel
it
could
be
made
more
so
by
increasing
the
quantity
of
malts
and
holding
the
spice
level
the
same
however
this
wouldnt
work
in
nc
because
this
beer
is
already
close
to
the
6
alcohol
level
the
state
has
set
as
a
limit
for
all
beer
which
is
ridiculous
found
this
one
at
old
town
draught
house
here
in
greensboro
nice
darker
auburn
color
with
nice
creamy
head
real
nice
smell
of
nutmeg
and
other
spices
with
fruity
tonessmelled
very
appetizing
something
to
warm
up
to
for
sure
good
and
heartymedium
bodied
not
to
heavy
so
pretty
easy
to
drink
good
winter
style
ale
from
a
good
craft
brewer
down
here
2001
version
1
liter
swingtop
bottle
tasted
112302
it
says
right
on
the
bottle
that
its
a
red
ale
and
it
sure
tastes
like
other
red
ales
ive
had
though
perhaps
less
bitter
i
was
under
the
impression
that
winter
warmers
were
generally
more
related
to
brown
ales
i
didnt
really
detect
any
additional
spices
oh
well
either
way
it
was
delicious
used
a
large
shortstemmed
belgian
style
flute
for
lack
of
a
better
term
i
perceived
various
shades
of
amber
a
slight
but
seductive
haziness
although
that
may
have
been
from
how
cold
it
was
when
served
aromatically
it
seemed
more
akin
to
some
black
ales
that
ive
had
than
to
a
pale
or
an
ipa
a
very
sweet
perfumy
hoppiness
sweeter
but
with
a
stronger
flavor
profile
than
many
a
pale
or
even
some
ipas
again
reminiscent
of
certain
of
the
black
ale
style
rich
somewhat
thick
head
was
there
to
stay
overall
winter
warmer
or
black
ipa
either
way
this
is
certainly
flavorful
all
of
the
aspects
go
together
pretty
well
although
i
wish
i
had
gotten
it
a
bit
fresher
considering
how
cheap
widmer
is
in
stores
it
is
worth
trying
overall
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
driest
beers
ive
ever
had
is
this
really
supposed
to
be
this
way
wish
i
could
find
a
date
on
this
somewhere
on
the
bottle
most
likely
not
come
back
to
this
pretty
good
basically
a
quality
nw
pale
ale
with
some
spice
plus
a
bit
of
extra
maltiness
and
body
for
how
spiced
it
is
id
say
it
is
imbalanced
toward
the
bitter
side
due
to
the
generous
hoppage
but
it
would
be
perfect
with
a
pizza
and
a
fun
crowd
after
a
days
skiing
a
good
smooth
beer
not
too
filling
tastes
great
but
its
other
qualities
bring
it
down
a
notch
these
are
a
little
hazy
when
served
very
cold
but
they
brighten
right
up
when
they
warm
up
i
let
my
current
bottle
sit
out
for
20
minutes
or
so
and
it
pours
brilliant
ruby
tinted
dark
amber
under
a
1
offwhite
foam
cap
with
a
slight
tan
tint
it
leaves
thick
lace
on
the
glass
the
malt
aromas
recall
fruit
cake
with
caramel
light
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
leading
to
a
bitter
emphasis
on
the
finish
with
some
mild
alcohol
warming
its
creamy
medium
full
body
and
medium
carbonation
pours
a
pretty
amber
in
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
ringlike
lacing
was
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
full
or
caramel
malts
spice
and
some
citrus
zest
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
there
is
a
hint
of
pine
also
good
taste
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
for
this
style
of
brew
overall
it
is
a
decent
brew
widmer
crafted
a
nice
beer
here
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
arent
overly
exciting
nothing
too
special
but
not
bad
a
nice
coppery
red
color
as
poured
into
the
glass
slight
citrus
hop
aromas
mix
with
the
caramel
malt
to
create
a
pleasing
aroma
pretty
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
good
balance
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
to
keep
it
very
smooth
no
spices
in
this
one
but
a
great
taste
overall
the
brrr
is
a
decent
beer
starts
slightly
sweet
then
finishes
bitter
the
beer
poured
a
nice
amber
with
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
beer
is
hoppier
than
expected
and
the
bitterness
at
the
end
is
no
overly
positive
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
its
solid
and
worth
a
try
why
cant
i
just
give
a
numerical
value
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
definitely
take
it
if
it
were
offered
to
me
kinda
creamy
malt
taste
then
big
bitter
lingering
finish
excellent
head
and
nutty
malty
dark
taste
wonderful
as
an
nighttime
beer

i
thought
it
a
bit
hoppy
for
my
taste
it
seemed
to
obscure
the
malt
flavors
a
bit
much
i
think
i
like
it
better
now
that
its
had
time
to
mellow
i
could
see
storing
some
of
this
in
the

for

overall
reminded
me
a
bit
like
a
longlost
equally
illegitimate
second
cousin
to
stones
arrogant
bastard
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
i
have
had
it
in
bottles
in
years
past
but
was
really
impressed
with
the
draft
offering
recommended
taste
is
full
and
sweet
with
caramel
flavors
balanced
with
a
nice
level
of
hop
spice
finishes
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
brown
sugar
and
lingers
a
bit
like
a
sweet
port
wine
pleasant
feel
and
carbonation
though
perhaps
a
bit
simple
in
the
malt
body
leading
to
a
singular
approach
through
the
palate
i
liked
this
it
didnt
necessarily
feel
like
a
winter
warmer
to
me
but
more
like
a
hoppy
american
amber
with
some
festive
feeling
spicing
added
to
it
or
at
least
a
really
hoppy
take
on
the
winter
warmer
style
at
any
rate
id
still
go
back
to
this
one
its
a
tasty
winter
seasonal
o
this
beer
definitely
surprised
me
less
spice
than
i
expected
also
didnt
catch
much
of
the
malt
that
was
advertised
thought
it
was
very
drinkable
and
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
malts
provide
a
sturdy
backbone
in
a
medium
body
light
carbonation
is
supportive
but
not
overdone
and
theres
a
good
transition
from
crisp
in
the
front
to
smoother
in
the
middle
and
into
a
pretty
dry
finish
o
actually
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
really
easy
drinkability
and
refreshing
dark
red
pour
with
a
spicy
hoppy
aroma
nice
head
on
this
pour
very
much
like
an
ipa
with
its
hops
foundation
with
some
spice
dont
ask
me
what
spice
its
just
spicy
thrown
in
not
too
bitter
but
the
amount
of
hops
caught
me
off
guard
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
pleasant
surprise
d
pretty
darn
drinkable
i
think
the
carbonation
helps
quite
a
bit
there
im
admittedly
not
a
big
winter
warmer
fan
but
this
is
quite
good
o
similar
to
an
ipa
but
with
an
extra
punch
a
good
dose
of
hop
but
the
spice
is
a
nice
touch
to
seperate
it
from
many
other
brews
a
fine
addition
the
the
widmer
bros
collection
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
light
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
some
herbal
and
citrus
zest
hops
taste
is
of
herbal
and
citrus
zest
hops
up
front
that
becomes
sweet
with
malt
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
that
sticks
to
the
tongue
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
that
is
quite
hoppy
for
the
style
overall
i
think
this
just
may
be
a
new
winter
favorite
i
really
appreciate
the
7
2
abv
as
i
think
winter
warmers
should
be
higher
in
alcohol
this
is
a
wonderfully
hoppy
and
warming
beer
for
the
winter
months
pick
some
up
you
wont
be
let
down
no
spice
flavors
to
speak
of
and
while
the
alcohol
is
on
the
high
side
youd
never
guess
its
weight
from
this
superbly
balanced
brew
winter
warmer
or
not
this
is
great
beer
all
in
all
a
good
beer
but
at
around
a
buck
a
bottle
a
great
value
the
waves
of
different
beer
flavors
all
in
one
makes
this
plenty
enjoyable
a
little
of
everything
for
the
winter
time
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
s
rich
hop
scent
slightness
of
sugars
o
i
enjoy
the
body
on
this
beer
and
the
tricky
taste
that
makes
me
believe
it
will
be
hoppy
but
switches
to
a
malty
finish
something
i
would
purchase
again
of
the
winter
seasonal
beers
ive
been
able
to
find
cant
find
celebration
for
the
life
of
me
this
one
is
fantastic
my
first
sampling
of
a
widmer
brothers
beer
this
was
definitely
a
good
place
to
start
its
a
shame
they
changed
the
packaging
it
is
all
rather
boring
now
and
just
looks
a
bit
too
generic
overall
i
would
rate
this
higher
because
its
so
cheap
and
its
very
different
from
the
genre
and
it
does
a
very
good
job
i
wish
this
was
bottled
in
bigger
bottles
than
just
12oz
having
to
pay
for
a
whole
six
pack
at
stores
outside
of
bottle
shops
is
annoying
and
when
you
shop
for
beers
after
they
close
this
is
passed
up
unfortunately
but
i
am
giving
it
a
4
because
its
really
good
hope
widmer
bottles
this
next
year
in
bigger
bottles
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
sam
adams
glass
decent
head
and
lacing
pours
a
deep
amber
wow
aroma
is
knock
your
socks
off
pine
and
citrus
hops
with
some
cotton
candy
taste
is
a
bitter
hoppy
profile
no
question
i
would
define
this
as
an
ipa
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
little
oversweet
on
the
malt
profile
but
maybe
thats
what
is
supposed
to
qualify
this
as
a
winter
warmer
nice
bitter
dry
finish
the
bold
hop
profile
was
unexpected
for
a
winter
warmer
although
im
not
sure
how
the
style
is
really
defined
not
bad
d
highly
drinkable
brew
a
bit
strong
to
hammer
back
the
whole
six
but
otherwise
highly
quaffable
this
is
a
tasty
winter
seasonal
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
solid
winter
warmer
that
is
one
of
the
things
i
love
about
beer
this
time
of
year
pours
a
dark
amber
color
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
rich
maltiness
to
it
its
flavors
are
warm
but
mild
not
too
distinctive
in
any
particular
notes
i
get
a
lot
of
hop
and
citrus
notes
for
some
reason
when
i
smell
and
get
some
of
those
flavors
towards
the
end
of
my
sip
its
medium
fullness
but
not
too
heavy
a
soapy
texture
lingers
on
my
palet
a
little
overall
its
a
nice
beer
to
drink
in
the
fall
or
being
of
winter
fairly
easy
to
drink
not
overly
robust
with
flavors
to
make
you
ponder
its
a
straight
forward
ale
and
i
think
i
like
it
never
quite
comes
together
this
is
not
how
i
like
my
winter
warmers
o
a
good
winter
warmer
has
the
spiciness
without
being
over
bearing
at
all
from
the
bottle
stamped

sampled

it
pours
a
kind
of
dark
amberolive
note
with
hues
of
red
and
a
shortlived
head
on
the
nose
the
aroma
favors
the
hops
with
a
pleasantly
mellow
caramel
malt
and
sugar
sweetness
the
body
is
better
than
medium
up
front
there
is
a
sweet
candied
malt
character
in
the
taste
but
it
does
not
last
long
because
a
definite
hop
bitterness
creeps
up
quickly
and
leaves
its
mark
nicely
done
really
tasty
heavily
hopped
winter
warmer
give
it
a
try
o
a
pretty
good
brew
not
as
much
depth
as
i
had
hope
but
it
is
overall
a
good
drinking
brew
would
get
it
again
this
has
turned
out
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
along
with
hibernation
and
isolation

o
this
one
is
great
i
think
what
make
this
beer
so
good
is
the
fine
line
of
not
overdoing
it
in
any
particular
area
hops
fruityflavor
pinespice
carbonation
and
last
but
not
least
alcohol
level
very
refreshing
and
will
get
again
and
goin
to
look
for
a
tap
asap
i
am
really
enjoying
the
seasonals
from
widmer
this
year
and
this
one
ranks
among
the
best
of
the
pnw
winter
warmers
complex
with
lots
of
malts
and
hops
which
blend
together
in
a
sort
of
fruitcakey
take
on
an
ipa
i
found
i
could
drink
it
like
a
regular
ale
or
sip
like
it
like
anold
ale
nuanced
yet
extremely
drinkable
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
red
hues
and
a
frothy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
lemon
and
pine
lots
of
citrus
with
a
toffee
sweet
caramel
base
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
it
tastes
of
citrus
hops
mainly
grapefruit
with
a
base
of
caramel
and
toasted
malt
very
candylike
this
is
a
heavy
beer
and
its
very
smooth
moderate
to
low
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
great
winter
seasonal
seems
like
its
stuck
between
a
winter
warmer
and
an
ipa
o
right
up
my
alley
this
beer
seems
like
a
toneddown
version
of
double
bastard
the
american
hops
and
higher
malt
profile
work
together
well
for
this
winter
warmer
taste
is
pretty
mild
but
caramel
and
spices
dominate
malty
aftertaste
easy
and
decent
seasonal
drink
definitely
the
best
choice
at
the
pub
i
was
at
the
flavor
seems
malty
at
first
but
with
a
clean
hops
finish
that
places
this
more
in
line
with
a
pale
ale
delicious
and
worthy
o
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
brew
from
these
guys
this
is
no
exception
an
excellent
winter
warmer
lots
of
body
and
good
depth
of
flavors
hops
and
spices
are
very
nice
brrr
falls
squarely
into
the
category
of
winter
warmer
i
like
best
american
hopforward
with
a
solid
malt
body
of
the
red
variety
most
importantly
no
spices
are
present
to
taint
it
hops
jump
out
first
with
candied
orange
peel
and
freshly
cut
pine
followed
by
the
shortbread
and
toffee
malt
side
digging
deeper
subtle
roast
comes
out
along
with
an
herbal
hop
component
finish
is
a
tad
sweeter
than
i
would
normally
like
my
hoppy
beers
but
it
fits
in
with
the
winter
warmer
theme
and
the
sheer
amount
of
hop
flavor
seems
to
balance
it
out
a
first
rate
nw
red
ale
o
overall
another
solid
candidate
in
the
winter
warmer
category
this
one
leans
slightly
more
towards
the
hops
than
some
of
the
others
out
there
making
it
a
good
choice
for
those
who
find
some
winter
warmers
too
malty
for
their
taste
a
really
solid
beer
and
very
enjoyable
d
surprising
offering
from
widmer
and
hoppier
than
expected
falls
somewhere
in
between
a
dark
ipa
and
american
red
winter
warmer
is
a
pretty
broad
category
so
im
sure
this
fits
in
there
somewhere
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
good
seasonal
beer
a
beer
that
i
wouldnt
choose
to
drink
over
other
choices
out
of
season
but
this
is
a
good
beer
to
celebrate
autumn
with
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
piney
hops
mixed
in
a
very
nice
aroma
overall
the
flavor
is
heavier
on
the
hops
than
i
expected
i
get
a
lot
of
pine
as
well
as
some
caramel
malt
low
bitterness
and
very
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
take
on
a
winter
warmer
o
decent
beer
far
from
my
favorite
winter
very
drinkable
for
a
7
beer
a
fairly
solid
brew
that
twists
in
a
darker
style
of
english
ipa
with
a
winter
warmer
attitude
d
i
was
surprised
by
this
usually
i
dont
have
very
high
expectations
of
widmer
beers
but
this
was
pretty
solid
mf
no
big
body
or
warming
expected
of
a
winter
warmer
but
it
is
an
easily
sessionable
ale
with
good
introductory
hop
character
d
this
was
a
nice
ww
had
a
crisp
hop
bite
with
spice
and
malt
one
of
the
better
tasting
ones
this
winter
d
pretty
drinkable
nice
take
on
the
winter
warmer
style
with
a
lot
of
hop
flavors
d
this
is
my
favorite
winter
beer
and
my
favorite
widmer
beer
i
always
look
forward
to
this
beer
coming
out
every
winter
i
was
surprised
to
experience
a
winter
warmer
that
tastes
more
like
a
traditional
american
ipa
for
an
ipa
it
was
very
traditional
very
citrus
and
piny
and
hopforward
just
didnt
expect
this
from
a
winter
beer
very
good
i
wish
this
was
available
all
year
round
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
of
all
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
little
bit
of
white
foamy
head
smells
of
citrusy
hops
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
a
perfect
balance
of
malt
and
citrus
hops
with
more
hop
flavor
than
malt
which
is
the
way
i
like
it
finishes
amazingly
smooth
with
no
harsh
aftertaste
d
best
widmer
product
ive
had
to
date
a
solid
winter
brew
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
widmer
a
brand
i
am
normally
not
fond
of
even
though
this
is
classified
as
a
winter
warmer
i
consider
it
more
of
an
ipa
and
would
buy
it
over
many
ipas
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
great
mouthfeel
and
smell
the
taste
it
too
bitter
for
a
winter
warmer
in
my
opinion
when
i
think
of
the
ideal
winter
warmer
i
want
crack
open
something
nice
with
a
complex
and
spicy
taste
full
bodied
and
goes
down
smooth
i
would
say
this
has
all
of
that
except
for
the
goes
down
smooth
part
it
is
too
bitter
for
my
regular
taste
not
a
bad
beer
probably
great
to
some
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
far
as
winter
warmers
are
concerned
i
consider
this
to
be
a
hoppy
beer
with
a
great
malt
base
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
lot
i
finished
it
faster
than
i
drink
most
of
my
beers
great
job
kurt
rob
d
for
a
winter
warmer
its
very
drinkable
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
winter
warmer
i
actually
drank
this
a
few
nights
ago
and
im
just
reviewing
my
notes
now
on
my
notes
i
thought
it
was
a
seasonal
ipa
thats
why
i
tried
it
my
bartender
did
not
tell
me
this
was
a
winter
warmer
if
i
had
known
that
i
wouldnt
have
tried
this
at
the
tail
end
of
my
session
thankfully
its
only
7
2
and
not
912
like
some
warmers
tend
to
be
overall
a
pretty
decent
experience
give
it
a
shot
if
you
get
a
chance
kind
of
strange
this
one
seems
like
more
of
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
than
a
winter
warmer
not
much
in
the
way
of
maltiness
or
spices
that
i
can
discern
tastes
ok
for
a
ipa
though
different
than
your
traditional
winter
warmer
id
recommend
it
if
youre
looking
to
try
something
new
drink
another
one
of
those
times
i
wish
a
bought
a
six
pack
and
not
a
single
d
for
me
this
is
one
of
the
best
winter
ales
out
there
so
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
such
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
drinkability
relatively
quaffable
for
the
abv
an
interesting
winter
warmer
somewhat
reminiscent
of
sn
celebration
ale
glad
i
bought
the
six
pack
but
will
pick
up
a
sn
celebration
ale
over
this
in
the
future
otherwise
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
just
not
a
taste
that
has
me
thinking
about
curling
up
next
to
a
fire
on
a
snowy
winters
night
drinkability
the
brew
has
an
overall
great
appeal
with
its
abundance
of
nicely
combined
flavors
the
slightly
high
abv
may
make
it
difficult
the
polish
off
a
sixer
however
many
will
try
and
few
will
win
good
drinkability
not
the
best
beer
out
there
but
a
good
one
da
pretty
tasty
winter
seasonal
not
for
the
hop
shy
enjoyed
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
with
very
little
carbonation
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
that
you
can
pound
down
fast
some
pretty
strong
flavors
in
this
one
overall
pretty
nicely
done
by
widmer
a
good
winter
beer
for
the
hop
lover
surprising
from
a
company
best
known
for
a
mediocre
wit
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
wasnt
expecting
that
from
widmer
had
a
nice
carmel
taste
and
a
nice
little
sweet
taste
as
well
but
definitely
not
too
sweet
had
a
nice
little
hop
taste
to
it
and
was
really
easy
to
drink
i
am
not
a
professional
reviewer
although
i
have
been
drinking
good
beers
for
at
least
10
years
now
so
i
know
a
little
i
know
a
good
beer
when
i
taste
it
and
this
one
passes
the
test
tasty
and
powerful
i
can
find
no
other
word
that
fits
as
well
as
appreciate
i
appreciate
this
brew
as
it
dances
across
my
pallet
as
it
dulls
my
emotional
senses
tops
off
my
dinner
this
particular
brew
1
tastes
great
2
costs
less
than
1
50bottle
and
3
is
truly
amber
placing
it
above
90
of
the
winter
brews
ive
experienced
drinkability
not
terribly
complex
but
a
goodtasting
brew
maybe
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
to
get
a
sixpack
of
but
good
for
bottle
or
two
the
body
was
very
light
for
the
stated
style
drinkability
was
very
good
although
not
for
the
style
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
thought
it
was
a
decent
ipa
not
what
it
claims
to
be
worth
trying
and
im
gonna
bust
open
my
22
of
brrbon
in
a
few
minutes
good
beer
fro
the
price
sixer
for
9
bones
i
could
have
plenty
of
these
and
it
is
one
my
favorite
seasonal
beers
this
is
honestly
more
of
a
red
or
imperial
red
to
me
very
superb
overall
pours
a
transparent
redbrown
color
with
an
off
white
or
light
tan
head
smells
roasty
with
some
citrus
tastes
of
caramel
malt
and
has
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
spice
mouthfeel
is
medium
it
has
very
light
carbonation
although
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
i
am
trying
to
learn
to
like
it
more
if
you
enjoy
a
good
winter
warmer
you
should
definitely
give
this
a
try
overall
slight
better
than
the
average
winter
beer
the
flavor
is
good
but
its
not
that
impressive
overall
a
nice

a
lovely
holiday
beer
very
well
balanced
and
straight
aimed
at
the
style
the
christmas

may
have
met
its
match
a
deep
but
clear
dark

brown
with
a
nice
offwhite
foamy
head
good
citrusy
hop
aroma
along
with
sweet
chewy
caramels
flavors
of
milk
chocolate
caramel
and
brown
sugar
this
one
goes
down
pretty
easily
for
the
7
abv
not
a
bad
christmas
gift
from
the
widmer
brothers
drinkability
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
piney
beers
i
have
encountered
not
bad
but
a
bit
too
much
in
that
direction
for
my
palate
normally
i
do
not
drink
alot
of
widmer
brothers
beer
but
i
am
in
love
with
all
kinds
of
winter
ales
so
i
had
to
stop
and
pick
up
a
pack
of
brr
the
moment
i
took
my
first
drink
there
was
a
flavor
explosion
in
my
mouth
and
it
didnt
fade
like
most
beers
but
it
hung
around
inside
my
mouth
giving
me
a
constant
taste
of
a
good
darker
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
one
of
my
favorite
store
bought
beers
big
mistake
this
beer
is
repulsive
to
the
taste
it
looks
good
smells
good
and
is
strong
at
over
7
alcohol
but
my
god
it
tastes
horrible
ive
never
had
it
with
a
meal
a
lemon
or
lime
but
it
disappoints
every
time
and
i
will
never
try
it
again
unless
im
already
drunk
brrr
assaults
the
taste
buds
with
puckering
grapefruit
and
lemon
notes
to
me
brrr
smacks
of
an
ipa
more
than
a
red
ale
and
i
dont
pick
up
any
of
the
malt
balance
other
reviews
mention
the
beer
has
the
mouthfeel
of
a
7
beer
with
a
nice
alcohol
zip
on
the
tongue
and
body
is
appropriate
for
the
style
while
brrr
is
tasty
and
not
too
hard
to
drink
id
welcome
a
little
more
complexity
of
flavor
d
a
decent
beer
that
hides
the
alcohol
rather
well
the
mouthfeel
is
good
the
beer
is
definitely
warming
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
shocked
when
i
saw
that
this
beer
had
a
7
2
abv
the
good
thing
about
winter
warmers
is
that
the
spiciness
hides
the
alcohol
the
bad
thing
about
winter
warmers
is
that
they
can
be
so
damn
spicy
when
they
get
it
right
they
can
be
great
and
the
widmer
brrr
is
pretty
damn
good
it
seems
a
year
in
the
cellar
has
done
this
beer
pretty
well
a
nice
slight
oxidized
maltiness
comes
through
and
really
helps
smooth
the
beer
out
i
did
not
like
this
one
very
much
when
fresh
but
it
tastes
pretty
good
now
fairly
basic
but
decent
winter
seasonal
overall
this
is
more
like
an
extra
apa
i
havent
had
torpedo
in
a
while
but
this
is
eerily
similar
to
me
great
beer
but
a
winter
warmer
just
as
much
a
winter
warmer
as
sn
celebration
is
i
suppose
although
they
dont
claim
it
as
such
the
beer
drinks
surprisingly
smooth
for
a
winter
offering
yet
there
is
no
sacrifice
to
flavor
your
gut
will
think
youve
had
a
light
beer
while
youre
mouth
will
think
you
just
had
a
thick
amber
d
again
surprisingly
good
and
exceeded
my
expectations
would
actually
buy
a
sixer
of
this
had
received
just
one
12
oz
bottle
as
part
of
a
gift
set
13
finger
white
head
over
reddish
clear
copper
amber
body
nose
features
bready
malts
and
a
big
spicy
hop
hit
taste
is
a
pretty
big
hop
presence
for
ww
more
spicy
than
citrusy
but
no
noticeable
spices
pretty
well
balanced
especially
on
the
back
end
when
sweetish
malts
come
through
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
average
carbonation
a
bit
sticky
from
the
malts
not
too
heavy
damn
drinkable
one
of
the
better
widmer
brews
pretty
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
worth
checking
out
the
mouthfeel
is
mildly
creamy
with
mildmedium
carbonation

thanks
gary
drinkability
amazingly
smooth
and
delicious
for
a
beer
that
is
over
7
alcohol
this
is
the
best
widmer
beer
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
i
could
happily
drink
this
again
were
it
on
at
my
local
on
a
night
when
i
was
hanging
out
for
a
while
id
happily
session
it
though
the
abv
is
a
little
high
for
that
all
4s
tastes
like
a
nice
pale
ale
not
like
what
a
winter
warmer
should
be
like
in
my
opinion
but
still
a
great
beer
good
brrr
def
one
of
my
favs
this
is
one
of
widmer
brothers
better
brews
like
this
better
than
their
year
round
ipa
great
value
at
5
99
a
sixer
on
sale
i
am
absolutly
dissatisfied
with
the
changes
although
it
is
still
not
a
terrible
beer
it
is
not
even
the
same
beer
it
is
nothing
like
it
was
before
and
i
cant
understand
how
they
even
thought
it
would
be
ok
to
brew
it
under
the
same
name
if
it
is
not
the
same
beer
i
looked
forward
to
this
thing
all
summer
and
now
its
finally
here
what
a
let
down
i
ordered
one
more
just
to
make
sure
it
was
the
right
one
or
maybe
a
bad
pour
i
even
bought
a
6
pack
on
my
way
home
to
make
sure
but
nope
its
been
changed
poured
a
medium
and
hazy
amber
color
with
a
smaller
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
floral
hops
pine
and
some
caramel
tastes
of
the
same
floral
hops
pine
and
caramel
this
was
definitely
on
the
hoppier
side
which
is
fine
for
me
if
i
had
known
how
delicious
brrr
is
i
would
have
purchased
more
than
this
single
bottle
and
would
have
cracked
the
cap
long
before
today
another
plus
is
that
it
looks
like
each
years
release
will
last
until
the
following
years
release
heres
hoping
the
brewery
keeps
this
one
around
for
many
a
winter
to
come

nice

the
name
of
this

should
be
kind
of
funny
to
fans
of
old
helloween
who
really
know
their
triviai
know
youre
out
there
otherwise
its
just
a
cool
nameno
pun
intended
d
overall
not
a
bad
beer
the
high
abv
can
get
to
you
but
this
is
after
all
a
holiday
beer
its
too
heavy
or
overwhelming
a
nice
offering
from
widmer
beer
pours
an
amber
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
is
leaving
lacing
behind
nose
was
intense
hops
initially
with
malts
now
dominating
taste
is
caramel
malts
that
balance
nicely
with
piney
and
grapefruit
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
as
the
abv
is
very
well
masked
my
bro
and
i
first
sampled
this
tailgaiting
at
a
december
cardinals
game
and
we
were
both
surprised
at
how
good
it
was
this
will
definitely
be
worked
into
the
winter
seasonal
rotation
recomended
to
fans
of
hoppy
red
ales
drinkability
is
good
this
one
turned
out
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
not
sure
if
this
is
really
a
winter
warmer
this
strikes
me
as
being
more
like
a
hoppy
amber
ale
or
an
ipa
whatever
it
is
doesnt
really
matter
much
to
me
i
think
its
just
a
nice
tasty
offering
from
widmer
this
beer
would
make
a
nice
accessory
on
a
frigid
night
however
its
not
geared
for
copious
consumption
im
fine
with
just
one
no
complaints

thanks
brian
d
average
the
flavor
cools
down
quite
a
bit
as
this
one
warms
but
a
decent
beer
i
suppose
this
beer
pours
a
murky
swamp
water
brown
the
head
is
half
and
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
pine
resin
with
hints
of
caramel
underneath
the
taste
is
of
like
the
aroma
hoppy
yet
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
a
lot
hoppier
that
i
expected
but
it
is
good
nonetheless
i
could
drink
this
again
decent
but
i
dont
really
dig
the
spices
very
much
not

favorite

lasts
almost
entire
beer
clear
ruby
brown
color
lots
of
hops
cherries
and
cloves
in
the
aroma
starts
a
bit
astringent
nutty
hints
of
clove
and
nutmeg
finish
is
quite
hoppy
dry
and
bitter
aftertaste
is
warm
and
bittersweet
medium
body
alcohol
moderate
widmer
now
has
two
beers
that
i
like
grab
this
one
and
big
eddy
if
you
can
find
it
definitely
something
i
could
and
will
drink
many
of
this
is
a
very
good
amber
beer
with
a
solid
hop
profile
that
keeps
things
pretty
interesting
tasty
final
note
this
is
listed
as
a
winter
warmer
but
i
based
my
review
on
how
it
tasted
and
i
never
tasted
a
winter
warmer
quite
like
this
brrr
starts
off
sweet
boozy
and
spicy
with
a
resin
hop
presence
that
hints
at
citrus
notes
the
bitter
hop
assertiveness
picks
up
midsip
and
rides
out
for
a
lengthy
finish
but
eventually
fades
as
a
metallic
offflavor
sets
in
during
the
aftertaste
body
is
a
bit
on
the
thinwatery
side
for
a
7
2
winter
warmer
and
the
carbonation
is
almost
flat
but
otherwise
the
mouthfeel
is
good
easily
a
winter
warmer
that
id
purchase
again
and
even
though
it
drinks
more
like
an
ipa
widmer
brothers
has
a
seasonal
to
be
proud
of
with
this
entry
drinkability
greatly
impressed
by
this
widmer
effort
im
usually
turned
of
by
the
flagship
line
but
their
seasonal
line
usually
does
good
for
me
like
a
combo
of
celebration
and
osa
well
melded
medium
body
and
very
smooth
this
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
i
wish
it
would
be
around
another
couple
of
months
because
this
sixer
will
go
quickly
and
i
fear
there
may
be
no
more
brrr
when
i
return
to
surdyks
for
my
next
run
overall
a
great
value
and
a
great
tasting
beer
a
very
good
beer
but
one
that
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
i
expect
a
beer
in
this
category
to
have
warming
spice
and
dark
malts
while
this
isnt
sub
par
by
any
means
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
winter
warmer
as
well
as
it
does
ipa
the
finish
is
not
very
exciting
but
not
bad
the
drinkability
sum
of
the
parts
is
a
little
higher
than
the
various
components
would
suggest
on
their
own
it
is
keeping
me
warm
during
the
cold
so
at
least
it
has
that
thing
going
for
it
this
is
a
really
nice
winter
beer
the
appearance
is
a
nice
clear
amber
color
the
spices
are
pleasing
to
the
nose
the
beer
is
really
well
balanced
between
hops
spices
and
malt
flavors
you
can
definitely
taste
each
one
but
none
of
them
are
overpowering
they
rather
compliment
each
other
definitely
a
complex
beer
to
be
savored
rather
than
chugged
very
good
winter
ale
exactly
what
i
wanted
hoppy
and
barleyey
and
not
too
expensive
either
overall
i
like
this
beer
very
much
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
backbone
to
balance
out
the
hops
there
a
nice
earthiness
to
the
beer
that
brings
down
to
earth
no
pun
intended
the
mouth
feel
is
astringent
and
warming
the
finish
is
bitter
and
it
linger
for
a
few
moments
on
the
palate
it
is
a
nice
winter
warmer
12
oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
transparent
copper
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
that
remains
in
a
wispy
ghost
surrounding
the
edges
of
the
glass
aroma
is
of
pine
lemon
tropical
fruits
which
is
bordering
on
catty
simcoe
summit
hops
flavor
is
sweet
and
hoppy
a
kind
of
citric
twang
in
a
good
way
and
a
mild
malt
presence
trying
to
catch
up
with
the
barrage
of
citrus
lemon
fruitiness
finish
is
warmingly
bitter
and
coats
the
tongue
with
ripe
hops
overall
a
nice
beer
but
for
me
its
perhaps
a
bit
too
catty
on
the
nose
and
in
the
flavor
but
i
think
i
may
be
quite
sensitive
in
that
realm
tasty
cheers
and
hoppy
holidays
on
a
side
note
this
could
be
the
dumbest
name
ive
seen
on
a
beer
d
felt
more
like
a
strong
apa
than
a
winter
warmer
to
me
but
then
this
is
a
very
broad
beer
style
certainly
enjoyable
enough
a
very
nice
beer
medium
bodied
sweet
but
hoppy
winter
warmer
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
6
of
these
easily
which
i
did
my
favorite
from
widmer
drinkability
is
ok
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
really
doesnt
work
for
me
id
like
more
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
more
or
a
different
hop
flavor
also
not
loving
the
plastic
phenolics
but
they
abv
is
well
hidden
d
good
balance
very
tasty
with
good
hop
character
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
winter
warmers
ive
ever
had
it
certainly
is
one
of
the
hoppiest
it
somewhat
works
and
is
technically
well
done
its
just
what
theyve
achieved
here
is
just
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
ok
for
some
reason
i
decided
to
try
this
good
choice
nice
orange
color
looks
like
sn
celebration
smells
and
tastes
piney
caramel
a
hoppy
beer
but
might
as
well
be
an
ipa
i
like
the
idea
of
hoppy
redsipas
during
the
winter
warming
tasty
with
a
bit
of
the
caramel
spice
go
buy
brrr
ob
gordon
celebration
decorate
your
tree
id
call
this
an
amber
ale
and
a
good
one
damn
glad
i
bought
this
this
is
listed
as
a
winter
warmer
but
obviously
should
be
reviewed
along
the
lines
of
an
ipa
or
highly
hopped
red
ale
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
and
would
recommend
it
highly
im
not
sure
if
i
would
get
this
again
as
i
would
probably
get
a
celebration
instead
this
is
much
better
than
snowplow
im
a
big
fan
of
hops
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
one
inch
of
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
surface
strong
aroma
of
hops
citrus
and
pine
dominate
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
more
balanced
as
the
malt
adds
a
little
sweetness
to
the
bitter
hops
still
finishes
bitter
though
the
body
is
quite
nice
with
a
semi
creamy
texture
but
it
feels
a
little
thin
for
something
trying
to
carry
the
abv
and
the
hops
if
you
like
hopped
up
red
ales
like
i
do
then
this
beer
will
be
appealing
knocked
the
drinkability
down
a
little
because
of
the
high
abv
glad
to
see
other
reviewers
get
this
beer
because
ive
heard
comments
from
people
about
how
its
too
hoppy
too
thin
too
something
to
be
a
good
winter
seasonal
plus
i
guess
people
miss
snowplow
widmers
terrific
previous
winter
seasonal
and
apparently
widmer
realized
that
and
brought
it
back
out
in
addition
to
brrr
well
brrr
is
a
great
beer
whether
or
not
it
is
appropriate
as
a
winter
seasonal
and
it
does
taste
good
in
the
winter
makes
a
great
christmas
gift
and
yes
i
wouldnt
mind
if
theyd
keep
making
it
yearround
so
if
youre
looking
for
a
barleywine
or
a
spiced
beer
this
isnt
it
but
if
you
want
to
try
a
wellhopped
wellbalanced
big
but
not
huge
red
ale
give
it
a
try
didnt
know
what
to
expect
after
being
grossed
out
by
punkin
beer
cinnamon
beer
coriander
beer
and
what
have
you
i
was
afraid
id
find
another
precious
seasonal
so
i
held
my
breath
and
started
knocking
this
down
oowee
man
it
reminds
me
of
the
spruce
gum
the
relatives
used
to
send
us
from
nova
scotia
the
label
says
it
winds
up
with
a
candy
aftertaste
but
the
spruce
gum
drove
that
right
away
then
after
i
recovered
from
what
happened
i
said
man
what
happened
i
gotta
down
another
swig
and
figure
this
out
its
like
dmt
for
the
timid
go
get
this
stuff
if
you
are
ready
for
repeated
trips
to
the
far
borders
of
beer
taste
but
want
to
come
back
for
a
rest
cheers
drinkability
would
definitely
have
another
and
can
look
to
trying
this
again
next
year
a
shame
this
is
only
a
seasonal
can
see
widmer
making
this
a
year
round
beer
with
the
great
response
this
beer
gets
at
the
pubs
and
the
stores
d
very
drinkable
beer
not
too
bitter
and
not
overly
carbonated
can
have
several
in
one
night
nice
overall
a
bit
cloudy
head
is
ok
has
a
nice
lace
however
very
hoppy
smell
strong
floral
scent
somewhat
bitter
in
taste
not
too
bad
though
mouthfeel
enhances
the
presence
of
hopps
and
bitterness
which
is
definatly
an
acquired
taste
id
definatly
drink
this
beer
again
this
was
interesting
orange
copper
color
in
my
pint
glass
the
beer
was
leaving
good
initial
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
the
aroma
was
quite
good
hops
dry
malt
bready
a
bit
of
orange
as
for
the
taste
it
had
potential
here
it
certainly
was
strong
tasting
but
lacked
depth
strong
piney
hops
with
some
caramel
to
balance
here
so
far
so
good
but
within
a
quarter
of
the
way
it
was
all
bitter
hops
and
no
malt
to
be
tasted
i
can
enjoy
a
strong
hoppy
beer
even
unbalanced
ones
but
this
one
needs
to
be
tweeked
to
be
enjoyable
i
also
love
the
fact
that
widmer
stamps
a
bottled
on
date
on
the
bottle
as
well
as
the
label
the
taste
is
much
richer
and
more
complex
its
very
hoppy
in
flavour
with
citrus
grapefruit
and
orange
zest
but
caramellysweet
fruit
toasted
grain
with
a
dry
leafy
hint
in
the
finish
it
is
actually
rather
sweet
with
some
spicey
warmth
and
a
litght
bitterness
that
is
more
prominent
in
the
aftertaste
its
fullbodied
smooth
slightly
oily
yet
zesty
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
pours
a
nice
redamber
color
with
good
head
retention
the
aroma
gives
off
hints
of
citrus
and
pine
flavor
is
spicy
with
a
hoppy
finish
almost
no
malt
flavors
in
my
opinion
not
exaclt
a
winter
ale
in
my
opinion
but
closer
to
an
apa
a
little
bitter
for
my
tastes
but
very
drinkable
not
bad
the
aroma
was
candy
sweet
and
full
of
malty
goodness
a
little
bit
of
hopiness
in
the
back
end
of
the
nose
the
taste
was
really
spicy
just
about
all
the
way
through
there
was
some
sweetness
at
the
finish
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
from
widmer
besides
the
hefe
i
have
thought
most
of
their
offering
although
stoic
have
been
middle
of
the
road
this
was
definitely
solid
and
worth
the
price
of
admission
this
is
a
nice
surprise
from
widmer
d
this
one
should
be
a
regular
and
not
seasonal
hop
character
is
nice
and
overall
a
tasty
brew
this
doesnt
have
what
i
look
for
usually
in
a
winter
warmer
but
it
does
have
plenty
of
the
things
i
like
in
a
beer
good
job
widmer
very
drinkable
winter
warmeri
cant
believe
i
have
passed
by
this
in
the
past
very
drinkable
mighta
given
it
a
better
rating
but
its
a
tad
nontraditional
nevertheless
a
fine
product
indeed
nice
hoppy
nose
not
so
much
malt
more
similar
to
a
pale
ale
in
style
hazy
amber
color
highlighted
with
orange
and
red
flavor
is
great
grapefruit
is
strong
but
not
persistant
some
earthy
characteristics
a
session
beer
for
sure
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
ipa
and
a
bit
light
on
the
winter
warming
they
are
onto
a
good
thing
here
and
amybe
just
a
slight
tweak
or
two
would
lean
this
one
a
tad
more
to
the
spicy
malt
side
to
make
it
a
hell
of
a
good
seasonal
winter
warmer
drinkability
due
to
the
inconsistency
this
one
gets
some
points
knocked
off
if
its
the
former
of
the
bottles
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
and
is
an
easy
purchase
unfortunately
ive
run
into
this
with
2
separate
6packs
so
i
likely
will
not
be
buying
it
again
which
is
a
shame
ive
enjoyed
this
both
in
the
bottle
and
on
tap
but
tap
wins
not
the
most
drinkable
winter
ale
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
again
if
as
rumored
it
is
really
the
replacement
for
snowplow
milk
stout
it
is
a
poor
replacement
i
cant
really
tell
any
difference
between
this
and
widmers
broken
halo
which
i
generally
like
more
malt
would
go
a
long
way
to
differentiating
the
too
if
theyre
willing
to
tweak
the
recipe
d
a
nice
one
from
widmer
dont
go
in
expecting
a
spicy
malty
christmas
beer
you
wont
get
it
this
is
more
along
the
lines
of
the
sierra
nevada
celebration
type
of
this
style
d
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
but
my
palate
was
pretty
wrecked
after
a
couple
of
them
did
i
mention
its
hoppy
tasty
but
kinda
onedimensional
for
a
winter
warmer
taste
is
of
caramel
some
malts
slightly
metallic
touch
of
spice
some
pine
and
ends
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
overall
impression
this
appears
to
be
a
direct
response
to
celebration
as
a
seasonal
that
being
said
its
great
to
see
some
variety
in
the
winter
beer
market
and
this
is
a
nice
offering
d
not
to
bad
but
not
really
a
winter
seasonal
imho
not
the
idea
i
had
of
the
winter
warmer
but
still
a
pretty
well
balanced
ipa
taste
mouthfeel
yep
an
ipa
it
is
a
pretty
damn
decent
one
too
resiny
floral
hops
up
front
with
a
pleasantly
dry
and
biscuity
malt
backbone
theres
a
bit
of
citrusy
orange
flavor
in
there
too
leading
into
a
finish
thats
got
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
winter
warmer
nah
this
is
just
an
american
ipa
im
pleasantly
surprised
though
edit

one
i
buy
every
year
along
with
sierra
nevada
celebration
kind
of
a
hoppy
red
ale
very
nice
winter
warmer
the
7
2
abv
is
well
hidden
so
watch
out
a
prost
to
widmer
brrr
da
highly
drinkable
beer
this
one
is
very
flavorful
and
was
my
pleasure
to
drink
it
down
a
fine
offering
from
pyramid
a
brewery
i
honestly
dont
seek
out
or
drink
alot
of
nice
work
ill
be
buying
another
sixer
of
this
before
the
hops
go
away
overall
this
tastes
a
lot
like
an
ipa
but
with
spices
added
very
great
beer
from
widmer
and
id
recommend
it
to
anybody
for
the
price
poured
this
darker
amber
colored
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
foam
was
just
about
two
fingers
and
reduced
to
a
steady
covering
over
the
beer
the
smell
of
pine
and
citrus
greet
your
nose
while
the
first
taste
is
a
hoppy
caramel
flavoring
with
hints
of
citrus
and
pines
however
the
aftertaste
of
a
toffee
comes
forth
nice
appearence
to
this
brew
slight
redddish
tint
a
lot
lighter
than
the
english
winter
warmers
with
tight
robust
head
on
top
nose
is
sweet
with
some
spices
coming
through
lots
of
grapefruit
coming
through
up
front
with
a
smooth
finish
i
like
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
of
this
product
as
it
made
me
want
to
have
another
first
of
all
this
is
not
a
winter
warmer
its
a
hopped
up
amber
ale
smells
great
pine
and
citrus
with
a
nice
sweet
caramel
aroma
in
the
back
flavour
is
at
first
hoppy
with
nice
pnw
hops
showcased
the
hops
give
way
to
a
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
flavour
that
rides
on
mild
biscuit
malts
the
finish
is
smoothly
bitter
with
a
touch
of
toffee
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
hope
the
widmers
send
more
of
their
beers
my
way
d
it
was
a
warming
and
well
balanced
brew
that
makes
a
fine
session
beer
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
not
bad
at
all
something
to
try
once
and
if
there
is
nothing
else
good
to
be
had
a
worthwhile
purchase
worth
trying
again
in
future
years
to
come
citrus
hop
aroma
with
an
odd
spicy
aroma
that
i
couldnt
really
place
kind
of
like
spruce
but
not
really
some
toasted
malt
flavor
much
like
a
brown
ale
surprisngly
well
hopped
for
widmer
long
lasting
bitterness
on
the
palate
i
wouldnt
get
a
second
one
drinkability
not
that
high
for
me
for
some
reason
i
lean
toward
a
malty
beer
as
a
winter
warmer
this
tries
too
hard
to
be
an
ipa
and
doesnt
pull
it
off
on
to
try
more
winter
warmers
this
season
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
there
are
many
better
winter
warmers
out
there
to
choose
this
over
them
an
interesting
beer
but
i
just
wasnt
loving
it
today
probably
wont
get
this
one
again
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
orange
color
with
a
small
amount
of
bone
white
foam
leaving
behind
some
lacing
kind
of
light
colored
for
a
winter
warmer
perhaps
strangely
im
picking
up
a
odor
of
pine
scented
air
freshner
maybe
from
copious
amounts
of
hops
interesting
also
some
nice
bready
aromas
very
nice
hop
flavor
on
this
one
i
was
fairly
surprised
nice
hop
bitterness
backed
up
by
some
toasty
bready
malts
some
spiciness
slightly
sweet
dry
on
the
finish
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
carbonation
bite
at
the
end
although
this
comes
in
at
7
2
abv
its
quite
drinkable
and
has
a
certain
ipa
quality
to
it
very
nice
and
pleasantly
surprised
although
its
not
what
i
usually
expect
out
of
a
winter
warmer
easily
the
best
widmer
brew
ive
had
to
date
ps
i
cant
stand
the
name
of
this
beer
yeah
thats
finicky
of
me
but
it
gives
me
shivers
pun
intended
really
body
is
actually
a
little
thin
for
a
winter
warmer
of
this
strength
but
doesnt
seem
out
of
place
given
the
flavors
while
not
the
most
exciting
offering
this
holiday
season
this
is
a
decent
warmer
that
is
more
than
adequate
for
an
evening
by
the
fireplace
appearance
has
a
light
brown
amber
with
a
thin
head
but
good
lace
smell
of
bold
hops
pine
and
citrus
taste
has
a
good
upfront
piney
hoppiness
grapefruit
spice
and
malt
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slick
going
down
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
though
the
abv
is
not
evident
in
taste
it
is
a
bold
drinker
one
that
the
palate
warms
up
to
wow
widmer
you
guys
really
surprised
me
with
this
one
d
wow
a
nice
drink
that
hides
its
high
abv
incredibly
well
i
started
out
this
review
horribly
biased
since
brrr
replaced
my
winter
standby
snowplow
that
being
said
im
impressed
its
not
really
a
winter
warmer
which
irks
me
a
bit
because
its
a
pretty
solid
red
and
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
in
the
late
summer
myself
seems
like
an
improvement
over
the
w06
which
this
is
supposedly
based
off
of
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
and
i
know
ill
be
drinking
a
few
more
packs
before
the
winters
over
even
though
i
still
kind
of
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
winter
warmerish
drinks
very
easy
despite
the
abv
hoppyness
widmer
you
are
on
to
a
winner
here
keep
this
one
in
the
lineup
drinkability
tasty
and
different
i
would
get
it
again
i
cant
help
beig
a
hop
head
strong
carbonation
provides
some
body
but
the
mouth
feel
is
just
bit
thin
if
anything
otherwise
very
drinkable
and
not
the
least
bit
boozy
from
the
relatively
high
abv
my
samples
were
enjoyable
and
somewhat
reminiscent
of
another
cold
weather
favorite
of
mine
schlafly
christmas
ale
particularly
in
the
aggressive
hop
profile
kudos
to
kurt
and
rob
widmer
on
what
should
be
a
welcome
addition
to
the
craft
winter
seasonals
lineup
for
winter
08
this
is
a
wonderful
hoppy
red
ale
from
widmer
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
them
nice
caramel
sweetness
with
hints
of
toasted
malt
the
hop
flavor
and
aroma
really
make
this
beer
special
if
youre
a
hop
head
give
this
one
a
try
nicely
done
widmer
bros
nice
beer
pretty
similar
to
the
w06
maybe
a
bit
spicier
though
pic
added
ummm
well
a
winter
seasonal
ale
that
makes
a
pretty
darn
good
hoppy
pale
ale
unless
thats
what
i
ended
up
with
bottled
with
the
wrong
label
2011
was
decent
especially
as
it
warmed
disappointing
i
was
truly
excited
smelled
magnificent
taste
only
soso
nice
abv
all
i
can
say
nice
effort
from
the
folks
at
widmer
maybe
too
simple
or
sweet
for
some
but
i
really
enjoyed

a

offering
this
is
one
of
the
few
times
im
going
to
agree
with
the
rating
as
spot
on
about
an
80
overall
score
for
this
one
ive
had
my
fair
share
of
bourbon
aged
beers
and
this
falls
short
in
so
many
ways
first
of
all
its
not
a
stout
so
dont
expect
one
it
pour
s
a
medium
transparent
brown
color
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
liquid
nor
head
on
top
sweet
bouquet
where
i
pick
up
some
notes
of
oats
and
barley
the
initial
sip
is
watery
doesnt
seem
like
a
9
abv
beer
not
much
flavor
lingers
on
the
tounge
and
almost
no
taste
of
bourbon
all
hype
and
no
deliver
too
much
bark
and
not
enough
bite
for
this
beer
seems
like
i
paid
13
simply
for
the
wax
they
put
on
the
top
of
the
bottle
high
c
i
have
to
say
the
11
was
the
hit
of
the
tasting
and
the
creamy
mouthfeel
with
the
big
body
and
killer
finish
made
for
a
great
sipper
oddidnt
love
the
feel
all
too
much
but
aside
from
that
it
could
be
worse
bourbon
seems
to
disagree
with
the
other
flavors
the
sturdy
malt
backbone
in
this
mediumbodied
beer
seems
to
have
been
thinned
slightly
by
alcohol
carbonation
is
still
light
but
enough
to
support
but
the
transition
from
crisp
in
the
front
to
smoother
in
the
middle
isnt
as
good
the
finish
does
remain
dry
not
as
bourbon
as
last
year
a
touch
diacetylbuttery
but
that
is
interesting
note
with
oak
a
bit
more
co2
or
hops
or
hot
alcohol
might
add
a
needed
counterpoint
its
all
bourbon
and
oak
and
limited
bubbles
a
darn
good
beer
a
bit
south
of
great
atmosphere
is
okay
no
real
head
or
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
boozy
light
flavor
in
general
except
for
some
bitterness
and
booze
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
overall
not
bad
nothing
too
special
but
decent
overall
nice
bourbon
characters
although
not
great
nice
barrel
characers
decent
malts
and
hops
hint
of
baking
spices
booze
is
just
enough
to
bring
some
character
without
being
too
much
i
would
try
it
again
if
handed
to
me
but
i
see
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
as
an
experience
and
there
are
far
better
experiences
out
there
o
pretty
good
bourbony
which
is
nice
but
its
smooth
and
i
think
that
at
its
price
point
its
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
not
bad
just
dull
no
real
barrel
character
to
it
a
thicker
body
and
more
age
might
do
this
some
good
nice
aroma
and
flavor
from
bourbon
barrels
but
light
on
the
beer
part
makes
this
a
thin
watery
bourbon
flavored
beverage
surprised
at
some
of
the
lower
scores
on
this
one
maybe
the
aging
helped
this
one
immensely
but
i
can
definitely
say
this
was
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
kicking
myself
for
not
having
cellared
several
more
bottles
of
this
im
taken
back
to
my
days
of
a
bourbon
aficionado
when
i
drank
too
much
whisky
and
coke
this
beer
tastes
as
close
to
whisky
and
coke
as
i
could
possible
imagine
i
love
whisky
and
coke
never
saw
this
coming
how
did
they
do
it
a
whole
new
category
of
beer
try
it
at
least
for
the
sake
of
sampling
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
overall
a
fine
sipper
for
the
last
few
weeks
of
winter
13
it
aged
nicely
overall
call
me
unimpressed
truly
tastes
like
bourbon
thats
been
cut
with
water
thats
it
really
nothing
else
to
it
definitely
a
beer
that
wont
be
on
my
future
want
list
taste
is
rich
and
sweetly
malty
but
i
dont
get
much
of
the
vanillalike
bourbon
tones
the
finish
does
showcase
the
warm
whiskey
character
though
comparable
to
alltech
brewings
bourbon
barrel
ale
this
ones
not
bad
though
perhaps
a
tad
high
on
the
price
14
99bomber
o
not
bad
but
disappointing
for
a
bourbon
aged
o
very
nice
smooth
beer
for
a
winter
warmer
its
a
very
nice
offering
i
drank
the
whole
thing
myself
over
a
few
hours
a
fairly
nice
accompaniment
for
a
cold
night
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter

vintage
offwhite

moderate

on
a
slightly
hazy
copper
body

and
soapy
sticky
lacing
aroma
includes
suprisingly
earthy
piney
hops
with
some
citrus
slight
vanilla
caramel
malts
and
marmalade
taste
is
again
dominated
by
earthy
hops
and
bitterness
some
caramel
malts
again
and
vanilla
sweetness
not
at
all
what
i
expected
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
quite
tasty
pours
a
reddish
orangey
brown
color
looks
like
your
typical
ale
a
good
amount
of
lacing
boils
up
and
subsides
after
a
moment
fairly
sticky
lacing
rings
the
glass
a
deep
whiff
earns
me
the
scent
of
apples
but
is
a
bit
muted
i
wonder
what
else
is
in
there
a
quaff
reveals
the
flavor
of
apples
toffee
dark
fruits
malts
vanilla
and
cream
a
little
smokey
overall
an
enjoyable
arrangement
of
flavors
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
light
and
the
flavor
radiates
well
i
wouldnt
mind
revisiting
this
one
in
the
future
o
quite
disappointed
was
expecting
much
better
especially
for
the
price
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
wood
and
slight
bourbon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
alcohol
kick
and
a
woody
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
a
decent
example
of
barrel
aging
overall
reading
through
the
reviews
i
wonder
whether
the
recipe
may
have
changed
here
as
i
found
this
beer
to
be
extremely
wellbalanced
with
a
very
deft
handling
of
the
bourbon
in
a
way
that
really
complements
the
base
beer
o
a
good
brew
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
overall
i
really
like
this
i
like
this
alternate
version
of
the
previous
brrr
i
tasted
and
the
bourbon
barrel
flavor
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
hops
and
pine
this
really
is
a
great
brew
however
i
am
not
sure
we
are
all
reviwing
the
same
beer
are
we
my
bottle
says
12
and
yet
the
reviews
go
all
the
way
back
to
2010
this
appears
to
be
an
annual
product
and
i
noticed
there
was
an
11
version
also
the
brewerys
website
even
advertises
the
11
but
not
the
12
confusion
but
who
cares
darn
fine
product
in
my
hands
and
since
i
still
dont
know
if
aliens
exist
i
suppose
i
can
live
without
knowing
whether
this
review
should
be
for
a
12
but
i
gave
the
taste
part
a
5
this
is
an
awesome
job
of
producing
beer

even
two
finger
off

bourbon
caramel

hints

aroma
hides

the
thick

ad
is
mostly
of

orange

caramel
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
a
little
oily
on
the
palate
a
lot
of
flavors
in
this
one
but
for
me
they
do
tall
come
together
in
the
end
to
form
a
memorable
or
great
beer
o
this
i
a
nice
beer
for
a
cold
night
very
nice
notes
from
the
barrels
though
they
are
not
wet
burbon
notes
wich
aloes
tem
to
just
add
some
nice
barrel
flavors
to
a
tasty
malt
backbone
nice
overall
a
beastly
beer
i
am
not
crazy
to
begin
with
on
the
bourbon
or
oaked
aged
beers
but
this
one
is
a
gem
i
know
there
are
different
versions
that
might
not
live
up
to
the
expectations
of
this
one
aged
two
years
just
right
did
it
for
me
i
have
had
this
bottle
for
about
a
year
and
thought
it
was
time
enjoy
and
drink
up
salud
its
not
hot
like
a
bourbon
but
if
you
dont
like
bourbon
or
whiskey
you
probably
wont
like
this
but
i
highly
recommend
it
as
one
of
my
favorites
from
widmer
where
i
think
the
sxnw
and
the
pitch
black
and
the
falconer
ipa
are
spectacular
overall
this
is
good
fare
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
the
beer
comes
across
well
at
first
but
the
bourbon
notes
even
though
theyre
somewhat
watery
tend
to
dominate
later
mouthfuls
and
the
beer
wants
for
a
better
malt
base
to
help
sustain
the
fruit
and
sugar
notes
theres
also
a
slightlytoolarge
remnant
of
whiskeylike
alcohol
about
the
edges
and
even
more
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
the
malts
not
quite
capable
of
hiding
the
higher
abv
the
ultimate
effect
is
that
despite
the
high
abv
this
comes
across
as
a
midgrade
ale
that
was
barrel
aged
for
better
flavor
d
very
drinkable
nice
barrel
character
balanced
nicely
by
the
big
winter
warmer
the
look
is
a
light
brown
with
nice
head
the
body
is
medium
and
the
flavor
of
bourbon
is
evident
this
is
a
nice
smooth
enjoyable
brew
whether
or
not
the
time
in
the
cellar
helped
or
hindered
isnt
really
an
issue
with
the
beer
because
the
characters
of
the
beer
are
in
good
shape
d
definitely
a
sipper
not
a
chugger
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
probably
because
of
the
bourbon
smell
so
this
lends
its
self
to
slow
enjoyment

d
i
havent
had
this
fresh
so
i
cant
comment
on
how
its
aged
but
its
tasty
in
its
current
state
well
balanced
with
a
decent
amount
of
depth
originally
reviewed
10312011
d
good
one
to
try
decent
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
one
with
a
full
body
i
get
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
on
the
first
sip
but
its
replaced
with
a
menagerie
of
flavors
that
just
overwhelm
the
palate
and
make
you
forget
that
its
slightly
syrupy
overall
not
a
bad
effort
this
beer
has
become
entirely
balanced
nothing
sharp
about
it
kind
of
strange
i
dont
think
it
really
works
bourbon
aging
this
beer
eh
i
keep
giving
them
chances
and
i
keep
trying
them
out
and
dammit
i
keep
spending
my
money
on
them
but
im
starting
to
wise
up
looks
nice
on
the
pour
feels
extremely
silly
and
smooth
flavor
profile
is
nice
and
smooth
mild
hop
spice
tones
lots
of
malts
im
getting
a
bit
of
a
vanilla
tone
here
too
overall
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
i
get
no
boozy
tones
and
im
pretty
sure
its
close
to
10
on
the
abv
from
what
i
recall
when
i
saw
the
bottle
a
nice
easy
drinker
pleasant
overall
3
0
a
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
at
someone
elses
expense
again
but
probably
wont
spend
11
on
again
myself
i
had
been
considering
putting
a
few
of
these
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
they
age
but
after
trying
it
decided
against
it
i
think
my
money
will
be
better
spent
on
other
offerings
in
this
category
still
a
palatable
brew
that
gets
the
job
done
o
a
touch
of
spice
but
loads
more
fruit
and
oversweet
molasses
malt
i
didnt
think
it
was
great
the
bourbon
was
heavyhanded
but
whatever
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
i
wont
have
again
o
oh
well
i
guess
everything
that
comes
out
of
the
cellar
cant
be
an
over
the
top
winner
not
bad
but
i
almost
remember
liking
this
one
better
fresh
i
shoulda
drank
this
one
by
the
fire
place
this
winter
instead
of
waiting
until
spring
oh
well
a
touch
too
much
bourbon
but
decently
drinkable
low
b
the
11
edition
bottled
aug
12
2011
id
have
to
say
its
overpriced
at
15
overall
its
what
i
expected
pretty
good
its
great
to
pair
with
a
cigar
i
would
love
to
get
it
solely
for
that
purpose
not
for
the
15
price
tag
i
see
everywhere
though
i
would
struggle
to
spend
9
on
it
but
that
seems
more
reasonable
good
but
overpriced
i
would
suggest
trying
it
once
if
you
have
some
extra
money
in
the
winter
when
it
comes
out
overall
not
a
bad
brew
in
general
but
very
oddtasting
my
guess
is
people
will
probably
love
it
or
hate
it
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruit
and
a
small
alcohol
in
the
taste
oaky
bourbon
and
a
dark
fruitiness
a
small
fruit
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
oak
and
bourbon
like
aftertaste
a
nice
bourbon
presence
in
a
barleywine
but
just
about
average
overall
complex
though
a
bit
too
smokey
and
burnt
in
all
honesty
this
has
probably
just
aged
a
bit
too
long
which
makes
sense
given
that
its
a
shade
under
10
i
so
wanted
this
beer
to
be
excellent
but
sadly
it
disappoints
o
huge
bourbon
punch
both
a
plus
and
a
minus
at
times
this
tastes
like
decent
bourbon
that
someone
just
poured
some
beer
into
overall
everything
doesnt
really
come
together
very
well
a
solid
idea
but
probably
could
have
been
better
executed
my
bet
is
that
this
beer
is
a
little
young
would
like
to
taste
this
once
it
has
had
a
chance
to
age
and
mellow
and
lose
some
heat
overall
its
ultimately
just
ok
i
certainly
dont
feel
as
though
i
got
my
thirteen
bucks
worth
with
this
one
overall
some
will
be
not
like
the
sweetness
due
to
the
bourbon
present
otherwise
this
is
a
great
bourbon
style
ale
that
offers
something
unique
and
enjoyable
to
those
looking
for
something
a
little
different
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
worthy
of
the
price

overall
i
enjoyed

the

the

the

overall
a
satisfactory
but
not
noteworthy
effort
there
is
hardly
any
carbonation
and
it
very
drinkable
was
so
glad
to
see
this
again
for
2011
it
is
just
one
of
those
winter
seasonals
i
dont
mind
paying
for
very
enjoyable
a
great
beer
drank
at
the
perfect
time
of
year
for
it
now
i
know
why
this
one
hasnt
moved
off
the
shelves
very
disappointing
everything
seems
off
final
thought
13
and
only
9

way
to
high
of
a

for
a
beer
that
is
just
ok
i
would
get
one

it
was
half

price

some
orangey

that
are
a
bit
resinous
a
touch

oak

and
only
a
slight
suggestion
of
bourbon
taste
has
quite
a
bit
of
the
same
orangeylike
hop
notes
which
as
i
move
through
the
bottle
come
across
as
more
and
more
artificial
with
lots
of
oak
butterscotch
almost
along
the
lines
of
an
innis

some
bourbon
flavour

any

in
the

low
slightly
more
drinkable
than
some
pure
sippers
out
there

sweet
for
my
liking
though
and
lacks
any
real
complexity
to
make
this
stand
out
despite
the
nice
looking

this
was
certainly
not
worth

i
dropped
on
this

up
being
too
much

this

for

certainly
hasnt

i
thought
it
was
good
now
i
might
have
to
buy
a
bottle
of
the
2011
version
to
try
overall
this
is
ok
i
really
enjoyed
brrr
but
this
treatment
of
that
beer
doesnt
work
all
that
well
i
guess
its
something
to
try
once
but
not
something
id
like
to
revist
i
had
such
high
hopes
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
bottled
in
oct
2010
this
pours
a
hazy
tea
color
with
a
very
small
short
lived
bad
the
smells
are
of
toffee
and
caramel
malts
with
a
little
bourbon
feel
is
medium
to
thick
with
a
little
extra
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
more
bourbon
taste
than
i
expected
with
the
smell
along
with
the
load
of
malts
pretty
great
stuff
strong
aroma
has
a
decided
overtone
of
bourbonsoaked
wood
as
well
as
fruity
and
malty
tones
it
pours
a
beautiful
clear
golden
amber
with
a
decent
light
golden
tan
head
flavor
has
a
strong
woody
bourbon
overtone
which
dominates
the
flavor
but
still
lets
through
malt
and
applepear
notes
plus
just
a
hint
of
caramel
smooth
texture
has
slightly
above
average
body
and
quite
a
bit
of
fizz
leaving
a
tingly
woody
finish
this
is
a
bold
beer
for
bold
people
overall
quite
an
interesting
take
on
a
winter
warmer
oak
and
vanilla
flavors
are
nice
could
of
been
a
little
more
full
bodied
poured
a
clear
lighter
shade
of
amber
with
a
thin
layer
of
tan
foam
that
receded
quickly
and
didnt
leave
much
if
any
lacing
smell
was
light
elements
of
bourbon
wood
vanilla
and
cherries
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
was
quite
the
same
with
vanilla
and
cherry
elements
mild
maltiness
reminds
on
this
is
a
beer
and
not
the
leftover
watery
remnants
of
an
inexpensive
kentucky
bourbon
on
the
rocks
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
held
together
okay
however
my
overall
impression
was
as
somebody
else
mentioned
bland
there
is
just
enough
of
an
initial
hint
of
bourbon
elements
to
get
a
person
excited
but
like
that
its
gone
final
notes
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
intense
brew
that
a
good
winter
warmer
should
it
has
the
abv
but
not
the
bold
assertive
flavors
to
back
it
up
quite
enjoyable
otherwise
not
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
but
you
might
want
to
check
it
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
bourbon
overall
the
bourbon
was
spot
on
in
this
one
for
its
price
and
availability
you
need
to
get
some
was
13
at
the
bar
but
i
had
seen
it
for
10
at
bottle
shops
solid
price
both
places
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
i
think
with
some
time
on
it
it
could
be
a
lot
better
and
would
age
it
if
i
had
it
in
a
bottle
really
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
does
seem
to
miss
the
mark
with
regard
to
the
middlethe
beer
could
use
a
stronger
grain
presence
i
really
do
enjoy
the
intense
bourbon
flavors
though
so
this
some
what
makes
up
for
the
lack
of
body
2011
vintage
sampled
at
a
group
tasting
of
several
new
releases
pours
a
pretty
orangetan
color
with
just
a
hint
of
a
creamy
white
head
aroma
is
big
on
the
bourbon
with
strong
notes
of
wood
vanilla
and
a
spicy
note
of
caraway
or
anise
palate
is
rich
and
sweet
with
a
lightly
fruit
hop
profile
mingling
with
the
assertive
malts
and
the
strong
bourbon
edge
leading
up
to
a
very
warm
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
right
now
but
i
think
a
few
months
of
aging
will
round
out
the
edges
and
make
this
an
excellent
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
color
minimal
head
with
little
retention
i
really
couldnt
get
any
aroma
off
of
this
beer
good
malt
taste
with
caramel
and
allspice
unfortunately
the
flavor
gets
milder
and
milder
over
just
a
few
sips
so
it
began
to
lose
me
a
bit
theres
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
it
is
a
very
smooth
beer
it
is
mediumbodied
with
light
yet
very
prickly
carbonation
an
enjoyable
and
mild
in
a
good
way
barrelaged
winter
warme
overall
all
id
have
to
say
it
a
decent
beer
but
not
worth
the
12
99
opinion
very
nice
smooth
beer
not
to
strong
of
flavors
but
a
nice
balance
of
an
aged
winter
warmer
and
bourbon
nice
beer
for
a
relaxing
evening
overall
an
ok
beer
i
would
buy
again
if
it
were
5
a
bottle
or
less
and
i
wanted
a
cheap
bourbon
barrel
beer
o
this
is
decent
and
has
potential
but
just
not
quite
on
the
mark
overall
im
missing
the
flavor
and
body
of
the
beers
i
usually
drink
the
beer
doesnt
have
any
objectionable
characteristics
but
it
faults
are
sins
of
omission
my
tastes
gravitate
to
upfront
flavorful
beers
i
just
find
this
one
lacking
overall
rather
enjoyable
take
on
a
winter
warmer
and
a
nice
break
from
the
giant
barrel
aged
stout
beers
i
would
have
this
again
anytime
real
nice
nose
on
this
too
overall
a
solid
barrelaged
winter
warmer
not
an
eyeopener
but
enough
there
to
enjoy
on
those
frosty
nights
still
wont
kill
myself
for
a
revisit
pours
a
dark
amber
color
w
a
thin
sliver
of
an
off
white
head
moderate
carbonation
and
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
beer
appears
clear
and
somewhat
easy
to
see
through
in
spite
of
the
color
the
nose
is
mainly
bourbon
oak
vanilla
a
little
on
the
simplistic
noncomplex
side
and
a
little
thin
taste
is
a
little
better
but
not
great
a
little
boozy
w
vanilla
and
oak
coming
through
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
syrupy
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
i
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
buying
regularly
or
even
ordering
on
tap
if
there
are
other
interesting
selections
i
do
like
the
effort
here
though
im
a
bit
disappointed
the
scent
really
implied
that
this
beer
had
potential
i
personally
however
am
not
a
big
fan
feel
like
this
beer
misses
the
mark
there
might
have
been
a
really
nice
palate
here
but
its
just
gone
missing
and
youre
left
with
little
more
than
warm
booze
notes
and
some
sweetness
around
the
edge
drinkability
suffers
because
of
the
heat
and
the
lack
of
complexities
and
characters
to
make
it
really
worthwhile
i
love
bourbon
oak
in
things
but
maybe
this
beer
is
telling
me
that
i
just
really
like
the
base
beer
in
others
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
barrel
aged
winter
warmer
i
liked
the
regular
version
of
brrr
but
this
is
even
better
d
very
smooth
and
surprisingly
light
overall
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
rather
crisp
and
snappy
for
a
winter
warmer
little
too
light
for
the
style
opinion
i
have
been
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
for
a
winter
warmer
it
is
pretty
darn
good
and
definitely
warming
there
are
some
mouthfeel
things
about
this
beer
that
i
would
like
to
modify
but
that
is
just
tweaking
even
as
a
low
carbonated
beer
it
comes
across
well
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
beer
again
i
look
forward
to
finishing
this
beer
but
it
will
most
certainly
put
me
to
bed
tonight
d
not
a
terrible
brew
but
not
very
impressive
nice
balance
between
the
bourbon
and
the
winter
warmer
but
the
body
overall
was
a
bit
watery
and
the
overall
flavor
was
too
simple
for
my
taste
the
aroma
was
boozy
with
lots
of
peat
and
smoked
malts
that
really
filled
the
air
hints
of
molasses
chocolate
rich
caramel
and
dark
fruits
all
make
their
presence
known
with
the
thickness
of
a
milkshake
the
first
sips
slide
over
the
palate
doing
their
best
to
coat
it
so
fully
you
do
not
even
know
where
to
start
just
tremendous
in
every
aspect
rich
smoked
malts
and
sweet
flavors
finish
the
job
with
a
kick
of
smooth
boozy
oak
and
bourbon
to
round
it
out
since
i
love
the
widmer
brr
winter
release
i
figured
my
love
would
follow
to
their
brrbon
it
looked
and
smelled
fantastic
but
it
must
be
that
i
am
not
a
big
hard
alcohol
fan
that
all
i
could
taste
was
the
burbon
couldnt
even
taaste
the
brrr
beer
i
am
glad
i
only
paid
a
few
bucks
for
a
glass
vs
the
cost
of
the
bottle
overall
this
is
the
first
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
thst
i
have
had
that
was
not
a
stout
and
i
like
this
better
than
most
of
them
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
amberish
brown
color
the
head
was
an
off
white
and
looked
pretty
nice
for
the
most
part
the
lacing
didnt
exist
the
smell
was
a
little
sweet
and
had
a
touch
of
booze
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
nice
it
had
some
good
bourbon
flavors
in
there
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
bad
smooth
and
carbonated
overall
it
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
o
a
miss
wanted
more
bourbon
less
winter
warmer
with
that
said
its
a
damn
good
winter
warmer
considering
this
is
easily
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
id
like
to
definitely
give
this
another
run
maybe
pair
this
bad
boy
with
some
fish
tacos
or
jamaican
jerk
chicken
the
second
drain
pour
i
have
ever
had
to
do
and
documented
because
even
the
cellaring
mistakes
are
important
to
learn
from
and
not
repeat
bottle
poured
a
clear
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
bourbon
is
quite
powerful
with
notes
of
sweet
malt
taste
is
also
dominated
by
lots
of
vanilla
notes
from
the
bourbon
barrel
with
a
balanced
sweet
malt
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
light
apparent
alcohol
notes
interesting
though
not
properly
balanced
with
too
much
bourbon
o
im
not
a
huge
whisky
guy
but
this
is
delicious
im
drinking
this
on
june
1st
and
im
visualizing
myself
sipping
this
near
a
fireplace
on
a
cold
night
the
abv
may
warm
you
up
on
a
chilly
night
while
camping
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
when
available
o
super
tame
but
whats
there
is
good
o
the
flavor
that
is
there
is
tasty
but
it
isnt
very
bold
i
like
whats
there
buuut
medium
amber
color
hints
of
vanilla
malt
and
bourbon
bourbon
bomb
i
love
bourbon
forward
beers
but
there
is
so
much
bourbon
that
theres
not
room
for
much
else
some
malt
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
citrus
carbonated
light
mouthfeel
good
but
not
up
to
the
pre
drink
expectations
i
had
on
it
might
still
get
another
bottle
to
age
but
then
again
maybe
not
p
s
marinated
a
brisket
with
this
beer
and
it
is
wonderful
in
a
different
category
this
beer
would
be
all
4
5s
this
has
a
great
aroma
and
a
nice
taste
it
has
that
bourbon
sweetness
o
this
beer
was
average
at
best
with
the
flavor
profile
i
had
it
could
be
it
needs
to
lay
for
a
bit
but
i
thought
the
bourbon
was
a
bit
too
much
the
other
flavors
never
had
a
chance
to
shine
which
was
my
only
problem
with
this
beer
o
its
ok
flavor
is
actually
good
but
it
loses
points
on
everything
o
overall
an
okay
beer
but
probably
not
worth
going
crazy
to
seek
out
either
way
i
enjoyed
it
more
so
on
the
second
glass
o
an
average
beer
the
bourbon
seems
unbalanced
and
not
profiled
effectively
not
a
bad
drinker
but
i
wouldnt
look
for
this
again
o
very
good
winter
ale
bourbon
improves
it
i
would
drink
this
again
i
feel
like
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
on
a
cold
winter
night
than
on
a
balmy
spring
one
not
bad
by
any
means
but
not
particularly
spectacular
either
overall
its
worth
giving
a
shot
o
unimaginative
this
beer
doesnt
really
boast
anything
impressive
all
in
all
its
above
average
but
it
seems
to
be
little
more
than
sweet
buttery
malts
and
bourbon
if
you
buy
this
you
should
age
it
at
least
6
months
to
allow
the
bourbon
flavors
to
mellow
out
its
strong
but
it
wont
kill
your
taste
buds
after
a
month
or
two
unfortunately
its
a
pretty
shallow
beer
that
only
exists
to
showcase
bourbon
barrel
aging
and
nothing
more
an
aggressive
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
that
is
akin
to
lexingtons
bourbon
barrel
ale
where
ba
brrrbon
has
a
more
heafty
malt
base
the
bourbon
character
lacks
in
taste
but
makes
it
boozy
more
than
it
needs
to
be
the
barrel
elements
oak
vanilla
bourbon
are
rather
restrained
in
the
nose
vaguely
fruity
and
hoppy
i
taste
some
of
the
prickly
hoppiness
of
regular
brrr
but
its
somewhat
neutered
im
not
sure
the
base
beer
has
the
malt
profile
to
hold
up
to
barrelaging
the
body
seems
on
the
thin
side
the
bourbon
is
so
subtle
as
to
not
add
much
to
the
equation
and
the
barrel
notes
are
more
raw
wood
than
butteryoakvanilla
a
decent
beer
for
sure
but
something
seems
to
be
lacking
regular
brrr
is
certainly
superior
medium
sticky
body
on
this
with
soft
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
didnt
care
for
it
i
wonder
how
the
regular
version
is
though
o
this
is
a
good
choice
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
that
has
bourbon
flavors
but
isnt
very
overpowering
ultraclear
deep
copper
in
color
with
a
very
slim
head
this
beer
has
a
boozy
malty
aroma
some
woody
smoky
aroma
but
very
distant
vinous
semisweet
warming
and
malty
the
beer
has
a
distinct
vanilla
flavor
mouthfilling
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
this
is
surely
a
sipping
beer
solid
bitterness
but
hoprestrained
the
beer
becomes
more
enjoyable
and
intriguing
throughout
the
bottle
very
good
its
a
pretty
nice
strong
bourbon
barrelaged
ale
but
the
price
12
95
is
out
of
whack
would
the
rating
be
higher
if
it
were
9
95
no
but
it
would
have
been
a
far
more
reasonable
value
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
but
it
had
no
complexity
whatsoever
just
bourbon
it
was
worth
trying
but
for
how
much
it
costs
it
really
wasnt
worth
it
for
what
i
got
o
when
i
go
to
review
this
beer
i
find
myself
nitpicking
and
finding
reasons
not
to
give
it
an
excellent
review
but
i
like
it
enough
to
have
bought
numerous
1012
bottles
throughout
the
last
6
months
and
recommend
it
to
many
friends
i
really
love
the
bourbon
taste
in
this
beer
and
the
overall
package
drinks
easy
for
the
abv
a
nice
take
on
the
style
not
the
best
barrel
aged
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
if
the
price
is
right
d
needs
plenty
of
time
in
the
bottle
they
shouldnt
have
released
this
yet
too
young
overall
enjoyable
in
the
line
up
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
this
is
on
the
lighter
side
an
easy
drinker
that
with
its
moderate
abv
is
worth
enjoying
drinkability
i
think
that
the
brrbon
is
fairly
drinkable
i
think
the
drink
is
a
little
unbalanced
with
the
bourbon
taking
over
too
much
of
the
taste
however
i
would
not
say
the
beer
is
undrinkable
but
the
bourbon
makes
it
harder
to
finish
the
bottle
because
of
the
strong
bourbon
taste
otherwise
i
thin
it
is
a
fairly
okay
drink
for
a
cold
winter
day
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
dark
beer
for
some
reason
i
am
curious
if
they
were
using
alagash
curieux
as
their
inspiration
because
i
can
see
some
similarities
good
beer
and
since
it
is
a
limited
release
you
should
pick
one
up
an
try
it
soon
before
its
gone
cheers
some
have
suggested
this
might
be
better
aged
longer
that
might
be
so
but
i
dont
see
me
looking
for
a
second
bottle
to
find
out
i
really
feel
bad
because
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
beer
and
the
taste
is
like
a
watered
down
glass
of
oak
bourbon
and
light
caramel
for
what
i
paid
for
the
bottle
ill
have
to
finish
this
one
widmer
brothers
no
offense
with
this
review
im
going
to
give
this
one
another
go
around
on
the
next
batch
because
i
really
enjoy
bourbon
beers
this
one
just
aint
doin
it
for
me
sorry
to
say
overall
its
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
but
not
that
enjoyable
brrrbon
is
amazing
this
is
why
i
love
barrel
age
beer
and
think
bourbon
barrels
are
probably
my
favorite
after
having
tried
a
variety
i
am
not
a
bourbon
drinker
but
something
about
the
way
the
flavor
of
the
spirit
compliments
the
flavor
profile
of
the
imperial
red
brrr
really
hits
the
spot
the
nose
and
the
first
sip
of
the
beer
are
the
absolute
best
because
your
pallet
is
overwhelmed
with
all
of
the
flavors
a
little
pricey
but
anytime
you
age
something
thatll
run
up
the
cost
cheers
mouthfeelmedium
carbonation
delivers
a
quick
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
immediately
overcome
by
the
sweet
malt
and
it
transitions
to
a
wonderful
bourbon
flavor
there
is
a
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
back
on
the
finish
but
i
am
left
with
a
sweet
lowerproof
bourbon
flavor
a
froth
on
the
palate
gets
the
alcohol
warmed
up
and
some
mild
oaky
barrel
flavors
emerge
if
you
can
envision
a
pefect
combo
of
a
beer
mixed
with
bourbon
this
ale
hits
the
spot
i
like
the
subtle
oak
flavors
and
the
sweet
bourbon
flavors
are
pleasing
to
me
i
am
big
bourbon
fan
so
this
was
a
great
brew
to
try
cheers
to
widmer
brothers
on
this
special
release
d
easily
drinkable
just
really
not
worth
seeking
out
or
paying
msrp
either
if
you
will
conclusion
this
is
truly
the
most
unique
bourbon
barrelaged
beer
ive
tried
but
in
short
if
you
like
bourbon
just
go
buy
some
actual
bourbon
because
itll
be
cheaper
than
the
barrel
aged
brrrbon
and
probably
taste
better
this
just
tastes
like
bad
bourbon
and
even
worse
beer
it
is
totally
undrinkable
unless
you
are
bourbon
fiend
balance
is
just
nonexistant
glad
i
tried
it
but
never
again
firstworldproblems
feels
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
an
easy
drinker
despite
the
9
abv
it
would
be
easy
to
have
more
than
one
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
overall
drinkability
is
good
but
im
left
feeling
a
little
empty
because
the
base
beer
winter
warmer
doesnt
really
show
up
here
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
retention
of
lacing
thin
collar
as
the
head
falls
the
nose
definitely
packs
in
the
brrrbon
but
thats
unfortunately
about
it
theres
some
slight
malt
character
in
the
background
but
nothing
all
that
complex
about
this
the
taste
is
comprised
mostly
of
brrrbon
along
with
some
sweetened
malt
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
boozy
and
medium
drinkability
is
decent
though
theres
really
nothing
at
all
special
about
this
if
it
werent
so
damned
expensive
id
buy
up
the
stock
in
the
area
but
it
was
on
tap
which
made
it
much
more
attractive
to
me
the
brothers
are
continuing
their
quest
with
this
reserve
series
tawny
clarity
a
beautiful
head
rests
on
top
oak
and
alcohol
are
the
first
to
the
nostrils
with
clean
solvent
trace
vanilla
and
toasted
wood
fullbodied
slickness
barrel
flavor
has
a
slight
chokehold
on
this
beer
tasting
a
whole
lot
of
wood
toasted
watereddown
bourbon
to
faint
vanilla
and
a
dry
pull
on
the
palate
modest
hop
profile
and
the
maltiness
is
quite
dry
expected
more
of
an
alcohol
presence
between
the
barrel
and
higher
alcohol
mellow
up
front
but
warming
in
the
back
a
bit
more
malt
to
back
up
the
barrel
flavors
would
have
worked
wood
seems
to
take
over
widmer
barrel
aged
brrrbon
is
a
classic
example
of
the
adage
that
its
best
not
to
mess
with
success
im
sure
the
brewerys
goal
was
to
improve
upon
an
already
good
beer
sorry
but
mission
not
accomplished
the
brew
is
similar
from
the
preceding
offering
but
the
barrel
blending
has
improved
nothing
extraordinary
but
the
11
vintage
would
deserve
an
overall
4
grade
and
would
be
a
fair
candidate
for
aging
enjoy
the
beer
has
potential
but
not
worth
the
10
price
tag
for
a
bomber
would
like
to
see
this
one
revisited
but
beef
up
the
base
beer
first
ive
ahad
a
couple
brews
already
so
my
review
may
not
be
complete
but
i
know
this
is
a
top
quality
beer
d
drinkable
nothing
offensive
or
offflavored
just
lacks
character
taste
is
syrupy
sweet
to
start
a
peek
of
fruittart
in
the
middle
and
then
vanilla
alcohol
and
a
lingering
coconut
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
easy
especially
for
the
abv
nice
brew
even
though
im
not
the
biggest
coconut
flavor
fan
d
great
to
try
not
to
buy
it
was
great
to
have
a
bourbon
aged
beer
not
a
whiskey
bomb
but
clocking
in
at
16
99
i
didnt
even
dare
to
consider
buying
a
bottle
but
you
pay
for
the
process
so
its
high
for
a
reason
would
be
better
if
the
price
was
a
solid
10
then
i
would
have
got
it
for
sure
bottle
at
the
december
santa
cruz
tasting
pours
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
head
strong
bourbony
aroma
with
a
watery
caramel
bourbon
flavor
very
thin
and
quite
the
letdown
after
the
adequate
aroma
candied
sweet
boozy
thin
with
a
short
finish
not
impressed
little
to
no
carbonation
in
the
feel
and
i
honestly
am
having
trouble
finishing
this
bottle
as
the
bartender
slid
the
snifter
glass
across
the
bar
i
was
to
say
the
least
a
little
excited
held
up
against
the
light
a
very
nice
briliant
amber
and
small
creamy
head
so
far
so
good
but
then
to
the
nose
and
i
was
taken
aback
the
smooth
bourbon
and
oak
notes
are
intoxicating
then
to
the
taste
and
my
mind
swirled
so
balanced
so
smooth
so
easy
to
drink
every
sip
was
wonderful
and
it
wasnt
until
i
got
outside
into
the
fresh
air
did
i
feel
the
alcohal
best
beer
i
have
tried
in
along
time
i
bought
a
bomber
to
cellar
but
i
dont
know
if
that
plan
will
work
out
as
every
time
i
see
the
bottle
on
the
shelf
i
want
to
crack
it
and
experiance
that
again
pours
an
offwhite
onefinger
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
traces
of
lace
nice
crystal
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
bourbon
nose
flavor
is
bourbon
vanilla
and
hints
of
sweet
caramel
higher
abv
is
hidden
expensive
at
13
00
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
d
this
beer
was
pretty
bad
hard
to
drink
and
i
would
not
drink
it
again
m
slightly
oily
with
just
under
a
medium
body
and
mild
carbonation
22oz
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
crisp
copper
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
bourbon
in
front
of
caramel
malts
and
mild
spice
the
taste
is
a
nice
smooth
blend
of
caramel
malts
bourbon
oak
vanilla
and
cinnamon
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
mild
alcohol
but
its
still
quite
smooth
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
bourbon
aged
beer
i
plan
on
aging
the
bottle
i
have
at
home
the
bourbon
flavor
was
a
little
subtler
than
expected
with
almost
no
alcohol
burn
this
drank
quite
easily
and
was
pleasant
enough
but
it
didnt
really
attain
memorable
big
bourbon
beer
status
i
liked
but
couldnt
buy
that
one
yet
maybe
with
time
it
will
improve
but
a
tap
is
supposed
to
be
the
top
taste
right
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
foamy
off
white
head
the
smell
is
strong
with
hops
and
a
hint
of
bourbon
from
the
barrels
the
beer
is
aged
in
the
taste
starts
with
some
malty
sweetness
and
then
hits
you
with
hoppy
bitterness
the
taste
finishes
with
that
hint
of
bourbon
but
is
not
very
overpowering
like
some
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
the
high
alcohol
content
is
obvious
within
the
taste
which
is
the
only
big
detractor
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
smooth
although
you
are
left
with
some
bitter
aftertaste
i
thought
it
went
down
pretty
easy
and
both
of
us
like
it
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
a
few
more
and
the
price
is
right
at
12
95
o
for
the
price
there
are
many
many
beers
that
are
better
than
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
surprisingly
light
rosy
golden
amber
color
with
a
shallow
wispy
fizzy
white
head
thats
gone
in
a
flash
leaving
little
belgian
lacing
at
all
microscopic
effervescence
is
unable
to
sustain
a
collar
but
suggests
a
reasonable
carbonation
will
follow
the
nose
is
really
timid
until
it
warms
up
then
its
all
about
the
vanilla
creme
brulee
the
taste
is
big
on
the
sweet
vanilla
character
of
the
bourbon
treatment
a
little
caramel
creme
brulee
thing
going
on
the
mouth
feel
is
tangy
and
creamy
all
at
once
and
it
compliments
the
flavor
nicely
it
has
a
sturdy
medium
weight
to
the
body
it
finishes
on
the
dry
side
with
a
meager
lingering
aftertaste
quite
the
reasonable
drinker
for
one
up
at
9
4
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
if
it
was
on
the
shelves
but
im
a
sucker
for
bourbon
treatments
pours
a
dark
orange
colour
with
small
white
head
lack
of
lacing
on
the
glass
poor
head
retention
smells
like
oranges
bourbon
and
vanilla
flavour
is
quite
boozy
not
very
carbonated
my
review
may
make
it
sound
more
negative
than
i
thought
about
the
beer
i
did
enjoy
this
one
enough
one
of
the
better
widmer
beers
ive
had
although
i
initially
balked
at
buying
this
one
due
to
the
perceived
pricequality
ratio
i
relented
the
other
day
because
i
had
a
gift
card
i
received
for
christmas
and
the
curiosity
was
killing
me
that
said
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
was
hardly
blown
away
poured
a
hazy
dark
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
dense
yellowish
head
aromas
of
bourbon
light
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
caramel
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
bourbon
oak
and
caramel
an
enjoyable
beer
to
be
certain
but
not
worth
the
12
asking
price
notes
it
may
have
been
unfair
of
me
to
review
this
beer
since
im
not
a
fan
of
bourbon
i
prefer
irish
whiskey
its
a
bit
impressive
how
much
bourbon
character
they
managed
to
impart
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
subtle
i
remember
brrr
as
being
pretty
hoppy
so
i
was
expecting
more
hop
presence
but
i
guess
the
aging
process
killed
it
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
bourbon
lover
but
others
should
probably
pass
thank
you
widmer
this
lost
a
few
points
because
anyone
can
just
put
beer
in
bourbon
barrels
provided
they
have
the
funds
to
do
so
and
the
rest
of
the
beers
character
isnt
showing
through
much
dont
get
me
wrong
i
cant
say
i
disliked
drinking
this
with
a
friend
at
all
wow
how
disappointed
am
i
this
is
not
a
good
beer
and
for
the
price
i
am
doubly
disappointed
not
recommended
dm
slight
carbonation
tingle
warms
the
pallet
and
the
body
as
it
is
sipped
sue
to
the
whiskey
notes
smooth
on
the
pallet
drinks
quite
easily
went
over
to
a
friends
last
night
and
he
had
a
surprise
for
me
it
was
poured
into
standard
pint
glasses
the
pour
was
copper
with
a
medium
white
head
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
beer
was
sweet
some
honey
the
main
theme
was
light
bourbon
very
warming
but
not
overwhelming
the
beer
was
medium
in
body
and
had
a
sticky
mouthfeel
the
beer
was
dangerously
drinkable
a
good
beer
but
overpriced
d
nothing
too
impressive
but
interesting
nonetheless
give
it
a
try
if
you
feel
like
paying
a
premium
price
for
a
mediocre
brew
this
is
very
meh
the
bourbon
is
perfect
for
the
malt
and
the
malt
is
fine
but
the
spice
and
the
hops
just
dont
work
for
me
everything
told
me
that
this
would
be
a
great
and
amazing
brew
at
10
99
for
a
22oz
bottle
it
had
better
be
widmer
is
the
only
american
brand
in
which
id
risk
this
purchase
but
wow
widmer
has
outdone
themselves
again
this
is
by
far
the
best
new
beer
i
have
tried
in
a
long
time
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
color
the
aroma
of
the
bourbon
barrels
mixes
well
with
the
light
citrus
and
vanilla
aromatics
there
is
little
head
no
carbonation
and
the
perfect
taste
if
there
ever
was
beer
perfection
this
is
it
d
this
was
not
bad
but
not
great
the
scent
and
taste
and
body
all
left
something
to
be
desired
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
bad
so
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
even
though
i
tried
this
fresh
it
seemed
like
the
bottle
was
old
so
this
probably
wont
improve
further
with
age
if
you
want
a
barrel
aged
ale
nonstout
you
can
find
better
elsewhere
mdlight
body
with
some
dextrinous
and
creamy
character
i
like
the
clean
alcohol
sting
at
the
end
it
carries
with
it
some
baby
aspirin
flavor
to
dry
out
the
finish
definite
caramel
color
that
is
superb
has
an
average
smell
that
really
gives
off
the
bourbon
flavor
i
personally
love
bourbon
so
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
not
an
overwhelming
flavor
but
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
does
hit
you
in
the
finish
line
smooth
and
drinkable
perhaps
the
best
qualities
of
the
beer
only
there
is
a
light
mouthfeel
where
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
body
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
at
9
4
but
drinking
like
a
45
beer
extremely
clean
and
blanced
its
a
good
thing
i
only
have
one
d
easy
drinking
because
the
body
is
thin
i
think
this
is
an
average
beer
and
the
total
package
seems
overpriced
does
not
leave
me
craving
more
and
really
does
not
seem
all
that
special
not
very
drinkable
due
to
the
one
dimensional
nature
of
the
flavor
and
aroma
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
some
very
complex
characters
going
on
in
this
brew
some
of
which
are
not
completely
complimentary
altogether
though
it
is
somewhat
pleasing
and
although
i
like
bourbon
as
much
as
the
next
fellow
a
beer
that
is
more
like
a
hopped
bourbon
than
a
beer
kissed
with
bourbon
character
doesnt
do
it
for
me
perhaps
it
would
benefit
from
a
year
or
more
in
the
cellar
but
at
this
young
age
it
reminds
me
too
much
of
when
i
used
to
drop
a
shotglass
of
jack
into
a
frosty
mug
of
bud
before
i
knew
what
good
beer
was
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
worth
the
price
though
in
my
opinion
so
far
i
like
this
the
least
of
the
3
limited
releases
by
these
guys
but
then
again
they
always
say
the
1st
is
the
best
all
in
all
a
mixed
bag
some
weird
aftertastes
going
on
here
and
it
aint
cheap
but
i
find
it
growing
on
me
i
cant
imagine
the
ingredients
are
all
that
expensive
are
they
so
why
the
high
price
at
first
while
the
beer
was
still
cold
from
the
fridge
the
taste
was
nothing
spectacular
and
immediately
presented
a
bourbon
burn
at
the
back
of
my
throat
when
i
went
in
too
fast
my
second
time
around
i
took
it
slower
still
feeling
the
bourbon
melting
my
insides
as
it
slid
down
my
throat
and
tasted
around
other
than
some
wintery
spiciness
i
pulled
out
some
pineyresiny
hops
that
were
missing
in
the
nose
lots
of
damp
oak
and
wood
sweet
toffee
malts
caramel
and
light
vanilla
all
of
which
combined
on
my
tongue
to
make
a
thin
sticky
syrup
flavorfeeling
that
was
slick
going
down
it
held
a
light
to
mediumlight
body
which
i
did
not
expect
though
with
the
amount
of
bright
tingly
carbonation
in
this
beer
theres
not
much
room
for
it
to
be
thicker
i
guess
i
assumed
it
would
be
more
rounded
and
smooth
but
instead
it
popped
in
my
mouth
with
the
bright
bubbles
ending
on
a
slightly
dry
note
the
barrel
aged
brrrbon
wasnt
too
shabby
its
not
going
to
be
my
goto
winter
beer
regardless
of
how
warm
it
made
me
with
its
9
4abv
but
it
was
definitely
unique
i
only
wish
it
was
more
like
beer
with
more
diverse
grains
malts
and
hops
and
focused
less
on
the
woody
bourbon
barrel
aging
flavors
though
i
suppose
without
all
the
wood
and
sweet
warming
alcohol
it
wouldnt
have
much
place
as
a
limited
release
brothers
reserve
would
it
pours
clear
copper
and
headless
to
be
a
bit
ghoulish
looks
like
bourbon
really
smells
like
wood
it
smells
specifically
like
wood
stored
in
a
cellar
earthy
damp
and
metallic
taste
is
strongly
woody
with
orange
notes
and
a
honeylike
finish
too
sweet
in
the
finish
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
slick
the
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
sweet
woody
finish
this
is
a
great
idea
but
the
wood
aging
just
seems
to
overpower
everything
else
pours
barleywinelike
in
appearance
with
larger
tan
head
than
expected
nose
has
some
woody
toffee
notes
and
perhaps
a
whiff
of
mixed
nuts
alcohol
warmth
is
noted
right
away
on
palate
with
the
bourbon
influence
revealing
itself
right
away
some
of
that
woody
toffee
comes
through
on
the
palate
as
well
but
not
terribly
sweet
black
tea
flavors
there
too
finishes
semi
sweet
with
boozy
quality
overall
i
dont
think
ill
drink
this
again
too
much
bourbon
not
enough
beer
d
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
bourbon
barrel
beers
but
if
i
want
something
like
this
ill
grab
either
a
bourbon
barrel
stout
for
more
pronounced
bourbon
taste
or
a
barleywine
my
least
favorite
of
the
brothers
reserve
series
so
far
drinkabilityits
probably
unfair
to
judge
this
one
at
so
young
an
age
likely
these
flavors
will
get
better
with
some
time
in
a
cellar
that
being
said
some
other
young
beers
that
are
similar
aged
were
much
smoother
surprisingly
smooth
flavor
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
an
appropriate
beer
while
watching
barry
melrose
dish
out
some
harsh
words
for
nhlers
aint
that
right
vdubb
it
pours
a
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
nearly
two
fingers
of
slightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
coconutenhanced
suntan
lotion
oak
caramel
light
cocoa
powder
cheap
whiskey
circus
peanuts
candy
and
rye
bread
the
taste
bludgeons
me
with
rubbery
whiskey
and
oak
while
the
caramel
rye
and
light
hot
cinnamon
cower
in
the
corner
lest
they
get
the
full
wrath
of
the
drunken
abusive
brrrbon
tones
man
they
are
really
trying
way
too
hard
here
the
body
is
a
strangely
stolid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slimily
dry
finish
overall
im
not
at
all
impressed
with
this
brew
it
tries
way
too
hard
to
be
a
nice
barrelaged
ww
but
instead
succeeds
only
at
making
me
angry
i
dont
want
to
drink
any
more
of
this
again
period
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
consists
of
overwhelming
bourbon
notes
along
with
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
notes
piney
and
citrusy
hops
and
a
big
whiff
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
also
dominated
by
bourbon
notes
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
and
brown
sugar
along
with
piney
hops
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
drinkability
is
pretty
limited
really
this
just
tastes
like
a
slightly
toned
down
bourbon
and
the
alcohol
overwhelms
anything
else
going
on
in
the
beer
this
beer
looks
a
nice
orangish
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
foam
that
laces
well
the
smell
is
citrus
and
oak
there
is
a
slight
malt
aroma
mixed
with
the
pleasant
hop
aroma
the
woodsy
aroma
is
mirrored
in
spades
with
this
beers
flavor
there
is
a
strong
boozy
flavor
with
this
beer
that
bites
on
the
tongue
i
really
dont
like
the
fact
that
i
have
wood
in
my
mouth
the
mouthfeel
while
spicy
isnt
that
bad
the
overall
drinkability
comes
into
question
here
solely
due
to
the
taste
here
the
rest
of
it
is
the
saving
grace
holy
crap
this
is
intense
if
you
like
barrels
you
can
taste
this
one
enjoy
ive
had
bourbon
barrele
beer
before
and
it
was
phenomenal
ive
had
other
widmer
brothers
brews
that
were
great
this
one
is
simply
average
and
for
the
price
would
not
recommend
or
buy
again
only
reason
im
still
drinking
is
i
dont
want
to
waste
10
worth
of
beer
d
the
base
beer
was
just
not
complex
or
big
enough
to
handle
the
barrel
just
because
you
can
throw
a
beer
in
a
barrel
does
not
mean
you
should
drinkability
moderate
complexity
a
decent
sipping
brew
would
likely
age
well
a
disappointment
no
nuance
nothing
is
incorporated
well
and
just
not
very
interesting
widmer
just
jumped
on
the
barrel
aged
band
wagon
here
without
any
thought
of
the
end
product
i
would
not
recommended
this
the
body
was
a
bit
too
thin
drinkability
was
ok
but
i
dont
think
ill
want
more
than
this
one
22
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
boring
one
try
it
if
you
want
but
i
think
your
time
will
be
better
spent
elsewhere
dokay
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
worth
a
try
though
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
pretty
silky
smooth
carbonation
is
moderate
and
perhaps
a
little
high
overall
drinkability
isnt
bad
it
really
had
some
good
bourbon
and
barrel
flavors
that
were
surprisingly
smooth
what
it
didnt
have
though
is
depth
the
base
beer
just
didnt
bring
enough
to
table
to
add
much
to
the
barrel
flavors
it
was
a
decent
drink
on
this
cold
evening
but
not
a
great
one
overall
alcohol
is
hid
well
this
is
not
bad
it
is
very
thin
in
the
body
thats
the
only
real
knock
on
this
beer
could
be
thicker
have
another
bottle
to
age
in
about
a
year
we
will
see
whats
up
kens
bottle
nice
drinkability
corny
bourbon
aroma
yellow
body
lagerishg
look
with
carbonation
bubbles
and
big
soapy
head
orangey
oil
herbal
orange
flavours
surprisingly
bourbon
in
secondary
maybe
some
vanilla
and
sugar
booze
felt
but
not
predominant
overall
there
is
a
welcoming
winter
brew
character
to
this
beer
that
fits
the
season
nicely
the
bourbon
oak
aroma
is
like
sticking
your
nose
in
a
freshly
toasted
oak
barrel
typically
i
find
oak
aged
beers
have
a
deeper
wood
presence
but
the
barrel
aging
here
tells
of
youthful
oak
personally
i
enjoy
the
change
but
some
will
find
the
wood
to
be
too
green
i
imagine
verdict
crazy
alcoholic
and
fun
like
jordan
but
not
worth
it
dont
let
the
bad
reviews
fool
you
this
actually
a
well
done
barrel
aged
beer
if
you
like
things
like
nemesis
2009
and
weyerbacher
insanity
nicely
oaky
well
played
widmer
d
for
13
this
is
not
worth
it
in
the
least
maybe
at
a
5
or
6
pricepoint
it
would
be
worth
getting
again
for
a
cold
winter
day
but
this
is
far
too
overpriced
even
with
the
bourbon
as
mellow
as
it
is
it
still
overpowers
everything
too
thin
also
why
was
this
winter
warmer
released
in
september
d
a
twist
on
a
likable
addition
to
last
years
winter
lineup
still
awfully
warm
right
now
a
fact
that
affects
drinkability
somewhat
worth
a
try
another
goodinteresting
effort
from
the
bros
reserve
line
and
something
ill
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
of
for
aging
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
13
the
dtrain
was
pretty
disappointed
i
certainly
wont
be
buying
this
again
skip
it
poured
with
a
small
light
tan
head
that
mostly
subsides
in
short
order
with
a
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
rich
medium
amber
with
slow
bubble
trails
aroma
is
malt
brandy
dark
ripe
fruit
flavor
is
like
nose
with
the
malt
and
brandy
more
pronounced
plus
the
tang
of
carbonation
body
is
a
little
thinner
than
id
expect
in
this
style
but
good
and
carbonation
is
assertive
finish
is
like
flavor
with
lots
of
warming
alcohol
decent
beer
for
a
sipper
not
bad
but
not
great
nice
enough
but
close
but
no
cigar
drink
a
bit
of
a
letdown
brrrbon
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
it
suffers
from
the
same
symptoms
as
the
other
subpar
widmer
reserve
series
beer
braggot
for
the
price
tag
i
just
expect
more
flavor
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
pretty
tame
on
bourbon
and
all
still
drinkable
for
price
ill
definitely
be
keeping
an
eye
on
widmer
brothers

certainly
a
nice
offering
but
it
seems
to
be
missing
some
depth
and
grain
more
light
and
sweet
but
i
am
thinking
with
a
couple
years
on
this
bottle
it
will
turn
out
much
better
mouthfeel
itself
is
nice
weighing
in
as
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
suffers
from
the
aforementioned
symptoms
see
im
wise
enough
to
know
when
a
gift
needs
givin
i
like
this
beer
for
the
winter
time
this
beer
is
like
drinking
a
glass
of
french
toast
and
not
in
a
good
way
too
sweet
pretty
bad
spiced
beer
with
too
much
going
on
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
has
great
flavors
of
gingerbread
spices
and
malt
extremely
tasty
recommended
looks
good
but
thats
about
it
reeks
of
spices
that
overpowers
med
to
lght
feel
offer
not
much
to
be
enjoyed
a
very
good
beer
tasty
i
love
this
beer
with
dessert
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
warms
my
belly
aroma
of
mild
nutmeg
cinnamon
toasted
malt
cereal
taste
sweet
malt
slight
nutmeg
brown
sugar
not
bad
mild
coffee
notes
in
the
nose
followed
by
a
nice
smooth
full
bodied
brew
with
a
good
coffee
and
cinnamon
flavor
definitely
a
cold
weather
ale
but
very
good
not
good
review
is
redundant
words
for
nothing
spice
bomb
very
thin
very
unimpressive
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
full
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
taste
has
those
spices
in
the
beginning
but
then
mellows
into
the
toasted
malt
which
i
thought
gave
a
nice
finish
to
the
beer
simple
but
effective
easy
on
palate
clove
nutmeg
sweet
but
light
amazing
winter
beer
worth
a
try
for
sure
on
draft
pours
a
dark
ruddy
brown
cinnamon
and
cloves
heavy
on
the
nose
lighter
bodied
than
i
expected
flavor
is
strong
straight
forward
winter
spicing
a
little
cinnamonsugary
not
terrible
but
not
my
favorite
became
more
and
more
cloying
as
i
went
overall
personally
this
beer
was
not
at
all
to
my
tastes
way
too
sweet
and
too
many
spices
tasted
more
like
a
heavily
spiced
cider
than
a
beer
to
me
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
that
i
ever
tasted
but
my
brother
who
bought
it
loves
it
so
it
has
it
fans
i
am
definitely
not
one
i
guess
i
have
learned
this
fall
that
i
dont
really
care
for
most
apple
pumpkin
or
cinnamonnutneg
spiced
beers
in
general
a
nice
winter
warmer
but
definitely
not
my
style
o
one
note
note
balanced
no
complexity
o
while
im
generally
a
malt
fan
i
am
a
fan
of
wellexecuted
malt
this
beer
seems
either
simple
but
poorly
integrated
or
an
attempt
at
being
complex
that
did
not
quite
gel
its
not
terrible
but
it
is
right
around
average
if
you
pick
friends
that
are
interesting
but
not
flashy
heres
your
chance
to
make
a
new
one
skol
overall
its
ok
taste
is
again
heavy
on
the
spices
this
ones
not
too
sweet
but
definitely
a
mellow
sipper
with
all
the
warm
spices
harpoons
winter
warmer
effectively
and
accurately
captures
the
spirit
of
wintertime
and
holiday
vibes

smells
of
winter
spices
a
tad
of
cinnamon
tastes
of
cinnamon
in
my
mouth
with
carbonation
beer
is
not
overly
drinkable
for
its
light
body
but
overpowering
spices
overall
a
below
average
beer
o
i
couldnt
finish
it
overall
a
tasty
but
underwhelming
winter
ale
rather
bland
and
unintneresting
although
the
spice
is
interesting
not
much
beer
flavor
to
be
found
i
really
dont
understand
the
ratings
on
here
very
good
winter
beer
had
this
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
very
sweet
but
i
dont
think
excessively
so
given
the
genre
someone
syrupy
but
again
not
overly
so
for
a
warmer
there
was
a
thickness
to
it
as
well
that
was
good
a
good
deal
of
spices
going
into
it
as
well
i
think
harpoon
just
kind
of
went
for
it
with
this
one
and
i
think
it
paid
off
o
not
my
style
too
sweet
but
i
could
see
someone
liking
this
its
not
what
id
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
however
not
thick
enough
and
too
sweet
overall
i
think
ive
said
enough
ill
just
add
that
i
excpected
a
lot
more
from
this
brewery
i
really
enjoyed
this
2013
vintage
i
think
the
bros
need
to
revisit
starts
out
with
a
great
nose
of
cinnamon
and
slight
vanilla
notes
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lacking
but
not
bad
i
may
be
partial
to
winter
style
but
this
is
very
tasty
strong
maltiness
with
a
great
balance
of
spice
and
warmth
enjoyable
o
a
nice
holiday
beer
i
like
it
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
not
my
favorite
special
brew
but
it
was
enjoyable
the
taste
has
a
nice
presence
of
spice
with
a
slight
caramel
and
fruity
yeast
flavor
the
taste
is
very
festive
with
a
warming
go
figure
amount
of
alcohol
yet
pretty
smooth
in
the
middle
with
the
spice
lasting
after
the
swallow
with
some
woody
aspects
of
cinnamon
with
a
nice
spicecake
like
malty
dark
sugar
element
overall
this
is
pretty
great
it
seems
appropriate
as
the
weather
cools
off
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
with
a
hearty
stew
since
the
spice
is
not
too
much
that
it
overwhelms
the
malt
foundation
harpoon
winter
warmer

average
o
not
an
awful
beer
the
taste
itself
is
good
but
they
need
to
take
it
down
a
bit
on
the
cinnamon
and
kick
the
body
up
a
bit
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
but
there
are
better
versions
overall
not
bad
but
not
something
id
ever
buy
ok
this
is
actually
pretty
good
in
its
bones
with
some
real
winter
spices
but
it
is
so
weak
and
watery
that
i
simply
cant
rate
this
highly
o
flat
out
bad
theres
no
excuse
to
spice
a
beer
to
this
effect
no
matter
what
season
it
is
o
fairly
underrated
in
my
book
its
not
great
per
se
nose
notwithstanding
but
i
wouldnt
be
averse
to
having
this
again
in
a
way
im
glad
harpoon
went
for
the
unsubtle
hopdevoid
spice
bomb
route
with
this
instead
of
the
wassail
meets
arrogant
bastard
route
this
is
not
for
everyone
though
t
the
taste
definitely
doesnt
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
smell
a
kind
of
weak
and
watery
spiced
flavor
that
brings
a
touch
of
sourness
some
bread
and
a
touch
of
pecan
pie
an
interesting
warmer
but
probably
not
one
to
revisit
all
in
all
not
bad
especially
in
the
winter
in
ct
its
15f
for
a
high
today
before
the
20
mph
wind
chill
looked
and
smelled
great
tasted
and
felt
soso
if
the
taste
especially
fell
more
in
line
with
the
promise
of
the
aroma
this
would
have
been
a
decent
enough
beer
overall
unfortunately
the
relatively
high
quality
appearance
and
scents
cant
make
up
for
a
rather
dismal
and
disappointing
taste
and
to
me
thats
the
key
component
of
any
beers
appeal
fair
at
best
and
rather
forgettable

with

to

a
fairly
enjoyable
offering
overall
while
the
scores
dont
look
particularly
good
individually
this
beer
isnt
all
that
bad
its
drinkable
and
it
does
have
a
good
flavor
it
just
lacks
in
many
areas
the
smell
and
taste
are
pretty
one
dimensional
and
the
body
is
too
watery
leaving
what
taste
there
is
gone
before
i
can
really
get
into
it
it
has
potential
for
more
if
harpoon
wanted
that
but
as
it
is
one
is
nice
but
there
certainly
wont
be
another
25
very
nice
scent
it
smells
like
a
busy
holiday
party
kitchen
full
of
gingerbread
cookies
and
spice
cake
everything
else
about
it
is
mediocre
though
a
thin
watery
mouth
feel
and
a
fleeting
vaguely
spicysweet
taste
i
would
like
this
beer
if
the
taste
were
stronger
but
it
simply
isnt
oh
well
i
liked
it
but
it
is
not
beer
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
beer
did
not
deliver
on
the
basics
it
pours
a
clear
coppercrimson
color
the
head
is
gone
in
a
flash
leaving
no
lacing
and
no
residual
bubbles
it
smells
of
holidy
spicescinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
and
some
fruity
esters
banana
smells
like
banana
bread
with
extra
spice
the
taste
is
more
or
less
the
same
with
a
slight
acidic
tinge
that
fades
away
to
a
sweet
malty
finish
there
is
a
very
milddry
bitterness
also
present
it
features
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
way
too
much
carbonation
not
my
favorite
overall
the
spice
cake
character
of
this
beer
is
very
well
done
but
that
is
just
about
all
there
is
to
this
beer
i
enjoyed
the
first
few
sips
but
after
a
while
i
became
tired
of
the
sweetness
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
offwhite
head
moderate
to
low
retention
on
a
deep
copper
body
mainly
clear
lacing
aroma
includes
cinnamon
caramel
malts
nougat
and
nutmeg
taste
is
pumkiny
caramel
brown
sugar
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
actually
pretty
tasty
combination
of
flavors
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
i
again
have
had
this
beer
a
time
or
two
sorry
if
my
review
makes
it
seem
like
the
first
time
but
i
wanted
that
insinuation
so
having
bought
it
on
numerous
occasions
i
think
my
tohughts
speak
for
themselves
this
is
the
beer
you
dont
have
to
hoard
or
gloat
about
this
is
not
your
beer
to
sit
and
ponder
and
worship
this
is
your
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
and
socially
an
average
beer
with
just
enough
going
on
for
it
to
raise
it
above
the
competition
o
pretty
well
balanced
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
but
there
is
just
a
little
too
much
cinnamonnutmeg
spiciness
to
this
brew
to
be
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
but
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
want
to
drink
a
couple
of
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
for
me
overall
meh
syrupy
and
sticky
icky
bitterness
dominating
spices
all
wouldnt
be
great
on
their
own
but
together
even
worse
harpoons
winter
warmer
pours
a
fairly
clear
amber
with
some
orange
highlights
showing
through
maybe
two
fingers
of
cream
colored
foam
crown
the
beer
with
just
a
bit
each
of
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
has
a
potent
burst
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
very
pumpkin
pie
like
theres
also
a
biscuity
malt
aroma
present
as
well
the
flavor
profile
isnt
as
robust
especially
when
it
comes
to
the
spicing
theres
a
bit
of
toasty
bread
and
caramel
up
front
followed
by
a
light
balancing
bitterness
the
spices
come
in
for
the
finish
and
theyre
just
not
nearly
as
lively
as
i
would
have
anticipated
given
the
nose
the
body
is
just
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
but
the
carbonation
has
a
good
bit
of
pep
to
it
despite
a
nice
aroma
harpoons
winter
warmer
is
just
a
passable
offering
overall
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
really
a
warmer
it
lacks
the
body
and
feel
as
well
as
abv
to
be
considered
a
winter
warmer
in
my
book
i
would
consider
it
more
a
spiced
ale
not
the
best
but
easy
drinking
and
worth
a
try
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
one
i
will
not
revisit
o
i
bought
this
as
a
one
off
and
i
will
prob
never
try
it
again
o
interesting
and
fun
but
this
is
over
the
top
on
the
spices
for
people
that
really
love
cinnamon
flavors
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
good
beer
i
think
they
could
have
toned
this
down
overall
pretty
enjoyable
beer
not
sure
this
is
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
cinnamon
or
gingersnaps
chances
are
you
will
dig
this
o
if
you
like
spiced
beers
then
this
one
will
fit
your
niche
nicely
otherwise
id
stay
clear
of
this
one
i
enjoy
the
spices
this
time
of
the
year
so
i
am
enjoying
this
one
wouldnt
really
care
for
it
any
other
time
of
the
year
though
again
though
use
discretion
with
purchasing
if
you
dont
like
spiced
brews
surprised
to
see
this
rated
so
low
the
pour
is
clear
dark
copper
in
color
with
a
really
disappointing
white
head
the
nose
is
more
fall
spice
than
winter
with
cinnamon
and
clove
similar
to
a
pumpkin
beer
but
the
flavor
reveals
a
nice
sweet
caramely
malt
profile
which
holds
up
the
spice
well
its
wintery
with
the
spices
loaded
on
the
back
end
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
all
the
way
through
finish
is
really
clean
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
okay
a
little
thin
in
body
i
would
like
this
even
more
with
a
bigger
dose
of
malts
the
carbonation
is
fine
though
and
this
one
is
pretty
easy
drinking
my
problem
with
it
is
the
abv
i
like
to
see
a
bit
stiffer
of
a
winter
warmer
something
to
really
warm
me
and
this
takes
too
many
to
do
that
job
thats
my
most
severe
critique
of
an
otherwise
quite
palatable
brew
a
most
appropriate
beer
to
kick
off
this
holiday
season
would
enjoy
this
more
if
the
temperature
outside
was
about
fifteen
degrees
colder
one
of
my
girlfriends
favorite
winter
seasonals
and
one
of
my
favorite
harpoon
ales
is
a
winter
warmer
under
6
abv
actually
gonna
warm
you
in
any
appreciable
sense
in
any
case
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
ginger
clove
brown
sugar
light
toffee
banana
and
candied
orange
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
focus
heavily
now
on
the
spices
particularly
the
clove
and
brown
sugar
which
end
up
oerwhelming
all
else
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
slick
feel
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
but
a
decidedly
onedimensional
one
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
goes
down
just
fine
poured
a
rubytinged
medium
brown
with
a
miniscule
head
that
dissipated
almost
instantaneously
needless
to
say
no
lacing
strong
smell
of
cinnamon
taste
was
like
a
watered
down
diet
cherry
soda
mouthfeel
was
also
thin
and
sodalike
give
this
one
a
pass
o
this
is
a
solid
winter
beer
however
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
when
choosing
a
beer
of
this
style
originally
reviewed
01162011
o
im
impressed
how
the
spices
held
up
over
time
this
beer
definitely
has
a
winter
spice
taste
to
it
try
it
if
you
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
o
tasty
winter
warmer
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
o
not
a
bad
take
on
the
hearty
spicy
winter
warmer
style
the
only
major
problem
for
me
was
the
pudding
like
feel
overall
all
it
tasted
fine
and
was
par
forth
style
overallthis
beer
is
a
miss
plenty
of
better
options
on
this
style
harpoon
overloaded
it
with
candied
sugar
and
the
mix
doesnt
taste
well
stay
away
12
oz
into
pint
poured
a
deep
dark
copper
with
a
one
finger
head
and
great
retention
on
the
glass
aroma
was
strong
of
the
winter
spices
especially
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
as
well
as
a
slight
citrus
underneath
definitely
warming
but
not
as
much
as
others
in
the
style
having
a
lower
abv
than
i
am
used
to
with
these
the
flavor
was
strong
of
the
cinnamon
up
front
with
a
slight
hop
and
nice
malty
sweetness
at
the
finish
definitely
one
i
will
find
again
next
season
o
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
it
feels
very
empty
and
unsatisfying
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
the
smell
and
flavor
is
exactly
like
others
i
have
had
of
this
style
it
just
seems
a
little
weaker
lots
of
cinnamonish
spices
in
the
flavor
along
with
some
bitter
and
malty
flavors
as
well
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
have
definitely
had
better
ones
in
this
style
o
nothing
special
here
fine
to
try
during
the
season
but
probably
better
on
tap
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
cap
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
love
the
flavor
but
very
unusual
overall
this
beer
is
appropriately
flavored
for
the
winter
season
for
what
it
is
trying
to
be
it
is
actually
very
good
pours
a
dark
brownish
red
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
mostly
nutmeg
with
the
cinnamon
and
malt
present
as
well
taste
follows
with
the
nutmeg
being
the
star
the
flavor
is
not
complex
but
is
nice
the
flavors
are
not
too
overpowering
this
one
wont
get
annoying
after
a
few
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
could
have
had
more
depth
overall
a
good
winter
warmer
decent
flavors
a
better
mix
a
flavor
could
put
this
over
the
top
in
the
derby
for
bad
beer
from
the
most
overhyped
eastcast
brewer
until
now
i
held
that
any
brew
from
sam
adams
would
by
default
take
the
trophy
now
i
stand
corrected
boston
brewing
must
now
share
said
trophy
with
harpoon
this
winter
warmer
ranks
among
the
flattest
flavorless
most
aromaless
beer
on
todays
market
and
its
a
fine
addition
to
all
of
the
other
flavorless
aromaless
beer
that
harpoon
brews
the
only
thing
separating
this
beer
from
a
glass
of
water
is
the
price
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
compared
to
others
in
the
style
but
could
use
more
complexity
and
fullerbodied
nature
to
make
it
more
of
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
while
sipped
this
was
my
first
winter
warmer
years
ago
when
i
was
living
in
boston
i
remember
it
being
fantastic
maybe
ive
become
more
snobbish
but
i
find
it
to
be
rather
simple
and
a
little
unrefined
now
its
still
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
its
somehow
now
one
dimensional
and
a
little
forgettable
for
me
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
minimal
along
with
the
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
spicy
notes
on
the
nose
along
with
some
sweet
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
reminded
me
too
much
a
pumpkin
ale
i
felt
that
their
spice
choice
might
have
been
a
little
off
here
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
bad
but
still
pretty
average
overall
this
isnt
something
id
go
oout
of
my
way
to
have
again
there
are
some
better
choices
out
there
in
my
opinion
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
pale
clear
copper
coloring
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
is
very
low
profile
slight
cling
to
the
glass
as
the
beer
moves
around
a
muddled
aroma
of
spices
with
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
allspice
on
the
nose
and
a
slight
caramel
malt
in
the
background
the
flavors
are
a
burnt
malt
sweetness
with
only
a
little
bit
of
the
spicing
coming
through
and
an
awkward
hopping
the
flavors
end
up
a
bit
jumbled
and
overly
sweet
to
the
point
of
tangy
the
beer
is
a
little
light
bodied
for
the
style
and
it
leaves
a
slick
oily
finish
there
is
a
tangy
caramel
aftertaste
that
hangs
on
the
palate
almost
to
the
point
of
becoming
sour
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
nor
from
harpoon
not
the
boldest
of
winter
warmers
but
still
satisfying
this
beer
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
each
winter
kind
of
a
shallow
winter
warmer
it
has
some
nice
spice
notes
but
not
much
of
a
malt
body
i
dont
really
dig
the
amber
base
o
when
i
think
of
a
beer
that
is
perfect
for
christmas
all
around
i
think
of
harpoon
winter
warmer
it
is
impressive
that
you
can
make
a
beer
that
tastes
and
smells
so
much
like
the
holidays
and
since
it
is
not
very
heavy
it
is
fine
for
family
members
who
are
not
accustomed
to
drinking
heavytasteful
beers
overall
this
beer
isnt
great
for
the
style
i
would
like
it
to
warm
me
a
bit
when
i
drink
some
i
used
to
love
to
have
this
every
time
the
holidays
roll
around
but
weve
grown
apart
a
little
bit
on
tap
at
the
office
pours
dark
amber
hue
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
of
cinnamon
cloves
some
caramel
and
peppery
hops
medium
smooth
body
taste
is
of
cinnamon
cloves
some
caramel
cherry
fruit
and
peppery
hops
nice
holyday
brew
overall
its
not
bad
id
probably
pick
it
up
again
when
i
want
something
winterstyle
that
isnt
super
heavy
or
overbearing
with
its
flavor
o
overall
a
nice
offering
from
harpoon
smooth
and
silky
great
taste
could
definitely
be
better
though
o
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
i
prefer
the
more
robust
warmers
than
the
spiced
ones
oi
thought
harpoon
really
doesnt
make
anything
bad
ill
give
it
a
go
on
a
single
for
cheap
poor
choice
almost
like
they
left
an
overly
spiced
pumpkin
ale
sit
and
go
bad
not
that
good
of
a
beer
would
not
go
near
again
overall
too
much
spicing
especially
the
nutmeg
d
this
is
a
lot
like
the
overspiced
pumpkin
beers
that
are
made
by
most
breweries
but
with
even
less
complexity
and
really
just
one
note
of
cinnamon
theres
nothing
to
hate
but
unless
youre
a
big
cinnamon
person
stay
away
made
me
crave
stegmeier
winter
warmer
for
all
the
things
that
this
one
was
not
overall
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
for
years
not
to
bad
but
can
only
have
a
few
due
to
getting
full
over
the
course
of
a
night
still
a
nice
beer
that
warms
you
up
like
the
name
applies
pours
a
dark
amber
color
off
white
head
and
little
retention
spice
rack
aroma
of
cinnamon
all
spice
nutmeg
and
clove
in
the
taste
lots
of
spice
ranging
from
dry
nutmeg
pepper
cinnamon
and
clove
astringent
bitterness
and
lingering
spice
embedding
itself
in
the
palatte
malt
body
is
slightly
sweet
and
almost
tangy
mouthfeel
is
dominated
by
a
wave
of
spices
on
a
chewy
medium
bodied
brew
overall
if
you
really
love
highly
spiced
beer
this
fits
the
bill
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
all
30
or
so
winter
beers
that
ive
tried
so
far
pours
a
leathertan
color
with
a
good
amount
of
foam
they
promise
cinnamon
on
the
bottle
and
boy
does
this
brew
have
it
cinnamon
aromas
balanced
by
some
nutmeg
allspice
and
a
nice
sweetness
come
through
when
smelled
the
cinnamon
takes
center
stage
flavorwise
but
its
braced
by
a
pleasing
thick
malt
backbone
some
harshness
around
the
edges
warms
well
true
to
its
name
just
not
very
exciting
or
interesting
overall
i
guess
the
beer
is
exactly
as
you
would
expect
it
to
be
reading
from
the
label
but
this
just
isnt
my
style
of
my
beer
fairly
average
winter
warmer
grab
one
if
you
like
lots
of
spice
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
lacks
the
full
body
and
warming
quality
that
i
enjoy
in
a
winter
warmer
glad
i
scored
this
in
a
case
swap
and
didnt
purchase
an
entire
case
poured
a
1
5
light
custard
head
clear
body
but
deep
amber
in
color
smell
is
light
but
has
malt
as
well
as
the
promised
cinnamin
and
nutmeg
taste
mirrors
the
smell
body
is
creamy
though
mediumlight
weight
finish
is
very
subtle
but
has
a
good
lifespan
although
not
beyond
average
i
dont
understand
they
anyone
would
hate
this
beer
to
score
it
below
average
d
this
beer
is
not
a
standout
for
harpoon
and
certainly
one
to
avoid
if
you
do
not
already
like
this
style
much
the
spices
should
be
tweaked
and
in
my
opinion
this
beer
tasted
a
bit
better
as
it
warmed
o
a
decent
winter
warmer
nothing
spectacular
but
would
have
it
again
o
nothing
about
this
sticks
out
as
bad
its
just
not
good
too
mild
and
watery
no
warmth
overall
this
a
decent
winter
warmer
nothing
spectacular
but
certainly
not
terrible
i
wont
turn
one
down
of
its
offered
to
me
thats
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
and
very
drying
the
drinkability
is
a
bit
below
average
the
high
spicing
wears
a
bit
against
this
overall
this
is
an
average
brew
its
interesting
enough
to
keep
drinking
but
not
good
enough
to
really
want
to
see
again
funnily
enough
i
let
my
roommate
have
a
sip
of
this
after
he
pulled
a
harpoon
oktoberfest
out
of
the
fridge
and
he
said
that
its
good
actually
really
fucking
good
thats
beer
for
you
guess
the
second
one
out
of
this
winter
sampler
can
be
his
o
a
definite
pass
probably
wont
buy
again
overall
i
assume
something
is
amiss
with
this
beer
since
reviews
dont
like
its
really
not
that
palatable
pass
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
by
date
of
21512
this
pours
a
nice
brown
ale
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
the
smells
are
very
good
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
maybe
banana
the
feel
is
medium
with
decent
carbonation
the
taste
is
a
major
disappointment
a
little
of
the
spices
but
mostly
an
odd
bitterness
not
a
hop
bitterness
which
would
be
good
and
its
mostly
light
i
didnt
expect
this
opinion
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
hope
that
my
wife
likes
it
as
i
am
not
a
real
big
fan
of
spiced
beers
and
this
one
is
obviously
spiced
it
is
still
drinkable
and
if
you
like
spiced
beers
it
really
isnt
too
bad
once
i
get
through
this
sixpack
i
doubt
that
i
will
ever
need
to
come
back
to
this
one
overall
i
actually
liked
this
one
its
right
on
that
edge
of
using
too
much
spice
and
going
way
out
of
balance
but
i
thought
it
stayed
within
the
margins
perhaps
not
as
traditional
as
the
typical
winter
warmer
but
not
too
bad
overalli
enjoyed
this
beer
im
looking
forward
to
grabbing
a
sixer
when
the
2011
comes
out
unfortunately
such
an
aftertaste
doesnt
prove
as
wanted
as
might
be
expected
instead
leaving
a
slightly
stale
earthy
flavor
on
the
tongueas
if
id
eaten
a
quarter
teaspoon
of
mixed
and
dried
nutmeg
and
cloves
but
didnt
have
a
glass
of
water
to
wash
it
down
which
is
a
pity
since
the
ale
had
been
rather
nice
up
to
that
point
but
damn
its
like
eatingdrinking
the
decorative
placement
at
thanksgivingchristmas
so
dang
overwhelming
its
like
take
anchor
christmas
and
increase
it
tenfold
no
subtlety
totally
dominates
what
appears
to
be
a
thin
base
they
just
dumped
the
adjuncts
not
necessarily
cheap
adjuncts
by
the
truck
into
this
one
if
only
the
malt
bill
were
higher
the
spicecinnamon
might
not
be
so
dreadful
but
with
nothing
to
counterbalance
it
your
mouth
feels
like
someone
put
cinnamon
and
holley
in
your
mouth
i
like
a
good
spicy
winter
warmer
but
this
is
just
a
little
too
thin
compared
to
other
beers
of
the
style
that
are
more
pronounced
i
like
a
winter
warmer
to
be
bursting
with
flavor
and
while
this
does
have
alot
of
flavor
its
thinned
out
a
bit
in
the
body
but
still
drinkable
overall
overall
overall
the
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
smell
and
appearance
were
good
and
then
the
flavor
had
too
many
spicy
cinnaomny
notes
for
me
the
strange
aftertaste
and
combination
of
spices
turned
me
off
to
this
beer
i
could
not
finish
the
bottle
i
would
imagine
a
few
of
these
would
leave
one
feeling
a
bit
iffy
due
to
the
over
the
top
sweetness
and
flavor
profile
d
pretty
drinkable
however
the
spices
really
dominate
i
like
the
idea
of
cinnamon
in
the
beer
but
in
this
case
it
just
takes
over
the
other
flavors
completely
doverly
spiced
and
definitely
some
left
over
sugars
hanging
around
complexity
and
subtly
completely
lost
here
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
the
spices
were
just
way
to
overpowering
and
they
didnt
let
any
other
flavors
or
aromas
come
through
there
was
just
no
balance
to
this
beer
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
needed
this
was
my
first
harpoon
brew
and
i
was
pretty
disappointed
but
i
am
still
down
to
try
other
beers
from
them
just
not
their
winter
warmer
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
and
i
dont
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
respects
their
taste
buds
in
the
end
there
was
really
no
saving
grace
for
this
beer
it
didnt
have
any
kind
of
convincing
flavor
to
it
at
the
same
time
the
mishmash
of
flavors
it
did
have
totally
covered
up
everything
that
is
enjoyable
about
beer
in
the
first
place
d
it
tastes
like
a
delicious
fall
or
early
winter
dessert
my
expectations
first
drinking
this
beer
were
non
existent
i
knew
nothing
about
it
and
a
friend
offered
it
i
poured
a
pint
of
it
and
thought
it
was
fantastic
i
have
and
will
once
again
purchase
this
beer
harpoon
stayed
true
to
the
winter
warmer
style
with
much
spices
added
to
this
beer
it
poured
a
very
clear
honey
color
aromas
of
mostly
cinnamon
some
nutmeg
and
baked
apples
came
about
upon
first
smell
the
taste
was
overpoweringly
cinnamon
which
produced
a
slight
heat
on
my
taste
buds
this
did
not
leave
too
much
room
for
any
other
flavor
besides
a
little
hop
bitterness
to
even
things
out
a
little
this
brew
is
definitely
for
cinnamon
lovers
and
spice
addicts
with
a
little
cold
weather
drinkability
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
but
not
bad
either
a
bit
strong
with
the
cinnamon
if
you
ask
me
im
a
little
surprised
at
the
overall
average
of
reviews
my
wife
and
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
on
tap
in
nyc
a
few
years
back
it
we
were
blown
away
its
litterally
christmas
in
a
glass
we
look
forward
to
every
winter
to
get
this
its
surprisingly
dark
great
spice
good
mouthfeel
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
and
am
partial
to
sweeter
beers
so
maybe
that
why
i
enjoy
this
more
than
some
i
can
usually
handle
up
to
3
before
needing
something
less
sweet
either
way
a
delicious
beer
i
will
enjoy
each
winter
d
incredibly
drinkable
even
my
girlfriend
who
doesnt
like
beer
could
stand
this
however
that
being
said
it
has
nothing
much
to
save
it
from
being
bland
either
drinkability
the
taste
is
not
horrible
and
will
certainly
leave
you
feeling
warm
and
comfortable
inside
overall
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
best
to
enjoy
one
or
two
when
relaxing
on
a
cold
night
makes
me
feel
festive
very
easy
to
kick
back
a
few
of
these
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
but
if
offered
i
owuldnt
refuse
overall
kind
of
a
mellow
winter
warmer
but
i
bet
this
was
top
notch
back
in
1988
verdict
i
do
not
recommand
this
beer
at
all
i
honestly
dont
understand
what
the
brewer
had
in
mind
although
i
found
a
potential
use
to
it
it
could
be
good
for
marinating
meat
in
order
to
make
a
meatpie
for
christmas
next
year
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
of
this
next
christmas
d
not
your
usual
hefty
heavy
spiced
seasonal
it
has
some
of
the
expected
notes
spices
and
toasty
caramelly
malts
but
it
is
done
in
a
refreshing
manner
probably
better
with
food
than
as
a
stand
alone
as
a
session
beer
the
spice
load
start
to
hurt
it
despite
the
relatively
modest
abv
nice
enough
for
what
it
is
though
verdict
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
also
didnt
love
it
it
seemed
like
a
bunch
of
spices
were
just
poured
into
a
vat
and
mixed
together
with
eggnog
a
decent
holiday
drink
but
dont
expect
a
beer
out
of
this
one
i
am
not
sure
that
ive
had
a
beer
this
bad
before
this
is
actually
just
offensive
for
me
to
drink
maybe
i
had
a
bad
sample
but
the
aftertaste
and
finishing
this
one
of
one
of
the
more
difficult
things
to
do
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
its
not
filling
and
would
be
a
nice
introductory
christmas
beer
its
ok
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
i
do
like
the
fact
that
its
not
over
run
with
over
the
top
spices
and
flavors
as
so
many
winter
seasonals
can
be
just
an
easy
going
beer
overall
this
palate
has
medium
carbonation
and
a
thin
watery
palate
that
doesnt
fit
the
style
very
well
very
well
carbonated
and
leaves
a
spicy
after
taste
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
overall
is
a
very
good
winter
beer
note
i
just
wanted
to
note
that
i
remember
having
this
beer
a
couple
years
ago
2007
and
thinking
it
was
terrible
either
my
tastes
have
changed
or
the
recipe
did
either
way
i
am
happy
with
it
my
overly
aggressive
pour
not
only
caused
a
wee
bit
of
spillover
but
also
netted
me
two
fingers
worth
of
lighttan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
solid
copper
no
amber
at
all
with
nequality
clarity
beautiful
nose
had
notes
of
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
suddenly
i
was
hungry
for
some
freshbaked
gingerbread
cookies
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
nice
spiciness
on
the
tongue
it
reminded
me
of
making
cookies
and
baking
bread
with
my
maternal
grandmother
when
i
was
just
a
lad
lovely
sticky
lacing
began
to
appear
as
the
liquid
level
decreased
in
my
glass
finish
allowed
the
cinnamon
to
really
shine
and
it
lingered
well
after
the
initial
swallow
this
was
great
on
this
cold
day
with
intermittent
flurries
in
fact
the
spices
are
so
overbearing
that
you
wont
even
notice
that
theres
any
alcohol
in
this
like
your
aunts
fruitcake
that
sits
in
the
fridge
waiting
to
be
given
away
this
may
take
space
in
your
stash
of
beer
until
its
just
time
to
get
rid
of
it
its
not
a
drain
pour
but
unless
youre
a
diehard
fan
of
this
style
youll
say
you
shouldnt
have
no
really
when
someone
gives
this
to
you
theres
nothing
like
this
on
the
market
and
its
worth
a
try
once
but
only
because
words
cannot
fully
do
this
justice
to
talk
about
a
beer
like
this
requires
knowledge
patience
and
bravado
thankfully
i
only
bought
one
bottle
so
there
wont
be
any
need
for
me
to
repackage
it
and
pass
it
off
to
anyone
else
who
has
yet
to
experience
the
surprise
lurking
once
the
cap
is
off
d
drinkability
would
be
higher
if
it
wasnt
for
all
the
spice
this
beer
finished
off
a
sixer
over
about
two
months
so
clearly
not
a
fast
drinker
haha
a
surprising
overall
favorite
of
my
beer
evaluation
sessions
focusing
on
winterchristmas
brews
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
dimpled
mug
pours
an
amber
body
with
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
rim
of
froth
strong
nasal
essence
of
cinnamon
and
other
zesty
spices
some
of
the
spices
remain
in
the
flavor
but
the
body
which
is
surprisingly
watery
threw
me
for
a
loop
this
could
be
a
better
brew
if
the
body
was
beefed
up
a
bit
flavors
include
orange
peel
nutmeg
more
cinnamon
allspice
gingerbread
and
subtle
firewood
thin
body
and
softmedium
carbonation
again
for
a
winter
warmer
this
brew
definitely
needs
some
more
body
d
this
turned
out
to
be
a
surprise
most
pleasant
i
usually
try
not
to
but
i
had
read
the
reviews
before
i
bought
it
i
enjoyed
this
one
however
and
might
have
to
pick
up
a
few
more
before
they
disappear
overall
this
beer
could
be
fantastic
if
it
could
control
some
of
its
spicy
characteristics
it
has
a
nice
nose
and
some
great
initial
flavor
but
the
heavy
spice
disrupts
the
balance
of
the
beer
the
rest
body
is
thin
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
soso
the
gingerbread
tastearoma
really
dominates
but
then
the
finishes
pretty
weak
not
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
ever
had
light
bodied
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
average
carbonation
goes
down
easy
enough
but
the
spices
wear
on
you
making
this
one
not
tremendously
drinkable
this
beer
looks
good
a
nice
clean
clear
caramel
colored
beer
with
a
nice
head
good
retention
and
a
nice
head
an
overly
spiced
aroma
the
beer
is
even
more
overly
spiced
in
a
gross
way
to
much
xmas
spices
slightly
chewy
just
not
good
bad
mouthfeel
i
cant
drink
this
this
is
moderately
drinkable
though
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
due
to
its
below
par
taste
you
mileage
might
vary
but
if
you
like
cinnamon
and
dont
mind
it
being
the
star
of
the
show
this
beer
is
for
you
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
more
than
worth
a
try
delicious
d
not
that
bad
but
i
dont
find
myself
wanting
more
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
d
the
spices
are
just
to
much
to
drink
many
of
these
the
two
from
the
winter
pack
will
be
enough
for
me
im
a
big
harpoon
fan
i
just
think
they
could
have
done
a
bit
better
ra
pours
the
color
of
a
new
copper
penny
almost
no
head
scent
is
a
big
whiff
of
seasonal
spices
lead
by
cinamin
then
less
amunts
of
nutmeg
ginger
and
clove
very
lightly
sweet
carmely
malt
profile
taste
again
is
big
on
the
seasonal
spices
decently
belnded
all
be
it
a
tad
strong
compared
to
the
very
light
background
notes
of
carmel
malts
the
beer
feels
quite
light
on
the
tongue
some
linger
spice
notes
the
overall
reviews
of
this
beer
shocked
me
as
ive
had
a
few
of
these
lately
and
have
enjoyed
it
it
is
high
on
the
spice
and
light
on
a
lot
of
things
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
redorange
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
clove
and
cinnamon
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
clove
coriander
cinnamon
and
a
hint
of
candy
cane
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
it
had
a
nice
touch
with
the
candy
cane
flavor
and
spices
well
balanced
and
nicely
done
on
the
flavor
saw
that
a
lot
of
people
are
completely
bashing
this
one
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
that
bad
not
great
but
not
bad
d
im
not
impressed
i
dont
think
i
will
finish
this
yup
going
down
the
drain
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
caramel
and
toffee
malt
along
with
some
assorted
spices
i
get
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
spicy
along
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
the
spices
taste
a
bit
muddled
and
are
tough
to
pick
out
individual
ones
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
decent
winter
warmer
but
there
are
better
spiced
christmas
beers
out
there
this
is
the
worst
winter
offering
ive
had
definitely
not
something
id
seek
out
again
i
have
had
much
better
winter
ales
i
would
avoid
unless
you
were
offered
by
a
guest
not
the
greatest
ive
had
this
season
the
spicing
seemed
overly
contrived
and
as
i
mentioned
not
very
well
balanced
just
a
mouthful
of
spice
giving
way
to
a
weak
malty
backbone
d
nicely
balanced
winter
warmer
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
overly
sweet
there
are
way
better
christmas
ales
out
there
cheers
pours
a
mirkly
dark
amber
with
a
quick
dissipating
head
into
a
pint
glass
smells
like
bananas
and
pine
strong
taste
of
banana
almost
overwhelming
in
fact
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
from
harpoon
thus
far
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
it
does
goes
down
quite
smooth
i
will
give
it
that
d
the
funny
dryness
to
it
doesnt
make
it
terribly
drinkable
but
its
pretty
smooth
drinkability
i
honestly
dont
know
why
there
is
no
much
hatred
for
this
beer
its
not
that
bad
at
all
i
went
into
this
review
concerned
but
i
really
dont
mind
it
at
all
and
would
definitely
pick
it
up
again
i
do
however
note
that
its
best
when
cold
right
out
of
the
fridge
and
it
loses
some
of
its
charm
as
it
warms
up
i
think
though
i
like
this
beer
because
i
really
like
cinnamon
which
is
the
dominant
flavor
in
this
beer
its
a
little
bit
like
having
a
beery
redhot
those
little
red
candies
so
if
you
dont
like
this
spice
then
youre
going
to
hate
this
beer
despite
this
love
of
cinnamon
it
is
a
beer
that
i
can
only
have
one
of
while
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
another
night
i
cant
have
more
than
one
in
an
evening
while
i
really
love
cinnamon
its
a
spice
to
flavor
other
things
not
to
have
solely
by
itself
overall
this
is
a
decent
winter
offering
i
enjoyed
this
more
during
my
novice
beer
days
now
it
is
kinda
heavy
on
the
spices
enjoyable
once
or
twice
during
the
winter
months
but
not
a
whole
6pack
beer
if
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
were
reversed
with
more
hopymalty
qualities
up
front
and
the
spices
more
towards
the
back
then
this
beer
would
have
done
a
lot
better
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
solid
retention
and
lacing
very
spicy
aroma
allspice
and
cinnamon
mostly
flavor
is
a
little
more
subdued
but
same
as
the
aroma
little
malt
or
hops
mostly
just
light
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
flavor
d
medium
to
low
not
sure
how
much
id
like
the
strong
spices
d
wow
looks
like
people
really
dont
like
this
beer
i
dont
think
its
that
bad
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
1
but
its
something
differentintresting
and
the
1
i
drank
went
down
pretty
decent
d
a
nice
brew
but
not
a
heavy
hitting
winter
warmer
an
average
at
best
brew
that
has
good
flavors
but
does
not
have
me
coming
back
for
more
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
and
do
look
forward
to
any
release
from
harpoon
this
was
served
from
a
bottle
in
to
a
sam
adams
glass
the
appearance
is
copper
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
to
some
lacing
smells
and
tastes
like
cinnamon
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
it
but
i
would
take
one
if
it
was
offered
drinkability
not
a
chance
getting
through
one
of
these
took
me
a
couple
of
hours
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
do
with
the
rest
of
them
perhaps
use
them
in
a
holiday
stew
or
something
a
pity
as
harpoon
produces
some
decent
stuff
im
not
sure
what
they
were
thinking
with
this
one
im
not
sure
i
wouldnt
know
this
wasnt
a
strong
pumpkin
beer
if
i
didnt
know
better
it
is
pretty
one
dimensional
and
not
all
that
good
the
spices
seem
to
be
overdone
and
there
isnt
really
any
malt
character
it
is
basically
a
macro
base
with
a
ton
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
thrown
in
2
5
d
not
terrible
but
pretty
boring
this
could
benefit
from
a
higher
mash
temp
more
specialty
malts
and
more
enthusiasm

with
a
trace
of
nutmeg
and

taste
follows
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
light
cinnamon

that
also
expresses
itself
in
the
flavor
profile
however
its
all
a
bit
watered
down
mouthfeel

light
in

and
somewhat
watery

carbonation

somewhat
lively
and
even
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
fortunately
it
lacks
the
cloying
spiciness
you
tend
to
find
in
the
style
but
theres
also
nothing
too
special
about
it
either
it
improves

average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
this
beer
has
a
light
feel
to
it
and
goes
down
well
it
has
some
nice
spices
in
it
that
would
compliment
the
type
of
foods
that
would
be
common
during
the
holidays
and
the
colder
months
it
also
is
pretty
refreshing
and
pretty
drinkable
as
well
d
as
soon
as
i
cracked
this
open
and
took
a
sip
i
was
totally
disappointed
and
thought
what
a
waste
of
money
this
is
fine
for
bmc
drinkers
trying
to
break
out
of
the
box
but
most
ba
fans
will
hate
this
i
think
they
overdid
it
with
the
flavors
bigtime
d
i
will
probably
never
buy
this
beer
again
i
can
not
imagine
drinking
more
than
1
of
these
per
session
i
have
some
in
the
fridge
and
they
do
not
leave
me
craving
more
after
i
have
1
not
that
bad
but
the
spices
feel
a
little
overwhelming
and
the
malt
sweetness
seems
a
little
cloying
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
this
one
up
again
but
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
d
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
another
12
pack
of
this
stuff
d
if
they
would
have
eased
up
on
the
nutmeg
i
think
this
one
would
be
a
yummy
one
keep
brewing
gentlemen
easy
enough
to
drink
if
the
spicy
sweetness
is
not
too
much
for
you
drinkability
the
taste
is
too
much
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
though
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
of
winter
brew
i
prefer
the
stouts
but
as
far
as
winter
warmers
go
its
not
a
bad
run
in
all
honesty
the
beer
feels
like
it
could
be
really
good
but
there
are
too
many
drawbacks
at
the
moment
d
goes
down
good
a
little
spicy
but
still
drinkable
for
seasonal
it
is
ok
to
embrace
for
the
season
d
more
than
one
might
just
cause
a
stomach
ache
due
to
candylike
cinnamon
other
spices
ive
had
better
holiday
brews
and
due
to
the
lack
of
balance
overwhelming
sweetness
and
cinnamon
candy
taste
i
cant
recommend
it
a
very
good
beer
for
the
upcoming
christmas
season
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
moderate
rustyred
color
with
a
slight
head
and
some
pretty
good
lacing
the
nose
is
overloaded
with
spicescinnamon
clove
nutmeg
and
a
hint
of
ginger
the
taste
is
the
same
way
with
some
very
mild
malt
in
the
background
the
feel
and
the
drinkability
both
suffer
from
the
fact
that
this
is
just
a
spice
bomb
and
i
cant
handle
too
much
of
it
better
if
you
drink
it
ice
cold
it
does
leave
you
with
a
slight
bittering
and
dry
mouthfeel
but
its
one
of
those
beers
that
i
couldnt
sit
down
and
drink
more
than
one
just
because
of
the
overwhelming
spice
characteristics
deep
red
to
brown
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
pours
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
reduces
to
a
decent
white
cap
ripe
apple
cinnamon
and
coriander
aromas
surprisingly
thin
bodied
given
the
deep
color
and
thick
head
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
light
apple
and
pear
flavors
in
the
beginning
that
lead
to
a
dominant
coriander
spice
middle
with
a
hint
of
orange
rind
lingering
spice
aftertaste
this
was
generally
disappointing
after
the
pour
and
first
nose
full
it
all
just
kind
of
went
down
hill
deep
copper
with
a
head
reminiscent
of
egg
nog
in
color
and
look
except
the
bubbles
it
smells
of
nutmeg
but
not
nearly
as
strong
in
spices
as
last
years
offering
for
the
record
this
is
the
2010
edition
this
does
taste
better
than
2009s
release
but
that
doesnt
say
much
this
one
is
substandard
as
well
the
phenols
in
the
mouthfeel
overwhelm
any
good
tastes
and
make
this
not
all
that
pleasant
to
drink
if
you
can
ignore
the
phenols
the
astringency
that
attacks
the
roof
and
back
and
sides
of
your
mouth
you
can
sense
the
caramel
malts
in
the
back
and
the
spices
nutmeg
and
clove
its
a
shame
that
the
control
over
the
way
the
spices
interacted
in
the
final
product
was
not
firmly
in
place
this
had
the
potential
to
be
a
really
nice
beer
clear
coppery
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
cap
of
fine
bubbles
a
few
tiny
spots
of
lace
intense
spice
aroma
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
faint
malt
the
flavour
was
alright
it
improved
as
it
warmed
at
first
the
spices
were
dominant
and
didnt
leave
much
room
for
the
malt
sweetness
and
caramel
that
were
present
in
the
background
once
closer
to
room
temp
the
malt
presence
improved
and
provided
some
needed
balance
spices
still
lingered
on
my
palate
a
little
longer
than
i
would
have
liked
decent
texture
medium
bodied
if
the
spicing
were
pulled
back
a
bit
id
enjoy
it
a
lot
more
first
winter
warmer
of
the
season
pours
a
very
copper
brown
color
into
the
glass
with
a
slightly
tan
head
that
dissipated
rapidly
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
a
spice
bomb
with
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
not
really
getting
anything
else
in
the
smell
taste
follows
in
line
with
smell
really
not
picking
up
on
anything
else
but
a
weak
cinnamon
taste
there
are
other
spices
in
the
background
but
it
just
seems
a
jumbled
secondary
mess
cant
really
discern
any
other
flavor
slight
caramel
malt
but
thats
it
mouthfeel
is
where
this
beer
really
falls
apart
for
me
its
just
too
thin
and
watery
for
a
winter
warmer
in
fact
i
get
a
better
more
solid
feel
out
of
summer
beers
i
like
i
was
really
surprised
at
the
lack
of
body
in
this
seasonal
beer
im
disappointed
i
picked
up
a
6er
of
this
novfeb
im
just
looking
for
beers
with
more
oomph
overall
i
would
describe
this
beer
as
unremarkable
but
comforting
in
a
good
way
this
is
what
i
want
to
be
drinking
at
a
family
holiday
dinner
or
sitting
on
my
couch
in
november
watching
football
dthe
look
and
smell
of
this
beer
led
to
the
extreme
let
down
of
drinking
it
i
wish
i
had
not
bought
a
sixer
d
i
really
like
this
beer
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
it
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
winter
warmers
i
have
had
it
doesnt
compare
in
this
style
i
woud
give
it
more
of
a
pumpkin
style
than
anything
else
it
is
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
every
wintertime
one
is
fine
however
two
seems
as
if
it
could
be
one
too
many
definitely
not
a
session
beer
which
i
doubt
it
was
made
to
be
either
way
it
is
a
solid
reminder
of
the
holidays
to
come
and
pumpkin
pie
and
sweet
potatoes
to
be
eaten
if
you
want
a
beer
to
drink
by
a
wood
stove
when
you
are
wearing
flannel
and
down
this
is
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
colour
with
a
nice
white
head
great
retention
and
minimal
lacing
smell
has
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
taste
is
quite
spicy
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
im
not
sure
if
im
just
overrating
because
a
lack
of
winterxmas
beers
lately
but
im
digging
this
nice
carbonation
level
glad
i
have
another
bottle
in
the
fridge
because
id
like
another
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
either
i
think
they
must
have
improved
this
beer
a
good
bit
since
the
bros
reviewed
it
its
certainly
better
than
a
d
beer
in
my
opinion
but
hey
its
not
perfect
either
there
is
an
overly
watery
mouthfeel
to
the
beer
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
essence
of
beer
it
is
almost
as
if
the
soul
were
stolen
from
this
beer
it
tastes
ok
but
only
if
you
do
not
think
of
it
as
beer
winter
warmer
like
flavors
and
spices
just
not
very
beer
like
there
is
a
slightly
medicinal
taste
due
to
overspicing
and
not
enough
malt
flavors
ive
enjoyed
other
beers
from
harpoon
but
this
one
is
a
one
trick
pony
that
is
not
impressive
the
spice
blend
is
awful
and
thats
all
there
is
to
this
beer
i
wont
drink
this
again
attractive
looking
beer
with
a
clear
dark
amber
color
a
large
offwhite
head
forms
and
has
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
a
fairly
large
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
smells
sorta
like
my
mothers
gingerbread
cookies
she
made
me
when
i
was
a
kid
not
much
for
beer
elements
however
just
a
lot
of
cinammon
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
too
far
overthetop
with
spice
not
very
enjoyable
the
first
sip
was
okay
but
it
just
built
up
to
unlikable
levels
if
some
beer
could
actually
be
tasted
this
could
be
a
decent
beer
too
light
in
body
and
overcarbonated
does
not
help
the
flavor
at
all
might
pass
as
some
oddball
beer
to
pass
off
as
a
surprise
to
some
unsuspecting
guest
but
i
would
not
drink
it
again
my
take
on
this
beer
is
that
it
is
like
drinking
a
spiced
newcastle
brown
ale
the
light
brown
ale
part
was
ok
not
great
but
was
ok
the
spicing
part
was
ok
but
when
you
put
these
two
things
together
that
dont
really
go
together
you
get
something
not
really
desirable
pours
a
clear
copper
color
nicely
complex
smell
of
warm
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
plus
sweet
caramel
taste
is
similar
was
very
surprised
to
see
all
the
bad
reviews
as
i
like
this
taste
quite
a
bit
crisp
clean
feel
could
drink
a
couple
but
not
more
than
that
with
the
spicy
taste
drinkwont
be
getting
this
again
d
well
after
just
having
the
respected
dark
munich
from
harpoon
this
was
a
let
down
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
now
would
i
seek
it
out
1
is
enough
please
try
again
next
year
drinkability
not
really
what
im
looking
for
in
a
winter
warmer
but
this
is
very
good
and
i
will
definately
try
it
more
next
year
i
can
get
through
one
of
anything
this
is
absolutely
the
worst
offering
from
harpoon
ive
ever
had
i
just
think
this
one
missed
the
mark
big
time
drinkability
smooth
and
drinkable
surprisingly
drinkable
i
was
expecting
overpowering
spice
that
would
limit
the
amount
you
could
enjoy
over
a
night
but
thats
not
the
case
with
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thin
bodied
i
would
really
like
to
see
harpoon
beef
this
one
up
and
give
it
more
body
use
natural
spices
as
an
undertone
to
enhance
the
beer
flavor
rather
than
dominate
it
they
must
sell
alot
of
it
to
keep
brewing
this
year
after
year
if
they
go
by
the
ba
rating
it
would
probably
be
booted
from
the
line
up
or
at
least
get
a
recipe
overhaul
i
dont
hate
it
but
i
dont
love
it
either
poured
a
rich
coffee
like
color
with
okay
head
but
little
lacing
and
leaves
quickly
the
smell
comes
off
a
bit
assaulting
to
me
almost
reminiscent
of
malt
extract
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
along
the
lines
of
brooklyns
winter
ale
and
these
sweet
spicy
caramel
brews
arent
my
forte
id
like
less
cloying
sweetness
and
more
hops
i
usually
like
harpoon
brews
but
this
was
a
let
down
for
sure
this
beer
has
a
very
strong
smell
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
which
makes
it
smell
like
a
candy
with
artificial
banana
flavoring
the
beer
has
a
sweet
taste
that
isnt
very
beer
like
this
came
in
a
winter
variety
pack
and
although
i
though
it
was
alright
it
is
certainly
not
a
beer
you
are
going
to
want
to
drink
often
medium
mouthfeel
thats
too
heavy
for
sessioning
but
light
enough
to
down
23
in
1
sitting
i
am
a
big
harpoon
fan
but
this
one
is
a
miss
for
me
i
dont
like
the
spices
takes
away
from
the
beer
there
is
no
real
taste
to
the
beer
that
resembles
beer
hops
barley
if
i
am
drinking
a
beer
i
want
it
to
taste
like
a
beer
and
then
they
can
mix
in
whatever
but
this
is
just
too
overdone
for
me
maybe
having
one
at
a
party
for
a
novelty
but
id
rather
have
an
eggnog
better
on
tap
than
in
bottle
overall
this
is
beer
is
terrible
way
to
much
spice
and
not
drinkable
at
all
poured
from
the
tap
into
a
tall
glass
during
valentines
dinner
thin
head
once
the
glass
got
to
my
table
the
reddish
hue
was
nice
and
applicable
to
the
moment
smell
was
good
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
was
kind
of
average
i
didnt
expect
the
spice
which
ended
up
being
quite
nice
in
some
sips
weird
in
others
mouthfeel
was
averagemedium
and
drinkability
was
easy
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
actually
liked
this
beer
but
could
not
stand
to
have
another
due
to
the
drying
qualities
of
the
spices
kind
of
a
shame
not
the
most
refined
or
balanced
winter
warmer
but
if
you
like
spicy
beers
which
i
love
for
this
style
than
try
this
out
looking
pretty
good
a
dark
molasses
color
with
an
airy
head
that
thins
out
quickly
smell
was
overpowering
with
cloves
and
some
other
unidentifiable
spices
maybe
coriander
taste
was
a
bit
dry
malty
with
those
still
indistinguishable
spices
taking
over
aftertaste
had
the
characteristics
of
burnt
holidayflavored
coffee
and
some
brown
sugar
all
in
all
decent
but
not
what
ill
be
up
to
for
the
rest
of
this
winter
d
a
good
winter
beer
if
you
like
nutmeg
you
will
like
this
beer
couldnt
have
too
many
of
these
but
then
again
thats
generally
not
the
point
of
winter
beers
in
my
opinion
d
i
really
didnt
want
to
finish
this
one
but
im
usually
against
drain
pours
i
could
see
why
some
people
would
like
it
but
it
just
falls
short
all
over
the
place
imo
this
is
winter
spice
lovers
dream
not
something
i
could
session
a
good
dessert
or
nightcap
brew
comments
i
would
definitely
class
this
as
a
beer
that
goes
well
with
dessert
it
would
perfectly
compliment
a
large
hot
cinnamon
roll
or
a
slice
of
homemade
apple
pie
or
maybe
even
some
gingersnaps
poured
from
the
tap
into
a
pint
glass
deep
amber
color
with
some
solid
lace
that
however
doesnt
stick
around
long
smells
strongly
of
cinnamon
and
bubblegum
taste
is
powerful
and
spicey
but
smooth
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
mainly
a
good
medium
body
and
carbonation
that
felt
right
for
the
beer
this
is
definitely
on
the
verge
of
being
way
to
spiced
but
i
still
found
it
smooth
and
drinkable
compared
to
some
others
i
enjoyed
having
a
glass
but
wouldnt
have
more
than
1
maybe
2
in
a
night
i
would
really
have
liked
to
try
the
older
recipe
for
comparison
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
winters
night
now
to
what
counts
most
the
taste
and
its
really
nice
i
admit
for
a
festive
winter
spice
style
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
id
like
to
see
it
more
chewey
some
dryhopping
might
help
the
overall
sense
but
what
we
have
here
is
really
tasty
and
not
overblown
in
the
least
thankfully
nothing
cloying
at
all
here
this
reminds
me
of
a
holdiay
spice
tea
my
mom
used
to
have
theres
an
orange
pekoe
note
with
actual
orangecitrus
going
on
with
the
spices
every
sip
and
gulps
reveals
dimension
too
but
i
admit
i
oddly
dont
any
sense
of
malts
or
hops
if
there
are
any
i
can
still
tell
it
is
an
brew
but
this
is
designed
to
be
something
quite
different
of
course
check
out
harpoons
own
description
of
it
and
we
are
right
on
target
judge
it
for
what
it
is
not
against
your
expectations
prejudices
not
something
i
would
recommend
way
to
much
cinnamon
and
spice
i
usually
like
beers
like
this
though
this
is
just
to
much
d
pretty
strong
drinkability
and
definitely
a
winter
beer
its
light
and
has
a
moderate
abv
and
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
but
overall
not
one
of
harpoons
best
work
d
a
little
weird
and
super
smoky
i
prob
wouldnt
get
it
again
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
too
much
in
the
spice
department
makes
it
nearly
undrinkable
this
beer
is
very
tough
to
even
take
down
and
finish
i
bought
a
6
pack
drank
two
and
gave
away
the
rest
to
my
roomates
never
will
i
again
even
look
at
this
beer
drinkability
luckily
i
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
unless
this
was
the
only
craft
on
tap
or
around
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
seeking
a
winter
beer
that
taste
like
bmc
with
holiday
spices
and
a
subtle
malt
profile
a
one
and
done
for
me
this
is
average
as
far
as
drinkability
the
spices
are
a
little
much
libation
ive
liked
other
harpoon
offerings
but
this
just
isnt
a
good
flavor
profile
in
my
opinion
the
spice
and
malt
are
too
sharp
and
too
rough
not
something
ill
come
back
to
overall
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
the
spices
are
a
little
overdone
though
d
i
poured
three
out
of
the
six
bottles
on
separate
days
of
course
before
writing
this
review
however
i
have
yet
to
finish
one
its
a
struggle
each
time
i
you
like
these
spices
you
may
enjoy
this
beer
more
than
i
do
pours
a
very
clear
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
tanned
head
faint
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
and
not
much
head
retension
very
strong
aroma
of
spices
that
is
borderline
offensive
like
a
holiday
candle
shoved
in
your
face
bold
amounts
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
a
bit
of
citrus
filling
it
out
and
initially
had
some
clove
and
banana
but
the
other
spices
dominate
the
aroma
taste
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
slight
bitterness
in
the
front
but
it
immediately
turns
to
spices
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
some
citrus
in
the
finish
not
really
picking
up
on
the
malt
character
you
get
with
other
examples
of
this
style
a
pretty
deep
copper
with
reddish
hues
light
cap
of
very
nice
proportions
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smell
is
nicely
spiced
with
sweet
caramel
malts
and
yeasty
breads
taste
brings
a
lovely
fruitiness
with
a
surprising
note
of
light
banana
nutmeg
cinnamonand
light
clove
nice
leafy
hops
in
the
finish
decent
feel
with
moderately
crisp
carbonation
pretty
easy
drinker
for
the
cold
months
a
nice
one
out
of
the
harpoon
winter
box
drinkability
for
a
winter
warmer
you
could
do
worse
its
by
no
means
the
best
in
style
but
it
is
quite
lovely
on
a
winter
night
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
its
a
brown
colored
beer
with
plenty
of
carbonation
bubbles
visible
rising
inside
there
was
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
heavily
spiced
maybe
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
it
doesnt
smell
natural
though
the
spices
are
present
in
the
flavor
there
is
also
some
sweet
maltiness
the
is
a
flavor
in
the
finish
that
lingers
after
you
swallow
that
can
be
best
described
as
unpleasant
the
beer
has
a
light
body
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
dont
like
all
of
the
bubbles
collecting
on
my
tongue
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
i
wouldnt
drink
another
i
do
like
some
other
overly
and
artificially
spiced
beers
like
shipyards
pumpkinhead
but
this
one
just
doent
do
it
for
me
there
are
much
better
winter
beers
and
i
know
this
brewery
is
capable
of
making
a
better
beer
medium
body
and
light
to
medium
carbonation
at
first
this
smelled
okay
and
tasted
alright
but
the
more
i
drank
the
less
i
liked
it
the
last
few
sips
were
somewhat
of
a
struggle
i
just
wanted
it
to
be
over
wont
be
looking
for
this
again
drinks
ok
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
around
not
the
best
offering
from
a
pretty
decent
brewery
notes
that
wonderful
smell
gave
me
high
hopes
for
this
one
i
just
cant
get
past
that
cola
taste
though
otherwise
it
would
have
been
a
nice
easygoing
rendition
of
a
winter
warmer
d
great
beer
no
horrible
beer
no
slightly
above
average
maybe
winter
warmer
light
very
spicy
if
this
is
your
calling
card
then
try
this
beer
d
definitely
sessionable
drinkability
is
ok
i
had
this
with
a
sandwich
probably
would
be
better
with
hors
doeuvres
and
a
party
setting
in
any
case
you
wouldnt
want
to
swill
a
whole
bunch
of
these
because
of
the
spices
a
novelty
beer
not
bad
not
great
good
beer
but
not
necessarily
one
i
could
have
too
many
of
surprisingly
low
abv
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
with
this
one
and
dont
mind
the
spicyness
of
it
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
spicy
and
different
its
not
bad
it
had
a
very
spicy
minty
taste
to
it
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
definitely
a
thick
fullbodied
beer
theres
also
a
hint
of
caramel
i
think
in
there
that
gives
it
some
sweetness
this
beer
has
a
pleasant
color
but
its
nose
is
too
sweet
when
it
should
be
closer
to
the
drier
spices
the
smell
is
a
bit
like
juicy
fruit
honestly
the
taste
doesnt
really
correspond
to
the
aroma
as
the
first
thing
to
dominate
is
clove
thats
not
bad
in
itself
but
then
a
lot
of
other
flavors
begin
to
dispute
with
that
note
and
the
result
is
somewhat
chemical
tasting
bottom
line
winter
warmer
suffers
from
an
unbalanced
charge
of
spices
it
seems
to
have
one
too
many
and
the
spices
clash
with
themselves
and
with
what
the
beer
is
trying
to
do
the
boor
at
the
spice
party
may
be
nutmeg
sam
adams
does
this
sort
of
thing
much
better
in
their
several
holiday
ales
not
all
of
which
are
spiced
even
drinkability
i
made
a
mixed
sixpack
at
total
wine
of
different
winter
ales
this
was
somehow
the
only
one
that
was
spiced
i
had
lowish
expectations
and
was
somewhat
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
very
spice
forward
and
theres
not
too
much
else
going
on
but
does
taste
good
for
what
it
is
i
dont
really
want
another
hop
tasted
diminished
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
not
what
i
expected
after
reading
all
the
bad
reviews
d
fair
not
a
session
beer
simply
because
it
only
comes
in
a
seasonal
varietypack
this
i
hate
to
say
really
isnt
very
good
the
spice
is
entirely
too
powerful
its
cloyingly
sweet
everything
is
out
of
whack
and
the
concept
of
balance
seems
to
have
been
lost
on
harpoons
brewmaster
on
this
one
very
glad
i
had
the
sense
to
grab
a
single
instead
of
springing
for
a
sixer
a
real
shame
as
i
quite
like
several
other
beers
brewed
by
harpoon
its
kinda
like
carbonated
water
with
a
lot
of
christmas
spices
or
maybe
burnt
christmas
cookies
but
its
still
fairly
enjoyable
d
mediocre
easy
enough
to
drink
but
can
get
sick
of
the
spices
quickly
this
beer
is
nice
a
moderately
alcohol
sessionable
and
very
spicy
brew
i
had
this
at
stocks
and
blondes
in
chicago
and
on
a
cold
december
day
near
christmas
this
beer
really
hit
the
spot
imo
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
can
be
done
to
screw
up
a
winter
warmer
and
i
thought
this
beer
pulled
the
style
off
nicely
it
looked
good
brilliant
clear
body
of
dark
brown
nice
head
presence
and
retention
smelled
seasonally
spicy
nutmeg
cinammon
maybe
allspice
and
cardamom
but
thats
reaching
for
my
olfactive
skills
and
tasted
like
christmas
mouthfeel
was
a
touch
thin
this
was
a
solid
basebeer
maybe
a
caramely
and
weakly
hopped
amber
ale
that
was
wellspiced
i
liked
it
and
think
it
appropriate
for
the
season
i
can
see
by
most
reviews
here
they
were
not
happy
with
the
strong
spice
of
this
brew
i
however
loved
the
prescence
of
nutmeg
clove
and
cinnamon
that
dominates
this
brew
nice
dark
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
and
descent
lacing
even
a
nice
spicy
smell
in
are
latest
drinking
session
this
was
the
surprised
hit
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
do
think
my
limit
would
be
two
in
a
sitting
as
much
as
i
liked
the
spicy
flavor
i
think
it
is
overpowering
and
that
my
taste
buds
would
revolt
before
too
long
the
smell
and
taste
are
dominated
by
a
ridiculous
amount
of
sweet
and
synthetic
spicing
i
cant
pick
up
any
other
aromas
or
flavors
mouth
is
cloying
which
makes
drinking
quite
a
chore
no
thank
you
decently
good
beer
surprised
at
the
low
scores
borders
on
a
drainpour
ill
stick
with
harpoon
ipa
harpoon
winter
warmer
is
way
better
then
last
years
i
actually
got
it
down
but
also
seems
like
a
chore
to
keep
drinking
it
has
nothing
to
keep
me
interested
very
long
d
moderate
i
liked
the
spices
but
not
the
aftertaste
of
the
base
beer
ill
have
to
try
this
in
the
bottle
and
see
if
it
tastes
any
different
a
nice
winter
warmer
but
a
bit
of
a
headscratcher
not
overly
spiced
in
my
opinion
though
d
im
having
trouble
finishing
this
one
bleh
decent
taste
but
not
one
for
multiples
sip
one
and
move
on
a
pretty
dark
clear
amber
tiny
fizzy
head
it
smelled
strongly
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
along
with
some
malts
and
mild
banana
it
tastes
sweet
like
pumpkin
pie
noticeable
malts
despite
the
strong
flavors
it
still
comes
across
as
thin
perhaps
like
watereddown
banana
bread
if
that
were
possible
but
overall
pleasant
if
not
awesome
a
pretty
poor
beer
not
much
flavor
besides
the
spices
i
dont
know
if
the
dryness
is
from
being
overattenuated
or
the
hops
but
not
really
expected
for
a
rich
winter
warmer
stay
away
from
this
beer
d
a
little
tough
to
handle
all
the
spice
not
bad
to
have
one
or
two
but
thats
the
cutoff
i
wont
break
it
down
into
detail
other
than
to
say
try
it
if
your
curious
but
that
would
be
the
only
reason
drinkabilitycertainly
drinkable
you
have
to
really
enjoy
spice
though
not
exactly
a
session
beer
for
me
anywayi
could
stand
1
maybe
2
at
a
time
i
can
see
women
loving
this
had
this
as
part
of
harpoons
winter
sampler
12
pack
ive
had
this
before
and
have
never
been
impressed
it
is
simply
ale
with
a
lot
of
spices
dumped
in
plenty
of
flavors
but
no
balance
at
all
or
subtlety
might
be
okay
at
a
party
where
no
one
cares
about
the
quality
of
wassail
otherwise
just
leave
this
alone
not
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
it
was
finishable
but
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
again
way
too
overspiced
if
you
ask
me
light
tan
head
which
barely
covers
the
surface
forms
islands
of
larger
bubbles
fades
swiftly
but
leaves
more
lacing
than
youd
expect
steady
flow
of
ginger
cinnamon
nutmeg
in
the
nose
not
overbearing
adds
in
orange
citrus
brown
sugar
not
that
sweet
and
possesses
a
clear
hoppy
spine
the
apricot
and
peach
scents
subdued
too
and
in
lockstep
with
the
rest
mediumbodied
carbonation
gives
it
a
charge
and
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
churn
the
coriander
nutmeg
cinnamon
spice
is
there
lighter
on
the
clove
presents
smooth
maltiness
yet
stays
dry
and
doesnt
soak
into
the
palate
much
grains
and
hoppy
grasses
keep
it
on
a
generally
equal
distribution
none
of
the
respective
elements
deep
or
resonant
hence
in
the
end
it
does
not
make
a
lasting
impression
swift
denouement
drinkability
not
much
of
a
beer
id
go
looking
for
again
given
harpoons
name
i
see
this
as
a
big
dissapointent
way
too
spicy
if
the
flavors
were
slightly
subdued
this
might
be
decent
otherwise
stick
to
your
winter
guns
and
avoid
this
mess
of
a
beer
i
remembered
this
beer
from
last
year
i
actually
quite
liked
it
then
it
was
full
bodied
and
malty
and
full
of
flavor
last
year
this
years
version
is
watery
bitter
and
had
no
malt
body
what
so
ever
really
disappointed
i
do
taste
a
bit
of
sweetness
caramelcandy
kind
of
flavor
it
seems
like
they
are
trying
to
compete
with
fall
beers
with
the
flavor
profile
not
robust
enough
for
a
winter
warmer
nonetheless
i
give
props
to
harpoon
for
having
the
cajones
to
compete
with
boston
beer
company
in
ma
its
a
microcosm
of
the
craft
beer
movement
esp
considering
boston
beer
co
is
about
to
officially
leave
the
craft
beer
arena
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
and
tried
to
like
it
but
just
couldnt
dig
the
flavor
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
harpoon
winter
warmer
needs
work
fortunately
a
little
work
could
go
a
very
long
way
just
tone
down
the
spices
that
alone
would
open
the
door
for
quite
a
bit
of
the
other
flavor
to
shine
through
i
know
its
there
its
just
buried
meh
too
many
great
winter
warmers
out
there
to
spend
much
time
on
this
one
skip
it
and
pick
up
one
of
the
good
ones
poured
a
dark
copper
with
one
finger
offwhite
head
a
nice
faint
smell
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
spice
and
some
pepper
smooth
easydrinking
thintomedium
body
with
hints
of
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
underneath
a
strong
balance
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
possible
clove
and
there
are
citric
hop
notes
as
well
finishes
clean
and
sweet
this
isnt
really
a
beer
to
warm
up
with
but
it
is
nice
to
polish
one
off
after
a
meal
copper
to
orange
in
color
strong
banana
scented
nose
with
minimal
head
some
prickle
is
apparent
from
the
carbonation
the
presentation
is
definitely
crisp
and
the
carbonation
causes
it
to
bubble
in
the
mouth
the
finish
has
some
grip
similar
to
an
oaky
red
wine
and
some
sour
notes
note
to
be
negative
but
perhaps
they
should
adjust
their
winter
warmer
recipe
each
year
like
some
other
high
profile
breweries
do
this
isnt
a
bad
one
at
least
at
the
temp
i
had
it
and
whatever
other
contributing
factors
are
involved
im
sure
there
are
winter
warmers
that
arent
so
strong
on
the
spices
and
that
balance
out
better
the
beer
had
a
nutmeg
medicine
type
taste
very
undrinkable
in
my
book
sorry
there
are
many
winter
warmers
that
are
better
then
this
i
am
sure
but
i
am
turned
off
to
that
type
because
of
this
experience
final
thoughts
this
beer
works
as
an
after
dinner
beer
i
get
a
hankering
for
it
every
holiday
season
but
that
is
a
enough
for
me
i
would
give
this
season
a
try
but
would
consider
trying
a
mix
pack
or
a
six
before
diving
in
with
a
twelve
tastes
will
definitely
vary
if
you
bought
a
sixpack
you
might
consider
leaving
a
couple
out
for
santa
on
christmas
eve
otherwise
you
might
be
hardpressed
to
get
through
the
rest
d
does
give
you
a
sense
of
warming
up
probably
good
in
the
fall
when
its
just
starting
to
get
cold
could
probably
use
this
to
dispatch
other
tastes
during
reviews
like
coffee
does
for
the
nose
for
smelling
things
d
opening
the
bottle
the
spice
aroma
is
faint
and
appealing
but
after
the
pour
the
smell
and
taste
is
overpowering
with
a
watery
backbone
certainly
something
different
and
looks
the
part
but
i
dont
want
another
yeah
okay
its
a
decent
beer
there
is
definitely
a
solid
spice
feel
to
it
not
much
different
from
other
titular
winter
beers
probably
best
in
october
as
a
relatively
cheap
deviation
from
the
norm
out
there
i
dont
have
many
major
complaints
about
it
but
it
didnt
strike
me
as
particularly
unique
or
great
spice
nutmeg
some
cinnamon
decently
balanced
but
not
a
top
priority
in
the
future
spicy
yeast
fruity
banana
clove
maybe
anise
sweet
malty
interesting
pleasant
taste
is
not
as
interesting
as
the
nose
mildly
fruity
spicy
malty
sweet
mild
hop
bitterness
in
finish
add
to
complexity
feeling
is
thin
body
lightmed
carbonation
low
benign
with
a
touch
of
biterness
in
the
finish
goes
down
easily
enough
but
not
substantial
enough
to
draw
me
in
for
another
this
beer
smells
better
than
it
is
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
id
certainly
drink
it
again
just
not
more
than
one
in
a
night
too
spicy
taste
is
sweet
syrupy
with
all
those
spices
thrown
in
its
too
much
for
me
and
after
about
half
a
pint
i
need
some
water
and
another
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
with
some
good
initial
head
fading
to
decent
thin
head
with
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
excellent
aroma
a
nice
thick
and
hearty
malt
with
loads
of
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
all
of
it
strong
with
none
of
them
overpowering
the
others
good
taste
nice
spiciness
good
cinnamon
and
orange
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
to
bitter
it
up
goes
down
fine
if
not
fantastic
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
notes
ive
liked
everything
harpoon
has
made
to
this
point
i
guess
even
real
quality
breweries
have
there
version
of
sa
cranberry
lambic
overall
i
find
this
one
quite
drinkable
for
a
winter
spice
beer
it
is
extrememly
spicy
and
probably
will
not
satisfy
the
trained
palate
looking
for
a
more
complex
bigger
winter
warmer
freshness
is
key
to
this
beer
drink
it
up
quick
out
of
a
bottle
this
one
looked
good
it
was
a
copper
color
with
some
amber
highlights
the
head
was
khakicolored
and
it
quickly
formed
a
sticky
cap
that
left
lacing
in
legs
like
a
wine
the
aroma
was
like
a
pumpkin
ale
nutmeg
and
allspice
with
a
rich
maltiness
the
flavors
were
similar
rich
caramel
malt
lots
of
spices
dominated
by
nutmeg
touches
of
toasted
malt
and
an
understated
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
carbonation
soft
and
the
body
full
ive
heard
that
others
really
dont
like
this
one
maybe
because
its
not
really
a
winter
warmer
but
i
dont
give
a
damn
what
they
say
i
thought
it
pretty
good
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
once
or
twice
during
the
winter
season
but
you
will
be
disappointed
if
you
expect
anything
more
poured
to
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
slight
light
tan
head
that
did
not
have
much
size
nor
retention
aroma
is
spicy
smells
a
lot
like
pumpkin
pie
and
cinnamon
having
a
hard
time
to
clearly
pick
up
malts
to
me
the
aromas
are
ok
but
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
different
or
a
winter
warmer
the
spices
come
out
clearly
in
the
flavor
but
are
actually
a
little
muted
based
on
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
aroma
malts
come
out
more
spice
flavor
seems
to
be
more
cinnamon
but
am
picking
up
some
nutmeg
it
is
not
bad
going
down
pretty
tasty
but
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
one
per
session
overall
it
is
a
fair
brew
clearly
not
a
favorite
of
mine
and
imo
a
weaker
offering
than
the
norm
from
harpoon
this
was
an
interesting
beer
im
sold
on
the
spiciness
but
i
thing
this
one
should
offer
a
little
more
than
that
i
wouldnt
have
any
problem
drinking
these
during
the
holidays
it
just
seems
like
that
kind
of
beer
one
word
disappointed
a
few
years
back
at
a
party
we
threw
for
the
holidays
russ
ryan
and
jer
brought
a
case
of
this
and
a
good
time
was
had
by
all
the
cinnamon
sang
and
the
beer
balanced
quite
well
fast
forward
to
this
year
an
ales
body
for
sure
with
a
hard
reddishorange
hue
and
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
would
frame
better
if
if
it
traced
out
as
brother
jer
warned
cinnamon
liberalism
to
the
point
of
doa
cough
syrupy
sweet
the
beer
presents
smoothly
on
the
palate
with
little
fanfare
or
character
not
a
bad
thing
just
not
distinguishing
a
harsh
reality
here
at
first
all
i
can
taste
is
sucrets
as
my
ears
reddenthis
beers
malt
is
fighting
for
its
life
to
little
avail
spices
and
herbs
simmer
into
a
hodgepodge
backdrop
with
a
bandaid
taste
fluttering
in
late
a
fan
of
harpoons
octoberfest
and
at
a
pleasant
friendliness
with
the
ufo
i
find
this
beer
requires
too
much
work
from
the
drinker
to
be
accepting
of
its
quirky
flavoring
too
much
is
going
on
to
produce
an
enjoyable
uniform
taste
i
didnt
exactly
struggle
to
finish
the
glass
but
i
wasnt
very
enthusiastic
about
it
its
just
not
that
great
poured
from
a
bottle
into
my
harpoon
winter
warmer
stemmed
glass
copper
red
color
white
head
disappeared
quickly
decent
amount
of
lacing
smell
was
quite
potent
with
cloves
being
right
up
front
as
for
the
taste
it
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
or
tweeked
a
bit
tastes
a
bit
too
fake
to
me
kinda
like
swallowing
cinnamon
potpourri
decent
beer
to
have
one
now
and
then
but
i
cannot
drink
more
than
a
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
used
to
be
my
favorite
winter
warmer
years
ago
then
i
found
out
there
were
much
better
ones
that
were
just
as
easy
to
obtain
and
enjoy
its
a
great
winter
brew
in
my
opinion
12
ouncer
comes
wo
freshness
info
pours
clear
light
mahogany
amber
minimal
to
no
head
no
lace
and
seems
to
be
on
the
low
side
carbonation
wise
holiday
spice
on
the
nose
thin
toasted
malts
more
thanksgiving
pie
spice
notes
and
but
continued
thinness
and
lack
of
any
sizzle
metallic
and
off
putting
finish
pretty
dull
stuff
big
disappointment
from
a
good
brewery
though
my
family
who
drink
moosehead
downed
on
christmas
eve
with
no
complaints
i
tried
this
brew
on
the
advice
of
a
friend
while
the
color
was
appealing
i
enjoy
darker
amber
colored
beers
the
smell
and
taste
was
very
average
it
was
probably
a
little
too
cold
to
get
a
good
and
proper
taste
bu
in
general
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
i
would
much
rather
have
redhook
winterhook
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
easy
on
the
palate
and
nose
and
not
too
heavy
drinkability
way
too
spicy
in
my
opinion
i
enjoy
spiced
winter
ales
butt
his
is
taken
to
a
level
that
obliterates
and
malt
or
hop
flavors
it
simply
tastes
like
peppermint
and
clove
water
pass
overall
not
horrible
but
not
great
d
overall
harpoon
winter
welcome
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
that
is
worth
a
shot
during
the
holiday
season
nice
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
head
no
retention
the
aroma
is
nutmeg
and
cinammon
this
is
not
subtle
in
the
least
the
nutmeg
has
a
more
dominate
flavor
in
the
taste
of
the
beer
a
little
overbearing
in
my
opinion
again
not
very
subtle
i
drank
two
of
these
at
a
party
over
the
weekend
wanting
to
have
a
second
shot
at
the
flavor
maybe
nutmeg
is
just
not
my
thing
but
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
balance
the
beer
had
a
lightmedium
body
and
is
a
very
but
the
fact
that
it
had
little
balance
and
seemed
overspiced
i
dont
find
this
very
drinkable
nikki
bottle
pours
a
middleamber
with
little
in
the
way
of
head
and
nothing
in
the
way
of
head
retention
or
lacing
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
pie
cinnamon
clove
and
faint
nutmeg
or
gingerbread
flavor
is
that
of
a
pumpkin
pie
with
too
much
water
added
to
the
filling
cinnamon
and
a
clove
tang
at
the
end
good
carbonation
and
light
body
makes
this
beer
less
filling
and
worlds
less
overwhelming
than
most
winterspiced
ales
this
beer
almost
almost
makes
me
want
to
stop
calling
harpoon
a
pseudomicro
then
again
im
from
boston
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
little
crispness
in
the
finish
but
theres
also
a
lingering
sweet
spiciness
a
gingerbread
cookie
blended
with
an
amber
ale
this
is
just
hard
to
get
down
and
one
is
enough
its
too
bad
because
at
the
first
whiff
you
are
wishing
that
it
would
be
great
its
not
i
like
spicedflavored
beer
but
this
one
is
just
a
bit
overdone
d
an
ok
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
more
than
one
just
to
try
might
be
good
with
licorice
or
anise
cookies
a
good
addition
to
the
harpoon
winter
variety
pack
but
not
something
i
would
buy
regularly
by
itself
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
dated
031509329
i
dont
think
it
is
as
bad
as
the
bros
and
previous
raters
i
actually
kind
of
like
this
one
the
aroma
has
a
sensation
of
cloves
the
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
and
the
flavor
has
a
clovelike
hoppy
sensation
its
not
all
that
bad
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
i
had
a
sample
of
it
at
a
tasting
and
it
was
quite
good
then
i
think
the
bitter
tasting
hops
in
this
one
just
kinda
ruin
the
rest
of
what
is
a
good
beer
overall
its
not
as
bad
as
other
people
make
it
out
to
be
as
far
as
winter
warmers
go
this
one
is
lacking
character
some
medium
to
full
bodied
roundedness
and
interesting
spiciness
the
recipe
of
this
beer
has
changed
significantly
over
the
years
it
used
to
wallop
you
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
these
days
it
is
pretty
toned
down
there
is
a
definite
nutmeg
spice
to
the
beer
but
this
is
overall
quite
bland
staying
within
the
winter
warmer
genre
i
had
harpoons
ww
before
tasting
an
old
fezziwig
from
sam
adams
and
the
difference
is
substantial
the
harpoon
ww
is
amber
clear
some
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
entirely
adequate
with
some
nutmeg
coming
through
the
beer
is
just
nothing
special
rather
than
modifying
a
rather
robust
but
flawed
recipe
it
seems
as
though
harpoon
opted
for
boring
simple
and
by
the
numbers
its
okay
but
nothing
special
perhaps
they
should
come
up
with
winter
warmer
3
0
i
taste
the
standard
malt
sweetness
a
moderate
amount
of
malt
taste
here
but
there
a
bitterness
or
sourness
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
its
not
hop
bitterness
or
a
good
sourness
almost
a
bitterness
from
the
spices
used
whatever
it
is
it
just
doesnt
mesh
well
i
was
expecting
more
cinammony
like
some
of
the
pumpkin
ales
out
there
the
overall
experience
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
everything
just
feels
kind
of
flat
not
just
the
carbonation
but
also
the
beers
appearance
taste
spicing
dont
get
me
wrong
i
hate
overspiced
seasonal
beers
but
i
would
like
to
see
the
spice
profile
here
add
more
to
the
package
than
an
underlying
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
the
same
way
no
stickiness
or
coating
just
meh
mediocrity
all
around
its
certainly
drinkable
if
you
like
it
with
a
light
body
but
i
would
rather
find
something
i
like
the
taste
of
a
little
more
3
05
good
body
well
carbonated
but
as
for
drinkability
the
spicing
keeps
you
down
to
one
too
bad
would
be
much
better
if
they
had
more
malt
and
maybe
a
higher
abv
if
i
see
this
again
i
would
not
hesitate
to
try
it
once
more
drinkability
i
can
finish
the
one
i
just
had
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
one
again
maybe
theyll
change
it
up
next
winter
too
much
of
a
spice
profile
and
too
little
of
any
hopmalt
or
any
beer
characteristic
oyears
ago
would
enjoy
this
but
guess
my
palate
changed
very
much
and
now
all
the
covering
things
like
spices
and
other
characteristics
were
easily
looks
past
to
expose
whats
really
there
an
unimpressive
brew
d
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
it
just
isnt
balanced
at
all
the
spices
jump
out
but
there
is
nothing
to
compliment
the
flavors
untamed
bitterness
coupled
with
a
subpar
mouthfeel
makes
one
of
these
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
get
through
overall
this
reminds
me
of
a
weak
and
unbalanced
pumpkin
ale
without
the
pumpkin
d
if
you
are
into
spiced
ales
this
is
a
decent
brew
as
others
have
said
its
not
really
a
true
winter
warmer
but
it
works
well
for
a
lighter
alternative
i
happen
to
like
the
spicy
taste
and
these
are
mild
enough
and
cheap
enough
to
share
with
others
that
dont
usually
drink
craft
beers
i
enjoy
a
few
six
packs
of
these
at
christmastime
but
its
not
something
id
drink
all
winter
d
its
easy
to
drink
because
its
nothing
too
big
flavor
is
sufficient
but
could
be
a
lot
better
still
a
decent
winter
warmer
that
will
definitely
please
those
looking
for
a
lighter
more
drinkable
alternative
the
first
thing
that
will
hit
you
are
the
spices
very
spicy
but
in
a
good
way
not
cloying
nor
too
sweet
this
is
what
i
expect
in
a
christmaswinter
ale
hearty
taste
with
a
robustness
and
good
body
and
this
is
what
harpoon
winter
warmer
delivers
good
color
and
appearance
with
an
aroma
that
hints
at
the
spiciness
but
the
taste
is
what
makes
me
give
it
such
high
marks
tried
it
at
the
brewery
first
and
liked
it
enough
to
buy
some
for
the
fridge
at
home
not
terrible
to
drink
but
the
spices
will
get
to
you
quick
had
one
from
a
sample
pack
i
bought
dark
clear
red
amber
with
a
slight
dullness
and
little
lacing
aromas
had
a
seasonal
spice
of
cinnamon
mixed
with
a
nutty
flavor
the
taste
was
a
little
too
sharp
and
very
dry
with
a
malty
sweetness
that
trails
off
to
a
bitter
aftertaste
a
good
mouthfeel
though
that
includes
a
dry
crispness
and
good
carbonation
the
flavors
do
not
help
it
from
being
refreshing
however
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
in
a
winter
party
but
nothing
too
special
here
pretty
good
overall
that
said
i
love
harpoon
winter
warmer
its
a
great
guiltfree
cheap
thrill
like
bon
jovi
karaoke
got
this
one
in
a
mixed
sixer
havent
been
particularly
blown
away
by
harpoon
beers
and
this
one
falls
in
that
generally
mediocre
area
look
is
good
deep
maroonamber
color
crystal
clear
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
nose
is
a
ton
of
nutmeg
with
a
touch
of
caramel
not
a
lot
going
on
there
flavor
is
basically
eggnog
nutmeg
and
spiciness
and
cookies
again
a
pretty
straightforward
spicy
malt
flavor
body
is
appropriate
with
busy
carbonation
overall
its
not
terrible
but
not
particularly
interesting
either
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
a
poor
attempt
at
its
stated
style
harpoon
really
needs
to
bump
this
one
up
to
a
fall
seasonal
or
simply
rename
it
d
i
think
this
is
an
average
session
beer
for
the
winter
overall
i
always
enjoy
a
couple
of
six
packs
before
the
end
of
the
year
but
nothing
i
would
drink
regularly
anymore
a
confusing
beer
which
does
not
come
close
to
other
winter
warmers
out
there
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
has
a
caramel
color
light
head
you
can
smell
the
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
doesnt
smell
sweet
though
it
smells
somewhat
bitter
the
taste
is
sharply
bitter
but
not
hoppy
it
is
the
spice
it
has
all
the
spice
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
none
of
the
sweetness
really
wouldnt
drink
multiple
or
drink
it
again
if
i
hadnt
bought
a
6pack
lacks
the
depth
of
a
good
winter
warmer
needs
some
more
malt
depth
dissapointing
beer
from
a
brewery
i
usually
really
enjoy
overall
it
was
decent
nothing
spectacular
but
i
guess
i
really
was
not
expecting
that
too
much
overall
not
bad
probably
would
not
order
it
again
but
would
not
hate
it
if
it
was
offered
m
d
has
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
but
it
flows
down
smoothly
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
is
looking
for
an
above
average
winter
beer
that
doesnt
cost
too
much
was
like
8
for
the
6er
drinkability
this
is
an
interesting
beer
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
every
day
but
it
certainly
has
its
place
i
agree
that
its
a
bit
heavy
on
the
spices
but
i
still
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
and
it
really
has
a
warming
effect
perfect
for
cold
days
or
the
holidays
d
i
could
put
down
two
if
i
had
to
but
why
would
i
want
to
with
all
the
great
winter
beers
to
choose
from
this
one
is
best
left
on
the
shelf
maybe
if
it
was
summer
this
would
be
more
favorable
imo
cant
get
passed
the
banana
like
a
hefe
d
its
interesting
but
it
comes
across
as
more
of
a
beerflavored
spiced
cider
something
about
it
just
seems
too
overthetop
spiced
for
my
tastes
decently
drinkable
a
pretty
average
brew
the
spices
may
be
a
bit
over
bearing
but
not
really
its
called
a
winter
warmer
but
this
is
only
5
5
abv
so
its
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
most
breweries
go
for
high
alcoholheavy
body
for
this
style
but
harpoon
went
with
more
of
a
holiday
spice
twist
everyone
has
their
own
interpretations
of
a
winter
seasonal
just
because
it
is
different
doesnt
make
it
bad
a
solid
beer
from
a
limited
dated
journal
pours
a
pale
orangered
with
nice
visible
carbonation
aroma
is
dominated
by
nutmeg
and
malt
with
a
sweet
kick
to
it
that
continues
in
the
taste
spiciness
is
powerful
with
a
quick
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
this
bottle
was
in
the
back
of
my
dads
fridge
at
the
end
of
summer
2008
not
sure
when
it
was
bought
but
probably
last
winter
not
a
bad
drink
this
harpoon
brew
but
not
what
i
think
of
when
im
thinking
winter
warmer
frankly
it
could
stand
more
body
more
malt
and
more
booze
but
even
as
it
is
i
like
the
spiciness
as
a
nice
change
of
pace
easy
drinker
no
problem
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
in
sequence
when
tailgating
and
eating
woodroasted
wholehog
barbecue
as
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
go
great
with
pork
notes
i
expected
something
with
balance
and
something
with
a
higher
abv
that
teaches
the
lesson
that
one
should
learn
not
to
expect
anything
not
worth
the
time
or
money
eric
md
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
sodalike
albeit
not
as
fizzy
while
the
spiciness
seems
to
help
lift
up
the
palate
overall
but
not
quite
adds
to
the
overall
flavour
this
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
in
need
of
a
balance
as
well
as
more
complexity
in
the
flavour
profile

ive
been
freezing
all
day
so
i
wanted
to
try
something
warming
while
not
terrible
this
wasnt
really
all
that
great
pours
a
copperamber
color
with
a
medium
head
which
settles
down
to
almost
nothing
ginger
and
a
spiced
aroma
followed
by
a
flavor
that
consists
of
ginger
nutmet
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
happy
halloween
i
guess
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
it
was
okay
but
thats
about
it
mouthfeel
is
spicy
good
weight
nice
carbonation
an
interesting
take
on
warmers
tried
it
unsuccessfully
with
a
meal
enjoyed
it
very
much
on
its
own
and
found
it
somewhat
enjoyable
with
salsa
may
or
may
not
buy
it
again
now
to
welcome
in
the
warmer
weather
and
leave
the
winter
warmers
behind
i
will
of
course
be
looking
for
this
one
next
winter
ill
admit
this
is
more
of
a
family
drink
than
anything
else
your
wife
would
love
it
your
grandmother
would
love
it
but
thats
what
makes
it
a
really
really
good
beer
in
my
opinion
i
wouldnt
give
it
the
time
of
day
on
a
table
with
guinness
or
allagash
but
nonetheless
a
fine
creation
by
harpoon
i
dont
regret
buying
the
six
pack
its
hard
to
regret
buying
a
six
pack
of
anything
for
4
99
but
unless
i
hear
about
a
recipe
change
through
the
grapevine
i
wont
be
picking
this
up
again
next
winter
or
even
next
postwinter
2006
brew
this
was
drunk
from
a
bottle
it
had
a
unique
flavor
built
off
their
standard
ipa
it
had
a
good
amount
of
clean
hops
but
with
easily
noticeable
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
added
one
of
the
cleanest
tasting
spicy
ales
ive
had
with
each
flavor
being
very
distinct
fairly
watery
but
not
too
thin
and
a
bit
carbonated
overall
pretty
good
for
a
special
occasion
but
nothing
id
want
to
drink
regularly
although
it
poured
a
dark
amber
and
pleasant
in
appearance
this
holiday
brews
quality
comes
from
its
taste
and
smell
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
are
very
apparent
and
aid
this
in
being
a
quite
delicious
spiced
beer
although
heavy
its
quite
drinkable
overall
trying
too
hard
this
one
i
like
spiced
beers
but
i
kinda
like
them
a
bit
more
toned
down
than
this
the
body
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
really
falls
flat
and
could
use
some
malt
backing
to
balance
the
overspiced
characteristics
so
have
a
nice
day
d
this
one
is
not
at
all
for
me
but
if
you
like
fruit
cake
you
might
dig
this
dnotes
i
view
this
beer
the
same
way
i
look
back
to
when
i
netflixed
battle
of
the
planets
a
show
i
loved
when
i
was
a
kid
as
an
adult
it
sucked
winter
warmer
kind
of
piqued
my
interest
in
craft
brews
about
8
years
or
so
ago
and
i
remembered
it
fondly
trying
it
again
made
me
realize
that
it
kind
of
blows
12oz
bottle
from
clarendon
wines
in
boston
pours
a
clear
light
ruby
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
strong
smell
of
spices
cinnamon
i
think
and
a
bit
of
orange
the
taste
is
spice
upfrront
which
quickly
gives
way
to
well
nothing
this
beer
is
felt
only
on
the
tongue
with
the
spices
and
there
is
little
else
to
it
quite
thin
disappointing
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
watery
it
finishes
with
tons
of
spice
cinnamon
chiefly
lingering
in
the
mouth
this
is
not
a
drinkable
beer
i
recommend
that
all
who
value
beer
and
your
soul
for
that
matter
stay
away
from
this
beer
at
this
point
i
am
glad
that
i
received
this
beer
for
freeim
not
all
that
happy
that
i
received
it
now
that
ive
tasted
it
i
am
dumber
and
my
taste
buds
have
regressed
for
having
drunk
this
beer
id
be
wrought
with
pain
if
i
actually
paid
for
this
crap
dlets
just
say
one
was
enough
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
darker
and
heavier
and
not
spoiled
with
spices
i
will
not
hold
this
against
harpoon
dno
way
was
a
dump
after
two
sips
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
bubbly
finishing
tingly
not
too
drinkable
for
me
due
to
the
sweetness
and
heavyhanded
nutmeg
hopefully
next
years
will
be
different
but
from
the
reviews
ive
read
through
it
seems
that
the
recipe
may
have
been
altered
from
what
i
remember
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
around
the
edges
the
nose
is

nutmeg
cinnimon
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
big
on

some

drinkable
a
tasty
brew
afterthought
with
so
many
really
good
really
accessible
winter
warmers
out
there
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
for
anyone
to
buy
this
particular
product
except
out
of
sheer
curiosity
youve
been

a
spice
lovers
beerwish
it
had
more
beery
taste
and
less
spicynessvery
unbalanced
overall
well
it
is
certainly
spiced
what
lies
underneath
it
well
not
much
more
than
a
mediocre
amber
ale
not
as
malty
and
hefty
as
i
would
like
in
a
winter
warmer
and
the
spicing
while
making
it
a
christmas
seasonal
is
just
too
much
imo
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
beer
i
am
normally
so
happy
with
harpoons
offerings
i
got
this
this
evening
when
i
was
out
and
i
had
to
send
it
back
normally
i
can
suck
it
up
and
drink
it
but
this
was
very
spicy
almost
a
sweet
quality
to
it
with
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
pie
type
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
and
the
appearance
but
nothing
else
is
worthwhile
sorry
harpoon
this
is
a
let
down
i
will
continue
to
drink
your
beers
but
never
winter
warmer
again
d
definitely
a
bit
heavy
on
the
spices
too
sweet
for
quaffing
but
still
pretty
tasty
and
certainly
good
for
the
winter
months
if
you
like
pumpkin
spices
this
beer
can
be
quite
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
the
spices
definitely
dominate
the
scent
and
taste
clove
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
a
bit
of
allspice
very
slick
mouthfeel
with
a
little
spicy
warmth
on
the
tongue
it
needs
a
little
more
malt
and
alcohol
a
little
medicinal
tasting
at
times
and
this
is
what
really
hurts
it
pours
a
golden
caramel
color
with
decent
head
the
smell
is
a
little
over
the
top
but
i
generally
liked
it
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
winter
ale
and
maybe
i
was
craving
pumpkin
pie
a
bit
lots
of
cinnamon
clove
allspice
and
nutmeg
the
taste
was
not
as
good
as
the
smell
too
much
pumpkin
spice
cake
flavor
not
enough
beer
flavor
mouthfeel
was
good
but
drinkability
only
average
due
to
the
too
strong
taste
a
solid
bright
color
color
with
a
big
lighttan
head
that
fizzles
to
a
scanty
cover
with
decent
blotchy
lacing
the
aroma
definitely
conjures
up
christmasy
ideas
with
bright
unmistakable
spruce
with
light
nutmeg
malt
very
bright
and
lively
festive
nice
the
flavor
delivers
more
minty
spruce
with
bubblegum
malt
theres
not
a
lot
more
to
say
solid
winter
ale
flavors
pronounced
spice
without
overdoing
it
medium
bodied
with
a
solid
but
delicate
carbonation
for
a
slightly
resinous
but
silky
feel
a
highly
drinkable
yet
distinctive
true
holiday
brew
very
nice
and
sessionable
really
this
a
beer
that
never
needed
to
happen
my
girl
bought
this
and
i
tried
one
what
a
mistake
the
color
and
the
head
are
nothing
special
the
nose
is
of
cinimon
and
nutmeg
not
what
i
really
want
in
my
beer
the
only
way
i
can
describe
the
flavor
is
by
saying
it
is
like
shoving
a
peice
of
pumkin
pie
in
a
harpoon
ipa
please
by
all
means
avoid
this
beer
i
can
easily
understand
though
if
you
dont
like
a
lot
spice
you
wont
like
this
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
barely
any
head
and
a
light
copper
appearance
smell
was
very
overwhelming
with
cinnamon
and
cloves
has
the
cinnamon
right
there
with
the
taste
which
i
felt
was
a
little
overpowering
somewhat
of
a
pumpkinish
taste
lighter
mouthfeel
was
a
little
surprise
as
i
anticipated
a
little
heavier
overall
not
too
bad
not
for
me
though
d
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
winter
warmer
that
ive
had
i
highly
recommend
this
one
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
thin
big
bubbled
off
white
head
forms
very
fizzy
disappears
very
fast
to
a
decent
layer
some
lace
spots
smell
is
malty
tons
of
spice
vegetables
some
floral
caramel
kind
of
buttery
not
too
bad
but
the
spices
are
a
bit
wacky
taste
is
insanely
spiced
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
cloves
caramel
veggies
butter
then
all
flavour
dies
kind
of
medicinal
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
very
sharp
pretty
unsatisfying
on
every
level
pours
a
nice
amber
color
from
the
bottle
with
a
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
a
bit
but
not
alot
the
aroma
is
of
winter
spices
alot
of
winter
spices
it
smells
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
is
the
best
way
to
put
it
the
taste
does
not
lie
it
tastes
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
strong
flavors
of
nutmeg
and
ginger
combine
for
an
overpowering
taste
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
i
would
say
that
it
is
drinkable
but
it
is
very
sweet
and
the
spices
are
overwhelming
drinkability
was
ok
like
average
nothing
exciting
little
too
much
on
the
spices
for
me
perhaps
for
dessert
with
some
good
homemade
apple
pie
and
a
hunk
of
aged
cheddar
this
might
serve
you
well
d
this
is
really
blowing
my
expectations
of
a
winter
warmer
the
spices
instead
of
tasting
simply
of
pie
are
delicious
and
the
strength
of
the
smell
and
taste
in
this
beer
is
increadible
great
job
harpoon
thin
mouth
feel
and
over
whelming
smell
and
taste
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
did
i
mention
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
because
that
is
all
you
will
notice
way
too
over
the
top
with
spices
hopefully
i
can
pass
off
the
rest
of
the
case
on
christmas
eve
because
after
one
of
these
i
want
something
else
to
finish
the
night
with
beer
should
not
taste
like
this
hints
of
spice
are
nice
but
this
overwhelming
in
your
face
dumping
of
spices
in
beer
is
way
over
the
top
very
nice
work
a
different
type
of
holiday
beer
to
be
enjoyed
in
moderation
i
cant
imagine
having
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
strong
strong
taste
tons
of
cinnamon
also
tastes
like
some
mint
the
smell
is
strong
but
actually
smells
very
good
but
the
taste
is
on
another
level
definitely
enjoyable
but
i
would
guess
in
small
quantities
probably
terrific
after
just
coming
in
from
the
cold
but
ive
been
on
the
couch
for
a
few
hours
definitely
worth
a
taste
and
an
impressive
amount
of
flavor
from
harpoon
this
beer
poured
a
golden
copper
color
with
a
generous
threefinger
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
the
smell
is
definitely
festive
with
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
pretty
close
to
the
smell
with
a
big
hit
of
spicy
cinnamon
up
front
leading
to
some
middling
nutmeg
and
just
the
tiniest
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
a
very
carbonated
which
i
think
matches
the
spiciness
rather
well
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
wouldnt
consider
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
from
a
standardsized
bottle
pours
a
copperbrown
color
that
is
relatively
lightercolored
compared
to
most
other
winter
warmers
ive
sampled
the
smell
is
a
powerful
cinnamonfireball
essence
which
bursts
through
taste
strongly
complements
the
aroma
with
the
cinnamon
aspect
being
dominant
to
the
point
of
almost
being
overwhelming
definitely
a
unique
tasting
brew
and
very
different
than
most
others
out
there
but
the
strong
cinnamon
flavor
seems
so
apparent
that
it
completely
overshadows
the
main
character
of
the
brew
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
not
superb
and
being
such
a
flavorful
brew
wouldnt
want
to
down
more
than
one
at
most
in
a
session
all
said
an
interesting
sample
and
worth
a
try
too
spicy
in
my
opinion
if
that
was
toned
down
a
bit
this
would
be
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
drinkability
is
ok
because
the
thin
beer
is
easy
to
drink
however
with
the
amount
of
spices
and
sharpness
one
couldnt
or
would
want
to
drink
too
many
of
these
nice
amber
color
with
just
a
bit
of
lace
and
a
thick
crown
holy
hot
cinnamon
oil
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
extract
is
so
overwhelming
that
you
can
feel
it
singeing
your
nasal
cavity
and
maybe
some
ginger
and
honey
the
is
christmas
potpourri
with
flavors
of
nutmeg
dry
cinnamon
bark
ginger
and
clove
that
absolutely
dominate
some
sweetness
and
tartness
late
in
the
finish
but
almost
astringent
the
spices
particularly
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
linger
on
far
too
long
descent
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
is
way
over
the
top
here
as
it
really
just
covers
up
what
might
be
a
good
beer
or
maybe
its
a
terrible
beer
who
knows
this
does
speak
of
christmas
the
bad
part
of
christmas
its
like
black
friday
stuffed
in
my
mouth
all
business
and
no
soul
12
oz
bottle
into
tulip
glass
a
amberred
thick
creamcolored
head
that
reduces
down
to
a
caked
on
film
decent
lacing
s
very
strong
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
sort
of
hard
to
get
much
beyond
that
roasted
malts
some
very
distant
grassy
hops
t
completely
dominated
by
cinnamon
brown
sugar
nutmeg
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
but
again
hard
to
get
much
beyond
the
spice
m
a
bit
thin
moderate
carbonation
d
im
a
bit
on
the
fence
on
one
hand
the
cinnamon
spice
is
kind
of
nice
especially
on
a
cold
winter
night
but
the
beer
snob
in
me
has
to
admit
that
the
thin
body
and
shallow
malt
profile
quickly
buckle
under
the
heavy
weight
of
way
way
too
much
spice
if
you
want
christmas
in
a
bottle
this
may
be
for
you
if
youre
feeling
scroogeish
want
something
a
bit
more
complex
i
would
steer
clear
i
think
this
would
be
a
better
beer
with
a
different
base
maybe
and
english
style
brown
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
with
my
meal
head
retention
was
alright
about
halfway
down
it
lost
it
i
was
surprised
to
find
it
on
tap
and
it
did
not
disappoint
a
great
winter
beer
i
do
enjoy
harpoon
but
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
their
winter
warmer
i
had
it
on
tap
last
year
and
thought
it
was
pretty
good
nice
mellow
spice
flavor
some
more
sediment
still
no
head
but
good
balance
and
noticeable
hop
bite
this
was
like
the
hyde
to
that
jekyl
allinall
i
was
disappointed
by
the
ww
i
dont
like
talking
trash
but
i
think
harpoon
knows
better
than
this
winter
beers
are
all
about
one
million
subtle
comfortable
flavors
keeping
your
taste
buds
guessing
but
this
one
tells
all
its
secrets
more
weight
more
depth
and
a
little
demure
would
take
this
beer
a
long
way
d
this
score
follows
my
observations
for
smell
and
taste
if
you
hate
them
this
would
be
a
nonstarter
for
drinkability
on
the
other
hand
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
i
could
see
drinking
this
on
a
cold
afternoon
watching
it
snow
outside
given
the
plsit
personality
i
put
this
one
down
as
firmly
in
the
middle
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
this
christmas
and
go
find
out
what
uncle
al
spiked
the
eggnog
with
gold
colored
beer
with
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
taste
was
extreme
cinnamon
and
very
little
else
this
is
the
first
beer
in
my
35
years
that
i
couldnt
finish
and
had
to
pour
down
the
drain
i
dont
know
what
makes
this
brewery
think
that
people
want
to
drink
something
that
tastes
like
cinnamon
scope
yuuuuck
drinkability
this
beer
had
like
3x
more
spice
than
the
typcial
pumpkin
ale
which
killed
the
flavor
of
the
beer
tried
several
gulps
but
ended
up
pouring
the
remainder
of
the
glass
down
the
drain
md
carbonation
is
a
little
high
but
doesnt
throw
things
off
too
much
body
is
lighter
then
it
should
be
and
comes
off
watery
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
but
it
aint
that
great
either
same
goes
with
the
beer
overall
this
might
be
passable
as
a
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
pale
yellow
and
cloudy
color
with
minimal
white
head
that
sits
on
top
at
first
smell
is
cinnamon
spices
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
it
all
hits
at
once
someone
remarked
like
he
smelled
like
cinnamon
toast
crunch
taste
is
not
that
great
when
all
the
spices
hit
you
at
once
very
watery
mouthfeelin
on
this
warmer
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
just
doesnt
leave
you
thinking
that
you
are
tasting
beer
surprised
to
see
a
harpoon
offering
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
and
in
the
mood
for
a
winter
warmer
i
eagerly
bought
a
sixer
the
brew
pours
a
clear
rusty
amber
with
a
standard
head
decent
lacing
smell
is
a
clove
punch
some
sweet
malt
elements
are
noted
the
taste
is
over
whelmed
by
the
clove
and
other
spices
there
is
no
balance
and
is
very
unpleasant
and
artificial
mouthfeel
is
slightly
sour
and
not
enjoyable
im
not
sure
what
i
am
going
to
do
with
the
remaining
4
beers
in
my
six
pack
served
a
crisp
dark
orange
with
an
instantly
diminishing
head
the
aroma
was
quite
fragrant
with
sweet
malts
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
vanilla
the
taste
was
cinnamon
and
vanilla
against
sweet
malts
decent
but
not
great
still
better
than
i
remember
it
from
last
year
the
body
was
crisp
and
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
id
likely
pass
it
over
for
something
else
as
a
longtime
fan
of
great
lakes
brewing
co
s
christmas
ale
i
had
high
expectations
for
harpoon
the
initial
flavor
screams
christmas
but
i
just
dont
love

53my
daughter
loves
this
beer
i
think
thats
because
she
lives
in
florida
and
rarely
gets
to
drink
it
its
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
small
head
a
sweet
a
lot
of
spice
and
not
much
else
this
isnt
your
usual
winter
warmer
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
brew
around
the
holidays
spicy
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
nice
medium
body
but
even
better
sweet
fruit
mainly
berry
blends
deliciously
with
fairly
intense
spices
cinnamon
but
why
i
wouldnt
even
reccomend
it
with
dessert
not
just
the
spice
i
actually
tried
this
because
a
friend
noted
how
cinnamony
it
tasted
this
observation
proved
to
be
all
too
true
it
has
such
an
overpowering
flavor
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
that
i
seriously
considered
giving
up
on
it
and
ordering
something
else
it
just
seemed
that
these
spices
were
poured
into
this
beer
with
reckless
disregard
for
the
malt
and
hops
far
beyond
the
spiciness
of
a
pumkin
ale
the
best
winter
warmers
are
characterized
by
a
subtly
of
spicing
i
would
definitely
give
it
a
try

with

thats
what
the
label
says
it
does
not

put

into
this

maybe
the
theory
was
to
just
add
spice
and
that
was
about
it
definitely
can
smell
and
feel
the
cinnamon
this
is
the
beer

into

could

this
on

much
like
earl

tea
this

batch
may
be
the
best
ive
had
but
ill
wait

i
try
some
draught
before
making

proclamation

color
with
an
unimpressive

that
leaves
no

with
some
fairly
strong
nutmeg
as
well
in
the
nose
without
much
else
present
nice
smooth
and
sweet
malty
body
carries
this
brew
with
some
subtler
than
in
past
years
spices
playing
second
fiddle
the
brew
finishes
with
a
nice
spice
flourish
that
features
more
cinnamon
than
nutmeg
but
both
are
there
in
nice
quantities
smooth
maltiness
makes
for
a
nice
mediumheavy
bodied
beer
that
is
warming
me
up
very
nicely
as
a
nightcap
ill
be
sure
to
quaff
some
more
of
this
as
the
season
goes
on
definitely
a
welcome
sign
that
winter
is
upon
us
amber
in
color
with
a
12
inch
off
white
head
smells
very
spicy
like
the
holiday
season
the
spices
are
a
bit
overpowering
in
the
beginning
but
tale
off
at
the
end
cinnomon
and
brown
sugar
are
things
that
i
taste
i
can
almost
taste
a
slight
bitterness
towards
the
end
but
it
fades
quickly
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
odd
the
spices
seem
to
be
gone
i
dont
think
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
nice
looking
light
brown
beer
with
a
small
white
head
that
left
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
was
of
my
grandmas
kitchen
before
a
holiday
all
pie
spicy
with
a
lot
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
too
much
spice
in
my
opinion
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
but
as
far
as
flavor
the
spices
seem
overdone
once
again
all
in
all
the
best
way
i
can
describe
this
beer
is
that
it
has
an
old
spice
cologne
aroma
with
a
captain
morgans
rum
aftertastefinish
if
you
are
a
fan
of
either
of
these
concoctions
go
ahead
and
try
this
beer
otherwise
stay
away
eds
note
i
found
my
notes
from
last
winters
trip
to
boston
this
is
the
first
spiced
beer
i
tasted
way
back
in
the
day
beautiful
deep
amber
color
and
head
aroma
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
light
hoppiness
this
is
a
unique
taste
among
even
other
winter
beers
the
spices
really
give
this
one
its
main
character
not
to
heavy
and
goes
down
smooth
has
an
interesting
aftertaste
though
which
sometimes
detracts
from
the
experience
had
this
on
tap
while
living
in
vermontliked
it
alot
then
bought
in
bottle
formnot
quite
as
good
on
tap
tasted
fresh
and
like
eating
a
nice
spice
cake
notes
very
drinkable
sweetness
is
not
cloying
and
spices
are
not
over
done
a
well
crafted
and
balanced
beer
a
good
pick
if
you
cant
handle
the
big
winter
brews
this
was
a
big
disapointment
since
i
so
far
have
loved
all
the
beers
ive
tried
by
harpoon
i
love
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
so
i
almost
prefered
to
smell
this
beer
rather
then
drink
it
but
that
would
be
silly
probably
one
of
the
lightest
holiday
beers
on
the
market
i
think
expectations
for
this
beer
may
have
lead
to
some
dissapointment
very
sweet
toward
the
end
just
imagine
drinking
a
cinnamon
hotball
but
without
the
hot
its
so
overspiced
that
you
cant
enjoy
the
other
characters
of
the
beer
this
beer
almost
goes
over
the
top
with
spices
but
holds
back
just
enough
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
blast
out
of
the
malt
like
they
stuffed
a
mincemeat
pie
into
the
bottle
must
be
brewed
by
little
elves
at
the
north
pole
one
bottle
at
a
sitting
is
all
i
care
for
of
this
beer
but
this
is
a
great
change
of
pace
ho
ho
ho
wow
the
brewers
raided
grannys
cinnamon
cupboard
and
went
to
town
the
spice
flavors
are
a
bit
overdone
imho
they
have
sort
of
a
superficial
presence
as
if
you
were
to
sprinkle
them
on
top
of
the
beer
rather
than
mellowing
throughout
the
brewing
process
thought
this
brew
was
a
little
thin
for
a
winter
seasonal
cinnamon
is
the
main
thing
going
here
but
not
overbearing
decent
spiced
beer
in
general
but
on
the
small
side
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
either
pretty
enjoyable
as
your
drinking
it
but
totally
forgettable
once
its
drunk
worth
a
try
but
not
really
worth
going
back
too
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
offered
but
im
not
seeking
it
out
either
taste
palate
there
is
a
mild
bready
malt
base
with
some
dry
spice
notes
like
clove
and
coriander
i
am
also
picking
up
a
touch
of
bitter
orange
peel
its
palate
feels
light
and
the
finish
is
quick
and
somewhat
boring
12
ounce
bottle
stamp
on
bottle
says
best
before
march
31
2014
got
this
bottle
from
a
friend
2
weeks
ago
so
i
didnt
get
a
chance
to
try
it
fresh
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
aroma
is
light
but
nice
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
and
toasted
malt
and
light
sweet
spices
i
think
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
the
flavors
seems
stronger
in
the
taste
as
compared
to
the
weak
aroma
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
its
not
one
of
the
better
winter
warmerspiced
ales
ive
had
its
really
low
on
the
amount
of
spicing
thats
in
this
brew
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
its
a
christmas
ale
that
doesnt
have
much
kick
to
it
maybe
ill
try
it
again
next
year
if
i
can
get
a
single
somewhere
not
overly
spicy
which
i
appreciate
good
malt
backbone
the
cinnamon
dominates
overall
wish
that
sour
note
werent
there
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
earth
and
christmas
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sweet
malt
and
christmas
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
with
decent
spice
qualities
but
nothing
stands
out
about
this
one
this
is
about
as
lackluster
of
a
winter
warmer
as
you
can
get
i
guess
it
could
be
complimented
as
being
top
notch
with
regard
to
drinkability
it
was
certainly
tasty
but
it
wasnt
because
of
what
makes
this
style
enjoyable
this
was
almost
a
simple
lager
i
would
not
get
this
again
yes
i
could
drink
this
with
any
lunch
or
meal
but
its
pretty
boring
if
youre
looking
for
a
warmer
id
like
this
for
after
working
hard
on
a
hot
day
a
drinkable
if
rather
boring
winter
warmer
the
malt
warmth
and
breadlike
qualities
are
the
high
point
for
the
flavor
yet
leaves
one
wishing
there
was
something
more
to
the
beer
to
perk
it
up
theres
some
bittersweet
interplay
going
on
too
but
doesnt
really
ignite
any
excitement
good
but
a
lackluster
offering
o
overall
unexciting
lacking
much
holiday
spirit
and
spicing
nose
is
virtually
nonexistent
flavor
is
rather
bland
unfestive
with
a
six
pack
being
a
nonrecommended
factor
falls
below
average
regards
for
me
a
snoozer
that
never
leaves
the
gate
or
defines
holiday
spirit
bah
humbug
crispness
is
foremost
in
the
feel
and
it
seems
like
its
focused
on
a
bit
too
strongly
but
theres
about
a
medium
body
to
this
beer
with
plenty
of
activity
it
fades
a
little
at
the
end
though
and
it
seems
it
just
bites
too
hard
and
may
be
covering
up
that
theres
not
much
else
to
the
mouthfeel
poured
a
light
caramel
with
decent
head
which
faded
quickly
but
left
decent
lacing
in
its
wake
the
smell
surprised
me
especially
for
a
saranac
and
for
one
that
wasnt
even
a
lager
it
smelled
almost
like
a
busch
light
wounded
soldier
from
the
night
before
or
more
like
several
all
next
to
each
other
it
tasted
only
a
little
different
better
than
mass
produced
beer
eg
busch
lite
with
some
faint
floral
and
herbal
notes
in
the
aftertaste
carbonation
was
just
enough
to
make
it
not
feel
flat
which
for
an
ale
is
one
thing
but
this
beer
quite
frankly
tastes
looks
and
smells
a
lot
more
like
a
lager
overall
i
was
very
disappointed
especially
since
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
now
dont
get
me
wrong
im
not
ranking
this
with
anhueserbusch
flagship
and
similar
products
those
i
would
never
waste
time
reviewing
or
ranking
but
this
is
in
my
opinion
a
very
disappointing
beer
look
elsewhere
for
a
winterchristmasetc
beer
nothing
about
this
beer
stood
out
and
it
really
wasnt
a
winter
warmer
to
me
but
it
still
was
above
average
id
probably
give
it
another
try
the
verdict
meh
tastes
like
a
miller
light
with
some
allspice
sprinkled
in
not
impressed
saranacs
spiced
christmas
ale
pours
a
nice
clear
caramel
color
with
very
little
head
from
a
12oz
bottle
it
has
very
little
smell
but
what
smell
there
is
pretty
generic
not
much
different
than
your
average
massproduced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
small
sharp
carbonation
taste
is
a
bit
bland
for
a
spiced
beer
but
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
that
kind
of
reminds
you
of
gingerbread
a
little
overall
its
a
fine
refreshing
ale
but
i
wouldnt
have
branded
it
as
a
spiced
christmas
product
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
brilliant
orange
color
and
a
full
pillowy
eggshellwhite
head
its
all
downhill
from
there
though
the
aroma
provides
dull
musty
hops
some
lemon
rind
maybe
some
clove
and
a
little
honeylike
sweetness
the
flavor
is
similarly
muddled
with
a
combination
of
earthy
and
peppery
hops
flavors
some
semitart
lemon
acidity
and
an
attempt
at
balance
from
some
bready
malts
the
fine
prickly
carbonation
seems
to
accentuate
the
dull
bitterness
resulting
in
the
finish
having
an
unpleasant
mild
astringency
the
bestbefore
date
on
the
bottle
is
more
than
three
months
away
but
this
beer
drinks
like
it
is
well
past
its
intended
freshness
lighter
bodied
decently
carbonated
ale
but
too
thin
still
a
good
drinkable
brew
o
this
beer
is
a
lot
lighter
in
body
compared
to
most
other
beers
in
the
winter
warmer
style
but
is
easy
to
drink
its
not
a
bad
selection
if
you
really
like
ginger
and
nutmeg
a
pretty
average
spiced
ale
here
cinnamon
clove
ginger
sweet
amber
malt
cleaner
finish
brown
sugar
sweetness
nothing
really
out
of
the
ordinary
very
well
carbonated
though
but
the
body
is
too
thin
the
ale
yeast
is
the
same
one
thats
in
so
many
saranac
beers
and
just
less
interesting
and
balanced
than
it
could
be
what
i
do
like
is
the
big
range
of
spices
its
not
simple
at
all
layers
of
herbs
and
spices
and
sugars
from
malt
to
brown
sugar
and
honey
on
par
with
some
of
the
other
large
scale
christmas
releases
a
decent
addition
to
the
winter
12er
but
i
would
not
buy
this
as
a
standalone
o
decent
winter
warmer
spices
could
be
more
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
felt
off
for
the
style
not
a
great
xmas
ale
generically
okay
it
was
in
my
mix
case
so
ill
polish
them
off
eventually
without
too
much
strain
or
maybe
one
or
two
will
still
sit
in
my
fridge
after
january
passes
if
i
cant
pawn
them
off
on
my
girlfriend
overall
not
impressed
probably
one
of
the
lightest
winter
warmers
ive
had
both
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
not
good
my
third
saranac
brew
from
this
variety
12pack
and
none
have
been
impressive
thus
far
i
dont
expect
big
things
from
the
other
three
o
inoffensive
but
hardly
anything
special
got
it
as
part
of
mixed
twelvepack
i
certainly
wouldnt
buy
it
as
a
standalone
in
a
sixpack
thats
for
sure
eh
they
could
have
changed
things
up
more
than
this
overall
a
decent
spiced
holiday
ale
nothing
super
outstanding
but
very
drinkable
a
good
holiday
party
brew
overall
the
scent
is
boring
but
the
taste
is
acceptable
an
xmas
beer
to
appeal
to
the
masses
i
suppose
not
something
id
pick
up
again
ant
spices
and
malts
on
the
nose
tend
to
step
forward
in
the
taste
momentarily
to
be
swept
away
by
an
earthy
and
bitter
hop
finale
very
light
on
the
aroma
and
a
bit
steely
faint
hint
of
cinnamonnutmeg
and
with
no
real
hop
presence
initially
emerging
faintly
with
warming
rather
neutral
in
flavor
with
fullish
pale
malts
up
front
turning
to
a
somewhat
oily
sweet
then
spicy
conclusion
notes
of
nutmeg
and
peppermint
sprinkles
linger
fairly
well
full
feel
is
pleasant
and
supportive
given
other
parameters
and
expectations
decent
balance
in
that
light
spicing
fits
a
light
bodied
brew
in
line
with
brewery
experience
in
the
end
predictably
ok
not
really
a
winter
warmer
per
se
yet
thats
as
good
as
any
other
style
bucket
for
it
notes
blah
humbug
another
disappointment
from
fx
matt
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
fair
head
and
lacing
slight
nose
of
yeast
and
spice
thin
bodied
the
taste
is
sort
of
bland
with
only
a
slight
spice
flavor
this
beer
needs
more
dark
malt
and
spice
nice
carbonation
crisp
finish
with
no
residual
aftertaste
a
good
but
noncomplex
beer
o
not
a
bad
winter
warmer
i
like
mine
tohave
a
bit
more
flavor
but
the
mild
flavor
of
this
brew
is
a
good
one
not
mild
in
a
weak
or
watered
down
way
good
malty
flavor
and
a
very
nice
blend
of
spices
not
overpowering
but
you
know
theyre
there
also
nice
to
have
a
winter
beer
that
isnt
overly
sweet
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
i
will
certainly
sample
this
beer
again
pale
yellow
copper
color
with
heavy
carbonation
and
decent
head
spicy
aroma
but
not
much
else
pretty
complex
flavor
doesnt
feel
like
it
was
designed
from
the
ground
up
but
a
base
recipe
that
was
changed
and
rebranded
you
can
definitely
notice
the
spice
the
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
however
it
feels
like
a
beer
that
you
can
have
in
quantity
and
not
get
sick
of
i
still
had
a
decent
head
at
the
finish
good
sign
smooth
finish
overall
a
tasty
and
user
friendly
spiced
ale
overall
its
a
tasty
winter
warmer
that
is
focused
on
the
spice
doesnt
overdo
itself
and
compromise
its
drinkability
o
if
rahr
labelled
this
a
porter
i
wouldnt
know
enough
to
say
different
very
thin
mouthfeel
but
in
my
opinion
must
be
enjoyed
at
6065
degrees
pours
a
beautiful
beige
thick
2
finger
head
that
stays
for
a
while
and
dissipates
into

smokey
a
bit
fatty
a
bit
spicy
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
just
carbonated
enough
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
not
something
im
telling
everyone
to
rush
out
and
search
for
but
if
it
kisses
you
on
the
lips
for
gods
sake
kiss
back
overall
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
earth
wood
and
slight
bourbon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
earth
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
wood
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
fairly
mild
bourbon
presence
all
around
overall
tasted
interesting
at
first
but
got
a
little
boring
my
son
brought
this
beer
over
for
my
dad
and
i
to
sample
and
it
was
very
good
it
had
a
dark
and
robust
flavor
and
the
company
was
great
the
company
probably
made
the
beer
better
but
i
will
drink
this
again
i
would
like
to
have
this
on
tap
before
i
really
get
sold
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
great
treat
the
beer
is
smooth
balanced
and
not
dominated
by
bourbon
and
thus
allows
for
other
flavors
to
figure
prominently
tastes
nice
and
smooth
light
finish
but
with
such
a
smooth
more
chocolatey
taste
very
easy
sipping
because
it
tastes
so
velvety
and
nice
also
with
a
bourbon
barrelflavored
mouthburn
imparts
a
chewiness
and
a
flavor
note
that
cones
off
as
sweet
black
olive
and
theres
a
vanilla
note
at
the
end
that
lends
a
fairly
satisfying
dry
sharpness
if
not
a
bit
chalky
tasting
still
a
very
solid
brew
from
a
style
a
rarely
try
and
a
texas
brewer
i
dont
often
sample
from
underrated
perhaps
lives
up
to
its
name
well
as
i
sip
this
on
a
texas
evening
with
temps
headed
into
the
low
20s
o
i
was
super
surprised
by
the
chocolate
component
on
the
palette
the
bourbon
melded
very
nicely
it
was
not
overdone
or
too
weak
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
o
a
good
brew
a
lot
like
a
scotch
with
some
more
caramel
tones
to
it
price
is
high
though
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
considering
ive
had
the
previous
two
years
releases
this
year
it
was
disappointing
to
say
the
least
the
price
skyrocketed
and
the
quality
dropped
i
would
say
try
it
on
tap
the
price
of
a
bottle
is
unjustifiable
its
very
delicious
and
deserves
to
be
enjoyed
thoroughly
this
beer
is
hellamazing
it
smells
like
scotch
seriously
i
smelled
it
and
couldnt
figure
out
how
to
describe
what
i
was
smelling
except
whiskey
its
got
a
pervasive
smoked
peat
flavour
and
a
real
whiskeylike
flavour
despite
the
relatively
low
alcohol
content
i
dont
know
how
it
attains
that
flavour
and
bite
at
under
9
abv
but
it
does
an
amazing
job
of
it
besides
the
peaty
woody
whiskey
flavour
theres
a
character
of
overall
sweetness
and
maltiness
roasted
malt
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
malt
can
be
detected
this
tastes
to
me
like
an
exceptional
scotch
ale
which
certainly
makes
a
nice
winter
warmer
in
my
opinion
very
musty
very
warm
and
overall
whiskey
flavour
yummm
pours
a
murky
dark
amber
capped
by
a
fluffy
two
finger
khaki
head
some
light
lacing
is
evident
slightly
above
average
retention
caramel
toffee
light
oaky
notes
and
some
faint
bourbon
accents
on
the
nose
caramel
almond
toffee
coconut
vanilla
some
light
cocoa
power
and
hints
of
chocolate
maltiness
finishes
with
toasted
oak
and
gentle
warm
bourbon
booziness
heavy
medium
body
to
lighter
full
body
creamy
smooth
and
silky
i
tend
to
enjoy
unspiced
more
traditonal
winter
warmers
this
brew
fits
the
bill
and
the
bourbon
barrel
is
an
added
plus
so
sad
ive
skipped
over
this
before
due
to
being
a
rahr
beer
this
beer
rules
i
got
this
on
tap
at
the
gingermans
in
fort
worth
this
might
be
what
the
greeks
were
talking
about
when
they
wrote
about
the
gods
ambrosia
if
you
have
access
to
this
hidden
gem
you
should
grab
as
much
as
you
can
find
i
hear
you
can
get
it
in
22
oz
bottles
at
central
market
in
dallas
if
you
get
a
chance
to
go
very
hearty
winter
warmer
on
the
cusp
of
porterstout
full
chocolate
and
bourbon
attack
on
the
nose
yet
sadly
not
quite
reaching
the
same
level
of
assault
on
the
tongue
however
it
is
still
worthy
of
full
recommendation
from
this
particular
reviewer
i
must
admit
to
being
a
little
biased
as
this
is
one
of
my
local
brewers
but
this
fact
notwithstanding
rahr
and
sons
has
a
great
team
and
consistently
attempt
to
push
the
boundaries
o
a
solid
bourbon
barrel
aged
ww
the
bourbon
is
definitely
more
pronounced
in
this
brew
than
alot
of
its
cohorts
the
sweet
coconuty
vanilla
notes
cut
the
alcohol
and
makes
this
beer
grow
on
you
as
you
continue
to
enjoy
it
its
definitely
a
beer
you
sip
but
is
very
acceptable
for
a
cold
winters
night
i
would
drink
it
again
but
would
not
put
a
ton
of
effort
into
finding
it
many
others
would
substitute
fine
i
didnt
review
the
2012
bottle
i
had
a
couple
weeks
ago
but
i
was
very
disappointed
with
it
after
opening
this
2010
vintage
im
even
more
disappointed
with
the
2012
ill
have
to
review
that
bottle
in
two
years
a
nice
treat
and
worth
a
try
m
full
bodied
great
mouthfeel
overall
this
was
a
fine
end
of
the
night
kind
of
beer
but
its
fairly
one
dimentional
the
base
beer
is
merely
a
vehicle
for
the
barrel
induced
flavors
and
this
falls
into
the
overly
barrel
forward
beer
category
for
me
a
bit
much
to
attempt
to
finish
a
bomber
by
yourself
o
delicious
and
strong
flavorful
packed
with
all
sorts
of
smell
and
taste
the
kind
of
beer
that
keeps
you
interested
and
develops
as
it
warms
an
all
day
drinker
for
sure
picked
this
up
at
las
colinas
beverage
in
dallas
dark
mahogany
almost
black
pour
with
one
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
with
decent
lacing
huge
bourbon
nose
with
hints
of
oak
vanilla
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
bourbon
really
dominating
again
nicely
complex
with
hints
of
raisins
oak
vanilla
maple
chocolate
and
some
subtle
black
cherries
and
butterscotch
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
albeit
a
bit
thin
at
times
with
a
gentle
boozey
warming
on
the
finish
overall
this
was
a
very
surprising
and
delicious
beer
this
is
my
first
experience
with
rahr
sons
but
definitely
not
my
last
overall
very
good
beer
for
sure
will
be
trying
to
score
a
few
more
to
see
how
they
age
and
for
regular
consuming
have
not
had
the
un
aged
winter
warmer
to
compare
but
this
is
a
delicious
beer
from
rahr
and
i
think
on
of
their
best
so
far
o
really
good
would
have
again
in
a
heartbeat
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
will
be
adding
to
seasonal
rotation
i
am
very
much
impressed
by
this
effort
from
rahr
and
hope
they
continue
to
produce
such
beers
bottle
poured
a
clear

with
a

foamy

with

of

aroma

notes
with

taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
caramelized

notes
with
light

undertones
and
some
vanilla
and
bourbon
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
brewed
with
nice
balanced
between
complexity
and
drinkability
overall
another
nice
beer
from
rahr
ive
had
the
liberty
to
try
i
enjoyed
the
nonbarrel
aged
winter
warmer
a
lot
and
dont
think
this
was
a
huge
improvement
but
i
would
like
to
do
a
side
by
to
test
this
statement
i
think
some
more
vanilla
character
would
go
a
long
way
in
helping
to
give
a
sweeter
perception
and
add
some
additional
commplexity
pours
a
dark
velvet
brown
with
a
light
head
wonderful
aroma
of
bourbon
chocolate
and
sweet
malt
oh
wow
the
first
sip
is
smooth
real
smooth
it
starts
off
with
a
light
sweet
malt
then
comes
the
rush
of
bourbon
there
is
a
light
cola
taste
and
just
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
this
is
a
little
more
thin
then
i
expected
but
it
is
unbelievably
drinkable
the
bourbon
is
not
over
the
top
and
really
balances
this
one
out
outstanding
really
cant
wait
to
get
some
of
this
again
o
cant
say
that
this
one
necessarily
improves
with
age
but
i
definitely
get
different
characteristics
if
youre
attempting
all
22oz
by
yourself
be
sure
and
break
it
up
with
water
or
a
food
pairing
so
as
to
avoid
the
oak
taste
building
up
too
much
and
becoming
overpowering
quite
a
nice
bready
beer
with
hints
of
bourbon
i
like
how
subdued
the
bourbon
is
really
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
id
get
it
again
note
this
beer
was
quite
off
putting
right
out
of
the
fridge
notable
improvement
as
the
glass
warmed
155th
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
if
carbonation
the
pleasant
and
expected
aspects
of
toasty
to
sweet
residual
maltiness
was
very
enjoyable
but
this
brew
also
includes
an
unexpected
and
not
welcomed
guest
of
acdity
there
is
a
mil
alcohol
impact
which
is
to
be
expected
of
the
style
overall
a
pretty
average
offering
i
think
there
is
some
clashing
going
on
in
this
particular
bottle
i
think
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
room
to
grow
and
ill
be
keeping
a
couple
of
bombers
to
enjoy
in
the
next
several
months
o
if
rahr
could
brew
all
their
beers
with
this
much
care
and
attention
to
detail
theyd
be
the
hottest
brewery
in
the
country
as
it
stands
this
is
something
of
an
anomaly
from
them
shared
with
my
dad
bomber
poured
into
a
red
wine
glass
yields
a
deep
earthy
brown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
leaves
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
malt
dark
fruit
molasses
and
some
woody
characteristics
nicely
done
and
a
great
aroma
for
the
season
the
taste
is
of
very
subtle
coffee
grounds
charred
flavor
transitions
to
the
sweeter
side
with
dark
fruits
molasses
a
very
light
touch
of
vanilla
subtle
barrel
characteristics
but
not
overpowering
well
done
and
very
proportionate
to
the
beer
medium
to
full
body
and
creamy
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
moderate
and
nicely
done
overall
man
oh
man
did
rahr
and
sons
really
brew
this
everything
ive
had
from
them
has
been
a
colossal
let
down
until
this
this
beer
is
absolutely
astonishing
and
tops
in
the
style
for
me
a
great
beer
that
doesnt
over
due
it
well
done
do
one
of
my
favorite
wws
definitely
better
than
their
regular
ww
which
is
still
good
just
not
outstanding
like
this
im
lucky
to
be
able
to
get
this
since
its
local
i
have
another
that
im
planning
on
saving
for
next
year
still
in
christmas
wrapping
aw
and
i
think
that
will
give
it
some
time
to
lose
the
bite
at
the
end
hope
the
final
product
is
just
that
much
smoother
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
cant
wait
to
try
one
in
another
6
months
one
of
my
favorite
styles
that
seems
to
fit
somewhere
in
between
a
big
red
big
brown
and
porter
the
bourban
and
vanilla
really
add
to
this
beer
i
was
worried
that
the
bourban
would
dominate
the
flavor
but
it
didnt
at
all
o
this
is
a
very
great
beer
by
far
the
best
one
that
rahr
makes
imo
i
am
aging
a
bottle
and
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
beer
tastes
in
a
year
overall
a
fantastic
winter
warmer
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
its
dark
i
still
prefer
others
when
comparing
it
to
winter
beers
d
big
flavors
and
abv
would
tire
easily
do
drinkability
is
moderate
i
have
to
give
rahr
credit
for
barrelaging
a
style
that
doesnt
really
have
a
rich
history
of
being
put
in
barrels
that
being
said
although
i
received
this
beer
more
warmly
after
having
a
few
sips
im
still
not
completely
sold
i
feel
the
bourbon
aspect
is
spot
on
but
it
is
still
a
bit
too
sweet
with
an
overwhelming
fruit
presence
enjoyable
but
i
could
see
this
as
being
a
beer
i
could
only
have
once
or
twice
a
year
d
when
its
winter
time
and
the
cold
wind
is
howling
and
you
are
surrounded
by
good
friends
there
are
only
a
few
brews
you
can
choose
from
if
you
want
an
epic
one
this
is
one
of
them
this
years
batch
used
jim
beam
barrels
and
it
is
wonderful
strong
warming
and
delicious
this
brew
is
a
must
try
and
youll
find
yourself
saving
some
for
aging
which
i
highly
recommend
part
two
of
the
swillfest
2011
afterparty
it
pours
a
cloudy
garnetsienna
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
whiskey
balsa
cola
vanilla
toffee
light
booze
buttery
biscuits
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
holds
notes
of
toffee
candi
sugar
light
brown
sugar
light
bourbon
and
light
oak
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
watery
syrupy
feel
overall
a
very
solid
brew
perhaps
not
as
overtly
flavorful
as
i
expected
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
especially
when
compared
to
the
horrendousness
that
preceded
it
o
traded
for
this
for
the
fact
i
liked
the
idea
of
taking
a
winter
warmer
and
putting
it
in
a
barrel
very
good
idea
very
well
done
beer
ticks
the
boxes
of
what
a
winter
warmer
is
and
the
barrel
adds
a
lot
of
complexity
to
this
almost
enhances
the
malts
even
more
very
cellar
worthy
and
i
think
might
have
smoothed
this
out
more
as
it
is
something
like
78
months
old
now
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
head
good
retention
and
decent
lace
throughout
this
one
smells
of
bourbon
hints
of
caramel
vanilla
dark
fruits
raisin
and
brown
sugar
damn
it
smells
good
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
much
of
the
same
greatness
with
a
touch
of
oak
the
dark
fruit
flavors
really
come
forward
this
beer
had
a
mediumfull
body
with
medium
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
winterwarmers
yet
im
hunting
down
more
immediately
overall
good
offering
from
rahr
this
being
the
first
beer
from
them
i
have
ever
tried
if
they
make
it
again
i
want
to
pick
up
some
bottles
for
the
cellar
next
time
i
have
had
the
kbs
stout
and
this
is
right
on
par
in
my
opinion
outstanding
stout
aged
in
whiskey
barrels
this
beer
was
almost
completely
black
even
when
held
in
the
light
strong
head
that
had
good
retention
and
held
on
for
sometime
fingers
and
lacing
were
strong
throughout
smell
was
amazing
with
the
whiskey
really
standing
out
followed
by
roast
malts
chocolate
and
some
caramel
from
the
whiskey
and
caramel
malts
i
could
not
stop
smelling
this
beer
caramel
whiskey
roast
malt
chocolate
all
hit
the
palette
in
perfect
harmony
one
not
overpowering
the
other
or
leaving
a
lasting
impression
to
deter
another
pure
and
utter
goodness
this
had
equally
impressive
mouthfeel
tantalizing
the
cheeks
and
tongue
with
perfect
carbonation
with
a
good
thick
mouthfeel
perpetuated
by
the
strong
malt
profile
this
was
one
amazing
beer
and
will
be
looking
for
it
anywhere
i
can
find
it
in
denver
overall
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
if
you
get
the
chance
to
have
it
go
for
it
drinkability
maybe
it
doesnt
get
below
zero
in
texas
but
when
you
feel
a
chill
this
will
set
you
straight
i
enjoyed
this
one
thanks
to
bgthang
for
making
this
a
part
of
a
really
cool
box
of
beer
by
far
this
is
one
of
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
dont
think
it
was
executed
the
way
it
could
have
been
4
0
d
pretty
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
lots
of
things
done
right
and
nothing
done
wrong
pours
a
very
deep
black
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
and
a
little
tiny
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
bourbon
oak
vanilla
and
chocolate
tastes
of
bourbon
oak
vanilla
chocolate
heavy
malt
body
and
some
allspice
and
hefty
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
drinkability
is
low
d
i
had
a
few
pours
of
this
and
it
went
reasonably
quickly
id
definitely
have
it
again
and
im
curious
to
see
how
much
it
varies
from
yeartoyear
as
apparently
the
barrel
source
is
always
different
its
definitely
in
the
top
5
winter
warmers
ive
ever
had
it
tastes
good
but
falls
a
little
short
of
the
aroma
the
malts
are
not
as
sweet
tasting
as
they
smell
more
of
a
bitter
note
to
them
the
bourbon
is
more
flavorful
than
hot
so
thats
a
big
plus
theres
a
little
sour
bite
in
the
aftertaste
which
doesnt
seem
right
either
but
isnt
exactly
objectionable
medium
carbonation
not
necessarily
a
sipper
as
it
goes
down
easily
glad
to
try
it
really
enjoyed
this
bottle
i
love
bottles
i
can
relax
for
2
hours
with
and
enjoy
the
whole
time
this
was
extremely
drinkable
for
a
beer
that
is
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
and
has
an
8
5
abv
excellent
job
of
doing
very
bold
flavors
without
anything
hitting
you
over
the
head
theyre
all
here
and
play
off
each
other
nicely
definitely
a
beer
that
is
best
enjoyed
over
a
long
period
of
time
on
a
cold
night
drink
is
off
the
charts
one
of
my
favorite
winter
warmers
of
all
times
im
putting
it
back
on
my
wants
list
d
this
was
quite
good
not
too
much
bourbon
flavor
but
a
nice
bal
contribution
to
it
and
good
flavors
overall
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
though
i
have
to
admit
im
just
a
bit
disappointed
not
being
a
fan
of
the
style
i
was
hoping
for
the
barrel
aging
to
bring
something
new
but
all
i
was
left
with
was
more
sweetness
and
no
grace
kudos
to
rahr
for
thinking
outside
the
box
though
d
thats
pretty
drinkable
tastes
good
nothing
too
unpleasant
good
to
drink
nice
beer
easy
drinking
and
good
flavor
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
has
turned
me
on
to
barrel
aged
stuff
the
first
34
sips
were
dare
i
say
unpleasant
but
after
that
the
bourbon
flavor
really
grew
on
me
the
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
the
beer
maybe
lighter
than
some
of
the
other
bourbon
beers
ive
had
but
still
appropriate
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
im
happy
to
have
the
full
bomber
recommended
by
friends
who
grew
up
in
texas
and
said
it
was
a
tough
to
find
brew
i
finally
found
it
at
the
hyde
park
market
at
only
11
99
for
a
650
ml
bomber
i
had
hefty
expectations
and
i
guess
it
delivered
i
didnt
expect
an
ale
to
be
so
close
to
a
porter
but
i
guess
thats
not
a
bad
thing
on
such
a
bitterly
cold
night
the
bourbon
is
much
less
apparent
than
the
boulevard
bourbon
barrel
quad
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
either
its
smooth
with
a
nice
strong
flavor
and
pours
with
a
thin
milky
head
it
leaves
an
apparent
after
taste
that
i
didnt
much
enjoy
all
in
all
its
a
good
sipper
but
dont
expect
a
belgian
quad
or
anything
of
the
sort
beer
is
medium
body
nice
oakiness
in
the
late
mouth
as
well
as
some
cherry
the
bourbon
and
sweetness
populate
the
front
half
of
the
palate
its
a
good
beer
overall
id
have
it
again
drink
again
my
boy
in
tx
always
comes
in
with
new
beers
i
have
never
heard
of
a
nice
extra
a
little
late
drinking
it
past
christmas
but
it
was
still
a
pretty
good
beer
pours
a
fairlydark
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
crimson
hue
around
the
edges
good
tan
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
a
good
dosing
of
bourbon
along
with
some
dark
fruit
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
cherry
the
taste
is
mostly
bourbon
along
with
a
bit
of
oak
and
dark
fruits
cherry
component
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
though
not
too
much
carbonation
is
fairly
low
and
theres
a
bit
of
a
twang
in
the
finish
drinkability
was
pretty
good
though
this
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
not
terribly
complex
and
something
a
bit
off
in
the
finish
it
is
safe
to
say
this
is
rahrs
finest
creation
to
date
very
rich
with
big
and
bold
woody
bourbon
flavors
while
still
having
a
certain
smoothness
on
the
mouthfeel
malts
are
integrated
well
chocolate
light
roast
and
some
caramel
sweetness
kudos
to
rahr
for
bringing
a
delicious
texasborn
barrelaged
beer
in
bottles
to
us
d
im
not
impressed
but
im
not
disappointed
im
flustered
i
wanted
this
to
be
better
it
was
my
first
encounter
with
bourbon
barreling
a
winter
warmer
it
all
has
to
do
with
the
type
of
bourbon
im
betting
the
base
beer
probably
is
an
average
example
but
the
bourbon
really
took
it
down
a
peg
overall
id
never
suggest
it
out
but
if
you
are
a
ticker
this
is
worth
the
tick
in
comparison
to
the
many
other
beers
ive
had
in
my
mind
this
is
full
bodied
with
fairly
light
carbonation
and
has
a
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
mouth
feel
and
because
the
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
darned
well
i
find
it
very
drinkable
its
nice
to
enjoy
a
beer
that
is
bourbon
barrel
aged
and
doesnt
go
over
the
top
with
it
like
i
said
before
this
is
a
very
comfortable
beer
to
sit
down
with
i
really
like
this
offering
from
rahr
this
is
an
amazing
beer
usually
bourbon
barrel
beers
let
me
down
but
this
one
hits
a
home
run
great
taste
to
it
nice
bourbon
hints
in
it
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
find
this
on
the
shelves
make
sure
you
pick
it
up
also
a
great
value
beer
it
was
only
around
10
and
was
much
better
then
boulevards
bourbon
barrel
quad
and
others
that
charge
more
drink
is
fair
the
booze
takes
a
bit
of
a
bite
with
some
warmth
lingering
taste
and
a
touch
of
a
tingle
that
is
accentuated
by
the
cinnamon
it
does
finish
a
slight
bit
sticky
too
but
not
that
bad
it
def
helps
warm
me
up
in
the
middle
of
winter
and
its
the
type
of
beer
you
want
to
drink
slowly
d
probably
rahrs
best
offering
easy
enough
to
drink
and
a
nice
change
of
styles
from
all
the
other
aged
offerings
out
there
this
beer
pours
very
dark
with
a
slight
head
the
initial
smell
revels
oak
vanilla
bourbon
and
dark
roasted
malts
the
tastepermeates
from
your
mouth
to
your
nose
the
taste
is
rich
with
all
of
the
same
nose
characters
with
a
rich
maltyness
mouth
feel
is
great
a
beer
to
sip
on
a
cold
night
not
to
be
missed
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
nice
head
and
some
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
faint
it
has
vanilla
as
the
prominent
component
some
chocolate
malts
some
bourbon
the
taste
is
fantastic
chocolate
vanilla
oak
a
little
bourbon
so
complex
and
simple
at
the
same
time
wonderful
the
mouthfeel
is
unreal
the
smoothest
cleanest
beer
that
i
have
ever
drank
perfect
carbonation
on
the
mediumlow
level
super
drinkable
a
very
awesome
beer
a
perfect
winter
warmer
it
really
reminds
me
of
an
imperial
porter
with
some
bourbon
notes
this
is
an
excellent
excellent
winter
warmer
highly
recommended
i
look
forward
to
this
release
every
year
and
now
that
its
in
bottles
i
can
keep
some
to
enjoy
for
the
next
year
they
seem
to
change
the
barrels
every
year
and
while
i
think
the
old
forrester
version
was
better
2008
this
is
definitely
better
than
the
2009
version
overall
this
is
quite
amazing
i
am
absolutely
shocked
rahr
is
known
for
mediocrity
and
this
is
far
far
from
it
i
look
forward
to
some
other
things
they
may
put
out
at
this
kind
of
quality
cheers
rahr
and
congrats
overall
the
best
made
rahr
product
and
actually
enjoyable
but
not
for
aging
at
all
probably
the
best
it
will
get
and
probably
the
best
product
that
rahr
could
ever
wish
to
make
the
flavor
doesnt
shy
away
either
bigger
chocolate
malt
profile
than
the
aroma
suggests
and
the
bourbon
courses
across
the
back
of
the
palate
with
notes
of
oak
and
vanilla
the
booze
is
evident
but
shies
away
from
becoming
too
hot
at
the
last
moment
leaving
a
smooth
finish
of
caramel
nuttiness
mouthfeel
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
fuller
in
body
but
the
carbonation
is
solid
i
mush
admit
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
about
rahr
given
their
generally
subpar
flagship
lineup
but
this
beer
is
a
barrelaged
masterpiece
overall
a
very
nice
barrel
aged
beer
probably
the
best
i
have
had
from
rahr
i
am
thinking
that
a
bigger
body
would
help
things
out
tremendously
it
just
seems
too
thin
to
me
something
i
would
recommend
and
a
good
addition
to
the
texas
beer
scene
though
i
have
had
better
barrel
aged
beers
sipping
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
the
flavors
are
many
and
good
i
had
mine
straight
out
of
the
fridge
so
it
was
cold
at
first
but
i
nursed
it
for
some
two
hours
and
got
to
enjoy
the
unfolding
notes
of
dried
fruit
cooked
sugar
a
little
cocoa
nuts
and
liqueur
this
is
not
a
spiced
beer
these
flavors
seem
to
come
out
of
the
interplay
between
the
malt
and
the
mutedbutpresent
alcohol
i
should
add
that
while
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
of
the
spectrum
this
is
not
some
syrupy
oversweet
mess
the
body
is
commensurate
with
the
type
a
strong
warming
beer
to
sip
slowly
by
the
fire
without
exceeding
the
bounds
of
taste
and
drinkability
i
was
pretty
stoked
about
this
too
as
it
seems
all
too
easy
for
breweries
to
churn
out
stickysweet
monsters
worth
more
as
symbols
of
boldness
than
as
something
you
would
actually
want
to
put
in
your
digestive
system
good
job
rahr
i
dont
like
all
your
beers
that
much
but
this
is
a
masterpiece
i
was
wanting
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
to
make
a
float
but
they
were
out
i
was
surprised
that
the
cherries
had
dissipated
to
slight
to
nonexistent
because
it
had
such
a
huge
presence
in
december
of
2009
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownred
with
a
small
tan
head
the
aroma
is
awesome
with
some
oak
vanilla
bourbon
and
a
little
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
great
as
well
with
tons
of
vanilla
and
oak
character
you
get
a
little
bourbon
and
some
spices
as
well
as
some
dark
fruit
and
some
coffee
and
roasted
malts
this
is
a
complex
masterpiece
that
is
a
great
improvement
over
the
regular
winter
warmer
from
rahr
and
sons
the
beer
has
low
carbonation
and
a
thick
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
not
that
present
in
the
flavor
but
the
alcohol
warming
affect
is
great
i
was
sitting
outside
on
the
patio
in
about
40
degree
weather
and
this
beer
warmed
me
up
nicely
i
wish
they
would
bottle
this
because
this
is
as
good
as
any
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
the
state
of
texas
nice
crimson
red
body
with
a
light
tan
head
notes
of
winter
spices
oak
vanilla
and
dark
cherry
in
the
nose
and
taste
this
beer
tastes
exactly
like
the
winter
warmer
with
an
oaky
vanilla
profile
must
be
from
the
bourbon
barrels
i
guess
thats
exactly
what
it
should
taste
like
but
i
didnt
notice
a
remarkable
difference
between
them
the
mouthfeel
was
smoother
in
this
version
with
the
vanilla
more
pronounced
its
nice
to
see
what
a
little
barrel
aging
can
do
to
a
winter
warmer
great
example
very
drinkable
i
was
told
it
was
between
811
but
it
tasted
more
like
67
very
small
nutty
character
in
the
finish
which
was
dry
for
the
style
a
treat
and
great
after
dinnerlate
night
beer
this
was
definitely
a
pleasant
surprise
a
really
great
nonhyped
barrel
aged
beer
too
bad
they
dont
release
it
in
bottles
to
the
public
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
perhaps
one
of
the
top
3
ive
ever
had
brewed
in
the
state
alcohol
content
limits
the
amount
one
could
responsible
consume
but
this
is
a
perfect
night
cap
in
my
opinion
d
great
brew
i
hope
rahr
makes
this
again
but
the
bottle
i
have
left
will
be
shared
for
a
special
ocassion
a
must
have
d
incredible
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
have
it
again
