o
didnt
like
the
aroma
at
all
but
was
a
big
fan
of
the
taste
overall
worth
a
try
but
not
something
i
will
likely
go
back
to
next
year
4
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
influence
from
the
yeast
which
makes
me
pay
so
much
attention
to
all
things
belgian
i
enjoyed
it
enough
to
leave
the
door
open
to
other
brasserie
de
cazeau
beers
very
nice
mouthfeel
first
bottle
was
off
and
flavor
profile
was
very
flat
second
was
very
nice
on
its
own
decent
balance
and
very
malty
nose
of
chocolate
and
mild
spice
some
esters
not
overpowering
recommend
serving
temperature
above
43
degrees
dark
amber
color
o
im
not
really
sure
why
this
one
gets
such
high
ratings
the
nose
is
very
bland
and
the
taste
is
oddly
out
of
whack
for
the
style
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
ale
is
doing
nothing
for
me
still
its
drinkable
ill
give
it
that
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
impressive
offering
it
has
been
cellared
for
a
few
months
and
could
hold
up
much
longer
definitely
my
favorite
from
cazeau
so
far
d
this
beer
has
all
of
the
elements
that
one
needs
in
a
dark
belgian
ale
but
somehow
it
just
doesnt
quite
come
together
the
way
it
should
it
has
a
spicy
character
to
the
yeast
profile
that
goes
a
bit
over
the
top
and
fails
to
merge
with
the
dark
sugar
and
subtle
fruit
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brownish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
candy
sugar
and
spice
especially
cinnamon
in
the
taste
licorice
with
a
mellow
spiciness
but
cinnamon
stands
out
a
spice
like
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
cinnamon
and
candy
sugar
like
aftertaste
the
licorice
was
a
sleeper
nice
but
just
above
average
o
looks
and
feels
fantastic
smells
and
tastes
good
too
i
liked
this
better
than
the
river
horse
belgian
freeze
o
wow
picked
this
beer
up
at
half
price
but
would
have
paid
full
price
excellent
dark
belgium
beer
very
well
balanced
brew
and
easily
drinkable
since
this
review
i
have
seen
and
had
this
beer
again
on
tap
at
teresas
wayne
pa
jan
12
dm
crisp
and
refreshing
considering
the
weight
of
the
beer
and
very
bubbly
very
drinkable
considering
the
alcohol

what
comes
to

at

when
i
take
my
first
drink
followed
by
other
dark

some
chocolate
spice
and
some
hop
bitterness
ends
with
some
dryness
not
so
sure
i
woul
call
this
a
saison
as
it
is
classified
as
it
doesnt
really
fit
that
description
drinkability
another
slow
sipping
belgian
christmas
beer
that
fits
the
season
not
overly
exciting
but
decent
d
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
goes
down
easily
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
none
of
the
flavors
are
overpowering
jd
this
is
a
good
kerst
ale
defined
by
nice
charred
malt
flavors
it
has
pilsener
munich
cara
60
and
150
and
black
malts
not
too
sweet
moderate
in
body
a
bit
hoppy
it
has
tomahwk
styrian
goldings
and
cascade
hops
and
nicely
spiced
it
is
very
well
balanced
last
years
tournay
de
noel
has
become
the
tournay
noire
belgian
stout
which
is
now
made
year
round
the
2010
version
is
a
new
tournay
de
noel
recipe
the
alcohol
level
is
moderate
and
together
with
the
interesting
flavors
it
is
a
very
drinkable
kerst
ale
d
nice
beer
all
around
very
french
feel
to
this
beer
at
times
the
yeast
is
mild
here
good
taste
an
enjoyable
effort
first
noel
ive
had
in
the
last
few
weeks
that
has
a
picture
perfect
belgian
head
nice
tight
small
bubble
of
a
mocha
head
on
a
cloudy
mahogany
brown
at
first
i
noticed
dark
fruit
particularly
black
currant
and
black
berry
as
it
expands
the
nose
is
belgian
sugar
and
lemon
zest
with
hints
of
malt
characteristics
which
definitely
come
out
in
the
palate
a
nice
chocolate
with
a
quality
black
berry
that
is
quite
prominent
a
tad
toasty
and
a
tad
spiced
make
it
a
very
well
balanced
brew
completely
sustainable
abv
not
boozy
a
hint
of
hay
munich
malt
bitter
drinkability
is
pretty
nice
but
a
touch
too
bitter
to
get
a
higher
rating
if
you
have
someone
who
digs
gin
tonics
you
might
shock
them
with
how
much
they
enjoy
this
dark
beer
d
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
d
great
to
sip
nice
homely
and
warming
beer
have
had
better
but
this
is
still
a
very
tasty
very
easy
to
appreciate
belgian
brunedark
ale
nice
d
a
nice
christmas
beer
worth
seeking
out
id
like
to
find
it
in
a
larger
bottle
and
store
it
for
a
year
or
two
overall
its
really
quite
nice
its
rich
and
flavorful
but
not
overdone
absolutely
worth
trying
pours
quite
dark
thinner
tannish
head
pretty
thick
flavor
profile
with
a
good
bit
of
spices
in
there
as
well
robust
and
hearty
a
bit
heavy
for
july
christmas
beers
in
july
so
not
so
much
a
session
ale
but
its
nice
enough
i
suppose
probably
better
to
sample
in
colder
months
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
super
good
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
belgian
malt
with
some
dry
and
grainy
ester
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
spice
cake
with
notes
of
unrefined
grainy
malt
and
a
dry
malt
base
a
bit
more
sweetness
would
have
benefited
this
beer
imho
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
overall
i
might
actually
prefer
this
to
the
much
higher
acclaimed
tripel
this
beer
was
very
much
tostyle
and
was
fantastically
brewed
this
one
tastes
a
lot
like
trois
pistoles
o
an
average
dark
ale
at
best
id
probably
give
this
another
try
but
if
theres
a
sour
ontap
im
going
for
that
0
another
nice
brew
from
brugge
not
my
personal
favorite
from
them
but
i
liked
it
for
a
style
that
i
am
always
hit
or
miss
on
poured
near
black
with
a
good
offwhitelight
tan
head
and
some
good
lacing
the
nice
brought
a
bit
of
yeast
plus
a
large
amount
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
mostly
all
roast
with
some
light
darkfruit
character
interesting
but
not
all
that
enjoyable
there
was
some
creaminess
to
the
feel
though
mostly
dry
roast
overall
this
was
far
too
dominated
by
bitter
roasted
malt
not
bad
at
all
and
definitely
a
belgianstyle
brew
with
character
overall
this
seemed
to
be
infected
but
even
through
the
offflavors
it
seemed
to
be
a
onedimensional
beer
d
what
do
you
do
when
you
have
a
750ml
and
a
mediocre
beer
pour
it
drinks
very
wellsmooth
with
no
overpowering
booze
flavor
i
had
this
in
broad
ripple
indiana
this
was
served
black
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fizzled
down
to
a
white
lace
around
the
glass
it
smells
of
hints
of
fruit
and
roasted
malts
tastes
slightly
roasted
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
fruit
very
drinkable
dark
brown
with
rosewood
highlights
and
a
dark
sand
colored
head
that
settles
nicely
to
a
dense
fizz
leaving
sliding
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
nice
and
complex
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
with
oaky
vanilla
and
just
a
whiff
of
something
like
olive
brine
nice
roasted
maltiness
with
semisweet
chocolate
belgian
yeast
and
raisin
with
a
charred
bitterness
in
the
finish
chalky
medium
mouthfeel
a
fine
ale
not
lazy
to
add
same
yeast
to
a
different
grain
bill
but
the
yeast
could
perhaps
get
more
out
of
a
deeper
malt
profile
this
one
is
sweet
with
a
bitterness
but
lacking
in
midrange
roasting
depth
caramel
even
a
little
lager
character
vienna
munich
mmm
would
go
a
long
way
touch
of
blackcurrant
at
the
finish
md
medium
bodied
with
a
very
vigorous
carbonation
very
lively
on
the
tongue
overall
a
good
feel
but
the
taste
just
is
not
very
good
which
bring
the
drinkability
down
a
few
notches
the
body
is
limited
a
bit
wispy
and
limited
in
the
finish
the
carbonation
is
limited
as
well
overall
a
beer
that
doesnt
quite
fit
style
but
overall
would
like
a
bit
more
depth
tastes
as
it
smells
medium
strength
blend
belgian
flavors
cohering
into
something
akin
to
a
fruit
and
bread
basket
with
earthen
undertones
not
quite
the
full
package
that
i
look
for
in
a
nice
solid
belgian
but
for
a
midwestern
attempt
a
belgian
its
pretty
good
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
not
quite
black
but
very
dark
its
very
hard
to
tell
the
difference
once
its
in
a
glass
but
as
you
pour
the
color
is
easier
to
judge
the
head
is
incredibly
big
i
mean
3
inches
or
so
and
very
fluffy
cavernous
rocky
kindof
a
tan
color
it
moves
around
collapses
a
bit
really
looks
nice
the
smell
has
a
bit
of
easters
kind
of
some
dark
fruits
plums
cherries
etc
maybe
a
tiny
bit
of
tartness
then
theres
a
nice
chocolatey
smell
mixed
in
with
a
tiny
bit
of
grassiness
overall
though
the
smell
kind
of
lacks
the
depth
that
the
taste
has
but
the
smell
is
still
pretty
good
when
i
taste
it
i
first
get
this
creamy
chocolate
syrup
kind
of
taste
really
nice
but
that
sort
of
fades
back
into
a
kind
of
deep
leafy
earthy
tobacco
flavor
there
a
nice
caramelly
flavor
like
cola
but
its
missing
some
roastiness
im
pretty
sure
theres
something
other
than
malted
barley
in
here
just
from
the
taste
there
are
so
many
different
bready
grainy
flavors
in
here
though
it
kind
of
lacks
a
bready
density
the
cocoa
returns
in
the
finish
the
body
i
think
meets
my
expectation
but
i
wish
it
were
fuller
the
carbonation
is
a
little
prickly
too
and
the
rush
of
bubbles
makes
the
slightly
thin
body
a
bit
more
obvious
still
i
think
it
fits
the
style
to
some
degree
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
lots
of
depth
but
nothing
offensive
the
carbonation
slowed
me
down
a
bit
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
i
think
the
abv
here
might
slow
me
down
in
a
bit
but
at
this
point
everything
is
going
smoothly
definitely
a
nice
belgian
dark
a
bit
more
body
would
really
make
this
impressive
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
black
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
ok
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
grapes
plums
raisins
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
sour
apple
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
theres
bittersweet
chocolate
bread
dark
fruit
yeast
and
tart
apples
that
are
noticable
in
this
brew
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
i
liked
it
this
is
the
first
brugge
beer
ive
tried
and
ill
definitely
have
to
try
their
other
ones
now
mfd
i
have
never
had
a
world
class
belgian
dark
ale
but
i
do
not
imagine
that
it
would
be
this
carbonated
though
i
can
imagine
the
body
being
about
this
thickness
i
am
a
big
fan
of
brugge
but
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
its
a
decent
beer
that
is
complex
enough
i
would
be
willing
to
try
again
much
more
sour
than
expected
from
a
belgian
dark
two
fingers
of
even
tan
foam
head
has
nice
retention
leaving
almost
no
lace
as
it
slowly
fades
body
holds
very
true
to
the
beers
name
and
is
a
stout
like
blackness
bose
shows
a
evident
use
of
a
yeast
strain
with
a
belgian
feel
some
mineral
based
malt
and
dark
fruit
are
on
the
nose
also
a
big
dose
of
yeasty
bready
darkness
enters
the
mouth
with
first
sip
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
tartness
that
rides
on
the
back
of
a
dry
consistant
bitter
feel
that
carries
this
brew
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
unique
combination
adds
a
crispness
to
the
mouthfeel
while
having
a
nice
dry
bitter
darkness
throughout
super
smooth
and
oh
so
easy
to
drink
i
would
guess
the
alchol
to
be
around
6
or
7
this
brew
is
much
better
on
tap
i
must
say
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
draft
in
snifter
at
brewpub
poured
hazy
brown
color
with
an
average
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
mostly
lasted
with
good
lacing
moderate
toasted
sweet
malty
and
small
alcohol
aroma
medium
body
with
a
slick
texture
medium
spicy
sweet
flavor
with
a
medium
sweet
finish
of
moderate
duration
complex
drinkable
brew
really
disappointed
with
this
one
i
just
couldnt
get
over
that
weird
ashy
taste
at
least
i
got
this
badass
bottle
md
surprisingly
light
bodied
and
some
carbonation
ive
had
this
on
tap
before
and
it
was
much
better
than
in
the
bottle
head
went
away
pretty
quick
like
the
trippel
de
ripple
flavor
was
rather
sour
but
really
good
and
refreshing
for
this
type
of
brew
rather
light
bodied
but
not
bad
i
also
tried
this
one
on
tap
at
shallos
a
good
beer
you
should
try
one
one
for
size
goes
well
with
beck
odelay
for
music
d
not
a
bad
black
ale
just
not
all
that
it
could
be
could
serve
as
a
gateway
beer
into
sour
ales
though
this
beer
had
a
nice
dark
body
but
with
little
head
and
little
lacing
it
had
a
very
sweetmalty
aroma
with
chocolate
hints
the
taste
was
great
it
had
a
nice
malthop
balance
with
a
wonderful
smoky
flavor
and
tastes
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
in
the
finish
its
a
little
rough
but
goes
down
fine
overall
very
unique
and
very
enjoyable
but
one
glass
is
all
i
could
drink
in
a
sitting
was
very
lightbodied
in
the
mouthfeel
which
added
to
the
drinkability
with
the
ineresting
flavors
great
brew
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
to
the
other
side
of
town
i
could
see
myself
having
several
a
very
well
balanced
black
beer
sweet
and
not
hoppy
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
certain
hop
or
barley
but
it
was
smooth
and
drinkable
for
anyone
pretty
powerful
stuff
that
is
very
drinkable
watch
out
i
highly
recommend
brugge
brasserie
to
anyone
on
a
brewpubgastropub
hunt
in
indianapolis
a
good
beer
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
but
this
really
just
makes
it
go
down
even
quicker
very
drinkable
this
one
tastes
and
feels
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
at
least
to
me
i
like
it
a
lot
surprized
to
find
this
on
tap
at
fiddlers
hearth
in
south
bend
last
night
i
didnt
even
know
brugge
shipped
their
beer
anywhere
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
not
much
of
a
head
opaque
and
murky
brown
smelled
of
belgian
spices
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
flavor
was
malty
sweet
and
with
a
bit
of
ethanol
plums
and
bananas
swimming
around
in
the
background
nice
body
good
for
the
style
hits
you
harder
than
you
expect
it
to
i
would
recommend
this
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
brugge
brasserie
d
this
beer
had
a
pretty
soft
smell
and
a
thin
flavor
that
was
a
bit
underwhelming
the
flavors
that
were
there
were
nice
but
it
didnt
have
much
depth
or
character
d
this
is
my
goto
beer
at
the
brugge
if
theyre
out
of
the
tripel
a
showcase
of
teds
talent
finishes
strongly
on
licorice
characteristics
and
a
smooth
sensuous
candied
darkness
damned
good
drinkability
was
excellent
indy
folks
are
lucky
with
this
new
brewpub
served
in
a
large
sniftertype
glass
love
the
proper
glassware
at
brugge
pitch
black
no
highlights
at
simply
black
thick
tan
head
on
top
stands
for
quite
some
time
leaving
behind
some
great
patterns
of
lace
nose
is
spicy
licorice
and
yeasty
sweet
canid
sugar
flavor
combined
with
licorice
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
coffee
finishes
sweet
this
beer
became
even
more
wonderful
as
it
warmed
and
the
coffeechocolate
flavors
come
out
medium
body
carbonation
fairly
low
makes
this
even
better
solid
last
swigs
black
is
a
meld
of
many
but
falls
short
of
something
if
this
went
in
a
direction
of
coffee
or
roasty
or
anise
then
this
would
be
impressive
otherwise
it
reminds
me
of
a
beer
on
the
doorstep
of
fantôme
oddly
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
murky
complexion
theres
a
trace
of
beige
head
mostly
present
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
and
barely
elsewhere
the
aroma
is
rather
off
putting
with
loads
of
malt
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
packed
with
loads
of
malt
and
the
alcohol
is
detectable
the
mouth
is
sticky
and
chewy
a
little
too
sweet
upfront
and
a
lingering
aftertaste
but
not
terrible
and
very
strong
id
have
it
again
if
this
is
a
belgian
im
a
martian
could
be
a
really
nice
beer
but
that
metallictangy
character
kills
it
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
and
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
honey
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
and
not
all
that
bad
for
what
it
is
clear
amber
pour
with
a
dark
ruby
hue
weak
head
and
lacing
the
nose
is
of
malt
against
a
strong
alcohol
background
medium
body
with
a
smooth
texture
low
carbonation
level
the
flavor
profile
is
two
dimensional
caramel
malt
sweetness
over
a
strong
alcohol
background
the
hop
level
is
so
low
its
almost
undetectable
as
it
warms
and
the
palate
becomes
accustomed
to
the
alcohol
the
sweetness
comes
forward
on
the
finish
it
flows
from
sweetness
to
an
alcoholic
aftertaste
a
good
but
not
great
beer
more
hops
and
dark
malt
would
improve
this
one
a
great
deal
it
is
the
best
beer
i
ever
tried
the
only
problem
it
is
hard
to
find
it
in
boston
area
i
agree
that
it
would
be
useful
to
have
expiration
date
but
based
on
my
experience
in
our
local
store
winchester
wine
and
spirits
winchester
ma
you
should
buy
all
what
you
see
i
remember
they
got
20
bottles
and
i
how
stupide
of
me
bought
only
six
i
came
next
saturday
and
they
were
already
sold
out
now
i
have
to
wait
till
they
get
another
shipment
not
very
drinkable
a
waste
at
any
price
personal
rate
2
75
overall
if
not
for
the
alcohol
bite
i
would
probably
like
this
very
much
not
so
good
i
found
all
of
these
lithuanian
beers
at
a
really
low
price
so
i
had
to
pick
them
up
but
none
of
theme
have
been
anything
special
they
are
all
really
high
abv
too
o
i
have
realized
over
time
that
this
company
makes
a
lot
of
coin
off
high
alcohol
content
beers
maybe
the
fact
that
i
was
paying
three
bucks
should
have
tipped
me
off
and
although
this
isnt
worse
than
before
after
its
still
extremely
difficult
to
get
through
a
bottle
o
there
are
few
beers
that
i
refuse
to
finish
until
it
warms
otherwise
it
is
unbearable
overall
3
5
this
beer
sat
in
the
cool
temperature
of
my
basement
for
over
a
year
before
i
tried
it
so
that
may
explain
why
my
review
is
so
wildly
different
from
others
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
has
a
depth
of
flavor
and
aroma
that
sets
it
apart
from
many
other
beers
i
never
tasted
the
high
alcohol
content
everything
was
smooth
and
enjoyable
i
did
however
notice
a
large
amount
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
which
is
a
result
of
the
beer
aging
in
the
bottle
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
absolutely
no
lacing
smells
like
what
you
would
imagine
an
artificial
lager
syrup
smelling
like
incredibly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
lot
of
cheap
alcohol
leaves
a
metallic
aftertaste
overall
about
on
the
equivalent
of
any
generic
malt
liquor
in
the
states
absolutely
nothing
about
this
is
belgian
in
style
drinkable
but
only
for
a
purpose
other
than
enjoyment
overall
listen
for
under
four
bucks
this
beer
was
a
steal
i
have
paid
more
for
much
crappier
belgian
style
beers
and
this
will
leave
you
with
a
smile
i
hope
you
enjoy
and
appreciate
it
as
much
as
i
have
salud
o
a
belgian
dark
ale
meh
i
guess
not
really
sure
what
the
brewery
was
trying
to
accomplish
with
this
one
i
have
another
bottle
which
of
course
i
will
drink
very
light
amber
color
with
no
visible
head
upon
pouring
the
beer
had
absolutely
no
ribboning
it
was
very
sweet
overall
not
a
horrible
brew
but
not
one
of
the
best
either
the
bottle
appearance
is
unique
with
the
half
wolf
label
the
high
alcohol
content
is
a
nice
feature
overall
this
is
a
big
bottle
full
of
crap
there
is
nothing
to
recommend
this
beer
at
all
avoid
overall
very
interesting
and
thought
provoking
taste
which
in
itself
is
also
pretty
good
good
brew
overall
overall
not
sure
what
to
call
this
there
is
nothing
belgian
about
this
so
it
may
be
miscategorized
it
is
strong
ale
but
if
anything
it
most
closely
resembles
an
english
barleywine
interesting
and
not
without
its
charms
o
a
great
beer
for
october
but
make
sure
to
inhale
as
you
drink
as
over
half
of
the
flavor
comes
in
through
the
nose
very
sweet
beer
interesting
in
character
o
overall
really
didnt
care
for
this
beer
at
all
so
many
hell
average
examples
of
this
style
not
this
junk
still
go
lithuania
appearance
is
very
red
smelled
of
maple
syrup
the
taste
was
overly
sweet
with
fruit
it
was
slightly
acidic
it
didnt
seem
like
it
was
high
in
alcohol
but
it
gave
me
a
headache
after
drinking
half
of
the
bottle
very
bad
to
average
beer
i
will
never
try
this
beer
again
period
not
a
bad
beer
cant
taste
the
alcohol
much
was
disapointed
on
the
suds
not
much
abd
they
faded
quick
color
is
very
red
and
you
can
see
through
it
but
its
kinda
foggy
though
no
sediment
tastes
very
fruity
tangy
a
little
different
then
some
beers
tasts
of
possibly
sour
apples
medium
thickness
on
the
mouth
feel
leaves
you
a
little
tart
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
brownish
amber
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
alcohol
some
fruits
taste
is
alcohol
up
front
some
fruits
and
malts
not
overly
flavorful
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
great
no
cant
see
myself
trying
to
drink
this
one
again
drinkability
slightly
better
than
the
aforementioned
brew
but
not
good
enough
to
recommend
to
anyone
sorry
i
wasted
the
money
on
this
one
but
now
i
know
taste
is
much
better
but
not
enough
to
save
it
it
is
spiceysweet
fruit
juice
raisin
a
hint
of
toast
and
cheap
brandy
it
is
lightly
sweet
with
hint
of
faint
spicey
bitterness
underneath
it
is
simple
but
tastes
reasonably
good
but
in
the
end
is
mostly
fermented
alcoholic
fruit
juice
and
fails
to
maintain
any
interest
in
the
face
of
the
offputting
aroma
it
is
also
very
heavy
for
what
you
get
drinkability
thus
fades
fast
a
true
oddity
or
maybe
a
new
strain
of
belgian
beer
yeast
mixed
with
lithuanian
rocket
fuel
it
seems
clean
enough
so
maybe
the
brewers
meant
for
it
to
taste
like
this
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
not
one
id
really
revisit
but
it
was
ok
not
sure
what
style
this
is
like
most
here
quite
a
unique
brew
overall
the
main
reason
to
drink
this
beer
is
to
say
you
drank
a
beer
called
werewolf
and
not
only
that
it
has
a
rather
high
abv
8
2
so
you
wont
be
having
to
toss
down
that
many
to
get
your
howl
on
damn
i
think
they
should
hire
me
for
their
marketing
department
dont
be
afraid
to
get
bit
by
this
werewolf
i
hear
drinking
coors
light
silver
bullet
after
drinking
werewolf
can
kill
you
d
despite
the
generally
unimpressive
characteristics
this
is
a
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
the
unsettling
aromas
disappear
quickly
with
the
head
and
the
flavor
while
forgettable
is
not
offensive
overall
while
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
is
easy
enough
to
drink
that
i
will
still
enjoy
it
3
5
overall
a
weird
malty
beer
that
is
quite
repulsive
it
was
quite
cheap
but
it
is
still
quite
nasty
i
might
be
able
to
finish
this
but
it
will
be
a
struggle
drinkability
is
ok
the
flavors
are
decent
i
just
wish
there
was
more
carbonation
my
expectations
werent
high
but
this
limboed
right
under
them
nonetheless
not
great
for
sure
any
time
the
words
synthetic
and
mess
appear
in
a
review
you
know
its
not
good
overall
at
2
50
for
16oz
i
got
my
money
out
of
it
i
knew
it
wouldnt
be
any
good
based
on
its
origin
i
should
have
trusted
my
instincts
and
avoided
the
beast
overall
im
shocked
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
more
of
this
beer
the
brew
had
a
sweet
scent
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
aroma
the
beer
had
a
flavor
of
caramel
and
alcohol
the
body
was
thin
and
sticky
drinkabilty
was
ok
but
i
might
have
to
try
it
again
to
get
a
handle
on
it
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
different
than
most
any
other
beer
ive
tried
certainly
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
i
think
this
loses
points
in
some
score
because
no
one
really
knows
how
to
classify
it
and
it
seems
some
people
want
more
alcohol
in
the
flavor
i
think
wellmasked
is
a
good
thing
and
ive
certainly
had
worse
than
this
its
an
aboveaverage
brew
d
just
okay
not
a
favorite
of
mine
reddish
orange
body
topped
by
a
moderate
head
of
cream
foam
comprises
of
a
balanced
mix
of
fine
and
coarse
bubbles
aroma
not
much
there
but
what
is
present
reminds
me
of
a
slight
buttermilk
note
flavor
is
mostly
malt
up
front
with
some
dark
fruit
exactly
what
id
expect
from
this
type
of
beer
just
a
little
restrained
tastes
remarkably
like
a
lighter
flavored
corsendonk
christmas
ale
a
slight
medicinal
bitterness
gradually
arises
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeel
is
very
good
with
a
slight
silkiness
that
is
lifted
from
the
palate
by
the
fine
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
there
are
too
many
really
good
beers
to
have
this
one
very
often
but
hey
how
many
lithuanian
beers
are
you
going
to
find
in
the
states
id
love
to
taste
this
in
its
home
country
i
can
only
imagine
the
abuse
it
has
taken
before
getting
to
me
via
a
store
in
tn
if
you
are
a
fan
of
high
alcohol
sugar
bombs
this
ones
for
you
i
could
not
even
finish
a
glass
overall
this
isnt
very
taste
but
i
cant
believe
its
got
8
2
abv
you
wouldnt
think
it
for
a
second
if
you
just
want
to
drink
something
watery
and
get
cracked
this
is
the
beer
for
you
eh
not
expecting
too
much
out
of
this
one
since
i
design
things
for
a
living
the
label
was
pretty
corny
so
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
a
great
brew
overall
it
hid
the
8
5
alchohol
well
dont
think
i
am
going
to
be
buying
this
one
again
not
horrible
okay
beer
for
just
drinking
maybe
a
good
dry
dish
would
be
good
drink
okay
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
this
just
not
that
good
a
beer
or
a
representation
of
the
style
i
am
happy
that
i
had
a
better
experience
than
some
prior
reviewers
beware
the
werewolf
drainpour
this
is
actually
quite
smooth
and
pleasant
to
drink
figs
raisins
brown
sugar
caramel
and
burnt
toast
come
to
mind
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
the
baltic
nations
it
is
a
bit
thin
and
not
overly
complex
but
it
is
not
lacking
in
flavors
and
the
8
2
is
well
hidden
as
is
warms
though
it
does
get
a
bit
rougher
around
the
edges
and
mildly
boozy
i
am
thinking
this
bottle
probably
has
about
a
year
of
age
on
it
and
seems
to
have
done
it
some
good
however
it
does
not
taste
like
it
would
age
for
more
than
a
couple
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
would
buy
it
again
for
sure
pours
a
cream
threefinger
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
almost
clear
redamber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
malty
nose
flavor
is
caramel
and
toffee
higher
abv
is
hidden
4
50
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
actually
the
beer
tastes
like
someone
took
a
quad
and
mixed
it
with
a
skunked
and
crappy
pilsner
honey
amber
with
a
fine
patchy
white
head
that
leaves
fine
lace
behind
bubblegum
toffee
and
fusel
alcohol
sweet
and
malty
with
an
herbal
hop
twang
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
finishes
hot
while
it
doesnt
measure
up
to
the
style
are
we
sure
this
is
a
belgian
style
ale
it
is
unique
worth
a
try
taste
is
thick
dry
tart
sour
malt
grain
some
citrus
and
some
caramel
ends
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
typically
medium
and
the
taste
is
outrageously
sweet
it
was
like
drinking
caramel
swirl
ice
cream
if
you
like
it
sweet
you
will
probably
like
this
but
if
you
are
a
hops
or
alcohol
fan
you
might
find
it
a
bit
too
much
to
bear
with
the
high
alcohol
content
and
flat
taste
i
dont
see
this
being
much
for
a
session
i
might
drink
this
again
if
i
were
strapped
for
cash
only
2
for
the
1
09
pint
bottle
but
otherwise
id
steer
clear
of
it
drinkability
never
again
im
not
sure
i
would
classify
this
as
a
belgian
dark
there
is
a
sweet
malt
characteristic
however
the
appearance
is
more
of
a
strong
ale
and
the
taste
profile
is
more
of
a
lager
nikki
ok
so
i
went
to
maine
and
found
this
oddity
from
lithuania
and
had
to
buy
one
out
of
the
bottle
this
belgian
style
dark
ale
was
a
murky
amber
color
with
a
frothy
tan
head
moderate
retention
and
some
les
than
impressive
lacing
the
aroma
was
musty
malt
slightly
stale
hop
bitterness
and
hints
of
sweetness
in
the
alcohol
esters
the
flavors
started
a
little
on
the
musty
barley
side
this
then
gave
way
to
sweeter
flavors
of
caramel
malt
but
these
too
were
a
little
odd
the
aftertaste
however
was
distinctly
unpleasant
like
tannins
in
wine
twiggy
the
body
was
medium
and
watery
the
carbonation
too
soft
and
as
it
warmed
up
the
alcohol
came
right
through
it
i
have
trouble
classifying
it
as
a
belgian
dark
ale
and
really
would
not
recommend
anyone
try
it
even
for
the
novelty
too
bad
this
is
very
drinkable
keeping
in
mind
the
8abv
not
sure
what
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
perhaps
a
vienna
lager
lithuanian
amber
ill
buy
it
again
tm
all
i
get
on
the
taste
is
a
wave
of
caramelized
malts
with
the
smallest
dash
of
earthy
hops
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
with
a
heavy
dosing
of
malts
as
the
nose
suggests
as
the
beer
warms
i
taste
some
apple
cider
belgian
candied
sugars
and
small
qualities
of
tea
light
carbonation
and
almost
watery
in
spots
yet
syrupy
in
the
middle
odd
i
know
overall
not
a
very
common
feeling
mouthfeel
rather
strange
to
my
foreign
tongue
not
refreshing
with
the
long
wet
finish
pronounced
by
the
lack
of
bitterness
and
dryness
drinkable
yes
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
c
rating
given
was
a
bit
of
a
gift
because
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
this
country
aroma
is
sharp
and
malty
with
an
undertone
of
apple
cider
color
is
a
clear
light
mahogany
and
it
pours
with
a
somewhat
thick
head
that
sticks
around
flavor
is
rather
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
has
an
undertone
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
apple
texture
is
smooth
and
crisp
and
aftertaste
has
both
ciderlike
sweetness
and
hoppy
bitterness
in
it
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
spicy
the
malt
is
deep
and
inviting
the
taste
is
sweet
and
smooth
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
pleasantly
surprised
snifter
slightly
hazy
amber
color
orange
to
red
some
sediment
slight
offwhite
head
low
retention
and
light
lacing
sweet
malty
aroma
very
barleywineesque
some
decent
citrus
hop
aromas
big
banana
flavors
with
some
clove
good
amount
of
alcohol
burn
sweet
malts
with
tons
of
fruits
a
little
rough
at
8
but
other
than
that
it
is
a
pretty
good
brew
for
lithuania
the
tagline
for
werewolf
is
you
must
be
sure
you
wanna
taste
it
i
wasnt
sure
at
all
and
now
im
sorry
i
did
this
is
ghastly
fleabitten
bayingatthemoon
beer
if
you
dare
make
sure
youve
had
your
rabies
shots
d
drinkability
for
this
is
good
for
the
style
i
believe
but
also
fairly
strong
in
alcohol
it
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
and
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
is
pretty
good
i
dont
think
it
is
a
beer
meant
to
be
a
session
beer
but
one
to
be
savored
worth
a
try
okay
to
be
honesti
bought
this
for
the
label
which
is
a
picture
of
half
a
woman
and
half
a
wolfand
underneath
it
says
you
must
be
sure
you
wanna
taste
it
they
meant
it
this
dark
ale
im
not
sure
if
that
is
what
it
says
90
of
the
label
is
in
lithuanian
im
guessingis
just
not
for
me
it
is
not
horrible
by
any
meansbut
it
is
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
either
o
decent
flavor
im
not
sure
what
caused
the
foamover
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
infection
this
is
a
good
light
fruity
dark
beer
pleasant
but
not
spectacular
good
for
pairing
with
food
had
this
with

this
is
a
medium

with

carbonation
quite
malty
with
lots
of

i
wasnt

blown
away
as
i
have
been
with
other
de
struise
brews
a
nice
belgian
ale
but
it
doesnt
reach
the
same
highs
of
pannepot
and
struises
other
beers
overall
interesting
brew
just
for
the
fact
that
it
seems
so
ordinary
when
it
comes
from
an
extraordinary
brewery
once
again
im
glad
i
could
give
it
a

notes
good
though
not
great
beer
that
was
enjoyable
complex
and
fairly

the
flavors
didnt
pop
but
rather
provide
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
it
but
probably
wouldnt
get
it
due
to
the
price
bottle

with
a
prickly

a

all
and
all
a
somewhat
bland
belgian
dark
decent
but
not
a
particularly
engaging
or
memorable
example
of
the
style
also
quite
drinkable
good
balance

to
mask
any
residual

with
a
big
frothy

with
notes
of
coffee
vanilla
and
a
certain
grape
element
feel
is
on
the
thin
side
for
a
larger
beer
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
no
extreme
flavors
ensures
i
wont
get
tired
of
this
one
fans
of
belgian
beers
and
de
struise
in
particular
are
encouraged
to
try
this
beer
d
i
was
curious
as
to
what
this
one
would
bring
and
i
did
enjoy
it
it
seemed
sort
of
like
a
belgian
take
on
an
american
redamber
ale
on
draught
at
upstanding
establishment
nice
pour
in
a
tulip
glass
leaving
plenty
o
room
for
a
large
head
to
roost
on
top
straight
amber
in
color
i
would
call
this
a
belgian
amber
rather
than
a
belgian
dark
ale
its
not
particularly
dark
in
color
or
flavor
moving
on
nice
malty
aroma
very
subtle
hoppage
earthy
nice
round
flavor
to
this
signature
struise
fruityness
and
mild
sweetness
pretty
malty
with
a
slight
earthy
funk
not
sour
smooth
on
the
palate
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
ale
from
de
struise
not
an
over
the
top
flavor
assault
like
many
of
their
others
which
i
love
just
a
nice
belgian
amber
a
decent
drinkability
with
light
bitterness
a
decent
dry
finish
and
very
light
boozy
taste
the
flavor
is
very
lightly
sweet
up
front
but
has
a
firm
bitterness
to
it
that
nicely
balances
other
flavors
of
red
table
grapes
and
currants
are
balanced
by
a
touch
of
herbal
hop
character
this
beer
is
quite
nice
i
like
that
it
is
dry
overall
this
makes
for
an
appetizing
light
beer
that
has
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
seems
like
it
is
more
from
fruit
notes
than
a
sugar
sweetness
if
that
makes
sense
the
flavor
also
has
that
touch
of
mustiness
and
funky
ripe
cheese
this
is
a
very
nice
complex
beer
and
i
am
really
digging
the
complexity
that
the
little
touch
of
open
fermentation
gives
this
beer
d
this
is
a
solid
de
struise
brew
and
i
would
seek
it
out
again
d
a
very
solid
belgian
dark
ale
i
felt
like
i
could
drink
this
all
day
would
like
to
try
again
one
of
the
worst
de
struise
beers
not
worth
getting
or
trading
for
next
time
i
will
buy
me
some
more
bottle
poured
a
medium
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
great
lacing
aroma
is
a
mix
of
caramel
and
light
spices
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
caramel
malt
with
light
spices
and
limited
sweetness
body
is
average
with
great
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
even
close
to
the
best
i
tasted
from
this
brewery
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
alcohol
with
some
cherries
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
with
a
little
tartness
and
some
malt
notes
there
is
also
a
little
brown
sugar
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
taste
is
slightly
sour
cherry
and
malt
up
front
with
almost
a
dr
pepper
like
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
an
ever
so
slight
warming
alcohol
presence
towards
the
end
highly
drinkable
with
its
light
mouthfeel
i
will
most
likely
seek
this
out
in
the
future
i
would
not
have
guessed
this
to
be
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
hey
what
can
i
say
nice
pretty
deep
amber
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
very
decent
head
smells
of
hops
but
not
the
overpowering
kind
which
was
a
nice
surprise
some
spicy
yeasty
oders
in
there
as
well
and
pale
malts
very
clean
tasting
with
an
english
biscuity
malt
flavor
not
sure
if
that
makes
sense
but
thats
what
i
wrote
and
some
zest
possibly
from
the
yeast
lighter
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
the
hops
are
held
at
bay
and
a
nice
clean
palate
is
left
nothing
special
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
drink
more
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
a
pretty
tasty
little
beer
nothing
over
powering
and
nothing
really
sticks
out
at
me
i
would
drink
this
again
d
a
12oz
bottle
was
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
have
another
bottle
any
time
soon
one
of
struises
less
interesting
offerings
highly
drinkable
beer
there
is
a
lot
here
but
its
not
heavy
and
you
could
easily
pound
down
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
off
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
cap
smells
of
bready
malt
floral
hops
and
spicy
yeast
sweet
dark

come
to
the
surface
as
she
warms
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
and
dark
fruits
up
front
hops
and
yeast
gang
up
and
overpower
the
malt
for
a
half
a
second
then
the
sweet
candy
cherry
and
plum
flavors
win
out
long
lingering
sweetness
after
each
sip
high
level
of
carbonation
medium
body
sweet
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
if
it
wasnt
so
difficult
to
obtain
i
might
enjoy
these
more
often
wow
this
is
the
perfect
example
of
a
beer
whose
total
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
incredibly
balance
of
fruit
both
high
and
low
the
low
individual
rating
do
it
no
justice
but
i
cant
give
it
a
5
as
an
overall
to
balance
its
real
value
shame
a
decent
strong
belgianstyled
dark
ale
the
fruitiness
well
rendered
and
weirdly
balanced
even
though
there
seems
to
be
little
present
in
the
way
of
natural
offsets
anyway
this
is
rather
agreeable
and
nicely
warming
in
my
veins
as
opposed
to
in
my
gullet
always
a
plus
ok
beer
but
a
slight
let
down
somethings
not
quite
doing
it
for
me
perhaps
one
of
the
more
expensive
brews
in
my
advent
calendar
and
with
it
not
bringing
up
the
average
its
a
little
disappointing
interesting
beer
poured
perhaps
a
touch
cold
with
a
small
to
medium
sized
creamcolored
head
that
soon
settles
to
some
swirls
and
a
ring
with
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
brown
amber
opaque
in
the
wider
parts
of
the
glass
aroma
is
a
muted
combo
of
malt
fruit
apricots
plums
yeast
wine
flavor
is
a
blend
of
those
qualities
with
interesting
interplay
between
sweet
and
carbonic
tang
being
slightly
more
dominant
than
bitter
very
rich
body
is
big
but
the
sweet
tang
and
bitter
create
high
points
that
along
with
its
richness
make
it
a
little
overpowering
carbonation
is
good
taken
alone
finish
is
medium
in
length
no
alcohol
warmth
one
and
done
a
delicious
beer
throughout
for
an
effortless
nightcap
of
sweetness
elegance
and
masculinity
overall
this
one
took
a
few
sips
to
get
used
too
a
little
strange
overall
and
definitly
unique
d
for
a
strong
borderline
sour
belgianish
beer
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
the
fruit
and
light
sourness
go
well
together
while
the
sugar
keeps
it
balanced
and
prevents
the
tartness
from
dominating

this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
nice
light
tan

as
the
head
settles
the
lacing
sticks
really
well
to
the

some
sweet

a
bit
of
yeast
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
lightly
toasted
with
some
dark
fruity
flavors
the
flavors
are
very
good
in
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
isnt
overly
heavy
and
has
a
pretty
good
carbonation
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
it
isnt
as
full
bodied
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
this
is
a
good
beer
i
will
have
it
again
d
a
nice
drinker
plenty
of
flavourbut
it
doesnt
seem
as
strong
as
it
is
interesting
beer
not
sure
its
something
id
want
to
order
all
the
time
but
the
glass
i
had
at
maxs
was
enjoyable
drinkability
good
this
beer
reminded
my
of
a
mild
flanders
red
that
was
more
balanced
and
less
tart
drinkability
an
unusual
beer
hard
to
classify
or
describe
the
beer
pours
a
brownishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
and
caramel
malts
the
flavor
is
similar
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
to
go
with
the
toffee
there
is
also
some
brown
sugar
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
malty
aroma
and
flavor
raisons
and
other
dark

a
little

pricey
but
worth
it

of
lightly
sweet
caramel
malt
with
huge
caramel
malt
presence
with
just
the
right
amount
of
residual

taste
is
also
a
strange
mix
between
some
caramel
malt
with
a
right
balance
of
residual
sugar
with
a
light
hoppy
finish
and
some
dry
figs
and
plums
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
hard
to
categorize
but
well
worth
drinking
d
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
one
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
more
of
a
dark
amber
colored
beer
leaning
into
brown
territory
the
head
doesnt
stay
up
very
long
but
granted
i
was
drinking
from
a
5
5
ounce
glass
an
interesting
beer
i
get
a
little
plum
and
some
aspects
that
id
find
in
the
sauce
of
kung
pao
chicken
taste
is
interesting
as
well
theres
the
plum
again
but
its
light
and
theres
also
some
roastiness
going
on
like
a
belgian
darkstout
mix
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
which
was
a
little
surprising
worth
a
go
sure
give
it
a
chance
this
is
a
brownishamber
brew
the
head
is
thick
and
densely
packed
the
aroma
has
a
distinctly
smoky
malt
scent
complete
with
a
little
toast
some
yeast
and
a
lot
of
spicy
peppery
smells
plenty
of
tobacco
aromas
the
taste
is
semisweet
with
a
caramel
and
yeast
flavor
theres
a
variety
of
malt
flavors
from
pale
to
some
moderatelyheavy
roast
tastes
the
finish
is
a
little
abrupt
medium
body
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
that

way

beer
overall
i
guess
i
am
not
much
of
a
fan
of
gruut
beers
this
one
had
promise
but
feel
flat
on
the
body
and
finish
medium
bodied
and
rich
enough
to
carry
the
sweetness
without
turning
the
beer
into
a
sickly
mess
my
sweet
tooth
loved
it
i
even
bought
a
bottle
to
bring
home
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
clear
copperamber
pour
with
a
half
finger
head
that
quickly
fades
with
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
somewhat
subdued
but
very
unique
as
expected
very
herbal
and
flowery
with
hints
of
honey
cinnamon
caramel
and
butterscotch
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
similar
unique
herbal
character
hints
of
honey
butterscotch
caramel
nutmeg
and
some
other
flavors
that
i
just
cant
describe
im
a
hop
head
but
im
not
missing
the
hops
at
all
here
the
uniqueness
makes
up
for
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
winter
warmer
or
christmas
beer
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
and
syrupy
but
really
smooth
and
drinkable
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
ive
visited
the
brewery
in
ghent
and
this
holds
up
to
the
draft
version
ill
be
in
ghent
this
weekend
and
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
overall
far
from
the
best
of
this
style
it
is
seriously
lacking
in
flavour
not
a
particular
taste
persay
but
a
boldness
or
strength
that
one
normally
finds
in
a
belgian
beer
d
i
prefer
the
amber
ale
over
the
blonde
and
bruin
for
drinkability
a
little
high
in
carbonation
but
a
pretty
good
beer
good
beer
enjoyable
o
for
beers
made
with
spices
i
dont
taste
it
in
al
the
beers
gruut
was
not
only
to
spice
the
beers
but
to
conserve
it
to
but
the
spices
are
in
all
the
beers
not
in
the
taste
this
brewery
is
definitely
worth
visiting
if
youre
in
gent
but
not
necessarily
worth
taking
some
home
i
did
not
like
the
fact
that
it
gushed
but
it
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
otherwise
d
drinks
easily
enough
to
merit
a
good
score
if
other
options
are
available
i
would
choose
to
move
on
to
something
else
after
having
one
of
these
on
any
given
night
but
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
another
bottle
next
week
if
the
price
was
right
a
decent
brew
for
sure
a
very
odd
notion
this
one
a
belgian
amber
sweetish
with
apricot
fruitiness
notes
of
burnt
caramel
and
woodyherbal
notes
very
complex
with
some
offputting
from
the
herbal
side
maintains
a
balance
that
keeps
it
from
being
poorly
made
and
it
is
quite
good
and
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
an
american
amber
by
any
means
gruut
is
a
category
is
it
not
one
of
the
few
examples
and
not
a
bad
one
tastes
sweet
and
of
roasted
malt
with
a
mix
of
wheat
hops
sugar
spices
some
fruits
and
herbs
nice
warm
complex
flavors
with
the
yeast
and
malt
being
the
strongest
tastes
and
a
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
just
not
anything
exceptional
in
the
flavor
department
especially
for
a
belgian
product
it
was
quite
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
ive
come
to
expect
a
lot
from
belgian
products
and
this
beer
just
seemed
average
and
average
by
global
standards
not
just
belgium
i
will
be
buying
more
overall
a
descent
beer
but
not
a
great
one
but
certainly
worth
a
try
mouthfeeldrinkability
just
when
i
thought
the
perfect
mouthfeel
of
a
belgian
ale
was
locked
up
with
tripel
karmeliet
this
beer
dazzles
with
a
sublime
gentle
texture
that
lasts
throughout
the
entire
duration
in
the
mouth
absolute
perfection
it
further
emphasizes
the
already
impressive
quality
of
the
beer
a
relatively
elusive
musttry
for
belgian
ale
lovers
until
today
when
i
gave
the
label
a
close
look
and
saw
hops
listed
among
the
ingredients
i
thought
this
ale
was
a
gruit
if
it
wasnt
for
a
modest
hop
bitterness
it
would
be
belgian
ambers
rarely
impress
me
as
much
as
belgian
pales
and
darks
gruut
belgian
amber
ale
does
nothing
to
change
that
gruut
belgian
amber
ale
is
a
hazy
well
amber
ale
with
a
thin
dense
light
beige
head
that
leaves
incredible
sheets
of
lacing
it
smells
very
raisiny
sweet
with
possibly
some
dark
fruit
theres
a
note
of
black
pepper
in
the
nose
its
medium
bodied
reasonably
smooth
and
quite
bubbly
the
finish
is
a
bit
ragged
it
tastes
pretty
mellow
it
starts
off
fruity
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
tart
then
it
becomes
phenolic
and
alcoholic
it
leaves
the
mouth
hot
the
bitterness
is
present
but
lowkey
its
good
but
its
nothing
standout
it
tastes
stronger
than
it
is
a
bit
much
for
a
session
ale
d
starts
strong
appearance
wise
but
only
goes
down
hill
from
there
lackluster
aroma
moderate
flavor
and
disappointing
mouthful
makes
this
a
one
try
only
dont
waste
your
money
on
a
sixpack
nice
amber
color
with
a
fine
bubbled
head
that
trails
globs
of
lace
yeasty
smell
with
a
solid
caramel
malt
background
taste
is
also
very
yeasty
some
chalkyness
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
on
the
toungue
finishes
yeasty
overall
an
ok
beer
but
it
never
really
shows
much
flavor
other
than
yeasty
but
it
never
shows
any
fruityness
that
you
would
expect
definitely
dont
be
expecting
a
belgian
if
you
buy
this
beer
d
a
pretty
tasty
amber
which
was
relatively
easy
to
drink
for
a
6
6
ale
i
give
it
a
very
good
drinkability
overall
and
it
is
simple
which
sometimes
just
hits
the
spot
pours
a
three
finger
pourous
spongey
tan
head
not
much
stickage
or
retention
and
no
bubbling
ok
tarnished
amber
color
toasted
bread
with
a
dash
of
cinnamon
cardomon
and
nutmeg
make
up
the
spicey
aroma
toated
sweet
bread
drizzled
with
a
little
caramel
starts
the
taste
off
right
then
some
chammomile
and
some
fruit
cake
spices
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
tinny
bandaids
dry
malty
and
spicey
palate
but
a
little
off
on
the
finish
and
linger
this
one
has
potential
which
i
dont
feel
has
been
realised
yet
easydrinking
and
substantial
abv
wellmasked
but
not
too
much
to
differentiate
itself
from
others
on
the
market
blah
this
beer
is
a
mess
aroma
was
very
weak
smelled
like
stale
ginger
ale
pour
was
absolutely
beautiful
deep
rich
amber
with
a
2
finger
off
white
head
taste
was
stale
caramel
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
very
thin
and
watery
carbonation
left
the
beer
halfway
through
and
turned
into
a
flat
amber
ale
pours
a
dark
yellowishbrown
brown
copper
color
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
musky
aroma
that
is
dominated
by
clove
spiciness
slight
chocolate
malt
presence
flavor
is
once
again
dominated
by
cloves
a
little
bit
of
licorice
chocolate
malt
very
carbonated
with
a
spicy
roastiness
up
front
followed
by
a
sweet
malty
center
and
dry
finish
drinkability
not
offensive
but
pretty
average
truth
be
told
there
are
some
decent
flavors
here
but
a
few
notes
that
while
not
off
notes
arent
too
hot
alcohol
is
fine
6
6
isnt
a
problem
but
nonetheless
still
just
a
fairly
average
beer
t
m
d
fairly
nondescript
toasty
malts
sweetness
again
inoffensive
a
medium
body
sparkling
carbonation
and
fairly
easy
drinking
rather
straight
forward
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
nice
loose
offwhite
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
as
it
dissipated
the
aroma
is
disappointing
for
a
belgian
brew
it
has
a
light
lemony
tea
quality
and
that
is
about
it
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
tea
like
flavor
with
a
hint
of
a
burnt
caramel
malt
an
light
earthy
hop
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
candi
sugar
the
feel
is
fairly
light
and
crisp
and
very
well
carbonated
burns
the
tongue
a
bit
the
brew
finishes
astringent
and
a
touch
bitter
not
really
what
i
expected
a
belgian
made
brew
that
resembles
an
american
style
flavors
are
not
bad
but
the
carbonation
is
over
the
top
drinkability
this
would
score
higher
without
that
yeasty
weirdness
but
this
is
still
a
solid
and
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
drink
another
of
if
given
the
opportunity
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
thin
crème
head
nose
is
onesided
with
mostly
leafy
caramelized
sugars
evident
flavor
is
earthy
and
leafy
with
a
noticed
sweet
tone
when
i
saw
that
it
said
belgian
amber
ale
on
the
label
i
had
low
hopes
but
this
is
ending
up
pretty
decent
really
theres
a
good
enough
balance
of
earthy
tones
and
sweetness
feel
is
fairly
full
on
the
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
well
bodied
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
a
belgian
amber
ale
sure
it
definitely
comes
off
as
a
hybrid
of
sorts
with
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
i
say
its
worth
a
shot

with

about

are
both
decent
enough
the
brew
smells
like
nuts
dark
fruit
cloves
and
a
bit

taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
brown
sugar
and
molasses
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
got
this
one
as
a
single
from
one
of
my
friends
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
regardless
if
this
a
brown
ale
or
a
belgian
dark
ale
i
like
other
beers
of
each
style
better
if
i
see
this
beer
again
ill
get
it
the
taste
as
with
the
scent
was
a
struggle
as
well
hints
of
maple
syrup
light
doses
of
malt
and
a
tinge
of
sweetness
accented
a
rather
boring
experience
i
tackled
this
with
a
clean
palate
and
high
expectations
but
i
was
left
quite
flat
highly
drinkable
and
with
a
great
mouth
feel
good
option
for
who
wants
to
try
something
different
and
flavorful
but
not
as
intense
as
some
belgian
ales
and
that
is
a
unique
personality
o
considering
the
low
abv
and
how
smooth
this
brew
drinks
it
is
a
candidate
as
a
session
ale
a
nice
taste
that
i
believe
could
serve
as
gateway
for
those
afraid
of
a
dark
brew
highly
enjoyable
o
not
objectionable
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
to
have
again
very
decent
like
it
more
as
i
get
thru
the
glass
rjt
overall
an
excellent
beer
with
some
great
flavor
and
drinkability
if
youre
looking
for
a
tasty
brown
ale
this
would
be
one
of
my
top
recommendations
o
awesome
beer
and
my
first
belgian
dark
ale
its
easy
going
and
a
great
example
of
what
a
great
malt
profile
tastes
like
id
suggest
this
to
those
that
are
getting
into
beer
as
a
novice
and
want
to
know
what
these
beer
snobs
mean
when
they
say
malty
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
belgian
like
dark
fruits
and
a
nice
roasted
malt
in
the
taste
a
small
bite
light
dark
fruits
and
a
small
spice
a
small
spice
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
caramel
roast
and
note
of
spice
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
thin
and
faint
but
decent
o
very
enjoyable
could
easily
see
having
several
of
these
without
even
thinking
about
it
pretty
well
balanced
even
without
a
noticeable
hop
fingerprint
upon
pouring
the
colour
was
rich
and
amber
with
little
to
no
head
i
was
concerned
that
maybe
the
quality
had
been
compromised
however
to
my
surprise
the
flavour
was
complex
and
bold
quite
smokey
and
very
smooth
going
down
a
top
quality
ale
i
highly
recommend
o
my
go
to
brown
ale
and
the
only
one
produced
in
holland
that
i
know
of
notes
top
to
bottom
its
very
drinkable
and
rather
good
for
a
cold
night
cheers
overall
not
totally
disastrous
but
pretty
rough
ill
probably
have
a
few
more
drinks
but
finishing
the
bottle
isnt
likely
overall
to
style
im
rating
this
as
a
belgian
dark
ale
or
a
dubbel
at
the
very
least
its
kind
of
flat
on
the
tongue
and
lacks
depth
the
carbonation
is
also
a
bit
off
in
my
opinion
still
a
great
beer
and
in
my
opinion
very
sessionable
pours
a
rich
ruby
brown

a
frothy

the

chocolate
funky
belgian

a

sure
what
i
think
of
it
as
a
dark
belgian
though
definitely
has
the
belgian
yeast
funk
but
really
drinks
like
a
brown
ale
good
stuff
though

notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
dark
semiopaque
amber
light
tan
head
no
lacing
mild
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
some
dark
fruit
flavor
of
sweet
and
light
toasted
malt
dark
fruit
a
bit
of
nuts
light
but
pleasant
flavors
nice
bosch
label
maybe
worth
another
try
for
the
label
and
maltiness
o
a
completely
underwhelming
and
forgettable
beer
overall
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
simple
belgian
dark
great
for
a
session
ale
and
quite
enjoyable
would
pair
well
with
grilled
pork
and
seasoned
vegetables
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
i
could
easily
see
this
being
a
session
beer
if
it
was
more
readily
available
this
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
not
being
too
sweet
considering
the
lack
of
bitterness
overall
this
beer
was
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
the
flavors
were
all
good
but
it
would
be
hard
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
o
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
slight
amount
of
sweetness
which
shared
some
similarities
with
a
dubbel
but
isnt
quite
as
strong
in
terms
of
aromas
and
flavors
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
it
could
make
for
a
pleasant
after
dinner
drink
othis
is
pretty
good
best
brown
i
have
had
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
pretty
good
o
ill
admit
i
bought
this
one
for
the
label
but
im
very
glad
i
did
what
a
nice
sessionable
dark
belgian
from
holland
drinkability
though
it
is
not
spectacular
it
is
a
good
beer
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
o
really
well
put
together
thoroughly
enjoyable
seems
firmly
planted
in
between
an
english
brown
and
a
belgian
dark
and
thats
just
fine
drinkability
is
good
recommended
overall
it
is
qualified
as
a
dark
belgian
and
the
herbal
notes
and
earthy
hops
make
a
case
for
this
however
there
is
so
much
bread
and
caramel
malt
that
it
is
very
much
trying
to
be
a
brown
no
matter
how
confused
this
beer
might
be
it
cant
help
but
be
incredibly
drinkable
overall
a
really
good
recommendation
from
the
beer
guy
at
sydneys
you
never
know
what
treasures
youll
find
here
another
strong
contender
to
my
brown
ale
list
rich
robust
and
smooth
drinking
pours
a
nice
clear
brownish
color
with
a
tanmocha
head
the
retention
is
pretty
low
though
the
smell
is
nutty
and
malty
feel
is
medium
to
light
taste
is
good
enough
i
get
a
bunch
of
malts
some
caramel
and
toffee
a
little
nutty
flavor
and
some
bitterness
at
the
end
note
nothing
overpowering
i
also
get
a
little
metallic
taste
at
the
end
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
too
memorable
either
o
interesting
how
something
that
should
taste
overly
sweet
comes
across
pleasantly
wellbalanced
straightforward
and
distinctively
belgian
version
of
english
brown
ale
style
as
for
the
beer
this
is
a
nice
smooth
brown
ale
very
drinkable
but
certainly
not
a
big
beer
i
got
very
little
head
or
lacing
slightly
sweet
and
malty
this
could
definitely
be
a
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
close
to
medium
but
pleasant
enough
for
those
who
prefer
malt
flavors
over
hops
try
this
out
one
of
the
tastier
brown
ales
ive
tried
overall
perhaps
ive
been
spoiled
by
some
of
the
great
beers
of
belgium
and
the
netherlands
but
i
just
feel
like
there
could
be
a
little
more
complexity
in
this
beers
flavor
that
said
i
still
think
it
is
very
tasty
and
could
gladly
quaff
liters
of
it
if
given
the
chance
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
tan
foamy
head
that
retains
well
and
laces
nicely
the
aroma
is
bready
with
a
slight
amount
of
caramel
notes
the
flavors
starts
caramel
sweet
and
then
finishes
with
a
bready
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
undercarbonated
and
empty
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
messed
up
artwork
though
overall
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
this
is
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
brown
ale
good
flavor
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
daily
appears
a
cola
colored
brown
ale
with
a
large
off
white
khaki
brown
head
fine
even
lacing
aroma
is
full
of
caramel
and
brown
dark
roasted
malt
character
flavor
is
full
of
caramel
roasted
brown
malts
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
a
dominant
sweet
malt
character
with
underlying
herbal
euro
hops
backing
it
up
mouthfeel
is
even
bodied
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
especially
for
a
brown
ale
with
a
bit
of
a
cloying
sweetness
as
a
whole
overall
i
cant
believe
this
is
from
koningshoeven
damn
tasty
brown
ale
this
is
not
your
standard
brown
ale
like
the
label
may
indicate
definitely
has
the
profile
of
a
belgianstyle
brown
and
does
it
well
d
very
interesting
and
very
nice
i
would
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
looking
for
something
that
is
decidedly
different
o
this
is
amazingly
complex
for
being
5
ill
certainly
revisit
this
in
the
future
its
a
flavorful
yet
light
beer
final
notes
this
beer
could
almost
act
as
a
winechampagne
replacement
its
got
a
unique
yet
very
appetizing
character
all
its
own
i
really
like
it
drinkability
not
like
i
remembered
it
i
used
to
rave
about
this
beer
but
with
the
price
having
gone
up
so
much
in
the
past
two
years
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
plenty
of
sugar
to
the
taste
strong
light
molasses
flavor
low
carbonation
to
the
otherwise
quite
rich
body
theres
a
nuttiness
to
the
taste
a
little
bit
like
frangelica
smooth
to
the
swallow
but
its
short
lived
d
very
drinkable
a
nice
clean
brown
ale
goes
down
way
too
easy
has
the
flavor
of
a
much
bigger
brew
dangerously
drinkable
extra
points
for
the
awesome
and
surreal
bosch
artwork
on
the
bottle
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
this
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
and
amber
color
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
of
caramel
and
malt
very
sweet
the
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
nose
lots
of
malty
caramel
flavor
but
not
so
sweet
as
to
be
disgusting
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
leaves
a
nice
coating
on
your
tongue
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
almost
reminds
me
of
some
german
styles
my
friend
suggested
the
tilburgs
dutch
brown
ale
to
me
while
we
were
at
a
bar
i
was
a
little
hesitant
because
i
dont
typically
go
for
darker
beers
but
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
wow
i
was
blown
away
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
it
was
dark
but
it
didnt
taste
like
a
dark
beer
the
color
is
just
a
few
shades
lighter
than
molasses
it
was
very
smooth
and
had
subtle
notes
for
chocolate
the
beer
just
takes
over
your
taste
buds
with
heavenly
delight
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
notes
great
belgianstyle
dubbellike
ale
with
relatively
low
alcohol
dark
amberbrown
and
clear
copious
small
carbonation
light
khaki
colored
head
with
excellent
retention
mild
latte
like
aroma
more
milk
than
coffee
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
soft
up
front
some
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
a
mildly
cloying
finish
needs
to
warm
up
a
bit
to
bring
out
the
subtleties
medium

enjoy
the
beer
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
tannish
head
retreats
rather
quickly
with
nice
stickiness
and
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
the
first
taste
malty
and
sweet
with
some
toasted
notes
and
toffee
great
beer
a
little
sweet
but
smooth
and
tastey
overall
a
decent
belgian
dark
i
personally
weigh
on
the
side
that
this
brew
does
qualify
as
belgian
dark
but
there
are
certainly
english
characteristics
to
this
brew
as
well
flavorful
lower
abv
makes
this
one
i
could
happily
drink
throughout
the
evening
nothing
i
havent
seen
before
but
well
made
nonetheless
nice
like
this
one
worth
trying
atmosphere
is
pretty
decent
nice
tone
with
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
a
head
nose
has
a
similar
characteristic
pretty
nice
nothing
special
flavor
has
a
nice
balance
of
light
malt
light
hop
and
light
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
i
drank
this
outside
on
a
warm
night
and
it
was
a
perfect
sipping
beer
i
could
have
this
for
dessert
after
every
meal
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
i
loved
the
bosch
character
on
the
tap
handle
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
this
is
still
outclassed
by
the
best
of
this
style
this
is
definately
an
easydrinking
belgian
the
low
alcohol
and
easy
mouthfeel
makes
it
a
session
beer
of
great
character
and
flavor
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
but
flavorful
nice
drink
d
delicious
well
made
beer
by
the
trappists
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
its
hard
to
find
a
belgian
style
beer
with
this
low
alcohol
and
having
this
great
a
flavour
which
means
a
definite
repurchase
is
in
order
value
1
99
for
a
single
ehhh
a
little
too
bland
to
justify
that
price
tag
the
name
fooled
me
this
is
not
a
true
brown
ale
it
is
just
as
beeradvocate
names
it
belgian
dark
ale
do
it
you
are
looking
for
a
brown
ale
this
is
not
it
but
it
is
a
very
pleasant
drink
give
this
i
try
lots
of
flavor
it
is
worth
a
try
this
one
is
for
the
simple
folks
that
just
want
a
rich
tasting
brown
ale
without
complexity
very
enjoyable
i
am
curious
at
the
label
of
being
a
belgian
dark
ale
when
this
is
very
much
in
the
style
of
english
browns
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
cheers
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
beer
was
a
drain
pour
i
was
expecting
a
nice
sweet
brown
ale
however
this
tasted
nothing
like
that
i
am
not
going
to
even
waste
my
time
reviewing
this
beer
if
someone
ever
orders
one
i
may
have
to
sample
it
to
see
if
mine
was
bad
but
otherwise
i
dont
anticipate
picking
this
up
again
i
love
sweet
beers
but
this
was
just
a
watery
brown
ale
i
dont
know
what
exactly
those
freaky
deaky
dutch
do
to
their
brown
ales
but
i
sure
as
hell
like
it
this
variation
seemed
to
possess
a
little
more
depth
and
complexity
than
what
you
typically
find
in
your
run
of
the
mill
english
offering
it
was
more
refined
well
whatever
the
word
suffice
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
tilburgs
plenty
and
would
certainly
revisit
on
tap
at
chancey
smiths
deep
murky
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
off
white
cap
nose
of
burnt
brown
sugar
caramel
malts
toasted
bread
crust
a
bit
of
spice
tastes
sweet
probably
overly
so
of
brown
sugar
caramel
toasty
malts
and
rye
bread
a
bit
of
spice
and
sweet
vanilla
comes
out
at
the
finish
overall
good
but
too
sweet
for
me
and
probably
a
bit
too
sweet
for
a
brown
ale
due
to
belgian
candy
sugars
ok
smooth
silky
mouthfeel
nice
texture
slight
sweetness
is
pleasant
and
never
cloying
brown
sugar
and
molasses
some
candied
cherry
there
is
an
even
balance
to
this
offering
and
enough
acidity
to
make
it
interesting
some
dark
fruit
weighs
in
nicely
bitterness
mostly
in
the
swallow
and
the
finish
just
about
right
id
say
all
around
a
nice
brown
and
well
worth
a
try
a
tasty
fruity
brown
ale
funny
how
a
wellmade
example
of
the
style
increases
ones
appreciation
of
it
i
dont
really
know
where
the
ba
classification
of
this
beer
comes
from
unless
the
beer
has
changed
recipes
over
time
d
more
of
an
english
brown
than
a
belgian
dark
in
my
book
certainly
enjoyable
enough
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
md
light
body
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
i
can
imagine
sucking
back
this
entire
4pack
in
one
sitting
drinkability
not
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
worth
a
try
though
fairly
sessionable
overall
didnt
particularly
like
this
and
i
wouldnt
expect
to
drink
it
again
it
is
light
and
thin
so
you
could
session
with
it
but
there
are
lots
of
better
options
if
thats
what
youre
after
d
too
sweet
to
be
consumed
frequently
but
i
still
think
it
is
very
interesting
and
quite
enjoyable
there
is
some
cane
sugar
dark
fruits
and
sweet
bread
in
the
tastes
but
it
is
mostly
dominated
by
burnt
milk
chocolate
and
smoked
hops
there
is
a
pungent
sour
cherry
taste
that
rounds
out
the
thin
bodys
lack
of
yeast
drinkability
just
a
strange
yet
simple
beer
that
i
would
rather
not
have
again
d
big
time
drinkability
and
in
my
opinion
decently
blanced
enough
for
year
round
enjoyment
probably
food
friendly
too
the
beer
is
very
sweet
with
loads
of
candied
sugars
a
nice
caramel
maltiness
some
roasted
notes
some
chocolatey
flavors
too
the
beer
is
just
very
light
very
drinkable
quite
smooth
but
not
creamy
whats
not
to
like
in
this
beer
it
is
a
belgian
dark
ale
for
those
who
dont
want
the
outrageous
abv
but
appreciate
the
caramels
the
yeastiness
and
the
candied
sugars
poured
from
bottle
into
balloon
glass
poured
a
nice
dark
chocolate
brown
with
full
fine
head
smelled
of
caramel
raisins
dark
fruits
and
malt
hint
of
chocolate
and
toffee
at
the
finish
good
carbonation
allowed
head
to
stick
around
nicely
throughout
the
glass
and
left
some
good
lacing
this
is
an
amazing
light
smooth
drinking
beer
for
a
belgian
dark
ale
this
is
on
the
soft
side
of
the
style
and
could
use
a
little
more
body
the
mouthfeel
was
good
from
the
carbonation
stand
point
but
lacked
a
bit
in
overall
flavor
overal
a
decent
brew
representing
the
style
nicely
its
an
easy
drinker
as
well
with
a
lower
abv
making
this
a
good
sessionable
belgian
most
belgians
seem
to
run
on
the
high
side
for
abv
but
this
one
could
be
had
at
a
pub
and
still
allow
you
to
drive
home
d
great
logo
not
so
great
beer
i
could
see
this
being
in
the
likes
of
a
session
as
it
is
drinkable
but
in
a
weak
way
i
prefer
flavor
over
consumption
values
i
can
safely
say
that
this
will
never
grace
the
walls
of
my
fridge
or
glass
for
that
matter
again
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
well
worth
trying
if
you
want
to
get
more
into
the
style
or
are
interested
in
an
atypical
drinking
experience
didnt
realize
this
was
a
koningshoeven
brew
drinkable
but
not
worth
the
unusually
high
price
which
hurts
this
aspect
of
the
score
dutch
brown
ale
is
medium
to
dark
leathery
brown
with
ruby
red
accents
when
held
up
to
the
light
about
an
inch
of
head
that
quickly
vanished
and
didnt
have
much
retention
or
lacing
a
malty
yeasty
and
nutty
aroma
but
nothing
really
stood
out
all
very
subdues
and
wellsettled
i
taste
roasted
malts
toffee
nuts
and
maybe
some
chocolate
not
much
bitterness
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
good
taste
makes
this
a
solid
session
brew
that
i
found
to
be
refreshing
and
a
decent
compliment
to
some
chocolate
chip
cookies
poured
into
a
snifter
for
a
seethru
leather
brown
body
with
quickly
dieing
onefiner
head
and
minor
lace
a
nice
orangey
yeast
strain
typical
of
belgians
is
in
the
aroma
behind
a
good
malt
array
of
roasted
toffee
coffee
caramel
and
some
chocolate
a
lighttomedium
body
that
went
down
smooth
creamy
and
easy
almost
watery
at
one
point
with
hints
of
orange
and
figs
but
the
key
is
the
malts
not
overtly
but
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
this
beers
balances
light
chocolate
toffee
coffee
bread
roasted
and
some
toasted
malts
for
a
sweet
beer
that
finishes
w
a
dry
backbite
this
is
a
great
sipper
to
relax
with
as
it
is
sweet
and
easy
drinkin
this
is
a
much
more
simple
taste
than
i
normally
associate
with
a
belgian
dark
ale
it
has
much
less
complexity
and
far
less
alcohol
that
i
thought
belonged
in
the
style
very
drinkable
but
i
feel
that
it
was
a
little
overpriced
for
a
session
i
didnt
really
like
this
beer
the
cloves
and
oxidisation
of
the
flavour
really
dominated
over
everything
else
and
detracted
from
the
experience
for
me
this
is
definitely
the
biggest
disappointment
from
koningshoeven
so
far
ontap
at
volo
malty
and
yesasty
aroma
mahogoney
dark
reddish
brown
with
some

not
complex

but
with
belgian
characteristic
finish
that
is
yeasty
not
overly
sweet
matt
said
i
would
appreciate
this
one
and
i
do
i
would
have
actually
pegged
it
blind
as
a
well
made
dubbel
as
there
is
obviously
no
etoh
for
a
session
dark
belgian
i
am
very
impressed
matt
should
get
rid
of
the
lesser
english
beers
and
move
this
one
to
the
cold
shelves
im
impressed
the
taste
is
also
quite
nice
easy
to
drink
yet
with
plenty
of
flavour
its
mostyl
fruitycaramelly
grapy
with
toasted
grain
stronger
in
the
finish
it
has
hitns
of
wineyfermented
plum
and
raisin
a
very
mild
dryish
peppery
quality
and
a
smooth
feel
i
was
able
to
give
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
on
tap
while
visiting
mahars
brew
pored
to
a
medium
brown
color
darker
in
the
bar
but
seemed
to
have
some
orangereddish
highlights
coming
through
medium
sized
head
that
lasted
for
a
minute
or
so
and
then
fades
to
a
film
some
lacing
the
nose
gives
a
nice
malt
character
with
caramel
brown
sugar
nuttiness
and
slight
apple
or
pear
the
flavor
imo
was
not
a
match
for
what
was
in
the
nose
as
it
seemed
to
be
muted
in
many
areas
very
sweet
imo
which
could
have
lead
to
the
muted
feel
while
the
sweetness
seems
to
be
slightly
overpowering
there
is
a
nice
roast
flavor
which
is
nice
just
wish
it
was
more
in
the
forefront
slight
hop
profile
found
which
comes
through
at
the
backend
though
it
does
not
stick
around
though
i
feel
like
i
did
bash
this
brew
a
bit
the
sweetness
while
a
little
too
much
was
not
overwhelming
and
the
flavors
that
i
picked
up
where
not
bad
just
muted
plus
it
drank
very
easily
fair
brew
just
would
not
pay
for
it
again
cheers
brown

2
finger
head
cant
smell
too
much
in
this
one
slight
malty
sweet
yeast
smell
taste
is
wonderful
this
is
the
smoothest
creamiest
drink
i
have
had
to
date
its
a
litte
sweet
but
not
too
much
at
all
nice
balance
with
the
hops
clean
finish
i
just
might
like
this
on
better
than
my
current
fav
brown
hazelnut
brown
nectar
from
rogue
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
the
bottom
of
the
glass
came
way
to
early
for
me
and
the
value
of
this
beer
makes
this
off
the
charts
for
me
i
can
pick
this
up
a
6er
of
this
beauty
for
6
50
note
i
assumed
this
was
a
brown
ale
but
just
noticed
it
is
a
belgian
dark
which
i
am
unfamiliar
with
but
i
think
my
review
is
still
good
pretty
smooth
nothing
outstanding
but
worth
trying
overall
i
cant
say
that
i
am
going
to
be
excited
to
reach
for
this
one
again
the
overall
flavor
profile
just
seems
rather
boring
i
cant
say
its
bad
but
there
is
very
little
about
this
one
that
would
bring
me
back
d
this
one
cant
be
called
balanced
but
its
certainly
unique
and
i
find
it
very
tasty
easy
enough
to
drink
and
quite
interesting
not
something
to
drink
all
night
but
i
wouldnt
mind
throwing
one
in
there
every
now
and
again
d
easily
drinkable
not
my
first
choice
but
wouldnt
be
my
last
choice
either
id
say
this
is
what
newcastles
big
brother
would
probably
taste
like
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
if
i
had
more
than
one
in
the
house
id
drink
the
other
mouthfeel
is
acceptable
overall
a
touch
light
but
sos
the
abv
and
complexity
the
finish
is
clean
leaving
a
mild
note
of
flowers
not
hard
to
drink
by
most
standards
but
nothing
exceptional
either
d
great
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
and
with
lots
of
flavour
not
sure
about
this
one
aroma
is
like
some
sort
of
candy
with
a
flavor
that
isnt
far
from
that
either
the
look
of
this
beer
is
great
nice
dusky
red
verging
on
brown
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
crags
up
after
a
second
or
two
the
flavor
is
average
at
best
i
dont
shy
away
from
funkiness
in
beer
but
this
one
is
too
all
over
the
place
to
have
a
good
flavor
profile
at
the
end
i
vaguely
taste
and
smell
grape
candy
on
this
one
a
huge
light
tan
head
forms
above
a
dark
brown
brew
the
head
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
small
clumps
of
lacing
behind
smells
of
deep
roasted
malts
followed
up
by
some
spice
and
a
very
subtle
sweetness
that
finishes
things
off
tastes
rich
and
malty
with
some
caramel
edges
that
surround
a
slight
bitterness
some
furtive
medicinal
notes
coat
the
finish
of
this
medium
bodied
yet
highly
drinkable
brew
d
good
brown
ale
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
a
little
less
sweet
than
new
castle
d
light
body
does
leave
it
rather
drinkable
but
the
flavor
isnt
good
enough
to
merit
a
higher
score
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
i
probably
wont
revisit
it
anytime
soon
a
nice
little
brown
ale
i
enjoyed
the
malt
sweetness
reminded
me
of
a
malted
soda
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
kind
of
a
bizarre
label
dont
know
whats
up
with
that
anyway
poured
with
a
nice
tan
foamy
frothy
head
and
little
lace

in
color
with

a

bittersweet

very
malty

with
a
little

smooth
decent

and

good
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
no

characteristics
a

sweet
in
the

could
be
a

beer
interesting
brown
ale
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
smells
of
malts
and
nuts
has
a
great
nutty
caramel
flavor
not
overpowering
minimal
and
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
as
it
goes
down
very
easy
a
slight
sweet
off
taste
at
the
end
but
only
on
the
first
2
drinks
smooths
out
and
evens
up
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
d
bottom
line
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
a
steal
at
7
99six
at
my
store
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
given
the
abv
you
could
have
a
few
of
these
without
getting
to
goofy
d
not
overly
viscous
but
still
a
little
thick
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
drinkin
em
all
night
seems
a
stretch
though
very
dark
brown
for
the
style
leaving
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
toasty
malt
smell
also
a
very
nice
smell
of
rotting
bananas
and
raisins
the
taste
is
like
the
newcastle
brown
ale
but
sweeter
and
with
the
rotting
fruit
character
that
i
noted
tasty
and
smooth
drinking
no
annoying
aftertaste
i
liked
it
probably
really
good
with
some
cheese
and
pretzels
pretty
good
though
it
seems
more
like
a
brown
ale
as
the
label
suggests
than
a
belgian
strong
dark
drinkability
this
beer
is
decent
i
prefer
more
malt
in
my
brown
ale
if
you
want
a
brown
ale
that
is
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
is
a
good
beer
for
you
very
reminiscent
of
newcastles
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
poured
from
a
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
rubyhued
deep
brown
almost
garnet
in
appearance
two
full
fingers
of
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
slowly
dissipate
to
a
sticky
oil
slick
and
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
smells
of
honey
and
dark
dried
fruit
raisins
caramel
malt
grain
taste
is
also
sweet
full
of
caramel
and
roasted
malty
goodness
more
dark
fruit
undertones
grain
and
bread
notes
follow
through
to
a
dry
finish
with
a
slight
hint
of
a
bitter
hop
bite
mouthfeel
is
watery
light
bodied
with
low
to
moderate
levels
of
carbonation
a
smooth
brew
that
goes
down
exceptionally
easy
being
paired
with
a
sweet
malty
aroma
and
flavor
along
with
the
low
abv
and
light
body
this
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
recommened
trying
if
available
definitely
a
worthwhile
beer
would
purchase
again
reddish
brown
beer
pours
a
lively
offwhite
head
nice
floral
aroma
taste
is
light
with
hints
of
raisin
and
caramel
but
is
pretty
subdued
the
watery
texture
helps
to
bring
a
clean
finish
not
a
very
big
beer
but
easily
drinkable
not
the
worst
but
ill
be
looking
elsewhere
for
my
next
brown
ale
md
medium
amount
of
carbonation
and
medium
body
just
perfect
for
the
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
d
a
great
brew
for
sure
but
the
sweetness
makes
me
think
twice
about
sessioning
this
brew
a
good
glass
but
that
might
be
all
i
need
at
one
time
this
is
a
gentle
pleasant
yet
big
and
complex
brown
ale
i
had
never
heard
of
it
until
i
saw
it
at
the
store
and
im
glad
i
did
d
very
drinkable
with
the
light
abv
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
we
have
readily
availiable
here
in
alabama
great
beer
d
at
5
abv
its
a
much
easier
drinker
than
the
stronger
dark
ales
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
in
a
sitting
without
feeling
overwhelmed
by
the
malty
flavor
i
like
this
one
and
if
anybody
didnt
know
the
cover
art
is
from
the
painting
garden
of
earthly
delights
by
hieronymous
bosch
it
is
an
excerpt
from
the
hell
panel
called
the
birdheaded
monster
of
the
three
paneled
painting
with
heaven
on
the
left
the
garden
of
eden
in
the
middle
and
hell
on
the
right
it
is
pretty
crazy
looking
and
was
painted
in
1519
on
that
note
on
to
the
beer
had
this
one
chille
in
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
goldish
color
smells
of
plesant
caramel
and
slightly
nutty
tastes
quite
the
same
reminds
me
a
bit
of
amaretto
i
could
enjoy
this
a
lot
smell
and
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
candied
fruits
tastes
like
another
brown
ale
in
the
line
of
newcastle
nothing
special
in
this
one
for
me
personally
drinkability
not
bad
every
once
and
a
while
but
it
is
not
going
to
be
one
of
my
regular
beers
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
is
very
good
very
smooth
and
drinkable
this
beer
really
is
a
nice
surprise
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
overall
this
is
a
good
i
would
definitely
recommended
picking
one
up
if
you
run
across
it
drinkability
call
me
crazy
but
this
seems
more
like
an
english
brown
to
me
and
i
thought
it
was
until
i
looked
above
at
the
supposed
style
and
somehow
this
is
the
same
brewery
that
makes
the
la
trappe
quad
which
i
love
i
had
no
idea
until
now
glad
i
got
to
try
the
single
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
again
as
are
other
more
bold
and
flavorful
styles
out
there
o
perhaps
not
my
favorite
but
still
a
worthy
choice
for
those
looking
for
a
good
brown
ale

dark
ale
mild
recommendation
oelergud
what
a
great
dutch
beer
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
by
far
on
this
planet
it
has
a
great
almost
fruity
wonderful
taste
sweet
and
very
solid
in
the
taste
department
nice
nice
smell
and
besides
the
lack
of
lacing
the
look
of
this
brew
is
great
i
love
the
dutch
and
this
beer
will
love
you
too
di
enjoyed
the
drink
but
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
many
of
them
a
nice
change
of
pace
definitely
not
a
session
brew
d
big
rich
dessert
treat
enjoyable
in
moderation
due
to
overwhelming
sweetness
this
bierbrouwerij
de
koningshoeven
brew
is
a
disappointment
especially
since
la
trappe
quadrupel
is
so
stupendous
given
the
wide
distribution
of
so
many
excellent
belgian
ales
theres
no
reason
to
buy
this
one
again

i
was

by
it

knowing
that

mouthfeel

not
heavy
not

not

usually

into
this

thin

decently
carbonated

oily
slightly
spiced
aftertaste
tasty
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this

quite

for
the

this

i
would
have
to

overall
though
pretty
good
nothing
fantabulous
but
good
enough
to
try
and
for
some
good
enough
to
go
back
to
maybe
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
because
it
was
labeled
as
a
brown
ale
when
it
turns
out
it
is
actually
a
dark
belgian

this
beer
is
also
very

belgianesque
esters
poke
around
in
the
back
taste
is
big
on
brown
sugar
and
dried
fruits
with
a
faint
fresh
fruitiness
in
there
somewhere
hops
are
mild
but
pleasantly
herbal
theres
a
slight
acidity
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
kind
of
too
sweet
for
me
mouthfeel
is
lightish
with
a
definite
sticky
characteristic
carbonation
is
mellow
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
too
much
i
think
id
like
this
a
whole
lot
more
if
it
was
better
attenuated
drinkability
average
amount
of
alcohol
but
the
massive
sweetness
of
this
lowers
my
desire
to
have
any
more
of
these
right
now
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
necessarily
pick
up
again
any
time
soon
drinkability
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
quite
easily
very
drinkable
as
it
isnt
to
alcoholic
or
bitter
and
goes
down
smooth
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
actually
it
isnt
bad
but
the
texture
is
weak
and
watery
and
doesnt
hold
it
up
im
not
a
belgian
expert
but
this
is
too
thin
and
doesnt
have
the
chops
or
complexity
of
my
favorite
belgian
darks
like
corsendonk
christmas
for
example
sweeet
and
plenty
malty
but
lacking
in
both
body
and
nuance
certainly
drinkable
but
nowhere
near
elite
in
the
style
aroma
was
a
barely
adequate
light
caramel
malt
with
chocolate
same
for
the
quaff

no
belgium
aspects
to
this
brew
at
all
just
ok
not
worth
the
8
a
sixer
price
tag
significantly
better
than
my
first
impression
d
pretty
drinkable
but
you
have
to
burp
a
lot
because
of
the
carbonation
the
taste
is
really
sweet
as
well
malt
with
some
fruit
hints
too
sweet
for
me
mouthfeel
seems
thin
as
well
leaves
a
lingering
aftertaste
dutch
brown
has
a
rich
taste
that
retains
a
certain
level
of
balance
despite
the
sweet
taste
this
is
a
beer
that
has
a
nice
reddishbrown
appearance
with
decent
head
retention
the
smell
matches
the
taste
for
the
most
part
giving
off
sweet
floral
and
toasted
characters
it
is
not
too
much
on
the
thick
side
for
this
type
of
beer
and
delivers
a
smooth
finish
that
make
it
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
great
selection
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
starts
thick
and
then
dissipates
without
notice
kind
of
a
mouthfeel
roller
coaster
a
weird
little
beer
but
one
that
is
enjoyable
enough
you
buyin
sure
ill
have
another
mouthful
is
on
the
creamy
side
nice
medium
body
finishes
mostly
clean
this
is
interesting
and
the
label
definitely
caught
my
eye
but
i
doubt
ill
get
this
one
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
amber
hues
the
head
is
small
and
recedes
witin
seconds
into
almost
nothing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
lively
than
the
aroma
it
is
of
caramel
with
some
nice
dark
spices
and
a
mil
yeastiness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
and
i
will
not
drink
it
again
man
the
label
art
is
a
bizarre
marvel
a
seated
bird
eats
a
naked
man
who
has
birds
flying
from
his
buttocks
this
beer
had
a
beautiful
color
and
good
head
retention
nose
is
malty
and
sweet
and
the
initial
taste
is
the
same
unfortunately
the
beers
characteristics
disappears
quickly
not
that
it
should
be
the
goal
of
a
beer
drinker
or
a
characteristic
of
a
good
beer
but
one
could
probably
get
really
drunk
off
of
this
tilburg
offering
its
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
for
its
own
good
and
definetly
more
sweet
than
most
brown
ales
poured
into

added
in

very
last
minutes
of

i
like
brown

and
this
one
is
more
than
drinkable
at
5
great
beer
overall
drinks
good
i
believe
my
tastebuds
other
senses
make
me
think
brown
ale
or
amber
ale
this
is
a
functional
if
not
inspired
session
choice
this
beer
is
decent
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
a
beginner
to
brown
ale
it
doesnt
have
that
much
to
offer
for
the
experience
drinker
though
drinkability
from
a
dutch
brewery
i
was
expecting
something
more
along
the
lines
of
a
british
brown
ale
than
a
belgian
dark
ale
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
not
bad
the
taste
is
pleasantly
malty
with
a
dry
nutty
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
that
is
worth
a
shot
and
is
something
i
would
not
mind
trying
again
a
medium
pour
produces
a
twofingered
pale
tan
head
of
medium
duration
and
good
lacing
brilliant
goldenamber
in
color
nose
is
plummy
yeasty
and
full
of
biscuity
malt
a
bit
rumraisiny
too
but
experience
tells
me
its
not
nearly
that
sweet
sweet
and
tangy
on
the
first
sip
with
biscuitmalt
filling
the
midpalate
before
succumbing
to
a
tangy
and
drying
effect
bitterness
is
mild
but
pronounced
and
works
well
at
offsetting
the
sweeter
aspects
of
the
pale
and
crystal
malts
the
yeast
character
which
is
imparted
really
reminds
me
of
the
konigshoevenlatrappe
line
especially
their
dubbel
which
i
havent
sampled
in
years
is
it
one
and
the
same
fruity
esters
about
with
banana
and
light
cherry
along
with
the
plumminess
apparent
on
the
nose
rather
like
an
alt
or
two
ive
tried
in
the
past
the
dryness
here
is
somewhat
complex
lingering
but
tempered
by
the
tanginess
of
the
yeast
also
it
really
seems
like
there
may
be
wheat
malt
oat
in
here
as
well
something
conbtributing
to
the
smooth
even
mouthfeel
and
banana
esters
light
honey
notes
impress
upon
the
palate
as
this
warms
a
bit
and
overall
the
mouthfeel
really
improves
with
warming
also
body
seems
thin
at
first
but
the
mouthfeel
helps
this
along
and
helps
to
make
it
quite
drinkable
altogether
a
very
good
beer
its
my
goto
imported
brown
ale
and
pairs
nicely
with
sharp
cheddar
served
chilled
in
chalice
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
this
however
there
is
no
doubt
its
the
weakest
offering
ive
had
from
bv

a
highly
quaffable

malty
nice
yeast

i
had
tried
this
a
few
months
ago
and
wasnt
impressed
but
that
was
before
i
understood
belgian
style
ales
and
appreciated
them
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into

snifter
the
beer
poured
a
deep
copper
forming
a
very
thick
1
inch
head
leaving
medium
lacing
on
the
glass
good
carbonation
with
endless
trails
rising
to
the
surface
the
aroma
is
on
the
light
side
but
there
are
still
hints
of
dark
fruit
aromas
along
with
a
little
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
very
interesting
but
not
as
complex
as
other
belgian
style
ales
that
ive
tried
light
fruityness
up
front
followed
by
a
little
malt
thickness
and
then
finishing
with
the
same
fruit
sweetness
a
little
light
on
the
flavor
for
a
belgian
but
nonetheless
still
tasty
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
smooth
finish
overall
i
have
to
say
i
was
wrong
with
my
first
impression
a
few
months
back
a
great
tasting
beer
and
one
i
will
continue
to
come
back
to
definitely
worth
a
try
taste
started
again
sweet
like
the
smell
hazelnut
notes
with
slight
coconut

there
was
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
that
rounded
with
flavors
of
burnt
toast
and
apple
butter
all
in

i
wasnt

been
putting
off

lacked

probably
wont

out
i
like
this
one
quite
a

it
doesnt
go

far
as
id
like
with

the
best
efforts
from

this
is

a

by
any

more
of

going

at
room
temps
to
get
the
most
from
the
unique
flavors
its
a
decent
and
unique
beer
but
probably
something
i
wouldnt
seek
out
again
id
drink
it
with
no
problem
if
someone
offered
one
after
letting
it
warm
up
quite
a
bit
first
o
a
truly
unique
beer
this
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
and
would
make
a
fabulous
dessert
beer
otasted
like
a
golden
ale
to
me
on
tap
it
was
pretty
good
i
have
a
bottle
yet
to
open
try
this
one
on
tap
if
can
o
my
experiences
with
lift
bridge
brews
have
been
hit
and
miss
i
love
the
saison
but
was
not
impressed
with
the
crosscut
ale
the
biscotti
falls
more
towards
the
crosscut
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
need
to
have
again
o
a
solid
made
beer
just
was
not
getting
the
tastes
out
of
the
beer
described
on
the
bottle
really
wished
there
was
more
vanilla
and
anise
flavor
a
good
effort
but
not
as
good
as
it
should
be
definately
worth
trying
and
my
first
since
they
moved
brewing
to
their
home
location
overall
pretty
good
but
could
certainly
use
some
tweaking
to
make
the
flavors
stand
out
more
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
i
thought
a
bit
syrupy
taste
is
a
little
sweet
too
be
sure
with
some
strange
funk
not
funk
in
the
belgian
sense
but
just
funky
and
not
really
good
tasting
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
suggest
or
buy
again
i
think
they
did
well
with
their
spices
in
the
commander
i
think
they
tried
and
hoped
to
repeat
the
awesomeness
that
was
the
commander
with
different
spices
really
just
didnt
work
however
glad
i
have
a
commander
downstairs
good
brewery
in
its
infancy
i
think
i
actually
dont
think
this
drinks
that
well
really
dry
and
the
flavor
is
kind
of
one
dimensional
and
boring
to
me
i
had
higher
hopes
especially
after
the
commander
but
this
just
is
not
worth
the
10bottle
price
tag
at
all
not
a
bad
beer
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
really
i
was
being
kind
and
finished
my
3oz
pour
at
the
party
anywhere
else
that
would
have
been
a
drain
pour
hopefully
that
was
a
fluke
i
had
it
on
tap
once
before
and
it
was
much
better
that
time
served
on
tap
poured
into
a
10oz
snifter
with
a
little
white
head
that
dissipated
instantly
had
a
spicy
and
malty
aroma
with
a
taste
that
pretty
much
fit
the
aroma
add
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
smooth
which
eluded
to
a
high
drinkability
factor
another
great
introductory
offering
from
lift
bridge
and
although
it
doesnt
taste
as
much
like
biscotti
as
i
had
hoped
its
still
good
enough
to
just
keep
on
drinking
just
because
this
beer
didnt
remind
me
immediately
of
biscotti
doesnt
mean
it
isnt
a
great
beer
because
it
is
i
really
liked
it
actually
not
much
going
on
here
at
all
a
good
beer
reminiscent
of
the
olden
darkale
days
1554
will
make
any
night
into
a
classic
not
too
strong
in
terms
of
abv
you
could
drink
1554
through
a
night
guiltfree
this
belgian
style
dark
ale
provides
a
classic
european
taste
with
fine
malt
and
a
toneddown
presence
of
hops
creamy
smooth
and
more
dulled
than
its
hoppy
neighbours
1554
is
the
social
drinkers
answer
to
one
well
planned
night
bringing
in
the
expert
craft
of
new
belgian
brewers
this
beer
offers
a
night
full
of
relaxation
and
comfort
with
its
earthier
tones
and
inviting
warmth
and
is
well
worth
the
adventure
dark
and
smooth
chocolate
and
coffee
on
the
nose
as
well
as
the
palate
always
have
this
one
stocked
nice
look
and
smell
very
thin
in
the
mouth
good
with
a
burger
this
is
my
everyday
go
to
that
wont
break
the
bank
smooth
going
down
and
lots
of
flavor
not
overpowering
ok
dark
ale
had
it
in
in
can
then
poured
ino
glass
durin
super
bowl
very
nice
dark
ale
with
some
chocolate
working
off
old
notes
will
update
with
more
details
ifwhen
i
have
another
overall
this
is
much
better
than
i
remember
from
years
ago
quite
complex
if
not
mindblowing
interesting
hybrid
style
hopefully
i
wont
go
as
long
before
drinking
my
next
one
i
think
this
is
an
underrated
beer
it
has
an
incredibly
dessertlike
flavor
delicious
o
a
very
smooth
easy
drinker
with
some
noticeable
flavor
characteristics
im
not
in
love
but
i
would
drink
it
again
roast
malt
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
esters
in
aroma
flavor
reveals
a
weak
belgian
yeast
character
of
pear
muted
roast
notes
and
a
base
of
dark
chocolate
very
drinkable
approachable
beer
with
varied
character
serving
type
bottle
overall
is
it
an
ale
is
it
a
lager
warm
fermented
with
lager
yeast
who
cares
its
a
really
tasty
really
drinkable
dark
beer
the
flavor
is
subtle
and
approachable
enough
to
not
scare
away
rookie
beer
drinkers
yet
ample
enough
to
satisfy
seasoned
craft
enthusiasts
no
small
feat
i
cant
find
a
whole
lot
wrong
with
this
beer
its
really
easy
to
knock
a
few
back
this
is
probably
my
favorite
new
belgium
beer
its
a
very
unusual
style
for
an
american
craft
brew
and
you
should
make
sure
to
try
it
goes
great
in
the
wintertime
but
is
available
yearround
dark
but
not
bitter
flavorful
but
not
high
alcohol
you
probably
havent
had
anything
like
it
in
these
parts
the
body
is
medium
and
its
boldly
but
not
heavily
crisp
while
remaining
extremely
creamy
with
a
semidry
feel
from
start
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
dark
reddish
brown
pour
nice
malty
smell
has
a
very
light
crispy
roasted
malt
taste
but
still
has
a
lot
of
flavor
can
also
taste
some
caramel
and
plum
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
1554
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
new
belgium
the
appearance
is
incredibly
dark
upon
pour
the
smell
is
the
worst
part
of
this
beer
with
a
weak
wheat
and
caramel
smell
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
are
incredible
though
with
a
very
smooth
finish
highly
recommend
especially
in
the
winter
o
every
time
i
come
back
to
this
i
find
it
to
be
good
but
not
great
i
do
buy
it
every
once
in
awhile
as
its
both
fairly
sessionable
and
enjoyable
thnak
you
for
viewing
xoxoxo
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
surprisingly
complex
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
isnt
extremely
heavy
and
has
good
flavors
which
make
it
surprisingly
sessionable
it
would
be
nice
if
they
made
a
one
off
imperialdouble
version
of
this
to
make
things
shine
a
little
brighter
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
balanced
between
foaminess
12
and
smoothness
12
that
works
for
the
beer
and
is
within
stylistic
guidelines
as
well
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
on
the
palate
final
thoughts
another
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
8
a
sixer
and
a
decent
5
6
abv
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
small
white
head
has
a
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
flavor
is
also
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
touch
of
malts
and
bitterness
taste
and
feel
are
both
a
tad
light
overall
this
is
pretty
decent
but
not
all
that
memorable
overall
a
good
dark
beer
i
would
have
liked
the
weight
to
reflect
the
color
and
the
flavor
was
quite
good
but
simple
simple
is
not
automatically
bad
but
this
review
comes
from
the
perspective
of
someone
whos
favorite
dark
american
beer
is
point
2012
black
ale
which
has
about
ten
thousand
flavors
going
on
o
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
what
i
love
is
how
refreshing
it
is
i
can
take
long
drinks
and
it
feels
great
would
definitely
recommend
this
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
but
a
tad
bit
on
the
sweet
side
overall
i
feel
like
its
unimpressive
i
go
to
my
local
grocery
store
when
i
want
something
dark
but
not
salty
like
guinness
all
they
have
is
1554
and
guinness
sure
it
hits
the
spot
when
you
need
a
satisfying
dinner
beer
but
this
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
1554
has
become
a
regular
staple
in
my
house
i
am
a
huge
fat
tire
fan
and
figured
i
would
try
some
of
new
belgiums
other
beers
they
are
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
and
is
always
in
my
house
they
have
a
great
variety
pack
at
costco
unfortunately
1554
is
not
apart
of
that
pack
good
stuff
overall
wonderfully
thick
and
smooth
ale
that
perfectly
balances
a
sweet
body
with
nutty
earthiness
i
can
only
describe
this
beer
as
delightfully
charming
but
satisfyingly
complex
i
will
soon
be
picking
up
more
1554
is
an
eyeopening
beer
the
combination
of
toasted
nutty
malts
and
sweet
chalky
yeast
characteristics
make
for
an
interesting
pairing
it
may
be
hard
to
convince
some
that
the
flavor
mesh
is
worth
tracking
down
a
bottle
still
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
that
i
would
certainly
have
again
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
good
beer
for
winter
not
a
typical
dark
belgian
style
expect
more
of
a
stout
or
porter
when
purchasing
i
would
have
it
again
but
would
not
be
my
top
choice
beer
from
new
belgium
mouth
rich
and
heavy
bodied
this
beer
is
fairly
heavily
carbonated
for
something
with
such
a
significant
malt
presence
pours
a
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
small
tan
head
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
when
sipped
perfect
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
slight
dry
smokey
finish
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
my
favorite
brew
from
this
company
by
far
great
brew
for
the
colder
months
mild
and
very
drinkable
very
smooth
overall
great
for
the
price
point
so
i
give
credit
to
nb
for
that
at
first
sip
you
notice
a
bitter
taste
by
the
second
tasting
you
notice
the
chocolate
not
usually
a
dark
beer
drinker
but
picked
this
up
in
a
variety
6
pack
glad
i
did
may
have
to
try
and
brew
this
one
myself
i
love
belgian
beers
with
abv
closer
to
6
as
was
this
one
must
try
this
one
if
you
havent
low
carbonation
but
very
tasty
great
after
dinner
drink
o
great
beer
i
would
like
to
take
this
recipe
and
make
a
dubbel
making
the
other
half
of
malts
all
wheat
great
beer
i
love
it
decent
beer
my
first
black
ale
and
i
was
pleased
if
im
feeling
up
for
a
malt
taste
without
feeling
like
im
drinking
molasses
this
would
be
my
go
to
the
feel
is
dry
smooth
and
very
easy
yet
full
enough
too
create
an
exceptional
experience
i
think
this
is
one
of
new
belgiums
finest
ales
and
one
of
my
favorites
o
very
sessionable
wish
it
was
more
carbonated
but
overall
a
great
malt
experience
poured
a
deep
maroon
almost
completely
brown
but
showed
some
beautiful
garnet
tones
in
the
light
cream
colored
head
that
lasted
a
very
long
time
nose
is
clean
but
abundant
with
deep
dark
fruits
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
and
raisins
the
flavor
is
much
similar
but
surprised
me
with
the
cocoa
which
added
a
nice
complexity
to
the
beer
rich
body
nicely
carbed
final
thoughts
going
in
to
this
review
i
was
expecting
to
find
1554
unable
to
hold
up
to
the
memory
i
have
of
it
but
as
it
turns
out
it
was
just
as
good
if
not
more
enjoyable
than
the
memory
a
great
beer
by
new
belgium
albeit
a
wrongly
categorized
one
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
bottom
line
worth
trying
overall
hard
to
believe
i
hadnt
reviewed
this
beer
yet
one
of
new
belgiums
older
and
more
popular
beers
its
decent
enough
but
its
never
been
a
beer
that
ive
ever
craved
while
enjoyable
on
its
own
this
is
far
from
the
strong
flavor
and
aromas
one
typically
expects
from
the
style
a
well
done
beer
similar
to
an
american
porter
or
black
ale
with
roasty
cocoa
and
malt
upfront
highlighted
by
the
hop
notes
though
in
this
case
it
is
a
more
floral
earthy
hop
character
this
beer
is
okay
but
how
is
this
really
different
than
an
american
porter
it
tastes
like
one
feels
like
one
and
appears
like
one
sometimes
i
feel
that
the
lines
of
beer
styles
is
heavily
blurred
overall
not
a
bad
brew
though
a
decent
easy
drinking
dark
beer
with
a
minimal
but
good
flavor
definitely
recommended
o
this
beer
is
defintely
worth
a
try
especially
since
it
is
so
easy
to
find
in
nbs
markets
however
for
ultimate
enjoyment
drinking
in
solitiude
is
prefered
to
enjoy
all
its
subtleites
a
very
nice
dark
ale
smooth
and
flavorful
delicious
dark
and
complex
amazingly
there
is
not
a
trace
of
bitterness
only
smooth
complexity
on
the
palate
from
beginning
to
end
for
such
a
dark
beer
the
lack
of
bitterness
was
as
surprising
as
it
was
awesome
it
is
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
but
over
here
on
the
east
coast
id
take
either
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
easy
beer
to
drink
the
presence
of
alcohol
flavor
makes
it
a
bit
hard
to
enjoy
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
nice
it
has
a
pleasant
roasted
flavor
that
fans
of
stouts
and
porters
will
undoubtedly
enjoy
overall
i
know
it
wont
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
but
if
you
drink
beer
and
enjoy
trying
al
of
them
you
must
add
this
to
your
portfolio
of
beers
you
have
had
i
had
zero
expectation
because
it
looks
like
guinness
and
i
hate
guinness
but
this
is
no
guinness
this
is
heavy
in
a
glass
made
out
of
cute
puppies
licking
you
and
acting
cute
every
sip
o
glad
i
tried
it
not
bad
at
all
just
not
special
it
honestly
reminds
me
of
the
yeungling
porter
which
i
assume
was
not
the
goal
of
this
beer
710
would
drink
again
on
my
scale
of
15
with
no
half
points
i
would
give
it
a
3
being
good
2
is
average
one
is
basically
a
drain
pour
4
is
excellent
and
5
is
the
holy
grail
of
beers
suffice
it
to
say
there
wont
be
too
many
ones
or
fives
cheers
prost
skol
years
ago
this
was
what
my
friends
and
i
would
purchase
for
parties
and
events
nearly
all
the
time
due
to
its
low
price
its
robust
flavor
and
its
highly
drinkable
character
its
still
a
beer
id
revisit
from
nb
whenever
possible
but
my
palates
definitely
changed
over
time
towards
it
still
at
the
low
abv
i
cant
complain
and
it
still
does
the
trick
even
now
for
people
who
wanted
to
see
better
maltfocused
beers
from
nb
give
this
a
whirl
tasty
brew
from
new
belgium
probably
my
favorite
from
them
so
far
interesting
blend
of
styles
dry
and
chocolatey
for
a
belgian
dark
the
verdict
tasty
a
good
solid
beer
this
may
be
my
favorite
new
belgium
offering
so
far
almost
more
of
a
sweet
porter
than
a
belgian
dark
ale
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
a
nice
dark
beer
without
the
strong
roastiness
found
in
most
stouts
o
a
nice
dark
ale
not
overexciting
but
well
made
and
tasty

poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
less
than
a
finger
length
of
very
light
tan
head
some
light
is
visible
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
it
is
ruby
copper
in
color
i
can
also
make
out
some
rising
tiny
bubbles
in
the
beer
the
beer
smells
of
bready
malt
toffee
and
dark
chocolate
theres
also
a
touch
of
earthiness
in
the
aroma
the
beer
is
nice
and
chocolately
with
some
mild
toffee
to
add
some
sweetness
i
also
get
some
of
that
malt
breadiness
and
some
earthiness
theres
some
roastiness
as
well
some
lingering
back
end
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
would
pair
nicely
with
a
good
meal
or
work
as
an
after
dinner
drink
just
got
back
from
a
road
trip
in
southern
illinois
cant
get
new
belgium
beers
in
alabama
where
i
live
tried
this
beer
in
a
local
restaurant
with
a
good
meal
and
found
it
to
be
the
perfect
paring
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
frosted
pint
glass
it
was
a
very
smooth
dark
beer
of
about
medium
body
with
a
slightly
sweet
taste
and
no
after
taste
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
o
there
is
a
lot
of
porter
character
in
this
beer
with
a
light
belgianlike
twist
which
made
a
lot
more
sense
when
i
read
that
the
yeast
is
handled
like
a
steam
beer
by
fermenting
a
lager
yeast
at
higher
temperatures
a
hard
to
place
beer
but
hard
to
forget
ive
been
looking
forward
to
another
bottle
of
this
for
almost
four
years
o
solid
belgian
dark
ale
not
outstanding
but
pretty
darn
good
i
struggle
to
find
beers
that
agree
with
me
but
1554
has
become
a
favorite
not
knocking
hoppy
beers
but
i
prefer
a
more
malty
creamy
brew
1554
delivers
a
creamy
malty
chocolate
mouthgasim
that
keeps
me
heading
back
for
more
its
very
smooth
and
i
get
no
objectionable
aftertaste
just
a
pleasant
reminder
of
its
flavors
i
may
be
a
noob
and
beer
sissy
but
1554
just
plain
works
for
me
i
usually
drink
it
right
out
of
the
bottle
but
i
have
obtained
some
pint
glasses
of
late
and
it
seems
to
bring
out
more
flavor
overall
one
of
my
favorites
from
new
belgium
such
a
brilliant
black
ale
the
description
on
the
bottle
says
it
all
this
beer
pours
up
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
and
leaves
extensive
and
elaborate
lacing
retention
is
good
the
color
appears
to
be
black
but
holding
it
up
to
the
light
shows
a
deep
ruby
color
the
nose
is
kind
of
salty
and
soy
sauce
with
notes
of
coffee
taste
is
licorice
and
coffee
with
some
sweet
chocolate
mouthfee
is
mild
and
inoffensive
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
special
overall
a
rather
tasty
brew
a
little
on
the
sweeter
porter
like
side
but
still
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
rjt
o
surprisingly
good
i
like
new
belgium
brewery
but
for
the
most
part
their
beers
usually
rank
as
just
slightly
above
average
to
me
this
one
sits
a
little
higher
than
that
i
could
definitely
see
myself
picking
this
up
again
in
the
future
or
trying
it
on
draft
if
i
can
find
it
o
one
of
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
something
different
from
the
norm
a
really
nice
change
of
pace
good
flavor
not
overly
complex
brew
could
have
fooled
me
into
thinking
it
was
a
porter
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
sucks
its
not
in
jersey
in
the
military
had
some
great
beers
and
this
is
one
of
them
it
is
outstanding
great
flavor
nice
and
thick
i
had
it
a
few
weeks
ago
in
tx
one
thing
good
about
wichita
falls
looking
forward
to
when
it
makes
its
way
to
nj
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
fingerthick
cream
head
and
medium
lacing
smells
of
dark
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
tastes
fullbodied
and
complex
nice
toasted
barly
highlighted
with
some
chocolate
and
a
pinch
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
also
some
spices
detected
nice
light
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
start
and
a
bubbly
finish
overall
a
good
brew
very
new
belgiumy
yes
thats
now
a
word
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
deep
ruby
red
hue
thin
lacing
sweet
pleasant
coffee
aroma
with
some
spicy
overtones
dark
chocolate
flavor
very
nice
and
smooth
malt
forward
light
to
medium
mouth
feel
medium
carbonation
overall
not
a
very
complex
ale
but
simplicity
can
be
a
nice
break
sometimes
very
enjoyable
overall
a
great
dark
beer
flavorful
and
complex
im
going
to
blame
the
greenness
on
the
bottle
and
not
the
beer
has
an
added
dimension
to
the
typical
brown
ale
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
friendly
alternative
for
those
turned
off
by
the
characteristics
of
a
porter
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
poured
this
belgian
dark
ale
from
a
12
oz
glass
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
color
produced
a
thick
tan
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
medium
bodied
this
ale
contained
a
foundation
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
pear
and
belgian
yeast
nice
session
beer
good
example
of
the
style
o
fantastic
beer
and
very
drinkable
and
it
had
the
hallmarks
of
the
beers
i
really
crave
sweet
dark
malts
a
dry
aftertaste
and
repressed
hops
but
it
seemed
to
lack
a
floral
depth
and
juiciness
that
i
get
with
my
usual
belgian
blacks
from
unibroue
and
yet
the
1554
is
usually
considered
the
gold
standard
for
belgian
blacks
eh
terrific
but
it
doesnt
quite
make
the
pantheon
3
75
recommended
to
drink
warm
this
beer
really
shines
overall
not
bad
but
tastes
like
a
decent
porter
not
the
belgium
character
i
expectedwanted
but
cuts
it
as
a
easy
drinking
porter
o
the
story
of
the
recipe
on
the
bottle
is
more
interesting
than
the
beer
unfortunately
it
is
good
but
ive
had
many
a
porter
and
dry
stout
which
is
what
this
belgian
dark
suggests
that
are
better
for
a
similar
price
point
kind
of
surprisingly
low
review
for
me
because
i
tend
to
like
new
belgiums
offerings
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
another
good
brew
from
new
belgium
i
actually
never
heard
of
this
one
its
not
one
of
their
big
names
in
mainstream
craft
brews
but
i
really
liked
it
and
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
o
nice
drinkable
beer
nutty
malts
balanced
by
a
nice
roast
coffee
good
beer
to
grab
when
its
a
little
chilly
outside
or
when
you
want
a
sessionable
flavorful
beer
poured
into
a
glass
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
pours
a
very
thick
head
that
last
for
quite
some
time
nice
dark
color
that
looks
like
a
cross
between
an
amber
and
a
porter
taste
is
a
bit
of
chocolate
malts
with
a
subtle
hop
finish
pretty
smooth
overall
and
medium
bodied
it
didnt
have
a
coffee
taste
like
some
of
the
other
black
ales
ive
had
but
id
say
overall
this
was
a
solid
black
ale
by
new
belgium
i
really
dont
want
to
seem
cliche
giving
this
beer
a
perfect
score
but
quite
honestly
i
had
absolutely
zero
gripes
with
it
im
a
big
fan
of
new
belgiums
beers
and
im
a
dark
ale
guy
and
this
stuff
is
honestly
the
most
appealing
beer
ive
ever
tasted
when
you
smell
it
the
sweet
caramel
chocolate
aroma
hits
hard
giving
you
a
good
sign
of
what
youre
in
for
the
head
on
this
stuff
is
gorgeous
although
not
the
worlds
thickest
its
a
true
beauty
to
look
at
once
youve
poured
it
into
a
glass
im
really
glad
to
see
so
many
positive
reviews
on
this
beer
because
in
all
honesty
its
my
new
favorite
ill
definately
be
buying
it
again
and
probably
many
more
times
to
come
a
belgian
style
black
beer
im
not
sure
what
category
this
fits
in
exactly
it
pours
a
deep
amber
not
quite
black
but
fairly
opaque
theres
a
big
malty
nose
on
it
almost
cloyingly
sweet
thats
your
cue
to
be
prepared
1554
has
a
rich
thick
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
with
some
tartness
to
balance
it
out
its
not
a
bitter
beer
nor
is
it
roasty
so
save
it
for
dessert
while
this
is
a
great
beer
and
easily
drinkable
its
missing
the
one
standout
thing
that
could
give
it
a
perfect
score
ogood
beer
would
go
well
with
dessert
will
get
again
pours
a
pretty
deep
garnet
clear
with
a
big
frothy
fluffy
tan
head
that
persists
throughout
the
whole
beer
smells
are
roasted
and
sweet
much
like
a
porter
tastes
are
roasted
slight
floral
and
slight
cooked
vegetable
to
me
and
a
little
nutty
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
a
little
pungent
and
the
body
a
bit
flat
its
possible
i
drank
this
a
little
too
warm
but
i
dont
think
so
this
beer
does
take
on
a
strange
aroma
once
at
the
end
or
room
temp
like
an
average
dinner
cooking
strange
my
score
reflects
the
initial
aroma
only
o
i
like
this
for
a
go
to
beer
when
you
want
an
enhanced
flavored
sessional
beer
nice
malt
blend
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
bitter
dryness
to
round
out
the
sweetness
i
will
purchase
this
again
for
sure
cheers
want
to
write
a
review
for
the
record
try
but
not
really
qualified
to
post
here
much
less
than
an
average
good
for
this
beer
not
really
liking
the
style
much
this
is
a
toasted
roasty
malt
forward
something
of
a
beer
and
is
ok
not
really
too
bitter
with
complex
notes
of
bread
caramel
and
some
cocoa
moderate
to
low
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
is
ok
this
a
very
satisfying
rich
and
smooth
dark
ale
it
reminds
me
somewhat
of
milk
duds
candy
in
liquid
form
a
soul
satisfying
beer
tastedark
toasted
malt
some
spicy
belgian
yeast
notes
subtle
chocolate
nicely
balanced
and
pretty
tasty
the
subtle
spiciness
really
makes
this
brew
nice
flavor
and
character
pair
with
a
big
burger
or
a
plate
of
tacos
recommended
this
beer
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
tap
the
color
was
absolutely
gorgeous
with
exception
clarity
the
2finger
ivory
head
held
up
well
with
very
nice
lacing
while
this
beer
looks
like
a
stout
in
the
glass
the
feel
in
the
mouth
is
very
much
an
ale
a
nice
crisp
feel
with
notes
of
malty
sweetness
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
and
molasses
with
nearly
no
bitterness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
must
try
tasty
little
brew
here
bsdas
are
usually
more
my
speed
but
this
is
a
very
solid
nonstrong
interpretation
and
i
could
definitely
throw
back
a
few
of
these
one
after
another
o
this
is
an
impressive
beer
that
i
find
to
have
a
very
high
drinkability
factor
i
would
very
much
enjoy
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
were
found
in
my
area
but
it
is
not
to
be
currently
it
is
clean
flavorful
smooth
and
everything
else
that
a
great
beer
should
contain
well
done
and
i
will
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
yes
pours
dark
brown

a
solid
eggshell
colored
head
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
through
consumption

sweet

is
great

chocolate
and
a
belgian
candy
sugar
finish
refreshing
yet
full
of
body
and
depth
sweet
yet
dry
on
the
finish
too
bad
i
have
just
one
anyway
most
noticed
its
lager
traits
in
their
mouthfeel
reviews
it
is
a
very
light
beer
and
incredibly
sessionable
i
poured
this
nice
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
dark
beer
with
a
really
nice
creamy
head
i
like
that
the
smell
was
faint
roastedness
smell
the
beer
was
actually
a
little
bland
i
thought
for
what
it
looked
like
i
still
liked
it
as
it
was
very
drinkable
and
i
will
buy
again
pretty
good
black
ale
great
balance
of
roasted
malt
and
bitterness
o
not
black
or
enlightening
just
a
decent
easy
drinking
beer
not
likely
to
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown

a
thick
creamy

that
retains
well
and
laces
the
glass

roasted
chocolate
taste
is
favorably
mild
with
a
great
dryish
mixture
of
black
malts
and
chocolate
with
just
a
hint
of
dried
floral
spices
and
yeast
just
barely
sweet
within
and
has
a
bit
of
roastyness
the
beer
is
dark
brown
approaching
black
with
a
quarter
inch
of
beige
head
the
aroma
brings
some
belgian
style
malts
chocolate
a
touch
of
grain
the
flavor
brings
some
sweet
milk
chocolates
and
some
bready
malts
not
the
most
refined
flavor
but
easy
enough
to
throw
back
a
pint
of
this
light
to
medium
in
body
and
fairly
creamy
on
the
palate
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
beer
in
college
so
it
was
nostalgic
to
return
to
it
after
a
long
hiatus
overall
pretty
solid
black
ale
or
belgian
dark
ale
i
was
really
surprised
how
tasty
this
beer
was
when
i
drank
it
pretty
solid
score
and
happy
that
my
brother
chose
to
bring
this
back
from
his
trip
to
tn
next
time
i
am
out
in
colorado
i
will
have
to
hunt
this
beer
down
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
off

there
is
a
slight
scent
of
roasted
malts
mixed
with
a
mild
yeast
tone
the
taste
has
a
mild
roasted
malt
taste
the
texture
and
volume
is
perfectly
done
smooth
tasty
and
refreshing
a
rather
boldly
made
brew
that
most
will
find
very
likeable
a
great
brew
for
those
looking
to
start
drinking
dark
beers
but
cant
quite
handle
a
porter
or
stout
yet
a
great
beer
for
the
price
o
a
good
beer
flavors
arent
terribly
complex
but
they
are
executed
well
the
rich
flavor
without
an
overpowering
aftertaste
makes
for
a
nice
drinking
experience
i
would
certainly
have
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so

there
is
a
nice
sublet

but
with
a
profound
oakey
flavor
hints

everything
blends
well
overall
a

easy

good
flavors
complex
a

going
on
and
it
comes
together
nicely
i
really
like
this
beer
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
porter
some
have
said
that
they
experience
a
burnt
taste
with
new
belgium
beers
i
do
get
a
smokey
smell
and
taste
in
this
beer
but
not
a
burnt
sensation
i
can
drink
several
of
these
while
relaxing
on
a
fall
evening
i
find
it
lighter
than
a
porter
but
still
similar
the
smell
is
lighter
than
a
porter
and
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
also
lighter
if
you
read
my
reviews
i
like
dark
beers
and
this
is
a
dark
beer
that
i
enjoying
drinking
regularly
i
keep
these
in
my
refrigerator
at
all
times
even
a
new
craft
beer
drinker
will
enjoy
experiencing
one
of
these
as
a
leadin
to
porters
and
then
stouts
onothing
really
stands
out
in
this
beer
no
glaring
flaws
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
as
an
actual
beverage
to
drink
its
awful
unbalanced
sickingly
sweet
no
hop
character
horribly
toffee
flavored
it
may
be
an
old
recipe
but
not
all
old
things
are
good
overall
a
pretty
good
and
interesting
ale
not
really
a
black
ale
like
we
think
of
them
now

maybe

improved

and
lingered
well
after

paired
quite
nicely
with
my

and
was
good
with

well
overall
so
so
close
to
being
such
a
great
beer
in
my
line
of
work
we
have
something
called

this
is
a
case
of
a
near
miss
some
things
done
phenomenally

others
just
lacking
o
a
good

but
not
a
great
one

flavors
are
all
there
but
theyre
watered
down
despite
that
its
well
balanced
and
delivers
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
in
one
package
m
smooth
mediumfull
body
with
nice
carbonation
o
while
its
good
i
think
its
too
hard
to
drink
given
its
mild
flavor
profile
its
still
worth
a
try
and
i
might
even
get
it
again
in
the
future
overall
it
was
ok
and
a
nice
effort
for
recreating
an
old
beer
with
a
partial
belgian
recipe
but
i
would
not
seek
this
out
and
deem
this
my
least
favorite
new
belgium
beer
thus
far
this
beer
was
just
off
to
me
somehow
and
while
it
was
not
bad
it
really
just
didnt
excite
me
all
that
much
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
16dec12
pours
a
black
color
with
dark
brown
hues
and
a
thin
tan
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
nutty
chocolate
with
some
malts
and
earth
some
hazelnut
coffee
as
well
taste
is
more
of
the
chocolate
nuttiness
but
with
a
bit
more
coffee
flavor
than
the
aroma
malty
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
crisp
autumn
nights
overall
worth
grabbing
again
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
mixed
style
of
ale
the
chocolate
and
lightly
roasted
malts
blend
very
well
with
the
subtle
belgian
yeast
notes
pours
black
with
a
beige
head
a
kinda
sweet
and
roasty
aroma
but
not
super
distinct
flavor
didnt
work
for
me
roasted
a
slight
touch
of
chocolate
and
a
healthy
dose
of
candied
sugar
and
bubblegum
yuck
ill
give
it
a
3
because
i
think
my
reaction
is
more
subjective
than
objective
but
i
definitely
did
not
like
this
and
did
not
finish
my
glass
a
nice
medium
creamy
body
overall
not
for
me
a
definite
pass
that
i
wont
try
again
o
a
subtle
nod
to
belgian
yeast
throughout
the
beer
is
a
brilliant
touch
to
differentiate
this
dark
ale
from
either
a
stout
or
porter
something
that
carefully
pushes
boundaries
the
real
shining
point
though
is
the
balance
of
malt
suggesting
some
of
the
darker
qualities
without
being
aggressive
or
overpowering
leaving

quite

this

that
leans
towards
a

medium

there
is
no
belgian
character
that
i
can
detect
worth
revisiting
as
a
brown
ale
its
not
heavy
like
a
porter
or
stout
but
its
still
slightly
thick
with
a
creamy
head
and
everything
enlightened
i
guess
its
definitely
a
maltier
beer
and
a
great
choice
on
a
cool

this
is
one
of
the
most
schizoid
brews
i
have
ever
had
the
displeasure
of
tasting
its
all
over
the
place
theres
some
story
on
the
bottle
about
the
intrepid
researchers
of
the
brewery
finding
a
recipe
in
belgium
from
the
year
1554
for
this
beer
and
how
this
beer
is
different
than
modern
beers
well
if
that
is
true
perhaps
history
was
trying
to
teach
us
something
and
theres
a
reason
this
poorly
evolved
ancestor
of
modern
beers
is
extinct
if
you
are
a
maltster
not
a
hophead
you
will
love
this
beer
period
overall
good
for
a
light
black
ale
as
far
as
belgian
darkstrong
ales
go
this
shits
weal
sorry
its
tasty
and
all
but
it
will
never
be
up
there
with
the
big
boys
new
belgium
knows
beer
1554
is
no
exception
i
received
this
beer
at
a
restaurant
it
was
presented
in
a
tall
thin
glass
it
was
very
dark
and
only
semitransparent
it
had
a
34
head
which
it
sustained
for
about
ten
minutes
the
smell
was
earthy
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
it
had
a
heavy
feel
but
really
smooth
like
silk
the
taste
was
earthy
and
fruity
with
a
hint
of
something
sweet
perhaps
chocolate
as
with
most
of
new
belgium
beers
i
give
1554
twothumbsup
finishes
chewy
and
sweet
i
actually
like
this
but
im
not
sure
about
hte
category
i
dont
get
a
ton
of
the
belgian
yeast
but
i
do
get
the
malt
which
is
why
i
would
put
it
as
a
porter
or
aba
overall
an
ok
beer
but
kind
of
lacking
in
all
areas
a
little
underdone
i
felt
overall
this
was
an
excellent
albeit
unexpected
find
for
just
throwing
this
in
because
i
kind
of
liked
the
packaging
a
little
and
needed
a
sixth
beer
i
hadnt
tried
to
round
out
the
pack
i
am
impressed
kudos
to
new
belgium
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
porters
and
stouts
i
will
buy
and
drink
again
for
sure
o
the
best
brew
ive
had
to
date
from
new
belgium
the
finish
in
this
beer
is
amazing
overall
an
enjoyable
dark
fruity
tasting
beer
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
drinks
like
a
thick
creamy
milkshake
and
tastes
like
the
dark
fruits
and
biscuit
which
you
expect
from
a
fat
tire
i
found
a
new
friend
o
not
too
bad
not
spectacular
it
didnt
have
the
depth
i
was
hoping
for
its
at
least
worth
a
try
and
the
historical
aspect
is
cool
not
impressed
not
recommended
not
bad
but
a
little
too
watery
for
me
ontap
at
the
brewery
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
smooth
notes
of
smoke
charred
sugar
and
coffee
are
quickly
washed
away
by
a
mild
sweetness
and
lingering
spicy
hop
note
bitterness
is
mild
not
much
in
the
way
of
any
belgian
yeast
notes
save
for
a
subtle
cherry
and
plum
fruitiness
and
a
hint
of
clove
the
goal
seems
to
be
a
drinkable
approachable
and
easygoing
dark
beer
and
i
would
say
new
belgium
hit
that
mark
o
not
a
style
that
is
ever
going
to
blow
you
away
with
complexity
but
this
beer
is
satisfying
without
being
too
heavy
and
i
could
enjoy
it
year
round
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
good
overall
just
a
little
too
watery
for
me
the
taste
is
decent
but
this
isnt
something
that
stood
as
a
beer
i
need
to
revisit
overall
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
o
not
sure
why
but
this
brew
taste
like
fat
tire
mixed
with
chocolate
undertones
to
me
thats
good
but
im
not
sure
if
thats
what
they
were
going
for
overall
its
very
solid
good
beer
from
new
belgium
o
an
easy
drinker
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
dry
a
little
too
high
on
the
carbonation
than
i
would
have
expected
bitter
earthy
coffee
finish
but
it
has
a
depth
of
flavor
and
aromas
that
make
it
an
alright
beer
to
try
although
i
doubt
id
ever
really
seek
it
out
again
very
tasty
like
a
belgian
schwartzbier
not
my
favorite
style
i
prefer
my
belgian
darks
to
be
strong
but
this
is
nothing
short
of
quality
it
doesnt
surprise
me
with
new
belgium
i
dont
care
for
the
blatant
american
twist
on
a
belgian
style
in
the
way
that
many
craft
brewers
do
tripels
or
pales
this
is
legit
maybe
a
relief
as
most
belgian
darks
from
the
home
country
are
swimming
in
yeast
esters
this
ale
is
complex
enough
to
make
you
stop
and
muster
up
what
you
can
in
between
sips
yet
drinkable
enough
to
forget
that
youre
writing
a
beer
review
i
support
you
drinking

only

an
enjoyable
dark

smooth
and
even
somewhat
sessionable
due
to
the
lower
weight
for
the
style
a
dank
new
belgium
treat
for
me
here
in
pa
looking
forward
to
east
coast
distribution
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
so
take
it
for
what
its
worth
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
wasnt
filling
and
it
had
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
row
without
a
problem
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
pretty
much
everything
i
thought
everything
was
on
par
for
the
style
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
slightly
higher
amount
of
sweetness
in
the
flavor
if
it
was
toned
down
a
little
the
flavor
would
be
pretty
damn
good
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
but
since
i
cant
buy
it
in
michigan
i
doubt
i
will
be
having
it
again
anytime
soon
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
i
think
it
would
make
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
this
was
a
pretty
solid
belgian
dark
ale
from
a
pretty
solid
brewery
good
job
guys
keep
making
good
beers
and
ill
keep
seeking
them
out
a
solid
belgian
dark
ale
but
brewery
vivants
solitude
is
still
my
favorite
belgian
dark
ale
the
beer
looks
good
deep
and
very
dark
brown
with
a
big
effervescent
tan
head
that
has
strong
retention
but
not
much
lace
the
aroma
is
a
little
weaker
than
the
taste
but
still
exhibits
nicely
chocolatey
malt
character
the
mouthfeel
is
likewise
well
done
with
a
medium
body
thats
moderately
and
smoothly
carbonated
not
exactly
belgian
in
feel
aside
from
the
drying
finish
but
that
doesnt
hurt
the
beer
much
if
at
all
in
my
opinion
nice
unusual
session
candidate
from
new
belgium
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
coffee
taste
is
different
for
this
style
coffee
a
touch
of
chocolate
without
being
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
brew
o
decent
not
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
but
an
easy
drinker
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
off
white
head
that
retains
well
and
laces
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nutty
lactic
roasted
chocolate
taste
is
favorably
mild
with
a
great
dryish
mixture
of
black
malts
and
chocolate
with
just
a
hint
of
dried
floral
spices
and
yeast
just
barely
sweet
within
and
has
a
bit
of
roastyness
i
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
conical
shaped
glass
and
was
greeted
with
a
two
finger
of
tan
color
head
that
faded
to
some
very
nice
lacing
the
color
was
a
nice
black
that
showed
ruby
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
nose
was
dominated
by
light
and
sweet
malt
with
coffee
and
caramel
notes
the
taste
was
sweet
with
the
malt
that
faded
to
an
almost
powdered
cocoa
note
the
mouth
feel
was
medium
and
clung
to
the
palate
but
lacked
major
carbonation
on
the
tongue
overall
impression
is
a
nice
drinkable
ale
it
may
well
do
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
or
after
dinner
drink
overall
very
drinkable
and
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
the
complexity
in
the
taste
is
subtle
but
its
there
deep
mahoganyred
color
with
low
co2
and
a
light
brown
rocky
head
lacing
is
sticky
and
head
retention
is
low
aroma
is
acerbic
and
malty
with
a
metallic
background
tastes
lightly
sweet
at
the
start
with
dark
fruits
caramel
with
a
metallic
dry
finish
palate
is
medium
bodied
creamy
and
lightly
effervescent
pours
a
dark
brown
that
glints
red
in
the
light
a
foamy
creamtan
head
that
attenuates
to
lacing
around
the
glass
a
dark
roasted
malt
aroma
with
notes
of
belgian
yeast
the
first
pull
into
the
mouth
promises
mild
creaminess
pleasant
smooth
creaminess
over
the
entire
tongue
with
a
mild
bite
of
coffee
acidity
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
fireplace
or
bbq
smoke
throughout
nothing
special
but
quite
drinkable
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
something
id
seek
out
though
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
very
smooth
and
rich
dark
ale
with
a
thickness
of
a
belgian
and
still
a
cleanness
of
a
lager
very
nice
as
a
historian
i
love
uncovering
the
past
as
they
do
in
this
beer
please
uncover
more
o
a
tasty
beer
and
a
great
value
my
first
belgian
dark
ale
pours
dark
very
light
khaki
head
same
sweet
spiced
flavor
profile
as
a
dubbel
but
lighter
and
more
subdued
making
it
almost
more
drinkable
this
way
but
kinds
one
note
the
only
one
ive
had
so
far
would
love
to
try
the
real
thing
to
see
how
this
one
compares
d
its
not
bad
but
theres
nothing
belgian
about
this
one
which
is
a
disappointment
there
are
far
better
offerings
from
the
brewery
o
very
easy
drinker
with
good
flavor
o
a
nice
nonthreatening
beer
that
makes
for
a
nice
gateway
into
dark
or
belgian
beer
1554
is
delicious
i
personally
think
it
would
benefit
from
a
little
thicker
complexion
but
that
probably
would
make
it
less
drinkable
its
a
good
stepping
stool
for
people
who
want
to
get
into
darker
beers
o
1554
is
a
great
option
for
anyone
who
enjoys
his
beer
rich
and
malty
o
a
decent
beer
worth
buying
from
time
to
time
because
of
the
price
point
but
also
nothing
special
o
tastes
are
well
balanced
and
not
overpowering
everything
blends
nicely
for
fantastic
drinkability
out
of
all
that
ive
tried
from
new
belgium
this
comes
the
closest
to
being
a
true
belgian
overall
as
solid
easy
drinker
reviewed
on
01312011

by
sheer
volume
i
must
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
beer
my
on
hand
selection
is
rarely
without
it
a
decent
beer
overall
nothing
too
special
but
it
gets
the
job
done
id
give
it
another
go
some
time
overall
it
is
still
a
very
good
beer
it
just
has
some
faults
appears
a
very
dark
brown
in
the
glass
shortlived
stumpy
head
with
minimal
lacing
smells
and
tastes
mostly
of
roasted
malts
porterstyle
with
a
backing
support
of
chocolate
i
cant
really
find
any
black
coffee
aroma
or
flavor
in
this
particular
brew
but
the
flavor
does
stay
somewhat
surprisingly
dry
for
something
categorized
as
a
belgian
dark
and
it
does
have
a
medium
strength
serving
of
standardissue
pine
resin
hop
bittering
in
the
finish
at
least
texture
is
medium
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
drinkability
a
pretty
good
american
take
on
a
belgian
ale
very
average
drinkable
o
this
is
a
great
everyday
or
session
beer
it
has
enough
flavor
to
make
it
enjoyable
but
not
overpowering
overall
i
love
the
taste
of
it
because
of
the
roasted
tones
and
chocolate
i
do
buy
this
often
and
will
buy
it
again
the
only
weird
thing
thats
not
too
pleasant
is
the
alcohol
metallic
taste
but
nonetheless
the
more
enjoyable
pleasant
taste
overpower
that
the
aftertaste
of
cocoa
makes
one
realize
this
is
a
delicous
beer
give
it
a
try
overall
for
a
dark
belgian
ale
its
tolerable
and
actually
drinkable
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
but
still
ok
overall
a
very
quaffable
beer
from
new
belgium
and
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
them
medium
bodied
beer
with
nice
balance
and
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
but
i
wish
there
were
more
distinctive
qualities
o
good
session
beer
of
the
darker
variety
i
would
go
back
to
this
one
the
pour
is
of
a
very
dark
belgian
ale
not
much
of
a
head
beer
may
have
been
too
cold
sweet
plummy
caramel
scent
on
the
nose
fruity
sweet
cherry
like
tartness
also
detected
tastes
of
a
slightly
bittering
chocolate
with
some
pretty
nice
plum
fruitiness
on
the
back
very
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
crowd
pleaser
a
bit
thin
however
but
a
darn
good
beer
i
am
pleased
to
have
finally
tried

pours
crystal
clear
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
dense
khaki
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
decent
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
big
caramel
toasted
malt
chocolate
light
coffee
spicy
hops
and
light
biscuit
some
nice
and
well
balanced
aromas
with
good
strength
taste
of
caramel
biscuit
toasted
malt
light
chocolate
spicy
hops
and
malty
sweetness
no
bitterness
with
lingering
notes
of
light
chocolate
caramel
and
toasted
malts
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
finish
is
a
lot
drier
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
and
the
flavors
arent
very
robust
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
lightly
creamy
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
no
alcohol
noticed
other
than
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
this
is
extremely
drinkable
overall
a
nice
beer
but
pretty
lack
luster
in
my
opinion
when
i
read
it
was
a
black
ale
i
was
expecting
a
much
more
robust
flavor
and
body
a
bit
thin
for
what
i
was
expecting
but
this
simple
brew
is
pleasantly
approciable
and
went
down
quickly
making
me
wishing
for
another
enjoyed
once
and
would
enjoy
it
again
pleasantly
surprising
selection
i
just
grabed
it
for
a
pick
your
own
six
pack
with
out
paying
much
attention
i
havent
been
a
new
belgium
fan
in
the
past
so
i
didnt
expect
much
i
was
pleased
as
i
poured
to
see
it
was
dark
like
weak
coffee
which
could
describe
the
smell
also
mouth
feel
was
nice
not
to
thin
and
perfect
carbonation
tasted
of
malt
and
slight
coffee
very
drinkable
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
and
will
absolutely
buy
more
o
first
off
i
will
say
i
am
not
a
fan
of
coffee
that
being
said
im
sure
others
will
enjoy
this
more
than
me
coffee
pretty
much
dominated
this
brew
but
if
you
like
coffee
you
should
try
this
m
medium
body
smooth
carbonation
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
an
awesome
dark
belgian
ale
so
smooooth
and
tasty
it
went
down
way
too
easy
clean
and
well
made
but
pretty
plain
a
nice
alternative
to
the
dull
porters
i
would
have
called
it
a
schwarzbier
for
the
light
body
and
subdued
flavors
i
dont
get
any
flavors
that
id
call
belgian
but
maybe
its
a
very
selfeffacing
yeast
another
winner
at
a
very
affordable
price
from
new
belgium
overall
i
think
its
a
pretty
decent
dark
belgian
it
reminds
me
of
a
black
lager
almost
but
with
a
far
more
interesting
finish
this
is
one
id
been
interested
in
for
a
long
time
but
hadnt
tried
because
of
the
inability
to
just
buy
singles
here
i
can
see
why
it
sticks
around
in
new
belgiums
lineup
but
its
a
quiet
one
drinkability
this
is
a
very
agreeable
appealing
sipping
beer
and
as
a
result
of
its
fullness
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
two
at
a
sitting
it
is
easy
to
drink
gives
excellent
value
for
the
cost
and
id
definitely
buy
it
again
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
the
first
tier
of
black
ales
but
its
definitely
high
in
the
second
tier
i
picked
this
bottle
up
on
my
recent
thanksgiving
travels
you
cant
find
nb
here
in
kentucky
very
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
2finger
head
of
frothy
white
foam
very
little
light
getting
through
but
appears
to
be
quite
clear
and
free
of
haze
the
nose
is
very
faint
but
primarily
offers
toast
and
a
touch
of
pine
the
flavor
is
mild
malty
complex
and
quite
sweet
its
very
reminiscent
of
a
scottish
ale
there
are
some
flavors
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
pancakes
and
the
hops
are
only
strong
enough
to
balance
things
out
just
a
tad
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
perhaps
just
a
bit
thin
with
all
that
malt
present
overall
this
is
a
nicetasting
easy
drinking
beer
its
a
little
mild
for
my
tastes
but
its
not
bad
at
all
overall
its
a
slightly
different
dark
ale
in
terms
of
flavor
but
it
tastes
great
and
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
its
good
to
see
new
belgium
has
put
alot
of
time
and
effort
into
creating
what
is
truly
an
outstanding
beer
i
remember
thinking
that
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
beer
for
some
reason
that
was
many
years
ago
though
dont
think
ive
had
it
since
this
is
a
lot
better
than
i
remembered
it
being
i
wonder
what
makes
this
a
belgian
dark
because
i
dont
detect
any
belgium
yeast
might
just
be
overpowered
by
the
roasted
malts
which
may
be
too
prevalent
now
that
i
think
about
it
poured
in
a
weiznen
glass
clear
dark
mahogany
with
a
light
brown
head
and
decent
lacing
lightly
roasted
malt
aroma
chocolate
and
roasty
a
bit
musty
light
medium
body
and
oily
texture
taste
lightly
bitter
with
a
very
long
dry
and
lightly
burned
finish
overall
refreshing
but
bold
enough
to
keep
interesting
id
drink
this
with
a
glass
of
water
on
the
other
hand
i
just
finished
a
long
hike
but
on
the
whole
quite
nice
lighter
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
character
tiz
tha
season
this
beer
is
great
for
the
winter
not
to
dark
in
color
when
poured
out
light
heat
that
hangs
an
min
or
so
any
way
the
smell
is
great
when
you
smell
this
beer
you
think
it
will
be
light
in
hops
and
high
in
malts
it
is
a
very
good
brew
it
has
a
sweet
nutty
finish
with
a
nicely
balanced
hops
behind
it
pick
6
at
kroger
people
this
is
the
best
way
to
find
these
great
craft
beers
cheers
m
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
refreshing
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
makes
for
a
great
session
while
not
an
overwhelming
beer
this
does
bear
the
criteria
for
a
pleasant
sessional
though
i
could
not
establish
anything
resembling
an
ipa
as
this
neat
little
beer
is
void
of
any
hoppiness
dark
mild
and
malty
would
be
the
three
stooges
stumbling
around
in
the
glass
with
this
one
still
i
do
like
it
as
a
mild
quaff
for
any
time
of
the
year
overall
ehhh
it
was
a
good
beer
that
is
not
to
be
scoffed
at
but
with
that
said
it
is
also
one
of
the
least
impressive
cdasblack
ipas
that
ive
tried
it
is
very
vanilla
sex
compared
to
a
lot
of
the
other
offerings
of
this
genre
hmm
good
beer
but
an
a
average
seems
to
high
i
am
a
fan
of
the
amber
ale
fat
tire
1554
beer
has
a
touch
of
belgium
to
it
the
beer
has
a
subtle
taste
subtle
aroma
and
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
however
my
favorite
belgium
brews
have
a
little
more
flavor
and
some
yeast
stuff
like
stuff
floating
around
with
a
bouquet
of
fruit
wood
and
spice
smacking
your
senses
1554
has
a
little
of
all
of
this
but
it
lacks
a
little
bit
everything
atmosphere
is
really
solid
nice
head
and
lacing
nose
is
a
really
fine
toasted
malt
with
bitter
and
sweet
components
flavor
is
a
great
balance
of
grains
with
a
little
pungency
and
a
subtle
sweetness
very
dark
brown
color
and
develops
only
a
small
head
when
poured
in
the
center
of
a
snifter
the
overall
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
i
detect
a
hint
of
cherry
the
brew
is
quite
carbonated
and
taste
better
to
me
if
i
swirl
the
brew
in
the
glass
to
release
some
of
the
carbonation
while
not
my
favorite
it
is
a
good
effort
this
beer
is
just
about
how
i
remember
it
tasty
though
a
little
rougher
around
the
edges
than
id
expect
from
one
of
my
intro
craft
beers
very
woody
a
little
bit
roasty
and
rather
hollow
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
bland
malty
cherry
tatse
more
carbonation
than
id
like
with
little
personality
this
was
the
second
time
ive
had
this
first
time
on
tap
now
in
bottle
i
didnt
really
like
it
then
and
i
dont
really
like
it
now
not
worth
drinking
which
is
unlike
my
usual
view
of
nb
a
beer
without
real
identity
low
in
hop
bite
slightly
sweet
and
with
a
fairly
substantial
roasted
flavor
but
nothing
to
distinguish
it
from
the
pack
the
roasted
almost
smokey
flavor
is
the
most
pronounced
attribute
it
lacks
something
just
cant
specify
what
easy
to
drink
light
and
refreshing
for
a
complex
beer
pretty
good
all
around
but
nothing
crazy
about
it
just
a
nice
beer
d
its
actually
quite
easy
drinking
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
jive
for
me
on
the
level
that
others
have
before
it
o
overall
pretty
well
balance
very
nice
feel
on
the
pallet
drinkable
solid
brew
overall
im
probably
going
to
get
this
again
its
a
little
more
pricey
than
some
of
the
other
similar
brews
ive
had
but
a
very
solid
brew
o
this
ale
is
nothing
special
and
really
contributes
nothing
new
to
this
style
its
really
quite
bland
not
worth
going
out
of
ones
way
to
try
poured
into
a
new
belgium
globe
glass
beer
is
a
deep
rich
earth
soil
black
the
creamy
tan
head
dissipates
leaving
a
nice
layer
of
head
as
the
beer
goes
down
sticky
random
lacing
the
smell
is
at
first
a
bit
boozy
but
otherwise
hints
of
bitter
chocolates
and
raisins
are
present
the
beer
tastes
of
raisins
dark
chocolate
banana
peels
over
a
roasted
malt
presence
an
average
mouthfeel
maybe
a
tad
carbonated
overall
this
would
make
a
good
dessert
beer
but
it
feels
much
heavier
than
5
6
abv
its
got
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
to
mill
over
as
you
slowly
enjoy
this
having
said
that
ive
found
that
i
struggled
to
get
through
my
six
pack
over
several
days
there
is
something
about
this
beer
that
i
just
do
not
like
o
for
the
style
its
mediocre
not
bad
to
drink
but
to
me
it
doesnt
stand
out
o
after
the
smell
i
was
thinking
this
was
going
to
have
the
complexity
and
flavor
of
something
like
chimay
blue
but
really
feel
short
glad
i
tried
but
dont
think
i
will
get
it
again
i
have
really
enjoyed
the
lips
of
faith
series
but
the
regular
new
belgium
beers
have
been
very
underwhelming
in
my
opion
my
favorite
new
belgium
offering
so
far
pours
black
w
only
a
little
brown
highlight
head
is
beige
and
laced
the
tulip
well
nice
smell
of
roasty
biscuit
and
what
i
think
is
that
signature
new
belgium
yeast
roasty
taste
is
not
overpowering
and
the
sweetness
is
a
perfect
balance
to
the
bitterness
of
the
roast
its
not
at
all
sickening
sweet
and
ends
semisweet
light
carbonation
starts
sharp
and
ends
creamy
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
light
scotch
ale
in
a
way
id
highly
recommend
this
and
will
be
seeking
it
out
again
one
of
the
best
new
belgium
beers
ive
had
poured
into
a
frosted
pint
glass
with
a
vigorous
cream
colored
head
smell
is
roasty
and
boozy
a
bit
unique
to
some
degree
flavor
is
great
wow
really
different
that
anticipated
hard
to
describe
in
a
way
very
unconventional
black
ale
missing
the
heavy
filling
dimension
really
super
sessionable
mouthfeel
is
soundly
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
really
nice
with
spicy
food
as
well
overall
a
decent
belgian
dark
ale
tastes
way
better
than
it
smells
o
great
taste
subtle
smell
and
it
looks
awesome
despite
the
hohum
mouthfeel
it
is
something
i
would
enjoy
again
poured
from
a
bottle
good
looking
dark
ale
with
a
thin
head
and
decent
lacing
the
beer
had
a
decidedly
roasted
quality
with
hints
of
toffee
drinkable
and
fairly
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
was
okay
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
from
new
belgium
that
i
wasnt
really
expecting
o
new
belgium
has
always
been
one
of
the
better
mainstream
breweries
1554
is
defiantly
not
a
great
beer
but
its
certainly
good
the
biggest
drawback
is
that
the
beers
texture
is
on
the
light
watery
side
the
chocolate
and
sweet
malt
come
out
pretty
good
i
was
really
surprised
by
the
alcohol
presence
considering
that
its
only
5
6
if
your
choices
are
limited
i
would
defiantly
suggest
this
beer
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
epic
if
they
offered
it
in
six
packs
in
my
area
i
would
probably
buy
again
at
some
point
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
little
head
that
quickly
leaves
slight
lacing
smells
of
coffe
taste
doesnt
really
become
apparent
until
after
you
swallow
it
then
the
carbonation
kicks
in
the
taste
of
coffee
lingers
after
overall
a
decent
beer
i
would
pick
this
up
again
o
a
nice
brew
smooth
with
nice
flavors
but
is
a
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
and
would
have
like
more
head
retention
overall
enjoyable
with
a
hard
pour
gives
a
thick
tan
3
finger
head
and
a
deep
ruby
black
brown
body

overall
sweet
and
dry
slight
bitterness
from
roasted

at
the
back
of
the
tongue
really
comes
through
more
in
the
finish
solid
medium
body
very
creamy
smooth
and
dry
finish
highly
drinkable
enjoyed
this
very
much
in
the
past
enjoyed
this
very
much
again
for
my
review
not
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
belgian
characteristics
other
than
the
hint
of
esters
i
got
on
the
nose
but
i
will
not
hold
that
against
this
brew
o
a
tasty
dark
ale
with
a
touch
of
funk
and
fruit
smooth
on
the
palate
with
just
a
touch
of
funk
overall
impression
while
people
are
thused
about
this
brew
i
just
think
its
good
and
drinkable
i
never
really
go
for
this
if
i
see
it
in
a
6pack
but
had
to
give
it
a
try
ontap
enjoyed
it
and
will
be
again
im
sure
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
some
different
than
a
stout
or
porter
then
i
have
a
good
brew
i
can
turn
to
cheers
this
is
a
great
malty
standby
appropriate
for
the
colder
months
ive
always
been
partial
to
this
brew
because
of
its
mouthfeel
maybe
ive
been
too
generous
in
my
recommendations
but
everyone
ive
offered
this
to
has
liked
it
very
solid
and
easy
to
come
by
overall
it
is
fairly
tasty
with
some
easily
enjoyable
qualities
but
it
feels
and
tastes
like
an
american
brown
ale
rather
than
a
belgian
style
beer
this
doesnt
feel
taste
or
smell
belgian
style
at
all
o
this
brew
once
was
my
favorite
brew
but
that
was
in
college
apparently
my
taste
has
changed
a
nice
brew
but
not
worth
seeking
serving
type
bottle
onice
balanced
beer
with
alot
of
flavor
overall
pretty
good
nice
and
drinkable
almost
like
a
creamy
porter
with
nice
flavors
doesnt
get
too
bitter
or
acrid
burnt
flavors
nice
smooth
and
drinkable
demeanor
poured
a
dark
brown
w
twofinger
head
that
dies
quick
but
left
lace
patches
on
top
of
a
roasted
and
sweet
aroma
yet
i
detect
a
decent
presence
of
yeast
and
im
getting
some
orange
hints
from
citriclike
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
i
get
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
simple
yet
goes
down
easy
and
gives
off
some
minor
citric
fruitiness
and
a
balance
of
dry
roasted
and
sweet
malt
and
has
a
hearty
dry
finish
another
not
perfect
but
pretty
damn
good
and
inexpensive
belgian
ale
from
new
belgium
a
definite
repeat
for
me
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
solid
overall
beer
overall
pretty
good
tastes
similar
to
a
stout
without
the
heavy
feel
i
know
i
am
not
known
as
a
belgium
fan
usually
like
the
simpler
elegance
of
a
german
but
having
tried
and
enjoyed
hoptober
and
fat
tire
recently
i
thought
it
would
be
great
to
try
something
dark
this
one
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
downed
the
entire
22
oz
myself
and
that
says
a
lot
deep
rich
brownmahogany
in
the
glass
with
a
creamy
rich
tan
head
that
fell
but
maintained
a
presence
nicely
lacing
the
glass
all
the
way
down
flavor
was
a
touch
sweet
buttery
malt
a
touch
roasted
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
bitternessall
in
perfect
balance
rendered
the
whole
incredibly
smooth
creamy
and
without
any
odd
flavors
that
may
have
impacted
drinkability
very
good
and
im
hoping
that
we
get
the
smaller
bottles
out
here
very
soon
one
id
keep
around
for
daily
consumption
wow
o
i
find
most
of
new
belgiums
yearround
offerings
pretty
underwhelming
but
i
enjoyed
this
o
one
of
new
belgiums
better
beers
actually
really
solid
stuff
this
is
a
delicious
smooth
beer
that
id
gladly
buy
again
especially
if
i
wanted
something
that
tasted
like
a
stout
with
less
of
a
roasted
taste
a
nice
dark
session
beer
high
drinkability
and
belgian
complexity
that
makes
for
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
decent
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
new
belgium
this
beer
is
a
nice
session
beer
it
is
cheap
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
too
me
its
like
a
poor
mans
black
butte
a
rather
drinkable
dark
beer
but
a
little
thin
with
this
type
of
roasted
malt
character
i
prefer
a
thicker
beer
overall
nice
flavors
except
for
that
finish
just
not
a
lot
going
on
to
distinguish
itself
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
still
cant
get
over
its
similarity
to
stellanot
that
theres
anything
intrinsically
wrong
with
stella
i
just
would
expect
something
a
little
more
complex
from
new
belgium
o
a
pleasant
surprise
since
im
not
a
fan
of
fat
tire
good
recommendation
for
an
early
winter
brew
o
not
a
sipping
beer
the
best
thing
about
it
was
that
magically
went
down
faster
than
drinking
water
as
if
it
was
coated
with
silicone
i
think
the
aim
was
to
drink
this
with
food
it
would
go
well
with
some
meaty
food
because
its
a
good
complimentary
beer
but
not
a
stand
out
by
itself
o
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
this
is
not
a
belgian
dark
ale
this
tastes
like
something
between
a
really
dark
brown
ale
and
very
tasty
stout
its
very
good
i
didnt
expect
this
at
all
its
so
smooth
and
crisp
definitely
something
i
was
excited
to
get
at
this
local
dive
bar
while
on
a
road
trip
this
is
must
try
in
my
opinion
d
decent
brew
seemed
more
malty
then
anything
else
i
wouldnt
seek
this
brew
out
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
however
its
very
subtle
flavor
fails
to
come
through
powerfully
but
smoky
vanilla
and
nutty
flavor
lingers
in
mouth
lack
of
hoppy
bitterness
keeps
it
nice
and
wet
in
the
mouth
surprisingly
light
and
bubbly
for
a
darker
beer
good
with
a
hearty
steak
and
potato
dinner
also
pour
a
big
head
because
this
foam
is
delicious
i
gotta
say
this
ones
a
pleasant
surprise
ill
be
looking
to
have
this
one
a
bit
more
once
the
weather
cools
o
ive
had
this
one
before
a
long
time
ago
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
good
maybe
they
changed
the
recipe
this
might
be
one
of
my
go
to
beers
from
now
on
really
enjoyed
this
pours
a
dark
cola
like
color
which
shows
no
light
except
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
lightm
the
was
a
skim
off
white
head
which
left
a
little
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
the
taste
follows
the
nose
big
toasted
malt
backbone
with
chocolate
and
coffee
coming
in
in
the
middle
the
mouthfeel
was
well
it
wacarbonated
overall
i
thought
it
was
closer
to
a
porter
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
favorite
for
the
style
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
great
taste
and
beautiful
style
one
of
my
goto
beers
i
prefer
a
slightly
sweeter
spicier
blend
with
more
hops
this
left
me
with
the
impression
of
onedimensionality
although
it
did
have
a
palatable
flavor
which
would
blend
well
with
most
foods
overall
drinkability
had
this
beer
before
a
while
back
and
remember
not
liking
it
at
all
its
much
better
this
time
since
ive
never
had
another
belgian
dark
ale
im
just
going
to
rate
it
as
a
beer
in
general
with
belgian
strong
dark
ales
like
chimay
blue
as
a
partial
reference
point
new
belgium
1554
my
introduction
to
belgian
beers
was
a
leffe
brune
in
brussels
and
the
introduction
was
habit
forming
amazing
what
those
belgian
monks
can
do
stateside
to
recreate
the
belgian
experience
the
new
belgium
abbey
ale
comes
close
the
new
belgium
1554
is
a
different
animal
it
has
the
prerequisite
off
white
head
fabulous
aroma
and
deep
black
color
i
actually
like
the
1554
a
bit
better
in
the
flavor
department
its
not
quite
so
honey
sweet
has
good
complexity
and
even
a
touch
of
bitter
you
may
not
like
it
better
than
your
favorite
belgian
dark
ale
but
it
is
unique
enough
to
mix
it
into
the
rotation
for
some
variety
o
a
very
good
beer
on
tap
in
a
lot
of
places
in
denver
i
enjoy
this
brew
a
lot
when
im
visiting
the
mile
high
overall
i
enjoyed
it
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
but
was
a
good
beer
cheers
fun
and
spunky
warm
and
comforting
this
beer
is
excellent
for
many
occasions
drink
it
with
friends
enjoy
it
at
home
hoppy
trails
overall
this
is
a
winner
and
worthy
of
a
try
the
12er
had
this
one
trippel
2
below
a
winter
ale
and
fat
tire
14
bucks
for
the
12
best
way
to
describe
the
flavor
is
roast
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
its
got
robust
flavor
without
being
too
heavy
perfect
beer
for
winding
down
in
the
evening
i
enjoy
having
a
small
piece
of
dark
chocolate
with
it
a
very
good
dark
ale
not
to
heavy
and
not
too
light
pours
dark
with
a
little
head
that
dissipated
quickly
with
a
little
lacing
nice
well
balanced
beer
with
light
chocolate
and
toffee
flavor
a
little
more
mild
than
i
expected
but
overall
quite
drinkable
and
a
pretty
goodlighter
dark
beer
with
5
6
abv
a
good
beer
to
have
a
couple
of
without
being
overpoweringly
alcoholic
o
an
okay
beer
not
really
that
exciting
but
is
a
good
6
pack
if
you
like
darker
beers
o
a
nice
brew
pretty
tasty
yet
lower
abv
which
is
nice
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
one
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
really
quite
nice
well
rounded
and
a
flavor
that
would
appeal
to
newbies
that
are
ready
to
venture
on
to
the
darker
dark
beers
it
has
a
mass
appeal
about
it
hard
to
pin
down
anything
wrong
with
it
but
also
difficult
to
nail
down
what
is
right
with
it
i
use
to
really
like
this
beer
more
than
i
do
now
no
thanks
to
ba
and
my
developing
palate
these
days
i
find
it
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
not
refined
or
complex
enough
for
my
liking
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
someone
offered
me
one
but
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
if
i
could
find
it
1554
is
not
bad
but
not
great
its
a
good
all
around
sturdy
brew
for
beginning
dark
beer
drinkers
if
this
beer
where
around
in
1554
i
think
it
would
of
blown
the
burlap
sacks
off
people
today
though
not
so
much
as
too
flutter
an
occasional
dress
its
still
my
favorite
new
belgium
brew
that
ive
have
tasted
thus
far
cheers
o
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
like
i
expecting
o
tremendous
effort
here
and
one
to
drink
any
time
of
year
great
tasting
not
filling
and
a
joy
to
drink
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
drinks
almost
as
a
lighter
slightly
sweeter
porter
pours
with
a
lacy
white
head
clear
rich
mahogany
color
aroma
is
mainly
roasted
malt
and
molasses
not
overpowering
taste
is
rich
roasted
and
caramelly
with
a
lingering
sweetness
and
alcoholic
warmth
although
only
5
6
abv
creamy
mouthfeel
slight
bitterness
on
finish
medium
carbonation
a
wellbalanced
ale
somewhat
like
a
lighterbodied
baltic
porter
overall
an
excellent
beer
with
a
complexity
of
flavors
you
dont
always
get
in
a
lower
gravity
brew
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
goto
beers
from
new
belgium
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
caramel
and
chocolate
in
the
taste
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
a
small
grapefruity
hop
presence
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
hop
and
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
like
a
thin
porter
or
a
lighter
version
of
a
black
ipa
overalldefinitely
a
beer
id
get
again
nice
flavors
easy
to
drink
and
wont
break
the
bank
overy
good
beer
with
great
balance
and
drink
ability
you
can
knock
back
a
couple
of
these
and
feel
great
very
solid
o
im
not
sure
what
style
to
really
classify
this
beer
as
while
the
recipe
might
be
from
1554
the
brewing
practices
of
the
day
would
probably
have
produced
a
beer
with
a
little
more
interesting
yeast
character
take
this
for
what
you
will
in
this
context
i
think
it
is
somewhat
of
a
dissappointment
for
authenticitys
sake
however
it
is
a
tasty
sessionable
beer
akin
to
a
slightly
estery
schwarzbier
i
do
know
that
this
is
a
big
gateway
beer
for
some
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
but
to
my
taste
not
a
drainpour
by
far
but
not
enough
to
order
another
or
go
out
of
the
way
not
that
it
isnt
ubiquitous
already
nice
taste
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
but
nothing
overwhelming
i
love
this
style
from
a
local
belgium
style
pub
and
this
doesnt
quite
compare
but
a
nice
beer
if
looking
for
dark
beer
without
the
robust
characteristics
of
porterstout
i
feel
like
some
black
ales
are
misleading
something
so
dark
would
appear
to
be
full
of
flavor
but
color
is
not
always
indicative
of
quality
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
texture
but
it
could
use
something
else
a
higher
abv
some
chocolate
i
dont
know
something
o
good
beer
but
unlike
other
black
ales
ive
tried
worthwhile
and
quite
drinkable
but
probably
not
something
id
go
for
again
nice
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
really
solid
beer
not
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
but
a
very
nice
version
i
will
definitely
get
again
this
beer
pours
a
light
to
medium
in
body
a
dark
dark
chestnut
brown
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
one
finger
beige
colored
creamy
head
it
smells
of
lightly
roasted
dark
malts
with
a
light
slightly
bitter
chocolate
aroma
i
dont
get
where
people
are
saying
that
they
get
any
yeast
from
this
i
think
this
smells
more
like
a
porter
the
flavors
are
of
slight
dark
chocolate
with
a
light
roastiness
and
a
creamy
finish
it
has
the
mouthfeel
of
french
press
coffee
and
cream
its
very
flavorful
but
again
i
say
this
tastes
more
like
a
porter
i
poured
this
aggressively
so
it
initially
had
a
pretty
large
head
i
think
this
sucked
some
of
the
carbonation
out
of
it
but
it
made
the
beer
very
creamy
and
soft
and
exceptionally
smooth
overall
i
like
this
beer
is
it
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
its
debatable
i
think
this
drinks
more
like
a
porter
than
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
thats
fine
with
me
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
though
i
dont
think
i
will
revisit
it
until
late
fall
or
winter
drinkability
its
a
fairly
hearty
beer
with
a
very
fallwinter
style
i
like
this
and
would
drink
it
again
but
probably
during
the
cooler
months
a
very
good
belgian
style
black
ale
do
more
akin
to
a
brown
ale
then
a
belgian
in
my
opinion
i
enjoyed
this
one
easy
drinking
but
flavorful
id
take
multiples
of
this
in
one
sitting
if
i
wasnt
so
hellbent
to
get
my
taste
buds
on
something
new
im
a
beer
whore
o
d
an
ok
beer
dont
think
its
a
great
belgian
nice
warming
on
the
finish
good
beer
very
well
done
o
a
good
beer
worth
having
around
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
eliminating
some
of
the
watered
down
flavor
would
make
this
an
exceptional
beer
new
belgium
makes
a
lot
of
good
beers
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
they
make
anything
bold
or
strong
bottle
poured
dark
brown
with
tall
still
head
nutty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
apple
spices
and
cloves
sweet
bready
taste
slight
bitterness
keeps
it
light
tasting
medium
dry
finish
light
body
and
texture
medlow
carbonation
an
enjoyable
and
different
brown
ale
m
creamy
and
light
at
the
same
time
transferred
a
sixer
of
the
1554
to
some
diet
pepsi
plastic
bottles
to
smuggle
into
a
ball
game
the
dark
cola
color
of
the
1554
perfectly
matched
the
displaced
soda
though
the
bubbles
were
slightly
off
white
upon
pouring
into
a
plastic
cup
i
was
greeted
with
a
small
bone
colored
head
that
did
not
linger
too
long
aromas
were
of
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
dried
fruit
perhaps
some
brown
sugar
very
smooth
beer
with
an
easy
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
body
overall
minimal
bitterness
with
predominantly
roasted
malt
flavor
i
would
say
good
but
not
a
great
beer
great
for
stadium
smuggling
in
cola
bottles
though
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
good
drinking
dark
ale
d
easy
to
drink
beer
could
have
a
couple
of
these
easily
good
flavors
wish
some
were
more
prominent
though
still
good
beer
overall
this
one
drinks
nice
and
easy
d
quality
and
easy
drink
unique
roasted
and
burnt
flavors
give
it
a
try
you
wont
be
terribly
disappointed
something
i
find
interesting
about
1554
is
that
i
find
it
hard
to
compare
to
anything
else
its
quite
odd
for
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
its
definitely
not
an
american
stout
or
porter
its
just
good
simply
put
od
a
really
good
drinker
and
overall
it
really
works
12
oz
into
a
snifter
great
appearance
really
a
knock
out
big
head
that
retains
well
on
top
of
a
deep
black
body
i
dig
it
smell
doesnt
impress
me
that
much
decent
malt
but
not
that
complex
good
notes
of
dark
malt
decent
balance
no
significant
yeast
character
which
is
one
thing
i
always
expect
if
a
beer
is
going
to
have
the
balls
to
call
itself
a
belgian
style
beer
tastes
similar
on
the
tongue
to
the
nose
doesnt
really
break
any
new
ground
clean
though
with
a
good
malt
profile
mouthfeel
is
fine
nothing
objectionable
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
can
imagine
it
being
so
much
better
that
its
not
that
impressive
i
guess
its
ok
as
far
as
value
overall
pretty
good
but
nothing
great
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
some
nice
chocolate
too
a
beer
i
would
have
again
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
an
extremely
malty
beer
that
smells
like
a
stout
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
ash
roasted
malt
coffee
and
cream
a
great
mix
of
flavors
that
all
meld
very
well
together
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
belgianstyle
stout
one
of
the
better
yearround
new
belgium
beers
this
one
is
a
solid
beer
pretty
simple
but
it
adds
a
dimension
not
found
in
a
lot
of
americanmade
dark
malt
beers
the
one
thing
that
i
didnt
like
here
was
the
overall
mouthfeel
wasnt
much
although
it
was
a
nice
smooth
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
something
going
on
when
you
take
the
intial
drink
o
great
beer
unique
taste
i
would
but
again
poured
out
of
a
12ounce
bottle
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
dark
brownlight
black
color
that
is
transluscent
2
fingers
of
head
or
so
with
nice
lacing
and
a
aroma
ofdark
dried
fruit
with
the
hint
of
the
bready
belgian
yeast
taste
is
what
is
expected
a
dark
candy
flavor
malty
with
no
real
hop
bitterness
overall
a
good
beer
for
first
time
drinkers
of
a
dark
belgian
ale
overall
solid
o
a
good
beer
but
nothing
more
while
many
interesting
flavors
were
present
in
this
beer
they
were
very
subdued
nothing
stood
out
to
separate
this
beer
from
the
pack
although
i
wouldnt
turn
this
beer
down
by
any
means
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
o
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
much
its
pleasant
enough
and
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
wont
be
stocking
it
in
my
fridge
either
d
just
ok
im
not
thrilled
with
this
offering
or
really
this
style
not
a
great
session
beer
in
my
opinion
but
worth
trying
it
goes
well
with
most
foods
and
its
one
of
those
beers
that
you
just
dont
get
tired
of
i
wish
it
were
easier
to
find
and
maybe
a
few
local
bars
could
start
stocking
this
one
a
good
beer
its
not
one
id
necessarily
seek
out
but
wouldnt
mind
having
again
if
you
see
this
beer
give
it
a
try
its
good
beer
a
pleasant
flavorful
malty
and
earthy
brown
ale
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
its
interesting
enough
and
is
certainly
an
accessible
craft
brew
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
bit
tame
in
characteristics
everything
seems
to
be
balanced
well
but
its
just
too
laid
back
very
quaffable
and
sessionable
its
not
horrible
and
would
be
fine
for
a
change
of
pace
i
could
have
several
of
these
at
one
time
with
relative
ease
my
first
beer
from
new
belgium
in
fort
collins
co
and
my
first
beer
enjoyed
right
here
in
colorado
i
have
never
had
a
beer
so
smooth
and
so
creamy
the
whole
beer
is
so
delicate
and
light
on
the
mouth
big
tan
head
that
lingers
and
lingers
and
lingers
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
fig
roasted
malts
with
a
bready
finish
loses
a
half
a
star
for
a
lasting
aftertaste
but
im
in
a
hotel
and
drinking
it
out
of
a
paper
cup
not
the
way
god
intended
this
beer
is
like
silk
another
good
offering
from
new
belgium
not
fantastic
but
a
solid
effort
this
is
my
first
belgian
dark
ale
so
i
dont
know
how
it
compares
to
others
it
tasted
a
lot
like
a
light
porter
d
high
but
the
sweetness
might
make
some
a
little
sick
after
the
third
or
fourth
o
decent
dark
ale
though
not
as
strong
as
id
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
type
dark
mediocre
overall
taste
and
bland
finish
dont
help
this
beer
but
its
a
nice
mellow
dark
when
you
dont
want
a
big
stout
or
a
belgian
strong
dark
d
could
and
did
drink
another
one
its
possible
the
fact
that
it
was
consumed
after
a
12
hour
car
ride
made
it
taste
better
but
i
still
think
i
would
drink
it
again
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
nb
supremely
drinkable
the
flavors
are
rather
mild
compared
to
a
porter
or
other
dark
beers
but
its
drawn
out
balanced
and
full
throughout
the
entire
experience
d
not
great
for
only
5
6
abv
dry
coffee
is
a
little
much
needs
something
to
balance
it
out
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
great
for
sitting
around
a
fire
on
a
cold
night
or
having
with
dessert
after
dinner
overall
it
was
a
delicious
beer
that
had
good
undertones
through
my
pleasurable
12
oz
of
this
1554
black
ale
its
one
that
i
can
drink
a
few
in
a
sitting
and
not
get
tired
of
it
i
recommend
it
for
people
with
acquired
taste
and
understand
the
marvels
of
black
ales
well
wow
been
drinking
this
for
years
never
really
stopped
to
analyze
it
good
beer
nice
balance
between
complexity
and
drinkability
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
where
you
want
to
keep
a
six
on
hand
just
in
case
fine
stuff
there
is
just
not
much
there
in
this
beer
it
reminds
me
why
i
dont
drink
new
belgium
beers
very
often
the
highlight
of
this
beer
is
its
smoothness
for
how
dark
it
is
but
overall
it
is
not
interesting
this
is
a
beer
for
someone
who
wants
to
pretend
they
are
drinking
a
good
beer
but
dont
actually
like
beer
dthis
is
the
1st
black
ale
ive
had
will
give
a
few
more
black
ales
a
try
but
it
wasnt
my
favorite
style
definatly
drinkable
but
the
flavor
just
wasnt
there
for
me
m
d
dry
but
a
tinge
of
sweetness
there
slightly
creamy
the
low
abv
and
the
lack
of
too
much
sweetness
with
the
chocolate
make
for
an
easy
drinkable
beer
interesting
dr
for
the
price
and
5
6
abv
its
alright
dont
expect
anything
incredible
it
wont
lift
your
kilt
up
anyway
pretty
drinkable
beer
it
grew
on
me
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
glass
not
too
bad
at
all
like
a
mellow
porter
pretty
light
body
and
dialed
down
flavors
d
the
taste
is
the
highlight
which
is
the
most
important
thing
no
off
characters
nice
balanced
brew
di
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
dinner
perhaps
but
i
wouldnt
get
them
for
a
night
of
boozing
quality
beer
but
nothing
really
special
this
tastes
like
what
i
expected
a
dark
beer
from
new
belgium
would
taste
faint
belgian
yeast
taste
in
the
background
of
a
drinkable
brown
ale
hints
of
wood
cinnamon
and
fig
smell
is
a
little
off
out
of
the
bottle
a
bit
glassy
but
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
high
i
would
file
this
one
under
a
pleasing
goto
beer
wouldnt
bring
it
to
a
tasting
but
id
be
happy
with
it
most
anytime
i
wanted
to
relax
with
a
mediumbodied
ale
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
reminds
me
of
turbodog
i
dont
know
if
there
is
anything
about
it
that
stands
out
other
than
its
very
smooth
and
very
good
overall
t
everything
about
this
beer
is
really
delicate
and
it
was
pretty
hard
to
pick
out
individual
elements
in
the
taste
i
could
definitely
detect
a
lot
of
bready
malts
along
with
yeast
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
and
some
smoke
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
the
mouthfeel
was
really
light
but
i
think
that
helped
more
than
hurt
the
flavors
of
the
beer
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
probably
not
one
i
would
rush
out
to
pick
up
again
its
not
really
my
type
of
thing
but
i
can
appreciate
the
effort
it
took
to
make
a
beer
like
this
its
lighter
and
less
tasty
than
a
schwarzbier
and
far
lighter
than
a
porter
but
it
is
related
to
those
two
in
a
couple
of
ways
it
will
appeal
to
a
lot
of
people
i
think
its
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
a
great
beer
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
d
this
one
is
one
my
favorites
from
new
belgium
i
can
typically
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
nice
flavor
great
price
and
light
mouthfeel
make
this
one
extremely
drinkable
dont
get
me
wrong
not
the
most
amazing
beer
ive
had
but
highly
drinkable
chocolate
and
light
roast
in
the
nose
absent
mocha
however
with
some
light
grass
and
pale
malts
coming
in
under
the
intense
nuts
sweetish
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
a
slighter
hint
of
smoke
nearpitch
ruby
with
a
creamy
superbly
rocky
and
lasting
tan
head
watery
body
is
very
creamy
very
sweet
with
medium
carbonation
a
little
stale
nuttiness
hints
of
berry
and
perhaps
star
anise
mostly
malty
under
the
earthy
chocolate
touch
of
acidity
light
caramel
some
crushed
almondy
shells
and
faint
cherries
and
man
the
nuts
are
all
over
this
thing
little
mintyherbal
swipe
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
and
i
will
not
buy
it
again
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
with
a
slightly
tanned
head
head
is
about
a
finger
high
with
average
retention
and
some
nice
lacing
as
it
goes
nose
is
mostly
roasty
malts
with
some
coffee
notes
taste
is
roasty
malt
again
with
some
chocolate
and
fruit
notes
to
round
things
out
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
however
i
think
this
speaks
more
to
the
impressive
appearance
than
any
deficit
in
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
high
again
not
as
cloying
sticky
or
boozey
as
you
would
expect
just
looking
at
this
i
love
how
this
beer
combines
drinkability
with
bold
taste
its
always
a
great
surprise
to
find
a
dark
beer
that
is
drinkable
and
not
over
powering
there
is
a
smoothness
to
1554
and
a
rich
chocolaty
finish
1554
is
another
dark
beer
ill
put
on
my
list
for
a
cold
evening
perfect
beer
for
a
little
football
with
some
brats
off
the
grill
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
as
this
was
my
first
belgium
dark
ale
great
for
the
dark
beer
lover
and
i
would
definitly
recommend
it
d
a
nice
brew
id
definitely
have
another
pours
a
dark
browndeep
red
color
just
a
bit
darker
yet
very
similar
to
the
moose
drool
i
just
drank
this
black
ale
is
not
black
smell
is
a
bit
yeasty
and
malty
also
hints
of
spice
and
fig
first
sip
is
highly
carbonated
dark
malt
flavors
but
its
almost
like
a
dirty
tar
taste
in
a
good
way
as
it
warms
the
residual
sweetness
finishes
with
a
bitter
tang
that
doesnt
leave
the
best
after
taste
i
suppose
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
consider
drinking
another
d
if
i
didnt
want
to
just
sit
and
enjoy
the
flavors
id
drink
it
alot
quicker
a
well
rounded
beer
worth
trying
again
for
sure
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
well
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
for
less
than
6
abv
this
brew
has
a
slight
warming
effect
to
it
which
is
unexpected
and
welcomed
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
experience
however
the
lingering
mustiness
of
this
brew
did
not
pair
well
with
the
other
flavorings
that
were
included
still
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
d
i
am
a
big
fan
of
new
belgiums
trippel
and
abbey
beers
i
was
very
disappointed
by
this
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
tarted
up
fat
tire
d
a
solid
black
ale
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
great
for
those
nights
when
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
an
ris
but
still
want
something
dark
overly
a
decent
beer
poured
into
my
new
belgium
globe
has
a
black
color
but
light
compared
to
stouts
a
fizzy
head
the
aroma
has
a
light
smell
but
some
coco
and
coffee
notes
some
aromatic
notes
and
a
light
licoricerosy
nose
the
taste
is
better
with
more
bready
and
coco
notes
some
roast
notes
a
bit
more
malty
as
it
warms
easy
drinking
nice
finish
doesnt
particularly
stand
out
in
anyway
but
its
good
i
like
it
and
im
going
to
drink
it
dits
not
a
heavy
beer
at
5
6
its
pretty
drinkable
to
begin
with
throw
in
the
fact
that
its
a
very
likable
beer
i
could
see
me
drinking
a
few
of
these
a
night
d
very
drinkable
for
the
type
of
beer
it
is
would
definitely
enjoy
this
one
again
especially
for
the
price
d
no
alcohol
warming
so
i
guess
you
could
drink
several
generally
one
black
beer
is
enough
for
me
d
very
drinkable
good
with
rich
desserts
at
the
first
sip
all
i
could
think
was
smooth
and
then
the
nice
chocolate
malt
kicked
in
a
very
nice
drinkable
blacl
lager
that
looks
as
dark
as
a
robust
porter
but
without
the
overwhelming
burntroast
aroma
and
taste
this
beer
is
a
party
in
a
six
pack
for
the
discriminating
drinker
id
love
to
try
in
on
tap
81st
drinkability
this
is
my
favorite
new
belgium
brews
some
small
things
need
to
be
modified
to
enhance
the
drinking
experience
though
new
belgium
might
want
to
consider
bottle
conditioning
for
this
beer
to
enhance
its
head
and
maybe
adding
more
malt
to
1554
more
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
bad
beer
dabbling
this
beer
at
my
desk
in
santa
cruz
california
the
first
this
i
notice
is
the
sweetness
i
wouldnt
normally
expect
from
a
dark
ale
not
quite
as
sweet
as
guinness
but
something
comperable
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
flavors
are
a
little
watered
but
this
makes
for
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
at
5
60
abv
its
an
easy
going
drinking
beer
or
could
easily
complement
a
marinara
sauce
or
sausage
though
this
is
definately
an
ale
taste
im
peeved
when
a
dark
ale
or
stout
beer
is
too
bitter
and
not
malty
enough
this
beer
has
exceeded
my
expectations
the
body
is
moderate
some
hints
of
astringency
but
no
where
near
what
should
be
with
this
dark
of
a
beer
some
lingering
yeasty
notes
but
overall
very
clean
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
heavy
it
feels
like
youre
drinking
a
beer
much
stronger
than
it
is
not
sure
if
thats
good
or
bad
but
it
feels
more
filling
than
it
really
is
pitch
black
with
a
slight
amber
hue
that
shines
through
lightly
nice
looking
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
minimal
covering
and
manages
to
leave
some
decent
lacing
some
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
with
some
slight
sweetness
as
well
bakers
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
come
through
in
the
taste
along
with
a
peculiar
nuttiness
that
seems
common
in
new
belgiums
ales
followed
by
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
that
quickly
retreats
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watered
downcarbonation
is
on
the
low
end
while
the
beer
itself
is
extremely
smooth
creamy
and
refreshing
as
drinkable
as
this
is
im
happy
that
belgian
ales
evolved
since
the
age
of
spanish
rule
in
flanders
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
because
it
has
a
low
amount
of
alcohol
and
isnt
filling
at
all
d
this
is
definitely
a
session
beer
but
with
some
class
you
can
down
plenty
of
these
and
feel
better
than
the
rest
of
the
crowd
who
might
be
drinking
down
pbr
while
i
wouldnt
necessarily
want
to
knock
back
a
bunch
of
these
it
is
a
tasty
brew
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
dvery
easy
drinking
but
not
especially
impressive
and
not
like
any
belgian
ive
had
seemed
more
like
an
altbier
bock
or
schwarzbier
although
im
certain
lager
yeast
was
not
used
than
a
belgian
poured
into
a
mug
gorgeous
black
beer
with
over
an
inch
high
head
that
lingers
lots
of
creamy
sticky
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
malty
and
toasty
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
wonderful
roasted
malt
with
coffee
accents
and
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
not
too
much
very
drinkable
beer
not
heavy
and
chewy
like
a
stout
surprisingly
light
for
such
a
dark
beer
you
could
enjoy
several
of
these
easily
if
you
like
a
stout
especially
a
chocolate
or
cream
you
have
got
to
try
this
it
is
similar
but
without
the
heaviness
definitely
recommend
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
im
glad
ive
tried
it
but
im
sure
there
are
better
beers
in
this
category
out
there
id
buy
it
again
but
not
before
trying
others
great
beer
new
belgium
brewing
d
great
i
forgot
how
mush
i
like
1554
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
on
new
belgium
products
but
this
is
a
standout
dark
but
way
too
drinkable
still
one
of
their
best
d
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
this
beer
again
i
can
however
see
why
it
appeals
to
a
larger
micro
drinking
market
falls
into
the
dark
beer
category
for
many
folks
d
there
is
nice
drinkability
here
i
like
this
a
lot
more
than
fat
tire
that
said
it
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
either
o
a
good
stand
by
and
a
beer
that
serves
a
purpose
especially
as
the
weather
cools
as
someone
who
prefers
american
stoutsporters
i
can
see
the
merit
of
this
beer
dark
pour
with
foamy
tan
head
this
smells
like
spicy
roast
malt
with
a
touch
of
soap
i
found
the
taste
pleasantsweet
fruity
malt
with
some
roast
character
and
some
cocoa
at
the
endbut
also
curiously
flattasting
although
the
carbonation
is
creamy
and
its
very
drinkable
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
extremely
memorable
d
quite
drinkable
more
than
one
might
expect
it
goes
down
rather
well
there
is
some
lingering
taste
but
its
light
enough
for
multiple
certainly
one
of
new
belgiums
better
brews
in
my
eyes
pours
dark
brown
very
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nice
smell
slightly
hoppy
with
some
caramel
smell
tastes
pretty
darn
good
nice
and
malty
cant
taste
any
hops
really
smooth
no
bite
with
appropriate
levels
of
carbonation
totally
drinkable
a
little
pricey
for
what
you
get
but
its
the
first
black
ale
ive
ever
had
so
i
think
its
pretty
good
12oz
bottle
at
shellfish
in
port
lavaca
tx
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thin
short
lasting
tanned
head
aroma
is
light
of
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
and
some
nuts
medium
body
with
dark
fruit
and
espresso
coffee
fill
the
mouth
finish
is
medium
taste
like
a
good
porter
to
me
i
figured
this
was
worth
a
return
visit
after
a
few
years
it
pours
a
clear
garnetbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
figs
brown
sugar
nutmeg
belgian
yeast
and
rye
bread
the
taste
brings
more
of
the
same
along
with
an
underlying
flavor
of
cocoa
the
body
is
a
lightish
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
nice
little
belgian
dark
a
decent
inexpensive
alternative
to
more
impressive
and
involved
belgians
im
struggling
with
why
this
is
called
a
belgian
dark
ale
reminds
me
more
of
a
stout
but
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
i
find
it
tasty
not
what
i
would
consider
a
classic
example
of
the
style
but
an
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
poured
a
dark
chestnut
some
moderate
caramel
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
that
went
a
bit
dry
with
creeping
astringency
finish
was
a
distinctive
unsweetened
cocoa
powder
note
that
was
quite
interesting
first
of
all
i
am
convinced
that
all
new
belgium
brewerys
beers
have
a
tastes
like
sticks
taste
i
believe
it
is
commonly
referred
to
as
earthy
to
continue
my
rant
i
think
this
beer
actually
has
a
campfire
taste
i
suppose
i
appreciated
the
smoky
aspect
for
something
different
half
way
through
i
had
a
buckeye
chocolate
and
peanut
butter
candy
which
was
a
nice
compliment
it
poured
black
with
one
finger
of
head
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
chocolate
coffee
caramel
and
smoke
it
was
a
little
sweeter
than
i
typically
prefer
so
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
row
i
only
bought
two
of
these
in
a
mixsix
but
i
can
see
myself
buying
a
six
pack
of
these
in
the
future
d
pretty
good
drinkability
its
not
quite
a
4
for
me
there
is
something
about
it
where
i
cant
have
multiples
but
one
is
pretty
tasty
and
goes
down
well
it
just
seems
like
something
is
missing

a

of

better
regular
offerings
easy
to

felt
like
a

out
the

nothing

worth

try
1554
is
black
with
mahogany
highlights
and
sports
a
khaki
head
malty
aroma
from
this
dark
beer
is
no
surprise
but
theres
also
chocolate
caramel
cocoa
and
its
a
touch
vinous
full
bodied
mouthfeel
thats
pretty
smooth
with
carbonation
along
the
edges
the
taste
has
a
delicious
chocolate
maltiness
to
it
along
with
hints
of
tobacco
hops
are
pretty
light
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
with
food
it
would
make
a
great
dinner
beer
d
very
drinkable
light
but
full
of
flavor
this
deep
dark
black
ale
is
supposedly
based
on
a
500
year
old
belgian
recipe
and
its
an
unusual
and
tasty
ale
that
doesnt
easily
fit
into
a
category
i
get
a
roasty
chocolate
scent
which
gives
way
to
a
burnt
chocolate
palate
not
as
spicy
as
a
traditional
belgian
abbey
ale
and
more
akin
to
a
softer
gentler
stout
its
not
snappy
or
hoppy
but
subtle
smooth
and
quite
tasty
this
ones
a
delightful
brew
with
a
unique
personality
1554
is
mediumbodied
and
has
a
crisp
taste
and
feel
its
more
of
a

so
not
heavy
it
has
decent

for

all
in
all
a
pretty
good
beer
probably
not
one
i
would
seek
or
purchase
regularly
but
one
i
would
gladly
accept
if
offered
by
a
friend
d
a
nice
dark
ale
for
a
winter
evening
ive
been
drinking
this
regularly
since
it
showed
up
in
the
grocery
store
the
flavor
is
a
bit
less
complex
than
id
hoped
for
but
quite
drinkable
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
if
you
like
sparkling
water
and
dark
session
beers
then
this
one
would
be
a
great
one
to
try
for
me
its
nothing
special
just
a
good
easy
drinker
d
very
drinkable
and
similar
to
a
stout
4
d
very
very
drinkable
must
say
this
beer
surprised
me
cause
i
didnt
enjoy
fat
tire
hardly
at
all
i
think
the
1554
might
be
a
beer
i
start
going
to
get
at
the
local
kroger
due
to
price
and
over
all
taste
will
continue
to
drink
over
and
over
nice
lacing
down
the
bottle
the
balance
is
about
perfect
no
unexpected
unwelcomed
flavors
to
speak
of
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
will
recommend
to
some
of
my
stout
and
porter
drinker
friends
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
has
some
pretty
good
retention
the
nose
brings
forward
some
light
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
slightly
roasty
with
some
dates
plum
and
chocolate
good
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
levels
drinks
nice
and
easy
d
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
makes
a
very
good
dinner
beer
might
even
consider
this
a
porter
will
have
to
sample
this
one
again
d
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
will
drink
this
one
again
not
so
black
as
so
much
deep

could
have

reviews
good
drinkability
i
would
seek
this
out
again
not
sure
about
the
classification
on
this
beer
i
thought
kinda
of
a
cross
between
brown
ale
and
porter
tasty
none
the
less
drink
is
high
this
is
something
i
give
to
friends
whos
craft
beer
of
choice
is
fat
tire
its
my
thought
that
this
is
the
bridge
to
portersstouts
22
oz
bottle
brewed
with
a
light
lager
yeast
as
per
the
website
pours
quite
near
black
with
lightish
carbonation
a
halfinch
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
smells
chocolatey
and
roasty
with
a
faint
note
of
hops
pretty
much
the
same
on
the
palate
but
with
a
light
earthiness
and
some
green
noble
hops
that
emerge
as
it
warms
light
and
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
i
thought
this
was
rather
more
like
a
porter
than
a
belgian
ale
but
then
again
they
arent
aiming
for
a
modernday
belgian
anyway
i
judged
this
one
as
a
porter
and
found
it
to
be
a
very
pleasing
ale
new
belgium
1554
is
something
of
an
odd
brew
it
strikes
me
as
a
cross
between
a
porter
scottish
ale
with
notions
of
a
barleywine
not
bad
but
their
other
beers
ive
tried
have
impressed
me
more
d
ok
im
not
all
that
impressed
the
flavors
are
very
subdued
and
muddled
you
could
tell
me
this
was
a
poor
attempt
at
smoked
porter
or
a
coffee
stout
and
i
would
believe
you
aside
from
the
funk
in
the
nose
and
the
faintest
hint
of
it
in
the
taste
its
hard
to
tell
that
there
is
anything
recognizably
belgian
in
there
t
balanced
flavor
but
with
no
strong
flavor
elements
does
finish
strong
d
nice
and
smooth
sailing
for
the
dark
ale
lover
easy
to
drink
easy
to
swallow
wouldnt
be
a
problem
drinking
more
than
one
in
an
evening
di
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
theres
just
nothing
there
the
smell
reminded
me
of
spent
coffee
grounds
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
aroma
but
on
the
thin
side
it
had
an
earthy
coffee
quality
mixed
with
a
slight
pale
aftertaste
overall
i
think
the
taste
did
not
live
up
to
its
aroma
it
was
good
and
ill
probably
still
drink
this
at
bars
as
an
alternative
to
the
other
overly
mainstream
beers
1554
pours
a
very
dark
brown
just
a
little
short
of
being
able
to
be
called
black
plenty
of
ruby
highlights
when
i
hold
it
up
to
light
a
vigorous
pour
yields
a
decent
but
not
spectacular
beige
head
lacing
and
retention
are
serviceable
but
not
noteworthy
the
nose
is
pungent
of
plum
with
just
a
hint
of
roastchocolate
pretty
intriguing
the
taste
is
just
that
but
a
little
bit
better
dark
fruit
and
dark
chocolate
make
a
beautiful
combination
though
its
mostly
the
former
and
just
a
hint
of
the
latter
the
roasted
character
is
just
barely
present
and
adds
something
to
the
beer
and
im
glad
that
they
managed
to
keep
any
coffee
notes
from
creeping
in
strike
that
as
some
coffee
starts
to
come
through
a
little
bit
once
the
beer
warms
body
is
impressively
rich
for
a
beer
of
just
5
6
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
lacking
overall
a
solid
and
unique
effort
from
new
belgium
a
pleasure
to
have
in
my
glass
jd
drinkability
is
good
i
drank
the
whole
vegas
bottle
on
vacation
at
a
va
state
park
cabin
watching
the
rain
from
a
dry
spot
in
the
woods
with
a
big
glass
of
this
beer
very
nice
this
is
a
staple
type
of
beer
to
enjoy
without
getting
wasted
drinkability
average
nothing
too
special
about
this
beverage
probably
wont
revisit
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
love
the
1554
as
an
every
occasion
dark
beer
d
not
too
great
one
and
done
for
sure
i
want
to
be
a
fisherman
in
a
colonial
n
c
coastal
town
and
have
an
old
salty
tavern
by
the
docks
that
serves
this
beer
as
the
house
draft
amidst
the
smell
of
wood
old
ropes
and
crab
traps
big
flavor
and
goes
down
easy
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
dark
beers
but
this
pretty
drinkable
im
always
impressed
with
new
belgium
i
expected
1554
to
be
similar
to
guinness
but
was
pleasantly
different
much
less
bitter
much
smoother
going
down
its
a
little
ashy
medium
body
creamy
body
its
just
ok
a
perfectly
fine
belgian
stout
not
sweet
up
front
no
bitterness
mild
coffee
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
best
before
date
is
october
24th
pours
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
light
brown
head
that
quickly
dissipates
minimal
lacing
interesting
rich
malt
aroma
chocolate
and
toffee
with
just
a
hint
of
coffee
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
seems
a
bit
heavy
for
only
5
6
abv
but
the
finish
is
clean
enough
to
still
make
it
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
texture
the
malt
lacks
some
personality
on
the
palate
though
a
little
bit
of
coffee
flavor
comes
through
but
other
than
that
its
just
medium
roasted
malt
taste
i
would
much
rather
this
were
a
little
lighter
it
might
make
a
good
session
beer
then
d
complex
enough
and
quite
drinkable
as
well
given
its
mouthfeel
and
cleanliness
the
5
6
abv
is
a
plus
as
well
for
those
looking
to
turn
the
complex
enlightenment
into
a
session
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
a
cool
latesummer
evening
a
very
good
beer
nice
beer
with
a
little
extra
head
to
it
but
that
isnt
bad
at
all
taste
of
hops
is
wonderful
but
at
the
very
end
a
tad
bitter
smells
crisp
drinkability
is
good
but
after
a
couple
one
will
probably
get
tired
of
it
i
do
recommend
this
beer
to
the
average
beer
drinker
the
body
is
medium
smooth
and
slick
taste
wise
it
leans
on
the
sweet
side
and
has
a
vanilla
plus
sassafras
and
leans
towards
the
bready
sweetness
found
in
the
aroma
on
tap
at
the
brewery
a
few
weeks
back
it
seems
the
brewery
has
changed
its
policy
regarding
samples
and
now
gives
out
a
few
tokens
to
each
adult
used
one
of
them
for
this
beer
which
i
like
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
decent
head
nice
roasted
malt
character
with
a
hint
of
coffee
a
little
chocolate
and
some
light
bitterness
very
porterlike
and
very
drinkable
so
bottom
line
good
beer
just
not
complex
at
all
for
tasting
cant
say
i
loved
it
but
the
cocoa
presence
helped
boost
it
a
bit
wish
there
was
even
more
the
typical
belgian
dark
mix
of
dark
fruits
baking
spices
booze
is
not
one
im
superfond
of
but
it
wasnt
played
up
too
highly
here
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
id
rush
to
have
another
md
it
is
thicker
than
expected
and
very
creamy
a
pretty
tasty
brew
that
i
would
drink
again
probably
12
max
per
night
though
d
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
tasty
easy
on
the
stomach
fairly
light
i
wouldnt
go
as
far
as
calling
it
sessionable
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
another
great
one
from
new
belgium
cheers
was
dark
not
black
i
guess
thats
what
they
meant
by
enlightened
smell
was
good
sweet
with
chocolate
of
course
little
coffee
and
some
kinda
fruit
which
was
back
seat
for
sure
taste
was
awesome
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
will
go
here
again
for
sure
getting
to
like
this
stye
oh
boy
i
could
certainly
imagine
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
dark
pub
four
and
a
half
centuries
ago
or
right
now
d
nice
session
belgian
great
carbonation
very
nice
beer
d
some
unique
flavours
but
a
little
too
bitter
and
sour
for
my
liking
wouldnt
drink
a
ton
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
overall
this
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
drinkable
beer
that
new
belgium
has
put
out
thus
far
its
a
beautiful
thing
finally
got
to
try
some
new
belgiums
while
on
vacation
really
enjoyed
the
1554
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
very
very
dark
brown
practically
black
except
when
backlit
nice
aroma
more
nutty
in
both
smell
and
taste
than
i
was
expecting
malt
dominant
with
some
nice
chocolate
and
coffee
undertones
the
nuttiness
is
present
throughout
and
adds
alot
really
enjoyed
the
alcohol
level
as
i
was
able
to
session
a
few
during
the
evening
with
no
effect
good
mouthfeel
helped
it
go
down
smooth
wish
i
could
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
easy
drinking
tasty
but
lacking
a
bit
of
depth
d
i
like
this
one
so
does
the
girlfriend
thats
high
praise
since
shes
a
finicky
b
final
notes
an
excellent
choice
for
a
session
beer
or
to
pair
with
food
or
even
a
dessert
this
beer
has
so
many
potential
uses
a
great
utility
beer
d
will
not
go
down
very
well
if
consumed
too
quickly
but
at
the
right
serving
conditions
it
is
an
excellent
offering
this
is
an
okay
beer
its
not
great
its
not
terrible
just
well
made
and
drinkable
the
beer
is
a
little
bland
for
a
brewery
that
makes
interesting
beers
the
malt
dominants
the
beer
with
germanstyle
munich
malt
breadiness
being
the
predominant
flavor
hops
are
there
just
for
bittering
there
is
a
bit
of
belgian
character
but
overall
its
lacking
the
complexity
and
interest
i
would
have
liked
dark
color
deep
brown
bordering
on
solid
black
with
a
slight
head
slight
estery
smell
probably
the
yeast
and
a
dark
malr
aroma
dominate
the
taste
is
malt
dominated
with
chocolate
smoky
and
bready
malts
all
combining
into
a
rather
delicious
malt
base
no
hop
bitterness
to
be
found
the
only
flavor
that
combats
the
malt
is
the
interesting
yeast
flavors
of
the
beer
moderate
carbonation
with
a
dry
nutty
finish
very
drinkable
nb
brew
maybe
not
as
complex
as
their
other
belgiumstyle
beers
the
dubbel
and
trippel
but
a
very
good
and
sessionable
beer
i
found
that
this
beer
reminded
me
a
little
of
stones
smoked
porter
it
started
with
a
really
nice
1
5in
head
poured
in
a
pint
glass
the
aromatics
were
very
woodsy
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
undertone
the
first
sip
the
beer
came
straight
out
of
the
fridge
and
it
was
approximately
38
was
very
nutty
with
a
chocolate
underlay
as
the
beer
warmed
up
it
was
approximately
50
when
i
finished
the
chocolate
underlay
became
more
prevalent
new
belgium
recommended
that
the
beer
be
served
at
45
in
a
snifner
style
beer
glass
i
can
definately
understand
why
the
temperature
and
the
difference
in
glass
ware
will
make
a
huge
aromatic
and
taste
difference
this
is
an
american
version
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
while
it
is
not
bad
it
pales
in
comparison
to
true
belgian
dark
ales
the
abv
is
pretty
low
for
a
belgian
5
5
and
is
relatively
average
there
is
nothing
to
distinguish
or
differentiate
this
beer
from
the
others
in
its
category
mouthfeel
drinkability
medium
bodied
and
chewy
modest
carbonation
makes
it
easy
to
down
this
one
and
since
dark
drinkable
lagers
are
few
and
far
between
in
the
states
the
1554
is
a
godsend
to
someone
like
me
who
loves
the
style
but
who
has
been
forced
to
drink
stale
spaten
dunkels
now
i
can
can
get
a
fresh
dark
lager
that
has
a
low
enough
abv
to
enjoy
over
an
evening
yippee
d
very
easy
to
drink
gives
just
enough
flavor
to
be
intriguing
but
is
not
overbearing
or
over
powering
could
drink
several
pints
if
needed
too
hah
if
needed
d
this
one
is
a
little
different
almost
like
a
light
belgian
stout
very
drinkable
with
an
almost
sessionable
abv
i
liked
this
one
more
than
i
expected
to
d
love
love
love
if
one
is
good
and
two
is
better
20
ought
to
do
at
the
flying
saucer
in
memphis
tn
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
one
finger
of
beige
decent
retention
and
very
good
lacing
lots
of
biscuit
caramel
and
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
as
the
flavor
crisp
on
the
palate
with
a
nutty
finish
and
aftertaste
thick
and
modestly
carbonated
definitely
a
sipping
beer
had
this
beer
from
a
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pintstyle
glass
just
yesterday
my
notes
on
it
are
as
follows
apoured
w
a
scarce
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
color
is
exceptionally
dark
but
not
completely
black
it
has
some
reddish
highlights
on
the
edges
and
bottom
sa
pronounced
dark
malt
smell
that
reminds
me
of
chocolate
malt
or
maybe
black
patent
malt
tis
very
true
to
the
smell
the
taste
is
dark
chocolate
that
is
rounded
out
nicely
by
the
bitterness
i
cant
place
the
hops
though
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
i
will
be
trying
this
one
again
great
offering
from
new
belgium
brewery
serving
type
ontap
poured
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
nice
ywo
finger
head
minimal
lacing
down
the
glass
smelled
slightly
sweet
roasted
malt
taste
was
very
smooth
not
as
sweet
or
as
roasted
as
the
smell
hinted
but
a
nice
porterlike
flaovor
mouthfeel
was
good
and
drinkability
is
high
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
appearance
of
the
body
sweet
caramel
notes
make
for
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brown
with
a
pretty
good
sized
head
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
and
glass
smell
is
mild
roasted
malt
not
overly
sweet
toasty
some
chocolate
notes
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
finishes
dry
quaffable
overall
a
nice
lighter
pseudobelgian
d
very
drinkable
as
the
flavors
are
all
there
and
all
blend
well
together
and
the
lower
abv
helps
as
well
this
is
overall
a
very
wellrounded
beer
a
complex
richness
compressed
and
made
thin
subtle
a
lot
of
my
friends
dont
care
much
for
this
brew
but
i
really
enjoy
it
i
recommend
this
is
my
first
taste
of
anything
from
this
company
and
i
am
impressed
pouring
a
nice
medium
dark
color
it
looked
excellent
in
the
glass
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
chocolatey
malt
aroma
and
taste
feels
good
in
the
mouth
and
going
down
low
alcohol
content
screams
hey
have
another
so
i
did
very
interesting
ring
just
below
neck
of
bottle
d
very
good
dark
ale
that
is
easy
to
drink
it
is
not
as
heavy
as
i
thought
it
might
be
not
a
bad
beer
but
lacking
the
complexity
of
a
true
belgian
ale
it
does
go
down
nice
and
easy
and
the
relatively
low
abv
means
you
dont
have
to
be
as
careful
with
this
one
as
some
others
highly
drinkable
and
very
pleasant
this
was
like
a
less
complex
version
of
black
butte
porter
which
aint
a
bad
thing
okay
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
or
glass
of
beer
still
very
decent
for
a
beer
style
that
often
struggles
to
impress
the
palate
opens
with
a
moderate
sweetness
quite
caramel
in
nature
in
some
ways
it
makes
me
think
of
a
brown
ale
with
the
caramel
toffee
and
cocoa
very
well
balanced
moderately
spicy
midpalate
this
beer
dries
off
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
toasted
nut
caramel
and
spice
character
quite
bready
the
combination
of
spice
and
cocoa
makes
me
think
of
pumpernickel
bread
the
american
variant
lightly
fruity
as
well
the
yeast
character
is
light
and
apart
from
the
spice
i
dont
get
much
else
medium
light
in
body
with
a
creamy
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
the
pleasure
on
the
palate
with
a
pleasant
balance
of
flavors
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
of
this
unseasonably
cool
summer
evening
im
not
particularly
enamored
by
fat
tire
but
this
is
one
beer
i
wish
we
got
here
in
dc
light
to
medium
bodied
moderately
firm
im
not
a
fan
d
for
the
price
bargain
and
its
not
bad
for
a
belgium
dark
there
is
could
be
room
for
a
lot
of
improvement
drinkability
creamy
and
smooth
like
a
hot
chocolate
very
drinkable
this
is
actually
one
of
my
old
goto
beers
due
to
its
wide
availability
in
bottle
at
least
sessionability
and
complexity
on
tap
it
was
different
maybe
a
hair
better
different
and
enjoyable
not
sure
i
could
have
drank
the
whole
bottle
though
d
its
a
good
beer
well
carbonated
for
a
darker
beer
which
i
dont
drink
dark
beer
very
often
its
very
easy
to
drink
for
one
or
two
but
after
a
couple
it
gets
harder
to
drink
drinking
these
all
night
would
be
tough
the
malted
flavor
is
a
very
nice
taste
and
makes
its
a
good
beer
drinkable
yes
i
lost
track
it
was
so
easy
to
drink
1554
is
not
a
heavy
dark
ale
enjoy
im
not
always
in
the
mood
for
this
type
of
beer
but
when
i
am
this
stuff
is
unbelievably
good
the
mouth
is
firm
some
good
carbonation
backing
and
a
smooth
finish
nice
nothing
in
the
flavor
really
stands
out
i
dont
notice
anything
that
specifies
this
as
belgian
in
the
flavor
its
got
some
semisweet
toffee
light
bitterness
and
a
mild
finish
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
was
sort
of
bland
in
the
process
expected
more
from
this
but
id
gladly
have
it
again
regardless
drinkability
3
5
could
drink
two
or
three
of
these
socially
any
more
would
probably
be
too
filling
d
cleaner
than
i
was
expecting
that
makes
sense
though
given
that
the
a
lager
yeast
was
used
it
does
seem
to
have
some
yeast
character
though
but
not
stereotypical
belgium
yeast
notes
more
like
lager
yeast
fermented
on
the
warm
side
not
really
sure
what
style
this
is
but
it
is
tasty
interesting
and
drinkable
esoteric
approachable
and
sort
of
piques
your
interest
kind
of
like
that
nerdy
chick
in
the
library
how
is
that
for
being
enlightened
delicious
malty
goodness
notes
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
love
dark
bread
and
this
beer
has
that
quality
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
true
belgian
dark
ale
but
it
has
good
dark
roasted
notes
while
being
light
this
is
an
easy
drinking
black
ale
it
comes
a
touch
closer
to
a
big
brown
ale
with
bits
of
roast
coming
through
in
the
aftertaste
not
quite
a
much
belgian
character
as
one
would
expect
but
this
doesnt
take
away
from
the
overall
beer
quite
enjoyable
really
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
had
only
had
it
in
the
past
on
draft
and
it
is
much
better
like
this
than
from
a
bottle
but
still
very
good
heavy
taste
with
a
light
feel
is
what
i
like
about
it
most
i
will
say
that
belgium
beers
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
like
this
one
for
sure
i
was
just
at
the
brewery
last
month
and
wished
i
would
have
reviewed
this
beer
fresh
on
draft
good
brewery
great
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
this
will
be
a
great
session
beer
when
fall
comes
around
overall
a
very
good
beer
from
new
belgium
perhaps
one
of
my
favorites
of
theirs
the
smell
and
taste
are
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
but
not
so
much
that
drinking
a
few
is
tiresome
this
being
the
first
belgian
dark
ale
that
i
have
tried
despite
having
many
belgian
strong
dark
ales
i
have
to
say
this
is
an
intriguing
and
enjoyable
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
with
lots
of
nuance
but
it
does
take
a
bit
a
contemplation
and
search
to
find
all
the
bits
and
pieces
although
this
is
only
the
second
time
i
have
had
anything
that
was
actually
impressive
from
this
brewery
la
folie
being
the
other
i
would
happily
purchase
this
readily
available
and
cheap
beer
again
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
fairly
straightforward
beer
not
saying
that
it
is
boring
its
just
not
bringing
anything
unique
to
the
table
this
is
a
great
session
beer
for
the
stout
loverlike
myself
who
crave
something
less
filling
drinkability
smooth
brew
though
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
like
d
good
to
average
drinkability
this
was
not
excellent
making
me
beg
for
more
but
it
was
not
bad
either
i
probably
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
to
drink
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
giving
a
watery
feel
overall
1554
is
a
refreshing
example
of
an
underemployed
style
though
its
not
the
perfect
example
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
it
is
a
good
beer
and
not
something
youll
drink
everyday
ive
never
been
too
impressed
by
new
belgium
but
this
is
one
of
the
betters
beers
of
theirs
that
ive
tried
d
drinkable
yes
black
yes
but
not
what
i
feel
it
should
be
entirely
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
the
1554
is
full
in
flavor
yet
very
light
definately
a
good
session
beer
after
my
first
tastes
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
balance
and
flavor
definately
a
beer
id
buy
again
taste
nuts
coffee
chocolate
but
nothing
like
a
stout
minimal
coffee
lots
of
nuts
still
thin
bodied
recedes
throughout
the
bottle
one
of
the
most
drinkable
dark
colored
beers
made
in
america
mdmouthfeel
id
pretty
thin
but
not
watery
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
down
the
middle
of
the
road
beer
for
when
u
want
something
a
little
dark
and
richer
as
well
as
clean
and
crisp
md
i
felt
that
the
beer
felt
lighter
than
it
should
have
almost
watered
down
a
bit
the
carbonation
felt
right
which
helped
as
for
drinkability
i
poured
some
of
it
out
simply
because
i
forgot
about
it
overall
a
less
than
average
beer
and
one
that
i
would
not
buy
or
order
again
d
not
my
favorite
beer
easy
to
throw
a
bunch
back
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
but
if
available
id
grab
another
easy
drinkin
just
needs
more
flavor
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
of
light
roast
malt
with
some
raisin
and
some
chocolate
the
taste
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
thought
there
is
a
sweetness
of
dark
cherry
and
caramel
and
a
chocolate
finish
it
is
more
thin
that
i
would
have
expected
but
decent
carbonation
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
but
not
the
top
tier
i
have
had
in
other
belgian
brews
overall
a
functional
and
less
costly
version
of
this
style
good
work
from
new
belgium
but
not
world
class
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
or
many
try
it
dark
brown
with
a
small
off
white
head
smell
is
roasty
malts
and
dark
fruit
taste
starts
off
with
a
subtle
dark
fruitiness
followed
by
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
finish
is
a
bit
metallic
an
interesting
brew
that
is
unique
and
drinkable
enough
to
have
a
few
in
one
sitting
drinks
welldefinitely
sessionable
here
light
body
makes
it
go
down
easy
lots
of
flavor
and
leaves
me
craving
another
sip
best
choice
from
new
belgium
ive
tried
so
far
notes
my
all
time
favorite
porter
on
the
market
its
so
well
balanced
and
not
too
syrupy
or
sweet
also
as
mentioned
the
best
version
of
this
is
cask
d
this
is
session
worthy
although
the
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
begins
to
be
slightly
grating
i
dont
know
that
i
could
drink
these
consecutively

definitely
throw
back
with
a
few
of
these
without
being
overwhelmed
freshness
date
0410
as
for
mouthfeel
its
got
a
thickness
to
it
that
ranks
right
below
a
porter
its
mouthfeel
really
helps
out
in
the
drinkability
department
making
this
a
somewhat
of
a
session
beer
to
more
experienced
drinkers
and
my
girlfriend
love
new
belgium
beers
overall
this
is
my
favorite
nb
beer
so
far
its
a
nice
easy
drinker
that
isnt
spectacular
but
is
very
solid
d
this
brews
drinkability
may
be
its
highlightwith
enough
taste
to
engross
and
a
relatively
light
body
this
is
undoubtedly
a
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
with
prickly
carbonation
easy
to
drink
overall
a
superb
brew
d
drinkability
is
good
this
is
probably
my
favorite
category
on
this
beer
i
would
have
no
problems
having
this
over
the
course
of
an
entire
session
granted
there
is
nothing
really
outstanding
here
and
it
probably
doesnt
fit
the
style
too
well
but
i
would
say
its
a
solid
brew
that
is
put
together
well
strange
sensation
late
chalky
reminds
me
of
something
i
felt
in
a
smoked
beer
recently
seemed
metallic
in
that
instance
but
less
so
now
will
definitely
have
this
beer
again
nice
dark
pour
into
my
glass
tannish
head
raises
from
the
beer
truthfully
i
am
a
bit
stuffed
to
pick
out
anything
still
smell
nice
though
taste
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
one
of
the
best
belgian
dark
beers
i
have
had
so
far
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
new
belgiums
beers
a
bit
thin
feeling
to
me
but
nice
and
creamy
none
the
less
i
would
have
loved
to
have
had
another
one
but
alas
it
was
my
only
one
d
a
decent
representation
of
the
belgian
dark
ale
brewing
style
i
could
drink
several
of
these
before
wanting
to
move
onto
something
else
props
to
new
belgium
for
a
good
brew
i
look
forward
to
sampling
your
other
offerings
first
found
in
the
folly
pack
and
now
seek
this
out
out
on
its
own
dont
like
the
lighter
varieties
as
much
the
beer
pours
a
thin
dark
brown
with
ruby
tints
and
a
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
it
pours
very
fizzy
with
large
bubbles
seen
rising
to
the
surface
from
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
isnt
very
strong
but
it
is
very
buscuity
with
some
roastedchocolate
notes
and
a
taste
to
match
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
malt
and
yeast
with
with
almost
no
hop
presence
as
others
have
stated
the
beer
is
rather
thin
but
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
creamy
considering
my
first
impressions
of
the
fizzyness
during
the
pour
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
enjoyable
beer
d
ok
beer
just
a
bit
underwhelming
this
colorado
brew
is
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
fair
offwhite
head
and
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
offers
solid
malt
raisin
and
wheat
maybe
some
chocolate
pretty
nice
the
flavor
brings
out
smokey
malt
with
a
touch
of
licorice
smooth
and
less
than
medium
bodied
quite
drinkable
light
tingly
carbonation
malt
is
king
here
very
tasty
along
the
lines
of
a
strong
brown
ale
good
stuff
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
new
belgium
im
not
a
fan
of
quite
a
few
of
their
beers
but
this
one
is
always
a
pleasant
drinker
my
pour
created
a
thick
mochabrown
head
that
would
make
any
selfrespecting
root
beer
float
envious
and
it
had
good
retention
for
its
two
fingers
nose
was
very
cocoachocolaty
color
was
deepbrown
with
ruby
highlights
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
taste
like
a
chocolate
milkshake
finish
was
dry
and
chocolaty
like
a
malted
milk
ball
chocolate
lovers
rejoice
overall
i
managed
to
drink
several
of
these
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
good
enough
to
keep
me
interested
a
session
beer
for
sure
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
has
amazing
taste
and
mouthfeel
if
you
get
a
chance
to
get
this
do
1554s
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
medium
carbonation
not
a
spectacular
beer
by
any
means
but
its
simplicity
and
balance
render
it
a
highlydrinkable
inexpensive
offering
d
interesting
beer
i
suppose
but
i
kept
wishing
it
was
a
dark
lager
or
stout
the
flavor
wasnt
the
best
but
i
like
the
idea
behind
the
beer
and
i
applaud
new
belgium
for
making
it
drinkability
sessionable
belgian
indeed
and
a
nice
overall
selecion
not
a
bad
gateway
for
newbees
to
get
into
darks
and
belgians
feeling
was
creamy
and
smoothy
liked
the
carbonation
but
didnt
pop
to
make
it
spicy
again
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
light
drink
nothing
special
but
could
be
an
all
day
drink
if
you
need
it
d
tastewise
i
would
definitely
session
this
but
im
a
little
guy
and
anything
over
about
5
tends
to
adversely
affect
me
if
i
session
it
so
on
those
grounds
id
probably
drink
this
all
day
but
slowly
nothing
extreme
but
would
make
a
great
intro
to
darker
beers
glad
to
have
tried
it
on
tap
d
very
drinkable
sessionable
would
definitely
pick
this
up
in
the
future
poured
into
a
snifter
left
12
of
head
very
dark
with
some
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
hardly
any
lacing
the
smell
is
certainly
not
overpowering
kind
of
sweet
and
nutty
tastes
woody
kind
of
like
smoked
wood
chips
theres
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
nice
and
bitter
malt
not
much
as
far
as
hops
the
carbonation
was
pretty
low
i
think
this
beer
is
best
for
warm
days
it
doesnt
look
like
a
summer
beer
but
i
think
i
enjoyed
it
more
after
coming
back
from
the
beach
when
its
cold
outside
i
feel
more
like
a
smoky
porter
with
a
higher
abv
d
a
decent
beer
i
kind
of
enjoyed
how
low
the
abv
is
on
this
this
would
make
for
a
fine
session
beer
finish
is
reasonably
clean
but
a
slight
roasted
flavor
lingers
afterward
good
fall
brew
worth
a
try
nice
kick
of
hops
in
a
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
black
ale
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
produces
a
5
mm
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
appearance
is
very
dark
almost
black
and
a
clear
dark
brown
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
delicious
with
sweet
chocolate
caramel
and
a
hint
of
coffee
maltiness
the
taste
is
similarly
delightful
with
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
and
chocolatey
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
drinkable
indeed
pours
a
very
dark
black
with
a
nice
thick
frothy
head
good
head
retention
has
an
aroma
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
taste
some
hints
of
coffee
with
a
smooth
chocolatey
finish
meduim
bodied
and
silky
smooth
this
is
a
great
brew
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
it
has
nice
flavors
but
everything
is
subtle
and
mellow
nothing
complex
going
on
here
but
certainly
is
easy
drinking
o
terrific
beer
and
amazingly
cheap
i
need
to
remember
to
always
keep
this
in
stock
for
company
overall
a
very
solid
brew
not
mindblowing
like
the
true
belgian
dark
ales
but
nonetheless
a
good
buy
and
worth
trying
at
the
least
id
gladly
drink
it
again
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
thin
feels
dry
drinkable
not
a
favorite
but
not
bad
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
more
than
i
did
i
had
only
had
fat
tire
before
which
i
know
is
not
considered
the
best
beer
from
this
brewery
so
i
was
excited
to
see
it
it
was
not
however
all
that
interesting
great
black
color
but
overall
not
much
in
the
way
of
belgian
character
drinkability
awesome
beer
very
mild
slightly
roasted
light
bitters
on
the
finish
which
is
a
very
enjoyable
direction
away
from
hop
bitterness
very
enjoyable
drinkability
sitting
at
only
5
5
abv
this
is
a
session
beer
for
sure
not
something
id
want
on
a
warm
day
or
maybe
thats
just
the
bowl
of
potato
leek
soup
that
i
made
talking
regardless
i
think
this
is
more
of
an
autumn
or
winter
beer
for
me
but
its
a
damn
fine
one
drinkablilty
is
quite
good
to
me
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
style
and
i
found
it
quite
delicious
i
wouldnt
mind
this
as
session
beer
nice
pleasing
flavors
not
bad
really
i
would
have
given
higher
marks
if
i
didnt
know
that
there
are
much
better
out
there
the
flavors
are
on
the
weak
side
mouth
is
somewhat
lacking
despite
decent
carbonation
overall
appeal
is
less
than
it
was
when
i
first
encountered
it
once
a
six
pack
standby
now
its
one
of
those
id
prefer
to
buy
on
sale
poured
ontap
about
a
finger
of
head
beautiful
deep
rich
black
color
it
doesnt
smell
nearly
as
good
as
it
tastes
there
are
hints
of
dark
coffee
and
rich
chocolate
with
some
toffee
this
is
a
much
richer
beer
then
i
would
normally
expect
from
a
5
5
i
could
certainly
drink
this
one
all
day
kind
of
looks
like
a
glass
of
coke
with
a
decent
cap
of
offwhite
foam
coating
the
top
i
have
to
try
really
hard
to
get
anything
from
the
aroma
mostly
i
notice
the
roasted
grain
smells
with
a
little
caramel
sweetness
in
the
background
tastes
of
cocoa
powder
bittersweet
chocolate
caramel
and
roasted
coffee
a
nice
bitterness
from
the
roast
flavors
couple
with
a
mild
hop
quality
it
coats
the
mouth
in
a
satisfactory
way
a
bit
sticky
and
cloying
on
the
finish
but
not
horrible
and
something
that
could
certainly
be
fixed
with
a
decent
food
pairing
of
the
nb
beers
ive
had
so
far
mothership
wit
and
fat
tire
being
the
other
two
this
one
is
certainly
the
better
of
the
three
in
my
opinion
and
the
one
im
drinking
has
actually
reached
its
drink
by
date
so
im
guessing
its
even
better
when
fresh
at
least
i
hope
so
at
any
rate
id
give
it
another
try
and
would
recommend
it
to
others
d
session
if
youre
in
the
darker
ale
mood
nothing
offensive
blends
well
with
most
meats
light
or
dark
or
chocolate
dessert
d
very
drinkable
didnt
know
what
i
was
to
expect
with
this
style
but
its
delicious
the
flavors
are
complex
and
interesting
but
none
of
them
overpower
the
others
damn
i
wish
i
had
another
tried
this
beer
number
of
times
and
rarely
pour
it
into
a
glass
the
colour
is
nice
and
dark
with
an
off
white
to
tan
head
smell
is
light
with
some
hints
of
malt
and
a
little
sweetness
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
being
very
light
for
the
style
the
lack
strong
carbonation
and
mild
flavours
make
this
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
many
settings
from
a
cold
day
with
comfort
food
to
a
warm
spring
day
by
the
grill
liked
it
not
too
hard
which
makes
sense
for
a
stout
lover
and
my
capability
to
drink
it
so
easily
from
notes
served
pretty
cold
deep
amber
with
ruby
very
clear
not
much
head
fades
to
film
and
ring
good
lacing
smell
not
too
much
grainy
malty
sweet
tame
taste
is
mild
grainymalty
touch
of
sweetness
clean
finish
feel
is
thin
benighn
clean
finish
easy
drinking
but
not
memorably
this
makes
for
a
decent
beer
to
usher
in
autumn
with
try
it
if
you
see
it
its
a
unique
beer
thatll
be
a
nice
change
up
to
your
daily
rotation
d
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
for
an
entire
night
but
certainly
a
good
rich
addition
to
any
night
of
tasting
i
believe
that
this
beer
is
misclassified
because
it
is
obvious
that
nb
was
trying
to
brew
an
oldschool
black
ale
nicely
done
really
mild
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
complexity
under
all
of
the
dark
fruit
this
actually
an
edit
of
a
prvious
review
first
time
i
rated
it
at
3
7
it
also
was
my
100th
beer
review
smell
yielded
a
nutty
scent
taste
reflected
that
smell
but
also
added
a
roasted
maltybiscuity
flavor
very
tasty
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
watery
sessionable
but
i
think
its
best
when
allowed
to
stand
on
its
own
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
and
i
may
try
it
over
a
cigar
this
time
around
rather
than
a
steak
in
addition
this
would
be
a
good
starter
beer
for
those
who
are
looking
to
try
darker
beers
one
of
new
belgiums
better
beers
and
it
doesnt
taste
of
apricots
drinkability
moderate
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
smells
and
tastes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
malt
with
bananas
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
mixed
with
slight
coffee
bitterness
medium
bodied
smooth
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
in
all
its
a
wonderful
brew
one
that
i
could
well
imagine
supping
for
a
long
time
as
a
winter
beer
but
equally
refreshing
in
our
early
california
autumn
d
a
drinkable
american
version
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
i
had
wanted
to
taste
this
beer
for
some
time
finally
found
it
at
a
gas
station
in
town
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
while
this
pours
a
pretty
dark
brown
it
really
falls
short
on
nose
and
flavor
sure
there
is
enough
roasty
malt
and
coffee
to
keep
me
interested
but
quite
honestly
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
outoftheordinary
this
is
most
unfortunately
quite
ordinary
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
low
abv
thus
making
the
brew
quite
sessionable
worth
trying
sure
will
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
thanks
to
fretlessman
over
at
realbeer
for
this
one
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
1554
appears
a
dark
chestnut
color
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
tan
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
rich
roasted
and
toasted
grains
bittersweet
chocolate
lightly
roasted
coffee
notes
slight
hints
of
smoke
caramel
a
tad
better
than
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
for
the
style
quite
nice
drinkability
pretty
high
due
to
the
low
abv
but
im
slowed
a
little
by
the
moderate
mouthfeel
good
beer
but
not
amazingly
so
id
have
another
definitely
drinkable
i
can
remember
more
than
one
party
where
i
swigged
down
one
after
another
of
these
the
new
belgium
uar
my
new
belgium
of
choice
dextremely
sessionable
and
enjoyable
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
quite
nice
unique
beer
very
much
worth
trying
and
would
have
again
every
once
in
a
while
probably
the
best
of
new
belgiums
normal
lineup
which
unfortunately
isnt
saying
much
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
roasted
malts
taste
is
very
sweet
up
front
chocolaty
a
hint
of
coffee
as
well
there
is
a
bit
of
artificial
sweetener
sweetness
that
is
a
bit
odd
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
nice
low
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
this
is
a
good
beer
from
nb
that
is
a
unique
style
i
would
drink
this
again
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
from
them
pours
a
dark
looking
ale
with
an
inviting
fluffy
head
light
reveals
it
to
be
an
auburn
blood
shade
good
lace
and
good
head
retention
smells
like
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
tastes
like
a
milder
smoked
porter
coffee
like
and
cocoa
finishes
sticky
aftertaste
gets
a
little
to
smokey
too
good
carbonation
mix
pretty
easy
to
drink
save
the
finish
not
bad
poured
to
a
nice
caramel
colored
head
had
some
very
nice
lacing
that
left
rings
with
every
swallow
brew
itself
was
very
dark
brown
to
almost
black
in
color
had
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
smell
also
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
tasted
like
it
smelled
had
that
roasted
malt
slightly
sweet
caramel
and
a
little
of
that
coffee
flavor
had
a
dry
aftertaste
all
tastes
were
mild
and
not
overpowering
i
think
it
was
pretty
well
balanced
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
right
this
ale
reminded
me
more
of
a
porter
that
wasnt
a
bad
thing
i
wouldnt
want
to
make
this
a
session
beer
but
a
few
would
sure
taste
good
now
and
then
im
very
impressed
with
1554
great
taste
mouthfeel
and
decent
carbonation
makes
this
a
great
session
choice
cheers
drinkability
its
drinkable
to
a
certain
extent
but
because
of
the
flavor
issues
i
cant
rate
it
very
high
drinkability
one
of
those
beers
i
can
go
round
after
round
a
good
standby
since
the
price
doesnt
hurt
much
and
it
is
drinkable
its
a
top
contender
for
my
goto
drinkability
very
drinkable
brew
would
seem
to
pair
well
many
different
foods
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
any
type
of
beer
drinker
not
sure
if
i
will
have
many
more
but
still
good
to
have
around
d
very
nice
brew
overall
which
met
my
expectations
i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
and
the
subtlety
of
the
flavors
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
havent
tried
too
many
new
belgiums
at
this
point
and
i
know
theyve
got
a
mixed
opinion
but
i
was
impressed
they
got
a
belgian
dark
in
wide
distribution
a
rock
solid
brew
with
good
distribution
a
sanctuary
beer
in
scarce
places
very
interesting
beer
as
homebrewer
i
would
increase
the
roast
and
chocolate
to
a
level
equal
of
the
fruit
and
grain
toast
rather
than
just
elusive
hints
hiding
amongst
the
tannic
finish
also
perhaps
increase
the
body
with
some
maltodextrins
without
increasing
sweetness
anyway
its
delicious
its
really
subtle
with
its
flavors
but
they
are
there
for
the
enjoying
if
you
care
to
look
drinkability
you
know
what
i
really
like
this
beer
its
not
especially
big
or
big
with
crazy
robust
flavors
but
just
a
simple
toasty
and
bready
maltiness
the
smell
is
solid
enough
and
lets
you
know
what
you
will
be
drinking
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
a
mild
abv
allows
one
to
get
through
a
couple
with
really
no
issues
whatsoever
notes
delicious
had
it
local
recommended
for
people
who
like
roasted
malts
overall
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
but
i
was
pleasently
suprised
i
really
like
the
somewhat
subtle
mellow
coffe
flavor
from
the
roasted
malt
i
would
probably
get
this
again
if
i
could
get
it
here
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
certainly
not
one
that
will
knock
you
off
of
your
feet
with
flavor
drew
a
nice
head
and
as
with
the
quality
brews
it
kept
on
keepin
on
it
was
blackamber
and
smelled
great
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
chocolate
malt
smell
it
tasted
very
light
i
was
suprised
since
it
was
so
light
the
aftertaste
is
the
nice
thing
about
this
beer
the
caramel
and
chocolatecoffee
tones
come
out
after
a
min
it
was
a
nice
smooth
drink
on
a
nice
hot
day
i
would
prob
drink
it
frequently
if
i
could
get
more
than
22
oz
bottles
but
i
guess
its
at
a
good
price
and
who
doesnt
like
to
down
a
whold
22
oz
bottle
all
at
once
dark
amber
very
nice
scent
yummy
looked
great
when
poured
with
some
residual
head
swirled
and
smelled
very
nice
malty
pleasents
taste
was
complex
and
simple
and
the
same
time
meaning
you
could
taste
the
different
ingredients
well
but
without
taking
over
the
beer
simple
to
drink
without
different
flavors
mixed
well
mouthfeel
was
pleasent
and
this
beer
was
easy
to
drink
again
yummy
served
in
a
chilled
glass
which
makes
appearance
a
little
more
difficult
to
evaluate
it
was
dark
brown
with
a
small
but
fluffy
cap
of
foam
straight
forward
malty
brew
through
and
through
roasty
chocolately
bready
no
bitterness
from
hops
no
burn
from
alcohol
it
was
nice
paired
with
my
meal
but
couple
with
the
food
to
be
quite
filling
decent
offering
from
nb
light
to
medium
body
but
pretty
smooth
flash
of
astringency
in
the
finish
gentle
to
moderate
carbonation
gives
tingle
helps
body
and
gives
flavor
lift
cheers
d
so
very
quaffable
satisfying
i
dunno
why
i
have
drug
my
feet
on
trying
this
beer
its
just
awesome
poured
a
very
nice
dark
brown
with
copper
tinges
a
nice
bit
of
initial
if
rapidly
fading
head
and
just
a
wee
bit
of
lacing
great
scent
a
subtle
mixture
of
great
sweet
malt
chocolate
flavors
floral
hints
and
a
nice
orangebanana
aroma
great
taste
starts
strong
with
chocolate
and
then
goes
into
an
excellent
bananacitrus
flavor
giving
it
a
nice
mixture
ends
with
a
huge
sweetness
on
the
tongue
but
with
enough
hops
to
keep
it
grounded
very
smooth
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
brew
well
ok
but
not
spec
drinkable
but
not
delicious
drinkability
this
was
my
second
1554
after
having
it
out
one
evening
when
new
belgium
first
came
to
sc
quite
drinkable
drinkability
good
d
not
bad
the
taste
is
pretty
inoffensive
low
abv
but
its
a
little
lacking
imo
not
really
the
robust
drinker
that
i
was
hoping
for
very
nice
brew
recommended
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
and
rather
enjoyable
d
a
tasty
and
interesting
brew
but
not
overly
memorable
goes
down
easy
and
could
prove
quite
sessionable
at
only
5
5
abv
d
a
tasty
and
complex
sipper
thats
thoroughly
enjoyable
if
this
enlightened
ale
is
evocative
of
black
brews
enjoyed
in
belgian
taverns
500
years
ago
i
may
have
been
born
five
centuries
too
late
new
belgium
1554
poured
a
dark
brownruby
color
with
large
tan
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
was
of
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
was
very
sweet
loaded
with
chocolate
flavors
mouthfeel
was
good
good
carbonation
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
filling
and
that
is
why
it
lost
some
on
the
drinkability
for
me
overall
though
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
nice
beer
i
enjoy
most
beers
i
have
had
from
new
belgium
and
this
was
no
different
d
very
drinkable
but
again
i
think
that
is
because
it
is
almost
too
subdued
quite
balanced
and
smooth
to
be
sure
doesnt
not
have
you
on
your
knees
begging
for
another
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
pass
up
an
offer
for
a
second
pretty
solid
i
would
say
very
tasty
i
would
like
to
get
it
on
tap
or
in
a
growler
some
day
this
beer
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
mediumlight
body
pretty
nice
beer
overall
and
at
3
5022oz
not
a
bad
deal
at
all
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
an
off
white
head
aroma
of
toasted
nuts
and
milk
chocolate
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
sweet
caramel
taste
with
a
light
chocolate
after
taste
gets
a
little
cloying
towards
the
end
but
overall
a
great
beer
pours
a
deep
rich
dark
brown
with
a
tan
dark
brown
light
head
with
tight
bubbles
smell
is
chocolatey
malty
caramely
hoppy
creamy
and
nutty
taste
is
very
smooth
and
nutty
spicy
and
hoppy
a
tad
floral
with
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
with
hazelnut
and
cream
cheese
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
with
decent
drinkability
not
the
greatest
evah
but
solid
d
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
and
enough
to
maintain
interest
i
have
to
admit
that
this
beer
is
absolutely
beautiful
in
the
glass
it
pours
a
beautiful
deep
dark
red
with
a
full
and
thick
beige
head
forming
there
is
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
very
malty
in
the
aroma
giving
off
scents
of
strong
chocolate
light
toffee
and
some
earth
a
light
bodied
beer
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
giving
way
to
some
strong
earthy
notes
finish
was
very
minimal
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
d
a
very
nice
beer
overall
beautiful
and
great
flavor
in
one
package
notes
very
nice
dark
ale
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
the
richness
means
it
is
something
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
in
a
session
though
this
brew
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
part
of
that
is
due
to
the
excellent
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
but
not
overly
bodied
this
beer
coats
your
mouth
nicely
but
then
subsides
to
a
rich
coffee
chocolate
malt
aftertaste
and
a
subtle
dryness
damn
fine
beer
and
damn
easy
to
drink
taste
was
good
slight
roastiness
hints
of
vanilla
but
having
a
more
noticeable
boozey
alcohol
taste
i
would
rather
not
have
not
heavy
rather
light
bodied
and
very
drinkable
a
good
dark
beer
for
the
summer
dgood
easy
to
drink
with
a
lighter
feel
a
prime
example
to
show
that
dark
color
does
not
equate
to
full
bodied
definitely
okay
and
i
love
this
brewer
less
than
3
a
bottle
at
total
wine
more
i
like
the
witbier
the
best
though
d
a
very
nice
beer
the
thinner
viscosity
increases
the
drinkability
and
it
paired
very
nicely
with
a
grilled
appenzeller
and
arugula
sandwich
surprisingly
easy
drinking
surprising
and
exceptional
dark
ale
from
new
belgium
not
necessarily
intruiging
but
a
very
repeatedly
enjoyable
beer
this
is
going
on
my
list
of
favorites
all
around
i
really
like
this
beer
im
a
fan
of
beers
with
wonderful
malt
character
and
this
fits
the
bill
d
this
is
one
to
savour
it
may
be
better
to
share
this
with
a
friend
since
its
so
rich
this
isnt
a
bad
beeri
think
it
pales
in
comparison
to
chambly
noire
and
rare
vos
i
could
drink
a
few
of
thesethey
are
reasonably
priced
pours
a
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
the
head
almost
all
but
vanished
quickly
leaving
just
a
ring
around
the
edge
that
seemed
to
last
it
smells
roasted
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
tastes
a
bit
like
coffee
med
feel
that
drinks
smooth
well
carbonated
d
i
could
see
myself
drinking
these
as
a
pair
back
to
back
just
to
have
something
different
during
a
session
but
dunno
how
well
id
want
to
make
this
a
full
part
of
my
session
beer
but
ill
be
damned
if
im
not
currently
enjoying
this
one
d
easy
drinker
and
nice
to
see
a
bomber
for
under
4
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
goes
away
rapidly
the
glass
i
poured
it
into
was
wet
so
im
not
gonna
blame
the
beer
for
bad
head
retention
smells
like
chocolate
coffee
and
toasted
bread
tastes
kind
of
crunchy
a
lot
of
the
same
flavors
found
in
the
nose
are
there
particularly
the
roasted
malt
characteristics
not
much
hop
presence
to
speak
of
ive
had
this
many
times
before
and
dont
remember
it
being
as
sweet
as
i
think
it
is
in
this
tasting
maybe
im
just
comparing
it
to
the
pacifico
i
just
drank
either
way
i
like
this
one
drinkability
i
like
that
it
has
real
character
but
it
doesnt
taste
particularly
good
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
at
4
bucks
a
bomber
i
foresee
several
bottles
will
find
a
new
home
in
my
fridge
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
new
belgium
ill
be
picking
up
one
or
two
of
these
to
keep
on
hand
especially
at
2
99
for
a
22oz
bomber
overall
my
first
new
belgium
and
i
can
see
what
the
hype
is
about
i
cannot
get
this
in
ohio
but
will
look
for
it
when
i
visit
nc
again
i
poured
the
beer
at
around
45
degrees
the
balance
improved
immensely
as
the
it
warmed
up
510
degrees
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
beer
not
my
favorite
but
not
bad
at
all
this
was
given
to
me
as
a
housewarming
gift
by
a
buddy
of
mine
and
we
cracked
it
open
at
a
party
pours
a
deep
brown
slightly
murky
color
looks
slightly
watery
smell
is
very
spicy
with
a
slight
hint
of
toffee
and
chocolate
taste
reflects
the
nose
spicy
bits
of
chocolate
relatively
effervescent
lower
abv
makes
this
one
pretty
drinkable
decent
brew
from
new
belgium
very
sessionable
im
not
really
wowed
by
it
but
its
still
damn
solid
and
a
pretty
nice
bargain
d
i
am
super
suprised
by
this
beer
even
though
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
it
works
very
nicely
its
light
on
the
palate
and
the
tummy
and
makes
it
so
you
can
keep
pulling
from
that
glass
it
just
plain
works
this
bomber
will
not
be
an
issue
whatsoever
and
i
should
have
picked
up
multiple
bottles
this
is
decent
one
for
keeping
in
the
house
if
you
want
an
easy
drinker
with
some
flavor
but
its
not
going
to
break
the
bank
good
stuff
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
wonderfully
surprising
chocolaty
fruit
cake
flavors
thick
chewy
dessert
like
feel
loved
it
all
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
in
the
winter
season
the
flavors
are
just
so
warm
and
inviting
the
appearance
was
great
as
well
ive
seen
this
beer
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
a
long
time
i
finally
tried
it
and
i
got
to
say
i
was
blown
away
with
how
delicious
it
was
highly
recommended
cheers
good
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
make
this
more
like
a
porter
than
a
belgian
dark
ale
this
is
a
nice
beer
ultrasmooth
and
mellow
chocolate
in
flavor
i
am
impressed
with
this
after
the
second
time
i
drank
it
the
first
was
skunked
and
past
the
date
on
bottle
although
once
it
gets
past
its
drink
by
date
it
become
oxidized
tasting
and
not
very
consumable
so
watch
the
date
luckily
i
got
this
one
before
the
end
date
a
really
enjoyable
drinkable
black
ale
reminds
me
of
a
german
black
lager
or
czech
cellar
beer
overall
quite
good
a
mix
of
characteristics
that
at
times
seem
not
to
fit
together
as
they
should
but
which
come
together
in
the
overall
impression
as
a
nice
complex
yet
drinkable
medley
the
fairly
low
5
6
abv
keeps
it
going
making
it
a
decent
sessionesque
beer
but
one
which
would
probably
become
tiring
after
a
while
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pintglass
a
crisp
dark
brown
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
that
leaves
slight
lacing
aroma
is
a
slight
amount
of
fruit
and
yeast
the
taste
is
a
complex
blend
of
fruits
dark
malts
and
slight
yeast
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
especially
for
a
dark
ale
this
one
was
quite
enjoyable
the
bomber
pours
brilliantly
clear
very
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights
the
head
is
pronounced
offwhite
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
moderatehigh
chocolate
malt
as
well
as
a
bit
of
roast
and
some
sweetness
the
flavor
is
highly
chocolate
malt
and
slightly
bittersweet
the
finish
is
on
the
dry
side
with
a
nice
lingering
malt
flavor
carbonation
and
body
are
both
moderate
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
quite
drinkable
and
great

it
smells
like
dark

roasted

bittersweet
chocolate
pears

its
a

is
good
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
not
a
bad
choice
as
a
session
beer
either
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
give
me
a
1554
instead
of
a
fat
tire
any
day
so
far
this
is
pretty
good
unfortunately
even
switching
glasses
didnt
help
the
weak
aroma
d
well
balanced
sessionable
full
of
pleasant
flavor
this
deserves
the
mainstream
recognotion
that
fat
tire
has
gotten
a
much
better
beer
and
very
nice
a
great
choice
for
an
everyday
brew
pours
to
the
thin
offwhite
head
and
no
lacing
might
be
the
glass
color
is
dark
redbrown

complex
mixture
of
sweet

chocolate
banana
pear
and
plum

with
a
rich
chocolatey

sweetness
that
gives
way
to
an
almondlike
nuttiness
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
ok
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
unique
dark
ale
from
a
unique
us
brewer
good
stuff
d
easily
easily
my
favorite
yearround
offering
from
new
belgium
when
its
on
tap
i
just
cant
say
no
great
new
belgium
brew
and
glad
to
have
it
in
georgia
nice
taste
complex
lots
of
flavors
but
enjoyable
to
drink
this
bomber
is
a
nice
size
and
great
deal
at
2
99
d
enjoyable
beer
especially
for
a
bomber
costing
4
nice
profile
of
flavors
that
present
themselves
without
assaulting
your
tastebuds
was
able
to
lounge
around
while
slowly
enjoying
this
beer
dhad
marked
this
higher
since
its
an
enjoyable
brew
but
halfway
through
the
bottle
it
started
to
lose
its
appeal
a
bit
the
sweetness
grew
more
pronounced
between
sips
and
id
stop
short
of
calling
it
cloying
but
it
starts
to
unbalance
an
otherwise
awesome
drinking
experience
still
this
is
a
complex
brew
worth
trying
although
it
is
a
tad
overpriced
d
a
nice
session
beer
but
is
filling
this
22
was
enough
for
me
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
good
carbonation
overall
is
it
good
yep
would
i
drink
it
again
yep
do
i
in
my
uneducated
opinion
think
of
it
as
a
belgian
dark
ale
nope
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
little
head
smells
and
tastes
cleanly
of
malts
on
the
brewery
website
they
claim
that
this
is
their
take
on
beer
from
1554
this
has
a
very
smokey
malty
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
a
stout
or
almost
an
ris
but
with
much
less
gravity
no
hop
taste
at
all
but
considering
that
its
not
overly
sweet
id
have
to
say
that
i
enjoy
it
although
it
is
a
bit
pricey
for
a
beer
that
is
neither
especially
good
or
alcoholic
im
glad
that
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
it
holds
a
candle
to
fat
tire
or
mothership
wit
d
very
drinkable
good
dark
session
beer
for
any
occasion
drinkable
maybe
not
my
favorite
style
could
do
without
alot
of
the
bread
d
pretty
damn
drinkable
low
alcohol
and
sessionable
the
foam
was
wheat
in
color
very
thick
foamed
alot
kept
growin
and
very
lacey
the
color
a
very
opaque
with
ambercherry
red
highlights
the
smell
had
a
wheathops
overtone
with
dull
fruity
undertones
the
taste
was
deep
rich
dull
wheatovertone
with
hints
of
fruit
and
a
carmel
highlight
and
also
a
bit
of
coffee
flavour
mouthfeel
med
to
fullbodied
and
somewhat
smooth
drinkability
its
alright
but
the
bitter
tones
seems
to
dominate
which
isnt
a
personal
favorite
very
easy
to
drink
beer
nose
was
less
than
inspiring
but
the
flavor
backed
it
up
hard
to
keep
this
one
away
from
my
mouth
for
long
d
this
is
the
first
time
i
tried
this
style
i
though
overall
the
beer
was
good
slightly
stronger
smell
than
the
taste
actually
was
i
would
definately
try
this
style
again
d
an
after
dinner
cordial
not
something
i
would
have
a
few
of
but
very
good
ive
yet
to
have
a
new
belgium
offering
that
wasnt
a
good
beer
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
brown
head
it
had
a
distinct
caramel
aroma
which
made
me
think
it
was
going
to
be
overly
sweet
it
was
not
it
did
have
a
sweetness
but
was
balanced
out
by
the
hops
i
got
a
strong
alcohol
aftertaste
as
well
it
poured
very
dark
with
a
cream
colored
head
when
held
to
the
light
you
could
see
some
ruby
red
the
smell
was
faint
with
hints
of
caramel
the
taste
was
crisp
and
not
too
sweet
i
could
taste
the
chocolate
as
the
beer
warmed
it
has
an
average
abv
so
that
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
me
if
your
looking
to
try
n
b
for
the
first
time
start
here
its
a
solid
beer
i
thought
this
brew
was
quite
good
i
didnt
expect
much
after
the
weak
aroma
so
the
taste
kind
of
blew
me
away
at
first
very
nice
session
beer
and
i
await
the
arrival
of
new
belgium
in
indiana
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
if
youre
up
for
a
new
type
of
ale
to
drink
but
its
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
buy
it
if
youre
curious
but
thats
only
for
the
hardcore
beer
connoisseur
overall
drinkable
in
a
decent
schwarzbeir
kind
of
way
but
doesnt
present
the
flavor
or
intensity
of
a
great
belgian
dark
ale
had
this
on
tap
at
the
houston
flying
sucer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
half
inch
thick
creamy
head
aroma
is
full
of
oats
and
chocolate
nice
malty
flavor
with
choclate
caramel
and
very
light
coffee
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
another
good
beer
from
a
good
brewery
will
try
again
wonderfully
drinkable
new
belgium
please
hurry
up
and
come
to
florida
d
due
to
its
light
bodied
structure
this
ale
is
very
drinkable
and
in
no
way
undesirable
overall
id
say
this
is
my
favorite
choice
from
the
entire
brewery
and
thats
saying
a
lot
too
thick
and
sweet
to
be
especially
sessionable
but
it
is
certainly
enjoyable
to
drink
notes
a
really
drinkable
dark
ale
reminds
me
of
the
better
schwarzbiers
lighter
in
body
but
huge
on
taste
incredible
for
the
price
i
am
a
fan
of
fat
tire
so
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
it
didnt
let
me
down
quite
drinkable
i
like
this
beer
fat
tire
being
the
most
popular
new
belgium
brew
does
nothing
for
me
so
i
came
to
this
beer
with
low
expectations
an
aggressive
pour
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
resulted
in
a
quickly
disappearing
one
finger
head
the
color
is
a
gorgeous
burnt
molasses
dark
brown
the
smell
was
a
very
pleasant
malty
chocolate
with
a
little
coffee
in
the
mix
the
taste
was
pleasant
and
very
in
line
with
the
aroma
sweet
malt
with
some
chocolate
but
was
a
little
more
subtle
than
i
hoped
for
still
very
good
though
very
very
drinkable
and
a
great
session
candidate
t
m
d
lots
of
mild
chocolate
flavours
i
seemed
to
pick
up
on
a
little
touch
of
smokiness
in
the
beginning
but
that
appears
to
have
gone
away
so
it
may
have
been
in
my
head
some
light
almost
fruity
flavours
adding
a
little
tang
the
body
is
a
little
lighter
and
does
well
with
the
taste
its
very
flavourful
but
nothing
is
explosive
nor
is
the
body
extreme
or
lacking
its
simply
a
nice
delicately
balanced
brew
this
could
even
be
a
fantastic
session
candidate
it
drinks
incredibly
smoothly
and
in
my
case
quickly
its
beer
looks
nice
dark
rubybrown
not
as
dark
as
my
english
barleywine
but
duh
smells
earthy
and
chocolate
malts
drinks
earthy
and
chocolate
malts
maybe
a
little
coffee
its
a
pretty
good
beer
great
body
for
the
small
alcohol
youd
never
guess
it
was
so
low
in
abv
nicely
balanced
a
good
beer
all
in
all
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
the
dark
belgium
lovers
cheers
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
reddish
fringes
small
head
that
disappeared
to
a
thin
line
there
was
lots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
aromas
of
sweet
coffee
malts
smells
a
little
fruity
and
tangy
sweet
coffee
chocolate
and
black
licorice
flavors
there
is
also
a
fruity
or
hoppy
background
behind
the
strong
coffee
flavors
a
bitterness
shows
up
in
the
middle
and
end
there
is
also
a
nice
chocolate
coffee
flavor
that
lingers
in
the
dry
finish
good
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
good
taste
the
taste
is
also
mostly
a
sweet
full
earthiness
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
toastiness
that
fades
to
leave
a
pleasant
mild
earthy
aftertaste
the
palate
is
thick
and
full
although
this
isnt
the
type
of
beer
i
would
typically
go
for
the
low
abv
makes
it
a
belgian
style
that
you
can
enjoy
in
larger
amounts
overall
as
you
may
have
gathered
im
a
fan
for
a
while
this
was
my
favourite
beer
it
has
since
been
usurped
but
it
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
and
it
is
one
that
i
try
to
use
to
introduce
my
friends
to
tasty
brews
as
opposed
to
tolerable
swig
please
try
it
d
pretty
decent
ive
heard
a
lot
of
ppl
say
they
like
this
over
fat
tire
but
i
would
disagree
fat
tire
i
think
tops
this
one
granted
i
havent
had
too
many
belgian
darks
but
i
think
this
is
a
little
quiet
for
a
belgian
i
wasnt
particularly
impressed
with
this
one
not
right
off
the
bat
anyway
it
poured
up
a
crystal
clear
dark
red
colour
with
a
huge
2
and
a
half
three
finger
foamy
cap
that
stayed
in
place
for
several
minutes
smell
honestly
reminded
me
of
bmc
perhaps
a
notch
or
two
above
but
imo
i
couldnt
really
detect
anything
of
much
quality
present
in
the
smell
flavour
luckily
was
a
bit
better
there
was
a
lovely
woodiness
present
here
which
to
me
tasted
like
freshly
sawn
damp
timber
smells
along
with
some
modest
malt
flavours
mouthfeel
was
okay
i
suppose
in
regards
to
weight
and
carbonation
again
nothing
really
impressive
overall
not
a
terrible
concoction
and
certainly
several
notches
above
fat
tire
as
always
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
a
go
at
this
one
drinkability
goes
down
easily
and
would
work
well
session
beer
but
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
for
that
overall
its
fun
to
drink
very
inviting
especially
for
chocalate
lovers
funny
i
cant
taste
the
alcohol
the
drink
has
a
firm
medium
body
and
a
spritz
of
carbonic
liveliness
that
pushes
1554
into
an
echelon
of
nearhighest
drinkability
the
best
brew
ive
enjoyed
from
new
belgium
to
date
d
mild
flavors
and
decent
mouthfeel
make
this
an
easy
drinker
d
a
good
beer
to
be
enjoyed
by
itself
very
complex
might
pair
well
with
well
cooked
meats
this
is
a
solid
beer
from
new
belgium
served
in
a
nice
rounded
new
belgium
tulip
glass
its
on
the
dark
end
of
the
spectrum
with
a
nice
inviting
head
i
had
this
beer
at
a
number
of
different
places
on
a
trip
to
colorado
and
sometimes
it
came
in
a
pint
and
looked
pretty
much
like
an
american
porter
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
the
word
nice
its
just
a
nice
beer
its
got
a
nice
soft
feel
to
it
a
nice
creamyness
and
a
nice
but
not
too
sweet
dry
chocolateyness
to
it
not
like
a
chocolate
added
type
of
beer
but
a
nice
strong
sense
of
chocolate
coming
through
in
the
malt
backdrop
real
smooth
and
pleasant
and
again
just
nice
to
drink
overall
an
above
average
beer
but
nothing
makes
me
want
to
buy
again
after
looking
forward
to
having
this
brand
in
the
area
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
not
to
mention
their
distribution
decision
dark
coppery
brown
with
a
creamy
sticky
head
the
aroma
is
initially
roasted
dark
malts
caramelized
sugars
and
coffee
beans
deeper
down
is
a
softer
fruitier
more
floral
aspect
that
takes
the
edge
off
of
the
drier
charred
malts
the
flavor
like
the
smell
is
a
balance
of
chocolate
and
lightly
burned
malts
with
mellow
sweet
fruits
like
berries
and
cherries
there
a
definite
belgian
yeast
character
but
not
so
much
that
it
takes
control
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
drying
finish
lingering
cherry
candy
pretty
tasty
and
interesting
had
an
extra
bottle
left
over
from
a
trade
i
sent
off
so
i
figured
i
would
try
it
out
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
little
head
fades
fast
almost
no
lacing
smells
of
chocolate
toffee
little
coffee
and
some
fruits
but
i
cant
make
out
what
exactly
has
a
burntroasted
taste
to
it
almost
like
guinness
thin
watery
mouth
feel
was
a
little
disappointing
but
it
was
easy
to
drink
drinkability
good
beer
but
a
little
too
bitter
without
much
support
to
drink
this
too
quickly
or
to
have
more
than
a
glass
or
two
maybe
its
just
not
my
style
of
beer
i
smelled
entirely
different
things
than
i
tasted
which
was
slightly
offputting
and
confusing
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
but
wouldnt
refuse
it
if
offered
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
plan
on
drinking
it
again
i
hope
to
be
able
to
enjoy
some
other
belgian
style
beers
from
new
belgium
in
the
future
22
oz
one
of
the
more
interesting
pours
ive
seen
in
a
while
near
black
brown
pour
with
the
head
near
straight
white
the
contrast
unusual
and
interesting
looking
little
white
bubbly
lacing
malty
aroma
roast
nut
tastes
simple
of
roast
malt
and
cocoa
just
the
tiniest
start
of
sourness
but
it
is
gone
so
quickly
it
might
just
be
me
could
be
some
slight
dark
fruits
a
little
tobacco
in
the
finish
is
a
little
odd
but
not
offputting
found
this
extreamly
drinkable
after
a
nice
bike
ride
reminded
me
of
a
schwarzbier
of
the
2
ive
had
from
new
belgium
this
one
fat
tire
i
definetely
prefer
this
would
seek
it
out
for
regular
consumption
1554
enlightened
black
ale

in
color
with
okay
head

it

chocolately
aromas
with

floral
undertones
to
it
the
1554
carried
a
malty
taste
with
hints
of
chocolate
it
had
a
kind
of
thick
mouthfeel
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
all
in
all
a
nice
beer
if
you
want
an
easydrinking
not
very
complex
belgian
drinks
easy
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
than
most
black
ales
or
porters
has
flavor
and
complexity
to
carry
it
through
great
session

i
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
for
sure
easy
to
drink
beer
with
chocolatey

sour

would
d
a

the

note
was
somewhat
overwhelming
for
me
at
times
a
decent
offering
from

oatmeal

a
shade

is
just
shy
of
being
black

being

dark
to
be

brown
nothing
noticeable
in
the
aroma
slight
roasted
flavors
in
taste
but
nothing
that
stands
out
the
body
is
light
for
an
ale
but
would
be
fulfilling
if
considered
a
lager
d
a
good
solid
drinkable
and
sessionable
beer
not
the
greatest
thing
out
there
but
it
is
unique
and
well
worth
a
try
every
now

much
carbonation
in
my
opinion
malt
and
coffee
flavors
were
predominant
with
the
coffee
flavors
lingering
a
tasty
if
tough
to
categorize
black
beer
from
new
belgium
pretty
drinkable
beer
better
than
i
had
expected
this
beer
was
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
a
beer
that
was
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
about
an
inch
head
to
it
with
sticky
lacing
throughout
nose
was
of
smokiness
caramel
roasted
and
sweet
malts
taste
is
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
and
bitterness
the
carbonation
is
actually
extremely
visible
i
was
also
surprised
by
the
light
body
on
this
beer
overall
quite
pleasant
and
the
lighter
body
to
it
makes
it
a
beer
that
i
could
sit
with
for
a
session
and
not
feel
full
d
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
ill
just
write
a
short
paragraph
about
this
one
not
good
i
actually
went
into
this
beer
thinking
you
know
what
this
might
be
the
first
new
belgium
beer
i
actually
like
boy
was
i
wrong
its
seethrough
dark
brown
body
and
tan
head
were
the
most
impressive
though
still
not
very
impressive
aspects
of
this
one
it
smells
sweet
as
hell
with
noticable
malts
the
taste
is
sweet
fruit
and
black
licorice
and
everso
bland
all
i
have
to
say
about
drinkability
is
that
i
knew
i
had
made
a
mistake
with
the
first
sip
and
i
wanted
so
badly
to
pour
it
out
mouthfeel
makes
me
think
of
blend
of
a
dark
belgian
ale
with
a
schwarzbier
pleasant
and
highly
drinkable
with
a
reasonable
abv
i
really
like
this
one
its
one
of
the
first
beers
i
branched
out
into
after
i
discovered
that
fat
tire
wasnt
the
only
drinkable
beer
out
there
i
was
really
pleasantly
surprised
and
drank
this
one
quite
a
lot
for
a
while
a
nice
dark
color
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
smell
and
taste
i
could
actually
drink
this
one
all
evening
very
happily
and
when
im
at
the
grocery
store
if
theres
nothing
new
to
try
this
one
is
often
the
one
ill
fall
back
onto
mouth
is
crisp
but
rich
in
quality
light
carbonation
and
drinks
fairly
easy
a
black
ale
to
cherish
for
sure
but
i
would
have
to
be
in
just
the
right
mood
again
to
really
enjoy
this
one
d
being
that
its
a
thinner
beer
its
very
drinkable
and
doesnt
get
old
very
easy
to
drink
a
bomber
thanks
to
artisanbrew
for
the
hookup
wherever
you
are
a
good
beer
that
needs
to
be
drank
with
a
clean
palate
in
order
to
detect
much
of
the
subtle
flavors
a
good
starter
beer
and
most
certainly
qualifies
as
sessionable
small
head
that
disappears
quickly
deep
brown
and
red
hues
not
incredibly
dark
which
was
slightly
disappointing
with
limited
lace
down
sides
of
glass
smells
of
sweet
malts
particularly
chocolate
tastes
of
coffee
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
hops
apparent
in
moments
enough
to
call
this
beer
wellbalanced
light
mouthfeel
with
enough
carbonation
and
memorable
malts
makes
this
ale
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
though
im
a
little
disappointed
that
it
lacks
a
bigger
flavor
and
body
considering
the
name
and
classification
this
wouldnt
stop
me
from
having
another
or
recommending
it
to
folks
id
just
change
some
things
on
the
label
d
two
or
three
of
these
would
be
pretty
good
right
now
very
drinkable
over
all
good
beer
a
little
over
carbonated
but
not
too
much
similar
to
new
belgiums
abbey
beer
but
more
smoky
and
not
as
great
in
my
opinion
the
aroma
is
odd
with
both
roasted
malt
and
hops
but
also
a
yeast
smell
that
is
unique
as
well
as
some
chocolate
and
earthiness
the
appearance
is
brown
with
an
average
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
but
a
tad
thin
overall
i
like
it
but
its
not
a
favorite
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
sort
of
hard
to
come
by
in
iowa
but
when
i
find
it
i
buy
it
it
does
not
stand
out
as
a
favorite
but
definitely
a
good
staple
d
i
think
this
beer
has
solid
darker
malt
flavors
with
a
lot
of
wheatiness
if
anything
is
weak
it
is
the
mouthfeel
but
still
a
really
good
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
growing
up
45
minutes
away
from
the
brewery
it
is
one
of
my
home
grown
favorites
trust
me
you
havent
had
it
until
you
have
had
it
from
the
brewery
drinkability
is
very
nice
on
this
beer
the
syrupy
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
lends
this
beer
to
be
drank
very
quickly
it
has
good
taste
and
goes
down
so
nicely
i
wish
this
beer
had
better
taste
but
its
a
good
solid
beer
to
take
down
a
sixpack
of
overall
a
decent
beer
not
a
big
fan
of
this
type
but
this
beer
is
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
verdict
another
complex
and
interesting
offering
from
new
belgium
1554
is
a
roastedmalt
delight
with
that
little
belgian
twist
new
belgium
is
so
famous
for
if
you
havent
sampled
1554
yet
put
it
on
your
list
of
beers
to
try
medium
body
and
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
i
was
very
surprised
and
taken
aback
by
this
one
of
my
new
favorites
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
wasnt
really
a
special
experience
i
didnt
get
tired
of
it
before
the
end
of
the
glass
but
i
doubt
i
would
reach
for
another
bottle
given
other
choices
pours
a
lovely
dark
red
almost
black
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
tastes
the
same
heavy
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
chocolate
tinge
very
very
drinkable
nice
and
full
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
note
to
self
ranked
the
4
belgian
dark
ale
when
i
tried
it
deep
black
with
amber
highlights
and
a
foamy
tan
head
the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
was
about
a
year
ago
and
i
hated
it
now
it
smells
malty
and
sweet
and
complex
it
tastes
just
as
good
it
is
a
little
bubbly
for
me
but
its
a
belgian
so
that
is
to
be
expected
i
love
this
beer
its
my
favorite
from
new
belgium
drinkability
after
a
light
dinner
in
lieu
of
dessert
i
wouldcould
enjoy
a
1554
when
the
temperatures
dip
into
the
negatives
pull
out
a
couple
1554s
to
provide
warmth
d
it
is
very
smooth
with
little
carbonation
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
without
missing
out
on
the
full
bodied
flavorness
of
a
great
beer
pours
a
deep
redbrown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
for
two
good
drafts
leaving
a
nice
lacing
fruity
sweet
scent
with
a
chocolatey
roasted
malt
taste
finishing
slighty
sweet
and
nutty
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
brew
a
dark
ale
i
would
definitely
recommend
to
fans
of
this
style
overall
a
very
good
beer
with
a
good
balance
and
character
enjoyed
my
head
and
stomach
told
me
something
else
the
next
day
drink
this
as
an
after
dinner
treat
i
think
that
this
is
new
belgiums
best
tap
fox
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
a
thick
brown
head
aroma
is
bitter
coffee
bakers
chocolate
and
smoke
taste
is
questionable
some
pulls
were
good
others
seemed
sour
i
think
the
yeast
is
to
blame
it
seemed
to
be
fighting
the
hops
and
malt
for
dominance
needs
more
balance
poured
into
a
pint
glass
giving
off
a
beautiful
cream
colored
head
that
left
a
nice
lacey
lining
on
the
glass
walls
showed
a
very
dark
ruby
black
color
similar
to
that
of
coca
cola
dark
chocolate
malts
with
a
roasted
smelling
nose
very
roasty
actually
dark
bitter
baking
chocolate
with
very
faint
hints
of
toffee
almost
get
a
burntdark
roast
coffee
the
taste
was
what
expected
from
the
smell
with
dark
roasty
coffee
overtones
that
lingered
in
my
mouth
roasted
malted
sweetness
prevails
over
the
hoppy
bitterness
im
not
a
big
hophead
so
this
aspect
was
pleasing
mouthful
entailed
a
medium
to
full
body
with
a
smooth
velvety
feel
as
i
consumed
this
dark
beverage
one
would
be
enough
for
now
but
i
would
definitely
consider
buying
this
again
it
very
much
reminds
me
of
this
underhouse
smoked
porter
i
had
back
in
college
d
unique
brew
overall
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
had
a
black
ale
as
they
call
it
good
well
rounded
beermagpie14dec

guava
and
peanuts
so
yeah
thats
what
that
fruitiness
is
like
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
creaminess
displayed
here
is
the
saving
grace
for
the
beer
a
very
drinkable
beer
rich
cocoa
this
tastes
like
a
poor
stout
with
hints
of
toasted
grains
caramel
like
flavors
dominate
some
chocolate
pudding
but
for
one
or
two
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
contained
a
slight
burnt
malt
essence
leading
into
a
sweet
roasted
malt
on
the
palate
or
want
a
dark
ale
you
can
drink
a
few
of
this
is
a
good
starting
point
if
you
like
this
alans
son
the
first
smell
is
roasted
oat
with
sweetness
the
roasted
malt
is
the
dominant
taste
but
still
imposing
id
try
it
again

were

were
nearly
identical
to
a
good

if
it
was
truly
a
1554
vintage
brussels
back
ale
where
was
the

sediment
the
flavor
imparted
by
a
little
yeast
would
have
added
a
bit
of
complexity
that
was
lacking
for
a
beer
of
reputed
belgian
origin
i
doubt
they
had
filtration
back
then
and
the
beer
would
have
been
cask
conditioned
the

was
good

when
the

died
down
it
very
nearly
smelled
like
a

like
with

the
very

thing
that
came

i
first
tried
it
on

a

from

these
combine
with
its

this
is

it
leaves

back
everyone
else
up
here
by
saying
this
is
a
solid
dark
beer
that
is
hard
to
classify
like
a
light
porter
with
a
slightly
present
yeast
bite
that
i
wish
wasnt
so
restrained
a
big
version
of
this
would
make
it
exceptional
pbrianapr
22
but
any
resemblance
ends
there
toasty
munich
malt
is
discernible
in
the
aroma
ive
only
drunk
a
few
dark
belgians
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
belgian
beers
outside
of
russian
river
and
great
divide
just
enough
raisin
overall
it
is
the
rare
belgian
dark
aledubbelamber
that
grabs
me
and
alas
this
beer
is
not
among
them
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
for
the
style
but
not
really
to
my
taste
really
a
lovely
dark
belgian
ale
o
good
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
d
at
this
abv
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
so
smooth
and
good
i
could
start
and
finish
my
night
with
something
like
thanks
black
raven
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
bourbon
lpm
overall
a
solid
beer
and
i
would
get
this
again
but
i
would
try
a
different
style
of
glass
just
to
check
it
out
the
body
is
solid
and
full
without
being
heavy
the
only
reason
drinkability
suffers
is
due
to
the
strength
making
it
tricky
to
have
more
than
a
couple
i
think
this
beer
will
develop
a
nice
smoothness
with
a
little
time
worth
seeking
out
easy
drinkable
with
hints
of
chocolate
very
far
away
in
the
taste
a
totally
different
beer
on
tap
o
this
is
a
solid
belgian
dark
ale
that
could
be
more
than
it
is
if
it
were
better
balanced
this
beer
would
be
a
winner
the
sour
cherry
flavour
is
really
the
hero
here
balancing
the
palate
as
well
as
giving
good
texture
to
the
flavour
profile
good
beer
good
for
drinking
during
the
colder
months
o
disiponting
beer
from
the
koninck
little
taste
its
to
sweet
and
the
spices
dont
come
out
in
the
beer
the
longer
it
stays
in
your
glass
more
tastes
a
gone
d
not
a
bad
belgian
dark
but
not

either

i
guess
now
de
koninck
always
makes
very
drinkable
ales
out
of
antwerp
and
this
one
is
no
different
glad
i
got
to
try
another
one
since
the
only
beer
ive
ever
seen
from
this
brewery
is
the
common
pale
despite
the
unusual
flavors
that
come
through
it
is
very
drinkable
and
light
in
the
mouth
the
mouth
was
a
little
winey
with
a
whiskey
like
feel
but
without
the
heavy
alcohol
sting
its
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
not
that
heavy
on
the
spice
for
a
winter
brew
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
and
the
aroma
is
definitely
sweet
like
one
would
expect
from
a
candy
factory
the
initial
taste
has
flavors
of
fruits
such
as
cherries
pears
and
maybe
even
some
raisins
finishes
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
spices
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
thin
so
one
tends
to
drink
it
a
bit
faster
than
most
belgians
but
overall
has
favorable
drinkability
d
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
but
the
fusel
alcohols
are
a
bug
turnoff
and
make
me
fear
an
oncoming
hangover
d
nothing
offensive
here
but
nothing
great
either
pretty
bland
and
weak
i
doubt
ill
ever
give
this
one
another
chance
for
now
ill
stick
to
the
blond
koninck
but
not
much
malt
to
back
it
up
i
suppose
the
relatively
low
abv
is
the
problem
as
a
belgian
dark
should
have
more
complexity

like

tastes
like

feels
like

will
not
buy
again
especially
for
18
for
a
6
pack
surprised
to
see
this
rated
so
low
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
can
of
beer
i
think
ive
seen
this
artwork
on
their
beer
before
but
i
am
all
for
recycling
i
like
this
one
although
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
that
i
found
belgian
about
it
even
though
it
is
listed
as
such
for
me
this
was
a
well
hopped
and
well
carbonated
drinkable
dark
ale
that
showcases
the
best
of
both
a
distinct
hop
structure
and
fun
dark
grain
that
doesnt
bring
much
bitterness
to
the
mix
but
gleefully
provides
a
roasty
base
the
yeast
was
almost
nondescript
for
me
really
unadventurous
and
certainly
lacking
the
belgian
qualities
but
i
dont
wish
for
more
yeast
taste
here
i
like
the
way
the
grain
is
predominant
not
chocolate
or
burnt
barley
but
somewhere
in
that
happy
dark
medium
the
beer
is
also
remarkably
low
on
the
tannin
front
which
for
me
here
allows
for
a
mire
drinkable
dark
brew
less
harsh
and
textured
than
others
its
actually
quite
light
in
feel
with
fine
carbonation
even
though
the
head
doesnt
last
long
when
i
first
got
introduced
to
these
guys
i
loved
everything
the
made
since
then
i
have
been
let
down
but
several
but
its
nice
to
see
them
continue
to
push
in
new
directions
i
think
this
one
is
a
success
and
maybe
judged
a
little
harshly
on
here
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
bold
with
lots
of
toasted
and
roasted
malts
and
grains
the
taste
is
heavier
than
most
porters
with
lots
of
dark
fruits
and
grains
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
toasted
caramel
flavor
overall
its
quite
good
and
interesting
very
appealing
to
those
dark
beer
lovers
i
wont
get
this
again
off
flavor
and
smell
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
the
whole
is
less
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
it
has
a
nice
full
flavor
but
some
of
the
funkyyeasty
taste
is
a
little
uninvited
its
decent
but
probably
a
onetime
affair
darker
tasting
where
the
chocolate
is
closer
to
bitter
dark
the
body
is
notably
thin
and
the
carbonation
elevated
good
bitter
hop
pop
in
the
swallow
leaving
an
aftertaste
of
unsweetened
cocoa

o

lists
this

thought
it
was

of
a
black
ipa
ok
drinkabilitybut
nothing
that
stands
out
another
reviewer
astutely
called
it
like
a
combination
between
a
porter
and
a
saison
i
think
that
is
spot
on
but
that
just
doesnt
work
for
me
body
feels
a
bit
watery
honestly
this
was
a
bit
of
and
a
dissapointment
recommended
to
me
as
a
schwarzbier
but
its
hardly
that
not
really
a
belgian
dark
ale
either
guess
it
pays
to
check
ba
sometimes
before
buying
serving
type
can
rjt
i
cracked
the
can
open
and
a
snake
began
slithering
out
of
the
opening
with
its
fangs
bared
hungrily
no
instead
i
got
a
spray
of
beer
from
a
superfull
can
i
grabbed
the
snake
i
mean
can
by
its
tail
aand
began
an
inverted
glug
until
the
head
formation
became
too
much
to
allow
me
to
cantinue
and
i
set
it
back
down
the
pseudocascade
was
quite
evident
in
this
one
and
as
it
settled
it
formed
three
dense
fingers
of
deeptanlightbrown
head
with
excellent
retention
while
i
waited
for
things
to
settle
i
looked
about
for
the
snake
which
had
seized
the
opportunity
to
slither
off
color
was
very
dark
brown
to
black
but
not
opaque

its
light
dry

and
refreshing
in

that
isnt

it
doesnt
bite

hard

runs
very
clean
and
smooth
with
a
little
of
a

very
dark
almost
black
but
the

is
medium

got
a

together
with
the
color
makes
it
a

a

thinking
mainly

and
a

also

found
in

no

except
that
its
very
subtly
fruity
with
a

berry
the
bitterness
is
moderate
and
theres
just
a
light
touch
of
dark
malt
acidity
some
lightly
floral
grassy
and
leafy
hops
come
through
mainly
at
the

and
into
the
gently
lingering

its
nice
that
the
roastiness
is
kept
in
check
leaving
it

cheers
o
an
interesting
brew
kind
of
like
a
combination
between
a
porter
and
a
saison
definitely
different
than
anything
else
i
have
come
across
in
the
past
i
enjoyed
this
hybrid
but
can
easily
see
how
others
might
find
some
dissonance
in
the
combination
of
flavorsaromas
i
enjoyed
the
complexity
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
a
tough
drink
but
not
a
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
during
a
session
easy
enough
to
drink
but
doesnt
really
wow
me
sort
of
a
training
wheels
black
saison
or
is
it
a
porter
overall
im
not
sure
what
style
this
beer
is
really
supposed
to
be
but
its
tasty
and
drinkable
enough
id
have
it
again
it
has
a
black
color
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leave
no
real
lacing
the
smell
is
chocolate
malt
and
a
bit
metallic
overall
a
pretty
interesting
and
solid
tasting
brew
more
like
a
porter
than
saison
but
the
belgian
element
is
noticeable
with
a
nice
banana
flavor
certainly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
but
perhaps
a
tad
mundane
for
a
stillwater
offering
overallhad
no
idea
this
was
a
saison
cause
it
does
not
drink
like
one
tastes
like
a
slightly
below
average
roasty
black
ale
a
lighter
porter
not
bad
but
similar
to
other
beers
i
have
had
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
overall
this
is
certainly
a
decent
beer
just
maybe
a
bit
thin
super
even
could
use
some
more
excitement
somewhere
very
easy
to
drink
sessionable
but
i
think
i
might
get
bored
after
a
few
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
capped
with
a
solid
head
of
tan
froth
clean
nutty
malt
aroma
along
with
some
fruity
yeast
mild
and
simple
fruity
yeast
and
nutty
malts
continue
into
the
flavor
adding
some
very
light
chocolaty
roast
and
a
bit
of
spice
into
the
mix
citrus
and
malted
milk
balls
creamy
and
quite
dry
which
helps
with
the
drinkability
this
is
not
a
saison
and
i
dont
see
it
marketed
as
such
anywhere
so
im
rating
this
as
an
easygoing
black
ale
with
a
slight
belgian
twist
i
dont
know
im
usually
impressed
with
stillwater
but
this
comes
across
as
merely
okay
o
this
seems
like
more
of
an
experiment
than
anything
else
stillwater
has
done
better
work
drinkable
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
my
first
from
stillwater
and
i
enjoyed
it
2
49
for
a
single
though
thats
a
bit
much
but
this
is
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
dark
saison
pretty
tasty
o
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
can
is
my
favorite
part
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
from
stillwater
worth
trying
but
i
am
going
to
stick
with
classique
as
my
go
to
low
alcohol
canned
option
from
stillwater
overall
this
seems
like
the
new
idea
first
was
black
ipa
then
white
ipa
now
black
saison
not
really
a
great
idea
just
seems
like
it
should
be
but
isnt
the
different
characters
dont
match
up
its
all
over
the
place
and
for
that
not
too
enjoyable
and
distracting
carbonation
on
top
of
it
all
malt
profile
here
is
very
nice
between
the
chocolate
and
toasted
nutty
flavors
the
yeast
might
dry
the
beer
out
just
a
bit
much
for
me
and
a
slight
tartness
doesnt
mix
in
amazingly
with
the
grain
profile
solid
but
black
farmhouse
ales
seem
like
a
very
difficult
style
to
pull
off
poured
into
a
hebrew
small
shaker
pint
pours
nearly
black
opaque
in
the
glass
with
a
half
finger
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
toasted
malt
with
light
chocolate
and
saison
yeast
light
spiciness
flavor
is
light
toasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
char
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
initially
mellow
and
well
integrated
light
hops
and
char
come
out
more
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
a
nice
light
black
ale
the
saison
style
yesst
gives
this
a
little
more
spiciness
and
fruitiness
than
a
classic
black
ale
the
saison
influence
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
dark
malts
nicely
balanced
and
toasty
for
a
session
ale
opretty
solid
brew
drinks
very
similar
to
a
porter
definitely
worth
trying
pours
black
indeed
with
a
1
inch
greyish
khaki
head
that
quickly
dissipates
looking
closely
it
looks
like
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
this
one
aromas
of
slight
roasted
malts
and
some
kind
of
yeasty
breadiness
also
faint
hints
of
coffee
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
the
weak
point
in
the
beer
sadly
there
isnt
much
that
pop
out
in
this
beer
its
definitely
more
of
a
easy
to
drink
sessionable
dark
ale
than
a
porter
or
a
black
i
p
a
pretty
similar
to
a
black
lager
very
light
bodied
mouth
feel
i
wish
there
was
more
flavor
to
this
one
trying
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
to
see
if
that
helps
like
it
normally
does
nope
not
really
o
grab
a
can
of
this
if
you
see
it
very
unique
labeled
as
a
smooth
black
ale
less
fruity
than
id
thought
itd
be
pleasing
better
than
id
expected
dont
expect
a
smooth
and
round
stout
because
of
the
noire
thats
a
nice
strong
dark
ale
very
drinkable
and
accessible
it
looks
like
a
light
version
of
the
trois
pistoles
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
yes
definitely
it
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
and
you
wanna
drink
a
unibroue
beer
go
for
it
but
for
myself
i
prefer
the
leffe
brune
or
even
the
stambroise
oatmeal
scoot
is
muche
better
than
this
beer
but
the
noire
the
chambly
is
much
better
than
those
rickards
dark
etc
thx
for
reading
unibroue
is
arguably
one
of
the
best
brewers
of
belgian
ales
outside
of
belgium
but
noire
de
chambly
unlike
most
of
their
offerings
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
oldworld
ales
its
been
modeled
after
its
not
a
bad
recipe
by
any
means
but
the
monks
and
timehoned
brewers
of
walloonia
and
flanders
make
much
more
graceful
and
complex
ales
than
this
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
fair
beer
and
perhaps
one
that
unibroue
could
improve
it
does
not
match
their
other
offerings
in
flavor
or
texture
i
would
however
recommend
this
as
a
good
intro
beer
to
the
unibroue
family
3
75
d
not
my
favourite
unibroue
offering
but
this
started
to
taste
better
after
the
initial
first
few
sips
the
woody
smoke
flavour
was
interesting
and
different
than
other
smoke
tastes
ive
had
to
date
overall
not
overwhelmed
in
all
by
this
but
it
is
a
tasty
belgian
dark
ale
that
you
can
easily
go
back
for
more
than
two
glasses
worth
so
its
high
in
terms
of
drinkability
because
it
wont
necessarily
cause
you
to
fall
over
when
you
stand
up
final
grade
3
74
a
decent
b
grade
to
be
honest
i
dont
really
remember
if
i
liked
noire
de
chambly
the
first
time
i
tried
it
all
those
years
ago
i
wasnt
truly
converted
over
to
craft
beer
at
that
point
and
while
it
was
a
nice
changeup
from
the
bow
valley
strong
i
just
threw
up
in
my
mouth
a
little
i
wasnt
exactly
clamoring
for
another
bottle
looking
at
it
today
however
i
can
see
that
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
quality
belgianstyle
dark
ale
while
their
strong
dark
ales
maudite
la
terrible
etc
are
undeniably
better
this
is
a
good
substitute
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
belgian
beer
you
can
have
a
few
glasses
of
without
losing
your
equilibrium
worth
a
try
o
i
didnt
love
this
but
im
stoked
that
i
got
a
bottle
of
the
pre
name
change
brew
the
low
abv
sums
up
the
thin
body
and
flavor
i
would
really
like
this
in
a
six
pack
due
to
its
easy
drinkability
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
this
out
in
the
future
but
a
good
brew
to
try
pours
a
clear
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
caramel
and
toffee
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
dark
fruit
and
slight
cardboard
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
definitely
showing
signs
of
oxidation
but
still
is
pretty
decent
as
a
whole
this
is
certainly
decent
beer
but
when
considered
against
the
rest
of
unibroues
lineup
ends
up
being
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
the
spicy
yeasty
notes
are
simply
overpowering
here
causing
the
rest
of
the
beer
to
be
rather
lost
and
the
heavy
carbonation
ends
up
marring
the
mouthfeel
with
foaminess
decent
but
could
have
used
a
bit
more
sugar
and
a
lot
less
co2
o
noire
not
as
roasted
or
toasted
as
id
expect
for
the
name
flavour
wise
still
is
a
decent
belgian
for
those
who
havent
tried
it
yet
just
dont
expect
the
same
complexity
as
unibroues
stronger
offerings
pours
looks
smells
and
tastes
a
bit
cokelike
lots
of
carbonation
thinfeeling
sweet
and
slightly
earthy
this
time
it
looked
and
smelled
a
bit
better
than
i
remembered
the
first
time
i
imagine
this
was
a
slightly
fresher
bottle
the
other
was
bought
at
a
dep
lots
of
unibroue
yeast
character
with
some
spiced
fruit
scents
and
a
toasted
malt
character
to
the
flavor
the
beer
drinks
pretty
easy
but
could
definitely
be
a
little
more
robust
in
almost
every
way
probably
wont
revisit
not
bad
but
not
terribly
engaging
either
hmm
maybe
they
have
some
old
mauditetrois
pistolesla
fin
du
monde
laying
around
o
not
bad
for
an
easy
drink
it
would
be
good
to
have
o
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
although
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
again
not
to
flavor
intensive
but
very
easy
drinking
at
6
2
if
it
was
one
sale
id
get
it
but
other
wise
it
was
passable
the
beer
is
black
not
too
dark
the
head
is
beige
in
color
it
disappear
quickly
quite
effervescent
the
aroma
gives
notes
of
unbroken
yeast
typical
some
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
on
the
taste
side
the
beer
is
typical
unbroken
slightly
spicy
with
a
good
presence
of
roasted
malts
quite
effervescent
in
the
mouth
the
taste
lingers
in
the
mouth
smooth
in
the
mouth
also
strange
because
the
carbonation
is
quite
present
but
it
feels
smooth
im
surprised
in
a
good
way
by
this
beer
a
good
one
for
some
reason
i
remember
this
being
much
much
darker
nearly
black
and
thick
and
scary
i
was
maybe
too
young
to
know
any
better
but
i
remember
this
being
too
much
for
me
as
a
young
craft
beer
drinker
revisited
again
and
it
seemed
so
basic
not
intimidating
at
all
dont
know
what
the
younger
me
was
thinking
the
pour
is
dark
dark
brown
but
letting
some
light
through
inch
or
two
of
tan
head
rests
lazily
on
top
the
nose
is
more
german
than
belgian
to
me
like
a
dark
lager
or
schwarzbier
i
smell
a
similar
malt
bill
with
similar
roasty
properties
and
the
belgian
yeast
is
very
understated
the
yeast
comes
out
more
in
the
taste
where
the
dark
malts
give
way
to
some
sweeter
notes
and
the
spice
surge
of
the
yeast
but
this
still
tastes
to
me
like
a
german
dark
lager
it
finishes
oddly
quick
and
dry
which
to
me
wass
a
knock
against
this
beer
i
like
the
richness
of
the
malt
to
linger
on
awhile
full
bodied
and
brightly
carbonated
the
feel
is
nice
i
could
drink
several
of
these
but
i
must
admit
it
was
somewhat
disappointing
from
what
i
had
remembered
of
this
deep
dark
mysterious
liquid
maybe
the
recipe
has
changed
maybe
my
palate
has
matured
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
by
any
measure
enjoyable
with
friends
or
food
but
lacks
any
wow
factor
it
is
a
good
relaxing
beer
nose
features
a
pleasingly
potent
combo
of
baked
apples
molasses
sweetened
tobacco
and
red
grape
juice
plentiful
malty
and
fruity
sweetness
perhaps
a
tad
much
for
my
liking
but
a
tangy
yeast
presence
goes
a
long
way
toward
balancing
it
out
dryish
finish
the
flavor
profile
really
doesnt
deliver
the
complexity
id
hoped
for
but
its
a
decent
sipper
overall
not
bad
but
pretty
simple

dark

extremely
nice

very
smooth
and
enjoyable
stuff
very
well
done
update
ages
well
based
on
a
best
before
2009
bottle
consumed
in
jan
2013
overall
its
not
too
great
a
little
boring
a
little
watery
and
thin
too
bad
since
i
am
a
big
fan
of
other
unibroue
beers
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
fruity
inclusions
throughout
the
aroma
this
was
not
expected
and
added
a
souring
component
to
the
flavoring
where
we
lost
points
actually
was
in
this
same
vein
as
the
souring
grain
become
overbearing
at
points
taking
away
from
an
otherwise
tasty
beer
o
overall
nothing
special
nothing
awful
overall
this
may
be
the
king
of
dark
ales
for
me
its
as
dark
as
a
stout
but
still
light
enough
for
an
anytime
drink
must
buy
complex
enough
to
keep
me
interested
and
not
slamming
me
over
the
head
with
any
one
flavor
very
well
balanced
very
good
worth
trying
overall
a
bit
light
but
nice
flavor
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
which
is
refreshing
for
a
dark
beer
with
moderate
alcohol
o
i
like
most
of
unibroues
stuff
but
this
one
will
probably
be
a
pass
in
the
future
o
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
that
strikes
the
tongue
with
3
distinct
stages
of
flavor
the
beer
sweetens
as
it
warms
starting
from
55f
to
just
below
room
temperature
buy
one
and
share
it
with
a
friend
or
buy
4
and
share
it
with
7
friends
your
call
the
body
is
thin
and
in
my
opinion
undercarbonated
chambly
noire
is
not
bad
its
just
forgettable
actually
it
could
make
a
great
darker
beer
for
summer
when
you
might
be
in
the
market
for
something
with
a
little
less
substance
overall
a
decent
effort
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
still
good
overall
this
is
a
lighter
dark
belgian
brew
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
great
dark
belgian
im
tired
from
the
day
so
i
feel
this
brew
did
not
receive
the
thorough
review
it
deserved
a
decent
quaff
with
an
interesting
touch
of
spicy
yeast
and
a
hint
of
burnt
raisins
at
ritual
tavern
in
san
diego
o
this
drink
simply
does
not
do
it
for
me
its
decent
for
a
bit
but
consuming
a
whole
750
ml
i
have
grown
tired
of
it
prematurely
i
will
simply
avoid
this
drink
in
the
future
even
a
pint
glass
is
too
much
of
this
for
me
tastes
good
easy
to
drink
unique
profile
definitely
worth
trying
but
it
loses
some
points
for
me
in
having
a
taste
thats
a
tad
bit
watery
wish
the
flavor
was
more
potent
overall
its
pretty
good
but
nothing
special
definitely
unibroues
weakest
offering
i
really
love
their
other
beers
that
said
i
picked
this
up
for
44pack
i
dont
know
of
any
beer
thats
as
good
as
this
for
a
buck
a
bottle
m
still
light
bodied
in
nature
but
doesnt
dip
into
wateriness
levels
of
thinness
carbonation
is
only
somewhat
stronger
than
my
old
bottle
but
that
is
still
an
improvement
86
i
am
a
fan
of
unibroue
i
had
not
tried
this
to
date
on
appearance
it
has
a
opaque
dark
brown
color
it
pours
with
a
23cm
head
little
lacing
evident
smell
of
fruit
with
yeast
taste
is
appropriately
hoppy
with
sweet
overtones
quite
drinkable
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
lacking
overall
this
is
a
good
dark
but
not
up
to
some
of
the
other
unibroue
standard
overall
pretty
light
body
and
taste
in
this
but
as
i
mentioned
kinda
refreshing
and
goes
down
really
easy
that
counts
for
something
in
my
books
o
ok
brew
here
i
expected
more
and
perhaps
it
didnt
live
up
to
that
this
falls
into
the
sure
i
will
take
another
one
but
i
really
dont
care
on
way
or
another
all
things
considered
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
just
disappointing
considering
unibroues
other
excellent
offerings
i
could
pick
out
some
aromatic
nuances
and
subtle
flavor
discrepancies
here
but
nothing
would
describe
it
as
well
as
apple
juice
not
as
sweet
and
sugary
and
of
course
much
much
lighter
but
a
carbonated
apple
juice
nonetheless
this
is
a
very
strange
brew
with
its
dark
color
and
light
flavor
its
a
paradox
in
a
bottle
i
like
this
better
than
their
blanche
de
chambly
but
its
not
as
complex
as
some
of
their
others
this
beer
poured
out
looking
very
similar
to
a
delirium
nocturnum
to
me
the
color
was
dark
brown
and
had
just
a
bit
of
clarity
to
it
the
head
didnt
last
very
long
and
hadnt
left
any
really
noticeable
lacing
the
smell
was
kind
of
roasted
but
livened
up
by
some
fruity
aromas
in
there
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
light
rusty
taste
to
it
along
with
a
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
a
boozey
heat
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
could
tell
that
from
when
i
poured
it
out
overall
i
personally
like
it
more
than
the
nocturnum
but
its
still
just
about
an
average
brew
to
me
pours
nearly
jet
black
2
fingers
of
tanoff
white
head
light
lacing
at
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
of
dark
fruit
raisin
plum
leather
dark
cherry
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
of
dark
fruit
and
raisin
with
yeast
in
the
finish
not
much
else
other
than
that
lacks
depth
in
profile
thin
mouthfeel
and
slightly
watery
carbonation
a
little
too
high
not
a
bad
brew
but
pretty
one
dimensional
and
slightly
bland
from
a
brewery
of
their
caliber
o
great
unibroue
easy
drink
and
very
complex
ive
had
a
fair
amount
of
unibroues
beers
and
this
for
me
is
their
weakest
offering
yet
and
the
mouthfeel
more
than
anything
is
what
makes
me
say
that
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
and
in
that
case
im
willing
to
try
this
again
this
is
a
heavily
malted
beverage
with
plenty
of
flavor
not
among
my
favorites
from
unibroue
but
solid
d
pretty
nice
this
beer
doesnt
taste
as
dark
as
it
looks
but
it
does
have
enough
character
malt
to
add
some
interest
the
yeast
is
prevalent
throughout
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
that
work
very
well
with
the
caramel
and
toffee
notes
very
well
done
o
so
i
was
expecting
more
here
unibroue
is
a
pretty
good
brewery
and
im
into
belgian
darks
i
think
it
lacked
quite
a
bit
in
the
taste
in
complexity
and
strength
of
flavors
overall
an
easy
drinker
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
in
my
opinion
and
one
that
i
will
be
enjoying
over
and
over
again
cant
get
enough
of
this
one
but
beware
the
chably
multipacks
seem
to
have
over
carbonated
bottles
of
noire
but
this
could
be
an
unlucky
few
cases
here
in
south
calgary
d
im
normally
a
big
fan
of
unibroue
but
this
one
doesnt
do
much
for
me
its
drinkable
and
ok
but
the
flavors
are
too
subtle
and
bland
for
such
a
dark
looking
beer
overall
good
little
dark
ale
without
the
overt
personality
of
an
alcoholbomb
recommended
from
the
corked
750
ml
bottle
with
an
expiration
date
of
031011
sampled
on
april
16
2011
the
pour
has
a
nice
looking
dark
brown
to
ruby
red
color
with
excellent
head
retention
the
aroma
has
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
along
with
a
minor
background
of
malts
and
yeast
the
taste
tends
to
bring
out
a
more
alcohollike
quality
as
well
as
a
tart
hoppiness
in
the
end
but
it
remains
delicate
on
the
tongue
throughout
i
would
like
a
bit
more
alcohol
but
everything
else
is
top
notch
its
gently
sweet
from
beginning
to
end
and
in
the
end
there
is
a
dryness
that
makes
you
take
another
swig
mvery
smooth
carbonation
released
when
swish
a
tiny
bit
in
mouth
a
litte
more
carbonation
than
i
find
ideal
but
better
than
most
o
not
one
of
unibroues
better
offerings
if
i
tried
this
again
id
want
the
freshest
bottle
possible
to
compare
nothing
offensive
it
just
didnt
hit
me
the
right
way
poured
a
hazed
dark
brown
with
some
floaties
and
chukies
into
a
chalicea
thinner
wispy
beige
colored
head
atop
spiced
phenols
in
the
nose
along
with
caramel
toffee
and
light
roastit
was
a
little
lackluster
roasted
nuts
and
caramellike
sweetness
come
thru
upfront
on
the
palate
again
lightly
spiced
phenols
as
well
as
a

this
beer
could
beer
could
be
really
good
but
it
seems
to
lack
a
big
punchthere
is
something
missing
here
overall
i
liked
this
seemed
like
a
dinner
party
beer
this
had
a
set
of
flavors
that
could
make
for
some
interesting
food
pairings

5
mm
head
that
fades
to
excellent
lacing
the
smell
is
yeasty
and
roasty
like
vegemite
the
taste
is
roasty
malt
into
a
mily
charcoal
finish
with
notes
of
sweet
belgian
yeast
the
beer
is
very
foamy
and
feels
great
in
my
mouth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
delicious
dark
ale
but
lacks
the
syrupy
sweetness
of
my
favourite
belgian
dark
ales
mouthfeel
drinkability
quite
sweet
slightly
bitter
and
full
of
belgian
yeast
slightly
darker
tasting
obviously
than
other
unibroues
maudite
or
trois
pistoles
are
much
preferred
over
this
a
little
unpleasant
upon
first
touch
of
liquid
to
tongue
d
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
the
best
part
was
the
apperance
everything
else
was
pretty
average
d
very
easy
to
drink
its
making
me
to
think
i
should
drink
lower
abv
belgians
more
than
the
higher
ones
d
a
drinkable
beer
not
overly
complex
worth
checking
out
but
certainly
not
worth
searching
or
fighting
for
makes
for
a
nice
dark
belgianstyle
without
a
lot
of
alcohol
i
thought
this
beer
did
not
stand
up
to
the
unibroue
name
it
felt
very
watery
for
a
dark
beer
and
lacked
a
lot
of
the
full
flavor
that
i
was
expecting
it
is
labeled
as
a
dark
ale
so
i
should
have
expected
the
flavor
this
beer
would
be
good
with
dinner
but
would
not
be
my
first
choice
cheers
overall
very
enjoyable
seems
like
a
rather
unique
beer
to
me
as
i
havent
encountered
anything
like
it
the
bottle
has
an
expiration
date
of
31011
so
i
cant
say
what
it
is
like
fresh
on
tap
from
st
arnolds
in
dc
served
in
a
wide
mouth
tulip
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
tall
beige
foamy
head
leaving
thin
lacing
throughout
the
session
aroma
is
a
bit
of
cocoa
definitely
dried
fruit
some
caramel
malt
toffee
toasted
barley
and
wheat
nice
yeasty
dough
scent
flavor
is
rich
creamy
toffee
malt
very
nice
toasted
grain
flavor
finishes
with
a
small
vanilla
bean
and
toffee
nuttiness
rich
medium
bodied
spicy
dry
but
bitter
finish
which
hurt
the
score
a
bit
t
what
a
strange
beer
looks
nothing
like
it
tastes
lemon
and
spice
notes
along
with
characteristic
unibroue
yeast
the
closest
thing
i
can
compare
it
to
would
be
allagash
black
but
that
might
be
better
than
this
mouthfeel
is
waaay
thin
very
little
head
of
off
white
dense
bubbles
leaving
little
thick
lace
color
is
a
29
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smells
of
prune
strawberries
cranberry
currant
and
malt
taste
are
flavors
of
caramel
raisin
cranberry
and
malt
some
smoothness
with
tingle
in
my
mouth
but
nothing
special
yes
i
would
have
another
drinkability
this
beer
is
ok
not
my
favorite
flavor
its
a
bit
like
drinking
cherry
flavored
cough
syrup
a
little
too
medicinal
i
might
be
able
to
have
one
or
two
but
id
probably
call
it
quits
after
that
its
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
d
good
brew
to
drink
and
impressed
me
as
a
black
ale
id
have
this
one
again
if
i
could
find
it
anywhere
besides
a
multipack
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
if
it
were
more
full
flavored
it
would
be
great
the
flavors
themselves
arent
bad
at
all
d
this
is
too
light
and
simple
why
pay
3
per
bottle
for
this
when
trois
pistoles
is
the
same
price
drinkability
easy
to
go
down
with
the
balance
of
flavors
however
not
as
impressive
as
other
beers
from
the
same
style
or
brewery
overall
another
very
fine
beer
from
unibroue
clearly
the
best
brewery
in
canadia
a
must
try
when
you
see
it
notes
a
well
made
unique
beer
when
considered
as
a
black
ale
and
not
a
belgian
strong
dark
drinkability
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavours
d
the
sweetness
makes
it
sodalike
not
my
favorite
but
its
very
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
relatively
mild
in
flavor
id
drink
again
but
i
might
be
hard
pressed
to
pick
it
out
of
a
lineup
drinkability
definitely
upholds
the
univroue
quality
not
my
most
preferred
of
their
choices
but
overall
a
solid
beer
d
not
bad
solid
one
of
my
least
favorite
unibroue
offerings
there
are
some
fruity
notes
dates
raisins
and
a
little
almond
but
not
much
by
way
of
complexity
or
that
would
have
you
reaching
for
more
i
let
it
sit
and
warm
up
right
to
room
temperature
to
see
if
it
had
anything
more
to
show
but
it
really
is
all
colour
and
little
flavour
deep
rich
beer
with
a
nice
head
and
great
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
malts
and
dried
fruits
dominate
the
body
si
a
bit
thin
for
such
a
beer
i
was
expecting
a
touch
more
complexity
in
the
body
as
it
is
flavours
of
raisins
and
figs
that
come
across
and
leave
much
too
quickly
carbonation
was
lower
than
expected
but
that
is
not
a
problem
imo
good
not
great
i
have
3
more
and
will
likely
be
reaching
elsewhere
for
another
beer
first
for
how
dark
this
beer
is
it
is
certainly
drinkable
and
at
6
5
you
could
stand
to
enjoy
a
couple
not
my
favorite
in
the
lineup
but
a
solid
offering
notes
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
theres
really
nothing
special
about
it
theres
nothing
distinct
to
set
it
apart
from
other
belgian
darks
in
fact
it
feels
a
little
bland
for
the
style
theres
better
out
there
pours
a
deep
red
brown
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
and
little
to
no
lacing
left
after
you
drink
smells
of
ripe
fruits
and
some
citrus
flavor
is
pretty
sour
dont
know
if
it
is
supposed
to
be
but
it
comes
through
with
plenty
of
citrus
apples
and
wheat
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
carbonation
is
heavy
drinkability
is
moderate
d
the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
given
its
high
drinkability
d
not
my
favorite
unibroue
beer
but
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
wow
im
just
blown
away
by
the
rich
red
wine
characteristics
and
rich
malty
chocolate
flavors
it
feels
like
a
nice
beer
white
hybrid
i
need
to
find
more
of
this
beer
right
away
d
havent
seen
many
dark
belgians
but
a
nicely
flavoured
beer
despite
my
ignorance
of
the
style
d
not
too
heavy
of
a
beer
perfect
for
the
octobernovember
months
would
definitely
try
again
drinkabilty
its
mild
smooth
and
fairly
low
alcohol
so
23
could
be
drank
easy
its
ok
but
im
far
away
from
this
since
i
like
tripels
and
love
quads
nice
starter
for
a
beginner
a
creamy
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
overall
pretty
mild
and
well
rounded
pretty
sessionable
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
snifter
a
dark
ruby
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
and
laced
nicely
smell
is
dark
fruits
and
spice
with
a
malt
backbone
taste
is
peppery
with
the
fruits
playing
a
bit
more
subtle
role
feel
is
very
crisp
with
carbonation
and
nicely
medium
bodied
overall
a
good
belgian
dark
that
i
will
be
looking
for
again
d
not
one
of
unibroues
more
interesting
offerings
but
still
a
very
decent
and
tasty
brew
interesting
beverage
lots
of
flavor
fairly
smooth
and
not
too
much
alcohol
that
finishing
off
a
large
bottle
is
a
bad
thing
somewhere
between
a
session
beer
and
a
sipping
beer
d
the
flavours
where
nice
but
it
did
feel
a
bit
odd
drinkability
is
okay
i
could
have
a
couple
but
it
probably
not
many
more
over
a
night
drinkability
is
fine
but
this
beer
is
really
pretty
uninteresting
d
easy
drinking
not
overbearing
interesting
ale
with
hints
of
a
stout
or
a
porter
this
one
came
in
a
taster
pack
from
trader
joes
pored
into
a
pint
glass
interesting
beer
fd
a
little
thin
for
the
deep
color
but
mixes
well
with
the
moderate
carbonation
flows
well
over
pallet
and
all
in
all
makes
for
a
good
sipping
brew
drink
another
great
beer
from
unibroue
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
one
again
worth
seeking
out
and
definitely
sessionable
very
drinkable
brew
if
you
want
to
drink
fast
and
also
a
sipper
if
you
choose
to
savor
the
flavor
i
would
say
this
is
an
all
around
quite
well
balanced
beer
and
the
first
from
unibroue
i
have
had
it
intrigues
me
and
i
hope
to
try
some
more
soon
d
medium
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
beer
but
for
unibroue
its
subpar
yet
another
in
the
long
list
of
solid
unibroue
brews
one
for
when
you
want
some
of
the
fuller
flavors
of
a
belgian
sda
without
the
higher
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
it
has
some
nice
flavors
to
it
overall
a
decent
beer
but
it
falls
short
of
a
lot
of
the
better
ones
in
the
style
750ml
bottle
pours
very
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
of
yeast
some
dark
fruits
and
malt
flavour
is
slightly
sweet
with
malt
and
unibroue
yeast
this
seemed
quite
thin
and
watered
down
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
was
kind
of
disapointed
by
this
not
one
of
unibroues
best
the
palate
is
good
dark
malts
wrapped
in
fruity
esters
and
spices
plums
and
dates
earthy
malts
and
spices
lead
into
a
light
colalike
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
effervescent
very
crisp
but
perhaps
watery
not
bad
overall
but
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
again
very
dark
purple
color
small
tan
head
some
brown
hues
big
malt
scent
dark
fruit
spicy
alcohol
the
first
thing
i
notice
about
this
beer
is
how
full
the
mouth
is
very
nice
as
for
the
taste
i
may
go
out
on
a
limb
and
call
this
unibroues
session
beer
its
not
very
complicated
its
good
dark
fruit
and
malt
a
touch
of
spice
the
chambly
noire
will
pair
very
nicely
with
grilled
fish
smoke
meat
lighter
roast
meats
sandwiches
or
light
chocolate
be
sure
to
serve
it
cold
between
two
and
four
degrees
celsius
and
do
try
it

it

of

i
got
bored
of
my
first
one
while
drinking
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
out
there
in
this
style
not
a
must
by
from
unibroue
i
am
not
sure
but
this
may
be
my
first
bda
the
appearance
screams
stout
but
just
one
smell
and
sip
and
the
lack
of
roastiness
assured
you
that
it
is
not
almost
too
mellow
for
its
own
good
but
improves
with
increased
temperature
a
nice
drop
but
there
are
better
belgians
out
there
drinkable
yes
i
must
admit
this
is
a
very
easy
to

beverage
i
liken
it
to
be

a
classic

with

down
poured
into
a
goblet
out
of
750ml
belgian
style
bottle
poured
a
nice
initial
head
that
left
pretty
quickly
the
color
is
almost
completely
black
with
an
off
white
head
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
the
belgian
yeast
esters
banana
clove
maybe
a
little
dried
fruit
somewhat
of
a
flowery
smell
off
the
pour
the
taste
is
somewhat
malty
with
some
very
nice
belgian
yeast
going
on
perhaps
some
dried
fruit
dates
prunes
finishes
a
little
dry
with
a
very
nice
fruity
after
taste
the
only
thing
that
could
have
been
a
little
better
with
this
one
was
that
it
was
slightly
watery
and
maybe
even
a
little
over
carbonated
but
i
defiantely
enjoyed
it
as
well
as
all
the
other
unibroue
beers
ive
tried
definately
some
very
quality
belgian
style
beer
and
this
one
is
definately
worth
checking
out
exspecially
if
you
want
a
nice
belgian
with
a
little
less
alchol
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
unless
they
dont
like
good
beer
drinkability
its
a
good
beer
but
theres
really
not
much
to
it
theres
almost
no
depth
of
flavor
but
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
if
it
werent
so
high
in
abv
itd
be
a
decent
session
beer
because
its
so
easy
to
drink
mouth
light
nuttiness
roasted
grains
some
mild
red
fruits
sort
of
subtle
which
is
fine
but
its
also
on
the
watery
side
especially
considering
the
very
high
carbonation
all
in
all
not
my
favorite
beer
by
this
stellar
brewery
they
make
much
better
a
tad
sweet
but
overall
id
say
this
is
successful
it
has
the
great
unibroue
dark
ale
flavor
in
lower
alcohol
form
belgian
lite
i
like
it
d
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
especially
for
a
darker
beer
d
id
have
another
but
it
isnt
the
most
drinkable
by
any
wild
stretch
of
the
imagination
an
interesting
brew
that
im
not
really
sold
on
theres
some
good
stuff
goin
on
and
the
dark
fruit
notes
mixed
with
the
wood
and
the
smoke
is
interesting
but
im
not
completely
sure
it
really
does
all
that
much
with
so
many
other
strong
belgian
offerings
this
one
just
doesnt
really
shine
theres
not
enough
to
set
it
apart
but
its
still
topnotch
and
id
take
a
glass
if
offered
just
not
something
id
seek
out
overall
this
is
probably
the
weakest
offering
ive
had
by
unibroue
so
far
im
usually
impressed
by
how
complex
and
powerful
their
flavors
intermingle
in
their
brews
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
love
the
dried
fruit
taste
and
could
easily
drink
a
six
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
so
far
based
off
of
taste
offers
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
on
the
nose
and
a
medium
rich
malty
backbone
of
dried
fruits
and
cherries
slightly
sour
after
the
beer
opens
up
a
bit
taste
follows
but
doesnt
hold
up
too
well
as
the
carbonation
extinguishes
the
finish
taste
is
lighter
than
the
color
would
indicate
yet
expected
given
the
abv
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
but
otherwise
the
beer
offers
a
good
feel
and
drink
a
nice
way
to
sample
the
style
without
the
often
accompanied
sweetness
noting
that
the
character
is
diminished
somewhat
as
well
the
first
whiff
from
the
opened
bottle
was
strongly
fruity
but
the
second
was
more
malty
with
strong
smoky
and
yeasty
undertones
it
pours
a
deep
almost
opaque
sable
with
a
tan
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
for
long
thick
rich
flavor
has
undertone
of
molasses
and
some
smoky
and
nutty
hints
and
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
texture
is
smooth
and
thick
and
finish
is
malty
and
slightly
sweet
though
there
is
a
hint
of
hops
conclusion
nice
belgian
dark
but
a
bit
light
and
lacking
in
my
opinion
tasty
but
nothing
special
really
i
have
like
all
of
the
unibroue
offerings
and
preferring
strong
ale
most
of
all
i
found
this
offering
of
weak
weak
overall
in
body
as
well
nothing
offensive
just
not
what
i
expected
at
all
from
this
brewery
this
one
have
the
same
yeasty
fruity
character
blended
nicely
with
traditional
belgian
spices
little
hopping
great
use
of
specialty
malts
to
provide
a
sweet
toffee
malt
backbone
good
drinkable
version
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
just
not
a
mind
blower
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
hardly
feels
to
be
dark
i
would
definitely
give
this
beer
a
shot

d
had
this
beer
once
before
about
2
years
ago
and
didnt
much
remember
it
id
say
go
with
unibroues
high
octane
brews
they
are
excellent
this
ones
just
a
pallid
light
belgianstyle
not
much
to
get
into
didnt
really
do
much
for
me
brown
pour
with
a
goodsized
offwhtie

vinuous
nose
with
licorice
cherries
and
spice
flat
mouthfeel
fruity
sweet
and
spicy
lots
of
grapes
turned
into
concord
grape
juice
with
beer
added
it
just
felt
as
if
somehting
was
missing
a
dark
but
somewhat
weakly
flavored
belgian
beer
from
unibroue
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
small
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
yeasty
a
bit
spicy
and
maybe
moderately
hoppy
there
are
some
herbal
notes
and
some
red
wine
flavors
but
a
disappointing
absence
of
malt
the
beer
needs
some
rich
malt
and
just
comes
off
too
light
and
too
restrained
in
the
end
the
finish
is
dry
and
the
feel
is
lively
and
fizzy
i
would
say
that
i
just
prefer
unibroues
higher
abv
offerings
but
i
loved
the
raftman
this
beer
is
just
lacking
something
for
me
the
last
of
a
sampler
pack
pours
virtually
black
but
does
have
some
deep
dark
brown
color
to
it
when
held
to
the
light
very
thick
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
a
visually
appealing
beer
smell
was
of
some
malt
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
bread
and
yeast
as
expected
from
a
belgian
taste
is
good
but
nothing
exceptional
a
bit
of
malt
some
dark
fruit
cherries
and
some
bread
and
yeast
mouthfeel
i
thought
seemed
a
little
too
thin
and
a
bit
watery
overall
a
good
beer
from
unibroue
but
i
think
they
need
to
stick
with
their
higer
gravity
offerings
not
too
bad
here
pours
a
dark
brownblack
and
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
a
very
high
amount
of
carbonation
not
much
for
lacing
in
this
one
though
taste
is
of
some
dark
fruits
i
detect
some
raisinsdates
and
is
a
very
nonbitter
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
i
felt
the
taste
was
a
bit
subdued
and
lackluster
and
while
it
was
a
good
beer
i
had
a
bit
higher
expectations
taste
dark
malts
and
fruitiness
with
a
nice
sweetness
in
the
finish
d
i
could
drink
another
but
it
was
so
meh
that
i
really
wont
bother
its
an
average
beer
from
a
brewery
that
makes
some
excellent
ones
skip
this
chambly
pours
dark
brown
with
some
cherry
reds
on
the
edges
the
head
is
huge
offwhite
and
relatively
sturdy
kind
of
like
dirty
soap
bubbles
in
the
sink
the
smell
is
of
course
evocative
of
every
other
unibroue
beer
ive
encountered
a
melonlike
sweetness
sits
atop
some
more
distinct
caramel
and
citrus
notes
coupled
with
a
faint
grassy
hop
aroma
maudite
comes
to
mind
only
a
little
sweeter
on
the
nose
and
obviously
darker
in
color
some
dark
fruits
sit
in
the
background
im
thinking
fig
on
this
one
the
first
sip
is
remarkably
smooth
and
highly
carbonated
the
carbonation
hits
the
tongue
first
bubbling
and
tingling
just
enough
to
let
you
know
it
wont
be
going
anywhere
in
the
near
future
the
caramel
notes
sneak
through
next
riding
on
the
backs
of
the
dark
fruits
cherry
and
fig
this
time
around
a
faint
grassy
finish
dries
a
little
bit
as
it
reaches
the
back
of
the
throat
its
definitely
got
some
sweetness
to
it
but
i
feel
as
if
it
plays
a
secondary
role
to
everything
else
it
enhances
everything
brightening
the
tongue
up
after
the
carbonation
assault
a
few
more
sips
leave
a
frown
of
sorts
on
my
face
as
i
get
a
watery
taste
muted
flavors
if
you
will
raisins
yeah
its
raisins
not
figs
oddly
enough
i
think
a
bit
more
tangyness
would
go
well
here
just
a
bit
of
a
bright
wheat
snap
and
i
would
be
happy
after
a
swirl
and
pour
and
some
warming
im
still
not
overwhelmed
by
this
beer
in
any
way
i
could
easily
drink
this
in
a
session
or
in
multiples
it
lacks
the
punch
of
the
other
unibroue
beers
but
its
nice
in
its
subtlety
of
flavor
pours
from
the
bottle
to
a
dark
brown
coffee
color
with
absolutely
no
head
lacing
or
visible
carbonation
nose
is
a
mixture
of
christmas
mulling
spice
and
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
toffee
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
somewhat
tingly
mouthfeel
and
a
tasty
flavor
of
vanilla
and
spices
finish
is
spicy
and
somewhat
dry
not
bad
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color

a
thick
head
that
dissolves
into
a
thin
lace
lots
of
visible
carbonation
bubbling
up
in

very
bland
with
very
little
of
not
except
subtle
dark
fruit
notes
very
sweet
and
fruity
too
carbonated
with
a
very
dry
finish
i
was
disappointed
unibroue
is
a
french
canadian
micro
brewery
which
specializes
in
belgian
styles
and
this
is
ale
is
a
stab
at
a
bottle
conditioned
belgian
dark
its
somewhat
similar
to
a
rochefort
10
in
that
it
has
a
very
fruity
nose
reminiscent
of
currants
or
rasins
however
i
found
it
a
bit
too
rich
and
treacley
not
alot
of
balance
here
between
malts
and
hops
sweet
and
bitter
it
had
a
nice
head
and
was
pleasantly
smooth
without
being
still
but
i
cant
really
recommend
this
one
from
micros
of
this
style
i
can
recommend
bells
hell
hath
no

belgian
dark

the

not
very
drinkable
drinkability
i
used
to
love
unibroue
when
i
was
a
rookie
in
the
beer
world
as
my
tastes
have
grown
ive
outgrown
unibroue
there
beers
arent
bad
at
all
just
pretty
average
with
a
couple
of
exceptions
now
a
days
i
usually
reach
for
something
else
on
the
shelf
overall
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
due
to
its
low
abv
and
nice
taste
not
so
expensive
either
not
the
best
beer
from
unibroue
as
trois
pistoles
is
but
still
another
good
beer
from
them
edit
i
downgraded
my
score
for
mouthfeel
because
i
was
definitely
disappointed
in
how
thin
the
chambly
noire
felt
and
i
could
not
go
on
saying
it
was
above
average
also
downgraded
my
score
for
appearance
because
while
it
was
very
good
it
wasnt
above
and
beyond
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
unibroue
as
i
do
all
their
offerings
this
is
likely
the
most
drinkable
with
its
lower
abv
and
i
find
it
to
be
very
sessionable
a
great
late
season
cold
weather
beer
great
choice
when
looking
for
a
great
tasting
lower
abv
relatively
speaking
brew
overall
not
a
bad
beer
probably
would
go
for
other
unibroues
when
having
the
chance
like
the
la
fin
du
monde
or
the
maudite
but
definitly
recommended
to
try
congrats
unibroue
on
another
outstanding
quality
beer
summary
if
youve
had
unibroues
quelque
chose
imagine
that
beer
without
the
cherry
flavor
and
with
a
little
more
carbonation
and
youve
got
the
idea
i
guess
i
should
review
that
little
sweetheart
d
very
flavorful
and
highly
drinkable
while
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
stronger
darks
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
at
a
relatively
low
alcohol
content
allowing
one
to
enjoy
without
sacrificing
sobriety
drinkability
a
good
enough
beer
if
you
can
get
it
on
sale
but
there
are
much
better
options
for
a
similar
price
definitely
another
good
brew
from
unibroue
who
it
seems
can
not
make
a
beer
i
dont
like
this
brewery
never
seems
to
disappoint
even
a
total
fusspot
like
myself
way
to
go
guys
keep
the
gems
comin
ok
maybe
theres
more
than
just
the
black
licorice
but
darn
it
this
stuff
is
really
fizzy
and
its
a
crying
shame
i
hate
to
give
it
such
a
high
rating
when
its
so
unpleasant
to
drink
clean
taste
to
start
with
tangy
subtle
dark
fruitiness
earthy
with
a
dry
viniousslighly
grassy
and
some
mineral
like
qualities
the
body
with
somewhat
thinnot
what
i
expected
not
a
bad
beer
just
left
me
wanting
more
not
up
to
par
with
other
unibroue
beer
ive
tried
the
mouthfeel
is
a
similar
to
soda
tastes
of
yeast
fruits
and
dark
malts
nothing
compared
to
some
of
unibroues
other
offerings
but
still
a
solid
drinker
3
5
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
but
i
wouldnt
have
too
often
due
to
liking
my
bread
less
burnt
the
6
2
alcohol
content
reminds
you
that
this
is
not
a
small
beer
very
good
as
an
appetizer
course
beer
dark
but
not
heavy
does
not
fill
you
up
prior
to
dinner
nice
head
settles
to
a
tiny
bubbled
dark
tan
cap
light
aromas
of
sweet
malts
with
syrupy
undertones
broken
lacing
but
not
much
retention
though
a
thin
ring
does
remain
nearly
opaque
and
almost
as
dark
as
a
stout
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
give
it
a
lively
and
gratifying
mouthfeel
not
smooth
per
se
but
still
goes
down
pretty
easy
spices
on
the
palette
like
nutmeg
and
black
pepper
brown
sugar
prunes
hints
of
chocolate
finishes
a
little
dry
a
good
beer
by
any
standards
but
if
youre
going
to
buy
unibroue
id
recommend
another
of
their
offerings
drinkability
is
high
id
like
to
have
another
right
now
very
surprising
drink
very
good
and
different
than
other
unibroue
beers
i
have
had
great
carbonation
gives
the
beer
a
tingly
silky
feel
good
drinkability
an
exceptionally
dark
brown
brew
with
a
foamy
and
rolling
but
quickly
fading
offwhite
head
retention
is
adequate
with
little
lacing
left
behind
some
dark
fruits
such
as
raisins
and
grapes
float
to
the
nose
also
present
are
dark
chocolates
licorice
spice
robust
yeasts
sweet
malts
and
some
caramel
that
all
lead
to
a
very
complex
and
pleasing
aroma
the
taste
is
not
as
complex
i
get
a
bit
of
spice
malts
toffee
and
some
hops
but
everything
is
subdued
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
which
leads
to
a
drinkable
but
mediocre
brew
while
unibroue
makes
some
great
beers
this
is
not
one
of
their
toptier
offerings
and
is
probably
a
good
starter
brew
for
the
neophyte
so
in
that
sense
it
serves
its
purpose
goddamn
that
sounds
arrogant
drinkability
is
good
this
is
my
new
favorite
from
uni
and
as
much
as
i
love
trois
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
all
the
time
perfect
for
a
nice
hearty
meal
d
not
too
bad
but
something
seems
to
be
almost
lacking
that
i
cant
quite
place
a
finger
on
the
lower
abv
is
appreciated
for
a
lighter
unibroue
offering
and
while
it
is
a
decent
beer
its
not
quite
up
to
snuff
with
some
of
their
others
very
clean
flavor
with
much
less
fruit
than
i
suspected
from
the
aroma
it
has
a
bit
of
a
roasty
component
that
gives
it
a
schwarzbier
like
impression
no
alcohol
is
noticeable
the
entire
time
drinkability
sort
of
muted
and
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
about
it
its
refreshing
in
many
ways
and
the
abv
is
low
but
its
just
not
all
that
impressive
a
beer
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
i
suppose
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
a
belgian
dark
taste
thats
not
911
alcohol
then
this
one
would
be
a
pretty
good
choice
d
well
nothing
here
is
offensive
in
taste
but
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
just
underwhelming
i
expect
more
from
a
belgian
dark
that
said
one
could
easily
down
this
6
2
ale
with
ease
a
very
well
balanced
drinkable
beer
although
black
in
color
it
is
not
as
heavy
as
it
looks
the
alcohol
content
6
2
adds
to
it
ease
in
drinking
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
this
style
or
any
other
style
in
fact
a
must
try
for
dark
beer
fans
with
a
low
abv
this
is
quite
drinkable
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
d
low
abv
and
decently
easy
to
drink
the
regular
belgiansas
opposed
to
the
belgian
strongs
usually
leave
me
with
something
to
be
desired
just
a
nice
mellow
tasting
dark
ale
nothing
off
the
charts
this
is
very
user
friendly
non
bas
will
enjoy
this
i
personally
like
a
little
more
brewing
flavor
muscle
flexing
than
this
offers
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
in
my
opinion
this
one
is
a
bit
thin
just
feels
too
light
the
texture
is
too
smooth
much
to
light
too
much
like
water
carbonation
is
complementary
for
the
overall
weight
of
the
body
which
in
my
opinion
gives
this
otherwise
lifeless
body
some
character
im
happy
with
this
beer
it
is
something
id
buy
again
though
ill
go
looking
for
others
before
coming
back
this
isnt
incredible
but
is
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
noire
is
right
very
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
small
light
brown
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
film
smell
is
musty
with
dark
fruit
light
bread
and
spice
the
taste
follows
suit
but
with
an
initial
sweetness
and
a
little
raisin
very
grapey
finish
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
thin
watery
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
it
has
some
great
qualities
but
its
just
not
as
complex
as
i
would
expect
from
unibroue
a
bit
of
a
letdown
but
still
a
good
beer
d
i
could
drink
more
because
it
feels
so
thin
but
the
flavor
is
not
as
complex
as
the
nose
suggests
still
a
decent
brew
impressive
appearance
thats
almost
stoutlike
a
bordering
on
black
body
rests
resplendent
underneath
a
generous
tan
coloured
head
dark
fruit
and
roasted
grains
in
the
aroma
its
really
interesting
to
see
the
fruitiness
of
unibroues
signature
yeast
play
against
the
darker
malt
flavours
of
this
beer
theres
little
sweetness
or
spice
compared
to
their
other
brews
and
here
its
replaced
by
some
smoke
and
bitter
chocolate
medium
light
mouthfeel
and
typical
high
unibroue
carbonation
while
not
as
impressive
as
their
other
stuff
this
represents
a
pretty
solid
option
d
not
as
complex
as
other
unibroues
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
the
beer
is
more
drinkable
than
the
high
abv
however
this
beer
is
somewhat
bland
i
usually
enjoy
offerings
from
unibroue
but
this
one
falls
a
little
flat
not
one
of
my
favorite
unibrous
and
in
fact
its
somewhere
near
the
bottom
it
just
doesnt
have
anything
incredibly
unique
about
it
unfortunatly
d
this
is
ok
but
a
bit
weird
allagash
black
is
far
better
still
good
for
being
different
tasted
4808
the
seltzery
mouthfeel
takes
away
from
the
enjoyment
of
a
solid
offering
a
different
beer
than
expected
quite
a
unique
ale
overall
split
a
large
bottle
with
a
friend
and
you
should
too
d
very
good
drinkability
is
decent
for
a
belgian
brew
this
is
lacking
a
quality
of
flavor
and
richness
the
body
does
not
match
the
flavors
and
the
blandness
is
a
product
of
an
undersweetened
profile
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
but
still
a
decent
brew
all
the
beers
from
unibroue
are
superior
some
are
more
superior
than
others
this
is
a
good
one
but
not
one
of
the
best
poured
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
and
sufficient
lace
opaque
brown
color
mild
malty
nose
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
toffee
flavors
the
same
but
with
stronger
caramel
notes
and
some
peat
clean
mild
finish
better
not
served
too
chilled
almost
a
session
beer
but
for
the
strength
dark
brown
without
much
head
or
lacing
the
aroma
is
also
a
bit
muted
the
but
the
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
plum
and
red
grape
flavors
with
a
hit
a
clove
i
could
have
used
a
little
less
clove
but
i
think
thats
just
me
still
a
pretty
nice
belgian
dark
ale
very
smooth
and
drinkable
worth
a
try
pours
chocolatey
brown
with
a
wispy
slightly
creamy
head
very
carbonated
nose
is
yeasty
and
slightly
chocolatey
taste
is
rather
like
an
imperial
stout
sans
hops
with
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
they
are
sweet
not
bitter
also
lots
of
yeasts
in
the
flavor
bringing
back
to
the
belgian
style
quite
bubbly
going
down
dont
drink
it
too
fast
unless
you
want
some
reverb
drinkability
very
drinkable
belgian
ale
from
unibroue
that
i
found
to
be
pretty
tasty
this
is
by
far
the
least
impressive
unibroue
concoction
i
have
yet
tasted
the
pour
is
promising
with
good
dark
ruby
color
and
an
oddly
colored
almost
gray
foamy
head
nose
is
sort
of
olive
like
with
some
yeast
taste
is
like
copenhagen
snuff
and
green
olives
the
mouthfeel
is
way
too
thin
as
is
customary
at
unibroue
with
few
exceptions
drinkability
is
docked
just
because
of
the
sheer
nastiness
of
the
taste
for
me
this
one
is
a
drainpour
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
dint
like
it
quite
as
much
as
unibroues
other
beers
but
its
only
a
matter
of
degrees
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
small
head
smell
is
a
light
belgium
yeast
character
taste
is
similar
with
roastiness
and
a
bit
of
cardboard
to
it
and
a
brightness
to
the
flavor
somewhat
cola
like
as
well
very
schwarzbier
like
and
pretty
drinkable
overall
not
bat
at
all
considering
a
far
from
favorite
style
of
mine
drinkablity
pretty
good
flavor
and
pretty
drinkable
but
it
lacked
the
complexity
i
was
expecting
d
good
dark
ale
but
there
are
many
better
that
i
would
pick
over
it
overall
just
so
so
i
am
usually
a
big
fan
of
what
unibroue
does
but
this
is
not
even
close
to
the
best
they
offer
it
is
rather
ho
hum
not
big
on
aroma
or
flavor
drinkability
is
high
there
is
no
cloying
sweetness
or
much
bitterness
i
find
it
rather
thirstquenching
which
is
a
first
from
the
fine
ales
of
unibroue
good
brew
not
something
i
would
drink
very
often
d
it
is
an
easy
to
drink
bda
but
it
lacks
a
strong
character
that
would
allow
it
to
stand
out
for
a
session
brew
this
one
hits
the
mark
medium
bodied
moderate
abv
and
pleasant
balanced
flavors
there
is
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
but
an
average
body
the
great
taste
makes
this
wonderful
to
drink
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
as
well
i
cant
wait
to
find
another
one
of
these
chambly
noire
is
the
perfect
all
season
session
beer
give
it
a
try
d
a
decent
fairly
complex
beer
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
very
good
offering
it
just
isnt
my
style
i
just
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
it
it
has
to
do
with
my
prejudice
against
certain
belgian
style
beers
d
overall
a
very
light
bodied
beer
but
big
on
flavor
full
of
dark
ripe
fruit
making
for
a
very
rich
treat
notes
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
surprisingly
laid
back
beer
that
can
be
sipped
on
for
a
long
time
another
great
offering
by
unibroue
overall
this
was
a
really
good
a
seemingly
unique
beer
its
complex
flavor
was
hard
to
pinpoint
and
almost
had
me
thinking
of
a
dunkelweizen
this
is
an
extremely
dark
beer
it
looks
black
even
when
held
up
to
the
light
and
every
now
and
then
you
get
to
see
the
dark
amber
hues
when
the
light
hits
it
just
right
it
has
a
very
thick
tan
head
that
thins
out
after
a
few
quick
minutes
but
has
very
little
lacing
it
has
a
mild
floral
aroma
to
it
with
some
hints
of
alcohol
it
has
a
clean
semi
crisp
feel
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
along
with
hints
of
roasted
malts
and
some
chocolate
and
it
has
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
the
body
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
but
it
wasnt
disappointing
i
would
reccommend
this
with
a
dinner
of
wild
game
duck
venison
or
maybe
a
nice
pork
dish
with
a
red
wine
sauce
reduction
it
could
make
an
interesting
dessert
with
a
few
scoops
of
coffee
ice
cream
or
a
nice
replacement
for
stout
in
a
chocolate
cake
goes
down
easy
enough
copped
a
single
12
oz
bottle
from
total
wine
and
more
in
union
this
beer
appears
to
be
the
younger
brother
of
trois
pistoles
similar
in
composition
aroma
and
taste
but
to
a
much
lesser
extent
with
a
more
modest
6
2
abv
still
a
very
pleasing
and
satisfying
brew
that
can
be
enjoyed
any
time
pours
an
attractive
black
ebony
hue
with
a
tan
and
frothy
head
that
soon
dissipated
within
about
two
minutes
smell
was
laden
with
cocoa
esters
and
toffee
taste
strongly
complemented
the
aroma
with
a
noticeable
chocolatefactor
that
included
a
lattelike
mocha
representation
good
crisp
and
clean
flavor
that
vacilated
between
a
toffe
and
vanilla
taste
intricate
and
complex
another
topnotch
sample
from
unibroue
definitely
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
a
letdown
and
were
it
not
decent
would
receive
a
worse
rating
for
being
insufficient
visavis
other
belgians
it
lacks
the
effervescence
of
trappistes
8
or
trois
pistoles
for
example
to
get
the
good
flavors
dancing
together
the
result
is
a
decent
beer
capable
of
more
but
falling
short
in
the
end
its
a
good
beer
but
capable
of
much
more
it
requires
more
carbonation
and
fuller
flavor
to
make
this
as
desirable
as
the
rest
of
its
wares
again
a
nice
beer
but
nice
is
usually
not
the
way
to
characterize
the
unibroue
brands
which
typically
demand
superlatives
in
the
end
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
just
have
to
try
all
of
unibroues
offerings
or
are
new
to
craft
beer
otherwise
skip
it
the
beers
appearance
looks
as
cool
as
the
bottle
label
but
the
rest
isnt
going
to
blow
you
away
well
cease
the
invite
until
tomorrow
night
when
the
gift
of
god
don
de
dieu
resumes
play
final
thought
i
bought
this
beer
for
a
second
time
this
month
so
that
says
a
lot
especially
since
i
like
to
experiment
with
new
growlersbeers
impressive
brew
taste
upfront
is
malty
with
some
caramel
tones
the
spiciness
leaves
a
lingering
aftertaste
bit
slick
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
and
would
be
better
if
a
bit
more
subtle
mouthfeel
is
delightfully
peppery
and
carbonated
finish
is
smooth
and
dry
without
being
too
dry
a
very
drinkable
ale
at
6
2
i
will
certainly
obtain
more
of
these
drinkability
not
my
favorite
unibroue
brew
but
good
all
the
same
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
them
yet
would
definitely
like
to
have
this
enjoyable
beer
again
overall
great
beer
and
totally
consistant
to
style
and
tradition
of
the
brewery
it
is
deep
and
dark
looking
which
makes
you
think
of
a
rough
and
tough
brew
but
it
is
very
light
and
refreshing
nothing
more
to
say
but
another
good
job
to
unibroue
black
as
night
beer
with
small
fizzy
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
moderate
laceing
this
beer
smells
malty
with
mild
fruity
esters
in
the
plumraisin
area
with
a
burnt
wood
finish
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
kind
of
creamy
malty
cherryish
finish
and
moderate
presence
of
phenols
which
i
can
feeltastesmell
leaving
my
mouth
after
a
sip
the
body
is
medium
light
with
sharp
carbonation
this
beer
has
a
cleanlyness
about
its
mouthfeel
that
i
can
only
describe
as
refreshing
despite
the
lingering
phenolic
presence
i
found
it
goes
down
quite
well
good
beer
taste
some
dark
fruits
plums
raisins
juicy
mouthfeel
nothing
too
complex
rather
easy
drinking
carbonation
lower
than
many
other
unibroue
offerings
tasty
enough
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
d
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
has
a
strong
fruity
flavor
but
not
like
a
lambic
its
a
beer
with
fruit
meshed
really
well
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
there
are
better
unibroue
offerings
d
this
is
a
very
good
dark
beer
from
unibroue
love
the
hoppy
fruitiness
and
love
the
way
it
goes
down
with
a
spicy
kick
very
drinkable
for
such
a
dark
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
got
to
admit
im
disappointed
chambly
noire
is
a
pretty
and
aromatic
brew
that
doesnt
quite
deliver
where
it
counts
taste
not
bad
just
not
as
good
as
anticipated
n
not
sure
why
this
ended
up
being
my
first
review
contributed
here
oh
well
not
my
favorite
unibroue
by
any
stretch
and
doubtful
id
return
to
this
beer
anytime
soon
though
i
wouldnt
complain
if
served
it
d
this
is
a
good
beer
split
with
someone
the
sourness
and
overall
fruitiness
of
the
beer
makes
it
one
you
wouldnt
want
too
much
of
its
certainly
not
a
belgian
dark
ale
as
it
is
listed
could
be
put
under
belgian
specialty
but
its
more
of
a
dark
and
fruity
beer
than
anything
a
pleasurable
and
unique
drinking
experience
though
poured
into
my
unibroue
chalice
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
brownish
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
tan
head
lots
of
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
with
some
oil
slicks
the
nose
is
malty
nice
touch
of
figs
raisins
plums
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
good
dose
of
dark
fruits
and
some
caramel
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
and
tangy
full
body
very
drinkable
i
like
this
one
very
tasty
disappointing
offering
from
unibroue
i
hope
this
is
a
onetime
release
and
not
a
new
regular
beer
the
beer
has
been
aging
in
my
apartment
for
about
68
months
so
i
finally
decided
to
drink
this
brew
it
poured
out
a
nice
dark
color
with
red
edges
and
a
brown
foamy
head
great
retention
and
lacing
smells
unexceptional
with
a
pretty
bland
nose
that
has
a
wet
burnt
malt
smell
to
it
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
with
a
well
balanced
sweet
and
richly
complex
malt
that
seems
darkened
perfectly
some
flavors
of
berry
come
out
behind
and
the
hop
flavor
is
great
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
mouthfeel
is
as
expected
and
drinkability
is
great
but
not
something
id
pound
back
a
case
of
black
color
small
wonder
with
a
tan
head
with
very
little
retention
smells
of
molasses
and
spices
very
subtle
the
taste
is
cocoa
and
oak
very
dry
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
mild
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
the
balanced
flavor
goes
down
very
easily
definitely
worth
ordering
a
second
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights
no
real
head
formed
there
was
just
a
little
foam
that
dispersed
rather
quickly
this
one
has
a
big
nose
that
contains
hints
of
ripe
dark
fruit
malts
and
yeast
the
flavor
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
strong
stout
its
not
nearly
as
intense
as
the
smell
but
nice
nonetheless
when
cold
it
truly
resembles
a
stout
only
with
a
little
more
carbonation
as
it
warmed
the
fruity
esters
come
forward
and
provide
a
pleasant
plumlike
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
mouthfeel
was
good
not
too
thin
and
not
too
fizzy
drinkability
is
good
if
you
think
of
it
as
a
stout
rather
than
a
belgian
dark
i
probably
will
never
have
this
beer
again
based
on
how
unimpressed
i
was
and
how
many
amazing
beers
one
can
get
for
the
same
price
pours
a
nice
dark
near
black
color
with
a
decent
head
but
with
no
lacing
has
a
slight
malty
scent
but
thats
about
it
for
the
scent
it
has
a
nice
taste
a
bit
deep
and
a
bit
malty
but
theres
not
much
else
goes
down
fairly
smooth
but
has
an
extraordinary
amount
of
fizz
for
a
strong
ale
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
this
beer
i
have
to
wonder
if
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
i
am
going
to
give
it
another
try
drinkabiltythis
one
is
a
6
2
so
enjoy
if
you
can
having
enjoyed
all
unibroue
has
to
offer
i
was
sadly
unimpressed
with
chambly
noire
simply
put
it
tasted
flat
and
dull
with
no
characteristics
that
i
would
label
as
above
average
it
was
just
eh
granted
i
am
no
follower
of
belgian
darks
but
have
had
nothing
bad
to
say
about
others
in
its
stylecategory
having
enjoyed
leffe
brune
a
great
deal
i
assumed
my
taste
for
more
amber
darks
would
translate
to
the
literally
noir
appearance
of
chambly
noire
unfortunately
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
boring
flat
and
lacking
in
the
spice
ive
come
to
appreciate
from
belgianstyle
beers
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
sandy
coloured
head
that
lasted
about
45
seconds
looks
good
smell
was
not
as
rich
as
i
was
anticipating
i
got
mostly
fresh
fruit
some
yeast
and
some
dank
basement
which
i
find
a
bit
odd
since
that
particular
attribute
is
typically
found
in
spontaneous
fermentation
varieties
like
gueuze
and
saison
taste
too
was
less
assertive
than
i
was
expecting
some
hops
bitternes
detectable
but
mostly
toasted
cerealtype
flavours
as
to
be
expected
from
something
this
dark
this
did
not
have
the
depth
or
complexity
i
thought
it
may
but
it
was
still
a
very
nice
ale
for
an
ale
of
this
calibre
at
6abv
i
found
this
to
be
highly
drinkable
i
will
certainly
buy
this
again
nice
d
this
is
a
nice
and
very
drinkable
belgian
dark
ale
unibroue
puts
out
great
examples
of
belgian
beers
i
will
certainly
enjoy
this
one
again
i
have
750ml
of
la
terrible
waiting
for
me
in
the
fridge
and
i
cannot
wait
to
get
to
it
flavor
of
leather
faint
freshly
cut
wood
coffee
and
figs
very
earthy
spices
include
anise
and
black
pepper
i
detect
virtually
no
hops
the
finish
is
semi
dry
with
the
wood
and
coffee
really
coming
through
mouthfeel
may
be
just
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
this
beer
isnt
too
complex
but
it
has
a
flavor
unlike
most
other
beers
this
is
the
first
product
of
unibroues
that
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
d
this
isnt
as
complex
as
other
fantastic
unibroue
offerings
but
it
more
than
makes
up
for
it
with
the
exquisite
mouthfeel
and
wonderfully
drinkable
nature
i
almost
wish
that
this
wasnt
so
damn
drinkable
since
my
seven
dollar
bomber
is
quickly
and
i
mean
quickly
disappearing
d
not
bad
at
all
except
for
the
twistoff
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
nothing
fantastic
pretty
dark
for
a
belgian
style
brew
the
smell
is
of
typical
unibroue
corriander
and
orange
peel
this
is
mixed
with
some
very
light
roasted
aromas
the
taste
of
orange
peel
and
corriander
dominate
the
taste
the
malty
base
balances
these
out
a
bit
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
belgian
type
phenols
to
be
present
still
a
good
tasting
brew
the
feel
is
moderate
and
fizzy
finishes
pretty
neutral
despite
the
stronger
than
prefered
presence
of
orange
peel
the
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
drinks
fairly
easy
last
sip
of
dark
grain
dark
brown
in
appearance
with
an
off
white
head
that
quickly
faded
with
little
to
no
lacing
smell
was
that
of
smoke
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
taste
left
a
little
metallic
thing
going
on
with
ssweet
chocolate
malts
and
a
smoked
peet
on
the
finish
highly
carbonatedmore
than
i
prefer
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
paired
with
a
caramel
or
chocolatey
dessert
for
this
style
its
pretty
run
of
the
mill
nothing
special
overall
a
good
dark
belgian
with
an
interesting
flavor
contrast
between
the
sweet
and
bittersmoky
however
it
doesnt
really
go
anywhere
and
as
such
is
just
soso
franticly
bubbled
after
the
pour
it
needs
time
to
settle
in
order
to
taste
any
thing
once
it
does
there
just
isnt
much
there
its
drinkable
at
that
point
and
thats
it
just
snoozeworthy
all
around
especially
considering
who
makes
it
carbonation
is
perfect
leaves
the
palate
refreshed
and
cleansed
nice
beer
popped
the
top
and
had
a
little
overcarbonation
but
no
spill
the
head
was
quite
large
when
poured
out
but
within
5
minutes
it
fell
into
almost
nothing
the
lacing
was
slightly
sticky
after
falling
half
the
distance
of
the
glass
almost
nothing
left
of
the
head
the
color
is
dark
but
you
can
see
through
with
a
dark
purpleish
color
smell
is
clovey
with
spices
and
belgian
candy
sugar
smell
has
some
plum
in
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
harsh
and
the
taste
has
some
definate
grape
flavor
throughout
other
flavors
are
definate
clove
a
hint
of
plum
some
definate
spices
such
as
a
slight
hint
of
cinnamin
the
nose
has
some
slight
sour
plum
this
was
definately
not
as
bad
as
my
first
bottle
i
would
have
another
bottle
of
this
since
i
dont
have
tulips
to
pour
into
i
substituted
a
similar
large
red
wine
glass
and
got
a
rich
head
like
a
coffee
crema
which
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
persistent
and
hard
to
identify
without
a
good
knowledge
of
the
belgian
style
but
it
was
just
like
worcestershire
sauce
the
flavour
is
a
sweet
malt
and
worcestershire
sauce
again
with
some
espresso
coffee
and
maybe
some
cocoa
theres
no
great
explosion
of
flavour
and
the
flavours
are
subtle
but
well
balanced
not
much
hoppiness
and
no
length
of
palate
since
its
sweet
a
reasonable
enjoyable
dinner
beer
but
rather
water
and
lacking
body
id
rather
a
schwartz
any
day
but
this
is
still
ok
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
with
ample
carbonation
very
drinkable
but
lacks
the
degree
of
complexity
that
i
was
hoping
for
unibroue
has
better
brews
the
opaque
body
of
this
dark
red
beer
was
topped
by
a
three
finger
head
and
the
entire
12
oz
pour
was
just
barely
contained
in
the
duvel
tulip
until
the
head
settled
down
to
a
craggy
fraction
of
the
original
the
smell
was
malty
with
cherry
and
strawberry
smells
being
prominent
the
taste
was
pretty
sweet
with
the
cherry
flavor
dominating
everything
else
a
bit
cough
medicine
like
but
they
do
formulate
those
to
taste
good
too
a
little
touch
of
spices
showed
up
at
the
back
end
of
each
sip
which
i
suspect
was
due
to
the
alcohol
thick
and
creamy
feeling
in
the
mouth
with
a
light
prickle
of
carbonation
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
but
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
this
every
day
coffee
black
brew
with
a
thin
but
steady
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
there
is
a
light
sour
wheat
smell
but
it
is
not
inviting
the
flavor
is
a
doughybready
white
ale
deal
yeasty
fairly
hardy
with
a
sour
aftertaste
dry
finish
may
be
true
to
style
but
just
not
my
favorite
an
ok
change
of
pace
but
not
very
drinkable
to
me
an
easily
drinkable
beer
just
not
a
very
remarkable
offering
i
usually
like
unibroue
beers
a
lot
and
i
dont
dislike
this
one
but
i
would
choose
one
of
their
other
beersmaudite
la
fin
du
monde
for
example
before
i
would
drink
this
one
again
highly
drinkable
the
lack
of
a
strong
alcohol
character
makes
for
easy
repeatable
drinking
la
fin
du
monde
was
my
favorite
unibroue
for
a
while
but
this
one
took
its
place
surprisingly
an
excellent
brew
from
a
great
brewery
sunday
afternoons
are
so
easy
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
like
i
said
its
a
bit
thin
its
a
good
beer
i
just
expected
more
flavor
sadly
a
weakbodied
watery
brew
with
little
effervescence
overall
a
fine
libation
now
if
they
can
just
give
it
some
muchneeded
body
the
only
misstep
in
the
entire
unibroue
lineup
this
beer
pours
a
semiclear
brown
color
the
head
is
large
light
tan
and
somewhat
creamy
retetion
is
nice
the
aroma
is
of
molases
dates
dark
spices
and
what
might
be
a
hintof
coriander
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
it
is
very
mellow
yet
full
of
character
and
enough
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
bodied
with
refreshingly
high
carbonation
and
of
velvety
texture
overall
i
wouldnt
consider
this
to
be
one
of
unibroues
best
beer
but
it
is
still
a
very
quaffable
brew
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
again
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
easy
drinking
belgian
whios
sesionablity
unibroues
higher
octane
beer
cannot
live
up
to
surprisingly
light
bodied
carbonation
is
right
on
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
belgian
dark
d
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
it
is
a
nice
dark
brew
one
of
the
less
interesting
unibroue
beers
but
still
good
it
might
work
best
with
food
since
its
flavor
is
quite
mellow
when
compared
to
other
beers
from
their
brewery
the
taste
is
difficult
to
fully
describe
some
spices
apple
berry
and
a
bit
of
malt
no
big
surprises
here
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
mediumbodied
refreshing
but
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
pretty
simple
seemingly
uninspired
this
beer
is
okay
its
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
however
would
i
have
it
again
yes
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
when
i
drank
this
i
felt
this
beer
to
be
a
pretty
mediocre
and
very
grapey
dubbel
although
i
can
see
that
is
categorized
in
the
milewide
belgian
ale
category
appearance
was
a
dark
brownred
with
tiny
secondaryfermented
bubbles
aroma
was
grapelike
with
some
hop
presence
flavor
was
a
deep
puckery
grape
flavor
with
more
hoppiness
than
i
expected
although
not
a
lot
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
flat
and
watery
particularly
for
a
secondary
fermented
beer
of
this
style
recommendationwise
im
sort
of
on
the
fence
on
this
one
depending
on
your
alternatives
i
might
or
might
not
recommend
it
by
the
dark
side
excellent
overall
this
beer
is
a
disappointment
the
beer
is
labeled
as
best
before
0208
so
i
cant
blame
it
for
being
too
old
oh
well
pours
a
cloudy
brownred
very
dark
lots
of
chunkies
floating
around
nice
and
yeasty
nice
thick
light
tan
head
some

to
a
thin

looks

bread
very
yeasty
bit
of
a
sour
note
in
the
finish
perhaps
a
little
past
its
prime
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
bit
of
a
pucker
in
the
finish
one
of
the
better
recent
unibroue
releases
chambly
noire
is
in
dire
need
of
an
overhaul
trouble
is
given
the
rest
of
their
lineup
im
betting
that
its
exactly
as
the
brewers
intended
i
think
ive
finally
figured
out
why
im
not
blown
away
by
most
unibroue
beer
they
brew
aperitifs
while
i
prefer
digestifs
very
very
nice
overall
good
for
1
drinking
a
750ml
on
your
own
and
2
getting
teased
by
coorsdrinking
newfies
all
in
good
fun
of
course
d
a
decent
after
dinner
drink
maybe
too
much
for
everyday
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
aroma
is
malty
and
i
cant
detect
much
past
that
except
for
some
alcohol
aroma
the
taste
is
a
different
story
as
it
starts
out
smooth
and
chocolatelike
with
some
alcohol
in
the
background
very
smooth
dark
ale
that
is
surprisingly
drinkable
despite
the
abv
leaves
a
somewhat
dry
mouthfeel
slightly
dry
creamy
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
goes
own
exceptionally
easy
very
enjoyable
not
sure
why
i
never
picked
it
up
before
but
i
know
now
that
i
will
be
grabbing
this
one
again
my
taste
buds
still
cant
quite
believe
there
are
no
concord
grapes
in
this
recipe
i
think
it
might
be
a
healthy
dose
of
dark
crystal
malts
something
like
special
b
seems
to
fit
the
bill
in
the
end
while
the
flavors
are
certainly
interesting
this
is
just
too
simplistic
the
concord
grape
note
is
just
so
big
here
i
dont
know
quite
what
to
think
this
might
actually
pair
quite
well
with
a
dark
chocolate
thing
or
so
something
that
would
cut
the
sweetness
would
be
quite
nice
i
can
imagine
that
it
would
pick
up
some
chocolate
notes
if
it
was
paired
with
an
appropriate
dessert
dish
d
a
masterful
quaffable
refreshing
supple
roasty
wheat
flavored
ale
that
i
could
appreciate
year
round
d
rather
refreshing
ive
sampled
this
from
the
bottle
and
on
draft
and
its
very
enjoyable
either
way
this
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
it
is
fairly
opaque
and
has
a
small
tan
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
much
the
smell
is
very
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
dark
malt
spice
and
dark
fruit
underneath
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
dark
malts
which
tend
to
cover
everything
else
up
front
under
the
malt
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
is
evident
and
the
taste
finishes
heavy
with
flavors
from
the
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
good
if
anything
a
touch
thin
and
too
bubbly
i
find
this
beer
to
have
a
bit
of
a
cloying
aftertaste
and
i
dont
find
it
overly
exciting
in
general
it
seems
to
fall
a
bit
below
what
it
could
be
so
drinkability
suffers
slightly
its
good
but
not
great
another
interesting
beer
one
i
may
try
again
body
is
pretty
light
and
crisp
with
a
soft
mouthfeel
and
ok
drinkability
its
just
not
an
interesting
beer
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
dark
chestnut
body
with
a
small
beige
head
patchy
lace
is
left
on
the
goblet
aroma
is
spicy
and
yeasty
raisins
and
earthy
wild
mushrooms
medium
body
is
lightened
by
an
aggressive
carbonation
taste
is
spicy
and
earthy
dark
fruit
presence
is
prunes
wild
mushrooms
evidence
the
yeasty
character
on
the
malty
side
yet
dry
on
the
finish
very
enagaing
and
quite
drinkable
but
not
overly
exciting
very
nice
somewhat
subtle
aroma
of
spice
dark
fruits
raisins
and
malt
perhaps
just
a
little
bit
too
much
carbonation
but
its
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
although
i
would
like
just
a
little
more
overall
this
is
like
a
slightly
lighter
version
of
trois
pistoles
a
tripel
that
you
can
drink
more
than
one
of
even
though
it
doesnt
knock
me
out
like
a
traditional
tripel
i
really
like
the
fact
that
i
can
have
more
than
one
without
getting
plastered
yet
still
drink
something
with
the
character
of
a
dark
belgian
beer
i
plan
to
keep
a
supply
of
this
on
hand
once
again
nice
job
unibroue
good
drinkability
alcohol
having
no
limiting
factor
here
not
as
tasty
as
other
unibroue
offerings
but
easier
to
put
a
few
away
i
could
put
one
of
these
down
fairly
easily
but
not
much
more
than
that
i
expected
more
than
i
got
from
this
one
but
it
is
still
a
decent
brew
that
is
worth
trying
still
better
than
what
id
have
gotten
at
99
of
all
bars
in
chicago
but
not
worth
the
money
at
a
bottle
shop
d
very
good
flavor
more
mild
than
expected
from
a
dark
belgian
good
balance
makes
this
another
fine
offering
from
unibroue
as
expected
this
one
is
a
little
deceiving
in
that
it
has
a
particularly
low
abv
given
its
claims
of
being
a
dark
belgian
ale
if
you
are
looking
for
a
genuine
or
even
a
faux
belgian
dubbel
this
isnt
it
the
bottle
pour
pop
color
and
lacing
are
all
very
nice
it
has
a
nice
dark
thick
head
and
smooth
pour
out
of
the
bottle
the
smell
isnt
particularly
strong
or
notable
one
way
or
another
a
little
malty
nothing
much
else
to
say
about
the
smell
the
taste
is
smooth
a
little
malty
with
maybe
a
hint
of
molasses
it
isnt
a
strong
beer
or
a
really
flavorful
beer
but
it
is
a
nice
lighter
tasting
dark
beer
with
enough
complexity
to
be
tasty
enough
and
interesting
at
the
same
time
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
sweet
beer
either
in
what
would
be
typical
of
the
belgian
dark
style
there
is
an
ever
so
small
tinge
of
a
hoppy
bite
but
not
too
much
and
not
pronounced
the
after
taste
is
a
little
metallic
and
is
the
weak
point
of
the
beer
this
has
less
character
than
say
fin
du
monde
or
trois
pistoles
from
unibroue
but
those
beers
also
have
a
higher
abv
i
liked
this
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
im
looking
out
my
window
at
a
mid
march
snow
storm
and
this
is
the
perfect
complement
a
darker
ale
that
isnt
particularly
winter
heavy
lchaim
having
been
a
long
time
drinker
of
unibroue
products
i
am
going
to
come
out
on
the
kudos
side
of
the
ledger
for
this
beer
no
it
is
not
as
good
as
fin
de
monde
et
al
but
for
the
alcohol
and
the
uniqueness
of
the
style
kind
of
like
a
belgium
ida
with
less
hops
i
like
this
beer
once
my
sample
warmed
up
i
got
all
sorts
of
dark
yeasty
notes
and
a
slightly
malty
backbone
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
aka
not
10
percent
makes
it
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
and
the
dark
malty
notes
anchor
the
brighter
belgium
flavours
that
we
expect
from
unibroue
not
a
classic
but
still
worth
buying
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
spicey
scent
that
compliments
the
dark
malt
aroma
its
sweet
smelling
with
fruity
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
rich
malt
flavor
that
is
quite
sweet
with
the
belgian
yeast
fruitiness
in
the
finish
its
full
bodied
but
loaded
up
with
co2
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
nothing
i
would
buy
in
the
future
certainly
not
the
best
from
these
guys
pours

drinkable
dark

that
never

i
might
use
this
to
introduce
people
to

overall
quite
drinkable
not

i
was

nothing

i

this
brewery
but
every
time
i
try
one
of
their
beers
im
usually
pretty
impressed
this
particular
beer
is
tasty
refined
and
very
drinkable
recommended
di
like
this
one
certainly
not
the

more

someone
did
their
research
herewe
closed
our
eyes
and
thought
we
were
in
a
café
in
belgium
ok
but
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
so
far
this
brewery
has
not
impressed
me
much
maybe
it
will
just
take
time
for
them
to
refine
their
recipes
overall
i
wasnt
too
terribly
impressed
but
i
certainly
wasnt
upset
in
any
way
at
all
either
there
definitely
needs
to
be
more
malt
but
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
this
seems
to
be
a
pretty
fresh
brewery
and
the
fact
that
their
bombers
retailed
2
for
7
makes
me
think
that
they
are
fully
aware
that
they
have
lots
of
room
to
grow
i
wish
them
all
the
best
overall
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
needs
more
malt
backbone
improve
upon
this
and
it
may
eventually
become
worthy

my
opinion

on
maltiness
a
touch
of
honey
and
cherries
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
watery
for
this
sort
of
beer
theres
not
enough
heft
to
the
beer
but
its
pretty
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
brown
ale
than
a
belgian
ale
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
the
taste
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
m
d
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
fluffy
co2
but
not
as
complex
as
expected
drinkability
is
low
on
this
one
not
a
winner
in
my
book
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
one
and
one
quarter
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
dark
citrus
alcohol
earthy
malt
slight
citrus
and
slight
hop
broadly
the
style
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
earthy
malt
hint
of
butter
slight
roasted
malt
slight
hop
and
a
hint
of
citrus
overall
good
complexity
good
aroma
but
the
earthy
notes
dominate
near
the
end
drinkability
certainly
a
noble
effort
from
a
relatively
new
brewery
but
it
falls
a
bit
shy
of
the
mark
id
say
it
could
benefit
from
a
little
boost
in
the
body
and
carbonation
still
its
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
d
i
took
down
the
bomber
in
relatively
easy
fashion
nice
session
beer
this
was
a
solid
introduction
to
cathedral
square
this
was
a
good
abbey
ale
one
that
i
will
visit
again
d
intriguing
to
say
the
least
listed
as
a
belgian
dark
ale
works
i
guess
because
its
not
a
dubbel
or
a
belgian
strong
ale
the
smoky
character
is
truly
unique
in
a
belgian
styled
brew
got
this
at
one
of
my
favorite
local
bars
and
its
pretty
rare
i
see
a
beer
im
not
familiar
with
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
pours
a
deep
red
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
that
laces
a
bit
smell
is
like
a
rich
biscuity
maltiness
it
is
similar
to
fat
tire
in
a
lot
of
ways
taste
is
similar
too
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
true
belgian
ale
but
more
like
a
red
ale
doesnt
make
it
a
bad
beer
just
imho
not
a
true
belgian
style
malty
notes
of
caramel
and
molasses
on
the
nose
followed
by
a
light
green
apple
fruitiness
fruitier
on
the
palate
but
still
maltforward
again
showing
caramel
and
molasses
yet
with
a
walnut
note
midpalate
finishes
moderately
dry
with
a
yeasty
twang
impression
not
bad
i
guess
i
have
easy
access
to
crazy
amounts
of
finest
belgian
styles
beers
and
judge
this
one
harshly
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
dont
pass
it
by
the
taste
as
a
bit
more
of
the
tree
needles
and
fruity
belgian
yeast
if
it
just
had
some
more
hops
it
would
be
more
like
a
brown
ale
ill
take
new
belgium
for
half
the
price
this
sound
like
such
a
good
idea
but
its
not
really
much
fun
from
the
mercifully
bottlecapped
750
ml
bottle
purchased
at
grapevine
liquor
in
denver
this
meeting
between
brettanomyces
a
traditional
belgian
yeast
strain
and
german
hops
yields
a
very
pleasant
and
highly
drinkable
brew
that
boasts
much
complexity
but
also
remains
approachable
rustic
and
familiar
it
grows
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
overall
give
it
a
go
if
you
like
dark
belgian
ales
and
funkwerks
but
if
not
stick
to
the
saisons
and
their
lighter
ales
provincial
which
i
believe
they
do
much
better
the
newest
bottled
offering
from
funkwerks
finally
made
it
into
my
home
it
is
a
unique
beer
that
pours
a
rust
shade
and
boasts
a
two
inch
off
white
head
thick
and
lovely
the
nose
is
sort
of
bland
compared
to
some
other
funkwerks
stuff
i
really
dont
get
the
heavy
dose
of
brett
i
was
expecting
but
there
is
a
nice
spice
element
from
either
rye
malt
or
some
added
spices
hard
to
tell
the
flavor
features
nicely
roasted
german
malts
some
fall
spice
and
a
warming
belgian
yeast
finish
its
complex
enough
but
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
up
to
the
usually
very
high
level
of
funkwerks
beers
it
seems
to
be
missing
or
lacking
something
but
maybe
age
will
help
this
one
as
the
brett
continues
to
develop
it
also
seemed
out
of
context
like
more
of
a
cold
weather
beer
but
the
craftsmanship
is
still
impressive
good
bubbles
and
a
medium
body
that
drinks
smoothly
others
in
our
group
liked
this
one
more
than
me
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
of
a
brett
influence
but
perhaps
a
good
introductory
beer
to
those
intimidated
by
or
unfamiliar
with
the
power
of
brettanomyces
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
and
onion
and
garlic
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
and
herbal
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
tastes
better
than
it
smells
in
my
opinion
im
gonna
quibble
about
the
style
designation
here
this
is
by
no
means
dark
so
perhaps
a
plain
ol
bpa
would
suffice
aside
from
that
this
is
a
tasty
decent
brettinfected
belgian
ale
not
all
that
funky
or
sour
but
evenly
drinkable
and
theres
room
aplenty
in
this
world
for
that
pours
a
maroonish
caramel
with
a
big
khaki
head
love
the
aroma
with
some
funkiness
some
bubblegum
cherryapple
caramel
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
a
little
grass
flavor
pretty
much
follows
through
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
overall
bottle
just
might
be
better
than
the
tap
variations
i
had
previously
tried
a
great
release
by
funkwerks
here
disappointing
beer
i
thought
it
looked
and
smelled
nice
but
the
flavor
is
decidedly
average
maybe
the
worst
ive
had
from
brewery
vivant
but
this
is
at
worst
uninteresting
and
drinkable
worth
a
look
most
especially
if
youre
looking
to
try
out
a
belgian
beer
that
isnt
in
your
face
didnt
really
care
for
it
disappointed
in
this
one
looks
great
but
but
is
missing
any
characteristic
that
would
make
you
want
to
drink
it
again
not
bad
not
a
drain
pour
just
average
if
you
feel
inclinated
to
try
a
belgian
beer
but
are
looking
to
avoid
a
banana
flavored
gumball
consider
yourself
kane
and
join
forces
with
the
undertaker
much
darker
than
typical
belgians
and
easy
to
track
down
in
those
great
brewery
vivant
cans
joe
tasted
similar
to
a
sour
very
good
brew
let
the
haters
hate
i
must
admit
this
brew
really
took
me
by
surprise
and
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
it
youd
never
know
it
to
look
at
it
but
the
taste
could
almost
pass
for
a
fruit
beer
or
a
smoked
fruit
beer
if
such
a
thing
exists
fortify
the
mouthfeel
and
add
some
roasted
maltier
flavors
and
brewery
vivant
might
really
have
something
special
here
as
is
this
is
a
unique
and
intriguing
beer
that
comes
off
a
little
too
juicy
for
my
tastes
from
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
the
trademark
brewery
vivant
sour
tang
presumably
from
the
yeast
used
becomes
apparent
this
is
a
well
made
belgian
dark
ale
looks
almost
like
a
porter
and
provides
a
complex
palate
agree
with
last
reviewer
not
sure
where
the
negative
reviews
come
from
very
solid
brew
and
i
dare
say
a
sessionable
strong
ale
which
is
clearly
unusual
delicious
and
as
dark
as
root
beer
loved
it
recommended
by
a
close
friend
as
his
personal
favorite
beer
i
decided
to
try
it
despite
the
lackluster
reviews
here
and
i
dont
know
where
these
folks
are
coming
from
its
a
good
strong
flavor
zero
bitterness
as
dark
as
night
i
had
one
can
in
a
mixedsixer
but
ill
be
picking
it
up
in
quantity
soon
and
sharing
a
few
cans
with
some
beerloving
coworkers
as
well
decent
taste
though
on
the
lighter
side
winey
quality
to
it
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
like
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
the
almost
burnt
malt
flavor
on
the
finish
detracts
from
a
great
front
end
on
this
beer
just
not
very
flavorful
the
lack
of
head
and
lacing
detracts
from
the
enjoyment
as
well
overall
not
something
ill
be
drinking
again
needless
to
say
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
too
bad
i
normally
love
dark
belgians
and
im
going
to
be
wary
of
this
brewery
too
this
was
my
first
taste
of
anything
theyve
produced
16
ounce
can
into
tulip
glass
no
canning
date
but
is
a
recent
release
pours
clear
nearly
pitch
black
color
with
a
1
finger
fairly
dense
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
lacing
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
with
a
fair
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
raisin
prune
banana
chocolate
roasted

dark
bread
light
coffee

very
nice

with

balance
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
smooth
lightly
slick
and
fairly
bready
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
dark
ale
all
around
good
balance
and
complexity
of
fruityearthy
yeast
and
darkroasted
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
as
i
finished
this
off
i
made
the
comment
that
this
is
almost
a
lambic
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
and
unique
version
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
it
had
all
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
i
would
expect
from
the
style
but
in
this
beer
i
found
the
malt
profile
to
be
more
roastier
and
robust
than
most
in
the
style
and
i
think
that
really
represents
the
american
influence
this
beer
has
its
kind
of
like
the
best
of
both
worlds
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
a
little
crisp
fairly
dry
on
the
finish
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
think
a
couple
of
these
would
be
a
good
amount
for
me
and
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
fall
time
beer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
both
the
aroma
and
taste
were
balanced
really
well
and
neither
the
malts
or
the
yeast
were
too
overpowering
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
would
want
to
change
its
great
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
could
see
keeping
some
in
the
fridge
during
the
fall
since
i
think
it
would
make
a
fine
bonfire
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
and
it
might
make
for
a
good
and
easy
drinking
introduction
to
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
exactly
how
i
remember
it
being
like
on
tap
at
brewery
vivant
so
my
score
doesnt
change
at
all
this
isnt
my
favorite
brewery
vivant
beer
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
belgian
dark
ales
ive
had
so
far
its
nice
to
have
a
beer
like
this
available
in
pint
cans
and
i
could
for
sure
see
myself
taking
some
on
a
camping
trip
good
job
guys
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
in
the
slightest
keep
up
the
great
and
unique
work
overall
a
very
tasty
and
balanced
belgian
dark
good
juicy
dark
fruit
character
and
lots
of
good
yeast
qualities
a
step
up
from
solitude
in
my
opinion
definitely
a
good
step
for
vivant
o
in
certain
ways
appealing
and
another
repulsive
an
odd
one
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
high
levels
of
carbonation
leading
to
a
fizzy
then
softly
foamy
mouthfeel
closes
dry
with
little
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
and
lips
truly
fantastic
beer
and
very
enigmatic
you
have
to
swiftly
chase
its
multiple
taste
facets
though
aint
for
all
beer
drinkers
while
drinking
i
did
some
research
given
my
rates
were
off
much
higher
but
rest
in
peace
after
knowing
no
wonder
to
be
one
of
favorites
by
the
beer
hunter
pretty
enjoyable
beer
there
are
a
few
aspects
it
could
improve
a
bit
much
carbonation
it
is
quite
well
balanced
though
a
bit
tartspicy
on
finish
together
it
isnt
the
most
memorable
beer
nice
dark
ale
with
a
fair
bit
of
yeasty
presence
that
has
some
issues
incorporating
into
the
beer
sometimes
feel
thin
i
wouldnt
rush
to
get
this
again
but
its
nice
nonetheless
o
amber
beers
wont
be
my
number
one
but
in
its
style
its
maybe
one
of
the
best
a
nice
sourish
brew
should
be
good
with
cave
matured
cheese
this
is
an
odd
one
indeed
the
best
before
states
its
good
until
jan
of
2013
however
there
are
already
oxidization
issues
creeping
into
it
amongst
other
issues
seems
to
me
this
is
not
aging
well
especially
given
the
ingredients
list
on
the
back
labelnot
living
up
to
its
potential
happy
at
the
chance
to
try
such
a
rare
beer
however
based
on
my
sample
i
wouldnt
recommend
bending
over
backwards
to
procure
one
disappointing
indeed
from
st
bernardus
who
tend
to
be
exemplar
with
whatever
they
produce
id
suggest
serving
this
beer
in
a
tulip
glass
rather
than
the
wide
goblet
i
chose
where
it
seemed
to
get
a
little
lost
one
of
the
late
great
michael
jacksons
favourite
beers
before
he
died
i
have
to
wonder
whether
the
recipe
has
changed
as
while
this
certainly
qualifies
as
a
good
beer
to
me
it
falls
well
short
of
greatness
o
a
good
belgian
style
dark
ale
not
a
lifechanger
but
i
could
certainly
go
for
another
overall
a
drinkable
beer
needs
more
hops
to
balance
it
out
o
nice
and
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
overall
quite
complex
brew
very
sharp
and
spicy
i
like
it
but
not
too
often
the
body
is
highly
carbonated
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
beautifully
balanced
one
of
the
best
bdas
ive
ever
enjoyed
od
probably
a
good
intro
to
more
sour
beers
not
the
best
example
of
something
venturing
in
these
waters
but
a
decent
beer
and
worth
a
try
if
you
want
something
with
a
slight
sour
note
that
is
quite
refreshing
entrylevel
belg
brown
too
lively
to
quaff
and
no
complexity
but
easy
enough
otherwise
certainly
an
interesting
beer
very
unusual
and
memorable
taste
but
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
like
to
drink
it
very
often
d
this
is
a
beer
that
has
a
bit
of
everything
and
yet
retains
balance
a
smell
of
spring
in
the
cellar
first
nosing
the
yeast
is
very
aromatic
and
through
the
scents
of
musty
old
and
very
valuable
one
can
sense
a
nose
finely
alcohol
the
mouth
does
not
really
follow
the
same
logic
as
it
has
an
ease
to
drink
very
impressive
with
hints
of
sherry
oloroso
obviously
like
any
beer
pierre
celis
we
find
a
whole
bunch
of
spices
exotic
enough
a
mixture
which
is
a
little
like
the
fruit
défendu
fairly
long
finish
slightly
medicinal
a
little
lack
of
surprise
over
a
method
that
is
meant
extremely
original
caramel
and
herbs
are
hidden
in
the
beer
there
are
better
dark
ales
and
there
are
better
bernardus
beers
than
this
one
but
you
all
know
that
d
abv
is
very
wel
hidden
but
im
not
à
big
fan
drinkability
i
am
really
regretting
not
buying
a
750ml
i
will
most
certainly
have
this
one
again
a
decent
beer
not
amazing
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
especially
for
the
price
just
under
17
it
could
be
just
a
gimmick
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
very
tasty
malty
fruity
belgian
ale
lots
going
on
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
like
it
d
this
is
really
good
stuff
during
my
next
trip
down
to
the
limburg
region
ill
try
to
score
some
more
d
good
beer
to
drink
in
a
cave
or
anywhere
else
another
hit
and
a
complex
almost
vinous
flemish
beer
bottle
at
chancey
smiths
a
deep
and
clouded
muddy
brown
with
a
frothy
beige
cap
that
laces
well
nose
of
yeasty
funk
candy
sugar
caramel
spices
and
floral
notes
tastes
sweet
but
with
a
funky
yeasty
twang
prune
and
caramel
with
an
almost
sour
yeast
presence
meets
floral
hoppiness
with
an
oaked
aspect
creamy
funky
and
sweet
finish
with
good
lingering
aftertaste
very
good
thanks
milos
definitely
above
the
average
but
still
the
best
experience
i
had
with
this
beer
was
its
label
d
good
but
my
least
favorite
coming
from
the
bernardus
brewerynot
counting
the
tripel
since
in
general
i
dont
like
tripel
taste
doesnt
really
live
up
to
the
smell
bottle
mostly
likely
aged
for
a
year
or
so
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
some
light
spices
pepper
allspice
even
and
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
flavor
of
yeast
and
sweet
fruits
initially
with
some
roasted
malt
and
spices
in
the
finish
pretty
decenti
was
a
little
scared
of
this
beer
considering
that
i
didnt
know
how
old
it
washow
well
it
held
up
over
time
but
it
was
fine
not
too
sweet
either
which
often
plagues
some
abbey
dubbels
nice
beer
4
5
d
i
fail
to
compare
this
to
my
last
six
bottles
consumed
in
the
uk
and
belgium
during
the
past
several
years
as
no
notes
of
them
are
left
but
this
bottle
shows
a
stability
of
texture
and
flavour
even
aroma
which
i
hadnt
expected
before
opening
the
bottleperhaps
ageing
does
make
a
difference
this
is
very
much
my
cup
of
tea
relatively
lowprofile
for
its
style
while
providing
almost
all
the
same
satisfaction
a
cup
of
spiced
tea
can
bring
the
only
difference
being
that
this
one
comes
with
alcohol
and
some
grainy
flavour
i
picked
up
this
bomber
for
8
99
at
palmers
in
columbus
the
beer
is
dark
copper
color
clear
with
a
hint
of
haze
and
has
a
thin
offwhite
foam
comprised
of
relatively
large
bubbles
the
aroma
is
nearly
perfect
a
wonderful
mix
of
esters
and
phenols
all
sorts
of
fruits
from
plums
to
bananas
the
taste
is
strong
with
these
fruits
very
rich
and
flavorful
bananas
plums
a
little
apple
and
some
caramel
malty
sweetness
holding
everything
together
actually
i
found
it
to
smell
and
taste
very
similar
to
prior
8
possibly
with
extra
banana
exceptional
beer
from
an
exceptional
brewery
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
yeast
fruitiness
the
esters
meld
well
with
a
crystal
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
mix
of
malts
and
fruits
its
easy
going
down
with
an
almost
refreshing
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
nice
roasted
element
that
really
seems
to
thrive
with
the
belgian
yeast
enjoyable
brew
pour
is
murky
copper
with
a
lot
of
head
and
carbonation
aroma
is
dried
fruits
yeast
and
malts
taste
is
very
pleasant
and
not
overwhelming
heavily
malted
with
candied
fruits
and
some
spice
finish
is
a
bit
sticky
with
some
alcohol
warmth
a
good
seasonal
beer
overall
it
is
interesting
but
quite
dry
for
a
brown
i
would
probably
choose
it
over
some
of
the
makeshift
bruins
here
in
belgium
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
delicious
just
the
same
but
a
bit
subdued
unusual
offering
at
first
grottenbier
might
seem
a
little
simplistic
or
equal
in
tone
but
this
only
means
the
opportunity
to
truly
taste
or
degustate
as
it
is
commonly
named
in
belgium
poured
into
a
goblet
this
beer
has
a
nice
cherrywood
color
and
nice
lacing
that
diminishes
in
5
minutes
or
so
not
an
overly
noticable
or
pronounced
nose
slight
maltiness
with
good
bitterness
and
mild
hops
this
beer
has
a
nice
spiceness
and
not
the
least
bit
sweet
this
beer
in
my
opinion
is
a
great
introduction
to
belgians
for
those
that
have
never
tasted
one
well
done
and
certainly
a
worthy
belgian
dark
ale
ive
had
it
more
than
the
once
and
im
sure
ill
be
back
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
dark
ale
despite
the
mouthfeel
issue
this
was
a
nice
belgian
brown
easy
on
the
palate
d
not
too
bad
but
not
really
my
thing
worth
a
try
but
not
something
id
bother
with
again
pours
a
deep
amber
to
a
brownish
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
earthy
and
barnyardy
malt
and
a
small
sourness
in
the
taste
quite
malty
and
a
small
sour
white
grape
flavor
a
lighter
body
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
small
dry
to
malty
sweet
aftertaste
the
small
sourness
is
nice
light
and
easy
to
drink
almost
session
like
poured
with
and
nice
head
with
plenty
of
lace
brownish
color
with
some
amber
and
cherry
highlights
malty
body
but
not
too
thick
some
sweettartness
dark
fruits
toffee
and
some
yeasty
flavors
predominate
very
nice
good
finish
dont
notice
any
alcohol
interesting
beer
getting
harder
to
find
looks
a
brownred
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
sweet
bready
belgian
spice
with
dry
raisins
with
a
similar
taste
im
not
finding
this
to
be
the
most
complex
belgian
brown
but
its
very
drinkable
and
pairs
very
nicely
with
a
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
easy
drinking
decently
balanced
the
feel
is
probably
the
best
part
about
this
beer
it
does
finish
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
the
goods
outweigh
the
bads
in
this
category
pours
a
dark
clear
ruby
with
a
nice
tan
head
nose
is
sugary
sweet
and
yeasty
with
a
pungent
tone
to
it
overall
flavor
is
smooth
woody
and
sweet
low
yeast
flavor
but
an
underlying
sweet
tone
that
hits
the
tip
of
your
tongue
and
never
comes
on
strong
at
all
woodlike
aftertaste
feel
is
a
perfect
balance
of
carbonation
and
use
of
ingredients
overall
a
damn
good
brew
even
and
well
balanced
and
one
i
would
constantly
go
back
to
time
and
time
again
another
trailblazer
from
pierre
celis
malty
sweet
yeast
and
a
faintly
musty
aroma
hazy
brown
with
a
fading
head
some
pleasant
mustiness
comes
through
here
as
well
spicy
yeasty
flavor
with
hints
of
fruitcake
tail
is
mostly
dark
fruits
with
some
roasty
malt
character
d
solid
sipper
decent
drinkability
a
fairly
interesting
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
as
a
footnote
i
purchased
this
bottle
in
aubel
on
my
way
to
the
caves
grotten
in
valkenburg
which
is
one
of
the
towns
the
beer
celebrates
mouthfeeldrinkability
enormously
billowy
and
overly
gassy
when
the
yeast
is
added
the
mouthfeel
becomes
creamier
average
for
the
style
imo
overall
a
pretty
good
dark
ale
definitely
needs
to
be
at
room
temperature
though
also
might
benefit
from
some
aging
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
brown
ruby
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
on
top
with
a
nice
retention
nose
is
complex
with
fruity
notes
of
fig
and
some
spicy
soy
sauce
along
with
musty
horse
blanket
and
sour
yeast
taste
begins
with
dark
caramel
and
sweet
raisins
followed
by
tart
black
cherries
there
is
also
some
spicy
pepper
and
ginger
root
along
with
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
barnyard
funk
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
e
brad
an
extremely
impressivelooking
750ml
bottle
and
with
pierre
celis
signature
on
it
im
eager
to
give
it
a
whirl
very
carbonated
with
a
fairly
dense
rocky
head
forming
over
the
ruddy
brown
beer
tiny
bubbles
form
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
goblet
smells
of
cinnamon
not
much
else
in
the
smell
but
i
probably
have
the
bottle
a
bit
too
cold
at
the
moment
the
taste
starts
off
promising
that
cinnamon
leading
off
promising
more
to
follow
then
nothing
immediately
turns
very
dry
and
almost
seems
to
evaporate
off
the
tongue
without
leaving
any
flavor
except
a
vague
cinnamon
aftertaste
that
comes
on
later
mouthfeel
is
similar
starting
full
but
that
dryness
just
takes
it
all
away
and
it
finishes
thin
really
surprising
for
a
beer
of
this
color
pedigree
not
terribly
drinkable
as
it
just
leaves
me
wanting
to
have
a
beer
very
one
dimensional
beer
overall
not
terrible
but
just
not
impressive
overall
impression
great
beer
i
hand
carried
this
back
to
texas
from
belgium
to
find
2
weeks
later
it
had
arrived
on
local
shelves
great
to
see
pierre
in
texas
looking
forward
to
enjoying
more
of
his
work
in
the
future
this
certainly
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
for
the
price
i
couldve
bought
something
stellar
id
stay
away
from
this
one
drinkability
very
balanced
medium
body
high
but
not
overbearing
carbonation
balance
is
excellent
malt
takes
the
lead
but
the
hops
come
in
just
right
in
the
finish
everything
melds
together
well
drinkability
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
i
was
definatly
expecting
a
little
more
though
the
flavors
were
pleasant
but
they
came
in
quick
flashes
overall
the
beer
had
a
more
refreshing
quaffable
quality
than
anything
way
to
hyped
drinks
pretty
easy
not
a
bad
belgian
dark
just
nothing
special
poured
out
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
lasted
a
long
time
ok
lacing
the
nose
offered
bready
malt
sweet
bananas
some
sour
cherry
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
and
something
reminiscent
of
sticky
buns
the
taste
was
rich
with
malt
flavors
again
i
get
a
abked
good
flavor
something
with
sweet
sticky
caramel
or
icing
and
a
little
fruity
finish
is
a
bit
long
malt
sticky
and
stays
with
you
for
a
while
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
with
no
date
on
bottom
of
bottle
into
my
chimay
goblet
had
a
good
head
that
ebbed
down
to
a
constant
thin
head
that
also
stuck
to
the
sides
throughout
was
a
dark
amber
with
good
carb
nice
sweet
malt
smell
with
hints
of
the
alcohol
within
the
taste
was
excellent
and
makes
this
one
of
the
best
belgian
darks
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
only
thing
keeping
it
out
of
my
regular
rotation
is
the
price
9
for
750ml
4
rrp
t
y
poured
a
deep
tawny
brown
with
some
ruby
tint
a
thinner
light
brown
head
sat
atopbig
spice
in
the
nose
that
of
cinnamon
and
clove
with
some
pruneraisin
underlying
as
well
again
the
flavors
are
quite
spicey
maybe
even
a
little
over
the
top
in
that
departmentclovey
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
even
a
touch
of
ginger
there
is
a
dark
fruit
element
but
it
seems
to
take
a
backseat
to
the
spiced
flavors
eh
its
decent
but
not
alot
of
character
and
a
little
one
dimensional
flavor
wise
in
my
mind
d
at
6
7
abv
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
for
a
belgian
without
the
sipping
limitation
went
well
with
a
spicy
garlicky
frittata
25
4
oz
75
cl
tall
straight
brown
winelike
bottle
corked
and
caged
this
bruin
had
rekindled
my
affection
for
the
style
after
being
put
off
for
quite
some
time
we
all
have
over
done
it
once
or
twice
i
was
once
again
impounded
by
a
quality
beligan
brune
excellent
aroma
great
retention
and
both
mouthfeel
and
flavour
full
of
complexity
notes
of
dark
fruits
nuts
and
musty
yeast
a
sensible
yet
bewildering
bruin
d
due
to
the
wellbalanced
taste
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
without
giving
my
tongue
too
much
of
a
lashing
with
an
agreeable
taste
and
aroma
from
the
cave
aging
it
was
surprisingly
good
in
an
unsurprising
way
a
nice
deep
redbrown
with
a
decent
head
looks
nice
nose
is
sweet
alcohol
spicy
cardamom
and
the
slightist
metallic
whiff
tatse
is
spicy
but
mellow
like
cumin
doesnt
taste
like
a
belgian
dark
ale
its
more
wheat
oddly
but
with
a
malty
aftertaste
hint
of
ethanol
on
the
finish
interesting
combo
drinkability
is
good
and
mouthfeel
is
frothy
and
nice
and
tingly
grotten
brown
is
a
wonderful
bda
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
a
quick
look
at
my
reviews
tells
me
that
its
the
best
that
ive
ever
had
by
a
fairly
wide
margin
i
could
just
as
easily
have
chosen
the
higher
taste
score
it
was
that
close
the
bottom
line
is
that
im
not
sure
theres
another
beer
of
this
style
that
is
capable
of
giving
it
any
serious
competition
on
tap
at
bxl
in
nyc
the
beer
had
a
nice
dark
brown
color
and
a
light
brown
head
the
aroma
was
not
as
fruity
as
i
expected
from
a
stronger
belgian
ale
and
indeed
i
dont
think
this
is
really
a
belgian
dark
ale
its
more
like
a
belgian
porter
if
you
could
imagine
such
a
thing
it
had
some
roasty
notes
in
the
aroma
and
also
in
the
flavor
but
it
was
not
harsh
at
all
and
seemed
more
licoricelike
and
also
had
hints
of
chocolate
as
well
as
some
malty
sweetness
maybe
was
a
little
light
on
the
mouthfeel
which
seemed
off
but
overall
it
was
rather
good
and
i
recommend
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
but
finishes
fairly
sharply
leaving
a
spice
perfume
bottle
was
served
cool
seems
to
be
best
at
a
constant
cool
temp
this
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
generous
head
the
smell
must
be
teased
out
with
a
little
swirling
but
the
most
dominant
flavor
is
medium
malts
with
a
hint
of
sourness
the
taste
is
great
and
just
what
i
would
expect
from
st
bernardus
while
there
is
largely
one
taste
that
dominates
the
mouthfeel
its
pretty
big
and
depending
on
the
temperature
many
things
can
be
picked
out
malts
are
really
what
takes
charge
throughout
though
and
the
smoothness
is
impressive
beer
poured
a
mahoganybrown
color
with
an
awesome
long
lasting
tan
head
nose
is
sweet
with
fruit
tones
on
top
of
the
malts
taste
is
of
pale
malts
has
hints
of
apple
and
a
dark
fruit
with
a
nice
hop
finish
style
is
more
a
bpa
than
a
belgian
dark
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
but
finishes
thinner
than
hoped
drinkability
is
good
as
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
drinkability
ill
drink
this
again
if
i
can
find
it
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
its
just
cool
when
my
friends
ask
what
i
am
drinkin
to
reply
beer
from
a
belgian
cave
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
really
enjoyable
in
my
opinion
frankly
id
drink
this
over
many
smaller
dubbels
i
just
noticed
that
grotten
brown
and
nbb
1554
are
listed
as
the
same
style
on
ba
insane
you
got
to
love
belgian
beers
i
understand
why
they
both
are
considered
belgian
dark
ales
but
wow
they
are
100
different
for
some
reason
i
bet
this
beer
would
kick
major
ass
with
a
gourmet
grilled
cheese
sandwich
and
a
side
of
fresh
grapes
i
think
i
over
paid
a
bit
for
my
750ml
i
purchased
in
west
des
moines
ia
but
i
wanted
to
try
this
one
st
bernardus
pierre
celis
should
greatness
well
it
really
didnt
still
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
say
try
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
vibrant
champagneesque
carbonation
that
rushes
across
the
palate
and
makes
it
a
bit
creamy
this
is
a
tasty
brew
that
doesnt
fail
to
impress
me
i
can
definetly
see
myself
picking
this
one
up
again
in
the
future
a
tasty
spicy
belgian
brown
ale
thanks
again
to
my
parents
for
this
one
cheers
the
hops
came
through
very
clearly
in
the
flavor
as
did
a
touch
of
malts
and
yeasts
most
noticable
was
how
very
bone
dry
this
beer
was
i
was
a
bit
disapointed
in
the
overall
flavors
of
this
beer
it
ts
apearance
was
wonderfull
but
though
not
bad
i
felt
that
it
lacked
anything
that
would
make
it
stand
out
against
any
other
belgain
brown
that
i
have
had
surprised
at
the
style
classificationthe
beer
tasted
like
a
very
good
oud
brune
a
hazy
brown
brew
with
mild
red
highlights
decants
from
the
bottle
with
a
overwhelming
carbonation
and
loosely
knit
head
retention
solid
malt
bready
fruity
aromas
combine
with
a
tart
almost
sour
note
that
promises
complexity
flavors
of
sweet
candy
and
malts
are
challenged
by
moderate
earthy
hops
winelike
tartness
and
a
pixie
sticklike
sweet
tartness
the
sourning
compliments
the
fig
date
plumb
flavors
nicely
without
dominating
very
creamy
and
bready
to
the
texture
with
that
crazy
belgian
yeast
twang
finishes
with
a
vineous
dryness
and
a
resisual
sweetness
to
allow
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
the
oly
hitch
is
an
astringent
bite
in
the
back
of
the
throat
that
doesnt
seem
to
be
hop
derivenmaybe
a
bit
too
grainy
nevertheless
the
beer
exemplifies
why
this
is
my
favorite
breweryperiod
thanks
clvand0
nice
brown
the
cave
thing
dont
know
what
that
does
but
im
happy
with
it
teaser
loves
the
labels
im
finding
this
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
its
not
too
strong
in
alcohol
so
its
nice
drinking
d
good
not
remarkable
taste
was
again
herbal
and
caramellic
with
the
nutmeg
coming
through
and
some
peppery
notes
the
beer
was
sticky
and
had
a
medium
body
very
little
bitterness
and
rather
bland
i
feel
that
this
beer
could
use
some
freshness
or
at
least
some
more
character
i
found
the
herbs
as
mentioned
on
the
label
to
be
more
distracting
than
adding
anything
to
the
beer
taste
is
slightly
bitter
not
sure
i
care
for
the
bitterness
in
this
beer
or
is
it
more
of
a
fruity
tartness
i
cant
tell
but
it
seems
to
be
lacking
in
the
taste
what
i
found
in
the
aroma
no
spice
as
far
as
i
could
tell
in
the
taste
nor
the
yeasty
character
no
sweetness
at
all
which
kinda
made
the
tartbitter
a
little
to
rought
for
my
liking
it
does
finish
very
dry
and
leave
a
plum
like
taste
in
my
mouth
when
i
exhale
for
quite
some
time
again
its
a
bit
to
dry
in
the
end
for
my
taste
d
this
taste
like
the
little
brother
of
some
of
the
bigger
abbey
beers
it
had
good
balance
and
nice
flavor
but
it
wasnt
trying
to
be
a
big
huge
beer
this
would
be
a
nice
winter
session
beer
ruby
red
when
held
to
light
with
a
soft
head
that
leaves
a
ring
around
glass
and
a
spotty
lacing
immediate
smell
of
iron
with
smells
of
bread
and
a
slight
hint
of
plum
is
hidden
in
there
as
well
yeasty
a
bit
of
iron
nuts
clove
dark
fruit
and
toffee
in
the
taste
light
on
the
tongue
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
it
was
an
alright
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
again
the
mouth
is
quite
puckering
while
the
nose
got
me
exciting
the
flavors
were
a
bit
of
a
let
down
ruby
and
brown
shades
with
decent
clarity
a
beautiful
12
inch
head
of
white
foam
sits
atop
with
solid
retention

is
a
bit
faint
with
notes
of
raisin
cherry
and
other
dark
fruit
lightly
sweet
brown
sugarcinnamon
malt
mixes
with
mild
spice
also
in
the
nose
the
malt
flavor
is
semisweet
and
tangy
and
begins
with
the
dark
fruit
flavors
dominating
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
is
detectable
toward
the
finish
slightly
earthy
tones
are
present
also
as
well
as
a
bit
of
phenolic
flavor
medium
thick
but
has
a
rich
creaminess
making
it
smooth
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
nice
i
thought
this
brew
had
a
nice
overall
flavor
and
it
seemed
mild
making
it
very
drinkable
recommended
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
moderate
head
of
medium
to
large
tan
bubbles
lightly

flavor
i
split
the
bottle
with
gdogalicious
and
we
were
in
agreement
slight
molasses
maybe
dark
candy
sugar
is
there
but
overwhelmed
by
the
yeast
character
fades
into
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
not
real
impressed
with
this
one
more
odd
than
good
bottle
poured
a
muddy
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
head
with
pretty
good
retention
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
slightly
funky
belgian
yeast
is
quite
evident
caramel
malt
with
some
spices
dominated
the
taste
at
first
and
then
the
yeast
signature
shows
up
with
a
slightly
funky
feel
body
is
quite
full
but
could
have
been
fuller
and
carbonation
is
perfect
imho
a
bit
more
alcohol
and
body
would
do
wonder
for
this
beer
sweet
candy
sugar
and
malts
up
front
like
a
good
brown
ale
should
then
fading
into
a
musty
basement
flavor
is
this
the
cave
aged
part
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
copperybrown
color
there
was
a
big
fluffy
offwhite
head
on
mine
it
hung
around
for
a
little
while
the
aroma
is
nice
it
is
somewhat
bready
with
hints
of
fruits
some
spices
including
cloves
start
to
come
up
as
it
warms
a
bit
the
taste
is
actually
a
touch
peppery
when
it
hits
your
tongue
also
a
touch
dry
it
does
contain
nice
notes
of
some
dark
fruits
as
well
as
a
toffee
malt
taste
this
is
quite
nice
overall
a
nice
belgium
to
sip
at
it
didnt
wow
me
but
i
easily
drank
the
bottle
and
wouldnt
decline
it
in
he
future
a
little
pricey
at
8
60
might
not
be
worth
that
price
but
if
you
can
find
it
for
around
56
scoop
it
up
body
is
solid
medium
with
eggagerated
carbonation
and
a
smooth
silky
texture
and
full
expansive
mouthfeel
this
is
something
that
could
be
drank
en
mass
just
complex
enough
to
keep
your
attention
whild
doing
a
fine
job
of
slaking
your
thirst
brilliant
carbonaton
feels
divine
in
the
mouth
with
the
right
carbonation
to
go
with
it
all
hoppy
bitterness
to
the
end
but
overall
very
refreshing
i
could
drink
lots
of
this
the
case
of
this
that
i
just
cellared
will
certainly
give
me
plenty
of
enjoyment
drinkability
a
very
pleasant
sipper
certainly
not
as
challenging
as
many
other
belgian
styles
this
is
nice
there
is
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
just
nothing
really
special
about
it
either
pours
a
fine
head
that
falls
into
a
thin
layer
with
a
very
strong
lacing
made
of
millions
of
tiny
bubbles
that
look
pillowy
so
many
smells
hit
my
palate
from
metalic
to
sweet
smells
the
taste
and
smell
of
the
hops
is
very
suttle
but
it
creates
a
little
different
flavor
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
a
little
smooth
its
very
watery
on
the
tongue
the
more
and
more
you
drink
this
beer
the
less
flavor
and
body
there
is
i
strongly
recommend
this
beer
but
i
must
add
the
caveat
that
negative
reviews
by
otherwise
reputable
and
wise
individuals
appear
to
make
this
one
hitormiss
this
beer
came
a
dark
brown
with
slight
purple
highlights
and
a
smooth
creamy
dirty
tan
head
smelled
smoky
and
earthy
with
some
pleasant
dark
fruits
musky
nuts
and
dry
spices
mixed
with
yeast
the
flavor
begins
with
an
initial
dark
bitter
malt
that
runs
into
a
neat
red
wine
dryness
that
is
mixed
with
earthy
nutmeg
and
oregano
this
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
variety
of
fresh
earthy
notes
that
made
me
think
of
a
beer
picked
fresh
from
some
sort
of
magical
beer
garden
very
fresh
and
delicious
the
earthy
liveliness
of
this
beer
trails
off
in
the
finish
this
i
appreciated
as
dinner
came
shortly
after
i
began
the
beer
the
mouth
feel
was
light
bodied
with
lots
of
light
carbonation
this
is
a
fantastic
sipper

notes

also

a

with
a
light
bite
on
the
finish
i
enjoyed
it
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
flavor
and
aroma
worked
together
well
together
im
keen
to
try
this
in
bottle
to
see
how
it
compares
to
what
i
had
on
tap
drinkability
at
a
relatively
low
6
7
abv
this
is
very
drinkable
the
gingerbread
component
may
get
to
be
too
much
for
some
so
beware
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
but
well
carbonated
other
than
looking
great
in
a
glass
that
is
about
this
entire
brew
has
going
for
itself
try
if
you
must
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
just
simply
feels
like
acid
to
the
mouth
this
is
totally
undrinkable
i
sat
through
about
a
half
hour
of
beer
torture
hoping
it
would
get
better
as
it
warmed
do
not
buy
this
nasty
acidic
beer
your
money
will
better
be
spent
on
almost
anything
else
man
this
beer
is
crap
in
short
half
of
a
bomber
is
all
i
can
gag
down
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
a
couple
750
ml
bottles
poured
as
a
nightcapper
with
some
friends
it
went
across
well
with
the
group
although
i
was
a
bit
less
impressed
i
have
to
say
the
smell
was
weak
and
the
taste
followed
suit
nice
overall
appearance
and
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
in
the
end
its
not
something
ill
pursue
nothing
to
sneeze
at
but
i
dont
find
it
to
be
life
altering
the
taste
started
out
a
little
thin
and
eventually
solidified
into
a
warm
satisfying
beer
the
malt
was
bready
and
slightly
toasty
the
yeast
gave
it
some
interesting
floral
and
sour
edges
and
the
body
eventually
worked
to
a
full
but
not
filling
drink
despite
the
large
bottle
it
drank
very
well
and
was
an
excellent
desert
grotten
pours
a
satisfying
maple
color
with
a
large
fluffy
shockingly
white
head
excellent
retention
smells
yeasty
and
dusty
with
some
esterclove
characteristics
reminiscent
of
a
hefeweizen
tastes
pretty
fruitylemon
is
prominentand
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppiness
in
the
finish
tastes
better
as
it
warms
i
thought
i
detected
some
phenol
when
at
first
but
no
longer
mouthfeel
has
a
luxuriant
frothiness
grotten
basically
tastes
like
a
bigger
version
of
a
hefeweizen
to
me
a
good
drinkable
beer
and
my
first
cave
aged
beer
a
tasty
pleasing
brew
here
but
i
expected
a
more
intense
flavors
from
this
one
a
recommended
experience
but
this
is
surpassed
by
quiet
a
few
other
belgian
beers
not
to
mention
ommegang
is
better
too
this
would
be
a
good
beer

very

cave
beer
i
dont
know
really
it
feels
like
just
another
brown
ale
from
belgium
nothing
is
wrong
but
not
really
special
either
this
beer
has
way
too
much
carbonation
it
almost
hurt
to
drink
the
beer
poured
a
murky
reddish
brown
with
an
impressive
long
lasting
head
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
you
did
catch
some
notes
of
candy
sugar
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
character
i
really
couldnt
taste
much
past
the
carbonation
as
i
removed
the
cage
from
this
one
the
cork
shot
right
out
with
a
loud
pop
and
i
expected
it
to
gush
which
it
did
not
poured
a
rich
clear
crimsion
red
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
sustained
itself
through
the
entire
beer
leaving
thick
belgian
lace
on
my
glass
the
aroma
was
very
dry
and
mild
for
a
belgian
dark
ale
lacking
all
of
the
plumb
and
dark
fruitiness
i
expected
the
taste
is
also
very
dry
and
i
think
that
it
was
aged
too
long
or
that
the
final
gravity
was
too
low
to
sustain
itself
through
the
maturation
process
there
is
a
sharp
bite
of
hops
in
the
beginning
which
carries
itself
through
the
entire
beer
making
it
onesided
yet
it
finishes
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
full
yet
it
has
a
sharp
carbonic
bite
that
lends
a
bit
more
to
the
dryness
rather
than
giving
relief
and
structure
to
the
malt
sweetness
the
drinkability
is
low
on
this
one
as
the
price
is
prohibitively
expensive
and
the
beer
dosent
make
up
for
the
cost
making
this
a
one
time
buy
for
me
it
does
have
a
pretty
bottle
though
i
dont
drink
beer
for
the
label
art
the
body
is
full
and
very
smooth
and
creamy
chewy
this
is
a
very
highly
drinkable
beer
as
i
said
earlier
its
a
more
easily
sessionable
version
of
abt
12
opinion
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
and
it
was
no
wonder
why
michael
jackson
raved
about
it
the
flavor
is
passive
enough
to
slip
past
the
palate
of
the
typical
swill
drinker
while
there
is
plenty
of
underlying
complexity
to
challenge
even
the
most
seasoned
palate
reading
the
style
guidelines
i
dont
see
that
this
beer
is
supposed
to
have
a
sour
component
but
the
example
that
i
am
drinking
certainly
has
a
sour
presence
it
is
by
far
not
a
big
enough
part
of
the
profile
to
suggest
that
this
beer
be
in
an
oud
bruin
category
but
it
is
something
to
be
noted
and
the
reason
for
some
of
my
scores
being
4s
this
particular
example
may
have
caught
something
but
in
my
opinion
it
helped
reading
the
literature
on
this
beer
one
would
think
that
it
would
be
really
consistent
from
bottle
to
bottle
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
know
what
this
beer
has
been
through
to
get
to
my
glass
regardless
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
i
will
certainly
try
it
again
when
the
opportunity
arises
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
dirty
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
ive
never
smelled
a
beer
quite
like
this
before
but
it
is
nice
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
for
a
brew
this
dark
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
its
not
a
beer
that
i
would
want
to
have
everyday
but
it
is
an
interesting
occasional
choice
hmm
i
forgot
to
mention
the
wonderful
head
retention
of
this
beer
i
should
also
mention
that
i
paid
only
7
50
for
this
beer
well
ive
finished
this
bottle
already
far
too
fast
that
i
would
judge
is
a
drinkable
beer
try
some
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
the
beautiful
bottle
pours
a
nice
deep
caramel
color
just
off
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
that
holds
well
and
laces
beautifully
smells
real
good
sweet
on
top
but
you
can
feel
the
malt
no
real
hop
to
speak
of
but
i
wasnt
expecting
any
the
malt
smell
follows
throught
in
the
taste
front
to
back
the
sweetness
of
the
aroma
is
not

light
and
flavorthin
beer
drinkability
interesting
at
that
but
the
dryness
and
its
unbalanced
nature
doesnt
do
it
for
me
this
beer
is
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
that
never
goes
away
thin
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
consists
of
yeast
spices
and
some
banana
mediumbodied
with
flavors
of
fruit
cherry
mostly
yeast
spices
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavor
falls
off
a
bit
and
it
would
have
been
a

better
with
more
malt
flavor
the
finish
is
vinous
and
somewhat
bitter
all
in
all
a
pretty
good

a
sufficient
and
deep
malty
flavor
is

with

taste

definitely
a

the

is
very
dry
and
again
herbal
i
think
this
beer
is
definitely
better
when
paired
with
food
than
on
its
own
it
seems
that
with
all
of
the
herbal

that
this
offering
could
be
considered
a
gruit
all

a
nice

from

definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
oh
well
the
aggressive

and

make
it
hard
for

to

much

its

i
have
to

im

the

was

nothing

about

well

with

the

me
wonder

the
aroma
was
almost
nil
nothing
there
flavor
was
malty
and
sweet
with
a
strange
tartness
on
the
finish
somewhat
thin
bodied
but
very
well
done
not
as
malty
as
i
expected
but
slighly
spicy
easy
to
drink
id
have
this
one
again
pours
with
a
dark

and
and
a
clean

the
nose
is
very
sweet
with
notes
of

scents
the
flavor
is
full
with
dark

malts
raisin
and
a
bit
of

bitterness
up

theres
a
nice
balance
of
tartness
and
sweetness
to
balance
the
light

of
the

a

a

slight

on

like
a

beer
i
dont
know
how
else
to
describe
it
a
musty
and
malty
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
head
and
good
lacing
the
taste
was
yeasty
with
sweet
but
tart
fruit
flavors
a
slightly
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
milky
finish
good
and
complex
but
didnt
bowl
me
over
for
some
reason
maybe
this
yeast
strain
just
doesnt
agree
with
me
huge
billow
of
head
to
start
that
laces
and
clings
on
its
way
down
deep
dark
brown
hue
to
the
point
of
mud
with
just
a
touch
of
blood
red
where
bulb
meets
stem
nose
held
a
kind
of
sweet
malt
and
frankly
somewhat
chummy
fruit
flavor
but
that
was
just
a
side
note
to
the
overall
malt
profile
that
dominated
very
fast
on
the
tongue
and
quietly
dissipating
mouthfeel
ablebodied
malt
structure
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
that
again
evaporates
like
a
heat
mirage
on
a
hot
pavement
this
is
one
that
i
could
drink
until
told
i
must
stop
once
uncaged
the
cork
came
loose
with
a
tug
and
a
satisfying

bountiful
aroma
is
belgianish
spicy
with
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
effervescence
present
taste
is
initially
lightly
of
dark
fruits
with
a
rounding
out
of
belgian
malt
and
yeast
flavors
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
are
both
very
good
an
enjoyable
brew
worth
both
trying
and
revisiting
75

a

subsided
into
a
thick
collar

some
nice
lacing
malty
doughy
and
yeasty
nose
with
a
slight
presence
of
citrus
zest
barley
husk
and
maybe
apple
skin
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
dry
finish
quite
atypical
of
a
finish
for
a
brown
lots
of
earthy
husky
malt
notes
amidst
a
solid
yeast
character
an
air
of
fruitiness
and
again
the
wonderfully
dry
finish
faint
spicing

suggested
sweetness
is
present
in
the
beer
just
kept
to
a
minimum
carbonation
is
rather
high
but
the
carbonic
acid
complements
the
dryness
in
the
finish
good
to
the
very
end
a
fantastically
wellrounded
beer
thats
not
too
cloying
or
overbearing
as
some
brown
ales
from
belgium
can
be
cave
aging
plays
an
integral
part
in

pretty

flavor

grain
bread
with
a
mild
citrusy
hop
bite
to
finish
a
well
balanced
brew
but
too
mild
in
the
flavor
department
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
call
this
an
extreme
beer
the
dryness
displayed
by
this
beer
was
amazing
no
sweetness
to
speak
of
which
is
quite
amazing
considering
the
alcohol
strength
and
malt
flavors
loads
of
complexity
here
main
flavor
is
bitter
orange
peel
but
theres
more
tarty
citric
flavors
the
bitterness
and
tartness
are
really
soft
a
peppery
spice
is
there
as
well
as
more
spices
that
were
unique
to
me
strong
hits
of
yeast
midway
through
and
then
in
the
finish
a
solid
beer
but
almost
too
much
to
me
i
have
to
give
respect
to
the
brewers
here
but
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
very
very
nice
deep
ruby

could
see
enjoying
this
one
all
night
it
was
really
quite
nice
as
it
warmed
in
the
bottle
damn
sure
worth
checking
out
this
isnt
as
complex
as
many
of
belgians
dark
beers
that
one
finds
in
the
state
but
its
interesting
and
highly
drinkable
i
hope
itll
become
available
in
texas
its
good
to
have
pierre
celis
brewing
skill
back
this
is
a
complex
yet
odd
beer
it
held
alot
of
promise
with
the
nice
aroma
and
the
initial
sour
zip
but
i
kept
wanting
more
tartness
this
beer
is
schizophrenic
the
1st
half
is
a
completely
different
beast
than
the
2nd
half
there
is
little
continuity
until
it
warms
as
it
warms
it
really
unfolds
and
nearly
meets
my
lofty
expectations
reminds
me
of
goudenband
mixed
3070
with
a
decent
abbey
single
poured
over
a
fresh
tropical
fruit
cocktail
unique
and
very
good
worth
the
10
i
paid
for
it
almost
dry
and
medicinal
throughout
with
notes
of
dark
fruits
nuts
and
cinnamon
and
a
suggestion
of
cellar
mustiness
as
well
it
pours
an
impressive
creamy
plentiful
head
which
dissipated
quickly
to
me
the
aroma
is
a
true
beer
smell
but
tastes
nothing
like
it
smells
i
think
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
black
and
tan
it
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
i
barely
tasted
the
alcohol
in
it
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
id
love
to
try
it
on

that

drinkability
a
decent
unique
belgian
bier
but
i
cant
give
it
the
highest
marks
it
just
seems
pretty
good
to
me
ng
this
beer
poured
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
bubbly
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
the
aroma
was
of
malt
cinnamon
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
spices
the
finish
was
fairly
light
and
sprite
compared
to
the
other
from
this
brewer
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
but
it
had
a
lot
to
live
up
to
it
is
a
servicable
brew
just
not
outstanding

750

the
beer
pours

the
smell
has
traces
of
ripe
fruit
and
just
a
bit

tartness
but
nothing
really
outstanding
the
same
holds
true
in
the
taste
interesting
fruit
flavors
with
a
slight
sour
note
but
nothing
particularly
noteworthy
for
some
reason
i
was
reminded
of
a
piece
of
fruitflavored
chewing
gum
that
had
been
chewed
too
long
leaving
little
of
the
original
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
it
goes
down
well
its
just
not
one
worth
searching
out
when
the
world
is
full
of
so
many
outstanding
belgian
strong
dark
ales
id
buy
several
others
before
this
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
decent
enough
i
was
not
impressed
enough
that
i
would
seek
out
this
beer
again
and
was
certainly
not
left
desiring
more
its
a
good
beer

not

for
a
750ml

the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
as
the

seemed
to
ride
the
tongue
well
into
the
aftertaste
carbonation
levels
were
light
nicely
drinkable
overall
the
presentation
of
the
bottle
and
the
caveaged
hype
all
fooled
me
into
thinking
that
this
would
be
something
special
sadly
it
wasnt
not
that
bad
but
really
just
above
average
but
given
its
background
hype
and
price
it
was
a
big
disappointment
think
hard
before
dropping
your
money
on
this
one
this
was
not
done
any
favors
by
the
cave
bleh
overall
impression
tried
this
beer
for
the
first
time
at
the
belgian
beer
weekend
2003
and
i
was
quite
impressed
with
it
it
seemed
to
be
somewhat
of
a
sleeper
hit
at
the
festival
not
a
lot
of
it
on
hand
but
it
was
gone
by
the
end
of
the
weekend
when
word
had
gotten
around
great
beer
with
a
lot
of
subtle
things
going
on
nice
tasteful
label
too
another
masterpiece
from
pierre
celis
there
is
a
great
spicy
phenolic
and
hoppy
aroma
the
body
is
reamy
and
rich
and
yet
lean
at
the
same
time
i
find
it
elegant
to
drink
it
finishes
spicy
and
left
me
wanting
a
lot
more
a
wonderful
beer
to
savor
and
it
is
not
as
bad
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
because
it
is
not
as
high
in
alcohol
as
many
other
belgians
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
amazing
the
yeast
and
malts
are
just
huge
even
when
cold
which
is
what
struck
me
in
my
initial
review
the
flavors
are
complex
and
explosive
and
the
carbonation
was
much
bigger
in
this
latest
example
im
upping
all
my
ratings
to
4
5s
and
considering
that
reserved
ruddy
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
taupehued
crown
lavish
rings
of
lace
remain
on
the
glass
spicy
aromas

traces
of
spiced
citrus
pepper
and
cinnamon
some
malty
caramel
sweetness
penetrates
as
well
spicy
fruity
flavors
reminiscent
of
the
detected
aromas
permeate
the
palate
en
route
to
a
mildly
astringent
dry
finish
wellcarbonated
moderately
bodied
and
a
rather
light
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
leads
to
good
drinkability
in
this
fullflavored
belgian
brown
very
good
though
it
failed
to
exceed
my
expectations

yeasty
slightly

lots

this
is

to
a

candy
sugar
are
all
interwoven
and
doing
what
they
do
best
on

theres
a
long
finish
with
this
beer
not
the
most
outstanding
belgian
ive
had
but
quite
high
on
the
list
a
bold
beer
a
brown
brew
as
would
be
expected
and
topped
with
an
offcreme
colored
head
which
settles
to
thin
lacing
after
a
couple
of
minutes
kind
of
a
bakery
frosting
sweetness
in
the
aroma
and
that
st
bernardus
candy
sugar
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
and
and
a
hint
of
hops
not
as
complex
as
id
expected
but
still
a
nice
aroma
the
flavors
are
also
not
as
complex
as
id
expected
but
its
still
a
tasty
beer
cinnamon
notes
are
easy
to
pick
up
its
almost
as
if
this
was
actually
brewed
with
cinnamon
good
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
candy
sugar
make
up
the
sweetness
and
hops
sting
at
the
tongue
with
a
slight
peppery
flavor
and
the
help
of
the
carbonation
which
is
like
a
thick
layer
of
small
bubbles
on
the
tongue
as
is
usual
with
this
style
a
little
less
thick
and
chewy
than
i
like
for
this
style
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
an
enjoyable
one
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
pick
of
the
year
pours
a
really
nice
deep
chestnut
color
a
soft
pillowy
head
forms
subsides
and
can
be
easily
coaxed
back
into
action
with
a
slight
swirl
the
lace
is
minimal
yet
again
with
some
coaxing
aromas
are
deep
and
warming
with
banana
and
spice
up
front
with
a
mild
and
very
pleasant
sweetness
drawing
one
in
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
exciting
with
cleansing
carbonation
the
taste
is
complex
and
displays
some
of
the
qualities
i
find
in
the
trappistes
rochefort
stuffespecially
the
blue
cheesy
like
flavor
again
flavors
of
ripe
banana
surface
an
intense
bitter
chocolate
like
quality
emerges
also
traces
of
roasted
coffee
linger
and
ripe
cave
aged
blue
cheese
flavors
return
with
a
passion
this
is
very
much
like
a
low
octane
trappist
brew
in
my
opinion
quite
tasty
but
certainly
not
my
choice
for
beer
of
the
year
id
love
to
pair
this
with
a
blue
cheese
crusted
tenderloin
and
a
side
of
pomme
frites

pierre

signature
selection
and
michael
jacksons
beer
of
the
year
quite
a
heavily
hyped
brew
but
does
it
deliver
the
pour
yields
a
dark
brown
burgundian
brew
in
my
chalice
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
of
foam
the
aromas
are
very
strong
and
consists
of
molasses
cloves
bananas
and
other
fruits
belgian
candy
sugar
belgian
malts
hops
and
yeast
the
taste
is
quite
yeasty
very
fruity
amazingly
dry
and
quite
complex
but
not
as
complex
as
the
aromas
would
make
you
believe
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
nice
a
nice
beer
but
not
worth
the
9
i
paid
for
it
a
pity
that
the
initial
promise
did
not
deliver
any
greater
complexities
but
its
a
nice
enough
beverage
as
it
is
just
nothing
too
terrific
nice
enjoyable
drinkability
i
could
easily
consume
1500

in
a

any
fan
of
st
bernardus
beers
especially
prior

needs
to
seek
this
one
out
wonderful
beer
very
smooth
brew
somehow
this
beer
feels
sweet
but
its
remarkably
dry
molasses
cloves
and
doughy
bread
are
the
backbone
here
with
touches
of
the
spiciness
hinted
at
by
the
nose
straightforward
and
simple
but
remarkably
well
integrated
i
mean
this
thing
tastes
like
its
a
natural
liquid
of
the
earth
light
hop
finish
alcohol
presence
dominates
as
it
sits
out
and
warms
superbly
drinkable
aroma
is
mostly
yeasty
covering
realms
of
clove
pepper
and
cinnamon
musty
bread
touch
of
citrus
and
banana
underlaying
tones
of
malty
sweetness
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
nice
strength
of
one
dimensional
flavor
with
yeast
that
has
some
light
notions
of
clove
pepper
musty
bread
and
a
backing
of
sweet
semisugary
malts
not
all
that
complex
or
layered
but
a
favorable
sweetness
and
yeastyness
holds
for
a
good
time
with
a
medium
body
and
a
somewhat
weak
finish
that
has
a
very
light
nutty
dryness
a
fine
drinkable
belgian
ale
but
nothing
to
keep
on
the
shelf
for
to
long
drinkability
pretty
decent
but
there
are
definitely
better
beers
out
there
in

this

alcoholic

and

well
carbonated
medium
to
full
smooth
with
an
acidic
dry
finish
not
having
any
expectations
of
this
beer
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
would
drink
another
bottle
of
this
anytime
the
beer
pours
from
the
750ml
corked
bottle
with
a
rich
and
full
sound
the
color
a
lightly
hazed
deep
orange
tinted
copper
the
head
is
brontosaurian
in
size
the
texture
semi
creamy
and
the
color
a
beauteous
light
tan
with
the
lace
a
firm
sheet
to
conceal
the

of

and
a
hit
of

the

the

acidic
hops
are
basal

spicy
enough
to
make
me
notice
aftertaste
vinous
dry
and
long
lasting
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
than
it
gave
me
nonetheless
a
decent
drinking
beer
but
certainly
not
anything
to
get
excited
about
this
beer
appears
brown
with
reddish
notes
when
held
up
to
the
light
quite
cloudy
pours
with
a
lively
carbonation
that
creates
a
beige
head
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
along
with
a
mustiness
and
a
bit
of
a
sour
aroma
a
definite
sour
taste
in
this
one
but
only
lightly
so
definite
belgian
character
in
this
beer
musty
fruity
and
slightly
funky
a
tart
cherry
flavor
is
here
as
well
fairly
dry
a
slight
pepperiness
and
a
general
spiciness
to
this
brew
fairly
complex
even
has
a
slight

note
to
it
dark
murky
brown
with
nice
head
yet
lacing
is
sparse
spicy
aroma
with
notes
of

i
definitely
get
the
wheat

similarity
that
another
rated
mentions
lively
mouthfeel
that
dances
the
labamba
on
your
tongue
interesting
blend
of
flavors
here
and
not
one
thing
dominating
fruity
malty
spicy
earthy
and
yeasty
all
at

another
fine
brew
from
st
bs
thanks
to
david
at
anam
cara
for
this
one
the
bottle
and
concept
was
more
impressive
than
the
beer
another
beer
specialty
enjoyed
with
my
fellow
bas
lovely
cognac
color
when
poured
cinnamon
aroma
this
was
cave
aged
give
me
more
cave
aged
beer
the
cinnamon
was
also
predominant
in
the
taste
which
i
also
found
slightly
tart
and
dry
glad
to
have
been
around
when
this
was
being
poured
pat
notes
solid
beer
very
drinkable
the
flavors
seem
deep
with
hidden
characteristics
that
would
be
fun
to
search
for
the
bubbles
in
the
head
are
simply
mesmerizing
and
they
lend
well
to
the
mouthfeel
served
way
too
cold
had
to
wait
about
20
minutes
until
it
was
warm
enough
to
taste
anything
the
flavour
is
quite
subtle
and
soft
something
about
it
was
quite
softdrinky
had
some
nice
bitter
slightly
acidic
characters
towards
the
end
quite
soft
and
smooth
aswell
with
some
light
spicyness
originally
sampled
from
bottle
11
march
2002
grottenbier
bruin
has
a
good
mix
of
malt
dried
fruit
in
the
bouquet
on
the
palate
the
flavor
has
some
spicey
notes
as
well
grottenbier
bruin
is
quite
delicious
and
simply
another
winner
from
pierre
celis
the
body
is
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
good
creamy
white
head
it
has
a
very
spicy
nose
banana
and
cloves
mix
w
cinammon
and
buttercream
more
bananas
and
caramel
cream
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fuzzy
very
warm
relaxing
beer
reminds
me
of
bananas
foster
thanks
to
my
friend
belgianbum
for
this
treat
foam
wide
and
abundant
not
completely
compact
with
some
big
bubbles
maybe
due
to
the
glass
color
brown
with
mahogany
reflexes
smell
of
flowers
forgetmenot
periwinkle
etc
the
taste
is
round
not
too
dry
with
honey
well
balanced
it
needs
a
second
and
third
taste
a
solvent
like
note
perceptible
specially
in
the
flavour
when
the
beer
got
warm
m
its
full
bodied
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
have
thought
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
this
beer
not
sure
if
it
was
just
this
batch
but
it
seemed
to
lack
concentration
and
intensity
while
its
in
a
belgian
style
it
doesnt
have
nearly
the
punch
of
a
true
belgian
served
in
a
10
oz
snifter
with
little
head
nose
is
bourbon
vanilla
oak
and
not
much
else
taste
is
a
nice
mellow
bourbon
with
the
typical
vanilla
and
oak
but
thats
about
it
a
little
on
the
boring
side
but
still
it
is
nice
to
see
brewpubs
making
bourbon
aged
brews
and
it
hits
the
spot
nicely
the
taste
is
bourbon
dominated
but
thats
about
it
the
base
beer
seems
bland
and
the
barrel
flavors
are
a
bit
muted
not
nearly
the
match
of
the
nose
at
times
this
seems
watery
but
the
carbonation
is
good
all
of
these
combined
make
it
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
offering
drinkability
this
beer
is
not
as
loud
and
extreme
as
the
style
and
barrel
aging
would
suggest
it
is
a
very
delciate
take
on
the
style
making
it
quite
drinkable
md
medium
thick
mouthfeel
but
creamy
and
a
little
slick
very
drinkable
not
overly
sweet
at
all
highly
recommended
drinkabilty
definitely
get
again
when
i
am
in
the
mod
for
a
flavorful
beer
i
have
tried
this
before
but
never
reviewed
it
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
oak
and
bourbon
just
what
i
look
for
in
a
bourbonbarrel
aged
beer
the
flavor
is
vanilla
brown
sugar
oak
bourbon
and
some
roasted
malts
low
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
edit
tried
again
111
bourbonness
that
i
loved
so
much
in
the
original
is
all
but
a
ghost
of
its
former
self
for
shame
review
adjusted
accordingly
poured
a
deep
dark
orangeamber
almost
brown
color
wtih
an
averaged
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
strong
woodyoakiness
earthy
roasty
with
light
chocolate
and
a
trace
of
bourbon
the
earthywoodiness
definitely
dominates
the
aromas
tastes
of
vanilla
whisky
more
than
the
aromas
caramel
lighter
roast
and
vanilla
body
a
bit
on
the
thinner
side
very
thin
body
but
the
carbonation
really
picks
this
one
up
as
it
is
very
smooth
and
airy
on
the
palate
somewhat
of
a
dry
finish
very
clean
i
wonder
if
there
are
any
beer
flavored
bourbons
d
good
much
better
than
the
first
time
i
had
this
more
complex
flavor
almost
opaque
black
pour
in
a
tulip
on
draft
color
of
black
licorice
after
you
bite
into
it
with
shades
of
chalky
dark
brown
to
black
smell
isnt
overly
strong
but
is
quite
inviting
and
nice
subtle
deep
roasty
malt
some
bourbon
as
well
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
rich
licorice
like
roasty
malt
and
a
nice
hit
of
bourbon
flavor
without
the
boozy
hot
feel
better
than
the
okanogan
schwarzbier
itself
and
the
barrel
aging
adds
some
nice
complementing
character
to
this
beer
id
recommend
this
and
im
not
a
regularly
a
schwarzbier
fan
this
was
an
excellent
beer
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
many
of
the
beers
from
sweetwater
and
this
is
one
of
them
well
crafted
more
to
be
desired
though
poured
a
dark
redbrown
with
very
little
head
very
nice
aroma
with
a
smooth
taste
and
feel
2

no
idea
what
this
beer
will
catch
it
certainly
didnt
reel
me
in
not
sure
i
see
where
the
belgian
is
in
here
looks
good
nice
aroma
taste
was
rather
sweet
usually
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
these
domestic
belgian
types
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
its
got
a
lot
of
grain
to
it
body
and
toasted
red
malts
caramel
nuttiness
but
its
not
at
all
sweet
the
yeast
does
a
great
job
of
cleaning
that
up
fruity
from
the
yeast
but
not
bubblegum
its
more
pears
and
citrus
which
help
to
lighten
it
its
also
real
well
carbonated
and
refreshing
as
a
result
definitely
a
little
something
different
here
not
my
favorite
from
these
guys
but
absolutely
better
than
its
ratings
on
here
not
in
love
with
the
yeast
strain
but
the
beer
tastes
pretty
good
on
the
whole
3

overall
pass
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
ok
in
a
pinch
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
thought
this
was
a
lot
better
than
the
score
would
suggest
nice
overall
belgian
character
nothing
fantastic
but
still
pretty
well
done
one
of
the
better
sweetwater
offerings
ive
had
compare
it
to
some
of
the
beers
in
its
style
and
it
does
quite
well
im
a
sweetwater
fan
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
not
the
best
mix
of
malt
and
hops
flavor
had
this
on
draft
and
enjoyed
it
it
is
smooth
like
a
killians
with
a
bit
of
a
spice
finish
nice
taste
not
a
big
fan
of
hefty
winter
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
wets
the
whistle
well
at
6
abv
i
compare
it
to
ghost
river
riverbank
red
here
in
memphis
flavor
reveals
pear
skin
bitterness
and
floral
notes
with
toasted
malt
at
the
base
the
finish
is
slightly
spicy
theres
a
woody
bitter
character
that
pervades
in
the
aftertaste
with
the
malty
sweetness
swiftly
trailing
the
spices
and
grain
stand
tall
boosted
with
the
high
bubbly
nature
of
the
beer
the
mediumbodied
ale
takes
on
the
slim
tang
of
rose
wine
but
with
the
nutty
and
spicy
aftertaste
of
belgian
dubbel
overall
this
one
is
a
miss
from
sweetwater
it
is
a
decent
attempt
but
it
just
misses
the
mark
for
me
this
seems
a
nicely
unique
ale
and
to
my
mind
it
is
really
unlike
other
sweetwater
brews
the
beautiful
red
has
a
big
malty
and
fruity
nose
with
a
hint
of
spice
but
it
doesnt
taste
fruity
it
is
unique
in
that
it
has
the
big
sweet
malty
character
of
a
belgianstyle
but
somehow
at
the
very
same
time
has
a
crisp
hopiness
both
are
present
throughout
there
is
a
surprise
lingering
hop
character
that
is
a
bit
like
an
ipa
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
a
second
time
this
could
be
my
new
favorite
from
this
brewery
overall
i
am
definitely
not
feeling
this
one
not
really
bad
but
i
just
didnt
like
it
at
all
good

bad

as
politely
as
i
can
let
me
say
this

im
a
huge
sweetwater
fan
and
i
thought
the
beer
was
ok
clear
chestnut
color
with
a
small
creamy
head
belgian
yeast
aromas
mostly
clove
bubblegum
and
a
little
cherry
along
with
some
nutty
malts
flavor
is
a
spicier
and
rougher
peppercorns
light
candy
sugar
dried
flowers
and
earthiness
very
raw
and
yeasty
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
texture
not
good
overall
a
really
good
beer
this
beer
is
a
good
one
to
go
to
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
those
traditional
yeast
notes
that
you
may
associate
with
a
hefeweizen
o
this
brew
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
with
turning
the
heat
up
a
bit
nothing
stands
out
here
the
body
of
the
beer
was
clear
and
a
shade
of
orangebrown
i
can
describe
as
auburn
the
head
was
relatively
modest
estimated
at
one
finger
thick
the
aroma
displayed
the
unmistakable
spicy
sweet
signature
of
belgian
yeast
this
smelled
like
cherries
white
pepper
orange
zest
and
coriander
the
taste
was
fruity
and
spicy
with
flavors
of
apple
banana
pear
clove
saffron
naval
orange
and
some
toffee
were
present
the
finish
was
very
dry
and
quite
floral
there
was
a
good
deal
of
complexity
in
the
taste
but
the
body
was
quite
thin
and
i
wish
there
was
more
heft
present
here
the
aftertaste
was
spicy
but
faded
quickly
easy
to
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
winter
night
but
you
are
going
to
need
more
than
one
if
you
want
it
to
keep
you
warm
at
night
mouthfeel
hop
bitterness
comes
on
pretty
strong
as
a
harsh
lingering
earthy
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
pours
a
reddish
black
with
a
finger
of
bubbly
white
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
typical
of
a
belgian
with
esters
and
clovex
present
the
taste
is
initially
similar
but
theres
definitely
a
smokiness
there
mediumlight
mouth
and
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
nice
crispness
not
a
bad
little
brew
pours
deep
dark
crimson
with
a
creamy
head
smells
bitter
and
sour
almost
like
olives
tastes
bitter
and
spiced
with
a
malty
character
as
well
normal
mouthfeel
and
wet
finish
great
black
ale
nice
and
sweet
but
chocolatey
and
slightly
smokey
but
lighter
than
a
stout
the
dry
finish
makes
it
feel
like
im
drinking
a
beer
instead
of
eating
a
cake
pours
pitch
black
with
a
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
decent
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
mentholatum
kind
of
odd
for
a
beer
much
less
a
dark
beer
has
a
smokey
bbq
taste
but
not
on
the
strong
side
very
little
bitterness
is
involved
its
named
perfectly
because
it
pours
completely
opaque
black
the
aroma
is
not
as
overpowering
as
a
rhino
however
i
pick
up
a
subtle
roasty
malt
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
the
taste
mirrors
this
but
adds
in
a
bit
of
coffee
a
very
creamy
ale
with
a
toasty
aftertaste
very
sessionable
good
schtuff
and
im
not
only
saying
this
because
ive
had
a
glass
or
two
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
erich
o
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
this
one
because
i
love
dark
ales
and
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
had
was
a
belgian
black
ale
back
in
2006
alas
this
one
just
did
not
hit
the
spot
overall
the
beer
is
extremely
good
and
rather
enjoyable
i
highly
recommend
it
and
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
not
the
best
darkstyle
ive
tried
but
its
got
its
own
quirky
appeal
i
recommend
it
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
that
wont
strangle
your
taste
buds
but
will
still
stand
out
a
little
unique
without
blowing
your
mind
pours
out
a
nice
dark
brown
color
almost
black
in
appearance
its
topped
off
with
a
semidark
tan
head
thats
bubbly
and
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
ring
of
lacing
with
an
island
of
bubbles
in
the
middle
floral
and
fruity
aromas
are
present
some
spiced
apples
and
mild
fig
smells
too
this
is
a
very
bitter
ale
at
first
good
roasted
coffee
flavors
do
come
through
the
spices
and
fruits
take
a
back
seat
and
are
detectable
it
is
dry
and
lighttomedium
bodied
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
the
bitterness
calms
down
the
roasted
coffee
mellows
out
and
the
spice
comes
through
a
bit
more
the
bitterness
calms
down
as
the
ale
warms
up
overall
not
a
bad
beer
o
not
the
best
darkstyle
ive
tried
but
its
got
its
own
quirky
appeal
i
recommend
it
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
that
wont
strangle
your
taste
buds
but
will
still
stand
out
a
little
unique
without
blowing
your
mind
on
draft
at
slaters
5050
in
pasadena
really
thin
and
medicinal
it
tasted
like
what
a
bandaid
smells
like
will
have
to
try
again
some
other
time
and
hopefully
rescore
a
pleasant
mouthful
of
flavor

opaque

is
of
dark
roasted

and
cocoa
taste
is
much
the

with
a
vanilla
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
vanilla
aromas
and
flavors
seem
slightly
artificial
overall
this
is
a
unique
brew
that
puts
an
interesting
twist
on
the
belgianstyle
ale
the
balance
and
complexity
are
there
and
im
a
sucker
for
the
belgian
yeast
and
mouthfeel
im
not
usually
very
keen
on
rye
beers
but
this
one
is
tastefully
done
in
a
way
that
adds
nuance
without
being
gimmicky

this

on

at

off

pretty
tasty
beer
no
complaints
i
noticed
the
beeradvocate
community
tends
to
give
this
style
of
beer
a
rating
that
never
really
approaches
4
for
the
average
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
for
the
style

with

sip
this
beer
has
a

with
a
slightly
crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
for
the
style
i
had
this
beer
at
societe
on
a
recent
trip
to
san
diego
the
beer
arrives
with
a
dark
copper
color
and
generous
head
aromas
of
yeast
and
bread
dominate
the
nose
the
flavor
is
a
little
white
peppery
with
very
little
if
any
phenolic
clovey
flavors
a
good
thing
imo
very
drinkable
but
not
one
of
societes
more
exciting
beers
decent
but
lacking
simply
and
straight
up
decent
but
lacking
belgian
yeasty
flavors
along
with
some
mango
and
pineapple
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
perfumey
hint
to
finish
thoroughly
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
beer

also
had
a

it
settled
down
soon
to
a
nice
light
thin
cover
some

a
dark

a

technically
good

esthetically
not
so
much
this
i
like
this
i
like
a
lot
cheeky
here
from

with
an
abv
of
666
i
mean
nice
guys
the
beer
is
cool
but
i
think
its
the
lesser
of
the
two
still
neat
to
try
them
side
by
side
this
isnt
all
that
dark
somewhat
of
a
brown
ale
look
to
it
nice
froth
and
excellent
carbonation
on
the
feel
the
nose
is
more
belgian
yeast
than
dark
malt
and
the
flavor
has
quite
a
bit
of
hops
to
it
sort
of
a
weird
in
between
as
far
as
styles
go
with
the
belgian
yeast
in
a
hoppy
darker
beer
unique
though
and
real
drinkable
with
just
a
subtle
dark
malt
flavor
to
go
with
the
bittering
hops
and
fruity
ester
heavy
yeast
seems
light
with
the
soda
pop
carbonation
but
something
is
weird
with
the
proportions
of
this
one
as
drinkable
as
it
is
i
liked
this
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
the
from
heaven
version
though
is
an
outstanding
belgian
pale
definitely
worthy
of
being
stocked
in
the
fridge

not

complex
as
i
had
hoped
overall
it
was
very
simple

straightforward

theres
nothing

that

of

although
im
not
sure
those
were
used
here
finish
is
herbal
almost
medicinal

i
enjoyed
the

but
it
left
a
bit
too
astringent
flavor
lingering
i
liked
the
same
herbal
flavors
in
the
heaven
better
but
hell
is
like
that
i
guess
kinda
grew
on
me
as

it

im

plenty

work
went

i
popped

almost
immediately
i
got
foam
coming
up
the
neck
and
quickly
running
down
the
side
of
the
bottle
i
placed
the
bottle
inside
the
glass
until
i
could
regroup
i
guess
that
i
am
lucky
that
it
was
not
an
outright
gusher
i
can
also
read
so
i
utilized
a
very
gentle
pour
and
only
filled
about
a
quarter
of
the
glass
before
allowing
it
to
rest
as
you
may
imagine
i
ended
up
with
two
fingers
of
frothy

fizzed

coffee
dark
chocolate
mustiness
and
even
vinousness
off
of
this
one
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
but
quite
effervescent
the
roasted
malt
was
the
clear
driver
in
this
beer
it
tasted
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
in
the
mouth
initially
but
warming
it
took
on
a
dried
dark
fruit
aspect
i
kept
thinking
of
a
cadbury
fruit
nut
bar
sans
the
nuttiness
finish
was
semidry
with
the
yeast
really
having
done
their
job
but
at
the
same
time
leaving
enough
sweetness
so
as
not
to
make
it
totally
dry
this
had
a
vinousness
that
was
interesting
but
kind
of
outside
of
my
scope
if
i
were
to
buy
another
bottle
i
might
allow
it
to
age

a
while

tasting

o
this
is
a
excellent
beer
well
balanced
mild
dark
flavors
it
just
goes
down
easy
awesome
aftertaste
o
this
beer
is
quite
complex
for
a
belgian
dark
ale
and
has
the
depth
of
flavors
you
would
expect
from
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
yet
it
is
easy
to
drink
because
it
doesnt
have
a
high
alcohol
content
a
good
beer
with
good
flavor
bottle
bought
in
march
poured
dark
brown
with
golden
as
opposed
to
red
undertones
and
a
thin
layer
of
ivory
head
that
remained
as
a
scrim
and
laced
the
glass
aromas
of
cherry
sawdust
a
sour
yeast
note
a
grassy
herbal
smell
toasted
caramel
malt
red
fruits
a
coriander
and
sour
note
just
a
bit
of
hop
spice
with
little
bitterness
nice
creamy
feel
but
with
a
clean
finish
coating
but
not
cloying
the
taste
is
a
caramel
chocolate
and
candi
sugar
this
reminds
of
chocolate
and
plums
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
the
yeast
adds
a
nice
belgian
fruitiness
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
i
wouldnt
recommend
because
there
are
better
examples
out
there
o
a
good
beer
without
being
great
scooter
from
hell
gotta
love
it
especially
with
that
stated
abv
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
very
dark
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
rye
bread
light
chocolate
light
clove
brown
sugar
and
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
spices
melding
very
well
with
the
cocoa
and
everything
fading
into
a
toast
haze
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
belgian
dark
one
that
balances
its
spice
load
with
its
grains
roastiness
pretty
well
i
cant
believe
navette
doesnt
get
more
love
here
very
nice
belgian
black
ale
tastes
delicious
and
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
o
really
nice
belgian
black
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
dark
black
body
with
an
off
white
head
chocolate
and
pine
on
the
nose
really
interesting
scent
that
leads
directly
to
the
flavor
light
roast
but
semi
sweet
chocolate
then
a
slight
piney
bitterness
the
key
to
this
black
ale
is
the
bitterness
is
very
much
in
check
the
roasted
malt
really
adds
a
semi
sweet
chocolate
rather
than
a
bitter
bakers
chocolate
or
a
coffee
roast
that
allows
the
hops
to
remain
part
of
the
flavor
profile
there
is
a
hint
of
citrus
rind
but
primarily
floral
pine
really
nicely
balanced
black
ale
akin
to
a
new
glarus
black
top
rather
than
some
of
the
overtly
roasty
or
dank
black
ales
out
there
very
good
flavor
the
only
one
of
their
beers
that
i
enjoyed
great
taste
i
will
drink
again
its
a
damn
brown
ale
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
dark
chocolate
almost
black
aromas
of
dark
fruit
like
dates
with
a
hint
of
coffee
light
and
slightly
creamy
definitely
taste
fruit
and
coffee
only
moderately
sweet
hidden
roasted
malts
very
drinkable
and
smooth
close
to
a
stout
good
year
around
but
think
it
will
do
better
in
the
winter
strangeways
is
known
for
their
adventurous
brewing
but
their
yearround
offerings
albino
monkey
witbier
and
woodbooger
dark
ale
are
consistent
delicious
and
very
very
drinkable
the
flavor
features
a
strong
coffee
element
its
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
suggests
although
i
do
get
some
cocoa
notes
i
also
note
some
sourness
in
the
background
short
aftertaste
the
body
is
thinner
than
i
would
like
and
the
high
carbonation
exacerbates
this
so
why
the
claim
to
be
something
else
o
billed
by
the
brewery
as
a
belgianstyle
brown
ale
rich
darkroast
malt
flavor
reminiscent
of
a
porter
interesting
combination
of
styles
and
very
drinkable
not
bad
tends
to
the
sweet
side
a
very
nice
dark
ale
a
style
which
is
rapidly
becoming
a
favorite
this
is
absolutely
delicious
and
just
sweet
enough
to
be
desirable
but
not
cloying
the
price
point
is
reasonable
the
only
negative
point
for
me
is
the
absolute
lack
of
head
and
lacing
soso
nothing
special
uninspired
looks
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
sweet
and
fruity
slight
offnotes
in
the
background
insipid
watery
body
no
great
shakes
though
i
expect
the
age
of
the
bottle
also
has
something
to
do
with
it
no
need
to
run
out
and
hunt
it
down
i
like
the
multicharachteristic
transitional
nature
of
this
beer
it
is
half
rich
and
sweet
have
bitter
and
harsh
the
key
is
the
point
of
transition
that
moment
is
why
i
liked
this
an
interesting
brew
that
is
worth
trying
i
also
disagree
with
some
posts
suggesting
food
with
this
youd
really
lose
aha
makes
this
good
the

on
the

for
a
short

good

but
were
not
as
robust
as
i
was
hoping
with
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
creamy
and
lightly
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
dark
ale
nice
flavor
balance
and
complexity
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
m
easy
drinking
somewhat
thin
for
mouthfeel
but
it
is
a
lower
abv
beer
after
popping
the
cap
there
is
a
gross
plug
of
yeast
stuck
to
the
underside
of
the
cap
and
around
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
chunks
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
and
settling
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
and
some
slight
soy
sauce
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
but
quite
watery
and
slightly
sour
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
seems
to
be
suffering
from
a
slight
infection
issue
perhaps
taste
is
a
great
mix
of
ripe
fruit
and
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
syrupy
but
not
overly
sweet
and
it
balanced
the
tartness
some
wood
is
shining
through
this
is
not
a
standard
belgian
dark
ale
with
the
complex
yeast
profile
and
proves
belgians
are
still
creative
o
this
beer
shares
a
lot
of
similarities
with
a
dubbel
except
that
it
is
a
little
lighterbodied
on
the
palate
and
doesnt
have
as
much
alcohol
content
there
is
some
sweetness
but
it
is
not
cloying
i
would
definitely
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
if
i
see
it
again
a
malty
yummy
beer
goes
very
well
with
robust
food
an
easydrinking
dark
ale
that
pairs
well
with
light
conversation
while
not
quite
a
sessionable
beer
if
one
takes
their
time
a
second
offering
would
be
welcome
overall
ok
but
i
was
expecting
more
overall
it
is
good
and
definitely
is
a
good
for
a
brown
ale
nothing
too
spectacular
definitely
drinkable
not
worth
the
price
i
let
this
warm
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
poured
with
a
nice
large
thick
foamy
frothy
fluffy
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
an
opaque
brown
with
a
little
red
and
lots
of
sediment
in
suspension
aroma
is
roast
cocoa
molasses
spice
yeast
flavors
almost
exactly
the
same
just
more
intense
plus
a
nice
balance
of
carbonic
tang
and
just
enough
sweetness
body
and
carbonation
are
good
beer
is
a
little
chewy
finish
is
of
average
length
and
satisfying
decent
beer
its
interesting
but
i
think
the
warning
was
deservedthis
feels
certainly
a
little
past
its
prime
although
the
base
characters
are
worthy
its
certainly
still
drinkable
at
this
age
dave
said
probably
two
years
but
id
love
to
try
it
young
as
well
o
i
generally
dont
care
for
the
lower
strength
belgian
dark
ales
but
this
one
quickly
grew
on
me
in
the
end
bink
bruin
is
just
a
pleasant
enjoyable
beer
that
is
sessionable
by
belgian
standards
sweet
smell
and
dito
taste
wher
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
well
made
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
reddish
brown
in
the
wine
glass
has
that
classic
candied
fruit
soup
taste
label
raves
about
bringing
hops
back
into
belgian
brewing
but
i
dont
think
this
will
win
friends
sweet
brown
sugar
flavor
with
a
touch
of
vermouth
it
does
have
some
bitterness
but
most
of
the
flavor
comes
from
the
murky
musty
funk
peculiar
fruitcake
smell
with
something
like
artificial
vanilla
if
this
is
an
authentic
and
historic
beer
i
bow
down
but
it
reminds
me
why
i
keep
vowing
not
to
drink
belgian
beers
outside
of
their
own
land
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
off
white
collar
aroma
is
very
malty
with
notes
of
dried
dates
prunes
and
raisen
all
pulling
through
in
the
taste
more
dark
fruits
a
chocolatey
maltyness
and
restrained
bitterness
very
much
in
the
dubbel
vein
but
alittle
lighter
in
abv
dark
fruits
abound
with
a
caramelized
sugary
maltyness
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
chewey
overall
a
tasty
little
beer
worth
revisiting
jd
malty
with
a
hint
of
roast
sometimes
described
as
a
scotch
but
less
bitter
than
i
would
expect
quite
smooth
neither
the
sweetness
nor
the
bitterness
are
overdone
striking
a
good
balance
it
is
a
creamy
brew
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
finish
is
pleasant
bitter
and
semi
sweet
coffee
d
very
drinkable
drinkability
darn
drinkable
couldnt
wait
to
pair
it
with
mussels
which
i
promptly
then
had
to
order
and
devour
even
though
i
had
just
finished
dinner
good
stuff
d
highly
drinkable
flavorful
and
refreshing
maybe
a
little
sweet
on
the
finish
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
on
these
on
a
summer
afternoon
d
really
good
this
beer
seems
to
be
having
an
identity
crisis
and
is
too
light
in
flavor
for
the
pricetag
perhaps
would
be
a
good
stepping
stone
into
the
realm
of
belgian
dark
ales
f
still
lightly
sweet
with
brown
sugar
some
rich
porter
malts
and
bitterness
lingering
the
spiciness
really
lingers
with
it
what
is
that
watch
out
for
that
last
bit
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
its
harsh
overall
this
is
far
from
being
undrinkable
but
it
seems
to
be
missing
a
certain
refinement
for
me
it
was
a
one
time
deal
hey
it
would
make
a
good
slogan
the
body
is
medium
with
the
finish
sharp
crisp
and
spicy
solid
brew
all
the
way
around
but
just
a
bit
woody
by
bottle
end
pours
brown
with
virtually
no
head
nose
is
soft
with
brown
sugar
baked
desserts
and
maybe
some
ginger
vanilla
palate
is
in
line
with
the
nose
rather
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
baked
goods
again
body
is
disappointingly
thin
and
finish
is
rather
muted
notes
from
62006
though
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
it
at
first
i
had
incredibly
high
expectations
i
had
after
trying
other
kerkom
brews
this
is
a
pretty
decent
drinkable
bruin
ale
bink
bruin
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
color
with
bright
highlights
and
rim
shine
it
sports
a
small
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
patches
while
it
thins
out
the
nose
is
classic
belgian
dubbel
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
subtle
notes
of
roasted
coffee
cream

cherry
its
flavor
is
rich
and
smooth
big
chocolate

toasted

brown

slight

and
maple
syrup
it
has
a
nice
medium
body
that
thickens
slightly
as
it
warms
very
bright
carbonation
like
root
beer
a
very
nice
beer
very
drinkable
not
bad
but
nothing
above
and
beyond
picked
this
brew
up
the
other
day
and
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
it
poured
to
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
smallish
medium
colored
tan
head
which
had
very
slight
retention
and
no
real
lacing
only
a
slight
sheen
at
the
top
of
the
glass
nose
has
a
nice
malt
scent
with
some
fruit
highlights
and
a
slight
alcohol
like
aroma
also
some
sour
aromas
come
out
which
seem
to
go
together
quite
nicely
with
the
malt
the
taste
is
also
quite
nice
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
thought
nice
malt
flavors
with
a
slight
sourness
that
is
so
ever
light
as
the
brew
warms
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
comes
out
mixed
with
some
dark
fruit
like
cherries
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
guess
i
was
expecting
it
to
have
a
little
more
to
it
but
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
and
seems
to
get
a
little
better
as
it
warms
closer
to
room
temp
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
one
i
would
get
again
i
have
to
echo
the
sentiments
of
the
last
reviewer
this
beer
is
very
one
dimensional
with
that
dimension
being
malt
sweetness
theres
enough
belgian
yeast
character
present
to
make
it
clear
that
youre
not
drinking
an
american
brew
but
beyond
that
not
much
to
speak
of
more
carbonation
in
my
bottle
at
least
wouldve
improved
the
mouthfeel
a
lot
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
the
beer
is
drinkable
enough
though
the
beer
sheet
at
caseys
indicated
the
abv
is
7
5
rather
then
the
5
5
noted
in
this
review
not
that
im
an
expert
but
based
on
what
i
tasted
tonight
the
7
5
seems
more
likely
pours
a
clean
clear
brown
a
slight
head
with
almost
no
carbonation
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
lightly
roasty
chocolate
flavor
continues
with
a
more
pronounced
hop
bite
as
suggested
on
the
label
the
brewer
has
determined
single
handedly
to
bring
real
hops
back
into
belgian
brewing
not
that
i
knew
this
was
a
problem
but
ok
for
me
these
dark
ales
are
more
about
malt
and
yeast
and
complex
flavors
derived
therein
not
hops
its
decent
enough
but
does
not
really
interest
me
drinkability
this
is
just
a
boring
bland
ass
beer
nothing
bad
but
nothing
worth
sampling
again
would
i
have
another
if
i
come
across
it
somewhere
yes
but
i
wont
pay
for
it
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brown
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
produce
very
good
drinkable
beers
i
would
definitely
recommend
a
try
on
this
one
and
i
would
buy
it
again
in
quantity
to
keep
on
hand
overall
a
good
but
unremarkable
dark
ale
the
cherryinfused
nose
is
the
best
part
and
the
flavor
is
good
but
seems
to
become
quickly
muddled
worth
a
try
with
this
brew
a
beautiful
thick
head
sits
atop
a
slightly
reddish
dark
and
hazy
brown
liquid
the
aroma
is
intensely
chocolate
and
very
malty
theres
just
a
little
fruit
and
yeast
in
the
smell
and
its
otherwise
very
clean
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
little
caramel
and
moderately
roasted
malts
coming
through
in
addition
to
the
chocolate
flavor
the
beer
is
a
little
chalky
and
grainy
in
the
mouthfeel
but
is
otherwise
full
and
satisfying
this
is
a
good
belgian
brew
that
spotlights
the
roasted
malts
poured
dark
mahogany
with
miniscule
tan
head
light
lace
smells
of
roasted
caramel
malt
and
nuts
with
undercurrents

bitter
oak

roasted

behind
nice
balance

carbonation
and
creaminess
in
the

very
good
i
drank
it
with
a
blue
cheese
pasta
dish
which
acompanied
it
very
well
though
i
tasted
it
and
took
notes
before
eating
the
pasta
the
cheese
dulled
the
bitterness
and
made
me
percieve
this
beer
as
slightly
sweeter
which
i
personaly
prefered
aroma
is
a
collage
of
sweet
fruits
and
malts
cloudy

with
a

it
to

i
pick
up
up

with
a

finishing
with
a

but
pretty
abrupt
like
others
who
have
reviewed
this
one
i
think
its
not
to
complex
very
straight
forward
but
drinkable
but
i
likely
wont
seek
it
out
again
i
wasnt
overly
thrilled
with
bink

and
bruin
is
a
lesser
beer
in
my
eyes
im
beginning
to
realize
that
there
are
scads
of
great
belgian
beers
out
there
sadly
this
one
cant
be
counted
among
them
bink
bruin
was
opaque
brown
with
a
12
head
with
no
lace
the
aroma
was
pretty
busy
yeasty
grassy
at
first
then
sweeter
with
elements
of
molasses
and
caramel
as
it
warmed
the
taste
was
smooth
with
some
fruitiness
to
it
as
well
as
traces
of
molasses
and
a
decent
bite
the
finish
was
dry
yeasty
and
chalky
a
pretty
good
belgian
for
people
such
as
myself
whose
palates
arent
attuned
to
the
subtleties
of
many
belgian
beers
drinkability

this
is
a
good
bda
thats
on
the
fringe
its
simple
and
lacks
the
complexity
of
other
examples
of
the
style
but
is
very
direct
and
a
solid
drinker

its

find

thanks
rudy
for
an
awesome
extra
saw
this
one
on
tap
at
the
bethlehem
speakeasy
one
night
when
i
was
there
i
ordered
a
class
out
of
curiosity
the
beer
was
handed
to
me
as
a
really
nice
looking
dark
red
brew
with
a
big
fluffy
lookin
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
pretty
solid
for
the
majority
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
lightly
roasted
with
some
belgian
yeast
aromas
and
spice
on
the
nose
the
taste
i
thought
was
pretty
good
also
the
flavors
were
just
about
the
same
as
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
mostly
smooth
with
a
little
carbonation
in
there
overall
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
in
my
opinion
just
an
altogether
delicious
beer
from
this
brewery
pretty
much
everything
they
make
is
slightly
medicinal
mineral
notes
weak
and
not
memorable
an
unexciting
to
mediocre
belgian
i
was
looking
for
a
calm
middling
beer
tonight
and
even
that
relatively
low
bar
was
not
met
ive
been
fairly
dubious
of
this
bottle
since
i
purchased
it
its
an
odd
name
for
a
beer
and
it
was
on
sale
for
8
at
a
grocery
store
that
i
dont
normally
associate
with
good
beer
that
said
my
experience
matches
up
to
other
reviews
so
i
dont
think
that
the
bottle
was
bad
or
anything
the
beer
pours
a
normal
enough
warm
brownamber
color
with
an
extremely
effervescent
head
the
head
puffs
up
hugely
at
first
filling
the
glass
with
bubbles
with
only
a
couple
inches
of
liquid
despite
all
of
this
initial
excitement
the
head
actually
dissipated
quite
quickly
and
left
very
little
lacing
its
actually
sort
of
funny
that
there
were
so
many
bubbles
in
the
appearance
because
the
mouthfeel
is
distinctly
undercarbonated
i
would
admit
if
this
were
my
fault
from
an
overly
vigorous
pour
but
i
babied
it
into
the
glass
trying
to
avoid
the
monstrous
head
the
smell
is
really
lacking
its
a
flat
yeasty
odor
with
very
little
of
the
normal
complexity
of
good
belgian
yeast
im
not
sure
how
the
yeast
would
really
be
at
fault
so
im
not
totally
sure
whats
wrong
with
this
beer
the
flavor
is
somewhat
better
but
still
odd
its
sweet
with
a
fair
bit
of
caramel
and
bread
malt
flavor
but
its
not
really
very
interesting
or
complex
the
bitter
yeasty
flavor
is
also
there
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
merely
passing
earthy
belgian
note
the
beer
just
doesnt
come
together
its
not
awful
but
if
youre
going
to
make
an
oddball
belgian
variation
its
got
to
be
good
experimental
or
not
this
beer
doesnt
really
work
on
any
level

most
a

this
good
deserves
a
much
more
accomplished
final
product
i
would
like
to
see
these
guys
brew
an
authentic
belgian
pale
ale
that
bears
little
resemblance
to
the
beer
im
drinking
now
this
is
an
interesting
belgian
certainly
lighter
and
with
less
alcohol
than
you
will
typically
find
for
the
style
and
very
drinkable
the
beer
pours
an
orangish
amber
slightly
cloudy
not
much
head
retention
or
lacing
to
speak
of
there
is
some
off
white
head
and
the
smell
is
malty
grainy
good
but
not
brilliant
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
gets
a
bit
more
watery
as
things
settle
i
like
the
creamy
mouthfeel
best
you
will
find
a
nice
buttery
smoothness
on
the
tongue
that
is
quite
nice
the
taste
is
clearly
malty
somewhat
grainy
a
bit
on
the
lemoncitrus
end
of
the
continuum
and
there
is
a
touch
of
the
candied
sugars
in
the
fermentation
this
is
really
a
belgian
lite
type
of
experience
you
wont
get
the
yeasty
zing
the
syrupy
candied
sugar
experience
the
spicy
clove
or
the
alcoholy
warming
notes
typical
of
the
style
youll
get
a
pretty
mild
somewhat
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
in
the
finish
and
no
real
after
taste
to
speak
of
this
beer
wont
challenge
anyones
palate
but
neither
will
it
offend
its
worth
seeking
out
for
a
nice
introduction
to
a
belgian
ale

some
of
the
more
challenging
yet
complex
characteristics

this
is
a
good
belgian
ale
but
id
probably
call
it
a
pale
ale
instead
of
a
dark
ale
othis
definitely
isnt
a
bad
belgian
there
are
no
bad
flavors
its
just
a
tad
bit
more
mellow
than
i
like
my
beers
which
wouldnt
be
terrible
if
it
were
cheaper
id
recommend
people
to
give
it
a
try
it
has
a
unique
cocoa
character
to
it
o
after
tracking
down
valeir
blond
and
being
impressed
by
such
depth
in
a
standard
belgian
pale
ale
i
expected
to
be
impressed
by
valeir
donker
unfortunately
my
expectations
may
have
been
unreasonably
high
as
this
ale
slightly
misses
the
mark
i
found
the
body
to
be
too
thin
the
carbonation
to
be
too
gentle
and
the
flavor
profile
to
lean
a
little
too
heavily
towards
cloying
sweetness
while
valeir
donker
may
not
be
a
bad
beer
by
any
measure
it
isnt
a
great
one
either
decent
but
a
little
out
of
whack
nevertheless
o
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
there
are
definitely
other
bdas
that
i
would
choose
first
o
the
nose
was
promising
but
the
flavour
wasnt
really
doing
it
for
me
solid
nothing
else
i
inhale
figs
and
bananas
together
an
interesting
combination
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
the
malt
contribution
is
a
delectable
flavor
tastes
good
going
down
but
quite
similar
to
the
aromatic
description
the
banana
is
a
bit
detracting
from
a
stylistic
standpoint
but
works
well
enough
with
the
other
flavors
to
not
be
disappointing
a
good
effort
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
other
treats
while
nothing
spectacular
i
thought
this
still
a
pretty
strong
effort
from
this
always
excellent
and
reliable
brewery
d
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
because
the
flavor
is
rather
complex
and
interesting
looks
and
smells
good
but
its
all
down
hill
from
there
a
nice
rich
beer
even
balanced
character
without
all
the
sweet
the
nose
suggests
a
very
enjoyable
brew
not
earth
shattering
but
i
would
certainly
repeat
overall
its
a
really
enjoyable
fairly
complex
beer
that
somehow
is
also
quite
readily
accessible
even
for
a
dark
beer
people
that
dont
normally
enjoy
beer
will
probably
like
this
one
especially
if
they
enjoy
darker
red
wines

nice

seeking

youd
expect

could
probably

it
stubby

dark
murky
chocolate

an

huge

with
dark

and
a

goodness

nice
adchiefment
and
enjoyable
brew
that
shows
lots
of
taste
for
its
6

nice
dark
brown
color
with
this
tin
wispy
head
of
off
white
that
capped
the
top
only
for
a
slight
time
offering
little
in
the
way
of
side
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malts
light
smoke
and
hints
of
chocolate
nice
and
warming
but
lacked
the
punch
i
was
looking
for
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
not
bad
at
all
had
all
the
right
markers
there
with
light
peat
lots
of
chocolate
deep
roasted
profile
just
too
light
for
me
to
be
honest
thin
feel
to
hell
with
this
this
beer
is
madness
in
a
bottle
it
tastes
so
good
and
is
so
easy
drinking
that
one
quickly
forgets
the
high
abv
i
did
i
had
several
of
these
at
the
bbc
taproom
on
clay
and
main
afterwards
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
take
my
longboard
down
the
block
to
the
louisville
skatepark
brilliant
i
think
i
broke
my
wrist
right
before
i
bounced
my
chin
off
the
concrete
hell
for
certain
delicious
drink
with
caution
d
after
the
smell
this
one
sort
of
fell
apart
on
me
i
dont
think
id
seek
it
out
again
d
ok
but
lacks
overall
traditional
belgian
dubbel
quality
getting
there
but
not
there
yet
overall
a
well
done
ale
compared
to
a
belgian
dark
ale
it
is
pedestrian
that
said
i
enjoyed
drinking
a
few
of
this
pleasurable
and
worth
purchasing
pretty
solid
offering
from
bbc
who
im
not
typically
so
impressed
by
not
an
incredible
beer
but
a
really
solid
and
drinkable
intro
to
belgians
from
a
good
local
company
drinkability
moderate
its
kind
of
a
heavier
beer
in
the
body
and
the
flavors
werent
quite
as
balanced
as
ive
had
in
some
other
belgian
darks
not
bad
overall
but
i
feel
like
i
was
a
little
too
excited
about
coming
across
this
in
the
bottle
oh
well
d
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
beer
not
one
ill
seek
out
for
another
round
as
a
bit
of
trivia
hell
for
certain
is
named
after
an
area
of
the
same
name
in
southeastern
ky
just
a
bit
south
of
hell
creek
and
whynot
you
really
cant
make
these
things
up
some
alcohol
yeast
and
malt
in
nose
whitish
foam
very
mild
brownish
body
some
yeast
in
taste
bown
sugar
and
pepper
and
cloves
and
raisin
not
too
drinkable
and
a
fairly
mediocre
belg
above
average
mouthfeel
and
appropriate
carbonation
found
at
warehouse
beverages
for
a
6
6
abv
this
is
extremely
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
many
of
them
because
of
the
sweetness
i
would
definately
order
it
again
final
thought
solid
belgian
strong
from
one
of
the
midwests
finest
breweries
a
little
sweeter
than
most
of
this
style
tasted
on
4308
bottled
oct
07
d
an
easy
drinker
certainly
but
i
expected
a
lot
more
when
it
poured
it
just
seems
lacking
in
punch
in
flavor
and
feel
for
having
such
an
intimidating
moniker
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
an
impressive
off
white
head
aroma
is
yeasty
with
some
nuttiness
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
bready
toasty
slightly
sour
unmemorable
and
bland
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
i
drank
half
the
bottle
before
getting
bored
with
it
and
dumped
the
rest
out
moved
on
to
something
better
pass
on
this
beer
actually
pass
on
just
about
everything
the
bbc
has
to
offer
they
have
a
few
gems
in
there
but
they
are
far
and
inbetween
d
drinkable
beer
and
very
nice
for
the
level
of
alcohol
but
there
are
a
lot
better
belgian
strong
dark
ales
out
there
taste
is
of
light
toasted
malt
raisin
and
fairly
hohum
not
really
a
standout
but
ok
burnt
molasses
and
graham
cracker
too
much
diacetyl
presence
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
possibly
due
to
the
addition
of
yeast
pretty
ambiguous
overall
i
could
finish
a
bottle
but
didnt
want
another
thanks
for
letting
me
try
this

well
the
beer
is

still
herbacious
menthol
fennel
starfruit
pineapple
tangerine
pomeganate
coriander
caramel
belgian

and

lacks
body
and

im
not
crazy
about
much
of
the
yeast
and
spices
in
certain
belgian
and
belgian
style
brews
and
this
is
one
of
them
which
hurts
drinkability
for
me
i
was
amused
to
learn
that
hell
for
certain
is
a
town
in
kentucky
that
takes
its
name
from
a
nearby
creek
ive
had
four
bluegrass
beers
now
and
three
of
them
have
blown
me
away
im
beginning
to
suspect
that
the
brewers
have
sold
their
souls
to
the
devil
if
so
i
hope
they
take
plenty
of
this
bewitchingly
spicy
brew
along
to
their
final
destination
i
hear

it
kind

theres
not

at

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
liquor
barn
lexington
ky
slightly
hazy
bronzycopperamber
in
hue
attractive
there
wasnt
much
of
a
head
that
formed
actually
there
wasnt
any
head
just
a
small
collar
almost
naked
in
the
middle
i
think
the
foam
is
offwhite
in
color
there
really
isnt
much
to
look
at
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
this
beer
is
dull
in
appearance
for
a
belgiumstyle
beer
the
nose
isnt
very
chatty
and
it
doesnt
speak
with
much
of
a
belgian
accent
sugarysweet
and
alcoholic
are
the
main
aromas
behind
this
are
some
fruity
notes
mainly
melons
and
a
kiss
of
rinds
from
the
hops
i
assume
at
the
back
is
some
nondescript
maltiness
i
cant
say
the
bouquet
impresses
me
much
it
is
not
bad
but
too
close
to
boring
so
i
cant
call
it
inviting
the
palate
is
good
it
has
a
maltybackbone
that
reminds
me
of
mcchouffe
hfc
is
fruiter
though
i
like
the
apple
flavors
pears
melons
and
juicy
tropical
fruit
hmm
a
belgium
amber
ale
maybe
this
beer
is
plenty
sweet
almost
too
sweet
for
me
sugary
in
the
middle
by
the
finish
the
beer
does
dry
out
just
enough
to
make
it
quaffable
the
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
but
firm
enough
for
balance
by
the
end
there
are
enough
flavors
going
on
for
me
to
care
however
enough
doesnt
make
this
a
great
beer
it
is
too
clean
for
one
thing
id
drink
it
again
once
at
room
temperature
i
liked
it
much
more
as
more
layers
of
flavors
could
be
enjoyed
this
is
obviously
the
way
to
drink
this
beer
slightly
cooler
than
cellar
temperature
didnt
work
out
as
well
medium
in
body
a
tickle
thin
and
watery
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
low
as
well
if
the
carbonation
was
livelier
and
the
body
was
bigger
this
beer
would
be
much
better
this
is
only
the
truly
negative
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
it
is
drinkable
and
likable
it
is
friendly
but
not
aggressive
enough
my
tastes
but
this
is
yet
another
solid
offering
from
the
bbc
thanks
sheepnutz
for
the
sample
worth
a
try
this
was
a
good
beer
for
food
probably
steak
or
chicken
it
was
suprisingly
refreshing
to
be
as
thick
as
it
was
thanks
sheepnutz
i
dont
know
where
they
get
calling
this
a
belgian
style
ale
its
lacking
of
any
belgian
characteristics
and
judging
by
the
other
reviews
here
i
think
i
am
drinking
a
completely
different
beer
if
anything
it
tastes
like
an
arrogant
bastard
mixed
4060
with
a
crummy
leiny
bock
and
left
to
stand
for
12
hour
despite
this
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
and
really
cheap
i
would
probably
drink
this
stuff
very
drinkable
it
must
be
some
kind
of
uk
curse
that
im
drinking
this
on
the
eve
of
the
ncaas
drinkability
tastes
stronger
than
it
is
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
several
of
but
the
overstated
alcohol
feel
may
make
you
leery
of
having
too
many
the
body
is
a
distinctly
reddish
medium
brown
body
with
a
buttery
head
that
is
small
and
fades
fairly
quickly
its
clear
and
seems
like
its
probably
filtered
the
aroma
is
extremely
fruity
honeydew
melon
and
apples
maybe
a
little
grape
honey
a
little
clove
the
flavor
is
just
as
nice
but
its
so
short
you
get
this
big
blast
of
a
great
flavor
like
la
trappe
dubbel
without
the
cloying
sweetness
but
it
doesnt
linger
the
body
is
lacking
a
bit
too
i
think
its
because
its
not
bottle
conditioned
if
theyd
stick
this
in
a
750
and
let
it
bottle
condition
to
carbonate
instead
of
what
their
doing
theyd
have
an
excellent
beer
here
much
better
than
their
dark
star
porterwhich
is
decent
this
one
pours
a
clear
copper
amber
with
a
better
than
expected
tan
head
that
leaves
some
sheet
lacing
eventually
fading
to
collar
and
slick
lace
not
a
bad
appearance
aroma
is
plums
and
dark
cherries
banana
bread
halved
with
cinamon
raisin
bread
pretty
good
so
far
mouthfeel
has
a
hoppy
bite
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
for
the
style
taste
is
much
better
than
expected
plums
and
cherries
some
mcintosh
apples
molasses
and
some
vanilla
flavors
slight
floral
hop
bitterness
keeps
the
sweet
fruit
flavors
from
being
cloying
finishes
with
a
fresh
and
fruity
mcintosh
apple
taste
with
a
pleasant
dryness
doesnt
taste
like
a
strong
belgian
ale
at
all
but
is
a
very
nice
ale
hat
deserves
its
own
niche
in
the
heirarchy
of
american
strong
ambers
bright
garnet
with
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
lacks
substantial
head
and
lace
but
attractivenonetheless
fresh
nose
of
apricot
yeast
coriander
and
peppercorn
ripe
fruit
namely
apricot
in
addition
to
coriander
pepper
and
a
definite
presence
of
earthy
hops
make
up
the
flavor
profile
of
this
ale
as
the
beer
reaches
room
temperature
the
beer
turns
fruitier
and
spicier
creating
a
twodimensional
flavor
with
pronounced
citrus
character
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
smooth
wellcarbonated
and
honestly
better
than
expected
a
very
drinkable
belgianstyle
ale
from
bluegrass
in
what
id
imagine
is
to
be
similar
to
the
dubbel
style
overall
a
tasty
beer
though
a
bit
lacking
in
true
belgian
character
i
felt
quite
let
down
by
this
brew
hell
for
certain
didnt
get
any
better
as
it
warmed
only
imparting
an
alcohol
astringency
to
go
with
the
palatekilling
metal
taste
hell
for
certain
at
least
tastewise
i
did
not
have
high
expectations
for
this
brew
after
having
several
of
the
other
bbc
offerings
but
i
was
surprised
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
filled
with
mostly
spices
and
a
citrustype
smell
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
starts
out
with
fruits
and
spices
and
finishes
a
little
dry
similar
to
the
last
belgian
dubbel
i
had
actually
this
is
a
pretty
decent
offering
for
a
kentucky
based
belgianstyle
beer
but
there
are
others
that
are
better
f
this
beer
formed
a
small
sized
tan
head
when
poured
that
contained
fine
sized
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
the
body
was
cloudy
and
it
was
carbonated
the
hue
was
copper
and
the
nose
was
malty
fruity
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
was
bitter
with
alcohol
and
it
left
an
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
tingly
on
my
tongue
smooth
and
medium
bodied
there
was
no
lacing
with
this
beer
thank
you
to
aaronh
for
this
beer
another
enjoyable
treat
from
the
bluegrass
people
not
a
bad
dubbel
by
any
stretch
and
certainly
another
beer
that
it
is
a
shame
isnt
distributed
around
here
this
review
prompted
by
the
death
of
uday
and
qasay
hussein
its
a
hell
for
certain
for
you
i
had
this
brew
on
tap
in
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
red
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
consists
of
cloves
with
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
and
some
hops
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
spice
with
a
bit
of
a
hops
finish
the
body
is
just
a
little
light
for
this
style
but
not
bad
overall
it
has
a
fairly
nice
drinkability
also
not
a
bad
try
at
a
belgian
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
from
a
brewery
that
im
gaining
a
great
amount
of
respect
for
fantastic
beer
to
see
setting
in
the
glass
an
eye
pleasing
cherry
red
with
a
masterful
head
that
is
light
tan
in
color
with
the
lace
glutinous
sheets
that
cling
mightily
to
the
glass
over
ripe
pineapple
aromas
hints
of
fusel
alcohol
malt
sweet
and
a
real
sniffer
start
dominated
by
the
malt
the
top
middling
in
feel
the
finish
purposeful
in
it
acidity
the
hops
meaningful
in
their
spicy
bite
dry
aftertaste
that
is
somewhat
sour
quite
reminiscent
of
a
flanders
red
sour
ale
a
real
yummy
for
the
tummy
and
the
palate
hell
for
certain
is
very
pleasant
surprise
based
on
what
ive
had
from
bbc
and
heard
from
others
i
expected
a
very
good
belgianstyle
brew
what
i
got
was
an
amazing
belgianstyle
brew
it
has
a
rich
aroma
of
fruit
and
peppery
spice
the
flavor
starts
rather
fruity
and
finishes
with
a
dry
spicy
taste
i
also
notice
a
lingering
taste
of
apple
as
an
aftertaste
very
good
with
an
assortment
of
cheeses
but
better
alone
listed
here
as
a
dark
strong
belgian
i
probably
would
tag
it
as
a
dubbel
some
candy
sweetness
in
the
nose
malty
with
sweet
fruity
esters
flavor
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
style
whichever
way
you
want
to
make
the
call
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
interpretation
bbc
is
no
ommegang
but
they
brewed
a
pretty
tasty
beer
here
very
flavorful
and
waiting
to
try
more
quite
drinkable
just
not
interesting
definitely
influenced
by
belgian
dark
ales
this
is
a
solid
offering
that
features
a
strong
dark
fruit
flavor
profile
o
ok
nice
blend
tasty
american
brown
with
a
twist
overall
a
good
offering
from
karl
strauss
the
flavor
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
mouth
but
theres
enough
complexity
there
to
keep
your
interest
the
smooth
drinkable
quality
is
this
beers
strong
point
its
no
wow
beer
but
something
i
think
a
vast
majority
will
find
at
least
somewhat
enjoyable
the
weird
musty
aroma
of
this
beer
kept
me
engaged
tobacco
roasted
nuts
burning
wood
reminds
me
of
a
nice
fireside
story
equals
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
this
beer
would
be
quirky
any
other
time
of
the
year
though
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
good
work
ks
from
the
tap
nice
color
it
is
a
brown
ale
for
sure
picked
up
a
lot
of
flavors
form
the
smell
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
sweetness
has
a
but
of
creaminess
nice
a
smooth
finishes
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
taste
a
slight
bit
sweeter
then
i
usually
go
for
but
very
good
over
all
takes
a
few
drinks
to
really
pick
out
all
of
the
flavors
but
it
just
goes
to
show
that
they
are
blended
together
very
seamlessly
not
a
bad
price
at
7
99
a
sixer
but
i
wont
be
revsiting
this
one
again
i
think
a
pretty
great
seasonal
beer
dark
brown
pour
and
you
can
see
the
carbonation
rush
to
the
surface
but
it
mellows
out
after
being
left
to
warm
for
a
bit
smell
of
dark
fruit
oaky
and
cherry
rich
taste
way
more
complex
that
i
expected
love
the
way
the
oakiness
cuts
through
at
the
end
of
each
sip
i
feel
like
the
taste
is
a
good
blend
of
things
that
i
didnt
really
picture
being
together
and
although
i
am
not
always
the
biggest
fan
of
sweeter
stuff
i
think
the
flavors
work
really
well
together
there
is
a
slight
warmth
of
alcohol
and
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
well
carbonated
definitely
would
buy
this
again
a
pleasant
surprise
o
good
as
an
americanbelgian
dark
doesnt
really
hold
up
against
anything
from
the
namesake
country
but
its
a
great
allaround
and
i
could
drink
a
few
as
it
heated
up
more
great
flavor
came
out
so
give
it
some
time
out
of
the
fridge
overall
a
strange
combination
of
flavors
that
works
pretty
well
together
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
belgian
yeast
aromas
taste
is
pretty
malty
and
a
bit
nutty
with
a
subdued
yeast
flavor
a
subtle
chocolate
flavor
comes
out
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
with
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
belgian
ale
but
it
could
be
developed
more
t
definitely
a
lot
more
complex
than
i
was
expecting
roasted
malt
and
some
dark
fruit
hit
first
followed
by
some
hazelnut
and
brown
sugar
i
had
two
and
enjoyed
both
of
them
a
lot
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
this
couldve
been
a
few
spots
higher
or
lower
with
the
ratings
but
i
ended
up
with
this
rating
good
beer
it
would
be
a
super
oktoberfest
beer
if
the
germans
had
a
sense
of
humor
one
of
my
favorite
san
diego
beers
and
a
good
one
for
winter
drink
good
point
will
have
to
grab
again
next
year
after
finding
out
about
it
too
late
well
done
mr
strauss
i
think
youre
on
the
right
path
here

a

with

the
inexplicably
overrated
1554
d
a
good
brown
ale
with
a
remarkably
enjoyable
finish
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
that
is
belgian
about
the
sensory
profile
of
this
beer
the
yeast
does
not
stand
out
on
its
own
instead
complementing
the
malt
to
bring
out
satisfying
nutty
character
nor
is
it
sour
with
the
acidity
detected
being
carbonic
in
nature
whether
the
yeast
strain
used
was
from
belgium
or
somewhere
else
it
is
safe
to
say
that
it
was
the
right
yeast
for
the
job
helping
to
yield
a
finished
product
that
is
better
than
expected
poured
ontap
in
downtown
san
diego
at
the
columbia
street
brewpub
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
dark
nutbrown
color
with
hazelnut
highlights
and
a
thin
dense
head
the
beer
has
a
good
aroma
with
smells
of
nut
coriander
nutmeg
and
malt
the
beer
flavors
are
coriander
spices
of
a
typical
belgian
with
the
rounded
malt
and
nut
flavors
of
a
brown
the
sweetness
disappears
on
the
transition
to
the
aftertaste
the
finish
is
a
balance
of
clove
and
sweet
malt
the
aftertaste
and
finish
are
not
great
for
an
already
struggling
beer
d
im
enjoying
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
pretty
easy
drinking
i
like
how
the
belgian
yeast
adds
to
the
flavor
of
the
brown
ale
base
this
is
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
around
overall
great
beer
quite
possibly
one
of
my
top
10s
had
this
at
sallys
in
san
diego
walnut
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
lasted
a
good
60
seconds
was
served
way
too
cold
so
there
wasnt
much
aroma
in
fact
there
wasnt
much
aroma
after
it
warmed
up
either
although
i
managed
to
detect
some
caramel
and
apricots
at
some
point
mild
carbonation
was
nice
and
provided
a
prickly
base
for
the
dried
fruit
and
light
hops
in
the
taste
but
over
all
this
was
a
rather
blah
beeah
i
dont
see
much
relation
between
this
beer
and
any
other
belgian
dark
ive
had
i
like
the
name
but
id
avoid
another
glass
of
this
karl
strauss
has
recently
put
out
a
couple
of
their
best
beers
in
bottles
this
and
to
the
9s
theyve
done
an
excellent
job
and
it
is
really
promising
for
the
future
ive
always
had
mixed
feelings
about
their
beers
besides
the
generally
solid
amber
ale
most
of
their
beers
have
had
something
off
in
the
flavor
that
irritated
me
im
glad
to
enjoy
their
new
beers
both
on
tap
and
from
the
bottle
and
i
look
forward
to
more
of
them
rich
and
complex
i
think
it
was
a
bigger
beer
it
would
be
harder
to
put
down
as
the
phenols
and
alcohol
would
have
taken
over
but
being
it
is
a
midsized
beer
it
holds
on
to
some
drinkability
good
stuff
all
around
uh
no
poured
a
bright
clear
brown
with
a
short
light
tan
head
then
it
goes
downhill
dirty
oldsmelling
caramel
malt
with
cocoa
powder
and
a
depserate
attempt
at
belgian
spice
flat
mouthfeel
bland
malt
monster
with
molasses
and
alcohol
taking
over
the
beer
sickening
sweet
finish
which
i
guess
makes
this
a
belgian
brown
at
least
thats
what
its
advertised
as
no
thank
you
drinkability
very
drinkable
at
6
3
abv
it
is
still
very
smooth
and
sessionable
ill
continue
throwing
a
few
of
these
back
d
another
nice
cask
beer
from
karl
strauss
after
having
the
ipa
back
in
august
08
while
i
havent
been
that
impressed
with
their
bottled
offerings
these
cask
brews
are
quite
good
glad
i
got
to
try
it
taste
offers
some
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
and
a
subtle
hint
of
coffeechocolate
basically
an
average
american
brown
ale
given
the
moniker
i
expected
a
bit
more
of
a
belgian
nose
no
check
that
i
expected
something
of
a
belgian
nose
i
got
neither
drinkability
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
which
i
enjoyed
but
i
dont
know
how
many
more
i
would
want
to
drink
there
are
definitely
better
belgian
browns
out
there
poured
a
darker
brown
color
with
a
smaller
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
chocolate
woody
vanilla
and
somewhat
earthy
tastes
of
vanilla
chocolate
lighter
woodiness
and
caramel
rjt
o
soso
probably
the
result
of
being
a
bit
old
looks
nice
enough
and
the
aroma
is
satisfyingly
fruity
unfortunately
the
flavour
is
rather
lacklustre
and
wishywashy
with
some
undesirable
offnotes
body
is
alright
but
a
bit
watery
not
a
standout
brew
o
if
this
beer
was
as
tasty
as
it
is
beautiful
looking
it
would
be
excellent
but
the
flavor
is
just
lacking
all
around
somewhat
enjoyable
but
probably
not
a
repeat
food
match
the
spot
on
acidity
levels
in
this
would
cut
right
through
a
cheese
platter
well
i
would
also
recommend
some
fresh
crusty
bread
and
creamy
soups
with
this
ale
overall
a
drinkable
version
of
an
abbey
from
belgium
bitterness
is
almost
not
present
but
is
a
refreshing
beer
too
o
quite
nice
as
a
belgian
darkamber
with
the
crispness
as
well
as
the
malty
smokey
flavours
perhaps
a
little
too
light
for
my
taste
as
im
not
greatly
experienced
in
this
particular
style
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
flavour
at
least
some
pleasant
aftertaste
however
it
is
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
day
when
you
still
want
some
of
the
flavour
profile
of
darker
beers
with
the
crispness
of
an
amber
iam
not
sure
if
this
a
belgian
pale
in
style
but
i
gotta
say
i
liked
this
beer
alot
poured
into
a
chalice
a
mix
of
slightly
hazed
deep
burnt
orange
and
copper
color
with
a
great
looking
billowing
light
tan
colored
creamy
head
atop
aromas
of
light
spiced
phenolsdark
fruitand
mild
nuttiness
flavors
of
not
overly
sweet
toffee
and
cakeagain
some
nuttiness
comes
into
play
along
with
spice
and
dark
fruit
this
a
solid
belgian
dark
in
my
opinonvery
quaffable
but
packing
nice
flavors
nice
beer
a
sipper
and
one
that
would
get
to
be
a
chore
to
get
thru
after
23
but
still
very
good
overall
this
beer
was
surprising
a
quick
look
at
the
bottle
makes
me
think
of
a
nondescript
blonde
ale
this
beer
contained
many
challenging
layers
to
this
belgian
beer
newbie
i
would
call
it
very
good
excellent
if
not
for
a
couple
sips
with
off
flavors
the
beer
effortlessly
reaches
every
aspect
that
blonde
ales
prescribe
though
its
flawless
in
taste
i
keep
looking
for
the
intangibles
that
set
it
apart
the
beer
may
stop
shy
of
those
incredible
and
unexpected
flavors
but
the
beer
is
near
perfect
as
it
is
taste
is
light
fruity
with
some
caramellic
and
bready
notes
the
beer
has
a
light
mouthfeel
which
makes
the
beer
very
drinkable
but
also
lighten
the
overall
experience
there
is
a
light
bitterness
which
gets
more
pronounced
once
swallowed
aftertaste
is
bready
crusty
and
has
a
medium
short
bitterness
o
it
isnt
bad
but
i
prefer
other
beers
in
this
style
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
pale
ale
the
corsendonk
people
know
what
sells
this
is
a
beer
that
fits
the
bill
completely
seems
quite
light
and
refreshing
even
though
it
has
a
bit
of
a
dark
colour
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
but
that
is
the
only
positive
i
can
tell
about
this
one
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
you
think
you
are
drinking
a
non
alcohol
beer
there
is
no
deepness
in
this
beer
with
a
flat
taste
at
the
end
the
beer
became
a
bit
better
but
that
was
too
late
conclusion
even
if
it
does
not
live
up
to
its
nose
this
seems
to
be
a
perfect
summer
beer
also
has
a
bit
a
begian
ipa
going
on
flavor
is
solid
but
not
anything
amazing
lots
of
belgian
yeasts
and
malts
infact
theres
a
slight
saison
presence
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
a
great
summer
beer
decent
drinkability
light
mouthfeel
crisp
and
sharp
high
carbonation
a
very
tasty
and
solid
bpa
pours
a
reddish
copper
with
a
nice
thick
frothy
head
nose
is
very
clean
almost
soapy
with
aromas
of
anise
and
juniper
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
soft
orange
or
lemon
flavor
is
spicy
and
a
soapsunscreen
character
overwhelmed
by
the
spice
however
a
slightly
sour
finish
and
a
thin
body
it
surprized
me
pleasantly
a
nice
little
surprise
i
found
today
and
im
glad
to
be
the
one
that
adds
it
reminds
me
of
a
british
bitter
with
a
belgian
twist
i
liked
this
better
on
tap
it
was
much
fruitier
and
had
a
nice
herbal
earthy
profile
kind
of
floral
going
to
age
a
few
bottles
and
revisit
later
on
looks
like
an
amber
smells
fresh
bright
like
floral
spring
time
dried
fruit
a
little
salty
coriander
a
little
citrus
zest
this
was
the
best
of
my
sampler
pack
just
ok
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
case
the
spice
is
enough
to
keep
balance
without
overwhelming
a
nice
stab
at
a
belgian
style
brew
though
it
wouldnt
rank
with
the
classics
it
is
an
enjoyable
winter
sipper
overall
the
bitter
orange
peel
flavor
and
bitter
linger
takes
away
from
the
enjoyment
of
this
brew
still
for
a
buck
a
bottle
nothing
wrong
with
knocking
back
a12
pack
of
this
baby
i
enjoy
the
snowstorm
series
from
schells
snowstorm
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
very
nice
spicy
aroma
big
hints
of
dark
spices
and
dry
fruits
the
taste
is
the
same
big
spice
bill
lots
of
dry
fruit
body
a
a
tad
weak
but
nice
body
overall
very
spicy
very
flavorful
overall
i
like
to
try
the
schell
snowstorm
each
year
even
when
it
might
be
a
style
that
i
dont
prefer
this
years
version
reminds
me
of
a
dubbel
but
it
looks
like
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
snowstorm
2007
which
was
actually
called
a
dubbel
fruity
and
earthy
but
more
breadiness
than
most
dubbels
per
my
senses
overall
this
is
another
winner
as
have
been
the
past
two
years
of
snowstorms
for
the
price
i
doubt
it
can
be
beat
medium
bodied
smooth
easy
to
drink
with
proper
carbonation
this
is
another
very
nice
snowstorm
beer
from
schells
i
should
definitely
drink
more
of
their
beers
than
i
do
they
brew
great
beers
and
the
prices
are
always
reasonable
overall
a
really
nice
take
on
a
belgian
ale
especially
for
the
price
well
done
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
belgian
ale
seems
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
a
cru
nice
mix
of
spices
and
fruit
esters
overall
nice
easy
drinking
belgian
ale
i
would
rather
they
went
the
full
noel
route
and
made
this
9
but
still
enjoyable
altogether
its
reminiscent
of
the
better
aspects
of
several
past
snowstorms
and
one
of
the
stag
series
offerings
will
probably
go
great
with
thanksgiving
turkey
this
year
this
is
really
complex
seems
to
match
several
of
the
latest
snowstorms
in
moderate
alcohol
drinks
that
take
time
to
get
to
know
and
enjoy
most
fully
as
with
the
previous
ones
im
sure
ill
get
to
know
this
one
better
and
in
time
our
friendship
will
grow
maybe
thats
what
they
mean
by
great
growth
literal
translation
of
grand
cru
or
maybe
its
just
a
special
seasonal
beer
either
way
another
snowstorm
to
enjoy
im
glad
its
here
o
certainly
not
a
stout
with
more
dark
fruit
than
chocolate
still
enjoyable
though
this
is
a
chocolate
ale
for
those
who
like
their
chocolate
dark
and
not
very
sweet
none
of
the
hersheys
milk
chocolate
effect
here
the
chocolate
is
one
element
in
a
mix
of
roasty
flavors
but
the
chocolate
doesnt
overwhelm
the
stout
the
beer
is
just
a
little
tart
and
has
a
bit
of
bitterness
like
coffee
bitterness
not
the
effect
of
hops
this
beer
is
not
sweet
at
all
very
tasty

the

was

overall
this
was
quite
a

next

id
like
to
try
one
fresh
to
see
how
the
aging
treated
this
beer
enjoyable
chocolate
stout
better
than
most
versions
of
this
style
a
good
choice
to
pair
with
dessert
overall
not
sure
if
this
is
a
dark
ale
or
stout
but
im
happy
either
way
got
better
as
it
warmed
not
a
stout
as
the
name
would
dictate
but
a
very
tasty
belgian
dark

dark

is

starting

ending
bitter
with
some

and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium

and
medium
carbonation
which
starts
active
on
the
palate
and
goes
fully
creamy
with
some
slight
dryness
overall
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
that
brought
chocolate
flavors
with
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
this
is
an
excellent
chocolate
stout
of
which
i
usually
keep
a
couple
bottles
around
the
appearance
is
very
appealing
large
creamy
head
and
good
lacing
atop
a
deliciously
dark
brew
topped
by
the
alluring
aroma
of
chocolate
the
flavor
is
chocolaty
and
delicious
with
only
the
slight
taste
of
alcohol
detracting
from
the
pleasure
overall
a
very
exquisite
brew
o
not
what
i
expected
at
all
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
at
the
pricepoint
not
sure
if
id
get
it
again
but
im
not
disappointed
with
the
purchase
overall
my
first
tastes
of
this
beer
cold
from
fridge
were
good
as
it
came
to
temp
the
nose
improved
but
the
taste
actually
started
to
weaken
in
my
mind
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
great
i
definitely
wouldnt
grab
it
if
looking
for
a
sweeter
dessert
beer
but
for
a
darker
belgian
style
ale
its
worth
a
taste
overall
the
taste
and
look
were
quite
nice
big
and
dark
with
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
but
the
aroma
and
feel
were
just
ok
overall
a
nice
beer
to
try
but
not
really
worth
the
big
bottle
price
of
over
10
poured
from
750
ml
corked
bottle
into
a
liefmans

my
preferred

flavor
gives
up
a
nice
blend
of
some
choco
cocoa
and
mocha
this
all
gives
a
pleasant
light
level
of
sweetness
to
this
offering
delving
in
a
bit
further
i
get
a
bit
of
a
funky
belgian
character
bringing
things
to
a
close
theres
some
floral
hop
action
in
the
very
dry
finish
overall
not
bad
though
i
was
expecting
btter
from
ommegang
prosit
1645
i
believe
the
year
of
age
has
made
this
bottle
even
better
it
was
a
delight
to
drink
overall
decent
beer
but
a
misleading
one
when
i
read
chocolate

i
was
kind
of
misled
by
this
one
from
the
name
dont
get
me
wrong
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
wasnt
chocolatey
enough
err
at
all
its
well
intended
but
less
than
stellar
o
an
interesting
beer
thats
kind
of
an
oddball
definitely
the
malt
bill
of
a
stout
but
a
belgian
yeast
strain
good
flavors
and
it
meshes
pretty
well
the
fruity
esters
provide
a
nice
contrast
to
the
dark
roast
malt
and
chocolate
oa
decent
beer
fresh
it
might
have
been
better
but
being
a
want
it
was
great
to
try
it
o
very
enjoyable
but
there
is
just
a
little
too
much
alcohol
presence
in
this
beer
after
it
warms
up
to
room
temperature
to
be
an
easy
drinker
the
dryness
in
the
mouthfeel
combined
with
the
light
sweetness
make
this
a
sipping
beer
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
definitely
mellowed
with
age
i
had
this
fresh
and
remember
it
being
considerably
more
bitter
as
a
side
note
i
wish
rhey
would
seperate
belgian
stouts
out
on
their
own
o
roasty
stout
with
some
belgian
yeast
pretty
simple
and
tasty
not
as
much
chocolate
as
the
name
would
imply
which
was
a
bit
disappointing
but
otherwise
a
good
beer
wish
there
were
a
category
for
belgian
stouts
this
certainly
isnt
a
typical
belgian
dark
pours
dark
brown
with
about
a
12
inch
if
tan
foam
looks
like
some
light
colored
yeast
floaters
settling
to
the
bottom
i
get
some
light
belgium
aroma
maybe
banana
and
a
little
chocolate
taste
is
sort
of
fruity
with
a
chocolate
finish
chocolate
is
more
intense
when
colder
and
gives
way
to
the
fruit
as
it
warms
makes
me
wonder
if
it
was
more
chocolatey
when
younger
creamy
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
very
nice
beer
not
too
much
chocolate
well
balanced
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
could
do
with
a
more
chocolatey
and
less
well
basic
aroma
overall
though
a
tasty
beer
which
makes
a
good
sipper
if
this
used
to
be
chocolate
it
has
turned
into
raisinets
interesting
but
for
people
looking
to
try
this
in
its
original
form
you
may
already
be
too
late
this
is
a
nobrainer
with
dinner
and
would
easily
add
to
a
sirloin
steak
o
good
chocolate
beer
i
would
say
it
has
a
few
highlights
but
otherwise
pretty
standard
pours
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
decent
chocolate
with
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruits
a
little
bit
of
oxidation
too
sort
of
a
bland
aroma
overall
theres
a
good
chocolate
flavor
and
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toasted
bread
the
flavor
is
also
a
bit
of
oxidation
overall
just
kind
of
sweet
and
chocolatey
i
guess
thats
the
point
medium
body
and
carbonation
since
the
style
description
seems
to
be
a
catch
all
so
to
speak
there
is
no
sat
in
stone
parameters
this
easily
fits
within
the
loose
definition
the
sweet
and
malty
my
first
brew
of
this
style
me
likes
for
a
belgium
i
like
no
belgium
candied
sugar
flavor
detected
a
nice
sipper
id
do
this
again
with
no
hessitation
overall
a
really
well
done
chocolate
stout
it
is
just
a
shame
that
it
is
more
than
likely
the
last
time
i
will
ever
have
it
overall
incredibly
finished
and
not
hard
to
indulge
in
you
dont
need
to
be
a
heavy
beer
drinker
or
some
crazy
connoisseur
to
love
this
beer
cheers
to
all
and
merry
christmas
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
in
the
chocolate
category
i
would
put
this
at
the
top
o
i
think
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
love
the
chocolate
flavor
and
smooth
mouthfeel
o
a
great
brew
really
hits
the
spot
and
is
unique
for
the
style
o
very
nice
beer
very
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
buy
again
it
seems
to
be
stuck
in
the
middle
too
big
for
an
easy
drinking
stout
and
too
small
to
be
something
i
want
to
truly
savor
like
a
ris
the
chocolate
is
a
nice
touch
but
i
would
like
a
little
more
malt
character
i
am
starting
to
think
this
would
have
been
better
as
a
bda
with
chocolate
vs
a
chocolate
stout
o
ommegangs
chocolate
indulgence
stout
wasnt
nearly
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
as
it
was
on
tap
the
chocolate
feels
much
more
muted
and
pushed
to
the
back
as
a
role
player
in
the
end
this
is
an
average
beer
something
i
dont
feel
all
too
compelled
to
have
again
the
taste
is
extremely
sweet
and
rich
and
oh
so
good
i
would
compare
it
to
chocolate
covered
cherries
delicious
the
estery
taste
comes
through
immediately
as
does
the
chocolate
subtle
notes
of
candy
sugar
full
bodied
and
heavy
this
beer
is
worthy
of
the
name
indulgence
very
good
for
dessert
fullbodied
with
very
little
carbonation
this
is
a
thick
brew
very
heavy
i
would
only
recommend
it
as
a
dessert
beer
due
to
the
richness
of
it
very
yummy
i
do
wish
it
was
a
little
more
complex
but
for
what
it
offers
it
is
very
balanced
o
ive
got
a
feeling
i
know
why
this
beer
isnt
a
regular
release
its
a
little
hard
to
love
underneath
its
a
lovely
belgian
something
i
know
ommegang
can
do
well
however
its
overshadowed
by
a
hamhanded
attempt
at
chocolate
indulgence
too
bad
a
chocolate
belgian
stout
seems
like
a
decent
idea
o
very
nice
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
as
a
winter
warmer
or
having
it
with
a
particularly
rich
dessert
i
like
it
o
fantastic
and
criminally
underrated
highly
recommended
i
will
search
out
this
bittersweet
jewel
wherever
i
can
find
it
hurrah
for
ommegang
o
great
belgian
dark
ale
and
perfect
for
any
chocolate
lover
or
for
dessert
to
me
this
is
more
like
a
stout
then
anything
because
of
the
yeast
is
very
faint
the
first
time
i
had
it
it
was
slightly
sour
but
the
second
time
was
much
much
better
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
especially
for
people
who
doesnt
like
sweet
chocolate
flavor
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
airy
id
actually
call
it
fluffy
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
its
not
overly
heavy
its
not
overly
chocolatey
o
not
overly
complex
the
flavors
could
benefit
from
some
age
to
help
them
integrate
but
otherwise
a
solid
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
w
a
one
finger
chocolate
head
decent
carbonation
and
lacing
on
this
brew
smell
is
that
of
cocoa
powder
chocolate
malt
hops
and
very
faint
fruit
smell
is
not
balanced
and
a
little
of
a
disappointment
taste
is
a
little
better
but
still
not
enough
balance
or
malt
to
make
this
beer
really
top
notch
feel
is
fairly
smooth
w
a
little
hop
bite
in
the
background
overall
this
beer
has
been
hit
of
miss
for
me
the
recent
beers
ive
had
have
not
measured
up
to
the
ones
ive
had
several
years
ago
not
sure
whether
the
brew
has
changed
or
not
please
add
more
malt
only
one
question
remains
is
this
a
belgian
dark
ale
or
a
belgian
stout
o
ive
had
this
brew
about
a
dozen
times
and
it
never
fails
me
i
love
it
just
as
i
do
everything
that
ommegang
does
not
a
sweet
or
milk
stout
so
its
not
gonna
take
care
of
that
sweet
tooth
but
the
chocolate
just
lends
a
beautiful
harmony
that
mixes
with
the
belgian
flavors
that
this
brewery
is
so
well
known
for
overall
while
i
was
surprised
at
how
little
chocolate
flavor
was
in
a
beer
named
chocolate
indulgence
i
do
think
the
beer
is
quite
good
and
worth
a
try
but
again
if
you
buy
a
bottle
start
off
thinking
not
chocolate
but
black
stout
this
beer
is
quite
the
chocolate
treat
for
a
chocolate
lover
this
ones
a
great
pick
indulgence
pours
black
as
night
and
boasts
a
thick
creamy
chocolate
colored
head
the
head
slowly
dissipates
into
thick
lacing
that
sticks
around
to
the
last
sip
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
greet
you
on
the
smell
and
faint
hints
of
coffee
are
mixed
within
as
the
beer
warms
hints
of
alcohol
become
noticeable
on
the
nose
as
well
when
you
take
a
sip
you
notice
that
this
beer
is
definitely
chocolatey
but
not
all
that
sweet
some
bitter
notes
come
through
and
make
you
think
of
a
decadent
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
touches
of
coffee
are
also
present
and
help
round
this
beer
out
o
this
is
just
a
big
miss
in
my
book
ommegangs
worst
beer
by
a
long
way
i
had
tried
an
aged
bottle
before
and
though
my
dislike
was
due
to
that
fact
but
this
fresh
ontap
experience
was
no
better
this
is
a
really
great
dessert
beer
and
a
good
sipper
for
chilly
nights
cant
wait
to
have
one
for
those
few
days
of
winter
here
in
new
orleans
pours
black
with
a
huge
three
fingers
of
dark
sand
colored
foam
very
solid
retention
and
nice
sheeting
of
lacing
smells
is
a
big
bright
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
nuttiness
taste
is
crisp
dry
with
dark
chocolate
chocolate
malt
earthiness
and
some
burnt
smokiness
in
the
background
medium
carbonation
on
a
mediumlight
body
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
chocolate
bomb
given
the
name
but
this
was
still
a
pretty
solid
standard
stout
even
though
i
was
expecting
this
to
substitute
for
dessert
i
actually
think
the
dryness
would
complement
something
sweet
quite
well
o
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
beer
not
a
cloying
dessert
beer
sweet
but
still
refreshing
narrative
johnathon
chiu
had
never
been
allowed
sweets
as
a
boy
in
fact
his
father
specifically
noted
that
the
sweet
enzymes
in
eggplant
skins
had
more
than
enough
c6h1206
for
any
growing
boy
he
longed
for
the
sweet
succor
of
candy
but
was
systematically
denied
all
of
his
life
but
that
was
then
and
this
is
the
freshman
year
at
vassar
the
first
3
days
he
kept
a
cool
demeanor
around
the
buffet
and
ate
according
to
tradition
on
the
third
night
the
revelation
ensued
the
local
711
attendant
witnessed
the
raiding
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
diabetic
madman
johnathon
clutched
the
paper
bag
and
almost
sprinted
home
and
locked
the
door
scarcely
had
he
pulled
the
shades
when
he
dug
straight
into
rolos
and
sixlets
cascading
waves
of
joy
and
endorphins
snoballs
and
watchamacallits
the
whole
experience
just
hit
his
bloodstream
like
pure
heroin
his
roomate
walked
in
abruptly
and
found
johnathon
hunched
over
the
chocolate
gooey
mess
this
isnt
what
it
looks
like
b
johnathon
where
are
your
pants
its
possible
ommegang
used
unsweetened
chocolate
to
which
i
say
why
bother
unsweetened
chocolate
is
like
flat
beer
its
just
not
good
ive
also
had
this
on
draught
at
the
gingerman
in
ft
worth
in
early
2011
i
remember
the
chocolate
flavor
being
masked
a
bit
more
by
the
fact
that
it
came
out
of
a
keg
while
visiting
my
aunt
last
summer
in
rochester
ny
we
stopped
in
at
a
little
pub
called
the
old
toad
they
had
bottle
of
this
one
their
menu
and
after
searching
for
it
for
a
year
or
more
i
was
very
happy
to
see
they
had
some
in
stock
i
ordered
a
bottle
to
go
and
brought
it
home
with
me
opened
it
up
a
few
days
later
and
love
its
rich
black
pour
the
head
was
brown
a
foamy
the
smell
was
roasted
and
burnt
with
a
nose
full
of
belgian
dark
chocolate
and
some
yeast
the
taste
was
chocolatey
and
had
a
nice
transition
from
sweet
to
bitter
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thick
and
very
smooth
overall
i
was
very
glad
to
get
this
and
im
very
happy
that
it
was
as
enjoyable
as
i
expected
it
to
be
a
very
good
beer
all
around
in
my
opinion
d
oh
yea
more
please
possibly
with
aging
it
could
be
better
its
not
what
i
expected
but
its
pretty
good
its
a
very
drinkable
stout
not
overly
complex
but
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
the
addition
of
the
sweet
dark
fruit
flavor
is
excellent
the
beer
also
does
a
great
job
of
having
rich
and
bold
flavors
without
being
too
heavy
or
filling
pours
a
black
color
12
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dry
hop
slight
earthy
malt
slight
alcohol
and
slight
spice
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
roasted

opaque

with
some
noticeable
sediment
a
fine
thick

right
to
the
end
chocolate
and
rich
dark
malts
in
the
nose
with
some
dark
fruits
big
chocolate
taste
with
roasty
malts
cherries
and
raisins
earthy
and
bready
fullbodied
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
would
not
buy
or
suggest
this
beer
to
anyone
there
is
obviously
some
chocolate
in
this
beer
but
its
really
no
different
than
a
stout
or
even
a
slightly
bitter
porter
the
name
doesnt
really
fit
despite
that
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
your
every
day
beer
very
interesting
beer
seemingly
tough
to
categorize
id
have
guessed
a
stout
but
here
i
see
its
listed
as
belgian
dark
pours
black
with
a
nice
chocolate
brown
head
well
retained
lacing
the
glass
well
the
smell
is
strong
chocolate
and
hoppy
the
taste
is
something
very
different
you
get
a
lot
of
dark
chocolate
this
beer
is
much
more
bitter
than
its
name
and
appearance
would
lead
one
to
expect
very
hoppy
and
roasty
light
chocolate
sweetness
to
balance
it
a
bit
very
interesting
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
o
drinkability
is
good
its
a
pretty
good
beer
in
general
but
im
not
sure
how
much
the
chocolate
adds
to
an
otherwise
solid
begian
style
beer
overall
what
we
found
to
be
the
strongest
point
of
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
outrageously
smooth
and
slick
easily
gliding
around
the
mouth
on
an
interesting
note
it
was
unexpected
to
have
such
a
strong
yeast
characteristic
even
more
so
that
it
was
so
belgian
seeming
it
was
certainly
a
nice
aspect
to
keep
this
beer
unique
this
is
chocolate
milk
for
grownups
with
a
huge
chocolate
profile
showing
us
what
true
indulgence
really
is
o
quite
drinkable
but
not
good
enough
to
be
a
top
pick
from
the
corked
25
ml
bottle
packaged
on
102210
and
best
by
102012
sampled
on
april
25
2011
it
pours
black
as
night
with
a
delicate
tan
head
that
lingers
up
top
dark
chocolate
is
just
the
beginning
of
the
wide
array
of
aromas
which
include
sweet
malts
yeast
and
a
red
grape
winelike
sensation
the
smooth
but
bold
body
tickles
my
tongue
with
a
cornucorpia
of
chocolates
malts
pepper
and
yeast
which
yields
a
slight
but
noted
dry
finale
i
guess
i
liked
it
better
than
a
majority
of
the
previous
reviewers
a
super
easy
drink
easily
an
all
nighter
easy
going
tasty
beautiful
and
well
put
together
no
doubt
one
that
i
will
pick
up
again
i
love
these
chocolate
beers
o
it
lived
up
to
its
chocolate
and
cocao
on
the
label
this
is
a
stand
alone
ale
unless
you
wanted
to
do
a
black
and
tan
with
a
fruity
lambic
as
suggested
by
the
young
man
that
sold
it
to
me
i
was
thinking
this
is
a
dessert
a
25
oz
bottle
could
go
well
with
4
friends
sharing
it
after
a
nice
light
supper
of
seafood
dits
difficult
to
figure
out
exactly
what
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
stout
or
a
belgian
dark
ale
it
definitely
fits
well
between
the
two
but
id
consider
this
as
a
foreign
export
stout
more
than
anything
ommegang
really
tricked
me
with
the
yummy
sounding
name
but
the
beer
didnt
live
up
to
the
price
tag
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
im
starting
to
enjoy
it
and
appreciate
its
uniqueness
value
though
i
had
this
in
the
past
and
wasnt
blown
away
but
maybe
some
age
did
this
brew
some
good
as
im
much
more
impressed
this
time
around
the
chocolate
comes
through
very
well
and
makes
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
good
stuff
overall
an
incredibly
superb
tasting
stout
definitely
work
having
another
the
price
doesnt
match
the
beer
i
know
the
cage
and
cork
just
make
people
open
their
wallets
but
sorry
at
around
13
bucks
i
want
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
from
a
7
abv
beer
especially
this
seems
like
a
pretty
simple
stout
an
odd
example
of
a
beer
that
is
not
as
good
as
the
sum
of
its
parts
drinkability
there
is
a
lot
to
love
about
this
beer
a
complexities
and
drinkability
a
glass
of
chocolate
indulgence
would
be
a
great
accompaniment
to
the
holidays
or
a
dessert
o
despite
being
a
particularly
pricey
item
this
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
overall
a
good
stout
which
i
would
buy
again
at
any
time
overall
though
i
still
felt
this
was
alright
interesting
take
on
this
beer
ommegang
chocolate
indulgence
stout
has
a
black
colour
and
a
3
mm
tan
head
that
lasts
a
little
while
and
is
replaced
by
good
lacing
the
smell
is
fresh
is
that
hops
and
roasty
malt
that
has
some
chocolate
character
to
it
there
are
lots
of
hops
up
front
as
well
as
some
malty
chocolate
the
alcohol
is
fairly
noticeable
which
is
strange
in
a
7
beer
the
aftertaste
is
roasty
malt
and
slightly
bitter
reminiscent
of
dark
chocolate
this
beer
is
very
foamy
and
full
in
its
texture
overall
a
nice
chocolate
stout
but
far
too
hoppy
for
this
style
imho
pours
dark
with
thick
creamy
light
brown
foam
loads
of
lacing
dark
espresso
smell
dark
chocolate
rich
roasted
belgian
yeast
taste
under
a
dark
roasted
malt
taste
dark
fruit
full
of
flavor
bursts
forth
great
beer
easy
to
drink
yet
so
much
happening
concluding
thoughts
amazing
if
you
want
a
chocolate
beer
this
one
will
not
disappoint
at
7
abv
its
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
overall
the
bitterdry
chocolate
is
very
nice
not
overbearing
the
lack
of
sweetness
improves
overall
drinkability
for
me
not
something
i
would
seek
out
often
but
enjoyable
overall
tasty
although
the
flavor
of
unsweetened
chocolate
in
this
beer
isnt
really
for
me
the
bitter
aftertaste
is
a
bit
overwhelming
and
made
this
beer
a
little
bit
of
a
struggle
to
finish
the
cpj
drinkability
this
is
a
fine
ale
it
goes
down
quite
easy
and
i
think
if
it
would
have
had
a
higher
alcohol
content
it
would
have
floundered
good
beer
better
chocolate
stouts
but
nice
on
a
cold
evening
drinkability
lite
and
smooth
the
beer
is
easy
to
consume
but
lacks
enough
interest
for
the
price
i
mean
come
on
the
label
makes
a
point
of
mentioning
its
brewed
with
belgian
chocolate
one
would
think
you
would
get
an
interesting
flavor
is
a
hint
more
than
a
prevalent
taste
medium
thick
feel
on
the
tongue
with
a
decent
stick
on
the
finish
good
for
one
bomber
d
this
beer
is
a
slow
sipper
because
of
the
bitterness
and
dryness
the
presence
of
sweetness
and
creaminess
would
have
made
this
a
lot
more
quaffable
appears
with
a
pitch
black
body
tan
foamin
head
billowing
thick
with
chunky
sporadic
lacing
coating
my
unibroue
la
fin
du
monde
chalice
aroma
has
dark
chocolate
herbal
hops
with
not
much
else
going
on
the
chocolate
doesnt
seem
real
creamy
more
of
a
dark
powdered
chocolate
flavor
has
a
sharp
acidity
from
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
additions
some
nice
balance
from
the
herbal
hops
in
the
background
definitely
not
a
dessert
beer
i
was
picturing
sweet
super
chocolate
decadence
however
it
was
a
nice
quaffable
dark
belgian
style
dry
dark
chocolate
infused
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
somewhat
astringent
with
bitterness
off
the
dark
chocolatedark
roasted

carbonation
is
nice
lively
somewhat
effervescent
mouthfeel
was
smooth
drinkability
was
decent
nothing
too
sweet
or
candy
bar
milk
chocolate
about
it
more
like
dark
organic
cocoa
powder
my
wife
was
a
bit
disappointed
that
it
wasnt
a
chick
dessert
beer
d
although
it
is
tasty
and
very
drinkable
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
much
more
than
a
bomber
of
this
the
carbonation
is
just
too
overwhelming
for
my
palate
share
with
a
friend
served
to
me
in
a
12oz
tulip
dark
brown
almost
black
capped
nicely
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
nose
is
pleasantly
complex
cocoa
beans
and
ripe
fruit
the
palate
is
full
of
flavor
rich
chocolate
soft
earthy
notes
and
a
healthy
dose
of
fruity
esters
problem
is
these
flavors
never
really
mesh
which
is
a
shame
because
this
brew
has
potential
to
be
great
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
and
fluid
in
short
this
is
a
very
unique
and
interesting
ale
and
is
worth
a
taste
opinion
well
i
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
even
played
it
up
for
my
wife
she
agreed
without
my
prompting
that
it
was
mediocre
at
best
i
mean
when
you
stand
it
up
to
budweisers
bare
knuckle
stout
it
blows
it
away
but
even
standing
next
to
harpoons
chocolate
stout
it
pales
in
comparison
this
one
concentrates
more
on
the
belgium
than
either
the
stout
or
the
chocolate
in
all
honesty
it
seems
like
a
beer
dubbel
or
something
that
got
away
from
them
that
they
are
trying
to
recoup
by
adding
some
flavor
into
it
i
dont
know
it
seems
off
and
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
brings
forward
some
dark
fruits
paired
decently
enough
with
a
strong
dose
of
dark
chocolate
some
roasted
malt
there
as
well
the
flavor
falls
along
the
same
linesthere
is
some
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
though
nothing
is
terribly
interesting
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
dryness
in
the
finish
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
some
very
nice
flavors
to
it
i
found
it
pretty
well
balanced
between
the
chocolate
and
the
bitter
roasty
flavors
which
helped
the
drinkability
for
me
pretty
solid
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
had
suspected
to
be
a
dessert
beer
chocolate
indulgence
is
however
a
beer
for
any
occasion
i
enjoyed
this
on
tap
at
the
black
dog
in
urbana
il
and
point
you
to
my
review
in
beerfly
great
bbq
and
fantastic
beer
finish
is
simple
light
bitter
grapefruit
skin
i
need
not
try
this
one
again
d
based
on
the
name
you
would
think
this
beer
is
bursting
with
chocolate
flavor
youd
be
mistaken
there
is
a
very
subtle
chocolate
presence
in
this
beer
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
in
general
but
the
lack
of
chocolate
with
a
name
like
chocolate
indulgence
makes
it
lackluster
t
do
not
detect
the
chocolate
as
advertised
in
the
name
taste
follows
the
smell
with
little
complexity
afterwards
d
a
mediocre
beer
and
a
disappointment
from
an
otherwise
solid
brewery
poured
into
a
ommegang
chalice
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
good
head
retention
and
lacing
theres
not
much
that
i
find
on
the
nose
other
than
a
malted
scent
no
expected
cocoa
scent
the
taste
isnt
all
that
exciting
either
there
are
cocoa
notes
that
isnt
all
that
strong
for
this
to
be
a
belgian
there
isnt
any
belgian
yeast
pressence
its
not
strong
enough
to
be
considered
a
stout
either
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
at
a
good
level
the
lower
alcohol
and
body
of
this
actually
makes
it
rather
drinkable
but
not
worth
its
limited
availabilty
this
is
a
nice
dessert
beer
decadent
and
wellmade
d
its
weird
not
assertive
enough
to
be
a
good
dark
ale
but
way
lacking
almost
all
the
good
aspects
of
a
stout
yeah
the
appearance
is
great
but
it
pretty
much
ends
there
taste
falls
incredibly
flat
wheres
the
big
chocolate
notes
not
in
this
beer
thats
for
sure
and
if
you
like
me
buy
this
looking
for
the
chocolate
you
will
more
likely
than
not
be
sorely
dissappointed
poured
deep
brown
with
nice
ruby
hues
in
the
light
light
beige
head
that
lasted
an
impressive
length
of
time
adorning
the
oversized
wine
glass
with
bands
of
lacing
the
aromas
explode
chocolate
belgian
dark
chocolate
cocoa
hint
of
dark
toast
and
the
faintest
hint
of
raisins
the
cocoa
is
more
pronounced
than
the
rest
chocolate
is
the
highlight
of
the
flavors
although
it
is
balanced
well
by
slight
caramel
touch
of
raisins
and
plums
and
cream
a
toasty
and
sweetish
finish
makes
for
a
great
dessert
beer
indeed
this
went
very
well
with
pumpkin
pie
apple
pie
and
cheesecake
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
expected
yet
not
quite
in
the
ris
range
of
course
this
is
a
belgian
style
beer
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
and
before
long
we
were
sad
that
our
glasses
were
empty
this
bottle
is
at
least
a
year
old
up
to
two
years
so
i
dont
know
if
this
has
made
much
of
a
difference
probably
has
had
this
at
an
ommegangduvel
beer
tasting
and
was
really
looking
for
to
this
one
i
was
disappointed
to
find
that
this
beer
smelled
like
used
wet
cigarettes
and
tasted
the
same
the
mouth
feel
seemed
thin
for
a
stout
glad
i
had
it
at
a
beer
tasting
so
i
know
not
to
buy
it
drinkability
if
i
wanted
to
i
could
probably
name
five
beers
more
chocolaty
than
this
after
my
first
glass
i
already
have
a
headache
this
is
strike
one
against
chocolate
indulgence
but
i
would
definitely
try
another
bottle
for
comparison
d
nice
to
sip
on
without
knowing
the
name
the
chocolate
wasnt
all
that
prevalent
price
9
99
at
witherspoon
wine
jd
another
very
nice
brew
from
brewery
ommegang
i
had
this
a
while
back
this
is
my
first
review
however
and
i
have
to
admit
was
a
bit
surprised
with
this
the
flavors
seem
to
be
flirting
with
me
they
are
all
there
but
unfortuntely
they
ae
somewhat
muted
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
very
good
brew
but
may
be
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
definitely
worthy
but
there
are
other
ways
to
indulge
the
senses
d
with
a
name
like
chocolate
indulgence
d
i
know
what
i
wont
be
getting
another
bottle
of
i
love
ommegang
brew
but
honestly
i
havent
been
this
dissapointed
in
a
long
time
if
you
wanna
share
it
with
some
beer
loving
friends
go
ahead
but
youve
been
warned
d
one
glass
and
im
done
with
this
one
think
of
a
cold
beer
adaption
of
hot
cocoa
but
this
is
very
filling
and
one
glass
is
enough
in
a
sitting
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
large
creamy
hazle
brown
colored
head
the
smell
was
a
bit
weak
and
the
aroma
was
moslty
of
chocholate
the
inital
taste
was
of
a
typical
dry
stout
and
as
more
of
the
beer
was
consumed
the
stonger
chochlate
flavors
mixing
in
with
the
stout
like
flavors
made
itselt
present
a
nice
beer
to
sip
but
not
hard
to
drink
overall
i
find
chocolate
beers
trickey
but
this
one
was
very
good
there
isnt
much
to
indicate
this
beers
belgian
heritage
except
a
hint
of
funktang
about
34
of
the
way
in
any
more
and
i
dont
think
it
would
work
very
good
but
ill
have
to
see
if
i
could
finish
one
myself
reminiscient
of
the
rogue
chocolate
stout
but
the
chocolate
is
less
strong
here
but
no
less
good
its
a
comfortable
easy
going
stout
mixed
in
with
some
nice
smooth
not
over
the
top
chocolate
accompaniment
i
enjoyed
it
it
wasnt
heavy
on
any
particular
aspect
but
i
couldnt
really
detect
anything
particularly
belgian
tasting
about
the
yeast
only
the
sweetness
and
the
dark
fruit
thing
ever
so
nuanaced
lighter
body
due
to
the
higher
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
tasty
overall
average
beer
did
not
live
up
to
its
name
of
chocolate
indulgence
i
would
drink
it
again
if
opportunity
presented
itself
but
probably
wont
buy
another
bottle
a
solid
blackbrown
color
opaque
and
topped
with
a
massive
light
brown
colored
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
thick
chocolate
malt
and
bacon
wow
delicious
smelling
the
flavor
follows
with
chocolate
pumpernickel
and
grapey
highlights
its
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
somewhat
silky
in
feel
i
pick
up
a
bit
of
coffee
bitterness
plenty
drinkable
for
a
heavier
brew
and
very
tastey
nice
cheers
nice
to
see
something
like
this
ontap
round
here
it
pours
a
straight
onyx
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
brown
foam
the
nose
comprises
a
heapin
helpin
o
dark
chocolate
along
with
some
roasted
malts
light
coffee
molasses
and
caramelized
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
with
notes
of
chocolate
powder
a
good
amount
of
coffee
some
brown
sugar
cinnamon
black
pepper
and
roasted
malts
the
body
is
a
somewhat
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
very
good
brew
though
a
bit
light
for
my
tastes
were
it
a
tad
heavier
and
thicker
it
would
be
nearly
perfect
this
beer
pours
a
darkness
covered
in
a
light
beige
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
raisins
sweet
raisinettes
the
taste
has
the
same
chocolate
raisin
taste
to
it
but
there
are
a
couple
of
guests
that
show
up
to
this
party
bourbon
and
oak
make
this
beer
really
pleasant
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
general
velvety
texture
to
it
that
is
out
of
this
world
even
with
the
booze
there
i
would
have
no
problem
having
this
beer
again
it
is
a
wonderful
pleasant
tasting
beer
overall
its
a
great
beer
but
probably
my
least
favorite
of
my
ommegang
samples
so
far
im
not
saying
thats
a
bad
beer
but
for
a
beer
of
this
price
and
reputation
i
was
expecting
it
to
differentiate
itself
a
little
more
d
it
was
a
pleasure
to
split
the
bottle
with
my
dad
as
its
meant
to
be
shared
with
others
the
7
abv
is
tame
yet
adds
a
warming
quality
and
fullness
to
the
brew
a
tad
sticky
sweet
this
brew
might
be
best
served
with
mellow
cheeses
tart
fruits
or
simply
on
its
own
very
nice
overall
few
stouts
are
session
beers
and
although
the
abv
will
prohibit
mass
consumption
i
could
down
this
a
lot
faster
than
other
belgian
dark
alesstouts
great
flavor
wellrounded
a
nontypical
belgian
inspired
brew
not
very
drinkable
really
and
particularly
not
when
i
was
hoping
for
a
belgian
style
first
impressions
were
good
and
it
finished
strong
there
is
cocoa
at
the
end
of
every
gulp
and
i
appreciate
the
added
complexity
the
chocolate
gives
i
would
like
to
drink
again
but
price
is
a
little
bit
high
overall
good
belgian
style
chocolate
stout
drinkability
not
too
shabby
d
very
low
its
heavy
in
every
way
the
single
bottle
was
too
much
for
me
dit
is
a
very
rich
beer
that
i
can
enjoy
at
about
10oz
at
a
time
very
nice
beer
from
a
stellar
brewery
all
things
told
it
succeeds
the
beer
pours
a
rich
black
brown
with
a
vigorous
tan
head
and
lacing
like
you
wouldnt
believe
ive
now
finished
the
beer
and
the
entire
glass
is
well
laced
smells
like
a
typical
belgian
dark
with
little
suggestion
of
the
chocolate
in
the
brew
the
beer
tastes
very
nice
however
coming
off
as
a
bittersweet
coco
mixed
with
something
along
the
lines
of
a
dubble
or
tripple
tasty
and
is
a
treat
when
the
weather
starts
to
turn
but
not
the
most
drinkable
of
beers
for
more
than
a
pint
pours
a
deep
brown
colour
with
tan
head
head
starts
off
thick
but
even
as
it
dissipates
it
leaves
a
nice
layer
with
lacing
on
the
side
smell
is
of
bitter
chocolate
mild
roasted
malt
and
some
belgian
yeast
flavour
is
sweet
with
chocolate
roast
mouthfeel
is
thin
compared
to
stouts
but
thick
compared
to
belgian
ales
which
seems
to
make
sense
given
the
style
a
very
nice
beer
d
slightly
sweet
and
mildly
bitter
a
solid
if
not
terribly
impressive
stout
that
being
said
not
every
beer
should
be
big
and
menacing
this
is
a
great
beer
to
accompany
a
wide
range
of
meals
with
and
is
also
perfect
to
use
to
introduce
newbies
to
the
word
of
chocolate
stouts
it
is
lightly
effervescent
and
is
probably
more
so
when
fresh
but
smooth
with
soft
cocoa
and
roast
flavors
and
an
easy
finish
without
much
bitterness
this
is
the
perfect
equation
to
start
off
with
into
a
world
of
typically
potent
beers
definitely
a
good
cocoa
beer
and
definitely
a
different
style
from
ommegangs
regular
fare
its
worth
a
try
sometime
drinks
like
false
advertising
while
a
good
beer
chocolate
indulgence
is
neither
as
chocolatey
nor
as
indulgent
as
id
hope
and
definitely
not
worth
the
12
price
tag
i
paid
for
it
i
used
the
first
bit
of
the
bottle
in
a
brownie
recipe
which
turned
out
excellent
and
may
be
a
far
better
utilization
of
this
beer
this
would
probably
be
better
with
age
this
stout
is
as
you
would
expect
it
to
be
chocolately
this
is
an
ok
beer
very
much
onenote
that
note
is
chocolate
a
whole
750
would
be
too
much
for
me
pair
this
with
a
smores
poptart
for
best
results
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
maintains
nice
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
coffee
alcohol
and
subtle
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
caramel
coffee
and
chocolate
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
nice
chocolate
stout
the
subtle
flavor
notes
were
nice
and
not
overwhelming
so
you
could
pick
out
some
more
of
the
flavors
in
the
brew
the
aroma
was
lacking
however
and
could
be
improved
on
to
make
it
more
complex
glad
i
finally
got
the
chance
to
drink
this
one
after
so
long
drinkability
awesome
belgian
dark
not
heaby
on
the
hocolate
as
expected
and
not
quite
as
sweet
d
a
very
good
belgian
ale
a
terrible
chocolate
flavoured
ale
beer
poured
black
as
night
with
a
large
brown
head
that
is
leaving
lacing
all
over
my
tulip
glass
nose
is
cocoa
hints
of
belgian
yeast
and
coffee
taste
is
big
on
the
cocoa
without
being
overly
sweet
with
a
nice
hint
of
coffee
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
classic
belgian
yeast
strain
very
smooth
but
yet
on
the
light
side
it
seems
slightly
off
drinkabilty
is
good
i
suspect
this
has
improved
with
age
it
was
nice
to
induldge
on
this
would
try
again
to
see
how
it
has
changed
after
drinking
quite
a
few
russian
imperial
stouts
lately
having
one
that
is
only
7
abv
was
refreshing
the
flavors
of
this
beer
are
wellsuited
for
a
stout
and
this
would
make
a
nice
dessert
beer
with
some
tiramisu
or
even
used
in
the
tiramisu
instead
of
espresso
i
will
be
using
the
rest
for
a
beer
float
the
taste
follows
on
the
from
the
nose
with
a
deliciously
dry
finish
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
better
but
im
not
complaining
too
much
about
that
this
would
be
a
wonderful
beer
to
pair
with
a
powerful
curry
i
think
very
nice
indeed
this
is
a
pretty
unique
beer
that
is
worth
trying
but
not
something
i
would
reach
for
on
a
regular
basis
pours
a
black
with
a
small
toffee
colored
head
that
left
lacing
all
down
the
snifter
the
smell
is
strong
of
dark
fruits
cherry
mostly
with
a
lot
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
very
similar
only
with
more
dark
chocolate
and
less
dark
fruits
i
get
a
very
pleasant
woodieness
to
it
as
well
not
overly
sweet
at
all
very
slight
notices
of
booze
as
it
goes
down
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
dry
finish
theres
a
reason
so
many
reviews
of
this
use
dusty
thinnish
body
but
it
only
aids
in
the
immense
drinkability
of
this
beer
it
manages
to
be
both
dessert
like
at
a
meager
7
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
would
also
be
lovely
with
a
rich
dessert
the
dry
cocoa
would
cut
the
sweetness
this
is
a
superb
creation
not
sure
how
the
age
affected
it
because
ive
not
had
it
fresh
but
at
this
point
i
am
ready
to
stock
up
the
cellar
and
make
sure
i
have
more
of
this
around
definitely
a
sipper
but
works
great
as
just
that
this
would
pair
really
well
with
all
kinds
of
desserts
or
would
even
work
as
a
dessert
itself
wonderful
quaff
and
a
decent
sipping
beer
for
any
post
meal
session
the
indulgence
stout
pours
a
midnight
black
color
and
a
nice
tan
frothy
head
bubbles
over
the
edge
of
the
glass
very
good
retention
that
leaves
a
small
mustache
with
each
sip
nose
is
mostly
burnt
coffee
with
some
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
with
chocolate
not
much
coffee
is
noticed
on
the
palate
other
tastes
are
roasted
malts
and
some
syrup
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
semisweet
drinkability
is
mediocre
not
as
much
chocolate
as
i
was
expecting
but
this
could
have
mellowed
out
with
the
1
year
in
the
cellar
d
drinkable
but
not
something
id
care
to
drink
substantial
amounts
of
did
go
well
with
some
chocolate
chip
cookies
it
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
faintly
of
chocolate
but
otherwise
like
that
of
a
normal
stout
it
has
a
very
slight
chocolate
taste
not
as
strong
as
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
lighter
stout
nowhere
near
as
heavy
feeling
as
guinness
or
other
staple
stouts
there
is
almost
no
hoppiness
to
the
beer
at
all
making
it
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
am
surprised
that
there
isnt
more
of
a
belgian
yeastiness
in
this
belgian
dark
ale
there
is
plenty
of
mouthfeel
and
creaminess
but
it
is
slightly
lacking
in
the
overall
malt
bill
i
would
enjoy
just
a
little
more
punch
it
is
possible
that
this
is
exactly
the
point
of
the
chocolate
indulgence
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
thought
it
was
perfect
for
desert
bottle
date
of
101909
with
a
best
by
date
of
102012
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
more
than
2
fingers
of
a
mocha
colored
head
aroma
is
mostly
chocolate
powder
serious
amount
of
lace
clings
to
the
glass
in
a
solid
layer
like
a
curtain
from
the
slow
head
recession
chocolate
completely
dominates
the
nose
with
a
faint
hint
of
citrus
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
chocolatey
with
a
slight
bitterness
upfront
and
finishes
with
some
alcohol
character
thin
body
with
low
carb
lingering
taste
of
chocolate
is
left
in
the
mouth
the
taste
is
a
nice
sweet
coffee
and
chocolate
toasted
and
roasted
malts
its
liquid
chocolate
a
nice
thick
but
smooth
mouthfeel
with
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
it
kept
my
mouth
wanting
for
more
i
wish
id
grabbed
two
bottles
instead
of
just
the
one
pours
a
rich
dark
nearblack
with
minimal
ring
of
brownish
head
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
grains
with
faint
hints
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
belgian
yeasts
taste
follows
scent
which
is
disapointing
because
the
namce
says
chocolate
mostly
roasted
malts
on
this
one
the
belgian
yeasts
add
an
interesting
taste
along
with
the
burnt
malts
body
is
medium
dry
and
chalky
not
impressed
almost
a
weak
version
of
brooklyn
black
chocolate
notes
its
nice
to
see
ommegang
trying
these
brews
and
its
quality
as
always
although
the
belgium
obsession
may
be
hurting
them
a
bit
here
a
true
belgium
stout
says
the
label
and
sure
enough
there
is
a
yeasty
and
chocolaty
belgium
hint
but
being
able
to
brew
stuff
of
this
quality
the
ale
does
not
need
any
justification
and
this
one
feels
like
it
lingers
on
its
own
compromises
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
light
brown
3
finger
head
a
little
lacing
is
left
behind
paid
25
for
this
beer
and
it
totally
wasnt
worth
it
maybe
had
i
not
had
southern
tier
choklat
two
days
ago
my
review
would
be
different
but
this
just
isnt
on
that
level
while
i
enjoyed
the
beer
all
i
could
think
about
was
i
wish
this
was
a
choklat
instead
a
little
dark
chocolate
and
mostly
roasted
malts
complete
the
taste
id
try
again
if
given
to
me
but
def
wouldnt
spend
another
25
beans
on
it
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
brown
head
smells
of
dark
chocolates
and
a
hint
of
sourness
taste
is
estery
and
light
up
front
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
finish
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
would
get
this
again
verdict
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
chocolate
indulgence
is
not
the
rich
and
chocolaty
belgiantinged
treat
i
was
hoping
for
instead
this
is
essentially
a
milk
stout
with
a
wellhidden
alcohol
boost
drinkability
misunderstood
by
some
around
here
who
seem
to
be
expecting
a
southern
tier
style
stout
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
it
lacks
a
little
complexity
in
the
final
analysis
poured
a
dark
brown
with
good
carbonation
and
a
dirty
tannish
head
nose
is
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
very
good
with
hints
of
bakers
chcocolate
and
milk
cocoa
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
was
good
and
drinkability
the
same
this
is
a
fine
chocolate
stout
that
i
could
drink
over
and
over
this
is
a
beer
all
its
own
dont
know
that
a
particular
style
suits
it
but
it
definitely
has
its
place
d
poor
misleading
beer
not
very
stoutish
and
too
much
hops
for
me
even
if
it
was
a
real
stout
didnt
sense
any
real
chocolate
and
certainly
nothing
close
to
indulgence
in
its
watery
taste
what
a
disappointment
this
was
d
this
goes
down
very
easy
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
couple
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
couple
of
hours
all
around
this
beer
is
another
ommegang
product
that
doesnt
disappoint
great
flavor
wellrounded
a
nontypical
belgian
inspired
craft
beer
will
drink
again
distinctive
nose
of
cocoa
and
malt
tastey
ale
coffee
and
a
pleasant
cocoa
bitterness
lightly
carbonated
so
despite
the
richness
of
this
ale
very
drinkable
overall
a
nice
brew
falls
short
of
amazing
pairs
well
with
berries
overall
massive
beer
good
experience
wouldnt
drink
it
regularly
i
think
the
beer
would
be
complimented
by
a
little
more
creaminess
and
less
carbonation
but
it
is
decent
as
it
is
it
fairly
drinkable
and
the
rich
flavors
didnt
wear
me
out
and
i
had
no
problem
quickly
finishing
the
whole
bottle
a
full
body
with
an
aggressive
somewhat
crisp
mouthfeel
not
quite
smooth
enough
to
be
creamy
i
thought
they
nailed
the
chocolate
addition
in
this
beer
i
expected
a
sweet
chocolate
bomb
but
was
surprised
when
i
got
a
dry
somewhat
bitter
dark
chocolate
flavor
like
an
imperial
stout
would
have
i
felt
this
beer
combines
the
smooth
and
mellow
characteristics
of
an
aged
stout
with
the
more
aggressive
hops
and
mouthfeel
of
a
fresher
one
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
pours
a
thick
and
hearty
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
dark
tan
thick
head
this
beer
produces
id
say
average
lacing
to
it
smell
is
very
nice
very
sweet
perfect
to
pair
with
dessert
or
even
have
for
dessert
smell
of
chocolate
but
not
overly
chocolaty
it
almost
smells
like
a
chocolate
flavored
liquorish
if
that
makes
any
sense
at
all
coffee
aroma
hints
maybe
even
more
of
an
espresso
scent
its
extremely
well
balanced
aroma
taste
is
also
very
nice
tastes
of
blended
dark
rich
chocolate
and
nuances
of
coffeeespresso
its
very
rich
and
sweet
almost
like
it
should
be
a
cake
i
guess
it
could
be
the
yeast
playing
that
role
there
is
also
an
aftertaste
of
a
little
bit
of
hop
it
burps
up
a
little
all
in
all
its
a
very
well
balanced
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
full
bodied
smooth
and
rich
with
a
perfect
carbonation
level
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
perfect
sipper
md
middle
of
the
road
carbonation
nicely
places
itself
between
a
traditional
blegian
and
a
traditional
stout
silky
finish
with
some
malty
dryness
that
may
be
augmented
by
the
cocoa
slightly
heavy
and
a
bit
warm
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
as
stated
before
the
spice
and
chocolate
work
nicely
together
despite
the
lower
level
of
chocolate
that
expected
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
big
brown
head
with
decent
retention
but
nothing
amazing
smells
of
chocolate
malt
cocoa
and
some
common
belgian
spiciness
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
i
had
heard
its
like
a
laidback
youngs
double
chocolate
with
some
clove
and
cinnamonlike
spice
mouthfeel
is
this
and
bubbly
pretty
drinkable
the
taste
wasnt
amazing
but
a
750
is
fine
for
one
person
overall
this
beer
did
not
give
me
what
i
expected
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
chocolate
flavor
and
not
such
burntness
i
was
expecting
a
chocolate
covered
raisins
or
prunes
but
just
tastes
like
kissing
a
smoker
i
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
d
great
brew
by
ommegang
but
i
wouldnt
say
that
the
taste
suits
the
name
well
o
full
complex
dark
with
burn
but
balanced
fantastic
smooth
stout
darker
than
my
taste
but
a
very
good
belgian
stout
d
this
beer
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
anticipated
and
the
chocolate
is
very
subtle
it
pairs
very
well
with
dark
chocolate
and
chocolate
dessert
but
alone
its
alittle
disappointing
given
the
high
price
of
this
its
hard
to
justify
buying
more
than
one
a
season
though
its
still
a
fantastic
beer
the
taste
is
a
bit
complex
with
lots
going
on
the
key
is
to
let
the
beer
settle
in
a
bit
the
beer
is
definitely
creamy
and
some
of
the
sharper
metallic
yeastiness
that
other
reviewers
commented
on
seems
to
fade
a
bit
as
things
settle
in
the
dark
malts
the
chocolate
the
creaminess
and
the
tangy
yeastiness
define
this
beer
there
is
a
slight
booziness
lurking
underneath
there
is
some
leafy
hop
popping
through
that
dries
this
beer
out
in
parts
there
is
some
metallic
and
tinny
flavors
that
do
detract
somewhat
there
is
a
raw
yeastiness
to
the
beer
that
detracts
as
well
the
chocolate
and
bittering
dark
malts
are
quite
nice
blend
nicely
with
the
thick
creaminess
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
pronounced
it
is
a
bit
oily
a
bit
prickly
drying
and
biting
a
bit
the
aftertaste
is
about
right
enough
to
let
you
know
youve
had
a
substantial
stout
not
too
lingering
though
there
is
a
touch
of
the
boozy
imperial
type
stout
in
this
beer
and
im
less
enamored
with
that
part
of
the
beer
overall
it
is
a
nice
beer
not
brilliant
but
quite
enjoyable
it
is
highly
drinkable
for
both
sweeter
beer
lovers
and
those
liking
more
robust
coffee
like
flavors
i
really
missed
this
beer
and
was
so
excited
to
have
it
again
although
this
time
i
was
disappointed
with
the
tinny
metallic
taste
better
luck
next
time
cant
wait
to
rereview
it
thanks
to
the
mill
tavern
in
montoursville
pa
for
putting
this
on
tap
a
nice
winter
treat
d
drinkable
needs
a
good
pairing
though
perhaps
something
fruity
cheers
this
is
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
another
great
brew
by
ommegang
but
should
be
priced
a
bit
better
this
is
a
7
0abv
beer
but
it
drinks
like
its
only
about
4
0
very
easy
to
consume
im
glad
that
ommegang
is
finally
available
in
oklahoma
as
i
think
that
they
produce
some
damn
fine
beers
this
is
certainly
one
of
them
pours
jet
black
and
completely
opaque
beautiful
pillowy
tan
head
smells
very
roasty
with
a
lot
of
yeast
in
there
as
well
also
some
subtle
hints
of
dark
chocolate
mmm
wonderfully
roasty
and
toasty
stout
taste
roasted
malt
and
coffee
bean
flavors
dominate
but
there
are
hints
of
bitter
cocoa
in
the
background
also
seems
to
have
a
slight
mustiness
to
the
flavor
that
may
be
the
yeast
strain
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
smooth
if
a
little
bit
sticky
at
the
end
i
find
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
granted
it
is
a
bit
rich
but
it
has
a
nice
smoothness
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
a
nice
surprise
that
came
with
my
ommegang
gift
set
and
a
beer
i
may
not
have
tried
otherwise
d
not
overbearing
not
as
chocolately
as
i
had
hoped
but
i
did
like
the
aniseclove
finish
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
interesting
a
nice
depth
of
chocolate
flavors
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
a
two
finger
caramelmocha
head
a
swirl
of
the
glass
leaves
good
lacing
rich
roasted
malt
flavors
and
bittersweet
chocolates
alcohol
is
present
on
the
finish
but
not
unpleasant
medium
body
allinall
really
drinkable
for
the
style
heavy
enough
to
remind
you
its
a
stout
but
not
so
much
that
the
entire
glass
makes
you
miserable
didnt
get
the
belgium
twist
that
i
expected
from
ommegang
but
still
a
great
brew
mediumbodied
no
grain
from
the
sedimentyeast
i
did
pour
carefully
but
yeah
its
easily
drinkable
and
not
too
heavy
into
a
snifter
it
poured
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
two
fingers
of
beige
head
that
laced
very
well
smelled
solidly
of
dark
chocolate
and
molasses
the
taste
confirmed
the
aroma
with
the
alcohol
content
wellhidden
while
the
mouthfeel
was
superb
creamy
and
velvety
excellent
sipping
beer
with
a
creamy
dessert
but
not
exactly
a
session
beer
drinkability
is
excellent
flavorful
fantastic
mouthfeel
not
wearing
at
all
very
nice
beer
not
at
all
a
chocolate
bomb
like
st
choklat
for
example
but
it
doesnt
try
to
be
what
it
is
is
a
nicely
made
beer
overall
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
but
it
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
just
the
name
sets
itself
up
for
so
much
more
worth
a
look
the
feel
is
medium
drinkability
is
nice
poured
a
dark
viscous
black
into
a
chimay
glass
with
a
little
less
than
a
singlefinger
sandy
brown
head
which
a
sheet
of
lacing
through
the
duration
of
the
drink
aroma
is
roasted
grain
chocolate
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
burnt
toast
some
dark
fruits
emerge
as
it
warms
in
my
glass
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
slick
on
the
tounge
without
being
too
heavy
though
i
was
surprised
by
the
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
caramel
sweetness
in
the
front
with
toast
toffee
a
bit
of
char
then
a
suggestion
of
dark
chocolate
which
does
not
overpower
drinkability
will
get
a
high
score
despite
the
750
ml
serving
size
if
i
ever
found
this
on
tap
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
stay
away
from
it
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
that
doesnt
hit
me
over
the
head
with
chocolate
i
plan
on
trying
it
again
sometime
drink
though
it
does
sit
between
to
styles
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
tasty
and
a
nice
treat
goes
down
easier
than
i
thought
it
would
going
by
the
name
its
not
a
chocolate
bar
in
a
bottle
but
a
drinkable
homage
to
chocolate
in
belgian
tradition
really
enjoyed
this
a
wellbalanced
beer
with
a
nice
dark
chocolate
flavor
that
is
integrated
nicely
overall
a
wellcrafted
beer
id
expect
a
bit
more
chocolate
umph
given
the
name
but
i
think
this
is
right
in
line
with
ommegangs
portfolio
of
wellcrafted
oneoff
brews
i
had
this
ale
on
new
years
day
and
it
was
perfect
for
the
cold
weather
and
special
occasion
as
i
started
this
review
i
was
impressed
that
chocolate
indulgence
is
categorized
as
a
strong
dark
ale
despite
being
labeled
as
a
stout
because
i
thought
it
had
more
of
the
fruitiness
and
bitterness
of
a
dark
ale
it
was
oe
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
because
it
toned
down
the
malty
sweetness
of
typical
belgian
ales
drinkability
overall
very
drinkable
and
worth
trying
it
was
just
as
expected
no
disappointments
pours
black
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
not
as
chocolatey
as
i
expected
but
you
do
get
some
sweetness
the
flavor
is
pretty
hoppy
possibly
some
pacific
northwest
hops
not
as
much
chocolate
as
i
expected
in
the
flavor
either
i
drank
the
second
half
of
the
beer
when
eating
some
ghiradelli
chocolates
and
that
really
made
the
hops
stand
out
thinner
mouthfeel
than
expected
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
name
is
a
little
misleading
since
this
is
not
much
of
a
chocolate
beer
the
creamy
finish
is
complemented
with
a
moderatley
high
carbonation
and
only
a
slightly
sweet
body
very
easy
to
drink
its
an
easy
750
to
put
back
by
yourself
for
a
special
occasion
overall
a
great
chocolate
beer
from
ommegang
the
flavor
was
exceptional
and
at
a
good
price
loved
it
overall
a
nice
chocolate
stout
for
sure
but
not
necessarily
better
than
any
of
the
other
top
chocolate
stouts
ive
had
one
worth
having
once
and
the
pretty
bottle
is
worth
keeping
but
given
the
heavy
price
tag
i
dont
think
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
overall
an
excellent
chocolate
beer
if
youre
expecting
something
really
rich
and
chocolatey
like
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
then
this
doesnt
really
fit
the
bill
but
its
dry
dark
chocolate
character
crossed
with
belgianstyle
stout
really
hits
the
spot
for
me
pours
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
minor
lacing
a
roasted
and
cocoa
malt
aroma
dominates
the
nose
very
little
other
malts
coming
through
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
that
has
a
good
amount
of
roasted
and
bitter
chocolate
taste
that
leaves
it
syrupysticky
at
times
definite
sipper
this
is
a
sweet
beer
that
isnt
overly
sweet
but
balanced
and
warms
the
tongue
up
even
with
a
clean
finish
d
a
decent
brew
tastes
like
you
would
expect
a
typical
chocolate
stout
to
taste
another
respectable
effort
by
ommegang
salud
d
fantastic
delicious
stouty
belgian
dark
a
must
try
for
any
fan
of
stouts
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
great
light
carbonation
makes
this
almost
too
easy
to
drink
its
a
well
balanced
stout
that
doesnt
overdo
anything
drinkability
is
decent
at
best
very
disappointing
all
and
all
left
me
wanting
morenot
as
thickrichor
chocolatey
as
youd
want
from
a
good
stout
this
is
my
kind
of
stout
and
my
kind
of
chocolate
beer
ive
found
that
some
examples
can
come
across
as
artificial
or
heavy
handed
but
thats
not
the
case
here
and
a
wonderful
balance
has
been
struck
good
stuff
had
this
on
daft
a
while
back
and
it
was
a
lot
better
this
time
it
was
poured
with
a
very
nice
light
tan
head
and
plenty
of
lace
color
is
opaque
dark
brown
aroma
was
faintly
bittersweet
and
of
cocoa
flavor
is
less
than
the
aroma
would
have
you
think
shallow
body
is
ok
theres
not
a
whole
lot
here
body
is
ok
and
carbonation
is
decent
strange
because
the
draft
version
i
had
a
while
back
was
so
rich
finish
is
fairly
short
and
forgettable
maybe
it
was
an
off
bottle
or
batch
d
really
delicious
but
nothing
amazing
i
prolly
wont
buy
this
again
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
bad
i
can
find
better
chocolate
beers
than
this
like
youngs
chocolate
stout
is
an
example
of
something
better
not
bad
at
all
though
very
little
carbonation
which
is
good
creamy
dark
chocolates
and
espresso
roasted
malts
pretty
solid
not
too
thick
in
the
mouth
so
easy
not
bad
for
drinkability
leaves
a
little
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
which
is
expected
from
a
stout
but
not
harsh
at
all
d
pretty
drinkable
not
at
all
hot
and
not
too
heavy
a
bit
cloying
at

of

taste
is

a
very

for

im
now
ready
for
christmas
im
not
in
love
with
stouts
like
i
used
to
be
but
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
very
good
not
as
much
chocolate
as
the
name
would
indicate
definitely
stir
up
the
sediment
more
than
the
directions
indicate
for

im
a
stickler
not
very
chocolatey

nice
roasted

some
alcohol
essentially
a
belgian

robust

i
could
make
a
better
chocolate
beer
than
this
this
beer
is
definitely
a
lot
less
sweet
than
you
would
think
with
a
name
like
chocolate
indulgence
but
it
doesnt
matter
because
its
still
really
good
its
very
smooth
and
creamy
but
not
really
something
i
would
seek
out
again

thought
this
was
just
short
of
4
5s
across
the
board
and
it
had
everything
to
do
with
carbonation
so
close
to
a
classicmobyfannapr

since
chocolate
is
not
the
most
predominant
flavor
except
on
the
label
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
for
anything
with
the
word
stout
on
the
label
though
its
really
just
a
deception
all
in
all
the
carbonation
is
just
right
for
this
one
body
is
mediumheavy
and
leaves
a
slick
feeling
on
the

i
really
cant
fault
this
one
for
anything
i
could
be
a
bit
heavier
but
this
is
the
most
chocolate
like
smell
ive
had

and

but
overall
d
moderate
a
good
overall
beer
whos
charm
is
in
its
subtleties
not
very
impressive
for
the
price
however
this
beer
poured
in
to
my
pint
glass
a
dark
opaque
brown
it
was
almost
black
there
were
brown
bubbles
that
filled
the
body
at
first
to
would
form
a
thin
layer
of
head
over
the
beers
body
the
lace
was
actually
pretty
nice
considering
the
lack
of
head
its
aroma
was
fruity
and
candy
like
you
could
smell
the
chocolate
but
it
was
more
of
a
fruit
candy
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
sticky
and
thick
but
honestly
it
goes
down
smooth
it
has
bitter
dark
chocolate
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
burnt
mild
fruity
flavor
it
is
an
alright
after
dinner
beer
overall
a
good
but
not
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
happy
10th
ill
stick
to
and
enjoy
the
regulars
from
them
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
ill
leave
it
up
to
you
on
worth
trying
or
not
d
not
the
best
example
by
far
drinkable
but
lacks
a
certain
chocolate
feel
and
is
very
dry
for
a
stout
to
me
must
be
the
belgian
yeast
but
just
my
taste
i
think
allagash
black
taste
more
like
chocolate
than
this
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
d
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
made
this
beer
pretty
good
a
pretty
solid
stoutlike
brew
by
a
brewery
who
has
traditionally
brewed
solely
belgian
ales
its
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
chocolate
stout
full
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
what
is
to
be
expected
from
ommegang
finally
got
to
try
this
beer
a
good
but
not
great
beer
poured
in
a
snifter
the
beer
was
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
retained
well
some
lacing
aroma
of
cocoa
and
biscuit
nice
chocolate
taste
with
a
bready
background
finishing
bitterness
would
probably
try
it
again
im
glad
i
shared
it
with
my
cousin
and
my
sister
because
i
could
not
have
drunk
it
all
by
myself
very
nice
chocolate
stout
nice
look
in
a
standard
belgian
glass
dark
chocolate
color
sporting
a
lovely
dark
tan
head
with
good
lacing
but
moderate
retention
and
a
bit
of
yeast
cloudiness
from
the
unfiltered
nature
of
this
brew
subtle
malty
nose
on
the
palate
this
is
smooth
and
mildly
chocolaty
but
with
a
sophisticated
chocolate
taste
semithick
mouthfeel
about
right
for
this
style
but
with
pronounced
carbonation
nice
bitter
finish
and
good
drinkability
for
a
strong
ale
pours
nearly
opaque
black
with
tan
head
nose
has
a
plasticlike
chocolate
aroma
reminding
me
of
those
chocolate
bunnies
that
came
in
white
plastic
packaging
at
easter
palate
is
certainly
in
the
milk
chocolate
direction
not
dark
chocolate
but
somehow
lacks
much
of
the
pleasant
sweetness
that
chocolate
usually
has
light
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
presence
on
the
finish
pours
chocolate
colored
with
a
thick
chocolate
marshmallow
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
chocolate
taste
reminded
me
of
an
imperial
stout
like
samuel
smiths
to
be
exact
this
beer
has
a
thickness
comperable
to
maple
syrup
it
also
went
down
very
smoothly
and
i
wouldnt
have
minded
having
a
second
and
at
7
00abv
i
see
no
good
reason
not
to
other
then
the
fact
that
its
normally
13
bucks
a
beers
i
got
it
as
part
of
a
gift
pack
for
my
brother
for
christmas
and
it
came
with
a
3
philosphers
and
a
haipen
looking
forward
to
sampling
the
haipen
too
750
ml
bottle
this
one
poured
a
very
opaque
dark
brown
color
there
was
almost
no
head
on
mine
the
aroma
is
sweet
cocoa
with
possibly
some
hints
of
roastiness
and
smokiness
the
taste
is
definitely
creamy
chocolate
with
some
roastiness
i
was
surprised
that
it
is
only
7
it
tastes
a
bit
richer
than
that
drinks
pretty
easy
only
the
dryness
is
holding
me
back
not
seeing
a
lot
of
belgian
signature
drinks
more
like
an
english
or
american
stout
i
enjoyed
this
this
is
enjoyable
enough
to
be
sure
but
nothing
ill
be
going
out
of
my
way
for
id
rather
ommegang
had
bottled
their
ommegang
rouge
instead
of
this
one
now
that
was
fantastic
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
yeast
bakers
chocolate
is
more
subdued
than
i
would
prefer
lingering
bitterness
not
bad
overall
and
easy
to
drink
d
nice
for
this
holiday
festive
time
of
year
and
the
abv
is
incheck
so
this
makes
for
a
delicious
treat
leave
one
out
for
santa
i
poured
this
one
after
sitting
on
it
about
two
months
very
dark
chocolate
brown
with
tan
cotton
candy
like
foam
if
smells
mildly
of
cocoa
fire
caramel
and
alcohol
as
it
warms
the
gentle
bitterness
and
sweetness
developed
better
with
warming
i
thinks
its
important
on
this
one
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
smoky
mainly
of
roast
coffee
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
whisper
of
molasses
it
pours
an
opaque
sable
like
dark
chocolate
with
a
very
thick
finebubbled
tan
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
flavor
is
just
simply
superb
smoky
and
chocolaty
with
undertones
of
coffee
caramel
and
molasses
it
is
fairly
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
there
is
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
that
balances
the
sweetness
nicely
texture
is
smooth
and
bubbly
and
it
leaves
a
slightly
sweet
mocha
aftertaste
very
festive
and
a
good
dessert

head
lasts

you

the
roasty

blend

the
chocolate
is

not

a
full

and
satisfying
mouthfeel
that
stays
on
the
tongue
while
not
being
cloying
drinkability
is
very
high
for
a
stout
drinking
a
couple
of
22s
of
this
in

row
would
not
be

at

that
is

did
the
beer
not
come
close

delivering
what
the

would
lead
one
to
expect
what
it
gave
in
exchange
is
not
a
pleasing
surprise
nor
an
acceptable
substitution
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
makes
you
think
hides
the
elevated
alcohol
content
too
drinkability
this
is
not
intended
to
be
an
everyday
beer
and
it
wouldnt
particularly
suit
every
day
drinking
but
it
is
chocolaty
and
nice
especially
as
a
desert
beer
would
buy
again
but
i
might
not
mind
waiting
until
next
year
when
they
make
more
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
does
not
go
over
the
top
but
is
right
down
the
middle
pours
dark
brown
with
a
short
tan
head
roasty
cocoa
aroma
with
an
earthy
yeastiness
i
expected
more
chocolateyness
if
that
is
a
word
but
the
taste
was
still
good
the
belgian
chocolates
sweetness
mixed
with
the
yeast
to
produce
a
very
nice
sweetandsour
combo
similar
to
bakers
chocolate
one
of
the
better
belgian
stouts
ive
had
d
to
much
muskyness
makes
this
one
not
an
easy
drinker
the
flavors
arent
that
interesting
all
in
all
this
is
still
a
decent
beer
just
not
one
that
lives
up
to
what
the
label
promises
and
the
price
tag
demanded
d
i
expected
more
chocolate
flavor
because
of
the
name
still
a
good
belgian
ale
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
huge
tan
foamy
head
beautiful
roasted
chocolate
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
coffee
alcohol
and
fruit
roasted
chocolate
maltiness
with
hints
of
coffee
toffee
and
a
well
balanced
alcohol
pesence
very
tasty
d
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
its
got
some
decent
flavors
and
very
good
to
have
with
a
tasting
imo
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
better
example
of
a
chocolate
stout
that
was
very
basic
this
brew
is
basic
but
quick
drinkable
and
accessible
not
bad
at
all
but
absolutely
has
room
for
improvement
i
bought
an
ommegang
gift
pack
down
at
the
headkeeper
the
other
night
while
out
with
some
fellow
coworkers
it
came
with
three
750
ml
bottles
of
ommegang
chocolate
indulgence
three
philosophers
and
hennepin
also
included
was
an
ommegang
glass
the
chocolate
indulgence
pored
into
the
glass
with
a
creamy
head
at
least
two
fingers
thick
there
was
a
nice
lacing
along
the
inside
of
the
glass
that
remained
thought
the
drinking
process
the
aroma
was
laced
with
chocolate
malts
and
leather
the
taste
was
sublime
it
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
hops
malt
and
goodness
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
behold
dability
in
some
ways
drinks
larger
than
a
7
abv
beer
and
is
heavy
enough
that
it
would
be
a
special
occasion
only
beer
for
me
d
overall
an
interesting
but
not
spectacular
beer
worth
a
try
but
not
sometihng
id
actively
seek
out
not
brewed
year
round
so
if
you
see
it
pick
it
up
pours
black
with
about
a
12
of
dark
brown
head
aroma
is
very
subdued
some
malt
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
some
whiffs
of
alcohol
taste
is
mostly
of
some
slightly
bitter
chocolate
there
is
a
nice
malt
undertone
throughout
towards
the
finish
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
some
darker
fruits
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
full
bodied
with
lowmoderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
beer
isnt
the
greatest
chocolate
stout
but
is
enjoyable
although
quite
subdued
i
love
the
tiny
bubbles
the
tiny
belgian
bubbles
enough
of
them
to
actually
give
a
small
head
whoa
its
still
not
long
lived
but
its
there
and
the
tiny
bubbles
it
smells
chocolaty
and
then
you
taste
it
so
bear
with
me
but
my
first
taste
came
like
eating
dry
cocoa
powder
bitter
cocoa
if
you
think
theres
a
difference
eh
as
in
its
pretty
dry
i
was
surprised
at
the
dryness
by
the
end
of
the
first
snifter
a
whopping
4
oz
i
was
very
used
to
the
dryness
and
even
relished
it
when
knowing
what
to
expect
i
couldnt
wait
for
the
next
taste
good
stuff
i
wish
it
didnt
cost
so
much
d
though
brewed
in
the
belgian
style
i
have
to
review
this
as
a
stout
because
it
shares
almost
no
similarities
with
any
bsda
ive
ever
had
its
a
stout
i
dont
care
it
says
it
on
the
bottle
and
it
sure
as
hell
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
one
and
its
a
gooood
one
chocolate
flavor
can
get
pretty
intense
after
on
glass
while
certainly
a
solid
stout
definitely
not
enough
chocolate
flavor
to
justify
the
name
worthy
of
a
try

not

with
a
slow
fading
creamy
head
aroma
is
faint
chocolate
taste
is
chocolate

very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
good
stout
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bigger

taste
overall
good
but
not
worth
the
15
00
i
shelled
out
for
it
good
to
try
at
least
once
aroma
is
roasted
malty
coffee
cocoa
the
flavor
is
strong
with
rasted
malt
cocoa
chocolate
some
espersso
notes
but
very
smooth
and
balanced
a
nicely
bitter
finish
doesnt
overwhlem
a
wonderful
stout
they
call
it
bsda
which
doesnt
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
me
but
for
teh
fruity
notes
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
this
brew
is
more
a
belgianinflected
american
stoutwhatever
it
is
a
great
job
pours

around
an

slowly
dissipates
leaving
some

roasty

the

toasty

definitely
roasty

slightly
burnt
coffee
bakers
chocolate
comes
to
mind
dry
on
the
finish
with
roastiness
dominating
slightly
smokey
complex
and
roasty
for
sure
though
not
quite
as
chocolatey
as
the
name
would
suggest
imo
still
a
very
solid
belgianstyle
stout
and
one
id
definitely
get
again
pours
a
thick
and
oily
black
color
with
a
large
chocolate
brownie
head
mild
nose
of
burnt
malt
bitter
chocolate
and
cream
mostly
the
same
notes
go
towards
the
flavor
i
remember
the
bottles
of
this
being
more
grainy
and
having
powdery
chocolate
notes
none
of
this
is
apparent
on
draught
much
more
creaminess
and
chew
going
on
in
the
mouth
better
medium
body
imo
good
drinkability
still
not
a
stout
thats
going
to
change
your
life
or
anything
but
better
than
the
bottles
dgood
drinkability
with
chocolate
in
the
name
i
expected
an
overpowering
chocolate
i
was
surprised
when
the
chocolate
flavors
instead
melded
well
and
complimented
the
rest
of
the
beers
flavors
d
yes
it
is
pretty
darn
enjoyable
overall
its
an
ok
stout
but
if
you
are
expecting
anything
the
likes
of
black
albert
sloth
etc
you
will
be
very
dissapointed
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
i
will
be
purchasing
again
ok
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
is
far
from
worth
what
my
room
mate
paid
for
it
13
99
i
will
not
be
paying
that
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
am
not
wild
about
it
just
doesnt
quite
strike
a
chord
with
me
interesting
release
and
certainly
worth
a
try
d
very
good
very
drinkable
chocolate
indulgence
is
good
but
i
think
better
can
be
had
for
less
money
than
i
spent
on
this
bottle
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
was
pleasing
in
all
aspects
will
definitely
search
out
again
for
special
occasions
notes
now
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
and
another
winning
beer
from
ommegang
d
i
cracked
this
open
after
work
on
friday
afternoon
and
that
reason
alone
would
make
it
an
a
in
a
perfect
world
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
im
sorry
to
say
that
this
beer
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
everything
seemed
fine
until
i
tasted
pennies
in
the
finish
i
know
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
cocoa
used
in
the
brewing
but
im
not
sure
exactly
how
this
happened
a
friend
also
had
the
same
experience
maybe
ill
give
this
beer
a
try
again
if
i
can
find
it
on
tap
if
you
liked
this
try
the
brooklyn
chocolate
stout
drinkability
overall
flavor
is
pretty
mild
nothing
special
goes
down
smooth
and
low
abv
makes
it
even
easier
to
drink
a
soft
fullbodied
stout
with
a
belgian
twist
chocolate
indulgence
is
ripe
with
delicate
subtleties
in
a
complex
weaving
d
this
is
a
nice
desert
brew
that
would
go
well
with
bitter
chocolate
it
requires
sipping
so
it
would
be
a
poor
choice
for
a
session
brew
it
is
a
decent
substitute
for
a
hot
chocolate
on
a
damp
cool
fall
night
opaque
color
with
large
offbrown
head
that
clings
to
the
sides
not
too
pleasant
aroma
of
strong
alcohol
and
dark
chocolate
tastes
of
pure
dark
chocolate
alcohol
malt
and
chewiness
heavy
bodied
beer
with
mild
carbonation
creates
a
thick
potion
feel
a
dark
dessert
of
a
beer
that
would
make
godiva
dirty
their
pants
elegant
and
beautiful
but
not
a
defining
beer
of
the
stout
genre
definitely
worth
of
enjoying
with
some
ice
cream
though
i
paired
this
brew
up
with
lindt
lindor
extra
dark
chocolate
from
switzerland
the
chocolate
was
a
little
too
sweet
to
completely
compliment
this
beer
maybe
a
less
sweet
and
more
bitter
belgian
chocolate
would
go
better
with
it
got
a
chance
as
per
usual
because
im
famously
lucky
to
sample
this
rather
expensive
bottle
at
a
beer
tasting
for
free
score
the
beer
poured
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
creamy
tan
head
the
head
retained
well
and
it
left
lots
of
sticky
lacing
it
looked
like
cocacola
the
aroma
was
dry
cocoa
powder
and
toasted
coffee
beans
the
flavors
were
very
big
liquid
smoke
bittersweet
chocolate
some
hints
of
milk
chocolate
rich
roasted
malt
and
a
very
long
espresso
finish
it
did
strike
me
as
more
bitter
than
i
was
expecting
and
for
a
beer
named
chocolate
indulgence
i
felt
the
chocolate
flavors
were
understated
and
lacking
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
the
carbonation
just
right
but
it
was
a
little
light
dare
i
say
it
watery
ouch
for
the
price
i
really
just
couldnt
convince
myself
to
buy
one
i
love
this
brewery
but
i
was
both
surprised
and
a
little
disappointed
by
this
one
black
pour
with
thick
tan
head
great
globby
lacing
aroma
is
of
light
chocolaty
malt
over
fruity
esters
a
little
medicinal
smells
like
how
a
chocolate
triple
would
smell
taste
is
light
bittersweet
chocolate
light
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
it
would
benefit
greatly
from
more
malt
and
much
more
chocolate
character
to
back
its
name
a
fine
brew
from
ommegang
just
not
as
fine
as
the
others
nice
ill
give
it
a
try
again
sometime
just
arrived
in
the
dallas
area
i
poured
it
into
a
val
dieu
widemouthed
chalice
the
color
is
opaquequite
darkwith
a
large
darktan
head
on
top
that
fades
but
never
dies
away
the
nose
is
somewhat
restrainedtheres
a
roasted
dark
cocoa
edge
but
its
not
all
that
strong
the
flavor
is
exactly
as
expected
dark
chocolate
bitter
and
roasted
but
fortunately
not
overwhelmingly
chocolate
nor
at
all
sweet
maybe
a
little
onedimensional
but
a
wellcrafted
beer
this
might
be
my
favorite
of
the
ommegang
brews
a
very
well
put
together
belgian
strong
dark
ale
relatively
thin
liquor
for
what
i
was
expecting
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
dark
chocolate
with
some
cream
this
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
belgian
flavors
and
a
dark
english
porter
i
would
probably
have
given
the
beer
even
higher
marks
particularly
in
smell
if
the
beer
had
a
higher
abv
now
i
write
that
with
some
trepidation
because
the
alcoholic
flavor
of
the
1
5
higher
abbey
ale
was
a
primary
motivation
for
me
in
panning
it
so
as
long
as
ommegang
raised
the
abv
without
making
it
taste
like
they
dropped
a
few
shots
of
vodka
in
the
bottle
the
beer
would
benefit
from
the
change
again
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
ommegang
i
wish
i
had
let
it
sit
for
awhile
longer
stellar
looking
poured
pretty
much
black
light
chocolate
brown
head
not
as
thick
as
i
was
expecting
nutty
chocolate
aromas
the
two
words
coming
to
my
head
are
dirty
chocolate
for
the
smell
not
bad
almost
chocolate
cordial
cherry
included
flavor
a
bit
of
that
typical
belgian
tartness
sourness
interesting
but
i
was
looking
more
indulgent
by
the
name
and
look
of
the
bottle
i
was
imagining
and
hoping
for
a
smooth
luscious
chocolate
flavor
more
reminiscent
of
youngs
double
chocolate
yet
it
is
a
nice
flavor
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
i
know
this
is
a
belgian
stout
but
i
was
still
looking
for
stouter
body
all
in
all
quite
good
and
quite
drinkable
this
is
not
available
i
think
in
texas
right
now
the
other
ommegangs
are
and
they
are
far
superior
i
think
so
in
the
end
i
am
happy
i
had
this
on
tap
at
taco
mac
in
atlanta
the
beer
looked
really
appetizing
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
chunky
milk
chocolate
colored
that
lasted
forever
the
smell
was
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
about
what
i
expected
given
the
name
the
taste
is
ok
solid
i
guess
but
less
chocolaty
than
the
name
indulgence
would
lead
you
to
believe
it
had
a
good
malt
character
more
roasted
than
burnt
which
i
appreciate
the
body
was
lighter
than
i
expected
but
made
for
easier
drinking
picked
up
a
750ml
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
medium
brown
head
smell
is
mostly
of
dark
chocolate
no
surprise
there
taste
is
of
nice
dark
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
sweetness
finish
leaves
you
thinking
you
just
drank
some
hot
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
drinkability
is
high
this
is
enjoyable
year
round
but
im
thinking
of
picking
up
a
few
bottles
for
the
winter
holidays
black
and
opaque
with
a
good
stout
head
smell
is
strongly
of
milky
chocolate
theres
a
surprising
bit
of
hop
up
front
before
developing
into
rich
and
smooth
chocolate
good
flavor
but
not
very
complex
the
beer
is
failed
by
its
thin
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
though
for
belgian
stouts
ive
only
the
allagash
black
to
compare
it
to
but
its
not
in
the
same
league
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
seriously
reminds
me
of
a
stout
would
recommend
to
anyone
md
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
very
creamy
texture
if
you
like
chocolate
and
stouts
this
is
a
great
beer
for
you
to
try
d
quite
drinkable
for
its
strength
though
belgian
dark
chocolate
was
used
in
the
brewing
i
have
no
idea
how
or
why
this
drink
is
classified
as
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
its
nothing
similar
to
any
i
ever
had
the
descriptor
is
dead
wrong
as
this
brew
is
a
stout
make
no
mistake
and
a
very
tasty
one
at
that
this
beer
tastes
ok
but
considering
the
brewery
and
the
style
is
a
major
disappointment
probably
the
darkest
beer
ive
had
ever
the
smell
is
a
bit
overpowering
of
beer
i
really
dont
smell
anything
but
unfortunately
i
overpoured
so
the
head
is
rediculous
but
still
not
bad
tasting
like
some
heads
get
i
was
startled
by
the
lack
of
carbonation
startled
but
not
unimpressed
the
foam
tasted
like
a
simple
ommegang
but
the
beer
iteself
tasted
like
well
like
nothing
but
the
aftertaste
was
a
spectacular
chocolate
flavor
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
i
rate
this
one
above
youngs
but
below
the
rouge
i
had
on
tap
although
i
have
yet
to
taste
anything
close
to
the
rogue
i
had
on
tap
even
a
bottle
of
rogue
ive
been
dissapointed
by
all
the
chocolate
beers
since
my
first
taste
of
one
but
never
all
out
dissatisfied
maybe
my
memory
of
the
first
time
is
like
my
memory
of
my
first
woman
distorted
but
not
all
untrue
overall
a
little
better
then
youngs
choc
stout
and
similar
to
it
highly
recommend
d
not
too
bad
would
definately
drink
one
again
but
its
not
something
im
gona
go
searching
for
d
alcohol
is
not
as
hefty
as
some
of
the
style
can
be
overall
satisfaction
is
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
road
however
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
and
well
worth
trying
but
not
one
that
came
across
as
particularly
complex
to
my
palate
d
its
not
particularly
hard
to
get
down
especially
since
its
so
thin
but
i
almost
didnt
want
to
finish
it
ultimately
this
beer
was
a
huge
disappointment
from
a
once
favorite
brewery
how
sad
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
all
the
great
flavors
you
would
expect
in
a
stout
but
with
a
bit
more
depth
to
it
making
it
stand
out
definitely
worth
a
try
and
very
tasty
an
enjoyable
after
dinner
indulgence
i
do
enjoy
such
crossover
styles
as
this
easy
drinking
yet
quite
powerful
well
done
and
not
in
the
red
meat
sense
this
is
good
stuff
drinkability
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
a
surprisingly
refreshing
dessertstyled
beer
and
not
really
what
i
expected
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
recommended
d
750ml
was
plenty
its
good
but
id
want
something
else
for
the
next
one
very
interesting
d
this
is
pretty
tasty
beer
though
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
its
simply
a
little
too
rich
for
me
overall
a
good
beer
to
try
this
beer
is
an
effing
mess
and
a
near
drainpour
for
me
just
a
disaster
on
many
levels
d
based
on
the
name
not
impressed
glad
i
only
bought
1
bottle
however
take
the
lable
off
and
not
knowing
what
i
was
drinking
it
is
a
decent
stout
a
huge
three
finger
tall
light
brown
head
has
a
nice
mix
of
bubbles
that
slowly
fade
leaving
thick
lace
body
is
opaque
thick
syrupy
blackness
nose
is
full
of
coco
yahoo
chocolate
drink
and
even
a
hint
of
spicey
hops
in
the
backround
as
you
take
first
sip
you
get
sime
smokey
chocolate
up
front
a
quick
dose
of
bakers
dark
chocolate
bitter
is
noticeable
up
next
some
distinct
grassy
hops
show
up
at
the
end
of
the
palate
vanilla
tones
are
there
also
the
dark
chocolate
feel
really
holds
on
to
the
mouthfeel
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
not
over
done
chocolate
stout
drinks
best
on
the
warmer
side
a
few
people
i
know
had
set
me
up
for
disappointment
with
this
but
instead
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
makes
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
and
would
be
great
for
sharing
with
friends
dan
interesting
take
on
a
chocolate
stout
this
one
is
hard
to
classify
if
pressed
and
having
no
idea
i
would
classify
this
as
a
milksweet
stout
i
will
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
maybe
to
pour
over
some
vanilla
ice
cream
another
interesting
and
unique
beer
from
the
ommegang
crew
way
too
drinkable
for
its
strength
in
terms
of
masking
the
alcohol
the
sweetness
and
richness
would
make
it
hard
for
me
to
imagine
polishing
off
a
whole
bomber
myself
but
ill
be
happy
to
try
drinkability
is
nice
very
tasty
and
worthy
of
savoring
every
sip
alcohol
is
evident
but
positively
with
a
nice
rumminess
almost
burbon
barrel
like
really
beautiful
im
shocked
and
wish
i
had
bought
more
i
still
give
this
one
some
nice
aging
potential
flavor
wise
the
flavors
would
ripen
but
the
body
would
fall
out
poured
into
a
tulip
a
very
nice

brown
color
very
nice
carbonation
awesome

all
the
ommegang

thanks

and
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
d
a
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
strong
dark
ale
with
stout
character
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
given
ommegangs
track
record
i
was
expecting
to
be
blown
away
i
got
a
nice
chocolate
stout
instead
and
that
feels
like
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
the
taste
is
slightly
metallic
smooth
cramy
some
nice
fruity
undertones
chocolate
fresh
baked
cookies
frothy
very
sweet
there
is
a
suttle
hop
presence
but
that
metallic
taste
seems
to
dominate
this
is
a
good
beverage
not
the
best
by
ommegang
but
a
decent
brew
pours
a
two
finger
thick
brown
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
good
lace
black
as
midnight
good
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
chocolate
nose
flavor
is
a
rich
unsweetened
chocolate
with
a
bakers
chocolate
finish
nice
beefy
stout

for
a
750ml
bottle
from
yankee
spirits
south
attleboro
ma
not
bad
drinkability
is
high
since
it
is
just
chocolatie
goodness
not
heavy
and
could
be
a
good
session
beer
a
good
beer
all
together
another
very
well
done
chocolate
stout
as
so
many
of
them
are
impressive
appearance
that
actually
looked
smooth
nearblack
in
color
with
a
big
rocky
tancolored
head
my
friend
commented
that
it
looked
vicious
smell
was
somewhat
straightforward
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
taste
was
nice
sweet
malty
chocolatey
a
touch
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
not
too
strong
or
bitter
but
rather
balanced
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
somewhat
light
for
the
style
which
made
it
more
drinkable
and
refreshing
overall
a
good
drink
richness
is
high
so
there
may
be
limits
on
it
but
it
went
well
with
my
strawberry
birthday
pie
almost
a
complete
blackout
in
my
glass
initial
flavors
of
coffee
and
sweetness
from
the
dark
malts
but
nothing
too
unbalanced
quit
nice
the
finish
is
what
really
grabbed
me
with
its
dryness
obviously
coming
from
its
use
of
cocoa
powder
delivering
dark
chocolate
flavors
that
were
very
pleasing
to
the
taste
buds
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
i
will
certainly
try
again
as
black
as
black
can
be
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
good
lace
is
left
behind
this
smells
mostly
of
cocoa
powder
rich
dark
belgian
chocolate
flavor
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
malt
punch
is
strong
at
first
with
chocolate
flavor
coming
in
strong
in
the
aftertaste
the
feel
is
very
smooth
not
quite
as
chocolately
as
i
would
have
expected
and
probably
the
least
impressive
ommegang
release
to
date
but
its
still
solid
very
rich
and
full
bodied
incredibly
drinkable
bottle
courtesy
of
kryptic
poured
a
pitchblack
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
totally
dominated
by
loads
of
chocolate
malt
notes
with
some
subtle
sweetness
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
huge
chocolate
notes
with
some
light
sweet
notes
body
is
slightly
thin
for
the
style
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
thought
and
some
good
carbonation
alcohol
was
not
apparent
overall
a
very
interesting
experiment
by
this
fine
brewery
but
lacking
some
character
and
maybe
some
lactose
to
be
truly
inspiring
notes
i
have
had
this
at
brewery
ommegang
during
the
2007
waffles
and
puppets
event
and
i
dont
remember
it
having
any
metallic
flavor
to
it
overall
i
still
enjoied
it
and
look
forward
to
having
more
of
it
at
this
years
waffles
and
puppets
a
passable
brewpub
porter
maybe
but
a
massive
disappointment
as
ommegangs
corked
and
caged
anniversary
indulgence
d
good
but
not
what
was
advertised
i
would
not
get
this
again
for
what
i
paid
for
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitterness
much
like
very
dark
bitter
chocolate
while
i
appreciate
subtlety
its
almost
too
subtle
especially
for
a
beer
called
chocolate
indulgence
its
good
but
typical
of
so
many
other
u
s
brewed
stouts
ones
made
by
2nd
and
3rd
rate
breweries
even
the
lack
of
any
discernible
belgian
characteristics
was
unexpected
same
blackasnight
appearance
old
rasputins
head
is
even
thicker
looks
like
it
would
support
a
silver
dollar
rasputin
definitely
packs
more
of
a
punch
more
viscous
almost
oily
mouthfeel
dense
smoke
and
caramelized
malts
big
alcohol
backbone
despite
all
that
really
drinkable
though
i
think
it
comes
down
to
mood
on
a
freezing
cold
winters
night
in
front
of
a
nice
cracklin
hardwood
fire
i
reach
for
the
old
rasputin
the
chocolate
indulgence
i
would
enjoy
any
time
of
year
in
any
weather
edit
the
previous
review
is
of
the
2007
version
i
had
the
2008
edition
a
couple
months
ago
and
it
was
much
improved
i
read
somewhere
that
the
recipe
was
tweaked
for
the
08
and
the
metallic
taste
was
completely
gone
i
didnt
take
notes
for
a
review
but
it
would
score
much
higher
i
paired
mine
with
a
bavarian
beer
cheese
and
a
goat
milk
brie
the
bavarian
beer
cheese
went
perfectly
with
it
but
the
brie
was
soso
i
stupidly
expected
something
sweeter
when
i
saw
the
words
chocolate
indulgence
thick
pour
with
a
hot
chocolate
color
head
that
lasts
forever
two
opposite
smells
of
chocolate
one
being
sweet
chocolate
the
later
being
dark
french
roast
coffee
beans
come
out
a
little
on
the
nose
as
well
the
palate
starts
off
with
chocolate
that
is
actually
quite
creamy
almost
sweet
only
until
you
take
a
breath
of
air
does
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
really
take
effect
i
really
wanted
to
see
more
of
a
richcreamy
palate
with
a
chocolate
style
beer
good
balance
nothing
over
the
top
although
i
would
appreciate
a
little
more
complexity
to
be
great
mouthfeel
is
nicemedium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
of
this
if
it
werent
for
that
metallic
flavor
but
as
it
was
i
didnt
have
a
problem
sacrificing
a
small
portion
for
a
steak
maridande
definitely
improved
the
marinade
ill
say
that
ovreall
a
disappointment
i
was
excited
about
this
one
as
i
have
enjoyed
every
one
of
ommegangs
beers
this
was
above
average
for
sureits
hard
to
hate
chocolatebut
i
just
found
it
too
sharp
and
unrefined
kudos
to
brewery
ommegang
for
a
decades
worth
of
excellent
craft
beer
unfortunately
where
chocolate
indulgence
stout
is
concerned
the
contents
of
the
bottle
are
not
equal
to
the
name
and
the
packaging
it
wasnt
a
waste
of
9
99
but
i
have
no
desire
to
buy
another
an
excellent
stout
one
to
stock
up
on
and
enjoy
now
and
down
the
road
with
good
friends
best
at
the
warmer
side
of
cellar
temperatures
d
a
worthy
anniversary
offering
and
another
step
in
the
right
direction
for
belgian
stouts
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
creamy
texture
very
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
i
would
argue
with
the
belgian
strong
dark
ale
label
the
label
on
the
bottle
says
its
a
stout
it
borders
on
being
an
ris
but
could
easily
qualify
as
a
sweet
stout
drinkability
sorry
but
no
i
just
didnt
care
for
this
beer
that
was
about
as
much
fun
as
peeling
potatoes
notes
i
may
have
appreciated

it

at

its

there

the

could

would

with

is

such
as
the
one
i

reviewing

beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
wants
to
enjoy
something
a

strange
brew
not
the
usual
sweet
spices
but
pleasant
nonetheless
worth
a
try
if
you
can
score
just
one
tasty
enough
sweet
and
spicy
jd
t
its
fairly
tasty
and
easy
drinking
although
in
terms
of
flavour
there
are
a
couple
of
issues
it
has
nothing
in
the
way
of
typical
xmas
or
winter
brew
flavours
and
it
taste
like
a
brown
ale
and
not
much
like
a
belgian
dark
although
that
is
likely
just
miscategorized
here
i
did
enjoy
it
but
it
was
nothing
like
what
i
expected
easy
enough
to
drink
but
its
missing
a
little
something
but
i
dont
even
know
what
im
wishing
for
interesting
brew
worth
trying
more
of
a
brown
ale
with
slight
belgian
affectations
than
anything
and
at
the
same
time
eminently
drinkable
the
bittersweet
nutty
character
urging
you
to
put
down
the
silly
laptop
and
just
have
some
more
overall
not
the
best
holiday
beer
but
not
the
worst
either
most
likely
wont
try
this
again
the
most
overcarbonated
beer
ive
ever
experienced
in
my
life
as
soon
as
the
cap
came
off
this
gushered
like
a
fire
hydrant
at
full
pressure
within
10
seconds
there
was
only
two
inches
of
beer
in
the
750
ml
bottle
making
this
the
most
expensive
tiny
half
glass
of
beer
ive
ever
purchased
this
is
the
second
massive
gusher
in
three
days
and
im
not
a
happy
camper
i
envy
the
other
reviewer
who
had
no
carbonation
poured
the
remainder
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
the
massive
head
dissipated
very
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
offwhite
in
color
the
remaining
beer
is
a
murky
dark
mahogany
brown
aroma
of
dark
and
sour
fruit
a
hint
of
caramel
and
earthy
spicing
taste
is
subdued
light
flavor
of
dark
and
light
fruit
cherries
plum
and
apple
sour
cherry
finishes
sour
with
light
spicing
much
closer
to
a
saison
or
biere
de
garde
than
a
belgian
dark
ale
the
spicing
somewhat
overwhelms
the
other
flavors
and
id
like
a
bit
more
malt
for
a
belgian
dark
light
bodied
but
nicely
carbonated
once
it
settled
down
this
was
a
miss

medium
body
is
lightly
carbonated

watery
but
finishes
with
a
spiced
wooden
dryness
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
one
that
i
will
likely
not
revisit
the
spicing
is
just
too
heavy
and
it
lacks
that
little
bit
of
extra
power
to
really
warm
you
up
when
the
weather
turns
cold
this
isnt
a
bad
effort
but
its
not
great
either
maybe
the
harshest
spiced
beer
ive
ever
had
clouded
amber

even
lacing
aroma
has
a
nice
pleasant
fruitiness
with
christmas
spices

makes
this
beer
nice
in
the
nose
flavor
is
full
of
carbonation
and
a
rush
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
all
spice
cardamon
almost
burns
the
palate
with
spice
doesnt
really
let
the
base
beer
shine
at
all
mouthfeel
is
super
carbonated
medium
bodied
but
the
long
lasting
spice
factor
coats
the
palate
to
the
point
of
sickening
spice
overall
the
nose
was
nice
i
liked
the
tropical
tart
fruit
nose
but
the
barrage
of
harsh
spice
really
ruins
this
beer
the
cpj
poured
from
a
green
25
4
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
cloudy
caramel
color
but
the
score
will
be
bumped
down
a
notch
because
there
is
no
head
whatsoever
smell
is
of
spices
some
fruits
taste
starts
of
with
green
apples
some
spices
grapes
a
bit
wine
like
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
different
and
solid
beer
d
drinkable
but
unremarkable
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
but
nothing
really
stands
out
in
particular
to
make
this
an
interesting

beer

still

thing

not
something
i
would
recommend
either

wells
me
note
i
noticed
lesser
reviews
for
this
beer
i
have
been
aging
this
particular
bottle
for
over
a
year
perhaps
this
age
has
improved
the
beer
d
a
drinkable
brew
for
me
but
not
much
else
a
lot
better
winter
brews
out
there
some
solid
spice
flavours
but
the
overall
character
of
the
beer
is
thin
and
lacking
ive
had
better
for
sure
this
is
a
drinkable
slightly
above
average
beer
in
my
opinion
this
one
is
sort
of
like
a
bad
waterly
soda
no
need
to
try
again
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
massive
yeast
cloud
that
slowly
settles
and
becomes
one
with
the
brew
fruity
yeast
esters
plum
green
apple
melon
chocolate
rich
berry
notes
cinnamon
and
a
mild
tone
of
oxidation
creamy
in
body
at
first
as
the
bubbles
invade
the
tongue
the
beer
falls
off
the
palate
very
quickly
a
fruity
malty
aftertaste
is
left
lingering
very
drinkable
an
odd
but
welcome
winter
offering
drinkability
well
unfortunately
this
one
wasnt
very
good
and
one
i
cannot
recommend
for
me
its
less
of
a
bière
de
noël
and
more
of
a
bière
de
no
thanks
everything
from
the
spice
character
to
the
malt
profile
its
all
so
mild
and
uninteresting
like
a
saison
this
beer
has
a
mild
spiciness
and
a
light
mouthfeel
it
is
also
substantialy
creamy
and
grew
on
me
throughout
the
meal
pours
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
white
foam
and
lace
sweet
and
spicy
not
bad
for
france
refreshing
carbonation
suprisingly
above
average
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
fluffy
head
decent
retention
and
a
nice
laceing
aroma
is
of
dark
ripe
fruits
and
yeast
body
is
medium
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
like
a
light
belgin
ale
fruity
with
hints
of
spice
a
bit
late
in
the
season
for
a
winter
beerbut
worth
the
try
an
average
winter
warmer
at
best
taste
is
musty
and
very
fruity
with
some
dirty
socks
this
is
a
sort
of
belgian
pale
ale
the
malt
is
a
bit
dark
and
it
has
some
candi
sugar
notes
but
nothing
too
crazy
bitterness
is
low
carbonation
is
out
of
control
every
sip
is
a
mouth
full
of
gas
this
makes
the
drinkability
poor
fresh
from
france
this
ale
pours
with
a
red
burgundy
color
and
has
a
long
lasting
collar
of
white
foam
aroma
is
depthless
but
shows
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
and
green
bottle
skunk

fresh

but
still
shows
a
lot
of
green

character

flavored

character
no
yeast
or

character
undrinkable
drinkability
not
really
feeling
winter
as
i
sit
here
on
a
golf
course
in
arizona
decent
flavors
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
best
winter
beer
i
have
had
maybe
even
less
than
average
still
not
bad
though
just
a
touch
boring
75cl
bottle
of
the
2008
release
pours
a
beautiful
honey
orange
with
a
billowing
eggshell
cap
and
lots
of
sediment
very
effervescent
the
foam
cap
is
resilient
eventually
dying
down
to
a
thick
film
while
leaving
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aromas
of
sour
apples
vinegar
lemon
zest
barnyard
yeast
and
a
faint
malt
background
blend
to
give
it
a
very
nice
scent
the
sour
character
is
dampened
on
the
palate
with
a
pleasantly
sweet
slightly
fruity
character
balancing
the
a
bit
of
tartness
again
citrus
comes
to
mind
along
with
some
earthiness
and
spice
hops
are
evident
in
the
finish
i
love
beers
like
thisvery
complex
lots
of
character
and
yet
a
lowish
abv
d
definitely
good
beer
i
will
pick
this
up
again
come
next
christmas
the
sourness
is
appetizing
and
is
a
nice
change
from
all
of
the
supermalty
winter
beers
pours
a
dirty
looking
ambercopper
with
a
almond
head
that
billows
a
good
three
and
a
half
fingers
tallvery
carbonatedhintpour
slowly
not
an
over
abundance
of
lacing
just
enough
to
add
some
nice
flare
the
nose
smells
like
cider
vinegar
and
soured
pears
it
burns
my
nose
just
a
little
which
is
surprising
considering
the
low
abv
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
a
good
malt
backbone
is
accented
with
spice
and
tart
fruit
flavors
wow
this
is
super
tart
reminds
me
of
a
thin
flanders
red
with
lots
more
fruit
tartness
and
spiciness
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
which
gives
a
medium
feel
and
excellent
drinkability
d
the
soft
wild
notes
work
well
with
the
fresh
malt
flavors
and
the
orange
rind
brightness
bridges
the
malt
and
hops
working
in
concert
with
the
spices
this
beer
is
not
big
and
no
overly
complex
but
is
very
balanced
and
delcious
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
thiriez
beers
seems
like
a
polarizing
beerall
of
thiriezs
brews
seem
to
challenge
expectationbut
one
i
at
least
give
a
thumbs
up
reminded
me
of
firstrate
champagne
and
would
be
an
excellent
substitute
to
pop
open
or
in
this
case
uncap
come
midnight
on
new
years
it
is
delicious
wellbalanced
spicy
but
not
overly
so
with
a
nice
maltiness
and
a
touch
of
balancing
flavoursome
bitterness
a
unique
nicely
brew
this
is
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
holiday
beer
not
bad
at
all
really
nothing
great
going
on
here
its
fine
definitely
not
a
drain
pour
but
just
pretty
unremarkable
thireiz
biere
de
noel
might
be
an
appropriate
winter
beer
for
the
the
cote
dazur
but
those
living
in
more
northerly
regions
of
france
will
want
something
more
substantial
while
this
is
enjoyable
beer
especially
in
late
summer
i
hope
the
brewery
gives
us
something
completely
different
the
next
time
around
nicely
drinkable
much
different
from
any
other
winter
warmer
i
have
ever
had
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
750
ml
bottle
different
label
than
the
one
pictured
despite
the
name
not
really
what
i
think
of
as
a
xmas
ale
being
lighter
in
both
body
alcohol
and
presence
than
your
typical
winter
ale
nonetheless
enjoyable
with
fruity
notes
typical
of
a
belgian
bruin
even
though
it
isnt
d
decent
christmas
beer
enjoyable
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
during
a
session
drinkability
is
ok
i
suppose
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
heartier
offering
for
a
bière
de
noël
and
the
lack
of
body
leaves
the
spices
overdone
bbe
06
good
head
and
a
amber
brown
beer
with
quiet
some
haze
nose
is
sweet
gale
and
malts
with
camallic
note
overall
decent
and
good
but
missing
litle
spark
to
make
it
great
taste
is
good
also
having
a
fine
sweet
but
fresh
maltyness
still
dry
overall
caracter
and
smooth
drinking
aftertaste
is
litle
peppery
and
low
bitterness
but
enjoyable
as
this
whole
brew
is
drinks
easy
and
though
there
is
nothing
heavy
about
it
enjoyable
to
me
and
imo
subtile
taste
d
i
cannot
believe
that
i
have
had
a
beer
this
good
in
my
fridge
for
so
long
smooth
complex
yet
understated
perfect
sipping
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
just
slightly
above
average
for
a
belgian
dark
ale
it
was
pretty
smooth
but
in
the
end
i
thought
it
was
just
a
little
bland
and
i
wish
the
taste
was
as
bright
as
the
aroma
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
clean
a
little
crisp
not
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
glass
is
a
good
amount
for
me
i
could
drink
the
whole
bottle
but
i
think
after
one
glass
i
would
start
to
get
bored
with
it
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
good
and
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
they
werent
bad
but
they
could
both
use
just
a
little
work
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
glass
and
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
great
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
a
little
indifferent
about
this
beer
i
didnt
hate
itbut
i
didnt
love
it
either
and
i
wish
it
was
just
a
little
more
complex
and
interesting
this
beer
made
an
ok
first
impression
for
this
brewery
and
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
more
of
their
beers
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
but
i
think
it
needs
a
little
work
better
luck
next
time

the

tasting
o
generally
a
pleasant
enough
belgian
dark
however
the
label
and
timing
left
me
hoping
it
would
have
more
of
an
winterxmas
quality
to
it
which
it
fails
to
deliver
on
but
still
well
worth
a
try
d
this
was
a
nice
bsda
but
nothing
special
it
would
probably
age
really
well
but
it
was
also
ok
fresh

drinkability

good

belgian
style
strong

jd
overall
good
but
just
good
nothing
outstanding
or
really
new
its
well
done
though
and
id
have
it
again
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
while
it
has
a
belgian
dark
strong
ale
profile
it
also
has
some
dry

qualities
packs
a
lot
of
dark
wintery
and
spicy
flavor
into
a
beer
that
is
just
7

and
is
not
too
sweet
gladly
will
i
drink
more
of
this
pours

color
with
hints
of
light
visible
around
the
edges
there
is
a
two
finger
slightly
beige
head
which
leaves

the
aroma
is
of
bubblegum
banana
and
some
dark
fruits
the
taste
follows
suit
the
beginning
has
a
dark
fruit
flavor
profile
this
gives
way
to
bananas
along
with
nutmeg
and
cinnomon
the
backend
brings
a
big
bubblegum
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
moderatley
carbonated
and
a
little
creamy
overall
it
was
a
slightly
above
average
beer
everything
was
good
but
not
great
overall
turned
out
to
be
pretty
damn
enjoyable
curious
to
try
it
fresh
at
some
point
a
decent
winter
indulgence
the
savoury
spices
on
the
downlow
alongside
a
nicely
multitoned
maltiness
and
some
equally
tame
alcohol
warming
all
in
all
the
preceding
was
a
mawkish
way
of
describing
a
simply
wellintegrated
tasty
accompaniment
to
the
various
sugary
offerings
so
prevalent
at
this
time
of
year
id
drink
this
again
and
its
reasonably
at

it
nothing

so
it
seemed
a
hearty
aroma
as
i
pick
up

sweetness
touches
of
spice
and
yeast
and
i
swear
im
getting
a
hint
of
citric
notes
like
orange
peel
fuller
body
than
expected
a
good
chewiness
along
w
the
smoothness
and
i
get

dry
and
sweet
malts
with
minor
hopiness
and
traces
of

not
the

the

gives
it
a
more
unique
flavor
back
to
the
beer
once
i
had
some
in

i
was
struck
by
its
appropriateness
for
the
time
it
was
a
bit
thin
approaching
medium
mouthfeel
but
it
was
like
biting
into

zounds

body
would
have
been
even
better
poured
a
dark
brown
with
brownish
highlights
that
had
a
thin
frothy
head
and
left
a
little
acing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
nose
was
moslty
grainy
and
sweet
from
the
malts
with
faint
honey
dark
fruit
notes
the
taste
was
also
sweet
from
the
malts
but
with
honey
dark
fruit
accents
and
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
notes
the
brew
was
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
malty
and
silky
finish
the
brew
was
moslty
just
sweet
but
drank
good
not
a
beer
i
could
have
lots
of
d
after
my
previous
experiences
with
this
brewery
i
wasnt
in
a
huge
rush
to
try
this
one
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
however
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
good
drinking
experience
d
i
finished
my
glass
in
no
time
easy
drinking
and
at
7
3
i
considered
another
but
i
was
already
under
the
spell
of
the
yeast
it
stayed
with
me
this
is
a
good
belgian
dark
that
is
on
the
spicy
side
but
a
bit
unbalanced
good
for
a
gander
a
damn
drinkable
belgian
dark
beer
even
at
over
7
percent
abv
not
too
rich
but
satisfying
this
is
kind
of
like
half
a
dubbel
remarkably
flavorful
and
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
kick
your
ass
the
way
most
belgians
do
id
love
to
find
it
on
draft
nice
stuff
i
like
this
rather
lively
prickly
carbonation
not
entirely
what
id
associate
with
the
style
but
it
does
lend
this
winter
beer
a
nice
refreshing
quality
not
as
rich
or
complex
as
i
would
think
it
wouldcouldshould
be
still
its
a
nice
sipper
winterish
i
suppose
not
particularly
special
but
certainly
not
bad
and
certainly
worth
trying
very
good
christmas
beer
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
persisted
well
not
much
aroma
a
bit
of
spice
more
came
through
in
the
taste
like
cocoa
with
some
cinnamon
sprinkled
on
it
the
spice
lingered
on
and
almost
became
unpleasant
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
it
out
the
beer
was
smooth
and
moderately
full
bodied
but
it
didnt
make
up
for
the
lack
of
flavor
given
to
me
by
a
friend
probably
never
search
it
out
on
my
own
but
tasty
enough
if
you
are
after
something
belgian
very
nice
like
all
rulles
beers
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
red
chestnut
brown
wth
large
foamy
white
head
aroma
of
clove
alcohol
cinnamon
and
spiciness
taste
very
similar
to
aroma
dominated
by
cloves
pepper
and
other
spices
also
hints
of
fruit
and
alcohol
cuvee
meilleurs
voeux
is
loosely
translated

new
years
eve
deserves
a
beer
that
delivers
a
lot
more
excitement
than
this
bottom
line
looks
like
a
dream
tastes
like
a
good
day
at
the
office
and
drinks
like
an
evening
at
home
or
something
like
that
drinkability
overall
a
bit
too
deep
and
malted
for
me
but
has
its
nice
point
would
recommend
for
malt
lovers
for
the
record
my
bottle
says
7
3
so
i
guess
its
been
ratcheted
up
a
bit
since
first
introduction
as
a
side
note
the
bottle
specifically
denotes
an
alcohol
percentage
of
7
3
and
not
6
5
d
overall
a
very
sweet
malty
xmas
beer
with
a
very
smooth
alcohol
warming
and
fruitiness
with
warm
spiciness
that
made
for
an
enjoyable
drink
overall
experience
to
experience
what
belgium
has
to
offer
if
given
the
chance
is
a
nice
experience
in
and
of
its
self
quite
enjoyable
this
one
was
drinkability
a
great
belgian
beer
lots
of
burn
on
this
one
maybe
it
was
young
i
thin
kat
6
months
this
one
would
be
near
perfect
had
this
ontap
last
night
at
a
local
pizza
joint
it
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
was
a
bit
sour
like
sour
fruit
and
sugar
taste
was
good
like
dried
cherries
pears
and
oranges
with
some
nutty
afternotes
this
style
is
not
my
favorite
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
highly
drinkable
and
one
that
i
would
try
again
danother
over
the
top
beer
at
the
vsk
hazelnut
color
with
offwhite
head
aromas
of
dark
fruit
and
tart
cherry
flavors
of
sour
cherry
fruit
and
juicy
caramel
malt
i
couldnt
tell
if
this
was
spoiled
or
a
flemish
brown
type
beer
because
nobody
at
the
bar
new
what
it
was
and
had
no
info
the
category
it
is
assigned
on
ba
doesnt
shed
much
light
either
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
really
wish
the
brewery
would
have
left
out
the
gueze
or
lambic
or
whatever
heshe
added
d
awesome
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
a
deepr
redbrown
color
from
the
tap
into
a
goblet
style
glass
the
head
was
very
very
light
but
i
noticed
that
most
of
the
beers
poured
at
this
particular
event
were
like
this
and
made
me
suspect
it
was
some
type
of
glass
cleaner
that
was
destroying
the
head
and
not
the
beer
the
aroma
was
a
very
gentile
caramel
with
an
unidentifiable
fruit
hinden
behind
the
flavor
was
malty
at
first
but
changed
as
it
warmed
into
an
ale
fruitiness
light
mouthfeel
and
good
flavor
left
me
satisfied
that
this
was
a
good
choice
to
try
something
new
if
you
see
it
ask
to
try
it
you
may
wind
up
getting
a
full
glass
shortly
thereafter
drinkability
easy
drinking
for
the
style
as
lower
alcohol
levels
and
nice
sweetness
are
easy
on
the
tastebuds
seek
this
out
the
beer
was
served
into
a
tulip
glass
and
come
out
with
a
nice
deep
brown
body
with
a
little
tan
head
trailing
it
the
beer
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
aroma
to
it
with
a
touch
of
maybe
caramel
as
well
the
taste
has
a
nice
balance
of
the
bitter
hop
taste
which
i
love
and
a
little
sweetness
that
backs
up
the
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
carbonation
but
not
overdone
i
enjoyed
letting
the
beer
sit
a
bit
and
warm
up
in
my
glass
a
nice
treat
on
a
cold
night
got
this
on
tap
at
the
old
bay
in
new
brunswick
nj
on
the
menu
it
says
one
of
only
two
bars
in
the
country
that
have
this
on
tap
but
im
not
too
sure
how
acurate
that
is
but
anyhow
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
a
copper
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
the
smell
was
somewhat
fuity
with
some
roasted
malts
taste
is
a
little
hoppy
somewhat
sweet
as
well
a
little
spicy
but
not
much
alcohol
is
somewhat
present
but
doesnt
take
control
drinkability
is
ok
because
the
abv
isnt
that
high
served
on
tap
at
grand
cru
in
baltimore
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
this
is

deep
burgany

which
takes
on
some
purplish
hues
when
held
up
to
the
light
solid
beige
cap
of
head
some
delicate
lacing
nose
is
a
slight
roasted
malt
with
a
caramel
note
and
some
slight
apple
fruitiness
taste
is
a
nice
smooth
malt
some
mild
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
a
touch
of
spices
and
a
decently
bitter
finish
very
nice
delicate
flavors
in
this
one
as
it
warms
some
light
fruitiness
starts
to
come
through
medium
bodied
with
a
very
fine
creamy
carbonation
this
is
a
very
pleasant
sipping
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
little
offering
good
complexity
for
such
a
light
beer
very
tasty
and
fun

drink

retains
the

character
rustic
character
that
is
evident
in
both
the

i
only
have
the
one

but
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
bottledconditioned
brew
ages
given
the
best
before
date
some
3
years
hence
not
bad
not
good
like
the
blonde
better
overall
this
is
one
sweet
smooth
drinking
beer
i
believe
you
could
call
it
sessionable
overall
a
really
good
beer
overall
an
outstanding
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
and
again
the
look
is
deep
caramel
but
not
cloudy
i
love
the
mouthfeel
for
this
style
it
is
crisp
not
overcarbonated
and
fairly
smooth
however
i
thought
it
was
a
tad
sweet
i
was
expecting
some
sweetness
from
the
caramel
malts
but
the
balance
between
the
bitter
and
sweet
was
rough
at
first
sip
sweet
hickory
was
blasted
onto
the
middle
of
my
palate
followed
with
a
bitter
chocolate
towards
the
back
of
the
palate
overall
a
good
brew
not
one
that
i
would
buy
again
belgian
brune
simple
beer
without
more
there
is
just
one
problem
with
this
beer
the
bottle
is
too
small
d
best
belgian
dark
ale
around
decent
brown
ale
as
you
would
expect
from
this
iconic
brewery
not
in
the
same
class
as
chimay
blue
however
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
is
an
amazing
brown
ale
creamy
smooth
wonderful
while
on
business
travel
in
luxembourg
the
leffe
brown
was
a
welcome
companion
its
nutty
full
flavor
comfortable
brown
invitation
and
smooth
full
taste
made
dinners
something
to
remember
all
beer
experiences
are
colored
by
the
when
and
where
we
drink
them
this
was
a
perfect
storm
of
circumstance
and
beer
delicious
i
like
this
beer
and
will
look
forward
to
my
next
drink
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
carmel
tasting
beer
and
very
medium
body
overall
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
again
and
again
i
tend
to
enjoy
sweeter
maltier
beers
and
this
is
definitely
a
style
i
will
like
again
it
also
seems
to
hold
up
well
in
the
bottle
overall
3

it
is
a
nice
belgian
beer
and
has
a
very
festive
quality
to
it
i
just
get
this
picture
of
a
belgian
speaking
housewife
making
desserts
for
her
husbands
friends
is
that
weird
i
dunno
try
it
for
yourself
it
is
by
all
means
a
satisfying
beer
and
i
have
enjoyed
it
i
expect
to
acquire
more
but
there
are
others
that
id
reach
for
its
just
not
that
memorable
accompanies
sushi
quite
nicely
o
enjoyable
dubbel
with

overall
one
of
the
better
belgian
dark
ales
ive
had
lightly
sweet
with
a
belgian
yeasty
taste
very
similar
to
blonde
leffe
but
contains
a
slightly
toasted
taste
worth
returning
to
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
an
improvement
on
the
blonde
less
sweetness
and
nice
dry
finish
solid
basic
belgian
abbey
ale
heavy
lingering
caramel
notes
a
tad
sweet
o
decent
belgian
worth
trying
was
excited
to
give
this
twoyearold
leffe
a
try
it
poured
a
medium
dark
amber
color
with
little
to
no
head
but
that
may
have
been
because
i
was
pouring
from
a
dayold
growler
and
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
very
carbonated
beer
in
the
first
place
the
nose
is
sweet
almost
raisiny
and
has
the
tiniest
hint
of
nuttiness
the
previous
reviewer
who
mentioned
root
beer
was
spoton
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
surprisingly
sweet
almost
unappealingly
so
at
first
and
none
of
the
nuttiness
in
the
nose
translated
onto
the
palate
it
had
a
perfectly
fine
but
not
exceptional
mouthfeel
the
finish
was
fast
and
slightly
sour
i
was
bummed
i
wasnt
enjoying
it
more
as
a
sipping
beer
and
after
some
pondering
decided
to
pair
it
with
a
few
mild
and
sweetish
cheeses
havarti
mild
cheddar
and
some
of
sargentos
new
zealander
that
made
a
huge
difference
the
sweetness
calmed
down
and
more
nuttiness
and
yeastiness
popped
out
and
i
even
poured
a
second
small
glass
i
think
this
is
an
ok
beer
and
i
might
seek
it
out
if
i
was
looking
for
something
to
serve
with
a
cheese
plate
or
other
sweetsavory
appetizers
probably
wont
buy
again
though
othis
is
a
decent
brew
with
some
interesting
flavors
but
nothing
spectacular
the
root
beerginger
bread
flavors
are
interesting
but
the
lack
of
complexity
and
the
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
hurt
the
scores
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
at
the
price
point
i
would
consider
it
an
excellent
value
particularly
for
those
interested
in
breaking
into
abbey
ales
ill
be
buying
this
again
and
will
definitely
use
it
as
a
lower
cost
fix
for
when
ive
got
a
hankering
for
a
belgian
dark
of
some
sort
overall
great
experience
nice
beer
maybe
this
was
the
one
my
cousin
brought
back
for
me
will
definitely
get
this
again
the
taste
is
rich
thick
with
hops
and
balanced
notes
of
malt
a
slight
but
pleasant
bitterness
appears
at
the
end
refreshing
but
still
kind
of
a
heavy
beer
rich
smooth
sweet
brown
and
blonde
fantastic
fluffy
head
not
too
thick
but
full
bodied
so
you
know
that
youre
drinking
and
not
sipping
flavored
water
theres
a
delicious
underlying
light
caramel
its
the
dessert
and
appetizer
all
wrapped
up
together
leffe
brown
had
a
caramelmalt
smell
but
not
in
an
appealing
way
i
found
myself
shying
away
from
smelling
it
again
as
for
the
taste
its
like
a
sweet
caramel
brown
ale
but
it
just
failed
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
and
thats
really
saying
something
i
got
maybe
a
quarter
through
it
and
said
it
taste
too
bad
for
me
to
want
to
finish
im
stuck
with
five
left
so
maybe
the
second
time
around
ill
enjoy
it
more
but
this
beer
was
awful
o
not
bad
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
as
i
do
not
particularly
care
for
leffe
blonde
belgian
strong
darks
are
among
my
favorites
so
this
was
not
much
of
a
change
i
will
have
this
again
mf
thin
medium
light
body
medium
dry
good
carbonation
provides
some
sharpness
on
the
palate
2
75
its
creamy
and
a
bit
crisp
on
the
tongue
combining
with
the
tartness
that
translates
into
a
bit
of
a
tingle
the
body
is
a
light
medium
better
than
the
blonde
version
but
still
not
my
favourite
leffe
enjoy
not
the
strongest
or
most
complex
belgian
dark
but
very
enjoyable
330
ml
bottle
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
white
longlasting
head
aromas
were
of
nice
burnt
caramel
burnt
sugar
and
maybe
some
chocolate
the
taste
was
more
or
less
the
same
with
the
alcohol
present
carbonation
was
medium
and
the
body
was
light
to
medium
a
little
disappointing
for
a
dubbel
didnt
got
the
characteristics
of
the
style
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
once
again
with
leffe
i
have
never
tried
this
brown
so
i
was
hoping
it
was
better
than
the
blond
nope
poured
at
40
degrees
beer
was
very
pretty
i
must
admit
with
a
giant
head
mahogany
color
mmmi
thought
but
as
soon
as
i
smelled
it
i
knew
it
was
that
same
sour
beer
we
hate
dont
understand
it
either
my
wife
spent
a
year
in
holland
and
loved
this
beer
on
tap
when
she
got
back
here
to
va
we
started
buying
it
and
first
sip
she
took
was
yuk
and
we
have
tried
several
times
hoping
it
was
just
a
bad
or
old
beer
i
dont
know
maybe
the
export
product
is
not
the
same
as
the
beer
overseas
dont
matter
i
will
never
again
waste
money
to
try
it
anymore
unless
we
find
it
on
tap
o
3

i
rarely
give
a
rating
this
low
for
a
genre
of
beer
that
i
like
so
much
i
liked
this
when
i
first
had
it
but
its
just
not
that
good
a
4
s4
t
3
m3
25
o
3

a
very
pleasant
surprise
given
that
this
falls
under
the
inbev
umbrella
and
is
brewed
at
a
commercial
brewery
at
the
excellent
price
of
under
8
a
sixer
this
is
as
close
to
a
solid
everyday
belgian
ale
as
there
is
spicy
nose
and
tangy
aftertaste
this
seems
to
be
a
staple
of
french
bistro
kind
of
places
ill
have
to
taste
this
again
this
is
better
than
i
remember
from
the
bottled
version
sampled
from
a
33cl
bottle
brown
with
some
light
coming
through
and
a
small
head
of
large
bubbles
aroma
has
black
pepper
nuts
bread
and
a
hint
of
prunes
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
varied
blend
of
raisins
prunes
biscuits
black
pepper
and
plums
body
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
moderately
high
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
especially
flavorful
or
adventurous
but
i
enjoy
it
a
flavorful
brown
ale
that
comes
across
a
little
heavy
yet
packed
with
lots
of
great
malt
flavors
hop
bitterness
and
aroma
are
hard
to
detect
but
rich
malt
flavors
abound
o
a
good
abbey
ale
i
would
not
buy
it
again
however
due
to
the
slightly
unpleasant
odor
highly
carbonated
beer
with
a
brown
colored
head
and
a
deep
brown
color
it
does
appear
pretty
clear
in
the
light
the
nose
is
a
bit
faint
but
is
still
fairly
enticing
with
some
belgian
yeast
and
candy
sugar
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
oilybut
creamy
the
taste
seems
a
bit
fleeting
and
underwhelming
for
a
belgian
beer
just
some
peppery
belgian
yeast
that
grows
in
intensity
in
the
aftertaste
theres
a
bit
of
growing
warmth
with
in
the
finish
overall
a
good
belgian
dark
not
massively
overcomplicated
but
heavy
in
sweet
malt
and
treacle
flavours
pretty
decent
for
au70
a
case
2013
figured
it
would
be
a
fair
bit
more
than
that
definitely
more
of
a
sipping
beer
than
a
sessional
o
it
pleased
me
a
lot
good
surprise
a
tasty
belgian
brown
sweet
with
malts
slighlty
overstepping
the
yeast
solid
yeast
good
carbonation
glad
to
have
found
this
while
in

and
caicos
o
overall
a
good
enjoyable
dark
belgian
ale
i
liked
it
but
it
probably
isnt
something
id
look
to
buy
again
o
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
i
definitely
prefer
this
to
the

as
with

not

again
its
out

so
ill
have
to
try
it
again
my
first
impression
is
of
a
good
but
not
exceptional
beer
o
good
drinkability
easy
beer
a
bit
warming
too
nice
winter
beer
from
the
33
cl
bottle
purchased
in
namur
belgium
in
spite
of
this
being
another
inbev
industrial
product
they
dont
even
say
where
it
was
brewed
its
quite
drinkable
and
grows
more
interesting
as
you
sip
oexpected
more
from
leffe
and
christmas
alebut
in
all
its
good
will
try
again
as
it
is
overall
a
nice
dark
ale
not
a
bad
beer
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
terribly
impressive
beer
o
boring
it
is
beer
but
boring
t
not
impressed
but
i
would
drink
it
again
jd
from
my
notes
found
this
beer
in
a
supermarket
in
brussels
in
2009
one
month
later
i
poured
it
in
my
leffe
glass
the
beer
poured
a
brown
amber
color
with
a
longlasting
white
head
smell
was
spicy
clove
caramel
and
apple
taste
was
similar
to
the
smellbut
very
weak
and
watery
mouthfeel
was
thin
overall
i
think
there
are
many
less
watery
belgium
xmas
beer
on
the
market
a
let
down
the
warm
light
flavors
of
cinnamon
and
apple
are
an
appealing
mix
for
cold
winter
days
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
apples
and
cinnamon
somewhat
surprisingly
the
beer
smells
a
lot
like
freshbaked
apple
pie
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
caramel
and
toffee
malts
as
well
as
some
dark
fruit
apples
cinnamon
and
sugar
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation

very

overall
ok
but
strange
the
way
it
changed
completely
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
drink
it
cold
it
seems
to
me
that
this
beer
has
no
character
it
is
rather
ordinary
and
forgettable
belgian
ale
but
it
sure
looks
good
tasted
good
with
a
spicy
start
but
a
mild
finish
felt
good
in
the
mouth
if
a
little
watery
than
my
liking
for
a
cold
weather
beer
bottle
poured
a
clear
medium
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
candi
sugar
and
fruity
ester
is
ok
for
style
though
i
have
smell
better
taste
is
also
a
nice
enough
mix
between
some
candi
sugar
notes
with
some
light
belgian
malt
with
light
notes
of
fruity
ester
body
is
too
light
for
style
with
medium
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
ok
at
best
but
i
must
admit
to
having
tasted
better
belgian
christmas
beer
in
my
life
fruity
aromas
on
the
nose
soft
touch
of
alcohol
that
is
reminiscent
of
the
liquor
both
spicy
on
the
nose
than
taste
there
also
collects
cloves
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
but
still
hot
although
it
is
somewhat
artificial
this
flavor
is
persistent
and
unfortunately
far
from
appetizing
a
christmas
beer
that
has
many
shortcomings
in
matters
of
taste
taste
is
spicy
with
the
spice
as
described
above
with
the
addition
of
traces
of
oxidatrion
and
a
strong
fresh
wood
taste
a
real
holiday
spirit
beer
but
in
my
opinion
a
bit
too
much
of
the
spices
and
higher
alcohols
and
woddy
taste
drinkability
christmas
beer
correct
but
without
more
served

an

had
over

still
thats

de

enjoy
a

beer
but
no
real
wow
here
this
was
part
of
a
mixed
6
pack
of
belgian
ales
and
to
this
point
this
is
perhaps
the
one
i
am
least
enthused
about
i
am
holding
out
hope
for
the
last
two
overall
really
nice
pleasantly
surprised
after
being
let
down
a
little
bit
by
the
blonde
because
of
the
sweetness
and
use
of
cherries
and
chocolates
was
reminiscent
of
a
cross
between
a
belgian
dark
ale
and
a
dubbel
very
fine
stuff
indeed
im
surprised
with
how
much
i
liked
this
but
suffice
to
say
the
flavor
does
not
match
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
at
all
and
the
caramelappleclove
combo
becomes
a
bit
too
onedimension
in
the
long
run
nevertheless
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
throw
me
back
and
forth
and
i
wouldnt
mind
experimenting
with
aging
a
few
more
of
their
dark
beers
which
i
am
such
as
gulden
draak
recommended
o
excellent
but
short
of
world
class
o
nothing
i
would
club
baby
seals
to
find
again
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
was
not
amazing
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
not
but
maybe
d
a
nice
drinking
brew
solid
for
style
overall
nice
wellrounded
belgian
dark
sweet
but
not
overtly
so
allowing
for
a
nice
drinkable
and
approachable
brew
i
could
definitely
stand
to
drink
another
one
overall
another
hit
from
this
brewery
the
belgians
know
what
they
are
doing
i
can
see
pairing
this
with
cured
meats
heavy
cheeses
pears
and
blackberries

lovely
thing

notes
lots

a
spicy
taste
complemented
by
a
sweet

finish
o
i
freaking
loved
this
and
this
is
the
best
example
of
an
underrated
style
that
i
have
sampled
personally
i
appriciated
the
lack
of
overpowering
barnyard
funk
common
to
many
a
belgian
its
there

it
doesnt
dominate

the
brew
itself
is
a
brownishmahogany
hue
with
a
slight
haziness
nose
expresses
dull
prune
notes
and
a
slight
yeastiness
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
flavors
are
a
bit
muted
but
a
slightly
vinous
character
is
revealed
towards
the
back
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
slight
acidity
overall
a
decent
bsda
but
not
much
complexity
there
are
definitely
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
the
taste
begins
sweet
and
malty
with
a
kind
of
peppery
low
to
moderate
bitterness
hanging
on
at
the
end
but
not
for

likable
all
around
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
goblet
no
bottle

but
i
bought
these
in
november
this
pours
a
fizzy
lightly
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
decent
off
white
tan
color
which
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
dark
fruit
and
candied
sugar
minimal
hop
presence
the
feel
is
medium
with
high
carbonination
the
taste
is
quite
good
you
get
the
sweet
candied
sugar
and
loads
of
malts
but
this
is
a
very
dry
beer
which
makes
an
interesting
combination
o
overall
this
beer
is
just
somewhat
lacking
appearance
is
awesome
smell
is
good
taste
is
bland
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
would
definitely
drink
it
if
offered
to
me
though
not
bad
just
not
good
o
i
find
this
beer
enjoyable
and
dismissible
at
the
same
time
or
shall
i
say
neither
neither
here
nor
there
a
pretty
decent
taste
good
within
itself
with
roasted
malt
taste
that
differ
from
there
american
counterparts
worth
a

solid
brown
ale

beer
that
is

and

pretty

but
fairly
easy
to

overall
im

with
this
beer
although
it
isnt
one
of
their
best
it
would
be
the

for
a

o
this
is

beer
nothing

with
it
and
i

to
have
it
again
in

overall
i
dont

very
much
this
beer
this
brewery
a
lot
more
to
offer
in
the

beers
overall
this
is

it

dark
ale
totempole
that
it
really
doesnt
even
warrant
mention
this
was
not
my
first
time
trying
it
but
it
likely
will
have
been
my
last
none
in
the
augustijn
series
impressed
me
however
reasonable
the
price
i
guarantee
you
belgium
offers
better
brands
at
the
similar
cost
beautiful
ruby
red
also
picked
from
the
sampler
pack
usually
the
samplers
arent
all
that
great
but
these
have
all
been
firsts
for
me
except
for
the
gulden
draak
and
i
was
wary
from
the
beginning
nice
looking
head
which
diminished
quickly
with
lacing
fine
bubbles
of
carbonation
ba
has
this
listed
as
a
7
but
the
bottle
says
8
previous
reviewer
hit
it
on
the
head
strong
newcastle
with
belgian
yeast
so
happy
with
the
the
sampler
pack
i
went
back
and
bought
another
one
for
a
friend
except
now
im
drinking
it
overall
this
is
a
solid
belgian
dark
clean
and
drinkable
well
crafted
malt
profile
but
not
super
complex
recommended
to
any
fan
of
belgian
ales
or
fans
of
bocks
and
brown
ales
that
want
to
try
something
different
cheers
overall
having
this
after
a
long
day
of
work
makes
me
appreciate
a
descent
beer
it
is
not
going
to
blow
you
out
the
water
but
i
think
in
the
end
you
will
like
its
quality
salud
overall
solidly
above
average
belgian
dark
ale
it
has
more
character
than
say
leffe
brune
but
lacks
that
beers
reasonably
strong
leather
and
clove
type
flavorsaromas
i
generally
prefer
that
end
of
the
bda
bsda
spectrum
to
sweet
fruit
bombs
like
this
one
but
this
beer
is
bold
and
wellput
together
enough
to
be
enjoyable
regardless
overall
a
very
nice
beer
not
bad
has
an
easygoing
wellrounded
character
that
goes
down
nicely
lacks
depth
perhaps
a
little
sweet
with
an
excessively
boozy
finish
but
no
major
complaints
nothing
special
but
worth
trying
poured
with
little
head
beautiful
amber
ruby
color
scents
of
alcohol
yeast
and
over
ripe
grapes
cherries
tastes
like
dark
malts
raisins
brown
sugar
thin
mouth
feel
water
like
overall
not
a
bad
beer
its
like
a
session
beer
in
the
chimay
style
d
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
as
a
brune
but
enjoyable
with
the
sour
taste
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
not
a
bad
deal
if
its
included
in
a
mixed
augustijn
6pack
clear
brown
thin
ecru
head
of
tiny
bubbles
caramel
treacle
and
coffee
dregs
the
finish
is
slightly
balanced
toward
a
subtle
brown
sugar
sweetness
as
opposed
to
the
light
earthy
bitterness
that
hangs
on
at
the
finish
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
compared
to
the
augustijn
blonde
helps
showcase
the
maltiness
very
nice
looking
beer
with
a
rich
oftwhite
colored
head
and
extreme
lacing
down
the
beer
pours
an
outstanding
dark
bold
color
scents
of
cherries
apricots
cranberry
and
belgian
yeast
and
sugar
tastes
like
tart
cherries
and
candied
sugar
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
medium
bodied
but
yet
very
light
in
the
fold
it
will
be
revisited
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
little
thin
in
all
respects
though
not
unpleasant
in
any
way
overall
above
average
seek
it
out
for
an
introduction
to
the
style
dont
seek
this
out
if
you
are
looking
for
something
complex
such
as
brother
thelonius
by
north
coast
naturally
try
this
for
an
introduction
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
fans
of
the
style
should
definitely
give
this
one
a
go
if
youre
not
a
fan
however
avoid
as
theres
nothing
special
enough
to
justify
the
purchase

pretty
good

drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good

overall
the
beer
had
an
interesting
taste
from
the
wood
flavour
while
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
occurrence
im
happy
i
gave
it
a
try
m
thin
with
lively
carbonation
imagined
it
would
be
heavier
than
this

appeared
a

on

thats
a

crispier

fizzier
than
id
hope
for
once
the
carbonation
dies
down
the
body
is
still
too
thin
for
my
liking
still
enjoyable
and
this
could
work
well
with
some
food
pairings
id
gather
overall
another
nice
offering
from
van
steenberge
its
not
the
most
outstanding
belgian
dark
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
this
is
a
dark
amber
beer
with
a
nice
ratio
of
foam
this
is
beer
has
a
noneventful
smell
some
what
disapointing
mouthfeel
is
full
of
bubbles
and
that
is
being
proper
the
taste
is
very
well
nice
there
are
hints
of
roasting
and
a
nice
hoppy
mix
we
like
it
overall
the
smell
and
taste
do
not
match
but
do
not
let
that
get
in
the
way
of
having
one
pours
a
cola
brown
color
with
modest
sized

surprisingly
modest
compared
to
many
belgians
nose

some
dark

a
nice
musty

palate
a
black

element
is
there
some
light
caramel
and
a
light
body
finish
is
light
with
more
black
tea
and
i
find
this
ale
is
very
drinkable

this

quite
a

from
the
golden
dubbles

so

of
us
are
accustomed
to

the

overall
the

seem
to
make
some
impact
not
bad
but
all
in
all
slightly
boring
to
my
taste
not
disappointing
at
all
really
from
a
stubby
bottle
into
a
small
snifter

a
rich
brown
with
an
off

a
nice
abbey
brew
authentic
and
very
much
a
true
belgian
overall
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
dark
ale
maybe
lacks
body
but
flavours
compensate
for
that
d
although
the
beer
is
sweet
its
not
entirely
difficult
to
drink
because
the
sweetness
isnt
cloying
and
is
balanced
to
some
degree
by
the
spices
d
average
drinkability
i
wouldnt
be
bummed
if
this
is
was
the
only
beer
at
a
party
but
certainly
wouldnt
want
it
to
be
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
belgian
dark
ale
a
nose
that
evokes
esters
and
roasted
malts
that
offer
good
odor
smell
the
palate
is
sweet
without
being
lightweight
and
offers
especially
in
the
finish
a
spice
that
is
not
uninteresting
and
offers
a
taste
of
some
spices
on
the
tongue

fairly
drinkable
beer
for
its
type
without

wonder
of

i
found
it
strangely

it
is
very
sugary
and
would
make
a
nice

brew

compared
against

it

the

got

a
good

that
i
got
from

last

good
to
know
it
held
up
for
over
a
year
a
have
two
other
styles
from
the
brewery
that
i
am
looking
forward
to
this
week
some
kind
of
sourness
in
the

makes
me
deciding
not
to
finish

glass
it

alcohol
is

well
with
only
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
dark
ale
i
would
not
mind
having
it
again
sometime
overall
a
very
fullflavoured
beer
for
the
abv
recommended
o
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
think
if
i
happen
upon
it
again
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
im
simply
not
in
love
with
this
beer
its
not
that
bad
but
it
sort
of
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
the
appearance
is
pretty
normal
for
belgian
dark
ale
tight
bubbles
dissipate
quickly
and
leave
little
in
the
way
of
a
head
the
smell
is
nice
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
it
comes
out
smell
of
vanilla
and
spice
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
not
too
bad
but
left
a
little
of
an
off
taste
on
the
palate
overall
not
a
bad
dark
some
good
qualities
but
pretty
middle
of
the
road
o
worth
trying
but
not
a
regular
beer
to
seek
out
i
acutally
liked
it
as
part
of
a
belgian
sampling
with
dinner
treat
it
as
such
this
beer
needs
some
body
desperately
it
drinks
like
overly
sweet
vaguely
malty
water
im
not
too
impressed
o
this
beer
has
some
nice
flavor
and
depth
but
it
is
pretty
soft
and
turns
watery
and
thin
the
fizz
really
covers
a
lot
of
the
character
as
the
beer
opens
d
a
great
belgian
dark
ale
smooth
and
rich
yet
clean
and
refreshing
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
a
decent
but
not
outstanding
drop
overall
lack
of
excitement
does
not
equal
lack
of
appreciation
it
is
an
okay
dark
ale
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
really
this
is
ridiculously
sweet
relies
too
much
on
candi
sugar
decent
belgian
dark
but
there
are
many
more
beers
that
i
would
pass
this
brew
over
for
d
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
definitely
want
to
try
this
again
because
i
like
the
combination
of
sweetness
and
flavors
of
dark
fruits
the
beer
was
smooth
and
non
abrasive
in
other
words
the
carbonation
was
on
the
lower
end
as
i
finished
the
glass
i
noticed
thin
streaks
of
lacing
randomly
dotting
the
glass
i
am
a
big
fan
of
belgian
beers
but
i
can
confidently
say
this
is
my
least
favourite
of
them
all
not
bad
but
the
least
favourite
till
now
maybe
i
will
give
it
another
shot
after
a
month
or
so
and
see
if
there
is
a
variance
in
my
experience
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
overall
a
good
hearty
and
warming
paters
beer
them
monks
got
class
pours

medium

with

dark
brown
body
with
some
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
nose
is
hard
to
break
down
though
the
belgian
yeast
in
noticeable
i
picked
up
raisins
molasses
and
faint
hops
the
taste
is
quite
complex
lots
of
dark

raisins
dark
cherries

a

hops
are

could
have
used

a
medium

not
sticky

is
quite
high
a
relatively
low

was
glad
to
have
this
quite
rare
tap
version
though
not
something
id
have
again
md
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
drinkable
but
a
little
weak
for
my
likeing
especially
at
6
abv
would
like
a
little
more
of
everything
drinkability
decent
price
fits
the
style
somewhat
may
be
missing
some
berrydark
fruits
action
doesnt
stand
out
from
others
of
the
same
style
but
most
likely
enjoyable
to
people
who
like
other
beers
from
the
same
brewery
conclusion
this
showed
promise
at
first
but
the
odd
sharp
flavors
on
the
finish
kinda
ratchet
this
one
down
i
honestly
rarely
do
this
a
couple
times
a
year
but
i
made
it
through
about
23
of
this
the
rest
is
quite
sadly
going
down
the
drain
not
my
favourite
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
more
then
that
kind
of
average
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
or
medicinal
not
really
much
to
count
off
for
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
drinkable
enough
but
i
wouldnt
recomend
paying
for
more
than
one
of
these
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
grassy
with
dust
caramel
and
lightly
fruity
the
appearance
is
amber
brown
with
a
foamy
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
good
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
caramel
malt
the
palate
is
thin
but
ok
the
finish
is
a
touch
metallic
overall
i
like
it
ugh
i
had
a
bottle
in
watou
and
found
the
same
disappointing
metallic
flavor
that
i
assumed
was
a
oneoff
flaw
in
the
blonde
alas
otherwise
its
a
coollooking
ruddy
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
in
the
chalice
the
aroma
and
malt
flavor
are
a
sweet
and
very
smooth
complex
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
bit
of
raisin
the
metal
was
less
prevalent
in
this
beer
but
no
less
shameful
overall
a
sweet
malt
heavy
beer
thats
decent
but
nothing
special
not
something
id
turn
down
but
also
not
something
id
go
looking
for
average
md
slightly
soursweet
and
thinish
in
the
finishing
touch
due
to
the
residual
sugary
touch
while
the
carbonation
goes
light
and
suitable
for
such
a
lightflavoured
dubbel
this
is
a
simple
not
simplistic
ale
that
is
easydrinking
and
reasonably
delicious
with
a
certain
depth
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
het
kapittel
beers
that
i
rated
this
week
worth
a
try
rated
nov
28
2008
poured
into
my
ommegang
chalice
looks
like
a
decent
dubbel
head
swells
to
12
in
and
falls
quickly
to
reveal
a
few
lines
of
sticky
lacing
looks
like
a
breakfast
roast
coffee
with
slight
translucency
mild
carbonation
it
smells
like
big
chocolate
malt
biscuit
and
candi
sugar
no
hop
smell
just
sweetness
the
taste
is
pleasant
yet
out
of
balance
the
sweetness
tastes
good
but
there
is
very
very
little
hop
dryness
or
complex
alcohol
to
round
it
out
this
would
be
great
with
just
a
little
kick
of
saaz
at
the
end
and
maybe
a
slightly
lower
final
gravity
this
would
be
a
wonderful
base
for
something
that
could
be
amazing
i
would
like
to
get
ahold
of
the
recipe
and
give
it
just
a
little
tweak
d
easy
to
drink
low
abv
nothing
really
exciting
about
this
beer
to
speak
of
solid
belgian
dark
ale
this
beer
is
darn
good
and
improves
as
it
warms
to
allow
flavors
to
be
released
d
nice
double
style
flavorful
beer
id
have
again
probably
better
examples
of
the
style
priced
right
d
quite
drinkable
for
a
belgian
at
only
6
abv
a
very
enjoyable
brew
not
to
expensive
id
like
to
try
a
newer
bottle
of
this
to
compare
overall
this
was
an
ok
beer
although
not
something
i
would
want
more
than
a
couple
of
at
one
time
overall
very
nice
beer
well
balanced
and
highly
recommended
from
a
kapittel
giftpack
that
included
four
beers
from
a
morris
county
liquor
store
this
beer
pours
an
attractive
bronzecopper
appearance
with
impressive
foamy
head
a
sweetsmelling
caramel
flavored
beer
with
belgian
sugars
replete
with
a
malty
thick
rich
flavor
that
is
really
satisfying
really
liked
this
brew
hits
home
with
a
thick
rich
satisfying
taste
good
mouthfeel
with
easy
drinkability
for
a
relatively
low
alcohol
percentage
goes
down
very
smooth
tastes
like
buttered
caramel

toffee

stuff
recommended

dissipated
quickly
and
left
ample
residue
as
it
subsided
scent
of
malt
and
dark
fruit
figs
prunes
and
raisins
as
well
as
a
mild
hint
of
alcohol
color
was
rubybrownred
not
quite
opaque
but
very
dark
with
little
light
penetration
mouthfeel
was
watery
flat
and
lacked
any
liveliness
which
was
quite
surprising
considering
the
head
flavor
was
lackluster
and
the
nose
poorly
translated
into
flavor
in
terms
of
drinkability
you
can
certainly
drink
quite
a
few
in
a
sitting
but
not
really
worth
the
effort
as
there
are
better
representations
of
the
style
out
there
d
a
very
tasty
good
quality
belgian
dark
beer
the
pater
is
definitely
the
favourite
of
the
3
beers
i
have
had
from
the
het

brand
definitely
a
repeat
buy
when
i
go
back
up
to

d
i
think
its
worth
a
try
its
good
for
a
couple
of
drinks
drinkability
im
not
a
good
judge
of
belgian
beers
but
i
like
this
stuff
which
probably
means
real
waffleheads
dont
like
it
but
the
rest
of
us
would
find
it
a
good
introduction
to
belgian
styles
overall
impression
very
complex
beer
crazy
complexity
with
a
different
flavor
than
i
have
ever
tried
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
you
wont
be
disappointed
taste
is
caramellic
and
sweet
malty
with
no
room
for
any
bitterness
only
a
very
low
bitterness
to
support
the
malt
liquorice
and
a
light
roast
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
body
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
with
some
sweet
malty
caramel
which
lingers
great
caramel
color
aroma
and
flavor
lack
of
overall
depth
in
the
latter
two
though
keeps
the
beer
from
being
outstanding
balance
between
the
low
alcohol
and
sweetness
is
just
about
perfect
the
depth
they
did
achieve
is
probably
about
as
much
as
you
can
get
in
a
6
belgian
very
very
very
easy
to
drink
an
evening
of
these
would
be
nothing
to
complain
about
mouth
very
small
strong
carbonation
immediately
tickling
the
tip
of
my
tongue
good
milk
chocolate
flavor
all
the
way
through
accented
by
some
watermelon
taste
and
a
finish
of
roast
malt
the
middle
of
the
mouth
seems
under
stimulated
but
i
really
enjoy
everything
else
a
bit
of
metalicity
but
maybe
because
its
very
cold
purchased
park

liquors
lancaster
ca
oelergud
decent
belgian
dark
nice
frothy
pour
sticky
lace
strong
aromas
of
dried
fruits
currants
raisin
and
a
great
spicy
balance
not
too
sweet
but
definately
a
presence
of
caramel
sugars
nice
finish
with
an
oily
hop
profile
which
allows
the
spicy
sweetness
to
continue
to
the
end
not
as
dynamic
as
others
of
the
style
but
a
refreshing
intro
to
the
dark
belgians
d
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
the
low
abv
and
subdued
sweetness
make
this
an
easy
drinker
i
felt
this
was
very
average
poured
a
reddish
brown
colour
with
a
huge
sandy
blonde
head
that
dissolved
into
a
thin
blanket
of
frost
in
about
40
seconds
smell
was
both
malty
and
candy
sweet
and
a
bit
sour
as
well
taste
was
a
bit
bland
but
not
bad
short
stint
of
bitterness
shows
up
in
the
middle
for
a
split
second
not
a
terrible
brew
just
very
average
for
the
style
drinkability
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
syrupy
which
matched
well
with
overall
taste
making
it
a
highly
drinkable
sessionable
beer
i
also
enjoyed
the
artwork
on
the
label
4
monks
drinking
a
certified
abby
ale
and
a
great
beer
a
must
try
belgian
highly
recommended
drinkability
remembering
that
this
is
not
a
strong
dark
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
for
the
style
overall
however
it
is
just
a
touch
underattenuated
for
my
tastebuds
faint
malt
aroma
no
hops
to
speak
of

a

with

found
this

to

yummy
what

like

have

id
say
this
beer
is
ok
pretty
average
and
noncomplex
pours
a
clear
deep
ruby
red
with
a
nice
and
tall
head
building
to
two
fingers
in
my
goblet
it
is
a
light
cream
and
is
retained
well
leaving
some
good
lacing
smell
is
rich
and
fruity
but
a
bit
muted
with
notes
of
dark
fruits
and
raisin
spices
and
a
yeasty
backdrop
taste
falls
flat
bitter
spices
and
a
tealike
note
but
where
did
the
fruits
and
yeast
go
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
flat
despite
the
visible
carbonation
rising
drinkability
is
good
but
its
just
not
much
of
a
beer
taste
a
bit
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
and
bread
dough
flavors
going
on
here
as
this
warms
the
belgian
spices
and
fruits
make
an
appearance
along
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
just
a
little
on
the
dry
side
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
id
hoped
it
would
be
better
than
it
turned
out
to
be
it
looked
all
right
i
guess
murky
brown
color
with
some
decent
foam
which
didnt
last
very
long
the
smell
was
more
sour
than
i
expected
i
kind
of
expected
more
of
a
bready
yeast
aroma
like
st
bernardus
pater
the
taste
was
slightly
sour
too
which
didnt
meld
well
with
the
sugars
and
other
flavors
in
the
beer
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
d
good
sipper
might
get
old
fast
d
very
drinkable
it
is
a
bit
strong
but
would
session
well
it
goes
well
with
food
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
pours
nice
dark
amber
thats
murky
and
very
paterish
head
was
a
little
colalike
but
laced
pretty
well
for
me
smells
of
honey
and
grass
with
those
tastes
leading
the
first
sip
middle
bits
are
lemoned
sweet
tea
finishing
off
with
stronger
more
bitter
black
tea
maybe
some
wheat
bread
down
below
all
the
rest
very
syrupy
texture
that
is
as
bereft
of
carbonation
as
possible
without
being
entirely
flat
despite
or
in
light
of
that
though
very
drinkable
no

carved
some
yellowish

soon
falling
to
just
some
loating

of
the

dark
brown
clear
beer
with
red
hint
in
it
nose
is
very
sweet
and
greenmalty
and
having
a
wortnose
oxidation
certainly
did
its
part
in
this
one
and
wonder
if
botlefermentation
was
even
started
taste
is
very
sweet
and
somehow
also
thin
bodied
is
there
sacharine
in
this
product
dunno
but
certainly
sweet
some
caramellic
and
slightly
burnt
maltyness
also
there
but
bitterness
in
my
opinion
low
dosed
even
with
the
bitter
yeasttaste
that
it
also
shows
drinkable
beer
but
not
really
my
type
of
beer
and
imo
misses
something
drinkability
wondering
if
this
is
the
natural
taste
or
did
i
get
one
that
was
starting
to
turn
only
grabbed
one
so
i
dont
have
one
to
compare
against
awkward
and
strange
taste
ill
pass
if
this
is
the
true
taste
not
horrid
but
not
really
pleasing

quaffability
not

going
on
here
in
my
opinion
het
kapittel

certainly
looks
the
part
of
a
quality
belgian
ale
unfortunately
it
tastes
like
the
poor
stepchild
of
belgian
brewing
not
to
denigrate
american
brewers
since
they
brew
my
favorite
beersstyles
but
what
it
really
tastes
like
is
an
attempt
by
a
less
than
talented
american
craft
brewer
to
duplicate
the
belgian
dark
ale
style
while
it
probably
isnt
quite
as
bad
as
ive
made
it
out
to
be
its
certainly
disappointing
at
first
sip
it
may
not
impress
you
and
it
certainly
wont
overwhelm
you
but
this
is
an
easy
drinking
charmer
that
has
just
enough
character
to
keep
you
coming

what
a
find
i
stumbled
onto
this
at
bottleworks
and
couldnt
be
happier
it
was
truly
a
pleasure
to
consume
this
brew
is
made
up
of
a
hazy
amber
body
with
a
bubbly
tan

on
the

good

the
scent
has
some

to
it
the
taste
is
mainly
sweet

with
some
dark

pretty
good
beer
nothing
amazing
but
it
will
do
this
beer
poured
a
dark
red
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
off
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
there
was
surprisingly
very
little
aroma
to
this
beer
what
little
i
could
detect
seemed
to
be
malt
a
flavor
of
malt
caramel
and
some
unidentifiable
spices
the
finish
was
almost
metallic
and
a
touch
astrigent
not
really
impressed
with
this
one
it
pours
a
rubybrown
with
a
ligth
tan
head
and
leaves
some
nice

glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
yeasty
and
spicey
character
in
the
nose
a
metallic
taste
hits
me
up
front
which
is
a
turn
off
it
is
malty
and
there
are
tastes
of
some
dried
fruit
and
it
finishes
with
a
yeast
character
the
aftertaste
almost
reminds
me
of
iced
tea
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
lacks
depth
and
complexity
and
the
metallic
notes
are
not
good
bottle
poured
a
deep
murky

with
a
nice

abv
is

too
omnipresent
but
excellent
carbonation
taste
is
sweet
with
some
quite
complex
mix
of
spice
i
notice
that
some
of
the
other
review
mentioned
a
metallic
taste
which
i
have
heard
of
before
if
i
recall
well
the
metallic
taste
is
from
the
hops
and

a

a

not
a
lot
to

i
dont
have
the

there
is
a

of
malty
sweetness
and
little
else

a
nice
mix
of
sweetness
with
a
slight
bite
the

is
stronger

up

mmm
a
nice
little
beer
for
my
250th
review
thanks
to
my
friend
that
provided
this
one
most
appreciated
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
an
actual
monks
beer
depending
on
whether
you
count
leffe
or
not
and
its
a
unique
experience
not
enough
to
make
me
put
on
the
robes
and
take
the
vows
but
id
have
it
again
cheers
to
the
belgianbum
up
the
road
for
this

het

certainly
a

something
of
a

mixed
with
a
christmas
ale
and
some
wild

brew
i
wasnt

perhaps
sweet
initial

flavors
are
balanced
by
something
of
a
hop
presence
but
also
by
a
masked
acidic
quality
subtle
and
simple
i
find
this
very
drinkable
i
feel
as
though
i
drank
this
too
quickly
to
catch
all
its
subtlties
but
perhaps
not
ill
have
another
in
a
month
or
so
to
see
as
it
sets
in
my
triple
glass
a
transpicuous
deep
amber
to
mahogany
color
the
head
skeletal
and
what
was
there

another

in

might
change
my
mind
average
at
best
john
reminds
me
more
of
a
weak
and
watery
stout
than
a
belgian
this
brew
sampled
on
a
cold
and
snowy
winter
night
is
a
brown
hazy
liquid
the
head
is
thick
white
and
stable
the
aroma
is
a
very
belgian
bubblegum
rich
dark
malt
yeast
pepper
and
spice
and
phenols
nice
the
taste
follows
the
smell
it
is
a
moderately
sweet
very
malty
beer
it
has
a
nice
effervescence
full
body
good
for
a
cold
night
overall
a
tasty
compex
belgian
style
brew
pretty
wellbalanced
no
alcohol
detected
here
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
better
than
youd
think
worth
a
try
for
sure
o
an
interesting
blend
of
the
amber
ale
as
a
belgian
and
a
winter
ale
caught
my
curiosity
i
usually
enjoy
ithacas
offerings
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
enjoyed
the
one
but
i
wont
come
back
to
it
overall
i
would
characterize
this
as
belgianinfluenced
rather
than
belgianstyle
and
while
i
rather
enjoyed
the
beer
i
was
not
fond
of
the
medicinal
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
very
american
and
not
at
all
in
the
belgian
manner
a
good
beer
with
som
promise
this
is
an
original
brew
the
bottle
says
belgian
style
amber
ale
i
would
agree
its
belgian
inspired
but
original
all
on
its
own
as
the
ale
warms
it
offers
more
belgian
flavor
notes
i
really
dig
this
brew
as
its
very
easy
to
drink
i
give
the
ithaca
brewery
credit
for
this
daring
offering
ithaca
cold
front
poured
a
caramel
color
with
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
i
expected
frothy
and
creamy
and
when
i
saw
it
i
checked
and
saw
the
freshness
date
was
close
but
not
past
look
is
cloudy
with
a
a
thin
ring
and
spotty
lacing
nose
is
bready
malty
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
and
nutty
taste
was
terrible
like
stale
peanuts
that
came
out
of
a
tin
can
stale
flat
metallic
had
a
little
resin
and
hop
bitterness
but
the
flavors
were
dead
alcohol
was
right
up
front
on
the
palate
i
rated
it
as
high
as
i
did
because
of
the
fact
that
in
the
6
pack
1
or
2
of
the
bottles
were
just
slightly
better
than
this
it
has
potential
an
okay
beer
drink
warmer
for
a
more
balanced
taste
o
really
interesting
roasted
qualities
that
werent
quite
what
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
this
is
a
good
beer
i
didnt
realize
what
style
this
was
when
i
poured
it
or
i
may
have
considered
an
alternate
serving
vessel
regardless
this
was
a
nice
little
winter
seasonal
big
belgian
yeast
profile
brwon
sugar
banana
fruity
esters
quite
sweet
not
a
gamechanger
but
quite
drinkable
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
on
this
given
day
o
an
easy
drinking
belgian
dark
that
im
pretty
sure
doesnt
really
fit
the
style
overall
i
liked
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
not
unusual
for
ithaca
beers
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
beer
would
go
well
in
several
situations
with
food
as
a
fairly
sessionable
beer
because
of
the
dryness
or
as
a
final
beer
for
the
night
because
of
the
decent
amount
of
complexity
a
nice
beer
will
recommend
overall
incredibly
filling
rich
fresh
baked
bread
thick
but
not
overpoweringly
alcoholic
or
hoppy
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
got
wasted
and
sick
drinking
too
many
of
years
ago
and
have
unfairly
sworn
off
ever
since
i
revisited
it
yesterday
and
have
to
say
ive
really
been
misssing
out
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
totally
different
from
the
countless
generic
winter
beers
out
there
now
the
pours
is
dark
dark
brown
but
not
thick
or
heavy
looking
light
still
passes
through
and
there
is
a
smallish
off
white
head
around
for
just
a
few
seconds
before
it
flattens
out
the
nose
is
really
odd
smokey
but
not
quite
at
that
rauch
level
there
is
also
belgian
yeast
and
candy
sugar
present
making
this
more
of
a
dubbel
than
an
amber
in
my
book
but
its
more
than
that
there
is
that
life
and
limb
birch
syrup
smell
and
taste
as
well
which
doesnt
come
across
as
very
sweet
here
but
it
adds
a
lot
of
depth
to
the
aroma
and
flavor
its
woody
in
taste
oaky
kind
of
drinks
like
and
old
ale
but
this
is
certainly
a
curious
mishmash
of
styles
complex
malt
profile
on
the
medium
to
heavy
roast
side
but
tempered
by
a
very
vibrant
belgian
yeast
strain
the
alcohol
content
is
just
right
for
these
cold
dark
months
and
the
light
carbonation
combined
with
the
fuller
body
make
this
is
nice
winter
beer
that
sticks
to
your
guts
in
all
the
right
ways
one
of
ithacas
best
seasonals
smoky
almost
like
a
rauch
bier
nice
caramel
color
but
light
than
would
expect
from
the
taste
it
seems
like
it
should
be
darker
very
pleasant
body
not
much
to
report
in
the
way
of
smell
a
good
transition
beer
into
winter
or
a
winterlike
beer
for
those
that
dont
like
winter
beers
looks
nice
smells
nice
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
wont
go
down
as
the
greatest
belgian
amber
ever
but
its
still
coming
off
respectable
could
stand
a
bit
more
tweaking
and
smoothing
around
the
edges
but
it
definitely
works
especially
considering
the
style
and
how
often
its
mediocre
at
best
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
crazy
look
the
nose
and
the
creaminess
to
each
slurp
the
nose
gave
a
rich
and
appropriate
preview
of
what
was
to
come
in
the
nose
while
the
flavoring
subsequently
delivered
on
all
accounts
the
end
actually
became
a
bit
muddled
and
the
sourness
of
grain
took
away
from
the
initial
balanced
and
sweetness
of
the
brew
additionally
the
feel
was
beautiful
at
the
outset
but
the
huge
carbonation
became
overwhelming
at
times
this
is
a
great
beer
but
some
aspects
could
use
some
refinement
its
really
a
great
belgianstyle
beer
although
something
isnt
quite
right
overall
its
like
comparing
a
really
great
generic
cola
to
coke
lots
of
good
belgian
character
but
not
quite
perfect
explodes
out
of
bottle
with
a
5
finger
khaki
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
hazy
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
belgian

nose
and
flavor
is

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
id
buy
that
for
a
dollar
robocop
o
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
somewhat
locals
fruity
wheaty
dark
and
delicious
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
one
finger
head
which
leaves
no
lace
presence
the
aroma
is
of
candied
yeast
a
bubblegum
like
aroma
with
a
nice
dark
fruit
aroma
after
the
taste
has
a
caramel
malt
backbone
there
is
then
a
big
candied
yeast
flavor
again
it
is
a
bubblegum
like
flavor
there
is
also
a
dark
fruit
in
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
overall
it
was
a
solid
brew
it
is
not
best
in
class
but
it
is
a
good
beer
not
as
complex
as
some
im
a
bit
surprised
at
the
abv
i
would
have
guessed
6
tops
overall
this
beer
was
quite
enjoyable
maybe
because
i
really
like
belgians
but
theres
nice
balance
in
this
beer
nothing
too
dominant
but
flavors
assert
themselves
bold
and
balanced
overall
this
cannot
compete
with
belgian
brews
uh
from
belgium
but
this
is
a
very
decent
domestic
version
of
the
style
i
wanted
a
bit
more
of
the
toasty
note
but
that
is
my
only
complaint
to
find
this
quality
in
a
6
is
a
nice
opportunity
of
all
of
us
decent
brew
onot
a
fan
nose
was
a
bit
off
but
still
had
some
of
the
typical
characteristics
but
the
flavor
was
way
off
overall
this
seemed
more
like
a
home
brew
than
something
from
ithaca
ill
admit
that
it
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
in
my
glass
but
it
still
seemed
to
be
a
bit
of
a
mess
its
not
balanced
and
the
taste
is
strange
oanother
solid
beer
from
ithaca
an
interesting
choice
for
a
winter
seasonal
but
good
nonetheless
o
the
beer
hides
any
traces
of
alcohol
very
well
but
would
be
a
lot
more
drinkable
if
it
had
some
malty
sweetness
d
a
less
than
inspiring
belgian
dark
ale
probably
my
least
favorite
ithaca
offering
to
date
not
terrible
but
not
anything
i
would
either
recommend
or
reach
for
in
the
future
if
provided
the
opportunity
picked
this
beer
in
a
make
your
own
six
pack
wegmans
i
consumed
straight
out
of
the
bottle
perhaps
i
would
have
gotten
a
better
sense
of
this
beer
if
i
had
consumed
it
in
a
chalice
or
had
more
than
one
but
overall
it
just
struck
me
as
being
very
weird
like
drinking
yoohoo
from
a
swimming
pool
there
was
a
weird
taste
i
couldnt
describe
my
boyfriend
called
it
floral
which
i
can
understand
coming
from
ithaca
but
to
me
it
was
awkward
like
chlorine
overall
i
think
this
a
solid
winter
offering
from
ithaca
alot
of
nice
belgian
characteristics
in
this
beer
not
too
spicy
like
some
other
winter
offerings
o
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
a
terrible
ale
i
just
think
that
there
is
too
much
going
on
in
my
opinion
the
belgian
style
mixed
with
the
amber
ale
style
doesnt
mix
well
here
i
personally
wouldnt
drink
it
and
even
though
i
got
a
six
pack
ill
probably
give
the
rest
of
the
pack
away
i
dunno
what
in
the
flavor
gives
it
this
flavor
but
it
has
a
slight
resemblance
to
wood
ash
and
i
hate
to
say
it
cigarette
smoke
overall
its
like
raisin
ashcharcoal
this
might
be
the
first
time
i
have
gotten
this
off
flavor
this
isnt
strong
enough
to
kill
the
beer
but
it
brings
it
down
a
bit
notes
dam
tasty
all
over
cheers
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
displays
moderate
retention
and
minimal
lace
smells
of
brown
bread
dark
sugars
licorice
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
esters
taste
is
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
caramel
mixed
with
some
dark
dried
fruits
and
anise
the
yeasty
phenols
are
strong
with
this
one
and
for
me
a
bit
overpowering
i
can
tell
if
im
picking
up
some
spices
in
this
or
if
its
the
earthiness
of
the
hops
deep
in
the
background
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
thick
sweet
sugary
mouthfeel
i
tried
but
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
the
problem
is
the
flavors
are
not
balanced
here
the
beer
is
all
out
of
whack
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
belgian
yeast
dominates
with
hints
of
toasty
fruit
and
vanilla
very
nice
winter
style
from
ithaca
beer
company
and
overall
a
nice
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
crisp
it
finished
super
dry
which
i
was
happy
about
it
did
pick
up
a
slight
medicinal
note
towards
the
absolute
end
of
the
glass
which
was
slightly
offputting
but
other
than
that
i
was
happily
surprised
a
dark
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
solid
light
tannish
colored
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
chocolaty
clove
banana
malt
medley
with
a
vague
swampy
seaweed
element
really
unique
and
very
nice
the
flavor
offers
charcoalsmoked
malt
over
clovey
yeast
orange
peel
hop
and
burnt
coffee
very
different
and
tasty
this
stuff
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
glassy
smooth
feel
but
a
tingly
carbonation
not
bad
at
all
recommended
sampled
on
november
13
2011
it
pours
a
handsome
looking
dark
amber
with
a
nice
silky
tan
head
that
lingers
the
aroma
is
emboldened
with
blended
european
malts
yeast
and
a
freshly
baked
bread
element
the
body
falls
well
into
the
medium
range
but
it
is
kind
of
carbonated
the
taste
begins
powerfully
with
candied
sugar
and
sweet
belgian
malts
at
the
start
followed
by
a
slightly
unexpected
sharp
hopped
bitterness
at
the
tail
end
it
really
catches
the
feel
of
a
good
belgian
influenced
dark
ale
but
it
seemed
just
a
little
off
the
mark
but
it
would
not
stop
me
from
buying
it
again
slightly
sour
with
biting
bitterness
that
comes
from
nondescript
hops
the
alcohol
is
notable
and
warming
the
yeast
shows
up
on
the
tongue
dark
malts
are
present
but
not
strong
body
is
thin
as
is
the
carbonation
level
a
good
if
unspectacular
and
strong
winterwarming
beer
my
wife
and
i
used
to
love
living
5
minutes
from
ithaca
brew
co
although
after
a
year
removed
from
having
cold
front
im
not
as
impressed
as
i
once
was
still
a
solid
beer
a
very
unique
beer
and
one
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
i
couldnt
see
myself
enjoying
this
with
any
regularity
but
it
is
an
interesting
showing
from
a
brewing
that
can
really
pump
out
some
innovative
beers
o
overall
this
drinks
pretty
easy
but
lacks
a
depth
of
character
and
with
a
phenolic
boozy
finish
quite
nice
explore
it
o
i
really
liked
this
one
it
makes
for
a
great
wintertime
sipper
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
solid
beer
way
to
go

you

the
taste
was
mostly
caramel
malts
up
front
light
sugar
and
some
dark
fruits
and
spices
in
there
but
not
very
distinctive
medium
body
and
a
bit
of
film
left
in
the
mouth
decent
and
moderately
drinkable
definitely
a
fine
belgian
ale
worth
trying
and
its
made
in
one
of
my
favorite
towns
of
all
time
they
have
a
great
interpretation
on
the
style
not
too
complex
but
also
keeps
your
senses
quite
active
would
love
to
try
this
baby
on
tap
o
a
great
beer
that
i
am
thankfull
to
have
since
its
not
available
in
my
area
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fall
fridge
if
it
was
available
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
for
a
few
months
now
im
glad
ive
gotten
around
to
finally
reviewing
it
ithaca
is
slowly
becoming
one
of
a
my
new
favorite
breweries
d
not
as
funky
or
outthere
as
some
belgian
style
interpretations
it
does
hit
the
right
notes
and
is
reasonable
complex
but
just
lacks
a
little
in
the
umph
department
i
do
like
how
the
yeast
gives
a
bright
zesty
sort
of
counterseasonal
almost
summery
twang
great
as
fall
or
even
spring
seasonal
this
beer
was
my
favorite
ithaca
so
far
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
damn
tasty
notes
not
impressed
i
think
its
needs
some
retooling
in
the
yeast
department
d
smooth
well
balanced
and
extremely
enjoyable
another
solid
ale
from
ithaca
beer
company
and
should
be
tried
by
anyone
who
enjoys
dubbels
definitely
recommended
pours
a
deep
amber
mahogany
brown
hue
with
a
large
fine
bubbled
tan
khaki

forms
fine
scattered
lacing
aromatics
offer
up
sharp
fruity

layers
intertwined
a
bit
of
floralgrassiness
and

combined
to
form
a
very
pleasant
nose
cherry
earthiness
with
juicy
raisin
a
bit
of
tart
apple
as
well
call
it
a
belgian
amberdubbel
it
fits
the
mold
maybe
its
the
yeast
but
this
is
complex
as
all
hell
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
the
spicy
yeasttart
applesjuicy
raisin
sweetness
with
some
earthyherbal
faint
hops
combines
to
create
pure
bliss
a
really
nice
seasonal
offering
more
beautiful
beer
coming
out
of
ithaca
i
love
these
guys
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
bottle
says
best
by
february
i
say
forever
seven
percent
not
really
hoppy
a
bunch
of
belgian
yeast
packing
its
magic
this
will
lay
down
for
awhile
carbonation
is
effervescent
excellent
use
of
belgian
yeast
really
seems
like
a
quality
american
brewed
version
drinkability
i
will
be
back
classic
example
of
why
ithaca
beers
are
a
go
to
option
pure
quality
expressed
with
every
beer
ive
had
from
them
drinkable
enough
though
id
probably
want
to
let
it
sit
longer
than
my
typical
510
minute
wait
time
if
i
order
this
out
again
overall
i
initially
tried
this
beer
at
the
brewery
in
ithaca
and
remember
being
quite
delighted
in
the
taste
after
the
bartender
described
it
for
us
typically
a
belgianstyle
amber
would
be
too
sweet
and
not
hoppy
enough
for
me
while
the
hops
werent
there
it
wasnt
sweet
at
all
and
actually
was
quite
delightful
a
shame
this
was
only
brewed
once
d
dont
think
i
would
have
any
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
bitterness
without
much
standing
up
to
it
hurts
drinkability
if
you
would
plan
on
having
several
i
recommend
letting
them
all
warm
considerably
before
beginning
d
goes
down
easily
pretty
tasty
not
too
filling
nice
kick
and
nice
representation
of
style
sure
enough
this
was
strong
enough
to
warm
me
up
and
i
could
easily
have
had
another
in
a
sitting
if
it
was
cold
out
as
its
been
here
lately
this
isnt
bitter
and
the
little
amount
of
yeast
is
just
enough
to
perk
this
beer
up
and
make
it
a
nice
mellow
choice
for
dark
early
winter
nights
drinkability
gets
a
hit
due
to
the
powerful
flavors
that
can
overwhelm
over
a
session
nice
initial
pour
with
one
finger
of
head
medium
sized
carb
bubbles
hangs
around
awhile
but
eventually
fades
to
a
thin
film
color
is
between
a
ruddy
brown
and
deep
buckwheat
honey
amber
aroma
is
full
of
banana
and
clove
and
dominated
by
the
belgian
yeast
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
flavors
of
the
yeast
again
banana
and
clove
there
is
a
dark
bready
quality
to
the
body
and
a
nice
bite
from
some
hops
right
at
the
end
md
i
expect
a
little
more
luxuriation
in
bda
but
then
again
i
dont
believe
this
is
bottle
conditioned
at
that
probably
has
something
to
do
with
that
all
in
all
though
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
i
like
it
alot
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tanned
foamy
long
lasting
head
aroma
of
belgium
yeast
bread
some
dark
fruit
and
hints
of
spicy
hops
medium
tangy
and
somewhat
sweet
body
flavor
of
caramel
malt
spicy

and
yeast
long
dry
spicy
finish
very
interesting
brew
came
out
with
nearly
half
head
when
poured
into
a
high
glass
this
amber
ale
smelled
fantastic
very
memorable
the
taste
is
a
sweet
belgian
dark
style
chewy
is
the
best
way
to
describe
it
its
a
craft
brew
for
sure
this
would
scare
your
average
beer
drinker
away
im
more
of
belgian
purist
and
this
is
an
interpretation
of
the
style
more
than
anything
else
worthy
if
you
can
get
it
a
very
nice
seasonal
beer
the
coor
was
excellent
an
almost
perfect
shade
of
amber
somewhere
between
red
and
orange
the
color
was
somewhat
cloudy
there
was
a
taste
of
cinnamon
that
i
did
not
expect
the
smell
was
just
to
die
for
it
was
very
floral
all
in
all
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
and
again
this
time
of
year
because
it
certainly
make
me
feel
warmer
d
its
got
a
warming
quality
to
it
which
is
nice
but
its
also
surprisingly
heavy
so
its
not
really
great
d
this
is
a
good
beer
which
was
enjoyed
but
the
spiciness
becomes
a
bit
tiring
after
awhile
d
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
fresh
ithaca
is
a
great
brewery
and
its
my
own
fault
for
not
waiting
to
find
a
nonexpired
bottle
definitely
send
this
back
if
its
past
the
freshness
date
deep
dark
brown
with
beautiful
white
head
and
lacing
faint
nose
of
hops
with
a
mild
belgian
yeast
thing
going
on
tastes
somewhat
strong
but
with
some
nice
fruity
stuff
happening
to
bring
it
full
circlevery
nice
medium
mouth
but
good
carbonation
a
lot
going
on
here
great
change
of
pace
brew
and
the
name
spells
it
out
perfectlythis
is
the
second
year
ill
be
enjoying
this
one
through
the
winter
glad
to
have
come
acrooss
this
one
notes
a
good
way
to
bring
in
the
fall
its
not
perfect
but
it
warms
you
up
nicely
while
not
filling
you
up
in
the
process
the
taste
is
hard
to
swallow
literally
some
malty
dark
fruits
but
the
yeast
flavor
is
extremely
overpowering
and
the
bananacloviness
is
so
prolific
and
onedimensional
it
makes
the
mouthfell
suffer
as
well
i
do
not
think
the
dark
farmhouse
worked
out
as
well
as
the
brewer
hoped
really
hit
or
miss
so
far
for
me
on
the
ithaca
collection
o
an
interesting
beer
good
flavors
complexity
interesting
mouthfeel
i
like
it
another
good
offering
from
ibc
and
continuing
their
foray
into
belgian
offerings
fairly
aggressive
pour
yields
a
medium
brown
ale
with
some
amber
tints
to
it
a
healthy
2
fingers
of
tan
head
and
light
lacing
lots
of
belgian
yeast
and
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
in
the
nose
the
taste
seems
to
follow
right
along
with
the
smell
dark
fruits
prunes
raisins
purple
plums
a
nice
yeastiness
if
thats
even
a
word
also
some
sweetness
caramel
toffee
and
spice
a
nice
flavor
profile
i
get
alot
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
and
its
dry
i
didnt
have
huge
expectations
going
into
this
tasting
and
it
pretty
much
lived
up
to
that
an
overall
decent
belgian
ale
the
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
but
ok
for
the
style
at
least
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
syrupy
tastes
and
sticky
finish
and
drinks
a
little
warm
for
only
7
2
its
a
definite
winter
or
late
fall
cold
day
to
sip
perhaps
by
a
fire
or
while
cuddling
with
a
loved
one
drinkability
decent
tasting
but
alittle
past
its
prime
whats
there
is
nice
however
and
if
this
is
in
your
cellar
it
may
be
time
to
consume
perhaps
this
would
be
more
enjoyable
when
its
cool
out
versus
this
heat
were
dealing
w
now
nonetheless
this
is
a
pretty
unique
brew
d
a
bit
of
a
citric
aftertaste
and
i
could
stand
the
finish
being
a
little
less
sour
however
overall
this
beer
was
way
more
than
i
had
expected
definitely
will
be
buying
this
again
overall
a
very
good
beer
the
presentation
is
great
each
sip
has
left
a
ring
around
the
glass
cold
front
has
some
pleasantries
early
on
but
the
beer
becomes
messy
once
the
lack
of
malt
flavor
and
body
becomes
evident
its
kinda
like
having
all
the
best
christmas
ornaments
but
the
tree
is
in
shambles
ithaca
beer
company
has
given
us
some
amazing
ales
ten
and
old
habit
come
to
mind
cold
front
didnt
leave
me
chilly
but
i
never
did
really
warm
up
to
it
either
thanks
to
jwc215
for
the
bottle
notes
overall
not
a
real
stand
out
but
it
can
hold
its
own
and
it
is
very
drinkable
d
nice
beer
fun
to
try
slow
drinker
for
me
good
winter
brew
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
doesnt
really
match
the
style
the
brewers
chose
for
it
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
d
another
good
brew
from
ithaca
brewery
the
dark
flavors
provide
a
good
brew
for
the
colder
seasons
i
really
recommend
this
for
someone
who
wants
a
filling
flavorful
craft
brew
for
the
cold
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
big
fluffy
threefinger
tan
head
the
smell
is
very
belgian
with
some
of
the
characteristic
yeastiness
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
and
spiciness
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
breadiness
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
middle
and
some
spiciness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
satisfying
thick
with
some
fine
carbonation
this
beer
is
probably
my
favorite
from
ithaca
if
i
didnt
know
better
you
could
probably
convince
me
its
actually
from
belgium
d
very
nice
example
of
an
american
belgian
ale
lots
of
belgian
character
pretty
authentic
overall
there
are
definitely
better
ones
out
there
but
this
does
a
pretty
good
job
at
the
style
probably
wont
get
to
revisit
this
one
but
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
give
it
a
try
d
the
ithaca
website
calls
this
a
belgianstyle
amber
ale
and
the
ba
website
is
calling
it
a
belgian
dark
ale
whatever
this
beer
is
its
certainly
not
a
bsda
which
is
what
the
pub
menu
led
me
to
believe
and
possibly
why
the
cold
front
received
mostly
average
ratings
or
maybe
it
was
on
the
merits
of
the
beer
alone
nonetheless
this
one
needs
some
help
or
heart
or
tweaking
or
something
off
tap
at
the
brewery
this
beer
was
a
dark
garnetcopper
color
with
two
fingers
of
khakicolored
head
the
aroma
was
spicy
with
hints
of
fruit
wild
yeast
and
sandalwood
the
flavors
were
odd
a
combination
of
earthy
malt
first
then
followed
by
a
sourness
in
the
middle
coupled
with
the
tart
notes
of
bretlike
yeast
hints
of
roasted
malt
appeared
as
it
warmed
up
along
with
more
esters
and
caramel
malt
the
mouthfeel
body
and
carbonation
were
all
average
a
belgian
dark
ale
i
wasnt
exactly
sold
very
authentic
tasting
rich
and
belgian
tasting
dark
and
kind
of
woody
this
is
how
it
should
be
at

its
a
great
sipper
over
the
course
of
an
evening
as
a
saison
but
not
as
much
as
would
be
the
case
with
just
pale

the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
idea
i
like
the
taste
this
pours
a
dark
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
caramel
malts
molasses
and
sugars
the
taste
is
sweet
and
smooth
which
is
very
uncharacteristic
of
an
abbey
tripel
as
it
drinks
and
tastes
more
like
a
thin
stout
this
very
unusual
taste
will
probably
turn
you
off
if
you
are
tripel
drinker
i
want
these
brewers
to
survive
though
they
are
near
my
stomping
grounds
d
viking
seems
to
be
on
the
brink
of
greatness
but
there
is
just
something
missing
with
some
of
the
beers
i
have
had
if
they
can
improve
the
maltcaramel
characteristics
in
this
beer
so
it
is
better
balanced
with
the
sour
apple
taste
i
think
they
will
have
a
solid
beer
until
then
i
cant
see
myself
having
too
much
of
this
dont
get
me
wrong
forgetting
its
labeling
its
a
rather
nice
beer
of
indeterminate
variety
and
is
decently
drinkable
i
had
hoped
for
more
i
havent
had
enough
viking
beer
to
know
if
there
is
a
huge
amount
of
batchtobatch
variation
or
if
some
of
their
offerings
are
simply
less
than
good
on
a
regular
basis
if
this
bottle
is
at
all
representative
abby
abnormal
is
not
a
beer
that
i
have
any
desire
to
drink
again
the
drinkability
is
ok
as
well
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
prosit
mk
overall
i
really
liked
this
brew
and
will
deffinatly
try
it
again
i
was
very
disappointed
a
much
darker
beer
than
i
anticipated
pouring
a
mediumbrown
hue
with
ample
carbonation
along
with
a
caramelly
fruity
aroma
very
smooth
and
rather
tart
the
bottle
says
abbey
but
this
is
drinking
a
little
bit
more
like
a
sour
brown
ale
im
not
complaining
a
very
refreshing
brew
that
is
very
drinkable
the
fine
bead
of
carbonation
forms
a
tight
ring
of
bubbles
enhancing
the
appearance
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
of
rown
sugar
allspice
and
a
hint
cinnamon
surface
in
the
aroma
this
beer
has
some
very
tasty
fruity
flavors
think
tamarind
the
finish
is
a
bit
tart
and
delicately
hopped
for
balance
a
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
belgianstyle
beer
decent
brew
may
have
been
too
fresh
ill
try
cellaring
this
one
to
see
just
how
it
sorts
itself
out
ill
review
it
again
at
that
point
and
decide
whether
or
not
to
buy
it
again

dark
brown
and
clear
like
coffee
with
some
plumb
highlights
the
head
consists
of
thin
wisps
of
white
bubbles
smells
predominantly
of
pomegranate
with
some
hints
of
dry
and
sour
coffee
and
a
honey
sweetness
the
flavor
begins
with
a
tough
lemon
and
unripe
nectarine
sourness
especially
around
the
edges
of
my
tongue
and
then
reveals
a
coffee
and
molasses
smoky
malt
it
then
fades
back
into
citrus
rind
and
pomegranate
sourness
and
finishes
with
a
smooth
oat
and
coffee
interesting
flavors
and
fantastic
dynamics
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
heavy
body
with
a
light
carbonation
good
body
fun
to
drink
not
very
familiar
with
this
style
after
this
will
go
looking
for
more
i
will
admit
i
am
a
little
nervous
about
this
beer
a
viking
belgian
ale
hmm
pours
out
a
dark
brown
cola
pretty
much
no
head
smell
is
dark
roasted
malts
and
brown
sugar
and
molasses
taste
is
dark
and
fruity
slight
coffee
and
more
molasses
carmel
and
toffee
a
very
sweet
dark
beer
that
is
unique
if
nothing
else
mouthfeel
is
flat
like
most
of
the
viking
beers
not
the
best
but
unique
i
gotta
say
i
would
have
this
one
again
i
dont
know
if
the
viking
beers
are
hit
and
miss
but
this
time
around
this
one
was
a
hit
a
nice
enough
beer
yummy
as
it
goes
but
falls
a
few
shades
short
of
where
its
trying
to
go
id
say
that
some
age
might
blend
the
tastes
together
but
some
of
these
tastes
i
dont
want
in
here
i
dont
know
enough
to
know
whether
or
not
the
metallic
bitterness
will
leave
in
time
but
it
gets
in
the
way
of
my
interest
in
buying
more
to
age
mouthfeel
is
clean
refreshing
and
is
medium
in
body
this
brew
is
very
unique
and
tastes
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
i
wasnt
too
sure
about
it
at
first
but
its
definately
got
something
there
worth
drinking
hazy
brown
color
with
a
purplish
cast
to
the
appearance
flattish
head
tan
average
staying
power
a
little
dissappointing
laces
thinly
but
with
some
pattern
aroma
is
strikingly
yeasty
almost
compost
in
earthiness
undercarbonated
and
flattish
mouthfeel
needs
more
here
the
flavor
is
interesting
starts
cocoa
mulch
and
somewhat
uninteresting
but
by
mid
mouth
it
gains
a
lot
prunes
currants
damp
top
soil
and
wet
canvas
the
bittering
is
truly
close
to
an
acrid
spring
aroma
on
the
farm
really
different
kind
of
interesting
but
i
have
to
feel
that
this
one
is
more
heavyhanded
in
approach
disinctive
yeast
than
expertly
executed
an
ok
beer
really
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
i
think
i
am
torn
between
wanting
to
give
it
a
bit
better
numbers
but
it
doesnt
impress
me
enough
even
though
the
subtlities
were
nice
i
need
a
bit
more
out
of
it
i
kept
hoping
it
was
going
to
improve
as
i
got
through
the
bomber
but
it
primarily
stays
the
same
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
not
bad
and
its
not
excellent
either
it
does
however
promise
subtlity
and
tries
to
keep
you
interested
but
in
the
end
its
time
for
something
else
for
the
style
i
expected
more
and
unlike
the
previous
reviewer
of
this
beer
i
was
not
left
wanting
more
after
finishing
off
the
22oz
bomber
hard
to
rate
this
is
a
very
bizarre
beer
that
i
absolutely
hated
initially
accepted
by
midglass
and
needed
more
of
by
the
time
the
bomber
emptied
750
ml

into

oh
wow
an
amazing
good
winter
beer
like
a
combination
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
and
an
american
spiced
winter
warmer
dangerously
drinkable
this
one
tempted
me
into
another
one
rather
than
trying
yet
another
beer
from
the
wider
la
trappe
menu
a
great
winter
beer
this
is
far
from
the
greatest
beer
ive
had
but
its
enjoyable
enough
to
finish
of
the
750ml
i
dont
know
as
that
id
pay
the
full
7
99
price
for
it
but
the
sale
price
of
3
99
is
more
enticing
it
does
become
a
bit
strange
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
though
jd
poured
into
a
gulden

filling
half
the

mild
aroma
of
sweet

spices
with
a
slightly
mineral
component
flavor
is
a
light
sweet
and
caramel
malt
and
light
fruit
dominated
by
apple
a
slight
buttery
diacetyl
flavor
finish
is
somewhat
dry
and
spicy
although
the
spices
are
nondescript
light
to
medium
bodied
which
is
surprising
considering
the
healthy
head
on
this
ale
not
very
assertive
flavors
but
pleasant
to
drink
a
nice
but
not
outstanding
winter
belgian
pours
a
dark
brown
not
so
clear
pillowy
off
white
froth
aromas
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
pumpernickel
bread
and
alittle
floral
in
the
taste
a
nice
brown

with
more
bready
character
small
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice

out
the

profile
some
mineral
aspects
tiny
bit
tart

creamy
overall
not
a
bad
winter
offering
lots
of
spices
but
short
of
noteworthy
o
not
my
favorite
of
belgians
but
still
a
beer
that
is
good
in
the
winter
slightly
warming
feel
worthy
of
a
try

reddish

o
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
beer
another
very
good
offering
from

o
this
is
an
interesting
ale
but
could
display
better
balance
i
like
it
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
pours
a
light
bronzed
orange
with
noticeable
carbonation

dissipates
to

malty

fruitcake
sweet

light

a

nice
but
i
wouldnt
go
out

my
way
to
drink
it
again
poured
from
a
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
into
a
fancy
belgian
glass
that
came
with
it
hazy
amber
with
blonde
highlights
around
the
edges
when
backlit
and
a
big
fizzy
khaki
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
sugar
cookie
and
dark
fruit
with
some
mild
belgian
yeast
funkiness
delicious
holiday
spice
and
raisin
with
tart
green
apple
and
rye
breadiness
after
several
minutes
of
warming
and
adding
the
last
of
the
bottle
to
the
glass
ive
bumped
the
flavor
score
a
little
higher
a
little
more
flavor
concentration
would
really
make
this
one
special
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
a
fine
ale
but
not
one
of
the
truly
great
examples
of
the
style
atmosphere
is
good
appearance
is
pretty
decent
nice
color
and
a
good
solid
foamy
head
nose
is
a
nice
woody
grain
with
a
hint
of
sweet
nice
balance
has
a
very
woody
flavor
profile
and
strong
alcohol
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
d
the
beer
isnt
difficult
to
drink
but
would
be
a
little
more
palatable
if
it
had
a
bigger
body
and
lacked
the
metallic
smell
and
taste
notes
decent
winter
brew
but
i
wasnt
getting
as
much
bsda
flavors
as
i
hoped
tart
fruit
and
cooking
spice
dominates
with
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
heat
nice
in
small
doses
for
a
winter
night
but
not
something
i
necessarily
crave
all
in
all
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
higher
carbonation
but
still
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
a
very
dark
beer
a
nice
little
head
with
a
top
on
the
beer
which
disappears
fast
sweet
and
sour
battle
with
each
other
tasty
beer
for
christmas
quite
good
certainly
not
what
i
expected
from
a
winter
ale
pours
a
fivefinger
offwhite
pillowy
head
that
takes
forever
to
fade
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color
despite
a
ton
of
yeast
left
in
bottle
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
apple
and
malt
nose
flavor
is
sour
apple
and
yeast
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
winter
ale
but
not
bad
pricey
at
18
00
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
a
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
all
in
all
not
my
fav
but
i
would
try
again
forsher
on
the
dark
side
for
this
style
with
a
root
beer
brown
color
huge
billowing
off
white
head
smells
wonderful
apple
cider
dark
fruits
pepper
and
alcohol
smells
tastes
of
sour
apple
cider
too
fizzy
for
my
liking
a
sourtart
beer
worth
trying
a
good
session
winter
beer
i
have
to
score
this
one
pretty
high
on
drinkability
although
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
in
this
belgian
dark
ale
style
bsda
yes
bda
no
this
is
ok
i
didnt
expect
much
out
of
a
5
beer
including
glass
it
is
brewed
by
bavik
and
isnt
all
that
bad
it
is
definitely
a
belgian
ale
it
is
slightly
watery
but
decent
flavored
this
is
a
great
beer
that
paired
well
with
jamaican
beef
brisket
fontinagarganzola
cheese
veggie
pizza
and
spicy
rum
black
beans
petrus
winter
ale
pours
a
stiff
couple

of

over
a

carbonation
is
steady
and
moderate
and
the
nose
is
grain

a
little
yeast
funk
and
a
tang
of

flavor
is
mild
wheat
cracker
up
front
with
notes
of
dried
fruit
giving
over
to
a
likewise
restrained
herbal
hop
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
fairly
light
finishing
semi
dry
very
light
and
crisp
for
a
holiday
offering
it
makes
a
nice
change
from
the
heavier
fare
that
often
characterizes
the
winter
warmerholiday
ale
style
well
worth
a
try
and
the
goblet
is
just
fabulous
d
this
was
an
ok
beer
there
seemed
to
be
too
many
flavors
that
just
didnt
meld
together
properly
sort
of
a
disappointment
from
petrus
especially
considering
that
its
meant
to
be
a
winterholiday
ale
hmm
pretty
nice
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
off

head
with
lots
of

is
dirty
copperish
amber
aroma
is
funky
nice
with
some

sour
skanky
belly
button
old
cheese
and
something
else
i
cant
stick
my
nose
in
flavors
all
a
that
and
more
this
one
is
slightly
more
sour
than
sweet
which
makes
it
so
drinkable
some
caramel
body
is
good
although
carbonation
seems
a
tad
strong
good
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
very
lively
carbonation
fits
well
i
think
with
this
style
light
bodied
if
this
was
a
bit
cheaper
id
pick
it
up
more
lacks
depth
and
character
not
really
the
best
example
of
a
belgian
winter
warmer
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
cellared
from
2007
into
a
tulip
glass
hazy
amberbrown
with
a
very
large
fluffy
offwhite
head
smells
like
green
apples
and
yeast
taste
is
primarily
tart
apples
followed
by
some
malty
sweetness
finishing
with
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
yeast
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
the
tartness
makes
the
mouth
water
after
every
sip
very
smooth
and
drinkable
delicious
d
this
is
extremely
drinkable
for
a
dark
belgian
ale
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
abv
over
6
for
me
though
this
is
simply
too
lacking
in
flavor
to
consider
it
a
top
notch
belgian
brew
lively
belgian
with
a
pleasant
profile
this
beer
pours
a
muted
amberbrown
with
a
puffy
frothy
head
theres
some
haze
as
i
get
closer
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
its
just
from
the
yeast
cake
being
disturbed
a
bit
the
aroma
has
a
phenol
bandaid
quality
with
touches
of
sweet
cherries
spices
and
lightly
caramelized
sugar
the
flavor
is
more
successful
dry
and
lightly
sour
from
a
pleasant
belgian
yeast
the
beer
is
nice
and
light
on
the
palate
there
just
isnt
enough
going
on
for
a
higher
score
i
assume
that
they
call
it
a
winter
beer
so
youll
keep
drinking
it
after
christmas
thin
brown
with
scant
tan
head
thinner
and
plainer
than
most
christmas
ales
although
i
did
like
the
cinnamon
aroma
little
bitterness
and
not
enough
complexity
drinkability
decent
once
again
its
like
drinking
an
apple
juice
beer
or
something
not
bad
just
not
my
thing
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
nice
little
bda
a
bit
light
for
a
noel
and
i
can
see
how
the
soap
notes
might
be
too
much
for
people
id
be
curious
to
know
if
they
were
stronger
or
less
so
when
it
was
first
bottled
probably
about
1
5
years
ago
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
although
not
the
best
belgian
dark
i
have
sampled
quite
enjoyable
not
what
i
was
expecting
based
on
it
being
a
belgian
darkwinter
ale
style
brew
but
respectable
in
its
own
way
md
despite
the
fizzy
outlook
the
mouthfeel
comes
much
milder
and
retains
a
refreshing
level
at
best
all
in
all
this
mediumbodied
amber
ale
is
perhaps
the
lightest
and
least
complex
ive
come
across
for
a
belgian
winter
ale
and
remarkably
so
imo
as
a
quaffable

in

i
enjoyed
this
one
if
you
appreciate
the
variety
and
eccentricity
of
belgian
brewing
this
one
is
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
especially
after
swirling
some
of
the
carbonation
out
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
pretty
nice
d
im
still
conflicted
whether
this
was
meant
to
be
a
sour
beer
that
said
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
a
sour
beer
i
found
the
chocolate
malts
to
be
odd
in
said
sour
beer
however
this
turned
into
a
great
introduction
to
sour
beers
for
my
roommate
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
my
bottle
was
from
the
20072008
winter
i
wonder
if
a
20082009
winter
ale
is
sour
as
well
or
if
this
is
something
that
has
developed
more
throughout
the
cellaring
i
bought
this
at
roof
brothers
liquors
in
paducah
ky
kane
says
its
a
red
ale
but
i
dont
know
notes
my
first
of
the
petrus
beers
i
bought
almost
all
of
them
at
beers
of
the
world
in
rochester
before
finding
this
winter
ale
here
in
cleveland
i
have
yet
to
sample
those
other
ones
but
this
may
be
the
best
winter
ale
that
i
have
had
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
the
bda
pours
a
clear
honey
brown
color
with
an
airy
egg
shell
colored
head
that
settled
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
light
some
vinous
attributes
sweet
overall
the
taste
is
sweet
toasted
malt
similar
to
an
amber
ale
has
a
lemony
tartness
and
a
subtle
earthy
spice
the
feel
is
fairly
light
tons
of
carbonation
finishes
tart
and
sweet
a
medicore
bda
no
outstanding
flavors
a
tad
overcarbonated
basically
bought
it
for
the
glass
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
carbonation
goes
down
easily
a
sippable
beer
d
easy
drinker
especially
on
a
colder
day
this
could
go
down
very
easily
the
beer
pours
with
a
very
froathy
strongly
efforvescent
appearance
of
amber
rust
and
brown
colored
haze
firm
but
light
aromas
of
apples
with
a
white
grape
vineous
zinfindale
quality
a
follow
up
of
confectionate
maltiness
lightlytart
berries
and
a
mild
fruitcake
scent
permiates
the
winelike
qualities
flavors
closely
mimic
the
aromas
while
placing
emphasis
on
the
malt
sweetness
and
body
and
the
yeasty
spiciness
the
berrylike
attributes
shine
more
and
more
as
the
beer
warms
the
beer
is
soft
and
nearly
evaporates
as
it
hits
the
mouth
the
carbonation
lifts
the
beer
without
any
bite
or
astringency
acidic
throughout
which
leads
to
a
clean
refreshing
spicy
finish
this
beer
is
more
akin
to
belgian
ambers
with
little
hint
of
it
being
more
wintery
than
any
other
beer
still
quite
nice
and
palatable
d
very
drinkable
nothing
really
off
putting
just
not
really
on
target
medium
full
body
effervescence
slightly
crisp
with
a
mildly
dry
finish
a
good
but
weird
brew
very
disconnected
throughout
drinkability
decent
a
three
finger
rocky
tan
head
almost
jumps
out
of
the
glass
body
is
a
rich
murky
dark
brown
nose
is
huge
invigorating
and
very
complex
you
get
notes
of
spicey
biscuits
creamy
vanilla
honey
and
raw
sweet
dough
with
a
hint
of
pepper
a
unique
mix
of
soured
tartfruity
feel
and
pepery
doughy
spice
enters
the
mouth
on
first
sip
there
is
a
nice
crispness
that
resembles
a
green
apple
and
a
powdery
spice
feel
that
is
even
and
long
lasting
on
the
end
of
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
realatively
clean
but
does
have
a
bit
of
thickness
drinkability
is
solid
i
am
a
sucker
for
santa
claus
so
i
picked
up
a
few
bottle
of
petrus
winterbier
when
i
saw
the
jolly
old
guy
on
a
sled
on
the
label
nothing
remarkable
or
bad
about
the
head
or
appearance
just
kind
was
wait
i
take
that
back
there
was
a
lot
of
carbonation
it
smelled
of
sweet
vingar
and
not
too
much
else
not
surprisingly
the
taste
of
vingar
was
apparent
and
i
was
sort
of
stuck
on
that
it
was
also
quite
thin
and
watery
i
kept
sipping
hoping
to
enjoy
the
next
sip
a
little
more
but
i
really
didnt
despite
the
carbonation
it
left
me
flat
it
was
not
aweful
but
just
not
as
satisfying
as
i
would
have
hoped
overflowed
bottle
immediately
upon
opening
poured
into
glass
a
hazy
golden
brown
with
thin
white
head
that
lingered
a
while
more
than
covering
surface
in
a
trappist
glass
alcoholic
spicy
honey
aroma
mild
flavors
of
nutmeg
and
a
pleasing
mellow
tartness
lightly
bready
yeast
also
present
astringent
but
not
outrageously
so
lingering
thin
bitterness
a
rather
bland
belgian
dark
ale
that
is
not
so
wintery
except
maybe
for
some
warming
alcohol
that
creeps
up
drinkability
is
soso
i
think
one
would
do
me
good
on
these
guys
i
think
it
is
an
alright
belgium
dark
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
not
even
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
i
wouldnt
go
and
search
it
down
but
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
i
would
drink
it
again
the
glass
that
came
in
the
box
is
pretty
cool
though
pours
a
slightly
clouded
amber
with
some
head
nose
is
malty
and
at
first
i
thought
i
got
a
whiff
of
something
like
burnt
toast
basically
this
one
has
the
aroma
of
a
strong
and
very
sweet
belgian
flavor
is
strong
with
a
syrupy
sweetness
borders
on
too
much
though
the
following
sips
seem
to
be
more
tolerable
caramel
tone
is
heavy
as
well
feel
is
slightly
syrupy
though
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
a
bit
above
the
average
very
drinkable
as
it
is
smoother
as
you
go
on
i
could
easily
go
for
a
few
of
these
if
i
was
sitting
and
relaxing
in
the
cold
winter
fairly
drinkable
depending
on
your
tolerance
for
citrus
flavor
i
may
buy
this
again
due
to
its
relatively
cheap
4
for
11
2oz
price
as
a
belgian
but
wont
rush
myself
to
do
so
petrus
winter
pours
a
brownruby
color
with
a
persistent
head
be
aware
of
the
cork
and
the
fizz
when
opening
i
almost
broke
the
light
fixture
on
my
ceiling
and
soaked
my
carpet
the
first
time
i
opened
one
of
these
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
intense
carbonation
not
too
common
in
belgian
winters
after
recooping
from
the
first
sip
i
took
a
second
fizzy
at
first
then
flemish
sour
red
ale
flavors
start
to
dominatebut
without
the
strong
sour
taste
this
was
a
nice
experience
to
smell
and
taste
the
vinous
flavors
without
puckering
my
lips
on
the
first
ten
drinks
and
with
carbonation
which
is
almost
non
existent
in
alot
of
flemish
reds
the
finish
is
slightly
hoppy
not
a
great
winter
warming
effect
but
a
great
afternoon
refresher
relatively
speaking
interesting
to
say
the
least
not
what
i
expected
from
a
belgian
winter
but
still
quite
good
beware
the
cork
it
is
a
missile
d
a
good
drinkable
winter
beer
from
petrusbavik
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
when
i
can
find
it
a
solid
brew
drinkability
where
to
begin
there
is
something
very
nice
about
this
beer
that
i
really
want
to
like
drawing
on
some
of
the
better
elements
of
other
petrus
beers
however
the
foamy
tendencies
as
well
as
the
understated
flavor
profile
dilute
the
beers
potential
this
could
be
extraordinary
if
the
flaws
were
removed
this
is
the
first
ive
seen
this
beer
in
ohio
since
they
had
a
thing
about
santa
claus
on
beer
bottles
especially
if
they
are
holding
a
beer
like
this
one
this
beer
poured
a
medium
light
clear
amber
color
and
formed
a
very
foamy
off
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
probably
why
the
cork
exploded
off
the
aroma
is
of
candy
cherries
and
lightly
of
malt
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
of
malt
chocolate
and
cherries
the
body
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
sweet
yet
tart
i
didnt
find
it
as
sour
as
some
others
but
this
may
be
due
to
this
years
vintage
or
my
natural
toleranceaffinity
for
sour
candy
finish
is
sweet
and
sour
d
a
nice
beer
sourness
was
a
surprise
6
5
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
i
wonder
what
effect
the
aging
had
may
have
contributed
to
sourness
certainly
worth
a
try
but
not
outstanding
tastemouthfeel
fruity
at
first
making
me
think
of
sour
green
apples
or
lemons
its
on
the
dry
side
and
a
bit
milder
than
i
was
expecting
its
not
terribly
heavy
and
the
finish
is
brief
and
pretty
clean
making
it
very
drinkable
this
is
a
pleasant
winter
beer
nothing
exceptional
perhaps
but
nice
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
very
nice
beer
a
bit
more
flavor
would
be
nice
but
otherwise
no
complaints
i
am
a
major
petrus
brune
fan
and
buy
it
whenever
i
can
so
this
was
a
colossal
disappointment
still
i
will
have
to
give
this
a
second
chance
somtime
down
the
road
an
ok
beer
in
the
drinkability
department
but
it
probably
is
far
better
in
winter
when
experienced
with
a
sweet
spiced
holiday
treat
like
a
german
christmas
cookie
i
will
try
this
again
sometime
last
swigs
a
basic
brown
belgie
but
no
flaws
just
a
tad
basic
the
malts
are
doughy
but
not
very
sweet
there
is
a
sour
lactic
flavor
with
some
hints
of
butterscotch
overall
the
flavor
intensity
is
pretty
light
as
is
the
mouthfeel
most
of
the
flavors
were
kind
of
scattered
until
it
warmed
and
they
melded
and
improved
but
this
is
not
up
to
what
petrus
usually
does
maybe
i
shouldnt
buy
a
winter
ale
at
a
reduced
price
in
april
not
satisfaying
afterthoughts
just
swirled
in
all
of
the
yeasty
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
what
a
difference
the
smell
smoothed
out
nicely
the
taste
produced
light
notes
of
cinnamon
with
the
yeast
being
supressed
strangely
the
mouthfeel
took
a
chill
and
the
overall
drinkability
was
improved
scores
reflect
an
extra
half
point
added
in
all
areas
just
mentioned
overall
not
a
bad
beer
strong
yeasty
taste
in
the
nose
after
a
tall
head
in
a
tulip
glass
looked
good
in
the
glass
over
a
burnt
caramel
base
with
red
highlights
just
not
that
complex
in
the
taste
plenty
of
spice
and
light
fruit
but
not
much
overall
disappointing
for
the
name
petrus
on
the
label
compared
to
others
of
the
brewery
ok
not
great
pours
a
cloudy
orangebrown
with
a
huge
head
of
off
white
bubbles
very
carbonated
a
tinge
of
sourness
in
the
aroma
at
first
but
it
quickly
faded
into
a
musty
wood
smell
only
a
hint
of
sweetness
well
in
the
background
taste
is
of
fermenting
peaches
eaten
with
a
wooden
spoon
not
that
i
have
done
that
aftertaste
is
mildly
sweet
then
fades
into
a
nice
earthy
hop
bitterness
more
odd
interesting
than
good
interesting
improves
as
it
warms
dont
drink
this
too
cold
or
you
will
be
very
disappointed
if
you
are
looking
for
a
belgian
strong
dark
pass
on
this
one
as
a
holiday
beer
it
is
ok
alas
served
in
a
snifter
this
beer
was
a
hazy
amber
peach
colour
with
a
thin
offwhite
cap
the
fine
bubbles
produced
plenty
of
lace
fruity
aroma
with
notes
of
ripe
peach
and
tropical
fruit
plus
a
tart
earthy
quality
the
flavour
was
fairly
complex
solid
sweetness
that
was
quite
fruity
some
tartness
mild
caramel
and
vanilla
and
oak
there
was
some
tobacco
and
spice
in
the
finish
and
a
lingering
woodiness
with
tart
cherries
so
dry
it
made
my
mouth
water
carbonation
was
lively
and
the
body
was
middle
of
the
road
nice
stuff
and
a
great
finish
to
brunch
along
with
some
dessert
while
not
the
best
of
the
petrus
stable
its
a
solid
offering
which
should
not
be
turned
down
drinkability
disappointing
for
the
style
not
a
very
good
winter
offering
pours
a
murky
amberish
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
tart
with
bubblegum
and
citrus
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
prickly
from
the
high
level
of
carbonation
in
what
may
be
too
much
carbonation
the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
slightly
tart
with
a
very
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
my
really
only
gripe
with
is
lack
of
character
it
is
a
solid
brew
but
lacks
the
character
and
depth
that
would
make
me
want
to
come
back
to
it
in
the
future
d
really
didnt
like
this
one
much
not
alot
of
attractive
qualities
go
along
with
the
flavor
pass
in
the
future
medium
mouth
that
seems
to
have
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
when
combined
with
the
flavors
certainly
drinkable
and
the
right
food
pairing
might
help
this
beer
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
comes
across
as
a
bit
dry
so
i
think
that
it
has
a
bit
of
age
on
it
it
is
still
good
but
it
would
be
a
bit
better
to
try
a
fresher
example
it
is
not
overly
spicy
like
a
lot
of
winter
beers
are
so
i
like
that
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
im
not
sure
how
christmasy
this
is
but
it
is
an
interesting
belgium
dark
ale
i
started
drinking
the
beer
when
it
was
very
cold
and
it
wasnt
very
good
however
i
was
outside
on
a
hot
day
drinking
it
as
the
temperature
of
the
beer
rose
the
taste
became
much
better
the
beer
was
dark
in
color
and
very
drinkable
i
would
get
this
beer
again
notes
ive
enjoyed
beers
from
this
brewery
although
they
havent
blown
my
mind
with
anything
its
usually
solid
and
interesting
the
only
major
drawback
on
this
obviously
is
i
got
some
metallic
and
it
got
worse
as
it
warmed
up
other
than
that
it
was
above
average
the
smell
is
a
poor
mix
of
spice
and
caramel
the
taste
has
more
of
the
caramel
and
malt
flavor
and
less
of
the
spice
some
yeast
funk
is
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
too
light
drinkability
suffers
with
the
flavor
medium
plus
in
body
with
a
touch
of
alcoholic
punch
make
this
brew
a
fairly
easy
drinker
ok
mouthfeel
but
not
that
impressive
for
a
belgian
winter
offering
worth
a
try
cheers
i
spent
1
99
on
the
sixpack
and
really
the
only
thing
worth
the
money
was
the
wooden
bottle
opener
that
came
with
it
cloudy
orange
with
some
head
and
significant
lace
yeast
and
alcohol
in
aroma
not
too
much
there
taste
is
yeast
rather
plain
belgium
a
bit
astringent
and
alcohol
in
mouthfeel
mild
spice
finishable
and
moderately
satisfying
drying
aftertaste
medium
mouthfeel
very
carbonated
foamed
up
some
in
the
bottle
and
has
a
large
head
but
as
it
dissipates
it
leaves
a
little
lace
and
is
very
rocky
and
longlasting
too
the
color
is
kind
of
pale
copper
the
aroma
is
a
bit
odd
i
get
a
faint
cheesy
smell
a
llittle
bit
of
perfumey
esters
but
it
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
and
i
dont
pick
up
a
lot
of
malt
either
maybe
a
hint
the
flavor
is
good
though
with
sweet
maltiness
dominating
kind
of
light
on
body
and
a
little
spritzy
still
some
light
fruitiness
and
a
definite
alcohol
warmth
to
the
beer
not
overwhelming
but
solid
poured
a
dark
cloudy
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
didnt
move
an
inch
for
several
minutes
leaving
behind
rings
of
lace
a
16inch
head
remained
throughout
the
session
aromas
of
caramel
hops
and
grass
were
apparent
to
me
the
hops
were
right
upfront
with
a
sweet
fruity
finish
that
left
my
mouth
dry
and
sticky
a
bit
strong
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
breadlike
texture
that
really
reduced
its
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
but
there
are
areas
for
improvement
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
pretty
smooth
and
dry
the
head
on
this
thing
was
crazy
big
it
started
foaming
the
instant
it
hit
the
glass
it
kind
of
got
a
little
annoying
but
it
looked
so
pretty
the
smell
wasnt
very
strong
so
you
really
had
to
strain
to
smell
anything
what
i
got
was
some
spices
mixed
with
fruit
and
alcohol
the
taste
wasnt
too
bad
though
i
got
tastes
of
spices
up
front
with
a
caramel
malt
a
little
honey
and
some
alcohol
overall
it
was
a
fairly
good
beer
except
for
a
few
little
rough
patches
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
looking
to
try
different
winter
beers
overall
a
beer
that
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
very
small
hidden
flavors
are
all
around
at
times
it
doesnt
meld
well
together

taste
is

very

very

quiet
spiced
with

probably
moderate
bitterness
and
a
overal
dry
carracter
not
exactly
balanced
mouthfeel
and
cant
think
it
was
ment
to
taste
like
this
drinkable
but
was
hard
to
get
a
good
amount
in
the
glass
with
this
fontin
comming
out
while
opening
the
bottle
pours
an
even
murky
red
color
not
much

just
a
bleak
bubbly
crown
aroma
is
metallic
and
nutty
reminiscent
of
a
brown
some
malty
sugars
bring
this
into
belgian
aroma
mildly
not
at
all
what
i
expect
from
a
belgie
noel
which
is
hugeness
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
in
a
medium
way
big
on
carbonation
and
spry
despite
its
age
1
yr
smooth
and
creamy
sugar
evolution
from
belgian
malts
evoke
brown
sugar
and
very
light
fruits
not
at
all
bad
and
probably
one
of
the
best
petrus
beer
out
there
unfortunately
their
best
doesnt
measure
up
to
whats
available
out
there
in
belgium
still
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
not
at
all
a
winter
closer
to
a
dubbel
try
it
for
shots
and
goggles
i
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
belgian
glass
the
beer
is
a
deep
amber
color
and
unbelievably
bubbly
you
can
watch
the
bubbles
shoot
to
the
top
the
whole
time
you
drink
it
the
aroma
is
clean
and
refreshing
but
very
understated
the
first
sips
are
slightly
malty
perhaps
a
bit
oaky
and
you
are
left
with
a
slightly
hoppy
very
slight
and
very
dry
tingle
on
the
tongue
this
beer
tastes
much
lighter
than
youd
expectfor
a
winter
beer
it
is
very
light

year
round
drinker
if
you
ask
me

was
translucent

with
tons
of

decanted
carefully
head
settles
at
half
height
and
lacing
is
average

good
aroma
is
lightly
of

and
sweetness

lacking
here
for
a
belgian
taste
is
lightly
spicy
malts
with
delicate
hopping
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
expected
much
better
even
though
i
will
admit
the
bar
was
probably
set
high
this
was
an
older
bottle
maybe
2
years
according
to
the
store
rep
beyond
the
particulate
juggle
winterbier
was
enjoyable
a
clean
copperorange
beer
has
a
big
beige
headwith
some
lace
the
aroma
has
at
first
a
fruity
sweetness
which
becomes
more
of
a
malty
sweetness
and
there
is
strong
sour
note
in
the
background
the
flavor
starts
of
with
a
smooth
maltiness
that
flows
right
into
a
light
sour
note
this
all
finishes
with
a
nice
spicey
peppery
bite
on
the
end
hushed
almost
still
aromatics
are
doughy
and
pulpy
brown
breads
vanilla
raisins
and
sweet
spices
are
just
barely
there
in
the
mouth
its
creamy
with
wooly
tannins
ripe
red
berries
black
pepper
and
starchy
spice
husks
occupy
the
broad
texture
beautifully
vigorous
fine
fizz
provides
an
equal
amount
of
structure
as
the
nutty
tangy
bitter
extractions
its
bone
dry
a
surprise
considering
all
of
the
sweet
aromatics
this
brew
is
a

along
with

nothing
amazing
but
not
the

of
the
world
drinkability
wish
the
abv
was
a
tad
more
so
it
would
cross
over
to
the
sweet
side
but
as
it
is
its
a
pretty
good
winter
beer
was
about
what
i
was
expecting
what
makes
petrus
winterbier
a
winter
beer
isnt
immediately
obvious
it
tastes
like
a
belgian
dark
ale
and
not
an
especially
noteworthy
one
i
have
little
doubt
that
if
it
had
been
more
appropriately
carbonated
it
would
have
been
a
much
better
beer
as
is
ill
shed
no
tears
over
what
was
lost
on
my
desktop
overall
this
was
a
pretty
big
disappointment
petrus
winterbier
was
onedimensional
and
pretty
listless
with
all
the
other
christmas
beers
available
i
wont
be
back
for
another
one
of
these
again
not
horrible
but
nothing
special
either
a
decent
beer
but
not
quite
as
special
as
bavik
would
like
you
to
think
with
the
christmas
packaging
promotion
a
run
of
the
mill
double
not
worth
the
extra
price
save
yer
money
and
go
get
yourself
a
6er
of
new
belgium
abbey
this
beer
exploded
out
of
the
bottle
as
if
it
was
a
shaken
bottle
of
champaign
what
ended
up
in
the
glass
was
a
nice
reddish
amber
with
a
huge
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
spicy
and
wine
like
the
taste
is
very
mild
there
isnt
a
lot
of
flavor
it
is
highly
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
overall
its
pretty
good
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
often
as
disturbing
looking
as
this
one
poured
it
was
darn
good
pours
a
translucent
light
brownslight
copper
color
with
a
pretty
white
mediumsized
head
aroma
is
sweetish
with
a
lightly
raosted
malt
and
gentle
spiciness
the
aroma
is
soft
and
gentle
compared
to
many
winter
offerings
flavor
follows
through
from
the
aroma
no
big
surprises
nice
winter
spice
touch
but
everything
soft
and
gentle
good
but
hard
to
find
anything
that
really
grabs
me
fruity
and
slightly
spicy
in
flavor
with
a
lot
of
lemon
citrus
to
it
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
though
not
overdone
and
begins
to
warm
the
body
very
quickly
this
tastes
much
more
like
a
lighter
belgian
ale
than
the
darker
brew
it
actually
is
im
not
blown
away
or
anything
but
its
pretty
tasty
bronze
in
color
with
a
good
deal
of
tan
head
that
recedes
a
bit
faster
than
i
expected
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
i
expected
wrong
a
syrupy
brew
spicey
with
a
prickly
but
just
shy
of
medium
mouthfeel
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
still
very
tastey
the
sixxer
comes
with
a
nice
bottle
opener
too
beautiful
dark
amber
beer
that
casts
a
deep
ruby
glow
when
held
up
to
the
light
this
beer
is
topped
by
a
voluminous
cream
colored
head
that
seems
to
hold
indefinately
aroma
is
a
bit
spicy
with
a
yeast
aroma
that
is
typical
of
belgianstyled
beers
decent
phenols
and
such
but
nothing
noteworthy
the
flavor
is
actually
very
clean
and
rather
mild
a
good
dose
of
what
tastes
like
coriander
is
present
throughout
and
theres
a
touch
of
dry
sweetness
on
the
finish
otherwise
its
just
a
typical
dry
belgianstyled
ale
perhaps
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
most
as
well
this
beer
looks
nice
but
otherwise
is
just
a
typical
ale
in
holidy
garb
a
rustcolored
brew
with
a
head
that
stays
quite
well
and
leaves
some
lace
aroma
suggests
sweet
fruits
and
citrus
with
a
lemon
twang
and
a
touch
of
spiciness
from
the
yeast
spicy
hops
and
yeast
on
the
tongue
but
without
the
maltiness
and
fullbody
that
i
usually
expect
from
a
winter
beer
not
much
complexity
either
too
much
carbonation
for
a
good
mouthfeel
not
bad

a
good
beer
though
not
amongst
the
best
of
the
holiday
season
still
if
i
saw
it
i
might
have
it
again
there
are
far
better
belgian
beers
that
i
would
recommend
over
this
one
this
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
the
bland
beer
drinking
masses
come
to
think
of
it
share
this
beer
with
the
uninitiated
they
would
really
enjoy
it
while
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
i
just
found
it
to
be
plain
its
not
bad
its
not
good
its
simply
average
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
deep
ruby
color
with
a
mastodonic
head
creamy
in
texture
and
a
bright
light
tan
color
with
the
lace
forming
a
tight
sealing
sheet
that
smothers
the
glass
the
nose
is
vanilla
sweet
with
a
thick
malt
presence
also
a
bit
of
over
ripe
banana
noticed
a
very
pleasing
and
a
bodement
of
things
to
come
front
is
ambrosial
rich
in
malt
with
a
middling
top
that
leads
to
a
strikingly
acidic
finish
hops
are
personable
in
their
spicy

desert
dry
aftertaste
that
lingers

on

a

end
of

and
as
a
beer
i
salute
all
beer
lovers
where
ever
you
are
on
this
thanksgiving
eve
in
2003
hopefully
next
year
at
this
time
we
can
give
thanks
for
world
peace
a
dream
but
it
is
my
wish
today
i
would
like
to
think
that
this
is
just
an
old
poorly
caredfor
bottle
a
pleasant
experience
this
beer
was
not
uck
i
thought
this
was
a
bit
light
for
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
and
said
so
myself
during
my
03
review
but
during
the
style
revisions
this
one
was
changed
to
a
belgian
dark
ale
having
said
that
it
was
pretty
darn
good
i
rerated
this
bad
boy
and
overall
the
score
went
from
a
3
05
to
a
solid
4

come
into
play
how
old
are
these

its
thin
white

drops
readily
but
it
maintains
a
creamy
collar
throughout
the

the

a

its
alcohol
becomes

as
it
warms
its

its

theres
more

indicates
and
the
vanilla
remains
along
with
some
light
caramel
and
rum
its
exceptionally
wellbalanced
by
a
restrained

and
the

nothing

still
tasty
at

the
six
pack
came
with
a
cool
wooden
bottle
opener
i
was
expecting
a
more
flamboyant
brew
the
wife
picked
this
up
for
me
i
was
none
to
impressed
by
anything
but
the
bottle
something
about
a
fat
man
on
a
sled
some
earthiness
and
hops
but
overall
not
a
very
exciting
ale
it
did
have
a
little
tart
sting
to
t
but
just
noneventful
for
a
winter
styled
ale
this
brew
really
lacks
a
lot
of
hearty
characteristics
to
give
it
the
enjoyable
palette
one
would
hope
to
have
in
its
presentation
disappointing
all
the
way
around
instead
get
one
from

but
the
8
4
oz

is
entirely
too
small
an
okay
beer
but
a
bit
underwhelming
for
a
winterchristmas
beer
especially
a
belgian
one
considering
the
price
tag
i
wont
be
having
this
again
poured
a
murky

brown
aroma
was
a
crisp
white

fairly
light
in

grapelike
white
wine
up

quickly
fading
into
a
mildly
bitter
and
dry
finish
not
much
middle
to
this
beer
it
zips
from
start
to
finish
and
is
gone
it
is
deceptively
easy
to
drink
stacked
up
against
other
belgian
beers
it
does
not
have
much
depth
and
falls
short
but
for
some
darn
reason
i
like
it
anyway
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
belgian
lawnmower
beer
this
beer
poured
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
warm
with
hints
of
orange
peel
coriander
and
mace
in
the
back
ground
i
was
however
disappointed
with
the
taste
and
body
of
this
beer
it
started
out
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
spice
and
carbonation
there
was
even
a
hint
of
hop
spiciness
heading
into
the
finish
but
then
there
was
nothing
no
after
taste
or
lingering
alcohol
or
spicy
warmth
for
such
a
great
start
it
had
a
disappointing
finish
there

give
me
a
break
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thick
white
head

tight
bubbles
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
initially
spicy
with
the
smell
of
malt
noticeable
after
a
moment
the
taste
is
spicy
and
sour
at
first
sip
followed
by
some
slight
malt
and
hop
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
id
consider
this
a
drinkable


would
be
a
nice
change
on
occasion

decent
amount
of

that
whittles
down
to
a
thin
caked

s
some
earthy
malt
up
front
the
hops
are
a
bit
of
an
afterthought
t
a
little
thin
at
the
start
then
the
malt
makes
an
entrance
with
some
vaguely
citrusy
hops
im
having
a
hard
time
quanitifying
it
because
its
pretty
passive

around

d
im
not
really
completely
over

about

then
again
its

abhorrent
with
its

could
definitely

was
a
golden
amber
color
and
a
little
hazy
it
had
a
large
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
left
some
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
light

and
hops
the
taste
was
light

and
a
little
spice
with
a
dry

it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
and
definitely
not
worth
the
three
bucks
i
paid
for
the
bottle
d
ugh
i
passed
this
one
off
to
a
friend
halfway
through
it
is
not
worht
having
i
have
had
other
pertrus
bavik
beers
that
i
would
recommend
this
one
is
far
short
of
speciale
oelergud
the
appearance
was
actually
really
good
lots
of
sticky
white
foam
with
clumpy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
not
so
strong
you
can
detect
a
belgiany
yeast
in
the
aroma
but
barely
not
unlike
the
aroma
of
kwak
to
my
recollection
the
flavor
was
also
not
strong
actually
it
was
not
bad
a
little
1dimensional
but
youre
expecting
more
when
you
see
its
their
speciale
easy
to
drink
nice
summer
beer
an
enjoyable
surprise
not
bad
but
ultimately
a
disappointment
aftertaste
is
clean
and
fresh
but
still
lacking
in
dimension
petrus
speciale
is
brewed
in
belgium
but
doesnt
taste
like
it
something
that
is
pretty
rare
in
my
experience
four
packs
hit
des
moines
sometime
in
the
past
year
a
development
that
i
was
initially
excited
about
after
having
tasted
it
im
excited
no
longer
this
is
far
from
a
belgian
dark
ale
i
will
notify
the
beerfly
for
a
change
upside
looks
innoffensive
downside
lack
of
depth
boring
petrus
speciale
ale
pours
a
pretty
subdued
rust
color
with
a
delicate
lacy
head
aromas
are
fairly
fruity
with
apples
plums
and
some
citrus
notes
present
on
the
palate
though
things
flatten
out
a
bit
with
little
of
the
interesting
fruits
in
the
nose
making
their
way
into
the
body
some
sourness
is
in
there
kind
of
like
you
get
in
some
english
pale
ales
mild
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
not
unpleasantly
so
but
the
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
wheres
the
beef
feeling
i
get
from
this
one
overall
an
unoffensive
belgian
that
also
lacks
character
taste
is
slightly
acidic
and
dry
a
slight
bitterness
and
dry
aftertaste
mark
this
beer
again
the
wood
comes
through
and
i
think
this
inhibits
drinkability
a
little
bit
overall
a
good
beer
which
i
would
review
as
a
blond
or
belgian
pale
ale
not
as
a
dark
ale
who
made
that
up
odd
stale
funky
mouthfeel
with
a
flavor
combination
of
orange
peel
and
sweaty
gym
socks
this
is
by
far
the
worst
of
the
petrus
lineup
yet
they
choose
to
call
it
speciale
if
thats
not
irony
i
dont
know
what
is
mouthfeel
is
clean
but
there
is
nothing
here
bland
this
is
the
budweiser
of
belgian
beers
more
so
than
stella
this
sucks
while
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised
by
much
of
the
petrus
line
i
wish
id
skipped
this
one
33

thats
lasting
a

and
leaving

and

crisp
and
refreshing
a
little

comes
through

but
the
finish
is
dry
and
healthily
carbonated
almost
prickly

excellent

i
could
consume
a
few
of
i
can
really
love
the
lighter
belgians
especially
their
models

i
would
argue
that
this
is
underrated
and

indeed

nice
brownish
red
brew
with
lots

not
terrible
but
nothing
great
either
taste
is
good
malty
and
mild
mouthfeel
is
unoffensive
not
overly
carbonated
pretty
smooth
and
pretty
drinkable
too
not
a
bad
choice
one
of
the
six
petrus
beers
from
a
gift
pack
this
one
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
pertinent
light
tan
frothy
head
that
after
depletion
leaves
a
fine
veil
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
crisp
citrus
like
front
wit
ha
bit
of
malt
at
the
back
start
is
somewhat
sweet
nice
grain
presence
and
the
top
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
sternly
acidic
the
hops
benign
in
their
spiciness
desert
bone
dry
and
a
fine
brew
to
start
off
a
sunday
afternoon
of
sampling
overall
triple
aaasadly
that
means
an
average
amber
poured
into
the
petrus
glass
the
colour
is
a
bit
of
a
bronzeamberorange
hue
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
grassy
earthy
and
a
bit
musky
the
malt
is
present
and
reminds
of
a
digestif
cookie
taste
starts
out
tart
cranberries
perhaps
and
other
tart
fruits
green
apples
bit
of
citrus
though
that
is
likely
from
a
hop
leaves
simplistic
and
sweet
again
like
a
digestif
cookie
but
more
crisp
biscotti
mouthfeel
is
medium
oily
and
slick
unfortunately
for
some
reason
i
dont
find
this
very
drinkable
im
not
sure
why
this
is
my
second
bottle
and
i
still
cant
put
my
finger
on
why
this
doesnt
appeal
to
me
though
i
admit
the
scores
are
good
best
till
110305
so
just
in
time
to
see
how
this
beer
does
pours
in
without
much
carbonation
and
its
hard
to
get
a
head
up
on
the
beer
in
the
glas
reasonably
clear
and
has
a
nice
bronze
colour
smell
is
not
much
at
all
litle
oxidation
and
hardly
any
malt
or
yest
caracter
were
there
ever
hops
to
be
smelled
taste
is
as
dull
as
the
nose
was
water
with
alcohol
and
malts
being
used
as
well
dry
and
litle
hoppy
aftertaste
drinkable
but
far
from
great
pours
an
amber
body
creamy

good
retention

is
uninteresting
faint
hops
floralherbal
but
not
much
else
its
astringent
hoppy
floral
spicy
and
has
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
carbonation
is
strong
like
a
soda
water
quite
drinkable
but
this
is
no
belgian
ale
seems
to
be
miscategorized
here
on
ba
but
its
quite
drinkable
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
leaves
behind
swathes
of
lace
the
aroma
is
biscuity
like
an
english
pale
ale
it
also
has
a
nice
grassy
quality
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
subtle
spicyness
and
a
decent
amount
of
herbal
hoppiness
this
beer
could
be
a
little
richer
though
its
still
very
tasty
a
well
balanced
pale
ale
250
ml

with
a
nice
tight
off

cap
fair
effervescence
in
the
glass
aromas
of
apples

pears
with
a
musty
yeast
note
starts
tart
and
peppery
then
goes
very
slick
with
malt
and
tangy
fruit
pronouncments
then
the
finish
is
long
where
the
malts
fade
and
a
sour
apple
taste
remains
slight
warming
nice
brew
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
like
this
better
than
the
triple

poured
a

brown
beer
with
a
nice
huge
head
with
above
standard
retention
carbonation
is
great
with
floral
aroma
medium
body
with
sweet
taste
a
bit
disappointed
with
that
one
the
spice
mix
is
almost
nonpresent
and
the
body
is
too
light
with
a
bit
of
a
watery
aftertaste
note
i
find
it
a
bit
weird
that
this
beer
from
a
belgium
brewery
has
only
been
review
so
far
by
canadian
ba
drinkability
nt
that
speciale
after
all
looks
good
but
mostly
an
average
quaff
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
i
would
recomend
it
330

be
careful
when
serving
it
it
pours
an
enormous
persistent
off
white
head
dark
brown
colour
semell
of
coffee
dark
fruits
cherries
and
caramel
thin
body
much
more
than
i
expected
not
a
strong
palate
taste
of
chocolate
dark
fruitssome
licorice
and
average
beer
for
the
style
imo
a
ruby
brown
color
takes
its
shape
in
the
glass
topping
it
is
a
thick
rocky
head
which
retains
for
very
long
aroma
offers
soft
plum
yeast
and
minerals
so
its
just
about
on
target
the
taste
is
a
little
more
relevent
which
brings
plum
toasted
bread
vague
fruit
and
cherry
a
kiss
of
banana
gets
noticed
but
the
alcohol
does
not
its
medium
bodied
which
finishes
off
this
pleasant
dark
ale
which
i
head
with
my
lunch
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
chestnut
brown
with
ruby
edges
and
a
light
toffe
colored
head
the
nose
has
candied
sugars
and
carmelized
brown
sugar
with
a
light
metal
twang
very
water
light
yeast
note
and
some
faint
pear
the
taste
is
heavily
sugar
based
carmelized
brown
sugar
and
candied
sugars
primarily
with
a
touch
of
yeast
light
nut
and
pear
in
the
back
watery

taste
and
in
body
thin
and
low
carbonation
a
nice

smooth
and
welcoming
osurprised
in
the
lack
of
complexity
in
this
beer
thought
their
blonde
was
very
good
but
this
one
was
missing
that
same
kind
of
depth
o
a
good
beer
but
not
impressive
and
good
to
drink
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruits
consisting
of
figs
and
raisins
in
the
taste
dark
fruits
but
a
bit
watery
and
muted
flavors
a
smooth
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
dark
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
decent
but
quite
watery
which
made
everything
a
bit
muted
dark
reddish
brown
roasted
malt
nose
very
light
palais
syrupy
caramel
and
liquorice
which
is
more
or
less
on
the
palate
but
without
much
conviction
some
dryness
of
roasted
malt
comes
in
the
finish
but
it
still
sounds
too
artificial
to
be
convincing
it
was
a
bit
like
coming
face
to
a
model
a
copy
of
the
leffe
brune
which
is
not
really
a
compliment
drinking
the
beer
was
an
experience
and
i
recommend
drinking
this
one
slowly
and
really
take
in
the
different
flavors
as
they
come
and
go
throughout
it
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
several
throughout
the
night
slightly
bitter
the
caramel
and
molasses
flavors
mix
well
on
the
palate
a
bit
of
a
coffeetoffeechocolate
flavor
combination
comes
through
later
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
refreshing
and
warming
nice

a
mild
belgian
nothing

it
wasnt

be
did
pour

the

is

beer
d
one
of
the
low
points
beerwise

underwhelming
for
the

effervescent
white

disappears
quickly
and
leaves
little

aroma
of
malt
nuts

is
cloyingly
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
not
much
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
little
finish
nothing

drinkability
is
good
its
a

i
appreciated
the
relatively
lower

for
a
dubbel
particularly
in
the
drinkability
category
ontap
in
some
town
near

served
in

not

tasty
dubbel

brown
a
bit
of
cocoa

was
fairly

i
wouldnt

good

but
there
are
better
ones

in

at

in
my
opinion
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
that
was
hazy
with
a
nice
head
and
was
incredibly
smooth
for
a
dark
belgian
ale
it
could
have
been
the
fact
i
was
several
belgians
deep
already
by
the
time
i
came
across
this
one
but
i
liked
this
one
sweeter
than
your
typical
belgians
of
the
same
style
the
smell
is
rich
fruity
and
wheaty
the
malt
appears
in
the
taste
as
an
added
sweetness
slight
enough
i
mussay
and
blends
in
properly
with
all
the
fruit
ranges
not
very
bitter
at
the
end
and
full
bodied
with
little
carbonation
making
it
a
nice
experience
appearance
reddish
brown
decent
head
smell
not
much
aroma
aside
from
a
little
candi
sugar
taste
bland
somewhat
thin
tasting
seems
more
of
a
simple
brown
ale
not
flander
brown
than
a
dubbel
or
dark
strong
ale
but
has
no
rummy
caramel
complex
malt
flavors
sweet
sugary
finish
on
the
pour
a
deep
garnet
with
hints
of
mahogany
the
head
is
ponderous
in
size
creamy
in
consistency
and
a
winsome
light
tan
in
color
after
desiccation
the
residual

a
fine

sheet
nose
is
malt
sweet
caramel
fresh
and
crisp
with
a

laden
and
sweet

the

middling

the
finish
is
stinging
in
its
acidity
the
hops
purposeful
in
their
spicy

dry
and

quite
a
nice
drinking
beer
but
about

for
the
style

its

super
light
belgian
dark
not
a
huge
fan
honestly
o
i
cant
say
much
screamed
belgian
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
hop
bombs
consumed
before
it

nice

and
a
shame
i
cant
drink
this
on

in
denver
though
i
should
just
be
happy
to
see
any
russian

at
all
tried

some

no

pretty
solid

and
seems
very
similar
to
salvation
to
me
o
this
was
very
good
but
far
overshadowed
by
pliny
the
younger
for
which
i
was
there
that
day
definitely
worth
a
try
but
dont
use
it
on
valentines
day
as
a
coping
mechanism
for
any
rejection
that
might
come
your
way
if
you
can
use
pliny
on
tap
at
the
brew
pub
served
in
a
goblet
this
beer
had
a
thin
topping
of
tan
head
that
quickly
receded
black
aromas
of
dark
malts
not
picking
up
any
yeast
flavor
is
indeed
malty
this
beer
tastes
like
a
porter
to
me
not
sure
what
makes
it
belgian
inspiredmaybe
a
hint
of
esters
in
there
but
it
is
weak
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
a
flavorful
beer
that
is
average
but
solid
o
if
you
are
within
a
couple
of
hours
of
the
brewery
this
beer
may
be
worth
the
trip
if
you
like
belgian
beers
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on

of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the

on

down

is
of

some

taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to

another
tick
on
the
russian
river
tion
quest
that
i
started
quite
awhile
back
big
thanks
goes
out
to
estocker
for
sending
me
this
one
a
long
time
back
shared
this
one
the
day
after
aashers
wedding
while
the
entire
wedding
party
was
hanging
out
by
the
pool
in
the
destin
fl
sun
a
growler
gusher
served
from
growler
into
a
boulevard
tulip
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
two
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
extremely
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
roasted
malt
bread
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cream
banana
fruit
and
bread
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
was
really
surprised
that
this
one
held
up
as
well
as
it
did
after
over
a
year
of
being
stored
in
my
fridge
surprisingly
there
were
quite
a
few
noncraft
beer
enthusiasts
at
this
pool
party
and
a
lot
of
them
really
liked
this
brew
upon
sampling
it
this
was
a
good
thing
as
it
would
have
been
hard
for
aasher
and
i
to
pound
the
entire
64
oz
growler
there
were
lots
of
nice
notes
going
on
here
that
kept
your
palate
guessing
on
each
sip
which
was
a
nice
aspect
it
was
also
refreshing
making
it
easy
to
drink
out
in
the
extremely
hot
weather
definitely
a
must
try
this
one
gushed
a
bit
out
of
the
growler
it
pours
a
medium
bodied
cola
brown
in
color
with
a
two
finger
creamy
beige
head
the
nose
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
dry
dark
malt
character
and
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
its
light
and
dry
somewhere
between
a
belgian
brune
and
an
irish
dry
stout
its
pretty
mellow
yet
sessionable
its
a
nice
belgian
dark
ale
just
nothing
crazy
b
overall
another
pretty
good
tion
beer
but
not
a
terribly
interesting
style
im
not
sure
of
the
style
of
this
one
but
it
seems
like
a
belgian
black
ale
o
an
easy
drinking
dark
belgian
relatively
low
alcohol
makes
this
quite
quaffable
not
one
of
my
favorite
rr
beers
but
id
never
turn
this
down
cheers
t
floral
hops
upfront
followed
by
some
day
old
coffee
and
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
and
anise
as
well
i
didnt
get
much
of
a
belgian
feel
from
this
at
all
and
i
feel
like
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
could
have
given
this
one
a
little
more
depth
which
it
needed
a
relatively
simple
belgian
dark
porter
good
but
not
great
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
ontap
only
treat
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
roasted
dark
malt
as
well
as
some
zesty
spice
and
sweet
dark
fruit
notes
lots
of
dark
chocolate
malt
flavor
along
with
hints
of
toffee
coffee
bean
and
caramel
countered
by
peppery
spice
candy
sugar
and
dark
fruit
which
provide
subtle
sweetness
still
the
dark
malts
dominate
the
flavor
lingering
into
a
dry
finish
o
mouthfeel
aside
this
is
a
strong
offering
that
is
different
than
any
other
belgian
dark
i
have
had
but
hey
different
is
good
solid
offering
from
rr
m
the
porterlike
belgian
ale
surprised
me
dark
and
forboding
but
quite
drinkable
plus
im
never
one
to
turn
russian
river
down
the
overall
and
drinkability
of
rejection
is
good
it
has
a
fairly
unique
flavor
profile
not
something
i
personally
would
crave
but
i
would
not
turn
down
another
taste
since
its
a
limited
yearly
release
its
worth
a
try
though
and
i
was
glad
that
i
got
the
chance
to
taste
this

with
just
a
touch
of
roast
and
mild

in
the

bring
a

barely
leans
on

with
a
definite
yeasty
touch
but
also
very
clean

release
another
semidisappointment
from
this
day
rejection
isnt
bad
but
my
standard
for
rr
is
unbelievably
high
and
this
beer
is
fairly
forgettable
and
outshone
by
almost
all
of
the
rest
of
the
menu
it
pours
coffee
black
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
theres
a
fair
bit
more
candi
sugar
presence
than
expected
the
flavor
is
mostly
coffeecocoa
with
some
background
malt
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
bit
grainy
leading
to
a
somewhat
thin
watery
finish
this
wasnt
great
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
down
a
glass
either
its
hard
to
tell
how
much
the
riches
of
sf
beer
week
are
effecting
my
relative
rating
scale
o
this
beer
just
struck
a
chord
with
me
bravo
another
grest
rr
brew
d
another
offering
from
russian
river
that
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
but
somewhat
of
a
let
down
of
course
im
still
glad
to
have
been
able
to
get
a
glass
enjoyed
this
over
conversation
but
while
not
heartbroken
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
by
it
mouthfeel
is
a
full
medium
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
is
one
of
the
better
parts
of
the
beer
drinkabilityi
would
drink
it
if
it
was
the
only
rr
beer
i
could
get
but
there
are
just
soooo
many
better
choices
notes
awesome
amazingly
drinkable
and
unique
beer
i
missed
this
one
last
year
and
forgot
how
good
this
beer
tastes
a
nice
seasonal
beer
that
is
unique
and
tasty
thoughts
for
a
belgian
dark
ale
i
would
not
have
expected
any
roasted
barleycoffee
flavors
that
i
would
expect
from
a
porter
however
it
worked
very
nicely
with
this
brew
and
was
indeed
very
tasty
i
liked
this
nice
balance
between
the
roasted
and
sweeter
notes
and
the
more
yeasty
esters
knew
their
place
in
the
profile
plus
there
was
a
robust
hoppy
freshness
about
the
whole
thing
that
only
russian
river
can
do
this
drank
nicely
for
an
over
6
beer
as
well

obriens
tion
night
poured

dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
short
rapidly
fading
offwhite
head
roasted
malt
and
smoked
aroma
some
chocolate
loose
mouthfeel
and
felt
kind
of
flat
grainy
and
malty
up
front
but
more
earthy
than
roasted
it
was
hard
to
determine
if
the
bitterness
was
from
the
chocolate
flavors
or
brett
either
way
it
was
pleasantly
unusual
bits
of
coffee
and
dried
fruits
popped
up
here
and
there
overall
the
taste
was
muted
not
necessarily
watery
but
weaker
than
wished
for
m
d
medium
body
with
noticeable
carbonation
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
a
very
interesting
beer
d
due
to
its
limited
availability
in
my
area
i
was
glad
to
get
it
on
tap
once
but
i
could
have
drank
much
more
a
nice
low
abv
belgian
sytle
that
i
could
drink
year
round
beer
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
rather
large
fluffy
offwhite
head
the
intense
carbonation
and
head
surprised
me
pleasantly
coming
from
a
growler
the
smell
is
dark
with
roasted
malt
the
primary
scent
also
some
wood
licorice
and
root
taste
is
pretty
much
similar
there
are
some
light
chocolate
and
anis
flavors
but
the
roasty
earthy
taste
is
most
noticeable
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
much
more
sessionable
than
others
from
rr
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
not
terribly
memorable
and
not
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
rr
very
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
try
drinkability
is
quite
good
solid
dark
belgian
beer
not
an
earth
shattering
powerhouse
of
flavors
just
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
very
sessionable
a
great
beer
that
stands
alone
amongst
many
others
there
at
rr
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
arrives
in
a
stubby
wine
glass
the
correct
name
for
which
is
not
in
my
vocabulary
looks
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
quarter
inch
light
brown
head
and
good
retention
smells
yeasty
and
biscuity
with
some
vague
fruit
definitely
smells
like
a
belgian
style
beer
but
its
not
clear
what
style
exactly
flavor
has
definite
fruit
and
yeasty
veins
strong
malt
undertone
and
a
slight
roasted
note
roasted
flavor
makes
me
think
porter
but
its
not
that
by
any
means
a
bit
overly
dry
on
the
finish
where
more
fruit
flavor
would
be
welcome
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
creamyfrothy
mouthfeel
a
nice
drinker
despite
the
dryness
d
easy
to
drink
but
would
probably
rank
this
amongst
the
few
rr
beers
that
i
dont
care
for
too
much
d
if
this
beer
wasnt
so
dry
i
would
have
quite
a
few
more
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
new
creatively
named
valentines
day
beer
color
was
black
taste
was
dry
bitter
and
to
me
burnt
with
a
thin
mouthful
i
did
not
like
it
at
all
but
maybe
my
palette
was
too
soured
out
by
vinnes
other
masterpieces
im
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
maybe
with
food
and
maybe
ill
like
it
more
had
low
expectations
for
this
beer
was
way
better
than
i
thought
not
sure
why
i
felt
this
way
but
hey
the
beer
was
awesome
awesome
color
nice
lacing
head
balance
with
acidity
coco
coffee
not
a
long
finish
but
very
fun
and
enjoyable
would
go
great
with
food
glad
to
have
tried
this
rare
brew
not
my
favorite
beer
from
rr
but
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
had
this
on
tap
at
russian
river
brewery
today
described
on
the
chalk
board
as
a
belgian
black
ale
or
something
like
that
and
black
it
is
with
a
nice
tan
head
smell
and
taste
are
essentially
dark
roasted
notes
a
little
coffee
but
lighter
than
a
stout
by
far
pretty
drinkable
brew
but
with
so
many
other
delicious
options
at
the
brewery
one
is
enough
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
easy
to
drink
if
you
know
what
you
are
getting
into
definatly
not
for
those
who
just
like
beer
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
frothy
head
that
reduces
rather
quickly
aroma
is
toasty
malt
and
coffee
with
a
touch
of
fleshy
fruit
flavor
is
of
those
sees
coffee
flavored
candies
with
some
roasty
bitterness
and
smoke
chewy
and
sticky
really
smooth
and
drinkable
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
smell
is
of
belgiam
yeast
dark
chocolate
and
deep
roasted
malt
taste
is
a
dark
chocolate
burnt
malt
very
much
like
a
good
porter
with
a
hint
of
the
sweet
distinct
belgium
yeast
flavor
a
very
good
beer
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
having
twice
now
and
would
get
again
when
available
drinkability
highly
drinkable
stuff
despite
being
my
last
beer
of
the
day
vinnie
has
a
nice
touch
with
these
belgianstyle
brews
overall
this
beer
is
great
i
would
drink
it
any
day
and
i
would
definately
drink
it
if
i
was
rejected
d
great
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
at
6
abv
and
they
are
very
enjoyable
obviously
not
as
much
flavor
or
punch
as
a
riss
but
still
a
lot
going
on
and
an
interesting
beer
though
im
still
not
sure
what
beers
to
compare
it
to
from
my
notes
on
recent
trip
poured
into
a
sampling
glass
arrived
with
no
head
pretty
dark
brown
in
color
aroma
is
a
bit
odd
definitely
some
toasted
malt
in
there
but
cant
pin
down
the
odd
funk
to
it
taste
is
again
kind
of
funky
the
malts
roasty
some
chocolate
and
perhaps
smoked
not
what
i
expected
out
of
a
belgian
dark
though
not
actually
all
that
bad
just
well
rejected
body
is
above
average
good
consistency
and
after
i
got
used
to
it
it
wasnt
all
half
that
bad
one
is
all
i
need
though
drinkability
terrific
aroma
subtle
flavors
with
a
nice
woody
finish
overall
its
a
while
since
i
had
a
dark
brew
from
russian
river
but
overall
this
one
was
not
really
to
my
palate
to
be
honest
i
made
a
point
to
try
this
one
early
on
so
i
think
i
avoided
the
faded
palate
scenario
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
russian
river
definitely
unique
but
i
would
give
this
one
a
whirl
again
if
i
get
chance
drinkability
fairly
odd
tasting
beer
kinda
like
a
swartzbier
except
not
a
lager
not
as
sweet
in
the
malt
as
well
just
odd
worth
a
try
though
hopefully
some
other
soul
can
it
describe
better
all
i
can
advise
is
to
leave
a
style
mindset
at
the
door
it
was
pretty
good
and
although
not
as
good
as
good
as
the
top
of
the
russian
river
class
it
was
still
a
damn
fine
adult
beverage
i
myself
will
try
my
hardest
to
get
back
for
another
taste
before
its
gone
and
perhaps
even
get
a
growler
next
time
unique
and
pleasing
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
pours
a
mediumdark
brown
with
a
moderate
head
pleasant
aromatic
aroma
with
burnt
sugar
and
vanilla
notes
a
pleasantly
sweet
malty
taste
with
an
abrupt
slightly
bitter
finish
with
grapefruit
notes
certainly
a
well
crafted
belgian
dark
but
the
abv
borders
on
a
strong
dark
although
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
a
belgian
strong
dark
would
have
considerably
more
flavor
to
reward
the
consumption
american
craft
breweries
like
to
push
the
envelope
of
every
style
and
this
is
no
exception
if
the
alcohol
content
were
lower
in
the
realm
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
it
would
be
exceptional
as
a
belgian
strong
dark
it
is
middle
of
the
road
one
of
the
best
american
beers
ive
ever
drank
dark
smooth
tastes
cold
no
overwhelming
flavors
and
its
8
beautiful
caramel
color
river
horse
has
yet
to
impress
me
not
a
fan
of
dark
ales
but
this
one
is
great
sweet
aftertaste

alot
of
great
beersjust
wish
they
bring
back
hoppalotimus
muddy

water
nose
is
nothing
of
note
taste
eww
metallic
i
had
this
on
tap
so
maybe
its
off
but
not
good
at
all
really
like
the
smell
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
nice
yeasty
taste
appears
a
brownishamber
color
in
appearance
poured
into
goblet
thin

lacing
did
not
last
nice
offering
for
the
winter
alcohol
present
not
too
strong
however
very
nice
mouth
feel
and
carbonation
aroma
some
candy
and
fruit
maybe
licorice
relatively
well
balanced
offering
very
nice
flavor
profile
i
enjoyed
this
version
and
would
and
will
have
again
the
best
thing
that
i
can
say
about
this
offering
is
that
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
overall
like
a
cross
between
a
solid
yet
not
quite
remarkable
northern
brown
ale
and
a
dubbel
of
the
same
caliber
deceptive
sessionability
and
a
good
price
make
this
beer
marketable
but
at
the
same
time
it
lacks
the
complexity
of
other
belgian
ales
aroma
is
incredible
banana
with
bubblegum
peanut
butter
flavor
matches
pretty
well
id
drink
this
again
and
id
include
in
a
belgian
taste

12

into

abv
is
awesome
too
really
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
usually
not
a
fan
of
winter
seasonals
but
this
one
was
rich
in
flavor
dark
but
not
too
dark
and
could
definitely
taste
fruit
caramels
and
other
warm
flavors
not
a
bad
aftertaste
i
get
with
these
wintery
beers
not
too
sweet
either
quite
enjoyable
from
a
small
brewery
near
me
that
ive
really
grown
to
like
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
but
with
no
foam
little
if
any
nose
hard
to
draw
out
any
discernable
scent
slight
cherry
malt
taste
fruity
little
belgian
yeast
taste
hard
to
judge
this
one
not
noteworthy
in
any
direction
probably
need
to
get
another
one
o
a
solid
interpretation
of
the
belgian
dubbel
style
though
definitely
not
as
good
as
the
real
thing
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
dark
ale
from
river
horse
taste
is
great
notes
are
not
as
strong
in
the
nose
12
oz
bottle
from
trader
joes
pours
dark
amber
with
a
tall
foamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
alcohol
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
body
is
full
and
smooth
taste
is
of
bready
malt
caramel
drying
alcohol
earthy
hops
brown
sugar
and
cooked
vegetables
finish
is
long
and
dry
i
will
skip
this
brew
next
time
im
not
that
knowledgeable
about
belgians
in
general
so
take
my
opinion
for
what
its
worth
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
brew
that
i
would
consider
sessionable
if
not
for
the
high
abv
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
it
has
a
reddish
brown
color
body
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
smell
has
a
dark
fruit
and
sweet
aroma
the
taste
has
a
rasain
dark
fruit
flavor
it
also
a
has
a
belgian
yeasty
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
not
heavy
with
medium
body
overall
a
pretty
good
belgium
really
not
bad
for
an
american
belgian
style
ale
i
find
that
fruit
notes
from
the
yeast
like
apple
and
raisin
really
drive
the
beer
but
dont
overwhelm
abv
doesnt
bother
me
but
it
is
not
the
most
well
hidden
overall
bartender
at
southside
grille
recommended
it
after
a
did
a
5
beer
tasting
and
did
not
include
it
i
love
belgian
dark
ales
this
one
is
not
bad
but
is
lacking
some
punch
overall
great
beer
if
you
like
winter
belgians
river
horses
belgian
freeze
pours
an
opaque
burnt
copper
with
just
over
a
finger
of
bone
colored
foam
theres
a
little
bit
of
head
retention
and
not
much
lacing
at
all
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
the
aroma
with
caramel
bready
fig
berry
and
clove
aromas
all
easily
appreciable
the
first
two
are
just
a
little
too
prominent
for
my
taste
though
the
flavor
profile
is
the
same
story
yes
there
are
some
fruity
esters
and
some
clove
like
phenols
and
i
even
enjoy
how
theyre
balanced
relative
to
each
other
with
the
former
shining
more
than
the
latter
the
problem
is
how
prevalent
the
malt
character
is
theres
more
caramel
and
toasty
bread
than
anything
else
the
body
is
headed
in
the
right
direction
dry
but
its
not
quite
light
enough
similarly
theres
some
life
to
the
carbonation
but
i
find
myself
looking
for
even
more
still
the
mouthfeel
is
very
close
to
being
great
belgian
freeze
is
a
pleasant
enough
brew
but
it
just
doesnt
blow
me
away
as
a
belgian
dark
ale
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
easy
to
drink
and
rather
enjoyable
because
it
was
almost
as
flavorful
as
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
while
having
a
lighter
body
overall
there
is
nothing
to
dislike
about
this
beer
it
is
well
crafted
well
balanced
and
very
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
it
also
does
not
challenge
the
style
i
would
drink
this
again
without
a
problem
but
it
is
not
unique
a
sweet
and
tasty
treat
a
great
seasonal
with
awesome
artwork
its
like
drinking
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
ooverall
i
think
this
is
a
great
belgium
ale
to
kick
off
the
winter
season
excellent
flavor
of
the
fruits
for
an
8
beer
but
at
the
same
time
has
that
unique
belgium
characteristic
to
it
overall
to
be
frank
not
as
bad
as
i
feel
some
people
make
it
out
while
not
good
persaynot
horrible
as
the
beer
warms
some
tart
cherry
notes
come
through
which
are
pleasant
in
addition
the
belgian
yeast
is
not
that
noticeable
good
thing
for
me
so
that
bumps
it
up
a
point
or
two
a
decent
beer
to
finish
the
night
with
before
getting
up
early
to
fly
to
miami
for
a
wedding
cheers
overall
taste
makes
this
barely
drinkable
to
me
perhaps
this
just
isnt
my
style
of
beer
overall
very
nice
not
the
best
but
above
average
o
there
wasnt
much
to
the
nose
and
it
tasted
kind
of
weird
i
liked
the
cazeau
tournay
de
noel
better
brew
drinks
well
and
has
good
flavors
an
pretty
good
american
brewed
belgian
dark
ale
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
little
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
fairly
short
finish
that
has
a
kind
of
berry
fruitiness
and
booze
in
the
aftertaste
not
bad
at
all
feels
pretty
authentic
actually
good
job
by
river
horse
not
the
deepest
or
most
subtle
attempt
at
a
belgian
style
beer
but
enjoyable
nonetheless

overall
this
is
a
nice
little
belgian
dark
suitable
as
a
winter
ale
othis
is
an
ok
beer
another
river
horse
brew
that
has
seemed
to
gone
slightly
down
in
quality
in
the
past
few
years
they
still
put
out
great
brews
but
this
is
one
that
seems
to
have
taken
a
blow
o
nicely
balanced
and
easy
drinking
8

is
well
hidden
mainly
consists

this
makes
a
wonderful
winter
treat

liquid
poured
down

rose
up
to
a
height
of
around
two
inches
before
settling
back
down
into
a
frothy
and
foamy
cap
that
stayed
with
it
throughout
the
session
only
real
knock
here
being
too
much
head
if
anything
aroma
was
fairly
light
nice
spice
notes
up
front
hints
of
caramel
dark
prune
like
fruit
notes
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
of
all
things
carried
over
well
in
the
flavor
which
was
equally
rich
strong
notes
of
spice
up
front
and
a
smooth
mellow
texture
that
really
seemed
to
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
earthy
and
herbal
with
nice
hints
of
dark
fruit
i
really
felt
it
summed
up
the
part
quite
well
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
decent
looking
amber
color
the
head
was
pretty
big
at
first
but
settled
into
just
a
thin
layer
over
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
spice
to
it
mixed
with
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
more
of
an
autumn
spiced
beer
than
a
christmas
one
the
flavors
were
mixed
between
sweet
and
spicy
the
mouthfeel
was
alright
nothing
too
crazy
here
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with

drinkability
overall
not
the
most
impressive
brew
ive
had
nice
aromas
and
appearance
but
the
taste
is
somewhat
lacking
great
beer
overall
very
unique
and
has
many
dimensions
to
the
flavor
certainly
recommended
went
to
a
riverhorse
meet
the
brewer
event
and
this
was
one
of
the
taps
served
from
a
small
12
oz
tulip
glass
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
and
found
it
very
true
to
its
belgian
dark
ale
style
definition
a
great
beer
to
sip
by
the
fireplace
not
a
beer
for
guzzling
at
a
tailgate
d
being
a
jersey
boy
im
very
partial
to
riverhorse
but
as
always
a
delicious
brew
two
or
three
might
be
my
cap
but
super
delicious
and
very
enjoyable
beer
is
light
in
body
with
an
odd
bitterness
late
in
the
palate
you
know
this
tastes
like
a
belgian
amber
i
brewed
once
its
estery
and
bright
on
the
palate
well
carbonated
it
tastes
pretty
good
id
have
it
again
this
beer
is
on
the
higher
side
of
medium
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
to
wash
it
down
well
for
the
8
abv
dr
too
much
caramel
too
expensive
d
this
is
a
good
attempt
at
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
doesnt
quite
compare
with
belgian
counterparts
so
far
i
havent
been
impressed
with
river
horse
but
this
is
one
of
their
better
offerings
pours
dark
amber
brown
with
head
that
disappears
into
a
very
thin
ring
on
first
sip
this
beer
approximates
a
belgian
ale
but
on
closer
inspection
it
lacks
balance
and
its
flavors
are
too
disparate
the
nose
is
pungent
maybe
phenolic
it
has
flavors
of
banana
and
spices
but
further
drinking
leads
to
a
very
alcoholic
lingering
bitter
and
drying
taste
all
in
all
i
rate
this
passable
to
ok
it
is
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
seems
to
me
that
belgian
is
used
all
to
often
as
a
style
branding
for
american
beers
when
it
only
uses
the
ingredients
and
not
the
rigor
of
belgian
brewing
m
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
d
i
swore
i
had
this
before
but
it
mustve
have
been
a
different
beer
such
as
dfh
rasion
detre
which
this
reminds
me
of
dfhs
offering
is
a
bit
more
unrefined
in
that
the
alcohol
is
much
more
prevalent
even
so
these
two
are
somewhat
similar
with
this
one
having
a
slightly
better
drinkability
not
my
favorite
i
got
this
beer
in
a
beer
club
mixed
case
the
theme
of
the
case
was
big
beers
with
that
said
so
far
this
is
the
best
that
i
have
had
the
pour
was
from
a
12
oz
bottle
beer
was
about
48
degrees
the
color
was
a
nice
copperdark
amber
color
very
nice
head
with
a
moderate
pour
that
seemed
to
stand
up
well
there
was
some
lacing
ar
i
drank
the
beer
from
a
guinness
glass
the
smell
was
cool
lots
going
on
in
this
beer
the
smell
had
a
spicyfruity
nose
the
taste
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
for
the
alcohol
content
i
taste
the
dark
malts
and
raisins
the
finish
could
be
a
little
smoother
but
overall
a
great
beer
d
nice
to
try
but
no
thanks
i
just
feel
like
this
is
two
opposing
forces
clashing
together
in
a
beer
that
just
does
not
make
much
sense
to
me
i
want
to
like
it
i
really
do
but
it
is
just
not
happening
i
had
this
at
sputen
duyvel
last
night
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
poured
into
a
wine
glass
like
everything
at
that
bar
it
had
a
great
dark
color
and
and
excellent
flavor
that
had
both
the
aroma
and
essence
of
belgian
wheat
with
the
complexity
of
dark
malts
that
was
both
belgian
and
classic
winter
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
it
is
however
unique
enough
to
give
it
a
shot
though
i
probably
would
not
buy
another
whole
pack
of
it
ive
spoken
to
the
brewers
about
it
and
it
seems
to
be
one
of
the
brewerys
most
popular
offerings
so
clearly
many
find
something
in
there
that
i
seem
to
be
missing
overall
yet
another
great
belgian
imitation
from
nj
i
am
really
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
brew
certainly
not
quite
exemplary
of
the
style
but
still
tasty
and
worth
a
try
the
cherry
somewhat
overwhelmed
my
palate
and
there
did
not
seem
to
be
the
balance
the
as
of
the
world
have
poured
a
hazy
bronze
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
banana
clove
nutmeg
and
bubble
gum
the
taste
confirmed
all
of
this
but
also
candi
sugar
coriander
and
lemon
peel
with
a
little
bite
of
dryness
on
the
finish
medium
body
and
decent
carbonation
id
like
to
age
some
of
this
to
see
the
result
definitely
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
unibroue
it
is
not
final
thoughts
not
sure
if
this
beer
is
way
past
its
prime
or
if
this
is
usually
how
it
is
ill
have
to
try
to
revisit
when
its
fresh
its
got
some
nice
dark
fruit
taste
and
good
malts
but
too
much
rotten
fruit
and
phenols
sticky
and
chewy
not
the
best
drinking
experience
md
smooth
and
creamy
feel
very
easy
drinking
good
carbonation
level
almost
nitro
tap
like
feel
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
the
overwhelming
sweetness
makes
it
a
little
tough
to
drink
the
entire
bottle
drinkability
a
good
winter
ale
my
least
favorite
style
shows
off
what
can
be
good
about
the
style
roasty
and
boozy
with
a
little
spice
cool
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
candi
sugar
with
some
dominating
belgian
style
malt
taste
is
also
a
nice
enough
mix
between
some
candi
sugar
and
nice
belgian
malt
with
some
fruity
ester
and
a
lightly
spicy
yeast
body
is
not
as
full
as
i
would
have
liked
it
with
some
good
carbonation
and
no
presence
of
alcohol
not
bad
but
makes
me
want
to
learn
more
from
this
brewery
d
drinkable
sipper
for
sure
at
8
nice
for
a
cold
night
watching
some
hockey
12
ounce
bottle
snatched
from
my
cellar
and
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
appears
a
mildly
hazed
dark
crimson
color
with
about
half
an
inch
of
light
ecru
foam
the
foam
leaves
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
and
tastes
of
caramel
dark
brown
sugar
raisins
lightly
roasted
grains
and
spicy
yeast
rather
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
this
held
up
fairly
well
rich
dark
amber
coloring
little
opaque
with
a
pretty
solid
head
carmelly
malty
smells
very
solid
taste
real
sweet
malts
with
a
nice
little
pop
to
it
belgian
with
a
little
pizzazz
i
like
it
mouthfeel
has
that
pop
i
was
talking
about
making
it
an
easy
drinker
got
a
great
deal
going
to
the
brewery
to
pick
up
a
couple
at
the
end
of
the
season
reddishbrown
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
fruity
taste
is
dark
fruitssugar
cane
and
spices
there
is
some
kind
of
spice
floating
around
in
therenot
sure
what
it
is
but
its
good
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
i
would
purchase
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
some
belgian
candy
sugar
its
refreshingly
fruity
with
just
bit
of
tartness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
some
moderate
esters
there
is
a
hint
of
earthyroasted
character
as
well
as
a
bit
of
tart
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
it
seems
as
though
this
could
have
been
a
little
heavier
this
is
an
easy
drinking
belgian
beer
is
it
the
best
out
there
no
but
its
not
bad
and
its
a
hell
of
a
lot
cheaper
i
bought
a
few
cases
because
it
was
on
sale
i
liked
when
it
was
colder
but
now
that
its
warming
not
so
much
can
i
blame
them
not
so
much
but
even
when
it
was
cold
it
didnt
do
too
much
for
me
i
await
when
i
can
do
some
palate
expansion
and
talk
specifically
about
what
i
didntt
like
but
till
then
however
they
were
exceptionally
nice
at
the
brewery
where
i
bought
them
i
have
no
vested
interest
at
rh
but
locals
which
incl
me
who
talk
bad
should
visit
again
i
had
nothing
but
great
service
river
horse
has
been
like
a
new
brewery
as
of
late
making
nj
proud
but
this
isnt
a
favorite
of
the
bunch
cant
win
em
all
overall
this
was
past
its
expiration
date
which
may
have
negatively
affected
my
review
its
clearly
not
the
highest
quality
belgian
dark
but
still
quite
good
d
good
8
abv
cuts
down
on
drinknability
but
still
not
somethien
id
seek
out
a
nice
beer
but
not
for
me
some
adequate
carbonation
mediumbodied
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
good
effort
from
a
local
brewery
must
try
if
youre
in
the
area
or
can
acquire
it
some
other
way
d
not
very
drinkable
between
the
thin
mouthfeel
the
excessive
carbonation
and
the
flavors
that
scream
captain
morgan
tattoo
ill
be
staying
away
from
this
brew
definitely
wouldnt
drink
more
than
1
pours
a
dark
amber
chestnut
brown
color
with
ruby
edges
and
a
thin
head
that
quickly
fades
sweet
malty
aroma
with
subtle
spiciness
and
dark
fruit
nice
malty
character
with
dark
cherry
flavor
as
well
as
some
peppery
spice
hazelnu
and
some
other
dark
fruit
nicely
balanced
drinkability
not
really
that
high
kind
of
too
sweet
but
its
a
good
beer
overall
quite
tasty
but
a
bit
high
on
the
alc
8
so
thatll
limit
this
down
to
just
a
few
recommended
well
its
nothing
spectacular
i
know
on
here
it
says
abv
but
on
the
river
horse
website
it
lists
this
at
8
abv
you
can
definitely
detect
that
this
beer
doesnt
mask
the
alcohol
kick
at
all
but
being
a
winter
seasonal
i
dont
really
mind
that
there
is
a
definite
caramel
aroma
and
taste
but
i
have
a
feeling
this
isnt
too
belgian
in
the
way
it
tastes
not
too
bad
but
i
would
only
have
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
decent
beer
mediocre
appearance
no
head
light
lacing
notes
of
caramel
oak
dry
grain
with
a
sweet
finish
a
bit
of
raisins
come
out
of
the
balance
similiar
to
a
tame
american
strong
ale
that
doesnt
take
any
risks
this
ale
should
drop
the
belgian
run
around
and
identify
as
a
well
balanced
passive
winter
warmer
drinkability
not
too
sure
on
the
abv
of
this
one
but
it
probably
wont
be
for
everyone
i
enjoyed
it
simply
because
of
its
warming
characteristics
and
the
fact
that
malty
backbone
of
this
is
just
right
not
too
thick
yet
not
too
light
an
excellent
brew
to
drink
during
the
cold
months
drinkability
carbonation
aside
is
rather
good
if
they
tamed
the
head
down
this
would
be
a
great
beer
overall
not
too
bad
every
once
in
a
while
first
try
from
these
guys
and
this
one
shows
potential
glad
to
have
gotten
the
chance
to
try
this
one
very
good
taste
but
like
the
other
river
horse
beers
ive
sampled
seems
to
be
too
much
carbonation
huge
head
which
will
dissipate
but
like
a
bubbly
champagne
that
leaves
me
burping
all
night
and
leaves
that
gritty
feel
in
my
mouth
i
like
the
taste
would
it
kill
them
to
put
the
abv
on
ther
bottle
d
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
pints
of
this
no
problem
not
sure
what
the
alcohol
content
is
on
this
brew
though
this
could
get
me
in
trouble
d
spicy
cola
bitterness
and
alcohol
warmth
combines
with
a
fairly
smooth
character
making
for
an
easy
second
helping
winter
aleish
drink
worthy
of
a
six
pack
recommendation
this
deep
amber
brew
has
caramel
malt
infusion
light
hoppy
and
considerably
lower
sweetness
compared
to
most
belgian
ales
light
lacing
from
the
tap
nose
of
malt
makes
this
brew
an
enjoyable
treat
for
the
winter
months
we
were
right
at
the
brewery
for
this
tasting
so
this
is
fresh
as
fresh
can
be
pours
a
rich
maroon
color
with
a
light
offwhite
head
smell
is
mild
dark
toasty
malt
very
bland
overall
with
not
much
but
light
malt
and
bubbles
no
real
belgian
character
to
it
at
all
i
guess
it
does
hide
the
alcohol
very
well
but
this
was
incredibly
muted
flavorwise
mnot
sure
was
the
nae
is
belgian
i
noted
no
characteristics
of
a
belgian
ale
but
good
none
the
less
d
a
very
good
winter
beer
with
more
of
a
sweet
profile
rather
than
a
spice
bomb
12
oz
bottle
that
was
poured
into
a
victory
standard
pint
glass
this
river
horse
is
a
dark
amber
color
that
also
contained
a
small
tint
of
red
cranberry
it
had
a
minimal
head
of
foam
that
was
an
off
white
color
not
tan
but
not
not
white
either
this
head
of
foam
had
decent
retention
that
left
behind
foamy
rings
and
islands
of
bubbles
it
had
a
roasted
aroma
of
of
nuts
caramel
roasted
malts
subtle
milk
chocolate
and
some
sugar
plums
toward
the
back
the
taste
was
slightly
dry
and
roasted
with
roasted
malts
a
drop
of
milk
chocolate
a
few
coffee
beans
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
it
could
have
been
the
plums
that
were
in
the
aroma
trying
to
emerge
in
the
taste
but
werent
very
successful
and
then
the
taste
ended
with
crispy
roasted
citrus
hops
it
was
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
that
had
a
short
lived
aftertaste
of
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
sugar
plums
and
a
small
trace
of
citrus
hops
overall
a
decent
not
over
the
top
toasty
winter
beer
recommended
aftertaste
was
sour
with
hints
of
alcohol

my
favorite
from
this
brewery
a

bottle
from

labeled
as

freeze
winter
ale
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
orange
highlights
a
modest
head
tops
it
off
the
aroma
is
roasted

yeast
and
spicy
hops
medium
bodied
the
flavors
are
caramel
roasted
malt
burnt
sugar
and
a
tad
of
dark
ripe
fruit
a
slight
warming
from
the
alcohol
is
detectable
overall
not
too
bad
i
dont
know
about
belgianstyle
but
overall
i
dont
have
enough
going
on
its
just
a
bit
plain
for
an
8
belgian
not
bad
bitter
and
a
sour
yeasty
taste
just
not
as
bold
as
they
should
be
it
could
use
more
asskicking
character
flavor
knobs
turned
about
just
a
notch
or
two
more
with
not
much
carbonation
at
all
drinkability

53its
a
big
beer
that
fails
to
deliver
on
its
bigness
sure
maybe
due
to
my
perceptions
of
the
taste
cotton
candy
and
malts
caramelish
and
subtly
chocolatey
and
a
mild
note
of
chocolate
that
appears
in
the
finish
its
quite
nice
but
you
get
the
idea
of
what
they
were
after
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
its
not
right
up
my
alley
right
now
hell
sugary
raisin
and
understated
clove
dark
lovibond
caramel
malt
hints
tame
mixed
with
some
nutty
hints
very
spicy
notes
over
a
sweet
amber
malt
not
very
belgian
almost
like
a
classic
belgian
brown
should
smell
taste
is
mostly
of
roasted
malt
the
belgian
frostbite
is
fairly
solid
and
has
at
least
partially
restored
my
faith
in
river
horse
belgian
candy
sugar
it
possesses
a
very
attractive
color
which
produces
a
slick
mouthfeel
deep
amber
liquid
the
nose
has
a
vaguely
belgian
quality
to
it
along
with
roasted
malt
aromas
and
some
hop
spiciness
the
taste
is
quite
good
but
it
remained
for
a
while
some
light
lacing
was
formed
on
the
glass
during
the
drink
the
aroma
was
malty
with
some
hints
of
spice
the
flavor
was
strong
on
the
roasted
malts
and
yeast
the
spiciness
was
lighter
than
expected
for
a
winter
ale
the
body
was
slightly
thin
and
the
carbonation
was
light
tasty
o
tasty
brew
and
very
easy
drinking
fairly
expensive
for
the
abv
think
i
will
stick
to
more
belgian
strong
dark
ales
o
sweet
and
boozy
very
nice
would
have
again
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
bit
offwhite
head
and
loads
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
faint
notes
of
dark
fruit
plus
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
the

dry

overall
nice
session
beer
but
a
bit
too
flat
in
taste
d
on
the
whole
this
was
a
drinkable
beer
id
hardly
put
it
up
with
other
belgians
but
its
an
ok
beer
taste
was
not
exciting
as
i
was
expecting
indeed
i
was
expecting
much
from
this
trappist
i
am
nothing
that
in
love
with
the
achel
brune
8
but
as
for
the
petit
orval
this
seemed
to
me
as
a
little
sister
with
less
flavor
less
taste
and
less
mouthfeel
obviously
the
drinkability
is
at
higher
levels
thats
why
they
made
it
like
this
i
love
beer
especially
great
beer
but
even
with
all
that
i
can
pretty
much
drink
anything
i
left
34
of
this
pint
on
the
table
just
a
shear
chore
trying
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
glass
i
threw
in
the
towel
overall
great
beer
when
paired
with
steaks
frites
definitely
not
what
i
would
have
expected
from
a
dark
beer
o
awesome
brew
easily
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
o
the
taste
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
4
overall
im
not
quite
sure
i
would
put
this
beer
in
the
belgian
dark
ale
style
as
it
seems
more
like
a
porter
to
me
with
some
slight
belgian
influences
certainly
brewers
art
most
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
is
easily
sessionable
recommended
drinkability
belgian
porter
porter
belgian
dark
an
odd
hybrid
that
doesnt
seem
extremely
discernible
in
some
ways
but
its
lighter
which
would
probably
fit
the
bill
for
some
people
as
sessionable
since
its
also
pretty
dark
i
could
drink
more
than
one
but
id
prefer
more
flavor
overall
d
one
of
the
most
sessionable
beers
at
brewers
a
delicious
beer
whether
one
decides
to
classify
it
as
a
porter
or
a
belgian
dark
although
i
think
it
is
the
latter
d
i
had
one
glass
before
bolting
away
for
dinner
the
place
was
crowded
but
i
would
have
enjoyed
another
glass
or
two
there
is
no
way
in
hell
this
is
a
belgian
beer
its
a
standard
though
awful
american
stout

a
dark

flavor
is

sweet
smooth

has
a
full
carbonation
and
a
good
liquid
body
thick
but
still
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
even
though
its
heavier
out
of
all
the
beers
i
had
this
was
my
favorite
i
have
to
say
good
enough
to
go
back
for
seconds
drinkability
very
unusual
but
nicely
flavored
i
dont
know
why
everybody
here
is
getting
hung
up
with
whether
this
is
a
belgian
dark
or
a
porter
and
allowing
it
to
impact
their
ratings
the
brewpub
is
not
claiming
that
it
is
a
particular
style
as
far
as
i
can
see
and
many
of
brewers
art
beers
transcend
style
guidelines
and
thats
ok
with
me
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
with
decent
head
retention
and
very
good
lacing
i
have
to
say
i
get
almost
nothing
on
the
nose
just
some
light
sweet
malt
on
the
palate
one
gets
moderate
sweetness
with
a
noticeable
colarootbeer
flavor
the
beer
in
this
format
is
very
soft
and
plush
on
the
palate
with
the
relatively
low
abv
very
well
disguised
ultimately
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
delicious
nice
effort
from
ba
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
good
session
ale
d
quaffable
with
the
flavor
of
a
black
ale
not
too
sweet
light
in
body
and
sessionable
at
5
good
flavor
but
just
not
great
as
black
ales
go
i
cant
decide
how
to
treat
this
brew
now
that
i
see
its
a
belgian
it
seems
difficult
to
miss
the
mark
for
belgian
styles
dark
pale
strong
dark
strong
pale
but
i
wasnt
able
to
tell
this
guy
was
fermented
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
d
alright
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
over
bearing
after
a
while
due
to
the
potent
flavor
of
what
i
have
tasted
this
is
my
favorite
brewers
art
beer
for
sure
drinkability
interesting
beer
that
seems
to
straddle
style
differences
it
went
very
well
with
the
chocolate
cherry
bread
pudding
we
ordered
for
dessert
think
of
it
as
a
session
porter
for
a
belgian
dark
ale
this
is
dark
more
a
porter
or
stout
but
even
then
the
belgian
name
falls
short
the
yeast
they
used
really
fails
to
produce
those
typical
belgian
flavors
maybe
it
is
the
roasted
aspect
of
the
beer
but
even
that
is
very
bening
and
this
is
really
more
of
a
porteresque
thing
anyway
it
is
dark
a
hell
smells
clean
and
a
bit
roasty
the
taste
is
a
touch
yeast
and
porterish
nothing
special
here
but
it
still
makes
for
a
good
drink
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewers
art
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
good
two
fingers
of
coffe
colored
head
good
retention
and
excellent
lacing
nose
is
very
faint
a
light
roast
malt
and
bitter
chocolate
taste
is
a
nice
roasty
malt
with
flavors
of
coffee
vanilla
bitter
chocolate
and
a
slight
bitter
hop
aftertaste
medium
bodied
creamy
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
level
this
is
a
really
great
tasting
dark
ale
almost
like
a
porter
and
im
defintely
going
to
start
drinking
more
of
this
if
they
only
bottled
their
fine
creations
i
could
make
them
a
daily
session
beer
for
now
on
they
have
to
stay
as
a
1
75
happy
hour
favorite
unfortunately
the
dark
color
will
scare
off
most
of
the
proletarian
folks
in
this
town
saw
a
few
previous
comments
about
this
being
a
stout
im
fairly
sure
that
the
style
in
general
is
quite
different
depending
on
the
characteristics
of
the
individual
breweries
mildly
roasted
and
chocolatey
nose
with
some
earl
grey
nice
chocolatey
flavors
with
a
hint
of
roasted
black
patent
malt
a
legitmate
coffee
flavor
emerges
from
that
a
real
easy
drinker
thats
medium
bodied
with
just
enough
hops
to
lend
balance
herbal
and
plantlike
theyre
just
enough
a
good
effort
at
a
dark
session
beer
though
really
this
hardly
strikes
me
as
remotely
belgian
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
price
is
at
least
10
to
15
too
high
for
a
session
beer
as
it
is
priced
identical
to
their
triple
and
double
