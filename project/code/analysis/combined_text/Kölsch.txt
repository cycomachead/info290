for

as
advertised
the
verdict
average

take
on

a

goes

it
would
make
for

with

that
reminds
me
of
sourmashing
techniques
a
bit
of
a
lemony
flavor
pokes
through
but
it
isnt
quite
enough
to
save
this
one
for
me
the
dry
musty
notes
and
the
grainy
malts
really
run
the
show
and
it
is
too
much
i
like
my
kolsch
a
little
more
light
and
refreshing
maybe
a
bit
better
than
the
normal
summer
beer
although
this
was
slightly
different
very
very
similar
to
the
plznr
the
body
was
a
bit
too
full
for
the
style
and
was
also
sticky
drinkability
was
ok
you
could
drink
a
couple
at
a
cookout
or
any
situation
where
youre
not
focused
on
the
beer
overall
an
ok
brew
neither
terrible

great

can
do

a

take
on

wondered
if
this
was
the
trader
jose
with
lemon
bitter
and
metallic
wheat
character
at
times
you
get
what
you
pay
for
at
least
this
comes
in
at
a
decent
price
no
off
flavors
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
nice
head
of
white
on
top
that
faded
gently
into
a
thin
veil
that
left
the
top
bare
after
just
a
few
minutes
light
bready
notes
and
some
grains
in
the
smell
a
bit
light
for
me
without
that
top
notch
banana
aroma
you
would
see
in
a
really
good
version
of
the
style
smooth
mellow
flavor
albeit
light
even
and
well
balaned
with
a
light
bready
note
and
a
touch
of
light
grassy
notes
towards
the
end
smooth
and
easy
drinking
as
this
one
went
down
effortlessly
into
the
night
ok
summer
beer
just
a
little
off
tasting
with
citrus
out
of
balance
for
the
style
just
plain
not
good
would
definitely
not
buy
again
and
i
really
like
good
kolschs
but
this
isnt
it
nor
is
this
a
good
summer
brew
it
just
falls
flat
and
has
some
odd
flavors
that
are
flat
out
unpleasant
which
is
too
bad
the
overall
score
bump
is
an
evaluation
of
value
because
thats
got
to
count
for
something
but
still
man
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
puffy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
small
spots
and
broken
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
somewhat
lacking
but
what
i
do
get
is
grains
and
light
fruits
taste
is
surprisingly
bitter
right
off
the
bat
with
a
breadybiscuit
flavor
and
some
citrus
zest
on
the
finish
the
bitterness
is
somewhat
assertive
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
an
average
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
carbonation
level
and
a
crisp
flavor
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
and
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
too
much
to
be
a
truly
enjoyable
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
taste
is
good
a
nice
full
grain
with
light
fruity
sweetness
some
apple
and
lightly
bitter
grass
and
pepper
simple
but
solid
firm
with
good
depth
and
balance
a
nice
full
feel
its
not
very
good
but
its
a
decent
kolsch
best
by
date
is
12212
new
and
rather
attractive
label
it
is
a
very
average
beer
the
aroma
is
pleasant
having
strong
malty
tones
with
some
fruity
esters
from
the
hops
there
is
a
lot
of
white
head
and
foam
and
it
is
over
carbonated
the
taste
is
grassy
with
a
mild
citrus
finish
the
body
is
thin
and
has
some
bite
overall
its
ok
i
didnt
know
the
style
it
was
when
i
bought
it
it
just
looked
nice
at
the
trader
joes
and
a
summer
beer
sounded
good
i
would
say
it
is
good
for
warmer
weather
but
the
style
itself
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
very
much
like
a
macrolager
but
not
as
grainy
final
thought
5
abv
5
a
sixer
and
refreshing
not
bad
d
goes
down
easy
on
a
hot
day
but
very
average
for
style
this
beer
produced
a
thin
white
head
it
had
below
average
head
retention
zero
amount
of
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
was
yeasty
and
slightly
hoppy
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
bready
with
some
banana
like
yeast
flavor
light
in
body
very
drinkable
good
beer
for
a
summer
day
this
beer
finishes
very
dry
leading
me
to
empty
this
glass
very
quickly
as
far
as
kolsch
goes
this
is
average
it
will
do
the
trick
on
a
hot
day
t
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
high
for
me
and
the
body
is
a
little
too
heavy
for
this
to
be
a
good
summer
beer
its
just
not
refreshing
some
honey
upfront
followed
by
a
hint
of
stale
hops
and
maybe
a
touch
of
aspirin
towards
the
finish
the
middle
has
some
orange
in
it
as
well
its
not
the
worst
of
the
trader
joes
lineup
see
kennebunkport
wheat
but
its
not
really
worth
picking
up
overall
very
drinkable
beer
i
have
book
knowledge
about
kolsch
beers
but
not
having
been
to
germany
havent
had
an
authetic
one
ive
had
hales
and
enjoyed
it
but
thats
about
it
that
said
id
be
ok
with
this
in
my
fridge
for
friends
coming
over
during
warm
weather
you
can
put
it
on
the
board
yes
definitely
in
a
good
mood
after
home
run
number
two
this
ones
carlos
quentins
makes
the
score
60
chisox
in
the
third
time
for
a
kolsch
this
one
pours
a
lightly
hazy
grapefruit
yellow
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
dusty
orange
dry
wheat
and
plenty
o
butter
hm
the
taste
isnt
really
more
heartening
with
notes
of
funky
wheat
sour
mandarin
orange
and
straight
dust
a
light
but
still
very
obvious
bitterness
gums
not
enough
tooth
to
bite
the
tongue
a
bit
at
the
end
the
body
is
a
heftyfeeling
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
sad
kolsch
straight
up
kolcsh
styles
arent
supposed
to
be
heavy
or
extremely
flavorful
but
i
felt
that
this
was
far
too
light
even
for
the
a
kolsch
style
beer
the
color
was
a
very
clear
yellow
not
too
much
happening
in
here
the
beer
is
for
sure
a
summer
time
brew
this
wouldnt
really
fit
well
in
the
colder
months
bought
this
because
this
summer
brew
was
being
sold
at
a
closeout
price
3
99
for
a
6er
during
this
brutal
winter
here
in
the
hudson
valley
i
cant
speak
to
how
faithfully
it
represents
the
true
kolsch
style
but
while
it
is
highly
drinkable
it
has
almost
no
character
i
e
anything
that
makes
it
memorable
accordingly
it
reminds
me
of
the
kind
of
beer
you
have
after
a
couple
of
good
ones
that
is
when
your
palate
is
not
so
discriminating
and
you
just
want
to
keep
the
buzz
on
not
that
i
ever
do
that
heaven
knows
im
just
saying
anyway
i
think
their
strategy
worked
because
i
was
at
tjs
today
and
there
was
none
to
be
had
12
oz
bottle
from
traders
joe
pours
golden
with
a
lasting
foamy
white
head
and
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
grassy
hops
some
biscuit
malt
and
lemon
taste
is
similar
but
more
balanced
slight
off
sour
notes
medium
slightly
crisp
body
medium
dry
finish
not
bad
i
put
appearance
at
the
end
because
the
first
two
i
had
were
out
of
the
bottle
and
having
poured
the
third
i
think
it
might
actually
taste
better
in
the
bottle
a
kolsch
other
members
say
no
a
drinkable
beer
yes
accept
it
as
a
summer
seasonal
more
than
a
kolsch
and
enjoy
it
and
get
them
cheap
now
october
before
they
are
gone
drinkability
very
sessionable
but
kolschs
should
be
its
not
a
great
kolsch
a
great
tasting
beer
half
the
price
of
blue
moon
and
just
about
as
tasty
only
problem
is
that
it
is
not
a
belgium
wit
but
a
kolsch
i
hope
that
they
will
revisit
their
brewing
technique
on
this
one
and
improve
it
for
next
year
another
good
bargain
beer
from
trader
joes
d
low
abv
makes
this
a
good
session
beer
but
it
is
a
little
corny
for
my
taste
overall
mix
of
flavors
are
not
bad
just
not
by
cup
of
tea
drinkability
a
pretty
bland
beer
overall
but
it
only
cost
me
20
cents
so
im
not
complaining
this
would
make
a
good
refresher
and
at
the
price
i
got
it
for
its
still
worth
it
if
you
can
get
it
that
cheap
its
at
least
worth
the
tasting
poured
golden
yellow
with
lager
clarity
small
head
that
falls
quickly
smell
is
rather
unappealing
like
wet
dog
and
cooked
vegetables
taste
is
also
a
little
strange
an
upfront
lime
flavor
that
seems
out
of
place
with
a
small
grassy
hop
profile
flavor
and
aroma
did
begin
to
improve
as
the
brew
warmed
up
has
a
mild
dry
bitterness
in
the
back
end
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
not
something
i
would
want
another
of
since
i
had
trouble
finishing
one
in
short
a
subpar
attempt
at
a
great
style
for
6
a
6pack
ill
take
this
to
the
pool
or
beach
over
your
average
macro
lager
any
day
not
the
most
exciting
beer
in
the
world
nor
is
it
a
great
example
of
the
style
seems
to
be
more
of
a
pils
but
its
an
inexpensive
summer
beer
and
in
this
nc
heat
its
pretty
satisfying
taste
was
very
mellow
as
the
slight
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
roastiness
of
the
malts
allowing
a
hint
of
caramell
sweetness
very
pleasing
to
the
palate
as
its
not
to
heavy
small
price
makes
this
brew
style
very
drinkable
here
in
the
110
degree
weather
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
are
pretty
subdued
but
are
good
a
lemony
hoppiness
with
faintly
honeyish
maltiness
these
same
notes
come
through
on
the
palate
where
the
flavors
are
also
subdued
but
are
very
natural
tasting
and
wellbalanced
its
nothing
special
but
its
a
fine
representative
of
the
kolsch
style
a
nice
choice
for
sweltering
weather
overall
a
smooth
fairly
clean
summer
beer
perfect
for
the
barbeque
d
this
is
ok
but
not
as
good
as
the
real
german
kolsch
value
b
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
is
smooth
enough
though
the
flavor
of
the
malt
gets
old
quickly
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
probably
wouldnt
because
it
is
kind
of
boring
beer
i
would
definately
recommend
this
to
my
bmc
drinking
compadres
i
see
it
as
a
pretty
good
gateway
beer
out
of
macroland
its
not
a
bad
beer
the
price
on
it
was
good
and
thinking
of
it
as
a
grasscutter
brew
i
probably
have
it
again
drinkability
had
to
try
now
that
my
tjs
is
selling
single
bottles
rather
than
whole
six
packs
not
disappointed
but
not
impressed
just
another
beer
i
do
enjoy
the
carbonation
and
dry
after
taste
i
find
myself
looking
forward
to
the
next
sip
overall
it
has
a
decent
drinkability
but
would
probably
pass
on
this
if
browsing
the
trader
joes
beer
section
unless
i
wanted
to
get
a
decent
beer
for
some
brc
drinking
friends
for
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
darker
than
normal
copper
color
with
a
smallish
head
on
top
surprising
amount
of
fruit
in
the
nose
mixed
along
with
the
tobeexpected
grain
and
malt
not
sure
what
fruit
exactly
maybe
some
apricot
or
citrus
taste
is
similar
stronger
than
expected
although
not
really
particularly
good
sort
of
a
dirtiness
that
comes
along
with
the
toostrong
carbonation
overall
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
one
id
go
back
to
quickly
too
carbonated
not
good
but
not
horrible
i
cant
believe
people
traded
a
firestone
10
for
this
one
this
is
a
pretty
bland
inoffensive
but
not
terribly
interesting
beer
its
cheap
which
is
nice
overall
a
plain
ale
with
a
predominantly
macro
feel
d
i
scored
the
drinkability
high
because
i
could
see
myself
grabbing
it
again
and
again
on
a
summer
day
its
light
and
tasty
drinkability
all
around
above
average
for
me
but
nothing
more
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
though
it
does
lack
a
lot
of
flavor
maybe
ive
just
never
had
a
great
version
of
the
style
because
i
find
many
of
them
this
way
a
step
above
a
bmc
brew
for
a
solid
lawnmowing
beer
ok
but
i
had
far
worst
beers
its
a
good
beer
thats
worth
a
try
just
not
what
i
expected
the
overall
impressions
section
at
bjcp
on
this
beer
states
to
the
untrained
taster
easily
mistaken
for
a
light
lager
a
somewhat
subtle
pilsner
or
perhaps
a
blonde
ale
and
i
thought
exactly
that
on
the
pils
side
though
ive
had
others
of
the
style
that
tend
toward
a
little
more
character
a
very
drinkable
beer
particularly
if
you
like
hops
not
the
lightest
tasting
kolschstyle
beer
and
much
more
reminiscent
of
a
german
pils
more
drinkable
than
say
a
budweiser
this
has
a
bit
more
flavor
no
a
great
beer
but
good
for
its
stated
purpose
of
summer
brew
note
sorry
i
got
the
name
a
bit
wrong
it
should
be
josephsbrau
summer
brew
like
their
other
trader
joes
contract
beers
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
as
i
generally
love
cl
however
this
was
just
an
ok
kolsch
comes
to
the
table
in
a
tall
cylinder
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
bubbly
white
head
sweet
bready
pilsner
malt
with
spicy
floral
hops
to
balance
sweet
bready
flavor
nice
crisp
hop
bite
great
little
beer
overall
good
summer
beer
no
need
to
rush
out
and
buy
more
right
away
nor
does
it
being
me
back
to
several
fun
nights
i
spent
in
cologne
germany
drinking
kolsch
but
a
nice
beer
my
pour
netted
me
a
brief
fizzy
finger
of
bonewhite
head
that
faded
like
anything
colored
red
when
exposed
to
bright
unrelenting
sunlight
color
was
a
light
lemonyellow
srm
2
4
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
malty
quality
not
very
hoppy
despite
what
they
said
on
the
label
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
very
light
almost
like
lemonlime
soda
pop
lemony
slightly
grassy
very
dry
and
refreshing
they
were
right
on
the
money
in
terms
of
the
style
and
i
think
that
i
would
enjoy
it
much
more
on
a
hot
humid
summers
day
than
a
cold
dry
winters
one
the
finish
was
equally
light
and
crisp
and
i
would
be
reaching
for
another
except
that
i
only
had
one
o
great
example
of
the
style
really
glad
i
got
this
in
a
trade
because
it
would
have
been
easy
to
overlook
otherwise
but
a
tasty
treat
indeed
overall
really
well
done
and
very
refreshing
i
havent
had
many
beers
from
this
brewer
but
i
will
search
some
out
based
on
this
brew
reminds
me
a
bit
of
prima
pils
by
victory
overall
perfect
for
one
of
the
last
warm
days
of
summer
light
beer
yet
still
full
flavored
with
great
yeast
action
worth
a
go
onice
for
this
style
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
o
an
excellent
kolsch
makes
me
want
to
brew
one
disappointing
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
much
but
the
dms
is
too
much
poured
into
stange
pale
yellow
and
fizzy
clear
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
fades
into
nothing
pretty
quickly
smell
is
crisp
and
clean
malty
and
dry
with
slight
winelike
scents
taste
is
light
and
crisp
slightly
dry
with
some
few
grassy
and
piney
hops
at
the
end
giving
a
refreshing
finish
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
a
bit
dry
this
beer
has
almost
no
nose
the
malt
is
but
a
sweetness
in
the
breath
of
it
it
catches
the
light
aflame
because
of
its
haze
the
crown
is
white
only
a
shy
depth
from
the
grain
will
come
to
the
nose
taste
is
breaddy
a
slight
bitterness
and
only
a
whisper
of
herbal
from
hops
very
dry
crisp
you
can
barely
perceive
a
fruity
lightness
from
the
grain
because
the
malt
is
crisp
and
dramatic
in
the
finish
it
gives
a
slight
pucker
poured
clear
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
all
of
which
are
common
to
this
style
light
malty
smell
that
mixed
with
a
very
light
fruit
undertone
taste
was
good
a
little
malty
for
this
style
but
still
good
overall
a
good
beer
for
a
summer
day
pours
a
light
clear
gold
with
a
thick
foamy
head
you
can
smell
some
wheat
notes
but
nothing
thick
everything
about
this
screams
clean
and
it
pays
off
when
you
raise
the
glass
to
taste
it
its
fairly
lightbodied
maybe
heavy
for
style
but
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
its
fairly
nimble
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
that
really
would
pair
amazingly
well
with
classic
german
foods
like
a
brat
with
sauerkraut
in
fact
why
the
hell
am
i
not
eating
that
right
now
damnit
light
and
airy
head
of
a
bit
over
one
finger
bone
white
mainly
small
to
medium
sized
bubbles
dissolves
away
swiftly
to
a
patchy
surface
coating
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
perfectly
clear
liquid
bright
yellow
consistently
hued
throughout
loosely
strewn
bubbles
of
good
fatness
slowly
bubble
upwards
the
nose
is
full
of
hard
country
bread
crust
salted
pretzels
quinine
minerals
and
cut
grass
but
on
the
other
hand
banana
bubblegum
and
sour
orange
to
lemon
citrus
honey
nothing
floral
nor
broadly
fruity
about
it
ends
on
a
pepper
and
salt
note
its
mediumbodied
with
a
creamy
entry
which
slowly
stiffens
into
a
firmer
presentation
of
bread
grains
corn
muffins
and
biscuits
and
more
of
that
mineral
water
saline
stuff
more
floral
and
added
peach
apricot
fruit
the
syrupy
texture
helps
the
sweetness
persist
maybe
a
pinch
of
cocoa
its
satisfying
more
in
a
warm
your
belly
way
than
refresh
you
after
mowing
the
lawn
way
as
with
many
seems
like
it
wants
to
please
too
many
disparate
expectations
and
thus
suffers
from
lack
of
clear
purpose
but
no
problem
throwing
back
a
couple
its
got
some
very
impressive
qualities
for
a
kolsch
but
the
taste
is
fleeting
and
only
on
the
finish
it
doesnt
really
fill
the
mouth
either
unlike
most
great
kolschs
ive
had
its
still
a
very
solid
easy
drinking
go
to
kolsch
for
sure
but
i
wont
be
knocking
down
barriers
to
get
at
it
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
now
this
does
strike
me
as
a
kölsch
which
is
an
underrepresented
style
in
the
us
its
a
bit
thicker
than
its
german
counterparts
though
thats
fine
though
it
still
touches
on
the
flavors
that
it
should
easy
to
drink
though
if
i
was
going
to
improve
it
id
say
thin
out
the
flavors
a
bit
disclaimer
i
love
the
liquid
gold
no
disrespect
to
captain
lawrence
overall
light
body
and
flavor
but
in
a
good
way
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
o
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
thatll
quench
your
thirst
on
hot
day
while
bring
more
flavor
that
light
lager
id
enjoy
this
liberally
at
a
summer
cookout
or
with
a
hotdog
at
a
ball
game
myself
definitely
a
hybrid
with
one
foot
in
the
lager
category
and
the
other
in
the
ale
pours
a
clear
light
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
some
retention
and
a
good
lace
aroma
is
of
grainy
malts
and
grassy
hops
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
sweet
and
honey
like
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
very
nice
version
of
this
style
o
what
a
home
run
of
an
everyday
beer
this
is
the
best
kolsch
i
have
ever
had
this
might
be
my
new
lawn
mower
beer
for
the
summertime
but
wow
this
could
become
a
simple
go
to
beer
when
im
at
the
store
keep
it
coming
vacarro
o
id
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
beer
easier
to
drink
than
this
pleasant
and
refreshing
i
will
be
revisiting
this
during
the
summer
t
overall
solid
and
refreshing
finish
is
a
bit
bland
overall
super
clean
excellent
hoppy
finish
perhaps
my
second
favorite
kolsch
only
behind
new
hollands
this
is
one
i
could
drink
all
day
easily
a
top
3
kolsch
in
my
book
great
intro
to
captain
lawrence
a
very
tasty
kolsch
that
went
very
well
with
dinner
mediumlight
bodied
nice
carbonation
excellent
crispness
and
refreshing
qualities
a
strong
traditional
take
on
the
kolsch
style
its
a
kolsch
not

light
beers
like
this
just
arent
my
thing
once
in
a
while
i
find
one
that
is
pretty
good
but
this
really
wasnt
too
memorable
the
kolsch
style
doesnt
demand
much
yet
it
is
rarely
done
well
cl
manages
to
hit
the
mark
clear
gold
with
a
pure
white
head
light
grainy
balanced
cereal
flavor
with
a
clean
lemon
thyme
hop
note
lightly
yeasty
flavor
like
the
aroma
of
sourdough
starter
clean
and
dry
it
wont
hold
your
interest
but
its
a
nice
beer
to
start
the
night
with
i
used
to
refuse
drinking
kolsch
style
beers
but
this
is
definitely
an
eye
opener
that
the
style
has
its
ups
apparently
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
kolsch
like
many
other
of
cl
belgianeuropean
style
offerings
there
yeast
strain
is
extraordinarily
phenolic
and
dominant
and
makes
the
beer
unbalanced
and
just
tastes
generically
belgian
and
yeasty
pours
clear
golden
color
with
14
inch
fluffy
white
foam
citrussy
beer
smell

nice

overall
a

tasty
and

kölsch
ill
definitely
have
this
again
given
the
opportunity
toasted
bread
malts
up
front
peppery
spicy
hop
bitterness
comes
on
soon
enough
though
bready
malt
becomes
sweeter
with
notes
of
apple
and
honey
hints
of
coriander
and
maybe
citrus
lemongrass
herbal
peppery
hops
take
it
to
the
finish
which
is
oh
so
dry
and
refreshing
lingering
sea
air
hops
and
peppercorns
moderate
body
with
a
lively
refreshing
feel
a
great
summer
quencher
and
a
nice
hoppy
twist
on
an
underappreciated
style
overall
par
for
the
course
with
captain
lawrence
lots
of
flavor
really
well
balanced
awesome
hot
weather
beer
as
well
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
its
crisp
and
clean
and
more
complex
than
other
beers
ive
had
in
the
style
which
is
admittedly
few
will
buy
again
overall
i
had
the
liquid
gold
yet
to
try
but
this
was
way
better
than
that
dipa
they
made
great
flavors
and
easy
on
the
palate
o
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
blown
away
by
this
one
but
i
kind
of
was
extremely
delicious
hot
weather
beer
full
of
flavor
im
a
noob
to
the
kolsch
style
but
this
is
a
winner
in
my
book
so
glad
to
have
this
in
six
pack
format
cool
crisp
bite
to
this
carbonation
level
uplifts
this
light
beer
making
this
one
quite
zippy
and
refreshing
great
flavor
profile
of
mild
bittering
hops
grass
fresh
bread
all
melded
together
beautifully
this
beer
really
hit
the
spot
were
this
a
local
offering
id
have
a
sixer
of
this
on
hand
most
anytime
during
these
warm
months
cheers
todd
thanks
for
the
hookup
oa
great
kolsch
a
beer
style
ive
never
bond
fond
of
until
this
one
o
a
fantastic
summer
beer
probably
going
to
drink
many
more
of
these
this
summer
im
happy
these
guys
are
basically
in
my
backyard
not
a
very
thrilling
drinking
experience
as
the
color
is
disappointingly
pale
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
foamy
odthe
kolsch
style
is
great
for
the
warm
weather
this
beer
is
light
but
it
is
complex
and
a
nice
sip
i
found
this
to
be
a
solid
beer
i
love
the
company
this
is
a
great
summer
brew
wont
blow
you
away
but
miles
away
from
subpar
the
mouthful
was
full
and
smooth
with
a
small
but
enjoyable
aftertaste
o
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
beer
easily
sessionable
more
great
work
by
captain
lawrence
cheers
o
overall
pretty
good
for
a
style
that
i
dont
always
love
this
one
was
very
easy
too
drink
well
done
by
the
captain
very
good
light
summer
brew
light
dry
malt
with
a
good
dose
of
grassy
hops
i
could
easily
throw
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
having
said
that
i
remember
this
being
a
little
better
in
the
tap
room
still
a
solid
american
take
on
the
style
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
taste
is
fruity
a
bit
of
hops
bread
like
malty
finish
i
havent
had
many
kolsch
brews
except
in
germany
and
those
were
a
bit
more
malty
and
bitter
so
its
hard
to
compare
the
style
but
this
is
fantastic
i
love
a
nice
brew
from
cl
and
this
did
not
disappoint
at
all
in
fact
its
fantastic
the
beer
arrives
essentially
clear
with
a
golden
hue
and
a
few
centimeters
white
foam
the
aroma
is
of
lightly
toasted
malt
with
lots
of
bread
and
some
huskiness
this
continues
on
to
the
palate
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
smooth
as
it
roils
across
a
vague
fruitiness
emerges
as
the
beer
warms
this
beer
is
perhaps
not
as
clean
as
a
kolsch
should
be
but
still
plenty
enjoyable
mouthfeel
was
very
light
a
crisp
with
a
light
body
a
light
thin
and
almost
watery
feel
and
a
refreshing
overall
experience
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
tasty
and
a
fine
session
beer
that
is
on
par
for
this
style
with
much
better
than
average
flavor
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
this
light
and
easy
drinking
style
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
while
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
thought
this
one
stood
out
a
little
more
to
me
than
others
i
have
had
in
the
past
i
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
a
marvelous
beer
highly
recommended
i
guess
those
who
like
this
style
in
southeastsouthwestnorthwest
parts
of
country
will
need
to
trade
for
a
growler
i
was
in
line
at
the
cl
brewery
buying
a
growler
of
their
pale
ale
and
wondered
out
loud
what
my
second
growler
should
be
a
guy
there
for
free
samples
recommended
the
kolsch
its
not
usually
my
style
but
i
had
a
sample
myself
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
a
bit
sweet
to
start
but
somehow
finishes
dry
and
refrshing
a
neat
trick
that
i
have
no
idea
how
the
brewmaster
accomplishes
but
it
works
i
do
still
prefer
cls
hoppier
recipes
but
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
as
one
of
those
that
makes
you
think
this
must
be
what
real
beer
used
to
taste
like
md
as
expected
ligh
mouth
excelllent
drinkability
kolschs
are
the
shit
and
this
is
an
excellent
example
my
first
try
of
the
style
so
cant
make
a
comparison
but
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
had
it
on
a
cold
rainy
what
should
have
been
spring
day
and
it
made
me
think
of
sand
sun
and
summer
poured
beautifully
with
a
nice
thick
foamy
white
head
clean
smelling
coming
across
like
beer
kinda
pure
taste
was
sweet
and
crisp
and
very
very
drinkable
at
5
5
the
presence
of
alcohol
was
almost
non
existent
and
after
two
10
oz
glasses
i
felt
like
i
could
drink
a
whole
bunch
more
i
didnt
however
i
saved
it
for
after
dinner
ill
be
revisiting
this
plenty
over
the
coming
months
overall
im
really
digging
kolsch
and
im
going
to
have
to
keep
making
an
effort
to
find
it
im
definitely
going
to
be
brewing
a
kolsch
for
this
summer
i
am
starting
to
think
that
kolsch
doesnt
get
the
respect
it
deserves
from
beer
geeks
captain
lawrence
always
does
a
good
job
brewing
and
this
is
no
exception
certainly
worth
a
try
cheers
beer
is
thin
and
watery
the
finish
of
the
beer
is
oddly
bitter
out
of
place
there
is
no
effort
to
connect
the
pilsen
malt
with
the
hop
presence
in
the
beer
and
it
falls
apart
in
my
opinion
there
are
much
much
better
kolsches
out
there
skip
this
one
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
its
a
lot
more
flavorful
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
pretty
good
white
head
decent
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
forward
some
light
grain
and
very
faint
hops
but
also
brings
forward
an
unfortunate
dms
presence
that
is
reminiscent
of
creamed
corn
and
a
bit
of
soaked
cabbage
luckily
it
wasnt
terribly
overwhelming
the
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
and
its
tough
to
get
past
though
there
are
some
nice
element
sin
the
background
feel
is
light
and
fairly
crisp
other
than
the
dms
issue
a
really
drinkable
brew
the
beer
appears
transparent
and
light
yellow
in
color
the
white
head
is
a
quarter
inch
thick
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
mild
citrus
and
lightly
toasted
bread
the
beer
is
fairly
well
balanced
and
light
on
the
palate
the
flavor
has
a
subtle
oddness
about
it
reminiscent
of
overcooked
vegetables
this
is
masked
to
some
degree
by
the
more
pleasant
flavors
the
beer
has
to
offer
this
would
be
a
decent
warm
weather
beer
a
friend
who
i
introduced
to
this
beer
described
it
as
bottled
joy
md
light
to
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
that
keeps
it
crisp
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
very
refreshing
a
great
beer
to
kick
back
with
on
a
hot
day
or
a
rainy
evening
with
a
burger
as
i
did
drinkability
overall
pretty
refreshing
though
im
curious
as
to
whether
the
tinge
of
funky
tartness
was
intentional
a
defect
or
caused
by
poor
growler
maintenance
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
nice
mix
of
flavors
a
bit
darker
for
a
kolsch
but
it
was
still
tastey
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
on
the
east
coast
and
one
of
the
best
kölsch
stylings
brewed
outside
of
germany
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
from
captain
lawrence
would
give
another
shot
orange
yellow
in
color
carbonated
and
bubbly
on
tap
at
the
applebees
near
captain
lawrence
cdc
eve
it
very
nice
to
see
this
here
smell
is
full
of
light
wheat
and
fruit
orange
and
lemon
predominantly
but
not
much
going
on
overall
taste
has
a
phenolic
alcohol
quality
to
it
up
front
with
orange
lemon
and
what
at
the
back
and
a
pepperiness
as
it
finishes
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
i
had
a
couple
and
would
have
many
more
given
the
chance
i
cant
believe
how
long
it
took
me
to
try
this
beer
captain
lawrence
is
local
and
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
kolsch
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
liked
this
a
lot
didnt
love
it
but
i
defiinitely
liked
it
typical
of
kolsch
it
was
light
in
color
and
a
bit
cloudy
great
aroma
good
flavor
and
a
great
mix
of
malt
and
hops
ill
have
it
again
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
sharing
poured
a
translucent
orangegold
with
a
quarter
inch
loose
white
head
nose
is
herbal
something
of
a
minty
character
and
a
bit
of
citrus
taste
follows
nose
herbal
quality
is
a
bit
more
muted
and
some
biscuity
notes
come
out
in
the
middle
with
the
herbal
quality
coming
out
again
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
an
easy
carbonation
all
and
all
a
very
light
easy
drinking
flavorful
and
refreshing
slightly
offcenter
for
the
style
but
quite
quaffable
and
tasty
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
kolsch
before
i
had
to
consult
ba
to
see
if
kolsches
were
lagers
or
ales
as
mentioned
above
this
beer
had
alot
of
lager
properties
but
the
fruitiness
and
the
bigger
mouthfeel
made
this
very
enjoyable
another
great
beer
by
cl
thanks
sis
d
what
a
surprise
another
solid
brew
from
cl
i
have
really
embraced
the
sessionable
beers
lately
this
is
a
solid
yet
interesting
off
from
cl
nothing
extreme
or
high
hops
or
abv
just
a
tastey
brew
try
it
the
beer
is
nicely
sweet
with
basically
no
notable
hops
present
very
easy
to
drink
another
pleasant
captain
lawrence
brew
that
makes
me
glad
i
have
a
regular
growler
connection
in
the
area
d
great
for
the
style
nice
to
finally
have
a
kolsch
worth
drinking
more
than
once
pairs
nice
with
some
lighter
cuisine
salad
and
chicken
this
to
me
embodies
the
german
spirit
of
brewing
keep
it
clean
but
pack
it
with
plenty
of
flavor
this
tastes
conditioned
and
fresh
at
the
same
time
great
work
yet
again
from
the
captain
aka
scott
vaccaro
this
guy
is
a
real
blessing
to
the
nyc
area
beer
crowd
overall
my
perfect
idea
of
a
subtle
flavorful
yet
easydrinking
summer
beer
cheers
very
drinkable
extremely
light
pleasant
mouthfeel
perfect
for
an
afternoon
by
the
pool
overall
a
very
tasty
kolsch
overall
very
very
good
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
with
the
summer
heat
coming
up
one
can
only
hope
that
this
one
becomes
a
staple
having
said
that
i
still
will
get
growlers
of
this
regularly
to
enjoy
as
the
weather
warms
up
a
bit
more
another
hit
for
the
captain
and
i
think
that
this
beer
will
help
a
lot
of
beer
novices
open
up
to
some
of
their
more
obscure
or
aggressive
styles
d
unlike
drseamus
i
waited
till
it
was
80
out
to
crack
this
this
was
supposed
to
be
my
yankees
red
sox
2010
opener
beer
but
it
was
too
nice
out
not
to
drink
this
i
really
loved
this
beer
this
is
a
solid
yet
boring
hit
from
captain
lawrence
something
i
would
get
a
keg
of
during
the
summer
if
my
better
half
did
not
hate
the
style
more
on
tap
in
the
summer
outdoors
please
d
joe
you
were
right
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
this
growler
arrived
just
in
time
for
me
to
sit
on
my
balcony
and
enjoy
temps
in
the
70s
in
march
in
chicago
brilliant
mini
growler
fill
from
deciccos
in
ardsley
ny
new
beer
from
the
good
captain
is
always
an
treat
and
this
journey
to
a
new
style
is
an
interesting
move
guess
it
makes
sense
for
springsummer
anyway
this
one
pours
moderatly
hazed
yellowish
amber
under
an
off
white
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
nice
amounts
of
light
sheetinglace
lightdelicate
nose
of
straw
and
lemon
citrusy
light
and
refreshing
brew
more
lemon
light
grassy
and
refreshing
brew
i
cant
say
i
am
real
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
seemingly
well
balanced
and
highly
sessionable
bring
on
springsummer
and
lighter
beers
like
this
one
d
why
the
hell
would
they
release
a
goddamned
kolsch
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
this
is
a
summer
beer
scott
the
rosso
release
was
brutal
and
nothing
goes
better
with
brutal
cold
than
a
kolsch
no
wait
i
meant
any
other
beer
besides
a
kolsch
ill
be
generous
and
grade
it
as
if
it
was
a
nice
hot
day
outside
kaptains
kolsch
is
kolschy
looking
with
a
bright
deep
yellow
with
some
gold
trimmings
squeezed
in
for
some
slightly
darker
colors
a
nice
billowy
white
head
scattered
lace
smells
of
grain
hay
earthy
hops
lemons
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
but
maybe
not
in
that
order
the
feel
is
light
with
lively
carb
and
clean
as
a
babys
i
would
and
will
get
this
again
easy
drinking
low
abv
and
taste
not
as
good
as
my
go
to
kolsch
yellowtail
but
this
hits
the
marks
drinkability
is
first
rate
refreshing
and
quite
the
quaffer
this
is
a
top
notch
session
beer
and
one
i
hope
to
see
at
the
captain
often
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
but
has
more
substance
than
the
color
suggests
a
refreshing
level
of
carbonation
and
the
general
simple
character
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
really
started
to
grow
on
me
by
the
second
glass
i
would
get
this
again
the
body
was
fuller
than
i
prefer
for
the
style
and
was
a
bit
sticky
it
was
very
smooth
and
even
though
drinkability
was
decent
although
i
couldnt
see
drinking
2
in
a
row
overall
a
nice
enough
brew
nothing
particularly
outstanding
but
solid
enough
to
try
if
you
see
it
rogue
farms
honey
kolsch
brewed
by
rogue
ales
with
an
abv
of
5
90
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
sweetness
you
also
pick
up
on
some
grains
and
malts
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
like
honey
with
some
nice
grains
and
malts
the
taste
is
light
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
but
light
rogue
ales
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
rogue
farms
honey
kolsch
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
this
brew
is
real
nice
and
crisp
you
really
dont
pick
up
on
the
5
9
abv
i
like
how
this
brew
is
different
from
most
brews
on
the
market
overall
im
giving
rogue
farms
honey
kolsch
4
25
out
of
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
88

great
something
has
to
be
said
for
breweries
that
pay
attention
to
every
little
detail
going
into
their
beer
in
this
genre
quality
is
everything
to
that
end
the
honey
kolsch
was
impressive
the
honey
complimented
the
malts
and
yeast
to
create
an
extremely
easy
to
drink
beer
that
would
find
a
home
in
my
fridge
in
the
spring
and
summer
there
was
little
to
no
sting
in
terms
of
taste
but
an
additional
strong
ingredient
would
have
really
pushed
this
over
the
top
ive
had
a
few
rogue
farms
products
and
this
one
just
doesnt
compare
in
taste
rather
dull
lacks
in
flavor
and
taste
bottle
look
pretty
though
with
such
packaging
i
was
really
expecting
to
taste
something
special
i
read
the
narrative
of
the
process
and
ingredients
but
sorry
boys
you
better
take
a
trip
to
germany
to
learn
how
its
done
this
is
no
better
than
my
own
attempt
at
home
brew
drinkable
but
just
the
taste
begins
with
a
nice
malt
flavor
and
mild
yeast
with
gentle
honey
sweetness
and
slightly
creamy
taste
with
toast
elements
from
the
malt
which
supports
the
honey
flavor
and
there
is
a
light
hop
taste
that
hints
at
green
tea
with
a
herbal
quality
in
the
finish
overall
i
could
not
find
any
thing
to
complain
about
this
is
a
solid
kolsch
with
a
honey
addition
i
found
this
enjoyable
with
some
lager
qualities
and
it
does
not
seem
as
strong
as
5
9
but
the
honey
could
be
smoothing
out
the
feel
a
bit
a
series
of
beer
i
keep
buying
and
just
adore
if
as
much
for
the
idea
of
estate
beers
as
for
the
beers
themselves
sometimes
kolsch
never
really
gets
me
off
only
occasionally
but
the
addition
of
this
honey
makes
this
one
really
nice
its
super
light
pale
almost
white
straw
color
with
a
slurpee
looking
white
head
the
nose
is
really
lemony
almost
at
the
expense
of
honey
malt
is
extraordinarily
light
minimal
flavor
and
feel
from
it
the
honey
is
more
apparent
in
the
taste
right
up
front
where
malt
would
normally
be
some
sweetness
its
not
dried
out
all
the
way
which
probably
saves
the
flavor
about
halfway
through
the
lemon
kicks
in
i
have
no
idea
if
there
is
lemon
in
this
or
not
but
wow
is
there
a
zesty
citrus
finish
on
this
thing
cuts
through
the
honey
sweetness
carbonation
is
soft
and
the
beer
is
expansive
on
the
palate
despite
being
all
day
light
what
i
like
most
about
it
is
the
idea
of
homegrown
ingredients
but
the
beer
itself
is
also
pretty
darn
yummy
just
right
for
summer
and
a
cool
continuation
of
the
series
definitely
worth
picking
up
and
it
was
a
beauty
from
the
tap
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
the
body
has
a
light
gold
color
with
a
small
thin
head
the
smell
has
a
sweet
and
grassy
smell
to
it
the
taste
has
that
great
kolsh
flavor
with
a
nice
hint
of
honey
it
also
has
a
good
bite
to
it
mouthfeel
is
good
and
overall
a
good
beer
overall
a
rather
refreshing
brew
overall
with
a
nice
easy
drinking
feel
it
is
nice
for
the
price
while
on
tap
in
comparison
to
other
tap
prices
but
if
going
for
the
big
bottle
it
is
likely
not
worth
the
high
price
tag
o
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
super
for
style
o
easy
drinker
mostly
true
to
the
style
though
the
honey
adds
something
more
fortunately
the
honey
is
subtle
and
the
artful
use
of
hops
to
balance
the
additional
sweetness
with
a
very
balanced
bitterness
makes
an
the
easy
drinker
this
would
be
perfect
with
some
light
cheeses
and
crackers
with
fresh
fruit
on
a
patio
at
about
90
degrees
very
refreshing
overall
a
very
enjoyable
thirst
quencher
and
a
good
summer
beer
750ml
bottle
served
in
pint
glass
beer
pours
as
yellow
as
the
label
very
pale
and
nearly
clear
of
haze
medium
white
head
that
falls
quickly
immediate
aroma
of
honey
sweetness
flavor
is
super
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
all
the
flavors
here
are
really
subtle
and
well
balanced
if
on
the
sweet
side
overall
a
little
bit
of
german
hoppage
and
a
finish
of
honey
on
the
lips
carbonation
is
moderate
and
just
right
for
the
style
but
very
little
in
either
the
grain
bill
or
the
hop
load
to
distract
this
could
be
the
worlds
most
indulgent
lawnmower
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
a
yellow
hue
with
a
foamy
white
head
i
get
lemon
from
the
aroma
though
i
cant
quite
tell
if
thats
it
honey
is
very
subtle
in
the
flavor
with
a
honey
consistency
also
coming
off
to
a
slight
extent
in
the
mouthfeel
lemon
again
is
the
dominant
flavor
the
beers
flavor
is
strongest
in
the
middle
but
somewhat
weak
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
he
beer
theres
hardly
any
hops
and
a
touch
of
carbonation
has
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
really
this
is
a
pretty
nice
drinking
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
now
and
again
a
delicate
twist
to
a
classic
style
well
balanced
crisp
and
toasty
notes
complemented
with
fruit
flavors
present
in
this
altstyle
beer
pair
beautifully
with
rogues
own
homegrown
hops
and
honey
the
dry
notes
and
almost
europeanlike
flavors
from
the
hops
combine
really
well
to
make
a
great
american
example
of
classic
german
beer
style
odmayb
the
bright
painted
bottle
threw
me
off
at
first
once
i
tried
it
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
agreeable
i
have
no
huge
qualms
with
this
averageatbest
beer
except
for
its
ridiculous
pricetag

ripoff
pours

hazy

settles
to
wisps
of

on

of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of

form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
grass
and
white
grape
juice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
white
grape
juice
and
honey
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
fruit
forward
presence
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
that
makes
this
one
tasty
and
refreshing
on
visiting
a
sort
of
local
on
the
way
home
i
was
so
surprised
to
see
this
for
one
firstly
my
favourite
bottlo
did
not
get
it
in
and
they
could
of
and
two
its
a
bloody
bright
yellow
bottle
that
stands
out
like
dog
balls
in
a
sea
of
mecrioditityany
way
it
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
pretty
close
to
golden
hue
with
a
creamy
three
finger
head
and
heaps
of
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
banannavery
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
honey
almost
mead
likethe
feel
is
light
bodiedmoderately
carbonated
and
silky
smooth
with
pretty
simple
tastes
of
noble
hopsa
herbal
grassinesssweet
malts
and
finished
with
a
honey
alcoholniss
and
yeah
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
out
of
this
world
but
i
feel
the
keep
it
simple
stupid
method
works
for
this
one
and
even
though
i
wont
buy
it
again
it
is
bloody
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
like
today
cheers
this
is
a
nice
brew
flavors
are
full
yet
light
without
being
watery
dont
expect
any
bold
flavors
out
of
this
bright
golden
in

with
thin
white
head
aroma
of
cereal
grains
floral
notes
and
a
touch
of

a

undertone
of

in

with

carbonation
a

overall
nothing
terrible
about
this

just
nothing
very
exciting

in

and
body
o
pretty
above
average
kolsch
with
some
additional

o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
mostly
true
to
the
styleit
only
seems
that
the
grapelike
flavors
have
been
replaced
by

the

are
very
subtle
and
dont
contribute
any

overall
this
is
an
excellent

style
all
around
great
balance
and
robustness
of
malt

and
yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
good
drinkable
beer
and
edging
towards
a
lawnmower
beer
if
it
isnt
already
there
nice
beer
for
the
summer
good
beer
done
well
easy
drinking
smooth
and
tasty
enough
super
pleasant
brew
not
one
of
my
stellar
reviews
but
this
beer
is
just
really
damn
good
ive
had
quite
a
few
kolsches
and
this
one
wants
to
stick
with
me
its
a
good
one
not
a
departure
from
a
sturdy
german
example
and
a
lot
better
than
many
of
the
american
light
variants
that
ive
had
i
like
the
crispness
of
the
hops
the
almostunrelenting
bitterness
and
the
flavors
are
right
as
rain
well
done
honey
kolsch
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
malty
with
very
subtle
hints
of
honey
the
taste
is
nice
and
crisp
good
malt
base
and
nice
honey
notes
nice
flavors
honey
isnt
overpowering
however
beer
is
a
little
flat
overall
a
nice
sweet
and
refreshing
beer
i
absolutely
adore
this
ale
its
delicate
nondry
character
is
quirky
charming
and
friendly
perhaps
im
a
sucker
for
sweetness
but
this
beer
was
build
for
a
honeysoaked
face
lift
drinks
very
easy
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
easily
one
the
better
beers
rogues
has
put
out
in
a
while
poured
into
a
stange
glass
the
beer
pours
clear
golden
with
a
thin
whit
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
there
are
lots
of
bubbles
visible
in
this
glass
indicating
abundant
carbonation
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
grain
husks
with
some
floral
notes
i
also
get
some
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
grassiness
the
hop
bitterness
is
more
pronounced
than
i
thought
it
would
be
from
the
aroma
i
get
those
grassy
and
floral
hop
notes
with
some
sweetness
from
the
honey
and
grain
character
from
the
malt
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
refreshing
beverage
as
a
beer
this
is
good
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
o
a
tasty
and
fairly
vibrant
brew
but
i
could
see
myself
buying
more
of
this
for
8
a
sixer
not
8
for
a
750ml
o
a
solid
kölsch
with
a
nice
balanced
fruitfloral
thing
going
on
along
with
the
added
sweetness
from
the
honey
the
sweetness
is
at
the
perfect
level
and
doesnt
get
too
out
of
control
a
bit
pricey
but
the
bottle
is
cool
to
keep
around
overall
well
if
nothing
else
its
a
far
far
better
use
of
honey
than
that
downright
deplorable
19
original
colonies
mead
a
tasty
enough
kölsch
if
one
which
leans
a
bit
too
heavily
on
those
other
german
pale
alcoholic
beverages
for
their
fruity
input
maybe
it
comes
from
the
particular
honey
used
here
but
it
was
an
interesting
experience
and
an
agreeable
twist
on
this
specific
oldworld
style
a
real
neat
take
on
a
kolsch
and
i
like
this
subtle
honey
kick
and
mouthcoating
in
the
end
a
must
try
treat
for
kolsch
fans
fortunately
the
flavor
is
much
improved
theres
some
fruity
sweetness
to
the
initial
taste
light
bitterness
in
the
swallow
for
balance
short
aftertaste
full
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
o
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
enjoyable
and
definitely
one
that
i
would
grab
regularly
for
outdoor
events
when
it
is
warm
out
there
light
beer
with
a
smooth
finish
not
bad
but
if
youre
looking
for
big
flavor
this
isnt
it
taste
is
golden
malt
with
an
ample
black
pepper
hop
in
back
for
balance
green
apple
sweetness
bit
of
a
tweener
in
the
mouthfeel
department
not
as
crisp
as
a
kolsch
but
not
as
smooth
as
a
golden
ale
i
guess
thats
why
its
a
kolsch
style
golden
ale
drinks
mild
but
provides
plenty
of
flavor
with
the
yeast
doing
much
of
the
work
while
spicy
hops
smooth
things
out
has
a
nice
crusty
bread
feel
i
enjoy
with
the
other
flavors
presented
great
in
the
utah
heat
taste
palate
the
flavor
profile
is
very
clean
and
light
there
is
a
very
modest
and
refreshing
cracker
like
malty
base
with
mild
lemony
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
quick
and
fairly
dry
you
may
say
im
being
to
hard
on
this
one
and
it
isnt
horrible
but
it
taste
like
something
i
would
drink
while
grilling
or
tailgating
and
given
a
choice
i
would
rather
have
a
cheap
american
light
beer
than
this
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
this
leans
toward
an
ale
for
a
hybrid
but
with
higher
than
average
carbonation
very
tasty
and
fairly
crisp
though
a
great
summer
beer
overall
way
decent
for
a
4
utah
supermarket
beer
overall
a
very
enjoyable
kolsch
uinta
beers
are
always
very
solid
and
drinkable
this
beer
packs
a
pretty
impressive
punch
for
being
4
abv
definitely
recommended
american
style
kolsch
slight
darker
and
heavier
than
the
classic
german
variety
the
aroma
is
biscuit
and
hay
with
a
slight
sweetness
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
bright
white
thick
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
carbonation
is
noticeable
on
the
palate
the
flavor
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
the
slightest
tip
towards
the
malt
sweetness
overall
this
is
certainly
not
a
german
kolsch
but
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
quite
refreshing
cold
and
becomes
more
complex
as
it
warms
i
feel
like
theres
a
good
kolsch
to
be
had
here
but
this
particular
bottle
at
least
had
some
off
flavors
going
on
ill
update
if
i
try
a
better
one
in
the
future
overall
refreshing
easydrinking
solid
enough
for
an
americanborn
kölsch
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
ease
of
drinkability
while
the
aroma
and
flavoring
were
rather
simple
and
clean
with
warmth
the
bitterness
mixed
oddly
with
the
wateredthrough
middle
causing
the
ultimate
blend
of
flavors
to
become
muddled
and
unattractive
if
kept
towards
a
colder
temperature
this
beer
can
be
your
typical
drink
from
the
bottle
on
a
hot
summers
day
type
of
beer
but
otherwise
there
are
more
refined
and
flavorful
beers
for
the
style
and
from
this
brewery
i
had
this
on
tap
at
t
brendan
oreillys
and
it
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
before
i
knew
it
i
had
drank
75
of
it
and
wasnt
really
taking
notes
so
here
is
my
take
on
it
summarized
a
good
kölsch
solid
drinkable
and
not
sweet
with
balance
of
malt
and
yeast
with
a
pleasant
finish
and
gentle
toast
from
the
malt
in
the
flavor
high
c
o
i
enjoy
subtlely
flavored
beers
but
this
one
is
a
little
too
subtle
for
me
pretty
average
across
the
board
maybe
ill
have
to
revisit
it
again
sometime
to
see
if
i
missed
something
notes
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
rather
good
not
over
powering
and
it
has
a
good
dry
finish
also
very
drinkable
cheers
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
clean
beer
its
rather
malty
which
is
its
only
slight
set
back
the
hops
are
there
and
it
is
close
to
balanced
its
highly
drinkable
and
definitely
sessionable
its
another
offering
from
uinta
thats
worth
checking
out
not
a
bad
little
beer
but
the
aroma
is
the
high
point
if
i
ever
come
across
a
fresher
bottle
ill
revisit
taste
is
nice
full
fruity
grain
apple
hint
of
faint
herb
and
flowers
with
a
mostly
grassy
bitterness
which
is
light
and
balances
the
light
sweetness
overall
its
fairly
dry
very
minerally
crisp
this
is
a
kolsch
really
way
too
far
into
ale
territory
in
my
opinion
body
is
quite
thick
profile
is
quite
intense
for
the
style
too
leafy
too
earthy
and
not
filtered
enough
i
want
to
say
as
a
beer
sure
it
works
but
this
tastes
like
generic
homebrew
to
me
as
opposed
to
something
refined
as
a
kolsch
should
be
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
and
i
will
buy
it
again
utah
is
strange
about
its
liqour
laws
so
it
hinders
what
a
real
beer
should
taste
like
not
the
best
kolsch
ive
had
because
of
the
strange
flavor
combos
a
tasty
session
beer
with
a
low
abv
thats
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
pounding
or
a
hot
day
sweet
and
malty
for
the
kolsch
style
which
i
found
very
enjoyable
overall
a
decent
hot
weather
brew
but
it
doesnt
distinguish
itself
well
enough
for
the
style
for
all
i
would
know
this
could
be
some
sort
of
pale
lager
despite
it
not
being
a
great
kolsch
its
still
doable
im
not
sure
if
the
beer
is
extract
brewed
or
not
but
i
cant
get
that
taste
or
smell
out
of
my
head
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
but
i
will
not
be
reaching
for
this
one
again
o
one
of
the
better
crafted
kolsch
style
beers
ive
had
extremely
sessionable
flavorful
and
great
for
summer
drinking
light
and
biscuity
with
a
touch
of
grain
huskiness
it
does
maintain
a
steady
body
throughout
and
a
tight
crispness
on
the
end
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
that
doulbes
as
a
good
summer
ale
overall
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
and
it
is
quite
enjoyable
o
a
nice
kolsch
good
backyard
cookout
summertime
brew
for
sure
ill
definitely
have
it
again
nothing
special
here
a
very
standard
an
unexciting
pale
beer
pours
clear
and
washed
out
yellow
looking
with
a
decent
white
head
smells
like
a
beer
a
bit
of
euro
malts
but
nothing
memorable
in
the
nose
flavor
is
equally
dull
its
crisp
and
refreshing
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
this
is
a
style
of
beer
that
can
be
quite
exciting
when
done
properly
im
not
sure
why
this
one
is
so
flat
feel
is
fine
well
carbonated
and
very
very
light
on
the
body
i
wont
buy
this
again
not
because
its
bad
but
because
its
boring
i
prefer
the
hop
notch
from
uinta
i
think
is
is
a
fine
kolsch
which
reminds
me
i
dont
really
like
this
style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
puffy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
splotches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
maltgrain
white
grape
juice
and
some
nice
honey
aromas
taste
is
of
maltgrain
honey
and
a
grassy
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
with
each
sip
that
quickly
fades
from
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
quite
sessionable
at
only
4
abv
i
will
keep
this
one
in
mind
for
summer
cookouts
o
not
too
shabby
a
nice
session
beer
that
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
get
regularly
especially
once
summer
hits
o
disappointing
kolsch
is
my
style
but
every
time
i
try
a
new
american
interpretation
im
left
wondering
if
any
of
them
have
ever
had
a
traditional
example
from
koln
cant
recall
the
last
good
one
i
had
colorado
kolsch
is
the
last
one
that
came
close
clear
yellow
color
minimal
bubbles
with
a
couple
rising
to
the
surface
smells
sort
of
grainy
flavor
is
grainy
malt
cereals
not
very
crisp
and
not
very
hoppy
despite
what
the
label
says
very
easy
to
drink
though
since
the
abv
is
so
low
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
is
my
least
favorite
for
the
style
and
i
wont
make
a
repeat
purchase
on
this
one
overall
just
real
solid
very
enjoyable
now
that
i
see
its
4
i
am
getting
another
overall
impression
decent
light
offering
good
flavor
but
nothing
interesting
enough
to
make
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
a
great
light
beer
such
an
improvement
over
the
standard
lagers
harmons
markets
in
salt
lake
have
single
12
oz
bottles
available
of
a
bunch
of
the
uinta
and
other
local
lowoctane
beers
pours
a
pale
gold
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
on
top
retained
well
some
lace
left
behind
the
nose
is
fresh
with
lemon
and
other
zest
and
the
commontothisstyle
aroma
of
cutgrass
nice
mouth
carbonation
is
spoton
not
too
sprtizy
faint
lemon
flavors
cracker
bread
mild
hops
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
im
gonna
go
grab
a
sixer
of
this
this
weekend
if
its
still
around
light
and
refreshing
in
body
and
feel
not
much
hop
presence
other
than
a
very
faint
hoppy
taste
in
the
back
the
malts
arent
sweet
and
have
a
biscuity
quality
to
them
that
ends
up
leaving
a
slightly
weird
aftertaste
and
linger
effervescent
mouthfeel
in
its
light
airiness
but
manages
to
be
crisp
to
the
tongue
and
a
little
bit
prickly
in
carbonation
not
the
best
kolsch
ive
had
but
then
again
its
not
bad
just
nothing
all
that
exciting
about
it
unlike
uintas
other
low
abv
selection
in
baba
black
sheep
i
thought
that
one
was
very
unique
and
well
done
whereas
this
one
is
a
little
on
the
bland
side
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
golden

nice

with
some

note
the
taste
is

slightly
hoppy
medium

a
pretty
tasty
brew
a
nice
thrist
quencher
overall
a
nice
beer
in
a
rather
uncommon
style
would
have
liked
just
a
touch
more
hop
presence
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
see
many
on
line
dont
care
for
it
a
lot
i
dont
know
why
but
to
me
it
is
awesome
overall
pretty
standard
kolsch
a
little
more
hop
character
and
less
malt
flavor
would
have
been
nice
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
three
finger
white
head
that
receded
quickly
leaving
abundant
lacing
quite
nice
looking
scents
of
floral
german
hops
biscuity
malt
and
fruity
cherrylike
aromas
a
simple
true
to
style
aroma
that
is
quite
pleasing
flavor
begins
with
a
nice
biscuitlike
malt
presence
with
a
slight
fruitiness
hard
to
discern
the
individual
fruit
but
i
pick
up
some
apple
and
pear
this
moves
into
a
nice
clean
grainy

flavor
with
moderatelow

of
floral

and

finish
is
dry
with

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
kolsch
it
hits
the
style
guidelines
pretty
spot
on
and
while
it
doesnt
do
anything
amazingly
out
of
the
ordinary
it
is
still
quite
nice
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
straw
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
aromas
of
bready
pilsner
with
hints
of
sugary
and
fruity
sweetness
and
a
very
faint

the
flavor
is

that
mixes
fairly
well
with

balance
this
fairly
well
light
to
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
nice
summer
brew
shiner
kolsch
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
and
most
people
who
drink
it
will
find
it
acceptable
at
worst
and
pleasing
at
best
it
does
offer
crispness
and
refreshment
on
a
warm
day
and
even
if
it
isnt
the
most
exciting
brew
it
is
still
worthy
of
an
occasional
try
this
is
a
good
beer
balanced
pleasant
flavor
from
start
to
its
crisp
finish
pleasantly
effervescent
this
came
unexpectedly
in
an
assortment
of
shiner
beers
and
was
a
pleasant
surprise
quite
refreshing
this
makes
me
want
to
revisit
the
kolsch
variety
and
explore
some
more
different
ones
its
an
excellent
kolsch
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
pretty
clear
and
slightly
orangy
amber
crisp
fruity
aroma
has
a
powdereddrink
undertone
flavor
is
not
strong
but
is
pleasingly
crisp
fruity
a
little
dusty
and
a
little
sour
smooth
fizzy
texture
is
powdery
and
just
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
a
refreshing
way
to
welcome
summer
which
it
might
as
well
be
right
now
in
atlanta
and
its
only
midmay
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
floral
citrus
and
hops
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
mellows
out
for
an
easy
drinking
a
kolsch
should
be
a
fruity
and
mellow
this
beer
seems
borderline
on
a
kolsch
and
an
blonde
ale
pours
with
a
small
white
head
not
especially
appealing
metallic
smell
at
first
mild
light
nice
flavor
however
with
a
slight
metallic
twang
subtle
tastes
of
sweet
heartiness
and
corn
refreshing
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
decent
summer
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
or
particularly
impressive
for
the
style
yellow
clear
with
some
head
this
beer
may
fall
short
of
the
kolsch
style
in
that
the
maltiness
may
be
a
little
sweeter
and
the
hops
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
but
it
really
is
a
smooth
and
easy
beer
to
drink
and
im
happy
that
my
dadinlaw
picked
up
the
6pack
a
solid
highly
drinkable
summer
beer
my
experience
with
the
style
is
not
extensive
so
i
cant
put
it
into
perspective
relative
to
what
its
supposed
to
be
but
i
liked
it
could
use
some
bubbles
though
maybe
i
just
got
an
undercarbonated
bottle
actually
the
second
bottle
was
much
better
in
this
respect
being
this
is
the
first
kolsch
beer
i
have
ever
tried
i
was
a
little
suprised
when
i
saw
that
it
had
a
little
bit
of
a
yellow
tinge
to
it
but
loved
the
way
it
taste
very
nice
summer
beer
for
those
long
dog
days
of
summer
in
tx
i
would
drink
this
agian
and
will
definatly
have
to
say
shiner
is
100
dead
on
with
each
of
thier
beers
this
is
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
from
an
average
at
best
brewery
give
it
a
try
if
its
on
sale
t
american
brewed
light
beer
with
herbal
and
citrus
notes
you
bet
its
easy
to
quaff
pure
summer
beer
the
slightly
sweet
finish
of
this
beer
combined
with
its
herbal
and
citrus
notes
could
do
very
well
next
to
some
spicy
thai
food
or
hell
pair
it
with
any
bbq
style
fare
flavor
is
clean
and
refreshing
but
very
light
almost
all
grain
husk
slightly
sweet
with
lots
of
carbonation
hops
are
understated
but
this
one
has
fuller
flavor
than
many
pale
lagers
dry
finish
overall
an
okay
summer
beer
just
a
cool
beverage
for
a
hot
thirsty
day
shiner
kolsch
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
gold
body
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
white
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
minor
lacing
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
grainy
and
a
bit
husky
but
otherwise
clean
and
just
slightly
fruity
berries
and
apple
in
the
mouth
its
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
moderate
carbonation
that
softens
to
become
creamy
as
it
warms
the
flavor
reveals
a
sweetish
cereallike
malt
thats
backed
by
a
slap
of
spicy
and
herbal
hop
flavor
and
a
firm
bitterness
delicate
fruitiness
is
present
and
lingers
into
the
semidry
finish
along
with
some
sticky
malt
a
smear
of
leafy
hops
and
mild
bitterness
overall
its
a
pretty
drinkable
golden
or
blonde
ale
but
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
crispness
bitterness
or
finesse
of
a
proper
kolsch
enjoyable
this
brew
pours
an
extremely
brilliant
very
pale
golden
color
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
quickly
diminishes
into
a
thin
skim
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
moderatehigh
malty
sweetness
as
well
as
some
grainy
aroma
and
a
little
fruitiness
there
is
no
detectable
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
what
the
smell
advertises
moderatehigh
malt
sweetness
a
little
fruity
a
touch
of
grainy
flavor
and
a
low
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
the
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
quite
smooth
and
has
a
medium
body
overall
this
beer
is
well
done
the
flavor
is
very
clean
and
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
a
personal
preference
i
find
it
a
bit
sweet
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
these
although
maybe
my
mood
would
change
on
a
summer
day
instead
of
a
january
evening
what
impressed
me
most
was
the
appearance
cleanliness
and
smoothness
overall
a
nice
session
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
would
go
great
with
light
picnic
fare
a
great
offering
if
you
are
looking
for
something
a
little
tastier
then
the
usual
macro
brews
in
ga
we
dont
have
to
many
kolsch
beers
so
this
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
shiner
family
light
in
color
and
body
though
the
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
almost
wheat
like
with
a
mild
grape
flavor
with
a
mild
grassy
overtone
the
sample
i
tried
was
getting
close
to
being
out
of
date
but
this
beer
still
had
a
good
finish
one
of
the
best
beer
ive
tried
from
shiner
but
there
beers
still
seem
to
be
very
mild
and
boring
drinkability
dont
care
too
much
for
this
one
sorry
texans
i
really
dont
know
what
to
think
about
this
beer
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
seems
a
little
off
with
the
high
amounts
of
grape
flavored
sweetness
its
like
bubble
gum
i
would
have
expected
more
of
a
malty
beer
with
a
little
more
hop
profile
and
maybe
some
lemon
twang
i
prescribe
that
you
try
it
yourself
and
see
what
you
think
once
again
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
shiners
kölsch
is
a
fine
offering
for
the
summer
not
as
crisp
as
a
traditional
kölsch
but
has
a
nice
wet
finish
consider
it
a
good
alternative
to
the
shiner
blonde
for
bbqs
drinkability
a
tasty
thirst
quencher
and
a
nice
effort
of
an
underappreciated
style
had
to
hold
onto
this
last
one
for
the
review
mmm
its
good
great
on
the
hot
days
good
price
keeps
it
handy
as
a
lawnmower
aid
while
this
may
not
be
the
real
deal
it
is
a
damn
nice
beer
and
better
than
a
lot
of
other
kolschs
i
have
had
smell
is
curious
blend
of
pils
malt
and
a
rather
present
hop
spice
it
has
a
taste
of
light
malt
with
a
little
yeasty
carryon
but
the
hop
presence
is
what
really
makes
this
beer
not
really
there
but
spice
tang
plays
with
my
tongue
nice
body
and
a
pretty
clean
finish
4
went
well
with
the
opening
night
of
football
i
am
glad
to
have
this
on
the
regular
at
the
store
down
the
street
for
only
6
a
sixer
as
far
as
any
comparison
to
real
köln
kölsch
it
was
a
mild
almost
like
reminiscence
but
far
from
the
real
thing
its
like
the
difference
between
getting
a
nice
butterscotch
sundae
with
real
butterscotch
and
real
ice
cream
at
a
dairystore
versus
getting
a
frozen
supermarket
prepackaged
frozenice
with
butterscotch
flavoring
faint
reminders
of
the
real
thing
pours
a
brassy
gold
color
with
very
active
carbonation
and
a
thin
white
head
head
hardly
lasts
smells
of
sweet
pale
malts
and
grain
i
can
strain
out
a
slight
whiff
of
hops
but
i
mostly
just
get
a
bunch
of
grain
malts
taste
sweet
and
bready
and
the
graininess
isnt
nearly
as
present
as
in
the
aroma
thankfully
some
light
herbal
hops
make
an
appearance
body
is
light
and
bubbly
and
really
suits
the
light
flavors
well
this
doesnt
really
knock
me
back
in
terms
of
flavor
presence
or
anything
but
its
very
refreshing
and
crisp
this
is
actually
a
fairly
nice
kolsch
its
been
my
favorite
of
the
shiner
lineup
for
several
years
it
used
to
be
their
summer
stock
beer
good
to
see
another
addition
to
the
domestic
kolsch
list
but
this
one
is
miles
behind
pyramid
curve
ball
and
others
high
quality
summer
brew
one
of
the
easiest
brews
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
definitely
recommended
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
very
light
gold
crystal
clear
small
head
despite
vigorous
pour
the
aroma
was
slightly
hoppy
a
bit
of
malt
and
pear
flavor
was
more
hops
than
malt
but
you
did
get
a
slight
sweet
taste
in
there
overall
very
well
balanced
light
and
drinkable
low
carbonation
dry
finish
an
excellent
summer
beer
pours
a
very
nice
golden
color
that
appears
to
be
fairly
full
bodied
fairly
good
amount
of
head
but
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
good
with
fruity
hops
and
floral
scents
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
a
nice
refreshing
flavor
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
a
hot
texas
summer
day
a
an
excellent
session
beer
for
summer
well
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
to
this
beer
before
drinking
i
mean
an
authentic
kolsch
made
by
shiner
yeah
poured
a
clear
light
golden
with
a
thinner
white
head
that
was
gone
quite
quicklyaromas
of
wet
grain
somewhat
unpleasant
at
first
it
grows
on
ya
a
bit
some
underlying
toastiness
in
there
as
well
flavors
are
soft
and
malty
pleasant
woulbd
be
a
good
word
for
it
lightly
sweet
like
clover
honey
but
with
crisp
dry
crackerlike
backbone
finishing
lightly
floral
from
a
small
dose
of
hops
this
would
be
the
perfect
lawn
mower
beer
or
baseball
brew
its
light
but
has
a
little
flavor
and
quite
refreshing
in
the
finish
as
far
as
im
concerned
spoetzl
brewery
brews
beer
that
ranges
from
lousy
to
decent
shiner
kolsch
fits
somewhere
in
the
middle
probably
favoring
the
decent
end
of
the
spectrum
i
know
one
thing
it
aint
no
kolsch
i
know
another
as
well
this
is
the
last
time
that
ill
drink
it
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
noted
pours
a
crystal
clear
greenish
gold
with
a
thin
head
and
minimal
lacing
faint
malty
aroma
with
light
citrus
fruit
notes
taste
is
smooth
refreshing
and
well
balanced
between
the
bready
malts
and
bitter
hops
a
crisp
clean
finish
make
this
an
ideal
summer
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
mild
sweetness
that
quickly
dies
out
with
a
slick
slide
down
the
tongue
to
a
quick
cutting
dryness
average
looking
pale
yellow
nothing
too
impressive
very
fresh
and
crisp
taste
hints
of
lemon
perfect
for
summer
as
the
name
suggests
smell
was
a
bit
off
i
thought
but
it
didnt
take
too
much
away
from
the
overall
package
had
a
decent
mouth
taste
not
too
much
carbonation
just
enough
to
feel
right
while
drinking
and
help
spread
the
flavour
in
your
mouth
worth
buying
as
its
not
to
expensive
the
clear
golden
body
of
shiner
kolsch
gives
off
a
tart
slightly
sour
funkyskunky
aroma
with
funky
fruit
including
lemon
this
drinks
mostly
crisp
and
clean
with
delicate
spice
followed
by
a
flash
of
mild
fruit
midpalate
then
a
medium
bitterness
the
finish
is
dry
clean
and
moderately
bitter
certainly
this
beer
was
brewed
for
warm
weather
drinking
and
in
that
respect
it
seems
to
have
accomplished
its
goal
however
unoffensive
and
refreshing
though
it
may
be
shiner
kolsh
really
just
doesnt
stand
out
nor
does
it
give
me
much
reason
to
switch
from
the
much
more
affordable
and
equally
neutral
miller
high
life
for
my
thirstquenching
needs
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
like
a
macro
lager
with
personality
it
looks
like
budweiser
or
whatever
maybe
a
little
healthier
looking
i
e
it
has
some
color
but
the
head
sticks
around
smells
sweet
and
of
grain
the
taste
matches
the
smell
refreshing
malt
sweetness
without
overdoing
it
the
mouthfeel
is
even
and
smooth
and
leaves
your
mouth
feeling
clean
this
is
a
good
anytime
beer
and
definitely
beats
shiners
hefeweizen
second
only
to
their
dunkelweizen
bottom
line
you
can
do
better
harpoons
summer
beer
for
example
but
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
worth
a
try
appears
a
clear
yellow
golden
hue
forms
a
large
white
head
with
fine
speckled
lacing
all
around
my
tall
kolsch
glass
aroma
is
sweet
honey
tinged
grain
with
a
touch
of
corn
and
rice
present
but
clean
overall
taste
has
a
layer
of
grain
and
hop
sweetness
with
honey
tinged
foresty
grassy
hop
leaves
very
nice
profile
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
even
carbonation
cant
complain
drinkability
is
excellent
speaks
tones
of
summer
towards
my
idea
of
a
beer
this
is
a
nice
drinking
summer
brew
a
clean
dry
finish
to
a
clean
and
refreshing
tasty
brew
i
would
have
liked
more
of
a
drier
finish
a
light
body
as
is
the
carbonation
a
good
crisp
and
smooth
drinking
beer
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
nearly
as
clear
as
water
wow
some
macros
look
dark
compared
to
this
amazingly
the
head
holds
very
well
but
leaves
little
lacing
on
the
glass
very
lackluster
grainy
aroma
weak
lemon
and
grassy
taste
im
searching
for
a
real
redeeming
quality
here
while
the
taste
is
light
it
does
have
a
nice
crisp
bite
and
an
extremely
refreshing
finish
this
is
lawnmower
all
the
way
very
light
and
highly
drinkable
would
be
a
good
crossover
beer
for
someone
who
needs
the
taste
of
a
macro
but
in
craft
beer
form
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
tall
pillowy
white
head
that
sticks
all
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
dissipates
into
a
heavy
lace
nose
is
fairly
weak
but
there
are
faint
notes
of
bready
malts
and
lemon
grass
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
active
carbonation
taste
is
sweet
malts
and
grassy
grains
followed
by
some
lemony
citrus
notes
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
texas
summer
day
overall
impression
not
a
thrilling
beer
but
it
is
a
decent
summer
offering
the
hops
come
on
to
keep
it
pretty
balanced
but
after
a
few
it
gets
pretty
sweet
curse
of
the
well
made
mild
beer
mild
scores
i
could
see
bringing
a
case
to
a
picnic
pale
slightly
deep
golden
hue
limited
head
and
limited
retention
aroma
is
slightly
of
floral
hops
taste
is
smooth
well
blended
floral
hops
with
some
carmel
malt
character
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thick
for
style
drinkable
and
decent
but
not
earthshattering
12
ounce
bottle
used
to
be
the
shiner
summer
stock
now
the
kolsch
and
a
nice
one
at
that
thin
body
but
not
watery
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
yawn
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
really
clean
the
style
dictates
that
there
be
a
sulfur
presence
but
in
this
case
i
think
that
it
is
a
bit
too
much
my
experience
with
drinking
kolsch
in
koln
is
that
they
finish
a
whole
lot
drier
and
more
refreshing
this
beer
finishes
slightly
malty
with
some
residual
sweetness
left
to
linger
on
the
palate
it
is
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
after
you
get
done
mowing
the
lawn
but
one
that
i
would
turn
down
if
i
am
bopping
around
a
trinkmarkt
in
koln
this
beer
pours
nice
and
clear
with
a
one
to
one
and
a
half
finger
head
the
head
fades
quickly
and
does
not
stick
with
this
beer
too
well
overall
the
appearance
is
very
average
the
smell
is
very
faint
of
citrus
and
grains
undetectable
this
beer
really
surprises
when
it
hits
your
mouth
the
texture
is
smooth
and
full
with
a
bit
of
carbonated
sharpness
the
flavor
much
more
body
than
the
color
and
look
would
suggest
overall
a
nice
beer
will
drink
again
drinkability

this
isnt
bad
for
an
american
addjunk
entry
but
putting
the
word
kölsch
on
the
label
is
like
giving
camaron
diaz
a
mensa
scarf
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
and
little
or
no
lacing
color
is
bright
gold
very
beautiful
aroma
is
subdued
malt
sweetness
and
slightly
breadyfruity
low
hop
aroma
peeks
through
with
a
little
spiciness
flavor
is
very
soft
and
delicate
starts
with
sweet
maltiness
that
is
conterbalanced
by
a
soft
smooth
bitterness
finishes
malty
and
clean
mouthfeel
is
just
right
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
except
for
head
retention
another
good
but
not
great
brew
from
shiner
great
suupping
beer
goes
down
like
water
very
easy
to
drink
and
nicely
refreshing
this
is
an
excellent
summer
cooler
i
believe
this
is
simply
a
new
label
for
the
beer
formerly
known
as
summer
stock
i
could
be
mistaken
but
why
would
they
produce
more
than
one
kolsch
style
beer
pours
an
appetizing
clear
golden
hue
with
a
oneinch
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
after
a
minute
or
two
crisp
clean
nose
of
very
light
sweet
malt
light
floral
hops
a
touch
of
honey
and
some
astringency
palate
is
subtle
with
a
bit
of
a
nice
hoppy
zing
mixed
in
with
some
light
malt
honey
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
grass
nice
medium
body
could
use
a
little
bit
more
flavor
but
its
still
a
good
summer
beer
poured
clear
and
golden
into
my
glass
and
developed
an
adequate
head
detected
some
hints
of
grassiness
but
the
hops
was
more
pronounced
possesses
an
excellent
and
authentic
kölsch
taste
which
transported
me
back
to
my
favorite
köln
bierstube
mouthfeel
was
crisp
with
sufficient
carbonation
to
keep
it
lively
as
it
went
down
my
throat
easy
to
quaff
quickly
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
to
enjoy
more
slowly
with
friends
my
favorite
shiner
product
light
yellow
clear
with
some
carbonation
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
head
is
a
thin
white
lace
smells
clean
and
grainy
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
clean
and
grainy
very
crisp
with
hints
of
lemon
zest
and
slighty
grassy
moderate
carbonated
body
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
perfect
brew
for
the
summer
clean
refreshing
and
priced
nicely
as
well
drinkability
not
bad
definitely
a
summer
time
beer
good
for
yard
work
mouthfeel
is
alright
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
a
bad
product
just
seems
to
barely
meet
the
style
def
rather
than
trying
to
do
something
interesting
to
distinguish
itself
worth
having
if
you
stumble
on
it
but
not
particularly
worth
crossing
the
road
for
brilliant
golden
yellow
with
a
soft
wispy
white
head
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
wheat
is
most
noticable
on
the
nose
with
very
mild
hops
also
present
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
hefe
with
some
mild
banana
notes
crisp
wheat
flavors
dominate
the
palate
light
crisp
mouthfeel
long
slightly
metallic
finish
a
decent
kosh
wish
it
was
more
to
style
like
my
favorite
schlalfy
still
worth
a
try
if
you
run
across
it
well
i
wish
this
was
more
kolsch
like
there
was
no
need
to
add
any
wheat
sorry
but
this
beer
is
more
wheatlike
than
kolsch
like
unfortunately
lets
go
over
the
details
bright
brilliant
golden
head
left
when
i
looked
away
for
a
second
wheat
beer
aroma
primarily
of
double
bubble
taste
is
pretty
wheat
beer
like
bubblegummy
yeastiness
and
lemon
zest
in
the
finish
not
awful
but
left
wanting
more
kolschiness
thansk
to
fellow
ba
charlesw
for
the
beer
to
try
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
some
light
golden
hues
with
a
fluffy
white
head
leaving
a
slight
lace
aromas
are
of
light
malts
and
a
citrus
lemony
scent
flavors
are
of
light
sweet
malts
follow
by
a
nice
citrus
hop
and
lemony
bite
this
beer
is
crisp
with
a
nice
light
body
and
somewhat
creamy
texture
a
nice
summer
beer
but
after
visiting
cologne
i
cant
quite
call
it
a
true
kolsch
thanks
to
assurbanipaul
for
the
sample
an
excellent
beer
and
the
kölsch
beers
are
becoming
a
new
favorite
of
mine
hope
i
can
find
some
that
hang
around
after
summer
im
thinking
im
gonna
have
to
pick
up
some
of
the
other
shiner
beers
but
you
can
be
sure
this
one
is
in
my
fridge
until
they
wont
sell
me
anymore
parting
thoughts
summer
stock
is
a
good
texas
beer
and
probably
just
right
for
the
summer
this
is
something
that
is
fairly
light
but
doesnt
lose
its
flavor
in
the
process
i
expected
much
less
out
of
this
nice
surprise
here
ps
love
the
horny
toad
on
the
label
these
guys
do
some
of
the
best
overall
designs
ive
seen
lately
translucent

modest
white

soapy

almost
no

the
strength
of
the
bouquet
was
minimal
lemony
grass

malt
with
a
kiss
of
sweetness
clean
respectable
palate
with
a
decent
blend
of
malt
and
lemongrasshay
rather
clean
if
not
boring
though
with
meager

easy

i
am
sure
this
would
work
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
is
this
shiners
best
product
excellent
summer
brew
of
course
shiner
is
a
staple
where
i
come
from
and
this
is
no
exception
it
has
a
nice
sunny
color
the
smell
was
good
but
a
little
weak
which
isnt
necesarily
a
bad
thing
but
i
had
to
take
a
serveral
good
whiffs
to
actual
smell
it
though
i
especially
enjoyed
the
slight
wheat
taste
to
it
the
drinkability
is
truely
excellent
after
a
long
day
at
school
i
easily
poured
two
of
them
down
my
throat
with
ease
and
expect
the
rest
will
be
the
same
not
bad
at
all
pours
an
ultra
clear
golden
hue
with
a
decent
2
finger
off
white
head
aromas
are
of
an
earthy
tone
and
really
quite
faint
it
has
a
slight
bread
and
lemon
taste
with
a
little
alcohol
on
the
tail
it
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
overall
crisp
mouthfeel
not
a
hugely
complex
brew
but
it
is
rather
refreshing
one
of
shiners
better
brews
cheers
notes
easy
to
drink
with
a
handful
of
flavour
on
the
label
it
says
kölsch
but
some
say
it
is
an
american
blonde
ale
either
way
it
is
a
brew
i
would
want
around
during
a
hot
summer
day
similar
in
stature
to
harpoon
summer
beer
i
first
had
fruh
in
koln
my
german
hosts
who
lived
there
recommended
it
highly
on
the
hot
summer
day
they
drank
it
halfhalf
with
fanta
orange
soda
and
while
i
took
a
sip
that
way
i
preferred
mine
regular
poured
in
a
koln
style
glass
i
found
it
very
refreshing
more
like
a
lager
than
a
pale
ale
look
was
super
clear
in
the
glass
with
a
small
head
light
hop
flavor
very
tasty
i
have
a
6pac
waiting
in
my
fridge
for
summer
its
almost
impossible
to
find
in
the
us
luckily
i
have
it
hand
delivered
by
my
friends
every
year
if
you
are
ever
where
this
is
available
you
must
give
it
a
try

as

for
the
style
but
nice
biscuit
and
light
hopping

flavor
perhaps
a
bit
thinner
than
other
kolsches
but
still
satisfying
o
really
good
for
what
it
is
nice
and
bright
flavors
with
a
solid
mouthfeel
definitely
a
tasty
beer
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
scale
no
apparent
faults
in
my
mind
i
got
this
one
from
somebody
that
just
came
back
from
germany
so
its
probably
pretty
fresh
compared
to
a
lot
of
shelf
stock
very
tasty
and
light
beer
love
it
great
light
beer
overall
it
is
rather
solid
and
satisfying
and
otherwise
certainly
fits
the
bill
but
it
presents
a

too
much
plasticlike
bitterness

in

along
with
some

the
taste
is
very
bitter
up

with
a
touch
of
tartness
and
followed
by
a
nice
bit
of
malty

the
mouthfeel
is
thin
crisp
and
somewhat
dry
but
super
refreshing
seems
like
the
perfect
afterwork
beer
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
as
a

its
topnotch

a

after

didnt
last
long
in

and
left
me
wanting
another
very
similar
to
a
pale
lager
in
a
lot
of
ways
i
wasnt
particularly
impressed
with
this
one
really
it
was
a
drinkable
beer
its
always
nice
to
get
a
new
style
under
my
belt
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
great
beer
really
clean
flavor
the
white
grape
is
noticeable
at
the
end
but
not
dominant
good
combo
of
hop
zip
and
carbonation
this
is
a
porch
pounding
beer
and
would
go
quite
well
with
grilled
white
meats
and
salads
the
taste
is
malt
oriented
with
mild
entry
and
gentle
hops
which
are
herbal
with
not
overly
bitter
taste
the
yeast
adds
fruitiness
with
subtle
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
background
and
pilsner
malt
taste
throughout
which
is
refined
and
subtle
but
hops
have
a
toned
down
effect
this
is
a
great
kolsch
might
be
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
it
is
a
treat
to
sip
and
savor
i
would
have
got
more
if
i
could
i
love
the
subtlety
and
drinkability
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
hope
to
get
more
of
this
specific
brand
as
well
as
some
other
kolschs
it
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
day
sitting
on
my
deck
o
reminds
me
of
the
sips
of
beer
my
german
grandfather
gave
me
when
i
was
little
for
me
a
kölsch
from
cologne
is
a
definitive
light
german
ale
and
there
is
none
better
than
früh
o
quite
drinkable
real
german
stuff
overall
never
seen
this
before
here
and
boston
for
a
kolsch
style
from
the
town
it
originated
in
this
beer
is
traditional
and
classic
i
will
be
getting
more
in
the
future
taste
is
clean
and
similarly
malty
buttered
biscuits
dough
dried
grass
and
some
white
grape
character
from
the
kölsch
yeast
feel
is
crisp
and
the
body
is
supple
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
dry
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
good
kölsch
would
try
again
and
look
for
a
fresher
date
on
the
bottle
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
grass
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
too
mild
in
my
opinion
but
its
that
friendly
fruityfloral
character
that
sets
this
kolsch
apart
its
a
fresh
and
crisp
taste
texture
and
aromatic
sense
that
allows
a
lively
mood
to
spring
forth
its
delicate
flavorful
and
soft
from
start
to
finish
according
to
warner
in
his
book
on
brewing
kolsch
this
is
one
of
the
palest
of
the
bunch
and
indeed
looks
like
a
cheap
adjunct
lager
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
small
quantity
of
white
foam
effervescent
and
bright
fortunately
it
does
not
taste
like
said
adjunct
lager
and
the
robust
carbonation
does
not
sear
the
tongue
currently
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
and
a
very
cool
find
aroma
is
very
fruity
robust
white
grape
and
lemon
rind
along
with
fresh
doughy
malt
and
a
pleasant
acid
tang
nothing
dark
at
all
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
i
have
yet
to
try
many
examples
of
this
style
but
this
is
the
fruitiest
to
date
with
that
musty
white
grape
character
on
the
nose
carrying
over
onto
the
palate
the
malt
is
subtle
yet
flavorful
white
buttermilk
biscuits
come
to
mind
along
with
a
sweet
cereal
character
crisp
fairly
dry
and
creamy
smooth
the
hops
are
mellow
and
tastefully
done
yielding
a
fragrant
hay
sort
of
vibe
but
without
too
many
floral
or
spice
notes
thin
to
moderate
body
with
maybe
a
bit
of
chalk
classic
kolsch
really
eminently
drinkable
but
not
lacking
in
flavor
a
fresh
despite
the
real
time
and
distance
between
me
and
the
source
of
this
offering
pale
euro
lager
meant
more
for
sunny

slightly

the

was
of

it

the

the

here
the

great

brew
a
true
bench
mark
of
the
marker
and
the
style
happy
to
have
o
truth
be
told
i
really
enjoy
a
good
kolsch
and
this
is
definitely
a
very
good
even
great
example
of
an
underappreciated
style
and
its
cheap
to
boot
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
a
good
kölsch
but
definitely
more
fragile
than
the
average
one
in
the
style
i
do
enjoy
the
lightened
crisp
feel
of
the
body
as
well
as
the
greenish
hop
profile
but
it
does
lack
a
little
bit
of
the
concentrated
fruitiness
i
enjoy
when
they
are
good
worked
very
well
as
an
aperitif
before
my
meal
i
could
definitely
have
a
bunch
of
these
in
one
setting
and
not
complain
although
it
would
be
far
more
for
the
refreshing
experience
it
provides
above
anything
else
drinking
kolsch
always
reminds
me
of
the
one
glaring
gap
in
my
glass
collection
i
need
a
stange
o
having
been
to
köln
and
tasted
several
kölschs
while
i
was
there
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
would
pair
well
with
food
very
refreshing
if
a
little
unremarkable
id
enjoy
again
but
perhaps
not
specifically
go
and
seek
it
out
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
wet
nice
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
or
overpowering
light
in
body
nice
grain
nice
finish
very
nice
beer
yeah
id
have
this
again
overall
a
quite
easy
drinking
kolsh
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
very
tart
and
complex
crisp
and
clean
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
very
far
removed
from
other
beers
that
ive
had
half
litre
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pale
colour
one
finger
head
which
was
quick
to
disappear
kept
some
lacing
clear
aroma
was
chardonay
and
vanilla
tasted
cranberry
chardonay
vanilla
and
yeast
finish
was
delayed
and
wheaty
crisp
texture
well
carbonated
which
gave
it
a
slightly
coarse
edge
enjoyable
beer
made
me
want
to
explore
the
style
further
bit
of
a
palate
changer
sweet
graininess
light
body
and
light
effervescence
toasted
grain
faint
butteriness
tart
fruit
flavors
bit
of
apple
sweet
grain
husk
faint
fruity
hoppy
bitterness
to
balance
pretty
good
very
clean
with
good
flavors
and
goes
down
like
water
overall
a
real
great
simple
drinking
kolsch
the
ultimate
kolsch
quest
continues
in
earnest
i
would
love
to
try
this
side
by
side
with
reissdorf
but
i
could
have
this
very
often
i
do
believe
ive
found
my
favorite
kölsch
a
delight
so
kölsch
is
ok
its
cool
drinking
it
outside
on
a
sunny
day
shootin
the
scheisse
its
the
first
time
i
drink
this
style
and
i
didnt
find
it
much
different
than
a
lager
also
since
its
the
first
time
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
drinkability
was
high

it

this
was
a

example
of
the
style
just
the
way
to
kick
off
a
tasting
that
was
only
moments
away
a
light
refreshing
beer
from
cologne
that
wont
fill
you
up
a
highly

brew
with

character
just

glasses
not

makes
a

for
a
kolsch
it
seems
you
can
drink
this
one
endlessly
o
some
interesting
fruity
and
vinous
notes
in
a
pleasantly
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
beer
that
feels
very
much
like
a
lager
mouthfeel
is
relatively
smooth
with
a
nice
crispness
to
the
finish
overall
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
especially
when
the
weather
is
warm
i
know
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
light
even
among
cologne
kolsch
but
it
still
has
both
the
fruit
and
the
spice
definitely
more
going
on
than
your
average
lager
this
would
kill
on
a
summer
day
it
is
an
interesting
beer
at
least
it
isnt
monotonous
dont
be

from
koln

as
expected
this
was
a
tasty
and
crisp
little
ale
the
aroma
has
an
interested
toasted
popcorn
and
grain
character
with
a
tiny
hint
of
citrus
the
flavor
expands
on
the
dry
grainy
toast
with
biting
orange
peel
that
rolls
through
a
dry
finish
along
the
way
there
are
also
hints
of
sweet
apple
maybe
pink
lady
and
fresh
raspberries
and
blueberries
the
fruit
isnt
quite
as
big
as
reissdorf
but
its
still
all
very
well
balanced
check
out
this
kolsch
classic
when
you
get
a
chance
d
gracious
me
but
it
goes
goes
down
like
a
dream
drinkable
swiggable
enjoyable
good
with
a
meal
fresh
with
some
citruslike
smells
gives
the
beer
a
soft
and
smooth
drinkability
d
great
kolsch
its
the
complex
accent
flavours
that
when
me
over
way
better
at
the
brewery
then
from
a
bottle
notes
taste
like
an
above
average
german
pilsner
with
a
good
amount
of
golden
fruit
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
and
as
usual
a
great
drinkability
what
a
great
discovery
i
would
pair
this
head
to
head
with
young
chardonnay
in
a
wine
vs
beer
and
pair
it
with
lighter
food
fair
jumbo
prawns
with
a
light
citrus
sac
and
a
peppery
kick
of
arugula
would
match
with
beautifully
i
really
enjoyed
my
kolsch
and
look
foward
to
more
next
week
and
ironically
enough
the
top
rated
on
this
website
are
all
american
breweries
head
was
present
and
lasted
into
a
lace
down
the
glass
slight
bitter
and
aroma
of
hops
but
not
pungent
sweetish
light
and
refreshing
the
kolsch
size
while
frustrating
is
appropriate
i
would
not
see
myself
drinking
two
pints
in
a
row
of
this
but
three
of
the
small
glasses
spread
over
time
is
just
about
right
prosit
and
viva
colonia
mk
this
kolsch
in
my
opinion
can
only
be
experienced
on
tap
the
bottled
versions
tend
to
be
over
hopped
and
slightly
off
in
flavor
versus
the
tap
version
obviously
enjoying
a
fruh
kolsch
in
the
shadow
of
kolner
dome
is
very
unique
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
very
light
and
almost
airy
appearance
when
presented
in
the
kolsch
glass
if
you
are
looking
for
a
heafty
dense
beer
go
somewhere
else
it
is
one
of
my
personal
favorites
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day

true

d
this
is
a

easy

and
refreshing
but
its
not
outstanding
and
its
not
very
exciting
probably
one
for
those
warm
summer
nights
d
very
refreshing
brew
that
goes
down
easy
with
a
crisp
finish
d
good
drinkability
because
of
its
crisp
and
light
nature
as
well
as
hints
of
sweetness
md
not
comparable
with
the
natural
draught
version
at
all
which
is
much
more
pronounced
in
both
fruity
and
malty
compartments
this
bottle
has
shown
some
bad
impacts
from
maybe
pasteurisation
albeit
not
to
the
point
of
total
displeasure
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
sharp
and
fizzy
the
body
is
light
alright
but
the
finishing
touch
comes
somewhat
acidic
and
metallic
the
overall
performance
really
is
a
world
apart
from
itsgoodself
on
draught
hence
a
belowaverage
drinkability
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
but
overall
a
decent
brew
and
a
welcome
change
from
the
standard
german
pils
and
lager
better
ontap
d
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
overwhelming
a
nice
enjoyable
triumvirate
of
flavors
worth
visiting
again
more
or
less
like
a
good
helles
but
with
much
more
carbonation
and
hoppiness
and
saltier
as
well
very
very
drinkable
session
beer
not
my
favorite
koelsch
but
close
to
it
d
its
a
mediocre
kolsch
nice
malts
character
but
its
letdown
by
a
thin
body
solid
enjoyable
but
maybe
not
a
true
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
good
beer
in
the
style
kolschbier
taste
is
light
malty
with
a
clean
german
yeast
profile
some
sulfuric
notes
also
some
bitterness
and
a
slight
hoppiness
to
me
this
is
nothing
too
special
it
is
like
an
average
german
pils
purchased
in
a
500ml
bottle
at
the
bull
and
castle
in
dublin
poured
a
golden
smooth
color
with
light
2finger
white
head
not
too
much
smell
smooth
with
some
carbonation
and
light
hoppinessnothing
remarkable
though
tasted
better
and
cleaner
as
it
approached
room
temperature
a
bit
i
would
like
to
try
another
kölsch
style
beer
before
coming
back
to
this
one
the
definition
of
what
a
kolsch
should
be
while
in
munich
i
wanted
to
try
the
fruh
but
was
prevented
my
a
looong
night
at
a
turkish
bar
now
i
have
one
via
express
mail
great
light
color
and
smell
of
a
kolsch
crisp
and
clean
taste
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
kolsch
of
the
hightest
order
the
sort
only
found
in
bavaria
poured
out
a
bright
clear
golden
color
with
a
bone
white
head
the
nose
had
some
sweetness
to
it
and
fresh
grain
that
you
get
from
the
style
the
taste
echoes
the
nose
lots
of
fresh
grain
an
underlying
sweetness
and
just
a
slightly
bitter
finish
very
well
balanced
has
a
crisp
dry
mouthfeel
and
is
made
for
sessioning
this
is
an
ideal
drink
for
hot
weather
light
in
colourtaste
and
body
in
other
words
a
refreshing
beer
without
to
much
character
typical
of
all
kolsch
beers
fruh
is
better
than
most
though
for
flavour
overall
a
pretty
good
kolsch
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
d
very
drinkable
indeed
if
you
get
to
cologne
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
youre
not
in
the
true
koln
atmosphere
though
the
kolsch
is
actually
a
pretty
weak
beer
style
and
possibly
not
worth
the
effort
to
seek
out
pours
a
clear
straw
color
under
a
huge
three
finger
snow
white
head
with
great
body
retention
and
stickiness
leaving
good
healthy
lace
strings
very
nice
pour
the
nose
features
crisp
bready
malt
with
a
tinge
of
spicey
hop
the
mouth
is
very
light
and
very
prickly
the
taste
is
mild
and
sweet
in
the
opening
perhaps
a
bit
watery
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
a
splash
of
corn
syrup
the
hops
that
kick
in
later
are
extremely
dry
almost
parched
with
a
high
intensity
but
low
quantity
bitterness
that
lasts
and
lasts
this
is
a
nice
thirst
quencher
that
invites
another
round
this
kölsch
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
a
very
very
light
malt
aroma
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
backed
by
light
hop
bitterness
some
bready
malt
notes
as
well
as
some
floral
hop
flavors
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
crisp
with
light
body
and
good
carbonation
the
lightly
hoppy
flavor
lingered
a
bit
in
the
finish
this
was
a
good
easydrinking
and
thirst
quenching
beer
as
for
the
restaurant
itself
the
atmosphere
and
price
is
a
bit
abovescale
the
food
is
great
and
the
service
impeccable
how
does
the
beer
taste
well
its
simple
sweet
and
clean
like
any
other
koelsch
it
has
broad
appeal
that
also
means
that
there
isnt
really
anything
too
special
about
it
its
just
a
wellputtogether
beer
enjoy
with
friends
and
food
and
life
will
be

was
of
biscuity
malts
and
breadlike
aroma
with
a
slight
hop
spice
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
perfectly
balanced
with
the
nice
crisp
malts
dominating
the
flavor
a
slight
fruit
and
hop
bitterness
is
barely
noticeable
but
compliments
the
style
perfectly
this
beer
had
a
nice
light
body
and
went
down
easy
except
for
the
one
my
travel
mate
actually
knocked
down
onto
the
floor
overall
a
must
try
kolsch
for
all
fans
out
there
a
pale
yellow
in
color
but
it
does
not
lack
in
taste
the
fruh
brewery
produces
this
beer
with
a
creamy
malt
body
that
finishes
with
a
crisp
hoppiness
there
is
also
a
faint
taste
of
fresh
berries
i
dont
have
access
to
many
authentic
german
kolschs
in
my
area
so
i
jumped
at
the
chance
to
sample
this
one
i
was
quite
happy
with
my
find
still
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
pint
of
beer
should
i
say
an
excellent
kölsch
beer
for
sure
thanks
to
eva
for
bringing
this
back
from
germany
for
me
this
is
a
super
pale
golden
colour
with
a
fizzy
white
head
just
like
a
true
kölsch
should
be
the
smell
was
simple
and
consisted
of
berries
fruity
hops
and
light
bready
malts
the
taste
was
immensely
satisfying
with
hops
and
malts
having
some
great
interplay
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thirst
quenching
and
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
thanks
to
my
pal
dave
for
bringing
it
over
to
the
states
for
me
served
in
a
traditional
tall
thin
kölsch
glass
color
is
typical
of
kölschlight
completely
transparent
and
topped
by
a
fluffly
white
cloud
of
a
head
taste
is
scent
is
atypical
however
its
slightly
sweet
almost
in
a
sugar
like
way
theres
a
touch
of
tartness
but
its
extremely
subtle
like
all
kölsch
beers
its
a
clean
finish
and
light
in
the
stomach
one
of
my
favored
kölsch
beers
and
from
what
i
have
noticed
one
of
the
more
popular
kölsch
beers
thanks
to
jans
dad
for
this
treat
i
have
nothing
to
compare
this
to
since
it
was
my
first
kolsch
experience
but
it
had
a
medium
yellowish
color
slightly
darker
than
budweiser
and
was
cyrstal
clear
even
though
it
was
being
served
from
a
a
wooden
keg
using
gravity
the
head
was
light
frothy
and
bone
white
in
color
clean
crisp
tasting
malt
with
a
slight
fruitiness
finishes
with
a
mild
hop
twang
and
bitterness
like
a
mild
pilsner
very
refreshing
i
could
have
sat
and
had
about
30
of
these
they
were
served
in
2
liter
test
tube
like
glasses
that
was
replaced
without
question
whenever
you
were
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
like
it
a
lot
there
is
a
good
amount
of
smokiness
that
i
didnt
expect
its
a
hard
beer
to
rate
because
its
outside
its
style
so
much
not
a
fan
of
kolschs
for
the
most
part
the
dark
roasts
and
rye
contrasting
the
barnyard
light
kolsch
tastes
really
make
the
sprocketbier
shine
o
this
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
when
i
saw
kölch
on
the
label
at
first
its
more
indicative
of
a
stout
than
a
traditional
pale
of
the
name
but
i
have
no
complaints
delicious
drinkable
and
sessionable
another
solid
from
stone
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
could
use
a
bit
of
tweaking
maybe
its
because
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
kolsch
beers
worth
sharing
the
bottle
with
friend
salad
as
to
mouthfeel
this
is
obviously
heavier
than
your
average
kolsch
but
still
retains
considerable
drinkability
once
more
the
schwarzbier
comparisons
are
in
order
moderate
to
high
carbonation
with
some
welcome
hop
resin
prickliness
faint
wood
char
in
the
dry
breadlike
finish
obviously
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
bastardized
cutting
across
multiple
style
domains
faulting
it
for
not
tasting
like
a
classic
kolsch
seems
pedantic
and
persnickety
in
my
view
this
is
a
more
than
worthwhile
exercise
in
tasting
gymnastics
would
have
been
a
lot
better
if
it
had
more
alcvol
at
least
9
as
dark
as
pumpernickel
bread
with
a
similar
rye
aroma
the
smokiness
and
rye
notes
dominate
up
front
here
this
is
an
interesting
beer
has
a
mealy
mouthfeel
almost
like
drinking
a
reuben
sandwich
enjoyable
but
would
likely
not
seek
out
again
unless
pairing
with
food
beer
was
ok
not
the
best
o
3
75
by
look
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
id
call
this
a
stout
the
label
says
otherwise
either
way
it
is
really
tasty
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
5
4
abv
a
well
made
and
well
executed
beer
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
final
score
4
13
overall
whatever
this
style
is
supposed
to
be
that
hint
of
smoke
puts
me
firmly
onboard
i
dig
it
3
80
o
provides
a
deep
dark
roastiness
in
a
5
4
packaging
which
many
may
overlook
or
have
trouble
believing
roasted
coffee
and
yeasty
fruitiness
that
drinks
much
bigger
then
expected
nice
blending
dont
expect
a
true
kolsch
style
here
with
more
and
more
breweries
blurring
the
lines
its
hard
to
hold
one
accountable
when
it
doesnt
fit
snuggly
into
one
clearly
defined
parameter
when
it
clearly
was
never
intended
to
be
in
the
first
place
outside
the
box
bottle
poured
a
black
color
ale
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
consists
of
roasted
malt
with
dry
bitter
notes
with
some
citrus
hoppy
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
dry
bitter
roasted
malt
notes
with
some
light
spicy
rye
notes
with
some
hoppy
citrus
notes
body
is
a
bit
light
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
not
bad
but
not
great
either
and
not
sure
i
could
have
said
this
was
a
kolsch
had
it
not
been
mentioned
on
the
label
4
5
d
this
shouldnt
work
but
it
does
i
hope
this
sticks
around
b
o
cool
beer
very
creative
style
and
nice
flavor
feeling
adventurous
thought
i
try
it
the
best
way
i
could
describe
it
smells
like
a
porter
but
drinks
like
the
lightest
porter
you
ever
had
certainly
the
darkest
kolsch
ive
seen
aroma
is
dominated
by
roast
malt
coffee
grounds
dark
chocolate
and
nutty
deeply
roasted
notes
flavor
reveals
a
base
of
kolsch
yeast
fruitiness
which
becomes
roasty
mid
palate
turning
nutty
and
fairly
bitter
at
the
smoky
finish
more
bitter
than
i
prefer
but
the
kolsch
yeast
does
shine
dark
dark
hoppyish
coffee
swoon
its
a
good
homebrew
recipe
that
stone
has
done
justice
to
but
i
would
like
to
see
more
justice
with
the
kolsch
style
because
being
dark
and
not
from
cologne
are
two
strikes
i
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
dark
rye
kolsch
style
of
beers
if
such
a
thing
exists
outside
of
this
one
but
its
not
a
bad
outing
while
its
not
overly
impressive
its
tasty
enough
and
while
its
not
exactly
a
summer
refresher
as
far
kolsches
go
its
not
bad
on
a
hot
100degree
summer
texas
day
if
youre
hankering
for
a
dark
beer
you
could
do
worse
the
rye
suggests
it
would
be
better
to
imbibe
in
the
summer
or
fall
but
whatever
good
on
stone
for
trying
this
one
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
very
enjoyable
interesting
and
unusual
beer
the
taste
and
texture
of
the
beer
will
clash
with
your
preconceptions
of
what
a
beer
that
looks
like
this
one
should
taste
and
feel
like
in
a
good
way
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
overall
this
beer
is
really
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
i
liked
it
allot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
hopefully
they
will
re
release
it
at
some
point
i
love
the
nice
toasty
notes
with
hints
of
chocolate
from
the
black
rye
its
not
too
strong
due
to
the
fact
that
its
a
kölsch
style
but
it
does
add
hints
of
spiciness
to
it
to
me
it
drinks
similar
to
a
porter
but
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
a
porter
one
of
my
personal
favorites
it
is
really
hard
to
characterize
this
beer
in
any
way
other
than
good
it
is
an
incredibly
interesting
mix
of
the
dark
roast
maltiness
of
something
like
a
stout
or
more
accurately
a
schwarzbier
since
its
a
lager
with
the
slight
hop
bite
of
a
kölsch
and
the
mild
spiciness
from
the
rye
these
characteristics
altogether
render
a
very
complex
and
strongly
flavorful
yet
incredibly
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
easily
down
pints
of
in
a
pub
all
day
or
at
least
at
lunchtime
with
a
ploughmans
or
sandwich
its
dark
its
germanadjacent
and
it
tires
more
quickly
than
i
might
have
initially
thought
yup
thats
sprockets
for
me
from
what
i
can
recall
calling
this
a
kolsch
is
sort
of
disingenuous
at
best
as
all
the
light
crisp
and
easydrinking
qualities
of
that
style
are
shit
all
over
by
this
venture
see
american
black
ales
for
precedence
o
i
like
it
it
seems
a
little
schizo
as
far
as
its
style
identity
but
its
an
example
of
pushing
the
creative
envelope
and
the
guys
at
stone
definitely
make
it
work
aroma
is
dominated
by
roasty
malts
with
hints
of
breadiness
and
minerals
lots
of
roast
on
the
palate
with
some
spicy
rye
and
little
smoky
char
at
the
finish
would
not
have
called
this
a
kolsch
tasted
blind
but
this
was
damn
good
o
it
reminds
me
of
a
black
ipa
without
the
bitter
hops
its
a
mixture
of
sweet
caramel
sweet
citrus
roasted
malts
and
some
dark
sugars
it
is
a
real
nice
blend
that
has
a
dark
sugars
and
refreshing
grains
definitely
worth
a
pickup
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
totally
unique
but
very
tasty
glad
i
had
an
opportunity
to
try
this
poured
a
rich
opaque
black
with
brown
highlights
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
when
held
to
light
two
and
a
half
fingers
of
tan
head
that
grew
as
it
sat
and
left
abundant
lacing
down
the
glass
a
very
nice
looking
beer
similar
in
appearance
to
a
stout
scents
of
rich
roast
malt
dark
chocolate
coffee
with
a
bit
of
cream
a
bit
of
a
pretzellike
aroma
hints
of
grassy
hops
along
with
spicy
rye
in
the
background
as
it
sits
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
comes
into
the
foreground
as
is
common
in
the
kolsch
style
a
very
nice
aroma
profile
that
is
an
interesting
combination
of
a
porter
a
rye
beer
and
a
kolsch
flavor
begins
with
a
roasted
flavor
malt
profile
with
notes
of
black
coffee
and
rye
this
moves
into
further
roasted
flavors
with
notes
of
burnt
toast
black
coffee
and
roast
malt
and
a
hint
of
fruitiness
that
is
very
faint
finish
is
dry
with
roast
malt
spicy
rye
black
coffee
and
a
slight
tang
with
some
fruitiness
faintly
detectable
aftertaste
is
dry
with
a
strong
roast
malt
presence
and
hints
of
black
coffee
an
interesting
flavor
profile
that
tastes
very
similar
to
a
porter
or
stout
and
is
quite
removed
from
a
kolsch
it
is
quite
nice
and
the
addition
of
rye
adds
a
nice
spice
and
nuttiness
to
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderatehigh
carbonation
and
a
smooth
creamy
feel
very
nice
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
as
a
result
overall
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
it
has
a
nice
aroma
and
flavor
that
are
more
reminiscent
of
a
porter
than
a
kolsch
with
the
nice
spiciness
that
rye
imparts
an
extremely
drinkable
mouthfeel
aids
the
beer
and
makes
it
quite
the
sessionable
offering
very
well
done
and
unique
to
boot
the
aftertaste
is
a
nice
lingering
goodness
i
highly
recommend
this
great
beer
get
it
while
you
can
overall
easy
to
drink
and
unusual
for
a
stone
brew
serving
temp
and
glass
choice
are
very
important
o
better
than
expected
great
rye
flavor
mixed
with
light
german
lager
pretty
unique
and
definitely
delicious
overall
this
just
about
works
really
well
strong
points
are
the
nice
rye
kick
the
drinkability
i
would
never
hesitate
to
have
another
not
only
that
i
think
breweries
should
abandon
the
mostly
failed
black
ipa
go
after
the
black
rye
category
i
see
potential
good
beer
overall
a
delicious
and
very
enjoyable
beer
it
reminded
me
at
times
of
a
porter
or
a
black
lager
i
will
be
buying
this
again
if
there
is
any
left
stone
you
do
not
have
to
release
every
beer
that
every
employee
thinks
of
your
special
beers
are
starting
to
stop
being
special
overall
a
pretty
solid
twist
on
the

this
5
4
sprocket
beer
labeled
as
a
black
rye
kolsch
proves
it
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
light
but
has
some
meatier
flavors
interesting
o
it
tastes
good
but
what
the
hell
is
it
not
a
kolsch
id
drink
it
again
but
cannot
think
of
it
as
a
kolsch
o
this
is
definitely
an
experiment
of
a
beer
it
has
its
good
points
but
doesnt
come
off
altogether
eric
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
this
is
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
is
very
faint
just
some
lightly
toasty
black
patent
scent
nice
taste
but
i
dont
get
anything
more
than
dark
lightly
roasted
malt
maybe
with
a
little
toffee
blind
tasting
id
just
call
it
a
stout
and
move
on
its
not
bad
but
a
black
rye
kolsch
sounds
gmimicky
overall
a
decently
charred
and
toasty
tasting
brew
with
a
lighter
palate
and
easy
drinking
feel
a
pretty
nice
kolsh
o
dont
know
if
this
will
ever
return
due
to
spotlight
series
status
but
if
it
does
it
could
become
my
go
to
beer
during
its
release
o
so
many
great
flavors
and
so
drinkable
especially
for
a
heavier
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
this
beer
is

it
is
good

i
like
this
beer
more
than
i
would
consider
it
authentic
im
not
trying
to
kill
it
overall
but
my
score
is
compromised
based
on
execution
to
style
this
is
nothing
like
a
kölsch
and
i
dont
get
why
a
rather
specific
historic
style
should
be
used
as
a
catchall
category
like
american
black
ale
where
this
would
fit
with
the
whacky
recipe
but
this
is
so
strongly
rye
flavored
why
do
we
have
a
rye
beer
category
if
its
not
used
for
stuff
like
this
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
trader

light

a

with
a

the
dries
up
almost
clean
not
a

a

beer
that
was

extremely
flavorful
easy

ale
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
schwarzbier
and
a
black
ipa
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
works
better
as
a
black
ipaor
hell
even
a
porter
than
a
kolsch
drinkable
enough
stone
is
starting
to
get
a
little
out
there
but
i
like
they
are
still
trying
to
push
some
boundries
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
not
really
buying
the
concept
of
a
black
rye
kolsch
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
sessionable
beer
roasted
rye
i
cant
say
that
ive
had
a
beer
in
a
bomber
go
down
this
easily
before
and
its
been
a
while
since
i
polished
off
something
that
big
in
such
short
a
time
this
reminded
me
of
a
porter
in
so
may
ways
but
its
a
testament
to
stone
that
they
brewed
a
kolsch
and
had
me
thinking
that
it
was
something
else
the
carbonation
was
present
enough
to
make
this
light
like
the
idea
behind
this
beer
this
was
a
goodnatured
beer
that
was
easygoing
from
start
to
finish
and
unlike
anything
else
that
ive
ever
had
before
props
to
stone
for
pushing
the
edge
and
giving
me
a
new
appreciate
for
what
a
kolsch
is
capable
of
being
this
was
just
a
pretty
good
beer
i
was
even
a
bit
surprised
as
i
wasnt
expecting
much
overall
fairly
satisfying
yes
i
understand
this
a
tinkeredwith
augmented
kolsch
but
i
hoped
that
didnt
mean
totally
tossing
out
the
refreshing
spirit
of
the
beer
out
the
window
thankfully
while
there
is
a
little
added
heft
it
remains
nicely
drinkable
really
im
just
happy
it
didnt
wander
into
unrefreshing
territory
the
flavors
of
a
schwarzbier
with
the
feel
of
a
kolsch
neat
the
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
kolsch
quality
without
so
much
stone
quality
in
the
back
however
still
very
flavorful
for
the
abv
and
well
crafted
i
hope
to
see
more
offerings
like
this
from
stone
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
but
not
one
i
see
myself
seeking
out
again
they
might
have
some
success
marketing
this
as
a
dark
beer
for
the
summertime
as
its
fairly
refreshing
and
sessionable
overall
not
bad
not
very
kolsch
like
as
its
a
bit
too
heavy
but
it
does
bring
a
little
schwarzbier
like
notes
which
is
lager
like
and
an
attempt
at
a
dark
kolsch
nice
malts
with
roast
hint
of
choc
and
smoke
nice
overall
though
pretty
tasty

drinkable

o
an
interesting
twist
a
black
rye
kolsch
definitely
an
a
for
originality
its
very
drinkable
and
tasty
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
black
ale
the
taste
combinations
are
distinctive
and
pretty
well
balanced
with
each
other
yet
a
tad
subdued
as
far
as
the
rye
component
goes
i
first
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
bbq
joint
and
wasnt
quite
as
impressed
with
it
but
this
particular
bottle
was
worth
the
second
go
round
i
certainly
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
another
when
a
dark
ale
style
like
a
black
ipa
or
cascadian
dark
ale
is
what
im
craving
overall
decent
much
like
a
waterdown
porter
with
the
roasty
malts
and
chocolate
a
little
light
and
rather
easy
on
the
mouth
seems
like
a
black
rye
kolsch
is
just
a
fancy
title
to
sell
this
beer

i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
of
this
being
a
black
kolsch
style
ale
but
since
its
stone
i
will
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
dark
black
color
looks
like
a
stout
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
chocolate
spice
really
not
bad
at
all
nice
flavor
really
flavorful
dark
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
i
didnt
pick
up
too
much
rye
in
the
flavor
but
this
was
a
good
beer
i
dont
know
how
it
relates
back
to
things
like
sunner
or
reissdorf
but
its
good
this
one
off
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
gives
way
to
a
nice
film
and
lacing
the
nose
is
a
very
subtle
blend
of
coffee
roasted
malt
and
sweet
european
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
for
such
a
dark
beer
it
drinks
very
smooth
and
easy
like
a
great
dark
session
ale
the
flavor
is
more
complex
than
the
nose
there
are
notes
of
coffee
noble
hops
and
smoke
intermingled
with
the
sweetness
of
roasted
malts
and
european
yeast
this
is
a
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
with
unexpected
complexities
not
my
favorite
beer
or
style
but
very
well
done
a
nice
session
ale
that
pairs
well
with
pork
loin
grilled
with
herbs
the
char
on
the
loin
works
well
with
the
richer
darker
notes
and
the
herbs
and
leanness
of
the
meat
compliments
the
fruit
and
bread
aspects
given
this
is
a
stone
product
it
is
interesting
to
not
comment
heavily
on
the
hop
bill
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
gorgeously
thick
frothy
head
smooth
pleasant
aromas
of
nutty
chocolate
grassy
hops
light
rye
bread
and
sweetened
coffee
with
some
very
light
char
permeating
everything
malty
flavor
dry
nutty
and
clean
bready
roast
with
some
tasty
fruity
spice
in
the
middle
finishing
a
little
bitter
some
citrus
and
herbs
to
brighten
things
up
light
creamy
and
appropriately
dry
about
what
i
expected
a
well
made
experimental
beer
that
stays
drinkable
and
doesnt
try
to
be
extreme
beyond
doing
a
bit
of
style
blending
overall
really
quite
wonderful
stuff
this
is
interesting
and
unusual
but
done
with
such
conviction
and
integration
of
flavours
that
it
seems
classic
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
not
fantastic
but
very
well
done
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
seemed
like
a
bunch
of
styles
mixed
together
but
the
out
come
is
pretty
good
the
smel
has
a
bit
of
smoke
with
some
nuttiness
the
color
is
pretty
close
to
opaque
black
you
can
see
a
slight
copper
color
held
up
the
light
the
taste
is
nutty
not
nearly
as
strong
as
you
would
expect
from
the
color
slightly
bitter
but
surprisingly
drinkable
it
has
basically
a
black
color
but
brown
hints
around
the
edges
it
had
a
minimal
offwhite
head
and
no
real
lacing
beautiful
rye
and
hoppy
scent
a
bit
of
a
metallic
scent
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
slightly
roasted
background
and
hoppy
finish
not
heavy
cloying
or
bitter
best
description
is
sublimely
selfrighteous
lite
like
others
have
voiced
not
how
i
expected
it
to
taste
given
the
style
compared
to
others
ive
had
but
a
decent
brew
medium
on
the
mouthfeel
and
overall
a
decent
brew
this
beer
is
innovative
and
a
nice
take
on
the
style
with
a
new
spin
overall
this
beer
was
extremely
drinkable
and
was
clean
from
start
to
finish
not
what
youd
expect
from
drinking
a
kolsch
but
i
give
it
to
them
for
being
innovative
was
refreshing
to
drink
a
stone
beer
without
the
typical
stone
hop
profile
that
all
of
there
beers
seem
to
have
45
worth
picking
up
for
sure
a
little
pricey
imho
pours
a
black
color
12
inch
head
of
a

color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
dark
citrus
slight
spice
dry
hop
hint
of
pepper
and
hint
of
rye
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
well
blended
beer
but
i
dont
believe
it
fits
the
category
of
a
kolsch
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
spice
hint
of
rye
dry
hops
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
overall
great
appearance
good
aroma
body
and
blend
no
complaints
about
this
beer
except
for
it
being
a
poor
representation
of
a
kolsch
the
low
score
is
due
to
rating
the
beer
under
kolsch
style
characteristics
poured
into
a
sester
stange
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
hints
of
red
at
the
margins
and
a

finger

brown
head
with

retention
and
heavy
lacing

bready
and
toasted

with

finishes
with
nice
lightly
charred
toasted
malt
spicy
rye
and
light
grassy
hops
light
to
medium
bodied
with
peppery
carbonation
flavors
are
quite
nice
but
somewhat
subdued
as
expected
from
a
kolsch
style
session
beer
but
with
a
surprisingly
robust
finish
except
that
the
flavors
are
toned
down
this
doesnt
fit
much
with
the
light
kolsch
style
perhaps
only
because
no
one
had
thought
to
put
a
rich
toasted
malt
and
rye
in
one
before
it
delivers
on
its
name
a
black
rye
ale
that
has
been
toned
down
to
kolsch
sessionability
without
losing
its
character
interesting
and
well
done
the
first
80
degree
day
here
this
year
and
this
is
a
wonderful
accompaniment
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
blackish
coloring
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
filmy
clingy
low
profile
tan
head
aromas
of
dark
roast
coffee
subtle
chocolate
notes
char
toasted
grains
and
some
earthy
tones
flavors
are
roasted
forward
with
hints
of
smoke
and
char
throughout
solid
coffee
notes
throughout
too
with
some
chocolate
highlights
and
smooth
toasted
backbone
this
tips
the
scales
towards
the
bitter
side
with
a
roasted
and
smoky
aftertaste
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
with
a
bitter
and
smoked
linger
interesting
brew
this
comes
off
like
a
very
watered
down
porter
and
it
has
no
kolsch
character
that
i
can
discern
so
it
just
comes
off
as
just
a
light
drinkable
roasty
beer
with
an
odd
hop
quality
that
doesnt
match
to
style
its
clash
of
flavors
and
feel
just
doesnt
draw
me
in
nothing
seems
to
compliment
and
while
not
offensive
and
easy
drinkable
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
o
definitely
wouldnt
call
this
a
kölsch
as
it
has
much
more
of
the
black
and
rye
ale
characteristics
than
the
kölsch
its
a
very
well
done
hybrid
of
the
three
styles
though
definitely
easy
to
drink
while
providing
lots
of
different
and
interesting
flavors
that
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
surprisingly
refreshing
as
well
pick
some
up
for
a
gamechanger
overall
i
get
it
theres
some
kolsch
characteristics
with
a
lot
of
darker
fruit
and
tobacco
accents
its
different
and
interesting
and
certainly
glad
that
i
gave
it
a
shot
thanks
to
stone
as
well
as
rick
and
robbie
for
a
change
of
pace
and
a
unique
brew
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
bit
more
of
a
kolsch
flavor
profile
but
the
prominent
dark
malt
bill
resinous
hops
and
subtle
spice
make
it
feel
more
like
an
experimental
aba
strong
hop
presence
with
sticky
hop
oils
earthy
pine
needle
grass
and
spruce
tip
flavor
that
linger
throughout
into
a
bone
dry
finish
slightly
acrid
but
the
roast
isnt
as
extreme
as
in
the
nose
hints
of
charcoal
burnt
toast
coffee
grounds
and
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
countered
by
sweeter
malt
flavors
and
faint
spicy
rye
again
the
rye
is
subtle
but
it
nicely
compliments
the
earthy
hop
bitterness
decent
balance
with
low
abv
and
light
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
but
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
overall
i
dont
go
for
stone
often
but
this
one
sounded
very
interesting
and
id
say
its
a
pretty
good
not
great
but
it
does
a
good
job
at
what
it
says
id
prefer
the
dark
malts
to
aim
more
at
chocolate
rather
than
char
and
espresso
just
a
step
down
from
being
a
great
experimental
beer
o
interesting
kolsch
very
tasty
lots
of
rye
and
lots
of
roasted
malt
character
especially
impressive
given
the
meager
strength
of
this
brew
complex
and
well
balanced
drinkable
i
enjoy
all
things
rye
and
all
things
roasted
malt
so
im
slightly
biased
but
this
was
still
tasty
and
i
feel
that
they
achieved
exactly
what
they
were
going
for
didnt
really
sense
the
kolsch
style
with
this
but
still
quite
tasty
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
rye
herb
and
char
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
char
herb
and
rye
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
quite
roasty
and
has
an
interesting
herb
presence
picked
this
up
on
a
sale
yesterday
out
of
curiosity
pours
much
darker
than
i
was
expecting
although
i
was
thinking
more
kolsch
than
rye
going
into
it
with
medium
carbonation
and
foam
that
quickly
dissipates
nothing
much
impressed
me
about
this
except
the
idea
no
surprising
spiciness
from
the
rye
no
outstanding
trademark
kolschness
nothing
overall
seemed
pretty
bland
didnt
check
for
a
bottling
date
to
closely
may
have
been
old
either
way
wont
be
having
again
i
love
this
beer
as
an
imperial
schwarz
bier
or
as
a
dry
porter
those
identifiable
flavors
are
alive
and
well
but
i
contend
wheres
the
kolsch
component
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
kind
of
a
malty
almost
coffee
nose
but
i
dont
think
there
is
any
coffee
in
this
one
kind
of
spicy
which
i
like
even
though
its
a
somewhat
robust
flavor
profile
its
still
easy
drinking
i
like
this
its
a
good
beer
even
though
i
dont
consider
it
a
kolsch
though
there
are
some
kolsch
aspects
to
it
that
i
can
pick
up
anyways
i
like
it
overall
this
is
interesting
but
not
worth
the
price
9
04
for
22oz
it
should
also
not
be
classified
as
a
kolsch
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
however
it
comes
across
much
more
as
a
complex
american
rye
black
ale
it
is
not
in
any
way
a
kölsch
i
intended
to
hit
it
for
that
but
the
truth
is
that
name
aside
its
a
very
tasty
beer
opaque
in
body
with
misty
khaki
head
aroma
dark
chocolate
ash
earth
coffee
beans
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
nibs
coffee
some
earth
a
little
burnt
meat
and
cola
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
interesting
flavor
profile
that
shows
restraint
refreshing
in
a
morning
coffee
way
a
dark
rye
kolsch
well
this
is
new
to
me
soft
but
pungent
too
on
the
rye
not
as
peppery
or
as
spicy
but
the
flavor
of
the
grain
is
still
quite
prominent
dark
coffee
colored
beer
with
a
brighter
carbonation
accumulating
an
inch
or
so
of
mocha
colored
head
almost
looks
like
a
nitro
tap
with
the
size
of
these
tiny
bubbles
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
flavors
smell
strong
but
the
yeast
and
the
general
lightness
of
this
dark
brew
are
also
evident
very
clearly
not
a
porter
or
stout
the
flavor
has
all
the
rye
on
the
front
end
which
i
like
and
still
feels
german
enough
on
the
grain
front
for
me
to
accept
this
as
a
kolsch
its
lightness
helps
too
barely
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
extremely
well
the
feel
kind
of
makes
it
for
me
i
like
the
rye
front
loaded
too
so
the
finish
is
still
quick
a
very
flavorful
yet
approachable
beer
for
anyone
looking
to
try
a
little
something
different
22oz
bottle
pours
an
extremely
dark
brownish
black
with
a
12
inch
of
khaki
head
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
earth
chocolate
charcoal
and
some
slight
funk
the
taste
is
a
refreshing
mix
of
chocolate
charcoal
floral
hops
burnt
coffee
and
some
light
rye
chocolate
and
charcoal
towards
the
finish
with
some
floral
hop
notes
and
earth
mouthfeel
is
light
which
surprised
me
a
bit
due
to
the
color
very
little
alcohol
presence
somewhat
nutty
as
it
warms
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
light
and
crisp
like
a
kolsch
but
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
smoke
and
chocolate
almost
reminds
me
of
a
schwarzbier
overall
a
strange
beer
but
i
like
it
and
would
buy
it
again
overall
super
well
balanced
and
really
easy
drinking
if
this
were
cheap
and
in
6
packs
i
would
go
through
a
lot
of
this
really
impressive
a
very
slight
grape
like
quality
with
this
beer
big
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
light
in
flavor
slight
hop
character
overall
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
little
lacing
and
head
a
nice
sweetness
slight
rye
but
not
big
overall
a
fine
beer
and
an
interesting
one
to
describe
sprocket
bier
has
a
lot
going
on
for
it
tastes
like
an
ale
drinks
like
a
lager
interesting
twist
on
a
session
beer
but
it
works
very
well
im
on
my
second
bottle
as
i
type
this
review
definite
summertime
drinker
that
even
dieter
himself
would
approve
of
pours
a
translucent
very
dark
brown
with
billowing
head
of
dense
light
brown
foam
rings
of
thick
lace
on
the
glass
smell
floral
and
slightly
spicy
with
rye
graininess
background
sweetness
and
the
impression
of
coffee
wafting
from
across
a
room
taste
light
sweet
fruit
flavors
upfront
then
a
blip
of
roast
and
toffee
into
a
big
spicy
rye
thing
with
a
vaguely
lemony
finish
light
bodied
upfront
then
really
explodes
silky
feel
far
more
luxurious
than
your
usual
kolsch
dry
finish
very
tasty
should
have
added
as
a
rye
beer
real
interesting
beer
probably
not
what
i
want
in
a
kolsch
but
its
a
real
interesting
style
a
mix
of
light
kolsch
and
sweet
dark
caramel
flavors
overall
hard
to
categorize
this
kmita
kolsch
is
fairly
tasty
and
blindfolded
i
would
have
sworn
this
was
imported
an
odd
ball
beer
i
kind
of
like
it
but
i
really
would
look
elsewhere
for
a
clean
example
of
the
style
o
im
not
quite
sure
what
a
polish
style
kölsch
ale
is
but
this
beer
doesnt
measure
up
to
what
a
kölsch
should
be
if
styles
are
considered
by
no
means
is
it
a
bad
product
in
fact
kmita
kölsch
is
a
very
wellmade
beer
it
just
doesnt
fit
guidelines
id
love
to
know
the
story
behind
this
beer
i
feel
that
it
might
make
the
experience
make
a
little
more
sense
in
the
end
kmita
kölsch
is
drinkable
but
not
as
drinkable
as
a
typical
kölsch
i
have
no
idea
what
a
polish
kölsch
is
supposed
to
be
like
but
this
is
the
darkest
kolsch
i
have
ever
seen
most
brown
ales
arent
this
dark
super
malty
nose
and
tons
on
the
flavor
as
well
smooth
feel
but
quite
thick
this
is
not
really
a
kölsch
so
far
as
i
am
familiar
with
nice
drinker
but
well
outside
the
style
parameters
i
remember
being
so
perplexed
by
the
concept
of
a
polishstyle
kolsch
this
past
summer
that
i
ran
out
to
the
whole
foods
in
lincoln
park
and
grabbed
a
pint
at
their
bar
good
times
lets
have
another
shall
we
this
stuff
pours
a
partly
hazy
copperamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
offcreamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
and
buttery
biscuit
candied
orange
zest
and
a
hint
of
fennel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
tangelo
zest
orange
peel
light
black
pepper
toasted
biscuit
and
a
dash
of
nutmeg
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
creamily
drying
finish
overall
a
tasty
interpretation
of
a
kolsch
even
if
it
bears
only
a
small
resemblance
to
the
base
style
the
fruity
flavor
is
overwhelming
review
is
not
based
on
style
but
personal
preference
overall
i
was
a
little
leery
seeing
a
can
of
carling
black
label
on
the
label
a
solid
beer
this
is
not
what
i
feel
a
traditional
klosch
beer
should
be
like
but
then
again
they
are
claiming
it
is
a
polish
klosch
so
who
am
i
to
argue
i
would
buy
this
one
again
but
since
it
is
on
a
rotating
basis
who
knows
when
i
will
see
it
again
overall
not
good
like
a
somewhat
inexperienced
homebrewer
making
some
mistakes
and
nothing
what
i
would
expect
for
a
kolsch
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
kolsch
as
i
mentioned
more
of
belgianfrench
amber
flavor
profile
with
kolsch
yeast
flavoring
and
drying
presence
in
the
mouth
o
this
beer
is
quite
unlike
any
other
kölsch
ive
had
before
especially
in
its
appearance
and
amount
of
malts
and
dryness
its
also
not
very
easy
to
drink
overall
drinkability
an
unusual
contrast
of
flavors
in
this
beer
not
like
any
kolsch
ive
had
before
glad
i
tried
but
i
could
not
see
myself
having
very
many
glasses
of
this
in
a
sitting
drinkability
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
but
definitely
worth
a
try
i
think
dark
horse
is
a
great
brewery
in
general
but
it
really
swings
on
the
spectrum
with
their
beers
this
is
on
the
lower
end
a
very
easydrinking
and
refreshing
pour
im
not
sure
how
authentic
this
is
to
the
style
its
so
dark
it
doesnt
resemble
any
kolsh
ive
had
but
its
quality
is
beyond
dispute
poured
weirdly
i
didnt
manage
to
break
up
the
flocks
into
finer
light
reflecting
things
and
it
was
darker
than
the
few
of
the
style
ive
had
and
it
seemed
a
bit
not
cool
and
not
inviting
and
like
i
said
weird
i
get
malt
and
biscuit
and
a
bit
of
ripe
fruit
and
maybe
some
floral
notes
again
a
kolsch
tastes
actually
ok
average
or
even
maybe
a
bit
better
not
undrinkable
for
sure
but
i
really
dont
have
much
positive
to
say
about
this
sorry
loving
dh
brews
and
all
i
wonder
if
the
polish
has
something
to
do
with
this
i
dont
recommend
this
my
first
dont
buy
comment
on
a
dark
horse
beer
this
beer
wasnt
awful
but
it
wasnt
very
good
either
and
i
dont
understand
how
this
can
be
labeled
as
a
kolsch
it
resembles
a
kolsch
in
almost
no
way
is
dark
horse
trying
to
play
a
joke
on
us
ill
be
sure
to
pass
this
one
up
next
time
tastes
a
little
fruity
and
toasty
with
a
gently
bitter
aftertaste
if
i
had
this
blindfolded
id
say
it
was
bells
amber
a
great
beer
dried
fruit
and
light
toasty
malt
flavors
light
feel
smooth
and
flavorful
its
a
good
beer
regardless
of
style
craft
beer
is
about
bending
rigid
styles
anyway
dark
horse
could
convince
me
that
kmita
is
a
cream
ale
an
amber
ale
or
even
a
nondescript
pale
ale
but
its
not
a
very
good
beer
and
certainly
not
a
well
made
kolsch
if
youre
reading
this
over
at
dh
please
note
that
im
trying
to
offer
some
honest
feedback
and
you
can
see
from
my
other
reviews
that
i
admire
your
work
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
faint
lager
notes
yet
quite
fresh
in
the
taste
small
caramel
notes
quite
similar
to
a
vienna
lager
quite
smooth
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dryness
and
light
caramel
roast
in
the
aftertaste
it
was
more
a
vienna
lager
than
a
kolsch
but
it
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
notes
well
its
not
to
bad
the
light
dry
finish
does
add
a
nice
touch

overall
this
is
an
ok
brew
definitely
not
a
kolsch
but
has
some
decent
flavor
and
balance
pretty
enjoyable
not
very
refreshing
not
very
kolschy
not
very
good
in
the
future
ill
avoid
this
one
like
it
was
made
by
white
birch
oas
the
beer
warms
the
flavors
no
longer
mix
as
well
and
the
butterybread
notes
take
over
and
worsen
the
beer
o
its
noting
like
a
traditional
koelsch
making
it
somewhat
difficult
to
judge
on
astd
ratings
maybe
the
polish
kolsch
is
meant
as
a
joke
that
said
its
a
really
drinkable
beer
full
flavored
while
keeping
a
refreshing
quality
one
of
the
funniest
labels
ive
seen
in
a
while
very
malty
bread
crust
and
cracker
malt
plus
some
gritty
dryness
from
the
malt
and
grassy
earthy
polish
hops
sweet
dry
and
easy
to
drink
whats
the
deal
with
this
beer
it
drinks
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
but
its
not
much
of
a
kolsch
and
im
dinging
it
for
style
there
are
far
worse
beers
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
like
any
kolsch
i
have
ever
had
is
more
like
an
amber
nonetheless
not
something
i
would
really
seek
out
again
12oz
bottle
pours
a
ruddy
amber
color
with
a
very
thin
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
very
quickly
i
was
expecting
a
golden
color
for
the
style
aromas
are
malty
grain
caramel
slightly
medicinal
tastes
are
again
malty
with
grain
caramel
slight
spice
slightly
medicinal
would
pair
well
with
a
spicy
sausage
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
decent
carbonation
overall
i
found
this
to
be
weird
ive
never
heard
of
a
polish
kolsch
but
for
a
german
kolsch
this
was
way
off
the
mark
for
the
style
polish
amber
might
have
been
received
better
sorry
passing
on
this
one
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
good
example
of
the
style
there
werent
that
many
things
about
this
beer
that
shouted
kolsch
it
would
be
better
if
it
was
just
called
polish
ale
and
they
left
out
the
word
kolsch
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
smooth
and
the
flavors
dont
hold
my
interest
as
well
as
they
should
one
is
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
that
the
taste
actually
had
something
that
resembled
a
kolsch
unlike
most
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
how
confusing
it
was
this
beer
just
didnt
seem
to
be
that
cohesive
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
interesting
to
try
but
nothing
i
feel
like
i
have
to
try
its
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
a
classic
kolsch
all
in
all
this
was
one
confusing
beer
that
i
really
dont
understand
but
i
do
appreciate
how
different
this
beer
is
its
always
nice
when
the
guys
at
dark
horse
start
thinking
out
box
but
unfortunately
it
just
doesnt
come
together
as
well
as
it
should
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
vanishes
within
seconds
it
is
very
unappealing
to
look
at
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
it
is
a
pleasant
aroma
but
is
in
no
way
the
aroma
of
a
kolsch
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
again
it
is
actually
quite
enjoyable
but
it
is
not
a
kolsch
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
virtually
no
carbonation
overall
when
i
see
a
style
designation
on
a
beers
label
i
expect
it
to
at
least
vaguely
represent
that
style
i
have
no
idea
what
a
polish
kolsch
is
supposed
to
taste
like
but
i
thought
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
something
similar
to
a
real
kolsch
this
beer
tastes
much
more
like
an
altbier
than
a
kolsch
the
label
is
a
nice
tribute
to
family
heritage
overall
very
well
done
and
i
hope
it
becomes
available
yearround
this
is
a
strange
muddled
beer
to
say
the
least
i
know
it
is
their
version
of
a
kolsch
but
there
is
little
in
this
beer
that
even
remotly
reminds
me
of
a
kolsch
perhaps
they
messed
up
brewing
a
real
kolsch
and
felt
bad
about
dumping
this
mess
and
so
decided
to
label
it
a
polish
kolsch
a
properly
brewed
kolsch
is
anything
but
boring
this
contrasts
to
what
was
written
on
their
six
pack
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
overall
dark
horse
did
pretty
good
at
creating
a
style
of
its
own
for
what
its
worth
the
kolsch
is
clean
and
the
added
tastes
are
pretty
interesting
still
it
doesnt
hold
my
interest
to
gain
a
repeated
purchase
strange
kolsch
hoppy
bitter
toasty
dark
and
strong
maybe
if
it
was
a
pale
ale
2
5
o
more
malt
spice
and
citrus
flavor
than
i
expected
my
buddy
and
i
kept
commenting
on
how
good
it
tasted
worth
seeking
out
certainly
an
odd
beer
and
not
like
anything
else
ive
tried
there
are
some
distinct
german
maybe
polish
notes
but
overall
its
a
wellbalanced
drinkable
amber
kmita
pours
out
kolsch
like
with
a
bronzish
brown
with
a
tint
of
orange
up
to
light
a
nice
amount
of
rising
bubbles
an
off
white
head
that
lasts
till
the
end
with
minimal
lacing
on
the
sides
body
looks
a
tad
bigger
and
darker
in
color
than
most
in
the
style
smell
is
caramel
forward
with
some
light
floral
and
pale
malt
sweeter
with
warming
drink
this
up
quick
taste
is
refreshing
this
bottle
is
super
fresh
and
this
particular
kolsch
delves
into
amber
ale
territory
light
flavor
with
a
caramel
backing
an
earthy
hop
flavor
at
this
fresh
stage
this
is
just
a
bit
bigger
in
all
aspects
than
most
kolsch
beer
and
i
like
the
twist
feel
is
light
with
a
sparky
carb
and
a
refreshing
quick
finish
glad
to
see
new
dark
horse
product
in
the
area
i
am
going
to
come
back
to
this
lighter
medium
body
well
carbonated
crisp
and
smooth
on
the
palate
this
is
a
really
nice
quaffer
perfect
for
the
summer
and
well
balanced
love

black
label
in
the
red
can
i
can
appreciate
the
label
true
to
the
label
this
is
nowhere
near
a
german
kolsch
it
pours
more
of
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
thinner
white
head
atop
aromas
are
much
more
to
style
with
lightly
toasted
grain
and
some
mild
floral
hops
the
flavors
are
not
as
delicate
as
the
style
goes
but
i
really
like
them
with
some
lightly
toasted
grainlight
fruitand
quite
a
shot
of
leafy
hops
in
the
back
endits
pretty
refreshing
like
a
true
kolsch
its
different
and
the
meaning
behind
the
beer
is
pretty
coolsomething
to
drink
while
grilling
or
watching
a
game
this
is
very
simple
but
very
nice
pretty
much
spot
on
for
the
style
something
i
really
enjoyed
and
would
recommend
o
a
nice
lighter
beer
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
creamy
with
some
heft
spiciness
bite
gently
crispness
is
firm
and
the
body
lightens
nicely
as
it
goes
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
pale
crystal
clear
straw
coloring
with
a
frothy
foamy
tall
white
head
aromas
of
toasted
grain
and
very
subtle
bitterness
light
nose
flavors
are
toasted
forward
with
a
bitter
and
slightly
resinous
hops
character
light
slightly
effervesced
body
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
the
aftertaste
is
toasted
slightly
buttered
and
hoppy
big
boss
created
a
new
favorite
summer
beer
of
mine
and
theyll
certainly
be
receiving
my
regular
business
on
that
note
the
race
begins
to
try
all
of
their
seasonals
overall
would
not
have
this
again
its
not
impressive
in
any
way
maybe
better
for
non
craft
beer
drinkers
to
introduce
them
to
something
other
than
bud
light
o
would
not
give
this
high
marks
as
a
kolsh
malt
and
hops
would
be
good
for
a
bitter
but
even
still
would
be
a
little
estery
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
breadiness
taste
is
crisp
hops
floral
notes
some
malts
bitter
at
the
finish
refreshing
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
stretch
not
repulsive
but
definitely
not
even
close
to
something
id
look
for
again
in
the
future
maybe
its
the
style
being
more
of
a
fan
of
malty
dark
beers
however
i
do
enjoy
a
good
pale
ale
from
time
to
time
this
kolsch
was
a
nogo
for
me
o
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
a
nice
flavorful
kolsch
though
perhaps
a
little
lacking
in
hop
presence
i
could
definitely
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
o
i
love
a
good
kolsch
thought
it
is
on
the
cooler
side
this
it
still
hits
the
spot
just
awesome
overall
overall
one
of
the
better
kolsch
beers
i
have
tried
pours
a
clear
rather
wan
straw
yellow
with
a
typical
and
not
persistent
white
head
malty
aroma
is
more
hopeful
though
with
hints
of
apple
butterscotch
and
hops
flavor
is
malty
with
subtle
fruity
and
hoppy
notes
nothing
special
texture
has
below
average
body
and
average
fizz
guess
this
isnt
big
boss
best
or
maybe
my
bottle
came
from
a
bum
batch
o
as
expected
for
style
this
is
not
very
flavorful
or
aromatic
this
kolsch
is
wellbalanced
and
easily
recommended
if
you
like
this
style
it
is
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
over
all
the
brewery
did
justice
to
this
style
of
german
ale
and
during
the
hotter
months
i
feel
this
ale
will
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
drinkability
is
pretty
high
a
light
session
ale
on
the
sweet
side
just
nothing
interesting
o
usually
random
kolsches
are
not
beers
i
expect
to
be
any
good
but
this
was
pretty
decent
too
thin
and
light
there
are
better
kolschstyle
beers
out
there
kind
of
a
strange
one
seems
like
it
would
have
been
alright
but
this
is
pretty
strange
tasting
kolsch
ill
pass
tasted
on
2
different
occasions
from
an
establishment
that
goes
through
alot
of
beer
including
this
one
when
there
is
not
a
lot
of
flavor
to
deal
with
it
ought
to
be
more
pleasing
i
would
not
want
a
big
schooner
of
this
i
wish
it
had
an
interesting
aftertaste
at
least
from
the
bottle
to
a
pils
glass
pours
a
very
light
amber
with
a
light
foamy
head
that
sticks
around
solid
malt
backbone
with
a
little
fruitiness
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
missing
the
creaminess
i
would
expect
finishes
slightly
bitter
after
a
slight
blast
of
hops
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
ale
but
i
question
its
pedigree
as
a
kolsch
overall
a
mildflavorful
tasting
brew
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
d
nice
crisp
beer
with
appropriate
hoppyness
and
more
flavor
than
your
typical
kolsch
very
drinkable
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
good
for
long
days
of
grilling
watching
football
etc
this
is
a
very
excellent
easy
drinking
beer
that
readily
quenches
my
thirst
definitely
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
example
and
one
i
would
definitely
welcome
more
of
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
refreshing
its
much
more
flavorful
than
a
typical
kölsch
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
straw
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
and
earthy
notes
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
earthy
nutty
and
subtle
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
nice
brew
it
was
not
aweinspiring
by
any
means
but
still
good
it
had
a
fairly
weak
aroma
to
it
but
the
flavor
was
pretty
complex
and
refreshing
for
a
kölsch
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
person
coming
to
the
craft
beer
scene
but
not
for
a
diehard
craft
beer
junkie
though
fairly
drinkable
for
those
who
can
deal
with
it
it
could
be
a
session
beer
its
no
wonder
breweries
choose
this
style
frequently
for
their
summer
brew
pretty
delicious
summary
the
beer
is
decent
if
you
stand
it
alone
it
fails
hard
when
you
try
and
call
it
a
kolsch
senator
i
knew
kolsch
and
you
sir
are
no
kolsch
okay
well
maybe
it
is
a
kolsch
but
not
a
particularly
wellexecuted
one
it
missed
on
the
one
key
element
of
a
kolsch
and
that
was
the
mouthfeel
this
is
not
a
beer
i
am
likely
to
try
again
good
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
refreshing
after
a
warm
day
another
winner
from
big
boss
this
was
a
quality
take
on
the
kölschstyle
that
while
not
being
most
flavorful
ive
had
still
brought
enough
to
the
table
to
stay
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
d
easy
to
drink
just
a
little
sweet
that
minimizes
refreshment
my
friend
brought
this
to
me
from
the
brewery
in
raleigh
the
beer
pours
a
straw
pale
yellwo
with
a
small
one
finger
lace
that
doesnt
seem
to
stick
around
for
very
long
there
is
alsol
very
little
cling
to
the
glass
which
makes
it
seem
to
be
a
rather
weak
looking
beer
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
are
light
and
noncommital
i
am
getting
some
of
the
hop
presence
but
rather
weak
in
nature
this
beer
does
finish
with
a
dry
almost
champagne
like
taste
this
is
a
different
tasting
beer
and
not
a
style
i
usally
go
for
but
i
must
admit
the
differences
in
this
beer
are
intriguing
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
on
a
regular
basis
however
with
the
summer
months
approaching
this
is
an
alternative
to
the
usual
fair
and
a
decent
session
beer
offering
surprisingly
flavorful
a
nice
toasty
malty
backbone
with
a
light
floral
hop
flavor
there
is
also
a
mildly
sweet
fruity
flavor
as
well
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbinated
really
quite
nice
drinkability
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
have
had
better
i
will
try
again
maybe
it
was
a
bad
batch
drinkability
enjoyable
and
if
you
dont
mind
the
sweetness
and
lack
of
hops
it
is
a
very
pleasant
drinker

very
easy
to
down
and
it
extremely
light
without
tasting
like
a
horrible
light
beer
quite
impressed
overall
i
think
that
this
is
a
style
that
is
very
much
unappreciated
and
often
overlooked
as
it
does
not
have
that
kick
you
in
the
teeth
kind
of
powerful
flavor
or
appearance
for
that
matter
but
this
beer
would
be
a
good
starter
if
you
are
interested
in
trying
the
style
first
bad
penny
brown
ale
and
now
angry
angel
kolsch
both
are
excellent
and
incredibly
drinkable
examples
of
their
respective
styles
big
boss
may
not
be
the
best
of
the
north
carolina
craft
breweries
but
theyre
on
the
first
page
of
the
leader
board
mouthfeel
is
poppy
and
fizzy
as
well
pretty
high
carbonation
flavor
is
of
roasted
grains
and
biscuits
finishes
very
tame
with
no
lingering
aftertaste
at
all
slight
bitterness
but
not
much
drinkability
is
high
as
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
summer
thirstquencher
not
bad
ill
have
to
check
out
more
of
this
style
im
now
interested
overall
a
servicable
ale
nothing
too
exciting
though
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
well
carbonated
and
crisp
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
kolsch
that
will
please
the
average
beer
drinker
a
good
gateway
beer
to
craftand
a
good
session
beer
as
well
decent
not
great
the
sourness
hurts
this
brew
a
lot
perhaps
an
off
batch
as
with
many
beers
the
solution
is
obviously
to
have
it
again
d
in
warmer
weather
this
is
a
beer
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
i
dont
think
it
would
be
my
first
choice
for
a
lighter
beer
but
its
a
nice
change
from
standard
pale
ales
wheat
beers
and
lagers
d
i
am
pleased
with
this
one
a
solid
ale
that
packs
a
nice
flavor
definitely
underrated
drinkability
very
easy
and
smooth
overall
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
solid
effort
i
look
forward
to
trying
my
bottles
of
their
brown
and
belgian
d
not
too
bad
but
nothing
that
id
find
myself
going
out
for
again
needs
to
have
a
little
more
refreshing
feel
to
be
more
satisfying
tastes
wonderful
wet
is
mild
but
enough
to
carry
notable
hop
flavor
mild
hop
bitter
and
strong
dancing
hop
zing
hop
zing
isnt
quite
as
sharp
as
id
like
but
the
carbonation
sting
steps
in
at
just
the
right
time
in
the
right
way
to
contribute
in
a
pleasing
manner
earthy
hops
countered
by
lemony
could
be

could
be

ive
had
this
a
few
time
at
the
brewery
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
actually
enjoyed
this
out
of
the
bottle
a
little
more
12oz
brown
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
of

has
a

ok
longevity
and
decent

not
a
ton
of
aroma
but
honey
and
rich
malts
come
through
nice
malt
flavors
mixed
with
honey
and
a
touch
of
citrus
hop
flavor
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
come
through
in
the
finish
somewhat
rich
not
a
great
beer
but
quality
made
and
tasty
a
reasonably
flavorful
and
thirst
quenching
brew
nice
tones
of
grainy
malt
and
some
interesting
hops
but
the
star
of
this
show
is
in
the
malt
that
slightly
watery
finish
makes
you
want
to
take
another
pull
and
experience
the
flavor
all
over
again
im
glad
i
tried
this
a
second
time
because
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
on
the
second
round
nothing
wrong
with
this
at
all
easy
drinking
here
i
like
the
flavor
although
i
dont
think
it
is
really
to
style
either
more
caramel
flavors
followed
by
some
sweetness
very
clean
on
the
palate
but
not
overly
dry
slightly
watery
and
thin
but
that
is
expected

white
grape
and
some
toasted
grain
flavors
are
much
different
than
expectedwhite
grape
and
a
butteriness
that
i
dont
think
should
have
been
there
but
it
wasnt
all
that
bad
just
not
supposed
to
be
that
way
its
gotta
decent
toasty
cereallike
finish
but
i
cant
get
over
the
butterycaramelly
flavorsthis
is
a
kolsch
style
right
i
can
see
how
this
is
marketed
as
a
summer
brew
it
is
light
not
overcarbonated
and
shows
reasonable
balance
a
biscuit
or
bread
note
is
key
in
the
malt
along
with
medium
hop
bitterness
similar
to
a
lot
of
german
pilsners
but
a
little
more
complex
malt
profile
less
bubbles
and
a
bit
sweeter
in
aftertaste
still
refreshing
and
worth
trying
drinkability
i
could
stand
to
see
more
carbonation
here
but
its
fairly
on
track
for
the
style
but
also
pleasant
tasty
beer
in
its
own
right
taste
is
biscuity
and
dryly
malty
with
a
solid
mineral
element
and
a
nice
dose
of
bittering
hops
the
drink
is
very
dry
throughout
with
an
excellent
crispness
and
a
light
clean
finish
lightbodied
with
nice
carbonation
this
is
a
superb
hot

brew
i
could
drink
all

ill
certainly
pick
up
more
bottles
or
growlers
of
this

biscuity
malts
make
up
the
bulk
of
the

the
taste
is
very

a
light
doughy
sweetness
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
hops
light
bodied
but
not
overly
thin
pleasant
somewhat
dry
finish
very
very
easy
to
drink
as
it

be
well
done
the
flavor
is
really
truly
exceptional
for
the
style
crisp
clean
hoppy
profile
with
a
strong
maltysweet
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
a
bit
thick
for
the
style
but
no
matter
as
the
uppity
carbonation
level
is
perfect
the
bubbles
seem
to
give
some
liveliness
to
the
grainrich
malts
aftertaste
is
hoppy
and
sweet
all
in
all
bb
kolsch
is
a
satisfying
brew
and
at
a
flavorful
4
5
abv
its
definately
one
i
could
drink
all
night
and
not
lose
interest
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
was
impressed
with
the
take
on
the
style
that
in
my
mnd
very
few
do
well
good
job
bb
served
a
nice
crisp
dark
gold
with
very
little
head
that
quickly
diminishes
the
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
malts
and
very
mild
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
slight
untertoned
citrus
coming
from
the
hops
very
nice
complement
to
the
sweet
bready
malts
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
is
certainly
refreshing
this
one
is
enjoyable
and
one
of
the
best
ones
of
this
style
ive
had
if
we
are
rating
beers
within
their
style
then
since
this
is
one
of
the
most
highly
rated
kolsch
beers
wouldnt
it
be
good
for
at
least
a

nobody
appreciates
a

thats
only
4

abv
anymore
its
not
extreme
enough
phooey
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
ill
have
another
please
and
then
maybe
another
after
that
i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
it
poured
a
straw
yellow
the
aroma
was
floral
and
almost
soapy
nice
clean
smooth
and
refreshing
taste
and
feel
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
something
that
would
hit
the
spot
for
wetting
the
palate
a
hot
summer
day
andor
session
brew
i
did
not
like
it
as
much
as
reissdorf
kolsch
but
will
still
get
it
again
probably
this
is
just
not
my
style
i
honestly
dont
think
its
better
than
any
other
mild
lagers
out
there
even
a
little
bit
skunky
which
i
really
did
not
expect

and

at

poured
with

that
quickly
dissipated
light
to
medium
body
with
crisp
medium
carbonation
through
the

and
a

near
the
finish
pilsner
malt
flavor
is
dominant
with
light

bitterness
near
the
finish
that
provides
a
pleasant
balance
crisp
dry
finish
with
light
pilsner
and
bready
aftertaste
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
a
nice
example
of
the
style
still
a
tiny
bit
skunky
but
still
really
good

competes
with
the

final
thoughts
at
first
i
didnt
think
this
beer
was
going
to
fare
too
well
but
it
grew
on
me
really
this
seems
to
be
the
measuring
stick
for
kolsch
nothing
bad
but
nothing
exceptional
if
you
havent
had
kolsch
before
id
recommend
this
one
but
its
a
bit
lackluster
for
a
more
dedicated
craft
enthusiast

since
its

it

mediocre
at

possibly

probably
not

it

im
a

for
having
kölschs
served
icy

in

to
maintain
their

otherwise
i
find
myself
in
a
race
against
the

we
all
know
how
that
will
turn
out

look
no

o
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
not
bad
though
part
of
me
is
more
interested
in
kolsch
as
a
type
of
beer
than
im
actually
interested
in
drinking
it
i
think
the
flavors
are
generally
too
subtle
for
my
unrefined
taste
gaffel
is
the
best
ive
had
but
i
still
struggle
to
remember
how
it
tastes
exactly
even
from
just
a
few
hours
ago
crisp
light
with
a
distinct
but
soft
sour
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
for
spring
but
not
something
ill
keep
coming
back
for
i
love
it
o
i
actually
prefer
this
to
the
sünner
kölsch
but
then
that
was
truly
the
most
boring
beer
ive
ever
had
this
is
the
sort
of
drink
id
fancy
on
a
train
journey
or
a
long
haul
flight
when
im
a
bit
parched
overall
great
thirst
quenching
feel
and
is
just
a
little
bit
different
than
many
of
the
beers
available
give
me
a
dom
kölsch
any
day
this
beer
tasted
a
touch
bland
decent
enough
an
ok
although
not
the
best
one
it
is
quite
easy
to
quaff
i
will
say
and
brings
out
a
much
sweeter
flavor
than
i
can
pick
up
on
the
nose
grains
as
well
clean
finish
it
is
what
one
would
expect
from
a
german
koslch
from
germany
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
a
good
representation
of
the
kolsch
style
but
good
and
refreshing
o
this
is
a
nice
kölsch
a
rather
difficult
style
to
fully
appreciate
since
the
complexity
is
almost
suttle
but
this
one
has
all
a
kölsch
should
and
in
a
very
nice
way
no
grassy
or
musty
notes
coming
from
my
glass
very

d
this
is
my
first
introduction
to
the
kolsch
style
and
hopefully
not
my
last
considering
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
grainy
and
minerallike
with
a
long
and
favourable
dryness
this
would
be
ideal
as
an
easytodrink
option
year
round
but
especially
in
the
warmer
patio
weather
months
a
fairly
full
body
with
a
sharp
tangy
carbonation
lose
the
metal
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
kolsch
and
nothing
really
spectacular
a
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
damn
its
difficult
to
judge
a
beer
like
this
according
to
its
actual
accepted
characteristics
lack
of
head
retention
and
lacing
namely
my
hangups
here
gaffel
and
kölsch
for
that
matter
has
a
subtly
in
taste
most
subtle
of
any
german
style
next
to
maybe
german
pilsner
that
will
appeal
to
lager
drinkers
i
just
have
a
feeling
that
better
german
examples
exist
and
that
we
in
the
us
havent
access
to
em
oh
well
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
a
much
bigger
glass
full
of
this
a
nice
blend
of
aroma
and
taste
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
upon
rereview
i
stick
with
my
assessment
a
great
easy
drinking

this
is
a
very
nuanced
beer
if
i
did
not
know
that
this
beer
was
not
brewed
with
lager
yeast
i
could
not
tell
you
from
the
taste
that
it
was
different
than
a
lager
to
me
this
beer
just
tastes
like
an
excellent
lager
taste
levels
are
all
balanced
and
well
established
at
every
level
definitely
recommended
if
you
have
never
had
a
kölsch
as
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
allagash
white
and
seemed
more
like
a
witbier
lots
of
citrus
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
summer
beer
the
rest
a
solid
kolsch
well
balanced
with
a
nice
body
and
fairly
assertive
bitterness
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
the
first
smell
that
is
honestly
overpowering
is
skunk
and
this
isnt
even
a
green
bottle
so
that
is
weird
eventually
this
fades
away
and
i
get
some
maltgrain
grasshay
and
some
light
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
thankfully
no
skunk
flavors
and
is
fairly
sweet
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
after
the
skunk
smell
fades
away
o
very
straightforward
brew
no
frills
sessionable
its
quite
tasty
this
one
has
the
feel
its
light
extremely
crisp
without
being
bracingly
so
and
riding
on
a
constant
moderate
but
not
overwhelming
carbonation
its
how
a
kolsch
should
feel
it
has
a
light
berry
sweetness
theres
a
good
hop
bite
in
the
swallow
short
aftertaste
refreshing
and
light
final
grade
3
68
a
solid
b
grade
there
are
a
lot
of
fizzy
yellow
german
beers
on
the
shelves
of
the
lcbo
a
lot
of
them
are
not
worth
trying
but
a
few
of
them
are
and
i
would
be
comfortable
arguing
that
gaffel
kolsch
falls
firmly
into
the
latter
category
if
only
the
domestic
brewing
giants
could
use
their
ample
expertise
and
bottomless
capital
to
put
out
a
brew
of
this
quality
definitely
worth
a
try
for
any
fan
of
german
lagers
not
a
ton
to
say
about
this
one
light
drinking
beer
with
a
variety
of
differing
flavors
overall
a
great
beer
i
still
prefer
my
homebrew
kolsch
to
this
though
overall
gaffel
kolsch
is
an
excellent
light
option
especially
in
the
summer
months
would
pair
nicely
with
a
pastrami
sandwich
and
frites
or
potato
salad
a
very
good
german
lager
easy
going
refreshing
and
light
pairs
good
with
meals
nothing
unique
or
outstanding
about
it
but
just
a
solid
lager
taste
is
crisp
and
toasty
with
a
pronounced
citrus
hops
snap
at
the
finish
a
light

give
this

going
to
become
a
favorite
of
mine
certainly
its
a
drinkable

but
thats
about
all
you
can
say
about
it
its

to

it
has
a

taste
that
is
wellbalanced
by
a

it
finishes
dry
and
makes
you

to
take
another
swig
smooth
creamy
a
bit
hoppy
and
easily
drinkable
about
everything
youd
want
in
great
koln
beer
such
an
overlooked
style
here
in
the
u
s
and
this
example
is
a
fine
one
drinkable
wellbalanced
and
just
wellmade
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
bready
with
sharp
hops
the
taste
is
a
little
sharper
at
first
than
id
like
with
sharper
grains
and
hops
akin
to
a
pilsner
but
settles
into
the
lingering
bready
finish
i
associate
with
a
good
kolsch
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
otherwise
nice
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
solid
kolsch
thatll
do
when
im
craving
the
style
but
not
my
favourite
my
first
of
this
style
very
easy
to
like
go
gaffel
beeradvocate
lists
the
kölsch
style
as
obscure
but
the
taste
is
anything
but
this
is
not
hugely
different
from
bavarian
lagers
with
the
exception
of
a
slight
fruitiness
maybe
apple
or
grape
i
cant
even
say
its
brewed
like
an
ale
then
lagered
from
what
im
reading
so
there
are
slight
differences
between
kölsch
and
lager
which
makes
it
a
nice
drinking
experience
this
is
the
kind
of
light
dry
grainy
malt
and
hop
combination
that
has
me
saying
hey
i
like
this
let
me
have
another
session
material
here
reissdorf
is
next
if
your
pour
straight
down
the
center
youll
get
a
good
head
and
nice
aroma
an
easy
drinker
not
mindblowing
but
very
solid
a
real
change
of
pace
and
true
to
form
solid
carbonation
mediumlight
bodied
very
clean
finish
refreshing
and
tasty
definite
session
territory
here
not
particularly
interesting
just
a
clean
cold
refresher
that
goes
down
easy
enjoyed
this
draft
version
more
than
the
bottled
kolsch
beers
ive
sampled
perhaps
its
a
freshness
issue
this
one
was
really
vibrant
and
tasty
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
simplistic
and
poundable
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
drinkability
this
would
make
an
okay
session
lager
i
suppose
but
its
not
as
good
as
reissdorf
kölsch
the
apple
flavor
of
the
yeast
only
shows
up
on
the
finish
and
the
hops
just
arent
very
crisp
overall
kind
of
disappointing
theres
nothing
particularly
memorable
about
it
though
it
is
easy
to
drink
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
there
are
other
better
alternatives
out
there
for
about
the
same
price

a

good
for

otherwise
i
am
not
a
fan
a
little
darker
in
color
than
fruh
with
a
tiny
bit
more
bite
to
the
taste
i
guess
it
just
depends
on
ones
mood
whether
gaffel
or
fruh
is
the
1
kolsch
on
the
day
a
little
stronger
smell
for
gaffel
over
fruh
but
not
quite
the
better
overall
close
your
eyes
and
pick
one
cant
go
wrong
with
either
of
them
i
had
no
problems
drinking
it
even
though
im
not
a
huge
kolsch
guy
worth
a
try
if
you
want
to
get
a
taste
of
cologne
an
average
kolsch
in
every
respect
fine
in
a
pinch
but
nothing
id
seek
out
again
gaffel
is
a
great
pickexample
of
the
true
kolsch
style
ive
had
this
both
on
tap
in
the
brewery
in
koln
and
bottled
at
home
i
am
thrilled
its
available
in
the
us
but
make
sure
the
bottles
arent
dusty
some
people
might
not
prefer
this
beer
because
of
the
perception
of
a
session
beer
dont
compare
to
an
american
ale
or
belgian
beer
loaded
with
all
sorts
of
bold
flavors
for
fans
of
german
pils
what
it
is
is
a
clean
tasting
beer
with
a
certain
sweetness
and
earthiness
that
must
be
fresh
and
is
also
best
when
drank
with
the
proper
ritual
drink
it
in
the
stanger
type
glasses
meant
for
pounding
the
beer
down
with
friends
good
times
overall
kolsh
is
an
under
appreciated
style
gaffels
kolsh
is
an
easy
drinker
very
tasty
and
needs
a
better
place
in
the
beer
pantheon
i
wouldnt
say
its
an
goabsolutelyoutofyourwaytofindit
but
if
you
happen
upon
a
bottle
you
must
try
it
it
is
very
much
worth
it
overall
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
but
if
someone
pours
you
a
glass
its
an
easy
drinker
and
a
decent
session
beer
the
smell
and
taste
were
both
very
minimal
there
was
very
light
malting
and
grain
presence
i
didnt
get
anything
else
i
dont
usually
drink
beer
from
a
can
but
with
this
beer
is
was
ok
with
me
great
tasting
to
say
the
least
very
smooth
less
carbonated
and
very
tasty
i
bought
a
6
pack
of
17
oz
and
brought
them
home
to
the
usa
will
do
so
every
month
now
as
im
commuting
back
and
forth
ultra
clear
yellow
color

what
i
expected
probably
around

first
but
disappointingly
instantly
dissipates

like
characteristics

very
clean
and
pleasant
slight
sweetness
and
fruitiness
to
the
yeast
very
simple
but
nice
the
flavor
is
much
more
ale
like
as
compared
to
the
smell
crisp
and
light
like
a
lager
but
fruity
yeast
and
fuller
body
like
an
ale
it
seems
similar
to
an
extra
pale
ale
in
the
us
nothing
is
blowing
my
mind
right
now
but
it
delicious
refreshing
beer
with
no
major
technical
flaws
would
gladly
have
again
the
beer
is
golden
in
color
with
14
of

that
leaves
some
random
lacing
on
the
snifter

inviting

bready

is
a
great
choice
for
a
quaffable

brew
i
would
have
this
again

a

some
spotty

forward
some
light
floral

solid

with
a
touch
of
light

light

nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
it
is
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
and
seems
true
to
style
a
nice
summer
beer
a
great
kolsch
the
only
thing
keeping
this
beer
from
having
a
higher
rating
is
the
fact
that
you
people
dont
have
any
appreciation
for
subtlety
this
is
the
greatest
kolsch
available
in
america
hands
down
i
will
argue
anyone
on
this
fact
until
you
give
up
and
realize
your
foolishness
d
i
guess
several
centuries
of
brewing
this
style
have
given
them
ample
opportunity
to
perfect
their
craft
job
well
done
this
was
great
with
pulled
pork
on
a
hot
sunday
afternoon
out
on
the
deck
drinkability
i
fear
this
bottle
may
have
been
conditioned
poorly
it
doesnt
taste
of
skunk
but
the
metal
flavours
are
extremely
unpleasant
overall
meh
i
dont
feel
the
desire
to
have
this
beer
again
despite
its
provenance
ive
had
much
better
kölsches
than
gaffel
taste
is
with
a
light
bitterness
and
the
beer
feels
a
bit
watery
because
of
the
low
abv
not
a
spectacular
beer
which
you
must
drink
when
you
see
it
overallrefreshing
on
this
hot
day
an
ok
kolsch
not
world
class
but
hits
the
style
notes
fine
and
is
a
passable
version
crisp
and
imminently
drinkable
sliced
apples
and
bread
very
lightly
dry
herbal
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
extra
clean
simple
and
flavorful
simplicity
is
vastly
underrated
these
days
light
carbonation
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
a
few
in
the
hot
july
weather
enjoyed
on
a
hot
afternoon
at
the
keybar
in
new
york
city
served
in
a
tall
glass
this
beer
shows
a
very
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
modest
white
head
and
a
few
specks
of
lace
the
aroma
is
classic
somewhat
thick
cereal
grain
with
a
slight
tasteful
yeast
the
flavor
is
bright
cereal
rice
grain
with
a
hint
of
yeasty
corn
it
has
firm
but
pleasant
carbonation
and
a
crisp
aqueous
feel
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
excellent
summer
refreshment
with
a
little
citrus
hop
that
becomes
evident
at
the
finish
enjoyable
but
nothing
very
different
a
relable
refresher
o
not
great
reminds
me
of
a
macro
brew
a
kolsch
shouldnt
be
loaded
with
flavor
but
i
still
feel
like
this
one
is
falling
short
12

coming

i
am
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
12
oz
bottle
i
will
not
buy
another
it
doesnt
begin
to
resemble
reissdorf

any
way
which
is
a
superior
brew
very

good
use

not
a
bad
brew
probably
wont
spend
3
and
change
on
this
again
but
is
passable
i
cant
hate
on
the
mouthfeel
its
as
light
and
spritzy
as
you
want
a
session
lager
such
as
kolsch
to
be
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
it
other
than
it
fits
the
parameters
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
disappointment
the
city
of
cologne
can
do
much
better
than
submit
gaffel
kolsch
as
a
beer
representative
of
the
city
this
is
outofbalance
and
no
true
competition
to
the
farsuperior
reissdorf
kolsch
like
i
said
it
is
my
first
kölsch
and
it
wont
be
my
last
it
is
a
style
that
every
beer
lover
needs
to
try
i
can
see
fans
of
lagers
and
pilseners
enjoying
this
more
than
us
stout
fans
but
it
has
a
place
on
warm
days
like
today
was
a
nice
kolsch
though
at
11
a
six
pack
i
can
certainly
get
my
kolsch
fix
for
less
d
such
a
good
style
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
kinda
surprised
this
beer
doesnt
have
higher
reviews
o
this
is
not
my
style
however
i
like
to
try
brews
that
are
out
of
character
so
i
am
happy
i
tried
it
however
it
is
too
much
like
the
generic
lagers
pilseners
etc
i
no
longer
drink
and
i
used
to
steal
from
dad
blue
or
50
however
from
what
i
have
read
it
seems
true
to
the
style
and
is
simply
not
my
cup
of
tea
overall
quite
good
slightly
better
than
the
tap
version
and
based
on
what
ive
had
so
far
a
great
kolsch
wholeheartedly
recommend
this
for
someone
trying
to
learn
about
the
style
cant
wait
till
i
can
get
to
cologne
to
drink
some
local
kolsches
cheers
some
malt
and
noticeably
grassy
hops
in
the
nose
taste
is
dominated
by
grassy
hops
has
a
slightly
spicy
bite
that
sets
it
off
some
enjoyable
easy
drinking
not
heavy
handed
but
not
watery
either
subtle
decent
middleoftheroad
brew
strangely
i
like
this
better
out
of
the
bottle
i
think
its
less
gassy
and
what
i
was
served
on
tap
was
a
bit
to
cold
also
to
let
the
flavors
out
d
ive
no
other
koelsch
to
compare
it
to
but
it
seems
to
be
within
style
and
makes
for
a
pleasant
session
or
summer
beer
this
kölsch
wasnt
too
bad
still
an
average
brew
to
me
but
it
was
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
into
it
the
beer
is
a
very
clear
light
yellow
traditional
color
for
this
style
of
beer
the
head
wasnt
overly
large
and
it
dwindled
down
a
after
a
little
while
the
brew
tasted
like
a
mix
of
a
kölsch
and
pilsner
it
was
decent
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
good
for
a
summer
brew
if
youre
not
into
fruit
beers
id
say
right
on
for
the
style
personally
i
think
on
ba
this
style
gets
the
shaft
as
its
certainly
more
subtle
and
reminds
people
of
bmc
type
beers
of
course
its
not
as
complex
as
an
imp
stout
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
good
representation
of
the
style
nice
beer
i
often
wonder
about
the
reviews
foreign
beers
get
i
love
some
belgian
beers
but
i
just
dont
see
much
going
on
in
this
beer
it
kind
of
seems
like
a
german
coors
but
it
has
a
b
average
here
i
am
attracted
to
beer
because
it
can
have
big
rich
palates
it
can
be
big
and
bold
with
hops
or
malts
or
chocolate
etc
so
this
beer
dint
really
do
anything
for
me
gaffels
beer
may
be
a
nice
helles
but
a
kolsch
it
is
not
i
detracted
accordingly
also
the
girlfriend
got
a
beerface
from
this
minus
points
budweiser
with
grapes
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
fine
amount
of
carbonation
had
this
one
in
a
traditional
german
restaurant
along
the
rhine
river
in
koln
served
in
a
0
2
ml
glass
straw
golden
colour
with
white
head
smells
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
the
other
variants
of
kolsch
i
tried
taste
is
like
most
kolsch
beers
with
a
bit
more
dry
finish
very
drinkable
and
pairs
great
with
bratwurst
d
could
drink
a
few
goes
down
smooth
real
good
beer
have
not
have
many
of
this
style
however
i
am
trying
to
experience
more
styles
d
very
drinkable
and
smooth
paired
well
with
buffalo
shrimp
tacos
i
dont
know
if
ill
seek
any
of
this
stuff
out
but
id
probably
get
it
again
if
they
continue
to
carry
it
at
coast
when
fresh
it
was
better
last
month
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
i
didnt
dislike
this
by
any
means
i
just
wasnt
particularly
impressed
it
was
refreshing
but
somewhat
watery
without
much
flavor
its
a
great
session
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
for
that
purpose
drinkability
bitterness
is
definitely
present
in
this
brew
but
not
as
overpowering
as
some
that
ive
sampled
nice
to
have
a
koelsch
again
but
its
not
quite
as
i
remembered
d
like
a
kolsch
should
be
really
crisp
and
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
interesting
beer
like
a
pils
with
a
bit
more
character
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
aroma
is
bready
and
hay
malts
with
a
slight
earthy
scent
taste
is
light
bodied
refreshing
and
a
tad
watery
with
predominantly
bread
and
grass
flavors
sweetness
comes
through
as
well
especially
in
the
finishing
this
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
have
enjoyed
several
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
price
at
just
4
8
alcohol
there
is
very
little
alcoholic
taste
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
other
flavors
its
an
average
brew
not
much
else
to
say
if
you
like
euro
style
lagers
you
might
want
to
try
it
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
small
skunkiness
and
standard
european
lager
kind
of
smells
in
the
taste
a
bitter
hop
a
small
dry
maltiness
and
somewhat
watery
a
small
bite
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
earthiness
in
the
aftertaste
standard
european
lager
but
a
bit
more
watery
than
expected
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
nose
that
is
reminiscent
of
the
pilsener
mouth
fairly
light
with
hints
slightly
salty
which
must
be
certainly
a
powerful
spring
water
high
in
minerals
especially
calcium
a
little
bitterness
is
noted
on
the
finish
slightly
coarse
and
especially
high
in
minerals
high
fermentation
this
kolsch
closely
resembles
a
basic
lager
except
this
powerful
bitterness
probably
mediated
by
the
quality
of
water
used
gaffel
kölsch
came
to
me
looking
pretty
dead
i
mean
pbr
dead
just
a
trace
of
white
lines
on
top
of
a
fairly
adjunct
looking
beer
with
a
gold
color
to
it
smells
included
pale
malt
out
the
ying
yang
grain
and
i
guess
a
fruiting
of
some
kind
that
smelled
off
out
the
gate
tastes
included
everything
i
just
stated
above
except
there
was
no
fruit
no
earthy
hops
can
even
bring
this
one
around
it
really
tasted
like
a
souped
up
american
macro
to
me
i
dont
see
the
appeal
in
this
beer
isnt
it
supposed
to
be
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
anywho
feel
was
bland
watery
and
lifeless
thin
and
dead
drinkability
suffered
but
i
got
through
my
glass
because
im
a
trooper
ill
try
this
again
if
im
ever
in
germany
but
for
now
im
going
to
avoid
this
in
droves
drink
nice
and
drinkable
but
little
boring
tastes
bit
like
a
pilsner
to
me
and
i
get
bored
with
pilsner
too
soon
it
is
more
like
a
pilsner
but
with
a
subtle
tinge
of
apple
i
expected
more
of
an
apple
flavor
but
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
my
advice
is
to
pay
attention
and
learn
to
seek
kolsch
out
it
raised
the
bar
for
easy
sessiondrinking
beers
drinkability
very
drinkable
like
a
good
pils
but
lacking
the
bitterness
that
would
sit
heavy
in
the
stomach
d
good
refreshing
brew
for
a
hot
day
would
have
preferred
it
a
little
colder
and
a
little
more
effervescent
but
i
guess
you
cant
have
everything
drink
a
very
nice
light
and
refreshing
beer
that
stacks
up
to
beaus
kolsch
in
my
opinion
it
has
lots
of
the
same
characteristics
as
beaus
without
the
weird
aftertaste
this
would
go
great
with
some
spicy
food
d
so
refreshing
great
for
nights
in
september
when
dc
is
still
an
unfathomable
95
degrees
exactly
what
i
wanted
and
would
like
to
explore
this
style
more
ill
drink
this
stuff
as
its
not
bad
beer
by
any
means
its
just
not
a
good
kölsch
in
my
opinion
this
beer
marks
the
first
ive
had
for
the
style
i
do
think
that
every
beer
ahs
its
time
and
its
place
and
in
the
hot
months
of
summer
id
say
no
other
style
fits
it
better
from
the
nose
to
the
taste
to
the
feel
everything
spells
refreshment
in
my
case
i
drank
this
in
the
fall
but
i
was
looking
for
something
simple
tonight
and
i
got
exactly
what
i
wanted
taste
is
crisp
apple
lots
of
grain
some
mineral
lightly
bitter
grass
and
herb
green
apple
peel
if
not
too
cold
the
flavours
really
come
through
integreat
and
balance
nicely
with
a
fullbodied
character
lively
and
somewhat
complex
despite
being
light
in
body
and
exceedingly
drinkable
d
could
easily
down
this
whole
growler
in
a
few
minutes
this
beer
is
so
drinkable
that
being
said
this
really
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
feel
it
represents
the
style
well
this
is
the
ladys
favorite
style
so
i
try
a
lot
of
these
and
this
one
really
has
nothing
offensive
about
it
not
too
much
that
blows
me
away
either
however
i
only
know
of
3
true
kölschs
that
we
can
get
in
the
us
so
this
is
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
enjoy
the
style
d
more
complex
flavour
when
compared
to
your
average
lager
but
this
one
didnt
stand
out
all
that
much
to
me
notes
its
delicate
flavor
and
light
texture
and
body
make
it
an
easy
hot
weather
drinker
it
was
ok
in
the
bottle
but
i
would
bet
that
it
is
much
better
fresh
on
tap
in
germany
clear
straw
with
a
nice
billowy
head
nose
is
light
lemon
and
grass
nicely
citric
and
grassy
hop
with
a
bit
of
balancing
sweetness
very
clean
and
a
smooth
body
light
but
without
a
watery
mouthfeel
good
refreshing
summer
session
brew
but
nothing
spectacular
d
this
a
great
example
of
a
kolsch
a
style
thats
intended
to
be
light
and
highly
drinkable
mild
flavors
and
aroma
but
refreshing
nonetheless
quite
drinkable
d
this
is
excellent
if
i
can
get
this
all
summer
long
it
might
replace
my
defacto
lawnchair
standard
beers
like
pilsner
urquell
and
creemore
springs

d
i
did
like
this
beer
while
i
have
not
had
many
kolsch
style
beers
i
prefer
the
reissdorf
kolsch
over
this
one
d
a
good
drinker
this
is
a
good
kolsch
kolsch
seems
to
be
de
rigeur
with
american
brewers
right
now
but
unfortunately
few
seem
to
have
gotten
it
right
heres
an
authentic
one
from
koln
that
provides
a
good
example
for
the
style
d
drinkable
enough
and
thats
not
surprising
for
a
kolsch
yet
it
doesnt
endear
like
beaus
my
only
comparison
an
okay
beer
though
i
probably
wont
buy
again
with
my
late
afternoon
excursion
to
the
ck
winding
down
i
go
for
a
lighter
more
sessionable
brew
to
begin
the
cooloff
it
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
straw
with
a
head
of
thick
white
froth
the
nose
is
composed
of
hoppy
pine
florals
grapefruit
and
what
seems
like
a
very
subtle
caramel
way
the
hell
in
the
back
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
led
by
the
familiar
florals
though
the
fruitiness
is
replaced
by
a
watereddown
bit
o
white
grape
what
is
most
disappointing
is
a
clear
influx
of
chalk
bringing
down
what
would
have
been
a
nice
citrusy
flavor
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
lightly
moderate
carbonation
and
refreshing
watery
feel
were
it
not
for
the
chalkiness
this
wouldnt
be
very
bad
at
all
but
its
presence
bumps
the
whole
brew
down
a
notch
d
this
is
the
only
my
3rd
koln
made
kolsch
ive
had
and
its
arguably
the
best
one
very
good
tasty
malt
flavours
this
would
make
a
great
introductory
beer
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
this
tastes
fresh
in
wood
casks
in
cologne
out
of
the
three
that
i
have
had
this
one
ranks
third
by
a
titch
but
all
three
have
been
impressive
enough
to
make
me
seek
out
more
and
i
cant
help
but
drink
this
and
think
that
it
would
taste
so
much
better
fresh
than
in
a
monthsold
bottle
the
nearest
thing
i
can
tell
about
how
fresh
it
is
or
isnt
is
the
numbers
26
11
10
which
i
assume
is
the
bestby
date
you
really
do
have
to
redefine
words
like
quaffable
and
clean
when
referring
to
kölsch
beers
whether
its
something
to
do
with
the
beers
unique
brewing
process
the
traditions
and
integrity
of
the
regions
brewers
or
some
indefinable
factor
inherent
to
the
style
i
cant
say
but
there
is
definitely
something
that
makes
kölsch
beers
that
much
cleaner
and
more
mindlessly
drinkable
than
arguably
any
other
style
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
humid
day
definitely
a
style
that
i
will
revisit
throughout
the
summer
great
stuff
very
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
a
humid
day
like
today
this
is
pretty
much
what
comes
to
mind
when
i
think
kolsch
quality
product
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
light
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
d
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
somewhat
refreshing
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
but
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
the
next
time
i
want
to
drink
a
beer
from
this
style
picked
this
up
as
part
of
the
summer
seasonal
release
at
the
control
board
in
ontario
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
colour
with
thick
white
head
head
dissipated
but
tons
of
lacing
all
down
the
glass
smells
faintly
of
grassy
hops
taste
is
fairly
light
has
some
hop
bitterness
and
light
bready
malt
very
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
lager
for
a
warm
day
but
not
too
much
excites
me
about
this
beer
probably
wont
buy
again
at
over
3bottle
but
would
if
it
was
cheaper
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
drinkable
kolsch
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
a
great
kolsch
pretty
much
defines
the
style
crisp
delicate
character
subtle
complexity
deeply
quenching
overall
this
beer
reminded
me
more
of
a
pilsener
than
a
kolsch
i
may
give
this
brew
another
shot
or
i
may
not
i
cant
give
you
any
guidance
as
to
whether
you
should
try
it
or
not
beer
is
a
golden
yellow

a
light
head

fresh
aroma
with
a
trace

the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
feel
is
light
with
a
bitter
finish
this
beer
was
enjoyable
kolsch
beers
are
a
nice
change
from
all
the
pilsners
i
normally
drink
while
in
germany
crisp
dry
quaffable
and
refreshing
this
has
a
great
balance
between
grainy
pale
malt
zesty
hops
and
moderate
hop
bitterness
there
are
undertones
of
honey
and
lemon
peel
and
it
finishes
on
a
pleasantly
bitter
note
its
a
simple
beer
but
clean
and
immensely
drinkable
d
great
kolsch
very
light
yet
very
complex
had
this
one
on
tap
at
der
schwarze
kolner
in
brooklyn
unassuming
appearance
without
a
lot
of
aroma
maybe
a
bit
of
an
eggy
or
yeasty
smell
mouthfeel
is
very
very
lightit
goes
down
like
nothing
at
all
the
flavor
is
all
in
the
aftertaste
which
i
didnt
love
its
yeasty
and
a
bit
redolent
of
the
keg
beers
you
had
in
college
i
love
this
brew
one
should
surely
try
one
one
immediately
good
thing
i
didnt
just
gulp
the
rest
after
warming
up
the
flavor
deepens
a
bit
maybe
i
should
savor
this
a
bit
and
enjoy
with
cheese
and
almonds
or
something
there
is
a
lot
better
in
köln
cheers
pours
a
clear
golden
body
with
wellcarbd
head
on
top
of
a
husky
dry
oily
aroma
complete
with
bitter
hops
and
dry
malts
a
dry
beer
that
goes
down
easily
with
mild
citric
hop
bitterness
and
a
tad
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
backbite
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
changes
the
pace
from
heavy
complex
beers
i
am
very
fortunate
to
have
a
store
nearby
that
keeps
extremely
fresh
imports
this
beer
is
not
dated
but
the
bitburger
that
i
got
with
it
is
less
than
3
months
old
so
i
infer
that
this
is
probably
ultrafresh
mouthfeeldrinkability
instantly
effervescent
then
in
a
few
seconds
we
smooth
out
and
lose
most
of
the
interesting
activity
its
got
what
it
takes
to
lift
food
off
the
palate
and
the
low
abv
keeps
it
sessionable
kolsch
is
definitely
not
my
preference
on
brews
i
got
this
in
a
beer
of
the
month
and
it
is
decent
beer
is
thin
and
grainy
some
acid
at
the
back
but
its
not
hops
it
makes
a
semiunpleasant
aftertaste
feeling
a
little
cornish
the
aftertaste
does
not
last
long
fortunately
drinkability
pretty
low
for
a
kolsch
sorry
gaffel
light
bodied
with
some
crisp
light
golden
fruit
notes
a
sweet
pilsner
malt
like
backbone
with
some
grass
and
straw
notes
and
a
crisp
slightly
hoppy
dry
finish
hints
of
apple
and
pear
and
a
bit
of
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
are
decently
balanced
by
the
subtle
hops
easy
drinking
but
not
very
complex
dperfect
after
leaf
raking
beer
if
you
ask
me
this
example
was
a
bit
old
guessing
because
of
the
oxidation
but
not
bad
would
love
to
try
this
in
koln
d
overall
this
is
a
light
drinkable
beer
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
is
worth
a
shot
this
is
very
refreshing
but
id
be
happy
with
just
one
of
those
and
then
move
onto
something
else
pours
a
typical
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
fruity
flavor
is
rather
wan
crisp
and
malty
texture
is
watery
and
thin
just
a
little
tingly
it
leaves
a
thin
finish
that
is
slightly
bitter
but
not
in
a
good
way
for
a
german
beer
it
was
a
disappointment
i
hope
that
i
got
some
from
a
bum
batch
light
body
smooth
dry
clean
and
crisp
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
i
could
drink
these
all
day
especially
during
the
hot
summer
damn
fine
for
the
style
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
beer
especially
if
you
like
a
good
kolsch
very
refreshing
and
as
good
as
i
remembered
a
kolsch
to
be
from
having
a
night
in
cologne
i
could
easily
have
had
another
and
expect
to
drink
this
one
again
given
the
opportunity
a
good
example
of
a
cologne
brewed
kolsch
i
am
starting
to
find
koelsch
sooo
drinkable
massive
head
very
light
translucent
yellow
smells
crisp
some
sweet
toffeelike
malt
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
in
the
flavor
the
hops
take
on
a
grassy
flavor
with
a
short
wave
of
bitterness
followed
by
the
slightly
sweet
bready
malt
that
is
characteristic
of
many
german
lagers
and
then
finishing
a
bit
bitter
again
i
perceive
the
lager
yeast
much
more
than
the
ale
yeast
in
this
one
in
a
blind
tasting
i
would
not
have
been
able
to
pick
it
out
as
a
kolsch
but
then
again
i
have
little
experience
with
the
style
an
average
easy
drinking
beer
with
no
stand
out
flavors
but
no
off
flavors
as
well
d
though
this
was
easy
to
drink
and
tasted
good
enough
to
want
another
it
walked
a
fine
line
between
eurolager
pilsner
and
kolsch
at
times
i
swore
this
tasted
much
like
grolsch
then
other
times
i
was
impressed
by
its
light
grassy
complexity
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
again
but
would
not
go
far
to
seek
out
d
i
dont
have
a
great
knowledge
of
kolsch
beer
in
fact
this
is
my
first
overall
its
a
good
beer
which
most
importantly
i
enjoyed
drinking
and
certainly
would
again
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
no
frills
easy
drinking
just
enough
flavor

not
overly
carbonated
poured
clear
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
smelled
of
wheat
barley

malt
nice
and
crisp
feel
that
tastes
of
a
hops
light
yeast
wheat
and
a
barley
combo
very
light
carbonation
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
average
taste
but
a
very
nice
light
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
and
the
type
i
could
drink
all
day
or
night
a
very
good
summer
beer
notes
a
decent
balance
with
a
good
supporting
cast
yet
i
will
not
look
for
this
one
again
just
seemed
o
k
the
only
ale
i
had
so
far
in
berlin
and
very
good
it
was
at
a
restaurant
that
specilized
in
this
brand
of
kolsch
which
is
typical
in
berlin
the
kegs
were
out
in
the
restaurant
which
added
to
the
ambiance
and
identification
between
place
and
beer
as
always
this
beer
was
very
good
overall
a
good
but
somewhat
average
beer
i
liked
it
but
i
think
this
is
a
style
that
would
probably
benefit
more
from
trying
fresh
from
the
source
this
poured
a
clear
light
gold
nearly
straw
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
hops
and
fresh
barley
malt
with
a
kind
of
funky
sour
yeast
it
tasted
like
light
lemon
hops
and
fresh
barley
with
some
caramel
and
creamy
yeast
it
was
thin
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
didnt
have
a
great
smell
but
it
did
have
a
nice
clean
flavor
the
body
was
thin
but
thats
fitting
for
this
style
and
lent
to
the
beers
overall
super
easiness
to
drink
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
seems
like
a
pretty
solid
example
pretty
refreshing
for
the
summer
ive
always
felt
that
kölsch
is
one
of
those
styles
that
has
to
be
done
right
meaning
that
any
slight
inaccuracy
in
the
brewing
process
will
be
painfully
evident
thankfully

final
thoughts
this
beer
to
me
comes
across
as
a
more
lager
like
kellerbier
the
peppery
taste
is
there
and
amped
up
the
malt
isnt
quite
there
but
the
hops
make
more
of
a
presence
known
all
in
all
this
would
be
great
with
a

time
steak
od
pretty
smooth
and

drink
over

as
i
did
its

of
the

but
doesnt
disgust

overall
this

although
i

after

this
a
nice

ale
for
me
the
graininess
is
too
high
especially
given
that
it
is
meant
to
be
a
kolsch
this
was
my
first
kolsch
and
i
rather
liked
it
worth
a
try
id
say
and
definitely
more
interesting
than
many
other
fizzy
yellow
lagers
that
may
superficially
resemble
it
o
a
tasty
koslch
offering
a
solid

a

weeks

and
this
beer
is
much
better
when
it
is
fresh
as
possible
i
will
revisit
this
though
i
am
sure
overall
never
really
tried
a
lagered
ale
before
so
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
beer
is
very
sweet
and
lots
of
biscuit
malts
coming
through
on
both
the
nose
and
the
palate
lots

earthy
grassy
notes
coming

with
some
mild

flavours
coming

as
well
again
a
very
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
i
kind
of
had
a
feeling
i
should
have
picked
up
some
of
the
650ml
4packs
when
i
had
the
chance
but
thanks
to
the
ocb
summer
discovery
pack
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
ordered
on
a
whim
at
a
nice
restaurant
in
ontario
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
it
arrived
with
a
bright
golden
color
and
a
slightly
fruity
aroma
the
first
sip
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
full
bodied
but
balanced
taste
the
flavor
was
interesting
but
not
distracting
and
it
complemented
the
multicourse
meal
nicely
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
would
definitely
seek
out
in
the
future
as
the
flagship
for
beaus
brewery
i
am
excited
to
try
out
their
other
brews
d
nicely
drinkable
have
had
this
ontap
a
few
times
and
prefer
it
in
that
format
as
it
tastes
much
fresher
looking
forward
to
trying
other
beaus
offerings
good
value
overall
at
about
3
50
per
bomber
and
has
a
rich
satisfying
taste
maybe
a
bit
heavy
as
a
session
beer
but
great
for
12
pints
drink
it
fresh
though
ive
had
some
older
ones
that
werent
nearly
as
good
ooverall
this
was
quite
good
solid
offering
from
beaus
for

i
def
want

this
beer
is
for
someone
who
likes
macro
lager
and
wants
to
try
something
a
little
cleaner
tasting
i
dont
dislike
it
but
there
is
nothing
to
bring
me
back
either

hay
grain
corn
and
faint

taste
is
actually
much
better
than
expected
more
malt
profile
in
the
flavour
and
balanced
quite
well
with
the
yeast
some
bitterness
lingers
but
mainly
grassy
taste
remains
a
lighter
mouthfeel
that
is
dry
one
bottle
will
suffice
perhaps
a
step
up
from
any
macro
lager
but
otherwise
i
wouldnt
reach
for
another
great
looking
custom
bottle
and
labelcap
beaus
got
that
right
at
least
drink
although
this
beer
was
better
on
draft
than
from
the
bottle
i
still
dont
enjoy
the
farm
taste
the
strawhay
notes
really
overpower
the
beer
this
marks
my
first
beer
from
beaus
and
im
quite
impressed
i
think
ive
only
had
three
kolschs
up
to
this
point
and
this
was
by
far
my
favorite
refreshing
crisp
and
easyyyy
drinking
perfect
for
the
months
of
summer
this
may
not
be
the
best
time
to
drink
this
beer
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
worth
a
pick
up
for
sure

into
my
tiny
kolsch
glass
with
a
clear
strawgolden
colour
and
moderate
white
head
aroma
shows
off
fresh
grainy
biscuit
mixed
with
lemon
zest
and
spice
the
biscuit
flavour
dominates
the
taste
at
first
but
quickly
leads
into
a
delicious
fruity
applelike
sweetness
with
just
enough
herbalspicy
hops
to
balance
things
out
it
isnt
intensely
flavourful
or
overly
complex
but
its
everything
i
would
want
from
this
rare
style
grateful
to
have
access
to
fresh
kolsch
all
summer
long
purchased
at
lcbo
two
days
after
bottling
d
extremely
drinkable
very
very
sessionable
has
some
good
characteristics
but
aspects
of
it
seem
really
off
to
my
palate
just
doesnt
work
for
me
nice
looking
bottle
though
not
the
ceramic
version
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
when
the
weather
warms
up
as
it
tastes
incredibly
clean
and
crisp
but
with
that
slightly
fruity
note
that
defines
a
kolsch
like
mt
begbies
canned
version
in
bc
a
well
made
kolsch
is
entirely
welcome
in
my
house
especially
since
no
german
versions
are
sold
in
bc
food
friendly
and
incredibly
drinkable
this
beer
shows
how
a
simple
beer
can
please
as
much
as
a
high
octane
ibu
monster
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
getting
through
the
bomber
of
this
was
no
problem
at
all
ive
passed
it
up
a
few
times
at
the
lcbo
but
i
think
ill
be
back
for
a
sampling
of
that
next
time
im
round
good
highly
drinkable
stuff
and
oh
yea
they
have
a
pretty
quality
kickass
flagship
beer
too
thanks
ritzkiss
for
a
nice
random
beer
that
i
never
would
have
tried
otherwise
this
is
one
of
those
great
beers
that
should
appeal
to
both
craft
and
macro
drinkers
perhaps
something
akin
to
a
boston
lager
its
not
too
far
removed
from
what
macro
drinkers
would
expect
in
a
beer
but
its
done
with
such
a
deft
hand
that
it
will
introduce
them
to
what
even
an
easy
drinking
beer
can
be
capable
of
im
glad
they
went
this
route
rather
than
beginning
with
some
crappy
lager
or
pale
ale
personally
i
would
enjoy
a
little
less
malt
sweetness
on
the
tongue
an
could
use
a
touch
more
acidity
to
get
me
stoked
on
the
style
you
could
easily
pound
pints
of
this
in
the
summer
on
the
patio
at
the
beach
bbqing
perfect
light
summer
beer
overall
this
is
a
hard
style
to
review
for
me
as
it
is
not
the
most
flavorful
of
beer
styles
for
me
anyways
regardless
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
i
love
the
new
4
packs
of
600ml
bottles
that
are
in
the
lcbo
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
macro
crowd
while
still
being
interesting
enough
for
the
beer
geeks
this
is
very
drinkable
would
make
a
great
session
beer
nice
flavourful
simple
brew
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
600ml
bottle
from
the
cooper
street
lcbo
in
toronto
ontario
pours
into
the
stange
a
golden
straw
yellow
with
a
ring
of
white
head
that
persists
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
aroma
and
flavour
are
yeast
sweet
and
grainy
malts
honey
a
bit
of
funk
lemon
grass

and
herbal

and
a
parched
wheat
cereal
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
medium
bodied
with
a
spicy
peppery
bite
and
dry
finish
very
clean
and
refreshing
one
of
the
best
session
beers
in
the
province
great
for
quaffing
on
a
sunny
afternoon
overall
nice
and
crisp
a
perfect
option
on
a
nice
springsummer
afternoon
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
great
beer
to
start
the
evening
with
or
to
have
on
a
hot
day
an
encouraging
flagship
brew
that
only
makes
me
want
to
try
more
from
beaus
an
interesting
enough
lagered
ale
but
not
enough
to
have
another
or
drop
a
macd
on
one
of
those
big
bottles
at
the
lcbo
a
golden
coloured
ale
with
a
fingers
worth
of
fizzy
white
head
the
head
is
poorly
retained
and
leaves
no
lace
behind
smells
like
pils
malt
grass
and
hay
with
a
faint
hint
of
lemon
very
mild
aroma
the
flavour
shows
bread
malt
and
tangy
lemon
with
a
grassy
finish
finishes
dry
with
medium
bitterness
i
have
to
dock
it
for
the
cooked
vegetable
note
that
comes
forward
as
it
warms
its
bad
enough
to
completely
ruin
an
otherwise
fairly
tasty
beer
it
reminds
me
of
the
vegetative
flavour
in
the
nickel
brook
organic
lager
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
feels
crisp
drinks
easy
its
alright
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
it
again
at
eight
dollars
per
750ml
bottle
d
wether
you
are
getting
this
for
the
style
the
beer
or
the
bottle
its
worth
the
cost
its
economical
but
it
doesnt
quite
comply
with
my
tastes
good
beer
none
the
less
a
decent
kolsch
hoppier
than
i
expected
worth
a
try
the
carbonation
was
balanced
and
felt
nice
which
matched
the
chewiness
of
the
beer
nice
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
something
has
to
be
done
about
this
plastic
taste
though
at
almost
8
a
750ml
bottle
its
hard
to
justify
drinking
this
regularly
d
a
good
drinker
drinkability
a
very
simple
beer
perfect
for
that
hot
summer
night
of
relaxing
on
the
porch
i
will
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
more
on
my
travels
a
fantastically
moreish
drinker
very
light
but
satisfying
at
the
same
time
it
has
a
aura
of
a
macro
taste
about
it
but
at
the
same
time
it
reeks
of
quality
a
very
smart
choice
for
a
flagship
beer
in
this
market
as
i
think
those
who
are
used
to
macro
lagers
and
order
this
because
its
local
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
enough
to
make
the
switch
as
someone
stated
earlier
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
now
i
just
need
to
find
out
where
i
can
return
the
bottles
this
is
a
welldone
version
of
a
style
i
find
boring
im
unlikely
to
order
it
again
but
it
will
be
successful
and
rightly
so
its
wellmade
craft
beer
d
easy
drinking
light
but
with
plenty
of
character
would
be
nice
to
session
also
the
bottle
is
cool
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
golden
color
kölsch
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
unrefined
grain
and
weird
dry
ester
is
not
overly
pleasant
taste
is
a
mix
between
rich
medium
sweet
grains
with
again
some
dry
ester
full
body
with
good
carbonation
is
pleasant
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
not
a
style
that
i
am
overly
knowledgeable
about
or
that
i
appreciated
a
whole
lot
but
i
thought
this
was
acceptable
pours
a
golden
lager
colour
the
scent
and
taste
remind
of
some
pilsners
i
have
this
has
lots
of
character
i
like
the
after
taste
a
lot
grassy
and
classy
ive
had
this
on
draft
before
but
surprisingly
im
enjoying
this
more
out
of
the
bottle
it
tastes
a
lot
fresher
the
ceramic
bottle
with
the
rubber
sealed
stopper
is
a
keeper
too
very
nice
mouthfeel
was
spot
on
not
overboard
on
carbonation
this
was
a
great
smooth
drink
a
session
beer
with
flavour
that
stays
true
to
its
continental
roots
good
stuff
impression
a
very
well
made
and
subtly
complex
kolschstyled

soft
flavourful

the
formula
has
been
altered
as
it
should

i
understand
theyve
had
some
consistency
problems
with
this
one
but
a
decent
drink
and
an
underrepresented
style
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
it
was
in
the
flight
clear
crisp
kolsch
with
a
very
mild
hop
finish
sporting
event
beer
on
a
hot
afternoon
slight
flavors
of
fruit
cant
tell
what
though
very
clean
with
no
after
taste
sort
of
like
a
fruitful
heavier
miller
lite
better
than
that
sounds
though
lucky
would
drink
it
overall
very
good
summer
beer
the
flavor
matches
the
smell
although
the
hop
is
more
pronounced
in
the
swallow
the
body
while
rich
for
the
style
is
strongly
cut
by
a
high
carbonation
level
short
aftertaste
lots
of
floral
and
fruity
notes
while
still
covering
that
really
great
hoppy
bitterness
gorgeous
pale
golden
color
and
a
very
nice
light
crisp
taste
with
a
small
but
full
head
the
embodiment
of
what
a
kölsch
should
be
overall
a
genuinely
good
beer
overall
i
guess
its
too
on
par
with
the
style
since
i
found
it
grainy
and
lager
like
not
my
favorite
of
the
night
i
went
to
the
rock
bottom
in
cincinnati
though
because
its
a
chain
i
am
going
to
assume
the
beers
carry
over
the
same
i
ordered
a
flight
of
six
of
their
standard
beers
and
as
i
tried
each
one
i
found
that
each
was
spot
on
to
the
style
the
remarkable
thing
is
how
unremarkable
the
beers
are
dont
get
me
wrong
they
are
well
worth
the
try
and
certainly
above
average
but
they
are
produced
for
a
mass
market
so
as
lazy
as
it
may
be
i
am
going
to
simply
say
that
this
beer
was
a
text
book
example
of
the
style
without
breaking
out
and
setting
itself
above
the
smell
was
lightly
toasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
brought
more
of
the
same
with
hops
to
complement
rather
than
flavor
on
their
own
light
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
this
was
not
the
most
intriguing
of
beers
but
reasonably
well
done
overall
a
very
boring
kolsch
just
not
much
here
this
one
is
way
too
light
even
for
the
style
it
pours
an
almost
clear
watery
yellow
color
with
about
30
seconds
worth
of
white
foam
before
it
goes
flat
the
nose
is
really
understated
as
well
a
touch
of
german
malt
and
some
mineral
heavy
water
is
all
i
really
sense
indeed
no
yeast
or
hops
makes
it
into
the
flavor
profile
and
while
kolsch
is
a
lighter
style
by
nature
it
isnt
supposed
to
be
a
dumbed
down
beer
for
the
light
beer
crowd
thats
what
the
rock
bottom
version
is
and
i
was
disappointed
carbonation
was
a
little
weak
and
the
body
was
just
far
too
thin
it
was
an
easy
mug
to
drain
but
i
derived
very
little
satisfaction
from
this
one
the
first
rock
bottom
beer
that
i
havent
really
enjoyed
i
think
theyve
got
a
good
thing
going
especially
for
a
chain
but
this
kolsch
is
a
let
down
a
pretty
average
but
very
sessionable
ale
pretty
good
paired
with
food
not
so
much
on
its
own
gets
the
job
done
as
a
thirst
quencher
probably
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
this
in
the
future
but
not
a
groundbreaking
experience
o
not
bad
refreshing
fits
well
with
style
o
a
good
kolsch
easy
drinking
and
tasty
pours
a
clear
light
gold
body
with
one
finger
of
white
head
aromas
are
very
subdued
but
reminiscent
of
english
muffins
flavor
is
primarily
grassy
with
light
malts
and
a
lemony
finish
light
body
is
right
on
the
mark
a
great
session
starter
at
rock
bottom
o
this
is
a
really
nice
kolsch
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
and
quite
tasty
nothing
overly
complex
but
well
balanced
overall
this
is
pretty
nice

had
a
bunch
of
terrible
to
mediocre
beer
at
rock
bottom
la
jolla
today
but
this
was
pretty
good
i
think
alien
kolsch
would
be
a
more
appropriate
name
if
little
green
men
ever
landed
in
my
back
yard
knocked
on
my
door
and
asked
me
what
beer
tastes
like
id
drive
them
to
the
west
des
moines
rock
bottom
and
buy
them
pints
of
kolsch
this
is
simple
in
a
good
way
straightforward
very
wellcrafted
beer
a
nice
crisp
beer
still
think
could
be
reduced
in
hop
flavor
a
bit
to
let
fruity
esters
have
a
bit
more
voice
overall
a
good
session
beer
overall
a
fairly
nice
kolsch
nothing
super
extraordinary
but
very
enjoyable
none
the
less
carbonatiion
balanced
to
bring
out
the
taste
and
aroma
for
the
price
this
is
a
great
americanmade
kölsch
its
great
that
a
brewery
as
big
as
gb
is
able
to
deliver
solid
offerings
that
are
wellintended
takes
on
many
of
the
different
regional
styles
of
beer
throughout
germany
i
could
definitely
have
this
again
although
id
want
it
fresher
next
time
good
stuff
through
and
through
always
a
welcome
treat
after
plummeting
through
lots
of
strong
beers
or
a
after
a
bad
day
at
work

fine
example
of
the
style

a

light

didnt
finish
as
dry
as
i
thought
it
would
for
the
style
very
drinkable
and
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
i
had
on
my
visit
this
kölschstrikes
me
as
typical
of
a
lot
of
american
produced
examples
of
the
style
a
bit
too
thick
and
bodied
consistent
sure
but
too
much
on
the
profile
this
seems
a
very
difficult
style
for
american
producers
to
get
close
to
doing
well
on
o
having
just
had
an
amazing
kolsch
a
few
days
ago
i
can
say
this
is
a
less
than
amazing
example
of
the
style
flavors
were
off
putting
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
solid
all
around
definitely
comparable
to
the
few
kölschs
we
get
in
the
us
id
prefer
to
drink
this
from
a
bigger
mug
eine
maß
not
a
bad
kolsch
it
perhaps
is
a
little
more
fruity
than
i
had
expected
but
not
so
much
that
it
keeps
this
from
being
out
of
style
for
me
certainly
at
the
very
least
a
beer
i
am
happy
to
be
sipping
upon
as
i
while
away
a
few
hours
in
the
airport
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
d
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
a
great
session
brew
to
take
to
a
party
for
everyone
to
sip
on
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
12
inch

form
around
the
glass
on
the

down
smell
is
of
grains
and
mustard
seeds
this
is
very
weird
taste
is
of
toasty
grains
citrus
zest
hops
and
a
bitter
metallic
flavor
there
is
a
medicinal
bitterness
that
lingers
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean

this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with

weird

thing
going
on
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
o
not
a
fan
of
this
kolsch
i
dont
find
a

going
on
that
i
enjoy

a
half
of

that
remained
there
for
awhile
smell
was
a
slight
hint
of
honey
but
not
a
strong

elsewhere
very
carbonated
lots
of

but
honey
stood
out
golden
honey
would
be
a
better
way
to
describe
it
good
summmer
beer
and
was
refreshing
ogreat
for
hot
weather
a
good
candidate
for
a
lawnmower
beer
with
its
brilliant
golden
color
and
superb
lacing
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
to
look
at
this
beer
has
a
fresh
grain
aroma
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
is
slightly
floral
from
the
hops
its
crispness
is
spoton
and
holds
the
light

body
together
malty
bready
grassy
and
faint
biscuity
flavors
paint
a
broad
stroke
on
the
palate
moderate
hopping
gives
a
balanced
bitterness
and
a
long
trail
of
herbal
flavor
this
beer
is
a
little
nutty
in
the
dry
finish
super
drinkable
and
loaded
with
flavor
this
brew
is
an
amazing
example
of
its
style
very
nice
beer
on
a
blazing
hot
day
in
mb
and
easily
their
best
offering
pours
a
golden
body
with
minimal
but
frothy
head
with
great
lace
on
a
light
fruity
body
with
pils
malt
smell
lightbodied
dry
pils
malt
taste
yet
a
slightly
sweet
fruit
taste
that
has
some
sugariness
to
it
and
is
balanced
with
a
sour
applepear
fruit
taste
not
a
bad
summer
beer
the
ale
was
served
in
a
variation
of
the
traditional
stange
this
brew
had
a
clear
effervescent
body
with
a
whipped
egg
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
floral
aroma
hops
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
well
balanced
with
the
hop
bitterness
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
the
kolsch
style
very
similar
to
reissdorf
kolsch
i
highly
recommend
this
as
an
alternative
to
the
bmc
brews
for
your
nonba
friends
overall
this
is
a
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
pleasant
certainly
and
perfect
for
summer
not
a
style
i
normally
gravitate
to
but
worth
checking
out
for
something
different
d
this
is
an
okay
kolsch
a
little
more
bland
than
most
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nicely
balanced
malthop
ratio
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
more
good
stuff
from
gordonbiersch
this
is
an
unobtrusive
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
like
most
of
the
beers
from
grodon
biersch
i
have
tried
i
feel
it
would
accompany
food
extremely
well
just
as
all
the
others
have
i
prefer
wits
and
hefeweizens
as
summer
beers
but
i
would
have
this
again
drinkability
boy
i
just
had
a
good
kölsch
as
in
the
new
brew
from
stoudts
i
had
a
few
hours
ago
this
one
well
its
okay
as
in
terms
of
how
was
the
beer
it
was
acceptable
sufficient
even
cant
we
just
leave
it
at
that
light
to
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
and
a
crisp
mouthfeel
not
too
bad
drinkability
is
fairly
high
seems
like
a
decent
summer
beer
this
just
started
popping
up
around
here
recently
by
recently
i
mean
within
the
last
6
months
pours
to
a
clear
yellow
it
is
rather
crisp
and
refreshing
and
has
a
consistency
like
some
kind
of
soda
it
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
citrus
note
it
is
a
good
brew
for
summer
its
got
that
fresh
kind
of
feeling
to
it
well
obviously
it
a
little
dated
but
this
beer
is
pretty
darn
good
on
a
damp
chilly
early
autumn
day
as
well
poured

clear

drinkable

beautiful
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent

greets
you
when
its
brought
to
your
table
a
modest
smell
of
malt
and
a
crisp
refreshing
taste
almost
reminiscent
of
a
helles
beer
but
with
mild
hoppiness
this
is
a
really
nice
session
beer
that
helps
to
while
away
those
long
sultry
weekend
days
with
good
company

a
foamy

upon

nose
had
a
sort
of
a

scent
underlain

yeasty
mustiness
the

was
medium

a
powerful

fantastically
dry

intensely
refreshing
hefe
for
the

no
im
having
more
of
this
there
was
good
lacing
throughout
some
lacing
on
a
light
yellow
pour
very
easy
to
drink
and
light
bodied
and
flavored
low
carbonated
and
almost
seemed
a
bit
flat
at
the
gordon
biersch
brewery
nothing
special
really
and
perhaps
one
of
my
least
favorite
kolsches
ive
had
i
liked
saint
arnold
lawnmower
better
and
also
also
pyramids
curveball
kolsches
better
than
this
i
think
this
kolsch
pours
a
typical
clear
yellowish
gold
aroma
is
hoppy
and
not
strong
flavor
is
fairly
hoppy
pleasing
although
not
complex
a
typical
summertime
brew
light
and
refreshing
with
just
a

o
the
more
i
drank
this
beer
the
more
it
grew
on
me
i
just
had
to
readjust
my
palate
from
the
usual
hopbombs
i
have
it
takes
a
quality
touch
to
make
a
clean
kölsch
and
this
one
is
successful
much
more
impressive
by
the
second
glass
at
first
i
was
afraid
it
was
too
old
but
this
beer
grew
on
me
might
have
been
even
better
in
the
summer
there
i
was
attempting
yet
another
stupid
human
trick
doing
the
inverted
glug
near
the
keyboard
but
the
crack
left
me
anxious
to
begin
the
beguine
the
resulting
two
fingers
of
foamy
french
vanillacolored
head
were
already
fizzing
and
foaming
by
the
time
that
i
sat
the
can
back
down
i
had
low
expectations
for
its
sustainability
and
i
was
not
disappointed
either
as
it
rapidly
fell
to
wisps
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
srm

with
nequality
clarity
and
suddenly
mammon
croesus
and
midas
were
across
from
me
wearing
party
hats
and
shouting
faisons
la
fete
i
had
no
idea
that
those
idiots
were
bilingual
but
lets
party
means
drink
up
to
me
nose
had
a
clean
biscuit
maltiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
biscuitbready
flavor
on
the
tongue
i
did
not
sense
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
then
again
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
style
finish
was
semisweet
so
there
must
have
been
some
hops
in
the
mix
keeping
the
malt
sugars
from
overwhelming
the
beer
i
know
that
it
is
a
summer
beer
which
i
was
drinking
in
early
winter
so
that
makes
me
cansider
what
it
would
be
like
on
a
hot
humid
day
i
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
it
would
be
nice
and
refreshing
tonight
it
just
makes
me
want
to
drink
another
beer
o
i
could
definitely
see
this
being
a
rocksolid
refresher
on
a
warm
day
there
isnt
much
place
for
this
beer
in
my
fridge
right
now
but
give
me
a
couple
friends
100
degree
weather
and
outdoor
work
and
i
guarantee
a
case
of
this
will
get
killed
faster
than
you
can
say
gimme
that
wheelbarrow
ya
jackass
o
this
is
a
nice
american
kolsch
from
blue
mountain
its
straightforwardly
refreshing
and
tasty
while
including
some
unique
character
to
separate
it
from
other
lighter
beer
styles
oa
really
good
light
bodied
but
wellflavored
beer
definitely
could
be
an
easy
drinker
during
the
spring
and
summer
a
nice
refreshing
beer
not
as
exciting
as
the
best
in
class
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
light
and
fairly
crisp
if
you
want
something
light
to
go
with
food
this
is
not
a
bad
choice
it
could
stand
more
in
its
flavor
profile
but
goes
down
easy
not
bad
a
thanks
goes
out
to
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
light
a
tiny
bit
of
malts
not
much
there
taste
is
malts
grains
light
floral
notes
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
seems
like
it
could
use
a
little
hops
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
really
great
representation
of
the
style
flavor
is
a
bit
weak
and
the
grainy
malt
stands
a
bit
out
in
the
flavor
a
bit
cloudy
on
the
pour
minimal
head
pretty
good
flavor
profile
for
an
american
made
kölsch
nice
level
of
sweetness
seems
slightly
thick
in
a
way
that
seems
unfiltered
which
is
reflected
by
the
somewhat
cloudy
tone
of
things
i
like
this
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
to
have
more
than
one
of
o
a
very
nice
kölsch
refreshing
with
nice
flavor
for
a
lighter
style
a
light
germanstyle
ale
indigenous
to
cologne
this
ale
is
treated
like
a
lager
undergoing
extensive
cold
aging
to
produce
a
clean
crisp
beer
german
pilsen
and
vienna
malts
and
hallertau
region
hops
lend
a
balanced
flavor
to
our
lightest
beer
d
i
wish
i
could
pinpoint
this
aromaflavor
but
i
have
to
guess
it
is
not
desired
not
sure
exactly
what
it
is
but
i
know
i
dont
desire
it
i
have
had
this
at
the
source
much
better
than
this
clear
golden
pour
with
an
average
fizzy
white
head
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
kolsch
as
far
as
looks
go
aroma
of
sweet
pale
malts
toasted
grains
distant
grassy
hops
about
the
same
in
the
taste
pale
malts
corn
sugar
toasted
grains
light
grassy
hops
with
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
light
in
body
and
easily
drinkable
but
mainly
for
the
less
adventurous
imbiber
german
kolschy
this
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
nice
refreshing
straight
forward
beer
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
the
lower
abv
refreshing
taste
and
pleasant
flavors
definitely
worth
having
again
and
something
i
could
see
being
easily
sessionable
on
a
warm
summer
evening
sitting
out
on
the
patio
pretty
well
balanced
as
the
beer
is
not
too
sweet
overall
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
a
nicely
flavorful
for
beer
for
the
style
o
overall
i
enjoyed
having
this
crisp
refreshing
beer
that
paired
nicely
with
the
fish
sandwich
lunch
special
as
light
and
easydrinking
as
this
beer
is
i
could
certainly
have
had
a
few
more
while
enjoying
my
time
at
blue
mountain
brewery
at
the
foot
of
the
appalachian
mountains
drinkability
as
with
other
kölsch
this
one
is
great
for
summer
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
light
to
the
belly
sixer
from
wf
arlington
very
well
crafted
kolsch
one
of
the
better
warm
weather
beers
ive
run
across
in
awhile
oi
love
blue
mountain
but
this
is
soso
compared
to
the
other
beers
they
put
out
d
a
pretty
average
kölsch
nothing
really
stood
out
in
the
smell
or
taste
wouldnt
seek
out
again
but
might
give
another
shot
the
body
is
crisp
wet
and
refreshing
perfect
for
this
light
style
the
fruit
comes
through
in
the
flavor
mirroring
this
nose
with
notes
of
granny
smith
apples
honey
white
bread
and
a
grassy
finish
there
was
a
bit
of
a
hop
kick
on
the
back
end
as
well
nice
change
of
pace
good
beer
very
easygoing
mouthfeel
it
all
adds
up
to
one
drinkable
beer
i
am
making
a
mental
note
to
have
more
kolschs
this
summer
very
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
each
sip
leads
naturally
to
the
next
and
the
glass
is
soon
empty
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
another
and
another
i
definitely
will
have
this
one
again
d
an
easy
drinking
brew
and
i
was
really
surprised
at
this
beer
great
beer
for
the
summer
with
light
body
but
good
lagerish
crispness
and
just
the
right
balance
of
graininess
breadiness
and
hops
flavor
excellent
brew
from

this
little
brewery
is
for
sure
vas

and
joy

mouthfeel
that
carries
just
a
touch
of
bitter
in
the
finish
gotta
love
what
the
hallertau
can
do
perfect
for
a
summer
afternoon
this
one
goes
down
way
too
easy
well
executed
just
about
the
best
kolch
style
ive

a
golden
yellow
color
with
shades
of
orange
in
the
middle
large
frothy
white
head
that
fell
slowly
with
good
lacing
looks
great
for
a
kolsch
aroma
is
husky
and
grainy
lightly
herbal
and
grassy
not
much
in
the
way
of
sweetness
taste
is
standard
fare
for
a
lagertype
brew
grainy
malts
some
light
breadiness
hops
are
present
but
way
int
he
background
lightly
malty
and
lightly
hopped
but
nicely
balanced
for
the
flavors
that
are
there
this
is
a
great
summer
drinking
beer
an
easy
one
to
put
down
good
stuff
i
wish
i
had
more
local
drinkable
beers
like
this
one
near
me
i
must
admit
i
dont
gravitate
towards
kolsch
or
kolschstyle
ales
but
having
this
on
tap
and
now
in
a
bottle
has
yet
again
proven
that
open
minds
prevail
this
is
a
solid
easydrinking
straightforward
ale
with
good
ingredients
and
fine
craftsmanship
glad
i
have
some
to
bring
home
drinkability
a
perfect
summer
afternoon
beer
its
thin
and
light
crisp
and
low
in
alcohol
flavor
is
hoppier
than
i
was
expecting
what
a
great
surprise
bitter
grassy
hops
blended
to
nearperfection
with
some
biscuity
malts
and
honey
very
crisp
wellcarbonated
body
that
finished
bitter
and
left
me
refreshed
and
wanting
more
definately
one
of
the
more
solid
kolschs
ive
come
across
had
a
couple
cans
of
this
while
in
charleston
sc
a
solid
very
easy
drinking
beer
citrus
notes
fruity
malts
earthy
malts
grass
oak
spice
and
some
floral
notes
could
crush
a
few
of
these
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
succession
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
in
to
a
tall
fluted
pilsner
glass
pale
and
straw
yellow
with
exceptional
clarity
and
copious
amounts
of
active
carbonation
like
watching
the
aerator
in
a
goldenlit
fish
tank
kind
of
mesmerizing
theres
a
nice
crown
of
soft
white
foam
with
impressive
staying
power
and
scalloped
ridges
a
very
lovely
appearance
the
aroma
is
soft
and
floral
if
a
beer
could
smell
graceful
this
would
be
the
one
the
taste
brings
a
mild
honey
sweetness
with
subtle
balanced
flowery
hops
the
woody
finish
is
clean
and
neat
with
just
a
suggestion
of
dinner
roll
bread
flavor
the
spritzy
biting
carbonation
makes
the
beer
quenching
while
the
balanced
body
adds
to
the
refreshment
this
is
the
best
kolsch
ive
had
to
date
its
simple
delicious
measured
and
crisp
it
just
hits
all
the
right
spots
i
was
ready
to
resign
the
kolsch
category
to
a
poor
lager
imitation
but
this
one
has
renewed
my
hopes
that
there
are
world
class
varieties
out
there
worth
the
distinction
flower
bread
honey
good
hop
bitterness
crisp
good
feel
very
nice
a
classic
golden
german
ale
crisp
with
a
lively
wheat
twang
and
smooth
light
mouthfeel
great
malt
core
with
soft
honeyed
presence
and
a
dry
clean
finish
great
feel
superb
drinkability
this
was
on
tap
at
fleet
landing
in
charleston
sc
and
was
a
perfect
compliment
to
my
fried
okra
calamari
and
especially
the
superb
crabcakes
best
kolsch
ive
had
complex
and
subtle
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
white
soapy
head
and
plenty
of
lace
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
biscuity
nature
as
well
as
hay
and
hop
flowers
in
the
beginning
unknown
citrus
flavors
give
way
to
bread
hay
and
ultimately
hop
bitterness
rounding
out
the
finish
good
bready
malts
crackers
and
herbal
notes
with
a
complimentary
dryness
expected
with
the
style
light
bodied
well
carbonated
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
kolsch
from
south
carolina
brewery
coast
better
than
many
imports
thanks
to
oneeye
for
bringing
back
a
bottle
from
the
piggily
wiggily
in
surfside
beach
sc
all
the
way
to
pa
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
crystalclear
goldenyellow
coloring
with
a
halo
of
bubbly
white
head
nose
of
toasted
grains
wet
hops
and
a
heavy
floral
highlight
flavors
of
biscuit
butter
jasmine
bitter
hops
and
tangy
sweetness
very
balanced
and
clean
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
aftertaste
is
clean
with
hints
of
hops

and
bitterness
great
brew
o
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
remarkable
balanced
complex
refreshing
everything
i
want
in
a
kolsch
the
flavor
is
a
touch
heavy
without
quite
the
same
brightness
i
got
in
the
aroma
but
it
is
still
excellent
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
coast
distributed
it
to
atlanta
pale

pretty

though
honestly
after
a

glasses
now
its
never
really
grabbed
my
attention
all
that
much
cbc
thank
you
hands
down
the
best
kolsch
i
have
ever
tasted
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
superb
lots
of
character
and
so
easy
to
drink
a
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
overall
excellent
clean
kolsch
im
taking
a
bottle
of
this
home
o
ive
had
tons
of
coast
beers
but
have
always
passed
on
this
one
because
i
generally
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
wow
what
a
surprise
this
is
for
a
style
thats
generally
pretty
blah
this
one
is
excellent
a
light
refreshing
beer
thats
also
complex
and
big
on
flavor
this
ones
a
winner
o
very
pleasant
very
balanced
to
me
its
a
great
representation
of
this
style
keeps
me
sipping
would
go
well
with
light
meats
like
chicken
breast
with
mozzerella
o
a
definite
keeper
and
good
quaffer
over
any
longhaul
delicious
enough
to
keep
you
wanting
another
swallow
without
being
overbearing
on
the
palate
overall
a
great
go
at
the
style
a
good
blend
of
flavors
and
has
the
perfect
amount
of
body
for
a
lighter
beer
coast
seems
to
make
some
killer
beers
i
recommend
grabbing
one
if
you
ever
see
it
served
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
golden
yellow
produced
a
large
white
head
featured
excellent
retention
and
left
ample
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
classic
german
style
consisted
of
malted
grain
pear
and
lemon
rind
light
in
body
this
brew
had
an
excellent
smooth
mouthfeel
a
base
of
malted
grain
earthy
grass
and
a
crisp
finish
this
is
a
nice
version
of
the
style
refreshing
great
lawnmower
beer
great
session
beer
o
oh
wow
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
in
my
opinion
i
could
totally
kill
multiple
bombers
of
this
in
an
hours
time
the
drinkability
is
insane
im
gonna
search
this
one
out
in
the
future
from
a
personal
standpoint
pilsners
have
never
struck
much
of
a
chord
with
me
as
i
have
always
found
them
to
be
rather
bland
and
lifeless
this
particular
pils
has
changed
my
mind
entirely
as
it
still
manages
to
encapsulate
the
classic
pils
smells
and
tastes
while
adding
many
layers
of
intricacy
the
nicest
part
about
the
brew
however
is
the
fact
that
it
enhances
whatever
you
may
eat
or
drink
following
the
beer
as
your
palate
is
freshened
and
clear
of
any
distracting
agents
i
will
certainly
have
this
again
happy
i
picked
this
up
when
i
was
in
town
it
seems
to
stand
up
to
its
good
reviews
this
is
an
extremely
pleasant
beer
for
the
summer
season
and
one
i
would
love
to
enjoy
again
o
i
have
to
admit
that
i
am
not
real
familiar
with
this
style
and
my
expectations
were
low
this
offering
from
coast
really
exceeded
them
by
alot
i
am
glad
i
got
two
bottles
so
i
can
enjoy
it
again
later
a
really
good
summer
brew
that
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
do
yourself
a
favor
and
grab
it
overall
this
is
a
great
kolsch
maybe
not
the
best
ive
had
but
absolutely
worth
drinking
ill
be
happy
to
have
this
one
again
cheers
overall
this
lived
up
to
and
even
exceeded
expectations
yum
o
this
is
an
amazingly
balanced
and
tasty
beer
and
is
perfect
for
a
summer
day
you
get
malty
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
refreshing
dryness
and
carbonation
and
a
lower
abv
to
keep
you
going
in
the
heat
as
someone
whos
not
too
crazy
about
weizens
this
is
a
great
alternative
for
a
thirstquencher
kolsch
as
really
become
a
favorite
of
mine
and
this
one
has
as
much
personality
as
a
kolsch
can
have
not
quite
up
to
captain
lawrence
for
me
but
very
close
very
good
and
worthy
of
every
good
rating
it
gets
pours
a
slightlyhazy
pale
gold
with
a
lusciously
thick
bonewhite
head
great
retention
sticky
sip
rings
cling
to
the
glass
the
nose
is
sharp
with
grassy
notes
lemonlime
floral
hops
body
is
effervescent
and
lively
sweet
citrus
flavors
join
arms
with
a
subtle
green
hop
twang
that
is
lipsmackingly
good
this
beer
errs
on
the
mild
side
but
it
is
packed
full
of
flavor
regardless
refreshing
and
tasty
loved
this
one
o
excellent
refreshing
brew
here
would
be
absolutely
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
any
day
solid
taste
with
a
lot
more
flavor
then
most
kolschs
that
i
have
had
winner
o
beginning
to
like
kolschs
more
and
more
another
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
very
golden
with
mustard
hues
very
white
thick
single
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
a
very
attractive
brew
aroma
is
as
buiscutty
as
they
come
with
some
light
bananapineapple
notes
and
grain
mixed
in
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
wheat
and
biscuit
up
front
with
transition
to
a
subtle
spicy
yeast
and
noble
hops
like
finish
honey
notes
arent
there
for
me
light
to
medium
in
body
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
an
excellent
kolsch
which
for
me
are
usually
too
dry
and
bland
whereas
this
one
is
not
overly
dry
and
has
a
traditional
flavor
with
some
additions
to
make
it
more
interesting
overall
real
solid
kolsch
i
am
still
looking
for
the
perfect
one
but
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
boy
would
this
be
good
on
a
hot
day
not
sure
if
this
is
my
favorite
but
real
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
would
have
again
in
an
instant
served
from
tap
into
a
foothills
shaker
poured
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
rye
and
grain
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
gain
fruit
banana
subtle
spices
and
rye
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
had
just
recently
had
a
bottle
of
this
one
that
was
aged
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
the
aged
version
better
than
this
one
while
this
one
was
still
pretty
good
the
rye
component
as
i
saw
it
was
a
little
strong
and
covered
up
a
lot
of
the
more
mellow
flavors
going
on
here
if
this
would
not
have
been
the
case
it
would
have
definitely
received
higher
marks
as
the
bottle
did
still
a
very
solid
offering
from
coast
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
o
very
drinkable
beer
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
that
you
could
drink
in
large
quantities
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
the
appearance
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
rather
solid
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
solid
beer
it
is
not
my
preferred
style
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
the
taste
that
i
had
at
the
brewery
was
solid
and
this
one
bottled
on
81011
was
good
as
well
it
is
a
nice
light
and
easy
beer
to
drink
overall
a
really
nice
kolsch
nice
to
get
a
fresh
bottle
while
in
charleston
and
enjoy
this
beer
i
frequent
charleston
a
lot
and
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
and
again
this
is
my
go
to
beer
in
chs
for
the
spring
and
summer
months
quite
possibly
the
perfect
beer
for
those
hot
humid
chucktown
days
and
nights
3250
is
a
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
but
it
did
not
impress
me
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
it
would
if
you
happen
to
be
in
south
carolina
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
o
didnt
like
it
for
the
style
or
for
beer
in
general
taste
was
bad
didnt
care
for
it
a
hazy
straw
yellow
pour
with
a
white
bubbly
head
this
beer
looks
more
like
a
belgian
white
ale
than
a
kolsch
but
it
still
looks
tasty
high
marks
all
around
for
the
classic
sulfery
kolsch
aroma
and
grassyfloral
hops
clean
is
the
key
to
a
successful
kolsch
and
coast
has
clean
nailed
it
manages
to
be
both
delicate
and
flavorful
exceptional
there
is
an
unadulterated
sulferandsweet
wheat
and
honey
flavor
that
draws
me
back
and
back
and
back
again
for
more
i
wonder
how
tostyle
this
is
for
a
kolsch
given
the
appearance
and
wheat
addition
if
anything
it
is
an
improvement
on
the
style
i
initially
had
some
problems
with
carbonation
and
found
the
excessive
bubbles
offputting
but
with
time
the
problem
subsided
id
buy
a
case
of
this
if
it
was
available
locally
overall
a
great
beer
for
the
style
it
meets
the
requirements
in
all
departments
except
appearance
but
that
is
easily
forgiven
wonderful
springsummer
beer
but
would
be
tasty
enough
to
have
any
time
of
year
overall
an
enjoyable
and
very
refreshing
kolsch
on
a
pleasantly
warm
san
diego
summer
day
definitely
a
flagship
beer
from
them
always
fresh
and
always
crisp
great
beer
for
summer
best
place
to
get
it
is
straight
from
the
source
from
the
walkin
wall
go
check
it
out
fill
your
growler
and
support
one
of
the
best
and
your
local
brewery
thats
it
for
my
first
review
kudos
to
coast
for
cranking
out
great
beer
after
great
beer
after
great
beer
o
this
is
pretty
much
a
perfect
summer
beer
a
nice
refreshing
easytodrink
kolsch
that
actually
has
some
flavor
to
it
i
tend
to
stay
away
from
the
style
because
most
of
them
are
bland
and
watery
but
if
more
kolsches
were
like
this
id
drink
them
all
summer
long
kudos
to
coast
for
reigniting
my
interest
in
a
style
id
all
but
given
up
on
yellow
and
hazy
with
a
small
white
head
good
lacing
aroma
was
black
pepper
and
spice
flavor
was
crisp
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
mild
bitterness
creamy
consistency
with
a
low
to
moderate
carbonation
interesting
and
fun
but
not
remarkable
had
at
mchales
in
fort
mill
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
on
this
beer
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
nice
head
the
smell
was
nice
nothing
overbearing
but
really
enjoyable
the
taste
followed
the
smell
wonderful
balance
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
thin
but
spot
on
overall
i
drained
this
beer
quickly
its
highly
drinkable
and
really
something
that
you
can
see
yourself
drinking
3
or
4
before
you
realized
it
it
was
a
pleasure
before
i
know
it
ive
nearly
finished
off
the
bomber
this
is
a
hell
of
a
session
beer
but
also
something
you
could
slowly
sip
and
pick
apart
hell
of
a
beer
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
sessionable
beers
out
there
o
a
good
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
easy
drinker
drinkability
very
easy
to
quaff
this
beer
a
wonderful
session
beer
that
provides
refreshment
you
want
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
easy
brew
to
drink
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
amazingly
balanced
and
i
imagine
this
would
represent
the
style
very
well
if
you
liek
very
good
drinkable
session
brews
then
definitely
hunt
this
one
otherwise
if
youre
a
big
beer
guy
dont
bother
pour
is
gorgeous
goldenstraw
body
with
quite
a
bit
of
visible
carbonation
and
a
huge
white
head
with
great
retention
very
creamy
head
loads
of
lacing
nose
is
equally
fantastic
with
some
nice
frontend
notes
of
grain
followed
up
with
some
beautiful
floral
hop
notes
the
taste
mixes
light
grain
and
floral
hops
beautifully
with
some
light
fruit
notes
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
light
with
crisp
carbonation
and
a
nice
finishing
bitterness
insanely
drinkable
this
is
currently
the
1
kolsch
and
very
deservedly
so
another
topnotch
brew
from
jamie
and
david
pours
murky
and
yellow
a
bit
of
head
but
it
dissipates
quickly
smells
a
bit
hoppy
and
yeasty
tastes
a
bit
bitter
and
hoppy
and
yeasty
very
tasty
smooth
and
crisp
and
highly
drinkable
overall
a
great
kolsch
not
my
favorite
style
but
tasty
enough
d
this
is
my
first
introduction
to
the
style
but
i
love
this
beer
it
is
so
very
light
and
refreshing
but
still
has
a
rich
fairly
complex
flavor
and
uses
ale
yeast
instead
of
lager
thank
you
very
much
matt
for
introducing
me
to
this
style
d
this
stuff
is
awesome
i
love
kölsch
and
while
this
may
not
be
kölns
idea
of
kölsch
it
is
a
perfect
take
for
a
north
carolinian
brewer
the
drinkability
on
this
is
astronomical
its
so
clean
and
crisp
a
nice
light
sweetness
on
the
initial
taste
and
finishes
smooth
and
dry
a
nice
light
herbal
hop
bitterness
teases
you
but
doesnt
overpower
at
all
no
lingering
sticky
feel
or
sweetness
it
must
have
attenuated
very
well
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
poofy
white
head
smells
really
refreshing
light
malt
slight
lemon
nothing
too
complex
again
light
malty
flavor
with
faint
citrus
notes
a
hint
of
grass
quite
bright
and
refreshing
body
is
fairly
thin
with
high
carbonation
overall
a
great
summer
beer
that
would
instantly
improve
the
tap
lineups
of
most
bars
bottle
golden
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
2
finger
head
very
clean
smelling
in
that
there
isnt
any
overpowering
aromas
that
come
from
this
at
all
the
faintest
smells
are
those
of
light
malts
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
hops
presence
the
taste
is
also
very
light
slightly
sweet
upfront
with
a
surprisingly
semibitter
aftertaste
some
floral
notes
the
aftertaste
is
bothersome
to
me
notes
this
is
my
second
coast
offering
aside
from
boy
king
and
man
this
brewery
is
impressive
too
bad
i
have
to
drive
40
minutes
away
to
get
some
up
next
is
hopart
and
belafonte
d
awesome
overall
the
aftertaste
wasnt
too
clean
which
really
bugged
me
i
would
rather
have
a
kolsch
clean
and
refreshing
it
was
pretty
decent
otherwise
i
didnt
detect
any
of
the
honey
but
i
did
get
some
herbal
notes
decent
drinkability
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
from
a
64
oz
growler
poured
from
the
charleston
beer
exchange
2
days
ago
lovely
white
head
nice
retention
soapy
fluffy
lacing
not
too
sticky
aroma
is
kinda
hard
to
describe
kolschy
maybe
a
bit
of
salt
in
the
aroma
maybe
a
bit
freshly
cut
grassy
interesting
taste
is
sorta
salty
actually
and
maybe
a
reserved
balance
between
bitterness
and
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
salt
thrown
in
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
this
is
one
you
would
drink
in
the
head
and
probably
avoid
when
its
snowing
enjoyable
tasty
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
see
myself
sitting
on
my
deck
all
day
and
not
moving
maybe
i
should
have
saved
this
for
the
holiday
weekend
low
alcohol
at
4
8
makes
this
extra
good
a
true
session
beer
with
tons
and
tons
of
flavor
this
should
satisfy
any
craft
beer
drinker
outstanding
dnot
a
favorite
style
but
some
balance
pretty
straight
forward
and
done
to
the
style
quite
grainy
and
that
seems
to
dominate
but
there
is
some
balance
with
light
hop
bitterness
i
was
lucky
enough
to
receive
a
bottle
of
this
from
thagr81us
in
a
trade
down
in
south
carolina
it
poured
an
excellent
and
vibrant
straw
yellow
with
medium
cloudiness
the
head
was
white
and
frothy
it
smelled
great
slightly
yeasty
with
citrus
hints
to
it
it
was
just
like
youd
want
a
kolsch
to
smell
the
taste
was
excellent
as
well
it
featured
the
citrus
like
yeasty
flavor
with
a
slight
sourness
to
it
it
was
superb
the
beer
was
very
very
light
almost
like
a
pale
pale
wheat
it
was
very
drinkable
and
my
friend
and
i
both
really
enjoyed
trying
it
i
greatly
recommend
this
it
was
perfect
on
a
humid
summer
night
drinkability
you
could
drink
this
all
day
long
i
have
never
cared
for
this
style
but
liked
this
one
overall
this
was
a
12
knockout
punch
wonderful
beer
from
coast
would
buy
again
and
again
and
again
in
a
heartbeat
one
of
the
best
summer
session
beers
ever
t
it
has
a
slight
malt
presence
on
the
front
of
the
sip
not
as
much
sweetness
as
i
was
expecting
from
the
smell
it
has
a
slightly
dry
finish
with
with
some
hop
notes
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
hit
the
spot
on
an
extremely
hot
day
it
is
incredibly
refreshing
i
havent
had
too
many
kolschs
but
this
is
definitely
the
best
one
i
have
had
the
palate
opens
light
with
a
blend
of
bread
raw
wheat
a
mild
grain
character
with
some
grainy
astringency
mildly
fruity
and
honeylike
in
the
midpalate
my
first
few
sips
have
a
slight
butteriness
that
decreases
as
it
breathes
hop
character
is
light
a
blend
of
delicate
spices
and
a
little
citruslike
more
an
herbal
citrus
rather
than
a
fruity
citrus
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
does
feel
a
little
slick
on
the
palate
that
slickness
along
with
the
mild
astringency
takes
away
from
the
beer
enjoyable
stuff
id
drink
an
awful
lot
of
it
id
argue
that
the
stoudts
koslch
is
better
though
its
hard
to
find
a
good
koelsch
but
coast
just
made
the
search
a
little
easier
it
has
the
nice
golden
appearance
of
a
german
style
koelsch
this
beer
just
looked
refreshing
as
it
was
100
degrees
out
that
day
the
crips
clean
taste
was
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
and
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
since
i
had
authentic
ones
in
germany
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
no
problem
a
fantastic
example
drinkability
i
feel
an
oncoming
urge
someone
find
me
a
lawn
to
mow
stat
this
is
a
fantastically
easydrinking
beer
and
i
was
a
little
blown
away
when
i
saw
it
really
was
only
4
8
abv
and
how
fantastic
that
its
offered
in
a
22
oz
format
a
summer
beer
to
be
envious
of
or
to
enjoy
copiously
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
live
in
south
carolina
so
for
those
who
do
drink
up
and
drink
up
plenty
this
is
definitely
a
case
of
less
is
more
drinkability
is
superb
the
only
way
i
imagine
this
could
be
better
would
be
on
tap
recommended
with
ease
on
a
side
note
coast
thank
you
for
dating
your
bottles
damn
excellent
beer
that
was
created
for
a
78
degree
summer
evening
with
friends
well
done
coast
drinkability
wow
if
every
kölsch
tasted
like
this
they
would
be
my
go
to
beer
style
all
summer
long
overall
impression
extremely
refreshing
and
enjoyable
brew
highly
recommended
very
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
nice
beer
to
sit
back
and
session
for
awhile
while
playing
pool
or
skeet
ball
coast
is
defintely
the
best
local
brewer
ive
tried
in
recent
years
here
in
the
carolinas
way
to
go
coast
keep
it
up
light
bodied
appropriate
carbonation
tingly
yet
still
somehow
smooth
very
refreshing
highly
drinkable
and
surprisingly
tasty
for
the
style
ill
come
back
to
this
one
as
it
starts
to
heat
up
to
those
who
say
it
needs
more
flavor
to
truly
be
labeled
a
kolsch
i
respectfully
disagree
the
aim
is
perfectly
true
on
this
one
in
my
opinion
coast
brewing
company
brews
good
beer
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
kölsch
but
this
ones
impressive
it
really
succeeds
because
of
the
honeyhop
presence
they
add
a
lot
to
the
overall
flavor
and
character
of
the
beer
im
still
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
certainly
impressive
definitely
worth
seeking
out
especially
if
youre
into
kölsch
d
this
is
an
extremely
light
beer
that
doesnt
quite
deliver
the
wheat
and
honey
notes
promised
on
the
label
there
is
some
nice
herbal
hop
character
hinted
at
in
the
aroma
but
it
fails
to
follow
through
in
the
flavor
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
very
light
malt
and
the
fleeting
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
but
both
could
stand
to
be
turned
up
a
bit
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
they
have
erred
on
the
light
side
of
the
kolsch
style
this
is
more
of
a
blonde
or
cream
ale
it
would
need
a
bit
more
malt
and
hop
presence
to
make
it
a
kolsch
i
had
this
on
draft
a
while
back
but
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
based
on
the
growler
picked
up
at
cbx
last
weekend
pours
a
bright
straw
gold
with
a
snowy
white
one
finger
head
lots
of
carbonation
going
on
smell
is
dominated
by
clean
bready
malts
taste
is
of
light
malted
grains
bread
crust
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
finishes
with
a
nice
bit
of
sweetness
followed
by
a
well
balanced
bite
also
a
little
fruity
esteryness
in
there
mouthfeel
was
pushing
mediumbodied
and
surprisingly
creamy
i
was
really
surprised
by
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
yes
awesome
stuff
so
refreshing
two
words
crazy
delicious
3250
hits
the
tongue
with
a
crisp
herbal
grassiness
that
adds
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
balance
the
white
cracker
malt
notes
clean
grassy
finish
with
a
wellcrafted
bitterness
and
a
trace
of
mineral
water
and
white
wine
spritzers
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
light
on
the
palate
with
a
brisk
bubbling
carbonation
level
all
in
all
a
pleasure
to
consume
highly
recommended
and
perhaps
the
best
americanbrewed
version
of
the
kölsch
style
somehow
this
is
so
simple
without
any
big
flavors
but
doesnt
get
too
boring
extremely
drinkable
and
one
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
especially
on
a
hot
day
this
summer
d
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
opened
up
my
eyes
to
what
a
very
well
crafted
beer
in
the
style
could
be
coast
hits
it
dead
on
and
i
personally
would
love
to
get
some
more
bottles
of
it
this
was
just
an
all
around
solid
take
on
the
kölschstyle
and
another
great
offering
from
coast
with
an
easy
drinking
crispness
and
a
good
amount
of
flavor
presence
for
a
sub
5
beer
this
would
go
down
perfectly
on
a
warm
spring
or
summer
day
beer
is
medium
body
and
finishes
without
an
aftertaste
at
all
feels
great
nice
carbonation
in
the
mouth
interesting
kolsch
second
taste
almost
fruity
that
time
again
really
drinkable
some
almost
apple
flavors
up
front
gives
way
to
really
mild
bitterness
on
the
back
end
i
am
warming
up
to
these
kolsches
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
would
order
it
and
have
it
again
so
glad
to
grab
a
bottle
of
this
in
the
midlands
pale
straw
golden
pour
has
a
fizzy
white
head
that
billows
up
and
sticks
around
lots
of
carbonation
like
a
pilsner
and
an
aroma
of
light
grains
various
melons
and
fruit
salad
taste
is
smooth
and
fresh
with
a
nice
kick
lots
of
green
grapes
in
the
taste
before
a
mild
fruity
sweetness
takes
over
some
buttery
caramel
also
present
but
there
are
enough
hops
present
to
give
this
brew
a
great
body
and
taste
finishes
sweet
and
crisp
perfect
spring
or
summer
beer
here
my
new
favorite
kolsch
i
cannot
tell
by
the
bottled
on
date
whether
this
beer
was
bottled
on
11409
or
11409
i
would
guess
that
the
date
is
in
november
based
on
the
taste
but
it
is
possible
that
im
wrong
for
a
beer
with
such
low
abv
3250
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
it
is
truly
something
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
on
a
summer
day
right
on
for
the
style
d
this
kind
of
tastes
like
beerin
the
sense
most
nonbeer
drinkers
would
describe
nothing
really
all
that
good
about
this
beer
unfortunately
keep
it
up
coast
i
dont
drink
too
many
of
the
lighter
styles
such
as
this
but
for
a
light
session
ale
this
would
be
great
blows
away
the
macros
that
could
be
considered
similar
really
quite
enjoyable
d
an
example
of
a
beer
that
is
light
crisp
and
enjoyable
yep
extremely
enjoyable
go
kölsch
go
an
excellent
beer
for
a
hot
day
and
an
interesting
domestic
variant
on
this
subtle
style
endlessly
drinkable
pretty
carbonated
up
front
probably
too
much
so
with
a
light
crisp
sweet
yet
earthy
body
and
dry
effervescent
finish
subtle
bready
yeast
with
light
crisp
fruit
notes
namely
apple
and
pear
along
with
a
nice
earthy
grassy
hop
presence
the
honey
used
adds
some
additional
sweetness
but
this
beer
is
excellently
balanced
and
complex
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
highly
recommended
nice
example
of
a
kolsch
albeit
one
that
trades
some
of
the
crispness
for
a
more
rounded
fuller
flavor
which
in
itself
is
remarkable
given
the
low
4
8abv
growler
from
the
charleston
beer
exchange
pours
a
classic
light
golden
with
good
clarity
the
head
is
somewhat
slight
but
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
ill
chalk
that
up
to
the
growler
the
smell
is
rounded
rather
than
crisp
with
an
almost
nutty
aroma
of
lager
yeast
and
some
gentle
hops
the
taste
is
also
rounded
with
a
bit
of
butteriness
and
some
lager
yeast
up
front
but
with
a
refreshing
noble
hop
crispness
that
is
long
and
refreshing
really
nice
lingering
bitterness
makes
this
quite
satisfying
and
makes
it
feel
a
bit
more
full
bodied
than
it
really
is
becomes
more
delicious
with
every
sip
quite
nice
smells
a
bit
grainy
with
light
fruits
and
citrus
sweet
malts
and
hops
taste
is
also
sweet
with
a
bit
of
grass
very
crisp
and
refreshing
very
refreshing
light
body
good
carbonation
would
session
this
beer
all
day
long
had
this
at
the
battery
soccer
game
last
week
yes
they
sell
this
at
the
local
semipro
soccer
games
anyway
it
was
a
great
beer
for
the
time
especially
since
it
was
a
bit
hot
out
it
had
a
nice
light
fruitwheat
taste
to
it
as
well
as
a
malty
backbone
the
slight
hint
of
the
hops
didnt
overpower
the
others
the
head
was
thick
and
creamy
even
lasted
a
while
in
a
plastic
cup
definitely
going
to
have
another
at
tonights
game
go
battery
well
done
d
this
one
goes
down
super
fast
especially
when
you
are
at
the
beach
in
the
hot
and
humid
south
if
you
make
this
the
first
kolsch
you
will
love
the
style
for
the
rest
of
you
life
the
taste
follows
the
nose
there
is
little
flavor
but
the
beer
is
extremelt
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
an
excellent
summer
beer
to
drink
in
large
quantities
good
job
coast
i
cannot
wait
to
get
some
more
of
your
offerings
the
mouthfeel
is
as
crisp
as
ive
ever
had
in
a
beer
and
leads
to
exceptional
drinkability
i
could
have
taken
down
this
entire
growler
in
short
order
a
great
kolsch
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
although
i
have
to
admit
im
still
developing
an
appreciation
for
said
style
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
to
be
enjoyed
while
playing
bocci
ball
thanks
again
to
ding
for
sharing
this
notes
another
winner
from
coast
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
very
light
and
goes
down
easy
this
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
ive
certainly
had
this
one
the
most
though

overall
outstanding
probably
the
best
session
ale
i
have
had
in
i
dont
even
know
how
long
this
was
intense
tight
perfect
i
was
in
heaven
thank
you
jamie
and
david
for
brewing
such
a
wonderful
ale
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
break
a
market
wide
open
it
was
presented
in
a
roomtemperature
glass
with
a
thin
bonewhite
head
with
moderate
retention
the
color
was
spot
on
a
beautiful
deepgolden
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
muted
slightly
malty
but
not
terribly
present
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
dry
lemony
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
humid
day
such
as
the
one
that
i
was
experiencing
in
charleston
sc
zum
wohl
this
is
quite
the
enjoyable
brew
especially
with
the
warmer
months
coming
up
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
it
would
be
cool
if
this
got
bottled
because
not
only
is
the
beer
great
but
the
label
would
be
nice
too
could
drink
a
great
deal
of
this
if
only
they
would
bottle
this
beer
it
would
be
the
ultimate
summer
outing
brew
this
is
an
excellent
beer
far
better
than
the
kolsch
offerings
from
harpoon
and
flying
dog
youd
do
well
to
seek
this
one
out
when
on
the
charleston
beach
i
look
forward
to
the
day
i
can
take
a
few
cans
of
this
down
to
the
waterfront
a
great
light
session
beer
i
think
this
is
very
drinkable
brew
for
high
abv
smooth
from
start
to
finish
its
an
excellent
kolsch
great
hop
aroma
and
flavor
great
smooth
after

great
carbonation
pours
a
light
yellow
beer
with
a
small

like
most
kolsches
tastes
pretty
delicious

is

franconia
kolsch
is
a
cloudy
yellow
beer
with
almost
no
head
which
i
found
hard
to
move
past
at
first
it
smells
like
a
light
nutty
sweet
grain
as
youd
expect
from
this
style
but
it
falls
short
of
outstanding
on
the
tongue
is
a
bit
flat
but
still
refreshing
and
smooth
its
unique
enough
to
warrant
an
outstanding
rating
for
its
sweet
grain
flavor
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
with
a
little
better
carbonation
it
could
be
a
great
beer
this
kolsch
beer
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
even
if
it
is
somewhat
lighter
than
i
prefer
its
appearance
could
stand
to
be
improved
as
there
is
almost
no
foam
to
speak
of
and
the
sweetness
level
could
prove
too
much
for
some
i
dont
rank
it
among
my
favorite
examples
of
this
style
but
i
can
agree
that
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
it
would
make
a
good
choice
of
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
better
than
average
but
with
a
few
tweaks
it
could
be
outstanding
it
is
one
of
the
better
kolsch
ive
had
on
tap
at
the
brewery
the
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
and
grain
with
some
lemon
and
grass
notes
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
wheat
with
some
lemon
and
grape
notes
there
is
a
little
bit
of
grass
and
earth
from
the
hops
but
they
contribute
basically
no
bitterness
light
and
refreshing
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
medium
carbonation
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
good
on
a
warm
summer
day
d
pleasant
a
little
sweeter
than
than
i
like
my
kolschs
maybe
even
a
little
macro
brewery
well
done
d
this
is
the
definition
of
a
ho
hum
beer
and
yes
i
know
its
not
supposed
to
be
big
and
bold
but
my
add
is
to
strong
for
this
beer
its
average
boring
and
just
not
worth
it
to
me
i
think
this
a
very
good
kolsch
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
a
surprisingly
and
deceivingly
complex
brew
light
but
enough
body
and
flavor
to
satisfy
a
great
beer
for
the
hot
texas
summers
or
just
for
an
easy
session
recommended
had
this
beer
a
few
weeks
ago
so
this
review
is
from
the
notes
i
wrote
about
it
it
poured
with
a
light
light
golden
color
with
a
clear
body
it
a
nice
hoppy
smell
with
hints
of
fruits
which
i
thought
were
mostly
apple
i
was
surprised
with
the
taste
though
because
the
fruits
were
not
nearly
as
strong
as
they
were
in
the
smell
it
was
very
light
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
it
would
be
a
good
replacement
for
any
light
beer
on
a
night
out
definitely
worth
a
try
a
very
consistent
beer
not
riddled
with
a
taste
of
corn
like
most
american
kolsch
style
beers
crisp
some
apple
malt
qualities
and
some
very
subdued
hop
that
just
clears
everything
out
simple
and
not
astringent
or
acidic
tight
in
form
and
mild
in
taste
a
recommended
kolsch
but
not
in
the
upper
tier
of
the
style
o
an
ok
bier
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
it
was
extremely
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
metropolitan
brewing
krankshaft
kölsch

the
best
kolsch
i
have
ever
tasted
this
is
my
very
favorite
beer
for
hot
days
and
spicy
food
awesomely
subtle
backend
fruitiness
and
well
representative
of
how
a
kolsch
should
be
overall
another
excellent
offering
from
metropolitan
there
simply
arent
enough
good
kolsch
beers
out
there
so
i
would
seek
this
one
out
if
you
are
a
fan
overall
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
have
preferred
from
metropolitan
but
still
very
nice
i
always
looks
forward
to
a
couple
of
these
when
i
come
back
home
to
chicago
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
slightly
fizzy
then
foamy
34
and
smooth
14
mouthfeel
thats
a
bit
overcarbonated
for
both
this
beer
and
the
style
closes
dry
with
light
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
d
extremely
drinkable
the
definition
of
a
good
session
beer
this
one
surprised
me
in
a
big
way
started
out
unassuming
and
finished
extremely
strong
thanks
to
kris
for
bringing
this
one
back
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
brew
but
am
a
little
partial
to
kolsches
and
other
wheaty
beers
and
have
had
quite
a
few
that
stack
up
favorably
to
this
that
being
said
this
was
extremely
refreshing
and
would
likely
pair
with
a
great
range
of
meals
taste
light
sweet
malt
with
cherry
and
banana
lightly
on
the
tongue
wheat
actually
comes
through
with
a
touch
of
bread
earthy
floral
and
slight
spiciness
from
the
hops
as
this
beer
ends
semi
dry
note
even
in
cologne
some
beer
gardens
serve
it
in
0
4
glasses
because
its
such
a
nuisance
to
keep
bringing
out
those
little
ones
but
youll
find
the
flavor
just
dissipates
in
those
its
a
very
delicate
beer
and
i
encourage
you
to
try
a
tastetest
drink
some
from
a
koelschtype
glass
and
some
from
a
normal
beer
glass
and
see
if
it
tastes
different
a
clean
malt
with
german
hops
and
so
forth
however
lacking
in
style
and
taste
numerous
times
ive
wanted
this
beer
and
tasted
this
beer
to
no
avail
the
firm
and
minute
nutty
taste
that
comes
from
a
kolsch
is
not
here
o
meh
didnt
care
much
for
this
one
overall
drinkability
a
very
good
american
kölsch
there
is
a
skeleton
of
an
ok
beer
in
here
but
as
is
this
is
is
disappointing
and
difficult
to
drink
o
i
liked
this
one
not
many
good
kolsch
from
domestic
brewers
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
flavor
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
much
to
it
o
still
not
at
all
my
style
ugh
but
its
complex
and
nice
if
youre
into
this
style
i
hesitate
to
say
chick
beer
ill
stick
to
my
pale
ales
but
i
could
very
rarely
enjoy
one
of
these
in
the
spring
or
summer
a
nice
kolsch
o
well
rounded
with
a
good
taste
and
high
drinkability
what
more
could
you
ask
for
at
a
ball
park
overall
refreshing
and
flavorful
o
nice
to
taste
a
good
fresh
rendition
of
a
kolsch
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
an
excellent
warm
weather
beer
very
crisp
and
clean
perfect
examples
of
this
style
drinks
so
easy
a
very
well
done
refreshing
kolsch
the
only
small
issue
i
have
is
that
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
heat
on
the
flavor
profile
but
not
enough
to
seriously
detract
from
this
great
brew
the
addition
of
the
wheat
does
a
great
job
increasing
smoothness
easy
drinking
smooth
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
this
was
unlike
any
kolsch
ive
had
that
being
said
it
definitely
imprinted
itself
in
my
memory
and
i
look
forward
to
purchasing
it
again
soon
o
pretty
much
excellent
in
every
aspect
id
maybe
suggest
adding
a
more
assertive
hop
note
at
some
point
as
the
brew
was
not
as
bitter
as
id
like
in
a
kolsch
3540
ibu
would
be
amazing
in
my
opinoin
this
is
more
of
a
finishing
touch
suggestion
though
as
everything
else
is
topnotch
o
nice
little
beer
here
easy
to
drink
goes
well
with
food
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
could
drink
more
than
one
have
seen
this
sitting
on
the
shelves
forever
and
never
picked
it
up
until
today
this
beer
is
a
bright
crystal
clear
golden
color
topped
off
with
a
half
inch
of
white
fluffy
head
that
recedes
to
a
film
an
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
is
grainy
and
mildly
bready
mild
grassy
earthy
herbal
hop
aroma
the
initial
pour
yields
a
bit
of
bread
yeast
aroma
as
well
taste
has
a
bit
of
makeovers
with
more
breadiness
and
grainy
flavor
light
fruityness
emerges
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
and
refreshing
good
carbonation
very
good
beer
o
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
one
that
i
would
offer
to
any
budmillercoors
drinker
without
hesitation
a
great
offering
by
one
of
the
newer
and
better
local
breweries
in
the
chicago
area
this
is
an
ok
kolsch
style
lager
pours
clear
and
light
golden
color
nice
white
head
bitter
but
not
overpowering
very
drinkable
beer
however
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
a
slight
metallic
after
taste
i
know
quite
a
few
people
who
love
this
beer
so
i
feel
bad
not
giving
it
a
higher
review
that
said
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
average
beer
at
best
its
better
than
coors
light
but
not
by
much
i
love
supporting
local
breweries
so
i
will
continue
to
try
everything
that
metropolitan
produces
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
overall
easy
drinking
and
packed
with
flavor
especially
for
such
a
pale
beer
overall
wow
this
might
be
the
worst
kolsch
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
without
a
lot
of
depth
its
very
refreshing
though
and
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
great
summer
beer
kölsch
is
quickly
become
my
favorite
summer
drink
this
beer
was
very
light
and
refreshing
nice
an
bready
and
not
too
hoppy
great
beer
not
much
to
say
i
will
definitely
get
it
again
the
brewery
is
so
close
to
me
crank
it
up
gees
trying
the
krankshaft
kolsch
the
appearance
is
ok
very
yellow
with
no
head
clear
the
smell
is
mostly
grain
with
some
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
is
powered
by
grain
that
is
somewhat
burnt
there
are
some
hints
of
citrus
but
this
beer
is
really
not
to
my
liking
mouthfeel
its
light
and
somewhat
easy
drinking
but
not
one
that
i
would
choose
unless
the
alternative
was
a
typical
american
adjuct
from
macro
breweries
worht
a
try
sure
worth
a
revisit
i
dont
know
o
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
were
it
available
in
my
market
o
overall
impression
another
style
home
run
not
to
mention
delicious
to
metropolitan
im
glad
i
looked
past
the
price
tag
on
these
beers
to
find
that
they
are
so
spot
on
for
the
styles
and
so
fresh
that
they
will
give
anyone
the
true
character
of
german
style
beers
dont
know
what
aasher
was
drinking
but
im
guessing
it
may
have
been
the
first
pour
of
the
day
and
he
should
have
requested
a
fresh
glass
had
on
tap
at
hay
market
a
fantastic
brew
pub
in
chicago
everyone
should
visit
when
given
the
chance
this
beer
came
out
with
a
thin
head
and
clear
gold
body
but
what
really
grabbed
my
interest
was
the
smell
very
floral
and
alluring
the
taste
was
amazingly
clean
and
smooth
but
not
wimpy
strong
tones
of
wheat
and
a
zest
of
lemon
followed
each
swig
didnt
expect
much
but
this
is
now
my
go
to
session
beer
when
found
on
tap
i
had
this
one
on
tap
while
in
chicago
yesterday
i
hadnt
heard
of
it
before
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
it
was
a
huge
disappointment
it
arrived
a
very
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
light
white
head
it
was
very
clear
it
smelled
of
a
skunked
dortmunder
lager
and
didnt
have
much
kolsch
to
it
at
all
i
was
really
disappointed
the
flavor
too
of
skunked
dortmunder
bummer
it
drank
light
but
i
hated
it
luckily
the
manager
came
by
and
asked
us
how
our
meal
was
and
brought
me
a
fresh
lagunitas
ipa
to
replace
it
amazing
and
courteous
gesture
sizable
plume
of
white
head
tapers
to
a
clinging
lace
pale
yellow
color
has
a
great
clarity
to
it
smells
of
fresh
baked
shortbread
hint
of
lemon
zest
and
subtle
wildflowers
deepplanted
crispness
presents
the
lighter
body
in
a
lush
manner
dry
from
start
to
finish
the
lightly
toasted
cracker
maltiness
holds
more
flavor
than
expected
lemon
herbal
hoppiness
lends
more
than
enough
bitterness
to
get
by
ghostlike
sulfur
clean
grainy
finish
obviously
someone
got
their
homework
right
herethis
is
more
proof
that
smaller
brewers
can
brew
extremely
flavorful
palecolored
beers
kudos
to
metro
highly
drinkable
im
impressed
by
this
one
the
body
is
crisp
and
clean
carbonation
level
spritzes
it
up
without
fizzing
the
mouth
up
lots
of
lemon
tartness
mild
hop
presence
slight
earthy
quality
this
is
a
splendid
tame
beer
perfect
for
the
warmer
months
but
just
fine
any
other
time
tasty
refreshing
beer
recommend
conclusion
my
overall
impression
was
fairly
good
it
was
clean
nothing
that
was
offensive
mostly
i
prefer
darker
more
assertive
beers
and
i
dont
typically
reach
for
lagers
but
this
was
good
it
was
a
simple
professional
tasting
kolsh
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
had
this
out
of
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
poured
a
light
golden
yellow
just
a
touch
darker
than
you
see
with
a
bmc
type
beer
thin
head
that
disappeared
quickly
not
a
lot
to
the
aroma
a
bit
of
grasshay
and
a
tad
of
sweetness
that
i
couldnt
place
flavor
was
nice
and
refreshing
malty
and
bready
up
front
finishes
with
a
hint
of
honey
nice
and
crisp
good
carbonation
level
and
goes
down
easy
could
definitely
put
a
few
of
these
away
pretty
quickly
its
the
dead
of
winter
right
now
but
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
beach
beer
is
sweet
and
light
in
body
there
is
a
strong
graininess
and
an
unfortunate
aftertaste
its
not
the
best
kolsch
ive
had
i
doubt
i
would
have
it
again
pour
brings
a
slightlydark
golden
color
its
a
bit
too
dark
for
the
style
white
head
that
lasts
for
a
short
while
before
falling
without
too
much
lacing
very
thin
collar
throughout
nose
is
bready
and
faintly
pleasant
with
a
fairlylarge
amount
of
fruity
notes
for
the
style
the
taste
is
more
toward
the
bready
end
of
the
spectrum
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
a
very
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
body
is
light
but
more
toward
medium
than
it
should
be
carbonation
is
a
tad
bit
low
drinks
pretty
well
overall
but
is
just
good
not
great
drinkability
having
more
than
one
is
a
struggle
im
actually
giving
away
the
rest
if
i
can
if
i
cant
im
just
going
to
dump
the
beer
and
save
the
bottles
for
my
homebrewing
this
is
one
of
the
worst
local
brews
ive
had
i
havent
gotten
the
chance
to
try
any
other
metropolitan
beers
i
hope
metropolitan
can
put
out
a
better
product
than
this
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
which
does
hide
out
before
exploding
along
my
tongue
there
is
a
watery
aftertaste
that
just
falls
short
of
being
fullflavored
the
drinkability
however
is
high
due
to
the
pleasant
mix
of
flavors
and
lack
of
any
noticeable
alcohol
i
would
happily
enjoy
this
beer
again
its
not
up
there
with
the
excellent
coast
kölsch
but
its
still
quite
nice
nicely
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
though
id
like
to
see
it
just
a
wee
bit
drier
falls
just
short
of
the
best
german
examples
which
is
fairly
high
praise
its
a
very
delicate
beer
really
as
it
should
be
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
prickly
and
drying
almost
too
drying
its
a
solid
effort
i
just
dont
think
its
quite
as
flavorful
as
your
best
german
kölsches
nice
just
a
well
made
kölsch
here
well
balanced
flavorful
and
extremely
easy
drinking
im
glad
that
i
picked
up
a
full
sixer
of
these
when
i
was
last
out
in
chicago
metro
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
good
taste
light
body
and
an
near
perfect
mouthfeel
you
could
drink
this
all
night
long
overall
another
well
made
german
beer
from
metropolitan
super
refreshing
and
delicious
this
brewery
and
i
are
getting
along
well
this
was
my
first
beer
from
metropolitan
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
impressed
i
have
to
say
i
like
most
am
a
fan
of
bigger
bolder
styles
flavors
etc
however
i
havent
lost
my
love
for
softer
more
subtle
styles
and
their
intricacies
that
said
ive
had
a
few
kolsches
before
but
i
also
have
some
experience
with
whats
intended
of
the
style
and
what
it
should
be
ive
seen
how
homebrewers
are
supposed
to
make
it
style
guidelines
that
sort
of
thing
i
think
that
this
brewery
id
never
heard
of
before
this
beer
came
in
my
box
may
have
made
the
best
kolsch
to
style
that
ive
witnessed
d
a
little
less
sweetness
and
this
would
make
for
a
great
summer
refreshing
beer
still
good
regardless
it
went
down
very
nicely
d
solid
example
of
the
style
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pilsener
glass
medium
head
quickly
subsides
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
foam
minimal
lacing
present
nice
aroma
featuring
grainy
notes
and
subtle
bitterness
underneath
very
clean
and
crisp
taste
with
graininess
and
notes
of
hay
in
the
forefront
which
really
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
a
slightly
grapey
sourness
lurks
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
features
a
pleasant
bite
of
carbonation
though
it
does
seem
a
bit
thin
i
admit
im
not
very
familiar
with
this
style
but
this
beer
would
probably
be
best
enjoyed
in
the
warmer
weather
great
kolsch
flavor
really
nice
for
the
style
crisp
mouthfeel
light
malty
a
little
bit
of
hops
super
drinkable
i
cant
say
that
ive
had
all
that
many
different
examples
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
good
beer
refreshing
and
summery
it
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
pale
yellow
somewhere
between
maize
and
madder
yellow
head
is
sudsy
relatively
small
and
white
the
aroma
is
pale
maltsweet
with
a
mild
vinous
character
id
prefer
a
bit
more
grape
but
its
a
minor
complaint
a
tiny
bit
of
butterscotch
sneaks
in
as
it
warms
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
but
theres
a
nice
grassy
noble
hop
bite
in
the
finish
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
doesnt
try
to
overwhelm
you
with
flavor
good
for
a
hot
day
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
light
and
a
touch
slick
good
beer
though
im
still
not
entirely
won
over
to
the
style
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
with
a
full
malt
flavor
for
a
kolsch
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
strong
to
drink
to
many
in
a
row
d
this
actually
has
the
drinkability
that
the
macro
lagers
all
claim
to
have
easy
to
gulp
dwow
this
is
the
first
kolsch
to
really
get
my
attention
really
solid
flavorful
beer
that
happens
to
be
lighter
bodied
and
insanely
drinkable
if
you
can
get
it
do
it
its
great
on
tap
as
well
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
its
like
drinking
a
glass
of
water
why
would
you
want
to
drink
it
light
carbonation
light
and
somewhat
creamy
body
very
drinkable
i
could
go
through
a
lot
of
these
quickly
a
new
favorite
for
me
in
chicago
i
foresee
many
of
these
in
my
belly
in
the
future
f
semi
dry
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
light
lingering
malt
and
kolsch
flavors
would
be
a
pretty
goo
light
summer
drink
but
ive
had
better
kolsch
beers
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
beer
that
you
can
pound
down
but
there
are
better
ones
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
d
extremely
drinkable
and
tasty
too
would
make
an
ideal
session
beer
easily
my
favorite
metropolitan
beer
to
date
a
great
example
of
an
american
made
kölsch
i
usually
like
this
style
in
the
summer
but
its
still
hitting
the
spot
on
this
cold
night
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
the
other
four
bottles
its
highly
fizzed
maybe
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
heavier
than
expected
a
great
drinker
and
a
sessionable
beer
this
is
my
second
six
pack
and
one
to
keep
around
year
round
if
you
live
in
chicagoland
yeah
very
drinkable
matching
well
on
its
own
in
summer
or
fall
with
lighter
foods
so
extremely
drinkable
another
winner
from
metropolitan
metro
date
stamps
their
six
packs
3
months
out
so
theres
really
no
reason
to
drink
or
review
old
bottles
get
it
fresh
looks
like
there
are
plenty
of
reviews
that
have
no
concept
of
what
a
kölsch
is
kind
of
sad
really
krankshaft
poured
a
super
pale
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
a
large
white
fluffy
head
the
smell
was
of
yeast
and
a
lemony
citrus
hint
taste
was
crisp
citrusy
flavor
very
refreshing
even
if
a
bit
light
mouthfeel
was
right
for
the
style
drinkability
was
good
as
well
this
was
a
nice
beer
from
a
promising
new
brewery
i
will
keep
my
eye
for
this
one
again
surprisingly
full
bodied
for
the
style
and
considering
how
pale
it
is
crisp
spiciness
up
front
with
a
nice
bit
of
floral
hops
followed
by
a
yeasty
bready
body
with
hints
of
pilsner
malt
and
light
crisp
fruit
notes
mostly
apple
and
banana
also
there
is
a
bit
of
earthy
grass
and
straw
presence
that
compliment
the
sweetness
of
the
light
fruit
and
malts
as
well
as
the
slightly
earthy
hops
very
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
recommended
drinkability
is
good
for
a
kölsch
this
is
a
good
fresh
example
with
a
solid
character
and
drinakble
aura
cheers
d
id
say
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
ratings
here
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
while
still
offering
up
a
lot
of
complexity
to
ruminate
on
if
ruminating
is
your
thing
this
beer
is
not
just
one
things
that
is
one
main
aroma
one
main
flavor
etc
each
sip
you
can
pick
up
something
you
may
have
missed
before
a
superb
effort
from
another
great
local
brewery
d
the
beer
has
really
good
but
subtle
flavor
and
is
light
and
smooth
as
it
goes
down
the
hatch
a
great
session
beer
strongly
recommended
for
anyone
that
likes
the
style
and
something
id
try
even
if
not
a
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
d
coming
out
in
the
fall
when
all
i
want
is
big
hops
and
looking
forward
to
stouts
and
barleywines
and
yet
this
is
so
refreshing
i
could
drink
so
many
of
these
this
is
a
huge
contender
to
my
summer
favorite
gumballhead
really
well
done
metro
im
a
fan
again
d
i
wouldnt
call
this
beer
complex
but
if
youre
going
to
make
a
simple
beer
you
cant
make
any
mistakes
and
krankshaft
doesnt
have
any
major
flaws
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
and
probably
through
several
more
bottles
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
highly
enough
smooth
and
easy
drinking
yet
flavorful
and
satisfying
this
is
well
done
love
it
love
it
love
it
great
tasting
ale
of
the
style
definitely
a
go
to
standard
a
nice
balanced
beer
toasted
malted
flavors
permeate
the
beer
but
its
still
a
smooth
beer
that
pairs
well
with
anything
it
has
a
sweet
note
but
they
dont
linger
for
long
overall
this
is
definitely
more
like
an
american
blonde
ale
than
a
kölsch
but
in
either
case
it
doesnt
strongly
appeal
to
me
superbly
smooth
the
beer
looks
exactly
as
its
supposed
to
its
not
a
kolsch
its
a
golden
ale
if
you
didnt
figure
that
out
you
were
already
in
for
the
wrong
ride
this
beer
really
opens
up
and
its
floral
has
a
great
softness
due
to
the
water
they
use
and
it
has
a
slight
sweetness
and
bitterness
thats
perfectly
balanced
overall
a
great
beer
for
session
or
whatever
perfect
for
all
seasons
i
really
like
this
beer
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
outside
o
great
kolsch
i
found
it
to
be
very
easy
drinking
but
still
quite
flavorful
definately
a
beer
one
could
sit
down
and
have
multiples
of
pours
to
a
frothy
white
head
and
deep
gold
color
aroma
is
grassy
hops
and
sweet
malt
favor
presents
with
a
grainy
start
biscuity
vinous
middle
and
clean
mildly
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
co2is
generous
had
this
beer
on
tap
the
night
before
this
review
and
have
to
say
on
tap
is
definitely
better
overall
a
decent
kolsch
and
a
good
crossover
brew
for
the
midsouth
pours
a
clear
rich
golden
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
a
light
grain
aroma
taste
is
sweet
and
light
caramel
up
front
followed
by
a
rich
cream
flavor
next
up
is
some
doughy
bread
and
a
zesty
light
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
over
a
nice
kolsch
i
would
get
this
again
had
this
beer
at
a
concert
in
memphis
purchased
from
the
brewers
stand
assume
that
it
was
pretty
fresh
to
me
this
is
a
good
night
out
day
at
the
lake
mowing
the
lawn
kind
of
beer
far
better
than
the
mass
produced
st
louis
swill
nothing
to
sit
around
and
sip
on
at
the
house
or
share
for
a
special
moment
but
a
good
summer
time
hot
weather
beer
to
enjoy
overall
a
pretty
forgetable
beer
drinkability
is
extremely
high
but
flavors
are
somewhat
lacking
not
offensive
but
not
impressive
either
overall
very
easy
drinking
simple
but
enjoyable
session
beer
a
pretty
forgettable
beer
i
didnt
even
realize
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
kolsch
it
didnt
really
taste
like
one
or
be
one
o
overall
a
very
average
beer
nose
and
taste
and
pretty
bland
with
some
light
herbal
notes
in
the
taste
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
o
its
alright
and
totally
worth
a
try
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
theres
nothing
about
it
that
made
me
say
wow
this
beer
strikes
me
as
a
great
summer
beer
the
flavors
and
aromas
arent
very
bold
but
they
arent
bad
either
its
good
enough
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
o
in
no
way
does
ghost
rivers
golden
ale
resemble
a
traditional
kolsch
though
it
didnt
prevent
me
from
moderately
enjoying
it
this
actually
comes
off
like
a
cream
ale
not
too
dissimilar
to
sixpoints
sweet
action
if
youre
looking
for
a
reasonably
flavorful
craft
session
option
this
would
most
likely
deliver
your
fix
light
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
would
be
a
decent
summer
brew
this
beer
would
be
great
in
the
summertime
heat
i
think
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
that
has
a
nice
sweetish
malt
twist
i
dont
think
its
quite
a
kolsch
and
may
be
more
of
a
blonde
or
even
a
cream
ale
in
thinking
of
it
not
spectacular
maybe
a
good
starter
beer
for
those
who
might
start
drinking
craftimported
non
fizzy
yellow
water
o
decent
summer
beer
i
would
never
order
this
again
just
to
have
it
but
on
a
hot
day
this
was
alright
very
forgettable
but
though
it
wasnt
great
there
werent
any
ridiculous
flaws
either
d
sessionable
to
be
sure
but
this
beer
needs
a
little
bit
of
polishing
pours
a
clear
golden
color

inch

a
white
color
great
retention
and
slight

the
style
of
a
kolsch
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
hops
hint
of
wheat
and
grain
overall
average
kolsch
at
best
appearance
is
cloudy
carbonated
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
smell
was
bitter
earthy
and
woody
the
taste
was
carbonated
and
crisp
but
very
dry
and
bitter
in
the
finish
nice
medium
body
on
the
palate
but
not
enough
flavor
for
me
to
session
this
beer
is
very
light
and
dry
while
it
has
a
nice
crispness
to
it
the
flavor
is
a
little
underwhelming
for
my
taste
slightly
sweet
it
is
a
nice
summer
beer
for
those
who
like
things
on
the
lighter
side
light
malt
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
roasted
nut
the
nut
came
through
in
the
quaff
nicely
mixing
well
with
a
woody
resin
and
a
touch
of
caramel
well
balanced
with
the
hops
in
the
finish
i
was
pleased
with
this
brew
and
would
look
for
it
again
in
the
bottle
for
some
summer
stl
quaffing
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
hops
seemed
bitter
without
any
real
flavor
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
with
a
nice
drinkable
feel
that
goes
down
easy
and
really
works
well
with
your
palette
and
lets
its
silky
body
let
it
glide
down
a
great
drinker
and
one
that
would
great
any
time
nice
and
balanced
i
got
no
hoppiness
at
all
dry
finish
i
was
disappointed
quick
drinking
thanks
to
its
pale
maltgrassy
hop
balance
refreshing
solid
example
of
the
style
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
very
easy
drinking
and

base
with

light
medium

with
a
nice

texture
slightly
below
normal
carbonation
with
just
a
touch

in

the
flavor
profile
is
quite
nice
for
a
kolsch
above
average
intensity
for
the
style
well
balanced
and
fairly
complex
it
begins
with
a
mix
of
light
fruit
banana
pear
that
flows
into
a
somewhat
crisp
biscuit
sweetness
the
middle
is
a
very
mild
hop
bitterness
that
is
herbal
in
nature
that
yields
to
a
slight
note
of
pepper
like
spice
the
finish
is
a
slow
fade
of
herbal
bitterness
and
biscuit
that
ends
with
a
touch
of
dryness
overall
outstanding
due
to
the
full
flavor
and
smoothness
the
maltiness
and
sweetness
compliment
each
other
very
well
this
beer
should
just
be
called
kolsch
as
pale
ale
is
a
bit
deceptive
due
to
the
style
nevertheless
a
high
quality
beer
that
should
be
tasted
has
that
characteristic
kolsch
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
along
with
bready
nutty
malt
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
backbone
of
nutty
malt
asking
with
fruity
yeast
highly
carbonated
so
the
toasted
malt
doesnt
weigh
it
down
very
drinkable
but
nothing
outstanding
more
malty
than
most
examples
of
the
style
i
thought
i
was
getting
a
pale
ale
and
was
pretty
confused
until
i
looked
it
up
wanted
to
have
some
gentle
hops
today
but
for
kolsh
it
was
okay
pretty
simple
light
malty
flavor
with
some
hints
of
apricot
and
sweetness
i
should
probably
try
it
again
when
i
want
a
kolsh
i
think
this
is
pretty
well
done
for
its
style
i
was
taken
a
bit
off
guard
at
first
as
i
was
not
expecting
a
klosch
style
ale
but
rather
something
along
the
lines
of
a
american
pale
ale
i
failed
to
see
the
small
print
that
denoted
the
beer
as
klosch
style
overall
i
would
say
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
can
appeal
to
a
wide
audience
it
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
to
drink
by
the
pool
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
decent
brew
sessionable
good
beer
to
drink
while
watching
a
sporting
event
on
tv
which
is
what
i
did
o
a
good
standard
american
pale
ale
with
a
small
interesting
twist
which
is
the
slightly
fruity
but
not
very
long
facet
of
the
finish
the
label
does
say
in
small
letters
kolsch
style
ale
really
sweet
very
low
bitterness
with
high
amount
sweetness
made
the
beer
off
balanced
medium
mouth
feel
not
bad
but
there
are
much
better
beers
from
this
brewery

crafted
with
aromatic

and
rounded
out
with
a
blend
of
american
and
munich
malts
while
its
hopped
like
a
lager
looks
more
yellow
in
color
than
a
pale
ale
smells
a
little
skunky
tastes
between
a
heineken
and
fat
tire
feels
too
lite
with
little
alcohol
on
it
crisp
and
dry
light
yet
flavorful
with
a
host
of
yeast
derived
notes
cascading
onto
the
palate
my
only
knocks
are
the
texture
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
flavors
seem
to
clash
at
times
but
besides
that
it
does
its
job
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
it
goes
great
with
pasta
always
relaxes
me
after
a
long
day
at
work
overall
a
disappointment
calling
this
a
pale
ale
is
misleading
yes
its
an
ale
that
is
pale
but
it
is
not
what
one
expects
when
ordering
a
pale
ale
easy
drinker
flavorful
and
mellow
smells
like
a
lager
and
tastes
like
a
lager
but
bitter
and
crisp
i
didnt
look
at
the
label
too
closely
before
trying
this
one
so
i
was
expecting
more
of
an
american
pale
ale
that
considered
my
first
reaction
was
disappointment
the
flavors
seemed
dulled
and
there
was
not
the
freshness
that
i
expect
from
an
apa
when
i
saw
the
kolsch
subheading
it
made
a
lot
more
sense
a
good
enjoyable
brew
but
not
one
that
i
expect
to
repurchase

o
not

its

this
was
a
very
disappointing
beer
it
has
all
the
drawbacks
of
a
light
american
beer
but
lacking
the
crispness
and
carrying
a
higher
price
avoid
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pale
ale
it
is
most
similar
to
kona
longboard
or
olympia
too
much
malty
sweetness
for
my
taste
without
much
complexity
to
balance
it
out
the
lingering
aftertaste
is
better
than
some
of
the
other
beers
mentioned
with
some
hints
of
citrus
fruit
this
is
my
second
go
around
with
yellowtail
figuring
the
last
batch
i
had
was
a
dud
but
i
am
just
as
underwhelmed
very
earthy
taste
to
this
pale
ale
reminds
me
of
a
sierra
nevada
a
bit
sweet
on
the
tongue
with
just
enough
bite
to
make
it
above
average
in
this
category
the
beer
has
a
golden
orange
hue
minimal
foam
lace
and
carbonation
and
a
crisp
clean
taste
leaves
the
right
amount
of
taste
on
the
tongue
and
is
not
harsh
like
some
other
ipas
tend
to
be
a
very
worthy
effort
ballast
point
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
the
best
breweries
on
the
west
coast
but
this
is
not
their
finest
beer
even
though
i
would
rate
as
above
average
i
love
this
brewery
and
cannot
wait
to
try
their
new
beers
medium
body
and
carbonation
o
they
really
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
might
as
well
just
be
an
amber
for
how
weak
it
tastes
my
least
favorite
ballast
point
beer
by
far
overall
not
bad
although
having
recently
sampled
pbr
pabst
in
a
can
no
less
i
actually
find
pbr
to
have
more
character
from
aroma
character
lingering
taste
appeal
i
think
the
pbr
revival
has
something
going
including
an
attractive
price
point
a
24
pack
at
13
goes
much
further
than
22
oz
at
5
ill
stick
with
sculpin
if
im
looking
for
real
character
as
a
pale
ale
as
the
label
states
on
its
label
its
not
but
as
a
kolsch
its
not
bad
i
have
had
beers
i
liked
better
it
states
that
its
fermented
at
ale
levels
but
its
more
of
a
kolsch
i
read
that
others
felt
misled
but
its
on
the
label
as
for
most
breweries
who
do
fantastic
hoppy
beers
this
one
falls
short
more
malt
than
anything
else
detected
its
crisp
but
it
also
has
the
funk
or
whatever
you
call
it
that
is
typical
of
kolsch
beers
for
the
price
i
can
get
just
as
good
kolsch
beers
that
are
actually
true
kolsch
so
for
me
its
a
one
and
done
but
i
still
love
ballast
points
hoppy
ipas
sculpin
is
just
about
perfect
and
among
my
all
time
favorite
beers
i
was
also
disappointed
as
many
others
here
that
the
packaging
does
not
represent
the
correct
product
this
is
a
great
session
beer
or
if
youre
eating
a
big
meal
but
other
than
that
there
is
no
reason
for
me
to
buy
this
again
very
little
to
no
hops
im
generally
fair
in
my
reviews
im
also
not
generally
lied
to
about
what
style
of
beer
im
purchasing
putting
pale
ale
in
big
print
and
kolsh
in
tiny
print
is
misleading
so
as
far
as
a
pale
ale
goes
this
beer
is
terrible
im
rating
it
as
a
pale
ale
because
it
says
thats
what
it
is
on
the
bottle
that
said
upfront
the
beer
is
mislabeled
when
i
think
of
a
pale
ale
i
tend
to
think
of
an
ipa
light
but
as
the
words
on
the
can
warn
this
is
more
of
a
kolsch
style
beer
that
said
for
the
style
its
damn
good
a
very
refreshing
and
crushable
beer
a
great
choice
to
enjoy
after
a
long
run
or
on
a
sunday
afternoon
bbq
tastes
like
a
very
well
done
budweiser
which
is
a
complement
in
my
book
while
i
would
normally
select
a
ipa
for
one
or
two
beers
with
a
meal
when
i
order
a
pitcher
of
half
priced
brew
i
normally
select
yellowtail
this
smooth
low
carbonated
product
is
a
great
pick
for
watching
23
hours
of
sports
in
a
bar
go
blackhawks
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
its
what
got
ballast
point
going
and
im
glad
they
stepped
up
their
game
in
just
about
everything
else
theyve
done
its
an
above
average
beer
for
sure
just
not
anything
that
blew
my
socks
off
this
would
be
excellent
with
seafood
like
mild
whitefish
shrimp
or
crab
id
say
try
this
if
you
are
new
to
the
craft
beer
scene
or
if
you
just
want
something
that
is
light
and
extremely
flavorful
you
wont
be
disappointed
i
was
expecting
an
american
pale
ale
but
this
is
actually
a
kolsch
with
a
distant
apa
background
still
faithful
to
style
and
well
crafted
received
as
part
of
xmas
exchange
its
a
pleasant
beer
you
just
want
to
drink
without
having
to
feel
the
need
to
taste
and
analyze
every
sip
it
goes
down
smooth
easy
to
put
down
a
six
pack
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
good
american
representation
of
the
german
kölsch
style

my

san

better

even
compare
this
to

pond
deschutes
but
still
so
unique
and
great
malt
but
balanced
actually
probably
not
appropriate
to
try
to
compare
overall
a
pretty
decent
take
on
the
german
kolsch
style
has
the
crisp
breadyness
you
expect
on
tap
at
toscana
cafe
pours
clear
golden
with
nearly
no

aroma
is
light

like

not
great
but
plenty
drinkable
i
guess
a
bit
to
much
on
the
sour
taste
for
a
pale
ale
for
me
not
really
what
i
think
of
when
i
grab
a
pale
ale
with
a
name
like
yellow
tail
pale
ale
i
was
expecting
a
pale
ale
not
a
pale
yellow
adjunct
but
that
is
exactly
what
this
portrays
the
body
the
scent
and
even
the
taste
is
all
adjunct
despite
the
claim
its
a
kolsch
i
smell
corn
i
taste
corn
and
the
pale
yellow
body
screams
adjunct
as
i
finish
it
theres
the
metallic
aftertaste
that
seems
to
always
accompany
an
adjunct
ballast
point
is
such
a
great
brewery
but
this
is
easily
their
worst
effort
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
smells
of
mild
grain
taste
starts
with
some
initial
light
caramel
sweetness
then
some
grain
husk
finishing
with
a
flowery
earthy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
but
not
too
bad
overall
a
good
beer
light
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
still
not
one
of
my
favorite
kolschs
o
a
good
take
on
the
kolsch
style
nothing
spectacular
but
a
solid
brew
that
i
could
drink
multiples
of
meager
yellowish
ale
pours
smoothly
kicking
up
a
white
foam
cap
sticky
and
leaves
substantial
lacing
sweetish
bready
lemony
and
yeasty
odor
tastes
of
crackers
lightly
sour
lemons
and
yeasty
mildly
sweet
a
bit
of
wet
earth
body
is
light
definitely
has
kolsch
elements
its
just
not
my
style
of
pale
ale
if
its
a
kolsch
why
not
call
it
one
instead
of
a
pale
ale
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
in
the
way
of
hops
but
now
reading
what
it
is
i
understand
im
still
pissed
though
as
i
wanted
a
true
apa
from
bp
as
a
kolsch
it
is
decent
enough
some
malt
sweetness
relatively
clean
some
breadycereal
notes
light
fruitiness
applespears
decent
for
the
style
but
still
pissed
this
is
not
an
apa
ill
rate
for
style
though
the
beer
is
clear
and
ligh
golden
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
brings
grain
earth
hops
malt
some
sweet
corn
character
in
the
flavor
a
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
some
wet
earth
character
dank
hops
and
lingering
bitterness
this
is
neither
a
good
kölsch
nor
pale
ale
it
certainly
lacks
the
attributes
of
either
style
too
sweet
one
beer
was
more
than
enough
not
again
o
yea
it
sucks
closer
to
rolling
rock
than
it
is
to
dales
pale
ale
or
any
of
the
other
greats
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
and
while
its
a
decent
pale
ale
it
fell
short
a
well
done
kolsch
easy
drinking
with
a
subtle
but
tasty
hop
profile
o
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
but
not
what
i
expected
from
a
beer
labeled
pale
ale
i
had
heard
it
was
more
of
a
kölsch
styled
brew
before
i
drank
it
but
my
eyes
read
pale
ale
and
i
wanted
a
pale
ale
when
i
cracked
it
open
strangely
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
it
had
been
labeled
kölsch
thanks
to
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
are
present
taste
is
crisp
malts
a
touch
of
hops
a
bit
of
wheat
pretty
refreshing
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
summertime
beer
o
the
clean
beer
has
lots
of
qualities
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
with
lots
of
field
corn
qualities
and
noble
hop
hints
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
like
it
its
not
loud
its
not
really
fruity
it
has
a
small
pucker
from
the
sweet
apple
and
thats
where
it
gets
its
sweetness
the
malt
sweetness
is
understated
and
behind
that
a
good
kolsch
reminds
you
that
malt
is
sweet
in
and
of
itself
without
caramel
toffee
or
sugar
the
malt
stayed
dry
and
breaddy
very
impressive
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
well
until
i
started
typing
this
i
had
no
idea
this
was
considered
a
kolsch
i
mean
why
would
they
call
it
a
pale
ale
if
it
was
another
style
altogether
it
does
explain
things
though
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
biscuit
flowers
and
a
hint
of
candied
orange
peel
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
with
more
of
the
orange
peel
and
some
mild
grass
for
good
measure
overall
a
decent
little
kolsch
and
a
sad
excuse
for
a
pale
ale
depending
on
how
you
wanna
look
at
it
false
advertising
pours
to
a
nice
but
thinnish
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
and
pale
gold
color
aroma
is
sweet
grainy
pale
malt
and
grassy
floral
hops
flavor
starts
slightly
sweet
with
a
dry
wine
and
noble
hops
finish
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
rough
for
the
style
overall
a
great
beer
that
is
pale
and
an
ale
but
is
nothing
like
a
pale
ale
i
ordered
it
not
knowing
it
was
a
kolsch
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
enjoy
ipas
more
than
pale
ales
and
can
still
enjoy
less
hoppy
ales
but
this
was
just
plain
bad
taste
follows
some
fruit
maybe
apple
and
lemon
just
a
touch
of
flowery
hops
uber
smooth
with
a
medium
carbonation
super
easy
to
drink
almost
downed
this
one
in
a
matter
of
minutes
very
light
crisp
and
refreshing
just
not
a
ton
of
personality
a
very
good
session
beer
or
warm
weather
beer
however
note
this
gets
a
2
61
as
a
kolsch
if
i
reviewed
it
as
an
apa
the
score
would
be
even
lower
overall
our
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
crisp
freshness
and
robust
flavoring
for
the
style
many
beers
in
the
style
go
too
far
with
the
drying
flour
bite
and
the
adjuncts
with
big
puckering
grassiness
and
further
drying
elements
of
straw
while
this
guy
teeters
on
the
edge
it
doesnt
go
overboard
in
these
aspects
making
for
a
decently
drinking
crisp
beverage
taste
is
of
bready
malts
hops
comes
through
in
the
finish
a
nice
brew
o
a
note
to
brewers
label
your
beers
with
the
correct
style
when
i
drank
this
i
was
expecting
an
apa
the
label
does
say
pale
ale
after
all
and
was
disappointed
on
my
notes
regarding
the
taste

picked
this
beer
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
cant
really
tell
why
its
called
a
pale
ale
on
the
bottle
but
i
digress
this
is
a
good
tasting
kolsch
and
definately
a
welcome
change
to
my
usual
fair
i
see
this
beer
as
a
summer
time
staple
due
to
its
lighter
body
and
taste
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
but
i
will
certainly
pick
up
other
variations
on
this
style
from
the
different
breweries
not
much
to
it
which
is
kind
of
the
point
of
a
kolsch
welldone
in
all
aspects
i
just
wish
they
wouldnt
call
it
a
pale
ale
very
nice
beer
an
excellent
example
of
a
kolsch
too
many
of
this
style
have
a
watery
aspect
or
lack
taste
or
are
just
plain
boring
this
is
good
i
likes
i
am
surprised
at
the
quality
of
this
beer
or
this
specific
bottle
as
i
like
other
ballast
point
beers
drinkability
is
very
solid
so
this
is
the
first
kolsch
i
have
ever
had
so
im
not
sure
if
how
i
rated
this
beer
is
completely
fair
i
will
revisit
this
beerreview
after
i
have
some
other
kolschs
to
compare
it
to
even
though
i
was
expecting
an
american
pale
ale
i
found
this
beer
pretty
enjoyable
crisp
bright
mouthfeel
which
is
to
be
expected
but
then
fades
to
a
cloudy
almost
musky
dryness
a
decent
representation
of
a
style
that
is
known
for
its
drinkability
so
i
would
consider
it
fairly
middle
of
the
road
for
this
category
another
delightful
offering
best
enjoyed
during
those
beautiful
summer
months
outside
and
from
the
bottle
d
i
got
through
about
half
the
glass
than
decided
i
didnt
want
it
anymoredrain
pour
whats
really
a
shame
about
this
for
me
is
that
it
is
my
first
disappointment
from
ballast
point
i
love
sculpin
big
eye
double
dorado
victory
at
sea
but
this
just
isnt
for
me
i
guess
every
brewery
has
to
have
their
beer
that
appeals
to
bmc
drinkers
and
this
is
it
unfortunately
its
on
the
same
tier
instead
of
a
step
upeven
though
its
supposed
to
be
a
completely
different
style
a
little
pricey
for
what
you
get
this
refreshing
kolsch
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
healthy
lacing
the
nose
give
off
some
hints
of
yeast
light
malty
breadiness
and
an
even
fainter
hop
aroma
in
the
background
when
you
first
sip
this
brew
there
is
a
nice
sweet
but
light
maltiness
that
is
followed
by
a
near
perfect
hop
balance
this
very
drinkable
kolsch
finishes
fairly
dry
with
a
light
abv
of
4
60
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
which
is
something
i
will
say
for
the
kolsch
style
in
general
yellowtail
pale
ale
is
solid
but
not
great
overall
an
excellent
kolsch
that
i
recommend
stands
out
from
the
other
kolschs
and
shows
what
the
style
can
be
a
couple
12ozers
or
on
22oz
is
enough
at
a
sitting
but
could
see
this
as
a
summer
staple
if
available
here
which
it
isnt
roatation
not
avail
here
in
tx
definite
tap
when
out
west
and
occasional
shipped
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
moderate
hop
aroma
and
clean
finish
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
its
crisp
and
clean
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
solid
pilsner
malt
composition
its
not
a
complex
brew
but
its
an
easy
drinker
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
summertime
brew
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
a
good
amount
of
crisp
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
but
thats
about
my
only
gripe
with
this
beer
drinkability
is
great
it
is
a
smooth
and
clean
flavorful
beer
that
can
be
sessioned
definately
something
i
can
get
use
to
drinking
more
often
d
could
be
a
great
summer
beer
if
you
dont
want
heavy
flavor
to
get
in
the
way
of
a
sixer
light
sizzly
carbonation
on
the
tongue
quick
and
easy
to
drink
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
fairlylarge
white
head
the
nose
has
a
lot
of
malt
especially
for
a
beer
being
labeled
as
a
kolsch
along
the
same
lines
this
is
pretty
hoppy
so
it
seems
like
bp
is
right
in
describing
this
as
a
pale
ale
bready
malt
and
some
citrus
hops
come
through
in
the
nose
and
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
refreshing
with
more
of
the
german
lagertype
carbonation
atop
this
softer
pale
ale
drinkability
is
good
overall
impression
an
unexpectedly
bold
but
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
d
a
solid
kolsch
but
i
really
prefer
the
classic
kolnmade
stuff
in
this
style
not
a
beer
where
being
overly
hoppy
is
a
virtue
poured
a
clean
amber
nice
lacing
smell
was
dominated
by
malts
and
a
touch
of
citrus
the
mouthfeel
and
the
taste
were
very
smooth
and
easy
on
the
palate
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
something
that
i
could
see
pounding
on
the
beach
in
san
diego
all
day
but
i
think
it
suffers
from
being
overshadowed
by
the
guys
at
stone
it
doesnt
stand
out
but
maybe
that
was
the
intentions
good
beer
though
d
this
beer
is
enjoyable
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
all
that
interesting
not
really
my
style
of
beer
but
not
bad
for
what
it
is
it
arrived
with
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
bright
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
although
that
is
redundant
when
using
the
term
bright
to
describe
a
beer
nose
had
an
interesting
tang
a
little
sweet
as
though
the
hops
and
yeast
were
fighting
it
out
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
sweetish
spicy
black
pepper
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
dry
but
not
overly
so
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
ligtwatery
but
still
good
and
easy
drinking
has
a
toastiness
with
some
subtle
wheat
and
nice
earthiness
to
it
for
a
socalled
pale
ale
id
like
it
to
be
a
bit
hoppier
but
as
a
kolsch
its
just
about
where
it
should
be
its
beer
hooray
beer
nah
its
quite
quaffable
but
nothing
special
next
d
a
decent
enough
beer
albeit
simple
and
light
i
was
somewhat
expecting
a
pale
ale
when
i
bought
the
sixer
and
was
slightly
disappointed
to
see
i
had
bought
a
kolsch
instead
not
bad
but
nothing
exciting
here
at
all
dpretty
tasty
and
light
solid
session
beer
d
drinkable
beer
but
the
only
time
id
want
to
was
a
very
hot
summer
day
worth
a
try
nicely
done
drinkability
sitting
at
only
4
6
its
a
beer
thats
easily
drinkable
although
the
flavor
and
aroma
is
mediocre
so
im
not
sure
that
its
something
i
want
to
pick
up
again
i
first
had
this
beer
at
a
pasta
cafe
on
coronado
in
san
diego
and
man
was
i
in
love
although
it
isnt
the
typical
english
style
pale
ale
but
a
german
kolsch
style
i
thought
it
was
so
good
they
could
of
called
it
a
porter
everything
about
this
beer
is
good
to
great
i
drank
so
much
of
it
this
summer
that
my
local
bevmo
started
stocking
it
in
the
fridges
there
i
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
decent
but
for
what
its
worth
i
havent
had
too
many
kolsch
styles
that
have
blown
me
away
drinkability
it
was
an
okay
drink
but
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
this
out
decent
drinkability
but
nothing
special
imo
poured
a
nice
hazy
carbonated
golden
yellow
with
a
good
head
floral
citrus
grassy
woody
and
brown
sugar
were
all
evident
in
the
nose
fairly
impressive
the
flavor
was
a
little
less
so
but
very
good
nonetheless
with
all
of
the
aforementioned
flavors
the
finish
was
a
dry
grassyness
impressively
complex
from
sip
to
sip
sometimes
tasting
like
a
weak
barleywine
mouthfeel
had
a
nice
carbonated
balance
definitely
good
for
a
session
12oz
poured
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
left
little
lacing
aromas
were
simple
with
some
hints
of
biscuity
malt
and
trace
citric
hop
tastes
were
crisp
with
notes
of
biscuity
malt
similar
to
other
ballast
point
offerings
mildly
fruity
with
a
slight
grassy
hop
bitterness
on
the
clean
finish
mouthfeel
was
thin
to
medium
but
creamy
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
well
balanced
and
represents
the
style
well
received
this
one
in
a
trade
not
a
huge
kolsch
fan
but
this
one
is
good
cloudy
yellowgold
body
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
sits
around
for
a
while
smells
like
a
lot
of
citrus
and
a
little
soapy
smell
at
the
end
very
drinkable
light
beer
with
an
earthy
bitter
flavor
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
delicious
kolsch
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
white
one
finger
head
aroma
is
of
lemon
hops
and
bread
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
and
matches
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
the
beer
is
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
decent
carbonation
it
is
also
somewhat
generic
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
nothing
which
stands
out
either
mediumhigh
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
on
the
palate
a
clean
and
dry
fiinish
makes
this
one
very
drinkable
enters
smooth
on
the
palate
and
finishes
nice
and
crisp
hmm
after
a
few
sips
i
seems
to
get
a
little
rough
and
grainybitter
sensation
on
the
palate
but
doesnt
happen
on
every
sip
nice
beer
actually
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
the
mouth
is
crisp
with
a
mediumhigh
amount
of
carbonation
flavor
is
of
buttered
biscuits
finished
with
a
sharp
hop
bite
this
is
one
of
the
more
refreshing
beers
ive
had
this

this
will
be
a
regular
for
barbecues
and
ballgames
d
the
extremely
low
abv
and
simple
flavors
make
this
one
a
lawn
mower
type
beer
however
i
still
wish
it
were
more
refreshing
like
the
style
typically
seems
to
be
medium
body
to
mediumlight
this
was
a
bomber
from
around
the
grill
and
it
was
perfect
great
drinkable
summer
beer
went
down
extremely
easy
and
had
no
harsh
edges
great
balance
between
the
sweet
and
dry
wtf
is
wrong
with
me
ivbe
been
staring
at
this
beer
on
the
shelves
for
abou
a
year
before
finally
pulling
the
trigger
and
buying
it
yesterday
well
worth
it
i
will
definitely
explore
other
offerings
from
these
guys
buy
this
hv
d
quite
refreshing
for
when
the
temps
get
up
there
dont
know
if
id
buy
it
again
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
at
a
partybbq
with
that
said
ive
gone
through
a
six
pack
of
bottles
in
which
each
bottle
produced
a
head
greater
in
volume
than
the
content
of
liquid
being
poured
into
the
glass
i
dont
know
how
that
happens
but
its
happened
consistently
here
md
light
to
medium
bodied
soft
carbonation
good
drinkability
overall
a
solid
beer
could
use
some
bolstering
in
the
aroma
and
taste
department
but
its
a
pretty
good
kolsch
despite
some
missing
elements
a
good
brew
worth
a
drink
or
two
every
now
and
then
overall
i
would
not
drink
this
again
and
the
flavors
put
me
off
i
have
not
had
another
beer
from
this
style
so
i
will
do
that
and
compare
and
see
if
its
the
style
i
do
not
like
d
sessionable
and
good
for
a
go
im
not
sold
on
the
kolsch
style
yet
as
ive
only
tried
two
in
the
style
but
this
does
not
make
me
jump
for
more
a
good
summer
beer
and
i
could
see
myself
taking
a
case
to
a
party
d
very
refreshing
and
at
4
60abv
this
is
one
beer
that
you
can
literally
get
lost
in
all
day
seemingly
perfect
for
the
style
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
well
this
beer
really
really
reminded
me
of
fat
tire
with
all
its
chocolaty
cake
flavors
and
over
the
top
malts
no
thats
not
bad
but
more
like
something
you
feel
like
once
in
a
while
not
bad
and
pretty
enjoyable
but
for
the
money
id
probably
go
with
fat
tire
my
personal
choice
give
it
a
try
its
still
a
decent
beer
with
good
flavors
cheers
too
bad
this
isnt
available
in
ga
yet
i
would
get
this
beer
all
throughout
the
summer
definitely
recommended
d
this
one
goes
down
easy
is
it
just
the
memories
conjured
up
by
my
authentic
fruh
glassware
nah
this
is
actually
a
refreshing
beer
well
balanced
nice
pilsner
character
pairing
with
a
floral
hop
profile
not
quite
a
worldclass
example
but
a
damn
fine
beer
none
the
less
pours
a
little
hazytranslucent
golden
with
average
white
head
that
has
some
decent
retention
nose
is
faint
citrus
herbal
and
light
melon
palate
offers
a
nice
herbal
dry
character
and
somewhat
dirty
on
the
finish
refreshing
and
rather
easy
drinking
pairs
well
with
french
bread
yellowtail
pale
ale
is
easily
the
most
disappointing
beer
ive
had
from
ballast
point
first
of
all
the
name
is
a
little
misleading
at
least
in
my
opinion
to
be
fair
it
says
its
a
kolsch
but
i
wasnt
holding
the
bottle
when
i
ordered
it
over
the
interwebz
small
gripe
more
substantively
the
nose
is
very
weak
its
way
short
on
flavor
and
is
way
too
damn
dry
i
recognize
that
kolsch
is
a
tough
style
to
pull
off
but
this
ones
not
really
close
to
a
good
take
on
it
if
crossed
with
the
opportunity
to
pick
up
another
bottle
id
probably
pass
id
suggest
you
do
the
same
drinkability
average
very
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
ive
had
many
other
pales
with
a
ton
more
flavor
there
again
is
the
kolsch
thing
would
not
drink
again
d
pretty
decent
this
isnt
an
awardwinning
beer
but
you
could
surely
do
worse
on
these
beastly
southern
summer
afternoons
d
nice
and
refreshing
this
is
a
relatively
bitter
pale
ale
great
if
your
a
hop
head
and
if
you
like
ballast
points
big
eye
ipa
this
beer
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
but
certainly
flavorful
as
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
as
a
snowy
day
in
january
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
easily
drink
all
day
poured
a
weak
looking
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
a
very
little
foam
and
no
lace
the
smell
of
citrus
filled
the
nose
with
a
nice
aroma
the
taste
was
of
a
grapefruit
and
light
flavored
hops
nice
balance
of
bitterness
that
feels
like
a
citrus
type
of
bitterness
i
do
think
that
this
pale
ale
tastes
better
when
it
cold
and
not
while
it
warms
up
ok
not
bad
the
pale
ale
label
is
misleading
however
anyway
seems
some
of
my
previous
reviews
for
kolsch
might
need
some
updating
will
have
to
retry
a
fresh
reissdorf
for
comparison
the
mouthfeel
strikes
me
as
starchier
than
expected
its
rough
hopforward
flavor
exhibits
lemon
tartness
and
pale
german
malt
the
hops
give
character
where
the
grains
merely
balance
very
spicy
bitterness
this
would
be
a
very
nice
summer
pounder
but
the
lemon
flavor
is
a
little
too
onedimensional
i
have
to
agree
with
the
previous
reviewers
description
this
one
is
very
biscuity
and
the
floral
hops
are
a
perefect
accessory
to
the
malt
hints
of
sweetness
along
with
everything
else
make
for
a
slightly
unusual
but
quite
refreshing
and
delicious
beer
this
is
for
sure
not
a
dieseldorf
but
very
good
in
its
own
right
another
quality
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
wish
would
focus
on
their
strengths
and
not
what
they
think
the
masses
want
one
of
the
better
american
examples
of
the
style
and
very
sessionable
the
body
is
light
and
easy
drinking
some
chalky
notes
linger
in
the
mouthfeel
though
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
as
well
and
could
help
if
more
with
carbonic
bite
overall
a
easy
drinking
beer
but
misses
its
mark
on
being
a
kolsch
would
like
to
see
more
of
a
german
malt
taste
but
hey
pale
golden
with
medium
fizzy
head
not
as
good
as
youd
expect
for
lacing
or
retention
big
slow
bubbles
of
carbonation
rising
up
smell
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
grainy
a
little
sour
lemon
taste
is
pretty
good
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggests
some
earthy
hops
come
in
with
big
biscuit
and
grain
a
bit
of
lemon
again
and
a
touch
of
honey
still
a
decent
sweetness
all
along
light
mouthfeel
with
a
little
dryness
in
the
finish
sweet
and
bready
not
extremely
drinkable
a
pint
or
two
maybe
every
time
i
try
a
kolsch
i
think
of
a
charleston
classic
tough
competition
this
is
fast
becoming
my
everyday
beer
of
choice
its
drinkability
is
quite
excellent
although
the
kölsch
has
been
thought
of
as
more
of
a
warmweather
brew
i
could
definitely
enjoy
this
one
yearround
it
may
not
be
as
bold
as
other
styles
but
thats
where
its
beauty
lies
worth
trying
for
sure
a
go
to
beer
for
many
of
my
noncraft
beer
friends
when
i
drag
them
out
and
a
big
money
maker
for
ballast
point
allowing
them
crazy
folk
to
tinker
elsewhere

anywho
a
decent

weird
my
package
store
just
got
this
in
as
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
winter
type
brew
in
fact
its
the
exact
opposite
theres
intense
carbonation
in
this
bad
boy
i
had
trouble
pouring
it
without
the
head
spilling
over
maybe
my
bottle
was

very
light
bodied
with
a
nice

it
some

are
there
but
it
drinks
like
a

as
the
bottle
states
pale

nah
not
enough
hops
for
that
not
something
id
buy
again
but

the

not
realizing
that
this
was
a
kolsch
style
pa
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
underpowered
in
the
hop
department
upon
reading
the
label
and
realizing
the
style
being
attempted
i
find
this
to
be
quite
nice
and
balanced
a
touch
of

by
an
equal

heavier
than
normal
for
the

yet
it
is
crisp

overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
another
finely
crafted
beer
by
one
of
the
lesser
known
san

breweries
definitely
worth
a
shot
for
a
change

pace
notes
from
6305
drinkability
im
not
really
a
kölsch
man
but
i
could
drink
these
for
a
while
kind
of
like
flavored
water
with
alcohol
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
btw
head
retention
is
above
average
and
theres
some
nice
lacing
this
would
be
a
nice
everyday
beer
for
those
who
can
get
it
locally
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
and
thought
the
x
blew
it
out
of
the
water
i
would
not
recommend
it
nor
would
i
buy
it
again
refresing
with
a
nice
afterglow
not
really
memorable
on
the
tongue
though
probably
not
a
bomber
type
beer
nice
try
but
maybe
not
their
style
clear
bright
pale
gold
with
a
white
collar
and
thin
skim
of
very
fine
bubbles
coating
the
surface
of
the
beer
even
with
a
meager
head
there
was
still
spotty
lacing
fruity
aroma
oranges
grassy
citrus
rind
cakey
but
fairly
mild
overall
moderate
bitterness
with
a
fruity
sweetness
basically
the
same
character
as
found
in
the
aroma
lingering
citrus
oil
bitterness
light
bodied
and
dry
with
moderate
carbonation
fairly
crisp
quite
drinkable
and
nicely
balanced
with
hops
and
bitterness
just
surpassing
the
sweetness
solid
overall
the
taste
is
light
but
zesty
and
intriguing
grain
crackers
citrus
7up
hints
of
grass
and
pine
light
sweetness
and
balancing
bitterness
it
has
great
balance
and
is
quenching
not
as
easy
drinking
as
one
might
think
the
substantial
malt
profile
more
or
less
overwhelms
the
light
hop
character
of
grass
flowers
and
fruits
and
keeps
this
one
from
being
a
porch
swinglawnmower
beer
im
not
entirely
sold
on
the
kolsch
description
of
this
beer
if
only
because
there
is
a
bit
less
spiceness
a
bit
less
fruitiness
and
more
earthy
hops
that
make
this
a
bit
of
a
cross
between
a
modest
apa
and
a
rather
weakish
ipa
the
kolsch
description
is
more
of
a
stretch
for
me
the
beer
was
a
very
refreshing
decently
carbonated
slightly
floral
beer
that
went
down
smoothly
it
was
unexceptional
but
i
did
like
things
more
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
settled
and
then
some
residual
dryness
and
nuttiness
emerged
i
would
go
at
this
again
just
to
see
if
my
initial
trepidation
with
the
kolsch
labeling
holds
true
at
at
later
date
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
is
perfect
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
summer
day
recommended
d
this
reminds
me
of
the
cereals
that
i
loved
as
a
kid
and
for
that
it
gets
an
a
in
my
book
this
is
an
oddball
brew
especially
for
the
usually
unassuming
style
this
shit
was
12
for
the
six
pack
in
fort
collins
co
but
i
can
see
why
this
is
good
beer
great
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
i
will
buy
it
more
often
thanks
for
coming
to
pa
this
is
a
near
perfect
beer
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
light
refreshing
ale
with
some
character
d
i
really
like
this
beer
all
the
flavors
are
subdued
but
they
work
very
well
together
this
beer
does
down
easy
and
is
very
refreshing
to
me
this
particular
brew
by
ballast
lacks
the
brightness
and
crisp
taste
of
other
kolsch
brews
and
if
labled
as
a
pale
ale
i
still
would
think
the
overall
flavor
subdued
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
though
in
fact
this
might
be
a
good
beer
to
start
a
macrodrinker
into
craft
beer
its
not
too
agressively
flavored
that
it
would
scare
anyone
off
i
think
i
like
kölsch
this
one
is
a
very
crisp
very
clean
and
refreshing
semisweet
malt
that
has
a
subtle
cloverhoney
current
with
a
dry
wheat
and
herbal
hop
balance
yummy
and
amazingly
drinkable
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
take
it
along
on
your
next
fishing
trip
or
bbq
update

id
just
add
that
theres
an
interesting
popcorn
aroma
and
pleasant
mineral
character
to
the
flavor
and
water
on
tap
at
lahainas
in
pacific
beach
clear
golden
color
with
no
almost
no
head
tastes
more
like
a
pilsener
than
an
pale
light
floral
aroma
with
just
a
bit
of
citrus
i
drank
about
3
pitchers
of
this
beer
just
sitting
out
on
the
patio
at
lahainas
on
a
beautiful
night
yes
its
light
of
nature
and
character
and
sometimes
that
makes
for
a
fine
session
beer
but
in
this
case
it
makes
for
more
of
a
boring
beer
theres
just
not
enough
there
to
make
it
notable
or
especially
desirable
in
any
real
way
it
does
drink
easily
enough
but
theres
not
a
lot
of
reward
for
the
effort
as
minimal
as
it
may
be
and
the
downside
to
a
bomber
is
i
just
might
doze
off
before
i
finish
it
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
kolschstyle
ales
that
ive
ever
had
i
liked
the
hop
kick
that
it
had
a
crisp
light
beer
flavor
is
very
mild
and
subdued
overall
nothing
extraordinary
though
drinkability
is
ruined
by
the
persistent
metallic
taste
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
whiteish
head
that
wastes
no
time
in
falling
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
and
smooth
noticeable
grain
attributes
but
that
sweet
aftertaste
sticks
with
you
for
quite
some
time
feel
has
a
biting
carbonation
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
have
to
say
this
kölsch
style
is
growing
on
me
lately
drinkability
a
little
maltier
than
would
be
expected
for
the
kölsch
style
when
i
reviewed
this
on
tap
i
was
overly
critical
as
i
thought
it
was
a
pale
ale
pours
a
clear
yellowstraw
with
a
large
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
the
smell
is
somewhat
pungent
with
bread
yeast
and
floral
scents
the
taste
is
lightcrispand
clean
with
bread
yeasthopsand
floral
flavors
the
mf
is
light
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
a
nice
light
summer
beer
with
alot
of
taste
drinkability
havent
had
many
of
this
style
but
it
went
down
easy
enough
decent
enough
to
try
light
body
watery
finish
lightly
carbonated
this
wouldnt
be
the
first
beer
id
reach
for
but
it
is
innocent
enough
to
enjoy
no
flaws
but
no
curiosities
either
pours
a
clear
rich
yellow
with
minimal
head
smell
is

inviting
taste
is
a
rich
blend
of
sweet
malt
on
the
front
with
a
decent
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
slighly
chewy
drinkability
is
enhanced
by
the
creaminess
and
light
hop
finish
surprisingly
had
never
tasted
this
one
until
yesterday
not
one
of
ballast
points
best
by
any
means
but
not
bad
for
its
style
might
drink
again
especially
in
the
summer
time
worth
trying
very
clear
pale
gold
in
color
very
thin
head
but
has
some
lacing
smell
is
reminds
me
of
the
bmc
crowd
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
but
leaves
a
yeastiness
lingering
light
on
the
hops
carbonation
is
ok
but
not
great
not
too
bad
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
better
d
for
a
kolsch
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
it
is
not
a
crisp
and
refreshing
as
i
would
expect
drinkbaility
definite
session
beer
here
i
was
surprised
the
label
states
pale
ale
but
the
liner
notes
explain
this
is
a
kolsch
tasty
and
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
hell
of
a
session
brew
very
tasty
and
i
could
see
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
though
not
quite
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
some
more
classic
examples
of
a
kolschstyle
beer
imo

i
personally
find
it
confusing
when
a
brewery
puts
out
a
pale
ale
that
actually
is
a
kolsch
beer
anyway
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
enough
light
sipper
nothing
special
going
on
here
d
an
extremely
clean
crisp
drinking
pale
with
a
wet
citrusy
nature
makes
this
a
classic
example
and
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
pours
perfectly
clear
with
a
beautiful
bright
gold
hue
but
no
head
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
pretty
mild
just
some
clear
pale
german
style
malts
and
a
dusting
of
hops
on
the
palate
surprisingly
rich
almost
chewy
malt
content
that
nonetheless
remains
light
both
hops
and
carbonation
provide
a
sharp
and
balancing
counterpoint
to
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
the
style
or
at
least
the
american
version
of
the
style
as
its
a
bit
thicker
and
bigger
than
the
original
kolsches
overall
though
this
is
quite
nice
its
not
a
bold
incredibly
complex
beer
but
it
is
drinkable
and
satisfying
and
doesnt
sport
any
flaws
well
done
d
this
one
was
boring
to
me
and
was
not
fun
to
drink
its
an
easy
drinker
and
sessionable
but
nothing
exciting
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild

very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
very

to

for
and

crisp
refreshing
with
a
decent
bite
to
it
reminiscent
of
a
pilsner
a
bit
dryer
than
most
kolsches
and
light
to
medium
carbonation
one
of
the
better
ones
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
nice
yellow
straw
color
with
a
rocky
puffy
head
it
also
had
a
musty
smell
to
it
the
flavor
was
some
must
subtle
fruitiness
and
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
i
could
see
drinking
a
couple
of
these
while
doing
yard
work
then
again
i
would
probably
just
buy
the
big
eye
ipa
instead
d
i
purchased
this
beer
at
a
vons
close
to
my
san
diego
resort
and
was
unable
to
find
a
freshness
date
or
code
to
find
if
i
was
drinking
old
beer
ballast
point
has
such
a
great
rep
that
i
hope
it
was
old
and
not
them
i
will
give
this
one
another
shot
if
i
can
get
it
in
the
future
this
brew
is
a
slightly
hazy
straw
gold
color
nice
sized
white
head
floats
above
light
malt
on
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
hops
mostly
light
malt
on
the
taste
a
nice
kiss
of
floral
hops
very
refreshing
brew
too
bad
they
dont
offer
these
in
six
packs
around
here
you
could
put
down
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
summer
day
it
doesnt
finish
clean
and
dry
which
is
another
thing
i
would
expect
leaves
a
bit
of
a
greasy
feeling
in
the
mouth
this
is
just
a
mediocre
beer
regardless
of
style
no
real
head
the
mouthfeel
is
flat
and
thin
and
there
is
a
sour
aftertaste
that
is
neither
pleasant
nor
well
integrated
with
the
flavor
of
the
beer
and
the
beer
itself
has
no
real
hops
no
maltbackbone
and
other
real
flavors
to
speak
of
just
not
good
at
all

a

and
the

helps
it
go
down

a

but
maybe
its
because
they
call
it
a
pale

it
might
be
a

in

this
beer
would
not
pass

i
bought
this
thinking
is
was
a
pale
ale
wrong
not
really
a
fan
of
kolsch
brews
d
you
would
think
with
the
inoffensive
taste
this
brew
would
be
pretty
drinkable
but
i
find
myself
not
wanting
to
ever
pick
up
another
glass
after
the
first
it
only
seems
a
bit
better
than
something
id
pick
up
in
a
cheap
18
pack
at
the
liquor
store
quite
dissapointing
for
a
craft
brew
searching
searching
no
thats
all
i
have
to
say
on
this
a
soapy
head
forms
on
top
of
this
golden
ale
albeit
one
that
doesnt
last
too
long
but
it
does
the
job
on
a
pleasant
warm
day
its
semisweet
with
some
hop
grape
and
bready
flavors
the
crispness
is
light
and
finishes
a
touch
dry
a
great
beer
to
have
when
the
weather
is
too
much
to
have
something
big
bready
and
biscuit
malt
flavors
a
tinge
of
lemony
hops
slight
bitterness
towards
the
edges
of
the
tongue
a
bit
bland
with
not
much
going
on
thicker
body
then
i
expected
as
i
was
looking
for
something
more
crisp
and
cleaner
slick
through
the
mouth
leaving
a
trail
of
buttery
ooze
behind
again
like
the
aromas
the
flavors
are
just
middle
of
the
road
nothing
stands
out
here
a
mediocre
brew
at
best
though
actually
quite
drinkable
despite
its
pedestrian
disposition
not
bad
not
great
either
i
had
no
trouble
drinking
this
one
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
ok
but
something
off
in
taste
or
smell
could
be
that
this
is
not
a
fast
mover
at
the
marriott
i
would
be
willing
to
try
again
based
on
brewers
reputation
but
not
in
any
great
hurry

have
to
give
this

a
good
because
it
is
drinkable
and
is
one
i
could
have
after
mowing
the
lawn
if
i
had
a
lawn
this
is
a
great
western
take
on
a
traditional
european
style
its
really
quite
good
the
name
is
confusing
though
as
this
is
definitely
not
your
typical
california
pale
ale
and
the
text
on
the
label
clearly
calls
it
a
golden
kolsch
weird
i
probably
wont
drink
it
again
but
if
youre
into
this
style
ide
highly
recommend
it
if
you
can
find
this
fresh
and
like
the
style
its
worth
a
try
very
nicely
integrated
beer
poured
from
a
22oz
this
beer
is
very
clear
with
a
light
orange
tint
there
was
a
decent
head
that
faded
away
after
a
minute
or
two
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
very
nice
a
light
citrus
fruit
that
was
unexpected
the
tastemouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
yet
not
bad
it
is
very
light
on
the
tongue
not
really
much
malt
flavor
and
leaves
a
slightly
tangy
finish
that
fades
about
15
seconds
later
to
a
earthy
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
beer
very
drinkable
this
was
an
good
tasting
kolsch
style
beer
has
the
potential
to
be
a
good
beer
so
maybe
ill
try
another
bottle
at
some
point
however
if
this
is
the
norm
for
this
beer
then
ill
have
to
pass
medium
body
with
crisp
refreshing
carbonation
the
abv
makes
this
very
sessionable
ballast
point
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
nothing
absolutely
outstanding
but
every
one
very
solid
this
beer
is
a
little
lighter
than
typical
there
is
a
foamy
head
the
smell
is
similar
to
a
lighter
beer
combined
with
a
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
a
bad
bitter
not
a
very
desirable
beer
this
is
kinda
hard
to
drink
i
dont
think
this
beer
will
be
in
my
cabinet
again
this
is
a
style
i
dont
really
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
but
this
beer
motivates
me
to
explore
more
what
a
good
refreshing
beert
highly
drinkable
and
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
a
really
pleasant
nutty
malt
and
for
an
ale
it
is
really
smooth
bordering
on
a
lager
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
so
i
dont
have
anthing
to
compare
it
to
but
i
really
like
it
d
this
is
a
good
summer
brew
refreshing
with
good
flavor
ill
reach
for
this
when
i
need
to
cool
down
and
unwind
the
beer
has
a
fairly
light
taste
to
it
in
fact
it
is
almost
completely
dry
the
hops
almost
get
it
a
tangy
tartness
though
and
there
is
a
noticeable
herbal
hop
character
found
throughout
this
beer
the
flavor
almost
reminds
me
of
those
exotic
yet
mellow
basils
e
g
cinnamon
basil
but
that
is
not
quite
it
a
light
lemonlike
note
is
here
as
well
as
some
spicy
hop
notes
this
is
not
your
typical
american
pale
ale
but
i
really
like
its
hop
leanings
light
and
quaffable
as
well
and
it
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
22oz
bottle
it
has
a
smell
of
malty
cider
and
is
quite
woody
the
taste
is
a
dry
full
flavored
caramel
with
some
nuttiness
cedarlike
finish
extremely
drinkable
a
little
too
chalky
in
the
mouthfeel
d
eh
so
why
dont
they
bottle
the
dipa
nothing
memorable
just
a
middle
of
the
road
quaffer
id
drink
again
if
offerd
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
quite
a
tasty
beer
that
was
light
in
body
had
a
good
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
modest
abv
making
it
a
very
easy
beer
to
enjoy
i
happily
recommend
this
one

notes
i
like
some
hops
to
balance
out
a
good
kolsch
this
stays
on
the
bready
side
all
the
way
through
and
it
leans
towards
doughy
good
malt
character
delicate
finish
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
an
approachable
offering
with
some
depth
light
bodied
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
but
overall
pretty
bleh
and
plain
yellowtail
pale
ale
is
a
decent
kolsch
that
doesnt
put
any
kind
of
a
serious
scare
into
the
worlds
best
versions
after
enjoying
big
eye
ipa
it
was
my
hope
that
this
one
would
be
just
as
good
no
such
luck
while
i
dont
have
any
desire
to
throw
it
back
i
wont
be
mounting
it
above
my
mantle
either
overall
impression
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
i
always
like
it
when
beers
that
were
previously
bombers
only
show
up
in
six
packs
this
would
be
a
great
choice
for
any
springsummer
activity

dry

up

and
a

finish
typical
pale

imo
nothing
too
exciting
but
still
a
great
offering
from
a
good
san
diego
brewery
give
it
a
try
when
you
find
it
had
a
yard
of
this
at
ohungrys
in
old
town
yesterday
and
was
very
impressed
it
poured
a
nice
medium
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
left
some
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
refreshing
with
a
crisp
hop
scent
the
flavor
was
equally
as
smoothe
and
crisp
with
a
slight
hop
kick
that
was
more
balanced
towards
the
slighty
spicy
malt
profile
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
just
goes
to
show
that
you
can
make
a
very
light
and
drinkable
beer
and
still
have
a
great
flavor
tasted
at
the
orange
blossom
festival
in
riverside
california
served
very
cold
on
a
cold
rainy
day
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
minimal
head
aroma
flavor
follow
each
other
fairly
well
there
is
a
nice
hops
balanced
with
a
light
citrusy
and
buttery
tones
a
complete
lack
of
sweetness
drinkability
is
well
lets
put
it
this
way
my
notes
say
yes
a
super
drinkable
brew
very
mild
brew
the
beer
after
splitting
from
the
22
ounce
bottle
pours
a
translucent
and
lustrous
gold
with
the
head
large
and
bright
white
with
a
pleasing
creamy
texture
lace
a
fine
silky
curtain
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
malt
crisp
and
fresh
with
the
start
nicely
malted
lightly
sweet
and
the
top
fair
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
equable
in
its
acidity
the
hops
are
pleasing
but
a
bit
mild
the
aftertaste
quite
dry
and
a
fine
session
beer
it
will
make
very
drinkable
this
was
an
excellent
session
beer
this
is
a
light
golden
colour
with
a
fluffy
head
of
allwhite
foam
the
aromas
are
slightly
fruity
with
nice
roasted
malts
and
slight
citrusyfloral
hops
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
super
light
and
refreshing
you
can
really
tell
that
this
is
a
low
alcohol
brew
that
is
crafted
with
the
utmost
care
and
passion
truly
artisinal
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
bordering
on
great
and
the
drinkability
is
nice
for
this
new
age
kolsch
as
well
a
good
solid
brew
overall
a
good
kolsch
thats
a
decent
beer
on
a
warm
day
a
clean
and
crisp
brew
that
really
hits
the
spot
the
goldenhued
body
has
a
nice
head
and
laces
well
the
nose
is
malty
and
bready
with
a
good
sense
of
grain
there
is
nice
flavor
from
the
malting
and
the
feel
is
quite
light
and
crisp
giving
a
very
nice
snappy
finish
easily
drinkable
in
some
volume
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
brew
i
found
yellowtail
pale
ale
to
be
a
delightful
beer
this
is
a
lawnmower
beer
thats
all
slightly
sweet
on
the
tongue
w
a
little
bite
it
has
no
aroma
the
appearance
is
clear
yellow
w
a
small
head
you
wont
find
much
flavor
here
overall
labeled
as
a
pale
ale
in
the
style
of
a
cologne
kölsch
it
is
certainly
a
decent
effort
the
malt
aspect
is
crisp
and
light
hops
are
refreshing
not
a
bad
effort
at
all
medium
yellow
color
medium
head
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
a
medium
bodied
ale
malts
are
mild
fruity
and
kind
of
sweet
hops
are
present
but
kind
of
hidden
they
pop
out
at
you
every
once
in
a
while
very
smooth
more
of
a
kolsch
than
a
pale
ale
its
a
great
hot
daylawnmover
beer
mild
and
interesting
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
advertised
as
a
kolschstyle
one
should
expect
this
to
be
less
a
west
coast
pale
than
ballast
points
other
offering
the
beer
is
a
clear
very
light
copper
in
color
with
a
very
thin
head
aroma
is
mild
wheaty
and
suffused
with
german
hops
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
rich
for
such
a
crispfeeling
body
with
a
raw
grainy
malt
and
an
earthyherbal
hop
very
dry
finish
a
refreshing
yet
substantial
beer
and
a
nice
entry
in
a
style
which
admittedly
i
tend
to
find
a
bit
uninspiring
this
different
pale
ale
has
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
there
is
a
hint
of
ester
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
a
good
sweet
smooth
malt
presence
this
brew
is
more
reminiscent
of
a
tasty
golden
ale
the
only
really
noticeable
hop
presence
is
a
bit
of
a
bitterness
in
the
finish
notes
decent
go
at
the
kölsch
style
quite
palatable
with
an
impressive
malt
character
for
such
a
light
coloured
brew
nice
addition
of
hops
to
make
for
a
perfect
balance
i
enjoy
a
good
pale
ale
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
had
it
shipped
for
the
holidays
and
i
was
the
hit
of
the
party
very
drinkable
very
balanced
everything
you
can
hope
for
in
an
ale
the
bros
call
this
beer
world
class
im
not
sure
about
that
it
is
an
excellent
koelsch
though
i
poured
it
from
the
bottle
into
a
koelsch
glass
looks
like
a
koelsch
should
its
got
a
good
bitterness
to
it
with
some
herbal
and
floral
flavors
first
of
this
style
reminds
me
of
a
goldencream
ale
good
and
malty
light
with
a
hint
if
corn
great
for
a
summer
day
o
good
beer
looking
to
revisit
some
of
the
lighter
styles
in
2015
ok
but
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
flavor
compared
to
actual
style
3
945
excellent
example
of
an
underrated
style
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
and
just
a
little
lace
aroma
is
of
bready
grains
with
hints
or
fruit
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
fruiter
than
is
typical
for
this
style
some
hints
of
grain
and
a
nice
sweet
finish
really
good
o
not
much
experience
with
the
kolsch
style
but
this
will
persuade
me
to
try
a
few
others
this
is
off
the
chain
good
and
i
will
be
buying
more
m
e
hit
this
out
of
the
park
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
super
easy
drinking
and
very
crisprefreshing
per
the
style
it
is
pretty
mild
and
clean
if
you
want
a
beer
you
can
down
a
sixer
of
with
no
regrets
this
is
the
one
o
an
excellent
kolsch
got
this
one

2014
really
enjoying
this
fantastic
styled
beer
true
to
form
nice
example
of
the
style
very
refreshing
pours
a
pretty
foggy
yellow
white
head
nose
is
airy
grass
seems
almost
like
lemon
on
there
too
which
comes
on
the
flavor
profile
as
well
beyond
that
its
fairly
crisp
though
it
seems
somewhat
unfiltered
kind
of
grassy
very
mild
earth
tone
a
nice
drinker
this
style
gets
chopped
up
pretty
badly
a
lot
but
this
is
a
nice
example
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
pale
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
thin
clingy
frothy
white
layer
of
head
aromas
of
toast
and
peppery
hops
light
and
clean
on
the
nose
flavors
are
toasted
forward
with
a
bolt
of
pepper
and
dry
resinous
hops
very
clean
and
extremely
balanced
palate
the
aftertaste
is
more
heavily
toasted
with
cut
grass
and
bitter
characteristics
the
finish
is
dry
clean
and
crisp
o
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
and
an
exercise
in
care
and
subtlety
and
it
had
to
be
given
the
transparency
of
the
style
and
the
ease
with
which
it
can
be
flubbed
if
you
dont
like
this
then
you
just
dont
like
kolschs
taste
is
complex
immediately
great
hits
of
almost
champagneylike
grapes
though
the
carbonation
may
be
fooling
with
me
mild
alcohol
notes
tastes
extremely
clean
all
the
way
through
the
first
taste
to
the
aftertaste
extremely
refreshing
really
like
this
one
especially
with
waning
summer
months
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
a
bit
light
and
bland
for
my
tastes
though
pour
from
bottle
thin
head
a
little
hazy
mild
carbination
nice
aroma
light
fruit
nothing
over
the
top
but
set
off
this
beer
from
others
enjoyed
the
taste
light
crisp
but
also
some
complimentary
notes
of
hops
malt
and
yeast
overally
a
very
drinkable
refreshing
beer
that
also
has
some
depth
and
interest
vs
others
seems
to
be
a
very
good
representation
of
the
kolsch
style
i
would
buy
again
o
another
enjoyable
brew
from
mother
earth
these
guys
make
some
really
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
beers
super
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
matched
well
with
the
blt
and
black
bean
burgers
at
lunch
overall
a
real
solid
kölsch
and
probably
one
of
the
few
that
ive
had
that
reminds
me
of
ones
that
are
german
always
in
search
of
the
ultimate
kölsch
the
kwest
continues
in
earnest
a
new
style
of
beer
for
me
and
not
one
that
hit
the
spot
obviously
others
liked
this
beer
but
it
did
not
suit
my
taste
perhaps
it
sat
in
the
growler
too
long
i
went
skiing
in
montana
and
left
it
in
the
fridge
opened
will
have
to
revisit
kolschs
in
the
future
to
make
a
final
decision
this
beer
pours
up
a
pale
straw
with
not
much
head
and
almost
no
lacing
it
is
clear
enough
to
read
a
newspaper
through
smell
is
malt
biscuit
grasses
and
floral
taste
is
pretty
sweet
upfront
followed
by
a
nice
but
mildly
tangy
finish
not
a
whole
lot
of
hops
to
it
but
still
nice
not
every
beer
has
to
be
some
massive
hop
bomb
to
be
good
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
without
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
not
too
shabby
especially
if
you
are
looking
for
something
that
is
very
sessionable
overall
though
not
the
best
take
on
a
kolsch
in
the
region
coast
handily
has
that
distinction
this
is
easily
drinkable
and
better
than
i
was
expecting
based
on
the
aroma
o
honestly
one
of
the
best
kolschs
i
have
ever
had
phenomenal
o
a
sweet
beer
with
strong
wheat
and
corn
flavor
only
a
hint
of
hops
lurking
somewhere
a
very
drinkable
summer
brew
to
be
sure
but
not
a
standout
in
its
style
i
was
intrigued
by
the
grainlike
taste
that
i
cannot
describe
better
than
strawlike
but
not
in
any
sort
of
negative
sense
interesting
overall
fairly
impressed
most
places
try
to
go
overboard
with
a
kolsch
or
way
under
and
it
has
no
flavor
for
an
ale
this
is
loaded
with
lager
like
flavors
which
is
great
for
a
kolsch
nice
malts
soft
almost
decoction
layered
feel
and
interesting
fruit
flavor
that
gives
and
interesting
and
weird
slight
tangy
like
flavor
o
overall
this
was
a
nice
kolsch
not
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
but
its
still
pretty
good
full
bodied
flavor
with
biscuit
notes
that
matures
into
a
noble
hop
finish
and
a
clean
aftertaste
carbonation
is
a
little
high
in
my
eyes
but
i
realize
that
is
being
true
to
the
style
a
lot
to
like
here
overall
not
a
thin
yellow
lager
this
has
complexity
and
drinkability
and
certainly
qualifies
as
refreshing
as
well
im
not
sure
id
drink
it
mowing
the
lawn
but
certainly
after
i
held
for
a
long
time
to
try
this
new
brewery
out
and
was
not
disappointed
glad
to
get
fresh
batches
being
only
an
hour
away
o
a
very
distinct
style
of
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
usually
beers
this
light
do
not
have
strong
flavors
but
this
beer
in
particular
is
full
flavored
and
very
tasty
drinkability
a
pretty
good
kölsch
great
way
to
end
the
work
day
at
the
beer
store
endless
river
is
a
great
session
beer
best
cold
but
still
enjoyable
after
warmth
o
im
not
overly
familiar
with
the
kolsch
style
but
this
seems
in
line
with
the
style
description
being
in
nc
id
be
happy
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
this
summer
rich
malty
aroma
has
caramel
and
earthy
notes
and
a
hint
of
molasses
it
pours
a
clear
solar
yellow
with
a
fairly
thick
if
not
too
persistent
white
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
flavor
fills
the
mouth
with
malt
that
has
caramel
earthy
and
edgy
bitter
hoppy
underpinnings
lively
texture
has
a
little
more
than
average
body
and
leaves
a
subtle
tingle
kolsch
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
the
hop
character
is
great
and
it
drinks
well
no
head
to
speak
of
clear
yellow
amber
and
minimal
lace
straw
scent
not
pronounced
delicately
understated
fresh
light
barley
flavor
with
a
pleasant
almost
metallic
aftertaste
not
flat
but
not
zippy
either
overall
a
fairly
good
beer
that
is
worth
trying
most
likely
in
warmer
weather
not
as
soft
as
a
real
kolch
most
likely
due
to
water
overall
this
was
a
nice
light
refreshing
kölsch
although
nothing
special
really
stuck
out
it
was
quite
solid
for
the
style
the
aroma
was
rather
bright
and
summer
like
with
a
light
grain
and
herb
like
fruit
note
in
the
nose
a
touch
of
clove
and
banana
highlighted
this
one
and
really
did
a
nice
job
at
bringing
the
whole
thing
together
the
flavor
was
much
of
the
same
surprisingly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
maybe
honey
or
light
caramel
hints
of
apple
and
light
fresh
hay
the
banana
coming
though
nicely
on
the
finish
with
a
quick
clean
and
very
crisp
cutoff
in
the
overall
taste
o
this
beer
shows
that
you
can
have
great
flavor
with
low
alcohol
i
wish
i
had
this
in
the
summer
revised
with
nov
2014
sample
on
tap
o
good
one
for
drinking
on
the
back
porch
in
the
afternoon
not
incredibly
overwhelmed
by
it
but
i
would
have
it
again
havent
really
had
many
of
this
style
before
but
if
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
styleas
seems
to
be
the
case
judging
from
the
consenus
of
the
reviews
it
struck
me
as
a
laidback
tasty
summer
beer
it
is
only
because
i
have
drank
plenty
of
kolsch
in
cologne
that
i
maintain
a
snobby
line
here
otherwise
this
is
the
second
best
kolsch
i
have
so
far
found
brewed
in
america
3
5
o
overall
would
definitely
have
this
again
very
refreshing
o
not
sure
where
that
white
winegrape
flavor
came
from
but
it
really
ruined
the
beer
o
overall
not
bad
not
great
this
is
a
style
that
ive
begun
exploring
recently
and
this
one
is
okay
bear
in
mind
that
i
sat
on
this
one
for
a
while
so
possibly
it
is
past
its
prime
overall
not
particularly
germanic
in
style
but
very
approachable
a
great
summer
crossover
beer
d
this
beer
goes
to
show
that
simple
can
often
be
incredibly
flavorful
perfect
for
summer
drinking
o
solid
example
of
a
kolsch
perfectly
sessionable
on
a
hot
day
o
not
a
bad
beer
definately
appreciate
the
oportunity
to
try
a
beer
i
cant
get
around
here
honestly
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
anticipated
thanks
again
for
the
opportunity
jason
overall
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
love
a
good
kolsch
and
this
is
one
i
wanted
to
love
sadly
it
just
isnt
very
good
overall
impression
a
great
brew
i
gotta
get
some
more
of
this
pronto
o
a
very
sessionable
kolsch
great
flavor
nice
and
light
t
carbonates
with
a
touch
of
tart
lager
some
maltyness
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
caramel
kind
of
lacking
in
flavor
not
bad
not
great
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beers
and
mother
earth
makes
a
great
one
it
helps
that
they
are
just
down
the
road
from
me
like
a
good
hef
the
yeast
leaves
behind
a
fruity
tangy
taste
although
a
kolsch
isnt
near
as
yeasty
the
sweetness
is
balanced
by
a
nice
hop
bitterness
hardly
a
hoppy
beer
but
just
enough
to
bite
the
side
of
your
tounge
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
in
fact
im
gonna
have
one
now
o
right
near
the
top
of
the
list
of
kolschs
definite
recomendation
for
a
sessionable
beer
high
on
flavor
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
wheat
slight
grain
and
water
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
but
that
is
being
nice
this
one
was
pretty
weak
in
just
about
all
aspects
if
im
honest
could
definitely
be
a
lot
more
robust
it
would
make
a
good
summer
brew
or
gateway
beer
but
that
is
about
it
tasted
on
tap
at
louellas
bbq
place
in
asheville
nc
worth
a
visit
if
youre
hungry
and
want
to
try
a
decent
selection
of
beers
on
tap
drinks
quite
well
i
could
see
sixers
of
this
going
down
very
easily
on
a
hot
summer
day
too
bad
its
not
available
in
my
area
a
nice
clean
simple
kolsch
with
a
nice
little
hop
bite
well
done
this
brewery
is
local
to
me
and
i
have
been
wanting
to
sample
their
wares
for
a
while
now
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
is
impressive
at
first
but
doesnt
stick
around
smells
of
butter
and
biscuits
with
a
hint
of
grass
the
flavor
is
bright
and
pungent
lots
of
malt
up
front
and
aftertaste
is
floral
and
herbal
with
a
great
hop
tingle
mouthfeel
is
robust
and
slightly
filmy
drinkability
is
great
with
a
low
alcohol
content
and
great
wellbalanced
taste
however
at
9
99
a
six
pack
ill
save
this
one
for
special
occassions
it
pours

i
picked
the
perfect
beer
light
in
taste
with
a
slight
sweet
hop
spice
perfectly
placed
at
the
end
each
sip
inoffensive
in
every
way
possible
kinder
than
a
michelob
ultra
but
made
to
be
enjoyed
rather
than
profited
from
its
impossible
to
hide
potential
flaws
in
lighter
beer
styles
thankfully
mother
earth
did
not
have
to
worry
about
thisno
flaws
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
light
clean
crisp
and
easy
drinking
it
poured

with
a
thin

of

this
beer
has
a
light
body
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
is
a
very
approachable
beer
and
is
a
great
session
beer
for
a
hot
day
good

mouthfeel

somewhat
characteristic
of

consistency
is
perhaps
a

heavier
than
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
with
a
lively
effervescence
all
and
all
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
domestic
kolsch

not
as
delicate
as
some
of
its
german
cousins
but
very
approachable
and
sessionable
lightmedium
body
with
crisp

a
bit
heavier
than
most
kolsches
overall
its
decent
much
more
overt
flavor
than
a
typical
kolsch
which
may
be
a
positive
or
a
negative
depending

you
expect
from
your
kolsch

taste
quite
bitter
with
a
little
orange
peel
thrown
in
there
for
kicks
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
quite
thin
drinkability
is
average
not
a
terrible
beer
just
not
up
to
mother
earths
norm
drinkability
a
fairly
likable
kölsch
good
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
but
suits
me
just
fine
during
a
coolish
midafternoon
in
autumn
paired
well
enough
with
a
grilled
shrimp
po
boy
d
several
of
my
noncraft
drinking
friends
loved
this
beer
said
it
reminded
them
of
gi
urban
wheat
uhhh
not
sure
about
that
but
this
appears
to
be
a
great
crossover
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
another
one
of
these
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
very
refreshing
very
drinkable
as
well
totally
acceptable
kölsch
here
that
while
maybe
not
the
most
full
flavored
version
of
the
style
that
ive
had
still
stayed
mostly
tasty
and
quaffable
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
glass
of
this
on
a
hot
day
sparkling
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
lumpy
purewhite
head
on
top
light
fresh
pale
malt
aroma
with
soft
grassy
hops
and
a
subtle
apple
and
lemon
frutiness
lightly
sweet
cereal
grain
flavor
finishing
with
a
crisp
bitterness
the
hops
are
subtle
and
have
an
earthy
leafiness
to
them
light
crisp
extremely
drinkable
perfect
for
hot
nc
days
its
very
simple
but
well
made
i
like
what
these
guys
are
doing
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
little
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
pleasant
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
crisp
the
little
bitterness
at
the
end
is
good
drinkability
is
fine
would
be
a
decent
enough
session
beer
i
rated
the
drinkability
higher
as
it
does
go
down
smooth
and
i
could
see
drinking
these
all
night
a
good
clean
orangish
body
that
is
wellcarbd
w
sticking
head
on
top
of
a
strong
peppery
almost
sour
fruit
like
aroma
as
well
as
minor
sweet
malts
lightbodied
and
slightly
smooth
and
creamy
w
some
minor
fruit
sweetness
like
grape
can
candy
apple
as
well
as
sour
notes
mixed
w
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
for
balance
and
hop
bitterness
and
carbonation
lead
to
a
sharp
spicey
backbite
a
fairly
good
and
sessionable
kolsch
that
is
decent
rep
of
this
style
d
another
nice
session
with
mother
earth
solid
drinkable
beers
if
you
were
to
ask
my
opinion
the
taste
is
very
much
like
the
nose
bready
and
toasty
grains
and
floral
hops
like
the
nose
there
is
also
a
slightly
sweet
flavor
more
honey
than
fruit
lightmedium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
impressive
beer
from
an
impressive
new
brewery
looking
forward
to
watching
mother
earth
brewing
grow
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
kolsch
lots
of
nice
flavors
with
an
easy
drinking
body
very
refreshing
this
is
one
for
the
lakes
thanks
jason
for
this
new
beer
this
is
surprisingly
hoppy
for
a
kolsch
its
full
of
dull
grapefruit
and
herbal
spice
the
typical
subtle
fruit
flavors
are
gone
for
a
dark
bread
crust
malt
flavor
the
beer
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
doesnt
taste
like
a
kolsch
at
all
its
good
but
dont
expect
anything
traditional
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
as
per
usual
for
the
style
excellent
not
quite
on
par
with
the
coast
offering
i
just
finished
because
of
the
minor
sulphur
presence
but
really
theres
not
much
of
a
limit
as
to
how
much
of
this
i
could
drink
before
getting
tired
of
it
tasty
tasty
beer
overall
a
very
well
done
kolsch
overall
this
was
my
first
experience
drinking
a
mother
earth
brew
and
i
will
be
drinking
more
in
the
future
i
actually
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
their
india
pale
ale
this
afternoon
and
cant
wait
to
try
it
endless
river
seems
like
a
great
beer
for
springsummer
especially
for
those
such
as
myself
who
dont
really
care
for
wheat
beers
i
hope
bas
in
nc
will
support
this
brewery
the
body
is
crisp
and
bubbly
refreshing
feel
great
lemony
flavor
right
away
silky
buttery
feel
some
bready
biscuit
aftertaste
definite
noble
hops
present
as
well
i
really
like
this
beer
this
style
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
gotos
and
this
one
is
a
great
example
single
from
sams
durham
days
like
today
here
in
carolina
are
days
to
drink
a
good
kolschwarm
and
lazy
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glassa
light
pale
yellow
with
a
thinner
but
well
defined
white

spritzy

hint
of
vanilla

are
again
lightly
toasty
with
a

notea
light
quenching
tartness
in
the
finish
a
nice
kolsch
herenot
just
something
to
throw
back
by
any
meansnice
flavor
md
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
bordering
on
high
excellent
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
kolsch
in
my
opinion
and
i
would
put
it
up
against
any
domestic
kolsch
out
there
a
beer
like
this
gives
me
high
hops
for
mother
earth
moving
forward
the
flavor
is
definitely
beer
though
the
dry
sweetness
from
the
aroma
isnt
as
apparent
as
i
am
more
aware
of
the
soft
earthy
hop
character
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
from
the
malt
and
yeast
the
texture
is
quite
smooth
but
at
the
same
time
pleasantly
tingly
with
its
soft
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
mild
without
being
watery
making
it
a
light
and
enjoyable
selection
the
drink
is
lightbodied
softly
carbonated
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
good
beer
classy
labeling
and
such
but
a
bit
expensive
at
over
12
bucks
a
sixer
somewhat
bland
flavor
even
for
a
kölsch
and
even
as
endless
river
warms
saltine
crackers
and
pilsner
malt
lay
down
a
light
bready
foundation
upon
which
a
sharp
grassy
hop
bitterness
is
built
soapytasting
on
the
way
back
up
carbonation
is
big
and
bubbly
contrasting
nicely
against
the
light
body
and
adds
a
snappy
zesty
almost
drying
bite
to
the
finish
an
easydrinking
kölsch
for
sure
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
out
of
mother
earth
considering
the
steep
price
tag
and
the
precedent
set
by
their
sisters
of
the
moon
ipa
and
bingo
a
classic
eastcoast
kolsch
right
now
im
hard
pressed
to
think
of
one
ive
enjoyed
much
more
than
endless

ontap
at
flying
saucer
raleigh
on
nov

served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
and
reviewed
from
notes
served
a
crisp
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
and
earthy
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
same
holding
pretty
true
to
the
style
the
beer
is
quite
light
crisp
smooth
and
refreshing
this
one
was
quite
enjoyable
one
id
love
to
enjoy
more
of
especially
in
the
warmer
months
i
will
start
by
saying
that
this
is
generally
not
my
style
of
beer
but
i
bought
a
mixer
of
all
their
beers
also
this
should
probably
be
reviewed
during
the
summer
months
after
a
long
hot
day
outside
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
refreshing
and
light
beautiful
gold
color
with
a
nice
head
on
top
everything
tasted
just
right
i
may
have
this
as
my
go
to
summer
beer
when
they
put
it
on
tap
for
home
kegs
if
i
dont
feel
like
going
to
total
wine
and
more
to
buy
gaffel
kölsch
then
this
what
i
buy
very
good
kölschstyle
brew
and
its
local
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
light
beer
made
for
the
brutal
arizona
summers
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
a
very
good
kolsch
style
beer
would
recommend
trying
sunbru
feels
alright
somewhat
thin
mild
carb
overall
not
much
to
talk
about
here
but
a
refreshing
quencher
for
the
hot
days
in
arizona
no
doubt
golden
hay
colored
with
a
little
haze
topped
with
a
head
which
retains
decently
leaving
spotty
lace
around
the
walls
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
grainy
hay
a
kiss
of
fruit
simple
and
straightforward
the
flavor
is
as
well
though
it
meets
the
standard
for
a
kolsch
its
crisp
and
clean
with
hay
and
a
snap
of
hops
done
in
a
way
where
its
flavorful
as
well
its
light
bodied
and
very
refreshing
pushing
the
beer
on
course
as
a
kolschstyled
beer
that
i
would
recommended
its
a
pretty
decent
kolsch
and
an
easy
drinker
poured
a
nice
clear
gold
with
a
thin
ring
of
nice
white
head
beautiful
german
lager
appearance
scents
of
german
yeast
some
hoppy
notes
and
crystal
malt
what
i
expect
in
a
kolsch
flavor
is
malty
sweet
good
crystal
malt
sweetness
and
bready
flavors
this
is
balanced
with
a
nice
german
hop
presence
which
keeps
it
from
being
too
sweet
and
bready
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
nice
and
refreshing
this
is
a
good
kolsch
worth
drinking
its
one
of
the
better
four
peaks
offerings
behind
their
stout
and
ipa
an
alright
tasting
lighter
beer
id
like
to
have
a
cooler
full
of
these
on
a
really
hot
summers
day
whether
i
being
golfing
fishing
or
just
kickin
back
d
a
surprisingly
nice
kolsch
for
an
american
brewery
the
malt
character
is
rich
and
balances
well
on
the
finish
easily
in
my
top
three
favorites
of
the
four
peaks
brews
the
sunbru
is
great
from
the
tap
or
a
can
it
has
a
lighter
yellow
appearance
and
and
the
flavor
this
beer
packs
is
tough
to
rival
the
sharp
citrus
flavor
along
with
the
light
feel
of
this
beer
make
it
tough
kolsch
to
rival
clarity
is
fine
pale
golden
color
smells
of
fermented
pears
freshbaked
crackers
and
light
floral

malt
palate
is
near
immaculate
and
intensely
smooth
mild
bite
of
apple
within
but
the
dry
graininess
is
the
real
show
here
balance
from
the
hops
with
a
pinch
of
flavor
in
the
finish
long
dry
finish
the
aftertaste
is
very
clean
which
makes
this
beer
extremely
refreshing
the
taste

ask
for
another
sip
nailed
it
for
the
style
and
nailed
it
for
being
so
damn
drinkable
update

from
the
12
oz
can
it
never
occurred
to
me
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
kölsch
since
its
missing
anything
like
perfumey
aromas
and
hops
aroma
of
damp
grain
and
a
slight
doughy
taste
totally
inoffensive
light
lager
however
the

the
crack
glug
was
a
welcome
relief
from
all
of
the
bottles
that
i
was
opening
at
my
aunt
uncles
place
last
week
i
had
a
fizzy
finger
of
bonewhite
head
that
exited
like
the
place
was
on
fire
and
it
was
a
cool
evening
finally
following
some
muchneeded
rain
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
greg
koch
beer
for
sure
nose
had
a
lemon
zestycitrus
quality
and
i
was
ready
to
drink
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
between
the
biscuit
malt
and
the
lemon
zest
i
could
have
closed
my
eyes
and
envisioned
biting
into
a
lemon
tart
i
am
not
big
on
sweets
as
a
general
rule
and
i
usually
eschew
chocolate
but
when
a
lemon
or
cherry
tart
is
offered
up
i
am
the
first
in
line
this
beer
really
played
its
strengths
to
my
weaknesses
finish
was
more
lemony
than
malty
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
it
was
sour
or
in
any
way
overbearing
this
would
be
an
excellent
candidate
for
the
cooler
for
mowing
the
lawn
or
heading
for
the
beach
and
i
will
make
a
note
of
it
yum
good
drinkable
beer
something
to
enjoy
with
friends
on
a
night
out
o
not
as
lively
and
bright
as
a
kolsch
should
be
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
clean
but
not
quite
up
to
snuff

light
mouthfeel

its
a
light
drinking
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
overall
probably
a
good
summertime
beer
seems
this
is
a
tough
style
to
emulate
here
in
the
states
but
i
would
drink
this
again
on
a
hot
day
d
a
mediocre
example
of
a
kölsch
i
dont
see
myself
revisiting
this
brew
pours
a
very
clean
light
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
is
quite
bubbly
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
plain
with
just
a
bit
of
grain
plain
but
fairly
average
for
a
kolsch
taste
is
pretty
gross
and
somewhat
teeth
this
goes
along
with
a
bit
of
light
grain
feel
is
quite
light
and
semioffensive
drinkability
is
poor
and
a
few
ounces
was
quite
enough
for
me
d
this
beer
would
be
a
good
one
to
sit
with
some
friends
and
kickback
on
a
hot
day
i
can
almost
tell
that
the
flavor
would
change
dramatically
with
the
outside
temperature
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
these
go
down
quickly
i
shared
a
12
pack
with
some
friends
i
would
purchase
again
for
sure
beer
is
light
and
has
a
grainy
edge
to
it
mildly
sweet
pilsen
malt
up
front
its
medium
to
light
in
body
and
has
a
wet
finish
well
congratulations
its
a
kolsch
id
have
it
again
the
taste
was
faint
i
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
was
a
bar
above
flavorless
there
were
a
few
lemony
hops
and
a
mellow
herbalness
not
to
mention
it
ended
slightly
bitter
but
i
think
most
of
what
i
tasted
was
due
in
large
part
to
the
aroma
as
i
had
the
glass
to
my
mouth
aka
under
my
nose
it
went
past
thin
into
watery
a
place
i
thought
id
never
toss
a
microbrew
and
i
was
vaguely
disappointed
ive
come
to
expect
better
things
from
craft
beers
but
this
one
might
be
considered
a
novice
beer
for
someone
starting
to
get
into
microbrews
which
was
me
a
month
ago
and
i
hate
to
say
it
but
a
month
ago
i
probably
would
have
gladly
drank
this
beer
without
a
second
thought
im
just
glad
i
jumped
in
head
first
and
never
looked
back
because
i
will
not
be
picking
this
one
up
again
sorry
four
peaks
ill
stick
with
your
darker
beers
drinkability
is
great
for
a
nice
flavored
clean
kolsch
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
scottsdale
location
brewed
in
tempe
fresh
smell
light
yellow
and
very
lacey
a
mild
bitterness
hits
the
mark
as
they
mostly
dobatting
average
rather
than
home
run
hitters
showing
skill
average
mouthfeel
a
good
start
and
nicely
drinkable
at
lunchtime
d
i
was
in
arizona
and
granted
it
was
only
spring
but
it
was
hot
to
me
and
this
was
a
perfect
beer
session
defined
herbal
component
is
quite
pronounced
finish
is
dry
crisp
on
tap
at
nelloss
in
mesa
color
is
a
pale
yellow
with
a
very
slight
head
aroma
was
very
light
like
youd
expect
for
a
summer
beer
some
malt
and
maybe
a
bit
of
spice
tasted
lightly
of
malt
bread
and
some
bitter
hops
leaving
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
fairly
drinkable
but
not
as
intense
as
some
other
kolsch
beers
ive
had
i
miss
rio
salados
drank
easy
but
just
a
run
of
the
mill
kolsch
d
easy
drinking
and
smooth
at
5abv
not
much
flavor
or
body
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
would
unlikely
seek
this
out
again
in
the
future
as
for
drinkability
in
the
arizona
summer
this
is
great
a
great
lawnmower
beer
for
when
it
is
110
outside
this
is
refreshing
and
light
this
would
also
be
a
great
starter
beer
for
someone
trying
to
get
into
microbrews
i
wouldnt
travel
to
get
it
but
if
someone
handed
me
a
glass
i
would
drink
it
a
good
starter
beer
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
just
an
slightly
different
version
of
their
fools
gold
which
is
also
an
easy
to
drink
starter
beer
sunbru
is
good
for
the
non
microbrew
drinkers
as
an
introduction
to
real
beer
light
strawgold
color
almost
no
hops
some
hop
bitterness
but
appropriate
for
the
style
a
little
bit
more
than
a
pilsner
but
not
overpowering
is
a
great
lawn
mower
beer
for
the
arizona
heat
nice
name
this
beer
sits
a
pale
straw
color
in
my
glass
it
is
topped
by
a
wispy
pale
colored
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
spicy
with
hops
and
it
has
a
grainy
note
to
it
as
well
as
a
bit
of
soft
fruitiness
this
beer
as
expected
is
quite
light
on
the
palate
and
it
quickly
disappears
after
one
takes
a
swallow
the
taste
is
lightly
spicy
with
a
nice
mellow
herbal
taste
this
beer
finishes
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
this
is
certainly
a
well
made
light
beer
just
not
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
this
beer
is
lightly
balanced
between
hop
flavor
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
malt
with
some
fruity
notes
very
nice
clean
refreshing
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
really
good
local
pbr
the
crack
was
as
loud
as
a
cannon
and
the
can
was
as
full
as
the
trenches
in
early1915
the
inverted
glug
was
precise
in
its
deployment
and
quickly
netted
me
two
fingers
of
foamy
fizzy
bonewhite
head
that
began
to
collapse
under
the
exertion
leaving
belgian
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
strawyellow
srm

a
preciseness
measured
by
the
brewery
as
yellow
as
the
cowards
who
retreated
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
and
with
neplus
quality
clarity
allowing
me
to
peer
into
a
grim
future
nose
was
what
i
tend
to
think
of
with
regard
to
the
style
slightly
honeylike
slightly
grassy
if
we
still
rated
on
smell
i
would
characterize
this
as
perfect
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
the
taste
was
grassy
and
honeylike
sort
of
a
gateway
between
a
light
lager
and
a
german
pilsner
i
have
to
disagree
with
them
as
to
a
sweet
finish
because
i
would
characterize
it
as
dry
the
can
mentions
o
g

p
and
ibu

so
i
think
that
an
argument
can
be
made
for
my
point
of
view
a
very
nice
light
drinking
beer
on
a
summers
day
o
great
brew
well
done
kolsch
got
this
one
in
asheville
drank
in
chicago
il
with
some
deep
dish
pizza
great
combo
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
straw
gold
coloring
with
a
fluffy
tall
clingy
white
head
steady
carbonation
action
throughout
the
body
too
nose
of
toasted
grains
subtle
floral
notes
and
hints
of
berry
esthers
flavors
are
tangy
forward
with
buttered
toast
notes
and
a
subtle
hops
bitterness
smooth
and
light
with
a
frothy
effervesced
finish
tangy
grainy
aftertaste
not
bad
a
very
easy
to
drink
brew
that
would
be
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
i
am
just
fine
drinking
it
after
a
long
day
to
decompress
good
example
of
the
style
o
does
not
make
the
earth
shift
on
its
axis
but
is
easy
to
drink
and
satisfying
o
very
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
and
tasty
i
could
see
myself
picking
this
up
a
lot
more
frequently
once
the
weather
gets
warms
great
beer
for
when
i
am
out
on
the
porch
manning
the
grill
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
it
makes
for
a
good
beer
to
drink
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
taste
follows
pretty
closely
its
fairly
honey
sweet
full
of
grain
and
wheat
and
a
very
small
bitterness
at
the
backend
this
is
a
pretty
straightforward
beer
here
a
bit
surprised
at
the
lack
of
citrus
character
nothing
complicated
but
it
goes
down
quite
easily
would
probably
make
a
great
summer
beer

overall
a
tasty
easy
drinking
kolsch
thin
head
that
doesnt
last
long
on
a
near
crystal
clear
bright
golden
body
the
aroma
is
very
light
with
barely
perceptable
pale
malts
sweet
corn
and
honey
flavor
has
a
nice
amount
of
honey
flavor
with
barely
wheat
and
herbal
flavors
nice
body
for
the
style
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
certainly
drinkable
with
nice
degree
of
sweetness
and
flavor
for
a
style
that
can
be
fairly
bland
overall
i
love
kolsch
but
is
one
isnt
as
well
crafted
and
flavorful
as
some
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
kolsch
fans
can
do
better
o
quite
a
nice
beer
its
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
brought
the
bottle
back
from
a
trip
out
to
north
carolina
and
was
not
disappointed
i
have
just
started
getting
into
the
kolsh
beers
and
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
one
for
a
hot
summer
kansas
afternoon
this
is
a
very
light
easy
to
drink
refreshing
beer
it
doesnt
have
much
flavor
but
its
to
style
and
ultimately
enjoyable
o
good
light
kolsch
im
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
but
enjoyable
i
found
it
less
sessionable
than
others
though
simply
because
the
aftertaste
hung
around
so
long
overall
a
very
good
beer
from
a
style
that
should
be
fairly
mild
and
bland
this
is
something
you
could
drink
a
ton
of
either
by
itself
or
with
food
o
i
think
the
name
of
this
beer
might
have
captured
it
its
a
gateway
kolsch
i
think
this
might
be
a
good
one
for
me
to
try
to
get
into
the
style
it
is
certainly
not
my
favorite
beer
ive
ever
had
and
i
doubt
this
will
be
the
favorite
of
this
style
but
its
something
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
and
not
ask
too
many
questions
about
it
its
not
super
complex
but
its
extremely
drinkable
and
definitely
quite
tasty
i
definitely
like
this
beer
it
would
make
a
great
fishin
beer
does
it
come
in
cans
smells
a
little
like
a
white
wine
maybe
some
grapes
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
very
thin
head
that
dissapates
quickly
tastes
like
a
bubbly
wine
very
heavy
taste
on
the
grapes
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
fairly
dry
but
very
drinkable
i
drank
the
entire
bomber
without
an
issue
i
would
say
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
kill
the
pallet
this
would
be
good
for
a
wine
drinker
as
a
craft
option
o
overall
this
is
a
style
i
havent
explored
much
but
this
was
way
different
than
i
had
expected
the
nose
was
the
highlight
and
i
wish
that
the
rest
of
the
beer
lived
up
to
that
promise
but
allinall
a
decent
beer
and
one
that
im
glad
i
finally
opened
thanks

my

i
would
rather

only
because
it

the

the

glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
a
crisp

kolsch
with
some
nice

keep
it

if
i
didnt

this
again
overall
a
solid
kolsch
but
unremarkable
overall
it
might
be
a
good
beer
but
if
it
is
the
style
doesnt
work
for
me
it
was
a
hot
day
and
i
still
didnt
care
for
it
tastes
only
slightly
different
than
a
run
of
the

macro
only
with
more
character
not
something
i
want
again
o
this
is
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
but
is
not
anything
special
i
would
have
preferred
if
this
beer
had
a
little
less
sweetness
and
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
o
this
beer
has
interesting
flavors
of
grapes
but
seemed
a
little
sweet
for
the
style
and
could
use
more
hop
bitterness
taste
slightly
tartcitrus
type
flavor
with
a
sweetness
following
up

this

my
first

the
head
has

an

is
perpetuated
by

bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
tart
czech

nose
a
bit
of
green

and
some
unripe
banana
peel
a
pretty
surprising
mouthfeel
given
the
appearance
and
the
bouquet
one
would
expect
something
lighter

crisper
the
mouthfeel
is
full

a

thick
nearing

smooth
on
the
finish
really
nice
balance
in
the

o
fff
is
my
one
of
my
23
favorite
breweries
and
i
consider
them
the
worlds
best
without
question
while
im
not
a
kolsch
fan
at
all
it
is
a
decent
style
for
the
summer
an
ale
with
lager
like
characteristics
hmm
idk
while
calumet
queen
wasnt
horrible
i
cant
say
its
worthy
of
being
alpha
kings
girl
friend
or
anything
close
to
having
a
relationship
for
that
matter
you
are
talking
big
time
class
in
alpha
and
just
so
so
with
calumet
it
was
cool
to
get
a
not
always
released
bottle
from
fff
and
this
experience
will
not
stop
the
fact
that
ill
buy
anything
fff
if
i
see
it
but
this
wasnt
good
enough
for
me
to
want
again
but
then
again
i
dont
think
its
3
floyds
i
think
its
just
the
style
i
mean
in
terms
of
this
german
style
they
hit
it
out
of
the
park
but
the
kolsch
ball
park
isnt
all
that
big
imo
worth
a
try
but
nothing
to
get
your
hopes
up
on
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
german
styles
and
3f
did
well
with
it
but
this
just
shows
how
hard
it
is
to
make
a
really
good
kolsch
but
hey
thats
just
my
tastebuds
i
give
them
credit
for
doing
it
well
but
how
well
can
one
do
a
kolsch
i
doubt
any
better
than
calumet
it
shows
how
good
fff
are
but
in
turn
shows
me
how
bad
the
kolsch
style
is
o
fff
amazes
me
around
every
turn
and
for
them
to
turn
out
a
hit
from
a
style
that
in
lesser
hands
tend
to
be
bland
speaks
volumes
as
to
their
talents
now
if
they
could
only
do
something
about
their
poor
attitude
im
not
sure
how
three
floyds
does
it
but
theyve
managed
to
make
yet
another
easy
drinking
relatively
light
lager
nothing
aggressive
or
insane
this
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
in
the
dead
heat
of
summer
or
ever
really
its
good
this
is
a
really
nice
lighter
offering
that
is
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
if
i
had
one
complaint
it
would
be
the
cereal
grains
at
points
they
were
intense
enough
that
it
came
close
to
eating
corn
flakes
but
on
the
whole
it
was
balanced
and
well
put
together
if
you
like
kolschs
youll
like
this
onot
a
style
im
a
fan
off
easily
the
worst
fff
beer
ive
had
still
decent
would
be
a
nice
summer
drinker
clearish
strawyellow
pour
with
a
cap
of
foamy
white
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
looked
kolschy
thin
aroma
toasted
grains
light
malt
sweetness
grassy
hops
smelled
kolshy
taste
you
guessed
it
kolschy
toasted
grains
light
biscuit
malt
and
honey
sweetness
light
notes
of
citrus
and
grass
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
pretty
crisp
and
lightbodied
and
good
overall
for
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
but
noting
that
special
i
was
a
bit
dissapointed
would
not
buy
again
o
chalk
up
another
satisfying
release
to
three
floyds
lots
of
flavor
for
a
seemingly
limited
style
id
enjoy
this
as
a
yearround
release
especially
since
nobody
seems
to
be
able
to
put
out
a
nice
flavorful
lager
o
sweet
citrus
and
light
didnt
seem
fully
like
a
kolsch
instead
it
seemed
more
like
a
pilsner
still
its
a
solid
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
pours
a
glimmering
gold
with
a
two
finger
bright
white
head
light
pale
malt
grass
and
flora
accents
of
apple
and
pear
on
the
nose
opens
with
grassy
hops
joined
by
apple
peel
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
a
touch
of
honey
toasted
grain
and
some
light
citric
notes
finishes
fairly
dry
and
crisp
light
body
with
bubbly
carbonation
that
tickles
the
inside
of
the
mouth
overall
a
very
solid
kolsch
o
refreshing
drinkable
but
not
incredibly
memorable
would
drink
again
at
the
right
price
o
pretty
solid
flavor
profile
for
a
kolsch
and
it
had
a
little
more
hop
bite
than
normal
which
is
on
par
with
fff
its
a
little
too
cold
in
chicago
now
for
this
guy
but
on
a
hat
summer
day
this
would
be
great
seasonal
summer
six
packs
would
be
good
o
not
the
most
flavorful
kolsch
ive
had
but
it
does
the
job
went
down
smooth
but
really
not
much
to
write
home
about
kolsch
is
a
style
that
i
dont
always
crave
and
when
i
do
there
are
certainly
better
ones
out
there
o
tastes
like
a
kölsch
a
well
made
kölsch
but
its
not
exactly
the
most
exciting
of
beer
styles
that
said
i
do
wish
fff
would
have
put
this
into
distribution
at
the
beginning
of
summer
instead
of
the
beginning
of
fall
but
i
guess
thats
fff
for
you
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
yellow
color
very
nice
looking
brew
with
a
soapy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
grainy
and
has
some
sweet
corn
aromas
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
its
clean
and
has
some
sweet
grains
and
cornlike
flavors
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
quite
good
for
the
style
i
found
it
to
be
really
impressive
and
i
wouldnt
probably
drink
it
again
d
not
as
musty
or
grapey
as
some
german
examples
ive
tried
but
still
pretty
authentic
as
most
german
offerings
are
from
3
floyds
if
you
like
kölsch
youll
like
this
as
its
a
good
american
take
on
the
style
jason
and
i
finished
the
bomber
in
roughly
10
minutes
so
its
definitely
a
lawnmower
sort
of
beer
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
and
had
to
review
the
style
guidelines
before
trying
this
beer
but
it
seems
to
match
the
description
nearly
perfectly
i
never
thought
i
would
say
this
about
a
fff
beer
but
i
would
like
to
taste
and
smell
just
a
bit
more
hop
character
other
than
that
i
cant
find
anything
to
detract
fff
stayed
true
to
the
style
here
and
made
a
nice
traditional
kolsch
that
said
it
might
be
fun
to
see
what
this
brewer
could
do
if
they
decided
to
go
crazy
with
this
style
o
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
very
crisp
and
refreshing
drank
the
bomber
by
myself
pretty
easily
o
nice
well
balanced
full
flavored
kolsch
from
fff
definitely
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
that
you
could
drink
throughout
the
summer
three
floyds
continues
to
demonstrate
that
they
are
much
more
than
dark
lords
and
dreadnaughts
by
branching
into
and
largely
succeeding
outside
of
their
comfort
zones
with
gorch
fock
and
calumet
queen
but
with
its
strong
malt
presence
firm
malthop
balance
and
minerally
undertones
im
more
comfortable
with
this
beer
as
a
dortmunder
exportstyle
lager
despite
its
yeast
or
temperature
in
brewing
technique
poured
into
3
floyds
pint
glass
appearance
is
clear
gold
with
a
small
dense
layer
of
white
head
tons
of
lacing
in
this
one
aroma
features
significant
dry
grainy
notes
paired
with
lemon
zest
notes
of
wheat
come
in
next
with
a
touch
of
lemon
on
the
end
taste
is
malty
up
frot
with
dry
bready
grainy
notes
just
like
the
nose
lemon
and
citrus
are
heavy
in
the
mid
palate
with
a
zesty
finish
lots
of
flavor
packed
into
this
with
a
nice
and
refreshing
balance
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
high
carbonation
an
light
body
overall
solid
take
on
the
style
not
bad
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
im
not
extremely
familiar
with
the
kolsch
style
quite
yet
but
this
one
is
solid
it
feels
and
tastes
like
quality
its
simple
and
light
but
refreshing
and
smooth
i
prefer
their
other
two
lagers
i
have
tried
jinx
and
gorch
fock
but
this
isnt
far
off
overall
a
nice
kolsch
usually
not
a
very
exciting
style
but
this
one
is
full
flavored
and
creamy
providing
both
good
tasting
and
a
refreshing
brew
this
pours
a
cloudy
and
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
white
lacing
u
smells
of
a
faded
kolsch
pale
malt
light
spice
and
light
funk
strange
from
fff
the
taste
too
of
light
almost
pilsner
esque
malts
and
light
citrus
it
sounds
alright
but
for
this
one
its
weak
it
drinks
light
in
body
and
doesnt
feature
all
that
much
flavor
i
consider
it
weak
for
the
style
its
ok
just
ok
i
expect
better
from
the
guys
who
make
a
great
dortmunder
lager
in
jinx
proof
clean
flavor
simple
combo
of
apple
grape
and
husky
graininess
light
to
medium
feel
with
seemingly
lower
carbonation
very
light
malt
flavor
sort
of
hohum
finishes
somewhat
dry
but
not
as
crisp
as
better
examples
of
the
style
it
was
ok
glad
i
tried
it
and
easily
finished
it
not
sure
if
it
would
hold
the
attention
of
beer
geeks
for
long
but
it
appeals
to
the
broader
customer
base
at
the
brewpub
overall
i
tend
to
enjoy
a
good
kolsch
on
a
hot
day
and
while
this
certainly
meets
the
requirement
for
a
refreshing
drink
it
doesnt
wow
me
id
actually
prefer
a
krankshaft
kolsch
by
metropolitan
brewing
but
this
is
certainly
worth
trying
and
enjoyable
in
its
own
right
pretty
light
in
flavor
overall
easy
to
drink
a
few
o
in
calumet
queen
three
floyds
aimed
to
brew
a
crisp
and
refreshing
lighter
summer
offering
and
hit
the
target
in
addition
i
find
the
vinous
maltiness
enchanting
d
this
is
a
perfect
summertime
drinker
i
would
sip
on
this
while
i
mowed
the
lawn
or
just
having
a
good
conversation
with
friends
good
beer
to
give
to
someone
who
is
not
into
craft
beers
i
had
this
on
tap
at
dld
2009
kolsch
style
doesnt
get
much
respect
but
i
enjoy
its
subtlety
and
ive
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
it
was
served
in
about
a
12oz
plastic
cup
the
beer
was
a
little
murky
bright
orange
color
thin
white
foam
the
smell
is
classic
light
and
malty
a
little
fruity
funk
like
fruh
or
reissdorf
same
with
the
taste
addictive
and
sweet
very
mild
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
i
would
definitely
buy
a
lot
of
this
if
it
was
available
in
bottles
a
great
summer
deck
beer
d
damn
drinkable
and
easily
sessionable
a
good
one
to
have
with
food
or
to
just
kick
back
with
i
had
two
pints
of
this
at
the
pub
but
i
could
have
easily
had
about
six
of
them
very
good
example
of
a
kolsch
i
wish
they
had
this
one
more
often
this
is
a
crisp
bigbodied
and
fullflavored
beer
that
is
also
immensely
refreshing
and
quaffable
d
they
could
bottle
this
as
a
summer
seasonal
and
sell
a
lot
of
it
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
calumet
queen
is
not
one
of
the
beers
responsible
for
three
floydss
much
deserved
reputation
as
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
that
doesnt
mean
however
that
it
isnt
worth
a
purchase
i
had
my
doubts
about
buying
an
entire
growler
but
im
now
glad
that
i
did
it
may
not
be
a
typical
kolsch
and
it
may
not
occupy
the
same
lofty
perch
as
dreadnaught
dark
lord
and
gumballhead
but
its
still
a
delicious
beer
that
will
go
well
with
the
cookout
that
ill
be
heading
for
in
a
few
minutes
had
this
on
tap
this
weekend
at
the
brew
pub
orange
and
turbid
small
head
gone
very
fast
mild
odor
slightly
spicy
some
hops
evident
very
diluted
watery
tasting
beer
like
a
tripel
diluted
18
some
spice
not
much
else
my
least
favorite
3f
so
far
d
the
hops
are
not
that
interesting
and
they
hang
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
overpowering
the
malt
this
is
a
tough
style
to
pull
off
and
im
afraid
they
didnt
do
it
draft
poured
by
nick
floyd
can
this
be
a
3f
thats
not
that
great
well
maybe
the
tap
was
off
because
i
tasted
nothing
that
matched
the
style
description
or
other
reviews
i
got
a
big
offflavor
of
raw
grain
mild
citrus
hop
could
not
make
up
for
it
i
will
have
to
resample
sometime
clear
gold
straw
color
with
a
thin
head
leaves
some
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slightly
grainy
with
a
fairly
strong
herbal
character
a
lot
of
noble
hops
in
there
flavor
begins
crackerlike
the
becomes
herbal
spicy
and
finally
bitter
its
very
heavily
hopped
more
than
id
normally
expect
for
a
kölsch
then
again
this
is
three
floyds
its
not
normal
with
a
crisp
taste
and
light
body
its
quite
refreshing
sampled
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
after
from
the
growler
i
bought
this
beer
was
a
light
gold
color
and
a
little
cloudy
it
had
a
small
white
head
that
left
trace
lace
an
aroma
of
hops
and
slightly
herbalgrainey
a
flavor
of
hops
and
grain
the
finish
and
body
was
light
but
a
touch
astrigent
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
this
stye
but
not
a
bad
beer
a
bit
odd
to
pick
this
time
of
the
year
to
put
in
on
tap
though
pale
golden
and
slightly
hazy
nice
white
head
herbal
aroma
with
a
bit
of
the
new
mown
hay
smell
but
not
strong
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
fairly
spicy
but
not
overwhelming
really
seemed
like
a
beer
truer
to
the
style
than
ive
come
to
expect
from
three
floyds
theyre
not
normal
still
a
good
brew
light
flavor
and
low
abv
make
this
a
solid
beer
for
the
summertime
ive
had
a
good
amount
of
karbach
beers
and
this
is
not
that
good
doesnt
have
a
flavor
when
i
drink
it
the
crack
was
nice
and
loud
so
i
initiated
an
inverted
glug
to
kick
things
off
in
week
1
of
the
2014
nfl
season
i
initially
had
twoplus
fingers
of
puffy
bonewhite
head
but
they
quickly
fell
to
wisps
leaving
loads
of
sticky
lacing
in
their
wake
the
visual
was
unbelievable
the
canstant
flow
of
carbonic
bubbles
looked
like
a
lava
lamp
in
this
strawyellow
srm
2
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
my
favorite
karbach
has
many
more
to
choose
from
that
are
better
overall
an
outstanding
summer
beer
in
houston
texas
by
an
outstanding
brewer
in
houston
texas
o
a
great
beer
for
summer
with
a
refreshing
hop
profile
love
street
is
a
summer
beer
and
it
does
seem
well
tailored
to
fit
the
style
it
is
more
refreshing
than
the
average
beer
but
it
would
be
better
with
a
little
more
carbonation
it
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
karbach
lineup
but
it
does
have
enough
going
for
it
to
make
it
a
worthwhile
choice
for
the
season
c
for
the
style
its
one
of
the
best
ive
had
my
bet
is
it
wont
replace
your
favorite
summer
standby
if
youve
already
got
one
but
if
you
dont
have
one
this
might
be
it
a
solid
brew
and
at
4
7
abv
its
a
great
option
for
a
session
pours
out
a
clear
pale
gold
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
smells
like
burnt
hair
and
boiled
vegetables
weird
buttery
aroma
too
a
touch
of
sulfur
reminds
me
a
lot
of
shiners
old
summer
kolsch
but
way
worse
grainy
sweet
gross
mess
what
the
fuck
is
this
mouthfeel
is
undercarbonated
slick
and
just
gross
i
hate
this
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
good
american
kolsch
this
is
the
worst
kolsch
ive
had
hands
down
overall
a
well
done
kolsch
very
true
to
style
exactly
what
the
beer
needs
to
be
for
a
summer
seasonal
in
houston
tx
i
see
a
viable
alternative
to
sa
summer
pils
for
houston
beer
drinkers
i
will
down
a
lot
of
these
in
the
coming
months
i
do
like
this
pretty
much
exactly
what
the
style
calls
for
so
i
cant
really
take
off
any
points
just
well
made
for
the
style
and
i
will
be
coming
back
often
in
the
texas
heat
i
am
quite
impressed
by
this
brew
a
wonderful
fruity
taste
that
has
a
nice
hops
bite
that
balances
it
out
just
about
perfectly
the
feel
is
beyond
smooth
it
is
so
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
could
swirl
it
inside
my
mouth
forever
i
could
have
like
ten
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
too
bad
i
only
bought
one
will
get
again
o
interesting
kolsch
wondering
the
age
but
other
than
oft
smell
recommended
reissdorf
kolsch
is
a
great
example
of
a
kolsch
the
flavor
is
perfect
and
is
matched
by
the
color
the
beer
was
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
o
quite
refreshing
good
beer
which
shall
be
repeated
final
score
4
09
a
classic
for
a
reason
me
thinks
o
everything
about
this
beer
is
mild
and
thats
a
compliment
light
body
light
aroma
light
flavor
all
in
harmony
an
excellent
session
beer
would
taste
wonderful
on
the
porch
after
the
first
mow
of
the
spring
this
is
a
delightful
kolsch
full
of
flavor
and
with
a
nice
clean
finish
appearancewise
it
looks
like
a
pilsener
but
once
you
place
under
your
nose
you
immediately
realize
its
a
kolsch
and
a
good
one
in
fact
probably
my
favorite
example
of
this
beer
style
taste
palate
the
flavor
matches
the
aroma
but
with
the
light
breadycracker
like
maltiness
up
front
and
the
hops
finishing
up
overall
its
fairly
clean
and
crisp
it
finishes
dry
and
the
palate
is
light
and
refreshing
o
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
this
style
reissdorf
kolsch
is
usually
a
very
good
value
i
am
usually
able
to
find
it
for
3
to
4
for
a
500ml
bottle
o
clean
and
crisp
and
refreshingly
simple

nyc
nice
clean
with
a
full
body
good
taste
really
good
beer
easy
going
down
expensive
mellow
had
it
at
1
32oz
o
easydrinking
and
certainly
good
enough
to
enjoy
but
not
overwhelmingly
good
enough
at
the
price
almost
18
cents
per
ounce
to
justify
drinking
this
much
for
my
tastes
there
are
lots
of
better
german
brews
available
would
be
a
perfect
gateway
beer
to
wean
somebody
off
the
macros
for
a
grainy
brew
its
solid
this
was
my
introduction
to
this
style
and
i
have
to
say
i
rather
like
it
i
would
say
this
particular
beer
is
very
smooth
light
bodied
and
refreshing
like
a
good
lager
beer
but
with
enough
yeasty
and
hoppy
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
a
good
choice
for
hot
weather
when
you
want
some
flavor
too
well
worth
the
sampling
at
4something
for
a
pintplus
bottle
keep
it
up
hennessey
grocery
o
this
is
basically
a
german
pilsner
but
brewed
with
ale
yeast
it
has
many
taste
similarities
to
its
lager
counterpart
but
with
a
more
pronounced
fruity
note
i
suspect
from
the
ale
yeast
i
wish
this
stuff
could
be
found
on
more
tap
lists
probably
the
best
kolsch
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
overall
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
simply
delightful
it
is
a
wonderful
relaxing
drinking
beer
overall
its
a
more
or
less
perfect
example
of
the
style
kolsch
beers
are
obviously
fairly
limited
in
scope
they
do
what
they
do
and
do
it
well
pretty
much
the
perfect
session
beer
overall
a
simple
yet
well
crafted
beer
biscuity
malt
is
prevalent
with
some
fruitiness
to
add
a
bit
of
complexity
really
easy
beer
to
sit
back
relax
and
just
enjoy
taste
is
crisp
and
malty
with
a
light
floral
hop
flavor
everything
comes
together
really
nice
and
smooth
here
a
hell
of
a
drinker
i
couldnt
imagine
something
else
combining
the
refreshing
qualities
with
full
flavor
like
a
good
koelsch
and
this
one
does
it
very
well
not
as
much
yeast
presence
as
i
would
like
to
see
but
other
than
that
it
is
topnotch
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
sunny
day
like
today
round
with
excellent
drinkability
and
not
as
boring
as
some
kolsch
you
can
feel
its
hops
drying
your
palate
forcing
you
to
the
next
sip
if
i
would
judge
it
just
among
kolsch
i
would
have
given
higher
grades
pours
out
a
bright
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
whisp
of
head
trying
to
pull
more
out
of
the
nose
but
its
faint
pale
malts
and
a
touch
of
grain
taste
is
about
the
same
no
off
tastes
whatsoever
but
im
having
a
hard
time
picking
things
out
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
this
is
far
and
away
ahead
of
all
of
the
poor
american
kolsch
attempts
ive
tried
but
id
take
a
sunner
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
o
my
first
kolsch
and
pretty
much
what
i
expected
pretty
plain
simple
and
goes
down
like
water
this
is
what
the
bmcssummer
session
beers
of
the
world
should
be
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
great
pure
white
head
developed
which
was
thick
and
creamy
in
appearance
great
retention
and
good
lacing
appearance
was
a
clear
golden
straw
color
aroma
was
mild
with
notes
of
grain
and
grass
taste
was
clean
and
smooth
with
grain
and
mild
hop
flavors
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
with
a
dry
and
clean
aftertaste
great
beer
o
this
is
the
measuring
stick
by
which
all
other
kolsch
beers
should
be
judged
flawlessly
brewed
this
is
a
classic
kolsch
and
required
drinking
for
anybody
interested
in
the
style
o
good
clean
and
crisp
o
good
representative
of
this
very
mild
style
beer
o
the
very
epitome
of
a
german
session
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
fine
example
of
the
style
nonetheless
m
o
moderately
high
carbonation
initially
dry
somewhat
flat
wsweet
finish
very
well
balanced
i
want
more
to
the
point
a
true
kolsch
drink
it
fast
for
the
flavors
break
down
fairly
quick
as
it
warms
i
would
buy
this
again
o
just
as
i
said
i
bought
this
not
expecting
a
topcaliber
kolsch
but
wondering
how
good
this
could
still
be
after
being
on
the
shelf
for
over
a
year
its
held
up
enough
to
where
its
still
a
competent
if
unimpressive
example
of
the
style
i
plan
on
rereviewing
this
overall
objectively
speaking
the
beer
appears
to
be
true
to
style
subjectively
speaking
this
is
a
beer
with
a
mineral
quality
and
an
astringency
that
i
just
cant
get
behind
reminds
me
of
a
cheap
light
lager
of
course
m
sure
if
i
was
in
germany
and
was
having
a
fresh
bottle
id
be
happier
with
this
beer
a
very
interesting
beer
that
has
you
putting
your
nose
in
the
glass
several
times
things
were
evolving
showing
new
facets
and
developing
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
pours
straw
gold
with
a
tall
head
of
thick
white
foam
that
fell
slowly
leaving
lots
of
lace
behind
and
a
cap
and
ring
exceptional
clarity
and
brilliance
nose
has
a
good
sour
bite
from
the
yeast
up
first
then
a
clean
and
mildly
fruity
smell
apples
and
some
faint
spice
pale
malt
with
a
honey
sweetness
light
grain
earthy
taste
is
perfection
refreshing
with
the
apple
as
it
comes
over
the
palate
fruity
and
sweet
with
plenty
of
smooth
bread
underneath
a
touch
of
floral
and
even
a
little
mint
the
body
is
feather
light
and
smooth
it
s
supple
and
rich
there
is
a
deep
earthy
quality
to
the
malt
that
i
find
spectacular
in
its
straightforward
simplicity
its
dry
overall
and
leaves
with
a
touch
of
pine
and
a
small
bitter
theres
no
lingering
aftertaste
except
for
the
taste
of
minerals
its
superbly
clean
very
refreshing
and
a
stellar
example
of
the
style
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
an
excellent
kolsch
pure
and
true
to
its
heritage
you
cant
help
but
feel
this
is
what
many
domestic
brewers
have
attempted
to
copy
drinkability
is
excellent
malty
grains
in
the
nose
with
a
sort
of
hayness
that
crosses
over
into
the
first
sip
crisp
with
bitter
tealike
astringency
and
and
a
little
peachy
i
feel
like
the
constellations
of
ingredients
are
aligned
in
this
kölsch
perfectly
wish
i
could
find
it

especiall
today
a

the
richness

superb

the

is

example
of

really
awesome
brewing
in
general
o
between
the
bold
fruit
attributes
of
this
kölsch
and
its
softer
bohemian
pilsnerlike
feel
this
kölsch
exemplifies
the
difference
each
brewery
has
for
this
style

i
personally
enjoy
the
more
crisp

versions
a

is
a
very

that
before
you
realize
you
have
consumed

o
not
a

fan
of
kolsch
but
this
was
by
far
the
best
i
have
tried
wouldnt
grab
it
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
purchased
at
the

source
in

more
of
this
multiple

id
love

id
buy
6
of
these
this
is
a
very
easy
to

i
recommend
it
for
the
last
outdoor
occasions
until
you
have
to
put
your
shorts
away
until
next
summer
d
a
very
enjoyable
kölsch

a
bit
of

at

end
but
it
fits
with
the
overall
flavor
refreshing
this
is
a
reminder
of
the
tragedy
of
our
adjunct
beers
and
that
a
brewery
can
make
a
light
low
abv
beer
that
is
flavorful
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
the
kolsch
that
all
others
are
judged
by
i
have
always
liked
this
beer
o
no
sharpness
in
a
good
way
round
sensation
leaves
a
pleasant
and
warm
aftertaste
ive
reviewedrated
a
few
drank
many
in
koln
before
the
internet
arrived
but
cant
say
im
a
big
fan
of
them
even
fresh
in
their
brewhouses
or
beergardens
they
do
however
taste
better
in
bright
warm
sunlight
compared
to
indoors
on
a
wet
and
windy
evening
in
the
uk
overall
great
light
and
easy
to
drink
like
you
would
expect
from
a
kolsch
good
beer
far
more
grainy
flavor
that
i
was
expecting
and
i
love
it
great
lighter
session
beer
not
devoid
of
some
serious
fruity
malty
flavor
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
kolsch
beers
ive
tried
this
is
a
great
beer
the
beauty
of
this
style
and
this
brand
in
particular
is
the
bitter
flavor
is
not
overbearing
the
taste
is
simple
and
yet
delicious
the
smell
is
that
of
the
greatest
hops
it
smells
like
beer
my
dad
used
to
drinkor
the
aroma
i
smelled
when
i
was
around
rohrbachs
brewery
growing
up
ive
tried
other
brands
of
kolsch
including
sunner
and
gaffel
have
to
give
gaffel
another
trybut
so
far
reissdorf
has
this
import
on
lockdown
tastewise
for
me
nothing
else
to
say
really
a
bit
to
watery
not
much
going
on
thin
head
with
lots
of
lacing
on
a
clear
golden
body
aroma
is
light
with
light
malt
and
sweet
corn
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
not
boasting
a
very
strong
flavor
but
consistent
with
the
style
light
bodies
and
high
carbonation
drinkable
and
fuller
than
most
in
the
genre
o
nice
to
try
but
i
am
not
sure
it
was
worth
the
price
the
fruitness
of
it
didnt
win
me
over
i
would
welcome
this
beer
in
the
summer
months
but
beyond
the
unaspiring
qualification
of
thirstquencher
this
beer
offers
little
delicious
treat
yourself
o
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
enjoyable
very
sessionable
beer
brings
back
memories
of
visits
to
the
northern
parts
of

i
once
heard
kölsch
beers
described
as
the
light
easydrinking
girly
beer
when
a
german
doesnt
want
a
big
heavy
brew
not
that
id
use
those
exact
words
but
the
basic
concept
was
right
on
the
money
the
reissdorf
kölsch
is
great
simple
elegant
refreshing
balanced
its
everything
i
want
from
a
kölsch
and
its
executed
perfectly
o
great
after
you
mow
the
lawn
or
do
something
of
that
nature
im
excited
for
this
style
lets
hops
americans
can
do
similar
sessionability
very
yes
dr
very
drinkable
good
quality
i
wont
have
it
again
but
its
enjoyable
o
i
would
enjoy
more
than
one
and
overall
its
a
good
beer
however
ive
had
several
other
kolschs
that
i
enjoyed
more
o
very
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
extremely
crisp
finish
for
my
first
kolsch
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
overall
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
o
excellent
brew
to
quaff
the
day
away
overall
nice
clean
crisp
beer
for
an
ale
a
bit
too
light
even
for
a
kolsch
overall
good
beer
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
beer
that
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
will
be
buying
more
worth
a
try
d
quite
quaffable
qq
i
think
this
would
be
a
wonderful
lawnmower
beer
for
those
hot
summer
months
overall
impression
if
i
were
to
take
my
friends
to
itap
that
only
usually
drink
bmc
product
i
would
suggest
this
one
to
them
because
it
was
boring
and
could
drink
the
shit
out
of
it
really
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
will
still
call
it
average
had
even
a
hint
of
apple
that
was
interesting
but
too
light
to
even
pick
up
any
ingredient
list
from
this
brew
o
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
an
excellent
kolsch
probably
the
best
ive
had
these
beers
have
a
light
and
smooth
feel
but
a
good
one
really
does
have
a
rich
flavor
and
smell
to
boot
this
one
delivers
its
a
bit
pricey
around
these
parts
but
if
youre
feeling
good
on
a
particular
day
and
want
something
refreshing
and
flavorful
check
reissdorf
out
an
incredibly
awesome
german
kölschone
of
my
all
time
favorites
i
could
drink
a
shitton
of
this
beer
all
summer
long
pours
a
golden
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
aroma
and
taste
of
caramel
malt
yeast
some
sweet
fruity
esters
and
a
light
grassy
note
with
some
light
hops
light
body
and
carbonation
on
the
palate
finish
is
sweet
malt
some
biscuit
and
yeast
and
light
hops
on
the
ending
give
it
nice
balance
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
brew
drinkability
good
stuff
i
am
now
convinced
my
german
ancestors
were
not
big
beer
drinkers
if
they
were
they
must
have
emigrated
due
to
crushing
economic
or
social
pressures
i
would
recommend
this
beer
especially
in
the
hot
summer
o
just
too
sweet
for
me
ill
likely
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
it
has
a
crisp
moderate
bite
just
right
this
is
what
they
asire
to
i
dont
necessarily
need
to
drink
this
over
and
over
though
hopefully
i
can
get
to
germany
bucket
list
item
and
get
some
on
tap
some
day
i
am
a
big
hophead
which
means
that
i
tend
to
shy
away
from
lighter
fare
but
with
this
beer
the
kolsch
style
has
a
new
fan
simple
honest
and
good
this
is
a
lawn
mower
beer
for
the
person
whose
fridge
is
otherwise
filled
with
dogfish
head
60
or
90
minute
ipa
and
pliny
the
elder
dvery
tasty
and
drinkable
perfect
on
a
hot
day
after
a
trip
to
the
dmv
on
tap
sat
night
at
penguin
pizza
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
bright
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
white
head
smell
had
a
distinct
aroma
of
citrus
and
lemon
which
i
liked
the
taste
was
very
light
on
both
the
hops
and
the
malt
i
would
say
this
beer
is
light
bodied
but
thats
a
given
very
smooth
body
and
low
in
alcohol
this
beer
was
made
specifically
so
you
could
drink
a
few
and
i
could
have
easily
a
decent
beer
but
not
the
best
rep
from
germany
or
of
this
style
good
to
try
an
authentic
kolsch
and
see
that
most
us
brewers
are
poseurs
at
this
style
o
overall
a
pretty
decent
kölsch
light
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
little
bit
of
light
fruit
to
it
would
give
it
another
shot
a
firm
hoppy
character
gives
it
a
dry
bitter
finish
its
clean
crisp
and
very
refreshing
probably
experiencing
the
crispness
due
to
its
bubbly
concoction
light
in
taste
and
soft
on
the
palate
i
was
pretty
pleased
with
this
german
ale
the
low
abv
makes
this
beer
highly
drinkable
even
for
brunch
notes
a
rather
tasty
beer
and
very
drinkable
great
on
a
summer
night
or
day
cheers
o
great
example
of
a
kolsch
slight
fruit
flavors
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
with
balance
and
crispness
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
o
highly
recommended
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
so
refreshing
by
itself
a
great
lawnmower
beer
a
nice
thing
to
offer
your
friends
who
are
less
open
to
ales
as
it
is
a
nice
upgrade
from
your
conventional
adjunct
lager
poured
a
2
white
soap
suds
head
clear
straw
yellow
in
color
not
really
any
smell
at
all
and
not
just
when
cold
but
even
after
the
sample
warmed
simple
bmc
taste
profile
and
although
some
other
reviews
id
read
mentioned
apple
and
other
things
i
didnt
get
any
of
that
watery
there
is
sort
of
a
melted
ice
water
after
taste
hey
at
least
there
was
no
skunking
narrative
siiick
eliminator
brotorch
ah
shit
they
brought
this
guy
again
god
damn
tevin
jacobs
ahhh
cant
wait
to
load
this
up
with
sick
girls
grills
shots
schwaaaazeee
hes
is
trailing
off
again
with
what
is
debatably
not
even
a
real
word
why
do
they
always
bring
this
guy
around
he
is
so
irritating
and
then
i
was
all
like
this
oh
great
now
he
is
grinding
all
over
my
dads
speedboat
they
always
say
hes
great
to
have
around
at
parties
but
just
a
few
minutes
of
this
tevin
and
i
am
already
sick
of
him
so
i
always
tell
chicks
like
ok
think
about
it
you
could
never
get
pregnant
on
another
planet
because
the
gravity
is
all
different
it
would
straight
pull
it
down
and
i
just
i
cant
sit
here
and
listen
to
this
butchering
of
science
yo
bro
can
you
hit
me
with
a
michelob
ultra
tryna
hit
up
the
gym
sitch
later
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
you
could
pound
at
a
barbaque
or
just
loafing
about
on
a
warm
summers
day
overall
a
very
solid
yet
relatively
simple
beer
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
and
not
get
sick
of
it
o
very
good
reminded
me
of
a
czech
pils
very
tasty
pours
a
lovely
golden
color
with
big
white
headalmost
two
fingers
the
beer
is
almost
see
though
with
alot
of
notes
of
earthly
malts
it
smells
very
crisp
and
clean
with
good
hop
sense
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
perfect
for
this
style
of
beer
with
just
enough
balance
of
hops
and
almost
fruit
like
quality
goes
down
very
easy
and
would
be
a
stable
during
hot
summer
months
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anybody
that
is
a
fan
of
the
kolsch
style
of
german
beers
cheers
fantastic
example
of
the
kölsch
style
truly
a
reminder
as
to
why
i
love
german
brews
to
date
this
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
i
picked
up
a
few
5l
singles
at
total
wine
in
town
as
part
of
a
sample
pack
of
german
beers
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
summer
brew
and
an
ultimate
beat
the
heat
thirst
quencher
love
it
great
overall
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
really
good
beer
for
those
warm
summer
nights
wish
these
were
available
in
six
packs
and
at
a
slightly
more
reasonable
cost
i
dont
know
the
calorie
count
on
this
but
it
was
like
a
light
beer
with
a
whole
lot
more
flavor
and
mouthfeel
nice
and
makes
me
want
to
try
more
from
the
style
verdict
good
not
great
and
not
spectacular
m
lots
of
carbonation
on
this
one
gives
it
a
very
crisp
clean
feel
totally
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
went
great
with
dinner
poured
a
light
clear
yellow
with
a
large
white
frothy
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
of
grain
malts
herbal
hops
and
a
leathery
yeast
with
notes
of
citrus
it
tasted
very
light
and
slightly
bitter
form
beginning
to
end
with
the
finish
being
rather
light
in
flavor
with
a
hint
of
lemon
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
soft
carbonation
overall
a
very
mild
brew
with
not
much
taste
d
very
refreshing
and
decent
tasting
nothing
special
but
would
be
nice
to
drink
when
youve
got
something
else
going
on
decent
sessioner
if
it
were
more
complex
but
perhaps
thats
not
the
strong
suit
of
a
kolsch
first
time
for
the
this
style
and
very
impressed
will
recommend
and
get
again
appears
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
bone
white
head
and
little
lace
aroma
full
of
bready
malts
very
clean
flavors
definately
some
liquid
breadloafy
moments
noble
hops
are
there
with
a
light
presence
and
bitterness
balance
is
perfect
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
smooth
and
crisp
easy
to
consume
would
certainly
have
it
again
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
d
i
could
definitely
sit
and
have
3
or
4
of
these
great
drinkability
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
the
nice
german
pale
malts
and
fruity
esters
from
the
yeast
the
kiss
of
balancing
hops
very
nice
especially
at
only
4
8
abv
mouthfeel
is
light
drinkability
is
high
and
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
carbonation
is
active
and
works
well
it
not
the
kind
of
over
carbonation
you
might
see
in
more
domestic
examples
of
this
beer
it
right
were
ti
needs
to
be
not
overly
assertive
looks
very
nice
poured
in
its
own
kölsch
glass
golden
clear
body
with
2
fingers
of
head
not
a
lot
of
activity
in
there
though
smells
up
front
very
grainy
and
bready
its
pleasant
the
taste
matches
this
but
im
getting
a
tinge
of
metal
nice
light
bodied
beer
ill
try
this
again
in
the
summer
though
drinkability
super
drinkable
need
i
say
more
can
not
be
better
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
had
nearly
perfect
d
really
light
and
easy
to
drink
like
you
would
expect
from
a
kolsch

complaints

with
the
sweet
bready

the
predominant

finishing
is
wheaty
with
a

not
my
favorite

certainly
a
good

the
style

is
correct

great
drinking
session
german
ale
i
could
picture
myself
sitting
in
a
koln
bierhall
drinking
from
a
kolsch
glass
being
served
by
a
kolbe
for
the
better
portion
of
a
sunny
afternoon
its
nice
when
just
tasting
a
beer
can
give
you
that
experience
in
your
mind
flavor
is
very
much
built
around
pale
cereal
grains
and
light
herbal
hops
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
from
the
ale
yeast
strain
this
is
what
most
american
brewers
attempt
when
formulatnig
an
american
blonde
ale
few
succeed
the
way
this
beer
does
mouthfeel
is
clean
crisp
light
bodied
effervescent
carbonation
drinkability
overall
is
excellent
like
i
said
its
pure
refreshment
perfect
for
mass
consumption
too
bad
its
4
50
for
a
half
liter
in
the
pittsburgh
market
d
very
drinkable
a
good
repeatable
beer
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
hop
presence
and
basically
a
standard
lager
smell
in
the
taste
small
hints
of
earth
and
fruitiness
but
still
standard
lager
kind
of
taste
a
small
bite
but
mainly
smooth
and
a
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
to
clean
light
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
i
like
it
but
kind
of
standard
euro
light
lager
nothing
wrong
with
this
except
it
has
virtually
no
flavor
d
very
good
very
drinkable
id
have
it
more
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
taste
is
meh
biscuity
with
cereals
and
grains
rounds
into
a
very
slight
citrusy
hop
profile
finishes
like
nothing
at
all
literally
no
lingering
flavors
besides
the
dry
cereal
refreshing
i
guess
boring
most
certainly
i
think
if
you
put
this
brew
inside
a
bud
light
bottle
the
ratings
would
go
from
a
b
to
a
d
nice
mouthfeel
though
light
crisp
medium
amount
of
prickly
natural
carbonation
if
this
is
a
good
kolsch
it
will
be
my
last
of
the
style
thats
for
sure
really
reminds
me
of
an
adjunct
lager
that
just
so
happens
to
be
an
ale
pass
this
is
a
very
wellmade
kölsch
an
ideal
warmweather
or
session
beer
drinkability
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
hint
of
fruitiness
good
example
of
the
style
reissdorf
is
truly
the
standard
when
it
comes
to
kolsch
clean
lightbodied
and
very
pairable
with
many
types
of
food
its
extremely
sessionable
the
simplicity
of
reissdorf
kölsch
means
that
it
will
pair
well
with
various
foods
it
is
important
however
to
choose
foods
that
will
not
overwhelm
the
delicacy
of
the
beer
try
it
with
a
summer
salad
of
fresh
greens
grilled
beets
and
your
local
goats
milk
cheese
it
would
also
drink
well
with
a
vegetable
frittata
or
shellfish
it
is
a
great
substitute
for
riesling
or
gewurztraminer
in
any
kind
of
food
pairing
with
this
in
mind
try
it
with
a
light
nutty
cheese
such
as
piave
vecchio
which
is
made
from
cows
milk
in
northern
italy
overall
a
great
beer
and
my
first
kolsch
i
hope
to
try
others
in
this
category
someday
although
they
seem
pretty
hard
to
come
by
clear
thin
yellow
pilsnercolor
with
a
thin
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
light
aroma
of
light
malts
lemon
and
grass
hops
hint
of
honey
sweetness
feel
is
thin
and
crisp
refreshing
clean
light
malts
and
lemongrass
hops
crisp
carbonation
generates
some
belching
but
isnt
offensive
a
hint
of
skunk
a
great
german
kolsh
and
a
great
end
to
my
heavenly
tasting
session
at
novare
res
drinkability
a
very
easy
drink
but
full
of
flavor
and
texture
i
feel
that
it
has
a
bit
of
a
heaviness
to
it
that
may
limit
one
from
consuming
too
many
of
these
like
some
lighter
summer
beers
did
i
say
creamy
this
was
poured
for
me
and
the
server
produced
two
fingers
worth
of
quickly
dissipating
bonewhite
head
the
beer
was
a
beautiful
goldenyellow
color
with
neplus
quality
clarity
the
nose
was
faint
with
saaz
hops
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
very
dry
quality
on
the
tongue
finish
was
zephyr
winddry
with
a
lingering
taste
of
saaz
hops
for
those
who
have
heard
me
rave
about
bryan
lil
guy
selders
kolsch
at
neversink
just
before
it
sank
this
was
as
close
to
it
as
i
have
found
very
impressive
this
is
a
worthwhile
beer
in
this
age
of
extreme
beers
it
is
reassuring
to
know
that
there
are
lovely
examples
of
classic
simple
styles
that
you
can
fall
back
on
if
need
be
this
was
a
quick
thirst
quenching
glass
that
was
easy
to
drink
i
probably
would
have
ordered
another
if
it
was
in
better
condition
overall
well
balanced
and
very
refreshing
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
it
first
kolsch
for
me
and
i
did
like
it
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
sometime
not
a
particularly
outstanding
beer
for
my
tastes
but
a
quality
product
just
not
a
style
i
particularly
love
but
i
think
its
pretty
well
done
for
what
it
is
d
this
is
the
best
kölsch
that
i
have
drank
and
could
easily
spend
a
day
with
this
beer
alone
i
will
be
sure
to
drink
it
when
i
can
find
it
on
tap
especially
during
the
warm
months
d
a
good
beer
and
great
kölsch
but
i
cant
get
past
the
sulphur
a
very
nice
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
sticky
white
head
aroma
is
clean
and
metalic
flavor
is
great
very
smooth
with
that
nice
crisp
bitter
bite
at
the
end
its
at
first
almost
a
little
sweet
but
then
smooth
outs
to
the
bitter
bite
you
want
from
the
style
super
drinkible
i
wish
i
could
find
these
in
bottles
to
keep
in
the
fridge
this
summer
from
the
500
ml
bottle
sampled
on
june
6
2010
it
pours
an
excitably
carbonated
pale
yellow
with
a
shortlasting
fizzy
head
the
aroma
was
malty
although
more
skunky
than
i
would
have
liked
it
was
a
turnoff
the
taste
was
somewhat
better
with
bit
of
grainy
malt
thin
hops
but
a
great
body
poured
light
golden
with
a
white
sticky
head
smell
was
clean
malty
with
hints
of
dried
fruit
taste
is
deliciously
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
but
bitter
after
the
sip
an
easily
drinkable
brew
exceptionally
drinkable
all
the
lightness
of
a
light
american
lager
in
an
ale
without
bitterness
or
other
harsh
flavors
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
like
a
session
beer
to
quench
a
massive
thirst
hats
off
to
the
fellows
in
germany
that
brewed
such
a
wonderful
beer
renewed
my
faith
in
this
style
im
a
born
again
kolschstian
easy
going
dryness
makes
this
one
hard
to
put
down
and
the
attractve
cylinder
showng
a
golden
beer
in
all
its
glory
is
equally
alluring
overall
i
thought
this
tasted
almost
identical
on
cask
as
it
did
on
tap
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
softer
and
the
hops
seemed
sharper
this
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
allowed
to
drop
bright
and
i
didnt
get
very
much
yeast
anyways
a
solid
beer
worth
a
shot
from
any
medium
likely
better
if
its
fresh
8414
finally
a
bottle
that
is
only
slightly
past
ideal
age
it
took
years
to
run
into
one
bumped
up
score
from
3
73
bet
it
would
be
higher
a
few
months
ago
d
a
great
standard
by
which
to
judge
the
style
as
this
brew
delivers
all
of
the
classic
style
features
and
is
a
joy
to
drink
d
a
solid
example
of
the
style
from
the
city
in
which
it
originated
good
stuff
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
grainy
sweetness
funky
grassy
light
fruit
and
a
crisp
finish
this
isnt
a
style
that
i
would
normally
seek
out
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
kolsh
ive
had
to
date
d
its
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
which
quenches
your
thirst
and
is
very
refreshing
this
is
very
sessionable
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
md
very
light
with
spot
on
carbonation
this
seems
like
a
great
summertime
beer
to
me
always
saw
people
say
this
but
seems
session
worthy
to
me
decent
but
nothing
real
exciting
its
like
a
better
done
version
of
of
your
standard
us
macro
lager
if
you
like
more
dry
beers
this
would
be
a
great
example
of
kolsch
for
you
i
prefer
slightly
more
evident
hops
florals
and
a
touch
more
sweet
malts
but
this
one
is
great
and
if
i
were
back
in
koln
and
this
was
the
featured
beer
id
be
sessioning
taste
is
wheaty
and
sweet
but
really
light
its
good
but
pretty
plain
and
dull
a
decent
session
ale
but
still
a
good
beer
worth
trying
cant
beat
the
drinkability
i
love
the
dry
finish
and
it
just
seems
like
the
ideal
beer
for
barbecuing
outside
or
drinking
after
mowing
the
lawn
good
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
decent
fluffy
white
head
average
but
not
offputting
aroma
is
average
strength
malty
and
just
a
tad
watery
however
the
aroma
is
this
beers
weakest
aspect
flavor
is
strong
crisp
and
malty
with
a
fruity
overtone
texture
is
smooth
lively
and
fizzy
nice
clear
bronzebrass
color
with
a
massive
foamy
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
astringent
grassy
yeasty
sweet
malty
carmel
aromas
taste
mimicks
the
aroma
almost
exactly
but
with
a
metallic
finish
perfect
creamy
texture
and
good
body
and
carbonation
easy
drinking
amazing
golden
color
with
great
carbonation
awesome
yeast
aroma
and
an
overall
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
afternoon
d
obviously
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
perfect
in
the
summer
after
a
long
day
of
work
d
a
more
drinkable
beer
may
not
exist
not
only
is
this
fairly
low
in
alcohol
but
the
flavors
are
so
subtle
that
my
palate
could
handle
liters
before
tiring
a
fine
example
of
an
underappreciated
style
kolsch
is
too
viewed
as
an
alternative
for
the
noninitiate
instead
of
a
style
capable
of
high
regard
d
this
is
immensely
drinkable
delicious
as
a
stand
alone
or
paired
o
this
style
is
too
easy
going
for
me
and
4
for
a
bomber
never
again
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
but
overall
the
body
is
thin
which
is
fine
there
is
a
wheaty
aftertaste
and
a
forward
sweetness
its
a
good
kolsch
not
many
examples
drinkability
is
high
mouthfeel
is
fine
d
this
type
of
beer
and
ones
similar
are
becoming
my
favorite
brews
in
the
world
the
second
time
ive
had
this
and
after
the
first
sip
i
cannot
believe
that
i
forgot
about
it
so
quickly
one
of
my
top
brews
now
try
one
on
it
fits
nicely
d
nothing
too
special
this
is
a
good
warm
weather
session
candidate
slightly
creamier
and
more
honeyfocused
than
others
of
the
style
not
bad
at
all
deep
gold
in
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
fair
retention
and
lace
smells
of
grainy
malts
and
faint
grassy
hops
not
much
depth
in
the
nose
tastes
vinous
with
an
unappealing
strength
cereal
and
corny
finish
the
finish
really
kills
this
one
light
bodied
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
to
it
not
so
nice
really
tastes
like
an
adjunct
lager
that
just
so
happens
to
be
an
ale
recommend
against
a
very
pleasant
experience
very
drinkable
makes
for
an
outstanding
session
beer
some
more
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
this
truly
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
could
drink
all
night
excellent
kolsch
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
aroma
is
sweet
and
grassy
a
crystal
clear
yellow
color
with
white
frothy
head
that
reduces
but
good
lacing
a
light
touch
of
fruity
sourness
a
mediium
body
creamy
texture
and
lively
carbonation
very
long
soft
and
pleasing
finish
i
really
like
this
beer
and
could
drink
these
several
of
these
at
a
sitting
this
beer
is
very
true
to
the
kolsch
style
and
a
great
example
of
it
light
ales
and
lagers
are
not
my
favorite
but
you
have
to
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
of
a
classic
style
d
not
a
brew
for
those
that
love
big
bold
flavors
well
crafted
with
a
delicate
flavor
m
d
light
bodied
with
nice
co2
content
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
perfect
d
very
good
pours
nice
golden
straw
with
a
sudsy
white
head
with
little
retention
very
refreshing
and
delicious
looking
beer
for
a
late
afternoon
has
a
grainy
nose
oddly
enough
it
reminds
me
exactly
how
rolling
rock
smelled
to
me
as
a
kid
when
my
parents
drank
it
and
had
my
first
tastes
of
beer
some
citrus
and
sweet
malt
cant
really
detect
any
hops
has
some
sweet
malt
upfront
oat
then
citrus
and
viney
twang
and
a
bitter
hop
bite
on
the
back
very
crisp
on
the
palate
with
nice
carbonation
this
is
a
very
refreshing
light
bodied
beer
good
for
a
warm
day
session
i
possess
the
dna
marker
that
amplifies
bitter
perception
hence
most
beers
taste
like
bug
spray
this
was
the
first
beer
that
i
and
my
siblings
tasted
and
said
wow
beer
can
taste
like
that
smooth
light
carbonation
can
be
served
slightly
less
than
room
temp
but
not
too
cold
mouth
feel
is
thin
crisp
prickly
and
refreshing
overall
good
for
style
except
for
carbonation
which
is
most
likely
not
the
germans
fault
in
this
case
overall
this
was
one
that
went
down
pretty
good
i
expected
more
out
of
this
one
though
and
have
had
some
others
in
the
style
that
i
liked
alot
better
dry
clean
and
a
decent
summer
brew
not
something
id
grab
often
but
i
will
revisit
again
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
bland
i
think
this
is
about
germanys
budlight
very
clean
on
the
palate
quite
crisp
and
quite
delecious
certainly
an
easy
drinker
and
a
beer
that
is
easily
sessionable
and
quite
frankly
i
would
recommend
many
sessions
of
this
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
an
excellent
summer
choice
if
your
craving
a
tall
glass
of
refreshing
brew
overall
i
didnt
find
anything
particularly
spectacular
here
but
nothing
particularly
bad
either
worth
a
try
and
a
pretty
good
thirst
quencher
a
bit
middleoftheroad
here
ive
had
better
not
hard
to
drink
but
not
impressive
d
super
drinkable
a
wonderful
restorative
after
a
90
degree
day
and
a
great
way
to
precede
a
meal
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
the
kolsch
style
but
this
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
brew
drinkability
this
is
an
enjoyable
refreshing
easy
to
drink
beer
that
would
be
easy
to
consume
more
and
more
of
either
with
food
or
for
an
evening
of
good
conversation
over
several
beers
overall
a
decent
kolsch
very
accurate
to
the
style
but
just
not
alot
of
spunk
a
good
brew
overall
just
a
wonderful
masterfully
crafted
brew
out
of
köln
brewed
in
the
kölsch
tradition
with
passion
and
full
attention
overall
this
beer
is
so
complimentary
that
it
is
easy
to
overlook
standing
as
an
strong
example
of
the
kolsch
style
the
light
refreshing
character
of
reissdorf
coupled
with
its
low
abv
make
for
one
heck
of
a
session
brew
good
refreshing
beer
d
i
understand
that
each
brewer
needs
to
differentiate
their
product
from
other
brewers
but
the
little
funk
to
my
kolsch
prevented
me
from
getting
that
full
clean
crisp
taste
i
was
looking
for
this
is
a
nice
little
summer
quaffer
i
would
like
to
have
it
on
hand
more
often
but
it
is
not
widely
available
where
i
am
i
could
drink
this
beer
aaall
day
long
put
this
in
my
had
instead
of
a
coors
light
at
an
as
game
and
ill
be
in
heaven
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
small
white
head
smells
a
hint
of
yeasty
phenols
taste
is
light
and
dry
a
koln
yeast
strain
crackery
malt
with
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
finish
is
also
quite
clean
mouthfeel
is
good
slightly
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
also
good
one
of
the
best
kolschs
i
have
had
recommended
a
good
all
around
kolsch
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
good
head
that
dissipates
in
a
short
time
carries
a
sweet
smell
as
well
as
a
floral
accent
crisp
clean
taste
with
a
well
balanced
hop
malt
flavor
and
a
light
fruity
character
white
grapes
despite
the
500ml
bottle
this
stands
as
a
great
session
beer
in
my
book
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
notes
like
a
lemon
pilsner
tasty
and
refreshing
light
like
a
macro
but
with
class
and
style
and
the
subtlety
to
stand
out
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
crisp
but
not
overdone
carbonation
never
masks
the
flavor
and
drinkability
is
as
is
to
be
expected
of
this
style
superb
this
one
more
than
many
others
ive
tried
possibly
my
1
favorite
summer
style
beautiful
beer
poured
a
wellcarbonated
golden
body
with
a
onefinger
head
that
slowly
receeds
a
biscuity
and
fruity
like
grape
smell
lightbodied
tad
slick
and
smooth
has
a
pilslike
crispness
with
that
faint
smoke
veg
effect
for
dryness
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
fruit
flavors
like
grape
and
tropical
along
with
some
sweet
malts
make
this
an
easydrinking
and
very
enjoyable
beer
i
havent
had
too
many
of
this
style
but
is
growing
upon
me
this
particular
beer
was
a
perfect
complement
to
my
sunday
brunch
not
bad
and
from
all
indications
this
beer
traveled
pretty
darn
well
i
never
expected
to
introduce
any
kölsch
into
my
normal
beer
buying
patterns
but
it
may
be
time
to
make
room
especially
for
the
summer
would
be
a
fantastic
session
beer
out
of
the
keg
taste
is
the
same
very
light
and
refreshing
my
wife
said
it
didnt
taste
like
beer
which
for
her
is
a
good
thing
so
i
think
it
hits
the
style
spot
well
no
lingering
aftertaste
just
balanced
and
quaffable
not
very
complex
but
very
nice
and
light
on
the
palate
an
easy
drinker
a
very
session
type
beer
very
fresh
from
the
tap
dont
know
if
a
bottle
from
across
the
ocean
would
go
so
well
d
extremely
drinkablesessionable
due
to
the
low
abv
and
enjoyable
but
never
overpowering
flavor
taste
is
delicious
not
much
else
to
say
what
a
great
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
not
incredibly
complex
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
drinkability
is
very
much
here
a
perfect
beer
to
have
several
of
on
a
warm
summer
day
at
a
bbq
with
light
fare
cheers
with
friends
the
minikegs
go
down
fast
a
little
too
fast
really
overall
a
nice
well
balanced
drinkable
beer
very
drinkable
a
classic
kolsh
done
really
well
very
light
easy
to
drink
but
not
without
taste
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
gold
color
the
head
was
pure
white
displayed
good
retention
as
a
thin
skim
and
left
pretty
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
dry
and
grainy
with
pleasant
floral
hops
and
pale
malt
notes
the
flavors
were
an
excellent
example
of
a
traditional
kolsch
i
tasted
a
great
balance
of
floral
hops
dry
grains
and
hints
of
sweetness
from
the
pale
malt
acidic
very
refreshing
and
totally
sessionable
the
body
was
light
the
carbonation
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
average
very
springlike
just
as
a
kolsch
should
be
d
nice
and
light
great
summer
beer
overall
a
great
beer
for
the
beer
drinker
who
doesnt
want
to
be
caught
with
an
american
lager
again
what
american
macros
only
dream
of
being
its
gold
has
some
carbonation
bubbles
in
the
body
and
has
some
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
aroma
is
fruity
if
you
fruit
skins
and
pears
your
nose
should
be
happy
taste
is
more
pilsneresque
but
its
not
often
i
drink
kolsch
sweet
pilsner
malt
is
obvious
hay
and
wood
notes
dominante
the
background
of
the
beer
is
this
a
pils
no
it
isnt
but
i
did
enjoy
it
went
well
washing
down
an
awesome
brat
at
wurstkuche
reissdorf
kölsch
is
a
very
clear
light
yellow
beer
with
a
small
white
ring
for
a
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
pretzely
wooden
and
most
of
all
fruity
it
sure
smells
german
it
is
light
bodied
prickly
on
the
tongue
but
quite
smooth
the
finish
is
a
little
metallic
but
clean
it
tastes
lightly
sweet
and
lightly
bitter
its
pretty
quenching
not
that
dry
this
is
squarely
in
the
session
realm
d
after
a
steady
diet
of
big
beers
i
really
had
to
shift
gears
to
get
into
the
subtlety
of
this
the
last
two
kölsch
style
beers
i
had
made
me
wonder
if
this
simply
wasnt
the
style
for
me
because
those
beers
didnt
do
much
for
me
this
however
was
a
complete
turnaround
from
those
im
quite
glad
i
picked
it
up
there
are
many
much
tastier
beers
that
i
have
given
a
lower
score
what
makes
this
one
so
good
is
its
lack
of
flaws
and
effortless
drinkability
more
please
well
carbonated
light
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
dry
finish
i
was
really
surprised
that
i
liked
this
one
as
much
as
i
did
overall
this
is
a
very
good
refreshing
beer
and
one
that
may
be
better
enjoyed
during
the
hot
summer
months
wow
so
crisp
and
refreshing
its
a
crying
shame
that
this
is
not
more
widely
available
this
will
be
mandatory
in
my
fridge
from
here
on
give
this
a
try
for
sure
especially
if
youre
looking
for
a
warmweather
brew
or
a
lighter
session
beer
reissdorf
for
me
anyway
is
the
standard
by
which
all
other
kölsch
beers
and
their
imitators
are
measured
pure
bone
white
head
that
dissolves
into
a
patchwork
quilt
across
the
surface
the
lacing
holds
on
in
a
spotty
manner
too
bright
yellow
color
with
a
green
streak
while
fully
transparent
theres
nothing
that
makes
you
think
it
is
pale
or
dilute
very
fresh
and
open
nose
sliced
white
bread
golden
wheat
green
corn
husk
orange
infused
spring
water
while
on
the
hops
side
of
things
theres
nothing
bitter
nor
biting
about
the
nose
just
a
gentle
unfolding
of
beer
inside
your
nostrils
mediumbodied
with
feeling
carbonated
it
swells
inside
the
mouth
and
takes
up
as
much
space
as
possible
just
not
pushing
down
into
the
tongue
moderately
sweeter
with
elements
of
pink
grapefruit
orange
citrus
and
pineapple
nectarine
peach
fruit
none
of
which
dramatically
change
the
overall
dry
and
crisp
character
of
the
beer
for
here
the
hops
are
indeed
bitterer
and
add
a
nice
vibrancy
to
the
mouthfeel
theres
a
toasted
powdery
quality
to
the
malts
like
sticking
a
wet
finger
into
malted
milk
powder
flavor
is
not
what
this
beer
is
about
its
texture
movement
and
quenching
your
thirst
an
important
aside
the
whole
kolsch
style
seems
to
be
very
underrated
here
on
ba
lets
keep
in
mind
that
kolsch
is
a
fairly
simple
straightforward
style
as
we
rate
them
and
not
knock
their
grades
down
because
they
lack
the
mystique
and
complexity
of
a
belgian
quadruple
refreshing
brew
and
very
good
for
style
d
i
suspect
id
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
more
if
i
had
several
over
the
course
of
a
night
out
with
friends
its
the
sort
of
beer
you
can
drink
all
day
without
really
thinking
about
it
no
real
complexity
to
speak
of
but
endlessly
refreshing
easy
to
drink
beer
would
gladly
sit
down
and
session
these
things
at
4
8
abv
this
is
one
fine
and
drinkable
beer
would
love
to
get
a
fresher
bottle
into
my
hands
as
i
am
sure
it
would
be
fantastic
an
excellent
replacement
for
a
bmc
lawnmower
beer
i
couldnt
imagine
what
would
be
better
on
a
hot
day
than
a
fresh
one
of
these
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
soapy
sticky
white
head
corny
pale
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
slight
bitter
hop
twang
light
but
very
balanced
and
inviting
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
clean
fresh
flavor
roasted
pale
malt
light
grassyness
and
bitterness
from
the
hops
light
in
body
great
carbonation
and
extremely
high
drinkability
i
think
i
just
found
my
new
lawn
mower
beer
without
a
doubt
has
a
very
translucent
yellow
color
with
head
that
has
the
consistency
of
soda
pop
fizz
the
smell
is
mainly
of
corn
husk
and
grains
the
taste
has
more
corn
husk
characteristics
and
a
decent
amount
of
malty
sweetness
very
light
in
body
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
light
on
the
abv
good
body
good
taste
great
for
session
a
nice
goldenyellow
color
the
smell
was
light
and
hard
to
detect
i
was
hoping
to
smell
something
but
couldnt
the
taste
was
dry
and
had
a
nice
hop
bite
to
it
not
overpowering
very
easy
to
drink
i
did
detect
a
little
sweetness
to
the
beer
it
was
almost
not
noticeable
a
decent
brew
would
work
well
with
a
summer
salad
worth
the
try
if
your
looking
for
something
outside
of
pale
ales
or
stouts
a
great
style
drinkability
is
very
high
this
would
be
a
good
replacement
for
many
of
the
bmc
drinkers
standby
beer
very
nice
kolsch
beer
that
has
a
deep
rich
golden
color
and
a
spectacular
white
foamy
head
that
produces
exceptional
lacing
a
nice
subtle
malty
nose
leads
into
a
great
mild
sweet
malt
on
the
palate
with
just
the
right
hint
of
hops
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
this
silky
brew
flows
across
the
tongue
with
a
great
thick
smoothness
that
makes
it
good
drinking
in
warm
or
cool
weather
this
is
a
good
session
beer
hightly
drinkable
as
it
satisfies
while
not
being
too
heavy
would
drink
again
soon
flavor
was
dry
and
crisp
with
a
healthy
yet
clean
bitter
dose
saved
for
the
finish
not
much
sweetness
or
honey
to
the
malts
just
lightly
toasted
biscuits
and
a
soft
graininess
the
hops
were
equally
as
gentle
delivering
a
delicate
floral
bitterness
to
the
back
of
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
excellent
with
a
light
body
and
livid
carbonation
level
that
leaves
the
tongue
dry
and
at
the
same
time
quenched
id
gladly
have
this
again
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
during
a
cold
novembers
eve
hooray
for
the
kölsch
style
500

not

but
nice

light

apples
green

medium

light
bodied
bready
white
grape

not
quite
ripe
nectarine
ends
a
bit
dry
with
a
hardwater
feel
d
exceptional
up
there
with
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
carbonation
is
pleasantly
strong
and
gives
a
good
punch
to
the
medium
body
and
smooth
feel
a
terrific
beer
overall
kolsch
are
easy
drinking
and
could
not
turn
any
of
them
away
so
give
it
a
try
i
find
the
bottled
version
to
have
a
bit
more
bite
to
it
than
the
draft
version
also
one
of
the
finer
kolschs
that
ive
had
this
has
a
beer
aftertaste
this
is
a
fruity
beer
and
a
manly
beer
its
a
fruity
manly
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
macro
yellow
color
with
a
decent
three
finger
head
that
recedes
quickly
leaving
behind
very
little
lacing
strong
aroma
of
skunk
and
and
husky
grassy
grains
smells
a
little
overcooked
im
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
is
but
it
doesnt
smell
very
fresh
tastes
of
grainy
malt
slightly
bitter
a
little
fruitiness
some
lemon
zest
and
hints
of
honey
very
grassy
and
slightly
spicy
hops
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
tongue
not
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
as
this
one
seems
to
have
some
age
on
it
but
its
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
nonetheless
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
clean
full
of
flavours
of
bread
hay
apple
white
grape
juice
lemon
hints
of
honey
and
vanilla
its
slightly
on
the
dryish
side
lively
with
a
light
tartness
in
the
finish
i
quite
enjoyed
this
kolsch
out
on
my
patio
this
evening
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
d
a
beer
on
first
taste
i
didnt
think
all
that
much
of
but
it
certainly
grows
on
you
would
make
a
fantastic
warm
weather
beer
or
a
hot
2nd
day
of
fall
beer
this
is
a
very
well
executed
straightforward
beer
qualifies
as
a
truly
exceptional
lawnmower
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
this
style
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
thing
in
the
world
but
a
good
beer
this
a
very
refreshing
session
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
day
drinkability
this
would
make
an
excellent
beer
for
those
lazy
summer
afternoons
a
bubbly
yellow
gold
body
supports
a
pure
white
fluffy
head
in
an
ayinger
altbier
glass
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
wheat
to
aid
the
smoothness
with
little
complexity
as
per
the
style
this
is
one
summer
slamming
beer
slightly
creamy
soft
mediumbodied
offeringi
like
its
presenceand
the
subsequent
effortless
drinkability
strong
metallic
malts
almost
pilsneresque
slight
fruitiness
but
not
overt
a
bit
bready
too
as
michael
jackson
calls
this
a
delicate
style
i
too
find
little
difference
between
this
and
others
whether
it
be
gaffel
or
saranac
but
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
knowing
the
styles
limitations
and
the
pleasant
drinking
rewards
this
was
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
im
not
a
huge
kolsch
fan
but
the
reissdorf
will
make
a
convert
of
anyone
the
beer
is
light
spritzy
with
lots
of
efforvescence
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
sets
itself
apart
by
the
unmistakeable
white
grape
skin
vinous
character
of
the
brew
this
is
about
as
close
to
pouring
a
chardonnay
in
a
beer
as
you
will
find
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
champagne
like
quality
to
the
beer
albeit
with
a
lot
less
efforvescence
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
it
is
just
a
great
refreshing
summer
time
beer
very
sessionable
lchaim
a
fine
summer
beer
served
in
a
cylindrical
12
oz
glass
appears
a
clear
gold
with
a
short
white
head
the
aroma
and
then
following
flavor
immediately
remind
me
of
white
grape
juice
oh
man
theres
then
a
drier
light
toast
barley
note
for
balance
and
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
there
was
also
a
slight
white
winelike
acidity
to
this
one
which
didnt
detract
so
much
as
just
make
it
more
interesting
worth
a
try
reissdorf
kolsch
poured
extremely
light
yellow
one
of
the
lightest
i
have
ever
seen
smell
was
of
sea
weed
taste
was
of
sea
salt
upfront
then
loads
and
loads
of
lemon
and
other
citrus
flavors
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
drinkability
was
very
nice
as
well
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
deal
a
very
welldone
kolsch
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
thats
pretty
average
for
this
style
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
the
best
in
a
style
that
is
already
pretty
mediocre
really
good
drinkability
a
wonderful
summertime
session
beer
overall
i
nice
brew
and
was
enjoyable
served
in
my
reissdorf
stange
poured
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
in
solution
halfinch
white
head
dissipated
into
a
threadlike
white
band
that
coalesced
around
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
clean
grassy
nose
grain
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
a
sweet
character
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
lightbodied
without
being
watery
and
mildly
effervescent
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
but
a
little
too
simple
for
my
tastes
appearance
is
clear
yelloworange
with
a
nice
offwhite
that
is
rather
restrained
but
settles
into
a
thin
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
for
the
duration
aroma
is
a
complex
mixture
of
flowery
noble
hops
and
malt
that
reminds
me
of
graham
crackers
or
crunchy
ginger
snaps
taste
is
bursting
with
that
same
yummy
malt
that
dances
nicely
with
the
noble
hops
medium
mouthfeel
also
has
a
mineraly
feel
to
it
that
leaves
a
semidry
finish
but
the
malt
and
hops
still
linger
long
enough
for
me
to
savor
these
wonderful
flavors
hop
bitterness
is
also
medium
which
put
everything
together
spells
balance
right
were
a
kolsch
should
be
with
a
restrained
abv
of
under
5
this
makes
a
great
session
brew
for
hot
summer
days
on
the
lake
or
beach
ive
enjoyed
this
brew
from
a
bottle
many
times
but
its
really
something
special
on
tap
very
refreshing
and
an
easy
drinker
nice
on
a
hot
day
a
nice
kolsch
but
not
my
favorite
has
a
pale
yellow
color
very
little
head
very
clear
of
course
aroma
is
weak
but
not
bad
at
all
very
nice
mouthfeel
light
but
not
watery
and
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
carbonation
flavor
is
also
light
and
easy
with
a
touch
of
fruit
extremely
drinkable
brew
this
is
my
first
go
at
the
kölsch
style
and
i
didnt
really
expect
much
its
pretty
mild
and
refreshing
but
certainly
not
something
i
would
say
is
a
must
try
it
was
almost
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
this
was
an
ale
in
a
blindfold
test
i
probably
would
have
thought
this
to
be
a
pils
the
beer
really
didnt
wow
me
but
in
the
end
it
was
a
pretty
refreshing
outing
one
of
the
forgotten
styles
this
would
be
fantastic
on
a
warm
day
overall
this
is
a
good
first
brew
of
the
night
very
drinkable
d
a
dry
crisp
and
clean
kolsch
with
a
fair
and
moderate
drinkability
didnt
really
leave
an
impression
though
this
is
a
very
light
golden
color
kolsch
with
a
firm
whte
head
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
is
extremely
crisp
clean
wheat
and
cereal
very
nice
the
flavor
brings
light
and
refreshing
wheat
and
rice
that
again
jumps
out
as
clean
and
crisp
real
easy
drinking
for
sure
perhaps
a
bit
too
aqueous
but
it
is
great
with
food
or
as
a
quencher
on
those
hot
summer
days
i
would
enjoy
a
little
more
body
to
this
but
it
is
still
a
nice
choice
a
good
brew
the
first
time
i
tried
this
it
was
obviously
a
tad
stale
but
this
was
clearly
a
fresh
version
i
wish
we
had
more
of
this
style
down
this
way
to
compare
and
contrast
but
until
then
this
is
as
good
a
choice
as
any
very
tasty
and
undoubtedly
smooth
this
authentic
kolsch
is
a
delight
to
drink
and
enjoy

the
taste
is

with
it
starting
off
on

the
grainy

great
sweet
aftertaste
while
the
flavors
are
fairly

its
complex
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
and
aid
heavily
in
the
drinkability
very
light
in
body
with
light
carbonation
possibly
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
perfect
for
a
long
hot
summer
day
the
aftertaste
is
dry
and
crisp
almost
wine
like
not
an
extremely
clean
finish
with
some
cereal
flavor
lingering
but
overall
an
absolutely
wonderful
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
small
head
that
vanishes
quickly
smells
a
bit
bland
with
some
strange
candy
sweetness
and
a
tad
bit
of
hops
tasted
of
grain
clovers
a
sweet
taste
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
and
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
end
it
was
somewhat
carbonated
but
not
enough
to
be
a
distraction
overall
this
was
an
excellent
kolsch
and
i
will
pick
this
up
again
for
sure
d
light
and
smooth
with
a
nice
but
mild
hop
character

drinkable

interesting

excellent
kolsch
my
first
kolsch
and
i
poured
into
a
glass
from
a
bottle
this
beer
had
a
beautiful
foamy
head
that
quickly
filled
half
the
glass
until
it
settled
down
the
color
was
a
very
light
amber
and
there
was
a
lot
of
good
carbonation
the
beer
had
a
bready
yeasty
smell
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
hops
the
taste
was
exceptional
good
malty
sweet
flavor
up
front
that
became
citrusy
almost
sour
in
the
middle
before
finishing
with
a
soft
hoppiness
this
was
a
medium
bodied
beer
and
extremely
drinkable
i
will
definitely
drink
some
more
of
these
d
easy
to
drink
great
for
summer
not
overly
complex
though
d
the
cereallike
quality
makes
it
feel
too
much
like
a
macro
which
makes
me
a
little
bored
and
little
sick
after
awhile
this
is
an
interesting
beer
overall
but
the
13
or
so
thats
so
lagerlike
really
knocks
out
the
drinkability
for
me
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
the
beer
had
a
light
gold
appearance
with
a
medium
sized
head
stay
in
appearance
pretty
much
until
it
was
gone
grassy
hops
perfumed
from
the
drink
giving
it
a
very
full
aroma
tastewise
i
felt
the
low
bitter
sweet
flavors
of
citrus
and
hops
made
this
very
clean
but
also
very
wellrounded
taste
carbonation
from
the
mouthfeel
helped
make
this
crisp
and
light
this
was
watery
in
a
good
refreshing
way
great
light
drink
to
begin
the
night
this
was
the
first
kolsch
style
beer
i
have
had
enjoyed
it
well
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
very
clear
gold
color
with
many
little
bubbles
and
a
nice
white
head
smell
a
good
mix
of
hops
and
mild
malts
taste
was
very
crisp
with
the
slightest
hint
of
mint
and
vanilla
as
well
as
fresh
hops
and
a
little
malt
a
very
good
variety
very
dry
finish
yet
still
crisp
on
the
tongue
ideal
for
a
summer
afternoons
relaxing
before
moving
onto
some
more
weighty
beers

the
beer
pours
a

with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
is
ok
aroma
is
grassy
biscuity
and
lemony
but
light
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
its
stronger
than
the
aroma
is
mouthfeelbody
is
light
with
good
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
pretty
sessionable
too
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
on
the
lighter
side
this
is
a
pretty
good
choice
d
this
is
a
nice
break
from
the
heavy
ales
ive
been
drinking
this
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
the
bmc
crowd
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
was
hard
to
put
down
and
just
kept
getting
better
as
it
came
to
temp
well
worth
the
9
99
tag
for
the
4
pack
your
nonba
buds
would
enjoy
this
one
d
off
the
charts
very
good
stuff
this
drinkability
a
solid
kolsch
and
4

quite
sessionable
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
an
inch
and
a
half
in
height
and
recedes
rather
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
with
a
moderate
grassy
spicy
hop
character
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
a
wonderful
mineral
tone
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
lively
refreshing
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
while
living
in
germany
for
nearly
four
years
i
noticed
a
distinct
mineral
character
in
the
beers
from
a
lot
of
small
local
german
breweries
i
havent
experienced
that
characteristic
much
since
moving
back
to
america
but
this
beer
has
it
i
will
certainly
drink
this
beer
again

about
as
good
as
kolsches
get
from
what
ive
had
so
far
great
easy
drinking
beer
but
nothing
crazy
drinkability
im
having
visions
of
friday
night
a
sox
game
on
tv
and
several
of
these
to
enjoy
throughout
the
evening
a
very
tasty
beer

a
thin

of

touches
of

aftertaste
was
a
good
balance
of
grain
sweetness
and
hops
restrained
carbonation
medium
bodied
with
a
very
good
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
light
and
delicate
easy
drinking
beer
well
balanced
and
executed
not
the
most
complicated
german
beer
ive
had
this
nonetheless
makes
good
company
its
straightforward
but
solid
somewhat
basic
but
refreshing
and
smooth
easy
to
enjoy
and
grab
another
to
follow
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
lighter
brew
but
there
is
enough
here
for
the
palate
to
warrant
another
bottle
or
two
damn
good
for
a
lighter
brew
cheers
a
kölsch
is
supposed
to
be
soft
around
the
edges
just
enough
of
everything
to
make
it
special
and
the
special
quality
is
damn
hard
to
achieve
for
brewers
d
not
amazing
but
definitely
pretty
decent
for
a
style
that
is
overall
uninspired
with
food
veggie
quesadillas
good
pizza
and
lighter
grilled
fare
would
fit
the
bill
perfectly
well
its
the
first
kölsch
that
i
tried
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
turn
someone
on
to
the
thrills
of
imported
beer
that
drank
miller
an
easydrinking
classic
kolsch
with
a
nice
hop
and
cedary
touch
i
liked
this
one
more
from
the
bottle
than
from
the
tap
i
had
a
few
months
ago
overall
stands
out
for
the
style
dability
not
sure
how
long
this
beer
sat
on
the
shelves
in
boulder
but
clearly
not
fresh
age
of
samples
makes
flavor
and
mf
reviews
potentially
not
representative
i
poured
out
the
last
half
of
the
500
ml
bottle
enough
said
this
beer
was
golden
straw
in
color
and
formed
a
nice
head
leaving
plenty
of
lace
on
the
way
down
the
aroma
had
just
a
hint
of
mint
and
the
taste
had
a
tuch
of
vanilla
and
a
nice
malt
flavor
with
a
dry
cedary
finish
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
that
i
could
definitly
have
more
than
one
of
especialy
on
a
hot
day
dthis
is
a
very
simple
aleat
the
same
time
it
has
a
great
quality

from
a
brown
330
ml
bottle
there
is
a
mild
grainy
aroma
the
body
is
quite
light
the
flavor
is
mostly
grainy
with
a
touch
of
noble
hops
better
than
a
macro
lager
anyday
yet
just
as
drinkable
i
should
learn
to
stop
drinking
kolschs
myself
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
from
reissdorf
us
likely
to
be
named
a
classic
for
the
style
id
likely
get
something
else
again
but
it
was
alright
pours

clear
straw
gold
with
a
white
head
that
rises
well
off

aggressive
pour
but
falls

nose
is
malty
slightly
sweet
and
overall
mild
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
grainy
tone
to
it
smooth
and
even
feel
is
good
with
a
low
carbonation
and
a
decent
mix
of
ingredients
definitely
drinkable
if
you
want
to
try
a
kolsch
for
the
first
time
this
is
a
decent
enough
one
to
do
it
with
5l
keg
at
our
septoberfest
party

yellow
color
with
noticeable
bubbles

flavors
the
finish
is
moderately
hoppy
with
a
sweet
malty
aftertaste
decent
all
around
although
i
am
not
sure
it
justifies
the
higher
price
tag
given
other
domestic
kölsch
choices
are
just
as
good
pours
a
clean
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white

that
slowly
dissipates
aroma
is
subtle
mainly
clean
malt
with
a
little
grassy

the
flavor
is
malty
leaning
toward
a
fresh
grain
flavor
with
a
high
carbonation
level
that
keep
it
all
very
clean
on
the
palate
hops
are
in
the
background
but
work
well
with
the
malt
character
of
this
lighter
weight
beer
a
very
sessionable
beer
and
worked
well
as
an
appetizer
for
a
heavy
meal
of
deutsch
pork
shank
and
spaetzle
perked
up
the
taste
buds
without
tiring
them
this
is
what
american
macro
lagers
like
budweiser
and
miller
ought
to
taste
like
light
easygoing
but
with
enough
taste
read
not
watered
down
that
it
never
gets
boring
but
it
isnt
really
that
complex
and
nothing
jumps
out
at
you
that
makes
it
special
mouthfeel
is
the
highlight
here
as
it
sits
on
the

liquid
silk
if
you
want
a
nice
smooth
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
couple
friends
while
watching
a
ballgame
reissdorf
is
your
beer
my
friend
i
wish
more
light
beer
drinkers
would
drink
more
of
this
its
a
great
style
and
this
beer
is
a
great
representation
of
it
my
first
kolsch
i
think
pours
a
pale
goldenstraw
color
into
my
weizen
glass
w
a
fluffy
white
head
which
dissapates
quickly
leaving
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
not
a
strong
smell
some
hop
aroma
w
a
slightly
vinous
fruitish
undertone
more
of
the
same
here
a
slightly
thin
flavor
crisp
w
some
hop
flavor
hard
to
define
the
malt
flavor
its
too
weak
some
fruitiness
comes
through
as
well
but
too
covered
up
by
the
hops
to
identify
a
dry
lightbodied
beer
almost
too
thin
though
its
borderline
3
54
on
the
ba
scale
its
quite
quaffable
though
w
its
dryness
a
4
8
abv
i
could
drink
a
gallon
of
it
drinkability
not
nearly
as
drinkable
as
the
beers
i
sampled
in
koln
it
is
apparent
there
has
been
some
damage
done
in
transport
but
i
tend
to
hold
import
to
the
high
standard
of
consuming
them
in
the
country
of
origin
overall
i
was
very
nicely
surprised
by
this
one
now
i
shouldnt
be
because
i
love
the
style
however
it
is
always
nice
when
i
get
one
i
never
heard
of
and
it
turns
out
well
for
me
i
was
definatly
interested
and
would
really
love
to
have
this
one
again
with
the
weather
finally
turning
cooler
it
will
be
a
challenge
to
enjoy
these
light
summer
brews
much
longer
but
i
will
still
pick
this
one
up
again
definitely
recommend
for
sure
drinkability
goes
down
easy
but
no
real
flavor
that
stays
in
the
mouth
to
make
it
memorable
very
clean
straw
color
with
thin
head
that
quickly
disappears
mild
citrus
smell
that
is
not
overpowering
but
noticable
i
was
taken
back
that
a
beer
this
clear
could
have
hop
flavor
like
that
it
is
not
a
potent
as
an
ipa
but
it
lets
your
palate
know
its
there
under
the
hops
is
a
good
white
wine
grape
taste
that
is
very
dry
but
welcome
this
beer
is
very
carbonated
much
like
a
white
wine
and
pops
across
your
tounge
a
very
good
kolsch
keeping
germany
proud
d
a
highly
drinkable
beer
flavourful
well
balanced
and
a
lowish
abv
make
this
a
pretty
good
session
beer
drinkability
when
the
mood
is
right
like
a
gross
muggy
day
in
georgia
this
beer
is
a
life
saver
thin
light
mouthfeel
and
a
highly
drinkable
beer
a
decent
summer
beer
but
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
grab
at
with
this
one
for
a
first
time
kolsch
this
one
comes
off
as
a
wit
and
pilsner
hybrid
to
explain
the
style
to
someone
who
hasnt
tried
it
im
told
this
is
what
a
kölsch
is
supposed
to
be
and
i
cant
really
complain
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
soapy
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
small
cap
the
smell
is
slightly
grassy
and
some
hints
of
fruity
esters
the
brew
has
a
biscuitlike
malt
base
with
haygrassy
hops
slightly
metallic
copper
the
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
slightly
dry
slighly
bitter
well
carbonated
a
fine
lighter
style
brew
that
is
satisfying
a
great
beer
to
try
before
the
summer
ends
crisp
and
clean
a
little
dry
a
perfect
choice
for
refreshment
really
easy
to
drink
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
looks
clearer
than
what
i
expect
from
the
kolsch
style
thats
just
my
opinion
though
the
head
didnt
last
long
at
all
it
has
a
nice
light
hop
aroma
the
typical
german
crisp
smell
at
this
point
before
my
first
sip
i
feel
as
if
this
beer
seems
more
like
a
pilsner
than
a
kolsch
but
the
taste
did
bring
the
clean
wheaty
taste
i
expect
very
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
kolsch
i
must
say
that
i
expect
a
bit
more
cloudiness
and
a
bit
more
body
maybe
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
flavors
however
its
still
a
nice
refreshing
summer
time
beer
and
next
time
im
walking
off
the
sand
vball
court
itll
be
nice
to
have
one
of
these
for
those
of
you
who
might
think
that
bud
miller
or
heinekin
is
a
flavorful
beer
as
a
first
step
try
a
kolsch
like
this
one
the
improvement
may
astound
you
this
is
not
however
my
favorite
kolsch
drinkability
was
quite
impressive
for
a
lighterstyled
summertime
beer
this
was
both
quaffable
and
fairly
flavorful
tthis
is
a
high
quality
beer
i
find
myself
really
loving
a
good
kolsch
on
a
hot
summer
day
as
somewhat
of
a
seasonal
drinker
this
one
is
always
welcome
during
the
dog
days
drinkability
very
nice
beer
the
overall
taste
is
that
of
a
pilsner
but
with
the
complex
overtones
of
an
ale
drinkability
i
was
quite
surprised
with
the
complexity
of
this
brew
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
quite
as
refreshing
as
it
was
it
is
a
beer
for
a
refined
pallet
you
couldnt
just
stop
with
one
poured
a
pale
golden
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
ring
some
spotty
lacing
the
smell
is
light
sweet
and
grainy
the
taste
is
relatively
crisp
very
slightly
sweet
and
with
bready
malt
quite
rounded
in
flavor
refreshing
and
fairly
light
in
both
body
and
abv
could
be
a
little
crisper
but
a
nice
summer
beer
nevertheless
very
clean
as
well
11707
recently
had
this
on
draft
at
a
local
restaurant
would
only
add
that
the
beer
looked
great
in
a
stange
d
it
goes
down
all
right
if
they
all
tasted
like
this
id
probably
be
sick
of
reissdorf
after
two
or
three
hopefully
i
can
go
and
live
in
cologne
one
day
and
give
this
ale
a
more
thorough
review
there
pours
a
crystalclear
light
gold
with
a
billowing
white
head
that
reduces
fairly
quickly
leaving
behind
little
lacing
tremendous
bubble
activity
perhaps
the
clearest
cleanestlooking
beer
ive
ever
seen
the
bouquet
is
primarily
bready
doughy
vaguely
fruity
malts
the
taste
is
as
clean
as
the
appearance
exceptionally
smooth
with
a
yeasty
but
fruity
and
tart
flavor
that
gives
way
to
a
dry
subtly
hoppy
finish
very
lightbodied
with
a
crisp
spritzy
mouthfeel
its
lightness
and
relatively
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
beer
you
spend
an
entire
afternoon
with
the
hotter
the
day
the
better
amazingly
refreshing
it
also
seems
to
be
crafted
with
utter
discipline
and
precision
very
characteristic
of
its
german
origin
for
better
in
the
case
of
beer
cars
and
electronics
or
for
worse
i
wont
go
any
further
reissdorf
kolsch
is
an
excellent
although
not
quite
perfect
fruh
kolsch
example
of
a
kolsch
for
those
of
you
who
like
lighter
but
flavorful
beers
this
is
the
style
for
you
can
be
consumed
ice
cold
like
many
americans
drink
their
beer
but
is
better
around
50
degrees

very
clear
and
smooth

excellent
summer
beer
if
you
live
somewhere
hot
like
me
no
distinguishable
aftertaste
and
moderate

content

little
head
retention
and
not
much
lace
overall
i
would
buy
this
beer
over
and
over
and
of
course
drink
it
too
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
clean
grainy
malt
and
some
slightly
spicey

the
taste
is

of
the
grainy
malt
and
slightly
metallic
with
a
mildly
spicy
hop
finish
overall
this
is
just
an
average
beer
that
doesnt
possess
any
qualities
that
make
me
want
to
have
another
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
sparkling
light
clean
as
the
color
indicated
it
might
bejust
a
hint
heavier
but
it
was
more
satisfying
for
it
still
so
easy
to
drink

d
yep
ill
have
another
i
would
think
the
fresher
this
is
the
more
the
experience
would
improve
im
gonna
think
that
this
would
be
an
excellent
choice
for
a
lawnmower
or
after
a
long
motorcyclerideatdusk
kind
of
beer
recommended
very
drinkable
seems
a
great
brew
to
make
a
summertime
session
of
its
a
cool
spring
night
and
its
fine
now
i
could
see
this
on
a
summer
day
in
koln
with
the
steeples
of
the
ancient
cathedral
in
the
background
quaffing
away
without
a
care
in
the
world
but
im
not
in
koln
and
its
3
a
bottle
and
well
pbr
is
not
if
you
like
the
fact
that
you
are
drinking
a
german
beer
then
by
all
means
enjoy
but
i
think
for
what
it
is
there
are
a
lot
of
beers
that
are
similar
and
as
drinkable
very
easy
to
drink
great
german
session
beer
the
only
true
kolsch
generally
available
in
the
middle
west
the
aroma
is
of
bread
and
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
biscuity
and
refreshing
with
the
floral
and
grassy
hop
notes
present
enough
for
a
good
taste
but
well
balanced
by
the
malt
character
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
dry
very
refreshing
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
in
fact
i
have
500ml
bottle
pale
golden
ale
small
white
head
that
went
fast
slow
carbonation
honeyish
aroma
sweet
and
malty
buiscuitysome
small
grassy
hop
sweet
and
malty
at
the
start
then
dries
out
real
fast
leaving
a
small
bitter
after
taste
lager
like
consistency
on
the
palate
but
very
dry
and
a
fast
finish
a
beer
for
hot
weather
nightly
session
simple
stuff
but
drinkable
d
a
pretty
good
kolsch
it
isnt
incredibly
flavorful
but
it
tastes
good
bit
of
cheesy
aroma
greets
you
on
a
pale
yellow
lager
with
moderate
head
fair
taste
a
tad
sweet
and
dry
but
satisfying
smooth
somewhat
creamy
and
drying
mouthfeel
i
have
had
much
creamier
kolsch
and
want
something
hoppier
as
well
at
4
8
a
session
ale
and
a
good
summer
lawnmower
choice
bham
uk
i
wish
this
were
available
on
draught
nearby
as
it
is
really
a
quality
session
beer
poured
out
a
light
yellow
crystal
clear
body
with
a
nice
bone
white
head
the
nose
is
clean
with
faint
dry
and
slightly
sweet
pale
malt
note
lots
of
fresh
grain
here
the
taste
is
hard
to
describe
unless
youve
had
kolsch
its
likefresh
grain
and
stale
grain
mashed
together
with
some
fruityness
and
some
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
bright
fresh
and
crisp
very
drinkable
light
bodied
and
pretty
dang
drinkable
more
suitable
for
summer
but
good
enough
whenever
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
tried
a
kolsch
style
of
beer
and
i
loved
it
it
first
smell
to
me
a
little
like
bread
and
the
beer
was
filled
with
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
the
taste
was
great
and
tasted
a
little
nutty
and
sweet
great
beer
and
im
sure
i
will
have
it
again
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
though
nothing
remarkable
worth
a
try
drinkability
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
i
love
this
freaking
beer
opinion
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
must
be
a
pretty
darn
fresh
example
as
this
is
the
best
example
of
this
beer
that
i
have
had
as
the
beer
warms
you
realize
how
complex
it
is
and
to
come
across
this
balanced
and
refreshing
is
an
achievement
this
is
a
hard
style
to
make
and
this
is
a
great
example
i
will
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
and
i
can
only
hope
that
it
is
as
fresh
as
this
one
is
this
is
a
good
kolsch
from
one
of
the
authentic
kolsch
breweries
so
it
really
should
define
the
style
however
i
cant
help
but
really
appreciate
what
american
brewers
have
done
and
how
theyve
seemed
to
improved
upon
the
original
character
of
this
german
style
not
much
to
write
home
about
with
this
beer
maybe
okay
for
a
session
beer
but
too
expensive
in
the
us
for
that
the
drinkability
is
good
very
refreshing
prosit
mk
wavz
pours
a
brilliant
light
gold
with
a
white
head
that
settles
quickly
a
biscuity
malt
aroma
with
a
faint
fruitiness
taste
of
delicate
malt
with
a
subtle
fruity
ester
and
a
dry
almost
metallic
finish
thin
and
drinkable
true
to
style
a
good
session
beer
with
more
interest
than
most
the
appearance
is
rich
yellow
with
a
slight
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
it
is
exactly
what
one
would
expect
for
this
style
the
smell
is
more
complex
than
one
might
expect
however
it
is
filled
with
subtle
tones
of
herbs
cheap
chardonnay
fruit
and
medicine
its
taste
is
not
much
different
but
that
is
not
such
a
bad
thing
it
is
a
refreshing
drink
you
could
drink
several
of
them
on
a
warm
day
it
reminds
me
of
most
american
beer
it
is
clean
refreshing
watery
and
very
drinkable
the
only
problem
i
have
is
that
it
has
an
odd
taste
of
mold
buried
in
the
mix
that
i
find
obviously
objectionable
i
would
drink
another
though
if
it
presented
itself
drinkability
this
is
decent
but
not
great
this
holds
down
drinkability
for
me
the
body
is
very
light
like
drinking
a
carbonated
water
the
taste
is
very
clean
washing
the
flavors
away
quickly
quite
a
drinkable
beer
for
those
who
can
truly
appreciate
subtlety
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
frothy
white
head
that
fades
away
to
nothing
pretty
quickly
smells
slightly
of
yeast
and
not
much
else
tastes
very
light
but
balanced
a
little
sweet
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamy
and
a
little
fizzy
very
true
to
style
and
very
drinkable
drinkablity
a
very
drinkable
ale
nice
and
refreshing
interesting
aroma
and
flavors
pleasant
complexity
pours
from
the
bottle
to
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
some
carbonation
and
a
little
white
head
that
floats
on
top
but
no
lacing
although
this
looks
like
a
bmc
pour
it
actually
has
an
aroma
of
faint
nuts
and
honey
and
a
tasty
flavor
that
ends
with
a
smooth
finish
this
was
not
a
great
beer
but
actually
was
not
too
bad
and
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
when
i
recently
visited
the
köln
area
i
took
the
opportunity
to
try
and
sample
as
many
varieties
of
kölsch
that
i
could
find
reissdorf
ranks
1
on
ba
so
my
expectations
were
high
i
opened
the
bottle
and
it
poured
with
a
nice
straw
yellow
color
and
a
finger
of
foam
the
smell
was
not
so
pronounced
but
i
could
sense
the
hops
some
dishrags
and
citrus
the
taste
like
in
some
other
kinds
of
kölsch
was
bitter
and
sour
followed
by
bread
and
some
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
i
could
make
out
some
herbs
as
well
the
bottled
reissdorf
does
not
measure
up
to
the
draught
version
personally
i
rank
gaffel
a
little
higher
enjoy
the
taste
and
finding
flavors
here
is
what
this
beer
is
about
i
have
to
admit
that
i
prefer
ales
over
lagers
however
if
this
beer
is
any
indication
kolsches
are
almost
alelike
in
their
flavor
profiles
this
beer
was
on
tap
at
barley
johns
in
new
brighton
mn
poured
into
glassware
from
the
reissdorf
brewery
the
color
was
a
clear
dark
yellow
with
a
minimal
head
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
there
is
a
faintly
grassy
smell
the
taste
is
soft
and
creamy
with
a
pleasant
fruitiness
and
an
assertive
grassiness
the
creamy
texture
imparts
a
nice
richness
to
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
perfect
light
summer
thirst
quencher
very
well
done
i
used
to
think
this
style
was
too
light
and
bland
to
be
interesting
but
now
i
can
own
up
i
like
kolsch
and
i
dont
care
who
knows
it
nice
mouthfeel
touch
of
grainy
cloyingness
mildly
refreshing
very
fresh
and
light
beer
with
a
crisp
finish
and
some
light
but
interesting
fermentation
flavours
the
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
crisp
and
refreshing
some
flavors
of
grain
come
through
with
hints
of
light
fruits
like
pear
the
finish
has
just
a
touch
of
hop
presence
pleasantly
dry
and
unassuming
extremely
drinkable
and
very
thirst
quenching
on
this
hot
august
afternoon
d
this
is
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
it
has
good
dry
malt
flavors
that
stand
out
even
though
they
are
pale
malts
with
that
distinctive
kolsch
flavor
that
so
few
beers
have
d
a
good
beer
that
id
love
to
drink
again
notes
this
was
my
first
kolsch
and
i
will
be
tring
more
but
take
that
into
consideration
when
reading
my
review
notes
a
refresher
on
a
hot
day
but
dont
know
if
id
go
back
to
it
that
often
not
enough
punch
for
me

the
gold
standard
for
the
style

it
just
doesnt
get

so
drinkable
that
i
cant
tell
that
im
drinking
it
if
that
makes
sense
the
glass
is
empty
full
and
empty
again
before
i
even
notice
refreshing
and
perfect
very
drinkable
refreshing
cleansing
i
know
little
about
this
style
but
from
what
i
can
tell
this
one
hits
all
the
right
notes
in
at
least
an
adequate
if
not
impressive
fashion
and
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
undeniable
i
hope
this
is
still
on
sale
next
week
when
ill
have
my
next
chance
to
snap
up
a
few
more
d
very
very
drinkable
perfect
on
a
hot
day
and
so
refreshing
it
hurts
excellent
drinkabilty
i
drank
mine
ice
cold
and
in
a
a
pilsner
glass
excellent
taste
is
also
somewhat
nutty
in
fact
its
odd
i
mean
i
expected
not
sure
why
some
sort
of
fruity
characters
at
least
a
hint
based
on
the
appearance
but
theres
nothing
i
mean
its
the
slightest
bit
hoppy
and
slightly
beernutzy
flavoured
but
its
more
watery
than
anything
else
i
have
to
say
im
disappointed
this
is
dull
and
flavourless
didnt
much
care
for
this
one
by
all
accounts
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
it
was
my
first
kolsch
so
maybe
im
just
need
to
know
what
to
expect
think
ill
try
it
again
in
a
few
years
the
beer
came
in
a
11
2
oz
longneck
brown
bottle
when
poured
out
looked
pretty
similar
to
a
pilsner
with
a
pale
yellow
clear
body
and
a
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
was
clean
and
lemony
and
didnt
have
much
else
going
on
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
complicated
that
a
pilsner
with
delicate
sourness
being
the
primary
taste
followed
by
a
hint
of
lemon
rind
and
a
subtle
fruity
sweetness
the
body
was
thin
but
the
beer
was
as
refreshing
as
they
get
if
i
understand
the
style
correctly
this
beer
is
right
on
the
delicate
flavors
are
beautifully
done
with
the
malt
shining
brightly
i
really
like
this
beer
and
this
style
i
need
to
try
more
kolsch
500ml
bottle
super
drinkable
a
very
good
example
of
style
that
isnt
a
favorite
but
sure
hits
the
spot
on
a
warm
day
big
beer
addicts
may
not
like
but
that
would
be
their
loss
im
being
a
bit
conservative
in
my
ratings
despite
my
current
opinion
that
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
and
would
definitely
session
it
on
tap
at
maduro
in
madison
wi
pale
straw
color
thin
white
head
aromas
of
englsih
muffins
and
straw
slight
fruitiness
pears
and
apples
i
think
in
the
flavor
plenty
of
bisquits
and
just
a
touch
of
spice
very
mild
and
mellow
easily
downable
wonderfully
refreshing
cant
wait
to
sit
on
the
patio
at
maduro
and
drink
this
come
july
would
make
an
excellent
aperitif
it
seems
to
clean
and
awaken
the
palate
d
this
is
an
excelent
kolsch
that
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
imagine
that
this
could
turn
into
one
of
my
favorite
porch
beers
this
summer
it
is
rare
to
find
an
actual
kölsch
from
köln
at
least
in
these
parts
this
one
is
the
only
example
ive
found
as
far
as
i
can
tell
reissdorf
kölsch
is
a
benchmark
of
the
style
and
if
you
like
light
refreshing
flavorful
lager
like
ale
or
if
youd
like
to
see
what
the
american
micros
are
trying
to
copy
pick
up
some
reissdorf
they
brew
one
thing
and
they
brew
it
well
from
the
500ml
bottle
poured
a
yellow
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
left
no
lacing
aroma
a
mild
yeast
and
malt
aroma
with
some
sour
citrus
and
a
hint
of
skunk
but
not
bad
flavor
sweet
malt
and
hops
a
slight
bitterness
and
the
good
thing
no
skunk
this
was
a
very
easy
to
drink
before
i
knew
it
it
was
gone
a
good
choice
as
a
macro
alternative
understandable
why
this
kolsch
ranks
amoung
bas
top
beers
a
great
granny
smith
apple
with
lemonlime
citrus
characters
in
the
nose
and
flavors
lightly
malty
and
lightly
grainy
but
not
to
distract
moderately
bready
and
yeasty
a
light
but
round
and
complete
body
a
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
bleached
white
lessthanfizzy
head
lightly
minty
in
the
finish
very
clean
and
refreshing
hard
to
find
a
better
summertime
beer
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
this
is
a
pretty
good
kolsch
and
would
pick
it
up
again
arrived
a
crystalclear
golden
yellow
with
moderate
creamy
head
and
no
lace
smells
grainy
hoppy
faintly
minty
and
honeylike
nice
but
restrained
flavors
dominated
by
grainy
malt
and
hops
and
balanced
with
honey
sweetness
and
slight
mint
notes
big
carbonated
and
quenching
lightness
in
the
mouth
an
easy
drinking
and
a
pleasant
way
to
start
an
evening
have
it
before
your
other
selections
since
they
will
completely
overwhelm
the
delicate
lightness
of
this
beer
drinkability
relatively
dry
with
a
clean
palate
yet
a
bit
more
substantial
and
smooth
than
a
standard
pils
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
d
okay
good
for
both
food
pairings
and
sessioning
however
it
is
a
mediocre
beer
at
best
i
am
not
a
huge
koelsch
fan
but
this
has
little
to
no
character
first
of
all
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
light
flavorful
and
worth
a
try
too
bad
all
kolschs
arent
as
clean
and
well
rounded
as
this
one
i
could
session
this
for
the
right
price
ill
drink
it
in
germany
pours
a
pale
gold
color
crystal
clear
and
moderate
head
bready
smell
with
slight
hop
notes
this
brew
has
a
light
crisp
taste
that
is
very
dry
all
the
way
through
sweet
malts
dominate
flavor
with
dry
floral
hops
rounding
out
the
end
this
is
a
decent
kolsch
but
ive
had
better
and
strangely
enough
from
an
american
brewery
indian
river
a
solid
warm
weather
brew
nothing
id
really
hunt
down
again
i
prefer
good
islands
take
personally
but
certainly
still
a
good
beer
having
said
that
this
isnt
a
challenging
beer
either
while
there
is
nothing
not
to
like
about
this
beer
many
people
might
not
find
something
to
like
either
so
if
you
want
to
go
out
with
some
buddies
and
just
knock
back
a
few
this
is
the
beer
for
it
if
you
want
to
sit
back
and
appreciate
something
complex
get
something
else
this
is
a
beer
that
would
fit
in
just
fine
as
a
warm
weather
session
beer
not
sure
on
the
age
of
this
one
as
its
come
a
long
way
but
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
easily
drinkable
as
it
is
taste
light
sweet
grains
grasses
and
malt
hit
the
tip
of
the
tongue
immediately
the
beer
quickly
dried
out
with
the
flavors
of
husky
grains
and
spicy
hops
and
yeast
some
honeylike
sweetness
came
back
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
pretty
solid
kolsch
id
have
another
no
prob
and
is
quite
an
easy
drinker
and
very
sessionable
if
need
be
better
for
those
warmer
days
but
works
any
ol
time
too
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
34
offwhite
head
above
the
golden
brew
head
fades
at
a
reasonable
pace
with
sticky
average
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
of
pale
malt
and
fruity
hops
but
fleeting
taste
is
upfront
with
quick
sweetness
then
giving
way
to
somewhat
characterless
hops
bitterness
but
still
reasonably
balanced
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
above
average
and
drinkability
is
as
well
although
most
representatives
of
the
style
are
nicely
drinkable
too
this
one
just
left
me
wanting
a
bit
more
but
nothing
detrimental
in
this
bottle
looking
forward
to
some
local
american
versions
as
the
summer
winds
down
pours
a
bright
golden
straw
crystal
clear
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
that
settles
slowly
to
a
small
cap
smell
is
a
subtle
floral
hop
scent
over
a
slightly
earthy
pale
malt
taste
definitely
leans
towards
the
sweet
malts
with
a
strong
earthy
and
slightly
nutty
flavor
coming
through
as
the
beer
warmed
up
a
little
and
a
very
delicate
floral
hop
finish
very
clean
and
dry
with
almost
no
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
nice
kölsch
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
interested
but
simple
enough
to
be
a
nice
refreshing
session
beer
nice
easy
drinking
beer
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
ive
had
a
couple
of
other
kolschs
but
this
is
the
best
example
ive
tried
so
far
i
cant
believe
reissdorf
kolsch
is
anywhere
near
the
gold
standard
for
the
kolsch
style
but
its
a
drinkable
little
thirst
quencher
that
makes
no
missteps
on
its
journey
from
bottle
to
glass
to
mouth
to
points
beyond
enjoyable
this
is
not
an
especially
flavorful
beer
the
taste
is
blasé
and
nondescript
with
no
lace
and
no
real
character
just
a
drab
grainy
puddle
of
yellow
stuff
with
bubbles
at
best
its
inoffensive
but
overall
a
letdown
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
smooth
bubbles
throughout
overall
a
drinkable
beer
easy
and
light
but
that
aftertaste
just
kills
something
for
me
clean
classic
german
ale
in
a
word
subtle
and
quaffable
oh
crap
that
was
3
wasnt
it
oh
well
you
get
the
point
golden
color
like
a
lager
which
scared
me
a
bit
at
first
but
the
mildly
hoppy
woodsy
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
intrigued
me
this
kolsch
ale
has
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
a
smooth
laid
back
taste
its
not
a
fullflavor
fullbodied
beer
but
it
held
my
interest
much
longer
than
a
lager
would
surprisingly
refreshing
though
perfect
for
a
hot
dry
afternoon
or
evening
serve
on
the
colder
side
not
an
ale
to
be
had
at
cellar
temps
served
in
the
classic
tall
cylinder
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
that
i
believe
the
germans
refer
to
as
a
cartridge
a
very
light
blonde
kolsch
that
is
rather
dry
with
mineralish
notes
hidden
among
toasted
malt
and
slightly
spicy
hops
not
much
an
aroma
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
subtle
complexity
it
took
a
great
effort
to
let
his
beer
warm
up
a
bit
too
notice
its
personality
i
really
liked
sort
of
slightly
slatelike
mineral
component
in
this
beer
the
taste
is
nice
round
bready
malt
hand
in
hand
with
mildly
bitter
hops
from
start
to
drying
finish
smooth
and
balanced
with
a
sturdy
and
persistent
carbonation
wonderfully
drinkable
crisp
and
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
light
bodied
but
not
at
all
watery
very
nice
to
cool
off
while
grilling
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
500
ml
bottle
at
the
foreign
beer
bar
of
the
32nd
cambridge
beer
festival
was
also
available
on
draught
there
but
not
when
i
decided
to
sample
it
this
was
my
first
kölsch
ever
as
far
as
i
can
remember
moderate
head
yellow
colour
looks
like
a
pilsener
or
a
helles
smells
like
a
decent
pilsener
grass
hints
of
tropical
fruits
flavour
nearly
like
a
decent
helles
or
one
of
the
better
pale
lagers
but
a
slight
yeastiness
betrays
its
origin
decent
but
did
not
impress
me
i
drank
this
beer
on
one
of
the
first
hot
days
of
the
year
and
it
was
very
refreshing
it
poured
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
it
actually
looked
a
lot
like
most
macro
beers
the
smell
was
nothing
that
special
i
could
pick
up
a
slight
malt
aroma
and
a
very
small
hint
of
lemon
the
taste
was
very
clean
without
tremendous
amount
of
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
the
carbonation
was
nice
making
this
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
a
definite
step
up
from
an
adjunct
lager
lawnmower
beer
but
i
prefer
styles
with
a
little
more
backbone
also
i
enjoyed
this
beer
most
when
it
was
good
and
cold
around
40
degrees
overall
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
easy
drinking
flavor
is
nice
and
subtle
and
there
are
no
off
flavors
in
this
one
not
really
much
else
to
say
about
it
its
a
kolsch
light
in
the
mouthfeel
but
that
adds
to
the
delicate
nature
of
this
brew
the
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
scores
best
the
bite
from
the
hops
is
quick
and
clean
which
makes
it
a
good
beer
to
wash
down
dinner
that
quick
bite
is
good
for
clearing
the
palate
between
bites
im
starting
to
like
kolsch
a
lot
more
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
definitely
a
nice
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
brew
that
requires
a
more
careful
examination
to
identify
subtle
flavors
and
fragrances
nothing
except
the
appearance
profile
jumps
out
as
obvious
or
easy
to
characterize
note
the
ba
with
whom
i
traded
for
this
beer
was
kind
enough
to
include
the
proper
glass
in
the
trade
and
i
believe
it
made
a
difference
in
how
this
beer
came
across
dense
bright
white
head
barely
hazy
pale
straw
colored
beer
faint
aroma
is
a
bit
grainy
and
barely
sweet
slightly
sweet
grainy
malt
flavor
and
a
pinch
of
lemon
up
front
hops
provide
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
mild
sweetness
from
the
malt
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
my
first
good
example
of
the
style
this
reissdorf
is
interesting
because
i
had
another
one
of
these
that
was
much
better
and
much
more
kolsch
like
interesting
theres
nothing
remarkable
or
exciting
here
but
its
a
clean
simple
beer
that
i
enjoyed
with
a
turkey
sub
i
have
a
feeling
that
im
missing
the
kolsch
boat
here
until
i
try
more
within
the
style
gorgeous
golden
color
in
the
collins
glass
plenty
of
bubbles
and
a
large
rocky
head
dominate
the
view
nice
crisp
sweet
odor
the
taste
started
clean
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
then
a
balance
of
hops
hit
without
destroying
the
malt
goodness
the
finish
was
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
as
expected
for
the
style
an
exceptionally
easy
quaff
when
i
can
find
it
ill
have
some
on
hand
as
an
excellent
alternative
to
the
big
or
hoppy
beers
refreshing
and
tasty
pours
a
hazy
bright
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
bready
apple
aromas
apple
pear
lemon
and
cracker
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
carbonated
mouthfeel
finishes
clean
this
may
be
the
best
of
this
style
i
have
ever
tried
very
drinkable
nice
16
9
oz
bottle
to
perfectly
fill
my
grolsch
glassware
it
poured
with
a
well
formed
well
sized
and
cloudy
head
the
body
is
very
clear
and
very
light
golden
the
nose
can
best
be
described
as
fresh
and
certainly
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clear
cut
a
refreshing
edge
there
is
a
big
juicy
malt
taste
that
gives
you
just
enough
of
a
grainy
side
to
improve
the
texture
the
finish
brings
a
little
more
balance
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
that
was
lacking
in
the
body
to
please
the
palate
finally
the
final
essence
remaining
in
the
mouth
is
a
pleasant
floral
bouquet
a
solid
kolsch
light
and
clear
yellow
appearance
less
than
gold
but
bright
on
a
sunny
afternoon
nice
head
lasts
at
12
an
inch
for
a
good
amount
of
time
ample
but
simple
laces
bracing
aroma
ciderlike
in
apples
and
lessthanripe
pears
light
body
carbonation
is
crisp
but
not
getting
excessive
flavor
is
nice
dry
as
baking
powder
biscuits
before
the
butter
crackerlike
and
featuring
cutting
hop
aridity
if
the
hops
were
more
pointedly
sharp
this
brew
would
be
almost
pilsnerlike
finishes
with
a
snap
and
a
message
something
like
this
beer
just
balanced
itself
try
it
again
and
see
really
drinkable
overall
my
first
german
kolsch
this
is
definitely
a
work
of
art
this
brew
is
a
somewhat
hazy
palergold
color
nice
big
bubbly
white
head
on
the
top
some
lace
trails
light
sweet
malt
nose
some
lemon
elements
taste
is
nice
sweet
malt
front
some
fruitiness
to
the
beer
hops
light
as
to
be
expected
but
not
completely
silent
pretty
crisp
mouth
i
like
this
style
a
nice
light
refreshing
brew
this
is
a
good
one
the
price
was
right
on
this
beer
so
it
came
home
with
me
tonight
it
pours
a
nice
brilliant
yellow
color
with
slight
golden
hues
and
a
nice
billowing
3
finger
head
that
seens
to
want
to
stay
around
the
nose
is
nicely
balanced
between
some
noble
german
hops
saaz
or
hallertau
not
sure
which
and
a
clean
sweet
malt
slightly
honeylike
but
not
overwhelming
the
flavor
is
not
bad
either
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
that
quickly
moves
to
a
grainey
but
not
harsh
flavor
the
hop
is
light
on
the
finsih
but
it
is
fitting
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
this
one
is
nice
and
refreshing
with
a
moderate
body
and
lively
carbonation
overall
a
very
fine
beer
its
not
a
style
i
have
often
but
one
i
may
visit
more
often
after
this
one
i
have
been
waiting
to
get
my
hands
on
some
kolsch
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
with
a
extremely
refreshing
taste
the
body
is
almost
ciderlooking
with
a
sticky
head
that
left
nice
lacing
down
my
glass
the
aroma
some
dry
rottingfruit
hints
that
may
sound
bad
but
it
blends
nicely
with
the
hop
aroma
i
would
like
to
know
what
hops
are
used
in
kolsch
to
use
in
a
homebrew
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
offbalance
there
is
a
medicine
aftertaste
accompanied
by
a
dry
rough
finish
i
dont
see
this
a
medalwinning
beer
but
it
is
definately
an
interesting
take
on
a
german
ale
my
review
cant
do
this
beer
justice
its
great
stuff
appropriately
light
this
would
be
best
suited
as
something
to
have
a
pint
or
3
of
with
dinner
tasty
and
refreshing
without
demanding
much
attention
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
from
american
hopbomb
ipas
and
maltmonster
stouts
this
will
go
great
with
simple
dishes
liked
grilled
chicken
shrimp
or
soups
i
know
many
people
think
of
kolsch
as
a
summer
type
beer
but
this
one
is
wonderful
year
around
a
winner
here
folks
tasty
is
another
one
too
i
wouldnt
mind
sucking
down
a
dozen
of
these
200
mils
at
a
time
a
newfound
joy
in
a
newfound
style

try
to
repoduce
the

smell
is
of
a

friut
and
not
much
of
hops
it
is
a
clean
crisp

taste
is
the
same
a
bit
of
gain
but
more
just
of
smooth
true
beer
with
a
bit
of
drying
hops
at
the
end
bretty
bubbly
and
carbonated
but
if
one
is
looking
for

this

i
normally
favor

drinkable
and
a
nice
arizona
summer
beer
i
havent
had
a
german
brew
in
a
while
and
im
beginning
to
think
the
1516
bavarian
law
has
boxed
them
into
making
beers
just
to
style
but
with
no
inspiration
there
was
nothing
at
all
special
about
this
beer
it
wasnt
that
it
was
bad
it
just
was
not
bad
but
a
little
too
one
dimensional
this
is
not
the
first
example
of
the
style
i
would
grab
sampled
in
a
germanamerican
restaurant
with
some
good
authentic
german
food
so
im
sure
this
favorably
colored
my
perception
of
the
beer
poured
a
bright
slightly
hazy
golden
aroma
was

on

a
little
toward
sweetness
with
some
wellrefined
grain
notes
very
clean
yet
no
dryness
not
particularly
distinctive
on
its
own
but
then
this
style
is
pretty
lowkey

and
lemony
hops
on

a

picked
up
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is

taste
is

hoppy
lemon
and
fresh
mown
hay
the
malt
is
soft
and
understated
but
provides
good
balance
a
decent
kolsch
overall
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
nicely
drinkable
from
the
bottle
pours
a
bright
golden
clear
liquid
with
a
white
foamy
head
the
head
stayed
for
a
long
time
and
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
was
slightly
floral
and
somewhat
skunky
almost
stale
taste
was
pretty
sewwt
in
the
front
followed
by
a
dryness
with
a
modest
amount
of
hop
bitterness
it
had
a
slightly
floral
finish
but
was
also
slightly
sour
light
body
and
high
carbonation
overall
i
think
i
may
have
an
old
bottle
i
have
had
this
before
from
the
tap
and
when
it
was
fresher
it
was
quite
good
i
would
be
willing
to
try
again
with
a
fresher
sample
because
i
can
see
this
would
be
good
and
refreshing
poured
out
a
straw
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
smell
consisted
of
malt
mostly
mixed
in
with
some
grass
aroma
and
some
wheatgrain
blended
in
with
some
fruit
taste
was
very
clean
grain
and
wheat
hit
the
palate
gently
along
with
some
malts
gets
slighty
sweet
towards
the
end
really
good
brew
towards
the
summer
months
some
citrusy
hop
persistence
in
the
background
but
the
flavor
profile
is
mostly
crisp
pale
malt
lightly
fruity
and
grassy
some
fizz
and
just
a
hint
of
skunk
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
very
easy
to
drink
know
what
this
tastes
like
ballantine
xxx
i
thought
this
was
my
first
foray
into
kolsch
but
it
is
just
like
ballantine
one
of
my
favorite
cheap
standbys
think
ill
stick
with
a
sixer
of
ballantine
cans
this
doesnt
show
me
much
else
to
warrant
import
prices
maybe
ill
save
kolsch
for
a
future
trip
to
cologne
drinkability
easy
enough
going
down
not
spectacular
but
a
genuinely
drinkable
quality
beer
overall
in
general
i
prefer
sweeter
darker
thicker
beers
than
this
so
its
hard
for
me
to
rate
this
beer
objectively
but
it
was
a
good
change
of
pace
and
i
enjoyed
the
tantalizing
hints
of
sugary
sweetness
at
the
beginning
certainly
a
good
refreshing
summer
beer
pale
golden
yellow
in
color
nice
carbonation
level
and

aroma
of
malt
and
slight
hopiness
nice

linger
however
somewhat
soft
malt
in
the
backround
relatively
smooth
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
pleasant
all
around
nice
beergreat
for
a
warm
summers
day
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
and
the
malt
lasts
on
the
tongue
for
a
bit
after
swallowing
lighter
bodied
and
refreshing
extremely
drinkable
i
like
the
balance
smoothness
and
the
overall
drinkability
a
guy
needs
a
nice
summer
ale
and
this
one
will
do
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
isnt
my
style
of
beer
but
i
liked
this
one
so
pale
in
color
i
can
see
my
entire
hand
with
great
clarity
as
i
peer
at
it
from
the
front
of
my
glass
a
simple
snowy
white
head
accompanies
one
through
the
journey
aromas
are
at
once
yeastybreadyall
sweet
grain
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
clean
and
moderately
refreshing
flavors
are
malt
focused
though
a
slight
bitter
provides
balance
this
is
a
simple
brew
bound
for
simpler
fare
i
can
see
a
plate
of
veal
sausages
cheeses
bretzels
shnitzel
all
working
here
a
rather
drinkable
choice
for
the
happily
unchallenged
imbiber
my
first
kolsch
and
though
its
not
a
jawdropping
style
its
a
nice
session
beer
and
one
id
likely
have
again
clear
gold
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
herbal
noble
hops
and
a
little
dry
malt
the
flavor
is
dry
straw
malt
with
hop
bitterness
finishing
it
out
not
bad
easy
drinking
although
id
probably
have
trouble
telling
it
apart
from
a
decent
german
pilsner
in
a
blind
taste
test
pours
with
a
onefinger
white
head
fades
quickly
but
leaves
some
lace
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
faint
hoppy
nose
medium
carbonation
starts
with
a
balance
of
hops
and
malt
and
makes
a
hoppy
finish
clean
and
light
bodied
2
50
for
a
500ml
bottle
i
tried
this
again
from
a
5
liter
german
keg
can
and
boy
was
it
good
a
goldenyellow
liquid
flowed
out
of
the
tapa
nd
the
head
was
fluffy
and
as
white
as
the
purest
german
snow
this
head
was
thicker
than
the
one
i
got
from
the
bottle
and
it
also
left
better
intricate
lacing
patterns
as
well
the
aromas
are
excellent
this
brew
has
the
aromas
of
lemon
peels
light
floral
hops
and
a
light
biscuity
malt
flavor
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
lovely
malts
up
front
and
in
the
middle
and
the
biting
hops
on
the
backend
with
that
lingering
citrus
and
biscuit
finish
the
finish
has
a
wonderful
hop
bite
to
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
spirtzy
and
the
drinkability
is
perfect
a
nice
kolsch
even
better
from
the
german
minikeg
cans
super
drinkable
brew
overall
reissdorf
kolsch
ale
was
a
weak
attempt
at
a
germanmade
pbr
pbr
is
much
better
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
ludwigs
and
it
seemed
better
than
this
bottled
version
slightly
disappointed
this
beer
poured
a
pale
and
translucent
light
golden
yellow
well
carbonated
and
topped
by
a
thinning
white
head
some
fruity
grains
in
the
aroma
fruity
sweet
tangy
malts
in
the
taste
this
seems
more
sweeter
than
dry
with
a
sweetly
light
body
of
grains
with
a
slight
winey
finish
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
finish
pleasantly
drinkable
but
nothing
all
that
special
i
just
happened
across
this
beer
during
my
last
trip
to
lexington
when
i
opened
the
500ml
and
poured
in
the
glass
i
began
to
get
excited
the
light
golden
color
was
exactly
what
i
thought
a
great
kolsch
should
be
the
pour
was
excellent
started
with
a
good
1
114
inch
head
that
quickly
went
away
leaving
the
perfect
white
froth
on
top
the
slightly
fruity
and
very
slighty
spicy
aroma
left
alot
to
be
desired
this
was
probably
the
only
let
down
in
the
bottle
the
slight
hop
bite
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
followed
by
a
smooth
finish
that
can
only
be
called
refreshing
just
screamed
kolsch
to
me
behind
alt
this
is
my
favorite
german
style
i
would
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
who
wanted
to
try
kolsch
for
the
first
time
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
wellbalanced
easy
drinking
brew
reissdorf
kolsch
is
one
of
the
better
kolsches
ive
sampled
this
would
make
for
a
good
summer
refresher
it
poured
a
clear
light
gold
with
evident
carbonation
it
had
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
disipated
it
smelled
of
hops
and
spice
the
kolsch
tasted
very
hoppy
with
little
malt
it
had
a
nice
tinge
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
its
feel
was
oily
and
light
bodied
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
i
had
never
had
a
kolsch
before
but
it
sure
appears
that
the
style
has
been
copied
often
by
many
american
beers
pours
a
light
clear
golden
colour
with
minimal
head
the
appearance
is
lightlooking
but
healthy
certainly
more
golden
and
colourful
than
a
macro
the
smell
is
grainy
with
wheat
a
bit
of
butter
some
hop
and
some
sweetness
as
well
the
taste
here
isnt
bad
its
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
smell
but
less
sweet
and
more
buttery
with
a
grain
finish
the
problem
with
this
style
for
me
is
that
ive
always
found
it
to
be
rather
boring
could
this
be
a
decent
session
brew
sure
but
id
rather
a
boatload
of
other
brews
with
more
flavour
for
my
session
brew
than
this
one
i
certainly
wouldnt
complain
about
having
to
drink
this
kolsch
again
but
its
not
a
must
try
brew
in
my
book
the
bottle
screams
german
with
its
towering
presence
and
imposing
red
white
and
gold
label
the
beer
is
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
the
smell
is
on
the
light
side
with
just
a
trace
of
hops
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
subdued
although
some
malty
flavor
comes
through
with
just
enough
hops
to
be
detectable
nothing
distinguishes
it
as
an
outstandingor
really
even
better
than
averagebeer
it
might
make
a
decent
introductory
beer
for
those
looking
to
expand
their
horizons
but
at
3
50
for
a
500
ml
bottle
its
a
somewhat
pricey
experiment
i
think
i
may
have
had
one
kolsch
quite
some
time
ago
this
is
the
first
time
i
tried
this
one
very
light
carbonated
and
dry
this
is
probably
what
miller
high
life
aspires
to
be
the
champagne
of
beers
because
this
beer
has
somewhat
similar
characteristics
overall
a
bit
light
for
my
tastes
but
as
good
as
most
lagers
or
pils
ive
had
small
fizzy
head
very
little
retention
or
lace
just
a
nice
spritzy
little
beer
its
become
unavoidable
in
this
weeks
visit
to
köln
for
me
to
believe
the
word
kölsch
as
a
synonym
with
mediocre
thats
my
opinion
when
i
think
of
this
brew
which
rather
impersonates
a
simple
light
bodied
lager
like
brew
with
a
hint
of
a
refreshing
acidity
to
it
however
it
is
in
itself
rather
flat
despite
the
head
rather
tasteless
despite
the
properties
and
without
even
an
overdoing
in
the
hops
which
is
a
general
way
to
pick
them
up
the
ground
im
done
with
reissdorf
for
a
while
or
a
lifetime
even
if
coming
back
to
cologne
there
arent
many
beers
i
can
drink
a
liter
of
and
want
more
reissdorf
kölsch
is
one
of
them
overall
good
ale
for
lager
lovers
i
just
got
a
sample
taste
of
this
at
our
homebrew
club
meeting
but
enough
to
act
like
a
beer
judge
so
here
goes
malty
with
a
kind
of
raw
grainy
texture
to
it
a
pleasing
extra
kick
of
hops
nice
bubbly
zest
typical
for
its
style
so
far
the
only
true
german
kölsch
ive
had
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
everything
american
big
brews
claim
to
be
in
their
commercials
i
guess
pours
a
nice
golden
hue
with
a
pretty
large
head
that
lingers
for
a
few
minutes
a
faint
grassy
clean
aroma
tastes
very
nice
almost
yeasty
hard
to
find
any
hops
in
this
one
if
only
it
were
a
bit
more
affordable
in
the
states
this
would
be
a
nearperfect
session
beer
my
bottle
poured
out
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
which
remained
for
a
good
while
it
might
be
my
nose
but
there
was
nothing
exceptional
about
the
smell
of
this
brew
however
i
did
enjoy
the
beer
itself
it
was
crisp
with
enough
carbonation
to
liven
up
my
tastebuds
this
to
me
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
when
youre
going
to
enjoy
more
than
one
pale
golden
color
with
a
blooming
white
head
that
dies
rather
quickly
having
sparse
carbonation
smells
malty
earthy
and
funky
in
an
ale
sense
kind
of
like
a
wet
dog
hops
are
there
but
subtle
tastes
malty
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
florally
dry
hop
finish
carbonation
is
minimal
other
than
a
few
streaming
bubbles
which
i
feel
draws
back
from
the
overall
experience
in
this
beer
i
could
however
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summery
day
comments

this
authentic
kolsch
ale
brewed
in
köln
had
some
characteristics
of
a
very
good
example
i
thought
the
appearance
was
right
on
target
and
the
soft
fruits
playing
with
the
light
hops
was
terrific
it
missed
the
mark
in
other
areas
though
especially
the
aroma
a
near
miss
in
my
book
but
a
good
effort
nevertheless
however
a
word
of
advice
while
reissdorf
is
a
very
good
beer
there
are
better
varieties
of
kölsch
to
be
had
in
köln
taste
is
not
too
much
different
than
a
hefe
surprisingly
bready
and
yeasty
with
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
carbonation
makes
it
nice
to
quaff
alot
of
it
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
nice
german
kolsch
light
gold
color
medium
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
fruity
grainy
and
sweet
a
light
bodied
kolsch
ale
lightly
malted
and
slightly
hoppy
there
is
a
subtle
not
overbearing
lemony
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
crisp
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
never
had
this
style
but
it
seems
just
like
any
german
lager
to
me
does
have
a
sight
hop
presence
in
the
aroma
but
only
slightly
bitter
tasting
kind
of
bland
for
an
ale
with
little
flavor
fresh
tasting
none
the
less
and
a
good
thirst
quencher
that
went
well
with
a
german
style
lunch
pours
a
straw
cior
with
a
pretty
good
fluffy
headaroma
is
malty
with
some
fruitiness
with
the
germanlike
iron
aroma
flavor
is
softly
malty
with
some
nice
light
fruitiness
with
a
delicate
floweriness
to
it
high
quality
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
recommend
this
on
a
warm
summer
day
for
sure
poured
with
a
clear
golden
body
and
a
thin
lacy
white
head
it
has
a
malty
nose
with
just
a
hair
of
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
grass
the
flavor
was
more
reminiscent
of
a
bock
than
a
kolsch
with
a
very
malty
flavor
with
hints
of
caramel
and
wheat
smooth
warm
mouthfeel
with
a
fair
bit
of
body
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
aftertaste
pleasantly
drinkable
there
is
nothing
overpowering
about
this
beer
its
just
a
refreshing
thirst
quenching
highly
drinkable
beer
everything
a
kölsch
is
supposed
to
be
there
was
nothing
all
that
special
that
stood
out
with
this
beer
it
was
just
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
no
outstanding
characteristics
to
rave
about
it
was
just
another
beer
it
poured
a
small
sized

that
quickly
dissipated
the
body

clear
with

and
some

a
little

with

it

a
thin

it

lovely
this
completely
changes
the
way
i
look
at
kölsch
beers
for
the
better
recommended
completely

with
light
golden

color
a
substantial
fine

with
minimal

a
bit
of
persistent

is
more
pleasant
and
strong
than
expected
in
a
beer
that
looks
so
light
crisp
grains
rule
the
day
with
some
breadiness
and
a
dash
of
spice
grainy
taste
that
doesnt
vary
a
great
deal
from
start
to

though
the

gets

it
warms
the
flavor

the
finish
which
is

dry

godfriggindamn
drinkable
a
crystal
clear
golden
body
topped
by
a
rather
thin
white
head
that
creates
moderate
lacing
the
nose
is
mostly
malt
with
hints
of
fruit
that
portray
a
lightness
that
really
isnt
isnt
present
in
the
taste
this
is
a
very
nice
kolsch
that
imparts
lovely
crispness
in
the
finish
i
found
this
to
be
a
thoroughly
refreshing
late
summer
beer
with
good
feel
and
drinkability
flavor
is
initially
malty
with
hops
appearing
about
halfway
through
the
sip
and
finishing
the
beer
crisp
and
clean
almost
no
aftertaste
save
a
touch
of
pale
malt
well
carbonated
and
refreshing
kolsch
is
a
wonderful
style
when
its
done
correctly
this
is
what
the
kolsch
style
should
taste
like
on
draught
this
pours
a
light
golden
straw
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
rings
of
lace
down
the
glass
although
it
does
need
occasional
agitation
the
head
sticks
around
for
the
duration
of
the
brew
aroma
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
almost
spicy
relatively
bitter
hops
and
a
fresh
yeasty
profile
as
well
this
is
a
flavorful
brew
with
a
sweetish
full
malt
character
that
melds
well
with
the
predominantly
bitter
but
overall
mild
german
hops
oddly
enough
notes
of
oakwood
seem
present
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
as
the
brew
warms
up
a
bit
it
becomes
almost
syrupy
but
in
a
good
way
incredibly
drinkable
this
would
be
an
excellent
summer
thirst
quencher
all
that
a
kolsch
should
be
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
can
locate
it
on
draught
when
i
think
of
just
a
plain
old
beer
simple
yet
tasty
this
would
be
it
it
poured
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
good
head
slightly
bitter
but
not
very
clean
tasting
almost
to
a
point
of
refreshing
a
slight
gruff
taste
of
rawness
as
it
slides
down
your
throat
very
good
indeed
overall
its
a
very
simple
and
refreshing
beer
this
is
almost
what
i
would
imagine
bud
tasted
like
before
it
got
mass
produced
a
very
clear
almost
yellw
color
with
very
little
head
aroma
was
slightly
bready
and
spicy
taste
showed
a
good
bit
of
grain
as
well
as
hop
bitterness
very
crisp
and
drinkable
looking
at
my
score
i
realize
i
enjoyed
the
beer
more
than
the
numbers
reflect
is
it
a
great
beer
no
but
i
will
buy
it
more
often
than
some
beers
ive
given
higher
reviews
it
just
so
damn
drinkable
grain
aromas
with
a
slight
sweetness
grain
carries
through
to
the
flavor
where
other
malt
flavors
come
through
but
are
quite
subdued
not
much
bitterness
at
all
beer
poured
a
clear
gold
in
color
with
a
fine
bubbles
coming
from
the
well
carbonated
brew
this
is
my
first
foray
into
the
world
of
kolsch
beers
and
i
am
impressed
and
eager
for
more
cant
believe
this
is
an
ale
a
wonderful
beer
to
sip
a
great
mix
of
flavors
this
kölsch
poured
a
clear
strawyellow
color
with
creamy
thick
white
foam
that
eventually
settled
but
did
not
leave
much
lace
the
smell
was
mild
slightly
sweet
malt
and
grain
the
taste
was
very
malty
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
biscuit
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
mediumlight
body
with
low
carbonation
feel
but
was
smooth
the
drinkability
was
decent
very
easy
to
drink
i
found
the
tap
version
a
bit
more
tasty
500ml
bottle
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
receded
fairly
quickly
smell
of
the
malt
and
hops
is
present
but
not
overpowering
decent
carbonation
a
pleasing
taste
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
i
could
definetly
drink
this
all
night
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
i
wish
more
of
its
cousins
from
cologne
were
available
in
the
states
awesome
kölsch
crystal
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
looking
white
head
sitting
on
top
the
nose
is
very
inviting
the
malt
subtleties
really
play
a
tune
for
my
nose
and
seemingly
some
noble
hop
accents
i
like
the
soft
malt
tones
on
the
tongue
pilsnerlike
maltiness
but
not
as
heavy
some
minor
fruitiness
is
noted
a
tanginess
from
some
wheat
malt
perhaps
and
very
subtle
hop
flavor
from
what
i
believe
is
a
hallertau
or
something
similar
surprisingly
big
body
at
least
mediumfull
creamy
texture
on
the
tongue
allows
this
one
to
slide
down
with
ease
pretty
enjoyable
but
not
the
grand
experience
i
was
in
search
of
i
suspect
that
my
bottle
of
reissdorf
may
have
been
skunked
afterall
i
bought
it
in
williamsburg
va
and
theres
no
telling
how
long
it
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
if
im
ever
in
köln
ill
give
this
beer
another
try
pat
the
flavor
starts
out
sweet
with
a
nice
pale
malt
content
it
then
gets
joined
with
a
nice
hoppiness
a
little
bit
of
fruits
very
crisp
start
that
smoothes
to
an
almost
creamy
feel
good
session
beer
and
it
accompanies
a
meal
very
well
prost

crossdressed

sour
mouthfeel

upon

up

with

unpleasant
sulfur

vegetable
notes
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
lightly
dry
champagelike
cedary
finish
with
a
light
dose
of
bittering
hops
and
subtle
graininess
this
brew
is
akin
to
a
us
domestic
macrobrew
in
every
way
if
i
were
blinded
i
would
guess
it
was
an
ab
product
there
is
no
real
substance
or
appealing
qualities
to
this
beer
although
it
is
average
in
every
respect
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
one
ever
again
overall
whilst
i
appreciate
that
this
is
a
kölsch
bier
i
feel
that
it
is
just
a
little
too
delicate
i
would
have
liked
it
to
have
a
bit
oomph
in
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
still
it
is
not
a
bad
offering
pours
with
a
bright
white

that
settles
over
clear

liquid
gently
carbonated
nose
has
some
sweet

a

a

hop
bitterness
makes
just
a
short
appearence
towards
the
end
not
as
much

as
i
was
hoping
for

light

w
a

an
innocuous
simple
and
highly
quaffable
brew
it
possesses
pilsneresque
crispness
and
a
restrained
english
bitter
like
fruitiness
its
the
perfect
brew
to
start
the
evening
since
it
leaves
the
palate
longing
for
more
almost
elegant
drinkability
pretty
high
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
and
would
be
something
i
could
drink
several
of
in
the
summer
good
stuff
light

a
thin
white
lace
that
trials
down
the
glass
aroma

slightly
sweet
flavor
and
very
dry
and
crisp
with
a
light

flavor
has
grainy

characteristics
this
is
an
amazingly
complex
kölsch
and
would
be
an
excellent
brew
to
relax
with
on
a
hot
day
hell
even
in
the
middle
of
october
its
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
sweet

wellrounded
are
good
descriptions
for
this

317
in
the
history
of
beer
if
the
discovery
of
lager
was
preordained
then
this
is
an
ale
that
must
have
served
like
a
road
map
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
i
would
say
it
was
a
particularly
complex
fullflavored
lager
the
color
is
bright
yellow
with
mustard
and
gold
tones
the
creamy
white
head
resolves
quickly
into
a
splotchy
lunarsurface
pattern
the
nose
is
remarkable
with
aromas
of
tangy
nectarine
cornflakes
shredded
wheat
and
milk
that
is
just
starting
to
turn
sour
the
flavors
reveal
custard
designer
water
and
lemon
with
a
slight
sprinkle
of
bitter
herb
bright
clean
and
seamless
absolutely
gulpable
sampled
with
kolschs
pyramid
curveball
and
schell
zommerfest
i
have
enjoyed
this
on
tap
at
zum
schneider
in
nyc
but
am
currently
sampling
from
the
bottle
not
as
good
as
on
tap
but
splendid
nevertheless
clear
light
golden
color
with
full
head
that
settles
unassuming
aroma
clean
grainy
taste
with
big
grassy
malts
and
just
the
right
dry
hop
sparkle
in
the
bottle
this
tastes
less
like
a
kolsch
and
closer
to
a
golden
lager
or
pilsner
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
yet
dry
and
clean
does
wonders
for
settling
the
stomach
i
think
this
is
the
only
true
german
kolsch
you
can
get
stateside
and
its
a
fine
representative
marvellous
brew
you
could
drink
this
shit
all
night
light
clear
goldyellow
in
colour
head
doesnt
last
long
slight
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
exceptional
mouthfeel
slight
sweet
malty
start
with
a
dry
hop
bitterness
tremendoulsy
easy
to
drink
and
even
quite
complex
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
straw
color
and
formed
a
nice
white
head
leaving
little
lace
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
the
aroma
was
of
lightly
of
hops
with
grainy
malt
present
giving
a
bit
of
a
breadlike
aroma
the
flavor
was
of
hops
and
was
a
touch
grainy
the
finish
was
a
touch
tart
due
to
the
carbonation
havent
tried
too
many
of
this
style
so
review
may
change
this
is
one
of
the
traditional
kölsch
beers
out
of
germany
you
cant
really
say
more
than
that
notes
beyond
drinkable
this
brew
is
a
great
way
to
wet
the
appetite
whether
it
is
before
a
meal
or
the
beginning
of
an
all
night
session
of
drinking
this
is
okay
i
like
my
kölsches
to
have
a
great
maltiness
this
does
well
on
the
hoppiness
but
there
is
barely
any
malt
presence
increase
the
malt
and
this
would
be
a
home
run
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
minimal
head
or
lace
biscuity
malty
profile
and
a
bit
herbal
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
biscuity
bready
taste
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
smooth
and
even
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
kolsch
that
drinks
easy
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
bought
in
a
variety
pack
at
randolph
afb
poured
a
medium
dark
gold
with
very
little
head
into
a
pint
glass
nice
flavor
with
no
apparent
hops
i
little
citrus
leftover
overall
a
drinkable
beer
once
the
real
good
stuff
is
gone
notes
exceptionally
well
done
true
to
style
o
when
i
tasted
this
it
immediately
became
one
of
my
very
favorite
beers
this
is
the
beer
that
you
can
easily
cruise
through
a
6
12
pack
on
hot
summer
day
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
succession
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
golden
straw
color
moderate
froth
and
little
lacing
scent
is
pale
and
contain
some
musty
and
tangy
grain
light
earthy
hopping
taste
is
bolder
than
many
kolsches
ive
sampled
grain
profile
stronger
in
taste
but
earthy
hop
presence
right
on
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
overall
a
nice
highly
drinkable
beer
surprised
by
the
boldness
of
the
abvs
d
alright
for
the
style
but
on
the
fruity
end
of
the
spectrum
light
malts
balanced
hops
lots
of
fruity
estery
yeast
contribution
simple
yet
flavorful
and
refreshing
enough
personally
i
like
a
kolsch
to
be
softer
and
more
grainy
malt
forward
my
preferences
aside
this
fruity
number
is
alright
nice
to
see
a
gateway
brewery
take
an
okay
stab
at
the
style
o
cant
complain
a
sessionable
beer
for
warm
days
nothing
mind
blowing
nothing
dissapointing
either
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
but
nothing
really
objectionable
either
goes
pretty
well
with
a
burger
no
pun
to
the
burghers
intended
what
this
is
missing
is
some
yeast
funk
and
a
more
pronounced
but
not
necessarily
more
aggressive
or
upfront
yeast
funk
not
a
bad
beer
its
drinkable
just
not
on
the
level
of
the
great
examples
of
this
style
o
very
drinkable
to
style
very
mild
in
character
all
the
way
around
this
beer
formed
a
1
and
a
half
inch
head
which
it
lost
somewhat
rapidly
it
was
straw
colored
and
transparent
i
could
read
the
beer
label
through
the
mug
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
it
had
a
bready
smell
it
was
not
big
on
carbonation
but
carbonation
was
evident
in
the
mouth
feel
it
was
thicker
then
water
but
not
much
it
made
my
mouth
pucker
somewhat
and
had
a
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
though
not
overwhelmingly
so
wish
i
could
get
these
in
a
6
pack
by
themselves
it
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
as
it
is
i
find
them
the
best
of
all
the
beers
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
i
may
be
wrong
as
with
this
dundee
variety
pack
i
am
eating
chesapeake
bay
oysters
that
are
wonderful
but
i
taste
corn
in
all
of
the
beers
and
that
gets
a
big
boo
from
me
jzesus
caint
i
just
make
a
simple
comment
why
all
the
required
fields
its
only
rock
and
roll
working
through
a
dundee
sampler
pack
thanks
to
my
brother
nice
guy
this
offering
pours
a
clear
sortapale
straw
topped
by
a
shortlived
halffinger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
tangelo
zest
musty
biscuits
very
light
toffee
and
old
nutmeg
the
taste
runs
very
similarly
with
some
lemon
zest
joining
the
fun
along
with
some
light
black
pepper
and
a
few
drips
of
honey
the
spiciness
twangs
the
tongue
nigh
into
numbness
luckily
things
dont
last
too
long
as
every
flavor
flies
off
rather
quickly
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
i
didnt
enjoy
this
kolsch
too
much
i
wish
i
could
say
more
but
i
really
cant
sorry
highly
drinkable
great
light
summer
beer
its
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
with
no
real
flawed
flavors
it
seems
less
hoppy
than
most
that
i
have
tried
for
the
style
i
also
get
that
slight
fruity
grape
flavor
as
well
from
the
yeast
which
tastes
fantastic
and
really
makes
the
beer
the
fruity
grape
taste
mixes
in
perfectly
with
the
slight
spicy
hop
they
decided
to
use
in
this
beer
its
a
very
straight
forward
beer
and
thats
whole
point
of
this
beer
it
really
drinks
like
a
5
percent
beer
rather
than
the
almost
6
percent
that
it
is
o
easydrinking
kolsch
that
is
refreshing
but
doesnt
knock
me
off
my
feet
in
any
category
the
beer
is
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
smell
is
mostly
grain
and
lemon
and
there
is
a
surprising
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
little
different
i
could
point
out
some
grassy
hop
flavors
with
lemon
and
biscuit
there
is
still
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
beer
is
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
this
was
a
different
beer
not
like
any
other
kolsch
i
have
ever
had
its
ok
but
tastes
kind
of
homebrewy
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
yellow
color
the
head
was
slim
but
not
too
bad
the
smell
was
sweet
and
a
little
grassy
the
taste
was
sweet
and
fairly
light
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
afters
taste
no
hop
flavor
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
fits
the
style
overall
its
not
a
bad
kolsch
but
not
as
good
as
some
others
out
there
ended
up
with
a
selection
of
dundee
beers
from
a
houseguest
and
decided
to
pop
the
kolsch
really
not
too
bad
i
wouldnt
give
this
any
awards
and
i
miss
the
cool
slightly
spicy
tanginess
of
a
really
good
kolsch
but
this
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
night
pours
golden
with
good
clarity
and
a
decent
pure
white
head
that
has
some
medium
retention
somewhat
grainy
in
the
nose
with
a
slight
tanginess
the
taste
has
the
same
graininess
a
touch
of
mellow
fruit
and
some
mild
tanginess
a
little
too
soft
in
the
mouth
for
my
taste
particularly
on
the
finish
but
there
is
a
decent
body
and
a
touch
of
spice
lurking
as
well
not
bad
body
seems
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
the
carbonation
is
good
but
i
love
to
have
a
lighter
body
here
overall
this
one
isnt
anything
special
not
the
most
offensive
beer
but
i
dont
think
this
is
one
to
even
bother
with
o
an
ok
beer
i
guess
i
havent
had
too
many
examples
of
this
style
but
all
have
been
mediocre
a
worthy
beer
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
somewhat
unique
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
try
it
once
and
move
on
oboring
but
no
negative
qualities
great
for
a
hot
day
not
sure
this
is
great
for
a
kolsch
though
ive
only
had
one
other
kolsch
and
it
was
much
better
tasting
the
mouthfeel
is
easily
this
beers
strong
suit
its
wellcarbonated
and
has
that
nice
drying
sensation
on
the
end
of
the
mouth
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
this
is
just
an
alright
kolsch
its
not
bad
but
ive
had
much
better
i
found
this
beer
to
be
almost
perfect
as
a
drinker
of
lighter
colored
brews
i
have
many
options
i
found
this
in
a
multipack
at
a
kroger
store
needless
to
say
i
had
low
expectations
i
was
amazed
i
found
this
to
be
a
fantastic
bargain
it
comes
with
all
the
drinkability
of
an
adjunct
beer
with
all
of
the
flavor
that
i
would
expect
from
a
hand
crafted
brew
it
was
light
yet
filling
a
flavor
of
spice
and
lemon
i
give
his
a
thumbs
up
i
think
ill
have
another
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
id
definetely
drink
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
light
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
and
corn
with
a
little
a
bit
of
something
off
in
it
not
a
nice
smelling
beer
the
flavor
is
also
not
too
great
i
get
some
corn
and
malt
as
well
as
some
sugary
sweetness
there
is
a
little
bit
of
grape
in
the
flavor
but
it
is
overshadowed
by
the
other
grainy
flavors
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
a
beer
to
seek
out
poured
into
a
strange
glass
looks
beautiful
a
tall
white
head
zigzags
around
the
entire
glass
the
body
is
supremely
clear
gold
as
real
gold
with
tons
of
slow
carb
trails
smell
is
crackery
with
a
bit
of
pepper
on
the
nose
feel
is
sort
of
viscous
taste
is
a
conglomeration
of
clean
malts
mild
hops
and
sorta
annoying
minerals
finishes
with
some
pleasant
spiciness
to
be
honest
i
wish
this
brew
tasted
more
like
it
looked
but
it
was
pretty
darn
good
anyways
o
id
drink
this
one
again
it
was
a
good
thirst
quencher
that
the
macro
lovers
would
get
into
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
just
what
the
style
should
be
the
smell
and
taste
remind
me
of
a
chardonnay
go
figure
anyway
i
like
it
and
am
glad
that
it
rounds
out
the
12
pack
mixer
i
bought
my
aggro
pour
resulted
in
two
fingers
worth
of
thick
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
that
would
have
made
king
midas
proud
plus
it
exhibited
nequality
clarity
a
very
pretty
beer
nose
was
as
advertised
with
biscuity
malt
notes
now
i
was
beginning
to
slaver
in
anticipation
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pleasant
lightly
sweet
maltiness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
also
as
advertised
clean
and
crisp
i
could
easily
put
a
sixer
of
this
away
on
a
hot
humid
summer
day
plus
i
have
not
had
a
clinker
yet
from
the
dundee
line
this
is
a
series
worth
exploring
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
well
balanced
flavor
and
crisp
mouthfeel
make
this
a
good
session
beer
that
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
backing
it
up
worth
a
look
for
sure
especially
at
the
relatively
cheap
price
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
one
finger
of
bright
white
foam
with
good
retention
aromas
are
typical
kolsh
light
grassy
hops
and
light
graininess
and
honey
taste
is
predominantly
sweet
and
perfectly
consistent
with
the
nose
very
refreshing
simple
straightforward
nothing
fancy
but
nothing
foul
solid
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
thoroughly
drinkable
beers
i
know
i
wouldnt
place
it
above
pilsner
urquell
but
yeah
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
its
a
terrific
hot
afternoon
beer
as
usual
the
score
you
see
here
is
weighted
too
heavily
on
appearance
and
aroma
so
one
more
average
beer
slips
by
with
a
b
something
rating
d
theres
really
nothing
to
this
beer
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
is
rather
boring
another
not
great
but
darn
good
beer
at
a
bargain
price
the
rest
body
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
beer
hurt
by
the
graininess
thats
always
lingering
around
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
some
malts
taste
is
good
malts
biscuty
slightly
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
however
the
beer
does
lack
certain
grain
hop
and
sulphur
aromasflavors
that
are
found
in
kolsches
like
reisdorf
and
others
d
highly
drinkable
esp
on
warmer
days
drinkability
as
a
kölsch
its
neither
particularly
authentic
nor
particularly
good
but
it
is
easily
drinkable
so
its
essentially
onpar
with
the
rest
of
their
offerings
as
dundee
is
branching
out
with
their
mixed
12packs
this
beer
is
clear
and
heady
with
a
golden
color
and
tightly
cropped
lace
dusty
biscuits
faintly
fruity
yeast
and
a
vague
note
of
honey
are
all
in
the
nose
the
crispness
goes
deep
its
lightish
body
does
get
a
fluff
from
the
carbonation
with
ample
malt
to
go
around
the
hops
are
well
placed
and
its
bitterness
keeps
the
beer
on
an
even
keel
spicy
hops
and
a
bite
of
grain
are
in
the
drying
finish
clean
and
spoton
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
light
ale
which
is
comparable
to
the
originals
d
light
dry
and
drinkable
there
isnt
anything
particularly
complex
going
on
here
but
what
does
one
really
expect
from
a
kolsch
the
malt
is
pleasant
and
bready
but
finishes
appropriately
dry
with
light
herbal
hops
my
only
real
complaint
is
the
utter
lack
of
head
and
lace
it
looks
almost
like
white
wine
in
the
glass
pretty
decent
especially
for
the
price
what
struck
me
about
this
beer
was
the
crisp
fresh
feel
it
had
to
it
very
clean
throughout
appearance
and
smell
were
pretty
average
with
typical
color
and
no
unique
or
very
distinguishable
scents
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
to
go
with
a
picnic
or
to
watch
a
baseball
game
this
is
a
beer
thats
worth
a
sample
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
ales
of
the
german
decent
this
is
a
nice
beer
while
this
is
not
really
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
it
lacks
the
crispness
that
comes
with
most
sweeter
beers
that
positions
themselves
on
drinkability
over
a
really
full
bodies
texture
or
flavor
d
a
little
flavorful
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
even
though
its
just
a
mediocre
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
poundable
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
d
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
isnt
especially
fun
to
drink
a
decent
brew
for
the
price
and
a
worthy
beer
for
most
fridges
but
nothing
special
head
of
two
finger
proportions
white
in
color
and
medium
foam
lace
broken
yet
lots
of
cling
layer
on
layer
color
a
6
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
clear
with
few
carbonation
bubbles
smell
of
wet
straw
wheat
malt
and
lemons
tastes
of
roasted
wheat
corn
barley
malt
lemon
and
a
whips
of
pine
medium
body
across
my
tongue
and
teeth
not
bad
but
not
great
not
one
i
would
turn
down
if
offered
and
would
buy
above
most
of
the
big
three
d
setting
aside
issues
of
faithfulness
to
style
i
would
classify
this
as
boring
but
refreshing
would
be
pretty
decent
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
safe
unadventurous
beer
which
is
a
good
or
bad
thing
depending
upon
the
occasion
and
the
drinker
conclusion
well
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
if
i
brewed
it
i
would
be
happy
it
isnt
the
best
around
for
this
style
however
and
is
better
enjoyed
as
an
attempt
at
the
style
and
not
something
to
reference
when
talk
about
kolsch
ales
d
not
my
favorite
style
by
a
long
shot
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
decent
tasting
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
its
worth
a
try
sometime
drinkability
nice
session
beer
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
with
diner
d
decent
drinkability
for
an
average
brew
this
kolsch
needs
some
work
but
its
not
awful
bought
this
in
a
sample
12pack
im
enjoying
this
one
as
well
as
i
did
the
others
its
got
a
sweet
taste
but
is
a
lite
brew
the
kind
of
brew
you
want
to
binge
drink
and
party
all
night
slighty
fruity
and
wheaty
it
did
have
some
nice
carbonation
i
agree
with
the
other
reviews
that
this
would
beat
out
other
lite
beers
it
goes
down
the
hatch
real
easy
pick
some
up
also
its
cheap
oyeah
and
goes
well
with
pretzels
bought
the
dundee
sampler
cause
it
was
cheap
damned
monetary
constraints
and
this
ended
up
being
my
surprise
favorite
of
the
bunch
i
typically
am
not
a
kolsch
fan
but
this
brew
was
quite
well
done
nice
straw
color
however
lacked
any
head
really
which
was
disappointing
to
me
smells
of
light
citrus
wheat
and
maybe
a
slight
sweet
honeyesque
aroma
very
nice
taste
is
similar
very
bubbly
with
some
sweetness
and
wheat
flavors
simple
yet
balanced
and
very
drinkable
great
example
of
the
style
to
me
this
beer
was
almost
as
pleasantly
surprising
for
me
as
tom
cruise
in
tropic
thunder
fairly
light
bodied
crisp
carbonation
and
fairly
drinkable
for
a
stab
at
the
style
i
think
dundee
could
have
done
better
things
that
make
you
go
hum
i
saw
this
beer
on
the
shelf
and
asked
why
not
well
the
reason
was
obvious
once
i
got
it
home
and
popped
the
cap
no
life
and
no
head
can
you
say
skanky
i
thought
you
could
the
dundee
stout
was
not
too
bad
but
this
kolsch
ale
is
simply
tasteless
and
stale
d
dundee
makes
a
brew
that
can
be
pounded
kolsch
style
is
a
brew
that
you
can
drink
over
and
over
compliments
for
the
surprising
flavor
and
the
slam
dunk
drinkability
out
of
the
sampler
this
is
by
far
the
most
drinkable
decent
drink
though
the
spice
notes
become
a
bit
overwhelming
and
seem
a
bit
out
of
character
think
a
spiced
summer
cooler
instead
of
winter
warmer
and
youve
got
it
it
finishes
somewhat
crisp
but
with
a
flavor
of
alcohol
that
is
more
noticeable
than
expected
medium
to
light
feel
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
this
brew
isnt
really
that
enjoyable
the
sweetness
verse
hops
verse
alcohol
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
havent
had
a
bunch
of
kolsch
style
offerings
but
i
can
tell
you
this
one
is
average
at
best
if
you
want
to
maximize
your
enjoyment
level
with
this
beer
make
sure
you
have
a
glass
with
etching
on
the
bottom
of
it
and
fire
away
i
say
about
this
beer
what
ill
say
about
all
of
dundees
beers
if
you
want
to
teach
someone
about
beer
by
some
dundee
styles
and
train
them
on
what
are
simple
examples
of
the
various
styles
this
one
is
a
bit
malty
for
a
kolsch
though
not
bad
not
great
tiny
lace
of
head
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
goes
down
like
watery
light
beer
not
much
smell
or
taste
to
speak
of
just
a
generic
light
beer
i
would
say
slightly
better
quality
than
budcoorskeystone
so
i
have
to
agree
with
the
reviewer
that
said
they
could
market
this
as
dundee
light
and
totally
destroy
the
other
light
labeled
beers
also
you
could
probably
drink
a
million
of
them
though
so
i
gave
it
a
good
score
there
not
my
favorite
in
this
mixed
pack
stick
to
the
pale
bock
or
the
stout
bottle
poured
a
light
blonde
color
kolsch
with
an
average
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
lightly
sweet
malt
with
clean
cereal
notes
taste
is
not
the
most
complex
with
some
satisfying
notes
of
cereal
and
lightly
sweet
background
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
refreshing
and
drinkable
though
not
as
complex
as
it
good
be

some
swaths
of

exposed
during
the
tasting
nose
is
not
as
clean
as
i
would
have
anticipated
for
a
kolsch
i
get
some
adjunct
and
maybe
a
trace
of
caramel
malt
and
honey
taste
follows
nose
however
some
light
fruity
esters
come
out
in
the
flavor
profile
and
the
finish
is
a
little
cleaner
than
the
nose
would
lead
one
to
believe
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
hops
is
expressed
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
a
lively
carbonation
that
approaches
a
prickle
across
the
center
of
the
tongue
i
feel
like
there
is
also
a
little
oiliness
or
slickness
in
the
mouthfeel
as
well
decent
but
not
by
favorite
domestic
kolsch
nonetheless
respectable
and
better
than
i
anticipated
a
good
mediumbodied
beer
good
taste
goes
down
easy
making
you
want
another
wonderfully
fresh
sweet
malt
smell
that
isnt
bothersome
like
most
sweet
noses
i
sample
dry
finish
for
a
smell
but
thats
a
bonus
something
different
and
cereallike
translates
well
into
the
taste
a
drier
finish
than
expected
crisp
mouthfeel
with
some
creaminess
great
summer
evening
brew
waste
your
sweat
on
a
lesser
brew
d
goes
down
easily
but
not
very
appealing
d
a
pretty
nice
brew
that
i
could
see
getting
again
pretty
much
standard
brew
that
is
both
full
of
flavor

drinkable

is
never
a
very
complex
brew
this
is
a
good
version
of
it
nice
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
at
least
worth
trying
out
pours
a
transparent
golden
copper
color
with
spare
white
frothy
head
spare
lacing
and
soft
carbonation
straw
like
malty
smell
with
lemon
hints
as
well
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
bread
citrus
hints
slightly
bitter
light
body
and
short
flavor
duration
thin
texture
that
goes
down
smooth
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
light
bitter
finish
a
fairly
descent
beer
a
first
time
with
this
style
of
beer
the
mouth
is
nice
and
crisp
while
this
is
an
easy
drinker
for
the
summer
the
beer
misses
several
touchstones
of
this
style
taste
is
light
and
crisp
definitely
the
sweet
malt
runs
the
show
a
buttery
slickness
on
the
tongue
lack
of
hops
is
a
bit
disappointing
but
im
not
surprised
at
the
lack
thereof
d
very
drinkable
theres
not
a
ton
of
flavor
though
so
it
doesnt
go
with
too
many
foods
disappointing
flavor
that
has
some
elements
of
belgian
yeast
berry
fruit
notes
that
are
particularly
strong
in
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
short
lived
and
somewhat
sour
like
sour
milk
good
body
and
carbonation
worthwhile
to
try
not
real
familiar
with
the
style
so
im
not
sure
if
its
a
great
kolsch
but
its
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
i
could
do
a
six
of
these
without
a
problem
bright
deep
golden
body
crystal
clear
hue
with
bright
white
head
forms
uneven
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
with
each
sip
aroma
semi
sweet
biscuit
malts
nice
bready
layers
form
with
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
pretty
tame
with
a
hint
of
a
copper
penny
or
metallic
note
flavor
slightly
fruit
notes
a
bready
malt
character
with
lingering
biscuit
dough
finish
slight
metallic
edge
that
doesnt
come
off
offensive
i
think
its
something
from
the
rochester
ny
water
i
tend
toget
a
lot
of
this
flavor
from
most
of
their
beer
mild
herbal
hops
not
much
bitterness
added
to
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
sturdy
carbonation
definitely
forced
overall
nothing
offensive
or
spectacular
a
nice
sessionable
pseudo
craft
brew
from
a
stand
up
regional
brewer
that
i
happen
to
care
for
drinkability
definitely
has
good
drinkability
this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
delivers
satisfying
belches
a
little
bit
but
not
too
much
still
is
missing
a
nice
kolsch
yeast
flavor
that
is
so
nice
in
classic
versions
of
the
style
sweet
grainy
malts
are
there
and
bolstered
by
some
toasty
and
crackery
notes
lacking
in
the
hop
department
but
there
is
a
mild
caress
of
bitterness
at
the
end
carbonation
level
is
high
but
kind
of
course
id
be
willing
to
bet
this
is
force
carbonated
its
a
mildly
refreshing
beer
that
is
fairly
unoffensive
but
it
does
not
really
represent
the
kolsch
style
very
well
not
a
bad
warm
weather
brew
seems
low
in
abv
so
you
can
put
a
few
away
without
becoming
loopy
also
isnt
any
worse
for
wear
as
it
gets
warmer
still
very
drinkable
d
this
is
an
okay
kolsch
the
taste
just
is
a
little
odd
notes
for
an
easy
drinking
light
summery
beer
this
will
work
nothing
cheap
tasting
about
this
a
decent
dundee
offering
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
six
pack
of
in
the
future
plus
the
price
i
thought
that
the
dundee
kolschstyle
ale
was
pretty
good
overall
not
the
best
but
a
beer
that
should
be
tried
the
appearance
is
what
it
is
expected
to
be
a
yellowtofaintamberinthemiddle
the
beer
left
a
good
112
inch
head
i
am
not
sure
if
my
glass
was
what
smelled
wierd
i
guess
i
should
have
smelled
it
first
but
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
lemony
but
also
something
not
great
at
all
it
might
have
been
a
biscuity
smell
i
thought
the
taste
was
good
compared
to
the
smell
i
could
defintely
taste
biscuit
flavors
and
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
the
beer
did
not
catch
well
in
my
mouth
as
i
kept
thinking
of
the
smell
i
will
only
drink
the
rest
of
these
in
order
with
the
rest
of
the
mixed
pack
not
bad
but
not
great
clear
and
gold
with
a
finger
of
white
head
the
head
shrinks
pretty
quickly
but
there
is
lots
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
lots
of
grainy
sweetness
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
lemon
taste
is
pretty
unimpressive
sweet
just
like
the
smell
and
again
with
the
touch
of
lemon
has
a
pretty
clean
finish
probably
the
worst
in
the
sampler
pack
the
beer
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
finish
the
hop
aroma
is
light
and
there
is
limited
yeast
character
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
pale
and
munich
malt
flavor
thats
a
tad
sweet
it
goes
down
easy
with
low
hops
and
a
subtle
yeast
fruitiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
ive
had
better
kolschs
but
this
is
a
quality
offering
sampled
on
april
13
2010
it
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
quickly
rising
carbonation
and
an
inch
to
inch
and
a
half
fiuzzy
white
head
that
pops
and
bubbles
down
to
a
thin
ring
malts
are
clearly
the
lead
aroma
with
a
nice
clean
but
light
hoppy
sensation
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
around
medium
the
malts
and
eurohops
blend
together
well
to
provide
a
decent
fresh
balance
that
remains
clean
to
the
end
this
was
rather
easy
to
drink
d
could
drink
it
for
a
while
but
think
best
served
cold
on
a
nice
summer
day
poolside
why
call
something
kolschstyle
when
it
doesnt
even
come
close
to
the
style
id
rather
have
a
real
kolsch
over
this
cheers
kind
of
a
summer
type
ale
tastes
like
a
generic
commercial
pale
ale
not
worth
reviewing
overall
a
brew
that
is
not
sure
what
it
is
trying
to
be
a
kölsch
a
pilsner
a
blonde
this
one
needs
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
an
exquisite
example
of
a
blonde
ale
straw
golden
and
transparent
with
a
white
frothy
head
very
clean
with
a
hint
of
vienna
malt
just
enough
flavor
to
not
be
distracting
and
leave
you
wanting
to
quaff
more
light
beer
i
had
on
draft
high
drink
ability
but
not
as
satisfying
as
i
had
hoped
from
a
blonde
ale
o
one
of
the
more
flavorful
kolschs
that
ive
had
and
seems
to
follow
the
style
very
good
session
option
overall
good
beer
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
fan
empty
taste
overall
it
may
not
be
big
but
it
has
plenty
of
subtler
flavors
mixed
in
that
go
very
well
together
clean
crisp
and
dry
kolsch
nicely
done
for
an
american
brewery
finishes
a
touch
more
astringent
than
some
of
the
finer
german
kolsch
but
quite
drinkable
terrific
subtle
flavor
profile
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
glad
i
tried
this
d
light
beer
good
flavors
and
very
sessionable
crisp
as
any
kolsch
should
be
the
verdict
pretty
good
good
taste
goes
down
smooth
a
great
session
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
not
sure
id
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
but
if
it
were
on
tap
at
my
favorite
pub
id
give
it
a
go
again
a
very
tasty
brew
i
would
have
another
once
for
sure
o
for
the
style
its
solid
its
a
simpler
style
but
as
im
drinking
it
the
sun
is
out
and
im
enjoying
sipping
on
it
if
youre
looking
for
some
mind
blowing
beer
this
isnt
it
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
enough
flavor
to
leave
you
enjoying
each
sip
overallfinish
could
be
longer
i
always
wanted
more
than
what
i
got
out
of
both
the
nose
and
flavors
overall
just
not
a
very
complex
beer
the
beer
is
light
golden
colored
and
topped
with
a
small
white
head
with
okay
retention
and
a
few
strings
of
lacing
the
aroma
smells
like
a
fresh
kolsch
with
hay
fruitiness
and
a
mineral
note
a
good
start
which
only
continues
into
the
taste
the
taste
is
a
little
stronger
per
style
with
a
brush
of
fruitness
pleasing
hay
whispers
of
malt
complemented
with
a
light
body
and
gentle
carbonation
for
a
beer
lover
who
has
had
fresh
kolsch
in
cologne
itself
saint
archer
has
hit
the
target
very
well
well
worth
the
purchase
and
a
better
option
than
yellowtail
pale
ale
among
san
diego
made
kolschstyled
beers
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
beer
of
the
month
club
selection
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
kolsch
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
traditional
kolsch
style
beers
this
is
an
amazing
representation
of
the
style
an
amazing
beer
for
these
beautiful
san
diego
summer
days
smell
taste
and
overall
apperance
of
the
beer
was
spot
on
way
to
go
saint
archer
cant
wait
to
try
your
other
styles
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
kolsch
beers
ive
had
it
was
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
would
definitely
have
again
and
recommend
if
you
have
someone
that
doesnt
like
craft
beer
or
is
stuck
on
bmc
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
them
try
clean
true
and
what
is
expected
of
a
kolsch
balanced
and
session
able
i
dont
typically
drink
this
style
and
have
been
handed
many
different
things
across
the
blonde
lable
it
is
nice
to
order
a
blonde
and
get
this
goes
down
easy
just
how
i
like
my
blondes
a
little
sharp
quite
light
bodied
with
that
distinctive
perfumey
flavor
quite
drinkable
with
a
hoppiness
that
seems
to
grow
as
you
sip
perhaps
more
hoppy
than
some
examples
of
the
style
but
so
much
better
than
many
american
examples
pleasingly
bitter
and
its
mellowed
by
something
like
graham
crackers
though
not
sweet
at
all
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
san
diego
at
a
price
id
like
to
see
more
of
4
15
this
is
a
lighter
style
of
ale
but
i
find
it
very
similar
to
a
lot
of
pilsners
recommendable
as
a
summer
seasonal
for
hot
weather
but
if
you
like
big
dark
beers
youll
find
it
unremarkable
easy
drinking
and
light
but
missing
some
depth
and
crispness
nice
sweetness
average
the
beer
appeared
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
with
some
retention
the
aroma
was
a
pleasant
sweet
malty
smell
the
taste
had
a
definite
german
tilt
to
it
as
expected
but
wheat
and
banana
reminded
me
more
of
a
kristalweizen
than
a
kolsch
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
but
it
was
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
decent
beer
and
one
that
i
would
get
again
but
may
not
be
my
first
choice
overall
a
decent
offering
a
good
starting
point
from
pilseners
for
the
uninitiated
good
for
summer
and
its
mostly
light
body
and
low
abv
make
it
a
good
session
beer
berkshire
makes
much
better
beer
but
this
is
a
decent
example
of
this
somewhat
obscure
at
least
in
america
style
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
aromas
of
light
grassiness
taste
begins
with
a
lemon
flavor
then
some
raw
grain
then
an
earthy
grassy
finish
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
tart
decent
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
overall
a
nice
beer
o
a
bit
of
a
letdown
definitely
needs
more
depth
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
profile
along
with
a
slightly
fuller
body
to
prevent
it
from
feeling
like
a
light
beer
would
probably
not
get
again
not
bad
not
one
of
bbcs
best
efforts
notes
a
great
summer
choice
id
take
it
over
their
czech
pilsner
bottle
pours
hazy
straw
with
a
small
head
nose
is
grainy
fresh
with
light
citrus
a
lot
of
fresh
grains
in
the
mouth
with
some
light
lemon
fluffy
texture
has
a
wheat
edge
to
it
very
crisp
i
guess
this
is
a
hybrid
alelager
or
something
and
it
comes
across
as
a
little
of
both
must
be
drank
fresh
of
course
but
a
really
nice
beer
in
that
case
drinkability
a
very
refreshing
ale
with
light
flavors
the
slightly
minimal
bitterness
creates
a
sort
of
spicyness
that
invites
you
to
take
another
swig
a
good
choice
for
a
warm
summer
evening
the
body
is
light
and
airy
almost
effervescent
in
terms
of
carbonation
poured
a
2
head
which
eventually
dissipated
completely
hazy
sandy
naples
yellow
color
smells
of
sweet
malt
flavor
is
not
sweet
in
fact
its
a
lot
like
most
bmc
mass
offerings
which
leads
me
to
say
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
which
happens
to
taste
like
many
others
youve
had
before
upper
average
pours
brilliant
clear
gold
with
fast
acting
white
foam
clean
smell
lemongrassish
taste
is
clean
crisp
smooth
some
citrus
at
the
close
flavorful
yet
simple
very
nice
extremely
drinkable
and
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
will
be
looking
for
this
beer
during
the
summer
for
sure
great
job
bbc
drinkability
highly
drinkable
with
a
great
balance
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
the
warmer
months
but
is
doing
me
just
fine
on
this
cool
november
night
good
summer
beer
would
drink
this
again
got
a
bomber
for
11
at
the
wild
colonial
in
providence
as
one
friend
pointed
out
it
does
smell
a
touch
like
feet
but
i
think
thats
mostly
the
mild
sulphurs
from
the
german
character
overall
its
a
decent
session
beer
with
a
lot
of
subtle
spicy
notes
as
the
beer
warmed
that
footlike
aroma
did
intensify
but
its
otherwise
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
id
rather
have
my
kolsch
have
too
much
spice
than
too
little
d
drinks
like
a
4
2
abv
beer
nothing
too
exciting
but
still
very
enjoyable
for
the
style
a
solid
goto
for
a
hot
summer
night
subtle
aftertaste
you
definitely
want
the
next
sip
this
is
a
light
refreshing
ale
with
just
enough
going
on
to
be
interesting
but
it
does
not
overpower
d
goes
does
easily
very
mild
kick
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
kolsch
and
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
very
drinkable
beer
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
kolsch
styles
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
beer
is
good
berkshire
has
been
making
fantastic
beers
and
this
just
proves
it
once
again
md
medium
carbonation
light
bodied
easy
drinker
could
easily
polish
off
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
extraordinar
though
gold
spike
ale
is
a
beer
that
you
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
on
a
summer
day
and
i
appreciate
the
low
alcohol
however
there
really
isnt
much
to
it
and
i
would
love
to
see
a
kolsch
that
has
slightly
more
expressive
yeast
and
maybe
just
a
dash
of
more
noble
hops
overall
a
solid
performer
from
berkshire
brewing
company
out
in
western
massachusetts
i
live
in
mass
but
t
have
never
had
anything
from
this
brewery
prior
to
this
brew
im
not
real
tempted
to
get
this
brew
again
so
i
might
just
want
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
from
massachusetts
draught
this
one
poured
a
clear
yellow
gold
color
it
had
a
fair
sized
white
head
that
left
a
bit
of
lacing
the

thanks
tim
medium

it
makes
this

from
a

perspective
i
find
this
less
of
a
draw
than
other
kolschs
ive
had
i
wont
refuse
this
if
offered
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
either
cheers

great
for

time
drinking
the

expected

beer
pours
a
pale
cloudy
straw

that
leaves

the
smell
is
pale
malts
with
some
lemon
and
straw
the
taste
is
light
with
a
nutty
dry
taste
followed
by
lemon
citrus
and
a
slight
hop
this
one
is
very
refreshing
the
nuttiness
is
a
little
watery
which
detracts
a
little
from
the
flavor
it
is
tart
yet
a
little
creamy
the
drinkability
is
great
with
it
going
down
smooth
and
easy
i
think
if
the
nuttiness
was
a
little
less
up
front
and
maybe
an
afterthought
this
would
be
better
i
like
the
tart
dry
finish
though
very
well
done
maybe
i
need
to
try
it
fresher
as
this
is
listed
as
summer
and
there
is
no
date
on
the
bottle
a
mild
clean
tasting
kolsch
with
an
equally
delicate
mouthfeel
that
provides
a
nice
balance

very
good

of
the

can

chilling
this

drinking
it

22oz

this
beer
was
a
hazy
light

color
with
a
nice

head
good
retention
and
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
was
an
appealing
blend
of
pale
malt
fruity
yeast
and
some
light
hops
the
flavors
started
out
with
a
lemony
hop
note
that
then
became
a
little
grassy
and
seemed
to
be
resting
on
the
pale
malt
backbone
slightly
doughy
and
slightly
bitter
the
body
was
mediumlight
the
carbonation
on
par
and
the
experience
generally
refreshing
nothing
great
but
a
fine
spring
offering
extremely
drinkable
like
a
light

a
bit
of
thickness

smooth
enough
absolutely
the
perfect

overall
this

a

beer
perfect
for

im
definitely
getting
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
refreshing
summer
beer
that
is
available
all
year
the
label
reads
that
it
has
a
soft
malt
character
and
a
low
hop
profile
and
its
spot
on
the
label
is
certainly
evidenced
by
the
aroma
as
it
has
an
near
indecipherable
maltiness
the
flavor
has
a
nice
bran
grain

malt
flavor
that
lends
to
an
exceptionally
crisp
dry

it

n

more
hops
than
i
expected
for
what
was
billed
as
a
kolsch
gives
it
a
fuller
texture
my
preferences
is
for
crispness
so
this
is
not
top
o
the
list
if
hops
is
your
thing
give
it
a
go
overall
drinkability
overall
its
an
okay
beer
nothing
amazing
but
its
not
a
kölsch
i
know
it
even
says
on
the
label
that
it
is
in
the
style
of
this
beer
but
no
its
not
maybe
an
american
blond
ale
or
even
a
lager
but
it
is
not
a
kölsch
easily
drinkable
but
i
would
want
something
different
for
my
second
glass
overall
this
isnt
something
i
would
try
again
or
recommend
if
you
were
looking
for
an
american
kolsch
cereal
sweetness
is
over
the
top
not
really
that
drinkable
especially
for
the
style
im
usually
a
fan
of
new
holland
but
this
one
is
a
miss
a
rather
inconsistent
beer
as
far
as
overall
quality
goes
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
pretty
decent
but
the
appearance
suffers
from
the
large
frothy
bubbles
in
the
head
and
the
head
quickly
fades
to
a
bare
wisp
the
mouthfeel
also
comes
across
as
rough
and
unrefined
not
bad
overall
but
far
from
being
a
goto
beer
for
the
style
floral
crackery
slightly
sweet
very
refreshing
there
is
a
bit
of
diacetyl
that
creeps
in
as
it
warms
floral
and
crackery
comes
out
in
the
flavor
profile
as
well
it
might
be
on
the
sweet
side
but
its
tough
to
nail
this
style
more
attenuation
would
help
t
sweet
wheat
right
off
the
bat
approaching
that
of
coors
too
much
virtually
no
noble
hops
flavor
slight
sulfuric
and
mineral
tones
set
it
apart
from
coors
and
lets
me
know
im
drinking
a
craft

better
examples
exist

the

glass
emptied
far
quicker
than
i
expected
not
very
complex
but
what
it
tries
to
do
it
does
very
effectively
o
a
superb
authentically
styled
kolschbier
this
one
really
nails
the
character
of

of

perfect

if

up
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
get
people
who
drink
macro
a
lot
into
the
craft
soon
really
pleasant
and
dead
on
with
the
style
meh
honestly
i
dont
even
go
through
the
categories
individually
its
a
decent
beer
but
thats
all
it
is
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
floral
with
a
bit
of
hops
the
beers
pretty
light
and
refreshing
but
theres
nothing
about
it
that
blows
my
mind
new
holland
is
supposed
to
be
an
outstanding
brewery
but
this
beers
just
alright
would
have
again
definitely
not
bad
for
the
2
i
spent
for
it
o
a
great
example
of
this
style
one
of
the
best
to
come
from
american
craft
brewer
d
not
bad
for
what
it
is
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable

nice
degree
of
sweetness

the
style
no
off
putting

pale
amber
color
with
not
much
of

scent
is
slightly
malty

but
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
uniquely
malty
it
starts
out
light
crisp
with
hints
of
citrus
but
finishes
kind
of
dry
and
chalky
a
pretty

there
but
not
much
it
has

and
a
dry
finish
new
holland
full
circle
is
a
decent
beer
a
little
different
but
typical
kolsch
recommended
overall
a
pretty
boring
beer
with
a
weak
flavour
and
smell
wont
buy
again
overall
kolsch
is
rarely
a
style
that
blows
me
away
however
new
hollands
enry
is
perhaps
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
to
date
the
beer
is
very
floral
and
there
is
a
distinct
breadiness
the
lightness
makes
this
an
excellet
beer
to
have
several
of
on
a
hot

day
nothing
overly

very

it

overall
its
an

for
a
fav
style
of
mine
this
isnt
really
anything
memorable
i
wish
it
had
more
of
a
bready
tasty
to
it
amendment
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
one
again
after
a
real
german
one
and
it
really
was
poor
in
comparison
o
worth
trying
but
not
for
me
definitly
a
solid
brew
though
that
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
has
a
good
backbone
in
malty
and
grainybready
flavors
and
its
nicely
carbonated
just
not
a
head
turner
but
solid
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
bright
golden
color
and
slightly
fizzy
smells
sweet
and
grainy
with
hints
of
white
grape
juice
and
honey
taste
leans
on
the
sweet
side
with
more
white
grape
juice
and
only
a
very
light
hoppiness
in
the
background
very
mild
drinkable
and
refreshing
feels
well
carbonated
wetting
to
the
palate
and
a
little
oily
slick
light
to
medium
in
body
nothing
like
a
pint
of
fresh
kolsch
right
from
the
source
one
of
my
favorites
of
this
style
but
then
again
i
have
rarely
had
this
style
on
tap
notes
drank
on
3202012
o
fresh
and
fruity
nature
nice
grain
base
good
session
material
easy
going
down
pronounced
with
a
sharp
clarity
of
flavor
nice
hop
addition
and
solid
by
example
makes
this
six
pack
worthy
im
not
sure
that
this
light
ale
competes
well
with
authentic
german
kolsch
but
compared
to
many
blonde
or
golden
ales
im
on
board
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
was
a
nice
and
unique
kolsch
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
this
style
so
i
really
dont
know
how
true
to
the
style
this
beer
is
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
that
beer
was
light
but
still
had
a
good
amount
of
flavor
to
it
that
made
for
a
pretty
nice
beer
to
drink
with
a
meal
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
and
seems
like
this
would
be
a
nice
refreshing
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
could
make
for
a
good
session
beer
and
i
wouldnt
rule
out
taking
out
a
six
pack
throughout
the
day
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
that
is
was
smooth
and
light
but
it
still
had
a
good
amount
of
nice
flavors
going
on
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
the
combination
of
biscuit
malts
hay
and
grassy
hops
really
worked
well
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
there
wasnt
really
anything
that
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
it
could
have
had
better
head
retention
but
that
isnt
that
big
of
a
deal
and
it
doesnt
warrant
a
drop
in
points
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
especially
in
the
summer
it
would
go
nice
along
with
oberon
for
a
good
refreshing
beer
to
quench
my
thirst
and
cool
me
down
in
the
summer
i
recommend
this
beer
for
someone
looking
for
a
light
beer
that
still
retains
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
if
kolschs
are
your
thing
then
this
beer
should
hit
the
spot
this
beer
was
just
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
i
tend
to
overlook
this
style
when
there
are
so
many
other
interesting
styles
on
the
shelf
but
i
think
i
should
give
this
style
more
attention
it
is
simple
clean
light
and
great
tasting
new
holland
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
and
i
see
why
this
is
one
of
their
main
beers
you
dont
have
to
have
in
your
face
flavors
to
be
a
great
beer
and
this
beer
does
a
great
job
in
proving
that
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
carries
some
fairly
light
malt
and
a
touch
of
straw
very
faint
hops
as
well
clean
and
crisp
in
the
flavor
with
a
bit
of
malt
light
body
with
crisp
carbonation
pretty
good
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
for
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
worth
having
a
little
cloudy
maybe
the
glass
but
otherwise
nice
and
easy
to
drink
would
grab
again
this
summer
4

d
i
used
to
think
very
little
of
the
style
this
beer
is
changing
my
views
o
spot
on
taste
feel
and
carbonation
true
to
style
while
the
brew
master
still
made
it
his
own
almost
missed
my
chance
to
try
this
guy
this
year
close
call
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
orange
peel
cracked
wheat
cardamom
and
light
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
fruit
coming
out
a
lot
stronger
and
the
cardamom
joining
in
to
ensure
that
balance
is
maintained
hell
it
even
seems
like
some
black
pepper
was
thrown
in
there
as
well
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
nice
kolsch
something
i
could
easily
see
drinking
during
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
necessarily
something
to
go
searching
for
overall
a
decent
beer
though
i
would
have
prefered
it
to
be
crisper
and
drier
kölsch
has
been
mentioned
more
than
once
as
being
the
germans
lawnmower
beer
while
america
cracks
open
that
standard
ice
cold
adjunct
lager
ze
germans
go
for
this
refresher
that
said
this
is
a
good
take
on
that
style
it
fills
the
criteria
id
want
from
a
yard
beer
but
it
has
character
i
like
the
minimal
usage
of
everything
here
like
a
blank
slate
for
just
a
bit
of
hop
to
surface
on
otherwise
a
light
beer
with
a
yeasty
note
while
i
wont
sing
its
praises
in
the
streets
ill
definitely
continue
to
choose
this
beer
very
light
slightly
sweet
fruit
flavor
with
a
mild
finish
i
did
detect
a
bit
of
spiciness
to
it
as
well
as
some
apple
and
pear
a
nice
refreshing
goodtasting
beer
but
for
a
beer
of
this
style
i
look
for
a
bit
more
winey
and
grapeyness
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
simple
sweet
and
has
a
nice
bit
of
grain
and
hops
this
might
be
the
best
beer
i
had
from
the
brewery
as
i
try
more
kolsch
style
brews
im
finding
theyre
as
varied
in
appearance
and
flavor
as
any
other
style
while
this
may
sound
obvious
until
recently
my
kolsch
experiences
had
been
singularly
uninspired
im
glad
to
find
better
examples
such
as
this
even
if
it
is
not
as
traditional
as
others
o
a
solid
attempt
of
replicating
a
german
favorite
of
mine
i
still
prefer
the
german
kolsch
of
koln
however
this
is
worth
a
try
and
is
an
interesting
u
s
take
on
a
classic
style
o
d
an
interesting
and
acceptable
kölsch
not
great
not
bad
worth
a
try
though
overall
very
refreshing
kolsch
that
is
among
the
best
i
have
had
great
summer
beer
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
very
light
yellow
color
the
head
was
fizzy
and
thinned
out
really
fast
there
wasnt
much
of
a
lacing
from
this
one
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
mostly
grainy
not
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
here
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
very
subtle
flavor
in
general
mouthfeel
is
very
light
as
well
with
some
decent
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
beer
does
fit
the
style
i
feel
these
are
good
summer
beers
o
this
has
a
good
base
but
my
favorite
kolschs
have
a
nice
dry
hop
to
them
overallnotes
solid
kölsch
ale
from
new
holland
doesnt
try
to
be
complex
and
leaves
a
satisfying
impression
perfect
for
a
hot
missouri
summer
i
think
ill
have
another
o
goes
down
easy
somewhat
tasty
not
filling
not
much
of
a
kick
ok
representation
of
style
ive
become
a
big
fan
of
the
kolsch
style
this
is
a
decent
kolsch
but
there
are
far
better
options
out
there
d
perfect
session
beer
what
a
treat
for
a
nice
warm
day
id
order
another2
and
ill
buy
again
very
good
kolschstyle
beer
alot
of
depth
to
the
flavor
and
wellrounded
refreshment
ill
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
a
kolsch
should
be
light
but
needs
more
character
than
this
better
examples
out
there
this
summer
im
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
between
the
huge
head
and
the
yeast
i
hope
floating
in
the
head
there
were
some
anomalies
but
its
a
nice
light
summer
brew
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
light
good
summer
beer
not
heavy
or
complex
easy
drinker
not
a
sipper
overall
a
drinkable
beer
which
displays
all
the
basic
kolsch
qualities
i
would
have
liked
a
more
subtle
aroma
profile
and
the
clarity
was
less
than
in
german
examples
overall
a
nice
light
beer
with
a
good
fruity
finish
definitely
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
cutting
the
lawn
if
anyone
who
reads
this
knows
of
an
american
brewery
that
does
a
spot
on
kolsch
please
let
me
know
d
it
goes
down
easy
even
if
im
not
too
sure
i
could
be
persuaded
to
drink
too
many
of
these
based
on
the
somewhat
unchanging
faintly
sweet
taste
still
an
interesting
opportunity
to
try
a
somewhat
obscure
style
and
definitely
worth
a
glass
drinkability
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
had
refreshing
qualities
if
you
are
looking
for
the
style
there
are
better
ones
but
this
will
suffice
verdict
disappointing
in
just
about
every
aspect
after
the
worker
at
my
local
shop
hyped
it
up
perhaps
i
got
an
older
bottle
that
didnt
age
well
very
bland
and
dull
this
needs
to
be
avoided
horrible
in
all
if
you
dont
mind
the
style
leeway
this
is
quietly
one
of
my
favorite
new
holland
offerings
from
notes
tasted
oct
2011
d
the
drinkability
here
is
good
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
warm
weather
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
overall
id
give
it
another
try
d
i
could
throw
back
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
a
good
representation
of
the
style
appears
a
golden
straw
yellow
with
a
cloudy
body
and
a
thin
paper
white
cap
little
to
no
lacing
and
only
a
thin
collar
of
the
head
remains
the
aroma
is
soft
grassy
hops
light
floral
aroma
and
lemongrass
on
the
palate
this
guy
is
almost
exactly
like
the
nose
full
bodied
for
such
a
light
beer
creamy
and
lush
with
high
drinkability
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
little
more
flavorful
than
most
which
is
highly
welcome
d
very
easy
to
drink
so
far
new
holland
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
with
what
ive
tried
they
know
what
theyre
doing
pours
nicely
into
beer
mug
with
a
golden
body
that
has
a
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
with
not
much
retention
and
very
little
lacing
with
light
carbonation
i
do
like
the
pleasant
sweet
smell
from
the
malts
that
are
in
the
beer
and
the
fruitiness
that
seems
present
in
the
beer
the
taste
is
a
slightly
sweet
soft
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
a
nice
soft
mouthfeel
and
the
soft
light
body
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
if
you
like
beer
with
a
low
malt
character
with
very
little
bitterness
but
i
prefer
beer
to
be
a
little
bit
more
bitter
myself
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
fruit
and
some
pepper
the
flavor
is
wheat
oranges
and
some
grassy
hops
the
fruit
is
the
most
dominant
flavor
i
dont
really
get
any
of
the
pepper
from
the
aroma
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
very
light
but
that
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
full
circle
is
very
refreshing
a
good
session
beer
new
holland
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
stellar
brews
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
pale
malt
with
a
slight
sweetness
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
milder
both
the
taste
and
the
aroma
lack
anything
in
the
way
of
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
even
for
a
kolsch
i
like
that
kolschs
are
light
in
bodied
but
this
beer
is
lighter
than
light
overall
this
beer
is
lacking
in
all
departments
i
will
not
be
drinking
it
again
d
compare
to
the
mbc
type
beers
this
is
great
but
falls
into
the
same
type
of
category
could
easily
drink
this
one
all
day
with
absolutely
no
issues
it
is
enjoyable
but
very
mild
would
be
something
i
would
not
mind
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle
d
a
drinable
light
beer
but
not
what
i
would
pay
for
from
a
micro
a
good
starter
beer
for
micronewbies
d
very
high
bottle
poured
a
light
yellow
color
beer
with
a
medium
pure
white
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
aroma
of
lightly
sweet
malt
with
light
fruity
ester
is
ok
taste
is
quiet
light
with
some
notes
of
lightly
sweet
malt
and
light
fruity
ester
and
not
much
else
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
ok
with
no
brewing
flaws
but
not
something
to
go
for
very
often
drinkability
its
okay
it
works
really
well
in
the
summer
as
being
a
drinkable
refreshing
beer
but
its
not
knocking
my
socks
off
meh
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
pretty
nice
for
a
summertime
sipper
pours
with
plenty
of
foam
forming
a
rocky
head
the
foam
takes
awhile
to
settle
down
smells
a
bit
grassy
touch
lemony
fairly
crisp
toasted
malt
character
with
a
bit
of
white
breadiness
very
grassy
bits
of
noble
hop
decent
bitterness
for
a
kolschstyle
ale
a
pretty
straightforward
beer
definitely
a
summertime
quaffer
d
had
one
of
these
after
a
long
bike
ride
hit
the
spot
a
good
springsummer
session
beer
not
bad
but
i
think
there
are
some
vital
yeast
flavors
missing
cheers
d
all
in
all
not
high
on
my
list
of
favorite
styles
but
i
could
see
this
being
a
geat
warm
weather
session
brew
d
good
but
this
beer
does
not
provide
enough
interest
to
me
to
return

this

is

enjoyable
exactly
what
a
kolsch
should
be
ive
enjioyed
this
beer
immensly
all
summer
long
this
is
a
good
beer
dont
let
the
urine
color
fool
you
this
pours
a
nice
yellow
gold
with
a
little
head
which
disapates
quickly
it
smells
of
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
dandelion

good

one
of
the
best
of
the

that
ive
had

bad
i
dont

all
that
much
d
highly
drinkable
despite
this
not
being
one
of
the
better
kolsch
beers
out
there
not
bad
just
not
very
inspired
would
make
a
good
hot
day
lawnmower
beer
though
d
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
again
overall
impression
not
the
most
exciting
beer
out
there
but
its
highly
drinkable
and
has
some
nice
flavors
taste
white
grapes
finishes
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
overall
very
impressed
once
i
started
to
drink
this
beer
mouth
is
rather
carbonated
and
fizzy
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
quick
crisp
finish
goes
down
pretty
easy
pretty
onedimensional
a
pbr
could
do
the
same
trick
at
less
than
12
the
price
drinks
quickly
this
style
is
definitely
in
the
realm
of
sessionable
md
thin
but
right
on
for
the
style
dont
drink
and
review
purchased
as
part
of
a
12
pack
of
new
holland
seasonals
a
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
brew
had
very
little
carbonation
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
only
a
few
lingering
bubbles
mouthfeel
is
mostly
smooth
which
in
my
opion
make
it
very
drinkable
in
warmer
weather
here
again
though
a
solid
beer
not
one
i
would
seek
out
to
drink
a
lot
of
i
am
not
going
to
lie
i
dont
care
for
new
holland
or
kolsch
beers
but
my
low
marks
arnt
based
on
those
two
facts
alone
this
is
just
a
marginal
beer
overall
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
the
typical
marco
lagers
but
is
much
more
flat
and
has
a
bigger
body
making
this
a
less
desireable
option
in
the
summer
heat
not
the
best
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
a
nice
crisp
clear
color
smell
is
light
malt
and
some
yeast
notes
the
taste
is
refreshing
with
some
malt
flavor
and
nice
depth
a
subtle
aftertaste
that
encourages
another
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
nice
flavor
balance
and
great
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
easy
to
drink
refreshing
for
the
summer
the
flavor
struck
me
as
somewhat
soapy
at
one
time
not
as
much
this
tasting
the
hops
are
somewhat
on
the
assertive
side
nice
bitter
bite
to
it
the
tiniest
bit
of
malt
tries
to
break
through
and
lend
something
else
grapefruit
but
maybe
comes
up
just
short
a
nice
dry
finish
though
crisp
and
clean
to
the
end
this
is
a
great
craft
version
of
the
mass
produced
beers
by
the
big
three
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
thin
white
head
of
mixed
bubble
sizes
doesnt
really
matter
since
its
not
around
long
no

at

figuring

out
a
good
summer
beer
we
had
this
while
sitting
on
the
back
patio
enjoying
some
nice
summer
weather
golden
color
with
big
malt
aroma
i
found
the
taste
to
be
very
malty
and
bread
like
it
is
crisp
and
nicely
carbonated
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
especially
with
food
and
on
a
warmer
day
not
a
huge
fan
of
kolsch
and
have
had
a
few
i
like
better
but
this
is
good
drinkability
another
good
summer
brew
would
be
a
good
session
beer
if
it
had
a
little
more
character
not
the
best
kolsch
out
there
but
its
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
either
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
drinkable
enough
as
a
style
but
theres
really
not
anything
drawing
me
to
this
beer
its
easy
to
drink
but
not
interesting
to
any
degree
and
thus
leaves
in
me
no
desire
to
continue
drinking
a
light

tames

im

poured
a
12oz

boulevard
smokestack
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
mellow
straw
with
a
2
inch
head
that
lacks
in
the
retention
arena
very
very
little
lacing
occurs
as
the
beer
recedes
just
a
thin
circle
of
head
sticks
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
grainy
with
fruity
esters
giving
away
notes
of
ripe
apples
and
sweet
berries
just
a
hint
of
floral
hops
comes
through
in
the
tail
of
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
just
as
straight
forward
as
the
nose
a
slight
grainy
appeal
comes
through
up
front
with
strawberries
weird
i
know
and
apples
a
bit
of
grass
and
just
a
wee
bit
of
yeasty
biscuits
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
leaves
just
a
faint
sweetness
on
the
palate
kolschs

people
would
really
appreciate
a

when
they
see
one

with

drinkability
is
top
notch
while
this
stuff
is
a
bit
pricey
its
certainly
worth
it
to
grab
a
few
and
drink
amongst
your
friends
this
is
another
awesome
new
holland
brew
and
im
looking
forward
to
more
in
the
future
this
is
a
great
summer
quencher
that
will
be
in
the
rotation
as
long
as
i
can
get
it
true
to
style
the
abv
is
well
hidden
poured
into
a
glass
for
a
tad
cloudy
yellow
with
good
carbonation
and
a
quality
head
picked
up
some
hoppy
notes
that
were
less
citric
and
more
akin
to
figsgrape
and
some
caramel
and
syrupy
malts
in
there
bittersweetness
this
beer
is
lightbodied
and
easy
drinking
but
damn
enjoyable
it
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
with
a
tealike
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
that
belies
a
sweet
fruity
taste
on
the
backend
and
yet
still
finishes
dry
and
slightly
smoke
from
some
roasted
malts
a
quality
beer
and
a
big
shout
out
to
that
bartender
for
that
recommendation
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
a
crisp
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
slight
lacing
aroma
was
a
bit
of
sweet
malts
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
surprising
blend
of
crisp
earthy
hops
sweet
malts
and
sweet
fruits
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
the
beer
quite
light
and
crisp
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
provide
nice
refreshment
this
one
was
surprising
one
i
would
definitely
have
again
cheers
typical
hint
of
lager
malt
in
the
aroma
light
and
delicate
like
the
quaff
just
a
bit
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
and
remove
any
sweetness
in
the
finish
a
decent
brew
this
would
be
a
nice
session
brew
in
the
summer
heat
the
kolschs
are
the
kissing
cousin
of
the
pilsner
lager
but
with
more
body
and
hop
bite
drink
up
poured
with
a
smallish
white
head
and
no
lace
until
i
tipped
the
glass
to
drink
and
then
not
a
lot
beery
grainy
grassy
aroma
taste
is
similar
but
i
also
picked
up
at
different
points
bitter
and
sweet
a
little
malt
bodys
a
tad
soft
very
easy
drinking
decent
finish
could
be
a
session
brew
not
great
not
bad
eh
light
amber
color
with
little
white
head
there
was
not
much
lacing
i
thought
is
had
somewhat
of
a
malt
smell
also
maybe
a
little
grainy
noat
a
very
overpowering
tasting
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
crisp
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
would
drink
again
this
is
very
quaffable
an
admirable
effort
in
brewing
and
well
worth
a
try
the
pour
was
nice
enough
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
nice
head
of
white
on
top
that
faded
gently
into
a
thin
veil
that
left
the
top
bare
after
just
a
few
minutes
light
bready
notes
and
some
grains
in
the
smell
a
bit
light
for
me
without
that
top
notch
banana
aroma
you
would
see
in
a
really
good
version
of
the
style
smooth
mellow
flavor
albeit
light
even
and
well
balaned
with
a
light
bready
note
and
a
touch
of
light
grassy
notes
towards
the
end
smooth
and
easy
drinking
as
this
one
went
down
effortlessly
into
the
night
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
solid
beer
for
the
hot
weather
i
would
imagine
final
thought
reminds
me
of
averys
15th
anniversary
ale
american
wild
ale
but
a
little
lighter
creative
effort
nonetheless
blipped
width
of
a
circle
by
david
bowie
d
a
good
session
brew
for
warmer
weather
good
stuff
for
putting
out
hotwing
fires
in
the
mouth
too
nice
refreshing
beer
great
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
certainly
one
i
wouldnt
turn
away
from
out
of
a
variety
case
from
shangys
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
it
can
disappear
quickly
if
youre
not
paying
attention
the
issue
with
it
however
is
that
its
a
bit
too
plain
i
might
wonder
if
the
brewers
used
a
tooclean
american
yeast
strain
instead
of
the
proper
german
one
theres
just
a
light
layer
of
wholegrain
bready
malts
with
a
hit
of
pepperyearthy
hops
at
the
end
not
a
lot
going
on
but
still
satisfying
and
drinkable
a
decent
summer
session
ale
i
suppose
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
small
white
head
subdued
aromas
of
honey
flowers
a
faint
grassy
hoppiness
light
on
the
palate
leaves
a
very
small
footprint
nothings
offends
lightly
sweet
hops
are
well
balanced
by
a
light
zestiness
its
remarkably
bright
and
crisp
and
goes
down
very
easy
this
beer
is
very
simple
and
yet
verges
on
perfection
with
simple
styles
like
kolsch
even
one
minor
flaw
will
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
nicely
done
this
would
be
an
excellent
warm
weather
beach
beer
d
like
most
kolsch
style
ales
this
is
very
easy
drinking
itd
be
great
on
a
warm
summer
night
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
tart
malt
grass
and
some
slight
nut
flavor
fits
the
style
of
a
kolsch
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
grass
up
front
then
some
tart
malt
the
hop
bitterness
is
in
the
background
and
a
strong
dryness
is
associated
with
each
drink
overall
a
fairly
typical
kolsch
a
very
pleasant
inoffensive
and
downright
drinkable
brew
a
sixer
of
this
on
a
hot
day
is
a
nobrainer
not
the
best
kölsch
ive
had
but
i
would
certainly
never
turn
one
down
ill
have
to
get
some
more
when
the
weather
warms
up
flavor
starts
with
a
bubbly
semibland
profile
before
giving
way
to
pleasant
notes
of
honeybiscuit
malts
bitter
hops
and
spiced
wheat
fairly
accurate
for
the
style
but
some
of
the
flavors
could
come
across
as
more
pronounced
in
my
opinion
spritzy
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
delivers
a
crisp
body
that
finishes
with
a
kiss
of
hops
and
metal
but
ultimately
smooths
things
out
dont
get
me
wrongi
like
this
beerbut
there
are
a
few
things
that
could
stand
to
be
hammered
out
to
allow
this
brew
to
come
full
circle
couldnt
resist
dthis
kolsch
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
tasting
great
overall
while
being
quite
appropriate
to
style
well
balanced
would
make
a
great
compliment
to
a
hot
afternoon
sitting
on
my
porch
pours
a
bright
and
clean
straw
yellow
could
probably
pass
this
off
as
an
undercarbonated
bud
to
someone
though
with
a
better
looking
head
and
long
lasting
retention
oh
yeah
but
it
smells
a
lot
different
it
smells
nice
an
clean
slightest
bit
of
mixed
spices
coriander
heather
and
cinnamon
are
the
most
apparent
then
comes
the
grainy
bready
goodness
not
really
any
hop
character
from
what
i
can
tell
though
this
changes
slightly
after
the
first
few
sips
beer
opens
fresh
and
clean
with
a
crisp
pale
malt
edging
its
way
across
my
pallet
then
the
beer
begins
to
open
up
a
nice
complexity
begins
to
develop
noble
hop
bitterness
tickles
the
tongue
ever
so
slightly
and
leaves
a
strong
vinious
finsish
that
lasts
until
the
next
sip
of
beer
washes
it
gently
away
i
think
that
this
beer
could
be
a
little
more
filled
out
has
a
bit
of
buttery
apple
taste
that
i
could
do
without
but
otherwise
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
to
mention
tasty
and
could
be
enjoyed
at
any
time
of
the
year
not
just
in
summer
or
on
thanksgiving
as
it
happens
to
be
today
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
beer
as
for
a
kölsh
it
seems
a
bit
aggressive
for
lack
of
a
better
term
to
describe
such
a
light
brew
but
is
tasty
nonetheless
pretty
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
on
a
regular
basis
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
plan
on
throwing
it
into
the
regulars
lineup
along
with
twohearted
and
brooklyn
lager
thats
how
much
i
like
this
i
could
drink
more
of
these
although
it
wouldnt
be
something
that
i
would
really
always
look
for
since
there
are
more
exotic
beers
out
therebut
it
would
definitely
be
something
that
i
would
recommend
to
others
d
this
beer
is
light
and
smooth
but
has
a
nice
balance
to
the
sulfury
notes
and
grain
and
hops
the
hops
have
a
nice
little
depth
to
them
this
beer
has
that
specific
kolsch
quality
that
i
cant
really
put
into
words
but
it
is
like
a
sweet
sulfur
note
which
most
attemps
are
lacking
d
good
beer
but
nothing
special
its
hard
to
measure
a
good
kolsch
because
it
is
such
a
simple
beer
d
fairly
well
balanced
in
flavour
but
maybe
a
touch
on
the
bitter
side
easy
drinking
d
an
exceedingly
drinkable
kolsch
lager
that
was
a
very
good
accompaniment
to
the
pepperoni
and
green
pepper
pizza
i
like
the
ontap
version
better
than
the
bottle
version
possibly
because
of
the
coldness
of
the
service
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
simple
and
satisfying
good
allaround
balance
and
taste
washed
down
food
just
fine
but
doesnt
really
stand
out
d
this
was
a
refreshing
kolsch
summer
beer
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
oelergud
light
to
mid
body
enough
carbonation
good
warm
weather
beer
could
do
session
might
drink
again
an
okay
beer
i
feel
this
one
didnt
have
the
smoothless
that
i
like
in
a
kolsch
and
it
seemed
a
bit
acerbic
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
is
one
ill
definitely
come
back
to
ill
take
it
over
any
other
kolsch
ive
drank
to
date
light
in
body
and
very
refreshing
this
one
is
one
that
goes
down
very
easily
semidry
finish
not
quite
as
dry
as
the
curve
ball
pale
straw
with
some
slight
haze
nice
thick
creamy

dissapates
quickly
thin
lace
circles
glass
pale
biscuit
malts
herbal
hops
and
slight
citrus
aromas
sweet
dry
buscuity
malts
dominate
upfront
some
light
grassy
hops
mingle
and
it
finishes
with
a
slight
citrus
note
the
hops
come
more
to
forefront
as
this
warms
liking
this
with
less
chill
carbonation
is
somewhat
subdued
light
and
crisp
on
the
palate
very
easy
drinking
perfect
for
this
evening
after
mowing
the
lawn
nicely
done
kolsch
drinkability
could
drink
a
sixer
in
a
night
easity
doesnt
wear
out
the
palate
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
drinkability
a
pretty
flavorful
version
of
the
style
overall
which
gets
a
bit
hoppier
as
it
warms
interestingly
enough
i
only
got
a
bottle
of
this
but
i
could
see
myself
buying
it
again
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
little

no

very
little

the
aroma

floral
hops
and
a
grainy
quality
has
a
light
taste
of
pale
malt
crackers
with
a
faint
bitterness
the
carbonation
seems
flat
with
my
sample
light
body
with
a
crisp
flavor
it
is
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
not
a
great
kolsch
but
a
respectable
effort
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
this
beer
doesnt
change
that
pretty
mediocre
overall
a
big
letdown
from
a
brewery
that
usually
doesnt
disappoint
this
1
just
has
little
to
no

avoid

is
a
bit
bland
with
some
very
dry
pilsner
malts
and
a
few
very
faint
earthy
hops
very
light
on
the
palate
with
a
brisk
hop
profile
just
the
right
thing
for
summer
a
pretty
decent
kolsch
that
drinks
well
enough
for
what
it
is
and
benefits
the
summer
weather
appearance
is
slightly
hazy
strawgold
with
a
rocky
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
lingers
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
has
some
awesome
noble
hop
but
german
malt
dominates
the
glass
same
for
the
taste
but
the
hop
and
malt
seem
to
dance
with
each
other
nicely
theres
some
mineral
quality
to
the
water
here
that
leaves
a
bit
of
a
carbonic
bite
on
the
tongue
but
its
not
overcarbonated
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
is
quite
refreshing
i
definately
will
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
not
bad
drinkable
with
some
nice
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
id
drink
this
again
if
it
were
available
full
circle
is
a
nice
springsummer
sessioner
could
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
especially
with
its
poundable
thinness
of
being
seems
quintessentially
summery
drinkability
this
beer
is
easily
enjoyable
when
you
want
a
refreshing
but
not
complex
beer
it
is
refreshing
better
than
many
but
not
quite
at
the
level
of
a
true
germany
pilsner
either
way
though
a
definite
beer
to
try
from
new
holland
d
not
bad
a
possible
session
brew
from
new
holland
worth
trying
a
peculiar
beer
but
ive
had
better
pilsners
ill
pass
on
going
full
circle
with
this
one
move
along
people
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
very
clear
goldenorange
with
a
huge
pillowy
head
that
leaves
nice
bits
of
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
is
primarily
of
hops
grapefruit
pine
and
juniper
taste
is
like
the
nose
with
a
smooth
malty
finish
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
velvety
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
given
its
light
body
and
smooth
character
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
best
pils
ive
ever
had
nice
job
new
holland
drank
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
on
it
pours
a
standard
pilsner
look
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
fresh
and
crisp
light
barley
citrus
and
floral
hops
nice
lightbodied
taste
with
good
hoppiness
the
single
malt
and
single
hops
really
come
through
and
i
like
it
fine
example
of
the
pilsner
style
taste
starts
sweet
and
travels
nicely
to
a
good
hoppy
finish
thin
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable

the

hay
and
lemons
left
in
the
bottom

are
elicted
on
the

a
surprising
whack
of
heavy
sweetness
and
certain
sourness
but
staying
within
the
lager
spectrum
i
have
to
give
them
points
for
providing
flavor
in
a
beer
this
shade
and
style
honestly
this
is
reminiscent
of
a
berliner
weisse
somehow
the
sour
patch
kid
tang
draws
a
breath
of
lemon
and
light
grain
there
are
no
infected
tones
or
offflavors
just
a
potent
sweetsour
attack
hops
are
too
laid
back
this
should
have
a
gentle
hopping
bite
to
balance
all
thats
left
on
my
tongue
is
a
distant

okay
in
some
level
of

theres
definately
some
errant

sharp

a

plenty

a
great
beer
to

after
a

a

sturdy
american

some
of
my

who
are

the

of

beer
were
really
digging
this
brew
and
i
found
it
refreshing
and
not

nice
local
made

sampled
12

the
pour
was
of
a
nice
gold
to
light
copper
color
capped
with
a
white
head
head
that
is
of
medium
thickness

leaves
a
beautiful

on
the
side
of

glass
as
it
disipates
nose
is
nice
slight
fruit
backed
up
by
straight
forward
malt
mouthfeel
is
dry
almost
instantly
flavor
is
of
malt
and
slight
grass
with
balanced
hop
very
crisp
clean
and
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
this
used
to
be
much
better
i
need
to
stop
buying
it
but
i
remeber
such
a
wonderfully
dry
pils
flavor
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
grass
and
slight
lemon
notes
followed
by
enough
hop
bite
to
give
it
balance
not
very
crisp
but
it
does
finish
clean
with
some
lingering
bitterness
the
mouth
is
a
tad
thin
good
session
brew
yet
another
fine
brew
from
the
folks
at
new
holland
brewing
company
keep
up
the
great
work
if
you
like
this
style
this
is
a
very
decent
effort
and
closest
to
the
pils
that
ive
had
in
microbrews
but
for
me
personally
id
get
a
pale
thanks
to
sopor
for
the
bottle
drinkability
is
very
good
the
light
appeal
makes
this
utterly
drinkable
and
the
taste
is
good
enough
to
justify
another
this
could
be
sessioned
on
by
most
mass
appeal
potential
given
the
current
big
market
brews
of
the
day
poured
with
a
huge
billowing
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
leave
a
nice
film
a
ton
of
cabonation
bubbles
in
this
clear
yellow
brew
smell
is
simple
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hay
taste
is
also
very
simple
but
not
bland
i
believe
this
is
the
first
single
malt
ive
ever
had
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
nothing
spectacular
but
also
no
flaws
mounthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
good
certainly
dosnt
live
up
to
pils
like
prima
but
also
not
a
bad
beer
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
with
a
white
head
that
disappeared
fairly
fast
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
some
saazlike
hop
notes
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
perfect
hop
addition
to
a
light
malt
flavor
good
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
with
moderate
carbonation
a
good
drinkable
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
small
head
that
left
a
very
nice
lace
sweet
and
citric
nose
the
flavor
has
a
big
snap
from
the
hops
with
a
nice
carmel
malty
sweetness
to
back
it
up
very
citric
grapefruity
hop
character
lasts
into
the
finish
nice
flavorful
pils
but
the
bitter
citrus
becomes
cloying
if
i
have
more
than
a
few
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
straw
color
with
a
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
light
coating
over
the
brew
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
there
is
a
light
malty
sweetness
but
what
prevails
is
the
spicey
and
crisp
hop
i
like
it
the
flavor
is
not
too
bad
either
very
spicey
from
the
hop
i
really
like
this
hop
ill
have
to
find
out
what
it
is
there
is
a
slight
graineyness
on
the
finish
i
enjoy
this
beer
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderatea
carbonation
i
could
see
myself
sitting
down
to
this
brew
after
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
it
would
quench
and
nice
well
above
average
on
this
one
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
is
gone
before
you
can
blink
leaves
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
grainy
with
a
little
spice
from
the
hop
smells
like
a
lager
flavor
has
a
solid
caramel
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
character
but
very
basic
the
body
is
light
but
not
really
light
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
beer
is
pretty
good
for
a
single
malt
single
hop
beer
but
its
just
run
of
the
mill
overall
cloudy
dark
apricot
with
slightly
sticky
head
fine
table
of
bubbles
stubbornly
remains
nose
is
pine
resin
and
grandmas
perfume
nice
combination
of
malt
and
hop
bite
on
the
tongue
really
coats
the
mouth
with
resiny
goodness
this
is
very
drinkable
sessionable
brew
pours
a
hazy
goldenstraw
with
a
nice
fizzy
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
flowery
and
grassy
aromas
bready
cracker
like
flavors
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
and
carbonated
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
and
bitter
i
must
have
gotten
a
really
fresh
bottle
this
is
a
damn
nice
beer
my
goshh
this
was
one
of
the
hardest
beers
to
pour
no
matter
how
slow
i
poured
i
just
got
this
massive
foamy
head
the
head
resembled
more
of
something
youd
see
from
a
ginger
ale
float
this
was
from
a
sampler
pack
but
every
one
of
the
full
circles
poured
this
way
having
this
massive
foamy
head
of
course
yielded
some
unbelievable
lacing
eventually
there
was
lots
of
carbonation
also
so
maybe
there
was
too
much
which
caused
the
excessive
head
anyways
the
color
was
a
medium
yellow
color
and
just
a
tad
cloudy
aroma
of
wet
wood
light
grassy
hops
yeast
and
that
common
pilsener
smell
taste
was
dominantly
hoppy
with
sweet
malts
coming
through
half
way
and
ending
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
and
somewhat
floral
mouthfeel
was
as
you
could
guess
foamy
i
like
the
beer
but
it
would
be
annoying
to
try
and
pour
another
theres
not
much
too
this
beer
so
its
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
this
would
be
a
great
crossover
beer
12
oz
bottle
obtained
in
a
trade
with
trbeer
in
december
2004
served

temperature

a
very
light
blonde
color
looks
like
a
macroswill
with
a
rich
and
fluffy
2
finger
head
that
is
nearly
clear
smells
of
an
earthy
hop
and
a
gentle
sweet
malt
soft
and
flowery
with
a
touch
of
honey
a
honey
flavored
sweet
and
clean
malt
flavor
carries
throughout
and
is
at
times
overrun
with
a
mild
hop
bitter
i
get
some
canteloupe
actually
i
think
its
called
muskmelon
you
know
the
melon
with
orange
flesh
the
hops
are
a
bit
rough
at
times
with
some
metalic
hints
in
the
aftertaste
an
interesting
play
with
the
mild
and
fine
carbonation
that
forms
on
the
tongue
and
the
light
body
some
lacing
has
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
glass
and
a
noticable
layer
of
pristine
fine
head
remains
a
bit
to
much
hop
bitter
for
me
to
drink

in

still

also

seems
to
be

a

lemony
hop
taste
is
nice
a
little
grassy
and
a
little
flowery
body
is
about

and
the
carbonation
is
fitting
pretty
decent
brew
as
far
as
a
pilsener
is
concerned
this
is
pretty
darn
good
but
i
dont
think
its
really
a
pilsener
ill
certainly
have
this
again
and
recommend
it
to
any
lager
drinker
looking
for
more
taste
zum
wohl
the
clear
golden
body
is
pilsener
all
the
way
as
is
the
nice
tall
head
of
white
foam
good
lacing
effect
from
the
substantial
head
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
saaz
hops
which
are
also
found
in
the
flavor
the
taste
is
nicely
robust
with
no
hints
of
adjunct
grains
being
noticed
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good

be
a
moderate

lowgravity
golden
lager
ale
with
a
decent
splash
of
leafy
and
floral
hops
thrown
in
for
ballast
its
clear
golden
body
and
thin
white
head
are
not
particularly
distinguishable
from
any
american
lager
or
european
pilsner
nor
is
its
aroma
it
offers
a
generic
beer
aroma
with
a
clean
combination
of
grainy
malt
and
sublime
hops
no
yeasty
esters
are
found
its
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
light
bordering
on
medium
body
and
finebubbled
median
carbonation
the
flavor
reveals
that
there
is
some
malt
present
and
apparently
little
to
no
adjunct
and
hops
are
represented
as
well
delicately
spicy
and
mildly
leafyherbal
in
taste
the
hops
balance
the
malt
exquisitely
and
even
replicate
the
flavor
of
some
very
decent
european
pilsners
im
not
sure
why
they
went
with
the
single
malt
branding
because
it
seems
to
be
coinfusing
this
is
a
very
well
done
europeanstyle
beer
its
really
well
balanced
with
a
good
malt
character
and
solid
hop
backbone
and
again
new
holland
delivers
an
excellent
session
beer
clear

with
a
big
white
head
of
foam
that
lasts
and
leaves
nice
lacing
aromas
of
fresh
saaz
hops
and
some
simple
malts
the
taste
is
bready
and
a
bit
malty
with
super
fresh
sharp
hops
as
well
the
aftertaste
is
reminiscent
of
biscuits
and
crisps
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
the
drinkability
is
awesome
a
fine
fine
pils
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
nice
pale
malt
scent
with
a
bitter
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
basic
yet
refreshing
pale
malt
flavor
and
a
citrus
hop
finish
that
tastes
a
bit
like
grapefruit
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low

beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good

its
light
and
has
decent

poured
a
very
happy
bright
and
sunny
yellow
in

with
a
fizzy
and
alltooshort
white
head
that
barely
manages
to
live
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
expected
grainlike
aroma
and
flavor
the

ingredients
dance
together
nicely
and
make
for
a

beer
for
outside
on
a
hot
day
hard
to
give
big
numbers
to
some
of
these
lighter
beers
for
look
and
smell
but
very
enjoyable
smooth
drink
but
very
meh
better
than
a
colors
lite
but
not
much
pretty
average
appearance
and
smell
but
is
pretty
dang
tasty
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
yet
gave
me
a
headache
crispy
and
tasty
one
of
the
best
domestic
kolsch
in
my
opinion
not
bad
at
all
i
say
o
i
see
where
the
name
comes
from
good
enough
beer
for
what
it
is
and
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
occasionally
cheers
tastes
like
your
traditional
kolsch
beer
very
smooth
compared
to
other
beers

this
rather
tasted
like
a
better
quality
aal
i
could
envision
this
being
an
excellent
craft
conversion
beer
but
its
nothing
id
grab
repeatedly
on
purpose
just
glancing
at
the
label
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
an
apashould
have
read
better
still
its
more
than
drinkable
and
refreshing
while
its
cold
this
is
nicely
crafted
clean
crisp
doesnt
try
to
be
bigger
or
bolder
than
it
should
be
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
those
who
actually
like
beer
if
i
were
in
southeastern
texas
immediately
after
cursing
life
for
putting
me
there
id
grab
some
of
this
good
stuff
this
is
good
beer
period
sa
makes
some
fantastic
brews
this
is
not
one
of
them
i
like
that
a
grassy
hop
bitterness
is
present
however
the
other
flavors
are
too
astringent
and
unappealing
to
make
it
a
beer
worth
having
fancy
lawnmower
beer
indeed
a
nice
session
ale
overall
an
ok
lager
kind
of
bland
low
c
a
very
solid
beer
with
a
nose
towards
the
hops
overall
kinda
watered
down
but
ok
i
mean
kolsch
is
a
real
light
style
so
dont
expect
huge
things
out
of
any
of
them
as
far
as
mind
blowing
complexity
or
anything
but
as
they
go
this
is
a
really
nice
one
light
and
drinkable
and
not
totally
boring
it
pours
clear
golden
as
you
would
expect
with
a
very
obvious
high
level
of
carbonation
millions
of
little
bubbles
race
eagerly
to
the
surface
and
pile
up
in
an
inch
of
white
head
it
smells
like
german
malts
light
and
easy
a
little
grassy
i
get
the
label
after
a
sip
this
is
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
hot
summer
day
lots
of
sweaty
yard
work
to
do
this
is
your
horse
if
founders
all
day
doesnt
work
for
you
grassy
finish
light
and
clean
refreshment
to
the
max
when
ice
cold
i
havent
had
a
lot
from
saint
arnold
but
what
ive
had
so
far
i
have
enjoyed
solid
american
made
kolsch
here
o
this
beer
would
actually
be
pretty
decent
if
it
had
more
flavor
i
guess
it
doesnt
put
up
a
front
though
since
its
clearly
meant
to
just
be
a
thirst
quencher
and
not
much
else
slightly
plain
on
the
appearance
and
smell
but
surprisingly
flavorful
overall
interesting
and
challenging
mouthfeel
refreshing
but
not
necessarily
compelling
like
the
saint
arnold
weed
whacker
better
but
this
would
be
a
good
goto
beer
for
a
group
that
might
have
a
variety
of
preferences
there
is
a
little
something
for
everyone
here
with
the
exception
of
the
maltlover
very
light
golden
color
with
a
sweet
smell
a
very
fizzy
fuzzy
mouthfeel
which
i
personally
dont
prefer
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
and
fairly
sweet
not
much
bitterness
here
and
the
sweetish
flavor
stays
in
the
mouth
for
quite
awhile
overall
a
reasonably
refreshing
beer
that
isnt
too
heavy
o
this
may
be
an
older
keg
due
to
lack
of
co2
and
the
slight
cardboard
flavor
based
on
this
sample
would
probably
pass
if
offered
again
its
very
good
beer
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
fair
head
and
some
slight
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
nose
is
light
and
bready
with
some
dried
grass
or
hay
light
hints
of
wheat
grain
and
citrus
zest
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
st
arnolds
does
a
lot
of
a
good
beers
and
not
a
lot
of
great
beers
its
appearance
is
straw
yellow
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
little
lacing
smell
is
slight
skunky
but
pleasant
taste
is
some
what
the
same
a
little
skunky
but
not
too
bad
feel
is
smooth
and
lighteasy
drinking
a
good
summer
drinker
just
like
the
name
implies
overall
this
is
a
good
summer
drinking
session
beer
and
like
all
st
arnold
beers
its
good
but
not
great
and
thats
pretty
good
hope
ive
not
been
harsh
or
faulted
lawnmower
for
being
truetostyle
overall
an
okay
beer
certainly
in
line
with
the
style
but
nothing
outstanding
here
nice
and
quenching
quality
in
a
pinch
in
texas
i
would
have
this
again
the
beer
is
clear
and
light
golden
with
a
pure
white
head
the
aroma
is
mild
offering
grain
slightly
sweet
a
hint
of
fruit
a
bit
of
toast
and
mild
sweetness
in
the
flavor
pretty
bland
but
a
good
chaser
for
washing
down
some
hot
wings
overall
a
solid
kolsh
that
would
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
o
easy
to
drink
as
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
flavors
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
definitely
sessionable
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
drinking
on
a
hot
austin
summer
day
especially
if
you
were
outside
doing
yard
work
i
enjoyed
this
one
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
in
abilene
at
h
and
h
beverage
not
a
bad
beer
tastes
like
a
hybrid
of
an
american
macro
and
a
kölsch
what
i
wish
american
macros
tasted
like
very
good
beer
but
not
the
best
in
the
style
by
a
long
shot
i
picked
up
a
6
of
this
because
it
was
on
sale
mistake
pours
with
a
moderate
head
that
persists
fairly
well
initial
nose
indicates
that
this
might
have
a
kolsch
taste
to
it
but
scents
can
be
deceiving
the
first
taste
is
surprisingly
disappointing
theres
a
strong
hint
of
corn
and
some
degree
of
bitterness
it
completely
lacks
any
bread
flavor
that
i
associate
with
a
quality
kolsch
rather
it
has
the
mouth
feel
of
an
american
lager
in
that
sense
its
clean
and
nonoffensive
and
definitely
a
pounding
beer
as
in
just
finished
mowing
the
lawn
in
texas
beer
i
hope
saint
arnolds
reformulates
this
with
possible
adjustments
to
the
malt
and
yeast
or
rebrands
it
for
what
it
is
along
with
a
steeper
price
reduction
because
a
good
kolsch
is
hard
to
find
as
is
its
disappointing
and
ill
be
avoiding
it
and
its
sidekick
weedwacker
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
the
color
of
pale
straw
with
a
tall
quickly
dissipating
white
head
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
theres
also
the
appearance
of
some
sediment
some
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
the
head
dissipates
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
yeast
its
a
very
basic
sweet
bready
smell
that
sweet
breadiness
from
the
yeast
and
the
malt
hits
the
mouth
up
front
there
are
some
minor
hop
notes
but
these
are
not
strong
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
high
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
perfect
for
summer
consumption
o
im
not
familiar
enough
with
kolsch
to
rate
it
to
style
but
i
dont
think
id
go
for
this
again
a
good
german
or
czech
style
pilsner
is
what
i
go
for
on
a
hot
day
and
there
are
plenty
of
hot
days
in
south
central
texas
this
beer
is
just
a
little
too
cloying
to
cut
through
the
heat
for
me
do
not
bad
for
a
light
beer
i
see
what
the
fuss
is
about
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
follow
this
up
with
another
without
blinking
this
is
a
great
refreshing
light
beer
choice
for
a
warm
springsummer
day
i
would
drink
it
again
quite
enjoyable
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
cool
spring
day
a
crisp
fall
day
or
just
about
anytime
definitely
recommend
this
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
tasty
brew
fancy
lawnmower
doesnt
leap
at
you
with
overpowering
tastes
and
smells
it
a
light
beer
overall
yet
has
enough
distinction
with
taste
and
mouthfeel
coupled
with
a
relatively
low
abv
to
make
it
a
respectable
session
beer
ill
be
buying
many
more
cases
of
these
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
ive
had
although
better
in
the
summer
than
in
the
wintertime
fortunately
in
the
brewerys
home
city
houston
its
essentially
summer
most
of
the
year
overall
good
easy
drinking
beer
3
55
o
its
an
ik
beer
i
dont
think
ill
ever
buy
it
again
overallgreat
alternative
to
a
fizzy
yellow
lager
very
drinkable
and
clean
kept
very
simple
and
well
done
bocce
othis
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
type
of
beer
it
was
better
than
i
had
expected
though
and
refreshing
o
good
summer
time
beer
would
probably
not
seek
it
out
but
its
worth
a
try
definitely
refreshing
o
this
is
definitely
a
beer
for
the
summer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
out
in
the
sun
less
watery
than
the
saint
arnold
summer
pils
but
somehow
more
refreshing
i
dont
think
id
pick
this
one
up
in
any
other
season
though
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
my
first
real
kolsch
i
enjoyed
the
style
for
what
it
is
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
enjoy
one
on
a
regular
basis
unless
its
100
degrees
like
it
is
now
then
it
tastes
great
overall
one
of
very
few
kolsch
styles
ive
had
so
difficult
for
me
to
rate
to
style
great
lawnmower
beer
i
suppose
hence
the
namesake
enjoyable
but
perhaps
a
bit
light
for
me
i
could
have
swore
i
reviewed
this
before
i
guess
not
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
that
left
a
lot
of
lacing
it
smells
mostly
of
biscuit
malt
with
butter
honey
grassy
hops
and
lemon
it
tastes
the
same
as
it
smells
very
mellow
flavors
of
malt
and
grassy
hops
it
feels
light
but
not
thin
soft
perfect
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
a
solid
beer
enjoyable
in
all
seasons
not
just
summer
this
beer
isnt
bad
its
just
not
something
that
im
particularly
a
big
fan
of
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
if
someone
offered
me
one
i
would
drink
it
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
wouldnt
be
my
first
pick
for
a
lawnmower
beer
though
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
style
profile
this
is
not
my
favorite
fizzy
yellow
beer
but
it
is
better
than
the
bmcs
i
definitely
like
the
other
saint
arnold
beers
better
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
4
0
d
good
lawnmower
beer
goes
down
super
easy
leagues
above
the
corny
taste
of
a
macro
but
not
much
flavor
overall
o
a
good
brew
to
keep
things
easy
im
actually
doing
this
as
i
watch
a
tabc
license
video
refreshing
and
a
summer
brew
dont
expect
to
knock
any
socks
off
though
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
gives
way
to
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
grassyness
and
grains
faint
and
very
hard
to
get
but
par
for
the
glass
the
taste
is
of
grains
and
grass
but
with
a
nice
sweet
fruity
touch
kinda
like
a
banana
or
a
sweet
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
was
a
little
more
flavorful
for
a
kolsch
than
what
i
have
had
in
the
past
the
fruitness
makes
it
stand
out
a
bit
this
is
a
very
light
and
refreshing
beer
o
a
great
warm
weather
beer
slightly
different
than
other
kolsch
i
have
had
but
a
great
beer
and
decent
representation
will
buy
again
and
recomend
a
slightly
hazed
light
yellow
with
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
collar
with
spotty
lacing
light
grain
grass
and
a
green
grape
nose
tastes
of
grain
and
faint
herbal
hop
with
some
sweetness
from
malt
showing
up
as
it
warms
thin
bodied
and
has
a
crisp
carbonation
i
generally
prefer
beers
with
more
flavor
but
this
is
a
great
hot
weather
or
after
using
the
lawnmower
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
viscosity
could
use
a
bit
more
carbination
for
a
crisper
feel
o
overall
i
didnt
think
anything
about
this
beer
was
extraordinary
at
first
sight
smell
taste
it
appears
simple
however
calling
it
simple
does
not
do
it
justice
this
simplicity
is
what
makes
this
beer
an
excellent
option
on
a
hot
day
or
against
the
many
lesser
quality
options
available
thanks
to
jayare46
for
this
one
decent
beer
subtle
but
also
interesting
depth
if
you
really
looked
for
it
overall
a
very
clean
kolsch
above
average
and
certainly
sessionable
on
a
warm
day
not
the
first
thing
i
would
reach
for
but
far
from
the
last
as
well
grassy
yellow
colored
with
a
low
white
head
that
settles
out
quickly
low
aroma
of
doughey
malt
and
some
corn
notes
flavors
fairly
match
the
nose
doughey
malt
and
mild
corn
notes
moderate
hop
bitterness
delicate
flavors
good
example
if
the
style
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
with
tingly
carbonation
followed
by
a
mild
pepper
spice
big
thanks
goes
out
to
optimator13
for
sending
me
this
one
in
the
small
aquatic
mammal
bif
11
served
from
bottle
into
a
mother
earth
strange
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
three
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
almost
instantly
mainatined
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
grass
clippings
and
skunk
hop
the
flavor
was
sweet
malt
wheat
skunky
hop
and
slight
nutmeg
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
but
it
wasnt
too
aweinspiring
i
found
it
odd
that
grass
clippings
showed
up
in
the
aroma
though
but
i
guess
it
was
only
fitting
i
usually
prefer
hefes
when
i
mow
my
lawn
but
i
could
see
me
firing
up
the
turbo
lawnmower
with
this
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
rjt
easy
to
drink
and
while
not
perfect
a
likeable
beer
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
with
a
double
finger
of
foamy
white
head
smells
like
stale
bread
with
a
bit
of
stale
sweet
malts
and
corn
and
some
stale
hops
this
beer
might
be
stale
but
no
date
on
the
bottle
so
who
knouse
ws
taste
is
fizzy
bland
and
bland
the
24
oz
can
of
genny
cream
ale
i
opened
after
this
has
more
flavor
i
want
to
like
this
because
i
have
enjoyed
other
beers
from
st
arnold
but
i
dont
i
also
dont
mow
my
lawn
so
maybe
im
out
of
my
element
here
p
s
mine
is
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
sa
d
great
all
around
brew
a
nice
one
to
work
with
good
sessionable
taste
and
abv
mouthfeel
is
light
very
clean
and
crisp
during
the
summer
this
would
be
super
drinkable
but
right
now
not
so
much
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
little
bland
beer
is
a
pale
golden
in
color
the
head
though
doesnt
last
too
long
but
has
good
body
im
not
seeing
any
lacing
looks
refreshing
the
nose
is
floral
with
some
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
grains
in
the
taste
you
get
the
floral
hops
upfront
with
subtle
hint
of
wheat
bitter
grasses
and
some
oats
in
the
background
hops
are
dominant
mouth
feel
is
clean
and
light
bodied
with
bubbly
carbonation
this
beer
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
perfect
for
mowing
the
lawn
very
drinkable
stuff
here
well
as
far
as
american
kolsh
goes
this
is
pretty
darn
good
i
love
the
name
and
it
is
very
appropriate
for
the
style
a
kolsh
is
so
great
for
a
summer
day
and
so
much
better
than
most
lawnmower
beers
this
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
hops
the
taste
makes
me
wish
for
a
hot
sunny
day
very
refreshing
the
grains
hops
and
efverescent
carbonation
make
this
a
great
summer
day
beer
it
sure
beats
the
hell
out
of
budweizer
light
to
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
very
crisp
refreshing
enough
that
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
would
be
nice
extremely
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
like
the
name
says
this
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
to
grab
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
aptly
named
i
can
certainly
see
several
of
these
going
down
quite
nicely
on
a
summer
day
clean
malt
flavor
with
minimal
hopping
a
light
citric
note
intertwines
vague
grassy
touches
reminds
me
of
an
old
school
pils
back
when
the
macro
brewed
made
stuff
that
at
least
tasted
like
beer
overall
fairly
basic
kolsch
not
too
much
flavors
but
i
didnt
expect
a
lot
taste
is
better
than
the
nose
probably
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
very
much
of
much
better
kolshs
out
there
nice
enough
innocuous
beer
lots
of
better
kolsches
out
there
d
yeah
you
can
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
beers
only
limiting
factor
on
drinkability
is
the
carbonation
lots
of
gas
very
drinkable
d
crisp
and
refreshing
a
bit
more
flavor
and
a
lot
more
character
than
a
lot
of
beers
this
would
draw
comparisons
to
not
quite
a
kolsch
but
a
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
down
nonetheless
light
refreshing
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
balanced
hops
has
a
slight
green
tint
great
from
the
tap
or
in
the
bottle
perfect
for
hot
summer
days
when
you
need
to
cool
off
after
some
yard
work
ive
had
this
straight
from
the
beer
hall
in
st
arnolds
beer
hall
it
doesnt
get
any
fresher
than
that
id
never
turn
one
of
these
down
lawnmower
beer
is
right
its
light
refreshing
and
low
in
alcohol
yet
it
doesnt
sacrifice
flavor
like
the
american
light
lagers
perfect
for
this
time
of
the
year
d
overall
strong
drinkability
for
those
hot
texas
summer
days
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
strike
a
pretty
good
balance
between
the
lighter
summer
offerings
like
pilsners
and
the
sometimes
cloying
hefeweisens
i
could
and
have
been
known
to
finish
off
an
entire
sixpack
in
one
sitting
feel
the
beer
wasnt
light
and
overly
refreshing
but
not
to
the
extent
that
it
could
be
called
a
heavy
beer
it
was
a
little
stickier
than
i
would
have
liked
since
a
little
more
dryness
would
have
complemented
the
flavors
well
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
wanted
to
stock
their
cooler
with
something
refreshing
and
drink
outside
on
a
hot
day
d
the
flavor
of
this
is
not
quite
as
bad
as
the
aroma
but
the
smell
of
this
beer
just
makes
you
not
want
to
even
try
to
drink
it
anymore
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
the
best
but
is
a
perfect
beer
for
hot
texas
summers
this
brew
also
has
more
flavor
overall
than
many
of
the
lawnmower
beers
people
may
have
in
their
fridge
and
it
has
a
better
flavor
overall
recommended
for
a
good
tasting
or
at
least
as
a
good
summer
refresher
medium
bodied
and
fuller
than
i
expected
with
a
nice
crisp
hop
bite
up
front
that
provides
a
nice
dry
bitterness
which
is
balanced
out
by
pale
malts
grass
straw
and
light
apple
and
pear
notes
well
balanced
and
very
quaffable
especially
in
the
hot
ass
weather
down
here
drinkability
it
was
85
degrees
i
was
outside
very
refreshing
and
easydrinking
a
great
beer
after
you
get
done
mowing
the
lawn
notes
not
necessarily
identifiable
as
a
kolsch
but
it
doesnt
mess
it
up
either
just
tastes
like
a
clean
light
lager
could
be
a
pilsner
but
no
hops
d
an
enjoyable
beer
quite
sessionable
and
refreshing
good
with
light
meals
american
food
or
pubfare
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
although
id
like
a
crisper
differentiation
in
flavors
the
hops
seem
to
run
into
the
malt
flavors
instead
of
working
with
them
still
an
easydrinker
and
its
worth
a
shot
served
chilled
with
a
medium
pure
white
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
of
fresh
grain
and
a
hint
of
yeast
taste
is
surprisingly
light
malty
up
front
with
a
yeasty
middle
and
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
was
good
low
carbonation
good
drinkability
a
nice
simple
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
formed
a
12
bright

above
the
clear
golden

head
falls

with

lightly

with

somewhat

taste
starts
with
pale

light
bitterness
in
the
middle
creamy
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
soft
over
the

drinkability
is
good
name
fits
purpose
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
decent
flavors
its
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
and
would
be
a
good
alternative
to
a
macro
but
its
not
really
something
that
really
excited
me
much
d
goes
does
quite
easily
not
a
great
representation
of
the
style
however
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
enjoyed
a
few
pints
of
d
lightish
mouthfeel
taste
lend
well
to
easy
drinking
arrived
with
a
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
light
pale
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
pleasant
lagerlike
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
honeylike
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
soft
slightly
dry
and
definitely
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
indeed
the
beer
isnt
all
that
bad
despite
the
negative
comments
i
expect
a
lot
out
of
a
kolsch
and
this
beer
would
make
a
better
example
of
a
cream
ale
thanks
exiled
very
good
beer
two
good
kolsch
in
a
row
are
beginning
to
turn
me
on
to
a
style
i
havent
dug
too
much
until
now
well
done
saint
arnold
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
with
a
light
fish
or
chicken
meal
d
maybe
not
hi
quailty
stuff
but
super
drinkable
maybe
thats
what
they
werer
trying
for
this
would
make
a
good
beer
to
drink
by
the
sixer
way
better
than
the
ricebased
macros
final
thoughts
its
pretty
refreshing
and
light
but
has
some
interesting
creamy
banana
yeasty
vanilla
yogurt
like
flavors
and
has
a
slightly
spicey
saison
like
feel
but
maintains
a
bavarian
hefe
style
taste
its
strange
for
a
kolsh
style
but
has
a
few
interesting
characteristics
drinkability
loved
it
heading
back
to
texas
soon
to
stuff
some
more
in
my
suitcase
its
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
states
or
probably
texas
but
hit
the
spot
when
i
drank
it
and
thats
all
i
cared
about
i
think
ill
get
it
on
tap
next
time
hope
it
doesnt
let
me
down
pours
out
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
heaqd
no
lacing
not
much
of
a
scent
but
what
there
is
of
green
hops
the
taste
is
rather
plain
but
well
balanced
for
what
is
there
which
makes
the
drinkablity
not
bad
this
as
with
most
kolsch
beer
make
for
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
texas
summer
day
d
if
you
are
outside
in
the
houston
heat
this
should
be
in
at
least
one
of
your
hands
drink
ability
is
pretty
good
very
session
able
great
simple
beer
a
good
substitute
for
a
light
beer
but
with
more
flavor
overall
did
not
disappoint
me
it
was
pretty
much
what
i
expected
clean
on
the
palate
and
an
easy
drinker
very
nice
on
a
hot
tx
summer
day
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
lead
into
a
nice
ipa
or
iipa
later
in
the
night
body
is
slightly
sweet
with
creamed
corn
and
vegetable
husks
finishes
with
a
burst
of
grassy
floral
hops
and
crisp
clean
bready
malts
each
sip
bubbles
profusely
adding
some
zip
to
the
body
that
lightens
it
as
well
goes
down
easily
i
could
put
away
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
setting
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
solid
summer
session
beer
but
ive
definitely
had
better
kölschs
than
this
good
job
saint
arnold
mouthfeel
drinkability
arent
that
bad
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
with
nice
carbonation
and
slight
watery
mouthfeel
that
weird
corn
aftertaste
kind
of
disappoints
if
the
hops
were
amped
up
a
bit
this
would
be
a
really
great
beer
i
dont
know
if
this
is
exceptionally
fresh
or
just
a
remarkably
well
brewed
kolsch
im
fall
into
the
same
trap
as
most
other
bas
in
that
i
normally
dont
give
strong
scores
to
lighter
flavored
beers
but
this
one
is
done
very
well
d
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
and
just
as
the
name
denotes
its
just
right
for
mowing
the
lawn
in
a
hot
texas
day
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
light
golden
color
with
a
bubblyfluffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
smells
fruity
with
apples
and
lemons
coming
to
mind
grassy
grainy
slightly
malty
taste
is
grainy
and
fruity
carbonation
level
is
high
it
pierced
the
tongue
with
every
sip
body
is
light
an
quite
quaffable
mouthfeel
sweet
lightly
syrup
and
malty
great
hot
weather
drinker
here
just
enough
sweetness
light
body
just
great
excellent
beer
great
for
summer
d
most
pale
beers
tend
to
have
a
skunky
aftertaste
to
me
this
beer
is
not
necessarily
an
exception
but
on
the
very
lowest
end
of
the
spectrum
i
could
drink
these
all
day
and
not
complain
a
bit
about
it
it
will
drink
better
when
cold
but
is
still
very
drinkable
as
it
warms
something
i
cannot
say
for
any
other
beer
that
i
know
thats
even
close
to
this
fancy
lawnmower
beer
is
the
sort
beer
that
bmc
could
and
should
be
brewing
not
the
best
kolsch
ive
had
but
id
reach
for
this
in
a
quick
minute
during
a
hundredodd
degree
texas
heatwave
recommended
finally
a
beer
that
is
marketed
to
the
lawnmowing
crowd
i
have
a
lawn
man
but
im
still
down
with
lawnmowers
the
one
on
the
front
looks
like
a
toro
i
used
to
have
pours
a
murky
gold
which
clears
around
the
edges
one
and
a
half
fingers
of
white
head
dissipates
quickly
settling
into
a
thin
layer
on
top
and
leaving
a
fine
sheet
of
lace
smells
of
sweet
hops
mixed
with
some
hops
and
subtle
light
fruits
tastes
of
more
sweet
malts
a
little
honey
and
a
faint
bit
of
spice
hops
arent
really
noticeable
but
the
brew
remains
fairly
tasty
goes
down
easy
and
is
well
carbonated
the
word
refreshing
comes
to
mind
and
id
say
this
would
make
an
excellent
summer
brew
to
take
on
an
outing
or
such
they
should
can
this
one
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
head
comes
up
and
out
of
the
glass
and
then
is
gone
in
seconds
leaving
no
lacing
down
the
side
citrus
notes
in
the
nose
but
nothing
overwhelming
quite
lemony
at
first
then
kind
of
trickles
off
into
a
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
quite
smooth
i
could
drink
the
mess
out
of
this
although
im
glad
i
only
got
one
from
a
mixed
sixer
but
im
really
glad
i
tried
it
on
the
whole
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
doesnt
really
match
up
stylistically
with
other
kolsch
biers
ive
had
but
its
not
a
bad
effort
especially
in
the
nose
this
beer
really
shines
a
totally
drinkable
lawnmower
brew
a
fancy
lawnmower
brew
in
fact
i
can
think
of
few
brews
id
rather
celebrate
the
growth
of
summer
grass
with
more
than
this
one
cheers
drinkability
was
great
the
moderate
abv
and
cool
refreshing
qualities
would
make
this
great
for
a
warm
outdoor
party
drinks
easy
nough
a
few
will
hit
the
spot
on
a
warm
day
to
be
sure
fairly
spot
on
for
the
style
coming
from
a
rural
texas
setting
this
beer
brought
back
memories
of
sitting
out
in
the
country
it
doesnt
look
unlike
a
thicker
version
of
a
bmc
but
its
typical
it
has
a
popping
white
head
think
sprite
smells
and
tastes
almost
like
a
wheat
beer
but
not
quite
i
pick
up
grains
like
corn
and
wheat
the
nose
also
reminds
me
of
hay
and
alfalfa
fields
back
home
the
mouth
is
lively
and
carbonated
and
it
seems
to
fit
the
beer
well
low
abv
no
strong
flavors
make
this
extremely
drinkable
d
its
swillable
but
really
im
wondering
if
i
have
a
bad
bottle
this
beer
tastes
so
much
of
corn
that
it
really
reminds
me
of
coors
light
and
some
other
not
too
tasty
macros
hopefully
thats
not
the
intention
of
the
brewers
but
i
suppose
with
a
beer
thats
meant
to
be
drank
after
mowing
the
lawn
maybe
thats
what
they
were
going
for
who
knows

extremely

in

brew
the
grassy

really
makes
it
an
unbearable
beer
drinkability
its
crisp
clean
and
quite
drinkable
though
i
could
personally
do
with
just
a
small
bump
in
hop
bitterness
i
ultimately
found
it
to
be
a
quality
kölsch
light
cereal
graininess
sligth
and
i
mean
very
slight
noble
hop
bitterness
where
this
beer
defines
itself
like
most
beers
seem
to
is
in
the
taste
bright
crisp
and
clean
honey
sweet
maltiness
with
a
slight
floral
hop
edge
mouthfeel
is
snappy
this
is
where
the
hops
are
most
noticeable
maybe
just
the
slightest
bit
of
adjunct
taste
i
mean
i
cant
say
for
sure
if
they
are
using
adjuncts
but
there
is
a
slight
corny
sweetness
to
this
beer
im
not
saying
its
bad
but
its
a
taste
that
i
am
not
all
that
used
to
tasting
there
is
a
slight
spiciness
here
as
well
and
covers
up
just
a
bit
the
corny
sweetness
in
this
beer
i
think
that
full
circle
has
this
one
beat
but
still
a
very
nice
very
drinkable
beer
not
bad
this
was
light
but
still
fairly
flavorful
and
crisp
drinking
definitely
the
best
lawnmower
beer
that
ive
had
in
a
while
id
grab
one
in
an
instant
on
a
hot
day
d
very
drinkable
would
be
great
for
a
session
beer
and
just
one
to
kick
back
when
having
a
cold
one
after
a
day
of
work
overall
a
beer
that
serves
its
purpose
and
by
no
means
a
bad
brew
good
but
not
at
all
great
tastes
pretty
good
too
best
described
as
cutting
open
a
mild
poblano
pepper
and
licking
the
dark
green
flesh
has
a
floral
spicy
finish
and
is
quite
dry
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
while
maintaining
a
high
level
of
flavor
this
is
a
well
done
kolsch
i
can
see
why

make
a
great
umm
summertime
lawnmower
beer
thanks

of
my
favorite

crisp
and
tasty
german
ale
thats
highly
drinkable
the
aroma

sourdough
notes

bit
of
citrus
character

flavor
has
a
mix
of
dry
biscuit
malts

very
nice
year
round
offering
from
a
fantastic
brewery
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
highly
enjoyable
especially
on
those
final
hot
summer
weeks
before
the
temps
start
to
drop
and
it
becomes
stout
season
yum
drinkability
was
okay
i
finished
the
beer
but
wouldnt
search
for
more
of
these
there
were
too
many
other
good
beers
by
the
same
brewer
even
for
me
to
search
out
more
of
these
id
drink
it
again
though
m
feels
and
drinks
like
a
light
beer
with
some
viscous
quality
to
it
d
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
nont
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
but
not
the
best
wouldnt
pass
it
up
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
pours
out
a
slightly
orange
hue
with
a
bit
of
a
haze
the
head
is
white
and
minimal
the
aroma
is
of
untoasted
malt
and
slightly
of
hops
nice
and
clean
traces
of
lemon
its
a
very
subtle
beer
nothing
over
the
top
maybe
even
a
little
dissapointing
d
this
beer
ha
a
nice
aroma
but
it
is
very
light
even
for
the
style
and
the
flavor
is
to
clean
i
like
the
flavors
but
i
just
wanted
them
to
be
a
bit
more
pronounced
the
perfect
summer
beer
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
during
a
hot
summer
day
it
does
not
get
much
better
than
this
not
sour
enough
and
not
cloudy
at
all
but
full
flavored
for
beer
of
this
light
yellow
color
i
think
that
this
one
wanted
to
be
served
with
a
slice
of
orange
or
at
least
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
to
my
outher
2
this
is
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
buy
this
one
if
it
was
avalabule
in
my
area
drinkability
is
very
nice
easy
drinking
and
quenching
a
great
summer
beer
for
scorching
days
poured
a
a
light
orange
maybe
e
deeper
yellow
average
carbonation
with
a
small
white
head
the
graniy
grassy
and
fruity
with
little
bit
of
hops
is
the
best
way
i
can
describe
the
taste
a
very
small
bite
at
the
end
from
the
hops
but
a
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
a
kolsch
as
noted
here
im
having
a
hard
time
but
as
a
pleasant
hot
wether
summer
beer
it
works
sometimes
why
ask
why
snifter
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
color
white
head
with
low
retention
and
low
lacing
slight
grassy
aroma
could
just
be
the
name
playing
tricks
on
me
corn
malts
off
the
bat
very
light
malts
no
big
hop
aromas
nice
sweet
citrus
malt
flavors
very
light
though
tons
of
corn
malts
no
distinct
hop
flavors
low
to
medium
body
solid
carbonation
level
very
easy
to
drink
nice
and
mild
great
lawnmower
beer
haha
overall
i
have
to
say
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
nice
little
light
summer
ale
i
would
have
no
issue
with
drinking
this
one
again
and
in
a
good
quantity
to
as
its
name
implies
this
would
be
excellent
while
mowing
the
lawn
poured
into
standard
pint
glass
cloudy
golden
color
with
one
finger
thick
white
head
quickly
dissipates
with
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
very
interesting
something
sweet
could
be
honey
light
spice
aromas
reminding
me
of
my
fave
kolsch
dragonmeads
kaisers
kolsch
nothing
stands
out
in
the
taste
there
isnt
any
kind
of
sweetness
in
that
taste
lacking
in
body
this
is
where
this
one
separates
from
dragonmeads
its
a
very
sessionable
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
name
no
doubt
but
doesnt
stand
out
in
the
taste
field
and
thats
what
is
most
important
right
cloudy
yellow
pour
with
thick
dirty
white
head
smells
like
coors
light
sorry
i
know
that
stings
taste
is
masked
by
a
way
over
carbonated
mouthfeel
i
guess
through
all
that
carbonic
acid
is
sweet
floral
flavor
with
some
citrus
hops
are
there
but
its
just
not
worth
finding
them
all
the
bubbles
keep
getting
in
the
way
all
i
taste
is
beery
soda
water
very
pale
cloudy
light
yellow
with
a
thick
sticky
white
head
i
smell
mainly
grassy
hops
with
some
floral
as
well
i
taste
floral
soapy
hops
with
some
grassy
notes
and
stingyness
throught
there
is
a
hint
of
bready
malts
as
well
thee
is
a
nice
lasting
flavor
well
after
the
finish
this
is
very
light
in
body
and
super
easy
drinking
not
too
bad
an
easy
summer
beer
but
the
co2
seems
to
be
entirely
too
dominant
this
is
beer
that
i
could
definitely
drink
a
lot
of
on
a
hot
summer
day
plus
here
in
texas
i
can
get
a
six
pack
for
just
a
dollar
or
two
more
than
a
macro
six
out
at
the
pool
i
cant
think
of
a
better
option
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
saint
arnold
brews
md
medium
bodied
and
highly
carboanted
very
easy
drinking
beer
d
ive
never
been
a
kolsch
fan
that
being
said
this
was
refreshing
and
might
make
me
rethink
any
preconceived
notions
d
easy
beer
to
enjoy
nothing
that
is
to
extreme
most
people
could
enjoy
this
beer
overall
a
nice
solid
kolsch
that
i
could
drink
on
any
hot
day
nice
little
beer
this
would
be
the
perfect
beer
to
down
a
couple
of
after
mowing
the
lawn
a
nice
summer
beer
that
would
pair
nicely
with
some
grilled
fish
i
think
after
a
hot
sweaty
day
in
austin
this
beer
was
a
welcome
treat
16
oz
pint
poured
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
eventually
dissipated
leaving
some
lacing
somewhat
hazy
appearance
this
beer
is
delicate
all
around
as
is
the
kölsch
style
slight
lemony
aroma
and
crisp
malt
flavor
with
a
clean
citrus
finish
very
light
yet
balanced
high
drinkability
due
to
the
lighter
body
and
lower
alcohol
d
an
excellent
example
of
a
kolschstyle
easy
to
knock
back
some
of
these
on
a
nice
summer
day
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
beer
is
exactly
what
the
name
implies
light
refreshing
and
well
worth
pounding
down
for
a
long
time
saint
arnold
fancy
lawnmower
is
a
pretty
good
warm
weather
kolsch
that
should
be
more
popular
down
in
texas
than
shiner
bock
but
probably
isnt
for
that
matter
it
should
sell
better
than
everything
brewed
by
bmc
but
probably
doesnt
i
enjoyed
this
one
under
the
cap
make
beer
not
war
this
is
a
decent
spring
time
beer
with
its
easy
quoff
da
nice
representation
of
style
also
a
beer
with
the
perfect
name
certainly
one
i
would
grab
after
mowing
the
lawn
pours
a
bright
clear
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
settles
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
slow
but
steady
carbonation
bubbles
smells
faintly
of
grassy
grains
taste
is
faint
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
buttery
very
moist
finish
fairly
clean
drinkable
simple
kolsch
this
beer
poured
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
a
grainy
wheat
smell
the
taste
was
again
a
grainy
crisp
taste
with
low
hop
taste
very
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
beer
doesnt
pretend
to
be
anything
than
what
it
is
intended
for
mowing
the
lawn
it
is
very
refreshing
which
is
perfect
for
just
such
an
event
i
think
it
hits
the
mark
as
a
very
good
kolch
style
beer
d
just
like
the
name
says
its
a
fancy
lawn
mower
beer
perfect
for
when
you
want
a
beer
thats
cold
and
wet
its
not
going
to
blow
you
a
way
but
its
still
a
good
beer
d
try
as
i
might
this
was
waaay
too
easy
to
drink
im
guessing
no
more
than
5
or
6
sips
was
all
it
took
to
finish
the
glass
light
perfect
for
summer
warmth
would
have
this
all
the
time
between
july
october
if
available
in
portland
i
had
this
on
tap
during
a
tour
of
the
saint
arnold
brewery
the
beer
poured
a
straw
colored
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
the
beer
had
a
slight
lemonygrassy
smell
and
taste
i
have
had
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
numerous
times
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
tried
it
on
tap
and
it
was
definitely
better
on
tap
it
was
also
very
cool
to
be
drinking
the
beer
while
the
founder
of
the
company
was
telling
me
the
history
of
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
hot
weather
beers
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
needing
a
beer
to
quench
your
thirst
overall
a
very
tasty
kolsch
that
is
supremely
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
brentk56
for
this
one
verdict
while
kölsch
is
not
one
of
my
normal
styles
this
is
certainly
a
beer
i
can
enjoy
if
i
was
outside
in
the
heat
at
a
ballgame
this
would
be
an
almost
perfect
choice
d
great
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
trumps
most
beers
i
have
had
of
the
style
great
beer
to
get
any
of
your
friends
off
the
piss
beers
white
head
good
hearty
light
sweet
grassy
grain
smell
with
almost
no
noticable
bitterness
and
almost
creamy
yet
light
light
to
medium
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
but
with
a
slight
chemically
twinge
at
times
a
great
summer
beer
all
around
that
is
somewhat
simple
and
easy
to
drink
and
twistoff
lawnmower
beer
for
shure
id
love
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
you
may
ask
why
is
he
reviewing
a
lawnmower
in
the
middle
of
december
well
my
friends
it
is
77
degrees
here
in
atlanta
today
record
heat
and
this
beer
just
felt
like
the
right
one
for
the
occasion
i
understand
what
st
arnold
was
trying
to
do
with
this
one
and
i
think
they
definitely
done
it
very
refreshing
and
mild
but
nice
characteristics
of
a
quality
craft
brew
very
nice
guys
i
enjoyed
it
thumbs
up
it
pours
a
hazy
dirtyyellow
with
a
light
bmc
beer
looking
head
which
quickly
dissipates
aroma
is
kolschlike
as
i
understand
it
with
some
grainyness
and
a
bit
of
metallic
think
copper
smell
flavor
is
more
cerealy
than
metallic
but
with
enough
copperness
to
make
me
think
of
it
as
kolschlike
in
flavor
not
bad
but
nothing
to
seek
out
after
cutting
the
grass
on
a
hot
day
i
might
opt
for
something
else
d
a
great
beer
for
the
texas
summers
i
should
have
been
paying
more
attention
to
this
beer
i
could
make
a
session
out
of
this
easily
actually
i
cant
believe
i
just
wrote
that
d
im
actually
drinking
this
after
finishing
mowing
my
lawn
it
is
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
and
very
light
enough
to
kick
back
a
few
or
more
if
you
want
a
nice
segue
from
your
standard
pilsner
reach
for
arnies
lawnmower
light
but
flavorful
ive
got
a
new
lawnmower
beer
drinkability
not
really
to
style
this
tastes
more
to
me
like
a
lager
with
a
touch
of
adjunct
great
summertime
beer
good
with
various
foods
especially
white
meats
and
texmex
this
is
a
staple
of
my
warmweather
beer
drinking
and
for
good
reason
highly
recommended
its
not
the
best
beer
that
st
arnies
makes
nor
is
it
highly
complex
or
unusual
its
just
a
good
downhome
sessionbeer
for
the
lazy
hazy
days
of
summer
light
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
pretty
simple
not
crisp
enough
worth
a
try
but
not
outstanding
drinkability
the
name
fits
this
beer
perfectly
an
unbelievable
quaffable
beer
perfect
for
drinking
after
mowing
the
lawn
great
on
a
warm
spring
evening
probably
even
better
on
a
hot
summer
night
i
wish
this
was
local
for
me
cause
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
in
the
spring
and
summer
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
with
a
forced
head
that
goes
down
quick
but
leaves
some
scattered
lacing
aroma
is
of
mild
pale
malts
forceful
graininess
lagerlike
sulfur
notes
and
a
cleanness
rounding
it
out
clean
malt
flavors
meld
with
a
subtle
fruitiness
finishes
dry
with
a
floral
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
with
a
lively
carbonation
solid
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
wanting
a
nice
refreshing
kolsch
or
pilsner
this
is
a
great
beer
to
get
people
started
with
tasting
craft
brews
this
is
what
i
started
my
wife
on
anyways
about
the
beer
saint
arnolds
has
crafted
a
very
accessible
kölsch
with
a
great
light
color
thin
head
but
a
crisp
refreshing
taste
year
round
brew
if
you
are
new
to
brew
try
it
if
you
are
beer
knurd
then
keep
it
for
the
people
you
are
trying
to
convert
d
very
drinkable
keep
cold
d
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
by
the
pool
md
highly
drinkable
the
hops
and
malts
though
alone
are
well
balanced
and
easy
to
put
back
would
make
a
great
session
beer
taste
is
a
little
bitey
up
front
a
hint
of
lemon
is
evident
sweet
low
on
the
bittering
hops
but
nice
and
clean
nothing
overpowering
here
and
the
flavors
blend
pretty
nicely
a
lawn
mower
beer
indeed
this
stuff
goes
down
like
iced
tea
rather
thin
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
again
lemony
did
lemon
zest
go
into
this
i
like
it
and
thanks
to
my
coworker
scot
for
bringing
me
a
bottle
from
texas
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
would
be
a
much
better
warm
weather
beer
than
a
year
round
offering
in
my
opinon
clearish
yellow
with
no
real
head
looks
macroey
nose
is
grains
and
slight
citrus
taste
is
very
mild
corn
wheres
the
lawn
clippings
mouthfeel
is
decent
drinkability
is
highish
due
to
low
abv
overall
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
its
probably
a
good
light
summery
bbq
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
forming
a
1
inch
fluffy
head
leaving
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
bad
on
this
one
very
skunky
aroma
thats
about
all
that
i
can
detect
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
little
better
some
light
hops
and
a
slight
lemon
flavor
light
mouthfeel
if
it
werent
for
the
smell
this
beer
might
be
a
good
one
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
bad
not
great
slightly
above
average
drinkability
given
the
style
overall
impression
very
nice
session
beer
this
is
a
definitely
more
interesting
than
a
lot
of
the
lighter
offerings
some
microbrewers
put
out
definitely
a
great
gateway
the
name
caught
my
eye
i
just
had
to
try
it
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
mouthfeel
is
good
pretty
light
compared
to
their
other
products
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
south
texas
summer
day
say
like
after
fishing
golf
or
cutting
the
grass
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
i
would
recomend
taking
this
to
a
party
were
you
are
trying
to
wheen
your
freinds
off
the
light
beer
fad
mild
smell
and
flavor
making
this
beer
very
inoffensive
read
easily
drinkable
for
anybody
still
refreshing
with
some
flavor
not
bad
overall
an
average
kolsch
and
one
thats
easy
to
drink
refreshing
yes
and
quite
drinkable
but
it
seems
to
lack
the
fruity
yeast
character
of
a
good
kolsch
this
stuff
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
youd
hope
for
when
looking
at
it
not
especially
memorable
but
quite
pleasing
and
definitely
suited
to
quenching
ones
thirst
after
a
couple
hours
of
yardwork
id
have
another
probably
several
in
sequence
come
to
that
and
i
definitely
wouldnt
object
to
keeping
a
bit
around
the
house
for
these
summer
days
pours
a
nicely
clear
pale
yellow
theres
not
much
happening
here
flavor
wise
but
i
guess
thats
the
point
with
a
lawnmower
beer
lightly
carbonated
it
was
surprisingly
refreshing
this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
would
certainly
make
a
nice
conclusion
to
a
day
of
yardwork
carbonation
and
body
are
really
superb
for
this
brew
with
just
the
right
amount
of
thickness
without
overdoing
it
sits
a
little
heavy
in
the
stomach
with
all
the
sweetness
but
i
could
see
fitting
this
into
my
schedule
again
sometime
overall
impression
refreshing
an
easy
session
beer
great
for
the
broiler
summers
of
texas
hits
what
its
aiming
at
im
just
never
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
after
mowing
the
back
40
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
had
a
nice
pale
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
or
lacing
had
some
carbonation
the
aroma
had
a
grassy
grainy
smell
to
it
typical
of
the
style
the
look
and
smell
were
average
but
the
taste
was
really
good
im
a
fan
of
the
style
in
general
and
have
come
to
really
appreciate
it
on
those
hot
texas
summer
days
goes
down
smooth
and
hits
the
spot
on
a
100
degree
day
during
the
summer
this
is
one
of
my
session
beers
especially
when
working
outside
i
really
like
st
arnolds
beers
and
for
me
this
is
their
best
4
hr
t
y
opinion
well
i
was
having
fun
with
this
beer
until
i
drank
it
the
metallic
flavor
really
turned
me
off
i
am
a
big
supporter
of
st
arnolds
beers
but
i
was
really
disappointed
in
this
one
this
is
just
a
waterprocess
problem
so
it
should
be
pretty
easy
to
get
taken
care
of
i
will
see
if
i
can
mention
it
to
brock
and
see
what
happens
cheers2beers
notes
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
has
that
thirst
quenching
quality
but
its
a
little
bland
would
have
liked
some
more
hops
flavor
and
hop
bitterness
would
be
nice
too
also
the
head
retention
needs
some
work
overall
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
carbonation
is
moderately
low
as
for
drinkablility
this
one
is
obviously
made
to
satisfy
those
who
like
to
tip
back
a
few
light
beers
on
a
hot
afternoon
reviewed
on
january
18th
in
houston
saint
arnold
boasts
being
the
oldest
microbrewery
in
texas
and
they
sold
me
on
that
slogan
and
the
fact
that
there
was
a
unique
flavor
in
the
lawn
mower
ale
it
seems
as
a
summer
ale
however
the
flavor
doesnt
come
out
that
easy
it
is
a
very
hard
beer
to
drink
and
is
very
hoppy
i
really
enjoy
hoppy
beers
however
in
beer
you
are
supposed
to
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
if
it
says
its
a
summer
beer
be
a
little
lighter
not
a
good
choice
would
recommend
another
company
and
flavor
drinkability
good
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
tastes
great
on
a
80
november
texas
winter
day
money
out
of
the
macros
pockets
this
is
the
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
i
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
is
way
too
expensive
though
the
smell
is
grainy
and
the
taste
is
somewhat
grassy
its
very
refreshing
and
quite
thirst
quenching
with
a
name
like
lawnmower
this
sure
hits
the
spot
anytime
im
adding
this
to
my
beers
choice
an
excellent
brew
it
is
drinkability
is
easy
mouthfeel
is
light
appearance
actually
had
some
color
to
it
this
beer
tastes
good
period
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
a
decent
beer
at
any
rate
this
beer
pours
a
lightly
hazy
with
some
floaties
orangish
gold
color
it
is
topped
by
a
frothy
large
bubbled
pale
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
grain
and
grassy
notes
with
hints
of
peach
and
lemon
the
taste
has
a
lightly
sweet
grain
character
to
it
and
finishes
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
that
just
manages
to
tickle
the
back
of
my
throat
this
beer
is
really
quite
light
on
the
palate
quite
thirst
quenching
and
simple
with
a
name
like
lawnmower
that
is
probably
the
point
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
it
is
lightly
fruity
lemon
pear
with
a
bit
of
herbal
hop
notes
some
flower
nectar
type
thing
going
on
and
a
light
bitterness
as
well
as
some
sweet
grain
notes
simple
and
refreshing
not
one
of
my
favorite
kolschs
but
it
will
definitely
work
for
me
could
be
a
good
cross
over
beer
its
ok
dog
flows
down
with
a
moderate
ease
and
effort
it
doesnt
offer
much
across
the
board
for
full
kolsch
character
but
it
is
clean
and
smooth
enough
for
semiquick
enjoyment
on
any
given
day
hot
or
not
and
at
4
9
is
gonna
be
better
then
most
marco
attempts
to
cooling
your
jets
after
a
long
mornings
mow
not
that
id
know
leaving
in
a
building
for
15
years
but
i
use
to
have
to
mow
2
5
acres
as
a
youngster
and
nothing
sucked
more
then
3
hours
of
moving
and
this
stuff
wouldve
hit
the
spot
just
fine
as
a
finisher
as
i
always
needed
to
hose
of
the
clipping
stuck
to
my
body
appearance
is
light
straw
colored
head
is
light
and
frothy
aroma
is
clean
but
not
very
strong
the
available
aromas
are
mildly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
wheat
the
taste
is
mild
but
balanced
lightly
sweet
with
some
wheatiness
light
but
very
crisp
on
the
tongue
fancy
lawn
mower
beer
is
a
good
term
for
this
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
light
but
still
has
enough
flavor
to
drink
just
for
the
sake
of
enjoying
beer
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
hops
dominate
the
beer
but
it
is
crisp
i
very
much
enjoy
this
beer
drinkability
a
little
gassy
but
tastier
than
the
average
macro
i
think
id
enjoy
it
more
with
a
barbecue
than
for
after
yard
work
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
medium
gold
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
very
malty
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
there
but
lots
of
standard
pale
malt
the
taste
is
very
malty
a
little
light
but
has
a
crisp
refreshing
hops
finish
a
fairly
balanced
taste
just
need
more
oomph
the
mouthfeel
is
fairty
thick
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
good
a
decent
lager
fits
the
name
well
cannot
really
discern
much
from
the
smell
but
unlike
other
lagers
this
beer
actually
had
a
disrtinct
taste
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
could
finish
off
a
six
pack
after
cutting
the
lawn
still
waiting
to
sample
the
summer
pilsner
very
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
of
st
arnolds
offerings
but
none
the
less
a
very
good
beer
that
will
and
probably
appeals
to
many
a
decent
beer
from
houston
that
aspites
to
be
a
kolsch
i
was
actually
surprised
with
how
good
it
was
this
beer
wasnt
too
disappointing
but
could
have
been
a
little
better
in
each
category
this
is
a
tangy
very
dry
medium
for
delivering
beer
flavor
and
alcohol
to
the
thirsty
consumer
the
clear
pale
gold
beer
sports
a
mediumsized
white
noisy
head
faint
nuttiness
peanuts
even
in
the
nose
the
front
is
nice
and
grainsy
middle
sweetens
to
a
pleasant
fruitiness
really
its
almost
berrylike
finish
is
very
nutty
with
a
nice
grassy
hoppiness
its
a
fresh
nutty
light
beer
the
label
which
says
fancy
lawnmower
beer
sums
this
beer
up
completely
a
light
partially
due
to
the
paltry
hopping
mild
notes
of
grain
husk
emerge
late
concomitantly
with
a
subdued
herbal
hop
flavor
lightly
bodied

packaged
in
a
twelveounce
short
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
very
drinkable
hearsay
is
that
the
house
yeast
strain
was
not
used
in
this
beer
which
yuck
first
bad
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
possibly
just
a
bad
luck
of
the
draw
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
theres
a
faint
roasted
malt
smell
tastes
very
similar
to
the
lawnmower
but
with
some
roasted
malt
flavors
overall
a
good
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
floral
hops
taste
is
a
bit
different
for
the
style
malts
bready
nutty
some
hops
are
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
a
dark
kolch
that
didnt
interest
me
not
much
there
in
terms
of
flavor
love
the
flavor
great
taste
very
good
black
kolch
wish
it
was
stronger

overall
i
had
one
and
enjoyed
it
i
went
to
put
my
score
in
and
saw
that
this
was
not
rated
all
that
well
went
with
an
ipa
next
than
came
back
for
anther
santo
to
try
confirm
if
i
was
off
or
the
rating
was
i
really
enjoyed
the
second
as
much
as
the
first
not
sure
why
this
beer
gets
a
bad
rap
but
i
would
surely
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
on
tap
or
in
a
store
definitely
recommend
trying
and
keeping
your
mind
open
and
not
let
the
low
scores
sour
your
opinion
this
is
what
youd
call
a
lawnmower
beer
a
beach
beer
bbq
beer
wherever
you
need
a
light
goto
this
qualifies
id
prefer
a
can
though
its
a
good
beer
overall
a
decent
malty
medium
body
lager
othis
would
be
a
great
beer
for
those
that
do
not
like
heavy
coffee
taste
or
a
hard
bitter
taste
reminds
me
of
a
negro
modelo
draught
fat
grass
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
caramel
color
there
was
a
wisp
of
an
offwhite
head
on
it
that
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
touch
light
but
good
light
roastiness
and
chocolate
maybe
some
earthiness
and
toffee
the
taste
is
good
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
some
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
graininess
perhaps
a
touch
of
smokiness
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
nice
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
a
black
kolsch
some
may
say
they
were
just
too
lazy
to
lager
this
thing
not
that
it
really
would
have
helped
a
whole
lot
in
my
opinion
watery
see
through
brown
in
color
short
lived
half
inch
of
tan
suds
smells
loosely
like
roasted
barley
but
not
enough
of
it
its
thin
and
transparent
aromatically
faint
cocoa
notes
too
but
they
seem
watered
down
as
well
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
flavor
is
a
lot
like
the
nose
but
the
absence
of
enough
malt
is
more
apparent
supposed
to
be
a
bold
and
roasty
brew
it
lacks
that
depth
it
also
lacks
enough
body
to
really
work
in
this
colder
weather
perhaps
better
in
a
summer
context
when
a
bit
of
a
darker
beer
is
sought
but
a
light
body
is
still
in
season
as
it
stands
today
this
beer
really
missed
the
mark
for
me
and
now
after
a
handful
of
beers
saint
arnold
is
still
yet
to
really
make
much
of
an
impression
on
me
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
not
a
kölsch
lots
toasted
malt
sweet
with
some
spritz
full
bodied
short
aftertaste
overall
its
a
run
of
the
mill
brown
ale
taste
wise
a
very
good
roasted
grain
ale
that
really
emphasizes
the
malts
the
hop
presence
is
pretty
subdued
especially
with
bitterness
yet
the
lightly
charred
character
of
the
malt
sugars
hold
their
own
and
make
the
beer
a
winner
overall
a
rather
disappointing
beer
due
to
the
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
which
is
surprising
coming
from
a
saint
arnold
product
d
really
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
disappointing
a
malt
focused
beer
with
just
a
touch
of
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
character
simple
easy
drinking
for
when
you
want
a
roast
accented
beer
not
bad
and
even
enjoyable
but
not
all
that
interesting
for
me
c
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
hue
thick
bubbly
head
and
some
nice
lacing
nose
is
roasty
with
sweet
and
nutty
components
lightly
roasted
malt
nuts
and
sweetness
all
components
lightly
applied
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
medium
mouthfeel
a
fantastic
break
from
the
hopbomb
craze
i
hope
sa
keeps
making
this
yearround
a
perfect
option
when
i
want
a
lighter
malt
maltbomb
pours
very
dark
amber
color
cloudy
and
almost
brown
really
a
brown
finger
width
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
there
is
a
small
amount
of
lacing
that
quickly
recedes
after
swirling
it
does
not
persist
on
the
glass
there
is
a
sour
bready
and
almost
fruity
aroma
almost
roasted
malty
taste
up
front
with
a
very
slight
bitterness
followed
by
a
very
mild
sweetness
at
the
end
as
a
black
kolsch

something

in
a
way
but
overall
its
a

kind
of
beer

its

it
is

at
something

this
is
by

the
worst
one
by
them
i
have
had

not

a
little
bland
and
boring
really
rich

a
realize
that

trying
to
make
a
session
beer
here
eric
go
for
gaffel
over
this
its
an
ok
kolsch
nothing
bad
about
it
but
its
not
something
to
seek
out
is
this
a
sign
of
we
we
can
start
to
expect
from
sam

pointless
and
mediocre
if
im
generous
seasonal
brews
shoveled

an
opaque

clean
golden
yellow
with

as
white
and
whispy
as
can
be
into
stange
glass
which
i
purchased
earlier
today
for
the
occasion
smells
about
like
a

macro
lager
but
less
strong
that
would
be

more
so
than
hops
and
possibly
a
trace

some
kölsches
have
a
smidgeon

not
sure
about
the
sam

very
wellbalanced
i
prefer
beers
that
more
heavily
favor
either
the

the

even
the

to
a

im
not
terribly
enthusiastic
about

has
a
nice
crisp
clean
taste
perhaps
slightly
too
carbonated
overall
very
agreeable
beer
and
easy
drinking
for
anyone
this
is
a
very
pleasing
style
and
sam
adams
tackled
the
kolsch
well
a
beer
for
all
seasons
to
be
had
here
currently
splitting
a
12oz
bottle
into
two
pint
glasses
with
a
friend
its
not
bad
at
all
aroma
is
fragrant
and
fruity
taste
is
of
hops
and
bready
malt
with
a
slightly
spicy
peppery
finish
not
a
bad
addition
to
the
sa
line
but
im
also
not
sure
if
its
all
that
different
from
a
few
of
their
other
brews
it
just
didnt
hold
my
attention
my
wife
and
i
once
spend
a
week
trying
to
sample
every
kolsch
in
cologne
visiting
more
than
a
dozen
neighborhood
brew
houses
best
beer
adventure
of
my
life
we
were
there
for
an
academic
conference
hope
the
dean
isnt
reading
this
anyhow
going
in
having
read
the
description
of
this
distinctive
local
brew
i
was
less
than
enthused
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
was
a
convert
i
have
been
buying
domestic
kolsches
ever
since
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
with
record
breaking
snowfall
this
year
and
mornings
that
routinely
start
below
0
i
welcome
any
beer
that
reminds
me
of
warmer
weather
that
said
cold
snap
may
not
be
the
most
exciting
kölsch
on
the
market
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
tasty
and
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
heavier
winter
offerings
good
but
tastes
like
a
normal
beer
the
beer
is
what
it
intended
to
be
an
easy
drinking
crisp
brew
its
not
terribly
exciting
and
there
is
a
bit
too
much
euro
lager
to
this
one
but
its
a
fine
beer
a
really
nice
and
smooth
beer
nice
light
beer
goes
well
with
beef
delicious
crisp
taste
nose
malt
light
straw
citrus
cereal
faint
honey
floral
taste
sweet
malt
grains
fruitiness
slight
bitter
finish
looking
at
it
as
a
kölsch
though
i
guess
it
does
have
a
pleasant
fruitiness
i
dont
find
the
malt
character
to
fit
my
impression
of
the
style
but
its
samuel
adams
take
on
the
style
so
they
can
do
whatever
they
want
ill
just
pass
it
by
just
ok
but
i
was
glad
to
have
tried
it
pours
in
to
a
fluted
glass
with
a
slightly
hazy
chilled
golden
color
less
clarity
than
i
anticipated
the
shortlived
head
of
white
foam
recedes
to
a
small
ribbon
of
lithe
lacing
the
aroma
is
relatively
simple
consisting
of
a
honeylike
fragrance
floral
hop
notes
and
little
lemon
citrus
altogether
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
summer
time
and
makes
me
yearn
for
warmer
weather
the
first
sip
brings
a
bright
vibrant
flavor
of
crackerlike
malts
with
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
hop
bitterness
a
little
milled
grain
lingers
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
little
more
heartiness
than
i
expected
still
its
exceptionally
crisp
and
clean
spritzy
carbonation
adds
a
little
zest
this
is
a
fantastic
palate
cleanser
that
stands
in
nicely
any
time
youre
tired
of
the
megabrews
that
we
beer
advocates
tend
to
gravitate
to
it
may
have
just
earned
a
place
in
my
fridge
when
im
looking
for
a
good
kolsch
smells
sweet
tastes
sweeter
this
overwhelms
the
usually
savory
flavours
you
get
from
kölsch
lagers
if
there
are
any
in
this
beer
not
very
true
to
style
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
ive
had
overall
not
bad
for
my
first
kolsch
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
a
great
beer
from
sam
adams
how
they
keep
doing
it
i
just
dont
know
this
offering
pours
out
a
great
thick
head
with
very
good
lacing
although
i
really
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
cloudy
beers
the
odor
was
interesting
if
not
enjoyable
mix
of
fruit
and
yeast
this
was
by
far
the
most
outstanding
mouthfeel
i
have
had
to
date
incredible
smoothness
very
crisp
and
very
light
the
mix
of
halfale
halflager
works
extremely
well
much
more
so
than
what
i
expected
in
short
the
brew
delivers
on
its
promise
as
i
downed
a
couple
on
a
cold
winters
night
looking
forward
to
warmer
summer
days
solid
gold
with
some
haze
and
a
large
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
in
fuzzy
clumps
smells
of
dough
grass
soft
fruit
caramel
and
clean
sa
lager
yeast
honey
fruit
cereal
and
spice
in
the
mouth
some
bready
caramel
malt
again
which
seems
a
little
out
of
place
and
lessens
the
softness
that
the
style
requires
still
easy
drinking
and
nicely
crisp
plenty
of
that
sam
adams
house
character
too
which
can
sometimes
distract
an
otherwise
decent
beer
overall
this
is
a
nice
escape
from
the
winter
blues
i
dont
know
how
id
rate
it
against
a
typical
summer
kolsch
but
perhaps
they
pull
their
summer
kolsch
and
market
this
winter
version
4
months
out
of
the
year
perhaps
there
is
a
difference
and
im
not
savvy
enough
to
discern
it
it
is
a
nice
beer
and
id
drink
it
again
on
the
palate
the
citrus
jumps
up
to
the
front
giving
notes
of
lemon
and
orange
the
coriander
style
note
is
a
little
more
prevalent
and
an
almost
hoppy
kind
of
herb
touches
in
the
yeasty
notes
grow
especially
on
the
finish
giving
it
a
refreshing
clean
kind
of
lemonyyeast
finish
overall
the
light
body
and
refreshing
flavors
keep
it
a
simple
and
pleasant
brew
to
quaff
even
if
not
complex
poured
from
bottle
into
pilsner
glass
very
pale
golden
orange
with
soapy
white
head
two
fizzy
fingers
worth
the
head
dissipates
quickly
tiny
bit
of
lacing
with
a
little
cap
steady
carbonation
through
out
the
session
it
takes
a
little
while
to
peg
the
aroma
ive
settled
on
lemon
yeast
a
small
bit
of
spice
taste
is
subtle
tart
fruit
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
everything
about
this
brew
is
slight
inoffensive
sessionable
but
not
something
id
buy
on
its
own
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
session
beer
good
flavors
of
malt
and
citrus
and
sweetness
with
a
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
id
certainly
get
it
again
did
not
like
taste
at
all
bland
not
a
good
sam
adams
did
not
like
not
enjoyable
kolsch
for
me
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
other
than
a
good
fruity
aroma
this
really
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
kolsch
but
of
a
very
unique
beer
at
least
aroma
is
rather
unpleasant
very
mild
flavor
initially
slightly
sweet
quickly
gives
way
to
wheaty
lager
notes
without
much
bitterness
or
flavor
on
the
finish
i
enjoy
a
more
hoppy
flavorful
beer
citrusy

a
nice
break
from

is
an
unfiltered

you
can
not

is

you
also
pick
up
on

in

brew
the

you
pick

a

of

the

clean
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
it
has
a
nice

to
it

im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
of
5
pours
with
a
medium
white
head
has
a
hazy
golden
color
aroma
is
not
very
pleasant
sort
of
citrusy
like
an
ale
but
masked
with
an
unknown
bitter
smell
initial
taste
is
fruity
like
an
ale
but
has
a
bad
aftertaste
of
malts
similar
to
what
you
would
find
in
a
coors
lite
personally
a
sad
failure
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
one
it
wasnt
bad
but
there
are
better
kölsch
out
there
this
pours
a
semicloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
bland
with
hints
of
citrus
and
wheats
in
case
you
dont
look
at
the
style
before
taking
a
sip
youll
realize
real
fast
that
this
is
no
ordinary
tasting
brew
there
is
a
lot
of
unfiltered
grain
with
hints
of
rye
flavors

this
kolsch
unique

say
the

with
light

notes
light
grassy
hops
and
slight
lemon
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
the
aroma
got
me
excited
but
the
main
initial
flavors
here
are
closer
to
a
typical
american
lager
although
there
is
biscuit
and
german
style
hops
in
the
finish
a
pleasant
enough
light
lager
but
not
quite
a
traditional
kolsch
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
it
has
gold
color
body
witj
a
small
head
to
it
the
smell
has
a
light
fruit
bread
aroma
to
it
the
taste
has
a
light
malt
flavor
and
some
grassyhay
notes
to
it
also
i
also
get
a
little
hop
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
a
good
beer
overall
an
easy
drinker
best
suited
for
the
warmer
weather
appearance
has
a
golden
yellow
color
supporting
a
thin
head
leaving
nil
lace
smell
is
grainy
malty
with
a
slight
zip
of
hops
taste
is
again
grainy
with
light
malt
and
light
hop
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
not
an
overly
impressive
beer
has
a
off
bitter
bite
in
the
end
the
beer
comes
across
to
me
as
an
american
lager
something
i
might
have
tried
in
1985
and
decided
i
didnt
really
like
beer
ok
its
better
than
some
of
those
but
not
by
huge
amount
overall
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
light
ale
but
not
my
idea
of
a
kölsch
less
refreshing
than
a
chewy
and
malty
brew
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
special
brews
in
lynwood
washington
no
need
for
an
escape
route
from
this
graduation
party
but
ill
take
the
namesake
beer
it
pours
a
clear
brassstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
white
bread
mild
white
wine
grapes
hard
water
and
a
touch
of
dark
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
bread
and
hard
water
taking
firm
command
of
the
situation
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slickish
feel
overall
a
decent
enough
kolsch
but
its
not
something
i
plan
on
having
again
in
the
near
future
o
decent
enough
but
i
find
myself
wanting
more
flavor
maybe
it
is
just
too
plain
for
me
o
very
enjoyable
a
good
easy
drinking
summer
beer
that
packs
a
little
more
flavor
than
your
standard
fare
overall
its
a
decent
kölsch
but
it
doesnt
come
close
to
long
trails
ramble
kölsch
why
cant
i
find
a
case
overall
a
nice
little
beer
just
wondering
if
a
kolsch
should
be
slightly
crisper
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
may
2014
one
of
my
friends
gave
this
to
me
a
couple
weeks
ago
so
i
didnt
get
a
chance
to
drink
it
until
now
served
in
a
stange
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
an
inch
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
breadygrainy
malt
fruit
mostly
apple
and
some
light
herbalness
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
grassiness
pear
and
lemon
peel
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
refreshing
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
next
time
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
definitely
worth
trying
pours
light
bright
see
through
low

fruity
malty

mild
bitter
light
soft
taste
kolsch
but
with
an
edge
only
flavor
is
on
the
gritty
side
smooth
taste
consistent
but
unremarkable
other
seasonals
have
fared
better
in
the
end
this
beer
is
lacking
in
flavor
and
reminds
me
a
bit
of
macro
lager
over
kolsch
overall
a
well
deserved
4
5
for
a
fusion
of
two
bonafide
styles
ale
and
lager
this
brew
did
a
knockout
job
of
integrating
the
very
best
of
both
worlds
i
will
certainly
buy
this
brew
again
take
an
escape
you
deserve
it
overall
ok
im
not
much
on
this
style
and
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
buy
it
if
not
part
of
a
sampler
mouthfeel
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
and
clean
just
like
a
kolsch
should
be
overall
meh
not
one
of
sam
adams
best
beers
just
a
little
kolsch
like
notes
hops
are
not
quite
where
they
should
be
for
a
kolsch
malts
are
ok
at
least
and
it
has
a
nice
soft
slight
crisp
feel
taste
starts
with
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
with
a
hint
of
rind
bitterness
clean
dry
finish
with
a
fairly
soft
carbonation
so
its
not
as
crisp
as
it
could
be
but
its
also
creamier
than
it
should
be
too
pours
a
murky

and
hay
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount

on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level

this
is
a
pretty
good

that
is

that
would
not

impress
anyone
a
good
fourth

to
serve
to
people
who
do
not

like

i
will
probably
not
buy
this
one

oa

is
welcoming
i
miss
goose
islandsummertime
which
was
memorable
if
anything
escape
route
will
encourage
one
to
order
foreign
online
or
visit
the
birthplace
of
kolsch
for
the
purest
style
taste
o
not
really
the
best
kolsch
and
exhibits
lager
qualities
but
is
just
overall
single
noted
and
kinda
bland
do
this
is
a
bold
americanbrewed
kolsch
that
is
fullbodied
and
heavy
on
yeast
qualities
pilsner
malts
provide
needed
contrast
keeping
other
qualities
from
becoming
too
heavy
minimalist
hops
stay
off
the
radar
although
they
are
not
really
missed
here
while
refreshing
on
its
own
this
beer
is
far
from
being
an
afterthought
and
holds
up
to
foods
well
o
overall
while
more
of
hybrid
then
a
traditional
kolsch
it
adds
some
tart
yeasty
nature
of
a
wit
with
the
crispness
of
a
lager
and
ale
drinkability
is
easy
cleany
brewed
with
a
light
dry
finish
its
a
twist
on
a
kolsch
with
some
added
spice
and
flair
overall
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
new
to
kolsch
brews
so
this
is
a
first
kolsch
for
me
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
i
would
buy
this
again
however
i
bet
there
are
better
kolsch
brews
out
there
somewhere
to
good
health
and
good
allseason
beer
smells
and
tastes
like
sam
adams
cold
snap
very
fruity
albeit
good
overall
beer
i
was
pleased
by
the
5
00
alcoholic
content
as
sam
adams
usually
does
ones
with
lower
abv
its
a
good
spring
beer
and
really
refreshing
perfect
for
after
a
baseball
game
or
a
round
of
golf
i
would
order
it
again
given
the
chance
a
kolsch
golden
ale
hybrid
with
the
initial
crispness
and
some
of
the
kolsch
graininess
with
the
smooth
body
and
decadent
foam
of
a
fine
golden
ale
i
wouldnt
rate
escape
route
very
highly
as
a
kolsch
but
as
a
kolschtypething
i
like
it
a
lot
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
the
smell
is
basically
mirrored
by
the
taste
with
the
malt
and
citrus
themes
but
the
taste
also
adds
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
it
i
might
get
this
again
i
rank
this
as
above
average
it
does
not
produce
much
to
make
you
want
more
but
also
never
offends
overall
a
nice
refreshing
drink
more
interesting
than
a
lager
without
the
bitterness
of
an
ale
the
yeasty
citrus
smell
and
flavor
are
reminiscent
of
an
unfiltered
wheat
nice
and
light
and
perfect
for
springtime
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
worth
pounding
down
for
a
while
if
your
options
are
a
bit
limited
o
not
exactly
what
i
expected
for
a
kolsch
but
nevertheless
refreshing
after
working
outside
on
a
nice
spring
day
o
refreshing
but
not
much
for
taste
this
one
might
have
you
looking
for
an
escape
route
to
the
next
beer
really
just
an
average
been
once
again
from
sam
adams
it
seems
like
they
are
brewing
the
same
batch
of
lager
and
adding
flavors
after
the
brew
but
it
is
sessiony
and
it
was
the
super
bowl
so
they
went
down
easy
with
some
food
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
o
slightly
above
average
would
rater
have
a
solid
white
overall
another
good
brew
from
samuel
adams
the
beer
pours
a
clear
darker
orangeyellow
with
a
white
head
of
medium
sized
rocky
bubbles
that
sit
about
a
fingers
width
above
the
glass
it
leaves
a
string
of
fluffy
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
smells
of
clean
cracker
malt
and
subtle
herbal
hops
with
a
minty
hint
there
is
even
a
buttery
bread
quality
to
everything
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
nicely
crisp
with
sweetness
and
herbal
grassy
bitterness
very
soft
acidity
gives
a
bright
tingles
at
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
in
flavor
the
beer
opens
with
soft
cracker
malt
opening
into
almost
cidery
sweetness
and
grassy
bitterness
that
mingles
to
nearly
cool
mint
herbal
flavors
the
finish
is
cidery
and
dry
with
a
touch
of
herbal
mint
the
beer
ends
with
a
balance
of
sweet
bitterness
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
with
a
nearly
crisp
mouthfeel
a
prickly
carbonation
the
mouth
is
left
dry
yet
sticky
with
lots
of
saliva
running
in
the
pouches
of
the
cheeks
overall
this
is
a
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
kölsch
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
is
refreshing
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
another
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
o
pretty
good
for
the
style
im
spoiled
as
arguably
the
best
kolsch
brewed
is
right
in
my
back
yard
at
coast
and
i
enjoy
it
on
a
regular
basis
this
one
pales
in
comparison
but
is
still
definitely
worthy
of
a
drink
the
escape
route
is
a
decent
beer
i
would
think
better
for
summer
than
late
winterspring
nevertheless
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
has
a
lemon
citrus
zing
the
taste
is
balanced
nicely
hints
of
citrus
with
touches
of
spice
very
refreshing
something
to
kick
the
taste
buds
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
white
fivefinger
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
hazy
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
light
lemon

is
a
lemony
grain

in

with
small
streaming
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
close
to
a
1finger

that
lasts
a

and
some

with

the

of

with

with

the

about
the

with

very
easy
to

with
no

overall
a
tasty
brew
a
nice
refreshing
kolsch
rjt
pretty
spot
on
to
style
which
it
doesnt
surprise
me
that
this
would
be
a
style
sam
adams
can
nail
id
drink
this
again
if
i
found
it
dirt
cheap
for
a
sizer
preferably
in
the
summer
o
escape
route
is
a
good
beer
for
its
category
its
crisp
brightness
and
hoppy
bitterness
does
what
it
advertises
gets
you
through
the
remainder
of
winter
it
is
also
very
drinkable
it
a
more
bitter
complex
drinkin
beer
it
has
a
very
light
build
and
its
fruit
notes
might
make
it
a
bit
more
suited
for
a
summer
brew
overall
though
it
was
a
good
solid
beer
its
not
the
best
kolsch
ive
had
but
its
still
tasty
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
overall
pretty
average
kolsch
there
are
better
alternatives
out
there
folks
bitterness
lasts
longer
than
most
other
kolschs
and
there
is
too
much
sweetness
overall
ive
had
better
but
this
is
a
nice
kolsch
it
has
that
generic
malt
flavor
that
seems
to
plague
lots
of
sas
beers
but
its
still
tasty
the
fruit
notes
were
faint
but
the
finish
was
nice
and
smooth
aside
from
the
unnecessary
haze
this
is
a
very
crushable
brew
give
me
a
liter
mug
of
this
now
overall
overall
this
is
not
a
favorite
beer
the
appearance
i
wrote
of
was
disturbing
the
flavor
was
ok
and
actually
for
a
sam
adams
it
was
disappointing
this
is
my
taste
and
opinion
and
anyone
who
reads
this
should
draw
their
own
conclusion
an
excellent
drinker
for
spring
like
the
very
light
toasted
malt
character
but
its
a
little
beefy
for
the
style
not
for
the
season
though
and
this
is
a
seasonal
hops
are
appropriate
and
i
like
the
two
varieties
used
aramis
and
strisselspalt
i
liked
the
alpine
spring
a
couple
years
ago
and
like
this
just
as
much
overall
a
nice
offering
from
the
boston
brewery
the
body
is
almost
medium
but
has
a
thickness
to
it
that
doesnt
work
as
well
for
this
style
as
a
nice
bright
lightbodied
crispness
would
crispness
has
trouble
taking
hold
though
it
remains
lightly
all
the
way
through
as
the
sweetness
ends
up
beinga
bit
too
cloying
on
the
palate
it
was
light
in
the
belly
and
highly
drinkable
gotta
say
i
was
mildly
surprised
on
this
one
a
nicely
done
kölschstyled
beer
light
and
airy
with
a
respectable
mild
grain
and
fruity
note
to
the
scent
and
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
impressive
and
rounds
out
the
overall
character
nicely
easy
drinking
and
satisfying
it
is
an
okay
beer
but
is
lacking
something
i
hate
to
say
it
but
it
almost
feels
gimmicky
to
me
a
kolsch
beer
released
in
january
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
excellent
retention
and
a
very
nice
lace
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
buttery
malts
and
lemon
nice
but
weak
body
was
crisp
and
rich
taste
has
a
nice
lemon
zing
through
out
good
balance
but
for
me
didnt
taste
like
a
traditional
kolsch
never
the
less
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
would
recommend
a
try
overall
a
decent
beer
poured
this
into
my
trusty
pint
glass
golden
color
with
minimal
head
tastes
all
around
delicious
and
very
crisp
again
for
me
a
long
winters
day
this
one
hits
the
spot
in
hoping
that
spring
is
around
the
corner
sam
adams
just
keeps
making
beer
i
like
o
hey
wait
a
minute
you
cant
fool
me
sam
adams
this
tastes
almost
exactly
like
the
old
sam
adams
spring
ale
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
it
was
the
same
recipe
with
a
different
label
decent
then
decent
now
and
much
better
than
some
of
their
spring
offerings
in
recent
years
the
verdict
average
a
weak
watered
down
kolsch
thats
sorely
lacking
in
flavor
im
starting
to
think
that
perhaps
i
should
stick
with
boston
brewings
darker
beers
im
invariably
disappointed
in
their
lighter
offerings
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
foamy
head
and
fair
lacing
nose
bready
and
yeasty
pungent
and
yeasty
flavor
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
overall
a
nice
sessionable
and
clean
kolsch
feels
like
a
good
summer
brew
could
easily
put
away
several
of
these
this
isnt
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
or
the
most
memorable
but
it
does
seem
good
enough
to
recommend
a
sampling
i
will
likely
forget
i
ever
tried
it
in
a
short
time
but
it
is
a
decent
brewing
effort
from
boston
beer
that
may
not
be
a
classic
but
is
certainly
acceptable
to
the
masses
o
a
great
representation
of
a
style
that
is
not
sexy
and
often
looked
over
this
should
be
a
summer
seasonal
not
appropriate
for
a
cold
january
night
anyways
great
job
on
this
beer
everything
you
can
hope
for
in
a
kolsch
the
taste
is
good
with
some
hop
flavor
up
front
more
on
the
herbal
side
with
a
mellow
spiciness
combined
with
mild
toasted
malt
which
has
a
gentle
crackerlike
taste
with
low
sweetness
the
yeast
supports
the
hops
with
a
clean
flavor
in
general
and
adds
a
nice
dry
quality
as
it
finishes
the
flavor
was
interesting
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
the
full
glass
and
want
more
i
like
the
treatment
and
while
i
dont
think
it
is
the
best
example
of
the
style
it
is
pretty
tasty
o
crisp
and
clean
but
seems
very
bland
and
lacking
flavor
im
a
novice
of
this
style
but
i
can
tell
it
might
not
be
for
me
given
that
i
am
trying
to
base
my
review
on
the
style
critics
rather
than
my
personal
taste
preference
i
could
drink
this
again
but
not
one
i
will
seek
out
all
in
all
a
good
brew
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
pretty
standard
and
fairly
true
to
style
example
of
the
style
it
had
most
of
those
kolsch
qualitys
that
i
look
for
and
there
didnt
seem
to
be
any
off
flavors
or
aromas
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
but
its
not
really
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
in
the
winter
time
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
aroma
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
and
they
seemed
to
fairly
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
thought
it
was
a
little
thicker
then
it
should
be
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
when
it
gets
warmer
but
chances
are
since
its
a
limited
release
it
wont
be
around
but
the
label
says
its
good
til
june
so
if
i
see
some
around
when
its
warmer
i
might
pick
up
a
six
pack
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
kolschs
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
solid
kolsch
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
drinkable
as
it
should
be
good
job
samuel
adams
this
was
another
solid
session
beer
keep
up
the
solid
work
overall
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer

a

some

nice
but
nothing
outstanding
the

is
balanced
with

foretaste
and
a
little
more
assertively
prominent
hop
bitterness
than
i
expected
for
the

a

overall
i
got
this
beer
in
a
variety
pack
the
beer
is
just
ok
nothing
special
nothing
terrible
i
most
likely
would
not
purchase
this
beer
again
however
i
would
not
turn

down

offered

me

and
light

counter
medium

with
a
spirited
level
of

and
a

decent
brew
but
not
really
anything
to
write
home
about
very
drinkable
beer
but
theres
just
not
much
character
not
offensive
but
eh
the
is
in
the
sam
adams
spring
pack
but
it
should
be
in
the
summer
pack
because
it
feels
more
like
a
summer
beer
lots
of
grain
in
the
taste
with
a
lemongrass
character
to
lighten
it
up
a
tad
overall
along
the
lines
of
their
eastwest
kolsch
minus
the
east
a
surprising
amount
of
relatively
light
offerings
in
this
years
winter
pack
overall
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
week
entry
by
sa
seems
like
they
needed
a
reason
to
dispose
of
a
spoiled
batch
and
it
ended
up
as
the
final
beer
in
the
seasonal
mixer
o
not
a
good
beer
definitely
surprised
me
getting
this
type
of
beer
from
sam
adams
very
flat
and
very
watery
so
far
the
worst
of
the
spring
variety
pack
o
many
of
sam
adams
best
beers
are
lagers
see
boston
lager
noble
pils
double
agent
winter
lager
while
a
lot
of
their
ales
are
lacking
see
boston
ale
summer
ale
to
me
its
quality
is
closer
to
the
latter
however
it
would
still
make
a
really
good
summer
refresher
so
why
was
it
released
in
january
weird
not
bad
tho
wouldnt
buy
again
floral
mmmm
slight
sweet
note
taste
soda
cracker
pilsner
malt
floral
notes
faint
citrus
very
refreshing
and
lightbodied
would
make
a
decent
session
brew
subtle
and
pleasant
certainly
worth
a
try
a
very
light
beer
but
nothing
bad
comes
to
mind
and
it
balances
out
nicely
no
adjunct
flavors
and
it
isnt
devoid
of
all
flavors
poured
a
beautiful
light
gold
with
a
thick
finger
and
12
width
of
white
head
the
aroma
was
a
slight
floral
aroma
and
a
little
bit
of
maltbread
hard
for
me
to
detect
anything
else
really
flavor
had
a
slight
malt
sweetness
upfront
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
with
some
herbalfloral
presence
but
neither
really
stands
out
clean
dry
finish

cheers
not
really
a
good
beer
not
bad
but
really
unexceptional
and
hardly
a
decent
example
of
a
kolsch
o
very
enjoyable
brew
im
not
really
a
fan
of
their
summer
ale
but
this
def
takes
over
for
a
great
summertime
cookout
brew
of
choice
great
job
o
its
a
good
summer
beer
i
guess
pretty
uninteresting
and
lacking
flavor
probably
accurate
representation
of
style
in
the
summer
mix
i
like
belgian
noble
and
summer
better
clear
golden
in
color
with
some
amber
and
orange
hues
when
held
up
to
the
light
tiny
fizzy
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
like
buttered
crackers
and
straw
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
smells
better
than
i
just
described
but
thats
what
i
thought
of
when
i
whiffed
heavy
malty
backbone
with
lots
of
sweet
honey
banana
flavors
and
a
spicy
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
another
good
summer
beer
from
sam
adams
o
a
bit
heavy
for
a
kolsch
in
my
opinion
i
like
this
style
but
i
dont
particularly
think
this
one
is
the
best
ive
found
definitely
drinkable
but
there
are
better
another
of
the
mix
six
beers
poured
from
its
bottle
into
a
nice
clean
stange
glass
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
goes
away
rather
quicklyand
a
clear
golden
color
a
light
and
crisp
beer
sort
of
wishing
that
summer
wasnt
soon
over
i
hope
it
is
avaible
next
year
as
a
six
pack
drinkability
outstanding
take
on
the
style
i
vote
to
make
this
a
seasonal
in
its
own
sixer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
eastwest
is
a
crisp
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
frothy
head
that
crackles
like
rice
krispies
lots
of
fine
carbonation
rises
from
the
depths
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
all
malt
grainy
and
fruity
apricots
and
pears
the
taste
reflects
the
same
with
a
bit
of
peach
showing
through
on
the
finish
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
minimal
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
some
onot
compelling
but
easily
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
a
summertime
session
overall
like
i
said
this
tastes
like
a
light
beer
to
me
mild
in
flavor
and
aroma
i
have
another
one
in
my
twelvepack
so
my
taste
may
change
a
bit
for
now
though
id
just
give
it
an
average
rating
good
beer
and
everything
but
nothing
about
it
makes
me
say
wow
overall
not
bad
at
all
typically
i
like
a
brew
with
a
little
more
body
and
flavor
but
this
was
very
pleasant
overall
this
is
not
only
a
surprisingly
good
kolsch
but
a
surprisingly
good
beer
from
a
popular
but
recently
disappointing
brewery
clear
gold
color
that
you
can
see
right
through
fizzy
white
head
that
does
not
disappate
too
quickly
nice
clean
appearance
like
a
kolsch
should
have
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
biscuity
aroma
with
a
touch
of
spice
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
dry
finish
and
a
bit
cloying
a
decent
offering
from
sam
adams
but
strays
too
much
from
the
style
for
me
overall
impression
enjoyable
but
seems
a
bit
heavyhanded
for
a
kolsch
was
surprised
at
the
amount
of
noble
hop
character
that
was
evident
in
the
flavor
not
bad
but
not
sure
its
100
accurate
happily
will
enjoy
in
a
pinch
o
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
having
a
little
depth
in
the
flavor
without
being
overpowering
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
to
not
be
too
heavy
in
the
yeast
flavor
like
many
of
their
other
beers
would
certainly
have
a
couple
on
a
hot
friday
night
to
cool
off
i
had
it
from
a
variety
case
and
poured
it
into
a
cup
i
was
surprised
by
its
flavor
at
first
i
never
had
a
kolsch
so
i
had
no
base
to
judge
it
i
find
it
to
be
a
great
beer
in
the
summer
time
because
of
its
great
taste
and
light
feel
i
only
had
one
so
its
hard
to
be
too
specific
with
its
characteristics
but
i
highly
suggest
it
for
those
who
like
a
good
light
summer
beer
with
some
flavor
o
it
has
that
familiar
sam
adams
taste
but
this
is
a
bit
better
than
some
other
offerings
solid
flavor
to
this
one
poured
into
sa
sensory
glass
appearance
is
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
generous
2
finger
white
head
nice
head
retention
and
thick
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
features
fragrant
lemony
esters
with
notes
of
sourdough
bread
pretty
much
right
on
for
the
style
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
with
light
fruity
notes
as
well
as
bready
malt
notes
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
is
packed
into
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
summer
sampler
pack
one
of
the
better
kolschs
i
have
had
definite
session
beer
and
perfect
for
the
summer
its
a
great
american
representation
of
this
style
as
there
are
not
a
lot
of
kölsch
brews
in
the
us
grab
a
giant
glass
boot
and
pound
a
few
of
these
overy
well
balanced
clean
kolsch
pretty
impressed
with
this
coming
from
sam
adams
very
drinkable
would
buy
it
again
depending
on
price
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
beer
worth
pounding
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
alternatives
within
the
style
o
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
it
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
kölsch
beers
i
had
when
i
was
in
köln
a
curious
experiment
in
the
summer
pack
thats
made
the
cut
for
the
summer
12er
again
pours
a
bronzed
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
clear
as
day
with
lots
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
smells
a
bit
floral
jasmine
or
something
also
some
yeasty
spice
and
fresh
bread
notes
much
more
aromatics
that
i
am
used
to
in
a
kolsch
flavor
is
equally
obscure
some
flowery
essences
on
the
front
end
with
a
lot
of
interesting
spice
in
the
middle
maybe
some
cardomom
and
orange
rind
mouthfeel
is
the
letdown
for
me
this
has
too
much
body
for
the
style
which
was
orignially
brewed
to
be
an
easy
drinker
correct
me
if
im
wrong
here
not
to
say
its
heavy
just
that
it
isnt
light
carbonation
is
fine
but
goes
almost
dead
as
it
warms
overall
not
my
favorite
from
the
summer
pack
but
its
a
nice
attempt
at
something
different
do
very
very
drinkable
and
overall
this
is
an
average
kolsch
a
style
that
i
do
not
find
particularly
to
my
liking

this
is
a
pretty
great
kölschstyle
beer
i
dont
usually
drink
em
but
this
mightve
changed
my
mind
if
it
came
in
6packs
instead
of
buried
in
the
summer
seasonals
pours
a
moderately
dark

a

the
added

to
this
beer
is
notable
in
the
flavor
definitive
herbal
notes
but
they
are
delicate
and
add
a
nice
adjustment
to
the
profile
biscuity
malt
and
a
fresh
finish
of
lemon
mild
bitterness
make
this
one
an
easy
beer
to
down
on
a
warm
afternoon
nice
work
bbc
o
this
is
a
very
good
summer
session
beer
and
actually
a
great
example
of
a
kolsch
its
wellbalanced
between
the
malts
and
hops
and
has
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
very
tasty
and
drinkable
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
what
a
damn
fine
beer
from
sa
and
definitely
up
there
with
double
pumpkin
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
beer
that
i
was
a
little
impressed
with
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
good
and
proper
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
the
things
that
i
look
for
in
this
style
with
nothing
that
seemed
off
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
clean
and
with
just
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
three
or
four
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
be
very
nice
drinkable
as
hell
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
good
all
around
simple
tasty
and
clean
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
that
its
only
available
in
this
mixed
pack
if
any
of
the
beers
in
this
mix
pack
are
six
pack
worthy
it
is
for
sure
this
one
i
would
buy
this
beer
on
its
own
but
for
now
i
have
to
get
the
summer
variety
pack
to
get
it
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
summertime
beer
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
i
came
into
this
expecting
and
average
kolsch
and
what
i
got
was
an
above
average
kolsch
that
is
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
i
have
tried
of
that
style
but
i
think
i
like
shorts
kolsch
45
a
little
more
but
since
this
will
be
available
all
summer
chances
are
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
good
job
guys
you
made
one
simple
clean
and
very
drinkable
kolsch
i
like
it
o
i
started
out
thinking
this
was
a
little
weak
but
as
it
warmed
i
found
myself
finding
some
hidden
depths
and
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
this
was
a
decent
enough
little
beer
eric
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
could
easily
be
sessionable
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
of
this
beer
but
it
is
not
a
classic
example
of
the
style
maybe
i
was
spoiled
drinking
these
while
over
in
germany
pours
a
golden
straw
color
full
white
bubbly
head
little
retention
scent
leads
with
some
notes
of
must
grain
and
corn
light
citrus
hops
grassy
faint
sweetness
disjointed
scent
leads
to
disjointed
taste
body
fuller
and
slicker
than
most
others
in
the
style
confused
as
to
the
goal
of
this
rather
than
another
lighter
beer
lacks
much
in
comparison
to
the
true
style
this
is
a
well
balanced
mild
kolsch
it
doesnt
make
any
mistakes
the
aroma
taste
aftertaste
are
all
appropriate
but
it
doesnt
excite
i
would
not
turn
one
of
these
down
but
i
also
would
not
seek
one
out
or
consider
it
a
prime
example
of
the
style
o
pretty
much
average
nowhere
near
a
real
kölsch
or
even
any
of
the
usclone
kölsches
the
mouthfeel
is
like
the
appearance
pretty
deadon
for
the
style
its
light
and
crisp
and
thin
refreshing
overall
i
just
wish
that
the
beer
were
brighter
as
it
is
id
rather
drink
alpine

poured
out
a
clear

some
interesting

combinations
make
this
a
brew
to
try
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
overallgood
selection
for
summer
with
that
sam
adams
would
have
more
of
this
instead
of
filling
variety
packs
with
boston
lager
that
i
can
get
anywhere
o
some
nice
flavors
in
this
beer
it
is
very
well
crafted
to
bring
out
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
fruit
overall
great
beer
to
have
after
a
burger
which
is
what
i
just
did
it
isnt
too
hard
to
drink
and
it
is
quite
tasty

this
beer
it
is
moderately
strong
with
a
solid
taste
and
nice

overall
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
above
average
and
worth
checking
out
not
mind
blowing
however
o
honestly
this
is
the
beer
i
look
forward
to
in
the
summer
if
bbc
released
this
yearround
in
a
sixpack
itd
be
all
id
ever
drink
it
has
all
the
great
kolsch
flavors
i
love
but
the
added
jasmine
launches
this
one
into
the
stratosphere
i
give
it
a
4
out
of
5
overall
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
rjt
maybe
its
the
style
maybe
its
the
beer
either
way
i
have
a
tough
time
liking
it

beer
the
5

abv
makes
it
a
session
candidate
and
one
that
everyone
would
be
a
fan
of
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
clear
yellow
straw
color
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice

smell
is
clove
grass
biscuit
and
some
coriander
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
with
clove
and
biscuit
in
the
start
and
coriander
in
the
finish
body
is
light
nice
amount
of
life
lush
not
dry
and
so
drinkable
this
was
a
great
choice
for
the
summer
mix
pack
it
is
the
best
summer
mix
they
have
put
together
starting
with
the
noble
pilsner
they
should
make
this
their
summer
beer
over
summer
ale
o
the
eastwest
kolsch
is
a
decent
beer
not
too
much
for
the
aroma
and
taste
about
average
for
the
style
could
have
definitely
used
more
flavor
seemed
like
it
was
slightly
watered
down
easily
drinkable
and
sessionable
worth
the
price
of
admission
the
taste
is
different
the
combination
of
jasmine
and
the
hops
makes
for
an
interesting
flavor
which
seems
to
complement
nicely
there
is
a
bit
of
a
citrus
note
with
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
good
slight
oily
feeling
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
one
this
came
out
of
the
summer
sampler
and
was
by
far
the
best
of
the
bunch
would
rather
have
this
as
their
summer
seasonal
than
their
summer
brew
nice
white
head
on
the
pour
smell
is
biscuity
and
fruit
with
some
spice
flavor
is
somewhat
hoppy
and
sweet
nice
and
refreshing
could
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
its
actually
not
that
bad
of
a
kolsch
i
would
recommend
this
for
sure
o
glad
this
was
in
the
summer
pack
as
id
not
have
tried
it
otherwise
solid
beer
a
nice
light
summer
beer
overall
i
havent
bought
a
case
of
a
single
s
a
brew
in
a
whilebut
in
the
summer
heat
we
had
this
year
i
could
see
quenching
a
thirst
with
this
kolsch
nightly
my
pour
into
another
of
my
perfect
pint
glasses
not
only
produced
two
rocky
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
but
it
showcased
a
beautiful
beer
it
was
a
bright
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
lots
of
bubbles
like
a
poor
mans
lava
lamp
nose
had
a
sweetish
cereallike
quality
malty
but
not
cloying
with
an
underlying
perfumelike
scent
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
the
taste
was
unlike
any
kolsch
in
my
memory
it
was
semidry
which
is
standard
but
it
had
a
perfumey
sweetness
that
reminded
me
of
herbal
tea
wild
the
more
i
drank
this
beer
the
more
the
semidry
sweetness
of
the
malt
commingled
with
the
flowery
perfuminess
of
the
jasmine
sambac
and
i
just
could
not
reconcile
this
as
a
kolsch
the
finish
was
semidry
and
refreshing
but
i
just
kept
thinking
of
it
as
more
of
a
summer
beer
not
bad
interesting
but
should
be
a
summer
seasonal
the
aroma
was
rather
bright
and
summer
like
with
a
light
grain
and
herb
like
fruit
note
in
the
nose
a
touch
of
clove
and
banana
highlighted
this
one
and
really
did
a
nice
job
at
bringing
the
whole
thing
together
the
flavor
was
much
of
the
same
surprisingly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
maybe
honey
or
light
caramel
hints
of
apple
and
light
fresh
hay
the
banana
coming
though
nicely
on
the
finish
with
a
quick
clean
and
very
crisp
cutoff
in
the
overall
taste
overall
this
is
decent
fare
though
i
cant
honestly
say
that
i
would
have
known
of
the
jasmine
sambac
addition
if
it
hadnt
been
pointed
out
to
me
on
the
label
it
doesnt
help
that
the
floral
notes
are
so
delicate
that
theyre
easily
overpowered
by
even
the
moderate
grain
flavors
and
in
subsequent
mouthfuls
are
almost
entirely
subsumed
still
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
developed
and
the
apricot
and
orange
notes
are
delicious
dhonestly
this
is
one
the
least
enjoyable
of
the
kolsch
that
ive
had
feel
is
way
too
dry
and
the
hops
seem
to
take
over
this
one
o
this
isnt
a
bad
kolsch
nice
and
fruity
with
a
good
buiscuit
taste
the
smell
could
be
better
but
it
isnt
bad
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
as
with
the
finish
i
really
enjoy
the
flavors
of
this
beer
it
is
light
slightly
fruity
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
interesting
take
the
eastern
influence
is
very
clear
in
the
taste
with
distinct
notes
of
jasmine
tea
this
is
a
very
floral
beer
with
tons
of
honey
this
beers
got
honey
like
a
bee
hive
theres
a
ton
of
sweetness
that
i
wish
was
cut
with
some
bitterness
but
theres
not
really
any
hops
bitterness
just
the
floral
notes
this
would
be
good
with
some
bitter
honey
but
overall
for
me
its
too
sweet
though
interesting
overall
surprising
complexity
led
to
a
satisfactory
beer
sammy
making
a
kolsch
nice
looks
pretty
with
a
brilliant
golden
hue
head
was
a
little
weak
even
with
some
encouragement
smells
sweet
and
grainy
taste
is
similarly
sweet
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
good
if
a
little
underwhelming
a
solid
beer
overall
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
it
in
six
packs
i
like
kolsch
beers
but
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
dry
finish
session
beer
for
sure
the
east
west
kolsch
pours
well
with
a
good
head
its
color
is
golden
amber
nice
and
clear
but
the
smell
is
lacking
the
taste
is
very
strait
forward
beer
in
a
good
way
its
got
a
decent
amount
of
hop
with
some
toasted
malt
in
it
afterwards
you
can
still
taste
the
beer
sticking
to
your
teeth
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
can
imagine
sitting
on
a
porch
and
drinking
in
thousand
degree
summers
listening
to
baseball
games
now
while
watching
always
sunny
in
philadelphia
it
works
just
as
well
very
good
taste
not
approaching
the
greatness
of
summits
kolsch
but
this
is
a
good
example
overall
i
was
fairly
impressed
with
sam
adams
summer
series
a
few
winners
in
there
do
refreshing
but
i
feel
there
are
better
kölsch
examples
out
there
having
said
that
id
take
this
over
an
adjunct
any
day
least
favorite
out
of
the
summer
variety
pack
overall
a
likable
beer
and
possibly
my
first
adventure
into
the
style
kolsch
started
out
as
a
plain
jane
but
got
surprisingly
drinkable
light
body
and
soft
on
the
palate
great
summer
beer
and
a
great
representation
for
the
style
im
actually
impressed
with
this
one
o
great
session
beer
could
easily
kick
a
few
of
these
back
pours
golden
yellow
with
not
much
of
a
head
aroma
of
wheat
grass
lemon
and
hints
of
floral
hops
light
sweet
and
crisp
flavor
lemon
grass
sweetness
good
tea
like
floral
notes
and
just
a
touch
of
pepper
spice
to
finish
well
crafted
flavor
nice
session
beer
o
this
is
a
decent
brew
although
not
on
par
with
what
sam
usually
serves
up
the
flavor
is
good
but
the
mouthfeel
and
overall
experience
for
me
was
just
ok
give
it
a
try
though
because
it
is
a
good
beer
but
maybe
not
for
me
i
have
no
idea
why
this
beer
is
so
different
from
the
one
i
had
yesterday
colder
that
all
said
you
dont
be
impressed
by
this
you
dont
fall
in
love
but
on
a
hot
enough
day
you
might
be
pretty
happy
to
have
a
glass
or
3
doesnt
challenge
the
taste
buds
but
a
good
kolsch
really
shouldnt
this
is
light
and
refreshing
and
the
subtle
flavors
that
are
there
are
pretty
damn
good
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
color
is
pale
golden
the
head
is
short
lived
though
which
lowered
its
appearance
points
the
aroma
is
indeed
jasmine
floral
crisp
refreshing
definately
a
good
summer
quencher
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
kolsch
style
this
is
only
my
second
but
i
can
tell
you
that
its
not
as
good
as
the
reissdorf
i
had
on
monday
id
say
its
still
worth
trying
ive
had
jasmine
rice
before
and
i
was
expecting
that
taste
and
i
definitely
got
it
the
sweet
wheat
like
malt
really
balances
out
the
flowery
taste
and
gives
it
some
sweetness
the
sweetness
really
breaks
up
the
taste
and
makes
for
a
complex
subtle
beer
samuel
adams
is
really
good
at
making
subtle
beers
that
are
unique
not
too
subtle
though
because
they
make
some
tasty
beers
this
one
being
one
of
them
excellent
summer
beer
got
this
as
part
of
sams
summer
mix
case
pours
clear
gold
with
fluffy
white
head
and
ample
carbonation
smells
bready
and
wheaty
a
little
doughy
with
some
faint
melon
aroma
tastes
sweet
and
citrus
like
a
little
medium
bodied
was
expecting
something
a
little
crisper
and
more
refreshing
a
decent
beer
and
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
a
solid
summer
beer
that
holds
true
to
the
style
what
impresses
me
most
is
the
quality
of
aroma
and
flavor
in
a
lighter
beer
overall
a
well
rounded
wheat
beer
goes
great
with
grilling
and
a
hot
summer
evening
appearance
is
clear
golden
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
there
is
a
definite
spice
to
the
nose
along
with
some
floral
scents
the
taste
is
a
subtle
blend
of
spice
and
hop
notes
nothing
over
the
top
has
a
crisp
finish
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
overall
this
beer
really
had
a
nice
well
balanced
taste
it
works
well
with
the
summer
weather
and
is
very
drinkable
id
buy
this
one
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
bright
light
watery
golden
yellow
color
very
vibrant
and
crisp
a
small
low
profile
white
head
lots
of
steady
small
bubbled
carbonation
consistent
throughout
the
beer
the
nose
is
toasted
oats
and
a
slight
honey
character
as
well
there
are
hints
of
sour
in
the
nose
also
the
beer
leaves
a
lacing
along
the
glass
while
you
drink
the
flavors
are
rich
and
round
with
a
toasty
character
that
borders
on
char
but
goes
great
with
the
sweet
honey
undertone
the
beer
is
only
slightly
hopped
but
enough
to
keep
it
very
crisp
the
aftertaste
is
a
tangy
sweet
with
a
slick
feeling
to
it
the
finish
remains
slick
and
watery
too
leaving
a
slight
linger
of
sweet
and
spice
not
bad
overall
great
on
a
scorching
summer
day
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
did
leave
some
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
aroma
has
notes
of
bready
malt
floral
and
sweet
honey
notes
the
taste
starts
sweet
with
honey
then
has
some
bready
flavors
from
the
malt
and
finishes
with
the
floral
notes
of
jasmine
mostly
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
cloying
for
my
taste
overall
a
pretty
good
kolsch
d
a
refreshing
pleasant
drinking
brew
nicely
different
and
characterful
without
straying
too
far
from
the
style
people
will
either
like
the
herbal
touch
or
not
i
find
it
quite
alright
and
near
perfect
for
some
summer
variety
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
i
just
loved
the
clean
taste
to
it
perfect
for
the
summer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
has
some
mild
hops
not
over
powering
a
tad
bit
of
malts
taste
is
refreshing
hops
some
biscuty
flavors
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
easy
drinking
summer
beer
dr
a
simple
but
very
effective
and
carefully
built
beer
this
is
one
to
enjoy
on
a
patio
over
good
conversation
in
the
summertime
bravo
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
some
fruity
yeast
esters
its
light
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
pilsnerpale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
fruity
yeast
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
nothing
too
great
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
maybe
leaning
more
towards
medium
for
the
style
than
lighter
it
is
modestly
carbonated
and
lively
on
the
tongue
fairly
easy
drinking
but
not
the
best
example
of
a
kolsch
i
have
had
worth
a
try
once
but
not
something
i
would
repeatedly
go
for
after
writing
this
review
i
looked
back
at
the
bottle
to
see
what
the
explanation
was
for
the
labeling
of
eastwest
i
was
expecting
to
read
something
about
the
berlin
wall
no
dice
a
highly
sessionable
brew
as
would
be
expected
of
the
style
a
tremendously
drinkable
crowd
pleasing
brew
perfect
to
drink
with
summer
time
light
fair
seafood
salads
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
small
12
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
small
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grains
flowers
and
spicy
herbal
hops
taste
is
of
sweet
grain
floral
notes
and
a
slightly
spicy
citrus
zest
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
very
mild
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
kolsch
with
a
nice
flavor
from
the
jasmine
sambac
flowers
that
were
added
to
the
beer
this
one
probably
represents
the
style
to
the
best
of
boston
beers
ability
i
personally
dont
prefer
the
kölsch
style
and
probably
shouldnt
have
reviewed
it
goes
good
with
pizza
this
one
was
better
than
their
attempt
at
a
saison
for
what
its
worth
overall
i
enjoyed
every
drop
of
this
brew
very
interesting
and
complex
flavor
seems
like
a
true
and
quality
representation
of
the
kolsch
style
would
like
to
have
many
times
in
the
future
had
a
pint
at
the
batdorf
in
anville
pa
its
does
have
sort
of
the
sulfury
mineral
character
of
a
good
kolsch
but
the
overall
character
is
just
too
light
theres
nothing
technically
wrong
with
it
aside
from
being
muted
that
said
it
was
still
a
fine
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
the
only
other
kolsch
ive
reviewed
thus
far
is
the
reissdorf
kolsch
which
i
view
as
much
better
o
an
excellent
beer
to
enjoy
out
on
the
patio
in
the
summer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
creamy
white
head
aromas
of
bready
sweet
malt
crackers
and
herbal
minty
hops
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
closely
theres
a
nice
toasted
quality
that
lingers
for
a
bit
lightbodied
with
crisp
carbonation
a
solidly
sessionable
kolsch
very
nice
for
a
hot
day
overall
another
great
beer
for
the
summer
im
thinking
this
12
pack
is
worth
buying
every
summer
definitely
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
moreys
bottom
line
if
they
made
this
available
in
sixers
id
grab
one
every
summer
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
thin
head
and
little
lacing
not
a
lot
on
the
nose
yeast
and
malt
taste
is
very
light
dry
yeasty
malt
with
maybe
a
note
of
peach
i
get
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
light
quenching
and
drinkable
refreshing
and
sessionable
overall
a
good
version
of
a
kolsch
from
sam
that
is
very
easy
drinking
could
of
got
a
little
more
from
the
hops
o
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
i
am
coming
around
to
the
style
although
this
beer
is
slightly
different
than
the
average
kolsch
overall
medlium
overall
maybe
just
not
my
thing
i
have
to
try
some
more
of
this
style
drink
one
and
you
will
likely
have
another
lower
abv
than
many
kolsch
beers
make
this
a
good
choice
for
a
barbeque
or
picnic
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
craft
beer
enjoyment
by
itself
completely
underwhelming
but
with
spicy
food
it
was
a
very
complimentary
beer
o
came
in
the
sampler
wasnt
expecting
much
actually
not
a
bad
beer
the
best
one
in
the
pack
i
think
overall
is
is
a
decent
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
could
see
my
friends
who
are
not
into
craft
beer
liking
it
serving
type
bottle
from
the
summer
styles
12
pack
wow
im
truly
surprised
sam
adams
made
a
beer
that
is
delicious
refreshing
sessionable
and
true
to
style
thanks
bmiller
o
overall
this
is
quite
the
session
beer
but
i
had
wished
for
more
from
the
alsation
hops
still
its
a
very
drinkable
summer
brew
and
the
use
of
the
jasmine
flower
is
very
subtle
and
delicately
done
probably
the
most
refreshing
beer
in
the
summer
variety
pack
thus
far
and
great
for
the
heat
wave
we
have
had
recently
drinkability
is
awesome
a
very
refreshing
beer
but
with
a
really
nice
taste
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
weekend
long
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
drink
it
down
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
clear
golden
with
a
thick
white
lasting
head
and
slight
carbonation
grassy
hops
aroma
with
slight
malty
notes
in
the
background
herbal
hops
flavor
dominate
over
biscuit
malt
almost
medicine
bitterness
some
hints
of
lemon
fruit
light
to
medium
smooth
body
long
very
dry
finish
i
think
sa
overdid
it
with
all
that
flower
additions
future
outlook
a
better
than
average
summer
sessionesque
beer
wouldnt
pour
it
down
the
drain
if
another
one
were
to
magically
appear
in
my
fridge
overall
is
ok
its
not
bad
and
easy
to
drink
its
just
boring
this
style
is
just
boring
im
in
a
search
to
find
a
kolsch
thats
a
step
above
others
i
think
many
people
agree
as
ive
seen
an
avg
low
rating
for
many
beers
in
the
style
i
found
it
more
enjoyable
while
it
was
a
bit
chilled
rather
than
when
it
started
to
warm
overall
is
was
good
and
very
refreshing
but
nothing
special
overalla
style
ive
grown
to
love
this
version
is
just
ok
i
had
hoped
for
more
i
continue
to
believe
that
due
to
the
nature
and
lightness
of
the
style
kolsch
only
truly
shines
in
fresh
draft
form
this
version
is
ok
as
an
introduction
to
the
style
but
nothing
more
overall
this
was
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
for
a
hot
and
humid
miami
day
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
stuff
every
day
o
while
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
were
not
exceptional
they
were
more
than
respectable
they
combine
with
the
appearance
and
texture
to
make
a
very
enjoyable
dare
i
say
very
drinkable
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
bright
golden
straw
color
with
a
full
frothy
2
finger
white
head
that
settles
to
a
1
finger
cap
the
aroma
is
strong
of
citrus
and
pine
along
with
slight
malt
tones
the
flavor
is
a
fresh
punch
with
good
lemon
zing
and
a
nice
light
bitter
finish
could
use
a
little
more
malt
to
balance
the
front
of
the
brew
but
i
was
surprisingly
delighted
with
the
overall
complexity
of
this
brew
nice
carbonation
makes
all
the
flavors
pop
didnt
know
this
was
in
my
summer
sampler
but
was
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
go
find
a
12
pack
of
it
o
really
think
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
really
happy
sam
adams
gave
it
a
solid
shot
o
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
from
sam
adams
not
my
favorite
from
them
but
not
offensive
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
o
1st
time
with
a
kolsch
and
pretty
impressed
a
great
sunday
throw
down
brew
o
first
time
with
a
kolsch
and
pretty
well
pleased
would
love
to
have
this
again
have
only
seen
this
as
part
of
the
summer
sampler
hope
to
see
it
as
its
own
6pack
soon
o
a
great
summertime
beer
complex
enough
to
think
about
yet
very
subtle
as
well
allowing
you
to
just
sit
back
and
drink
it
o
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
well
some
things
i
kinda
liked
about
this
beer
but
not
enough
to
buy
it
over
any
other
beer
of
this
style
or
even
similar
styles
crystal
clear
light
golden
body
moderate
amounts
of
carbonation
are
noted
streaming
through
the
body
a
nice
creamy
white
head
leaves
some
nice
lace
as
well
aroma
is
qutie
light
even
for
a
kolsch
light
malts
dusty
malt
flavor
with
some
lightly
rustic
hop
accents
not
a
lot
going
on
here
even
for
a
kolsch
light
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
that
great
either
d
hands
down
the
gem
out
of
this
sam
adams
summer
variety
pack
i
would
love
to
see
this
one
alone
in
sixers
far
as
my
memory
serves
me
this
may
be
the
best
american
kolsch
ive
had
to
date
floral
hops
that
i
usually
associate
with
the
style
are
replaced
here
by
spicier
grassier
lemonier
alt
spalt
somethings
and
that
tamed
floral
edge
is
instead
provided
by
actual
florals
i
like
it
lower
the
abv
a
half
of
a
percent
and
this
would
be
a
humdinger
othis
is
a
style
i
have
come
to
enjoy
and
i
have
yet
to
find
anyone
close
to
summits
unchained
kolsch
of
last
summer
this
one
just
lacks
a
malt
dimension
i
look
for
not
saying
it
needs
to
be
heavy
handed
on
the
malt
side
of
things
but
i
want
a
soft
delicate
malt
flavor
to
be
detectable
and
this
doesnt
have
that
it
is
ok
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
poured
this
kolsch
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
nice
clear
strawgolden
color
it
produced
a
nice
thick
white
creamy
head
very
nice
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
beer
had
soft
suggestions
of
grain
malt
and
had
a
nice
floral
hop
smell
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
very
refreshing
great
mouthfeel
and
light
in
body
perfect
summer
beer
for
someone
looking
for
a
nice
alternative
to
american
lager
nice
malt
base
some
spiciness
that
quite
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
finish
has
traces
of
floral
hops
and
it
finishs
dry
encouraging
me
to
follow
up
with
another
gulp
as
far
as
the
kolsch
style
goes
this
gets
top
marks
another
very
good
beer
from
sam
adams
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
maybe
not
my
top
pick
for
kölsch
beers
still
not
bad
tasting
and
interesting
in
their
interpretation
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
nice
clear
yellow
color
the
head
looks
good
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
has
a
light
floral
aroma
and
some
honey
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
also
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
its
a
pretty
good
kölsch
style
rather
enjoyable
for
the
summer
season
o
not
anything
outstanding
but
a
curious
style
that
works
well
in
the
summer
o
its
not
special
but
not
totally
forgettable
ill
drink
it
again
and
i
have
no
qualms
quaffing
this
on
a
hot
day
o
an
impressive
offering
from
boston
beer
company
flavorful
sessionable
and
very
drinkable
o
a
real
let
down
from
sam
adams
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
enjoyable
glass
of
kolsch
and
thats
not
what
i
got
d
an
enjoyable
beer
on
a
hot
evening
jasmine
flavor
is
a
bit
heavy
but
it
is
enjoyable
pours
out
to
a
golden
body
with
some
good
retention
fine
lacing
and
good
carbonation
it
has
a
flowery
slightly
grainy
aroma
to
it
the
taste
has
a
sweet
fruity
taste
to
it
apples
and
grapes
along
with
a
floral
taste
and
a
slight
hops
taste
at
the
end
it
does
have
some
balance
to
it
but
overall
it
has
a
sweet
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
and
light
bodied
which
is
not
bad
for
a
summer
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
these
hot
summer
days
crystal
clear
golden
beer
fluffy
white
head
that
is
relatively
shortlived
this
beer
is
a
great
summer
brew
mildly
grainy
aroma
slight
pilsnerlike
very
pale
malt
aroma
some
fruit
apple
a
bit
of
yeast
and
sulpher
but
not
much
hop
aroma
clean
and
flavorful
taste
very
good
balance
sweetish
malt
in
the
front
slightly
dry
in
the
finish
very
clean
and
refreshing
o
too
much
jasmine
too
little
kolsch
i
like
out
of
the
box
beers
but
this
one
over
did
it
on
the
spice
good
idea
bad
execution
a
nice
attempt
but
whatever
the
brewer
added
to
the
steep
is
not
in
the
norm
which
is
not
always
bad
but
this
adds
nothing
to
an
already
wonderful
style
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
the
color
was
rich
and
golden
the
smell
was
nothing
fancy
the
taste
however
is
really
smooth
at
first
but
at
the
end
there
is
a
parade
of
complexities
there
is
a
richness
that
comes
through
at
the
end
that
is
pretty
nice
its
hard
to
pinpoint
the
flavor
but
i
like
it
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
hearty
finish
wow
this
is
the
worst
kolsch
ive
had
to
date
tastes
nothing
like
it
but
an
appeal
to
keep
adjunct
lager
drinkers
perhaps
unchallenged
without
upseting
them
pass
overall
i
have
never
had
the
savor
flowers
but
this
seems
to
be
a
cheaper
version
in
the
same
vain
having
just
enough
sweet
flavors
to
make
it
interesting
i
also
have
the
saison
and
cant
wait
to
try
it
o
this
beer
sound
very
nice
on
the
bottle
but
it
didnt
come
through
that
way
in
the
glass
it
was
a
bit
to
sweet
to
make
it
crisp
and
refreshing
and
too
light
to
make
it
interesting
enough
to
want
another
glass
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
most
bland
beers
i
think
ive
ever
had
im
sorely
disappointed
i
think
sam
adams
needs
to
take
note
from
my
kolsch
brewing
skills
just
let
me
know
sam
adams
and
ill
see
if
i
can
find
that
brewkit
recipe
card
for
you
d
overall
its
a
nice
beer
and
a
pretty
decent
kolsch
nice
mix
of
flavors
and
feel
with
a
decent
abv
very
drinkable
very
nice
take
on
the
style
not
bad
but
not
amazing
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
bottle
if
offered
but
this
is
something
i
wouldnt
seek
out
overall
this
is
a
major
miss
for
me
and
even
on
a
nice
hot
night
was
a
drain
pour
because
the
flavor
profile
just
didnt
mesh
for
me
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
had
a
nice
golden
lager
appearance
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
for
a
while
not
much
smell
going
on
here
just
standard
malty
scent
mouthfeel
was
above
average
nothing
offensive
taste
was
dry
and
not
much
bitter
no
one
taste
aspect
really
stood
out
as
this
beer
was
sharpdry
tasting
and
really
just
beery
this
beer
was
very
smooth
and
one
i
would
call
a
good
summer
beer
pretty
pedestrian
and
ill
pass
on
this
next
time
seriously
not
much
better
then
any
standard
basic
beer
at
a
local
restaurant
overall
decent
for
a
massproduced
version
touches
but
doesnt
accomplish
everything
but
far
from
a
disappointment
i
dug
it
oa
quality
entry
into
the
style
by
samuel
adams
this
was
part
of
the
summer
mix
and
worth
the
purchase
poured
a
clear
sparkling
pale
yellow
with
a
large
foamy
head
that
had
fair
retention
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
extremely
light
of
grain
malts
a
flowery
hop
and
a
moldy
yeast
with
a
mild
citrus
note
it
tasted
very
very
light
and
airy
with
a
hint
of
citrus
in
the
beginning
and
finished
a
bit
sour
with
a
very
light
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
was
very
light
in
body
and
quite
watery
in
texture
with
a
lively
carbonation
overall
a
real
disappointment
for
a
kölsch
the
brew
master
in
my
opinion
really
dropped
the
ball
on
this
one
overall
its
not
as
though
i
think
this
is
terribleid
certainly
drink
it
over
many
big
brews
if
it
was
lighter
it
might
be
refreshing
but
it
isnt
light
its
just
not
something
that
i
would
choose
to
drink
over
other
sam
products
really
surprised
by
this
one
i
thought
the
flowers
would
overpower
or
it
would
be
overhopped
instead
this
is
very
balanced
light
and
tasty
this
is
the
first
of
the
two
new
brews
featured
in
the
summer
styles
variety
pack
and
it
hit
the
spot
for
sure
last
years
summer
sampler
was
almost
perfect
however
its
becoming
harder
and
harder
to
find
sa
pale
ale
i
dont
know
if
sa
wants
to
stay
traditional
but
there
has
to
be
more
refreshing
light
styles
that
have
a
little
more
hops
than
usual
theres
no
reason
why
pale
ale
cant
be
brewed
all
year
it
beats
cherry
wheat
for
sure
well
see
how
the
rustic
saison
ranks
up
as
well
as
far
as
this
beer
goes
its
very
refreshing
for
this
california
heat
and
puts
a
nice
euro
twist
on
your
everyday
drinker
as
i
said
i
wish
these
beer
were
available
more
often
stay
thirsty
my
friends
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
bright
straw
yellow
body
with
just
a
little
creamy
white
head
the
smell
has
a
nice
maltiiness
and
some
floral
hints
to
it
the
taste
is
very
light
and
refreshing
with
some
floral
tastes
on
the
front
and
a
little
bitter
hops
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
great
mouth
feel
smooth
just
a
little
carbonated
i
could
drink
this
all
summer
long
it
isnt
the
most
complicated
or
eccentric
brew
but
it
is
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
id
say
next
to
the
rustic
saison
this
is
the
most
refreshing
samuel
adams
in
the
summer
variety
pack
and
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
one
worth
thinking
about
going
home
to
after
work
during
work
o
i
like
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
i
would
like
them
to
be
a
bit
more
prominant
i
could
certainly
turn
to
this
one
for
a
good
summer
session
beer
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
contans
a
harvesty
corn
like
aromas
and
pepper
smells
the
taste
was
strong
a
good
amount
of
spices
good
carbonation
a
floral
taste
and
smell
strong
flavor
for
this
style
overall
very
good
pours
clear
and
golden
very
carbonated
with
plenty
of
fizzy
white
head
light
malty
aroma
with
plenty
of
fruit
and
caramel
notes
bready
malty
flavor
with
a
slight
hop
bite
and
bitterness
typical
sam
adams
fare
a
smooth
easy
drinker
nothing
special
but
perfectly
adequate
this
would
be
a
great
summer
session
beer
for
a
day
anywhere
from
the
lake
to
sitting
at
the
house
after
mowing
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
pretty
darn
drinkable
this
goes
down
easy
but
not
too
easy
that
the
flavor
skids
right
by
there
is
a
delayed
craft
feel
to
this
beer
that
is
nice
but
also
very
easy
so
that
this
could
be
enjoyed
many
times
in
a
row
without
problems
a
good
session
beer
for
the
summer
one
of
the
more
impressive
specialty
beers
from
samuel
adams
ive
had
the
kolsch
style
is
a
hard
one
to
find
so
this
might
be
a
beer
i
look
for
in
the
future
overall
this
beer
was
a
complete
train
wreck
for
me
it
brought
back
haunting
memories
of
the
bruerys
orchard
white
another
beer
that
less
than
agreed
with
me
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
ever
oh
well
they
all
cant
be
winners
i
havent
had
a
beer
this
light
for
some
time
so
it
took
a
bit
to
recalibrate
for
a
lighter
style
its
a
pretty
gold
color
with
nice
white
foam
the
aroma
is
wheaty
with
a
bit
of
tartness
the
taste
has
the
same
essence
with
some
additional
citrus
flavor
it
finishes
fairly
smooth
leaving
very
little
aftertaste
its
a
nice
lighter
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
ill
enjoy
the
rest
in
the
case
it
tasted
of
a
light
smooth
wheat
malty
beer
with
a
slight
hopmalt
finish
this
was
the
first
kolsch
i
ever
reviewed
so
i
have
no
idea
if
this
is
considered
a
good
beer
for
the
style
oa
nicely
developed
beer
its
a
fruity
kolsch
and
i
prefer
mine
on
the
clean
side
i
think
this
gives
a
little
bit
of
both
worlds
the
fruitines
shows
up
beginning
palate
and
then
quickly
dries
out
i
think
this
should
replace
summer
ale
m
the
mouthfeel
isnt
half
bad
id
love
to
taste
the
jasmine
sambac
in
more
concentrated
proportions
though
o
went
perfect
with
some
bar
food
easy
drinkin
flavorful
would
love
to
see
this
around
more
often
before
tonight
id
never
heard
of
it
will
have
to
keep
my
eyes
peeled
indeed
overall
boring
taste
okay
looking
but
the
feel
is
probably
the
best
thing
about
the
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
this
again
this
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
better
than
a
lot
of
other
equally
light
beers
you
can
find
but
nothing
spectacular
overall
an
intriguing
twist
on
an
underappreciated
style
i
love
beers
like
this
in
the
summertime
oa
session
beer
a
light
one
for
the
summer
worth
a
try
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
would
be
super
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
its
not
very
flavorful
but
i
could
see
this
being
a
great
transition
beer
for
people
just
getting
into
craft
i
would
drink
this
again
though
very
enjoyable
beer
for
the
summer
the
sa
summertime
mix
pack
always
seems
to
be
the
most
approachable
for
the
noncraft
drinker
and
this
one
fits
in
nicely
but
still
has
plenty
to
offer
for
the
more
discerning
palate
overall
its
pretty
decent
but
not
spectacular
still
a
quite
drinkable
selection
from
their
summer
pack
moderatly
light
with
almost
the
perfect
carbonation
it
clears
the
palate
and
allows
a
fresh
taste
every
time
the
sweetness
of
the
grains
and
the
tangy
hops
make
for
a
refreshing
and
clean
summer
drinker
again
very
subtle
and
clean
hefty
for
style
starts
with
biscuity
pale
malt
hint
of
adjuncts
hop
bite
in
the
middle
with
a
full
floral
finish
easy
drinking
summer
ale
although
its
not
up
my
alley
o
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
drinkable
but
fairly
boring
in
the
end
not
sam
adams
best
by
any
means
but
okay
for
a
hot
day
i
suppose
d
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
complex
or
intriguing
but
a
very
decent
session
beer
cheers
overall
ew
suits
the
summer
styles
sampler
box
a
respectful
nod
was
given
to
the
fiercely
traditional
kölsch
style
while
going
for
some
good
ole
experimentation
by
drypetaling
the
brew
with
jasmine
flowers
brought
over
the
summer
styles
pack
to
a
cookout
on
memorial
day
and
cracked
this
one
first
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
peel
light
soap
sweet
flowers
and
wheat
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemon
peel
orange
zest
wheat
sweet
flowers
and
slightly
faint
light
greens
the
body
is
a
heavyfeeling
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
kolsch
though
i
feel
the
smell
was
just
a
bit
too
faint
and
plain
not
at
all
bad
though
o
tremendous
beer
a
too
rarely
produced
style
done
well
and
large
great
for
a
refreshing
summertime
beer
but
strongspicy
enough
to
have
a
place
in
any
weather
overall
i
wish
sam
adams
would
just
stick
to
making
beer
and
not
adding
unnecessary
weirdness
like
asian
jasmine
overall
its
decent
pours
a
deep
golden
straw
color
with
a
thinnish
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
smells
grainy
herbal
with
hints
of
lemon
and
maybe
apricot
a
bit
of
floral
notes
as
well
taste
is
bready
grassy
citrusy
herbal
creamy
watery
mouthfeel
medium
to
light
body
and
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
light
refreshing
brew
that
seemed
to
go
down
rather
quickly
on
this
hot
day
if
this
was
in
a
six
pack
it
might
make
it
into
the
summer
rotation
my
first
kolsch
style
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
and
i
must
say
i
will
be
experimenting
much
more
with
this
style
of
beer
thanks
to
mr
adams
one
of
the
new
sam
adams
offerings
in
the
summer
variety
pack
always
found
a
kolsch
to
be
an
interesting
style
here
it
goes
pours
a
bubbly
golden
color
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
great
crispness
to
this
beer
nice
clean
finish
super
refreshing
spot
on
with
a
lot
of
the
other
kolschs
ive
had
before
and
definitely
has
that
euro
taste
to
it
a
great
addition
to
a
summer
pack
hopefully
it
stays
around
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
good
wish
they
would
brew
this
all
year
round
overall
somewhere
between
the
boston
lager
and
noble
pils
you
have
the
eastwest
kolsh
definitely
a
nice
goto
summer
or
warm
weather
option
nice
job
jim
light
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
to
it
faint
maltiness
dry
crackers
raw
barley
cereal
grains
apples
easy
going
with
simple
flavors
it
has
some
overall
balance
to
it
light
and
easy
to
drink
sessionable
for
some
didnt
really
notice
the
jasmine
listed
as
an
ingredient
not
my
favorite
kolsch
but
better
than
some
m
3
5
its
easy
on
the
mouth
i
just
think
that
after
several
it
would
feel
as
if
one
was
chewing
on
pot
porri
all
day
hoping
this
one
sticks
around
perfect
summer
beer
much
moreso
than
the
sam
summer
first
sip
has
a
distinct
floral
hoppiness
and
decent
amount
of
lingering
sweetness
not
quite
as
dry
as
id
prefer
still
a
nice
flavor
overall
a
nice
addition
to
the
mix
pack
m
medium
body
oily
and
surprisingly
creamy
a
real
treat
to
drink
could
easily
session
with
this
thanks
to
the
reasonable
abv
faint
haze
light
gold
with
a
short
white
cap
decent
head
retention
and
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
crackery
malt
with
a
sweet
floral
and
spicy
aroma
slight
grassiness
and
mild
lemony
citrus
delicate
bitterness
was
balanced
by
spicy
and
floral
notes
as
well
as
cereal
grain
sweetness
lingering
floral
and
spicy
character
i
found
the
body
too
heavy
for
a
kolsch
it
wasnt
as
crisp
as
i
would
like
more
medium
bodied
than
light
carbonation
was
on
the
creamy
side
overall
i
liked
the
flavours
but
the
mouthfeel
didnt
work
for
me
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
prefer
straight
up
kolschs
if
you
can
find
them
if
not
home
brew
them
because
they
are
a
great
summer
beer
the
beer
was
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
filmy
white
head
that
left
a
ring
of
lacing
after
each
sip
the
aroma
is
mostly
lemon
with
some
hay
and
barely
a
hint
of
jasmine
the
taste
is
grassy
with
lemon
and
orange
with
a
bready
aftertaste
this
beer
is
light
with
prickly
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
after
a
long
stressful
day
an
easy
drinking
beer
no
heavy
flavors
or
alcohol
to
get
in
the
way
of
drinking
a
few
of
these
overall
it
was
decent
but
nothing
stylebreaking
i
saw
this
on
tap
somewhere
for
7
a
pour
and
glad
i
passed
and
had
a
chance
to
grab
a
bottle
for
a
lot
less
easy
drinking
but
lacking
a
little
flavor
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
brew
overall
a
nice
addition
to
the
summer
pack
for
sure
and
i
could
absolutely
see
myself
having
one
in
the
future
a
decent
but
ultimately
uninteresting
kolsch
it
isnt
too
sweet
which
is
a
problem
i
have
with
many
beers
in
this
style
but
it
honestly
doesnt
have
much
flavor
to
it
samuel
adams
eastwest
kölsch
is
a
crystal
clear
pale
golden
ale
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
vanishes
leaving
a
small
white
ring
and
nice
lacing
it
has
an
aroma
of
lemon
and
light
grain
its
light
bodied
and
very
lively
it
leaves
the
mouth
slightly
scratchy
theres
not
really
much
flavor
here
its
a
touch
funky
and
slightly
bitter
theres
almost
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
something
like
herbal
tea
going
on
maybe
thats
the
jasmine
sambac
this
is
not
really
my
thing
even
after
mowing
the
lawn
overall
an
interesting
beer
from
samuel
adams
i
cant
say
its
one
to
seek
out
though
im
enjoying
the
second
one
more
than
i
did
the
first
when
i
drank
it
a
few
days
ago
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
lemony
grassy
the
flavor
is
light
bisquity
there
are
floral
notes
and
hints
of
sweetness
the
body
is
light
good
carbonation
a
decent
kolsh
nothing
exciting
pretty
standard
kolsch
appearance
pale
golden
with
a
fingers
worth
of
head
that
doesnt
retain
for
too
long
the
aroma
is
alright
grains
noble
hops
and
citrus
primarily
the
taste
is
also
pretty
good
its
a
little
lacking
in
intensity
but
otherwise
nice
hops
and
citrus
dominate
until
the
signature
grainy
kolsch
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
brisk
and
wellcarbonated
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
a
solid
kolsch
o
this
is
an
okay
kolschstyle
ale
not
a
lot
of
depth
of
flavors
or
complexities
but
it
is
easy
drinking
since
i
have
no
basis
of
comparison
i
have
to
rate
this
on
its
own
terms
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
one
it
is
a
style
new
to
me
and
one
i
may
have
to
explore
more
this
is
a
fairly
spicy
brew
but
has
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
o
happily
surprised
that
the
asian
jasmine
sambac
doesnt
overpower
this
beer
its
a
very
easy
drinking
good
take
on
kölsch
and
perfect
for
todays
80
plus
temps
o
this
is
not
the
best
in
the
summer
12
pack
but
id
drink
it
again
a
fun
and
totally
drinkable
beer
great
addition
to
the
summer
2011
twelvepack
overall
i
want
six
packs
of
this
like
now
excellent
beer
which
has
summer
and
session
written
all
over
it
layered
and
complex
but
simple
enough
to
kick
back
with
on
a
summer
evening
get
this
brew
while
its
available
the
crisp
dryness
makes
the
mouthfeel
interesting
and
its
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
its
pretty
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
so
that
hampers
the
overall
rating
prost
pillowy
white
head
floating
atop
a
very
pale
gold
coler
brew
i
could
smell
this
one
feet
away
from
the
glass
nice
sweet
malt
and
a
prominant
floral
hops
grainly
malt
front
nice
floral
hop
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
nice
smooth
mouth
sa
did
a
good
job
on
this
one
nice
kolsch
cheers
super
drinkability
a
near
perfect
kolsch
i
could
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
come
summer
time
sa
ew
kolsch
12oz
into
pint
pours
piss
yellow
crystal
clear
with
a
14
white
head
smells
weird
unlike
any
other
kolsch
ive
ever
had
before
a
weird
floral
sweet
note
almost
like
a
apple
jolly
rancher
sits
in
the
background
along
with
the
standard
biscuit
malts
that
i
usually
detect
no
hops
are
present
here
taste
is
close
to
the
nose
with
the
weird
sweet
character
coming
through
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
and
i
probably
will
just
save
the
other
five
from
the
few
cases
i
have
and
pass
them
out
to
family
when
they
are
over
i
truly
dont
think
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
kolsch
style
but
i
guess
a
few
out
there
could
see
this
as
a
mediocre
summer
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
pursue
further
either
pours
a
clear
gold
body
one
finger
of
bright
white
head
has
good
retention
and
lacing
properties
aromas
are
predominantly
grainy
with
strong
notes
of
an
apple
bear
claw
and
small
hints
of
something
that
remind
me
of
the
time
i
drove
through
a
utah
desert
with
the
windows
rolled
down
you
dont
expect
much
in
the
way
of
aromas
from
a
kolsch
and
these
sniffs
are
simple
but
good
in
terms
of
taste
of
weight
this
beer
is
nearly
simple
but
terrifically
enjoyable
if
only
it
had
more
assertivebalancing
hops
it
would
exemplify
everything
that
kolsch
is
intended
to
be
body
is
light
flavors
are
predominantly
lightly
malty
and
devoid
of
challenging
corners
or
anything
even
mildly
offensive
having
tried
several
dozen
kolschs
i
consider
this
to
be
in
the
top
5
of
the
style
overall
fairly
impressed
by
this
kolsch
from
boston
beer
company
before
cracking
it
i
thought
that
this
was
a
style
that
they
could
pull
off
usually
i
am
disappointed
by
sam
adams
beers
not
being
flavorful
enough
well
kolsch
is
supposed
to
be
light
so
it
worked
nicely
this
kolsch
is
as
good
as
any
other
ive
had
to
date
now
if
only
i
didnt
have
to
end
up
with
two
bottles
of
sam
adams
summer
ale
and
blackberry
witbier
to
get
this
cheers
o
my
initial
impressions
are
that
overall
this
one
is
a
little
light
in
the
flavor
department
style
wise
i
prefer
stoudts
offering
but
the
incredible
refreshing
and
crisp
nature
of
this
brew
would
have
me
coming
back
for
another
an
excellent
choice
for
a
session
east
west
kolsch
has
some
interesting
flavors
happening
while
i
can
still
see
a
pretty
ordinary
kolsch
as
the
base
the
added
grain
of
paradise
actually
does
give
the
beer
a
bit
of
a
boost
i
like
how
the
earthypeppery
elements
buoy
the
malt
keeping
it
interesting
and
at
the
same
time
complimenting
the
yeast
which
has
a
mild
german
mustiness
the
malt
is
generally
light
and
inoffensive
but
all
in
all
i
found
this
to
be
something
i
could
see
working
in
a
cookout
setting
midsummer
to
go
with
ribs
or
brats
to
cut
some
grease
and
deliver
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
at
the
same
time
similar
to
a
witbier
othis
is
an
extremely
boring
and
pointless
attempt
from
sam
adams
im
thinking
it
was
their
goal
to
make
a
lawn
mower
beer
this
might
hit
someones
soft
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
mine
its
just
an
average
beer
thats
only
slightly
better
than
bmc
beers
d
this
is
not
really
what
i
expected
i
didnt
notice
the
jasmine
addition
noted
on
the
label
until
i
tasted
the
beer
and
decided
something
was
off
the
jasmine
is
clearly
noticeable
and
it
kind
of
makes
the
beer
taste
more
like
a
saison
than
a
kolsch
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
have
preferred
that
they
just
make
a
traditional
kolsch
instead
i
cant
help
but
think
that
adding
something
like
jasmine
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
one
might
do
when
a
homebrewed
kolsch
turned
out
poorly
and
i
came
up
with
a
last
ditch
idea
to
save
it
this
sam
has
a
nice
round
flavor
that
is
not
overly
complex
it
has
a
nice
aroma
that
i
have
not
smelled
in
recent
beers
i
like
it
it
has
a
nice
clear
color
with
a
smooth
head
when
it
was
poured
it
had
a
nice
feel
in
my
mouth
and
was
rather
smooth
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
o
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
ever
see
myself
wanting
more
then
2
of
these
at
a
time
because
its
pretty
basic
and
simple
would
use
this
beer
to
have
after
i
had
a
heavy
beer
a
good
summerwarm
weather
brew
it
would
be
nice
to
have
more
available
for
one
could
sit
a
spell
with
this
refreshing
kolsch
di
would
rate
this
beer
possibly
a
little
higher
if
it
were
in
the
correct
category
its
a
nice
fruitvegetable
beer
but
not
a
very
good
kolsch
i
prefer
a
little
more
bite
from
the
hops
and
a
touch
bit
more
complexity
in
the
malt
department
o
impressed
liked
this
one
a
lot
getting
into
kolschs
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
so
far
solid
golden
yellow
hue
with
a
fluffy
white
head
soft
fruity
aroma
with
a
light
spicy
hit
of
leafy
hops
and
some
warm
cereal
grain
spicy
crisp
floral
hops
meet
a
crackerlike
maltiness
subtle
biscuit
and
grass
light
bodied
appropriately
bitter
very
refreshing
certainly
a
worthy
addition
to
the
summer
mix
pack
pours
a
transparent
golden
color
with
a
very
visible
carbonation
head
is
about
the
density
of
a
soda
head
when
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
it
rose
to
about
an
34
of
an
inch
this
head
quickly
recedes
leaving
me
with
a
ring
around
my
glass
the
smell
is
of
light
sweet
malts
and
a
slight
floral
smell
upon
first
taste
i
get
that
same
sweet
malt
taste
but
i
also
catch
some
citrus
hops
along
with
the
slight
floral
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
this
is
a
wonderful
substitute
for
your
friends
bmc
it
still
has
the
refreshing
qualities
and
the
abv
is
pretty
reasonable
this
is
what
ill
be
bringing
along
to
drink
with
my
buddies
this
summer
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
fades
fast
the
smell
is
not
very
potent
but
you
get
some
subtle
citrus
and
malt
the
flavor
starts
subtle
and
sweet
with
some
citrus
notes
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
beer
finishes
with
the
floral
notes
and
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
a
great
balance
with
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
great
summer
beer
not
too
much
flavor
but
still
hits
the
spot
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
the
appearance
is
the
weak
spot
a
great
example
of
a
fresh
summertime
light
and
crisp
beer
lots
of
floral
qualities
and
a
hint
of
citrus
in
the
nose
i
smell
an
aroma
of
a
faint
sweet
flower
i
assume
is
jasmine
it
is
subtle
enough
that
the
beer
remains
drinkable
a
subtle
crisp
citrus
touch
with
herbal
and
floral
notes
kind
of
watery
but
goes
with
the
territory
of
a
light
session
beer
nice
malty
background
overall
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
pleasant
and
malty
initially
with
mellow
sweetness
and
just
enough
balance
to
make
it
interesting
clean
tame
finish
that
never
breaks
with
noble
bitterness
like
a
pilsner
or
pale
ale
carbonation
is
very
manageable
extremely
easy
to
put
away
in
quantity
especially
outside
in
the
summer
however
dont
go
looking
for
a
whole
of
of
complexity
here
overall
a
great
example
of
the
kölsch
style
and
an
excellent
summer
seasonal
a
nice
addition
to
the
sam
adams
stable
pours
a
pale
golden
hue
in
the
body
appears
much
like
any
other
quality
kolsch
style
bright
white
fluffy
head
fine
speckled
lacing
surrounds
the
glass
aroma
has
a
biscuit
malt
breadiness
with
hints
of
citrus
and
herbal
hops
with
a
notable
floral
aspect
clean
drinking
kolsch
style
beer
with
hints
of
breadiness
grassy
mild
citrus
hops
with
a
kiss
of
flower
additions
going
on
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
sturdy
carbonation
going
strong
with
a
effervescent
texture
backend
overall
not
bad
tastes
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
the
rustic
saison
satisfied
my
tastes
buds
much
more
though
would
recommend
this
one
and
sam
adams
can
stick
a
feather
in
his
hat
enjoy
one
of
these
while
sitting
outside
taking
in
the
sun
very
strange
beer
to
review
poured
out
to
a
golden
strawish
color
nice
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
dominant
scent
when
breathing
it
in
is
breadgrain
taking
a
taste
the
hop
spice
is
what
definitely
hits
you
first
not
hard
but
it
is
what
one
notices
after
a
few
more
sips
the
citrus
notes
start
to
kick
in
the
flavors
definitely
develop
as
you
get
further
into
it
there
is
still
an
aftertaste
i
cant
quite
name
that
throws
off
the
finishing
balance
but
it
doesnt
stay
with
you
as
you
continue
all
in
all
a
decent
summer
beer
overall
not
worth
the
extra
an
absolutely
spectacular
quaffer
with
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
perhaps
not
exactly
to
style
though
the
addition
of
jasimine
sambac
flowers
prevents
that
from
the
getgo
but
certainly
wellexecuted
and
a
perfect
beer
for
summertime
drinking
boston
beer
co
may
want
to
consider
bringing
this
out
as
a
replacement
for
the
venerable
summer
ale
o
d
its
a
tasty
beer
id
drink
it
and
the
rest
of
this
twelver
for
the
summer
probably
m
light
body
without
being
watery
medium
light
carbonation
for
the
style
a
quaffable
brew
with
enough
character
to
keep
one
interested
and
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
yellowgold
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
wheat
and
grain
with
not
too
much
else
going
on
the
flavor
is
more
exciting
i
get
some
grain
and
grass
notes
as
well
as
some
bready
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
grape
characteristics
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
decent
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
great
summer
beer
o
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
ever
see
myself
wanting
more
then
2
of
these
at
a
time
a
nice
refreshing
beer
with
no
real
strengths
or
weakness
wish
the
would
drop
the
mediocre
summer
ale
and
make
this
the
summer
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
in
color
good
foam
and
alittle
lace
stickage
smells
of
biscuity
malts
some
fresh
baked
bread
and
doughy
notes
in
the
flavor
crisp
clean
bready
malts
once
again
dominate
alittle
herbal
hop
presence
but
mainly
light
malty
and
refreshing
a
very
solid
kolsch
and
tastes
like
many
imports
only
fresher
i
cant
say
it
disappointing
cuz
its
fine
but
its
typical
of
several
sa
beers
of
being
underwhelming
overall
a
nicely
drinkable
very
decent
beer
i
like
the
combination
of
jasmine
and
kölsch
it
makes
for
a
greatly
refreshing
brew
this
jewel
was
in
the
summer
styles
12
pack
regretfully
there
are
only
two
all
i
can
say
is
wow
the
pour
into
my
pilsner
glass
reveals
a
wellcarbonated
pale
yellow
brew
with
a
billowing
fluffy
white
head
the
aromas
is
grainy
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
grassiness
taste
is
true
to
stylelight
and
refreshinga
little
grainy
with
a
smooth
hop
finish
jim
please
make
these
available
in
12
packs
medium
bodied
carbonation
on
the
light
side
of
medium
im
thinking
this
has
a
great
mouth
feel
and
man
this
is
so
easy
a
brew
to
drink
colour
me
impressed
i
have
3
more
bottles
that
i
can
enjoy
d
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
kölsch
style
nor
of
the
boston
beer
companys
more
gimmicky
offerings
but
this
was
something
that
was
definitely
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
they
should
make
this
available
outside
the
summer
variety
pack
o
overall
i
cant
really
imagine
a
much
better
kolsch
this
beer
is
wonderful
for
a
hot
day
and
can
go
well
with
any
food
intensely
easy
to
drink
with
some
complexity
but
overall
it
is
best
described
as
refreshing
and
delicious
pours
an
almost
crystal
clear
light
yellowgold
a
white
foamy
head
rears
back
but
stays
a
quarterinch
and
patches
the
glass
smell
is
fresh
biscuity
lemony
and
strawlike
sugary
many
smells
very
complex
right
away
i
get
the
smoothness
of
honey
then
the
typical
sour
backend
of
the
kolsch
a
sweetness
tries
to
break
thru
but
doesnt
quite
achieve
it
a
bit
of
spice
on
the
finish
feel
is
sorta
like
a
cut
wine
yes
there
is
a
floralness
about
this
brew
as
well
an
odd
choice
of
ingredients
makes
for
a
unique
pour
nice
final
notes
this
beer
just
really
isnt
my
style
its
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
lacks
some
character
and
depth
overall
this
to
me
is
an
average
beer
and
of
sam
adams
special
offerings
this
is
with
the
coastal
wheat
as
the
least
impressive
of
the
bunch
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
enough
to
jump
out
has
the
characteristics
of
sam
adams
beers
crisp
but
this
is
a
miss
for
for
me
o
this
beer
was
reviewed
as
a
herbspice
beer
as
it
is
obvious
from
the
description
on
the
bottle
the
floral
presence
is
out
front
in
this
beer
and
lends
itself
well
to
the
kölsch
style
the
floral
taste
really
lends
itself
to
a
false
noble
hop
flavor
which
make
it
work
well
enough
d
a
nice
refreshing
beer
but
sweeter
than
anticipated
o
easy
to
drink
tasty
and
very
refreshing
grainy
and
bready
with
a
light
sweetness
not
too
shabby
i
am
glad
the
jasmine
does
not
impart
much
of
a
flavor
the
yeast
is
not
as
prominent
as
i
would
like
but
there
is
still
an
influence
at
least
good
easy
drinking
with
a
little
bit
of
character
and
a
crisp
finish
a
pretty
good
effort
from
the
bbc
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
in
standalone
format
o
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
doesnt
offer
much
more
than
that
for
me
in
fact
i
think
i
would
rather
have
a
pale
ale
or
a
pilsner
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
style
ill
have
to
try
more
in
the
future
i
think
its
worth
a
try
though
especially
because
it
currently
comes
in
a
mix
pack
of
other
refreshing
brews
for
the
summer
cheers
fairly
carbonated
but
still
drinks
very
smooth
light
and
refreshing
good
not
great
o
a
refreshing
beer
that
does
have
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
that
would
be
good
on
a
summer
day
everything
meshes
well
together
the
word
i
would
use
to
best
describe
this
beer
is
crisp
o
overall
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
nice
and
complex
enough
and
stay
really
balanced
throughout
really
enjoyable
balance
just
wish
it
had
a
tad
more
body
o
very
good
beer
first
kolsch
ive
had
but
im
guessing
it
holds
true
to
the
style
makes
me
want
to
try
more
kolsch
style
brews
overall
this
is
a
very
good
summer
beer
this
mix
pack
is
surprisingly
good
o
the
beer
does
fit
the
style
well
though
not
anything
i
would
run
out
and
buy
unless
i
was
having
a
big
cook
out
and
want
to
serve
an
unpretentious
well
brewed
quaffer
this
is
one
style
we
dont
see
enough
of
so
hats
off
to
sam
adams
for
bringing
back
a
beer
that
many
brewers
often
overlook
12oz

goldenyellow
with

5
inch
head
that
eventually
settles
into
a
thin
band
around
the
edges
some
residual
spots
of
lacing
present
during
the
session
copious
tiny
bubbles
are
evident
effervescing
in
solution
very
clean
nose
the
merest
suggestion
of
citrus
lemon
and
a
light
bready
quality
taste
follows
nose
bready
quality
is
much
sweeter
and
comes
to
the
forefront
with
the
citrus
character
lightly
interweaving
itself
throughout
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
a
pleasant
even
carbonation
a
very
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
domestic
kolsch
would
love
to
see
this
added
to
the
regular
summer
lineup
oa
very
good
beer
definitely
the
best
offer
in
the
2011
summer
sampler
do
nice
crisp
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
summer
it
really
has
some
good
balance
and
fits
the
style
very
well
overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
however
sa
seems
to
have
done
a
good
job
of
spicing
it
up
almost
too
light
for
my
tastes
though
d
session
beer
from
heaven
brilliant
balance
and
nuanced
flavor
with
a
moderate
alcohol
level
and
light
body
between
this
and
the
noble
pils
sam
adams
is
cornering
the
market
and
fantastic
light
session
beers
o
not
a
big
fan
for
the
kolsh
styles
due
their
lack
of
complexity
but
this
one
is
very
drinkable
thumbs
up
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
notched
at
sep
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
aroma
is
floral
and
grassy
some
bread
and
grains
as
well
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
floral
and
grainy
slightly
bitter
with
an
earthy
aftertaste
this
is
a
pretty
good
pick
for
warm
weather
drinking
crisp
and
smooth
refreshing
brew
overall
i
like
it
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
on
its
own
i
do
like
it
in
the
summer
mix
packthough
overall
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
kolsch
the
bbc
did
a
good
job
at
replicating
the
style
and
best
of
all
its
great
to
taste
one
fresh
rather
than
getting
burned
by
a
stale
import
as
kolsch
is
relatively
low
abv
beer
with
low
bitterness
so
it
does
not
travel
well
a
great
easy
drinking
summer
time
brew
wish
it
were
available
in
sixpacks
oh
and
most
importantly
cheers
to
my
200th
ba
review
delicious
kolsch
pours
a
very
pale
golden
color
with
generously
sized
creamy
white
head
nose
is
literally
like
some
jasmine
white
tea
ive
had
in
the
past
oh
so
delicate
yet
clearly
there
floral
elements
are
noted
quickly
on
the
palate
but
then
a
hearty
herbal
character
takes
center
stage
and
carries
through
to
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
delightfully
drinkable
more
floral
notes
in
the
aftertaste
too
really
really
like
this
kolsch
do
easily
drinkable
and
a
great
summer
beer
im
enjoying
these
new
additions
to
the
sam
packs
definitely
beats
the
blackberry
wheat
or
pale
ale
that
it
replaced
from
last
years
mixer
in
terms
of
a
summer
style
the
other
ratings
dont
do
this
beer
justice
its
a
style
that
i
feel
is
highly
accessible
and
worth
trying
poured
clear
amber
into
a
pint
glass
quick
white
14
inch
foam
doesnt
last
the
scent
is
very
subtle
i
get
flowers
maybe
a
little
malt
but
not
much
clean
crisp
light
taste
its
hard
to
pin
down
anything
specific
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
memorable
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
september
2011
snipped
off
the
label
sampled
on
april
8
2011
wow
i
cannot
believe
that
i
am
only
the
fourth
person
reviewing
a
new
sam
adams
brew
the
pour
into
my
kolsch
glass
is
a
wellcarbonated
pale
yellow
with
a
a
thin
white
head
the
aromas
are
grainy
and
malty
the
body
is
pretty
nice
in
the
medium
range
the
taste
has
a
decent
enough
grainy
character
with
a
slightly
assertive
dry
hoppy
ending
it
seems
to
emulate
the
style
well
enough
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
this
years
summer
mixed
12pack
pours
a
crystalclear
pale
yellow
body
with
nearly
an
inch
of
white
head
hints
of
fruit
and
nut
waft
from
the
beer
flavor
is
fruity
spicy
and
floral
balanced
and
tasty
but
not
inyourface
just
as
the
style
calls
for
an
awesome
addition
to
samuel
adams
summer
offerings
the
label
mentions
alsation
hops
imparts
subtle
citrus
note
jasmine
sambac
a
night
blooming
southeast
asian
flower
adds
a
delicate
floral
aroma
and
flavor
to
this
layered
and
refreshing
brew
the
hops
are
subtle
for
sure
and
the
floral
aroma
may
be
the
one
subtle
flavor
i
find
lingering
which
i
dont
really
care
for
the
ale
has
extreme
session
beer
written
all
over
it
thanks
sam
adams
for
continuing
to
define
what
an
extreme
beer
can
be
and
that
it
can
be
subtle
being
this
beer
is
aimed
for
summer
time
consumption
i
highly
recommend
it
nice
straw
color
with
hints
of
light
amber
thin
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
patterns
aroma
of
dried
grass
and
apples
with
a
touch
of
bannana
and
plum
possibly
vanilla
more
apple
and
grass
with
the
taste
and
something
along
the
lines
of
tomato
and
herbs
fairly
heavy
body
with
medium
carbonation
that
fades
quickly
this
is
the
first
kolsch
ive
had
in
awhile
and
it
makes
me
want
to
go
after
a
few
more
an
extremely
transluscent
pale
straw
color
brew
serves
prelude
to
the
light
and
crisp
flavors
of
tart
granny
smith
apple
sunroasted
grass
spicy
hops
thyme
and
wild
herb
presence
honey
and
pear
sweetness
spicy
and
bitter
on
the
nose
with
citric
acidity
comes
together
nicely
wellattenuated
and
reminds
me
of
the
new
wave
of
hoppier
drier
ciders
chewier
than
ciders
with
a
notable
maltiness
lending
a
comforting
caramel
aspect
compliments
a
relatively
high
bitterness
brilliant
pale
yellow
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
short
fizzy
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
earthy
dry
grain
bready
and
lightly
toasted
malt
and
light
herbal
floral
hop
aromas
medium
bodied
with
an
oily
feel
on
the
tongue
surrounded
by
crisp
drying
carbonation
throughout
a
nice
balance
of
bready
malt
and
herbal
hop
flavors
throughout
finished
crisp
and
bone
dry
with
light
herbal
hop
aftertaste
a
superb
crisp
refreshing
summertime
ale
clean
taste
light
seasonal
summery
good
beer
for
the
upcoming
outdoor
season
flavor
is
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
some
sugars
this
moves
to
a
spicy
and
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
that
dries
out
my
palate
after
each
sip
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
would
probably
be
very
good
on
a
warm
summer
day
or
with
a
picnic
easily
sessionable
alas
i
only
have
one
the
taste
and
texture
of
this
beer
does
not
match
the
styles
requisite
characteristics
having
had
the
german
imports
countless
times
one
should
find
a
unique
crispness
mild
minerality
and
those
subtle
apple
andor
white
grape
esters
none
of
that
here
that
said
this
is
still
a
mighty
fine
drink
shrug
a
good
well
made
beer
perfect
for
summer
activities
overall
its
very
solid
yet
leave
some
more
to
be
desired
o
have
not
had
many
of
this
style
but
this
beer
is
not
bad
has
similarities
to
a
pilsner
but
lots
of
ale
qualities
a
great
version
of
a
hard
to
brew
style
this
one
had
a
beautiful
pale
golden
straw
color
and
gorgeous
thick
bright
white
head
nice
flowery
hop
aroma
crisp
light
body
though
a
bit
heavier
than
most
kölsch
beers
ive
had
slightly
grainy
note
but
finishes
clean
with
good
hop
bitterness
a
little
more
bitter
than
most
other
versions
ive
had
great
light
warm
weather
beer
overall
refreshing
and
very
easy
drinking
it
is
a
rather
flavorful
beer
for
the
more
lightsummer
like
genera
o
flavorful
balanced
extremely
drinkable
i
like
the
simplicity
a
great
beer
to
sit
back
with
on
a
warm
spring
day
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
an
exceedingly
good
choice
of
a
beer
for
the
warmer
weather
this
would
also
be
a
great
crossover
beer
for
someone
who
needs
be
weaned
off
of
that
total
crap
called
lager
from
those
big
breweries
4
out
of
5
sparse
and
small
bubbles
drift
lazily
up
a
super
clear
pale
gold
ale
thin
lace
follows
a
small
and
pearly
white
head
lemon
hay
and
yeast
are
prominent
in
the
nose
and
as
an
extra
sessionable
brew
the
make
a
grassy
bitter
impression
on
the
tongue
but
its
not
overpowering
this
beer
is
extra
refreshing
and
disappeared
from
my
glass
before
i
knew
it
perfect
beer
with
my
sushi
and
probably
and
excellent
choice
to
pair
with
indian
thai
etc
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
the
taste
may
in
fact
deserve
higher
than
3
5
the
initial
taste
is
very
bready
and
malty
but
as
the
drink
progresses
it
becomes
more
kolschlike
with
some
lemony
grassy
notes
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
sit
down
with
and
really
work
my
way
through
i
wouldnt
mind
having
some
of
these
on
hand
for
those
highvolume
nights
overall
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
fresh
while
i
still
dont
believe
it
would
really
stand
out
it
could
be
an
enjoyable
refreshing
summer
beer

with

lingering

medium
carbonation

for

overall
this
is
a
very
nice
kolsch
style
nice
amount
of
flavor
with
good
balance
and
complexity
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
really
enjoyable
stuff
nice
production
not
too
loud
on
the
nose
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
consistent
and
earthy
gets
inky
on
the
end
i
love
how
were
able
to
see
these
styles
done
so
well
nowadays
out
of
the
us
its
hard
enough
to
get
good
ones
out
of
germany
as
it
is
and
i
mean
that
in
that
we
dont
get
much
variety
distributed
through
the
u
s
even
though
i
only
had
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
could
have
had
more
since
this
was
easygoing
and
pretty
light
on
the
alcoholic
aspects
because
this
style
isnt
that
common
this
would
suffice
for
anyone
looking
to
enjoy
a
beer
of
this
style
better
examples
are
out
there
but
since
theyre
not
easy
to
find
this
should
please
most
people
overall
a
very
satisfying
and
refreshing
example
of
the
style
i
really
wish
this
were
available
in
my
area
the
pour
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
sweet
but
crisp
good
pale
malt
aroma
light
hoppiness
mostly
floral
and
quite
clean
the
flavor
is
nicely
refreshing
good
clean
malt
and
hop
flavors
with
minimal
bitterness
a
mild
sweetness
of
bread
and
a
crisp
finish
o
a
nice
summer
refresher
with
enough
flavors
to
be
interesting
overall
an
above
average
kölsch
that
is
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
but
well
worth
a
try
overall
its
a
good
kolsch
but
i
can
find
more
crisp
and
balanced
versions
of
the
style
a
perfectly
brewed
kolsch
one
of
the
very
best
ive
had
an
exceptional
beer
i
will
be
going
back
to
the
store
and
getting
a
few
6ers
of
this
for
sure
highly
recommended
great
summer
beer
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
the
foodery
in
philadelphia
d
not
bad
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
while
it
wont
win
any
points
for
complexity
it
is
very
refreshing
overall
a
very
nice
kolsch
flavorful
no
off
putting
notes
and
nice
body
to
this
one
oda
great
beer
from
a
style
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
i
really
enjoyed
this
an
awesome
warmweather
beer
light
but
boasts
plenty
of
flavor
cool
cool
cool
overall
a
refreshing
example
of
the
style
not
unexpected
from
this
brewery
with
a
knack
for
the
germanic
strong
aroma
is
malty
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
it
pours
a
clear
wan
yellow
with
a
fluffy
and
not
persistent
white
head
ok
what
can
i
say
i
prefer
darker
beers
fortunately
appearance
is
this
beers
weakest
point
as
the
malty
flavor
has
firm
yeasty
and
fruity
notes
not
complex
but
refreshing
texture
has
good
body
and
a
fair
amount
of
fizz
overall
nothing
to
tweet
about
but
still
ok
rjt
overall
good
beer
could
easily
have
a
lot
of
these
in
the
summer
theres
things
id
like
to
be
done
a
bit
differently
more
hops
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
less
yeast
presence
in
flavor
but
its
still
a
well
done
beer
and
a
good
value
this
beer
pours
a
bold
clear
gold
with
no
head
or
lace
its
aroma
is
of
lemons
bread
and
honey
the
flavor
has
notes
of
lemon
honey
and
cake
with
a
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
mellows
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
stoudts
karnival
kolsch
is
a
good
beer
recommended
great
mouthfeel
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
i
do
love
the
prickly
ones
not
a
must
have
in
my
book
but
certainly
a
delicious
and
refreshing
session
beer
color
was
a
beautiful
pale
lemonyellow
and
if
that
makes
me
a
sissy
in
greg
kochs
eyes
so
be
it
mouthfeel
was
full
almost
creamy
and
the
soft
grassy
hops
were
delicious
in
the
mouth
the
finish
was
semidry
and
very
refreshing
this
would
be
a
most
welcome
summer
beer
especially
after
doing
lawn
work
plus
the
sticky
lacing
was
beautiful
beer
is
wet
and
nice
it
is
clean
and
sweet
up
front
nice
crispness
to
the
palate
and
the
finish
is
great
id
have
this
again
overall
there
is
not
much
going
on
here
but
i
guess
this
is
the
kolsch
style
this
is
similar
to
other
kolsch
style
beers
i
have
had
it
is
not
all
bad
the
the
addition
of
some
fruit
more
spice
and
hops
would
soup
this
up
nicely
i
had
this
on
draft
at
paradise
by
the
slice
it
had
a
nice
clear
golden
color
body
with
a
nice
2foamy
head
that
hung
around
a
while
the
smell
was
of
lemony
grassy
hops
the
taste
was
nice
and
crisp
sweet
grain
and
some
bitter
hops
to
finish
it
off
the
mouth
feel
was
great
nice
and
smooth
and
very
tasty
good
one
to
drink
when
it
is
warm
out
o
almost
like
their
gold
lager
made
with
ale
yeast
a
very
refreshing
springsummer
beer
and
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
macro
drinkers
o
dryness
bitterness
and
maltiness
seem
to
stand
out
in
this
beer
which
is
quite
easy
to
drink
given
its
low
alcohol
content
karnival
kolsch
pours
pale
yellow
and
holds
a
modest
creamy
head
of
foam
it
has
a
crisp
clean
aroma
of
grainy
lemony
grassiness
a
subtle
malt
sweetness
comes
through
behind
subdued
lemony
hoppy
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
great
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
little
crisp
bite
from
the
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
like
this
one
a
lot
and
is
a
nice
light
craft
beer
for
the
warmer
weather
good
worth
having
overall
pretty
darn
good
for
another
american
producing
kolsch
nose
and
appearances
aside
keepum
coming
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
underappreciated
style
overall
this
nothing
special
but
again
there
is
nothing
wrong
here
dry
and
assertive
all
the
while
adding
some
bready
notes
and
fairly
subtle
lemon
characters
full
carbonation
made
the
mouth
feel
incredibly
clean
and
well
refreshed
light
delicious
and
beautiful
it
is
a
good
summer
brew
this
is
my
first
kolsch
in
a
couple
years
and
it
is
nice
to
get
back
to
this
more
pilsner
than
kolsch
because
of
the
excessive
hoppiness
definitely
an
american
interpretation
that
said
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
still
had
that
recognizable
kolsch
fruitiness
overall
this
one
is
not
bad
nice
summer
brew
nothing
fancy
but
sometimes
that
is
aok
id
buy
it
again
o
dont
really
care
for
kolschs
but
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
could
stand
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
the
right
situation
o
this
is
my
go
to
american
kolsch
and
always
makes
me
feel
like
the
season
is
changing
cheers
great
drinking
experience
tbh
it
doesnt
seem
too
different
from
a
lager
sort
of
like
a
dry
pilsener
but
more
subdued
and
less
grassy
it
seems
like
balance
and
restraint
are
real
hallmarks
of
this
beer
and
i
applaud
stoudts
for
making
a
fine
version
of
a
lesser
known
and
hard
to
imitate
style
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
large
white
fizzy
head
that
had
good
retention
and
produced
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
straw
malts
a
nice
grassy
hop
and
a
soapy
scented
yeast
with
hints
of
citrus
and
maybe
honey
it
tasted
rather
bitter
and
mildly
acidic
with
a
nice
citrus
note
at
first
with
the
flavor
becoming
just
a
bit
sour
with
a
nice
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
was
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
nice
soft
carbonation
overall
it
was
nice
and
flavorful
although
nothing
too
special
o
overall
a
decent
flavor
with
an
added
measure
of
hops
making
for
a
light
drinking
affair
maybe
not
as
clean
malt
wise
or
as
crisp
as
its
german
counterparts
but
again
this
a
tough
act
to
measure
up
to
i
consumed
this
at
99f
and
found
it
refreshing
drinking
almost
like
a
pale
ale
at
times
o
d
a
fine
summer
beer
for
sure
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
really
nice
clarity
yellow
body
and
a
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
most
has
a
nose
of
some
malt
and
grains
not
really
much
hop
aroma
at
all
here
the
taste
is
light
all
around
the
flavor
that
it
does
have
is
pretty
refreshing
though
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
not
a
bad
kolsch
very
drinkable
good
hot
weather
beer
that
wants
you
to
follow
with
another
overall
i
enjoyed
this
greatlky
and
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
american
crafted
tribute
to
the
kölsch
style
will
definitely
recommend
d
very
drinkable
there
is
enough
flavor
and
complexity
to
keep
the
beer
interesting
without
every
feeling
watery
or
empty
the
beer
is
super
crisp
and
smooth
and
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
the
light
hop
addition
is
really
nice
o
very
decent
beer
but
a
far
stretch
to
call
it
a
kolsch
a
nice
tasty
hot
day
beer
better
than
a
lot
of
other
summer
kolschs
out
there
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
everything
a
good
pilsner
has
to
offer
pilsner
malts
and
czech
hops
except
this
beer
has
some
mild
kolsch
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
much
the
same
its
a
little
more
bitter
than
most
kolschs
ive
had
in
the
past
it
seems
like
its
modeled
after
a
traditional
czech
pilsner
but
substituting
the
yeast
strains
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
it
would
be
a
hit
with
both
ale
and
lager
drinkers
alike
overall
overall
a
decent
offering
and
you
have
to
applaud
stoudts
for
producing
a
style
that
is
relatively
rare
among
american
craft
brewers
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
macrolike
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
foamy
one
finger
head
that
settles
into
a
collar
of
medium
thickness
carbonation
is
very
active
theres
a
ton
of
bubbles
rising
aroma
is
slightly
citrusy
theres
a
hint
of
lemon
going
on
1st
sip
is
light
crisp
and
tart
with
more
of
the
lemon
peel
thing
going
on
there
is
a
bitterness
on
the
background
which
comes
more
from
the
lemon
than
any
hops
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
lagerlike
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
that
rocks
my
world
would
go
nice
with
something
off
the
grill
on
a
hot
summer
weekend
afternoon
but
not
something
id
put
on
my
must
have
list
poured
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
aroma
of
light
malts
and
hay
similar
taste
with
lightly
toasted
malts
hay
grass
earth
just
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
very
light
profile
crisp
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
for
a
summer
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
okay
o
im
enjoying
this
beer
and
it
could
be
a
good
one
for
the
summer
months
when
you
want
something
refreshing
this
beer
has
a
smooth
and
refreshing
taste
with
a
very
faint
bitter
bite
highly
drinkable
i
had
it
outside
on
a
patio
with
bratwurst
it
was
wonderful
in
the
spring
sun
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
again
in
the
hot
summer
months
anyone
whos
brewed
with
a
kolsch
yeast
has
undoubtedly
noted
the
terrible
smell
given
off
during
primary
fermentation
only
with
aging
at
nearlagering
temps
and
perhaps
a
finning
agent
or
two
can
you
get
rid
of
that
and
let
the
more
delicate
notes
shine
my
impression
of
karnival
kolsch
was
that
it
was
rushed
through
production
and
filtered
for
clarity
very
clear
sparkling
straw
to
pale
gold
body
capped
by
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
racing
to
the
surface
moderate
lacing
pleasant
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
fresh
bread
very
tasty
sweet
crisp
and
smooth
did
not
detect
much
of
a
hops
presence
mouthfeel
is
light
oily
and
soft
certainly
an
upgrade
over
the
everyday
american
lager
i
really
like
this
beer
d
this
is
the
perfect
lager
to
throw
down
on
a
warm
summer
day
concert
tailgate
anyone
d
refreshingly
light
some
subtle
hop
and
fruit
flavors
overall
a
tasty
nice
summer
beer
pours
a
clean
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
faint
small
malt
and
a
hint
of
tart
earthiness
in
the
taste
small
faint
tartness
earthy
and
a
dry
malt
a
small
bite
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
to
clean
aftertaste
nice
earthy
presence
clean
and
light
o
highly
drinkable
for
sure
i
could
see
myself
popping
a
few
of
these
around
the
pool
in
the
summertime
hey
thats
what
this
was
created
for
right
d
rather
drinkable
but
could
use
a
tiny
bit
more
carbonation
a
pretty
solid
beer
over
all
it
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
light
as
the
style
should
be
the
smell
is
good
again
a
bit
lighter
than
my
preference
but
its
a
well
made
beer
and
one
you
could
drink
again
and
again
this
kolsch
was
just
what
i
was
looking
for
from
the
style
a
really
easy
drinker
that
manages
a
good
deal
of
complexity
and
enough
hops
to
satisfy
a
hophead
i
think
im
a
fan
nothing
amazing
but
surely
a
beer
i
need
to
work
into
my
rotation
somehow
in
the
future
cleans
up
and
delivers
a
good
amount
of
flavor
without
being
overbearing
truly
easy
to
drink
like
it
should
be
i
want
to
say
kolsch
but
it
seems
too
simple
to
be
that
the
stange
and
then
it
to
be
kolsch
screams
too
easy
to
guess
ahh
hell
i
dont
know
for
sure
pilsner
nah
in
general
its
on
the
midupper
range
of
the
style
but
if
theyd
gone
any
lighter
id
imagine
todays
consumers
would
grumble
thinking
it
too
light
dont
let
them
know
it
has
less
alcohol
than
bud
a
touch
more
carbonation
might
help
to
give
it
a
little
more
refreshing
crispness
but
its
still
quite
good
as
it
is
overall
theyve
done
a
very
good
job
with
a
very
specifically
defined
style
keeping
it
from
becoming
a
blonde
ale
or
a
fruity
euro
lager
best
of
all
its
probably
fresh
prost
the
aroma
was
rather
light
touches
of
caramel
malts
light
bready
tones
and
a
hint
of
banana
were
all
that
were
readily
noticeable
not
bad
really
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
of
a
pop
in
it
though
if
i
am
being
honest
the
flavor
was
very
nice
though
rich
notes
of
biscuit
and
bready
malts
layered
on
top
of
a
light
fruity
spike
of
flavor
some
nice
touches
of
grain
coming
through
mid
palate
before
dropping
back
into
a
smooth
and
subtle
feel
crisp
and
clean
finish
left
only
the
lightest
bit
of
caramel
flavor
on
the
tongue
before
fading
into
the
back
and
leaving
me
ready
for
the
next
sip
nice
smooth
easy
carbonation
was
an
ease
to
drink
and
i
would
have
no
issue
with
putting
down
multiples
of
this
one
light
bodied
and
poundable
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
excellent
example
of
the
style
nice
head
when
poured
from
the
growler
nice
lacing
left
in
the
glass

bitter

a

im
a
big
fan
of
stoudts
so
to
me
this
is
another
example
of
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
this
was
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
the
heavier
stuff
ive
been
drinking
lately
a
solid

to

d
i
dont
know
why
i
keep
trying
kolsch
despite
disliking
it
as
a
style
in
general
not
a
lot
here
for
me
but
if
you
like
a
very
dry
light
malt
and
grainy
hop
style
of
german
brewing
this
stoudts
offering
isnt
a
bad
choice
one
and
done
for
me
though
bought
a
sixer
of
this

definitely
buy

this

neophytes
just
another
great
german
style
churned
out
by
the
brewers
at
stoudts
highly
recommended
prost
the
mouth
is
carbonated
well
but
this
beer
carries
a
smooth
quality
that
is
absent
in
most
of
this
style
i
kind
of
like
that
great
crisp
lemon
zest
at
the
front
some
creamy
butter
fresh
hop
bite
and
a
little
herbal
finish
very
nice
this
really
hit
the
spot
on
this
scorcher
of
an
afternoon
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
for
the
most
part
the
bitterness
is
there
but
not
too
strong
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
crisp
feel
is
a
bit
refreshing
they
had
this
on
draft
at
the
amsterdam
ale
house
in
manhattan
yesterday
when
it
was
sweltering
and
hot
what
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
day
refreshing
and
light
while
having
some
interesting
alelike
character
that
allows
you
enjoy
the
yeast
as
well
light
orange
color
and
very
cloudy
in
look
very
enjoyable
and
i
look
forward
to
having
one
today
and
tomorrow
and
d
insanely
quaffable
insanely
sessionable
loaded
with
character
and
personality
slightly
assertive
for
the
style
this
kolsch
really
delivers
and
doesnt
pull
any
punches
shouldnt
be
a
huge
surprise
coming
from
stoudts
but
this
is
a
truly
outstanding
beer
wonderful
balance
nicely
done
easy
to
drink
light
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
perfect
brew
to
drink
mass
quantities
of
great
job
guys
i
finally
found
this
again
best
by
july
2012
i
only
have
to
add
that
theres
a
faint
sulfur
note
on
the
nose
and
the
lemon
hop
character
on
the
nose
comes
into
the
palate
as
well
excellent
stuff
though
im
dropping
my
overall
from
5
id
given
it
a
5
for
drinkability
to
4
5
notes
this
is
a
style
that
is
growing
on
me
and
this
is
one
more
beer
that
reminds
me
how
good
this
styles
simple
yet
well
craft
drinkability
can
be
as
many
have
said
this
is
a
good
lawnmower
beer
its
light
and
refreshing
without
being
too
bland
and
flavorless
i
dont
mow
lawns
since
i
dont
have
a
yard
but
if
i
did
id
imagine
this
would
be
enjoyable
as
i
drunkenly
careened
around
the
yard
haphazardly
plowing
through
hedges
and
fences

angry
neighbors

this

the
better

domestic
offerings
out
there
this
was
very
good
for
the
style
and
while
it
maybe
lacked
some
of
the
vinous
and
yeasty
fruit
character
that
i
normally
like
in
the
nose
it
more
than
made
up
for
it
with

surprisingly
complex

and
super
easy

just
really
quaffable
and
tasty
stuff
here
just
in

for
the

i
certainly
was

and
turn

to
be
very
pleasantly
surprised
a
near
perfect
summer
session
beer
plenty
of

without
an
heavy
feel
makes
it
easy
to
drink
a
really
good
beer
to
have
in

well
done
stoudts
thanks
for
doing
such
a
nice
job
with
this
old
world
classic
such
a
perfect
session
beer
light
and
subtle
easy
to
drink
drinkability
this
is
a
definite
plus
for
drinkability
not
only
does
each
sip
follow
naturally
after
then
other
but
even
before
finishing
the
beer
im
thinking
about
opening
a
second
and
id
have
no
trouble
at
all
spending
an
entire
evening
with
multiple
bottles
of
this
beer
no
question
ill
be
having
this
one
again
a
12
ounce
bottle
picked
up
at
abes
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
about
an
inch
of
pillowy
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
are
of
white
grapes
green
apples
peach
lightly
toasted
bread
grassy
a
touch
of
lemon
light
to
medium
bodied
with
quite
lively
carbonation
finish
is
prickly
and
spicy
on
the
tongue
very
clean
and
drinkable
worth
a
shot
drinkability
this
is
a
clear
session
beer
for
me
for
the
style
this
one
hits
the
mark
light
and
refreshing
but
not
crisp
like
a
lager
stays
true
to
its
ale
roots
theres
light
sourness
that
is
similar
to
the
smell
the
aftertaste
is
tart
full
bodied
for
the
style
d
not
a
session
beer
purely
because
i
am
not
liking
the
combination
of
grass
and
funky
hops
aftertaste
ive
had
a
better
kolsch
beer
by
saranac
in
general
not
my
favorite
style
pilsners
also
in
that
mix
of
styles
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
but
both
the
kolsch
style
and
pilsner
style
are
normally
considered
highly
sessionable
brews
for
me
this
one
doesnt
fit
in
there
ontap
at
coles
light
colour
with
carbonation
bubbles
neutral
aroma
minimal
head
this
is
a
thirst
quencher
but
the
taste
was
rather
minimal
only
the
faintest
drop
of
lemon
or
hops
was
i
getting
unoffensive
but
fairly
plain
and
so
not
that
drinkable
d
karnival
has
a
good
taste
while
not
being
overly
huge
this
beer
is
refreshing
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
just
to
quench
my
thrist
easy
dranking
overall
this
was
a
very
well
done
example
of
the
style
all
the
elements
are
there
and
in
good
working
order
well
worth
a
shot
in
the
mouth
this
is
definitely
true
carbonation
makes
its
presence
felt
immediately
producing
a
soft
roll
on
the
tongue
some
lemon
tartness
emerges
and
zips
quickly
into
high
notes
of
bready
malt

not
as
dry
as
some
other
examples
ive
tried
unfortunately
but
imo
it
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
a
great
addition
to
the
local
beer
scene
this
spring
overall
the
beer
moves
soft
and
quickly
while
still
hitting
high
and
low
notes
telling
a
nice
refreshing
story
for
the
drinker
to
imbibe
a
thin

this
poured
a

with

it
smelled
like

floral
and
lemon
hops
with
some

it
tasted
like
floral
hops
with
sour
grassy
and
lemony
hops
and
some
bready
yeast
and
earthy
malt
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
that
seemed
like
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
was
too
sour
for
my
tastes
if
i
want
a
sour
beer
i
prefer
a
wild
ale
thats
more
bold
regardless
this
brew
was
a

dirty

for

very
nice
for
the

not
the
best
ive
had
but
its
nailed
the

i

this
to
anyone
and
as
for
myself
this
was
my
first
and
last
definetly
a
snoozer
exceptionally
drinkable
the
only
problem
is
that
my
local
store
wants
11
99
for
a
six
pact
when
the
lager
and
pils
are
9
99
still
you
should
definitely
try
this
one
d
this
is
a
lot
better
then
i
was
expecting
i
think
its
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
and
one
you
dont
see
too
often
at
that
i
found
myself
thoroughly
enjoying

they
maybe
should
have

this

for

but
if
we
keep
getting

all

i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
one
regularly
ontap
at
j
ryans
in
syracuse
appeared
a
brilliant
gold
color
with
a
tall
white
head
this
was
a
dry
and
hoppy
kolsch
as
in
there
was
less
malt
and
ester
than
most
germans
but
it
was
still
within
reason
for
the
style
and
it
was
quite
tasty
the
hops
were
earthy
and
spicy
like
good
euro
hops
while
there
was
a
light
bready
malt
undercurrant
no
its
not
the
best
or
most
complex
kolsch
summits
comes
to
mind
but
its
a
great

take
on
the

check
it
out
d
very

beer
out
on

deck
on

love
this
take
on

reminds
me
a

of
my
fav
lager
pretty
things
american
darling
just
slightly
less
hoppy
i
really
liked
this
one
and
it
would
be
delicious
on
a
hot
summers
day
enjoyable
easydrinker
its
tough
to
find
a
truly
fresh
german
kolsch
over
this
side
so
im
glad
to
see
american
brewers
succeeding
with
their
take
on
the
style
great
interpretation
of
a
classic
german
style
but
would
you
expect
anything
less
from
stoudts
crisp
well
balanced
and
enough
going
on
flavor
wise
to
keep
it
interesting
perfect
clarity
and
hue
for
the
style
with
a
modest
head
some
may
find
kolsch
beers
boring
but
i
find
them
to
be
excellent
daily
drinkers
for
those
warm
summer
days
and
stoudts
did
a
fine
job
on
theirs

on
in

ill
have

ill
definitely
mix

up
with
a
six

every
now
and
then
overlal
very
drinkable

and
another
good
one
from
stoudts

this

cheers
one
of
the
greatest
american
beers
ive
ever
had
this
beer
is
great
during
the
summer
o
a

tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of

its
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
options
within
the
style
090213
on

at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
not
as
light
as
i
know
kolschs
to
be
but
worth
a
try
o
decent
but
unexceptional
light
pale
ale
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
seems
like
it
could
use
a
lot
more
in
the
way
of
bitterness
and
dryness
to
be
representative
of
the
style
overall
not
bad
really
i
could
see
this
as
a
fastdrinking
beer
for
some
and
a
transition
beer
for
those
stuck
on
mainstream
beers
theres
some
good
stuff
in
there
but
not
a
lot
that
would
push
someone
new
to
the
game
away
they
market
it
as
a
good
summer
lagerale
and
it
does
cool
you
down
easily
because
of
the
easy
drinkability
good
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
slight
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
there
is
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
here
overall
an
easy
drinking
kolsch
beer
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
i
may
be
going
against
the
grain
with
this
review
but
to
me
this
is
what
a
refreshing
beer
should
taste
like
good
flavors
but
not
overpowering
the
old
man
and
i
threw
back
a
few
at
pyramids
tap
house
before
going
to
watch
tdkr
very
good
decision
o
a
fairly
decent
blonde
ale
but
it
languishes
on
the
shelves
this
is
their
summer
seasonal
and
cases
are
still
being
sent
to
stores
in
our
market
what
gives
the
freshness
date
is
not
decipherable
but
i
know
this
stuff
is
pretty
old
it
shows
in
the
appearance
smell
and
taste
and
whos
going
to
buy
a
middling
blonde
ale
at
an
11
six
pack
price
pyramid
needs
to
take
a
look
at
how
their
accounts
are
being
handled
out
here
and
consider
pulling
out
of
this
market
o
overall
a
curveball
if
you
consider
this
wide
left
of
its
intended
style
another
boring
beer
from
pyramid
that
you
can
easily
see
coming
like
a
softpitch
lob
rather
curve
very
generic
bland
and
becomes
insignificant
half
way
through
pass
pyramid
curve
ball
blonde
ale
is
a
very
sparkling
golden
ale
with
no
head
and
a
turbulent
surface
it
has
a
bright
lemony
aroma
with
light
grain
maybe
wheat
its
light
bodied
and
crisp
it
leaves
my
mouth
feeling
like
i
just
ate
an
apple
its
lightly
flavored
with
a
grassy
bitterness
at
the
finish
there
seems
to
be
a
very
light
sweetness
throughout
there
are
hints
of
lemon
apple
and
pear
this
was
a
good
choice
after
mowing
the
lawn
o
not
bad
sessionable
and
refreshing
not
all
that
complex
but
i
dont
think
it
is
trying
to
be
o
too
bad
not
a
good
beer
final
thoughts
the
term
blonde
ale
is
usually
not
met
with
much
excitement
the
same
is
true
with
pyramids
curve
ball
it
would
probably
taste
the
best
on
a
beach
somewhere
with
the
sun
beating
down
on
the
drinker
it
is
an
average
beer
nothing
bad
about
it
but
also
nothing
incredibly
good
nice
beer
that
goes
down
easy
goes
best
with
a
warm
summer
day
or
bbq
overall
a
fine
lawnmower
beer
but
i
see
no
reason
to
drink
this
again
if
theres
something
else
on
the
beer
list
i
havent
tried
d
very
drinkable
crisp
and
refreshing
the
balance
is
a
touch
off
and
it
is
a
bit
thin
but
overall
pretty
good
o
not
an
awesome
beer
seems
more
like
kolsch
lite
than
anything
else
still
it
is
a
step
above
the
bmc
crew
and
is
light
and
refreshing
for
the
summer
pyramid
apricot
was
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
got
into
so
ill
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
em
wanted
to
give
it
a
little
bump
in
the
score
for
having
a
baseball
related
name
but
overall
the
beer
isnt
anything
id
pay
much
more
than
1
per
12oz
at
a
store
the
score
given
is
based
on
the
style
for
an
american
kolsch
it
aint
bad
overall
better
than
i
had
anticipated
would
really
like
this
on
a
warm
summer
day
just
not
sure
if
this
beer
would
like
being
in
the
heat
drink
it
cold
pours
out
a
paler
semihazy
straw
color
than
most
other
kolsches
i
have
had
has
a
flash
head
that
disappears
in
a
minute
without
lacing
despite
a
somewhat
aggressive
pouring
smells
of
light
citrus
peel
pale
malt
and
a
small
amount
of
something
metallic
thankfully
the
metal
does
not
show
up
in
the
flavor
rather
i
get
a
nice
combination
of
herbal
spice
hopping
with
a
dash
of
lemon
peel
and
pale
malt
in
the
flavor
texture
and
carbonation
are
on
the
medium
scale
of
things
finish
is
only
semidry
but
lingers
for
a
good
long
while
o
picked
this
one
up
because
it
was
on
sale
being
that
it
was
priced
the
same
as
all
the
other
macro
brews
not
bad
would
easiy
pick
this
one
over
a
bud
light
o
better
than
i
expected
a
decent
balance
with
some
nice
citrus
flavors
give
it
a
shot
you
will
enjoy
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
looks
light
gold
with
a
clean
feel
maybe
a
inch
head
smells
just
like
a
kolsch
beer
and
a
little
bit
heavy
and
skunky
also
tasted
similar
to
a
kolsch
heavy
on
the
carbonation
with
a
weird
aftertaste
maybe
copper
tastes
fresh
and
clean
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
after
a
good
workout
kolsch
styles
are
hit
and
miss
for
me
and
id
say
this
might
actually
have
been
right
in
the
middle
probably
wouldnt
have
it
a
second
time
though
this
beer
was
somewhat
disappointing
to
me
very
bland
and
flavorless
throughout
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
belgian
style
blonde
but
lacked
most
of
those
characteristics
watery
and
lacking
in
most
all
flavor
catagories
its
been
a
few
years
since
ive
had
a
pyramid
beer
which
i
remember
being
good
but
now
im
not
sure
i
want
to
sample
others
from
them
this
beer
is
ok
but
too
much
like
mass
market
beers
i
can
get
for
much
less
i
had
hoped
for
a
bit
more
o
this
beer
is
a
craft
beer
entry
level
stater
for
sure
a
nice
change
from
a
hoppy
ipa
or
a
stout
on
a
hot
day
watching
baseball
great
drink
this
was
just
did
not
taste
good
to
me
very
bland
and
much
too
malty
without
a
balance
behind
the
other
flavors
d
an
ok
drinkable
beer
but
not
particularly
memorable
o
its
a
big
commercial
brew
probably
very
profitable
for
them
but
not
all
that
great

sunny
in

with

it

away
pretty

smells
mostly
fruity
some

only
very
slight
tastes

clean
with

again
its

thins

goes

good
choice
on

this
one
will
work
as
a

but
compare
it
to
its

and
it
doesnt
come
close
at

not
just
label
this
as
an

hint
of
metallic
fling
light
cereal
malt
in
the
background
but
overall
it
is
very
herbal
tasting
not
exactly
a
dry
crisp
kolsch
for
a
blonde
ale
its
ok
though
the
flavour
wanes
quickly
and
its
mellow
to
start
off
with
having
had
the
crystal
wheat
ale
right
before
this
had
i
not
seen
the
different
bottles
i
would
have
assumed
that
i
was
drinking
the
same
beer
due
mostly
to
the
plain
simple
nature
of
both
beers
pass
this
by
for
almost
any
other
craft
unless
you
are
looking
for
something
to
pound
and
not
think
about
d
no
thanks
one
half
of
these
is
more
than
enough
i
dont
think
im
a
big
kölsch
fan
overall
a
decent
brew
certainly
drinkable
but
nothing
special
i
poured
the
brew
into
a
summer
ale
tasting
glass
nothing
exceptional
about
the
appearance
slight
lacing
and
golen
in
color
the
initial
smell
is
spicy
cinnamon
and
some
sweetness
and
citris
the
taste
in
refreshing
and
balanced
just
not
alot
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
the
finsh
is
decent
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
a
decent
beer
kölsch
beers
are
fine
if
it
is
sunny
youre
in
köln
otherwise
leave
them
alone
they
are
supposed
to
be
delicate
and
flavourless
this
one
fits
the
bill
perfectly
so
full
marks
for
effort
the
beer
is
well
made
but
it
isnt
the
beer
to
be
having
if
youre
on
a
mission
like
i
was
overall
not
the
best
pyramid
beer
i
have
had
by
any
means
i
understand
they
were
going
for
a
refreshing
summer
ale
but
this
really
lacks
taste
i
will
not
purchase
this
any
time
soon
as
i
will
be
much
more
inclined
to
buy
new
beers
to
try
and
other
more
pleasing
beers
i
have
had
before
new
packaging
relabels
this
old
pyramid
offering
a
face
lift
their
summer
seasonal
kolsch
is
labeled
as
a
blonde
ale
this
time
around
pours
a
brilliant
golden
body
with
a
slight
haze
cast
over
it
bright
white
nicely
carbonated
head
forms
a
dimpled
cloud
rising
well
above
the
edge
of
my
glass
chunky
scattered
lacing
forms
with
each
sip
and
as
the
head
slowly
dwindles
down
aroma
has
some
mild
citrus
components
with
some
cooked
veggies
and
pale
biscuit
malt
sweetness
a
touch
of
herbal
spicy
hops
and
mineral
water
are
there
as
well
lets
see
how
its
tasting
a
bit
of
harshness
is
present
with
mild
grainy
off
flavors
the
metallic
edge
seems
to
overshadow
the
rest
of
the
flavors
some
nice
sweetness
with
a
kiss
of
citrus
fruit
are
apparent
but
they
become
muddled
within
cooked
veggies
and
that
mineral
rusty
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
carbonation
seems
a
bit
unnatural
and
forced
where
the
metallic
edge
really
weighs
the
palate
down
after
just
a
few
sips
drinkability
overall
is
pretty
pour
i
will
reevaluate
next
year
but
so
far
the
fall
seasonal
beats
the
pants
of
this
one
seriously
though
decent
summer
time
beer
and
goes
down
easy
pours
a
clear
golden
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
yeast
pale
malt
sweet
malt
and
slight
grain
fits
the
style
of
an
american
blonde
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
hops
sweet
malt
and
slight
citrus
overall
a
decent
blonde
with
good
body
and
nice
aroma
its
a
very
good
american
made
kolsch
d
an
easy
one
to
drink
but
not
one
to
remember
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
makes
for
a
poor
kolsch
one
of
my
least
favorites
from
pyramid
d
i
do
not
like
this
beer
and
i
love
the
kolsch
and
blonde
styles
this
missed
the
mark
this
ones
generally
drinkable
and
not
a
bad
beer
as
a
kolsch
though
there
are
others
id
pick
first
md
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
crisp
and
nice
on
a
hot
day
nothing
too
overly
amazing
but
not
bad
d
easy
to
drink
especially
on
a
warm
day
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
would
pursue
a
different
kolsch
next
time
kolsch
are
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
takes
a
little
bit
to
get
used
to
but
this
is
beer
is
true
to
it
style
lightmedium
in
body
and
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
nice
easydrinking
summer
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
out
of
this
beer
as
it
only
cost
1
35
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
once
again
this
beer
would
be
a
good
pick
to
get
tipsy
off
of
but
dont
ever
eat
your
dinner
with
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
in
body
and
quite
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
id
consider
buying
again
though
i
think
that
ill
explore
some
more
of
the
style
first
finish
is
clean
and
ends
up
dry
in
the
end
compared
to
the
full
circle
this
one
isnt
nearly
as
drinkable
for
the
style
that
is
this
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
wild
wheat
malt
with
light
lemon
hops
it
tasted
like
fresh
wheat
grain
sweet
lemon
hops
and
a
hint
of
delicate
seasoning
perhaps
thyme
it
was
very
thin
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
nice
clean
beer
that
was
perfectly
light
for
summer
drinking
but
still
flavorful
enough
to
enjoy
and
not
too
yeasty
will
definately
revisit
this
beer
each
summer
a
solid
seasonal
offering
from
pyramid
pours
a
apple
juice
amber
with
a
small
head
of
white
creamy
foam
that
leaves
no
lacing
as
it
vanishes
smells
of
lightly
toasted
malts
and
some
tart
apple
the
taste
is
a
bit
less
assuming
than
i
had
anticipatedoverall
very
balanced
roasted
peanutstoasted
white
breadalong
with
fruity
flavors
of
pear
and
red
apples
can
be
found
within
this
subtly
satisfying
brew
the
body
was
lightbut
not
as
light
as
other
kolsh
offeringsthe
carbonation
is
light
and
the
finish
is
clean
with
a
lingering
sweetness
this
went
nicely
with
the

me
to
order

6

afternoon
pyramid
makes
some
great

this
one
is
one
of
the
best
in

line
d
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
6pack
during
a
setting
and
being
very
happy
with
it
very
nice
attempt
at
a
kolsch
worth
a
go
d
on
a
hot
day
this
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
drink
other
than
that
ill
take
something
else
golden
light
honeylike
color
the
beer
pours
a
generous
light
and
quickly
dissipating
head
a
light
rim
remains
thoughout
drinking
the
beer
has
a
light
summery
nose
but
without
the
herbal
notes
mentioned
on
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
effervescent
as
i
would
like
with
a
kolsch
ale
the
taste
is
light
and
dry
with
the
ale
character
coming
through
to
distinguish
it
from
its
lighter
lager
counterparts
hints
of
citrus
and
bitter
greens
i
would
like
to
see
just
slightly
more
hop
character
for
balance
overall
a
very
drinkable
yet
not
overly
exciting
offering
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
a
light
brew
but
one
should
know
that
going
in
ahead
of
time
overall
an
acceptable
lil
kölschtype
brew
and
not
nearly
as
horrendous
as
everyones
making
it
out
to
be
an
orangish
brown
color
and
a
middling
tan
head
the
nose
has
pale
grainy
malts
and
some
mild
bittering
hops
the
taste
is
quite
light
with
an
herby
hop
presence
over
subtle
barley
a
light
body
has
ample
carbonation
not
a
bad
version
of
the
style
just
a
bit
on
the
light
side
d
if
the
flavor
was
a
little
better
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
although
it
would
be
much
better
than
a
light
lager
at
a
picnic
or
at
the
ballpark
this
is
easy
to
down
nothing
too
frightening
that
would
sprain
the
taste
buds
though
bummer
i
would
say
this
would
be
excellent
at
a
summer
party
where
not
everybody
was
ready
to
experience
an
over
the
top
ipa
or
a
heavy
ris
anybody
interested
in
experimenting
should
be
happy
with
this
anybody
wanting
a
little
more
should
also
enjoy
this
mk
it
pours
a
very
light
clear
yellow
color
thin
white
head
that
settles
very
quickly
smell
is
very
faint
fruit
very
little
if
any
hop
presence
im
not
sure
if
id
call
this
a
kolsch
but
it
is
a
good
brew
taste
has
a
very
light
malt
sweetness
smooth
and
light
mouthfeel
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
brew
i
much
prefer
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
before
a
game
but
its
still
good
in
bottles
d
if
its
being
poured
and
running
somewhere
ill
definitely
drink
this
for
the
night
if
i
wanted
an
interesting
blondeale
or
goldenlager
i
might
consider
buying
some
more
of
this
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
spicy
noble
hops
biscuity
malt
and
fresh
cut
grass
the
taste
is
full
of
spicy
hops
and
soft
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
kolsch
i
could
drink
this
again
drinking
this
beer
you
need
to
be
in
a
summer
frame
of
mind
this
is
patio
fodder
with
enough
hops
and
complexity
to
make
it
worth
drinking
clean
finish
with
apple
notes
on
the
nose
and
midbody
this
is
a
solid
version
of
the
style
this
wont
blow
your
socks
off
but
is
a
nice
change
from
all
the
wheat
beers
out
for
the
summer
poured
a
lightmedium
gold
with
little
short
lasting
white
head
smell
was
grassy
sweet
grain
metal
and
tea
like
at
times
too
on
the
light
side
of
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
for
a
lighter
beer
that
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
tastes
smooth
and
has
a
satisfying
creamy
sweetness
with
just
enough
bite
to
be
refreshing
not
as
good
the
2nd
time
i
tried
this
maybe
worth
a
shot
but
i
dont
think
ill
crave
it
a
3rd
time
could
probably
pound
way
too
many
of
these
this
beer
was
here
in
summer
and
i
chose
to
ignore
it
then
for
some
reason
tonite
i
just
had
to
give
her
a
go
its
a
good
thing
my
summer
didnt
know
what
she
missed
out
on
smell
is
hohum
kind
of
boring
there
is
some
herbiness
in
there
but
it
does
smell
as
many
have
pointed
out
like
a
wheat
beer
taste
is
mostly
malt
some
herbal
hoppiness
bitterness
balances
out
perfectly
mouthfeel
is
light
drinkability
is
good
i
bet
this
would
have
been
better
had
i
had
it
during
the
summerhotter
temperatures
and
lighter
bodied
beer
go
hand
in
hand
plus
it
would
have
been
fresher
certainly
not
a
home
run
but
not
a
strike
out
either
on
draught
at
chilis
in
the
houston
airport
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellowgold
color
with
columns
of
bubbles
and
a
medium
white
head
that
dissipates
steadily
spotty
lacing
aroma
of
mild
hops
and
citrus
lightbodied
and
effervescent
with
notes
of
hops
sweet
malt
and
citrus
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
hops
with
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
aftertaste
overall
about
what
you
would
expect
from
a
summertime
beer
from
a
brewer
like
pyramid
certainly
worth
it
had
this
at
my
hotel
in
durham
nc
and
it
seemed
pretty
fresh
the
appearance
was
a
bit
whimpy
with
a
very
light
golden
color
a
whispy
head
and
medium
lacing
the
aroma
was
skunky
wheat
to
me
not
my
favorite
although
i
am
also
generally
not
drawn
to
this
style
naturally
despite
a
number
of
pleasant
surprises
this
one
did
have
a
very
nice
clean
cereal
flavor
with
some
citrus
highlights
it
has
a
lively
carbonation
fine
bubbles
and
is
a
refreshing
drinkable
choice
but
its
maybe
a
little
too
dry
for
me
to
want
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
not
bad
but
worth
a
try
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
with
salsa
and
chips
perhaps
d
a
good
fullflavoured
kolsch
easy
to
drink
on
a
summers
day
or
watching
a
ball
game
as
it
suggests
on
the
label
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
at
a
good
price
one
of
the
cheaper
craft
brews
that
i
have
found
good
job
pyramid
its
not
one
that
id
go
out
of
the
way
for
but
my
wife
liked
it
worth
a
try
if
you
like
spiced
beers
also
i
thought
it
was
similar
to
american
wheats
so
if
you
like
those
try
this
maybe
with
a
lemon
light
to
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
leaves
a
bit
of
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
it
dries
out
nicely
easy
to
session
especially
on
a
warm
afternoon
its
sweetness
makes
me
think
of
a
gourmet
high
life
but
with
some
ale
characteristics
grapes
goes
down
easy
pretty
decent
american
kolsch
d
not
really
wanting
another
on
this
hot
summer
night
not
refreshing
enough
to
justify
the
lack
of
flavor
it
glows
yellow
when
poured
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
there
are
a
few
nice
flavors
in
this
beer
such
as
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
herb
with
some
grain
i
could
do
without
the
cooked
veggie
flavor
but
its
doesnt
destroy
the
overall
experiance
its
crisp
and
quaffable
two
of
the
styles
trademark
qualities
which
helps
beat
the
heat
crisp
clean
malt
notes
with
just
a
touch
of
tart
apple
and
a
grassy
finish
on
the
palate
unremarkable
yet
highly
quaffable
a
nice
summer
beer
to
keep
the
heat
at
bay
pours

little
fizzy
white
head
some

around
the
edges
the
nose
is
malty

some
spices
and
some
caramel
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
slightly
sweet
malty
and
hoppy
the
finish
is
slightly
drybitter
light
body
drinkable
not
too
bad
but
most
likely
will
not
buy
again
bottom
line
interesting
example
of
the
style
and
is
worth
a
try
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
there
was
a
small
head
and
it
dropped
away
quickly
milder
aroma
it
has
floral
and
citrus
notes
but
nothing
really
standing
out
some
sweetness
to
the
taste
with
a
slightly
citric
finish
i
wouldnt
call
it
bitter
but
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
not
bad
much
better
than
your
typical
lawnmower
beer
the
pyramid
curve
ball
kolsch
pours
a
clean
dark
straw
color
with
a
thin
head
which
quickly
dissipates
to
a
light
almost
transparent
layer
of
foam
leaves
no
lace
the
aroma
like
the
bottle
label
suggests
is
herbal
in
nature
peppery
too
with
perhaps
a
faint
hint
of
clove
deep
down
there
are
also
floral
components
within
and
some
faint
traces
of
citrus
a
nice
summertime
aroma
the
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
the
aroma
its
thin
almost
watery
with
weak
flavors
and
a
strong
alcoholflavored
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
which
is
how
a
kolsch
should
be
but
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
might
be
refreshing
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
but
there
are
better
choices
out
there
might
be
worth
trying
on
tap
somewhere
if
i
see
it
but
i
wont
exactly
seek
this
beer
out
again
there
are
better
kolsch
beers
to
be
found
for
sure
light
and
alright
pours
transparent
gold
with
light
carbonation
and
no
head
or
lace
of
any
kind
the
aroma
is
overloaded
with
ickysweet
buttery
honey
and
herb
tones
flavor
shows
somewhat
better
balance
the
initial
fruity
honey
notes
develop
into
a
slightly
crisp
herbal
banana
finish
body
is
only
thinly
carbonated
and
rather
too
syrupy
reasonably
drinkable
but
its
nearly
a
sweet
mead
rather
than
a
kolsch
notes
not
much
to
write
about
here
as
its
not
all
that
deep
or
complex
it
hits
all
the
marks
for
the
style
and
was
refreshing
and
clean
a
bit
more
carbonation
may
crispen
this
up
and
make
it
even
more
enjoyable
all
in
all
a
solid
offering
pours
an
ohsolight
slightly
hazy
golden
bodywith
a
quicly
receding
head
lace
is
pretty
decent
especially
on
the
far
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
quite
herbal
with
some
notes
of
wheat
and
banana
taste
initially
was
quite
displeasing
and
sour
but
as
the
beer
warms
up
and
i
warm
up
to
it
there
comes
a
pleasant
grassiness
and
wheaty
sweetness
tastes
like
a
summer
beer
to
me
body
is
pretty
thin
without
being
overly
carbonated
and
the
finish
is
nice
if
not
a
little
too
drying
on
the
cheeks
and
palate
refreshing
quafable
a
bit
sour
not
bad
bland
but
not
bad
i
bet
it
will
go
well
with
the
pizza
soon
to
be
delivered
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
with
very
light
spots
of
lace
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
spices
and
hops
the
taste
is
smooth
hops
spices
light
fruit
and
malts
this
almost
tastes
like
a
winter
holiday
brew
light
smooth
mouthfeel
the
fact
that
i
would
love
to
fill
a
stein
with
this
at
a
german
festival
is
enough
to
say
that
this
is
definitely
a
session
ale
none
of
the
other
kolsch
style
beers
ive
tried
have
even
come
close
to
this
highly
recommended
drinkability
a
nice
easy
dreinging
beer
good
for
working
out
in
the
yard
next
time
you
are
tempted
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
bud
light
t
odrink
during
your
home
improvement
project
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
this
up
instead
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
maybe
a
sessioner
but
nothing
too
exotic
my
first
kolsch
so
its
hard
to
judge
for
style
served
maybe
a
little
too
warm
too
felt
it
might
have
been
a
little
tastier
at
a
slightly
cooler
temp
went
pretty
well
with
a
light
turkey
sandwich
though
d
not
good
pass
a
mediocre
beer
more
funky
than
bad
when
it
comes
to
the
flavor
and
smell
some
may
like
this
but
its
definitely
not
my
thing
a
bit
watery
with
a
sharp
feel
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
some
orange
highlights
smells
grassy
with
hints
of
orangeslemons
taste
was
less
complex
than
i
had
anticipated
but
its
good
nonetheless
a
little
roasted
malt
action
coupled
with
a
strong
carbonation
and
grassy
aftertaste
its
a
nice
blend
very
drinkable
kolsch
when
drinking
this
i
keep
thinking
that
it
is
like
a
subdued
roggenbier
in
that
it
is
very
sour
rank
and
tart
and
a
bit
like
a
very
very
subdued
rauchbier
in
that
it
is
a
little
earthy
and
smokey
its
pretty
damn
complex
but
in
a
muted
way
this
one
whispers
instead
of
yelling
i
would
drink
this
again
in
the
summertime
very
sessionable
mine
went
down
in
less
than
ten
minutes
as
a
mildly
entertaining
thirst
quencher
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
drinkability
a
decent
summer
quaffer
but
just
doesnt
thrill
me
with
some
of
its
elements
pours
out
a
cloudy
dirty
golden
colour
with
a
thin
fine
head
and
wispy
rings
of
lace
on
my
glass
sweet
malty
aroma
a
bit
of
caramel
apples
some
vegetal
notes
and
a
bit
of
grainy
grassy
notes
lightly
malty
in
the
taste
mostly
herbal
and
grassy
with
metallic
overtures
dancing
on
my
tongue
quite
light
and
refreshing
without
any
sweetness
to
speak
of
body
is
light
even
a
touch
watery
at
times
mouthfeel
is
crisp
drinkability
is
above
average
just
for
being
the
decent
summer
quencher
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
this
kolsch
had
a
light
amber
slightly
orange
color
to
it
it
gave
a
very
light
head
which
did
not
hold
but
that
it
typical
for
kolsch
had
a
very
mild
smell
with
sublte
apple
coming
through
the
taste
was
crisp
and
smooth
again
with
some
mild
fruit
tones
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
went
down
smooth
all
in
all
seemed
light
a
decent
kolsch
12
oz
bottle
appearance
was
pale
gold
with
faint
orange
tone
slightly
hazy
no
head
despite
strong
pour
looked
flat
the
smell
was
primarily
apple
and
a
hint
of
wax
taste
was
slightly
sweetfruity
at
first
then
the
hops
came
through
and
it
finished
almost
peppery
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
flat
and
somewhat
drying
it
was
fairly
drinkable
but
it
seemed
to
have
more
bite
than
you
would
expect
from
the
style
maybe
some
of
their
other
stuff
is
better
but
ill
pass
on
this
boy
drinkability
this
is
too
citrusy
for
my
liking
interesting
nonetheless
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
is
nothing
special
about
it
its
light
and
bland
making
it
ok
for
a
hot
day
but
not
something
i
will
buy
again
overall
not
exactly
an
enjoyable
kolsch
and
one
you
should
avoid
overall
impression
highly
drinkable
summer
brew
this
is
a
nice
gateway
beer
but
it
is
also
interesting
enough
to
be
a
summer
staple
for
those
with
broader
tastes
pours
nice
pale
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
ok
head
smells
grassy
and
citric
and
a
touch
off
in
the
malt
the
offness
contiues
as
i
sip
through
this
i
think
it
might
be
slightly
oxidized
or
have
some
metal
in
the
water
i
dont
like
i
dont
know
i
dont
care
for
this
one
i
couldnt
finish
this
before
dinner
so
i
dumped
it
and
got
something
better
this
beer
is
ver
refreshing
great
for
a
hot
summers
day
there
is
one
thing
it
is
lacking
the
hint
of
sulfer
that
most
kolschs
have
low
to
medium
bodied
a
fairly
refreshing
beer
for
hot
weather
not
too
bad
for
a
summer
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
not
anything
complex
or
aggressive
i
do
not
know
if
this
does
justice
to
the
kolsch
style
but
i
find
this
beer
very
enjoyable
and
imagine
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
makes
sense
as
a
summer
seasonal
and
would
be
great
with
some
grilled
burgers
not
one
i
will
drink
again
just
not
a
good
kolsch
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
with
plenty
of
bubbles
pretty
thin
and
refreshing
but
a
bit
too
bubbly
a
bit
bland
it
really
doesnt
grab
my
attention
in
any
way
would
make
a
nice
lawn
mower
beer
though
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
like
today
but
not
much
character
to
distinguish
from
millions
of
other
beers
out
there
taste
is
very
crisp
with
a
sweetness
that
quickly
turns
to
a
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
i
would
rate
the
bitterness
as
being
medium
in
intensity
which
i
prefer
with
the
kolsch
style
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
light
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
frankly
the
flavor
is
underwhelming
i
would
prefer
something
a
little
more
fullbodied
i
wouldnt
mind
having
curve
ball
again
especially
on
a
hot
day
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
smells
fruityfaintly
reminds
me
of
the
fruity
aroma
of
belgian
ales
not
much
head
at
all
thin
and
bubbly
and
quickly
disappears
leaving
no
lacing
looks
light
and
blonde
but
with
a
murky
cloudiness
i
like
it
my
first
response
was
oh
this
is
a
happy
beer
because
of
that
fresh
germany
herb
taste
that
kicks
into
the
back
of
my
mouth
i
feel
like
its
lifting
my
spirits
already
fairly
straightforward
light
on
the
hops
but
laesst
sich
leicht
trinken
allows
itself
to
be
drank
easily
as
the
germans
would
say
this
would
be
fantastic
as
a
refresher
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
ill
try
it
again
when
its
not
24
degrees
outside
pours
a
medium
gold
with
a
1
finger
head
after
an
aggresive
pour
ok
longevity
and
ok
lace
grassy
sweet
malt
smells
mixed
with
honey
and
a
hint
of
citrus
sweet
malt
with
honey
and
slight
bitterness
definately
a
lawnmower
beer
very
unoffensive
highly
drinkable
due
to
its
lightness
not
a
great
beer
but
ok
despite
the
out
whack
flavors
still
pretty
quaffable
if
taken
out
of
context
of
the
style
i
did
like
last
years
effort
quite
a
bit
more
as
with
most
kolshes
if
you
are
thirsty
and
want
a
decent
beer
this
will
work
poured
from
a
bottle
had
a
best
by
date
of
101206
pale
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
that
quickly
dissipated
very
little
carbonation
had
a
good
smell
that
makes
you
think
of
summertime
session
beers
unfortunately
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
it
it
was
average
for
the
sytle
and
would
try
again
but
if
i
want
a
kolsch
session
beer
then
im
going
with
st
arnolds
lawnmower
a
classic
overall
impression
a
mild
lawnmower
beer
not
exactly
a
session
though
just
not
enough
flavor
going
on
for
me
enjoyable
but
mild
not
bad
for
a
summer
quaffer
if
you
find
it
somewhere
cheap
not
a
bad
beer
and
difinately
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
drinkability
refreshing
corn
not
overwhelming
not
too
bad
but
im
noticing
a
quality
control
problem
with
more
delicate
beers
from
pyramids
bottles
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
bit
of
a
chill
haze
and
a
short
white
head
that
vanishes
completely
without
a
trace
nose
is
somewhat
herbal
with
notes
of
pungent
hops
though
there
is
a
malt
sweetness
in
the
background
the
taste
is
bright
and
lively
up
front
with
a
good
deal
of
fruitiness
followed
by
a
bit
of
wheat
and
then
some
mild
citrusy
hops
towards
the
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
choice
to
enjoy
outdoors
on
a
hot
day
or
even
better
as
the
label
suggestsout
at
the
ballpark
soft
mouthfeel
nice
finish
clean
and
refreshing
good
carbonation
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
i
am
impressed
by
it
and
reccomend
it
on
a
hot
day
i
will
definitely
look
for
this
again
at
some
point
poured
a
clear
moderate
amber
color
with
sparse
head
smell
is
light
of
herbs
and
a
bit
sour
taste
is
unremarkable
with
maybe
a
bit
of
dryness
and
not
much
else
mouhtfeel
is
mildly
dry
a
very
disappointing
beer
and
i
probably
will
not
try
it
again
nice
drinkable
brew
but
not
really
a
session
beer
this
one
is
for
enjoying
with
food
my
first
kolsch
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
very
little
head
aroma
of
baked
bread
with
just
a
ever
so
faint
hint
of
lemon
very
smooth
and
light
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
not
a
bad
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
just
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
notes
this
is
what
happens
when
you
use
american
2row
instead
of
german
pilsener
malt
the
body
is
way
too
thick
its
not
quite
as
refreshing
crisp
and
thirst
quenching
as
a
real
cologne
kolsch
its
an
ok
try
though
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
retain
the
aroma
is
a
raw
barley
aroma
with
a
hint
of
earthy
mineraly
hops
taste
begins
with
a
bready
malt
flavor
and
a
mineraly
hops
flavor
different
but
not
really
good
per
se
as
ive
experienced
with
many
of
pyramids
beers
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
and
the
caronbation
is
moderate
to
high
drinkability
is
pretty
good
an
interesting
but
not
really
exciting
brew
almost
no
head
but
whats
there
is
white
and
fizzy
beer
is
slightly
hazy
gold
a
little
dirty
theres
a
touch
of
sour
milk
in
the
faint
sweet
nutty
aroma
the
beer
starts
nutty
and
fruity
quite
full
and
fruity
through
the
middle
grassy
bitter
in
the
end
with
big
nuts
in
the
aftertaste
good
tasty
bitter
fruity
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
this
very
nice
example
light
bodied
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
and
tiny
bubbles
of
easy
carbonation
nothing
to
write
home
about
good
suppin
beer
i
suppose
certainly
light
and
drinkable
completely
inoffensive
pale
golden
clear
with
not
much
head
on
it
lightly
fruity
lightly
floral
aroma
pleasant
and
subtle
flavor
is
simple
a
touch
of
malt
and
fairly
low
bitterness
and
a
clean
ever
so
slight
tartness
at
the
end
theres
a
slight
wheat
malt
taste
also
i
think
body
is
light
texture
neutral
an
uncomplex
but
moderately
tasty
beer
good
for
a
session
ale
the
color
is
clear
light
golden
shade
with
an
average
bright
white
head
almost
no
carbonation
aroma
is
fruity
with
a
good
bit
of
sweetness
and
just
a
little
citrus
smell
taste
has
a
good
combination
of
sweet
grains
and
fruitiness
herbal
hops
provide
some
balance
and
a
citrusy
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
somewhat
dry
very
thirst
quinching
and
very
easy
to
drink
curve
ball
does
everything
that
i
want
of
a
summer
seasonal
poured
out
to
a
slighly
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nicely
formed
head
and
a
touch
of
lace
around
the
glass
odors
of
bread
and
grain
were
slighly
noticed
otherwise
not
much
to
tell
the
taste
is
where
i
really
think
things
need
inmprovement
it
needs
more
its
not
bad
relatively
dry
with
hints
of
grassy
like
qualities
and
the
flavor
of
raw
oats
slightly
bitter
with
a
hint
of
sourness
finished
crispy
and
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
with
the
carbonation
striking
the
tastebuds
with
the
notion
of
something
interesting
on
the
way
unfortunately
it
never
comes
this
brew
just
needs
more
flavor
worth
a
try
but
i
must
imagine
there
are
better
kolsch
beers
out
there
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
day
really
easy
drinking
certainly
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
i
could
knock
back
4
and
not
realize
it
until
the
alcohol
kicked
in
average
marks
across
the
board
not
pyramids
best
but
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
if
youre
one
who
doesnt
like
the
beer
too
bitter
definately
give
this
one
a
try
slightly
hazy
gold
color
small
white

the
top
light

light
sweetness
is
capped
by
a
more
robust
grainy
taste
kiss
of
flowery
hops
in
the
rear
medium
soft
bodied
again
certainly
not
bad
but
there
are
others
i
would
turn
to
first
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
at
the
start
with
a
clean
dry
crisp
finish
drinkability
is
down
a
notch
with
since
the
flavors
and
look
of
the
brew
are
not
up
to
others
beer
is
good
happy
kölsch
beering
drinkability
more
impressed
than
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
if
i
were
to
buy
pyramid
i
would
take
a
stab
at
this
one
better
than
all
the
others
i
have
tasted
by
a
good
margin
all
except
the
snow
cap
which
is
a
whole
different
beer
give
it
a
try
slightly
hazed
golden
in
color
with
tons
of

rising
to
just
a
bit
of

and
a

and

aroma
that
is
just
nice

although
its
certainly
not
bad
by
any
means
its
a
light
summer
ale
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
traditional
kolsch
characteristics
although
the
word
has
become
shorthand
for
an
american
blonde
ale
often
available
in
the
summer
the
bottle
had
a
disturbing
amount
of
dark
sediment
although
the
bestby
date
was
100304
and
the
beer
poured
with
an
unfiltered
haze
which
was
pleasing
but
definitely
not
true
to
style
small
amount
of
spidery
lace
some
lemon
and
grass
flavors
are
actually
quite
pleasing
and
a
wheaty
tartness
seemed
to
be
evident
best
served
at
a
cooler
temperature
and
meant
to
be
drunk
quickly
although
not
in
big
gulps
perhaps
also
best
in
the
dead
heat
of
summer
ive
only
had
one
other
kölsch
and
that
one
was
on
tap
from
a
german
style
microbrewery
i
liked
it
fairly
well
but
wasnt
blown
away
thats
about
how
i
feel
with
the
curve
ball
pyramid
doesnt
make
too
many
bad
beers
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
especially
great
some
head
sat
on
the
orangebrown
beer
a
nice
flowery
smell
but
mellow
the
taste
was
smooth
and
malty
and
the
beer
went
down
well
the
main
problem
with
it
is
that
i
wasnt
satisfied
when
i
was
finished
despite
having
a
beer
with
something
to
it
very
much
a
summer
type
ale
light
bodied
lightmedium
carbonation
and
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
pours
a
twofingered
pure
white
head
that
settles
quickly
but
leaves
some
lace
starts
sweet
and
citrusy
finishes
quietly
with
only
a
hint
of

not

that

this
goes
down
rather
easy
no
its
not
complex
at
all
but
its
not
meant
to
be
like
the
name
implies
this
is
a
beer
meant
for
quaffing
during
the
hot
summer
months
this
would
be
great
during
a
baseball
game
on
a
long
summer
day
at
the
viking
they
have
this
ontap
and
they
sell
it
for
2
whenever
the
mariners
are
on
tv
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
beer
at
all
do
people
really
like
this
not
for
my
taste
at
all
an
o
k
offering
that
i
had
at
the
pyramid
alehouse
in
walnut
creek
straw
colored
and
topped
by
a
thin
white
head
that
did
not
last
too
long
lacing
was
not
around
at
all
grainy
aroma
was
quite
pronounced
malty
grainy
taste
profile
was
light
and
refreshing
some
herbal
hoppiness
and
a
touch
of
lemony
notes
were
present
easy
drinking
with
a
light
mouthfeel
a
decent
seasonal
but
not
outstanding
by
any
means
good
for
a
hot
day
but
there
are
better
to
be
had
this
offering
from
pyramid
hit
the
spot
on
a
nearly100ºf
day
at
the
baseball
game
refreshing
and
light
curveball
had
a
nice
taste
and
feel
that
lent
itself
to
easy
drinking
definitely
beats
the
macro
offerings
that
dominate
most
venues
overall
not
bad
and
it
does
what
i
wanted
it
to

goes
with
pizza
perfectly
but
it
also
a
great
drinking
beer
neigh
a
good
sixpack
to
have
in
the
fridge
for
the
summer
on
a
hot
afternoon
this
beer
poured
a
watery
brownish
yellow
color
with
a
head
that
faded
very
quickly
what
happened
to
the
head
here
and
where
is
the
lacing
lots
of
bubbles
though
rise
to
the
top
smell
is
of
toasted
grain
but
its
also
a
bit
buttery
and
skunky
not
too
nice
taste
starts
off
somewhat
sweet
maybe
apple
like
sweetness
strong
herbal
flavors
are
there
as
well
kind
of
grassy
middle
is
light
and
airy
almost
watery
but
not
quite
finish
is
dry
but
not
really
that
crisp
all
in
all
this
beer
didnt
do
it
for
me
good
in
really
hot
weather
but
that
about
it
the
medium
carbonation
and
mild
hopping
added
a
nice
finish
that
cleared
the
palate
after
each
sip
inviting
another
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
and
not
getting
tired
of
the
experience
it
was
a
nicely
balanced
ale
that
invites
another
round
i
havent
been
too
thrilled
with
pyramid
beer
in
the
past
but
curve
ball
kolsch
surprised
me
by
being
pretty
decent
maybe
they
should
have
called
it
change
up
kolsch
not
a
bad
beer
but
if
your
looking
for
an
even
better
interpretation
try
the
goose
island
summer
kolsch
is
often
an
underappreciated
style
since
a
welldone
beer
in
the
style
is
still
pretty
reserved
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
effort
crisp
clean
with
a
touch
of
citric
acidity
for
refreshment
slightly
herbal
hops
profile
a
little
cereal
grain
flavor
crept
in
but
not
so
much
as
to
throw
the
beer
off
this
is
the
beer
mass
produced
pale
lagers
want
to
be
when
they
are
reincarnated
as
their
next
step
to
beer
nirvana
if
this
were
more
available
to
me
it
would
be
my
goto
beer
for
the
patio
this
summer
thin
yellow
body
is
slightly
hazed
white
head
is
small
and
completely
vanishes
in
ten
seconds
without
lacing
aroma
has
dry
biscuity
malt
and
a
faint
herbal
hops
note
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
bodied
taste
is
very
light
bodied
with
some
grainy
malt
and
nice
but
faint
herbal
hops
bitterness
for
balance
not
very
complex
but
drinkability
is
good
i
would
call
this
one
of
those
lawnmower
beers
but
not
so
bland
that
it
isnt
worth
drinking
it
goes
down
rather
easily

use
a

that
is
just
my
opinion
im
far
from
complaining
however
because
its
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
fits
wonderfully
as
a
refreshing
summer
brew
final
note
zommerfest
is
best
if
drank
by
itself
and
not
with
food
not
a
good
combination
ive
found
overall
this
is
a
fairly
bland
beer
and
a
poor
example
of
a
kölschstyle
way
too
bready
and
malt
forward
where
are
the
fruity
yeasty
esters
wheres
the
clean
finish
another
meh
beer
from
schells
zommerfest
pours
a
golden
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
the
aroma
was
non
existent
and
not
present
the
taste
was
rather
light
and
not
very
noticeable
some
crisp
flavors
but
not
really
present
light
body
light
flavors
overall
its
not
a
badbeer
and
its
not
a
very
flavorful
beer
well
pleased
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
german
kolsch
style
nice
crisp
and
clean
light
lager
taste
that
is
a
good
summer
option
the
pour
is
light
gold
with
a
big
rocky
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
good
carbonation
very
clear
not
much
aroma
a
very
light
hoppy
malty
scent
not
unpleasant
the
taste
is
rich
but
not
overwhelming
its
nice
sweet
mixed
with
bitter
and
lightly
hoppy
hard
to
get
a
fix
on
it
but
not
unpleasant
light
to
moderate
on
the
tongue
with
a
little
buzz
from
the
carbonation
with
a
clean
finish
overall
its
pleasant
without
being
a
palate
wrecker
perfect
for
summer
evenings
on
the
porch
with
grilled
shrimp
and
a
caesar
salad
the
taste
isnt
so
strong
that
it
will
overpower
delicate
flavors
like
fish
and
shellfish
nor
will
the
alcohol
knock
you
on
your
tush
either
it
does
have
flavor
though
which
puts
it

and
shoulders
above

and
alcohol
show
up
when
they
shouldnt
one
of
those
beers
that
i
can
drink
but
that
i
dont
feel
any
need
or
real
desire
to
refreshing
enough
though
the
toastybuttery
character
and
the
mouthfeel
bring
it
down
a
notch
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
summer
which
i
could
drink
again
and
again
overall
this
is
a
quality
kolsch
and
a
nice
clean
drinkable
summer
ale
nothing
mindblowing
but
that
is
not
what
this
intends
just
a
good
clean
refreshing
brew
for
a
hot

day

well

a

basic
and
refreshing
kolsch
nothing
fancy
but
it
doesnt
really
need
to
be
part
three
of
my
sixpart
intro
to
the
brewery
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
lemon
zest
light
orange
zest
very
light
wheat
and
a
tiny
peckonthecheek
of
sweet
flowers
yeah
its
all
pretty
weak
but
it
works
here
the
taste
follows
pretty
closely
though
the
power
missing
from
the
aroma
has
shown
up
here
in
spades
the
emphasis
is
on
the
lemon
with
some
cardamom
tossed
in
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
fluid
feel
overall
this
was
a
surprisingly
enjoyable
kolsch
its
nothing
overtly
spectacular
but
more
than
tasty
enough
for
one
of
those
hot
summer
days
we
all
try
to
remember
in
these
cold
times
well
i
mean
i
kinda
enjoy
the
colder
months
but
you
get
where
im
coming
from
here
right
pretty
hard
to
pick
up
anything
at
all
of
of
this
right
out
of
the
gate
as
i
let
it
settle
i
started
to
pick
up
some
light
tones
of
grain
and
maybe
even
corn
off
the
top
but
again
very
light
and
hard
to
detect
a
slight
yeasty
presence
there
was
some
ight
hoppiness
to
it
and
maybe
a
touch
of
grape
or
fruit
of
some
kind
but
very
light
i
could
almost
see
this
as
a
replenish
drink
after
a
long
hot
day
it
just
came
off
as
that
light
in
body
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
meant
to
be
consumed
leisurely
throughout
the
day
which
is
what
i
find
myself
doing
now
omaybe
it
was
a
little
past
its
prime
but
it
would
be
a
good
everyday
drimk
that
you
dont
need
to
think
about
overall
flat
and
unimpressive
nothing
worth
rebuying
here
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
lighter
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
d
good
brew
from
schells
light
bodied
brew
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
and
malt
easy
drinker
that
you
could
have
more
of
a
good
grilling
brew
nice
for
the
warm
weather
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
decent
brew
nonetheless
d
a
very
drinkable
kolsch
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
would
have
liked
to
tone
the
carbonation
down
a
notch
and
maybe
slightly
more
citric
flavor
would
do
wonders
but
this
is
a
very
pleasant
summer
beer
notes
zommerfest
is
an
easily
drinkable
light
bodied
beer
that
would
be
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
it
lacks
a
bit
in
body
but
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
very
well
balanced
and
quite
refreshing
its
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
releases
from
the
folks
in
new
ulm
o
if
it
wasnt
for
some
light
fruit
esters
even
slightly
tart
in
the
main
flavor
body
of
the
beer
this
could
almost
be
a
helles
as
it
is
its
a
great
quencher
with
good
flavor
character
that
isnt
just
another
pale
beer
on
the
shelf
d
hmmmm
despite
the
negative
aspects
here
this
is
a
decent
summer
drinking
beer
i
love

but
this
is

from
their
best

willing
to
try
again

consider
it

a
lawnmower
classic
schells
zommerfest
was
golden
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
white
head
with
poor
retention
and
no
lace
the
smell
was
sweet
light
malt
and
slightly
floral
the
taste
was
light
malt
with
some
floral
and
earthy
hops
the
finish
was
dry
with
some
hop
flavor
and
touch
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
just
less
than
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
and
good
for
a
hot
day
d
well
it
was
ok
but
nothing
to
go
back
for
repeated
visits
what
was
weird
was
the
label
looked
like
something
out
of
bmc
standards
which
made
me
kind
of
weary
of
purchase
but
i
did
not
regret
it
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
next
summer
d
might
not
be
the
first
beer
id
grab
but
definitely
not
the
last
kind
of
a
slow
sipper
a
nice
summer
beer
that
is
easily
sessionable
pours
a
deep
gold
with
a
fairly
quickly
dissipating
head
that
leaves
about
an
inch
thick
layer
of
foam
aroma
is
a
bit
underwhelming
though
some
hops
is
there
to
be
found
taste
is
good
with
a
restrained
hops
presence
up
front
and
apricot
and
citrus
notes
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
nicely
crisp
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
which
would
be
best
enjoyed
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
nothing
special
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
but
i
guess
it
fits
as
a
summer
beer
taste
is
well
balanced
with
the
leafy
hops
contributing
a
nice
bitterness
malts
are
grainy
and
a
bit
sweet
almost
cornesque
mouthfeel
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
nice
and
creamy
with
a
fullish
body
i
drank
this
without
the
accompaniment
of
ba
and
am
surprised
to
find
this
is
listed
as

was

flavor
in
this
klosch
still
schells
put
out
some
nice
brews
ill
drink
it
again
d
everything
about
this
beer
sets
it
up
to
be
a
great
summer
thirst
quencher
lawn
mower
sitting
around
the
pool
beer
gives
the
feel
that
you
could
drink
these
all
day
had
a
bottle
from
princeton
liquors
marked
091010
i
believe
that
has
it
bottled
on
april
1
of
this
year
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
a
good
kolsch
theres
a
grain
beltlike
sweet
corn
taste
but
otherwise
there
are
mellow
fruity
malts
and
a
mild
earthy
hop
note
not
a
real
stand
out
but
well
worth
trying
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
clear
light
gold
body
and
thin
bright
white
head
aroma
of
clean
malts
honey
and
some
flowery
hops
light
bodied
and
crip
with
a
good
malt
sweetness
and
a
nice
touch
of
honey
clean
finish
with
a
small
hop
aftertaste
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
out
there
d
very
very
drinkable
light
but
with
a
decent
flavor
to
it
not
over
carbed
and
not
flat
thsi
was
the
last
of
the
6pack
sampler
from
schell
enjoyed
3
and
will
pass
on
the
last
3
next
time
d
a
good
summer
beer
but
not
to
much
distinctive
about
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
that
is
pretty
smooth
nothing
special
though
good
sessioner
and
a
great
lawnmower
dark
gold
color
with
little
to
no
head
and
a
little
bit
of
prickle
classic
nose
of
grain
that
i
would
associate
with
scores
of
mainstream
beers
refreshing
attack
of
grainy
flavors
that
sour
in
the
mouth
there
is
an
aftertaste
that
ends
up
being
like
an
overly
dry
hefeweizen
pretty
average
and
would
be
a
fine
beer
to
toss
in
the
cooler
if
you
are
inviting
a
bunch
of
random
folks
over
for
a
bbq
as
it
would
quench
the
thirst
of
macro
brew
drinkers
and
not
kill
the
craft
beer
guy
to
have
some
leftover
in
the
fridge
drinkability
very
drinkable
low
abv
refreshing
and
smooth
a
good
beer
for
those
that
like
pilsners
or
lighter
tasting
beers
ddrink
this
one
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
and
youll
be
hooked
actually
i
did
enjoy
another
bottle
of
this
beer
subsequent
to
this
rating
after
moving
a
couple
pieces
of
furniture
with
a
friend
this
brew
is
refreshing
dry
smooth
and
an
appropriate
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
great
lawnmower
beer
too
bad
i
am
at
work
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
i
could
enjoy
these
all
day
during
a
hot
day
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
light
but
still
has
some
flavor
to
it
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
its
certainly
a
sessionable
beer
at
4
7
abv
i
do
however
have
issues
calling
this
a
kolsch
im
not
impressed
by
the
flavor
profile
or
the
look
of
this
beer
light
to
medium
body
ample
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
very
drinkable
this
is
the
perfect
summer
brew
for
anyone
looking
to
expand
their
beer
horizons
i
would
venture
to
say
that
even
a
bmc
drinker
would
enjoy
this
its
simple
and
tasty
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
hot
day
d
easy
to
quaff
typical
of
american
style
kolsch
beers
still
amazes
me
the
difference
between
styles
that
we
share
with
our
german
brothers
seperate
the
same
but
different
and
good
the
taste
is
light
and
zesty
but
a
bit
dry
rough
alcoholic
at
first
but
unpleasantly
bitter
in
the
end
a
bit
sharp
flavours
include
white
wine
grain
honey
and
juice
with
a
light
grain
aftertaste
developing
but
its
too
thin
rough
and
sharp
in
the
finish
clear
golden
body
with
a
full
head
of
bright
white
foam
good
retention
and
thin
yet
long
lasting
lace
there
is
a
nice
smell
of
citrus
and
grassy
hops
the
flavor
has
some
nice
bready
and
toasted
malts
and
a
mix
of
citrusy
hops
the
body
is
lightmedium
good
carbonation
fits
the
style
dry
finish
it
is
a
nicely
flavored
and
more
complex
than
expected
great
on
a
hot
day
d
this
is
a
fine
summer
beer
light
refreshing
and
well
balanced
its
a
great
session
brew
that
goes
well
with
a
softball
game
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
or
a
day
fishing
under
the
blaring
sun
d
this
one
barely
lasted
ten
minutes
after
a
9mile
run
this
ones
disappearing
and
fast
it
was
lemoney
when
it
hit
my
pallette
followed
by
hints
of
pine
resin
and
fresh
bean
sprouts
emminently
drinkable
a
refreshing
welcome
summer
beer
drinkability
summer
is
in
full
swing
and
this
is
just
the
perfect
to
have
at
the
end
of
a
90
degree
day
after
i
have
finished
mowing
the
lawn
nice
summer
seasonal
d
this
is
a
descent
kolschstyle
ale
very
sessionable
a
very
easy
drinking
german
ale
a
thirst
quencher
and
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
another
good
german
style
beer
from
schells
tasted
on
32908
from
a
sampler
12
pack
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
also
decent
drinkability
in
all
honesty
there
are
a
lot
better
beers
out
there
but
this
one
isnt
bad
especially
considering
the
cheap
price
schells
has
some
great
brews
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
mouthfeel
is
refreshingly
zippy
this
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
for
you
and
all
of
you
bmc
friends
during
cookouts
and
the
like
thanks
ed
for
bringing
a
bit
of
golden
sunshine
and
thoughts
of
warmer
days
to
this
cool
damp
dreary
afternoon
taste
is
hoppy
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
the
same
finish
is
hoppy
and
overall
easy
to
drink
the
hop
is
not
balanced
could
use
a
malt
to
take
the
edge
off
pours
a
yellow
golden
color
with
pillowy
white
head
that
hung
around
a
while
aroma
is
weak
but
is
a
bit
citrusy
flavor
is
also
a
little
underpowered
taste
is
of
honey
and
citrus
lemons
mouthfeel
is
good
and
lacing
on
glass
is
decent
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
has
a
watereddown
quality
about
it
d
overall
a
fine
beer
i
bought
3
six
packs
because
they
were
only
4
each
and
it
was
well
worth
it
very
easy
drinking
medium
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
its
really
easy
to
drink
wellbalanced
and
smooth
the
mouthfeel
was
slighty
heavy
for
the
kolsh
stylesome
grainyness
to
the
textureyet
still
crisp
decent
kolsh
nothing
id
buybut
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
the
yeast
is
very
strong
although
a
bit
overshadowing
of
the
hops
and
malt
the
overall
deal
is
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
at
the
same
time
a
great
yeast
oriented
kolsch
finsh
was
okay
for
a
warm
summers
night
but
i
really
cant
even
consider
this
one
a
good
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
kolsch
and
a
easytodrink
summer
brew
recommended
if
youre
cruising
across
minnesota
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
ive
always
liked
this
beer
and
the
latest
incarnation
does
nothing
to
damper
my
enthusiasm
between
this
and
their
hefe
without
a
doubt
schell
does
two
very
solid
german
style
summer
quaffers
d
schell
has
bette
beers
out
there
than
this
one
not
too
bad
but
id
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
before
returning
to
this
one
thanks
budgood1
for
this
great
summer
beer
refreshing
its
well
worth
a
try
dthis
recipe
was
tweaked
this
year
and
i
like
the
changes
i
was
never
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
this
is
now
decent
the
honey
is
subtle
but
adds
a
nice
touch
and
a
little
depth
i
had
this
on
tap
and
thought
the
honey
was
much
stronger
from
the
keg
a
good
summer
drinker
that
i
will
likely
buy
a
few
more
times
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
big
thanks
to
chad
for
bringing
some
schell
beers
back
from
minnesota
for
us
pours
an
inviting
deep
rich
golden
color
a
nice
thick
frothy
head
that
leaves
very
quickly
alot
of
carbonation
that
lasts
for
a
long
time
has
a
sweetmalty
aroma
very
pleasent
it
has
a
thick
lingering
mouthfeel
with
very
little
flavor
to
speak
of
possibly
a
slight
fruity
hint
hard
to
tell
i
have
to
say
i
was
pleasently
surprised
i
wasnt
expecting
this
solid
of
a
beer
very
welldone
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
kolsch
its
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
really
anytime
for
that
matter
not
really
what
i
expected
from
a
summerfest
beer
this
could
be
their
main
boring
beer
year
long
slapping
the
summerfest
label
on
should
mean
something
a
little
special
right
this
brew
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
if
memory
serve
me
correctly
it
is
a
lot
clearer
than
other
kolschs
i
have
had
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
and
recedes
very
quickly
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
like
all
of
schells
beers
is
of
simple
caramel
malt
and
nothing
else
the
malt
persists
into
the
taste
but
is
toned
down
a
bit
and
some
yeast
does
come
through
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
seems
to
take
away
from
the
taste
overall
this
is
another
disappointment
from
august
schell
brewing
company
my
great
anticipation
for
this
excellently
named
beer
stopped
at
the
massive
malt
barrier
reef
which
encompasses
most
of
the
taste
in
fact
its
like
pushing
the
doughboys
stomach
in
with
your
tongue
trying
to
get
through
the
not
so
sour
doughiness
as
for
it
being
a
summery
beer
it
mostly
fails
its
not
very
crisp
or
refreshing
it
rather
feels
like
a
humid
july
day
where
its
overcast
and
threatens
to
bring
relief
and
the
clouds
build
but
the
rains
never
come
znot
zvery
zgood
looks
like
beer
light
gold
color
it
smells
like
beer
mostly
grainy
with
the
standard
schells
yeast
smell
tast
like
beer
a
little
better
then
some
but
at
the
same
time
worse
than
others
highly
drinkable
especialy
on
a
hot
humid
sweaty
minnesota
summer
day
i
have
yet
to
be
impressed
by
an
august
schell
brewing
company
beer
i
take
that
back
their
pale
ale
is
pretty
damn
good
and
their
pilsner
is
nothing
to
sneeze
at
zommerfest
however
falls
into
line
with
the
rest
and
is
somewhere
between
strictly
average
and
slightly
above
average
finding
a
better
beer
to
cool
off
those
hot
minnesota
summers
shouldnt
be
that
tall
an
order
a
very
solid
session
beer
from
schells
probably
my
favorite
or
second
favorite
from
their
brewery
recommended
deep
golden
almost
reaching
bronze
color
with
a
medium
to
large
frothy
white
head
good
maintenance
on
the
head
and
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
lemony
with
a
grapenut
aspect
and
a
bit
of
spice
but
i
dont
think
spices
were
added
taste
begins
with
a
malty
spice
flavor
quite
smooth
sweetened
barley
flavors
show
themselves
a
citric
aspect
comes
in
and
shuts
down
the
sweetness
while
leaving
the
crisp
malty
flavors
a
nice
little
hoppy
kick
comes
in
the
finish
ends
not
sweet
nor
dry
but
moreso
crisp
than
anything
lighter
body
excels
with
the
solid
moderate
carbonation
easy
drinking
with
just
enough
flavor
and
complexity
to
keep
my
interest
piqued
enjoyable
this
is
a
pretty
decent
kolsch
beer
clean
and
nonoffensive
flavored
yet
light
the
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
pale
straw
clear
with
magic
disappearing
white
head
it
smells
faintly
of
sugar
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
smooth
buttery
sweet
to
bitter
with
a
brisk
snappy
finish
impressively
there
are
no
detectable
offflavors
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
this
is
a
very
refreshing
drinkable
classic
summer
quencher
light
bodied
and
refreshing
a
damn
fine
kolsch
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
and
isnt
going
to
be
my
favorite
style
but
within
this
style
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
mild
aromas
flavors
and
mouthfeel
excellent
summer
brew
i
need
to
have
more
kolsch
style
beers
for
a
better
comparison
but
from
what
i
know
this
gets
two
thumbs
thanks
to
tastytaste
for
this
try
dthis
is
very
smooth
and
gentle
beer
and
good
as
a
seasonal
i
would
like
to
see
just
a
bit
more
flavor
to
give
it
more
of
that
kolsch
style
poured
a
crisp
clear
golden
color
with
very
little
white
head
it
had
a
citris
like
scent
to
it
that
made
it
very
appealing
it
tasted
very
refreshing
and
had
very
mild
flavors
such
as
grain
wheat
lemon
and
some
hop
this
was
a
very
clean
and
crisp
tasting
beer
that
was
very
refreshing
and
tasted
great
right
after
a
long
day
at
work
while
i
have
had
better
beers
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
because
of
its
simplicity
and
modest
taste
its
just
a
simple
and
easy
beer
complimented
with
great
taste
that
i
enjoy
quite
often
bright
clear
golden
color
head
is
small
and
white
but
does
have
some
good
retention
light
grass
malt
and
lemoncitrus
tones
are
in
the
nose
very
light
and
crisp
taste
is
also
very
maltcentric
some
graininess
going
on
with
subtle
citrus
and
a
decent
hops
finish
dry
overall
a
reasonably
priced
smooth
drinking
kolsch
drinkability
this
is
a
good
summer
time
beer
i
could
definitely
polish
a
few
of
these
while
fixing
dinner
at
the
campsite
after
a
long
hike
it
is
refreshing
and
light
enough
but
not
too
light
that
it
bores
me
i
think
its
worth
a
try
strange
beer
this
the
too
fizzy
body
kind
of
kills
any
chance
this
would
have
as
making
a
good
session
ale
and
i
dont
think
itd
really
be
worth
it
for
anything
else
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
bright
gold
color
the
head
is
a
wispy
pale
color
the
aroma
is
nice
and
crisply
refreshing
with
notes
of
lemon
hay
and
a
light
spicy
herbal
character
this
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
up
front
but
then
moves
to
a
nice
sharp
biting
middle
section
and
finish
this
beer
is
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
it
is
lightly
sweet
but
well
balanced
by
a
hoppy
bite
the
hops
are
nicely
present
here
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
for
a
traditional
kolsch
but
i
like
it
even
more
for
it
and
give
a
light
lemonlike
notes
as
well
as
a
grassy
herbal
character
that
is
quite
pleasing
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
cheers
to
hops
drinkability
very
drinkable
much
like
my
glass
of
water
that
i
have
sitting
beside
this
one
i
can
tell
that
its
a
well
done
beer
maybe
its
just
this
style
that
doesnt
work
for
me
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
if
you
are
looking
for
character
look
elsewhere
overall
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
not
bad
either
poured

slightly
cloudy

okay

i
can
dicern
excepting
a
slight
pale

presence
taste
is
subtle
with
pale
malts
and
a
crisp
lemony
character
and
a
slight
hops
bite
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
okay
goes
down
alright
but
could
use
some
more
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
even
a
bit
better
drinkability
is
good
high
session
factor
with
this
one
not
much
bad
about
this
one
but
nothing
noteworthy
jumping
out
at
me
either
could
take
it
or
leave
it
nothing
too
complex
here
just
a
darn
good
brew
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
anyday

that

thanks
for
the
monk
for
this
tasty
minnesota
summer
brew
a
fine
fine
drinker
one
not
to
pass
up
getting
for
those
hotter
summer
days
i
finally
had
to
try
this
beer
out
begging
me
to
purchase
it
from
its
cool
and
safe
display
case
i
began
by
chilling
in
the
cooler
full
of
ice
popped
the
lid
off
smelling
at
first
of
the
pale
ale
i
just
had
about
an
hour
before
with
more
of
a
cool
sensation
taste
was
very
good
finding
a
very
pleasant
mildness
which
i
didnt
expect
since
i
have
never
tried
any
kolsch
style
ale
before
so
i
would
expect
a
hoppy
and
bitter
finish
however
it
was
smooth
as
silk
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
fluffy
with
little
below
perfect
carbonation
drinkability
couple
everyday
and
i
am
sure
id
never
get
tried
of
this
number
from
schells
too
bad
it
is
availble
during
summer
this
brew
is
a
clear
light
gold
color
small
bubbly
white
head
the
scent
has
some
nice
floral
tones
and
a
touch
of
malt
the
taste
is
a
predominantly
hoppy
flavor
very
light
and
refreshing
some
light
malt
tones
as
well
i
might
say
that
from
the
beers
of
this
style
ive
sampled
this
one
does
the
most
for
me
just
got
back
from
mowing
for
8
hours
and
this
hits
the
spot
thanks
zap

vibrant

straight
up
and
down
still

grassy
wheat
notes
not
bad
at
all
with
definite

honey

and
an
herbal

profile
making
for
an
interesting
golden
brew
taste
a
bit
grassy
in
the
malts
sweetness
a
tart
lemon
zing
but
mellow
overall
one
of
the
more
flavorful
brews
from
august
schell
though
i
enjoy
this
brew
not
a
bad
one
at
all
picked
it
up
for
0

cant
complain
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
slightly
sticky
watered
down
honey
texture
very
nice
i
could
make
this
a
lawnmower
beer
without
a
doubt
what
a
great
find
at
a
very
affordable
price
a
rough
pour
delivers
a
slightly
hazy
golden
body
thats
topped
by
a
full
head
of
frothy
brightwhite
foam
which
holds
well
and
initially
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
the
nose
delivers
a
welcoming
combination
of
bready
munich
malt
and
citrusy
light
lemon
and
grassy
hops
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
its
fine
carbonation
delicately
caresses
the
tongue
before
leaving
it
just
slightly
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
delivers
bready
and
lightly
toasted
munich
malts
upfront
followed
by
a
flash
of
citrusy
hops
and
a
rising
bold
bitterness
and
then
a
more
wheatlike
malt
and
grassy
hops
in
the
dry
finish
its
a
surprisingly
flavorful
and
complex
beer
although
its
far
from
what
id
expect
from
an
authentic
version
from
koln
or
the
bonn
region
very
nice
this
is
a
great
interpretation
of
a
kolsch
though
i
still
feel
as
if
ive
yet
to
taste
a
perfect
example
schells
interpretation
is
an
excellent
summer
brew
smooth
refreshing
tasty
light
and
breezy
pack
the
cooler
with
these
babies
and
take
them
to
the
beach
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
very
refreshing
a
rock
soild
summer
brew
and
a
premier
kolsch
hazy
yellow
color
with
moderate
head
that
lasted
a
long
time
and
left
excellent
lacing
the
smell
was
citrusy
sweet
with
a
yeasty
hint
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
was
citrusy
sweet
as
well
with
a
mostly
lemon
character
there
was
a
slight
acidity
to
both
the
smell
and
taste
that
i
did
not
care
for
but
i
have
little
experience
in
the
kolsch
category
to
judge
this
by
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
smooth
long
lasting
flavor
this
refreshing
beer
is
light
and
very
drinkable
clear
darker
yellow
very
pale
head
that
settles
at
14
of
an
inch
distinctive
aroma
from
kolsch
yeast
bread
and
a
touch
of
olive
oil
very
subdued
flavor
just
a
touch
of
ester
and
powdered
sugar
hops
vanguard
are
absolutely
minimal
until
just
a
last
slightly
bitter
catch
close
to
the
swallow
this
is
a
great
quencher
but
as
with
a
lot
of
kolschstyles
and
other
summer
beers
they
set
me
in
the
mood
for
the
beers
of
fall
and
winter
this
perfectly
clear
golden
brew
throws
out
a
nice
sized
whtie
head
with
some
retention
carbonation
is
evident
by
looking
at
it
as
the
gas
bubbles
surface
at
a
nice
clip
a
spicey
hop
laden
malt
aroma
not
too
bad
this
is
a
pretty
decent
tasting
beer
but
it
almost
tastes
more
like
a
pilsner
than
a
kolsch
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
the
fruitiness
that
is
usually
associated
with
kolsch
but
i
do
get
a
bit
more
bitterness
than
a
typical
kolsch
has
pretty
nice
blend
of
pale
munich
and
wheat
malt
good
maltiness
with
a
hop
bite
nice
summer
brew
big
frothy
head
pale
straw
color
and
clear
light
clean
aroma
more
malt
than
hops
nice
soft
ale
quality
to
taste
and
mouthfeel
has
schells
typical
richness
but
not
heavy
smooth
malt
taste
backed
by
bitterness
that
closes
the
sip
neither
is
excessive
or
overwhelming
enjoyable
summer
beer
without
the
crispness
of
lager
not
as
good
as
amber
ale
but
definitely
worth
buying
i
like
it
easy
to
drink
simple
and
great
summer
ale
pours
a
clear
darker
golden
color
with
a
small
but
lacing
head
there
is
a
very
crisp
and
light
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
very
crisp
creamy
nice
pronounced
pale
malt
flavors
some
citrus
notes
nice
full
flavor
good
feel
overall
its
a
stronger
and
very
tasty
kolsch
light
crisp
mild
and
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
overall
ill
see
ye
again
next
summer
matey
cheers
overall
3

best
alaskan
product
i
have
tried
thus
far
if
it
was
sitting
in
a
cooler
at
a
pool
party
id
be
more
inclined
to
grab
this
than
many
others
as
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
without
sacrificing
hops
or
flavor
schells
zommerfest
is
a
far
superior
kolsch
and
so
far
thats
the
only
other
one
i
have
to
compare
it
to
summer
ale
is
right
and
this
is
wheaty
and
zesty
just
like
a
kolsch
should
be
oeasy
drinking
but
lacks
any
really
good
kolsch
flavors
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
special
body
is
light
and
highly
drinkable
fairly
dry
an
overall
pretty
good
brew
cant
find
much
to
complain
about
on
this
one
its
pretty
good
a
solid
well
done
kolsch
easy
drinking
but
still
flavorful
i
think
a
3
6
of
5
is
in
order
overall
pleasant
drinkable
not
outstanding
but
not
bad
either
overall
though
not
attractive
in
the
glass
by
any
means
this
is
a
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
and
is
aptly
named
as
it
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
ill
definitely
come
back
to
this
nice
to
try
but
id
probably
only
pick
this
up
again
if
the
alternative
was
buying
one
of
those
bigname
brand
massproduced
light
beers
o
3
5
wanted
more
tart
flavor
from
a
kolsch
i
can
think
of
a
few
id
rather
have
than
this
one
but
thats
just
me
a
highly
enjoyable
kölsch
not
a
ton
of
character
which
might
be
a
turn
off
to
those
unfamiliar
with
this
style
however
those
who
can
look
past
that
are
in
for
treat
that
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
anywhere
this
poured
a
light
goldenblonde
color
with
a
bit
of
foam
light
aroma
with
a
clean
crisp
easy
drinking
flavor
with
a
touch
of
toasted
biscuit
and
a
light
squeeze
of
orange
blossom
a
fine
beer
a
nice
little
maltforward
ale
perfect
for
a
summer
afternoon
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
ale
nothing
mindblowing
just
easy
drinking
and
tasty
ok
summer
beer
enjoyed
several
of
these
light

beersalso
light
golden

the

an
interesting
flavorsurprisingly
malty
i
tried
this
by
errorthe
keg
i
ordered
was
not
delivered
so
i
took
this
one
insteadand
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
kölsch
but
it
is
worth
trying
overall
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
kölsch
although
perhaps
a
little
bit
unrefined
still
great
on
a
hot
day
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
scents
of
german
ale
yeast
crystal
malt
and
german
hops
flavor
is
crisp
and
clear
with
sweet
malt
and
some
bread
and
slight
citrus
pith
flavors
and
an
excellent
moderate
level
of
hop
bitterness
good
and
flavorful
without
being
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
kolsch
well
worth
trying
its
an
easy
drinking
light
bodied
yet
flavorful
beer
great
for
the
summer
othis
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
but
lacks
any
real
character
from
the
looks
to
the
smell
and
taste
everything
about
the
beer
is
vague
not
bad
just
not
great
or
memorable
on
the
other
hand
i
find
the
feel
to
be
refreshing
and
the
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
without
being
too
light
or
fizzy
and
i
suppose
that
is
what
a
summer
beer
is
for
ive
not
been
super
keen
on
kölsch
in
the
past
but
im
starting
to
come
around
and
alaskan
summer
ale
has
not
hurt
that
process
o
alaskan
summer
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
its
body
is
a
little
more
rich
for
a
kölsch
than
id
like
only
hindering
its
inherent
crispness
the
simplistic
bready
malt
and
undertones
of
fruit
work
very
well
though
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
decent
hue
with
a
slight
head
and
no
real
lacing
nose
is
earthy
grain
and
flora
flavor
is
a
light
combination
of
grass
citrus
and
a
bit
of
a
brassy
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
the
style
can
be
unforgiving
and
i
think
i
may
be
drinking
this
a
bit
too
late
that
said
i
think
i
can
get
enough
from
it
to
know
that
it
would
be
decent
fresh
overall
this
seasonal
offering
from
alaskan
is
a
decent
drinkable
and
fairly
tasty
take
on
a
delicate
style
i
am
not
overly
fond
of
the
style
even
in
the
hottest
of
weather
but
this
wasnt
bad
it
can
quench
a
thirst
to
be
sure
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
is
pretty
relaxing
to
drink
drinkability
light
tasty
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
summer
beer
i
wish
could
buy
locally
o
just
a
straight
out
enjoyable
beer
looks
good
smells
amazing
taste
great
and
feels
wonderful
i
recommend
this
one
if
you
see
it
c
very
clean
and
crisp
light
bodied
well
carbonated
a
typical
kolsch
styled
beer
its
pale
gold
with
solid
head
and
okay
retention
on
top
a
bit
fruity
with
ceral
grains
in
the
nose
similar
in
taste
as
well
with
more
cereal
grains
than
the
fruitiness
light
and
crisp
easy
to
drink
non
offensive
sure
lets
drink
one
this
summer
this
disappointed
me
the
label
is
awesome
but
the
beer
is
pretty
average
it
was
quite
light
when
poured
with
no
lacing
no
head
and
virtually
no
fizz
the
smell
was
nonexistent
the
taste
was
very
rich
but
pretty
sour
for
my
taste
not
something
i
would
have
again
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
from
start
to
finish
which
i
find
delightful
medium
carbonation
and
a
slightly
light
body
round
this
out
to
a
damn
fine
beverage
alaskan
brewing
co
produces
some
mighty
fine
suds
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
one
i
would
drink
over
and
over
again
pretty
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
months
though
its
a
little
sweeter
than
one
may
expect
for
the
style
still
it
went
down
really
easy
and
i
could
see
myself
grabbing
it
on
a
hot
day
decently
bold
for
the
style
the
yeast
and
hops
are
an
interesting
combination
of
fruity
bitterness
its
not
quite
as
crips
and
clean
as
id
like
it
to
be
though
and
i
suppose
i
am
a
bit
spoiled
as
lawnmower
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
interpretations
of
the
style
still
though
a
pretty
tasty
ale
and
its
always
a
good
thing
when
my
beer
is
gone
before
i
can
even
finish
the
review
poured
into
std
pint
glass
with
little
head
although
it
maintained
carbonation
throughout
ive
had
a
couple
other
kolsch
style
beers
recently
and
the
alaskan
comes
up
considerably
weaker
than
the
others
the
distinctive
kolsch
flavor
is
only
slightly
present
in
alaskan
making
this
taste
more
like
an
american
lager
than
a
true
kolsch
this
will
be
my
only
6
for
the
summer
hopefully
they
can
bring
up
the
kolsch
flavor
next
year
o
nice
summer
offering
right
here
if
you
are
looking
to
add
something
new
to
the
summer
rotation
or
just
knock
a
few
back
on
the
porch
or
patio
these
will
go
down
with
ease
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
wheat
with
some
grain
and
a
hint
of
grape
vine
the
flavor
is
similar
with
some
nice
winelike
notes
mixed
in
with
some
yeast
wheat
and
white
pepper
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
kolsch
glad
alaskan
is
now
available
in
texas
pours
out
a
very
translucent
medium
golden
straw
color
with
only
a
light
foam
collar
for
a
head
no
lacing
mediumlight
aroma
and
flavor
of
pale
malt
some
light
generic
fruit
esters
mostly
grassy
hopping
used
as
accent
marks
and
proper
punctuation
for
the
light
malting
breaded
character
very
pleasing
and
refreshingly
light
mouthfeel
which
is
appropriate
to
the
style
aside
from
a
lackluster
head
this
is
one
of
the
better
kolsches
ive
had
to
date
so
i
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
if
you
enjoy
the
style
o
a
great
summer
beer
tasty
refreshing
will
probably
pick
up
a
six
pack
next
time
at
store
poured
from
bottle
into
brooklyn
tulip
pours
a
crystal
clear
yelloworange
color
barely
any
head
at
all
kind
of
surprising
smell
apple
sauce
peach
lots
of
sweet
malt
character
taste
apple
juice
hmm
carbonated
apple
juice
barely
any
hop
presence
and
not
much
depth
at
all
this
isnt
great
dont
see
coming
back
to
it
and
god
dammit
i
bought
a
whole
six
pack
it
also
isnt
too
carbonated
overall
not
pleased
o
a
very
good
brew
very
clean
lots
of
flavor
for
something
with
not
a
lot
of
malthops
delicious
o
an
ok
beer
i
had
much
better
kölsch
beer
at
rock
bottom
chicago
i
dont
recomend
it
sorry
but
a
bit
dissapointed
knowing
that
it
comes
from
a
amazing
brewery
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
not
to
much
here
but
thats
what
makes
this
style
awesome
great
for
a
summer
day
it
would
be
easy
to
kick
a
few
of
these
back
overall
a
good
kolsch
that
will
go
down
nicely
on
a
hot
texas
summer
day
glad
to
finally
see
alaskan
here
in
texas
rotation
the
rare
six
pack
in
the
summer
especially
if
sharing
with
the
noncraft
beer
neighbors
oy
flavors
are
similarly
sweet
some
orange
and
sugar
cookie
notes
pale
malt
and
light
banana
ester
from
the
yeast
a
bit
watery
and
thin
bodied
and
lightly
astringent
not
really
something
id
revisit
with
better
local
options
available
krankshaft
summertime
quite
drinkable
but
it
might
get
tiresome
with
the
rather
flaccid
character
the
12
oz
bottle
from
trader
joes
adjunct
lager
character
on
the
nose
and
on
appearance
but
dont
judge
on
looks
alone
refreshing
summer
beer
that
is
flavorful
and
clean
good
take
on
an
obscure
style
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
no

faint
lemons
with
hints
of
dough
and
cake
the
flavor
is
balanced
even
if
plain
with
a
mix
of
crisp
malt
and
hoppiness
theres
a
faint
taste
of
medicine
in
the
finish
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
sticky
alaskan
summer
ale
is
a
decent
beer
recommended
oa
nice
beer
nothing
overpowering
just
nice
light
easy
drinking
flavors
lighterbodied
and
heavily
carbonated
light
flavor
profile
and
immensely
refreshing
but
surprisingly
complex
not
the
best
kölsch
ive
tried
but
it
has
all
the
attributes
to
make
an
excellent
session
ale
thanks
to
cyberkedi
for
this
one
enjoyed
the
sixpack
that
i
bought
i
generally
dont
like
the
kolsch
style
but
this
was
nice
good
when
its
warm
because
the
flavors
come
out
but
most
enjoyable
when
its
cold
on
a
side
note
i
like
orcas
pretty
much
what
i
expected
nothing
earthshattering
not
much
to
challenge
your
palate
but
a
good
recommendable
kolsch
drinkability
good
flavors
well
balanced
a
good
interpretation
of
the
kölsch
style
which
is
a
style
i
really
enjoy
when
its
done
right
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
its
a
good
spring
or
summer
brew
this
is
an
interesting
beer
most
of
the
other
kolsch
beers
ive
had
reminded
me
of
minipilsners
but
this
is
out
on
its
own
island
very
dry
crackerlike
flavor
is
interesting
but
seems
to
be
missing
a
component
didnt
really
look
good
or
smell
like
anything
so
i
cant
really
give
above
average
marks
there
still
i
would
say
this
is
worth
a
try
o
americanized
or
not
this
is
a
pretty
solid
example
of
a
kolsch
to
me
hits
the
spot
just
right
for
the
summer
months
clear
golden
colored
brew
chill
haze
very
big
white
head
good
amount
of
lace
scent
is
light
sweet
biscuity
malt
just
a
touch
of
floral
hop
pilsner
malt
front
bready
a
bit
grassy
some
slight
hop
influence
pretty
full
bodied
overall
pretty
soft
but
there
is
a
bit
of
sharpness
to
it
not
gonna
go
wrong
with
this
during
a
hot
summers
day
aroma
is
malty
with
a
yeasty
overtone
and
a
hint
of
fruit
like
summer
sunshine
it
pours
a
typical
clear
amber
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
flavor
is
malty
and
fruity
with
hints
of
caramel
and
honey
not
complex
but
still
refreshing
smooth
texture
has
a
decent
tingle
to
it
and
leaves
behind
a
fruity
fizz
not
great
but
grab
a
bottle
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
good
taste
well
balanced
not
the
best
lager
ive
had
but
its
drinkable
poured
goldenyellow
with
about
an
inch
of
foam
not
much
for
an
aroma
mostly
grain
and
malt
taste
is
grain
and
sweet
malt
with
a
just
bit
of
a
hop
and
citrus
presence
toward
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
overall
its
solid
aptly
named
summer
ale
o
decent
summer
beer
for
1
29
for
a
single
not
much
there
but
then
again
the
style
does
not
scream
complexity
either
its
crisp
and
refreshing
no
where
near
as
good
as
a
german
kolsch
but
it
hit
the
spot
just
fine
on
tap
at
seattle
taproom
pours
deep
golden
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
of
grassy
perfume
hops
and
biscuit
malt
medium
slightly
crisp
body
light
crisp
grassy
malt
is
balanced
on
the
palate
by
biscuit
malt
and
hints
of
tropical
fruit
short
light
finish
easy
drinking
brew
one
of
the
best
kolsch
ive
tried
o
not
outstanding
but
overall
a
good
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
need
a
quality
refreshing
beer
that
tastes
good
solid
overall
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
spots
of
lacing
dot
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
grains
citrus
and
some
fruity
notes
taste
is
exactly
the
same
with
the
sweet
grain
taste
being
the
most
prominent
and
the
fruit
flavors
coming
through
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
carbonation
level
but
is
still
bubbly
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
can
see
why
this
would
be
a
summer
selection
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
lower
abv
but
nothing
all
that
special
i
picked
a
single
bottle
of
this
up
a
general
store
at
the
grand
canyon
since
alaskan
doesnt
distribute
to
new
mexico
glad
i
did
although
a
wont
lose
any
sleep
over
not
having
access
to
this
beer
here
in
nm
it
would
be
an
excellent
pick
for
a
six
pack
when
i
go
to
hood
canal
in
washington
next
month
overall
a
good
version
of
a
kolsch
nothing
outstanding
but
a
pretty
good
summer
brew
around
2001
this
beer
provided
an
important
lesson
for
me
in
beer
appreciation
as
newer
american
beers
were
introduced
to
me
it
was
easy
to
assume
that
every
unfamiliar
style
was
therefore
a
newlycreated
style
in
fact
they
were
usually
trying
to
follow
a
precedent
already
established
by
traditional
stylesusually
in
other
countries
alaskan
summer
ale
taught
me
a
new
word
kolsch
i
came
to
realize
that
alaskan
was
not
inventing
new
styles
of
beer
they
were
just
remembering
and
teaching
beer
history
it
was
a
useful
and
necessary
lesson
to
learn
o
decent
its
a
kolsch
so
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
its
well
made
for
the
style
pretty
easy
drinking
o
this
is
my
first
crack
at
an
alaskan
brew
since
they
arrived
in
minnesota
nice
and
crisp
good
balance
of
sweetness
very
refreshing
im
looking
forward
to
picking
up
a
couple
of
sixers
this
summer
clear
bright
yellow
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
had
good
retention
the
head
settles
to
a
very
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
consists
of
some
bicuity
malt
and
slight
fruity
esters
not
getting
much
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
fruity
which
comes
as
a
suprise
in
a
kolsch
malt
is
semidry
and
bready
what
is
not
surpising
is
the
light
body
and
lively
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
compliments
hot
summer
days
not
the
best
kolsch
i
have
ever
had
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
soft
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
one
evening
welcome
to
minnesota
alaskan
brewing
company
alaskan
summer
kolshstyle
ale
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
from
the
12
ounce
bottle
a
cap
of
white
foam
followed
the
beer
down
leaving
lacy
traces
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
as
expected
for
the
style
with
pale
malt
contributing
the
most
the
flavors
are
pale
malt
with
a
little
sweetness
underlying
it
very
little
bite
at
the
end
par
for
the
style
this
is
a
fine
summer
ale
refreshing
after
a
day
in
the
sun
sun
yellow
body
clarity
is
good
carbonation
looks
to
be
moderately
high
as
many
tiny
bubbles
surface
at
a
nice
clip
nice
and
fresh
boquet
of
light
biscuity
malts
and
floral
hops
feel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
light
bready
malt
base
with
hay
and
lemon
sprinkled
on
top
hops
provide
a
very
slight
dryness
to
the
beer
fairly
decent
kolsch
its
hard
to
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
kolsch
but
i
have
had
some
that
were
pretty
outstanding
this
is
not
that
but
yet
a
good
summer
quaffer
overall
overly
simplified
and
dehopped
version
of
a
kolsch
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
enough
there
to
truly
desire
buying
it
again
o
nothing
outstanding
here
but
a
decent
light
easy
drinking
brew
good
for
the
summer
and
will
drink
some
more
singles
of
this
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
spicy
noble
hops
bready
malt
and
a
hint
of
metal
this
is
a
very
pleasing
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
maltier
than
the
aroma
with
the
spiciness
only
showing
in
the
back
ground
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
notes
light
and
crisp
alaskan
summer
ale
is
a
good
interpretation
of
the
kölsch
style
theres
not
alot
to
it
but
its
still
a
decent
session
beer
for
the
season
overall
this
is
not
bad
at
all
but
put
in
the
category
of
a
kolsch
and
i
have
had
much
much
better
still
i
would
go
for
it
in
a
pinch
o
overall
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
but
was
boring
it
seems
this
summer
ale
was
designed
to
be
palatable
to
a
wide
spectrum
of
beer
drinkers
the
beer
was
balanced
well
but
there
werent
any
specific
characteristics
that
made
me
look
forward
to
drinking
the
rest
of
the
sixer
the
name
says
it
all
a
great
light
beer
for
hot
days
and
nights
pours
a
clear
golden
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
hint
of
hop
and
a
hint
of
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
kolsch
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
hint
of
yeast
hint
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
grain
overall
decent
blend
and
body
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
crisp
but
is
warmer
and
more
full
than
i
expected
its
never
watery
which
is
a
good
thing
drinkability
is
ok
but
could
have
definitely
used
some
bitterness
to
the
finish
as
it
is
it
is
solid
but
unspectacular
looks
perfectly
average
slightly
better
color
than
a
basic
adjunct
lager
a
little
darker
and
golden
hued
weak
thin
head
that
doesnt
last
very
lively
beer
lots
of
bubbles
smell
is
that
classic
kölsch
odor
like
tart
dust
is
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
smell
is
dry
and
musty
to
say
there
is
some
fruit
in
there
might
be
a
stretch
but
i
think
i
detect
some
grape
and
lime
aromas
actually
not
a
whole
lot
of
malt
smells
but
i
dont
detect
much
in
the
way
of
adjuncts
i
cant
tell
what
exactly
gives
kölsch
that
specific
aroma
perhaps
the
type
of
hops
used
cant
tell
either
way
i
dont
like
that
smell
very
much
ive
smelled
worst
but
still
it
doesnt
do
it
for
me
taste
is
of
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
then
the
delicate
hops
tinniness
of
the
style
takes
over
and
ruins
it
all
for
me
reminds
me
of
lime
rinds
or
mint
leaves
a
weird
sweet
tart
and
musty
taste
overall
not
a
bad
brew
and
maybe
not
a
bad
american
version
of
the
style
hop
flavor
could
be
more
distinct
taste
lots
of
carbonation
minimal
hop
presence
interesting
aftertaste
slightly
metallic
and
earthy
at
the
same
time
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
hot
weather
girlfriend
beer
feel
and
drinkability
this
brew
is
somehow
full
and
light
but
not
weak
it
is
creamy
with
none
of
that
annoying
overcarbonated
sense
that
similar
beers
sometimes
have
its
called
summer
for
a
reason
and
one
could
easily
spend
an
entire
summer
afternoon
at
the
lake
throwing
back
pints
of
this
tasty
libation
d
a
decent
brew
seems
true
to
style
id
have
another
i
dont
know
what
my
problem
was
with
this
beer
maybe
it
was
the
style
or
maybe
it
was
the
brewery
but
it
just
wasnt
working
for
me
if
i
had
to
put
my
finger
on
one
thing
i
didnt
like
about
it
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
malt
flavor
just
grossed
me
out
it
was
too
sweet
and
really
just
gross
for
a
summer
beer
i
dont
want
something
that
malty
and
if
it
is
malty
at
least
make
it
a
good
malt
flavor
there
really
wasnt
much
of
a
hop
flavor
either
which
would
have
helped
im
sure
no
head
whatsoever
no
lacing
and
since
i
didnt
like
the
flavor
it
was
hard
to
drink
hard
to
finish
too
i
mean
it
wasnt
god
awful
it
wasnt
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
so
i
cant
grade
it
too
low
it
just
really
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
pale
golden
hazy
pour
with
bright
white
head
forming
fine
speckled
lacing
aroma
clean
mild
fruitiness
with
a
biscuit
pale
malt
breadiness
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
and
mineral
water
flavor
has
a
balanced
blend
of
light
herbal
hops
pale
biscuit
flavored
hops
mild
fruitiness
from
the
ale
yeast
again
the
mineral
water
mild
metallic
tone
in
the
finish
works
and
really
cleanses
the
palate
between
sips
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
sturdy
carbonation
perfect
for
summer
time
refreshment
this
one
held
up
quite
nicely
this
late
into
the
fall
drinkability
solid
drinking
well
this
indian
summer
a
nice
version
of
a
kolsch
definitely
blends
nicely
with
the
rest
of
alaskan
brewings
lineup
pours
a
golden
straw
color
head
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
wheat
a
little
fruity
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
tastes
a
little
of
dough
wheat
and
citrus
has
a
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
overall
its
an
enjoyable
summer
beer
its
my
first
kolsch
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
it
was
good
pours
a
light
thin
straw
color
with
he
tiniest
bit
of
an
orange
hue
thin
head
and
negligible
lacig
as
it
goes
down
nose
is
pretty
light
with
wheat
but
brigs
forward
some
fruity
elements
i
get
a
bit
of
lemon
and
maybe
some
tangerine
flavor
draws
back
a
bit
with
some
wheat
and
a
bit
of
hops
some
fruity
elements
remain
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
not
too
much
flavor
but
a
nice
feel
and
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
nonthreatening
summer
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
most
nice
flavors
aside
from
i
think
it
would
have
been
nicer
to
have
a
clean
finish
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
summer
afternoon
or
night
or
morning
if
you
live
in
florida
drinkability
an
excellent
summer
beer
and
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
i
could
have
a
six
of
these
a
very
clean
beer
nothing
fancy
just
good
beer
overall
it
is
what
it
says
summer
ale
great
easy
drinking
beer
that
even
a
bud
miller
or
coors
drinker
would
like
i
really
like
the
smooth
finish
of
this
really
good
a
nice
kolsch
crisp
and
malty
good
for
even
a
pseudo
canadian
summertime
d
an
inoffensive
beer
that
is
decent
but
otherwise
unremarkable
much
better
on
tap
pours
strawgold
with
medium
clarity
and
a
thin
head
aroma
is
feint
flowery
light
taste
is
clean
and
simple
good
balance
with
a
tip
toward
hoppy
bitterness
hops
here
are
floral
and
subdued
taste
is
thin
and
clean
but
not
watery
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
im
not
sure
if
summer
actually
ever
arrives
in
juneau
but
the
folks
at
alaska
have
made
a
nice
kolsch
all
the
same
it
poured
a
dark
golden
color
that
was
clear
and
slightly
bubbly
the
aroma
was
almost
nonpresent
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
grain
present
for
taste
it
was
a
bit
of
grain
and
corn
without
much
to
enjoy
it
was
like
a
macro
beer
with
a
tad
bit
of
extra
flavor
and
no
nastiness
it
wasnt
bad
tasting
it
just
didnt
have
much
to
offer
plus
since
this
was
considered
a
premium
beer
at
the
bbq
place
it
wasnt
worth
what
i
payed
for
it
not
a
repeat
buy
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
nice
white
head
and
good
retention
and
lacing
almost
looks
like
a
macro
but
its
not
quite
that
yellow
or
fizzy
smell
was
of
dry
malt
and
straw
perhaps
a
little
citrus
orange
peel
smell
but
faint
taste
was
pretty
clean
and
straightforward
dry
malt
grassy
hops
and
a
general
crispness
mouthfeel
was
light
slightly
oily
aftertaste
overall
a
good
beer
and
representative
of
its
style
doesnt
stand
out
a
ton
but
i
would
revisit
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
a
prickly
amount
of
carbonation
d
overall
its
a
good
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
months
nothing
amazing
just
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
worth
a
try
drinkability
i
was
really
let
down
by
the
alaskan
white
but
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
that
said
i
do
not
know
what
a
benchmark
kolsch
is
supposed
to
be
so
i
can
only
rate
this
beer
on
its
own
merits
and
it
comes
out
solid
for
a
summer
ale
bought
as
a
single
bottle
from
99
bottles
in
federal
way
washington
very
drinkable
crisp
refreshing
and
some
fruity
esters
coming
through
i
liked
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
and
i
will
probably
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
in
the
future
decently
priced
also
i
like
this
beer
and
if
i
could
get
it
regularly
i
probably
would
d
hey
its
nice
light
and
simple
pretty
much
what
i
was
looking
for
sure
it
could
use
a
bit
more
but
its
all
good
easy
drinking
and
not
bad
by
any
measure
actually
quite
damned
enjoyable
glad
i
got
the
shot
at
it
d
kolschs
tend
to
be
very
drinkable
and
this
is
no
differen
t
d
great
summertime
lawnmower
beer
very
sessionable
although
i
usually
prefer
hoppier
or
darker
beers
this
would
be
awesome
on
a
sunny
day
out
at
safeco
field
or
even
while
tending
to
a
hot
grill
notes
bjcpkolsch
first
time
having
this
style
so
i
cant
compare
to
the
real
thing
i
couldnt
feel
the
5
30
abv
as
i
was
drinking
this
and
it
was
only
after
i
had
the
whole
bottle
down
that
i
felt
a
slight
buzz
while
this
isnt
a
typical
summer
ale
or
hefeweizen
this
would
be
a
decent
choice
for
those
warm
days
where
something
with
a
bit
more
substance
is
called
for
pours
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
dies
down
to
a
very
active
carb
a
very
dry
beer
not
much
aftertaste
a
little
sweet
some
tartness
hops
are
very
mild
malt
is
there
and
also
very
tame
some
citrus
tones
a
great
beer
at
a
great
price
for
a
hot
summer
day
recommended
m
d
this
is
a
nice
summer
brew
it
is
tasty
and
makes
a
good
session
brew
summer
poured
a
lightly
hazy
pale
lemon
yellow
color
with
a
head
of
foam
that
wasnt
all
that
special
the
head
of
foam
was
about
12
to
34
of
an
inch
in
height
pure
white
in
color
and
just
a
bit
on
the
fizzy
side
this
fizzy
head
actually
good
retention
that
left
behind
a
string
of
white
rings
and
3
tiny
spots
of
lace
around
the
glass
at
first
this
beer
had
an
average
toasted
aroma
of
toasted
malts
and
not
much
of
anything
else
that
changed
slightly
when
it
was
swirled
around
when
it
was
swirled
around
a
nice
light
juicy
fruit
aroma
and
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
emerges
from
the
background
i
thought
the
taste
was
going
to
start
off
malty
and
then
roll
gently
into
some
hops
instead
this
beer
did
the
opposite
this
beer
started
off
with
crispy
floral
hops
and
when
the
hops
reached
their
peakness
the
taste
then
rolled
into
a
nice
solid
maltyness
this
was
a
light
bodied
beer
that
certainly
wasnt
light
in
flavor
in
the
end
this
was
a
great
summer
time
treat
it
had
session
written
all
over
it
i
just
wish
i
had
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
beer
poured
with
a
spare
white
head
that
diminished
quickly
to
a
thin
film
body
was
clear
and
flat
with
a
darkyellow
color
aroma
was
of
light
malt
and
some
slight
citrus
lightbodied
and
thin
on
the
palate
with
average
carbonation
taste
was
of
a
short
duration
but
it
was
good
lightly
sweet
again
with
some
citrus
overall
it
was
fine
but
nothing
great
high
drinkability
in
that
it
goes
down
very
easy
pours
a
light
golden
colored
body
with
nearly
no
head
whitish
in
color
malty
aroma
some
freshness
enticing
malty
nutty
taste
refreshing
effervescent
not
skunky
tasting
pretty
tasting
a
little
heavier
than
a
typical
summer
beer
a
drinkable
summer
ale
but
not
much
more
than
that
nothing
overly
exciting
and
i
wish
the
beer
was
brighter
but
overall
a
tasty
take
on
a
kölsch
and
a
very
worthy
session
brew
prost
dark
gold
in
color
and
very
still
some
random
prickle
pops
around
in
the
glass
and
there
is
no
head
to
speak
of
sweet
malty
nose
is
okay
the
attack
is
refreshing
and
clean
and
leads
you
to
believe
it
will
be
a
nice
simple
easy
drinking
beer
the
flavor
has
a
strong
sour
grain
flavor
it
seems
a
bit
heavy
to
me
for
a
summer
ale
the
aftertaste
is
sour
compared
to
other
summer
ales
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
but
i
get
that
summer
in
alaska
is
different
than
summer
in
other
places
it
just
doesnt
seem
all
that
much
like
a
warm
weather
beer
a
little
heavy
and
sour
d
i
love
this
beer
maybe
that
initial
reaction
is
a
little
harsh
but
this
was
a
kinda
wimpy
beer
for
me
i
know
that
that
is
the
style
but
i
have
had
better
versions
of
it
in
the
end
it
is
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
than
your
average
macro
but
i
am
pretty
underwhelmed
here
i
have
very
little
experience
with
this
style
but
this
isnt
a
half
bad
beer
i
cant
say
that
im
blown
away
by
it
but
as
compared
against
other
summer
beers
american
wheats
and
various
lagers
its
alright
the
beer
pours
an
almost
offputting
shade
of
yellowish
orange
with
essentially
no
head
or
lacing
of
any
kind
the
nose
is
malty
but
light
and
not
particularly
engaging
that
said
its
sweet
and
bready
and
doesnt
smell
off
at
all
the
taste
brings
in
some
spicy
hops
and
a
faint
vinous
character
there
just
isnt
enough
depth
of
character
to
bring
out
any
more
interesting
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
effervescent
and
would
be
even
more
enjoyable
given
a
different
flavor
profile
ultimately
its
an
ok
beer
with
a
bland
recipe
i
dont
know
why
a
brewer
would
choose
to
make
a
kölsch
specifically
at
any
rate
alaskan
does
not
make
a
very
strong
case
for
the
style
d
very
drinkable
definitely
something
that
i
think
would
be
universally
inoffensive
d
flavorful
and
refreshing
not
too
complex
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
not
a
great
beer
but
its
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
its
tough
when
a
brewer
slaps
kolsch
on
a
label
the
style
is
so
narrow
and
there
is
only
a
small
handful
of
true
kolschs
that
are
sent
to
the
us
from
germany
a
little
to
alelike
rather
than
kolsch
this
is
not
to
say
that
this
beer
is
not
a
decent
quaff
its
sums
up
to
be
a
simple
golden
ale
at
best
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
but
i
cant
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
one
the
flavors
just
dont
jump
out
like
i
was
hoping
d
very
high
if
you
are
just
looking
for
something
to
throw
back
while
watching
a
game
or
snacking
on
some
pretzels

mske
this
quite
quaffable
in
fact
i
forced
myself
to
sip
the
first
round
but
after
that
it
was
game
on
and
i
found
myself
pouring
them
down
drinkability
kolsch
is
as
drinkable
as
a
beer
gets
light
very
mild
on
both
hops
and
malts
sadly
this
kolsch
is
simply
boring
and
lifeless
not
undrinkable
just
not
worth
a
second
glass
pours
a
luminous
golden
color
transparent
with
reasonable
white
head
nose
is
citrusy
and
metallic
some
metallic
components
on
the
palate
too
with
a
nice
herbal
presence
and
crisp
light
refreshing
malt
faint
sour
element
that
disappears
near
the
finish
very
refreshing
and
something
i
would
love
with
good
american

balanced
good

mildly
pleasing
overall
d
tasty
and
refreshing
yet
quite
atypical
compared

the
others
of
its

that
ive
had
this
would
be
great
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
refreshing
overall
another
great
release
from
alaskan
i
love
this
brewing
company
d
this
beer
met
my
expectations
and
is
good
for
style
when
you
look
at
it
after
pouring
it
in
a
glass
you
notice
the
beauty
that
is
the
summer
ale
its
a
light
golden

and
very

great
i
had
a
case
of
it
straight
from
the
state
of
alaska
this
year
and
i
think
i
still
have
a
couple
left
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
one
after
the
other
overall
kolsch
is
not

as
short

as
it
may
be
not
really
much
of
a
backbone
to
this
brew
but
can
be
enjoyed
in
quantity
recommend
trying
with
some
fresh
halibut
sushi
salud
this
is
definately
a
chill
beer
in
every
sense
of
the
word
i
think
its
a
pretty
wellcrafted
summer
beer
its
got
a
nice
citrusy
flavor
and
it
goes
down
incredibly
easily
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
too
quickly
this
is
my
second
beer
from
the
alaskan
brewing
co
i
would
say
that
im
quite
pleased
with
what
they
have
to
offer
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
their
alaskan
amber
but
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
their
stuff
poured
a
straw
colored
yellow
wit
some
decent
cartbonation
nose
was
fruity
lemon
and
some
other
light
citrus
undertones
to
it
the
flavor
carries
more
of
the
bready
malt
flavor
and
has
a
slight
sournessmaybe
from
the
lemon
and
citrus
and
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
keep
it
interesting
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
my
fav
seasonal
i
found
this
to
be
a
really
interesting
beer
the
assertive
hops
were
a
pleasant
surprise
they
totally
dominate
this
beer
but
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
but
overall
a
decently
drinkable
summer
ale
pours
a
pale
and
clear
amber
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipates
alaskan
summer
ale
smells
of
wheat
malts
and
a
faint
bit
of
hops
tastes
pretty
good
for
a
kolsch
albeit
it
tasted
a
bit
more
yeasty
than
other
kolsches
i
have
tried
it
had
some
malt
followed
by
a
tart
lemon
flavor
and
a
bit
of
hops
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
not
too
watery
drinkability
is
good
this
one
goes
down
real
easy
and
has
enough
complexity
going
on
to
separate
it
from
the

brews
d
highly
drinkable
great
summer
beer
true
to

a
bit
of
a

got
to
enjoy
this
on
a
cruise
in
seattle
hard
to
discern
the
flavor
carries
more
of

and
has
a

in


clearly
alaska
brewing
was
no
match
for
this
difficult
style
royaltoct

and
a
very
drinkable
beer
freedjun

just
that
it
was
smooth
nice
dark
yellowish
color
and
firm
small
head
had
a
good
sweetness
i
was
not
a
fan
of
summits
summer
ale
even
though
most
are
just
not
my
taste
overall
a
decent
kolsch
although
to
me
something
seemed
slightly
off
the
can
is
fresh
so
thats
not
the
issue
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
ive
had
nothing
extraordinary
but
pleasant
nice
price
too
pretty
nice
summertime
beer
overall
an
excellent
refreshing
summer
brew
a
sessionable
alcohol
level
of
4
4
and
a
flavor
that
isnt
a
hop
slap
or
a
cloying
syrup
nicely
balanced
ill
buy
more
this
summer
o
excellent
summer
beer
probably
my
favorite
easily
drinkable
very
refreshing
not
the
most
on
flavor
but
definitely
a
good
example
of
a
kolsch
o
a
very
good
kolsch
its
a
style
i
struggle
to
describe
because
when
its
done
right
is
a
light
dry
beer
with
some
potential
fruitiness
that
is
great
a
summer
session
beer
much
like
what
we
have
here
with
summits
summer
ale
an
aggro
head
netted
me
two
pillowy
fingers
of
dense
bonewhite
head
that
took
forever
to
fall
even
in
the
days
humidity
color
was
a
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
strongly
of
noble
hops
with
a
lemony
tartness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
very
lemony
in
the
mouth
boy
did
i
pick
the
right
one
for
this
humid
evening
it
was
like
lemon
sorbet
in
its
taste
as
well
as
its
refreshing
thirstquenching
nature
finish
was
semidry
still
quite
lemony
and
very
tasty
great
summer
beer
makes
me
want
to
find
more
from
this
brewer
a
the
beer
is
clear
light
yellow
in
color
and
has
no
visible
carbonation
it
poured
with
a
quarter
finger
high
white
head
that
died
down
leaving
a
thin
head
covering
the
surface
and
some
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
seem
like
a
true
kölschi
couldnt
detect
any
grapelike
flavors
in
the
taste
an
alright
kosch
like
most
of
summits
offerings
decent
drinkable
but
not
memorable
fairly
true
to
style
great
summer
session
bier
overall
slightly
above
average
beer
goes
down
really
easy
not
much
taste
however
i
assume
that
this
is
true
to
the
style
after
reading
the
description
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
style
overall
it
did
its
job
but
nothing
more
definitely
wont
buy
again
although
i
remain
a
fan
of
summits
other
brews
overall
a
nice
refreshing
summer
ale
d
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
form
this
brew
as
ive
never
had
a
kölsch
before
i
figured
id
get
more
yeast
and
less
hops
something
akin
to
a
hefeweizen
this
reminded
me
more
of
an
apwa
but
with
both
more
hops
and
malt
all
in
all
a
tasty
and
drinkable
summer
brew
from
summit
overall
a
good
summer
session
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
its
smooth
body
light
abv
and
more
simple
but
flavorful
crisp
taste
thanks
aaron
immensely
drinkable
fresh
malt
flavors
from
start
to
finish
hoppiness
balances
and
shows
off
a
little
summit
has
certainly
brightened
up
my
summer
a
bit
more
with
this
one
light
color
very
crisp
aroma
subtle
hop
presence
consistent
with
the
style
refreshing
easy
drinking
the
4
5
abv
note
the
4
9
abv
shown
with
the
listing
here
is
not
current
and
crisp
refreshing
taste
means
you
could
pound
back
more
than
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
evening
pours
a
cloudy
light
straw
color
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
but
left
some
lacing
the
nose
is
wheatlike
the
taste
is
light
but
pleasantly
dry
there
was
a
touch
of
tingling
bitterness
on
the
finish
which
is
the
highlight
of
this
offering
a
thank
you
goes
out
to
cpolking
form
sending
this
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
malts
taste
is
bready
malts
some
grains
a
touch
of
hops
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
easy
drinking
summer
beer
next
time
its
in
the
90s
this
will
go
down
great
but
so
does
water
im
not
trying
to
knock
summer
ale
because
its
not
aimed
at
me
but
i
will
miss
the
hefe
weizen
considerably
if
this
is
its
replacement
this
beer
pours
a
semiclear
golden
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
a
thin
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
herbal
spicy
hops
with
an
underlying
breadiness
it
is
rather
weak
though
and
i
have
to
try
really
hard
to
detect
it
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
nice
balance
of
bready
malt
and
spicy
herbal
hops
again
like
the
aroma
it
is
weak
even
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
i
really
dont
think
highly
of
this
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
the
kolsch
style
however
this
is
a
weaker
example
of
the
style
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
again
a
decent
summer
beer
fairly
clean
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
summer
brew
overall
i
like
this
one
tastes
like
a
light
bodied
pilsner
with
an
emphasis
on
the
hops
i
should
get
the
summer
sampler
to
compare
this
side
by
side
with
their
pilsner
reminds
me
a
lot
of
it
right
now
mmm
reminds
me
a
bit
of
summits
kolsch
from
a
couple
summers
back
the
slight
earthy
mineral
note
is
subdued
but
theres
still
a
wonderfully
subtle
character
of
bready
malts
mellow
citrus
hops
and
light
fruit
esters
complex
yet
drinkable
what
a
fine
beer
it
opens
with
freshbaked
bread
and
finishes
with
a
dry
grassy
bitterness
ill
have
another
overall
this
is
a
great
offering
from
summit
and
something
i
will
be
having
in
the
fridge
this
summer
very
easy
to
drink
yet
provides
a
nice
flavor
o
a
great
addition
to
light
and
refreshing
summer
beers
with
a
nicely
bitter
hoppiness
when
the
craving
hits
i
was
looking
for
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
on
sale
and
this
beer
filled
my
craving
for
something
light
and
hoppy
at
the
same
time
i
just
wish
that
tart
vegetal
character
wasnt
so
prominent
overall
i
would
say
that
summit
has
hit
upon
something
good
here
after
messing
around
with
the
hefe
and
scandia
not
sure
where
this
rates
compared
to
those
two
but
the
ultimate
comparison
will
be
to
see
how
this
stands
up
to
the
schell
zommerfest
as
go
to
summer
slammers
for
my
drinking
pleasure
stay
tuned
perfect
summertime
brew
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
kolsch
its
everything
you
would
expect
from
the
style
very
good
summer
beer
a
bit
lacking
in
character
but
clean
and
a
reasonable
approximation
of
the
style
o
a
session
thirst
quencher
with
mid
kolsch
flavors
not
my
first
choice
for
a
kolsch
or
a
summer
beer
for
the
matter
overall
this
is
not
as
good
as
the
unchained
kolsch
that
came
out
a
few
years
back
but
that
was
a
truly
elite
offering
this
is
definitely
solid
and
will
be
a
nice
summer
beer
i
plan
on
doing
a
blind
taster
with
this
and
four
other
kolschs
to
see
how
it
stands
schells
zommerfestalaskan
summer
and
goose
island
summer
right
now
i
would
say
that
matchup
is
a
toss
up
with
perhaps
a
slight
edge
to
gi
well
see
may
update
this
when
i
do
that
this
is
a
nice
summer
ale
soft
and
well
blended
flavors
should
work
for
the
masses
and
could
make
a
nice
lawnmower
beer
enjoyable
summer
brew
that
is
different
from
boring
hot
weather
beers
i
did
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
the
unchained
kolsch
from
a
couple
years
ago
but
being
produced
on
a
larger
scale
i
understand
that
compromises
had
to
be
made
much
better
than
their
hefe
weizen
which
this
replaced
but
i
still
miss
the
old
scandia
ale
summer
seasonal
notes
light
in
body
with
subtle
flavor
and
great
balance
glad
they
decided
to
try
something
different
this
summer
quite
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
well
done
o
overall
a
nice
kolsch
very
reminiscent
of
the
german
kolschs
ive
had
in
the
past
in
the
mineral
taste
i
look
forward
to
having
more
of
this
during
the
summer
o
great
drinkability
nice
and
refreshing
another
great
seasonal
brew
from
summit
glad
it
replaced
the
hefe
clear
pale
gold
colour
lasting
sticky
head
fresh
bread
honey
hay
and
flowers
in
the
nose
very
gentle
crisp
flavour
a
bit
of
soft
grainy
malt
up
front
is
followed
by
an
intising
floralhaylike
hop
character
noticeable
hop
bitterness
for
a
dry
curt
finish
carbonation
is
prickly
but
not
overdone
sub
5
abv
makes
this
a
beer
you
can
reasonabley
consume
in
quantity
well
done
a
perfect
summer
beer
that
really
seems
to
capture
the
essence
of
the
season
o
this
is
a
home
run
from
summit
a
well
made
summer
beer
i
dont
care
the
style
or
the
flavor
this
is
an
all
around
awesome
summer
beer
ill
be
drinking
a
ton
of
this
over
the
summer
and
enjoying
every
last
drop
seek
this
beer
out
and
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
it
i
know
i
will
be
this
would
be
extremely
easy
to
put
back
several
very
clean
and
refreshing
yet
has
enough
depth
as
to
not
get
boring
this
makes
a
great
summer
drinker
really
nice
summer
beer
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
but
this
beer
is
pretty
good
o
a
good
beer
to
have
around
with
goose
islands
summertime
relegated
only
to
the
mixed

these
days

felt

both

and
it

smooth

refreshing
going
down
nice
light
beer
will
absolutely
seek
out
and
purchase
again
flavor
is
crisp
and
refreshing
initially
with
a
fruity
toucha
lightly
sweet
bready
backbone
and
a
slightly

finish
its
a

than
most
and
diacetyl
becomes
evident
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
is
ok
nothing
that
spectacular
with
this
one
would
make
an
ok
session
beer
with
some
food
o
good
but
i
like
fruh
a
lot
better
loved
it
will
drink
it
again
great
flavor
this
version
of
an
americankolsch
which
is
simple
straightforward
and
very
mild
pretty
sure
thats
what
they
were
going
for
its
a
fine
beer
for
what
it
is
and
i
would
have
no
problems
drinking
this
again
simple
in
a
good
way
people
compared
it
to
sam
adams
summer
ale
i
swear
ive
had
this
before
weird
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
bread
mild
stonefruit
a
hint
of
sweetgrass
light
hard
water
and
an
unfortunate
kiss
of
skunk
which
luckily
doesnt
hold
too
much
sway
here
the
taste
cuts
out
the
skunk
and
ramps
up
the
fruit
but
beyond
that
maintains
the
smells
characteristics
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
slick
feel
overall
not
a
bad
american
kolsch
by
any
means
but
its
not
something
ill
likely
revisit
any
time
soon
this
is
the
best
americanmade
kölschstyle
beers
ive
tried
so
far
and
i
try
kölsches
whenever
i
can
the
body
just
a
hair
heavy
for
the
style
but
the
malthop
balance
is
almost
perfect
i
dabble
in
and
brew
many
beers
and
styles
but
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
buy
regularly
this
is
so
stupid
son
o
as
i
drink
im
staring
at
an
83
for
the
ba
score
wtf
are
yall
mad
this
is
at
least
an
8790
delicious
i
know
theres
no
glossy
500
ibu
sticker
on
the
bottle
and
no
boast
of
20
different
kinds
of
hops
grown
by
elves
in
the
forests
of
middle
earth
using
only
organic
growing
techniques
but
this
is
a
nice
brew
nonetheless
for
those
that
appreciate
the
style
i
think
this
is
a
good
choice
from
a
bottled
and
poured
into
a
stemmed
pilsner
glass
nice
fine
white
foam
head
of
1
14
inch
or
so
with
pale
ambermedium
yellow
color
and
slight
bubbles
in
the
carbonation
aroma
of
very
faint
citrus
hop
some
yeast
also
smells
like
it
would
be
sweet
so
that
might
be
some
maltness
too
but
faint
tastes
crisp
and
light
slight
citrus
tang
and
finish
very
refreshing
some
hop
bitterness
but
blends
very
well
with
the
yeast
and
overall
smoothness
is
excellent
i
need
to
get
one
of
my
faves
reissdorf
to
compare
overall
im
not
sure
how
it
compares
to
a
canonical
kolsch
but
it
is
drinkable
a
very
drinkable
smooth
crisp
springsummer
brew
with
plenty
of
flavor
overall
a
tasty
and
quaffable
kolsch
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
buttery
notes
with
light
cereal
notes
also
discernible
taste
is
also
dominated
by
unrefined
grainy
notes
with
light
buttery
aftertaste
body
is
about
average
with
medium
carbonation
definitely
not
as
good
as
most
example
of
the
style
a
decent
kolsch
and
worth
getting
every
once
and
while
the
fact
that
its
commercially
available
year
round
is
a
good
thing
the
beer
is
nothing
really
super
special
but
more
of
a
casual
session
beer
for
a
warm
day
overall
its
refreshing
dry
and
quite
drinkable
drinkability
some
wrote
more
of
a
blonde
summer
ale
true
but
it
has
that
koln
yeast
and
smell
so
i
am
calling
it
american
kolsch
a
great
style
pours
clear
gold
lighter
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
some
residual
white
foam
straw
malt
nose
some
pils
smell
clean
crisp
taste
light
lemon
in
the
end
good
firm
carbonation
contributes
to
the
flavor
some
fruitiness
nice
blend
good
style
o
a
nice
egalitarian
german
style
beer
but
one
that
is
too
characterized
by
its
funk
and
grape
notes
and
not
enough
by
its
hops
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
worth
the
drink
making
the
schlafly
kölsch
a
nice
beer
for
a
summer
or
fall
afternoon
rich
golden
in
color
and
it
is
pretty
hazy
in
appearance
a
minimal
layer
of
foam
rests
on
top
i
smell
that
distinct
kolsch
yeast
in
the
nose
which
almost
has
a
honey
like
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
smooth
thers
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
perhaps
citrus
in
the
flavor
a
smooth
refreshing
summer
beer
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
good
representation
of
the
style
shame
i
only
bought
one
of
these
as
this
has
session
written
all
over
it
while
a
kolsch
isnt
a
style
that
most
people
envision
for
the
warmer
months
this
would
be
great
to
have
a
nice
summer
day
when
something
lighter
and
watereddown
just
wont
cut
it
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
the
fact
that
this
came
from
the
middle
of
america
only
adds
to
the
appeal
and
likability
of
this
beer
nice
job
by
schlafly
on
this
one
i
was
let
down
by
schlaflys
hefeweizen
so
i
didnt
have
great
expectations
for
this
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
refreshment
and
good
flavor
of
this
great
summer
beer
this
really
hits
the
traditional
kolsch
extremely
well
though
i
havent
really
hard
many
american
attempts
at
the
beer
but
this
is
up
there
with
the
brews
that
ive
had
in
cologne
a
bit
stronger
on
the
bitterness
and
less
sweet
than
the
others
but
very
very
nice
overall
far
from
perfect
i
still
like
dundees
and
samuel
adams
version
better
its
still
very
delicious
can
i
have
another
please
this
was
my
first
kölsch
i
wish
i
could
try
an
import
but
this
company
seems
to
have
a
pretty
good
reputation
so
without
hesitation
i
bought
a
sixer
i
recently
made
a
kölsch
but
had
intended
to
try
one
before
making
it
in
any
case
i
couldnt
find
it
locally
and
my
wife
was
in
st
louis
where
its
made
and
had
one
for
me
by
proxy
she
raved
i
bought
the
ingredients
and
when
she
got
home
we
cooked
up
a
5gallon
batch
its
still
fermenting
on
its
second
week
and
i
can
only
dream
of
making
such
a
nice
brew
its
happened
before
so
im
still
dreaming
we
found
the
beer
at
the
local
liquor
store
and
they
remembered
us
from
when
we
asked
for
it
6weeks
ago
and
were
proud
to
deal
it
up
from
the
icebox
for
us
it
would
be
difficult
to
compete
with
this
subtle
light
luxury
lawnmower
brew
i
was
going
to
bring
the
rest
to
my
fatherinlaws
this
weekend
but
i
may
just
go
buy
them
their
own
sixer
no
sense
in
bringing
them
just
three
beers
ill
bring
them
the
other
goose
island
summertime
kölsch
and
will
rate
it
in
a
few
days
go
try
this
beer
if
you
can
find
it
sweet
graininess
faint
flash
of
fruit
light
body
moderate
carbonation
clean
tasty
and
easy
drinking
really
nice
actually
and
embodies
the
style
pretty
well
clean
crisp
and
grainy
with
faint
underlying
fruity
notes
super
easy
to
suck
down
used
the
closest
thing
to
a
cylindrical
stage
glass
i
could
find
for
this
tasting
pours
to
a
generous
white
foamy
head
and
golden
yellow
color
lacing
is
moderate
aroma
is
grainy
biscuity
and
has
a
nice
touch
of
noble
hops
and
white
grape
flavor
starts
with
a
rush
of
sweet
grains
with
a
following
balance
of
spicy
hops
and
a
sweet
white
wine
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
but
sticky
good
co2
i
like
this
kolsch
it
has
the
ale
nose
and
the
lager
finish
and
the
vinous
quality
that
is
the
signature
of
the
style
if
the
flavor
or
the
nose
does
not
have
that
white
grape
note
it
isnt
a
kolsch
the
beer
is
golden
yellow
and
clear
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
offers
lager
yeast
fruity
esters
grain
light
and
refreshing
malty
with
some
subtle
earthy
notes
a
tad
sweet
initially
with
some
sweet
notes
mid
to
late
palate
mild
hop
presence
refreshing
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
hit
the
spot
o
i
like
this
one
as
simple
refreshment
on
a
hot
day
it
even
has
a
modicum
of
substance
to
it
allowing
it
to
escape
the
pratfall
of
mindlessness
many
brews
of
its
ilk
fall
prey
to
o
enjoyable
beer
but
nothing
that
makes
it
too
different
faint
sweetness
light
white
grape
note
when
first
opened
slips
away
quickly
minerals
wheat
and
simple
grains
light
bodied
with
a
simple
lager
feel
slight
ale
yeast
complexity
a
good
refreshing
simple
beer
though
i
prefer
local
favorite
krankshaft
o
i
dug
it
and
i
dig
schlaflys
class
act
overall
i
like
it
as
a
refreshing
spring
beer
low
abv
is
good
too
the
beer
pours
a
clear
24
karat
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
barely
hangs
on
while
drinking
the
nose
is
relatively
neutral
nondistinct
flavors
drinkable
fizzy
lagerlike
beer
there
is
a
mild
honey
aftertaste
but
it
may
just
be
my
imagination
the
mouhfeel
is
light
bodied
semisweet
and
drinkable
this
is
not
a
beer
id
try
again
in
the
future
unless
only
bud
products
were
available
on
tap
basically
the
case
the
st
louis
airport
although
i
got
a
5
shot
of
woodford
reserve
with
my
beer
purchase
o
a
nice
session
beer
nothing
overwhelming
here
in
any
area
i
could
see
my
self
buying
these
on
a
nice
summer
day
o
a
very
refreshing
beer
simple
but
tasty
a
style
i
always
enjoy
but
dont
see
nearly
enough
of
unfortunately
this
beer
isnt
close
to
being
representative
of
the
kolsch
style
its
not
as
nutty
and
dry
as
is
representative
of
this
style
of
beer
the
beer
im
drinking
also
has
significant
hints
of
dicetyl
taste
and
nose
that
are
far
too
butterscotch
tasting
and
smelling
for
kolsch
it
could
just
be
the
six
pack
i
purchased
i
would
try
it
again
on
tap
the
finish
wasnt
quite
dry
enough
to
beat
out
the
german
kolsches
overall
for
the
price
a
great
american
kolsch
far
more
accesible
than
german
kolsches
and
certainly
fresher
in
the
us
overall
nice
basic
kolsch
a
little
drier
than
i
would
like
a
nice
start
to
the
flight
oa
decent
beer
very
light
could
use
some
more
flavor
but
a
good
lawnmowing
brew
overall
not
an
extremely
complicated
beer
but
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
a
great
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
something
i
would
buy
all
the
time
throughout
the
summer
im
still
not
sold
on
the
style
but
i
liked
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
with
the
low
alcohol
almost
a
sessionable
beer
that
you
can
throw
back
several
of
during
a
game
overall
very
satisfying
beer
an
easy
drinking
summer
brew
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
great
for
the
summer
this
is
a
fine
lightbodied
quaffable
ale
in
the
kolsch
tradition
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
schlafly
i
notice
lots
of
folks
have
graded
this
brew
as
somewhat
mediocre
i
could
not
agree
less
schafleys
kölsch
is
right
on
the
target
stylistically
and
a
fresh
refreshing
superior
example
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
this
beer
today
and
i
intend
to
do
so
again
and
again
overall
a
very
satisfying
brew
especially
given
the
near
100
degree
weather
were
having
this
memorial
day
weekend
i
would
happily
buy
this
again
especially
if
i
could
find
it
really
fresh
do
this
golden
ale
strives
to
faithfully
represent
the
kolsch
style
with
scattered
successes
the
malt
bill
is
metered
and
appropriate
yet
flavors
become
confused
early
on
as
tasted
acidity
runs
amok
still
the
tart
qualities
are
not
wildly
outofplace
in
such
a
light
beer
actually
helping
it
to
be
more
refreshing
than
the
textures
alone
would
accomplish
as
we
all
know
this
style
originates
from
the
ancient
german
city
of
cologne
or
koln
it
is
a
complex
hybrid
that
can
only
be
brewed
by
a
talented
brewer
many
try
many
fail
schlafly
succeeds
this
is
one
exemplary
renditions
of
the
style
at
least
as
far
as
any
american
brewery
is
concerned
auf
weidersehen
overall
a
tasty
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
well
suited
for
the
warmer
weather
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
toned
down
bottle
of
victorys
prima
pils
not
to
dry
or
bitter
not
to
fruity
but
packed
full
of
mild
hop
flavors
that
will
make
you
crack
open
another
on
a
hot
summer
day
high
carbonation
make
the
flavors
dance
in
your
mouth
with
very
little
or
no
after
taste
the
colder
the
better
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
very
smooth
while
still
offering
plenty
of
flavor
very
nice
kolsch
here
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
i
like
the
yeasty
presence
and
light
grains
that
dry
out
nicely
on
the
finish
kiss
of
noble
hops
to
give
it
some
grassy
sharpness
at
the
end
very
drinkable
although
i
could
enjoy
this
in
cold
weather
as
well
as
warm
stellar
beer
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
and
usually
go
through
a
six
pack
at
minimum
every
summer
smells
good
flavor
a
little
flat
hops
a
little
too
dominant
for
the
style
doesnt
allow
the
malt
to
shine
through
o
its
nice
and
drinkable
but
probably
better
with
some
food
by
itself
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
unpleasant
and
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
maltiness
id
prefer
it
a
little
lighter
and
a
cleaner
finish
but
this
isnt
too
damn
bad
d
oh
so
very
high
this
is
a
very
clean
and
light
beer
that
craft
and
non
craft
drinkers
alike
could
enjoy
its
a
great
beer
to
take
to
your
hammock
and
relax
on
a
summer
or
early
autumn
afternoon
if
only
schlafly
was
carried
down
south
the
aroma
was
rather
light
touches
of
caramel
malts
light
bready
tones
and
a
hint
of
banana
were
all
that
were
readily
noticeable
not
bad
really
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
of
a
pop
in
it
though
if
i
am
being
honest
the
flavor
was
very
nice
though
rich
notes
of
biscuit
and
bready
malts
layered
on
top
of
a
light
fruity
spike
of
flavor
some
nice
touches
of
grain
coming
through
mid
palate
before
dropping
back
into
a
smooth
and
subtle
feel
crisp
and
clean
finish
very
drinkable
will
be
my
new
goto
kolsch
from
now
on
o
a
good
beer
for
the
style
i
could
see
this
being
perfect
for
outdoor
events
on
a
sunny
day
its
easy
drinking
also
nice
and
refreshing
o
this
was
my
first
offering
from
schlafly
and
it
was
a
nice
relief
to
have
this
hot
summer
a
creamy
light
refreshing
kolsch
pours
a
clear
gold
with
one
fingers
worth
of
white
foam
with
good
retention
aromas
are
pleasantly
grainy
and
grassy
but
not
much
else
flavors
are
simple
but
perfectly
balanced
grain
flavors
are
most
apparent
on
the
front
and
midpalates
before
lemony
hops
finish
it
out
everything
about
this
beer
is
straightforward
there
are
no
harsh
edges
to
be
negotiated
and
the
overall
effect
is
quite
refreshing
all
of
this
is
consistent
with
the
worlds
better
kolsches
if
id
judged
this
by
its
cover
id
have
been
suspicious
id
picked
up
a
dud
good
thing
i
didnt
because
this
is
actually
a
damn
nice
casual
brew
this
is
a
well
crafted
kolsch
no
reason
to
try
any
other
in
this
style
too
bad
its
only
a
summer
seasonal
for
schlafly
thats
the
only
negative
o
drink
it
fast
and
drink
it
fun
not
much
more
to
say
other
than
it
is
a
good
example
of
a
kolsch
beer
its
definitely
a
solid
summer
beer
with
enough
flavor
and
body
to
satisfy
a
good
effort
on
a
rather
unexciting
style
poured
this
kolsch
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
gold
color
it
produces
a
nice
thick
white
creamy
head
head
retention
is
excellent
and
lacing
is
average
the
aroma
has
a
nice
base
of
grain
and
there
is
some
slight
citrus
notes
and
suggestions
of
butternut
squash
the
taste
of
this
ale
brings
to
mind
fresh
baked
bread
lemon
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
body
is
medium
decent
example
of
the
style
excellent
session
beer
outstanding
gateway
beer
something
a
bud
light
drinker
would
enjoy
o
a
nice
example
of
the
style
quite
refreshing
and
perfect
for
a
warm
day
schlafly
has
just
started
distributing
in
iowa
this
week
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
the
kolsch
style
is
one
of
my
favorites
for
hot
summer
weather
schlafly
does
a
nice
job
keeping
this
beer
quite
straightforward
and
true
to
style
lively
carbonation
bright
clean
malt
flavor
moderate
hopping
with
a
touch
of
citric
acidity
great
session
beer
here
what
starts
out
fairly
disappointing
in
appearance
and
smell
finishes
rather
strong
in
taste
and
feel
id
get
this
again
o
an
above
average
kolsch
and
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
humid
summer
day
o
schlafly
kolsch
is
one
of
the
best
kolschstyle
brews
ive
had
in
a
while
they
manage
to
balance
crispness
and
creaminess
expertly
and
provide
a
really
satisfying
lowabv
brew
that
is
great
for
summer
an
above
average
kolsch
from
st
louis
own
schlaflys
their
brews
are
pretty
sessionable
and
this
one
is
no
exception
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
big
white
head
smells
of
light
pilsner
malt
taste
is
sweet
grassyness
up
front
with
a
sweet
bready
middle
and
a
lemony
clean
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
low
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
and
the
low
alcohol
is
a
plus
this
pours
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
sudsy
white
head
there
is
very
little
retention
or
lacy
but
i
wasnt
expecting
any
from
this
style
its
very
clean
and
refreshing
i
hate
to
say
it
but
the
smell
is
like
a
bmc
it
kinda
has
that
dirtysweet
pilsner
taste
but
this
is
still
a
craft
beer
quality
beverage
i
can
taste
malt
and
hops
and
this
is
overall
refreshing
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
bitter
and
a
little
less
sweet
but
im
not
going
to
split
hairs
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
good
bottled
with
love
on

pale
but
bright
yellow
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
impressive
dense
head
of
foam
with
excellent
staying
power
light
malty
aroma
with

very
clean
and
refreshing
a
great
summer
ale
o
really
refreshing
not
a
qhole
lot
of
complex
flavors
going
on
but
i
guess
for
the
style
it
is
really
nice
overall
this
is
really
nice
for
a
kolsch
certainly
drinkable
well
done
overall
this
is
a
great
solid
kolsch
kind
of
ambushes
you
a
bit
i
like
that
o
while
not
as
good
as
the
german
varieties
i
have
had
but
this
could
simply
be
the
difference
between
the
bottle
and
the
tap
i
do
remember
fruh
in
my
mind
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
being
much
much
better
from
the
tap
but
i
dont
think
i
will
get
to
experience
this
beer
that
way
if
i
do
i
will
be
sure
to
review
again
aside
from
that
small
shortfall
a
very
nice
rendition
of
this
quite
rare
style
at
least
on
this
side
of
the
pond
will
happily
find
and
drink
this
one
again
taste
is
mild
but
with
a
little
hoppy
zing
overall
this
is
a
light
and
enjoyable
session
kolsch
not
outstanding
but
solid
enough
a
fine
beer
one
could
have
a
few
of
not
my
preferred
style
but
not
upset
verdict
probably
very
well
priced
and
therefore
drinkable
to
the
nines
but
not
something
special
this
has
a
light
refreshing
flavor
that
makes
it
a
great
summer
beer
the
bottle
i
had
was
made
in
december
so
i
wonder
what
it
is
doing
in
winter
i
only
think
that
it
is
popular
enough
to
brew
year
round
but
it
is
better
to
wait
till
summer
clarity
and
color
are
good
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
in
the
kolsh
category
could
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
newer
craft
drinkers
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
among
my
favorite
of
the
style
overallnotes
one
of
the
multiple
beers
i
had
that
night
i
started
here
and
worked
my
way
through
the
list
good
way
to
start
the
evening
fun
night
overall
and
with
good
beer
to
boot
worth
trying
if
you
find
yourself
at
the
tap
room
d
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
drinkable
and
well
made
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
but
notched
up
cereal
grains
nice
faint
citrus
noticeablenoble
hops
but
not
overdone
at
all
saaz
great
warm
weather
beer
extremely
drinkable
with
a
very
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
above
average
level
of
carbonation
is
suitable
for
this
brew
pours
a
relatively
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
nose
is
really
quite
faint
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
fruit
but
mostly
dry
grain
the
taste
is
some
light
straw
and
grain
along
with
mild
stone
fruits
and
some
light
citrus
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
well
carbonated
leading
to
a
nice
easy
drinkability
factor
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
medium
bitterness
golden
straw
colored
seem
to
loose
the
head
early
but
probably
do
to
my
bad
pouring
good
middle
of
the
road
beer
to
keep
on
hand
for
those
friends
who
do
not
care
much
for
craft
beers
highly
recommend
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
its
aroma
has
hints
of
lemon
vanilla
resin
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
wwell
balanced
between
ginger
banana
pine
and
bread
notes
it
leaves
a
pleasant
gingerlike
aftertaste
schlafly
kolsch
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
leading
to
a
fairly
high
drinkability
it
is
very
refreshing
and
went
well
with
grilled
cheese
sandwiches
recommended
certainly
lighter
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
picked
up
while
st
louis
for
a
wedding
as
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
overall
a
really
nice
refreshing
summer
ale
that
seems
to
fit
well
into
the
kolsch
style
refreshing
good
effort
overall
though
d
crazy
drinkable
i
could
session
this
all
night
both
from
a
flavor
and
abv
standpoint
well
done
schlafly
i
had
this
in
a
22oz
glass
on
tap
at
a
bar
while
watching
the
bears
game
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
slightly
sweet
the
color
was
pale
and
the
taste
hoppy
having
lived
in
france
and
traveled
in
germany
i
can
say
that
this
attempt
at
a
kölsch
beer
is
spot
on
mouth
feel
wise
this
is
a
thirst
quencher
it
is
crisp
clean
prickly
with
carbonation
and
leaves
the
palate
wet
this
is
a
great
interpretation
of
the
german
style
drinkability
while
it
received
pretty
good
scores
and
i
stated
that
it
was
really
quite
alright
im
still
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
that
does
hurt
the
drinkability
a
little
bit
i
would
definitely
take
it
over
a
macro
any
day
and
this
is
a
fine
summer
beer
i
enjoy
drinking
kolschs
as
im
cooking
dinner
or
grilling
outside
its
very
refreshing
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
which
means
that
youre
ready
for
a
meal
or
a
different
beer
right
away
this
is
really
nicely
done
an
easy
drinking
kolsch
well
suited
to
hot
midwestern
summers
the
palate
is
simple
a
little
dry
up
front
wets
in
the
middle
and
finishes
crisp
and
resfreshing
this
makes
for
a
superbly
drinkable
summer
ale
ive
never
had
a
kolsch
before
but
it
was
the
guest
beer
at
my
local
brewpub
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
chance
the
color
is
a
very
transparent
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
very
effervescent
with
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
the
taste
is
light
and
clean
with
a
ssweet
yeasty
aftertaste
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
and
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
never
had
a
kolsch
before
but
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
whirl
its
almost
like
a
cross
between
a
pale
ale
and
a
pilsner
its
transparent
and
lemon
yellow
in
color
and
pours
a
thin
layer
of
white
head
which
recedes
quickly
yet
leaves
a
nice
creamy
lacing
also
lots
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
to
the
top
smell
is
fruity
and
a
bit
musty
from
the
yeast
flavor
is
sweet
upfront
with
just
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
well
balanced
and
nothing
really
dominates
yeasts
are
detectable
in
the
back
and
well
into
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
and
crisp
mouthfeel
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
semidry
finish
it
wouldnt
be
too
hard
to
slam
a
few
of
these
down
in
a
short
period
not
sure
how
it
compares
to
others
within
the
style
but
its
not
too
bad
i
got
this
one
in
a
sampler
pack
and
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
by
itself
but
its
alright
for
something
a
little
different
the
cleanliness
of
this
beer
is
wonderful
there
is
no
aftertaste
that
i
usually
associate
with
this
style
its
nice
and
mildly
sweet
up
front
some
bitterness
in
the
back
from
the
grains
but
overall
its
well
connected
and
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
from
the
carbonation
i
could
session
this
thing
all
night
long
the
beer
is
a
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
the
smell
is
lemony
and
herbal
the
taste
is
slightly
lemony
and
crisp
it
has
a
light
body
with
a
dry
finish
and
is
very
refreshing
the
beer
was
much
better
than
i
expected
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
satisfying
this
looks
like
a
good
summer
brew
or
anytime
actually
d
very
easy
definitely
a
session
beer
d
i
almost
didnt
buy
this
because
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
so
good
im
glad
i
did
this
beer
is
super
refreshing
and
when
summer
breaks
i
will
schedule
a
camping
trip
just
so
i
can
pack
a
case
of
these
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
is
decent
lacing
is
good
aroma
is
grain
grapes
green
apples
lemon
and
some
floral
hops
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
grainy
and
lemon
flavors
being
the
strongest
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
crisp
and
clean
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
this
is
a
decent
overall
brew
and
not
a
bad
choice
as
a
session
beer
nice
clear
golden
color
just
slightly
darker
than
a
lager
poured
with
a
nice
head
not
much
of
an
aroma
although
i
do
detect
a
little
citrus
very
similar
nose
feel
to
a
lager
with
malt
and
hop
subleties
pulling
through
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
slight
hoppy
citrus
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
im
used
to
and
maybe
a
bit
watery
but
is
perfect
for
warmer
weather
when
youre
looking
for
a
good
smooth
refreshing
flavorful
beer
seems
slightly
undercarbonated
to
me
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
saying
its
flat
but
that
doesnt
ruin
its
appeal
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
see
myself
easily
throwing
back
several
of
these
with
no
problem
d
very
high
drinkability
very
enjoyable
light
and
mildly
carbonated
making
it
an
easy
drink
ddont
see
any
reason
why
i
would
ever
buy
this
beer
again
there
are
way
to
many
refreshing
beers
that
have
far
more
to
offer
a
nice
clear
straw
yellow
with
about
1
finger
of
white
head
on
top
smell
is
of
muscat
grapes
and
some
citrus
a
nice
crisp
flavor
to
it
with
more
of
that
muscat
taste
some
bread
malt
and
lemon
zest
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
that
is
quite
refreshing
not
as
dry
in
the
finish
as
i
would
have
liked
however
drinkability
is
good
goes
down
smooth
and
is
real
easy
to
drink
overall
a
solid
well
crafted
beer
in
my
opinion
in
general
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
thin
white
bubbly
head
head
receded
rapidly
on
this
beer
leaving
spotty
lacing
behind
nose
is
grainy
some
malts
and
a
hint
of
lemon
taste
is
grains
and
grassiness
up
front
moving
in
to
a
light
but
definitive
malt
bodied
in
the
finish
there
is
a
touch
of
lemon
and
pepper
light
to
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
there
is
a
clean
crisp
taste
to
this
beer
if
only
schalfy
distributed
to
ma
this
would
for
sure
be
my
summertime
beer
an
easydrinking
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
months
d
my
only
complaint
about
this
kolsch
is
the
metalic
tinge
to
it
other
than
that
this
has
been
a
very
good
tasting
kolsch
not
my
favorite
style
by
far
but
this
was
enjoyable
a
great
addition
to
a
hot
summer
day
conclusion
all
in
all
a
pretty
nice
summer
beer
its
clean
lightly
fruity
and
a
bit
grassyhaylike
its
a
bit
sweet
in
my
book
but
not
bad
malty
aroma
with
very
little
hops
brilliantly
clear
pale
gold
color
no
head
present
good
malt
with
biscuit
like
quality
light
mouthfeel
with
mild
earthy
hop
bitterness
finishes
clean
with
some
residual
malt
flavor
very
light
and
tasty
a
good
summer
session
beer
a
highly
recommended
summer
beer
im
not
sure
this
beer
does
anything
exceptionally
well
but
then
for
a
summer
thirst
quencher
its
superb
since
most
lighter
beers
do
falter
i
consider
this
to
be
a
very
fine
example
indeed
seek
this
out
in
the
hot
months
if
you
can
get
it
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
and
one
i
would
have
again
worth
a
shot
edit
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
less
flaws
i
find
with
it
and
i
find
it
to
be
exactly
what
the
brewers
were
going
for
dry
with
a
wine
like
palate
with
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
one
ill
definitely
be
coming
back
to
in
the
near
future
till
then
the
review
must
stand
i
guess
i
will
pick
up
a
sixer
after
all
theres
one
for
drinkability
intriguing
not
a
bad
brew
probably
my
first
kolsch
but
who
knows
drinkability
is
perfefect
for
the
summer
i
think
the
germans
own
the
summer
brews
light
and
poundable
bottle
from
sean9689
as
part
of
a
dld
trade
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
color
very
clear
with
a
thick
slab
of
rocky
foam
that
laces
onto
the
glass
the
aroma
is
subdued
but
spot
on
unassuming
malt
with
some
grass
or
musky
funk
the
taste
is
classic
kolsch
balanced
between
lightly
toasted
malt
and
grassy
hops
very
well
done
this
is
my
style
for
sessioning
and
cream
taste
is
good

what

there
is

this

overall
a
solid
offering
from

this
is
a
kolsch
whatever
it
was
a
nice
lighter
ringwood
beer
where
was
a
sweet
light
caramel
malt
covered
in
ringwood
fruit
and
cream
almost
like
a
fruit
dip
and
finished
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
not
your
average
summer
ale
but
a
somewhat
average
ringwood
beer
still
quite
drinkable
and
a
nice
brew
on
a

eve
overall
a
refreshing
and
easy
beer
to
through
back
i
enjoyed
a
few
of
these
sitting
on
a
dock
on
badger
island
me
overall
a
pretty
lackluster
beer
from
a
brewery
that
rarely
wows
me
this
is
a
half
decent
summer
ale
but
not
worth
seeking
out
a
bit
boring
overall
and
also
a
rather
boring
kolsch
not
bad
really
just
not
very
good
recommended

me
da
this
could
be
a

favorite
well
well
its
not
a
kolsch
but
not
all
beers
fit
neatly
into
a
category
to
me
more
like
an
english
ale
buttery
and
i
think
i
detected
ringwood
yeast
as
for
a
summer
ale
well
i
dont
know
it
has
more
to
it
than
a
typical
summer
ale
a
good
thing
though
pretty
easy
drink
and
has
a
refreshing
quality
but
be
ready
to
encounter
plenty
of
diacytel
unexpected
for
stylesummer
ale
in
the
end
a
decent
brew
but
too
high
of
an
abv
and
buttery
to
make
it
a
summer
session
a
good
flavor
here
not
the
average
summer
brew
mouthfeel
is
totally
full
bodied
the
carbonation
is
abundant
which
is
probably
right
for
style
but
otherwise
man
this
has
some
good
mouthfeel
qualities
onpar
with
a
bigbeer
overall
this
is
not
one
ill
return
to
for
a
sixer
but
it
is
truly
a
fine
beerjust
not
my
style
i
suppose
i
actually
dont
enjoy
most
summer
brews
but
this
breaks
the
mold
as
it
is
not
weak
flavorless
booring
macrolike
or
a
bad
wheat
beer
as
i
find
is
typical
its
exactly
the
opposite
flavorful
interesting
all
the
gearys
beer
i
try
really
give
me
the
sensation
that
the
recipe
was
painstakingly
and
carefully
hand
crafted
for
all
the
right
elements
measured
above
try
this
drinkability
this
was
my
summer
beer
and
boasts
a
nice
drinkability
for
a
6

one
of
those

why
ill
always

the

satiating
it
ends
in
a
dryly

of

but
the
mouthfeel
gets
weird
like
its
physically
affecting
my

by
scorching
it
with
a

similiar
to
sour
candy
weird
regardless
this
is
quite
well

for

slick
coating
on

distinct

aftertaste
a
very
pleasant
nice
drinking
beer
not
quite
what
i
would
want
in
the
summer
but
in
the
autumn
it
was
great
overall
not
all
that
impressive
not
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
its
a
sweet
beer
actually
and
heavy
for
the
style
hop
flavor
is
notable
but
bthe
bitterness
is
nothing
to
mention
its
a
tasty
beer
a
little
out
of
character
for
true
style
not
as
refreshing
as
most
kolschs
but
more
flavorful
than
most
a
flawed
version
of
the
style
a
little
over
the
top
in
terms
of
flavor
and
abv
but
unique
to
say
the
least
d
highly
drinkable
and
definately
recommended
great
summer
beer
the
6
00
abv
can
hardly
be
felt
here
and
it
still
amazes
me
how
high
it
is
since
ive
never
had
a
kolsch
before
im
not
sure
how
close
to
the
real
thing
this
is
nevertheless
i
enjoyed
tasting
this
and
having
something
better
than
the
semimindless
watered
down
beers
that
tend
to
characterize
the
summer
season
not
great
for
an
introduction
or
for
someone
looking
to
stay
within
the
norms
but
for
those
willing
to
step
outside
their
bounds
a
bit
this
beer
would
prove
to
be
quite
rewarding

may
not
go
out

but
if
its
there
will
drink
it
overall
a
great
looking
ale
that
kinda
went
downhill
from
there
not

just
rather
uneventful
for
me
still
a
great
brewery
and
a
quality
product
for
sure
just
not
my
thang
still
love
the
ne
a
nice
summer
brew
quite
refreshing
not
quite
a
kolsch
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
perfect
refreshing
beer
for
people
who
are
still
concerned
with
the
taste
and
overall
quality
of
their
beverage
to
produce
any
head
one
must
pour
rather
vigorously
the
beer
is
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
steady
mesmerizing
carbonation
it
smells
crisp
and
faintly
sweet
and
fruity
the
taste
is
well
balanced
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
play
on
the
initial
sweetness
which
is
reminiscent
of
caramels
feels
clean
and
light
in
the
mouth
overall
a
very
drinkable
beverage
ive
had
this
before
and
it
has
yet
to
let
me
down
bought
it
this
time
because
i
wanted
something
lighter
but
no
less
delicious
finally
props
to
liza
kelley
for
the
design
on
the
bottle
and
packaging
happily
drunk
but
my
search
for
a
standby
summer
brew
on
the
east
coast
to
replace
sams
summer
continues
d
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
i
could
see
going
through
a
six
pack
very
quickly
really
solid
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
drinkability
one
of
the
better
domestic
versions
of
the
style
ive
ever
had
lots
of
everything
and
lots
of
flavor
definitely
a
summer
brew
too
i
could
certainly
a
6pack
of
this
around
a
grill
and
on
the
dock
sometime
this
summer
mouth
feel
is
very
light
and
actively
carbonated
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
smallish
head
the
smell
is
malty
with
some
floral
and
hop
aromas
the
taste
is
very
maltynutty
with
a
bitter
hop
aftertaste
this
is
ok
but
nothing
special
the
mf
is
light
with
the
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hops
clashing
that
makes
a
beer
that
can
be
tough
to
drink
this
is
okbut
buy
a
different
summer
and
youll
be
better
off
drinkability
a
somewhat
unorthodox
boosted
kolsch
but
still
pretty
easily
drinkable
the
drinkability
is
somewhat
off
for
a
kolsch
though
as
the
clean
crispness
usually
associated
with
the
style
is
negatively
affected
by
the
caramel
malt
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
to
me
calling
it
a
summer
beer
is
not
quite
right
because
many
summer
beers
are
pallid
insipid
wimpy
little
things
and
this
beer
could
stand
on
its
own
at
any
time
during
the
year
crisp
and
biscuity
just
slightly
sour
but
also
smooth
it
has
moderate
heft
and
the
ability
to
go
from
ice
cold
to
warm
without
losing
attractiveness
its
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
makes
me
slink
toward
the
fridge
for
another
drinkability
is
topnotch
gearys
offerings
are
my
everyday
beers
slightly
above
average
good
serviceable
beers
this
years
summer
offering
has
a
striking
green
label
part
of
gearys
art
contest
with
a
green
cap
it
poured
a
clear
orange
with
a
medium
head
that
quickly
dissipated
it
had
a
pleasant
floralcitrus
odor
and
a
citrusy
taste
that
was
nicely
hopped
i
think
its
a
little
more
assertive
than
most
summer
brews
and
very
enjoyable
drinkability
pretty
good
light
and
refreshing
not
a
power
beer
thats
for
sure
but
an
ok
choice
for
a
session
a
very
sustainable
refreshment
in
the
hot
summer
heat
but
dont
expect
much
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
more
character
picked
this
up
in
a
gearys
mix
pack
the
other
day
found
all
sorts
of
surprises
in
it
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
as
i
was
pouring
the
aroma
poured
out
as
well
had
kind
of
a

caramel
with
malts
laying
on

very
pleseant
nice
golden
hue

no

when
poured
good

sweet
at
first
it
grabs
your
taste
buds
with
the

then
slowly
mixing
with
the
malts
this
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
the
taste
does
not
stay
for
long
good
flavorful
brew
not
your
average
summer
ales
a
little
bit
more
malty
honey
colored
and
filtered
with
a
thin
head
that
is
persistent
and
lacing
that
slid
slowly
down
the
side
of
the
glass
back
into
the
brew
dry
smell
that
is
almost
winevinegary
but
with
a
bitter
tone
and
buttery
notes
almost
a
hint
of
faintest
glenmorangie
dry
taste
as
well
tonic
water
tinge
on
tip
of
tongue
with
buttery
notes
and
sweet
white
grape
then
hops
dropped
on
malt
with
a
wholesome
bitterness
maybe
some
woodiness
somewhere
in
there
too
clean
lasting
echo
of
a
finish
could
be
a
bit
fuller
bodied
but
there
is
a
wonderful
spiciness
to
the
mouthfeel
that
persists
with
the
flavors
finish
serious
summer
brew
but
not
that
typical
light
seasonal
stuff
if
thats
what
youre

not
as
refreshing
as
a

beer
might

maybe
this
is
a
spring

this
one
would
be
fine
with
bbq
and
the
like
not
with
strongsharp
foods
a
solid

but
a
kölsch
it
is
not
at

by
todays

none

this
one
of
the
most
flavorful
summer
brews
this
year
amber
with
a

the

consists
of
caramel
maltiness
a
slight
nuttiness
with
a
sweet
juicy
fruity
almost
cotton
candy
aroma
very
like
harpoon
hibernian
ale
actually
but
with
a
little
more
complexity
the
taste
is
very
simlar
to
the
aroma
witha
nice
maltiness
backed
by
some
nutty
flavors
there
is
juicy
very
dry
fruity
favor
underneath
some
undefined
hop
bitterness
lies
beneath
medium
bodied
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
lends
to
a
lightness
that
this
brew
needs
to
be
a
summer
offering
average
drinkability
while
good
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
very
summery
but
hey
good
beer
is
good
beer
i
wasnt
looking
for
much
in
this
brew
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
real
find
it
pours
a
clear
goldenamber
color
the
head
is
white
although
fairly
thin
its
got
a
nice

aroma
bread
caramel
and
the
impression
sweetness
are
in
the
smell
with
a
little
hops
the
taste
is
solid
with
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
theres
a
little
butter
and
an
almost
honeylike
quality
in
the
flavors
finish
is
pretty
hoppy
and
after
a
few
sips
a
floral
and
almost
musty
hop
characteristic
comes
forth
medium
body
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
drinkable
extremely
enjoyable
brew
its
not
what
id
call
a
kolsch
but
it
sure
it
tasty
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
and
this
one
is
just
right
for
summer
though
i
am
unfortunately
drinking
it
on
a
crappy
rainy
late
may
evening
gearys
stuff
is
hard
to
find
around
here
but
im
keeping
an
eye
open
for
this
one
all
summer
long
crisp
clean
and
very
yummy
really
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
ive
had
i
know
its
a
tough
beer
to
describe
but
its
just
so
clean
its
sort
of
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
turned
down
a
notch
mixed
with
a
very
crisp
kolsch
or
even
american
hefe
i
could
drink
this
baby
all
summer
long
this
beer
is
pretty
average
id
come
to
expect
a
little
more
from
gearys
appears
a
very
clear
and
bubbly
straw
yellow
color
quickly
disappearing
head
smell
and
taste
are
pretty
bland
some
hop
spice
which
is
good
but
not
enough
to
keep
my
interest
and
theres
a
disagreeable
grainy
aftertaste
ill
try
it
again
but
my
first
impression
is
that
this
is
a
pretty
average
kolsch
overall
very
interesting
brew
i
like
it
a
lot
although
i
drink
the
drinkability
is
low
i
wouldnt
want
to
to
have
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
as
its
a
bit
much
to
take
in
geary
makes
some
pretty
unique
beers
overall
i
much
prefer
the
reissdorf
kolsch
to
gearys
summer
ale
as
a
kolsch
it
seems
to
be
loosely
defined
for
this
beer
the
art
work
on
the
bottle
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
but
then
again
its
whats
inside
that
counts
12
oz
with
no
freshness
date
was
in
the
store
so
long
the
sixpack
was
on
sale
for
2
99
pours
into
the
imperial
pint
glass
a
deep
orange
with
a
1
finger
offwhite
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
malt
sweetness
diacetyl
and
bubblegum
in
the
nose
flavors
are
the
same
with
hints
of
lemon
and
a
hop
spicinessbitterness
that
gets
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
being
a
summer
ale
i
was
expecting
some
spices
but
didnt
notice
any
flavors
are
blended
well
and
feels
good
on
the
palate
not
your
typical
summer
ale
tastes
like
a
belgian
crossed
with
the
troegenator
i
just
reviewed
nothing
like
the
kolsch
from
my
local
brewpub
but
delicious
nonetheless
held
its
own
when
paired
with
spicy
shrimp
creole
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
fairly
clear
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
just
a
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fairly
light
but
has
some
lemon
orange
and
grassy
aromas
to
it
just
a
light
pleasant
smell
the
taste
is
malty
at
first
with
grassy
flavors
coming
up
in
the
middle
under
the
pale
malt
background
there
is
some
lemon
and
piney
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
style
and
the
drinkability
is
wonderful
for

a
nice
summer
beer
gearys
summer
ale
2004
was
golden
in
color
capped
by
a
small
shortlived
head
the
aroma
had
a
mild
floral
bouquet
to
it
the
taste
was
a
flavorful
blend
of
hops
and
malt
that
was
mercifully
not
too
citrusy
like
many
other
summer
ales
there
was
a
good
bite
to
it
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
finish
was
a
little
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
that
i
wished
i
had
more
of
this
and
gumballhead
are
a
couple
of
summer
ales
that
im
finally
going
to
review
after
my
tastings
in
july
didnt
produce
results
that
i
felt
comfortable
posting
when
i
tried
gearys
summer
ale
in
july
i
thought
it
was
a
belgian
style
golden
ale
after
checking
their
website
im
convinced
that
it
is
indeed
based
on
a
kolsch
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
burnished
orange
body
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
subdued
with
some
sweetish
caramel
and
pale
malt
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
vague
tropical
fruits
mouthfeel
is
actively
carbonated
with
a
light
to
medium
body
taste
has
biscuity
malt
buttery
yeastringwood
and
a
bitter
hop
character
tettnang
and
saaz
hops
are
used
and
produce
some
floral
notes
but
very
little
of
the
fruitiness
that
i
noted
three
months
ago
the
finish
is
bitter
but
clean
im
convinced
now
that
this
is
not
belgian
inspired
but
its
an
odd
rendition
of
a
kolsch
actually
i
liked
this
better
three
months
ago
when
it
seemed
to
have
more
of
a
yeast
presence
along
with
some
belgian
inspired
tropical
fruitiness
this
one
was
difficult
to
review
on
both
occasions
but
its
drinkable
just
not
a
favorite
drinkability
its
got
some
nice
parts
to
it
but
it
comes
across
as
a
bitterized
belgian
not
the
best
combination
at
least
according
to
my
palate
with
so
many
flavor
aspects
this
would
be
an
interesting
beer
to
pair
up
with
different
foods
to
draw
out
the
different
tastes
nice
dark
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
this
offering
had
a
malty
fruity
and
hopy
aroma
very
nice
taste
was
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
light
ending
hop
presence
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
oily
and
this
affected
drinkability
i
wouldnt
beg
for
another
but
i
could
drink
another
if
offered
mouthfeel
light
yet
crisp
plenty
of
tiny
tickling
carbonation
drinkable
certainly
although
it
better
suits
a
hot
dry
night
than
a
cold
and
cloudy
one
as
tonight
this
poured
an
absolutely
lucid
orangey
gold
color
low
to
no
carbonation
thin
head
dissolved
away
quickly
the
aroma
has
a
somewhat
muddled
fruity
graininess
and
something
like
port
wine
the
taste
is
lemony
and
winey
pungent
fruits
tangy
and
bittersweet
that
carries
through
into
the
finish
on
the
whole
this
is
a
unique
and
strange
tasting
beer
bitter
citrus
sweet
and
winey
aftertaste
floral
and
perumey
i
enjoy
kolschbier
but
this
example
isnt
entirely
my
cup
o
tea
taste
is
grassy
and
fruity
bitter
crisp
malt
followed
by
light
hoppy
flavors
very
crisp
and
clean
very
light
nothing
very
complex
about
this
ale
but
it
is
pretty
tasty
and
a
cut
above
most
summer
beers
a
decent
attempt
at
a
kolsch
the
website
says
this
is
a
kolsch
but
the
description
on
the
site
reads
differently
the
flavor
is
similar
to
an
overhopped
kolsch
more
of
a
golden
ale
the
beer
is
not
very
refreshing
due
to
the
harshness
in
the
hop
bittering
and
flavors
pours
a
pale
hazy
stream
resulting
in
surpring
little
head
and
even
less
retention
and
lacing
the
malty
butter
caramel
flavor
was
quick
to
notice
as
was
the
alcohol
punch
a
good
summer
brew
one
of
the
only
local
brews
i
found
on
vacation
without
going
to
hannafords
nice
new
bottle
this
year
solid
light
cream
colored
head
clear
golden
colored
beer
with
streams
of
carbonation
light
caramel
malt
flavor
a
bit
of
butterscotch
and
a
mildly
bitter
finish
floral
hop
and
caramel
malt
aroma
light
bodied
not
the
smoothest
going
down
butterscotch
flavor
cuts
down
on
the
summer
drinkability
but
overall
a
decent
beer
chill
haze
pale
gold
color
somewhat
getting
close
to
an
amber
hue
but
not
nearly
enough
a
waffer
thin
white
cap
adorns
the
top
quickly
disappearing
to
leave
a
very
thin
collar
and
very
little
lacing
sticks
aroma
is
mild
and
a
bit
subdued
of
a
sweet
bready
maltyness
and
butter
with
a
small
hint
of
grassy
hops
taste
is
good
a
bit
sharp
of
hop
spice
and
carbonation
upon
first
notice
surrounding
it
quickly
is
a
nice
buttery
and
dulled
fruit
maltyness
malts
seem
to
have
the
leg
up
on
this
one
a
bit
bready
and
chewy
around
the
corners
yet
keeps
a
little
zip
of
yeast
grab
and
hop
spice
right
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
feel
is
about
medium
bodied
chewy
and
buttery
with
a
certain
carbonation
hold
but
theres
a
short
bit
of
emptyness
just
before
the
finish
malts
keep
it
interesting
and
the
front
and
middle
is
solid
sweet
with
a
certain
sharpness
and
crispness
quality
to
it
a
very
unique
amber
more
fruity
then
toasty
nearly
maibock
in
likeness
really
thanks
to
jason
for
the
bottle
a
hint
of
tart
lemon
with
a
dash
of
honey
rounds
things
out
overall
a
surprising
alcohol
punch
that
warms
the
insides
may
not
be
desired
during
the
summer
months
but
none
the
less
makes
this
beer
a
good
one
a
very
drinkable
but
bigger
beer
than
most
summer
selections
how
can
you
release
summer
beer
in
april
in
maine
all
and
all
its
another
average
summer
brew
light
to
medium
feel
very
smooth
good
but
not
great
a
different
take
on
the
summer
ale
stronger
than
most
the
beer
pours
a
darker
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awfully
plain
there
seems
to
be
some
pale
malts
and
a
mysterious
fruity
scent
the
taste
is
good
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
bit
of
lemony
flavor
it
is
a
different
taste
but
its
not
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
it
is
a
decent
drinker
ive
had
better
summer
ales
though
emeril
beer
kicks
the
concept
of
summer
ale
up
a
notch
richer
color
a
darker
tarnished
coppery
gold
brew
than
most
summer
ales
i
think
deeper
aromas
a
thick
doughy
cookielike
malt
backbone
is
smothered
in
floral
and
fruit
aromas
apple
with
a
citric
piney
twist
lovely
sweet
malt
flavors
great
big
balance
strong
hop
finish
that
brings
its
own
level
of
herbs
fruit
and
bitterness
not
your
standard
summer
ale
perhaps
should
be
a
standard
bbq
summer
ale
what
a
summer
beer
this
is
no
light
ale
or
lager
here
a
nice
deep
golden
rich
color
and
flavor
a
nice
creamy
head
to
this
beer
with
a
malty
and
fruity
with
a
hint
of
yeast
to
itflavor
is
a
big
malt
attack
in
the
start
with
nice
fruitiness
with
a
light
hop
profilea
bigger
tasting
beer
for
a
summer
but
not
heavy
a
great
beer
for
any
season
disgusting
this
brew
is
entirely
unpalatable
it
goes
down
the
sink
tastes
like
august
schells
or
leinenkugels
garbage
a
fine
summer
beer
offering
gearys
pours
out
to
a
bright
copper
color
in
the
glass
with
slight
head
aroma
is
that
of
light
citrus
and
faint
yeast
taste
is
very
good
with
some
wheat
presence
and
a
nice
slight
hop
taste
the
swallow
is
where
this
beer
shines
as
it
begs
for
another
sip
or
gulp
even
i
am
glad
this
is
being
distributed
in
michigan
it
offers
up
a
wonderful
alternative
to
bells
oberon
and
arcadias
whitsun
their
label
artwork
aside
but
you
got
to
check
it
out
anywayits
very
cool
that
they
support
the
budding
artists
in
maine
gearys
has
always
put
a
great
product
in
their
bottles
and
the
summer
ale
is
among
their
bestthe
hampshire
special
is
a
winner
too
it
pours
a
deep
amber
and
the
smell
is
of
light
tangy
citrus
with
an
undercurrent
of
hoppiness
the
taste
does
not
disappointit
is
bright
wheaty
and
happy
and
hoppy
perfect
for
a
summer
night
on
the
lakeshore
here
in
interior
downeast
maine
im
having
another
if
only
the
red
sox
could
produce
such
a
consistent
winner
gearys
the
premier
east
coast
revivalist
best
beer
in
my
opinion
is
not
the
hsa
but
their
summer
ale
this
is
not
only
for
the
cool
art
but
for
the
incredible
drinkability
and
taste
of
this
brew
it
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
fruity
with
hints
of
peach
and
mild
hoppy
bitterness
and
notes
of
a
summer
wheat
field
that
has
been
in
the
sun
all
day
the
taste
is
crisp
as
a
summer
should
be
proudly
displaying
the
rather
high
abv
for
a
summer
ale
with
mellow
fruity
esters
oak
and
vanilla
sharp
hop
bite
and
a
wheaty
dry
finish
perfectly
carbonated
for
that
summer
feel
as
well
get
as
much
of
this
as
possible
for
the
summer
haze
taste
starts
citrusy
even
juicy
in
its
lusciousness
this
is
a
succulent
beer
the
hops
and
the
yeast
dry
things
out
in
the
end
maybe
a
little
too
much
wonderful
summer
sipper
but
i
could
really
do
without
the
ringwood
aftertaste
the
summer
ale
poured
nicely
a
light
copper
color
with
a
nice
head
that
disappeared
to
the
rim
of
the
glass
rather
quickly
not
as
light
and
refreshing
as
expected
in
a
summer
ale
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
a
very
slight
citrus
flavor
emerges
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
this
would
be
very
drinkable
on
a
spring
or
fall
day
in
the
sun
or
during
a
poker
game
but
this
would
not
land
in
the
top
5
of
my
summer
ale
list
in
battling
the
heat
and
looking
for
a
great
thirst
quencher
that
is
why
i
marked
drinkability
at
a
3
5
pours
a
crystal
clear
deepamber
body
topped
by
a
short
head
of
creamy
ivory
foam
the
head
holds
well
maintaining
a
thin
lid
throughout
most
of
the
glass
and
even
leaves
some
nice
lace
along
the
way
the
nose
is
buttery
and
lightly
fruity
above
some
mild
spicy
hops
its
fine
slightly
elevated
carbonation
leaves
it
initially
crisp
in
the
mouth
but
its
medium
and
dextrinous
body
soon
rounds
it
out
buttery
diacetyl
remains
in
the
flavor
alongside
some
nice
fruitiness
white
grape
apple
light
strawberry
over
a
lightly
toasted
malt
base
its
wellbalanced
with
a
firm
bitterness
that
leads
into
a
longlingering
dry
finish
where
a
quick
flash
of
fruit
returns
but
is
quickly
replaced
by
a
rising
bitterness
some
residual
biscuity
malt
and
a
light
coating
of
spicy
hop
flavor
buttery
fruity
malty
and
fullflavored
with
a
very
long
finish
satisfying
pours
medium

recedes
to
leave

some

pear
some
spice
and
herbal
stuff
comes
in
the

and
a

body
is
a
bit
thin
but
a
very
enjoyable
summer
time
brew
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
a
real
pleasure
a
fine
beer
to
have
around
just
a
bit
heavy
for
cooling
me
off
on
a
hot
day
very
drinkable
pale
ale
but
it
really
seems
it
should
be
a
fall
beer
seeing
how
robust
it
is
the
pours
a
cloudless
burnished
copper
color
the
head
pythonic
in
size
creamy
in
consistency
the
color
a
winsome
light
tan
and
as
it
evanesces
the
lace
formed
a
satiny
sheet
to
meld
with
the
glass
sweet
malt

the
fresh
crisp
and
quite
sniffable
nose
start
is
malt
sweet
the

middling
in
its
feel

finish
has
a
tolerable
acidity
the
hops
perky
in
their
spiciness
dry
lingering
aftertaste
another
great
summer
session
beer
very
drinkable
my
favorite
summer
brew
not
only
for
the
beer
but
also
for
the
artwork
every
year
gearys
has
a
contest
with
the
portland
school
of
art
to
see
who
will
grace
the
label
the
artist
gets
a
prize
and
we
get
this
outstanding
beer
more
taste
than
most
summer
brews
this
one
does
not
need
any
citris
condiment
full
bodied
yet
somehow
light
it
goes
great
with
the
foods
of
the
season
i
look
forward
to
its
appearence
every
year
2003
version
much
of
the
same
clear
copper
color
thin
tight
white
head
nice
full
malt
flavors
underneath
a
refreshing
hop
bite
its
not
a
bitter
as
maybe
expected
but
super
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
like
this
years
label
better
campfire
on
the
lake
with
a
canoe
if
you
look
close
enough
you
see
a
little
guy
swimming
in
the

that
johnnyp
it
might
be
thanks
for
beer
jp
i
had
this
one
after
walking
loblolly
cc
finished
bogey
bogey
to
halve
my
match
with
old
man
par
he
had
to
give
me
six
shots
very
enjoyable
summer
beer
nice
thirst
quencher
golden
body
nice
effervesence
foamy
white
head
a
lot
of
malt
in
the
nose
big
malt
body
with
just
enough
hops
to
offer
some
balance
this
is
not
your
typical
summer
beer
but
it
is
a
summer
beer
if
youve
been
drinking
hampshire
special
ale
for
the
last
six
months
im
glad
its
a
seasonal
because
otherwise
it
might
not
find
its
way
to
jersey
no
apparent
wheat
or
lemon
here
but
a
fine
ale
any
time
of
year
light
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
smell
is
sweet
almost
sickly
sweet
that
sweetness
is
all
over
your
mouth
at
first
with
flavors
of
honey
and
light
vanilla
but
thankfully
hops
become
apparent
going
into
the
finish
partially
saving
this
beer
from
complete
malt
domination
its
still
a
good
bit
sweeter
than
i
want
in
a
summer
brew
refreshing
is
not
a
word
that
comes
to
mind
with
respect
to
this
beer
good
light
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
shows
promise
smell
is
slightly
sweet
from
the
strong
malt
of
this
brew
but
also
has
some
nice
floral
hop
qualities
to
it
strong
malty
taste
and
a
promise
of
some
good
hops
that
never
quite
comes
through
the
slight
lack
of
malts
leaves
this
beer
a
little
unbalanced
and
feeling
slightly
unfinished
somewhat
sticky
and
cloying
mouthfeel
that
takes
a
few
points
off
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
biggest
aspects
to
a
summer
beer
is
the
drinkability
and
this
brew
seems
to
be
a
little
lacking
in
that
department
definitely
the
weakest
offering
i
have
had
from
gearys
all
that
said
this
still
isnt
a
bad
brew
just
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
thanks
to
bierman9
for
the
sample
this
was
a
little
too
malty
for
my
taste
in
a
summer
brew
it
also
had
too
much
body
and
not
enough
hops
to
even
out
the
brew
i
did
not
detect
any
real
presence
of
citrus
notes
it
has
the
malt
taste
of
a
good
ale
but
for
me
is
too
much
for
a
summer
beer
this
beer
rocks
takes
the
qualities
of
a
big
heavy
beer
and
adds
a
summer
twist
to
make
it
refreshing
if
it
sounds
weird
thats
because
its
true
dark
dark
gold
bordering
on
copper
color
with
full
head
that
reduces
but
doesnt
vanish
some
hints
of
the
gearys
classic
pale
with
lighter
elements
of
lemon
wheat
and
grass
still
a
pretty
thick
beer
with
robust
caramel
malts
and
a
spicy
lingering
hop
finish
that
recollects
the
buttery
malts
as
well
not
too
refined
a
bit
raw
but
thats
what
makes
it
interesting
great
warm
but
also
delicious
icy
cold
the
perfect
brew
for
snatching
out
of
a
chest
of
ice
and
enjoying
as
it
rapidly
warms
in
the
summer
sun
220
this
a
less
than
average
beer
if
youre
really
thirsty
gotta
love
those
slightly
buttery
caramellike
toasted
and
biscuit
flavours
paired
with
that
distinct
ringwood
yeast
spicy
flavours
and
loads
of
fruity
esters
a
near
perfect
albiet
raw
on
the
palate
summer
time
beer
im
not
sure
if
naming
your
kolsch
chaser
is
a
genius
attempt
to
lower
expectations
or
not
but
i
liked
this
beer
had
at
tootsies
at
nashville
decent
beer

maybeyes
o
sometimes
beer
is
best
remembered
in
the
environment
in
which
you
are
drinking
it
in
this
case
i
was
in
my
parents
house
who
my
wife
and
i
were
visiting
on
vacation
and
enjoyed
their
company
accompanying
a
local
beer
a
kolsch
style
beer
that
i
kinda
like
i
think
its
the
bitterness
and
dryness
coming
through
that
sells
this
beer
for
me
i
like
me
them
hops
a
very
nice
kolsch
overall
kinda
meh
the
malts
arent
bad
but
not
perfect
for
the
style
and
the
hops
are
a
completely
different
world
not
close
to
what
i
expected
for
the
style
more
destined
for
a
british
pale
and
they
come
through
too
much
imo
o
a
middle
of
the
road
kolsch
that
is
what
the
style
should
be
easy
drinking
with
a
interesting
but
light
flavor
unfortunately
the
promise
of
the
aroma
got
muddled
in
the
flavor
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
blackstone
beer
but
makes
for
a
good
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
highly
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
kolsch
that
shows
nice
balance
between
malt
and
fruity
sweetness
its
a
decent
kolsch
and
went
down
easy
in
the
tennessee
heat
light
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
clean
finish
very
good
overall
for
the
style
would
be
a
solid
session
beer
or
summer
regular
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
esp
considering
the
price
also
nice
is
that
it
is
local
and
an
easy
tailgatingsession
beer
or
something
that
can
be
introductory
for
the
noncraft
drinkers
a
prper
summer
quencher
i
was
glad
to
try
o
chaser
pale
certainly
isnt
my
favorite
offering
from
blackstone
but
its
not
bad
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
make
a
very
good
lawn
mower
beer
very
average
beer
golden
colored
with
nice
clarity
medium
white
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
lace
the
smell
is
of
pale
malts
with
a
hint
of
fruity
hops
the
taste
is
bright
with
fruity
hints
of
citrus
on
top
of
pale
malt
quite
watery
but
crisp
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
had
this
as
one
of
the
samplers
standard
cleargolden
color
with
small
amounts
of
fizz
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
underwhelming
bits
of
pale
malt
is
about
all
i
get
from
this
one
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
that
helps
the
beers
character
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
carbonation
overall
a
ddrinkable
beer
not
bad
at
all
but
not
memorable
either
ontap
as
a
part
of
the
sampler
not
a
bad
beer
here
for
the
style
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
guess
a
nice
yellow
color
with
some
bonewhite
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
largely
of
pale
malts
making
me
think
macro
though
i
know
its
of
much
better
quality
taste
kind
of
follows
suitlight
malts
with
a
bit
of
lemon
and
citrus
splash
mf
is
lightbodied
wellcarbonated
refreshing
good
lawnmower

though
not
something
id

the

drinkability
very
dull
and
medicore
at
best
on
the
drinkability
scale
after
drinking
12
the
pint
i
lost
interest
good
beer
for
a
typical
macro
fan
overall
this
isnt
the
best
example
of
a
kolsch
ive
ever
had
the
finish
and
the
metallic
twang
is
somewhat
bothersome
i
just
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
rounded
and
hoppy
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
vanishes
into
a
trace
amount
of
lace
nose
has
some
lightly
sweet
fruitiness
with
a
bit
of
apple
as
well
as
a
clean
maltiness
taste
is
sweet
malt
mild
caramel
and
a
hint
of
fresh
pear
up
front
following
by
a
fruity
hoppiness
would
make
for
a
very
nice
summertime
beer
thanks
to
coldchill
for
the
sample
sounded
pretty
good
upon
ordering
not
sure
i
was
expecting
a
kolsch
no
matter
i
did
like
the
beer
though
its
pretty
bold
for
the
style
a
little
more
malty
than
expected
with
a
pronounced
caramel
apple
pear
flavor
that
expanded
the
brew
quite
a
bit
the
hops
were
also
bold
with
a
light
spicy
citrus
character
not
enough
to
change
the
beer
to
a
new
style
but
certainly
daring
for
a
kolsch
reminds
me
a
lot
of
summits
extra
pale
im
not
sure
whether
i
was
just
in
need
of
a
lighter
beer
at
the
time
i
sampled
this
one
at
a
local
beer
fest
or
what
but
man
was
it
good
a
light
gold
with
a
nice
thick
head
and
moderate
laicng
s
graininess
predominately
with
a
fair
amount
of
corn
aroma
t
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
grain
and
malts
trumping
any
hop
flavors
m
thin
but
appropriate
d
extremely
drinkable
and
a
good
choice
for
any
session
that
would
occur
in
warmer
weather
very
drinkable
this
one
thanks
to
ba
potsie
for
the
bopple
i
could
toss
back
these
with
gusto
especially
in
weather
like
this
though
id
get
a
hankering
for
something
heartier
just
how
i
am
bright
gold
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
theres
bit
of
citrus
fruit
and
light
wheat
maltiness
on
the
nose
the
flavors
are
somewhat
cream
ale
like
with
some
slightly
sweet
honey
malt
notes
the
body
is
relatively
light
and
it
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
decent
enough
summer
sipper
overall
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
its
hard
to
make
a
good
kolsh
and
blackstone
seems
to
have
succeeded

fresh
aroma
with
a

malt
dominates
the

a

beer
probably
very

the

there

possibly
some
noble

flavor
was
slightly
malty
with

easy
to
drink
ontap
at
the
2004
brewers
jam
in
knoxville
tn
which
this
brewery
has
attended
since
the
first
event
i
think
the
color
is
golden
with
some
slight
head
probably
hindered
by
the
serving
conditions
the
aroma
features
euromaltiness
and
a
hint
of
saaz
hops
spicy
and
minty
the
beer
features
a
crisp
finish
nicely
bittered
with
great
malt
flavors
that
are
subtle
but
very
complimentary
for
the
hop
notes
the
hop
flavor
is
nice
and
strong
without
being
overbearing
i
havent
had
a
real
kolsch
from
cologne
but
this
has
got
to
be
pretty
darn
close
great
a
pretty
darn
good
impression
of
a
kolsch
beer
from
a
sampler
pours

clear
gold
color
with
a
thin
white

barelythere
hops
aroma
mild
and
smooth
like
most
beers
of
the
style
not
particularly
impressive
as
the
hops
flavor
is
elusive
finish
is
a
little
watery
maybe
good
on
a
hot
day
but
otherwise
not
really
worth
it
a
pretty
good
take
on
the
kolsch
style
very
light
and
laidback
with
moderate
hops
bittering
and
not
a
lot
of
malt
presence
easy
drinking
but
not
particularly
memorable
not
my
favorite
from
this
series
but
good
beer
when
paddling
your
canoe
just
ok
nothing
really
great
this
has
a
nice
kolsch
taste
the
added
rye
makes
the
taste
slightly
heavy
for
repeatable
enjoyment
this
is
an
overall
nice
beer
though
really
really
simple
beer
from
leinenkugels
here
with
this
one
decent
summer
beer
best
offering
at
local
minor
league
team
on
dollar
beer
nights
appearance
was
light
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
subtle
but
had
notes
of
hop
and
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
in
it
the
taste
wasnt
bad
with
a
nice
mellow
flavor
although
the
aftertaste
was
a
tad
skunky
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
for
the
beer
as
well
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
bad
overall
uninspiring
but
not
truly
subpar
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
had
a
bright
gold
color
very
high
head
overflowed
the
bottle
when
opened
but
settled
down
into
thin
lacing
rather
quickly
very
faint
weak
smell
somewhat
grassy
the
flavor
was
a
sweet
grassy
malt
but
seemed
surfacey
it
could
use
a
little
more
depth
it
was
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
beer
for
a
summer
barbecue
wasnt
bad
at
all
poured
into
a
14oz
pint
glass
bright
gold
color
with
an
airy
head
the
nose
gives
off
scents
of
faint
grainy
malt
nothing
more
the
taste
pretty
much
continues
that
theme
sweet
grainy
malt
no
hint
of
hops
except
in
the
faintest
of
senses
yeast
is
lightly
fruity
bland
and
inoffensive
is
the
best
you
can
say
overall
ok
brew
not
my
first
choice
overall
its
an
okay
fall
beer
but
perhaps
too
dry
for
a
summer
beer
probably
good
to
pair
with
most
burgers
and
pub
food
a
beer
i
would
buy
a
6pack
of
but
not
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
a
full
case
of
overall
good
for
what
it
is
but
i
think
im
still
trying
to
get
my
bearings
on
this
kolsch
sort
of
thing
would
be
decent
if
it
was
an
american
adjunct
lager
as
a
kolsch
its
pretty
bad
for
me
this
was
lacking
the
crispness
i
like
in
a
kolsch
and
just
a
grainy
mess
this
is
a
solid
b
light
beer

make
up
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
really
not
much
here
that
would
make
me
think
this
is
anything

an

lager
just
a
short
snap
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
was
easy
to

and
quite
refreshing
as
i
worked
out
in

yard
today
id
have
it
again
i
have
to
wonder
what
this
would
taste
like
sidebyside
with

it
has
a

serving

very
smooth
excellent
head
with
very
light
hops
and
no
bitterness
great
find
thanks
to
the
folks
at
the
strange
brew
tavern
in
allentown
pa
got
this
on
a
whim
because
it
was
on
sale
a
lot
more
complex
than
the
light
summer
beer
i
expected
with
heavier
feel
darker
coloration
and
some
pleasingly
bitter
notes
overall
a
solid
crisp
and
refreshing
kolsch
but
not
as
good
as
the
ones
i
had
in
cologne
germany
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
kölschstyle
brew
that
ticks
all
the
boxes
for
this
particular
style
very
nice
color
and
aroma
with
a
mild
sour
and
smoky
aftertaste
not
too
carbonated
overall
a
very
pleasant
drink
that
goes
down
easily
042614
from
a
can
thanks
to
aj
at
super
buyrite
this
is
more
substantial
than
kolschs
ive
know
nothing
wrong
with
that
as
long
as
its
balanced
firm
head
atop
a
slightly
darker
beer
than
the
light
blondes
in
my
past
slight
aroma
doesnt
give
anything
away
as
to
the
fullness
of
the
mouthfeel
tastes
at
4
8
abv
it
could
be
called
a
session
beer
by
some
but
id
reserve
that
for
beers
of
a
lighter
body
at
the
risk
of
sounding
petty
ill
say
this
is
a
great
summer
evening
or
night
brew
but
starting
a
session
in
the
afternoon
with
this
candidate
may
be
costly
i
will
be
looking
out
for
it
again
this
summer
o
not
true
to
style
reminds
me
of
a
session
ipa
more
than
a
kolsch
drinkable
for
sure
but
not
soaring
to
the
top
of
the
leaderboard
for
me
of
kolschs
ive
had
overall
if
you
like
pear
its
good
as
kolsch
gets
in
usa
a
nice
american
interpretation
of
the
style
perfect
for
noshing
on
coneys
and
potato
salad
o
some
have
said
this
is
kind
of
like
a
macro
lager
well
i
drank
my
share
of
macro
lagers
the
night
before
and
let
me
tell
you
this
makes
every
one
of
them
look
like
a
sad
joke
for
one
its
actually
hoppy
i
would
have
no
trouble
drinking
this
all
day
thats
for
sure
overall
a
rather
decent
kolsh
that
is
fairly
refreshing
and
crisp
but
that
is
nothing
super
out
of
the
ordinary
high
value
excellent
drinkability
refreshing
during
the
warmer
summer
days
we
brought
some
of
these
to
recent
bbqs
and
beach
parties
where
they
really
hit
the
spot
plus
its
30
for
a
case
which
is
ridiculously
cheap
for
a
craft
beer
case
in
center
city
phila
o
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
and
it
brings
a
lot
of
flavor
something
to
chug
yet
something
to
savor
overall
i
would
not
recommend
this
i
would
rather
have
a
stale
kolsch
imported
from
koln
out
of
the
bottle
even
without
my
judgement
of
this
vs
german
kolsch
beers
it
does
not
stand
on
its
own
as
a
summer
beer
or
a
session
ale
theres
much
better
out
there
in
those
departments
as
well
o
this
was
the
right
fit
on
a
beautiful
summer
day
easy
to
drink
flavorful
some
bite
and
at
4
8
abv
gentle
on
the
bloodstream
d
pretty
mediocrepoor
example
of
the
style
not
sure
if
this
is
a
freshness
issue
or
just
not
that
good
of
a
beer
to
start
with
regardless
gets
a
big
pass
from
this
guy
nothing
incredibly
extravagant
about
this
kolsch
but
it
is
an
incredibly
refreshing
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
having
every
summer
poured
into
a
tall
kolsch
glass
what
else
pillowy
and
bright
white
head
that
takes
time
settling
atop
clear
brilliant
strawgold
liquid
light
bready
malty
nose
with
a
flowery
hop
tone
tell
me
this
is
promising
light
and
delicately
hoppiness
with
light

backing
finishes
crisp
and
hoppy
a
quintessential
hot
weather
session
drinker
hits
the
mark
here
during
the
current
nj
heatwave
delicious
overall
blahh
nothing
glaringly
bad
about
this
just
not
overly
exciting
solidly
average
real
refreshing
kolsch
going
to
be
enjoying
these
great
price
for
them
too
id
buy
this
again
easily
lancaster
kölsch
poured
a
pretty
yellow
with
a
clean
white
head
the
pour
produced
2
fingers
of
foam
that
stayed
at
half
a
finger
throughout
with
light
lacing
the
aroma
had
a
light
floral
note
with
the
characteristic
kölsch
backbone
true
to
form
the
taste
was
light
and
clean
a
solid
kölsch
offering
from
lancaster
brewing
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
kolsch
would
have
another
if
im
in
the
mood
pours
a
semi
hazy
bronze
color
with
and
inch
of
soapy
white
head
aroma
is
somewhere
between
bready
and
yeasty
with
some
straw
and
barnyard
elements
in
the
taste
malty
with
some
spicy
hops
and
yeast
hops
are
mild
herbal
and
tea
like
there
is
a
light
and
crisp
malt
body
overall
a
nice
clean
example
of
a
kolsch
easy
drinking
and
good
flavor
o
a
nice
surprise
to
be
sure
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
if
it
was
local
id
probably
buy
it
on
occasion
not
sure
if
this
is
contract
brewed
as
the
can
says
wilkesbarre
pa
i
bought
my
12pack
at
lancaster
brewing
company
on
plum
street
in
lancaster
o
a
great
summer
session
beer
very
refreshing
and
the
4
8
abv
isnt
going
to
wreck
you
this
in
an
under
appreciated
style
of
beer
in
my
opinion
and
one
i
always
like
to
sample
when
i
can
find
it
great
alternative
to
a
pilsner
or
a
wit
pours
a
paperthin
head
that
dissipates
into
a
ring
around
my
glass
hazy
gold
in
appearance
aroma
of
malts
butterscotch
and
citrus
fruits
smooth
and
tasty
easy
drinking
with
a
malty
citrus
finish
pretty
good
but
not
necessarily
true
to
the
kolsch
style
overall
an
easily
quaffable
kolsch
excellent
summer
style
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
fairly
well
done
example
of
the
style
that
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
brew
on
a
warm
day
this
isnt
a
style
of
beer
i
get
thirsty
for
frequently
but
today
it
hit
the
spot
thanks
for
sharing
pete
a
very
crisp
enjoyable
beer
for
these
hot
july
days
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
not
an
exemplar
but
good
enough
to
know
if
you
enjoy
and
appreciate
the
style
for
what
it
is
overall
nicely
done
maybe
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
in
terms
of
flavor
but
good
bitterness
to
back
it
up
i
like
this
beer
it
is
nice
and
light
and
yet
has
good
flavors
or
the
summer
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
good
representation
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
no
head
retention
whatsoever
hurts
this
brew
overall
pretty
good
not
very
refreshing
strong
flavors
without
much
complexity
i
find
it
had
to
see
the
kolsch
pedigree
but
its
not
as
hoppy
as
a
pale
ale
next
an
incredibly
sessionable
quenching
brew
definitely
a
summer
hit
at
parties
i
poured
this
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
23white
head
that
is
on
top
of
a
golden
color
body
the
smell
is
light
of
lemon
and
hops
the
taste
is
very
nice
and
crisp
i
get
a
sense
of
lemon
citrus
and
not
a
strong
taste
of
hops
but
it
is
present
it
has
a
great
mouth
feel
smooth
and
is
very
drinkable
goes
down
nice
pours
clear
with
ample
white
pillowy
head
head
lasts
a
while
and
has
a
medium
creamy
texture
body
is
medium
gold
almost
bronze
smell
is
of
spicy
rust
mild
grain
aroma
taste
is
hop
bitter
forward
carried
by
light
malt
i
want
to
say
they
used
northern
brewer
for
bittering
light
very
light
grain
however
overshadowed
by
the
hops
some
mild
spicy
hop
flavor
on
the
backside
light
and
fluffy
mouthfeel
hop
bitter
lingering
in
the
after
taste
mixed
with
some
can
flavor
if
this
didnt
have
the
slippery
and
creamy
mouthfeel
any
more
hop
bitterness
or
it
didnt
have
the
subdued
carbonation
it
does
i
dont
think
this
brew
would
do
it
for
me
an
easy
drinker
good
take
on
the
style
d
a
good
example
of
a
kolsch
which
is
not
a
style
that
i
particularly
care
for
but
this
beer
is
representative
of
the
style
and
is
done
well
light
and
easy
drinking
this
was
rather
middle
of
pack
for
me
as
far
as
the
kölsch
styles
go
just
a
lot
of
spice
here
and
that
syrupy
mix
of
sweetness
and
fruit
could
have
maybe
have
used
even
more
balancing
bitterness
than
what
was
there
not
horrible
by
any
means
but
there
are
some
others
out
there
that
i
would
go
to
first
i
do
like
the
canning
of
this
by
lancaster
though
we
need
more
cans
in
central
pa
dvery
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
may
not
be
a
spot
on
kölsch
but
it
is
very
good
and
i
will
look
for
it
again
d
good
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
summer
drinker
i
got
a
case
of
this
without
tasting
it
and
didnt
regret
it
i
heard
they
are
making
this
a
year
round
i
would
pick
this
up
again
overall
this
beer
is
thrown
off
by
the
buttey
flavor
it
seems
to
have
some
potential
but
it
isnt
quite
there
yet
d
i
liked
it
i
would
drink
a
sixer
in
no
time
and
with
the
luck
ive
been
having
lately
i
may
up
that
to
a
24
pack
in
one
of
those
funny
hats
that
you
sip
from
a
straw
out
of
two
beer
cans
parched
on
the
hat
homer
simpson
style
d
lbcs
kölsch
makes
it
easy
to
realize
the
importance
of
drinking
seasonally
ive
bought
2
cases
to
drink
throughout
the
summers
hottest
days
which
is
the
only
way
this
brew
should
be
enjoyed
bright
yellow
in
color
with
a
light
haze
a
thin
white
head
after
the
pour
that
leaves
a
nice
white
cap
and
wet
lacings
on
the
glass
light
fresh
floral
aroma
with
hints
of
lemon
and
biscuit
light
bodied
with
lower
than
average
carbonation
light
malt
biscuit
flavors
in
the
beginning
followed
by
citrus
lemon
and
orange
hop
flavor
and
very
crisp
finish
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
probably
the
best
beer
that
lancaster
makes
i
do
like
the
shofly
porter
alot
but
this
is
much
more
enjoyable
especially
since
i
can
get
this
locally
i
enjoyed
this
offering
its
got
a
bit
more
going
on
than
a
traditional
german
kölsch
but
i
appreciated
the
nuanced
flavor
in
a
light
beer
the
finish
needs
some
work
though
great
job
on
your
first
canned
beer
lancaster
i
did
it
right
a
kolsch
im
not
so
sure
i
would
have
guessed
this
one
by
style
had
i
tried
it
blind
maybe
an
american
wheat
ale
color
is
a
bit
darker
than
i
would
expect
it
to
be
but
still
a
light
gold
completely
clear
and
with
mild
carbonation
head
is
also
a
bit
smaller
and
lacing
is
again
a
bit
lacking
aroma
is
clean
subtle
and
a
bit
floral
some
very
delicate
grassiness
comes
through
in
the
finish
body
is
moderate
and
appropriately
so
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
the
summertime
i
actually
bought
this
especially
because
i
was
getting
overloaded
on
too
many
pale
ale
and
ipas
with
the
heat
high
humidity
this
beer
really
does
the
trick
compliments
food
well
and
doesnt
get
you
overly
hammered
at
one
sitting
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
with
some
full
flavor
d
somewhat
easy
to
drink
really
wish
it
had
an
extra
spark
or
two
of
carbonation
all
around
solid
nonetheless
d
a
tasty
ale
which
is
masquerading
as
a
kolsch
but
really
tastes
like
a
german
pils
with
the
malt
very
low
in
the
flavor
and
yeast
hidden
i
think
it
is
a
tasty
beer
just
misses
the
mark
for
kolsch
slighly
d
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
so
i
feel
a
bit
let
down
i
havent
tried
many
kolsches
but
i
remember
liking
other
examples
a
more
still
the
price
is
right
and
these
arent
bad
i
wouldnt
rule
out
a
case
purchase
in
the
future
d
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
lancaster
has
definitely
created
a
beauty
here
and
it
comes
in
a
can
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
like
the
can
claims
thats
really
all
that
needs
to
be
said
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
i
could
throw
a
12pack
of
this
on
ice
and
be
set
for
a
weekend
this
may
be
the
only
beer
these
guys
put
in
cans
but
they
sure
as
hell
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
had
a
can
for
4
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
it
was
a
slightly
hazy
golden
beer
with
a
short
head
this
wasnt
a
perfect
kolsch
but
it
was
plenty
tasty
and
went
nicely
with
the
fromager
daffinois
theres
a
crisp
herbal
citrus
hop
bite
followed
by
a
smooth
berry
fruit
character
its
a
good
summer
beer
check
it
out
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
malts
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
taste
is
crisp
a
touch
sweet
good
malt
and
hops
balance
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
overall
but
feels
a
little
heavier
then
others
in
the
style
carbonation
is
above
average
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
went
down
pretty
easy
on
this
hot
day
it
had
some
nice
clean
and
crisp
flavors
and
was
pretty
easy
drinking
overall
nice
suprise
seeing
a
new
seasonal
from
lbc
and
in
cans
at
22
a
case
i
couldnt
resist
can
says
wilkes
barre
pa
so
im
guessing
this
is
another
contract
brew
from
the
lion
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
with
2
fingers
head
a
bit
of
lace
sticks
on
the
glass
as
the
head
recedes
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
barn
full
of
hay
palate
is
nicely
balanced
with
cracker
malts
and
grassy
german
hops
also
notice
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
in
there
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
body
that
coats
the
mouth
and
lingers
a
bit
great
brew
for
the
summer
months
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
nice
surprise
to
see
a
lancaster
beer
in
the
almighty
can
this
one
pours
a
brilliant
golden
straw
color
with
a
big
frothing
bright
eggshell
white
head
fine
speckled
lacing
coats
the
sides
of
my
hennepin

amongst
a
nice

mix
going
on
lays
on
some
semi
sweet
biscuit
malt
presence
with
a
lemon
rind
grassy
earthy
finish
that
really
makes
the
beer
crisper
than
most
american
brewed
kolsch
great
dryness
in
the
finish
flavorful
session
beer
this
is
great
stuff
the
kind
of
light
beer
that
you
can
sink
you
teeth
into
carbonation
is
on
from
the
can
sometimes
ive
seen
carbonation
issues
thats
not
the
case
here
good
stuff
im
glad
i
bought
a
case
at
just
over
20
bucks
in
the
burgh
to
bring
in
the
fourth
this
weekend
d
oh
hells
yes
this
is
drinkable

bring
it
on
the
beach
with
you
total
summer
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
kudos
to
lbc
for
churning
this
one
out
much
better
than
the
rare
rooster
im
used
to
from
them
in
the
summer
its
about
time
lancaster
started
moving
in
the
right
direction
with
new
management
and
better
beer
quality
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
bill
moore
company
have
up
their
sleeves
for
the
fall
in
general
this
verion
is
much
more
flavorful
than
most
kolsches
ive
tried
but
far
from
too
heavy
for
the
warmest
of
days
im
very
interested
in
trying
it
in
the
can
and
took
a
12pack
home
all
in
all
an
extremely
good
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability
super
sessionable
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
and
humid
summer
day
in
the
northeast
my
pour
produced
just
over
a
fingers
worth
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
that
fell
like
the
raindrops
outside
my
window
on
this
hot
humid
summer
afternoon
color
was
a
hazy
goldenyellow
darker
than
the
straw
mentioned
on
the
can
i
definitely
smelled
grassy
hops
on
the
nose
almost
peppery
in
their
intensity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
dry
lagerlike
crispness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
the
same
hoppiness
but
accompanied
by
a
light
honeylike
flavor
i
am
impressed
by
their
first
canned
offering
and
look
forward
to
other
of
their
beers
in
a
can
in
the
future
this
would
certainly
go
into
my
cooler
and
if
others
need
help
in
getting
some
just
drop
me
a
beer
mail
d
pretty
good
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
this
at
a
bar
though
3
5
love
it
i
actually
brewed
kolsch
because
of
this
went
for
a
brewery
tour
and
the
guys
are
so
cool
and
friendly
my
favorite
by
far
from
this
brewer
i
snowshoed
into
some
backcountry
up
northwest
of
finland
mn
last
winter
and
i
had
three
kayaks
in
my
pack
i
stuck
em
in
a
snowbank
while
we
got
a
fire
going
and
man
was
that
some
good
beer
i
recommend
that
approach
but
its
good
any
time
poured
into
a
sester
stange
pours
a
medium
golden
amber
with
a
fine
one
finger
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
clove
light
wheat
flavor
is
light
sweet
malt
wheat
clove
light
lemon
citrus
finishes
with
sweet
wheat
and
light
close
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
light
bodied
a
nice
refreshing
kolsch
style
ale
with
the
approprate
light
malt
and
spicing
perhaps
a
bit
sweeter
and
clove
spicy
than
traditional
but
still
enjoyable
and
pleasant
fruity
amazingly
delicate
malt
bill
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
o
a
fairly
normal
kolsch
it
tastes
fine
and
is
fairly
easy
drinking
not
quite
as
clean
as
most
in
the
style
but
its
decent
worth
a
try
overall
as
a
whole
theres
nothing
really
outstanding
that
i
can
say
about
this
beer
aside
from
its
honeylike
flavor
which
couldve
been
a
little
stronger
as
such
its
not
outstanding
beer
but
its
still
a
decent
brew
very
well
made
kolsch
right
here
a
great
intro
to
craft
for
bmc
folks
too
very
sessionable
brew
that
would
be
perfect
for
summer
not
many
brewers
tackle
this
style
but
i
wish
they
would
glad
to
have
a
local
option
available
keeping
in
mind
ive
had
this
beer
in
the
fridge
for
over
6
months
id
say
its
held
up
quite
well
the
kolsch
style
is
one
we
should
be
consuming
rather
fresh
yet
despite
its
age
this
beer
is
still
very
refreshing
with
crisp
malty
bite
a
body
that
doesnt
interfere
with
the
subtle
flavors
and
a
bustling
carbonation
to
perk
up
your
palette
cheers
brew
pours
a
translucent
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
aromas
mostly
of
grain
noble
hop
aroma
and
notes
of
grape
tastes
as
it
smells
i
get
grain
and
cereal
malt
as
the
base
of
the
flavor
grape
hangs
in
the
background
finishes
with
yeast
and
very
very
mild
hop
bitterness
feels
crisp
and
refreshing
a
light
bodied
lightly
carbonated
very
sessionable
brew
nothing
jumps
out
at
me
about
this
beer
but
im
really
enjoying
it
it
has
a
touch
of
sour
kinda
like
bells
oarsman
but
less
so
that
im
really
enjoying
on
this
hot
summer
day
a
balanced
mostly
malty
light
beer
but
flavorful
and
refreshing
o
a
nice
sessionable
beer
for
the
summer
its
quite
different
from
other
kolchs
ive
had
before
but
not
bad
for
the
style
very
drinkable
with
a
pleasing
aftertaste
of
cereal
and
citrus
clean
and
crisp
the
betterthanlager
alternative
drinkability
could
be
sessionable
but
i
find
the
grainy
finish
offputting
drinkability
is
very
good
one
of
the
best
takes
on
this
style
ive
had
refreshing
and
a
little
subtle
this
beer
fits
in
to
the
kolsch
paradigm
well
im
very
happy
to
still
see
this
brand
around
town
at
retail
as
theres
no
doubt
plenty
of
competition
for
just
such
a
beer
in
the
marketplace
d
pretty
decent
session
beer
good
summertime
brew
this
is
the
first
of
the
style
ive
had
and
i
havent
heard
many
good
things
about
the
style
but
this
is
ok
not
amazing
or
blow
you
away
at
all
but
a
little
different
and
refreshing
poured
a
12oz
into
my
horny
goat
pint
glass
vibrant
yellowishorange
hue
with
a
weak
head
that
dissipated
quick
not
leaving
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
smells
fresh
and
lemony
not
a
very
powerful
scent
but
still
nice
smooth
and
fresh
tasting
with
very
little
aftertaste
very
tiny
amount
of
hoppy
bite
on
the
front
with
a
slightly
fruity
back
not
very
complex
but
kolsch
is
not
the
wildest
variety
of
brew
i
like
it
a
lot
perfect
session
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
could
see
drinking
several
bottles
of
this
it
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
overall
aroma
and
taste
is
a
little
muted
but
it
truly
is
refreshing
i
could
see
enjoying
this
all
day
long
during
a
hot
summer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
very
nicely
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
d
this
was
a
real
shocker
for
me
i
was
really
impressed
by
how
true
this
kolsch
is
to
the
style
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
ive
only
had
one
other
kolschstyle
beer
also
not
a
true
kolsch
so
i
cant
say
one
way
or
the
other
whether
its
true
to
style
i
just
liked
it
it
tastes
fruity
sweet
as
well
with
just
a
little
diacetyl
in
the
background
the
fruit
i
would
describe
it
tasting
like
would
be
grapefruit
lemons
and
white
grapes
a
better
tasting
kolsch
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurts
its
drinkability
maybe
i
had
an
old
bottle
but
i
enjoyed
enough
of
the
beer
to
give
it
another
try
in
the
summer
when
a
beer
like
this
would
be
better
appreciated
very
nice
stuff
very
easy
to
drink
very
easy
to
like
a
solid
brew
for
summer
sipping
just
a
little
bit
different
than
many
typical
summer
beers
yet
nothing
that
strange
either
id
easily
have
another
if
i
had
another
thanks
to
mnwags
for
this
bottle
d
very
nice
a
tasty
straightforward
and
worthwhile
light
beer
kudos
to
the
brewers
in
west
duluth
for
this
offering
dont
miss
it
if
youre
in
the
duluth
area
d
pretty
good
just
dont
judge
by
the
look
of
it
its
a
light
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
just
like
a
kölsch
ought
to
be
d
my
initial
reaction
to
this
beer
was
lower
but
i
tried
a
couple
more
and
realized
it
was
much
better
than
my
first
impression
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
well
i
fittingly
had
this
beer
on
tap
about
60
ft
from
the
shores
of
lake
superior
in
the
northern
lights
restaurant
in
beaver
bay
mn
surprising
number
of
quality
beers
on
tap
there
by
the
way
it
had
a
bit
of
a
strawlike
quality
to
the
color
rather
pale
but
with
a
slight
orange
glow
it
was
a
sweet
taste
a
little
more
than
expected
faint
taste
of
grapes
maybe
good
mouthfeel
maybe
a
bit
high
on
the
carbonation
but
satisfying
to
keep
in
there
and
swish
about
very
dry
finish
good
beer
but
not
so
much
so
that
i
wont
look
to
sample
a
different
tap
beer
the
next
time
in
that
place
d
goes
down
easy
i
would
be
surprised
if
a
kolsch
didnt

bottle
slightly
hazy
rich
golden
pour
with
a
full
finger
of
crystal
white
head
diminishing
aroma
of
terse
hops
and
esters
im
having
problems
with
this
brewers
beers
tasting
like
stryofoam
right
off
the
bat
im
getting
some
notes
of
wheat
hops
and
sourness
the
finish
continues
with
rubbery
esters
and
then
morphs
into
a
mellow
lemon
wheat
i
think
that
its
just
me
im
trying
to
rate
this
in
fairness
beyond
the
stryofoam
i
review
beers
that
might
be
infected
because
if
thats
what
the
brewer
puts
out
there
then
thats
what
im
getting
and
especially
with
this
brewery
infection
has
been
a
rampant
problem
ive
had
three
bottles
of
this
particular
style
and
theyve
all
been
the
same
popured
a
slighly
hazy
golden
color
with
moderate
white
puffy

is
minimal
with
a
slight

follows
through
on
the
smell
with
a
mild
summer
fruit
note
present
very
nice
drinkability
a
nice
thirst
quencher
goos
session
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
definately
a
simple
but
tasteful
beer
here
great
for
summer
pours
a
nice
gold
with
white
head
smells
sweet
and
light
tastes
of
slightly
caramel
malts
not
much
bitterness
but
a
little
bit
of
citrus
quite
pleasant
at
first
i
wished
it
were
a
touch
more
crisp
but
id
say
carbonation
is
on
for
the
style
comparable
to
just
about
anyones
kolsch
or
summer
ale
cheers
doverall
it
is
good
i
can
see
this
as
a
summer
quencher
by
the
pool
very
drinkable
i
could
see
having
1
or
2
of
these
much
like
everything
else
lsbc
makes
its
very
approachable
not
overly
challenging
which
is
fine
imo
all
in
all
a
decent
effort
ill
need
to
try
some
others
in
this
category
before
determining
how
it
compares
this
brew
pours
a
semicloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
large
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
some
tangy
untertones
the
taste
is
quite
pleasant
orange
with
some
nice
tanginess
the
mouthfell
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
might
fine
brew
it
is
a
lot
tastier
than
i
had
anticipated
and
quite
relaxing
drinkability
this
one
is
pretty
good
for
drinkability
worth
a
try
and
surely
not
one
to
turn
away
i
have
a
digital
camera
so
maybe
i
will
get
a
picture
of
this
beer
for
the
website
in
the
future
damn
nice

not

this

its

its
just
a
thin
tasting
drink
i
would
imagine
it
is
pretty
light
too
i
havent
had
too
many
of
this
style
yet
so
i
may
not
be
the
best
person
to
ask
aroma
is
initially
a
light
sweet
malt
that
quickly
turns
to
a
more
sour
quality
leveling
off
with
a
hop
floweriness
mixed
with
the
sourness
darker
golden
color
and
clear
smallish
head
but
decent
stamina
light
in
overall
flavor
mix
has
similar
qualites
of
the
aroma
that
being
a
base
of
malt
surrounded
by
the
slight
sourness
and
a
shot
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
probably
a
little
too
sour
for
an
ale
i
find
it
lacks
enough
combination
of
smoothness
and
creaminess
this
style
often
entails
containing
only
some
smoothness
overall
an
average
beer
i
think
a
little
too
sour
and
bitter
for
style
and
that
prevents
it
from
being
a
nice
summer
ale
too

on
the
pour
a
lightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
the

modest
in
size
frothy
bright
white
in

and
the

a
nice
sheet
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is

slightly
sweet
and
buttery
crisp
and
clean
with
the

a
pleasant
sweet

top

and
the
finish
pleasantly
hopped
the
acidity
mild
and
the
aftertaste
dry
a
bit
thin
waisted
for
me
but
i
think
it
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
i
imagine
this
beer
would
be
a
decent
summer
lightbodied
beer
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
it
again
a
fine
enough
ale
but
i
cant
shake
that
they
missed
the
mark
a
bit
if
they
were
brewing
a
kolsch
this
hazy
yellow
beer
throws
a
good
1
inch
head
that
gives
some
decent
lacing
this
brew
has
got
something
wrong
in
the
aroma
i
get
a
menthonal
like
odor
way
off
especially
for
a
kolsch
ipa
or
pa
might
get
away
with
it
by
saying
it
has
an
extreme
pine
odor
but
not
this
style
drinking
this
beer
is
like
drinking
diluted
pine
sol
just
not
worth
it
i
dont
think
ill
waste
the
space
in
my
stomach
with
this
one
pale
straw
color
aroma
is
mild
but
fresh
very
fleeting
and
delicate
flavor
even
for
this
style
but
retains
mouthfeel
very
well
this
is
pretty
drinkable
when
im
in
the
mood
for
subtle
malt
thirst
quenching
bottle
was
a
little
skunky
what
i
could
get
other
than
that
seemed
pretty
good
aroma
is
pale
malts
and
slightly
perfumed
the
flavor
is
fruit
pale
malts
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
o
a
nice
and
light
beer
with
some
good
flavors
and
complexity
the
grapeyness
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
it
fits
the
style
and
it
kind
of
tastes
like
fruity
pebbles
prosit
overall
just
a
slight
skunky
note
about
this
that
keeps
it
from
being
fantastic
very
clean
and
refreshing
though
o
awesome
standard
for
this
style
the
best
kolsch
ive
ever
had

the
spot
if
its
warm
sunny
lay
down
your
money
for
sunner
klosch
o
yummy
and
very
drinkable
but
nothing
overly
remarkable
a
good
kolsch
not
necessarily
great
mainly
because
it
feels
so
softflat
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
kolsch
and
a
great
lawnmower
beer
if
this
were
readily
available
and
cheap
i
would
drink
it
constantly
0
i
disagree
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
if
you
have
never
experienced
the
magic
of
kolsch
this
is
definitely
a
must
try
if
you
know
kolsch
its
pretty
lame
as
kolsch
is
fragile
and
best
drunk
young
before
even
minor
amts
of
oxidation
turn
it
into
just
another
quickly
forgotten
thirst
quencher
nice
light
refreshing
beer
ideally
suited
for
a
hot
sweltering
summer
day
this

a
light

carbonation
aroma

and
noble

grassy
herbal
flavors
are
sweet
grain
upfront
and
some
noble

i
also
get
some
subtle
apple
or
pearlike
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
mouthfeel

crisp
with

and

of

is
also
dominated
by
biscuit
malt
with
faint

juice
lightly
tart
finishes
crackery
with
light
grassy
hops
light
to
medium
bodied
an
unusual
opportunity
to
try
a
relatively
fresh
kegged
kolsch
the
style
is
not
intensely
flavored
so
this
fresh
version
was
not
noticeably
an
improvement
on
the
bottled
versions
but
it
was
interesting
to
be
able
to
drink
it
fresh
from
the
tap
i
nice
classic
kolsch
that
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aromas
of
fresh
grain
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
taste
begins
with
a
clean
zesty
spicy
hop
flavor
followed
by
a
cracker
malt
middle
and
clean
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
good
kolsch
that
i
would
get
again
overall
one
of
the
originals
and
very
enjoyable
more
people
should
have
an
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
out
a
pretty
tasty
and
enjoyable
version
of
the
style
and
with
a
certain
street
cred
given
its
origins
but
not
the
best
kölsch
ive
ever
had
those
new
world
brewers
can
just
be
a
bitch

the

a
bottle
at
that

id
pick
this
up
again
o
a
nice
kölsch
true

the

the
light
sour
twist
was
quite
nice
drinkability
light
tasty
and
refreshing
this
is
good
stuff
its
not
bad
but
not
memorable
or
distinct
in
fairness
i
have
no
idea
how
old
it
is
it
didnt
look
like
a
big
mover
at
the
store
its
not
a
beer
id
buy
again
because
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
much
of
an
identity
so
theres
no
real
reason
to
if
it
was
what
was
available
for
a
session
with
friends
fine
no
problem
youd
forget
the
name
by
the
next
day
an
enjoyable
kolsch
that
hits
all
of
the
style
requirements
i
drank
this
right
after
a
fruh
kolsch
and
preferred
fruh
for
its
more
refined
and
brighter
flavors
along
with
the
lower
abv
that
said
sunner
is
plenty
enjoyable
on
a
spring
day
and
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
all
around
delicious
and
satisfying
representation
of
the
kolsch
style
id
drink
er
again
o
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
this
light
beer
perfectly
marries
ale
and
lager
characteristics
with
notes
of
fruit
while
remaining
crisp
clean
and
exceptionally
drinkable
rjt
this
is
a
great
kölsch
without
a
doubt
when
i
was
in
cologne
years
ago
i
dont
think
i
had
this
one
but
then
again
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
kölsch
in
this
caliber
and
again
this
isnt
an
imperial
ipa
or
saison
or
anything
explosive
but
i
believe
weeks
after
drinking
extreme
beers
nonstop
my
palate
is
thanking
me
very
much
for
something
this
flavorful
yet
extremely
easy
and
mellow
to
drink
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
pair
with
food
but
honestly
after
a
long
day
of
work
or
a
warm
day
this
does
the
trick
for
being
as
flavorful
as
most
good
quality
pilsners
yet
lighter
in
character
looking
for
a
top
quality
kölsch
when
rating
to
style
this
is
the
one
heres
a
perfect
outdoor
drink
on
a
warm
day
to
watch
the
world
go

too
many
average
brews

tastelessness

a
clear

a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable

refreshing
enjoyable
beer
refreshing
and
tasty
slightly
sweet
but
balanced
good
traditional
kolsch
o
i
suppose
its
refreshing
in
that
its
a
drinkable
liquid
which
doesnt
taste
of
tar
water
but
otherwise
its
nothing
im
sure
that
there
are
people
whod
enjoy
it
a
lot
but
as
a
brit
whos
fed
up
with
the
multiplicity
of
soulless
european
lagers
on
tap
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
ever
brings
back
great
memories
of
sipping
suds
at
the
imbuss
in
germany
nice
light
traditional
german
kolsch
with
just
a
fine
bit
more
bitter
flavor
than
a
usual
german
pils
very
little
after
taste
i
might
purchase
again
but
with
so
many
to
choose
probably
not
o
fairly
simple
in
its
design
its
basically
a
good
example
of
a
kolsch
nice
drinkable
lager
with
some
crisp
clean
flavours
that
leave
the
drinker
feeling
refreshed
pleasant
aroma
and
nice
appearance
which
would
have
been
better
drinking
from
a
glass
raither
than
straight
from
a
bottle
what
was
i
thinking
the
taste
was
magnificent
if
you
like
kolschs
which
has
become
my
one
of
my
new
fave
styles
nexter
to
pale
ales
doulble
ipas
and
porters
try
this
i
like
this
beer
and
it
deserves
a
higher
rating
and
im
gonna
help
it
achieve
one
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
light
hue
slight
head
and
sporadic
lacing
nose
is
fuller
than
the
appearance
suggests
with
a
pungent
grainy
and
citrus
tone
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
light
and
crisp
combination
of
sourdough
bread
and
lemon
citrus
with
a
biting
pungent
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
in
my
admittedly
limited
tastings
of
kolsch
this
has
come
closest
to
the
true
style
a
paragon
of
its
breed
sunner
kolsch
is
an
awesome
beer
for
late
spring
or
early
fall
prost
comes
perilously
close
to
being
a
lawn
mower
beer
tastes
like
the
smell
except
for
the
low
presence
of
hops
the
swallow
has
a
creamy
flavor
and
body
great
price
on
this
baby
under
4
bucks
for
a
large
bottle
pours
a
very
very
light
looking
clear
sunshine
yellow
colow
with
very
bright
carbonation
and
a
3
inch
white
head
that
clings
to
the
sides
of
my
pilsner
glass
smells
like
light
munich
malts
and
bittereing
hops
in
excellent
balance
flavor
has
the
same
profile
but
its
just
so
light
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
terribly
unexciting
feel
is
nice
though
with
good
bubbles
and
a
very
light
body
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
in
its
traditional
sense
but
i
tend
to
prefer
some
of
the
bigger
american
versions
with
a
more
complex
malt
palate
overall
though
a
well
made
brew
that
serves
its
purpose
doesnt
show
for
much
to
start
but
strong
baseline
of
sweetness
assertive
hop
bitterness
and
seriously
lean
body
what
a
kolsch
should
be
in
other
words
as
always
wonder
what
its
like
on
tap
or
even
fresher
312
exp
date
here
overall
a
simple
refresher
but
i
am
waiting
for
that
real
bread
and
baking
character
but
its
just
not
coming
i
could
have
this
again
but
id
grab
a
different
kolsch
if
i
had
a
choice
uh
oh
what
a
sec
bottle
best
before
march
2012
hmmm
i
would
most
definitely
try
this
again
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
color
the
head
is
about
1
finger
of
white
foam
with
moderate
retention
no
lacing
lots
of
fruit
and
grains
in
the
nose
getting
some
apricot
orange
white
grape
apple
and
wheat
also
picking
up
some
pleasant
floral
hop
notes
in
there
again
very
fruity
tons
of
apple
and
apricot
and
the
wheat
gives
in
a
nice
smooth
finish
carbonation
is
very
refreshing
first
time
having
this
one
never
been
a
fan
of
kolsch
style
beer
but
damn
this
stuff
is
tasty
not
bad
at
all
very
thirst
quenching
drinkability
an
avergae
beer
in
the
german
style
kolsh
o
great
beer
for
any
time
of
year
highly
quaffable
o
very
impressive
could
drink
a
good
few
of
these
great
aroma
on
this
one
fuller
body
at
first
but
lightens
up
and
finishes
dry
at
the
end
nice
simple
sweetness
with
mild
but
green
hop
flavors
i
could
drink
this
all
night
o
this
is
only
the
second
time
ive
had
a
kolsch
so
im
by
no
means
a
wellrounded
critique
after
reading
the
label
i
now
understand
the
kolsch
to
germany
is
the
champagne
to
france
and
is
something
to
be
revered
and
protected
its
an
interesting
hybrid
of
ale
fermentation
and
lagering
techniques
i
can
really
respect
the
subtleties
of
this
beer
it
could
easily
get
dismissed
for
mediocrity
or
nothing
greatl
but
i
suspect
the
execution
of
such
a
wellbalanced
yet
subtle
and
light
beer
could
be
of
greater
difficulty
than
brewing
something
more
robust
drinkability
is
a
massive
factor
with
this
beer
this
would
be
brilliant
and
very
sessionable
on
a
hot
sunners
day
excuse
the
pun
o
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
example
of
a
kolsch
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
gladly
have
this
one
again
and
possibly
many
of
them
in
an
afternoon
in
the
sun
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
kolsch
o
overall
its
nice
i
dont
mind
it
and
is
as
good
as
if
not
better
than
the
few
other
kolschs
i
have
tried
dr
very
drinkable
but
not
the
most
drinkable
kolsch
ive
had
its
a
pleasant
beer
brewed
to
tradition
what
you
expect
is
exactly
what
you
get
and
theres
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
might
try
it
on
draught
but
honestly
there
are
better
more
innovative
kolsches
out
there
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
and
had
a
nice
dry
finish
to
it
the
beer
was
well
carbonated
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
the
low
abv
really
added
to
the
enjoyment
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
will
try
to
keep
this
one
in
my
beer
fridge
more
often
this
beer
pours
a
standard
yellow
with
a
nice
cap
of
white
foam
which
left
adequate
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
bread
malt
and
some
apricot
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
on
the
palate
it
comes
alive
with
crisp
clean
flavors
the
malt
is
a
subtle
blend
as
it
moves
swiftly
into
the
dry
center
and
finishes
with
a
tangy
snap
of
hops
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
a
beautiful
example
of
the
style
from
the
source
o
while
this
beer
isnt
terrible
it
definitely
does
have
its
fair
share
of
flaws
o
a
good
tasting
quenching
summer
beer
something
i
would
pick
up
again
for
a
large
group
o
this
is
okay
but
a
little
too
advillike
a
kolsch
direct
from
the
source
awesome
except
theres
sediment
all
through
the
bottle
and
a
good
chance
this
babys
skunked
oh
well
the
pour
went
smoothly
thick
cloudy
head
with
nice
lacing
down
the
pint
glass
to
reveal
an
brilliantly
clear
golden
color
not
much
in
the
nose
maybe
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
taste
shows
no
signs
of
being
oxidized
or
any
offflavors
just
straightforward
crisp
malty
smooth
i
feel
like
a
kolsch
is
drank
more
for
the
mouthfeel
than
the
flavor
smooth
dry
refreshing
sunner
invented
this
style
of
beer
and
delivers
on
this
aspect
tastes
great
this
one
and
urges
more
consuming
hail
hail
sunner
kolsch
not
the
greatest
kolsch
but
one
of
the
best
draught
busch
gardens
this
one
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
there
was
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
there
is
a
nice
nose
to
this
one
floral
and
grassy
notes
some
malts
and
maybe
a
touch
of
fruit
the
taste
is
also
good
very
smooth
earthy
malts
and
a
touch
dry
nice
a
fantastic
kölsch
to
be
sure
not
as
much
fruit
character
as
some
but
enough
to
be
quite
delcious
i
love
it
and
its
fantastic
in
the
summer
o
a
basic
but
perfectly
sessionable
lager
one
dimensional
but
just
the
thing
for
a
hot
summer
evening

pours
a
clear

gold
highlycarbonated
with
a
thick
finger
of
white
head
that
laces
well
and
retains
a
nice
cap
of
fine
lather
smells
sweet
grainy
metallic
almost
cornlike
like
an
american
lager
at
first
blush
becomes
more
malty
and
hoppy
as
it
warms
with
something
powderymedinical
that
fades
with
time
lemons
and
pale
malt
on
the
palate
lightly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
spicyfloral
hops
that
contribute
a
mild
bitterness
another
dimension
is

with
grass
and
fresh
hay
overall
very
smooth
and
soft
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
fine
drying
carbonation
and
a
medium
finish
a
great
example
of
the
style
that
arrived
here
in
good
shape
delicious
wellbrewed
and
worth
a
try
if
you
are
just
getting
to
know
the
style
poured
a

head
which
dissipated
completely
very
light
clear
straw
yellow
color
smells
of
malt
and
grain
taste
and
mouthfeel
have
just
a
slight
advantage
over
standard
bmc
not
much
of
a
finish
to
it
although
id
prefer
this
to
standard
bmcs
and
i
was
grateful
it
wasnt
skunked
it
just
didnt
excite
me
this
light
to
moderate
bodied
brew
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
balanced
and
very
crisp
all
at
the
same
time
nice
to
see
this
one
available
in
my
market
ill
be
seeking
it
out
again
in
the
near
future
a
highly
drinakble
hybrid
beer
with
exquisite
balance
of
cracker
malts
floralspicy
hops
and
a
mild
estery
reinforcement
of
apple
and
pear
all
without
the
sulfur
character
that
usually
plagues
german
lagers
ideal
for
hot
summer
afternoons
damn
fine
summer
drinking
and
confirmation
that
in
my
zeal
for
the
extreme
ive
completely
missed
some
of
the
great
beers
of
the
world
o
a
good
tasting
quenching
summer
beer
something
i
would
pick
up
again
for
a
large
group
worth
a
try
but
i
personally
wont
seek
it
out
3
5
dhighly
drinkable
and
balanced
but
not
a
lot
to
this
one
i
prefer
other
kolschs
ive
had
narrative
oh
great
another
argument
about
this
i
feel
like
this
happens
way
too
often
the
chief
cheese
sommelier
for
kraft
american
singles
found
himself
rolling
his
sleeves
up
far
too
often
oh
you
think
you
are
just
gonna
sit
in
seat
19b
im
sorry
mr
fancy
cheese
maker
he
sighed
knowing
the
extent
of
the
marketing
campaign
the
extent
of
foodies
irrational
hatred
and
the
monicre
that
the
merger
with
nestle
had
imparted
listen
i
am
not
trying
to
be
a
fancy
anything
i
just
want
to
check
my
bags
and
he
could
see
their
eyes
all
leveled
at
him
screeching
childhood
obesity
epithets
their
spiteful
glances
the
forthcoming
envelopes
full
of
frightening
white
powder
ok
ok
enough
i
am
a
cheese
maker
that
is
it
i
dont
aspire
to
be
the
best
i
am
mediocre
and
i
recognize
that
who
among
you
can
admit
their
mediocrity
the
eyes
of
the
cabin
all
leveled
checking
themselves
except
one
errant
korean
man
who
proudly
declared
why
can
you
has
to
making
cheese
i
am
19b
the
hoi
polloi
nodded
in
approval
of
this
reproach
more
dynamic
than
id
expect
of
a
kolsch
but
thoroughly
enoyable
on
a
warm
spring
day
o
style
wise
its
not
a
favorite
i
think
i
would
rather
have
a
pilsner
great
flavor
and
is
light
on
the
palette
while
not
my
favorite
style
this
is
good
for
what
its
meant
to
be
a
sessionable
beer
and
originally
a
competitor
for
light
lagers
drinkability
this
goes
down
pretty
easily
i
coul
deasily
drink
45
of
thse
in
one
sitting
a
well
done
beverage
that
would
go
really
well
on
a
hot
summers
day
the
same
can
be
said
of
the
taste
it
was
very
refreshing
very
light
had
a
barley
taste
a
bit
of
hops
and
only
a
bit
fruity
at
the
end
this
was
a
very
light
and
balanced
beer
d
ive
had
better
versions
w
lower
abv
d
quite
drinkable
refreshing
pick
it
up
especially
if
you
enjoy
kolschs
notwithstanding
the
texture
or
lack
thereof
it
does
add
to
ones
ability
to
just
tip
this
crisp
refreshing
drop
right
down
great
stuff
not
a
great
beer
but
a
light
clean
and
pretty
drinkable
one
i
guess
its
more
the
style
itself
that
i
have
a
problem
with
but
this
does
seem
to
be
a
below
par
example
even
stylistically
very
smooth
beer
for
sure
but
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
i
like
the
structure
and
the
flip
flop
you
get
as
it
works
its
way
thru
your
palate
from
drybittersweet
back
and
forth
a
quencher
for
sure
but
this
one
would
be
dominated
by
food
decent
but
not
outstanding
d
i
havent
had
too
many
kolschs
but
i
like
this
brew
i
really
enjoy
this
very
simple
but
this
is
pretty
much
what
a
kolsch
should
be
if
you
are
looking
for
a
lighter
beer
with
some
more
flavor
this
is
it
something
i
would
recommend
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
quickly
diminishing
head
aroma
is
sweet
with
distinct
grass
and
wheat
flavors
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
on
the
front
end
with
almost
a
sour
apple
flavor
finishing
is
bitter
hops
with
very
strong
wheat
and
cereal
notes
really
an
average
kölsch
overall
give
me
mühlen
or
reissdorf
any
day
over
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
foam
on
top
of
the
beer
smells
of
grain
with
a
crisp
apple
sweetness
taste
is
very
crisp
and
fresh
and
its
a
very
full
taste
most
predominantly
there
is
a
light
sweet
malt
taste
with
a
bit
of
grassiness
and
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
its
an
easydrinking
beer
with
a
reasonable
abv
this
would
be
a
great
summer
evening
beer
to
share
with
a
couple
pals
d
quite
drinkable
refreshing
anyone
got
any
input
here
please
reply
to
this
is
one
drinkable
beer
due
to
the
slightly
dry
finish
reminiscent
of
a
czech
or
german
pilsener
i
cant
believe
its
not
lager
md
the
carbonation
really
makes
this
easy
to
drink
nothing
really
complex
tasting
but
worth
trying
out
if
youre
in
a
easy
drinking
kind
of
mood
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
run
out
and
always
get
but
mostly
because
personally
i
enjoy
more
bold
flavors
d
all
around
great
kölsch
it
tastes
like
the
real
deal
true
to
form
would
be
great
to
have
a
sixer
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
this
is
a
very
nice
kölsch
that
left
me
wanting
more
the
light
body
makes
it
very
drinkable
an
average
kolsch
smell
is
greater
than
the
taste
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
i
must
note
that
when
i
exhale
after
drinking
i
can
taste
corn

and

color
with
some
floaties

slightly

with

other
interesting

dry

crisp
much
like
a
white

i
dont
know
how
they
do
that
it
must
be
the
yeast
mouthfeel
is
spoton
for
the
style
and
overall
a
great
tasting
beer
that
is
different
enough
to
make
it
a
nice
departure
from
german
and
czech
lagers
think
of
kölsch
as
an
ale
that
has
stronglagerlike
tendencies
simple
but
very
good
great
summer
bottle
another
import
found
on
tap
at
the
black
forrest
inn
in
minneapolis
this
one
shows
a
pale
but
clear
gold
with
a
fair
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
hints
at
mild
wheat
and
vague
citrus
a
bit
lame
perhaps
its
very
crisp
feeling
and
delivers
on
the
flavor
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
generally
closer
to
cereal
than
any
hop
character
its
light
bodied
well
carbonated
and
highly
drinkable
but
it
is
not
very
memorable
for
the
flavor
needs
a
little
more
on
the
malt
citrus
side
to
make
the
grade
but
not
a
bad
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
afternoon
tap
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
served
in
a
0
2l
kolsch
glass
golden
amber
with
brilliant
clarity
and
a
sticky
white
head
mild
but
clean
pale
malt
aroma
slight
stone
fruit
corn
and
buttered
white
bread
palate
is
rather
mild
as
well
malty
with
a
trace
of
diacetyl
that
prevents
this
from
being
as
crisp
as
some
of
the
better
kolsch
out
there
it
has
a
trace
of
hops
in
the
finish
but
its
not
as
bitter
or
firm
as
id
like
pretty
enjoyable
but
not
stellar
drinkability
kölsch
is
a
pretty
drinkable
style
overall
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
i
wish
it
had
a
little
less
pronounced
grain
character
though
minerals
and
bleached
cracker
crust
hit
the
palate
first
followed
by
bread
dough
and
a
delicately
bitter
bite
from
the
grassy
hops
crisp
clean
finish
leaves
behind
only
the
slightest
hint
of
lemon
peel
and
soapiness
great
mouthfeellight
and
bubbly
without
getting
so
carbonated
that
the
flavor
suffers
all
in
all
a
decenttogood
drinkable
kölsch
not
something
ill
make
a
habit
of
purchasing
but
sünner
definitely
holds
up
well
in
the
scorching
austin
heat
overall
this
is
a
perfect
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
as
its
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
manages
to
pack
more
flavor
in
than
a
runofthemill
lawnmower
beer
making
it
more
interesting
this
could
also
be
a
great
gateway
beer
to
introduce
noncraft
beer
drinkers
to
something
new
one
of
the
better
kölsch
beers
ive
had
the
sweetness
is
kept
in
check
here
and
it
is
crisper
than
others
nothing
special
but
still
good
a
really
good
kolsch
a
lot
of
times
i
feel
like
this
is
a
much
underappreciated
style
and
i
love
to
pick
up
kolsches
that
ive
never
had
before
for
me
they
are
like
a
nice
refreshing
lager
but
with
more
complexity
and
they
just
feel
softer
to
me
likely
due
to
the
ale
yeast
i
cant
wait
to
go
back
to
germany
sometime
and
drink
them
again
on
hot
summer
days
am
rhein
d
certainly
easily
drinkable
with
the
standard
kolsch
smellflavour
structure
unfortunately
just
not
the
cleanest
kolsch
i
have
had
d
easily
drinkable
good
example
of
the
style
excellent
for
the
summer
heat
very
good
representation
of
this
style
a
perfect
gateway
beer
for
those
that
want
to
step
into
the
craft
beer
world
this
style
has
its
place
and
this
is
a
very
good
choice
d
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
one
that
i
would
love
to
try
on
tap
in
germany
some
day
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
incredibly
refreshing
enough
of
a
malt
backbone
to
keep
it
interesting
while
not
getting
to
heavy
in
the
body
for
my
money
local
brewer
metropolitan
makes
a
superior
kölsch
that
will
always
be
fresher
and
tastier
unless
im
drinking
this
in
germany
pours
a
ripe
gold
thin
head
smell
is
subdued
flowers
on
top
and
bitterness
beneath
taste
is
similar
a
light
crisp
and
almost
pilsner
like
consistency
mouthfeel
is
exceedingly
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
is
huge
taste
is
mostly
light
malt
some
bread
and
unripe
banana
hops
are
a
bit
weak
in
this
one
the
crispness
and
spice
doesnt
really
come
through
in
effect
its
a
light
malt
centered
beer
doesnt
have
that
zip
at
the
end
not
at
all
its
good
just
not
to
style
imo
the
pour
is
crystal
clear
yellow
golden
in
color
with
a
nice
head
that
dissipates
nose
of
apple
and
straw
with
a
mild
mild
pollen
quality
palate
is
that
with
mild
sweet
of
honey
backed
by
a
soft
bitter
finish
some
apple
too
along
with
a
bit
of
floral
hop
a
nice
body
crisp
and
refreshing
a
style
that
seems
to
be
disregard
as
a
summer
brew
great
palate
is
light
refreshing
and
wellbalanced
slightly
sweet
bready
malt
up
front
with
a
nice
dose
of
light
citrusy
hops
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the
body
is
wellcarbonated
but
not
fizzy
and
light
enough
to
match
the
more
subtle
flavor
profile
of
the
style
definitely
a
drinkable
refreshing
beer
but
still
a
notch
or
two
below
reissdorf
in
the
hierarchy
of
german
kolschs
the
beer
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
floral
hops
grapes
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
wheat
as
well
as
flowery
and
spicy
hops
you
also
get
some
green
grape
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
opinion
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
drank
way
too
many
of
these
at
a
renaissance
festival
in
koln
once
and
this
totally
takes
me
back
there
it
is
light
and
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
so
easy
you
can
put
away
enough
to
make
you
goofy
without
realizing
it
i
plan
to
give
this
beer
high
marks
as
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
on
tap
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
greensboro
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
clear
lighter
golden
with
a
thinner
white
head
atoparomas
are
of
toasty
grain
and
a
bit
mown
grass
mainly
a
lighter
to
medium
feel
to
the
beer
wich
is
good
for
the
styleflavors
have
a
real
toasted
quality
and
the
hops
give
a
good
crispness
to
the
finish
it
seems
lighter
than
the
abv
it
goes
down
very
easily
a
nice
warm
weather
brew
thats
delicate
but
flavorful
golden
straw
color
carbonation
bubbles
racing
through
tht
body
sizeable
white
head
on
top
with
solid
retention
describes
how
this
beer
looks
the
nose
features
some
sweet
pale
malt
but
also
some
steeley
corn
sweeteness
note
i
couldnt
figure
out
fortunatley
its
taste
although
light
was
refreshing
without
major
offflavors
theres
a
kiss
of
honey
a
little
bready
malt
touches
of
husky
malt
with
sweet
pale
malt
making
the
base
flavor
the
beer
is
light
in
the
mouth
crisp
carbonation
bubbles
are
teeny
tiny
and
a
little
sweetness
lingers
in
an
other
wise
dry
finish
a
gulpable
beer
overall
and
a
good
alternative
to
all
the
german
lagers
d
although
it
is
a
decent
representative
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
sünner
is
a
tad
underhopped
and
seems
a
bit
monotone
compared
to
gäffel
and
reissdorf
nonetheless
sünner
delivers
a
crisp
and
refreshing
brew
that
still
has
much
more
flavor
than
other
brands
competing
in
this
market
pours
golden
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
light
white
head
that
quickly
dissolves
aroma
is
light
pilsner
malt
and
musty
the
flavor
is
light
malt
with
some
noble
hop
flavor
its
light
modied
and
has
a
nice
prickly
carbonation
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
kolschs
but
i
thought
overall
this
was
drinkable
but
nothing
exciting
which
to
my
understanding
is
kind
of
what
the
style
is
about
anyways
the
body
was
light
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
was
active
yet
smooth
pretty
nice
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
i
wish
i
saw
on
tap
more
frequently
taste
is
more
lagerlike
than
many
american
versions
with
not
quite
as
many
yeast
esters
coming
out
light
grainy
malts
are
the
dominant
flavor
there
is
a
mild
cardboard
flavor
in
here
that
i
usually
only
get
out
of
a
bottle
but
that
is
a
very
minor
complaint
there
is
some
nice
hop
bitterness
that
adds
some
snappy
crispness
to
the
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
with
this
beer
carbonation
is
just
right
and
has
an
excellent
creamy
texture
i
have
not
had
many
germanmade
kolsches
before
but
this
one
is
a
bit
milder
compared
to
most
of
the
american
versions
very
nice
kolsch
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
beer
straight
forward
good
beer
nothing
special
just
good
beer
poured
with
a
medium
off
white
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
aroma
is
just
plain
fresh
common
beer
more
of
a
world
lager
than
anything
spicy
flavor
is
similar
but
sweeter
although
not
too
sweet
soft
body
and
good
carbonation
nice
clean
bittersweet
finish
session
beer
kolsch
is
not
a
style
that
travels
well
at
its
freshest
it
can
be
interesting
this
is
a
weak
example
of
the
style
though
d
really
good
example
of
a
session
beer
the
mouth
is
crisp
with
good
carbonation
it
is
a
very
easy
drinker
a
great
beer
with
lighter
nonspicy
food
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
one
in
chicago
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
body
is
crisp
but
still
retains
some
smooth
creaminess
i
like
that
flavors
of
light
tart
citrus
some
faint
grassy
hops
and
some
sharp
grains
there
is
a
bit
of
a
metallic
twang
to
it
right
off
but
as
i
continue
to
drink
this
fades
maybe
im
used
to
it
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
id
have
it
again
for
sure
quite
refreshing
drinkability
is
just
ok
nothing
really
specials
to
want
me
to
have
another
and
that
metallic
taste
doesnt
really
help
either
m
light
and
crisp
with
very
high
drinkability
this
is
a
good
kölsch
though
it
isnt
the
best
one
ive
had
it
seems
a
bit
harder
to
find
than
gaffel
or
reissdorf
and
those
are
the
only
two
i
have
seen
here
in
the
us
it
is
a
decent
brew
but
suitable
mainly
for
summer
or
during
a
vacation
to
köln
note
the
label
indicates
that
sünner
kölsch
is
5
3
abv
this
is
a
bit
unusual
as
every
other
true
german
kölsch
ive
ever
tried
has
been
4
8
sunner
kolsch
is
quite
possibly
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
ive
ever
tasted
it
pours
the
expected
clear
golden
body
beneath
a
twofinger
thick
head
of
white
foam
the
head
retention
is
very
good
and
it
leaves
some
very
nice
lacing
about
the
glass
the
aroma
displays
a
sweetish
straightforward
malt
a
hint
of
yeasty
fruitiness
and
notes
of
floral
hops
and
the
flavor
follows
suit
but
in
a
fuller
way
its
sweetish
at
first
then
fruity
and
finally
florally
hoppy
with
a
light
touch
of
spiciness
as
the
bitterness
rises
somehow
it
comes
to
a
balance
before
it
leaves
the
mouth
and
then
it
dries
even
more
as
the
malt
quickly
erodes
leaving
behind
a
gentle
but
solid
bitterness
and
hints
of
floral
grassy
and
spicy
hops
remarkably
drinkable
really
very
drinkable
though
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
but
ive
had
waaaay
better
examples
of
the
style
overall
this
is
very
close
to
being
an
incredible
kolsch
its
just
a
matter
of
a
few
little
things
that
combine
to
make
it
less
than
amazing
but
certainly
above
average
a
great
summer
lawnmower
beer
with
a
little
more
flavor
than
your
average
hot
day
swill
a
good
beer
that
fits
into
the
unique
and
underappreciated
niche
of
the
kolsch
very
well
balanced
tasty
beer
a
bit
sweet
at
the
outset
turning
more
sour
at
the
end
i
tend
to
prefer
dark
malty
brews
and
was
surprised
that
i
liked
this
one
so
much
i
found
it
more
interesting
and
satisfying
than
some
of
the
american
versions
of
this
style
goes
to
show
go
to
the
source
seems
like
a
fresh
bottle
which
could
be
a
problem
with
the
import
delays
not
to
bad
of
a
price
2
50
for
the
500ml
tasty
enough
brew
to
try
again
this
beer
pours
a
pale
see
thru
straw
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
with
average
lacingthe
aromas
are
grapedoughy
malts
and
some
honeydewit
has
a
nice
silky
mouthfeel
to
it
with
hints
of
sweet
lemony
citrus
that
finishes
very
nicely
dry
and
crispa
very
refreshing
beer
that
could
drink
alot
of
on
a
nice
hot
summers
day
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
full
grain
character
some
hay
hints
of
mineral
pear
peach
it
settles
into
a
soft
fruity
grain
finishing
with
a
dryish
slightly
spicey
crisp
finish
with
dry
hints
of
peach
and
pear
drinks
alright
this
one
seems
a
bit
tired
from
its
atlantic
crossing
i
remember
this
being
better
in
germany
most
american
versions
are
better
than
the
average
import
due
freshness
plus
care
handling
500
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
budweiser
colored
which
i
suppose
is
typical
with
a
creamy
white
cap
of
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
lightly
floral
with
a
touch
of
lemon
tartness
flavor
is
a
little
less
substantial
some
sweet
bready
grains
a
whisper
of
citrus
and
a
crisp
mineral
finish
thin
refreshing
body
perfect
on
a
scalding
california
summer
day
d
a
very
good
thirstquenching
quaffer
just
as
a
good
kölsch
should
be
light
but
smooth
feel
only
slightly
watery
trace
resins
in
the
finish
then
smoothing
out
again
gentle
to
moderate
carbonation
can
also
be
spritzy
d
i
dont
know
why
so
few
kolsches
are
exported
this
is
only
the
2nd
cologne
made
one
ive
had
an
under
the
radar
style
especially
for
the
summertime
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pintglass
a
crisp
bubbly
yellow
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
a
decent
blend
of
crisp
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
nice
subtle
blend
of
hops
and
malts
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
but
undertoned
and
fitting
to
the
style
the
beer
is
quite
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
version
of
the
style
good
beer
to
drink
when
the
conversation
is
more
important
than
the
beer
i
had
a
16
9
ounce
bottle
and
poured
the
beer
into
a
half
liter
glass
a
nice
pale
yellow
color
with
a
little
head
i
could
barely
smell
anything
i
think
there
was
a
faint
grass
smell
i
could
not
taste
anything
the
beer
was
almost
tasteless
there
was
no
aftertaste
and
only
a
little
hop
bitterness
it
was
almost
like
drinking
water
so
id
consider
this
as
a
good
thirst
quencher
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
lighter
beer
with
enough
substance
to
make
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
d
highly
drinkable
as
per
the
style
and
very
tasty
d
a
very
wellcrafted
kolsch
it
holds
the
balance
between
dry
and
sweet
flavor
profiles
very
well
this
is
a
great
summer
brew
a
cooler
full
of
these
on
the
beach
sounds
pretty
damn
good
flavour
was
very
dry
with
a
crisp
clean
and
very
lightly
sour
character
the
label
says
it
is
sweet
but
i
found
it
sour
as
if
wild
yeast
were
involved
this
is
a
lovely
dry
beer
that
wouldshould
be
a
winner
in
the
australian
summer
theres
a
depth
of
aromatic
interest
and
lippuckering
goodness
that
would
shame
the
disgusting
dry
macro
lagers
that
proliferate
here
these
interesting
flavours
and
softsparkly
mouthfeel
make
it
a
real
winner
should
be
more
of
it
d
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beer
styles
its
a
very
good
example
of
what
kolsch
should
taste
like
i
recommend
this
highly
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
soapy
bright
white
cap
a
bit
of
clumpy
lace
decent
head
retention
floral
hop
aroma
crackers
light
lemon
light
bitterness
malt
bit
of
hop
spice
and
lemon
nice
balance
light
bodied
on
the
crisp
side
a
good
kolsch
light
and
refreshing
but
with
some
flavour
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
soft
clean
lightly
carbonated
and
almost
crisp
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
nil
i
never
have
like
the
american
version
of
the
kolsch
it
is
not
delicate
and
rough
on
the
palate
i
am
glad
that
the
german
kolschs
are
a
whole
lot
better
overall
i
like
this
bier
it
isnt
the
best
kolsch
out
there
but
it
is
a
damn
good
one
do
yourself
a
favor
and
have
this
bier
prosit
having
only
ever
had
a
couple
real
kolschs
in
my
life
i
am
a
little
hesitant
to
go
hard
on
it
not
being
too
sure
how
good
or
not
these
beers
can
be
anyway
it
is
pale
straw
colour
with
a
weak
head
and
not
a
great
deal
going
on
nosewise
starts
off
fresh
with
a
slight
apple
aroma
but
goes
sulphury
quite
quickly
as
it
warms
this
may
well
explain
why
they
are
served
in
small
glasses
in
koln
still
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
little
sweetness
but
an
essentially
dry
finish
tis
good
and
drinkable
but
reserving
judgement
on
calling
this
style
classic
drinkability
well
my
only
slight
on
this
is
its
abv
at
5
4
its
just
a
bit
too
high
for
something
thats
so
sessionable
sooo
refreshing
especially
considering
its
28deg
c
inside
at
the
moment
poured
from
a
1pt
0
9oz
bottle
purchased
at
eagle
provisions
in
brooklyn
just
over
3
the
beer
is
pale
golden
colored
crystal
clear
with
a
thin
wet
foam
the
aroma
is
subdued
like
all
good
kolsches
a
little
musty
or
funky
but
really
in
a
light
way
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
malty
maybe
a
little
estery
fruit
flavors
not
much
the
definition
of
drinkable
at
5
3
abv
with
a
light
body
this
the
second
time
i
have
drunk
this
the
first
time
i
found
it
a
bit
more
fruity
i
might
have
to
revisit
a
good
example
of
a
somewhat
restricted
style
and
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
it
is
quite
easy
drinking
but
is
almost
watery
i
have
never
really
been
a
huge
fan
of
kolsch
and
i
think
this
has
turned
me
off
even
more
very
watery
almost
a
lighter
taste
similar
to
heineken
the
bottle
was
good
until
late
in
08
but
i
think
a
fresh
version
would
be
sharper
this
seems
to
be
the
case
with
a
lot
of
german
beers
overall
i
would
drink
this
sunner
kolsch
any
time
anywhere
nothing
overwhelmed
me
good
or
bad
except
the
fact
that
it
had
a
really
full
flavor
that
i
havent
found
in
any
of
the
other
koln
kolschs
even
my
beersampling
but
not
beerfanatic
wife
thought
that
it
was
good
which
is
a
huge
statement
tasting
it
yesterday
from
keg
and
today
from
botle
with
exp
date
25705
can
only
come
to
one
conclusion
great
brew
what
you
want
of
you
order
a
koelsch
nice
appearance
with
white
head
that
lasts
quiet
ok
very
malty
nose
and
wheat
noticeable
further
good
and
clean
yeast
and
a
hoppy
nose
though
this
botle
version
has
not
as
much
as
the
sampled
kegbeer
had
full
and
clean
taste
also
malty
just
litle
sweet
and
nice
and
dry
hopfinish
mouthfeel
is
great
and
a
beer
thats
a
perfect
sessionbeer
in
my
eyes
so
drinkability
is
more
then
just
ok
too
by
the
way
4
8
abv
smell
blech
all
the
same
still
and
the
taste
ranges
from
a
watery
sort
of
pils
with
a
bit
extra
wheat
that
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
really
nothing
exciting
about
it
sünner
is
golden
and
luminous
like
other
kölsch
beers
and
offers
the
same
gigangtic
and
overflowing
white
head
the
smell
is
extremely
floral
and
notes
of
pepper
are
evident
taste
is
light
delicate
and
full
of
the
same
floral
notes
a
broad
and
mellow
malt
base
is
also
evident
mouthfeel
is
average
a
tad
watery
for
my
tastes
and
in
comparison
to
what
i
see
as
a
great
kölsch
drinkability
is
really
the
highlight
of
this
beer
its
taste
are
all
delicate
and
mellow
and
leave
you
with
no
offensive
aftertaste
id
assume
this
would
be
a
great
summer
session
brew
though
ive
sadly
only
drank
this
when
it
was
rather
cold
out
schade
not
a
very
good
kölsch
as
a
homebrew
judge
i
have
seen
a
few
homebrews
in
the
style
with
the
same
problems
it
seems
quite
hard
to
make
a
good
kölsch
i
know
this
beers
from
massachusetts
but
it
reminds
me
of
the
whole
chesapeake
scene
youve
gotta
give
me
some
leeway
here
im
from
the
midwest
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
brass
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
relatively
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
white
bread
slight
melon
flowers
and
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
bread
enveloping
the
melonlemon
mixture
while
flowers
rain
down
upon
the
proceedings
the
body
straddles
the
border
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
nearly
slick
feel
overall
a
niceenough
kolsch
one
that
embraces
the
subtlety
of
the
style
but
one
that
stills
leaves
me
wanting
a
bit
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
july
7
2012
the
pour
is
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
quick
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
immediately
the
aroma
is
of
grains
with
a
crisp
hop
note
but
the
bottle
i
got
must
have
been
skunked
because
i
also
got
a
of
that
on
the
nose
light
body
the
taste
has
all
the
right
characteristics
of
a
kolsch
with
grains
and
a
moderate
bitterness
but
the
skunked
character
distorted
my
judgement
served
on
tap
at
latitude
43
in
gloucester
presented
in
a
standard
pint
glass
hazy
orange
colored
body
no
real
head
moderate
carbonation
though
smell
was
pretty
unremarkable
nothing
too
noticeable
taste
was
good
just
a
hint
of
malt
and
hops
so
its
a
very
light
tasting
beer
thats
the
standard
idea
of
a
kölsch
to
not
overwhelm
you
with
anything
and
thats
what
you
get
its
a
very
mild
flavored
easy
drinking
beer
it
may
not
be
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
smooth
beer
with
relatively
low
abv
this
one
might
be
the
one
for
your
session
went
fairly
nicely
with
my
fried
clam
roll
for
lunch
overall
this
beer
didnt
fit
very
well
into
the
style
and
wasnt
nearly
as
clean
as
it
should
be
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
kolsch
pretty
good
session
beer
youre
not
going
to
get
much
head
on
this
one
but
look
forward
to
a
dynamic
taste
the
taste
is
primarily
malty
but
expect
quick
bursts
of
lemon
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
creamy
with
hints
of
carbonation
an
accessible
beer
with
some
subtle
quirks
that
makes
for
a
steady
companion
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
it
is
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
particularly
since
the
lemon
adds
some
refreshing
properties
bought
a
sixpack
at
table
and
vine
the
drink
poured
with
a
large
head
and
levels
of
patching
across
the
glass
the
appearance
was
a
crisp
gold
look
with
a
slight
amber
color
aromas
were
strong
with
sweet
grains
flavors
and
an
earthy
tone
the
taste
had
a
good
flavor
initially
but
the
taste
kind
of
dissipates
quickly
generally
speaking
it
had
a
sugary
sweet
taste
with
light
hops
mouthfeel
was
light
and
watery
pretty
refreshing
actually
overall
not
too
bad
grainy
malt
presence
muddles
the
flavors
a
little
that
said
its
a
pretty
crisp
drink
certainly
more
variety
in
the
flavor
profile
than
would
have
been
provided
by
a
lager
yeasttheres
even
a
soft
vinous
character
drying
grassy
herbal
hops
i
think
the
sweetness
is
about
right
it
works
with
the
hop
flavoring
the
hopping
is
quite
assertive
i
must
add
too
much
for
my
tastes
d
very
nice
summer
refresher
not
a
complex
bouquet
of
flavors
but
pretty
much
what
a
kolsh
should
be
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
d
this
is
an
extremely
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
bbq
or
after
some
yard
work
could
enjoy
a
few
in
this
setting
but
would
seek
something
more
challenging
otherwise
found
this
in
a
build
a
6pack
store
id
never
tried
a
kolsch
so
wanted
to
at
least
give
it
a
try
incredibly
smooth
soft
texture
very
little
carbonation
great
for
a
session
beer
very
subtle
flavoring
i
had
it
with
mexican
food
was
a
great
pairing
it
allowed
the
spices
in
the
food
to
really
come
through
drinkability
probably
the
best
ive
received
so
far
from
amazing
clubs
a
solid
brew
that
i
would
have
again
definitely
a
summertime
beer
d
overall
this
was
an
ok
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
great
smells
and
tastes
strongly
of
malt
and
breadgrain
and
didnt
really
have
much
hops
to
it
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
hey
its
nice
for
a
free
beer
a
surprise
brew
indeed
drinkability
i
could
have
two
or
three
a
solid
above
average
kolsch
that
sticks
to
the
style
i
like
the
flavor
combinations
smells
malty
with
a
light
breadiness
pours
to
a
hazy
light
brown
with
a
multisized
bubble
creamy
head
taste
is
quite
balanced
but
a
little
more
on
the
sweet
side
no
bitterness
but
a
flat
tartness
in
the
background
throughout
and
more
evident
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
but
doesnt
try
to
overpower
the
taste
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinker
good
and
solid
with
a
nice
backbone
and
a
finish
leaving
one
desiring
another
sip

is
a
great

d
a

not
a
standout
but
a
good
brew
refreshing
mouthfeel
i
wish
more
brewers
did
kolsch
the
flavor
of
an
ale
with
the
smoothness
freshness
of
a
lager
very
sessionable
modest
good
for
summer
this
went
down
really
well
a
great
change
of
pace
it
made
me
realize
that
ive
been
drinking
way
too
much
amber
and
ipa
lately
great
beer
great
style
mind
you
this
is
beer
for
grownups
no
distinctive
fruit
flavors
no
tartness
no
bullshit
gimmicks
this
would
pair
well
with
most
food
because
it
is
so
stripped
down

real

another

no

slightly
fruity
with
a
strong
metallic
note

with
a
metallic
after

that
i
did
not
like
light
mouthfeel
and
a
crisp
carbonation
maybe
its
the
kolsch
style
i
dont
like
but
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
and
its
not
meant
to
be
a
put
down
for
this
beer
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
more
regular
access
to
this
beer
as
it
would
be
a
summer
staple
for
me
much
stronger

in
the

a
hoppy
pale
ale
weaker
pal
malt
flavors
proper
body
for
the
style
which
is
to
say
thinner
than
most
pale
ales
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
received
this
as
part
of
a
botmc
it
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
light
perhaps
a
few
grassy
notes
up
front
this
one
has
an
assertive
bitterness
that
smooths
out
with
a
malty
sweetness
the
brew
is
well
carbonated
light
bodied
and
made
to
be
consumed
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
very
goood
beer
this
makes
a
fantastic
warm
weather
beer
without
being
too
light
or
boring

dissipated
within
seconds
into
a
thin
broken
band
around
the
perimeter

very
drinkable

taste
is
light
and
crisp
malty
but
has
a
weird
grassy
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
that
kind
of
distracts
from
the
overall
feel
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
too
amazing
dont
think
id
buy
it
on
its
own
but
as
part
of
a
mixed
pack
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
this
one
but
this
beer
does
not
provide

crisp
refreshment
i

looking
for

this
a
a

nice
stab
at
the
style
interestingly
the
aroma
doesnt
quite
match
the
taste
imo
and
the
latter
is
truer
to
style
its
light
but
with
a
nice
taste
i
could
drink
this
easily
as
a
refresher
or
easy
sessioner
d
pretty
light
and
easy
to

pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
color
w
a

which
dissipates

leaving

grainy
in

mouth
with
mild
fizziness
nice
the
bottle
foamed
over
the
second
i
opened
it
im
not
sure
if
it
was
overcarbonated
or
maybe
it
accidently
got
knocked
around
in
my
fridge
other
than
all
that
i
really
enjoyed
this

down
very
easily
not

good
representation

this
is
a

sessionable
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
dgreat
beer
easily
the
best
that
is
offered
by
this
brewery
i
could
definately
drink
this
all
night
worth
getting
a
growler
of
it
12oz
brown
bottle
from
tiger
town
in
gardiner
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
color
with
a
thin
film
of
foam
smells
like
caramel
toffee
grass
and
a
bit
of
pepper
tastes
biscuity
and
caramelly
with
a
tinge
of
fruit
and
pepper
toward
the
finish
light
both
in
body
and
in
carbonation
less
drinkable
than
expected
an
okay
beer
overall
but
a
kolsh
it
is
not
this
was
served
up
a
light
amber
color
with
an
average
white
head
and
decent
lacing
it
has
a
light
wheat
and
cracker
aroma
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
flavor
brings
on
more
of
the
exact
same
ideas
i
got
from
the
aroma
except
there
is
more
of
the
dry
hop
bitterness
it
has
some
lager
like
qualities
at
first
but
the
hoppy
ale
takes
over
its
medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
drinkable
enough
but
not
a
delectable
enticement
so
much
as
i
would
like
generally
a
good
quality
option
though
i
hate
having
to
knock
points
off
for
inauthenticity
because
this
is
one
fine
beerbut
im
just
not
sure
its
a
kolsch
absolutely
worth
your
time

d
really
good
drinkability
and
interesting
flavors
would
make
you
coming
back
for
more
party
on
the
poop
deck
with
this
1
wow
what
a
head
on
this
ale
the
beer
pours
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
orange
amber
with
a
prodigious
head
and
intense
lacing
this
thing
poured
right
over
the
top
of
my
glass
and
talk
about
retention
the
smell
is
grapefruity
hop
spices
a
bit
metallic
some
very
tart
citrus
and
some
bready
malts
the
beer
is
quite
carbonated
and
the
continuous
efforvescence
will
attest
to
that
the
taste
is
definitely
tart
hops
there
is
some
buttery
maltiness
in
the
finish
but
the
tartness
the
acerbic
hop
quality
and
the
slightly
metallic
bite
is
what
is
most
pronounced
the
beer
starts
out
quite
dry
but
once
it
settles
in
a
bit
there
is
slightly
less
sharpness
the
tartness
rounds
out
and
more
of
the
maltiness
and
bread
like
qualities
begin
to
emerge
as
well
as
the
more
warming
spices
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
definitely
on
the
light
side
in
what
you
would
expect
in
this
style
i
will
seek
out
this
brewery
cape
ann
with
some
interest
because
it
is
local
for
me
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
astringent
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
lightish
and
refreshing
worth
scouting
around
for
lchaim
this
was
nice
definitely
a
joy
ride
for
those
who
like
their
beers
bitter
dry
i
am
craving
a
big
deli
sandwich
fries
a
pickle
wedge
i
could
see
this
being
a
killer
lobster
paring
as
well
as
various
whitefish
done
simply
some
dry
cheddar
or
cotswold
maybe
anything
with
spinach
bitter
simple
potatoes
artisan
bread
while
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
every
day
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
was
rather
nice
recommended
especially
if
you
like
dry
bitter
give
it
a
shot
a
pleasant
kolsch
that
is
not
as
bland
as
most
versions
of
the
style
light
drinkable
and
worthy
of
grabbing
another
hey
i
liked
it
id
hope
some
more
people
might
give
it
a
try
overall
a
nice
kolsch
a
good
summer
beer
for
sure
this
beer
is
tasty
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
wonderful
appearance
in
the
glass
i
thought
the
aroma
was
a
bit
subdued
but
otherwise
this
is
one
tasty
brew
o
kölsch
beers
are
not
my
favorite
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
reminds
me
of
the
old
rust
belt
lagers
of
the
1970s
with
a
little
more
flavor

really
nice
i
havent
had
many
kolschs
at
all
but
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
its
just
a
great
beer
a
light
abv
beer
that
isnt
light
on
flavor
is
always
a
plus
for
the
style
this
is
outstanding
overall
a
solid
beer
but
not
outstanding
a
great
spring
time
style
beer
smells
great
looks
great
and
taste
great
bottled
for
the
first
time
in
2012
wish
they
had
bottled
it
in
2013
but
is
currently
at
the
pub
and
worth
a
growler
fill
for
sure
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
done
well
enough
that
i
like
it
superdrinkable
and
light
although
this
suffers
a
bit
from
being
just
a
tad
uninteresting
by
the
time
you
reach
the
second
half
of
the
beer
nice
example
of
the
style
and
overall
very
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
no
doubt
o
refreshing
and
generally
enjoyable
metallic
taste
is
a
bit
offputting
i
would
like
another
and
i
did
buy
again
nice
to
have
on
a
hot
day
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
kolsch
not
as
refreshing
as
others
i
have
in
this
style
but
pretty
good
to
drink
on
this
94
degree
day
although
it
is
not
quite
as
clean
as
a
traditional
kolsch
this
offering
is
quite
tasty
in
its
own
right
pours
a
mostly
clear
yellow
color
not
too
much
of
a
scent
with
some
grains
and
wheat
taste
is
rather
malty
while
the
texture
seems
a
little
too
thin
there
are
some
hints
of
citrus
being
my
first
kolsch
style
beer
im
not
sure
if
this
is
good
or
not
for
the
style
quite
drinkable
just
wish
there
was
some
more
volume
and
taste
to
the
beer
creamy
light
feel
a
crisp
bite
in
the
middle
dry
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
soft
grains
light
fruitiness
of
trace
bitter
orange
peel
wondering
if
thats
the
twist
mentioned
on
the
label
quenching
and
sessionable
overall
a
nice
kolsch
that
is
subtle
and
balanced
o
a
tasty
beer
on
a
scorching
summer
night
drinks
really
nicely
d
a
nice
americanmade
kölsch
that
id
happily
drink
again
seems
quite
tame
for
a
shorts
offering
but
based
on
some
of
their
recent
output
that
may
be
a
good
thing
o
excellent
brew
for
a
warm
summer
day
im
not
a
kolsch
expert
but
this
seems
relatively
true
to
style
with
a
bit
morebl
bitterness
which
seems
like
a
shorts
hallmark
also
shorts
lists
this
at
5
5
abv
which
seems
right
as
i
dont
get
any
prominent
alcohol
from
this
overall
impression
the
yeast
presence
definitely
adds
a
nice
twist
on
a
style
that
might
need
a
kick
in
the
ass
every
now
and
again
i
always
like
to
see
what
shorts
is
up
to
and
i
think
they
typically
push
boundaries
in
a
good
way
i
was
definitely
pleased
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
of
these
at
a
lake
instead
of
a
computer
cheers
o
pretty
straight
forward
especially
for
shorts
maybe
a
little
hoppier
than
some
awesome
hot
weather
beer
im
going
to
grill
some
chicken
in
a
bit
it
should
pair
nicely
with
my
second
bottle
this
could
beer
an
everyday
drinker
worthy
of
a
case
much
less
a
full
sixer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
beer
had
just
about
everything
that
this
style
is
known
for
with
just
a
slight
twist
to
let
you
know
that
this
is
a
shorts
brew
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
and
refreshing
with
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
i
could
see
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
good
warm
weather
beer
just
as
the
style
intends
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
that
is
was
very
well
rounded
and
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
but
i
do
wish
this
beer
wasnt
so
limited
my
local
beer
store
only
got
two
cases
thats
not
a
lot
when
it
comes
to
this
style
of
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
theres
any
left
when
i
go
back
its
six
pack
worthy
but
with
it
being
so
limited
it
will
not
last
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
just
a
clean
tasty
drinkable
beer
shorts
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
and
they
kept
it
pretty
traditional
but
i
did
enjoy
the
slight
citrus
aspect
that
you
dont
normally
get
in
this
style
it
was
a
nice
addition
to
this
beer
and
it
worked
well
with
the
other
flavors
this
is
now
my
favorite
kolsch
it
was
new
hollands
full
circle
but
i
find
this
beer
to
be
slightly
better
i
am
glad
you
guys
decided
to
bottle
this
beer
and
i
hope
to
see
more
of
it
next
summer
good
job
guys
this
is
another
solid
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewerys
this
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
and
only
slightly
fizzy
smell
has
a
mix
of
sour
lemon
slight
hops
and
some
sweet
honey
and
grain
taste
is
a
very
balanced
mix
between
sweet
honey
sour
lemon
and
bitter
hops
and
orange
peel
this
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
appearance
is
goldenyellow
and
not
completely
transparent
very
effervescent
bubbles
float
rather
quickly
to
the
top
a
14
finger
of
white
head
smells
bready
grassy
and
with
some
esters
refreshing
clean
with
some
fruitiness
everything
is
subtle
with
not
one
taste
overpowering
another
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
overall
i
enjoyed
the
pilsener
like
qualities
of
it
and
can
appreciate
the
slight
fruitiness
the
ale
yeast
brings
i
would
have
liked
to
see
it
more
clear
though
a
great
beer
for
summer
light
slightly
toasted
malt
up
front
clean
bready
almost
cerealy
maybe
a
touch
of
honey
herbal
peppery
spicy
hop
bitterness
arises
and
crescendos
hint
of
pine
in
the
finish
dry
and
clean
and
very
thirstquenching
on
this
hot
evening
moderate
body
with
a
crisp
feel
very
tasty
and
perfect
for
the
summer
overall
like
i
said
im
mostly
a
hophead
but
this
beer
seems
very
refreshing
the
floral
hops
come
out
at
the
right
time
got
a
growler
to
take
home
so
im
happy
kolschs
are
awesome
the
beer
appears
a
golden
yellow
and
pretty
clear
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
random
traces
of
lacing
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
brings
some
grain
malty
sweetness
and
subtle
fruit
floral
notes
the
flavor
is
quite
good
and
well
balanced
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
kolsch
i
have
had
especially
from
an
american
brewery
the
sweetness
is
there
but
i
couldnt
see
this
beer
becoming
cloying
nice
grain
and
yeast
flavors
as
well
i
could
put
away
a
liter
stein
of
this
well
done
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
good
lasting
white
head
good
retention
and
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
a
slight
bit
of
grain
plus
some
slight
floral
hops
really
good
balance
between
those
two
the
flavor
really
nails
the
grain
with
light
hop
flavor
and
smooth
hop
bitterness
light
body
and
good
carbonation
really
well
done
this
rivals
coasts
3250
as
the
best
kolsch
ive
ever
had
one
day
ill
go
to
germany
and
well
see
how
they
compare
to
the
real
stuff
wet
thin
watery
but
all
in
a
good
way
this
beer
is
a
quencher
for
sure
i
could
kill
a
keg
of
this
stuff
it
has
a
great
mildly
bitter
finish
mild
but
appropriate
sweetness
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
night
like
this
summer
beer
not
to
much
citrus
light
but
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
summer
brews
ive
tried
fairly
harsh
up
front
the
carbonation
looks
to
strip
your
tastebuds
off
your
tongue
not
like
a
west
coast
ipa
but
still
pretty
aggressive
not
what
i
want
in
a
summer
style
thats
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
rjt
very
good
lightbodied
ale
with
a
crisp
smooth
finish
i
grabbed
two
cases
of
beer
today
one
being
boulder
mojo
which
i
had
before
and
another
being
harpoon
friday
full
fridge
variety
pack
i
want
to
try
the
shandy
i
only
had
it
in
the
fridge
for
about
40
minutes
so
i
didnt
want
to
try
something
unfamiliar
and
it
be
too
warm
tried
harpoon
summer
beer
its
light
crisp
and
refreshing
o
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
one
and
im
glad
i
revisited
it
harpoon
summer
beer
what
a
good
one
i
have
drank
a
lot
of
these
they
are
refreshing
and
tasty
available
in
bottles
and
cans
it
is
a
great
goto
beer
for
the
beach
the
lake
the
park
the
backyard
cooking
in
the
kitchen
watching
popeye
in
the
living
room
sneaking
into
the
movies
walking
around
town
getting
drunk
in
a
fancy
restaurant
drinking
in
a
dive
bar
playing
foosball
hiding
out
in
a
treehouse
camping
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
anywhere
great
beer
summer
is
a
good
season
overall
too
overall
this
beer
stacks
up
well
against
the
bjcp
guidelines
for
koelsch
but
is
rather
uninspiring
im
not
sure
why
koelsch
is
somewhat
universal
for
summer
beer
in
the
us
while
it
is
certainly
a
light
style
the
strange
astringency
found
in
most
usproduced
versions
does
not
make
it
the
most
refreshing
o
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
after
mowing
a
few
acres
or
doing
some
yard
work
really
refreshing
and
definitely
not
heavy
on
the
palate
i
like
it
a
lot
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
hoppy
and
slightly
bitter
with
fruit
and
wheat
overtones
i
think
it
looked
like
a
light
lager
but
im
not
sure
since
the
restaurant
was
really
dark
not
a
bad
beer
and
ill
maybe
give
it
a
shot
if
i
come
across
it
again
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
o
this
is
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
can
see
this
being
powerfully
refreshing
after
having
been
out
in
the
hot
sun
as
a
summer
beer
i
believe
it
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
be
not
a
earthshattering
offering
but
solid
as
a
light
easy
to
drink
summer
offering
o
a
solid
kolsch
but
this
style
is
quite
light
simple
and
tame
o
surprised
im
a
tough
critic
of
summer
beers
because
they
are
usually
lacking
too
much
substance
for
me
or
are
overpowered
by
citrus
and
fruit
flavors
not
my
thing
this
is
actually
a
beer
id
want
to
drink
in
the
summer
not
necessarily
bursting
with
flavor
but
very
light
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
pale
gold
in
color
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
decent
white
frothy
head
the
body
is
semitransparent
theres
a
great
deal
maltiness
up
front
as
i
smell
it
with
lemon
peel
and
orange
rind
in
the
background
taste
is
very
similar
to
a
classic
pilsner
except
for
some
more
pronounced
herbal
and
spicy
qualities
to
the
hops
low
bitterness
crackery
malt
on
the
tongue
dry
grass
but
flavours
do
not
linger
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
overall
its
not
a
bad
thirstquencher
for
the
warmer
months
but
it
doesnt
have
any
one
quality
that
makes
it
stand
out
overall
nothing
too
great
here
its
a
little
too
bitter
with
a
bit
too
much
thickness
for
the
style
which
makes
it
not
as
refreshing
as
i
would
have
hoped
this
beer
is
average
but
fails
in
the
summer
beer
category
there
are
simply
just
better
summer
beers
out
there
a
very
good
summer
beer
that
i
would
pack
in
the
cooler
heading
to
the
beach
golf
course
etc
good
beer
the
taste
has
a
decent
upfront
pale
malt
sweetness
and
not
so
much
like
the
grains
of
a
typical
kolsch
the
sweetness
is
what
surprises
me
the
most
and
it
results
in
an
unique
approach
to
the
style
appearance
pours
a
sizable
and
fluffy
head
some
lacing
lingers
with
a
scent
of
bread
grain
and
hops
a
lot
of
people
rave
about
the
taste
of
this
one
and
my
guess
is
that
many
of
them
are
simply
happy
to
find
a
summer
beer
without
the
typical
flavors
fruit
wheat
yeast
etc
and
instead
a
beer
with
some
dryness
other
than
for
the
fact
that
it
is
a
bit
more
thin
than
beers
one
might
drink
in
the
autumn
months
theres
nothing
special
here
and
certainly
nothing
that
makes
me
think
this
is
an
ideal
beer
to
consume
during
warm
summer
months
yes
its
crisp
and
on
the
lighter
side
but
its
just
not
that
interesting
a
decent
example
of
a
kolsch
and
a
decent
summer
beerbut
not
something
i
would
consider
purchasing
again
at
9
49six
pack
overall
not
bad
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
any
german
kolsch
and
pales
compared
to
many
domestics
as
well
but
it
is
about
a
drinkable
brew
and
not
a
label
id
have
this
again
o
this
is
the
best
beer
of
the
kolsch
or
summer
light
beer
style
i
have
tasted
from
an
american
brewer
totally
lives
up
to
harpoon
name
im
going
back
for
a
case
this
is
a
summer
beer
hop
heads
could
enjoy
sessionable
notes
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
light
refreshing
easy
to
drink
a
perfect
summer
beer
o
another
fine
option
among
the
summer
seasonals
its
got
plenty
of
taste
and
enough
character
to
make
it
well
worth
working
through
a
sixpack
its
definitely
a
good
choice
for
beating
the
heat
i
like
some
of
my
texas
kolsch
options
a
bit
better
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
and
if
you
can
find
it
super
fresh
my
bet
is
youll
love
it
scent
is
slightly
sweet
and
grapefruitlike
poured
bright
yellow
body
small
very
shortlasting
white
head
spotty
lacing
on
glass
taste
is
citrus
and
wheat
with
a
slight
hop
bite
at
the
end
crisp
refreshing
exactly
as
on
the
label
i
e
a
summer
beer
cheers
o
an
easy
drinking
summer
brew
with
just
enough
aroma
and
flavor
to
entice
the
taste
buds
on
a
hot
summer
day
simplicity
aside
its
still
a
good
brew
o
it
was
over
90
out
when
i
got
home
from
work
and
popped
this
one
open
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
flavor
feel
and
even
appearance
which
remained
nicely
carbonated
all
the
way
down
were
exactly
what
i
needed
i
only
wish
i
had
another
one
highly
recommend
while
not
my
favorite
summer
seasonal
this
is
most
definitely
enjoyable
and
drinkable
if
youre
generally
a
pilsner
drinker
during
the
summer
months
and
need
a
more
alely
counterpart
check
out
harpoon
summer
beer
overall
lacks
the
taste
that
i
would
prefer
from
a
beer
like
this
the
notes
are
good
but
need
some
punch
behind
them
i
know
that
this
beer
should
not
be
oozing
with
flavor
but
you
can
do
better
than
this
still
not
a
bad
beer
worth
a
go
o
not
my
preference
for
a
summer
seasonal
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
less
soft
and
more
astringent
than
a
traditional
kölsch
higher
hop
bitterness
good
body
and
carbonation

cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
as
expected
medium
carbonation

with

very
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
kolsch
nice
flavor
balance
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
pleasantly
enjoyable
offering
overall
a
nondescript
benign
beer
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissapeared
the
smell
of
lemon
with
some
malt
to
it
not
very
strong
though
the
taste
has
a
faint
lemon
taste
upfront
followed
by
a
nice
peppery
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
smooth
not
to
overly
carbonated
over
all
this
is
a
average
kolsch
but
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
one
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head
that
falls
off
rather
quickly
the
nose
is
rather
nondescript
but
entirely
serviceable
light
doughy
malt
mild
lemony
hops
maybe
a
touch
of
fruity
yeast
character
while
all
the
right
flavor
notes
are
present
this
just
doesnt
have
the
right
combination
this
is
mirrored
on
the
palate
where
the
same
flavors
but
the
same
lack
of
definition
is
present
along
with
a
faint
buttery
note
light
in
body
crisply
carbonated
and
dry
and
refreshing
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
nice
worthy
even
but
not
all
that
it
could
be
recommended
o
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
make
up
of
the
german
style
kolsch
more
flavorful
than
a
lot
of
summer
beers
i
have
had
harpoon
is
something
special
out
of
boston
and
comes
out
with
a
quality
beer
every
time
o
not
a
bad
summer
seasonal
very
easy
drinking
and
makes
for
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
hot
weather
and
bbq
o
goes
down
easy
but
i
have
definitely
had
more
enjoyable
examples
of
the
style
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
taste
carries
some
lemon
as
well
as
fruitiness
some
biscuit
and
malt
present
as
well
mouth
feel
is
fairly
crisp
and
refreshing
o
from
the
first
time
i
tried
the
harpoon
summer
beer
this
summer
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
styles
to
drink
it
has
a
great
balance
between
complex
and
interesting
taste
and
that
refreshing
kick
that
we
all
love
on
a
hot
day
just
a
great
beer
to
session
during
these
absurdly
hot
summer
days
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
theres
a
fruity
lemony
aspect
to
this
beer
that
sets
it
a
bit
above
the
average
summer
beer
worth
checking
out
if
you
want
something
light
12oz
can
served
in
a
standard
pint
pours
a
bright
straw
gold
with
a
translucent
clarity
and
a
one
inch
bright
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
into
a
solid
soapy
slick
some
thin
clusters
of
lacing
are
evident
during
the
tasting
nose
is
very
clean
just
the
merest
suggestion
of
wheat
and
citrus
taste
reveals
light
toasted
wheat
mild
citrus
notes
and
a
slight
buttery
quality
that
nicely
intermingles
before
culminating
in
a
fairly
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
an
even
carbonation
that
adds
just
a
little
additional
depth
to
the
consistency
overall
i
know
this
may
not
be
the
best
most
style
consistent
kolsch
out
there
but
i
love
this
beer
in
the
summer
and
really
think
the
canned
version
is
far
superior
to
the
bottle
this
is
one
of
my
summer
staples
o
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
summer
brews
especially
out
of
the
can
it
really
just
screams
summer
to
me
infinitely
sessionable
and
delicious
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
summer
beer
from
harpoon
perfect
for
the
hot
summer
days
and
drinking
in
mass
quantities
mellow
easy
drinking
beer
and
would
go
just
fine
with
steak
and
shrimp
fajitas
nice
little
summer
beer

this
is
a
very
refreshing
easy
drinking
clean
crisp
summer
beer
its
a
well
brewed
kolsch
that
drinks
nicely
on
these
hot
summer
days
ill
definitely
have
another
the
flavor
is
very
refreshing
and
balanced
in
the
best
way
possible
the
taste
has
a
nice
floral
hop
which
is
almost
tealike
in
the
foreground
with
slight
toasted
malt
presence
with
some
gentle
sweet
elements
that
move
more
toward
yeast
flavors
which
seem
like
light
grape
or
golden
pear
in
the
finish
with
some
of
the
herbal
hops
and
spice
flavors
lingering
after
the
swallow
this
is
a
good
beer
to
call
summer
beer
it
is
interesting
flavorful
and
quaffable
yet
not
an
ideal
kolsch
in
the
traditional
sense
it
is
a
very
good
american
interpretation
of
the
style
i
will
certainly
have
to
find
this
on
tap
sometime
soon
a
perfect
summer
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
trader
joes
in
washington
dc
price

feels
just
what
it
should
be
refreshing
and
not
too
sweet
its
got
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
just
what
id
hoped
for
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
its
got
a
very
fresh
taste
to
boot
great
sessioner
and
a
great
effort
from
harpoon
o
this
is
actually
a
very
good
summer
beer
ive
had
several
of
these
before
i
decided
to
give
a
it
a
review
so
i
could
be
as
fair
as
possible
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
i
wasnt
actually
expecting
it
to
be
this
good
this
may
be
my
favorite
by
harpoon
well
done
o
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
this
beer
but
i
am
a
lemon
fan
so
i
kind
of
like
it
it
is
refreshing
and
would
probably
be
even
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
a
whole
6pack
of
this
but
its
not
too
bad
as
its
name
implies
harpoon
summer
beer
is
a
good
summer
thirst
quencher
as
a
kolsch
should
be
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
from
now
on
this
will
be
a
summertime
staple
for
me
i
just
wish
id
discovered
it
earlier
in
the
season
a
light
bodied
beer
with
some
noticeable
carbonation
and
a
light
dry
citrusy
aftertaste
another
one
of
those
beer
that
a
six
pack
could
disappear
pretty
quick
on
a
hot
summers
day
oa
decent
summer
beer
light
and
sessionable
just
was
glad
that
the
lemon
did
not
taste
artificial
like
other
harpoon
beers
im
talking
to
you
crystal
wheat
overalla
very
successful
kolsch
easy
to
drink
all
the
factors
add
up
to
a
success
and
i
would
drink
this
again
a
great
first
try
for
this
beer
style
o
not
too
bad
but
not
going
to
medal
too
much
with
this
guy
a
little
warming
helps
this
guy
out
some
but
dont
expect
a
lot
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
m
lightbodied
pleasant
very
sessionable
the
type
of
beer
for
a
midday
in
summer
pours
thin
pale
yellow
with
a
small
bubbly
head
that
slimes
on
the
glass
looks
very
kolschy
grainy
floral
nice
malt
characters
lemony
with
a
nice
touch
of
spice
on
the
nose
nice
rich
buttery
malt
taste
with
citrus
blend
and
a
grainy
finish
light
and
sticky
on
the
feel
bitter
crisp
refreshing
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
that
would
be
worth
buying
for
a
long
day
in
the
sun
o
while
not
my
favorite
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
recommended
if
you
like
the
style
or
are
looking
for
a
good
summer
beer
overall
i
would
happy
buy
this
again
since
its
not
only
cheap
around
10
bucks
a
sixer
but
very
drinkable
a
case
might
even
be
cheaper
so
i
may
need
to
check
pricing
d
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
that
is
ok
to
serve
to
newbies
to
the
craft
beer
scene
yet
drinkable
for
all
who
look
for
a
easy
drinking
summer
beer
on
a
hot
day
o
i
just
dont
like
kölsches
not
recommended
o
to
be
fair
kölsch
is
one
of
my
least
favourite
styles
strong
for
the
style
and
not
the
worst
example
ive
consumed
arguably
better
than
many
found
in
köln
still
i
will
not
have
again
not
recommended
still
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
maybe
it
is
nighttime
and
not
that
warm
im
drainpouring
it
beer
poured
very
bright
and
lively
into
my
pint
glass
color
was
a
clear
pale
yellow
medium
white
head
smell
was
intriguing
mildly
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
and
a
hint
of
white
grape
juice
the
taste
was
mildly
sweet
with
medium
hop
bitterness
again
a
touch
of
fruitiness
finish
is
grassy
hops
the
only
negative
was
a
very
slight
metallic
taste
on
the
late
finish
mouthfeel
was
lively
with
medium
carbonation
lighttomedium
body
overall
a
nice
beer
light
and
tasty
with
a
nice
blend
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
great
with
light
summer
fare
this
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
i
love
how
it
can
be
light
and
refreshing
while
maintaining
character
and
depth
of
flavor
this
is
canned
sunshine
this
has
become
a
summer
regular
for
me
o
i
try
tailor
my
reviews
to
be
somewhat
to
style
and
this
is
what
ive
done
here
while
not
an
overall
great
beer
in
my
eyes
in
terms
of
enjoyment
it
is
great
for
what
it
is
a
light
crisp
refreshing
summer
beer
the
heat
index
in
nashville
today
is
107
and
this
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
overall
i
was
excited
about
this
one
up
until
the
taste
it
was
a
little
watered
down
for
me
not
so
much
bad
tasting
as
the
grain
and
malt
with
lemon
notes
were
solid
in
the
aftertaste
the
typical
summer
ale
taste
and
was
not
very
bitter
and
very
refreshing
nice
refreshing
beer
here
nothing
earthshattering
but
flavorful
and
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
it
actually
may
be
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
content
while
not
detectable
is
definitely
a
little
on
the
high
side
and
hurts
the
drinkability
still
a
decent
choice
for
a
summer
quaffer
recommended
overall
this
beer
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
the
yella
pils
by
oskar
blues
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
summer
beers
ive
had
and
is
extremely
drinkable
im
happy
i
tried
it
and
i
would
buy
it
again
t
excellent
refreshing
qualities
and
light
body
makes
an
excellent
summer
quencher
flavour
profile
is
simple
but
kolsch
was
never
meant
to
be
complex
very
good
o
there
is
really
nothing
special
with
this
beer
a
average
kolsch
in
a
land
of
bland
kolsch
styles
sorry
harpoon
but
this
is
average
and
therefore
not
seeking
this
one
out
again
anytime
soon
overall
a
decent
summer
drinker
inoffensive
and
refreshing
but
wont
overwhelm
you
with
flavor
crystal
clear
strawlemon
yellow
with
a
thin
cap
of
bright
white
foam
good
head
retention
lots
of
streaky
lacing
looks
nice
the
aroma
was
a
bit
fruity
almost
entirely
like
green
grapes
but
with
mild
malts
underneath
and
a
faint
hop
spiciness
moderate
to
low
bitterness
that
played
nicely
against
the
malty
flavours
spicy
hops
and
very
mild
grape
flavour
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
offdry
decent
texture
pretty
tasty
for
a
summertime
beer
clear
and
yellow
a
couple
fingers
of
soapy
head
a
lot
of
bubbles
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
slight
sour

with
a
pale

backing
taste
is
a
lot
of
the
pale
crisp
malt
with
some
lemon
zest
and
noble
hops
body
is
light
and
refreshing
at
first
but
there
is
a
lingering
sour
lemon
bitterness
drinkability
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
and
a
great
summer
seasonal
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
find
it
o
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
tasty
light
and
extremely
portable
its
sold
in
6
packs
as
well
as
12
packs
in
cans
this
will
be
my
go
to
summer
beer
for
any
partiesoutside
events
golden
beer
with
a
fluffy
head
that
dissolves
quickly
crisp
sweet
citrus
aroma
with
some
malty
notes
sweet
lemon
and
crisp
grass
flavors
this
would
be
a
great
one
to
drink
on
a
sweaty
summer
day
it
hits
the
spot
just
like
a
cold
glass
of
lemonade
overall
this
isnt
a
ride
home
and
tell
dad
kind
of
beer
but
it
offers
a
very
good
overall
taste
and
light
fare
could
easily
drink
a
few
dozen
of
these
just
based
on
how
fresh
it
is
mouthfeel
nicely
carbonated
smooth
and
crisp
pretty
plain
jane
but
refreshing
summer
beer
its
a
pale
yellow
with
creamy
white
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
nice
lace
the
smell
is
bready
with
faint
floral
and
lemon
notes
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
bready
cracker
like
malts
followed
with
a
touch
of
floral
and
lemon
zest
watery
smooth
crisp
refreshing
great
summer
beer
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
little
disappointed
but
still
not
bad
nice
for
summer
which
is
their
goal
right
d
very
drinkable
smooth
and
refreshing
everything
seems
balanced
enough
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
too
much
bready
flavor
that
knocks
off
the
balance
a
bit
overall
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
there
is
not
much
going
on
in
this
beer
not
impressive
at
all
which
is
not
what
a
well
done
kolsch
should
be
imo
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
summer
beers
ive
tasted
i
may
actually
get
these
next
time
i
drink
outside
d
moderate
its
a
nice
summer
beer
and
i
would
love
it
at
a
barbeque
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
its
crosstown
rival
in
sam
adams
summer
ale
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
quite
sessionable
given
its
low
alcohol
content
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
most
certainly
a
lawnmower
beer
could
see
myself
drinking
these
all
afternoon
no
problem
d
easy
to
drink
for
sure
just
theres
not
anything
really
going
on
here
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
very
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
nice
longlasting
white
head
that
leaves
just
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
is
pretty
clean
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
grain
mild
fruit
and
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
mostly
grain
but
there
is
a
bit
of
light
lemon
and
orange
clean
and
crisp
this
drinks
pretty
well
but
doesnt
hit
on
the
subtle
complexities
of
the
better
versions
of
this
style
linger
2
this
is
an
excellent
summer
brew
im
going
to
go
clear
out
the
stock
of
my
local
store
tomorrow
since
its
still
going
over
90
degrees
here
in
florida
drink
well
my
friends
great
drinkability
a
very
good
take
on
a
under
appreciated
style
had
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
and
then
a
couple
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
maybe
its
not
the
appropriate
glassware
but
its
a
cool
glass
pale
straw
yellow
not
quite
golden
as
ive
seen
in
other
kolsch
smells
of
yeast
citrus
and
a
hint
of
household
cleaner
the
taste
is
what
i
would
describe
as
clean
maybe
this
comes
from
the
idea
that
it
smells
like
cleaning
product
but
the
fruity
taste
dominates
there
might
be
some
hop
bite
on
the
back
end
of
a
swig
but
it
really
is
dulled
very
refreshing
but
not
substantial
pleasing
but
not
memorable
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
very
good
lots
of
carbonation
and
the
5
5
abv
which
is
a
bit
more
than
your
typical
summer
beer
i
guess
doesnt
really
set
in
till
youve
had
a
number
of
these
brews
probably
one
of
my
favorite
lighter
summer
beers
one
to
enjoy
if
you
are
going
to
be
having
quite
a
few
over
a
long
period
of
time
a
good
day
drinking
beer
as
well
as
it
wont
fill
you
up
or
put
you
down
early
a
clear
bright
golden
color
with
a
very
good
sized
frothy
white
head
that
clings
solidly
to
lace
the
glass
nicely
as
you
go
the
nose
detects
crisp
citrus
wheat
and
tart
yeast
not
bad
for
the
style
the
flavor
brings
on
a
bit
of
a
malty
yeast
and
more
of
that
citrus
wheat
crispness
although
it
is
relatively
light
and
refreshing
as
one
would
hope
and
expect
i
am
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
full
feel
that
washes
over
the
tongue
frothy
and
sort
of
stick
to
your
ribs
as
summer
ales
go
it
has
a
little
bite
of
tartness
and
settles
pretty
nicely
into
a
bready
mouthful
with
lemonherbal
hop
highlights
not
sweet
but
highly
drinkable
as
one
might
hope
not
always
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
favorable
acquaintance
very
sessionable
in
my
book
d
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
light
and
refreshing
a
good
summertime
beer
pours
light
yellow
with
a
very
white
head
not
much
retention
or
lacing
aroma
is
pleasant
pretty
strong
lemon
grass
hay
and
pine
notes
taste
follows
but
is
much
weaker
than
the
aroma
very
light
grassy
flavor
a
bit
of
lemon
grain
and
sweet
malt
as
you
get
into
the
beer
some
grassy
and
pine
hops
but
nothing
major
very
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
light
golden
color
with
no
apparent
head
the
aromas
were
of
appropriately
mild
for
a
beer
this
style
and
tended
toward
yeasts
and
grains
likewise
the
flavors
were
mild
yeasty
and
grainy
with
decent
carbonation
making
for
a
very
refreshing
drink
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
in
this
style
taste
is
pretty
simple
which
i
cant
really
fault
it
for
by
style
starts
citrusy
with
mildly
tart
lemon
leading
the
way
and
dominating
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
has
a
good
grainy
profile
on
the
back
along
with
a
lightly
hopped
bitterness
that
finishes
the
beer
off
pretty
cleanly
a
little
grain
hangs
around
refreshing
and
drinkable
nothing
fancy
but
hardly
anything
with
summer
in
the
title
ever
is
really
meant
to
be
this
would
be
very
good
on
a
hot
day
my
father
had
a
pint
of
the
same
brew
from
a
tap
pour
at
the
same
time
that
i
was
drinking
my
casked
version
it
was
very
interesting
to
compare
them
sidebyside
the
tapped
brew
was
predictably
more
carbonated
clear
and
crisp
the
flavors
were
more
sharp
and
identifiable
more
lemon
and
skunk
compared
to
the
rounded
and
smooth
cask
flavors
i
know
thats
whats
supposed
to
happen
but
it
was
really
cool
to
experience
it
myself
so
clearly
i
felt
insulted
with
this
one
im
not
one
to
be
snooty
about
my
beers
so
that
says
something
it
made
me
realize
theres
a
problem
with
the
perception
of
what
a
summer
beer
should
be
just
because
its
summer
does
it
mean
we
need
watery
flavorless
beers
to
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
if
i
want
water
then
ill
drink
water
imo
this
beer
has
no
personality
and
does
no
justice
to
the
kolsch
style
m
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slight
bitter
dry
finish
really
nice
light
summer
beer
that
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
extremely
light
flows
down
easy
and
is
very
refreshing
a
great
session
beer
could
drink
these
all
night
its
pretty
drinkable
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
something
about
just
didnt
make
me
want
to
grab
another
perhaps
i
will
try
another
kölsch
except
maybe
this
time
from
germany
very
nice
summer
beer
tasty
very
drinkable
one
of
the
lighter
summer
brews
i
have
come
across
but
certainly
flavorful
pours
ultraclear
light
golden
with
a
tall
white
head
that
soon
receds
and
laces
down
the
glass
nice
carbonation
trails
smell
is
decent
toasty
malts
with
a
hint
of
bitters
taste
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
mineral
but
eases
into
that
good
kolsch
mix
of
sweet
clean
malts
and
a
good
dash
of
noble
hops
good
complexity
and
mouthfeel
definitely
carbed
well
and
sits
dry
and
well
for
another
taste
easy
to
drink
very
nice
beer
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
hops
slightly
sweet
taste
is
crisp
a
bit
of
hops
and
grains
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
good
quality
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
1
inch
head
dissipates
quickly
into
a
nice
lacing
looks
like
a
pale
lager
but
once
it
hits
the
nose
and
tongue
you
know
its
something
different
citrus
on
the
nose
somewhat
bready
too
hops
are
very
minimal
sweet
on
the
tongue
now
you
know
youre
drinking
an
ale
instead
with
a
very
low
ibu
bitterness
is
very
subtle
almost
invisible
very
crisp
finish
extremely
drinkable
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
a
kolsch
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
a
12pack
at
shaws
in
windham
nh
bottle
says

not
a
big
seller
at
this
store
methinks
pours
a
strawyellow
body
with
nearly
an
inch
of
whiteish
head
smells
fruity
lemon
in
particular
comes
to
mind
with
some
spice
vanilla
and
floral
notes
lemon
and
pulp
hit
the
palate
initially
with
some
restrained
floral
and
spice
notes
and
a
mostly
clean
finish
light
and
effervescent
in
nature
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
on
a
90
degree
day
like
today
a
great
summer
seasonal
simple
and
balanced
but
with
a
little
complexity
to
keep
things
interesting
drinkable
but
not
boring
stands
out
among
the
american
pale
wheat
ales
and
blonde
ales
that
flood
the
market
this
time
of
year
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
it
never
disappoints
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
i
wish
this
beer
was
year
around
like
the
fellows
who
brews
it
can
get
it
makes
me
want
to
move
there
all
jokes
aside
let
me
know
if
there
hiring
d
light
refreshing
flavorful
without
being
overbearing
fruity
without
the
fruit
smells
nice
and
tastes
good
enough
to
call
it
enjoyable
feel
is
definitely
the
low
point
with
this
one
but
the
other
qualities
pick
up
the
slack
making
this
one
damn
drinkable
and
decent
example
of
a
kolsch
taste
has
a
snappy
crisp
grain
flavor
and
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
there
was
a
little
bit
of
wheat
in
here
yeast
is
pretty
nice
for
the
style
and
adds
some
much
needed
depth
hop
bitterness
finally
makes
an
appearance
and
even
leaves
a
decent
grassy
lingering
effect
certainly
wont
challenge
for
best
kolsch
but
is
a
pretty
good
summer
seasonal
and
infinitely
better
than
the
atrocity
that
is
harpoons
crystal
wheat
d
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
definitely
up
there
on
the
summer
seasonals
super
drinkable
and
refreshing
especially
out
of
the
can
its
a
great
beer
to
take
with
ya
on
all
your
outdoor
summer
adventures
my
initial
pour
garnered
me
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
like
liquid
sunshine
a
bright
golden
yellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
man
if
you
are
going
to
make
a
lagerstyle
beer
which
kolsch
is
it
had
better
have
this
kind
of
clarity
nose
had
a
grassy
hoppiness
just
right
for
the
style
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
very
grassy
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
bonedry
just
the
way
i
like
my
kolschs
phew
gad
but
this
was
extra
dry
like
ginger
ale
or
antiperspirant
now
im
starting
to
sweat
in
an
odd
turn
of
events
more
dang
right
cooler
heck
yes
this
was
really
really
good
in
a
way
that
the
bottled
version
cannot
match
i
love
this
beer
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yes
i
definitely
will
be
getting
a
12pack
for
this
weekends
camping
trip
up
in
vermont
i
love
to
take
this
one
out
onto
the
porch
with
a
good
book
about
midday
be
careful
though
the
smoothness
allows
it
to
creep
up
on
you
and
make
you
want
way
more
than
you
need
to
have
enjoy
d
really
drinkable
its
got
a
nice
flavor
and
is
a
good
summer
sipper
not
something
for
hopheads
but
there
is
no
hint
of
alcohol
and
you
could
put
a
bunch
back
on
a
fine
summer
day
a
decent
example
of
the
style
pale
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
not
much
lace
i
havent
much
to
say
about
the
appearance
other
than
it
looks
very
much
like
a
macro
lager
with
a
better
retaining
head
sweet
grains
and
a
musky
hoppiness
with
a
touch
of
earth
taste
gives
the
same
but
a
bit
more
pronounced
and
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
as
well
pretty
good
harpoon
summer
does
a
great
job
for
the
season
especially
now
that
they
are
in
cans
the
12
pack
didnt
last
long
in
the
fridge
and
ill
probably
pick
up
another
one
sometime
this
summer
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
with
a
large
superfrothy
white
head
on
top
great
retention
left
some
light
globs
of
lace
behind
scents
of
tart
lemon
zest
freshcut
grass
and
whiffs
of
cheap
pinescent
not
bad
the
body
is
pretty
refreshing
and
crisp
its
got
some
thin
notes
to
it
but
overall
decent
body
the
flavors
are
pretty
mellow
and
tame
some
grassy
notes
a
little
citrus
a
light
hop
finish
this
was
a
very
refreshing
simple
beer
i
could
see
this
being
a
regular
this
summer
feel
is
smooth
and
stylistic
summer
is
here
no
better
time
to
imbibe
summer
brews
picked
up
a
six
of
this
at
tw
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
yields
a
dry
malty
smell
slightly
floral
in
a
garden
sort
of
way
pours
into
a
pint
glass
it
yields
a
bright
yellow
colour
with
a
big
foamy
multi
size
bubble
head
with
a
creamy
top
taste
is
slightly
citrusyl
bittersweet
and
very
dry
what
bitterness
there
is
is
in
the
finish
it
is
more
puckering
then
bitter
and
finishes
super
dry
this
is
a
good
brew
for
summer
excepting
for
the
dry
finish
which
really
detracts
from
being
a
good
thirst
quencher
good
brew
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
summer
per
se
id
brew
it
year
round
and
call
it
a
kolsch
12
ounce
bottle
from
a
friends
12
bottle
sampler
box
best
by
dating
etched
onto
the
neck
of
the
bottle
pours
very
clear
and
very
pale
moderate
height
on
the
near
white
head
that
leaves
just
a
few
bits
of
spotty
fine
lace
grassy
nose
of
lite
hops
crisp
brew
with
some
lime
more
grassy
hops
and
a
moderately
zesty
finish
lite
and
refreshing
nothing
astonishing
but
a
decent
brew
for
a
warm
summers
day
not
that
i
dont
like
this
beer
i
actually
think
it
can
grow
on
me
i
also
never
had
this
style
before
the
taste
is
nice
and
refreshing
because
it
has
a
nice
medium
hop
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
easy
drinking
my
first
overall
impression
was
that
it
isnt
anything
special
but
its
slowly
growing
on
me
as
i
finish
the
glass
d
sure
its
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
gonna
be
having
this
beer
again
theres
absolutely
no
substance
here
no
taste
no
nose
and
the
feel
is
as
thin
as
water
dont
waste
your
time
with
this
one
in
an
effort
to
rate
beer
by
style
i
must
confess
that
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
with
that
being
said
i
will
say
that
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
it
is
light
pale
yellow
with
a
mellow
flavor
i
could
see
a
pitcher
of
this
beer
with
a
plate
of
hot
wings
it
is
light
and
almost
fruity
a
thirst
quencher
possibly
best
way
to
enjoy
is
with
oysters
clams
lobster
you
get
the
picture
harpoon
summer
beer
poured
yellow
with
a
decent
size
head
it
had
a
slightly
bitter
smell
and
there
were
also
citrus
smells
present
as
well
it
taste
refreshing
it
was
kinda
of
hoppy
and
had
a
lemon
taste
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
overall
not
bad
very
similair
to
other
harpoon
beers
straw
golden
color
clear
thin
white
head
couldnt
agree
more
with
recent
reviews
that
said
it
looks
like
a
macro
this
beer
is
only
moderately
better
than
macros
faint
hops
lemon
grass
smell
and
taste
too
watery
for
my
liking
even
for
a
summer
easy
to
drink
but
no
reason
to
drink
much
of
these
light
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
looks
like
a
macro
aroma
is
faint
citrus
taste
is
also
citrus
and
malts
very
simple
light
and
refreshing
just
like
a
summer
ale
should
be
i
would
recommend
especially
in
the
summer
months
i
also
would
purchase
again
in
the
summer
months
12
head
some
lacing
very
clear
pale
amber
gold
color
not
much
in
the
smell
some
citrus
fruits
and
hops
same
with
the
taste
a
little
too
watery
not
very
full
flavored
reminds
me
of
some
macros
this
beer
didnt
impress
me
theres
a
lot
of
beeter
summer
beers
out
there
to
get
d
good
drink
ability
but
kind
of
boring
for
my
tastes
this
beer
pours
a
clean
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
aroma
is
a
basic
malt
lager
scent
the
taste
is
quite
good
clean
crisp
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
hops
fairly
dry
tasting
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
better
than
many
of
the
summer
macro
lagers
so
frequently
offered
up
a
barbeques
and
picnics
drinkability
well
i
could
probably
sit
around
and
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
sure
that
i
would
though
assuming
other
selections
were
available
next
summer
if
i
see
it
around
ill
probably
buy
it
but
its
not
in
any
danger
of
becoming
a
regular
in
my
rotation
probably
because
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
to
begin
with
bottom
line
if
you
enjoy
a
kolsch
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
one
will
scratch
you
where
you
itch
mouth
feel
is
light
and
crisp
with
prickly
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
drink
on
a
hot
day
outside
thus
the
name
summer
beer
i
would
assume
this
beers
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
smallish
head
to
it
that
kind
of
sticks
around
along
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
to
it
not
a
great
smell
to
it
get
almost
an
adjunctlager
sort
of
smell
to
this
one
taste
is
much
better
though
nice
mouthfeel
and
body
to
this
one
nothing
too
crazy
in
the
flavor
department
just
some
slight
hop
crispiness
and
a
bit
of
some
lemoncitrus
zest
in
there
not
of
the
most
exciting
styles
out
there
but
definitely
better
than
the
average
summer
seasonal
out
there
actually
a
very
good
american
representation
of
a
kolsch
perfect
summer
beer
as
well
one
of
my
favorites
sampled
harpoon
this
beer
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
singlefinger
head
and
some
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
some
light
with
a
solid
malt
background
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
malt
that
is
countered
well
by
the
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
with
some
moderate
carbonation
kölshes
are
an
excellent
choice
to
market
as
a
summer
beer
and
harpoons
made
a
solid
one
thats
great
on
a
hot
day
surprisingly
good
and
a
wellcrafted
kolsch
da
nice
light
bodied
kolsch
not
quite
as
good
as
those
from
koln
but
good
to
have
on
a
summer
day
they
got
the
name
of
this
one
right
it
is
a
great
summer
beer
that
you
can
drink
all
day
long
its
not
earth
shattering
but
it
has
just
enough
going
for
it
to
keep
you
interested
pours
a
clear
lemon
yellow
with
a
full
inch

inviting
smell
is
malty
with
a
a
grapelike
nose
also
taste
is
a
very
nice
light
malt
with
a
smooth
quality
and
a
continuation
of
the
grape
notes
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
very
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
easily

filtered

amount
of

retention
doesnt
really
smell
like
much
though
some
pale
malt
a
touch
of
hop
snap
taste
is
a
very
clean
summer
beer
slightly
malty
slightly
dry
a
bit
of
bite
on
it
from
hops
more
than
youd
think
given
the
appearance
decent
mouthfeel
for
something
so
light
and
very
drinkable
for
the
summer
months
a
step
above
the
standard
wheat
beer
everyone
does
for
the
summer
if
nothing
spectacular
d
a
summer
beer
i
could
drink
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
it
was
pretty
refreshing
quenching
although
i
thought
it
was
slightly
thin
all
in
all
a
decent
sessionable
beer
for
when
under
the
sun
not
my
case
right
now
this
is
an
amazingly
clear
golden
the
foam
stands
around
forever
quite
impressive
this
is
my
first
kolch
and
i
like
what
i
see
the
smell
is
soft
lemon
zest
and
other
grains
coming
from
a
foamy
head
that
sticks
for
a
while
tastes
really
refreshing
and
pounds
away
at
the
grains
in
this
one
although
the
slight
lemon
taste
comes
through
a
bit
at
the
beginning
mf
is
very
light
just
like
a
lager
or
a
light
one
eqyally
crisp

a

very
dry

great
to

after

eaty
notes
to
the
middle
of
the
palate
very
light
fruits
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
this
is
a
nicely
carbonated
and
crisp
kolsch
insanely
drinkable
must
try
on
tap
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
a
pretty
good
kolsch
nice
for
a
summer
beer
its
a
good
brew
that
i
would
certainly
revisit
d
nice
light
summer
beer
good
for
hot
days
and
chilling
a
solid

session
brew
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
the
summer
seasonal
id
turn
to
covers
all
the
bases
of
the
summer
seasonal
style
great
for
a
party
probably
a
crowd
pleaser
not
bad
overall
just
not
exactly
what
i
would
look
for
in
a
lawnmower
beer
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
good
beer
for
the
beach
pours
a
clear
clean
golden
hue
very
little
head
if
any
and
just
a
ring
of
lacing
hangs
around
aroma
is
not
strong
but
there
is
a
bit
of
straw
and
sweetness
taste
is
short
and
sweet
sort
of
starts
of
with
some
malt
tartness
but
finishes
with
some
type
of
fruit
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
clean
and
somewhat
refreshing
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
but
a
good
summer
beer
go
figure
pours
a
light
gold
body
with
decent
head
that
dies
quickly

is
marginal
dark

hops
and
some
minor
sweet

has
a
rather
nondecript
fruit
taste
and
is
somewhat
slick
and
watery
w
a
light
body
also
some
residual

from
the

it
go
down

on

nothing
more

highly
drinkable
and

a
bjcp
commercial
example
verdict
harpoons
summer
beer
is
a
straightforward
light
and
easydrinking
beer
that
makes
for
a
great
summer
seasonal
if
you
had
told
me
this
was
a
pilsener
i
dont
think
i
would
have
questioned
you
but
thats
rather
acceptable
for
kölsches
d
excellent
overall
harpoon
nailed
the
style
overall
ive
never
had
a
really
light
beer
before
designed
to
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
that
didnt
taste
like
crap
harpoon
accomplished
the
goal
of
making
a
highly
drinkable
summer
session
beer
just
dont
expect
great
flavor
the
sam
adams
summer
ale
is
definitely
preferable
imo
d
its
an
ok
representation
of
the
style
but
definitely
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
ones
i
had
in
germany
worth
trying
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
any
more
can
see
why
this
is
sometimes
compared
to
macro
as
previously
stated
in
a
couple
of
other
reviews
but
this
is
more
what
they
should
taste
like
but
they
dont
another
good
beer
from
harpoon
this
one
fine
kolsch
another
top
notch
brew
for
the
hot
summer
months
flavor
is
okay
a
little
more
hoppy
and
less
malty
than
other
kölsches
bit
of
lemon
not
enough
nutty
or
biscuity
malt
flavor
but
i
like
the
bitterness
and
okay
hop
flavor
which
is
reminiscent
of
a
weak
harpoon
ipa
needs
more
body
pretty
light
carbonation
not
over
the
top
overall
its
inoffensive
and
light
so
drinkability
is
high
d
not
bad
for
a
summer
beer
a
few
cold
bottlesglasses
would
be
nice
on
a
warm
day
but
other
than
that
i
find
this
a
somewhat
average
offering
from
harpoon
d
highly
drinkable
but
if
im
drinking
a
kolsch
i
prefer
the
saint
arnold
lawnmower
d
a
very
nice
summer
seasonal
from
harpoon
this
would
be
easy
to
drink
several
of
on
a
hot
summer
evening
not
necessarily
fantastic
but
very
wellexecuted
pretty
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
harpoon
for
sure
d
easy
to
drink
very
clean
light
flavors
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
would
probably
be
perfect
straight
out
of
the
bottle
during
a
tailgatingoutdoor
event
worth
a
shot
tastes
like
it
smells
with
crisp
light
grain
and
lemony
noble
hop
zest
buttery
harpoon
yeast
all
over
a
refreshing
summer
beer
d
a
pretty
good
thirstquencher
im
glad
i
decided
to
give
this
a
try
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
a
good
summer
beer
and
would
pair
well
with
a
good
hamburger
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
could
drink
12
of
these
on
my
own
on
a
nice
summer
afternoon
nice
effort
by
harpoon
drinkability
overall
very
drinkable
crisp
refreshing
beer
it
is
prefect
for
those
hot
summer
days
so
it
definitely
lives
up
to
its
title

d
not
my
cup
of
tea
feels
a
bit
dry
but
nice
body
overall
its
actually
a
beer
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
a
good
summery
kolsch
d
a
decent
brew
i
dont
at
all
care
for
the
weird
late
palate
flavor
so
this
brew
loses
some
points
for
that
all
in
all
easy
to
drink
with
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
if
somewhat
attenuated
harpoon
summer
beer
pours
a
very
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
grainy
with
a
hint
of
lemon
the
flavor
is
pleasantly
grainy
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
no
real
hop
flavor
there
is
a
hint
of
citrus
but
its
mild
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
d
hey
its
a
summer
beer
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
has
more
heft
than
your
traditional
kolsch
very
drinkable
and
the
best
ive
had
from
harpoon
finally
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
i
have
found
a
few
that
i
liked
but
for
the
most
part
they
seem
to
be
rather
bland
nice
to
see
this
one
actually
has
some
flavor
the
aroma
was
lemon
and
wheaty
golden
color
topped
with
a
small
white
head
but
surprisingly
left
quite
a
bit
of
lace
the
flavor
was
simple
but
good
with
citrus
flavors
some
spice
and
hops
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
medium
sweet
malt
with
the
distinctive
kolsch
style
yeast
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
medium
sweet
malt
with
some
unrefined
grainy
notes
and
the
distinctive
kolsch
style
yeast
that
i
have
a
hard
time
to
describe
well
done
and
very
refreshing
poured
off
the
tap
at
their
tasting
room
in
nowhere
vermont
nice
white
head
on
the
top
but
it
didnt
last
long
good
lacing
though
color
was
a
pale
yellow
and
the
aroma
was
fairly
hoppy
much
like
an
american
pilsner
with
hints
of
lemongrass
the
flavors
were
more
kolschlike
with
floral
hops
lemon
zest
and
an
herbaceous
quality
the
bitterness
at
the
end
is
distinct
and
gives
it
a
crisp
finish
quite
dry
not
bad
but
not
great
not
the
best
summer
beer
but
a
decent
representation
of
a
relatively
obscure
style
its
been
replicated
a
lot
for
summer
but
id
like
to
see
harpoon
flex
its
muscles
on
a
really
great
kolsch
in
the
100
barrel
series
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
just
ok
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
do
much
to
separate
itself
from
other
summer
beers
nothing
to
see
here
move
along
the
beer
poured
with
a
clear
golden
color
with
somewhat
creamy
lacing
on
the
sides
but
a
generally
thin
head
aromas
were
a
bit
thin
but
had
a
nice
touch
of
summery
aromas
including
some
apple
peach
pear
mixed
with
hops
taste
had
that
typical
dry
bitterness
but
it
was
light
and
watery
enough
to
make
this
a
relaxing
summer
drink
a
slight
carbonated
punch
at
the
end
of
every
sip
i
could
picture
myself
out
on
the
deck
of
some
restaurant
drinking
this
with
a
nice
meal
if
only
this
new
england
summer
did
not
suck
ah
well
overall
a
refreshing
drink
from
harpoon
not
a
very
good
beer
this
is
my
second
from
harpoon
i
have
to
say
ive
been
disappointed
in
both
i
doubt
im
going
to
finish
it
i
am
a
fan
of
the
summer
beers
but
this
one
was
a
huge
disappointment
drinkability
easy
drinking
another
good
one
from
harpoon
d
the
overabundance
of
bubbles
hurts
this
one
a
bit
as
well
as
that
tiny
out
of
place
sugary
taste
d
very
good
nice
summer
brew
harpoon
drinkability
is
fairly
high
low
alcohol
makes
for
easy
consumption
simple
but
decent
flavors
also
make
this
easily
sessionable
pale
golden
with
a
foamy
white
head
leaves
some
lace
very
fresh
clean
almost
lemonygrassy
scent
the
beer
has
a
crsip
clean
bite
that
is
wondeefully
refreshing
and
indeed
an
excellent
warm
weather
beer
the
finish
has
a
restrained
but
nicely
crisp
bitterness
with
a
whiff
of
tart
appley
fruit
at
the
very
end
the
finish
is
quite
long
i
love
the
tartness
a
great
summer
session
beer
very
well
done
the
dry
bitterness
is
bringing
it
down
a
little
for
me
until
i
get
to
köln
which
probably
wont
be
any
time
soon
i
guess
i
wont
really
know
what
a
true
kölsch
tastes
like
i
do
know
this
is
an
acceptable
summer
quencher
that
i
would
drink
again
if
handed
to
me
good
for
summer
yeah
08
celtics
go
pierce
d
very
nice
and
refreshing
kolsch
beer
better
than
most
a
nice
summer
brew
pick
some
up
for
mowing
the
lawn
d
pretty
drinkable
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
around
for
the
hot
summer
days
actually
had
this
twice
on
saturday
once
was
on
tap
right
at
the
brewery
during
the
ba
fest
meeting
the
second
was
when
i
picked
up
a
12
pack
for
a
bbq
later
that
night
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thick
head
that
fades
quick
unlike
most
summer
beers
that
are
a
bit
cloudy
this
sticks
with
the
kolsch
style
and
is
a
pretty
crisp
and
clear
yellow
smell
has
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
the
taste
is
very
good
and
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
unlike
other
summers
this
beer
doesnt
try
to
get
all
fancy
with
lots
of
ingredients
its
just
a
smooth
easy
drinking
brew
great
for
a
summer
night
hanging
outside
while
grilling
i
prefer
to
have
a
pint
of
this
over
rival
sam
summer
any
day
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
very
fresh
and
very
tasty
for
the
summer
im
not
super
familiar
with
cask
beers
to
rate
this
amongst
other
real
ales
but
it
was
quite
good
wellcarbonated
light
and
refreshing
excellent
summer
drink
but
highly
reminiscent
of
american
macro
lager
if
they
sold
it
as
that
itd
be
one
of
my
favorites
rereview
two
months
later
i
gave
the
beer
an
extra
5
in
terms
of
drinkability
as
it
settles
there
is
a
slight
creaminess
that
dulls
the
edge
of
the
overly
sharp
crispness
straight
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
still
an
inoffensive
beer
with
no
measure
of
complexity
just
jotted
down
a
few
notes
here
looked
really
nice
with
a
decent
head
and
lacing
smell
very
fresh
tasted
very
fresh
and
refreshing
with
a
tad
of
clover
honeyed
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
will
buy
this
one
again
very
good
beer
d
very
drinkable
as
none
of
the
flavors
are
overpowering
and
it
goes
down
easy
not
an
enduring
classic
but
if
you
want
a
light
summer
beer
that
rises
above
the
mass
of
undifferentiated
pilsbased
seasonals
this
is
one
to
consider
pours
a
five
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
good
lace
crystal
clear
pale
amber
color

carbonation
and

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capitol
convenience
concord
nh
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
solid
kolsch
but
the
things
i
like
to
look
for
in
this
style
werent
present
it
was
also
a
little
fizzy
in
my
opinion
for
the
style
its
a
refreshing
beer
great
for
the
summer
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
expected
a
more
bold
beer
from
harpoon
this
beer
poured
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
it
was
smooth
bodied
and
went
down
very
easily
the
flavor
was
where
i
felt
it
fell
short
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
stood
out
about
it
it
would
be
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
overly
impressive
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
high
carbonation
grassy
herbal
aromas
are
present
the
taste
is
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
maltiness
and
the
bitter
hoppiness
neither
one
overpowers
the
other
there
is
a
nice
soft
mouthfeel
easy
drinkability
would
be
nice
after
mowing
the
lawn
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
really
refreshing
it
goes
down
like
water
for
me
but
holds
a
respectable
alcohol
content
that
will
make
me
wish
i
didnt
kill
the
whole
sixer
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
soon
d
why
bother
drinkability
light
cool
and
easy
to
consume
highly
drinkable
with
a
clean
mellow
flavor
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
a
delicious
easy
quaffing
lawnmower
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
during
this
hot
weather
very
refreshing
this
beer
pours
very
well
very
light
crisp
color
with
a
head
that
lasts
about
a
quarter
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
nonexistant
the
worst
part
of
the
beer
the
taste
is
nice
good
amount
of
hops
without
out
being
too
overbearing
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
light
making
it
nice
on
a
summer
day
maybe
a
little
too
strong
for
me
to
drink
all
day
long
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
probably
reach
for
something
with
a
lighter
feel
or
taste
overall
score
is
bumped
up
since
the
taste
should
be
something
like
3
7
balanced
taste
of
malt
and
hops
ending
on
the
bitter
hoppier
side
mouthfeel
is
light
and
nicely
carbonated
crisp
dry
and
refreshing
flavorful
beer
but
not
too
complex
easy
to
drink
although
partial
to
heavier
beers
i
enjoyed
this
brew
most
drinkable
very
suitable
for
a
summer
session
d
excellent
one
of
the
best
kolsches
available
here
in
the
states
try
this
while
its
in
season
its
a
good
experience
especially
for
the
price
and
availability

with

not

its

not

its
a

brew
the
hops
are

and
its

the
flavor
is
not

enough
to
buy
a
12er
as
i
had
hoped
to
if
i
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
but
not
too
light
and
good
for
style
overall
this
is
a
ok
beer
but
not
the
best
harpoon
has
to
offer
to
my
palate
i
cant
give
it
bad
reviews
as
they
arent
merrited
but
i
was
disappointed
and
expected
more
this
was
ultra
bland
and
booring
for
a
summer
kolsh
ill
stick
to
gearys
drinkability
a
light
easydrinking
summertimetype
beer
if
it
were
any
lighter
it
would
float
away
overall
makes
for
a
great
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
actually
this
was
pretty
good
for
an
american
kolsch
it
was
more
flavorful
than
most
i
tried
this
beer
on
tap
when
the
server
brought
it
over
i
thought
the
bar
tender
had
mixed
up
the
order
and
gave
me
a
budweiser
after
tasting
the
beer
i
still
thought
it
was
bud
so
i
asked
if
they
mixed
up
the
order
indeed
it
was
the
correct
beer
i
was
disappointed
because
harpoon
usually
puts
out
decent
beer
but
this
one
is
terrible
the
color
is
golden
yellow
like
that
of
a
macrobrew
and
it
leaves
a
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
nothing
special
typical
hops
and
smells
of
canned
beer
the
taste
was
similar
to
macro
pilsners
like
pbr
wont
be
drinking
this
one
again
nicely
drinkable
beer
no
over
powering
or
overly
complex
flavors
here
this
is
all
about
the
noble
hops
and
i
find
it
quite
refreshing
a
summer
beer
i
can
recommend
that
simply
never
makes
it
to
california
on
a
regular
basis
d
eh
an
ok
beer
thats
worth
trying
but
its
not
going
to
rock
your
world
ill
stick
with
a
straight
ufo
case
if
i
pick
up
harpoon
again
d
great
summer
drinking
beer
this
is
an
easy
quaffing
beer
with
a
mellow
texture
despite
the
bubbles
fairly
straitforward
without
any
bells
or
whistles
just
some
solid
crystal
malts
and
tangy
but
mild
european
hops
not
big
on
flavor
but
what
is
there
is
drinkable
and
refreshing
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
i
cant
see
ever
turning
it
down
i
spent
a
few
days
in
cologne
last
year
and
sampled
several
brands
of
koelsch
there
and
brought
a
stange
glass
home
koelsch
is
a
tremendously
tastey
and
rare
styleand
its
amazing
how
fast
the
koelners
can
drink
them
and
serve
them
this
is
the
closest
ive
had
in
north
america
to
what
you
get
there
koelsch
is
a
very
delicate
beer
and
spoils
quickly
so
even
the
german
brands
available
on
tap
ive
had
in
the
usa
dont
taste
as
authentically
koelnish
as
harpoon
try
it
fellow
geeks
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
the
head
disapated
quite
quick
leaving
a
fine
white
film
across
the
top
mild
lacing
down
the
glass
decent
carbonation
making
this
beer
light
and
airy
smell
is
light
and
refreshing
no
watered
down
flavor
has
good
body
and
mouthfeel
pale
malts
mixed
with
a
light
sweetness
well
rounded
light
flavor
with
a
good
malt
profile
with
light
hints
of
hops
leaves
a
nice
mild
hop
tang
on
the
tounge
smooth
and
drinkable
from
start
to
finish
certainly
a
great
brew
to
enjoy
on
any
nice
sunny
day
outside
this
kolsch
is
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
session
brews
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
light
somewhat
citrusy
with
some
hints
of
malt
the
taste
is
also
light
if
a
bit
bland
malty
for
sure
and
par
the
style
a
vinous
grape
like
dryness
is
present
there
isnt
much
indication
of
hops
in
this
beer
either
it
does
fit
the
style
somewhat
but
couldnt
possibly
be
the
best
version
of
it
out
there
definitely
light
thirstquenching
and
refreshing
extremely
drinkable
appropriate
for
the
warmer
seasons
but
would
be
good
all
year
round
in
my
opinion
tmdhops
all
the
way
though
but
not
like
an
ipa
these
are
light
and
tingle
the
tongue
again
the
floral
and
slightly
grassy
taste
as
well
as
a
light
citrus
lemongrapefruit
note
there
is
a
bitterness
though
out
the
beer
that
lingers
but
as
it
lingers
it
decreases
creating
a
refreshing
finish
light
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
beer
to
try
and
convert
a
macro
drinker
with
not
bad
but
now
i
want
my
summerfest
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
three
finger
head
that
holds
to
one
finger
then
fades
to
just
cover
the
beer
smell
is
of
earthy
malt
and
spice
from
the
hops
rich
wheat
malt
up
front
then
the
hops
pick
up
the
middle
to
a
slightly
bitter
end
light
and
crisp
with
lots
of
carbonation
really
like
this
beer
style
great
session
beer
d
the
sweetness
caught
me
offguard
given
the
style
but
once
i
got
used
to
it
i
found
the
beer
kind
of
tasty
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
decent
kick
for
a
lawnmower
beer
it
might
not
be
the
best
summer
beer
or
the
best
kolsch
that
ive
had
but
it
was
a
decent
beer
d
although
its
nothing
spectacular
this
is
one
id
keep
in
the
fridge
for
a
hot
summer
day
when
im
working
outside
it
would
definitely
hit
the
spot
poors
an
almost
lemonade
esqu
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
head
that
quickly
faded
to
leave
some
nice
lacing
down
the
sides
smell
is
very
light
some
maltiness
and
a
bit
of
a
fruity
smell
but
not
strong
enough
to
narrow
it
down
taste
has
a
distictive
lime
touch
to
it
very
lite
beer
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
think
nice
bit
of
a
dry
hop
after
but
not
too
miuch
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
very
lite
and
tastey
one
of
the
best
summer
brews
i
have
had
not
bad
for
a
light
summer
beer
poured
to
a
hazy
golden
color
with
white
head
that
lingered
well
and
then
left
decent
lacing
aroma
was
not
real
strong
but
had
hints
of
fruit
an
wheat
taste
again
while
not
real
dominant
was
similar
to
a
light
hefeweizen
left
a
good
thirst
quenching
palate
not
a
great
beer
but
pretty
deecent
peace
bc
im
usually
a
fan
of
harpoons
beers
but
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
their
lineup
its
too
dry
and
frankly
doesnt
taste
that
great
given
that
pilsner
urquell
and
sn
summerfest
are
in
the
same
price
range
why
would
you
pick
this
up
disappointing
drinkability
as
the
summer
is
winding
down
i
figured
i
get
away
and
try
the
harpoon
summer
offering
the
finishing
bite
seems
to
detract
from
an
otherwise
nice
presentation
im
not
sure
if
this
would
earn
a
place
in
my
summer
beer
fridge
to
take
the
edge
off
a
long
saturday
of
yard
work
never
being
a
big
fan
of
summer
beers
i
though
i
would
give
this
a
try
anyways
considering
it
was
from
harpoon
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
lemon
grass
in
it
and
was
suprised
when
there
almost
wasnt
any
in
the
taste
not
even
the
smell
i
was
drinking
it
at
the
harppon
beer
dinner
and
it
was
supposed
to
work
well
with
what
i
was
eating
it
definetly
didnt
tastes
were
way
off
even
though
i
love
harpoon
and
everything
they
do
i
will
still
stay
from
this
one
all
things
considered
this
is
a
very
good
seasonal
beer
that
meets
the
needs
of
summer
beer
drinkers
it
is
very
crisp
with
an
excellent
clean
aftertaste
it
has
mainly
citrus
nose
and
mild
hopped
flavor
that
accent
the
milder
grain
tastes
good
carbonation
color
and
lacing
that
persists
very
clean
finish
which
pushes
the
drinkability
very
high
i
only
wish
harpoon
was
available
locally
ive
never
been
disappointed
with
any
of
their
beers
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
stamp
this
one
recommended
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
1
head
lacing
remains
until
the
end
smells
faintly
of
citrusy
hops
taste
is
slightly
of
hops
with
hints
of
citrus
and
finishes
clean
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
name
says
it
all
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
prefect
for
those
hot
summer
days
i
will
absolutely
have
this
beer
again
overall
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
this
a
top
tier
summer
brew
a
good
rendition
of
an
underrepresented
style
im
probably
being
harsh
on
this
beer
i
am
normally
a
big
fan
of
harpoons
beers
which
makes
me
wonder
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
my
keg
skunked
cooked
etc
but
after
taking
an
informal
poll
among
many
of
my
friends
the
verdict
is
that
the
beer
is
just
dissapointing
not
defective
seems
a
bit
over
carbonated
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
there
is
definitely
a
sense
of
hoppiness
if
that
is
a
word
but
seems
like
it
might
need
more
hops
i
guess
i
think
it
seems
a
bit
bland
for
my
taste
actually
i
seem
to
think
its
just
out
of
balance
overall
drinkable
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
stick
to
harpoons
other
beers
good
drinkability
on
a
summer
day
could
have
quite
a
few
more
poured
with
a
thin
white
head
that
stayed
there
for
a
bit
a
very
clear
light
yellow
color
nose
is
lacking
maybe
some
mild
citrus
but
thats
it
taste
is
very
grainy
and
slightly
malty
with
a
strong
metallic
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
i
guess
drinkability
is
ok
is
you
can
handle
the
metallic
taste
to
me
it
tasted
very
much
like
a
not
so
great
macro
lager
drinkable
in
quantity
but
not
particularly
exciting
not
bad
though
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
certainly
worth
trying
drinkability
the
ale
is
fairly
refreshing
but
not
the
best
representation
of
the
kolsch
style
bottom
line
there
are
more
refreshing
summer
brews
out
there
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
sized
head
moderate
head
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
is
very
weak
with
a
light
hop
and
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
a
reflection
of
the
smell
not
much
is
revealed
through
taste
that
is
not
present
in
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
seems
rather
uncharacteristic
of
most
ales
in
that
it
is
thin
and
over
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
nice
to
cool
down
with
overall
i
cant
recommend
this
a
disappointing
offering
from
a
good
brewery
i
dont
think
this
may
be
indicitive
of
the
brew
and
have
a
subtle
feeling
i
only
got
a
bad
bottle
but
will
pick
up
a
new
one
and
edit
this
review
accordingly
cheers
a
clear
light
gold
appearance
with
a
fairly
small
head
the
smell
was
stronger
in
malt
than
i
would
have
expected
then
a
lemon
hop
scent
came
through
taste
was
more
hops
than
malt
but
well
balanced
very
crisp
and
light
mouthfeel
almost
tingly
an
easy
to
drink
pool
beer
but
nothing
terribly
special
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
had
some
citrus
notes
that
complimented
the
malt
and
hop
tones
the
taste
was
a
good
malt
and
hop
balance
that
left
a
bit
of
citrus
on
the
tongue
the
beer
has
a
fairly
light
body
and
makes
for
a
drinkable
summer
beer
just
what
it
is
intended
for
this
beer
was
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
night
definitely
a
nice
summer
session
beer
for
your
bbq
light
bodied
bubbly
yet
refreshing
i
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
to
drink
when
outside
working
on
my
bike
not
the
most
interesting
beer
but
for
what
it
is
quite
good
bl
another
winner
from
the
poon
overall
impression
drinkable
and
clean
flavors
but
not
overly
exciting
nice
gateway
beer
and
a
nice
session
beer
as
the
weather
warms
12oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
1
finger
head
and
good
lace
light
malt
slight
corn
lemon
and
honey
light
malt
up
front
with
a
nice
citrus
zing
hop
bitterness
predominates
in
the
aftertaste
a
decent
brew
but
too
much
bitterness
reduces
its
summertime
drinkability
i
didnt
find
it
as
quenching
as
i
had
hoped
a
decent
beer
though
d
its
a
great
micomacro
beer
exactly
what
its
intended
to
be
drinkability
while
i
havent
tried
too
many
commercial
kölsches
this
one
is
close
to
style
and
is
very
good
this
beer
is
exceptionally
clear
in
the
glass
it
is
pretty
tasty
light
without
lacking
flavor
it
starts
with
a
nice
fruitiness
smoothes
with
a
honey
flavor
and
finishes
with
slight
hop
kick
this
is
a
good
summer
offering
and
one
that
i
would
enjoy
very
much
in
the
heat
i
would
also
say
that
this
is
the
best
of
harpoons
seasonals
simple
light
and
refreshing
nothing
to
write
home
about
just
a
good
refreshing
summer
brew
d
easy
to
drink
would
make
a
great
session
beer
on
a
back
porch
while
the
bbq
coals
smolder
paid
1
00
for
a
12oz
bottle
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
mild
autumn
afternoon
pours
a
nice
pale
golden
with
a
light
frothy
head
good
retention
not
much
lacing
but
good
bubbles
throughout
travelling
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
is
decent
light
citrus
and
hops
taste
follows
with
a
bubbly
smooth
start
growing
into
a
moderate
hoppiness
and
ending
with
subtle
hints
of
citrus
pretty
decent
overall
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
summer
beer
that
is
a
much
better
alternative
to
all
of
the
other
watery
weakbodied
and
weakspirited
summer
ales
that
every
brewery
seems
compelled
to
create
this
is
always
a
surefire
safe
bet
odd
characteristics
for
this
style
its
almost
as
if
the
lemon
zest
was
added
after
the
beer
complete
however
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
its
drinkability
is
very
high
mainly
because
it
is
so
light
as
are
most
summer
brews
a
little
uninspired
but
good
summer
brews
are
much
better
on
tap
golden
color
with
a
thin
white

nice
steady
flow
of
carbonation
helps
to
maintain
the
thin
coating
of
head
on
top
light
earthybread
malt
smell
and
taste
dont
get
much
else
from
this
beer
its
an
ok
summer
beer
but
just
dosnt
have
that
wow
effect
cant
say
that
id
recomend
it
but
also
wouldnt
say
that
its
bad
had
a
chance
to
try
this
during
a
recent
trip
to
boston
poured
a
clear

into
the
glass
with
a
big
frothy
head
very
light
aroma
with
slight
lemon
and
grassy
flavours

but
crisp
and
refreshing

good
drinkable
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
gold
with
a
smudge
of
orange
suspiciously
even
blanket
of
white
becomes
translucent

the
drink
is
thoroughly

as
firm
bitter
resins
constrain
peach
and
tangerine
marmelade
fruit
flavors
peanutshaped
marshmallows
flavors
lurk
within
full
creamy
texture
is
what
i
expect
from
american
kölsch
there
are
brief
episodes
when
i
think
this
beer
is
a
successfully
crafted
light
ale
i
am
happy
to
forgive
the
inappropriate
use
of
the
term
denoting
the
classic
cologne
beer
style
but
then
it
seems
to
lose
focus
offering
an
unintigrated
if
balanced
mix
of
sweet
and
bitter
nothing
compels
one
drink
after
another
it
should
be
fairly
obvious
by
now
that
im
both
surprised
and
delighted
by
this
summer
seasonal
from
harpoon
it
has
loads
of
personality
is
bursting
with
flavor
and
is
as
dry
and
as
hoppy
a
kolsch
as
ive
ever
tasted
this
one
is
a
winner
i
usually
expect
more
from
harpoon
this
beer
looks
light
to
medium
straw
colored
and
highly
carbonated
smells
lightly
malty
with
earthy
grassy
notes
a
bit
sour
and
bitter
smelling
perhaps
a
bit
grainy
and
astringent
tastes
more
malty
than
aroma
still
persists
with
yeastiness
and
graininess
hops
are
a
bit
out
of
balance
but
i
believe
that
it
makes
this
beer
better
vegital
as
the
body
weakens
and
into
the
finish
bitterness
lingers
a
little
too
long
this
is
out
of
style
for
a
kolsch
and
too
astringent
for
a
golden
ale
the
finish
doesnt
seem
to
fit
quite
right
but
it
doesnt
take
too
much
away
from
this
very
reasonable
summer
choice
pours
a
nice
bright
clear

colour
with
a
fluffy

very
easy

a
hop
bitterness
hits
the
tounge
at
first
but
is
followed
by
a
clean
grain
zesty
dry
aftertaste
no
in
your
face
flavors
just
a
clean
lightness
that
is
great
for
the
summer
heat
a
perfect
summer
time
beer
that
pairs
well
with
any
grilled
meat
overall
a
nice
refreshing
brew
to
enjoy
out
by
the
pool
on
a
warm
independence
day
not
something
id
buy
in
bulk
but
a
suitable
brew
given
the
time
of
year
on
the
flip
side
this
isnt
swill
its
at
least
true
to
the
kölsch
style
just
a
little
disappointing
its
definitely
drinkable
and
good
for
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
and
quite
frankly
most
us
brewers
have
a
hard
time
with
kölsch
so
maybe
i
cant
blame
them
not
a
lot
to
rave
about
but
very
little
to
dislike
i
thought
it
was
an
enjoyable
summer
beer
especially
on
the
94
degree
day
that
i
tried
it
highly
drinkable
in
the
heat
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
good
fluffy
head
lots
of
bubbles
feeding
it
nice
lacing
too
a
little
bit
of
spicy
hops
in
the
nose
but
pretty
one
demensional
aroma
wise
hmm
nothing
in
the
taste
a
little
bit
of
hops
a
little
malt
but
really
bland
not
bad
tasting
its
certainly
refreshing
good
for
a
bbq
and
it
quenches
your
thirst
but
thats
about
it
pours
a
vibrant
golden
hue
with
a
flourish
of
a
small
white
head
that
is
gone
in
under
a
minute
a
bit
lighter
than
a
kolsch
should
be
in
my
opinion
but
appetizing
nonetheless
aroma
of
sweet
malt
crisp
lager
yeast
and
a
touch
of
biscuit
and
honey
more
light
sweet
malt
on
the
palate
up
front
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
emerging
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
finish
has
a
bit
of
diacetyl
in
it
kind
of
unpleasant
body
is
substantial
enough
but
a
tad
foamy
actually
i
think
the
bottle
i
have
right
now
is
markedly
worse
than
the
one
i
had
last
night
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
warm
summer
night
but
there
a
certainly
better
summer
ales
to
be
had
a
nice
crisp
pouring
beer
with
bright
coloring
of
light
gold
very
drinkable
with
a
thin
soft
head
i
quite
enjoy
the
ease
of
drinkability
and
the
light
bodied
presense
coupled
with
a
satisfying
clean
flavor
this
kolsch
style
beverage
is
ideal
for
a
summer
fix
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
more
of
this
i
would
buy
it
again
because
harpoon
has
good
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
to
boot
a
little
bit
light
for
my
personal
tastes
but
i
know
this
is
in
character
for
the
style
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
without
thinking
twice
this
is
beer
is
pretty
much
what
one
would
expect
in
a
kolsch
mild
and
refreshing
in
all
respects
pours
sunshine
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
left
some
nice
lace
rings
on
the
glass
slightly
hazy
not
as
clear
as
some
the
german
kolsch
i
have
sampled
but
very
similar
in
palate
and
profile
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
taste
is
mildly
sour
with
some
biscuit
malt
notes
and
a
clean
dry
finish
a
very
drinkable
summer
beer
on
tap
at
barleys
ale
house
1
the
kölsch
is
not
an
overly
complex
style
but
i
enjoy
it
for
being
straightforward
and
refreshing
unfortunately
harpoons
version
is
overly
simple
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
light
hops
and
lemon
aroma
lightbodied
with
a
minimal
hops
flavor
along
with
some
grass
and
citrus
the
finish
is
clean
and
a
little
tart
but
short
this
beer
is
not
memorable
despite
being
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
i
do
not
recommend
this
one
id
take
a
sams
summer
ale
over
it
anyway
and
thats
not
saying
much
just
way
too
sour
without
much
else
to
it
for
my
tastes
pours
a
golden
color
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
quite
clean
with
little
to
speak
of
save
some
slight
malt
and
hops
the
standard
for
the
samples
i
have
had
of
the
kolsch
style
mouthfeel
is
light
while
still
being
enjoyable
clean
and
crisp
well
carbonated
taste
is
clean
with
light
malt
sweetness
and
slight
bitterness
coming
out
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
could
drink
these
all
day
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
when
something
easy
drinking
is
desired
big
foamy
offwhite
colored
head
is
all
kinds
of
sticky
dozens
of
streams
of
fine
bubbles
rise
through
the
transparent
sun
colored
beer
faint
aroma
maybe
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
and
pinch
of
grainyness
soft
light
beer
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
and
a
little
grainy
thats
about
it
there
might
be
some
floral
hops
in
there
but
they
barely
make
it
to
the
surface
im
assuming
this
is
pretty
close
to
a
kolsch
but
i
just
dont
like
the
sweet
grainyness
so
much
better
than
the
sam
adams
summer
ale
i
had
earlier
this
week
even
if
it
is
a
different
style
not
a
big
fan
of
the
koslch
style
but
this
is
an
exception
great
golden
color
nice
head
and
lacing
good
with
the
bbq
chicken
i
had
with
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
it
did
have
abit
of
dust
on
the
bottle
so
im
not
sure
how
old
it
was
but
tasted
nice
and
refreshing
with
hints
of
fruitiness
light
and
refreshing
this
brew
has
a
flavor
that
is
crisp
and
delicate
a
good
session
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
no
im
not
just
saying
because
it
says
on
the
bottle
that
this
beer
is
perfect
for
summer
recommended
drinkability
how
long
can
you
last
this
one
is
a
full
on
session
brew
huge
session
brew
in
fact
eh
ok
the
5
5
might
be
worth
noting
before
consuming
too
many
but
this
is
perfect
for
summer
and
should
make
many
an
appearance
at
many
a
barbeque
in
my
opinion
it
blows
sierra
nevadas
summer
offering
out
of
the
water
light
drinkable
and
pretty
good
flavors
for
a
kolsch
a
nice
beach
beer
for
the
summer
poured
into
the
collins
glass
a
bright
yellow
with
a
rocky
head
that
lasted
a
minute
or
so
while
leaving
lace
on
most
of
the
cylinder
some
citrus
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
crispy
and
refreshing
with
some
additional
citrus
flavor
almost
zesty
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
good
carbonation
keeping
it
lively
is
it
the
collins
glass
or
does
this
beer
dissapear
rather
quickly
the
glass
holds
about
12
oz
so
it
must
be
me
this
beer
has
summer
session
written
all
over
it
for
the
spouse
and
me
damn
shame
too
since
the
lemon
nature
is
amped
down
in
the
flavor
for
a
nicely
mixed
middle
after
a
citrus
attack
lovely
mouthfilling
fine
carbonation
makes
it
gulpable
without
pain
yes
a
light
body
but
with
presence
something
the
ricecorn
guys
could
learn
from
finish
is
full
of
lingering
malt
citrus
butter
and
bitter
i
think
absab
drinkers
would
really
enjoy
this
it
could
be
a
gateway
beer
those
guys
rarely
smell
their
beer
i
might
have
another
on
a
warm
day
sitting
out
in
the
sun
or
having
a
plate
of
nachos
but
not
as
a
regular
drinking
beer
this
beer
poured
a
yellowish
gold
color
with
loads
of
carbonation
and
a
large
white
head
of
foamy
goodness
slight
chill
haze
apparent
but
disappeared
after
a
few
sips
golden
and
lively
the
aroma
yields
pleasant
notes
of
sweet
and
fresh
nutty
grains
pine
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
butter
the
taste
is
very
pleasing
light
yet
flavorful
with
a
slightly
sweet
and
bitter
tang
finish
wow
this
is
an
excellent
beer
a
great
americanized
version
of
a
german
kolsch
beer
crisp
clean
and
could
be
the
near
perfect
summer
beer
left
me
wanting
more
nice
clear
yellow
color
decent
white
sticky
head
lemony
aroma
sweet
with
a
little
hops
nice
taste
mostly
sweet
lemon
like
some
type
of
lemonsugar
candy
with
some
hops
towards
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sickly
sweet
for
my
taste
though
but
maybe
thats
just
a
function
of
the
style
real
easy
drinking
great
for
relaxing
on
a
summers
day
even
though
its
cool
and
rainy
right
now
its
a
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
small
amount
of
white
head
it
has
a
light
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
is
clear
and
crisp
with
a
good
dry
bite
in
the
end
the
feel
is
light
and
dry
with
a
slight
hoppy
aftertaste
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
one
kolsch
i
had
had
previously
so
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
offering
definately
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
but
im
not
sure
when
i
would
say
hey
i
really
want
another
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
first
choice
for
me
personally
mostly
a
hop
taste
little
malt
but
there
is
still
some
there
interesting
beer
highly
drinable
but
nothing
overly
remarkable
a
very
nice
beer
indeed
figured
i
would
try
this
one
out
since
i
usually
dig
their
other
seasonal
brews
i
really
liked
the
taste
of
it
it
kind
of
started
off
as
a
lighter
hoppier
brew
but
then
switched
over
to
a
semimalty
medium
bodied
brew
ofcourse
there
was
the
presence
of
citrus
fruits
and
other
lighter
tropical
fruits
along
with
the
little
bite
of
hops
the
head
was
nice
started
out
very
frothy
and
thick
but
then
flattened
out
to
a
fairly
thick
laceing
i
would
classify
this
as
my
new
favorite
lawnmower
beer
very
refreshing
and
would
be
great
to
have
after
work
poured
out
a
cloudy
light
yellowgolden
color
with
some
nice
carbonation
from
the
tap
of
course
smell
consisted
of
grains
hops
lemon
citrus
type
aromas
and
some
wheat
in
there
as
well
taste
was
pretty
good
gentle
hops
attack
the
palate
with
some
grainy
tastes
as
well
with
an
underlying
sweetness
that
holds
true
to
the
kolsch
style
aftertaste
was
mostly
that
sweet
taste
but
wasnt
too
bad
this
is
a
great
session
beer
this
to
me
was
one
of
those
across
the
board
beers
where
the
rating
was
the
same
in
every
catergory
its
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
but
its
not
that
great
either
what
it
turns
out
to
be
is
a
basic
thirst
quenching
brew
for
the
summer
it
pours
a
decent
golden
yellow
with
a
sudsy
soapy
looking
head
on
top
decent
stickinesss
here
too
the
smell
is
basic
and
pretty
much
matches
the
taste
sweet
wheat
and
grain
the
flavour
holds
a
bit
of
a
fruity
zing
in
the
middle
and
has
a
refreshing
finish
its
not
as
lemony
as
many
summer
brews
which
is
nice
but
it
doesnt
distinguish
itself
in
any
other
fashion
which
would
make
me
run
back
to
the
store
to
grab
more
sure
id
have
another
one
but
this
one
definitely
wouldnt
be
on
my
list
of
have
to
have
summer
brews
delicate
hints
of
fruit
herby
hops
a
grainy
biscuity
dryness
combined
with
restrained
bitterness
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
light
and
crisp
but
still
sweet
good
thirst
quencher
for
hot
weather
but
not
something
id
look
to
often
abv
seems
really
low
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
laces
with
nice
sticky
foam
the
smell
is
of
mild
hops
with
a
slightly
fruity
smell
that
seems
a
bit
of
the
pulpy
variety
the
flavor
is
truly
kolsch
with
a
bit
of
bite
from
the
hops
covering
the
underlying
sweetness
the
feel
is
a
bit
weak
with
little
crispness
good
drinkability
from
the
medium
feel
refreshing
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
clean
refreshing
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
malts
and
dry
lager
yeast
there
is
little
in
the
line
of
hops
but
it
is
true
to
style
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
clean
finish
it
is
a
bit
dry
with
a
slight
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
summer
brew
it
goes
down
easy
its
light
and
refreshing
on
those
hot
summer
days
great
summer
brew
drank
three
or
four
on
saturday
while
blistering
in
the
summer
heat
at
preakness
would
go
excellently
with
a
cookout
or
fishing
trip
i
enjoy
a
good
kolsch
in
the
summer
and
this
beer
will
be
one
of
the
ones
i
look
to
this
summer
to
fulfill
that
role
it
pours
very
yellowgolden
with
a
rather
large
head
that
has
some
yeast
in
it
the
beer
has
little
smell
other
than
a
slight
tendancy
towards
the
citrus
it
tastes
light
and
wheaty
with
a
background
hint
of
orange
peel
lime
peel
or
lemon
peel
its
hard
to
tell
it
is
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
best
served
relatively
cold
i
recommend
this
for
drinking
outside
during
the
summer
especially
if
you
are
planning
on
putting
back
more
than
one
appearance
light
golden
tone
with
a
nice
full
two
fingers
worth
of
white
head
leaves
big
chunks
of
even
lacing
with
each
sip
nice
appearance
aroma
touch
of
citrus
hops
to
the
forefront
with
grassy
herbal
lemon
hop
tea
tones
malts
pale
pilsner
like
never
had
a
kolsch
but
im
getting
some
mild
fruit
undertones
as
well
taste
completely
refreshing
just
plain
good
for
summer
beer
drinking
touch
of
lemon
peel
and
other
fruity
qualities
are
here
lemon
grass
hops
with
pale
malts
pretty
bitter
in
flavor
but
theres
a
firm
hand
on
balance
here
mouthfeel
light
bodied
higher
caronation
but
smooth
drinkability
anytime
not
bad
refreshing
and
relatively
complex
nice
beer
i
wanna
try
more
authentic
kolsch
and
more
kolsch
style
beers
overall
a
nice
summer
brew
that
would
be
a
definite
thirst
quencher
ill
have
too
purchase
some
more
for
the
hot
humid
new
jersey
summers
pours
a
hazy
yellow
orange
colour
with
a
frothy
one
finger
head
which
releases
absolutly
wonderful
aromas
of
lemon
lime
grapefruit
hops
and
malts
the
taste
is
also
as
fruity
and
citric
as
the
aroma
lemons
limes
and
grapefruits
attack
the
pallate
it
leaves
a
mild
hoppy
finish
and
will
keep
you
in
good
hands
this
summer
this
beer
was
reviewed
right
out
of
the
fridge
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
not
too
much
head
on
it
with
what
was
there
dying
down
quickly
gold
color
very
clear
and
somewhat
darked
than
a
pilsner
smell
was
clean
and
lagerish
with
minimal
hops
taste
was
also
clean
and
light
very
crisp
with
some
hops
presence
but
i
cant
tell
the
type
lingering
grassy
hop
flavor
very
clean
quite
refreshing
drink
high
drinkability
despite
kind
of
high
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
nothing
spectacular
but
a
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
sitting
on
my
roof
light
crisp
refreshing
it
is
a
very
drinkable
session
brew
but
the
flavor
is
lacking
a
bit
a
good
balance
of
sweet
malts
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
and
take
the
wheel
for
a
bit
breads
come
in
at
the
end
it
sure
could
use
a
little
more
flavor
but
it
is
definitely
a
good
one
for
the
summer
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
lemony
yellow
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
the
head
that
was
produced
was
fairly
thin
but
dense
when
first
poured
then
settled
to
a
light
skim
on
the
top
of
the
beer
it
was
white
in
color
and
produced
a
watery
spotty
lace
the
aromas
that
were
produced
were
of
fresh
hops
flowers
spices
citrus
fruit
lemon
and
wheat
grains
an
aroma
that
came
across
crisp
and
precise
each
note
of
aroma
was
pronounced
so
that
you
could
identify
it
the
flavors
were
crisp
and
refreshing
tastes
of
fresh
hops
grasshay
lemon
fruit
light
sweet
malt
and
pronounced
wheat
grains
medium
bodied
slightly
bitter
on
the
tongue
but
not
overly
a
bit
dry
but
not
overly
i
guess
what
is
being
said
is
that
it
is
a
well
balanced
beer
crisp
clean
well
carbonated
and
refreshing
a
perfect
summertime
beer
very
good
example
of
its
style
i
would
definitely
get
again
mediumlight
body
with
tingling
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
an
easy
drinker
on
tap
at
the
brewery
a
light
clear
gold
ale
with
a
faint
white
head
that
dies
rapidly
aroma
is
also
quite
light
with
hints
of
citrusy
lemon
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
similar
to
a
german
pils
with
less
of
a
malt
character
a
real
thirst
quencher
and
not
much
else
this
summer
ale
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
creamy
bright
white
foam
that
settled
but
left
some
lace
the
smell
was
slightly
sweet
malt
and
grain
with
light
floral
hops
the
taste
was
malty
with
biscuit
flavor
and
floral
hops
the
finish
had
some
hop
bitterness
there
was
a
hint
of
citrus
overall
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
almost
creamy
but
with
a
crisp
finish
there
was
a
lingering
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
tongue
the
body
was
medium
this
was
a
nice
summer
beer
though
a
cleaner
finish
might
have
been
preferred
the
bottle
pours
a
crystalclear
strawgold
body
beneath
a
fluffy
head
of
brightwhite
froth
the
head
retention
is
good
and
it
maintains
a
halfinch
or
so
of
bigbubbled
foam
throughout
most
of
the
glass
additionally
the
lacing
is
quite
nice
and
it
leaves
some
fairly
solid
rings
at
the
outset
the
nose
displays
a
grainy
wheatish
malt
with
some
background
floral
grassy
and
even
spicy
hops
theres
a
mild
note
of
lemon
as
well
but
its
not
clear
as
to
where
its
coming
from
in
the
mouth
its
medium
bodied
with
a
gentle
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
the
flavor
delivers
the
sweetish
grainy
and
wheatlike
malt
that
the
aroma
promises
its
backed
by
a
subdued
underlying
bitterness
and
some
very
mild
hop
flavor
that
helps
to
dry
the
finish
which
lingers
shortly
with
some
grainy
maltiness
its
certainly
fullerbodied
and
more
malty
in
the
flavor
than
a
kolsch
from
koln
or
the
bonn
region
and
even
less
hoppy
but
its
still
a
decent
summer
beer
the
beer
is
pretty
much
yellow
there
is
a
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
the
aroma
is
pretty
mild
makes
it
hard
to
determine
whats
there
i
get
a
whiff
of
malts
and
maybe
some
lemon
the
taste
is
clean
enough
with
some
malt
sweetness
and
some
wheat
taste
not
too
much
to
it
but
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day

the
body
is
a
pale
gold
with
a
wimpy
head
there
is
a
very
slight
aroma
slight
enough
that
i
cant
really
pick
out
any
components
the
flavor
has
a
light
maltiness
with
a
faint
tartness
in
the
middle
theres
a
lingering
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
leaves
the

feeling

great
kolsch
taste

crisp
with

immensely
drinkable
i
only
bought
a
single
and
i
really
wish
that
i
had
bought
more
definitely
a

just
finished
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summers
day
beer
this
brew
pours
clear
gold
a
quick
head
with
little
lace
was
developed
from
the
pour
a
very
active
beer
after
the
pour
one
thing
i
did
like
was
the
constant
stream
of
tiny
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
the
aroma
is
mild
malt
with
hints
of
spice
and
citrus
the
taste
matches
the
aroma
with
a
nice
malt
start
and
the
hints
of
spices
and
citrus
i
noticed
a
slight
off
taste
toward
the
end
other
than
that
is
has
a
crisp
finish
a
light
body
makes
this
easy
to
drink
nothing
to
special
with
this
kolsch
a
slight
bit
above
average
this
is
a
decent
brew
from
the
folks
at
harpoon
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
medium
sized
head
that
dissipates
very
fast
and
leaves
virtually
no
lace
nose
was
crisp
with
light
hop
and
citrus
aromas
taste
was
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
with
some
mild
hop
undertones
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
finishing
dry
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
this
one
not
the
greatest
beer
that
ive
had
from
harpoon
for
me
this
one
was
just
ok
the
beer
had
a
nice
white
fluffy
head
that
left
a
foamy
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
fresh
white
bread
and
sublte
malty
sweetness
the
flavors
followed
suit
a
little
sweet
very
refreshing
with
bready
grainy
notes
it
finishes
a
mildly
dry
it
has
a
really
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
overall
a
really
great
beer
and
a
great
american
version
of
a
kolsch
i
will
drink
this
one
all
summer
harpoon
has
developed
a
knack
for
replicating
fringe
or
under
appreciated
beer
styles
and
exposing
us
to
them
this
summer
beer
resembles
a
wellmade
kölch
style
beer
a
light
hint
of
lemon
peel
lightly
herbal
flavor
clean
and

the
cool
liquid
just
tempts
you
gulp
large
mouthfuls

on
a
summer
evening
with
grilled
bratwurst
and
potato
salad
as
i
continue
to
empty
my
stock

summer
brews
i
sampled
this
one
again
very

a
hint
of
citrius
not

not
a

in

harpoon
summer
beer
is
a
definitive
example
of
a
kolsch
its
highly
drinkable
and
soft
on
the
palette
but
not
at
all
bland
at
first
glance
and
sniff
youre
thinking
its
another
lager
lets
throw
summer
on
the
label
and
sell
a
bunch
but
then
you
sip
and
a
most
definite
ester
character
sends
your
buds
reeling
i
dont
know
kölsch
however
i
do
know
tasty
wellbalanced
beer
and
this
is
one
next
time
you
are
in
the
beer
store
walk
right
past
those
light
lagers
and
grab
a
six
of
harpoon
summer
you
wont
be
disappointed
kolsch
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
has
a
lot
of
flavor
heavy
on
the
lemony
citrus
characteristics
finishes
grainy
dry
and
slightly
bitter
i
could
swear
there
are
some
grains
of
paradise
in
there
very
pleasant
summer
offering
clean
and
fresh
mild
grain
with
a
hint
of
citrus
in
the
hops

seems
the
ideal

it
is
what
most

brews
should

enjoyed
this
one
just
enough
hop
zing
make
this
beer
interesting
to
go
along
with
subtle
flavors
of
toasted
grain
and
lemonnot
a
rocket
science
beer
but
better
than
most
summer
seasonals
in
my
opinion
thanks
to
davo
for
the

a

fairly
strong
floral
and

pleasant
light
body
that
remains
dryon
the
palate
maybe
most
important
to
me
at
least
this
is
a
summer
seasonal
that
is
not
a
wheat
beer
or
heavily
fortified
with
various
flavorings
great
beer
to
quence
a
thirst
especially
a
warm
summer
one
one
of
the
best
local
summers
that
i
have
had
crisp
light
and
refreshing
without
sacrificing
any
flavor
the
lemon
flavor
is
just
enough
to
keep
your
interest
not
a
huge
summer
beer
lover
but
this
is
good

nothing
really
bold
here
in

quencher
this
was
the
staple
of
this
years
boston

for
my
small

of

pale

color
and
nice

are
inviting
on
a

light
aroma

taste
just
heavy
enough
to
give
substance
to
the
brew
reminded
me
of

easy

just
got
some
of
the
2002
batch
and
is
really
fresh
has
a
very
clear
golden

appearance
a
nice
frothy
head
formed
at
the
top
and
had
a
pleasing
grain
aroma
very
easy
to
drink
with
its
smooth
and
crisp
taste
very
little
hop
presence
if
any
at
all
but
instead
a
pleasant
wheat
flavor
dominates
with
a
clean
finish
not
amazingly
complex
but
i
believe
true
to
the
kolsch
style
if
pilsners
and
weissbier
are
your
thing
i
think
you
might
like
this
definately
will
make
for
good
summer
drinking
clear
yellow
with
a
fizzy
little
head
that
didnt
last

light

ok
o
decent
enough
kolsch
that
is
an
ale
almost
masquerading
as
a
lager
with
some
extra
heft
to
it
one
reviewer
below
called
it
boring
and
that
underscores
the
lack
of
much
distinctive
taste
better
than
most
mainstream
lagers
though
a
good
warm
weather
refresher
if
you
like
something
with
a
bit
more
presence
than
most
pilseners
or
light
lagers
however
you
may
find
other
kolsches
with
more
fruit
tones
than
this
one
like
most
saranac
beers
this
isnt
good
per
se
its
just
drinkable
and
about
average
to
below
average
for
the
style
it
worked
well
for
its
use
drinking
at
a
bbq
but
i
dont
think
id
ever
get
it
again
a
drinkable
yet
mostly
forgettable
beer
lightweight
and
weak
in
the
flavor
and
feel
and
just
doesnt
leave
you
fireup
for
more
a
lot
more
lemony
notes
in
the
flavor
but
theyre
still
muddled
by
lagerlike
pale
grain
staleness
and
adjunct
notes
of
rice
underlying
euro
flairs
lean
toward
germany
but
get
lost
in
the
fray
of
cheapness
the
intent
is
decent
i
suppose
but
theres
no
real
punch
other
than
a
burst
of
crisp
bubble
and
light
bitterness
in
the
forefront
all
of
that
gets
pushed
aside
with
a
halftoasted
grainy

stints

taste

it

which
kinda
saves
the
beer
for
me
just
a
very
simple
beer
if
i
was
out
on
deck
on
a
hot
day
mabye
this
would
be
refreshing
its
ok
just
in
the
mood
for
somthing
more
complex
true
to
style
hahahah
no
good
summer
drinking
you
bet
o
not
one
of
saranacs
best
the
other
bottle
from
the
sampler
will
probably
sit
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
not
in
any
rush
to
drink
it
its
not
an
offensive
beer
or
anything
its
just
not
that
good
the
flavor
itself
actually
isnt
bad
its
just
so
damn
weak
increase
the
flavor
and
this
could
be
a
solid
beer
o
decent
drinking
beer
there
are
better
ones
is
it
a
kolsch
maybe
maybe
not
o
not
a
bad
light
summer
brew
not
good
either
as
light
and
easy
as
the
kolsch
style
goes
i
think
this
saranac
version
is
especially
light
and
easy
almost
to
a
fault
or
certainly
to
a
point
of
being
unexciting
it
pours
a
nice
pale
golden
color
clean
and
clear
with
a
short
white
head
the
nose
is
german
malts
and
yeast
very
bready
but
light
like
a
pancake
hops
are
only
in
there
for
bittering
and
balance
which
are
both
dialed
in
the
nose
and
the
flavor
there
is
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
that
rounds
it
out
and
a
dry
refreshing
finish
that
begs
for
another
gulp
very
active
carbonation
and
a
thin
body
makes
it
even
lighter
and
this
is
a
very
sessionable
summer
beer
from
the
mix
pack
not
the
most
exciting
thing
they
are
doing
these
days
but
a
worthy
offering
for
hot
weather
my
dad
thinks
this
is
exceptional

and
this
reminds
me
of
a
pils
i
am
trying
to
be
fair
bubbly
and
clear
in
the
glass
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
disappears
a
hint
small
hint
of
malt
in
the
nose
and
the
flavor
is
a
very
drinkable
balance
of
malt
and
subtle
hops
for
a
fruity
aftertaste

mediocre
saranac
summer
ale
this
is
watery
from
pour
to

it
is
a
golden
yellow
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
on
my
glass
i
wouldnt
particularly
seek
this
out
the
saranac
summer
variety
is
not
endearing
but
it
works
well
as
a

and
i
wanted
another
a
great
summer
beer
i
cant
smell
much
else
except
for
a
little
bit
of
malt
that
being
said
and
i
honestly
dont
know
if
i
could
pick
it
out
of

this
would
be
a

one
for

but
a
bit
of
a

example
of
the

certainly
drinkable

not
a
whole

low
level

of

this
is
a
lawnmower
type
brew
something
to
drink
to
cool
off
without
sacrificing
a
lot
on
flavor
this
is
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
often
im
noticing
that
this
beer
is
strikingly

to
