o
for
a
rather
lightbodied
ale
this
beer
is
packed
with
lots
of
flavors
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
which
makes
this
perfectly
sessionable
o
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
easily
sessionable
and
exactly
what
i
would
find
in
a
proper
pub
this
is
a
decent
ale
if
the
caramel
and
malt
were
a
little
more
forward
this
would
really
be
a
good
beer
as
it
is
its
solid
and
highly
drinkable
im
not
sure
ill
buy
this
again
beause
this
isnt
a
style
i
buy
often
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
overall
based
on
the
name
i
wasnt
quite
expecting
a
bitter
and
though
this
isnt
a
standard
bitter
i
rather
enjoyed
its
unusual
flavors
diacetyl
and
all
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
this
beer
is
beautiful
a
vibrant
crisp
bloodruby
coloring
with
a
slight
ring
of
filmy
offwhite
head
around
the
edge
of
the
surface
aromas
of
toffee
richness
and
a
tangy
sweetness
blend
together
for
a
subtle
nose
flavors
are
bitter
forward
and
all
over
the
tongue
with
a
subtle
rich
toffee
backbone
that
peaks
its
head
around
the
corner
every
once
in
a
while
to
keep
things
on
an
even
keel
the
richness
almost
has
a
syrupy
quality
to
its
flavor
a
light
bodied
beer
this
feels
heavier
with
the
richness
of
the
flavors
but
somewhat
sharp
with
the
carbonation
and
bitterness
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
with
some
roastiness
to
it
the
beer
has
an
almost
smokey
light
and
crisp
finish
tasty
brew
a
good
drinking
beer
with
a
low
abv
and
great
flavor
overall
interesting
but
not
particularly
memorable
probably
wont
be
having
this
again
no
regrets
in
trying
it
though
d
not
a
bad
beer
nicely
balanced
with
a
very
sessionable
abv
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
not
the
best
of
its
style
but
not
bad
some
revision
with
new
bottle
on
april
2013
the
bottle
says
a
product
of
the
us
brewed
in
rochester
ny
although
the
website
says
uk
still
a
very
enjoyable
beer
o
not
bad
an
di
like
the
root
beer
barrel
type
of
flavor
and
it
goes
down
quick
product
of
u
s
a
poured
into
a
nonic
a
deep
bronze
with
a
thinner
slight
off
white
headquite
a
deep
pour
for
a
bitter
light
toast
and
fruity
esters
mainly
in
the
nosea
noticable
hard
water
element
is
there
as
well
deeply
fruity
with
a
little
brown
sugar
on
the
palatenot
much
hop
presence
but
i
didnt
expect
much
of
one
either
this
is
a
malt
mavens
beer
here
with
its
big
fruity
esters
and
sweetish
basehopheads
may
pass
on
this
from
the
12
fl
oz
usabrewed
bottle
and
sampled
on
july
6
2011
the
pour
is
a
nice
looking
reddishamber
with
a
soft
silky
tan
head
that
always
remains
on
top
to
a
small
degree
the
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
and
reminds
me
of
newcastle
brown
ale
with
a
bit
more
punch
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
with
a
smooth
creaminess
on
the
tongue
the
taste
is
a
strange
marriage
of
sweet
sugar
and
pepper
tart
it
ended
dry
i
dont
know
what
the
actual
price
of
these
would
be
when
found
on
the
shelf
as
opposed
to
the
discount
bin
but
i
would
recommend
trying
some
if
you
can
find
then
a
good
session
beer
with
the
non
noticeable
alcohol
level
the
beer
is
a
rich
mahogany
color
topped
with
a
head
tan
bubbles
that
settles
quickly
the
flavor
kicks
off
with
loads
of
biscuit
malt
followed
by
subtle
hops
warming
alcohol
notes
linger
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
full
and
roundnot
tongue
coating
but
nicely
comforting
a
step
up
from
killians
the
ingredients
come
together
quite
well
and
make
for
a
tasty
and
very
sessionable
bitter
overall
simple
thin
easydrinking
stuff
if
thats
what
youre
into
these
days
started
off
with
an
unimpressive
smell
i
got
a
sour
maltyyeasty
scent
clear
amber
color
with
light
foaming
watery
light
mouthfeel
tastes
of
caramel
and
toffee
but
a
little
on
the
salty
side
left
a
faint
aftertaste
of
bread
overall
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
rjt
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
copper
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
thin
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
a
hint
of
butter
in
the
aroma
with
some
figs
as
well
taste
is
vinous
oaky
and
earthy
flavors
to
start
with
a
wheat
bread
flavored
middle
and
a
tealike
herbal
grassy
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
carbonation
is
slightly
high
for
the
style
drinkability
is
very
good
the
low
alcohol
and
nice
flavors
make
this
a
nice
drinker
for
sure
d
would
definitely
work
well
as
a
session
beer
especially
with
such
a
light
abv
3
8
or
indeed
on
its
own
wow
what
a
treat
this
is
clearly
a
great
pick
if
in
need
of
a
solid
session
ale
great
job
on
this
one
d
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
sessionable
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
even
though
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
d
the
very
soft
muted
flavor
in
could
mean
that
it
is
an
old
beer
or
just
a
bit
bland
there
were
no
off
flavors
noticed
nice
flavors
to
be
found
in
this
bitter
but
the
above
average
carbonation
makes
it
less
pleasing
than
it
should
be
notes
well
its
decently
drinkable
cheers
drinks
fairly
easy
not
all
that
but
i
could
do
2
or
3
before
moving
on
fairly
on
style
but
no
shining
example
to
be
sure
d
nice
bitter
brew
that
keeps
you
wanting
more
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
a
bit
thin
some
odd
blended
flavoring
it
is
certainly
sessionable
abv
wise
but
there
are
better
representations
of
the
style
out
there
drinkability
is
not
good
there
is
a
bland
taste
that
makes
me
want
to
not
finish
the
beer
clear
dark
amber
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lace
on
the
glass
sweet
caramel
malt
and
marshmallow
with
a
touch
of
wintergreen
in
the
aroma
rich
biscuity
malt
flavors
and
not
much
else
going
on
here
it
seems
that
this
beer
is
geared
towards
macro
drinkers
who
might
want
something
slightly
more
flavorful
than
bmc
this
beer
is
along
the
lines
of
killians
or
honey
brown
fitting
since
it
is
actually
brewed
by
high
falls
light
bodied
with
bright
carbonation
a
pretty
boring
beer
imo
overall
overall
this
beer
is
ok
its
better
than
its
brother
legbiter
but
again
its
not
a
beer
id
go
out
of
my
way
looking
for
not
overly
impressive

a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
high
at
that
this
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
there
isnt
a
high
flavor
in
this
good
drinker
for
someone
who
is
just
starting
into
craft
beer
also
good
for
someone
who
wants
to
drink
import
but
not
something
from
bmc
this
is
my
first
english
bitter
and
i
was
not
disappointed
i
am
a
big
fan
of
fullers
esb
and
i
guess
i
judge
all
bitters
to
that
standard
but
since
this
beer
is
classified
as
just
a
bitter
and
not
an
esb
i
need
to
rethink
my
perception
of
what
this
beer
should
be
it
has
hops
but
not
to
the
extreme
it
has
flavor
good
aroma
and
tastes
good
i
am
happy
to
have
drunk
my
first
bitter
st
patrick
rules
d
pretty
drinkable
especially
for
a
beer
this
low

alcohol
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
the
aromatics
alone
made
me
feel
like
i
was
drinking
an
ale
in
a
nice
meadow
this
is
a
very
floralnot
overly
hopped
and
malty
beer
not
the
most
complex
but
very
good
d
this
makes
a
nice
session
ale
and
was
fun
to
crack
open
on
st
patricks
day
overall
crisp
and
clean
without
any
strong
or
heavy
flavorsaromas
drinkability
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
but
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
theres
nothing
exactly
wrong
with
it
but
its
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
tea
character
comes
across
in
the
taste
especially
when
it
warms
malty
and
lower
in

pretty
straightforward
not
bad
though

a
pretty

this

even

this
beer
is

mundane
its
still
very
drinkable
at
4
2
abv
according
to
the
bottle
these
go
down
very
easy
i
could
easily
put
down
more
than
one
at
a
time
very
little
to
stimulate
the
sense
of
smell
slight
hops
the
taste
was
a
dull
hop
taste
with
a
freshness
saving
the
brew
making
it
a
decent
enough
thirst
quencher
could
be
drank
as
a
session
beer
low
alcohol
and
nothing
offensive
but
could
get
a
bit
boring
reasonable
a
good
little
session
beer
this
beer
was
a
big
suprise
a
light
and
drinkable
bitter
looks
great
tastes
a
little
boring
overall
this
is
another
fairly
ubiquitous
brew
locally
and
one
of
the
few
bitters
ive
found
in
clear
bottles
im
wondering
whether
or
not
this
is
a
factor
in
the
excessive
amount
of
diacetyl
flavours
i
noticed
because
this
beer
really
doesnt
do
much
for
me
out
of
the
bottle
draught
might
be
a
different
matter
less
chance
of
being
lightstruck
for
a
start
so
there
may
be
a
case
for
having
this
on
draught
and
rereviewing
all
in
all
disappointing
overall
this
beer
seems
to
be
everywhere
now
i
have
had
great
experiences
with
the
brewerys
other
beers
but
this
one
was
a
complete
let
down
the
smell
and
taste
are
closer
to
lager
than
anything
else
and
the
mouth
feel
is
plain
annoying
but
the
actual
taste
is
not
too
bad
if
you
just
imagine
you
are
drinking
a
lager
beer
which
seems
to
have
become
ubiquitous
in
the
last
couple
of
years
pours
from
500ml
bottle
a
dark
amber
colour
with
minimal
head
or
maybe
that
was
down
to
a
poor
pour
the
nose
is
malty
brown
sugar
toffee
and
carrot
tangy
beer
with
a
fruity
start
becoming
sweeter
and
a
rather
metallic
finish
definitely
malt
dominated
and
less
salty
than
i
recall
the
cask
version
being
not
unpleasant
but
could
do
with
more
assertive
hops
o
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
from
drinking
previously
will
buy
it
again
maybe
this
is
an
off
batch
or
drinking
it
cold
is
muting
the
flavours
oi
have
had
a
few
of
these
here
and
i
have
enjoyed
them
quite
a
bit
a
nice
easy
drinking
ale
with
a
lot
of
flavor
it
had
a
great
color
of
a
cask
ale
maroon
transparent
but
not
watery
decent
head
i
was
looking
forward
to
it
but
when
i
drank
it
it
had
almost
no
flavor
whatsoever
it
was
watery
had
no
real
personality
reminded
me
of
dishwater
almost
shouldve
gotten
a
stella
instead
jury
out
go
figure
in
terms
of
a
numbers
review
flavorful
and
refreshing
taste
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
spices
and
caramel
not
so
bitter
fast
finish
with
oranges
and
mild
dry
good
smooth
beer
a
basic
english
bitter
here
and
nothing
to
get
particularly
exciting
about
it
it
was
an
easy
drink
to
consume
and
goes
down
well
despite
being
a
little
plain
o
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
wouldnt
seek
out
a
bottle
of
it
would
like
to
see
how
the
cask
version
varies
the
most
average
beer
that
ive
ever
rated
on
this
site
in
the
long
run
could
become
a
little
heavy
so
to
avoid
on
summer
days
but
interesting
at
other
times
its
drinkable
enough
and
decent
enough
not
huge
but
smooth
and
quaffable
o
good
session
beer
not
overwhelming
but
was
well
worth
trying
this
is
a
true
british
session
beer
cheers
sweetish
thin
and
flat
so
easy
to
slam
if
youre
into
that
may
explain
its
popularity

to

pleasant
surprise
poured
with

very
good

excellent

clean
definitely
a
session
a
plain
old
pint
of
bitter
no
trouble
to
sip
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
ground
breaking
but
very
drinkable
worth
a
try
it
is
velvety
smooth
and
pleasant
like
the
cornish
coaster
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
from
sharps
had
this
out
of
a
gravity
fed
cask
at
the
bree
louise
near
euston
station
dark
amber
in
colour
with
plenty
of
resinous
hop
aroma
and
flavour
big
malt
backing
and
full
mouth
feel
it
being
a
rare
sunny
day
in
london
and
the
beer
a
little
warmer
than
an
aussie
is
use
to
i
found
the
4
alcohol
less
drinkable
than
some
of
the
other
ales
i
sampled
a
camra
beer
of
the
year
2004
award
is
promising
but
also
raises
the
bar
of
expectations
but
this
brew
doesnt
need
to
hide
itself
medium
bodied
but
fully
flavored
and
balanced
resinous
spices
overshadowed
by
a
palate
of
succulent
dried
figs
and
mangos
great
cornish
ale
the
beer
just
doesnt
taste
right
to
me
too
sweet
especially
in
the
aftertaste
it
has
an
almost
sickly
smooth
feel
to
it
very
strange
for
an
english
bitter
md
lightbodied
and
very
livelytextured
its
a
easydrinking
standard
bitter
that
is
not
to
excite
but
to
quench
ones
thirst
good
quality
though

abv
this
is
an
oddball
to
say
the
least
upon
opening
the
beer
it
launched
white
foam
all
over
the
kitchen
and
continued
to
spew
foam
slowly
the
entire
time
even
after
most
of
it
was
poured
into
a
glass
there
was
about
one
part
beer
5
parts
lacey
head
from
a
gentle
pour
very
strange
the
nose
is
odd
too
its
got
a
dusty
sort
of
smell
ancient
in
a
way
exhumed
the
yeast
is
spicy
and
heavy
while
the
hops
are
unique
oily
and
crisp
the
flavor
has
some
of
that
same
dusty
vibe
but
has
a
finish
that
reminds
me
of
the
hop
extract
oils
ive
tasted
pungent
and
powerful
long
lasting
the
mouthfeel
is
different
as
well
its
heavier
from
all
the
yest
suspended
within
but
its
made
really
light
by
all
the
delicate
foam
you
cant
help
but
fill
your
mouth
with
on
each
sip
11
2
ounces
of
this
was
enough
for
me
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
of
a
kind
beer
really
out
of
the
box
brew
here
worth
a
try
oits
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
different
not
much
like
an
english
bitter
at
all
its
more
like
a
mix
between
a
great
belgian
and
tonic
its
a
fine
drinker
though
ill
enjoy
the
whole
bottle
but
i
wont
be
getting
more
o
i
love
it
when
a
brewer
can
coerce
this
much
flavor
out
of
a
sub
4
5
beer
very
enjoyable
brew
not
terribly
representative
of
an
english
bitter
but
its
absolutely
packed
with
aroma
and
flavor
for
something
with
just
4
5
abv
o
very
good
drinkability
would
love
to
have
a
case
or
two
of
this
in
my
cellar
enjoyed
this
enough
i
will
be
looking
out
for
it
in
the
future
hopefully
at
a
lower
us

2
oz
bottle
from

cerrito
market
batch
695
pours
almost
all
white
head
i
had
to
wait
some
time
for
it
to
dissipate
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
active
carbonation
aroma
has
some
grass
hay
bread
and
some
lush
tropical
fruits
taste
is
sweet
with
a
weird
bitterness
to
it
metallic
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
dry
finish
the
offtaste
was
distracting
but
i
could
catch
a
good
enough
glimpse
of
the
beer
to
see
what
it
was
i
would
like
to
try
again
to
see
if
i
had
an
older
bottle
o
this
beer
is
light
but
has
a
nice
ethereal
spicing
quality
to
it
o
the
beer
is
a
remarkable
take
on
the
style
and
is
definitely
a
lot
more
interesting
compared
to
bitters
brewed
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
north
sea
the
light
body
makes
this
beer
easy
to
drink
and
the
citrus
aromas
and
taste
lend
refreshing
qualities
a
nice
light
slightly
hoppy
beer
slainte
but
spend
your
bitterdollars
elsewhere
this
starts
out
as
a
very
lively
brew
with
a
massive
head
as
you
pour
it
makes
you
wait
to
finish
the
pour
upon
finishing
the
pour
the
sediment
hits
the
glass
and
gets
kicked
around
by
all
the
bubbles
in
there
the
look
of
the
beer
is
not
a
foggy
yellow
gold
and
cannot
see
through
it
anymore
the
beer
has
a
very
little
spicy
note
to
the
finish
along
with
some
banana
in
the
mix
the
bitterness
is
there
in
the
beginning
and
it
sticks
around
for
a
little
not
a
bad
beer
something
has
to
be
wrong
with
this
d
if
you
dont
mind
the
somewhat
extreme
carbonation
which
is
common
for
belgiandutch
ales
of
the
style
youll
love
this
one
definitely
an
all
night
drinker
notes
one
of
the
most
unassuming
offerings
from
de
molen
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
try
and
again
quite
a
pleasing
ride
not
overtly
complex
or
remarkable
but
in
its
simplicity
and
flow
it
felt
mighty
good
pours
a
clear
golden
color
one
and
one
half
inch
head
of
a
white
color
there
is
some
suspended
sediment
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
hops
citrus
slight
floral
hint
of
tea
hint
of
tart
malt
and
slight
yeast
the
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
fits
the
style
of
an
english
bitter
tastes
of
slight
pale
malt
yeast
hint
of
tart
malt
dry
hops
and
hint
of
tea
overall
good
body
blend
aroma
and
appearance
the
beer
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
flowers
and
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
is
very
similar
with
a
few
additions
the
dominant
flavors
are
biscuit
malt
and
floral
hops
but
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
grassyness
from
the
hops
as
i
continue
to
drink
the
beer
the
flavor
gets
a
little
bit
medicinal
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
no
thank
you
i
use
soap
to
clean
my
glasses
but
dont
drink
the
soapy
water
afterward
d
this
was
just
a
strange
beer
it
had
qualities
of
a
witbier
a
belgian
pale
and
a
bitter
but
i
cant
say
that
any
of
them
worked
all
that
well
cloudy
orange
with
a
white
head
a
pleasant
wheat
nose
with
a
medthin
mouthfeel
medium
hop
bitter
with
a
light
malt
flavor
pleasant
and
subtle
nice
witbier
character
but
a
bit
simple
all
around
coming
from
this
great
brewer
its
not
an
english
bitter
its
very
much
a
northern
european
pale
ale
id
say
the
style
should
be
bjcp
16b
belgian
pale
ale
however
its
lovely
very
nice
refreshing
when
cold
rich
warm
fruity
when
warm
complex
all
the
way
through
very
tasty
very
nice
beer
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
medium
body
for
the
style
and
soft
carbonation
hell
of
a
bitter
overall
overall
i
believe
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
hop
unless
its
belgian
for
a
more
commonly
used
hop
and
while
not
groundbreaking
it
imparts
some
nice
flavors
worth
a
shot
light
creamy
early
textures
fade
quickly
to
a
fleeting
dryness
reminescent
of
cask
ales
well
attenuated
and
refreshing
with
an
effortless
ease
of
drinking
this
is
a
solid
bitter
that
is
pretty
light
on
flavor
but
still
very
very
sessionable
d
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
d
good
overall
flavour
and
a
lightbodied
makes
this
exceptionally
quaffable
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
stuff
conclusion
i
bought
two
bottles
but
i
wish
it
was
two
cases
33cl

engelswith
an

a
cloudy
caramel
color
with
a
billowing
rocky
white
head
that
lasts
it
eventually
recedes
to
leave
thick
lacing
interesting
estery
smell
with
notes
of
fruit
and
bubblegum
not
really
characteristic
of
a
bitter
but
great
nonetheless
grassy
hops
and
some
lemon
light
caramel
malt
in
the
background
very
pleasant
tasting
with
prominent
aromatic
hop
notes
sharp
refreshing
bitterness
yeasty
fruity
taste
again
with
some
citrus
very
light
roastiness
at
the
end
bonedry
finish
medium
body
with
high
carbonation
great
utterly
drinkable
stuff
i
would
classify
this
as
a
saison
actually
though
with
british
caramel
malt
used
to
cut
the
usual
belgian
pils
bottle
courtesy
absumaster
pours
malty
a
bit
funky
smelling
white
parachute
head
that
leaves
but
a
littl
lace
light
body
underneath
that
has
an
understated
bitterness
to
it
understated
carbonation
medium
mouthfeel
with
some
mouth
tingling
drinkable
drying
aftertaste
taste
was
flowery
somewhat
soapy
with
some
malt
and
light
caramellic
flavors
the
bitterness
was
just
right
for
an
english
bitter
and
hop
taste
was
typical
english
the
body
was
thin
and
drinkability
was
good
md
the
mouthfeel
is
the
weakest
link
in
this
beer
as
its
thinish
and
softfizziness
of
caskconditioning
is
in
absence
somehow
degrading
the
enjoyment
by
a
big
margin
the
unsettled
yeastiness
also
makes
the
flavour
all
the
more
muddy
and
offbalance
not
like
what
a
caskconditioned
ale
should
be
if
that
weakness
is
put
right
and
the
flavour
profile
becomes
more
balanced
im
sure
this
beer
could
be
a
real
success
great
effort
though
decent
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
bottle
was
over
a
year
out
of
date
but
i
decided
to
go
for
it
anyways
quite
overly
carbonated
which
i
attribute
to
the
additional
age
put
on
this
beer
overall
very
good
though
poured
at
a
perfect
temperature
with
a
huge
longlasting
offwhite
head
lots
of
clingy
lace
and
a
hazy
honey
amber
color
aroma
is
malt
hops
grain
flavor
is
complex
with
biscuit
malt
a
hint
of
caramel
some
fruit
spice
plenty
of
hops
yeast
and
carbonic
tang
body
is
a
little
watery
a
little
boozy
in
the
finish
overall
a
very
good
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
an
american
pub
glass
a
dark
reddish
honey
gold
hue
with
ample
beige
head
with
the
latter
retaining
its
shape
impressively
well
nose
is
extremely
bright
and
fruity
with
brisk
orange
juice
green
grape
grassy
and
floral
notes
tingling
the
nostrils
along
with
a
more
diffuse
honey
malty
sweetness
tastes
like
dilute
orange
juice
or
mixed
citrus
iced
tea
green
herbs
dry
peppery
spice
a
little
medicinal
aspirin
a
initial
touch
of
canned
peach
that
becomes
more
salient
over
the
course
of
many
sips
and
a
pleasant
lightly
toasted
caramel
malt
backbone
i
sorta
get
the
english
bitter
comparisons
but
this
is
hopped
with
amarillo
man
closely
resembles
many
of
the
brews
currently
sold
as
american
session
ipas
in
flavor
profile
noticeably
watery
body
which
others
have
also
described
and
this
certainly
mutes
the
overall
flavor
impact
to
some
extent
i
did
not
find
the
beer
to
be
overly
fizzy
and
from
this
and
the
abv
standpoint
does
drink
like
an
english
ale
tangy
medicinal
gently
bitter
finish
the
amarillo
tastes
great
in
here
albeit
mellow
and
overall
i
am
down
or
up
for
another
and
another
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
massive
half
glass
head
that
slowly
dissipates
leaving
massive
lacing
foamed
a
bit
out
of
the
bottle
pleasant
aroma
of
bready
malt
citrus
and
grassy
hops
light
orange
flavor
is
orange
citrus
and
citrus
hops
mild
caramel
malt
earthy
mint
family
herbs
finishes
with
grassy
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
a
grassy
somewhat
subdued
ipa
but
well
flavored
for
the
abv
this
does
lean
in
profile
to
classic
english
ipa
style
but
north
american
northwest
hops
are
also
evident
nice
variation
on
an
ipa
and
tasty
for
a
session
ale
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
bitter
but
i
tasted
more
interested
beers
from
de
molen
this
beer
through
me
off
a
bit
it
is
pretty
darn
good
but
at
times
really
seemed
to
border
between
esb
and
english
ipa
if
thats
possible
i
seem
to
detect
more
of
the
malt
presence
especially
in
the
nose
than
many
other
reviewers
a
likable
beer
which
is
made
for
the
afternoon
great
beer
with
excellent
drinkability
c
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
orangey
yellow
there
are
a
ton
of
floral
hop
notes
and
a
hint
of
orange
marmalade
in
the
nose
so
its
not
surprising
to
encounter
a
very
big
hop
presence
on
the
palate
its
not
at
all
unbalanced
and
in
fact
the
fine
carbonation
helps
make
this
very
drinkable
meh
i
had
no
issues
drinking
it
whatsoever
in
fact
it
went
down
quickly
so
that
says
something
with
all
the
selection
here
in
alberta
you
could
spend
your
money
on
something
better
a
decent
enough
ipa
oldworld
style
with
a
whiff
of
those
newfangled
hops
so
all
is
well
here
nothing
overbearing
nothing
underwhelming
just
a
nice
drinkable
somewhat
hoppy
ale
overall
if
youre
out
on
a
hot
day
this
is
the
one
you
want
to
drink
its
light
easygoing
but
lovely
balanced
in
flavor
its
just
has
that
little
zip
of
flavor
that
most
other
beers
in
regular
bars
dont
deliver
i
actually
love
this
one
the
ultimate
perfumy
flavor
aroma
and
peppery
dryness
remind
me
a
lot
of
highly
hopped
belgian
ales
oddly
compelling
the
grass
herb
and
flowery
character
come
together
in
a
rather
pleasant
rendition
of
pale
ale
that
defies
style

i
love
the

on
this

though

thats
how
i
like
it
overall
a
very
nice

beer
very
refreshing
by
no

even
remotely
close

still
an
good

in

o
an

with
some
american

in

highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
good
as
a

with

it
leaves

yes
the

bitterness
and
overall
comes
across
to
me
as
good
english
bitter
rather
than
a
great
eipa
but
in
saying
that
very
drinkable
ive
had
much
better
from
de
molen
while
this
has
good
things
going
for
it
it
ends
up
a
relatively
insipid
beer
overall
drinkable
in
its
way
and
it
has
its
place
in
the
extensive
de
molen
range
but
it
has
a
hard
job
to
stand
up
on
its
own
d
a
nice
ipa
but
im
quite
surprised
that
its
an
english
ipa
the
american
hops
amarillo
and
cascade
are
quite
obvious
nice
though
overall
a
very
nice
and
unique
ipa
i
appreciate
the
low
alcohol
content
which
adds
to
the
general
drinkability
however
though
i
would
readily
drink
another
in
the
future
its
features
are
such
that
one
is
plenty
at
any
given
sitting
not
bad
maybe
more
american
than
english
in
the
ipa
style
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
apples
and
grain
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
apples
and
lemons
as
well
as
some
grassy
grain
and
wheat
low
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
pretty
good
overall
overall
a
good
beer
just
nice
for
a
session
beer
at
4
5
not
much
complexity
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
amarillo
beer
from
de
molen
as
well
they
both
use
amarillo
hops
d
real
easy
to
drink
light
and
flavorful
good
for
a
warm
summer
day
this
bitter
pours
a
some
what
hazy
pale
or
dull
orange
little
or
no
head
to
speak
of
scent
is
yeasty
and
musty
a

taste
is
more
malty
than
yeasty
but
with

mustiness
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
taste
has
some
caramel
notes
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
overall
a
decent
bitter
this
beer
needs
to
warm
a
bit
d
very
very
easy
to
drink
not
overpowering
and
i
cannot
believe
any
beer
can
taste
this
good
at
this

ive
got

mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
simple
carbonation
the
finish
has
a
slightly
thick
feel
to
it
kind
of
like
the
aftertaste
of
syrup
no
sign
of
any
booziness
i
know
that
the
style
is
easy
going
but
i
find
myself
bored
after
half
a
glass
i
guess
session
beers
like
this
are
somewhat
lost
on
hop
heads
like
me
a
good
brew
but
i
wouldnt
waste
more
time
on
it
life
is
to
short
to
drink
simple
just
ok
beer
pours
a
clear
honey
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
little
bits
of
lacing
here
and
there
but
not
much
theres
is
lots
of
earth
tones
in
the
nose
picking
up
dirt
grass
hay
wheat
there
is
also
a
nice
sweet
honey
smell
that
finishes
with
a
lemon
scent
the
taste
is
of
sweet
honey
and
rough
grains
it
has
a
pleasant
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
clean
carbonation
nice
and
crisp
i
cant
believe
i
hadnt
tried
this
beer
sooner
i
loved
it
this
might
be
a
new
regular
for
me
drinkability
drinkable
but
probably
better
paired
with
a
steak
dinner
simple
earthy
low
abv
brew
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
light
clear
amber
yellow
smell
light
and
malty
sweetness
some
dry
hop
crispness
taste
is
light
with
faint
malts
and
and
a
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
malts
and
the
light
hop
dryness
in
the
finish
good
session
beer
though
not
much
going
on
quite
drinkable
but
on
the
mundane
side
especially
for
a
samuel
smith
brew
d
at
a
3
8
abv
with
that
complex
and
full
of
a
flavor
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
it
paired
amazingly
with
a
japanese
style
paella
harmonizing
with
the
salty
sea
weed
flavors
of
the
dish
and
refreshing
my
palate
after
every
drink
drinkability
this
is
really
a
pretty
good
brew
in
my
opinion
its
different
from
most
i
like
the
change
of
pace
however
i
dont
think
i
could
make
an
evening
of
it
cheers
nice
low
abv
brew
looks
like
a
good
candidate
for
lunch
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
yields
a
nice
molasses
smell
with
hints
of
cinnamon
pouring
into
a
pint
i
get
a
nice
cloudy
brownish
yellow
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
taste
is
much
like
that
to
be
expected
for
an
english
ale
sweet
malts
well
balanced
with
a
lightly
bitter
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
however
not
super
robust
but
for
the
abv
that
should
be
expected
the
aftertaste
is
delightful
with
a
fading
bitter
sweetness
that
encourages
another
sip
this
is
the
king
of
session
brews
by
far
drinkability
with
this
abv
is
off
the
scale
slainte
a
decent
brew
def
not
the
class
of
the
sam
smith
brewery
this
was
a
nice
casual
drinking
experience
this
beer
is
very
pc
it
would
be
hard
to
find
this
offensive
smells
ciderish
light
opaque
sharp
golden
enjoyable
color
butter
malt
fruit
hop
mix
that
fades
through
as
the
malt
pass
pleasant
aftertaste
mild
hop
bitterness
overall
good
just
a
bit
surprised
that
its
only
3
8
in
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
creamy
and
has
that
very
nice
antique
toffee
flavor
a
touch
of
diacetyl
in
there
as
well
the
sweetish
malts
really
come
through
and
there
is
just
a
touch
of
leafy
hop
to
dry
things
up
a
bit
the
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
drying
leafy
hop
really
defines
the
beer
there
could
be
some
other
floral
buttery
hints
in
there
too
but
the
medium
body
creamy
texture
and
the
aforementioned
characteristics
define
this
beer
it
is
quite
nice
lchaim
goes
down
pretty
easily
with
a
good
flavor
not
a
bad
brew

d
this
seems
to
be
a

beer
one
could
have
several
throughout
the
meal
and
be
very
satisfied
it
was
very
good
between
45
and
55
degrees
overall
i
had
mixed
emotions
when
i
saw
this
beer
i
first
drank
tadcaster
bitter
from
the
handpump
in
cask
conditioned
format
at
the
general
elliott
in
leeds
in
1987
as
it
happened
weeks
before
it
was
withdrawn
from
that
format
now
it
is
only
sold
in
its
brewery
conditioned
keg
format
having
had
both
i
much
preferred
the
softer
feel
this
had
on
cask
obviously
but
the
fact
that
sams
dont
add
any
nasty
headache
inducing
adjuncts
does
make
this
a
decent
enough
keg
beer
though
and
its
a
pretty
drinkable
bitter
on
cask
in
stamford
very
smooth
distinct
fruity
taste
hints
of
oak
very
pleasing
a
malty
juice
not
really
that
fun
an
average
real
ale
o
a
lovely
daytime
beer
very
mild
flavour
but
somewhat
satisfying
overall
impression
typical
bitter
flavor
nothing
spectacular
fairly
weak
bodied
to
be
honest
bitter
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
with
a
great
appearance
and
a
nice
balance
throughout
there
was
some
nice
caramel
malts
and
the
hints
of
fruit
were
nice
too

i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
consuming
i
definitely
recommend
this
on
cask
still
under
2
00
a
pint
in
an
historic
central
london
pub
oct
2011
you
cant
go
wrong
in
fact
i
had
another
half
in
the
beautiful
princess
louise
half
an
hour
after
rinsing
this
pint
ive
just
reviewed
so
so
sam
smith
do
great
pubs
i
love
their
porter
and
barley
wine
but
this
is
the
definition
of
mediocrity
at
best
cheers
od
high
dinkability
as
this
is
tasty
and
low
abv
a
good
beer
with
depth
and
interesting
parts
coming
together
as
you
go
a
good
one
but
nothing
crazy
a
decent
enough
bitter
certainly
sessionable
d
not
a
session
beer
for
most
due
to
the
bitterness
but
look
at
the
name
i
really
enjoyed
it
my
favorite
sam
smith
a
good
solid
ale
ontap
at
the
earl
of
lonsdale
at
portobello
rd
d
usually
have
three
in
one
sitting
attesting
to
the
exceptional
drinkability
of
this
awesome
ale
pours
a
lovely
amber
with
a
dense
white
head
with
firm
bubbles
from
tap
nitro
i
believe
at
a
company
pub
in
oxford
the
aroma
has
very
low
levels
of
earthy
uk
hops
this
is
a
very
estery
beer
pears
and
apples
raisiny
caramel
notes
lead
the
flavor
with
low
levels
of
bittering
hops
complemented
by
low
flavor
hops
and
noticeable
esters
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
with
a
medium
body
oncask
at
the
cock
in
london
appeared
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
tall
white
head
eh
nice
and
drinkable
but
a
bit
plain
the
aroma
is
just
a
sharp
sweet
mellon
note
and
a
plain
bready
flavor
very
drinkable
and
it
fits
well
into
the
style
worth
a
try
is
youre
into
sam
smith
beers
but
understand
this
isnt
at
the
same
level
as
the
taddy
porter
or
oatmeal
stout
a
splendid
bitter
warning
the
same
beer
could
be
very
bland
when
served
on
tap
overchilled
or
dispensed
carelessly
in
another
samuel
smiths
pub
with
poor
bartraining
and
cellarmanship
though
pours
a
clear
rich
orangeyamber
with
a
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
lacing
sweet
and
fruity
malts
in
the
nose
with
discernable
oak
notes
not
too
powerful
but
present
sweet
malts
up
front
with
fruity
notes
of
pear
green
apple
and
peach
leading
to
a
lingering
earthy
hop
bitterness
with
definite
oak
overtones
lovely
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
was
excited
to
try
a
sam
smith
on
cask
from
a
wood
cask
at
that
old
brewery
bitter
was
a
solid
copper
color
topped
by
a
thin
white
head
lacing
was
smattered
about
and
on
the
thin
side
sweet
malt
aroma
is
strong
yet
inviting
sweet
malt
and
hop
is
prevalent
in
a
long
finish
seems
well
balanced
and
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
had
it
at
the
wonderful
citte
of
york
pub
in
london
this
is
beer
from
the
wood
drawn
from
an
oak
cask
an
orange
amber
color
with
a
light
beige
head
the
aroma
was
lighty
sweet
with
a
hint
of
apple
a
malty
sweetness
starts
out
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
followed
by
an
even
smooth
bitterness
througout
the
rest
ot
the
tongue
this
is
one
the
very
few
beers
that
are
still
served
from
oak
casks
i
know
because
i
saw
the
cooper
making
the
casks
a
the
brewery
smooth
and
drinks
well
pleasantly
light
body
this
beer
had
a
unique
taste
bitter
is
definitely
the
operative
term
as
this
beer
is
very
bitter
i
liked
it
ok
but
could
not
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
sucking
on
a
lemon
the
beers
appearance
is
intriguing
i
wonder
if
this
is
a
more
popular
beer
in
the
uk
where
it
probably
compliments
the
blander
taste
of
the
food
there
this
beer
had
a
medium
sized
head
that
contained
finemedium
sized
bubbles
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
orange
and
it
produced
a
decent
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
to
me
it
has
a
fruity
citrusy
nose
this
is
definitely
a
bitter
tasting
beer
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
however
it
wasnt
that
bad
i
had
this
in
what
was
supposed
to
be
the
oldest
pub
in
london
the
old
cheshire
cheese
the
beer
was
a
rich
copper
color
a
bit
of
a
lingering
head
there
was
a
slightly
sweet
maltiness
to
the
aroma
there
was
as
full
malty
taste
to
this
one
with
a
hine
of
bitterness
coming
through
at
the
end
very
good
sit
and
have
a
plesant
conversation
with
drinkability
i
was
in
heaven
getting
samuel
smith
on
tap
a
truly
amazing
experience
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
with
the
relatively
low
alcohol
content
of
4
abv
you
could
drink
these
all
night
speaking
from
experience
i
think
i
paid
2
pounds
50
pence
per
pint
roughly
3
75
and
it
was
worth
every
cent
if
you
find
yourself
in
london
anytime
soon
check
out
cittie
of
yorke
if
only
you
could
have
tasted
their
museum
ale
on
cask

oh
it
was
wonderous
pretty
ordinary
sweet
creamy
mouthfeel
ok
maltiness
not
much
bitterness
not
much
hoppyness
smooth
aswell
and
tasted
very
very
flat
lacks
bite
and
once
again
this
is
a
bit
to
sweet
and
creamy
for
me
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
brew
in
one
of
the
oldest

this

would
be

the
tartness
perhaps
masks
some
of

would
make
this

fatigue
problem
over
the

of
a
long

not

bad
of

abv

take
this
over

virtually
any

good
beer
malty

drinkable

this
is
a
must
try
very
anyone
who
likes
a
good
ale
overall
as
an
english
bitter
this
one
works
for
me
eh
unsure
if
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
id
say
it
could
definitely
go
with
food
great
looking
beer
bit
somewhat
lacking
in

and
taste
huge
fan
of
the
giipa
tried
this
beer
at
my
local
dc
pub
great
hoppy
beginning
with
a
really
citrus
finish
really
easy

english
ale

as
well
as
from
some
of
my
chicagobased

is
a
pretty
decent
reproduction
of
an
english
session
bitter
but
not
really
anything
to
get
terribly
excited
about
id
not
refuse
it
if
offered
but
id
not
actively
seek
it
out
either
boring
beer
pours
a
light
copper
with
very
little
head
smells
of
some

but
not
much
transfers
to
flavor
very
thin
and
mostly
bland
not
bad
and
quite
drinkable
just
not
very
interesting
reminds
me
of
a
light
brown
ale
or
a
michelob

light
malt
caramel
and
honey
sweetness
everything
is
light
for
a

abv
this
makes
for
a

that
most
could
easily
drink
several
of
nothing
i
would
go
looking
for
but
a

easy
pleasant

english
bitter
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
nice
light
amber
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
consisted
of
bread
and
wheat
scents
with
some
grassy
notes
from
the
hops
the
taste
was
mild
yet
very
refreshing
with
mostly
the
malt
being
the
focal
point
until
the
end
where
there
was
a
nice
crisp
finish
a
great
everyday
kind
of
beer

lets
just
say
i
wouldnt
be
at
all
sad
if
i
had
to
kill
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
in
a
sitting
not
overly
bold
but
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
drank
more
like
an
american
take
off
on
an
octoberfest
than
an
english
bitter
too
sweet
for
me
i
love
bitter
and
cut
my
beer
teeth
in
england
i
find
this
to
be
as
good
a
bitter
as
i
got
in
many
places
there
and
better
than
others
i
have
had
here
i
am
a
cellar
temperature
beer
fan
because
freezing
cold
beer
ruins
the
taste
i
let
this
one
sit
for
a
couple
of
minutes
after
the
pour
into
a
dimpled
mug
and
felt
right
at
home
mate
sitting
in
banbury
at
the
dog
and
gun
rated
it
a
4
5
instead
of
a
5
easy
drinking
beer
but
low
abv
so
it
kinda
defeats
the
purpose
i
judge
my
beer
by
ibus
and
abv
p
s
just
noticed
the
abv
is
a
mere
4
3
so
whats
the
point
overall
it
comes
up
just
short
of
great
this
beer
has
a
great
flavor
but
doesnt
offer
up
enough
flavor
with
that
said
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
will
satisfy
your
craving
very
tasty
the
price
is
also
very
good
wisconsin
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
not
great
drinkable
but
not
memorable
beer
because
the
hop
flavors
are
very
tasty
the
price
is
also
a
big
plus
honkers
ale
is
another
okay
offering
from
goose
island
which
finds
itself
sandwiched
between
the
better
more
drinkable
312
urban
wheat
ale
and
the
lesser
ten
hills
pale
ale
you
could
definitely
session
this
as
its
abv
is
very
low
and
it
has
just
enough
body
to
be
a
sustainable
beverage
even
if
you
only
plan
to
have
one
its
a
mixed
bag
but
its
definitely
something
to
try
overall
that
last
sentence
says
it
all
to
me
i
like
this
beer
and
it
now
has
me
looking
for
other
english
bitters
that
is
the
mark
of
a
good
beer
honkers
never
was
a
great
beer
but
it
used
to
be
better
than
this
now
it
tastes
almost
like
a
macro
pours
a
pretty
mediumdarker
amber
in
color
with
about
a
half
of
a
finger
foamy
white
head
that
settles
down
pretty
fast
to
just
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
really
no
lacing
is
seen
to
speak
of
good
carbonation
the
aroma
has
a
lot
going
on
with
caramel
malts
bready
yeast
with
a
hint
of
citrus
maybe
orange
pretty
close
to
the
aroma
actually
with
a
hint
of
spice
with
some
sourness
with
a
slight
dry
finish
medium
bodied
different
than
some
other
brews
not
bad
but
not
my
style
of
brew
for
the
most
part
i
really
like
this
and
am
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
all
day
o
this
one
was
pretty
good
mostly
malt
driven
but
the
hop
characteristics
added
nice
character
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
spectrum
in
all
categories
but
very
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
i
will
likely
try
their
ipa
and
would
definitely
buy
this
again
being
a
huge
fan
of
english
ales
i
figured
i
would
like
this
i
immediately
loved
the
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
it
brought
back
memories
of
drinking
real
english
ales
on
a
flower
filled
patio
at
a
restaurant
in
bermuda
the
head
was
nice
12
inch
mouthfeel
good
satisfying
the
taste
was
good
but
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
hops
for
me
i
like
my
ales
slightly
maltier
but
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
bitter
will
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
o
a
nice
bitter
very
grassy
mouthfeel
is
top
notch
very
smooth
and
fluffy
easy
drinking
simple
but
sessionable
there
is
some
real
distinctive
character
in
the
taste
it
has
a
smooth
carmelly
feel
i
think
this
is
your
run
of
the
mill
pale
ale
which
means
i
love
it
there
wasnt
much
depth
in
the
aroma
really
had
to
patiently
work
to
get
what
i
got
a
nice
aroma
is
what
heightens
my
anticipation
and
senses
mouthfeel
mostly
light
watery
and
refreshing
has
a
somewhat
lager
like
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
although
there
is
some
of
the
fluffiness
which
should
be
present
in
the
english
bitter
style
flavor
well
balanced
hops
are
in
the
background
and
subservient
to
the
malt
flavors
include
a
peppery
and
earthy
hop
spice
a
rich
bready
malt
again
like
a
fresh
warm
muffin
or
a
fresh
whole
wheat
bread
there
is
some
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
cinnamon
this
beer
is
not
overly
sweet
and
the
aftertaste
has
a
lingering
citrus
rind
bitterness

a

offering
an

overwhelming
the
nose
of
this
beer
right
into
the
very
first
thing
youll
taste
as
it
hits
your
tongue
the
sweet
is
aided
with
a
smokey
body
throughout
balancing
this
ale
to
exceptional
levels
this
style
ale
may
not
be
for
everyone
though
the
sweet
smokey
and
bitter
characteristics
drive
this
beer
home
through
the
finish
which
doesnt
grab
me
as
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
from
what
has
become
more
popular
in
the
states
only
the
best
qualities
of
this
beer
tend
to
linger
leaving
this
as
a
great
beer
in
my
book
o
this
beer
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
it
is
a
drinking
beer
not
a
sipping
beer
as
such
it
would
go
great
at
cookouts
and
parties
i
would
like
to
have
three
or
four
of
these
if
i
were
going
to
have
some
beers
with
a
friend
unfortunately
it
was
my
one
for
the
night
and
left
me
a
little
unfulfilled
now
i
want
more
of
this
or
something
else
anything
would
suffice
at
this
point
a
little
too
light
for
my
personal
likes
of
an
english
bitter
but
very
drinkable
overall
a
really
nice
english
bitter
and
a
worthy
staple
in
midwest
bars
and
pubs
its
a
sip
in
my
opinion
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
prefer
a
little
more
malt
in
the
palate
up
front
d
pleasantly
surprising
a
great
example
of
the
style
goose
island
honkers
ale
3
55
overall
quite
a
tasty
session
ale
and
one
that
i
could
quaff
regularly
a
bit
dry
and
watery
although
malt
flavor
is
there
overall
im
kind
of
surprised
this
is
so
popular
not
because
its
bad
its
solid
but
because
the
taste
is
so
bitter
that
i
wouldnt
think
it
would
have
such
broad
appeal
i
had
a
pint
on
tap
because
everything
else
on
tap
was
either
something
ive
had
before
or
something
bad
i
could
see
myself
having
this
again
on
those
same
terms
o
a
perfect
summer
beer
and
a
solid
session
beer
at
4
2
abv
the
beer
i
had
was
about
2
12
months
old
and
it
was
still
quite
good
perhaps
a
bit
peachy
but
still
very
good
its
good
enough
that
ill
look
for
a
fresh
6pack
at
some
point
a
solid
brew
thats
easy
drinking
o
im
uninterested
ive
had
a
bad
night
cant
recall
a
more
floral
hop
dominated
beer
the
sweetness
is
a
touch
overwhelming
in
the
finish

a
good

i

i

id
recommend
this
to
anyone
whos
getting
into
craft
beer
o
ive
had
better
english
bitters
dba
comes
to
mind
as
well
as
surlys
offering
this
is
decent
but
not
special
overall
this
is
a
good
a
beer
it
is
touted
as
an
english
bitter
but
is
not
as
bitter
as
other
beers
ive
had
in
this
category
that
said
still
a
solid
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
will
enjoy
several
during
the
super
bowl
tonight
pours
a
beautiful
copper
with
perfect
clarity
and
a
dense
lingering
white
head
nose
is
of
biscuity
bready
malts
fruity
yeasts
some
buttery
undertones
taste
is
very
mild
with
chewy
minerals
and
grains
up

crisp
hop
bitterness
and
cooked
cereal
at
the
end
not
overly
carbonated
with
a
medium
thin
mouthfeel
very
english
in
character
and
light
enough
to
enjoy
several
at
a
sitting
a
true
english
style
bitter
they
call
this
a
brew
in
the
style
of
an
english
bitter
having
had
many
pints
of
bitter
across
many
pubs
in
the
south
and
middle
of
england
i
dont
think
it
compares
for
me
its
a
bit
too
malty
to
be
considered
a
pint
of
bitter
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
find
it
more
like
a
brown
ale
than
anything
else
and
since
im
a
true
ipa
guy
this
beer
left
me
disappointed
good
english
bitter
easy
to
session
perfect
for
what
it
is
and
what
they
advertise
it
to
be
overall
a
good
smooth
mediumlight
bodied
beer
with
a
slight
hoppy
finish
very
drinkable
o
this
is
one
of
goose
islands
better
brews
and
lucky
for
me
being
from
chicago
you
can
find
it
at
many
places
nowadays
a
great
session
ale
in
my
opinion
the
verdict
good
beer
an
esb
with
decent
balance
and
nice
flavor
this
one
surprised
me
i
wouldnt
mind
an
occasional
sixpack
i
remember
an
online
class
that
had
an
ebook
that
tracked
whether
or
not
you
read
or
listened
to
the
material
and
reported
it
to
the
instructor
well
the
joke
was
on
him
because
i
learned
very
little
and
drank
a
very
great
deal
of
honkers
ale
while
listening
this
is
definitely
goose
islands
best
macro
brew
in
my
opinion
it
is
thin
yet
bitter
and
the
taste
can
only
be
descried
as
unique
and
perfectly
balanced
worth
the
money
every
time
and
in
case
you
were
wondering
i
still
got
an
a
in
the
class
because
this
beer
really
made
me
relax
and
open
up
my
mind
to
philosophical
arguments
not
recommended
for
math
or
science
class
good
clean
beer
that
is
not
too
heavy
but
gives
some
solid
flavour
beyond
a
mass
produced
macro
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
slightly
red
hue
slight
head
and
lacing
that
doesnt
linger
slight
nose
of
pine
hops
against
a
sweet
background
light
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
taste
is
laid
back
with
a
mild
bitterness
predominating
a
light
sweetness
very
well
balanced
with
a
short
burst
of
mild
hop
flavor
that
is
balanced
between
pine
and
citrus
clean
crisp
finish
with
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
that
is
somewhat
tart
a
very
good
session

summary
good
beer
overall
just
between
very
good
and
outstanding
i
think
this
beer
is
under
rated
by
most
at
first
the
beer
tasted
very
bland
however
it
eventually
grew
on
me
i
enjoyed
it
but
im
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
it
didnt
seem
special
or
anything
instead
it
seemed
rather
plain
again
i
did
enjoy
it
but
i
wasnt
impressed
at
times
it
tasted
very
watered
down
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
extraordinary
o
honkers
ale
is
another
old
favorite
from
goose
island
and
i
am
more
than
satisfied
in
saying
this
classic
ale
hasnt
changed
since
the
buyout
still
the
same
ole
tasty
and
refreshing
honkers
ale
almost
a
relief
its
still
what
it
used
to
be
an
excellent
take
on
a
traditional
english
style
ill
continue
on
enjoying
honkers
ale
from
time
to
time
well
as
long
as
its
kept
the
same
and
not
tinkered
with
rjt
its
an
excellent
beer
d
this
was
an
easy
drinker
for
a
ballgame
but
probably
wont
try
it
again
o
not
my
favorite
ale
but
then
again
it
is
an
english
bitter
and
i
didnt
know
that
when
i
purchased
it
so
it
is
what
it
is
if
it
was
a
pale
ale
like
i
thought
it
was
i
would
have
rated
it
differently
and
lower
in
everything
than
appearance
i
feel
that
i
was
actually
generous
being
that
there
was
little
to
no
head
and
not
much
lacing
i
would
have
one
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
one
this
feels
lighter
and
more
sessionable
than
the
taste
reveals
a
very
tasty
ale
with
a
great
overall
appeal
pours
an
amber
hue
with
a
fairly
weak
head
nice
hoppy
malty
english
ale
a
bit
sweet
but
enjoyable
id
like
it
a
bit
more
dry
huge
nose
of
malt
full
body
is
a
bit
sticky
earthy
herbal
hops
finish
off
not
a
huge
fan
but
also
would
not
turn
one
down
o
good
beer
not
amazing
but
worth
a
try
overall
a
nice
session
ale
with
lots
of
flavor
a
great
american
take
on
a
classic
british
style
thats
not
common
over
here
o
i
like
it
but
i
dont
love
it
will
continue
to
buy
single
bottles
but
a
6
pack
would
be
a
stretch
o
not
bad
hop
presence
is
more
mild
than
i
anticipated
its
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
its
something
id
purchase
again
overall
a
decent
bitter
from
goose
island
and
with
such
a
low
abv
very
sessionable
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
pretty
standard
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
but
easy
to
pickup
if
its
there
20
ounces
come
to
the
table
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
smells
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
earthy
woody
hops
the
flavor
is
malty
sweet
and
rich
with
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
a
bit
of
earth
balances
nicely
medium
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
nothing
horribly
complex
but
a
nice
clean
flavorful
easy
drinking
ale
overall
this
was
pretty
boring
but
was
easy
to
drink
would
make
a
good
sessionhot
weather
beer
overall
this
beer
is
just
ok
the
flavor
is
decent
but
the
mouthfeel
is
not
i
really
enjoyed
my
first
goose
island
honkers
ale
another
beer
that
i
received
in
a
store
made
variety
pack
i
figured
it
would
be
a
good
one
to
try
before
trying
some
of
their
seasonals
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
standard
ale
glass
and
the
appearance
was
similar
to
samuel
adams
boston
lager
it
has
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
slight
orange
tint
the
beer
isnt
too
heavy
when
tasted
but
also
doesnt
lose
its
taste
quickly
either
my
overall
experience
with
the
beer
was
very
good
its
great
to
have
at
dinner
with
just
about
anything
a
bbq
or
even
just
while
youre
watching
tv
enjoy
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
it
scratches
a
major
itch
yet
is
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
this
is
highly
sessionable
with
the
added
bonus
of
the
carbonation
slowing
down
consumption
to
an
extent
being
a
connoisseur
of
all
things
british
cars
women
music
etc
i
can
say
this
is
certainly
not
that
said
it
is
still
a
very
good
beer
it
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
an
ample
head
finger
lacing
lasts
through
the
last
drink
and
the
taste
is
full
with
plentiful
malt
and
hops
flavors
which
are
in
no
way
overpowering
the
aroma
lies
somewhere
between
bread
and
walnuts
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
warming
without
being
too
thick
allinall
a
very
good
beer
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
coppery
amber
with
a
fine
two
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
and
light
grassy
hops
flavor
follows
with
biscuit
malt
and
light
nondescript
slightly
grassy
hops
mild
flavored
but
leaves
a
pleasant
lingering
malty
hop
aftertaste
light
to
medium
bodied
a
pleasant
but
light
flavored
domestic
take
on
an
english
bitter
malt
seems
just
right
for
the
style
moderately
bland
but
pleasant
while
it
doesnt
fully
capture
the
spirit
of
an
english
bitter
honkers
is
a
good
beer
in
its
own
right
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
at
only
4
2
o
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
overall
honkers
ale
is
billed
as
a
bitter
to
me
however
it
tastes
more
like
a
thin
ipa
this
beer
has
a
soda
pop
quality
to
it
as
its
sweet
and
fizzy
also
like
soda
pop
the
beer
leaves
no
lasting
impression
odd
its
not
a
bad
beer
i
love
the
color
the
whole
experience
is
just
a
little
lacking
however
beautiful
goose
island
doesnt
disappoint
me
and
more
often
than
not
they
keep
me
coming
back
whats
the
most
surprising
thing
about
this
beer
though
is
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
wow
i
mean
it
wasnt
watery
it
was
very
complex
and
hat
a
lot
of
aggressive
flavors
that
went
into
it
but
it
goes
down
really
smooth
i
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
surprised
by
how
full
bodied
and
complex
it
was
for
having
such
a
low
alcohol
content
im
pretty
impressed
and
will
probably
keep
this
at
the
back
of
my
head
when
i
need
something
a
little
different
than
what
i
usually
drink

overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
when
people
throw
this
one
out
there
as
a
good
session
candidate
i
can
very
easily
see
why
this
beer
has
lots
of
flavor
packed
in
with
an
attractively
low
abv
that
makes
it
a
good
one
for
having
several
over
the
course
of
an
evening
one
of
my
favorites
from
gi
along
with
their
englishstyle
ipa
the
smell
was
citrsy
and
lemony
slight
hint
of
nut
the
taste
was
bitter
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
bad
drink
easy
to
quaff
it
left
a
nice
bitterness
on
tongue
and
roof
of
the
mouth
i
got
a
sixer
of
this
one
at
haggen
so
i
will
see
it
goes
overall
this
is
a
great
american
ale
crisp
clean
full
of
flavor
with
a
long
finish
and
nicely
balanced
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
theres
a
lot
of
spice
going
on
too
that
im
not
used
to
in
an
english
bitter
that
just
kicks
this
ale
up
a
notch
i
love
this
beer
it
bids
itself
as
an
english
bitter

a
good
american
version
of
this
sublime
english
style
i
take
my
bitter
seriously
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
pours
redish
amber
in
color
and
definite
red
malt
trails
the
carbonation
is
quite
excited
quite
sessionable
just
lacking
in
the
flavor
department

to

around
with

seems
to
be

at

some
up

a

use
the
term
light
in

not

have

not
reviewed
this

until
now
a
midwestern
staple
beer
a
classic
reaper16nov

but
the
carbonation
was
spot
on
as
well
as
the
viscosity
this
drank
rather
well
but
smells
toasty
not
like
bread
but
toasted
malts
taste
is
very
nice
mildly
bitter
and
earthy
but
also
toffeelike
from
the
toasted
malts
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
tastes
of
some
mild
tealike
pleasantness
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
as
is
typical
for
standard
goose
beers
ahh
this
beer
is
what
i
imagine
an
authentic
english
bitter
to
be
like
and
it
is
highly
drinkable
could
this
be
the
perfect

with

cloudy
and
light
pumpkinorange
in
color
with
moderate
lacing
and
head
retention
heavy
aromas
of
almond
bread
and
especially
nutmeg
the
flavor
of
nutmeg
continues
lightly
with
the
taste
along
with
a
bite
that
accompanies
the
malty
bitterness
that
grabs
onto
the
tongue
beside
the
spices
this
is
a
good
session
beer
that
i
find
comparable
to
goose
island
harvest
ale
fours
across
the
board

fantastically
drinkable

this
is
just
about
as
close
as
ive
found
to
a
true
american
made
session
beer
i
wish
it
was
just
about
1
cheaper
for
a
six
pack
though
all
in
all
this
is
just
a
genuinely
solid
beer
which
excels
at
not
standing
out
too
much
while
still
being
interesting
taste
is
quite
pleasant
and
balanced
and
even
finishes
with
a
surprising
faint
cherry
aroma
that
while
it
feels
sweet
doesnt
make
the
beer
incredibly
offputting
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
leaves
a
good
coating
on
your
teeth
a
decent
in
bottle
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
d
i
only
have
3
of
these
left
and
i
wish
i
had
a
6
pack
left
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
great
to
session
anytime
of
year
right
now
im
drinking
this
on
a
brisk
october
night
by
a
fire
in
my
backyard
this
is
a
slightly
less
hopped
version
of
the
harvest
ale
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
character
its
a
little
too
light
for
my
taste
i
hadnt
had
an
english
bitter
before
this
but
i
must
say
im
impressed
its
definitely
something
a
person
could
down
quite
a
few
of
especially
with
its
low

this
has
become
my
favorite
session
brew
for
sure
something
i
bring
to
parties
and
find
that
people
pretty
much
always
like
it
pours
a
brawny
golden
color
with
an
average
tan
head
sticky
rings
all
over
the
glass
smell
is
of
dark
breads
with
a
hint
of
herbal
aroma
taste
is
roasted
and
nutty
malt
balanced
with
a
decent
hops
finish
nice
and
balanced
a
workingmans
beer
and
im
a
workingman
good
and
bittertasting
like
a
proper
daily
beverage
i
like
it
pretty
solid
little
beer
here
not
huge
or
emphasized
in
one
way
or
another
but
wellbalanced
tasty
refreshing
definitely
a
repeat
performer
i
could
see
spending
an
evening
with
these
a
great
flagship
i
could
see
this
being
a
session
beer
it
is
well
balanced
low
abv
and
very
tasty
notes
this
is
just
a
strait
up
tasty
ale
with
great
drinkability
aroma
is
fruity
and
orange
citrusy
mild
hop
spice
smells
like
toast
and
jam
actually
taste
is
accordingly
lightly
toasty
and
fruity
with
subtle
hop
spice
and
minerals
a
bit
more
bitter
would
be
nice
in
this
bitter
carbonation
is
nice
and
light
id
like
to
try
this
on
cask
d
easy
drinker
a
nice
mellow
brew
to
relax
with
d
a
solid
brew
anytime
of
year
gi
brews
are
very
good
and
this
is
my
favorite
out
of
the
bottle
as
far
as
the
standards
go
for
them
overall
a
good
beer
im
very
satisfied
ive
been
longing
to
try
this
beer
ive
had
the
goose
island
ipa
summertime
and
their
infamous
bourbon
county
brand
stout
all
of
which
i
was
satisfied
with
goose
island
hasnt
disappointed
me
in
any
way
honkers
ale
off
the
tap
is
remarkable
pours
a
2
head
which
in
minutes
settles
down
to
mere
lace
although
color
appears
to
be
a
hazy
brown
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
you
see
copper
and
orange
smell
and
taste
are
of
classic
malt
with
a
touch
of
both
sweetness
and
bitterness
although
thoroughly
accetable
as
a
beer
i
cant
really
say
it
stands
out
as
unique
frankly
its
just
an
edge
above
average
d
not
a
beer
that
i
could
say
rocked
me
it
has
a
good
aroma
but
lacks
the
complexity
in
the
taste
department
also
the
body
is
rather
thin
it
may
well
be
better
on
draught
d
at
4
2
abv
this
american
esb
offers
a
whole
lotta
character
and
flavor
in
a
relatively
small
package
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
with
spot
on
english
malt
flavors
and
no
overbearing
hop
resins
i
would
certainly
get
it
again
a
very
easy
drinking
mild
beer
i
love
the
citrusy
hops
balanced
off
the
mild
sweetness
and
forward
bitterness
a
very
wellrounded
flavorful
beer
it
doesnt
taste
anything
like
a
pils
however
fuller
bodied
with
pleasantly
fullflavored
caramel
malt
body
not
too
heavy
but
not
too
light
either
this
one
is
definitely
tasty
and
drinkable
d
easy
to
drink
good
for
just
having
one
or
quite
a
few
d
the
alcohol
has
a
bit
of
a
pinch
to
it
with
each
sip
i
certainly
expected
something
a
little
smoother
but
it
wasnt
awful
conclusion
great
americanbrewed
englishstyle
bitter
highly
quaffable
light
and
subtle
but
not
lacking
in
flavor
really
quite
tasty
i
might
think
this
is
worth
a
notch
or
two
higher
maybe
an
a
but
it
doesnt
quite
match
the
complexity
of
some
lowgravity
english
pale
ales
ive
had
like
fresh
black
sheep
special
which
absolutely
blew
me
away
nevertheless
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
one
ill
return
to
frequently
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
simple
slightly
rustic
englishstyle
pub
ale
overall
interesting
beer
from
goose
island
but
its
not
one
that
i
would
personally
rush
to
the
store
to
buy
drinkability
this
is
almost
the
perfect
session
beer
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
full
of
good
flavors
though
i
do
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
note
i
didnt
necessarily
expect
that
so
it
is
okay
definitely
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
for
sessions
parties
or
other
times
when
i
know
id
have
more
than
a
few
possibly
the
best
flavor
out
of
a
beer
of
this
low
an
abv
i
have
tasted
d
a
nice
session
beer
definitely
something
to
drink
with
a
meal
as
well
overall
a
full
flavored
beer
with
a
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
one
great
for
a
session
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
my
fav
breweries
sadly
very
hard
to
get
for
me
in
pa
but
a
small
road
trip
of
2
hrs
and
i
stock
up
on
this
one
drinkability
is
high
very
sessionable
an
exemplary
model
of
the
style
a
pleasant
offering
my
first
experience
with
the
goose
tastes
of
bitter
wheats
with
light
fruit
notes
buried
in
there
it
smells
like
an
orange
grove
its
very
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bubbles
bitters
arent
really
my
things
but
its
as
drinkable
as
other
bitters
a
solid
brew
from
goose
island
that
pours
a
cloudy
glowing
orangeamber
color
theres
a
sweet
malt
nose
backdropped
by
a
yeasty
base

this
opens
up
with

snappy
bitter
sour
tingle
on
the
tongue
before
introducing
you
to
an
evenly
distributed
robust
malt
center
and
residual
dry
finish
heres
something
id
pair
with
a
chicago
style
sausage
or
hotdog
in
the
taste
the
malt
dominates
with
toffee
and
slight
hop
fruitiness
there
is
a
biscuit
like
consistency
and
a
smooth
crispness
d
very
drinkable
not
too
much
alcohol
all
around

do

with

some
tea
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
more
of
the
tea
flavor
comes
out
in
the
mouth
with
a
little
bit
of
biscuit
lingering
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
an
lively
fullbodied
carbonation
easy
drinking
session
beer
not
a
goto
style
for
me
but
this
is
pretty
tasty
true
to
what
an
english
bitter
should
be
this
beer
is
balanced
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
pub
in
boston
pour
a
nice
head
dark
amberbrown
in
color
tasted
more
like
a
red
ale
to
me
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
not
a
stand
out
beer
tastes
smokey
definite
malt
presence
not
too
hoppy
or
bitter
from
what
i
was
getting
from
it
unfortunately
this
review
is
short
because
i
dont
think
the
beer
had
alot
to
describe
pretty
basic
not
bad
but
average
a
decent
example
of
the
style
light
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
fruity
and
citrusy
hops
kind
of
shadows
the
malt
backbone
im
looking
for
here
i
might
consider
this
an
english
ipa
the
way
its
hopped
but
still
a
delicious
beer
though
went
very
well
with
snack
items
like
chips
dip
veggies
i
might
consider
this
for
parties
not
too
assertive
not
too
boring
d
a
delicious
and
light
beer
that
i
could
spend
a
while
drinking
really
like
the
honey
notes
even
if
that
makes
it
a
little
overly
sweet
but
i
think
it
contributes
to
both
the
flavor
and
the
sessionability
for
only
4
2
abv
this
ale
is
very
flavorful
and
does
have
some
complexity
extremely
quaffable
this
is
an
excellent
year
round
ale
english
bitters
have
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
styles
it
is
ashame
that
it
is
a
style
that
can
be
difficult
to
find
this
is
a
very
good
interpretation
md
very
drinkable
and
smooth
creamy
body
enough
carb
to
emphasize
the
hop
bitterness
which
is
pretty
sharp
like
id
expect
from
a
true
version
without
being
at
all
spritzy
or
astringent
very
highly
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
d
very
easy
drinking
cheers
and
happy
birthday
goose
island
d
this
was
never
really
on
my
radar
and
to
be
honest
i
assumed
it
was
a
more
robust
pale
ale
so
i
was
a
bit
surprised
to
find
this
is
a
bitter
very
nice
flavor
and
character
for
the
low
abv
this
would
be
extremely
sessionable
perhaps
not
especially
exciting
but
well
done
overall
impression
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
and
suggest
you
do
the
same
pours
a
nice
opaque
amber
with
a
small
bubbly
and
slightly
foamy
head
aroma
wasnt
too
strong
i
could
pick
up
some
grain
and
hops
though
taste
was
a
mix
of
grain
and
hops
there
were
slight
sweet
malty
tastes
to
it
as
well
good
body
and
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
anytime
but
nothing
special
this
beer
is
a
bit
prickly
on
the
tongue
which
is
in
character
for
the
style
it
is
not
particularly
sweet
and
has
traditional
english
yeast
flavors
there
is
a
saltene
finish
in
the
beer
and
a
herbal
and
grain
husk
courseness
to
the
beer
i
like
it
it
is
rather
light
it
is
refreshing
too
there
is
a
bit
of
lemony
spice
in
this
beer
but
it
culminates
in
that
dry
salty
finish
the
carbonation
is
quite
apparent
and
the
courseness
exacerbates
some
of
the
fizziness
to
the
beer
there
is
a
touch
of
diacetyl
in
this
beer
a
little
touch
of
caramel
malts
too
the
mouth
prickliness
mellows
as
things
settle
in
taste
is
an
excellent
hybrid
feel
of
both
esb
and
a
pale
ale
the
hops
definitely
come
out
when
this
stuff
is
fresh
good
doughbread
feel
in
the
malt
backbone
a
very
full
flavored
session
ale
occasional
consistency
problems
mouthfeel
wise
when
the
beer
can
feel
heavier
good
price
not
exactly
one
of
my
favorites
but
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
d
a
nice
flavour
profile
the
tea
like
quality
is
something
i
have
not
encounted
before
causing
a
slightly
dry
finish
which
contrasts
to
the
juicier
hop
notes
hazelnut
flavours
give
a
nice
malt
sweetness
poured
a
nice
light
copper
color
head
retention
was
very
good
the
aroma
was
slightly
floral
and
spicy
nicely
balanced
with
enough
malt
character
to
go
with
the
initial
bitterness
ends
with
a
smooth
slightly
sweet
finish
some
citrus
notes
very
easy
to
drink
good
session
beer
reviewed
from
notes
two
nights
ago
poured
an
amberbrown
with
a
one
to
two
finger
head
that
has
good
retention
a
good
cloud
and
ring
are
left
behind
on
the
beers
top
leaves
a
fine
coat
of
medium
lacing
the
smell
is
slightly
fruity
hops
and
a
very
wheatbready
malt
aspect
caramel
malts
also
make
an
appearance
in
a
nose
that
is
overall
weak
in
strength
the
taste
is
of
slight
fruity
and
earthy
hops
as
well
as
some
malt
the
hops
seem
like
the
ones
i
have
used
for
my
esb
in
homebrewing
there
is
not
much
hop
bitterness
but
it
is
nice
and
the
style
doesnt
really
call
for
much
misnomer
the
malt
backbone
tastes
wheaty
and
even
corny
malt
is
massive
and
nice
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
style
that
is
not
produced
all
that
much
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
the
moderate
carbonation
suits
the
flavor
no
warmth
from
alcohol
it
is
a
tiny
bit
watery
and
a
coat
of
light
malt
and
fruit
hops
is
left
on
the
tongue
a
good
flavor
and
price
with
no
off
flavors
a
nice
smooth
and
balanced
ale
i
think
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
decent
brew
recommend
a
try
to
others
overall
for
the
sam
adams
crowd
honkers
ale
is
the
lovechild
of
boston
lager
and
boston
ale
in
my
opinion
it
looks
and
smells
like
boston
ale
only
better
it
almost
has
the
maltiness
of
boston
ale
and
the
hoppiness
and
warmth
of
boston
lager
its
definitely
more
bitter
than
both
im
sure
how
easy
this
is
to
find
outside
of
chicago
and
thats
a
shame
on
the
other
hand
goose
island
keeps
its
microbrew
tradition
legitimate
drinkability
easily
drinkable
and
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
is
the
primary
goose
island
offering
available
on
tap
around
the
city
great
for
sessions
with
people
who
enjoy
less
intense
beers
bbqs
etc
all
in
all
a
nice
english
bitter
from
goose
island
i
can
see
why
this
is
the
flagship
ale
this
beer
is
silky
smooth
nice
palate
feeling
to
it
very
refreshing
the
forward
of
the
beer
is
pretty
malty
sweet
and
there
is
some
bitterness
but
not
nearly
enough
to
be
called
a
bitter
i
think
the
drinkability
is
really
high
and
mouthfeel
is
good
its
a
good
beer
but
i
wanted
more
bitter
the
body
is
crisp
with
a
moderate
carbonation
backing
but
still
retains
a
smooth
creamy
feel
great
filling
bready
flavors
nice
bitter
backing
from
a
good
hop
presence
sweet
balance
is
there
but
its
subtle
really
smooth
and
clean
aftertaste
wow
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
little
offering
but
i
love
it
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
locally
with
the
low
abv
i
could
see
this
being
a
regular
sessioner
no
problem
d
a
nice
sessionable
beer
drinks
quite
nicely
d
depending
on
how
pricing
works
out
86pk
is
way
too
much
would
determine
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
i
did
a
clone
and
bumped
my
abv
to
5
75
so
for
that
price
its
a
good
one
mouthfeel
drinkability
medium
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
at
4
2
abv
its
a
nice
session
ale
notes
well
this
is
my
first
offering
from
goose
island
i
must
i
am
happy
a
english
bitter
that
is
very
well
made
cheers
md
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
its
pretty
smooth
rolls
around
the
tongue
very
nice
carbonation
is
medium
low
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
would
get
tired
of
this
stuff
after
2
or
so
as
i
said
if
youre
looking
for
a
bitter
mouth
twisting
disgusting
tasting
beer
youve
found
it
here
this
is
my
first
taste
of
the
english
bitter
style
and
i
sure
will
be
revisiting
honkers
ale
is
enjoyable
on
tap
at
penguin
pizza
in
mission
hill
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
red
color
frothy
white
head
odd
sense
of
creaminess
with
the
first
sip
not
a
noticeable
smell
taste
was
good
malty
at
first
then
a
slight
hint
of
hops
followed
by
a
grapefruit
soursweetness
at
the
end
once
the
beer
warmed
up
a
bit
it
seemed
to
be
a
bit
smoother
in
the
end
i
did
end
up
enjoying
this
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
with
a
low
abv
a
definite
session
beer
it
also
went
well
with
a
pizza
with
spicy
toppings
drinkability
an
above
average
and
dry
english
bitter
one
of
the
better
offerings
i
have
had
from
goose
island
so
far
and
good
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
probably
will
not
pick
up
again
but
if
you
like
the
style
i
would
get
a
six
overall
a
great
session
beer
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
at
the
store
if
i
see
it
drinkability
a
solid
and
sessionable
brew
with
good
flavor
and
not
that
much
alcohol
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
as
the
weather
warms
up
a
little
watery
but
a
nice
flavor
in
the
mouth
very
drinkible
and
smooth
a
great
option
when
you
want
just
a
nice
session
beer
to
relax
with
and
not
have
to
think
too
much
about
the
complexities
of
what
you
are
drinking
this
is
a
brewery
i
have
enjoyed
trying
d
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
multiple
servings
of
my
initial
taste
was
not
favorable
it
seemed
to
have
elements
of
an
adjunct
lager
as
tasting
continues
the
flavor
grows
on
me
theres
a
neutral
hop
bite
in
the
swallow
the
malt
is
a
blend
of
pale
and
light
colored
crystal
i
believe
the
body
is
thin
for
an
english
bitter
drinkability
very
drinkable
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
less
intense
redhook
esb
it
is
a
beer
that
is
very
nice
tasting
and
very
sessionable
not
anything
groundbreaking
but
it
is
solid
and
worthy
of
a
try
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
great
sessionable
quality
im
very
pleased
to
have
sampled
this
brew
and
will
certainly
look
forward
to
additional
partakings
overall
a
very
easydrinking
brew
i
can
see
doing
sixes
of
this
in
the
summer
nothing
really
making
this
one
stand
out
from
the
pack
but
a
nice
soft
change
from
the
extreme
brews
we
jump
into
these
days
worth
the
try
even
if
this
beer
is
right
on
in
some
areas
and
a
bit
lacking
in
others
notes
good
mix
of
english
and
american
flavors
in
an
english
style
solid
everyday
session
type
beer
but
not
going
to
amaze
you
i
really
enjoyed
the
subtleness
in
this
beer
nice
rounded
fruity
flavors
from
the
yeast
with
the
earthy
hops
the
low
carbonation
was
perfect
as
well
lends
to
the
character
of
an
english
bitter
pulled
from
a
cask
my
only
quelm
is
i
would
like
to
have
a
bit
more
malt
character
whether
it
be
more
of
a
toast
or
bready
component
just
needs
a
little
more
all
in
all
a
fine
beer
i
like
it
for
goose
island
on
tap
pours
a
clear
copper
to
orange
with
thin
but
lingering
head
with
good
amount
of
lacing
sweet
smell
of
roasted
caramel
and
floral
hints
fruity
taste
ultimately
decided
closest
to
apricot
and
nutty
crisp
clean
feel
and
easily
drinkable
even
on
a
sunday
would
definitely
drink
it
again
overall
a
very
nice
wellbalanced
brewwould
make
a
great
session
beer
and
a
fine
intro
for
a
craft
beer
newbie
d
pretty
good
all
around
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
i
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
its
an
enjoyable
pint
that
goes
down
easy
the
moderate
dry
finish
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
d
totally
d
a
solid
session
brew
from
goose
island
its
something
ill
consider
having
again
when
im
just
looking
for
a
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
goose
island
honkers
ale
is
a
fairly
decent
beer
i
havent
had
too
many
goose
island
beers
but
ive
been
meaning
to
try
more
honkers
ale
was
similar
to
other
beers
ive
had
other
ales
and
pale
ales
obviously
it
had
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
but
honkers
ale
has
some
great
flavors
i
would
say
that
honkers
is
a
good
goose
island
beer
to
start
with
i
will
definitely
be
trying
some
other
goose
island
beers
in
the
future
drinkability
was
ok
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
that
a
bit
creamy
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
it
pretty
low
in
abv
which
makes
for
a
pretty
tasty
session
beer
heck
of
a
beer
the
6pack
didnt
last
too
long
in
my
fridge
while
this
beer
is
crisp
and
rich
in
flavor
like
a
good
american
pale
ale
it
has
the
low
alcohol
and
balanced
taste
of
a
classic
english
bitter
id
consider
this
a
wellmade
hybrid
of
the
styles
on
one
end
theres
a
tasty
mix
of
barley
grain
dark
bread
and
wholegrain
crackers
while
the
styrian
golding
hops
present
both
earthy
spice
notes
and
fruity
citrus
rind
this
brew
covers
a
lot
of
different
and
complimentary
flavors
all
while
keeping
a
light
drinkable
body
this
is
a
fantastic
session
beer
drinkability
can
you
say
session
beer
d
highly
sessionable
loads
of
flavor
and
character
for
a
beer
with
4
2
abv
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
and
low
abv
my
only
criticism
is
that
i
would
appreciate
a
more
complex
character
if
i
were
to
keep
drinking
these
quality
and
simplicity
make
this
a
very
easy
drinker
this
is
a
great
session
beer
for
warm
weather
or
while
watching
a
ball
game
bring
this
with
you
to
ensure
a
simple
but
good
beer
to
accompany
any
occasion
d
i
could
knock
back
several
of
these
in
a
night
at
low
abv
good
texture
and
flavor
d
a
solid
beer
with
a
flavor
profile
that
surprised
me
very
fruity
indeed
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
d
a
good
beer
overall
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
worth
trying
sometime
a
quick
pour
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
revealed
a
nice
small
head
that
was
gone
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
light
brown
color
its
not
light
enough
to
see
through
it
but
some
light
still
permeates
it
the
smell
matches
the
color
candied
caramel
apples
instantly
come
to
mind
absolutely
beautiful
it
was
heavier
in
my
mouth
then
i
thought
it
would
be
which
cuts
down
a
bit
on
the
drinkability
but
still
good
for
two
or
three
pints
probably
the
flavor
itself
had
such
a
nice
balance
in
taste
what
struck
me
is
that
nothing
really
stood
out
but
instead
of
being
a
detriment
that
was
an
asset
just
an
overall
good
tasting
beer
great
beer
that
i
cant
wait
to
turn
my
friends
on
to
amber
body
one
finger
white
head
slow
dissipation
with
nice
lacing
big
malty
backbone
in
the
nose
some
roastiness
grassy
hops
more
than
citrus
with
some
spice
taste
is
nicely
balanced
between
bready
malts
and
spicy
hops
finish
is
a
bit
bitter
but
not
overly
so
long
lasting
with
good
malt
presence
smooth
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
not
the
most
hop
forward
of
beers
but
very
smooth
d
i
could
always
have
several
of
these
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
spot
on
in
my
opinion
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
billowy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
caramel
malt
sharp
minerals
grass
a
little
mild
citrus
the
taste
is
clean
mineral
tang
roasty
malts
a
little
butterscotch
and
a
sharp
bitter
finish
its
highly
carbonated
fairly
thin
in
body
but
with
a
robust
mouthfeel
nonetheless
its
a
decent
session
beer
perhaps
a
tad
too
bitter
for
anything
but
slow
and
steady
drinking
a
nice
beer
i
think
its
worth
mentioning
that
this
was
about
the
best
of
the
8
or
9
beers
that
lawrys
had
available
its
ridiculous
to
me
that
a
restaurant
with
that
charges
40
for
a
prime
rib
and
has
an
incredible
wine
list
gets
away
offering
this
pilsener
urquell
heinken
and
sam
adams
as
their
nice
beers
libation
the
flavor
profile
is
balanced
but
not
in
a
way
i
thought
would
work
its
less
sweet
and
more
bitter
than
even
an
english
bitter
typically
tastes
but
the
toasty
bready
presence
carries
the
brew
this
is
really
quite
drinkable
and
savory
perfect
for
the
colder
weather
november
in
chicago
i
sampled
this
at
goose
island
clybourn
and
had
to
try
a
full
64
oz
growler
im
glad
i
did
and
im
looking
forward
my
next
session
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
high
carbonation
observable
yet
no
head
formation
aroma
is
mild
with
notes
of
crystal
malt
and
a
bit
of
bread
reminds
me
of
natural
light
flavor
is
light
as
well
with
rice
and
corn
detectable
not
unlike
budweiser
there
is
also
a
sourness
that
lingers
into
the
finish
along
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
body
is
medium
and
smooth
the
most
likable
aspect
of
this
beer
to
me
overall
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
maybe
refreshing
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
not
very
enticing
d
i
know
that
this
is
rather
drinkable
beer
from
a
recent
trip
to
chicago
i
had
to
bring
some
home
with
me
d
medium
great
beer
in
moderation
d
very
good
this
is
a
hell
of
a
session
beer
d
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
the
fizz
makes
you
feel
full
after
a
while
dtasty
beer
nothing
special
but
gets
the
job
done
very
well
notes
this
review
comes
with
very
little
experience
with
english
bitters
bitterness
aint
exactly
my
cup
of
meat
but
this
beer
was
still
smooth
and
pleasant
ive
noticed
that
i
view
other
beers
from
goose
island
similar
to
my
interpretation
of
this
one
they
are
usally
solid
examples
of
the
style
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
ive
been
meaning
to
try
one
of
their
limtiedbatch
offerings
such
as
bourbon
county
stout
matilda
or
pere
jacques
to
see
if
they
can
push
past
mediocrity
to
excellence
mothfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
has
medium
carbonation
its
hard
to
get
excited
about
this
beer
it
is
wet
and
does
quench
a
thirst
poured
into
a
pint
glass
12
white
head
leaves
about
a
line
of
lacing
smells
like
oranges
and
maybe
apricots
definitely
oranges
taste
is
mildly
citrusy
and
somewhat
bitterspicy
not
overly
malty
or
hoppy
the
hop
presence
is
there
but
not
over
bearing
a
little
bit
of
a
malt
undertone
good
carbonation
an
excellent
standard
if
i
could
i
would
have
this
on
hand
all
the
time
with
sam
adams
lager
fat
tire
amber
and
anything
from
3floyds
i
dont
see
how
anyone
could
not
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
a
hell
of
a
session
beer
a
good
crisp
mouth
feel
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
with
a
abv
of

2
you
can
go
through
a
sixer
pretty
fast
this
is
my
second
goose
island
brew
and
i
have
to
say
i
am
impressed
with
it
as
i
cubs
fan
cant
wait
to
hit
up
the
goose
island
wrigleyville
establishment
d
good
drinkable
but
not
a
favorite
a
good
back
up
beer
that
many
different
palates
will
find
enjoyable
a
beer
for
when
i
need
to
grab
something
but
am
out
of
better
options
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
bitter
that
surprised
the
hell
out
of
me
this
just
might
be
my
favorite
out
of
the
year
around
releases
from
goose
island
drinkability
solid
brew
not
gis
best
offering
but
still
a
solid
brew
and
nice
to
have
around
had
this
at
ziggys
bar
located
in
amherst
ohio
pouured
from
tap
into
beer
glass
about
12
inch
of
head
pleasantly
suprised
with
the
flovor
very
solid
taste
with
excellent
drinkability
smell
was
about
average
nothing
special
and
same
with
apperance
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
pours
a
darkish
amber
with
a
good
sized
white
head
that
recedes
into
a
thin
film
of
bubbles
covering
the
surface
of
the
beer
leaves
some
lacing
smell
is
lightly
hopped
with
classic
goldings
bitterness
and
a
spicy
herbal
note
underlaid
with
a
solid
malt
structure
of
sweet
caramel
and
toast
mild
fruitiness
grapefruit
and
apple
taste
is
not
as
strong
much
of
the
hop
bitterness
getting
lost
and
a
watery
component
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
still
good
reasonable
body
and
a
good
level
of
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
good
but
not
exceptional
for
the
style
not
a
bad
effort
but
not
a
great
one
either
hv
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
and
definitely
a
good
session
beer
if
this
ever
makes
its
way
to
my
part
of
north
carolina
ill
definitely
pick
up
a
sixer
taste
is
smooth
and
satisfying
blend
of
malts
and
noble
varity
hops
exceptionally
balanced
and
quaffable
honkers
leaves
a
little
lacing
as
the
beer
goes
down
it
has
a
light
bodied
feel
and
leaves
very
sharp
as
a
bitter
its
not
meant
to
be
refreshing
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
pub
standard
brew
pretty
basic
overall
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
this
one
but
nothing
fancy
either
a
solid
drinkable
beer
nice
easy
drinking
brew
i
like
it
goose
island
honkers
ale
is
a
clear
solid
amber
ale
with
a
soft
creamy
off
white
whipped
fluff
of
a
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
fruity
wooden
botanical
and
dank
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
its
medium
bodied
smooth
and
fluffy
and
the
finish
is
a
little
gritty
its
not
sweet
or
dry
with
nice
balance
all
around
there
are
flavor
notes
of
wood
resin
wild
flowers
and
a
green
bitterness
this
makes
for
a
high
quality
session
ale
drinkability
very
good
session
style
beer
drinks
real
easy
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
that
wont
leave
you
with
a
hop
mouth
or
tired
of
drinking
malty
brew
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
i
had
this
a
couple
years
ago
and
remember
it
being
really
bitter
and
not
enjoying
it
at
all
i
had
avoided
it
for
so
long
as
a
result
and
i
wish
i
hadnt
i
think
this
is
gonna
be
a
beer
that
i
come
back
to
with
some
regularity
my
how
the
times
change
a
beer
i
used
to
drink
in
college
and
now
just
became
available
in
ny
i
remember
it
being
pretty
good
but
then
again
compared
to
keystone
anything
tastes
good
anyways
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
copper
color
with
1
finger
of
head
that
faded
to
a
ring
of
foam
it
has
a
nice
bready
malty
aroma
taste
starts
out
very
crisp
with
some
bitterness
and
then
fades
quickly
with
some
lingering
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
finish
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
overall
it
has
good
drinkability
final
thoughts
a
pretty
good
american
take
on
an
english
bitter
pub
style
beer
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
lots
of
toasted
malt
aromas
and
taste
some
bittering
uk
hops
slight
fruitish
flavors
i
could
easily
pound
down
a
few
of
these
at
a
bar
drinkability
havent
tried
too
many
beers
of
this
style
seems
like
a
nice
balance
if
a
bit
subdued
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
would
make
a
pretty
good
session
beer
d
i
think
this
is
a
solid
beer
goose
island
makes
great
beers
in
full
disclosure
i
no
longer
enjoy
english
bitters
they
just
taste
too
generic
maybe
its
because
i
drank
so
much
of
them
in
the
uk
growing
up
i
have
nothing
against
beers
that
arent
big
but
this
beer
does
absolutely
nothing
for
me
and
i
routinely
avoid
it
on
tap
even
though
it
is
often
one
of
the
few
craft
beers
available
in
macro
bars
my
wife
really
likes
it
so
maybe
it
is
just
me
poured
a
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
aroma
is
wonderfully
doughy
and
bread
like
with
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
flavor
is
of
grain
and
toasted
malt
awesomeness
this
is
a
perfectly
balanced
bitter
the
caramel
malt
flavor
is
fairly
sweet
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
a
good
amount
of
tingly
from
the
carbonation
this
is
an
awesome
session
beer
i
could
drink
it
forever
d
very
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
a
few
of
these
down
d
very
drinkable
over
and
over
a
solid
choice
a
pleasure
indeed
perhaps
its
the
style
or
the
fact
that
weve
been
waiting
awhile
in
this
part
of
the
country
to
get
goose
island
products
but
this
was
a
treat
gorgeous
hazy
amber
to
orange
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
tan
head
subtle
carbonation
that
raised
a
very
nicely
balanced
malt
scent
to
the
nose
flavor
was
equally
balanced
with
a
soft
biscuity
flavor
that
melds
into
a
very
subtle
hops
bitterness
for
a
crisp
dry
finish
and
the
flavor
excelled
as
it
warmed
very
drinkable
notes
my
first
english
bitter
and
a
good
one
at
that
i
enjoy
the
hop
flavor
without
being
overwhelmed
by
it
like
some
beers
a
beer
i
could
see
myself
going
back
to
cloudy
amber
in
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
hung
in
there
for
a
while
i
didnt
get
much
of
an
aroma
maybe
a
little
of
the
grass
that
the
reviewer
before
me
mentioned
the
taste
baffled
me
a
little
malt
at
the
start
a
little
hops
at
the
end
but
i
liked
it
so
ill
just
have
to
resort
to
well
balanced
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
so
maybe
ill
be
able
to
pick
out
that
elusive
flavor
im
missing
feel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
was
there
though
not
excessively
absolutely
on
the
drinkability
d
um
yes
living
in
chicago
i
have
the
chance
to
taste
this
often
and
i
am
always
amazed
at
how
the
tastes
change
each
time
even
when
pouring
from
a
bottle
i
usually
leave
a
little
behind
when
pouring
into
a
glass
to
taste
the
bottle
flavor
when
i
do
i
taste
an
amzing
hop
presence
a
sharp
bitterness
that
i
dont
pick
up
anywhere
else
relaible
and
delicious
as
always
d
again
the
comfortable
mouthfeel
and
light
balanced
taste
make
it
very
sessionable
and
drinkable
d
an
extremely
approachable
hoppy
brew
for
the
masses
well
done
if
i
lived
in
the
chicago
area
this
would
definitely
be
my
safe
option
as
its
available
everywhere
and
its
quite
good
if
youre
in
the
chicago
area
dont
be
afraid
of
the
mass
distribution
this
is
a
great
brew
and
you
should
try
it
d
to
me
this
is
more
of
an
apa
than
a
bitter
because
of
the
grapefruit
flavors
overall
it
goes
down
easy
and
seems
an
excellent
session
brew
given
my
recent
second
experience
with
another
beer
that
had
vastly
improved
perhaps
i
will
throw
this
into
a
mixed
six
in
the
near
future
and
consider
an
edit
to
this
review
if
i
am
proved
wrong
otherwise
i
really
dont
know
what
all
the
hype
is
about
and
this
would
be
another
beer
of
about
a
dozen
where
i
am
way
below
the
ba
composite
poured
into
pint
glass
appears
a
light
copper
color
with
a
creamy
medium
head
aroma
of
some
citrus
and
a
grains
starts
off
sweet
with
taste
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
hops
kick
in
after
that
with
some
spiciness
to
the
taste
it
ends
wtih
the
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
what
a
great
beer
another
good
one
from
great
lakes
great
session
beer
too
d
a
good
ale
good
balance
malt
and
hops
im
not
a
fan
of
the
taste
of
this
beer
come
worse
is
that
it
leaves
a
lingering
dry
finish
on
the
palate
and
mouth
that
im
not
fond
of
worst
of
all
it
gave
me
a
damn
headache
its
smooth
and
tastes
very
good
especially
when
its
warm
outside
drinkability
very
nice
drinkability
and
one
of
the
better
american
made
craft
beers
of
the
style
i
like
surlys
bitter
brewer
best
but
this
is
a
close
second
served
in
a
standard
pint
amberbrown
body
with
a
medium
tan
head
smell
is
of
toasted
grain
taste
is
biscuity
a
hint
of
caramel
and
fresh
bread
nice
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
and
a
nice
bitterness
that
balances
out
the
malt
flavor
super
tasty
mouthfeel
is
good
cabonation
levels
slightly
high
for
the
style
drinkability
is
fantastic
an
excellent
session
ale
it
is
quite
spot
on
for
the
english
bitter
style
except
for
it
doesnt
have
the
yeast
flavors
imparted
by
a
british
strain
still
a
great
interpretation
that
i
wish
i
could
get
in
oklahoma
overall
a
respectable
brew
that
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
wouldnt
reccommend
it
unless
you
are
seriously
into
over
hopped
beers
the
honkers
ale
is
actually
more
bitter
and
hoppy
than
their
ipa
notes
this
seems
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
an
english
bitter
american
bitter
maybe
very
easy
to
drink
easy
to
session
i
was
a
big
fan
of
this
from
start
to
finish
but
it
didnt
wow
my
anywhere
a
fresh
interpretation
of
the
style
4
5
d
this
is
a
very
sessionable
ale
the
taste
is
damn
good
and
never
got
boring
drinks
pretty
well
the
body
goes
down
very
well
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
honkers
appears
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
of
fluffy
off
white
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
floral
hops
medium
toasted
bread
and
grain
nicely
caramelized
malt
slightly
nutty
crisp
and
clean
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
levels
for
a
bitter
worth
a
try
if
you
spot
it
its
a
bit
heavy
and
probably
not
a
beer
id
want
to
make
an
evening
out
of
ive
got
a
feeling
this
would
be
very
good
with
food
though
it
definitely
has
the
body
to
stand
up
to
some
spice
all
in
all
absolutely
nothing
speaks
against
this
beer
but
it
also
doesnt
have
anything
to
put
it
on
my
alist
pretty
looking
beer
with
an
above
par
scent
the
label
says
a
perfect
blend
of
hops
and
malt
and
if
you
like
your
malt
a
little
more
than
you
hops
than
it
is
probably
close
to
perfect
the
malt
did
overshadow
the
hops
by
quite
a
bit
but
the
result
was
still
an
excellent
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
rich
drinkability
was
great
drinkability
personally
if
this
was
less
carbonated
it
would
make
it
even
nicer
this
beer
is
not
as
hoppy
as
the
bottle
label
leads
you
to
believe
it
is
a
nice
drinkable
brew
but
lacks
strong
character
to
set
it
apart
it
is
quite
pretty
in
the
glass
having
a
nice
orangish
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
the
nose
is
mild
and
the
palate
is
rather
plain
boasting
a
bit
of
soft
malt
that
is
well
rounded
by
the
smooth
but
slightly
light
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
nondescript
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
hops
nice
thirst
quencher
d
i
can
drink
this
one
all
night
and
have
on
several
occasions
well
done
and
a
great
flagship
beer
from
this
local
brewery
d
easily
drinkable
a
good
solid
beer
this
is
readily
available
in
my
area
and
a
good
alternative
when
there
are
few
micro
choices

until
the
next
drink
good
beer
very
sessionable
drinkability
this
is
a
good
english
bitterstyle
ale
that
is
quite
easy
drinking
the
abv
on
this
beer
may
only
be
around
4
but
it
is
such
a
high
quality
product
with
beauty
throughout
that
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
beer
novice
or
beer
aficiando
for
a
sublime
taste
of
a
sessionable
ale
made
with
love
and
character
this
may
not
be
the
one
for
the
hop
heads
out
there
nor
for
the
givemeastrongeffingbeernow
crowd
rather
it
is
for
the
folks
who
appreciate
the
subtleties
in
their
beer
oh
and
you
can
drink
several
pints
of
these
in
the
pub
without
falling
down
d
overall
not
quite
what
i
expected
the
malt
is
certaintly
present
but
it
lacks
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
for
my
palate
easily
sessioned
overall
not
great
but
not
hateful
either
as
its
been
noted
by
other
reviewers
malt
sweetness
is
pretty
minimal
in
this
brew
and
the
hop
profile
puts
it
on
the
bitter
side
of
average
that
being
its
only
defect
its
still
a
solid
session
beer
a
good

youre

with

enough

maltiness

creamy

it
was
the
best
offering
of
the
night
at
a

and
enjoyed
it
much
more
than
all
the
bud
products
that
were
offered
including

finishes
mildly

imo
a

quite

a
great
session
beer
with
a

drinkability
session
i
would
if
i
could
but
i
have
to
get
this
from
chicago
friends
this
has
summertime
all
over
it
deffinetly
a
good
one
by
the
goose
island
brewery
almost
perfect
for
its
style
will
definetly
be
drinking
more
of
these
easy
drinking

a

with

brownish
light
amber
with
small

palate
of
light

german
stale

and
a
mild
smokey
leather
and
a
mild
bitter
this
beer
has
a
nice
breadiness
light
body
and
very
mild
easy
drinking
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
on
tap
at
the
torches
on
the
hudson
restaurant
in
newburgh
ny
and
at
first
look
and
smell
i
was
expecting
big
things
it
had
an
ambercopper
hue
with
a
very
purposeful
sized
white
head
and
globby
lacing
a
plenty
the
aroma
suggested
a
full
bodied
brew
with
some
malt
character
and
citrus
and
brown
bread
however
i
was
disappointed
in
tasting
it
to
find
a
surprisingly
watery
citrusgrass
hop
concoction
lost
in
a
somewhat
sweet
but
wishywashy
malt
it
just
seemed
odd
that
the
same
beer
that
looked
and
smelled
good
would
taste
so
whimpy
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
i
could
see
the
connection
as
a
bitter
but
it
was
not
something
i
would
buy
again
based
upon
this
sample
worthy
of
a
try
if
you
like
a
thin
bitter
that
is
easy
drinking
i
pick
up
a
bit
of
grass
on
this
that
just
is
not
my
favorite
flavor
for
any
style
brew
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
another
sessionable
beer
from
gi
however
this
isnt
anything
too
special
about
it
not
saying
thats
a
bad
thing
this
is
a
near
perfect
english
style
bitter
for
me
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
hop
side
but
it
seems
to
have
a
little
bit
of
everything
and
the
hops
might
even
keep
the
interest
of
a
hop
head
for
a
brew
or
two
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
tap
d
smooth
and
could
go
through
several
probably
a
good
session
for
the
style
personal
drinkabilty
would
be
a
little
lower
as
i
didnt
find
anything
incredible
about
it
d
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
i
wish
i
could
get
this
brew
in
dfw
unfortunately
had
to
drink
to
pick
on
road
trip
to
arkansas
hopefully
someday
it
will
be
available
in

drinkability
a
decent
drinkable
beer
not
overpowering
at
all
somewhat
above
average
mouth
is
crisp
and
a
litle
overcarbonated
but
is
necessary
for
the
bitterness
drinkability
is
high
and
is
refreshing
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
two

offwhite
head
aroma
of
spicy
hops
and
a
nice
sweet
toasted
malt
flavor
starts
slightly
sweet
and
turns
to
spicypiny
hops
with
a
mild
bitterness
a
very
clean
and
fresh
mouthfeel
and
finish
light
body
light
carbonation
a
very
nice
session
beer
d
its
definitely
a
tasty
beverage
there
are
a
few
stylistic
flaws
carbonation
too
high
sweet
finish
haze
this
was
certainly
the
standout
choice
amongst
the
others
available
looks
nice
in
the
glass
amber
with
a
tight
2
finger
head
faint
aroma
of
fruit
and
maltiness
a
nice
and
well
balanced
ale
goes
down
real
easy
smooth
and
tasty
without
feeling
heavy
good
stuff
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
several
in
a
session
this
is
a
beer
that
i
can
see
myself
keeping
on
hand
most
of
the
time
d
highly
drinkable
with
a
nice
taste
taste
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
smokywoody
flavor
that
finishes
off
with
a
tart
citrus
and
bitter
flavor
that
doesnt
stay
too
long
very
unique
with
the
initial
flavor
but
a
very
good
taste
d
very
drinkable
good
solid
session
beer
a
winner
in
my
book
wow
this
may
be
one
of
the
ultimate
session
beers
so
smooth
and
chugable
i
dont
find
it
to
be
all
that
bitter
but
it
does
have
great
grassy
hop
flavor
malts
are
there
but
they
are
so
soft
and
silky
the
beer
just
glides
down
the
throat
this
would
be
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
if
it
was
available
in
tejas
future
outlook
this
is
a
very
nice
quality
tame
beer
imo
that
would
well
serve
a
wide
scope
of
drinking
purposes
and
also
hit
a
nice
broad
audience
not
a
knock

had

neither

not
a

beer

i

that
there
have
to

better
examples
of
ordinary

out
there

this
beer
gets
the
job
done
well
enough
too
a
session
beer
for
sure
theres
some
controversy
over
the
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
some
sources
say
5
percent
others
say
4
3
percent
alcohol
i
believe
the
4
3
percent
not
too
watery
or
creamy
overall
and
light
to
medium
bodied
sweet
its
a
great
session
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
of
this
one
and
the
flavor
profile
is
grounded
in
woodiness
from
the
casks
i
imagine
this
brew
is
conditioned
in
of
course
plus
some
breadyness
the
hops
are
more
balanced
here
malty
flavour
up
front
makes
way
for
a

bite
at
the

its

one
of
the
few
u
s
examples
of
a
proper
bitter
that
i
have
encountered
the
best
is
from
oliver
brewery
at
the
pratt
street
ale
house
in
baltimore
well
balanced
and
served
cask
conditioned
as
all
bitters
should
be
this
was
a
surprising
treat
overall
a
very
good
english
bitter
great
citrus
presence
for
an
easy
drinking
session
ale
on
cask
at
town
hall
brewery
this
beer
arrives
a
clear
orangeamber
color
the
head
is
a
solid
inch
of
foam
that
lasts
until
the
beer
is
gone
and
leaves
thick
rings
of
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
lemons
limes
oranges
and
herbal
hops
the
taste
has
a
strong
grapefruit
character
but
there
is
also
an
ample
amount
of
passion
fruit
lemon
lime
and
orange
there
is
also
a
firm
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
is
a
really
complex
taste
and
i
seem
to
find
something
new
with
each
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
appropriately
low
carbonation
and
a
silky
texture
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
verges
on
greatness
i
am
really
kicking
myself
that
it
took
me
seven
years
of
patronizing
town
hall
before
i
tried
it
i
will
certainly
not
be
waiting
seven
more
years
before
i
drink
it
again
o
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
and
have
always
forgotten
to
tick
it
this
beer
i
feel
is
over
looked
because
of
all
the
other
great
beers
town
hall
brews
this
beer
is
solid
and
very
enjoyable
the
west
bank
was
also
available
on
cask
condition
during
our
visit
to
the
town
hall
this
gave
a
nice
chance
to
try
the
cask
vs
standard
pour
the
cask
condition
carried
the
same
color
nice
copper
as
the
tap
version
however
there
was
no
carbonation
and
the
head
was
thicker
and
more
frothy
the
smell
was
also
the
same
as
my
previous
review
however
the
taste
was
much
more
bitter
making
it
more
tough
on
the
pallet
still
a
decent
beer
but
i
prefer
it
on
tap
a
surprisingly
flavorful
pale
its
a
bit
weak
on
the
finish
but
a
good
display
of
simcoe
hops
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wasnt
that
crazy
about
it
the
cask
style
seemed
to
be
the
better
option
here
o
solid
beer
should
be
easier
to
drink
with
the
low
abv
but
not
a
ton
of
complaints

this

there
are

that
pop

the
sniff
and
the
sip
but
not
as
much
as
some
stock
ales
the
finish
to
this
beer
has
a
nice
malty
sensation
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
and
when
i
bring
new
friends
to
the
town
hall
brewery
and
they
are
looking
for
a
recommendation
i
will
usually
pull
this
one
for
them
one
friend
i
visit
with
regularly
loves
this
stuff
and
almost
never
drinks
anything
else
i
like
other
offerings
better
but
its
better
than
lots
of
beers
on
the
market
i
have
come
to
realize
that
it
resembles
a
similar
tap
water
quality
of
the
minneapolis
area
i
think
this
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
d
solid
beer
throughout
and
quite
drinkable
i
probably
would
opt
for
others
though
in
the
future
d
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
maybe
it
was
offat
least
the
bitterness
and
my
drinking
buddy
agreed
it
was
presented
to
us
as
a
mild
red
that
was
the
colour
lace
suggested
freshness
it
had
some
head
too
served
cold
but
a
tad
of
mould
in
there
and
an
offbitterness
i
could
drink
some
of
it
but
a
surprisingly
weak
one
d
good
brew
certainly
could
be
a
great
session
beer
this
beer
is
much
better
than
it
used
to
be
since
hoops
has
tweaked
the
recipe
nicely
toasty
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
and
creamy
mouthfeel
but
drink
this
first
because
for
some
reason
it
doesnt
go
well
with
the
ipa
unless
you
drink
the
pub
first
so
when
you
head
over
to
the
town
hall
for
pint
club
or
pickapint
hour
grab
a
pub
ale
first
before
drowning
yourself
in
ipa
something
went
wrong
here
for
me
maybe
my
palate
was
compromised
by
drinking
a
pint
of
the
1800
ipa
before
this
the
barkeep
also
said
they
just
changed
the
barrel
or
whatever
they
use
to
serve
the
beer
so
maybe
it
was
a
fouled
batch
the
taste
was
dirty
musty
and
almost
skunky
the
appearance
was
good
for
some
reason
i
cant
really
get
a
smell
of
the
beers
while
im
sitting
at
the
bar
besides
the
smell
of
detergent
off
the
glassware
but
nothing
alerted
me
that
there
might
be
something
wrong
when
i
go
back
i
will
definately
give
it
another
go
because
i
am
sure
it
was
just
a
combination
of
things
that
led
me
to
have
a
negative
response
to
this
beer
dusty
copper
colored
body
topped
by
an
offwhite
head
aromas
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
woody
hops
the
flavor
has
great
malt
character
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
the
earthiness
of
the
malting
floor
seems
to
come
through
with
this
beer
not
sure
if
the
yeast
is
unique
to
this
offering
but
the
yeast
character
seems
to
come
through
mouthfeel
smooth
and
solid
the
drinkability
is
better
than
the
sum
of
the
individual
parts
although
not
impressive
in
any
other
individual
way
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
as
a
side
note
on
cask
or
on
nitro
this
beer
is
extreeeemly
smooth
tops
mouthfeel
for
sure
on
grolwer
though
much
is
lost
a
shame
oh
well

this
is
a
pale
ale
now
with
simcoe
hops
its
an
even
better
session
beer
with
a
great
citrus
fruity
and
perfumey
hops
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
this
pours
a
pale
golden
amber
color
with
a
quarterinch
whitish
head
and
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
there
is
a
minimal
smell
of
malt
the
taste
is
mildly
malty
and
grassy
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
this
feels
pleasingly
light
on
the
tongue
a
nice
undemanding
easy
drinker
in
all
this
is
a
beer
i
could
see
drinking
several
of
in
an
evening
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
i
could
see
drinking
enough
of
these
to
need
a
cab
or
bus
ride
home
last
swigs
mild
ale
overall
barely
bitter
almond
ginger
this
beer
came
a
bright
honey
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
left
awesome
lace
smells
of
yeasty
malt
with
a
very
slight
bitterness
tastes
of
delicate
bitterness
and
of
a
buttery
brown
ale
with
some
decisive
grassiness
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
a
very
light
carbonation
amber
in
colour
with
low
carbonation
definitely
a
milder
type
of
bitter
in
keeping
with
the
english
style
session
bitters
slightly
spicy
hop
aroma
a
light
but
pleasing
malt
vs
bitter
balance
good
drinkability
but
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
for
me
i
thought
it
also
lacked
a
bit
of
the
complexity
of
some
of
the
other
bitters
that
ive
had
generally
solid
but
i
like
their
other
products
better
dark
gold
almost
amber
color
slightly
chillhaze
on
the
pint
nice
head
close
to
12
an
inch
in
height
and
leaving
very
attractive
lace
hops
mark
the
aroma
more
than
i
anticipated
almost
weedy
in
springtime
fashion
perhaps
indicative
of
some
american
influence
smooth
and
quaffable
better
mouthfeel
than
some
in
its
consistent
quality
with
a
wellbalanced
approach
to
flavor
profile
lightly
diacetyl
with
buttery
tones
and
an
interesting
combination
of
licoricelike
hoppiness
and
chocolate
and
toffee
candy
lighlty
sweet
aftertaste
marks
an
overall
pleasant
experience
more
substance
than
many
brewpub
bitters
without
a
marked
alcohol
hike
west
bank
didnt
rock
my
world
but
this
was
actually
my
fifth
pint
of
the
evening
and
its
possible
i
was
at
the
threshold
of
palate
fatigue
east
bank
thanks
to
bighuge
for
sharing
this
one
like
all
town
hall
beers
goes
fast
very
clear
golden
color
nice
white
head
fresh
nose
but
soft
nice
light
maltiness
with
a
fresh
floral
hoppiness
on
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
this
style
session
beer
all
the
way
easy
drinking
nice
fresh
floral
taste
nice
easy
drinking
beer
certainly
not
a
big
beer
seems
more
of
a
mild
to
me
in
substance
but
has
a
bit
more
hops
than
youd
expect
i
guess
a
basic
bitter
is
about
right
certainly
not
an
esb
by
any
means
good
brew
for
the
style
id
select
many
of
their
others
over
this
because
id
prefer
something
more
substantial
but
thats
just
me
like
i
said
for
the
style
this
is
good
this
was
a
beer
that
i
didnt
wuite
figure
out
the
style
on
it
i
assumed
it
was
another
pale
ale
when
i
tried
it
but
there
was
a
difference
there
was
a
sudle
spiciness
that
was
hard
to
trace
throught
the
sample
i
like
the
hops
finish
this
beer
is
definitely
one
id
get
again
kind
of
a
dull
copper
appearance
very
slight
haze
a
good
sized
ivory
white
head
sits
on
top
and
has
great
retention
the
lace
left
by
it
is
full
intricate
and
droopy
aroma
is
herbal
and
grassy
oily
and
hoppy
and
toffeelike
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
from
cask
this
beer
is
like
velvet
body
is
pushing
medium
flavor
profile
seems
to
be
very
english
which
is
no
surprise
im
guessing
english
hops
here
but
i
could
be
wrong
they
are
earthy
and
grassy
bitterness
is
clean
and
noticeable
enjoyable
malt
profile
seems
caramel
derived
toffee
tones
are
quite
enjoyable
really
good
this
one
is
quite
quaffable
smell
is
solid
display
of
balance
with
a
nice
fresh
bread
toned
malt
thats
a
bit
roasty
and
the
hops
lend
a
nice
bouquet
of
light
pine
and
citrus
taste
is
well
balanced
starting
with
lightly
toasted
bread
that
keeps
its
share
of
the
taste
up
til
it
starts
with
the
hops
which
is
just
past
midway
and
goes
from
there
with
some
pretty
favorable
amounts
of
bittering
hops
fresh
and
herbally
grassy
with
sour
pineyness
and
light
puckering
grapefruit
rinds
great
lingering
bitterness
quality
that
also
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
highly
roasted
nuts
and
more
bread
malts
and
yeast
playing
in
with
the
bitterness
quite
a
nice
attachment
feel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
mellow
the
whole
way
through
and
the
bitterness
gives
a
little
extra
zip
quite
a
nice
little
bitter
brew
refreshing
and
drinkable
goes
good
with
any
of
the
appetizers
this
visit
the
wb
pub
was
also
available
on
cask
and
in
that
form
id
have
to
add
an
extra
star
the
head
was
thick
and
creamy
the
flavor
was
mellow
but
made
a
powerful
presence
on
the
palate
and
it
went
down
like
a
dream
ah
bliss
big
miss
surly
sorry
surly
doom
tree
3
55
seems
a
bit
dark
and
heavy
for
an
english
bitter
like
a
souped
up
version
much
more
malt
driven
than
i
expected
we
dont
get
enough
good
english
styles
anymore
so
this
is
rad
also
no
surly
still
in
colorado
so
thanks
to
my
man
in
omaha
for
sending
this
one
my
way
an
esb
grain
base
hopped
like
an
american
ipa
thats
what
this
is
to
me
i
get
the
maris
otter
malt
and
the
crystal
60
range
stuff
and
i
do
get
a
cool
english
yeast
profile
thats
less
doughy
and
bready
and
more
fresh
baked
not
so
raw
amber
ale
seemingly
in
its
base
too
with
some
caramelized
sugar
going
on
hops
are
enormous
in
nose
and
taste
pine
family
more
woody
even
than
needles
or
sap
and
for
me
that
screams
centennial
although
i
am
not
sure
what
varietals
are
used
here
i
think
its
cool
they
collaborated
with
a
band
on
this
one
and
i
think
its
neat
that
they
did
so
much
with
a
traditional
european
style
surly
is
one
of
those
breweries
i
go
back
and
forth
on
like
is
it
local
hype
or
is
it
really
all
that
good
this
one
pushes
me
back
into
the
yeah
fair
enough
its
awesome
side
of
the
debate
but
it
wages
on
wonderful
carbonation
and
dry
enough
in
the
finish
for
nothing
but
the
intense
hops
to
linger
well
made
and
clever
brew
thanks
again
to
my
buddy
in
nebraska
for
sharing
this
one
low
enough
abv
to
romp
on
as
well
i
could
drink
eight
of
these
without
question
very
weird
taste
even
for
an
english
bitter
it
was
also
kind
of
syrupy
i
wasnt
a
fan
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
the
style
but
i
find
that
what
i
want
from
my
bitters
are
to
be
very
drinkable
with
just
enough
complexity
and
balance
of
tropical
fruit
and
tea
presence
needless
to
say
this
beer
really
delivers
and
surly
continues
to
put
out
phenomenally
brewed
session
ales
doomtree
pours
a
clear
hazel
color
with
a
small
but
lacing
head
there
is
a
spicy
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
bold
lots
of
malt
comes
out
with
hints
of
hop
and
lots
of
spices
good
body
good
feel
overall
its
a
very
bold
english
bitter
moving
on
to
my
first
viewing
of
the
room
oh
hai
surly
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
robyamber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
dominated
by
straight
pine
mildly
earthy
greens
and
a
touch
of
grapefruit
rind
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
pine
underlined
by
a
vein
of
resin
that
rounds
things
out
rather
nicely
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
straightforward
hop
farm
of
a
beer
im
digging
it
fgood
body
a
little
more
carbonated
than
id
expect
from
a
bitter
but
leaves
a
nice
mouth
feel
have
you
ever
put
your
nose
into
a
dime
bag
and
inhaled
deeply
that
wonderful
sensational
is
how
this
beer
tastes
dank
earthy
a
little
bit
naughty
this
beer
is
an
example
of
what
surly
does
best
takes
a
classic
style
and
tweaks
it
ever
so
slightly
so
you
can
still
recognize
it
but
its
juiced
up
in
a
surprising
and
mindexpanding
way
highly
recommend
i
think
this
just
isnt
my
style
hoppy
and
delicious
bitter
word
looks
like
a
brown
ale
dark
saison
lots
of
spicy
bubblegum
yeast
tasted
from
a
1

othis
beer
brings
together
the
qualities
of
several
styles
of
beer
in
a
very
enjoyable
manner
its
most
like
an
english
bitter
but
brings
in
some
definite
saison
and
hoppiness
that
are
unusual
not
what
i
expected
from
surly
i
expected
the
flavors
to
be
stronger
i
thought
it
was
just
toasty
and
bitter
enough
good
beer
overly
toasted
and
bitter
but
not
in
an
enjoyable
way
different
is
cool
but
its
not
very
good
here
much
like
minneapolis
hiphop
i
suppose
for
a
non
sought
after
beer
this
is
really
solid
drinking
straight
out
of
the
can
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
hoppedup
version
slightly
spicy
version
of
spotted
cow
out
of
glass
the
subtlety
disappears
and
it
leans
towards
almost
towards
christmas
beer
i
will
drink
the
rest
out
of
the
can
at
cellar
temp
sweet
with
medium
carbonation
somewhat
dry
finish
with
fruit
candy
fun
and
interesting
this
yeast
may
be
too
much
for
some
but
with
this
recipe
it
is
working
well
overall
picked
up
a
4
pack
of
surlys
latest
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
bitter
to
me
seems
more
on
the
belgian
pale
or
belgian
ipa
side
lots
and
lots
of
bubblegum
flavor
which
i
enjoyed
i
havent
really
tasted
bubblegum
in
beer
for
quite
a
while
for
some
reason
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
aroma
is
fruit
sugarcandy
and
light
bananasbubblegum
the
flavor
is
fruit
sugarcandy
light
hops
bananasbubblegum
malts
and
a
mix
of
mild
sweetness
and
slight
warmingheat
in
the
finish
another
brilliant
brew
from
surly
clasic
surly
hop
bite
but
with
plenty
of
balance
not
malty
but
other
things
are
here
to
calm
the
beast
while
it
is
technically
an
english
bitter
it
is
more
like
they
took
the
best
parts
of
a
bitter
and
and
american
pale
ale
and
smashed
them
together
i
think
this
is
a
great
mashup
that
id
like
to
see
on
a
regular
basis
doomtree
look
for
it
local
very
nice
malty
spicey
piney
dry
finish
explodes
in
your
mouth
very
much
worth
trying
have
two
of
them
and
you
will
love
it
wasnt
for
me
spice
notes
struck
the
wrong
chord
sure
the
doomtree
name
is
enough
to
make
me
love
this
beer
however
it
has
a
subtle
home
brew
taste
that
made
me
fall
in
love
with
it
here
is
hoping
that
this
is
not
the
last
batch
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
give
it
a
try
if
you
see
it
bready
with
a
little
spice
and
a
lot
of
fruitiness
rye
shows
lots
of
orange
very
tasty
bitter
reminds
me
of
a
hopped
up
bitter
brewer
very
well
done
easy
to
drink
o
id
say
its
a
hybrid
rye
ipa
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
bit
of
a
leather
rubber
spicyness
that
some
may
not
like
but
i
think
its
fantastic
along
with
a
bit
of
sweet
tabacco
its
perfect
try
it
yum
picked
up
a
4
pack
pint
cans
it
tastes
really
good
the
smell
was
great
that
did
ut
for
me
the
feel
was
of
carb
and
subtle
bitter
slash
roastyness
w
great
smell
hmm
need
to
sample
many
more
very
little
head
that
stuck
around
while
drinking
citrushop
aroma
nice
hopy
body
with
a
belgium
tripleesq
finish
complex
taste
that
was
hard
to
pinpoint
this
offering
just
wasnt
for
me
not
bad
but
surly
still
overrated
in
a
can
at
the
doomtree
preparty
at
tipsy
cow
spicy
belgian
aroma
tastes
like
a
spicy
belgian
ipa
way
too
much
going
on
not
really
that
easy
to
drink
ok
beer
overall
interesting
and
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
all
come
together
as
well
as
it
might
im
surprised
to
see
it
classed
here
as
a
bitter
though
i
guess
surly
doesnt
tend
to
worry
much
about
style
guidelines
it
was
described
by
the
bartender
as
a
strange
love
child
of
furious
and
cynic
i
definitely
picked
up
on
the
traces
of
furious
and
there
is
some
spiciness
here
too
interesting
experiment
i
guess
but
it
doesnt
compete
with
most
of
their
other
beers
overall
unique
and
interesting
i
like
it
overall
a
pretty
unique
and
good
brew
good
balance
of
ripe
hops
and
toasty
malt
with
a
nice
bitterness
it
comes
off
like
a
blend
of
bitter
brewer
and
the
recent
black
ales
surly
has
been
doing
starting
the
super
bowl
evening
off
right
with
some
badass
ktina
kso
patent
pending
and
a
bitter
brewer
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
brasstawny
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
sharp
flowers
light
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
resin
for
the
sake
of
it
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
bready
biscuit
somewhat
tempering
the
grass
but
still
allowing
those
hops
to
shine
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
that
keeps
the
grassy
twang
from
malingering
overall
a
very
enjoyable
little
beer
something
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
more
of
in
the
future
if
not
tonight
even
not
a
big
fan
of
it
but
for
the
style
it
is
what
it
is
billed
as
mmmmm
biscuty
malts
poured
a
light
golden
color
light
sweet
aroma
interesting
taste
it
has
this
buttery
characteristic
that
reminds
me
of
abrasive
also
has
a
gritty
maltyness
to
it
its
decent
one
of
my
favorite
session
ales
right
there
with
day
tripper
from
indeed
and
go
to
by
stone
i
like
this
i
could
add
this
to
my
regular
rotation
so
crushable
tons
of
caramel
and
a
little
coffee
like
in
the
finish
deelish
o
very
flavorful
session
beer
that
emphasizes
orange
and
floral
hop
notes
balanced
out
by
some
toasty
malt
very
good
4
not
sure
id
call
this
an
esb
but
its
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
quite
good
for
what
it
is
has
a
nice
fresh
hop
profile
throughout
with
a
nice
malt
flavor
at
the
end
not
a
super
bitter
beer
but
definitely
more
bitter
than
sweet
bitter
brewer
is
pretty
tasty
but
it
reminds
me
a
little
too
much
of
a
session
ipa
which
is
a
style
that
im
rarely
impressed
by
still
worth
checking
out
though
maybe
not
at
the
price
of
3
19
a
can
i
like
the
fruitiness
of
this
beer
especially
fresh
on
tap
but
the
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
and
the
older
can
doesnt
hold
up
quite
as
well
3

brilliant
golden
brew
with
grassy
dank
resiny
aromas
that
are
contrasted
by
grapefruit
add
tangerine
with
a
hint
of
biscuit
malt
flavor
reveals
sharp
grapefruit
with
a
touch
of
tangerine
sweetnessa
light
crackery
malt
backbone
and
a
minerally
slightly
bitter
finish
wouldve
liked
more
citrus
than
minerally
notes
theres
a
clash
between
tart
lime
and
mineral
characters
that
doesnt
suit
my
palate
at
great
taste
pre
party
so
i
wont
get
technical
seems
to
be
a
nice
representative
of
the
style
served
too
cold
nice
appearance
light
copper
aroma
of
pine
mouthfeel
is
very
reminiscent
of
the
bitters
do
old
lower
carbonated
as
expected
biscuity
back
flavor
o
where
ive
found
most
bitters
lack
something
at
their
core
this
bitter
is
robust
and
fully
realized
ultimately
quite
satisfying
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
represents
an
exciting
entry
that
id
actually
reach
for
when
looking
for
a
brew
by
the
lake
where
i
need
to
keep
my
edge
o
definitely
an
americanized
version
of
the
style
i
do
like
it
but
it
isnt
going
to
be
a
seasonal
purchase
for
me
however
it
was
nice
to
come
back
to
it
after
5
years
surly
bitter
brewer
45
o
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
summer
great
to
bring
to
the
camper
for
the
weekend
and
drink
a
handful
overall
this
is
a
nice
session
pale
ale
but
in
terms
of
ratings
it
as
a
bitter
i
have
to
give
it
lower
marks
the
carbonation
is
too
much
and
the
hop
bitterness
goes
way
beyond
assertive
it
is
downright
intense
will
i
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
but
it
isnt
really
an
english
bitter
d
this
is
a
nice
little
bitter
and
would
go
great
if
served
as
a
real
ale
all
things
considered
it
is
well
balanced
and
offers
up
some
good
flavor
points
it
is
far
from
any
type
of
a
game
changer
but
i
dont
think
of
an
esb
in
that
regards
any
matter
just
a
really
well
crafted
brew
with
no
frills
glad
to
have
tried
but
not
something
i
would
probably
go
seeking
out
another
impressive
brew
from
surly
easy
to
drink
nice
balance
and
flavorful
well
worth
picking
up
overall
this
as
most
other
surly
offerings
has
not
failed
to
impress
the
tropical
and
citrus
hop
character
was
the
highlight
for
me
fans
of
surlys
ipas
will
likely
appreciate
this
one
o
first
english
bitter
ive
tried
enjoyed
it
o
extremely
sessionable
refreshing
but
never
boring
bitter
english
syles
arnt
really
my
thing
but
this
one
blew
me
away
drink
it
fresh
and
often
taste
is
indeed
bitter
upfront
with
some
creaminess
and
caramel
flavor
in
the
body
solid
esb
that
drinks
very
smooth
bitter
brewer
pours
a
darker
copper
color
with
a
small
dissipating
head
there
is
this
amazing
bitter
aroma
with
hints
of
hops
very
crisp
the
flavor
has
this
this
very
dry
crisp
taste
with
a
nice
mix
of
a
pale
malts
and
just
a
tad
of
hops
nice
full
flavors
and
body
and
finishes
with
this
amazing
dryness
overall
i
love
it
very
drinkable
flavorful
and
enjoyable
oan
easy
drinking
summer
beer
with
some
hop
bite
however
the
tealike
flavors
are
not
doing
anything
for
me
o
havent
had
a
lot
of
english
bitters
like
most
n
americans
it
seems
except
when
it
comes
to
this
one
but
this
one
finds
a
very
nice
balance
of
something
that
isnt
too
sweet
too
hoppy
too
heavy
just
a
perfect
pub
summer
sipper
if
anything
i
think
this
could
do
with
a
little
more
malt
complexity
and
would
like
to
try
it
on
cask
to
see
if
it
could
be
a
little
smoother
or
something
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
slighty
fizzy
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
closes
quite
dry
with
light
residual
stickiness
clinging
to
the
lips
and
palate
odthis
was
a
slight
disappointment
but
i
did
not
know
how
low
the
abv
was
until
i
looked
up
and
check
while
reviewing
this
was
a
pretty
neat
beer
but
i
think
its
a
bit
overrated
due
to
how
well
surly
is
received
in
the
craft
beer
community
overall
having
had
benchmarks
from
the
origin
of
the
style
this
doesnt
quite
measure
up
still
it
is
a
well
made
ale
and
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
nice
americanized
take
on
a
classic
bitter
although
way
out
of
style
with
the
hopping
will
be
drinking
more
of
these
this
summer
for
sure
really
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
overall
extremely
flavor
packed
and
sessionable
take
on
the
stylei
had
this
beer
outside
on
an
early
summer
day
and
it
was
a
great
fit
final
thoughts
a
decent
beer
that
fits
within
style
guidelines
while
still
unique
enough
to
pick
out
of
a
lineup
its
beers
like
bitter
brewer
that
give
hope
for
a
future
wave
of
low
abv
beers
being
the
craft
beer
trend
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
the
combination
of
american
hops
with
the
traditional
ingredients
found
in
an
englishstyle
bitter
works
incredibly
well
surly
hit
a
home
run
here
overall
an
awesomely
sessionable
beer
that
does
not
lack
for
flavour
whatsoever
whether
its
from
the
malts
or
the
hops
we
dont
have
the
chance
to
drink
much
english
bitters
at
all
but
this
is
definitely
a
style
im
into
its
a
good
one
to
drink
on
the
porch
in
the
summer
evening

pours
a
murky
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
bone

that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
and
tealike
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
4

i
am
willing
to
chalk
this
up
as
surlys
session
beer
and
to
be
honest
as
much
as
i
like
ipasdipas
its
their
aromaflavor
and
not
their
bitterness
that
appels
to
me
so
an
esb
is
not
a
favorite
style
this
is
a
solid
sessionable
offering
but
with
all
the
more
flavorful
options
from
surly
out
there
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
as
unfortunately
this
is
their
most
underwhelming
beer
on
my
palate
great
summer
seasonal
one
that
i
likely
overlooked
for
too
long
the
best
tasting
4
beer
youll
ever
drink
pours
an
opaque
amber
with
a
medium
head
the
nose
is
very
floral
with
some
spicy
hops
and
a
hint
of
sweet
caramel
flavor
has
earthy
tea
notes
and
pale
malts
with
mild
hoppy
spice
and
an
earthy
bitterness
finishes
with
a
subtle
hop
taste
that
lingers
the
perfect
brew
for
any
summer
activity
well
done
thanks
to
flax
for
this
one
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
stated
above
excellent
drinkability
and
at
4
abv
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
them
ive
really
been
impressed
by
everything
ive
had
from
surly
thus
far
glad
to
recommend
an
okay
beer
cheers
aaron
this
can
came
in
an
unexpected
but
very
welcomed
package
from
a
friend
who
has
family
in
minnesota
it
pours
with
a
warm
light
orangeamber
color
and
a
big
fluffy
sticky
head
the
aroma
provides
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
some
light
herbal
hops
the
flavor
likewise
blends
fruity
sweet
malts
with
a
bright
yet
somehow
musty
combination
of
hops
and
the
light
effervescence
further
lightens
the
flavor
profile
overall
this
beer
has
a
nice
earthy
quality
but
it
is
at
the
same
time
light
bright
sweet
and
quite
drinkable
drinkability
it
is
a
solid
tasty
and
sessionable
brew
perfect
for
the
twin
cities
future
mls
hooligans
addendum
well
ill
be
damned
if
the
sox
just
didnt
tie
it
after
vomiting
themselves
the
weakness
of
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
and
arguably
balance
the
resulting
beer
is
all
hops
and
in
order
to
keep
the
abv
down
the
malt
backbone
isnt
quite
there
that
said
this
is
no
thin
beer
there
is
lacing
left
on
the
glass
and
the
resulting
beer
is
still
quite
enjoyable
especially
on
a
warm
day
or
when
you
want
a
session
beer
o
overall
i
liked
this
better
somehow
than
surly
furious
a
very
tasty
english
bitter
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
expand
the
horizons
of
american
light
lager
drinkers
i
know
from
past
experience
that
when
bud
drinkers
try
something
from
stone
or
rogue
its
basically
like
culture
shock
to
them
but
this
beer
in
its
light
but
yet
solid
taste
of
dry
hops
etc
one
might
just
find
another
convert
to
the
world
of
great
ales
and
lagers
o
when
i
first
popped
this
can
and
took
a
swig
i
was
more
than
impressed
this
beer
was
really
packing
some
flavor
for
its
mild
4
abv
but
as
a
i
got
about
half
way
through
the
flavor
became
less
bright
and
much
darker
and
onenote
it
really
just
seemed
to
fall
off
i
do
wonder
if
this
beer
has
more
age
on
it
than
it
should
there
appears
to
have
been
a
valiant
attempt
to
date
the
can
but
the
date
is
illegible
that
is
resulting
in
some
of
the
earthy
flavors
that
seem
to
be
dominating
this
beer
tastes
very
much
like
it
smells
almost
like
a
very
light
west
coast
apa
only
with
surlys
excellent
yeastmanship
helping
hold
everything
together
the
hops
are
subtle
yet
variegated
the
malt
is
sweet
and
the
balance
is
superb

the
2nd
annual
redneck
racin
tastin
while
watching
the
dirt
track
race
big
thanks
goes
out
to
marine1975
for
this
one
served
from
can
into
a
shaker
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
bitter
hop
earth
and
earth
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bitter
hop
earth
and
earth
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
really
liked
the
hop
profile
on
this
one
as
the
earthiness
mixed
really
well
with
the
bitter
hops
while
it
was
good
it
definitely
didnt
stand
out
compared
to
other
brews
ive
had
from
the
style
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
again
as
my
review
ended
up
disappearing
yep
its
definitely
english
unique
and
stylish
nothing
memorable
about
this
one
just
refreshing
perfect
for
a
hot
and
humid
day
cant
recommend
o
surly
just
delivers
plain
and
simple
bitter
brewer
is
another
example
of
a
completely
drinkable
beer
that
is
full
of
flavor
best
english
bitter
i
have
ever
experienced
likely
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
ive
sampled
thus
far
though
the
u
s
hops
probably
diverge
from
stylistic
tradition
quite
a
bit
great
brew
from
the
folks
at
surly
i
look
forward
to
trying
many
more
of
their
offerings

if
you

for

pack

solid

no
real
complaints
here
not
a
bad
number
at
all
again
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
balance
in
the
taste
but
pretty
drinkable
enjoyable
this
is
an
excellent
session
ale
and
a
great
esb
perfect
for
the
summer
heat
great
taste
great
mouthfeel
and
looks
excellent
though
not
too
great
on
the
nose
session
beers
are
very
hard
to
get
this
high
of
a
rating
job
well
done
by
surly
do
this
pale
ale
features
nuanced
charms
that
seem
a
bit
retro
when
one
weighs
its
malt
focus
and
hops
that
maintain
a
complimentary
role
while
the
hop
qualities
are
never
really
featured
they
do
vary
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
flavor
profile
leaving
the
drinker
with
a
nagging
perception
of
inconsistency
its
english
qualities
are
wellcultivated
however
and
at
4
abv
it
drinks
as
easily
as
a
traditional
bitter
ought
to
d
overall
an
easy
and
light
drink
not
bad
and
very
easy
for
the
summer
id
pass
on
another
as
the
watery
texture
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
overall
i
enjoyed
honkers
ale
before
as
my
goto
bitter
ale
but
now
it
looks
like
i
have
a
new
favorite
it
looks
good
smells
great
tastes
great
and
feels
absolutely
refreshing
what
more
can
i
say
i
will
miss
surly
when
i
move
to
chicago
but
hopefully
i
will
see
it
once
i
move
there
overall
this
is
truly
a
worldclass
session
beer
so
much
flavor
in
such
a
light
bodied
low
abv
brew
the
only
draw
back
is
that
it
is
surly
so
it
is
not
cheap
at
9
per
4pack
my
go
too
brew
the
spring
campboating
trips
recommended
to
all
who
can
get
it
cheers
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
too
often
overlooked
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
o
definitely
a
unique
brew
with
a
pleasant
hop
mix
and
a
prominent
bitter
finish
well
crafted
o
this
stuff
is
incredibly
tasty
and
leans
more
on
the
hopped
up
english
bitter
than
a
traditional
bitter
loads
of
flavour
insanely
drinkable
and
an
all
around
scrumptious
ale
no
head
at
all
has
a
grassy
smell
analyte
mouthful
nonalcoholic
or
heat
when
it
goes
down
bitter
taste
you
can
also
taste
the
hop
more
than
you
can
taste
the
mall
its
got
this
fresh
hop
fail
flavored
as
well
as
woody
and
spice
and
very
low
carbonation
pours
a
slightly
cloudly
light
brown
with
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
subtle
and
nice
some
mild
hops
nothing
too
fruity
or
piney
up
front
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
all
about
balance
really
nice
hop
bitterness
with
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
going
back
for
more
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
which
contributes
to
its
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
if
i
lived
within
distribution
this
would
definitely
be
an
everyday
favorite
nothing
amazingly
out
of
the
box
but
that
is
not
what
they
are
trying
to
do
here
just
a
solid
brew
this
is
absurdly
drinkable
and
it
has
way
more
flavor
than
the
4
abv
would
imply
its
relatively
mild
but
that
is
the
point
for
the
style
surly
has
nailed
this
a
delicious
bitter
i
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
light
bodied
beer
and
extremely
drinkable
petty
layered
and
somewhere
between
clean
and
oily
more
towards
the
clean
side
yet
reasonably
crisp
slight
bitter
pinch
at
the
end
and
well
carbonated
overall
a
really
good
beer
perfect
beer
if
youre
not
sure
what
youre
in
the
mood
for
drinking
at
the
moment
o
awesome
sessionable
beer
i
cant
wait
to
order
a
bunch
of
this
when
it
drops
fresh
next
year
very
enjoyable
another
fine
beer
from
surly
o
a
great
session
brew
truth
be
told
this
isnt
a
favorite
style
of
mine
and
while
the
nose
isnt
true
to
the
style
its
more
enticing
to
me
than
the
dry
bitter
mouth
overall
very
clean
and
crisp
the
citrus
came
thru
in
the
taste
more
than
the
smell
which
i
loved
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
with
this
brew
cheers
o
lots
of
flavor
for
4
abv
not
quite
as
good
as
founders
all
day
or
21st
amendments
bitter
american
but
id
be
glad
for
one
of
these
any
day
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
sweet
citrus
hop
flavor
up
front
that
lingers
over
the

o
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
i
make
a
mild
ale
actually
that
is
similar
to
this
i
wouldnt
call
it
world
class
but
certainly
sessionable
3
ah
olde
english
ale
to
bad
bitters
arent
more
popular
i
could
drink
beer
like
this
all
day
long
this
is
what
session
beer
is
all
about
highly
drinkable
but
still
very
interesting
the
hops
really
linger
on
the
palate
and
remind
you
that
while
american
hops
may
have
assumed
superiority
english
varietals
can
still
be
very
enjoyable
could
drink
alot
of
this
a
nice
session
beer
overall
so
hoppy
that
it
isnt
really
genuine
to
the
style
lacking
the
malt
backbone
to
justify
the
hop
content
still
an
interesting
take
that
i
dont
mind
drinking
and
you
cant
beat
the
flavor
for
the
abv
o
unbelievably
good
for
a
beer
at
this
abv
only
stone
levitation
can
compare
in
the
lowabv
beer
category
a
fine
beer
to
have
at
a
pub
so
as
to
avoid
getting
shitfaced
definitely
a
bitter
beer
but
never
gets
close
to
the
palate
wrecking
ways
of
an
ipa
everything
about
the
flavor
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
bitter
another
very
good
job
by
surly
serving
type
can
d
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
it
was
good
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
body
and
also
looking
for
it
to
be
a
little
more
bitter
ive
had
a
few
more
esbs
that
are
a
tad
more
flavorful
def
give
this
a
try
though
o
not
a
bad
beer
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
deep
transparent
amber
orange
with
a
large
bubbled
cream
colored
head
the
nose
is
very
hoppy
orange
peel
and
leafy
hop
with
a
bit
of
stale
biscuity
bread
up
front
and
notes
of
tea
the
flavor
is
less
hoppy
and
has
a
bit
of
an
empty
finish
very
tea
like
some
herbal
leafy
hops
with
some
underlying
biscuit
thin
body
well
carbonated
lacks
depth
in
finish
o
a
very
welcome
flavorful
low
abv
brew
the
citrus
notes
are
quite
nice
o
i
really
liked
this
i
think
the
flavors
really
popped
off
the
body
in
a
very
unique
and
clean
way
it
was
like
taking
a
hoppy
trip
to
a
farm
setting
fire
to
it
and
then
making
a
clean
low
abv
getaway
i
enjoyed
thick
bitter
flavors
and
chewy
mouthfeels
but
i
dont
feel
trashed
i
need
to
drink
more
bitters
as
this
one
left
me
with
a
craving
for
more
bitter
sessionables
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
very
easy
drinking
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
probably
wont
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
brew
though
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
o
its
an
easy
drink
beer
i
was
expecting
a
bitter
beer
but
not
the
case
id
buy
a
4
pack
if
i
had
the
opportunity
not
bad
o
really
nice
session
beer
that
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
4
abv
beer
orange
marmalade
doesnt
come
through
as
well
as
the
nose
would
suggest
but
its
there
and
its
tasty
earthy
grassy
hops
lead
the
charge
bready
malts
showing
slate
like
flavors
and
fresh
baked
tea
cakes
great
carbonation
makes
this
beer
amazing
to
drink
at
this
abv
im
afraid
it
wont
last
long
do
simple
yet
highly
effective
this
is
now
the
best
lowest
abv
to
fullest
flavored
beer
ive
ever
had
bring
me
more
of
these
english
bitters
if
they
are
anything
like
this
as
i
am
quite
impressed
would
love
to
be
able
to
take
this
on
summer
outdoor
adventures
surly
again
bitter
brewer
looks
a
like
a
typical
bitter
if
a
bit
paler
and
more
golden
than
most
but
my
how
it
distances
itself
from
its
more
modest
english
roots
with
huge
orangish
fruit
flavors
its
in
the
nose
and
rules
the
taste
buds
the
beer
is
appropriately
dry
with
a
little
bready
malt
but
also
very
crisp
from
the
tangy
hops
this
is
a
beer
that
should
catch
the
attention
of
bmc
and
craft
drinkers
alike
its
very
hoppy
without
being
stupidly
bitter
o
a
simple
but
very
tasty
beer
would
make
for
an
excellent
sessioner
o
a
really
good
beer
if
i
wanted
to
have
several
beers
in
a
night
id
probably
go
this
direction
super
flavorful
d
i
fell
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
really
nice
flavors
and
complexity
yet
clocks
in
with
an
abv
slightly
above
4
this
is
probably
the
best
4
abv
beer
ive
ever
had
and
whenever
i
have
access
to
it
you
can
bet
im
buying
it
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
the
hops
in
the
nose
are
great
well
worth
a
shot
terrific
little
session
brew
here
i
could
pound
these
o
interesting
beer
its
a
much
different
beer
than
i
expected
tasting
but
strange
at
the
same
time
overall
a
great
session
beer
a
perfect
blend
of
english
malt
and
american
hops
who
knew
the
two
would
get
along
so
well
together
o
really
enjoyable
and
sessionable
brew
from
surly
think
it
couldve
packed
more
abv
considering
how
hefty
it
was
in
many
other
ways
but
i
wont
hold
that
against
it
definitely
worth
a
shot
with
unique
flavors
making
this
worth
another
try
o
this
is
pretty
good
also
pretty
weird
pours
a
hazy
cloudy
golden
orange
a
nice
bit
of
white
frothy
head
good
head
retention
smells
bitter
mildly
bitter
and
hoppy
but
more
sweet
and
earthy
than
anything
tstes
similar
low
impact
subtle
bitter
hops
compliment
a
very
smooth
sweet
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
really
impressive
on
this
beer
smooth
clean
thick
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
really
enjoyable
overall
surly
has
done
a
great
job
with
this
flavor
profile
perfect
for
the
summer
rotation
the
bitterness
is
only
one
piece
of
the
puzzle
dont
let
the
name
scare
you
away
easy
drinking
with
great
aroma
and
flavor
overall
its
pleasantly
bitter
and
easy
to
drink
although
the
nose
can
be
confusing
and
like
i
said
may
set
ones
mind
on
a
different
track
than
english
bitter
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
2inch
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
as
it
dissipates
big
fresh
and
pungent
hop
aromas
of
grapefruit
orange
and
pine
with
a
slightly
sweet
toasted
caramel
malt
backbone
taste
follows
the
nose
closely
lots
of
pungent
floral
hops
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
character
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
sharp
carbonation
great
beer
uniquely
american
take
on
the
english
bitter
style
o
again
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
was
expecting
but
for
me
thats
a
good
thing
i
look
forward
to
tying
more
in
this
style
to
see
if
this
is
an
aberration
extremely
easy
to
drink
if
this
were
more
available
i
would
be
buying
it
all
the
time
really
nice
session
o
so
confused
it
smelled
terrific
looked
great
and
tasted
like
flavored
water
extremely
disappointed
o
ive
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
english
bitters
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
them
and
definitely
the
most
citrusy
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
goodlooking
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
surly
cans
to
date
pours
a
nice
orangey
yellow
with
moderate
white
head
nose
is
decently
hoppy
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
a
toasty
malty
background
flavor
follows
suit
toasty
malt
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
and
bigger
hop
citrusy
flavor
the
marmalade
and
toast
comparison
made
on
the
can
is
not
far
off
though
i
might
not
think
of
it
as
quite
that
fruity
mf
is
decent
for
a
bitter
like
thislight
wellcarbonated
but
not
watery
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
its
a
nice
break
from
the
more
intense
beers
that
surly
makesa
nice
surlyesque
take
on
a
session
beer
kind
of
like
a
light
ipa
if
abrasive
is
a
double
ipa
then
this
is
a
half
ipa
nice
beer
worth
trying
wish
it
was
cheaper
than
the
other
surlys
though
o
definitely
would
recommend
a
four
pack
of
pint
cans
will
run
you
9
great
at
night
after
work
surly
knows
what
they
are
doing
thats
why
i
bought
the
kit
for
this
one
o
very
interesting
and
i
am
loving
it
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
good
frothy
head
smell
is
of
grass
and
pine
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
citrus
suggestion
and
a
very
dry
finish
at
4
abv
this
is
an
excellent
drinking
session
beer
with
a
much
higher
hop
profile
than
most
beers
with
a
lower
abv
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
drink
on
the
boat
during
the
summer
the
cpj
interesting
and
novel
a
good
beer
eminently
drinkable
but
ultimately
unexciting
i
have
a
feeling
this
would
have
been
a
dramatically
different
beer
in
june
and
i
imagine
that
its
great
on
cask
for
now
i
cant
see
myself
seeking
out
another
can
overall
definitely
a
solid
take
on
the
style
the
american
hops
really
brighten
the
whole
bitter
experience
and
make
it
something
unique
its
incredibly
drinkable
and
with
the
low
abv
even
more
so
thanks
jon
man
this
hits
the
spot
after
a
long
day
of
work
on
a
sticky
georgia
summer
day
nice
flavor
and
surprising
bitterness
for
a
low
abv
session
brew
o
goes
down
easily
tasty
not
too
filling
low
kick
nice
representation
of
style
at
first
this
beer
seemed
slightly
flat
but
actually
ends
up
working
out
well
oanother
well
balanced
beer
from
surly
has
a
lot
of
flavor
for
a
4
abv
beer
my
preference
would
be
for
a
slightly
less
bitter
hopped
taste
but
those
who
are
fans
of
this
style
will
likely
approve
pours
a

some

an
earthy

very
enjoyable
for
the
abv
full
of

o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
one
of
the
more
simpler
offerings
that
ive
had
from
surly
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
honestly
havent
had
many
beers
from
this
style
but
i
could
see
myself
easily
putting
a
few
of
these
down
very
sessionable
and
tasty
o
an
enjoyable
beer
that
if
it
had
a
bit
more
bite
it
would
be
a
very
sessionable
even
by
the
crazy
british
definition
the
beer
is
pretty
thin
i
would
like
a
touch
more
carbonation
and
body
after
all
this
isnt
cask
conditioned
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
has
multiple
nits
to
pick
over
i
drank
this
at
bryantlake
bowls
excellent
brunch
and
it
worked
very
well
as
a
compliment
to
breakfast
foods
i
have
to
imagine
that
it
is
better
out
of
the
can
though
as
this
wasnt
quite
the
beer
that
it
was
hyped
to
be
o
a
very
interesting
lightbodied
hoppy
brew
nice
work
on
this
one
surly
a
superior
session
brew
which
showcases
a
lot
of
flavor
in
a
highly
drinkable
package
color
is
dark
orange
with
head
the
disappears
quickly
it
has
a
lot
of
earthly
smells
to
it
along
with
some
citrus
the
taste
has
a
lot
going
for
it
considering
the
lower
abv
very
easy
to
drink
i
was
put
off
by
the
name
of
the
beer
for
awhile
but
after
receiving
it
as
a
gift
it
is
my
go
to
session
beer
in
the
summer
o
nose
is
great
but
goes
downhill
from
there
with
me
a
good
summer
beer
easy
drinking
low
abv
and
down
right
tasty
overall
a
great
summer
beer
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
stuff
when
its
hot
out
tons
of
flavor
while
still
being
extremely
quaffable
will
keep
a
stock
of
this
in
my
fridge
when
its
in
season
all
in
all
i
love
it
a
bit
more
potent
than
many
bitters
ive
encountered
and
one
of
the
most
flavorful
4
abv
brews
ive
had
in
a
while
but
that
makes
is
insanely
drinkable
and
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
few
more
pours
a
translucent
goldenbrown
the
nose
is
mild
hops
mild
malts
and
big
orange
like
tangerine
nice
the
taste
is
very
low
key
citrus
slightly
bitter
hops
and
some
proinounced
malts
a
lot
given
the
abv
goes
down
crazy
smooth
like
the
younger
sibling
of
a
good
apa
good
carb
and
nice
medium
mouthfeel
for
the
abvstyle
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
under
5
ive
ever
had
very
good
stuff
surly
can
brew
some
beer
o
a
very
sessionable
beer
and
perfect
for
warm
weather
not
one
of
my
favorite
surly
offerings
but
still
a
great
brew
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
very
nice
summer
session
ale
if
you
can
drink
sun
flowers
and
citrus
fruits
it
would
match
this
brew
o
delicious
brew
after
some
nice
hours
of
yard
work
well
crafted
malt
and
hops
with
a
great
malt
backbone
that
is
complimented
by
intense
bitter
hops
o
overall
another
good
beer
from
surly
this
one
had
a
lot
of
orange
and
citrus
to
it
was
a
great
beer
to
have
at
the
beach
would
certainly
like
to
have
it
again
o
as
recommended
by
romulux
a
great
bitter
and
refreshing
summer
beer
im
impressed
this
beer
brings
wonderful
flavors
and
complexity
in
a
tidy
little
4
abv
package
tasty
and
refreshing
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
it
as
i
said
a
fantastic
summer
drinker
though
likely
not
worth
multiple
repeat
purchases
considering
the
price
ill
stick
to
furious
or
bender
for
this
kind
of
money
overall
extremely
nice
and
super
sessionable
drinking
brew
i
just
wish
it
had
a
little
less
wet
character
in
feel
to
it
but
that
would
be
hard
to
pull
off
and
that
probably
wouldnt
represent
the
style
very
well
the
nose
on
this
is
just
flat
out
fantastic
overall
a
very
good
summer
brew
that
is
lighter
but
packed
with
flavor
good
balance
in
the
citrus
sweetness
bread
and
hops
overall
this
is
a
great
great
great
beer
in
the
english
bitter
category
this
passes
21st
amendment
bitter
american
as
my
new
favorite
beer
under
5
abv
extremely
drinkable
and
crisp
if
you
enjoy
a
nice
pale
alebitter
with
english
style
hopping
you
must
seek
this
out
highly
highly
recommended
o
its
been
years
since
my
last
experience
with
bitter
brewer
i
had
tried
a
can
which
was
far
past
its
use
by
date
and
it
really
put
me
off
a
wonderful
balance
of
flavors
light
and
crisp
perfect
for
summertime
thanks
again
surly
o
what
can
i
say
surly
continues
to
produce
delicious
beers
that
are
never
a
letdown
bitter
brewer
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
beer
till
its
out
of
season
very
drinkable
beer
can
consume
a
few
of
theses
no
problem
with
the
low
abv
4
oddly
enough
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
as
much
when
i
first
tried
it
last
july
maybe
my
palette
just
needed
some
development
because
now
i
think
this
one
is
fantastic
an
excellent
session
beer
too
bad
its
not
available
here
in
new
mexico
great
drinkability
low
abv
as
expected
and
an
overall
enjoyable
brew
overall
fantastic
take
on
a
style
i
dont
usually
enjoy
maybe
it
is
the
american
hops
providing
some
great
flavors
the
english
varietals
just
cant
deliver
surly
seems
to
not
know
how
to
a
mediocre
beer
lighter
medium
body
slightly
creamy
mild
carbonation
overall
extremely
smooth
and
pleasant
drinks
exceptionally
well
with
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
tempered
by
slightly
sweet
malt
profile
the
nose
was
a
little
subdued
but
everything
else
is
right
on
point
d
unbelievable
i
tried
this
not
because
i
like
the
style
but
because
i
love
surly
man
it
was
worth
it
best
dingworthy
session
ale
ever
an
easy
drinker
at
both
alcohol
by
volume
and
its
light
to
medium
body
with
tasty
finish
this
is
a
better
bitter
overall
a
good
beer
but
probably
my
least
favorite
from
surly
highly
drinkable
the
low
abv
makes
this
super
easy
to
sip
ding
would
be
proud
im
enjoying
a
session
ale
cheers
honey
colored
thats
more
orange
at
the
bottom
and
becomes
more
golden
at
the
top
1
finger
sticky
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
sticky
lacing
behind
smells
like
a
tropical
fruit
bowl
lots
of
flavor
packed
into
this
one
tangerine
grapefruit
and
other
citrus
flavors
some
sweet
and
pale
malts
to
round
it
out
the
mouthfeel
feels
light
for
the
complexity
and
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
but
i
think
its
exactly
what
the
brewer
was
shooting
for
this
is
the
best
session
beer
ive
had
yet
the
hop
profile
is
perfect
to
drink
a
few
with
out
having
palate
overkill
that
with
only
a
4
abv
makes
this
the
ultimate
session
beer
d
its
semieasy
to
drink
but
should
be
easier
at
4
ah
the
crack
glug
a
beautiful
thick
bubbly
two
fingers
of
ecru
head
sat
bubbling
creating
some
beautiful
lacing
as
it
began
to
sit
down
nose
was
a
mix
of
orange
zest
and
grapefruit
juice
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
the
taste
was
as
advertised
toast
and
marmalade
in
the
mouth
finish
was
much
more
pronounced
in
terms
of
the
marmalade
and
left
a
tingly
feeling
on
my
tongue
sorry
you
are
bitter
todd
but
this
was
suhwheet
i
am
envisioning
a
whole
cooler
filled
with
surly
beers
with
me
at
the
beach
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
noticeably
more
the
second
time
i
tried
it
i
can
only
assume
that
my
palate
changed
but
ill
be
sure
to
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
scored
these
at
buckbean
for
only
1
a
piece
proceeds
to
charity
these
were
the
surly
beers
that
didnt
make
it
from
canfest
on
tap
into
4oz
tasting
tulip
poured
a
light
clear
and
watery
copper
with
light
head
that
doesnt
last
the
aroma
and
taste
to
me
are
super
generic
versions
of
an
english
ipa
sugar
and
caramel
come
through
mostly
with
watery
metallic
hops
on
the
back
the
feel
is
too
watery
surly
mostly
nails
it
but
to
me
this
is
a
macro

shango42
on
the
palate
is
a
lightly
toasted
malt
flavor
with
a
light
bitterness
fruity
orange
and
a
leafy
woodsy
hop
flavor
come
together
for
a
deep
hop
profile
mouthfeel
is
on
the
wet
side
with
a
suprisingly
substantial
body
still
the
overall
character
is
nice
and
light
making
me
crave
another
session
beer
a
little
bit
of
a
bright
floral
earthy
combo
of
hops
is
noticed
right
off
the
bat
really
on
point
not
too
aggressive
but
just
assertive
enough
over
the
tastiness
of
the
malt
character
with
some
dried
apricot
as
well
the
taste
follows
as
well
with
an
upper
low
level
of
bitterness
it
is
clear
but
not
overpowering
the
great
classic
toastiness
of
the
malt
is
in
the
background
and
just
has
so
much
nuance
somewhere
between
a
slightly
overcooked
pie
crust
and
a
pancake
just
an
excellent
beer
that
makes
a
ton
of
flavor
and
subtlety
for
being
only
4
i
will
drink
this
any
day
d
pretty
drinkable
as
stated
earlier
it
is
way
too
carbonated
for
the
style
however
i
really
prefer
smoother
bitters
the
flavor
is
pretty
solid
abit
more
floral
hop
bite
than
normal
but
pleasant
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
not
the
most
drinkable
bitter
because
of
the
dryness
however
there
is
no
alcohol
to
speak
of
and
the
flavor
component
is
refreshing
i
like
the
hop
kick
near
the
end
which
is
showing
a
bit
of
american
flare
to
the
style
overall
a
winner
that
everyone
should
give
a
whirl
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
nice
light
amber
with
a
bubbly
white
head
about
an
inch
thick
the
aroma
is
wonderful
on
this
floral
hops
with
orange
sweetness
and
bit
of
oak
slightly
bitter
with
a
solid
malt
profile
the
taste
is
dry
and
absolutely
bitter
bitter
grassy
hops
with
light
malts
im
into
this
one
already
lamenting
that
i
only
have
one
can
left
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
subtly
carbonated
nothing
offensive
here
and
at
four
percent
a
tailor
made
session
beer
thats
easy
to
kick
back
and
enjoy
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
about
2
or
3
cm
thick
that
clings
all
over
the
glass
after
pouring
the
beer
has
american
hops
and
british
malt
the
nose
is
gently
hoppy
it
seems
that
the
hops
in
the
nose
is
imparted
by
the
flavoring
hops
and
that
there
wasnt
much
done
with
aromatics
gentle
flavor
of
hops
and
malt
working
together
the
body
of
the
beer
is
mostly
a
malty
read
and
there
seems
to
be
some
orange
zest
or
lemon
peel
or
both
light
body
and
finishes
very
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
ordinary
as
there
is
nothing
about
it
that
i
can
even
make
note
of
it
just
slides
down
your
throat
the
hops
seems
to
almost
get
lost
until
the
finish
and
aftertaste
the
brewery
itself
describes
the
beer
as
marmalade
flavor
so
i
guess
i
am
on
it
with
the
orange
the
english
malts
shine
through
on
the
flavor
with
a
perfectlyrestrained
sweetness
that
suggests
toffee
dates
and
mineral
water
yeast
adds
notes
of
tobacco
and
shoe
polish
with
a
healthily
bitter
floral
kick
on
the
finish
from
freshtasting
hop
cones
mouthfeel
is
aggressive
as
surly
beers
tend
to
be
but
not
overly
so
big
bubbles
from
the
co2
roll
across
the
palate
to
make
the
body
feel
even
thinner
than
the
style
dictates
still
bitter
brewer
is
an
excellent
take
on
an
obscure
style
wish
i
could
come
across
more
english
bitters
like
this
in
the
states
mfd
an
initial
buzz
of
carbonation
that
dissipates
as
quickly
as
it
hits
the
tongue
for
a
smooth
swallow
excellent
session
beer
we
need
more
beers
like
this
session
beers
that
are
moderate
in
alcohol
packed
with
flavor
and
keep
you
grabbin
for
more
get
bitter
d
sure
it
was
an
exhausting
day
and
all
but
good
lord
this
disappeared
quickly
ill
give
bb
credit
for
slaking
a
killer
thirst
but
moreso
for
having
a
perfectly
palatepleasing
blend
of
malt
and
hops
and
an
ohsosessionable
weight
bitter
only
that
i
dont
have
any
more
to
enjoy
drinkability
is
fine
i
think
this
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
getting
across
the
bitterness
of
todd
the
brewer
as
described
on
the
can
very
curt
brazen
bitterness
especially
considering
the
abv
quite
simply
if
i
this
beer
was
available
in
my
area
it
would
be
my
go
to
i
would
literally
always
have
a
case
in
my
fridge
sampled
at
stub
herbs
minneapolis
poured
this
beer
from
the
can
into
a
glass
and
was
a
liked
the
light
color
of
the
beer
i
didnt
like
the
smell
and
maybe
next
time
ill
just
keep
it
in
the
can
it
smelled
like
citrus
but
not
hop
citrus
but
as
if
there
were
some
additions
other
than
hops
to
aid
in
the
citrusness
i
was
also
a
little
put
off
by
the
body
i
know
this
is
a
light
beer
but
it
feel
really
dry
to
me
overall
this
is
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
for
the
style
this
a
good
overall
beer
d
very
nice
sessionable
beer
low
on
the
abv
great
drinkable
beer
the
feel
of
this
brew
is
a
bit
light
and
watery
and
modestly
carbonated
well
balanced
overall
it
lends
itself
to
being
quite
sessionable
and
not
only
is
it
easy
to
drink
down
the
16oz
but
i
would
have
another
if
available
overall
a
perfectly
crafted
session
beer
that
suites
me
to
a
t
i
know
the
traditional
english
bitter
doesnt
have
as
much
of
a
hops
presence
but
this
still
stays
remarkably
balanced
even
thought
the
malt
and
hops
are
amped
up
compared
to
a
british
version
this
is
a
respectable
nod
of
the
hat
towards
britain
while
still
keeping
the
independent
spirit
of
american
ingenuity
alive
and
kickin
love
this
ale
thanks
maximum12
for
this
bonus
in
our
trade
in
madison
wi
last
weekend
d
bitter
brewer
for
the
win
in
drinkability
i
could
pound
this
down
especially
in
the
summer
but
i
wouldnt
particularly
care
to
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
but
its
just
bland
and
bitter
bitters
are
slowly
becomeing
my
new
goto
beers
they
are
excellent
after
dinner
refreshing
after
cutting
the
grass
and
hell
fantastic
in
the
shower
d
could
drink
all
day
one
of
the
better
bitters
i
have
had
goes
down
so
easy
very
crisp
and
refreshing
serving
type
can
pour
into
a
nonic
eglish
pint

d
a
very
light
and
delicious
beer
beers
like
these
are
my
light
beer
equivalents
to
bmcs
a
very
delicious
and
sessionable
beer
thanks
shango42
d
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
that
certainly
fits
the
style
and
name
dry
and
bitter
not
exactly
my
most
favorite
from
surly
though
drinkability
very
drinkable
at
4
i
really
need
to
drink
some
more
english
bitters
as
they
are
an
underrated
style
very
easy
drinker
not
offensive
at
all
great
beer
cheers
i
have
yet
to
taste
an
unpleasant
beer
from
surly
poured
from
a
16oz
can
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
on
a
90
degree
hot
and
humid
day
pours
a
light
copper
with
medium
carbonation
and
has
an
off
white
soapy
head
a
nice
nose
of
lightly
hopped
citrus
aromas
with
some
light
malt
and
fruit
taste
starts
out
with
lots
of
toast
and
light
caramal
then
finishes
with
some
lighter
fresh
fruits
and
a
kiss
of
hops
this
has
a
nice
soft
texture
with
a
little
creaminess
to
it
but
also
has
a
nice
crisp
finish
this
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
d
another
low
alcohol
masterpiece
from
surly
i
have
gotten
to
the
point
where
i
am
confident
that
any
surly
product
i
try
will
impress
me
regardless
of
style
d
incredibly
drinkable
one
of
the
most
sessionable
every
day
beers
i
have
ever
had
d
every
sip
makes
me
want
to
take
another
very
nice
flavor
and
good
mouthfeel
makes
this
another
winner
from
surly
not
bitter
from
the
end
result
o
again
surprised
i
havent
review
this
yet
seeing
as
ive
been
enjoying
it
the
last
two
summers
but
i
suppose
its
appropriate
because
this
summer
ive
been
drinking
more
than
ever
love
this
beer
love
surly
i
had
3
more
of
these
and
i
totally
appreciate
this
brew
so
much
more
just
fantastic
d
easy
to
drink
this
beer
just
finished
the
can
after
throwing
the
baseball
around
and
it
was
refreshing
as
well
i
just
like
my
beers
to
have
a
little
more
body
but
not
bad
this
beer
slightly
reminds
me
of
the
bruerys
humulus
xpa
for
some
reason
i
dont
know
just
light
beers
a
perfect
cold
lighter
beer
for
the
summer
ive
had
bb
recently
in
a
can
and
it
was
much
better
overall
im
wondering
if
the
barrel
was
just
older
overall
this
is
the
definition
of
drinkable
just
enough
flavor
and
body
to
make
it
substantial
with
the
low
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
not
get
drunk
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
is
a
little
nutty
and
only
mildly
bitter
i
get
that
bitters
should
be
around
35
45
ibus
this
nails
that
it
gets
better
the
more
i
drink
it
there
is
some
graininess
on
the
palate
it
is
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
it
and
drank
a
couple
somewhat
hazy
darkgold
to
coppor
decent
white
head
and
some
sticky
lace
scent
has
a
lot
of
sweet
malts
fair
amount
of
fruit
tones
some
floral
hops
i
guess
the
first
word
that
hits
my
mind
when
i
taste
it
is
english
which
makes
some
sense
i
guess
although
bitters
arent
a
style
im
overly
familiar
with

this

its
got
a
great

quality
and

taste
as
well
as
some

that
all
blend
together
well
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
a

but
american
hops
instead
but
a
solid
attempt
at

goddamn
this
beer
is
drinkable
super
sessionable
followed
by
some
sort
of
sweet
candy
that
im
not
sure
of
the
name
of
2008

this

pours
a
slightly

with
a
nice

head
that
left
thin
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the

the
smell
is
straightforward

it
actually
really
surprises
me
that
the

aroma
is
so
prevalent
the
flavor
is
a
bit
disappointing

55thanks
to
a
buddy
of
mine
for
bringing
this
back
from
mn
this
summer
my
first
sample
of
this
was
at
the
whitefish
bay
fireworks
on
the
4th
of
july
and
it
was
delicious
even
out
of
the
can

and
the
malty
base
and

are
too
weak
to
match
up
to
the

a

with
low

somewhat

lacking

not
outstanding
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
one

this
may
be
too
extreme
of
a
small
beer
to
be
truely

highly
enjoyable
summer
beer
for
the
hop
lover
i
wouldcould
drink
a
bunch
of
this
on
a
hot
day
reminds
me
just
a
bit
of
gumballhead
great
flavor
bustling
with
hop
flavor
but
without
much
bitterness
it
just
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
imo
this
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
the
mbc
crowd
i
really
dig
this
brew
here
a
well
americanized
take
on
a
classic
english
stye
caramel
in
color
but
nice
and
clear
and
having
almost
a
full
inch
of
soft
white
head
the
nose
smells
like
desserty
english
malt
while
the
yeast
is
a
burton
or
something
similar
whats
unique
about
this
is
the
flavor
in
the
middle
it
has
an
almost
holiday
spice
cake
character
where
cinnamon
seems
obvious
but
maybe
some
molasses
and
clove
too
not
over
spicedor
even
spice
per
se
but
that
complexion
is
there
for
sure
before
its
all
cleaned
up
in
the
finish
loading
this
much
flavor
and
character
into
a
beer
with
such
low
alcohol
is
a
feat
unforced
and
natural
in
this
beer
and
very
impressive
clean
finishing
plenty
of
body
and
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
gladly
have
several
of
given
that
its
both
sessionable
and
different
well
done
here
by
rogue
i
prefer
this
to
the
massive
imperial
version
larry
o
outstanding
take
on
the
style
the
4
8
abv
is
well
hidden
and
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
for
an
evening
out
with
friends
there
is
a
nice
story
that
goes
along
with
the
name
of
this
beer
too
rip
don
ysb
is
a
decent
bitter
but
it
has
more
bitterness
than
flavor
o
a
pretty
good
bitter
but
not
the
best
of
this
style
from
rogue
ales
nicely
drinkable
killing
growler
wasnt
a
chore
glad
to
try
it
i
grabbed
it
thinking
it
was
a
special
brown
but
next
time
ill
stick
with
the
hazelnut
nectar
cheeuhs
excellent
example
of
a
british
bitter
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
this
side
very
full
for
a
beer
under
5abv
though
the
alcohol
content
still
makes
itself
known
wellbalanced
between
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
exactly
as
it
should
be
recomended
another
solid
offering
from
rogue
maybe
theyre
onto
something
with
this
pacman
yeast
overall
c
c
o
good
beer
drinks
easily
enough
and
still
maintains
its
wonderful
character
throughout
perfect
to
drink
several
pints
of
while
laughing
with
friends
45
overall
i
think
this
is
pretty
much
on
target
for
the
style
not
the
most
exciting
beer
in
the
world
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
overall
this
is
a
perfect
beer
period
i
wish
i
had
this
on
draft
in
my
house
it
is
extremely
hard
to
make
a
beer
of
this
abv
and
style
good
let
alone
packed
with
so
much
flavor
will
be
drinking
a
lot
more
of
this
in
the
near
future
especially
in
the
warmer
months
the
cpj
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
it
would
probably
fill
you
up
pretty
quick
if
you
order
it
at
rogue
be
sure
to
try
a
sample
first
deep
brown
body
no
visible
carbonation
1
finger
creamy
off
white
head
significant
lacing
nose
is
malty
goodness
caramel
taste
is
malty
but
with
a
nice
hop
hit
floral
and
grassy
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
minimal
effervescence
drinkability
is
superlative
light
refreshing
you
really
need
to
have
the
cask
version
to
appreciate
this
offering
now
i
see
why
the
old
tavern
rat
drinks
this
all
the
time
when
hes
not
drinking
scotch
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
how
good
this
was
definitely
worth
a
try
da
well
balanced
ale
that
brings
a
nice
malt
body
with
a
hint
of
sweet
hops
and
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
extremely
low
in
alc
and
very
easy
to
drink
make
this
something
i
could
enjoy
on
a
warm
summer
day
too
bad
im
snowed
in
give
me
a
ris
next
aroma
of
hops
and
some
citrus
poured
with
an
averagesized
creamy
frothy
white
head
diminished
to
about
12finger
size
over
time
body
is
ambercolored
and
hazy
the
flavor
definitely
has
hops
with
a
little
sweetness
that
is
the
citrus
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
and
a
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
also
as
you
pour
more
beer
the
yeast
adds
to
make
a
cloudy
body
which
is
the
reason
for
the
change
in
appearance
md
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
this
beer
goes
down
real
easy
nothing
jumps
out
it
is
just
a
solid
bitter
this
seems
like
a
very
agreeable
sessionable
english
bitter
with
a
pinch
of
west
coast
usa
thrown
in
for
good
measure
overall
this
was
a
very
very
nice
ale
to
sip
on
for
dinner
i
would
have
no
issue
with
having
this
one
again
any
day
another
lovely
beer
from
rouge
well
rounded
and
well
made
this
is
one
of
the
better
bitters
ive
drank
in
recent
memory
and
i
hope
you
het
the
chance
soon
d
my
first
rogue
beer
and
a
great
one
to
start
with
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
bitters
ive
had
so
far
and
quite
easy
to
drink
rogue

at
deciccos
in
ardsley
ny
pours
typical
darker
almond
amber
khaki
head
that
goes
all
tiny
bubbly
and
leaves
a
mess
of
fine
fine
lace
and
a
nice
shimmering
and
lightly
frothy
film
orange
peel
and
lighly
musty
nose
well
hopped
biter
nice
malty
under
coating
thoroughly
tasty
and
enjoyable
rogue
brew
pac
nw
all
the
way
with
the
healthy
hop
attack
shining
through
softly
citric
and
quite
appealing
clearly
quality
nicely
done
overal
and
nicely
balanced
brew
though
it
was
a
little
underpowered
for
the
steak
i
had
with
it
overall
this
was
one
of
the
better
bitters
i
remember
having
however
its
worth
noting
that
all
of
my
favorites
have
had
more
hops
than
are
standard
for
the
style
even
without
all
the
hops
the
solid
malt
bill
would
make
rogues
take
on
the
style
worth
a
shot
d
a
good
hoppy
example
of
a
bitter
would
repeat
a
tasting
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
hops
and
not
the
strength
of
an
ipa
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
a
nice
subtle
change
of
pace
from
rogues
usual
flavour
hop
and
alcohol
hammering
drinkability
i
definitely
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
i
enjoyed
the
moderate
bitterness
that
wasnt
trying
to
punch
me
in
the
face
i
can
definitely
see
myself
enjoying
this
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
relaxing
at
a
cookout
or
as
a
session
beer
i
will
definitely
be
trying
another
one
of
these
in
the
future
overall
a
well
balanced
and
delicious
ale
conclusion
a
nice
english
bitter
style
of
beer
more
malty
then
its
american
cousin
a
bit
offbalanced
but
still
very
enjoyable
after
cleaning
up
the
initial
disaster
this
got
poured
into
a
mug
a
cloudy
amber
color
results
with
some
decent
frothy
head
which
evaporates
sporadically
what
remains
laces
down
the
glass
smell
was
of
some
caramel
malts
taste
was
bitter
obviously
with
some
floral
sweetness
no
real
excessive
carbonation
potentially
used
it
all
up
earlier
leaves
the
mouth
dry
with
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
a
decent
bitter
overall
decent
attempt
well
crafted
but
rogue
got
a
tad
carried
away
with
the
citrus
hop
for
it
to
be
a
topnotch
english
bitter
if
there
was
an
american
bitter
then
this
would
score
a
lot
higher
a
nice
example
example
of
how
americans
can
make
a
decent
english
bitter
the
alcohol
content
is
not
listed
but
it
feels
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
which
are
qualities
that
you
wont
see
in
typical
american
beers
that
use
a
lot
of
hops
or
specific
hops
notes
a
slightly
offbalance
bitter
if
only
because
it
seems
like
its
just
an
exaggerated
recipe
its
both
big
on
the
fruity
notes
and
big
on
the
bitter
tasty
and
sessionable
had
this
as
the
fat
heads
ale
at
fat
heads
in
pittsburgh
on
tap
came
in
light
brown
body
with
minimal
head
that
died
and
left
no
real
lacings
a
citricleafy
hop
aroma
would
be
the
best
way
to
characterize
the
smell
a
little
oilybuttery
slickness
in
this
thinbodied
beer
but
the
hops
do
come
through
in
a
herbal
tealike
punch
and
there
is
a
moderately
dry
backbite
an
easy
to
down
beer
that
i
recommend
great
carbonation
and
not
thick
by
any
means
very
easy
to
drink
and
slightly
mild
in
the
alc
dept
maybe
5

if
you
are
lucky
go
get
one
or
three
drinkability
a
pretty
fine
example
of
a
style
that
is
rarely
brewed
on
this
side
of
the
pond
very
enjoyable
drinkable
brew
and
one
of
the
best
rated
active
bitters
side
note
goes
well
with
the
rogue
house
chili
as
well
pours
clear
amber
with
a
minimal
white
head
aroma
is
full
of
peppry
hops
caramel

rosemary
and
the
normal
rogue
yeast
sweetness
taste
is
spicy
hops
with
some
citrus
anda
sweet
caramel
malt
backing
a
bit
bitter
in
the
finish
kind
of
thin
not
your
normal
bitter
but
definitely
another
great
beer
from
rogue
poured
a
copper
red
color
this
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
smelled
floral
and
hoppy
tasted
hoppy
but
pretty
malty
also
med
bodied
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
drink
this
stuff
like
water
d
a
well
made
american
version
of
a
classic
english
style
well
balanced
and
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
taste
is
euro
bitter
hops
complex
malts
and
slightly
astringent
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
some
leather
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
and
some
hops
that
dont
belong
it
misses
the
english
bitter
style
that
being
said
this
is
a
terrific
beer
whatever
it
is
i
have
had
other
northwest
esbs
that
are
similar
to
rogues
so
call
it
a
nw
esb
very
tasty
indeed
it
gets
even
more
pleasant
as
the
bubbles
subside
and
it
warms
up
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
this
on
tap
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
color
with
plentiful
dense
offwhite
head
aromas
are
very
toasty
biscuity
a
touch
of
caramelish
toffee
and
just
a
touch
of
floral
hops
on
the
palate
a
dense
malt
profile
really
blossoms
all
that
toasty
caramel
like
sweetness
really
pulls
through
with
a
slight
dark
molasses
like
touch
the
hops
are
certainly
in
check
hop
flavor
is
further
relegated
to
the
back
and
finish
of
the
beer
with
floral
slightly
spicy
tones
evident
this
malty
beer
still
manages
to
finish
relatively
dry
and
bitter
perhaps
a
high
sulfate
water
helps
no
too
bitter
but
nice
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
nice
session
brew
nice
session
worthy
bitter
from
rogue
this
stuff
fits
the
bill
quite
nicely
decent
balance
and
after
a
22
oz
bomber
im
craving
another
one
still
d
this
is
a
fantastic
englishstyle
bitter
imo
all
the
right
flavours
are
there
and
it
is
not
thankfully
overlyhopped
another
winner
from
rogue
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
well
worth
the
price
but
if
you
do
order
a
pint
of
youngers
special
bitter
d
this
beer
is
decent
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
like
ive
said
about
rogue
in
other
reviews
for
me
theyre
hit
or
miss
golden
in
color
with
medium
white
head
aroma
of
citrus
and
light
caramel
malt
nice
hop
citrusgrape
and
sweet
malt
taste
but
not
to
complex
medium
body
beer
and
a
long
bitter
finish
good
beer
very
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
a
goodquality
example
of
an
english
bitter
not
necessarily
a
great
style
but
a
really
decent
beer
for
daily
drinking
the
price
tag
makes
it
a
bit
steep
though
this
isnt
an
english
bitter
nor
is
it
an
esb
its
closer
to
an
american
pale
ale
than
anything
else
but
i
guess
the
goal
of
this
beer
is
an
imperial
english
bitter
pretty
darn
good

with

and

it
has
a
great
a
true
bitter
but
bitter
enough
to
make
it
interesting
and
worth
drinking
a
bomber
of

just
the

i
like
it

i
like
it
not

by
any
means
theres
just
flavors
in
it
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
and
couldnt
tell
if
i
liked
it
it
is
better
than
ok
also
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more

it
really
doesnt
stand
out
from

pack
but
next
time
i
may
pair
this
one
with
a
pizza
overall
the
hops
in
ysb
are
more
subdued
and
balance
well
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
very
easy
drinking
and
not
over
done
on
the
hops
it
might
be
the
most
balanced
beer
rogue
puts
out
this
might
be
the
best
session
beer
rogue
has
out
there
certainly
an
american
take
on
a
bitter
but
a
well
done
one
and
one
that
could
be
quaffed
all
night
without
problem
this
was
a
beer
that
has
high
expectations
but
fell
just
a
little
short
it
poured
a
dark
orange
color
with
about
an
inch
of
white
foam
that
left
patches
of
sticky
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
quite
lite
with
a
very
sweet
malty
scent
and
slight
scents
of
orange
the
taste
was
a
little
weird
with
a
thick
malt
hit
in
the
beginning
that
threw
me
off
and
reminded
me
of
marsala
wine
a
decent
breadiness
in
the
middle
and
a
slightly
bitter
hop
finnish
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
the
taste
was
just
a
little
off
to
me
try
it
for
yourself
clear
orangeamber
pinky
high
ivory
cap
becomes
fluffy
and
crusty
looking
as
it
slowly
dwindles
down
to
a
thin
haze
on
top
and
a
thin
collar
lace
in
minimal
strings
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
very
subdued
barleywineesk
nose
some

a
bit
toasty
slight
pine

sweet

mostly
dry
hop
leaves
and
floralness

the
back
end
in
bigger

taste
is
nice
and
mild
welcoming
warm
toasty
malts
favor
from
front
to
back
some
refined
and
soft
malt
sweetness
of
breads
and
dull
fruit
keep
it
smooth
and
tolerable
to
the
palate
theres
a
nice
subtlety
about
its
approach
floating
and
caring
malt
character
with
the
same
amount
of
comfort
with
the
hop
profile
which
has
very
slight
floral
citrus
and
pine
mindfully
placed
in
different
areas
throughout
the
palate
feel
is
light
and
fluffy
with
a
firm
and
sturdy
smoother
lighter
body
which
seems
to
fit
this
here
making
for
a
nice
little
drinker
this
is
one
of
the
few
12oz
bottles
with
a
paper
label
that
rogue
distributes
which
is
a
bit
weird
cuz
i
really
like
seeing
the
ingredients
listed
like
on
their
bombers
oh
well
label
no
label
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
tawnycoppery
gold
in

this
has
a
lovely
color
slightly
hazy
too
a
skimpy
white
head
of
a
half
finger
briefly
formed
it
actually
faded
to
a
soapy
cap
before
i
could
set
my
glass
down
after
the
pour
no
subsequent
lacing
the
nose
is
brighter
than
a
traditional
bitter
as
expected
by
rogue
the
hops
shine
with
good
citrusy
depth
it
is
very
fleshy
with
its
grapefruit
notes
sharp
pine
notes
follow
however
before
the
bouquet
ends
the
malt
becomes
noticeable
with
its
biscuit
and
caramel
aromas
i
like
the
fragrance
it
is
straightforward
but
inviting
the
palate
is
tasty
and
deadon
as
to
what
the
nose
told
me
what
to
expect
the
hops
are
a
little
juicier
and
the
flavors
are
a
bit
wider
as
they
encompass
both
lemonlike
citrus
and
grapefruit
as
the
hops
conclude
on
the
palate
they
become
very
dry
which
is
quite
nice
random
orange
flavors
sprung
up
long
hoppy
aftertaste
which
seems
more
a
kin
to
an
apa
this
is
no
surprise
as
rogue
is
often
hard
to
pinpoint
a
style
on
the
malt
doesnt
say
much
and
it
is
very
secondary
only
offering
suggestions
of
biscuits
and
caramel
hints
once
the
beer
warmed
to
room
temperature
i
thought
it
fell
apart
a
little
i
was
a
bit
too
slow
drinking
it
i
guess
for
the
most
part
this
beer
is
damn
tasty
and
only
modestly
bitter
medium
in
body
moderate
but
natural
feeling
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
this
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
enjoyable
true
it
is
quite
tame
compared
to
other
rogue
beers
im
not
knocking
it
though
i
bought
a
12ounce
bottle
in
iowa
city
for
1
80
id
drink
it
again
geez
i
wish
this
was
available

i
was
about
to
do
the
usual
but
i
have
been
eyeing
this
bitter
for
quite
awhile
what
the
hell
ill
be
crazy
so
this
stuff
pours
out
a
very
nice
deep
copper
with
not
much
of
a
head
awesome
color
though
the
aroma
is
hoppy
but
also
has
a
very
nice

in

this
is

really
hyped
like
alot
on
draught
at
fat
heads
in
pittsburgh
i
am
pretty
sure
this
is
rogues
esb
despite
the
fact
that
our
server
told
us
it
was
brewed
especially
for
fat
heads

creamy

and
nicely
bitter
hops

citrus
flavors
the
finish

somewhat
dry
with

hops
overall
pretty
good
exclusive
beer
this
amber
ale
had
little
head
but
a
lot
of
pride
the
aromas
of
hops
and
spices
was
quite
inviting
unfortunately
the
flavors
in
the
beer
werent
much
more
complex
while
the
bitter
had
an
amazing
balance
between
the
malts
and
the
bittering
hops
it
seemed
that
the
spicy
notes
were
distractingly
strong
while
they
would
have
been
a
pleasant
background
effect
the
cask
tasted
a
bit
like
a
spiced
beer
that
was
modeled
after
an
esb
the
dry
tangy
finish
was
quite
pleasant
the
beer
was
good
but
not
outstanding
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
assuming
of
course
that
you
like
hops
although
it
is
nowhere
near
as
hoppy
as
the
big
double
ipas
it
could
bee
too
much
for
yellow
beer
drinkers
a
rather
dry
finish
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
not
that
remarkable
good
overall
brew
from
a
good
overall
brewery
poured
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
some
carbonation
that
lasts
all
the
way
through
nice
notes
of
malts
and
a
hint
of
caramel
come
through
taste
this
is
a
bitter
tastes
somewhat
similar
to
fullers
esb
if
anything
hops
and
malts
collide
against
the
palate
with
some
toasted
flavors
and

i
would
have

it
as

the

may

this

is

is

is
yet
another
quality
beer
from
rogue
ales
english
bitter
isnt
a
style
that
im
familiar
with
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
thankfully
its
available
in
my
local
grocery
drinkability
pretty
tasty
stuff
it
could
grow
on
me
easily
should
appeal
to
the
hop
lover
in
us
all
had
at
redbones
clear
dark
amber
when
poured
it
came
with
a
decent
piney
aroma
it
starts
with
a
smooth
malty
touch
which
runs
into
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
ends
in
a
nice
hop
finish
but
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
dry
as
it
could
be
not
a
bad
beer
but
slightly
syrupy
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
surrounded
by
their
signature
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
malty
palate
with
a
bitter
finish
it
is
filled
with
hops
again
in
the
taste
its
good
but
i
wish
they
would
back
off
the
hop
flavor
on
this
one
so
that
the
true
malt
character
can
be
revealed
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
goes
down
easy
but
i
dont
think
its
true
to
the
style
that
said
i
could
drink
this
until
the
cows
come
home
smelled
of
florals
rose
petals
and
fresh
cut
grass
lots
of
hops
and
slightly
tart
medicinal
smell
taste
was
hop
concentrated
to
start
striking
bitterness
big
and
unbalanced
almost
crystal
and
carmel
malt
way
in
the
background
lacked
any
bready
biscuit
sweetness
and
body
medium
to
light
bodied
very
good
and
drinkable
but
i
think
the
hop
flavors
were
a
touch
overdone
and
aggresive
tasted
to
me
like
a
west
coast
version
of
english
bitter
which
it
is
but
i
guess
not
what
i
had
expected
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
disappears
virtually
altogether
the
aroma
has
quite
a
bite
hops
with
nettlelike
character
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
unexpectedly
so
and
the
flavor
is
mild
and
pleasant
the
hop
bitterness
is
present
but
not
biting
like
it
is
in
the
aroma
this
was
much
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
bitter
but
blended
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
terrific
session
brew
this
was
a
great
american
bitter
on
cask
the
carbonation
was
so
light
and
made
the
ale
absolutely
great
the
head
was
thick
and
lasted
for
the
whole
beer
the
color
was
red
with
a
slight
orange
tint
the
hops
were
very
present
in
the
nose
very
clean
hops
commanded
the
first
taste
as
you
moved
through
the
beer
the
warm
temperature
and
low
carbonation
made
the
ale
absolutely
great
the
biscuity
malt
was
a
great
balance
to
the
bitterness
which
had
hints
of
citrus
and
grass
a
great
caskconditioned
ale
i
was
disappointed
with
rogues
offering
here
it
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
solid
head
that
had
decent
retention
the
smell
was
rather
weak
and
all
that
i
could
get
was
hops
the
body
in
this
beer
was
what
hurt
it
to
me
no
body
it
almost
tasted
like
many
homebrews
that
i
have
had
before
low
consistency
malts
were
faint
and
few
maybe
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
and
grainy
base
hops
were
present
but
werent
that
bitter
more
flavoring
hops
in
this
case
it
wasnt
the
worst
beer
the
flavors
mixed
well
and
really
was
about
average
in
terms
of
style
but
im
expecting
more
from
rogue
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
a
perfect
session
beer
any
time
of
the
year
very
well
done
easily
among
my
favorite
session
brew
choices
a
treat
every
time
pours
a
clear
tealike
color
with
a
112
finger
offwhite
head
the
aroma
consists
of
a
citrus
fruit
smell
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
grapefruit
tartness
the
taste
has
an
initial
bite
from
the
light
carbonation
and
pronounced
hops
that
tingle
your
tongue
and
slides
into
a
toasty
malt
flavor
and
tapers
into
a
slight
grassy
taste
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
brew
that
finishes
slightly
watery
which
is
not
what
i
expected
from
this
style
still
not
terrible
but
perhaps
not
the
best
offering
from
a
brewery
in
which
i
hold
in
high
regard
cheers
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
almost
like
a
pale
ale
this
was
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
on
tap
at
horse
brass
in
portland
served
in
a
10
oz
miniimperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
clear
reddishamber
with
a
thin
fine
white
head
the
brew
possessed
a
mild
resinycitrusy
boquet
of
hoppiness
very
nice
for
the
style
in
the
taste
was
the
right
balance
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
malt
character
this
made
for
a
very
tasty
and
crisp
beverage
the
mouthfeel
could
have
been
thicker
but
was
still
within
specs
for
the
style
carbonation
was
a
bit
low
too
but
could
this
have
been
particular
to
the
keg
at
hand
the
drinkablitly
was
great
overall
a
tasty
and
refreshing
bitter
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
minimal
white
head
and
splotches
of
lacing
not
much
on
the
nose
other
than
a
hint
of
pine
and
sour
citrus
mouthfeel
is
light
to
mediumlight
bodied
dry
and
bitter
and
ample
carbonation
taste
has
caramel
malt
pine
and
grapefruit
but
is
bitter
overall
very
dry
finish
is
clean
and
refreshing
nice
american
example
of
the
english
style
pours
a
medium
abber
with
not
much
head
to
it
very
light
and
fades
quicklythe
aroma
seems
more
on
the
malty
side
lightly
fruity
and
some
caramelnut
tones
a
nice
mix
heremore
of
a
malt
tilted
brew
wich
is
somewhat
sprising
coming
from
roguenice
biscuit
malt
flavor
with
some
light
sweetness
finishing
with
some
pineylike
hop
flavors
one
of
my
favorite
ones
from
rogue
wich
sometimes
overhop
their
brews
in
my
opinion
ng
served
at
cellar
temperature
medium
brown
in
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
layer
coating
the
top
of
the
beer
hops
really
dominates
the
smell
with
a
little
hint
of
caramel
tastes
relatively
thick
with
a
smooth
taste
that
finishes
off
with
a
nice
bit
o
hops
as
easy
drinking
as
it
gets
gives
the
hop
lover
all
heshe
needs
without
being
over
the
top
an
essay
in
balance
which
is
not
common
from
the
rogue
people
outstanding
but
hey
were
talkin
rogue
here
theres
a
hopmalt
balance
typical
of
the
style
here
the
hops
refresh
the
malt
fills
in
the
blanks
id
have
one
or
two
more
certainly
again
it
is
indicative
of
the
british
bitter
style
and
while
not
a
clone
of
any
one
specifically
its
a
pleasant
example
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
by
any
one
component
of
this
beer
but
it
seems
a
case
of
the
whole
being
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
drinkability
if
you
like
bitters
this
could
be
your
cup
of
tea
the
sixer
i
purchased
shouldnt
last
too
long
i
should
think
wonderfully
balanced
beer
dark
copper
color
a
tad
bit
on
the
cloudy
side
this
beer
is
an
awesome
session
beer
i
so
wish
i
could
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
the
hops
are
in
this
beer
both
flavor
flowery
slight
citrus
bittering
and
they
are
perfectly
balanced
by
the
malt
overall
this
is
a
nice
nice
bitter
i
feel
like
i
should
be
in
a
yorkshire
pub
enjoying
this
one
a
drinkable
beer
indeed
but
more
like
apacific
pale
than
a
bitter
imo
nice
enough
bitter
but
not
something
ill
probably
remember
days
down
the
road
pours
a
hazy
medium
copper
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
consists
of
sweet
caramel
floral
hops
candied
raisins
and
butterscotch
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumtofullbodied
initial
smoothness
gives
way
to
a
stinging
carbonation
on
the
tongue
which
lessens
as
the
beer
warms
fruity
and
juicy
hop
flavors
dominate
theres
a
very
nice
roasted
malt
and
caramel
flavor
underneath
finish
is
moderately
bitter
and
hints
at
a
dryness
that
never
quite
materializes
the
bitterness
is
balanced
pretty
well
with
the
malt
flavor
and
actually
i
thought
the
beer
would
have
been
more
bitter
than
it
was
nuances
in
the
flavor
really
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temps
the
water
almost
seems
to
have
an
english
hardwater
quality
to
it
a
very
nice

some

this
is

very

subsided
into

is
good
as
it
contributes
to
the
smoothness
of
the

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
though
i
would
rather
have
other
better
beers
that
rogue
makes
instead
of
this
one
a
mouthfeel
that
is
dry
and
buttery
at
the
same
time
easy
to
drink
many
in
one
session
well
it
does
have
alcohol
in
it
so
not
too

one
its
a

rich
flavor
with
nice
caramel
and
some
fruity
flavors
being
topped
off
by
a
great

this
is
definately
a
nice
beer
if
i
wasnt
the
poorest
sorriest
college
student
there
ever
was
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
would
inhabit
the
entire
top
shelf
of
my
fridge
it
pours
a
godly
amber
hue
with
a
moderate
yet
longlasting
head
the
distinctive
rogue
flavor
sits
behind
a
powerful
contingent
of
hops
a
fantastic
brew

that
i
shall

it

where
cascade
seems
to
run
the
show
its
nice
to
enjoy
a
different
flavor
of

an
enjoyable
beer
a
good
gateway
or
session
beer
my
initial
aroma
shot
is
of
a
very
pleasant
floral

aroma
the
malt
qualties
dont
present
themselves
later
pours
with
large
full
head
that
breaks
down
slowly
very
clear
orange
amber
color
with
the
flavor
im
again
taken
by
the
strength
of
the
hops
presence
the
malt
balances
and
smooths
off
the
hops
thus
preventing
the
drink
from
being
to
bitter
but
arent
offering
enough
of
a
presence
to
make
it
a
malt
based
beer
even
with
warming
the
malt
didnt
make
enough
of
a
presence
nice
smoothness
to
the
mouthfeel
making
it
an
easy
drink
a
good
tasting
beer
but
not
a
fine
enough
sample
of
style
not
sure
why
my
sample
is
different
than
others
no
dating
on
the
bottle
to
give
a
hint
as
to
that
issue
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
dark
reddishamber
color
with
only
half
a
finger
of
head
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
begins
with
hops
up
front
then
some
caramel
and
maple
maltiness
comes
through
the
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hops
bits
of
toffee
and
grass
are
present
the
body
is
fairly
smooth
but
just
a
bit
oily
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
for
this
great
session
bitter
a
nice
hazy
copper
color
when
poured
at
the
brewery
while
on
tap
the
taste
unlike
the
bottle
version
which
had
caramel
and
malts
this
tap
version
had
a
awful
sour
after
taste
that
made
this
ysb
unpleasant
and
undrinkable
drink
the
bottled
ysband
stay
away
from
the
tapped
ysb
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
orange
color
with
a
large
rocky
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
earthiness
the
taste
is
mild
maltiness
balanced
by
a
crisp
earthy
hoppiness
with
a
silky
rounded
mouthfeel
a
very
enjoyable
drinkable
mild
bitter
that
is
fairly
well
balanced
good
beer
kind
of
subtle
for
a
rogue
grassy
smell
and
taste
not
overly
bitter
but
i
had
a
stone
ruination
prior
so
that
may
have
blasted
my
taste
buds
this
is
an
unusual
offering
nice
but
not
outstanding
smooth
somewhat
thin
it
was
somewhat
refreshing
to
have
a
rogue
that
wasnt
overly
dry
and
bitter
but
this
is
not
a
standout
imo
clear
copper
color
with
a
thick
chunky
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
somewhat
fruity
with
a
slight
graininess
and
a
bit
of
malt
it
has
a
spicy
hop
flavor
with
a
malty
background
that
balances
out
the
hops
it
has
a
slight
fruitiness
in
it
as
well
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
it
has
a
bitterness
that
sticks
with
you
overall
it
is
an
average
beer
with
decent
drinkability
this
beer
poured
a
light
orange
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
lacing
and
a
somewhat
citruslike
aroma
the
taste
told
me
that
it
was
definitely
a
bitter
and
nothing
else
if
you
like
bitters
this
is
a
good
bitter
i
enjoyed
it
and
actually
went
back
for
seconds
a
nice
beer
wow
another
great
ale
from
rogue
this
is
fastly
becoming
my
favorite
brewery
beautiful

with
a

i

i

not

is

fortunately
not

one

the

on

it

is

an
enjoyable
ale
but
nothing
more
o
this
was
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
easily
quaffable
with
a
good
balance
of
flavors
nothing
extraordinary
but
just
good
my
first
cricket
hill
try
pours
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
clear
auburn
color
with
a
thin
wispy
white
head
atop
some
caramel
toffee
and
butteriness
mainly
in
the
noseno
hop
presence
really
to
be
had
has
a
pretty
nice
feel
to
it
with
low
carbonation
flavors
are
somewhat
fruity
with
a
toffe
malt
base
but
not
overly
sweeta
smattering
of
earthyleafy
hops
in
the
finish
this
beer
might
be
better
served
to
be
a
little
lighter
in
alcohol
at
5
5
its
not
a
real
sociable
ale
but
it
doesnt
have
enough
stuff
going
on
to
grab
over
a
more
well
hopped
beer
of
the
same
size
to
be
honest
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
unibroue
tulip
small
head
with
low
retention
little
to
no
lacing
hazy
dull
copper
body
aroma
is
mainly
rich
in
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
mildy
bitter
caramel
sweet
slight
molasses
and
slightly
spicy
on
the
tongue
good
tasting
beer
however
not
sure
if
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
this
really
wish
there
was
a
bottle
date
to
check
for
freshness
or
some
description
on
the
label
looks
good
taste
is
nice
but
seems
thicker
than
i
would
expect
and
a
bit
more
pale
ale
than
bitter
still
it
works
for
the
most
part
i
wouldnt
hold
it
up
against
any
productions
from
the
other
side
of
the
pond
but
its
a
nice
drinker
overall
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
in
finding
but
a
pretty
sweet
cast
ale
found
at
your
local
six
pack
shop
o
the
color
seems
to
be
a
bit
darker
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
the
aroma
could
be
a
bit
stronger
but
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
especially
from
the
taste
perspective
the
bitterness
is
just
the
right
amount
and
the
proper
flavor
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
i
could
likely
have
more
than
one
though
i
do
not
know
that
i
would
call
it
sessionable
this
beer
is
an
orangeamber
colored
liquid
completely
clear
with
a
slim
white
head
the
aroma
is
faint
a
little
biscuity
bready
malt
and
just
whiff
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
however
is
more
aggressive
brilliant
balance
cracker
and
breadlike
malt
flavor
backed
very
nicely
with
a
solid
malt
bitterness
there
is
a
touch
of
fruit
orange
peel
and
apricot
the
beer
is
a
little
more
carbonated
that
id
like
especially
given
the
name
cask
ale
still
its
got
a
mediumbody
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
nice
session
brew
the
flavors
and
aromas
of
beer
and
food
trigger
emotions
and
memories
for
me
just
like
music
colonel
blides
cask
ale
is
one
that
does
not
disappoint
when
brewing
my
own
one
style
i
continually
attempted
to
perfect
was
an
english
cask
conditioned
ale
from
time
to
time
i
stumbled
across
a
brewery
that
was
offering
a
hand
pumped
ale
and
always
ordered
it
this
beer
looks
great
its
smell
is
awesome
it
triggered
that
ahhhh
in
my
brain
that
said
yea
this
is
good
it
tastes
very
much
like
it
should
a
few
too
many
bubbles
but
when
i
let
it
warm
slightly
from
the
fridge
temp
there
were
less
bubbles
and
it
became
real
if
you
enjoy
the
style
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
i
have
had
colonel
blides
many
times
in
bottle
form
and
once
on
tap
at
the
brewery
it
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
by
cricket
hill
it
did
taste
slightly
off
in
the
growler
but
still
tasted
good
the
flavors
seemed
a
little
weaker
not
as
in
your
face
anyway
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
regardless
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
it
o
overall
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
from
a
nj
brewery
even
though
my
experience
at
the
cricket
hill
brewery
was
far
from
spectacular
i
still
think
a
lot
of
their
beers
are
solid
have
had
several
beer
from
this
brewery
and
this
one
sounded
like
it
would
be
pretty
tasty
the
pour
was
pretty
standard
for
me
with
a
some
decent
head
on
it
and
an
amber
colored
body
the
beer
wasnt
much
more
than
a
regular
english
bitter
the
flavor
is
on
the
dry
and
malty
side
not
much
hop
aromas
of
taste
coming
from
this
one
for
me
this
beer
was
just
average
and
not
much
more
just
another
english
bitter
started
to
pour
this
one
into
the
glass
it
became
quickly
obvious
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
voracious
pour
so
i
quickly
slowed
it
down
but
even
still
it
took
two
times
to
get
the
full
bottle
into
the
glass
a
huge
head
almost
immeasurable
in
size
formed
on
the
top
and
quickly
spilled
over
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
vigorous
and
lively
pour
here
the
color
was
bright
amber
yellow
somewhat
hazy
and
cloudy
but
very
light
and
bright
there
was
tons
of
carbonation
visible
throughout
the
entire
glass
which
really
kept
up
throughout
the
entire
session
nice
light
yeast
and
fruity
characters
coming
out
right
away
some
light
smells
of
peaches
bananas
light
cereal
grains
and
grasses
were
all
picked
up
right
away
very
bright
aroma
here
for
sure
really
a
nice
tight
profile
and
seemed
to
be
very
nice
a
touch
spicy
in
the
back
end
i
was
starting
to
pick
up
and
some
muted
hop
aromas
though
nothing
terribly
extreme
here
lots
of
light
cereal
grains
light
fruit
bananas
peach
a
hint
of
lemon
perhaps
all
mingling
in
together
and
giving
it
a
very
light
flavor
hints
of
grass
coming
through
now
along
with
a
slightly
muted
hop
profile
are
really
starting
to
make
this
one
pop
now
the
finish
was
crisp
clean
and
quick
straight
to
the
point
a
nice
sharp
cutoff
of
light
grassy
hops
gave
way
to
a
lingering
flavor
of
light
grain
super
light
bodied
and
very
highly
carbonated
would
be
the
best
way
to
describe
this
one
the
feel
was
extremely
light
classic
for
a
blond
ale
and
much
lighter
then
even
a
pale
ale
would
be
huge
carbonation
profile
really
helped
it
go
down
effortlessly
with
a
smooth
clean
and
crisp
finish
cloudy
orange
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
hops
taste
is
hops
and
light
frutiness
this
does
not
go
down
very
well
it
takes
a
hard
swallow
to
get
it
all
down
overall
a
pretty
unsavory
beer
that
was
not
the
least
bit
enjoyable
i
would
not
recommend
and
you
can
bet
this
is
my
last
one
ever
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
sessionable
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
this
was
a
decent
beer
good
balanced
flavor
and
very
easy
to
drink
would
make
a
great
session
beer
would
have
this
beer
again
d
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
cricket
hill
is
a
self
pronounced
gateway
brewery
into
the
craft
world
so
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
offering
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
way
they
hit
this
style
right
on
yeah
it
is
a
bit
deceiving
calling
is
a
cask
ale
and
using
co2
carbonation
but
the
nice
creamy
body
makes
up
for
it
i
will
look
for
more
offerings
from
cricket
hill
colonel
blide
looks
nice
nice
in
that
a
nice
bright
white
sudsy
head
stays
on
top
throughout
the
ride
sticking
is
minimal
but
its
there
if
you
look
for
it
for
a
english
bitter
this
is
much
darker
than
other
versions
id
say
a
bright
brown
with
gold
within
sets
the
mood
smell
is
quite
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
i
get
a
bunch
of
apple
slight
pear
with
caramel
in
small
spirts
a
nice
earthy
hop
background
keeps
it
together
i
never
experienced
a
bitter
with
such
a
fruity
component
and
im
liking
it
the
usual
bitter
characteristics
are
there
including
pale
maltmuted
bready
morning
food
and
a
touch
of
grain
the
fruit
is
a
added
bonus
and
apple
and
pear
are
up
there
with
some
others
following
the
feel
is
spactacular
and
smooth
with
a
minimal
bite
of
carbonation
thats
barely
noticable
a
medium
bodied
bitter
with
uummmpppphhh
i
really
liked
this
and
i
had
another
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
that
easy
to
find
i
never
saw
this
anywhere
in
the
philly
area
or
even
heard
of
it
thanks
scoats
for
bringing
this
one
to
my
attention
had
a
glass
at
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
pa
while
this
was
a
tasty
ale
i
was
disappointed
that
a
beer
with
cask
in
the
name
was
poured
with
co2
still
it
was
a
subtle
and
wellbalanced
beer
up
front
there
were
toasted
mildly
nutty
barley
which
were
then
backed
by
floral
herbal
citrus
hops
that
i
couldnt
quite
place
as
either
american
of
british
still
i
think
this
beer
would
fit
in
just
fine
at
an
english
pub
the
body
was
light
drinkable
and
true
to
style
i
really
enjoyed
and
hope
i
can
find
a
case
around
here
pours
a
really
nice
reddish
auburn
color
with
a
massive
off
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
has
a
slight
haze
to
it
really
pretty
aroma
is
very
creamy
and
has
a
orange
sorbet
undertone
also
has
a
bready
rye
component
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
fruity
dry
esters
of
fruit
come
through
with
a
bitterness
that
give
this
beer
a
nice
bite
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
cricket
hill
beers
next
to
their
jersey
summer
ale
really
nice
feel
with
great
carbonation
and
a
nice
clean
finish
drinkability
is
great
really
solid
session
able
beer
got
to
try
this
one
again
good
drink
cold
on
a
hot
day
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
in
my
visits
to
specialty
stores
serving
type
bottle
cricket
hills
hands
down
best
beer
disclaimer
never
had
it
by
the
bottle
first
sip
hit
with
a
slight
burst
of
hops
not
expected
but
good
the
hoppiness
evens
out
but
remains
on
my
tongue
a
malty
finish
on
the
end
a
good
drinkable
beer
nothing
extraordinary
but
good
would
enjoy
this
with
a
burger
or
other
types
of
pub
food
overall
an
ok
brew
pours
copper
with
small
tight
head
aroma
toasty
bready
flavor
is
toasty
maybe
a
little
biscuity
with
a
little
hop
whiff
and
a
mild
bitterness
a
little
banana
ester
disrupts
an
otherwise
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
satisfyingly
creamy
this
beer
isnt
deep
but
it
is
highly
drinkable
i
was
dubious
of
this
being
labeled
a
cask
ale
in
a
bottle
but
pleasantly
surprised
while
i
wouldnt
consider
it
a
cask
ale
by
any
stretch
it
is
a
fine
offering
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
nice
eng
bitter
i
wish
id
got
more
than
one
of
them
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
clear
copper
with
a
moderate
white
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
bready
faint
the
beer
is
very
balanced
bready
slightly
bitter
grapefruit
the
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
well
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
a
solid
esb
but
nothting
stands
out
this
beer
had
two
things
going
for
it
the
appearance
and
the
price
colonel
blides
had
a
solid
appearance
with
nothing
all
that
much
going
on
it
either
the
aroma
or
taste
its
a
good
thing
that
this
beer
is
pricey
or
moderately
priced
if
it
was
either
of
them
i
would
be
kicking
myself
right
now
as
of
right
now
you
can
more
than
likely
pick
up
a
bottle
for
less
than
2
but
more
than
1
50
boy
i
keep
finding
beers
from
jwc215
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
even
when
i
think
ive
drunk
them
all
i
think
this
was
the
last
one
though
and
not
a
bad
way
to
finish
up
this
one
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
34
inch
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
malt
and
tastes
of
malt
caramel
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
i
was
thinking
this
was
a
blonde
not
an
esb
but
i
like
it
either
way
not
really
bitter
but
a
damn
tasty
beer
carbonation
is
just
right
and
while
i
dont
remember
what
the
abv
is
i
wasnt
feeling
too
tipsy
a
nice
beer
very
drinkable
i
like
bitter
esbs
and
this
one
aint
half
bad
not
so
much
as
a
bad
beer
in
general
but
a
miss
as
an
esb
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
pale
and
light
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
and
some
light
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
grapefruit
bitterness
to
it
along
with
mostly
pale
malts
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
bit
too
much
co2
this
is
an
average
esb
it
not
a
bit
fan
of
hop
choice
chinook
also
the
malt
bill
doesnt
compliment
it
well
either
d
pretty
tasty
would
be
a
great
hopped
up
brew
to
session
with
747314
3
55
tastes
like
orange
juice
beer
over
and
over
again
and
again
no
real
hop
or
malt
character
at
all
many
bars
in
new
jersey
have
put
this
beer
on
their
draught
lines
under
their
house
name
like
cloverleaf
tavern
unfortunately
they
call
it
a
wide
range
of
styles
from
alt
to
red
none
of
which
is
accurate
pours
fairly
light
amber
good
head
and
solid
lacing
smells
of
a
little
malt
fruit
weak
nothing
about
this
beer
impressed
me
until
i
sipped
it
excellently
balanced
taste
cricket
hill
continues
to
impress
me
for
a
small
local
brewery
lots
of
citrus
notes
there
some
lemon
and
grapefruit
topped
with
a
hop
punch
akin
to
that
of
an
ipa
i
would
actually
almost
consider
this
an
ipa
finishes
hoppybitter
smooth
palate
with
a
light
ticklish
carbonation
unlike
other
tasters
i
didnt
find
this
beer
to
be
bland
at
all
very
complex
and
shocking
very
surprising
brew
thumbs
up
i
have
no
idea
what
the
alcoholic
content
of
this
is
but
this
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
i
only
found
this
being
sold
by
the
bottle
which
is
fine
for
those
nights
like
this
when
its
too
cold
outside
for
a
given
time
of
the
year
aficionados
of
cricket
hill
will
love
the
hint
of
their
hops
in
the
aftertaste
and
the
next
time
i
get
over
to
fairfield
ill
have
to
see
if
they
have
this
on
tap
there
something
tells
me
it
just
didnt
translate
into
the
bottle
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
bitter
with
some
citrus
the
taste
is
malty
bitter
slight
citrus
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
brew
d
all
in
all
not
a
bad
drink
would
venture
so
far
to
say
it
was
6pack
worthy
good
ease
of
consumption
23
with
a
moderately
decent
enjoyability
factor
if
you
get
the
chance
to
stop
in
its
certainly
worth
a
try
a
good
medium
mouthfeel
with
lightish
carbonation
it
finishes
with
more
fruit
a
slight
bitterness
and
some
earthy
tones
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
and
seems
to
grow
on
me
the
more
i
sip
give
it
a
shot
if
you
find
it
says
cask
ale
on
the
bottle
a
bit
confused
about
that
as
it
is
bottled
anyway
it
has
a
nice
enough
citric
balance
but
has
an
amateur
homebrewish
yeastiness
to
it
that
gives
it
almost
an
unfinished
touch
theis
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
body
it
is
so
thick
that
they
pour
half
let
it
settle
then
pour
the
rest
the
head
is
a
nice
thick
frothy
head
that
holds
throughout
the
beer
the
smell
was
slightly
malty
nothing
really
too
noticeable
the
taste
was
similar
their
was
slight
maltiness
there
but
otherwise
it
was
pretty
bland
there
was
really
nothing
to
balance
out
the
mouthfeel
was
fantastic
however
nice
soldi
and
thick
overall
not
too
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
makes
the
beer
inviting
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
bit
more
of
a
taste
to
it
cheers
last
swigs
a
fine
brew
for
the
style
nothing
that
i
would
seek
out
again

this
is
a
very
nice
brew
this
brew
is
a
dark
orange
colour
with
a
nice
khaki
head
of
foam
this
cask
was
served
via
sankey
but
it
was
still
quite
nice
the
aromas
were
of
fresh
bitter
hops
biscuity
malts
and
citrus
fruits
the
taste
was
fresh
and
floral
with
nice
citrusy
hops
in
the
mix
as
well
as
fresh
butter
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
cask
conditioned
and
awesome
and
the
drinkability
was
very
good
as
well
nice
stuff
this
an
absolutely
silky
creamy
smooth
brew
oh
do
i
love
cask
brews
the
body
was
pretty
full
and
the
flavor
was
right
there
floral
hops
to
bitter
a
bit
balanced
with
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
little
hints
of
citrus
here
and
there
although
my
two
glasses
appeared
very
different
the
flavoring
was
not
really
different
the
first
one
with
sediment
was
a
bit
more
earthy
but
it
really
did
not
stray
away
from
the
other
too
much
this
is
a
must
try
beer
if
you
are
from
jersey
you
have
to
realize
the
meaning
of
a
cask
ale
brewed
here
not
very
good
definitely
the
weakest
of
the
beer
camp
series
so
far
if
this
were
homebrew
i
would
give
it
away
to
nonparticular
friends
or
dump
it

its

kind

just

overall
an
ok
toasty
bitter
lacks

and
is
very
light
and
watery
nothing
special
will

it
in
no

pours
dark

hazy
with
a
short

that
faded
pretty
quickly
aroma
was
sweet
bready

with
some
slight

taste
was
pretty

lots

came

this

not

o
not

impressed
given
the

certainly
no

just
not
as
complex
as

i
found

a

for

nothing

well

for
a

that
could
appeal
to
the
masses
no
crazy
flavors
or

it
gets
the

done

behind
this
bitter
one
of
my
favorite
styles
no

its
an
underwhelming
offering
its
interesting
but
not
necessarily
very
pleasing
im
glad
to
have
tried
itand
went
back
for
seconds
to
clarify
my
impressionsbut
i
dont
believe
i
could
call
it
a
success
it
was
good
to
see
sierra
and
new
glarus
collaborate
on
this
traditional
style
of
beer
make
more
please
and
get
other
breweries
to
make
this
style
of
beer
every
once
in
a
while
too
overall
this
beer
is
drunk
on
the
day
of
our
stylequest
where
we
attempt
to
round
out
the
remaining
styles
we
need
to
rate
on
ba
weve
been
excited
to
sample
each
of
the
beer
camp
offerings
so
we
figured
that
here
we
could
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
there
and
back
served
both
of
these
purposes
nicely
this
is
an
expectedly
mild
beer
with
a
bit
more
sweetness
than
hoppiness
for
the
style
the
bitterness
of
it
tends
to
come
on
the
back
and
as
you
allow
for
each
sip
to
settle
we
found
this
to
be
a
refreshing
presentation
and
introduction
of
that
aspect
of
the
beer
rather
than
being
killed
off
the
top
with
forced
flavoring
the
malts
are
allowed
to
build
to
their
dark
biscuity
center
enough
to
cushion
the
bitterness
of
yeast
booze
and
toast
this
will
be
easy
to
enjoy
for
most
beer
lovers
o
very
impressed
with
this
one
lots
of
great
toasty
and
sweet
qualities
too
bad
this
was
only
brewed
once
this
would
be
a
goto
drinker
for
me
a
tasty
and
thirstquenching
beer
some
nice
simple
tastes
and
aromas
its
solid
and
easy
to
drink
since
its
a
oneoff
this
is
your
only
chance
to
try
it
so
id
say
its
worth
picking
up
if
you
run
across
it
youre
not
going
to
be
heartbroken
if
you
miss
out
on
it
though
o
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
esbs
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
i
dig
it
begins
with
an

on

it
pours

in
the
background
that
fades
into
a

there
and
backs
medium

it

the

just
swung

missed
so
much
iced

sweet

that
attempt
to
be
syrupy
but
not
quite
there
just
wasnt
really

had
this
on
tap
at
the
mellow

in
louisville
my
ninth
review
of
a
sierra
nevada
offering
call
me
old
fashioned
but
i
think
i
prefer
my
bitters
to
be
you
know
bitter
this
one
is
very
mild
and
the
fruitiness
wasnt
really
welcome
either
the
color
is
an
orangishamber
not
a
bad
look
its
all
right
just
not
my
favorite
bottle
from

not

easy

seems
on

but
a
style
that
doesnt
excite
me
that
much
one
of
the
better
in
the
style
for
me
though
o
nice
and
smooth
but
a
bit
too
fruity
and
bitter
for
my
english
bitter
preference
although
that
dissipates
towards
the
end
probably
due
to
warming
might
be
better
served
closer
to
the
english
standard
of
5560
rather
than
around
50
as
i
did
due
to
storing
it
in
a
beer
fridge
set
to
48
so
many
good
pieces
but
several
that
take
away
still
a
worthwhile
ale
overall
supreme
drinkability
and
a
well
crafted
example
of
the
style

edit
as
i
finish
this
im
detecting
more
nice
malty
flavor
with
a
slight
floral
element
to
the
hops
and
im
enjoying
enough
to
give
it
a
boost
in
flavor
points
d
this
was
my
least
favorite
of
the
pack
and
that
might
be
given
the
style
that
said
it
is
brewed
quite
well
and
has
a
great
drinkable
balance
just
a
bit
uninspired
for
me
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
malt
forward
flavors
create
a
sweet
presence
then
transitions
to
a
dry
and
crisp
finish
solid
esb
with
toasted
caramel
flavors
and
i
light
hoppy
backbone
balanced
with
a
drying
finish
milky
smooth
texture
dark
copper
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
head
bready
aroma
with
alcohol
line
sweet
fruity
malts
earth
flavor
with
underlying
herbal
notes
light
line
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
citrus
not
on
par
with
the
quaffable
british
bitters
another
mediocre
boring
beer
camp
offering
toasty
and
nutty
bitter
with
a
moderate
amount
of
hop
flavors
and
plenty
of
contribution
from
the
yeast
balanced
to
say
the
least
not
a
hype
brew
but
for
me
this
is
a
refreshing
bitter
to
drink
down
on
this
swampy
humid
day
o
not
especially
inspired
but
well
put
together
and
a
decent
effort
overall
a
good
beer
taste
sweet
toffee
with
a
bitter
cherry
bite
for
am
aftertaste
tastes
heavily
carbonated
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
really
im
a
bit
underwhelmed
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
pack
overall
i
note
that
a
number
of
reviewers
are
incorrectly
calling
this
an
esb
and
a
few
are
calling
it
an
english
pale
ale
i
think
the
problem
is
that
many
folks
are
unfamiliar
with
an
english
bitter
as
few
domestic
craft
brewers
tackle
the
style
and
those
that
do
tend
not
to
bottle
it
in
any
event
for
a
bottled
bitter
this
is
ok
though
it
lacks
some
of
the
earthy
bitterness
and
stone
fruit
flavor
to
really
nail
the
style
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
but
i
have
to
knock
off
points
because
i
feel
it
is
just
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
the
style
the
nose
is
bitter
earthy
hops
very
rustic
and
musty
with
a
little
citrus
zest
the
flavor
is
malt
pelts
grassy
and
bitter
hops
a
little
haystraw
note
very
grainy
this
is
a
bit
all
over
the
place
dancing
around
from
flavor
to
flavor
not
really
working
together
this
is
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
still
good
and
refreshing
but
could
be
better
this
esb
is
perfectly
inline
with
a
esb
i
am
not
sure
what
others
were
expecting
but
this
is
a
very
fine
almost
sessionable
ale
i
love
the
fruitiness
of
the
hops
with
the
strong
malt
backbone
its
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
fine
for
what
it
is
bottle
poured
a
light
copper
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
aroma
consists
of
fruity
ester
with
light
dry
bitter
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
dry
caramel
malt
notes
with
some
fruity
ester
body
is
about
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
enjoyable
as
a
onetime
beer
but
not
something
i
would
necessarily
seek
again
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
short
12
head
that
breaks
down
rather
quickly
fruity
characteristics
dominate
along
with
some
caramel
light
floral
bitterness
and
and
a
touch
of
breadiness
crisp
throughout
and
nicely
refreshing
when
you
are
looking
for
an
esb
with
some
nice
flavor
this
is
it
a
very
unremarkable
beer
not
much
to
smell
and
not
much
to
taste
fizzy
water
beer
not
a
bad
but
certainly
not
a
good
beer
so
far
i
think
i
want
to
call
my
parents
and
be
picked
up
from
beer
camp
early
o
as
someone
else
said
not
the
best
in
the
box
but
not
bad
it
didnt
overwhelm
me
overall
not
the
best
of
the
bunch
but
not
the
worst
either
no
wow
factor
gentle
hop
flavor
with
herbal
element
and
slight
caramel
flavor
from
the
malt
with
subtle
fruity
yeast
taste
with
hint
of
dry
toast
and
yet
creamy
flavor
from
malt
and
yeast
comingling
which
adds
a
light
smooth
yet
not
really
buttery
aspect
the
taste
is
greatwhat
you
expect
from
an
english
bittera
blend
of
hops
malt
and
yeast
i
am
finding
more
to
enjoy
as
it
warms
with
light
spice
and
slight
dark
sugar
in
the
back
with
mildly
bitter
herbal
hop
aspect
in
the
finish
overall
i
could
drink
this
every
day
enjoyable
actually
a
pretty
great
bitteresb
with
lots
of
dimension
my
second
favorite
in
the
case
so
far
splendid
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
easy
drinking
and
par
the
course
for
this
variety
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
body
with
fairly
lively
carbonation
at
first
which
quickly
died
off
and
a
fluffy
white
threefinger
head
that
slowly
receded
a
nice
looking
bitter
scents
of
sweetly
floral
hops
medium
levels
of
fruity
esters
reminiscent
of
apple
a
moderate
presence
of
caramel
a
lightly
earthy
herbal
hop
presence
in
the
background
a
touch
of
alcohol
faintly
discernible
and
light
presence
biscuity
malt
overall
impression
is
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
nice
balancing
touch
of
fruity
esters
and
hop
aromas
very
pleasing
and
quite
balanced
flavor
begins
malty
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
and
slight
toasted
and
nutty
malts
balanced
by
a
nice
moderate
level
of
hop
bitterness
with
an
herbal
and
lightly
citrusy
character
this
moves
into
a
moderately
bitter
middle
with
notes
of
herbal
and
floral
hop
flavors
and
a
mediumlight
level
of
fruity
esters
with
a
balancing
pale
and
nutty
malt
backbone
finish
is
dry
with
notes
of
toasted
and
nutty
malt
herbal
earthy
and
zesty
citrus
fruit
hops
and
a
light
presence
of
fruity
esters
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
aftertaste
is
dry
with
notes
of
resinous
hops
toasted
and
nutty
malts
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
feeling
with
low
carbonation
adding
to
this
impression
overall
this
is
a
good
english
bitter
it
balances
sweet
nutty
and
toasted
malt
flavors
with
a
nice
level
of
hop
character
and
bitterness
to
create
a
moderately
bitter
yet
still
balanced
impression
on
the
drinker
its
aroma
is
similarly
balanced
and
the
mouthfeel
adds
to
impression
of
a
balanced
quaffable
session
ale
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
of
the
best
of
the
beer
camp
series
but
then
the
beer
warmed
up
and
a
whole
bunch
of
neatness
began
to
shine
through
maybe
thats
the
whole
english
thingsince
they
drink
this
warm
we
should
too
the
back
end
began
miraculously
to
take
on
strong
nodes
of
sierra
nevada
yeastiness
the
combination
of
somewhat
rougher
american
nodes
livened
up
the
beer
considerably
the
bitter
is
a
dying
style
in
the
states
but
brews
like
this
proves
that
doesnt
necessarily
have
to
be
the
case
this
is
very
tasty
and
worth
revisiting
new
glarus
and
sn
know
beer
so
when
they
say
this
is
nutty
they
arent
joking
i
catch
not
only
a
nutty
malt
but
pecans
and
almonds
there
is
a
light
hop
bitterness
and
some
pine
but
the
nutty
malt
flavors
are
more
pervasive
this
is
very
highly
carbonated
and
has
some
harsh
tendencies
along
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
this
is
a
very
nice
entry
in
the
beer
camp
12
pack
overall
just
a
bland
english
pale
ale
very
muted
malt
flavor
i
did
enjoy
the
light
bitter
aftertaste
but
it
needed
way
more
body
a
well
done
english
bitter
easy
drinking
light
hops
with
a
solid
but
unobtrusive
malt
backbone
overall
a
good
beer
that
was
nice
and
malty
with
just
enough
hop
zest
to
add
to
the
flavor
im
not
well
versed
in
this
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
have
to
check
out
more
english
bitters
really
great
collaboration
as
part
of
the
beer
camp
offerings
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
one
so
far
and
i
have
had
about
half
of
them
an
excellent
summer
beer
crisp
refreshing
very
nice
o
this
is
such
a
wellbalanced
flavorful
and
smooth
english
ale
this
one
caught
me
by
surprise
quite
a
treat
o
this
is
very
nice
reminds
me
of
a
civilized
gentle
bitter
quaff
overall
a
decent
bitter
overall
but
really
nothing
all
that
fantastic
o
a
good
beer
overall
simple
but
tasty
crisp
and
refreshing
poured
into
a
sierra
nevada
pint
glass
with
a
slight
white
head
light
anger
color
with
a
steady
amount
of
light
bobbles
malty
toasty
smell
with
a
slight
fruity
taste
slight
toasty
taste
with
a
good
malt
backbone
and
a
slight
amount
of
hops
has
a
slight
bitter
taste
and
has
that
english
tent
slight
carbonation
but
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
pretty
good
beer
havent
had
many
english
bitters
but
i
do
like
this
one
turbid
copper
colored
body
with
a
white
head
toasty
malt
nutty
and
caramel
aromas
malty
flavors
with
dry
fruity
hop
finish
tasty
overall
the
fruitiness
is
odd
for
the
style
but
everything
else
is
pretty
good
o
this
beer
reminded
me
of
many
other
new
glarus
brews
you
can
tell
they
are
experts
at
picking
out
and
mixing
the
finest
imported
malts
that
being
said
this
collaboration
falls
short
of
other
malty
new
glarus
ales
like
fat
squirrel
my
wife
and
i
had
great
hope
for
this
beer
we
previously
lived
in
wisconsin
and
while
we
were
happy
enough
with
it
it
made
us
wish
for
the
real
deal
overall
a
decent
bitter
better
than
most
i
really
like
this
example
of
a
bitter
very
drinkable
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
ive
never
had
anything
from
new
glarus
even
though
this
is
a
collaboration
worth
a
shot
o
not
very
pumped
on
this
one
a
very
social
beeri
could
have
a
few
of
these
served
in
a
mug
o
a
solid
and
easily
drinkable
englishstyle
bitter
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
pretty
standard
fare
for
an
englishstyle
brew
d
a
very
decent
representation
of
a
style
that
i
wish
more
american
brewers
would
tackle
quite
quaffable
goes
down
easily
sip
after
sip
good
complexity
and
quite
enjoyable
im
still
early
on
on
my
exploration
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
offerings
but
this
one
is
one
of
my
favorites
thus
far
overall
really
nice
flavors
easy
drinking
but
wonderfully
flavorful
o
easy
to
drink
and
almost
sessionable
just
a
hint
too
much
alcohol
for
it
to
be
a
truly
sessionable
beer
very
nice
flavor
the
body
is
smooth
full
and
even
with
a
nicely
dry
finish
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
see
knocking
off
a
sixer
on
a
summers
afternoon
with
no
problem
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
and
one
of
the
ones
from
this
box
that
id
like
to
see
as
a
stand
alone
brew
o
im
not
going
to
lie
given
new
glarus
pedigree
i
had
hoped
that
the
collaboration
brew
would
be
fruit
based
that
said
this
bitter
is
a
pretty
decent
no
frills
example
of
the
style
its
a
onetwo
punch
of
toasted
malt
and
herbal
hops
not
the
most
polished
and
smooth
bitter
on
the
block
but
not
bad
you
dont
always
have
to
shoot
for
the
moon
with
collaboration
beers
overall
i
must
admit
that
my
experience
with
this
style
is
very
limited
this
is
the
first
ive
reviewed
on
ba
but
ive
had
a
couple
in
the
past
and
while
there
and
back
seems
to
touch
all
the
bases
for
the
style
i
feel
like
the
fruitiness
could
come
out
a
bit
more
and
the
bitterness
could
be
a
lot
more
assertive
in
spite
of
having
a
favorable
appearance
and
mouthfeel
that
seems
to
style

and

noticing
a

what

their

have
in

also
notice

quite
delicious
beautiful
cascading
on
the
pour
belhaven
best
is
undoubtedly
belhavens
worst
what
can
i
say
i
guess
you
gotta
make
money
somehow
and
for
reasons
that
ill
never
understand
the
majority
of
beer
drinkers
prefer
something
insipid
predictable
and
undistinguished
i
cant
blame
the
marketing
department
for
being
unable
to
passup
the
the
cream
of
scottish
beer
tagline
but
i
certainly
dont
have
to
support
it
nevermind
a
repeat
purchase
this
is
a
beer
i
wish
i
never
bought
in
the
first
place
for
the
fourplus
years
we
lived
in
scotland
belhaven
best
was
the
beer
on
which
i
always
fell
back
it
was
so
creamy
and
smooth
with
taste
that
i
esteemed
it
the
best
i
also
like
really
hearty
beers
of
which
belhaven
best
is
not
but
for
everyday
drinking
especially
with
meals
i
loved
belhaven
best
its
like
the
irish
guinness
when
poured
in
a
glass
lots
of
gas
that
needs
to
settle
out
whats
left
is
a
great
smooth
tasty
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
to
me
a
bit
of
a
cross
with
english
pale
ales
while
decent
theres
nothing
spectacular
about
this
either
worth
a
try
clear
light
amber
in
colour
with
a
thick
rich
creamy
staying
head
faint
hop
aroma
taste
is
very
light
subtle
and
creamy
a
delicious
balance
of
soft
malts
carrying
faint
notes
of
nut
and
caramel
faintly
carbonated
and
mouthfeel
is
very
round
and
smooth
a
very
delicate
yet
fullflavoured
beer
smell
of
sweet
malts
maybe
some
wheat
beer
aromas
no
real
discernable
hops
taste
is
thin
with
no
one
flavor
jumping
out
i
dont
want
to
say
bland
just
not
alot
going
on
average
taste
and
flavor
thin
body
and
mouthfeel
a
drinkable
sessional
because
it
wont
overpower
your
taste
buds
or
fill
you
up
not
sure
about
it
being
the
best
at
only
about
2
a
tall
can
this
is
a
decent
bitter
with
the
creamy
mouthfeel
of
a
nitro
can
the
beer
is
certainly
not
too
complex
but
i
enjoyed
the
toffee
notes
and
the
smooth
finish
as
fall
approaches
this
is
the
kind
of
easy
drinking
beer
that
replaces
the
wheat
and
light
lagers
from
the
summer
i
prefer
the
courage
directors
ale
in
cans
for
the
same
price
but
i
will
buy
some
more
of
this
brew
overall
decent
but
not
somethign
id
seek
out
o
a
decent
bitter
obviously
much
better
on
tap
final
grade
3
35
an
acceptable
b
minus
grade
good
stuff
and
as
a
bonus
for
any
frugal
uk
ale
fans
its
quite
cheap
in
these
parts
as
well
hopefully
the
lcbo
keeps
bringing
in
belhavens
best
because
its
easily
the
best
nitro
beer
ive
picked
up
from
there
in
years
simple
yet
solid
worth
a
try
but
not
something
to
move
mountains
in
search
of
i
was
a
bit
surprised
with
the
nitro
can
im
used
to
nitro
widgets
only
being
in
guinness
anyways
this
bitter
pours
out
an
amber
colour
with
a
thick
white
creamy
head
it
goes
downhill
from
there
the
smell
has
some
light
butterscotch
grassy
hops
tea
like
aroma
honey
and
an
odd
smell
that
i
cant
quite
described
something
kind
of
gassy
tastes
sweet
with
toffee
and
malts
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
some
grassy
and
citrus
hops
cleans
the
palate
afterwards
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
overall
a
rather
disappointing
english
style
bitter
doesnt
make
that
great
of
an
impression
i
would
imagine
this
is
the
type
of
light
mediocre
domestic
fare
that
folks
in
the
u
k
chug
down
without
thinking
twice
about
glad
i
managed
to
just
pick
up
a
single
of
this
stuff
final
thoughts
i
touched
base
on
it
on
the
mouthfeel
but
i
honestly
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
beer
without
the
nitro
i
will
say
this
though
this
is
probably
the
first
beer
ive
had
where
i
actually
wanted
to
see
a
bit
more
bitterness
involved
still
id
recommend
it
regardless
but
that
being
said
i
cant
stand
ipas
so
take
from
that
what
you
will
d
easy
drinking
moderately
flavoured
brew
a
true
sessioner
pale
amber
orange
colour
nearly
2
fingers
of
dense
white
head
some
lace
left
behind
smell
is
biscuity
malt
and
caramel
graham
crackers
faint
traces
of
honey
and
at
points
some
floral
notes
taste
is
pretty
biscuity
and
malty
oddly
metallic
light
fruity
and
floral
points
in
aftertaste
light
underlying
bitterness
throughout
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fairly
watery
though
the
medium
body
makes
this
fairly
creamy
on
the
tongue
minimal
carbonation
this
was
juts
ok
nothing
overly
interesting
and
if
that
metallic
taste
wasnt
there
that
would
help
its
case
quite
a
bit
i
little
on
the
fizzy
side
like
most
keg
bitters
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
the
only
noncask
ale
i
had
during
the
crawl
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
has
just
enough
flavour
to
keep
it
interesting
and
sessionable
the
appearance
is
fantastic
in
the
glass
and
it
was
priced
fairly
reasonably
id
buy
it
again

com
d
to
be
blunt
the
beauty
of
a
nitrocan
cant
make
up
for
the
blandness
if
you
need
something
lightflavoured
and
easyaswater
to
drink
its
a
fine
choice
but
otherwise
not
really
worthwhile
and
not
much
of
a
bitter
at
all
if
canned
pub
ales
what
your
after
i
wouldnt
put
this
at
the
top
of
my
list
but
nor
would
it
be
near
the
bottom
it
tastes
fine
inoffensive
and
the
low
abv
is
a
plus
if
sessionings
the
thing
its
cheap
in
ontario
so
i
might
get
it
again
a
lovely
beer
in
the
tactile
sense
this
goes
down
so
smoothly
the
nitro
puck
really
doing
its
thing
however
for
a
bitter
there
just
isnt
enough
well
bitterness
and
thats
not
doing
its
thing
as
enjoyable
as
this
seems
to
be
and
even
with
the
sensespreserving
abv
this
fundamental
lack
would
prove
tiring
and
somewhat
cloying
whilst
considering
a
nights
iterative
rounds
it
certainly
isnt
bad
but
just
not
as
smooth
going
as
i
remember
the
smoky
notes
in
the
taste
and
sourness
in
the
finish
are
a
bit
offputting
for
my
current
palate
but
it
goes
down
quite
easy
after
a
pint
or
two
this
beer
poured
out
has
a
nice
looking
deep
copper
color
the
head
was
creamy
looking
and
white
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
malty
and
has
some
nice
sweet
grainy
aromas
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
subtle
sweetness
upfront
that
fades
into
a
dry
bitterness
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
remains
creamy
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
i
like
most
of
what
ive
had
from
belhaven
thus
far
not
a
bad
brew
to
try
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
very
high
i
could
totally
sit
in
a
pub
and
down
several
pints
of
this
i
might
even
buy
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
light
beer
with
some
flavour
o
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
better
on
cask
starting
out
less
than
terrible
but
as
the
head
got
consumed
quality
plummeted
not
bad
enough
to
pour
out
but
i
wont
be
having
any
more
belhaven
from
a
can
stuff
like
this
is
why
people
think
they
dont
like
beer
needless
to
say
not
recommended
pours
a
nice
mid
copper
with
awesome
head
and
lacing
nice
scent
with
good
malts
and
a
nice
light
earthy
bitterness
good
flavor
with
good
malt
backing
a
slight
toffeeness
underneath
and
good
earthy
hop
aftertaste
extremely
smooth
almost
cask
like
good
stuff
it
is
pretty
popular
here
in
scotland
although
south
of
the
border
i
am
not
too
sure
but
i
find
it
unlikely
to
be
so
widespread
d
easy
to
down
a
few
of
these
over
a
meal
and
not
bat
an
eye
too
weak
for
my
taste
there
are
other
better
bitters
move
along
i
had
this
on
tap
assuming
it
was
nitro
at
twisted
kilt
in
toronto
pours
a
copper
orange
colour
with
a
finger
or
2
of
creamy
white
head
head
doesnt
dissipate
at
all
with
some
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smells
very
mild
some
floral
hops
and
biscuit
malt
flavour
is
just
mild
bitterness
a
bit
of
sweetness
creamy
mouthfeel
im
pretty
sure
this
is
on
nitro
an
ok
beer
nothing
too
great
though
not
a
bad
beer
it
would
be
good
with
standard
pub
fare
this
scottish
ale
was
poured
from
a
nitro
can
and
the
appearance
was
darker
than
a
boddington
but
a
tad
lighter
than
a
kilkenny
taste
was
a
mild
bitter
not
at
all
displeasing
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
as
are
most
nitros
i
only
had
one
but
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
doesnt
look
horrendous
but
that
uniform
foamy
head
was
a
sign
of
things
to
come
almost
devoid
of
odour
this
tasted
slightly
tinny
at
best
body
was
fat
and
bloated
letting
very
little
resembling
flavour
escape
like
an
over
inflated
tire
about
to
burst
to
be
honest
considering
the
brewing
legacy
here
this
is
not
a
beer
which
inhances
belhavens
reputation
excellent
honey
in
color
but
with
thin
offwhite
head
lingering
for
a
long
time
sweet
bready
malts
in
aroma
smooth
caramel
almost
neutral
slight
hop
ensues
dry
and
strict
in
character
ale
i
would
spend
my
money
on
something
else
more
spectacular
overall
id
say
this
beer
like
nearly
all
beers
has
its
time
and
its
place
its
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
and
i
think
its
been
amped
up
a
bit
since
it
was
first
put
into
this
system
jumping
a
percent
higher
in
abv
pints
of
this
can
easily
be
crushed
but
on
most
days
i
still
prefer
a
full
flavoured
savoury
beer
over
a
quaffer
frothing
froth
quaffer
like
this
mfd
easily
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
as
there
is
not
much
flavor
almost
flat
but
very
light
would
be
the
obvious
conclusion
overall
still
a
drinkable
beer
tasting
notes
october
2009
suits
my
taste
for
a
lowhopped
ale
though
i
actually
prefer
belhavens
scottish
ale
but
its
not
so
easy
to
get
in
pubs
not
nearly
so
attractive
in
cans
even
with
the
little
nitro
bomb
inside
fairly
average
bitter
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
not
a
bad
bitter
just
a
bit
boring
the
nitro
does
not
help
in
that
regard
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
cask
but
as
is
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
totally
drinkable
decent
brew
for
the
style
is
ontap
bitter
even
a
style
anyway
does
the
trick
on
a
nice
glaswegian
sunday
afternoon
for
4
99
with
a
sunday
roast
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tasted
from
scotland
brownish
in
colour
with
dominant
burntcaramel
notes
both
on
the
nose
and
taste
probably
due
to
the
pasteurisation
regime
in
goes
through
very
drinkable
especially
in
the
wetcold
scottish
atmosphere
i
would
drink
this
if
there
was
nothing
else
on
offer
but
it
is
no
better
than
any
other
manufactured
beer
out
there
especially
with
the
number
in
scotland
if
you
are
desperate
for
manufactured
beer
then
mcewans
export
or
tennents
special
are
both
in
my
opinion
better
alternatives
this
lacks
any
real
taste
not
sure
where
best
came
from
they
should
be
sued
for
misleading
information
note
i
actually
cant
remember
whether
this
was
keg
or
cask
so
im
guessing
keg
its
definitely
a
mass
market
brew
but
tastes
good
enough
to
do
in
a
pinch
my
marks
might
be
adjusted
downward
to
account
for
the
fact
that
it
was
1
on
the
golf
course
and
2
free
very
nice
weak
watery
body
on
this
one
ruined
what
could
have
been
a
decent
session
bitter
just
too
weak
for
me
2
or
3
of
this
diluted
concoction
and
you
feel
waterlogged
on
tap
in
a
pub
somewhers
in
ketih
scotland
this
is
on
nitro
i
think
after
the
cascadeing
effect
has
finished
its
a
nice
enough
looking
pint
brown
with
hints
of
garnet
lovelly
tan
creamy
head
not
much
aroma
to
this
but
it
doesnt
stink
nice
actually
carameltoffeeish
hints
in
the
flavours
malts
are
slightly
roasty
nice
on
the
palate
very
smooth
overall
drinkable
yet
uninspiring
this
seems
to
be
taking
over
in
my
old
neck
of
the
woods
ne
scotland
upgraded
rating
based
on
1
5
years
later
on
tap
at
abbot
on
the
hill
but
still
poor
d
drinkable
for
the
style
although
i
cant
find
anything
make
me
feel
this
ale
is
moreish
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
a
glass
of
this
again
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
good
body
and
superb
nitrocarbonation
make
this
tasty
brew
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
i
was
very
suprised
by
this
one
had
never
heard
of
nor
tried
it
before
i
recommend
it
and
will
drink
it
again
in
the
future
cheers
it
was
an
average
english
boitter
but
to
me
that
is
more
than
adequate
an
obviously
quaffable
beer
but
not
one
i
would
actively
seek
out
i
had
this
one
at
the
castle
on
king
in
kitchener
on
the
pint
was
a
clear
amber
colour
with
a
dense
cream
coloured
head
from
the
nitro
tap
head
retention
was
great
and
it
left
lacing
down
the
entire
glass
aromas
were
very
mild
with
some
fruity
esters
subdued
hops
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
same
in
the
flavour
department
with
malt
and
hops
lingering
for
a
short
time
in
the
finish
low
carbonation
with
a
light
body
and
great
balance
a
great
session
beer
overall
impression
not
bad
interesting
to
try
something
different
but
i
wont
be
seeking
these
out
again
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
nonoffending
to
the
taste
buds
but
it
is
just
a
nice
mild
beer
that
isnt
particularly
outstanding
great
looking
shitty
tasting
the
beer
had
so
much
potential
and
then
it
just
failed
to
impress
it
started
out
nice
with
a
beautiful
nitro
pour
with
a
densly
packed
white
head
and
a
nice
clear
carmel
color
the
smell
was
not
good
at
all
with
a
prevailing
sourness
that
turned
me
off
from
the
get
go
the
taste
was
not
one
that
i
would
care
to
experience
again
with
its
overly
woodyraw
hamburger
meat
aftertaste
not
recommended
at
all
pours
a
pale
copper
color
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
subtle
aromas
of
sweet
earthy
malt
light
hops
and
an
undercurrent
of
fruitiness
theres
a
slight
sweet
tealike
malt
twang
to
it
a
bit
of
buttery
diacetyl
and
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
round
it
out
overall
its
rather
weak
but
its
to
be
expected
its
a
little
too
balanced
towards
the
sweet
side
and
the
metalliclike
taste
that
shows
up
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
really
takes
away
from
what
could
be
a
good
bitter
this
isnt
belhavens
best
down
right
terrible
perhaps
it
was
a
very
old
4
pack
of
nitros
but
this
was
unbearable
poured
out
a
an
amberbrownish
color
with
a
huge
head
from
the
nitro
can
the
head
never
really
did
setlle
down
smell
consisted
of
malts
caramel
and
toasted
aromas
it
was
on
the
sweet
side
mostly
taste
was
almost
the
same
very
sweet
and
some
metallic
notes
could
be
detected
as
well
just
very
unpleasent
and
avoid
this
brew
at
all
costs
14
9
ounce
nitro
can
oddly
enough
it
made
no
mention
of
the
widget
on
the
can
1
60
a
can
at
asheville
wine
market
you
know
a
beer
is
gonna
be
rated
poorly
when
its
best
feature
is
its
head
and
carbonation
the
widget
does
an
amazing
job
here
if
you
like
long
lasting
creamy
super
fine
bubble
head
and
amazing
creamy
lacing
otherwise
this
was
a
stinker
minimal
flavor
no
hops
metalic
tastes
etc
etc
back
to
the
drawing
board
for
this
one
another
perfect
nitrogencorrupted
head
on
this
beer
somehow
the
texture
of
nitro
beers
really
detracts
from
the
brews
other
characteristics
below
the
head
is
a
tawny
colored
liquid
aroma
of
caramel
maltintensely
so
i
really
liked
caramelized
sweetness
of
the
smellunderpinnings
of
fruitiness
and
maybe
a
tad
diacetyl
but
pleasingly
so
i
think
that
the
nitrotexture
gets
in
the
way
when
looking
for
the
slickness
mild
hopiness
moderate
to
highsweetness
the
hops
dont
do
a
good
job
balancing
the
sweetness
and
by
the
end
of
the
brew
it
becomes
a
little
cloying
worth
a
trymaybe
even
two
or
more
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
find
really
nice
looking
beer
with
a
thick
super
creamy
head
that
lasts
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
with
lacing
all
the
way
down
mild
nutty
slightly
smokey
smell
nice
and
mild
malts
nuttyness
with
a
liottle
bit
of
that
smoke
in
there
real
mild
hops
that
arent
very
distinctive
but
present
mouthfeel
is
the
very
thinner
side
of
medium
but
well
suited
i
think
the
drinkability
here
is
very
high
it
looks
great
has
a
good
taste
and
is
low
on
the
alcohol
i
feel
like
i
could
put
6
of
these
away
and
not
even
notice
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
power
behing
the
taste
though
it
looked
great
as
it
poured
and
settled
the
taste
is
similar
to
belhavens
scottish
ale
but
much
more
creamy
all
the
flavors
are
somewhat
muted
but
for
some
reason
this
works
very
well
there
is
a
toasted
flavor
upfront
and
a
bitterness
in
the
afteraftertaste
this
beer
is
oh
so
smooth
and
one
i
can
see
myself
returning
to
i
knew
this
was
a
low
abv
so
my
review
reflects
that
typical
nice
nitro
head
and
decent
caramel
color
smell
was
lightly
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
smoky
quality
taste
was
smoky
in
a
nice
mild
way
a
definite
session
brew
mouthfeel
as
expected
was
light
but
pleasing
enough
extremely
easy
to
drink
kind
of
like
a
light
beer
but
with
a
lot
more
flavor
good
for
what
it
is
a
low
abv
session
beer
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
nitrocan
it
gives
the
beer
an
amazing
head
and
is
a
cool
looking
shade
of
blue
everything
else
about
it
is
disappointing
the
most
disappointing
thing
it
only
contains
3
9
alcohol
thats
incredible
i
didnt
notice
that
until
i
already
had
poured
it
and
when
i
tasted
it
i
couldnt
deny
the
beers
weakness
after
the
creamy
head
was
a
wierd
yellow
beer
that
had
almost
no
taste
it
didnt
taste
bad
and
it
didnt
taste
good
it
simply
had
no
flavor
not
surprising
when
you
consider
that
it
is
weaker
than
mic
ultra
the
tapwater
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
for
free
do
so
just
so
you
can
tell
everyone
about
the
weakest
beer
ever
pours
a
light
amber
for
such
little
head
it
has
a
nice
bit
of
lace
to
go
w
it
not
to
much
of
a
smell
to
it
it
has
a
light
semisweet
flavor
it
it
has
a
hint
of
smoke
mixed
with
the
malty
dry
finish
but
definately
not
crisp
more
of
a
nice
creamy
feel
blanaced
through
and
through
easy
drinking
through
and
through
nice
easy
going
beer
pop
the
top
and
let
the
nitro
can
do
its
thing
this
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
after
some
separation
and
leaves
behind
a
nice
thick
creamy
white
head
that
keeps
its
form
smells
of
malts
and
the
taste
could
be
described
as
very
subtle
some
may
even
consider
this
brew
as
being
watery
once
you
can
get
by
this
you
notice
a
very
nicely
balance
beer
that
has
a
nice
maltysmokeyness
to
it
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
i
would
not
pass
it
by
if
it
was
offered
to
me
another
sad
example
of
how
not
to
package
a
great
beer
the
usual
presentation
for
the
nitro
pop
the
tab
dump
into
the
glass
after
the
bubbles
do
their
trick
an
amber
color
beverage
appears
first
sip
watered
down
i
hate
writing
this
review
because
you
sense
this
is
a
great
beer
that
has
been
destroyed
by
the
widget
a
little
hops
but
i
could
not
get
by
the
watered
down
taste
even
my
wife
commented
this
would
be
a
good
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
tragedy
flavor
is
creamy
and
malty
with
a
nice
nutty
finish
reminds
me
of
that
same
aftertaste
you
get
when
you
eat
hazelnuts
no
apparent
metallic
taste
light
earthy
herbal
hops
blending
seamlessly
with
the
malt
balance
like
whoa
i
cant
tell
where
the
malts
begin
and
the
hops
end
awesome
damn
fine
beer
even
in
the
can
id
love
to
try
this
on
tap
or
cask
a
staple
on
my
recent
scotland
trip
it
has
a
black
or
brown
plastic
bubble
tap
sign
the
extra
cold
version
of
the
same
beer
has
a
blue
bubble
tap
sign
medium
copper
color
orange
looking
at
times
rust
or
brown
at
times
depending
on
the
light
bubbly
thin
tan
head
toasted
smells
seem
to
dominate
taste
was
smooth
and
sufficiently
bitter
nice
hop
presence
always
a
somewhat
metallic
taste
to
finish
hard
water
not
sure
but
it
happened
more
than
once
nice
nitro
creaminess
to
it
but
it
seemed
to
get
a
little
watery
at
times
overall
an
easy
to
find
pleasing
experience
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
big
frothy
cascading
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lace
the
mild
sweet
malty
aroma
and
faint
hop
smell
fades
fast
so
enjoy
it
while
you
can
notes
of
caramel
blend
with
tealike
hops
a
trace
of
metallic
bitterness
can
be
detected
with
some
effort
i
dont
know
how
they
do
it
but
this
ale
is
a
pretty
fair
forgery
of
a
scottish
mild
on
tap
this
is
the
first
belhaven
product
ive
tried
on
balance
although
ive
been
pleased
with
several
of
the
imported
ales
available
in
nitro
cans
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
it
poured
out
a
nice
brown
color
but
unusual
for
a
product
in
a
nitro
can
had
a
very
weaklooking
head
the
smell
and
taste
seemed
lighter
than
i
would
have
expected
for
a
best
very
little
hop
flavor
more
like
a
summer
ale
certainly
a
drinkable
product
but
i
find
it
hard
in
this
case
to
justify
paying
the
premium
import
price
being
charged
for
a
4pack
if
this
is
the
best
stuff
they
got
id
hate
to
see
the
worst
just
kidding
this
stuff
is
awesome
its
appearance
isnt
that
bad
but
i
usually
do
like
darker
beers
it
did
have
a
cool
seperation
effect
though
the
head
stuck
around
forever
too
so
i
liked
that
the
taste
was
a
very
nice
creamy
taste
somewhat
similar
to
the
wexford
but
a
little
bit
deeper
in
taste
the
finish
was
definately
smooth
and
didnt
leave
a
nasty
aftertaste
like
most
light
beers
excellent
beer
on
a
hot
summers
day
very
thirst
quenching
could
be
better
though
i
dont
want
to
write
this
one
off
as
allaround
bad
its
smooth
thirst
quenching
sessionable
at
times
the
bitter
quality
tastes
a
little
too
much
like
rocks
but
on
the
bright
side
there
is
a
respectable
malt
presence
accompanied
by
a
light
fruity
quality
in
the
taste
to
round
things
out
final
thoughts
i
got
this
in
a
pack
for
christmas
from
my
brother
and
sadly
the
best
brew
out
of
that
pack
was
wychwoods
flagship
beer
hobgoblin
this
beer
has
put
me
in
the
position
of
not
wanting
to
try
any
more
wychwood
products
save
for
maybe
king
goblin
since
i
would
hope
it
would
be
similar
to
hobgoblin
apart
from
hobgoblin
and
fiddlers
elbow
ive
been
very
disappointed
with
this
brewery
as
of
late
this
stuff
is
average
at
best
and
you
will
want
to
pass
overall
a
pretty
boring
english
bitter
there
are
some
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
but
there
really
isnt
that
much
there
i
wouldnt
mind
it
as
a
sessional
id
particularly
like
to
try
it
on
tap
however
the
price
in
australia
is
as
usual
prohibitive
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
i
like
the
sweet
malts
but
could
use
just
a
little
something
i
suppose
its
a
session
beer
and
as
such
its
decent
cool
new
beer
as
part
of
the
wychwood
4
pack
the
bottle
is
brown
not
clear
like
the
thumbnail
above
thank
god
i
like
the
fact
it
is
4
2
abv
thought
the
name
suggests
a
bigger
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
autumnal
gold
with
a
slight
nose
the
taste
is
nutty
and
quite
dry
on
the
finish
not
a
lot
of
complexity
unlike
scarecrow
or
wychcraft
the
beer
is
certainly
very
drinkable
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
i
did
like
the
finish
which
was
rounded
yet
autstere
at
the
same
time
pretty
good
offering
but
not
my
fave
wychwood
beer
overall
a
lackluster
beer
that
definitely
doesnt
live
up
to
its
name
o
a
pretty
sound
bitter
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
drink
it
again
on
a
warm
day
overall
not
at
all
special
just
some
basic
english
beer
not
for
your
craft
beer
lovers
or
for
any
of
the
guys
who
like
belgian
beers
strictly
english
amberorange
body
offwhite
head
retains
poorly
but
leaves
a
few
rings
of
lace
light
toasted
bread
and
floral
aromas
flavour
shows
notes
of
lightly
toasted
bread
faint
whispers
of
sour
apple
and
a
lingering
earthy
bitterness
this
is
pretty
meek
stuff
slight
metallic
quality
feels
thin
and
watery
with
low
carbonation
bland
and
boring
it
ends
with
alot
of
flavor
a
little
watery
on
the
end
despite
big
chewiness
in
the
middle
a
big
beer
without
the
big
booze
not
a
letdown
and
the
booze
and
that
little
rambling
now
i
really
enjoy
most
wychwood
beers
although
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
most
likely
my
least
liked
of
the
wychwood
beers
that
i
have
tried
it
seemed
to
lack
complexity
was
somewhat
light
with
far
less
mouthfeel
and
head
retention
then
most
other
wychwood
beers
im
a
big
fan
of
wychwoods
beers
especially
hobgoblin
so
when
ever
i
see
another
wychwood
beer
at
my
commision
i
am
always
anxious
to
give
it
a
try
but
goliath
was
dwarfed
in
comparrison
to
hobgoblin
i
pourd
it
into
my
hobgoblin
glass
and
the
colour
was
a
nice
orange
brown
colour
and
very
clear
the
head
was
about
one
finger
in
size
and
lingered
on
for
the
most
part
of
the
beers
consumption
but
whithered
away
by
the
end
of
the
beer
it
tasted
very
light
and
watery
kind
of
bitter
though
near
the
end
all
and
all
it
did
what
it
said
on
the
bottle
it
slayed
my
thirst
and
it
wasnt
unpleasent
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
and
not
feet
too
lousy
on
the
other
hand
i
am
not
all
that
impressed
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
is
much
better
from
wychwood
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
brilliant
retention
and
thickness
to
the
head
and
fantastic
lace
great
look
nose
is
bready
some
earth
notes
and
a
hint
of
grass
light
hop
notes
and
some
sweetness
although
something
feels
a
bit
off
here
touch
of
skunkiness
taste
has
english
malts
bread
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
lightly
earthy
and
some
sweetness
as
per
the
nose
medium
light
feel
slick
carbonation
and
some
residual
hops
and
malt
sweetness
after
each
sip
a
touch
of
butter
also
easy
to
drink
if
not
the
most
flavourful
of
beers
could
be
nice
on
cask
for
some
lengthier
sessions
another
imaginative
wychwood
label
this
low
alcohol
offering
has
a
malty
sweetness
with
a
crisp
cookie
bite
which
fights
oddly
with
a
dirty
hop
bitterness
which
one
is
david
and
which
one
is
goliath
probably
depends
on
your
personal
preferences
this
one
rests
easy
on
the
palette
leaving
behind
a
complex
residue
of
tastes
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
think
for
me
the
initial
sweetness
is
not
to
my
taste
overall
nothing
ground
breaking
here
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
pleasant
light
taste
it
would
probably
work
well
as
a
session
beer
if
you
dont
get
bored
with
the
taste
after
1
bottle
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again

this

aside
from
the
dnd

who
want
a
change
from
their
hobgoblins
for
the
campaign

this
brewery
has
succeeded
once
again
in
crafting
a
pleasant
but
ordinary
beer
if
brewing
awards
were
given
out
for
mediocrity
wychwood
would
have
a
tone
of
trophies
on
their
shelf
mind
you
thats
not
to
take
anything
away
from
them
who
doesnt
enjoy
a
straightforward
pint
of
plain
agreeable

many
drinkers
enjoy
nothing

overall
this
is
fairly

but
inoffensive
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
was
given
to
me
but
probably
wouldnt
actively
seek
this
out
not
a
terrible
beer
but
pretty
weak
stuff
but
then
i
didnt
really
expect
much
from
this
brewery
based
on
what
i
have
had
from
them
in
the
past
od
not
a
bad
epa
could
use
some
work
to
accentuate
that
citrus
and
make
it
better
but
very
drinkable
and
not
bad
it
still
seems
pretty
basic
and
slightly
mild
but
for
its
abv
i
can
enjoy
it
this
is
a
great
light
and
bitter
session
ale
in
my
books
though
a
bit
lacklustre
compared
to
other
wychwoodmarstons
offerings
too
bad
its
a
seasonal
release
where
i
live
because
id
drink
it
often
in
place
of
a
beer
like
tetleys
smooth
flow
o
a
forgettable
brew
from
wychwood
a
really
average
brew
at
best
would
maker
a
laker
before
i
pay
for
this
one
again
d
fragrant
flavourful
and
sessionable
the
goliath
strikes
me
as
an
unorthodox
english
pale
ale
in
a
good
way
i
didnt
find
the
offensive
metallic
or
medicinal
notes
that
other
reviewers
mentioned
so
ill
chalk
it
up
to
taste
and
just
say
that
i
personally
found
goliath
well
worthwhile
overall
not
really
to
my
liking
not
a
great
example
of
an
english
pale
a
miss
for
me
a
brew
named
goliath
deserves
better
than
the
standard
epa
treatment
goliath
is
a
name
that
fits
other
brews
in
the
wychwood
lineup
but
certainly
not
this
one
stick
with
hobgoblin
or
fiddlers
its
got
everything
going
for
it
except
for
the
obvious
flaw
mentioned
a
few
times
already
too
bad
the
booze
and
structure
are
quite
appealing
id
peg
this
more
as
an
english
bitter
yet
even
still
it
tends
to
be
on
the
underwhelming
end
of
things
its
a
fairly
easy
drinker
but
lacks
balance
dr
its
easy
to
down
but
far
too
expensive
at
least
in
ireland
d
very
good
sessionable
ale
this
one
very
drinkable
great
session
ale
quite
thirst
quenching
not
the
best
ale
in
the
world
drinkable
but
ive
had
better
and
other
offerings
from
this

are

i
would

it
once
in

d

not
one
id
drink
very
often
i
suppose
the
goliath
is
suitable
to
slay

mighty
thirst
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
not
really
a
session
abv
could
be
lower
d
a
nice
clean
drinking
ale
that
slides
down
a
real
treat
on
a
hot
summers
day
but
is
good
all
year
round
a
little
bit
too
fizzy
but
not
overall
a
bad
beer
not
quite
the
session
beer
it
could
be
dvery
drinkable
especially
at
4
2abv
that
was
the
version
i
tried
good
medium
body
but
a
little
too
much
carbonation
moderately
low
abv
add
to
the
great
flavor
of
this
very
drinkable
brew
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
was
that
it
couldnt
decide
whether
it
wanted
to
be
hoppy
or
malty
and
failed
at
both
its
not
by
any
means
a
terrible
beer
but
the
flavors
just
couldnt
decide
what
to
do
with
themselves
this
is
anothe
5050
beer
from
wychwood
i
am
not
going
to
rush
out
and
buy
a
crate
of
this
but
if
someone
offered
me
a
pint
in
a
pub
id
except
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
not
too
filling
but
definitely
not
light
weak
drinkability
is
nice
although
not
really
a
session
for
me
definitely
something
that
i
would
enjoy
again
an
odd
one
wychwood

to

it
does
taste
as
the
nose
suggests
to

with

then
the
dried

falls
through
a
metaphorical
trap
door
before
a
little
kick
returns
to
finish
things
off
there
is
an
edge
of
bitterness
to
the
aftertaste
which
finds
me
wanting
to
quaff
the
beer
unusually
quickly
that
makes
it
drinkable
but
paradoxically
i
wish
it
were
less
drinkable
a
660ml

should
last
me
a

with
a

the
aftertaste
is
much
more
pleasant
than
the
foretaste

the

the

undesirable
impacts
on
the
quality
and
texture
of
the
beer
either
p

i
picked
up

from

it

anyway
drinkability
i
find
that
english
pale
ales
each
have
their
own
personality
somewhat
like
the
dotty
characters
that
appear
on
the
bbc
imports
this
one
is
certainly
different
and
while
drinkable
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
very
often
other
comments
like
all
the
other
wychwood
beers
ive
tried
all
right
theyve
got
that
whole
mystical
thing
going
on
which
is
kind
of
cute
i
guess
but
if
they
put
a
little
more
of
that
energy
into
making
the
beer
then
perhaps
wed
have
something
more
interesting
and
for
crying
out
loud
start
using
brown
bottles
decent
maltiness
with
appropriate
bitterness
for
the
style
all
in
all
would
be
a
good
brew
if
found
on
tap
or
anything
but
these
vile
clear
glass
bottles
thay
wychwood
always
seems
to
use
in
those

found
here
in
the

the
beer

the

somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
not
as
bad
as
i
had
expected
very
drinkable
and
non
offensive
i
was
afraid
of
this
upon
first
glance
of
that
clear
bottled
import
indeed
i
had
to
practically
leave
the
room
when
i
popped
the
top
on
this
guy
the
skunk
never
did
subside
but
it
did
diminish
the
appearance
was
a
beautiful
golden
hue
with
not
too
much
of
a
head
as
is
to
be
expected
it
was
not
overhopped
although
my
olefactory
system
was
not
in
prime
working
order
due
to
the
skunk
i
would
like
to
give
this
fabled
ale
a
fair
shake
in
england
someday
without
the
spector
of
sunexposure
looming
over
all
my
senses
i
did
enjoy
the
ale
and
polished
it
off
in
short
order
earning
it
subjective
high
marks
for
drinkability
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
not
great
but
was
close
to
style
i
may
use
this
ale
to
introduce
folks
to
other
kinds
of
beer

consists
of
a
dry

with

the

consists
of
an

bite
and
is
watery
bitter
on
the
tail
it
has
a
slight
complexity
but
far
too
mild
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
brew
that
has
a
light
dry
finish
not
recommended
at
all
this
is
a
fine
example
of
not
judging
a

its

it

with

a

is
coming

out
an
enjoyable
session
beer
eh
this
was
a
sucky
beer
i
was
expecting
something
big
and
strong
like
goliath
it
was
skunky
and
hoppy
two
things
that
dont
mix
it
looked
ok
which
was
its
best
quality
it
was
a
light
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
was
thick
but
then
died
out
to
a
laceing
other
than
the
looks
it
had
not
redeaming
quality
i
would
pass
on
it
unless
you
are
looking
to
up
your
reviews
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
aroma
smells
of
yeast
and
carapils
malts
there
is
not
much
there
but
what
is
there
smells
good
the
taste
is
really
plain
a
little
malt
flavor
and
light
english
noble
hops
this
seems
to
be
the
trend
from
this
brewery
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
although
they
could
use
to
drop
the
co2
pressure
while
priming
their
beers
its
a
light
bodied
beer
and
one
that
you
can
drink
plenty
of
its

the

was
citrusy

malty
with
a

to
it
the
taste
was
alright
pleasantly
drinkable
but
nothing
spectacular
to
set
this
beer
apart
from
many
other
english
ales
ive
had
the
hops
kick
in
around
the
middle
of
the
flavor
profile
and
trail
off
to
a
nice
dry
finish
drinkable
but
after
one
bottle
it
gets
boring
not
as
sticky
and
syruppy
as
the
circle
master
which
i
just
recently
had
bittersweet
resiny
hops
slightly
bready
and
oily
gimmicky
bottle
a
large
660ml
bottle
pretty
broing
and
hard
to
finish
due
to
boredom
tastes
like
any
other
mass
prodeced
english
bitter
an
easy
drinking
ale
to
say
the
least
quick
jabs
of
malt
hops
and
yeast
byproducts
keep
the
palate
in
check
id
definitely
gauge
this
as
a
lunch
time
brew
or
something
to
have
over
a
long
session
needless
to
say
it
is
worth
a
try
this
stuff
came
in
a
big
clear
660
ml
bottle
but
i
was
surprised
at
the
low
alcohol
content
out
of
the
bottle
it
looks
and
smells
like
a
dirty
40
oz
of
cheap
malt
liquor
although
it
is
slightly
darker
once
poured
it
smelled
strongly
of
fruit
particularly
pineapple
im
really
serious
drinkable
but
not
very
good
at
all
pours
a
very
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
of
malt
bread
and
tobacco
malt
follows
through
on
taste
with
a
bit
of
bitter
caramel
a
bit
of
oil
on
the
tongue
with
some
carbonation
very
quaffable
beer
nothing
spectacular
just
solid
pours
a
darkened
amber
color
a
nice
heavy
wood
tone
quite
cloudy
i
can
just
see
the
shadows
of
my
fingers
through
the
full
glass
the
head
is
creamcolored
and
creamy
its
a
mediumthick
blanket
of
foam
that
sticks
on
top
of
the
beer
for
a
good
long
time
solid
lacing
a
doughy
rich
malt
flavor
comes
out
as
the
strongest
note
in
the
aroma
theres
also
a
good
dose
of
caramel
and
some
light
earthy
hops
the
hops
make
a
stronger
showing
in
the
taste
with
a
gentle
bitterness
and
a
mix
of
floral
earthy
and
grassy
flavors
with
a
touch
of
citrus
peel
the
beer
is
drier
than
expected
which
is
a
pleasant
surprise
it
has
a
clean
rich
malt
character
that
steps
aside
to
let
the
hops
balance
things
out
very
easy
to
drink
relatively
low
carbonation
smooth
creamy
feel
it
manages
to
hit
a
rather
britishy
balance
which
is
generally
hard
to
find
among
american
takes
on
british
ales
good
stuff
another
fine
brew
found

pours
to
a
generous

up
where
aroma
started
with

malty
backbone
with

malt
and
maris
otter
malt
with
a
balancing
charge
of
floralearthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
no
astringency
and
appropriate
carbonation
overall
a
fine
english
bitter
that
takes
regional
standards
to
a
new
level
o
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
for

afternoon
game

dry
countered
by
a

backbone
with

crisp
slightly
bitter
finish
pretty
quaffable
but
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
glass
of
in
a
sitting
overall
i
need
to
say
that
i
really
didnt
like
this
very
much
the
initial
flavors
and
smell
are
good
but
the
more
important
taste
doesnt
hold
up
thanks
to
luis
for
bringing
this
back
from
k
c
for
me
to
try
o
easy
to
drink
slightly
bitter
but
not
overly
so
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
short
setting
seek
out
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
english
bitter
another
good
brew
from
marshall
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
not
overly
hoppy
for
those
who
dont
care
for
the
bitterness
but
just
enough
for
those
of
us
who
do
its
a
very
well
rounded
beer
definitely
worth
the
buy
a
worthy
session
beer
pretty
big
for
the
bitter
style
yeast
and
constant
bisucity
flavor
takes
away
from
the
drinkabilty
though
it
ends
up
being
an
ok
quaff
d
easy
drinker
good
for
the
style
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tapcask
sessionable
all
night
too
bad
i
only
bought
a
single
an
incredibly
silky
feel
this
beer
is
bursting
with
character
like
it
has
a
story
to
tell
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
and
tasty
definitely
a
bit
of
an
american
slant
to
it
but
its
a
pretty
good
shot
at
the
style
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
too
bad
more
of
an
esb
i
think
than
a
straight
bitter
but
a
drinkable
beer
poured
a
very
murky
amber
color
with
a
huge
head
i
poured
timidly
and
got
almost
four
fingers
smell
is
kinda
stinky
really
grassy
or
more
like
some
kind
of
growing
plants
not
really
grass
or
flowers
or
herbs
very
different
smell
to
me
i
read
the
style
info
on
this
site
to
help
me
understand
but
doesnt
really
explain
it
to
me
with
every
sip
i
enjoy
it
more
kinda
reminds
me
of
earthy
roots
yeah
im
not
a
big
radish
fan
but
it
reminds
me
of
some
roots
very
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
not
as
carbonated
as
the
appearance
portrayed
drinkability
is
decent
i
wish
i
knew
exactly
what
this
taste
was
d
easily
drinkable
could
be
a
bit
better
blended
flavor
and
better
balance
but
still
a
good
beer
overall
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
flavor
has
a
few
attributes
that
could
be
cleaned
up
but
nice
to
see
another
option
in
this
style
will
try
it
again
if
i
happen
to
come
across
in
the
future
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
while
this
might
not
be
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
style
its
still
comparable
to
the
best
its
very
solid
and
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
the
mouthfeel
seems
pretty
full
bodied
with
a
low
to
medium
amount
of
carbonation
its
really
smooth
and
excellent
drinkability
this
beer
would
really
shine
on
cask
d
if
i
lived
in
oklahoma
this
would
be
a
beer
that
would
pretty
much
always
be
in
my
fridge
its
a
good
everyday
type
of
drinking
beer
with
a
reasonable
abv
and
good
taste
its
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
to
have
around
looking
at
the
later
reviews
this
might
have
been
a
bad
batch
this
aint
half
bad
for
an
oklahoma
beer
id
love
to
have
this
on
tap
at
mcnellies
overall
a
decent
ale
its
quite
a
bit
different
than
most
of
the
bitters
ive
had
in
england
but
nonetheless
its
a
decent
flavorful
pint
the
flavor
was
great
and
had
a
smoothness
to
which
im
unaccustomed
will
look
for
this
again
to
see
if
the
carbonation
problem
is
a
chronic
one
highly
recommend
this
beer
so
proud
of
all
of
the
excellent
okie
beers
ive
had
lately
an
exceptional
ale
from
marshall
brewing
co
pours
a
hazy
golden
brown
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
with
grassy
hop
smells
as
well
as
some
malt
the
flavor
is
malty
sweetness
with
toffee
and
biscuit
malt
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
and
you
also
get
some
spiciness
towards
the
end
thinmedium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
thanks
again
blueokie
d
i
wonder
if
there
was
something
off
with
the
batch
and
the
cider
once
this
went
away
this
was
an
outstanding
bitter
that
i
would
definitely
have
a
few
pints
of
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
with
a
full
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
fairly
soon
thereafter
appearance
was
offwhite
to
sallow
and
completely
opaque
asked
the
barserver
if
it
was
always
this
cloudy
and
was
told
it
must
be
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
where
the
alcohol
is
higher
and
other
stuff
made
perfect
sense
to
me
smell
was
average
and
beery
with
nothing
distinctive
taste
was
flat
and
thin
with
a
hint
of
toffee
finish
was
acidic
with
only
a
slight
floral
bitterness
an
average
brew
that
i
wouldnt
care
to
try
again
unless
it
was
from
a
newly
tapped
keg
and
wasnt
overly
cloudy
hopefully
that
was
the
reason
for
the
unremarkable
taste
conclusion
nice
english
bitter
if
nothing
extraordinary
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
as
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
not
one
we
see
a
lot
of
in
the
states
alcohol
is
pretty
negligible
feel
more
then
the
actual
flavor
is
what
sells
it
a
quencher
with
quite
decent
flavor
too
drinkability
excellent
session
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
m
this
was
quite
the
suprise
beer
for
me
to
drink
it
is
quite
smooth
and
actually
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
of
it
after
the
bottle
is
gone
i
could
make
this
a
everyday
drinker
if
it
was
readily
available
to
me
kind
of
sad
that
this
beer
isnt

lane
received
this
in
trade
from
stephens101
i
believe
shared
with
some
of
the
regulars
at
the
brick
store
pub
this
is
a
very
nice
english
bitter
it
surely
would
have
been
nice
if
marshall
brewing
company
had
been
open
when
i
lived
in
tulsa
a
while
ago
very
well
done
beer
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
smells
somewhat
light
and
yeasty
but
with
a
nice
dry
biscuity
smell
in
the
background
tastes
very
clean
and
restrained
with
good
typical
english
malt
notes
slightly
biscuity
soft
and
with
a
subtle
earthy
bitterness
soft
on
the
palate
up
front
but
with
just
enough
dry
bitterness
to
give
it
some
snap
at
the
end
really
a
very
well
made
beer
nice
to
try
something
so
well
made
from
oklahoma
good
very
very
impressed
with
this
beer
especially
as
id
never
heard
of
the
brewer
before
we
cracked
this
bottle
a
top
tier
bitter
with
an
impressive
hop
profile
and
super
high
drinkability
drank
like
mothers
milk
highly
recommended
if
you
come
across
it
the
bottle
version
is
great
on
cask
this
is
exceptional
as
good
as
good
as
any
of
the
great
cask
beers
i
have
had
in
scotland
this
should
be
on
cask
at
every
bar
possible
highly
recommended
on
cask
or

marshall
is
kicking
ass
with
the
cask
ales
definitely
thank
you
eric
company
nice
melding
of
earthy
hops
and
carameltoffee
flavors
reminds
one
of
fullers
esb
which
is
certainly
a
compliment
mcnellies
pub

down
too
fast
and
easily

cheers
beertracker
if
you
are
in
the
tulsa
area
and
are
able
to
try
this

i
highly
recommend
you
do
it
is
completely
different
than
the
kegged
and
bottled
versions
someone
what
spicy
but
went
well
with
spciy

well

which
follows
through
to
the
taste
nicely

of

on

nice

easy

with

backbone
with
some
of

a
welldone
special
bitter
not
experienced
often
outside
the
uk
i
recently
read
where
mcnellies
actually
loses
money
by
serving
this
beer
and
that
is
a
sad
state
of
affairs
so
if
youre
ever
at
mcnellies
in
tulsa
or
okc
have
a
couple
of
these
and
support
cask
beer
in
oklahoma
version
i
had
was
from
de
molen
cease
and
desist
wort
balanced
easy
to
drink
good
for
style
o
what
a
score
whatever
batch
they
washed
this
off
of
follows
the
trend
of
local
milds
i
had
out
there
softbready
foundation
with
a
punch
of
bold
toasted
grain
and
earthy
hop
dancing
upon
it
pretty
good
flavor
and
drinkable
its
shocking
how
much
flavor
is
brought
at
3
2
seriously
its
a
massive
achievement
and
this
is
just
a
real
good
beer
on
the
whole
this
is
a
picture
perfect
session
brew
a
decent
beer
but
in
my
opinion
not
quite
as
enjoyable
as
the
other
little
dog
offerings
i
have
tried
also
posted
this
review
under
little
dog
fred
since
many
people
here
are
reviewing
the
fred
and
adam
little
dog
under
this
umbrella
after
working
my
way
through
and
adam
from
the
wood
and
needing
to
stay
upright
for
many
more
hours
i
decided
to
give
little
dog
a
taste
it
was
interesting
and
it
certainly
manages
to
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
lowabv
beer
a
nice
contrast
with
hotds
heavier
offerings
a
good
way
to
start
my
time
at
their
bar
this
is
a
very
intriguing
ale
the
small
beer
concept
is
executed
here
with
some
serious
panache
and
i
like
the
result
very
good
o
so
damn
drinkable
truly
a
sessionable
beer
low
alcohol
and
bold
flavors
and
cheap
draft
price
too
would
keep
me
returning
to
this
again
and
again
as
a
small
beer
this
may
not
be
to
everyones
liking
but
im
fascinated
by
it
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
as
long
as
alan
and
crew
keep
brewing
fred
doggie
claws
adam
etc
seems
more
like
a
veritable
continental
pils
and
a
good
one
at
that
the
lower
booze
to
no
apparent
detriment
provides
a
nice
offset
to
the
other
higher
octane
offerings
from
this
brewery
o
average
second
runnings
of
doggie
or
fred
may
be
good
for
some
but
not
this
guy
not
a
fan
and
i
prefer
the
first
runnings
and
i
dont
see
how
this
could
be
classified
as
an
apa
either
sessionable
to
the
extreme
but
great
beers
to
boot
overall
an
interesting
and
well
crafted
beer
but
not
one
i
desire
to
drink
again
session
ale
for
sure
i
could
definitely
sit
around
drinking
these
all
night
gotta
love
a
great
sessionable
beer
by
hotd
this
small
beer
from
the
second
runnings
of
a

little

in
many
ways
has
similar
characteristics
i
felt
to
greg
in
that
is
seems
to
have
a
crispness
like
a
white
wine
drinkability
very
drinkable
good
session
beer
happy
to
see
this
on
draft
as
the
hotd
beers
are
usually
slow
sippers
o
a
very
sound
beer
but
not
particularly
inspired
would
complement
a
ploughmans
beautifully
it
is
a
straight
forward
bitter
ale
no
thrills
overall
a
really
nice
offering
from
the
now
owned
by
fullers
brewery
should
be
noted
that
this
pub
has
always
served
beer
at
a
perfect
for
me
temperature
taste
is
really
nice
great
sweet
malty
flavors
and
maybe
some
toffe
but
is
well
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
easy
drinker
but
heavy
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
bitters
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
bitters
ive
had
to
date
pours
a
clear
ruby
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
sweet
caramelized

hopsa
touch
of
dried

and
also
some

dark
portthe
mouthfeel
is
just
over
light
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
dark
ripe
fruitssweet
caramelmarzipansticky
toffee
and
finished
with
a
earthy
hop
bittersweetness
and
overall
its
alright
and
different
but
not
my
favourite
example
of
the
style
cheers
cask
was
in
good
condition
no
complaints
cask
conditioned
at
the
hogshead
pub
ipswich
deep
amber
to
brown
colour
low
head
moderate
aroma
of
english
malt
vinegar
and

the
flavour
is
dusty
malty
with
notes
of
malt
vinegar
and
sour
fruits
dusty
hops
in
the
finish
okish
well
balanced
and
well
done
very
balanced
overall
but
i
was
a
bit
surprised
with
this
being
a
bitter
since
there
is
precious
little
hop
that
can
be
felt
in
this
brew
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
maybe
just
maybe
a
little
bland
especially
compared
to
fullers
esb
for
example
d
smells
great
but
the
taste
really
isnt
the
greatest
and
the
mouthfeel
really
hurts
this
one
i
remember
this
being
a
million
times
better
when
i
had
it
out
of
a
cask
and
hopefully
i
will
be
able
to
try
it
again
that
way
to
post
another
review
for
this
beer
i
wouldnt
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
but
would
love
to
try
it
out
of
the
cask
the
aroma
is
watery
fruitiness
some
caramel
and
bitter
hops
the
taste
though
pokes
your
tongue
awake
wow
lots
of
flavor
rich
malt
fruit
the
bitterness
has
a
slight
sourness
which
adds
a
lot
of
interest
the
body
is
lightmedium
the
brew
is
super
silky
smooth
very
nice
and
very
very
drinkable
i
would
love
to
have
this
beer
available
in
my
market
d
not
bad
a
solid
best
bitter
d
terrific
on
cask
privileged
to
have
tried
it
in
this
form
bitters
and
i
get
along
just
swimmingly
so
this
will
be
a
sessional
for
me
in
the
future
good
offering
incredible
how
they
replicated
the
caskfeel
so
well
in
a
bottle
adding
to
the
drinkability
factor
very
wellbalanced
and
delicious
complex
in
a
soft
and
subtle
way
this
is
an
exceptional
bitter
gales
hsb
now
brewed
at
fullers
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
dark
ale
that
is
highly
drinkible
and
not
to
heavy
but
also
not
watery
the
taste
is
quite
strong
with
a
slight
fruit
taste
and
also
quite
fruit
cakey
witha
malty
base
and
a
slight
hop
kick
this
is
my
favorite
gales
beer
and
can
be
drunk
all
night
long
4
5
m4
d
very
rounded
mouthfeel
throughout
good
depth
of
dark
malts
and
refreshingly
bitter
texture
are
the
winners
for
this
beer
very
very
nice
bitter
indeed
extremely
drinkable
for
me
especially
in
autumn
its
somewhat
understandable
why
brits
are
able
to
down
pint
after
pint
of
dark
ales
after
youve
had
a
brew
like
hsb
it
may
be
dark
but
it
goes
down
smooth
and
keeps
you
thirsty
for
more
easy
to
quaff
and
leaves
a
satisfying
malt
aftertaste
i
know
this
to
be
one
of
the
more
popular
bitters
in
england
so
i
can
only
hope
that
it
may
one
day
be
exported
to
the
us
to
satisfy
our
ever
expanding
national
beer
palette
the
taste
clings
to
your
palat
this
is
a
good
beer
glad
i
reintroduced
myself
to
it
i
wont
wait
so
long
between
visits
again
drinkability
the
good
flavour
but
mild
aroma
combines
to
give
a
fairly
light
feel
to
this
best
bitter
nothing
outstanding
however
a
good
session
bitter
for
those
who
prefer
a
stronger
pint
other
comments
bitters
bore
me
a
bit
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
smooth
and
drinkable
its
a
shame
that
this
brewery
has
been
bought
out
by
fullers
and
consequently
might
be
closed
down
i
cant
make
up
my
mind
about
this
beer
it
tastes
of
quality
brewing
but
at
the
same
time
its
sort
of
bland
i
drank
it
bottle
conditioned
it
poured
in
a
nice
amber
color
its
smooth
and
creamy
and
has
a
toffee
taste
somewhere
in
the
background
fruity
smell
it
looses
most
of
its
dynamics
if
served
just
a
little
too
cold
looking
at
the
average
ba
score
i
think
its
overrated
perhaps
its
better
on
tap
i
like
this
even
though
its
from
a
can
i
like
it
its
one
of
the
stand
by
ales
i
keep
in
the
house
the
hops
are
impressive
even
under
these
poor
conditions
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
its
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
short
lasting
head
and
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
raisins
raw
husky
grains
and
alcohol
solvency
virtually
no
hops
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
bland
maltiness
there
is
very
little
hoppiness
even
for
an
english
bitter
its
a
very
one
dimensional
taste
the
least
hoppy
of
all
the
cask
bitters
i
tried
some
sort
of
burnt
quality
burnt
grains
is
noticeable
in
the
finish
not
very
impressive
drinkability
is
very
high
could
sit
in
the
garden
all
day
and
drink
this
beauty
a
2nd
prop
goes
to
the
cellarman
at
the
castle
in
cambridge
for
this
wellkept
beauty
this
is
an
excellent
bitter
simply
excellent
good
color
with
little
head
has
an
excellent
malt
smell
the
taste
is
very
good
incredibly
drinkable
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
hops
presence
you
want
to
have
this
at
a
nice
temperature
a
very
good
balance
for
a
bitter
carboniation
seems
perfect
for
mouthfeel
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
session
brews
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
makes
me
rethink
the
quality
of
canned
beers
this
might
be
the
best
thing
thats
ever
happened
to
a
can
bought
a
four
pack
of
this
at
monster
beverage
in
glassboro
nj
poured
a
bright
and
clean
orangey
amber
brown
and
was
topped
off
by
a
rich
and
creamy
head
of
tan
foam
the
aroma
has
some
metallic
notes
and
leans
more
towards
the
sweet
and
malty
side
rather
than
the
bitter
and
hoppy
has
a
candy
like
caramel
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
full
of
flavor
and
the
sweetness
is
dead
on
the
hops
are
there
but
barely
noticeable
nicely
blended
this
leaves
a
sweet
butter
toffee
tang
on
the
tongue
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
although
it
should
have
been
a
bit
warmer
canned
or
not
this
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
a
most
enjoyable
pint
easily
one
of
the
best
bitters
ive
had
if
not
the
best
i
actually
feel
a
little
sad
when
i
take
a
sip
as
i
want
the
glass
to
last
forever
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
bitter
and
im
determined
to
track
down
a
cask
perhaps
this
is
my
holy
grail
the
only
thing
keeping
this
beer
from
a
straight
5
review
is
the
fact
that
i
know
its
got
to
be
even
more
amazing
cask
conditioned
my
only
complaints
are
that
im
having
a
difficult
time
allowing
it
to
warm
and
the
only
place
i
know
of
that
sells
it
is
a
small
store
in
north
jersey
i
cant
get
enough
a
case
or
two
is
coming
home
with
me
next
time
i
see
it
a
slightly
hazy
chestnut
body
with
deep
reddishcopper
highlights
is
topped
by
a
goodsized
head
of
rocky
vanilla
foam
the
head
holds
quite
well
and
it
leaves
some
very
nice
rings
of
lace
throughout
the
pint
the
nose
displays
an
earthymineral
but
not
quite
metallic
and
leafy
character
that
seems
to
come
from
a
combination
of
both
malt
and
hops
over
a
decidedly
caramelish
malt
the
medium
body
is
accentuated
by
a
very
fine
and
delicate
carbonation
that
leaves
it
creamy
soft
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
theres
just
enough
carbonation
to
give
it
a
little
mouthfeel
and
bring
out
the
flavors
without
becoming
gassy
very
nice
and
perfect
for
a
session
beer
the
flavor
reveals
basically
what
the
aroma
indicates
with
a
maltiness
thats
just
as
equally
earthy
and
dusty
as
it
is
caramelish
with
a
touch
of
mineral
some
leafy
hops
and
a
mild
woodiness
more
complexities
arise
however
with
a
bit
more
investigation
theres
an
underlying
touch
of
yeasty
berrylike
fruitiness
and
a
toasty
chocolate
side
to
the
malt
that
becomes
quite
apparent
in
the
finish
its
very
wellbalanced
with
a
bitterness
seems
to
hide
itself
in
the
shadows
but
continually
keeps
things
dry
without
ever
building
on
the
palate
again
its
perfectly
balanced
and
makes
for
an
excellent
session
ale
theres
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
throughout
an
evening
a
brilliant
balance
that
makes
it
workable
and
a
low
enough
alcohol
that
you
can
do
it
at
a
session
pace
brilliant
medium
brown
color
large
head
aroma
is
nutty
and
malty
toasted
malt
flavor
nicely
hopped
good

nice
flavor
large

somewhat
dry

aftertaste
is

good
example
of
an
english
bitter
seems
not
to
suffer
from
living
in
an
aluminum

with

soft

with

of

low

in

with
some

short

high

very
nicely
made
very
nive
english
bitter
had
it
on
cask
and
enjoyed
it
a
lot
a
good
example
of
the
style
lots
of
zesty
hops
with
a
decent
maltiness
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
while
kicking
back
talking
with
the
cute
barmaids
and
watching
a
pivotal
playoffimplication
hockey
game
quite
possibly
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
on
the
palate
where
nothing
overwhelms
and
all
is
in
harmony
a
topnotch
session
beer
to
say
the
least
and
much
like
a
cask
ale
in
the
bottle
we
need
more
real
englishstyle
bitters
in
the
us
ill
have
to
write
congress
hsb
starts
off
with
a
decided
hop
presence
i
noticed
it
more
on
tap
than
i
remembered
in
bottle
and
firm
bitterness
with
a
round
almost
buttery
malt
to
complement
the
hops
the
hops
are
present
throughout
the
sip
leaving
a
pleasant
just
shy
of
unbalanced
bitterness
on
the
tongue
along
with
the
lingering
malt
flavors
as
the
brew
warms
the
malt
comes
to
the
forefront
as
expected
a
very
very
drinkable
ale
well
ill
have
to
try
this
again
elsewhere
one
could
tell
the
right
flavors
are
there
pours
a
rich
and
deep
golden
color
with
a
creamy
foam
topping
and
plenty
of
lacing
aroma
of
doughy
malts
and
lightly
citrusy
hops
in
the
taste
a
firm
malt
foundation
with
earthy
rooty
hop
character
firmly
bitter
this
fits
the
style
quite
nicely
the
body
is
light
smooth
and
gently
carbonated
refreshing
and
bitter
overall
this
was
a
really
good
real
ale
this
was
a
nice
little
bitter
that
i
wasnt
expecting
pretty
authentic
good
hop
bill
wellcrafted
overall
easy
drinking
and
mild
on
taste
fairly
traditional
notbad
but
a
bit
unexceptional
the
one
slight
complaint
i
would
have
would
be
that
i
felt
the
beer
was
overly
carbonated
i
like
a
little
less
for
an
esb
whereas
i
felt
like
this
was
carbonated
like
a
summer
pils
or
the
like
i
liked
this
one
enough
to
have
a
couple
pints
of
it
its
nice
to
find
a
tasty
craft
brew
that
is
under
5
abv
and
a
cask
that
is
treated
well
is
always
a
treat
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
enjoyed
this
one
finding
that
each
sip
followed
naturally
from
the
other
i
certainly
would
be
willing
to
have
this
one
again
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
well
made
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
that
is
well
worth
drinking
d
all
round
great
session
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
and
ease
of
drinkability
this
was
another
pleasant
enough
quaff
that
i
found
on
the
hand
pumps
here
at
sly
fox
this
bitter
had
some
bite
but
was
still
mostly
well
balanced
and
the
easy
feel
from
the
cask
and
lower
abv
kept
this
drinking
nicely
sessionable
little
brew
here
i
have
not
seen
sly
fox
chester
county
bitter
before
but
since
it
was
offered
on
cask
at
local
44
i
thought
that
i
would
give
it
a
try
since
the
beers
they
present
on
hand
pumps
are
always
well
done
this
is
a
beer
that
had
a
good
bit
of
dry
hopping
either
in
fermentation
or
on
cask
that
really
adds
a
nice
woody
fresh
hop
aroma
and
flavor
the
malt
adds
a
bready
character
that
helps
ground
the
beer
and
provided
the
body
that
a
smaller
hopped
beer
requires
d
drinability
is
off
the
charts
a
great
tasting
esb
that
is
sub
5
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
d
this
is
a
good
easy
drinker
that
wont
challenge
your
taste
buds
good
preparation
for
my
most
anticipated
firkin
beer
of
the
night
dfhs
75
min
had
a
glass
on
cask
at
tap
and
table
i
always
like
a
good
bitter
but
the
red
color
is
a
little
dark
for
a
bitter
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
crystal
malts
theres
the
color
really
the
beer
just
tasted
like
a
lighter
amberred
ale
on
cask
thats
not
all
bad
there
was
a
please
citrus
hop
note
in
addition
to
the
caramelized
malt
but
id
hope
for
more
depth
its
ok
for
an
american
version
of
the
style
but
american
craft
brewers
are
showing
they
dont
do
subtlety
real
well
right
now
the
english
are
kicking
our
asses
in
the
bitter
category
cask
at
coles
cask
festival
a
fine
bitter
although
a
sour
finish
pros
were
the
understated
bitterness
and
full
mouthfeel
a
faint
caesar
crown
an
apple
juice
colour
is
it
infection
sourness
does
spoil
getting
it
spot
in
still
a
drinkable
one
i
will
definitely
look
for
more
from
sly
fox
overall
one
of
the
best
american
bitters
ive
had
but
a
little
too
much
hop
particularly
dry
hopping
turns
a
fabulous
beer
into
a
good
beer
by
throwing
balance
off
a
bit
that
said
darn
tasty
overall
a
tasty
and
easily
sessionable
ale
clean
crisp
and
extremely
smooth
creamy
body
very
drinkable
with
light
sweet
english
malts
subtle
spiciness
and
a
very
crisp
clean
floral
hop
flavor
the
alcohol
is
very
well
balanced
considering
this
beer
is
7
which
is
very
high
for
a
traditional
english
real
ale
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
that
high
in
abv
disqualifies
it
as
a
session
beer
but
it
drinks
like
one
and
is
a
very
complex
with
a
lot
of
full
flavors
the
hops
really
come
through
in
the
finish
but
not
in
an
overpowering
or
bitter
fashion
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
an
excellent
american
interpretation
of
the
classic
british
style
i
will
be
drinking
a
lot
more
of
it
soon
o
very
well
done

the
orchard

forward
is
a
great
session
beer
and
even
better
on

when
casked
overall
impression
a
surprisingly
good
ale
from
greene
king
not
as
good
as
abbot
ale
in
my
opinion
but
at
nearly
a
full
percent
abv
less
than
the
abbot
ruddles
county
achieves
great
flavor
and
a
nimble
body
definitely
a
great
session
beer
overall
a
decent
if
not
outstanding
beer
im
going
to
give
this
one
a
few
bonus
points
for
its
great
quaffability
a
bit
mild
for
greatness
but
wonderful
for
a
session
o
quite
a
nice
bitter
not
outstanding
but
well
executed
nonetheless
it
was
a
bargain
at
1
99
euro
it
was
on
special
i
liked
the
dryness
on
the
mouthfeel
also
a
little
stickiness
from
the
hops
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
the
delicious
bitterness
sticks
with
you
for
a
while
sticky
lingering
mouth
feel
pours
a
beautiful
clear
coppery
dark
amber
with
a
thick
fluffy
pale
beige
head
crisp
aroma
is
strong
but
rather
typically
malty
with
a
hint
of
pear
malty
flavor
has
an
undertone
of
pear
and
just
a
little
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
smooth
texture
has
only
average
body
and
just
a
teeny
bit
of
tingle
not
great
but
still
palatable
give
it
a
fair
shake
d
highly
quaffable
this
is
a
style
that
i
have
never
been
too
impressed
with
however
i
am
enjoying
just
about
everything
about
this
brew
just
a
perfect
balance
between
hop
and
grain
to
make
a
flavorful
and
very
easy
drinking
brew
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
english
bitter
a
decent
bitter
better
than
average
for
sure
my
father
says
it
was
much
better
in
years
gone
by
my
then
what
a
beer
it
was
then
then
o
a
solid
sessionable
ale
though
im
glad
to
have
had
it
fresh
in
past
experiences
this
beer
has
conveyed
a
slightly
metallic
off
putting
flavor
if
left
on
the
shelves
too
long
perhaps
due
to
the
clear
bottle
notes
wow
this
one
does
it
for
me
and
then
some
a
dry
fruity
epa
with
an
earthy
aftertaste
samuel
smiths
old
brewery
pale
ale
is
currently
my
favorite
epa
but
this
one
isnt
far
behind
i
will
buy
this
again
and
again
this
is
what
i
love
about
good
british
ales
its
flavors
are
full
and
mature
but
it
is
nonetheless
a
highly
quaffable
beer
ook
that
skunk
smell
at
first
was
sort
of
a
turn
off
but
overall
it
was
not
bad
maybe
it
is
just
a
freshness
issue
copper
in
color
and
cloudy
offwhite
head
with
very
small
bubbles
that
leave
no
lacing
strong
toasty
aroma
almost
burnt
with
a
hint
of
grape
smooth
lightmedium
body
with
low
carbonation
a
little
thin
but
not
watery
taste
is
sweet
but
not
overpowering
with
caramel
and
malt
aftertaste
is
peppery
and
bready
and
lingers
pleasantly
around
the
tonsils
very
satisfying
pours
a
1
5
offwhite
head
bright
clear
but
iced
tea
brown
color
smells
like
a
wee
start
of
skunking
and
not
much
else
taste
is
very
mild
actually
kind
of
bmc
but
it
has
an
interesting
persistent
bitter
malt
after
taste
drinkable
but
not
really
a
standout
and
maybe
if
theyd
give
up
on
the
clear
glass
bottling
wed
have
something
else
to
smell
besides
the
early
road
to
skunking
still
it
was
a
bit
mediocre
lets
call
it
slightly
above
average
a
decent
ale
with
a
robust
malty
character
and
dry
bitterness
wellrounded
and
balanced
however
the
diacetyl
comes
across
as
a
flaw
albeit
not
an
unpleasant
one
this
ale
also
lacks
the
depth
that
live
conditioning
would
provide
worthy
but
not
worldclass
o
easy
drinker
and
very
sessionable
beer
better
than
i
remember
from
years
ago
i
will
have
to
see
if
i
can
find
this
from
cask
while
back
in
england
overall
sorry
i
simply
find
it
hard
to
get
around
ruddles
countys
metallurgic
aspirations
well
the
clear
glass
worries
me
a
bit
pours
a
fairly
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
stingy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
ring
the
initial
aroma
coming
out
of
the
first
pour
were
skunky
luckily
as
the
glass
sat
it
subsided
smells
of
butterscotch
caramel
and
toffee
very
sweet
smelling
with
a
little
earthy
mineral
bitterness
taste
follows
the
smell
fairly
well
but
the
skunk
came
back
sweet
and
malty
with
an
earthy
mineral
edge
moderate
carbonation
medium
body
with
a
sweet
bubbly
mineral
water
mouthfeel
the
mercaptan
killed
this
one
for
me
not
a
bad
brew
but
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
o
ruddles
county
esb
is
a
reasonably
good
example
of
a
traditional
british
cask
conditioned
bitter
you
could
certainly
do
better
and
when
presented
with
the
opportunity
look
elsewhere
in
a
pinch
though
this
will
get
the
job
done
overall
a
decent
beer
id
try
it
again
interesting
style
and
drinkable
o
not
particularly
enjoyable
or
drinkable
i
finished
my
halfpint
but
wouldnt
do
any
more
not
recommended
bitter
up
front
but
not
so
assertive
that
it
is
offputting
bread
toast
some
caramel
no
fruit
wood
some
raw
grain
toffee
and
this
is
all
pulled
together
by
the
bitterness
refreshing
and
drinkable
with
medium
body
and
appropriate
carbonation
a
very
solid
brew
likable
and
drinkable
and
worth
trying
d
a
good
beer
a
not
to
sweet
toffee
tasting
ale
with
a
nice
bitter
bite
a
real
beaut
in
the
glass
well
worth
a
try
m
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
malty
with
a
vengeance
a
good
start
but
there
were
other
offerings
that
i
liked
better
this
one
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
which
im
not
a
fan
of
due
to
quick
light
damage
but
luckily
the
particular
beer
im
drinking
is
quite
fresh
tasting
pours
a
nice
chestnut
color
with
a
finely
beaded
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
but
fades
a
little
too
quickly
nice
earthy
hop
smell
with
gentle
creamy
malt
and
some
butteriness
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
somewhat
more
resonant
hops
with
a
nice
lingering
grassy
and
earthy
bitterness
a
little
bit
of
nuttiness
on
the
finish
and
a
very
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
there
is
a
trace
of
copper
lurking
there
in
the
background
as
well
more
complex
than
it
seems
at
first
flush
this
ale
hangs
together
very
well
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
now
do
something
about
the
glass
bottle
dr
expensive
and
good
ruddles
in
the
pint
glass
looks
kinda
like
heaven
it
was
poured
expertly
and
the
liquid
is
a
light
shade
of
gold
mixed
in
with
some
yellow
the
head
is
an
inch
and
is
foamy
looking
and
perfect
smell
is
fairly
common
for
the
style
malts
are
up
front
and
pale
with
a
small
citrus
twist
that
is
light
a
simple
nose
for
a
simple
style
on
first
sips
or
gulps
rather
i
can
tell
this
one
is
a
winner
and
refreshing
i
hope
memphis
has
this
one
come
back
taste
of
pale
malts
accented
with
a
fairly
light
hopping
giving
off
slight
citrus
and
earthy
flavor
english
malts
bring
this
back
to
perspective
and
reminds
me
that
this
is
in
fact
english
all
the
way
feel
is
smooth
and
light
and
entirely
too
easy
to
drink
i
could
drinka
gallon
willingly
probably
my
favorite
bitter
so
far
in
a
style
not
favored
by
me
excellent
o
overall
i
totally
dug
this
brew
i
sucked
this
pint
down
like
a
boss
clear
amber
pour
with
a
one
finger
head
decent
retention
and
great
lacing
very
earthy
malt
nose
with
a
touch
of
skunkiness
theres
no
sign
of
the
skunkiness
in
the
taste
its
very
unique
with
a
hard
to
describe
kind
of
vegetable
taste
with
a
solid
malty
base
im
also
getting
some
tea
caramel
and
a
touch
of
peppery
bitter
hops
a
fruity
sweetness
adds
nice
balance
to
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
but
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
very
unique
and
surprising

had
this
on
cask
at
fountainhead
in
chicago
it
had
a
strong
toffee
caramel
taste
and
smell
with
hops
deep
in
the
background
to
provide
some
bitterness
on
the
finish
drinkability
was
off
the
charts
i
could
have
put
these
back
all
day
english
bitters
remain
some
of
my
favorite
beers
especially
when
theyre
on
cask
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
smooth
rich
buttery
goodness
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
just
dont
enjoy
it
that
much
enjoy
a
full
audio
review
of
this
beer
on
our
show

i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
nor
would
i
waanr
ro
go
back
and
pick
up
some
more
smooth
and
almost
buttery
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
in
the
aftertaste
the
hops
are
not
very
noticable
so
while
being
a
bitter
it
packs
no
real
punch
very
drinkable
beer
i
quite
like
it
pours
out
a
copper
colour
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
lasted
throughout
very
roasted
smell
with
some
butterscotch
and
toffee
some
bittering
hops
as
well
tasted
decent
and
sweet
some
caramel
and
butterscotch
ruled
with
a
bit
of
bittering
grassy
hops
in
the
foreground
great
session
beer
at
4
7
and
highly
drinkable
a
crystal
clear
english
bitter
with
a
rich
copper
look
that
has
a
good
head
the
dry
caramel
taste
is
unique
and
is
topped
off
with
a
nice
sharpe
bitter
hop
flavor
which
goes
down
smoothly
making
this
a
very
drinkable
and
freshen
beer
and
gives
this
bitter
a
decent
character
this
is
one
english
bitter
that
is
worth
trying
either
in
a
bottle
or
a
can
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
great
beer
hard
to
imagine
a
better
example
of
the
style
thanks
stu
be
careful
not
to
drink
this
too
cold
as
it
will
stifle
much
of
the
character
d
a
well
made
bitter
and
worth
a
try
dont
be
afraid
of
the
clear
bottle
this
bottle
has
no
sign
of
being
light
struck
overall
the
only
real
criticism
is
that
like
many
bottled
bitters
its
over
carbonated
for
the
style
perhaps
more
appropriate
to
an
american
style
still
a
bit
of
swirling
in
the
glass
to
remove
some
of
the
co2
does
wonders
otherwise
this
is
exactly
what
a
traditional
english
bitter
should
be
cricket
on
the
village
green
on
a
long
summer
evening
in
every
bottle
mouthfeeldrinkability
rolling
and
active
the
beers
texture
is
quite
lively
the
carbonation
level
begins
with
some
muscle
then
it
smooths
out
and
eases
nicely
right
through
to
the
finish
a
nice
example
of
a
classic
english
bitter
showcasing
the
hops
and
water
character
in
a
pronounced
assertive
beer
a
goodpleasant
interesting
ale
which
is
certainly
worth
another
try
and
i
can
imagine
in
its
day
this
ale
would
have
been
outstanding
i
just
think
however
it
lacks
the
balance
of
other
ales
brewed
by
the
same
brewery
the
drinkability
is
good
i
with
a
fount
it
on
cask
mk
overall
pretty
good
but
im
not
generally
a
fan
of
this
style
so
probably
wouldnt
have
again
definitely
worth
a
try
if
english
bitters
are
your
thing
though
this
is
a
very
traditional
interpretation
of
the
style
pretty
good
if
you
favor
an
english
bitter
not
so
good
if
you
prefer
something
less
traditional
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
clear
with
a
smallish
creamy
head
a
touch
of
lacing
the
retention
is
there
if
you
pour
the
bottle
upside
down
to
force
feed
the
carbonation
because
on
its
own
this
beer
is
pretty
flat
the
nose
and
taste
are
very
typical
old
fashioned
butterscotch
toffee
caramel
roasted
notes
there
is
a
particularly
drying
element
here
with
a
slightly
pungent
almost
lemony
mid
section
and
beyond
the
aftertaste
is
the
lingering
pungence
minus
the
better
parts
of
this
beer
im
just
not
sold
on
the
style
and
the
acerbic
stuff
in
this
beer
doesnt
do
it
for
me
pours
a
clear
redamber
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
pale
hops
slight
malt
yeast
and
some
grain
fits
the
style
of
an
english
bitter
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
hops
yeast
grain
and
slight
sweet
malt
overall
a
rather
average
english
bitter
nothing
really
stands
out
d
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
another
one
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
bronze
amber
color
with
a
soft
foamy
off
white
head
good
lacing
through
out
rich
malty
and
slight
sweet
grain
up
front
a
hint
of
fruit
in
the
mix
that
adds
to
the
sensation
on
the
taste
buds
the
mouthfeel
is
more
enjoyable
as
it
warms
nice
smooth
as
velvet
taste
in
the
finish
balanced
filling
and
flavorful
one
of
my
first
english
bitters
bring
more
on
on
the
whole
a
decent
beer
but
the
harshness
of
the
flavour
makes
this
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
after
a
rather
nondescript
start
there
is
a
pleasant
rather
herbal
hoppy
bite
followed
by
a
warmer
sweeter
hit
with
pleasant
vanilla
notes
it
seems
to
improve
as
it
warms
and
the
vanilla
flavour
settles
on
the
tongue
widely
available
on
cask
here
this
is
always
a
safe
bet
very
drinkable
beer
this
beer
was
clear
and
amber
with
a
thin
fizzy
beige
cap
of
bubbles
the
aroma
was
hoppy
with
notes
of
sulfur
and
grass
lemon
toasted
malt
a
little
buttery
bitterness
was
mild
to
moderate
and
the
aramel
sweetness
was
balanced
nicely
having
the
same
toasted
buttery
character
that
was
seen
in
the
aroma
hop
flavour
was
more
lemon
and
grass
than
sulfury
it
finished
with
lingering
bitterness
as
the
malt
faded
moderate
carbonation
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
bit
of
dryness
and
a
smooth
nearly
coating
texture
good
stuff
and
an
easy
drinking
bitter
nothing
spectacular
here
but
its
a
solid
beer
not
a
big
fan
of
greene
king
but
i
admit
this
is
better
than
their
average
offering
a
good
easydrinking
bitter
this
poured
an
orange
amber
color
with
a
massive
frothy
coke
floatlike
of
a
head
a
few
streams
of
light
carbonation
travels
to
the
top
aroma
is
of
wood
apples
pear
tea
and
caramel
this
is
a
very
malty
doughy
beer
the
hop
flavor
is
more
in
the
background
and
the
bitterness
is
light
sweet
malt
and
brown
sugar
flavor
dominates
the
feel
medium
and
smooth
this
is
very
drinkable
the
general
flavor
reminds
me
of
old
speckled
hen
except
this
is
cleaner
not
skunky
and
doesnt
have
that
nasty
harsh
ass
flavor
to
it
very
drinkable
conclusion
this
is
kind
of
muted
and
definitely
past
its
prime
friar
tuck
has
been
horrible
about
keeping
their
english
imports
for
a
long
time
and
not
restocking
lately
therefore
the
flavors
are
kind
of
muted
and
muddled
still
not
bad
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
sample
a
decent
example
that
loses
something
from
being
in
a
clear
bottle
otherwise
mildly
drinkable
and
you
could
session
a
few
of
these
if
it
came
in
cans
it
would
be
even
better
this
beer
pours
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
minimum
of
head
that
becomes
a
thin
layer
stretched
across
the
top
of
the
beer
smells
a
little
roasty
and
a
little
fruity
with
some
spiciness
in
the
background
tastes
very
malty
and
estery
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
but
not
enough
to
keep
it
from
finishing
rather
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
and
a
little
fizzy
not
bad
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
english
bitter
not
really
a
session
beer
but
a
special
occasion
beer
didnt
really
care
for
this
beer
it
seemed
like
just
another
english
ale
nothing
terrible
to
say
but
wont
be
revisiting
it
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
had
a
great
frothy
head
that
was
pretty
the
beer
was
a
nice
caramel
color
but
it
had
a
big
fruity
loud
smell
it
was
very
floral
smelling
also
the
taste
was
a
bit
malty
and
bitter
the
lacing
was
extremely
good
the
head
was
gone
very
fast
i
would
try
this
beer
again
in
hope
i
could
get
a
fresher
taste
this
was
poured
from
1
pt
09
oz
clear
bottle
with
a
marking
of
gk992791
it
is
mostly
orangecopper
in
tone
with
a
decent
foamy
beige
head
i
immediately
catch
a
wafting
aroma
of
malts
hops
and
something
slightly
fruity
it
is
bold
and
full
bodied
on
the
tongue
and
the
fine
bitterness
takes
over
the
flavor
the
hops
are
noticeable
and
not
overzealous
like
in
an
ipa
i
was
impressed
with
this
sampling
d
low
abv
and
super
refreshment
great
session
the
clear
bottle
made
me
a
little
nervous
but
the
beer
turned
out
to
be
pretty
good
i
think
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
as
well
its
a
very
sessionable
beer
thats
bitter
without
packing
a
huge
punch
which
is
pretty
much
what
a
bitter
is
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
someday
recommended
given
that
this
is
a
clear
bottled
import
the
beer
may
not
have
been
at
its
freshest
but
was
still
good
quite
raw
in
its
flavour
and
bitterness
makes
many
of
the
australian
brewed
bitters
seem
rather
tame
truly
a
wellbalanced
easy
drinking
sessionable
english
ale
nice
hop
touch
taste
more
than
aroma
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
cask
overall
apparently
this
beer
tastes
like
toffee
but
it
certainly
didnt
seem
that
way
to
me
ill
pass
on
this
one
drinkability
this
was
my
second
beer
during
this
trip
to
the
old
toad
with
my
first
being
greene
king
abbot
ale
while
both
beers
were
very
drinkable
i
actually
found
the
ruddles
county
to
be
a
slightly
better
beer
in
terms
of
drinkability
mfd
medium
bodied
ale
i
got
the
strong
feeling
on
carbonation
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
very
drinkable
i
want
more
already
an
old
school
bitter
ale
that
tastes
great
and
has
outstanding
drinkability
definately
worth
its
following
im
glad
that
i
stumbled
upon
it
and
plan
on
having
more
in
the
future
highly
recommended
drinkability
more
of
the
same
here
i
loved
the
canned
version
and
will
continue
my
search
for
that
it
looks
like
the
bottle
is
not
the
way
i
will
search
for
more
of
this
this
was
the
last
bottle
at
the
store
as
well
so
much
for
finding
this
one
again
for
now
it
has
potential
id
love
to
try
the
canned
version
ruddles
county
once
ruddles
of
rutland
but
now
it
appears
to
be
consolidated
with
other
breweries
from
different
areas
was
one
of
the
icons
of
the
camra
revolution
in
the
early
seventies
i
was
interested
to
evaluate
it
now
some
twenty
years
since
my
last
experience
in
a
clear
glass
bottle
you
can
see
the
reasonably
dark
amber
colour
the
nose
is
somewhat
fruity
malty
on
the
palate
is
where
it
counts
with
a
very
characteristic
hoppy
complex
dry
quite
bitter
long
after
taste
there
are
layers
underneath
that
you
dont
get
in
an
ordinary
beer
yes
you
could
still
pick
it
out
of
a
lineup
even
with
the
diversification
of
bottled
craft
brews
that
has
occured
in
recent
years
taste
is
mild
bitter
without
real
hoppiness
the
hops
are
earthy
and
low
aromatic
the
malt
is
light
caramellic
and
dextrinous
yeast
gives
fruity
notes
great
balance
body
is
quite
full
for
the
style
all
around
not
a
bad
beer
i
have
only
very
recently
started
appreciating
this
form
and
am
still
wht
some
would
consider
to
be
a
newbie
to
the
style
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
highly
drinkable
especially
for
the
price
d
highly
drinkable
a
good
bitter
at
any
time
and
sure
fire
bet
for
session
drinking
poured
from
the
clear
yeah
clear
500ml
bottle
a
clear
amber
brown
with
a
wimpy
white
head
not
a
bad
3ish
pint
o
brew
worth
a
try
down
the
road
this
beer
was
sampled
from
a
50
cl
bottle
that
i
bought
at
the
local
grocery
store
its
a
goodlooking
beer
rich
brownamber
in
color
mostly
clear
and
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
great
most
notable
is
a
generous
smell
of
fuggles
its
like
sniffing
a
bag
of
hop
pellets
behind
the
hops
is
a
slight
biscuit
toast
and
modest
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
mediumdry
with
a
nice
balance
between
malt
flavor
and
hops
nice
bitterness
theres
some
toffee
and
a
little
caramel
in
there
as
well
medium
body
and
mediumlow
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
pleasant
flavorful
drinking
beer
much
better
than
i
expected
also
despite
the
clear
bottle
theres
little
sign
of
age
in
the
one
i
tried
the
hops
smell
kind
of
herbal
and
tasted
that
way
too
mouthfeel
was
thicker
than
i
expected
but
not
in
a
particularly
bad
way
i
seemed
to
perceive
the
alcohol
more
than
i
would
have
liked
however
still
pretty
drinkable
though
creamy
and
light
and
moderate
bitterness
what
you
want
in
a
sessionable
ale
would
go
nicely
with
lunch
easy
drinking
though
not
the
boldest
taste
and
so
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
on
cask
or
in
a
can
inoffensive
on
tap
would
be
the
way
to
go
bramling
cross
hops
pours
a
strong
hay
amber
with
very
lazy
bubbles
taking
their
sweet
time
hitting
my
every
constant
head
excellent
retention
for
a
canned
english
ale
with
no
widget
the
aroma
is
a
very
light
pine
and
resin
aroma
but
overall
very
clean
the
taste
has
a
slight
tinny
malt
with
some
rather
assertive
english
hops
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
a
little
little
creamy
thanks
in
part
to
the
head
very
easy
drinking
beer
a
very
nice
bitter
indeed
it
is
balanced
and
steady
making
it
a
very
sessionable
eer
should
you
be
lucky
enough
to
have
it
at
your
local
pours
from
the
tall
green
can
a
bright
copper
color
with
very
little
head
the
brewers
description
written
on
the
can
hits
it
right
on
the
nose
robust
hoppy
flavor
with
a
delicate
smoothness
admirable
mouthfeel
and
outstanding
drinkability
pity
about
the
mouthfeel
it
ruined
the
drink
for
me
i
will
not
be
having
a
bottle
again
but
will
try
a
cask
pint
if
i
see
one
on
my
travels
nice
session
beer
but
like
like
so
many
others
from
the
uk
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
itd
probably
be
a
lot
more
enjoyable
fresh
still
it
doesnt
fall
into
any
of
the
traps
that
your
average
imported
esb
does
and
for
that
i
give
it
a
fairly
high
mark
d
i
only
got
one
pint
can
in
my
sample
pack
but
i
could
have
a
few
more
of
these
and
i
will
seek
it
out
as
a
possible
session
beer
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
an
ambercopper
color
with
a
halfinch
off
white
head
it
mostly
smells
like
grassy
hops
and
bready
malt
and
some
butterscotch
too
the
taste
is
bready
malt
and
toffee
with
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
that
doesnt
linger
for
too
long
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
not
much
carbonation
and
a
lightmedium
body
drinkability
is
good
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
this
as
an
occasional
session
beer
id
drink
this
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
an
english
bitter
of
all
the
many
styles
of
the
world
im
sure
these
kind
of
english
beers
are
absolutely
among
the
worst
affected
by
being
put
in
cans
why
it
kills
the
body
nulls
the
flavours
and
counters
all
the
quintessentials
of
the
style
the
can
does
no
good
for
these
kind
of
beers
and
this
is
one
of
many
ive
tried
lately
that
i
could
see
being
quite
nice
if
it
were
alive
if
it
were
fresh
if
it
were
hand
pumped
from
the
source
but
as
it
is
here
in
front
of
me
this
is
nothing
but
subpar
very
subpar
a
sad
case
overall
impression
strongly
slanted
towards
the
english
hop
bitterness
which
detracts
somewhat
from
the
overall
sessionability
the
haze
suggests
a
clarity
or
handling
problem
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
nothing
too
offensive
make
sure
you
like
your
english
hop
varieties
fuggles
i
think
before
you
sit
down
with
a
pint
of
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
still
very
good
first
time
i
tasted
it
i
had
it
with
a
couple
of
stouts
youngs
double
chocolate
and
others
and
it
really
kicked
the
other
beers
asses
i
thought
back
then
now
im
not
so
sure
a
very
loveable
beer
under
any
circumstances
this
remarkably
clear
ale
looks
good
too
with
an
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
lacework
overall
ruddles
is
good
bitter
stuff
notes
pours
a
copperamber
colour
with
a
nice
head
steady
retention
and
bubbles
form
around
the
glass
good
strong
aromas
of
molasses
maple
syrup
and
hop
taste
is
nice
and
powerful
some
fruit
mixed
in
with
some
caramel
the
bold
bitterness
of
the
hop
kicks
in
a
notch
more
in
the
finish
and
smooth
out
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
not
as
good
as
the
caskconditioned
ruddles
county
but
still
a
great
bitter
ale
notes
i
thought
it
was
ok
overall
id
much
rather
have
this
than
alot
of
canned
english
offerings
that
make
their
way
over
here
this
is
a
unique
and
drinkable
cask
brew
super
drinkable
and
the
best
beer
out
of
a
can
i
have
tried
from
england
yet
mild
and
honest
to
god
tasty
superior
to
boddingtons
in
every
way
far
better
than
i
expected
not
just
another
mediocre
english
bitter
in
a
can
overall
i
first
drank
ruddles
county
drank
way
back
in
the
mid
to
late
80s
at
that
time
you
had
to
travel
to
the
south
of
england
to
sample
its
delights
it
was
a
strong
cask
ale
that
had
a
great
often
legendary
following
at
that
time
the
version
i
just
tried
from
the
bottle
is
maybe
a
tidied
variant
now
contract
brewed
by
greene
king
d
low
alcohol
and
light
body
make
this
what
it
is
designed
to
be
a
great
session
beer
very
drinkable
pouring
lightly
down
the
side
its
quickly
evident
that
im
not
raising
a
head
i
shift
the
glass
to
vertical
and
dump
away
im
rewarded
with
a
one
finger
head
along
with
a
nice
cascade
effect
this
is
not
nitro
the
head
quickly
disperses
into
a
nice
thin
layer
of
light
tan
foam
leaving
thick
lacing
held
up
to
a
light
the
body
is
a
bright
copper
the
aroma
is
quite
distinctive
and
apparent
from
the
moment
i
cracked
the
bottle
it
has
a
musty
biscuity
english
smell
to
it
and
a
rich
potent
hop
presence
as
well
tasting
while
admittedly
still
too
cold
i
find
a
mild
slightly
fruity
very
satisfying
taste
it
has
notes
of
caramel
toffee
the
hops
dont
show
too
much
in
flavor
but
they
do
in
a
slight
but
growing
bitterness
not
very
sweet
just
balanced
medium
body
and
low
carb
make
it
very
smooth
this
bitter
really
works
for
me
taste
was
initially
a
bit
metallic
but
that
subsided
quickly
leaving
a
slightly
sweet
and
hoppy
flavor
impressingly
smooth
going
down
for
a
bitter
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
english
bitter
poured
a
deep
rustred
in
a
pint
glass
looked
really
nice
except
i
was
dissapointed
in
the
head
14
inch
or
so
and
minimal
lacing
carbonation
appeared
low
the
smell
was
mild
but
was
nice
and
sweet
the
taste
is
that
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
welcome
hops
bitterness
at
the
end
very
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
it
goes
down
well
though
i
like
the
taste
i
can
see
the
almost
syrupy
sweetness
of
the
beer
becoming
too
much
for
me
after
a
few
but
a
good
ale
none
the
less
d
high
this
is
a
bottoms
up
beer
easily
done
in
this
nice
pint
sized
literally
bottle
great
on
a
porch
after
a
hot
sweaty
day
odd
shaped
wide
mouth
500ml
clear
glass
bottle
pours
a
medium
copper
with
a
fine
rocky
head
and
plenty
of
stickiness
in
the
glass
smell
is
lightly
malted
with
hops
peeking
through
and
a
mild
grassy
nutty
touch
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
sweetness
and
hops
with
the
hops
winning
in
the
end
these
are
not
citrusy
hops
these
are
truly
bitter
attacking
but
not
overwhelming
the
taste
buds
in
the
rear
of
the
tongue
this
is
a
lightbodied
brew
though
it
never
tastes
completely
watery
again
i
believe
due
to
the
hops
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
a
bit
pricey
for
the
abv
i
paid
4
00
for
the
bottle
decent
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
anything
all
that
special
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
and
a
bit
under
carbonated
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
to
spend
a
day
with
in
some
ancient
pub
in
rural
england
good
if
you
like
the
style
this
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
like
the
color
of
a
new
lincoln
penny
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
16
9
ounce
clear
bottle
mild
but
pleasant
malt
aroma
taste
is
more
aggressively
hopped
than
i
expected
but
not
unbalanced
yes
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
im
sure
i
will
drink
this
again
a
friend
whos
big
into
english
beers
wanted
me
to
try
this
i
think
im
more
of
a
samuel
smith
man
but
this
wasnt
bad
it
was
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
small
creamcolored
head
it
had
a
fresh
outdoors
odor
the
taste
was
mild
malty
with
some
hops
afterwards
fairly
pleasant
quite
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
arouse
any
passion
this
is
a
substandard
bitter
it
needs
less
butter
and
more
hops
very
clear
with
reddish
copper
color
a
small
minus
for
the
quickdisappearing
head
nice
alearoma
with
a
hint
of
hops
tastes
as
it
smells
malt
is
noticeable
maybe
a
bit
thin
but
very
good
some
hops
in
the
after
taste
which
is
nice
a
distinct
absence
of
sweetness
pretty
good
stuff
ho
hum
notes
just
another
english
bitter
not
much
to
say
about
it
alright
i
admit
it
i
bought
it
because
of
the
bottle
it
was
neat
did
not
realize
it
was
a
bitter
until
i
sipped
it
and
pop
hops
nice
wallop
of
christmas
tree
hops
across
the
tongue
but
it
was
wierd
the
hop
flavor
does
not
linger
until
i
ran
my
tongue
around
my
mouth
a
bit
and
i
find
the
hops
oils
are
really
stuck
on
the
tongue
but
coming
through
all
those
hops
is
a
nice
baselayer
of
malts
that
help
hold
this
beer
together
poured
a
clear
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
left
stringy
lace
all
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
canned
sample
light
amber
in
colour
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
some
fruity
malt
aromas
along
with
some
earthy
hops
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
to
keep
things
in
check
with
some
pleasent
malt
dark
fruit
licorice
and
caramel
flavors
full
mouthfeel
a
solid
session
bitter
but
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
could
get
a
little
boring
to
drink
after
a
while
mouthfeel
drinkability
with
good
depth
and
nice
flavour
but
not
over
the
top
this
beer
is
a
mediumbodied
brew
full
of
pleasant
elements
of
a
wellbalanced
english
premium
bitter
very
quaffable
and
mellow
a
competent
ale
not
to
blow
your
socks
off
but
worth
a
try
odd
bottle
pulltop
lid
and
a
very
wide
mouth
color
reddishcopper
clear
with
a
slight
head
light
hop
aroma
not
really
identifiable
taste
is
a
pleasant
mixture
of
very
lightly
caramel
malt
and
moderately
bitter
grassy
hops
nice
dryish
finish
body
is
fairly
light
and
carbonation
just
on
the
low
side
of
medium
a
good
solid
english
bitter
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
this
brew
is
chewy
but
it
isnt
thin
or
weak
either
lightmedium
bodied
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
full
of
basic
malt
and
hops
flavor
nicely
balanced
and
perfect
for
the
style
i
can
see
myself
mellowing
out
with
a
couple
bottles
of
ruddles
county
on
my
next
day
off
pours
a
warm
orange
color
with
a
generous
head
that
takes
a
good
bit
of
time
to
die
down
the
smell
is
weak
with
no
distinguished
tastes
jumping
out
the
taste
itself
is
much
like
any
other
english
bitter
although
there
is
a
little
more
hops
than
normal
for
sure
this
is
best
served
at
room
temperature
and
out
of
a
tap
the
head
and
smell
of
this
beer
were
nothing
special
although
ill
take
it
over
most
domestic
stuff
im
a
big
cask
ale
fan
and
this
was
one
i
had
a
few
times
while
in
england
on
vacation
it
was
lighter
than
other
bitters
i
had
but
it
went
well
with
fish
chips
and
steak
pie
it
didnt
fill
me
up
like
a
few
other
cask
ales
i
prefer
but
quite
a
nice
option
if
youre
in
a
pub
and
looking
for
a
good
guest
ale
it
appears
that
the
top
does
not
work
that
well
either
as
the
beer
poured
very
flat
very
little
head
nice
ruby
red
color
perfectly
clear
but
a
bigger
concern
is
the
fact
that
when
opened
i
could
smell
a
massive
hit
of
skunk
clear
bottle
odd
seal
is
not
a
good
combination
for
a
low
alcohol
fairly
highly
hopped
ale
nice
malty
flavor
just
barley
noticeable
beneath
the
skunk
but
not
a
very
good
english
mildbitter
ale
small
fine
bubbled
bright
white
head
fades
quickly
to
a
film
almost
transparent
deep
copper
colored

very
inviting
floral

aroma
hop
tea
flavor
rides
over
a
mildly
sweet
malt
base
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
with
the
flavors
it
comes
off
just
right
damn
tasty
decent
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
probably
better
on
tap
drinkability
flavor
is
different
enough
to
warrant
some
caution
but
expands
nicely
as
it
warms
quite
good
but
need
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
this
one

moderate

lovely
hoppy
aroma
hints
of
ripe

and
caramel
bramling
cross

account
for
a
distinct

and
aftertaste
quite
dry
id
like
some
more
malts
to
balance
the
hops
but
thats
the
style
i
guess
still
this
is
a
nice
beer
will
definitely
buy
again
never
again
pretty
rough
stuff
overall
smooth
smooth
smooth
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
english
ale
loaded
with
flavor
an
incredibly
quaffable
beer
though
a
bit
pricey
highly
recommended
these
english
pub
ales
are
growing
on
me
ruddles
county
does
most
everything
right
and
was
a
pleasure
to
consume
i
bought
this
on
my
most
recent
trip
to
ohio
i
dont
believe
that
ive
seen
it
around
here
if
i
run
across
it
locally
ill
definitely
buy
it
again
good
stuff
poured
from
the
nitro

this
beer
has
a
deep
copper
color
and
a
nice
reverse
cascading
effect
it
forms
to
a
quite
persistent
2
finger

aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet

and
flowery

begins
sligtly
sweet
then
becomes
very
pleasantly
bitter
some

as
well
a
herbal
and
floral

mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
very
low
carbonation
per
the

widget
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
a
nitro
can
it
almost
made
me
think
i
was
drinking
a
cask
ale
mmmm
a
real
nice

24
of
these
without
a

solid
i
like
this
one
if
the
first
wave
of
flavours
had
been
a
little
more
abstemious
and
thus
made
it
a
little
more
drinkable
i
would
maybe
even
have
given
it
a
5
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
gritty
and
powdery
but
the
drinkability
is
great

a

certainly
make
this

this
came
in
a
cool
halfpint
clear

with
an
oldfashioned
metal
pull
tab
the
aromas
were
a
bit
skunky
damn
but
the
nice
biscuity
maltiness
shined
through
anyway
the
taste
was
quite
malty
with
some
nice
floral
hops
in
the
middle
and
a
lovely
finish
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
grainy
creamy
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
great
as
well
probably
unreal
on
cask
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
lace

the
aroma
is
good
it
has
all
the
english
ale
qualities
its
bitter

creamy
with
a
mild
aroma
hopping
the
taste
is
not
bad
it
is
bitter
and
creamy
with
a
malty
flavor
it
finishes
watery
a
product
i
think
is
from
the
clear
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
above
average
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
below
average
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
english
ale
it
has
some
faults
but
not
enough
to
keep
me
away

nice

and
an
excellent

the
only
way
to
improve
this
would
be
to
knock
back
the
hops
a
bit
and
this
would
be
outstanding
pours
a
clear
pale
copper
a
bit
lighter
than
i
remember
proper
bitters
being
the
head
was
thin

pretty
quickly

just
spotty

quite

again
and
hop
in
the
back
medium
body
when
i
poured
this
i
could
barely
extract
a
head
weird
for
an
english
ale
then
i
smelled
it
and
it
seemed
very
hoppy
the
taste
left
me
with
a
grimace
maybe
this
beer
was
slightly
too
old
or
the
container
was
not
correct
being
clear
and
all
led
to
a
bad
beer
anyways
it
tasted
extremely
hoppy
but
sour
at
the
same
time
almost
like
a
rotten
tarty
fruit
pretty
dry
finish
my
tastebuds
got
more
used
to
it
the
more
i
drank
but
not
good

werent
3
bucks
a
pop
i
could
drink
any
number
of
them
ng
dont
know
why
i
havent
tried
this
before
but
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
reminds
me
of
the
bitters
i
had
in
london
orangey
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
hoppy
and
grassy
very
clean
flavor
is
sweet
malt
with
some
hints
of
corn
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
subtle
malty
finish
very
good
all
around
a
pretty
good
english
ale
much
better
casked
or
in
the
bottle
i
wish
i
could
find
this
on
regular
tap
because
the
nitro
while
smooth
kills
so
much
of
the
flavor
and
the
beer
is
very
delicate
to
begin
with
came
in
a
500
ml
green
can
freshness
date
on
bottom
only
2
weeks
past
it
pours
out
a
very
appealing
clear
amberish
orange
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
capping
it
off
leaves
some
massive
walls
of
lace
in
its
wake
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
toffee
a
bit
nutty
if
not
entirely
crazy
even
the
scent
of
raisins
is
in
there
rounded
off
by
very
floral
hops
big
hop
flavour
all
the
way
around
it
crowds
out
everything
else
surprising
for
such
a
mild
and
complex
nose
a
bit
of
raisin
on
the
aftertaste
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
real
british
pale
ale
that
packs
a
whallop
while
going
down
easy
all
the
same
definitely
worth
going
back
for
more
this
brew
poured
a
medium
foamy
head
of
fine
offwhite
bubbles
and
a
carbonated
slightly
dark
amber
colored
body
it
has
a
malthopfloral
aroma
with
a
slightly
chewy
hopbread
flavor
that
starts
out
smooth
and
ends
with
a
lingering
slight
bitter
aftertaste
it
leave
a
most
excellent
clinging
vine
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
mug
when
you
tip
it
that
never
disappeared
and
covered
the
entire
side
of
the
mug
one
of
the
best
lacings
i
have
seen
in
a
brew
can
this
brew
poured
an
offwhite
longlasting
creamy
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
the
lacing
was
excellent
but
it
did
not
last
long
it
had
a
spicy
nose
in
my
opinion
there
was
no
carbonation
present
the
hue
was
orangish
this
brew
was
definitely
bitter
tasting
and
it
also
had
a
lingering
aftertaste
to
it
another
sample
from
the
ale
marys
line
up
seebeerfly
poured
a
deep
copperorange
with
a
fair
bit
of
fog
and
a
fluffy
thick
white
head
the
smell
was
average
at
best
and
not
too
much
interesting
poking
out
the
taste
was
good
though
with
sweet
citrus
hops
balanced
with
a
scotchy
malts
flavor
for
an
interesting
blend
not
too
often
found
in
a
bitter
it
warmed
me
up
on
an
all
too
cold
spring
evening
and
did
not
overwhelm
me
in
the
bitterness
quality
brew
moderately
dry
and
with
a
moderately
long
finish
this
combined
with
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
to
help
create
great
drinkability
to
me
a
mushroom
and
fruit
burp
i
like
this
beer
its
great
to
have
at
a
real
pub
i
really
really
wish
americans
were
into
bitters
like
the
brits
so
beers
like
these
could
be
more
available
on
tap
anyway
i
have
it
in
my
head
that
this
is
such
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
am
always
a
little
let
down
when
i
taste
it
maybe
i
am
holding
on
too
tightly
to
my
first
wonderful
memory
of
ruddles
as
its
available
now
in
this
country
it
certainly
leaves
something
to
be
desired
those
clear
widemouth
milk
bottles
dont
do
the
beer
any
favors
and
the
nitro
cans
are
a
joke
an
imported
cask
didnt
rock
my
world
either
i
guess
someday
i
will
have
to
journey
to
the
brewery
and
try
it
at
the
source
or
maybe
the
rumors
are
true
and
this
beer
has
already
changed
and
the
beer
i
am
dreaming
about
no
longer
exists
premium
ale
cloudy
copper
at
first
under
a
frothy
cascading
head
when
the
head
settles
on
top
the
copper
color
clears
and
intensifies
not
much
aroma
mild
tea
sweet
malt
damp
cellar
amply
malted
and
more
than
amply
hopped
with
tealike
and
light
citrus
bitterness
some
backofthethroat
harshness
i
like
it
smooth
mouthfeel
drinkable
nothing
special
perhaps
id
try
this
again
in
the
bottle
or
on
draught
but
never
more
in
the
nitro
can
color
was
a
dark
amber
brown
very
thick
white
head
about
a
finger
high
smells
very
dry
right
from
the
start
with
a
strange
musty
old
cloth
aroma
some
floral
hops
sweet
citrus
and
bitterness
taste
was
very
dried
out
and
a
little
empty
lots
of
floral
hopiness
and
citrusy
bitterness
clean
and
smooth
but
lacking
i
know
its
suppose
to
be
a
bitter
style
that
it
was
but
the
overall
dryness
in
the
taste
and
feel
was
a
little
much
for
me
it
took
a
while
to
get
use
to
but
once
i
was
used
to
it
i
liked
it
not
bad
just
a
tad
overbearing
on
the
dryness
similar
in
flavor
to
the
bottled
version
but
overall
a
more
rounded
and
smoother
flavor
of
the
two
packages
i
have
tried
i
would
opt
for
the
nitro
can
everytime
this
ale
poured
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
creamy
white
foam
characteristic
of
a
cask
pull
the
foam
left
some
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
modest
mild
hops
and
some
malt
the
taste
was
not
strong
malt
and
hops
with
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
and
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
clean
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
a
rather
straightforward
english
bitter
notes
ive
always
enjoyed
the
500ml
can
as
it
perfectly
fills
a
pint
glass
with
just
enough
room
for
the
proper
head
this
definitely
is
a
pleasant
down
at
the
pub
ale
it
has
a
real
old
timey
thing
going
on
its
unrefined
honest
and
meant
for
a
session
i
think
ill
pour
me
another
right
now
nice
looking
brew
pours
out
to
a
mediumamber
color
with
a
thick
pancaky
offwhite
head
atop
microscopic
bubbles
leaving
good
clumps
of
lace
carbonation
is
very
mild
aroma
is
unique
with
tons
of
butterscotch
toffee
burnt
caramel
marshmallows
and
nothing
else
probably
the
strongest
diacetyl
ive
smelled
in
a
beer
taste
is
pleasantly
mild
with
a
bright
fresh
and
wellbalanced
malt
body
and
hop
zing
fading
into
a
tolerable
metallic
offnote
and
ending
in
a
smooth
very
dry
and
supremely
mild
round
englishhop
bitterness
with
more
butterscotch
and
bready
toasty
malts
the
aroma
was
a
little
offputting
at
first
but
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
a
welldone
british
mild
odd
looking
clear
short
fat
12
oz
bottle
with
a
pull
tab
looks
like
an
iced
tea
bottle
clear
copper
color
thin
rocky
head
no
staying
power
smell
was
acidic
herbal
and
more
than
a
little
medicinal
sp
taste
was
higly
hopped
tart
and
super
bitter
just
what
you
would
expect
from
a
bitter
some
serious
earthy
qualities
to
it
grass
and
grainy
touch
to
the
end
not
alot
of
malt
presence
no
biscuit
like
tastes
that
would
make
it
outstanding
thin
and
watery
feel
a
bit
hot
on
the
finish
justifies
the
lower
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
however
and
great
with
a
hearty
meal
or
as
marathon
session
beer
quite
nice
ale
whith
a
mediumbrown
color
not
much
of
a
head
at
all
i
tried
making
a
big
one
but
wasnt
able
to
it
has
a
quite
hoppy
smell
with
a
very
nice
touch
of
dried
prune
and
fig
the
taste
is
dry
bready
and
bit
bitter
i
liked
it
though
easy
to
drink
imho
thanks
to
the
coat
of
arms
in
portsmouth
for
another
fine
cask
ale
pale
orange
in
color
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
seem
to
last
the
smell
was
citrus
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
starts
off
with
malt
but
moves
on
very
quickly
to
the
hops
and
bitterness
the
citrus
taste
is
present
throughout
i
have
been
to
london
three
times
and
this
one
brings
me
back
if
we
only
had
more
pubs
in
the
us
that
offered
cask
ales
overall
a
nice
bitter
a
sorta
going
down
to
the
pub
with
me
mates
to
play
a
little
snooker
type
bitter
see
notes
on
the
bottle
below
i
am
surprised
that
the
can
tastes
as
good
as
it
does
i
ordered
it
as
a
substitute
for
the
outofstock
bottles
and
it
is
the
exact
same
material
only
with
a
slight
harshness
on
the
finish
the
carbonation
is
another
clear
difference
maybe
the
bubbles
were
masking
the
somewhat
assertive
hop
bitterness
still
a
bitter
that
lives
up
to
its
name
looks
good
moderate
carbonation
definitely
has
character
and
they
use
only
the
four
basic
ingredients
of
beer
but
it
is
complex
tasting
anyway
but
the
brewer
uses
too
many
hops
that
just
keep
on
going
i
was
quite
surprised
by
two
things
in
this
beer
one
that
it
wasnt
skunked
clear
bottle
and
two
that
it
was
so
good
clear
very
deep
ambercopper
almost
orangebrown
in
color
the
head
is
a
frothy
light
tan
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
an
exceptional
lace
throughout
the
pint
the
aroma
offers
a
light
sulphur
not
enough
to
be
distracting
some
grassy
earthy
citrusy
lemony
hops
and
an
odd
but
interesting
mustiness
im
not
sure
where
the
musty
character
might
be
coming
from
yeast
house
character
and
yet
the
sulphur
and
mustiness
that
i
would
normally
regard
as
defect
seem
interesting
and
exciting
the
body
is
medium
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
the
flavor
offers
an
initial
sweet
maltiness
ripe
with
caramel
toffee
as
well
as
a
buttery
note
diacetyl
another
normally
considered
defect
that
seems
to
work
here
then
revealing
a
good
amount
of
grassy
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
the
finish
is
dryish
and
lingering
with
a
gentle
matliness
and
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
becomes
quite
lemony
at
points
id
love
to
know
what
hops
theyre
using
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
english
best
bitter
rich
quite
complex
and
moderate
in
alcohol
at
4
7
this
offers
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
several
in
a
night
and
yet
its
full
of
flavor
its
somewhat
rich
but
not
so
much
so
that
it
becomes
overwhelming
massively
enjoyable
an
average
english
bitter
slightly
perfumy
hops
in
the
aroma
generally
dry
with
a
bitter
finish
tasty
but
quite
thin
in
body
i
think
it
would
be
good
for
session
drinking
ok
but
nothing
insane
ive
always
been
suspicious
of
reviews
that
throw
around
the
word
complex
smooth
and
rewarding
with
a
distinctive
hoppy
flavor
this
is
nice
mellow
brew
a
fairly
average
mass
produced
pint
not
too
heavily
hopped
ok
for
a
sandwich
and
a
pint
in
the
pub
at
lunchtime
but
nothing
special
bottle
500ml
frankly
not
the
best
beer
ive
drank
doesnt
really
shine
lots
of
crystal
malt
flavor
up
front
the
body
seems
flat
even
for
a
cask
conditioned
beer
little
hopthis
is
very
much
improperly
namedi
think
british
mild
not
ipa
as
a
mild
it
is
mediocre
as
an
ipa
it
clearly
misses
the
mark
i
know
what
i
drinkand
this
is
so
bad
avoid
o
reviewed
from
notes
on
8213
overall
meh
i
would
not
come
back
to
this
well
again
meh
a
pretty
bog
standard
bitter
from
one
of
the
biggest
ale
brewers
in
the
uk
not
much
cop
as
an
ipa
and
even
taken
as
a
bitter
its
bland
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
uninspired
mild
hop
notes
and
a
crisp
but
understated
bitterness
the
relatively
low
carbonation
is
ok
though
the
body
could
be
thicker
decent
balance
this
is
drinkable
and
id
turn
to
it
in
an
emergency
but
its
dull
fare
no
need
to
seek
it
out
overall
this
beer
is
ok
rubbish
compared
with
other
good
bitters
though
a
good
medium
alcohol
brew
decent
and
british
o
i
know
the
style
is
mild
but
this
is
just
too
featureless
my
for
taste
poured
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
small
cap
of
foamy
white
head
not
too
aromatic
scents
of
pale
malts
and
grassy
hops
simple
taste
a
bit
watery
light
biscuity
malts
bitter
grassy
hops
some
earthiness
thin
and
not
too
interesting
overall
a
problem
i
have
with
many
british
beers
light
mouthfeel
bitter
aftertaste
fairly
drinkable
not
entirely
bad
but
really
not
my
thing
i
like
cask
beers
but
if
you
call
yourself
an
ipa
i
need
bitter
hops
and
some
sort
of
a
kick
lighter
brown
with
a
thin
loose
foam
light
scent
of
citrus
orange
apple
from
the
hops
maybe
some
malt
taste
is
light
malt
and
hops
some
caramel
biscuit
and
i
get
a
little
apple
at
the
finish
more
biscuit
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
very
minimal
but
its
a
cask
pour
overall
unexciting
light
session
beer
o
not
too
excited
about
this
one
at
a
whopping
3
6
you
could
session
this
quite
easily
i
will
be
moving
along
to
satisfy
my
tastebuds
ive
now
had
2
different
beers
from
greene
king
and
would
encourage
them
to
up
their
hop
quotient
o
a
flavoursome
session
ale
quite
delicate
in
profile
and
easy
to
drink
not
exactly
a
benchmark
ipa
but
decent
hop
flavours
nonetheless
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
comically
without
a
lot
of
character
still
very
drinkable
o
not
a
lot
to
this
and
not
all
that
bad
as
a
palate
changer
it
works
not
something
i
would
want
a
lot
of
but
it
works
in
some
odd
way
i
had
this
at
the
kings
arm
pub
in
greenwich
england
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
with
this
ipa
of
course
im
used
to
american
ipas
and
this
one
just
didnt
have
the
hops
i
was
expecting
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
were
both
very
light
what
flavor
there
was
was
a
bit
of
fruit
cheers
overall
sessionable
quite
drinkable
refreshing
amount
of
hops
flavor
makes
this
ipa
one
i
will
have
again
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
id
like
to
try
it
from
a
can
or
on
tap
next
time
pours
a
murky
orange
a
good
amount
of
foamy
whit
head
looks
pretty
good
smells
hoppy
not
particularly
hoppy
but
a
good
amount
of
citrus
o
the
nose
tastes
sweet
and
bitter
mild
hops
on
the
tongue
but
fairly
subtle
solid
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
definitely
benefits
from
cask
greene
kings
ipa
has
a
very
unique
smell
and
appearance
seemingly
poured
as
the
brewers
name
implies
with
a
tinge
of
greenish
color
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
it
is
definitely
hoppy
but
not
oppressive
i
appreciated
how
smooth
it
was
and
the
aroma
was
pleasant
as
well
nothing
special
while
it
first
touched
your
lips
but
the
aftertaste
was
highly
enjoyable
not
sure
how
this
would
taste
from
a
can
or
any
other
serving
type
but
if
you
can
find
a
bar
or
local
pub
with
this
on
tap
definitely
give
it
a
try
especially
if
you
can
appreciate
beers
from
the
uk
d
nice
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
could
very
well
be
a
session
beer
tasty
ipa
though
not
a
strong
one
a
good
beer
to
try
i
have
it
regularly
d
drinkable
but
not
a
great
ipa
there
seems
to
be
a
lack
of
bitterness
and
flavor
in
beers
served
in
southern
england
i
had
much
more
flavorful
and
hopped
beers
in
northern
uk
3
this
ipa
has
a
very
strong
malt
flavour
that
being
said
its
a
nice
one
you
can
taste
the
mashed
grains
in
the
body
its
smooth
and
very
nice
when
chilled
its
sweeter
than
what
i
like
but
this
is
a
confidently
produced
product
that
is
sure
to
make
some
people
very
satisfied
im
just
not
getting
much
in
way
of
hops
in
this
but
thats
okay
since
overall
it
is
quite
enjoyable
mfd
decent
carbonation
but
relatively
smooth
easily
drinkable
but
nothing
to
brag
about
not
bad
at
all
could
use
a
bit
more
work
to
get
it
more
within
the
bitteripa
range
but
still
a
fairly
sessionable
bitter
d
very
refreshing
d
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
as
for
ipas
ive
been
hop
beaten
for
years
so
this
is
a
change
but
welcome
cask
english
ipa
is
different
and
good
mediocre
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
again
would
choose
a
mixed
drink
or
water
if
this
was
all
there
was
on
offer
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
soft
and
simple
in
the
mouth
the
gentle
carbonation
withers
after
a
few
seconds
which
is
fine
for
this
delicate
approachable
style
ill
agree
this
is
more
an
english
bitter
than
an
ipa
it
drinks
so
smoothly
and
restrained
to
improve
this
nitrocan
was
a
little
over
carbonated
light
flavor
other
than
the
hop
notes
and
very
little
to
make
the
beer
stand
out
against
its
foes
there
are
a
lot
of
beers
to
choose
from
in
this
space
so
i
would
pass
on
it
d
i
personally
love
this
beer
and
have
been
drinking
it
for
years
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
you
dont
need
excessive
alcohol
and
brutally
strong
flavours
to
make
a
great
beer
i
can
understand
the
lower
ratings
from
the
american
drinkers
as
they
are
used
to
ipa
that
attacks
the
palete
with
an
onslaught
of
bitter
hops
but
that
is
not
what
the
english
ipas
are
about
try
it
and
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
an
easy
to
drink
english
ipa
also
a
word
of
warning
this
ipa
is
far
superior
on
cask
and
bottle
in
comparison
to
cans
i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
the
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
but
overall
it
is
a
decent
brew
unfortunately
for
it
i
know
better
bitters
and
ipas
for
its
price
point
here
after
two
weeks
in
the
balkins
i
had
a
layover
in
london
i
had
enough
of
euro
pale
ales
and
wanted
something
hoppier
and
something
with
flavor
in
short
i
wanted
a
good
ipa
the
first
english
pub
i
saw
had
this
in
cask
and
i
thought
i
had
found
my
answer
i
was
slightly
mistaken
this
was
not
like
an
american
ipa
it
was
served
at
room
temp
which
can
be
expected
in
england
it
had
no
head
but
it
looked
the
right
color
for
an
ipa
it
just
did
not
impress
me
with
the
flavor
there
was
not
much
hop
flavor
in
it
it
is
drinkable
but
it
did
disappoint
i
guess
i
just
had
too
high
of
expectations
summary
a
backyard
grilling
or
lawnmower
beer
not
really
any
redeeming
or
memorable
qualities
i
shall
be
looking
else
where
for
an
better
bitter
md
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
it
had
a
light
bitter
aftertaste
to
it
this
is
not
really
a
memorable
beer
and
would
order
again
only
if
there
was
nothing
else
on
tap
that
i
had
not
tried
or
liked
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
greene
king
for
many
reasons
but
credit
where
credit
is
due
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
i
have
often
drunk
although
normally
in
cask
form
weak
even
as
a
bitter
as
is
correctly
classified
here
as
it
is
no
ipa
but
drinkable
easy
but
pretty
nondescript
and
forgettable
poured
chestnut
mahoganey
hue
perfectly
clear
one
finger
offwhite
head
quickly
settled
and
left
a
thin
disappearing
surface
coating
with
a
fading
ring
no
lacing
and
lazy
carbonation
smell
was
grassy
musky
hint
of
malt
but
mostly
absent
very
little
by
way
of
hops
some
malt
bitterness
front
and
centre
but
with
an
astringent
metallic
cloying
thud
lingering
in
a
nonfavourable
way
overall
impression
not
very
good
the
label
says
to
be
drunk
with
spicy
foods
like
curries
and
thats
not
a
bad
idea
as
it
might
overshadow
some
deficiencies
in
the
brew
least
favourite
of
the
three
ive
had
from
this
brewery
so
far
gold
color
thin
head
with
some
lacing
in
a
pint
glass
dull
lager
type
aroma
grains
and
mildly
grassy
taste
brought
more
of
the
same
dry
and
grassy
hop
character
with
a
body
that
felt
more
lager
than
ipa
dry
finish
and
a
pretty
subdued
taste
thin
on
carbonation
but
slightly
above
watery
in
body
easy
to
drink
but
ultimately
nondescript
and
forgettable
overall
representative
of
the
intent
of
an
english
bitter

this
is
indeed
just
an

ale
as
ba
categorizes
it
otherwise
the
score
would
be
tremendously
lower
the
printed
description
on
the
can
still
purports
this
beer
as
following
in
the
tradition
of
the
original
ipas
so
i
still
have
to
mark
it
down
somewhat
for
claiming
something
that
it

shouldnt

theres

it
is

a

better
than

expected
not

only
a
hint
of
lacing
nice
malty
flavors
balanced
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
nice
surprise
tastes
very
like
an
adjunct

except
no
dimethylsulfide
some
diacetyl
would
have
helped
this
is
supposed
to
compete
for
the

of
the

crowd
it
should
since
it
is
pretty

with

very
drinkable

most
english
bitters
compromise
flavour
specifically
hoppiness
to
ensure
approachability
and
drinkability
but
this
ale
shows
us
no
sacrifice
need
be
made
i
honestly
didnt
expect
to
fall
in
love
with
old
golden
hen
as
i
have
perhaps
i
shouldnt
be
so
surprised
given
how
impressed
i
am
with
old
crafty
hen
and
how
much
i
enjoy
the
flagship
old
speckled
hen
a
great
brewery
o
im
not
sure
what
to
think
about
this
beer
i
have
to
wonder
if
it
wouldnt
be
better
if
it
were
straight
from
the
keg
i
imagine
this
might
be
a
good
session
beer
but
it
needs
to
be
fresh
definitely
hurt
by
the

an
a
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
bitters
but
old
golden
hen
is
easily
my
favourite
so
far
the
hops
are
fresh
and
interesting
the
malt
backbone
is
light
but
sturdy
overall
this
is
just
a
great
englishstyle
session
ale
ive
always
had
a
fondness
for
bitters
and
even
though
i
havent
had
a
new
one
in
a
while
this
brew
immediately
reminded
me
why
i
love
them
so
much
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
not
get
sick
of
it
much
better
than
old
speckled
hen
which
is
a
decent
session
ale
in
its
own
right
overall
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
solid
very
drinkable
and
pretty
refreshing
probably
not
something
id
pick
up
again
but
a
beer
worth
trying
overall
a
light
but
tasty
brew
with
a
low
abv
the
perfect
recipe
for
warm
weather
overall
i
didnt
like
this
beer
at
all
at
least
not
out
of
the
bottle
too
damn
skunky
note
this
was
part
of
the
hen
house
4
pack
that
morland
sells
and
the
other
beers
in
that
4
pack
old
speckled
hen
hens
tooth
and
old
crafty
hen
which
are
also
sold
in
clear
bottles
tasted
fine
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
of
this
beer
i
really
need
to
seek
it
out
on
tap
as
the
other
reviews
are
completely
different
from
my
experience
maybe
my
bottle
was
contaminatedbad
notes
why
do
brewers
use
clear
bottles
overall
drinkability
a
good
english
bitter
i
wonder
what
this
would
be
like
on
cask
probably
less
carbonated
nice
color
interesting
aroma
and
taste
pretty
drinkable
as
well
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
o
a
very
promising
english
bitter
i
enjoy
the
great
hop
aromas
and
flavors
in
this
beer
as
well
as
its
easy
drinkability
definitely
one
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
classic
english
ales
a
light
body
wants
to
go
medium
and
its
got
a
good
level
of
carbonation
keeping
it
lively
though
it
doesnt
really
translate
to
crispness
theres
a
hint
of
it
but
it
mostly
goes
fairly
smooth
rather
like
a
wellbalanced
darkish
ipa
floralherbal
rather
than
fruit
enhanced
since
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
fruit
flavors
in
beer
this
one
stands
out
to
me
id
probably
take
it
over
lagunitas
ipa
perhaps
that
just
shows
what
an
anglophile
i
am
overall
this
was
the
fourth
beer
from
a
morland
hen
house
fourpack
though
it
is
fairly
good
it
is
my
least
favorite
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
as
the
label
says
and
one
that
i
might
have
again
thought
i
would
take
a
shot
on
this
since
it
was
on
special
for
3pint
and
im
always
up
for
british
session
ales
clear
gold
aptly
named
with
a
thin
white
head
that
nearly
disappears
oddly
fruity
the
mix
of
english
yeast
with
galaxy
hops
is
certainly
unique
lime
stands
out
along
with
some
peach
and
a
grassy
herbal
note
malt
is
minimal
with
a
light
graininess
and
a
hint
of
corn
just
a
hint
of
butter
at
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
something
low
abv
it
was
interesting
to
taste
galaxy
hops
in
something
besides
a
big
aggressive
american
ale
o
very
solid
nice
crispness
moderately
complex
flavors
a
nice
session
beer
with
the
low
abv
pours
a
clear
golden
copper
body
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
collar
aromas
are
very
biscuity
with
brighter
notes
of
a
citrus
stand
taste
is
lightly
earthy
and
wet
leafy
and
finishes
light
breakfast
tea
dressed
with
a
spot
of
lemon
medium
light
body
and
easy
drinkability
make
it
a
nice
session
ale
whose
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
bet
it
still
tastes
fine
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
copperbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
lemon
peel
fluffy
biscuit
light
honey
light
greens
and
a
hint
of
skunk
damn
glass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
deeper
vein
of
greens
this
time
closer
to
tobacco
than
anything
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
an
alright
little
bitter
but
nothing
all
that
special
minus
the
skunk
character
this
is
a
great
bitter
damn
clear
bottles
good
herbal
hop
character
lightly
toasted
caramel
malt
and
nice
bitter
finish
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
sugar
and
a
slight
skunky
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
but
its
drinkable
for
what
it
is
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
small
snifter
fluffy
white
head
medium
retention
atop
a
very
clear
golden
body
go
figure
its
perfectly
golden
aroma
is
lightly
hoppy
with
breadybiscuity
malt
aroma
mild
sweetness
very
pleasant
and
inviting
taste
is
light
caramel
and
light
bitterness
not
a
lot
going
on
but
nothing
bad
going
on
very
easy
to
drink
im
sure
quite
sessionable
to
the
average
english
drinker
o
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
just
not
a
lot
too
it
doesnt
smell
or
taste
bad
but
doesnt
smell
or
taste
good
either
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
o
easy
to
drink
with
the
light
body
and
low
abv
but
yet
still
quite
flavorful
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
that
reminds
me
of
sitting
in
the
pub
in
the
uk
after
work
overall
a
wonderful
flavorful
session
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
if
i
could
pick
this
up
locally
and
it
was
cheaper
it
would
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
us
breweries
really
need
to
take
a
closer
look
at
this
style
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
beautiful
two
finger
white
and
soapy
head
the
nose
is
light
as
expected
there
is
light
slightly
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
honey
the
galaxy
hops
that
the
back
of
the
bottle
references
are
only
slightly
recognizable
in
the
flavor
but
absent
in
the
nose
its
mild
as
it
should
be
it
is
refreshing
though
its
very
light
in
body
and
very
drinkable
if
this
were
in
six
packs
it
would
sell
very
well
good
esb
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
given
its
light
body
but
still
manages
to
pack
in
a
good
amount
of
aroma
and
flavors
overalljust
a
well
done
session
strength
bitter
here
hope
to
see
this
around
more
since
stuff
this
good
at
such
a
low
abv
is
pretty
rare
here
in
the
us
decidedly
average
another
bland
golden
ale
from
a
big
brewery
the
diacetyl
is
particularly
unwelcome
it
spoils
the
drinking
experience
there
are
faint
hints
of
aromatic
hops
but
i
cant
say
that
the
galaxy
really
shines
through
in
summary
its
dull
give
it
a
miss
pint
served
in
a
footed
adnams
shaker
small
head
very
clear
amber
colour
very
much
like
apple
juice
hoppy
citrus
smell
tasted
of
citrus
fruits
with
a
nice
balanced
bitter
finish
theres
more
than
enough
to
keep
me
interested
even
at
a
low
adv
smooth
mouthfull
overall
id
say
a
very
good
session
beer
im
as
quick
as
anyone
to
slag
off
greene
king
but
credit
where
its
due
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
md
the
flavour
of
hops
treads
lightly
on
a
medium
body
while
the
lively
carbonation
at
times
strikes
as
a
bit
too
much
to
my
liking
an
effect
retreating
as
the
drink
goes
overall
this
is
an
unexciting
but
decentlymade
golden
ale
easy
enough
to
drink
with
a
moderate
level
of
hop
bitterness
taste
to
offer
original
taste
and
incredible
refreshing
summer
ale
while
still
being
tasty
and
bitter
if
you
like
lemony
and
dryness
try
this
brew
suggestion
drink
it
fresh
or
dont
drink
it
all
overall
impression
not
a
bad
ale
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
to
refresh
your
system
but
not
an
ale
or
style
for
that
matter
that
provides
much
complexity
or
depth
balanced
not
bad
but
not
earth
shattering
overall
very
refreshing
easy
to
drink
but
not
so
hoppy
as
you
expect
for
an
english
bitter
ale
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
english
bitter
disappointing
i
had
expectations
of
this
being
a
pleasant
pale
ale
with
a
hoppy
character
not
so
i
looks
nice
and
has
decent
body
but
the
aroma
is
horrid
and
the
flavour
also
leaves
much
to
desire
not
sure
whats
wrong
with
the
smell
but
it
is
dominated
completely
by
a
harsh
sulphurlike
quality
this
carries
through
into
the
flavour
masking
this
ales
subtle
malt
and
hop
characteristics
all
said
not
a
good
drinking
experience
its
a
pity
because
ive
had
this
before
ages
ago
and
liked
it
so
i
dont
know
what
the
issue
is
here
perhaps
i
should
seek
it
out
on
cask
at
any
rate
id
have
to
recommend
avoiding
this
in
bottles
if
you
like
beer
o
nice
for
a
change
would
definitely
try
this
again
particularly
from
a
different
serving
format
just
to
see
what
differences
there
might
be
m
while
the
ale
is
light
it
doesnt
skimp
on
flavor
the
rising
bitterness
is
a
reminder
that
the
brits
know
their
way
around
hops
too
o
nope
a
very
average
beer
in
my
opinion
i
tried
on
a
recommendation
while
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
highly
touted
ale
it
just
didnt
blow
me
away
pale
straw
color
slightly
foggy
white
lasting
froth
small

close
dense
thick

rocky

bread

subtle

subtle

medium

high

quite
bland
overall
a
whole
lot
better
than
the
bottled
version
are
they
the
same
beer
poured
a
capped
500ml
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
a
highly
fizzy
hazy
straw
with
a
massive
5
inch
cap
or
should
i
say
the
whole
glass
of
creamy
white
head
splotchy
soapy
lacing
was
left
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
rather
generic
a
bit
of
biscuit
some
caramel
and
a
nice
yeasty
twang
the
flavor
is
simple
straightforward
and
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
a
bit
of
biscuit
a
bit
of
caramel
tart
yeast
and
just
a
little
grassy
hops
this
is
where
my
biggest
issue
with
this
beer
is
its
way
to
carbonated
the
carbonation
level
almost
makes
it
astringent
its
like
soaking
your
tongue
in
sprite
overall
this
beer
falls
flat
into
the
average
range
not
the
best
bitter
ive
had
but
definitely
not
the
worst
didnt
see
that
coming
this
is
no
longer
the
best
beer
in
its
class
but
it
is
a
beer
that
was
almost
revolutionary
in
its
early
years
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
converts
the
lager
heathens
in
to
real
ale
fanatics
5
pints
of
this
on
a
friday
after
a
tough
week
is
a
super
way
to
start
the
weekend
taste
was
more
hoppier
than
i
would
have
expected
soft
herbal
and
floral
notes

tasted
like
a
summer

yes

i
could

a
somewhat
schizophrenic
beer
here
pours
a
crisp
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
that
laced
nicely
some
floating
sediment
was
evident
even
though
i
didnt
pour
hard
nor
poured
the
whole
bottle
the
aroma
was
some
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
malt
though
dominated
by
vegetal
aromas
upon
further
consideration
though
those
aromas
could
be
earthiness
the
body
tasted
nothing
of
the
vegetal
though
with
low
bitterness
which
played
well
against
the
light
malt
body
average
mouthfeel
but
a
quite
drinkable
brewski
for
a
summer
day
good
stuff
slainte
pale
clear
golden
orange
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
spicy
earthy
hops
in
the

lemon
and
something
slightly
sour
the
taste
is
well
balanced
not
really
exciting
or
boring
it
has
an
earthy
mineral
character
and
has
english
hops
and
malt
written
all
over
it
this
would
be
a
fine
beer
to
chug
in
the
summer
though
not
without
flaws
and
i
imagine
it
could
be
hard
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
color
15
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
yeast
pale
malt
pale
hops
and
slight
metallic
fits
the
style
of
an
english
bitter
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
hops
pale
malt
slight
citrus
yeast
and
slight
metallic
overall
a
little
lacking
in
body
too
much
metallic
but
interesting
mouthfeel
was
about
where
i
would
expect
it
given
the
abv
might
be
a
summer
refresher
if
served
cold
but
then
again
there
are
several
that
fill
that
bill
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
nice
cask
bitter
a
very
refreshing
summer
ale
as
hoppy
on
cask
as
i
always
wished
it
was
in
the
bottle
ho
hum
neither
really
bad
or
really
good
that
middle
ground
of
easy
to
drink
yet
easy
to
forget
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
prickly
carbonation
drinkability
is
average
d
not
bad
but
nothing
spectacular
pretty
drinkable
yes
nice
session
brew
d
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
several
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
a
little
overcarbonated
for
my
liking
especially
for
an
english
bitter
thin
bodied
this
went
very
well
with
the
meal
which
had
more
than
enough
flavours
no
lightning
while
drinking
but
we
have
had
more
than
enough
thunderstorms
today
and
this
season
hopefully
this
pleases
the
lightning
gods
yellowgold

would
be

i
not
been

not

simillarly
mild
hops
are
light

pleasant
refreshing
earthy
finish
with
a
bit
of
malt
thrown
in
bitterness
is

this
is
an
easy
going
summer
ale
that
could
easily
be
a
sessional
but
remains
pretty
uncomplicated
thanks
to
jan
for
picking
this
up
for
me
to
check
out
d
easy
to
drink
a
good
ale
overall
i
like
this
one
to
have
more
than
one
per
night
would
surely
buy
more
if
it
was
available
in
the
province
of
quebec
summer
lightning
didnt
create
any
sparks
to
be
fair
it
is
by
the
brewerys
own
admission
a
better
beer
in
its
true
element
as
a
real
that
is
to
say
alive
unfiltered
and
caskconditioned
ale
its
sort
of
like
having
a
glass
of
icecold
lemonade
in
the
heart
of
winter
you
can
taste
it
but
you
arent
really
tasting
it
if
you
catch
my
drift
hopefully
one
day
ill
make
it
to
wiltshire
and
get
a
proper
sample
youll
have
to
try
it
and
tell
me
what
you
think
i
dont
like
it
i
would
never
drink
it
again
if
i
could
undrink
it
i
would
clear
but
slightly
hazed
golden
yellow
looks
a
lot
like
a
lighter
honey
crowned
with
a
lacy
white
head
with
fair
retention
pilsnerish
delicately
leafyfloral
lettucedandelion
hops
and
a
pleasant
orangeandhoney
sort
of
biscuity
malt
sweetness
tickle
the
olfactory
glands
crisply
hopped
with
a
nice
firm
citric
bitterness
that
dominates
the
overall
flavor
but
not
without
letting
a
mild
but
noticeably
nutty
wholegrainy
malt
character
to
shine
through
quite
nicely
robust
and
refreshing
yet
light
with
a
pithy
hop
finish
that
dries
up
nicely
but
leaves
enough
juicy
sweetness
to
pull
you
back
in
for
more
this
is
a
lovely
summer
ale
that
drinks
like
a
really
very
good
pilsner
or
kölsch
possibly
a
good
curry
beer
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
this
is
the
definition
of
thirst
quencher
good
flavours
while
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
delight
to
do
so
im
enjoying
it
from
the

2009
the
look
was
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
very
puffy
fizzy
white
head
it
looked
more
like
an
american
pale
than
an
english
bitter
not
dark
enough
in
my
opinion
the
aroma
is
hoppy
mildly
yeasty
and
vaguely
fruity
again
not
what
i
am
used
to
in
an
english
bitter
the
mouthfeel
has
reasonable
carbonation
and
texture
the
flavor
was
very
sour
and
tart
rather
than
hoppy
this
seemed
to
have
more
of
the
properties
of
a
blonde
it
was
a
pretty
good
blonde
but
an
average
bitter
what
a
shame
that
this
was
my
500th
review
blech
i
cannot
form
the
words
to
say
how
exceedingly
disappointed
i
am
with
this
an
english
bitter
um
no
it
isnt
it
poured
up
like
a
hefeweizen
a
light
moderately
cloudy
fizzy
thing
smell
was
almost
like
a
sour
bmc
sort
of
thing
taste
was
like
a
mildly
hoppy
pilsner
an
absolute
disaster
imo
i
really
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
too
pity
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
generous
white
head
nose
is
plain
with
wheat
cracker
grain
and
slight
fruit
palate
is
ordinary
as
well
with
light
malt
slight
citrus
good
carbonation
and
nothing
exciting
at
all
finish
doesnt
offer
much
either
pass
on
this
beer
a
really
interesting
drop
chockfull
of
character
and
with
a
huge
deal
to
like
really
pleased
i
bought
this
d
this
is
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
not
my
favorite
but
good
nonetheless
drinkability
with
the
light
lemon
flavor
this
is
more
like
a
summer
ale
than
a
bitter
500ml
brown
bottle
from
the
lighthouse
in
manchester
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
body
with
a
good
halfinch
of
persistent
offwhite
head
smells
like
caramel
malt
with
spicy
grassy
and
citrussy
hops
tastes
like
bready
malt
with
some
caramel
character
and
just
enough
grassy
spicy
citrussy
hops
to
provide
balance
light
bodied
with
light
natural
carbonation
flavors
while
subtle
are
balanced
and
pleasing
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
sure
a
lighter
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
md
crisp
for
a
golden
bitter
it
drinks
absolutely
refreshing
yet
also
smooth
thanks
to
the
attenuated
carbonation
level
although
its
not
as
flavoursome
and
assertively
hoppy
as
the
cask
version
when
served
absolutely
fresh
this
raib
version
is
still
a
fullflavoured
but
lightbodied
and
quaffable
hoppy
golden
bitter
pours
a
nice
hazy
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
littlye
creamy
white
head
which
leaves
alot
of
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
hoppy
bitter
and
slightly
sour
the
taste
is
hoppy
bitter
with
some
sourness
medium
body
with
some
nice
bitterness
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
english
bitter
d
this
is
a
nice
bitter
nothing
fabulous
but
certainly
drinkable
extrememly
drinkable
has
a
casklike
character
to
it
i
can
imagine
this
being
awesome
to
say
the
least
poured
fresh
from
a
cask
i
could
happily
drink
this
all
day
esp
in
the
summer
but
any
time
of
year
it
has
subtle
complexities
with
both
a
nice
malty
and
hoppy
character
wellbalanced
and
very
smooth
a
unique
brew
for
the
style
that
works
very
well
worth
a
shot
a
good
beer
i
recommend
it
for
those
that
havent
tried
it
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
a
fresh
crisp
beer
from
a
brewery
notorious
for
its
real
ale
mouthfeel
was
zippy
despite
the
lack
of
active
carbonation
bubbles
and
the
low
alcohol
content
medium
bodied
very
nice
overall
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
all
that
exciting
either
at
8aus
a
bottle
i
could
think
of
many
better
options
taste
reminds
me
a
little
of
czech
pilsner
lightly
malty
with
a
grassy
hop
in
the
middle
honey
lingers
faintly
in
the
aftertaste
biscuit
or
crackery
presence
very
clean
feel
smooth
with
low
carbonation
hop
bite
is
mild
but
adds
a
pleasant
bittering
at
the
end
it
would
be
much
easier
to
session
this
on
a
cask
the
5
cost
of
the
bottle
is
a
little
prohibitive
on
the
session
end
of
things
d
with
enough
flavor
presence
to
keep
the
tongue
intrigued
this
one
is
worth
a
try
i
enjoyed
the
subtleties
and
more
assertive
hop
character
that
didnt
kill
the
palate
i
got
a
sense
of
freshness
as
well
from
this
beer
and
recommend
it
to
those
who
think
theyve
got
what
an
english
bitter
means
down
to
a
science
it
may
surprise
you
a
refreshing
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
really
memorable
beer
either
i
had
this
in
the
turf
tavern
oxford
uk
if
anyone
is
in
the
region
i
highly
recommend
this
pub
for
its
large
choice
and
excellent
handling
of
quality
ale
the
body
was
fairly
watery
and
i
burped
for
about
a
halfhour
after
finishing
the
beer
a
decent
summer
lawnmower
beer
but
a
bit
overly
priced
for
what
it
is
drinkability
certainly
refreshing
in
the
summertime
if
i
was
outside
in
the
sun
i
might
enjoy
it
more
and
want
another
otherwise
its
just
a
fairly
plain
lightish
beer
a
fine
golden
ale
indeed
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
many
english
brews
but
this
was
delightfully
competant
a
nice
change
of
pace
summer
beer
good
choice
for
a
summer
afternoon
session
ale
poured
a
light
golden
straw
moderate
head
malt
was
not
prominent
in
the
flavor
profile
and
the
body
was
light
and
lagerish
but
not
watery
moderate
hopping
cleaned
up
at
the
finish
overall
a
very
tasty
ale
perfectly
suited
for
hot
weather
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
ale
an
excellent
summer
drinker

2007
im
a
bit
confussed
about
the
lower
ratings
for
this
brew
folks
this
is
a
really
good
brew
maybe
the
comparisons
to
a
pale
ale
hurts
a
bit
but
its
supposed
to
be
a
bitter
the
brew
starts
off
with
an
obvious
bottleconditioned
hazed
and
light
carbonation
trying
to
capture
the
essence
of
caskconditioning
the
brew
could
handle
a
bit
deeper
more
of
a
golden
hue
but
the
beer
looks
nice
and
frothy
fresh
aromas
of
pine
and
freshcut
grass
complement
the
medium
pilsner
malts
nicely
offering
a
balance
and
added
character
above
the
sweetness
fruity
pears
and
appricots
spicy
fuggle
hops
and
super
clean
flavors
meld
neatly
the
feel
is
a
soft
candied
texture
and
a
firm
hop
bite
finishes
very
clean
with
a
dryhop
linger
really
liking
this
brew
nice
beer
you
could
enjoy
these
easily
as
session
beer
my
biggest
revelation
of
2007
is
learning
to
appreciate
the
less
is
more
in
beer
styles
like
this
so
once
again
i
find
myself
enjoying
the
soothing
calming
relaxing
pace
of
a
beer
like
this
over
the
actual
taste
i
cannot
quite
place
my
finger
on
it
but
maybe
im
starting
to
get
this
this
was
good
a
nice
easy
to
drink
english
bitter
that
would
excel
in
warmer
weather
per
its
name
could
pair
very
well
with
any
grilled
fare
some
light
soft
cheese
shellfish
or
just
a
good
hot
sandwich
there
are
much
tastier
beers
to
be
had
but
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
a
summers
night
lingering
over
good
simple
food
with
a
few
good
friends
give
it
a
shot
drinkability
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
hoppy
freshly
brewed
blonde
ale
really
refreshing
a
decent
bottled
beer
that
evokes
images
of
drinking
in
a
english
country
pub
beer
garden
on
a
long
summer
evening
now
what
would
be
really
interesting
would
be
to
try
this
as
a
cask
ale
pours
a
very
light
gold
color
perfectly
clear
with
a
sticky
head
that
leaves
lacing
and
a
collar
im
surprised
at
how
clear
this
is
given
the
bottle
conditioning
fine
english
hop
aroma
combined
with
some
sweet
malts
monkey
fruit
and
apples
on
the
palate
theres
a
nice
snappy
bitterness
here
that
resonates
like
a
rubber
band
stretched
to
the
nearbreaking
point
toward
the
finish
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
comes
out
and
adds
a
juicy
burst
to
things
but
this
beer
never
veers
over
into
sweet
territory
its
always
very
dry
which
would
make
this
a
great
summer
beer
the
finish
is
prickly
and
quite
dry
its
bitter
in
the
english
way
not
the
american
way
snappy
not
sludgy
very
lean
mouthfeel
almost
ephemeral
and
very
drinkable
this
is
quite
a
nice
bitter
overall
i
would
absolutely
order
this
for
session
drinking
summer
drinking
or
bar
food
pairing
especially
fried
stuff
like
fish
and
chips
very
good
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
too
exciting
but
very
drinkable
certainly
worth
a
try
notes
im
really
getting
into
english
bitters
and
this
one
to
me
is
a
nice
representation
more
hopped
up
and
on
the
dry
end
of
the
house
for
the
style
which
fits
my
taste
buds
perfectly
pick
this
up
if
you
have
the
chance
rather
bland
for
a
brewery
with
hop
in
its
name
in
oregon
that
means
boom
hops
and
not
as
rich
as
i
would
expect
a
golden
ale
to
be
perhaps
it
would
be
called
a
summer
ale
in
the
us
poured
from
the
large
bottle
to
a
strawberry
blonde
with
white
foamy
head
very
good
lacing
and
thousands
of
carbonation
bubbles
hard
to
detect
any
particular
aroma
other
than
the
hops
but
just
a
very
fine
tasting
beer
with
a
long
smooth
slightly
dry
finish
pours
out
of
the
half
liter
bottle
a
cloudy
golden
hue
with
a
frothy
head
which
leaves
lots
of
lace
a
grassy
herbal
and
lightly
malty
aroma
very
nice
taste
is
along
the
lines
of
your
typical
golden
ales
or
kolsch
style
beers
lightly
fruity
sweet
with
lots
of
earthy
grassy
and
slightly
minty
hop
notes
as
its
bottle
conditioned
i
mixed
in
the
sediment
contrary
to
the
directions
on
the
bottle
i
guess
i
just
prefer
it
that
way
anyway
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
lively
adding
to
the
appropriate
body
just
a
nice
summer
time
ale
drinkability
rates
high
just
because
its
so
quenching
and
tasty
and
it
is
summer
and
im
damn
thirsty
too
bad
i
have
only
one
bottle
it
went
down
quick
and
was
very
satisfying
highly
recommended
as
a
summer
quencher
crux
damn
fine
bottle
conditioned
golden
ale
needs
more
hops
imho
but
this
hits
the
spot
anyway
well
worth
the
sample
d
well
it
was
a
nice
beer
but
a
bit
boring
for
my
tastes
well
designed
and
flawless
for
what
is
is
a
bottle
conditioned
english
ale
unfortunately
not
my
favorite
styles
but
im
being
open
minded
with
this
review
d
dont
believe
the
hype
on
the
bottle
i
feel
like
this
is
a
english
bitter
that
is
dumbed
down
with
a
nice
label
for
the
american
market
it
would
be
nice
to
taste
some
more
of
the
malt
and
turn
down
the
carbonation
a
bottle
conditioned
summer
brew
interesting
this
one
is
tasty
and
i
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
in
ny
one
day
damn
i
would
like
to
have
this
around
in
the
summer
a
nice
easy
drinking
but
definitely
complex
brew
i
rather
enjoyed
what
the
sediment
did
when
added
in
on
the
second
glass
although
it
is
more
drinkable
without
it
the
extra
dimension
makes
it
more
interesting
light
and
sweet
corn
malt
a
bit
of
astringent
hop
flavor
light
in
the
mouth
and
finishes
clean
very
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
sitting
in
the
shade
wish
i
had
this
last
night
for
the
thunderstorm
but
i
think
it
pairs
better
with
a
sunny
day
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
carbonation
was
more
than
i
expected
for
the
style
but
that
did
not
bother
me
the
crisp
finish
made
it
refreshing
the
beer
its
self
had
slightly
more
body
than
a
macronot
watery
at
all
but
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
awards
boasted
on
the
bottle
had
me
expecting
a
little
bit
more
might
be
a
good
transition
beer
for
macro
drinkers
and
i
guess
its
good
for
a
hot
day
overall
a
reasonably
good
refreshing
ale
for
a
summers
evening
i
think
this
served
cool
outside
on
a
warm
summers
evening
would
be
ideal
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
session
bitter
i
would
gladly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
something
light
and
tasty
to
enjoy
this
one
pours
out
a
nice
and
very
clear
golden
straw
color
just
as
the
bottle
said
mine
poured
a
nice
white
head
about
12
inch
rhar
dissipated
quickyl
there
was
some
malt
smell
but
did
not
pick
up
any
hops
very
nice
i
am
not
getting
too
much
in
the
scent
just
some
maltiness
there
is
a
nice
amt
of
carbonation
rising
up
through
the
glass
it
has
a
nice
malt
and
hop
flavor
thats
well
balanced
but
still
manages
to
leave
a
bitter
tingle
after
every
sip
this
one
was
nice
to
drink
on
the
back
deck
by
the
pool
very
refreshing
and
none
too
heavy
finished
dry
and
very
well
balanced
medium
bodied
brew
very
drinkable
and
at
5
gives
just
a
tinge
of
warmth
on
you
after
the
second
or
so
basically
a
very
nice
refreshing
brew
served
from
a
16
9
oz
bottle
without
freshness
date
an
unusually
light
and
very
clear
golden
color
with
huge
foamy
white
head
and
great
head
retention
smells
quite
fresh
and
fruity
lots
of
hop
floweriness
here
a
little
lacking
in
initial
taste
but
quickly
builds
strong
flowery
and
herbal
flavors
before
finishing
very
long
and
extremely
dry
very
light
overly
so
and
carbonated
in
the
mouth
an
unusual
and
extremely
drinkable
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
body
topped
by
an
enormous
rocky
snowwhite
head
that
pits
and
craters
strong
retention
and
blobs
of
patch
lace
are
left
all
over
the
imperial
pint
glass
aroma
is
muted
with
herbal
and
grassy
hops
atop
some
sweetish
pale
malt
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
bodied
with
spritzy
high
carbonation
bitter
grassy
hops
drive
the
flavor
from
start
to
finish
with
slightly
sweet
biscuity
malt
providing
a
solid
backbone
a
hint
of
pear
emerges
as
it
warms
nicely
executed
english
bitter
well
balanced
and
very
sessionable
ok
ive
decided
i
like
this
beer
im
just
not
sure
how
much
its
so
pilsnerlike
all
around
so
refreshing
hmmm
you
should
try
some
its
worth
the
effort
gotta
love
the
cask
this
beer
appeared
a
very
light
amber
color
with
a
pretty
substantial
head
clinging
to
the
glass
smell
isnt
really
that
expressive
but
a
nice
herbal
hop
quality
hits
the
nose
as
for
the
taste
its
pretty
hoppy
there
as
well
with
a
great
bitter
kick
i
might
be
apt
to
look
for
a
little
more
flavor
however
its
a
tad
bland
however
almost
anything
tastes
good
on
cask
nice
super
smooth
mouthfeel
excellent
like
i
said
a
little
more
complexity
of
character
would
make
this
beer
stand
out
more
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
with
a
slight
hop
presence
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
crisp
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
mild
bitter
hop
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
although
i
feel
its
highly
overrated
it
doesnt
have
nearly
the
aroma
and
taste
it
boasts
of
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
smells
of
lemon
yeast
bananas
and
coriander
tastes
very
wheaty
and
yeasty
yet
light
drinkable
all
day
long
a
great
session
beer
for
mr
moneybags
for
me
a
great
sampling
highly
recommended
by
the
barwench
and
with
her
i
must
agree
after
all
the
hype
on
the
bottle
i
was
let
down
by
the
performance
kind
of
like
buying
a
ferrari
with
a
lawn
mower
engine
comming
off
a
local
stout
and
porter
i
just
did
not
find
much
in
bitterness
a
lesson
on
not
adding
something
this
light
at
the
end
of
a
tasting
a
ba
buddy
was
equally
uninpressed
and
preceeded
it
with
a
ipa
i
may
revisit
it
this
summer
and
start
out
with
it
hazy
yellow
body
with
a
small
head
for
the
duration
of
the
pint
alcohol
whiffs
and
a
light
fruity
fragrance
taste
is
bitter
citrus
and
a
bit
cloying
to
my
dismay
a
little
strong
in
terms
of
alcohol
taste
and
sharp
citric
flavors
for
an
english
esb
i
guess
thats
why
they
call
it
lightning
shortlived
uneven
offwhite
head
over
the
golden
brew
aroma
is
pale
malts
with
a
tinge
of
vinegar
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
with
some
hoppy
crispness
at
the
close
mouthfeel
is
okay
with
the
vinegar
presence
knocking
it
a
bit
and
the
drinkability
is
good
worth
a
try
as
all
cask
ales
usually
are
hopefully
i
just
had
a
bit
of
a
bad
experience
with
this
one
and
the
norm
is
better
had
this
brew
last
evening
at
mahars
and
was
server
on
cask
this
brew
was
pulled
to
a
cloudy
pale
yellowgolden
but
not
like
an
american
macro
color
with
a
nice
frothy
whipped
like
head
that
had
fantastic
retention
and
produced
excellent
lacing
the
aromas
of
this
brew
where
of
a
hoppy
nature
had
a
pine
and
grapefruit
hop
aroma
that
was
very
noticeable
and
then
had
a
solid
malt
smell
that
was
biscuity
and
buttery
a
very
interesting
smelling
brew
the
taste
was
nice
very
well
balanced
between
the
hop
like
tastes
and
malt
the
hop
notes
tasted
more
floral
than
citrus
like
imo
and
the
malt
backbone
of
this
brew
is
real
nice
and
as
i
said
really
balances
out
the
brew
this
is
a
brew
that
i
could
sit
around
and
enjoy
for
an
evening
as
it
is
quite
refreshing
but
next
time
i
hope
to
experience
it
during
the
actual
summer
or
warmer
months
seems
a
bit
weird
having
something
called
summer
lightning
in
january
when
the
temp
was
1
out
on
cask
at
the
head
of
steam
euston
station
dark
goldenamber
big
white
head
for
a
cask
ale
a
pretty
looking
beer
for
sure
but
how
does
it
smell
the
aromas
are
very
nice
east
kent
golding
hops
meld
with
buttery
biscuity
malts
reminiscent
of
fresh
baked
bread
the
taste
is
that
of
a
well
balanced
strong
english
bitter
a
nice
floral
hoppiness
dances
with
a
lightly
toasty
maltiness
to
create
a
very
very
drinkable
ale
this
ale
is
medium
bodiedlight
with
low
carbonation
and
an
insane
drinkability
wow
now
that
i
have
done
this
review
i
have
just
remembered
how
good
this
beer
is
on
the
hand
pump
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
bottle
to
review
soon
poured
out
a
nice
and
very
clear
golden
piles
of
creamy
white
head
layered
up
then
finally
reduced
down
and
stayed
as
a
thick
layer
very
nice
i
am
not
getting
too
much
in
the
scent
just
some
maltiness
good
amount
of
carbination
rising
up
through
the
glass
good
amount
of
carbination
just
right
malty
and
hoppy
leaves
a
tingle
in
your
mouth
after
each
sip
fairly
balanced
flavors
though
leaves
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
in
your
mouth
nice
summer
day
brew
very
easy
drinker
there
are
three
fingers
of
bubbly
foam
its
almost
white
and
leaves
crazy
sticky
lacing
the
beer
is
a
clear
darkish
gold
the
aroma
is
faint
a
little
dusty
and
inky
with
crackers
apples
and
anonymous
fruit
appear
in
the
sweet
front
the
sweet
malty
middle
feels
foamy
in
the
end
nutty
fruiy
hoppy
nicely
bitter
and
nutty
alcohol
aftertaste
its
a
decent
sweet
fruity
nutty
blonde
ale
light
and
crisp
a
nice
beer
nothing
outstanding
either
way
other
comments
the
publican
told
me
this
was
a
strong
beer
to
which
i
replied
i
lived
in
belgium
for
a
year
this
is
not
strong
she
was
not
amused
good
beer
though
plenty
of
hops
without
overpowering
the
senses
touch
of
mold
in
the
background
though
this
could
have
more
to
do
with
the
serving
conditions
my
compliments
to
the
brewer
recomended
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
decent
head
and
a
mad
amount
of
lace
even
for
a
cask
ale
it
totally
coats
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
lemony
hops
and
wheat
malt
the
taste
is
equal
parts
citrusy
very
floral
hops
and
light
bready
malts
the
hops
make
a
very
nice
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
perfection
very
silky
and
subtley
carbonated
the
aftertaste
is
crisp
and
lightly
bitter
an
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
casks
i
tried
in
england
really
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
in
this
cask
version
nice
smooth
and
refreshing
malt
body
a
slight
fruit
touch
a
little
floral
some
nice
soft
subtle
bitterness
beyond
that
though
just
a
basic
thirst
quencher
for
me
i
might
have
to
see
if
i
can
find
a
bottle
of
this
somewhere
else
pours
a
hazed
yellow
gold
color
with
a
thick
rocky
offwhite
colored
head
subtly
fruity
malty
bready
and
hoppy
in
the
aroma
herbal
and
botanical
notes
too
lighter
body
keeps
this
beer
drinkable
dulled
husklike
notes
in
the
malt
and
a
citric
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
finishes
slightly
astringent
but
just
about
enough
to
balance
the
maltiness
pretty
nice
session
brew
with
a
good
balance
it
seems
a
little
unconventional
for
an
english
bitter
because
of
its
sunny
look
but
it
feels
like
a
bitter
hyperdrinkable
ale
and
lighter
in
character
than
any
from
england
that
i
can
remember
akin
to
coopers
sparkling
only
no
yeast
matter
and
more
toasty
dry
less
exotic
an
easy
drink
thin
mouthfeel
golden
somewhat
hopped
but
understated
bit
of
wheat
and
wheatgerm
low
carbonation
floral
hops
cloves
sweet
csugar
cookie
malt
and
bannana
fresh
crisp
unfinishable
with
5
of
us
rest
for
cooking
burgers
some
bitter
aftertaste
currently
in
the
english
bitter
category
but
i
cant
say
it
fits
in
very
well
too
light
in
color
and
the
hop
profile
doesnt
fuit
more
of
a
summer
ale
as
stated
on
the
bottle
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
a
nice
ale
alternative
to
the
standard
pale
lager
notes
this
beer
certainly
looked
good
but
the
taste
is
lacking
it
was
much
better
once
it
warmed
up
the
bitter
flavour
really
comes
through
at
warmer
temperatures
pours
out
a
clear
honey
color
with
a
huge
head
that
took
a
little
bit
to
settle
down
smell
consisted
of
grass
some
citrus
notes
slight
malt
breaddough
aromas
and
some
slight
spiciness
cloves
mostly
taste
was
a
little
light
some
hops
and
malts
blend
in
and
out
throughout
the
entire
time
some
lemon
flavors
kick
in
towards
the
aftertaste
but
finishes
quite
dry
a
little
too
dry
for
this
beer
but
it
was
quite
creamy
which
was
a
nice
bonus
but
other
than
that
skip
this
beer
bottle
poured
a
gold
colored
beer
with
a
standard
head
with
above
average
retention
carbonation
is
quite
good
and
body
is
a
bit
thin
aroma
is
lovely
with
a
mix
of
floral
hops
and
nice
strong
malt
taste
is
very
refreshing
with
some
sweetness
kicking
first
and
ending
with
a
slight
bitterness
overall
this
is
an
above
average
english
ale
and
very
refreshing
for
the
summertime
in
the
end
hopback
summer
lightning
is
a
pedestrian
english
bitter
it
isnt
horrible
but
at
3
29
per
bottle
i
cant
recommend
it
either
im
tempted
to
say
that
a
more
appropriate
name
would
be
summer
static
electricity
but
that
would
be
unfair
although
amusing
clean
light
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
aroma
was
mostly
yeasty
bready
smelling
i
did
not
get
any
hops
in
the
aroma
in
fact
i
had
to
read
the
bottle
again
because
my
nose
told
me
i
was
drinking
a
lager
very
light
in
flavor
nothing
jumps
out
at
you
it
did
have
a
clean
crisp
finish
which
would
make
it
a
good
summer
time
lawnmower
beer
not
what
i
had
expected
drinkablilty
not
too
bad
i
suppose
a
bit
of
a
thirst
quencher
with
some
backbone
not
my
favorite
for
overall
balance
hit
or
miss
depending
of
your
mood
i
suppose
very
clear
light
golden
colour
with
thin
white
head
lots
of
fine
lace
on
the
glass
strong
floral
hop
aroma
with
very
light
toasted
malt
smell
plenty
of
citrus
hop
flavour
with
a
pleasant
bitterness

this
is
so
disappointing
compared
to
the
cask
as
if
it
had
fallen
from
the
sky
and
hit
the
ground
hard
maybe
these
were
old
bottles
but
having
been
burnt
twice
i
think
i
have
better
ways
to
blow
four
bucks
on
a
bottle
of
beer
summer
lightning
is
not
in
the
classic
mold
its
probably
a
rung
below
that
but
still
a
perfectly
drinkable
brew
that
will
hit
the
spot
i
can
see
myself
going
for
this
more
on
a
stinking
hot
summers
day
in
an
ice
cold
pint
glass
a
nice
refreshing
summer
ale
that
i
can
see
myself
buying
in
the
up
coming
summer
period
gentle
and
inviting
hop
aroma
deliciously
bitter
hops
from
the
word
go
lingers
nicely
on
the
palate
without
being
overwhelming
slightly
metallic
edge
to
the
finish
if
hops
are
your
thing
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
the
mossy
earthy
flavor
in
the
finish
is
offputting
and
i
feel
more
like
im
drinking
a
lager
than
a
bitter
the
label
of
this
beer
brags
about
the
awards
it
has
won
but
the
awards
were
6
years
ago
maybe
they
changed
the
recipe
maybe
the
beer
just
doesnt
travel
well
here
to
the
states
but
its
just
not
doing
it
for
me
if
someone
handed
me
one
at
a
party
i
might
drink
it
depending
on
what
else
was
in
the
fridge
but
i
wont
be
buying
another
one

better

of

that
keeps
your

moving

after
youve
swallowed
it
a
very

summer
ale
as
the
name
would
suggest
the
pale
colour
is
indicative
of
its
very
light
flavour

some
would
say
too
light

though
on
a
hot
day
this
goes
down
a
treat
sweet
and
hoppy
without
being
too
strong

could

its

the
foam
overwhelmed
everything
on

pour
the

thing
happened
long
lasting
rocky
with
great
retention
the
beer
seemed
to
be
noncarbonated
though

not
that
many
rising
bubbles
all
of
the
carbonation
was
most
likely
lost
in
the
head
the
color
was
a
slightly
hazed
pale
gold
the
aroma
was
strong
with
sweet
lemony
grains
and
had
a
light
and
fruity
air
about
it
the
taste
was
light
citrus
and
bitter
in
the
finish
this
is
a
lively
beer
on
the
whole
light
bodied
and
enjoyable
with
a
bitterness
that
sneaks
up
on
you
in
the

very

is

its

to
rate
on
the

alone
but
thats
that
with
that
i
bet
this
would
be
fantastic

of
a

is

this

is
probably
a

not
by

contrary

indications

in
keeping
with

all
i
got
out

maybe
the

this

there
is
nothing

away
from

this

i
love

not

im
just
talking

now
it

me
submit
my
review
without
posting
a
comment
i
need
to
get
250
characters
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
to
have
this
beer
again
but
i
think
people
are
little
too
harsh
on
it
i
had
to
get
rid
of
the
last
bottle
on
the
shelf
so
i
might
as
well
buy
it
myself
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
tawnyamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
faint
old
sourdough
and
what
may
or
may
not
be
a
hint
grass
depending
on
whether
or
not
im
actually
just
smelling
the
air
outside
somehow
the
taste
pretty
much
echoes
the
smell
though
now
its
just
generic
barley
and
generic
white
bread
yeast
combining
to
form
the
most
milquetoast
of
all
possible
flavors
id
knock
it
but
its
not
offensive
just
insanely
boring
and
undistinguished
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
crisp
finish
overall
this
may
be
one
of
the
blandest
beers
outside
of
the
bmc
arena
its
not
bad
per
se
just
something
id
likely
easily
forget
that
id
imbibed
on
any
given
day
especially
if
anything
else
happened
that
day
beer
or
otherwise
o
not
too
memorable
id
still
encourage
people
to
try
it
to
form
their
own
opinions
but
im
a
big
fan
of
malt
characteristics
in
my
beer
this
one
was
off
the
mark
in
that
department
even
though
it
is
a
bitter
o
not
something
i
would
buy
again
interesting
to
consider
the
second
run
idea
but
in
the
end
i
feel
like
this
was
a
just
an
easycheap
way
to
put
something
out
that
beer
geeks
would
buy
once
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
overall
i
think
its
pretty
good
poured
from
a

the

of

presence
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
with
a
very
bitter
astringent
hops
character
very
sharp
on
the
initial
tongue
the
malt
backbone
literally
gets
buried
amongst
the
bitter
and
astringent
characteristics
tangy
roasty
aftertaste
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
very
interesting
idea
behind
the
beer
but
the
flavors
just
dont
seem
to
meld
or
balance
well
overall
this
may
not
be
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
quaffable
and
refreshing
and
i
like
its
partigyle
nature
id
love
to
have
this
on
draft
sometime
for
a
long
session
not
enough
malt
for
the
english
bitter
grouping
but
for
a
watered
down
foghorn
and
in
view
of
the
very
low
abv
this
is
quite
good
great
session
beer
dont
dive
into
this
looking
for
a
complex
gamechanger
but
itll
do
the
trick
if
you
want
something
to
enjoy
during
the
game
or
after
working
hard

it

being

as
a
remake
of
the
traditional
small
beers
that
were
widely
drunk
and
made
from
spent

from
that
point

the

be
a
good
idea
to
make
a
category
for
this
style
since
it
is
traditional
and
was
widely
drunk
at
one
time
im
rating
it
as
a
small
beer
not
an
english
bitter
although
it
doesnt
miss
that
mark
by
much
pours
a
nice
light
amber
with
a
solid
sheet
of
loose
whites
smells
of
peanuts
light
grain
sweet
toffee
faintly
some
hints
of
grass
flavor
is
bitter
up
front
some
of
the
peanut
flavor
comes
through
a
good
dose
of
cardboard
candy
box
style
some
bits
of
metals
medium
bodied
with
much
too
much
carbonation
and
a
wettish
finish
not
very
impressive
but
i
can
see
how
on
a
sunny
summer
day
with
sweat
dripping
down
my
face
this
would
satisfy
maybe
if
this
wasnt
listed
as
a
bitter
overallit
is
an
okay
beer
if
you
dont
want
to
drink
a
heavier
beer
and
you
dont
want
to
drink
a
bud
i
would
buy
it
again
when
in
the
mood
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
i
have
had
better
bitter
beers
overall
for
a
lighter
beer
it
is
good
to
drink
any
time
of
year
when
in
the
mood
o
despite
the
bittering
being
a
bit
more
present
than
other
english
bitters
and
barely
any
malt
present
id
say
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
its
about
right
there
for
me
im
not
sure
if
i
would
seek
this
out
again
depends
but
the
price
is
definitely
there
the
remnants
from
old
foghorn
leaves
a
shadow
taste
of
its
big
brother
but
sheds
its
almost
oily
viscosity
and
alcohol
complexities
for
refreshment
and
drinkability
the
beer
that
emerges
retains
glimpses
into
the
fruity
esters
and
malt
firmness
that
weve
come
to
love
about
that
barleywine
excellent
session
brew
small
beer
with
big
taste
indeed
can
see
myself
enjoying
many
of
these
at
a
time
if
needed
overall
probably
not
going
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
but
interesting
enough
in
the
taste
rjt
calling
this
an
english
bitter
probably
isnt
a
fair
categorization
doubt
i
would
bother
with
again
but
i
applaud
the
unique
effort
what
an
astringent
beer
not
particularly
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
light
spritz
y
and
refreshing
a
nice
beer
to
begin
the
evening
with
or
simply
enjoy
on
a
warm
day
i
have
to
say
the
local
magnolia
brewery
executes
a
much
finer
bitter
but
this
is
a
decent
offering
and
also
a
much
better
way
to
use
the
mash
from
old
foghorn
d
a
definite
disappointment
from
anchor
i
applaud
the
attempt
at
a
small
beer
though
the
final
result
is
a
failure
o
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
o
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
too
much
to
overcome
to
make
this
worth
a
repeat
try
dr
a
boring
sloppy
seconds
beer
that
is
neither
interesting
nor
worthwhile
this
is
best
left
on
the
shelf
this
chubby
bottle
thats
been
in
my
fridge
for
at
least
a
couple
of
years
poured
into
a
tall
glass
shows
a
bright
clear
amber
color
and
a
substantial
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
brings
to
mind
yeasty
pumpernickel
bread
with
caramel
malt
undercurrents
crisp
and
a
bit
skunky
like
some
pilsners
the
taste
brings
on
an
interestingly
peppery
wheat
with
more
yeasty
bread
and
grassy
edges
there
is
a
subtle
light
fruit
sweetness
but
generally
this
is
more
of
a
grain
brew
thats
a
tad
watery
but
has
an
effervescent
feel
with
a
light
body
its
interesting
kind
of
basic
and
not
a
bad
refreshment
mouthfeel
this
was
very
wateryeasy
to
drink
body
had
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
but
not
to
the
tongue
since
this
is
a
classic
bitter
beer
it
is
hoppier
and
brighter
rather
than
sweet
although
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
in
succession
oi
would
rate
this
beer
highly
for
its
ease
of
drinkability
it
is
so
smooth
and
refreshing
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
could
drink
while
laying
back
with
a
group
of
friends
a
simple
yet
enjoyable
session
beer
would
love
to
see
this
in
6packs
though
i
doubt
there
is
much
of
a
market
for
it
o
interesting
beer
dont
know
that
ive
ever
had
a
sloppy
seconds
beer
the
flavors
are
decent
but
the
thin
quality
is
apparent
watery
thin
palate
with
some
toasted
cracker
water
snapp
thanks
to
some
slightly
lemon
and
grass
clipping
hops
the
mnalts
is
just
a
faint
very
dry
maybe
even
bland
tasting
cracker
sessionable
just
not
flavorful
o
i
really
like
this
beer
i
know
that
it
is
made
off
the
seconds
of
old
foghorn
but
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
a
bit
light
for
an
esb
but
still
very
flavorful
i
will
always
buy
this
beer
when
it
comes
out
overall
i
think
this
beer
can
be
a
satisfying
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
it
can
also
be
a
satisfying
light
alcohol
beer
while
still
supplying
the
essence
of
beer
if
youre
after
a
hearty
ale
you
will
be
disappointed
o
this
beer
was
not
at
all
what
i
was
going
for
the
lack
of
overall
flavor
did
kill
it
for
me
about
half
way
through
the
beer
the
abv
is
perfect
for
multiple
pints
but
it
just
needs
a
little
more
flavor
and
i
would
be
happy
overall
it
is
a
truly
lovely
session
beer
though
could
do
with
being
a
bit
weaker
alcohol
wise
if
im
honest
pours
a
light
golden
color
not
much
of
a
head
this
beer
is
the
second
brewed
in
a
twice
used
mash
from
the
old
foghorn
barleywine
it
doesnt
smell
of
much
at
all
tastes
of
very
light
malt
and
barley
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
a
definite
session
beer
this
is
a
very
clean
light
and
easy
drinking
brew
the
bit
of
honey
drynessdisplayed
in
the
finish
and
hinted
on
in
the
aroma
makes
me
wonder
if
the
original
gravity
of
this
bitter
was
undershot
and
it
had
to
be
augmented
with
honey
so
it
wasnt
too
watery
regardless
i
understand
the
process
and
reasoning
for
small
beer
production
and
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
regardless
i
thought
this
was
bmc
with
a
little
extra
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
id
never
had
a
small
beer
before
if
this
is
the
norm
for
them
im
beginning
to
understand
why
they
arent
made
anymore
glad
i
tried
it
mainly
for
its
historical
significance
but
i
will
not
be
buying
this
one
again
its
got
the
unassuming
simplicity
and
low
abv
of
an
english
bitter
but
none
of
the
well
inherent
characteristics
therein
no
crisp
biscuit
malt
no
jocular
yet
reserved
hops
just
a
musty
kind
of
offputting
affair
any
relation
to
its
parent
beer
is
unfathomable
very
few
brewers
use
the
second
runnings
from
a
historical
and
environmental
point
of
view
i
like
it
today
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
which
is
tough
to
judge
by
style
but
id
happily
session
it
in
the
summer
heat
pretty
runofthemill
overall
ill
take
an
old
foghorn
instead
light
modied
mostly
firm
just
a
hint
of
lingering
bitterness
but
without
hop
flavor
not
bad
but
less
than
i
was
expecting
a
lovely
simple
balanced
bitter
good
use
of
the
second
runnings
and
a
very
nice
summer
beer
overall
average
but
refreshing
it
is
what
it
is
got
this
one
ticked
off
the
list
overall
small
beer
is
a
good
beer
and
for
a
secondrun
brew
is
still
far
better
than
anything
anheuserbusch
puts
out
i
do
find
the
bitterness
somewhat
out
of
balance
with
the
sugars
but
still
think
the
result
is
quite
palatable
and
refreshingthis
is
a
brew
id
like
to
take
to
the
beach
on
a
hot
day
t
this
just
isnt
impressive
has
a
strange
watery
sour
taste
that
i
just
cant
force
myself
to
like
strange
and
grainy
and
not
something
id
get
again
would
be
interesting
to
pour
a
few
ounces
of
old
foghorn
in
and
vice
versa
when
i
have
an
of
on
hand
taste
is
a
winner
a
bit
nutty
a
touch
of
earthy
slightly
herbal
hop
flavors
that
all
ties
nicely
together
you
can
certainly
tell
this
is
a
bitter
as
there
is
a
nice
tightness
lingering
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
after
each
sip
otherwise
the
feel
is
quite
solid
generous
on
the
bubbles
not
necessarily
refreshing
but
certainly
a
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
a
couple
glasses
of
for
lunch
or
dinner
for
that
matter
this
certainly
qualifies
as
a
session
beer
but
good
luck
getting
more
than
one
of
these
to
go
down
in
a
given
night
while
this
doesnt
lessen
my
opinion
of
anchor
i
was
really
disappointed
in
this
probably
one
to
skip
unless
you
want
to
experience
this
firsthand
and
as
much
as
i
hate
to
say
this
the
name
of
the
beer
is
truly
reflective
of
its
stature
mouthfeel
is
light
and
quenching
with
some
softness
pilsenerlike
yet
nothing
like
a
macro
light
this
beer
is
worth
trying
especially
on
those
hot
days
when
you
want
to
be
refreshed
but
without
the
high
alcohol
that
some
other
ales
can
deliver
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
this
was
an
interesting
brew
to
have
its
a
great
historical
brew
exhibiting
a
style
thats
almost
completely
lost
to
time
its
nothing
too
complex
with
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
small
beer
was
often
drunk
in
place
of
water
in
the
medieval
times
because
it
was
boiled
and
had
preservatives
just
as
the
style
should
be
if
this
were
in
sixers
for
about
7
dollars
id
drink
a
ton
of
this
o
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drinkespecially
given
its
low
alcohol
contentbut
theres
nothing
interesting
in
the
taste
that
would
want
me
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
yuck
im
sorry
but
22
oz
was
way
too
much
and
i
ended
up
just
giving
it
away
and
im
not
quite
sure
the
recipient
finished
it
either
pours
deep
copper
with
a
slight
but
sticky
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
sharp
the
flavor
is
very
bitter
masking
the
thinness
of
the
low
abv
and
general
thinness
of
the
beer
this
is
not
a
great
beer
in
a
general
sense
but
given
the
low
abv
it
is
a
great
session
beer
for
a
bitter
this
has
a
lighter
body
and
also
lighter
fizz
overall
this
is
a
craftlovers
sample
throwback
to
the
days
of
lager
yore
but
with
the
addition
of
the
bitter
sharpness
this
is
a
good
change
of
pace
serve
this
ice
cold
its
perfect
for
the
warmer
weather
the
pour
was
a
light
amber
colour
with
a
head
that
receded
to
abut
half
a
centimeter
the
smell
was
malty
it
smelled
like
good
malt
no
other
scents
were
detectable
the
flavour
is
strongly
bitter
the
delicious
sweet
maltiness
is
very
easy
to
taste
underneath
the
bitterness
so
its
not
overbearing
considering
that
im
not
a
fan
of
bitter
beers
this
one
is
not
bad
its
not
balanced
but
beers
that
are
supposed
to
be
bitter
arent
supposed
to
be
i
suppose
i
feel
like
i
can
taste
the
fact
that
its
more
watery
and
less
alcoholic
than
most
beer
but
maybe
thats
just
in
my
head
it
definitely
has
a
weakness
to
it
though
i
really
do
think
its
a
little
too
bitter
for
the
weakness
though
its
like
a
bitter
herbal
water
that
may
have
been
the
intent
but
im
not
a
fan
poured
into
a
pint
glass
darker
amber
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
foam
clings
to
glass
all
the
way
down
smell
is
very
mild
hops
and
malt
taste
is
also
light
again
hops
and
malt
with
a
mild
bitter
finish
this
is
good
beer
dont
try
to
make
it
something
its
not
its
a
second
running
beer
from
a
barley
wine
mash
i
think
its
a
great
effort
and
a
nice
lighter
beer
the
flavor
was
rather
bland
and
non
descript
with
really
no
defining
characteristic
to
it
some
light
cereal
grain
and
a
touch
of
earthy
grass
again
but
nothing
really
sticking
out
in
any
way
almost
forgotten
as
soon
as
it
was
sipped
it
was
a
nice
light
bodied
ale
with
a
decent
finish
not
very
dry
but
a
clean
finish
none
the
less
it
had
a
very
nice
amount
of
carbonation
which
was
the
only
thing
really
keeping
my
intrest
at
that
point
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
nothing
like
the
smell
there
is
some
malts
but
with
considerable
bitterness
a
bit
of
grains
not
bad
but
not
overly
pleasent
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
notes
for
a
beer
based
off
the
second
running
of
there
barleywine
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
not
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
it
was
ok
but
if
i
want
to
go
low
in
alcohol
im
much
more
likely
to
ask
for
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
the
bitter
is
flavored
with
a
hop
that
seems
slightly
woody
but
not
really
piney
more
herbal
tinged
and
some
gentle
apple
tinges
with
a
light
mineral
accent
from
the
yeast
with
the
malt
providing
only
a
smallpardon
the
pun
amount
of
flavor
i
feel
this
beer
does
what
it
promises
nothing
more
nothing
less
it
is
satisfying
but
not
really
a
beer
i
fell
in
love
with
i
guess
it
just
comes
off
as
most
small
beers
to
me
kind
of
forgettable
if
this
were
a
nonalcoholic
beer
id
give
it
some
applause
but
its
not
anything
like
a
creditable
english
mild
either
served
in
what
appears
to
be
a
sodafountain
fluted
glass
at
the
small
bar
in
san
diego
served
icy
cold
which
didnt
seem
to
make
it
any
more
palatable
22oz
bottle
from
a
recent
trade
thanks
to
whomever
sent
me
this
i
poured
most
of
this
into
a
17oz
mug
and
it
looks
good
amber
color
good
head
the
smell
was
kind
of
average
smells
like
beer
not
much
else
to
say
the
flavor
was
a
little
bitter
and
actually
pretty
good
for
such
a
low
abv
i
killed
this
pretty
fast
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
its
a
perfect
beer
for
the
afternoon
d
while
this
beer
is
certainly
attractively
low
in
alcohol
it
is
able
to
deliver
surprisingly
intense
maltfocused
flavor
whose
bright
acidity
is
most
appealing
in
the
presence
of
some
of
our
favorite
everyday
foods
its
flavor
profile
is
more
like
a
helles
lageror
its
steam
beer
older
siblingthan
a
bitter
the
acidity
can
come
across
as
harsh
and
the
smell
is
a
letdown
but
otherwise
this
is
a
beer
that
ought
to
be
more
common
than
it
is
drinkability
there
is
an
interesting
premise
behind
the
brewing
of
this
beer
just
read
the
label
but
i
probably
wont
be
drinking
this
again
they
claim
it
resembles
a
bitter
but
ive
had
much
more
drinkable
bitters
one
extra
point
for
conservation
of
water
and
ingredients
i
understand
that
this
is
a
small
beer
which
means
lower
alcohol
and
lighter
flavors
but
this
seems
substandard
to
me
the
flavor
is
thin
and
just
not
that
good
overall
this
is
the
bammer
check
out
rbl
if
bammer
aint
in
your
lexicon
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
very
light
and
at
3
3
abv
i
suppose
its
expected
overall
i
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
flavor
by
no
means
is
it
an
offensive
beer
but
it
doesnt
bring
enough
to
the
table
for
me
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
very
light
and
drinkable
it
would
be
a
good
alternative
to
having
a
light
lager
outside
on
a
hot
day
i
love
the
mouthfeel
how
it
tingles
the
tongue
seems
like
it
would
go
well
with
a
light
fish
smell
isnt
much
but
the
crisp
taste
makes
up
for
it
d
very
much
the
sessionable
ale
light
and
easy
enough
on
the
palate
and
the
sobriety
a
basic
mildesb
but
certainly
drinkable
enough
something
makes
me
wish
that
pints
of
small
beers
like
this
were
a
bit
cheaper
but
i
cant
complain
because
theres
still
plenty
of
craft
going
into
them
heck
with
that
logic
nonalcoholic
beers
would
cost
pennies
pretty
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
crisp
but
suffers
at
the
end
as
it
becomes
sort
of
coarse
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
3
3
abv
and
dryness
but
is
hurt
by
the
weird
middle
absence
of
anything
also
after
a
little
while
the
bitterness
builds
up
without
anything
to
balance
it
yielding
an
unpleasant
beer
you
kind
of
dont
want
to
finish
good
way
to
preserve
tradition
just
happens
to
not
be
my
cup
of
tea

easy
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
id
want
another
one
interesting
beer
it
looked
good
nice
two
finger
head
with
a
clear
golden
color
with
decent
lacing
and
retention
i
actually
didnt
mind
the
smell
had
a
very
dry
breadlike
grain
smell
with
a
little
malt
not
too
bad
reminded
me
of
the
smell
of
brewing
beer
taste
was
soso
i
didnt
notice
the
bitterness
too
much
it
was
there
but
i
didnt
find
it
overwhelming
some
dry
malt
lots
of
grain
and
very
earthy
mouthfeel
was
light
and
smooth
very
dry
aftertaste
overall
not
bad
glad
i
tried
it
but
dont
know
if
id
revisit
it
again
libation
i
cant
say
i
really
like
small
beers
as
there
are
other
low
alcohol
options
with
plenty
of
flavor
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
for
the
style
it
has
enough
flavor
to
make
this
very
very
drinkable
d
i
applaud
anchor
for
trying
this
old
technique
of
the
small
beer
but
maybe
there
is
a
reason
that
most
breweries
do
not
make
the
small
beer
anymore
so
i
am
torn
does
this
beer
taste
like
a
small
beer
should
or
not
i
do
not
know
since
this
is
the
first
one
i
have
had
what
is
curious
is
that
everything
but
the
color
says
pilsner

what
it

it
i
dont
get
this

a

maker
pale

a
totally
quaffable
style
of

what
could
go
wrong
apparently
plenty
pours
out
to
a
nominal
apperance
being
golden
and
amber
with
a
huge
head
of
billowy
foam
lots
of
lace
and
the
notion
of
higher
carbonation
levels
aroma
is
fair
mild
grain
and
sour
notes
of
hops
with
only
traces
of
maltiness
taste
is
askew
in
my
book
is
this
really
what
the
maker
was
going
for
mild
hops
give
way
to
a
cardboard
box
like
flavor
with
a
sharp
hint
of
malt
and
grain
that
goes
nowhere
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
and
the
expectation
of
carbonation
falls
very
flat
drinkability
is
fair
at
best
and
whats
with
this
super
low
abv
seriously
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
on
this
one
we
all
know
you
can
do
better
special
thanks
to
dubbercody
for
the
sample
d
well
the
idea
was
better
then
the
actual
results
frankly
im
surprised
they
bottled
this
i
would
have
liked
this
beer
to
have
succeeded
its
a
really
cool
concept
this
beer
seems
to
be
aptly
named
everything
about
it
seemed
small
just
not
enough
of
anything
i
know
its
more
of
a
byproduct
of
barleywine
but
it
is
still
a
little
disappointing
considering
the
high
quality
of
all
the
other
anchor
products
a
complete
lack
of
aroma
a
very
watery
wet
cereal
and
corn
taste
were
the
low
lights
it
did
pour
a
decent
color
but
carbonation
was
lacking
overall
not
impressed
at
all
i
expect
more
from
anchor
brewing
hence
the
term
get
pissed
cause
if
you
want
to
catch
a
buzz
you
will
be
doing
some
drinking
but
nonetheless
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
here
one
that
would
make
this
nice
with
chinese
food
or
fried
springrolls
very
disappointing
i
was
lucky
to
obtain
one
through
my
agent
who
got
it
right
off
the
brewery
loading
dock
three
days
before
i
opened
it
the
beer
was
every
bit
as
subtle
and
simple
as
a
good
british
bitter
a
light
but
noticeable
malt
presence
light
body
and
a
restrained
though
marked
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
is
not
a
beer
to
contemplate
gush
or
get
upset
about
it
is
a
daily
provision
beer
to
help
wash
down
every
meal
i
eat
after
1000
am
i
drank
it
under
the
sprawling
branches
of
trees
and
bushes
lining
and
enclosing
a
certain
length
of
sidewalk
on
my
walk
home
from
the
libraray
a
green
foliated
tunnel
of
spring
solitude
i
was
surprised
the
find
this
classified
as
an
american
pale
ale
since
the
neck
ring
reads
we
believe
you
will
find
anchor
small
beer
delicious
similar
to
what
modern
brewers
call
a
bitter
and
we
hope
you
will
also
enjoy
the
idea
of
reviving
an
ancient
brewing
tradition
which
is
something
of
great
importance
not
that
classifying
this
as
an
english
bitter
would
have
changed
anything
but
it
simply
does
not
seem
have
been
intended
as
an
american
pale
ale
which
is
what
anchor
liberty
is
this
pours
a
real
amber
color
with
a
small
head
the
color
is
nicebut
the
head
is
very
small
the
smell
is
lightbut
i
could
make
out
some
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
alittle
watery
with
malt
sweetness
to
it
its
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
the
flavors
are
weak
the
mf
is
light
and
the
balance
of
flavors
are
weak
and
watery
this
isnt
badbut
with
all
anchors
other
beers
why
would
you
buy
this
a
unique
concoction
stylistically
bland
in
todays
world
of
craft
brew
flavorsstyles
but
this
could
make
for
a
nice
springearly
summer
ale
i
was
excited
to
see
this
when
i
was
in
milwaukee
ive
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
awhile
and
it
seemed
like
a
cool
concept
pours
a
orangish
golden
color
with
a
large
rocky
white
head
not
really
much
lacing
flavor
is
hop
dominated
a
bit
of
a
metallic
note
in
there
a
bit
of
honey
and
a
touch
of
nuttyness
lend
to
the
malts
but
the
finish
is
quite
hoppy
with
a
fruit
bitterness
body
is
thin
as
expected
but
drinkability
was
still
not
too
great
low
in
alcohol
but
also
weak
in
flavor
and
the
flavors
didnt
really
hit
the
spot
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
im
going
to
be
spending
money
on
this
again
mouthfeel
is
very
light
almost
watery
finishes
crisp
but
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
slightly
comparable
to
an
english
bitter
but
not
the
best
tasting
beer
in
the
world
probably
the
worst
brew
ive
sampled
from
anchor
but
an
interesting
style
as
outlined
on
the
label
high
carbonation
hurts
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
this
down
for
such
a
low
abv
i
thought
that
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
character
id
like
to
see
more
offerings
in
this
style
a
great
way
to
top
off
a
night
of
high
abv
brews
edit
it
went
down
the
drain
youve
been
warned
huh
that
didnt
go
very
well
i
have
lots
of
respect
for
the
anchor
brewing
team
i
like
lots
of
their
stuff
i
just
dont
know
why
they
made
this
beer
not
sure
id
want
another
but
id
recommend
people
try
it
especially
beer
nerds
i
can
say
ive
had
a
small
beer
scratch
one
off
my
list
no
need
to
ever
look
back
drinkability
what
do
you
think
this
is
some
vile
stuff
stay
away
now
if
youll
excuse
me
im
going
to
go
a
pour
this
down
the
drain
pours
an
opaque
rusty
orange
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
sticky
lacing
looks
actually
pretty
decent
it
all
goes
swiftly
downhill
from
there
hmmm
says
its
made
by
recycling
the
mash
from
old
foghorn
barleywine
which
i
personally
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
macroish
maybe
this
is
how
they
make
macros
by
using
the
leftovers
of
good
beers
the
only
reason
i
picked
it
up
was
because
id
never
seen
it
before
it
was
unique
and
i
figured
that
if
it
was
from
anchor
it
had
to
be
pretty
good
i
wont
be
making
that
mistake
again
pass
on
this
one
should
have
its
own
style
category
a
bit
disapointing
considering
the
source
and
the
little
story
on
the
label
i
applaud
the
attempt
to
revive
traditional
brewing
methods
but
this
is
just
too
weak
for
me
but
it
does
have
some
cracker
like
aftertaste
it
is
better
than
most
macros
but
that
is
not
saying
much
someone
who
like
really
light
beers
may
enjoy
this
one
actually
it
may
be
better
as
a
really
hot
day
session
beer
but
there
are
better
alternatives
out
there
absolutely
crystal
clear
very
light
copper
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
fades
to
almost
nothing
smell
is
yeasty
and
grassy
not
much
like
an
apa
this
doesnt
smell
very
appetising
like
its
just
there
taste
is
skunk
malt
and
a
lack
of
hops
or
any
satisfying
flavor
this
is
recycled
ingredients
a
practice
that
should
be
reserved
for
bmc
beers
skip
it
stick
to
the
other
anchor
beers
notes
one
of
the
oddest
beers
ive
tried
in
that
it
tastes
really
nice
but
it
fades
so
quickly
that
it
is
hard
to
get
a
good
flow
going
at
3
3
though
this
was
refreshing
and
light
that
when
used
on
a
hot
day
it
becomes
more
desireable
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
it
has
a
bit
of
a
watery
maltiness
only
a
subtle
sweetness
but
it
still
has
a
bit
of
a
caramel
taste
to
it
plenty
of
a
spicy
hop
flavor
again
not
the
most
pleasant
flavor
but
it
is
drinkable
at
the
very
least
i
was
shocked
shocked
i
say
at
this
beer
from
anchor
i
love
all
of
their
other
beers
and
thought
this
would
be
no
different
boy
was
i
wrong
the
apperance
wasnt
too
bad
with
the
light
yelloworange
color
and
large
white
fluffy
head
the
aroma
was
of
skunky
hops
and
slight
wet
paper
cardboard
the
taste
was
dry
malt
adjuncts
and
nothing
else
it
wasnt
too
great
i
think
this
might
be
the
bottom
of
the
line
beer
for
them
which
is
very
weird
due
to
that
fact
that
all
of
their
other
beers
are
glorious
i
will
have
to
redrink
this
one
again
maybe
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
nice
foamy
head
dense
and
creamy
on
a
golden
yellow
color
body
the
smell
was
malty
and
even
a
bit
worty
with
a
wet
boiling
character
the
taste
was
crisp
with
a
hoppy
finish
getting
a
little
grassy
and
chey
light
hints
of
lemon
clean
pilsner
like
but
a
bit
boring
22oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
slightly
darker
golden
color
it
is
crystal
clear
with
a
small
slightly
fizzy
head
that
drops
off
quickly
the
aroma
kind
of
smells
like
a
mass
produced
lager
it
has
some
weak
hints
of
maltiness
and
some
floral
hops
the
taste
is
slightly
tart
and
bitter
with
a
light
malt
body
no
better
than
a
macro
at
a
higher
price
no
more
for
me
very
drinkable
though
not
remarkable
with
3
3
alcohol
you
are
still
getting
lots
of
flavor
if
this
were
easier
to
come
by
and
less
expensive
id
keep
a
bit
of
it
around
not
really
worth
the
price
though
ill
pass
on
buying
it
again
large
bottle
obtained
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
and
consumed
that
same
evening
june
2005
freshness
stamp
on
the
bottle
was
5fg
poured
a
thin
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
just
enough
to
cover
the
liquid
crystal
clear
light
rust
liquid
and
the
head
is
already
a
ring
around
the
glass
smells
of
diluted
chocolate
and
roast
grains
maybe
some
fuggles
or
other
british
hop
tastes
tannic
and
quite
hoppy
bitter
some
orangey
hop
qualities
that
remind
me
of
goldings
i
get
a
very
dilute
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
roast
but
no
hop
floral
there
is
a
grassy
dull
flavor
that
ive
tasted
in
2nd
running
homebrews
that
ive
made
this
beer
is
dry
with
no
malt
sweet
to
carry
the
beer
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
grassy
dryness
on
my
tongue
md
light
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
not
often
i
do
this
but
i
dumped
most
of
the
beer
on
the
lawn
not
good
all
in
all
perhaps
the
worse
offering
from
anchor
too
bad
as
they
make
some
of
the
best
beers
in
america
esparagus
the
one
veggie
that
i
cannot
be
enticed
to
eat
with
any
bribe
trhat
is
what
this
beer
tastes
like
to
me
i
wince
with
every
sip
the
malts
hit
and
are
sour
not
sweet
they
are
followed
by
even
more
sour
hops
not
bitter
or
aromatic
pours
a
nice
pale
copper
with
a
thin
filmy
head
aroma
is
at
first
malty
but
quickly
that
esparagus
comes
through
and
just
hits
my
nose
like
a
two
by
four
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
would
be
hgiher
if
i
didnt
wince
from
the
rest
of
this
beer
anchor
deserves
some
credit
for
brewing
an
obscure
traditional
beer
like
this
one
reading
a
description
of
the
process
on
their
website
leads
me
to
wonder
how
in
the
world
decent
beer
could
result
well
in
my
opinion
it
doesnt
just
because
they
can
brew
beer
from
the
old
foghorn
mash
i
e
waste
doesnt
mean
they
should
no
thanks
nice
to
try
this
finally
im
not
sure
how
much
it
cost
because
i
bought
it
with
a
number
of
other
things
but
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
and
let
the
opened
bottle
stand
for
some
time
to
degass
overall
i
was
surprisingly
impressed
with
this
a
very
nice
remarkably
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
little
beer
had
to
give
this
one
a
try
just
to
see
what
was
up
with
this
concoction
it
poured
a
nice
copper
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
left
lattice
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
hops
malt
bitters
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
some
hop
elements
the
finish
was
a
sprite
yet
a
touch
bitter
although
it
is
a
low
alcohol
beer
it
really
isnt
bad
a
made
a
good
drink
after
a
long
walk
on
a
nice
sunny
sunday
before
the
rain
starts
tomorrow
drinkability
taken
in
context
outstanding
is
this
a
great
or
even
above
average
pale
ale
not
really
but
if
you
think
about
what
this
beer
actually
is
for
a
minute
a
22
5
near
beer
rumor
has
it
the
listed
3
3
is
quite
optimistic
its
a
bloody
miracle
a
picnicgathering
beverage
you
can
drink
all
day
and
remain
relatively
sober
that
doesnt
taste
like
tin
can
full
of
boiled
cat
urine
wouldnt
drink
this
every
day
but
in
that
situation
i
would
definitely
go
back
to
this
one
try
it
you
might
be
surprised
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
concoction
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
color
with
a
medium
thin
eggshellwhite
head
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
toasted
malt
lightbodied
and
bitter
without
much
flavor
a
bit
of
earthy
malt
is
there
but
the
general
bitterness
is
all
the
beer
really
has
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
and
lingering
all
in
all
a
nice
throwback
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
grainy
pale
malt
scent
with
some
sweetness
and
a
slightly
fruity
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
very
light
and
watery
paleand
light
crystal
malt
flavor
it
is
loaded
with
citrus
hops
and
a
thin
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
concept
although
the
result
is
less
than
stellar
it
is
too
loaded
with
hops
it
has
a
really
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
an
average
drinker
its
one
and
done
for
me
certainly
not
the
best
anchor
beer
on
the
market
but
still
a
quality
beer
worth
trying
this
beer
would
work
very
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
thirst
quenching
i
had
no
problem
downing
this
in
minimal
time
edit
i
am
pouring
the
remaining
6
ozs
down
the
sink
dont
buy
this
one
even
sam
adalms
light
or
amstel
is
better
drinkability
couldnt
finish
this
beer
to
bland
and
no
taste
whatsoever
very
disappointed
in
this
one
i
had
lots
of
hope
for
this
one
but
no
dice
here
dont
even
bother
with
this
one
this
one
pours
a
very
light
shade
of
amber
crystal
clear
alot
of
carbonation
early
leads
to
a
puffy
white
head
with
long
lasting
retentive
powers
leaves
a
mess
of
thick
lacing
nice
faint
malty
nose
taste
is
the
problem
here
its
a
tad
metallic
sharp
watery
and
thin
the
mouthfeel
is
also
prickly
even
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
there
is
far
better
beer
out
there
this
a
noble
and
well
intentioned
try
from
the
good
folks
a
s
but
it
misses
the
mark
needs
to
be
softened
out
could
use
some
more
malt
to
ease
it
across
the
tongue
hmm
reading
previous
reviews
of
this
im
thinking
i
got
a
bum
bottle
or
something
then
again
it
is
fresh
as
per
the
bottle
code
i
just
spent
45
minutes
decrypting
as
such
im
going
to
have
to
say
that
i
just
dont
care
for
this
beer
overall
i
had
heard
of
this
but
i
never
thought
i
would
see
it
on
the
west
coast
but
thankfully
i
did
and
for
just
3
99
at
bevmo
not
a
massive
beer
in
any
sense
but
well
worth
trying
i
enjoyed
it
but
then
even
after
3
years
in
so
cal
with
all
the
big
ass
hoppy
beers
that
are
available
i
still
yearn
for
the
lighter
balanced
session
pale
ales
well
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
of
this
thoroughly
enjoyable
as
i
noted
with
heavyweights
gruit
awhile
back
i
can
appreciate
what
a
brewer
may
be
trying
to
do
with
a
particular
style
or
a
novel
process
but
i
dont
have
to
like
it
this
one
just
doesnt
make
the
grade
esp
for
an
anchor
product
ok
let
me
begin
to
try
and
catch
up
on
my
serious
lack
of
beer
reviews
recently
bomber
bottle
picked
up
at
half
time
just
a
few
days
ago
dark
orangehoney
gold
with
a
nice
big
white
head
of
foam
that
leaves
white
sticky
lace
nice
aromas
are
subtles
and
somewhat
subdued
but
they
consist
of
herbal
hops
and
light
honeylike
biscuit
malts
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
citric
burst
of
hops
near
the
finish
aftertaste
is
slightly
hoppy
but
almost
nonexistant
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
good
for
a
low
abv
brew
drinkability
is
good
and
this
is
a
good
beer
although
it
is
very
reminiscent
of
my
first
homebrew
and
not
quite
as
good
it
is
however
decent
id
run
through
it
again
aroma
is
a
mix
of
malt
and
hops
ok
the
flavor
is
where
it
goes
for
me
this
starts
quickly
with
a
nice
malty
presence
that
is
quickly
overrun
by
astringent
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
hops
just
dont
do
it
for
me
in
terms
of
session
beers
i
cant
recommend
this
one
as
much
as
i
would
like
to
cool
22oz
bottle
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
and
doesnt
leave
too
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
pilsner
malts
and
lager
yeast
the
flavor
is
very
pilsnerlike
grainy
and
subdued
flavors
with
a
citrus
hop
that
isnt
very
strong
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
pretty
nice
but
the
body
is
way
too
thin
the
beer
pours
a
very
clear
golden
yellow
color
wtih
a
3
finger
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
the
nose
is
actually
what
i
would
expect
from
a
pilsner
lots
of
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
graineyness
the
flavor
is
very
grainey
with
a
big
hop
in
the
middle
this
is
no
apa
as
the
style
on
the
site
says
but
i
dont
think
this
is
far
for
this
beer
to
be
put
in
that
style
small
beers
are
different
beasts
the
feel
is
thin
but
expected
to
be
that
way
drinkability
is
not
bad
at
all
either
its
nice
to
see
someone
do
a
small
beer
i
might
go
for
a
lighter
sweeter
hop
in
this
one
but
its
not
bad
at
all
i
expected
more
from
anchor
whom
i
have
a
deep
respect
for
way
too
watery
and
bland
for
my
tastes
ill
give
it
another
go
if
i
see
it
on
tap
i
couldnt
help
but
think
of
this
as
a
beer
of
lost
potentialthese
sugars
could
have
been
an
old
foghorn
pours
a
clear
lightcopper
color
with
a
pretty
white
head
its
got
a
pleasant
but
mild
grassy
and
piney
hop
aroma
theres
considerable
carbonation
in
this
oneconstant
bubbles
and
an
effervescent
mouthfeel
light
and
hoppy
with
a
grassy
grainy
slightly
bitter
taste
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
anything
outstanding
either
im
glad
that
anchor
made
this
brewits
interesting
because
of
the
brewing
method
and
the
lost
potential
it
might
be
decent
super
fresh
clean
perfect
beerbut
not
even
too
refined
either
interesting
yet
normal
normal
but
interesting
something
about
it
is
just
never
shallow
the
anchor
small
beer
is
not
a
beer
of
depth
and
complexity
not
that
it
is
bad
it
just
isnt
involved
you
taste
the
bitter
hops
you
taste
some
citrus
but
thats
more
or
less
it
this
beer
always
leaves
me
asking
myself
why
i
didnt
just
get
the
liberty
ale
its
a
good
beer
just
the
worst
of
the
anchor
steam
beers
and
not
worth
the
price
one
of
the
tastiest
low
alcohol
beers
on
the
market

dissapointing
anchor
the
producer
of
the
nectar
of
the

liberty
ale
produces
a
small

in
a
big

22oz

bitter
bitter
and
not
much
else
i
tried
this
beer
about
a
year
ago
and
i
tought
it
was
a
foghorn
lite
but
not
this
time
not
my
first
choice
for
anchor
products
the
fact
that
this
has
barely
any
alcohol
content
and
with
so
much
flavor
there
are
no
adverse
sideeffects
as
im
drinking
this
in
the
early
afternoon
and
its
incredibly
enjoyable
this
brew
poured
to
a
nice
to
an
amber
color
with
a
very
impressive
head
the
head
is
huge
and
very
dense
and
does
not
seem
to
want
to
break
down
it
leaves
fantastic
lacing
throughout
the
entire
experience
it
is
a
very
nice
looking
brew
now
for
the
rest
of
the
review
the
aroma
is
of
hop
with
highlights
of
malts
flavors
unfortunately
not
a
fantastic
smelling
beer
as
it
seems
to
be
watered
down
somewhat
the
taste
is
soso
the
hops
dominate
with
citrus
flavors
along
with
breadbiscuit
highlights
this
is
a
brew
that
i
did
not
care
for
that
much
i
love
most
of
the
products
from
anchor
so
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
me
not
one
that
i
will
get
again
the
name
says
it
all
a
small
beer
that
is
probably
a
good
alternative
to
some
of
the
other
light
beers
on
the
market
presented
in
a
dark
yellow
appearance
with
a
decent
head
smell
was
extremely
light
with
some
faint
hoppy
notes
taste
was
very
light
throughout
with
a
pleasant
light
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
was
just
there
very
unspectacular
good
on
the
drinkability
scale
due
to
its
light
nature
especially
in
the
abv
category
probably
not
a
bad
brew
for
a
warm
summer
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
ill
give
anchor
a
lot
of
credit
this
beer
used
to
be
heavily
tannic
until
about
a
year
ago
the
beer
as
it
appears
now
its
a
great
session
beer
a
drinkable
brew
very
good
for
a
lunch
beer
due
to
the
low
alcohol
content
the
results
after
bottling
i
sampled
were
good
and
plenty
drinkable
a
lightbodied
and
colored
ale
making
for
a
fine
session
brew
and
one
i
think
benefits
from
sampling
first
among
other
styles
ie
if
mixing
it
up
is
in
your
imbibing
future
pretty
good
foamage
as
well
as
the
alcohol
level
is
reduced
in
this
style
this
brew
is
a
clear
golden
color
and
has
a
good
sized
foam
white
head
light
grainy
scent
slight
floral
hops
as
well
this
is
a
very
light
beer
and
has
a
crisp
feel
to
it
some
slight
hop
bitterness
this
beer
is
the
second
run
of
another
offering
from
anchor
and
i
dont
really
see
any
reason
to
come
back
to
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
light
beer
this
could
be
it
but
it
seems
fairly
overpriced
for
that
objective
this
may
not
be
spectacular
but
it
goes
down
well
and
its
definitely
unique
i
have
always
been
curious
about
this
beer
and
i
actually
tried
it
at
the
breweries
tasting
room
color
is
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
faint
rings
of
lace
are
left
fresh
aroma
is
really
at
the
same
time
kind
on
non
descript
crisp
fresh
taste
that
is
almost
lager
like
good
finish
decent
hopping
i
had
heard
it
was
supposed
to
be
english
bittier
like
but
this
is
a
mysterious
brew
i
ranked
the
taste
as
good
because
it
tasted
good
refreshing
and
drinkable
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
thin
but
very
persistent
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
patches
of
lace
aroma
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
nutty
and
breadlike
malts
with
some
spicy
hoppiness
flavor
is
a
bit
onedimensional
a
lot
of
spicy
hops
which
dominate
any
malt
or
esters
that
might
be
present
the
beer
starts
and
finishes
bitter
mouthfeel
is
light
and
begins
slightly
overcarbonated
all
in
all
this
beer
was
a
letdown
i
expected
a
good
bitter
but
got
pretty
ordinary
beer
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
copper
color
topped
by
a
thick
wonderfully
long
lasting
off
white
head
that
creates
the
classic
belgian
lacing
as
the
beer
is
consumed
the
aroma
is
of
grain
some
spicy
hoppiness
reminiscent
of
an
open
field
the
taste
is
light
finishes
with
a
spritzy
bitterness
there
is
some
dry
grain
character
in
the
taste
as
well
the
hop
flavor
is
somewhat
subdued
which
is
appropriate
for
an
english
bitter
which
this
beer
characterizes
itself
as
but
there
is
a
nice
hop
spicing
which
adds
some
piney
notes
and
a
certain
zing
in
the
middle
of
this
beer
there
is
a
bit
of
nuttiness
here
too
perhaps
a
tad
too
bitter
to
be
spot
on
to
style
but
i
do
like
it
anyway
quite
a
clean
strain
of
ale
yeast
was
used
as
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
fruitiness
or
esters
that
might
have
added
a
bit
more
complexity
perfect
clear
copper
orange
pour
topped
with
a
generous
cake
of
foam
that
disappears
quite
quickly
light
sweet
grain
smell
brings
pancakes
to
mind
bitter
hops
are
detectable
as
well
predictably
the
nose
is
relatively
weak
straight
bitterness
hits
the
tongue
initially
with
a
more
complex
hoppiness
taking
over
afterward
malt
base
is
there
but
secondary
to
the
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
clean
this
one
goes
down
just
fine
but
is
uninteresting
compared
to
other
anchor
offerings
poured
from
an
unusual
looking
22
oz
bottle
its
orangishgold
with
a
craggy
head
that
remains
active
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
noticeably
hoppy
with
a
fairly
strong
metallic
smell
that
carries
over
to
the
taste
its
on
the
bitter
side
but
pretty
much
lacking
in
anything
else
this
may
be
made
with
the
second
runnings
of
an
old
foghorn
batch
but
it
tastes
like
third
runnings
id
pass
up
the
small
beer
for
miller
high
life
if
looking
for
a
session
beer
and
to
save
a
little
money
its
not
terrible
its
just
disappointing
for
an
anchor
beer
drinks
very
well
and
is
especially
flavorful
for
such
a
low
alcohol
brew
its
a
session
beer
all
the
way
and
a
unique
creation
from
anchor
a
nice
simple
beer
excellent
table
beer
in
the
essence
of
its
style
not
a
lot
to
it
from
a
brewing
perspective
its
the
second
sparge
of
the
grain
from
the
old
foghorn
and
moderately
hopped
into
a
second
batch
of
beer
pale
to
medium
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
malt
is
rather
lacking
in
the
aroma
department
hops
prevail
definitely
northern
brewer
and
maybe
some
cascades
in
the
bittering
i
guess
ba
lists
it
as
a
pale
ale
i
find
it
more
to
be
a
bitter
after
consulting
the
label
anchor
categorizes
it
as
that
too
very
hoppy
and
enjoyable
spritzy
carbonation
lack
of
body
may
heighten
this
sensation
mouthfeel
is
obviously
thin
slight
lingering
bitterness
paired
with
a
tinge
of
carbonic
acid
highly
recommended
as
a
low
abv
summer
session
ale
had
to
check
out
this
beer
just
for
the
concept
alone
and
it
was
very
dissapointing
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
trace
of
head
bubbly
carbonation
and
a
tinge
of
liberty
ale
like
aroma
very
thin
body
with
very
little
sweetness
i
dont
think
its
the
hops
that
make
this
bitter
i
have
a
feeling
its
the
astringent
malt
that
sticks
in
the
back
of
your
throat
flowery
hop
flavor
is
welcome
in
its
attempt
to
subdue
the
husky
malt
flavor
but
doesnt
quite
make
it
this
one
did
not
sit
well
with
me
oh
well
they
all
cant
be
winners
this
small
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
creamy
tall
offwhite
foam
that
persisted
and
left
good
lace
on
the
glass
there
was
also
a
nice
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
lightly
malty
slightly
sweet
with
some
floral
hops
and
breadgrain
aromas
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
bitter
and
floral
hops
that
lingered
pleasantly
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
very
dry
finish
almost
astringent
the
body
was
mediumlight
with
moderate
carbonation
feel
the
floral
hops
really
came
through
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
and
this
hoppy
punch
made
up
for
the
otherwise
light
body
this
was
a
very
nice
ale
and
at
3
3
it
is
quite
the
session
beer
i
wish
it
were
more
widely
available
in
my
area
update
it
has
been
almost
five
years
since
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
so
thought
id
give
it
another
whirl
in
2008
i
thought
the
aroma
was
more
pronounced
as
was
the
carbonation
it
really
does
have
a
nice
bitter
kick
at
the
end
i
raised
my
overall
rating
from
3
8
to
4
0
small
beer
big
bottle
pours
a
light
amber
in
color
with
a
tall
creamy
white
head
aroma
consists
primarily
of
citric
hops
and
malt
pretty
light
to
medium
in
body
malt
flavor
is
pretty
light
sharp
bitterness
from
the
hops
comes
to
the
forefront
midway
across
the
palate
aftertaste
has
a
lingering
fruitiness
to
it
interesting
concept
but
pretty
average
tasting
overall
not
one
of
anchors
best
imo
i
didnt
think
tastewise
this
was
the
most
awesome
beer
ever
but
it
was
pretty
refreshing
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
get
this
again
pat
flavor
is
initially
light
malt
with
a
trace
of
esters
right
at
first
then
tapers
out
to
a
floral
rough
hopping
that
dominates
the
beer
the
finish
is
all
hops
with
a
spicy
aftertaste
some
rough
grainy
flavor
in
the
finish
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
strange
and
interesting
it
tastes
pretty
much
exactly
like
what
id
expect
a
second
running
beer
to
be
like
at
least
worth
a
try
once
ill
probably
buy
this
again
this
was
an
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
very
cool
for
history
sake
though
poured
a
golden
hue
with
a
frothy
white
head
dissipating
into
a
sheen
across
the
top
definitely
bitter
like
in
appearence
smell
was
very
foreign
to
me
it
had
a
kind
of
leathery
smell
with
a
malty
kick
underneath
taste
was
refreshing
and
zesty
with
plenty
of
carbonation
a
decent
hop
twang
and
bitter
finish
in
the
back
of
the
throat
with
more
of
the
light
wheat
three
day
old
grain
flavor
i
cannot
fault
that
because
unless
i
am
mistaken
that
is
what
they
were
shooting
for
really
cool
and
glad
that
anchor
is
not
afraid
to
try
interesting
things
such
as
this
medium
orange
gold
color
head
is
smallish
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
skunky
a
light
bodied
beer
very
light
and
watery
tasting
there
is
something
not
quite
right
with
this
beer
not
sure
quite
what
it
is
but
it
aint
right
malts
are
way
to
mild
hops
are
way
to
astringent
and
it
only
2
3
alcohol
as
well
not
a
very
good
effort
from
anchor
mouthfeel
is
thin
finish
is
harsh
aftertaste
is
bitter
drain
pour
time
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
i
had
bad
thoughts
and
unfortunately
the
thoughts
rang
true
at
least
for
me
it
is
an
incredibly
clear
beer
with
a
stark
white
head
very
pretty
but
then
i
went
in
for
the
smell
and
it
smelled
like
a
watered
down
beer
a
light
hint
of
hops
but
smelled
similar
to
a
bud
the
flavor
was
bitter
and
lacked
in
intensity
and
complexity
i
just
found
it
not
that
pleasurable
of
beer
too
watered
down
and
bitter
to
be
a
drinkalotty
brew
but
perhaps
that
is
not
the
anchor
way
so
be
it
a
clear
deepgold
body
is
capped
by
a
short
and
lightly
creamy
white
head
that
drops
readily
to
a
thin
surface
covering
it
leaves
minor
spotty
lace
aroud
the
glass
at
the
start
of
the
pint
but
very
little
else
after
that
the
nose
offers
little
more
than
a
lightly
husky
malt
the
body
is
light
but
a
very
finebubbled
and
gently
effervescent
carbonation
leaves
it
nicely
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
offers
the
same
husky
malt
that
the
nose
promotes
although
its
not
astringent
and
a
firm
bitterness
balances
it
nicely
some
lowlevel
citrusy
hop
flavor
is
present
but
not
distinct
in
character
an
average
beer
there
are
many
better
beers
in
this
range
available
in
england
i
would
like
to
try
this
from
a
caskconditioned
firkin
however
additionally
with
its
lowlevel
alcohol
it
could
make
a
nice
alternative
to
nonalcohol
beers
or
soft
drinks
when
you
have
to
drive
one
or
even
two
over
a
period
of
an
hour
or
so
should
be
fine
and
although
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
throughout
an
entire
session
it
might
be
a
good
beer
to
switch
to
as
the
evening
winds
down
and
you
need
to
head
home
nice
looking
classy
curvy
bottle
the
beer
itself
is
also
attractive
crystal
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
mediumsized
foamy
white
head
soon
dissipates
into
a
lacy
top
aroma
is
grainy
hoppy
a
bit
raw
and
wortlike
body
of
the
beer
is
lightly
malty
and
finishes
with
a
fairly
strong
earthy
grassy
hop
flavor
aftertaste
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
citrus
very
dry
in
aftertaste
a
bit
watery
in
body
not
bad
but
not
terrific
either
overall
taste
is
a
bit
rough
on
the
mouth
for
such
a
purportedly
mild
beer
cant
think
of
many
occassions
where
this
would
be
appropriate
though
perhaps
it
would
do
well
next
to
a
pizza
or
some
other
flavorful
food
pours
clear
light
amber
with
a
fairly
large
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
good
time
then
becomes
a
coating
the
aroma
is
all
hops
and
so
is
the
taste
i
dont
think
its
a
biting
type
of
bitterness
its
kind
of
reserved
with
a
crisp
finish
the
entire
flavor
is
pretty
mellow
and
not
complex
that
along
with
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
great
session
ale
there
are
many
other
ales
out
there
that
would
be
easier
on
the
palate
as
far
as
a
good
session
ale
the
bitterness
of
this
one
becomes
kind
of
bothersome
after
a
while
with
the
crack
down
and
rightfully
so
on
drunk
driving
and
drivers
would
it
not
be
a
great
time
to
offer
small
beers
not
the
light
swill
macro
stuff
but
bodacious
ones
like
anchors
at
2
3
abv
a
great
session
beer
that
satisfies
the
thirst
and
the
need
for
a
great
beer
darker
than
i
expected
nice
subamber
with
a
very
thin
head
at
the
top
smell
of
mostly
hop
with
just
a
little
sweetness
bitter
but
pretty
pleasant
initial
taste
and
a
little
bitter
at
the
back
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
maltiness
in
the
brew
sparged
from
a
barleywine
wort
a
good
session
beer
anchor
applied
some
waste
not
the
smell
is
pretty
much
all
malt
and
in
my
opinion
not
very
enticing
exceptionally
light
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
a
wonderful
ale
taste
like
golding
hops
on
the
back
end
this
is
a
malt
forward
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
shows
there
is
no
reason
that
ales
cant
be
as
light
and
refreshing
as
lagers
are
i
would
like
to
hops
to
be
a
little
more
pronounced

down
easily
not

filling
very

not
the
best
representation

its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
flavorful
super
easy
drinking
and
fairly
straightforward
for
a
bitter
no
complaints
overall
this
is
a
completely
decent
bitter
but
it
doesnt
reach
out
and
grab
me
in
any
good
way
totally
acceptable
but
not
really
remarkable
dark
cherry
beer
with
little
head
after
pouring
into
an
imperial
pint
aromas
of
fruit
grass
and
bread
flavors
of
fruit
biscuit
toffee
has
a
leafy
aftertaste
with
its
subdued
flavor
and
light
body
this
would
make
a
fine
session
beer
were
i
ever
to
find
myself
in
an
english
pub
very
easy
to
drink
light
yet
interesting
a
solid
session
bitter
i
loved
this
beer
poured
a
nutty
brown
quite
a
bit
of
head
which
settled
down
nicely
taste
was
a
bit
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
nice
malty
base
with
a
trace
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
smooth
almost
like
a
nitro
light
carbonation
overall
very
wellbalanced
and
pleasant
not
super
complex
but
tasty
ill
definitely
look
for
it
again
a
lighter
tasting
beer
than
the
dark
color
would
have
had
you
thinking
going
into
drinking
this
14
9
ounce
can
of
cains
finest
bitter
mild
easily
drinkable
and
not
at
all
bitter
by
modern
american
standards
weve
all
become
so
enamored
with
hopbombs
or
maltbombs
that
its
nice
to
enjoy
an
easy
going
brew
like
this
once
in
a
while
this
is
a
sweeter
beer
and
many
may
be
misled
by
the
title
but
one
must
remember
that
this
is
a
british
bitter
and
when
the
english
use
the
term
they
mean
something
different
from
when
americans
use
the
term
the
taste
actually
has
very
little
bitterness
and
even
less
alcohol
its
overall
flavor
profile
may
be
a
letdown
to
some
but
it
is
actually
a
decent
session
beer
and
one
worth
a
try
every
now
and
then
when
you
want
a
lighter
beer
that
still
has
at
least
some
character

glad
this
was
in
a
can
as
the
light
flavors
would
probably
have
not
fared
as
well
in
a
bottle
this
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
but
give
me
something
bottle
conditioned
or
on
cask
or
hell
even
with
some
nitro
any
day
drinks
alright
but
not
too
memorable
i
would
like
this
bitter
to
be
more
bitter
otherwise
everything
about
this
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
seek
out
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
its
what
you
would
expect
from
an
english
session
brew
overall
not
a
bad
brew
structure
is
lacking
but
flavor
is
decent

this
is

english
brew
a
lucky
and
random
find
in
dallas
but
seems
like
this
and
the
dark
mild
are
the
most
populate
among
ba
very
drinkable
and
a
great
but
very
low
bitterness
of
a
bitter
great
pour
amber
with
a
nice
head
or
about
1
to
2
fingers
ive
found
that
is
not
consistent
but
its
more
so
because
of
the
glassware
nice
thick
but
small
head
creamy
nose
is
a
bit
subdued
first
and
foremost
toast
and
malty
hints
everything
comes
together
in
the
palate
as
a
low
carbonation
but
actually
great
feel
creamy
malt
beer
that
doesnt
go
do
heavy
his
a
hint
of
nobel
like
bittering
and
a
touch
of
apple
turnover
a
bit
roasty
nice
little
treat
and
rather
flavorful
silky
for
the
abv
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
slightly
patchy
ivory
haze
pleasant
aromas
of
sweet
caramel
malt
lightly
toasted
grains
toffee
and
earthy
hops
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
very
drinkable
overall
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
light
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
bitter
and
i
love
the
can
presentation
o
an
easy
drinker
but
nothing
too
exciting
which
i
think
is
expected
for
the
style
there
are
a
lot
of
more
flavorful
session
beers
i
would
pick
over
this
but
it
seems
alright
for
the
style
drinkability
my
british
friend
thinks
it
is
a
crime
against
british
beer
and
an
abortion
he
suggests
using
it
for
killing
grass
and
weeds
i
think
it
is
a
decent
canned
british
beer
it
is
not
much
but
it
is
drinkable
a
good
bitter
that
happens
to
come
in
cans
the
rather
lackluster
reviews
had
me
a
bit
concerned
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
ale
o
not
unique
for
any
particular
reason
i
could
do
really
go
for
a
hop
presence
and
some
sweet
dark
fruit
caramel
flavors
and
maybe
even
a
little
roast
however
theres
nothing
offensive
here
and
its
charming
knowing
im
drinking
an
old
country
ale
not
another
generic
lager
cains
once
again
brews
an
effortless
beer
to
drink
very
rewarding
in
the
full
flavor
yet
soft
and
elegant
enough
to
carry
and
understated
tone
from
nose
to
finish
where
intrigue
and
complexity
is
slight
refreshment
and
ease
of
consumption
are
high
this
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toasty
malt
with
hints
of
toffee
and
a
whiff
of
butterscotch
it
is
all
rather
faint
though
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
impact
than
the
aroma
there
is
some
nice
caramel
toffee
and
toast
notes
with
some
light
butterscotch
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
appropriately
low
carbonation
overall
i
really
like
the
flavor
of
this
beer
and
its
refreshing
quality
is
hard
to
beat
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
when
in
the
mood
for
something
on
the
lighter
side
i
only
wish
the
aroma
were
a
little
more
pronounced
close
to
medium
nah
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
it
is
so
smooth
and
easy
drinking
im
a
fan
o
the
flavor
isnt
too
bad
maybe
a
little
on
the
grain
side
taste
like
very
very
watered
down
whisky
very
drinkable
like
beer
flavored
water
rating
confirmed
on
42012
tasting
o
overall
good
but
maybe
not
great
still
a
very
enjoyable
and
something
nice
to
come
home
to
at
the
end
of
the
day
o
overall
pretty
mediocre
this
beer
is
a
deep
red
color
and
supports
a
modest
creamy
head
of
foam
it
has
a
very
mellow
and
pleasant
aroma
of
sweet
dark
fruits
and
the
flavor
is
similar
smooth
dark
crystal
malts
blending
with
classic
english
yeast
flavors
of
fruit
this
bitter
is
excellent
it
is
smooth
flavorful
and
a
bit
lower
in
carbonation
than
your
average
style
a
great
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
ale
o
a
superb
beer
overall
at
4
you
can
drink
a
ton
of
these
in
a
day
and
with
its
flavor
you
wont
complain
definitely
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
o
cains
best
was
a
decent
selection
with
no
remarkably
good
or
bad
characteristics
its
an
average
brew
on
the
whole
it
is
a
bit
flat
looking
not
much
head
the
aoma
is
a
little
weak
but
improving
with
warmth
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
like
the
flat
look
but
nice
and
bitter
overall
its
pretty
drinkable
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
repeat
a
clear
dark
amber
body
with
a
thin
tan
cap
that
has
a
creamy
texture
to
it
smell
and
taste
are
close
to
the
same
nose
is
made
up
of
grains
and
malts
with
a
slight
fruit
smell
in
the
background
taste
is
the
same
with
the
only
difference
being
the
bitterness
its
not
overpowering
just
a
sharp
bite
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
with
no
hop
or
alochol
presence
overall
this
could
have
its
place
on
a
hot
day
while
doing
yard
work
or
fishing
for
some
people
but
not
me
not
much
going
on
with
this
beer
so
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
another
overall
due
to
questions
and
allegations
made
against
its
character
this
cain
suspended
its
now
washed
out
flavor
campaign
a
soso
beer
but
the
abv
is
definitely
appreciated
woodychandler
comes
through
again
with
yet
another
canned
beer
this
guy
is
unstopable
poured
from
a
14
9
oz
can
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
grains
and
malts
taste
is
also
mild
some
grains
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
mediocre
beer
the
crack
also
evidenced
a
minor
offgassing
of
co2
but
nothing
like
the
previous
dark
mild
the
glug
had
some
cascading
action
but
nothing
like
the
dark
mild
i
had
best
stop
thinking
about
one
vs
the
other
or
this
review
will
be
seriously
flawed
i
had
a
mere
finger
of
thick
tawny
head
when
i
was
done
like
a
crown
atop
the
head
of
the
beer
the
color
was
a
glorious
deepamber
with
nequality
clarity
and
the
bupgoo
allusion
definitely
applied
nose
had
a
grassy
quality
that
reminded
me
of
drying
mown
grass
in
the
summertime
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
grassy
hoppiness
that
was
very
tasty
on
the
tongue
it
was
bitter
but
not
quite
bitter
enough
for
this
selfavowed
hophead
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
and
given
its
relatively
low
abv
i
could
make
an
afternoon
of
it
if
i
had
to
but
there
may
be
better
choices
available
i
see
that
cains
cans
three
other
beers
and
i
am
game
if
anyone
wants
to
ship
them
my
way
hint
hint
o
a
very
mediocre
effort
its
kind
of
like
drinking
a
darker
version
of
boddingtons
pub
ale
extremely
boring
and
lacking
in
complexity
o
meh
boring
o
not
a
caramel
bomb
i
approve
thanks
aaron
for
this
one
overall
impression
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
not
something
i
would
go
back
to
though
not
enough
flavor
or
body
throughout
you
could
almost
chug
the
whole
pitcher
of
it
and
still
want
another
one
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
but
wouldnt
recommend
to
anyone
im
friends
with
only
different
thing
that
had
at
this
sports
bar
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
hazelnut
brown
coloring
with
a
low
profile
tiny
bubbled
dense
frothy
head
good
cascade
when
you
pour
medium
aromas
of
nut
sweetness
a
slight
roasting
and
an
overall
effervescence
flavors
are
light
with
a
toffee
and
slight
caramel
sweetness
a
roasted
backbone
and
a
slight
hopping
that
gives
the
beers
palate
a
crisp
endfeel
the
afteraste
has
a
slight
linger
to
the
sweet
blend
of
flavors
and
a
very
slow
and
light
drying
finish
this
beer
has
a
very
low
abv
of
4
making
it
extremely
sessionable
from
the
can
12408344
may

it
pours
a
deep
medium
dark
amber
with
virtually
no
head
but
fine
clarity
there
is
an
abundance
of
caramel
malt
and
sugar
sweet
mash
in
the
mix
but
really
nothing
extraordinary
the
body
runs
in
the
thin
to
medium
range
the
taste
is
more
sweet
than
anything
else
with
the
bitterness
there
but
slightly
downplayed
i
could
picture
myself
sitting
in
an
english
pub
and
quaffing
a
bunch
of
these
a
drowning
your
sorrows
in
your
beer
kind
of
beer
to
me
this
is
an
average
to
above
average
bitter
compared
to
what
is
available
here
is
the
states
i
like
the
low
abv
and
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
these
overall
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
at
only
4
abv
and
a
great
deal
of
malt
flavor
not
watery
at
all
lighter
body
with
some
soft
carbonation
alcohol
isnt
even
mentioned
here
making
for
a
great
session
beer
the
flavor
is
okay
mostly
biscuit
some
hops
and
metal
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
slightly
creamy
just
a
typical
session
beer
if
you
dont
wanna
fill
up
i
like
this
bitter
maybe
its
the
mouthfeel
and
then
again
maybe
the
fact
that
its
4
2
and
just
as
flavorful
as
something
higher
in
abv
is
a
huge
plus
in
my
book
finally
found
a
single
can
o
this
sos
i
could
try
it
without
too
much
fiscal
pain
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
russet
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
cashews
light
rye
bread
grass
light
wood
light
biscuits
and
light
greens
the
taste
holds
notes
of
watereddown
maple
syrup
watereddown
coffee
watereddown
cocoa
light
wood
light
greens
tea
nuts
and
a
bit
of
toffee
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
creamy
feel
overall
a
pretty
solid
bitter
nothing
too
amazing
but
a
true
session
beer
for
the
most
part
that
can
easily
be
used
as
such
not
bad
really
indeed
a
bit
mild
on
all
counts
not
much
complexity
so
its
a
bit
of
yawn
overall
tall
can
into
pint
glass
split
with
a
friend
a
little
on
the
dark
side
missing
some
of
that
bitter
brightness
nothing
too
special
in
the
nose
but
its
fairly
clean
taste
is
not
bitter
enough
by
any
means
nothing
objectionable
here
but
not
much
depth
or
pizazz
mouthfeel
is
fine
not
too
energetic
but
not
seriously
flawed
eh
its
ok
just
not
spectacular
overall
wanted
so
badly
to
like
this
their
dark
mild
is
actually
pretty
good
and
my
last
trip
to
england
has
left
me
desperate
until
i
get
better
at
homebrewing
for
really
tasty
englishstyle
session
beers
imported
or
domestic
in
the
end
this
tastes
only
a
few
shades
better
than
the
2
5
sainsburys
bitter
i
had
in
gateshead
99p
for
a
4pk
of
tallboys
at
1
99
a
can
this
isnt
something
i
see
myself
returning
to
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
a
best
bitter
a
style
which
is
hard
to
come
by
in
the
us
id
really
like
to
try
this
beer
unfiltered
and
cask
conditioned
do
not
drink
this
beer
cold
the
character
of
the
ale
really
improved
as
my
glass
warmed
up
o
a
decent
example
of
an
english
bitter
overall
a
good
session
beer
overall
i
like
this
pub
beer
can
have
a
lot
and
still
drive
d
alright
for
a
one
off
try
i
suppose
but
dont
bother
having
seconds
i
have
never
really
been
a
fan
of
cains
beers
but
seeing
as
this
was
the
only
beer
they
has
available
had
to
try
it
out
md
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
lightbodied
bitterness
lingers
good
backbone
of
dryish
fruity
hops
a
different
bitter
from
the
usual
treats
of
bitters
from
the
southern
counties
in
my
local
pubs
overall
a
very
nice
english
bitter
chestnuty
amber
with
ruby
edges
almost
no
head
as
always
with
these
ere
beers
aromas
are
fresh
floral
hops
and
biscuity
malts
the
taste
is
hoppy
slightly
bitter
and
malty
on
the
finish
to
smooth
it
all
out
mouthfeel
is
cask
and
lovely
but
a
bit
light
to
my
tongue
and
so
the
drinkability
does
suffer
a
bit
because
of
this
lack
of
dimension
this
is
like
a
lighter
version
of
the
ipa
not
quite
as
good
but
still
bloody
excellent
im
really
happy
about
the
second
development
and
split
about
the
first
the
beer
is
still
quite
bitter
but
it
now
lacks
the
slap
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
that
so
stunned
me
when
i
first
tried
it
a
dozen
years
ago
i
like
intense
bitterness
but
its
not
for
everybody
so
i
guess
the
decision
to
down
the
bitterness
makes
sense
yeah
that
sounds

are
uninspired

enough
but
doesnt

no

by

but
no
the
bottle
is
the
best
about
this
beer
imo
a
decent
and
competent
bitter
a
real
decent
pint
not
alf
above
average
and
a
pleasant
session
bitter
to
have
all
night
would
need
some
crisps
and
nuts
though
if
i
was
to
stay
on
it
for

long
d
very
good

the

particularly
in

o
alright
for

no
more
after
that
before
losing
interest
im
unsure
why
but
i
like
the
bottles
of
st
peters
reminds
me
of
a
medical
flask
pours
out
coppery
with
no
head
to
speak
of
their
are
a
few
bubbles
but
no
real
foam
it
actually
looked
a
bit
like
the
bubbles
you
get
from
soapy
water
not
impressed
bit
of
an
earthy

some

nothing
really
remarkable
toasty
flavour
with
a
bit
of
earthy
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
a
rather
plain
bitter
nothing
necessarily
wrong
but
their
is
no
factor
that
would
make
me
come
back
for
another
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
color
ale
with
a
small
bubbly
head
that
disappeared
way
too
quickly
aroma
of
grainy
unrefined

is
not
the
most
interesting
taste
is
also
dominated
by
this
unrefined
grainy
taste
with
a
dry

carbonation
is
very
low
with
no
noticeable

very
uninteresting
and
boring
pretty

light

i
still
prefer
the

that

my

a
really
nice
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
label
light
and
bitter
d
quite
drinkable
i
was
pleasantly
somewhat
surprisingly
impressed
with
st
peters
best

considering
the
long
journey
this
bottle
has
endured
and
the
fact
that
this
style
doesnt
travel
well
its
probably
the
closest
thing
to
a
true
english

ive
had
this

was

light
amount
of
malts
hit
first
with
an
undertone
of
citrus
flavors
and
caramel
a
little
dosage
of
burnt
flavors
also
come
up
i
was
expecting
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
mix
in
but
it
was
light
as
well
wasnt
as
creamy
as
i
expected
it
to
be
just
a
strange
verison
pours
a
nice
bronze
with
a
soapylike
head
that
is
gone
in
a
flashlight
aroma
i
get
a
little
brown
sugar
and
fruitiness
very
english
taste
is
very
subtle
lightly
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
little
minty
flavor
that
comes
out
as
i
drink
more
a
little
watery
in
the
mouthfeel
though
makes
its
mouthfeel
get
a
low
grad
but
a
real
quaffer
something
to
drink
alot
of
true
to
the
style
and
a
great
bottle
for
my
collection
appearance
amber
brown
with
a
bit
o
head
which
depleats
in
a
hurry
to
just
a
bit
of
ring
with
no
lace
really
smell
is
spicy
and
chocolaty
much
like
some
stouts
ive
had
hints
of
apple
and
coffee
round
out
the
smell
taste
is
a
bit
burnt
with
some
fruits
and
a
bit
of
bitter
but
not
a
whole
lot
kind
of
non
descript
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
with
not
enough
carbonation
which
makes
it
feel
meager
and
unimposing
in
the
mouth
its
certainly
drinkable
but
not
the
greatest
pouring
noisily
out
of
its
uniquelyshaped
oversized
medicine
bottle
this
english
bitter
is
a
deep
clear
reddish
amber
and
it
it
topped
with
only
a
modest
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
buttered
popcorn
with
a
hoppy
backbone
the
taste
is
initially
light
and
smoky
with
undercurrents
of
cherry
and
grapefruit
it
then
lingers
on
the
palate
and
finishes
with
more
subtle
bitterness
than
i
anticipated
with
a
medium
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
only
a
touch
of
carbopnation
this
brew
goes
down
smoothly
i
love
the
st
peters
bottles
and
the
beers
are
always
quite
tasty
unfortunately
they
suffer
from
green
glass
syndrome
and
dont
do
so
well
with
light
at
least
the
new
bottles
are
more
brownish
i
just
wish
i
could
be
assured
of
freshness
ill
rereview
upon
attaining
a
fresh
sample
of
course
this
beer
brought
back
lots
of
memories
from
my
two
years
at
oxford
it
poured
a
clear
copper
tone
under
a
very
thin
off
white
head
that
disappeared
quite
quickly
theres
the
typically
strong
barley
and
flowery
hops
in
the
nose
the
mouth
was
surprisingly
prickly
the
price
one
pays
for
bottling
i
guess
and
mediumbodied
the
taste
was
just
how
i
remember
the
bitters
in
my
favorite
pubs
just
a
bit
sour
theres
lots
of
malt
at
first
chased
by
an
excellent
hoppy
bite
the
aftertaste
is
mainly
bitter
with
just
a
touch
of
malt
in
the
background
great
example
of
the
style
notes
nice
drinkability
fresh
tasting
bitter
the
carbonation
and
head
level
is
reminiscent
of
a
hand
pulled
bitter
not
an
extraordinary
beer
but
it
is
very
clean
with
a
nice
flavor
and
finish
session
quality
1pt
9
oz
bottle
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
very
little
head
even
with
an
agressive
pour
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
only
aroma
i
could
detect
was
tea
as
in
a
cup
of
tea
taste
starts
out
with
low
carbonation
then
comes
the
bitter
which
is
followed
by
a
nice
sweetness
in
the
finish
not
the
best
bitter
ive
had
but
still
enjoyable
st
peters
site
has
two
bitters
the
organic
is
brewed
with
chariot
malted
barley
and
organically
grown
hallertau
hops
this
is
brewed
with
pale
and
crystal
malts
and
goldings
aroma
hops
pours
with
a
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
a
lace
it
finishes
bitter
imagine
that
but
there
is
a
sweet
caramel
nose
tasteless
has
no
oomph
looks
cloudy
and
amazing
doesnt
deliver
on
anything
other
than
that
o
pretty
good
delicious
but
a
little
weak
in
abv
for
me
purchased
in
italy
really
underwhelmed
by
this
red
ale
i
expected
much
more
just
based
on
how
good
the
cream
stout
is
this
one
falls
a
bit
flat
of
that
mark
but
my
bottle
may
not
have
been
stored
or
handled
properly
so
that
could
be
a
factor
no
bottle
date
to
check
either
frothy
brick
red
color
pretty
clear
glowing
darker
amber
the
nose
is
stale
english
malt
muted
and
dusty
not
real
appealing
and
the
yeast
seems
weird
in
it
like
bread
dough
or
something
unfinished
notes
of
oatmeal
and
sweeter
red
malt
on
the
front
end
and
barley
a
bittering
hop
to
finish
i
like
the
mouthfeel
pretty
well
real
frothy
and
sturdy
especially
for
a
beer
so
low
in
alcohol
but
there
is
a
weird
tannic
thing
running
through
it
and
with
the
staleness
of
the
grain
i
really
dont
care
much
for
it
i
love
their
packaging
i
find
it
distinct
and
alluring
but
if
these
green
bottles
are
responsible
for
light
struck
beer
im
not
a
fan
anymore
this
bottle
exhibited
those
properties
for
sure
i
will
revisit
this
again
when
i
can
guarantee
its
freshness
overall
a
drinkable
and
tasty
bitter
perhaps
i
should
go
to
britain
and
attempt
to
quaff
a
few
of
these
down
the
local
pub
interesting
flavour
combinations
and
beer
liked
it
a
lot
but
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
seemed
a
little
out
of
place
or
wasnt
quite
in
balance
but
probably
being
too
picky
as
everything
else
about
the
beer
was
great
the
taste
is
of
malts
but
the
odd
chocolate
note
i
got
on
the
nose
is
not
as
noticeable
in
the
taste
a
kind
of
herbal
quality
too
the
ending
is
slightly
bitter
and
lingers
to
a
dry
a
finish
o
nice
beer
for
the
style
overall
this
is
very
decent
stuff
solidly
if
unimaginatively
made
and
providing
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
i
think
its
one
of
the
stronger
entries
in
the
st
peters
range
food
match
roasted
game
meats
like
partridge
grouse
woodcock
and
venison
also
roasted
wild
pig
on
a
spit
would
lend
its
medieval
feel
to
the
brew
overall
not
my
favorite
red
ale
but
at
4
3
this
beer
packs
in
a
lot
of
flavor
i
like
the
hint
of
cherry
tart
but
could
use
just
a
bit
more
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
red
ale
and
would
buy
it
again
o
good
example
of
the
style
love
the
18th
century
oval
bottle
too
a
good
example
of
style
and
more
importantly
has
travelled
well
would
be
very
sessionable
but
not
at
the
price
really
good
example
of
a
moderately
flavoured
beer
well
made
mouthfeel
slightly
dry
finish
but
this
makes
you
want
more
drinkability
its
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
put
together
with
ideal
carbonation
and
a
real
warming
mouth
feel
that
is
not
at
all
heavy
it
produces
a
splendid
dark
bitter
for
the
darker
days
d
id
definitely
agree
with
most
critics
that
this
ale
is
enduringly
bitter
even
for
a
bitter
but
i
personally
find
that
the
complex
flavour
profile
stands
up
to
it
besides
its
anything
but
a
traditional
bitter
its
distinctly
unorthodox
rather
sophisticated
and
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
in
autumn
or
winter
wow
big
hoppy
chewy
red
yet
very
english
not
surprised
to
read
its
cascade
in
there
red
rockets
little
sister
tasty
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
was
going
on
with
this
ale
a
strong
malt
flavour
with
more
bitterness
than
expected
but
nicely
balanced
by
subtle
aromatic
hops
good
stuff
seek
it
out
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
perhaps
not
a
session
beer
as
its
very
rich
but
ideally
savoured
in
low
quantity
not
a
bad
beer
went
down
pretty
well
but
the
tartness
is
becoming
a
bit
overpowering
tone
that
down
a
touch
perhaps
on
cask
or
fresher
it
would
do
better
and
this
would
be
a
great
english
bitter
as
it
stands
this
is
merely
a
good
english
bitter
this
is
a
rather
nice
fall
winter
beer
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
really
a
nice
beer
nothing
particularly
exceptional
just
good
wellarticulated
flavors
in
a
balanced
deliciously
drinkable
ale
one
for
all
seasons
overall
this
beer
does
well
i
almost
falls
into
the
hopped
amber
category
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
english
bitter
what
a
great
ale
well
made
quenching
flavorful
approachable
and
satisfying
world
class
red
bitter
i
wish
i
could
get
this
all
the
time
living
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
st
peters
will
never
be
my
favourite
brewery
granted
they
make
an
impressive
array
of
fairly
decent
albeit
pedestrian
offerings
that
would
likely
be
real
treats
if
available
fresh
local
and
on
cask
ruby
red
however
like
seemingly
all
this
brewerys
offerings
shows
that
conventional
beer
is
rarely
all
that
colourful
mouthfeel
is
good
but
the
aftertaste
is
too
dry
to
be
really
enjoyable
overall
a
decent
well
made
beer
and
one
worth
repeating
too
bad
this
only
comes
in
a
gift
pack
in
ontario
or
i
might
buy
more
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
a
wellhopped
red
ale
it
would
hold
up
to
any
standard
pub
fare
and
would
be
good
for
a
couple
of
rounds
alone
but
the
hop
finish
might
beg
a
changeup
after
that
medium
bodied
with
a
lean
drying
sensation
d
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
the
finish
of
the
hop
bitterness
might
get
a
bit
much
after
a
while
but
right
now
i
wish
i
had
about
2
more
bottles
to
go
with
my
dinner
this
beer
is
quite
well
balanced
and
is
certainly
on
my
list
of
beers
to
drink
more
of
this
beer
pours
a
deep
reddishcopper
color
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
it
ruby
nice
offwhite
head
though
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
toasted
malts
and
herbal
hops
it
has
an
english
hop
aroma
with
some
spice
and
resiny
characteristics
not
bad
but
its
not
the
kid
of
aroma
that
jumps
at
you
the
taste
is
semidry
some
fruit
but
mostly
toasted
malt
and
hops
the
beer
has
a
firm
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
full
body
more
than
the
taste
and
aroma
lets
on
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
md
the
carbonation
is
just
light
enough
to
render
a
refreshing
texture
while
the
body
remains
medium
for
the
moderate
flavour
profile
overall
this
dark
amber
malty
ale
gets
rather
good
support
from
the
hops
from
time
to
time
showing
a
necessary
sourfruity
edge
to
balance
off
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
this
is
a
balanced
ale
to
me
and
id
have
no
problem
having
a
few
if
in
good
mood
drinkability
is
good
nicely
balanced
tasty
and
extremely
sessionable
i
bet
this
would
be
pretty
excellent
on
cask
mouthfeel
was
carbonated
and
light
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
wont
fill
you
up
and
you
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
if
you
wanted
too
i
liked
it
but
i
couldnt
stay
on
it
all
night

by

found

think
its
a

that

dont

carbonation
very
drinkable
not
the
most
flavourful
but
very
solid
this
is
lovely
i
wish
i
could
get
this
in
singles
this
one
was
out
of
a
gift
pack
d
if
i
had
regular
access
to
this
at
a
better
price

500ml
bottle
it
would
be
a
mainstay
a
highly
flavourful
beer
at
a
pretty
low
abv
pours
a
clear
deep
red
under
a
pinkish
head
that
couldnt
muster
more
than
12
finger
despite
a
very
hard
pour
the
head
fades
fast
back
to
film
and
thin
collar
but
still
manages
to
leave
some
very
nice
lace
lines
the
strong
floral
hop
and
raspberry
nose
is
very
enticing
the
mouth
is
mildly
carbonated
and
fiarly
light
strong
and
distinctive
taste
of
bready
malt
with
a
touch
of
peppermint
and
a
good
dose
of
espressolike
dry
bitter
hops
the
hops
last
longest
providing
an
intense
bitter
for
the
back
of
the
throat
must
drink
more
overall
an
average
beer
worth
a
try
once
not
one
of
st
peters
best
o
its
a
good
beer
even
if
it
doesnt
stand
out
all
that
much
the
american
hops
are
used
in
such
a
way
that
they
impart
flavor
but
not
the
aggressive
bitterness
that
have
come
to
characterize
american
beer
styles
drinkability
needless
to
say
the
dish
soap
quality
is
very
offputting
i
will
drink
it
but
i
doubt
if
i
will
ever
buy
it
again
fresh
bottle
pours
a
pale
goldenstraw
color
with
modest
white
head
nose
is
fresh
with
some
black
tea
aromas
grain
and
light
citrus
palate
offers
an
expected
black
tea
sort
of
flavor
soft
biscuity
malt
medium
carbonation
and
a
rather
clean
malty
aftertaste
citrusy
hops
mix
in
for
some
balance
but
overall
malt
stands
out
more
to
me
very
easy
drinking
delight
overall
the
fruitiness
is
almost
too
much
but
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
good
session
beer
very
dry
and
drinkable
nothing
exceptional
o
not
a
fan
of
the
nose
here
but
the
flavour
saves
it
somewhat
a
nice
drinking
pint
but
at
6
its
way
to
price
for
what
you
get
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
effortlessly
i
would
easily
have
lots
of
these
in
one
sitting
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
d
this
beer
has
a
very
light
flavor
and
a
subtle
depth
but
there
is
not
a
lot
of
depth
of
flavor
there
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
just
not
much
character
d
solid
session
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
for
the
english
bitter
fan
this
beer
was
a
special
treat
for
me
at
the
brickskeller
in
dc
it
is
very
pricey
id
call
it
a
full
flavored
bitter
that
is
very
smooth
with
an
unfiltered
feel
not
sure
if
its
unfiltered
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
bitters
but
give
this
beer
a
thumbs
up
and
a
recommendation
for
someone
looking
for
a
unique
import
ive
had
this
before
from
cask
and
its
much
better
that
way
this
one
poured
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
that
quickly
faded
and
no
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
aroma
is
malt
caramel
a
bit
of
toffee
and
hop
flavor
is
fairly
bland
this
bottle
was
in
my
cold
fridge
and
similar
to
nose
body
is
ok
and
carbonation
is
a
bit
fizzy
fiinish
is
like
flavor
and
short
usually
id
rather
have
another
brand
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
cant
imagine
finding
this
someplace
and
not
being
able
to
find
something
better
orange
with
a
slight
haze
with
a
thick
eggshell
cap
of
fine
bubbles
great
head
retention
and
thick
sticky
sheets
of
lace
fruity
aroma
tart
apples
pears
soft
malts
and
a
bit
of
citrusy
hop
spice
moderate
bitterness
fruity
up
front
apples
light
citrus
theres
a
bit
of
spice
towards
the
end
and
light
lingering
bitterness
its
drier
than
i
expected
which
gave
the
texture
a
more
coarse
character
and
seemed
to
draw
away
any
significant
malt
flavour
light
bodied
with
slightly
rough
carbonation
i
liked
the
aroma
on
this
one
but
it
feels
like
its
overattenuated
overall
xb
is
a
very
pleasant
bitter
that
goes
down
very
easily
an
excellent
session
brew
again
coniston
succeeds
but
for
me
i
would
have
liked
more
d
the
wellbalanced
flavor
along
with
the
low
carbonation
is
appreciated
more
with
each
drink
taste
is
crisp
but
firm
yeastycitrusy
mostly
lemon
and
zesty
light
firm
breadiness
faint
hint
of
pine
at
finish
and
aftertaste
only
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
maintains
the
character
wonderfully
feel
is
light
but
firm
solid
and
a
bit
lively
drinkability
is
incredible
d
not
the
tastiest
english
pale
but
a
cool
idea
none
the
less
should
go
down
effortlessly
in
quantity
d
not
a
real
standout
could
drink
many
i
would
think
but
not
sure
id
want
to
while
xb
bluebird
bitter
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
disappointed
me
in
comparison
to
the
normal
bluebird
bitter
the
appearance
is
a
light
transparent
amber
with
a
head
that
dissipates
a
bit
quickly
the
aroma
has
some
american
and
british
hop
notes
which
is
nice
but
nothing
too
spectacular
the
flavor
is
a
bit
generic
and
yeasty
for
an
english
ale
unlike
the
normal
bluebird
this
is
another
english
ale
that
makes
me
think
that
english
ales
dont
travel
terribly
well
drinkability
love
the
smell
but
not
the
taste
i
will
stick
to
the
regular
bluebird
bitter
overall
not
the
best
example
ive
had
in
the
style
but
certainly
a
more
than
respectable
one
check
it
out
if
in
need
of
an
english
session
fix
poured
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
a
clear
medium
apricot
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
dense
off
white
head
no
lacing
to
mention
smells
and
tastes
of
bready
grains
a
hit
of
caramel
malts
and
floral
citrusy
hops
lemon
and
orange
barely
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
bitterness
that
lasts
through
the
finish
overall
a
tasty
bitter
but
for
the
price
ill
stick
with
the
regular
bluebird
pours
clear
amber
with
a
thin
creme
head
nose
is
mild
apple
tones
and
bitter
edges
flavor
is
high
on
the
grain
tones
highly
bitter
feel
has
a
pretty
high
carbonation
liquid
is
well
bodied
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinker
though
it
is
slightly
intense
drinkability
a
good
one
to
drink
while
playing
shuffle
board
or
darts
at
a
bar
somewhat
dark
yellow
in
color
with
a
loose
and
fizzy
head
and
a
good
wad
of
citrus
provided
by
the
fruity
hops
somewhat
pungent
with
grapefruit
nice
and
light
in
the
mouth
and
with
a
lightly
bitter
tang
the
addition
of
the
american
hops
is
interesting
but
one
of
the
things
i
like
most
about
british
beer
of
this
type
is
that
its
not
overloaded
with
hops
like
so
many
american
brews
id
say
try
xb
as
a
curiosity
but
for
a
better
example
of
this
style
and
an
excellent
example
of
what
coniston
does
best
try
bluebird
bitter
you
wont
be
sorry
and
if
you
still
have
an
urge
for
hoppy
overlyspiced
pale
ales
buy
something
american
md
overall
this
is
a
lightlycarbonated
smoothenough
mediumbodied
pale
ale
that
suffers
a
little
from
the
intervention
of
the
yeast
sediments
clouding
the
overall
balance
bw
malts
and
hops
a
bit
more
than
what
does
to
the
traditionalordinary
bluebird
bitter
flavor
is
a
lightly
dry
lemon
zest
very
mild
cereal
grains
and
a
touch
of
biscuit
highly
drinkable
the
american
hops
dont
do
a
whole
lot
for
this
beer
and
the
brewers
notes
on
the
bottle
say
that
they
were
aiming
to
miss
an
apa
on
purpose
thats
where
their
dart
landed
this
is
a
very
sessionable
hoppy
for
the
style
bitter
id
love
to
have
a
pint
or
four
on
cask
good
stuff
great
drinkabilty
this
one
i
could
easily
session
on
although
id
prefer
to
move
on
after
a
few
because
id
think
the
flavor
would
bore
me
after
a
while
if
less
pricey
or
on
cask
this
one
would
work
for
me
this
is
basically
the
same
beer
as
the
bluebird
bitter
see
reviews
but
they
tried
to
americanize
it
with
some
late
cascade
additions
as
with
most
european
beers
that
flirt
with
more
hops
to
create
a
more
american
inspired
offering
this
one
just
doesnt
deliver
that
true
hop
character
we
yanks
have
learned
to
love
at
least
the
hop
heads
this
is
fair
play
i
suppose
for
all
the
american
brewers
who
claim
they
have
made
a
true
british
belgian
german
czech
style
and
also
fall
short
it
not
undrinkable
despite
odd
blend
that
is
ironically
helped
by
its
mildness
but
its
nothing
worthwile
imo
its
a
nice
idea
in
theaory
to
blend
british
challenger
and
american
mt
hood
hops
with
english
malt
but
it
doesnt
come
through
well
in
this
case
good
drinkability
but
needs
to
commit
to
being
a
pale
ale
a
little
more
to
be
good
its
got
some
potential
though
a
little
tweaking
would
do
this
good
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
which
maintains
retention
throughout
my
entire
drinking
of
this
beer
english
pale
ale
with
american
aroma
hops
is
what
is
stated
on
the
bottle
since
i
do
not
agree
with
calling
this
an
english
bitter
im
going
to
rate
it
according
to
the
english
pale
ale
style
it
smells
of
light
citrus
hopslemon
zest
as
it
warms
a
little
slightly
fruity
and
maybe
some
spice
smells
almost
of
a
hefeweizen
taste
is
not
too
different
from
the
smell
with
the
yeasty
hefen
flavors
comming
through
and
the
american
hops
making
a
fight
to
balance
the
malt
flavor
is
nonexistant
with
no
fruit
showing
all
in
all
the
taste
of
the
beer
isnt
bad
though
its
dry
and
not
cloying
at
all
with
biting
active
carbonation
citrus
and
low
abv
making
it
very
refreshing
though
it
is
not
what
i
woiuld
have
in
mind
tryign
to
pull
a
epa
off
the
shelf
it
is
ultimately
decent
and
interesting
light
fruitlike
sweetness
on
the
tongue
but
did
not
find
it
resembling
a
washed
out
massproduced
light
beer
has
malty
characteristics
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
light
and
spritzy
without
coating
the
mouth
i
thought
this
selection
good
for
an
early
afternoon
quaff
this
is
interesting
it
changes
a
lot
all
down
the
glass
which
i
could
admir
despite
not
exactly
liking
it
doesnt
bear
any
resemblance
to
the
regular
bluebird
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
idea
behind
this
beer
is
good
to
add
some
american
aroma
hops
to
an
english
pale
ale
this
bitter
just
seems
to
be
artificially
sweet
stick
with
the
regular
bluebird
bitter
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
dull
lightly
hazed
gold
with
a
nice
well
retained
white
head
that
inches
down
very
slowly
leaving
a
creamy
top
the
addition
of
mt
hoods
for
aroma
really
show
thru
giving
it
a
light
citrusy
character
not
robust
like
the
bottle
says
but
quite
nice
i
also
picked
up
a
touch
of
mineral
and
biscuit
sadly
the
citrusy
character
doesnt
carry
over
into
the
flavor
much
somewhat
dry
with
a
minerallike
quality
with
that
english
herbalgreen
finish
now
this
is
a
nice
bitter
the
aromas
were
very
nice
and
its
very
sessionable
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
oomph

the

taste
has
a

going

the

and

is

up
by

the
aroma
is

the
taste
is
just
the
way
a
pint
of
bitter
should
taste
with
rich
malt
tones
caramel
and
fruit
and
just
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
the
body
is
lighter

feels
fuller

has
a

smoothness
to
it
this
is
a

ale
it
says
it
on

so
a
careful

prevent

this
beer
is
a
great

simple

well
executed
english
brewing
an
excellent

with

at

disregard
those
scores
this
is
very
tostyle
but
i
think
too
metallic
i
like
a
little
more
breadbiscuit
in
my
bitter
also
the
lingering
bitterness
is
a
bit
too
strong
for
my
liking
its
golden
with
a
center
dome
of
white
and
a
brilliant
clarity
smells
of
sweet
malt
some
bits
of
crystal
malt
a
little
metal
and
herbal
hops
flavor
is
delicate
malty
nice
and
enjoyable
with
just
a
touch
of
noble
malts
medium
bodied
with
low
carb
and
a
wet
finish
nice
beer
quaffable
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
mild
herbal
hops
and
a
slight
tealike
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
earthy
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
super
easy
to
drink
due
to
how
mild
it
is
the
taste
is
also
malts
initially
with
a
fruitier
and
dry
hoppy
underbelly
pleasant
enough
and
my
first
beer
at
the
real
ale
festival
the
club
was
holding
a
good
solid
session
bitter
with
nothing
that
is
going
to
upset
anyone
with
strong
or
powerful
flavours
500
ml
bottle
pours
orange
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
perfume
hops
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
hints
of
fruit
and
yeast
body
is
full
and
smooth
taste
is
of
earthy
hops
sour
dough
and
some
fruit
finish
is
long
and
earthy
i
could
not
drink
much
of
it
overall
not
the
best
ive
had
very
easy
to
knock
these
back
but
this
beer
underwhelms
on
so
many
levels
just
ok
overall
i
really
like
this
it
is
a
superb
new
try
for
me
and
i
love
the
flavor
and
the
bitterness
i
am
a
bit
concerned
however
that
if
im
going
to
get
this
full
on
a
beer
im
hoping
it
gets
me
where
i
need
to
be
ie
high
abv
before
i
fill
up
unfortunately
im
not
a
light
weight
anymore
this
is
lightly
sweet
lots
of
pale
malt
flavor
not
complex
the
hop
finishes
the
beer
and
gives
it
balance
theres
some
sourness
and
a
touch
of
metal
iron
in
the
aftertaste
full
like
a
british
pale
ale
typical
is
overall
a
decent
english
bitter
nothing
more
nothing
less
feel
is
lightmedium
bodied
smooth
and
pleasing
with
the
carbonation
aiding
a
refreshing
moreish
feel
overall
its
a
simple
beer
in
in
its
own
way
but
so
well
brewed
its
deserving
of
its
low
key
but
respectful
reputation
in
the
uk
o
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
probably
the
best
bottle
i
have
had
in
this
style
im
used
to
drinking
these
as
real
ales
when
in
the
uk
price
point

than

im
always
skeptical
of
bitters
coming
from
englandsince
its
such
a
delicate
style
its
no
wonder
that
so
many
of
them
dont
make
the
journey
to
the
us
in
good
condition
however
this
one
somehow
manages
to
preserve
many
of
the
lovely
subtle
nuances
that
make
bitters

they
arelow

this
is
a
great
session
beer
i
initially
bought
hit
looking
for
a
random
english
bitter
but
i
think
i
may
come
back
to
it
again
also
fantastically
sessionable
seems
to
represent
the
bitter
genre
well
but
for
affordability
here
unfortunately
its
obscene
by
no
means
a
worthwhile
buy
at
this
pricepoint

a
500ml
bottle
i
am
awed
by
this
beer
i
think
it
is
world
class
if
this
beer
were
more
widely
available
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
i
wish
i
could
go
to
england
and
try
more
bitters
until
then
this
is
the
top
english
bitter
on
my
list
bravo
cheers
notes
bluebird
is
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
the
bottle
says
this
was
the
camra
supreme
champion
beer
of
britain
in
1998
it
also
says
the
glass
that
won
was
served
at
58
degrees
fahrenheit
my
glass
is
probably
around
50
degrees
this
is
a
well
made
beer
but
im
not
sure
how
much
i
like
it
the
strong
hop
bitterness
is
slightly
offputting
the
overall
impression
i
have
is
good
due
to
the
fine
aroma
nice
lacing
and
supple
mouthfeel
but
my
tastebuds
dont
love
this
like
they
do
for
ruddles
county
when
a
beer
makes
you
this
happy
its
magical
d
handpumped

left

slight

lightmedium
body
a

watery
and
thin
as
i
find
most
english
beers
to
be
but
generally
sessionable
and
easily
drinkable
o
good
not
outstanding
its
an
esb
so
bitter
is
what
you
have
to
expect
would
have
gone
well
with
something
barbequed
the
body
is
medium
and
it
is
indeed
bitter
but
not
puckering
this
beer
is
a
classic
example
of
this
style
and
im
glad
that
my
favorite
watering
hole
had
this
one
in
when
i
was
there
last
coppery
colored
amber
with
a
sudsy
froth
top
that
subsides
to
a
foam
slick
no
lacing
body
is
very
thin
and
undercarbonated
very
muted
nose
can
only
just
barely
make
out
a
tiny
hint
of
vague
generic
hop
scent
i
am
disappointed
the
thing
that
this
beer
does
do
rather
well
however
is
in
the
taste
there
is
plenty
of
long
drawnout
gentle
generic
bitterness
that
ebbs
and
flows
across
your
tongue
like
a
pleasant
ocean
current
now
that
that
part
is
at
least
well
done
if
not
overly
monotone
perhaps
as
an
effect
of
my
bottle
not
being
quite
as
fresh
as
it
ought
to
be
i
am
detecting
absolutely
none
of
the
fruity
notes
commonly
perceived
by
other
ba
members
and
this
really
hurts
my
overall
impression
quite
a
bit
if
nothing
else
my
curiosity
about
english
bitters
has
been
stoked
to
a
higher
level
by
this
brew
enough
to
potentially
revisit
the
genre
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
classic
bitter
especially
the
finish
is
great
o
overall
a
solid
english
bitter
maybe
not
enough
going
on
for
my
tastes
but
it
does
make
up
a
little
ground
by
being
sessionable
not
worth
the
fuss
or
price
tag
imo
there
are
much
more
interesting
beers
out
there
overy
nice
recommended
i
was
looking
for
this
beer
for
a
while
and
found
it
in
a
really
random
gas
stationbottle
shop
i
had
a
couple
different
bottles
and
the
guy
at
the
counter
commented
that
this
one
was
a
really
good
beer
he
was
right
the
first
sip
a
little
more
bitter
than
expected
not
a
bad
thing
definitely
nicely
balanced
not
as
sweetly
malty
as
some
bitters
a
fine
example
of
an
english
pub
session
brew
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
into
english
ales
for
sure
a
rather
nice
bitter
the
flavour
doesnt
try
to
overwhelm
you
but
the
balance
is
excellent
the
bitterness
is
well
attenuated
making
this
easy
to
drink
worthy
of
your
time
overall
a
very
nice
bitter
perhaps
not
what
would
be
found
across
the
pond
but
about
as
good
as
it
gets
on
these
shores
tastemouthfeel
delicious
fruity
esters
bready
and
slightly
toasted

up

mild
diacetyl

very
soft

body
faintly
metallic
in
the
finish
with
a
soft
earthy

bite
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
with
this
one
this
is
quiet
tasty
and
easy
drinking
piece
of
cake
very
enjoyable
acquired
a
taste
for
english
bitters
on
a
trip
to
london
this
is
a
nice
beer
good
but
not
great
gold
to
copper
in
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
a
little
of
a
spice
or
hop
aroma
but
not
too
strong
maintains
an
effervessance
in
the
glass
and
mouth
not
to
hoppy
or
too
bitter
not
as
creamy
as
some
of
the
hand
pumped
bitters
overall
good
for
the
style
and
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
just
usually
perfer
a
beer
with
more
aggressive
flavors
overall
for
my
first
english
bitter
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
style
and
i
would
look
very
forward
to
trying
this
in
england
d
drinking
this
beer
is
a
breeze
and
its
very
sessionable
this
is
probably
the
most
authentic
bitter
i
have
ever
had
and
i
am
glad
to
finally
have
the
experience
not
a
life
changing
brew
but
i
know
that
if
i
iever
make
it
to
the
uk
i
will
cherish
the
opportunity
to
drink
beers
like
this
from
the
cask
all
day
long
if
only
they
were
cheaper
fresher
and
more
readliy
available
notes
pretty
good
i
suppose
i
seems
pretty
spoton
for
the
style
though
the
very
active
carbonation
was
a
bit
of
a
distraction
i
personally
feel
rather
indifferent
toward
it
but
bitters
have
never
really
been
a
favorite
style
of
mine
if
you
like
session
ales
you
will
want
to
give
this
one
a
try
nice
session
beer
that
makes
you
want
to
take
large
sips
the
pint
goes
bye
bye
before
you
know
it

this

whole

does

i
am

and
apparently
wasnt
even
from
the
48
hurs
previous
that
it
arrived
a

pours
a

with

of

with
a

of

brings
some
light

as
well
as

brings
hints
of

again
with
a
slight
amount
of

feel
is

without
much
of
any
bitterness
or
sweetness
overall
fairly
plain
with
a
few
off
flavors
nothing
really
major
wrong
with
it
but
it
really
didnt
bring
all
that
much
to
the
table
so
this
is
what
a
good
english
bitter
is
like
is
it
i
like
it
drinkability
is
absolutely
off
the
charts
insane
this
is
so
easy
to
take
down
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
and
will
definitely
be
going
for
this
again
if
i
see
it
incredibly
sessionable
at
4
2
what
we
have
here
is
a
beer
thats
drinkable
and
different
enough
to
where
itll
probably
get
a
dozen
crappy
reviews
im
certainly
not
a
brit
unless
you
count
the
one
brit
ancestor
in
my
family
but
i
think
this
beer
hits
the
spot
as
it
is
aroma
is
ok
a
little
malts
flavor
is
intersting
very
biscuity
with
a
nice
malt
finish
also
a
very
creamy
flavor
which
leads
to
the
really
nice
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
this
also
gives
this
brew
a
great
drinkibilty
however
the
taste
is
just
ok
i
have
had
better
examples
of
the
style

quite
drinkable

sadly

i
wish
i
had

otherwise
this
is
probably
the
best

this

this

its
not

just
loved
the
look

a

but
was
surprised
by
only
sporatic

the
taste

crisp

very
well

a
really
good

at

could

takes
over

it
is
a

more

i
would
love
to
try
this

in

it
was
just
plain

this

doesnt

had
the
pleasure
of

the

carbonation
very
nice
bitter
d
id
love
to
polish
off
a
bunch
of
these
a
pint
at
a
time
on
a
warm
evening
in
my
neighborhood
pub
this
might
be
a
true
english
bitter
but
give
me
a
honkers
over
this
pours
a
pleasing
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
down
the
glass
there
are
some
floaters
of
yeast
fine
by
me
the
smell
is
biscuit
straw
some
mild
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
grain
mineral
again
the
mild
citrus
and
a
finish
thats
bitter
but
mellow
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
very
light
carbonation
with
a
finish
thats
just
slightly
dry
its
immensely
drinkable
and
would
make
a
perfect
session
beer
but
for
the
rather
staggering
price
per
bottle
wish
someone
around
here
would
get
this
for
growler
fills
a
half
liter
bottle
poured
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
hazy
apricot
in
color
with
a
healthy
two
fingers
of
lingering
fluffy
white
head
a
great
looking
pour
smells
of
mild
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
fall
fruits
such
as
pear
and
apple
and
grassy
hops
flavor
carries
on
from
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
bitter
mildly
floral
hops
and
lightly
toasted
bread
awesome
stuff
a
notch
above
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
to
hell
with
the
price
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
this
must
be
heaven
on
cask
had
this
in
500
ml
bottle
at
the
capital
ale
house
in
richmond
downtown
it
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
a
halfinch
of
head
in
a
pint
glass
aromas
pfcaramel
orange
and
some
apple
a
nice
mild
taste
with
caramael
and
some
apple
a
little
citric
bitterness
near
the
end
very
smooth
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
wish
i
could
get
this
beer
in
houston
will
have
again
this
is
a
very
nice
bitter
that
i
would
certainly
like
to
have
again
this
is
one
i
would
love
to
have
on
cask
very
drinkable
bluebird
bitter
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
quickly
thins
out
carbonation
is
subtle
the
smell
at
first
was
not
real
present
perhaps
the
brew
was
too
cold
as
it
warmed
the
maltiness
came
on
doughy
with
a
very
floral
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
mind
blowing
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toast
the
finish
was
dry
and
hoppy
with
floral
and
grassy
tones
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
dry
and
very
smooth
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
one
of
the
best
session
brews
i
have
had
to
date
poured
from
a
bottle
into
imperial
etched
bottom
pint
glass
poured
light
copper
with
little
head
however
it
retained
and
there
was
a
little
lacing
taste
at
first
was
light
almost
seemed
watered
down
after
a
few
more
sips
i
picked
up
light
floral
hops
with
a
stronger
malt
backbone
and
light
bitterness
carbonation
was
light
and
easy
going
with
an
abv
of
4
2
this
is
beyond
drinkable
i
could
pound
these
out
all
night
and
feel
like
a
champ
well
done
and
a
perfect
english
bitter
overall
still
easily
drinkable
i
did
really
like
the
hoppiness
but
i
also
wanted
more
malt
balance
from
this
english
brew
i
poured
from
a
16
9
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
pale
clear
gold
in
color
with
a
2
finger
white
head
the
head
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
a
grassy
smell
but
not
much
gping
on
the
flavor
has
a
pleasent
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
would
be
a
great
session
beer
this
was
not
my
favorite
an
ok
beer
that
would
be
much
better
either
on
tap
or
on
cask
nicely
whipped
up
and
thick
white
foam
of
a
head
no
lack
of
lacing
settles
into
a
one
finger
level
before
finally
dissolving
light
orangeyellow
color
completely
transparent
and
squeaky
clean
in
appearance
lightens
some
at
the
rims
not
many
bubbles
apparent
throughout
crisp
briskly
paced
nose
of
green
oily
hops
pressed
flower
petals
wet
mineral
shards
as
it
warms
you
get
more
malt
softness
to
cushion
any
rougher
edges
finishes
with
ruby
to
pink
grapefruit
sour
and
sweet
notes
mediumbodied
buoyed
by
a
consistent
carbonated
fizz
which
keeps
the
mouth
full
that
said
plenty
of
spring
to
its
step
the
pink
grapefruit
orange
lemon
citrus
never
blows
you
away
but
sticks
around
light
biscuit
and
scone
breadiness
texture
is
dry
overall
but
pliant
not
desiccating
the
grass
and
grain
bits
fit
with
the
lighter
tea
leaf
and
almost
chalkiness
even
after
the
flavors
subside
you
feel
the
gentle
imprint
on
your
palate
its
got
that
old
school
vibe
the
only
thing
prohibitive
about
bluebird
is
the
price
and
availability
otherwise
i
would
drink
this
every
day
clear
copper
with
one
finger
white
head
some
lacings
aroma
is
malty
and
apple
taste
is
sweet
malts
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitters
dry
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
partly
due
to
low
carbonation
superbly
drinkable
with
the
4
2
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
evening
d
exceptionally
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
with
dinner
a
really
nice
beer
this
could
easily
be
a
sesssion
beer
to
drink
all
night
light
in
abv
so
its
drinkable
yet
has
plenty
of
flavor
so
you
want
to
drink
this
one
i
really
like
this
style
and
this
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
definitely
recommend
light
malty
and
delicious
bluebird
bitter
is
to
me
a
very
english
beer
and
im
happy
to
get
a
hold
of
a
bottle
around
here
it
has
a
very
nice
sweet
malt
character
balanced
well
by
some
floralmineral
hops
its
fairly
dry
for
the
caramel
malt
but
then
its
not
a
very
strong
beer
the
lack
of
strength
seems
to
take
something
away
from
the
aroma
but
i
imagine
this
and
all
of
my
ratings
would
rise
if
i
had
it
out
of
a
cask
at
a
pub
near
the
brewery
its
a
great
session
beer
that
actually
lives
up
to
the
spirit
of
a
session
beer
one
could
have
quite
a
few
glasses
of
this
stuff
the
appearance
is
bright
and
amber
with
pretty
good
lacing
the
flavor
is
nicely
bitter
from
the
hops
with
good
balancing
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
creamy
with
gentle
and
fine
hop
bite
its
hard
for
me
to
really
understand
english
bitters
having
never
been
to
an
english
pub
with
fresh
casks
so
my
scores
could
radically
change
once
i
get
more
experience
under
my
belt
as
a
fat
slice
of
meatloaf
is
to
comfort
food
bluebird
bitter
makes
for
a
memorable
glass
of
comfort
beer
mediumbright
yellow
in
color
it
develops
a
tight
head
that
lingers
for
the
ride
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
leaving
lace
everywhere
theres
a
nice
citurusy
hops
hit
in
the
nose
somewhat
mellowed
by
the
malt
the
taste
is
cleanly
divided
by
earthy
malt
in
the
front
decent
fizz
in
the
middle
and
then
a
fruity
orangepeel
hoppy
tang
that
goes
all
the
way
down
the
back
of
your
throat
low
abv
is
an
advantage
too
an
allaround
great
beer
neckandneck
with
harviestouns
bitter
and
twisted
pours
a
pale
amber
brown
with
a
thin
tightly
beaded
head
and
some
nice
lacing
classic
biscuity
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
crisp
minerality
gentle
biscuity
malt
in
the
mouth
with
a
clean
slightly
chalky
finish
fairly
dry
with
some
light
earthy
hops
a
classic
bitter
soothing
and
satisfying
i
feel
inspired
to
search
out
some
cask
ales
i
just
wish
this
beer
was
a
bit
more
affordable
it
would
be
great
for
a
party
ill
definitely
pick
it
up
again
pours
a
applecider
colored
body
that
is
seethru
with
good
carbonation
leading
to
an
almost
threefinger
high
head
that
is
rocky
mild
citric
hop
notes
along
with
herbal
and
floral
tones
tea
like
very
smooth
and
creamy
mild
hop
bitterness
with
a
slightly
dry
backbite
a
lightbodied
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
again
reminds
of
iced
tea
with
lemon
some
sweetness
is
tucked
in
there
too
maybe
caramel
or
honey
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
great
to
relax
with
drinkability
d
definitely
a
sessiondesigned
brew
this
is
easy
going
and
smooth
but
has
enough
gripping
hop
bitterness
to
keep
it
interesting
exactly
what
i
expect
in
an
english
bitter
smooth
wellbalanced
and
leaving
me
wanting
more
pours
a
clear
golden
copper
with
almost
zero
head
smell
is
lightly
malty
and
citrus
taste
is
surprisingly
citrusy
upfront
with
a
nice
clean
malt
middle
and
a
toasty
malty
finish
there
is
also
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
carbonation
levels
low
very
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
i
fear
that
the
trip
overseas
has
decreased
the
quality
of
this
beer
i
suspect
if
i
had
this
at
the
source
on
cask
i
would
be
giving
it
a
near
perfect
rating
still
quite
good
from
the
bottle
overall
consider
my
favorite
beers
tend
to
be
really
hoppy
this
is
a
very
good
very
drinkable
beer
but
probably
one
i
would
only
drink
in
teh
scenario
where
i
have
all
afternoon
or
night
to
hang
out
with
friends
and
didnt
want
to
fill
up
or
booze
out
too
quickly

just

i
must
say
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
english
bitter
it
makes
me
want
to
grab
a
plane
to
england
and
try
every
bitter
i
can

wish
we
had

i
will
be
grabbing
this
again
for
sure
it
definitely
is
a
session

i
must
find
more
bitters
like
this

more
than
a

d
this
is
an
imminently
pleasant
session
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
it
for
that
purpose
pours
a
nice

with
a
great
head
and
great
lacing
along
with
a
bit
of
sediment
floating
around
for
a
few
minutes
excellent

a
very
crisp
beer
with
light
floral
scents
from
both
the
hops
and
malts
an
excellent
taste
a
nice
hopmalt
merging
with
a
great
slightly
hoppy
tang
at
the
end
it
goes
down
extremely
easily
one
of
the
best
bitters
ive
ever
had
an
awesome
brew
here
nothing
out
of
control
but
a
good
kick
in
the
pants
bittering
hop
and
a
refreshing
choice
if
bitter
is
your
thing
it
pours
into
the
glass
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
amber
very
inviting
aroma
is
fairly
malty
and
has
some
good
hops
hints
flavor
is
bitter
but
not
nastily
so
has
both
hoppy
and
malty
components
a
little
thin
but
still
pleasant
and
satisfying
a
good
lunch
beer
easy
to

overpriced
and
kind
of
boring
500ml

color
of
medium
gold
with
a
quickly
dissipating
thick
light
white
colored
head
nose
of
pale
hops
stale
and
sweat

taste
of
pale
hops
ever
so
slight
malts
and
very
mild
body
is
low
viscosity
and
with
high
to
medium
carbonation


sweat
and
light
hops
kinda
honey
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
dry
cracker
aroma
with
a
faint
hint
of
minerals
the
flavor
is
a
mild
blend
of
caramel
and
apples
pinned
to
the
light
dry
malt
backbone
with
its
hint
of
minerals
and
slight
acidity
there
are
better
out
there
overall
a
decent
bittersession
ale
but
its
pretty
subdued
and
not
very
interesting
nothing
to
remember
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
real
british
style
ale
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
with
this
offering
the
pour
is
pretty
frothy
with
a
head
that
lingers
and
has
some
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
bisquit
malt
some
hops
some
floral
notes
in
there
too
the
smell
is
the
low
point
and
it
isnt
that
low
if
you
want
to
characterize
it
as
such
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
dry
british
ale
at
its
core
with
just
enough
hops
and
malts
to
create
a
fine
balance
there
is
an
interesting
dandelion
taste
at
the
back
end
that
i
thought
was
quite
good
and
distinctive
on
the
bottle
they
label
it
as
geranium
gernanium
or
dandelion
either
way
it
is
a
special
bonus
that
is
quite
enjoyable
this
ale
is
a
typical
british
style
ale
and
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
one
or
if
the
style
is
to
your
liking
you
wont
go
wrong
here
the
floral
notes
only
add
to
the
experience
lchaim
this
beer
does
what
it
should
which
is
provide
a
crisp
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
bitterness
nothing
overpowering
which
is
fine
with
me
this
is
the
perfect
session
beer
recommended
light
body
with
low
to
moderate
carbonation
makes
for
a
smooth
and
extremely
quaffable
beer
this
is
what
a
session
beer
is
all
about
too
bad
it
has
such
a
short
shelf
life
and
nonobvious
dating
scheme
d
exceptional
wonderfully
complex
and
light
bodied
this
is
one
fine
beer
though
in
a
bottle
would
really
love
to
catch
this
one
on
cask
very
drinkable
drinkability
definately
better
than
the
lambics
here
on
drinkability
also
this
is
better
than
most
beers
on
drinkability
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
cask
conditioned
aspect
cant
be
ported
over
to
bottles
without
comprimising
the
flavor
i
would
love
to
have
this
by
the
case
smooth
and
delicious
thick
and
creamy
with
good
viscosity
cereal
grain
and
toffee
malt
backed
by
flavors
of
butterscotch
and
caramel
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
mid
palate
and
finish
i
could
honestly
drink
this
beer
on
cask
every
waking
moment
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
an
average
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
faint
a
woody
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
touch
of
grassy
hop
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
toastedcaramel
malt
has
an
almost
lemonygrassy
bitterness
to
it
finishes
with
a
green
apple
tartness
it
has
a
unsweetened
tea
like
characteristics
the
feel
is
rather
smooth

burnt

quality
toward
the
finish
with

to
support
slightly
harsher
than
what
i
was
expecting
but
fairly
wellbalanced
and
more
complex
than
some
bitters
also
very
drinkable
due
to
the
tastiness
and
the
lighter
body
turns
out
to
be
a
great
solid
ale
and
if
it
werent
so
pricey
it
definitely
would
become
a
frequent

this
is
quite
the
session
beer
on
cask
at
dba
poured
a
rich
earthy
brown
with
a
small
head
from
the
cask
some
lacing
present
but
not
much
due
to
the
serving
style
smell
was
of
earthy
malt
with
a
decidedly
english
hop
character
taste
was
very
nice
a
very
rich
and
mild
hoppiness
balanced
against
the
sweet
malt
nothing
particularly
blew
me
away
about
the
taste
but
it
did
what
a
bitter
is
supposed
to
balanced
and
mild
perfect
for
having
a
few
down
at
the
pub
mouthfeel
was
very
rich
as
would
be
expected
from
the

relatively

light
mouthfeel
with

then
again
not

not
sure
if
that

the

either
way

it

be
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
copper
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
falls
slowly
into
a
nice
covering
the
smell
is
very
nice
with
sweet
malt
grassy
hops
and
a
slight
lemon
character
the
taste
follows
suit
with
clean
crisp
flavor
the
is
complex
for
something
of
this
abv
the
hops
are
still
present
with
a
nice
refreshing
bite
and
the
malt
goes
from
mild
to
sweet
and
buttery
mouthfeel
and
drinkablility
is
very
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
i
can
not
say
have
had
many
fresh
bitter
syte
beers
but
i
am
beginning
to
really
appreciate
the
style
the
delicate
flavors
and
craftmanship
are
well
done
in
a
beer
with
this
low
an
abv
while
i
do
love
this
brew
i
cant
very
well
say
it
will
take
the
place
of
youngs
s
l
a
in
my
heart
but
it
will
always
hold
the
place
of
that
girlfriend
you
never
really
had
and
could
never
really
get
deep
huh
easy
to
drink
not
a
masterpiece
but
a
pleasant
brew
drinkability
good
balance
of
malt
citrusy
hops
and
bitterness
but
nothing
that
special
even
as
a
low
abv
session
beer
theres
much
better
choices
out
there
a
very
nice
sessionable
english
ale
easily
drinkable
aromatic
with
a
nice
taste
and
modest
abv
too
bad
that
it
comes
in
pretty
costly
singles
would
get
more
of
for
a
good
session
if
it
were
in
6packs
and
more
affordable
an
innovative
enjoyable
bitter
a
beer
that
has
some
interesting
character
but
not
at
all
what
i
expected
for
the
style
i
cant
say
that
i
reccommend
it
beerwise
the
brew
was
ok
average
on
all
fronts
however
for
a
bitter
i
thought
the
fruity
flavors
were
too
prevelent
for
an
english
pale
the
body
was
too
low
the
beer
seems
to
be
caught
between
a
few
different
styles
and
cause
confusion
estery
fruity
flavors
a
high
and
flavorful
but
the
body
seems
to
give
way
far
too
soon
a
pronounced
bitterness
works
well
for
many
brittish
styles
however
the
balance
is
not
there
for
a
pale
and
the
clean
crisp
feel
is
not
there
for
a
bitter
or
an
esb
the
caramel
bready
flavors
are
nice
but
get
dwarfed
a
bit
by
the
peaches
pear
apple
flavors
the
bottle
conditioning
gives
a
richer
earthier
flavor
and
texture
which
helps
all
in
all
an
ok
beer
with
schitzophrenia
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
and
watery
as
well
though
with
the
low
alcohol
content
it
would
be
pretty
sessionable
but
there
are
many
better
ales
out
there
that
id
prefer
to
have
for
that
purpose
so
i
doubt
ill
be
going
for
this
one
again
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
i
once
had
it
on
tap
and
it
sorta
blew
me
away
great
caramel
maltiness
with
a
crisp
hop
bite
all
the
while
being
an
exceedingly
drinkable
session
brew
the
bottled
version
which
im
reviewing
now
pales
in
comparison
the
tangy
hop
bite
is
still
pretty
perky
but
the
malt
character
isnt
nearly
as
bright
and
the
overall
flavor
is
a
bit
watery
on
top
of
that
the
graininess
is
a
little
flat
in
the
finish
then
again
lightness
in
flavor
and
the
subsequent
drinkability
are
a
trademarks
of
this
style
and
the
finish
features
a
nice
bit
of
that
tasty
hop
spice
still
i
was
really
excited
to
find
this
one
in
a
bottle
having
tried
it
ontap
but
sadly
a
bit
disappointing
comparatively
however
its
not
bad

something

not

the
beer
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
bit
of
white
lace
the
aroma
was
of
bitter
hops
the
taste
was
very
soft
malt
flavor
that
moved
quickly
to
hops
then
finished
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
the
feel
was
medium
and
oily
a
good
beer
with
lots
of
delicate
flavors
and
textures
probably
a
good

could
go
well
with

would
overpower
this
beer
filled
up
an
imperial

nicely
with
a
light

short
loose

smell
was
mild
and
hard
to

at
time
but
nice
tasted
of
lightly
carmelized
malts
with
subtle

something
happened
during
the
course
of
my
drink
and
the
taste
soured

the

is
that
at

it
was
one
of
the
best

ive
tried
a

i
will
say
it
was

i
got
this
one
as

gift
from
wl0307
while

london
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beverage
although
a
little
pricey
here
in

i
would
avoid
this
in

an

a

but
i

ive
had
a
fresher
bottle
before
i
may
revisit
notes
i
liked
it
and
my
next
comment
was
not
considered
in
the
review
as
the
beer
was
good
but
damn
for
such
a
smallish
brew
this
is
mad
money
even
by
import
standards
pours
very
clear
golden
light
brown
small
creamy
head
with
good

aroma
is
lightly
toasted
caramel
malts
over
leafy

and
hard

poor
fizzy
metallic
water
that
leads
directly
to
a
bitter
hop
finish
no
malt
flavor
thin
watery
strongly
carbonated
body
will
definitely
not
be
buying
this
again
looking
at
others
comments
huh
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
the
beer
is
an
amber
color
with
about
a
12
inch
white
head
which
disappears
pretty
quickly
bluebird
bitter
has
a
nice
aroma
its
pretty
citrusy
orangegrapefruit
and
hoppy
it
has
a
mild
citrusy
hops
taste
and
also
a
slight
breadyeast
taste
with
a
low
to
medium
bitter
aftertaste
nothing
overpowering
there
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
watery
with
not
too
much
carbonation
at
all
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
very
crisp
i
think
it
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
because
of
the
low
alcohol
content
and
that
it
has
some
taste
too
for
the
style
its
a
pretty
good
beer
d
if
the
diacetyl
taste
would
go
away
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
i
am
going
to
finish
it
all
but
i
do
think
it
was
a
decent
beer
all
in
all
and
come
the
hot
days
of
summer
might
find
me
buying
a
few
more
of
these
very
good
drinkability
due
to
good
flvor
and
smell
and
possibly
in
part
to
a
little
bit
of
a
lighter
body
id
have
no
prolem
putting
away
more
than
a
few
pints
of
this
pours
with
a
substantial
head
that
fades
but
leaves
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
heavy
on
apple
and
various
citrus
fruits
with
a
touch
of
doughiness
underneath
the
first
taste
is
of
acidic
fruits
and
bitter
hops
with
a
layering
of
slight
pale
malts
filtering
in
afterward
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
thin
but
not
really
watery
the
emphasis
here
is
on
drinkablility
the
smooth
mouthfeel
pleasantandnotoverwhleming
flavors
and
well
integrated
hops
make
for
a
brew
that
is
both
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
the
closest
on
bottle
to
a
cask
conditioned
ale
that
i
have
had
yet
pours
with
little
or
no
head
very
little
carbonation
and
aroma
suprisingly
hoppy
yet
not
overpowering
very
refreshing
and
well
balanced
if
i
wanted
to
introduce
someone
to
a
cask
conditioned
beer
to
someone
who
hasnt
been
to
the
uk
or
hasnt
had
a
cask
here
i
would
serve
them
this
i
wish
it
came
in
at
least
a
four
pack
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
certainlly
not
a
big
beer
but
a
tasty
one
and
its
low
alcohol
lends
well
to
it
being
a
great
session
choice
if
one
could
afford
it
at
the
price
bluebird
bitter
pours
a
nice
copper
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
from
a
50cl
brown
bottle
really
nice
aroma
hops
and
citrus
are
noticeable
much
lighter
mouthfeel
than
i
was
expecting
no
real
off
tastes
although
the
bottle
describes
the
taste
as
resinous
hops
which
i
would
agree
with
it
really
isnt
all
that
hoppy
its
really
quite
a
light
beer
frankly
its
just
not
very
flavorful
i
cant
say
that
i
could
recommend
this
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
mouthfeeldrinkability
active
and
very
responsive
in
the
mouth
relatively
smooth
going
down
unfortunately
the
negative
impressions
of
smell
and
taste
outweigh
the
positive
and
this
beer
finds
its
place
next
to
the
curb
on
memory
lane
i
had
a
nice
bitter
at
cbc
this
weekend
and
was
reminded
how
great
the
style
is
so
i
went
out
and
bought
a
few
authentic
english
style
bitters
ive
had
this
before
but
it
was
quite
a
while
ago
at
the
moan
and
dove
which
i
sadly
cant
go
to
as
frequently
as
before
pours
a
crystal
clear
apple
juice
amber
color
with
plenty
of
quickly
rising
bubbles
very
active
and
carbonated
apparantly
and
a
decent
but
fast
fading
head
once
again
really
a
super
clear
beer
here
smells
sharp
nice
hop
presence
here
spicy
english
style
all
the
way
here
although
more
pronounced
than
usual
im
definitely
picking
up
on
some
sweet
root
beer
scents
as
well
which
is
interesting
soft
fruity
esters
all
over
the
place
and
a
nice
carmel
malt
backdrop
mmm
so
tasty
as
much
as
i
love
ballsy
overly
hoppy
american
ipas
and
what
not
theres
nothing
that
beats
a
well
made
perfectly
subtle
beer
and
thats
what
this
is
in
my
opinion
the
complexity
is
easy
to
overlook
here
the
spicy
herbal
hops
the
toffee
like
maltiness
and
the
fruityness
come
together
perfectly
the
spicy
and
floral
english
challanger
i
read
the
label
hops
are
frickin
awesome
the
appley
almost
grapey
juicy
fruityness
gives
the
beer
so
much
character
and
the
classic
english
maltiness
anchors
the
beer
perfectly
wow
what
a
piece
of
work
here
lively
floaty
mouthfeel
without
being
watery
though
a
little
less
carbonation
might
benefit
super
session
beer
at
4
point
something
abv
i
wish
more
us
brewers
could
pull
this
off
i
know
everyones
got
their
own
tastes
but
if
you
dont
like
this
beer
youve
got
ants
in
your
pants
dig
into
the
subtleties
had
this
at
a
beer
and
cheese
tasting
it
was
paired
with
sharpham
rustice
devon
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
head
or
lacing
aroma
is
good
with
a
good
bit
of
citrus
hops
this
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
tasted
better
as
it
warmed
up
the
mouthfeel
is
not
thin
and
it
feels
like
there
is
some
character
to
this
highly
drinkable
ale
so
simple
and
so
small
yet
very
hoppy
and
flavorful
this
beer
is
such
a
contradiction
in
tastes
sort
of
the
pilsner
of
english
bitters
im
surprised
this
isnt
labeled
as
a
mild
just
a
great
simple
tasty
session
beer
drinkability
very
high
low
alcohol
content
packed
with
enough
flavor
and
a
light
body
make
this
a
pretty
good
session
beer
its
price
however
takes
something
away
from
that
an
interesting
bitter
almost
hefe
or
saisonlike
in
character
with
its
fruity
aromas
and
flavors
according
to
the
label
this
is
due
to
higher
fermentation
temps
not
exactly
your
standard
bitter
but
quite
good
dont
get
discouraged
by
the
citrus
tastes
it
does
finish
with
a
nice
hop
taste
though
not
a
big
bold
assault
like
you
get
with
some
american
craft
brews
these
days
very
nicely
balanced
and
an
excellent
tasty
example
of
the
bitter
style
of
british
ales
highly
recommended
man
did
i
like
this
beer
i
liked
it
so
much
i
picked
up
another
few
bottles
before
reviewing
this
baby
pours
out
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamish
color
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
it
actually
does
have
a
tasty
citrus
kind
of
smell
too
i
have
to
say
this
baby
has
an
awesome
tart
flavour
that
is
followed
up
by
a
pleasant
bittery
followthrough
this
is
one
i
would
love
to
sit
around
drinking
all
day
watching
sports
on
tv
if
it
werent
like
3
00
a
bottle
thats
the
only
thing
for
me
that
prevents
this
from
being
a
regular
session
beer
overall
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
wonderful
balance
and
so
very
refreshing
could
enjoy
this
one
all
day
if
i
was
rich
and
didnt
worry
about
money
then
i
would
buy
a
bunch
of
these
and
have
them
as
a
great
session
beer
but
it
is
a
touch
bland
which
i
think
would
help
for
session
beers
but
not
if
your
looking
for
a
totally
just
one
beer
with
loads
of
flavor
beer
pours
a
solid
golden
color
with
a
light
coating
of
foamy
head
and
sparse
bubbles
popping
off
the
bottom
to
maintain
things
nose
is
very
nice
i
get
notes
of
crisp
british
hop
not
earthy
but
almost
resinous
and
green
malty
character
is
nice
and
toasty
but
hops
dominate
this
one
i
am
intrigued
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
toasy
british
malt
dominates
with
a
very
fresh
and
green
hop
playing
in
there
as
well
bitterness
is
mild
and
just
enough
to
play
well
with
the
malt
backbone
i
think
this
is
a
well
built
beer
feel
is
moderate
with
a
very
light
to
light
moderate
carbonation
just
enough
to
let
me
know
it
is
there
easily
a
session
brew
full
flavor
with
nothing
to
detract
from
the
drinkability
in
the
form
of
alcohol
or
off
flavors
this
is
another
british
brew
ive
had
that
is
drawing
me
closer
to
the
subtle
styles
i
like
the
good
flavor
and
lighter
alcohol
pours
a
copper
color
with
lots
of
bits
of
yeast
floating
around
this
brew
has
yeasty
aroma
with
plenty
of
biscuit
maltiness
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
nice
and
mild
the
hops
are
present
but
not
overpowering
in
fact
they
balance
well
with
the
slightly
sweet
malts
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
and
a
great
example
of
an
english
bitter
gotta
say
that
i
love
this
brew
drinkability
very
excellent
the
nice
bittermalty
beginning
to
the
sip
combined
with
the
nice
clean
finish
could
keep
me
drinking
this
all
night
poured
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
and
lightly
carbonated
smell
was
moderately
hoppy
with
a
spiciness
to
it
taste
was
classic
english
bitter
beer
style
with
the
hops
coming
through
but
not
overpowering
thought
it
was
a
bit
weak
on
the
palate
but
that
may
be
due
mostly
to
the
style
highly
drinkable
and
reminded
me
of
other
beers
in
this
style
that
ive
had
in
the
uk
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
at
you
4

easy

approx

light
finish
good
bitter
a
good
beer
allaround
its
crisp
and
the
bitterness
makes
your
mouth
a
little
cottony
but
it
has
a
pretty
good
flavor
i
couldnt
drink
a
bitter
like
this
all
the
time
but
its
interesting
once
in
a
while
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
beautiful
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
smell
spicy
and
fruity
faintly
citrusy
and
enticing
the
taste
seems
biscuity
buttery
and
faintly
hoppy
with
notes
of
citrus
and
spice
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
too
thin
seems
about
right
for
a
bitter
drinkability
id
be
happy
to
drink
more
and
suspect
that
if
this
was
more
widely
available
id
be
drinking
it
often
good
beer
d
compared
with
my
previous
note
of
this
beer
about
four
months
ago
i
cant
believe
how
similar
impressions
ive
got
from
the
flavour
yet
its
quite
different
on
the
nose
my
knowledge
is
too
limited
to
explain
this
fact
but
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
im
certain
that
its
one
of
my
alltime
favourite
sessions
bitters
definitely
a
drinkable
session
beer
but
nothing
special
like
i
said
earlier
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
only
it
were
slightly
more
affordable
the
taste
is
also
fruity
with
maybe
a
lemony
note
in
the
background
but
up
front
its
about
the
malt
a
very
drinkable
english
bitter
its
one
of
my
favourites
of
the
style
on
tap
at
the
muddy
pig
this
style
of
beerenglish
bitter
was
served
way
too
cold
so
i
drank
something
else
while
waiting
for
it
to
warm
up
it
is
a
nice
pale
amber
in
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
doesnt
last
there
is
no
lacing
on
the
glass
there
is
no
discernable
odor
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
up
i
could
smell
a
light
maltiness
the
taste
is
fruity
with
elements
of
peach
apricot
and
toasted
malt
there
is
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
at
the
finish
but
it
doesnt
last
this
is
a
balanced
nice
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
it
goes
down
easily
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
would
be
tremendous
if
served
on
cask
as
it
is
its
good
just
not
extraordinary
at
4
2abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
all
night
great
to
see
a
low
alcohol
but
very
flavorful
beer
out
there
too
bad
the
price
tag
is
steep
for
a
4
2
beer
if
nothing
else
it
is
drinkable
but
if
a
beer
like
this
fails
to
be
drinkable
then
somebody
really
screwedup
overall
this
is
a
perfectly
fine
beer
i
mean
it
is
decent
but
like
i
said
before
i
dont
expect
to
visit
this
beer
often
my
bottle
was
purchased
in
omaha
bluebird
bitter
has
a
nice
golden
color
and
not
much
head
at
least
not
when
i
poured
it
from
a
bottle
it
smells
like
that
cheap
sweat
soft
and
sticky
candy
shaped
like
fruits
there
is
a
pronounced
hop
taste
but
not
much
else
what
surprised
me
and
in
contradiction
with
my
high
expectations
was
a
lack
of
body
but
its
still
a
decent
bitter
bluedird
pours
golden
with
very
little
head
i
detect
sugary
sweet
baked
goods
with
a
grassy
hop
aroma
nothing
but
hop
flavor
again
grassy
and
floral
are
the
prominent
flavors
finished
quite
dry
but
lingered
a
touch
overall
not
a
bad
pint
at
all
yeast
and
lots
of
it
crystal
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
faded
quickly
leaves
a
coat
of
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
that
you
can
swirl
into
the
beer
if
you
think
of
it
ahead
of
time
a
bit
of
citrus
on
the
nose
but
rather
subdued
a
sharp
hoppiness
to
it
some
earthy
almost
peaty
tones
a
tad
of
an
aftertaste
that
was
kinda
soapy
and
unpleasant
felt
rather
chewey
for
a
thinner
style
and
it
was
welcomed
pair
with
chicken
or
barbecued
leg
of
lamb
encrusted
with
english
whole
grain
mustard
pepper
and
sage
for
a
beer
with
so
much
diacetyl
kept
in
check
by
hops
even
as
it
warms
this
was
exceptionall
drinkable
makes
me
want
to
try
their
bluebird
xb
with
the
mt
hood
hops
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
modest
but
lasting
head
lots
of
yeast
floating
around
chunkstyle
in
the
bottle
which
i
must
say
was
a
bit
offputting
very
herbal
hop
aroma
that
suggested
some
intensity
but
the
flavor
was
actually
quite
mild
soft
herbal
hop
bitterness
backed
by
a
nice
toasty
maltiness
smooth
and
buttery
dry
and
extremely
drinkable
if
you
want
an
old
school
english
ale
this
is
the
one
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
too
if
it
wasnt
so
damned
expensive
3
99
bottle
very
drinkable
brew
mild
yet
interesting
and
pleasant
drinkability
and
notes

one
of
the
better
bitters
that
i
have
had
and
a
great
session
beer
it
may
be
a
bit
expensive
to
actually
be
a
regular
session
beer
but
that
it
is
certainly
easy
to
drink
the
poor
head
retention
is
probably
my
biggest
complaint
but
the
flavor
and
smell
are
great
orange
yellow
malty
nose
with
very
little
in
the
hop
department
malt
flavor
dominates
with
molasses
and
some
residual
hop
bitterness
some
light
fruit
notes
perhaps
apple
or
peach
virtually
no
aftertaste
super
drinkable
and
perhaps
the
ultimate
session
beer
as
it
has
been
declared
in
the
uk
if
there
is
one
problem
its
a
slight
lack
of
flavor
otherwise
a
decent
pour
and
a
lunchtime
staple
my
first
true
english
bitter
bluebirds
color
is
a
hazy
copper
with
a
creamy
averagesized
head
retention
consists
of
a
nice
short
layer
of
cream
aroma
is
mainly
of
malts
similar
to
caramel
aroma
but
with
their
own
distinct
smell
a
light
dose
of
english
hop
is
also
noted
the
taste
is
maltier
than
expected
but
there
are
still
enough
hops
to
go
around
hop
taste
is
very
different
from
the
american
styles
that
i
am
used
to
bitterness
is
there
but
not
extreme
my
first
brush
with
an
english
bitter
leaves
me
with
respect
for
bluebird
but
also
the
realization
that
this
isnt
probably
going
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
3
99
to
me
poured
into
a
pint
tumbler
a
clear
light
brown
color
with
golden
highlights
a
white
head
forms
then
falls
quickly
but
rising
carbonation
and
groups
of
suds
continue
swirling
around
the
surface
of
the
ale
smells
of
orangey
hops
a
little
bit
floral
with
malt
way
in
the
background
the
taste
again
is
hops
first
then
a
medium
maltiness
light
bodied
with
pretty
strong
carbonation
it
doesnt
stand
up
against
a
cold
and
rainy
night
like
this
one
but
it
will
make
a
smart
session
brew
going
into
the
summer
heat
just
a
great
mouthfeel
soft
with
low
carbonation
it
is
also
slightly
oily
and
the
hops
coat
your
mouth
almost
a
perfect
example
of
a
session
beer
moderate
alcohol
levels
combined
with
a
tasty
complex
and
interesting
beer
well
done
and
well
worth
the
2
49
at
sams
liquors
in
downers
grove
very
smooth
and
drinkable
excellent
for
a
session
very
easy
session
brew
and
a
welcome
break
from
the
extreme
powerhopped
ales
i
usually
choose
to
drink
thanks
to
joshua
ablett
for
the
sample
the
smell
has
an
herbal
hoppy
start
followed
by
subtle
yeast
and
malt
aromas
likewise
the
taste
is
at
first
gently
bitter
hops
then
buttery
malt
clean
and
fruity
the
plentiful
piney
hops
comes
full
circle
and
finishes
the
bottle
conditioning
lends
a
slight
earthy
yeasty
note
to
the
aftertaste
very
smooth
nothing
assertive
but
its
well
balanced
and
refreshing
had
this
on
cask
last
evening
it
was
pulled
to
a
golden
color
with
the
top
half
having
a
creamy
look
that
broke
to
a
fairly
nice
white
head
after
a
few
minutes
the
entire
brew
had
that
golden
color
while
the
head
continued
to
break
down
quite
rapidly
the
aromas
from
this
brew
are
malt
with
a
floral
hop
note
not
as
pronounced
as
when
i
just
had
it
on
tap
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
sweet
malt
like
taste
leads
and
breaks
to
a
bitterness
from
the
hops
that
does
not
last
long
but
is
noticeable
over
all
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
but
think
i
liked
the
on
tap
version
a
bit
more
drinkablity
yes
great
from
the
bottle
even
better
on
cask
though
the
aromas
are
intense
with
pine
mint
lemon
peel
and
roasted
nutshell
resins
the
malt
profile
is
honeylike
on
the
nose
clear
and
purposeful
the
color
is
burnt
gold
the
texture
is
distinctly
lighterbodied
with
sappy
iron
and
slate
resins
defining
the
cadence
and
cascade
of
honey
flavor
this
is
a
hoppy
ale
that
can
be
consumed
carelessly
from
a
picnic
basket
nothing
heavy
or
weird
just
flowery
yellow
buds
and
clean
pulpy
yellow
fruits
the
finish
is
as
dry
as
gin
you
should
also
check
out
old
man
which
is
darker
and
heavier
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
when
looking
for
something
easy
drinking
simple
and
enjoyable
not
a
complex
full
beer
that
makes
yoou
want
to
think
about
it
and
analyze
it
but
thats
ok
sometimes
this
is
exactly
what
you
want
drinkability
just
rolls
right
down
somewhat
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
hint
of
rust
as
well
head
is
rather
compact
and
offwhite
what
it
lacks
in
volume
it
makes
up
for
in
a
persistent
cling
pleasantly
sweet
malt
smell
with
a
slight
bite
of
crisp
hops
predictably
sweet
and
malty
up
front
but
those
flavors
are
quickly
displaced
by
a
lasting
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
oily
but
does
little
to
take
away
from
what
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
was
fortunate
to
have
a
caskconditioned
pint
or
two
of
this
award
winning
brew
at
the
flying
pig
in
malvern
pa
it
poured
a
burnt
orange
color
with
an
almondcolored
head
it
was
remarkablly
clear
with
abundant
lacing
throughout
the
tasting
experience
there
was
a
faint
fragrance
of
floral
hops
some
acidic
fruitiness
and
great
malt
scents
this
bitter
had
the
most
delicate
and
delicious
taste
of
floral
hops
with
a
mellow
malt
backbone
there
also
was
the
presence
of
spicy
hops
and
soft
but
subtle
roasty
malt
sweetness
as
well
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
incredible
an
exceptional
example
of
a
caskconditioned
bitter
other
comments
a
quite
americantasting
bitter
i
cant
pinpoint
exactly
what
makes
it
american
though
the
challenger
hops
probably
take
a
lot
of
the
credit
but
it
just
reminds
me
of
the
typical
pale
ale
you
might
find
at
a
nw
brewpub
or
something
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
poured
to
a
very
lovely
caramelly
golden
color
with
a
nice
and
thick
eggshell
colored
headfull
of
creamy
frothiness
and
some
big
bubbles
nice
head
retention
there
too
nicely
scented
but
i
was
not
sure
what
i
was
catching
there
till
i
read
the
label
and
it
mentioned
that
the
malts
have
a
hint
of
scented
geranium
that
is
it
verrrry
cool
the
feel
is
nice
in
this
one
carbination
is
not
very
pronounced
but
still
there
good
body
to
it
not
heavy
but
not
too
thin
at
all
very
nicely
drinkable
when
i
first
saw
the
name
i
thought
that
this
may
be
a
blueberry
flavored
brew
but
nope
tthis
is
just
a
nicely
hopped
brew
there
is
a
good
peppery
grapefrut
rind
flavor
going
on
very
easy
drinker
taste
is
softly
bitter
with
a
delicate
and
smooth
malt
balance
very
tasty
and
excellent
for
style
a
truly
classic
english
bitter
that
is
very
well
constructed
i
think
this
was
what
the
hobbits
were
drinking
on
cask
in
lord
of
the
rings
on
draft
at
copperfields
in
nyc
this
one
poured
light
amber
with
a
mild
hoppy
nose
low
carbonation
bubbles
slowly
rising
to
the
top
slim
white
head
leaving
light
lacing
well
balanced
light
and
very
drinkable
bitter
in
the
fine
english
tradition
fine
sessioner
what
a
pity
i
only
have
one
bottle
of
this
this
brew
is
a
very
hazy
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
topping
it
off
pleasant
citrus
hop
scent
some
sweet
candy
malt
as
well
the
taste
is
all
english
bitter
subdued
caramel
malt
and
bitter
hop
excellent
nice
tasting
light
english
brew
pretty
wet
finish
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
want
when
youre
planing
on
putting
a
few
down
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
some
copper
highlights
fluffy
and
soapy
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
as
the
pint
goes
down
resinous
flowery
hop
aroma
overrides
a
more
subtle
caramelly
malt
tone
light
fruitiness
too
hop
bitterness
immediately
hits
the
tongue
followed
by
minerally
wateriness
and
tied
together
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
and
grapefruitlike
dryness
in
the
finish
wickedly
drinkable
the
best
bitter
from
across
the
pond
ive
had
to
date
this
beer
has
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
the
head
was
small
did
not
last
but
came
right
back
with
a
quick
swirl
there
was
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
was
mainly
of
malts
with
a
little
hops
in
the
backround
it
has
a
malt
flavor
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
that
is
somewhat
bitter
this
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
would
make
a
good
session
brew
cheers
you
takes
your
chances
when
you
buy
a
beer
in
a
clear
bottle
imported
from
england
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
luckily
in
this
case
there
was
no
real
cause
for
worry
the
beer
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
compact
white
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
lightly
floral
and
musty

all
i
can
say
is
yum
the
bitterness
and
hop
spiciness
combines
with
a
decent
malt
body
to
make
this
a
nice
session
brew
this
very
pretty
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
color
the
head
is
thin
but
looks
creamy
doesnt
leave
much
of
a
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
beer
hits
the
bottom
of
the
glass
your
nose
is
assaultedf
by
a
wonderful
florally
hop
aroma
the
taste
begins
as
slightly
bitter
but
before
it
can
really
bite
your
tastebuds
a
nice
contrasting
malt
background
slides
in
to
soften
the
taste
there
are
definite
floral
notes
in
the
background
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
yet
the
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
the
aroma
seems
to
promise
the
moutfeel
is
very
creamy
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
if
you
were
to
line
up
a
bunch
of
cask
beers
and
a
bunch
of
bottled
beers
i
would
probably
peg
this
as
one
of
the
casks
the
mouthfeel
is
very
reminiscent
of
cask
drinkability
is
extrememly
high
as
it
goes
down
very
well
a
great
session
ale
i
expected
more
got
less
but
not
disappointed
this
bottle
conditioned
beer
pours
a
golden
colour
into
the
glas
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
head
the
taste
is
nice
and
mellow
with
some
nice
bitter
aftertaste
it
also
tastes
alot
of
hops
and
it
has
also
a
little
metallic
taste
but
it
disappears
after
the
first
sip
the
smell
is
balanced
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
this
is
a
beer
i
like
would
like
to
taste
it
on
tap
one
day
wyll
yummy
nothing
like
a
pint
of
bitter
poured
out
a
dirty
light
copper
color
with
a
decent
enough
head
on
it
best
before
121303
uh
oh
but
not
to
worry
it
did
make
it
just
fine
smell
consisted
of
a
good
dose
of
malts
in
there
but
it
was
mixed
in
with
some
hops
and
some
tropical
fruits
taste
was
typical
of
a
bitter
matls
hit
the
palate
first
then
give
away
to
some
hops
that
seem
to
have
a
big
bite
to
them
quite
nice
body
was
nice
and
creamy
too
decent
enough
bitter
seek
it
out
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
superfoamy
white
head
that
takes
a
while
to
subside
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
complex
mix
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
hops
and
fruity
yeast
scent
the
taste
is
fine
it
is
a
mildly
malty
brew
with
a
lot
of
bitter
hop
flavor
this
taste
doesnt
settle
that
well
with
me
it
finishes
dry
and
with
a
stale
hop
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
stinks
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
despite
the
overflowing
head
go
figure
this
beer
is
overrated
the
side
says
its
an
award
winner
the
field
must
have
consisted
of
small
and
obscure
breweries
a
very
light
beer
it
pours
a
golden
amber
with
surprisingly
little
head
and
consequently
no
lace
the
smell
bears
traces
of
florals
and
a
small
hint
of
chocolate
or
something
maybe
from
a
stout
or
porter
and
i
want
to
say
i
smell
a
hint
of
blueberry
too
the
taste
is
a
bit
lackluster
although
it
is
pleasant
certainly
there
is
really
no
hop
presence
here
and
the
malts
do
not
show
through
that
much
theres
just
a
kind
of
bitter
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
although
carbonated
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
its
a
hard
beer
to
describe
i
could
see
drinking
this
beer
on
a
warm
summer
eve
since
its
so
light
ontap
at
half
time
this
golden
amber
brew
poured
crystal
clear
with
virtually
no
head
suggesting
little
if
any
effervescence
the
aroma
was
muted
just
a
little
hops
and
the
taste
was
not
all
that
distinct
furthermore
this
bluebird
was
not
even
very
bitter
frankly
the
ultrathin
mouthfeel
only
served
to
make
the
ale
seem
like
little
more
than
hopflavored
water
a
step
up
from
the
american
macroswill
certainly
but
not
much

write

start
is
somewhat
sweet
nice

and
the
top
moderate
in
its

finish
has
a
friendly
acidity
the
hops
delectable
in
their
spiciness
bonedry
aftertaste
that
languishes
on
the
palate
quite
quaffable
and
a
great
beer
after
a
trying
day
at
work
one
of
the
best
ordinary
bitters
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sitting
down
with
extraordinarily
refreshing
with
a
sharp
hoppy
crispness
and
just
enough
malt
to
keep
things
moving
light
bodied
great
after
a
hard
days
work
i
had
to
order
another
because
16oz
just
isnt
enough
the
taste
is
terrific
a
very
light
bodied
but
very
tasty
english
mild
ale
wonderfully
well
balanced
nice
rich
malts
balanced
with
a
very
flavorful

taste
the
bottle
says
that
they
use
only
challenger
hops
and
ill
have
to
take
their
word
for
it
nice
taste
light
bodied
session
beer
excellent
i
had
three
of
these
in
a
row
at
redbones
so
i
do
think
its
pretty
drinkable
anyway
light
amber
when
poured
no
head
i
thought
it
had
a
subdued
light
grainy
aroma
taste
is
well
rounded
slightly
malty
slightly
hoppy
its
crisp
finish
was
nice
good
session
beer
definitely
bluebird
bitter
is
supremely
drinkable
due
to
its
rather
restrained
flavor
low
abv
and
lightmedium
body
i
also
imagine
that
it
would
go
very
well
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
solid
drinkable
english
bitter
overall
not
a
bad
little
beer
i
wouldnt
pass
this
one
up
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
which
is
strange
for
a
bitter
medium
bodied
and
very
light
carbonation
this
could
be
a
session
beer
if
you
can
get
by
the
mouthfeel
interesting
but
not
overtly
hoppy
a
pale
amberlight
honey
color
with
a
low
finebubbled
white
head
aroma
is
very
light
but
sort
of
fresh
and
flowery
flavor
is
just
as
the
name
says
but
not
a
hoppy
bitter
and
not
like
a
typical
english
style
bitter
its
more
like
a
tingly
tart
and
nearly
sour
bitter
that
grabs
at
your
tongue
and
makes
you
take
notice
the
flavor
is
not
very
complex
and
there
is
no
hop
or
malt
profile
to
speak
of
interesting
to
sip
but
not
to
have
more
than
one
this
bottle
conditioned
bitter
pours
a
nice
amberdull
copper
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
rim
the
aroma
is
an
equal
balance
of
fruity
citrusy
hops
and
malt
the
lightly
sweet
biscuity
malt
melds
with
fruit
flavors
and
a
tealike
bitterness
a
mild
taste
of
limes
can
be
detected
in
the
background
this
mild
bitter
provides
a
nice
easy
contrast
from
the
big
winter
brews
ive
been
enjoying
lately
this
brew
will
always
be
welcome
in
my
fridge
this
bitter
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
thin
white
foam
the
smell
was
mildly
malty
with
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
the
taste
was
hoppy
with
some
citrus
and
pine
elements
the
malt
had
a
hint
of
caramel
flavor
and
there
was
a
touch
of
oak
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
dry
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
was
a
decent
bitter
though
with
hints
of
oxidation
in
the
flavor
tasty
this
would
be
a
honey
on
cask
hoppy
aroma
a
bit
aromatic
english
hops
for
sure
sticky
bready
hoppy
but
thin
ok
finish
hoppy
the
nice
hops
that
were
in
the
nose
didnt
really
eventuate
on
the
palate
perhaps
this
might
benefite
from
some
cask
conditioning
rather
than
in
the
bottle
ill
have
to
wait
to
find
out
i
guess
until
i
get
the
opportunity
to
try
it
on
cask
drinkability

this
one
was
kind
of
watery
for
my
tastes
and
didnt
deliver
on
the
style
it
would
probably
make
a
good
session
beer
though
and
probably
does
better
on
tap
which
is
how
wolfy
tasted
it
mouthfeel
was
watery
in
a
great
way
for
it
really
balanced
the
bitterness
and
called
me
back
for
more
makes
it
highly
drinkable
which
is
the
point
of
a
good
bitter
went
perfectly
with
bleu
cheese
wont
say
no
if
its
on
tap
which
is
better
than
the
bottle
version
i
fear
that
i
just
dont
know
how
to
really
enjoy
and
rate
the
english
bitters
to
me
this
brew
is
just
too
mild
and
creamy
as
to
rate
high
taste
marks
as
i
see
from
others
though
clearly
a
very
refined
beer
with
great
appearance
the
flavor
seems
too
subdued
and
lacquery
to
be
great
am
i
missing
something
here
is
the
subtlety
the
charm
of
this
beer
perhaps
but
i
like
my
beer
to
make
itself
known
to
me
in
its
robust
and
full
flavor
not
in
its
creamy
understated
sophistication
a
refreshing
tasty
mild
and
subtle
ale
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
viking
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
a
modest
white
head
aromas
of
bready
malt
and
floral
hops
dominate
tasted
of
fresh
bread
and
honeyish
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
caramel
lingering
in
the
background
none
of
these
taste
sensations
is
the
least
bit
overwhelming
this
is
a
beer
you
can
consume
repeatedly
with
its
modest
amount
of
alcohol
and
easy
drinkability
had
never
heard
of
this
before
and
was
quite
pleased
by
it
id
have
no
problem
drinking
this
one
all
night
long
it
is
super
clean
and
goes
down
like
silk
it
pours
a
light
tawny
the
aromas
are
of
fresh
baked
shortbread
and
malt
with
a
pleasant
outlying
hoppiness
the
flavors
are
more
of
the
same
hops
dancing
lightly
on
the
tongue
some
malted
milk
flavors
gentle
like
a
bluebird
hop
bitter
and
that
familiar
bisquitshortbread
thing
adding
character
this
is
a
tasty
summer
choice
yet
pricey

i
will
buy
it
again
though
no
question
the
above
applies
to
a
fresh
keg
as
the
keg
gets
older
a
metallic
tinge
creeps
in
which
affects
the
drinkability
im
lucky
enough
to
live
where
two
pubs
man
of
kent
mahars
have
this
on
tap
regularly
i
really
enjoy
the
way
this
ale
takes
me
through
a
complex
ride
of
aroma
and
tastes
from
start
to
finish
but
giving
me
the
nice
nutty
malt
flavor
to
tie
it
all
together
and
its
only
getting
better
as
it
warms
to
its
proper
temperature

fine

worth

be
saving
my
pennies
up
for
another
one
it
pours
with
a

dark

with
a
slight
musky
color
i
smell
some
floral
aromas
but
it
tastes
a
bit

pleasant

had
a
good

that
lasted

could
not

consistent
and
right
where
i
like
it
for
this
style
the
beer
was
light
in
color
with
a
great
beer
aroma
beers
of
this
type
can
come
off
poorly
in
the
bottle
this
was
not
the
case
with
this
product
all
in
all
a
very
clean
tasting
and
enjoyable
bitter
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
to
sit
and
have
some
pub
grub
with
a
few
of
these
is
a
pleasure
the
sharp
crisp
taste
of
pale
malts
and
english
hops
goes
well
with
food
on
draft
it
poured
a
pale
clear
gold
with
a
dense
white
head
that
held
well
restrained
fruit
with
some
biscuit
and
grain
gave
the
impression
of
a
lager
due
to
its
clean
balanced
flavor
ive
gotten
away
from
session
beers
at
times
because
with
other
possibilities
on
tap
they
sometimes
seem
boring
but
this
one
went
down
quite
nicely
very
tasty
could
become
a
new
session
favorite
with
the
low
alcohol
content
nice
wet
cream
head
over
nice
copper
body
very
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
feels
and
looks
almost
like
it
was
cask
but
i
do
not
think
it
was
nice
clean
crisp
english
hops
with
some
light
apple
flavor
beautiful
gold
with
a
hint
of
red
in
color
and
the
head
shrank
to
a
good
14
rocky
base
it
had
a
lively
fruity
hop
aroma
and
medium
carbonation
slight
phenolic
edginess
the
best
part
of
this
beer
though
was
the
taste
it
was
malty
up
front
and
had
a
toasty
dry
finish
with
bitter
hops
all
along
the
way
very
good
beer
very
easy
enjoyable
drinking
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
gold
color
and
formed
an
amazing
sudsy
white
head
the
lace
was
an
incredible
airy
cloudlike
style
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
the
aroma
was
of
fruit
and
floralperfume
hops
the
flavor
was
of
hops
and
fruit
rather
light
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
flavor
and
finish
could
be
better
bottle
conditioned
light
amber
color
aroma
suggests
light
toasted
grains
some
fruit
maybe
apricot
and
mildly
floral
hop
as
with
most
in
this
style
consume
at
about
55
f
the
flavors
intensify
as
it
warms
especially
its
moderate
hops
classic
english
bitter
a
decent
bitter
notes
eclectic
with
a
raw
flare
to
it
being
that
it
is
bottleconditioned
what
else
would
you
expect
at
3
99
a
bottle
it
was
pushing
the
expensive
side
a
little
but
if
you
enjoy
a
real
ale
than
it
is
worth
every
cent
yeast
layer
stuck
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
on
the
paleish
side
of
amber
medium
to
big
bubbled
34
inch
head
slightly
yeasty
and
skunked
aroma
light
bodied
mouthfeel
malt
is
nonassertive
and
quite
neutral
hops
are
moderately
sharp
but
hard
to
classify
as
to
taste
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
a
little
thin
and
hard
to
describe
a
bit
of
lime
infusion
is
apparent
the
pale
malts
dont
add
a
lot
of
interest
a
little
on
the
dull
side
to
me
the
expiration
was
rubbed
off
the
bottle
so
maybe
age
dulled
delicate
flavors
the
bottle
was
kind
of
dusty
i
have
no
idea
how
fresh
this
bottle
was
the
best
before
date
was
very
faint
and
hardly
ledgible
light
ambergold
airy
head
disappated
quickly
but
did
leave
decent
lacing
it
had
that
wonderful
english
smoothness
and
drinkability
i
bet
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
would
be
outstanding
im
going
to
try
this
again
in
the
near
future
from
a
different
store
top
rating
for
drinkability
comes
from
the
fact
that
it
was
pretty
darn
good
despite
my
doubts
about
the
age
this
is
a
good
english
bitter
light
biscuit
malt
flavor
with
an
up
front
citrus
hop
flavor
and
aroma
with
a
mild
bitterness
o
good
for
style
dont
drink
a
lot
of
bitters
but
would
recommend
on
cask
at
ashleys
saturday
night
poured
into
an
imperial

clear
brass

with
a

were
light
with

and
earthy

standing
outflavors
are
dry
and
earthy
with
a
tinge
of
ironmetal
a
firm
dryer
biscuit
base
is
there
throughout
a
simple
easy
drinking
cask
bitter
wich
its
supposed
to
be
o
unfortunately
this
beer
did
not
really
benefit
from
being
served
on
nitro
it
came
out
a
little
too
creamy
almost
like
a
cream
ale
i
think
this
beer
would
be
best
served
on
cask
with
light
amounts
of
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
decent
run
of
the
mill
mild
the
nitro
made
it
drink
like
water
and
nothing
was
off
but
it
was
surprisingly
bland
even
as
a
fan
of
milds
i
got
bored
with
this
one
a
standout
specialty
beer
perfect
for
the
spring
on

some
bready

along
with
just
a
touch
of

good
earthy
floral

in
the
background
then
coming
through
into
the

nice
malty

that

still
fairly
thin
without
being
watery
light

a
hazy

amber
with
decent

has
a
distinct
white

note
which
is
very
surprisingly
pleasant
and
interesting
flavor
is
apple

mild
english
green

and
a
very
dry

there
is
an
acidic
astringency
that
bites
the
throat
as
it
goes
down

again
not
offensive
lightly

after
the

session

beer
for
lunchtime
looks
fairly
standard
when
poured
in

glass
amberbrown
in
color
with
really
no
head
but
consistent
with
this
style
smells
of
apples
bread
and
other
spices
maybe
some
nutmeg
taste
is
wonderful
with
the
same
notes
hit
from
the
aroma
after
many
trips
to
london
this
is
the
best
delivery
of
this
type
of
beer
west
of
the
atlantic
whats
better
is
the
low
abv
definite
session
beer
d
excellent
the
best
bitter
i
have
had
since
the
last
time
i
was
in
the
uk
and
honestly
better
than
most
even
there
great
yeast
character
and
rich
malt
with
just
enough
hops
to
impart
the
requisite
bitterness
and
keep
it
balanced
im
really
glad
i
got
to
have
it
from
a
cask
as
that
probably
made
a
huge
difference
overall
an
excellent
beer
for
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
casket
beers
i
have
had
highly
drinkable
which
doesnt
sacrifice
flavor
to
be
so
very
smooth
feel
low
carbonation
medium
bodied
cask
treatment
very
well
done
avoids
being
at
all
watery
feels
quite
soft
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
easy
a
very
tasty
offering

notes

2012
the
beginning
of
philly
beer
week
overall
one
wonderful
session
beer
it
has
good
malty
flavors
mixed
with
some
sweet
and
hop
favors
mixed
within
very
drinkable
feels
like
a
lot
of
water
in
the
mouth
and
some
light
tannic
effect
not
much
else
pour
is
light
amber
little
to
no
head
sweet
caramel
malts
and
some
thanksgiving
spice
with
hints
of
pepper
and
sugar
taste
is
caramel
malts
being
taken
by
iced
tea
with
some
light
peppery
spice
and
a
touch
of
hearbal
hops
creamy
body
low
carb
from
cask
a
touch
oily
iced
tea
flavor
dominates
and
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
beer
appeared
a
very
nice
clear
copper
color
with
hints
of
red
with
a
great
thick
creamy
slightly
offwhite
head
the
head
was
fairly
well
retained
but
eventually
faded
into
nothing
no
noticeable
carbonation
the
aroma
was
mild
mostly
malty
with
a
hint
of
yeast
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
great
extremely
well
balanced
and
the
fact
that
the
beer
was
served
at
a
warmer
temp
really
made
the
beer
more
enjoyable
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
creamy
smooth
and
exceptional
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
hope
that
i
get
to
enjoy
this
one
again
handpumped
into
a
pint
glass
this
esb
was
a
clear
golden
brown
fairly
low
carbonation
with
a
small
head
of
delicate
white
bubbles
that
completely
disappeared
before
the
end
of
the
drinking
session
lots
of
caramel
and
yeast
in
the
nose
very
clean
and
fresh
nice
taste
with
caramel
and
honey
bready
yeast
and
a
great
balance
of
hop
bitterness
that
makes
this
beer
distinctive
yet
very
accessible
medium
body
a
bit
chewy
and
left
a
bit
of
syrupy
film
in
the
mouth
overall
drinkable
and
enjoyable
definitely
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
had
on
cask
at
victory
has
a
citrus
hop
nose
pours
a
light
amber
mostly
gold
color
nice
frothy
head
with
suds
that
lace
the
glass
taste
is
mostly
pale
or
base
malt
would
like
to
see
more
of
a
maltlike
character
whether
biscuit
or
bread
or
light
caramel
i
think
the
hops
mask
the
malts
nice
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
got
a
half
pint
of
this
from
the
cask
at
victory
brewing
co
a
beautiful
beer
an
ambergolden
body
with
a
fluffy
12
fingered
head
having
this
beer
at
a
warmer
temp
from
the
cask
really
enhances
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
this
bitter
really
is
spectacular
and
it
has
a
bit
more
cone
hop
presence
than
others
which
makes
it
quite
appetizing
the
light
caramel
malt
backbone
holds
up
the
extra
bitterness
from
the
hops
leading
to
quite
an
impressive
brew
very
smooth
and
silky
drinking
the
head
is
like
diving
into
a
cloud
relatively
recently
at
rattle
n
hums
victory
promo
about
2
months
ago
poured
a
translucent
gold
with
less
than
a
finger
of
white
and
less
than
stellar
retention
and
lacing
no
visible
carbonation
wasnt
surprising
given
the
cask
origin
the
smell
was
a
robust
bouquet
of
rosemary
and
other
spices
that
i
couldnt
place
mixed
with
grass
and
sugary
apple
the
taste
was
very
nice
as
well
tasting
more
like
a
saison
rather
than
a
bitter
and
finishing
on
a
dry
apple
note
noncarbonated
smooth
texture
and
surprisingly
thin
which
certainly
aided
its
sessionability
fantastic
session
brew
it
definitely
tasted
as
if
the
folks
from
victory
used
the
hops
left
over
from
brewing
saison
du
buff
to
brew
this
great
beer
given
the
herbalspicey
profile
no
complaints
here
d
with
the
combo
of
the
low
abv
and
toned
down
flavors
this
one
is
highly
quaffable
i
could
literally
drink
this
all
day
i
had
on
cask
at
the
brewpub
served
in
an
imperial
pint
the
beer
is
hazy
straw
in
color
with
a
delicate
little
white
head
the
nose
is
earthy
and
hay
like
it
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
subtle
flavors
hay
sweet
malt
and
a
pleasant
breadiness
the
beer
finishes
with
light
bitterness
i
know
understand
why
people
have
to
have
bitters
on
cask
a
really
well
done
brew
pours
a
relatively
pale
and
lightly
hazed
straw
color
with
a
cap
of
white
head
with
big
bubbles
from
the
hand
pump
pour
scent
is
light
and
made
up
of
bread
nuts
flowers
honey
toffee
and
earth
taste
suprised
me
the
light
color
and
scent
decieve
as
the
components
of
scent
come
forward
and
make
a
nice
nearly
full
flavored
beer
the
cask
pour
makes
for
a
creamier
mouthfeel
with
lighter
carbonation
great
for
the
style
a
very
nice
flavorful
mild
bitter
maybe
second
only
to
yards
brawler
in
the
4
range
in
terms
of
flavor
with
slightly
more
complexity
wow
i
was
blindsided
by
this
one
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
flavorful
beer
when
i
ordered
this
one
floral
and
fruity
aromas
and
whiffs
of
grain
nice
full
and
fluffy
white
head
palate
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
light
citrus
and
floral
hops
just
enough
dry
bitterness
to
compliment
the
cracker
flavor
of
the
malt
and
yeast
with
great
flavor
and
at
a
sessionable
4
this
is
a
clear
cut
winner
and
a
great
cask
offering
given
the
above
criticisms
drinkability
is
pretty
high
if
you
like
honey
flavor
youll
like
this
ultimately
the
flavors
are
mild
and
inoffensive
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
low
abv
makes
this
a
pretty
easy
drinker
d
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
when
combined
with
the
low
alcohol
content
it
makes
it
perfectly
sessionable
the
beer
poured
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
fine
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
malt
with
slight
floral
hops
and
vanilla
undertones
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
nice
hopa
finish
the
feel
is
medium
and
a
bit
oily
with
a
dy
finish
i
could
drink
these
all
night
especially
during
my
last
hurrah
there
i
had
to
get
a
random
cask
selection
at
the
ck
my
brother
helped
me
choose
this
one
it
pours
a
slightly
hazed
pale
straw
topped
by
a
tiny
smattering
of
bubbles
yearning
to
be
taken
seriously
as
a
head
in
vain
i
say
the
nose
comprises
strawberry
ginger
candi
sugar
flowers
and
caramel
the
taste
is
surprisingly
simpler
considering
the
smell
notes
of
wheat
flowers
and
corn
are
all
that
make
up
the
assault
on
my
buds
this
meager
list
does
well
though
even
if
not
very
far
the
body
is
light
with
no
real
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bitter
as
simple
and
understated
as
it
gets
while
still
keeping
my
interest
beer
is
clean
and
creamy
moderately
bitter
with
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
and
great
midpalate
flavors
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
just
a
good
all
around
beer
nothing
odd
or
extreme
just
a
good
cask
ale
beautiful
amber
in
color
with
a
dense
soft
offwhite
head
with
just
phenomenal
retention
and
lacing
this
is
an
outrageously
beautiful
beer
the
nose
is
outstanding
toffee
butterscotch
caramel
minerals
earth
mild
minty
and
a
touch
of
fruity
english
yeast
this
puts
the
craft
back
into
craft
beer
the
palate
opens
with
butterscotch
vanilla
and
caramel
with
some
minerals
coming
through
drying
finish
with
earthy
and
herbal
hop
character
this
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
soft
carbonation
and
is
just
eminently
drinkable
its
easy
or
at
least
easier
to
make
a
great
tasting
beer
with
10
or
more
alcohol
but
a
beer
with
this
much
flavor
and
4
alcohol
is
a
rarity
exceptional
well
done
victory
drinkability
this
is
a
good
well
made
bitter
that
ive
enjoyed
drinking
and
that
ill
be
having
again
d
a
god
representation
of
the
classic
style
but
just
not
doing
enough
for
me
crazily
drinkable
though
thanks
to
an
extremely
light
body
and
mild
taste
a
good
first
beer
for
happy
hour
while
waiting
for
friends
to
show
up
before
moving
onto
some
bigger
guns
a
lot
of
time
when
i
order
a
beer
from
a
cask
i
really
get
the
feeling
that
the
brewer
just
threw
a
beer
into
a
cask
without
really
thinking
about
whether
that
beer
belongs
there
or
not
uncle
teddys
bitter
is
not
this
way
it
is
perfectly
suited
to
be
drank
at
room
temperature
from
a
hand
pump
d
crazy
good
so
drinkable
i
almost
gave
this
a
five
but
i
still
was
compelled
to
try
several
of
the
15
beers
at
the
brewpub
so
it
didnt
keep
me
locked
in
but
it
could
have
like
i
said
at
3
9
combined
with
the
super
smoothness
i
could
drink
about
20
of
these
things
except
for
the
fact
its
4
00
a
pint
dr
very
very
drinkable
had
we
not
been
on
bikes
and
sitting
on
a
warm
humid
patio
id
have
had
another
or
two
for
my
first
beer
of
the
night
this
one
really
did
it
for
me
if
there
werent
so
many
other
great
victory
brews
to
try
i
wouldve
likely
sat
down
at
the
bar
and
had
at
least
4
more
of
these
orangeish
in
color
with
little
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
simple
some
light
malts
and
a
very
faint
hop
smell
this
was
a
very
simple
palatable
beer
the
bitter
kick
was
so
subdued
compared
to
my
previous
experience
with
bitters
perhaps
thats
the
result
of
something
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
beer
being
deliciously
warm
mellowing
it
out
i
dont
know
it
had
a
nice
bready
flavor
with
a
little
caramel
malt
as
well
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
with
little
carbonation
drinkability
well
that
was
off
the
charts
dont
drink
and
review
a
nice
englishstyle
cask
conditioned
ale
beautiful
goldencopper
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
nose
shows
a
strong
hop
floral
presence
for
a
mild
taste
as
well
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
toostrong
hop
back
note
for
a
mild
kind
of
a
mild
and
one
half
good
finish
this
is
brewed
as
a
session
beer
and
does
not
disappoint
a
decent
bitter
but
far
from
my
favorite
the
hops
werent
quite
as
assertive
as
i
would
have
expected
and
the
yeast
is
a
bit
too
upfront
drinkability

all
in
all
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
on
cask
recommend
it
to
all
overall
a
beer
ive
been
wanting
for
a
few
years
now
lived
up
to
what
i
was
hoping
for
if
you
visit
victory
pass
on
the
food
and
drink
1
of
these
a
really
solid
example
of
a
bitter
from
victory
that
keeps
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
packed
in
while
still
maintaining
that
lower
abv
i
love
the
fact
that
they
keep
this
on
cask
at
all
times
now
at
the
brewery
as
the
silky
body
only
adds
to
its
immense
sessionalbility
im
always
up
for
a
pint
or
six
of
this
when
we
visit
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
poured
amber
with
a
decent
head
and
decent
clarity
smelled
mostly
gentle
and
nutty
with
some
light
roasted
malt
aromas
very
nice
taste
creamy
nutty
well
balanced
with
a
nice
earthy
bitterness
to
finish
some
slight
herbal
notes
of
sage
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
an
herbal
dry
finish
a
little
rich
for
the
style
but
still
quite
a
nice
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
that
is
fogged
creme
head
that
stays
nose
is
hoppy
and
slightly
woody
flavor
is
just
as
described
caskish
hops
are
definitely
there
smooth
and
nice
definitely
bitter
but
in
a
smooth
way
feel
is
very
smooth
great
carbonation
and
a
smooth
liquid
overall
a
great
treat
to
be
able
to
have
well
worth
trying
d
a
real
joy
incredibly
sessionable
and
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
again
at
some
point
definitely
recommended
this
could
even
be
a
very
good
gateway
beer
as
it
doesnt
assault
the
palate
with
overdone
hops
or
alcohol
a
delightful
surprise
this
would
make
for
an
awesome
session
beer
this
ale
was
very
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
from
the
cask
if
i
see
it
available
again
i
shall
drink
more
of
it
a
great
session
beer
i
hope
to
see
more
of
this
from
victory
served
in
a
4
liter
glass
from
a
beer
engine
brewed
with
german
malts
and
styrian
and
kent
goldings
hops
it
arrives
at
the
table
a
lightlyhazed
caramel
with
low
carbonation
and
an
inch
of
creamy
head
that
deposits
nice
lacing
gently
hoppy
in
the
nose
with
a
sturdy
backing
of
toasted
and
biscuity
malts
similar
on
the
palate
with
notes
of
citricgrassy
and
leafyspicy
hops
it
has
a
medium
body
that
is
smooth
and
creamy
low
in
carbonation
and
leaves
a
medium
hoppy
finish
very
enjoyable
ale
with
excellent
mouthfeel
and
flavor
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
see
it
at
the
brewery
d
i
have
at
least
one
every
time
it
is
on
at
the
brewery
one
of
my
favorite
beers
something
that
could
be
drunk
all
night
long
victory
has
done
it
again
this
will
be
a
staple
from
now
on
every
time
i
make
my
way
to
downingtown
d
made
for
sessioning
and
hits
the
mark
d
pretty
standard
britishstyle
esb
with
kent
golding
hop
profile
not
a
bad
cask
offering
from
victory
not
my
favorite
esb
but
id
have
another
especially
on
cask
appears
a
clouded
amber
orange
hue
forms
a
vibrant
creamy
tan
head
froth
and
thick
with
thick
even
bands
of
lacing
that
develop
with
each
sip
good
cask
conditioned
gets
harder
to
come
by
in
the
burgh
as
time
goes
on
bars
that
used
to
carry
a
cask
or
two
dont
anymore
its
really
a
shame
well
this
flowing
at
fatheads
and
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
i
knew
what
i
would
drinking
at
least
a
few
of
aroma
has
roasted
caramel
with
nutty
edges
herbal
funky
uk
hops
with
just
a
finish
of
piney
hoppiness
flavor
is
mildly
bitter
nothing
overplays
anything
else
session
beer
at
its
best
cant
hide
any
off
flavors
in
a
brew
like
this
definitely
a
technical
display
of
talent
that
slick
oily
rush
of
hops
quickly
disperses
with
the
roasted
malt
nut
flavors
like
a
said
just
a
clean
drinkable
mix
of
flavorful
beer
were
both
sweetness
and
hop
flavor
have
multiple
dimensions
mouthfeel
is
of
course
the
strength
of
most
cask
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
creamy
fluffy
body
with
hop
oils
streaking
the
palate
natural
light
carbonation
goes
down
with
such
ease
no
alcohol
burn
when
its
3
54
abv
drinkability
anytime
i
see
this
one
flowing
hopefully
next
time
i
belly
up
to
a
long
wooden
bar
in
downingtown
that
would
be
a
nice
place
to
meet
up
with
this
brew
again
pours
a
cloudy
orangeish
color
with
a
off
white
head
aromas
that
are
hoppy
and
a
sweet
maltiness
in
the
taste
there
is
a
small
bitter
a
sweet
maltiness
and
a
nice
presence
of
fruitiness
a
light
bitter
yet
mellow
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
sticky
bitter
aftertaste
a
nice
sessiony
bitter
a
bit
light
and
water
in
taste
but
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
one
helluva
session
beer
easy
to
drink
with
a
great
flavor
i
was
tempted
to
waste
my
night
in
downingtown
downing
pints
of
this
beer
d
a
great
beer
that
is
only
available
at
the
brewery
this
one
goes
high
on
my
list
of
session
beers
it
was
so
good
i
stayed
alittle
longer
at
the
pub
so
i
could
have
another
i
very
very
special
brew
to
be
sure
pale
in
colour
this
offering
presents
in
all
its
gravity
fed
glory
fantastic
notes
of
bready
goodness
and
mild
fruity
hops
to
balance
this
highly
quaffable
brew
smooth
on
the
palate
to
say
the
least
the
hops
played
a
predominant
role
on
the
tongue
but
was
balanced
with
some
nice
biscuitiness
the
prototypical
session
brew
if
there
ever
was
one
drinkability
excellent
example
of
a
style
that
is
rarely
brewed
on
these
shores
hazy
caramelorange
colour
with
a
superdense
cream
coloured
head
great
retention
and
thick
solid
rings
of
lace
were
left
behind
at
each
sip
sweet
caramel
and
citrusy
piney
hop
aroma
solid
bitterness
throughout
with
plenty
of
malt
up
front
fresh
grain
character
and
a
bit
of
hop
character
low
carbonation
with
a
slight
astringent
graininess
an
excellent
session
brew
that
really
shines
in
the
cask
format
served
a
medium
copper
colored
beer
with
creamy
white
head
smell
is
superb
with
a
nice
mixture
of
malt
and
hops
taste
is
even
better
than
the
smell
with
the
malt
and
hops
forming
an
excellent
balance
finished
with
a
moderate
dryness
that
is
supremely
refreshing
the
perfect
session
beer
with
modest
alcohol
content
great
taste
and
perfect
drinkability
definitely
a
winner
cheers
feel
is
100
smooth
this
beer
came
a
bright
golden
brown
with
an
off
white
creamy
head
that
had
a
guinness
like
cascade
effect
going
on
that
left
some
nice
lacing
smelled
of
oatmeal
sour
dirty
pineapple
and
maple
syrup
tasted
of
creamy
corn
smoky
caramel
copper
and
grass
that
faded
into
a
pleasant
dryness
that
tingled
my
tongue
mouth
feel
was
very
light
and
thin
with
very
tiny
bubbles
i
could
definitely
knock
back
a
few
more
of
these
on
cask
at
cah
pours
a
hazy
orange
i
let
it
sit
and
had
another
brew
while
i
waited
the
bartender
had
the
decency
to
not
sit
this
on
the
ice
rail
small
head
and
gobs
of
lace
a
little
aspirin
in
the
flavor
but
dominated
by
a
mild
malt
smoothness
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
big
smooth
finish
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
brews
ive
had
in
awhile
buttery
and
wonderful
recommended
cask
draught
victory
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
color
mine
was
pulled
with
a
thick
creamy
head
on
top
there
was
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
light
and
consists
of
a
bit
of
malts
and
spiciness
the
taste
is
very
good
it
is
a
somewhat
dry
malt
taste
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
that
results
in
no
sweetness
but
limited
bitterness
a
tad
biscuity
also
this
was
also
served
at
cellar
temperature
an
excellent
session
beer
overall
one
of
my
favorites
from
by
far
my
favorite
brewery
incredibly
delicious
stuff
from
the
hand
pump
quite
drinkable
enjoyed
while
touring
victory
tnite
this
beer
shows
victorys
incredible
versatility
they
do
bigbeers
well
but
they
do
mediumstrength
beers
well
and
they
do
these
small
beers
well
also
my
hat
is
off
to
them
bravo
victory
scores
again
with
this
bitter
tasted
like
an
ordinary
bitter
to
me
which
not
many
us
brewers
dare
to
touch
being
that
it
is
such
a
delicate
style
to
tangle
with
a
good
rounded
malt
sweetness
throws
toasted
crackers
and
a
mild
fruitiness
to
the
taste
buds
hops
were
at
a
impeccable
level
of
balance
the
caskconditioned
smoothness
was
so
impressive
that
i
wanted
to
quaff
this
one
all
night
great
job
guys
i
really
enjoyed
my
experience
with
this
beer
a
session
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
pint
after
pint
after
pint
i
once
thought
that
cask
beers
appearance
was
unappealing
but
not
any
more
i
think
cask
ales
are
a
beautiful
thing
to
behold
a
very
nice
fruity
yeast
flavor
with
just
enough
hops
to
barely
overpower
the
malt
in
this
beer
im
not
sure
how
this
would
be
in
a
bottle
or
from
a
keg
but
from
the
cask
it
was
excellent
had
this
on
the
hand
pump
at
the
brewery
and
was
glad
i
did
poured
a
hazy
gold
haze
mostly
due
to
carbonation
with
a
nice
bright
white
foam
layer
on
top
aroma
was
pretty
subdued
but
hinted
at
apples
and
pears
with
a
dash
of
malt
sweetness
very
mild
tasting
with
no
overly
strong
flavors
and
a
very
clean
finish
hints
of
pears
and
apples
and
the
malt
sweetness
carried
over
from
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
amazingly
smoothe
going
down
a
truly
impressive
feat
and
something
i
have
not
experienced
very
often
in
a
beer
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
not
get
sick
of
it
if
you
go
to
the
pub
you
must
try
this
one
of
course
you
could
say
that
about
all
their
beers
one
of
the
most
authentic
domestically
produced
englishstyle
bitters
and
an
ordinary
to
boot
once
its
settled
from
the
handpump
pour
the
body
is
a
hazy
golden
with
an
orange
cast
thats
topped
by
a
thin
cap
of
creamy
bright
white
foam
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
lace
the
aroma
is
limited
but
offers
a
subtly
fruity
mostly
malty
character
with
a
light
earthiness
thats
probably
contributed
to
by
hops
although
theyre
not
distinct
the
flavor
is
quite
mild
combining
a
soft
clean
thin
maltiness
with
a
light
floral
and
earthy
hop
flavor
the
body
is
light
with
an
exceptionally
fine
carbonation
thats
extremely
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
the
finish
continues
much
as
it
started
but
without
the
sharper
hop
flavor
the
bitterness
is
very
well
balanced
and
does
just
enough
to
keep
the
pint
interesting
serious
session
brew
poured
from
handpump
creating
a
smooth
creamy
beer
very
drinkable
silky
mouthfeel
lacks
the
snappy
flavor
of
victorys
single
hop
esb
great
beer
if
your
not
in
the
mood
for
a
very
aggressive
style
mild
malts
citrusy
hops
excellent
session
brew
i
picked
this
up
in
a
standard
6
pack
12oz
cans
bitters
are
probably
my
second
favorite
beer
outside
of
belgian
ales
while
this
one
is
not
the
best
ive
had
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
you
definitely
get
that
malty
bready
biscuit
flavor
which
i
love
not
much
lacing
and
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
over
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
forget
the
price
but
it
wasnt
expensive
this
will
certainly
end
up
in
my
fridge
many
times
overall
i
dont
think
camra
would
approve
as
this
is
in
the
can
i
had
the
pleasure
of
having
this
on
tap
and
it
was
much
improved
by
the
change
in
format
even
in
the
can
there
is
a
taste
of
london
much
fainter
in
the
can
but
take
an
average
person
to
a
pub
in
london
and
serve
them
4
proper
pints
and
this
i
doubt
most
would
be
able
to
pick
it
out
worth
a
try
enough
poetic
waxing
the
crack
was
nice
and
loud
so
i
celebrated
with
an
inverted
glug
this
caused
the
formation
of
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
rocky
eggshellwhite
head
with
decent
retention
i
was
fascinated
to
watch
it
slowly
fall
leaving
dense
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
who
is
going
to
clean
that
up

tastes
like
amateur
homebrew
to
me
like
someones
first
pale
ale
or
some
bland
bottomshelf
english
beer
on
the
whole
i
think
oasis
hit
this
one
out
of
the
park
i
have
yet
to
drink
anything
else
from
them
but
this
particular
offering
stands
out
among
most
other
recent
austintexas
upstarts
i
love
having
a
local
bitter
in
cans
for
the
times
i
want
something
a
little
more
subtle
and
sessionable
than
other
great
locals
like
zoe
and
four
squared
and
even
real
ale
white
pours
out
hazy
and
much
like
a
snpa
in
color
nose
is
very
subdued
i
dont
get
a
whole
lot
of
english
character
from
the
smell
flavor
reminds
me
of
green
homebrew
yeast
is
a
bit
heavy
handed
but
not
in
a
tasty
british
way
malt
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desire
a
bit
of
toast
and
too
grainy
for
me
hops
give
it
a
grassy
and
citrusy
quality
carbonation
is
a
touch
out
of
hand
overall
this
is
somewhat
passable
but
i
expected
more
really
mellow
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
fruity
undertones
are
limited
but
present
dark
juicy
fruits
black
barry
and
fig
but
malt
forward
on
a
light

hop
taste
is
minimal
not
toasty
either
just
a
fat
malt
bomb
english
bitter
with
some
fruity
notes
interesting
i
got
a
couple
from
this
new
brewery
and
im
anxious
to
try
the
next
one
too
great
to
see
new
craft
breweries
in
tx
as
im
always
wanting
to
buy
local
mouth
is
decent
and
fits
the
style
meh
i
dont
care
to
go
into
it
perhaps
i
need
to
try
it
again
satisfying
and
thirst
quenching
delicious
beverage
solid
refreshing
amber
nothing
special
but
a
repeat
good
swillin
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
toasted
malt
the
taste
is
nice
and
smooth
with
a
lot
of
the

again
with
many
that
i
have
tasted
nothing
fundamentally
wrong
but
there
is
also
nothing
that
shines
as
being
outstanding
liked
tho
one
more
than
i
expected
nose
is
terrific
and
the
flavor
is
solid
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
flavorful
beer
to
session
with
for
a
long
time
o
a
good
american
amber
described
as
amber
ale
on
the
label
another
that
is
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
prefer
for
an
amber
or
even
an
english
bitter
what
its
called
here
but
the
malt
base
is
evident
enough
and
it
makes
a
good
dinner
or
pub
drink
would
buy
it
again
but
it
is
not
easy
to
find
and
there
are
some
i
like
a
bit
more
lets
put
it
this
way
if
none
of
my
favorites
were
on
tap
but
this
one
was
id
probably
pick
the
naughty
nurse
and
not
just
because
asking
for
it
would
be
worth
a
smile
overall
pretty
average
esb
or
amber
ale
like
the
label
says
it
is
more
true
to
the
bitter
style
o
for
being
an
english
bitter
this
beer
didnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
bitterness
i
would
have
liked
this
beer
a
lot
better
if
it
didnt
taste
like
cough
syrup
the
sip
is
far
more
bitter
than
the
smell
indicates
the
malt
base
is
briefits
not
sweet
but
it
has
some
elements
of
caramel
and
powdered
malt
the
hop
provides
bitterness
but
little
complexity
the
aftertaste
is
long
thin
bodied
with
an
elevated
level
of
carbonation
comes
to
the
table
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
head
but
a
decent
amount
of
lace
smells
of
light
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
earthy
spicy
hop
to
provide
some
balance
the
flavor
is
earth
and
spicy
hop
with
a
hint
of
skunk
and
a
solid
caramel
malty
backbone
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
sweet
mouthfeel
nice
approachable
easy
drinking
ale
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
ordered
a
follow
up
very
drinkable
english
bitter
ale
overall
i
think
city
steams
naughty
nurse
is
nothing
spectacular
but
definitely
nothing
to
reject
this
is
a
fine
brewed
beer
with
nice
flavor
and
versatility
restaurants
would
be
wise
to
have
it
on
their
menu
personally
id
find
it
hard
to
pass
up
to
accompany
a
meal
or
hardy
sandwich
o
overall
fairly
averagestandard
beer
would
not
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
pours
copper
a
little
hazy
with
chestnut
hue
a
fabulous
head
of
soft
creamy
foam
that
fell
off
oh
so
slowly
like
a
tease
it
really
does
have
a
come
hither
look
sticky
lace
and
thick
cap
smells
great
with
fat
malt
and
light
citrus
lemon
and
floral
are
light
as
a
feather
on
a
bread
biscuit
caramel
malt
spine
malt
opens
up
deep
and
sweet
taste
is
gentle
clean
crystal
malt
with
a
good
honey
and
butter
sweetness
slightly
nutty
alongside
hops
that
are
as
gentle
as
a
spring
breeze
with
some
earth
and
floral
and
not
quite
too
bitter
just
enough
bitter
to
lean
in
on
the
back
palate
it
was
a
touch
watery
and
thin
drank
smooth
and
bittersweet
and
had
a
silky
mouthfeel
with
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
to
tickle
the
throat
really
good
notes
quite
drinkable
a
good
smooth
finish
cheers
o
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
sessionable
though
i
probably
was
not
a
big
enough
fan
to
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
grassyearth
hops
that
i
expect
for
the
style
overall
meh
this
wouldnt
be
too
bad
for
an
underhopped
english
amber
or
red
ale
but
as
a
bitter
this
misses
the
mark
but
quite
a
bit
hops
are
barely
detectable
and
just
a
bit
of
earthy
grassy
flavors
way
too
much
on
the
malt
side
for
a
bitter
even
if
the
hops
were
bigger
and
malts
seem
too
much
on
the
candy
caramel
sweet
side
again
for
a
bitter
mild
and
laid
back
but
not
bad
nothing
off
or
abrasive
here
herbal
and
spicy
hop
forward
with
some
decent
malt
backing
perhaps
balance
can
be
found
by
paring
this
with
spicy
chinese
food
or
perhaps
with
dessert
adding
something
citrus
may
be
another
good
idea
i
would
certainly
try
this
again
as
it
was
well
above
average
cheers
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
would
gladly
try
it
again
it
wasnt
good
enough
to
seek
it
out
but
was
certainly
good
enough
not
to
pass
it
up
if
offered
a
nice
american
made
bitter
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
solid
beer
o
an
alright
beer
overall
nothing
special
but
not
bad
at
all
cheers
o
this
is
a
nice
full
bodied
amber
ale
with
decent
malt
presence
and
a
little
bitterness
this
was
a
surprisingly
good
brew
i
had
on
draft
at
xl
center
in
hartford
during
a
huskies
game
and
another
on
tap
at
city
steam
i
found
it
to
be
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
alternative
to
the
other
macros
on
draft
at
xl
i
then
bought
this
in
bottle
six
pack
and
was
equally
impressed
actually
more
impressed
as
far
as
ambers
go
it
holds
up
in
all
categories
ambers
arent
my
go
to
but
im
always
curious
to
see
whats
available
as
a
local
brew
overall
a
quality
and
satisfying
beer
d
this
beer
wont
blow
anyone
away
but
still
enjoyable
to
drink
naughty
nurse
has
good
flavor
and
goes
down
easy
great
session
beer
no
hints
of
abv
and
a
very
easy
to
drink
brew
grabbed
a
bottle
at
the
red
door
in
my
home
town
of
watertown
ct
this
amber
ale
is
a
deep
copper
color
clear
and
fairly
quiet
the
head
is
just
a
thin
offwhite
cover
but
the
lacing
is
decent
the
aroma
brings
a
solid
molasses
caramel
malt
that
seems
promising
the
flavor
says
much
the
same
with
more
of
the
distinctive
molasses
with
peachy
fruit
highlights
and
a
subtle
pinch
of
herbal
hop
its
mediumlight
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
and
a
slightly
chalky
feel
its
not
bad
certainly
a
bit
of
a
statement
compared
to
the
average
amber
ale
but
i
think
it
could
do
with
just
a
little
bit
more
of
the
molasses
power
to
make
this
better
than
simply
distinctive
it
seems
a
little
watery
at
times
but
not
enough
to
ruin
it
a
different
sort
of
amber
and
well
worth
a
try
overall
this
isnt
a
style
i
would
normally
go
for
but
this
beer
isnt
bad
if
i
were
offered
one
i
would
happily
drink
it
if
it
were
available
here
i
would
probably
not
ever
buy
it
o
defeinitly
would
have
another
but
sadley
only
have
this
one
thanks
okey
overall
not
sure
if
this
is
good
for
a
bitter
or
pale
ale
when
i
was
drinking
it
i
thought
sweet
amber
ale
there
is
a
nice
mix
but
the
malt
triumphs
not
out
of
the
ordinary
but
nothing
to
pass
over
either
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
amber
with
small
head
and
decent
retention
of
lacing
aroma
is
malty
with
some
hops
and
yeast
mouthfeel
is
light
taste
is
of
hops
yeast
and
is
just
overall
watered
down
tasting
it
is
just
ok
not
too
bad
but
not
that
great
either
pretty
mild
and
smooth
but
not
too
flavorfulmemorable
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
light
head
that
settled
quickly
light
mildly
hoppy
aroma
and
taste
easy
drinking
light
mouthfeel
not
something
id
reorder
but
nice
for
those
who
dont
live
dangerously
if
you
like
caramel
than
this
is
your
beer
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
bitter
but
nice
just
he
same
taste
a
lighter
tasting
beer
with
a
unique
flavor
instantly
became
one
of
my
favorites
really
good
beer
very
drinkable
will
seek
out
again

out

i
have
enjoyed
this
ontap
at
their
brewpub
there
a
couple
years
ago
now
it
is
nice
to
have
the
option
to
pick
this
up
at
the
local
package
store
12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
color
with
minimal
head
some
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
malts
and
spices
taste
is
mostly
spices
at
first
with
some
maltiness
to
it
somewhat
bready
spices
in
the
finish
overall
this
beer
is
okay
but
im
hoping
this
is
just
the
beginning
of
city
steam
bottling
its
beers
i
would
really
like
to
see
acapulco
gold
or
the
summer
stout
in
6
packs
for
now
this
entry
is
eh
d
very
drinkable
nice
mix
of
flavors
nice
body
and
overall
a
nice
beer
i
am
glad
they
started
bottling
this
its
nice
to
have
more
local
stuff
d
very
much
so
kinda
wish
i
had
this
available
on
tap
when
i
wanted
a
fresh
esb
d
pretty
smooth
choice
for
the
sourdough
swiss
burger
i
had
and
for
quaffing
back
in
the
fading
sunset
of
an
early
summer
day
as
was
the
scenario
this
evening
not
off
the
charts
in
terms
of
flavor
but
quite
serviceable
and
a
nice
take
on
the
pint
of
english
bitter
overallprofessional
bitter
if
not
spectacular
poured
from
tap
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
and
excellent
lacing
aromas
are
of
citrus
a
bit
of
wheat
and
some
grassy
like
elements
this
one
has
a
nice
tinge
of
maltiness
in
the
back
upon
tasting
the
grapefruit
flavors
compliments
the
malt
up
front
mouthfeel
is
perfect
a

finish
this
one
was
much
better
the
second
time
around
a
pretty
unique
beer
to
have
as
a
flagship
brew
the
naughtly
nurse
is
a
popular
beer
at
city
steam
some
part
due
to
its
mischievous
name
no
doubt
in
truth
its
a
decent
well
balanced
pale
ale
nothing
amazing
but
very
drinkable
color
is
a
light
brown
to
amber
a
little
bit
of
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
smells
like
a
lighter
pale
ale
aroma
of
subtle
hops
and
malt
which
matches
the
taste
indeed
the
nurse
goes
down
quite
well
without
any
bitterness
or
major
aftertaste
this
is
a
beer
you
can
drink
a
fair
amount
of
not
too
strong
but
fairly
smooth
and
mellow
pretty
good
for
a
standard
city
steam
beer
but
i
much
prefer
some
of
their
special
brews
draught
lighter
amber
color
it
had
a
little
head
but
not
too
much
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
a
bit
thin
i
get
some
citrus
hops
and
a
little
malt
plus
some
floral
notes
there
is
a
decent
enough
maltiness
to
the
beer
but
pretty
this
on
any
bitterness
to
the
taste
good
but
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
pale
ale
a
typical
standard
house
beer
for
a
micro
good
but
definitely
brewed
for
the
macro
masses
this
seems
to
be
the
flagship
brew
at
least
the
most
popular
perhaps
because
it
has
what
it
takes
for
mass
appeal
better
than
average
in
most
respects
but
it
probably
wont
blow
you
away
light
brown
color
with
a
low
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
slight
hop
aroma
followed
by
a
mellow
hop
flavor
supplemented
with
some
malt
and
fruity
undertones
decent
mouthfeel
but
no
real
lingering
flavors
i
had
high
hopes
it
had
a
frothy
head
it
was
served
well
chilled
i
could
smell
hops
on
the
nose
then
i
drank
it
missed
the
hops
they
were
just
really
weak
is
this
supposed
to
be
a
pale
ale
sure
doesnt
seem
it
the
2nd
beer
i
tried
at
city
steam
im
a
bit
dissapointed
kind
of
a
weak
pale
ale
doesnt
have
the
hop
kick
that
i
expect
from
a
pale
ale
and
had
a
very
thin
body
with
a
short
finnish
ive
found
that
this
places
seasonals
are
much
better
than
their
yearround
products
its
a
little
slick
and
dry
at
the
same
time
though
it
evens
out
and
goes
to
a
cleaner
semidry
in
a
light
but
almost
medium
body
it
goes
into
a
quick
finish
not
really
an
ale
its
more
like
an
india
pale
lager
has
a
really
hoppy
lager
taste
to
it
drink
not
again
i
appreciate
the
wifes
effort
to
give
me
a
can
of
a
namesake
beer
but
man
this
was
bad
overall
this
incarnation
of
fosters
is
pretty
bad
the
brew
pours
a
bright
golden
hue
and
is
capped
with
a
shortlived
fizzy
head
both
the
smell
and
flavor
are
astringent
grainy
alcoholic
and
fairly
strong
on
metallic
flavors
the
feel
is
about
onpar
for
an
aal
but
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
bitter
so
id
expect
a
bit
more
tooth
i
would
not
want
another
one
of
these
keep
it
cold
and
drink
it
on
a
summer
day
better
than
many
of
lager
options
at
the
same
price
point
pours
a
cleanclear
pale
yellow

nice

very
nice
white
onefinger

head
which
leaves

the
taste
is

kinda
malty
grainyricy
medium
body
with
a
not

finish
not
a
bad
brew
alot
better
than
most
american
macros
d
i
think
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
most
aussies
i
know
avoid
this
one
dont
bother
first
taste
and
aroma
have
a
rotgut
alcoholenhanced
edge
and
owing
to
the
added
color
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
jibe
with
the
appearance
so
the
whole
thing
just
ends
up
feeling
like
a
budget
getmedrunkquick
quaff
heaven
knows
weve
all
been
there
but
i
think
we
can
all
aspire
to
our
better
selves
d
very
drinkable
but
tiring
after
a
few
out
of
a
big
green
oil
can
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
amber
color
with
good
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
offwhite
twofingers
displayed
average
retention
and
the
lacing
quite
good
in
broken
fishnets
the
aroma
was
semisweet
macromalt
and
corn
mashgrains
the
flavors
were
more
bitter
than
the
aroma
but
ended
a
little
more
sweet
with
pale
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
mediumhigh
drinkability
scores
low
for
me
since
i
physically
had
a
hard
time
pouring
and
drinking
this
beer
im
sure
i
lost
a
couple
ounces
while
pouring
over
the
sink
and
as
stated
above
theres
little
to
like
about
it
the
aftertaste
was
actually
okay
enough
for
me
to
get
through
the
whole
thing
i
will
be
avoiding
this
one
from
now
on
if
i
wanted
a
cheap
and
easy
to
find
bitter
id
get
a
goose
island
honkers
ale
for
those
with
no
other
choices
for
a
bitter
this
is
may
be
worth
a
try
d
drinkability
is
low
just
average
pair
it
with
some
hot
dogs
on
a
warm
day
nothing
special
but
it
is
an
option
in
a
style
i
like
id
pass
for
some
others
out
there
the
taste
is
smooth
basic
but
good
beer
taste
a
little
like
a
cross
between
an
english
ale
and
an
american
macro
lager
light
caramelly
faintly
toasty
grain
hint
of
leafiness
and
grassiness
it
has

with

i
am
struggling

some

even

its

bland
makes

about

there
is
to
say
some
sweet

come
through

and
the
most
prominent
of
the
bland
flavors
is
the
spicy
hop
finish
i
dont
see
anything
wrong
with
picking
up
a
few
of
these
huge
cans
just
for
something
different

not

one
thing
is
for
sure
from
what
america
recieves
the
special
bitter
is
much
better
than
than

lager
it
appears
with
a
copper
tone
and
an
off

tannish

very
nice
with
a

very
nice
mild
bite
of
hops
paired
with
a
the
caramel
like
sweet
malt
tones
a
bit
light
in
flavor
but
this
beer
overall
works
for
the
balance
of
the
delicate
hop
bouquet
sweet
malt
profile
mouthfeel
is
very
light
in
body
no
consistency
like
water
for
the
style
although
its
decently
carbonated
pretty
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
waste
much
time
on
this
sorry
attempt
at
a
bitter
this
is
a
better
offering
then
the
lagered
blue
label
by
fosters
this
has
a
nice
dark
green
label
and
when
poured
it
gets
a
fairly
sizeable
offwhite
head
with
lots
of
retention
and
the
color
is
a
lightish
brownorange
kinda
pale
looking
smell
is
faint
of
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
citrusy
fruit
hop
taste
is
well
rounded
for
a
bitter
very
smooth
and
semisweet
with
a
nice
drying
bitterness
but
is
dull
and
not
as
bright
and
toothy
as
other
esb
types
feel
is
a
very
sturdy
medium
body
with
a
good
sweet
semibittering
hold
and
finish
not
bad
its
a
tad
lighter
in
the
bite
for
a
bitter
but
is
smooth
enough
to
suck

down
easy

an
average

i
dare
say
if
i
were
trapped
in

i
would
go
for

the

a

poured
this

ounce
oil
can
of
beer
into
my
large
weizen
glass
32
oz
and
was
greeted
by
a
beautiful
copper
colored
beer
with
a
magnificent
head
that
very
slowly
faded
to
a
light
rocky
foam
thick
veins
of
lace
were
left
at
the
top
of
the
glass
with
moderate
lacing
appearing
while
drinking
the
beer
the
aroma
was
very
pleasant
with
caramel
malt
and
fruit
notes
with
a
bit
of
hop
spice
as
i
suck
some
of
this
ale
through
the
foam
the
taste
mimics
the
aroma
with
a
clean
sweet
caramel
maltiness
followed
by
a
stronger
bitterness
the
finish
is
rather
clean
with
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
perhaps
but
not
at
all
watery
the
drinkability
seems
to
be
excellent
as
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
even
at
25
ounces
a
pop
if
this
were
a
fuller
bodied
beer
it
would
be
top
notch
as
it
is
i
could
consider
this
as
a
regular
beer
its
inexpensive
attractive
and
enjoyable
for
an
everyday
beer
what
more
could
you
want
if
you
like
esb
pick
this
up
wont
be
the
best
youve
had
but
it
will
surely
please
especially
considering
the
price
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
some
more
soon
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
monday
night
football
beers
where
one
oilcan
per
half
works
out
just
about
right
pours
a
deep
amber
colour
topped
by
an
average
head
which
leaves
very
poor
lace
as
you
drink
it
aroma
consists
of
citrus
and
malt
taste
is
malty
and
bitter
finish
good
carbonation
but
still
its
another
average
fosters
beer
i
keep
some
of
these
in
my
fridge
nice
and
refreshing
good
thirst
quenching
quality
pours
with
a
nice
fluffy

over

filled
with
adjuncts
and
little

any

flavors
of
corn
and
very
light
hopping
finishes
weak
and
bland
with
a
slight
cidery

much
better
is
availiable
out
there
this
was
definitely
better
than
i
was
expecting
although
it
was
not
very
special
or
bitter
brownish
orange
with
a
very
thick
foamy
head
that
dissipated
quicker
than
i
expected

aroma

was
really
not
bitter
in
any
way
it
was
rather
mellow
with
a
malt
presence
a
little
tinny
and
thin
which
i
was
expecting
dry
lightly
fruity
finish
overall
i
think
if
they
tweaked
this
one
a
little
it
would
be
worth
another
try
but
as
it
stands
it
is
kind
of
mundane

has

this

is
not

o
nice
to
have
a
craft
beer
from
my
university
home
town
in
an
english
style
my
first
english
bitter
but
really
reminds
me
of
english
browns
overall
a
fine
english
bitter
than
isnt

dropping

is
a
very
solid
selection
especially
with
a
limited
number
of

options
final
thoughts
a

beer
and
a
good
example
of
how
much
flavor
can
be
packed
into
a
low
abv
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
o
this
beer
starts
well
on
the
nose
makes
you
look
forward
to
tasting
it
but
then
when
you
do
youre
disapointed
by
the
lack
of
flavours
bittereness
and
dry
finish
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not

very
well
balanced
not
too
bitter

you
can
taste

this
one
enjoyed
the
tall

format
i
would
drink
this
beer
more
often
if
it
was
available
in
quebec
seems
true
to
style
of
english
bitter

i
need
to
try
more

bitters

compare

it

this
was

of

pretty

for

beer
indeed
sessionable
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
bitterness
from
hops
in
my
opinion
otherwise
it
is
a
well
crafted
beer
od
ive
had
this
beer
and
enjoyed
it
before
but
its
not
really
doing
much
for
me
in
the
can
off
for
the
style
while
drinkable
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
especially
if
judging
to
style

some

the
richer
earthier

notes
on

werent
as
pronounced
on
the
palate
a

a
bit
from
some
carbonation
and
a

light
and
relatively
flavourful
im
sure
this
is
substantially
more
enjoyable
fresh
good
stuff
nonetheless
o
good
bitter
note
really
familiar
with
the
style
but
worth
looking
into
more
overall
not
a
very
exciting
beer
by
any
means
but
it
i
guess
it
work
well
as
a
session
beer
only
thing
is
i
think
it
would
be
quite
boring
to
drink
these
one
after
another
anyways
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
id
buy
again
taste
is
sweet
at
first
easily
drinkable
for
a
bitter
part
of
that
may
owe
to
the
lower
abv
as
well

it
does
say
its
intended
as
a
session
beer
and
it
seems
to
achieve

to
do
arkell
best
bitter
is
perfect
for
a
21st

beer
set
in

20th

england
it
is
a
simple
neutral
maltforward
and
cleanbrewed
ale
that
lends
itself
to
being
knocked
back
easily
and
in
large
quantities
this
is
a
beer
better
suited
to
cask
no
doubt
but
even
in

is
worth

took

a

to
find
it
finally
got
it
on

at

it

a
well
crafted
english
ale

lacking
in
the
depth

character
that
makes
this

rock
this
review
was
based
on
my

sample
out
of
a

already
had
enough
to
know
the
beer
will
make
it
into

rotation
for
social
gatherings
or
poker
games
decent
easy
to
drink

lacks

packs
a
lot
flavor
for
4
imo
a
decent
thirst
quencher
not
something
id
buy
again
though
a
nicely
drinkable
bitter
light
but
with
decent
amounts
of
malt
and
hop
an
eminently
sessionable
beer
i
must
ask
what
is
this
beer
trying
to
achieve
most
of
the
great
bitters
have
way
more
fruit
and
hop
flavours
with
some
nice
british
nuances
like
butter
and
toffee
not
so
with
wellington
arkell
i
think
the
brewer
needs
to
take
this
one
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
create
something
with
much
more
character
d
a
good
beer
for
hot
summer
day
im
a
little
bit
disappointed
due
to
the
lack
of
bitterness
maybe
not
out
of
style
but
i
prefer
my
bitter
to
be
more
bitter
overall
this
brew
seems
like
an
average
offering
from
a
great
brewery
hope
the
others
i
have
from
wellingtons
will
fair
better
than
this
final
thoughts
as
my
first
regular
english
bitter
i
was
impressed
i
mean
with
stuff
like
this
around
it
astounds
me
how
the
light
lager
is
so
popular
an
all
around
great
beer
for
all
seasons
it
would
go
well
with
dinner
or
be
good
for
a
hot
day
it
would
be
fine
at
the
pub
or
to
give
to
your
buds
at
poker
night
it
would
make
a
great
session
ale
and
is
even
good
for
cooking
with
certainly
worth
your
time
and
at
about
12
00
a
six
pack
in
ontario
this
beer
is
well
worth
every
penny
this
is
a
very
clean
refreshing
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
im
not
sure
how
it
would
fare
on
tap
or
in
a
cask
for
a
british
beer
as
it
is
very
light
and
the
taste
is
not
overly
pronounced
which
makes
me
slightly
bored
with
it
but
its
extrordinarily
easy
drinking
otherwise
on
tap
at
the
winking
judge
in
hamilton
ontario
pours
a
slight
head
with
a
dark
ambercopper
body
aroma
is
spicymalty
with
some
bitterness
as
well
taste
is
bitter
spicy
and
maybe
even
sweet
nice
bitter
aftertaste
as
well
a
really
good
light
beer
was
suprised
to
see
that
it
is
4
nice
pours
very
clear
copper
color
with
one
finger
offwhite
head
which
disappeared
quickly
smell
rye
bread
toasted
malts
slight
raisiny
aroma
very
nice
actually
taste
toastiness
comes
at
first
followed
by
bready
malty
and
fruity
raisins
plums
notes
very
well
balanced
crisp
refreshing
light
but
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
lack
flavor
very
drinkable
great
stuff
drinkability
is
55
this
is
a
session
beer
not
overly
bitter
or
good
wellington
doesnt
do
a
heck
of
a
lot
for
me
i
should
have
avoided
this
one
also
i
think
it
is
worth
noting
that
with
about
6
months
of
proper
cellaring
you
get
a
much
more
complex
fruit
forward
beer
this
isnt
something
that
i
recommend
you
hang
onto
for
that
long
but
if
you
feel
like
experimenting
its
any
interesting
brew
with
a
little
age
on
it
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
bitter
my
first
english
bitter
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
nice
to
have
a
lower
abv
quaffer
to
fall
back
on
when
desired
perfect
carbonation
for
the
style
next
to
none
mouthfeel
was
quite
thin
i
found
this
contributes
to
an
insane
drinkability
for
a
best
bitter
i
could
hammer
these
back
and
at
4
thats
a
dangerous
beer
overall
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
light
beers
that
i
have
had
to
date
its
probably
on
of
the
best
english
bitters
that
i
have
had
as
well
good
flavorfull
easy
drinking
light
beer
these
beers
make
the
domestic
macro
garbage
light
beers
look
really
really
bad
i
wish
there
were
more
light
beers
of
this
quality
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
good
mild
beer
a
casual
type
of
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
again
d
very
drinkable
a
great
bitter
on
cask
wellington
brewery
needs
to
get
this
stuff
to
the
states
taste
is
fruity
like
a
good
english
bitter
rather
mild
not
sharply
hopped
some
caramel
or
candy
sugar
notes
the
beer
is
slightly
sticky
on
my
lips
and
has
enough
bit
too
much
carbonation
i
expected
it
too
be
more
bitter
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
misleadingly
referred
to
as
a
light
beer
by
some
but
this
is
terribly
misleading
wellys
best
bitter
while
not
the
best
entry
in
the
brewerys
flagship
product
line
is
a
very
taste
brew
thats
highly
sessionable
its
an
ale
that
grows
on
you
rich
in
taste
and
low
enough
in
abv
that
you
can
have
a
few
without
feeling
guilty
once
again
wellington
demonstrates
its
position
at
the
fore
of
craft
brewing
in
ontario
i
like
this
ale
from
cask
beats
the
hell
out
of
the
rather
subdued
and
overly
carbonated
and
pasturized
bottle
version
d
very
nice
sessiontype
brew
at
4
it
wont
knock
you
on
your
ass
after
a
few
pints
either
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
to
homebrew
something
like
this
for
an
everyday
beer
d
quality
session
beer
this
poured
a
light
brown
to
a
finger
thick
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
smell
is
very
fresh
barley
malts
make
their
way
through
quite
nicely
this
stuff
tastes
pretty
good
a
modest
bitterness
with
a
clean
finish
very
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
another
excellent
brew
from
wellington
dusty
bronze
an
interestingly
canadian
beer
in
that
it
expresses
flavors
of
maple
so
strongly
that
other
malt
and
hop
flavors
are
simply
forgotten
recurrent
themes
of
stark
bitterness
that
seem
sour
and
out
of
place
mingling
with
that
ubiquitous
mapleleaf
flavor
dusty
almost
leathery
hints
as
well
went
down
fairly
well
but
seemed
hamhanded
in
use
of
maple
relatively
fat
mouthfeel
for
such
a
smallish
beer
poured
a
clear
light
brown
fresh
from
the
cask
at
bow
and
arrow
small
head
formed
no
lace
the
smell
was
almost
non
existant
little
bit
of
malt
and
hops
taste
is
subdued
as
well
some
sweet
maltiness
is
present
grapefruity
little
bitterness
it
was
smooth
but
very
light
and
watery
kind
of
alright
but
disappointing
couldnt
find
the
burst
of
flavour
the
rest
of
the
reviews
seem
to
reflect
overall
too
thin
and
watery
for
me
to
consider
a
real
good
drinking
beer
inspite
of
a
slight
pleasant
fruitiness
cask
poured
a
clear
brown
color
ale
with
a
small
head
that
disappeared
quite
fast
aroma
is
quite
weak
with
some
malt
being
distinguishable
with
some
light
hops
taste
is
refreshing
but
very
light
with
some
sweet
malt
and
light
hops
body
is
too
thin
for
my
own
liking
and
was
expecting
more
bitterness
not
bad
but
there
is
some
way
better
bitter
out
there
pours
a
vibrant
amberorange
with
a
tan
head
and
impressive
lacing
appearance
reminds
me
of
a
west
coast
american
style
pale
ale
very
light
and
flavourful
bitter
tonnes
of
hop
aroma
and
flavour
also
a
light
fruitiness
pine
nuts
floral
one
of
my
favourites
from
wellington
a
great
session
beer
just
a
note
the
freshness
of
casks
at
cest
what
can
be
inconsistent
so
some
samples
arent
as
good
as
others
this
review
was
based
on
a
cask
that
was
tapped
only
a
few
hours
earlier
ive
had
other
samples
that
tasted
overwhelmingly
of
sour
milk
poured
a
coppery
burnt
orange
with
a
white
head
that
dissipated
relatively
quickly
smell
well
rather
floral
and
nutty
with
a
touch
of
citrus
taste
was
some
malts
and
quite
hoppy
for
an
ale
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
nice
dry
finish
bitters
are
known
for
there
drinkability
and
this
is
no
exception
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
i
probably
will
the
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
aromas
with
an
excellent
citrus
hop
taste
up
front
and
a
more
subdued
yet
lovely
french
breadlike
maltiness
in
the
middle
the
finish
of
this
ale
on
cask
is
much
more
crisp
and
dry
making
for
a
much
more
refreshing
tipple
wow
another
winner
from
wellington
a
damn
good
ordinary
bitter
in
the
cask
conditioned
format
sure
this
beer
is
still
damn
good
on
tap
but
it
really
shines
on
cask
another
worldclass
uk
style
beer
is
being
brewed
in
ontario
light
body
very
well
balanced
beer
the
start
has
more
malty
sweetness
and
then
the
hops
come
out
almost
no
aftertaste
if
anything
just
a
lingering
sweetness
clear
rich
copper
with
a
thin
but
long
lasting
head
that
producing
some
fine
lacing
this
beer
has
a
very
clean
mild
aroma
with
wellbalanced
hops
and
carameltoasted
malts
malty
flavour
to
start
and
hop
bitterness
becomes
more
apparent
towards
the
finish
mediumlight
body
and
low
carbonation
helps
keep
it
smooth
the
finish
is
dry
with
hops
lingering
on
the
palate
great
session
beer
pretty
good
mild
bitter
appearance
is
kind
of
a
dull
sunset
colour
browns
twingling
with
oranges
a
1
12
finger
head
that
slowly
settles
to
one
finger
at
the
finish
small
strings
of
lace
coat
the
glass
smells
of
caramel
barley
hops
applesrusset
and
ripe
raspberries
tastes
a
bit
more
bitter
than
the
smell
leads
to
believe
the
malts
are
first
with
the
hops
a
close
contender
their
is
also
a
bit
of
toffee
taste
pleasantly
balancing
the
apples
leave
a
somewhat
sour
aftertaste
definite
granny
smith
but
i
still
think
their
are
some
russets
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
a
little
chewy
and
light
i
would
like
to
know
what
itd
be
like
with
more
body
one
of
those
circumstances
where
more
body
could
be
an
improvement
or
fatal
very
drinkable
the
light
body
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
while
the
complex
balances
of
taste
and
aromas
leaves
you
curious
for
more
a
good
nay
a
terrific
beer
from
wellington
its
nice
to
know
their
is
a
brewery
in
ontario
that
produces
some
quality
beer
another
gem
from
the
wellington
county
brewery
beer
must
be
consumed
at
room
temperature
to
appreciate
its
essence
the
terra
cotta
colour
was
quite
intriguing
for
a
bitter
the
head
lingered
a
tad
too
long
but
once
it
subsided
the
plethora
of
hops
came
to
the
fore
i
really
enjoyed
the
chewy
taste
and
the
light
smooth
feel
in
swallowing
no
apparent
after
taste
not
the
best
bitter
i
have
every
had
but
not
a
bad
bitter
either
say
that
5
times
also
tried
on
cask
and
not
as
tasty
had
on
cask
again
3
years
later
and
there
is
a
funky
taste
to
it
very
nice
deep
golden
hue
light
and
shortlived
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
smell
is
fairly
typical
a
little
hoppy
a
little
sweet
taste
is
solid
well
hopped
and
with
a
dryish
bitter
finish
feels
light
but
substantial
kind
of
an
oxymoron
but
im
sure
most
people
know
the
feeling
certainly
a
fine
and
solid
brew
that
i
may
come
back
to
when
i
want
a
session
drinker
overall
i
like
a
fair
amount
of
gearys
product
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
if
i
want
a
gearys
beer
in
the
winter
ill
reach
for
their
porter
042314
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
not
sure
whats
up
here
normally
i
favor
winter
brews
but
this
has
me
wondering
theres
a
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
that
im
attributing
to
an
over
spicyness
just
as
too
much
cinnamon
doesnt
taste
good
without
the
right
amount
of
sugar
so
too
the
spices
here
are
unbridled
all
that
malt
spice
wno
sugar
creates
a
bitter
aftertaste
thats
off
putting
o
im
really
enjoying
this
it
has
a
nice
kick
for
a
winter
time
english
ipa
and
drinks
very
easily
at
7
99
for
a
6pack
this
is
a
solid
deal
too
another
option
for
those
who
dont
enjoy
the
spiced
winter
warmers
and
want
something
different
o
this
beer
tastes
very
malty
even
when
considering
it
is
an
english
ipa
and
not
an
american
ipa
but
this
lends
some
more
body
to
the
mouthfeel
making
it
a
nice
ipa
for
the
winter
nothing
to
separate
this
from
the
pack
of
other
winter
brews
out
there
but
enjoy
it
if
someone
offers
you
one
pours
a
moderate
amberbrown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
and
some
light
lacing
the
nose
carries
some
caramel
and
a
bit
of
toffee
some
bready
malt
in
the
background
light
vanilla
not
sure
this
was
much
of
an
eipa
either
way
i
appreciated
the
light
malt
character
throughout
almost
like
a
barleywinelight
maybe
a
faded
bottle
already
either
way
fairly
enjoyable
caramel
and
bread
through
the
flavor
medium
body
with
a
pleasant
chewiness
not
fantastic
or
out
of
the
ordinary
but
a
wellmade
brew
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
look
amber
color
the
head
was
an
off
white
color
with
a
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
hoppy
with
some
sweet
malt
aromas
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
sweet
up
front
with
some
basic
caramel
flavors
that
were
followed
up
by
a
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
had
a
nice
crisp
bite
to
it
overall
its
more
of
just
a
regular
ipa
than
a
winter
ale
in
my
opinion
but
still
not
a
bad
brew
o
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
an
english
ipa
but
i
like
it
for
the
most
part
probably
come
back
to
it
the
beer
still
has
a
nice
coppery
appearance
in
the
glass
with
a
thick
full
head
the
drinking
texture
is
also
very
good
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
beyond
that
i
found
the
taste
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
preference
though
if
you
are
a
fan
of
that
kind
of
taste
i
think
you
will
like
this
beer
that
is
if
they
are
still
selling
it
it
may
be
out
of
season
by
now
i
am
not
against
a
vanillaflavored
winter
ale
though
its
not
my
favorite
style
in
general
i
have
had
some
i
quite
enjoy
this
beer
however
was
so
strong
in
the
vanilla
that
it
tasted
like
the
brewer
dumped
a
ton
of
imitation
vanilla
extract
into
each
bottle
and
for
the
first
time
ever
i
could
not
even
finish
the
beer
in
my
glass
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
light
but
medium
in
body
and
goes
down
easy
enough
with
a
nice
light
aftertaste
this
beer
would
be
interesting
pair
with
some
some
with
maple
syrup
or
a
well
buttered
pancake
overall
its
not
what
i
would
call
an
ipa
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
its
tasty
not
too
strong
and
readily
available
this
time
of
year
this
is
more
enjoyable
than
expected
i
might
actually
get
this
when
im
out
on
the
town
some
time
drinkability
a
good
beer
overall
and
one
of
the
more
unique
ipas
i
have
had
i
would
enjoy
having
this
beer
again
but
it
doesnt
really
seem
suited
for
winter
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
the
style
and
a
worth
a
try
at
least
this
is
a
unique
and
very
nice
warmer
it
breaks
from
tradition
with
a
whole
different
kind
of
flavor
this
has
a
very
smooth
creamy
maplegingerbread
taste
its
like
a
warm
serving
of
liquid
waffles
its
certainly
not
going
to
be
a
beer
for
everyone
but
i
like
it
smooth
creamy
and
not
too
overly
sweet
however
it
is
odd
for
this
style
and
somewhat
confusing
it
tastes
more
like
a
cream
ale
but
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
anytime
pretty
damn
drinkable
and
a
damn
decent
take
on
the
style
nice
choice
of
a
winter
ale
imo
md
decent
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
but
not
much
flavor
to
speak
of
ill
have
to
try
this
again
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
just
a
bad
bottle
d
just
okay
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
pale
copper
with
light
amounts
of
carbonation
noticeable
very
thin
head
with
a
bubbly
white
collar
that
leaves
sparse
amounts
of
lace
nice
aroma
fresh
yeastiness
buttery
attributes
some
hop
notes
too
base
is
a
lot
of
malt
and
a
lot
of
yeast
toffeish
and
buttery
hops
are
minimal
though
there
is
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
full
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
decent
enough
thats
about
it
doesnt
compare
to
summits
english
style
ipa
if
you
looking
for
a
dark
beer
with
christmas
spices
this
is
not
your
beer
its
a
traditional
english
style
ale
the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
slight
citrus
background
it
has
a
golden
amber
color
and
a
nice
white
head
the
beer
starts
with
a
sweet
malt
and
with
a
slightly
harsh
carbonation
that
brings
out
the
earth
hop
flavor
the
hop
flavor
is
more
of
a
pale
ale
flavor
but
the
buttery
malt
makes
is
a
real
english
style
what
i
love
about
this
beer
is
its
not
traditional
gearys
is
smart
why
try
and
make
another
dark
ale
as
the
hsa
and
porter
are
some
of
the
best
beers
ever
created
its
fine
and
different
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
gearys
winter
pours
a
hazy
light
copper
with
a
thin
but
nice
head
the
aroma
is
buttery
with
some
grassy
earthy
maybe
slightly
sour
bitterness
the
flavor
is
some
pale
malt
up
front
with
some
toffee
but
not
sweet
the
diacetyl
comes
through
quickly
and
overwhelms
the
the
herbal
and
grassy
hops
the
is
a
solid
bitterness
but
it
seems
to
lack
balance
because
of
the
buttery
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
there
is
a
slightly
unpleasant
aftertaste
mediumtobig
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
that
makes
this
beer
feel
smooth
and
quaffable
definitely
not
gearys
best
but
a
solid
enough
beer
that
ive
bought
the
winter
variety
12pack
twice
this
year
not
much
of
an
ipa
even
by
english
standards
but
a
big
buttery
balanced
pale
in
its
own
right
this
beer
will
only
go
as
far
ones
love
for
ringwood
this
is
the
january
craft
bottle
of
the
month
at
west
on
centre
in
wr
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
nice
orange
color
slightly
opaque
decent
sized
head
not
as
dark
as
i
was
expecting
for
a
winter
ale
definite
hop
aroma
nice
warming
hop
flavor
with
a
good
mouthfeel
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
would
have
expected
again
for
a
winter
ale
this
beer
was
a
nice
ipa
but
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
when
i
ordered
it
d
this
beer
isnt
that
good
i
wouldnt
buy
one
again
aside
from
the
pale
ale
ive
never
really
had
a
good
gearys
experience
cheers
the
style
classification
is
somewhat
bewildering
seems
more
akin
to
pale
not
enough
hop
presence
d
a
subdued
tasty
ale
that
wont
win
any
awards
but
is
a
solid
offering
overall
id
say
not
bad
pours
a
clear
ambergolden
colour
very
thick
white
head
forms
drops
some
lace
rings
and
settles
to
a
thin
layer
looks
alright

is
okay
toasty
malt
some
grain
and
biscuit
floral
quite
fruity
lightly
bit
of
spiciness
oat
not
much

though
taste
is
similar
sweet
and
toasty
at
first
some
honey
oats
and
biscuit
floral
light
fruitiness
lightly
musty
balanced
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
just
lacks
anything
flavourful
or
complex
pretty
boring
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
thanks
kyle
pours
a
slightly
fogged
dull
gold
nose
is
sweet
malts
slight
leafy
thing
flavor
is
nutty
and
leafy
its
sweet
a
bit
but
theres
a
bitter
and
acrid
edge
i
dont
like
feel
is
sticky
and
thick
on
the
liquid
and
the
carbonation
this
is
decent
nothing
overly
interesting
but
this
might
be
interesting
on
cask
a
light
sparkling
golden
amber
colored
ale
with
a
fair
white
head
and
nominal
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
pleasantly
spicey
wheat
and
clove
the
flavor
suggests
tangy
citrus
hops
and
allspice
apple
theres
a
warm
maltiness
noted
as
you
go
but
overall
its
fairly
dry
and
tingly
good
drinkability
very
likeable
and
worth
a
try
a
winter
brew
that
is
lively
but
not
heavily
alcoholed
if
this
is
indeed
aiming
for
an
english
ipa
and
not
american
its
not
so
bad
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
23
pints
of
this
although
it
is
not
as
dark
or
complex
as
i
would
expect
from
a
winter
ale
grabbed
a
six
pack
while
traveling
through
la
me
out
of
the
bottle
this
one
was
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
retention
was
average
the
lacing
substandard
the
aroma
was
slightly
musty
and
macrolager
like
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
flavors
were
ok
but
really
quite
bland
standard
malt
hints
of
spices
and
generic
hops
nothing
offensive
but
totally
unimpressive
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
slightly
prickly
and
the
carbonation
medium
to
high
for
a
craft
beer
i
though
it
was
pretty
crappy
and
a
shame
to
have
to
drink
six
if
i
drank
this
out
of
a
bottle
in
the
heat
of
summer
and
it
were
called
a
summer
ale
i
wouldnt
complain
but
thats
not
the
case
and
im
complaining
adequate
mouthfeel
with
very
little
flavor
in
the
initial
hit
on
the
tongue
turns
bitter
but
in
a
stale
kind
of
way
finishes
better
than
it
starts
as
the
hops
finally
kick
in
the
finish
combines
the
ipa
kick
with
a
winter
warmer
glow
a
strange
combination
indeed
the
taste
is
a
touch
biting
some
leafy
hop
but
it
seems
to
be
faded
there
is
a
decent
and
full
palate
of
malts
to
this
beer
some
earthy
some
a
bit
musty
some
bready
qualities
perhaps
but
the
acerbic
bite
the
yeastiness
and
buttery
flavors
diminish
the
maltiness
of
the
beer
the
bittering
hop
lasts
too
long
into
the
finish
and
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
im
not
good
with
calling
this
a
winter
ale
but
even
as
an
english
ipa
this
isnt
the
best
one
youll
find
for
sure
its
okay
nothing
great
gave
it
a
shot
but
not
the
best
i
wouldnt
refuse
if
offered
and
not
the
worst
example
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
has
a
decent
appearance
smells
malty
to
me
little
hop
scent
the
taste
is
where
it
all
went
wrong
the
beer
starts
off
slightly
sweet
but
finishes
watery
mouthfeel
is
also
thin
and
watery
overall
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
brew
its
lacking
in
hoppiness
and
is
watery
tasting
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
dissapointing
for
an
ipa
i
would
not
buy
it
again
intense
hop
floral
finish
not
really
actually
i
wasnt
completely
sure
this
was
considered
an
ipa
pours
a
darker
golden
color
mediumbodied
and
a
pretty
good
amount
of
head
on
top
a
little
more
malty
than
hoppy
in
the
aroma
some
hops
with
a
sweet
malty
taste
and
doesnt
have
an
agressive
hop
bite
id
like
in
an
ipa
decent
beer
though
d
sorry
a
very
bland
drinking
beer
and
would
have
to
pass
on
this
one
you
could
safely
draino
the
remainder
of
the
beer
and
not
feel
the
least
bit
guilty
drinkability
soso
it
was
a
bit
bland
pours
a
dark
golden
decent
head
and
lacing
for
an
ipa
id
have
to
agree
that
there
isnt
that
in
your
face
kind
of
aroma
subtle
citrus
and
slight
spice
tastes
like
all
the
ingredients
are
there
but
everything
needs
to
be
turned
up
subtle
is
the
name
of
the
game
here
subtle
citrus
subtle
pepper
spice
slight
alcohol
taste
very
sessionable
but
not
satisfying
as
a
winter
beer
not
recommended
i
actually
did
not
read
about
this
beer
before
opening
it
and
was
surprised
to
not
find
a
winter
warmer
of
some
sort
nevertheless
it
is
a
pleasant
well
balanced
example
of
a
british
ipa
my
favorite
type
of
ipa
not
spectacular
by
any
means
but
quite
nice
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
yellow
with
a
tall
medium
bodied
offwhite
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
some
it
smells
of
nice
tasted
malts
some
hoppy
bitterness
and
some
spices
the
taste
is
pretty
good
with
a
nice
toasted
malty
backbone
underneath
some
wintry
spices
some
nutmeg
and
some
citrisy
flavors
are
layered
over
the
malt
and
a
citrisy
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
it
has
a
smooth
but
dull
feel
that
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
and
maybe
a
crisper
feel
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
it
was
not
what
i
would
want
in
an
english
ipa
i
dont
recall
it
being
bitter
but
every
sip
left
me
with
a
bitter
face
as
if
my
body
was
anticipating
something
that
wasnt
there
i
think
it
was
the
fact
that
the
feel
was
not
quite
crisp
but
not
leaving
much
of
an
aftertaste
either
im
just
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
it
wasnt
really
a
problem
to
drink
it
but
i
just
dont
see
myself
getting
more
this
one
poured
a
clear
bright
orange
with
a
thin
offwhite
cap
that
fell
quickly
to
a
ring
there
was
a
bit
of
fine
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
was
fruity
herbal
grassy
and
a
little
toasty
medium
bitterness
with
some
fruit
and
malt
up
front
it
finished
a
little
spicy
nearly
peppery
with
lingering
herbalgrassy
notes
and
slight
warmth
medium
to
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
a
little
on
the
dry
side
fairly
well
balanced
with
the
hops
coming
on
a
little
strong
for
an
english
ipa
pretty
drinkable
stuff
theres
not
one
single
bad
thing
here
unfortunately
theres
nowhere
near
enough
of
whats
good
either
flesh
it
out
and
it
would
likely
be
a
fuller
and
interesting
twist
on
a
winter
seasonal
instead
it
comes
off
as
an
unremarkable
if
decently
drinkable
session
soldier
maybe
im
overstating
it
a
bit
but
it
seems
theres
just
no
there
there
i
guess
the
best
way
to
describe
this
one
is
acerbic
its
overly
harsh
in
its
bitterness
considering
there
is
no
flavor
to
back
it
up
not
recommended
overall
tasty
and
enjoyable
but
wont
be
that
memorable
try
it
if
you
see
it
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
drinkability
this
ipa
is
certainly
different
than
most
winter
seasonals
it
is
fairly
drinkable
but
really
lacking
in
hops
to
be
a
good
ipa
an
easy
to
find

i

it
was

this
easily
ranks
as
one

the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
the
displeasure
of
imbibing
even
most
macro
lagers
come
over
better
virtually
tasteless
and
without
aroma
what
little
can
be
detected
is
horrid
while
the
body
leaves
much
to
be
desired
like
a
corpse
this
is
bad
on
so
many
levels
it
should
be
considered
a
crime
against
humanity
avoid
at
all
costs
cost
me
a
pound
at
a
works
beer
call
managed
to
drink
it
all
but
would
have
trouble
spending
that
much
on
such
a
brew
again
i
had
never
had
this
beer
so
i
decided
to
try
it
as
it
was
on
tap
at
my
uni
bar
it
said
bitter
on
the
label
but
i
wasnt
prepared
for
exactly
how
bitter
the
beer
would
be
the
beer
was
very
thick
but
at
the
same
time
watery
i
can
see
why
people
have
seen
this
beer
as
going
downhill
everyone
around
me
was
dismissing
it
as
complete
shit
but
i
thought
it
held
its
own
it
was
certainly
different
than
anything
i
have
ever
tried
and
i
wasnt
prepared
for
it
was
it
a
little
too
bitter
and
watery
yea
but
i
think
this
beer
has
more
potential
than
people
give
it
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
it
back
in
its
prime
as
people
have
said
but
for
now
it
is
an
interesting
style
that
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
more
never
again
this
is
not
a
traditional
bitter
its
one
of
those
nasty
nitrotap
things
that
makes
it
look
like
bitter
but
it
has
not
flavout
feels
like
water
and
is
so
cold
that
its
just
an
ordeal
to
drink
i
warn
others
not
to
try
this
abomination
drinkability
ummm
no
i
cant
have
again
shame
that
a
beer
which
looks
so
nice
at
first
turns
out
to
be
a
let
down
in
all
other
categories
oh
well
i
had
tried
boddingtons
pub
ale
when
i
lived
in
the
states
and
highly
enjoyed
that
bought
the
draught
bitter
after
moving
to
the
uk
this
has
a
mellow
creamy
taste
that
is
hard
not
to
enjoy
nice
creamy
head
that
remains
its
amazing
that
beer
from
a
can
can
taste
this
good
only
minor
downside
is
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
too
mellow
the
beer
tastes
great
on
the
tongue
but
the
finish
is
almost
watery
otherwise
a
great
beer
d
this
is
an
okay
brew
very
mild
but
quite
drinkable
d
bland
poor
mass
produced
bitter
pass
the
flavor
was
not
as
heavy
as
i
expected
but
it
is
smooth
with
the
kind
of
hoppy
bitterness
i
expect
from
a
good
english
ale
it
is
smooth
and
pleasant
and
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
meal
it
tastes
bland
in
the
extreme
vaguely
bitter
but
with
no
points
of
interest
to
speak
of
at
all
this
is
really
one
of
the
worst
examples
of
a
nitro
can
that
ive
tried
they
are
normally
pretty
good
like
beamish
stout
kilkenny
guinness
this
one
is
bland
its
bigger
brother
pub
ale
is
a
lot
better
overall
not
too
bad
ive
tasted
worse
very
refreshing
and
light
it
was
much
better
off
of
cask
than
on
tap
as
well
md
heavy
in
the
mouth
but
light
for
what
i
believe
the
style
is
not
bad
but
really
reminds
me
of
a
guinness
clone
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
isnt
much
too
it
its
just
a
bit
bland
this
beer
poured
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
that
was
clear
and
fairly
carbonated
the
head
that
was
produced
was
rather
weak
it
was
off
white
in
color
and
even
with
the
nitro
can
the
head
only
lasted
a
moment
before
it
fell
to
nothing
not
even
a
ring
on
the
edges
there
was
no
lace
present
the
aroma
that
came
from
the
glass
was
on
the
weak
side
as
well
aromas
of
light
sweet
malt
some
floral
hops
and
fruit
were
all
that
i
could
detect
the
tastes
that
rolled
over
my
tongue
were
much
like
the
nose
weak
i
tasted
in
the
beginning
a
sweet
malt
and
fruit
maybe
a
strawberry
and
ended
on
the
slight
bitter
side
with
floral
hops
the
aftertaste
was
faint
some
bitter
hops
came
through
but
were
not
lasting
the
body
was
light
over
all
a
light
beer
with
decent
flavors
even
though
the
flavors
were
weak
they
were
refreshing
on
the
cruise
in
the
hot
sun
this
beer
is
a
decent
session
beer
when
in
the
hot
sun
and
you
dont
want
anything
heavy
but
want
a
beer
overall
a
non
impressive
ale
but
not
a
bad
one
hops
are
present
but
without
a
long
aftertaste
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
small
drinking
glass
tasted
on
612013
in
huntly
scotland
o
disregarding
the
slightly
metallic
finish
the
beer
has
creaminess
than
other
mass
produced
english
bitters
commonly
lack
also
the
hint
of
dark
fruits
is
a
nice
addition
this
was
quite
bland
drinkable
but
not
entirely
enjoyable
read
that
the
cask
version
rocks
but
this
was
really
quite
meh
overall
one
of
the
better
english
bitters
i
much
prefer
them
full
strength
like
this
rather
than
the
milds
a
good
dose
of
sweet
malts
and
some
floral
hops
make
this
an
easydrinking
beer
the
price
is
reasonable
for
an
english
bitter
too
worth
it
pours
somewhere
between
copper
and
brick
red
coloured
with
a
decent
slightly
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
lemony
with
a
hint
of
dried
fruit
pleasant
but
not
bold
this
seems
surprisingly
malty
for
a
bitter
with
a
sweet
start
and
then
a
biscuity
taste
to
the
fore
any
bitterness
which
follows
is
moderate
the
hop
impact
is
more
metallic
giving
way
to
a
slight
herbalmint
aftertaste
than
bitter
the
taste
didnt
quite
pan
out
as
i
had
imagined
from
the
nose
yet
pleasant
but
not
bold
certainly
reflects
my
attitude
towards
this
beer
o
earth
didnt
move
a
bit
like
a
watered
down
uninteresting
dubbel
o
decent
esb
but
rather
mundane
a
bit
sweet
for
more
than
one
md
lively
texture
throughout
along
with
the
flavour
its
a
bit
like
gintonic
a
bit
thinbodied
in
the
end
though
overall
a
lightmedium
bodied
bitter
with
good
fruity
elements
to
enjoy
this
is
an
easytodrink
session
bitter
though
not
as
mellow
nor
tasty
as
the
caskconditioned
version
when
in
good
form
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
one
it
was
a
nice
beer
but
it
came
across
a
lot
lighter
than
i
would
have
imagined
the
beer
was
very
lively
and
there
was
quite
a
sweet
taste
overall
that
i
imagine
would
get
quite
sickening
after
a
while
but
since
i
only
had
the
one
it
wasnt
a
problem
a
lot
better
english
bitters
around
even
in
bc
malts
lead
the
way
in
the
taste
too
with
the
hops
and
yeast
coming
along
nicely
in
the
background
fruity
biscuits
lightly
baked
with
a
finish
of
mildly
bittering
hops
easy
to
drink
and
a
standard
best
bitter
never
been
a
favourite
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
overall
not
the
best
and
lets
face
it
its
a
crowded
market
for
bottled
bitter
well
it
is
in
a
can
which
made
is
fairly
fresh
tasting
which
can
be
an
issue
for
uk
beers
in
bc
cheap
at
2
10
a
tall
can
which
makes
it
good
value
as
it
is
a
decent
bitter
that
has
a
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
caramellike
note
in
the
taste
not
sure
why
they
had
to
add
sugar
but
it
is
a
beer
i
will
go
back
to
as
it
has
that
english
hop
nose
backed
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
the
sugar
lends
a
thicker
than
expected
body
to
this
and
the
carbonation
is
really
mild
drinkable
almost
sessionable
but
a
bit
heavy
handed
o
just
past
it
best
before
date
so
was
a
cheapie
i
couldnt
pass
up
wasnt
a
big
fan
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
as
the
glass
emptied
i
couldnt
have
more
than
two
overall
overall
this
is
a
rich
hearty
beer
with
spice
and
depth
in
flavour
not
good
to
quench
thirst
but
would
be
more
of
a
cold
winter
drink
od
pour
showing
weak
in
most
respects
not
interesting
or
overly
tasty
ill
pass
if
this
comes
by
again
dthis
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
crave
a
cask
bitter
poured
clear
dark
copper
beer
with
excellent
offwhite
head
leaving
some
nice
laces
aroma
isnt
zesty
grassy
hops
and
malt
to
be
easily
contradistinguished
moderate
malt
body
with
plain
bitter
finish
i
have
felt
elusive
apricot
or
peach
note
right
before
hops
the
beer
is
crisp
but
faceless
im
slightly
disappointed
sorry
for
my
english
this
is
my
first
review
i
hope
its
not
my
last
carbonation
is
high
the
body
seems
watery
malty
and
hoppy
aftertaste
earthy
musky
d
excellent
session
better
with
a
solid
flavour
profile
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
english
bitter
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
would
be
one
of
my
top
choices
to
have
a
few
pints
of
with
friends
at
the
pub
i
used
to
be
very
fond
of
this
on
draught
when
younger
imagining
i
would
one
day
be
a
director
myself
i
did
get
to
live
that
dream
but
it
turend
into
a
nightmare
beer
is
a
more
reliable
friend
vibrant
bronze
with
a
tight
little
head
some
good
lacing
going
on
here
spicy
hop
notes
gel
in
with
the
honeyed
malt
delivers
on
the
palate
with
some
robust
bitterness
and
a
long
nutty
aftertaste
very
satisfying
carbonation
is
perfect
fills
the
mouth
with
plenty
of
flavour
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
high
drinkability
on
this
one
a
very
nice
beer
only
let
down
by
the
awol
aroma
d
nice
drop
good
for
a
session
a
very
drinkable
beer
perhaps
a
tad
heavy
on
the
sweetness
but
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
a
lovely
drop
a
decent
drop
quite
drinkable
and
with
things
to
like
better
than
the
keg
version
the
overall
effect
left
me
pleased
enough
to
delay
plans
to
move
on
and
i
sampled
another
the
medium
body
does
tend
to
lean
towards
the
lighter
side
but
this
did
make
it
incredibly
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
night
in
glasgow
drinkability
easy
drinker
but
the
more
harsh
bitter
character
and
higher
abv
make
it
less
suitable
for
a
true
session
have
to
admit
although
decent
alcohol
level
in
the
bottle
form
and
in
its
current
brewing
it
does
not
excite
fairly
runofthemill
bitter
with
moderate
head
after
pouring
some
malty
hoppy
components
its
not
awful
but
its
not
really
interesting
either
plenty
of
others
to
choose
from
beer
poured
a
golden
orange
with
an
ok
head
initially
that
floated
as
the
pint
was
drank
nose
was
a
hint
of
malts
and
not
much
else
this
brew
was
served
fairly
close
to
room
tempature
and
it
had
a
blast
of
bittering
hops
with
a
semi
skunky
finish
dont
know
if
it
was
because
it
was
at
a
higher
temp
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
drinkability
was
ok
but
would
have
been
better
if
colder
i
enjoy
dark
beers
warmer
but
pales
and
bitters
are
not
as
good
at
room
temps
bham
uk
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
really
good
on
this
beer
and
the
snappy
bitterness
is
great
pumps
an
amber
color
with
no
head
the
smell
is
slightly
malty
with
sweetness
to
it
and
a
hint
of
citrus
although
nothing
too
noticeable
the
taste
is
very
surprising
for
a
cask
conditioned
ale
usually
i
find
them
bland
and
not
special
it
retains
the
sweetness
through
the
first
sips
like
molasses
with
sugar
the
aftertaste
is
great
it
stays
sweet
on
the
tongue
but
you
get
hops
that
stay
in
the
throat
much
better
than
most
ales
other
its
ok
but
it
doesnt
really
merit
the
cute
story
on
the
label
about
how
this
was
originally
brewed
only
for
the
directors
of
the
brewery
and
they
were
finally
convinced
to
make
it
publicly
available
i
wouldnt
miss
it
drink
up
arthur
the
worlds
about
to
end
740
drinkability
is
too
sweet
just
not
that
enjoyable
little
bit
above
average
poured
a
dark
copper
from
the
can
with
light
carbonation
this
resulted
in
a
thin
but
dense
and
creamy
head
that
lasted
through
most
of
the
beer
and
formed
this
lace
on
the
glass
slightly
sharp
crisp
hop
aroma
with
grass
and
earth
notes
light
on
malt
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
ripe
fruit
starts
with
a
light
bitterness
that
grows
through
the
end
giving
it
a
clean
finish
overall
the
flavours
quite
mild
assisted
by
the
low
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
average
to
decent
english
bitter
beer
there
are
whole
swathes
of
northern
england
where
its
the
only
decent
caskconditioned
beer
available
at
all
at
4
8
its
not
really
a
lunchtime
drink
but
it
certainly
slips
down
dangerously
easily
its
nicely
balanced
and
refreshing
with
a
clean
appearance
and
a
light
hoppy
aroma
reccommended
this
beer
continually
begs
the
question
dont
the
brewers
at
courage
like
the
directors
if
this
is
the
best
they
can
come
up
with
for
them
perhaps
they
should
look
for
another
career
this
is
the
type
of
beer
id
expect
as
the
standard
beer
in
the
range
not
the
top
shelf
stuff
great
with
a
ploughmans
i
lucked
in
as
this
is
currently
on
sale
at
my
local
liquor
store
this
bitter
poured
out
a
dark
amber
colour
with
a
very
serious
head
not
big
it
just
looks
good
the
nose
is
typically
of
a
bitter
but
light
on
the
bitter
taste
it
has
a
fruity
taste
with
a
touch
of
hops
not
bad
for
an
sn
brew
a
pleasant
surprise
half
way
through
i
added
old
chedder
to
the
mix
it
went
well
together
think
ill
take
advantage
of
the
sale
and
lay
a
few
in
stock
this
is
one
of
the
first
bitter
that
i
drank
pourred
an
amber
brew
with
a
nice
foamy
head
on
top
of
it
taste
is
bitter
would
have
expected
more
bitterness
and
a
little
bit
fruity
no
spice
are
overly
detectable
would
be
curious
to
try
some
more
bitter
would
drink
this
again
pours
with
a
serious
white
head
that
stays
leaving
sheets
of
lace
medium
carbonation
nice
clear
amber
color
nose
is
malty
label
has
this
as
a
classic
strong
english
ale
and
the
label
does
not
have
the
word
bitter
on
it
the
abv
is
still
4
8
if
this
is
a
bitter
it
is
the
maltiest
sweetest
i
have
ever
had
but
it
does
finish
ever
so
slightly
bitter
the
cock
is
crowing
on
the
label
and
brewery
is
in
staines
england
thats
just
west
of
london
i
really
like
this
beer
its
a
very
nice
buttery
fruity
toffee
bitter
the
taste
starts
moderately
sweet
and
remains
throught
the
finish
then
mildly
lingers
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
bitter
since
i
cant
remember
having
one
just
knew
that
its
not
supposed
to
be
bitter
so
i
gave
it
a
try
when
i
saw
it
has
a
pleasant
light
red
colour
like
a
weak
tea
with
very
little
head
a
mild
grapefruit
aroma
and
sour
fruity
taste
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
but
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
have
one
if
you
put
it
in
front
of
me
but
not
especially
impressive
had
this
beer
reluctantly
on
my
most
recent
trip
to
london
when
what
i
really
wanted
was
tapped
out
this
ale
surprised
me
a
bit
color
was
a
deep
copper
with
a
nice
head
retention
lacing
of
my
pint
glass
was
copious
aroma
was
a
little
weak
and
mostly
of
malt
taste
was
smooth
and
malty
with
subtle
hopping
i
didnt
think
it
was
too
bad
considering
it
comes
from
one
of
the
villianous
big
boys
of
british
brewing
decently
drinkable
very
much
a
sipping
ale
directors
is
a
smooth
end
to
a
hectic
day
like
the
regular
best
this
is
very
bland
smooth
sweet
palate
very
very
simple
and
boring
im
sorry
i
really
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
one
one
dimentional
also
had
a
slight
offfruit
character
a
world
classic
one
of
the
ten
or
fifteen
best
bitters
in
the
world
500
ml
bottle
golden
orange
colour
with
a
white
head
that
fades
soon
but
leaves
a
good
lace
smell
of
hops
and
citrus
mineral
limestone
sme
rough
edges
in
the
buttery
palate
but
it
feels
very
good
and
refreshing
taste
of
citrus
hops
and
minerals
good
one
this
is
just
one
of
the
beers
that
is
perfect
to
have
at
the
pub
with
the
mates
as
it
doesnt
ask
for
too
much
attention
and
slakes
the
thirst
just
fine
without
boring
the
palate
or
mind
o
very
drinkable
as
a
english
bitter
should
be
nice
one
o
it
wont
blow
your
socks
off
but
i
suppose
ebs
arent
really
supposed
to
hit
too
hard
pleasant
beer
for
a
quiet
chat
at
the
pub
dont
think
it
has
travelled
well
but
still
within
bb
this
is
a
nice
enough
beer
and
good
for
a
session
d
an
average
bitter
good
but
not
special
the
execution
is
brilliant
its
high
on
flavor
and
relatively
low
on
alcohol
i
really
like
these
aspects
and
think
this
makes
for
a
perfect
session
beer
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
had
lately
i
am
sure
i
will
make
some
effort
to
find
the
version
in
the
cask
probably
lacking
the
character
it
once
had
but
certainly
more
consistent
still
a
pretty
good
ordinary
bitter
which
remains
a
classic
session
beer
nearly
didnt
review
this
its
well
with
the
bottle
date
but
i
just
dont
think
this
beer
travels
well
check
out
the
other
bottle
reviews
from
australia
and
they
are
all
well
below
the
average
its
probably
great
from
the
cask
but
avoid
the
bottle
the
definition
of
a
cask
bitter
for
me
overall
a
nice
refreshing
session
ale
tasted
more
like
a
summer
ale
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
respectable
as
well
abv
is
slightly
higher
than
your
average
english
bitter
typically
a
session
beer
but
still
very
drinkableespecially
in
moderation
d
it
drinks
very
smoothly
on
cask
at
a
youngs
pub
in
camden
town
london
had
a
half
pint
and
it
appeared
a
clear
amberorange
this
was
just
a
nice
classic
english
bitter
with
lots
of
dry
pale
malt
flavor
the
aroma
takes
a
fruitier
malt
aroma
overall
this
bitter
cleaner
is
on
the
cleaner
side
of
the
style
but
worth
trying
orange
haze
with
an
ample
head
looks
very
inviting
not
a
hell
of
a
lot
happenning
nose
wise
a
bit
of
malty
action
with
some
hop
presence
but
it
all
comes
together
on
the
palate
nice
warming
malt
with
beautiful
lingering
bitterness
that
you
just
dont
see
often
enough
in
other
beers
purporting
to
be
bitter
very
nice
aftertaste
only
had
one
bottle
unfortunately
went
down
a
treat
with
devilled
steak
burger
my
missus
made
yummo
surprisingly
sweet
on
the
front
palate
elements
of
candied
orange
but
thats
really
it
mostly
watery
and
quite
refreshing
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
again
thats
about
it
slight
bitterness
i
guess
this
is
all
in
keeping
with
the
style
smooth
drinking
with
a
minimum
of
flavour
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
full
like
swallowing
soapy
water
the
body
feels
heavier
than
expected
given
the
lack
of
flavour
this
is
a
nice
beer
a
very
well
made
english
bitter
truly
not
my
favourite
style
but
a
good
example
of
it
raw
robust
and
true
to
its
name
overall
this
was
an
interesting
and
wellbalanced
brew
that
i
wish
i
were
able
to
find
in
the
us
would
very
much
recommend
but
easily
drinkable
with
solid
flavours
golden
in
colour
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
decent
sized
tight
foam
the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
balance
of
sweet
toffee
malt
fruity
esters
and
subtle
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
rich
toffee
malt
profile
going
right
through
into
the
finish
there
is
a
firm
hop
flavour
supporting
the
sweet
malt
the
bitterness
being
superbly
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
full
yet
not
cloying
making
this
an
exceptional
session
ale
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
a
great
example
of
what
can
be
done
with
a
low
alcohol
beer
md
lightlyfizzy
but
very
well
bottleconditioned
it
retains
the
freshness
of
a
true
cask
of
youngs
bitter
while
the
slightly
higher
level
of
bitterness
contributes
a
bit
more
body
hence
more
drinkable
to
my
liking
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
success
in
bottleconditioning
one
of
the
beloved
old
tipples
of
london
i
just
wonder
why
it
took
them
so
long
before
deciding
to
do
something
like
this
esp
now
theyre
not
based
in
the
old
wandsworth
ram
brewery
anymore
its
not
very
drinkable
because
it
tastes
very
bland
note
the
version
i
drank
was
the
cask
one
which
is
only
3
7
abv
the
bottled
version
is
4
5
and
clearly
falls
outside
the
session
class
many
cask
beers
are
beefed
up
to
compensate
for
the
dumbing
down
of
flavours
when
put
in
bottles
or
cans
it
doesnt
really
work
but
thats
another
story
d
not
much
to
this
beer
just
a
good
quality
sessionable
bitter
thie
beer
is
a
well
balanced
blend
of
hoppyness
and
a
dry
thirstquenching
bitter
flavour
to
produce
a
fine
english
bitter
i
just
hope
it
doesnt
change
to
much
once
it
is
brewed
in
bedford
drinkability
a
session
beer
defined
the
old
hops
are
offputting
and
i
am
not
sure
if
they
are
intentionally
aged
or
not
but
they
dont
intrude
too
much
on
the
beers

litle
english

aswell

makes
this
brew
taste
stronger

it

and
make
it

for

some

well
carbonated
and
having
much
more
taste
as
the
avarage

not
that
much
expirience
in
this

but
for
shure
well
drinkable
and
imho
a
perfect
sessionbeer
now
the
glass
is
empty
i
miss
it
already
can
one
fall
in
love
with
an
ale
the
brew
was
bitter
to
adstringency
rather
watery
and
pretty
bland
while
i
very
much
appreciate
the
more
special
brews
from
youngs
this
one
is
but
a
disappointment
overall
subtle
and
nice
but
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
other
comments
a
good
standard
bitter
as
with
most
british
beer
much
better
on
cask
of
course
this
beer
was
a
total
bore
i
can
only
imagine
that
it
is
better
on
cask
if
someone
offers
to
pick
up
a
couple
for
you
from
over

still
quite

lightly
dry

such
a
small
beer
with

so
drinkable
to
the
point
of
going
down
like
water

on

this
is
a
genuinely
pleasant
surprise
humidity
outside
is

so
this
truly
refreshing
brew
hits
the
spot
at
only

i
could
drink
this
all
day
probably
should
but
some
brawnier
cousins
are
calling
overall
while
its
not
something
ill
necessarily
seek
out
i
respect
it
for
what
it
is
a
truly
sessionable
beer
that
manages
to
offer
considerable
flavor
and
some
degree
of
complexity
not
everything
works
perfectly
but
its
better
than
about
90
of
beers
in
its
abv
range
and
that
are
as
thin
and
thats
saying
something
othe
lack
of
balance
really
hurts
this
beer
would
not
recommend
overall
balanced
and
drinkable
plenty
of
flavor
but
goes
down
smooth
the
malt
is
central
but
the
noble
hops
truly
shine
as
a
supporting
role
in
this
session
i
always
find
french
oak
to
be
very
subtle
but
imparting
strong
vanilla
notes
this
is
an
incredibly
intriguing
drinkable
beer
overall
drinkability
i
appreciate
this
beer
a
lot
more
after
drinking
it
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
oakaged
beer
fans
overall
this
is
a
beer
worth
getting
a
six
pack
of
i
strongly
suggest
giving
long
haul
a
try
it
is
more
than
just
a
session
al
e
this
is
a
solid
beer
nice
complexity
for
a
beer
clearly
labeled
session
beer
nicely
done
good
fall
beer
for
afternoons
of
getting
stuff
done
this
is
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
well
worth
a
try
quite
sessionable
descent
flavors
and
well
balanced
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
thebeeralmanac
com
overall
still
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
taste
very
rich
oaky
nuttiness
right
off
the
bat
here
the
kicker
with
this
bitter
ale
is
the
balance
that
the
high
hoppage
and
the
strong
use
of
wheat
creates
with
the
malt
overall
this
is
a
really
freakin
smooth
beer
with
great
balance
extremely
drinkable
i
guess
the
bottle
name
session
says
it
all
overall
definitely
not
the
best
idea
or
ale
they
had
the
same
french
oak
on
ipa
does
wonders
but
these
bitters
aged
just
made
it
tart
and
unenjoyable
o
a
nice
brew
drinks
crisp
and
smooth
good
taste
overall
enjoyable
could
find
it
better
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
after
or
while
mowing
the
lawn
o
obviously
a
sessionable
beer
and
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
however
based
on
the
look
and
smell
i
expected
more
in
the
flavor
i
think
this
could
use
a
tad
more
malt
or
some
more
of
the
oak
to
cut
what
i
believe
to
be
a
slightly
unpleasant
aftertaste
t
there
is
sweetness
floral
nice
bitterness
ending
pinu
a
little
bit
earthy
the
final
is
long
bitter
tasting
a
little
bit
dry
i
think
this
beer
succeeds
in
what
its
trying
to
be
this
is
definitely
tasty
enough
to
be
a
true
session
beer
but
ive
had
other
lower
abvs
that
have
packed
in
better
flavor
overall
this
beer
will
make
you
realize
how
great
common
american
session
beers
could
be
but
are
not
this
is
a
wonderfully
executed
brew
pours
a
clean
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
gingerbread
like
malt
and
a
small
oak
note
in
the
taste
quite
oaky
and
a
gingerbread
malt
that
goes
from
sweet
to
dry
a
small
bite
amd
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
gingerbread
like
malt
aftertaste
quite
english
and
a
nice
mellow
oak
this
is
an
ok
beer
its
sessionable
but
the
fairly
lackluster
taste
and
foaming
mouthfeel
are
a
turnoff
if
you
want
a
sessionable
ale
two
brothers
pale
ale
is
only
slightly
more
alcoholic
and
boasts
more
complexity
to
this
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
a
great
amount
of
flavor
for
a
session
beer
would
drink
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
long
haul
session
ale
is
a
brown
colored
ale
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
the
body
is
pretty
clear
with
just
a
slight
haze
the
aroma
of
this
brew
has
both
caramel
malt
and
bitter
hop
elements
to
it
maybe
a
bit
of
fruit
as
well
as
i
take
a
sip
and
look
into
it
i
find
out
that
the
beer
is
oakaged
for
at
least
a
month
and
that
oakiness
comes
through
i
would
say
that
flavor
dominates
the
rest
which
consists
of
light
hops
and
a
bit
of
bitter
hop
some
apple
comes
through
as
well
medium
bodied
and
very
sharp
on
the
tongue
pours
a
pale
copper
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
very
light
aroma
some
malty
sweetness
and
hints
of
vanilla
in
the
flavor
pale
malts
mild
caramel
sweetness
and
definate
oak
presence
chalky
yeast
and
tannins
coat
the
palate
still
mild
in
its
flavors
simple
but
a
nice
session
brew
at

2
the
lightest
oak
influenced
brew
ive
come
across
as
well
o
really
a
strange
beer
the
idea
just
doesnt
make
any
sense
to
me
o
a
very
flavorful
session
beer
the
oak
aging
really
ads
a
lot
good
drinkability
though
it
is
a
little
more
sour
than
i
would
like
it
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
solid
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
the
hop
aroma
is
adequate
but
nothing
too
incredible
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
somewhat
bitter
flavor
that
boasts
of
english
hops
and
palecrystal
malts
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
thats
well
balanced
and
quite
flavorful
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
session
ale
its
nothing
bold
but
drinks
well
and
is
accessible
to
most
people
pours
darker
brown
than
i
expected
with
off
white
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
and
good
retention
the
smell
is
pleasant
malt
but
not
too
pungent
the
body
is
medium
but
very
smooth
the
french
oak
aging
has
given
this
beer
a
nice
tangy
bite
but
it
isnt
near
as
noticeable
as
it
is
in
the
resistence
ipa
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
with
a
unique
fruitiness
and
delicious
malt
finish
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
d
fitting
to
the
intention
of
brewer
nice
but
not
really
grabbing
me
definitely
more
interesting
than
a
domestic
adjunct
lager
but
nothing
amazing
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
ok
but
i
dont
know
that
ill
order
it
again
o
drinks
easy
but
i
became
tired
of
it
quickly
sunday
afternoon
hockey
which
is
a
rarity
usually
we
are
at
10pm
or
later
so
we
make
the
most
of
it
by
having
a
bbq
afterward
our
silky
defensemen
stopped
by
two
bros
on
his
way
to
all
seasons
to
pick
up
two
growlers
of
long
haul
and
they
tasted
mighty
fine
after
a
61
win
the
color
was
a
nice
carmelly
clear
with
white
foamy
head
the
smell
was
hinted
with
malt
other
than
that
not
much
there
the
taste
was
very
well
balanced
and
quite
nice
after
sweatin
my
ass
off
session
is
a
great
description
for
this
beer
could
drink
it
in
droves
overall
a
pretty
good
session
beer
as
promised
worth
a
try
but
two
brothers
have
other
better
beers
o
at
4
2
you
can
have
all
you
want
and
still
not
tie
one
on
its
a
good
practice
beer
o
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
beer
sessionable
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
because
the
sourness
keeps
the
taste
interesting
i
admire
any
brewery
who
in
this
age
of
mindless
hoppy
excess
puts
such
care
into
building
a
flagship
session
this
is
a
very
very
nice
beer
o
very
tasty
beer
id
definitely
have
it
again

the

is
that
of
sweet
lighlty
toasted
bread
or
biscuit
i
dont
pick
up
really
any
of
the
oak
notes
but
it
does
have
a
ever
so
slight

aroma

it
they
may
be
caused
by
the

mouthfeel
sweet
caramel
like
start
with
a
light
drawn

flavor
that
just
sort
of
melts
away
nothing
overpowering
here
in
this
one
would
like
to
see
maybe
a
dash
more
hop
character
to
this
along
with
possibly
more
of
the
oak
overall
not
bad
the
plusses
are
the
looks
and
the
light
abv
which
makes
it
a
solid
choice
for
a
light
beer
great
concept
and
brew
from
two
brothers
this
would
be
something
that
would
be
excellent
in
an
english
pub
on
cask
kind
of
underperforms
in
its
current
state
what
the
hell
did
i
just
get
myself
into
this

a

express
the
style
although
the
smell
and
flavor
didnt
do
it
for
me
session
ale
no
this
beer
just
seems
wrong
in
many
ways
sorry
but
maybe
a
third
brother
could
come
in
to
make
this
beer
right
pours
a
moderatelydark
copper
color
with
a
singlefinger
offwhite
head
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
and
a
nice
cap
and
collar
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
some
slightlycaramelized
malt
along
with
a
touch
of
fruit
and
some
toffee
the
taste
is
mildly
bitter
and
somewhat
sweet
mostly
focusing
on
bready
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
medium
body
with
lower
levels

pretty
nice
all
around
id
certainly
pick
this
up

not
buy
thats
for
sure
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
another
nice
very
drinkable
beer
from
two
brothers
this
one
is
a
good
solid
beer
all
around
it
has
a
nice
color
and
the
depth
and
aroma
is
very
enjoyable
its
flavor
isnt
as
deep
as
its
color
but
in
general
its
a
simple
yet
very
enjoyable
drink
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
stick
with
all
night
d
i
find
this
to
be
extremely
drinkable
it
even
tastes
like
there
should
be
more
abv
then
there
is
great
tastes
and
complexities
a
solid
session
brew
from
two
brothers
d
lots
of
flavor
for
a
session
brew
it
wouldnt
be
a
first
choice
for
me
honestly
but
it
has
some
nice
balance
going
on
with
a
good
finish
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
copperamber
color
with
a
short
creamy
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
bready
malt
with
some
brown
sugar
notes
perhaps
a
touch
of
vanilla
as
well
the
flavor
is
of
a
steely
caramel
malt
some
fruity
and
metallic
notes
sour
oak
grassyearthy
hops
and
a
bit
of
a
brown
sugarbrown
ale
thing
going
on
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
soft
to
tingly
carbonation
generally
sweet
but
has
a
touch
of
sour
and
bitterness
to
help
balance
a
very
well
made
and
solid
feeling
brew
a
big
plus
for
the
4
2abv
after
an
almost
never
ending
trip
of
bad
tasting
beer
i
cant
believe
how
good
this
beer
is
i
love
two
brothers
call
me
partial
but
i
just
proved
why
i
love
em
this
is
a
nice
dark
session
ale
aged
on
french
oak
foudres
whatever
it
takes
this
beer
definitely
doesnt
suck
appears
a
dark
caramel
amber
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
finely
speckled
evenly
across
my
pint
glass
aroma
has
hints
of
apple
cider
french
oak
and
fruity
undertones
flavor
is
wonderful
dark
fruit
raisin
tart
apple
and
oak
belonging
on
my
palate
as
a
comprehensive
flavor
profile
with
each
sip
carbonation
is
mellow
has
all
get
out
and
it
goes
down
smoother
than
any
other
barrel
aged
beer
ive
ever
had
extreme
flavor
but
limited
alcohol
and
body
that
doesnt
outweight
long
haul
is
a
perfect
concept
meant
for
the
craft
beer
revolution
drinkability
incredibly
satisfying
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
next
time
or
if
it
ever
comes
into
pa
i
will
swear
to
buy
cases
of
two
brothers
and
drink
regularly
d
the
abv
on
the
beer
makes
this
very
drinkable
although
this
beer
is
not
my
style
at
all
and
i
dont
really
care
for
it
flavor
wise
this
beer
is
judged
on
the
style
and
not
my
personal
preference
though
therefore
it
gets
the
marks
it
does
good
not
great
for
a
sessiona
real
session
ale
for
gonzo
exxxtreme
american
beers
d
overall
a
strange
yet
sessionable
brew
all
the
flavors
work
to
make
this
drinkable
hazy

enough
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
as
part
of
the
tour
as
recommended
highly
by
the
tour
guide
a
light
copper
color
with
some
ok
retention
the
aroma
is
super
weird
malty
caramel
with
spices
french
fries
only
a
slight
bit
of
oak
taste
is
mostly
malt
a
little
oak
just
boring
im
senxing
a
trend
here
in
their
beers
light
oak
not
where
would
should
be
and
boring
although
tbbc
long
haul
session
ale
sounds
good
on
paper
it
falls
a
bit
short
when
beer
meets
taste
buds
it
might
be
worth
a
brief
jaunt
single
bottle
if
youre
curious
about
an
oakaged
english
bitter
from
an
american
craft
brewery
but
it
isnt
worth
a
long
haul
sixer
for
this
ba
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
the
head
is
an
inch
and
a
half
in
height
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
nice
sticky
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
this
is
a
nice
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
vanilla
caramel
a
hint
of
cherry
and
toast
this
isnt
the
strongest
aroma
but
it
has
very
good
complexity
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
and
full
of
wonderful
subtleties
the
finish
is
of
lingering
vanilla
and
very
mild
cherry
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
overall
a
decent
ale
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
small
head
that
did
not
last
very
long
just
a
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
in
the
aroma
i
pick
up
some
diacetyl
and
a
little
acidity
a
little
vanilla
comes
out
as
well
i
do
not
detect
any
hops
which
is
unfortunate
i
taste
a
lot
of
malt
that
gives
this
beer
a
bready
nature
the
diacetyl
comes
out
again
not
a
deal
breaker
in
this
style
very
balanced
between
the
malt
and
hops
hard
to
conclude
that
this
beer
has
had
any
special
aging
i
would
place
this
beer
more
into
the
esb
style
as
it
is
more
balanced
than
a
bitter
light
body
with
very
low
carbonation
could
of
used
a
little
more
life
in
the
body
about
the
only
great
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
low
abv
which
would
make
this
sessionable
just
not
that
well
crafted
to
want
to
buy
this
again
though
d
for
as
many
flavors
as
i
was
able
to
pluck
from
this
beer
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
this
one
d
amazing
i
cant
believe
this
is
only
4
2
abv
this
is
what
craft
brewers
should
be
making
to
compete
with
bmc
d
i
like
that
they
made
a
lower
abv
session
beer
i
like
that
they
tried
something
different
with
the
oakbarrel
aging
i
just
didnt
like
the
result
too
much
theres
not
much
unsessionable
about
this
one
purchased
from
binnys
beverage
depot
in
warrenville
il
pours
a
medium
amber
body
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
of
peach
and
fleshy
fruit
and
lemon
grass
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
the
initial
fleshy
fruit
flavors
lead
to
a
more
caramelly
and
dusty
finish
very
unique
flavors
good
drinkability
an
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
for
the
relatively
low
abv
nicely
balanced
and
certainly
sessionable
d
easy
to
put
back
a
couple
and
with
the
low
abv
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
idea
the
biggest
drawback
is
the
price
tag
at
10
for
6
d
malt
flavor
is
a
bit
old
or
dull
tasting
but
it
is
quickly
overtaken
by
pure
pungent
hops
this
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
session
beer
as
the
hops
out
of
bounds
compared
to
malt
and
other
flavors
d
this
is
a
well
named
beer
as
it
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
session
with
dthis
was
one
really
nice
easy
drinking
beer
i
went
into
this
one
blind
figuring
that
it
would
be
something
sessionable
duh
but
besides
that
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
the
chocolate
malt
notes
pushed
this
beer
over
the
top
for
me
in
terms
of
grabbing
my
interest
d
this
beer
is
intriguing
in
concept
oak
aged
session
ale
but
it
falls
short
due
to
its
lack
of
flavor
it
is
a
decent
session
beer
as
it
is
easy
drinking
and
low
in
alcohol
but
nothing
here
stands
out
a
good
choice
for
a
no
frills
session
there
is
not
a
lot
going
on
but
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
recommended
easy
drinking
fits
the
name
its
clearly
a
low
alcohol
session
style
ale
not
bad
this
pared
real
well
with
a
cheddar
burger
this
beer
wont
be
one
of
the
bold
and
brawny
standouts
but
that
isnt
what
its
designed
to
do
so
dont
be
put
off
by
its
rating
overall
drinkable
but
not
memorable
could
do
without
the
metallic
quality
medium
heft
in
the
mouth
lightly
carbonated
just
a
decent
drinker
for
the
seasons
between
summer
and
winter
very
drinkable
one
to
keep
around
as
a
regular
a
very
decent
bitter
from
this
side
of
the
pond
d
an
interesting
beer
to
end
up
in
a
barrel
considering
the
hyped
up
beers
being
put
in
them
today
but
i
really
like
what
the
barrel
has
done
to
this
beer
and
think
that
subsequent
versions
of
this
beer
could
get
even
better
there
are
some
weaker
points
to
this
beer
where
it
seems
things
tend
to
wash
together
midway
though
the
drinking
session
but
otherwise
this
beer
adds
up
to
a
fine
session
beer
d
a
decent
session
bitter
that
comes
off
as
uncluttered
unfussy
and
well
uninspiring
ill
revisit
this
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
this
is
a
decent
beer
more
of
one
im
buying
to
give
a
bottle
to
alot
of
my
bmc
drinking
friends
as
a
gateway
beer
as
its
great
as
a
gateway
beer
its
very
interesting
to
have
for
the
beer
geek
because
of
the
oak
presence
in
this
style
of
beer
but
not
enough
for
a
whole
six
pack
fairly
nondescript
toasted
malt
aroma
almost
lagerish
in
a
way
not
getting
any
oak
here
flavor
is
malt
dominated
maybe
a
kiss
of
fruit
from
the
yeast
somewhat
dry
finish
with
mild
bitterness
easy
going
light
bodied
even
carbonation
searching
for
any
oak
character
and
coming
up
short
fits
the
bill
for
a
warm
weather
session
beer
but
not
especially
complex
or
memorable
drinkability
is
good
yes
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
but
just
not
at
9
99
a
sixer
this
a
malty
smooth
and
faintly
grainy
feeling
beer
a
very
flavorful
and
unique
session
ale
that
i
would
love
to
have
on
tap
the
label
on
this
one
tells
it
all
this
is
the
session
beer
this
is
my
second
six
pack
of
this
stuff
and
it
wont
be
my
last
id
love
to
try
this
on
a
hand
pull
not
really
working
for
me
smell
is
a
bit
off
and
taste
is
mediocre
at
best
the
resistance
ipa
is
a
much
better
offering
if
you
want
to
try
the
new
two
bros
oaked
beers
warmed
up
and
the
oak
seems
to
express
itself
a
little
more
with
a
very
woody
character
as
opposed
to
the
vanilla
which
it
can
sometimes
contribute
to
beer
overall
pretty
tasty
and
much
bolder
than
its
alcohol
content
would
suggest
perhaps
it
could
have
a
bit
more
body
at
least
up
front
but
i
would
drink
this
one
again
a
passable
brit
bitter
after
you
take
into
account
the
time
it
spent
getting
here
ive
had
it
in
the
uk
and
liked
it
more
maybe
the
pub
ambiance
vs
the
sports
bar
vibe
at
sharp
edge
fullers
doesnt
make
the
best
brews
but
theyre
still
ok
clear
amber
with
a
slightly
soapy
cap
spotty
lacing
solid
head
retention
though
it
didnt
start
with
much
floral
and
earthy
nose
malty
aroma
quite
nice
balanced
bitterness
countered
the
malts
and
hop
character
medium
to
light
bodied
low
carbonation
a
good
pint
very
balanced
and
drinkable
was
expecting
better
from
fullers
still
an
enjoyable
bitter
o
i
could
almost
tell
in
a
blind
taste
test
that
this
was
the
fullers
yeast
the
flavors
are
onpoint
but
perhaps
a
bit
more
subtle
than
i
would
have
expected
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
id
likely
opt
for
something
with
a
bit
more
dimension
overall
it
is
a
very
good
english
bitter
light
and
lean
with
clear
hop
leanings
but
approachable
and
easily
drinkable
light
english
bitter
got
it
more
refreshing
and
with
higher
drinkability
than
some
similar
peers
though
i
found
it
somewhat
watery
good
as
a
session
beer
gets
the
hops
across
especially
for
the
strength
oily
body
is
unexpected
and
boosts
the
body
in
whats
otherwise
not
gonna
have
much
sugar
in
it
a
very
doable
session
bitter
this
is
a
good
english
bitter
but
not
the
best
its
a
little
safe
to
be
honest
its
hoppy
but
could
be
more
so
a
little
watery
it
feels
nice
though
and
goes
down
smooth
and
refreshing
british
ale
is
just
plain
good
so
an
average
one
will
still
be
worth
drinking
smells
malty
and
grassy
but
not
too
strong
with
the
low
alcohol
it
makes
a
great
beer
to
drink
tons
of
worth
getting
just
a
little
on
the
safe
side
this
beer
got
some
problems
the
metal
hints
in
the
bitterness
the
somewhat
dense
minerals
in
the
finish
still
it
is
one
of
the
best
3
5
beers
around
a
very
nice
lowalcohol
bitter
o
for
being
a
beer
i
can
pick
up
any
day
from
my
local
grocery
store
this
one
is
quite
ok
when
compared
to
the
alternatives
i
wouldnt
buy
it
on
tap
if
i
had
the
chance
above
average
beer
but
far
below
par
considering
who
makes
itfullers
very
light
golden
colour
with
a
quicklydissipating
head
it
is
light
bodied
as
one
would
expect
from
such
a
lowalcohol
session
ale
flavours
are
still
fairly
impressive
though
bread
grain
and
floral
hops
with
a
delicate
subtle
bitterness
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
while
still
providing
satisfying
flavour
o
this
beer
is
not
the
boldflavorful
hop
forward
beer
that
many
of
my
fellow
american
hop
heads
would
expect
but
it
is
an
excellent
english
bitter
for
a
beer
with
such
a
low
alcohol
content
this
beer
still
comes
through
beautifully
with
a
light
easy
drinking
flavorful
beer
great
session
beer
od
a
nice
bitter
ive
had
this
on
cask
at
the
fullers
brewery
and
it
tasted
better
there
but
i
enjoyed
the
bottled
version
too
great
flavour
for
the
abv
definitely
a
session
beer
a
decent
bitter
though
probably
better
on
cask
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
but
the
flavour
is
nicely
rounded
with
a
definite
hint
of
aromatic
hops
sadly
lacking
in
many
session
bitters
drinkable
if
you
dont
want
anything
too
challenging
overall
nice
brew
the
least
hoppy
of
the
english
bitters
brewed
by
fullers
i
was
thirlled
to
find
the
chiswick
bitter
in
the
us
even
if
it
were
on
nitro
i
wouldnt
mind
doing
a
few
pints
in
a
session
even
if
its
supppose
to
be
a
shadow
of
itself
stateside
as
far
as
a
session
bitter
goes
this
wasnt
bad
at
all
it
took
me
about
two
pints
of
this
to
finally
figure
the
brew
out
and
train
my
mind
not
to
see
this
as
fullers
light
but
rather
as
its
own
entity
as
a
mild
ale
chiswick
went
down
easy
with
a
low
abv
and
decent
cask
ale
flavor
cask
conditioned
at
the
blackbird
earls
court
london
a
fullers
pub
served
at

temperature
minimal
natural
carbonation
low
head
golden
to
amber
colour
moderate
citrussy
aroma
hints
of
horse
stable
light
bodied
decent

a
nice
little
beer
this
one
but
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
i
admit
i
really
wanted
the
esb
but
ratings
are
ratings
dgiven
the
plethora
of
other
options
this
wouldnt
be
on
the
top
of
my
list
still
its
a
fine
beer
and
one
worth
seeking
out
d
solid
english
bitter
sessionable
could
have
more
but
there
are
better
representations
of
this
style
d
this
fits
into
the
style
well
light
in
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
not
overly
impressive
but
not
bad
by
any
means
my
first
chiswick
bitter
after
finally
working
up
the
wontons
to
not
go
for
my
favourite
fullers
london
pride
definitely
worth
the
visit
one
of
the
best
bitters
overall
a
light
session
ale
a
good
standard
bitter
d
a
great
beer
for
a
session
quality
english
bitter
which
is
very
quaffable
this
fits
the
style
well
and
at
3
6
i
could
drink
this
all
night
probably
and
still
not
be
bored
i
would
not
drink
this
again
except
in
an
emergency
where
i
needed
hops
and
lots
thereof
to
survive

is
quite
nice
mild
goldings
bitterness
over
light
caramel
and
crady
malts
light
tropical
fruitiness
and
a
hint
of
tea
taste
is
weaker
most
of
the
bitterness
is
lost
and
it
winds
up
being
too
sweet
and
one
dimensional
mouthfeel
is
awfully
watery
and
much
too
thin
drinkability
is
fine
but
its
not
something
that
i
feel
compelled
to
return
to
fullers
is
one
of
my
favourite
breweries
but
this
is
quite
a
letdown
pours

thick

slowly
settles

a

middle

in

no

mouthfeel

with

carbonation
i
like
it
but
not
much
of
a
bitter
doesnt
have
a
kick
in
the
finish
so
comes
across
as
a
little
weak
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
more
or
less
average
but
i
will
say
this
is
not
a
typical
english
bitter
in
many
respects
too
much
refreshing
bite
and
sweetness
its
a
wonder
to
me
how
tea
can
remain
such
a
popular
drink
in
britain
given
the
accessibility
to
wonderfully
crafted
delicious
and
satisfying
low
strength
ales
like
fullers
chiswick
english
milds
and
bitters
are
not
always
good
but
when
they
are
theyre
often
truly
phenomenal
and
thats
definitely
the
word
id
use
to
sum
up
this
beer
my
local
off
licence
in
dublin
began
stocking
bottles
of
chiswick
a
while
back
but
i
avoided
it
because
i
remember
trying
a
glass
of
it
from
cask
in
london
and
not
being
particularly
impressed
im
a
big
fan
of
london
pride
but
for
some
reason
that
halfpint
of
chiso
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
anyway
i
now
reckon
it
must
have
been
a
dodgy
cask
because
the
bottle
i
eventually
decided
to
pick
up
last
night
was
excellent
the
colouring
is
a
nice
orange
and
more
like
an
american
pale
ale
than
a
traditional
english
ale
the
taste
is
also
quite
different
to
other
english
ales
which
i
find
quite
maltheavy
nor
is
it
like
a
hopheavy
american
ale
however
it
retains
its
own
distinctive
english
hoppiness
which
gives
it
a
nice
aroma
and
a
really
fresh
aftertaste
finally
i
like
the
way
the
way
its
low
in
alcohol
content
but
still
very
full
bodied
and
flavoursome
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
with
a
great
hop
profile
and
ill
definitely
be
trying
it
on
cask
next
time
im
in
london
what
a
great
beer
there
may
be
better
bitters
in
england
so
this
is
being
given
the
american
beer
drinkers
bias
however
definitely
above
average
for
the
style
extremely
enjoyable
even
though
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
it
this
is
the
ultimate
session
beer
an
easydrinking
ale
with
a
fullers
house
character
on
the
hoppy
side
for
an
english
session
bitter
and
could
use
a
touch
more
malt
or
fruity
character
but
tasty
and
i
cant
help
but
wonder
how
this
is
like
on
cask
interesting
that
the
score
is
so
low
had
this
one
on
tap
at
mahars
and
it
was
poured
at
a
very
good
temperature
not
warm
but
by
no
means
cold
the
color
was
a
medium
to
dark
colored
yellow
with
a
very
good
sized
white
head
that
had
very
good
retention
and
left
nice
chunky
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
pretty
good
though
it
was
a
little
light
what
was
there
was
a
nice
fruit
aroma
and
slight
hop
presence
the
flavors
of
this
brew
where
pretty
nice
some
what
muted
but
what
was
there
was
quite
tasty
the
malts
come
out
more
here
and
the
fruit
flavors
seem
to
be
more
citric
reminds
me
a
little
of
lemons
while
this
brew
was
some
what
muted
on
both
the
aroma
and
taste
fronts
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
the
flavors
that
are
there
seem
to
work
a
very
good
session
brew
i
hope
that
mahars
might
be
able
to
get
this
on
cask
sometime
as
they
do
bring
in
some
very
nice
things
in
that
format
experiences
like
this
disillusion
me
excellent
lighter
abv
for
those
who
like
a
tasty
session
beer
without
having
to
worry
about
the
alcohol
hit
wish
i
could
get
it
locally
as
an
option
a
bit
less
than
medium
mouthfeel
this
beer
pales
in
comparison
to
london
pride
i
managed
to
finish
my
pint
but
i
wouldnt
bother
ordering
another
one
ever
fullers
chisick
bitter
is
a
great
session
bitter
the
apperence
is
of
dark
blond
and
the
smell
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
and
the
taste
nice
and
bitter
with
a
full
burst
of
hops
a
great
beer
to
keep
drinking
all
night
long
and
is
up
there
with
youngs
bitter
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
thin
which
makes
it
okay
the
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
like
many
bitters
overall
a
very
good
bitter
very
drinkable
recommended
md
given
the
aboveaverage
flavour
the
mouthfeel
is
a
failure
hererather
unbalanced
with
way
too
much
sharp
fizz
at
work
and
making
the
texture
hyper
and
even
slightly
thin
maybe
due
to
my
long
experience
of
drinking
chiswick
on
cask
im
naturally
biased
in
favour
of
the
caskconditioned
version
but
i
sincerely
think
the
casked
chiswick
really
is
the
right
form
to
appreciate
this
hoppy
and
bitter
classic
real
ale
something
the
bottled
one
could
only
dream
of
comparing
with
a
gratifying
amount
of
flavor
and
character
for
a
session
beer
and
the
light
body
and
refreshing
hoppytart
edge
make
it
a
joy
to
drink
a
classic
session
pint
more
please
it
pours
a
nice
light
gold
color
with
a
typical
england
cask
beer
head
thats
small
and
bubbly
the
smell
is
of
earthy
hops
and
biscuits
the
taste
is
much
hoppier
than
i
anticipated
pithy
crisp
and
lemony
very
pleasant
a
solid
honeyish
malt
background
rounds
up
the
flavor
truly
an
excellent
session
beer
very
full
flavored
yet
light
bodied
i
still
prefer
the
old
style
fullers
pumpclips
that
looked
like
shields
though
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
fine
ale
its
a
very
clear
copper
color
the
thin
airy
head
leaves
fine
lacing
tart
hops
lean
a
bit
towards
lemony
lightish
mouthfeel
but
it
is
a
standard
bitter
totally
refreshing
and
quaffable
a
worthy
competitor
to
the
king
of
ales
youngs
bitter
perhaps
this
beer
is
the
prince
of
wales
outstanding
nice
colour
and
a
good
head
with
a
subtle
aroma
holy
moly
for
a
beer
with
3
5
this
is
quite
amazing
lots
of
floral
hops
quite
light
hoppy
perhaps
slightly
bready
malty
notes
bitter
and
floral
great
for
session
drinking
very
good
nice
and
dry
sampled
draught
at
the
brewery
and
at
various
pubs
in
london
very
sorry
i
went
to
this
pub
food
was
ok
but
the
beers
were
mediocre
to
poor
i
was
surprised
by
how
good
this
brew
is
will
definitely
have
more
o
not
and
esb
at
all
no
bitterness
how
could
it
be
an
esb
its
style
is
more
like
an
extra
pale
ale
one
of
the
better
beers
at
grittys
i
though
which
isnt
saying
a
whole
lot
but
this
classic
bitter
and
amber
style
fusion
worked
out
pretty
well
pours
a
lighter
amber
color
flat
though
like
all
beers
i
had
here
smells
like
light
english
pale
and
crystal
malts
with
the
same
ale
yeast
as
the
others
and
a
pronounced
english
hop
finish
which
is
this
beers
best
feature
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
lighter
than
it
looks
sessionable
more
than
any
other
beer
they
had
carbonation
is
severely
lacking
as
it
has
the
texture
of
tap
water
plenty
of
body
for
the
style
maybe
a
nitro
tap
would
liven
this
up
but
it
just
sits
there
dead
still
one
of
grittys
better
beers
went
well
with
the
food
and
didnt
offend
me
like
their
ipa
did
so
thats
a
start
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
served
on
cask
and
poured
in
a
true
pint
the
beer
is
a
clear
pale
chestnut
coloring
with
a
light
foamy
frothy
offwhite
head
of
about
a
half
an
inch
aromas
of
rich
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
slight
roasting
characteristic
overall
flavors
are
smooth
with
toffee
and
butter
sweetness
and
a
kiss
of
chocolate
hops
presence
is
extremely
minimal
with
only
a
hint
of
bitter
at
the
tail
end
the
hops
presence
does
build
as
you
drink
but
still
a
minority
player
on
the
palate
the
body
is
very
light
and
there
is
a
smooth
and
creamy
texture
that
completely
owes
itself
to
the
cask
serving
the
aftertaste
is
a
slight
linger
of
the
toffee
sweetness
with
a
slightly
drying
finish
flavors
and
overall
experience
of
the
beer
arent
bad
but
there
just
seems
to
be
an
overall
lackluster
feel
to
it
all
palate
seems
watered
down
throughout
and
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
o
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
things
going
on
in
this
beer
and
it
all
comes
together
nicely
i
would
gladly
drink
several
of
these
if
this
beer
was
available
to
me
in
dated
sixpacks
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
pretty
regularly
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
creamy
white
head
aromas
of
sweet
malt
and
earthy
floral
hops
flavors
of
lightly
toasted
caramel
malt
and
more
earthy
floral
hops
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
with
a
decent
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
mediumthin
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
nice
drinkable
bitter
but
nothing
to
get
excited
over
pours
a
relatively
clear
copper
with
disappointing
head
for
a
hand
pumped
beer
scent
is
lightly
caramel
and
nutty
earthy
and
grassy
hops
with
a
presence
from
the
yeast
taste
follows
suit
quite
light
and
in
fact
bitter
light
caramel
and
nutty
malts
earthy
hops
and
a
woodiness
throughout
thinner
side
of
medium
bodied
slightly
over
carbonated
good
bitter
meant
to
be
light
in
flavor
but
lacks
something
in
its
construction
overall
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
but
thats
fair
for
the
style
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
some
interesting
flavors
show
what
the
aroma
did
not
i
bet
this
would
be
mighty
tasty
on
cask
overall
pretty
decent
nothing
special
but
a
nice
bitter
on
cask
thankfully
low
on
herbal
hops
md
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
thick

otherwise
nice

not
great

sessionable
second
beer
of
the
night
at
the
portland
location
served
on
cask
for
4
which
i
thought
was
a
good
price
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
light
brown
in
color
with
minimal
head
very
faint
smell
of
malt
taste
was
of
very
mellow
hops
mouthfeel
from
the
cask
made
this
beer
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
temp
mouthfeel
and
flavor
all
made
this
beer
a
great
session
beer
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
gulp
a
great
beer
to
end
the
night
with
as
we
watched
the
game
overall
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
going
in
but
it
was
actually
a
pretty
decent
beer
definitely
average
but
not
a
bad
session
bitter
d
its
fine
really
but
nothing
that
really
makes
you
want
to
come
racing
back
for
another
drinkability
there
is
a
nice
malt
and
hop
mix
here
i
could
have
three
but
not
six
a
nice
above
average
bitter
cask
is
definitely
the
way
to
have
this
beer
usually
the
bottles
are
just
on
the
shelf
for
too
long
drinkability
very
drinkable
session
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
off
their
tap
this
beer
was
a
hazy
amber
color
the
head
was
khakicolored
the
retention
decent
the
lacing
scattered
the
aroma
was
subtle
yet
again
a
blend
of
crystal
malt
and
some
hoppy
bitterness
the
flavors
were
good
but
unremarkable
some
malt
sweetness
at
first
then
pale
malt
and
the
bitterness
towards
the
end
but
for
a
best
bitter
it
was
awfully
malty
still
the
hoppy
crisp
finish
was
onpoint
and
it
did
strike
me
as
rather
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
pleasant
enough
helping
it
be
sessionable
not
bad

mixture
of

and
maybe
something
a
little

i
think

this
bitter
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
a
thin
foam
layer
the
smell
was
mild
malt
and
some
hops
the
taste
was
mostly
malt
with
some
biscuity
flavor
and
some
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
crisp
with
medium
body
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
there
was
a
nice
floral
hop
taste
in
the
finish
this
was
a
good
bitter
and
would
be
a
decent
session
brew
nice
amber
with
an
off
white

fruity
and
grainy
malts
add
sweetness
est
kemp
hops
flow
to
add
the
best
bitter
mouthfeel
is
great
a
very
nice
brew
on
cask
certainly
worth
a
sample
or
two
or
three
or
four
i
stopped
at
one
but
there
was
more
beer
to
drink
this
is
a
great
bitter
on
cask
smooth
refreshing
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
come
to
think
of
it
i
have
drank
these
all
day
long
before
this
one
is
well
worth
a
trip
to
maine
to
have
on
cask
imho
a
straightforward
nononsense
bitter
crystalclear
medium
copper
with
smallish
head
that
didnt
go
anywhere
a
handful
of
caramel
malts
buttressed
perfectly
by
a
quite
mild
hop
character
authentically
british
lemon
in
the
finish
creamy
thinnish
mouthfeel
some
metallic
water
qualities
solidly
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
interested
without
inflicting
palate
fatigue
brings
back
memories
of
huddling
over
a
table
in
grittys
pub
in
portland
maine
also
makes
me
want
to
try
grittys
other
bottled
offerings
weird
to
see
other
bottles
of
booze
pictured
on
the
label
deep
copper
is
the
color
of
the
beer
as
it
sits
in
my
glass
with
a
head
that
is
magnanimous
in
its
size
frothy
in
its
consistency
malt
dominates
the
slightly
sweet
and
crisp
nose
begins
somewhat
sweet
the
top
is
lean
the
finish
is
benignly
carbonated
the
hops
purposeful
in
their
spiciness
droughty
long
lasting
aftertaste
maybe
i
have
a
bias
towards
cask
ales
but
this
is
a
very
tasty
offering
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
spicy
with
a
hint
of
lingering
bitterness
the
body
is
full
and
smooth
with
a
great
malty
flavor
profile
very
nice
not
what
i
exspected
not
overly
bitter
in
fact
had
a
light
taste
smooth
and
easy
drinking
the
hops
looming
in
the
background
of
every
gulp
could
easily
drink
this
all
the
time
tasted
more
like
a
lager
to
me
pours
a
perect
copper
collor
with
a
big
off
white
head
that
forms
a
very
nice
lace
smell
is
of
english
style
hops
with
some
light
toasty
malt
in
the
background
smooth
toasty
malt
opens
up
the
flavor
and
it
is
in
almost
perfect
balance
with
the
nice
subtle
hopping
of
the
east
kent
hops
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
and
very
drinkable
i
can
only
imagine
what
this
would
be
like
on
cask
perhaps
someday
i
will
find
out
for
myself
thanks
to
the
bierman
and
johhnyp
for
the
sample
a
good
smooth
session

a
spot

i
decent
bitter

be

here
balanced
quite
well
flavourful
make
sure
you
dont
drink
this
brew
cold
it
will
mask
all
of
the
true
bitter
style
flavours
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
as
i
let
it
open
up
not
brilliant
though
i
reckon
the
age
of
the
bottle
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
looks
alright
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
overly
yeasty
and
otherwise
quite
bland
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
a
shade
overcarbonated
possible
yeast
overdevelopment
or
cell
death
giving
some
offnotes
to
the
character
nothing
special
but
might
be
worth
sampling
again
if
i
have
the
chance
no
need
to
hunt
it
down
o
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
goes
down
quite
easily
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
bitterness
isnt
overly
strong

a

the
bitter

with
plenty

to
support

and

take
on
a
more
earthy
and
herbal
quality
on
the
tongue
the
malt
foundation
is
bready
and
dry
quite
crisp
theres
a
mineral
backbone
that
seems
to
enhance
the
dryness
adding
a
bit
of
astringency
that
doesnt
go
too
far
its
a
light
bodied
beer
but
not
as
thin
as
some
bitters
can
be
theres
just
enough
heft
applelike
fruitiness
appears
midpalate
but
the
strong
bitterness
in
the
finish
quickly
washes
it
away
bitterness
could
stand
to
be
dialed
down
a
bit
i
feel
like
it
covers
up
some
of
the
complexity
nonetheless
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
id
definitely
buy
again
overall
there
wasnt
much
about
this
beer
that
stood
out
but
it
was
absurdly
easy
to
drink
worth
a
shot
from
notes
fairly
drinkable
if
you
want
an
average
bitter
but
overall
nothing
remarkable
here
no
need
to
search
out
or
pay
the
inflated
export
price
d
overall
a
pretty
nice
esb
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
session
beer
would
try
again
i
had
a
bottle
at
tap
and
table
last
week
review
is
from
notes
and
was
actually
blown
away
by
how
good
a
bitter
could
be
from
a
bottle
the
beer
had
a
light
multigrain
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
cocoa
and
coffee
as
i
continued
to
drink
more
character
opened
up
with
big
grassy
and
lemon
hops
and
a
peppery
tobacco
finish
heck
of
a
beer
i
recommend
it
yet
another
nice
find
at
my
place
in
newtown
ct
this
cask
ale
presents
a
pale
clear
amber
color
with
a
fair
bigbubbled
head
that
dies
pretty
quickly
with
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
dank
wheat
with
a
slight
herbal
hop
highlight
not
thrilling
but
theres
hope
the
taste
offers
a
creamy
citrus
bite
nothing
harsh
but
reasonable
in
typical
english
style
very
modest
carbonation
its
a
very
nice
blend
of
citrus
and
floral
bread
a
near
full
feel
very
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
the
hops
seem
to
build
as
you
go
a
very
decent
brew
search
this
out
youd
be
happy
you
did
conclusion
this
is
a
pretty
decent
english
bitter
light
smooth
tasty
but
a
little
bit
over
simple
the
hoppiness
and
dry
feel
stayed
into
the
aftertaste
a
good
bottled
beer
going
through
my
fridge
i
found
i
had
2
bottles
of
this
beer
and
they
are
consistent
if
not
what
i
was
looking
for
i
appropriately
let
them
sit
out
to
warm
up
before
opening
them
poured
from
the
bottle
this
beer
has
a
hazy
pale
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
leaving
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
slight
but
i
detected
some
citrus
the
taste
is
surprisingly
watery
but
has
a
slight
citrus
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
like
the
beer
is
light
i
was
expecting
something
bolder
especially
as
this
was
the
1998
champion
bitter
at
the
great
british
beer
fest
its
probably
awesome
on
cask
but
this
version
leaves
me
cold
taste
of
bitter
hops
toffee
touch
of
citrus
nice
dry
finish
and
nicely
bitter
i
have
no
clue
as
to
the
age
of
this
bottle
other
than
i
notice
some
haziness
with
the
second
pour
and
some
floaties
ok
another
brew
from
the
uk
that
obviously
isnt
in
its
peak
condition
and
i
guess
im
getting
used
to
that
by
now
thats
a
pity
because
even
though
i
know
that
its
well
past
its
optimum
state
i
still
find
it
tasty
and
very
drinkable
a
fresh
sample
would
probably
make
me
really
go
gaga
mfd
thinmedium
bodies
ale
imo
way
too
much
sediment
at
least
in
the
bottle
i
sampled
noting
special
here
at
all
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
a
well
crafted
english
bitter
from
a
well
kept
cask
one
of
those
things
in
life
that
i
really
appreciate
this
beer
was
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
imperial
pint
glass
with
a
delicate
white
lacy
head
and
a
glowing
golden
orange
hue
there
was
a
bit
more
sediment
than
expected
strong
floral
and
citrus
sent
with
hints
of
apple
pears
and
kiwis
good
body
not
to
much
hop
thickness
and
the
lemoney
citric
zest
just
zips
off
your
tounge
then
finnishs
with
a
subtle
hint
of
grapefruit
pours
a
slightly
fogged
gold
with
a
good
sized
crème
head
that
leaves
a
mass
of
lace
on
the
way
down
and
oops
i
got
some
sediment
in
the
glass
nose
is
pretty
mild
really
not
much
going
on
except
slight
bitter
tone
and
a
mild
hop
flavor
is
an
english
bitter
for
sure
smooth
and
consistent
but
not
very
exciting
really
feel
has
a
thicker
body
to
the
liquid
with
an
odd
sticky
texture
to
it
decent
enough
carbonation
drinkable
sure
it
is
a
good
beer
but
for
the
price
a
bit
too
high
for
one
bottle
i
have
to
say
especially
for
not
having
any
wild
character
about
it
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
huge
head

some
sedimentation
noted
even
though
i
poured
carefully
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
fruity
the
taste
is
spicy
and
bitter
hops
are
noticeable
as
well
as
some
slight
fruit
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
and
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
this
beer
finishes
dry
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
would
be
good
for
sessions
lightbodied
appley
malt
with
a
resinous
base
and
in
the
finish
a
lingering
grapefruit
that
you
can
chew
on
long
after
the
last
sip
drinkabily
high
this
is
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
and
sometimes
my
prejudice
for
and
against
english
bitters
compels
me
to
usually
rate
their
beers
quaint
and
unremarkable
however
this
one
does
stick
out
for
me
maybe
its
been
a
while
since
ive
sampled
many
beers
of
the
style
but
this
one
was
either
quite
fresh
or
just
beautifully
made
or
both
this
one
youd
want
to
sip
on
a
warm
day
preferably
riverside
in
an
easy
chair
watching
the
stream
roll
down
the
horizon

and

there
it

this
is
an

and
uninteresting
bitter
d
highly
drinkable
very
enjoyable
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
really
like
md
besides
the
fine
carbonation
the
phenomenal
bitterness
helps
result
in
a
3d

palate
throughout
this
is
a

reasonably
flavoursome
and
really
really
bitter
bitter
not
as
colourful
and
soft
as
the
caskconditioned
version
though
which
is
one
of
my
favourite
bitters
on
cask
but
still
this
bottleconditioned
version
scores
high
in
my
book
recommended
poured
a
clear
deep
golden
with
a
light
orange
hue
with
a
huge
blooming
foamy
white
head
that
slowly
crept
its
way
down
but
took
quite
some
time
for
it
to
settle
aromas
are
clean
i
think
to
clean
a
little
caramel
note
and
a
light
passing
herbal
note
but
it
was
faint
its
a
sessional
style
beer
no
doubt
light
toastedcaramel
sweet
malt
but
nothing
overbearing
finishing
with
a
light
lemonherbalness
it
is
what
it
is
a
light
bitter
a
good
quaffer
just
very
subtle
flavors
i
will
definately
drink
it
againespecially
if
someone
else
is
buying
overall
seems
to
suit
the
style
just
fine
worth
a
try
a
dry
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
bitter
almost
lagerlike
when
decanted
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
i
would
search
out
more
and
would
love
to
try
it
a
the
source
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
slightly
dry
yet
fruity
english
yeast
aroma
its
bitter
with
noble
hops
quite
nice
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
very
bitter
hop
flavor
that
is
way
over
the
top
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
flavor
but
there
is
no
real
balance
here
it
has
a
powerful
grapefruit
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
an
average
bitter
its
way
too
over
the
top
for
me
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
citrus
hops
its
one
and
done
for
me
another
english
ale
that
pours
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
probably
because
it
bottleconditioned
this
bitter
pours
with
a
beautifully
rocky
head
that
slowly
falls
leaving
thick
lacing
theres
just
a
little
bit
of
a
saltine
cracker
aroma
a
fairly
fullbodied
bitter
with
a
straightforward
maltiness
not
complex
and
hearty
bitter
finish
nothing
terribly
complex
here
just
a
very
refreshing
bitter
ale
perhaps
a
bit
too
clean
for
the
style
but
a
good
quencher
and
certainly
bitter
enough
the
bottle
mentions
adding
the
yeast
to
the
bottle
for
a
fuller
flavour
low
in
alcohol
and
sharp
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
light
of
the
numerous
american
ales
that
cross
my
path
because
of
the
higher
carbonation
and
slightly
medicinal

this

public

pours
an
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
subdued
but
with
all
the
rest
of
the
beers
on
the
menu
rides
long
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
mouth
taste
well
there
it
is
not
very
rebellious
just
a
decent
bitter
smooth
slightly
fruity
with
that
lightly
lingering
hoppiness

the

taste
is
very

good

with
some

in

bitterness
is
there
in
good
quantity
for
a
bitter
mellow
and
inviting
nice
length
and

characteristics
lingers
nicely
quite
a
nice
taster
i
nearly
forgot
it
was
a
bitter
it
came
into
an
ipa
quality
of
some
english
variants
ive
had
so
that
impressed
me
solid
medium
body
creamy
good
bittering
hops
and
malty
sweet
backing
a
fine
drinker
really
became
easy
to
down
as
it
warmed

was

very
pale

conditioned
and
very
drinkable
i
have
never
come
across
any
rch
beers
on
cask
in
the
u
k
but
ill
try
looking
harder
next
time
interesting
label
with
a
small
portrait
of
i
believe
king
james
ii
on
it
thanks
again
to
rkhaze
for
thinking
of
me
on
his
latest
beer
trip
it
is
smooth
with
a
nice
crisp
start
the
hops
are
pretty
kicking
in
this
one
it
seems
to
have
some
hop
character
from
an
american
pale
mixed
with
a
british
bitter
grains
are
an
outstnading
partner
to
balance
this
one
it
has
just
enough
bitterness
and
sweetness
to
come
together
drinkability
is
excellent
and
although
this
was
missing
a
little
bit
of
that
nice
earthy
cask
flavor
it
was
nice
none
the
less
16
9
ounce
bottle
lovely
stuff
a
decent
session
bitter
in
my
books
drinkability

the
low
abv
actually
helped
this
one
go
down
pretty
well
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
rch
pitchfork
on
cask
at
the
raf
yellow
color
tending
toward
hazy
the
head
was
as
expected
light
with
large
bubbles
nice
sweet
aroma
somewhat
grassy
taste
is
not
at
all
what
i
had
hoped
for
to
me
this
is
very
musty
with
heavy
horse
blankethayvegetable
tastes
a
hand
full
of
crackers
and
a
sip
of
water
did
not
improve
the
taste
the
program
stated
that
this
was
a
grand
champion
but
to
me
it
was
the
worst
of
the
lot
a
clear
light
copper
with
absolutely
no
head
but
then
again
its
cask
conditioned
what
else
do
you
expect
actually
id
like
to
see
even
a
hint
of
carbonation
on
this
nada
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
with
a
perfumy
hop
presence
herbal
and
fruity
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
between
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
and
bitter
and
spicy
some
fruit
flavors
are
in
the
finish
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
nicely
done
bitter
that
i
would
recommend
on
cask
a
nice
hazy
ambergold
colored
brew
nice
head
with
solid
but
not
really
impressive
retention
very
earthy
herbal
aroma
flavor
full
of
herbal
grassy
hops
and
balanced
nicely
with
sweet
malt
fairly
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
nice
bitter
hoppy
finish
refreshing
brew
that
i
plan
on
having
again
before
it
disappears
from
the
indy
beer
scene
o
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
balanced
even
if
a
slight
bit
dry
not
bad
a
decent
bitter
as
the
label
says
a
classic
slightly
sweet
with
subtle
flavours
that
blend
well
but
its
a
bit
boring
if
something
more
exciting
was
on
offer
then
id
probably
pass
this
over
still
decent
enough
but
it
aint
adnamss
extra
is
it
food
match
i
would
match
this
with
a
pie
or
cornish
pastie
some
mash
potatoes
with
gravy
or
tomato
sauce
and
peas
a
classic
english
meal
for
a
classic
english
bitters
o
a
classic
british
bitter
pimped
with
an
extra
0
8
abv
to
suit
local
alcohol
habits
or
something
like
that
its
got
just
enough
creamy
caramel
flavours
and
just
that
amount
of
body
and
bitterness
not
too
light
not
too
much
to
be
a
great
session
beer
now
i
feel
like
having
fish
and
chips
or
beans
on
toast
flavour
is
citrus
and
hop
loads
of
grapefruit
bitterness
quite
boozy
and
drinkability
is
compromised
by
this
some
grassiness
and
subdued
breadiness
i
was
a
little
disturbed
by
a
slight
soapy
taste
that
bothered
e
when
i
identified
it
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
average
bitter
a
very
meh
drink
overall
i
would
order
it
again
if
there
were
no
other
ales
but
i
would
always
choose
somthing
like
doom
bar
over
this
picked
this
up
at
the
biggest
beer
store
in
the
uk
beers
of
europe
ltd
clear
ambercopper
pour
with
quickly
fading
two
finger
head
and
nice
lacing
pretty
typical
english
bitter
nose
with
lots
of
biscuity
malt
subdued
fruity
herbal
hops
and
a
strong
aroma
of
tea
and
rye
bread
the
taste
follows
suit
with
fruity
herbal
tea
and
bitter
hops
up
front
balanced
nicely
by
solid
bready
nutty
caramel
malt
with
hints
of
vanilla
rye
bread
and
a
touch
of
metal
smooth
bitter
finish
and
the
low
abv
make
this
pretty
drinkable
ive
heard
a
lot
about
adnams
and
theyre
a
solid
brewery
but
still
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
to
me
dr
low
abv
good
taste
an
excellent
session
beer
d
quite
a
drinkable
standard
mild
english
bitter
soft
low
carbonation
smooth
medium
body
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
a
mild
but
pleasant
english
bitter
not
a
very
robust
one
but
its
nice
enough
of
all
the
english
beers
i
had
on
my
recent
visit
to
london
this
was
probably
one
of
my
favorites
very
bright
light
color
good
carbonation
refreshing
especially
for
an
english
draft
ale
and
quite
a
nice
thing
in
the
afternoon
perhaps
it
was
partially
the
difference
between
draft
and
cask
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
all
week
in
bottle
28513
raspberry
nose
more
red
berry
up
front
with
woody
hops
and
some
chew
a
very
fruity
bitter
makes
fuggles
palatable
though
past
date
ill
taste
this
fresh
some
day
overall
more
than
avrage
bitter
but
not
really
a
favorite
this
would
have
been
quite
good
if
not
for
the
dodgy
finish
this
bitter
is
easy
to
drink
and
more
or
less
the
one
i
most
often
have
in
stock
oh
and
for
those
confused
about
the
abv
the
cask
version
is
3

the
bottle
is

i
got
this
info
from
the
adnams
website
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
from
adnams
tasty
but
very
easy
to
drink
at
the
same
time
could
be
a
very
good
session
brew
the
carbonation
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
but
this
is
definitely
a
nice
session
beer
d
this
is
a
great
bitter
nice
mix
of
light
roasted
malts
together
with
bitter
hops
and
citric
notes
finishes
of
with
a
really
long
nice
aftertaste
this
one
is
great
a
joy
to
hold
and
drink
something
almost
clashes
here
but
ends
up
with
a
refreshing
quality
caramelly
with
an
herbal
dryness
it
does
have
a
certain
drinkable
smoothness
to
it
would
definitely
drink
again
pours
a
dark
amber
orange
with
thick
foam
white
head
nice
delicate
hop
aroma
balanced
by
a
slightly
malty
bacbone
very
smooth
and
refreshing
ale
with
floral
and
citrus
hops
making
it
quite
crisp
nicely
balanced
with
a
slight
dry
finish
good
drinkable
brew
the
aroma
is
simple
toasted
malt
and
grassy
hops
the
appearance
is
deep
amber
with
a
medium
foamy
tan
head
the
flavor
is
hops
toasted
malt
and
nuts
and
some
toffee
the
palate
is
fitting
for
a
bitter
the
aftertaste
has
an
astringent
bitterness
that
reminds
me
of
soap
otherwise
its
not
too
bad
too
thin
just
pretty
bad
overall
the
regular
adnams
bitter
a
lighter
version
of
the
estimable
broadside
many
a
long
night
in
an
aldeburgh
pub
and
several
pints
of
this
fine
bitter
punctuated
my
university
career
dark
amber
and
moderate
sudsy
head
appear
on
first
pouring
lowish
in
alcohol
but
not
concomitantly
low
in
flavour
malty
fruity
slight
hop
aroma
good
body
eminently
drinkable
earlier
i
didnt
really
esteem
the
ales
of
adnams
i
thought
they
were
too
chemical
and
dry
but
i
think
that
they
have
been
served
too
cold
at
circa
10
c
50
f
it
really
opens
up
i
will
try
it
again
when
im
not
having
a
cold
im
sure
this
is
a
real
winner
on
cask
a
very
drinkable
and
flavourful
bitter
this
is
just
the
way
a
bitter
should
taste
and
feel
to
my
opinion
very
drinkable
session
type
brew
finally
had
this
beer
in
a
pub
in
hampstead
adnams
bitter
is
a
deep
and
clear
amber
topped
by
a
nicely
formed
head
lacing
is
scattered
but
nice
herbal
hop
aroma
is
followed
by
a
zingy
sharp
hop
blast
that
is
also
herbal
and
a
bit
fruity
finish
is
long
tingly
mouth
feel
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
while
relaxing
and
it
is
quite
refreshing
mouthfeel
medium
body
pert
carbonation
crisp
slight
astringency
i
may
well
buy
a
few
more
bottles
the
pint
went
down
very
well
and
had
i
bought
any
more
i
would
have
drunk
these
on
the
same
night
this
is
one
that
will
definately
retain
a
place
in
the
beer
cupboard
i
would
be
very
keen
to
try
this
on
cask
im
not
sure
if
i
should
use
bitters
on
tap
as
a
reference
in
rating
this
beer
i
think
bitters
need
to
be
carbonated
but
not
overly
carbonated
like
the
can
version
i
had
it
kind
of
puts
it
in
another
style
or
substyle
so
to
speak
in
any
case
adnams
bitter
filled
my
glass
with
an
inviting
chestnut
colored
brew
lots
of
bubbles
and
some
good
foam
straight
out
of
the
can
it
produced
a
smell
of
hops
and
metal
after
a
while
it
became
floral
too
the
first
taste
was
of
sweet
caramel
and
bitterness
tadam
this
was
followed
by
a
hint
of
licorice
and
dryness
refreshing
im
happy
with
it
medium
bitterness
overall
a
very
good
beer
recommended
md
quite
smooth
on
the
palate
albeit
not
without
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
the
flavour
is
rather
rich
against
its
overall
light
body
a
very
very
tasty
and
moreish
session
beer
malt
caramel
bread
type
of
aroma
medium
brown
body
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
hue
light
tan
head
about
a
half
inch
or
so
to
start
and
settles
relatively
quick
to
a
light
film
mild
sweet
fruit
and
malt
taste
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
touch
of
apple
like
crispness
has
a
full
thick
feel
balanced
and
pleasant
english
bitter
with
high
drinkability
the
warmer
the
better
after
drinking
the
style
often
they
grow
on
you
i
hope
i
could
get
decent
local
offerings
for
the
style
for
the
right
price
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
havent
had
many
english
bitters
so
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
compare
it
to
would
have
rated
higher
if
not
for
the
steely
hop
character
pours
a
deep
reddishamber
in
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
for
the
most
part
english
malts
with
a
hint
of
fruit
the
taste
is
the
sweet
malt
right
up
front
followed
by
a
hint
of
fruit
and
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
which
wasnt
hoppy
though
actually
very
tasty
as
i
have
never
had
this
type
of
brew
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
liked
this
one
and
this
style
of
brew
5
litre
cask
from
brewery
shop
containing
live
yeast
poured
amber
clear
with
reasonably
lasting
head
aroma
sulphur
and
hop
taste
apple
sulphur
treacle
mouthfeel
light
overall
great
character
in
this
bitter
overall
a
very
typical
bitter
nothing
to
get
excited
about
and
probably
not
something
i
could
pick
out
of
a
blind
taste
test
against
other
similar
bitters
however
a
reasonably
good
beer
overall
this
bitter
got
off
to
a
slow
start
for
me
but
i
find
it
growing
on
me
a
nicely
quaffable
beverage
an
easy
beer
to
drink
a
classic
english
bitter
flavor
nice
balance
of
caramel
and
toasted
malt
flavors
with
peppery
and
earthy
hop
presence
overall
an
excellent
session
ale
i
could
drink
these
all
day
overall
certainly
not
the
most
exciting
beerstyle
by
todays
standards
but
its
something
that
i
always
appreciate
and
can
really
hit
the
spot
given
the
occasion
like
a
halfliter
with
lunch
for
example
o
requisite
pale
ale
flavors
with
a
solid
satisfying
hop
bitterness
a
tasty
beer
and
id
like
another
doesnt
quite
match
the
magnificence
of
draft
broadside
but
ill
take
it
lots
of
flavours
for
a
4
1
beer
and
good
balance
too
d
off
the
charts
drinkable
one
of
the
best
pints
i
had
in
london
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
of
brown
sugar
and
toasted
grain
taste
begins
with
some
big
tea
leaf
flavor
then
some
rye
bread
and
finishes
with
some
leafy
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
great
overall
an
excellent
bitter
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
alcohol
had
this
bitter
at
the
plough
in
london
near
the
british
museum
pours
a
beautiful
cooper
color
with
nice
white
head
some
lacing
in
the
glass
it
smelled
warm
and
toasty
it
tasted
so
easy
perfect
for
a
cool
fall
day
it
went
down
so
easy
the
perfect
session
beer
tasted
of
a
nice
glass
of
milk
i
drank
3
pints
no
problems
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
bitters
out
there
a
decent
bitter
if
a
tad
unexciting
would
be
nice
if
the
hop
aroma
was
more
prominent
but
overall
this
is
balanced
and
wellcrafted
a
easygoing
ale
that
would
be
perfect
for
sessioning
worth
sampling
if
you
see
it
overall
bottle
claims
the
adnams
brewery
of
the
year
in
2011
with
offerings
like
this
you
can
see
how
theyve
earned
that
distinction
overall
a
good
english
bitter
but
not
quite
up
to
the
fullers
level
still
i
love
this
style
and
would
really
like
to
sample
this
out
of
a
cask
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
enjoyed
while
eating
my
malaysian
dinner
the
other
night
it
is
extremely
drinkable
never
boring
and
just
a
quality
example
of
an
english
bitter
one
of
the
top
ones
ive
had
in
the
us
for
sure
it
lacks
the
spoiled
old
oxidized
flavors
many
english
imports
have
which
was
very
pleasing
500
ml
bottle
pours
amber
with
a
medium
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
caramel
malt
and
ripe
fruit
body
is
medium
and
tangy
earthy
hops
followed
by
caramel
malt
and
some
fruit
on
the
palate
finish
is
long
and
earthy
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
this
brew
taste
is
wonderful
juicy
faintly
winy
toast
tea
woodytoasty
bitter
finish
after
a
sweeter
start
it
is
lively
and
engaging
juicy
and
appetizing
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
are
gentle
and
balanced
but
firm
and
it
leans
slightly
to
the
bitter
side
in
a
lean
finish
a
soso
bitter
not
really
up
to
the
spec
of
a
fullers
or
john
smiths
with
an
off
kilter
and
overly
dominant
fruit
nature
good
for
one
i
suppose
and
then
its
simply
time
for
something
else
light
body
big
malt
profile
toasted
grain
on
the
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
butteryness
hops
come
through
flavor
wise
but
theres
not
a
ton
of
bitterness
lots
of
balance
a
little
thin
and
watery
but
it
has
good
flavor
a
nice
balance
of
complex
malts
and
noble
hops
bold
for
a
session
brew
but
the
water
like
body
takes
away
from
it
a
bit
smells
of
buttery
toasted
bread
with
a
light
fig
jam
spread
on
top
the
sip
however
is
markedly
sharp
and
bitter
with
an
initial
attack
of
strong
herbalwoody
and
medium
earthen
hopping
over
biscuit
malts
with
another
garnish
of
fig
jam
it
is
very
much
drier
and
bitter
on
the
tongue
than
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
and
im
liking
it
very
much
im
not
normally
a
big
fan
of
diacetyl
but
somehow
this
beer
has
managed
to
have
a
reasonable
modicum
of
butter
in
the
aroma
but
hardly
any
at
all
present
in
the
flavor
which
works
out
for
the
best
imo
well
worth
trying
and
quite
sessionable
overall
better
than
i
though
the
herbal
earthy
grassy
hops
dont
really
turn
me
off
and
in
fact
bring
some
interesting
characters
that
im
actually
enjoying
this
beer
a
nice
malty
balance
that
adds
an
interesting
softness
to
it
which
could
be
the
water
pours
a
deep
amber
with
orange
hues
capped
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
great
retention
and
a
noticeable
amount
of
spider
web
like
lacing
pleasant
aroma
of
apple

notes
on
the
nose
apple

pear
a
touch
of
almond
and
biscuit
notes
joined
by

finishes
with
a
restrained

slick

by

this
is
a

beer
with

great
taste
and

pretty
good

at
a
good

with

are
good

is
like
flavor
of
average
length
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
likable
for
the
style
some
flaws
but
easy
to
overlook
this
is
a
smooth
drink
rich
and
lowly
carbonated
more
bitterness
than
the
smell
would
suggest
plenty
of
toasted

but
it
isnt
too

and
some

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a

of

on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
smell
is
pretty
lacking
in
my
opinion
o
a
tasty
drinkable
pint
this
is
a
good
one
havent
had
a
new
british
beer
in
a
while
and
this
didnt
disappoint
i
can
only
imagine
its
even
better
on
cask
a
satisfying
fun
pint
the
ale
has
an
overall
very
approachable
and
masculine
quality
although
its
difficult
to
celebrate
an
one
attribute
its
the
balance
that
makes
it
so
charming
and
comfortable
its
nice
to
come
across
a
bitter
stateside
even
better
to
come
across
one
that
has
held
up
on
the
voyage
acorss
the
ocean
pleasant
mix
of
flavors
here
overall
a
real
mellow
and
chewy
classic
bitter
that
is
worth
seeking
out
overall
drinkability
quite
drinkable
and
i
think
a
good
example
of
an
english
bitter
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
another
one
like
all
english
ales
needs
to
warm
up
for
a
bit
after
coming
out
of
the
fridge
before
you
get
all
the
flavors
and
the
real
character
of
the
beer
o
this
beer
is
quite
flavorful
given
its
low
alcohol
content
which
makes
it
rather
sessionable

the

has
to
offer

this

im
sure
is
supreme

overall
a

it
is

it
isi
could

alot
of
these
over
a
long
period
of
time
in
a
session
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
in
this
category
and
a
good
one
to
drink
to
get
introduced
to
bitters
however
to
me
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
a
prominent
second
note
beyond
the
bitterness
there
really
isnt
much
else
to
it
this
is
not
a
bad
bitter
the
abv
is
nice
and
low
and
drinkabilty
as
far
as
said
abv
goes
is
great
the
flavours
just
dont
mesh
as
well
for
me
as
i
hoped
overall
enjoyably
subtle
the
beer
pours
clear
and
amber
the
color
of
freshly
oiled
mahogany
the
head
is
a
thick
lip
of
fine
khaki
bubbles
the
beer
doesnt
quite
achieve
the
look
of
a
handpumped
pint
and
the
head
quickly
thins
to
a
stubborn
few
millimeters
the
aroma
is
freshly
baked
pastries
laced
with
hop
nectar
the
caramel
malt
backbone
is
quite
rich
for
the
strength
of
the
beer
and
holds
up
the
hops
well
the
hops
are
rather
fruity
peaches
nectarines
meyer
lemons
and
a
hint
of
pineapple
with
touches
of
mineral
notes
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
and
there
isnt
quite
enough
to
the
hops
to
pull
it
together
the
caramel
malt
verges
on
sickly
medicinal
sweetness
though
its
certainly
not
a
fatal
flaw
in
my
estimation
carbonation
is
low
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
but
its
a
pale
imitation
of
a
cask
its
hardly
the
fault
of
adnams
id
just
love
to
try
more
english
ales
fresh
out
of
a
cask
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
once
again
am
amazed
at
how
much
flavor
english
brewers
can
pack
into
5
abv
beers
of
course
not
having
sampled
the
casks
of
england
i
really
have
no
idea
how
it
compares
to
the
style
perhaps
if
i
was
surrounded
by
bitters
i
wouldnt
praise
it
so
highly
but
thats
an
issue
for
another
day
notes
had
my
1st
two
adnams
beers
today
and
their
is
a
bitterness
which
i
find
not
at
all
pleasing
pity
as
i
was
excited
to
try
some
new
english
beer
the
taste
has
a
more
piney
flavor
than
the
aroma
lets
on
with
some
gentle
bitterness
which
has
a
more
herbal
taste
w
gentle
pepper
tinge
and
accent
with
more
yeast
which
brings
a
light
alcohol
flavor
and
subtle
mineral
tinge
w
a
dry
finish
the
overall
is
a
highly
drinkable
bitter
very
quaffable
i
would
order
this
again
as
it
is
pretty
full
of
flavor
for
a
3
7
beer
very
sessionable
a
nice
relaxing
ale
the
can
bought
in
sweden
says
4
1
abv
o
as
stated
above
there
is
nothing
amazing
or
outstanding
about
this
but
it
is
a
fairly
solid
offering
and
very
representative
of
the
style
o
an
uneven
beer
the
taste
is
a
little
to
mild
but
nice
the
aftertaste
is
the
best
ive
had
in
a
canned
bitter
cheers
im
done
giving
this
beer
another
shot

very

fuggles
palatable
though
past
date
ill
taste
this
fresh
some
day
mostly
clear
amber
body
topped
with
a
nice
head
of
fluffy
foam
that
coated
the
glass
on
the
way
down
smooth
as
silk
with
a
nice
malty
character
and
hints
of
the
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
smooth
and
rich
with
a
medium
body
this
bitter
poured
a
very
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
flat
the
smell
was
minimal
malt
with
a
trace
of
sulfur
the
taste
was
malty
with
mild
hops
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
a
tad
chalky
bready
quite
dry
aftertaste
and
quite
reminiscent
of
caffreys
and
boddingtonss
cask
beers
but
you
get
both
malts
and
hops
in
it
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
at
first
o
this
would
be
an
ideal
beer
to
drink
on
a
deck
under
the
hot
sun
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
good
bit
of
thick
offwhite
head
that
falls
and
leaves
a
solid
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
faint
led
by
a
sweet
toasted
biscuit
malt
character
hop
aroma
comes
through
as
slightly
lemon
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
dry
cracker
malt
taste
and
a
grass
and
lemon
hop
profile
it
has
a
light
to
medium
body
and
rounds
out
with
a
clean
dryness
aided
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
a
very
delicately
balanced
beer
with
nothing
standing
out
or
seeming
to
compete
with
any
of
its
other
flavors
nothing
spectacular
but
refreshingly
clean
and
a
well
made
example
of
the
style
o
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
its
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
very
sessionable
the
bitterness
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
underlying
malts
notes
a
great
bitter
lots
of
funkiness
and
character
good
stuff
o
i
am
beginning
to
love
these
english
style
lower
abv
with
subtle
hop
flavors
playing
off
the
subtle
malt
flavors
at
times
these
beers
become
less
is
more
this
beer
was
awesome
very
nuanced
and
complex
in
its
own
way
i
truly
enjoyed
it
and
wish
that
i
could
get
it
on
cask
or
in
a
6
or
12
pack
i
just
want
to
have
bunch
of
pints
a
very
good
session
beer
sometime
this
is
all
you
need
in
a
beer
a
decent
bitter
with
a
great
aroma
nice
use
of
aromatic
hops
while
the
malt
and
bitterness
are
well
balanced
live
yeast
adds
depth
to
the
flavour
drinkable
and
worth
sampling
this
beer
was
pumped
out
of
a
cask
the
color
was
a
golden
yellow
and
it
had
a
thin
white
head
on
it
there
wasnt
much
lacing
at
all
the
smell
was
grainy
and
had
a
subtle
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
mild
upfront
and
finished
with
a
nice
dry
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
watery
overall
its
a
decent
bitter
but
nothing
too
great
d
really
drinkable
i
wish
this
was
more
widely
available
and
on
tap
d
nice
english
session
brew
worth
trying
but
not
world
class
could
easily
down
a
few
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
in
a
highly
drinkable
style
m
d
very
light
and
drinkable
nice
malt
backbone
and
good
hop
finish
i
should
have
bought
two
this
goes
down
easy
slainte
bright
orange
and
a
bit
hazy
with
a
short
lasting
head
some
shortlived
lacing
too
malty
and
biscuity
aroma
hops
were
grassy
and
a
bit
citrusy
a
bit
floral
bitterness
was
solid
throughout
more
biscuity
malt
citrus
and
floral
hop
flavours
lingered
it
was
perhaps
a
bit
too
dry
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
i
quite
liked
the
flavour
profile
of
this
beer
slightly
less
attenuation
would
help
make
it
more
drinkable
and
well
rounded
drinkability
great
drinkability
and
why
the
hell
not
low
in
alcohol
and
plenty
of
flavour
whats
not
to
like
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
than
1
bottle
perhaps
the
only
issue
is
6
a
pint
there
are
a
lot
of
fine
beers
out
there
on
which
i
can
drop
6
so
this
one
has
a
lot
of
competition
drinkability
a
sufficient
decently
refreshing
though
not
exemplary
brew
its
certainly
more
appealing
than
all
that
goofball
xmas
stuff
their
churn
out
at
years
end
not
overly
impressed
to
be
honest
pleased
it
wasnt
a
pint
bottle
d
very
drinkable
and
would
like
to
put
down
a
few
later
if
readily
available
d
a
delicious
and
sessionworthy
bitter
i
wish
it
was
cheaper
came
in
six
packs
and
easier
to
find
i
wish
that
we
had
more
good
english
bitters
and
milds
sold
in
this
country
this
beer
is
pleasantly
light
with
a
clean
fresh
flavor
it
would
make
for
an
excellent
session
beer
it
pours
a
bright
light
orange
with
dark
yellow
highlights
and
a
wonderfully
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
citric
with
an
excellent
light
malt
presence
while
its
very
wellbalanced
there
is
still
a
noticeable
hop
focus
the
feel
is
soft
and
creamy
with
gentle
bitterness
i
imagine
that
its
great
from
the
cask
drinkability
is
very
good
from
the
1
pt
9
fl
oz
bottle
no
f10077
sampled
on
april
30
2009
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copperyellow
with
a
modest
creamy
offwhite
head
it
is
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
so
the
cloudiness
is
not
unexpected
the
aroma
is
fresh
and
grassy
with
a
little
dab
of
hops
it
is
not
an
offensive
aroma
but
i
think
i
expected
something
a
little
more
it
feels
lie
honey
on
the
tongue
but
it
has
nothing
resembling
that
in
the
taste
the
taste
is
nice
and
bitter
with
a
hint
of
something
tart
taking
up
the
rear
a
pretty
good
english
bitter
i
had
this
417
at
deks
gravity
firkin
it
appeared
to
be
a
light
golden
color
in
my
pint
and
the
slight
aroma
of
vanilla
and
fruit
elements
came
to
mind
it
was
lighter
than
i
expected
and
a
little
watery
with
slight
floral
hops
in
the
nose
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
as
we
joked
about
the
hole
in
my
pint
glass
i
liked
the
low
abv
as
it
provided
a
relief
from
the
higher
ones
like
dfh
90
which
i
had
after
wards
i
hope
to
try
the
bottle
version
soon
to
test
the
differences
conclusion
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
what
but
this
was
incredibly
unsorted
and
just
plain
weird
i
poured
23
of
it
down
the
drain
and
thats
sacrilege
for
me
an
easydrinking
ale
with
a
nice
subtle
wellbalanced
flavour
a
bittering
touch
in
the
finish
could
see
myself
drinking
plenty
of
this
oncask
in
an
english
pub
overall
lacks
a
muchneeded
pronounced
bite
started
off
ok
at
first
but
at
the
end
i
found
myself
having
trouble
finishing
the
overexcessive
22oz
bottle
had
a
bottle
at
moan
and
dove
a
murky
orange
look
with
some
patchy
lacing
throughout
drinking
generally
thin
head
citrus
orange
flavors
are
weakly
permeated
from
the
drink
enough
to
be
apparent
but
nothing
too
strong
a
dull
bitter
taste
with
a
decently
bready
flavoring
in
the
taste
department
it
was
incredibly
refreshing
though
with
a
great
crispness
to
it
overall
a
bit
too
uneven
but
still
decent
light
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
to
match
this
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
save
for
the
price
a
great
session
ale
overall
an
easy
drinker
light
bodied
and
easy
to
put
back
a
few
but
a
little
thin
in
flavor
doesnt
really
stand
out
as
anything
superb
but
still
a
good
beer
to
spend
a
bit
with
overall
a
solid
bitter
not
the
best
in
the
world
but
id
have
it
again
on
tap
i
may
pick
up
a
bottle
somewhere
again
if
the
price
is
right
the
taste
is
bready
malt
up
front
with
mild
sweetness
mildly
bitter
hoppiness
with
light
citrus
mostly
lemon
and
hints
of
herbsleaves
and
pine
rapidly
complement
this
before
a
hoppy
floral
finish
leaving
a
pleasant
floral
atfrertaste
with
hints
of
bread
lemon
and
honey
its
crisp
and
lively
yet
still
has
a
fairly
fullbodied
feel
it
is
very
refreshing
smooth
balanced
exceedingly
drinkable
and
satisfying
an
easygoing
ale
that
i
could
drink
just
about
any
time
of
day
poured
a
dark
gold
with
almost
no
head
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
there
was
a
large
hint
of
sulfur
in
the
scent
that
mostly
covered
up
the
hoppiness
of
the
beer
it
had
a
bitterhoppy
taste
but
it
too
was
covered
up
with
a
sulfuregg
flavor
yes
i
checked
it
had
not
expired
it
was
fairly
smoothly
but
not
close
to
the
best
bottle
or
even
bottleconditioned
english
bitter
ive
ever
had
this
brew
is
refreshing
and
clean
very
bitter
with
malt
that
will
stand
up
to
it
but
not
a
malt
lovers
bitter
hopheads
should
try
it
but
i
wont
pay
6
bucks
for
it
again
i
dont
believe
very
nice
and
a
good
example
of
an
english
bitter
full
flavored
light
bodied
and
with
a
low
abv
this
could
easily
keep
me
entertained
at
the
bar
for
hours
dexcellent
true
to
style
very
solid
and
totally
quaffable
could
easliy
sit
at
the
pub
and
drink
this
pint
after
pint
d
certainly
drinkable
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
compared
to
other
cask
offerings
ive
had
very
thin
body
but
had
a
nice
mild
flavor
pretty
good
just
a
little
sour
for
my
taste
to
be
truly
great
that
drying
ability
though
is
wonderful
i
would
drink
this
again
for
that
great
sensation
alone
this
is
a
very
classic
british
style
bitter
it
pours
a
deep
almost
orangish
color
with
a
slight
bit
of
haze
this
is
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
but
it
doesnt
have
the
yeasty
bits
floating
about
nor
any
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
head
is
off
white
and
doesnt
retain
all
that
well
the
smell
is
malty
some
piney
hop
notes
and
a
bit
of
floral
aroma
too
the
taste
is
quite
dry
nicely
balanced
between
malts
and
hops
and
with
a
bit
of
a
minty
flavoring
as
well
the
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
fairly
light
bodied
and
very
refreshing
the
mouth
feel
is
very
watery
and
at
4
abv
you
can
drink
lots
of
this
beer
its
very
drinkable
enjoyable
and
well
worth
seeking
out
for
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
lchaim
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
much
more
so
than
i
was
expecting
would
make
a
great
session
beer
overall
i
was
quite
surprised
and
pleased
by
this
ridgeway
bitter
and
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
some
up
again
and
share
with
friends
drinkability
highly
refreshing
with
a
balanced
taste
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
all
night
d
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
in
any
number
of
situations
quite
easily
drinkable
i
wouldnt
mind
if
this
was
my
local
pubs
brew
this
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
generous
head
the
smell
is
yeasty
and
floral
with
a
crisp
end
the
taste
is
surprisingly
complex
for
a
bitter
it
starts
much
like
apple
juice
with
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
very
little
discernible
carbonation
as
it
goes
down
there
is
more
fruit
that
comes
to
the
forefront
like
pears
and
orange
the
after
taste
incorporates
the
same
yeastyness
that
was
in
the
smell
and
the
bitter
tongue
lingers
for
long
after
its
swallowed
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
great
thin
and
fizzy
in
the
mouth
high
carbonation
is
very
crisp
finishes
with
similar
flavors
good
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
mouthfeel
is
far
too
fizzy
and
overcarbonated
especially
for
the
style
really
hurts
the
overall
drinkability
of
the
brew
although
im
sure
ill
have
little
problem
finishing
the
pint
the
beer
poured
a
lifeless
copper
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
simply
of
light
malt
the
taste
was
of
light
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
better
in
the
finish
the
feel
was
medium
and
dry
this
one
started
off
a
bit
weak
but
as
i
drank
it
grew
on
me
and
was
suprisingly
good
a
very
delicate
beer
d
i
would
probably
prefer
this
more
if
it
were
fresher
d
good
thirst
quenching
english
bitter
easy
to
drink
but
with
enough
going
on
to
remaining
interesting
while
i
dont
love
ridgeway
bitter
as
much
as
i
love
ridgeway
ipa
once
a
hophead
always
a
hophead
its
a
beautiful
beer
that
is
the
very
definition
of
the
english
bitter
style
at
least
as
i
understand
it
i
would
dearly
love
to
work
my
way
through
a
succession
of
pints
oncask
of
course
during
a
warm
sunny
afternoon
in
oxfordshire
overall
a
very
interesting
english
pale
ale
the
marris
otter
malt
is
no
surprise
but
the
mix
of
challenger
and
boadicea
hops
most
certainly
is
solid
stuff
d
good
brew
doubt
i
would
get
it
again
unless
not
much
else
pours
transparent
brown
with
very
large
soapy
white
head
lots
of
small
bubbles
thin
lacing
smells
of
fresh
leafy
hops
and
light
caramel
malts
pleasing
combination
of
nuanced
flavors
caramel
malts
hard
mineral
water
slightly
dry
leafy
hops
and
lightly
toasted
biscuits
quite
light
and
strongly
carbonated
in
the
mouth
becoming
a
bit
creamy
and
chewy
as
it
warms
a
very
gentle
but
tasty
pint
that
makes
a
sociable
accompaniment
to
lunch
good
drinkability
a
unique
but
pleasant
bitter
11
2
oz
330
ml
light
malty
flavor
somewhat
herbal
and
possessing
an
oddly
astringent
character
theres
a
strange
bitterness
that
doesnt
come
across
as
hop
bitterness
the
beer
struck
me
as
strangely
dry
for
a
english
bitter
as
though
the
malt
couldnt
keep
up
with
some
of
the
other
nuanced
flavors
all
in
all
feels
a
bit
unbalanced
the
slight
tangy
sharpness
feels
at
odds
with
the
smooth
characteristics
that
i
expect
from
english
bitter
impeding
drinkability
served
from
a
500
ml
english
looking
bottle
in
appearance
this
is
a
dark
golden
ale
with
a
large
off
white
frothy
head
aroma
is
rather
subdued
slightly
earthy
maltiness
some
tinges
of
hoppiness
malty
earthy
tastes
dominate
then
a
slight
hoppy
tatse
and
a
longer
lasting
hop
after
tate
perhaps
from
the
fresh
hops
pretty
thin
on
the
palte
well
carbonated
a
good
drinkable
bitter
but
at
the
price
we
pay
over
here
i
could
not
say
it
was
a
session
ale
but
if
in
oxford
this
would
keep
my
intrest
for
several
pints
well
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
at
4
i
could
session
with
this
beer
easily
i
wonder
if
i
can
get
this
in
omaha
ive
seen
other
ridgeway
beers
anyway
i
really
like
the
simplicity
this
beer
offers
it
really
hit
the
spot
thank
you
daniel
for
the
bottle
i
liked
it
a
plenty
overall
this
is
just
what
i
was
wanting
tonight
a
flavorful
beer
thats
not
overpowering

not
high

perfect

would
be
the
perfect

this
is
a
very
mild
bitter
drinkability
the
light
body
and
crisp
maltiness
are
good
but
the
bitterness
seems
to
persist
just
a

for

pretty

it
just
doesnt

its

it
at

5
bucks
a
bottle
clear
bright
gold
a

stray

halfheartedly
trying
to
form
the
semblance
of
a
collar
leaving
the
beer
entirely
naked
after
a
couple
sips
nearly
no
aroma
probably
due
to
the
lack
of
head
a
vague
floral
melonish
fruity
whiff
what
is
there
is
decent
enough
the
flavor
opens
with
a
mild
very
easy
drinking
pale
maltiness
toasty
with
a
touch
of
minerally
flavor
and
a
bit
of
bacterial
funkiness
slightly
infected
cask
subtle
melonlike
fruit
easing
into
a
passive
floral
hop
finish
that
bit
of
funkiness
isnt
bad
but
the
slight
vague
sourness
in
the
finish
kinda
ruins
the
drinkability
for
me
its
such
a
delicate
beer
that
it
overpowers
the
other
flavors
very
easily
great
carbonation
level
just
a
soft
sparkle
pleasant
when
coupled
with
the
light
body
smooth
drinkin
stuff
light
yet
flavorful
this
is
what
session
ale
is
all
about
i
just
wish
it
were
a
bit
cleaner
ill
definitely
try
it
again
next
time
i
see
it

figure

this
comes
off
as

holds
ok
good
hoppiness
in
the

some
undertone

nice
disappointing
taste
very
thin
needed
alot
more
body
i
would
have
another
but
with
60
choices
on
tap
not
here
a
light
yellow
colored
beer
at
monks
hops
there
and
the
dryness
of
the
leaf
nutty
aroma
perhaps
the
glass
had
just
been
in
chlorine
taste
rather
off
strange
hops
and
herbal
flavor
of
a
tea
i
could
not
finish
the
sweetness
of
honey
and
malt
did
not
redeem
it
slick
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
a
pleasant
lightbodied
quaffable
session
ale
had
this
on
cask
the
other
night
the
brew
was
pulled
to
vibrant
golden
color
with
a
fairly
dense
white
head
that
had
pretty
good
retention
and
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
this
is
a
very
malty
beer
it
definitely
seems
to
dominate
but
i
am
able
to
pick
up
scents
of
hops
with
an
earthygrass
like
note
that
really
comingle
very
nicely
the
tastes
are
highlighted
by
a
malty
caramel
flavor
that
is
strongly
accented
by
a
hop
taste
that
seems
to
linger
a
bit
nice
brew
one
i
would
get
again
but
not
one
that
i
would
classify
as
exceptional
a
bit
watery
as
per
style
with
very
chalky
dryness
on
the
finish
a
classic
session
bitter
served
the
way
it
was
brewed
to
be
a
pretty
good
ale
id
like
to
try
this
on
cask
for
having
4
hops
varieties
fuggles
ekg
target
and
challenger
this
has
some
pretty
gloppy
malts
that
and
a
big
diacetyl
hit
make
this
a
bit
of
hard
work
doesnt
strongarm
anyone
im
from
hartlepool
so
i
might
be
biased
but
if
made
correctly
hand
pulled
hard
with
a
sprinkler
on
the
tap
i
think
this
beer
is
extremely
hard
to
beat
and
deserves
greater
recognition
my
hometown
beer
you
love
it
or
hate
it
i
love
it
drinkability
is
very
good
nice
easy
drinking
and
tasty
ale
i
love
these
simple
sessionable
british
ales
good
stuff
pleasing
to
the
taste
buds
and
the
thirst
nothing
gets
in
the
way
of
the
drinkability
id
love
to
try
this
beer
on
cask
a
light
easily
drinkable
session
brew
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
or
recommend
this
one
drinkability
very

there
just

to
check
my

on

opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
am
nort
a
huge
fan
of
the
british
styles
for
the
most
part
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
i
like
a
beer
with
lighter
water
and
this
one
sits
on
my
palate
pretty
heavy
i
would
drink
it
again
but
it
will
not
be
one
that
i
seek
out
d
it
is
alright
nothing

wouldnt
get
one
of

this

begins
to

this
is
a

nothing
great
this

a

a

almost
smells

the
taste
is
bitter
but
smooth
however
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
the
bitterness
is
a
little
overwhelming

to
have

i
wouldnt

more
than

a
touch

a

overall
id
say
this
is
a
nice
enough
brew
good
drinkability
but
the
close
is
a
little
weak
making
a
little
too
much
of
a
switch
for
me
had
this
brew
on
cask
last
evening
while
at
mahars
must
say
that
is
it
an
interesting
brew
the
brew
had
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
broke
down
very
slowly
and
left
some
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
brew
was
of
caramel
and
butterscotch
malt
the
taste
does
along
with
the
aroma
but
you
get
a
strong
apple
cider
flavored
finish
it
took
me
a
while
to
actually
figure
out
what
i
was
experiencing
a
very
different
tasting
brew
the
flavor
even
though
different
seemed
to
be
weak
or
was
missing
something
over
all
it
was
a
nice
brew
and
was
very
happy
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
on
cask
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
compare
in
the
future
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
overall
i
was
happily
impressed
with
this
offering
as
id
never
tried
anything
from
this
brewer
for
3pint
the
price
isnt
bad
and
it
was
definitely
worth
the
money
to
try
it
could
be
a
good
session
beer
if
it
was
available
around
here
in
6
or
12packs
light
bodied
and
smooth
i
couldnt
even
finish
one
very
lovely
english
ale
but
not
very
pale
in
color
or
character
beautiful
complexity
and
excellent
drinkability
if
i
saw
this
next
to
a
mass
produced
american
beer
which
i
dislike
i
would
choose
the
strongarm
at
least
it
has
some
interesting
aspects
at
least
more
so
than
the
mass
produced
junk
this
is
a
strong
4
in
my
eyes
the
smell
was
nice
and
malty
with
hints
of
fruits
i
was
a
little
nervous
thinking
that
this
one
might
have
a
lot
of
hops
in
it
but
its
just
the
opposite
its
got
a
nice
solid
malty
backbone
which
is
something
i
really
favor
the
taste
and
the
smell
are
quite
similar
to
each
other
which
denotes
consistancy
the
taste
was
also
very
refreshing
and
actually
quenched
my
thirst
all
in
all
a
great
beer
go
get
some
hops
make
more
of
a
statement
both
in
terms
of
flavor
and
bitterness
on
the
drying
finish
the
body
is
strictly
medium
for
the
style
and
i
find
myself
wishing
for
more
mouthfilling
creaminess
strongarm
is
quite
the
complex
brew
amazing
since
its
only
4
alcohol
who
says
that
session
beer
cant
be
serious
beer
my
only
complaint
on
this
beer
is
its
flavor
profile
smoothness
is
exception
and
a
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
but
this
beer
almost
tasted
a
little
watered
down
and
is
missing
a
little
in
the
malt
department
im
sure
it
would
have
been
much
better
on
cask
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
brussels
sprouts
tolerable
but
fairly
obnoxious
pours
a
nice
deep
ruby
with
a
creamylike
head
that
sticks
nicely
to
the
glassaroma
of
brown
sugar
dominates
here
but
its
quite
subtle
taste
is
all
english
here
biscuity
and
some
brown
sugar
notes
as
well
as
a
light
metallic
flavors
light
but
full
of
flavor
wow
a
real
nice
brew
great
to
get
my
hands
on
would
just
love
to
get
a
chance
to
try
this

this

poured
a

the
taste
was
slightly
sweet

with
some
tangy

notes
and
a
low

the
body
was

was

definitely

sampler
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
or
even
necessarily
a
particularly
memorable
one
but
its
easily
one
of
the
best
english
bitters
ive
had
in
years
and
for
that
reason
i
must
give
it
some
sincere
props
solid
stuff
that
all
english
ale
fans
should
consider
worth
a
shot
id
definitely
be
buying
more
if
it
were
available
in
this
province
in
a
more
convenient
format
o
certainly
not
bad
but
not
great
low

ale
gets
much
more
flavourful
than
this

has

also
some
stale
in
there
overall
a
very
complex
bitter
with
a
lot
of
character
and
a
wellbalanced
ever
changing
flavour
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
so
i
drank
it
almost
forgetting
to
make
my
normal
notes
if
you
want
to
try
and
rate
a
good
bitter
i
recommend
this
one
served
on
cask
in
philly
pours
light
amber
with
an
almost
grapefruitlike
hue
and
the
thick
creamy
head
of
cask
beer
nose
has
faint
whiffs
of
biscuits
and
toast
taste
is
surprisingly
fruity
with
back
current
of
woody
tannins
body
is
thin
but
supported
by
the
nice
carbonation
from
the
cask
both
that
and
the
cask
temperature
were
a
huge
compliment
to
the
beer
it
would
have
been
a
far
lesser
beer
served
cold
from
a
keg
overall
impression
considering
this
ale
only
sports
3
4
abv
it
packs
a
malty
and
flavorful
punch
surprisingly
complex
and
flavorful
this
is
highly
indicative
of
the
english
brewing
style
finding
ways
to
create
flavorful
beers
without
having
to
jack
up
body
and
abv
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
explode
in
the
mouth
and
finish
with
a
earthy
bitter
twinge
this
is
an
ale
that
you
could
drink
all
night
long
enjoy
every
last
drop
and
not
stagger
out
of
the
pub
drunkenly

very
sessionable

would

just
looked
at
the
bottle
its
not
spoiled
however
it
is
brewed
in
belguim
i
dont
know
why
but
that
has
a
funny
feeling
to
it
o
one
of
the
best
additions
to
the
swedish
supermarket
shelves
so
far
why
dont
we
import
more
beers
like
this
instead
of
watered
down
versions
of
stronger
likes
a
great
british
session
beer
thats
nice
on
its
own
as
well
as
with
most
typical
british
and
swedish
dishes
goood
conclusiona
pretty
tasty
bitter
at
3
4
this
would
make
one
really
nice
quaffable
true
session
ale
the
bitterness
is
still
just
a
bit
high
for
me
in
that
for
me
it
overtakes
the
malt
just
a
bit
too
much
i
like
my
bitters
fairly
balanced
if
leaning
towards
the
bitter
side
still
this
one
isnt
bad
at
all
all
round
an
extremely
agreeable
bitter
and
a
pleasant
companion
for
the
evening
this
would
be
ideal
with
shepherds
pie
english
tikka
masala
or
ye
olde
fish
chips
a
decent
ale
the
flavour
is
subtly
complex
but
not
over
the
top
makes
for
easy
drinking
worth
cracking
one
open
if
you
come
across
it
utterly
and
absolutely
gorgeous
stuff
very
thing
body
d
a
pretty
tasty
beer
for
3
4
just
a
shame
the
value
isnt
there
but
if
i
was
sitting
in
a
pub
by
the
thames
drinking
this
all
afternoon
id
be
happy
enough
decent
sessioner
but
not
at
these
prices
drinkable
if
given
an
open
mind
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
hopefully
ill
find
a
pub
that
has
it
on
tap
im
sure
it
i
would
appreciate
it
more
this
brew
is
rather
drinkable
due
to
the
mellow
taste
and
a
low
alcohol
content
nonetheless
i
do
prefer
stronger
bitters
and
thus
consider
them
as
more
drinkable
ironically
i
dont
find
most
english
bitters
to
be
all
that
bitter
but
this
one
is
i
enjoy
trying
new
beers
and
this
one
was
no
different
but
having
said
that
its
way
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
fairly
standard
one
dimensional
bitter
with
enough
of
a
hop
bite
to
make
it
palatable
slightly
oily
on
the
tongue
reminds
me
of
the
badger
beers
easy
drinking
well
made
but
not
real
interesting
i
loved
the
colour
if
the
brakspear
dark
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
on
giving
it
a
good
sniff
it
was
slighty
bready
and
laced
with
bananas
the
first
mouthful
was
a
delight
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
refreshing
bitterness
but
then
strange
things
started
to
happen
it
started
to
smell
vaguely
of
rubber
tyres
oak
and
even
whisky
the
problem
was
a
lack
of
consistency
within
the
pint
one
minute
there
was
a
strange
smell
and
then
the
next
it
was
gone
i
found
that
towards
the
end
of
the
pint
it
had
become
stale
reminding
me
of
digestive
biscuits
that
go
soft

light

with
some
dry

taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
dry

it
was
relatively
well
done

i
might
have
to
get
more
this
would
be
stellar
on

a
decent
bottled
bitter
could
be
a
little
bolder
and
hoppy
though
plain
and
simple
nice
you
can
have
this
beer
anytime
considering
the
low
abv
a
new
one
at
the
lcbo
low
in
alcohol
at
3
5
but
very
tasty
lots
of
flavours
going
in
in
this
malty
butterscotch
biscuit
very
bitter
like
a
bitter
should
be
the
label
states
that
this
is
a
double
fermented
ale
very
rich
very
fresh
and
very
drinkable
easy
drinking
classic
tasting

id
love
to
have
it
on

not
a

which
is

thing
i
have
had
a
few
good
offerings
i
enjoyed
from
brakspear
but
this
beer
a
3
5
well
malted
bitter
was
nothing
like
what
it
should
be
i
will
try
to
avoid
a
rant
before
it
begins
by
saying
anyone
whos
been
to
england
and
had
true
bitters
that
is
to
say
unpasteurized
unfiltered
and
fresh
off
cask
can
attest
that
these
imports
are
a
ghost
of
the
real
selves
that
said
this
is
all
i
have
to
go
by
at
least
hopefully
only
for
now
d
doesnt
get
any
more
drinkable
than
this
superb
nice
amber
color
firm
and
creamy
head
smell
of
wet
grass
and
fresh
hops
with
hints
of
tar
taste
of
pink
grapefruit
macadamia
with
hints
of
sultanas
and
lime
a
bit
watery
perhaps
nevertheless
probably
one
of
the
better
brews
from
wychwood
low
abv
of
3
4
makes
it
an
excellent
beer
for
session
drinking
overall
a
pretty
standard
bitter
no
real
flaws
just
not
the
most
exciting
beer
in
the
world
worth
a
try
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
not
sweet
or
sour
just
a
pleasant
session
beer
ideal
for
an
afternoon
in
a
beergarden
on
one
of
those
rare
sunny
days
we
have
during
an
english
summer
d
goes
down
really
easy
and
with
an
abv
of
34
you
could
drink
a
considerable
amount
of
it
without
getting
too
cocky
the
colour
is
of
copper
yellow
wild
honey
and
it
pours
with
weird
big
bubbles
looking
like
soap
the
smell
is
bitter
with
apples
pears
and
a
pinch
of
caramel
the
initial
taste
is
almost
of
apple
juice
with
the
bitterness
kicking
in
after
a
few
seconds
but
im
sorry
to
say
i
found
it
very
watery
and
on
the
flat
side
but
then
why
not
its
a
lowalcohol
english
bitter
the
aftertaste
is
not
so
bad
although
the
as
a
whole
i
think
the
product
begs
for
another
percent

this
bitter
stands
out
from
the
bog
standard
bitters
you
find
in
england
because
well
its
actually
bitter
edit
i
first
encountered
this
as
part
of
the
old
all
saints
brands
import
portfolio
and
was
positively
ecstatic
to
see
it
return
via
shelton

naturally
the
brewery
closed
soon
after
may
or
may
not
be
brewed
by
the
good
folks
at

an
original
summer
beer
not
very
spectacular
maybe
i
just
dont
have
enough
experience
with
english
bitters
but
this
beer
didnt
sit
so
well
with
me
had
on
draft
at
the
times
clear
amberreddish
color
perhaps
a
little
lighter
than
that
grainy
flavor
that
youll
occasionally
get
out
of
scottish
beers
on
tap
average
carbonation
it
just
didnt
sit
well
with
me
for
a
summer
beer
better
directions
to
go
in
for
something
like
that
out
there
meh
a
pretty
poor
effort
bland
and
watery
with
little
depth
or
character
to
keep
you
interested
the
newcastle
brand
is
going
to
be
subject
to
the
law
of
diminishing
returns
if
it
keeps
making
brews
like
this
give
it
a
miss
malty
feel
to
the
actual
taste
but
this
a
watery
brew
and
it
doesnt
carry
the
4
4
abv
very
well
at
all
nicely
carbonated
but
lacks
depth
of
flavour
and
comes
across
as
a
weak
almost
bland
blend
to
be
fair
it
does
have
a
crisp
bitter
bite
towards
the
end
but
overall
i
wasnt
really
impressed
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tall
pint
glass
pours
a
translucent
yellow
orange
with
a
small
white
head
with
some
lacing
smells
fruity
and
grainy
nice
and
inviting
tastes
of
slight
fruit
sweet
with
a
nice
grain
profile
beer
is
quite
watery
and
is
slightly
under
carbonated
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
overall
a
bit
of
a
strange
flavor
combination
the
fruity
estery
taste
seems
out
of
place
the
carbonation
is
too
high
lacks
malt
profile
says
hops
and
glory
on
the
bottle
it
has
an
old
hops
and
that
canned
mushroom
english
malt
flavour
with
the
said
i
like
this
brew
much
better
than
regular
old
new
castle
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
grassy
floral
nose
a
bit
of
an
aged
hops
smell
the
hops
and
malt
in
this
brew
are
balanced
very
nicely
i
would
get
this
one
over
regular
new
castle
o
i
did
not
enjoy
this
very
much
something
just
seemed
off
if
i
had
this
on
tap
i
would
question
how
clean
the
lines
were
the
taste
seemed
off
and
the
mouthfeel
was
poor
in
my
opinion
i
enjoy
newcastle
brown
ale
so
i
thought
this
would
be
okay
it
was
not
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
o
i
would
choose
this
over
most
macros
but
it
would
certainly
not
be
something
that
i
would
drink
normally
i
am
glad
that
i
got
this
beer
on
sale
to
say
the
least
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
nice
beer
to
session
with
for
a
long
time
a
basic
bitter
golden
ale
a
decent
offering
and
one
that
i
would
have
no
problems
drinking
again
but
not
one
that
is
particularly
worth
going
looking
for
if
its
available
give
it
a
go
otherwise
drink
what
you
find
conclusion
a
fairly
good
beer
for
a
macro
that
is
for
sure
as
for
being
a
real
bitter
it
falls
short
but
it
would
be
an
alright
choice
if
the
alternatives
were
all
macro
lagers
overall
this
beer
is
ok
i
wouldnt
buy
it
a
second
time
though
in
my
opinion
it
is
mislabeled
this
isnt
a
traditional
summer
beer
again
the
hops
do
show
with
balancing
malt
but
the
butter
is
too
much
here
while
it
does
add
to
the
complexity
and
balance
here
it
goes
a
bit
overboard
i
can
drink
a
few
but
will
have
a
butter
aftertaste
with
just
a
hint
of
the
hops
that
were
present
in
the
aroma
and
initial
flavour
overall
though
a
nice
enough
summer
bitter
odifferent
summer
beer
from
many
others
i
have
had
a
bit
more
bitter
which
was
nice
good
session
beer
definitely
one
of
the
better
summer
ales
ive
tried
this
beer
is
a
light
pale
yellowish
color
it
pours
smoothly
into
my
snifter
and
has
an
average
amount
of
head
lace
and
foam
it
has
a
typical
summer
ale
aroma
of
lemon
and
lager
it
is
a
beautiful
color
and
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
great
for
barbeques
and
backyard
swim
parties
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
a
summer
beer
most
labeled
as
such
are
sweet
and
golden
but
mostly
bland
but
i
like
it
the
summer
ale
is
a
yellow
straw
color
on
the
first
taste
there
are
alot
of
hops
and
bitterness
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
to
be
honest
the
only
reason
i
am
trying
this
is
because
im
a
huge
fan
of
newcastle
brown
ale
its
my
favorite
beer
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
summer
ales
i
like
my
beer
dark
but
anyways
this
summer
ale
isnt
too
bad
goes
down
smooth
if
that
is
what
you
like
its
worth
giving
a
try
cheers
a
good
attempt
by
a
larger
established
brewer
however
not
a
refreshing
enough
beer
for
summer
overall
a
disappointing
beer
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
doesnt
have
much
taste
i
could
see
where
this
might
appeal
to
quenching
thirst
on
a
blazing
summer
day
but
taste
this
just
doesnt
have
it
i
recommend
passing
on
this
the
fact
that
this
got
any
good
reviews
makes
me
wonder
if
i
had
a
bad
batch
oda
nice
partner
to
their
trademark
brown
ale
this
single
bottle
was
a
pleasant
surprise
while
a
solid
beer
not
really
much
that
would
draw
me
back
to
this
again
in
the
future
it
pours
a
mediumlight
copper
with
a
slight
foamy
offwhite
head
leaving
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
smell
is
very
hoppy
slightly
nuttybready
taste
is
also
hoppy
bitter
and
slightly
acidic
the
beer
starts
strong
but
it
ends
a
little
flat
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
of
these
would
be
pushing
it
in
my
opinion
i
would
buy
it
again
on
a
hot
day
too
expensive
for
the
return
but
a
decent
brew
overall
hey
its
better
then
a
bud
or
miller
it
is
what
it
is
a
average
beer
that
should
be
easy
to
find
if
your
stuck
somewhere
looking
for
a
beer
that
actually
has
some
flavor
to
it
its
nothing
special
at
all
lacks
in
many
areas
like
complexity
hop
kick
overal
amount
of
flavor
but
its
not
a
drain
pour
atleast
it
pours
with
a
nicelooking
color
that
is
between
amber
and
golden
i
was
getting
twofinger
head
on
my
pour
decent
lacing
at
first
head
disappears
in
about
10
minutes
there
was
some
foam
laying
on
top
after
sitting
for
2025
with
a
last
mouthful
of
beer
aroma
is
ok
reminds
me
of
boddingtons
it
has
a
nice
citruslike
finish
but
not
in
the
taste
feels
slightly
tangy
a
little
hoppy
but
not
strong
light
maltiness
it
is
kind
of
like
a
nut
brown
ale
light
seems
pleasant
enough
to
drink
on
a
scorching
summer
day
but
not
an
outstanding
beer
for
summer
beer
i
prefer
to
drink
a
heffe
or
kolsch
pours
to
a
nice
creamy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
color
is
dark
gold
and
clear
aroma
presents
with
sweet
malt
clover
honey
and
butterscotch
flavor
is
a
mild
and
balanced
blend
of
earthy
hops
and
sweet
malt
finishes
clean
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
light
watery
and
low
carbonation
which
is
good
for
style
overall
a
nice
session
beer
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
and
still
get
some
hops
and
malt
o
the
style
is
identified
as
an
english
bitter
but
they
want
to
sell
this
as
a
summer
ale
in
the
us
that
means
something
a
bit
different
some
spice
or
citrus
this
is
ok
as
an
ordinary
bitter
it
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
clean
and
refreshing
but
nothing
special
overall
i
would
recommend
trying
this
brew
once
just
for
the
sake
of
trying
it
its
not
going
ot
knock
your
socks
off
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
is
unique
and
worth
a
try
at
least
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
i
would
drink
it
again
do
lifes
too
short
to
drink
subpar
beer
its
not
particularly
drinkable
and
its
not
particularly
enjoyable
my
guess
is
theyre
moving
cases
of
this
because
they
called
it
summer
ale
this
is
a
decent
quaff
bmwatsjun
23
o
not
a
bad
beer
just
too
sweet
and
not
enough
hop
or
bitter
for
my
tastes
o
this
actually
got
a
little
bit
better
as
i
continued
to
drink
it
but
overall
i
would
not
buy
this
again
flavors
are
just
off
from
the
12
fl

bottle

newcastle
has
brewed
up
a
golden
yellow
beer
that
has
a
short
lasting
head
and
an
odd
aroma
i
get
malts
yeast
and
floral
hops
on
the
nose
but
there
is
something
else
offsetting
the
whole
thing
something
akin
to
ginger
the
body
is
summer
seasonal
light
and
creamy
the
taste
has
a
kind
of
cardboard
like
maltiness
with
a
more
notable
bitter
hop
finish
that
lingers
for
a
moment
there
are
summer
seasonals
from
other
brewers
that
i
find
to
be
more
appealing
than
this
one
i
think
i
will
stick
with
their
traditional
nut
brown
ale
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
average
example
of
an
english
bitter
i
dont
have
any
experience
with
this
style
so
that
might
not
be
that
accurate
but
i
see
this
beer
as
average
all
the
way
around
regardless
of
style
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
somewhat
smooth
and
a
little
crisp
but
the
flavors
are
bland
and
dont
hold
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
i
wouldnt
want
another
one
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
and
while
not
the
best
they
didnt
have
many
flaws
like
the
other
aspects
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
the
taste
they
were
just
too
bland
with
not
enough
hops
showing
up
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
and
i
cant
say
i
would
really
recommend
this
beer
as
far
as
summer
ales
go
its
not
hard
to
find
a
much
better
one
i
have
had
their
newcastle
ale
before
but
i
havent
reviewed
it
its
a
solid
english
beer
and
is
a
little
similar
to
this
beer
but
the
extra
hops
that
they
advertise
really
dont
show
up
i
wasnt
impressed
with
beer
but
i
still
think
this
brewery
is
pretty
solid
ill
have
to
try
more
of
their
beers
but
this
one
just
wasnt
for
me
id
say
this
brew
is
pretty
much
a
lighter
version
of
regular
newcastle
not
bad
looking
light
brown
decent
head
and
lace
with
some
staying
power
malty
little
hops
not
really
an
exciting
beer
but
a
pleasant
enough
bitter
if
you
like
newcastle
youll
like
this
3
5
across
the
board
o
not
a
bad
beer
way
better
than
that
spring
thing
i
just
had
of
theirs
with
the
different
flavors
in
the
taste
than
the
smell
this
is
a
pleasant
summer
brew
especially
for
the
fact
that
i
wasnt
expecting
this
pours
medium
amber
with
light
foaming
see
through
light
malty
smell
but
a
little
offputting
light
citrus
small
summery
taste
some
lemon
citrus
backed
with
a
nuttiness
fruits
around
the
edges
residual
bitter
i
would
suggest
this
as
an
alternative
for
the
summer
outing
to
your
bmc
this
beer
is
good
not
great
12oz
bottle
purchased
at

basket
in
somersworth
pours
a
crystalclear
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
film
of
offwhite
head
caramel
and
bread
dominate
the
aroma
with
butterscotch
and
floral
hop
notes
bready
with
bits
of
toast
and
caramel
and
floral
hops
in
the
background
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
superdrinkable
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
a
pleasant
surprise
and
something
different
from
the
normal
blondes
and
wheats
of
this
time
of
year
overall
not
your
average
summer
ale
the
herbal
hops
and
toasted
flavors
make
this
one
interesting
but
take
away
from
the
drinkablityrefreshing
factor
you
want
in
your
summer
ale
overall
a
serviceable
light
ale
cheers
o
a
beer
that
is
average
and
tolerable
but
not
really
anything
overly
pleasant
a
tad
too
bitter
for
me
tastelight
toasted
malt
subtle
mineral
note
with
some
soft
hops
coming
along
for
the
ride
a
bit
toasty
and
lagerish
upon
warming
but
properly
chilled
is
quite
easygoing
and
refreshing
d
this
one
isnt
so
bad
although
its
getting
bashed
all
over
the
place
if
i
was
blindfolded
i
wouldnt
guess
it
as
a
bitter
actually
i
would
be
stumped
the
unchecked
diacetyl
and
prevalent
grain
husk
are
somewhat
alarming
but
in
the
end
its
a
well
balanced
not
so
bad
kinda
summery
beer
nah
watered
down
cheap
keg
bitter
is
preferable
to
this
shite
drinkability
is
average
an
easy
drinker
that
you
can
pound
but
not
a
lot
of
good
tastes
going
on
so
not
a
real
reason
to
pound
it
worth
a
try
if
served
it
at
a
party
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
it
o
terrible
a
nice
little
english
bitter
a
crowd
pleaser
id
think
did
me
well
3
5
this
ale
is
more
like
for
dead
parrots
and
budweiser
fans
save
your
schillings
rjt
o
this
was
okay
it
seemed
a
little
unbalanced
a
little
messy
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
theres
nothing
really
special
about
the
taste
this
would
make
a
good
lawnmower
beer
or
something
to
pair
with
a
summer
bbq
an
average
bitter
at
best
glad
i
was
able
to
pick
this
up
as
single
it
would
take
me
months
to
work
through
a
sixer
of
this
this
might
be
better
served
at
lager
temps
or
even
icecold
o
seems
like
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
nothing
really
stands
out
to
make
it
memorable
definitely
something
to
quench
the
thirst
o
almost
feels
like
ive
outgrown
newcastle
used
to
be
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
but
every
variation
ive
had
is
a
far
cry
from
the
quality
i
used
to
enjoy
definitely
one
of
the
better
summer
ales
ive
tried
this
beer
is
a
light
pale
yellowish
color
it
pours
smoothly
into
my
snifter
and
has
an
average
amount
of
head
lace
and
foam
it
has
a
typical
summer
ale
aroma
of
lemon
and
lager
it
is
a
beautiful
color
and
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
great
for
barbeques
and
backyard
swim
parties
o
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
around
for
a
social
gathering
as
long
as
the
gathering
doesnt
really
care
what
their
beer
tastes
like
overall
this
is
average
at
best
but
bordering
on
bad
i
finished
it
but
i
thought
about
letting
the
drain
do
it
for
me
overall
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
and
at
4
4
abv
and
the
lighter
flavors
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
throwing
back
a
few
after
mowing
the
lawn
thirst
quenching
for
sure
with
a
pretty
nice
and
fairly
dry
finish
a
clear
apple
juice
color
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fade
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
randomly
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
grains
and
caramel
malt
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
malt
and
a
slight
metallic
flavor
there
is
also
a
sour
aspect
to
this
beer
after
each
sip
the
bottle
label
says
hops
and
glory
but
i
really
dont
get
any
evidence
of
noticeable
hop
aromas
or
flavors
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
really
doesnt
say
summer
in
my
opinion
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
newcastle
summer
ale
has
a
pretty
nice
smell
i
feel
like
i
am
detecting
some
chocolate
barley
the
color
is
a
nice
rich
golden
brown
its
quite
good
looking
the
taste
is
rich
and
powerful
at
first
but
it
quickly
wanes
to
a
watered
down
nothing
i
wish
it
had
a
stronger
finish
i
feel
like
in
attempt
to
make
a
really
drinkable
summer
ale
they
fell
a
little
short
on
what
makes
newcastle
a
good
beer
and
thats
the
great
fullness
of
its
flavor
this
over
all
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
there
are
better
summer
ales
out
there
o
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
nothing
memorable
either
very
drinkable
not
heavy
and
nice
balance
typical
summerdriven
incarnation
here
to
drum
up
sales
summer
light
and
golden
right
nothing
wrong
with
that
just
typical
clear
and
golden
impressive
head
on
top
buttery
nose
with
some
spicy
hop
presence
smoothness
over
crispness
in
a
fluffy
light
body
buttery
yeast
flavor
is
the
main
attraction
here
with
the
malt
helping
to
round
it
out
hops
have
a
quick
kiss
of
bitterness
and
spicy
flavor
light
bready
maltiness
peeks
through
right
before
the
dry
finish
the
buttery
tone
eventually
chips
away
at
the
drinkability
not
half
bad
but
the
flavor
doesnt
scream
summer
to
us
so
perhaps
its
not
so
typical
after
all
sure
the
alcohol
was
light
in
this
but
i
dont
think
thats
why
people
would
grab
one
of
these
in
the
summer
this
was
nothing
like
the
flagship
from
newcastle
and
the
bottle
wasnt
even
clear
the
familiar
shape
is
there
but
thats
where
the
similarities
end
lots
of
hefes
and
summer
ales
would
fit
the
bill
better
than
this
and
unless
youre
a
newcastle
fan
this
beer
is
probably
worth
passing
over
overall
this
is
not
a
half
bad
little
beer
i
could
definitely
quaff
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
beer
pours
a
sort
of
clear
honey
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
left
a
touch
of
lace
in
the
glass
and
a
thin
white
film
on
top
cracker
like
grain
aromas
with
a
thin
bit
of
lemon
on
the
end
taste
follows
suit
with
maybe
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
up
front
and
a
modest
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
i
appreciate
the
different
flavor
profile
that
the
english
hops
have
to
offer
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
cascades
chinooks
and
the
like
but
it
is
nice
to
have
something
that
is
not
over
the
top
with
citrus
and
pine
once
in
a
while
overall
this
beer
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
doesnt
offer
a
whole
lot
of
excitement
basically
if
i
were
at
a
barbecue
and
the
choices
were
bmc
or
this
i
would
jump
all
over
it
on
my
dollar
maybe
not
d
had
a
few
of
these
at
a
cookout
and
rather
enjoyed
them
nothing
worth
writing
home
about
but
if
youre
in
a
similar
situation
you
could
certainly
do
worse
the
overall
score
may
not
impress
a
whole
lot
but
it
sure
beats
newkie
brown
from
the
bottle
for
that
matter
its
better
than
many
of
the
large
scale
commmercial
beers
out
on
the
market
with
so
many
wonderful
craft
options
for
a
similar
price
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
however
it
would
do
in
a
pinch
flavor
is
thin
and
light
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
emerging
only
after
some
exposure
finish
is
dry
and
earthy
once
again
and
doesnt
offer
any
real
bitterness
overall
just
a
big
question
mark
for
me
o
compared
to
other
examples
of
the
style
i
generally
feel
its
sub
par
however
this
beer
is
not
without
its
merits
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
in
the
cooler
for
those
summer
parties
to
surprise
the
bmc
crowd
without
being
too
intimidating
while
maintaining
just
enough
something
in
the
taste
department
for
your
self
this
seemed
to
remind
me
of
heineken
but
without
the
skunk
the
very
light
sweetness
of
the
malt
balanced
well
with
the
bitter
there
is
so
much
out
there
that
is
better
but
there
isnt
anything
here
to
hate
standard
average
brew
d
quite
high
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
had
this
one
on
tap
last
summer
and
never
thought
to
write
down
any
thoughts
about
it
maybe
it
wasnt
too
memorable
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
billowing
white
head
leaves
behind
thin
wispy
lace
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
a
nice
earthy
citric
hop
character
with
light
pale
airy
malts
a
bit
of
cracker
and
white
bread
grain
action
going
on
nice
to
see
a
one
trick
pony
do
something
different
for
a
changes
flavor
is
light
on
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
fruity
apple
notes
and
pale
malt
sweetness
a
very
nice
refreshing
mass
produced
beer
that
strays
from
mass
produced
beer
under
4
4
abv
send
me
this
in
cans
and
i
will
tailgate
before
the
concert
or
the
big
game
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
definitely
a
summer
drinking
beer
not
a
lager
but
a
light
floralcitrus
lightly
hopped
golden
bitter
each
sip
is
more
enjoyable
than
the
next
excellent
easy
going
mass
produced
english
summer
ale
d
a
bit
heavier
than
a
pale
ale
but
lighter
than
most
summers
not
overly
fruity
just
a
little
bite
on
the
back
of
the
palate
pours
a
clear
slightly
coppery
golden
amber
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
yeasty
fruity
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
quite
appealing
yeasty
wheaty
malty
flavor
has
a
slight
woody
undertone
the
edgy
and
sassy
texture
makes
for
a
nice
finish
to
a
good
beer
for
kicking
off
summer
i
was
so
excited
to
see
this
beer
in
the
store
because
all
newcastle
makes
is
their
brown
ale
poured
into
glass
a
hazy
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
this
beer
tastes
like
funky
carbonated
dishwater
something
isnt
right
with
this
beer
on
the
label
it
says
hops
and
glory
i
barely
taste
any
hops
was
really
hoping
to
like
this
beer
but
it
just
wasnt
good
d
this
wasnt
really
that
special
its
a
unique
style
that
i
havent
tried
much
but
it
seemed
just
mediocre
overall
very
interesting
taste
even
though
i
dont
love
the
taste
itself
its
still
an
interesting
beer
to
sample
not
much
left
to
say
about
this
one
the
bitterness
is
a
little
too
much
and
a
little
off
for
the
amount
of
malt
in
this
one
also
some
of
the
bolder
notes
dont
exactly
work
well
with
the
light
malt
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
i
guess
ill
stick
to
the
one
and
only
stay
thirsty
my
friends
poured
a
sparkling
light
orange
with
an
average
size
white
frothy
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
nice
and
crisp
of
a
nutty
caramel
malt
floral
hops
and
an
earthy
yeast
it
tasted
a
slightly
sweet
a
little
acidic
and
mildly
bitter
from
start
to
finish
with
a
slight
malty
feel
at
the
end
the
flavor
had
a
short
duration
although
it
did
leave
a
nice
light
hoppy
flavor
lingering
for
quite
a
while
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
yet
dry
in
texture
with
a
nice
fizzy
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
ale
with
a
nice
light
hoppy
aftertaste
i
think
this
is
the
british
equivalent
of
lawnmower
beer
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
solid
summer
ale
not
bold
in
any
way
but
certainly
something
that
could
be
enjoyed
in
the
cool
spring
or
warm
summer
theres
not
much
to
really
like
about
this
beer
low
complexity
and
below
average
flavor
i
wont
have
this
again
drinkability
gross
my
brother
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
the
other
day
before
the
full
onslaught
of
snowtorious
b
i
g
set
upon
us
so
i
figured
id
steal
a
bottle
for
myself
a
little
concerned
about
having
a
summer
ale
in
the
depths
of
winter
but
i
cant
decipher
the
freshness
date
on
the
label
to
ease
my
mind
or
dissuade
me
from
drinking
it
here
goes
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
healthy
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
coriander
menthol
wheat
and
light
grapefruit
peel
the
taste
brings
more
of
the
same
though
the
menthol
is
increased
and
there
is
a
strong
sense
of
the
white
fleshy
part
of
an
oranges
peel
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
in
the
extreme
to
the
point
of
puckering
my
lips
more
like
buckling
them
like
a
boxers
fatigued
legs
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
watery
feel
overall
i
hope
this
was
just
an
old
batch
or
something
cause
it
doesnt
taste
anywhere
near
good
judging
by
the
overall
score
though
it
may
just
be
as
crappy
a
beer
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
very
decent
summer
ale
b
drinkable
only
in
the
blandest
sense
of
the
word
i
see
no
reason
to
ever
have
this
again
d
well
summer
ales
have
come
and
gone
and
even
if
this
beer
hasnt
improved
with
age
it
really
didnt
get
any
worse
i
find
that
i
may
be
able
to
succession
this
brew
if
i
was
in
a
need
for
a
beer
fix
a
very
passable
summer
ale
i
could
easily
put
away
a
few
on
a
warm
day
but
its
far
from
a
great
beer
rich
and
round
bodywise
perhaps
from
a
low
carbonation
relatively
unflavorful
on
the
initial
sip
the
swallow
features
a
touch
of
hop
and
notable
sourness
the
aftertaste
is
blandly
bitter
taste
is
light
pepperyleafy
hops
with
hints
of
bitter
lemon
pulp
slightly
dominating
throughout
with
light
bitterness
just
dominating
over
light
honeybready
sweetness
with
hint
of
buttery
caramel
the
hop
elements
and
bitterness
linger
gently
in
the
clean
lean
finish
and
aftertaste
it
is
pretty
good
a
decent
drinking
beer
but
a
bit
thin
in
character
and
not
at
all
complex
it
is
on
the
bitter
side
and
slightly
lacking
character
or
malt
presence
to
support
this
since
the
hops
mostly
come
through
in
a
bitter
bite
that
has
only
short
hop
flavour
as
noted
above
a
fairly
clean
finish
somewhat
astringent
with
a
medium
body
and
light
effervescence
vey
good
stuff
verdict
newcastle
summer
ale
is
a
solid
little
brew
thoroughly
british
and
easily
drinkable
without
sacrificing
all
character
this
is
one
of
those
cheerful
session
beers
from
that
side
of
the
pond
we
hear
so
much
about
i
was
a
little
skeptical
going
in
but
newcastles
first
seasonal
spinoff
is
a
welcome
addition
for
me
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
minimal
lacing
and
strong
carbination
sweet
caramel
and
malt
dominate
the
aroma
tastes
emtremely
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
butter
and
caramel
taste
flavoring
does
not
appear
balanced
and
is
a
bit
off
while
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
do
not
bode
well
seems
way
off
for
a
form
of
a
english
bitter
and
this
a
poor
choice
for
a
summer
beer
with
so
many
others
out
there
d
this
a
pretty
basic
bitter
it
does
its
job
in
that
its
light
and
refreshing
while
still
having
some
character
d
easy
enough
to
drink
i
suppose
but
slight
hints
of
off
flavors
arent
encouraging
the
vanilla
seems
pretty
outofplace
and
neither
the
hops
nor
the
bitterness
is
large
enough
here
overall
not
a
bad
beer
perfect
for
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
any
other
outdoor
activity
in
the
heat
of
summer
pours
a
very
nice
light
golden
color
with
some
nice
initial
head
and
some
wonderful
lacing
very
nice
aroma
with
a
nice
sweet
malty
undertone
thats
enhanced
by
a
great
hop
aroma
a
bit
jerky
and
eggish
nice
taste
with
a
good
malthop
ratio
sweet
on
top
with
a
quickly
turning
hop
flavor
that
lasts
after
swallowing
slightly
grassy
and
a
lot
of
jerky
in
the
hops
goes
down
very
smooth
with
a
nice
lasting
hop
flavor
db
this
one
started
out
with
some
characteristics
of
an
english
bitter
but
went
downhill
fairly
quickly
the
more
artificial
hop
and
adjunct
flavors
took
over
and
balance
was
lost
it
ended
up
tasting
like
some
kind
of
teasoda
elixir
not
my
kind
of
thing
it
is
fairly
refreshing
when
it
is
cold
but
i
wouldnt
wanna
imbibe
too
many
of
these
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
acceptable
although
appearance
was
tough
to
judge
in
a
plastic
cup
drinkability
score
is
held
down
by
it
tasting
like
crap
on
tap
at
a
concert
at
wolf
trap
tap
choices
were
only
this
or
fellow
heineken
products
heineken
and
amstel
light
i
hadnt
tried
this
and
it
was
hot
and
i
was
thirsty
and
had
just
paid
twice
as
much
as
i
should
have
for
food
so
i
was
ready
for
something
to
drink
thats
about
what
i
got
thirst
quencher
pale
gold
in
the
plastic
glass
12
inch
foam
on
top
slightly
spritzy
bubbles
visible
no
real
smell
to
speak
of
though
initial
taste
was
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
grass
and
then
some
residual
sweetness
plus
well
thats
about
it
as
it
warmed
the
flavor
waned
and
was
replaced
by
an
annoying
diacetyl
buttery
flavor
albeit
faint
that
kinda
ruined
the
whole
thing
i
wish
i
had
ordered
the
amstel
at
least
that
has
some
balance
to
it
as
much
as
i
enjoy
newcastle
brown
and
even
have
some
in
my
fridge
today
i
think
they
missed
it
with
this
i
would
prefer
a
summer
ale
to
go
done
a
little
smoother
and
a
little
cleaner
drink
this
one
cold
cold
cold
this
was
an
ok
beer
the
color
and
appearance
were
better
then
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
it
better
right
from
the
fridge
in
a
frosted
mug
as
the
beer
got
warmer
the
taste
depreciated
i
have
always
like
newcastle
brown
ale
and
will
stick
to
that
and
not
its
summer
ale
this
stuff
is
awful
i
guess
if
i
only
had
a
choice
of
bud
light
busch
and
this
newcastle
summer
ale
i
might
choose
the
busch
beer
at
least
half
the
time
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
half
finger
head
the
aroma
is
faint
i
get
some
caramel
malt
and
not
much
else
maybe
a
hint
of
a
hop
presence
the
taste
is
of
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
slight
citrus
hop
bite
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
low
carbonation
overall
its
not
a
hard
drink
because
there
is
nothing
harsh
about
it
however
the
taste
could
stand
to
be
improved
some
d
this
was
bordering
on
awful
ill
simply
classify
it
as
really
bad
and
suggest
staying
away
from
this
beer
drinkability
it
was
fine
to
have
this
beer
with
pizza
but
on
its
own
its
very
bland
and
uninteresting
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
minimal
white
head
which
disperses
very
fast
no
lacing
lightbodied
with
some
tingly
carbonation
sweet
grassy
malts
with
a
bit
of
hops
astringent
finish
not
impressed
by
this
one
theres
something
about
the
flavor
where
it
rather
tastes
like
regular
newcastle
with
a
bit
of
hops
or
grass
newcastle
brown
ale
is
a
decent
beer
so
i
was
interested
to
give
newcastle
summer
ale
a
try
newcastle
summer
ale
despite
its
name
is
not
a
decent
beer
it
is
on
par
with
an
average
american
adjunct
lager
and
i
dont
suggest
giving
it
a
try
pours
a
filtered
light
orange
color
with
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
little
sweatyskunky
despite
this
being
in
a
brown
bottle
could
just
be
some
earthy
hops
but
its
not
particularly
pleasant
a
bit
of
musty
grain
too
flavor
is
light
grains
and
dust
with
a
hard
finish
similar
to
mineral
water
in
fact
this
might
actually
even
be
maltflavored
mineral
water
kind
of
slimy
on
the
finish
ultrathin
not
a
good
beer
what
i
did
get
from
the
tasting
was
a
pleasant
surprise
whereas
there
is
litte
hop
presence
in
nba
there
is
plenty
here
as
promised
by
the
information
on
the
packaging
a
spicy
fuggles
element
really
comes
through
mouthfeel
is
substantial
and
the
higher
hopping
level
doesnt
affect
the
strong
malt
elements
here
for
nba
they
do
add
corn
grits
as
the
adjunct
and
i
suspect
some
here
also
it
is
alot
less
noticable
in
nsa
the
ale
finshes
with
a
crisp
hop
finish
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
ends
up
being
a
good
quality
bitter
pours
a
dull
pale
oranage
color
with
minimal
head
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
of
light
carmel
malts
faint
floral
and
earth
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
taste
is
reminicient
of
a
mild
newcastle
brown
the
sweet
carmel
matls
are
there
in
lesser
quantity
and
also
a
taste
of
tootsie
roll
like
chocolate
faint
floral
hoping
also
present
certain
sips
tasted
good
others
muddled
a
very
mixed
reaction
medium
bodied
under
carbonated
slight
aftertaste
a
lighter
version
of
the
brown
decent
beer
that
quickly
wears
out
its
welcome
a
better
option
than
bmc
however
drinkability
the
real
reason
i
picked
this
up
was
that
i
drank
so
much
newcastle
brown
in
college
that
i
figured
i
owed
summer
ale
a
shot
if
only
for
old
times
sake
i
mean
the
label
says
hops
and
glory
sadly
neither
were
present
in
this
beer
although
not
a
real
fan
of
brown
ales
i
liked
newcastles
so
figured
their
summer
ale
should
be
decent
wrong
this
poured
from
the
tap
to
a
very
pale
yellow
with
thin
white
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
was
faint
but
tried
to
be
a
floral
and
apple
mix
and
the
mouthfeel
was
flat
taste
was
bland
and
the
finish
had
somewhat
of
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
newcastle
should
stick
to
the
brown
it
goes
down
easy
but
is
just
not
that
exciting
id
have
it
again
but
maybe
next
year
drinkability
though
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
with
it
it
was
nice
to
try
and
maybe
have
been
one
of
those
odd
circumstances
that
made
me
believe
it
was
a
very
mediocre
beer
id
be
willing
to
give
it
another
try
perhaps
at
a
different
establishment
or
from
a
liquor
store
i
was
expecting
more
from
newcastle
this
seems
very
new
to
them
too
hey
keep
trying
sampled
this
on
draft
appearance
was
light
and
moderately
carbonated
the
smell
reminded
me
of
a
bells
oberon
with
a
slight
citrus
nose
taste
was
mostly
citrusy
with
a
tiny
hop
presence
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
with
very
little
finish
a
decent
drinkable
summer
ale
but
nothing
really
exciting
about
this
one
overall
a
very
weak
effort
its
a
limited
time
brew
worth
a
shot
pizza
club
a
slice
above
the
rest
in
la
habra
carries
this
beer
on
draft
the
only
real
criticism
is
that
for
a
summer
beer
i
expected
a
little
more
carbonation
to
leave
my
mouth
cleaner
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
but
its
not
honey
overall
its
a
great
addition
for
newcastle
overall
normally
i
am
not
that
big
a
fan
of
english
mid
bitters
due
to
the
massive
price
in
australia
mainly
due
to
our
stupid
excise
laws
and
taxes
on
well
everything
this
is
a
goodtasting
beer
for
a
3
6
it
is
fairly
light
but
the
flavours
are
there
and
are
quite
identifiable
a
good
price
at
au77
for
a
case
of
24
x
440ml
be
warned
dont
drink
it
too
cold
it
kills
the
taste
badly
food
match
dont
go
overboard
with
flavours
on
this
brew
otherwise
whats
the
point
im
picturing
potato
and
leek
soup
with
crusty
bread
or
a
minestrone
or
cream
of
mushroom
or
winter
vegetable
or
you
get
the
idea
soup
nitrocan
poured
into
an
english
pub
glass
a
rather
light
golden
straw
color
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
red
once
the
entire
glass
of
billowing
beige
nitro
bubbles
gradually
broke
actually
looks
pretty
cool
as
the
bubbles
recede
and
the
beer
coalesces
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
is
rather
weak
and
mellow
but
i
do
get
a
tealike
floral
and
fruity
scent
along
with
scant
doughy
malts
taste
is
similarly
subdued
with
some
juicy
fruit
bubblegum
very
light
citrus
iced
tea
and
dry
bitter
tea
leaf
hops
putting
in
appearances
ultrathin
body
and
silky
smooth
one
of
the
creamiest
beers
i
have
yet
to
sample
and
admittedly
i
enjoyed
this
aspect
the
carbonation
is
high
but
feels
soft
with
little
in
the
way
of
astringent
burning
good
ol
nitro
bubbles
finish
does
not
really
linger
although
there
is
a
persistent
metallic
tang
i
can
appreciate
this
modern
english
bitter
for
what
it
is
a
low
abv
brew
drinkable
in
massive
quantities
look
elsewhere
for
robust
flavors
o
dont
expect
much
from
something
like
this
though
once
again
its
funny
how
something
like
boddingtons
manages
to
stand
out
in
the
crowd
final
grade
3
23
a
c
tetleys
smoothflow
isnt
the
worst
nitro
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
definitely
not
the
best
either
this
is
a
mediocre
english
bitterpale
ale
with
no
real
strong
points
to
counter
the
typical
weak
points
of
this
style
of
beer
weak
aroma
mild
flavour
and
flat
mouthfeel
at
2
50
a
can
and
only
available
in
four
packs
this
isnt
something
i
anticipate
ill
be
returning
to
at
any
point
in
the
near
future
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
boddingtons
in
that
both
are
proofpositive
that
imported
ales
can
be
every
bit
as
dull
and
lifeless
as
north
american
pale
lagers
rjt
between
the
low
abv
smooth
taste
and
low
carbonation
this
beer
is
too
easy
to
drink
o
decent
beer
for
the
style
and
quite
sessionable
something
of
an
oddity
here
from
the
nitro
can
pours
at
first
like
a
disgusting
milkshake
but
makes
a
comeback
into
a
bronze
liquid
littered
with
tiny
yeast
bits
and
a
dense
as
anything
nitro
head
just
off
white
and
unwavering
the
nose
is
bitter
and
dry
english
malts
with
some
finishing
hops
and
some
metallic
notes
the
flavor
is
about
the
same
real
bitter
on
the
back
end
and
a
really
minerally
finish
not
particularly
pleasant
but
not
downright
brutal
either
the
longer
i
sit
without
taking
another
sip
the
less
and
less
i
like
the
aftertaste
just
not
quite
right
the
feel
is
weird
too
with
the
head
being
thick
like
taffy
and
the
body
of
the
beer
itself
being
much
thinner
and
way
under
carbonated
after
all
the
nitro
juice
is
gone
this
really
was
a
let
down
as
i
thought
itd
be
like
a
boddingtons
cream
or
something
but
this
is
way
inferior
to
those
in
the
end
i
can
get
through
a
can
okay
but
this
just
isnt
as
good
as
it
could
be
the
3
6
abv
is
curious
as
well
not
sure
if
its
a
pro
or
a
con
here
but
thats
inconsequential
at
this
point
soso
at
best
the
taste
took
its
time
to
arrive
because
of
the
coldness
but
it
turns
out
the
beer
is
slightly
malty
and
semisweet
throughout
fairly
smooth
in
texture
as
the
name
suggests
although
i
think
smoothbland
rather
than
smoothflow
would
suit
it
more
looks
great
but
im
sure
its
all
nitrogen
pretty
tame
without
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
and
the
feels
a
little
lame
basic
beer
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
drinkability
it
is
canned
british
ale
tasty
and
decent
but
nothing
special
enough
said
this
is
one
of
the
least
flavorful
beers
ive
ever
had
right
up
there
with
coors
light
this
review
is
therefore
sparse
as
i
just
dont
have
all
much
to
say
its
not
awful
certainly
as
being
awful
would
require
some
flavor
of
some
sort
its
just
hardly
even
there
c
o
this
beer
is
quite
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
all
night
long
the
smell
and
taste
could
be
a
little
stronger
but
the
mouthfeel
from
the
nitrocan
helps
to
keep
things
a
little
interesting
tetleys
was
once
the
embodiment
of
real
ale
now
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
damaging
testimony
to
the
state
of
beer
in
england
the
fact
that
an
ale
so
insipid
and
uninspired
can
be
a
topten
selling
brand
does
not
speak
highly
of
british
palates
however
i
will
concede
that
insofar
as
massproduced
beers
go
one
could
do
much
worse
that
is
in
no
way
an
endorsement
but
it
is
about
the
most
positive
thing
i
can
say
the
crack
immediately
caused
the
surge
a
massive
offgassing
of
what
i
assume
to
be
n2
it
is
always
good
to
read
directions
and
i
followed
theirs
to
the
letter
i
employed
a
gentle
glug
running
the
beer
down
the
side
of
the
tilted

where
it
began
a
beautiful
cascade
upon
arrival
at
the

i
was
left
with
a
dense
thick
finger
of
tawny
head
head

excellent

color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with

clarity
nose
had
a
pleasant
biscuit
malt
quality
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
thanks
to
the
n2
presence
it
was
light
in
its
flavor
a
biscuitcrackerlike
semisweetness
but
still
quite
pleasant
finish
was
likewise
semisweet
with
the
maltiness
lingering
well
after
the
swallow
the
low
abv
makes
it
a
sessionable
candidate
by
even
dings
standards
but
i
am
afraid
that
as
a
hophead
i
would
need
more
bitterness
to
sustain
me
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
you
could
literally
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
with
the
low
abv
and
light
body
a
very
mild
flavor
and
aroma
to
this
beer
but
still
quite
enjoyable
overall

tastes
alot
like

light
and

very
smooth
and
sessionable
at
only

not
very
good
doesnt
live
up
to
its
description
as
an
english
bitter
the
mild
aroma
and
flavour
are
bland
and
characterless
looks
the
part
and
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
overall
this
is
just
dull
another
macro
ale
with
a
nitrogen
gimick
give
it
a
miss
from

it
is
a
nitro
can
so
the
head
explodes
into
the
pint
glass
and
nearly
engulfs
the
whole
glass
once
it
settles
down
it
has
the
appearance
of
medium
amber
with
fine
clarity
the
aroma
is
full
of
sugarsweetened
malts
but
little
in
the
way
of
hops
the
body
is
light
like
a
3

abv
beer
should
be
this
has
a
decent
bitter
flavor
with
an
accompanying
smooth
sweetness
o
mild
english
bitter
taken
too
far
incredibly
easy
to
drink
but
pretty
boring
stuff
pours
amber
with
a
one
inch
off
white
head
that
lasts
all
the
way
down
fair
amount
of
lacings
smell
is
grains
and
malt
taste
is
malty
with
a
fair
amount
of
bitter
hops
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
creamy
with
minimal
carbonation
fair
imitation
of
a

this
is
the
original
session
pub
ale
o
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
there
but
there
isnt
anything
unpleasant
an
easy
beer
to
sit
on
and
have
a
few
through
the
evening
especially
with
the
lower
abv
its
not
a
great
beer
but
its
better
than
average
and
by
the
end
of
it
i
wanted
and
had
another
tetleys
is
undoubtedly
my
favourite
mild
and
probably
my
favourite
low
abv
beer
overall
its
great
for
lunch
meals
or
any
other
time
you
may
want
a
decent
malty
taste
without
catching
too
much
of
a
buzz
drink
the
beer
really
has
a
fantastic
look
and
is
a
nice
easy
drinker
i
could
easily
session
this
beer
all
night
long
worth
seeking
out
overall
its
pretty
similar
to
boddingtons
pours
amber
with
a
one
inch
off

lasts
all
the

this
is
the
original
session
pub
ale
overall
a
very
decent
beer
that
is
just
tasty
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
in
its
category
overall
a
decent
nitro
ale
d
nice
foamy
head
thanks
to
the
nitrogen
the
flavor
is
an
appealing
mix
of
grain
and
breakfast
tea
a
nice
pleasant
enough
and
refreshing
mild
bitter
like
those
lowfat
snacks
that
still
taste
good
huh
you
just
want
to
and
will
consume
more
of
it
my
only
prior
experience
with
this
offering
was
an
unexpected
foray
into
the
lunchtime
wait
line
at
a
fish
n
chips
shop
in
a
working
class
area
of
my
city
while
me
and
me
mates
one
of
them
was
an
expat
so
well
there
stood
around
we
were
unexpectedly
offered
a
pint
to
while
the
time
away
and
this
was
one
of
the
very
limited
options
it
kept
us
blissfully
happy
is
all
i
can
say
notes
what
really
is
distinguishable
about
this
is
the
mouthfeel
pretty
light
but
extremely
creamy
interesting
beer
thats
worth
a
try
seems
to
fall
in
the
category
of
a
good
transitional
beer
d
very
drinkable
but
better
on
tap
d
goes
down
easy
theres
just
not
much
there
selling
me
on
this
beer
a
wonderful
beer
light
body
with
a
creamy
head
almost
flat
carbonation
very
smooth
and
creamy
without
any
heaviness
this
and
its
pleasant
but
simple
flavour
profile
make
it
really
easy
to
drink
a
clean
tasting
brew
at
such
low
abv
is
extremely
sessionable
d
very
low
abv
and
mild
flavor
make
this
a
decent
session
choice
not
really
a
top
choice
in
my
book
though
availability
was
the
main
factor
driving
this
purchase
it
was
the
best
available
at
the
quick
stop
and
they
were
sold
out
of
guinness
what
a
great
looking
beer
the
solid
white
head
rests
over
a
dark
amber
body
some
solid
lacing
is
left
on
the
half
pint
glass
as
the
beer
quickly
disappears
very
creamy
texture
some
floral
hop
notes
on
the
nose
a
chalky
dryness
on
the
palate
i
really
enjoyed
the
half
but
i
wonder
whether
i
could
do
to
many
enjoyed
it
at
a
saracens
rugby
match
on
vacation
d
not
a
terrible
beer
and
one
that
icould
drink
plenty
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
that
could
replace
this
one
on
the
next
round
d
the
menthol
flavor
is
quite
weird
but
on
a
hot
day
it
could
be
a
pretty
quenching
ale
i
suppose
you
could
say
it
is
the
newport
of
beers
this
brew
pours
very
well
into
my
pint
glass
a
very
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
very
creamy
head
that
sticks
around
the
whole
way
down
this
beer
is
a
low
to
medium
bodyas
for
mouthfeel
i
thought
it
was
rather
watered
down
but
went
down
smooth
great
flavor
overall
but
the
wateryness
takes
a
little
away
from
the
malt
finishes
slightly
dry
very
drinkable
beeri
enjoy
this
brew
and
recommend
to
all
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
not
a
bad
bitter
highly
drinkable
and
no
real
low
points
other
comments
what
can
i
say
its
a
nitrocan
i
hope
no
camra
members
spot
the
fact
that
i
drank
a
nitrocan
and
revoke
my
membership
this
is
really
a
gently
drinkable
beer
of
very
little
character
the
nitro
softens
everything
to
a
gentle
almost
tasteless
foam
all
in
all
its
a
laid
back
beer
with
a
pleasant
enough
vanilla
caramel
flavour
not
a
quality
drink
but
nothing
revolting
about
it
o
a
good
refreshing
summer
drink
fortunately
we
are
having
an
unusual
warm
spell
at
the
moment
so
it
is
welcome
to
drink
something
this
fruity
my
main
issue
is
that
it
is
listed
as
an
english
bitter
but
there
is
too
much
fruit
flavor
and
not
enough
malt
dominance
for
it
to
be
comfy
in
that
category
imo
however
i
did
selfserve
it
at
40
degrees
though
with
a
light
bitterness
good
carbonation
levels
