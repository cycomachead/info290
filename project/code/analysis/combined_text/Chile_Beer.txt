the

is
an

with
a
halo
of
white

of
caramel
and
crystal
sweetness
with
only
hints
of

if
you
dig
flavors
are

the
jalapeno

and

a
building

smooth

finish
solid
take
on
a
tough
style
to
keep
balanced
had
this
one
on
a
past
ticking
trip
to
asheville
served
from
tap
into
a
thirsty
monk
shaker
poured
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
jalepano
smoke
earth
and
earth
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
jalepano
subtle
smoke
earth
hop
and
a
spicy
followthrough
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
one
while
at
thirsty
monk
as
i
had
never
heard
of
it
but
i
have
always
been
intrigued
by
chile
beers
this
one
had
all
the
usual
characteristics
of
the
style
including
the
heat
on
the
followthrough
however
i
really
wish
there
would
have
been
a
little
more
sweetness
going
on
rather
than
just
earthy
spice
it
would
have
definitely
made
this
one
much
more
enjoyable
quite
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
would
suggest
it
for
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
great
chile
beer
they
added
just
the
right
amount
of
heat
to
an
already
solid
apa
its
definitely
worth
trying
amber
pour
bordering
on
a
light
brown
with
a
smooth
even
and
small
head
that
did
its
best
to
not
really
fade
that
much
at
all
aroma
is
lots
of
earth
grains
light
hops
and
a
touch
of
rye
like
spice
not
much
pepper
at
all
in
the
aroma
this
comes
much
later
as
you
take
a
sip
it
has
all
the
marks
of
a
nicely
done
esb
or
amber
but
gives
you
that
nice
kick
of
chili
pepper
in
the
finish
that
lets
you
know
its
there
o
great
spicy
esb
perfect
amount
of
spice
pours
deep
yellow
with
a
tad
of
orange
a
huge
frothy
off
white
head
tops
the
beer
and
refuses
to
dissipate
when
it
does
it
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
in
its
wake
there
is
a
ton
of
jalapeño
pepper
in
the
nose
it
is
super
fresh
raw
jalapeño
and
not
what
one
would
get
from
a
jar
of
the
peppers
swimming
in
vinegar
first
sip
is
light
bodied
but
crisp
like
the
base
beer
but
make
no
mistake
the
emmy
here
goes
to
the
super
fresh
jalapeño
pepper
it
hits
first
then
slightly
subsides
and
then
hits
again
with
a
super
strong
finish
that
borders
on
harsh
but
does
not
cross
the
line
it
will
leave
your
throat
slightly
irritated
but
not
to
the
point
of
discomfort
but
rather
in
a
pleasant
awakening
that
lovingly
lingers
very
unique
very
tastya
masterpiece
the
smell
is
incredible
very
strong
pepper
smell
from
the
get
go
overall
this
was
a
bit
too
hit
for
me
a
small
glass
was
enough
overall
i
sort
of
hope
that
the
veggie
bits
were
a
mistake
and
not
the
norm
as
i
found
lots
of
potential
in
every
other
corner
of
this
beer
reddish
gold
appearance
still
no
head
it
smells
of
burn
and
strong
pepper
maybe
some
banana
pepper
pepper
start
with
a
pepper
taste
then
just
a
big
burn
of
my
throat
overwhelming
everything
i
personally
can
not
handle
this
one
at
all
to
even
try
and
find
taste
other
then
pain
and
pepper
if
you
love
peppers
which
many
do
this
beer
is
for
you
but
i
just
cant
do
this
one
the
mouth
is
fine
but
a
definite
one
off
for
me
this
is
the
first
time
ive
needed
a
beer
to
chase
another
beer
with
verdict
i
love
spicy
food
so
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
thier
email
anouncing
its
release
called
this
their
most
drinkable
version
of
wildfire
to
date
and
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that
but
its
still
not
for
those
who
cant
handle
the
heat
there
wasnt
excessive
face
sweating
like
the
ale
version
if
i
could
i
think
i
would
have
one
of
these
every
night
i
went
out
good
stuff
and
yet
its
quite
good
for
what
it
is
which
is
nothing
like
anything
else
my
lips
are
ablaze
and
i
havent
touched
it

i
take
it
that
this
was
a
reasonably
fresh
bottle
its
the
new
label
also
well
this
is
exactly
what
it
purports
to
be
a
serrano
pepperdosed
ale
i
cant
front
on
that
all
i
can
do
is
deal
with
the
aftershocks
the
detritus
and
the
mess
that
is
my
palate
after
making
my
way
through
it
not
overly
spicy
but
full
and
engaging
in
its
spiciness
if
that
makes
any
sense
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
as
for
an
amber
ale
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
great
example
but
for
a
pepperspiced
beer
its
pretty
good
and
it
does
a
good
job
at
showcasing
the
serrano
peppers
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
a
little
smooth
a
little
spicy
crisp
fairly
dry
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
know
the
heat
would
start
to
wear
on
me
so
one
would
be
my
limit
and
i
think
half
the
bottle
would
be
the
perfect
amount
for
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
serrano
pepper
flavor
it
was
very
nice
and
just
what
i
expect
from
that
type
of
pepper
it
was
spicy
but
it
wasnt
too
hot
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
i
wish
the
amber
ale
base
stuck
out
a
little
more
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
only
once
in
a
while
since
it
isnt
the
type
of
beer
that
i
would
drink
often
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
pepper
beer
fan
its
got
a
good
balance
of
spicy
and
pepper
flavors
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
very
similar
to
how
it
was
when
i
tried
it
on
tap
a
couple
years
ago
but
i
think
this
one
had
just
a
little
more
heat
than
i
remember
it
isnt
my
favorite
saugatuck
beer
but
it
is
my
favorite
pepper
beer
since
theres
a
lot
of
nice
serrano
flavors
without
too
much
overpowering
heat
good
job
guys
this
was
one
nice
pepper
beer
keep
up
the
good
and
creative
work
this
one
surprised
me
good
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
cloudy
amberred
color
its
very
easy
drinking
not
overly
spicy
but
just
a
nice
even
pepper
flavor
it
was
great
for
a
fall
day
on
the
deck
after
lunch
this
would
be
good
mixed
into
some
hamburger
and
cooked
on
the
grill
with
some
pepperjack
cheese
spice
beers
are
not
for
everyone
this
one
drinks
well
with
a
pepper
flavor
at
the
end
not
too
strong
or
overwhelming
like
many
spiced
beers
good
with
food
chili
tailgating
very
enjoyable
had
a
pint
of
serrano
at
the
farmhouse
in
chicago
with
lunch
last
week
nice
spice
but
not
too
much
bite
it
paired
well
with
my
fish
and
chips
love
it
o
id
categorize
this
as
a
chili
beer
rather
than
an
amber
ale
the
peppers
take
center
stage
and
overshadow
other
characteristics
the
chili
beers
i
enjoy
most
always
include
some
other
component
chocolate
herbs
fruit
while
i
can
give
a
nod
to
the
straight
forward
rendition
its
not
my
favorite
kind
of
like
a
band
where
i
dont
care
for
the
style
but
i
know
theyre
good
at
what
theyre
doing
pours
an
amber
orange
color
without
much
of
a
head
on
it
nose
is
spicy
serrano
peppers
fresh
from
st
croix
and
some
caramel
malts
taste
is
similar
to
the
jose
starts
off
sweet
citrus
and
a
little
bit
of
the
pepper
this
moves
on
to
caramel
malts
and
are
overtaken
by
the
spicy
fresh
peppers
ends
with
the
fresh
peppers
almost
like
having
an
amber
ale
and
choosing
it
with
a
pepper
mouth
is
creamy
full
and
a
little
spritzy
overall
this
is
a
nice
change
up
of
a
beer
the
peppers
add
a
nice
element
of
flavor
that
isnt
usually
there
recommended
first
off
the
bottle
on
this
one
is
a
keeper
i
dont
typically
keep
my
empties
but
this
one
is
just
too
perfect
to
not
keep
on
display
i
didnt
really
get
much
on
the
nose
aside
from
your
regular
roasty
stout
aromas
but
the
taste
is
where
it
really
comes
across
well
first
off
its
a
perfectly
solid
base
stout
probably
one
of
the
tastier
and
more
balanced
stouts
ive
had
in
recent
memory
so
rogue
totally
got
that
right
when
it
comes
to
the
spice
element
its
not
overbearing
in
the
least
and
it
marries
nicely
with
the
roastiness
of
the
stout
i
was
a
bit
worried
before
tasting
only
because
sriracha
definitely
has
a
more
unique
spicesweetness
profile
that
i
wasnt
sure
would
work
like
your
average
chile
beer
but
this
one
does
it
the
heat
and
spice
doesnt
overshadow
the
stout
itself
and
the
stout
doesnt
take
away
from
the
heat
and
spice
its
a
perfect
balance
of
flavors
in
my
mind
and
this
is
a
hot
beer
that
id
glad
go
back
to
again
oh
my
lord
god
horrendous
the
claim
that
a
human
being
would
enjoy
this
type
of
flavor
infused
with
beer
is
baffling
to
me
wow
heartburn
in
a
bottle
sickening
and
i
like
spice
very
much
in
my
food
my
wife
comes
from
thailand
so
my
palate
is
accustomed
to
heat
but
this
this
is
an
abomination
its
so
gross
that
if
youre
reading
this
i
beg
you
to
try
it
believe
me
its
an
experience
thinbodied
stout
with
slow
back
of
throat
burn
not
as
spicy
as
i
feared
split
the
bottle
and
barely
finished
my
half
you
know
i
would
never
drink
a
whole
one
of
these
i
couldnt
even
finish
a
glass
but
you
simply
have
to
respect
it
for
one
the
base
stout
is
exceptional
and
an
awesome
platform
for
the
spice
not
overrun
with
chocolate
or
coffee
notes
and
low
enough
in
alcohol
for
that
not
to
be
a
distraction
i
also
admire
the
authenticity
of
the
hot
sauce
itself
sriracha
is
a
unique
flavor
much
more
than
just
heat
and
all
of
that
really
comes
through
nicely
i
think
that
said
its
way
to
hot
for
me
my
palate
anyway
to
be
suitable
as
anything
more
than
an
ingredient
hardly
an
appealing
beverage
but
i
say
that
about
almost
all
chili
beer
the
base
stout
really
works
for
me
though
and
this
might
even
be
good
if
the
heat
was
scaled
back
by
half
or
so
because
there
is
a
void
there
that
the
pepper
sauce
fills
extremely
well
but
it
just
gets
overwhelming
its
cool
they
continue
to
experiment
and
with
all
the
cult
followers
of
this
sauce
and
its
awesome
packaging
it
should
sell
well
but
for
me
this
is
a
novelty
item
even
though
the
beer
it
starts
with
is
very
well
done
worth
trying
for
the
heat
junkies
out
there
well
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
im
going
to
get
a
sec
ond
bottle
soon
roasty
with
huge
chocolate
and
a
light
lingering
burning
especially
in
the
finish
i
finished
a
pint
of
this
and
enjoyed
it
but
its
not
something
i
could
drink
often
my
liver
hurts
dammit
how
could
i
not
try
this
stuff
it
pours
a
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
mild
coffee
and
the
vaguest
possible
hint
of
sriracha
sauce
though
this
one
might
be
psychosomatic
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
after
the
finish
a
wave
of
peppery
heat
lines
my
throat
not
much
flavor
mixing
here
which
keeps
things
from
devolving
into
crazily
bad
things
happening
on
my
tongue
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
this
could
have
been
a
helluva
lot
worse
than
it
turned
out
to
be
its
basically
a
meek
basic
stout
that
happens
to
hold
some
pepper
heat
buried
within
it
nothing
godawful
but
nothing
really
worth
drinking
again
either
there
is
a
kick
definitely
at
the
end
its
not
a
super
strong
sriracha
taste
it
is
something
you
need
to
try
ive
had
quite
a
few
hot
pepper
beers
that
have
been
incredible
and
i
wish
the
style
was
more
main
stream
with
readily
available
options
however
this
was
off
the
mark
smell
was
off
putting
and
lingering
aftertaste
was
horrible
almost
a
drain
pour
i
did
enjoy
the
burn
rogue
beers
always
seem
hit
or
miss
disappointed
particularly
considering
the
high
price
point
great
beer
i
was
skeptical
at
first
but
great
taste
the
spicy
finish
was
nice
it
went
well
with
the
stout
just
spicy
enough
i
was
worried
it
might
be
more
than
id
like
but
it
just
hits
the
back
of
your
throat
very
slightly
it
spewed
a
bit
when
i
popped
the
top
so
be
prepared
for
that
unlike
i
was
a
few
paper
towels
later
i
was
good
to
go
i
bought
a
bottle
just
to
try
it
after
the
first
sip
you
could
feel
the
heat
slide
down
your
throat
id
probably
try
it
again
with
some
spicy
food
but
the
bottle
was
way
too
big
and
pricey
o
a
good
base
that
gets
the
spicy
sriracha
treatment
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
if
you
put
sriracha
into
a
straightforward
stout
never
gets
overwhelming
or
overdone
in
any
way
which
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
especially
with
a
good
food
pairing
that
goes
well
with
spicesriracha
it
might
be
a
novelty
beer
but
its
not
bad
at
all
in
fact
pretty
good
poured
into
snifter
pours
two
fingers
dark
brown
soapy
head
great
retention
fading
into
a
consistent
film
and
decent
sticky
lacing
pitch
black
smells
of
rich
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
lightly
spicy
starts
off
tasting
a
lot
like
a
standard
stout
with
cocoa
chocolate
and
the
aftertaste
introduces
the
sriracha
the
more
i
sip
it
the
more
spice
i
pick
up
great
balance
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
firebomb
creamy
smooth
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
tickling
spiciness
lingering
on
far
back
of
tongue
a
little
chewy
nice
quality
brew
i
bought
it
thinking
it
was
some
sort
of
joke
but
it
definitely
holds
its
own
would
buy
again
solid
stout
with
strong
chili
pepper
finish
actually
a
very
nice
beer
the
spice
just
tickles
the
back
of
your
throat
this
would
be
great
with
a
pepperoni
pizza
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
really
good
not
too
spicy
but
spicy
enough
i
might
buy
it
again
sriracha

with
a

there
is

good

overall
its

full
of

flavors
nice
chocolate
roasted
smokey
backbone
but
a
funky
finish
starts
out
chocolaty
smooth
then
the
bomb
literately
goes
off
and
you
get
blast
of
hotness
pepper
and
tingle
for
a
5
abv
this
beer
packs
a
punch
looks
like
a
stout
doesnt
smell
overly
hot
taste
is
different
no
problems
with
it
just
wish
this
girl
had
more
to
her
a
different
kind
of
spicy
from
the
usual
pepper
stout
rogues
sriracha
stout
mixes
a
good
base
stout
that
holds
its
flavor
against
the
spicy
and
smoky
character
of
the
sauce
its
not
cheap
but
it
is
a
well
executed
pepper
stout
i
tried
this
on
a
tasting
i
liked
itbut
i
wouldnt
buy
it
it
had
potential
overall
a
decent
amount
of
heat
but
not
great
flavor
on
a
base
stout
the
look
is
good
but
the
smell
and
taste
and
feel
are
all
off
not
a
fan
it
was
nice
for
the
novelty
but
i
wouldnt
waste
anymore
money
on
this
beer
all
gimmick
and
nothing
to
back
it
up
a
very
disappointing
beer
for
the
price
i
like
a
spiced
and
sometimes
spicy
beer
but
this
missed
the
mark
after
reviewing
a
few
more
beers
i
decided
i
had
originally
been
too
generous
with
this
save
your
money
friends
quite
a
thin
and
dry
stout
with
a
decent
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
gentle
carbonation
hard
to
ignore
the
mellow
heat
in
the
otherwise
malty
finish
this
was
another
case
study
in
having
low
expectations
and
being
pleasantly
surprised
at
least
for
me
seems
a
good
policy
with
anything
gimmicky
from
rogue
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
off
white
tightly
beaded
head
deep
roasted
malt
aroma
slight
cocoa
and
just
a
hint
of
pepper
then
hints
of
smoke
the
flavor
is
roasted
and
coffee
like
with
a
small
building
heat
from
the
peppers
in
the
finish
i
think
i
have
sriracha
flavored
tooth
paste
now
that
i
think
about
it
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
tan
head
that
stuck
around
a
while
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
some
smokiness
and
srirachapeppers
i
think
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
the
srirachapepper
heat
is
stronger
in
comparision
to
the
aroma
with
that
being
said
this
brew
isnt
quite
as
spicy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
i
think
its
nice
and
tasty
it
does
have
a
good
kick
to
it
and
it
is
spicier
than
most
chile
beers
ive
tried
however
the
spiciness
isnt
overpowering
and
it
doesnt
linger
around
for
a
real
long
time
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
it
has
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
its
easy
enough
to
drink
i
thought
this
was
a
good
chile
beer
it
has
a
good
amount
of
spice
but
it
wasnt
too
much
id
buy
this
again
for
sure
absolutely
stunning
thank
you
rogue
thank
you
sriracha
comes
through
on
the
nose
p
ngers
on
the
pallette
with
a
spice
that
isnt
overwhelming
but
delivers
on
the
promise
sriracha
stout
is
an
awesome
combo
first
off
i
am
not
going
to
do
a
traditional
review
as
i
was
unable
to
experience
it
accurately
with
the
spice
i
truly
appreciated
how
well
executed
this
beer
is
for
what
they
were
going
after
it
really
is
if
sriracha
and
beer
had
some
weird
demonic
child
i
had
no
desire
to
drink
more
than
the
2
ounce
sample
i
tried
i
feel
it
would
have
been
a
great
stout
if
it
wasnt
spicy
who
actually
drinks
spicy
beer
its
just
a
novelty
in
my
humble
opinion
but
at
least
beard
beer
was
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
more
of
a
chocolate
taste
than
spicy
for
me
this
is
balanced
enough
where
i
could
drink
a
full
bottle
of
this
myself
and
not
be
over
powered
by
the
spice
i
definitely
want
another
bottle
of
this
if
you
see
it
get
it
pours
a
deep
brownishblack
with
very
nice
tan
head
and
decent
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
some
malt
sweetness
taste
is
pretty
darn
good
first
is
a
hit
of
strong
coffee
and
then
fades
into
a
slight
chili
burn
actually
not
a
burn
but
it
is
right
to
that
edge
still
tasty
but
not
overpowering
of
chili
the
balance
and
complexity
seems
to
be
lacking
somewhat
on
this
one
but
overall
simply
put
if
you
are
a
coffee
and
a
hot
chili
fan
this
beer
is
for
you
nice
carbonation
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
depth
and
balance
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
heat
in
the
back
of
the
throat
unfortunately
the
base
stout
is
subpar
to
keep
this
from
actually
being
really
good
this
spicy
golden
goose
pairs
great
with
gumbo
hard
to
rate
this
beer
sriracha
flavor
does
come
through
very
unique
not
great
but
not
bad
either
pours
and
looks
fantastic
sriracha
not
evident
on
the
nose
but
quickly
dominates
the
palate
without
ever
becoming
overbearing
and
undrinkable
given
the
low
abv
its
not
all
that
bad
but
the
price
point
13
makes
it
a
little
excessive
unless
youre
collecting
items
for
a
bottleshare
beer
pours
black
tinged
with
brown
and
forms
a
large
brown
head
very
nice
aroma
seems
mild
at
first
but
upon
close
inspection
there
is
definitely
kind
of
a
caustic
thing
going
on
here
similarly
the
flavor
starts
out
very
mild
and
almost
like
an
ordinary
stout
with
a
subtle
jalapeño
note
in
the
background
but
the
heat
grows
as
it
lingers
in
my
mouth
finishes
by
covering
my
mouth
and
throat
with
a
bowl
of
jalapeños
not
too
spicy
to
handle
but
definitely
doesnt
leave
room
for
beer
flavor
and
ill
probably
be
drinking
this
pretty
slowly
for
the
rest
of
the
night
i
dont
feel
like
i
can
judge
the
malt
fairly
but
it
seems
like
a
pretty
good
base
on
its
own
creamy
roasty
even
a
little
nutty
but
then
it
vanishes
behind
a
wall
of
chili
although
as
a
person
who
eats
sriracha
on
just
about
everything
this
is
one
of
the
coolest
bottles
that
i
now
own
weak
stout
with
a
bunch
of
heat
ive
had
a
few
of
this
style
before
this
is
probably
the
worst
an
outstanding
stoutwith
a
really
weird
but
tasty
nonetheless
i
loved
this
beer
its
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
this
was
my
first
chile
beer
overallil
give
sriracha
hot
stout
rogue
ales
a
sriracha
hot
stout
rogue
ales
this
would
graciously
compliment
any
spicier
dish
overall
even
with
subdued
expectations
i
walked
away
disappointed
this
thing
really
needed
to
have
a
sweeter
malt
base
to
compliment
the
heat
instead
we
get
heavy
earthy
character
that
pairs
oddly
with
the
sriracha
flavors
as
a
sriracha
fan
i
had
to
try
this
but
now
with
curiosity
sated
i
shant
return
3
535
the
sriracha
integration
is
shockingly
impressive
nice
work
rogue
didnt
get
a
lot
of
chile
on
the
nose
loved
that
this
tasted
like
a
normal
stout
until
the
chile
hit
after
the
swallow
tastes
like
a
cup
of
coffee
with
a
dash
of
hot
sauce
not
bad
but
pricey
for
what
you
get
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
during
a
bottle
share
into
a
snifter
chocolate
dark
brown
with
tan
head
that
dissipated
smells
like
chocolate
coffee
and
a
hint
of
pepper
or
spice
tastes
oddly
unlike
its
name
traditional
coffee
stout
on
the
front
but
you
do
get
that
sriracha
hot
sauce
flavor
on
the
back
end
and
aftertaste
i
certainly
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
glass
not
bad
not
great
o
this
is
simply
a
marketing
gimmick
no
sincere
thought
or
effort
given
here
id
rather
have
a
bud
lite
limearita
well
i
cant
cite
faults
in
advertising
with
this
one
so
rogue
is
already
ahead
of
the
game
there
with
me
my
expectations
for
hot
sauceenabled
foodstuffs
are
rather
stringent
i
e
lots
of
it
but
dont
be
stupid
about
it
and
i
believe
that
theyve
more
or
less
got
it
right
here
maybe
the
base
stout
shakespeare
could
be
a
tad
sweeter
in
its
balancing
effort
but
whatever
it
works
one
of
the
worst
aftertastes
ive
experienced
in
a
stout
overall
the
heat
level
is
spot
on
its
not
insanely
spicy
like
some
but
you
can
tell
its
there
unlike
others
however
the
tastesmell
have
a
weird
smokiness
or
something
else
going
on
that
does
not
mesh
with
the
chilis
nor
my
personal
preferences
not
bad
but
not
great
overall
this
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
insane
hot
pepper
beers
ive
had
and
ones
with
no
heat
at
all
pretty
drinkable
and
with
that
sriracha
burn
as
a
hot
sauce
lover
this
ones
definitely
not
bad
4
wasnt
really
my
style
might
go
good
as
marinate
for
a
steak
pours
dark
smells
like
chili
with
a
little
hint
of
chocolate
it
has
a
burn
on
the
backside
the
bottle
is
the
best
part
of
it
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
best
hot
pepper
beer
ive
had
since
3rd
waves
chili
pepper
porter
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
imo
rogue
is
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
one
is
in
the
middle
looks
great
inky
black
with
some
lacing
it
honesty
smells
like
a
pack
of
black
cat
m80s
peppery
and
spicy
not
a
knock
at
all
just
takes
me
to
that
place
plenty
of
malt
with
a
little
heat
at
the
end
flavor
and
heat
lingers
on
the
tongue
for
a
few
minutes
definitely
in
a
pleasant
way
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
slick
not
a
great
beer
but
good
and
satisfying
nice
and
dark
as
id
expect
from
a
stout
has
all
the
smells
youd
expect
from
a
stout
roasted
malt
scent
with
a
hint
of
spice
maybe
a
bit
of
smoke
roasted
flavors
hint
of
garlic
and
smoke
and
then
a
spicy
kick
at
the
end
decent
stout
feel
here
man
i
was
very
apprehensive
about
this
going
in
and
its
weird
but
oddly
satisfying
the
spice
isnt
overpowering
nor
underwhelming
bizarrely
good
slight
tingle
at
the
end
from
the
sriracha
not
at
all
overpowering
very
long
finish
not
rogues
best
stout
not
by
a
mile
very
weird
brew
lots
of
pepper
spice
taste
especially
garlic
at
least
to
me
with
some
roasty
and
chocolate
stouts
flavors
in
the
background
not
overwhelmingly
hot
mostly
just
a
little
burn
in
the
finish
cool
idea
but
not
the
best
im
getting
the
smoked
peppers
but
little
else
tasty
stuff
the
pour
is
good
orange
colourtwo
fingers
of
foamy
head
a
bit
murky
there
is
a
definite
smoky
chipotle
nose
just
enough
to
let
you
know
what
you
are
getting
into
the
flavour
is
very
pleasant
a
solid
caramel
malt
base
with
just
enough
smoke
and
pepper
heat
it
is
far
from
overpowering
and
in
my
books
very
well
done
i
dont
drink
many
beers
like
this
but
i
could
certainly
acquire
a
taste
for
them
this
beer
was
mediochre
at
best
it
was
way
too
earthy
and
was
fairly
flavorless
aside
from
a
little
bit
of
chile
pepper
spiciness
definitely
would
not
recommend
this
beer
overall
yet
again
a
pretty
standard
beer
from
rogue
for
au14
for
a
650ml
bottle
not
worth
that
price
and
an
average
chilli
beer
i
havent
had
a
great
rogue
beer
yet
after
having
a
fresh
chili
pepper
porter
from
3rd
wave
and
falling
in
love
maybe
im
biased
this
beer
did
not
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
lacking
pepper
flavor
all
together
a
very
nice
smoked
chipotle
flavour
not
much
heat
though
sweet
malty
taste
is
the
backbone
to
this
beer
medium
carbonation
super
spicy
was
not
my
cup
i
tea
but
taste
is
subjective
me
personaly
i
didnt
care
for
it
and
will
not
purchase
again
there
is
a
smokeness
from
the
chipotle
peppers
with
little
heat
it
is
not
overpowering
great
smoke
and
flavor
from
the
chipotle
but
very
little
heat
which
gives
a
great
balance
pairs
well
with
chili
or
most
spicy
dishes
also
great
to
cook
with
a
somewhat
sharp
heat
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
vile
and
tastes
like
an
ashtray
in
a
mexican
restaurant
yeah
this
was
light
on
alcohol
but
thats
not
what
youre
going
to
notice
about
this
beer
should
you
be
fortunate
enough
to
finish
this
off
my
friend
couldnt
do
that
with
his
allotment
so
i
ended
up
drinking
his
share
as
well
as
what
was
left
in
the
bottle
while
not
a
drain
pour
this
is
not
a
beer
for
most
people
and
should
only
be
tried
to
satisfy
a
curiosity
probably
something
i
wouldnt
try
again
but
nevertheless
glad
that
i
had
once
and
one
of
the
few
beers
that
cries
out
for
a
meal
to
go
along
with
it
clearly
not
one
of
rogues
better
offerings
nice
head
smells
smokey
real
smokey
taste
is
what
i
expect
smokey
smokey
not
much
heat
maybe
a
little
on
the
finish
it
was
a
good
tasting
beer
but
i
was
looking
for
some
heat
not
so
much
smoke
flavor
might
buy
again
and
pair
it
with
food
too
smoky
overall
but
has
a
watery
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
although
i
will
admit
i
was
hoping
for
more
heat
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
immediately
noticed
the
smoked
profile
of
the
peppers
this
also
played
alot
into
the
silky
mouthfeel
as
the
beer
warmed
this
is
my
first
review
so
please
bear
with
me
cheers
im
trying
to
figure
out
if
this
version
of
the
beer
has
changed
much
if
at
all
from
prior
years
because
it
was
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
the
appearance
of
the
poor
was
a
dark
amber
hue
with
a
light
head
the
smell
was
smokey
with
a
little
bit
of
pepper
mixed
in
with
the
hops
and
malt
smells
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
what
i
love
the
most
about
the
beer
the
taste
is
deeply
smokey
with
just
a
little
bit
of
spice
on
the
back
of
the
throat
it
makes
the
beer
an
easy
pairing
with
spanish
and
indian
food
the
mouthfeel
as
well
coats
your
cheeks
so
that
theres
a
light
tingle
from
the
spice
overall
was
very
nice
and
for
the
price
i
found

pepper
heat
and
no
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
light
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
chile
beer
all
around
good
balance
and
robustness
of
malt
pepper
and
light
hop
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
with
the
minimal
heat
from
the
peppers
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
decent
pepper
beer
certainly
drinkable
not
overly
spicy
overall
ive
only
had
a
few
pepper
beers
and
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
so
far
serving
type
bottle
o
not
an
offensive
chile
beer
not
a
style
i
love
but
drinkable
none
the
same
best
shared
with
a
friend
agreed
that
its
not
the
chile
beer
with
the
most
heat
thats
because
it
tastes
like
actual
chipotle
peppers
smooth
and
mildly
hoppy
nose
moderate
carbonation
with
warming
chipotle
finish
i
would
argue
that
the
spicier
beers
are
more
of
a
novelty
whereas
this
one
is
more
genuinely
tasty
and
drinkable
if
you
like
that
kind
of
thing
of
course
its
not
for
everyone
pretty
decent
spiced
ale
actually
better
than
i
expected
pretty
good
flavor
and
worth
trying
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
smoked
malt
bandaid
chipotle
pepper
and
slight
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
smoke
chipotle
and
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
smoke
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
smoke
and
chipotle
presence
that
comes
across
better
in
the
flavor
but
it
lacks
any
sort
of
heat
for
a
chile
beer
overall
i
really
dug
this
a
bomber
is
probably
enough
for
the
palate
but
the
overall
session
was
very
enjoyable
the
right
amount
of
peppers
is
key
and
the
rogue
crew
nailed
it
here
im
still
getting
a
little
heat
and
numbing
of
the
gums
as
i
write
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
rogue
beers
and
one
i
will
be
hitting
up
again
this
is
actually
a
decent
spicy
beer
with
the
right
amount
of
heat
wont
seek
out
again
because
id
just
rather
have
something
else
but
theres
a
lot
of
room
for
error
and
they
avoided
all
of
it
so
thats
definitely
commendable
interesting
beer
i
liked
the
fact
they
limited
the
amount
of
chipotle
added
to
the
recipe
and
its
hops
helps
to
refresh
it
that
would
be
a
great
beer
to
mix
on
a
blind
taste
session
it
is
the
kind
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
sure
i
would
seek
this
again
but
i
would
sure
drink
it
again
if
it
knocks
my
door
overall
something
different
thats
not
too
different
if
you
were
to
drink
this
without
knowing
what
it
was
you
would
know
that
it
was
with
some
sort
of
pepper
but
its
not
too
pronounced
not
something
to
have
every
day
or
in
large
quantities
but
for
a
random
beer
every
once
in
a
while
its
good
this
is
a
great
flavored
beer
ive
had
a
few
chili
pepper
inspired
beers
in
the
past
and
usually
they
are
over
the
top
this
one
is
right
on
you
get
a
nice
and
very
distinct
chipotle
flavor
that
said
it
doesnt
overpower
the
nice
clean
underlying
ale
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
mix
in
to
a
tasting
due
to
its
distinctness
i
had
it
paired
with
some
local
cheeses
and
it
was
fantastic
this
isnt
an
every
night
beer
but
a
great
one
to
mix
it
up
a
bit
overall
a
solid
entry
into
the
spicedherbal
beers
from
rogue
worth
a
try
overall
its
odd
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
for
a
chile
beer
its
darn
tasty
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
particularly
sessionable
i
would
buy
it
again
i
wasnt
completely
sure
what
to
expect
when
i
had
this
beer
but
i
have
to
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
had
to
take
a
couple
sips
of
the
beer
before
i
could
really
notice
the
subtle
taste
of
the
peppers
but
it
adds
a
nice
little
kick
to
the
end
of
your
drink
paired
well
with
a
buffalo
chicken
pizza
o
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
very
long
time
im
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
find
one
im
not
sure
if
this
is
only
a
spring
beer
anymore
since
only
recently
i
saw
a
large
amount
added
to
bow
street
market
freeport
maine
i
guess
its
good
for
its
style
since
it
displays
the
normal
smell
and
taste
of
hot
and
spicy
food
the
mouthfeel
im
unsure
of
and
am
making
an
assumption
on
that
part
but
i
think
i
would
come
back
to
this
i
wonder
how
this
would
pair
with
chocolate
cake
at
dessert
o
not
super
impressed
by
this
one
the
smoke
was
nice
but
the
bandaid
really
killed
it
for
me
probably
wont
get
this
again
and
can
really
recommend
it
in
good
conscience
note
do
not
drink
this
beer
with
anything
that
is
chipotle
spiced
i
had
a
chipotle
spiced
chicken
burrito
homemade
and
it
completely
masked
this
beer
id
say
try
it
with
something
neutral
to
spice
up
your
meal
and
dont
worry
theres
no
noticeable
heat
in
this
brew
just
yummy
goodness
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
bit
it
comes
across
more
as
an
ingredient
rather
than
a
beer
it
has
good
flavor
if
you
love
chipotle
peppers
but
im
not
sure
i
would
ever
want
more
than
this
one
bomber
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
o
definitely
an
odd
experience
there
are
a
lot
of
things
going
on
in
this
beer
but
all
very
mild
and
the
flavors
do
not
meld
well
i
really
dont
like
this
beer
very
much
it
need
a
thicker
mouthfeel
more
sweetness
and
flavors
that
complement
each
other
a
bit
better
overall
was
underwhelmed
all
around
taste
of
liquid
smoke
not
chipolte
at
all
i
absolutely
love
spicy
peppers
and
food
and
this
is
neither
spicy
or
good
at
all
super
disappointed
full
disclosure
though
i
wouldnt
even
call
this
spicy
i
do
enjoy
really
spicy
food
and
the
feeling
you
get
from
it
overall
the
beer
has
some
good
flavors
and
feel
but
is
not
really
something
i
would
ever
pine
for
on
any
real
occasion
worth
a
try
but
nothing
exceptional
overy
interesting
take
on
an
ale
but
i
highly
recommend
drinking
with
food
with
some
kind
of
chipotle
seasoning
it
complements
so
well
that
they
should
sell
it
at
all
mexican
restaurants
overall
great
example
of
a
chile
and
pepper
action
in
a
brew
i
will
have
this
again
when
in
the
mood
since
this
is
only
the
second
chile
beer
ive
ever
had
its
hard
to
judge
this
one
but
i
can
say
for
sure
that
its
a
very
interesting
beer
its
a
nice
amber
colour
but
the
light
brown
head
disappears
very
quickly
and
theres
almost
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
the
chilies
really
come
through
in
the
smell
along
with
bready
malts
and
light
hops
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
but
this
is
where
the
chilies
really
shine
through
medium
body
nice
dry
finish
overall
a
good
beer
o
outstanding
i
cant
attest
to
this
as
a
stand
alone
beer
but
this
is
a
perfect
pairing
with
chipotle
based
cuisine
poured
into
a
glass
the
color
is
amber
with
a
large
white
head
smell
is
strong
with
a
nice
chile
bite
its
a
smooth
taste
the
chiles
are
apparent
and
its
well
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
average
the
spiciness
of
the
drink
lingers
though
which
is
a
nice
touch
tastesweet
toasted
malt
spices
subtle
smoked
peppers
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
sweet
malt
kept
from
becoming
cloying
by
just
right
amount
of
gently
warming
spices
and
smoked
peppers
this
brew
cries
out
for
spicy
mexican
or
szechuan
cuisine
overall
great
balance
flavor
and
a
match
for
any
spicy
dish
overall
a
very
unique
beer
but
it
succeeds
at
what
it
is
attempting
a
tasty
chili
beer
that
remains

like

the

this
one
just
falls
short
of
being
an
excellent
beer
definitely
was
worth
tasting
but
am
gonna
keep
looking
o
i
love
spicy
food
i
do
not
love
this
spicy
beer
there
are
too
extremes
spicy
and
sweet
battling
it
out
and
my
tastebuds
are
losing
i
would
not
recommend
o
different
but
drinkable
i
would
not
call
this
beer
sessionable
but
it
is
also
not
something
im
sorry
that
i
chose
or
disappointed
to
have
i
would
likely
not
get
this
beer
again
and
im
not
sure
there
are
really
any
beers
in
this
style
that
i
want
for
the
alcohol
is
not
very
noticeable
and
the
pepper
flavor
is
not
overly
hot
medium
creamy

decent
carbonation
a
bit

spiciness
but
finishes
clean
and
smooth
and
is
pairing
excellently
with
the
mexican
dish
i
am
eating
its
different
and
definitely
not
something
id
drink
every
day
but
it
was
enjoyable
o
good
chile
beer
definitely
recommend
picking
up
and
pairing
with
food
amber
color
with
a
thin

smokey

initial
taste
is
very
unusual
and
awkward
but
becomes
very
good
warm
full
bodied
spicy
finish
very
intriguing
beer
if
you
want
to
explore
but
not
something
you
would
drink
very
often
overall
not
my
favorite
rogue
in
any
way
but
its
alright
ive
had
better
spiceheavy
beers
and
even
a
couple
of
other
chipotlethemed
ones
at
the
price
tag
this
comes
with
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
bad
beer
either
im
sure
my
review
will
be
lower
than
the
average
since
there
are
tons
of
rogue
fanatics
out
there
but
i
just
wasnt
feeling
it
too
much
this
time
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
after
trying
it
i
can
say
i
definitely
like
the
style
and
find
it
right
up
my
alley
i
do
like
spicy
things
overall
and
having
this
makes
me
realize
it
can
work
fairly
well
in
beer
when
done
right
appearance
looks
like
a
normal
type
of
amber
ale
not
to
much
head
or
lacing
looks
nondescript
you
can
definitely
smell
some
of
the
pepper
and
it
gives
the
beer
a
slightly
smokey
scent
the
smell
is
interesting
i
cant
say
its
necessarily
appetizing
but
definitely
interesting
taste
wise
is
where
this
beer
shines
as
it
warms
the
pepper
and
spice
becomes
slightly
more
pronounced
and
gives
this
beer
a
bit
of
a
bite
that
i
find
to
be
really
satisfying
the
more
you
have
of
it
the
better
it
is
it
takes
a
little
getting
used
to
at
first
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
watery
side
but
the
same
time
the
carbonation
goes
great
with
the
spice
and
the
heat
of
it
makes
it
feel
quite
full
any
fuller
body
would
probably
make
this
feel
too
heavy
overall
i
quite
liked
this
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
everyday
but
certainly
good
o
very
interesting
mix
of
peppers
and
ale
would
deff
have
again
overall
its
something
to
try
even
if
it
does
not
sound
appetizing
a
chipotle
ale
does
not
sound
like
a
delicious
beer
to
drink
or
at
least
it
did
not
sound
good
to
me
before
i
tried
it
but
i
am
willing
to
try
everything
so
even
if
a
chipotle
ale
does
not
sound
like
a
nice
delicious
ale
give
it
a
try
anyway
i
enjoyed
the
new
kind
of
taste
that
is
not
normal
in
most
ales
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
december
29
2011
the
pour
is
ambercopper
with
a
shortlasting
head
that
boils
down
to
a
ring
and
a
slightly
cloudy
appearance
for
the
title
the
aroma
is
actually
rather
straight
forward
with
a
nuice
sweet
maltiness
and
a
clean
hoppiness
on
the
nose
the
body
is
medium
compared
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
entirely
unique
with
a
very
spicy
bite
of
pepper
that
pretty
mucn
drowns
out
the
malts
and
hops
unique
for
certain
but
not
really
something
i
would
have
regularly
o
not
too
good
interesting
and
pretty
good
the
heat
from
the
chili
is
not
hot
but
makes
a
presence
nice
earthy
pale
malt
to
back
it
up
d
this
ale
is
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
a
chipotle
ale
aromas
and
flavors
shout
smokey
chipotle
peppers
which
is
unique
and
tasty
however
i
wish
there
was
more
of
a
body
to
go
with
it
jh
ale
brewed
with
chipotle
peppers
o
very
different
and
quite
complex
love
the
flavours
and
the
whole
experience
really
o
as
expected
this
would
pair
great
with
some
food
i
was
expecting
a
lot
hotter
beer
but
this
is
really
chipotle
flavor
with
only
a
tint
of
heat
well
done
o
the
flavor
is
a
little
underwhelming
but
otherwise
pretty
good
for
the
style
try
one
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
spicy
beer
grade
b
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tumbler
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
slightly
hazed
copper
coloring
with
no
head
the
nose
is
caramel
malty
in
the
background
with
a
pepper
spice
and
smokiness
in
the
forefront
flavors
are
heavily
ladened
with
the
peppery
flavors
both
sweet
and
spicy
and
a
heavy
dose
of
roasted
smokiness
very
well
balanced
and
a
good
background
of
malt
sweetness
to
keep
everything
held
together
and
smooth
the
beer
is
midbodied
and
remains
on
the
light
side
for
the
flavor
profile
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
the
smokiness
with
bits
of
the
pepper
vegetable
on
the
palate
midlinger
finish
again
mostly
the
smoke
very
unique
and
interesting
brew
great
flavors
and
not
overpowering
cant
wait
to
have
it
with
some
enchiladas
or
other
mexican
fare
o
i
like
spicy
things
so
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
with
this
beer
but
it
does
let
you
know
its
a
beer
that
has
spices
in
it
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
overall
cool
idea
poor
delivery
this
is
a
weak
watery
excuse
for
a
craft
beer
would
not
buy
again
o
the
idea
of
chiles
in
beer
was
initially
offputting
but
im
glad
i
gave
this
one
a
chance
it
actually
is
very
good
verdict
certainly
an
interesting
beer
that
is
not
for
everyone
if
you
are
looking
for
a
unique
flavor
or
to
see
where
beer
can
go
check
this
one
out
another
really
solid
sampling
from
rogue
who
never
seem
to
let
me
down
o
i
figured
coming
from
rogue
this
one
would
provide
a
little
more
flavor
i
was
disappointed
there
wasnt
much
heat
but
the
smoke
flavor
was
nice
i
will
try
other
chile
beers
but
not
this
one
edit
after
taking
my
last
sips
of
this
beer
at
room
temperature
i
did
catch
a
hint
of
heat
the
ratings
on
beer
advocate
will
overwhelmingly
tell
you
that
chili
peppers
and
beer
are
rarely
on
speaking
terms
rogues
chipotle
ale
however
isnt
too
hard
to
swallow
what
so
ever
its
texmex
meets
the
northwest
and
its
a
surprisingly
decent
combination
especially
when
or
rather
provided
it
is
paired
with
the
right
foods
bravo
and
salud
to
rogue
overall
i
managed
to
drink
the
bottle
but
it
really
isnt
my
sort
of
thing
ill
give
it
points
for
originality
bu
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
well
maybe
for
cooking
as
some
other
have
suggested
overall
then
while
i
do
adore
the
flavors
of
chipotles
in
general
theyre
overlyrepresented
here
and
should
have
been
equal
partners
rather
than
the
dominating
boss
demanding
those
tps
reports
be
delivered
five
minutes
ago
o
i
like
this
and
as
mentioned
before
i
agree
that
this
would
pair
extremely
well
with
barbecued
meats
even
smoked
spicy
meat
definitely
would
like
honey
and
spicy
bbq
ribs
slow
cooked
under
cedar
chips
my
mouth
is
now
drooling
lol
definitely
a
great
experience
as
my
first
chilihot
pepper
beer
keep
up
the
great
work
rogue
poured
a
slightly
hazed
copper
with
a
thin
layer
of
delicate
bubbles
for
a
head
malty
aroma
very
light
with
a
touch
of
smokiness
not
much
in
the
way
of
chipotle
in
the
smell
toasted
malts
on
the
tongue
a
bit
of
smoke
and
just
a
mild
sensation
of
hop
bitterness
i
didnt
really
get
any
chipotle
until
a
few
second
after
swallowing
the
first
swig
but
after
that
the
slight
tingle
was
with
my
for
the
rest
of
the
session
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
pretty
nice
to
drink
if
you
dont
mind
a
little
extra
zing
in
your
beer
drink
45
a
great
brew
very
drinkable
for
spicier
beer
o
my
first
spiced
ale
im
definitely
impressed
the
spice
heat
and
smokiness
are
all
done
very
well
and
arent
overdone
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
very
tasty
and
interesting
beer
this
would
pair
great
with
barbecue
or
anything
meaty
overall
pretty
average
fine
but
not
exciting
since
the
beer
is
assumedly
meant
to
be
focused
on
the
chipotle
i
was
surprised
how
mild
it
is
22oz
bomber
pours
clear
copper
with
a
now
you
see
it
now
you
dont
off
white
head
smell
definitely
hints
at
smoke
and
peppers
smell
deeper
though
and
just
a
strong
caramel
dominates
taste
definitely
is
dominated
by
smoky
peppers
but
not
nearly
as
intrusively
as
i
imagined
it
leaves
a
lingering
slight
sting
around
the
mouth
the
back
of
the
throat
very
balanced
actually
and
it
reminds
me
of
the
rauchbiers
from
bamburg
a
bit
grassy
bready
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
tingly
overall
very
interesting
very
creative
not
my
cup
of
beer
tea
but
very
very
well
done
interesting
i
love
chipotle
i
love
peppers
period
i
love
spicy
heat
do
i
love
this
beer
i
dont
think
so
but
i
am
infatuated
im
drinking
this
ice
cold
and
the
smoky
chipotle
works
nicely
its
a
really
well
balanced
beer
most
rogue
beers
are
really
good
and
this
is
no
exception
so
it
all
hinges
on
the
chipotle
i
think
maybe
i
could
fall
for
this
the
heat
gets
more
noticeable
as
you
drink
it
its
not
overbearing
at
all
and
i
got
to
say
that
this
heat
in
beer
is
an
interesting
concept
it
adds
that
background
flavor
that
just
makes
it
interesting
d
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
real
nice
beer
it
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
with
some
chipotle
peppers
mixed
in
the
flavor
was
nice
i
was
just
hoping
for
a
little
more
head
i
definitely
think
it
is
worth
a
try
though
id
drink
it
again
pours
a
clean
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
smokey
and
spicy
in
the
taste
smokey
and
spicy
and
some
dry
yeastiness
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
spice
and
small
burn
in
the
aftertaste
smokey
and
spicy
great
for
mexican
food
best
appreciated
when
drinking
slowly
with
food
need
time
off
between
sips
on
this
one
but
one
damn
interesting
beer
the
bitterness
is
great
the
chipotle
may
take
some
getting
used
to
pours
copper
with
a
white
head
mild
chili
aroma
with
first
pour
that
gets
greater
as
it
warms
medium
body
like
that
of
a
golden
ale
chipotle
flavor
really
comes
out
as
it
warms
up
with
a
little
heat
at
the
back
of
the
throat
great
body
and
carbonation
for
a
chili
beer
this
beer
was
pretty
enjoyable
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
a
long
time
ago
and
gave
it
a
try
i
had
no
idea
at
the
time
on
what
to
expect
when
drinking
this
the
color
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
creamy
looking
head
on
it
the
aroma
doesnt
really
have
much
of
a
pepper
quality
to
it
instead
its
got
some
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
the
spice
is
in
there
but
its
very
minimal
the
mouthfeel
is
drinkable
and
pretty
smooth
overall
i
was
hoping
the
chipotle
was
going
to
be
a
little
stronger
pretty
decent
beer
though
i
enjoyed
trying
it
nicely
done
but
a
little
onedimensional
malt
chipotle
okay
i
guess
thats
two
dimensions
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
decent
body
and
a
fair
foamy
head
nose
has
a
nicely
balanced
combination
of
malt
earthtone
and
pepper
flavor
follows
suit
pale
malt
earthy
heartiness
and
a
nice
subtle
chile
pepper
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
overall
its
like
a
rauchbier
but
not
nearly
as
aggressive
sweet
and
zesty
to
balance
the
smoke
not
something
im
racing
out
to
get
another
bottle
of
but
not
bad
either
though
i
dont
have
another
chile
beer
to
compare
this
to
i
think
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
interesting
drink
hazy
copperamber
colour
light
white
head
and
no
lace
smell
is
smokey
chile
pepper
campfire
like
bacon
and
a
light
malt
taste
is
smokey
malt
mild
bitterness
nice
heat
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
as
well
as
a
light
hoppy
citrus
note
medium
body
medium
carbonation
nice
overall
weight
good
feel
this
was
better
than
i
thought
would
be
nice
with
bbq
or
chile
but
worked
well
on
a
warm
sunday
afternoon
i
frankly
didnt
know
that
chille
beer
was
a
style
thought
itd
be
under
herbedspiced
and
have
never
had
one
before
so
ill
give
it
a
pass
but
the
smell
is
just
too
much
for
me
to
consider
drinking
more
than
the
two
i
bought
already
not
bad
probably
not
something
id
have
too
often
but
i
agree
with
a
previous
reviewer
that
this
might
be
a
great
cooking
brew
while
it
mercifully
didnt
taste
like
someone
dumped
pepper
juice
into
a
beer
tun
the
pepper
flavor
is
only
mild
i
had
expected
a
bit
more
zing
to
it
still
an
fine
effort
red
hued
amber
in
colour
creamy
eggshell
coloured
foam
retains
moderately
well
and
leaves
a
spotty
lace
muted
aromas
of
toast
and
smoke
tastes
toasty
with
chipotle
smokiness
slight
tang
mild
bitterness
barely
even
a
tingle
of
warmth
from
the
peppers
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
feels
smooth
im
quite
disappointed
they
played
it
safe
with
the
chipotle
there
is
only
a
little
smoke
and
almost
no
spice
to
be
found
in
this
beer
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
fails
to
meet
expectations
a
beer
called
chipotle
ale
should
taste
like
chipotles
pour
was
a
cloudy
orange
good
head
with
plenty
of
lacing
nose
was
spicy
and
peppers
taste
was
pretty
smooth
not
overly
done
on
the
chipotle
but
enough
to
dominate
the
palate
spicyness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
overall
a
rather
impressive
chipotle
ale
and
exceeded
expectations
pours
a
nice
abmber
colour
with
a
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
aromas
fairly
weak
some
sweet
caramel
malt
and
some
peppery
spice
hinting
at
the
chipotle
and
grilled
meat
thats
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
a
campfire
smokiness
comes
out
later
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
buttery
malt
and
bbq
like
smokiness
not
picking
up
much
heat
at
all
except
for
an
underlying
peppery
spice
average
body
and
carbonation
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
disappointing
this
has
been
my
first
foray
into
this
fringe
style
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
heat
however
while
an
entire
bomber
may
be
a
bit
much
for
one
sitting
i
may
pick
up
another
for
cooking
purposes
o
not
bad
but
really
not
that
good
didnt
get
much
heat
from
the
peppers
after
drinking
half
the
bottle
i
was
ready
to
stop
drinking
it
two
fingers
of
bubbly
nitro
head
body
is
copper
nothing
much
by
way
of
aroma
which
makes
me
sad
seriously
there
is
nothing
discernible
here
flavors
are
watery
and
reminiscent
of
plastic
what
follows
is
heavy
biscuit
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
flat
and
thin
and
bitter
residuals
are
left
behind
but
nothing
with
great
flavor
what
the
hell
happened
here
wheres
the
smokiness
where
are
my
chipotle
flavors
this
is
not
what
the
doctor
ordered
ill
be
sure
to
try
it
again
in
a
bottle
and
fix
up
my
review
if
i
need
to
a
very
interesting
break
from
the
norm
the
smokiness
that
the
chiles
add
to
this
ale
makes
it
highly
worthwhile
not
overpowering
in
any
way
the
bite
compliments
what
seems
to
be
an
already
very
drinkable
brew
deep
honey
coloration
with
just
a
bit
of
head
it
came
as
part
of
a
flight
and
the
headlacing
may
have
lessened
before
it
arrived
at
my
table
smoky
smell
with
just
that
subtle
hint
of
jalapeno
consistent
taste
went
extremely
well
with
the
bbq
i
was
having
and
was
a
extremely
nice
warm
up
to
the
ris
that
followed
id
buy
this
one
again
without
a
second
thought
this
is
better
than
other
chili
beers
the
fact
that
they
are
using
roasted
jalapeños
rather
than
raw
makes
a
big
difference
the
pepper
is
subtle
and
does
not
overwhelm
the
decent
ale
that
it
is
layered
into
there
are
only
smoky
overtones
noticed
at
first
as
the
temperature
of
the
beer
rises
the
pepper
is
more
noticeable
while
the
look
of
this
beer
leaves
much
to
be
desired
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
the
smell
is
quite
lacking
and
the
flavor
while
decent
could
definitely
use
more
of
a
bite
while
this
is
probably
not
a
beer
i
would
be
clamoring
to
purchase
again
i
can
understand
why
some
would
seek
it
out
the
mouthfeel
is
great
its
the
perfect
thickness
to
let
the
chilis
make
themselves
known
without
being
too
thick
for
the
fairly
easiygoing
intro
the
only
thing
i
can
knock
this
on
is
the
drinkability
it
drinks
quite
easily
at
first
but
the
last
eight
or
so
ounces
do
begin
to
drag
12oz
bottles
would
be
perfect
here
either
way
itd
be
a
one
and
done
though
a
surprisingly
good
and
unique
ale
here
i
really
enjoyed
give
it
a
try
overall
this
beer
is
awesome
i
had
never
tried
a
chile
beer
before
and
i
was
really
satisfied
with
it
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
and
i
was
impressed
definitely
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
cinco
de
mayo
this
beer
pours
a
very
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
smell
is
of
moderate
pepper
its
not
as
much
as
id
hoped
for
it
has
light
smokiness
and
has
a
malt
aroma
similar
to
that
of
malt
liquor
strange
luckily
the
pepper
heat
becomes
more
prominent
as
it
warms
the
flavor
is
very
smokey
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
pepper
but
i
do
get
a
light
spice
to
it
it
reminds
me
of
the
shiner
smokhaus
for
some
reason
its
very
malty
and
there
are
no
hops
to
be
found
its
just
malt
and
spice
some
sweetness
arises
on
the
back
end
of
the
beer
it
drinks
light
and
is
drinkable
enough
this
style
is
an
acquired
taste
im
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
beer
isnt
special
enough
to
warrant
your
6
overall
i
like
this
beer
as
a
very
drinkable
one
22oz
bottle
pours
a
murky
amberish
brown
color
with
a
very
small
layer
of
head
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
peppery
and
smokey
jalapenos
and
malts
smells
spicy
flavor
is
spicy
as
well
tastes
peppery
but
is
a
bit
watery
smokey
flavor
along
with
spicy
chiles
smokey
aftertaste
i
would
love
to
pair
this
beer
with
some
mexican
food
next
time
this
beer
is
a
lot
like
a
rauchbier
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
enjoy
this
style
worth
buying
again
pours
a
nice
hazy
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
disappears
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
smell
is
that
of
malt
liquor
at
first
i
picked
up
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
then
suddenly
i
got
a
little
smokey
flavor
with
very
little
pepper
sadly
it
disappears
as
fast
as
it
shows
up
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
crisp
up
front
then
turns
slightly
creamy
with
a
dry
finish
overall
i
wish
this
beer
had
more
heat
to
it
luckily
it
was
well
matched
with
bbq
chicken
i
will
definatly
try
this
in
the
future
overall
very
interesting
take
on
a
smokey
brew
super
drinkable
but
beware
i
had
immense
heart
burn
after
ingesting
this
brew
ouch
not
worth
it
really
had
this
on
tap
at
the
thirsty
monk
poured
a
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
nose
is
very
peppery
with
some
malt
and
promises
the
chipotle
that
is
expected
small
amount
of
malt
in
the
taste
with
a
well
balanced
chipotle
flavor
not
too
much
not
too
little
if
you
like
whats
promised
by
this
beer
it
delivers
nicely
still
not
the
most
interesting
of
brews
in
comparison
to
the
only
other
chile
beer
ive
had
theobroma
this
misses
a
lot
of
points
the
peppers
are
done
correctly
not
overbearing
but
present
although
other
than
that
there
is
nothing
else
going
on
with
this
beer
will
not
seek
out
again
but
worth
trying
for
the
curiosity
of
it
o
its
a
pretty
good
chile
beer
could
use
a
little
more
chipotle
flavour
this
is
probably
a
good
introduction
beer
to
this
style
dn
delicious
bbq
in
a
bottle
wonderful
brew
and
highly
drinkable
if
you
love
natural
and
light
pepper
flavor
i
wish
this
was
distributed
to
my
area
i
like
offcentered
beers
and
enjoyed
this
one
do
pretty
enjoyable
beer
the
smokiness
and
pepper
make
it
worthwhile
do
easily
drinkable
and
not
overbearingly
spicy
a
great
example
of
a
smoky
chile
beer
highly
carbonated
yet
smooth
clear
orange
with
a
small
circle
of
white
head
smells
kind
of
bready
and
sweet
and
then
a
spicy
peppery
note
hits
tastes
sweet
like
a
bready
amber
ale
a
light
smokiness
is
present
and
some
pepper
flavor
comes
through
as
well
not
too
hot
but
it
is
certainly
present
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
decently
drinkable
i
could
see
someone
really
liking
this
one
if
they
were
a
fan
of
chipotle
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
i
see
real
potential
for
this
beer
in
a
recipe
of
some
sort
a
nice
sweetness
is
present
and
the
pepper
could
definitely
add
some
spice
i
might
pick
this
one
up
to
make
chili
with
decent
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
d
very
wellmade
but
far
too
idiosyncratic
to
be
particularly
drinkable
deliciously
spicy
if
you
dont
like
chipotle
peppers
stay
away
if
you
do
get
some
pours
a
reddish
medium
brown
with
lighttan
head
about
2
fingers
tall
you
can
smell
that
smoked
and
chipotle
aromas
and
you
can
certainly
taste
them
too
i
love
the
smoke
flavor
this
beer
has
it
really
tastes
like
the
smoked
chipotle
ground
spice
i
have
in
the
cabinet
and
in
a
very
good
way
it
would
certainly
make
a
great
stout
too
overall
done
very
nice
as
the
chili
is
reserved
for
the
finish
where
it
should
be
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
have
to
say
the
beers
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
it
smells
malty
and
piny
it
tastes
like
a
good
beer
with
the
malts
coming
through
and
subtle
hops
the
chipotles
hit
you
at
the
end
of
the
beer
after
you
swallow
i
slight
spice
builds
into
a
nice
heat
with
every
gulp
this
beer
is
a
must
if
you
want
to
try
something
new
and
different
i
really
enjoyed
it
m
lighter
bodied
beer
with
medium
carbonation
overall
great
beer
and
a
different
taste
this
beer
exceeded
what
i
thought
a
chipotle
beer
would
be
like
d
drinkable
but
definitely
not
a
session
beer
a
nicer
opener
to
stronger
beers
or
as
many
others
have
said
with
a
meal
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
i
did
enjoy
it
drinkability
i
definitely
feel
like
drinking
more
and
this
is
pretty
good
as
the
spice
keeps
in
line
drinks
easy
a
nice
use
of
hot
pepper
really
profiles
it
nicely
and
is
a
solid
beer
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
very
drinkable
provided
that
you
have
food
it
would
go
very
well
with
a
meal
but
to
drink
a
whole
22oz
bottle
in
one
sitting
by
yourself
would
be
a
little
bit
rough
all
in
all
quite
good
this
here
is
a
good
sessionable
brew
would
purchase
again
finish
has
smoke
which
seems
to
pervade
the
beer
from
start
to
finish
just
not
my
thing
o
the
flavors
are
somewhat
disconnected
in
that
you
taste
them
in
fairly
distinct
separate
tiers
overall
though
its
a
well
balanced
beer
with
a
fun
kick
thats
worth
seeking
out
overall
drinkablity
takes
a
hit
as
the
beer
warms
better
served
ice
cold
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
two
to
three
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
and
chipotle
along
with
some
spiciness
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
the
taste
starts
out
new
with
a
caramel
malt
backbone
and
in
the
middle
the
chipotle
taste
and
heat
hit
you
its
odd
a
first
but
it
is
pretty
pleasurable
spices
round
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
carbonated
and
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
kick
overall
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
more
of
a
novelty
its
an
easy
drink
that
is
a
little
flat
but
the
uniqueness
wont
keep
you
drinking
it
d
i
personally
love
the
spiciness
quite
savory
as
it
goes
down
this
is
by
no
means
a
bash
to
rogue
brewing
because
they
put
out
some
stuff
i
truly
enjoy
i
e
santas
private
reserve
dead
guy
and
xs
would
refrain
from
ever
wasting
your
money
on
this
the
bottle
is
cool
but
the
beer
is
an
atrocity
d
very
good
and
drinkable
i
love
the
spiceiness
and
smell
this
is
probably
the
only
beer
with
a
fruit
added
that
i
really
liked
d
my
first
experience
with
the
chipotle
ale
and
it
was
one
to
remember
the
flavours
are
very
unique
and
i
was
surprised
how
much
it
reminded
me
of
a
rye
beer
the
peppers
definitely
add
a
unique
kick
and
i
would
highly
recommend
that
everyone
takes
this
one
for
a
ride
d
great
beer
low
enough
abv
that
you
can
have
several
great
companion
to
a
gourmet
southwestern
meal
and
desert
drinkability
ive
got
a
soft
spot
for
chile
beers
but
im
a
big
chipotle
fan
this
was
okay
but
i
would
have
liked
more
spiciness
other
than
that
solid
o
my
first
chile
beer
and
possibly
my
last
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
late
smoke
flavor
the
chili
flavor
is
matched
well
against
the
malt
profile
its
pretty
good
its
not
overly
smoky
not
overly
spiced
this
is
probably
my
favorite
actual
chile
beer
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
by
a
long
shot
but
its
worth
a
look
for
sure
d
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
believe
this
would
make
a
nice
pairing
with
fajitas
and
guacamole
or
other
foods
of
that
ilk
d
very
interesting
beer
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
but
better
than
i
expected
especially
seeing
as
how
this
beer
could
be
pretty
hit
or
miss
its
a
hit
in
my
book
and
should
be
tried
if
youre
a
fan
of
spicy
foods
not
my
favorite
beer
by
rogue
but
i
have
to
say
one
of
the
most
creative
beers
i
have
ever
had
when
they
say
chipotle
they
mean
it
i
am
not
sure
if
i
should
drink
this
beer
or
use
it
as
a
seasoning
it
is
very
unique
very
spicy
tastes
like
a
chipotle
salsa
but
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
is
not
over
done
i
can
see
how
this
could
have
gone
wrong
is
so
many
ways
but
hats
off
to
rogue
i
think
they
nailed
what
they
were
going
for
not
sure
i
would
eat
with
spicy
food
might
be
over
kill
tasted
from
22oz
bottle
purchased
at
lush
west
town
pours
light
amber
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
really
leave
any
lace
the
nose
is
smoky
and
reminds
me
more
of
dried
chipotle
rather
than
fresh
smoked
peppers
there
really
isnt
much
else
going
on
as
the
smokiness
takes
over
the
palate
is
a
little
more
exciting
starting
off
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
hops
and
then
moving
to
the
smoky
and
spicy
chipotle
the
body
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
and
a
long
smoky
and
spicy
finish
chipotle
ale
was
maybe
the
third
or
fourth
beer
ive
had
from
rogues
regular
lineup
im
not
sure
if
it
was
this
beer
or
brown
nectar
that
sold
me
on
rogue
as
a
top
notch
brewery
but
either
way
this
is
a
beer
to
try
especially
if
youre
one
of
the
many
who
have
never
had
a
chile
beer
before
chipotle
ale
is
just
that
its
a
slightly
malty
beer
with
a
smokey
taste
and
a
chipotle
pepper
kick
to
the
finish
not
hot
in
the
food
sense
but
there
is
a
notable
kick
after
swallowing
this
beer
that
provides
for
a
very
fresh
and
less
than
common
experience
chipotle
ale
is
not
as
complex
and
subtle
as
the
chile
beers
ive
tried
since
best
served
by
itself
and
an
excellent
choice
for
a
first
time
chilebeer
consumer
dthe
taste
stays
pretty
well
the
main
problem
is
that
you
better
have
some
pulled
pork
near
by
or
else
youre
gonna
be
tortured
throughout
this
beer
i
generally
like
a
higher
abv
but
considering
the
bottle
size
im
glad
this
beer
wasnt
too
much
stronger
not
so
much
if
youre
accustomed
to
drinking
something
to
numb
the
burn
of
hot
pepper
this
beer
will
throw
you
for
a
loop
pair
it
with
some
food
thats
not
very
spicy
to
balance
things
out
drinkable
is
not
a
word
id
use
with
this
beer
if
you
like
spiciness
get
a
burrito
or
snack
on
a
jalapeno
i
dont
get
why
it
should
taste
good
in
a
beer
that
said
rogue
seems
to
have
done
a
good
job
on
this
one
if
i
were
inclined
to
have
another
spicy
beer
id
have
this
one
again
the
smokey
spice
of
the
chipotle
hits
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
with
a
slight
lingering
cinnamon
fire
candy
sweetness
up
front
this
is
real
big
on
flavor
but
all
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
meld
as
well
as
it
could
a
very
interesting
beer
to
try
and
worth
the
experience
but
not
one
im
going
back
for
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
chili
beers
ive
had
its
pretty
moderate
in
heat
but
i
really
like
the
flavors
of
the
chipotle
and
smokiness
its
still
pretty
onesided
in
that
its
all
about
the
pepper
i
love
peppers
i
love
beer
so
why
not
try
them
together
my
experience
with
spiced
or
pepper
beers
has
largely
been
limited
to
the
famous
or
infamous
cave
creek
chili
beer
ive
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
that
beer
though
its
admittedly
gross
now
that
ive
moved
on
to
bigger
and
badder
beers
pours
a
red
bordering
on
copper
nice
balooning
head
with
some
pretty
impressive
amount
of
lacing
moderate
carbonation
levels
aroma
is
all
smokey
chipotle
pepper
and
not
much
else
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
the
chipotle
favor
itll
be
pretty
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
flavor
is
smoked
chili
powder
mixed
into
a
red
ale
medium
caramel
sweetness
in
the
finish
with
some
temperate
pepper
this
beer
would
go
great
with
barbecue
like
burnt
ends
or
spare
ribs
standing
alone
its
merely
an
interesting
execution
on
the
pepper
beer
style
heads
and
shoulders
above
cave
creek
but
lacking
something
pair
something
with
it
i
pulled
out
some
local
smoked
pepper
jack
cheese
and
it
really
shines
i
poured
this
beer
from
a
22oz
bottle
it
had
a
2
finger
foamy
fizzy
head
on
top
of
a
nice
brown
amber
color
body
the
aroma
is
very
nice
of
chili
peppers
and
carmel
notes
the
taste
is
nice
and
smokey
nice
malty
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
beer
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
d
i
love
beer
and
chipotle
and
this
combination
is
fantastic
the
flavours
are
exactly
what
i
want
the
feel
is
a
great
balance
of
smooth
richness
and
tingly
heat
very
drinkable
although
the
heat
may
really
start
to
build
after
a
few
overall
a
fantastic
idea
with
a
better
result
d
overall
the
beer
drank
very
well
and
was
not
at
all
overwhelming
on
the
spice
like
other
chile
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
where
it
burns
going
down
the
hatch
i
think
i
have
to
pick
up
more
fresh
bottles
cause
it
seems
like
the
spice
dies
through
time
imo
drinkablity
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
pretty
refreshing
and
interesting
and
novel
beer
for
sure
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
if
you
like
a
bit
of
spiciness
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
drinkability
really
depends
on
whether
you
liked
the
smokiness
in
your
beer
or
not
i
thought
i
did
as
i
love
chipotle
flavor
but
for
some
reasons
i
was
not
much
of
fan
cloudy
reddish
gold
brew
gives
a
thick
tan
head
that
leaves
a
thick
carpet
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
really
interesting
fairly
typical
thick
semisweet
bready
malts
but
then
an
unmistakable
spicy
red
pepper
bite
the
taste
is
very
much
the
same
though
adds
a
bit
of
smokiness
presumably
also
from
the
chipotle
mouthfeel
is
moderately
thick
with
appropriate
carbonation
the
spice
is
felt
mildly
starting
with
the
first
sip
but
really
develops
and
lingers
long
into
the
finish
a
pleasant
warming
burn
very
interesting
not
something
id
drink
regularly
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
have
it
again
on
occasion
nice
a
cold
bottle
of
heat
recommended
d
a
really
fun
brew
to
try
and
worth
picking
up
even
if
its
only
once
id
definitely
drink
it
again
though
especially
with
mildtomoderately
spicy
food
or
a
steaky
fish
tuna
sword
etc
rouges
chipotle
ale
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
good
size
head
that
went
away
rather
quickly
it
had
a
smell
of
cooked
peppers
and
i
found
it
just
offensive
the
taste
was
heavy
full
and
had
a
spicey
note
to
it
it
was
rather
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
and
a
very
good
beer
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
it
a
must
try
d
the
first
taste
through
me
off
i
was
not
expecting
a
refreshing
taste
and
was
hoping
for
something
more
spicy
although
this
was
mild
by
the
time
i
finished
this
bomber
my
tongue
had
just
a
bit
of
burning
over
all
i
hope
to
buy
this
beer
again
soon
this
beer
is
quite
interesting
pours
deep
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
great
lacing
smells
of
fresh
fruit
light
malt
and
spiciness
tastes
of
cooked
fruit
slightly
roasted
malt
and
roasted
peppers
the
spiciness
isnt
overbearing
but
does
increase
the
more
you
drink
leaves
a
nice
warm
feeling
in
your
mouth
and
throat
quite
an
experience
d
this
is
one
to
be
paired
with
food
and
kept
in
moderation
do
enjoy
it
though
arrives
a
deep
copper
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
very
malty
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
first
sip
is
wow
what
a
nice
unexpected
smokiness
to
this
brew
very
much
like
a
rauchbier
a
very
pleasant
suprise
there
is
no
pepper
hotness
to
this
at
all
like
i
was
expecting
i
would
certainly
get
this
interesting
brew
again
drinkability
decent
beer
could
have
used
more
heat
ots
a
chili
beer
looks
like
a
pale
ale
smells
like
a
pale
ale
and
but
for
the
slightest
hint
of
chile
tastes
like
one
too
its
a
good
beer
but
not
at
all
what
i
was
hoping
for
drinkability
given
the
style
ill
pass
on
it
while
i
enjoyed
it
its
not
what
i
would
have
expected
from
a
beer
whose
style
is
focused
on
the
chile

i
was
expecting
more
this
is
super
spicy
so
much
so
that
it
is
making
my
acid
reflux
act
up
i
would
like
it
more
if
the
spiciness
could
be
minimized
a
bit
but
i
guess
thats
why
it
is
called
chipotle
ale
split
a
bomber
and
not
looking
for
any
more
ever
actually
this
was
nice
thing
to
sample
but
im
not
gonna
go
back
for
more
md
middle
of
the
road
mouthfeel
i
was
able
to
finish
my
half
of
the
bomber
no
problem
but
my
tasting
partner
didnt
do
much
damage
and
ive
never
seen
him
not
finish
a
beer
before
d
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
my
boyfriend
loved
it
ill
go
back
to
my
ipas
and
let
him
have
the
spice
d
not
for
me
fun
to
try
but
for
me
probably
better
to
use
for
cooking
average
to
below
average
a
tasty
beer
but
somehow
something
is
still
missing
i
actually
think
that
the
pacman
yeast
is
doing
something
here
that
i
dont
like
too
much
still
one
of
the
better
chilli
beers
ive
had
drinkability
average
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
but
im
sure
it
goes
great
with
authentic
mexican
food
this
was
good
but
i
wasnt
wowed
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
the
aromas
on
the
nose
were
very
faint
although
you
do
pick
up
slight
notes
of
hops
smoke
and
peppers
the
chipolte
comes
through
subtely
just
adding
a
littel
smokiness
that
is
balanced
with
hops
and
malts
overall
good
but
not
great
great
brew
for
the
spring
goes
very
well
will
salsa
or
any
mexican
dish
for
that
matter
complex
flavoring
tends
to
get
bolder
the
warmer
it
is
as
expected
not
alot
of
head
about
14
an
inch
depending
on
your
pour
i
would
recomend
this
beer
to
everyone
a
great
treat
d
nothing
really
stood
about
this
beer
although
i
might
try
it
again
just
because
this
is
a
unique
style
i
think
this
beer
would
work
better
paired
with
food
than
drinking
it
by
itself
d
pretty
interesting
brew
that
incorporates
earthy
herbal
hops
with
a
spicy
peppery
flair
this
would
pair
quite
well
with
mexican
food
the
oily
peppery
character
really
retained
its
spiciness
considering
the
age
of
this
bottle
purchased
november
2008
a
gimmick
i
suppose
but
actually
quite
delicious
a
nice
ale
taste
underneath
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
the
chili
taste
is
in
fact
really
really
good
and
goes
well
with
the
beer
there
is
a
nice
bite
from
the
pepper
but
nothing
excessive
drinkability
while
im
enjoying
this
beer
and
one
sip
leads
easily
to
another
it
is
really
pretty
much
a
one
a
night
beer
because
of
the
lingering
heat
in
the
after
taste
while
i
like
my
chili
with
lots
of
chiles
there
are
also
other
flavors
to
break
up
the
heat
this
beer
fills
a
nice
niche
but
is
more
for
pairing
with
food
than
for
an
evenings
drinking
notes
rouge
taking
the
brewing
to
another
limit
and
the
result
is
this
bright
and
tasty
chipotle
beer
really
good
perhaps
the
best
pepper
beer
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
taste
is
of
chipolte
corn
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
end
has
a
strange
aftertaste
to
it
well
with
all
that
being
said
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
and
also
glad
i
have
another
one
in
the
fridge
i
almost
feel
like
attempting
this
as
a
homebrew
to
give
as
gifts
thanks
rogue
well
played
d
in
comparison
to
other
unusual
or
oddly
spicedherbal
brews
fraoch
heather
to
name
one
this
is
slightly
easier
to
drink
because
the
main
flavor
component
is
not
overwhelming
and
doesnt
manhandle
the
palate
so
to
speak
not
a
session
brew
more
like
a
beer
to
drink
with
a
mild
mexican
dish
or
any
other
mildly
spiced
food
not
exactly
something
youd
reach
for
if
you
were
eating
hot
wings
or
something
although
the
flavors
would
probably
meld
pretty
well
could
leave
some
gasping
for
air
andor
water
d
underachieving
but
interesting
if
the
flavor
were
kicked
up
a
notch
or
two
id
be
way
more
into
it
d
enjoyable
for
one
or
two
at
a
bbq
or
something
would
not
recommend
more
than
that
simply
not
interesting
enough
d
id
say
this
is
very
drinkable
id
imagine
it
would
go
awesome
with
some
mexican
food
im
drinking
it
solo
though
and
im
enjoying
it
a
good
bit
the
beer
doesnt
beat
you
over
the
head
with
the
heat
and
your
mouth
wont
catch
on
fire
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
i
dont
think
would
be
well
suited
to
session
drinking
i
look
forward
to
experimenting
with
various
food
pairings
but
sitting
down
at
the
pub
and
having
three
or
four
in
a
row
doesnt
really
sound
ideal
d
goes
down
pretty
easily
but
the
lacking
aftertaste
slows
it
down
d
the
drinkability
here
isnt
great
i
was
sooo
looking
forward
to
trying
this
i
went
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
a
bottle
and
saved
it
for
a
special
pairing
with
my
homemade
chili
which
has
beer
and
chipotle
peppers
in
it
this
should
have
been
a
wonderful
pairing
but
unfortunately
i
ended
up
drainpouring
this
bad
boy
d
normally
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
rogue
has
found
a
way
to
make
a
chile
beer
thats
actually
quite
good
its
definitely
more
of
a
food
beer
as
it
would
accompany
ribs
nicely
final
thoughts
i
would
want
a
stronger
attack
on
the
nose
some
heat
and
a
more
fuller
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
though
only
perhaps
under
the
right
circumstances
i
once
had
this
beer
after
a
nice
spicey
dish
of
chicken
with
a
chipotle
sauce
i
thought
this
would
be
a
perfect
pairing
howeverafter
the
meal
the
spicey
aspect
of
this
beer
was
almost
completely
unnoticeable
rendering
it
quite
bland
and
thus
driving
the
drinkability
way
down
when
consumed
before
a
meal
andor
on
a
clean
palate
however
this
beer
is
quite
vibrant
and
very
drinkable
and
so
two
hours
after
a
very
unspicey
meal
this
one
did
not
disappoint
at
all
d
i
cracked
it
open
with
a
grilled
pork
chop
and
let
me
say
i
had
a
dance
in
my
mouth
this
one
was
incredible
with
my
food
it
is
a
five
all
the
way
but
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
one
on
its
own
after
my
food
was
gone
and
since
this
is
a
beer
rating
it
is
going
to
be
lower
my
advice
is
enjoy
this
with
a
meal
its
awesome
overall
not
a
beer
i
will
grab
again
i
have
wanted
to
try
it
for
awhile
now
and
im
glad
i
did
but
beyond
that
it
does
not
inspire
me
let
me
also
say
im
a
huge
pepper
and
hot
spicy
stuff
fan
and
this
beer
didnt
really
live
up
the
the
chili
side
of
things
since
this
beer
is
spicier
than
it
is
smokey
it
would
pair
well
with
mexican
or
spicier
foods
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
spicey
red
chile
edge
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
very
spicey
chipotle
pepper
taste
i
love
these
kind
of
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
rogue
seems
to
be
able
to
get
it
done
no
matter
what
style
it
is
d
i
may
have
to
track
this
down
again
and
do
the
drink
with
mexican
food
advice
it
kind
of
ruins
the
night
for
drinking
since
the
burn
kind
of
sticks
with
you
for
at
least
and
hour
or
two
so
in
a
way
it
is
spicy
this
is
a
unique
brew
i
enjoyed
the
the
smoky
spicy
finish
it
provided
a
unique
balance
to
the
sweetish
malt
up
front
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
it
is
very
hot
and
i
think
it
could
go
well
with
a
taco
i
am
glad
i
am
splitting
this
3
ways
as
it
is
hard
to
drink
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
well
enough
to
finish
it
and
while
i
appreciate
the
craft
that
went
into
it
i
dont
know
that
ill
be
getting
it
again
perhaps
it
would
go
well
with
a
meal
this
is
simply
one
difficult
beer
for
me
to
rate
not
too
drinkable
worth
trying
though
drinkability
great
for
the
spice
kick
and
smokiness
a
definite
winner
with
certain
cuisines
and
just
for
a
spice
fix
it
just
needs
a
more
assertive
malt
profile
and
a
fuller
body
to
be
a
true
winner
pours
a
clear
copper
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
pepper
and
slight
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
chili
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
an
obvious
heat
is
present
tastes
of
pepper
yeast
and
slight
pale
malt
overall
the
chili
domniates
and
the
flavor
is
good
at
first
but
the
heat
builds
and
makes
it
hard
to
drink
d
an
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
for
the
style
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
yet
it
seems
to
be
missing
something
maybe
more
heat
maybe
heavier
mouthfeel
just
something
more
nonetheless
this
is
a
unique
brew
that
is
worth
a
shot
theobroma
being
my
only
reference
for
chili
beers
this
is
much
better
md
carbonation
is
pretty
low
and
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
i
liked
the
taste
at
first
but
by
the
end
the
smokiness
wore
out
its
welcome
and
i
was
ready
to
switch
i
think
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
potential
when
paired
well
with
food
but
its
a
bit
much
on
its
own
rusty
amber
in
color
smells
like
an
average
beer
very
smooth
subtle
hints
of
pepper
not
very
hot
but
you
can
taste
the
spice
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
spicey
but
this
is
definitely
an
above
average
beer
would
love
to
eat
a
burrito
with
this
one
one
last
thing
do
not
drink
this
beer
if
you
have
chapped
lips
cold
sores
or
any
raw
spots
in
your
mouth
thats
when
the
peppers
will
get
you
d
not
my
kind
of
beer
many
like
this
beer
but
for
me
not
one
i
enjoy
overall
an
interesting
ale
the
light
smokiness
was
pleasantly
surprising
interesting
effort
extreme
beer
though
i
tend
to
define
extreme
as
something
innovative
and
delicious
so
i
would
say
rogue
is
a
bit
off
of
the
mark
here
poured
in
to
a
weisse
glass
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
head
and
ok
lacing
not
sure
where
to
start
the
taste
end
of
this
review
this
was
a
well
made
ale
but
i
got
only
minor
tingling
on
my
tongue
from
drinking
it
i
really
wanted
to
feel
the
fire
of
the
chipotle
but
for
me
there
was
none
however
the
friend
i
split
this
with
could
barely
finish
his
share
due
to
the
heat
so
i
am
at
a
lost
how
i
feel
about
this
brew
it
was
well
made
its
not
perfect
but
a
bit
above
average
b
it
is
lacking
in
mouthfeel
but
just
a
bit
the
peppers
are
too
dominant
d
so
unique
taxing
on
its
own
but
went
great
with
my
dinner
of
keilbasa
casserole
an
interesting
blend
of
chili
flavour
scotchlike
peat
and
well
balanced
amber
ale
not
a
particularly
sessionable
offering
to
be
truthful
what
with
there
being
all
that
oftmentioned
smoke
rather
than
spice
from
the
guest
ingredient
d
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
very
much
of
this
as
it
just
doesnt
come
across
as
something
id
want
to
drink
more
than
a
bomber
of
really
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
pair
with
food
though
excellent
work
rogue
a
beer
that
i
cant
believe
ive
passed
by
a
million
times
compared
to
most
other
chile
beers
this
is
fantastic
as
most
of
them
end
up
tasting
like
crackers
with
tabasco
sauce
on
them
cheers
drinkability
not
too
great
for
this
one
to
be
fair
i
was
a
little
tired
of
the
spicy
taste
already
but
i
dont
think
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
regardless
its
not
a
bad
beerin
fact
its
a
pretty
interesting
onebut
its
more
of
a
novelty
than
anything
i
think
id
actively
seek
out
again
i
just
feel
like
somethings
missing
drinkability
a
beer
that
i
would
be
able
to
drink
again
however
i
would
not
actively
seek
it
out
at
a
bar
or
beer
store
d
only
fair
for
me
the
odd
flatness
and
rauchbier
qualities
do
not
jive
well
with
the
pepper
aftertaste
i
will
finish
the
22
ounces
but
will
most
likely
not
seek
this
one
out
again

i
wasnt
expecting
to
make
this
beer
something
id
drink
on
the
regular
but
i
was
hoping
for
maybe
a
fungimmick
type
of
brew
that
would
be
fun
to
buy
every
once
and
awhile
to
pair
with
appropriate
cuisines
i
think
the
smokey
flavors
dont
really
blend
well
with
the
malt
and
hops
of
an
ale
and
are
better
suited
for
a
porter
or
stout
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
i
drank
it
all
and
enjoyed
it
for
the
most
part
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
again
upon
trying
this
i
am
no
longer
quite
so
intrigued
reminds
me
of
the
time
i
added
chipotle
and
habanero
to
some
vodka
interesting
idea
but
not
much
i
could
drink
it
with
it
tastes
like
a
thin
beer
without
much
carbonation
that
is
smoky
clearly
there
are
chipotles
in
the
beer
but
the
beer
offers
nothing
beyond
it
maybe
i
am
wrong
in
reviewing
it
in
comparison
by
other
beers
but
i
find
it
to
be
having
no
great
beeryness
to
it
i
dont
read
reviews
first
and
had
decided
on
what
i
would
do
and
then
saw
the
bros
highly
reviewed
it
that
will
be
my
next
stop
to
see
why
they
liked
this
to
me
highly
mediocre
beer
d
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
to
this
brew
while
the
chipotle
was
nice
it
demanded
something
more
something
to
complement
it
most
of
the
flavor
was
smoke
but
not
to
the
same
caliber
as
their
smoke
ale
otherwise
this
is
a
deliciously
unique
brew
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
interesting
to
pair
with
tacos
i
did
or
mexican
food
this
might
be
the
beer
for
it
not
necessarily
something
i
will
go
to
in
the
future
but
worth
a
try
im
drinking
this
with
taco
bell
right
now
and
they
go
great
together
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
fat
tire
with
chipotle
flavor
added
but
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
willing
to
try
anything
new
especially
if
they
like
southwestern
cuisine
i
may
pair
this
with
some
mexican
food
very
soon
to
get
another
perspective
on
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
new
favorite
of
mine
it
is
the
best
chile
beer
i
have
had
overall
the
peppers
hit
a
completely
different
region
of
the
senses
than
the
beer
itself
which
is
unfortunate
as
i
wanted
them
to
blend
more
amicably
the
way
coffee
flavors
sneak
into
a
beer
this
and
the
overly
cloying
sweet
taste
of
the
beer
are
its
only
faults
d
nice
integration
of
peppers
here
there
are
no
offputting
flavors
or
funkiness
certainly
the
best
chile
beer
ive
yet
tried
i
kind
of
wanted
rogue
to
blow
the
chile
beer
out
of
the
water
with
this
but
it
just
seems
kind
of
savoury
without
being
particularly
pungent
spicy
or
full
of
character
ultimately
seems
a
bit
tame
and
a
sort
of
muddle
between
chilli
and
smoked
beer
flavours
not
undrinkable
but
a
bit
blah
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
it
looks
good
with
a
bright
copper
body
topped
with
a
rocky
soft
head
the
nose
is
somewhat
promising
with
a
bit
of
honey
sweet
caramel
and
light
hotness
hinting
at
the
peppers
however
on
the
palate
it
tastes
a
lttle
bit
like
a
prank
beer
the
kind
of
vibe
where
you
think
this
probably
would
have
been
pretty
good
if
it
didnt
have
the
chilli
especially
by
the
end
of
a
650ml
bottle
i
was
well
over
it
its
a
well
made
beer
with
decent
balance
weight
carbonation
and
bitterness
some
cool
smokiness
and
i
guess
its
appropriate
to
the
style
of
chilli
beer
but
i
dont
really
care
if
i
never
drink
it
again
d
this
beer
was
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
which
goes
to
show
you
dont
be
shy
about
trying
new
things
but
being
in
no
we
love
our
spices
so
should
have
figured
that
a
chile
ale
from
rogues
would
be
good
drinkability
you
cant
chug
this
stuff
at
all
just
enjoy
this
slowly
and
enjoy
the
complexity
of
flavor
hard
to
imagine
a
more
drinkable
chile
beer
though
it
would
be
best
with
leftover
baked
turkey
or
chicken
and
probably
not
something
youd
want
every
day
d
good
i
enjoyed
this
with
tacos
and
it
went
well
together
not
sure
if
this
is
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
recommend
it
what
a
fantastic
ale
from
rogue
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
them
and
one
i
hope
they
continue
to
brew
it
goes
down
well
and
is
very
unique
and
great
for
even
those
that
dont
like
spicy
stuff
drink
smooth
light
and
interesting
flavors
maybe
too
interesting
a
pint
or
so
will
do
overall
a
good
beer
and
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
balanced
and
not
overpowering
recommended
for
anyone
slighty
adventuresome
this
isnt
an
ale
u
can
throw
back
a
few
pints
of
but
it
isnt
quite
a
total
sipper
either
that
is
kinda
what
i
expected
and
hoped
for
in
a
beer
has
spice
just
like
food
i
dont
want
somethign
i
need
to
recover
from
with
water
and
time
to
have
another
bite
but
i
want
it
to
have
some
substantial
heat
i
must
admit
i
always
get
a
little
scared
about
chile
beers
i
mean
they
can
either
get
it
just
right
or
sometimes
go
overboard
with
the
chile
taste
which
for
me
ruins
it
i
just
like
that
nice
balance
and
this
beer
is
a
perfect
exampleit
pours
a
deep
golden
amber
colour
with
decent
carbonation
which
leaves
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
slowly
dissapates
to
a
peaky
cap
in
the
middle
with
lacing
all
down
the
sidesthe
first
aroma
i
pick
up
is
smoked
chipotles
with
a
maltyfruity
aroma
lying
in
the
background
its
definately
got
me
interestedit
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
with
the
fruitymalt
tastes
hitting
the
palette
first
which
is
finished
off
with
a
subtle
ting
of
smokey
heat
but
not
overdone
at
all
this
is
definately
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
that
ive
tried
but
hey
its
rogue
that
so
doesnt
suprise
me
if
you
like
bbq
and
spicy
food
then
you
are
going
to
like
this
beer
if
you
dont
then
this
will
not
be
one
for
you
im
hanging
on
to
a
couple
of
bottles
to
do
some
cooking
with
this
would
be
great
in
chili
or
as
a
base
for
a
marinade
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
for
this
reason
if
no
other
one
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
rich
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
fluffy
light
rust
colored
foam
flavors
and
aromas
consist
of
smokey
spicy
chipotle
peppers
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
follows
a
bit
fruity
floral
hops
the
smokiness
is
subtle
the
ale
is
a
notch
or
two
better
than
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
a
tasty
ale
for
sure
future
outlook
a
real
surprise
winner
in
my
book
definitely
a
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
for
the
specific
purpose
of
food
pairings
paired
very
well
with
a
pepperjack
burger
and
id
love
to
try
with
other
spicy
foods
this
is
a
great
beer
for
what
it
is
but
i
would
have
a
real
tough
time
putting
back
a
number
of
them
i
wouldnt
really
order
this
beer
unless
for
some
reason
it
was
the
only
micro
around
at
a
bar
nonetheless
an
interesting
novelty
d
very
good
for
the
style
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
drink
more
than
a
glass
or
two
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
rachbier
with
a
much
spicier
character
i
like
it
better
than
a
traditional
bamberg
style
rauchbier
with
a
very
spicy
aftertaste
i
kind
of
like
it
and
i
think
it
would
be
fantastic
in
the
right
situation
md
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
but
i
think
that
this
is
something
my
palate
could
only
take
one
of
dokay
i
dont
know
why
this
one
bummed
me
out
so
much
i
didnt
really
feel
any
heat
from
this
i
also
expected
alot
more
smoke
flavor
and
scent
although
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
definitely
could
have
used
more
heat
and
flavor
from
the
chilies
nevertheless
this
would
make
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
some
nachos
and
spicy
salsa
more
of
desserts
drink
than
a
bbqbeer
mellow
and
rounded
flavours
with
chilli
in
the
background
almost
like
a
light
barley
wine
22oz
bottle
purchased
at
mckinnons
pours
a
slightly
hazy
red
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
predominantly
like
chipotle
peppers
chipotle
pepper
dominates
the
flavor
too
a
bit
of
a
sweetness
with
fruit
caramel
and
cinnamonlike
notes
and
a
subtle
hotness
toward
the
finish
light
to
medium
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
though
the
subtle
hotness
gets
to
me
after
a
while
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
never
had
a
chile
beer
before
and
i
cant
say
i
think
ill
be
a
fan
of
the
style
glad
to
have
tried
it
well
worth
the
try
but
i
dont
foresee
picking
this
one
up
again
d
no
real
stand
out
chilie
flavors
and
the
bitter
zing
was
not
welcoming
for
large
sips
i
put
this
beer
as
a
spinoff
of
the
great
flavors
found
in
schlenkerlas
marzen
something
about
smoky
beers
just
does
it
for
me
drinkability
very
smooth
for
a
chile
beer
the
balnce
on
this
one
is
amazing
with
the
hops
malt
and
chiles
all
blending
nicely
one
if
not
the
best
in
the
style
that
i
have
had
that
was
not
on
tap
i
will
look
for
this
again
but
one
bomber
at
a
time
is
good
enough
d
i
enjoyed
the
first
12oz
but
after
that
my
tastebuds
really
didnt
get
much
deeper
than
the
smokey
flavors
i
appreciate
this
as
something
different
and
would
drink
it
again
but
it
will
not
be
often
this
is
a
beer
that
would
really
benefit
from
the
right
food
pairing
the
mouth
is
crisp
but
slightly
wetter
than
id
prefer
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
really
different
this
is
my
first
of
the
chili
beers
i
cant
place
the
hot
spice
right
off
its
more
of
a
harsh
bitter
quality
but
as
i
continue
to
drink
this
the
spicy
jalepenos
come
out
in
a
big
way
nice
spicy
aftertaste
this
beer
is
not
for
the
weak
its
different
its
bold
and
i
must
say
its
pretty
dang
good
if
you
like
chipotle
and
smoke
a
lot
youll
probably
find
this
drinkable
personally
i
found
it
overpowered
the
more
pleasant
flavours
here
i
only
drank
about
half
the
bottle
saving
the
rest
for
cooking
you
can
tell
peppers
were
used
but
mostly
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
bit
of
warmth
in
the
throat
typical
rogue
quality
solid
this
would
probably
be
good
with
some
mexican
food
drinkability
only
one
i
will
drink
probably
couldnt
finish
a
bomber
by
myself
3
5
d
one
is
plenty
but
its
a
good
ride
dark
gold
or
light
copperorange
in
color
heavy
and
frothy
foam
head
when
poured
into
a
glass
the
nose
is
pretty
standard
and
does
nothing
to
reveal
the
chipotle
the
attack
of
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
clean
there
is
definitely
some
zip
to
the
flavor
that
actually
drinks
similarly
to
many
hoppy
beers
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
where
is
the
chipotle
you
might
ask
good
question
after
taking
a
sip
you
have
to
be
patient
and
let
it
develop
a
little
bit
in
your
mouth
it
is
very
subtle
and
comes
to
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
tongue
well
after
the
liquid
has
gone
down
your
throat
this
beer
rewards
the
patient
beer
drinker
while
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
probably
more
the
novelty
than
the
actual
quality
perhaps
novelty
adds
to
quality
however
i
just
did
my
best
to
call
the
numbers
as
i
saw
them
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
thought
the
pepper
was
really
balanced
but
a
lot
of
the
people
who
tried
it
with
me
thought
otherwise
the
beer
is
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
and
great
lacing
the
smell
is
whats
the
most
odd
about
this
beer
to
me
it
smelled
a
lot
like
beer
but
it
smelled
almost
like
something
had
gone
wrong
in
the
process
it
didnt
smell
bad
it
just
smelled
different
i
will
attribute
that
to
the
chipotle
peppers
the
taste
is
great
though
with
nice
caramel
overtones
and
not
a
whole
lot
of
smokiness
or
stiff
spicy
flavor
its
in
the
finish
where
the
chipotle
peppers
shine
instead
of
an
alcohol
burn
on
the
way
down
you
get
a
really
nice
warming
sensation
from
the
presence
of
the
peppers
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
cold
winter
night
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
refreshing
considering
the
peppers
definitely
not
a
beer
youll
be
having
more
than
two
of
in
one
evening
had
this
before
the
poker
game
yesterday
poured
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
thick
foamy
white
head
almost
like
what
cooking
caramel
looks
like
plenty
of
lacing
smelled
of
yeast
and
a
little
pepper
tasted
of
malts
a
dash
of
hops
with
a
nice
peppery
kick
wow
incredibly
smooth
considering
the
pepper
no
more
than
two
though
drinkability
is
good
but
now
that
the
person
i
split
this
one
would
not
drink
more
the
a
few
ozs
1
bomber
will
be
all
i
can
handle
rogue
chipotle
ale
is
a
hazy
amber
beer
with
a
fluffy
yellow
head
that
has
great
retention
it
smells
like
a
home
brew
there
are
green
grassy
notes
in
the
nose
but
im
not
picking
up
any
pepper
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
thats
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
clean
dry
finish
theres
a
roasted
malt
flavor
up
front
and
then
the
taste
of
smoky
chipotle
kicks
in
theres
not
much
spice
but
plenty
of
flavor
its
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
slightly
chewy
feel
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
nicely
crisp
drinkable
brew
a
good
ale
with
a
bit
of
complex
spice
and
smoke
added
dwell
i
like
this
well
enough
but
frankly
one
is
enough
for
now
will
seek
it
out
again
spicey
and
smooth
mouthfeel
considering
that
it
burns
as
you
drink
it
its
not
very
drinkable
but
i
like
spicy
food
so
this
isnt
that
bad
to
me
what
a
very
unique
beer
you
either
love
it
or
hate
it
everyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
i
realize
its
a
niche
beer
and
it
probably
lacks
favor
with
the
masses
but
i
wish
it
brought
even
more
chipolte
i
want
to
taste
it
its
a
pleasant
beer
a
fairly
easydrinking
one
still
and
here
i
go
again
i
wonder
what
id
have
if
dfh
did
a
chipolte
ale
i
cant
help
but
think
id
taste
the
pepper
in
that
one
until
then
i
think
this
is
a
neat
beverage
worth
trying
and
id
pick
it
up
again
to
complement
my
comida
de
mexicana
o
mi
bbq
im
thinking
grilled
sausages
on
summer
day
reckon
good
drinkability
on
this
brew
decent
flavor
interesting
although
not
as
powerful
as
i
would
have
liked
i
wasnt
asking
to
breathe
fire
or
anything
i
will
probably
try
this
beer
again
just
because
it
has
such
an
interesting
feel
to
it
overall
about
what
i
expected
as
the
beer
matches
what
is
advertised
on
the
label
well
d
while
its
probably
the
best
out
of
the
few
chile
beers
ive
had
its
a
struggle
to
get
through
a
whole
pint
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
but
not
something
ill
be
buying
again
maybe
good
for
a
mole
black
and
tan
with
rogue
chocolate
stout
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
that
makes
the
sugary
sweet
malt
come
through
the
heat
barrier
wow
what
a
surprise
this
beer
was
we
had
it
at
a
tasting
at
our
house
right
from
the
start
you
could
smell
the
spices
great
color
and
body
the
taste
was
impressive
as
well
strong
hop
flavor
along
with
citrus
but
then
you
can
taste
the
chili
flavor
at
the
tip
of
your
tongue
it
has
a
little
heat
but
it
does
not
linger
we
all
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
picking
up
another
bottle
soon
it
would
pair
well
with
bbq
its
hard
to
rate
drinkability
on
this
its
definitely
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
cant
really
think
of
a
time
when
id
want
a
chipotleflavored
beverage
appearance
out
of
the
pour
was
a
dark
amber
aroma
held
malt
and
smokey
spice
taste
was
typical
ale
with
distinct
smokey
pepper
unique
beer
but
the
smokey
chipotle
flavor
paired
with
a
typical
ale
turned
out
distinct
yet
not
tastey
praise
rogue
for
originality
pours
an
amberhoney
color
slightly
cloudy
with
a
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
mild
with
detectable
caramel
malt
and
honey
notes
taste
is
a
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
jalapeno
that
becomes
more
pronounced
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
keep
on
hand
pours
a
light
copper
topped
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
white
head
retention
isnt
great
but
is
nothing
to
complain
about
smell
is
faint
but
very
distinct
chipotle
peppers
taste
smooth
mild
and
smoky
chipotle
pepper
taste
that
is
very
genuine
the
chipotle
is
the
main
taste
in
the
beer
but
is
not
inyourface
there
is
a
very
thin
malt
sweetness
at
first
that
comes
and
then
goes
accompanied
by
a
carbonic
bite
and
finally
a
bone
dry
semibitter
finish
but
no
real
hop
flavor
high
carbonation
bordering
on
fizzy
but
never
going
over
the
top
i
think
this
would
go
great
with
some
bbq
worth
trying
i
dont
see
this
beer
coming
around
again
though
d
a
great
beer
but
not
one
i
would
drink
repeatedly
i
would
consider
this
good
with
corn
soup
or
mac
and
cheese
since
i
like
tabasco
chipotle
with
pasta
and
cheese
a
well
brewed
chile
beer
proving
it
can
be
made
without
dwarfing
the
taste
of
the
beer
and
doesnt
mask
the
ales
taste
i
found
this
to
nice
when
blended
with
the
10000
brew
at
ebf
and
with
stones
bitter
oatmeal
chocolate
stout
pours
out
into
an
orangereddish
color
with
moderate
head
smells
faintly
of
smoke
and
peppers
taste
is
of
some
smoke
with
the
slow
burn
of
some
mild
hot
peppers
that
lasts
quite
a
while
overall
quote
light
and
not
as
overwhelming
as
some
chili
ales
i
have
sampled
but
the
burn
lasts
longer
than
i
would
expect
i
found
myself
nursing
this
over
a
long
period
of
time
much
longer
than
i
would
have
had
something
similar
without
the
peppers
pours
a
solid
amber
color
with
a
sticky
white
head
that
stays
for
a
good
long
while
it
smells
like
someone
poured
some
kind
of
chili
powder
into
a
stock
ale
odd
to
say
the
least
the
peppery
sensation
sits
in
the
nose
but
isnt
strong
enough
to
make
me
sneeze
or
anything
the
chipotle
taste
isnt
as
powerful
as
i
would
have
originally
thought
instead
it
sits
in
the
mouth
long
after
all
of
the
other
flavors
have
passed
burning
slightly
more
like
pepper
than
anything
else
as
for
the
other
flavors
there
are
some
pretty
decent
hop
notes
that
bitter
the
whole
thing
up
but
they
lose
out
to
the
peppered
flavor
drinkability
i
liked
this
beer
overall
but
i
like
spicy
foods
i
actually
enjoyed
this
while
eating
food
that
had
been
smoked
all
day
which
could
have
prepared
my
taste
buds
for
it
i
have
a
good
amount
of
experience
using
this
pepper
both
whole
and
in
powder
form
and
let
me
tell
you
the
flavor
just
wasnt
there
i
am
very
disappointed
overall
very
easy
to
drink
the
spicy
pepper
aspect
is
pretty
light
so
most
people
will
enjoy
this
beer
nice
sweetness
to
balance
the
spiciness
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
especially
while
eating
some
good
mexican
food
d
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
as
an
occasional
oddity
its
not
bad
i
found
the
taste
to
be
very
interesting
although
not
that
refreshing
and
it
definitely
did
not
leave
me
wanting
more
i
had
it
with
steak
tacos
which
turned
out
to
be
a
great
pairing
ill
probably
drink
this
again
but
not
in
the
near
future
d
if
you
can
handle
the
heat
then
go
ahead
and
hit
a
few
of
these
overall
a
cool
experiment
and
definitely
something
to
try
but
too
overpowering
not
something
i
see
myself
having
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
d
glad
i
had
it
but
hard
to
imagine
ever
drinking
more
than
1
of
these
glad
i
could
share
the
bomber
pours
a
very
golden
body
big
creamy
foamy
head
diminishing
smokey
hoppy
aroma
not
quite
cigarette
but
close
not
ashy
smokey
malty
taste
more
chipotley
now
not
sweet
not
hoppy
clean
aftertaste
the
smoke
is
subtle
would
go
well
wbbq
or
any
grilled
meat
i
would
say
its
an
interesting
beer
to
try
but
best
to
have
a
few
friends
around
to
taste
with
you
as
i
couldnt
do
a
whole
22
by
myself
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
upon
buying
this
one
the
aroma
definitely
has
chipotle
with
the
usual
hops
pours
deep
amber
with
a
medium
tan
head
the
taste
is
actually
very
mild
hoppy
and
malty
the
chipotle
takes
a
back
seat
you
can
taste
it
but
its
not
like
that
horrible
it
wasnt
to
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
pepper
beer
the
chipotle
was
far
from
overpowering
and
could
have
been
increased
without
being
offensive
i
love
rogue
beers
and
i
really
like
spicy
food
but
felt
that
this
beer
was
just
awful
it
was
too
hot
and
actually
tasted
like
chipotle
or
like
it
had
to
be
spiced
with
jalapeno
i
had
it
on
tap
and
had
to
force
myself
to
drink
this
beer
like
i
was
back
in
rugby
hazing
id
rather
have
a
tequila
shot
and
i
hate
tequila
my
overall
impression
of
this
is
that
its
a
novelty
beer
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
but
because
of
the
hop
and
spice
mix
something
i
know
doesnt
mix
well
with
alot
of
foods
id
have
a
hard
time
pairing
it
and
would
limit
it
to
rare
occasions
when
id
want
an
odd
beer
out
you
know
what
youre
getting
yourself
into
when
you
order
a
chipotle
ale
and
this
one
was
quite
good
id
definitely
order
it
again
but
id
need
some
time
in
between
i
can
imagine
this
pairing
nicely
with
a
lot
of
american
mexican
cuisine
i
would
maybe
like
a
little
more
hop
presence
a
little
less
malt
in
a
beer
like
this
as
the
malts
just
end
up
stale
and
boring
to
me
still
an
easy
drinking
good
beer
to
pair
with
meals
in
the
summer
big
fan
of
rogue
but
can
do
without
this
one
i
would
recommend
to
others
to
try
it
but
will
not
plan
on
doing
this
one
again
d
delicious
wellbalanced
mix
of
spice
and
sweet
it
can
be
a
refreshing
break
during
a
night
of
strong
beers
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
i
love
smoked
beers
rauchbiers
etc
this
one
soft
of
tastes
like
a
mixture
rogues
american
amber
with
a
hint
of
their
smoke
ale
both
of
which
are
my
favorites
so
its
not
surprising
that
i
like
this
get
it
interesting
beer
well
worth
a
taste
as
it
is
well
balanced
in
flavors
and
the
heat
compliments
and
doesnt
overwelm
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
is
not
my
usual
beer
experience
a
style
of
its
own
i
think
taste
has
some
of
the
same
cardboard
that
was
present
in
the
nose
sweet
malts
are
pretty
dominant
with
a
short
bright
burst
of
hop
bitterness
in
mid
to
late
sip
the
smoky
peppers
finally
come
through
on
the
very
end
with
a
lingering
and
quite
noticeable
heat
in
the
back
of
the
throat
i
like
that
but
then
again
i
like
really
spicy
food
i
could
see
this
being
a
turn
off
for
many
i
think
i
might
try
to
score
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
and
see
if
it
is
any
better
d
i
think
a
couple
sips
of
this
is
enough
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
of
the
flavor
but
i
found
myself
having
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
this
is
definitely
beer
with
character
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
try
it
again
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color

a
large
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
smokey
and
earthy
aroma
the
flavor
likewise
is
very
rauchbier
in
charactor
very
smokey
with
a
little
spice
kick
and
heat
coming
in
on
the
finish
at
the
back
of
the
throat
has
enough
of
a
body
to
carry
the
smoke
and
chile
spice
moderate
carbonation
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
much
of
or
often
for
that
matter
a

s
subtle
smoke
on
the
nose
along
with
the
zest
of
the
jalapenos
very
earthy
aroma
hops
are
hard
to
discern
but
a
hearty
malt
backing
is
apparent
a
more
pleasant
smell
than
i
would
generally
expect
from
a
chile
beer

a

d
chile
beers
certainly
arent

draw
to
me

is
reasonable

the
point
of
making
it
quite
drinkable

poured
a

my
guiness
pint
glass

thin
onefinger

quickly
dissipated
and
left
little
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
throughout
the
drink
aroma
is
a
lot
of
malt
with
the
chipotle
spiciness
detectable
mouthfeel
is
bland
mediumbodied
and
medium
carbonation
taste
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
smokiness
from
the
chipotle
in
the
middle
then
a
twinge
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
finishes
with
an
odd
smoky
spiciness
this
beer
has
to
be
pretty
warm
to
get
the
full
effect
of
the
active
ingredient
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
think
drinkability
is
moderate
for
the
style
im
sure
this
is
pretty
good
but
as
a
standalone
brew
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
one
of
the
top
rated
beers
for
style
a
threefinger
tan
head
tops
off
a
reddishorange
brew
retention
is
good
with
some
streaking
diminutive
chunks
of
lace
left
here
and
there
around
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
involves
not
surprisingly
some
spicy
peppers
malts
and
citrus
the
taste
is
as
unique
as
the
smell
with
some
good
peppery
notes
that
linger
in
the
aftertaste
and
keep
things
fairly
hot
throughout
the
hops
and
malts
mix
in
right
underneath
the
peppers
and
are
a
bit
overshadowed
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
its
light
on
the
carbonation
rogue
can
be
hit
or
miss
sometimes
but
as
with
the
hazelnut
brown
this
one
blends
unique
elements
to
make
interesting
and
very
drinkable
brews
d
best
peppered
beer
that
ive
had
so
far
still
tastes
like
beer
actually
something
drinkable
i
like
it
and
next
time
i
make
enchiladas
im
gonna
buy
it
again
other
than
that
i
cant
imagine
drinking
it
again
though
overall
it
accomplishes
what
it
set
out
to
do
perfectly
but
it
just
isnt
particularly
appealing
or
complex
its
a
great
novelty
but
not
a
great
beer
got
a
bomber
of
this
super
great
this
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
great
unfiltered
orange
appearance
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
great
really
unique
not
much
of
hops
a
bit
of
sweet
carmel
malts
but
loaded
with
bbq
hickory
smokiness
which
is
just
really
unique
and
interesting
in
a
good
way
the
smokiness
is
definltey
stronger
in
the
nose
than
the
mouth
the
taste
is
much
spicer
and
accute
than
the
smell
that
is
less
pin
pointed
less
smokey
much
more
chile
chiptole
jalepenos
tickles
the
palate
on
the
way
out
everything
i
wanted
in
this
beer
in
regards
to
taste
tons
of
notes
reminding
me
of
bbqs
hickory
chips
and
tons
of
hot
peppers
the
drinkability
isnt
too
high
in
regards
to
quantity
but
for
quality
i
think
it
really
is
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
really
really
happy
with
this
another
great
beer
from
rogue
i
thought
this
beer
was
very
good
the
smell
of
chipotle
peppers
was
strong
the
taste
was
very
smokey
if
you
hate
these
two
attributes
then
you
will
no
doubt
hate
this
beer
but
as
a
chile
head
and
a
fan
of
all
things
smokey
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
had
this
with
spicy
chile
and
would
buy
it
again
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
cook
with
as
well
as
drink
with
bbq
or
mexican
di
did
not
care
for
this
beer
i
think
the
pepper
flavors
were
too
prominent
which
left
no
room
for
other
beer
flavors
to
represent
an
interesting
beer
to
try
but
i
wont
be
trying
this
one
again
in
the
future
cheers
im
getting
a
little
heartburn
from
an
entire
bomber
of
this
stuff
one
is
good
enough
but
damn
if
this
is
not
one
fine
chile
beer
i
just
cracked
this
after
having
it
for
a
while
i
must
say
im
pleasantly
surprised
very
normal
color
and
the
head
is
good
the
smell
is
a
little
odd
probably
the
peppers
in
there
when
i
taste
it
theres
a
little
malt
not
a
lot
of
hops
the
chipotle
is
very
nice
on
the
back
end
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
you
will
need
to
have
a
taste
for
it
very
nice
drinker
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
upon
buying
this
one
the
aroma
definitely
has
chipotle
with
the
usual
hops
pours
deep
amber
with
a
medium
tan
head
the
taste
is
actually
very
mild
hoppy
and
malty
the
chipotle
takes
a
back
seat
you
can
taste
it
but
its
not
like
that
horrible
cave
creek
chili
beer
it
was
enjoyable
but
i
probably
wont
buy
this
one
again
its
smoky
and
smooth
and
very
clean
tasting
i
really
cant
describe
more
than
that
this
is
truly
a
strange
brew
dont
know
if
ill
ever
buy
it
again
but
its
pairing
well
with
my
spicy
chicken
sandwich
this
is
my
first
spiced
beer
i
have
ever
tried
and
the
only
reason
i
even
got
this
is
to
try
all
the
rogues
i
have
never
tried
i
was
not
impressed
at
all
by
this
one
poured
a
red
color
with
a
good
2
finger
head
on
it
pepper
comes
out
in
the
nose
right
away
and
thats
pretty
much
all
im
pulling
out
of
this
one
taste
as
it
smells
very
peppery
very
spicy
especially
in
the
end
good
med
bodied
feel
to
it
i
will
not
drink
this
again
taste
is
really
complicated
you
dont
notice
any
heat
until
a
couple
seconds
after
the
sip
its
followed
up
by
a
lot
of
burnt
smokyness
like
charring
a
marshmallow
at
a
campfire
a
little
too
much
its
very
faint
though
good
balance
between
the
sweet
and
some
of
the
darkermore
acrid
crystal
malts
hops
have
a
definite
consistent
presence
throughout
the
experience
lending
a
nice
floral
juicyness
to
the
beer
that
rounds
out
some
of
the
more
extreme
flavors
i
keep
getting
little
pangs
of
heat
in
my
mouth
but
its
completely
unnoticeable
when
youre
actually
drinking
the
beer
i
think
if
you
bumped
the
alcohol
up
on
this
a
bit
and
took
out
the
peppers
itd
just
be
a
good
british
barleywine
but
its
not
its
got
peppers
and
its
doing
its
own
thing
good
enough
for
me
not
totally
irresistable
but
its
got
a
lot
gong
on
there
and
they
did
it
right
without
making
me
feel
like
im
drinking
alcoholic
fireball
water
mouthfeel
is
if
anything
a
little
undercarbonated
you
sort
of
have
to
draw
a
fine
line
because
much
more
and
youd
be
interfering
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
bit
more
for
the
mouthfeel
and
also
to
improve
some
of
the
heads
performance
pretty
easy
drinking
too
the
hops
really
pull
through
as
the
saving
factor
for
both
drinkability
and
the
spicy
flavor
if
they
werent
there
i
probably
wouldnt
like
the
beer
at
all
but
it
all
comes
together
very
well
and
im
impressed
that
they
did
it
smooth
and
rich
with
a
nice
semifull
body
i
think
this
is
where
it
shines
with
the
mouthfeel
the
spice
isnt
a
fire
just
a
mild
spice
and
the
smoke
makes
it
flavorful
and
adds
complexity
cheers
rogue
nicely
done
i
feel
like
a
chile
beer
is
a
novelty
act
this
one
tastes
good
if
your
in
the
mood
for
some
sadist
beer
drinking
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
spicy
food
and
a
good
beer
but
i
get
real
tired
of
this
one
fast
i
judge
beer
mostly
on
whether
or
not
id
buy
it
again
as
for
appearance
smell
taste
yada
yada
yada
this
one
gets
semi
high
marks
but
only
when
confined
to
the
style
other
then
for
cooking
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
again
d
obviously
one
wouldnt
want
to
session
this
beer
but
its
quite
drinkable
because
the
intensity
from
the
peppers
isnt
overbearing
though
the
flavor
is
sufficient
another
solid
beer
from
rogue
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
im
glad
i
didnt
listen
to
some
warnings
from
others
for
an
interesting
beer
this
is
a
great
try
thats
worth
coming
back
for
again
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
this
style
of
specialy
ale
but
this
really
was
quite
the
tasty
beer
kinda
a
malty
brown
ale
with
a
big
addition
of
spice
probably
something
i
will
buy
again
though
im
not
sure
when
this
beer
feels
like
a
series
of
wrongs
that
add
up
to
a
right
each
attribute
has
deficient
areas
but
all
together
they
seem
overall
minor
good
beer
and
will
become
my
beer
of
choice
for
the
chile
beer
category
ok
this
is
what
it
is
a
very
spicy
well
crafted
beer
of
its
kind
you
will
like
it
if
you
are
a
fan
of
hot
buffalo
chicken
wings
if
you
cant
stand
the
heat
stay
out
of
the
kitchen
i
feel
its
one
of
the
best
of
its
type
and
worth
a
try
dont
be
a
cry
baby
with
minimal
head
taste
is
smooth
before
a
mild
bite
of
heat
at
the
end
there
is
a
lingering
oily
heat
present
from
the
peppers
that
are
infused
into
the
beer

you
will
enjoy

absolutely
love

as
for

and
honestly
its
giving

its

you

that

was

definitely
not
a
session
beer
i
dont
want
to
penalize
the
beer
to
much
though
since
i
think
its
very
true
to
its
style
just
not
for
everyone
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
is
exactly
what
it
claims
to
be
on
the
bottle
a
delicate
smooth
crisp
flavor
with
a
subtle
smokey
chipotle
finish
cheers
aye
carumba
a
spicy
beer
that
works
rather
than
burns
and
offends
this
is
a
solid
rogue
ale
with
that
great
roasted
chipotle
taste
on
the
finish
no
it
doesnt
scour
your
mouth
out
but
rather
it
works
with
any
spicy
food
or
even
better
try
it
with
food
that
is
not
spicy
like
a
bowl
of
vegetable
soup
it
brings
its
own
spice
to
the
table
it
is
totally
drinkable
by
itself
there
is
a
smokiness
to
the
finish
like
a
lighter
version
of
rogue
smoke
cool
beer
that
is
a
benchmark
for
the
style
i
would
be
curious
as
to
the
abv
on
this
one
above
it
says
quentincompsonapr
25
caramel
color
with
a
light
tan
head
and
has
plenty
of
carbonation
and
very
little
lacing
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
to
along
with
some
spicy
undertone
and
a
mild
citrus
smell
i
think
this
is
a
good

aroma
was
lacking
i
did
pick
up
a
slight
pepper
scent
when
i
tasted
it
i
was
blown
away
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
this
before
and
at
first
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
flavor
you
can
really
taste
the
chipotle
flavor
the
more
i
drank
of
this
beer
the
more
i
appreciated
it
overall
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
its
a
good
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
nice
rich
honey
amber
color
with
a
good
frothy
whitish
head
smells
of
a
touch
of
sweetness
as
it
warms
but
mostly
of
hops
and
a
slight
bit
of
spicy
heat
yet
not
a
smoky
chipotle
spice
smell
at
all
taste
is
surprisingly
smooth
hoppy
faintly
sweet
a
decent
bit
bitter
and
perhaps
the
faintest
bite
of
spice
but
it
might
also
just
be
flavor
from
the
hops
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
nice
it
does
have
a
warming
effect
in
the
chest
area
after
it
goes
down
also
but
its
definitely
not
a
chipotle
smell
or
smoked
taste
on
the
palate
subtle
but
still
nice
and
even
though
i
was
expecting
a
touch
more
hearty
spicy
smokiness
from
the
chipotle
it
may
have
made
for
an
overly
spicy
unenjoyable
beer
this
may
be
the
right
spice
level
but
i
wish
it
had
a
hint
of
smokiness
still
overall
pretty
well
balanced
but
maybe
not
what
youd
expect
from
looking
at
the
bottle
good
but
was
a
bit
pricy
at
5
50
for
a
22
oz
bottle
i
liked
this
beer
more
and
more
as
i
drank
it
d
hard
to
say
i
rated
it
average
as
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
chile
beer
id
definitely
drink
this
one
again
but
im
not
sure
when
id
be
in
the
mood
for
it
drinkability
i
felt
that
it
was
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
for
all
the
time
but
is
a
good
change
of
pace
a
very
nice
refreshing
sessionable
ale
from
rogue
pours
a
cloudy
amber
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
brew
nose
is
muted
but
with
a
touch
of
a
sweet
edge
flavor
is
actually
pretty
damn
good
starts
off
with
an
almost
overly
sweet
tone
which
slowly
morphs
into
something
smoky
and
clean
the
smoked
peppers
actually
keep
in
your
mouth
over
time
as
it
warms
up
the
smokey
flavors
really
come
out
feel
is
a
bit
thin
and
it
is
drinkable
though
a
22
oz
bomber
might
be
a
bit
too
much
for
one
person
in
one
sitting
even
though
this
is
a
chile
beer
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
isnt
for
everyone
i
personally
enjoy
it
as
i
really
like
spicy
foods
this
beer
would
definitely
go
well
with
a
burger
or
something
more
i
feel
its
well
done
for
the
style
as
well
d
the
heat
is
a
nice
tingle
but
i
expected
more
smoke
too
raisiny
for
my
taste
i
was
given
this
bottle
as
a
gift
a
while
back
in
the
interim
i
was
able
to
sample
this
on
draught
at
slows
bbq
in
detroit
for
only
2
on
draught
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
smoky
beer
with
a
bit
of
heat
that
complimented
the
bbq
well
maybe
i
waited
too
long
to
crack
this
bottle
open
but
im
not
getting
much
of
the
heat
component
here
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
what
im
tasting
now
is
sweet
and
smoky
rather
than
smoky
and
hot
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
where
it
shines
with
its
nice
cloudy
deep
brown
color
and
quickly
dissipating
head
the
aroma
is
smoky
but
could
be
more
intense
again
could
be
a
function
of
my
waiting
to
open
the
bottle
regardless
this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
is
worth
seeking
out
it
would
work
great
in
a
chili
recipe
recommended
unlike
most
novelty
beers
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
if
it
were
cheaper
id
try
it
again
but
there
are
so
many
outstanding
bombers
available
for
just
1
more
in
columbus
this
was
4
like
hop
rod
rye
the
avery
barleywine
yeah
especially
those
two
im
glad
a
rogue
flavor
bomber
finally
came
through
for
me
the
only
reason
you
should
drink
this
is
if
you
hate
beer
and
you
only
want
the
alcohol
feel
is
thick
and
chunky
sandpapery
leaves
a
smoky
film
in
fact
the
overall
word
is
smoky
its
sweet
but
pungent
really
interesting
d
not
so
much
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
ugh
i
tried
to
file
a
beerspy
report
unfortunately
once
you
pick
new
hampshire
you
have
14
stores
to
chose
from
and
there
is
no
othernot
listed
purchased
from
wine
society
in
north
nashua
nh
which
has
a
small
handpicked
selection
of
beers
and
no
dust
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
appropriately
carbonated
this
is
definitely
a
bit
of
a
novelty
beer
and
not
something
id
have
very
often
but
id
have
it
again
if
the
mood
struck
me
right
now
i
start
to
get
the
chile
parts
of
the
beera
little
burning
in
the
back
of
the
throat
from
the
jalapenos
very
balanced
thoughamazingly
drinkable
very
good
overall
i
dont
know
how
old
this
is
or
how
age
has
affected
it
but
very
good
and
very
subtle
with
the
chileexpertly
done
amber
color
with
a
crusty
rocky
offwhite
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
clings
to
the
sides
not
much
aroma
faint
caramel
and
slightly
fruity
malt
notes
and
just
hint
of
some
bitter
hop
esters
dry
grains
and
dry
bitter
hops
up
front
and
earthy
woody
notes
in
the
back
chipotle
heat
is
perceived
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
esophagus
and
minimally
on
the
palate
i
dont
know
how
they
achieved
this
but
its
nice
that
the
chipotle
heat
doesnt
wreck
the
palate
midway
through
a
slight
sweetness
develops
along
with
some
organic
soily
smoky
notes
the
finish
is
pretty
much
clean
at
first
but
then
chipotle
flavor
arrives
way
late
light
to
medium
body
and
mouthfeel
is
about
average
could
have
done
with
something
thinner
chipotle
flavor
becomes
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
but
still
much
lighter
than
i
remember
it
the
previous
couple
of
times
ive
had
this
beer
d
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
it
again
i
like
spicy
foods
but
not
a
big
fan
of
spicy
beers
d
this
is
a
great
tasty
treat
but
would
be
difficult
to
drink
iin
session
the
chipotle
taste
might
get
annoying
after
a
while
d
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
blown
away
by
chipotle
peppers
in
this
one
but
i
was
surprised
at
how
mild
the
flavor
was
the
peppers
were
presented
very
tastefully
i
love
trying
unique
brews
like
this
and
i
think
they
are
very
interesting
drinkability
is
high
but
its
a
novelty
treat
rather
than
something
i
want
all
the
time
job
well
done
seriously
undrinkable
i
couldnt
even
finish
a
sample
i
love
rogue
but
theres
no
reason
to
buy
this
other
than
to
go
dude
check
out
how
weird
this
beer
is
or
maybe
to
use
as
a
marinade
for
beef
jerky
i
guess
it
does
technically
deliver
what
it
says
it
will
deliver
but
i
just
cant
in
good
conscience
give
this
a
good
review
drinkability
was
high
although
i
couldnt
really
see
paying
for
it
the
beer
was
dark
yellow
golden
colored
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
surprisingly
hoppy
i
didnt
get
any
chili
peppers
out
of
the
smell
the
taste
was
citrucy
hoppy
and
a
bit
spicy
but
the
spicy
heat
must
have
come
from
peppers
instead
of
hops
it
was
really
pretty
nice
against
the
weak
caramel
malt
flavors
in
the
background
i
plan
to
try
it
again
from
the
bottle
sometime
poured
into
my
hennepin
glass
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
healthy
inch
head
that
settles
slowly
into
a
lacy
12
inch
or
so
the
beer
is
cloudy
and
i
dont
see
much
carbonation
the
smell
starts
out
with
a
nice
fruity
gummi
bear
like
hop
aroma
backed
immediately
with
a
smooth
and
sticky
malt
character
the
taste
is
interesting
the
taste
is
much
like
an
apa
with
a
malt
undertone
topped
with
a
smooth
mildtomoderate
hop
bitterness
the
chile
peppers
are
faint
but
noticeable
right
in
the
middle
of
the
drink
the
pepper
taste
isnt
there
but
the
oil
and
waxy
pepper
effect
is
present
a
slightly
metallic
spice
and
a
bitterness
that
is
separate
from
the
bitterness
given
by
any
hop
ive
had
gives
it
away
it
sits
more
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
has
a
residual
consistent
effect
after
you
rest
a
few
minutes
from
drinking
it
the
pepper
taste
opens
up
a
bit
more
with
an
acidic
green
chile
resemblance
taste
not
as
spicy
or
different
than
i
expected
comes
across
at
first
as
lightly
to
moderately
hoppy
then
getting
stronger
in
the
hop
department
going
down
a
slight
burning
sensation
remains
in
the
mouth
and
throat
after
a
pretty
clean
finish
peppery
character
comes
across
faintly
towards
the
middle
but
you
really
have
to
be
looking
for
it
or
youll
miss
it
good
beer
but
slightly
disappointing
overall
more
drinkable
than
expected
ive
tried
cave
creek
chili
beer
before
and
it
was
near
unbearable
so
when
i
picked
this
up
it
was
more
an
experiment
a
good
one
cheers
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
is
one
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
to
enjoy
not
recommended
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
im
always
a
little
leery
of
a
chile
beer
but
this
was
really
quite
good
drinkability
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
maybe
a
bit
pricey
but
not
too
bad
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
of
beers
similar
in
style
this
is
probably
about
average
if
i
had
to
buy
it
i
would
probably
settle
for
a
beer
a
little
lighter
on
the
wallet
but
with
similar
taste
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
go
out
and
buy
a
case
of
but
if
my
buddy
offered
it
to
me
id
have
no
problem
drinking
it
drinkability
i
think
its
a
good
beer
this
is
my
first
chili
beer
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
an
interesting
combination
try
one
chipotle
ale
pours
a
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
but
there
is
a
hint
of
some
heat
too
this
beer
has
a
very
malty
flavor
with
only
a
hint
of
chili
pepper
which
mostly
is
noticeable
as
a
mild
heat
toward
the
end
of
the
sip
rather
than
as
a
flavor
although
there
is
some
flavor
from
the
chili
peppers
it
is
quite
muted
not
bad
the
only
other
chili
flavored
beer
ive
had
is
that
abomination
made
by
cave
creek
thankfully
this
fares
quite
a
bit
better
worth
a
try
if
only
to
say
youve
had
a
chili
flavored
beer
d
for
me
this
is
an
occasional
beer
its
tasty
but
not
something
id
want
all
the
time
definitely
worth
a
try
though
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
somewhat
thick
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
balance
seems
fine
honestly
i
think
this
would
be
better
if
you
were
left
with
just
the
smoky
element
and
didnt
have
the
pepper
bite
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
something
i
would
be
likely
to
pick
up
again
im
torn
as
to
whether
i
should
deduct
points
for
the
lack
of
spiciness
in
the
end
ive
decided
to
make
the
marks
reflect
the
quality
of
the
beer
nice
orangyamber
color
with
a
great
aroma
of
smoke
and
pepper
good
mouthfeel
not
too
thin
but
a
slight
dryness
flavor
has
a
wonderful
smoke
up
front
with
a
clean
spicy
finish
good
malt
flavors
linger
in
the
background
with
a
subtle
sweetness
not
much
hop
character
to
speak
of
with
the
peppers
and
all
fantastic
beer
the
smoke
flavor
is
great
and
from
what
i
understand
its
all
from
the
smoked
peppers
no
smoked
malt
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beverages
poured
from
the
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
body
is
somewhere
between
orange
and
maroon
in
color
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
that
instantly
recedes
to
a
thin
halo
aroma
is
first
and
foremost
chipotle
chili
pepper
with
some
lightly
sweet
malt
providing
a
little
balance
palate
is
mellow
lightly
sweet
malt
up
front
with
the
chipotle
pepper
building
towards
the
back
of
the
mouth
finish
is
a
good
blend
of
sweet
malt
and
pepper
but
without
a
particularly
high
level
of
heat
mouthfeel
is
akin
to
an
english
pub
ale
smooth
and
velvety
without
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
a
great
pairing
with
my
spicy
black
bean
chili
although
its
not
exactly
a
beer
for
everyday
drinking
d
a
good
beer
would
go
well
with
mexican
food
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
robustness
in
the
pepper
aspect
of
this
beer
but
overall
it
was
a
good
experience
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
with
this
one
revisited
it
the
smokey
flavor
was
a
little
intense
at
times
but
for
a
chili
beer
i
was
very
impressed
i
would
consider
trying
it
again
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
and
as
most
rogue
beers
extremely
well
carbonated
very
drinkable
if
nothing
else
was
around
i
could
probably
session
this
if
i
had
to
but
rogue
makes
more
than
a
few
better
session
beers
than
this
overall
its
pretty
good
better
than
i
was
expecting
check
it
out
d
pretty
solid
a
slightly
spicy
flavor
that
i
hadnt
had
before
and
is
balanced
well
providing
an
interesting
and
different
finish
of
chili
instead
of
hops
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
slightly
filling
while
this
beer
is
more
drinkable
than
most
beers
of
the
style
that
try
to
burn
your
mouth
i
believe
this
might
be
a
much
better
beer
to
cook
with
than
to
drink
this
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
rocky
head
that
quickly
fell
the
aroma
is
malty
and
smoky
the
taste
is
smoky
and
malty

pepper
is
noticeable
but
not
overbearing
there
is
a
slight
pepper
aftertaste
but
not
a
burn
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
seems
a
bit
oily
im
surprised
at
how
drinkable
this
is
i
might
not
have
several
in
a
row
but
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
not
intimidating
in
the
heat
department
ill
be
honest
i
expected
more
chipotle
kick
but
nonetheless
this
beer
is
very
solid
very
drinkable
and
could
easily
qualify
as
session
brew
d
good
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
a
sort
of
novelty
beer
that
ive
had
one
or
two
excellent
examples
of
one
by
calapooia
comes
to
mind
this
isnt
bad
but
isnt
one
id
have
very
often
either
worth
a
try
this
feels
a
bit
thick
on
the
tongue
for
the
taste
i
think
this
could
benefit
from
a
bit
more
carbonation
considering
the
spicy
aftertaste
this
is
not
something
i
would
try
to
drink
more
than
one
of
the
combination
of
flavours
make
this
a
potent
brew
di
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
as
i
love
both
rogue
and
chipotle
peppers
i
was
hoping
this
could
be
an
ingredient
in
my
chili
as
the
chipotle
should
have
added
to
the
effect
this
is
basically
a
dumbed
down
rogue
offering
average
body
and
carbonation
this
one
is
good
at
first
but
too
warm
for
the
lack
of
intense
flavor
that
i
had
expected
smooth
and
light
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
in
a
wierd
savory
kind
of
way
paired
very
nicely
with
a
portabella
burger
i
will
buy
again
although
i
couldnt
drink
pint
after
pint
of
this
interesting
ale
i
do
appreciate
the
creativity
inherent
in
the
recipe
the
chipotle
flavor
is
not
overpowering
and
is
quite
interesting
i
will
purchase
this
brew
again
and
have
already
started
thinking
about
fun
food
pairings
well
ive
been
a
fan
of
rogue
beers
for
many
years
so
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
ale
it
made
me
almost
nervous
that
it
was
made
with
chipotle
peppers
but
it
really
didnt
have
an
overly
spicy
taste
the
hotness
shows
up
on
the
finish
a
little
it
is
clean
and
pure
and
thats
classic
rogue
style
but
the
body
was
also
light
and
a
tad
simple
it
would
be
easy
to
pound
a
few
of
these
that
is
if
you
like
peppers
very
nice
beer
id
buy
this
again
specifically
to
drink
with
a
bbq
meal
rogue
once
again
pulls
out
a
different
fantastic
beer
the
appearance
is
orange
and
red
a
little
bit
hazy
smells
of
sweet
roasted
peppers
and
the
taste
is
similar
very
interesting
flavor
spicy
and
sweet
with
roasted
flavors
which
become
more
intense
as
the
beer
is
consumed
bold
beer
not
an
everyday
drinking
beer
but
should
be
a
treat
on
occasions
dont
drink
and
review
the
drinkability
of
this
was
surprisingly
high
ive
always
been
really
skeptical
of
chili
beers
ever
since
first
reading
about
them
in
papizans
homebrewing
book
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
really
pleasantly
surprised
i
didnt
get
chance
to
session
with
this
so
i
cant
say
if
the
pepper
would
build
but
from
what
i
had
i
wanted
more
the
beer
poured
a
crisp
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
diminished
to
a
ring
the
aroma
was
mostly
malt
with
some
pepper
spiciness
to
it
the
taste
was
mostly
dominated
by
hot
peppers
but
they
showed
themselves
the
strongest
when
you
hold
the
beer
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
rather
light
and
surprisingly
smooth
if
you
can
take
the
heat
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
just
not
something
id
drink
all
that
often
tastes
great
much
more
complex
than
the
nose
big
salami
and
charcoal
in
the
front
moving
into
a
lightly
sweet
big
malt
middle
and
then
the
nodes
of
smokey
yellow
cheese
kick
up
moving
into
perfectly
spicey
but
light
pepper
not
at
all
hot
just
peppery
wonderfully
blaalnced
pepper
burn
lingers
lightly
drinkability
definatly
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
im
really
diggin
the
smokey
flavors
the
peppers
and
the
heat
this
brew
has
i
would
definatly
reccomend
this
to
any
chile
head
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
with
some
spicy
foods
especially
mexican
spanish
this
is
by
far
the
best
chile
beer
ive
had
i
expected
the
chile
flavor
to
dominate
everything
but
instead
it
is
a
pleasant
addition
to
the
balanced
malt
and
hops
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
d
one
a
night
is
about
all
i
can
handle
for
myself
this
is
not
a
session
beer
might
go
nice
with
mexican
food
rather
enjoyed
this
one
think
it
would
be
a
good
compliment
to
certain
foods
pours
a
nice
fizzy
head
thats
white
the
color
is
almost
an
orangelike
brown
the
head
doesnt
retain
too
well
and
and
doesnt
leave
a
full
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
spicy
but
smells
a
bit
like
tobacco
at
the
same
time
the
taste
is
tobacco
like
as
well
and
has
the
same
spiciness
as
the
smell
the
spice
is
unmistakeable
its
about
like
taking
a
drink
of
watered
down
tobacco
spit
it
leaves
me
a
little
nausious
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
fizzy
overall
i
will
never
try
this
style
again
it
makes
me
want
to
throw
up
brew
overall
light
and
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
beer
for
those
who
like
that
chipotle
smoked
taste
drinkability
unique
easy
to
drink
more
a
novelty
then
session
because
of
its
roots
as
an
amber
ale
a
rich
caramel
malt
backbone
blends
with
the
chile
flavor
and
keeps
it
in
check
still
the
chipotle
largely
dominates
and
leaves
a
mild
and
spicy
bitterness
an
easy
mouthfeel
makes
for
good
drinking
and
along
with
its
strong
carbonation
this
brew
cleanses
the
palate
and
really
washes
down
food
this
can
feel
little
rich
however
if
drank
by
itself
the
beer
pours
an
amberorange
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
weak
but
i
can
smell
roasted
peppers
and
a
bit
of
malt
it
tastes
like
spicy
roasted
peppers
and
has
a
hoppy
finish
but
its
not
as
spicy
as
i
expected
the
heatspice
does
get
stronger
and
tastes
better
the
more
of
it
i
drink
but
the
spicyness
isnt
overwhelming
at
all
mouthfeel
is
light
and
its
oily
and
smooth
drinkability
is
good
too
it
goes
down
easy
all
in
all
its
a
decent
beer
id
definitely
drink
it
again
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
because
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
drinkability
i
wouldnt
have
wanted
any
more
of
this
i
would
like
to
try
it
mixed
with
rogues
chocolate
stout
however
ive
heard
its
a
good
combination
good
beer
but
probably
too
weird
for
me
to
drink
again
under
my
own
steam
again
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
and
i
wouldnt
mind
another
one
about
now
this
beer
pours
amber
with
orange
highlights
and
little
head
no
lacing
smells
quite
smokey
and
roasted
with
a
taste
of
well
roasted
peppers
to
be
honest
i
dont
really
like
this
it
is
an
odd
flavor
to
me
and
im
from
texas
its
not
disgusting
i
could
still
finish
it
i
just
wont
spend
more
money
on
another
bottle
courtesy
of
adrian910ss
poured
a
medium
amber
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
quite
good
retention
aroma
of
light
chilli
is
interesting
and
less
prominent
then
expected
taste
of
subtle
spicy
chilli
is
very
interesting
and
not
gross
at
all
some
smoky
flavours
are
also
noticeable
and
enjoyable
with
a
medium
hoppy
finish
that
complements
very
well
this
beer
this
beer
was
way
better
then
expected
and
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
an
interesting
offering
from
the
brewers
on
the
bay
this
ale
would
pair
well
with
latin
or
cajun
seafood
dishes
definitely
drinkable
i
wish
there
were
a
few
more
ounces
in
my
glass
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
coming
into
this
beer
but
it
definitely
wasnt
bad
not
something
i
would
revisit
regularly
but
worth
a
try
at
the
least
a
very
interesting
brew
from
rogue
to
say
the
least
brewed
with
quality
and
quite
original
i
really
enjoy
anything
hot
from
hot
sauces
to
hot
peppers
so
i
was
glad
to
see
an
infusion
of
two
of
my
favorite
things
im
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
would
have
in
one
sitting
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
for
my
first
chili
beer
its
not
bad
but
still
not
the
thing
id
seek
out
on
a
regular
a
good
niche
beer
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
amber
color
nice
carbonation
not
much
of
a
head
some
lacing
throughout
the
drink
but
not
a
whole
lot
the
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
hops
spices
and
caramel
the
taste
is
kinda
smokey
and
sweet
malts
theres
a
good
touch
of
caramel
in
there
medium
body
drinkable
my
first
chile
beer
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
would
recommend
poured
this
beer
from
a
22oz
bomber
the
color
was
burnt
orange
with
a
small
head
the
first
sip
tastes
like
a
normal
ale
then
the
spice
hits
i
would
say
it
has
more
cinnamon
characteristics
than
chile
peppers
but
it
was
very
interesting
and
it
worked
well
for
me
this
beer
should
be
in
every
mexican
restaurant
and
it
is
one
to
try
speaking
of
pepper
heads
i
am
one
ironically
chipotles
are
my
least
favorite
pepper
even
though
theyre
all
the
rage
now
ive
had
a
couple
of
extreme
pepper
beers
and
theyre
nasty
nasty
nasty
this
beer
is
not
one
of
those
its
not
great
but
it
is
approachable
dranks
okay
i
could
having
a
couple
with
a
burger
bbq
or
chilli
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
stlye
but
is
better
than
most
others
ive
tried
i
love
peppers
and
i
love
beer
i
even
love
eating
peppers
while
im
drinking
beer
but
a
beer
whose
primary
almost
sole
noticeable
ingredient
is
peppers
no
thanks
rogue
makes
many
good
beers
and
ive
enjoyed
most
of
them
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentytwo
ounce
brown
glass
bomber
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
and
a
painted
label
in
keeping
with
rogues
custom
of
releasing
the
same
beers
under
different
labels
this
example
was
actually
called
rogue
mexicali
ale
i
think
rogue
has
the
right
level
of
heat
here
balancing
almost
perfectly
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
they
use
the
heat
from
the
peppers
is
high
enough
that
its
noticeable
but
not
too
high
that
it
dominates
the
flavor
profile
and
razes
your
taste
buds
not
only
would
it
pair
well
with
mexican
food
but
i
also
think
it
would
do
well
with
some
good
chocolate
yes
i
would
like
another
but
not
too
many
single
bottle
from
peace
street
market
raleigh
note
interesting
flavor
but
i
doubt
ill
revisit
this
style
any
time
soon
i
am
fond
of
hot
sauce
and
tobasco
has
long
since
replaced
ketchup
on
my
scrambled
eggs
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
work
well
with
this
beer
and
the
aftertaste
was
annoying
its
rare
that
i
dont
care
for
a
rogue
beer
but
chile
beer
is
far
from
a
beer
i
can
recommend
maybe
if
drunk
with
a
mexican
meal
it
would
be
complimentary
but
otherwise
its
just
unpleasant
and
funky
this
beer
was
too
acidic
and
the
aftertaste
was
just
plain
rough
not
anything
you
would
want
to
burp
repetitively
i
can
assure
you
i
think
the
adjuncts
of
chiles
added
to
me
feeling
terrible
the
next
day
it
cannot
be
solely
to
blame
due
to
my
indiscretionary
excess
but
it
didnt
help
either
i
might
attempt
this
one
again
with
mexican
cuisine
but
no
time
soon
this
could
be
written
off
as
some
sort
of
novelty
beer
but
i
really
think
the
chipotle
works
excellently
at
accenting
the
pale
aleamber
ale
base
really
reminds
me
of
a
scottish
ale
but
with
a
hint
of
chile
slainte
poured
hazy
amber
with
a
normalabundant
amount
of
head
which
formed
in
some
large
bubbles
aroma
is
very
malty
bready
and
pleasant
previously
id
had
another
chile
beer
which
turned
me
off
from
this
category
so
i
was
a
bit
reluctant
to
take
a
sip
flavor
was
extremely
malty
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
spice
on
the
backend
not
great
but
not
awful
although
i
love
chiles
spicy
food
and
preparing
and
eating
all
the
foods
that
go
with
that
salsa
guacamole
anything
mexican
spicy
tomato
sauces
and
so
on
after
these
two
experiments
with
chile
beers
i
think
im
not
going
to
meddle
with
this
category
further
in
the
future
i
enjoy
it
t
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
ncie
tangy
toothiness
to
it
the
pepper
and
spices
became
very
prevelant
as
the
beer
warmed
up
there
was
some
great
smoky
malt
flavor
to
it
the
beer
had
a
small
bite
but
it
was
there
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
amber
color
with
a
pillowy
light
tan
head
that
fades
into
a
solid
sheet
of
lace
nose
is
sweet
malt
and
smoked
peppers
taste
begins
with
sweet
caramelized
toasted
malt
followed
by
smoky
charcoal
and
a
final
spicy
chipotle
kick
the
heat
is
definitely
noticeable
but
is
not
overpowering
overall
this
brew
incorporates
the
smoky
chili
pepper
flavor
very
well
id
love
to
pair
this
with
some
barbequed
brisket
overall
a
really
interesting
beer
and
probably
better
than
i
expected
and
after
my
tasting
the
rest
of
the
bottle
went
very
well
with
my
barbecue
beef
on
sourdough
da
good
scores
for
the
style
not
exactly
my
favorite
style
so
its
not
as
easy
to
drink
as
some
so
i
decided
to
pick
this
up
after
trying
a
homebrewed
chile
beer
a
week
or
so
ago
and
enjoying
it
in
fact
this
is
a
beer
i
never
thought
i
would
try
it
poured
a
pale
ambermedium
orange
color
into
my
pint
glass
smells
of
sweet
sweet
malts
and
hints
of
smoky
chipotle
peppers
taste
is
more
of
the
same
a
rush
of
sweet
malts
followed
by
a
smoky
chipotle
pepper
taste
at
the
end
not
really
spicy
but
hints
of
spicyness
on
a
110
scale
on
spicyness
id
rate
this
a
0
5
drinkability
actually
isnt
too
bad
on
this
a
nice
addition
for
a
mexican
meal
or
equally
a
decent
predinner
beer
quite
enjoyable
and
recommended
to
all
for
at
the
very
least
a
try
of
something
new
and
different
i
probably
would
have
ranked
it
higher
if
they
had
used
regular
habanero
or
serrano
peppers
instead
of
chipotle
peppers
in
my
opinion
it
would
have
been
better
without
the
smoke
taste
but
thats
just
me
a
decent
beer
and
quite
drinkable
the
chipotle
is
more
of
an
afterthought
its
more
like
a
lightly
smoked
amber
ale
with
a
little
extra
hops
eric
it
tasted
ok
at
firstbut
the
aftertaste
i
didnt
like
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
it
out
of
an
old
shoe
my
friends
also
tasted
it
and
didnt
like
it
either
maybe
it
would
have
tasted
good
with
chips
and
salsa
this
the
only
beer
from
rogue
i
dont
like
taste
starts
with
a
normal
red
ale
toasty
and
biscuity
flavor
then
the
toast
turns
into
smoke
pepper
smoke
a
nice
easy
and
very
palateable
chipotle
aroma
very
interesting
mix
of
a
traditional
amber
ale
with
soem
smokey
and
slighlkty
spicey
peppers
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
burst
of
carbonation
in
each
sip
goes
down
quite
easily
and
i
really
enjoy
the
mix
of
smoky
pepper
flavor
alongside
the
nice
maltiness
of
this
brew
probably
the
best
chili
beer
ive
sampled
yet
doubt
i
could
have
more
than
a
few
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
still
a
nice
change
of
pace
id
say
to
give
this
one
a
try
overall
the
roasted
habanero
taste
is
subdued
enough
for
this
ale
to
be
enjoyable
but
is
otherwise
fairly
boring
tastewise
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
after
reading
the
reviews
here
then
actually
drinking
one
of
these
i
was
expecting
to
have
something
that
would
either
be
pretty
vile
or
pretty
dang
tasty
to
me
since
i
do
like
chilis
and
spicy
food
well
i
did
not
get
either
really
it
pours
a
nice
yellow
with
a
bit
of
a
red
hue
and
a
slightly
white
head
that
laces
pretty
quickly
the
smell
to
me
was
a
bit
like
fermented
fruit
with
just
a
hint
of
smokiness
in
the
background
the
taste
was
what
kind
of
let
me
down
but
not
in
a
horrible
way
it
ended
being
so
average
to
me
i
was
expecting
to
either
be
wowed
or
just
grossed
out
by
something
that
tasted
too
much
like
peppers
i
dont
know
maybe
im
crazy
but
it
just
tasted
like
a
very
average
thin
ale
with
just
a
tiny
hint
of
smokiness
in
the
background
the
immediate
aftertaste
is
just
the
smokiness
but
after
a
while
if
you
let
it
sit
on
your
tongue
i
get
a
hint
of
burnt
chili
seeds
it
was
not
too
bad
for
me
getting
through
the
one
bomber
but
i
gave
it
a
2
5
on
drinkability
because
i
could
definately
imagine
it
turning
off
alot
of
people
and
just
left
me
pretty
unimpressed
either
way
not
horrible
or
anything
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
another
one
i
cracked
open
a
stone
pale
ale
after
drinking
this
one
and
that
just
tasted
soooo
good
after
drinking
this
stuff
drinkability
this
would
be
a
fun
novelty
in
a
12
oz
bottle
in
a
bomber
it
is
a
tough
beer
to
finish
well
i
was
a
little
amazed
that
someone
would
actually
combine
hot
peppers
and
beer
but
i
was
very
happy
with
the
outcome
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
the
smell
of
a
little
pepper
didnt
taste
so
much
like
pepper
but
more
like
a
smokey
bbq
almost
as
if
you
were
drinking
the
smoke
off
of
a
grill
is
the
only
way
i
can
compare
it
definetly
worth
a
try
once
i
felt
like
i
was
eating
some
medium
wings
the
first
sip
is
cool
the
second
sip
you
start
noticing
its
weaknesses
by
the
fifth
sip
im
not
sure
i
can
make
it
through
this
bombersize
bottle
maybe
they
should
sell
this
in
6
oz
bottles
a
novelty
beer
a
novelty
bottle
glad
to
have
had
it
and
i
still
dont
agree
with
the
ultrapurist
beer
drinker
referenced
above
but
no
doubt
neither
one
of
us
are
big
fans
of
this
particular
experiment
overall
this
is
an
interesting
drinking
experience
though
i
cannot
imagine
desiring
much
more
than
one
glass
at
a
sitting
and
even
that
one
glass
proved
a
bit
challenging
to
finish
off
at
the
end
the
pepper
character
strikes
me
as
somewhat
of
a
novelty
and
i
would
just
prefer
a
strong
hop
character
every
time
overall
this
might
be
a
gimmick
but
it
seems
to
work
for
about
the
first
12
of
the
bottle
at
least
best
split
with
someone
else
or
paired
with
very
spicy
food
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
when
i
see
chipotle
ale
i
expect
a
little
bit
more
spice
this
is
nothing
for
me
if
it
were
a
salsa
it
would
be
between
medium
if
you
like
that
then
try
it
taste
is
a
very
interesting
mix
matly
is
the
1st
thing
i
get
then
there
is
the
rest
and
the
rest
is
very
much
a
nice
change
of
pace
no
real
hop
presence
but
the
peppers
are
there
not
in
a
burn
your
mouth
sense
but
more
of
a
pep
a
kick
that
show
up
when
you
least
expect
it
makes
for
a
very
intersting
mix
and
i
recomend
you
try
it
if
you
can
slighty
chew
mouthfeel
and
surprisingly
drinkable
nice
brew
to
get
d
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
one
im
thrilled
with
definitely
an
unusual
experience
and
worth
trrying
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
or
even
an
occassional
basis
jc
grand
rapids
mi
i
dont
understand
how
this
one
left
the
brewery
maybe
its
the
ultimate
in
acquired
taste
but
i
poured
half
of
the
bomber
down
the
sink
such
a
pity
slightly
amber
with
moderate
white
head
that
gives
some
lace
in
my
pilsner
glass
smell
is
peppery
spice
with
malt
backing
it
up
and
even
a
touch
of
smoke
the
taste
is
a
very
refined
and
contained
chile
flavor
the
plays
well
with
the
malt
and
remains
it
the
dry
finish
of
the
beer
i
dug
this
beer
and
it
went
well
with
my
pull
beef
sandwich
drinking
this
by
itself
might
be
much
for
me
but
i
think
this
beer
shines
when
paired
with
food
or
split
in
a
day
of
drinking
oh
wow
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
one
not
knowing
what
to
expect
really
it
poured
a
bit
darker
than
i
was
thinking
it
would
slightly
cloudy
medium
bronze
orange
colour
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
smell
is
mostly
sweet
malts
and
smoke
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
very
little
hot
pepper
presence
only
a
very
slight
tingle
and
thats
kind
of
hit
or
miss
sometimes
its
present
and
sometimes
not
actually
there
is
a
slight
heat
thats
noticeable
many
seconds
after
you
swallow
your
sip
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
very
impressive
for
what
it
is
id
definately
buy
this
again
nice
job
rogue
very
smooth
and
sweet
upfront
followed
by
a
drying
bitter
aspect
from
the
hops
some
heat
sneaks
in
towards
the
end
but
not
nearly
what
i
was
expecting
from
one
of
my
favorite
peppers
no
pepper
qualities
whatsoever
in
the
flavor
which
is
somewhat
of
a
letdown
cheers
pours
an
orangish
red
with
an
off
white
head
that
leave
lacing
the
smell
is
very
smoky
with
some
spicy
notes
the
taste
is
smoky
up
front
not
as
much
as
rogues
smoked
ale
with
a
dry
finish
that
leaves
the
spice
of
the
chipotle
lingering
in
your
mouth
this
is
a
meduim
bodied
brew
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
balance
the
taste
is
not
very
overpowering
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
cannot
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
couple
of
these
i
would
suggest
drinking
these
along
with
a
nice
bbq
or
the
flavor
could
get
old
a
very
interesting
brew
done
very
well
this
is
worth
checking
out
especially
if
you
like
rogues
smoked
ale
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
a
testament
to
craft
brewers
innovation
wow
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
picked
it
up
out
of
the
curiosity
of
possibly
using
chipotle
in
my
own
homebrew
and
wanted
to
see
how
the
pros
at
rogue
managed
i
was
immediately
struck
by
the
sweet
hot
smokey
smell
of
chipotle
chiles
it
was
a
carbon
copy
of
opening
a
bag
of
actual
chipotle
chiles
having
heard
horror
stories
of
other
chile
beers
i
was
a
little
worried
i
poured
the
beer
a
burnt
umber
into
a
pint
glass
with
no
head
carbonation
was
there
just
not
in
the
form
of
any
amount
of
head
in
fact
it
tickled
my
tonge
with
the
carbonation
and
the
lack
of
head
did
not
help
the
mouthfeel
the
real
surprise
came
in
the
first
sip
absolutely
a
chipotle
beer
i
could
taste
smoky
jalapenos
complete
with
spicy
aftertaste
i
even
noted
a
bit
of
a
hop
presence
but
the
more
notable
offsetting
flavor
was
a
carmel
sweetness
in
the
malts
it
balanced
the
spicysmoky
chipotle
nicely
i
had
a
hard
time
drinking
a
lot
of
this
at
once
due
to
the
spicinessi
felt
like
too
much
of
it
would
give
me
heartburn
therefore
i
spaced
it
out
over
a
period
of
grilling
veggies
eating
dinner
and
cleaning
up
it
actually
went
fantastically
with
my
grilled
veggie
sandwich
i
marinated
some
portabellos
zuccini
and
red
pepper
in
olive
oil
and
balsamic
vinegar
and
grilled
them
i
toasted
the
bread
and
spread
hummos
on
both
sides
the
result
matched
the
chipotle
ale
perfectly
meaty
portabellos
worked
with
the
smoky
beer
tangy
hummos
offset
the
spiciness
the
sweet
red
peppers
picked
up
the
sweetness
in
the
malts
the
zuccini
well
fortunatly
there
was
not
a
vegetable
taste
in
the
beer
so
that
was
just
extra
i
probably
would
not
buy
another
one
of
these
unless
matching
it
with
food
chipotle
beer
with
veggies
who
would
have
thought
d
interesting
beer
would
go
very
good
with
a
good
cheese
drinkability
very
nice
i
like
it
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
the
pepper
is
definitely
noticable
yet
not
enough
to
put
me
off
of
the
brew
ill
buy
it
again
taste
is
a
biscuity
malt
you
can
even
taste
some
hops
the
pepper
flavor
is
light
enough
to
just
balance
with
the
malt
jalepeno
spice
almost
acts
as
the
hops
in
this
beer
mouth
is
long
and
sticky
not
a
bad
invention
sort
of
a
novelty
rauchbier
but
its
honestly
exactly
what
it
claims
to
be
it
is
a
chipoltle
flavored
ale
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
it
might
be
interesting
if
they
could
offer
this
beer
with
varying
heat
levels
like
salsa
mild
medium
etc
but
beyond
pretty
good
although
i
cant
see
myself
ever
buying
this
again
except
for
its
novelty
this
was
a
pretty
goodlooking
beer
cloudy
amber
with
a
medium
sized
head
aroma
was
alelike
with
some
pepper
spiciness
i
honestly
cannot
tell
whether
it
was
chipotle
or
some
other
pepper
taste
was
hoppy
with
some
warming
spiciness
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
i
think
this
is
a
beer
one
would
try
as
a
curiosity
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
distinctly
orange
hue
and
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
lasts
reasonably
well
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
smoky
with
a
dark
fruitiness
and
just
a
hint
of
hot
peppers
taste
is
once
again
dominated
by
a
smoky
note
which
ive
never
been
fond
of
its
probably
because
being
from
an
atlantic
province
its
a
smell
and
taste
indelibly
associated
with
fish
for
me
at
any
rate
other
flavours
include
breads
and
plum
and
the
finish
is
dominated
by
the
heat
of
the
peppers
which
try
valiantly
to
save
this
beer
for
me
but
ultimately
come
up
short
not
bad
in
its
way
but
not
up
my
alley
at
all
the
aroma
smells
a
bit
spicyand
somewhat
smoky
a
little
like
a
taco
salsa
it
also
smells
like
a
typical
ale
until
you
get
further
down
the
glass
the
taste
is
pretty
hoppy
and
blended
well
with
some
malts
it
is
followed
by
a
definite
hot
spiciness
along
with
more
hop
bitterness
it
leaves
a
spicy
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
just
like
a
mild
salsa
the
spiciness
is
actually
warming
this
is
definitely
different
but
not
one
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
i
remember
having
this
beer
several
years
ago
at
rogues
brewery
before
id
ever
had
smoked
beers
i
thought
it
was
awful
having
expanded
my
palate
id
say
this
is
a
fine
beer
its
not
as
smoky
as
rogues
smoke
ale
and
far
less
smoky
than
rauchbiers
but
if
you
like
a
tiny
bit
of
chile
spice
you
should
give
this
beer
a
try
quite
different
i
must
say
but
i
dont
try
a
lot
of
hot
pepper
beers
so
thats
probably
to
be
expected
an
interesting
brew
that
would
be
a
great
unique
one
to
pair
with
mexican
food
md
the
ale
is
medium
bodied
medium
to
low
carbonation
it
is
an
interesting
beer
and
as
i
sit
here
with
it
i
can
really
appreciate
it
but
it
is
definitely
not
something
that
i
would
drink
very
often
i
has
taken
me
a
really
long
time
to
finish
this
bomber
its
a
slow
drinker
nice
head
that
didnt
hang
around
leaving
ok
lacing
a
smokey
nose
a
huge
smokey
flavor
with
the
slight
bite
coming
through
at
the
end
i
expected
a
heavier
mouthfeel
and
i
thought
it
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
overall
a
really
interesting
beer
and
i
recommend
that
you
try
it
i
couldnt
finish
what
i
had
been
given
i
found
the
taste
too
overwhelming
to
drink
a
pint
of
it
but
i
liked
it
i
am
thinking
of
using
it
in
recipes
maybe
in
my
beer
cheese
soup
or
maybe
in
place
of
a
stout
in
gravy
overall
this
is
wonderfully
balanced
a
wonderful
brewing
feat
when
it
would
be
oh
so
easy
to
screw
a
beer
like
this
up
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
sounds
like
a
bad
idea
but
turns
out
wonderfully
which
is
true
to
rogue
brewing
history
actually
very
easy
to
drink
but
a
bomber
is
going
to
be
enough
for
me
i
would
get
this
again
for
sure
and
would
recommend
you
try
it
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
in
the
end
theres
definitely
chiles
yes
but
its
also
leathery
as
well
i
havent
come
across
that
sort
of
flavour
since
a
few
fish
tales
beers
i
had
sampled
before
a
mighty
fine
ale
all
things
considered
they
did
an
excellent
job
the
craftsmanship
is
there
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
other
brewed
beverage
a
sipping
beer
definitely
and
would
go
great
paired
with
red
meat
off
the
grill
or
really
with
anything
that
involves
salsa
id
save
this
stuff
more
for
autumn
and
winter
days
as
well
not
something
id
grab
to
quench
on
a
hot
day
the
rogue
chipolte
ale
is
a
very
interesting
brew
containing
smoke
and
fire
this
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
though
short
lasting
head
the
smell
is
smokey
with
malts
and
hops
barely
poking
through
the
taste
is
smokey
and
then
there
is
a
nice
follow
up
of
spice
this
is
a
fun
brew
i
can
foresee
enjoying
this
with
just
about
any
spicey
texmex
dish
it
would
fit
in
nicely
drinkability
is
isa
bit
limited
at
least
for
me
to
a
bomber
per
sitting
plus
i
would
only
enjoy
this
on
occassion
dont
be
afraid
it
is
different
but
good
this
beer
pours
a
rusty
amber
color
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
that
holds
and
laces
nicely
it
smells
malty
with
a
strong
smoky
and
spicy
aroma
overall
it
has
a
strong
smoked
chili
flavor
balanced
nicely
with
malts
and
hops
it
also
has
a
good
mouthfeel
nicely
thick
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
all
night
its
a
pretty
intense
flavor
i
will
have
this
again
cheers
m
d
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
looks
great
i
found
that
although
i
like
spicy
foods
and
chipolte
in
food
and
sauces
this
one
was
a
bit
too
far
down
the
smoked
pepper
trail
for
me
i
didnt
quite
make
it
through
half
the
bottle
i
think
its
worth
an
experience
just
to
taste
the
blend
of
smoke
and
pepper
but
for
me
a
12oz
bottle
would
be
plenty
at
a
sitting
like
the
other
rogue
beers
i
have
sampled
this
looks
very
good
in
the
glass
with
a
rich
ambermaple
syrup
colour
and
a
creamcoloured
head
that
is
tight
and
left
good
lacing
really
lovely
colour
straddling
that
wonderful
hue
between
ruby
red
and
rosewood
brown
the
chipotle
peppers
are
definitely
there
as
i
first
smell
above
the
glass
which
almost
seem
to
emulate
hops
in
their
aroma
this
smells
almost
tequilalike
at
times
definitely
spicy
with
good
full
authentic
chipotle
notes
along
with
nice
caramel
malt
and
fairly
assertive
hopping
actually
very
balanced
with
just
enough
of
the
chipotle
even
without
the
peppers
this
would
be
a
fine
pale
ale
it
really
does
remind
me
of
some
chipotle
dishes
i
have
had
dry
and
a
little
astringent
malting
adds
some
caramel
and
light
raisins
and
cream
and
bread
taste
showcases
the
peppers
very
expertly
with
a
very
good
balance
here
it
starts
with
dark
malts
and
then
in
the
middle
really
lets
the
pepper
shine
through
and
by
the
finish
you
get
that
spicy
tang
that
burns
the
lips
and
tongue
a
bit
as
if
you
have
just
eaten
a
chipotle
pepper
everything
just
works
somehow
the
taste
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
is
fantastic
and
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
dry
peppery
feeling
i
have
to
rate
it
high
not
so
much
because
i
find
it
overly
tasty
but
because
of
the
way
they
mixed
the
peppers
with
the
beer
fantastic
execution
it
seems
to
warm
the
throat
and
belly
in
a
that
way
only
peppers
do
the
taste
is
not
extremely
complex
beyond
the
light
roasty
malting
and
the
peppers
but
the
finish
does
leave
some
nice
hoppy
bitterness
as
well
wow
this
was
pulled
off
very
well
good
moderaly
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
full
bodied
a
piquant
beer
but
also
relatively
drinkable
the
pepper
is
never
overthetop
but
neither
is
this
a
case
of
searching
for
some
hidden
flavour
that
leaves
you
wondering
if
this
was
just
a
misnamed
pale
ale
an
admirable
beer
and
i
was
rather
impressed
would
be
fun
to
pair
with
mexican
or
indian
dishes
this
could
stand
up
to
repeated
drinking
toonot
just
a
novelty
onetime
glad
i
tried
it
beer
this
didnt
pair
very
well
with
the
chile
con
queso
i
had
except
the
spices
it
kept
my
mouth
ablaze
which
i
love
but
the
smoked
flavor
was
dominating
too
much
might
go
better
with
a
meat
dish
of
some
sort
but
i
would
never
know
alone
its
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
offering
unique
and
worth
a
try
once
in
awhile
just
not
very
drinkable
in
quantities
this
is
a
wierd
brew
the
beer
poured
with
little
head
and
it
is
the
color
of
sweet
tea
the
smell
is
not
too
bad
similar
to
a
light
beer
with
some
spices
the
taste
is
hard
to
describe
it
starts
out
as
a
dull
spiced
taste
then
it
turns
into
a
lasting
bittersweetness
with
small
hints
of
peppers
the
mouthfeel
is
not
too
bad
there
is
no
harshness
just
the
weird
lingering
aftertaste
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
try
again
probably
not
too
bad
when
reveiwed
within
the
style
but
i
dont
think
i
will
try
this
style
again
either
poured
into
a
tumbler
as
recommended
this
beer
looked
to
be
somewhere
between
light
brown
and
orange
in
color
and
had
a
smallish
foamy
head
while
it
looked
pretty
good
it
did
not
exude
much
smell
at
all
i
could
detect
a
faint
smokiness
but
nothing
else
when
consumed
the
beer
clearly
oozed
the
mild
smoky
taste
of
chipotle
peppers
this
was
balanced
well
by
the
sweet
fruitiness
of
the
caramel
malt
and
some
well
chosen
citric
hops
from
the
pacific
northwest
pretty
similar
in
flavor
to
chasing
mexican
food
down
with
an
american
pale
ale
which
happens
to
be
a
pretty
good
beer
and
food
pairing
combination
in
my
opinion
the
flavors
worked
well
together
and
the
aftertaste
was
densely
smoky
quite
juicy
and
medium
thick
on
the
palette
this
would
work
splendidly
well
as
an
aperitif
overall
a
much
better
beer
than
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
frankly
i
didnt
expect
a
chili
beer
to
be
so
balanced
i
would
never
drink
this
as
a
daily
weekly
is
out
of
the
question
and
yearly
yeah
maybe
not
for
me
fellas
im
convinced
this
will
sell
well
with
certain
demos
but
it
misses
me
alltogether
pours
an
amber
color
with
plumes
of
frothy
bubbly
head
gorgeous
very
earthy
smelling
not
so
much
smokey
but
the
chilies
are
present
c
hops
and
malt
provide
a
nice
backbone
this
is
some
interesting
stuff
flavors
are
at
first
very
typical
amber
ale
like
then
the
smokey
chili
flavors
dominate
this
is
close
to
a
smoked
beer
but
it
has
more
of
the
chipotle
flavor
to
it
not
a
smoked
malt
flavor
a
little
spiciness
lingers
in
the
mouth
this
would
be
perfect
with
chocolate
overall
i
have
to
say
this
beer
met
my
expectation
of
both
weird
and
delicious
the
bomber
is
certainly
drinkable
but
beyond
that
forget
it
ill
grab
an
ipa
fast
over
this
well
done
cheers
pours
an
intense
crimsonamber
with
a
nice
beige
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
malty
with
toasted
bread
and
caramel
some
spicy
and
floral
hops
and
a
mild
smokey
pepper
scent
the
flavor
is
subtle
but
complex
with
some
toasted
bread
and
biscuit
spicy
and
floral
hops
and
complex
smokeiness
as
well
as
roasted
chipotle
pepper
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
good
a
very
nice
chile
beer
complex
and
tasty
im
not
sure
how
typical
this
beer
is
for
the
style
while
i
was
expecting
a
crisp
spicy
pale
ale
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
smoky
roasted
taste
overall
i
liked
this
beer
better
than
the
jalapeño
sunsplash
that
i
had
at
the
extreme
beer
fest
the
base
beer
was
nicer
though
in
the
end
the
smokiness
was
too
much
and
the
spiciness
could
have
been
raised
it
actually
pairs
quite
well
the
smokiness
is
subdued
by
the
red
chile
broth
but
still
retains
its
complexity
and
it
remains
an
almost
quenching
retreat
from
the
heat
of
the
dish
in
fact
i
would
say
that
where
this
beer
really
excels
is
in
its
pairing
with
spicy
mexican
food
ill
certainly
try
it
with
all
sorts
of
dishes
rogues
chipotle
ale
is
interesting
the
chipotle
can
be
overpowering
but
if
you
are
a
lover
of
peppers
then
this
is
a
winner
this
beer
is
not
my
favorite
offering
from
rogue
but
they
do
have
many
more
beers
to
offer
mediocre
in
my
book
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
i
cant
pick
up
any
spices
but
nonetheless
a
pleasant
smell
it
has
a
very
subtle
spice
with
a
malty
sweetness
leaves
a
spicy
warmness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
almost
no
carbonation
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
after
my
first
glass
i
started
to
feel
the
spice
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
but
i
had
a
25oz
bottle
so
i
didnt
have
much
choice
i
will
say
that
i
was
hoping
for
something
with
a
little
more
spice
this
is
a
very
subtle
the
first
thing
my
wife
and
i
both
thought
was
how
to
pair
this
with
food
as
this
seems
a
good
choice
for
a
broad
range
of
meals
its
not
an
everyday
beer
nor
is
this
a
big
beer
especially
served
as
we
did
it
right
after
the
imperial
ipa
what
were
we
thinking
but
a
solid
experience
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
to
repeat
try
it
if
youre
curious
its
not
that
out
there
very
drinkable
i
liken
it
to
a
rauchbier
as
well
very
similar
in
taste
aroma
and
mouthfeel
its
easier
to
drink
too
i
will
go
back
for
more
this
has
a
nice
dark
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
very
nice
sweet
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
good
it
is
sweet
spicy
and
smokey
almost
like
a
scottish
ale
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
but
not
a
typical
hop
bitterness
the
smoke
flavor
is
noticeable
but
not
overbearing
my
mouth
kind
of
feels
like
i
was
drinking
a
good
beer
and
smoking
a
good
cigar
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
very
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
good
a
drinkable
fun
brew
to
behold
if
in
the
mood
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
perfectly
spiced
and
smokey
for
this
northern
boys
buds
a
cool
concept
for
beer
but
it
just
didnt
really
taste
much
like
peppers
or
have
any
kick
to
it
at
all
a
very
thin
and
quiet
brew
the
peppers
are
the
whole
story
here
its
just
not
a
brew
to
savor
its
more
of
a
hurry
up
and
finish
it
frosty
i
think
you
really
need
to
be
working
on
some
bbq
to
fully
enjoy
it
there
are
probably
others
like
me
who
fear
spending
the
4
50
on
a
bottle
of
chipolte
ale
after
trying
something
like
cave
creek
but
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
rogue
is
a
great
brewer
and
they
have
made
a
winner
with
this
beer
the
peppers
compliment
the
rest
of
the
beer
well
and
its
a
nice
change
from
your
average
beer
i
recommend
it
and
will
certianly
be
picking
this
up
again
maybe
in
just
a
few
minutes
d
good
for
a
reminder
of
the
summer
to
come
or
for
a
summer
evening
outdoors
including
peppers
works
well
in
this
case
and
rogue
deserves
credit
for
trying
this
out
and
succeeding
with
it
the
spiciness
in
beer
is
interesting
and
quite
enjoyable
im
actually
really
glad
i
tried
this
one
i
admittedly
just
wanted
it
for
the
bottle
i
think
rogue
managed
to
do
a
pepper
beer
the
right
way
this
stuff
is
awesome
i
wish
i
could
have
one
of
these
every
time
i
have
mexican
food
drinkability
there
arent
many
pepper
beers
to
contend
with
but
this
is
my
favorite
one
great
grillfood
beer
had
this
unusual
beer
at
the
rogue
fest
in
december
2005
at
summits
wayside
tavern
in
sandy
springs
ga
they
somehow
have
close
ties
with
rogue
brewery
and
get
unusual
kegs
i
was
skeptical
about
this
one
and
avoided
it
on
a
few
trips
i
do
love
chipotle
sauce
and
beer
but
didnt
know
about
combining
them
poured
like
standard
ale
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
little
bit
of
quickly
disappearing
head
the
smell
is
of
beer
and
yep
chipotle
sauce
smells
pleasant
like
a
backyard
bbq
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
flat
the
taste
was
ok
mildly
hoppy
ale
with
a
heavy
chipotle
finish
it
grew
on
me
a
bit
as
i
drank
it
but
cant
say
i
would
have
another
its
a
novelty
though
glad
i
tried
it
a
clean
dark
amber
beer
with
orange
hightlights
has
a
big
foamy
off
white
head
aroma
ok
smoked
chille
peppers
and
just
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
in
the
background
but
mostly
smoked
chille
peppers
taste
ok
this
has
got
to
be
on
of
the
best
tasteing
chile
beers
i
hav
had
yet
a
great
smooth
smoky
character
at
first
then
a
little
malty
sweetness
with
a
spicey
hop
finish
and
then
in
true
chipolte
fashion
a
slow
building
pepper
burn
yum
a
medium
body
with
very
light
heat
from
the
peppers
barley
noticeable
to
a
capsaicin
addict
like
me
not
overly
hoppy
for
a
rogue
either
id
say
its
safe
for
the
masses
to
try
not
to
spicy
not
to
hoppy
not
too
much
of
anything
really
i
expected
more
though
d
i
appreciated
the
smoke
and
pepper
where
nicely
integrated
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
unlike
so
many
rauch
beers
and
pepper
beers
that
being
said
it
was
only
an
average
beer
interesting
stuff
not
for
everyday
drinking
but
still
a
nice
solid
ale
with
a
touch
of
hot
peppers
ooh
let
me
go
get
some
pepper
jack
sweeeet
do
you
like
peppers
if
so
youll
probably
like
this
slàinte
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
beer
for
me
and
though
i
feel
that
this
must
be
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
to
think
the
style
is
not
for
me
try
it
and
find
out
for
yourself
moderate
mouth
that
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
my
only
regret
is
that
i
didnt
pair
this
with
chicken
fajitas
or
jalepeno
jack
next
time
this
brew
pours
a
murky
amber
color
the
head
is
nonexistant
and
there
is
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
peppers
in
the
background
the
taste
is
mildy
sweet
with
chile
peppers
mildly
coming
through
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
brew
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
i
had
thought
it
would
be
i
am
glad
that
it
is
rather
mellow
and
certainly
not
in
my
face
i
just
noticed
that
it
was
a
spring
seasonal
so
ill
have
to
try
this
again
when
it
is
fresh
i
bet
the
chipotle
will
be
much
more
noticeable
it
still
holds
up
as
a
decent
ale
with
a
very
subtle
pepper
flavor
notes
interesting
and
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
repeating
i
really
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
chile
beer
after
cave
creek
ruined
my
sense
of
adventure
in
that
direction
for
quite
some
time
but
what
stands
out
is
how
real
the
pepper
becomes
as
you
drink
its
a
pretty
wild
diversion
the
way
it
presents
something
new
and
unusual
to
the
palate
it
is
reasonably
drinkable
but
thats
mitigated
by
the
character
that
gives
it
an
almost
novelty
status
its
not
destined
to
become
a
favorite
but
it
does
go
to
show
that
most
things
in
life
are
worth
trying
at
least
one
time
this
is
my
first
chile
beer
it
is
probably
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
dont
care
for
it
much
amber
red
color
no
head
or
carbonation
some
mild
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
up
front
it
smells
and
tastes
like
a
nice
malty
ale
but
the
chile
aftertaste
and
finish
is
just
too
overwhelming
its
disappointing
because
it
seems
like
it
would
be
better
if
it
was
a
little
milder
on
the
chiles
i
had
to
try
this
novelty
beer
i
will
not
buy
another
one
drinkability
fun
to
drink
the
flavor
makes
it
something
that
shouldnt
be
chugged
but
it
wont
weigh
you
down
or
overwhelm
you
my
first
encounter
with
a
chile
beer
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
actually
enjoyed
it
maybe
its
because
its
by
a
quality
brewer
but
this
one
did
not
scare
me
away
from
the
style
completely
a
very
astringent
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
tough
to
finish
overall
very
unimpressed
definitely
needs
more
pepper
or
jalapeno
flavor
and
maybe
more
malts
to
balance
out
that
spicy
pepper
flavor
perhaps
i
dont
understand
the
style
but
this
beer
really
didnt
take
to
me
thick
dense
head
on
top
of
a
dark
amber
crystaline
body
smelled
lightly
of
peppers
and
timber
ash
pleasant
on
the
cool
evening
it
tastes
vaguely
of
chili
paste
or
spoiled
almonds
kinda
a
numbing
sensation
left
no
discernable
aftertaste
but
was
hard
enough
to
take
down
felt
about
right
but
not
drinkable
as
its
taste
was
a
bit
too
chili
for
me
chile
beer
tends
to
be
polarizing
looking
at
some
of
the
scores
chipotle
ale
is
no
different
on
this
one
however
i
find
myself
gravitating
toward
some
middle
ground
i
think
i
want
more
of
a
chipotle
presence
but
im
not
sure
if
id
like
the
beer
that
im
suggesting
they
brew
if
anyone
out
there
is
worried
about
overwhelming
roasted
pepper
flavor
and
mouth
numbing
heat
dont
be
this
is
a
relatively
tame
chile
beer
and
in
the
end
is
an
enjoyable
one
no
freshness
date
litle
head
and
nice
brownred
foggy
beer
nose
is
good
giving
good
chops
good
full
maltyness
and
and
overal
fresh
and
fruity
nose
taste
is
dry
full
malty
citrussy
before
bitterness
and
the
chile
take
overal
something
new
to
me
but
certainly
not
bad
after
drinking
longer
this
hanging
chile
taste
comes
in
your
mouth
giving
it
an
extra
dimention
in
moutfeel
that
misses
imo
some
body
good
brew
though
thats
easy
drinkable
and
certainly
something
else
this
thing
tastes
like
biting
into
a
hickory
twig
in
a
good
way
i
has
a
very
obvious
smoke
flavor
thats
kind
of
shocking
at
first
but
after
a
few
seconds
i
started
to
realize
how
good
it
was
smooth
and
delicious
and
it
tastes
like
smoke
this
beer
would
be
absolutely
perfect
with
a
steak
or
sitting
around
the
campfire
i
really
like
this
and
will
buy
again
price
was
a
little
steep
though
it
tastes
like
beer
and
chipotle
should
but
its
missing
the
spice
it
shows
up
just
as
im
finishing
the
bottle
and
i
dont
even
drink
fast
youve
got
to
take
into
acount
that
alcohol
numbs
your
taste
buds
to
capsacian
and
that
i
like
thai
food
i
hadnt
tasted
any
spice
throughout
the
whole
bottle
and
even
forgot
there
was
supposed
to
be
any
and
when
it
showed
up
i
was
like
oh
right
this
has
a
nice
dark
amber
colorbut
the
head
was
a
little
smallone
fingerthan
other
rogues
the
smell
is
a
very
earthywith
a
little
spice
the
taste
is
very
different
i
dont
think
ive
ever
tasted
a
beer
so
smokey
you
can
really
taste
the
chipolteit
has
a
slight
bite
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
this
has
a
somewhat
lightmedium
feelpretty
drinkable
this
isnt
rogues
best
alebut
i
admire
them
for
trying
different
things
i
would
try
this
again
this
lightly
spicy
heavily
smoky
beer
makes
a
unique
session
brew
with
not
too
much
spiciness
it
is
suprisingly
drinkable
rather
than
a
novelty
and
the
smoky
chipotles
give
it
enough
of
a
unique
kick
to
keep
it
interesting
all
night
there
is
a
certain
medicinal
quality
to
the
smoky
flavor
that
is
noticable
in
the
odor
and
taste
and
it
is
a
little
too
overpowering
to
make
this
a
perfect
beer
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
boasts
of
a
nice
crispness
without
a
overly
filling
mouthfeel
and
a
seemingly
low
alcohol
content
i
couldnt
find
the
abv
for
this
one
anywhere
which
combined
with
the
taste
make
it
a
pretty
drinkable
ale
a
good
beer
for
this
category
and
i
would
return
to
it
if
the
moment
or
the
desire
strikes
theres
a
small
creamcolored
sticky
still
head
the
beer
is
a
clear
rusty
copper
swoopy
lacing
nose
is
smoky
with
a
little
fruit
and
a
touch
of
chocolatey
malt
smoky
milky
front
leads
to
a
big
milky
malty
sweetish
thick
middle
the
finish
is
lightly
spicy
smoky
nutty
and
bitter
some
nice
citrusy
hops
poke
through
wow
very
tasty
a
meal
in
a
bottle
quite
smoky
and
milky
only
subtly
spicy
with
enough
malt
spine
to
support
it
really
really
tasty
light
to
medium
in
body
smooth
and
mildly
crisp
at
the
start
and
finishes
smooth
and
smokey
i
sampled
and
reviewed
this
before
my
meal
and
then
during
my
meal
of
spicy
tacos
and
refried
beans
the
drinkability
alone
is
very
average
and
with
some
spicy
food
was
also
average
this
may
pair
a
little
better
with
some
spicy
bbq
ribs
because
of
the
soft
smokiness
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
bright
amber
color
with
a
small
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
smoke
aroma
hot
peppers
followed
by
smoke
and
wood
flavors
i
can
feel
the
heat
after
the
first
sip
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
has
a
lasting
spicy
pepper
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
clean
easy
to
drink
the
chiles
lend
a
nice
earthiness
but
it
would
be
hard
to
characterize
this
alongside
other
chile
beers
a
good
choice
with
the
chipotles
but
you
could
double
or
triple
the
amount
chipotles
are
among
the
mildest
peppers
and
get
a
much
better
beer
oh
man
this
beer
is
awsome
not
the
killer
hops
like
most
of
the
rougs
ive
tried
but
no
matter
pours
a
nice
deep
ruby
color
on
first
smell
i
dont
really
smell
to
much
spice
but
its
there
malty
goodness
theres
some
pretty
good
lacing
in
the
glass
but
then
its
rogue
so
you
really
know
there
are
peppers
in
here
after
you
have
drank
the
beer
you
can
feel
that
tingling
sensation
on
the
tip
of
your
tounge
like
you
just
ate
some
spicy
food
a
great
beer
these
beers
are
always
an
exciting
yet
apprehensive
experiment
both
for
the
brewers
and
the
drinkers
bright
copper
colored
with
some
distinguishable
amber
highlights
quite
carbonated
with
a
dainty
head
that
fades
quick
lacing
is
impressive
though
the
aromas
are
somewhat
of
a
bloody
mary
with
the
spiciness
pepperyness
and
vegetable
characters
tastes
is
similar
as
well
throw
in
sweet
barley
malt
earthy
hops
smoked
vegetables
and
clean
ale
yeast
mild
barley
sweetness
and
celerylike
vegetables
up
front
then
chile
and
hop
spiciness
hit
in
the
body
chile
heat
is
assertive
but
not
over
kill
the
beer
tapers
into
a
dry
chile
vegetable
flavor
not
bad
ive
had
worse
drinkable
as
all
hell
to
me
this
is
the
ultimate
barbecue
or
texmex
beer
or
i
would
drink
it
anytime
i
am
a
major
chilie
head
neat
cool
a
beer
with
chipotle
peppers
in
it
i
wont
be
racing
to
track
another
down
this
beer
struck
me
as
having
a
somewhat
oily
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
the
beer
was
semilow
on
the
drinkability
scale
for
me
only
because
this
beer
is
not
my
bag
a
12oz
sample
would
have
sufficed
for
me
very
unique
and
worth
a
try
thanks
to
andrea
for
this
gift
smack
opinion
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
is
clean
and
well
made
to
showcase
the
spice
addition
i
am
not
sure
at
what
point
the
chipotle
peppers
were
added
to
the
mix
but
it
would
be
nice
if
they
were
more
present
in
the
aroma
and
added
more
fresh
flavor
about
half
way
through
this
beer
i
got
some
relief
as
warming
peppers
finally
overwhelmed
the
impression
that
i
was
drinking
beer
out
of
a
box
of
bandaids
not
what
i
expected
from
rogue
a
lot
more
drinkabe
than
cave
creeks
but
the
flavors
dont
meld
and
like
crazy
eds
it
seems
to
only
be
a
novelty
brew
drinkability
the
only
time
i
would
have
this
again
is
with
maybe
with
some
mexican
food
this
would
probably
be
an
excellent
pairing
not
my
kinda
style
but
blows
away
crazy
eds
by
about
a
millionfold
smooth
fairly
easy
to
drink
with
the
heat
almost
like
an
afterthought
that
lingers
on
pleasantly
this
should
be
a
great
accompniement
to
texmex
or
southwestern
cuisine
the
chipotle
is
mild
enough
to
complement
spicy
food
rather
than
compete
with
it
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
impression
a
good
smoked
beer
not
really
a
pepper
beer
in
my
mind
just
a
sweet
smoky
great
beer
i
get
tingles
of
heat
in
my
lips
and
in
my
chest
the
heat
is
at
a
great
level
where
its
felt
but
doesnt
hurt
purchased
7905
at
made
in
oregon
shop
in
portland
international
airport
i
was
expecting
something
like
cave
creek
a
pilsner
lager
with
a
chili
taste
first
pour
reveals
something
much
darker
burnt
orange
in
color
little
or
no
head
retention
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
and
a
slightly
smokey
aroma
first
sip
reveals
more
a
rauchbier
flavor
slight
bitterness
a
slight
hint
of
heat
on
the
tongue
but
very
slight
more
bitterness
than
a
rauchbier
like
a
rauchbier
on
hops
not
as
exotic
i
would
have
thought
based
on
the
ingredients
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
1
finger
head
and
good
lacing
i
dont
get
too
much
nose
on
this
one
but
i
do
get
some
smoke
and
malt
aromas
taste
is
similar
in
start
to
their
smoked
ale
but
you
dont
get
the
ham
flavor
instead
it
is
of
very
mild
pepper
not
spicy
at
all
very
nicely
balanced
between
malt
hops
and
smokiness
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
the
complete
opposite
of
cave
creek
ickyuk
typical
rogue
bomber
pours
rich
orangy
amber
fairly
cloudy
slight
tan
head
leaves
moderate
lacing
nose
is
fairly
mild
i
get
hints
of
smoke
red
peppers
and
malty
sweetness
medium
bodied
lots
of
smoke
red
pepper
and
a
mild
jalapeno
note
not
overpowering
but
the
pepperchili
thing
is
present
nicely
balanced
by
malt
sweetness
not
for
everybody
but
pepper
heads
will
love
it
great
selection
for
texmex
type
food
drinkability
very
good
very
tasty
and
original
its
smooth
and
well
done
i
really
like
the
roasted
pepper
taste
in
here
d
this
is
a
very
pleasant
chile
beer
im
quite
surprised
who
good
it
is
i
thought
all
chile
beers
had
to
involve
pain
but
this
one
is
all
pleasure
as
a
fan
of
spicey
food
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
my
first
chipotle
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
away
pretty
fast
nose
is
pretty
much
like
a
normal
alecaramel
malts
floral
hoppiness
and
just
a
hint
of
smokiness
first
taste
is
full
of
smokey
chipotle
flavor
very
tasty
not
at
all
burning
and
integrating
well
with
the
malty
backbone
of
the
beer
after
a
few
sips
a
spicey
heat
can
be
felt
on
the
tongue
between
sips
and
this
spiciness
builds
throughout
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
i
had
this
beer
with
some
nachos
cheese
and
salsa
and
it
really
provided
an
excellent
match
to
the
food
however
due
to
the
onedimensional
spiciness
of
this
beer
im
not
sure
id
ever
drink
this
by
itself
i
had
doubts
about
how
good
this
style
of
beer
could
be
but
as
usual
rogue
puts
out
an
exemplary
product
at
least
he
let
me
get
something
else
my
first
chili
ale
i
assumed
this
would
be
an
interesting
concoction
the
color
is
a
hazy
copper
with
good
carbonation
and
creamy
head
the
aroma
consists
of
a
mild
malty
sweetness
joined
by
a
stronger
element
of
the
spicy
and
somewhat
smokey
chipotle
the
taste
is
very
interesting
and
complex
a
sip
starts
with
a
standard
mild
malt
flavor
but
is
soon
joined
by
spiciness
and
mild
smokiness
moderately
citrusy
hops
provide
a
nice
bite
you
can
definently
tastes
the
peppers
but
the
flavor
isnt
overwelmingly
spicy
the
highlight
of
this
brew
is
the
interplay
between
the
malts
and
the
chipotle
towards
the
middle
of
a
sip
a
crisp
mouthfeel
is
also
welcomed
despite
enjoying
the
interesting
flavor
of
this
beer
i
did
get
a
little
tired
of
the
chili
flavor
by
the
end
of
my
22
oz
bottle
only
one
of
these
every
now
and
then
would
suit
me
fine
it
seems
like
it
probably
loses
something
due
to
simplicity
and
on
its
own
its
a
bit
eh
but
it
would
certainly
hold
its
own
as
a
texmex
wash
fairly
drinkable
brew
i
had
it
with
some
chipotle
burrito
and
was
set
for
the
night
i
really
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
though
a
really
weird
beer
but
something
strangely
enjoyable
pours
a
light
brownish
orange
with
no
real
head
a
slight
bit
of
pepper
in
the
nose
but
not
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
the
taste
is
very
satisfying
with
a
malty
sweetness
up
front
but
a
whole
lot
of
peppery
spiciness
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
really
hits
the
roof
of
your
mouth
this
dry
smoky
hotness
a
real
refreshing
and
smooth
beer
but
with
a
limited
drinkability
first
let
me
state
that
im
not
a
hot
pepper
fan
but
the
chipotles
light
involvement
is
just
about
right
for
my
taste
i
cant
say
that
ill
return
to
this
category
of
beers
based
on
my
general
respect
for
my
taste
buds
but
it
certainly
was
worth
a
look
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
spicey
red
chile
edge
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
very
spicey
chipotle
pepper
taste
i
love
these
kind
of
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
considering
its
a
pepper
beer
rogue
seems
to
be
able
to
get
it
done
no
matter
what
style
it
is
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
hearty
almost
chewy
mouthfeel
and
tiny
trickling
carbonation
that
is
a
perfect
delivery
vehicle
for
the
subtle
heat
of
the
chipotles
this
would
be
awesome
with
some
smoked
pulled
pork
i
guess
going
into
this
i
was
assuming
i
was
going
to
get
something
that
really
pronounced
the
peppers
i
guess
leaving
things
set
back
a
bit
is
just
nicer
for
what
it
is
its
well
done
just
seems
a
bit
bland
to
me
one
of
my
favorites
from
rogue
this
ale
would
go
so
well
with
so
many
summer
foods
its
amazing
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
is
the
same
as
their
mexicali
ale
makes
sense
i
guess
the
beer
disembarks
the
22ounce
brown
bottle
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
modest
frothy
light
tan
head
and
the
residual
lace
forms
a
thin
covering
upon
the
glass
nose
is
as
one
would
expect
a
bit
peppery
lime
like
in
its
crispness
sweet
with
malt
and
the
start
somewhat
sweet
with
a
nice
grain
profile
the
top
is
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
is
moderate
in
acidity
and
the
hops
pleasantly
spicy
as
is
the
peppery
dry
aftertaste
a
drinkable
beer
but
as
with
the
juniper
not
one
of
rogues
better
beers
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
drinkability
is
average
can
understand
wanting
to
try
this
i
did
but
wouldnt
want
another
next
time
they
might
try
adding
more
peppers
worst
rouge
i
have
had
to
date
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
but
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
and
smoky
with
a
tabasco
thing
the
flavor
is
very
mild
with
the
pepper
lots
of
smoky
flavors
and
only
a
slight
bit
of
chipotle
spice
interesting
not
really
my
kind
of
thing
but
its
good
to
try
something
different
drinkability
would
be
good
with
an
angus
burger
nice
drinkable
ale
with
a
nice
extra
kick
in
the
end
comments
obviously
this
beer
would
be
fun
to
pair
with
spicy
food
for
a
double
whammy
spicy
food
lovers
take
note
this
beer
is
the
greatest
thing
that
ever
happened
anywhere
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
i
think
i
just
found
a
new
favorite
beer
this
would
definately
be
something
id
drink
with
a
porterhouse
steak
right
off
the
barbie
or
with
some
quality
mexican
food
i
couldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
but
every
so
often
i
would
find
myself
needing
a
drop
of
this
beer
if
only
for
the
fact
that
its
a
unique
sensory
experience
in
the
world
of
beer
drinking
you
wont
find
too
many
chili
beers
that
are
as
tasty
interesting
and
even
handed
as
this
very
good
drop
carbonation
is
light
mouthfeel
is
full
but
i
wouldnt
quite
describe
it
as
earthy
or
chewy
this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
a
rather
unique
novelty
brew
much
to
the
contrary
i
have
discovered
a
sweet
and
smoky
beer
with
an
unexpectedly
high
drinkability
good
with
ribs
drinkability

this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
not
as
exciting
or
chili
flavored
as
i
had
hoped
its
hard
to
judge
this
not
having
had
a
chili
beer
before
it
loses
points
for
not
having
too
much
chili
flavor
it
is
a
good
beer
that
i
could
see
drinking
with
a
variety
of
foods
but
the
flavor
makes
this
much
more
than
just
a
novelty
this
one
poured
a
dark
amber
with
hints
of
red
throughout
a
very
light
brown
somewhat
tan
head
formed
that
held
on
for
a
bit
then
fell
to
a
film
leaving
some
lacing
the
smell
was
of
some
smoke
lightly
roasted
malts
chili
peppers
and
some
hops
the
taste
was
sweetish
and
malty
at
the
front
with
some
hops
at
the
finish
and
only
a
faint
showing
of
smoked
peppers
very
disappointing
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
smooth
and
medium
bodied
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
would
have
to
say
that
22oz
was
a
bit
too
much
of
this
i
was
hoping
for
a
smoke
filled
fire
breathing
trip
through
hell
but
i
didt
get
it
oh
well
better
luck
next
time
overall
tastes
like
a
runofthemill
smoked
beer
to
me
and
a
rather
unbalanced
one
at
that
sadly
only
the
merest
hint
of
chipotle
pepper
in
the
back
end
here
i
love
spicy
food
and
peppers
but
im
glad
i
only
got
one
of
these
more
smoked
than
chipotle
which
was
a
disappointment
nevertheless
its
not
a
bad
brew
its
just
not
for
me
though
thanks
to
chris
for
sharing
this
with
me
it
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
slightly
chile
spicey
with
a
slight
grainey
sweet
background
the
chile
is
not
all
that
strong
but
it
is
well
in
the
front
of
the
brew
the
flavor
is
not
all
that
bad
there
is
a
smokeyness
that
hits
initially
the
chile
kicks
in
but
not
all
that
bed
no
burning
at
all
just
nice
roasted
chile
character
i
would
like
to
have
this
beer
with
some
mexican
food
no
real
heat
just
a
slight
spice
in
my
stomach
i
like
it
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
nice
healthy
carb
overall
this
is
drinkable
for
a
chile
brew
the
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
the
feel
is
good
the
nose
is
nice
i
think
if
you
review
this
to
style
it
should
be
top
dog
i
take
my
hat
off
to
rogue
for
this
brew
very
nice
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
head
almost
no
lacing
the
smell
is
weird
its
malty
a
little
hoppy
and
has
a
smoky
aroma
to
it
its
not
bad
at
all
the
taste
is
fairly
malty
up
front
but
then
the
smoky
peppers
come
in
they
dont
hit
you
hard
or
are
overpowering
but
just
subtle
not
too
shabby
slightly
hoppy
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
the
drinkability
is
just
a
little
harsh
fairly
decent
thanks

pours
a
clear
amber
hue
with
a
white
head
that
holds
for
a
few
minutes
and
falls
to
a
single
layer
of
bubbles
chipotle
smokiness
is
present
in
the
mostly
malty
aroma
a
pretty
standard
amber
ale
with
caramel
malt
flavors
and
spicy
hops
a
bit
papery
in
the
middle
oxidized
perhaps
or
maybe
just
the
effect
of
adding
chiles
to
the
beer
with
a
fairly
bitter
finish
just
a
touch
of
chipotle
flavor
and
a
just
a
hint
of
heat
in
the
finish
i
expected
a
little
more
heat
and
a
little
more
smokiness
would
probably
go
well
with
some
mexican
food
but
on
its
own
the
chile
flavor
is
a
bit
odd
the
pepper
flavor
along
with
the
chalky
finish
limits
the
drinkability
allinall
a
nice
oneoff
beer
but
nothing
i
could
do
for
a
session
but
i
sure
wish
i
had
some
more
almonds
this
beer
pours
into
the
pint
glass
a
dark
orange
with
a
big
bubble
head
that
drops
down
to
a
18
inch
top
smell
is
smoky
similar
to
the
rogue
smoke
ale
but
milder
some
malt
and
hops
struggles
through
taste
is
smoky
with
a
mild
heat
this
beer
could
use
just
a
touch
more
heat
though
my
wife
thought
it
was
too
hot
results
vary
by
palate
eh
the
smokiness
was
assertive
but
again
not
as
strong
as
in
the
smoke
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
the
smokiness
and
heat
providing
the
body
there
are
some
hops
noted
in
the
end
this
is
a
quaffable
brew
demanding
some
hearty
food
to
accompany
it
ill
have
this
on
hand
for
barbecues
this
summer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
except
of
this
beer
since
the
last
chile
beer
i
had
was
crazy
eds
and
i
didnt
care
for
that
one
bit
based
on
the
ba
rating
and
knowing
that
its
a
rogue
ale
i
knew
i
wouldnt
be
let
down
it
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
little
head
for
some
reason
i
was
excepting
a
strong
chile
smell
but
it
is
quite
mild
as
it
that
of
brown
ale
with
the
mouthfeel
you
have
a
nice
sense
of
carbonation
and
is
smooth
the
taste
is
similar
to
a
brown
ale
but
has
hint
of
another
flavor
i
just
cant
pinpoint
even
for
people
that
dont
like
the
idea
of
chile
in
beer
should
give
this
at
try
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
can
easily
drink
several
of
these
two
thumbs
up
on
this
one
glowing
amber
orange
with
a
creamy
orangetinged
head
with
good
lacing
i
cant
believe
the
difference
in
color
between
this
and
the
golden
is
only
the
chipotles
its
way
to
rich
in
color
sweet
malt
with
lots
of
smokiness
close
to
a
rauchbier
in
character
with
something
else
going
on
clean
tasting
beer
good
malt
presence
definite
chipotle
flavor
there
is
no
mistaking
this
for
a
rauchbier
slight
spicy
tingle
builds
after
a
few
sips
smokey
aftertaste
with
lingering
bitterness
tasty
brew
i
wouldnt
go
they
obvious
approach
and
pair
this
with
a
spicy
dish
but
this
would
be
a
nice
compliment
to
simply
prepared
chicken
or
an
assortment
of
mild
cheeses
pours
out
a
copper
color
head
ends
up
pretty
thin
can
definitely
pick
up
the
chipotles
in
the
aroma
taste
is
quite
smokey
and
peppery
has
some
hops
but
not
as
much
as
other
rogues
maybe
thats
what
is
missing
i
think
this
beer
would
go
well
with
a
lot
of
foods
especially
with
american
summertime
cuisine
right
now
my
tastebuds
are
looking
for
something
to
pair
it
with
feels
a
little
bit
oily
in
my
mouth
perhaps
i
may
revisit
this
one
when
i
can
eat
something
with
it
pours
out
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
decent
lace
light
smoky
smell
to
it
and
a
solid
malt
backbone
to
help
it
out
pretty
simple
nose
to
it
but
it
gets
the
jobs
done
taste
was
quite
malty
with
sweet
caramel
standing
out
and
a
solid
smokiness
throughout
the
flavor
a
tad
spicy
from
the
hops
or
the
peppers
nice
simple
and
very
clean
a
little
more
kick
would
have
done
it
good
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
and
the
goes
down
quite
easy
very
drinkable
stuff
even
more
so
with
a
meal
i
enjoyed
it
i
dont
think
i
will
have
another
one
of
these
i
admit
i
am
not
always
a
fan
of
smoke
beers
but
i
love
my
peppers
i
was
disappointed
i
like
hot
chiles
i
could
use
a
six
pack
of
this
over
the
winter
there
is
taste
there
however
onedimensional
chiles
with
a
smoke
offering
had
again
seven
months
later
and
similarly
liked
the
strong
taste
perhaps
i
am
a
contrarian
but
i
also
like
canadian
garlic
beer
not
bad
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
it
to
be
but
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
expected
it
to
be
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
quite
beautiful
it
has
a
deep
amber
color
with
golden
highlights
a
perfectly
composed
and
sized
white
head
that
eventually
recedes
to
a
ring
the
smell
picks
up
a
bit
on
the
smoked
chipotle
peppers
on
top
of
the
slightly
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
smokey
flavor
from
the
chipotle
but
it
is
not
disgustingly
strong
like
i
find
many
smoked
beers
to
be
such
as
the
rogue
smoke
ale
i
was
a
little
bit
disappointed
that
there
wasnt
more
of
a
sweet
bbq
type
of
flavor
in
the
back
or
even
the
spiciness
perhaps
one
day
if
i
am
ever
feeling
adventurous
and
if
it
is
available
i
will
have
to
try
the
cave
creek
if
it
is
the
flavor
and
spiciness
of
the
peppers
that
i
crave
worth
a
drink
dont
be
scared
to
take
the
plunge
i
know
i
was
chili
beer
even
though
i
tend
to
drink
every
beer
with
an
open
mind
and
palate
was
told
it
was
tapped
the
night
before
deep
and
amber
clear
with
a
dusting
of
faint
white
head
cant
smell
anything
really
just
slight
maltiness
very
clean
and
there
was
not
a
bit
of
smoke
in
the
air
smooth
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
but
you
barely
feel
it
nice
deep
and
malty
burnt
toast
bit
of
lingering
caramelly
sweetness
there
is
just
a
touch
of
a
tingle
to
your
tongue
but
no
heat
at
all
i
was
hoping
to
get
a
bit
of
it
i
knew
not
to
expect
a
cavecreek
or
anything
but
still
thought
i
would
catch
more
than
there
is
and
since
this
was
still
freshly
tapped
i
assume
this
is
what
the
heat
is
supposed
to
be
at
a
lot
of
flavor
is
left
in
your
mouth
decently
drinkable
with
nice
flavors
but
i
was
still
hoping
to
get
a
bit
of
a
punch
or
at
least
a
nudge
from
this
one
now
to
try
the
mole
black
tan
with
a
rogue
chocolate
stout
mmm
thats
ridiculously
tasty
overall
this
was
merely
a
delve
into
the
curiosity
corner
this
was
a
bottle
of
mexicali
actually
now
labeled
as
chipotle
id
like
to
retry
this
at
a
later
date
but
the
mexicali
might
be
past
its
prime
buttery
malty
ale
with
a
touch
of
tobasco
i
dont
know
how
drinkable
this
would
be
as
a
session
brew
but
it
would
likely
go
with
a
good
spicy
meal
a
helluva
lot
better
than
corona
i
was
hesitant
to
sample
this
style
but
seeing
as
i
like
damn
near
anything
that
is
spicy
and
rogue
brews
a
beer
within
this
style
i
figured
id
give
it
a
whirl
and
im
glad
i
did
it
pours
a
nice
copperorange
colour
with
minimal
head
but
what
is
there
is
rather
sticky
the
smell
is
mainly
your
basic
pale
ale
i
felt
with
a
nice
balance
between
earth
malt
and
sweet
hop
there
of
course
is
a
noticeable
chilepepper
smell
as
well
the
flavour
is
pretty
much
spot
on
starting
out
somewhat
dry
amnd
malty
before
hitting
a
touch
of
those
sweet
hops
and
then
finishing
with
a
spice
kick
that
will
hit
you
but
not
overpower
you
its
mixed
in
toward
the
end
just
right
and
provides
for
a
lovely
tingly
mothfeel
that
is
well
placed
with
the
carbonation
of
the
brew
while
i
cant
say
that
this
one
would
be
for
everyone
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
at
the
very
least
give
it
a
try
its
most
definitely
a
well
crafted
brew
even
if
it
is

a

color

of
dark

with
a
small
white
bubbly
head
that
melts
down
to
a
small
island
of
foam
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
i
had
a
bottle
of
rogue
smoke
ale
last
week
and
it
smells
about
the
same
smoke
taste
is
definitely
of
smoke
for
most
of
the
sip
but
leaves
a
chipotle
tang
at
the
end
not
anything
i
would
call
spicy
i
use
tabasco
at
least
2
meals
a
day
much
better
than
rogues
smoke
ale
but
nothing
i
would
get
ever
again
worth
a
try
though
hue
was
amber
to
a
slight
vermilion
little
head
to
speak
of
just
a
faint
skein
peppery
spiciness
accentuated
by
a
grottolike
outer
roundness
to
the
whole
nose
gay
not
sure
which
hot
peppers
were
used
in
this

chipolte
cascabel
california
hybrid
anaheim
jalapeno
pequin
or
serrano

but
whatever
they
were
they
fired
right
through
my
lips
leaving
a
scalding
trail
up
my
tongue
through
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
up
into
my
skull
and
i
loved
it
there
also
seemed
to
be
a
slight
cream
edge
like
bakers
chocolate
the
spice
didnt
really
catch
fire
until
five
or
six
seconds
after
each
swallow
i
was
happy
that
the
only
other
thing
i
was
eating
at
redbones
on
this
visit
was
water
and
not
their
barbecue
because
i
think
that
would
have
been
sheer
overkill
overall
this
is
a
mediumbodied
offering
and
one
that
i
would
choose
to
have
more
than
one
of
if
my
tongue
would
allow
it
i
truly
enjoyed
this
unusual
pour
and
in
the
end
it
packed
no
more
heat
than
a
few
drops
of
tabasco
had
ontap

the

chile
beers
are
one
of
the
few
that
i
rarely
have
a
favorite
in
but
there
is
a
better
sense
of
sweet
malt
balance
here
than
in
many
i
still
have
trouble
finishing
a
whole
bomber
of
this
one
though
intriguing
aroma
definitely
drinkable
but
dont
expect
a
refreshing
cold
one
or
anything
usually
i
drink
beer
to
quell
a
spice
burning
not
to
bring
one
on
in
moderation
this
is
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
however
this
really
doesnt
have
much
sessionability
due
to
the
heavy
pepper
spice
still
one
glass
is
interesting
and
im
glad
that
rogue
took
the
chance
on
the
experiment
and
id
probably
have
a
glass
again
how
did
this
find
its
way
to
vegas
owell
i
admit
it
didnt
sound
all
that
tastey
some
dude
described
it
heart
burn
in
a
bottle
but
i
couldnt
not
try
it
bought
a
bomber
and
brought
it
home
to
see
someone
had
gone
to
baja
fresh
and
had
tons
of
left
over
chips
and
salsa
seems
like
a
good
pairing
this
poured
out
a
clear
reddishcopper
with
a
nice
bubbly
white
head
the
aroma
is
nothing
intense
a
pleasant
light
mixture
of
smoke
peppers
and
malt
upon
first
taste
i
thought
its
alright
but
then
i
took
another
and
another
and
so
on
and
it
got
alot
better
light
smokiness
matched
up
with
a
lightly
sweet
malt
the
pepper
taste
is
def
there
and
it
gets
more
and
more
noticable
as
you
continue
drinking
the
heat
builds
up
but
never
to
a
point
where
it
isnt
enjoyable
crisp
and
lively
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
cool
beer
went
great
with
chips
and
salsa
this
get
a
brujeria
tribute
for
being
different
and
tastey
not
as
spectacular
as
other
rogue
offerings
but
in
the
right
time
and
place
it
has
its
moments
i
enjoyed
mine
with
spicy
enchiladas
and
mexicali
rogue
was
a
fine
companion
to
put
out
the
flames
from
the
chili
sauce
hmmm
now
this
one
is
very
interesting
apparantly
rogue
messed
up
a
bit
as
this
bottle
is
not
the
same
in
design
as
the
other
5
anniversary
beers
nevertheless
i
also
heard
that
this
was
the
same
as
mexicali
rogue
but
ive
never
had
that
one
yet
so
here
it
goes
the
pour
is
beautiful
a
glowing
reddish
colour
with
a
nice
white
head
that
lasts
for
a
bit
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
intriguing
some
strong
malts
a
touch
of
hops
some
smoke
and
a
bit
of
peppery
heat
the
taste
is
where
things
really
heat
up
this
brew
is
very
malty
and
almost
sweet
up
front
than
the
middle
is
smoky
and
the
finish
is
spicyhot
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
hot
and
the
drinkability
would
be
better
with
some
mexian
food
still
this
is
probably
the
best
pepper
beer
out
there
if
a
brewery
can
do
it
up
right
rogue
is
the
one
an
offering
i
thought
i
wouldnt
like
to
much
but
came
out
being
really
suprisedpours
a
golden
color
with
a
deep
orange
tint
with
not
much
head
that
seetles
pretty
quickly
aroma
is
of
bicuit
malt
with
a
touch
of
briney
chilies
taste
is
nice
and
crisp
off
the
bat
dry
malt
is
the
flavor
that
dominates
with
that
smokey
chili
flavor
that
come
mainly
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
it
gets
more
noticable
after
a
half
a
glass
my
wife
picked
out
the
chili
taste
right
away
without
even
knowing
it
was
a
chili
beer

am
proud
of
her
appearance

to
me

a
bit
thin

any
notable

drinkability
theres
not
enough
cohesion
in
the
flavors
here
unique
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
a
bit
of
a
novelty
brew
in
my
eyes
overall
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
it
was
bought
on
a
whim
by
a
friend
and
i
might
have
otherwise
not
tried
it
the
best
part
of
the
beer
for
me
was
the
lingering
residual
pepper
effect
the
further
and
further
you
got
down
on
the
pint
youd
notice
a
slight
heat
in
your
stomach
rising
upwards
could
be
dangerous
for
those
with
heartburn
issues
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
some
spanish
or
mexican
cuisine
however
22oz
bottle
served
chilled
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
only
a
few
patches
of
lace
were
left
on
the
glass
aroma
was
very
subdued
for
a
rogue
sweet
caramel
dominated
the
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
fruitiness
and
some
smoke
mouthfeel
was
actively
carbonated
with
some
mild
hop
bite
and
a
slight
twang
of
pepper
bite
taste
featured
the
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
a
balance
provided
by
sparing
use
of
the
westcoast
hops
i
could
detect
a
mild
smoky
chili
flavor
of
the
chipotle
peppers
but
theyre
in
the
background
very
well
balanced
overall
and
very
drinkable
i
think
this
one
would
be
better
with
a
more
assertive
pepper
presence
22
oz
bottle
im
still
waiting
for
these
chipotle
peppers
to
make
their
presence
known
i
bought
this
beer
a
few
months
ago
and
after
reading
some
reviews
i
thought
it
would
be
a
lot
different
than
it
actually
is
body
has
a
deep
golden
color
and
the
head
retains
well
for
a
short
while
then
disappears
the
peppers
are
not
at
all
noticeable
in
the
nose
however
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
are
quite
well
balanced
though
i
really
detect
very
little
pepperage
going
on
here
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
this
follows
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
a
hint
of
signature
rogue
hoppiness
comes
through
towards
the
finish
only
a
few
seconds
after
i
swallow
can
i
feel
a
bit
of
spiciness
on
my
tongue
i
wouldnt
say
i
can
taste
the
peppers
but
i
can
feel
the
heat
if
only
slightly
oh
and
i
didnt
expect
a
perfectly
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
but
thats
what
i
got
i
honestly
wanted
more
peppers
smoke
and
fire
that
may
be
the
only
time
i
ever
say
such
a
thing
22
ounce
bottle
one
of
my
lower
scores
for
a
rogue
beer
which
is
a
lineup
on
which
i
can
usually
count
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
pumped
for
something
special
from
the
addition
of
the
chipotle
peppers
not
much
going
on
here
perhaps
my
bottle
was
not
fresh
enough
and
the
peppers
had
faded
into
the
background
why
does
rogue
so
steadfastly
resist
any
dating
on
the
bottles
overall
this
probably
fell
in
the
more
mellowend
of
the
pale
ale
pool
pretty
boring
22
oz
bomber
my
first
chili
beer
figured
with
rogue
you
cant
go
wrong
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
with
an
orange
tinge
the
head
looked
nice
but
died
in
a
hurry
aroma
is
of
nice
bready
maltiness
with
some
slighty
meaty
aromas
a
good
dose
of
hops
taste
is
very
clean
there
is
nothing
special
here
really
some
very
slight
fig
fruitiness
at
first
which
gives
way
to
bitter
hops
some
spiciness
nothing
really
jumps
out
clean
mouthfeel
aftertaste
very
drinkable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
mediocre
offering
from
rogue
probably
better
to
spend
your
money
on
your
favorite
macro
instead
of
this
for
the
price
thanks
quaffer
for
the
beers
they
will
be
drank
happily
drinkability
well
its
higher
than
i
thought
it
would
be
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
lacking
any
sort
of
heat
i
wasnt
expecting
volcano
but
a
warm
glow
would
have
been
nice
not
one
of
my
favourites
from
rogue
but
you
cant
like
everything
not
to
say
i
wouldnt
gladly
drink
if
offered
just
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
over
their
other
beers
where
you
do
notice
the
peppers
is
an
odd
spot
in
the
back
of
your
throat
that
seems
to
warm
as
you
drink
the
beer
its
a
curious
feeling
and
absolutely
wonderful
a
truly
unique
brew
this
beer
pours
well
with
a
good
head
that
is
nice
and
light
the
color
is
a
good
solid
copper
color
that
is
slightly
hazy
the
aroma
was
very
poor
it
had
a
stale
smell
to
it
which
really
turned
me
off
but
once
i
got
past
the
smell
it
was
smooth
sailing
it
has
a
nice
dry
taste
that
is
obviously
spicy
along
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
awhile
big
old
thanks
to
bierriese
for
helping
me
to
reunite
this
oncetasted
ale
to
my
lips
once
more
drinkability
i
actually
poured
this
down
the
sink
well
i
was
scared
no
more
after
a
few
gulps
of
this
brew
the
peppers
are
pretty
subtle
and
only
add
to
hop
spiciness
it
has
a
good
pale
malt
backround
but
it
is
all
about
the
blend
of
the
hops
and
the
peppers
very
interesting
and
i
would
have
to
say
it
was
done
very
well
from
what
i
have
heard
about
other
pepper
beers
the
peppers
really
take
over
and
ruin
it
but
it
is
not
so
here
yet
another
interesting
brew
from
rogue
kind
of
a
cool
orange
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
smells
more
or
less
like
a
pale
ale
but
after
you
inhale
theres
just
the
slightest
most
minor
tingling
sensation
at
the
back
of
your
throat
its
not
hot
or
overly
spicy
but
its
definitely
a
unique
aroma
that
produces
a
unique
feel
starts
malty
with
a
dried
flower
grassy
taste
and
finishes
hoppy
its
really
like
a
nice
standard
pale
ale
sierra
nevadaish
with
just
a
subtle
kick
of
something
just
a
bit
more
spicy
through
the
middle
very
drinkable
i
can
see
this
going
well
with
a
variety
of
mexican
or
cheeserelated
foods
like
a
baked
burrito
or
a
pizza
which
is
what
i
ate
it
with
tonight
im
not
exactly
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
i
like
itbut
its
very
unique
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
fades
down
slow
leaving
a
sticky
thin
lace
a
mild
smoky
aroma
emerges
from
the
glass
intermixed
with
light
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
smell
initially
the
taste
was
a
bit
malty
followed
by
the
smokiness
of
burn
wood
finished
off
with
a
zing
of
spicy
chipotle
peppers
this
beer
is
great
matched
up
with
some
mexican
food
another
excellent
brew
from
rogue
this
cloudy
golden
brew
poured
a
tight
white
head
that
left
very
little
lace
smokey
floral
and
sweet
plum
aromas
are
slight
the
earthy
and
buttery
flavors
dont
stop
the
smoked
chipotle
peppers
from
asserting
themselves
i
dont
know
if
the
warming
feeling
is
from
the
peppers
or
the
alcohol
but
its
nice
my
expectations
of
mexicali
were
low
but
to
my
surprise
i
enjoyed
it
alot
the
beer
poured
a
nice
color
and
look
like
quite
a
beer
oddly
enough
there
was
no
detectable
smell
the
taste
was
quite
muted
as
well
i
wasnt
really
aware
of
the
taste
but
i
sensed
a
smokey
aftertaste
it
was
a
decent
base
ale
but
ill
probably
not
be
spending
upon
it
again
taste
all
malt
at
first
then
a
small
hint
of
hopes
and
the
smoke
pepper
come
in
ever
so
lightly
a
sweet
finish
at
the
end
great
mouth
feel
and
very
drinkable
another
fine
rogue
beer
this
beer
was
pretty
good
if
someone
has
to
make
a
beer
with
peppers
in
it
it
should
taste
like
this
beer
is
a
hazy
golden
small
creamy
offwhite
head
sits
on
top
pretty
light
nose
for
a
rogue
beer
a
little
malt
and
some
citric
hop
tones
i
wasnt
expecting
to
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
or
any
pepper
beer
for
that
matter
but
the
pepper
notes
are
ever
so
subtle
this
is
actually
an
enjoyable
brew
the
pepper
tones
are
kind
of
appealing
other
than
the
pepper
there
is
a
nice
mix
of
malt
and
hops
a
little
caramely
a
little
spicy
hop
bite
as
well
overall
this
one
is
pretty
good
mexicali
pours
with
a
modest
finelycarbonated
white
head
over
deep
golden
slightly
hazy
liquid
nose
is
a
bit
of
lightweight
malt
with
a
light
note
of
sulphur
tastes
malty
at
first
with
a
very
slight
smokiness
from
the
chipotle
peppers
then
a
nice
although
quite
subtle
heat
is
felt
in
the
throat
subsiding
quickly
finishes
a
bit
weaker
than
i
remember
its
been
a
year
or
two
since
i
last
tasted
it
it
used
to
have
a
bigger
flavor
to
it
but
still
is
a
unique
departure
in
the
light
ale
catagory
very
interesting
deep
copper
color
medium
head
and
some
lace
almost
a
neutral
smell
with
just
a
hint
of
smoke
and
rogue
hops
nice
full
mouthfeel
gives
way
to
some
malt
a
bit
of
hops
and
smoke
and
then
a
slightly
warm
chipotle
finish
the
amount
of
heat
is
just
right
and
then
leaves
a
smoked
aftertaste
very
tasty
would
go
great
with
some
cheese
and
crackers
and
some
smoked
meat
a
slightly
lower
score
for
drinkability
because
this
beer
will
not
agree
with
everyone
but
i
loved
it
first
pour
light
golden
with
lagerlike
clarity
and
full
head
second
pour
darker
orange
hazy
and
no
head
at
all
musty
odor
with
traces
of
smokiness
and
vague
hops
gentle
malts
are
quite
subdued
and
make
room
for
the
bold
finish
which
is
actually
more
smoky
than
spicy
still
the
peppers
linger
in
the
finish
long
beyond
the
beer
and
build
up
strength
in
a
way
that
is
completely
atypical
for
any
beer
i
have
tried
but
right
in
line
with
the
properties
of
hot
peppers
the
beer
itself
is
quite
nice
and
refreshing
smooth
and
the
smokiness
is
closer
to
a
bamberger
rauch
i
could
go
either
way
with
this
beer
it
woud
be
equally
good
and
much
less
intrusive
without
the
lingering
burn
but
it
does
make
the
beer
interesting
even
unique
notes
seriously
one
of
the
best
spicedherbal
ales
we
have
ever
had
some
complex
yet
very
well
balanced
and
oh
so
drinkable
all
at
the
same
time
a
generous
addition
of
smoked
chipotle
peppers
give
this
brew
the
heat
and
smoke
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
in
color
with
about
a
1finger
white
foamy
head
a
good
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
in
rings
actually
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
course
peppers
and
grains
pretty
much
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
bite
of
the
peppers
serrano
jalapeno
with
the
ale
afterwards
goes
down
and
warms
the
tummy
for
sure
but
drinkable
the
pepper
taste
doesnt
last
or
burn
your
mouth
but
does
hang
around
in
your
stomach
for
a
bit
lighter
to
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
for
this
style
of
brew
i
had
some
other
chili
brews
before
and
this
one
was
ok
but
nothing
really
special
i
wouldnt
go
buy
a
6pack
of
it
but
maybe
a
single
one
every
now
and
then
altogether
better
than
i
expected
not
really
great
but
could
go
well
some
decent
mexican
snacks
overall
a
better
selection
of
peppers
would
have
contributed
to
a
much
better
balance
of
heat
to
flavor
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
being
a
big
fan
of
the
chili
style
this
could
have
been
better
would
not
drink
again
overall
i
cant
say
im
a
chile
beer
aficionado
but
this
one
seems
to
style
i
cant
help
but
feel
like
this
beer
is
rated
unfairly
low
and
that
people
are
docking
it
because
of
a
distaste
for
the
style
chile
beer
is
certainly
an
odd
style
but
this
one
seems
to
have
all
the
characteristics
that
i
would
expectthe
only
area
in
which
i
feel
some
improvement
could
be
made
is
in
the
appearance
but
i
imagine
its
hard
to
get
a
nice
rocky
head
when
dealing
with
the
oils
from
the
chile
peppers
overall
as
advertised
i
like
it
a
lot
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
chile
beer
one
of
the
better
brews
that
weston
makes
o
this
is
my
first
chile
beer
so
i
have
nothing
to
base
it
on
but
i
do
think
they
did
a
fine
job
with
this
one
overall
i
would
say
that
i
liked
this
one
better
than
their
other
pepper
beer
it
was
alright
and
went
well
with
nachos
i
have
founded
it
with
two
different
labels
so
that
can
be
confusing
pours
a
clear
gold
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
strong
chile
slight
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
chile
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
a
noticeable
heat
from
the
pepper
tastes
of
strong
hot
pepper
not
distinctly
fresh
hint
of
hop
and
a
hint
of
pale
malt
overall
the
pepper
dominates
the
aroma
body
and
feel
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
infamous
cave
creek
chili
beer
which
is
not
a
good
thing
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
because
as
with
hot
peppers
too
much
of
a
good
thing
is
not
a
good
idea
the
heat
does
start
to
build
up
in
your
gut
as
you
finish
the
first
bottle
but
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
one
despite
its
underwhelming
appearance
drinks
okay
not
a
beer
to
seek
out
for
a
first
time
pepper
beer
experience
imo
drink
this
with
cheese
and
crackers
as
an
alternative
to
paring
with
an
ipa
for
pepper
people
or
just
the
adventurous
o
this
beer
has
a
strong
pepper
flavor
and
would
go
well
with
a
mexican
dish
if
you
like
spice
that
is
very
good
and
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
that
being
said
it
goes
down
like
water
for
me
a
spicy
pleasure
to
drink
although
a
bit
thin
i
could
put
down
a
couple
of
bombers
without
thinking
twice
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
creamy
head
lots
of
carbonation
in
this
one
nose
is
all
pepper
its
seerrano
one
of
my
favorite
peppers
theres
beer
in
here
if
so
you
cant
discern
it
from
the
smell
if
you
dont
like
peppers
then
im
not
sure
why
youre
drinking
this
if
you
do
then
you
know
what
youre
in
for
light
mouthfeel
if
it
wasnt
for
the
pepper
heat
it
would
be
quite
refreshing
taste
is
somewhat
vegetable
theres
little
hops
and
some
malt
but
this
one
is
clearly
balanced
towards
the
pepper
side
of
the
equation
the
beer
is
a
huckster
it
draws
you
in
with
a
light
fruity
hop
note
and
some
candy
corn
sweetness
before
thats
quickly
aborted
with
a
blast
of
serrano
chilis
that
finishes
the
whole
thing
interesting
as
a
diversion
would
make
a
unique
counterpoint
to
something
rich
and
creamy
maybe
a
clam
chowder
or
something
but
its
not
necessarily
something
that
you
would
reach
for
after
a
long
day
poured
a
22oz
bomber
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
with
just
a
inkling
of
a
head
like
all
true
pepper
beers
no
head
sticks
around
and
no
lacing
occurs
the
nose
is
fresh
cut
jalapenos
green
jalapenos
straight
off
the
plant
diced
up
and
vaporized
and
there
you
go
thats
the
nose
very
little
malty
sweetness
to
muddle
it
all
up
the
taste
is
exactly
the
same
fresh
cut
pepper
ive
never
gotten
so
much
heat
out
of
a
beer
this
beer
is
hot
but
not
boozy
fantastic
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
perfect
for
the
style
weston
i
dont
know
what
your
doing
but
your
doing
something
right
i
was
shocked
by
1
and
you
followed
it
up
with
a
fantastic
beer
albeit
a
beer
that
50
of
people
wont
like
i
do
have
to
say
im
drinking
it
while
eating
a
spicy
pepperoni
and
sharp
cheddar
pizza
and
it
works
spiffily
overall
hot
halfway
through
the
bottle
and
ive
already
broke
a
sweat
probably
will
not
buy
this
again
unless
i
plan
on
making
a
bet
with
a
friend
okay
i
must
admitill
probably
get
another
bottle
so
my
girlfriend
can
try
it
i
dont
think
she
could
handle
it
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
little
oily
it
was
a
chore
to
drink
this
beer
and
i
just
couldnt
finish
the
last
4
ounces
it
had
to
go
down
the
drain
this
is
one
lab
experiment
that
was
a
failure
this
is
amber
beer
is
spicy
from
start
to
finish
the
aroma
kicks
in
with
spicy
jalapeno
right
away
the
taste
has
an
immediate
kick
of
spicy
roasted
peppers
that
linger
well
into
the
aftertaste
in
case
ive
been
unclear
this
one
is
spicy
nearing
harshness
but
fun
regardless
should
pair
well
with
milder
foods
that
need
that
extra
zing
you
can
feel
it
going
down
your
intestines
gimic
beer
only
worth
a
sip
if
that
i
dont
even
know
how
to
rate
this
reminds
me
of
home
infused
habanero
vodka
which
i
think
is
what
they
were
going
for
if
i
could
give
less
than
1
star
i
would
excessively
hot
i
like
spicy
things
but
i
could
barely
get
down
a
sip
before
a
wave
of
heat
completely
coated
my
mouth
i
understand
trying
this
for
a
novelty
but
other
than
that
avoid
this
at
all
costs
your
intestines
will
never
forgive
you
otherwise
o
fuck
that
o
smells
and
tastes
pretty
decent
but
damn
it
is
hot
high
c
so
for
the
review
poured
a
weak
amber
color
with
no
head
aroma
is
worthless
just
some
juice
and
pepper
heat
no
flavor
just
an
okay
spicy
thin
lager
go
get
some
ghost
face
killah
if
you
want
a
serously
flaming
brew
that
one
sticks
to
the
tongue
like
a
cattle
brand
very
intense
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
the
other
bottle
if
you
are
a
true
chile
fanatic
this
beer
is
an
absolute
musttry
it
delivers
precisely
what
it
is
im
looking
for
its
not
even
remotely
as
overthetop
as
some
have
said
its
exactly
what
it
claims
to
be
o
what
the
hell
was
i
thinking
i
tried
this
at
a
bar
last
year
i
thought
i
could
drink
a
bottle
if
i
do
it
will
take
all
day
it
may
just
end
up
in
the
chili
i
am
making
this
is
a
bottle
to
share
and
punish
your
friends
it
is
not
as
hot
as
last
years
version
it
was
made
with
pepper
purée
this
batch
was
just
steeped
with
peppers
so
i
was
told
i
like
spicy
food
but
i
think
i
am
done
with
this
beer
d
drinks
like
a
hot
sauce
great
for
parties
although
we
ended
up
with
8oz
left
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
curious
if
this
was
hotter
when
it
was
fresh
i
also
discovered
this
was
equally
as
hot
coming
out
as
it
was
going
in
it
should
this
beer
is
shared
one
ounce
at
a
time
and
even
then
it
will
be
hard
to
finish
overall
this
was
a
great
novelty
and
a
terrible
beer
it
could
not
be
finished
and
if
it
were
solely
up
to
me
i
would
have
poured
11
of
the
12
ounces
i
cant
recommend
this
to
anyone
seriously
but
if
you
know
someone
who
cant
get
enough
heat
this
may
be
right
up
their
alley
this
was
the
hottest
thing
i
have
ever
consumed
food
or
drink
o
overall
this
was
a
a
very
unique
and
challenging
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
a
huge
chili
head
yah
this
was
awesome
i
know
its
not
for
everyone
but
yah
me
personally
i
enjoyed
the
experience
ghost
scorpion
is
brewed
with
supposedly
the
two
hottest
chiles
in
the
world
ghost
and
scorpion
from
where
im
sitting
ill
buy
that
it
makes
for
awful
beer
but
its
damn
hot
i
guess
if
thats
your
thing
knock
yourself
out
id
suggest
steering
clear
of
this
one
though
seriously
heed
those
words
seriously
though
my
stomach
is
literally
boiling
and
curdling
itself
it
is
very
unhappy
with
me
the
heat
on
the
mouth
and
throat
was
good
mostly
tolerable
but
once
in
the
stomach
my
body
seems
to
be
rejecting
my
stomach
its
not
like
i
want
to
throw
up
more
like
my
body
wants
to
shovel
my
entire
stomach
out
of
itself
am
i
going
to
die
o
id
like
to
see
someone
try
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
way
too
painful
to
drink
o
i
had
a
great
time
drinking
this
beer
one
of
my
buddies
gargled
with
it
so
then
the
rest
of
had
to
follow
suit
so
we
wouldnt
look
like
bitches
its
hot
way
hot
if
youre
looking
for
the
hottest
beer
in
the
world
this
is
probably
it
its
definitely
an
interesting
experience
and
for
what
it
is
its
great
high
marks
for
this
one
because
seriously
if
youre
drinking
this
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
dont
act
all
surprised
when
it
burns
the
hell
out
of
you
really
this
beer
should
be
a
01
since
it
has
no
beer
quality
sans
a
few
bubbles
and
its
golden
amber
color
give
ghost
scorpion
a
try
if
youre
brave
enough
i
guarantee
that
it
will
be
memorable
i
bought
2
bottles
and
opened
one
to
drink
this
is
not
a
beer
this
is
an
event
the
hottest
thing
in
the
world
i
agree
with
the
numbing
effect
on
the
lips
two
sips
in
i
had
to
do
a
shot
of
milk
to
get
to
the
third
sip
poured
the
rest
down
the
drain
and
two
days
later
made
chili
with
the
second
bottle
2
quarts
of
chili
with
one
bottle
of
this
beer
and
my
coworkers
thought
i
was
texas
red
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
idea
but
a
better
ingredient
maybe
even
better
as
a
party
toughman
contest
need
another
bottle
edit
i
was
unable
to
finish
this
beer
i
was
working
on
it
slowly
doing
chores
when
suddenly
my
stomach
cramped
up
as
i
do
have
acid
and
stomach
issues
trying
this
beer
was
illadvised
anyway
so
i
decided
to
stop
after
consuming
a
third
of
it
rather
than
continue
the
punishment
when
i
was
17
one
of
my
friends
sprayed
pepper
spray
in
my
basement
drinking
this
was
a
terrible
reminder
of
that
day
holy
crap
what
a
beer
this
was
very
different
with
the
powerful
taste
it
was
worth
trying
but
hard
to
drink
more
than
two
glasses
of
due
to
the
power
of
the
spice
yeah
i
rated
it
high
its
everything
the
label
says
and
then
some
if
you
dont
like
heat
you
wont
enjoy
this
but
if
you
enjoy
hot
hot
peppers
your
in
for
a
treat
good
spicy
brew
worth
a
try
not
sure
what
everyone
was
expecting
when
they
bought
this
but
i
like
hot
and
this
beer
came
through
peppers
were
still
there
after
letting
it
sit
cant
taste
the
bourbon
at
all
the
peppers
completely
overpower
everything
tastea
literal
hot
mess
even
with
or
maybe
because
of
a
year
in
the
cellar
this
brew
was
just
too
much
heat
and
pepper
flavor
to
achieve
any
real
balance
in
my
opinion
i
split
this
brew
with
another
veteran
craft
beer
drinker
and
we
were
hard
pressed
to
finish
it
all
we
didnt
have
the
tastebuds
left
to
try
the
punishment
ill
give
that
one
another
year
and
see
what
happens
heres
hoping
just
awful
i
enjoy
spicy
food
not
spicy
peppers
in
my
beer
instant
heartburn
complete
waste
of
time
and
money
what
did
you
all
expect
not
for
those
who
do
not
enjoy
heat
the
oaked
bastard
taste
comes
out
very
strongly
followed
by
an
intense
heat
which
lingers
and
settles
into
the
glorious
lucky
bastard
finish
fantastic
overpowering
pepper
flavor
bourbon
taste
is
almost
demolished
and
barely
perceptible
a
sipping
brew
for
those
that
like
heat
lots
of
heat
but
this
bastard
was
destroyed
ruined
per
stone
rather
than
waste
the
rest
i
used
the
2nd
half
of
the
bottle
to
marinade
a
skirt
steak
for
carne
asada
interesting
enough
here
the
bourbon
barrel
flavor
came
out
stronger
than
the
peppers
although
this
is
a
rather
expensive
marinade
and
still
was
not
up
to
my
usual
skirt
steak
seasoning
although
it
was
interesting
this
is
spicy
for
me
it
wasnt
enjoyable
to
drink
i
imagine
for
those
who
love
pepper
this
is
great
even
thought
this
wasnt
very
enjoyable
to
drink
it
is
well
made
i
love
hot
and
spicy
food
but
this
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
i
have
enjoyed
most
things
i
have
purchased
from
stone
over
the
years
this
and
punishment
were
the
expensive
exceptions
the
peppers
were
overpowering
to
the
point
that
i
couldnt
enjoy
the
ale
and
had
to
get
rid
of
it
definitely
not
for
someone
who
hates
heat
somewhat
of
a
novelty
beer
in
that
it
has
tons
of
punch
to
it
however
i
have
no
problem
eating
a
hot
pepper
taste
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
however
the
capsaicin
does
take
over
a
little
too
much
the
beer
will
not
burn
your
face
and
make
you
cry
for
water
however
though
it
would
be
great
if
the
heat
was
turned
down
a
bit
for
the
next
batch
if
there
is
one
cheers
plenty
of
heat
very
situational
beer
went
well
with
a
hearty
breakfast
now
theres
the
chili
beer
ive
been
looking
for
holy
hell
this
is
hot
i
am
a
heat
lover
through
and
through
and
have
wanted
to
experience
the
paradoxical
situation
of
drinking
something
thats
intensely
spicy
and
then
reaching
for
the
same
glass
the
cleanse
that
heat
from
my
palate
this
does
exactly
that
there
are
plenty
of
flavors
here
though
if
you
can
make
it
through
the
heat
you
can
definitely
taste
a
woody
ale
im
guessing
its
from
the
oaked
arrogant
bastard
but
theres
a
charred
and
peppery
green
bell
pepper
flavor
that
im
getting
too
thats
mixing
in
with
it
nicely
from
the
variety
of
chilis
in
this
i
cant
stop
drinking
it
heat
isnt
everyones
bag
but
its
a
very
different
beast
to
try
and
enjoy
all
of
the
flavors
in
here
while
still
experiencing
and
possibly
enjoying
depending
on
your
tastes
the
burn
with
a
sweaty
brow
nostrils
running
and
a
mouth
in
burning
beverage
heaven
i
absolutely
recommend
this
to
those
looking
for
over
the
top
spicy
brews
damn
i
shouldve
bought
more
just
plain
awful
overpowering
heat
and
spice
takes
everything
away
from
the
beer
truly
is
a
crime
poor
showing
stone
500
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
bottled
october
2013
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
reddishbrown
color
with
some
sediment
floaties
noticeable
theres
about
an
inch
tan
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
long
time
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
mostly
like
spicy
and
green
peppers
along
with
some
caramel
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
a
bit
of
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
that
kicks
in
after
a
while
but
this
brew
is
all
about
the
spicy
peppers
its
good
and
hot
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
liked
this
yeah
i
finished
the
bottle
and
my
eyes
are
watering
right
now
but
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
again
in
the
future
but
its
certainly
a
brew
that
i
would
have
to
be
in
a
certain
mood
to
drink
because
its
hotter
than
most
of
the
chili
beers
ive
tried
before
crime
is
getting
a
bad
wrap
from
people
who
dont
understand
what
this
beer
is
this
beer
is
mouth
punishing
with
peppers
hot
and
spicy
the
way
stone
wanted
it
this
beer
isnt
meant
to
be
consumed
by
one
person
eating
cookies
it
was
made
for
small
glasses
and
shared
in
good
company
with
a
cheese
board
its
also
fantastic
to
cook
with
just
make
it
a
reduction
and
boil
unflavored
sausage
in
it
o
these
is
no
denying
how
hot
this
beer
is
it
stings
the
throat
and
does
not
apologize
i
love
spicy
hot
food
but
i
think
when
it
comes
to
having
it
in
my
beer
i
am
a
little
put
off
somehow
o
as
a
chile
beer
it
does
pretty
well
but
they
could
have
used
a
lesser
base
beer
and
skipped
the
barrel
aging
and
dry
hopping
o
call
me
crazy
but
this
was
actually
good
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
often
but
i
actually
enjoyed
it
more
than
other
spicy
beers
ive
had
more
depth
and
complexity
than
i
was
expecting
right
so
remember
we
are
reviewing
a
chili
beer
with
crime
given
that
i
think
this
brew
stacks
up
nicely
in
the
category
reddish
brown
in
color
wih
a
fading
tan
head
crime
greets
the
nose
with
vanilla
caramel
malts
hot
peppers
and
dark
chocolate
after
imvibing
you
feel
the
heat
from
the
capsician
big
time
i
could
see
how
the
spiciness
might
be
too
much
for
those
sensitive
to
heat
but
as
a
hot
sauce
enhusiast
and
master
crafter
i
can
dig
it
after
the
initial
pepper
blast
you
begin
to
taste
the
rich
caramel
and
barrel
aged
blend
of
the
basardt
not
a
subtle
beer
but
fun
to
drink
in
small
quantities
gave
me
a
good
sweat
maybe
a
sligjt
endorphin
kick
medium
bodied
light
effervescence
fairly
smooth
too
though
drying
at
the
finish
the
reviews
for
this
might
improve
as
the
bottles
are
aged
stone
if
you
read
this
ease
up
on
the
jalapenos
and
try
and
keep
some
balance
you
are
better
than
this
oh
and
make
a
triple
bastard
so
that
i
can
die
happy
this
is
one
wretched
beer
drinking
wise
i
was
thinking
id
pour
it
down
the
drain
but
it
might
make
a
decent
marinading
ingredient
or
maybe
to
go
in
chili
so
im
sticking
it
in
the
fridge
that
20
price
tag
is
a
damn
steep
price
for
a
cooking
beer
though
maybe
i
should
reverse
my
not
well
brewed
designation
because
i
think
this
does
exactly
what
they
wanted
it
to
do
but
i
also
think
what
they
wanted
it
to
do
isnt
what
most
people
would
want
me
personally
i
like
hot
things
but
im
not
one
of
those
weird
scoville
devotees
so
even
though
this
was
tasty
it
was
still
hard
to
get
through
16
ounces
of
it
a
for
creativity
and
boldness
b
for
execution
500ml
bottle
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
an
inch
of
head
the
aroma
is
hot
pepper
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
pepper
and
hot
peppers
with
plenty
of
heat
coats
your
throat
with
heat
i
think
i
can
pick
up
on
some
bastard
but
its
hidden
behind
the
wall
of
spice
and
heat
not
abusively
hot
but
spicy
for
sure
slick
mouthfeel
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
overall
i
couldnt
drink
this
all
the
time
or
maybe
even
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
not
as
hot
or
as
bad
as
i
thought
itd
be
this
has
been
aging
for
a
few
months
so
it
may
have
helped
mellow
things
a
bit
m
big
medium
its
a
crime
that
this
beer
has
made
it
to
production
and
was
actually
bottled
i
applaud
stone
for
trying
to
be
different
but
seriously
whos
idea
was
this
fortunately
i
had
this
during
a
sampling
at
a
whole
foods
dont
worry
about
this
being
sold
out
theres
plenty
to
go
around
overall
some
of
these
rating
make
me
lose
faith
in
humanity
its
called
crime
punishment
is
called
punishment
expect
to
be
criminally
punished
punished
like
a
criminal
etc
i
would
honestly
drink
a
small
pour
of
this
anytime
and
would
probably
buy
this
somewhat
often
if
not
for
the
price
i
am
going
to
have
to
give
punishment
another
go
sometime
and
maybe
save
some
of
it
for
cooking
i
like
being
punished
chiles
and
these
beers
it
is
a
bit
depressing
how
low
the
rating
for
this
beer
is
what
do
people
expect
in
such
a
beer
especially
a
chili
beer
crime
and
punishment
by
stone
have
captured
by
far
the
best
freshest
hot
pepper
flavors
of
any
chili
beer
i
have
had
exemplary
for
the
style
lovehate
i
suppose
but
i
loved
these
beers
o
i
love
hot
stuff
but
this
just
brutal
ive
had
ghost
peppers
that
were
tastier
than
this
not
quite
as
bad
as
punishment
for
some
reason
but
its
still
impossible
to
drink
a
few
sips
was
all
i
could
manage
o
as
a
disclaimer
i
like
spicy
food
let
me
back
up
what
i
should
say
is
that
i
like
spicy
food
when
everything
including
the
heat
works
harmoniously
when
somethings
insanely
hot
just
to
be
insanely
hot
it
just
becomes
masochistic
at
that
point
with
that
aside
ive
been
waiting
for
a
beer
like
crime
for
a
long
time
chili
beers
seem
to
ride
the
fence
of
too
little
to
decent
affect
or
too
poorly
done
to
be
enjoyable
but
crime
manages
to
up
the
ante
while
being
a
drinkable
beer
the
time
this
chili
beer
has
spent
in
bourbon
barrels
seems
pointless
considering
the
fact
almost
no
attribute
shows
through
but
the
ridiculous
chili
flavor
and
heat
dont
completely
obliterate
the
bastard
beneath
beer
is
still
a
part
of
this
beer
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
spicy
food
chances
are
youll
like
this
beer
lets
clear
one
thing
up
first
this
will
go
over
like
a
turd
in
a
punchbowl
if
you
take
it
to
a
party
the
aroma
has
an
amazing
smell
of
dirty
socks
and
grandpas
asshole
the
color
looks
like
i
got
four
scoops
of
chipotles
extra
hot
salsa
and
shit
it
out
the
next
morning
floaties
included
the
flavor
tastes
like
my
dog
ran
through
a
grassy
patch
and
scooted
her
ass
on
the
carpet
and
then
i
licked
it
up
overall
i
think
i
might
go
puke
because
this
beer
makes
me
think
of
justin
beiber
and
miley
cyrus
making
out
i
cant
think
of
anything
worse
in
this
world
please
save
yourself
the
trouble
and
go
watch
sharknado
4
times
in
a
row
you
will
thank
me
later
in
lieu
of
waterboarding
at
guantanamo
bay
please
send
the
rest
of
this
crap
there
no
more
terrorism
bam
good
lord
one
sip
worst
beer
ever
post
bottle
edit
so
my
initial
review
was
only
after
a
few
sips
and
i
can
appreciate
what
they
are
going
for
however
i
found
that
it
was
basically
unpleasant
to
actually
try
to
finish
the
500ml
bottle
the
heat
builds
and
is
unrelenting
and
to
be
honest
the
flavour
while
interesting
at
first
gets
a
little
old
i
actually
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
this
would
have
been
nice
to
try
in
a
smaller
size
like
300ml
at
most
but
i
find
it
unfortunate
to
have
paid
a
high
price
for
a
bottle
that
would
have
been
a
chore
to
finish
still
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
but
share
it
with
a
friend
or
two
500
ml
bottle
aroma
of
peppers
and
bourbon
barrel
vanilla
fruit
poured
an
unattractive
greenamber
color
tasteyes
yes
tons
of
heat
but
what
impresses
me
is
the
flavor
of
the
lukcy
and
the
bourbon
barrel
still
shine
through
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
horrible
due
to
the
reviews
i
read
enjoyable
nonetheless
the
heat
is
intense
yet
both
flavorful
and
bearable
and
more
than
just
heat
you
can
really
taste
the
chiles
as
well
i
enjoy
very
hot
food
and
this
is
enjoyable
to
me
while
at
the
same
time
i
can
see
how
it
is
nowhere
near
enjoyable
for
others
i
think
stone
did
a
great
job
here
if
you
cant
take
the
heat
you
never
shoulda
bought
it
overall
the
best
things
about
this
brew
are
its
nose
and
its
taste
honestly
as
it
seems
with
all
the
failed
bigname
brews
on
this
site
many
people
ignore
style
and
go
straight
for
subjective
comparative
value
of
their
beers
this
is
the
case
here
the
spice
is
wonderful
but
you
definitely
have
to
be
able
to
appreciate
something
spicy
it
reminds
us
of
founders
spite
series
that
they
aged
in
wood
with
peppers
the
habanero
was
the
hottest
of
that
series
and
this
reminds
us
of
that
crime
might
be
a
shade
hotter
off
the
bat
but
by
the
end
it
can
only
get
so
hot
and
it
evens
out
it
actually
smooths
out
with
warmth
quite
a
bit
and
after
the
first
half
of
the
glass
allowing
for
much
more
of
the
bourbon
and
underlying
caramel
tastiness
to
shine
though
and
balance
things
out
the
bastard
series
is
a
great
base
for
this
affording
gentle
but
sugary
sweetness
and
cooked
warmth
it
is
so
exciting
to
see
such
a
hot
and
progressive
beer
like
this
bottled
and
distributed
rather
widely
if
you
want
our
advice
to
enjoy
this
you
must
take
it
at
face
value
for
what
it
is
and
not
expect
it
to
displace
your
current
favorites
rather
take
to
it
with
an
open
mind
and
a
love
for
spicy
food
and
you
just
might
just
find
something
delightful
o
leaving
value
for
money
out
of
the
equation
this
beer
is
offputting
and
unworthy
of
recommendation
since
it
is
more
expensive
than
a
firestone
walker
seasonal
release
it
is
thoroughly
wasteful
and
pointless
in
every
conceivable
way
save
your
money
your
palate
and
your
time
poured
from
a
cork
and
cage
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
auburnbrown
coloring
with
a
filmy
lowprofile
offwhite
head
slick
cling
left
along
the
glass
nose
of
chili
heat
with
vanilla
undertones
and
woody
notes
not
much
past
the
heat
in
all
honesty
flavors
of
heat
forward
solid
and
strong
with
a
sharp
pepper
spice
throughout
waves
of
heat
and
pepper
spice
cascade
over
your
palate
mouth
and
throat
there
are
some
vanilla
and
bourbon
notes
in
the
backbone
with
a
boozy
highlight
too
thick
smooth
bodied
with
a
heat
and
pepper
aftertaste
the
finish
is
all
heat
wow
this
is
rough
i
couldnt
finish
it
to
drink
but
it
did
make
a
mean
chili
the
next
day
o
the
heat
is
just
way
too
much
some
nice
flavors
come
through
but
after
a
few
sips
it
is
overwhelming
which
it
apparently
was
at
the
tap
takeover
event
a
guy
sitting
two
stools
away
from
me
left
with
his
fourounce
taster
of
crime
sitting
with
just
one
taste
taken
after
a
while
the
bartender
took
it
away
and
smelled
it
ill
be
picking
up
a
lot
of
these
tonight
he
mumbled
to
himself

and
definitely
a
stomach
wrecker
if
drunk
at
the
end
of
the
night
i
would
ave
rated
it
higher
if
the
heat
level
was

me

not
drinkable
i
had
4oz
if
your
not
a
pepper
head
you
can
not
appreciate
this
beer
the
day
after
last
st
patricks
day
i
went
out
and
bought
the
last
2
bottles
my
local
place
in
eugene
had
now
with
a
year
of
age
im
going
to
follow
up
the
tradition
and
totally
enjoy
my
second
bottle
cheers
to
you
greg
and
thank
you
for
my
favorite
pepper
beer
of
all
time
be
prepared
for
this
one
i
think
its
one
of
the
great
unique
beers
its
something
special
but
its
not
easy
to
drink
not
drinkable
too
spicy
to
take
a
second
sip
of
look
its
still
a
terrible
beer
maybe
a
mixer
for
something
but
crazy
expensive
there
is
no
way
bourbon
barrels
were
needed
for
this
but
hey
its
a
million
times
better
than
crime
quite
hot
but
not
overbearing
i
quickly
grew
accustomed
the
heat
but
that
made
the
flavor
of
the
base
beer
more
apparent
which
wasnt
necessarily
a
good
thing
this
level
of
heat
in
a
sour
ale
like
uprights
fatali
four
would
be
great
this
beer
is
like
drinking
liquid
capsaicin
really
there
is
not
much
else
to
say
there
is
so
much
spice
heat
in
this
beer
that
there
really
isnt
much
else
that
you
notice
awful
awful
terrible
beer
and
im
severely
disappointed
i
bought
it
should
have
checked
beer
advocates
rating
before
plopping
down
35
on
this
guy
this
is
actually
not
as
bad
as
many
score
it
it
is
work
to
get
through
but
it
has
a
place
i
think
that
matching
it
with
either
spicy
or
to
contrast
nonspicy
food
may
actually
be
okay
to
give
a
try
o
simply
nuclear
while
i
simply
adore
hot
and
spicy
food
i
think
i
draw
the
line
when
it
comes
to
having
it
in
my
beer
it
tasted
fine
starting
out
but
quickly
changes
to
just
start
tasting
like
burning
overall
i
am
telling
you
with
the
utmost
confidence
this
beer
is
a
waste
of
money
its
punishment
enough
how
much
they
charge
for
a
bottle
i
split
this
amongst
friends
and
everyone
agreed
it
just
too
spicy
to
even
be
called
a
beer
best
use
for
the
beer
is
to
use
it
for
marinade
which
i
ended
up
doing
anyway
no
beer
wasted
in
this
family
edit
i
had
no
heartburn
while
drinking
these
nor
any
stomach
problems
the
next
day
it
didnt
even
burn
coming
out
win
one
of
the
worst
ever
i
couldnt
finish
it
the
name
punishment
says
it
all
do
people
really
like
this
i
like
hot
peppers
and
a
little
beer
kick
is
cool
but
this
is
just
silly
i
hate
pouring
out
beer
but
i
couldnt
take
another
burning
punishing
sip
of
pain
and
tongue
torture
i
couldnt
even
describe
the
mouthfeel
or
taste
or
other
senses
the
did
a
good
job
if
the
wanted
to
ruin
the
beer
with
this
one
not
sure
what
the
goal
was
or
if
this
is
a
joke
i
see
it
around
and
its
expensive
so
people
must
like
it
but
it
nots
for
me
confession
im
not
big
on
hot
peppersbut
in
recent
years
ive
gotten
a
bit
more
into
spicier
foods
im
a
bit
intimidated
by
this
one
deep
brown
hued
with
a
bit
of
light
haziness
a
quarter
inch
of
khaki
colored
head
rests
on
top
odd
aroma
from
the
chilies
and
peppers
almost
gives
it
a
cinnamon
sweet
aroma
not
inviting
whoa
that
first
taste
tells
me
all
i
need
to
know
im
way
out
of
my
league
all
i
get
is
a
burning
sensation
and
a
scorched
palate
my
tongue
and
especially
my
lips
are
burned
i
think
my
chances
of
finishing
this
are
zero
i
cant
recall
the
last
time
that
happened
i
honestly
poured
the
rest
out
without
another
sip
fail
im
not
one
to
drain
pour
a
full
bottle
especially
one
this
expensive
but
wow
short
of
using
it
to
marinate
some
steaks
i
cant
see
any
other
way
im
going
to
get
through
this
bottle
ok
its
a
spicy
beer
i
get
that
but
its
just
too
hot
to
enjoy
i
love
hot
food
but
this
is
sadly
about
1015
too
hot
to
enjoy
too
bad
because
it
looks
wonderful
someone
else
said
i
cant
understand
how
someone
who
would
spend
the
money
to
buy
this
would
rank
it
low
wth
so
the
logic
here
is
if
it
costs
a
lot
and
20
for
a
bomber
is
a
lot
to
me
i
have
to
rank
it
well
ummm
no
i
dont
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
back
overall
by
far
the
most
expensive
drainpour
ever
actually
no
im
still
too
damn
cheap
for
that
i
poured
what
i
could
back
in
the
bottle
maybe
an
ounce
less
than
full
it
is
headed
for
a
brutal
entry
into
the
next
beer
tasting
i
love
stone
but
this
is
one
of
the
5
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
yikes
im
feeling
a
little
nauseous
after
that
o
punishment
takes
crime
and
ups
the
ante
slightly
to
be
quite
frank
from
their
description
after
enjoying
crime
i
was
pretty
nervous
for
the
heat
level
of
punishment
but
its
damn
similar
both
beers
convey
a
hearburn
inducing
heat
level
that
tugs
at
facial
sweat
glands
while
maintain
a
good
flavor
profile
of
chilies
while
chilies
are
the
focus
this
beer
keeps
a
clear
beer
base
but
its
futile
time
in
bourbon
barrels
is
identical
to
that
of
crime
nonexistent
in
aroma
or
flavor
punishment
didnt
seem
to
bother
me
as
much
as
crime
it
is
still
too
sweet
and
vegetal
for
my
liking
overall
it
is
a
winters
night
this
beer
made
sense
maybe
i
was
biased
by
the
abrasively
cold
below
zero
weather
and
high
winds
but
this
is
a
devastatingly
good
chile
beer
i
wont
be
hurt
to
see
this
beer
sit
on
the
shelves
awhile
so
that
i
can
indulge
again
in
it
if
you
are
a
true
lover
of
big
beers
and
really
hot
peppers
this
is
the
ticket
overall
try
it
if
your
like
me
and
are
always
looking
for
something
new
and
different
and
like
rich
complex
beer
with
good
food
i
ate
this
with
some
chicken
wings
and
fresh
veggies
also
share
this
with
3
or
more
people
i
shared
mine
with
4
other
people
and
still
didnt
finish
the
bottle
very
spicy
filling
rich
and
delish
but
only
able
to
have
2
to
4
oz
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
crime
stone
punishment
35
update
i
couldnt
drink
this
i
enjoy
spicy
foods
that
literally
make
my
eyes
water
and
my
nose
run
but
this
crossed
some
kind
of
line
a
line
that
i
didnt
even
know
i
had
but
i
did
save
it
and
i
added
it
to
some
rice
and
beans
the
result
was
stellar
i
thought
about
upgrading
my
score
but
this
is
a
beer
not
a
hot
sauce
spicier
and
a
bit
more
complex
than
crime
and
that
works
in
its
favor
spicy
and
pushes
the
limits
but
never
crosses
if
you
have
to
pick
choose
this
one
wow
this
is
one
inventive
and
impressive
brew
much
like
crime
this
one
has
completely
transformed
my
view
of
what
beer
can
be
very
intense
yet
pleasing
in
a
way
this
beer
has
immediately
induced
a
cholinergic
response
manifested
as
a
watering
mouth
and
runny
nose
i
also
feel
that
punishment
has
induced
an
endorphin
release
not
to
mention
the
pleasing
effects
of
the
disguised
alcohol
put
it
all
together
the
flavor
the
intensity
the
feeling
and
you
have
one
incredible
and
addictive
beer
drinking
experience
this
dose
of
punishment
was
an
absolute
pleasure
o
i
put
3
tablespoons
in
my
chili
i
save
what
was
left
in
the
bottle
for
a
friend
to
try
and
his
response
was
the
same
as
mine
all
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
which
is
really
sad
because
i
love
stones
brews
but
this
was
undrinkable
not
sure
what
i
will
do
with
crime
overall
not
a
great
beer
and
a
novelty
to
be
sure
but
punishment
pulls
this
off
better
than
crime
imo
mouthfeel
is
smooth
light
i
like
this
beer
but
i
have
to
sip
it
slowly
a
excellent
beer
with
a
great
showcase
of
peppers
aroma
fresh
chili
peppers
hard
to
single
out
any
in
particular
taste
upfront
is
wave
of
chili
garden
green
jalapeno
and
smoke
leading
to
caramel
butterscotch
middle
and
fiery
finish
very
intriguing
at
first
somewhat
onesided
and
painful
as
the
capsaicin
burns
its
path
initially
through
out
sipping
malt
sweetness
and
caramel
becomes
more
prevalent
and
burning
dulls
to
where
becomes
more
complex
and
bourbon
shines
thru
personally
set
out
to
only
have
a
glass
then
wife
waived
the
white
flag
after
first
sip
and
was
stuck
finishing
the
bottle
which
towards
the
end
felt
like
punishment
with
senses
saying
no
more
peppers
a
great
experience
but
bring
friends
to
help
endure
the
ride
to
really
appreciate
this
beer
and
stone
approach
of
a
chili
brew
bottom
line
would
i
buy
it
again
yeah
definitely
i
also
love
chile
beers
brew
them
and
find
them
immensely
interesting
for
the
price
point
though
its
still
a
bit
hard
to
justify
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
sampling
this
before
buying
if
you
have
any
fears
of
the
press
about
it
i
cant
say
this
beer
was
bad
its
amazing
if
what
your
going
for
was
a
megaheatpepperexperiamentalnuclearhot
beer
o
long
story
short
between
two
people
who
love
spicy
food
we
had
to
drainpour
this
i
dont
drainpour
often
and
i
sure
as
shit
dont
drainpour
20
bottles
either
stone
is
such
a
frustrating
brewery
their
main
line
is
rocksolid
and
some
of
their
beers
are
fantastic
their
15th
anny
and
ruinten
are
among
my
favorite
beers
ever
but
then
you
get
mediocrity
like
the
16th
anny
and
even
worse
unmitigated
crap
like
this
i
dont
even
feel
like
making
a
cute
pun
about
this
being
punishment
to
drink
this
just
plain
sucks
i
would
suggest
this
to
a
pepper
fiend
but
i
would
let
them
know
that
my
opinion
this
did
not
have
any
beer
aspects
aside
from
alcohol
habanero
100
to
the
max
like
fumy
fruity
greatness
extracted
from
chiles
the
base
beer
is
gone
but
this
reinvents
chili
beer
and
12
abv
is
a
joke
in
this
case
if
you
have
ever
sliced
habaneros
try
this
beer
took
off
some
overall
points
because
this
could
have
been
a
gem
if
there
was
any
bourbon
double
bastard
left
to
be
found
if
you
like
habaneros
try
these
beers
overall
i
could
have
handled
jalapenos
but
when
you
get
into
nagas
caribbean
red
hots
moruga
scorpions
and
fatilis
i
am
overwhelmed
i
dont
know
anything
about
any
of
them
but
they
are
in
the
habanero
category
to
me
if
not
hotter
o
whew
seriously
seriously
hot
beer
i
doubt
more
than
5
of
the
population
could
even
make
it
through
this
bottle
this
is
one
step
away
from
drinking
from
a
bottle
of
hot
sauce
i
gave
it
a
good
score
because
it
does
what
it
came
to
do
hell
its
called
punishment
they
were
not
kidding
i
didnt
score
the
taste
that
great
because
it
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
a
beer
its
just
alcoholic
hot
sauce
but
who
cares
listen
guy
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
besides
crime
do
not
waste
your
money
sobriety
or
time
the
smell
made
me
want
to
throw
up
my
3
friends
and
i
could
not
drink
more
than
a
sip
each
we
poured
ours
out
and
drank
a
founders
backwoods
bastard
to
bring
our
palates
back
if
you
want
a
firebomb
beerdrinking
experience
or
you
like
extreme
beers
with
high
abv
give
it
a
try
if
your
budget
doesnt
allow
for
a
very
pricey
purchase
you
neednt
worry
to
pass
it
over
o
about
the
only
positive
aspect
would
be
to
use
this
in
chili
or
some
other
dish
that
can
utilize
both
the
beer
and
spice
theres
really
no
reason
for
a
beer
to
be
this
hot
this
abrasive
this
defiant
yet
it
does
as
i
have
never
had
a
beer
that
rivals
the
heat
that
was
expressed
here
it
has
support
balance
and
resonance
as
abrasive
as
it
may
seem
this
beer
simply
works
okay
as
a
chili
pepper
beer
this
is
the
best
of
the
best
it
already
starts
with
a
great
stone
base
and
the
bottle
design
just
enticesintimidates
you
before
you
drink
it
then
once
you
uncork
it
this
overwhelming
amazing
chili
pepper
smell
comes
creeping
out
of
the
bottle
letting
you
know
what
youre
getting
yourself
into
your
pour
it
out
and
you
can
see
little
chili
pepper
residue
in
the
brew
and
the
smell
really
intensifies
the
moment
you
drink
it
those
peppers
just
kick
your
ass
but
in
a
really
delicious
way
i
recommend
the
sip
not
the
gulp
overall
i
cant
understand
how
someone
who
would
spend
the
money
to
buy
this
would
rank
it
low
youre
upset
a
spicy
beer
is
spicy
deal
with
it
its
delicious
and
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
share
with
friends
overall
good
god
i
dont
hate
this
but
i
must
say
why
ruin
barrel
aged
double
bastard
with
all
these
peppers
and
also
this
was
ridiculously
priced
at
24
i
love
stone
didnt
think
twice
about
buying
this
but
i
feel
really
ripped
off
this
isnt
even
a
22oz
bottle
theres
no
balance
just
the
crushing
pepper
kick
its
worth
a
sip
make
sure
you
share
this
bottle
with
friends
cause
theres
no
way
you
can
finish
the
whole
bottle
500
ml
bottle
poured
into
small
snifter
no
head
very
little
clear
lacing
cloudy
copper
body
aroma
includes
notes
of
cucumber
fresh
peppers
cayenne
sriracha
taste
is
all
heat
tongue
tingling
lip
numbing
hard
to
pick
up
other
flavors
beyond
the
heat
but
i
feel
like
my
taste
buds
are
stimulated
and
now
i
will
probably
enjoy
my
dinner
even
more
pairs
well
with
chicken
wings
unique
experience
share
with
friends
because
i
dont
think
you
should
drink
more
than
a
few
ounces
this
beer
delivers
on
its
promises
and
after
all
isnt
that
all
you
can
ask
for
in
a
beer
or
any
other
consumer
good
smells
hot
brewed
with
habeneros
and
ghost
chilies
tastes
sweet
hoppy
and
has
a
definite
chili
flavor
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
with
a
very
spicy
kick
in
the
back
of
the
throat
looks
dark
golden
brown
happy
to
tried
both
crime
and
punishment
but
happier
that
i
wont
be
trying
them
again
o
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
love
double
bastard
bourbon
and
spicy
beers
but
this
is
overkill
i
wanted
to
enjoy
the
beers
flavors
but
my
mouth
was
too
burnt
up
to
enjoy
any
of
this
20
drain
pour
o
a
rather
enjoyable
if
somewhat
masochistic
brew
from
stone
you
will
not
want
to
finish
a
bottle
on
your
own
i
had
about
4
ounces
and
was
done
i
could
feel
the
capsaicin
burn
from
my
mouth
all
the
way
down
into
my
stomach
and
every
burp
tasted
like
jalapeño
pizza
afterwards
id
honestly
recommend
anyone
try
this
beer
just
dont
focus
too
much
on
the
heat
and
its
pretty
damn
good
unless
you
are
really
into
punishment
take
a
pass
on
on
this
one
overall
its
not
undrinkable
but
this
is
about
a
3
or
4
ounce
maximum
per
serving
the
double
bastard
accents
get
lost
which
holds
this
brew
back
for
me
comes
off
as
a
barrel
aged
pepper
brew
burns
the
palate
and
through
but
is
no
doubt
a
unique
brew
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
this
is
about
the
most
fitting
name
possible
for
a
beer
ever
it
is
pungent
and
spicy
to
the
point
where
its
nearly
imposdible
to
enjoy
an
absolute
endorphin
rush
i
am
afraid
of
how
bad
this
is
going
to
feel
tomorrow
sidebar
item
ive
had
this
on
tap
2
or
so
yeard
ago
so
i
knew
just
how
bad
this
was
going
to
be
dont
try
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
by
yourself
its
a
dumb
idea
this
beer
is
highly
recommended
as
a
gag
gift
and
nothing
more
what
a
waste
of
barrel
aged
double
bastard
this
was
the
most
difficult
beer
drinking
experience
of
my
life
the
first
sip
was
ok
for
a
second
and
then
the
intense
pepper
flavor
destroys
your
taste
buds
why
would
you
barrel
age
and
pepper
load
a
good
beer
in
its
own
right
i
paid
21
for
this
bottle
and
my
best
friend
in
the
world
paid
21
for
the
second
worst
beer
of
my
life
crime
we
drank
them
in
one
sitting
together
and
they
were
almost
impossible
to
finish
if
i
wasnt
a
border
line
alcoholic
i
would
have
poured
them
down
the
drain
i
sucked
it
up
and
drank
both
my
portion
and
my
friend
johnjays
thanks
a
lot
stone
brewing
this
one
will
haunt
me
pours
a
murky
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
pepper
jack
cheese
and
chile
pepper
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
chile
pepper
and
chile
pepper
juice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
high
amount
of
chile
heat
that
lingers
in
the
throat
long
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
interesting
with
what
exactly
is
in
it
but
pretty
much
a
novelty
in
my
opinion
ultra
high
marks
for
the
peppers
if
it
werent
muddled
with
all
the
other
stuff
that
makes
bastard
beer
what
it
is
what
this
turned
into
was
an
ultraexpensive
novelty
if
given
the
choice
id
drink
crime
before
drinking
punishment
this
really
is
punishment
if
not
different
from
the
mold
its
both
a
fun
and
horrifying
experience
this
could
be
great
used
in
cooking
but
really
pushing
it
when
it
comes
towards
human
consumption
drinkability
if
youre
coming
in
expecting
brandy
barrelaged
double
bastard
with
a
hint
of
serrano
youll
be
disappointed
i
had
no
idea
the
serranos
would
play
such
a
huge
role
but
as
a
hot
sauce
junkie
i
couldnt
help
but
love
this
one
greg
if
youre
having
trouble
selling
this
stuff
shoot
me
a
bm
this
is
the
best
chile
beer
ive
ever
had
d
this
was
pretty
tough
to
drink
i
would
say
even
if
youre
a
big
chile
beer
fan
this
would
be
painful
overall
i
appreciate
two
new
stone
beers
but
the
name
of
this
one
is
fitting
poured
a
brass
color
with
a
thinner
white
head
atop
light
chili
notes
along
with
some
leafy
hops
and
caramel
flavors
of
the
chili
hit
in
the
throat
but
they
are
not
overly
bigjust
a
nice
subtle
burn
with
a
smattering
of
hops
more
tame
than
many
other
chili
beers
wich
sometimes
can
be
a
good
thing
ive
had
each
batch
and
it
varies
this
was
the
first
batch
the
second
batch
was
sweet
and
peppery
no
heat
the
third
was
less
hot
than
the
first
but
the
head
built
on
you
the
same
way
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
very
little
head
the
nose
offers
very
mild
hops
and
a
hint
of
habanero
first
sip
is
a
little
disappointing
theres
not
really
much
to
offer
at
first
it
seems
like
just
a
lackluster
pale
ale
a
few
more
sips
begin
to
reveal
the
subtleties
the
peppers
begin
to
come
through
on
the
finish
and
after
a
few
sips
one
can
really
begin
to
enjoy
some
spice
this
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
crisp
this
is
nice
change
of
pace
from
your
usual
pale
ale
if
you
enjoy
spicy
food
a
unique
interesting
beer
i
enjoy
beers
with
a
complex
hint
of
spices
especially
in
the
winter
time
however
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
can
recall
trying
that
blended
peppers
into
the
mix
i
was
pleased
by
the
careful
balance
triangle
brewing
achieved
a
nice
smoky
hop
aroma
with
subtle
habanero
pepper
but
also
hints
of
some
other
spices
the
heat
of
the
habanero
was
just
enough
to
enjoy
creeping
in
as
you
swallowed
the
drink
giving
you
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
if
you
like
spicy
food
then
there
is
a
good
chance
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
serving
type
bottle
holy
shit
no
joke
with
the
chilis
this
beer
is
spicy
and
offers
a
lot
of
the
chili
fruitiness
and
ive
always
craved
from
a
chili
beer
quite
daring
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
i
get
green
pepper
on
the
nose
and
more
chilies
and
peppers
on
the
palate
chili
pepper
level
is
just
about
right
here
you
dont
have
to
search
for
it
and
it
doesnt
blow
up
your
taste
buds
as
a
chili
head
who
enjoys
moderate
head
this
one
was
about
spot
on
my
nonchili
head
wife
felt
about
the
same
worth
a
try
especially
if
ya
like
the
style
worth
a
try
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
drinkable
for
a
chili
beerit
had
lots
of
pepper
aromas
and
flavors
but
the
spiceness
wast
that
strong
it
would
pair
well
with
mexican
food
such
as
tortilla
chips
and
salsa
pale
yellow
in
color
pure
white
thin
head
with
a
slight
lace
left
behind
the
first
thing
that
stands
out
is
the
real
true
pepper
smell
delicious
the
first
taste
is
very
light
and
pilsnery
followed
by
a
very
real
excellent
pepper
flavor
not
overpoweringly
so
and
not
overly
hot
mouthfeel
is
i
guess
a
bit
watery
but
not
off
putting
overall
a
really
nice
chili
beer
goes
well
with
pizza
we
want
to
use
this
for
cooking
maybe
chicken
breasts
or
sausages
oa
bad
avoidable
beer
unless
you
think
youd
like
it
that
being
said
a
major
avoid
for
me
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
retention
just
leaves
behind
a
thin
film
over
the
beer
the
lacing
in
very
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
definitely
has
pepper
on
the
nose
good
amount
of
them
it
also
has
a
slight
smokiness
to
it
along
with
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
sweet
for
a
few
seconds
right
off
the
first
sip
then
the
peppers
come
in
there
is
a
good
amount
of
heat
for
a
minute
or
two
then
it
fades
the
finish
is
kind
of
on
the
sweeter
side
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
to
it
overall
its
actually
a
pretty
good
chile
beer
the
heat
comes
in
strong
but
doesnt
make
you
wanna
die
it
tingles
and
then
fades
nicely
allowing
you
to
go
back
for
another
sip
its
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
but
having
a
single
glass
of
it
was
enjoyable
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
razor
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
yet
provides
streaky
lacing
the
beer
was
tapserved
cold
but
still
has
a
sweet
jalapeño
spiciness
in
the
nose
its
exactly
the
nose
i
was
looking
for
which
is
a
relief
in
comparison
to
the
intense
chilies
in
ghostface
the
taste
is
outstanding
and
does
its
part
highlighting
the
chili
while
also
continuing
to
be
smooth
and
drinkable
there
is
a
light
burn
on
the
back
of
my
palate
but
it
doesnt
prevent
you
from
taking
your
next
sip
i
think
they
nailed
this
beer
and
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
my
advice
would
be
to
use
some
smoked
chilies
to
bring
out
even
more
smoothness
frankly
the
jalapeño
beer
is
a
little
overdone
and
could
stand
a
facelift
smells
a
bit
spicy
nothing
too
crazy
though
taste
is
medium
bodied
a
nice
balanced
ale
upfront
with
some
slight
pepper
flavors
once
you
swallow
the
spiciness
kicks
in
and
is
actually
much
hotter
than
i
would
have
expected
that
being
said
its
a
good
spiciness
and
actually
rounds
out
the
beer
pretty
well
might
be
tough
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
definitely
worth
a
try
and
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
had
overall
for
the
style
this
is
well
done
one
glass
is
all
you
can
drink
solo
but
with
some
spicy
tacos
or
some
gumbo
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
slight
bit
of
pepper
way
in
the
back
but
it
was
not
dominating
by
any
means
the
initial
sip
was
a
work
of
art
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
sugar
roll
across
the
tongue
with
a
lively
and
well
carbonated
feel
that
really
lets
the
flavor
pop
moving
through
you
start
to
feel
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
a
warming
in
the
throat
and
a
fire
in
the
belly
subtly
the
chili
comes
through
warming
you
as
it
goes
but
by
no
means
is
this
too
big
this
is
perfectly
blended
in
the
flavor
rising
subtly
to
a
crescendo
that
then
backs
down
as
easy
as
it
came
up
picked
this
up
at
beers
of
the
world
in
henrietta
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
clear
dull
light
goden
with
a
bit
of
orange
tingea
thin
wispy
white
head
atop
aromas
are
very
light
with
biscuit
dough
a
tinge
of
hard
waterthere
is
a
nice
sweet
biscuit
dough
malt
base
on
the
palatethe
chilis
come
in
the
back
end
and
hit
the
throat
not
as
assertive
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
its
malt
profile
is
nice
the
pepper
is
enjoyable
unlike
some
other
pepper
beers
ive
had
d
fantastic
for
a
chili
beer
i
would
take
this
in
volume
to
a
summer
bbq
very
very
yummy
in
the
end
theres
almost
not
enough
praise
i
can
give
this
perfect
gem
of
a
beer
amazing
cheers
ive
only
had
2
chile
beers
in
my
life
this
and
the
rogue
and
i
really
enjoy
the
style
but
this
is
definatly
the
better
of
the
2
d
its
a
novelty
beer
that
goes
better
with
food
rather
than
on
its
own
overall
this
was
a
great
tasting
well
balanced
beer
for
the
style
unlike
the
novelty
chile
beers
you
might
be
used
to
seeing
my
mouth
is
on
fire
there
is
little
carbonation
but
holds
up
well
and
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
how
spicy
and
peppery
as
chiles
it
is
clearly
not
a
session
beer
however
if
i
were
eating
a
lot
of
mexican
or
spicy
italian
food
as
i
am
about
to
i
would
drink
several
throughout
the
meal
ive
had
quite
a
few
chili
peppercorn
beers
and
this
the
best
yet
fantastic
execution
i
want
more
all
in
all
this
was
a
unique
beer
not
amazing
but
if
youre
looking
to
try
something
different
then
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
brew
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
brew
this
one
might
not
be
for
you
not
sure
i
understand
the
name
but
those
dogs
on
the
bottle
do
look
pretty
fierce
the
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
steadfast
white
foam
the
nose
is
rather
heavy
on
the
pepper
showcasing
both
its
inherent
heat
and
even
deeper
chlorophyll
levels
some
vague
wheat
and
extremely
light
citrus
notes
lie
submissive
in
the
background
i
fear
for
their
safety
the
taste
immediately
begins
as
a
normal
light
lagerish
brew
but
quickly
a
decent
amount
of
peppers
comes
in
washing
oer
all
and
staying
through
the
finish
when
a
bit
more
of
that
lager
comes
in
vague
floral
hops
light
wheat
and
corn
and
whatnot
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
drying
feel
and
finish
overall
a
nice
chile
beer
a
hulluva
lot
better
than
most
of
its
competitors
though
i
think
that
may
go
without
saying
tastes
bright
pepper
flavor
with
mild
but
dancing
pepper
sting
malt
sweet
is
well
balanced
to
the
pepper
flavor
and
heat
not
much
flavor
in
the
way
of
malt
and
no
hop
flavor
or
bitter
than
i
can
detect
as
far
as
pepper
beers
go
this
is
quality
stuff
medium
body
with
a
nice
dextrinous
quality
that
holds
both
the
malt
sweet
and
pepper
sting
me
likey
give
me
more
d
horseheads
has
produced
a
style
that
is
seldom
dominating
the
scenes
look
you
need
to
try
this
brew
and
appreciate
what
the
crafter
is
trying
to
produce
as
i
am
a
fan
of
the
spices
i
will
give
credit
to
this
concept
great
job
horseheads
d
i
like
hot
and
i
like
horseheads
so
this
beer
will
be
purchased
again
not
a
style
i
rush
out
for
but
a
great
curve
ball
when
i
want
something
different
quite
an
interesting
brew
i
bet
this
would
be
killer
with
a
bowl
of
chili
the
more
you
drink
the
warmer
it
gets
the
simplicity
is
precisely
what
makes
this
an
easy
beer
to
consume
while
it
does
improve
with
a
little
warmth
hotjalaheim
is
really
an
all
purpose
beer
best
as
a
refresher
pretty
drinkable
a
really
great
chile
beer
overall
even
if
the
heat
is
not
as
intense
as
a
hardcore
heat
guy
like
me
would
like
f
spicy
and
the
spiciness
seems
to
linger
a
bit
more
of
the
sweet
malts
and
lager
flavors
lingering
wheat
pepper
and
a
little
honey
lingering
for
a
while
i
would
of
enjoyed
this
more
if
i
was
eating
something
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
to
it
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
without
being
too
outrageous
cave
creek
thanks
indiapaleale
this
one
isnt
half
bad
the
heat
wasnt
overwhelming
i
could
see
me
enjoying
these
if
i
were
closer
to
the
brewery
horseheads
hotjalaheim
is
a
pretty
clear
lively
golden
beer
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
has
notes
of
corn
jalapeno
dms
and
a
little
toasty
malt
it
has
a
foamy
medium
body
thats
pretty
smooth
with
a
quick
finish
thats
a
bit
scratchy
its
a
touch
sweet
and
a
touch
bitter
chocolate
is
detected
theres
a
nice
twang
and
spice
from
the
peppers
its
a
little
corny
this
is
more
complex
than
i
expected
its
kind
of
like
drinking
a
burrito
i
didnt
figure
out
that
there
were
anaheims
in
it
until
i
just
about
finished
the
bottle
now
it
all
makes
sense
d
best
chili
beer
yet
thanks
to
beertruth
for
picking
this
up
for
me
and
for
number1bum
for
muling
it
back
from
syracuse
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
hazed
golden
yellow
color
with
about
an
inch
of
off
white
foam
no
lacing
to
speak
of
here
nose
is
of
green
pepper
skins
toasted
malt
slightly
sweet
flavors
consist
of
fresh
green
peppers
jalapeno
peppers
nice
amount
of
heat
but
by
no
means
overpowering
the
heat
comes
at
your
mouth
tongue
and
throat
gradually
after
each
sip
and
lingers
until
you
take
another
pull
from
the
glass
amply
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
a
pretty
decent
chile
beer
with
an
emphasis
on
fresh
raw
peppers
d
if
you
dont
like
spicy
food
or
jalapeños
then
this
beer
is
not
for
you
this
is
a
mildly
spicy
tribute
to
the
beauty
that
is
the
pepper
not
something
i
would
drink
everyday
but
undoubtedly
this
is
the
best
chili
beer
ive
had
yet
bottle
from
village
beer
merchant
quite
lagerish
initially
with
peppers
in
the
finish
as
i
got
through
most
of
the
bottle
the
peppers
build
up
and
its
more
refreshing
grows
on
you
have
liked
more
spicey
bolder
of
this
variety
and
this
was
not
bad
drinkablity
is
good
d
while
this
is
a
pretty
onedimensional
beer
it
is
welldone
and
not
overly
hot
or
spicy
at
all
rendering
this
as
quite
drinkable
overall
the
pepper
flavor
is
not
overbearing
at
all
dnice
stuff
not
hot
light
and
easy
to
drink
this
brew
is
a
nice
accompanying
beer
with
food
we
had
it
with
franks
and
beans
and
it
went
great
d
a
great
accompaniment
to
beans
and
weenies
the
ale
is
a
pretty
good
brew
that
smells
great
d
the
most
drinkable
chilli
beer
i
have
ever
had
glad
we
had
alot
of
heads
to
split
the
bottle
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
pretty
drinkable
with
that
said
i
think
chile
beers
are
food
beers
for
the
most
part
theyre
great
with
a
sandwich
or
pizza
or
anything
that
could
be
spiced
up
a
bit
the
peppers
burn
the
throat
a
little
but
in
a
good
way
this
beer
is
pure
liquid
nachos
brother
no
way
around
it
i
like
it
truly
unique
drinkability
definitley
the
best
tasting
chili
beer
ive
had
but
honestly
it
was
slightly
tough
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
it
has
just
enough
capsicum
to
really
warm
the
throat
after
about
half
the
glass
if
you
have
heartburn
stay
away
from
this
brew
lol
if
you
love
chili
beers
you
have
to
seek
this
one
out
thanks
adam
a
real
interesting
brew
i
finished
the
bomber
i
think
that
was
enough
for
one
sitting
but
i
will
look
for
one
in
the
future
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
solid
golden
ale
base
which
is
light
and
full
of
pale
malts
but
it
also
has
a
semiaggressive
pepper
aroma
jalapeno
peppers
are
quite
noticeable
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
flavor
with
little
to
no
hop
character
along
with
a
hot
peppery
finish
it
says
that
its
made
with
jalapeno
and
anaheim
peppers
its
mildly
spicey
at
first
then
it
bites
you
good
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
inspired
by
a
recent
trip
to
the
gabf
chili
beers
rock
the
colorado
area
and
now
thanks
to
these
guys
they
rock
ny
as
well
malt
sweetness
dominates
things
a
little
too
much
whats
really
missing
is
any
significant
chili
pepper
heat
or
flavor
what
does
appear
is
so
faint
and
so
far
into
the
background
as
to
be
nearly
invisible
the
beer
comes
across
rather
onedimensional
and
lacks
balance
depth
and
complexity
my
initial
impression
to
this
beer
was
a
chili
tripel
what
really
why
after
having
tried
it
a
couple
of
times
that
continues
to
be
my
opinion
on
it
interesting
idea
and
one
that
could
work
provided
the
right
food
pairing
but
overall
its
simply
a
regrettable
offering
the
departure
from
stylistic
guidelines
doesnt
bother
me
fact
is
this
recipe
just
plain
isnt
very
good
o
i
like
the
idea
but
i
found
that
this
tasted
like
a
poorly
made
dipa
infused
with
chile
rather
than
a
tripel
infused
with
chile
overall
a
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
big
chile
beer
highly
recommended
for
some
innovation
and
good
flavor
profiles
with
the
striking
contrast
between
a
spicy
tripel
and
the
raw
heat
of
chiles
overall
interesting
idea
and
i
do
like
the
chile
combination
with
some
beer
styles
but
the
tripel
isnt
one
of
them
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
wasnt
very
strong
with
pepper
at
all
the
smell
was
mostly
like
any
other
tripel
out
there
really
the
taste
of
this
was
rather
mild
i
wasnt
really
picking
but
much
spice
at
all
in
this
beer
the
flavors
of
grains
and
bready
belgian
yeast
were
prominent
in
this
one
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
but
i
felt
like
it
was
a
little
on
the
flat
side
overall
this
beer
wasnt
overly
impressive
to
me
i
felt
as
though
it
needed
something
a
little
more
to
put
it
at
a
better
level
for
me
it
was
decent
but
wouldnt
buy
it
again
upon
hearing
of
this
beers
existence
i
had
to
track
it
down
and
try
it
a
chile
tripel
lets
dance
it
pours
a
partly
cloudy
sunrise
amber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
black
pepper
light
white
bread
light
clove
and
the
lightest
possible
kiss
of
mild
caramel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
now
the
peppers
come
in
close
to
the
finish
providing
some
spice
and
a
decently
small
bit
of
heat
honestly
the
peppers
really
bring
this
thing
together
rescuing
it
from
general
mediocrity
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
an
interesting
beer
one
that
doesnt
necessarily
win
on
all
accounts
but
it
does
generally
satisfy
o
quite
special
taste
to
it
but
still
very
drinkable
nice
one
to
open
an
evening
with
i
havent
really
tasted
anything
like
this
one
before
the
chilis
in
this
beer
show
up
late
to
the
game
only
in
the
dry
finish
do
i
get
them
the
spice
is
real
though
the
forward
of
the
beer
is
a
little
boring
not
great
just
ok
i
dont
hate
it
i
just
dont
understand
it
or
care
enough
to
drink
it
again
reveal
wow
midtfyns
bryghus
chili
tripel
so
far
off
i
guess
chili
is
what
i
thought
the
booze
was
dont
get
anything
remotely
resembling
a
tripel
in
this
one
o
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tried
but
its
certainly
forgettable
i
let
this
warm
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
poured
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
quickly
settled
down
to
a
small
island
and
no
lace
color
is
an
orange
honey
medium
dark
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
yeast
malt
bandages
toffee
astringent
minerals
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
yet
doesnt
yield
the
chili
straight
up
the
bandages
are
prominant
along
with
sweetness
chili
heat
comes
in
quite
mild
later
body
is
ok
and
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
even
with
the
heat
not
that
good
dont
want
any
more
cook
with
it
o
this
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
the
chile
works
quite
well
to
complement
the
style
somebody
really
thought
the
taste
combination
through
and
it
shows
well
done
overall
very
special
brew
nice
m
barely
less
than
medium
bodied
smooth
chilies
and
tripels
two
of
our
favorites
score
crackling
lace
cloudy
amber
color
peppery
aroma
from
the
alcohol
and
chili
pepper
also
with
kiwi
and
taffy
crisp
and
slick
medium
body
the
caramel
maltiness
fades
the
chili
heat
grows
to
an
even
warmth
a
little
chewy
malt
taffy
and
dried
grass
light
hop
bitterness
alcohol
is
strong
but
not
reckless
finishes
with
the
chili
warmth
alcohol
vapor
and
some
malt
remnants
at
first
the
taste
buds
ask
where
the
chili
is
but
sip
after
sip
it
becomes
more
prevalenta
darker
tripel
thats
more
refined
than
extreme
an
exciting
ride
very
unique
ill
just
leave
it
at
that
o
this
beer
is
awesome
i
remember
having
this
last
year
and
i
do
not
remember
it
being
so
spicy
i
love
how
it
sneaks
up
on
you
with
the
peppers
not
really
being
evident
in
the
aroma
its
definitely
a
beast
of
a
chile
beer
a
musttry
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
as
a
chili
beer
and
as
a
brown
ale
the
base
showed
through
while
providing
heat
which
is
definitely
the
byproduct
of
the
dryhopping
technique
used
with
the
peppers
a
must
try
for
any
chili
beer
fan
o
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
but
be
warned
its
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
in
reading
the
other
reviews
on
ba
which
are
all
from
the
old
batch
im
inclined
to
think
theyve
made
some
significant
changes
because
the
pepper
notes
are
huge
in
this
one
if
spicy
isnt
your
thing
stay
away
but
if
you
love
hot
peppers
then
this
beer
is
for
you
o
not
too
bold
and
outrageous
with
the
pepper
but
a
perfect
amount
that
allows
the
full
profile
of
the
beer
to
be
tasted
and
enjoyed
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
touch
over
mediumbodied
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
really
enjoyable
beer
id
be
curious
to
try
it
with
more
peppers
speaking
to
jamie
at
coast
she
informed
me
that
dave
and
mikey
want
to
do
a
version
with
a
ton
more
chilies
heres
hoping
served
from
bottle
into
a
coast
willi
poured
a
dark
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
subtle
citrus
subtle
smoke
and
peppers
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
toasted
malt
citrus
hop
subtle
dark
chocolate
subtle
smokiness
and
jalapeño
sweetnessspiciness
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
citrus
aspect
i
picked
up
on
this
one
was
really
quite
nice
and
a
pleasant
surprise
it
really
mixed
well
with
the
rest
of
the
notes
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
there
was
a
nice
backbone
for
the
style
present
and
the
peppers
were
definitely
out
in
force
as
they
brought
a
nice
spicy
followthrough
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
opportunity
another
winner
from
the
brewery
that
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
holy
cow
spicy
peanuts
galore
not
something
i
could
hang
with
but
they
do
a
great
job
of
capturing
the
flavor
sweet
peanuts
on
the
nose
initial
taste
is
exactly
that
sweet
peanut
sauce
then
the
spice
hits
you
fairly
hot
but
you
wont
be
on
the
ground
crying
30
minutes
later
very
bizarre
flavor
for
a
beer
but
they
certainly
nailed
it
different
and
not
the
best
peanut
butter
beer
ive
had
but
not
that
bad
either
i
like
the
attempt
at
something
different
and
i
never
thought
id
say
this
but
i
wish
the
peppers
were
kicked
up
a
notch
or
two
solid
but
something
id
probably
pass
up
if
i
saw
it
again
had
this
one
at
the
source
on
a
past
ticking
trip
to
asheville
served
from
tap
into
a
thirsty
monk
shaker
poured
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
jalepano
smoke
earth
and
earth
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
jalepano
subtle
smoke
earth
hop
and
a
spicy
followthrough
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
had
this
one
earlier
in
the
day
from
a
tap
elsewhere
and
there
was
really
no
difference
between
the
two
so
if
you
find
that
you
might
like
this
one
it
doesnt
really
matter
where
you
get
it
as
it
is
pretty
much
the
same
brew
amber
pour
bordering
on
a
light
brown
with
a
smooth
even
and
small
head
that
did
its
best
to
not
really
fade
that
much
at
all
aroma
is
lots
of
earth
grains
light
hops
and
a
touch
of
rye
like
spice
not
much
pepper
at
all
in
the
aroma
this
comes
much
later
as
you
take
a
sip
it
has
all
the
marks
of
a
nicely
done
esb
or
amber
but
gives
you
that
nice
kick
of
chili
pepper
in
the
finish
that
lets
you
know
its
there
o
excellent
use
of
chili
to
create
a
very
distinctive
beer
that
goes
well
with
some
foods
certainly
worked
well
with
my
veggie
lasagna
its
an
extreme
beer
in
that
it
far
from
a
standard
ale
in
flavor
or
aroma
but
it
is
not
challenging
assuming
one
likes
the
taste
of
chili
peppers
since
the
heat
is
under
control
when
you
first
drink
if
you
get
the
cocoa
but
in
the
following
you
start
getting
more
spice
to
the
taste
pretty
good
beer
has
a
very
nice
hint
of
coconut
at
the
beginning
followed
by
a
spicy
aftertaste
the
spice
is
a
bit
too
much
and
takes
away
from
the
beer
overall
i
am
big
into
large
chile
stouts
now
though
i
will
not
purchase
this
again
it
is
too
thin
and
lacks
flavor
the
chile
and
chocolate
are
there
as
is
a
caramel
sweetness
in
first
sip
there
is
nothing
to
compliment
these
flavors
which
bodes
ill
for
a
larger
8
or
so
and
above
beer
it
is
too
thin
and
their
is
no
bold
roasted
dark
grain
flavor
tasted
more
like
a
low
ibu
amber
with
chocolate
and
chile
flavors
which
i
would
not
of
purchased

d
i
really
love
chile
beers
this
is
a
market
that
needs
expanded
this
is
a
good
one
greatly
enjoyed
this
enjoyed
the
subtle
heat
its
a
little
too
cinnamony
as
it
warms
up
mole
in
a
bottle
the
heat
sneaks
up
on
you
really
captures
the
spirit
of
a
good
mole
sweet
and
spicy
overall
a
pretty
decent
chili
beer
with
no
regrets
i
recommend
sharing
it
with
someone
though
because
the
cinnamon
might
get
a
little
boring
good
stuff
between
the
two
more
widely
available
chilechocolatecinnamon
brews
i
give
the
advantage
to
xocoveza
but
i
enjoy
this
plenty
another
lips
of
faith
winner
beautiful
dark
color
with
a
cinnamon
pepper
smell
smell
lots
of
south
of
the
border
chocolate
taste
up
front
that
lingers
and
eventually
turns
into
a
slow
burn
of
pepper
absolutely
amazing
this
is
an
excellent
spiced
stout
it
leans
a
little
too
heavily
toward
sweetness
and
cinnamon
i
would
like
more
of
a
strong
base
stout
roasted
malt
is
overwhelmed
by
sugar
and
spice
tastes
a
little
artificial
in
doses
amazing
take
on
a
chili
beer
loaded
with
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
cinnamon
and
chilis
dominate
in
both
departments
no
booze
at
all
scary
drinkable
32
oz
growler
fill
is
perfect
delicious
and
different
o
great
chile
beer
balanced
spice
an
interesting
beer
but
not
something
i
would
pick
up
again
the
nose
is
cinnamon
nothing
subtle
about
it
and
quite
nice
taste
is
a
letdown
in
that
whatever
cocoa
is
there
and
its
not
much
is
quickly
overcome
by
the
chile
it
starts
with
the
flavor
found
in
the
skin
if
dried
chile
and
finishes
with
spice
again
not
subtle
it
actually
packs
some
heat
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
alcohol
too
is
covered
up
by
pepper
not
too
much
enjoyable
here
for
me
overall
not
sure
about
this
one
im
not
the
biggest
chili
beer
fan
its
ok
but
not
up
on
a
par
with
my
all
time
favorite
chile
beer
stone
xocoveza
not
sure
if
id
seek
this
out
again
this
grew
in
me
as
i
sipped
it
but
overall
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
i
appreciated
it
and
it
intrigued
me
though
my
girlfriend
liked
it
so
i
can
see
having
another
glass
at
another
time
for
a
change
of
pace
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
review
it
to
the
best
of
my
ability
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
minimal
head
and
spotty
lacing
aroma
hits
you
hard
with
scents
of
cinnamon
roses
and
some
weird
yet
intriguing
other
aroma
that
i
just
cant
figure
out
taste
is
very
bold
like
the
nose
touches
of
wet
cinnamon
and
allspice
are
definitely
present
and
their
is
a
slight
burn
that
i
would
guess
is
a
combination
of
the
alcohol
and
the
ancho
guajillo
and
chipotle
peppers
the
heat
is
not
overbearing
but
you
tend
to
get
more
of
it
on
the
front
end
than
the
back
i
am
getting
very
little
cocoa
out
of
this
this
beer
is
full
of
all
kinds
of
mild
to
moderate
spice
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
less
than
i
would
have
expected
after
the
first
taste
hard
to
tell
how
the
balance
is
because
of
everything
that
is
going
on
but
overall
this
is
the
most
unique
beer
i
have
had
a
sipper
slow
and
steady
lol
what
a
great
flavor
definitely
feel
a
little
heat
after
would
highly
recommend
dark
with
thin
brown
head
subtle
spice
and
chocolate
aroma
taste
is
subtle
too
cocoa
malt
and
hint
of
spice
very
nice
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
overall
an
interesting
one
to
try
but
a
little
too
peppery
and
spiced
for
my
tastes
if
you
like
chili
spice
and
chocolate
porters
this
may
be
for
you
but
if
not
you
may
not
want
to
take
this
on
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
as
a
great
example
of
a
moléstyle
beer
not
something
i
would
want
tastecinnamonchocolate
malt
subtle
chili
pepper
warmth
caramel
subtle
but
complex
lineup
of
flavors
easy
drinking
for
the
strength
overall
a
darned
good
pepper
porter
would
repeat
enjoyed
from
the
bomber
in
a
snifter
during
a
bottle
share
a
truly
unique
porter
poured
a
deep
dark
red
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
dissipated
after
a
couple
of
minutes
nice
lacing
aromas
of
cinnamon
cocoa
powder
with
hints
of
pepper
spices
a
little
worried
at
the
first
sip
that
it
might
be
awful
however
i
am
glad
the
aromas
were
misleading
tastes
of
cocoa
with
a
slight
hint
of
roasted
chilies
cinnamon
and
vanilla
rich
dark
roasted
malts
as
well
the
back
end
is
mainly
dark
roasted
malts
with
cocoa
with
the
roasted
chilies
finishes
both
sweet
and
spicy
great
chile
beer
interesting
beer
to
try
once
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
too
hot
not
enough
chocolate
too
thin
no
aroma
just
not
good
another
drain
pour
from
nb
cheers
this
is
a
unique
brew
they
nailed
the
spicy
aspects
the
spices
arent
overwhelming
but
theyre
clearly
the
star
of
the
show
the
flavors
shine
i
just
wish
it
had
a
better
nose
its
much
better
than
my
numeric
score
might
indicate
ive
had
mole
themed
beers
before
and
loved
them
ive
had
stouts
brewed
on
cocoa
nibs
and
chiles
and
several
of
them
are
among
my
favorites
unfortunately
there
is
nothing
nuanced
about
this
one
and
its
probably
the
final
nail
in
the
coffin
for
me
when
it
comes
to
new
belgium
pours
a
reddish
dark
brown
smells
of
cinnamon
malty
capsaicin
and
hot
chocolate
tastes
peppery
light
heat
in
the
throat
malty
milk
chocolate
and
astringence
medium
light
body
chocolate
malt
and
chili
heat
in
the
aftertaste
o
i
intend
to
get
a
bomber
of
this
superb
brew
a
great
dessert
beer
and
one
to
share
with
friends
spicyness
of
peppers
plays
nicely
into
the
warming
9
abv
of
the
beer
the
beer
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
variety
of
flavors
presented
the
nose
reminisent
of
a
spicy
cinnamon
cupcake
overall
the
beer
is
on
the
sweet
side
cinnamon
takes
over
the
beer
and
the
sweetness
of
the
ceylon
mexican
cinnamon
also
plays
into
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
aftertaste
killed
this
beer
for
me
i
could
taste
the
cinnamonchili
blend
several
hours
and
two
meals
later
overall
a
well
executed
chili
beer
the
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
nibs
act
as
a
nice
supporting
cast
to
the
bold
smokiness
and
heat
from
the
peppers
worth
a
go
if
your
seeking
some
heat
in
your
brew
i
am
a
beautiful
person
i
am
trying
to
get
a
chance
to
win
the
game
nice
smooth
stout
not
real
heavy
has
a
cinnamon
flavor
with
some
heat
i
got
this
as
a
gift
it
was
spicy
on
the
backside
and
definitely
a
beer
you
sip
on
the
pepper
is
overwhelming
not
as
good
as
stones
version
excellent
mouth
feel
the
chilies
dont
over
the
layers
of
flavor
toffee
slight
coffee
and
mild
chocolate
comes
in
the
chilies
give
the
perfect
kick
pretty
outstanding
balance
of
heat
via
peppers
and
cocoa
just
a
perfect
snowy
weather
beer
o
im
happy
to
see
this
one
back
again
well
done
spice
very
cool
i
would
say
unique
but
this
seems
to
be
the
trend
now
but
well
done
none
the
less
i
may
be
biased
in
this
review
i
had
this
brew
gabf
week
in
2012
in
nbs
private
tasting
room
they
served
it
with
fresh
locally
made
belgian
waffles
yes
the
perfect
pairing
i
got
to
meet
many
of
their
brewers
and
spent
most
of
a
friday
sampling
oddities
along
with
felix
and
oscar
from
their
oak
foeders
the
new
release
is
still
great
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
great
medium
brown
lacing
the
aroma
is
chocolate
cinnamon
smoke
and
malt
the
taste
is
very
balanced
and
dry
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
very
little
heat
the
chipotle
peppers
contribute
smoke
and
the
cinnamon
punches
up
the
round
maltiness
mouth
feel
is
perfect
between
a
dry
and
oatmeal
stout
there
is
a
breadlike
character
to
this
beer
however
it
doesnt
scream
fat
tire
yeast
like
some
of
their
other
brews
like
ranger
ect
very
little
hop
character
bitterness
seems
to
come
more
from
the
cinnamon
than
the
hops
but
my
guess
is
its
hopped
with
low
alpha
english
hops
the
beer
was
out
of
production
for
several
years
it
tastes
as
good
as
i
remember
i
highly
recommend
it
ive
attempted
to
recreate
it
on
a
home
brew
scale
but
i
always
miss
it
slightly
thank
you
new
belgium
for
bringing
it
back
o
a
little
disappointing
aromas
but
tasty
brew
easy
drinking
im
sure
ive
had
molé
at
some
point
in
my
south
of
the
border
again
the
one
along
the
49th
parallel
mexican
restaurant
forays
over
the
years
but
my
impression
of
it
is
more
academic
than
anything
anyways
cocoa
molé
does
well
by
the
textbook
and
the
tastebuds
spicy
but
not
too
much
yknow
the
heat
deftly
countered
by
a
cocoadriven
malt
sweetness
the
only
real
question
is
that
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
18proof
booze
ill
have
to
get
back
to
yall
on
that
one
prost
22

2015
release
drank
in
feb
2015
sweet
then
spicy
im
a
sucker
for
peppery
or
smoky
porters
mexican
food
and
spicy
foods
so
that
is
part
of
my
affinity
very
smooth
and
as
good
as
i
remember
it
from
the
last
release
a
few
years
ago
having
had
other
hot
spiced
beer
this
one
stands
out
in
my
opinion
pours
a
very
dark
brown
wtih
the
spices
coming
to
the
forefront
of
the
smell
the
taste
brings
some
warming
heat
but
there
is
also
a
sweetness
that
is
present
the
heat
of
the
spice
lasts
well
into
the
next
sip
overall
a
nice
beer
taste
is
almost
adjunctlike
but
the
level
of
flavor
competes
with
that
profile
definitely
can
taste
some
chile
and
it
adds
to
the
flavor
profile
kind
of
chocolatey
carbonation
appears
although
there
are
no
bubbles
could
it
be
the
heat
from
the
chile
great
beer
but
thin
if
you
are
like
me
and
have
a
weakness
for
authentic
mexican
cuisine
as
well
as
a
finelycrafted
beer
this
porter
is
a
love
letter
to
you
want
more
of
everything
except
cinnamon
especially
more
chilies
would
also
like
it
with
more
body
as
a
stout
perhaps
really
enjoyed
this
complex
beer
the
spice
is
mild
but
stands
out
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
overall
an
excellent
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
victory
at
sea
mole
but
still
excellent
a
little
sweeter
than
i
think
it
should
have
been
but
otherwise
great
a
bit
odd
nice
notes
throughout
but
if
there
was
a
sense
of
it
being
a
perfect
example
of
a
style
that
would
be
nice
its
a
little
bit
offkilter
stylistically
too
sweet
for
some
things
and
too
spicy
for
others
still
i
quite
enjoy
it
a
dark
brownblackish
body
bad
lighting
where
i
had
it
with
one
finger
head
that
goes
quick
on
top
of
a
spicy
chili
esque
aroma
though
not
too
dominant
as
the
chocolate
is
real
strong
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
mostly
chocolate
and
chili
but
i
found
a
good
balance
as
the
beer
is
a
sweet
heat
in
other
words
the
chilis
dont
just
add
a
little
spice
to
the
chocolate
and
the
chocolate
isnt
overpowered
and
letting
the
beer
get
too
hot
chewey
bready
fuller
bodied
some
minor
fruit
notes
that
i
cant
really
placed
overall
just
a
really
good
beer
i
really
liked
this
beer
as
it
combined
some
heat
with
some
cocoa
and
cinnamon
everything
works
in
this
experiment
as
the
heat
backed
the
stout
like
beer
and
the
spices
added
some
sweetness
the
mexican
flavour
aspect
is
unique
and
very
cool
i
would
love
to
get
a
bottle
and
pair
it
with
some
mexican
food
this
is
a
lovely
brew
well
rounded
with
a
perfect
balance
of
chili
to
cocoa
to
spice
and
still
stays
a
beer
overall
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
beer
it
was
one
that
was
sitting
in
my
cellar
looking
at
me
for
a
while
but
i
was
never
in
the
mood
to
try
it
finally
broke
it
out
and
happy
i
did
very
complex
very
unique
overall
above
average
to
solid
seems
right
for
the
style
i
would
suggest
you
try
it
if
youre
into
chile
beers
but
it
might
not
be
hot
enough
for
you
weaklings
like
myself
should
probably
give
it
a
pass
o
i
was
not
impressed
the
first
few
sips
but
it
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
ive
had
better
beers
in
this
style
o
a
great
beer
ill
definitely
be
going
back
for
more
ill
say
it
again
this
is
a
slightly
spicy
bottled
churro
loses
something
on
the
taste
as
it
warms
solid
though
this
is
quite
an
interesting
chilechocolate
beer
it
has
some
nice
chile
and
chocolate
flavors
but
neither
are
extreme
i
could
probably
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
hope
new
belgium
makes
more
of
this
especially
when
the
east
coast
brewery
is
up
and
running
oits
a
pretty
decent
chili
beer
ive
had
few
beers
that
can
make
a
good
cocoachili
blend
but
this
is
pretty
close
i
think
they
couldve
had
a
strong
cocoa
flavor
while
keeping
some
aspect
of
pepper
flavor
though
im
glad
the
pepper
was
in
the
nose
o
a
very
interesting
concept
that
id
say
was
executed
successfully
ive
had
decent
pepper
beers
before
but
in
this
case
the
play
between
pepper
and
chocolate
adds
an
extra
dimension
of
interest
overall
considering
this
is
a
brown
ale
and
not
a
stout
with
peppers
like
huna
or
abraxas
this
is
an
awesome
beer
still
has
a
few
years
on
it
if
you
want
who
knows
where
it
will
go
o
appreciate
what
its
trying
to
be
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
much
enjoyed
and
recommended
i
hope
to
have
this
again
but
would
be
hesitant
to
tackle
a
22oz
bomber
by
myself
overall
pretty
good
i
like
the
pepper
heat
its
a
nice
level
that
you
def
know
its
there
but
doesnt
destroy
the
beer
and
even
a
light
pepper
flavor
which
is
nice
the
malts
are
nice
as
well
caramel
mocha
molasses
toasty
bread
crumbs
coffee
cake
etc
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
cocoa
as
it
tasted
more
like
swiss
miss
hot
cocoa
powder
rather
than
cocoa
nibs
and
dark
chocolate
kinda
taste
the
cinnamon
and
other
spices
are
interesting
and
a
nice
addition
but
i
wish
the
cinnamon
in
particular
was
a
little
toned
down
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
probably
the
only
real
gripe
i
have
however
those
are
nit
picking
as
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
all
around
if
you
like
mole
this
is
an
obvious
choice
not
an
everyday
drinker
obviously
but
like
indra
kunindra
a
good
time
if
this
kind
of
thing
is
up
your
alley
if
you
really
like
molé
you
should
really
enjoy
this
beer
o
its
a
weird
beer
not
sure
i
would
order
it
again
nice
dark
carmel
flavors
with
a
slight
hop
tastethe
chilli
blends
nice
with
the
other
spices
looks
good
in
the
glass
went
well
with
with
spice
food
many
beers
at
9
oo
have
an
alcohol
after
taste
this
was
not
evident
in
this
brew
the
nice
thing
about
the
brew
is
the
chilli
is
not
over
powering
just
a
light
after
taste
overall
a
unique
beer
worth
the
try
i
normally
like
all
of
new
belgiums
creations
but
do
not
recommend
this
unless
you
wanna
play
a
joke
on
someone
all
things
considered
cocoa
mole
would
be
better
as
an
imperial
stout
pretty
good
nonetheless
quickly
diminishing
head
translucent
brown
in
appearance
strong
cinnamon
and
baking
spice
flavor
with
a
little
pumpkin
and
a
hint
of
salt
on
the
finish
i
feel
like
it
needs
more
of
a
bittering
hop
presence
decent
beer
if
you
split
three
ways
a
half
pint
is
all
i
need
should
be
released
in
the
fall
it
would
make
for
a
nice
after
dinner
drink
not
my
thing
but
an
unusual
beer
that
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
o
this
beer
is
a
unique
one
with
an
odd
combination
that
works
something
tells
me
ill
have
all
hell
to
pay
tomorrow
after
it
works
through
my
system
looks
like
a
glass
of
dead
beer
thats
been
sitting
out
all
night
which
is
a
downer
but
not
a
deal
killer
as
the
beer
sat
in
the
glass
the
chile
burn
faded
somewhat
i
like
this
finding
a
good
spicy
beer
on
the
open
market
is
not
something
you
come
across
everyday
so
pick
it
up
if
youre
into
something
new
o
this
is
one
hell
of
a
chile
beer
great
combination
of
chile
heat
bitter
cocoa
and
caramel
to
sweeten
it
all
up
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
easily
the
best
crafted
chile
beer
ive
had
by
a
long
shot
m
light
body
moderate
to
high
carbonation
o
overall
this
beer
wasnt
that
bad
but
really
could
use
a
boost
of
appearance
and
aroma
carbonated
like
a
stout
feels
sorta
milky
with
a
dry
finish
o
i
really
like
this
beer
after
the
first
bomber
i
went
and
picked
up
another
hope
to
see
this
again
in
the
future
the
complex
flavors
the
spicyness
of
the
brew
are
a
great
combo
drink
a
tasty
spiced
beer
nicely
balanced
and
well
flavored
not
a
fast
drinker
but
a
nice
sipping
beer
to
say
the
least
id
have
it
again
o
extremely
unique
spicy
cinnamon
and
chocolate
the
peppers
and
heat
really
is
a
wild
combo
for
a
chile
beer
this
one
works
o
great
stuff
here
a
lot
going
on
and
so
much
to
savor
a
fun
oneoff
beer
that
is
a
great
representation
of
this
style
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
brownish
head
a
sweet
cinnamon
aroma
paired
with
somecocoa
roasted
malt
and
some
pepper
first
flavor
to
hit
is
a
huge
bomb
of
sweet
cinnamon
that
teases
of
being
too
much
but
ends
up
being
just
right
as
it
pairs
with
the
cocoa
roasted
malt
and
the
heat
of
the
peppers
in
the
finish
a
nice
creamy
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
i
havent
ventured
much
into
this
style
i
believe
this
is
my
third
chile
beer
though
it
is
also
the
best
one
ive
had
i
hope
my
experimental
chipotle
stout
comes
out
this
good
ok
i
had
this
beer
twice
the
first
time
i
tried
it
the
bartenter
whom
i
wont
name
said
it
tastes
like
licking
an
ash
tray
so
i
tried
it
and
lo
and
behold
it
tasted
like
an
awkward
beer
ive
never
had
an
ashtray
before
the
second
time
i
tried
it
was
to
try
and
confirm
the
previous
statement
i
thought
of
green
chilies
and
spices
and
even
tacos
it
worked
and
i
liked
it
this
is
a
creative
brew
that
ill
buy
again
off
tap
at
the
frisco
in
columbia
md
this
beer
was
a
dark
brown
color
like
stained
walnut
wood
the
one
finger
of
khakicolored
head
was
only
soso
but
it
did
leave
lacing
in
scattered
streaks
the
aroma
was
rather
faint
for
what
ended
up
being
a
highly
flavorful
brew
i
smelled
mostly
caramel
chocolate
and
candi
sugar
the
flavors
were
outstanding
i
tasted
chocolate
fruity
esters
toffee
belgian
candi
sugar
light
red
pepper
and
spicy
capsicum
notes
as
well
as
a
touch
of
bubblegum
well
balanced
and
not
overly
spicy
while
still
managing
to
hide
the
9
alc
very
well
the
mouthfeel
was
frothy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
delicate
delicious
and
complex
this
one
is
well
worth
ones
time
overall
solid
stuff
its
very
interesting
and
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
hitting
its
targets
is
it
successful
as
a
beer
theres
very
little
to
compare
it
to
im
personally
impressed
at
its
style
and
experimentation
but
i
cant
see
this
becoming
a
more
widely
accepted
genre
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
promised
mole
and
it
keeps
that
promise
i
would
definitely
have
more
given
the
chance
overall
its
interesting
definitely
a
specialty
beer
and
it
makes
you
crave
a
glass
of
water
every
few
sips
but
as
your
palate
gets
used
to
it
its
easier
to
drink
very
good
if
also
very
unique
in
my
experiences
very
well
done
while
i
like
different
types
of
beers
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
this
beer
really
isnt
for
me
this
is
just
plain
odd
the
fruit
punch
aspect
is
disturbing
the
cinnamon
is
overpowering
and
the
peppers
dont
add
much
flavor
just
heatburn
in
the
throat
on
the
swallow
maybe
this
is
a
bad
bottle
i
can
only
hope
it
is
it
was
odd
looking
smelling
and
tasting
drainpour
overall
a
very
tasty
experiment
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
look
for
it
again
d
really
interesting
this
is
unbalanced
and
weirdly
milk
chocolate
like
but
not
undrinkable
it
would
best
be
described
as
similar
to
mexican
hot
chocolate
overall
this
beer
is
very
interesting
and
complex
it
is
actually
really
nicely
balanced
and
unique
in
a
good
way
o
wow
really
impressed
with
this
one
new
belgium
has
made
a
chile
beer
right
the
whole
sweet
heat
flavor
profile
is
done
well
would
buy
this
again
o
this
brew
was
very
interesting
and
very
tasty
i
would
love
to
have
this
beer
again
and
again
o
interesting
and
different
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
dark
clear
amber
with
lovely
head
retention
complex
nose
with
nicely
balanced
cocoa
cinnamon
spice
and
dried
chili
sweet
and
smooth
and
full
bodied
but
drinkable
good
platform
for
the
interplay
between
chocolate
and
spice
love
the
chili
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
chili
beers
but
this
is
fantastic
i
think
they
used
dried
chili
which
gives
it
a
sort
of
sweet
grassy
almost
herbal
flavor
up
front
and
a
slightly
harsh
heat
in
the
back
not
too
hot
though
and
the
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
even
it
out
obscenely
drinkable
for
the
style
and
for
the
abv
drinkability
this
is
quite
drinkable
in
spite
of
the
chili
bite
the
chili
does
an
amazing
job
of
covering
the
9
abv
i
never
would
have
guessed
it
to
be
that
high
a
good
beer
not
for
everyone
and
those
with
an
aversion
to
spice
may
want
to
pass
but
its
relatively
drinkable
for
being
so
high
in
abv
and
so
spicy
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
reddishbrown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
that
didnt
stay
around
for
too
long
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
it
smells
like
chocolate
cinnamon
caramel
and
some
chile
peppers
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
chocolate
chile
peppers
cinnamon
caramel
and
a
little
bit
of
coffee
theres
a
good
lingering
spicy
finish
and
the
pepper
flavor
is
much
stronger
in
this
brew
than
i
expected
it
to
be
considering
the
aroma
isnt
very
spicy
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
and
coating
but
it
also
seems
somewhat
thin
at
times
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
think
its
a
good
tasty
brew
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
overall
this
beer
started
okay
but
ended
up
completely
falling
flat
for
me
the
spices
overwhelm
the
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
leaving
it
too
cinnamon
forward
in
the
end
which
says
a
lot
because
i
love
it
i
put
a
crapton
in
in
my
oatmeal
everyday
lof
series
beers
are
quite
hit
or
miss
you
can
guess
where
i
feel
this
one
falls
pair
it
with
something
mexican
mole
duh
burrito
peppered
flank
steak
churros
overall
this
was
pretty
darn
good
chile
beers
arent
usually
my
kind
of
thing
but
this
one
stands
out
above
most
to
me
would
recommend
to
any
chile
beer
fans
or
anyone
who
likes
mexican
hot
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
overall
this
is
pretty
good
i
dont
get
much
in
the
way
of
chili
though
damn
this
is
interesting
better
than
any
chili
pepper
beer
ive
ever
had
and
better
than
most
chocolate
beers
ive
known
an
interesting
drinking
experience
that
doesnt
overdo
it
in
any
way
just
keeps
everything
together
balanced
and
drinkable
mmm
chocolate
comes
back
keeping
pace
with
pepper
heat
yum
another
hit
from
the
lips
of
faith
interesting
offer
from
new
belgium
i
enjoyed
it
for
its
uniqueness
and
complexity
but
i
think
the
cinnamon
is
a
little
too
strong
and
that
makes
a
bomber
hard
to
finish
its
definitely
the
dominate
flavor
perhaps
best
suited
sharing
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
brownishred
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
and
cocoa
with
some
light
chili
notes
and
some
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
complex
there
is
a
ton
of
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
green
pepper
notes
as
well
as
some
cream
and
some
roasted
malt
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
heat
from
the
peppers
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
chocolatechili
beer
a
style
that
has
become
more
popular
and
i
am
always
excited
to
try
ostoked
well
rounded
very
drinkable
considering
how
high
the
abv
is
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
age
d
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
there
are
probably
a
bazillion
calories
in
here
but
it
tastes
great
and
the
alcohol
is
quite
wellhidden
i
imagine
itd
be
tough
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
by
myself
but
its
a
nice
beer
for
sharing
delivers
exactly
as
promised
would
drink
again
o
an
enjoyable
experience
chock
full
of
chocolate
and
peppery
spices
still
unremarkable
and
unrecommended
d
this
was
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
with
great
scent
and
taste
decent
body
and
smooth
finish
so
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
i
loved
the
kick
at
the
end
just
enough
to
be
serious
but
not
overpowering
probably
best
fresh
recommended
o
this
was
a
very
tasty
and
unique
beer
new
belgium
follows
through
on
exactly
what
they
advertised
an
ale
with
cocoa
and
spices
i
was
a
little
skeptical
from
the
appearance
as
this
basically
had
no
head
but
the
rest
of
beer
delivered
ill
definitely
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
lips
of
faith
beers
and
some
different
chile
beers
o
truly
enjoyed
this
one
another
interesting
offer
in
the
lips
of
faith
series
i
hope
to
see
this
one
again
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
lips
of
faith
series
in
my
experience
has
been
great
i
recommend
this
poured
a
nice
copper
into
my
pint
i
found
a
somewhat
metallic
nose
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
and
malt
hints
of
cocoa
and
vanilla
immediately
hit
my
mouth
with
a
sharp
bite
of
cinnamon
to
follow
after
a
few
brief
seconds
the
spice
from
the
peppers
hits
my
throat
i
was
very
surprised
at
how
awesome
this
beer
was
as
new
belgium
just
always
seems
to
be
so
mainstream
and
ordinary
this
beer
is
a
sipper
and
i
found
that
the
cocoa
and
vanilla
come
out
even
more
as
the
beer
warms
i
would
enjoy
this
again
especially
if
paired
with
chocolate
and
fruit
im
giving
it
a
4
5
overall
for
its
uniqueness
i
hope
they
make
it
a
year
or
two
from
now
preferably
at
christmas
overall
im
very
satisfied
with
this
beer
the
fact
that
its
so
unique
and
interesting
makes
it
easy
to
like
for
me
and
i
can
get
past
the
touch
of
heartburn
the
peppers
are
causing
me
the
drinkability
is
limited
since
the
flavors
are
so
unique
but
rich
but
a
perfect
beer
for
sharing
and
examining
its
different
attributes
certainly
not
a
beer
for
timid
palates
but
for
those
with
a
taste
for
the
extreme
and
different
this
is
a
perfect
example
definitely
a
conversation
starter
this
beer
is
completely
wicked
theres
a
light
pepper
spice
with
a
minimal
warming
sensation
along
with
light
chocolate
and
more
prenounced
cinnamon
notes
an
excellent
sipper
beer
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
the
smell
is
wonderful
too
i
really
hope
this
beer
comes
back
one
day
overall
just
a
celebration
beer
not
something
i
will
have
often
but
a
nice
sipper
o
i
was
very
satisfied
with
this
beer
and
could
easily
see
it
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
a
nice
spicy
tingly
finish
oh
its
9
abv
who
knew
o
theres
a
lot
of
promise
in
this
beer
if
it
would
have
done
what
i
anticipated
it
doing
namely
had
some
head
retention
and
developed
more
than
a
duopoly
of
flavors
it
could
have
been
very
good
as
it
is
average
to
below
average
brew
will
not
try
again
and
ill
try
to
restrain
myself
the
next
time
a
lof
beer
looks
interesting
650
ml
bottle
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
rocoa
smoked
chiles
vanilla
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
a
mineral
note
the
taste
is
sweet
cocoa
cinnamon
some
smoked
pepper
and
a
bit
of
a
mineral
note
it
finishes
with
some
smoky
pepper
heat
and
a
light
bitterness
light
body
low
carbonation
this
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
hunahpus
but
without
the
roastiness
to
balance
the
other
flavors
and
without
the
amazing
full
creamy
mouthfeel
notes
nice
and
pleasing
brew
it
does
not
deserve
the
praise
it
gets
in
some
quarters
but
it
is
well
worth
the
try
overall
disappointing
i
was
excited
an
curious
about
this
beer
but
it
fails
to
deliver
its
only
the
second
beer
from
the
lips
of
faith
series
that
ive
tried
but
theyve
both
been
below
average
the
other
one
was
biere
de
mars
surprising
as
i
really
like
new
belgiums
other
beers
anyway
this
beer
just
doesnt
taste
like
beer
it
seems
like
an
experiment
gone
wrong
the
spices
are
nice
but
given
the
strong
spices
youd
need
an
equally
robust
beer
to
support
them
i
had
this
on
a
recent
visit
to
todd
english
pub
in
las
vegas
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
it
i
found
the
atypical
to
beer
elements
to
be
too
overpowering
for
the
beer
itself
im
probably
not
the
best
person
so
listen
to
as
i
see
lots
of
good
reviews
but
i
could
barely
finish
mine
a
smooth
medium
body
likewise
for
the
carbonation
this
is
quite
tasty
and
would
have
been
even
better
to
sip
on
in
the
middle
of
winter
good
stuff
o
the
chile
beer
style
is
not
easy
to
get
right
but
i
think
new
belgium
has
done
a
good
job
with
this
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
lof
creations
i
have
had
yet
seek
it
out
4
this
was
shared
with
a
few
mates
at
a
tasting
party
we
all
came
to
the
same
conclusion
it
wasnt
worth
finishing
our
glasses
the
remainder
of
the
beer
was
poured
down
the
sink
i
rarely
dispose
of
mediocre
beer
but
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
finishing
this
one
very
disappointed
b
overall
digging
the
lightly
spiced
kick
finish
would
drink
again
my
experience
with
chile
beers
is
quite
minimal
and
i
did
not
know
new
belgium
was
producing
this
one
until
i
saw
it
at
a
local
pub
last
night
and
had
it
first
thing
the
beer
poured
nice
and
dark
and
had
a
nice
head
that
dissipated
soon
the
aroma
was
fantastic
lots
of
roasted
chocolate
and
spice
came
through
as
well
as
some
cinnamon
the
mouth
feel
was
good
a
little
thin
but
not
in
a
watery
way
more
of
a
pleasant
lightness
the
taste
was
absolutely
excellent
lots
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
comes
through
and
i
emphasize
the
roasted
as
well
as
lots
of
chili
the
flavor
sticks
around
and
some
more
hints
of
chilies
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
and
to
top
it
all
the
beer
improved
as
it
warmed
a
little
definitely
captures
the
mole
character
without
any
single
element
overpowering
any
other
an
excellent
surprise
for
a
tuesday
evening
overall
i
really
like
this
its
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
cinnamon
and
chili
spice
it
has
good
heat
but
is
not
the
standard
chili
beer
o
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
it
captures
mole
sauce
but
doesnt
overpower
or
overwhelm
making
it
quite
drinkable
and
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
helps
this
may
not
be
the
most
amazing
beer
by
any
stretch
but
its
quite
fun
and
enjoyable
that
i
must
say
o
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
i
enjoyed
it
with
some
smoked
salmon
and
was
perfect
together
thanks
daniel
this
beer
poured
a
medium
bodied
chestnut
brown
with
amber
highlights
and
a
one
finger
soapy
off
white
head
the
nose
features
slightly
sweet
dark
malts
toffee
light
chocolate
cinnamon
and
finishes
with
a
slight
pepper
spice
i
would
prefer
more
pepper
in
the
nose
but
its
decent
the
flavors
consist
of
a
lot
of
dark
malty
sweetness
cinnamon
nutmeg
light
cocoa
with
ever
so
slight
peppery
spice
its
a
little
sweet
and
because
of
the
spice
profile
with
chocolate
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
midnight
suns
chocolate
pumpkin
porter
yet
with
a
peppery
spice
its
ok
i
just
wish
there
was
more
pepper
like
a
lot
more
it
drinks
lighter
than
it
poured
and
lighter
than
it
looked
its
ok
i
expected
more
especially
with
high
reviews
i
love
spicy
foods
this
beer
is
lovable
for
that
reason
what
i
did
not
expect
however
was
the
baked
goodies
savory
flavor
a
guilty
dessert
without
the
multiple
spoons
of
sugar
probably
the
best
chile
beer
ive
had
to
date
4
0
much
lighter
than
expected
hardly
any
booze
detected
could
have
used
a
little
more
rich
chocolate
malt
to
balance
the
spice
although
the
cocoa
really
emerged
as
this
beer
warmed
very
nice
d
very
drinkable
very
unique
combination
of
flavors
but
everything
really
comes
together
nicely
i
really
like
the
head
level
on
this
one
overall
an
okay
beer
definitely
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
four
ounces
of
it
sweetness
fades
to
spices
which
fade
to
light
bitterness
which
becomes
chile
spice
very
complex
and
fairly
wellbalanced
trip
of
a
beer
never
had
anything
like
this
its
rather
approachable
and
the
residual
heat
makes
me
want
to
cool
my
mouth
down
with
another
sip
would
never
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
its
a
fun
spiced
beer
that
is
decently
well
put
together
overall
a
great
brew
and
in
par
with
the
lof
series
best
chile
beer
i
ever
had
overall
a
pleasant
experience
different
from
other
veggie
beers
ive
had
but
in
a
good
way
nicely
done
doa
a
unique
take
on
chilies
and
chocolate
ive
had
many
chocolate
chili
stouts
but
this
is
an
entirely
different
approach
its
a
well
done
chili
beer
thats
worth
a
try
i
think
ill
be
buying
another
soon
o
overall
i
think
it
is
a
fairly
interesting
brew
i
like
the
cocoa
nibs
but
the
chillies
seem
a
little
one
note
something
new
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
it
would
be
interesting
to
cook
with
overall
was
thinking
more
of
a
chocolate
stout
when
i
approached
this
but
this
is
very
much
a
chile
beer
hot
peppers
with
a
little
cocoa
powder
to
add
depth
but
no
sweetness
to
cut
the
burn
very
spice
driven
unusual
flavor
profile
thin
but
glad
to
have
a
little
diversity
i
will
probably
try
this
once
more
to
see
if
the
other
bottle
is
fresher
interesting
taste
and
aroma
but
weak
mouthfeel
and
appearance
put
me
off
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
chili
beers
are
a
great
change
of
pace
my
favorite
mexican
dish
is
chicken
mole
enchiladas
so
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
hotter
than
samual
adams
chili
bock
but
not
nearly
as
hot
as
sigdas
from
coopersmiths
new
belgium
concocted
a
recipe
that
incorporates
a
traditional
mexican
flavor
into
an
awesome
ale
well
done
o
this
is
like
no
other
beer
ive
had
before
the
sweet
and
spicy
work
really
well
together
but
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
spicy
beers
then
you
should
skip
this
one
im
really
enjoying
it
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
bottles
overall
an
interesting
beer
no
doubt
but
i
would
greatly
prefer
the
smoked
chile
flavors
to
be
handled
with
greater
subtlety
taste
is
more
chile
forward
providing
a
tingle
and
mild
heat
that
lingers
on
the
palate
into
the
aftertaste
balancing
the
front
end
chocolate
sweetness
medium
bodied
and
creamy
well
suited
to
the
spicy
chocolate
flavors
overall
a
pleasant
and
balanced
beer
that
was
easily
shared
the
chile
heat
is
a
little
tame
especially
in
recent
comparison
to
a
similar
local
chile
beer
end
of
days
from
pipeworks
very
interesting
beer
id
definitely
order
this
again
overall
i
might
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
but
this
beer
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
not
even
close
surprised
given
all
of
the
other
high
ratings
here
i
might
try
on
another
occasion
but
doubtful
o
glad
i
tried
this
one
unique
beer
at
a
great
price
o
fantastic
and
unique
take
on
the
chili
beer
balanced
between
sweetdry
with
obvious
spice
notes
that
are
bright
without
overpowering
the
beer
i
am
curious
if
the
squash
flavors
that
i
am
tasting
comes
from
one
of
the
peppers
or
if
it
is
just
the
combination
of
all
the
ingredients
check
this
one
out
fo
sho
darker
color
with
mocha
head
minimal
lacing
very
aromatic
beer
with
bitter
chocolate
and
some
spice
that
i
could
not
place
had
a
decent
alcohol
bite
but
the
chocolate
flavor
was
very
apparent
i
did
not
realize
it
was
a
chile
beer
until
i
started
this
reveiw
the
gals
i
was
with
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
did
i
like
the
chocolate
but
the
alcohols
at
the
back
end
were
a
little
excessive
might
have
been
the
chile
kick
cocoa
mole
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
tried
in
a
while
very
interesting
and
pretty
tasty
o
probably
the
best
chili
beer
i
have
had
to
date
the
level
of
heat
is
perfect
and
i
really
like
the
cinnamon
aspect
it
isnt
muddled
like
other
beers
that
use
it
despite
my
inclination
to
dislike
this
beer
i
kinda
like
it
this
is
a
salsa
beer
but
in
the
best
way
i
actually
like
heat
in
a
beer
its
not
overpowering
but
its
there
take
a
hint
ballast
point
be
more
subtle
not
something
id
like
more
than
a
couple
times
a
year
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying
now
if
we
can
get
new
belgium
to
make
horchata
d
well
done
this
really
is
one
of
the
best
chile
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
expression
of
chiles
melds
so
well
with
the
cocoa
parallels
the
light
cinnamon
notes
highly
recommend
this
outshined
chocolate
sombrero
clown
shoes
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
alcohol
is
well
hidden
o
i
couldnt
resist
trying
this
beer
when
i
saw
it
on
draft
because
i
love
spice
and
this
is
the
number
one
beer
of
the
style
on
this
site
the
flavors
and
aroma
are
powerful
but
never
out
of
hand
the
spices
really
come
out
as
it
warms
if
i
see
this
beer
again
i
will
definitely
get
it
very
different
from
other
beers
but
suits
my
tastes
well
and
the
high
abv
is
hidden
o
really
enjoyable
and
drinkable
surprisingly
the
alcohol
stays
underneath
and
the
adjuncts
are
really
flavorful
and
not
overwhelming
the
base
beer
seems
to
be
an
lighter
in
body
though
still
9
abv
and
that
makes
this
beer
unique
and
drinkable
a
superdark
creamy
beer
with
a
moderate
amount
of
dark
foam
the
aroma
had
bits
of
cocoa
and
toffee
mixing
in
with
a
small
amount
of
chille
the
taste
is
where
the
spice
comes
out
the
dark
malty
flavors
appear
first
them
the
chille
starts
to
come
out
and
gradually
build
as
you
drink
to
the
point
it
is
the
dominant
flavor
its
below
jalapino
for
heat
intensity
while
its
good
in
small
doses
it
was
somewhat
difficult
to
go
through
a
whole
bomber
along
with
the
cost
it
would
be
nice
to
have
these
available
in
regualr
of
half
bottles
pours
a
strange
dark
brown
but
see
through
like
soda
had
a
strange
carbonation
fizz
that
went
away
instantly
leaving
no
head
at
all
and
no
carbonation
bubbles
at
all
the
smell
is
of
cinnamon
and
all
spice
reminds
me
of
an
apple
pie
a
lot
no
cocoa
smell
at
all
after
a
minor
spillage
incident
we
will
get
to
the
tasting
very
harsh
on
the
tongue
and
by
that
i
mean
the
carbonation
bubbles
are
very
intense
and
unpleasant
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
cinnamon
and
other
spices
but
in
an
unflattering
way
this
might
be
my
least
favorite
of
the
lips
of
faith
series
and
may
not
be
finishable
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
unpleasant
i
apologize
for
giving
this
beer
such
a
bad
review
but
i
think
there
was
a
lot
to
be
desired
after
drinking
this
beer
a
very
nice
beer
definitely
brings
some
heat
from
the
peppers
but
doesnt
become
too
hot
and
maintains
a
nice
balance
with
the
cocoa
o
i
love
beer
and
i
love
hot
food
but
im
not
so
sure
about
combining
the
two
still
its
a
complex
interesting
experiment
thats
well
worth
a
shot
good
stuff
o
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
i
thought
it
worked
well
but
theres
no
way
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
o
an
amazing
beer
great
cold
straight
out
of
the
tap
or
warm
after
some
time
sitting
the
hype
is
real
on
this
one
easily
the
best
chile
beer
ive
had
although
it
seems
to
fall
into
another
style
new
belgium
really
knows
how
to
brew
these
lips
of
faith
beers
i
would
without
hesitation
order
this
again
ill
have
another
o
this
beer
truly
delivers
whats
advertised
a
mole
infused
beer
milder
chocolate
and
more
chile
heat
than
other
chocolate
chili
beers
that
seem
all
the
rage
lately
for
those
not
familiar
with
mole
this
one
may
be
a
little
brash
and
hot
for
those
who
enjoy
mole
like
myself
i
would
say
you
might
find
this
beer
a
treat
im
getting
this
again
o
its
kind
of
like
drinking
a
chocolate
covered
chili
pepper
with
some
cinnamon
on
the
top
im
not
too
into
chile
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
note
guajillo
and
ancho
chiles
used
no
cayenne
i
wasnt
entirely
off
i
enjoyed
this
one
of
the
better
chile
beers
ive
tried
one
of
the
better
lips
offerings
i
had
as
well
very
interesting
beer
im
a
fan
of
this
trend
with
chocolate
beers
that
arent
stouts
you
taste
the
actual
chocolate
more
as
opposed
to
roasted
malts
the
peppers
dont
seem
to
add
much
flavor
just
heat
which
isnt
so
exciting
still
good
though
overall
i
enjoyed
this
more
as
it
warmed
up
and
the
chiles
really
came
through
goes
perfectly
with
green
chile
burgers
if
anything
i
would
rebrew
this
one
with
even
more
chile
flavor
and
i
would
make
sure
that
bouquet
was
really
seeping
out
of
the
glass
the
cinnamon
and
cocoa
are
just
right
in
my
opinion
now
just
make
it
even
more
fun
with
a
bigger
impression
of
chilies
enjoy
o
overall
this
is
exceptional
for
the
style
the
abv
is
masterfully
hidden
and
one
cannot
dismiss
the
controlled
complexity
in
this
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
such
a
beer
i
really
like
the
sneakiness
of
the
heat
the
flavor
is
robust
but
not
overwhelming
dig
it
as
the
beer
warmed
the
cocoa
notes
became
a
bit
more
evident
as
did
the
heat
from
the
chiles
used
i
picked
up
on
more
of
the
maltiness
and
less
of
the
subtlies
like
the
smoke
flavors
pours
a
clear
but
ugly
dark
amber
color
topped
with
a
somewhat
frothy
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
chalky
chocolate
and
cinnamon
dominate
the
nose
first
sip
is
just
what
the
aroma
predicted
except
with
a
tad
less
chocolate
there
is
a
splash
of
some
dark
fruits
present
too
but
let
there
be
no
mistake
the
cinnamon
and
spice
dominate
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
as
carbonation
is
spot
on
though
the
body
falls
easily
on
the
thin
side
the
9
abv
is
super
well
hidden
not
badnot
great
either
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
deep
garnet
brown
amber
one
finger
light
brown
head
that
slowly
dissipates
into
a
film
and
ring
around
the
glas
slight
lacing
aroma
of
mexican
chocolate
spicy
and
aromatic
and
very
faint
malt
flavor
is
excellent
a
blend
of
chocolate
cinnamon
and
dark
malt
with
the
chili
hotness
slowly
building
up
to
a
hot
spicy
roasty
sweet
malt
and
chocolate
finish
wow
medium
bodied
with
constant
carbonation
the
flavor
progression
and
balance
of
flavor
element
is
very
well
done
the
mexican
chocolate
flavor
is
spoton
this
is
the
best
chili
beer
ive
tasted
despite
the
heavy
flavor
constituents
and
high
abv
this
is
a
pretty
light
easy
drinking
brew
it
actually
leaves
me
wishing
it
drank
a
bit
more
like
thick
mexican
hot
chocolate
but
its
still
delicious
and
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
beer
they
really
managed
to
bring
all
the
flavors
together
in
it
i
dont
typically
think
peppers
work
that
well
in
beer
but
in
this
one
they
did
a
lot
of
bold
flavors
and
ingredients
in
it
but
they
came
together
very
well
i
really
liked
the
uniqueness
to
it
as
well
very
well
done
beer
overall
this
is
awesome
and
would
pair
well
with
pork
barbecue
etc
i
may
have
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
pours
a
cherry
hued
brown
with
little
foam
formation
and
no
lace
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
insane
probably
in
my
top
five
noses
cinnamon
cocoa
chili
sugar
coffee
just
the
slightest
grain
malt
these
come
together
and
honestly
remind
me
of
cinnamon
toast
crunch
cereal
fucking
awesome
great
cinnamon
and
cereal
flavor
with
a
good
sharp
burn
at
the
rear
of
the
palate
really
dig
this
beer
im
worried
about
its
aging
potential
so
im
drinking
the
shit
out
of
it
while
i
can
medium
bodied
with
prickly
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
really
hope
this
becomes
an
annual
release
they
really
hit
it
out
of
the
park
here
o
quite
interesting
mosdef
a
winner
awesome
use
of
ingredients
and
the
execution
matchedexceeded
the
planning
fantastic
depth
of
flavor
definitely
a
buy
while
it
is
still
on
shelves
d
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
however
this
one
isnt
for
me
chilies
and
chocolate
make
for
a
lot
of
flavor
that
is
a
too
much
for
me
glad
i
tried
but
on
to
the
next
lof
for
this
guy
o
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
think
this
would
have
been
much
better
as
a
chocolate
and
spice
beer
with
a
bit
of
chile
pepper
rather
than
a
beer
that
ends
up
focusing
far
too
heavily
on
the
chile
o
this
is
a
very
good
chilie
beer
i
really
like
the
roastiness
to
balance
the
chilies
o
the
creativity
works
for
this
one
this
is
what
i
had
expected
from
dogfish
heads
theobroma
where
dogfish
head
approximated
a
recipe
analyzed
from
clay
pots
new
belgium
instead
delivered
what
may
have
been
the
common
ideal
of
a
beer
brewed
with
cocoa
chillies
and
other
assorted
spices
nicely
done
certainly
worth
revisiting
o
the
best
beer
from
the
lips
of
faith
collection
ive
had
maybe
some
added
spiciness
would
improve
it
a
little
and
cut
down
on
the
sweetness
a
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
highlights
minimal
head
quickly
fades
leaving
sparse
lacing
s
strong
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
chiles
with
some
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
t
flavors
of
cinnamon
and
other
spices
nice
chile
flavor
throughout
which
lingers
minimal
hops
presence
m
a
little
thin
with
a
generous
carbonation
a
nice
smelling
and
tasting
beer
perhaps
more
body
and
less
carbonation
definitely
recommend
well
done
nb
and
1st
beer
back
since
the
crash
the
pour
is
almost
mahogany
in
color
with
a
khaki
colored
head
a
really
enjoyable
spice
aroma
lots
of
cinnamon
and
peppers
though
to
a
lesser
degree
the
chocolate
is
pronounced
and
gives
a
nice
sweetness
some
serious
raisin
and
plum
character
too
pleasantly
sweet
in
terms
of
the
flavor
lots
of
chocolate
and
fruit
notes
with
a
sweet
bready
quality
good
spice
and
pepper
flavor
with
a
subtle
earthiness
really
well
done
all
around
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
lips
of
faith
series
complex
spicy
drinkable
and
most
of
all
extremely
tasty
fantastic
beer
it
basically
does
everything
right
id
put
this
one
up
there
with
erics
ale
and
le
terroir
as
a
healthy
and
fun
surprise
from
new
belgium
in
their
lips
of
faith
series
of
releases
ill
be
picking
up
more
before
theyre
gone
m
d
this
is
a
delicious
beer
with
a
very
finetuned
balance
that
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
body
has
a
smooth
creaminess
that
complements
the
flavours
quite
nicely
and
the
spicy
finish
rounds
that
out
very
well
this
is
certainly
a
beer
i
will
be
returning
to
a
really
wonderful
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
chile
beers
since
so
many
of
them
are
unbalanced
with
heat
and
not
much
else
this
one
is
dubbed
as
a
mole
and
i
have
to
say
it
truly
does
taste
like
a
mole
you
get
a
nicely
balanced
melange
of
flavors
with
some
nice
ancho
chile
cinnamon
chocolate
vanilla
and
some
black
pepper
along
with
some
moderate
malty
sweetness
the
nose
is
more
cinnamon
and
chile
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
spice
level
is
just
right
to
start
with
its
a
warming
roasty
heat
rather
than
a
sharp
biting
spice
using
the
right
kind
of
chiles
helps
here
there
are
ancho
guajillo
and
chipotle
so
you
get
a
warm
fruity
smokiness
with
moderate
heat
not
the
sort
of
bright
fruity
heat
of
habaneros
or
the
sharp
herbalness
and
spice
if
jalapenos
or
birds
eyes
the
rounded
fruitiness
and
roasty
notes
here
blend
very
well
with
the
other
flavors
and
presents
a
lovely
integrated
whole
with
the
heat
slowly
building
to
a
pleasant
tingling
and
the
spice
and
vanilla
notes
echoing
in
the
background
after
the
base
has
been
built
by
the
chocolate
and
malt
the
best
lips
of
faith
offering
ive
had
in
a
while
very
nice
indeed
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
nice
carbonation
is
right
there
at
a
moderate
level
and
the
body
is
right
on
the
boarder
of
mediumfull
leaning
more
towards
medium
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
within
the
mixture
of
chocolate
and
chile
drinkability
would
seem
high
because
the
alcohol
isnt
present
but
the
flavor
is
so
potent
that
i
cant
imagine
anyone
wanting
to
slam
these
down
excellent
beer
o
this
was
one
of
the
most
memorable
beers
ive
tasted
in
the
last
year
or
so
no
flaws
and
not
a
trace
of
booze
detected
i
will
try
this
beer
again
in
the
future
many
more
times
strong
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
cinnamon
plus
fruity
and
cocoa
notes
and
hints
of
malt
and
cloves
it
pours
a
dark
warm
slightly
hazy
brown
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
flavor
has
a
malty
core
and
cinnamon
earthy
chocolate
and
whoa
hot
spice
notes
smooth
texture
is
a
little
creamy
and
fairly
fizzy
with
needlelike
stabs
from
the
hot
pepper
and
a
powdery
hint
a
distinctive
and
unique
brew
that
is
most
worthy
if
you
like
variety
in
your
beers
o
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
find
easy
to
drink
but
i
could
see
how
the
pepper
heat
could
be
a
turnoff
for
some
i
would
compare
this
to
something
like
a
chocolate
covered
jalapeno
but
not
as
hot
this
has
a
great
kick
from
the
peppers
but
the
taste
is
not
driven
by
the
peppers
definitely
will
stock
up
on
this
o
new
belgium
has
created
one
of
the
most
unique
and
memorable
beers
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
cocoa
molé
captures
the
essence
of
chili
beer
almost
perfectly
there
isnt
much
if
anything
at
all
id
change
about
this
beer
from
its
adorable
sugar
skulls
through
the
completely
hidden
alcohol
punch
and
sneaky
spice
heat
to
the
smooth
supple
chocolaty
body
cocoa
molé
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
capable
of
incapacitating
the
burliest
of
men
this
beer
may
very
well
ruin
whatever
meal
youre
eating
it
with
but
its
an
odd
delicacy
on
its
own
sweet
spicy
and
smooth
enough
that
youll
forget
its
9
abv
quite
enjoyable
esp
as
a
after
dinner
valentines
treat
wouldnt
drink
it
every
day
unique
better
than
other
spiced
beers
that
ive
had
overall
cocoa
mole
is
fairly
good
for
a
chile
beer
which
can
if
particularly
onenoteish
or
even
vaguely
reminiscent
of
the
nightmareinducing
cave
creek
chili
beer
have
a
very
limited
appeal
for
me
so
again
good
job
nb
wondering
what
to
drink
for
day
of
the
dead
22
oz
bottle
from
olive
tree
in
ocean
beach
a
brilliant
chile
beer
that
really
enhances
the
chile
through
the
malt
and
spices
feels
like
a
winter
warmer
and
a
lighter
take
on
a
belgian
quad
well
crafted
im
came
away
very
satisfied
with
my
purchase
o
very
good
stuff
not
too
hot
i
liked
this
a
lot
something
different
and
tasty
need
to
get
some
more
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
chile
beers
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
well
i
thought
the
cinnamon
did
over
power
the
chili
just
a
touch
t
a
bit
sweet
and
smooth
upfront
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
then
the
peppers
hit
but
the
taste
never
gets
overwhelmingly
hot
leaves
a
lingering
warmth
on
the
tongue
and
a
bit
of
a
dryness
on
the
finish
biggest
complaint
is
the
thin
mouthfeel
a
great
experiment
and
a
pretty
awesome
result
i
was
actually
a
little
bit
disappointed
with
this
beer
from
all
the
hype
that
i
herd
surrounding
it
brown
and
not
as
dark
as
i
would
have
liked
or
expected
with
a
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
smell
gives
off
a
lot
of
spice
and
some
cocoa
mainly
chile
peppers
actually
quite
pungent
the
taste
starts
off
full
and
a
bit
of
a
chocolaty
malt
but
quickly
is
overshadowed
by
the
spices
the
spices
are
too
overpowering
and
the
balance
between
spices
and
chocolate
are
not
very
complementing
finished
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
usually
like
spicy
food
but
this
beer
was
not
for
me
i
guess
i
am
more
of
a
hop
head
in
the
making
but
i
think
that
this
beer
is
certainly
different
and
worth
trying
others
who
i
shared
it
with
really
liked
it
beer
is
light
in
body
dry
on
the
finish
all
of
the
chili
flavor
comes
in
the
finish
it
is
mildly
hot
the
forward
of
the
beer
almost
tastes
like
chai
with
a
little
clove
and
a
lot
of
cinnamon
flavors
it
was
fine
but
i
wont
have
it
again
pours
a
dark
brownishpurple
with
hints
of
ruby
red
mediumsmall
offwhite
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
immediately
packed
with
chile
and
bellpepper
sweet
chocolate
and
dark
malts
as
well
taste
is
very
interesting
a
lot
of
different
spices
cinnamon
cumin
black
pepper
and
crushed
red
pepper
very
nice
chile
flavor
with
a
good
amount
of
spicy
heat
as
the
beer
warms
and
the
more
sips
i
take
the
more
heat
i
get
finishes
with
sweet
cinnamon
and
cocoa
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
spicy
drinkability
is
fairly
high
if
you
can
handle
the
heat
overall
this
is
a
very
good
chile
beer
overall
this
is
pretty
damn
delicious
and
the
pepper
integration
is
lovely
great
non
pepper
spices
are
used
to
evenly
match
the
spicy
pepper
attributes
nice
found
this
a
bit
overwhelming
a
snifter
pour
is
a
good
serving
size
anything
else
is
masochism
outside
of
the
pepper
heat
the
body
is
light
and
it
feels
like
a
brown
ale
plus
peppers

dark
brown
color
with
a
minimal
head
looks
red
up
against
the
light
smells
pretty
good
like
cinnamon
mostly
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
tastes
like
cocoa
cinnamon
and
has
the
slightest
bit
of
heat
from
the
peppers
spicy
the
alcohol
was
pretty
well
hidden
but
maybe
that
is
the
peppers
masking
it
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
overall
sensational
and
different
pours
a
brown
ale
color
with
some
good
bubbling
smells
outrageous
tons
of
cocoa
powder
in
the
nose
bits
of
cinnamon
and
some
smoked
pepper
vibe
pablano
maybe
flavor
is
so
balanced
cocoa
powder
up
front
not
sweet
at
all
then
comes
a
little
heat
but
not
in
your
face
ancho
the
bottle
says
would
account
for
that
smokey
thing
good
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
sweetness
and
richness
pleasant
mouthfeel
works
with
this
beer
medium
bodied
to
fuller
bodied
and
a
mildly
spicy
booze
laced
finish
especially
as
it
warms
up
here
the
cocoa
is
what
is
memorable
for
me
here
i
like
this
one
a
whole
lot
way
above
my
expectations
overall
interesting
beer
i
would
love
to
grab
another
few
of
these
for
cinco
de
mayo
the
lips
of
faith
series
rarely
disappoints
and
this
is
another
wonderful
addition
to
their
canon
o
a
good
beer
overall
that
definitely
reminds
me
of
a
mole
sauce
it
has
a
good
amount
of
heat
though
i
could
wish
for
more
cocoa
presence
still
its
unique
and
tasty
o
for
what
it
is
this
is
an
extremely
well
executed
beer
it
captures
the
mexican
culture
not
only
in
the
cool
label
art
but
also
in
the
balance
of
flavors
i
am
a
big
fan
of
mole
and
have
tried
other
mole
inspired
beers
and
have
been
disappointed
see
new
holland
mole
ocho
this
one
has
great
balance
and
really
works
with
that
sweet
and
spicy
combo
well
done
new
belgium
overall
it
was
a
very
well
made
chile
beer
the
spice
was
there
but
didnt
steal
the
show
and
didnt
make
it
unenjoyable
this
is
definitely
a
unique
beer
and
whereas
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
having
another
some
time
in
the
future
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
ever
again
this
is
for
sharing
and
sipping
as
the
lingering
spice
can
be
quite
unappealing
at
times
different
but
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
this
is
the
most
interesting
of
the
lips
of
faith
beers
i
have
had
poured
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
thin
tannish
colored
head
atop
smells
of
chocolatevanilla
beanand
cinnamonto
me
like
mexican
hot
chocolatereally
cool
a
bunch
of
stuff
going
on
on
the
palate
with
chocolate
being
predominant
as
well
vanillacinnamon
and
chili
comes
into
play
at
the
back
end
providing
a
slow
burn
a
little
light
in
the
mouth
but
thats
the
only
small
drawback
to
the
beerits
the
most
interesting
take
on
a
chile
beer
i
have
had
imo
this
beer
tastes
exactly
how
it
smells
its
a
beautiful
change
to
my
everyday
choices
i
highly
recommend
cocoa
mole
for
anyone
that
is
up
for
something
different
i
kinda
dont
want
to
finish
this
beer
i
just
want
to
keep
smelling
the
beautiful
aroma
overall
i
though
this
was
a
very
good
chili
beer
but
not
as
good
as
some
other
chocolate
chili
beers
ive
had
such
as
the
reunion
and
vixen
additionally
just
for
the
sake
of
information
i
followed
this
up
with
a
terrapin
2010
gamma
ray
also
on
tap
at
the
busy
bee
and
it
was
probably
the
bestmost
unique
12
punch
ive
had
in
some
time
if
not
ever
o
a
wonderfully
unique
beer
that
certainly
evokes
its
namesake
id
love
to
see
this
become
a
yearly
release
its
that
good
a
unique
interesting
awesome
chile
beer
id
recommend
drinking
this
one
fresh
as
the
chiles
are
vibrant
and
flavorful
though
not
overpowering
or
truly
spicy
in
a
classic
sense
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
random
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
cinnamon
and
other
spices
and
mexican
hot
chocolate
absolutely
fantastic
smelling
taste
is
of
cinnamon
and
other
spices
cocoa
powder
and
some
slight
chile
flavors
there
is
a
slight
warming
in
the
back
of
the
throat
from
the
chili
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
taste
wise
but
exceptional
in
the
smell

o
i
bought
one
to
lay
down
for
a
while
and
see
what
happens
for
me
to
enjoy
this
beer
more
the
sweetness
and
cinnamon
character
need
to
tone
down
a
bit
im
hoping
some
age
will
accomplish
this
i
would
say
this
is
a
sweeter
less
refined
and
sloppier
vertical
epic
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
and
i
didnt
love
it
it
just
kind
of
lands
in
the
middle
somewhere
for
me
for
9
a
bomber
its
not
terribly
expensive
and
i
am
curious
to
see
what
6
months
to
a
year
will
do
for
the
one
in
my
cellar
an
interesting
brew
this
is
an
intricate
complex
beer
the
flavors
are
unique
and
enjoyable
the
abv
is
big
but
its
still
drinkable
if
you
enjoy
cocoa
and
spices
youll
love
this
definitely
worth
a
try
d
good
drinkability
if
your
a
fan
of
peppers
if
not
it
might
not
be
for
you
this
would
be
one
hell
of
a
food
beer
easily
my
favorite
chili
beer
so
far
most
that
ive
tasted
had
serious
issues
balancing
the
elements
too
much
spice
not
enough
bitterness
other
adjuncts
that
clash
with
the
chili
flavor
etc
this
one
seems
to
hit
all
the
marks
though
with
its
complexity
and
harmony
dark
ruby
color
with
a
fine
filmy
head
and
a
slim
creamy
ring
around
the
edges
spotty
lace
warm
cinnamon
is
prominent
in
the
aromavery
much
like
apple
crisp
with
increasing
chocolate
as
it
warms
and
only
a
faint
hint
of
chilies
cocoa
caramel
and
spice
are
brought
together
in
a
smooth
blend
of
flavors
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
vanilla
and
peppers
providing
some
heat
in
the
finish
pretty
damn
tasty
medium
bodied
and
warming
with
fine
carbonation
very
nice
flavor
is
a
bit
onedimensional
up
front
with
brown
sweet
malts
leading
the
way
alongside
a
hint
of
cinnamon
however
the
finish
more
than
makes
up
for
it
as
a
lingering
pepper
heat
sinks
in
and
delivers
a
capsaicin
pop
that
simmers
on
the
back
of
the
palate
long
after
each
sip
the
heat
isnt
overpowering
though
as
it
balances
out
nicely
the
initial
sweetspicy
flavors
alcohol
presence
becomes
more
notable
as
cocoa
mole
warms
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
not
too
heavy
making
this
beer
quite
drinkable
considering
all
thats
going
on
inside
it
another
solid
lips
of
faith
release
from
new
belgiumthis
one
is
worth
seeking
out
overall
very
unique
taste
yummy
overall
a
good
beer
glad
i
bought
it
id
recommend
it
poured
from
updated
bomber
to
nbb
globe
glass
the
beer
pours
a
thick
amber
brown
with
orange
amber
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
a
thick
1
5
finger
cream
color
head
with
decent
retention
some
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
very
unique
cinnamon
mixed
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
some
pepper
smells
like
my
grandmothers
cinnamon
sugar
cookies
actually
with
some
cocoa
sprinkled
in
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
with
an
initial
rush
of
sharp
cinnamon
immediately
followed
by
the
cocoa
and
caramel
flavors
mild
bitterness
the
peppers
are
most
noticeable
on
the
finish
as
you
feel
a
little
heat
and
a
slight
burn
suddenly
the
heat
fades
and
the
cinnamon
again
mixes
in
quite
complex
and
yet
fairly
smooth
full
bodied
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
think
most
of
the
heat
character
is
from
the
peppers
overall
very
happy
to
have
tried
it
not
a
beer
youd
want
to
pound
all
day
but
i
enjoyed
it
would
purchase
again
its
nice
that
the
chili
isnt
overwhelming
as
is
often
the
case
with
so
many
brews
made
with
chili
it
settles
in
nicely
with
the
cocoa
cinnamon
and
caramel
malts
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
chile
beer
one
that
id
seek
out
to
try
again
for
sure

taste
is
lemony
and
yeasty
at

with

but
when
the

are
in
there
and
take
all
over
the

light

good

mouthfeel
too
hot
for
my
liking
in
fact
i
strongly
prefer
the
regular
version
of
the
four
holy
sour
chili
beer
the
perplexity
of
this
beer
starts
with
aroma
and
ends
about
5
minutes
after
you
finish
your
last
drink
the
appearance
is
a
golden
hue
with
minimum
white
head
the
head
settles
out
to
a
weird
flocculation
partially
due
to
the
bret
n
chili
the
aroma
is
mostly
brett
and
strong
super
citrus
the
taste
is
a
whole
new
ballgame
its
initially
like
a
traditional
wheatsaison
hybrid
sessionable
coriander
peach
then
it
its
touches
on
the
side
palette
with
bret
and
spunk
it
hits
the
back
of
the
throat
with
huge
chili
flavor
the
worst
the
worst
part
about
this
beer
is
when
it
gets
room
temp
its
better
with
more
enticing
flavor
this
is
one
i
look
forward
to
having
this
around
during
the
summer
time
to
grill
with
i
was
definitely
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
it
poured
very
crisp
clean
and
clear
and
the
aroma
eminating
out
of
the
tulip
glass
was
a
blast
of
citrus
goodness
that
made
my
mouth
start
watering
the
taste
was
right
in
line
with
the
citrus
but
slowly
evolved
with
heat
and
the
mouthfeel
was
so
effervescent
and
finished
clean
with
the
lingering
slight
burn
of
the
peppers
loved
it
finished
it
before
i
knew
it
want
another
one
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ever
a
low
alcohol
sour
beer
blonde
in
color
with
a
splotchy
white
head
with
african
chili
peppers
as
hot
as
habanero
the
nose
on
this
is
just
amazing
bright
citrus
notes
after
the
intense
tartness
and
lactic
sourness
back
off
mouth
watering
fruits
pears
and
peaches
and
very
little
clue
of
the
peppers
at
all
the
flavor
starts
like
a
neat
blonde
sour
maybe
sour
mashed
acidic
but
not
caustic
soft
in
feel
and
very
light
on
the
grain
front
next
comes
a
strong
wave
of
citrus
fruit
followed
immediately
by
an
slowly
escalating
heat
that
warms
the
throat
and
tongue
after
the
swallow
but
never
gets
too
hot
its
a
brilliant
showcase
of
this
peppers
flavors
without
detracting
from
the
beer
with
a
stomach
wrenching
heat
finish
is
long
and
warm
without
being
too
much
at
all
i
can
hold
the
beer
in
my
mouth
and
taste
it
for
30
seconds
if
i
want
to
but
the
peppery
heat
doesnt
come
on
until
i
swallow
it
very
light
body
on
this
and
plenty
of
sour
my
first
chili
sour
beer
i
think
and
its
a
major
success
some
of
the
best
upright
beer
ive
had
for
sure
and
something
that
demands
food
pairings
of
the
most
interesting
sort
so
cool
this
was
my
first
beer
from
upright
brewing
portland
or
i
drank
this
beer
during
super
bowl
xlviii
as
the
broncos
championship
hopes
were
being
crushed
however
this
fatali
four
was
a
bright
spot
in
an
otherwise
forgettable
super
bowl
experience
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
the
smell
had
notes
of
lemon
wheat
and
brett
funk
the
taste
was
quite
exceptional
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
a
fresh
squeezed
summer
honey
lemonade
with
big
floral
notes
brett
funk
and
cayenne
peppers
on
the
finish
i
say
summer
honey
because
this
beer
had
huge
floral
notes
throughout
which
are
associated
with
honey
harvested
in
the
summertime
i
was
amazed
by
the
complex
balance
of
the
lemon
tartness
the
floral
honey
sweetness
and
the
spicy
kick
of
cayennelike
pepper
on
the
finish
i
thought
the
flavors
really
played
beautifully
with
each
other
this
may
have
been
my
favorite
chile
beer
of
alltime
as
i
really
liked
how
the
fatali
peppers
played
a
complimentary
role
to
add
another
element
of
flavor
dimension
rather
than
having
the
entire
beer
be
dominated
by
chile
heat
i
was
really
impressed
with
upright
and
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers

the

is
a
mild
amount
of

heat
on

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
chile
presence
that
works
well
with

base
beer
9

this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
light
and
easy
drinking
with
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
arrangement
of
flavoring
you
get
the
expected
character
of
a
saison
that
is
somewhat
wild
with
lemony
lacto
notes
and
then
the
pepper
inclusion
is
a
total
twist
with
the
perfect
amount
of
heat
upright
really
does
it
for
me
yet
again
color
me
impressed
overall
another
interesting
tasty
saison
from
upright
along
with
logsdon
they
pretty
much
have
the
domestic
saison
market
cornered
o
this
beer
is
decent
i
think
this
bottle
is
a
bit
flat
to
be
honest
there
just
isnt
much
carbonation
to
make
the
flavors
of
the
saison
really
pop
the
heat
on
the
back
end
it
really
enjoyable
and
a
bit
unexpected
even
though
i
knew
it
was
brewed
with
peppers
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
someday
im
a
real
sucker
for
pepper
beers
fatali
four
pours
a
light
bodied
mildly
cloudy
and
bright
yellow
gold
in
color
with
a
two
finger
bright
white
head
its
surprising
how
light
in
color
it
is
the
nose
is
bright
and
citrusy
with
a
good
amount
of
lemon
with
a
touch
of
citrusy
sweet
followed
by
a
moderate
amount
of
pepper
for
a
pepper
beer
the
nose
is
overly
complex
the
flavors
are
all
saison
up
front
its
light
and
really
citrusy
with
a
good
amount
of
lemon
and
a
night
almost
berliner
weiss
esque
tartness
the
beer
then
goes
into
the
pepper
leaving
your
mouth
with
a
light
tingle
from
the
heat
for
the
next
five
minutes
it
then
leaves
your
mouth
watering
god
i
love
this
it
drinks
light
and
crisp
and
the
tartness
is
perfect
this
is
by
far
the
best
pepper
beer
ive
had
and
ive
searched
them
out
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
its
some
of
uprights
finest
work
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
in
color
with
pale
yellow
highlights
and
a
very
thin
bubbly
head
that
left
very
minimal
wisps
of
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
citrusy
and
tart
character
were
noticeable
on
the
first
whiff
with
a
little
malty
sweetness
some
yeasty
notes
and
slight
chile
notes
coming
through
very
nice
tart
spicey
flavors
upfront
on
the
palate
but
the
chile
spice
is
well
balanced
and
not
over
done
i
did
get
a
little
grain
mild
bretty
funk
and
citrusy
accents
the
brew
was
medium
to
light
in
body
with
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
mild
funky
citrusy
slightly
spicey
tart
and
subtle
dry
finish
very
well
done
beer
and
enjoyed
it
for
sure
well
this
was
quite
exceptional
a
light
cloudy
straworange
body
with
a
healthy
white
froth
very
light
and
refreshing
tartness
perfectly
in
balance
with
a
kick
of
heat
from
the
chiles
funky
and
yeasty
lots
of
lemon
and
earthy
must
dry
finish
lined
this
up
with
a
spicy
dish
for
dinner
will
be
going
out
to
find
more
of
this
asap
o
whey
did
i
wait
so
long
on
this
one
unique
and
great
medium
bodied
but
fuller
than
expected
with
a
really
nice
balance
of
zesty
spice
hot
peppers
farmhouse
yeast
and
light
fruit
apple
pear
and
banana
with
hay
straw
and
a
nice
pepper
presence
thats
not
overly
hot
really
well
balanced
with
the
peppers
nicely
integrated
surprisingly
drinkable
considering
the
heat
a
lot
of
pepperchili
beers
are
gimicky
and
insanely
hot
but
this
beer
was
complex
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
the
pepper
note
really
adds
some
interesting
depth
without
overwhelming
the
base
beer

taste
mirrors
the

brett
inspired
funk
more
sour
than
tart
though
i
was
surprised
how
little
chile
was
present
got
minimal
warming
certainly
paled
in
heat
and
chile
aroma
comparison
with
the
hot
blonde
mouthfeel
medium
decent
effervescence
pretty
dry
finish
the
pdx
homies
told
me
this
was
more
sour
than
previous
batches
and
im
alright
with
that
though
wish
more
chile
heat
had
shown
through
d
an
interesting
twist
on
the
style
with
the
hefty
spicy
chiles
you
cannot
see
much
from
the
barrel
aging
aspect
but
the
chiles
sure
throw
their
weight
around
i
will
be
the
first
to
say
i
really
do
not
care
for
really
spicy
chiletype
of
beers
but
this
one
is
more
up
my
alley
than
most
i
have
had
pour
is
light
yellowish
orange
with
a
tight
white
head
the
nose
is
very
interesting
and
has
a
nice
light
spice
to
it
minty
and
sweet
bright
apricot
with
a
sweet
doughy
aspect
and
light
vanilla
the
taste
is
similar
spicey
interestingly
sweet
and
doughy
the
peppery
spice
is
more
assertive
with
the
fruit
favors
still
bright
a
touch
acetic
and
rather
sour
the
body
is
well
carbonated
light
and
airy
beer
is
light
in
body
late
spiciness
decent
not
overpowering
there
is
this
mild
floral
sense
and
this
nice
vegetalness
that
finishes
a
little
dry
id
have
this
again
o
upright
really
uses
the
peppers
in
a
good
way
with
this
beer
with
so
many
spiced
beer
disasters
its
nice
to
see
this
one
turn
out
for
the
good
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
really
unique
and
quite
good
i
never
thought
to
add
chiles
to
a
beer
as
light
as
this
belgianstyle
thing
but
it
works
a
nice
blend
of
crisp
fruit
funk
and
heat
i
dig
it
beer
pours
a
clear
goldenorange
with
a
thin
white
head
interestingly
its
noticeably
darker
than
the
regular
four
the
aroma
doesnt
really
prepare
you
for
whats
to
come
it
smells
more
like
a
typical
upright
saison
with
a
hint
of
spicepepper
in
there
the
flavor
however
is
a
whole
different
story
i
typically
think
of
chile
beers
as
a
bit
of
a
gimmick
but
this
beer
is
the
first
of
its
kind
ive
had
that
really
did
a
fantastic
job
of
incorporating
the
peppers
into
the
flavor
of
the
beer
without
having
it
overwhelm
it
the
light
slightly
spicy
more
typicalsaison
fours
flavors
just
meld
perfectly
with
the
spicy
peppers
and
you
get
a
nice
mildly
spicy
kick
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
was
shocked
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
kudos
to
upright
for
trying
something
bold
and
succeeding
so
thoroughly
body
is
light
and
effervescent
good
heat
through
the
finish
another
excellent
saison
offering
from
upright
why
am
i
not
surprised
o
as
my
chest
warms
and
my
lips
begin
to
burn
i
am
finishing
my
beer
not
something
i
could
have
all
the
time
or
lots
of
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
nice
work
upright
o
complex
mixed
assembledge
and
very
enjoyable
would
like
more
o
very
good
beer
similar
in
a
lot
of
ways
to
the
anniversary
beer
they
did
for
belmont
station
last
year
due
to
the
similar
malt
base
and
barrel
usage
if
you
liked
the
14th
anniversary
then
youll
like
this
one
just
expect
a
slight
heat
on
the
finish

one
of
the
better
pepper
beers
ive
had

minimal

is
deceptively
tame
citrus
mild

with
a
touch
of

pleasing
but
suggests
a
tame
saison
with
a
mild
kick
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
initially
citrus
and
juicy
flavors
dominate
before
some
light
saison
funk
finish
gets
hot
and
the
long
aftertaste
becomes
pleasant
warm
singing
the
roof
of
the
mouth
and
corners
of
my
chest
cavity
slightly
under
carbonated
and
watery
in
the
finish
reminds
me
of
my
favorite
saison
vautour
with
a
respectable
pepper
addition
very
impressed
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
not
particularly
saisony
a
very
interesting
beer
how
a
pepper
beer
should
be
good
burn
but
not
so
overpowering
it
takes
away
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
o
d
the
spice
is
too
much
for
me
im
pretty
sensitive
to
it
and
at
first
its
pretty
tame
but
after
a
while
it
is
too
much
both
pour
a
clear
golden
orange
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
regular
four
has
a
crazy
amount
of
head
fatali
four
is
fairly
minimal
headed
both
smell
a
bit
funky
the
fatali
has
a
nice
kick
of
pepper
on
the
nose
both
have
a
wheaty
saison
scent
that
is
great
both
taste
nice
and
wheaty
a
nice
funk
the
fatali
has
a
huuuuge
pepper
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
they
are
both
really
solid
saisons
the
moth
feel
is
solid
smilar
carbonation
on
both
overall
both
are
tasty
fatali
is
incredible
compared
to
the
base
beer
very
unexpected
overall
a
great
interesting
complex
beer
this
is
the
most
drinkable
chile
beer
i
have
ever
had
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
had
d
not
always
the
biggest
chili
beer
fan
but
the
peppers
played
well
with
the
tartness
of
the
beer
and
were
not
overdone
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
ages
fatali
four
is
an
intensely
flavorful
beer
that
has
to
be
taken
slowly
or
its
sharper
intensities
can
become
overbearing
and
im
taking
it
slowly
ive
got
all
night
3

overall
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
just
might
be
too
hot
for
some
though
not
for
me
i
like
it
and
i
like
how
the
heat
sneaks
up
later
without
ruining
the
beers
great
backbone
id
say
that
the
beer
overall
was
an
interesting
combination
of
four
with
the
fatali
chilies
but
im
not
sure
id
drink
a
whole
pint
of
it
given
how
spicy
it
was
though
im
sure
it
would
have
gone
great
with
food
i
would
like
to
see
how
some
of
the
wild
yeast
notably
brett
work
on
this
beer
later
on
as
there
were
no
hints
of
it
in
the
current
profile
of
the
beer
while
ok
i
cant
say
i
found
this
to
be
a
particularly
memorable
effort
from
the
folks
at
upright
d
it
is
the
4
which
i
really
enjoy
with
a
perfectly
savorymouthwatering
warming
of
peppers
added
in
perfect
quantity
for
my
tastes
love
the
result
and
am
sad
to
see
this
one
go
among
the
more
interesting
new
beers
ive
tried
all
year
my
vote
is
cast
for
a
reappearance
in
2010
damn
this
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
ive
ever
tasted
and
this
being
the
bottom
of
the
last
keg
i
think
i
inherited
some
extra
testesenhancing
scorch
no
worries
i
can
handle
it
overall
weve
been
very
very
excited
to
get
our
hands
on
this
beer
were
it
not
due
to
the
instance
of
a
buddy
who
wanted
to
grab
some
drinks
it
may
have
taken
much
longer
to
reach
that
goal
of
finally
making
the
brief
trek
over
to
dragonmead
we
adore
spicy
chili
beers
and
since
moving
to
michigan
many
of
the
native
locals
have
pointed
us
towards
ring
of
fire
the
intrigue
has
been
built
and
expectations
made
keep
in
mind
this
was
predominantly
before
the
times
of
crime
and
punishment
so
no
real
precedent
had
been
set
what
we
encountered
here
was
a
nicely
flavored
chili
beer
at
no
point
did
it
approach
the
scalding
melting
heat
that
we
had
prepared
for
but
again
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
you
definitely
began
to
feel
the
burn
and
sweat
just
a
touch
this
does
not
ruin
the
palate
and
was
our
first
taste
of
the
night
after
which
we
were
just
fine
to
continue
tasting
the
real
prize
here
is
in
this
beers
authenticity
the
flavors
presented
are
real
and
palatable
for
the
most
part
and
you
can
tell
real
thought
and
care
went
into
developing
this
recipe
to
base
the
chili
on
top
of
their
standard
cream
ale
is
definitely
unique
and
adds
a
biscuity
and
fruity
sweetness
that
is
not
often
encountered
in
this
style
ultimately
we
are
pleased
to
have
tried
this
beer
and
believe
it
is
a
musttry
for
those
that
cant
get
enough
of
the
style
found
this
to
be
unique
and
refreshing
not
for
the
faint
hearted
pepper
presence
definitely
there
i
enjoyed
a
couple
at
this
very
laid
back
brewery
once
i
tried
it
not
to
spicy
def
had
a
kick
to
it
but
i
enjoyed
it
a
mild
taste
of
the
chile
pepper
overall
i
would
say
it
was
a
great
success
i
know
for
a
fact
i
would
not
be
able
to
finish
a
750ml
but
since
i
had
it
served
in
a
6
oz
sampler
that
was
plenty
for
me
cheers
overall
i
was
less
than
impressed
simply
because
i
expected
it
to
really
burn
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
couldnt
really
judge
it
other
than
i
liked
it
since
i
had
hung
out
at
dragonmead
for
a
few
hours
before
would
order
again
but
i
would
ahve
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
pretty
well
balanced
and
quite
tasty
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
still
good
poured
a
deeper
amber
color
with
a
small
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
green
peppers
and
just
all
around
peppers
tastes
of
peppers
initially
this
one
was
not
hot
but
the
heat
crept
up
after
you
drank
it
im
not
talking
a
cave
creek
chile
burn
but
a
lighter
pepper
burn
drather
good
but
i
dont
think
i
could
down
many
of
these
in
a
row
rather
one
dimensional
a
lot
like
liquified
jalapeno
jelly
interesting
but
certainly
not
the
best
chili
beer
i
have
ever
had
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
with
thin
white
head
average
retention
and
spotty
lacing
smells
of
malt
floral
hops
and
chili
peppers
taste
starts
off
with
some
floral
notes
with
a
honey
backbone
and
a
big
chili
pepper
spicy
finish
medium
light
in
body
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
spicy
kick
easy
to
drink
with
a
spicy
finish
good
if
you
like
a
spicy
beer
but
there
isnt
much
else
to
it
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
peppered
beer
straight
off
the
tap
in
the
brewery
looked
like
an
ordinary
ale
clear
and
golden
with
a
lightcolored
head
only
when
you
bring
it
up
to
smell
do
you
start
to
realize
that
theres
something
different
about
this
one
the
usual
hops
and
malts
come
through
but
any
other
scents
are
overpowered
by
the
distinct
scent
of
firey
peppers
taste
may
be
an
acquired
taste
but
being
a
pepper
lover
it
was
very
nice
for
me
honestly
i
didnt
notice
much
past
the
pepper
the
best
description
i
could
think
of
would
be
a
good
ale
with
peppers
in
it
strawberry
jalapeno
brown
ale
sounds
weird
right
it
tastes
so
much
better
than
it
sounds
its
got
a
perfect
balance
of
strawberry
and
jalapeno
and
the
jalapeno
is
mostly
flavor
instead
of
heat
which
compliments
the
beer
very
well
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
got
their
flight
of
8
beers
and
i
decided
it
was
the
one
i
really
wanted
some
more
of
the
most
i
will
definitely
be
back
soon
great
balance
for
having
sooooo
much
going
on
m
very
light
since
it
it
5
5
just
a
wee
bit
of
effervesce
goes
down
very
easily
since
it
is
so
tasty
not
sure
that
i
would
try
this
one
again
the
pepper
is
screaming
focus
of
this
beer
and
takes
away
from
all
other
flavors
and
tones
had
a
glass
at
the
trapp
door
in
emmaus
pa
it
might
be
more
accurate
to
call
this
a
chili
beer
since
the
jalapenos
dominate
the
flavor
of
course
strawberries
are
also
used
but
they
only
add
a
mild
fruit
sweetness
i
actually
have
trouble
pulling
brown
malt
notes
out
of
this
theres
the
clean
fresh
pepper
upfront
then
a
touch
of
subtle
fruit
esters
but
no
clean
toasted
or
roasted
maltsjust
a
slight
caramel
hit
an
interesting
beer
but
it
could
be
cleaner
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
out
it
was
an
interesting
beer
though
nothing
i
would
or
could
drink
regularly
nice
job
at
taking
a
risk
and
twist
on
the
very
boring
imo
brown
ale
overall
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
i
can
see
it
being
a
polarizing
beer
however
but
put
me
on
the
positive
side
could
use
a
little
more
hop
character
but
overall
i
enjoyed
this
unique
brew
this
beer
was
much
more
hot
than
i
was
expecting
when
something
other
than
the
sticky
makes
raul
cough
he
aint
exactly
feelin
it
decent
for
one
try
but
probably
not
again
unless
im
feeling
dangerous
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
lots
of
chile
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
earthy
chile
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
chile
heat
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
mild
chile
presence
that
is
definitely
interesting
this
beer
is
clearly
not
fir
everyone
which
includes
me
personally
the
look
is
just
fine
but
even
before
hitting
the
lips
the
smell
burns
your
nostrils
i
couldnt
make
it
more
than
three
sips
in
the
nose
is
chili
and
green
peppers
peppercorns
sweet
malts
very
spicy
heat
coming
off
the
smell
the
flavor
is
similar
more
tabasco
than
vegetal
peppers
a
little
vinegar
the
finish
is
really
thin
oily
and
a
little
seltzer
like
this
is
super
hot
really
intense
one
of
the
greats
so
unique
and
delicious
will
not
please
everybody
but
for
this
chili
head
the
heat
is
about
spot
on
and
this
offering
is
quite
enjoyable
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
contrasts
flavors
of
sweet
malts
with
spicy
chili
peppers
the
peppers
seem
to
get
a
little
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
up
but
are
in
no
way
overpowering
it
has
a
good
balance
for
a
chili
beer
good
beer
with
nice
spice
this
is
a
fine
beer
for
making
chili
and
thats
about
it
i
cant
drink
this
its
just
too
harsh
on
the
peppers
its
like
drinking
straight
pepper
juice
vomitous
rancid
my
first
straight
chili
beer
and
probably
the
last
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
similar
to
that
of
a
traditional
unfiltered
lager
yuck
yuck
yuck
yuck
and
more
yuck
great
nose
like
green
cactus
salsa
definitely
recommend
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
with
fresh
chiles
you
really
get
a
full
mouth
of
spice
and
refreshing
lager
i
love
pairing
this
with
cheeses
andor
a
nice
bowl
of
chili
on
a
cold
evening
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
good
chile
aroma
and
taste
at
first
but
it
had
that
wheatty
finish
which
tastes
like
something
rotten
to
me
the
head
was
light
fluffy
and
effervescenty
and
quickly
dissipated
birdsong
jalapeno
pale
ale
and
ballast
point
habanero
sculpin
are
way
better
those
are
the
only
other
two
peppery
beers
i
have
tried
so
far
serving
type
bottle
t
a
little
cardboard
flavor
to
start
out
slight
metallic
wet
hay
chili
and
pepper
spice
little
ascorbic
lemon
on
the
follow
keeps
palate
warm
slight
nasal
drip
from
spice
but
not
crazy
its
one
of
the
beers
you
think
chile
of
first
not
a
beer
that
happens
to
have
chiles
great
beer
if
you
like
spicy
food
o
while
its
pretty
insipid
i
think
this
would
make
a
fantastic
chili
adjunct
its
not
over
the
top
like
ghost
face
killah
yet
still
brings
a
wonderful
pepper
character
too
bad
thats
its
only
real
note
to
speak
of
try
it
once
if
you
want
o
this
beer
is
very
hot
and
spicy
but
if
you
can
handle
very
spicy
food
like
atomic
wings
it
is
manageable
this
reminds
me
a
lot
like
the
brewerys
ghost
face
killah
except
that
that
beer
has
little
drinkability
whereas
this
isnt
nearly
as
hot
because
it
doesnt
have
the
intense
heat
of
the
ghost
face
chiles
o
a
really
good
chili
beer
that
delivers
some
spice
d
of
the
other
chili
beers
ive
tried
this
is
the
best
one
it
is
what
it
is
a
chili
beer
as
for
my
chili
i
made
with
the
other
12
of
the
beer
if
was
fantastic
the
best
chili
ive
ever
made
i
will
look
for
this
beer
for
my
next
chili
overall
authentic
and
hot
with
heat
but
nothing
id
want
to
session
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
large
white
fizzy
head
that
settles
down
to
just
a
thin
line
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
lots
of
bubbles
from
the
carbonation
the
aroma
of
various
peppers
actually
anaheim
fresno
serrano
jalapeno
habenero
peppers
hits
your
nose
right
up
front
with
some
grain
the
taste
at
first
starts
out
sweet
then
the
heat
of
the
peppers
hits
your
tongue
with
some
heat
but
doesnt
last
long
after
then
the
taste
of
malt
not
overpowering
at
all
stronger
than
daves
chili
beer
with
the
single
pepper
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
overall
this
is
pretty
good
and
is
different
the
taste
is
good
peppery
and
dry
with
a
subtstantial
heat
in
the
pepper
flavor
with
a
very
light
grain
flavor
in
the
background
almost
chalky
with
a
lightly
vegetal
pepper
taste
that
lingers
after
the
swallow
the
drinkability
is
very
good
nicely
spiced
and
pretty
nice
when
paired
with
food
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
try
to
have
a
session
with
billys
chillies
though
o
overall
drinkable
nice
blend
of
peppers
a
little
sting
on
the
backend
warming
glow
of
peppers
that
make
you
aware
but
not
uncomfortable
its
a
chili
pepper
beer
plain
and
simple
it
brings
a
modest
display
of
heat
range
limited
range
of
complexity
beyond
the
peppers
and
a
novel
approach
that
is
somewhat
decent
but
may
fall
a
bit
short
of
good
this
is
one
of
the
oddest
flavor
medleys
ive
had
for
a
beer
it
is
spicy
and
unique
it
is
also
like
salsa
without
the
chunks
of
course
did
i
mention
the
burning
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
chili
lagers
that
i
have
had
there
are
better
chili
beers
available
but
they
are
almost
always
much
more
intensely
flavored
styles
of
beer
that
can
more
easily
support
the
chilies
i
didnt
find
this
one
too
hot
or
too
intense
but
not
sure
that
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
wow
what
a
beer
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
a
beer
that
was
so
interesting
the
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
white
head
that
laced
somewhat
the
scent
and
taste
was
absolutely
pepper
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
am
not
sure
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
but
boy
o
boy
its
tasty
billys
chilies
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
no
head
there
is
a
fresh
chilly
pepper
aroma
the
taste
has
a
strong
and
fresh
chilly
pepper
taste
and
finishes
with
a
kick
of
spice
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
the
only
flavors
present
are
those
of
chilies
and
the
spice
may
make
it
hard
to
drink
hard
to
drink
even
one
overall
a
good
beer
if
you
enjoy
hot
chilly
peppers
the
main
attraction
here
is
not
the
spiciness
which
im
a
glutton
for
but
the
vegetable
replication
or
should
i
say
representation
its
a
beer
for
beerlovers
who
love
peppers
i
love
peppers
so
does
my
girlfriend
this
beer
is
indeed
for
us
and
we
both
really
enjoy
drinking
it
drinking
this
at
the
brewery
this
beer
has
five
peppers
in
it
so
it
pours
up
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
as
mall
white
head
aroma
of
serrano
and
jalapeños
the
peppers
dominate
the
nose
taste
of
pale
malts
and
peppers
i
love
it
just
a
kiss
of
spice
light
bodied
very
smooth
great
pepper
beer
the
aroma
consisted
of
smoked
chilies
medium
bodied
a
foundation
of
cereal
grains
much
like
a
simple
lager
spicy
hot
chili
peppers
come
through
right
away
and
dominate
the
brew
not
a
lot
of
balance
or
complexity
recommended
for
style
as
you
can
imagine
there
was
a
very
distinct
aroma
and
taste
to
this
beer
it
was
infused
with
5
different
peppers
and
they
spicy
after
taste
lets
you
know
theyre
there
interesting
but
not
a
favorite
by
any
means
this
is
a
decent
chili
beer
its
a
bit
simple
though
it
has
a
great
pepper
flavor
which
i
think
could
be
utilized
in
a
more
flavorful
beer
to
make
something
a
bit
more
intriguing
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
but
i
did
enjoy
it
for
what
it
was
this
time
around
light
head
solid
lacing
wheres
the
breakfast
burrito
indeed
the
breweries
site
recommends
this
beer
with
a
breakfast
burrito
felt
like
some
hot
pepper
jack
cheese
and
a
butter
cracker
would
be
a
great
compliment
as
well
distinct
almost
burning
nose
very
noticeable
although
not
intense
chili
flavor
all
down
the
throat
full
flavor
fun
great
accessible
experimental
beer
four
days
after
we
tried
it
i
still
find
myself
craving
this
beer
i
should
start
by
saying
this
is
not
my
favorite
genre
of
beer
however
this
is
a
well
made
pepper
beer
as
they
go
5
types
of
peppers
are
used
here
and
you
can
feel
the
heat
it
pours
an
unassuming
pale
color
with
an
average
white
head
the
nose
is
chili
hot
with
some
pale
malt
backing
the
flavor
is
in
my
opinion
overpoweringly
hot
not
as
brutal
as
the
ghostface
but
its
intese
capsaicin
right
off
the
bat
fortunately
it
doesnt
last
that
long
in
its
most
intense
form
and
mellows
with
the
malts
until
the
finish
where
it
leaves
a
powerful
heat
on
the
throat
and
lips
i
know
some
people
get
off
on
these
but
this
just
isnt
for
me
the
mouthfeel
would
be
fine
if
it
werent
for
all
that
residual
heat
overall
a
cool
beer
for
those
interested
but
it
was
just
too
hot
for
me
i
poured
this
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
straw
color
body
with
a
small
very
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
crazy
of
green
chilies
and
serrano
chilies
but
nothing
else
cuz
the
chili
smell
is
very
powering
the
taste
is
strictly
chili
pepper
taste
up
front
but
not
extreme
heat
though
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
and
leave
a
nice
pepperyburning
sensation
in
your
mouth
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
would
recomend
it
to
somebody
who
want
to
try
something
different
and
out
of
the
ordinary
o
a
good
chilie
beer
not
too
overwhelming
which
is
nice
and
makes
it
still
drinkable
o
fairly
good
pepper
beer
overall
taste
is
a
little
lacking
but
has
a
nice
pepper
flavor
to
it
surprisingly
powerful
pepper
smell
color
is
a
bit
cloudy
nothing
remarkable
first
taste
is
a
light
smooth
beer
but
then
a
strong
pepper
after
taste
that
actually
packs
a
punch
of
heat
i
had
never
ever
heard
of
a
chile
beer
until
i
tried
this
one
i
definitely
want
to
try
another
d
if
you
like
the
pepper
flavored
ones
yes
if
you
were
hopeful
to
find
some
more
beer
favor
not
so
much
overall
good
take
on
the
style
im
impressed
with
this
one
from
twisted
pine
m
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
similar
to
the
juice
you
get
in
canned
jalapenos
with
some
sweet
biscuit
malt
also
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
bread
and
jalapeno
notes
that
burns
the
throat
as
it
goes
down
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
one
of
the
better
hot
and
spicy
beers
i
have
tried
its
a
decent
looking
beer
a
fairly
carbonated
golden
color
with
plenty
of
floaties
that
are
prevalent
enough
to
cloud
it
decent
sized
head
that
doesnt
last
long
aroma
of
chilis
and
light
malts
the
taste
is
just
about
what
id
expect
from
the
style
light
pale
malts
and
a
touch
of
caramel
at
first
followed
by
a
firm
chili
pepper
heat
that
lingers
through
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
the
drinkability
is
about
what
youd
expect
a
very
good
chili
beer
that
delivers
what
i
want
from
the
style
chilis
and
beer
that
said
i
didnt
really
find
this
one
hot
maybe
thats
what
its
big
brother
ghost
face
killah
is
for
and
go
figure
i
have
one
in
the
fridge
but
thats
a
tale
for
another
day
o
this
is
a
nice
chilie
beer
not
too
hot
and
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
great
chili
beer
perfect
to
have
with
some
hot
wings
a
bowl
of
chili
surprise
or
as
a
compliment
to
any
other
spicy
food
you
might
like
dr
as
my
first
chili
beer
its
not
bad
that
said
its
too
simple
and
boring
i
do
like
the
spice
on
the
finish
however
really
only
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
the
style
d
id
drink
this
one
again
though
its
not
sessionable
by
any
stretch
i
compliment
the
brewers
for
attempting
to
build
a
chili
beer
around
a
decent
foundation
certainly
the
best
attempt
at
the
style
ive
come
across
conclusion
my
first
chilie
beer
and
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
i
love
hot
food
and
almost
any
type
of
chilie
i
have
ever
tasted
and
of
course
i
love
beer
so
the
two
together
is
very
tasty
for
this
particular
beer
however
i
could
go
for
more
chilie
flavor
and
heat
but
the
way
it
is
works
well
too
overall
interesting
for
sure
but
i
think
it
could
use
some
work
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
one
at
a
liquor
store
recently
to
drink
next
to
ghost
face
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
aromas
of
biscuit
light
chiles
and
sweet
malt
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
little
heat
and
flavors
of
chiles
biscuit
and
sweet
malt
overall
this
is
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
this
is
like
a
good
or
at
least
better
version
of
cave
creek
chili
beer
the
brew
is
a
pale
strawgold
translucent
and
generally
projects
an
adjunct
lager
look
aside
from
the
pepper
addition
it
is
like
an
aal
in
all
respects
the
nose
is
quite
akin
to
the
spicy
nacho
cheese
cup
that
you
get
with
the
chips
at
the
movie
theater
it
is
not
bad
however
it
is
more
like
a
guilty
pleasure
or
a
harkening
to
days
past
the
flavor
reiterates
the
theme
with
equal
parts
cornchip
and
spicy
serranojalapeno
flavor
it
is
admittedly
just
a
hairs
breadth
away
from
being
a
debacle
and
yet
it
retains
that
hairs
distance
above
it
is
in
that
precise
nailing
of
flavor
that
billys
chilies
makes
its
mark
it
is
not
just
gimmicky
it
is
a
paradigm
of
frilladded
merchandise
ah
yes
a
chili
beer
i
love
unconventional
ingredients
in
beers
and
nothing
says
unorthodox
than
five
different
hot
pepper
tastes
crammed
into
one
12
ounce
bottle
pours
a
rich
auburn
color
with
a
tight
head
the
smell
is
spicey
with
caspian
and
light
pineness
taste
was
what
i
hoped
for
i
could
almost
feel
the
flame
roasted
pepper
skins
on
my
tongue
nice
heat
but
not
overpowering
with
some
light
hopping
in
the
background
it
was
a
little
hard
to
distinguish
the
different
peppers
but
i
still
loved
it
great
beer
twisted
pine
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
not
more
than
one
and
not
every
day
but
every
week
or
so
with
mexican
or
other
spicy
food
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
if
you
dont
like
spicy
food
or
hot
peppers
than
this
isnt
going
to
change
your
mind
as
someone
who
loves
spicy
food
this
is
a
true
delight
sure
the
taste
isnt
that
great
and
the
beer
itself
feels
a
bit
on
the
slimy
side
but
none
of
that
matters
when
that
scoville
rush
hits
so
far
this
is
the
finest
example
of
a
chili
beer
ive
ever
had
afternote
the
first
beer
was
ok
but
two
of
the
subsequent
beers
of
the
six
pack
were
real
gushers
when
opened
it
might
be
a
good
idea
for
people
to
open
this
over
a
sink
to
prevent
sadness
a
very
interesting
beer
the
name
gives
away
the
chili
aspect
pretty
spicy
i
love
spicy
food
but
i
am
not
sure
about
my
beer
with
the
right
meal
this
could
be
a
fabulous
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
have
a
few
in
my
fridge
for
mexican
food
night
otherwise
its
a
bit
intense
on
my
stomach
for
my
beer
likes
im
not
sure
id
like
the
next
morning
on
a
john
after
six
of
these
guys
t
lightly
sweet
malt
up
front
with
a
little
bit
of
herbal
hop
character
the
chili
pepper
flavors
come
on
strong
in
the
middle
with
lots
of
roasted
pepper
flavor
and
some
subtle
spiciness
the
beer
finishes
with
dry
bre
d
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
what
it
is
it
is
not
a
beer
that
you
are
going
to
sit
down
and
want
to
drink
all
night
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
regular
beer
id
be
interested
to
see
how
this
beer
pairs
with
food
a
weird
beer
but
not
bad
the
5
chile
peppers
laggerish
lighter
mouthfeel
lighter
colour
and
a
little
too
carbonated
still
some
pepper
aroma
and
taste
would
be
greater
with
food
must
try
but
one
dimensional
a
germ
killer
can
pour
onto
food
drink
lots
of
water
afterwards
d
easy
drinking
seems
like
the
abv
is
low
can
be
a
little
bit
filling
flavors
are
certainly
potent
and
dominating
but
surprisingly
the
chilies
dont
create
a
residual
hotness
goes
well
with
pizza
generic
mild
beer
taste
as
the
description
on
the
bottle
so
accurately
suggests
on
the
front
end
of
the
palate
quickly
turning
bold
and
spicy
im
quite
impressed
by
the
sheer
true
spicy
peppery
character
a
slight
lingering
burn
reminds
me
of
what
i
just
drank
a
pretty
decent
beer
paired
well
with
fajitas
d
this
would
go
great
with
chili
or
in
chili
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
refreshing
actually
the
taste
is
spicy
from
start
to
finish
though
it
never
overwhelmed
me
i
like
the
body
of
it
its
got
a
decent
amount
for
what
it
is
i
cant
say
it
tastes
beery
as
the
the
label
suggests
but
i
dont
need
it
to
im
not
rushing
to
the
fridge
for
another
but
i
finished
this
one
rather
quickly
you
probably
want
to
be
acclamated
to
spice
before
diving
in
nose
and
tongue
first
yum
the
flavor
starts
out
sweet
with
some
pale
malts
and
light
hoppiness
the
peppers
taste
crisp
and
initially
fresh
as
in
the
aroma
and
remind
me
of
biting
into
a
cold
pepper
seed
the
finish
is
where
this
beer
shines
as
the
heat
kicks
in
with
a
spicy
warmth
that
reminds
me
of
a
good
fresh
salsa
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
in
both
body
and
carbonation
which
allows
the
delicateness
of
the
peppers
to
do
their
thang
all
in
all
a
very
welldone
chile
beer
from
an
otherwise
unimpressive
twisted
pine
brewco
dno
thanks
ill
be
lucky
to
finish
the
glass
this
beer
is
anything
but
savory
and
i
cant
ever
say
that
one
sip
has
convinced
me
whether
i
wish
to
finish
but
i
dont
think
im
going
to
take
another
sip
you
accomplished
your
goal
but
id
rather
stick
to
beer
that
tastes
like
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
16
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
strong
chili
but
not
fresh
chili
and
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
chile
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
chili
slight
yeast
and
slight
pale
malt
the
chili
does
not
seem
to
be
fresh
and
is
so
strong
as
to
throw
off
any
hope
of
a
good
blend
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
small
white
film
on
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
was
of
jalapenos
the
flavor
was
also
of
jalapenos
with
just
a
little
bit
of
heat
with
it
i
didnt
think
it
was
that
hot
but
i
have
a
pretty
high
tolerance
for
hot
and
spicy
food
or
drink
i
liked
it
but
definitely
not
a
beer
for
everybody
probably
would
not
drink
more
than
2
consecutive
this
is
like
a
typical
but
spicy
lager
but
the
spicy
flavors
add
enough
to
pull
it
above
a
typical
beer
and
make
it
interesting
if
you
like
spicy
things
give
this
a
go
with
out
question
i
am
in
no
way
a
parishioner
of
spicy
anything
but
i
find
this
to
be
a
welcomed
oddity
to
my
usually
fair
may
not
be
heaven
may
lean
toward
hell
in
essence
but
its
worth
a
try
no
matter
where
your
faith
lies
as
expected
a
chile
taste
green
serrano
pepper
taste
with
some
green
vine
some
flower
enters
just
as
the
end
comes
in
with
a
good
chile
spice
on
the
hot
side
as
it
finishes
but
tame
let
me
preface
this
by
saying
i
am
a
pretty
big
fan
of
chile
beers
i
have
even
brewed
them
a
time
or
two
myself
this
one
has
got
quite
a
bit
of
heat
not
surprised
if
they
did
indeed
use
any
amount
of
habanero
andor
serrano
there
is
some
mild
sweet
grainy
malts
up
front
coupled
with
a
nice
earthy
pepper
flavor
the
finish
does
have
a
little
bitterness
to
it
but
quickly
followed
up
by
some
heat
and
not
just
a
bit
the
heat
really
does
not
stay
in
the
mouth
but
rather
migrates
to
the
back
of
the
throat
and
lingers
there
for
quite
some
time
i
like
it
and
feel
it
ranks
above
average
for
the
style
might
be
a
tad
too
hot
though
as
just
as
much
pepper
flavor
can
be
achieved
without
the
fire
in
almost
every
aspect
smell
taste
mouthfeel
this
is
merely
an
underhopped
clone
of
bud
light
but
one
that
has
been
doused
in
fiery
vegetable
flavors
that
completely
destroy
any
reminants
of
a
drinkable
beer
drinkability
a
well
done
beer
is
a
well
done
beer
and
this
is
the
new
standard
bearer
for
the
style
for
me
i
love
the
heat
this
one
brings
and
i
can
feel
the
burn
well
after
i
have
tasted
my
last
sip
that
being
said
this
is
a
sipper
this
has
a
more
complex
pepper
taste
to
it
than
most
pepper
beers
i
would
have
this
one
again
ddrinkable
but
not
something
i
would
choose
to
have
a
bunch
of
in
one
sitting
if
it
were
a
little
more
consistent
this
could
potentially
be
the
best
chili
beer
around
as
it
is
its
still
a
contender
considering
the
other
really
good
ones
have
been
taponly
like
sigdas
from
coopersmiths
this
is
the
best
bottled
version
ive
had
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
great
example
of
a
chili
beer
if
your
only
experience
with
chilis
in
beer
is
that
eds
cave
creek
abomination
give
this
one
a
shot
itll
make
you
forget
that
eds
even
exists
which
is
a
good
thing
well
balanced
well
made
a
remarkable
albeit
somewhat
gimmicky
beer
from
twisted
pine
wow
they
arent
kidding
when
they
say
chilies
this
is
by
far
the
spiciest
chili
beer
i
have
had
the
other
reviewers
have
it
covered
about
the
only
thing
i
taste
is
hot
peppers
and
cigarettes
interesting
for
a
couple
sips
but
now
i
need
a
new
beer
maybe
this
would
be
good
to
cook
with
though
perhaps
in
some
chili
or
in
the
water
pan
of
a
meat
smoker
or
any
other
bbq
scenario
where
adding
beer
is
desired
drinkability
interesting
concept
that
perhaps
goes
better
with
spicy
food
or
then
again
perhaps
not
the
appearance
was
good
with
the
head
that
came
off
and
then
reduced
to
thin
lacing
the
smell
had
some
hops
to
it
but
then
the
chilies
came
to
power
the
taste
was
just
pure
chili
if
you
want
nothing
else
to
taste
but
chilies
this
would
create
a
dream
beer
for
you
but
as
i
enjoy
the
combination
of
all
the
different
aspects
of
a
beer
this
one
lacked
everything
that
in
my
mind
makes
a
beer
overall
impression
ive
had
some
decent
chili
beers
in
the
paste
but
this
one
isnt
something
ill
be
getting
again
it
is
lacking
in
flavor
and
only
has
some
chili
aroma
and
burn
going
for
it
mouthfeel
is
hot
spicy
that
is
pretty
gross
sorry
i
just
dont
have
that
much
to
add
its
peppers
its
hot
its
a
spicy
salsa
beer
hmmmm
drank
easy
this
amicas
chilles
beer
are
the
2
best
ive
had
would
go
great
with
texmex
or
bbq
the
flavor
was
in
a
word
awful
i
cant
say
ive
had
other
chile
beers
and
this
example
will
make
me
think
twice
before
i
do
after
this
beer
the
fact
that
i
have
a
bottle
of
rogue
chipotle
in
the
fridge
is
terrifying
if
you
like
chile
peppers
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
beer
drinker
beware
this
beer
is
freakin
hot
smells
hot
tastes
even
hotter
dont
say
i
didnt
warn
you
this
was
punishing
to
drink
two
sips
and
then
down
the
drain
i
suspect
that
the
brewer
had
some
very
bad
beer
and
decided
to
cover
the
flavor
with
peppers
i
hope
they
didnt
waste
good
beer
when
making
this
pepper
heat
renders
this
beer
undrinkable
for
normal
humans
overall
a
powerful
chile
beer
but
you
had
damn
well
be
able
to
tolerate
hot
peppers
way
too
hot
great
flavor
very
peppery
but
smooth
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
spice
dont
bother
probably
great
for
a
beer
batter
simmering
sausages
or
brats
and
marinades
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
huge
head
that
dies
down
very
very
quickly
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
very
hot
peppers
and
kind
of
has
a
mexican
salsa
type
of
feel
to
it
ive
had
pepper
beers
before
but
this
one
smells
hardcore
i
took
a
sip
and
before
even
swallowing
the
beer
the
heat
started
kicking
in
wow
holy
shit
if
you
dont
like
spicy
definitely
stay
away
from
this
brew
spice
lingers
on
the
throat
this
is
a
beer
you
would
want
to
deglaze
maybe
a
mexican
pasta
dish
in
the
pan
with
it
would
provide
killer
flavor
this
should
be
considered
a
cooking
ingredient
not
very
palate
friendly
in
my
opinion
just
drinking
it
straight
like
this
the
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
there
is
no
balance
no
sweetness
no
hop
presence
just
straight
heat
if
it
had
some
sweetness
to
even
some
of
this
heat
out
it
would
be
a
better
beer
hands
down
mouthfeel
is
of
a
lager
overall
just
not
a
good
beer
great
for
a
uniqueness
and
interesting
factor
just
not
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
adding
some
type
of
food
that
is
savory
to
go
with
it
cost
3
99
for
a
12
oz
bottle
stay
the
hell
away
from
this
dont
even
think
about
it
youve
been
warned
the
poor
was
a
nice
amber
with
a
bit
of
lace
that
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
was
sharp
and
overwhelming
and
i
could
not
discern
any
hops
or
malt
over
the
roasted
pepper
while
i
enjoy
spicy
food
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
find
spicy
beer
less
than
tolerable
i
saw
this
as
more
of
a
novelty
but
i
digress
if
a
pepper
beer
is
what
you
are
looking
for
you
may
enjoy
this
but
i
personally
found
it
to
be
just
an
unpleasant
assault
on
the
senses
not
too
bad
flavor
first
half
of
taste
time
the
second
half
of
the
flavor
time
is
a
burnt
pepper
flavor
kinda
different
nice
color
the
head
disappeared
as
soon
as
i
was
done
pouring
it
in
the
glass
not
too
hot
to
drink
a
jalapeno
has
a
similar
heat
those
who
say
it
is
hotter
are
stretching
the
truth
a
little
website
for
twistedpinebrewing
com
was
taken
down
today
it
listed
minnesota
as
selling
it
minnesota
does
not
you
can
order
it
thru
algona
iowa
and
make
a
roadtrip
like
i
did
but
at
76case
i
will
not
make
this
a
weekly
habit
you
dont
want
more
than
2
at
a
time
though
im
getting
this
beer
a
high
rating
because
it
completely
advertises
that
youre
drinking
a
hot
pepper
other
than
that
you
really
have
no
expectations
going
into
this
beer
so
if
you
want
to
drink
a
pepper
this
is
the
great
beer
for
you
so
i
will
rate
it
highly
based
on
that
i
poured
this
out
after
several
sips
it
is
somewhat
tasty
but
its
impossible
to
enjoy
due
to
the
immense
heat
good
luck
if
you
dare
attempt
to
drink
it
overall
the
hottest
pepper
beer
ever
and
the
best
how
could
i
not
try
a
beer
called
ghost
face
killah
i
have
been
craving
a
chile
beer
and
this
one
promised
to
be
spicy
i
like
spicy
but
just
could
not
finish
12
oz
of
this
based
on
the
heat
alone
not
bad
but
way
too
hot
to
be
a
goto
beer
for
me
i
might
use
it
as
a
novelty
or
give
it
to
my
enemies
this
beer
is
simply
hot
as
fuck
that
is
all
this
chile
beer
style
contains
6
different
peppers
including
anaheim
fresno
jalapeño
serrano
habenero
and
ghost
chiles
pours
a
coppery
amber
in
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
with
no
lacing
really
to
speak
of
as
well
a
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
aroma
is
of
various
hot
peppers
with
some
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
would
be
excepted
spicy
with
heat
that
makes
you
want
to
drink
it
fast
a
tad
on
the
vinegary
side
it
was
different
of
course
and
made
the
top
of
my
head
sweat
some
lol
if
hot
pepper
is
your
style
of
beer
then
here
you
go
was
pregaming
whilst
waiting
for
guests
to
arrive
for
what
turned
out
to
be
an
epic
rager
my
brother
dared
me
to
chug
this
so
i
transferred
the
liquid
from
bottle
to
nonic
style
glass
and
proceeded
to
slam
this
beer
hard
it
set
my
insides
ablaze
loved
it
pours
a
nice
gold
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
super
quick
first
whiff
will
cause
you
to
cough
initial
sip
is
pretty
good
and
you
can
taste
some
pepper
it
takes
a
secon
or
two
but
then
you
feel
the
burn
has
a
nice
body
to
it
and
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
would
not
drink
it
every
day
but
i
can
enjoy
this
once
or
twice
a
year
if
you
like
hit
and
spicy
this
beer
is
for
you
my
nose
is
still
running
as
i
write
this
overall
this
beer
is
a
novelty
im
glad
i
found
it
and
got
to
try
it
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
theres
no
malt
backbone
at
all
so
as
beer
quality
goes
its
pretty
poor
however
i
dont
think
its
meant
to
be
anything
but
a
superspicy
novelty
beer
and
it
achieves
that
very
well
but
its
worth
picking
up
once
to
try
if
only
to
say
you
did
dont
fear
the
ghost
pepper
its
nowhere
near
as
spicy
as
anything
else
ive
had
with
ghost
chiles
m
carbonation
is
fine
but
the
whole
thing
is
way
too
thin
i
feel
like
thisd
level
of
spice
would
be
better
suited
to
something
more
oily
our
creamy
i
admire
what
they
have
pulled
off
and
its
one
i
will
never
forget
i
will
probably
remember
it
very
clearly
tomorrow
as
well
its
clear
yellowish
gold
with
no
head
and
a
maddening
and
confusing
slam
of
heat
and
sting
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazed
golden
coloring
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
no
head
aromas
of
peppers
forward
and
bold
wowzers
you
get
a
lot
of
the
dark
and
roasted
notes
of
the
serrano
and
anaheim
peppers
but
also
the
noseblistering
sheer
heat
from
the
ghost
face
and
habanero
it
smells
hot
as
shit
but
i
like
that
kind
of
thing
which
explains
my
mouth
watering
right
now
flavors
are
kind
of
mild
initially
with
a
warming
and
pepper
spice
on
the
backbone
but
that
is
immediately
followed
up
with
a
blast
of
hot
both
in
spice
and
actual
temperature
there
is
a
goldenstyle
type
flavor
somewhere
in
there
but
it
gets
absolutely
pummeled
by
the
cascade
of
pepper
spice
and
heat
the
body
is
light
and
smooth
and
the
aftertaste
is
wait
for
it
peppers
again
more
spice
than
anything
but
the
heat
remains
throughout
as
well
only
starting
to
subside
in
the
finish
the
finish
is
fairly
quick
and
somewhat
unremarkable
based
on
the
fact
that
your
taste
buds
are
shot
at
this
point
this
was
a
fun
one
to
try
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
and
im
sure
ill
regret
it
tomorrow
but
i
would
recommended
you
try
it
o
this
is
not
a
beer
for
drinking
but
maybe
it
would
be
good
as
a
base
for
chili
or
just
forget
it
it
sucks
o
overall
the
beer
is
just
way
too
hot
although
i
suppose
that
that
is
kinda
the
point
interesting
to
experience
but
make
sure
you
have
at
least
4
other
people
with
you
to
split
this
with
or
dump
the
whole
thing
into
a
pot
of
beans
and
beef
and
make
some
damn
spicy
chili
overall
score
is
low
simply
because
you
cant
finish
the
damn
thing
o
this
beer
actually
has
nice
complexity
in
the
smell
and
taste
for
a
chili
beer
as
you
can
detect
sever
of
the
different
types
of
peppers
however
i
would
consider
this
to
be
undrinkable
unless
you
are
a
person
that
can
easily
handle
buffalo
wings
with
suicidal
hot
sauce
i
wish
this
had
some
body
or
even
a
pinch
of
sweetness
there
is
nothing
beer
tasting
about
this
not
even
any
malt
presence
to
back
it
up
for
novelty
or
chili
heads
only
not
for
beer
fans
o
this
is
definitely
a
novelty
beer
and
not
exactly
a
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
but
others
like
myself
thought
it
was
flaming
hot
the
flavor
wasnt
all
that
bad
before
the
incredible
heat
set
in
but
it
is
what
it
is
a
novelty

its
for
those
with
an
affinity
for
heat
this
beer
packs
the
heat
unlike
any
other
beer
i
have
tried
as
someone
who
enjoys
spicy
foods
unless
eating
whole
habaneros
is
your
thing
its
definitely
not
overly
spicy
though

it

an
unassuming
lazy
light
amber
color
with
a

white

nothinig

right

hey
benny
and
actually
hurts
a

overall
i

what
it

doesnt

i
would
recommend
picked
up
only
1
12oz
bottle
of
this
i
shared
with
over
half
the
bar
a
blue
grass
event
and
no
one
could
go
back
for
seconds
after
their
less
than
2oz
pour
i
definitely
suggest
buying
this
just
to
find
out
how
hot
a
chili
beer
can
really
be
unreal
do
drinkability
is
low
this
is
a
beer
in
which
a
little
goes
a
long
long
way
ive
had
this
glass
in
front
of
me
for
almost
30
minutes
and
i
probably
drank
maybe
3oz
the
heat
is
intense
but
after
letting
it
mellow
on
the
mouth
it
gradually
fades
into
a
dull
heat
throb
which
isnt
so
bad
actually
honestly
split
this
because
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
a
whole
bottle
of
this
solo
i
am
probably
going
to
put
the
rest
back
into
the
glass
and
cook
with
it
or
something
liquid
heat
yellow
body
with
rapidly
dissipating
white
foamy
head
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
my
chile
beers
but
this
is
something
burning
pain
i
am
writing
this
5
hours
later
and
still
feeling
it
its
absolutely
not
too
drinkable
so
the
rest
of
it
is
going
into
my
slow
cooking
stew
for
later
in
the
week
o
interesting
beer
to
try
once
i
split
this
12oz
beer
three
ways
with
two
buddies
and
not
one
of
us
could
finish
it
was
not
even
a
bit
pleasurable
drinking
it
had
to
chase
it
with
another
beer
just
crazy
hot
and
i
enjoy
my
share
of
spice
and
kick
this
beer
was
fun
but
cmon
man
off
top
this
is
a
novelty
beer
golden
color
looks
like
a
beer
the
smell
gives
a
very
good
indicator
of
what
you
can
expect
smoky
peppers
just
foreboding
in
every
sense
of
the
word
the
flavor
is
smoky
pepper
maybe
that
is
the
serrano
it
then
quickly
morphs
into
heat
that
is
not
a
joke
i
love
hot
foods
so
this
did
not
phase
me
but
make
no
mistake
this
beer
is
hot
and
you
will
feel
it
in
your
tongue
i
had
to
try
this
beer
because
i
have
had
good
chile
beers
from
coopersmiths
and
stone
11
11
11
but
i
wont
revisit
this
a
crazy
feat
of
a
beer
that
i
respect
the
hell
out
of
of
but
i
dont
think
this
will
be
anything
i
stock
up
on
i
have
another
bottle
ill
certainly
drink
but
im
still
more
intrigued
about
the
possibility
of
using
it
in
cooking
more
than
drinking
it
o
as
far
as
chile
beers
go
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
a
fun
tick
at
the
very
least
when
poured
this
looks
like
your
average
beer
but
then
you
smell
it
and
it
is
all
peppers
no
hops
no
malt
just
hot
hot
peppers
taste
is
more
of
the
same
i
appreciated
how
the
peppers
retained
their
own
character
there
was
definite
complexity
within
the
pepper
flavor
but
that
was
all
i
tasted
and
it
was
extremely
spicy
it
flooded
my
entire
mouth
and
throat
with
hot
spicy
tingling
the
mouthfeel
just
shot
hot
hot
heat
all
around
and
the
carbonation
just
made
the
spiciness
explode
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
am
not
big
on
spicy
foods
but
i
was
surprised
by
how
well
they
captured
the
complexities
of
the
chiles
used
if
you
like
chiles
and
hot
foods
you
should
definitely
seek
this
out
o
cool
beer
to
try
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
in
the
future
all
these
pansies
talking
about
acid
reflux
and
indigestion
wasnt
caused
by
this
beer
a
buddy
and
i
finished
a
half
bottle
each
with
no
problems
and
no
seering
pain
or
anything
it
is
definitely
hot
with
what
i
call
a
pleasant
tingle
in
the
mouth
base
beer
is
solid
and
the
peppers
take
the
frontstage
i
traded
for
more
after
i
picked
up
the
first
couple
bottles
thanks
goes
to
who
ever
killed
the
bottle
in
my
glass
on
a
post
note
i
eat
a
ton
of
spicey
food
and
have
a
very
high
tolerance
the
sheer
acidity
of
this
beer
though
caused
me
massive
heartburn
an
unusual
thing
that
forced
me
to
go
out
at
430
am
for
zantac
if
you
feel
the
need
to
tick
this
beware
o
well
the
name
is
cool
and
its
fn
hot
so
i
think
they
pretty
much
captured
what
they
went
out
to
do
here
i
couldnt
drink
much
but
its
def
asadvertisted
hot
a
shit
if
you
like
hot
salsa
or
anything
with
peppers
try
this
hurts
to
drink
so
thats
a
negative
d
12oz
bottle
was
split
5
ways
an
no
one
was
successful
in
finishing
his
or
her
pour
ended
up
making
a
wonderful
cuvée
when
blended
with
infected
shorts
pb
j
i
had
horrendous
reflux
for
the
rest
of
the
night
and
into
the
early
morning
avoid
unless
you
are
a
masochist
this
is
punishment
no
enjoyment
can
really
be
had
here
especially
not
being
a
hot
head
glad
to
have
tried
it
i
think
o
i
hope
to
i
never
cross
paths
with
this
thing
again
but
im
glad
i
got
to
tick
this
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
rate
since
it
is
so
unlike
most
other
beers
but
i
did
like
it
overall
yes
sir
its
a
chile
beer
alright
and
an
expected
undertaking
to
finish
off
my
helping
pour
looks
like
you
would
expect
a
macro
lager
to
look
like
yellow
and
fizzy
aroma
of
peppers
abounds
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
at
first
corny
then
gives
way
to
the
peppers
not
to
hot
but
defanatly
has
some
heat
to
it
swish
it
around
in
you
mouth
for
a
bit
a
lot
of
jalapeño
and
ancho
flavor
is
strong
to
me
good
for
a
pepper
beer
would
like
to
try
a
freshie
o
pretty
cool
since
it
has
the
ghost
chili
in
it
and
seeing
the
guy
from
man
vs
food
almost
kill
himself
eating
them
i
drink
just
a
bit
of
this
one
and
my
stomach
felt
it
id
say
this
one
would
be
really
hard
to
drink
im
a
huge
fan
of
chile
beers
but
only
if
theyre
beers
flavored
with
peppers
not
just
liquid
heat
this
is
one
of
the
stupidest
beers
ever
deliberately
made
overall
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
for
me
i
am
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
its
best
pepper
beer
i
have
ever
had
too
hot
for
my
liking
but
that
was
this
beers
purpose
pepper
beers
are
just
not
my
thing
nice
light
amber
pour
gave
way
to
there
was
a
slight
bit
of
pepper
way
in
the
back
but
it
was
not
dominating
by
any
means
the
initial
sip
was
a
work
of
art
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
sugar
roll
across
the
tongue
with
a
lively
and
well
carbonated
feel
that
really
lets
the
flavor
pop
moving
through
you
start
to
feel
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
a
warming
in
the
throat
and
a
fire
in
the
belly
subtly
the
chili
comes
through
warming
you
as
it
goes
but
by
no
means
is
this
too
big
this
is
perfectly
blended
in
the
flavor
rising
subtly
to
a
crescendo
that
then
backs
down
as
easy
as
it
came
up
really
very
well
done
here
after
taste
of
peppery
notes
hints
of
chocolate
as
well
coming
through
and
leaving
a
long
lasting
tingling
feeling
that
was
hard
to
ignore
awesome
feel
on
this
one
about
as
good
as
you
can
get
and
the
drinkability
was
more
then
decent
given
the
style
at
hand
one
of
the
first
and
actually
the
only
of
its
kind
that
i
was
able
to
put
down
with
some
form
of
regularity
o
a
very
good
gimmick
beverage
this
really
doesnt
taste
like
beer
though
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
or
recommend
it
to
others
unless
theyre
interested
in
the
gimmick
itself
pours
clear
gold
with
white
head
smells
of
pretty
much
nothing
but
fresh
chili
peppers
and
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
chili
peppers
no
other
flavor
components
to
speak
of
this
beer
does
not
burn
your
tongue
but
builds
up
quite
a
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
after
a
couple
sips
really
not
sure
what
the
point
of
making
this
beer
is
not
worth
seeking
out
unless
youre
attracted
to
the
gimmick
factor
666
overall
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
it
goes
without
saying
that
i
wont
be
drinking
a
half
dozen
of
these
on
a
hot
day
but
as
far
as
the
style
goes
i
think
they
nailed
it
overall
while
i
feel
that
this
is
a
great
showcase
for
the
chiles
i
still
would
not
want
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
or
possibly
ever
again
still
im
glad
i
tried
it
at
least
the
name
and
label
is
cool
overall
ill
say
what
i
said
about
billys
chilis
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
not
more
than
one
at
a
time
and
not
every
day
but
goes
well
with
mexican
or
other
spicy
food
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
if
you
dont
like
spicy
food
or
hot
peppers
than
this
isnt
going
to
change
your
mind
very
similiar
to
twisted
pines
other
chiliy
beer
just
a
more
intense
and
longer
lasting
heat
o
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
i
believe
the
hype
and
buildup
is
a
little
over
the
top
for
the
actual
payoff
there
is
some
additional
heat
from
the
ghost
pepper
but
not
so
much
as
to
warrant
seeking
this
out
over
their
billys
chilies
melted
my
mind
overall
its
a
completely
one
dimensional
beer
its
all
about
the
heat
and
the
chilis
but
its
definitely
the
hottest
beer
ive
had
its
not
as
bad
a
ghost
pepper
sauces
ive
had
though
golden
yellow
beer
that
is
moderately
clear
small
carbonation
bubbles
noticeable
but
nothing
for
head
retention
aroma
is
chile
and
green
bell
peppers
with
onions
flavor
is
initially
a
crisp
lager
but
is
immediately
decimated
by
heat
while
the
heat
is
pleasantly
strong
it
is
all
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
and
very
monotone
not
the
best
chile
beer
out
there
but
there
are
many
worse
ones
o
a
fun
novelty
beer
ive
had
hotter
homebrewed
stuff
glad
to
have
tried
it
once
but
will
not
seek
out
again
this
is
pretty
much
pepper
water
no
discernible
beer
qualities
here
besides
appearance
mouthfeel
sort
of
obvious
from
the
taste
editupdate
tried
another
bottle
was
still
not
impressed
amazing
i
have
very
little
experience
with
the
ghost
chili
but
this
actually
has
me
even
more
scared
of
it
if
jolokia
can
transfer
this
much
pepper
heat
into
a
beer
the
real
thing
must
be
deadly
good
beer
for
those
who
like
spice
or
for
a
good
redbeer
cheers
poured
a
light
straw
color
with
a
very
smallish
white
head
this
beer
is
essentially
billies
chiles
dryhopped
with
ghost
chiles
nice
smokey
aromas
roasted
hatch
chiles
and
light
straw
on
the
palate
this
one
is
very
light
and
drinkable
with
flavors
of
smoke
fresh
chiles
and
roasted
hatch
chiles
with
some
slowly
building
heat
on
the
back
of
the
throat
not
nearly
as
hot
as
i
was
led
to
believe
but
a
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
chili
beer
edit
after
having
a
full
bottle
last
night
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
have
changed
my
rating
a
bit
o
really
cool
beer
im
surprised
by
the
smokepeatrauchbier
taste
but
it
works
really
well
here
the
fact
that
you
can
taste
the
jalapenos
is
perfect
if
this
is
a
gimmick
at
least
you
can
taste
the
gimmick
and
for
me
its
not
a
gimmick
this
brew
is
just
begging
to
be
paired
with
some
food
tacos
or
cheese
or
something
with
a
name
like
don
jalapeno
though
i
guess
i
dont
get
what
everyone
else
expected
i
love
it
not
bad
a
very
texan
concept
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
might
be
perfect
for
cinco
de
mayo
pours
a
orange
amber
with
a
nice
head
smell
is
definitely
jalapeno
and
the
taste
is
definitely
jalapeno
with
a
decent
burn
not
too
much
body
or
other
flavor
but
for
those
who
like
a
spicy
beer
this
beer
delivers
a
true
jalapeno
beer
that
they
really
nailed
in
terms
of
delivering
jalapeno
d
i
thought
this
was
great
it
had
the
right
level
of
spice
without
going
into
gimmick
territory
you
can
still
taste
the
base
beer
and
it
integrates
nicely
with
the
peppery
flavors
would
happily
drink
this
again
although
itd
be
hard
to
have
more
than
a
bottle
in
an
evening
thanks
beerhunter76
for
the
opportunity
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
biscuit
malt
and
fresh
green
jalapeno
peppers
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
and
about
what
i
expected
the
biscuit
malt
is
overpowered
by
the
peppers
which
are
also
accompanied
by
a
little
bit
of
grass
unlike
some
other
pepper
beers
the
chilis
add
more
flavor
than
they
do
heat
which
in
this
case
is
a
good
thing
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
must
if
you
like
pepper
beers
light
crisp
slight
heat
do
not
hesitate
to
try
if
you
find
it
the
beer
pours
and
oranging
gold
with
a
little
head
of
medium
sized
white
bubbles
the
head
leaves
little
to
no
lacing
in
body
the
beer
is
slightly
hazy
though
clean
and
free
of
particles
and
is
full
of
lazy
bubbles
working
their
way
to
the
head
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
clean
and
peppery
like
the
flesh
of
a
jalapeno
fresh
out
of
the
garden
light
bready
malts
also
appear
lightly
in
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
spicy
and
softly
sweet
with
light
touches
of
acidity
on
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
in
flavor
the
beer
tastes
of
fresh
jalapeno
spicy
and
fleshy
with
light
vegetal
skin
notes
that
are
beautiful
on
the
tongue
light
cracker
malt
can
also
be
felt
as
a
cream
on
the
sides
of
the
taste
balancing
and
cooling
the
spicy
flavors
the
finish
brings
the
largest
touch
of
bready
malt
but
the
jalapeno
flavors
return
in
the
aftertaste
and
give
a
nice
lingering
spice
to
the
mouth
alongside
a
slight
plastic
flavor
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
with
a
light
jelling
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
softer
but
bites
at
the
beginning
of
the
sip
after
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
wet
with
spice
and
acid
canceling
saliva
overall
this
beer
is
refreshingly
unique
with
some
awesome
pepper
flavors
that
would
do
amazingly
with
food
the
spicy
flavor
actually
dies
off
as
you
drink
more
of
it
which
is
too
bad
but
overall
this
is
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
pepper
beer
with
some
great
fleshy
pepper
flavors
a
beer
to
try
for
sure
overall
though
you
cant
deny
how
fun
this
beer
is
and
it
sells
itself
as
spicy
and
with
jalapeno
and
it
delivers
in
spades
good
times
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
thirsty
moose
a
good
drinkable
pilsner
for
me
with
turned
up
heat
a
base
of
malt
and
wheat
mostly
i
got
very
little
hops
a
nice
one
and
well
needed
to
break
through
a
taste
lull
little
colour
or
head
average
plus
mouthfeel
quite
a
creative
and
tasty
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
on
tap
at
the
nh
brewers
fest
4
oz
served
in
a
small
glass
poured
a
deep
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thinnish
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
obviously
jalapeno
as
soon
as
i
set
my
nose
over
the
glass
theres
some
sweet
bready
pilsner
malt
backing
up
the
pepper
but
it
has
a
hard
time
finding
a
voice
the
flavor
is
quite
mild
from
what
i
expected
from
the
aroma
the
pepper
is
there
up
front
but
it
is
all
flavor
with
very
little
heat
mild
bready
and
caramel
malt
sweetness
provide
a
nice
backdrop
before
the
pepper
flavor
throws
a
mild
lingering
heat
medium
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
beer
i
went
back
for
seconds
its
a
really
nice
pilsner
and
the
jalapenos
add
an
odd
but
very
flavorful
component
to
the
beer
overall
a
really
unique
and
bold
jalapeno
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
take
despite
all
the
pepper
flavors
throughout
this
manages
to
stay
away
from
being
overly
spicy
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
pretty
enjoyable
with
moderate
amount
of
heat
at
the
back
of
the
palate
o
good
brew
worth
trying
you
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
not
over
powering
chili
flavor
o
surprised
so
chocolatey
the
chili
sticks
to
your
tongue
i
will
drink
occasionally
for
a
change

try
it

only
because

by
chance
to
taste
like
a

ale
the
cool
damp
night
was
a
welcome
relief
the
scorching
sun
had
roasted
everything
within
reach
the
buzzards
that
flew
overhead
all
afternoon
had
nested
with
their
bellies
empty
if
it
was
a
tavern
it
was
long
abandoned
the
barkeep
had
a
dressing
wrapped
around
his
head
at
least
three
times
covering
one
eye
and
creating
enough
padding
to
keep
his
stetson
firmly
in
place
with
his
one
eye
and
one
nod
he
welcomed
the
company
two
towns
west
he
used
to
be
a
farmhand
one
town
west
he
was
a
road
merchant
here
he
sat
in
the
dark
it
was
warmer
inside
but
dryer
than
the
night
air
because
the
doors
and
window
shutters
were
always
closed
when
asked
if
it
was
to
keep
others
out
or
keep
him
in
he
grew
angry
and
thundered
incomprehensibly
rather
than
face
isolation
he
deliberately
calmed
and
feigned
interest
sparged
with
dry
humor
every
wrinkle
on
his
filthy
visage
was
an
evaporating
river
threatening
to
finally
reveal
the
countless
skeletons
of
every
drowning
he
was
perhaps
gregarious
as
an
expectation
but
never
a
preference
its
as
if
we
place
ourselves
amidst
anguish
and
tease
a
fury
ready
to
manifest
as
an
assault
on
what
is
expected
of
us
rather
than
what
we
want
facing
the
shelves
of
empty
bottles
he
rubbed
the
back
of
his
neck
hoping
to
wipe
away
perspiration
but
only
shook
off
flaking
skin
he
had
been
shedding
for
years
proprietors
and
squatters
know
the
tales
but
money
only
tells
one
story
the
buzzards
tell
the
rest
overall
this
is
only
the
second
5
rabbit
beer
ive
had
and
i
was
hesitant
if
trying
this
after
the
disappointing
golden
ale
i
had
i
was
more
pleased
with
this
brew
although
i
dont
think
this
is
great
but
its
decent
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
overall
nothing
i
would
buy
again
quite
a
strange
beer
i
was
kind
of
turned
off
by
the
fact
i
bought
a
chili
beer
but
roasted
chilies
is
quite
different
no
heat
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
complex
brew
that
is
both
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
as
it
is
widely
available
locally
its
a
beer
im
more
than
comfortable
falling
back
on
when
more
stellar
offerings
arent
available
o
this
was
my
first
chili
beer
and
i
hope
to
god
its
my
last
chili
beer
this
is
brutally
underrated
on
here
a
very
fine
chili
beer
one
of
the
more
drinkable
ones
out
there
and
with
a
remarkable
depth
and
complexity
in
front
of
the
pepper
not
behind
it
its
got
a
dark
amber
color
closer
to
brown
but
still
glowing
red
and
about
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
becomes
a
thin
film
in
a
few
warm
minutes
the
nose
on
this
is
way
out
honey
sweetness
from
the
red
malt
fire
roasted
long
chilies
and
semisweet
chocolate
as
well
as
a
slight
overdose
of
ale
yeast
which
is
abundant
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
at
the
first
sip
hard
to
tell
if
its
chili
hotness
or
burn
from
the
alcohol
the
pepper
gives
that
kind
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
ends
up
both
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
i
love
the
depth
here
vanilla
and
spice
maybe
cinnamon
like
something
from
the
age
of
exploration
this
goes
seemingly
beyond
the
ales
of
mexico
to
a
much
more
global
albeit
it
primitive
time
period
it
takes
me
there
and
i
like
that
quite
a
bit
of
body
but
plenty
drinkable
chili
feel
and
taste
but
not
too
much
heat
well
refined
and
far
better
than
its
scores
indicate
my
brother
was
right
about
this
one
and
i
now
am
in
search
of
other
beers
from
5
rabbit
this
is
a
clever
and
well
executed
concoction
that
said
this
was
an
interesting
maltforward
dark
ale
that
would
work
well
as
a
nightcap
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
dessert
id
try
this
one
again
now
that
the
brewery
itself
is
up
and
running
but
trust
not
the
minhas
contractbrewed
version
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
a
bit
of
peppers
taste
is
spicy
malty
good
pepper
flavor
without
to
much
heat
well
done
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
different
beer
i
wouldnt
want
a
steady
diet
of
but
worth
a
shot
not
something
id
seek
out
again
but
something
im
glad
i
tried
a
very
interesting
beer
overall
the
more
i
drink
the
warmer
my
belly
getsits
a
different
take
on
an
amber
ale
but
nothing
that
i
hope
catches
oni
definitely
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
as
my
gut
would
ulcer
i
thinkim
not
even
sure
im
gonna
finish
the
one
i
have
nowits
interesting
but
not
worth
your
precious
drinking

i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
dark
rich
reddish
almost
brown
color
body
with
a
nice
thick
foamy
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
bit
then
lays
down
to
a
nice
thin
lace
leaving
some
nice
stickyness
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
hint
of
ancho
chili
but
has
a
balsamic
vinegar
taste
to
it
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
vinegar
and
the
chili
flavor
comes
through
also
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
and
overall
thsi
is
a
ok
beer
ihave
had
better
just
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
then
drink
it
the
flavors
are
much
better
overall
drinkability
this
beer
gets
better
as
you
drink
it
and
as
it
warms
a
bit
this
beer
isnt
too
exciting
for
me
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
if
youre
a
brown
ale
fan
give
it
a
shot
i
still
appreciate
a
brewery
that
tries
different
things
amber
colored
with
a
thin
white
head
and
pretty
respectable
lacing
smell
is
a
sort
of
cocoacaramel
and
very
light
chile
the
taste
is
caramel
a
strong
sugar
some
peppery
clove
and
a
wonderful
slowsimmer
chile
which
never
overwhelms
but
never
really
goes
away
this
is
probably
the
best
chile
beer
ive
ever
had
do
well
implemented

not
overpowering
in
the
least

it

the

not
really
sure
why
this

has
a
lower
rating
i
thought
this
beer
was
tasty

a
dark

a
really
nice
aftertaste
from
the
chilis
it
is
brewed
with
provides
a
nice
little
bite
on
the
way
down
nothing
really
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
i
would
not
drink
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
but
overall
not
too
bad
o
while
this
isnt
a
great
beer
its
a
good
one
and
the
blend
of
a
dark
lager
and
some
restrained
chiles
just
seems
to
work
bought
this
to
pair
with
quesadillas
and
tacos
and
it
worked
just
fine
im
a
little
surprised
theres
not
more
body
considering
the
substance
of
the
head
this
beer
is
too
light
for
what
it
is
in
fact
its
downright
thin
there
needs
to
be
more
to
support
what
should
be
happening
theres
a
crisp
nip
and
no
liveliness
otherwise
it
should
be
smooth

isnt

slick

you
better

me
so
hard
with

this

i
love

is
unbearable
pretty

the
most
horrific

ive
come

in

simply
kills
the
beer
and
im
not
getting
any
heat
from
a
supposed
chili
beer
overall
staty
the
fuck
away
from
this
brewer
o
pretty
average
overall
but
not
terrible
the
main
problem
being
that
for
a
chile
beer
the
chilly
characteristics
of
this
beer
are
not
pronounced
enough
o
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
i
really
like
trying
chili
beers
and
this
is
another
chili
tick

beer

brewery
i
hadnt
heard
of
before
while
i
wasnt
hugely
impressed
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
just
a

boring

for
a
commercial

chile
beer
this
might
be
worth
it

otherwise
id
pass

in
much
of
the
same
though
the
caramel
comes
off
much
more
dull
and
the
chiles
are
greener
and
express
a
decent
though
still
pretty
small
amount
of
of
heat
things
dont
mesh
entirely
well
unfortunately
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
syrupy
feel
overall
not
my
choice
when
it
comes
to
chile
beers
but
its
not
all
bad
and
does
go
down
easily
enough
o
this
is
a
nice
blend
of
chiles
and
softer
malt
support
and
some
nice
english
yeast
esters
start
to
show
up
as
the
beer
warms
underneath
the
chiles
is
a
great
easy
drinking
brown
ale
that
has
lots
of
nice
depth
and
character
o
very
nice
i
actually
wouldve
preferred
some
more
heat
and
possibly
more
of
a
fire
roasted
pepper
flavor
to
compliment
the
caramel
and
chocolate
overall
though
quite
enjoyable
d
i
think
i
gave
up
on
the
last
few
ounces
as
the
heat
became
unpleasant
and
the
beer
didnt
taste
good
enough
to
warrant
consuming
more
under
those
conditions
theres
too
much
heat
and
not
enough
chili
flavor
you
could
probably
trick
someone
with
this
beer
actually
definitely
interesting
but
not
something
ill
be
rushing
to
try
again
any
time
soon
if
the
beer
matched
the
description
it
would
have
been
a
great
beer
but
i
felt
i
was
left
out
to
dry
all
in
all
not
bad
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
dnot
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
wish
the
chile
was
a
little
more
pronounced
in
this
beer
nothing
really
stood
out
while
drinking
this
one
caramel
malt
some
toastiness
fruity
yeast
and
peppery
spice
ancho
gives
it
a
nice
lingering
spicy
sweet
heat
in
the
aftertaste
subtle
and
nuanced
successfully
balanced
without
numbing
heat
which
can
be
rare
in
a
chile
beer
definitely
a
little
bit
smoky
pretty
malt
forward
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
paired
well
with
food
an
interesting
first
effort
from
this
fledgling
brewing
company
expectations
are
high
since
mr
mosher
is
involved
and
this
is
a
unique
beer
a
dark
ale
with
ancho
chiles
added
this
is
probably
the
best
chile
beer
ive
ever
had
i
do
hope
they
put
it
on
the
market
in
six
packsi
cook
a
lot
of
mexican
food
and
it
would
become
a
dinner
party
staple
for
me
d
an
excellent
chile
beer
a
very
distinctive
taste
that
does
not
have
overpowered
chili
presence
surprisingly
refreshing
after
about
10
minutes
it
began
to
leave
a
warm
tingling
sensation
on
my
throat
chili
residue
lager
with
a
jalepeno
burn
nice
change
of
pace
subtle
jalapeño
after
taste
makes
for
a
spicy
reprieve
from
your
usual
beer
medium
body
quite
spicy
mouth
feel
but
not
over
powering
pretty
amber
with
notes
of
honey
and
citrus
refreshing
looks
good
but
no
real
smell
flavor
is
mostly
spice
but
it
delivers
what
it
promises
a
little
too
smokey
flavored
not
much
jalapeño
flavor
i
think
they
did
a
fine
job
on
this
one
next
time
ill
try
another
variety
from
twisted
x
not
much
heat
or
flavor
from
the
jalapenos
and
the
base
pilsener
is
mediocre
too
taste
is
too
sweet
for
a
pilsner
and
a
bit
doughy
with
a
little
heat
and
flavor
from
the
jalapenos
in
the
finish
head
retention
is
good
but
the
carbonation
is
too
low
for
the
style
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
but
like
most
times
i
found
myself
underwhelmed
and
disapointed
by
a
chili
beer
c
thanks
austin
tx
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
surprisingly
good
like
a
somewhat
sweet
estery
hoppy
blond
ale
and
the
jalapeño
adds
burn
in
the
finish
is
good
but
gets
a
bit
too
intense
and
distracting
by
the
end
of
a
pint
but
id
definitely
have
one
in
a
nights
line
up
at
a
pub
final
grade
3
7
a
respectable
b
grade
this
can
of
red
rocket
coffee
spiced
stout
may
be
a
little
past
its
prime
but
i
am
still
liking
what
i
am
tasting
the
base
stout
is
not
particularly
interesting
inandof
itself
but
the
combination
of
cinnamon
and
cayenne
results
in
a
beautifully
spicy
blend
this
one
is
actually
hot
enough
that
i
could
see
it
being
a
turnoff
to
some
consumers
but
if
you
are
at
all
a
fan
of
chile
beer
this
neat
little
niche
brew
is
well
worth
the
risk
thumbs
up
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
one
in
the
future
very
interesting
i
enjoyed
it
and
the
cayenne
worked
but
i
would
like
it
toned
down
a
bit
with
more
coffee
stout
taste
this
beer
needs
to
be
renamed
with
cayenne
to
be
fair
to
consumers
overall
this
beer
has
chased
off
some
of
the
mouthful
of
pinecones
blues
ive
been
getting
with
a
lot
of
local
beers
from
lightly
hopped
lagers
to
the
double
ipas
it
seems
that
balance
isnt
in
the
ontario
brewers
vocabulary
at
the
moment
its
great
to
load
hops
into
ipas
and
dipas
but
imo
a
sessionable
beer
needs
a
bit
less
sometimes
just
enough
to
kiss
the
back
end
of
the
beer
and
there
needs
to
be
more
than
just
the
resiny
and
citrusy
hops
being
represented
in
local
beers
it
seems
but
i
digress
this
beer
is
darn
good
and
promises
a
unique
combination
at
least
as
has
been
available
to
me
that
has
certainly
left
me
satisfied
at
5
3
abv
id
say
its
pretty
sessionable
the
only
things
i
think
that
need
improvement
are
the
presence
of
cinnamon
and
vanilla
in
the
finished
product
it
doesnt
need
it
but
if
its
advertised
it
should
be
there
and
also
that
the
head
could
last
a
bit
longer
otherwise
and
all
things
considered
a
great
pint
enjoy
this
is
a
strange
brew
dark
with
a
dark
tan
head
the
scent
of
coffee
but
dark
chocolate
is
also
there
in
the
background
but
the
taste
the
chile
pepper
come
in
surprisingly
strong
not
a
chile
pepper
beer
fan
but
it
is
such
a
strange
blend
that
it
works
didnt
realize
it
was
a
chile
beer
when
i
bought
it
i
dont
enjoy
chile
beers
usually
but
this
is
the
most
drinkable
one
ive
tasted
id
be
lying
if
i
said
i
havent
tried
much
better
renditions
of
coffeechocolatechili
stouts
and
i
recall
earlier
draught
samples
of
red
rocket
being
far
more
explosive
still
ive
bought
numerous
cans
of
it
since
being
made
available
in
retail
and
though
nowhere
as
impressed
have
enjoyed
each
and
every
one
ill
bet
youll
do
the
same
provided
you
can
take
the
heat
overall
even
as
someone
who
loves
spicy
foods
and
spicy
beers
and
i
mean
ghost
pepper
hot
this
just
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
a
coffee
stout
laced
with
spice
and
brewed
with
cayenne
peppers
the
connection
between
the
two
just
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
so
while
its
something
im
glad
i
tried
i
probably
wont
be
repeating
this
purchase
overall
this
beer
was
a
great
stout
id
buy
this
again
for
sure
o
a
fantastic
brew
with
massive
flavours
and
a
potent
cayenne
pepper
heat
kick
the
mouthfeel
is
subpar
but
tolerable
such
a
fun
beer
on
tap
at
brothers
beer
bistro
near
black
with
a
light
mocha
head
aromas
of
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
creamy
mouthfeel
tastes
echo
the
aromas
but
with
the
addition
of
a
spicey
cayenne
pepper
finish
that
puts
a
beautiful
pleasant
tingle
in
the
back
of
the
throat
on
the
swallow
i
would
buy
bottles
of
this
if
it
hit
the
lcbo
tap
poured
a
black
color
stout
with
a
small
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
cinnamon
is
quite
pleasant
taste
is
at
first
a
mix
of
cinnamon
and
roasted
malt
with
light
bitterness
but
then
the
cayenne
notes
kicks
in
way
too
strongly
which
makes
the
aftertaste
really
hot
body
is
average
with
good
carbonation
the
cayenne
adds
an
interesting
edge
tot
his
beer
but
is
just
too
dominant
at
the
end
of
the
day
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
fair
bit
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
chile
cinnamon
beer
sawdust
city
is
22
on
this
trip
will
have
to
check
out
their
offerings
again
next
time
im
back
in
toronto
my
favourite
of
the
selection
at
cest
what
tap
takeover
the
cayenne

and
some
roast
draws
one
in

with
the

with

was
just
the
way
i
would
want
it
dark

very
good

smooth

excellent
spiced

but
needs
more
heat
cheers
delicious
take
on
a
xocovezamexican
cake
stout
made
me
think
of
a
dark
christmas
brew
poured
ontap
at
the
brewery
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
brown
to
black
coloring
with
a
light
foamy
cream
colored
head
nose
of
coffee
roast
bitter
bakers
chocolate
and
subtle
cream
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
coffee
with
a
subtle
cocoa
overlay
dry
light
body
with
a
coffee
bitter
aftertaste
dry
finish
very
nice
black
with
a
small
surface
covering
of
offwhite
foam
malty
aroma
that
features
smooth
wellintegrated
cinnamon
spice
and
coffee
roastnot
too
aggressive
with
either
flavor
follows
the
same
blueprint
a
nice
blend
of
chocolaty
malt
and
spices
leading
into
some
sweetened
coffee
and
a
hint
of
black
malt
char
right
at
the
finish
an
easy
drinking
version
of
the
increasingly
popular
mexican
chocolate
themed
stout
not
much
if
anything
from
the
peppers
so
spiciness
isnt
an
issue
nice
not
only
is
this
a
very
good
stout
its
an
exceptional
stout
given
the
abv
normally
i
dont
expect
a
flavor
and
body
from
a
stout
like
this
at
anything
under
8
but
this
is
under
6
very
impressive
accomplishment
overall
pretty
good
overall
this
beer
adds
up
to
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
beer
synergy
i
guess
very
happy
with
this
beer
as
part
of
the
charlotte
beer
offering
overall
this
isnt
bad
enjoyed
it
but
i
think
one
pint
a
night
is
enough
not
something
that
i
would
order
on
a
regular
basis
overall
a
very
good
and
unique
beer
lots
of
strong
flavors
i
wish
i
got
to
taste
it
fresher
though
definitely
worth
a
try
for
pepper
lovers
and
hop
lovers
i
am
not
drinking
this
as
i
write
i
had
it
last
night
and
today
wanted
to
just
add
a
small
note
about
it
i
live
in
chicago
and
for
the
last
month
i
have
been
buying
almost
exclusively
bombers
from
pipeworks
to
try
at
this
point
i
am
actively
trying
to
find
a
beer
from
them
i
dont
like
i
was
pretty
sure
this
would
be
it
and
it
isnt
this
beer
is
great
bizarre
but
great
just
the
intense
smell
of
peppers
and
heat
along
with
the
tropical
sweetness
makes
you
think
that
this
will
be
a
scorcher
but
somehow
it
isnt
you
do
get
all
the
flavor
of
the
hot
peppers
but
an
almost
complete
absence
of
heat
just
a
small
tickle
in
the
back
of
your
throat
and
it
blends
perfectly
with
the
tropical
fruit
both
from
the
hops
and
the
passionfruit
i
am
at
the
point
that
i
can
say
if
its
from
pipeworks
buy
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
heavy
amber
accents
capped
by
a
one
and
half
slightly
offwhite
head
above
average
retention
some
splotchy
lacing
chiles
passionfruit
and
mixed
citrus
on
the
nose

finishes
with

with

complemented
by
more
mixed
citrus
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
slick
and
somewhat
silky
with
hint
of

a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
the
chile
pepper
essence
and
signature
zing
is
there
but
little

o
ill
just
come
out
and
say
that
i
love
peppers
i
eat
them
in
every
which
way
hot
sweet
raw
cooked
pickledyou
name
it
i
cant
say
that
i
am
a
big
fan
of
how
they
work
with
beer
though
i
would
say
this
was
worth
trying
but
not
sure
id
pick
this
up
again
o
i
was
worried
with
the
smell
that
it
would
have
a
bite
of
heat
but
ended
up
being
really
nice
and
fruity
with
the
flavor
of
the
pepper
im
a
big
fan
of
heat
and
all
and
quite
sensitive
of
heat
but
love
the
flavor
of
peppers
which
i
got
in
this
beer
love
this
beer
overall
im
not
really
sure
what
to
make
of
this
brew
i
love
the
pepper
presence
but
was
surprised
by
the
lack
of
heat
on
the
flavor
after
the
peppers
there
isnt
much
here
is
this
a
pale
ale
with
peppers
added
or
a
chile
beer
either
way
it
is
very
tasty
but
is
off
balanced
strange
brew
indeed
i
love
all
the
components
of
this
beer
individually
like
the
concept
of
how
they
can
compliment
each
other
but
felt
it
was
a
competition
vs
collaboration
of
the
ingredients
fuck
it
this
beer
should
have
been
hit
with
a
dose
of
brett
lambicus
on
the
back
end
to
add
a
note
of
complexity
get
to
it
garrett
o
pipeworks
did
it
again
with
this
amazing
beer
it
has
so
many
flavors
going
on
but
yet
they
are
so
balanced
and
you
get
to
have
them
all
in
one
sip
too
many
times
you
buy
something
like
this
and
you
get
something
different
on
every
sip
but
never
all
in
one
overall
really
an
impressive
beer
the
kind
of
thing
where
i
would
go
back
to
the
store
and
by
10
bottles
so
i
can
just
have
a
store
of
it
because
who
knows
when
theyll
brew
it
again
if
you
like
wheat
beers
chiles
and
fruit
this
is
the
beer
you
have
been
waiting
for
although
pipeworks
is
known
for
powerful
pale
ales
and
stouts
im
a
wheat
beer
fan
and
this
is
as
good
as
anything
else
theyve
done
including
the
amazing
pineapple
bling
and
peppercorn
saison
way
more
flavorful
than
the
saizon
and
way
more
body
and
mouthfeel
than
the
pineapple
bling
overall
by
far
my
favorite
chile
beer
so
impressed
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
what
the
aviary
helped
them
do
i
assume
because
this
kind
of
thing
is
more
in
their
wheelhouse
with
the
chiles
makes
for
a
really
unique
and
enjoyable
experience
it
allows
for
the
chilies
to
dominant
the
aromatics
but
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
hops
in
the
taste
while
still
adding
complexity
to
the
mouthfeel
its
one
of
those
beers
that
is
almost
as
fun
to
sniff
as
it
is
to
drink
but
not
for
the
usual
reasons
it
seems
to
be
a
nod
to
the
aviarys
philosophy
of
creating
uniqueunexpected
sensory
experiences
with
their
drinks
i
think
they
do
this
here
in
a
nongimmicky
way
the
discripency
between
the
expectation
of
how
it
will
taste
on
the
tongue
based
on
the
aromatics
to
how
it
actually
tastes
is
momentarily
shockingin
the
best
possible
way
the
passionfruit
puree
is
well
integrated
and
combined
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
really
refreshing
drink
its
a
complex
and
well
executed
beermaybe
the
most
refined
thing
ive
seen
from
pipeworks
and
ive
always
been
a
fan
mouthfeel
is
good
moderate
carbonation
a
balances
the
big
body
and
bold
flavors
pours
a
jet
black
with
brown
head
and
quick

light
smoked
chipotle
roasty
malt
with
a
lingering
but
not
overwhelming
heat
that
lingers
to
the
palate
like
most
smoke
beers
its
best
to
pair
with
food
i
paired
this
with
carnitas
and
it
worked
perfectly

as
usual
not
for
everyone
if
you
are
sensitive
to
peppers
dont
bother
otherwise
dig
in
o
a
friend
warned
me
about
the
heat
that
this
beer
brings
but
i
got
next
to
nothing
in
terms
of
fiery
chile
out
of
it
though
in
my
experience
i
feel
these
chile
beers
tend
to
have
a
lot
of
bottle
variation
nonetheless
a
good
beer
just
not
the
one
i
was
expecting
d
solid
stuff
like
this
just
as
much
as
their
standard
smoked
porter
although
i
could
have
gone
for
even
more
chiles
and
burn
im
probably
in
the
minority
in
wanting
hotter
beers
but
the
label
promised
hot
and
i
was
a
bit
letdown
overall
really
highlights
the
chipotle
pepper
and
does
it
very
well
without
being
overwhelming
with
a
little
bitofadditional
chocolate
flavor
this
could
be
really
spectacular
m
medium
thought
it
would
be
thicker
its
a
fun
beer
the
pepper
brings
a
nice
little
heat
to
it
and
the
smoke
works
well
with
the
chocolate
o
everything
is
really
understated
which
is
nice
because
a
lot
of
smoked
beers
are
completely
over
the
top
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
chipotle
pepper
in
the
flavor
but
overall
this
was
a
nice
addition
to
the
smoked
porter
lineup
o
nice
porter
has
some
pepper
and
warming
but
i
wish
there
was
some
more
spice
im
still
steamed
at
my
local
chipotle
for
not
honoring
my
quesarito
order
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
cherrywood
smoke
chipotle
peppers
the
peppers
smoke
is
distinct
from
the
surrounding
cherry
mild
molasses
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
powder
everything
blends
together
so
well
and
the
smoke
is
so
easygoing
and
pleasant
that
i
honestly
dont
wanna
stop
sniffing
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
lighter
smoke
contingent
some
cinnamon
some
extra
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
hickory
wood
the
peppers
come
through
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
close
to
the
finish
but
they
dont
linger
very
long
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
damn
tasty
smoked
porter
one
that
doesnt
over
or
underdo
it
when
it
comes
to
both
the
smoke
and
the
peppers
though
the
peppers
come
awfully
close
to
underdone
get
some
pleasant
smooth
feel
with
lower
carb
levels
earthy
smoky
chipotles
linger
into
the
dry
aftertaste
plenty
of
chile
flavor
without
much
heat
really
end
of
days
is
spicier
some
dry
bakers
chocolate
notes
come
out
midpalate
and
a
slight
tingle
from
the
peppers
as
well
overall
a
great
variation
on
the
standard
smoked
porter
dont
be
scared
off
by
the
warning
on
the
label
that
its
spicy
big
pepper
on
the
smell
but
much
milder
in
taste
and
feel
while
still
maintaining
the
cream
ale
base
i
guess
people
who
drink
beer
typically
dont
like
spicy
food
judging
from
this
thread
i
however
really
liked
this
beer
it
is
spicy
the
jalapeno
is
definitely
there
i
am
glad
i
had
this
beer
with
food
the
mouthfeel
is
a
cream
ale
kind
of
that
frothy
silky
smooth
texture
the
aroma
is
that
of
vegetable
and
the
taste
as
i
have
noted
spicy
mixing
a
strong
spice
with
a
cream
ale
though
is
creative
and
the
latter
balances
it
out
a
good
style
to
mix
with
jalapenos
overall
i
would
not
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
but
it
is
something
i
am
very
happy
to
have
tried
it
is
creative
this
isnt
retired
at
all
its
on
right
now
at
wasatch
park
city
the
pour
is
like
a
standard
pale
ale
light
copper
in
color
with
an
inch
of
white
sturdy
head
the
nose
is
wow
fresh
jalapeno
peppers
some
of
them
may
be
roasted
slightly
but
the
vegetable
component
is
robust
in
the
nose
there
is
also
malty
forward
pale
and
crystal
malts
but
the
peppers
really
dominate
the
flavor
starts
off
wonderfully
peppery
and
hoppy
balanced
expertly
and
really
downright
delicious
but
then
it
starts
to
get
hot
then
hotter
then
hotter
yet
and
finally
your
whole
mouth
is
on
fire
the
heat
burns
the
throat
and
stays
with
you
for
far
too
long
i
like
the
pepper
flavor
and
think
its
balanced
well
by
the
other
ingredients
but
i
really
dont
care
for
all
this
heat
like
a
shot
of
hot
sauce
a
pint
would
be
a
challenge
for
me
the
fine
carbonation
and
creamy
medium
body
are
overwhelmed
by
the
heat
overall
a
cool
beer
to
try
especially
if
you
like
that
jalapeno
fire
but
hardly
a
session
beer
whew
beer
is
not
retired
as
i
just
had
one
at
the
wasatch
brew
pub
in
park
city
tonight
i
couldnt
resist
trying
as
it
sounded
so
different
i
had
wish
i
stayed
away
the
beers
appearance
is
as
good
as
it
gets
smell
is
just
of
the
jalapeño
taste
is
completely
dominated
by
jalapeño
again
for
me
it
was
to
the
point
that
i
could
barely
drink
the
beer
all
spice
and
heat
with
a
lot
of
pepper
taste
overall
this
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
i
could
barely
drink
it
and
only
finished
it
with
the
help
of
my
buddy
it
literally
made
my
stomach
upset
i
was
hoping
hoping
the
cream
ale
part
would
have
counterbalanced
the
jalapeño
to
make
a
balanced
beer
unfortunately
the
jalapeño
dominates
everything
interesting
jalapeno
isnt
my
favorite
flavor
and
as
such
i
find
most
beers
made
with
them
pretty
undrinkable
this
isnt
bad
though
overall
this
was
a
beer
you
need
to
enjoy
with
some
spicy
food
and
you
wouldnt
drink
much
of
it
at
one
time
a
different
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
name
this
is
a
subtle
but
very
welldone
beer
overall
doesnt
try
to
do
too
much
and
i
respect
that
very
drinkable
pepper
session
beer
spicy
smokey
taste
great
mouth
feel
big
smoke
flavor
big
pepper
flavor
only
small
heat
from
the
pepper
the
brew
pours
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
khaki
colored
head
that
holds
well
as
it
fades
it
leaves
spotty
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
for
the
most
part
contains
primarily
pepper
spice
that
tingles
the
nose
with
a
fair
amount
of
cocoa
in
the
background
the
taste
is
fruity
somewhat
yeast
driven
with
plenty
of
cocoa
and
peppery
citrus
burn
this
is
medium
bodied
and
modestly
carbonated
overall
i
think
the
base
beer
is
lacking
quite
a
bit
as
it
is
thin
and
lifeless
but
the
cocoa
and
oeoper
addition
was
well
executed
and
made
for
a
good
save
of
the
beer
this
is
definitely
a
porter
with
chilis
not
a
chile
beer
but
its
a
good
example
of
a
porter
enhanced
by
smoke
and
chilis
i
dont
think
it
will
blow
any
minds
but
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
overall
whispering
i
just
use
a
calculator
to
get
the
average
of
the
first
4
scores
and
adjust
based
on
emotion
4
00
a
nice
pepper
infused
porter
a
balance
everyone
should
chase
in
the
style
i
respect
it
but
i
dont
really
love
it
thats
my
take
on
this
smoked
chili
porter
all
kinds
of
woods
used
here
for
the
malt
and
the
pepper
is
intense
on
it
so
for
the
lover
of
a
little
heat
in
their
brew
this
is
for
you
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
an
oatmeal
looking
head
over
an
inch
tall
it
smells
heavily
smoked
with
the
pepper
coming
second
a
little
watery
perhaps
on
the
body
but
it
doesnt
hurt
it
much
in
my
eyes
i
get
a
lot
more
pepper
heat
than
i
need
here
its
not
dominant
but
its
real
strong
and
has
the
curious
property
of
mellowing
out
with
temperature
opposite
of
what
i
have
known
to
be
the
standard
the
smoke
is
the
best
part
its
complex
and
heavy
rachbier
style
woody
and
earthy
and
a
little
bitter
if
i
was
in
charge
of
this
beer
i
would
increase
the
grain
bill
a
little
darker
and
bitter
malt
and
id
scale
back
the
pepper
just
a
touch
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
would
like
this
a
lot
better
if
i
could
handle
the
heat
but
ive
never
cared
for
much
of
that
in
my
beer
impressive
offering
though
indeed
has
been
doing
some
very
unique
stuff
the
beer
is
9
0
abv
if
anyone
knows
how
to
update
that
everything
about
this
beer
is
perfect
its
an
excellent
example
of
every
style
of
beer
that
makes
it
up
porter
smoke
beer
pepper
beer
all
balanced
perfectly
together
and
this
year
i
dont
even
have
to
go
down
to
indeed
to
get
one
this
is
in
my
opinion
an
amazing
example
of
how
complex
a
beer
can
be
but
still
beautifully
simple
if
that
makes
any
sense
this
is
just
such
a
balanced
beer
and
perfect
to
pair
with
food
and
friends
in
the
ridiculously
long
frigidly
freezing
winter
weve
had
here
none
of
the
flavors
overwhelm
the
palate
or
over
take
the
others
so
pleasant
not
too
much
smoke
or
heat
id
say
the
smoke
a
high
low
and
the
heat
is
moderate
but
you
still
have
a
great
porter
as
a
base
i
think
indeed
should
start
canning
the
porter
without
the
smoke
and
peppers
as
a
year
round
beer
that
would
be
glorious
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
i
tried
and
forgot
to
rate
of
last
year
and
its
just
as
good
if
not
better
this
year
yum
maybe
one
of
the
more
radical
beers
to
be
packaged
in
minnesota
not
minnesota
nice
the
spice
and
smoke
is
going
to
alienate
a
lot
of
locals
but
it
is
an
excellently
crafted
and
composed
beer
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
while
the
heartburn
inducing
finish
is
a
little
bit
of
nuisance
it
doesnt
fully
detract
from
this
unique
offering
from
indeed
over
all
a
great
smoked
beer
the
heat
was
not
very
strong
but
works
well
with
the
sweet
chocolate
taste
it
follows
all
in
all
another
excellent
effort
from
indeed
overall
a
very
good
smoked
beer
good
smoked
dark
malt
taste
with
just
enough
pepper
to
add
a
nice
kick
without
becoming
too
hot
would
pair
well
with
mexican
food
overall
bold
beer
that
would
be
excellent
with
meat
and
stronger
cheese
enjoyable
in
meals
but
the
aftertaste
makes
it
harder
on
its
own
enjoyable
but
oils
not
drink
more
then
one
at
a
sitting
decent
beer
imperial
porter
with
smoked
chiles
collaboration
with
northbound
smokehouse
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
decent
mocha
head
smell
is
peppery
and
a
bit
chocolatey
taste
is
pretty
hot
with
a
good
chocolatey
background
lots
of
smoke
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
my
first
chili
beer
on
tap
at
the
brew
pub
you
can
definitely
taste
the
chills
and
feel
them
in
your
lips
i
liked
this
beer
dont
even
hesitate
because
its
a
pepper
beer
this
one
is
very
tasty
reviewed
from
my
notes
dated
1512
mouthfeel
all
pepper
thin
body
hardly
any
carbonation
completely
underwhelming
and
kind
of
gross
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
i
had
a
five
ounce
glass
of
this
which
was
plenty
golden
yellow
with
a
couple
bubbles
on
top
the
smell
was
really
good
all
peppers
reminded
me
of
sniffing
nachos
covered
in
jalapeños
the
taste
was
mostly
peppers
with
some
heat
to
it
i
thought
this
was
well
executed
for
a
chile
pepper
beer
but
i
still
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
a
whole
pint
of
this
ring
of
fire
burger
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
lingering
ring
of
white
foam
aromas
of
hatch
chilies
serranos
jalapenos
and
light
straw
palate
was
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
dry
warming
finish
flavors
of
hatch
chilies
jalapenos
and
serranos
with
a
smooth
dry
waming
lingering
chili
finish
d
if
you
like
a
chili
beer
youll
probably
like
this
i
found
it
to
be
a
nice
example
of
the
style
the
appearance
was
the
only
glaring
weakness
here
more
of
a
novelty
to
me
than
a
beer
id
order
again
i
really
like
this
but
i
can
definitely
understand
how
someone
could
hate
it
same
goes
with
taste
chile
is
dominant
but
not
overbearing
a
slight
hotspice
hits
at
the
end
but
calms
down
to
more
of
a
floral
finish
a
bit
sweet
at
first
before
the
chile
comes
out
still
a
bit
thin
but
i
think
thats
good
id
hate
to
have
a
thick
chile
coating
very
nice
d
actually
pretty
damn
good
i
thought
that
i
would
hate
it
and
its
not
something
that
i
would
really
buy
again
but
im
glad
that
i
gave
it
a
shot
this
is
actually
a
drinkable
chili
beer
had
with
lunch
at
the
brewpub
color
is
gold
with
almost
no
head
looks
like
a
normal
beer
until
you
get
close
enough
to
smell
it
the
aroma
is
completely
green
chili
very
inviting
if
you
are
as
big
of
a
fan
of
green
chili
as
i
am
taste
starts
out
with
just
a
bit
of
grain
and
then
the
green
chili
kicks
in
it
isnt
overly
hot
but
has
a
very
powerful
green
chili
flavor
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
is
definitely
more
chili
than
beer
also
seems
like
a
recipe
for
heartburn
if
you
drank
more
than
one
clear
yellowhay
hue
bright
white
head
of
a
finger
in
height
it
looks
very
much
like
a
pils
the
head
retention
was
very
good
surprisingly
so
and
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
webby
lacing
so
far
so
good
then
i
took
a
whiff
chili
pepper
heat
nothing
more
it
is
not
my
cup
of
beer
really
the
potency
was
strong
and
not
inviting
for
me
regardless
i
took
a
sip
chili
pepper
flavor
upfront
and
a
good
amount
of
heat
in
the
back
it
was
too
much
for
me
ive
had
two
other
beers
of
this
sort
one
was
restrained
and
good
jaipurs
jalapeño
ale
3
15
and
the
other
was
the
infamous
crazy
eds
cave
creek
chili
beer
1
00
not
so
good
sigdas
green
chili
is
some
where
in
the
middle
i
was
difficult
to
pinpoint
the
mouthfeel
it
was
around
mediumlight
with
moderate
carbonation
it
wasnt
watery
or
oily
that
is
a
plus
i
cant
say
it
was
very
drinkable
im
glad
i
sampled
it
just
to
get
a
better
grasp
on
this
style

i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anybody
but
a
chilihead
this
been
is
flavorful
with
just
enough
chili
zip
to
make
you
notice
to
me
it
was
like
an
ipa
but
instead
of
the
bitterness
of
hops
you
have
the
chilis
front
and
center
a
delicious
brew
flavor
this
is
where
you
need
to
have
some
enchiladas
to
pair
with
this
it
would
be
good
w
food
but
a
disaster
otherwise
this
is
a
nicely
done
chili
beer
i
liked
the
chili
flavor
but
its
not
something
you
can
drink
alone
imo
by
all
appearances
a
standard
pilsner
but
the
aroma
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
dominated
by
the
acrid
chili
taste
masking
any
sensation
that
this
might
actually
have
been
brewed
save
your
money
and
just
drink
the
juice
from
a
can
of
green
chilies
it
tastes
about
the
same
note
this
is
my
only
tasting
of
a
chili
beer
please
take
note
that
it
could
be
an
entire
dislike
for
the
style
rather
than
the
merits
of
this
style
of
beer
a
good
respectable
chili
beer
the
pepper
heat
starts
somewhat
slowly
then
builds
in
intensity
nice
combination
and
blending
of
pepper
heat
and
gentle
malt
flavors
pairs
nicely
with
their
bayou
chickensausage
pasta
dish
on
draft
at
the
source
the
beer
is
light
orange
and
mildly
hazy
with
a
thin
white
collar
the
aroma
does
indeed
offer
a
healthy
dose
of
green
chilies
the
flavor
is
one
dimensional
with
a
light
body
and
ample
green
chilies
throughout
no
heat
or
burn
in
the
finish
which
i
was
expecting
a
fun
beer
to
sample
and
well
done
for
what
it
is
i
like
green
chilies
so
its
likely
that
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
average
consumer
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
big
miss
i
would
not
could
not
drink
this
beer
again
d
good
for
what
it
is
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
it
is
not
offensive
in
any
way
ontap
at
the
brewpub
this
appears
clear
and
blonde
to
keep
this
simple
which
is
easy
for
this
brew
this
tastes
like
crisp
green
bell
peppers
in
a
glass
it
doesnt
taste
like
hot
peppers
like
other
chile
beers
just
greenhouse
bell
peppers
there
isnt
enough
malt
to
balance
out
the
pepper
and
the
pepper
isnt
terribly
tasty
its
worth
a
try
but
not
a
good
session
beer
lots
of
fun
growler
at
pprbsg09
this
was
actually
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
the
whole
gathering
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
salsa
and
tortilla
chips
flavor
is
largely
tortilla
chips
with
a
slightly
spicy
finish
not
really
spicy
at
all
and
im
very
sensitive
to
spices
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
like
tortillas
and
salsa
like
i
do
then
youll
enjoy
this
beer
so
drinkable
too
pours
a
clear
golden
color
5
inch
head
with
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
strongly
of
pepper
and
not
much
else
fits
the
style
of
a
chile
beer
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
noticeable
spiciness
high
carbonation
level
is
present
tastes
strongly
of
peppers
and
not
much
else
there
is
a
slightly
sweet
malt
background
but
thats
it
overall
it
is
noticeably
peppery
but
lacks
other
beer
subtleties
drinkability
i
guess
it
would
be
more
drinkable
if
paired
with
the
right
food
but
tha
maybe
this
beers
only
savior
d
i
like
flat
branch
and
most
of
their
beers
so
there
wont
be
a
chance
that
i
spend
my
money
on
this
beer
again
when
i
have
others
that
i
like
around
d
i
could
and
did
only
have
one
i
probably
wont
ever
have
another
one
but
it
was
worth
a
try
this
is
one
strange
brew
i
only
had
one
sip
and
thats
all
i
could
handle
i
guess
i
dont
like
peppers
in
my
beer
deep
amber
in
color
with
an
average
white
head
all
i
could
smell
are
peppers
in
the
aroma
strange
warm
spicy
peppery
flavors
they
are
light
but
really
noticable
yuch
thanks
sunkistxsudafed
for
the
opportunity
overall
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
its
not
amazing
wish
it
had
quite
a
bit
more
kick
to
it
but
still
a
solid
beer
if
you
arent
a
huge
fan
of
hot
food
this
might
be
a
good
example
of
a
milder
chile
beer
to
try
perhaps
if
i
have
multiple
in
one
sitting
the
hot
pepper
flavor
will
slowly
build
like
it
does
when
eating
spicy
food
over
the
course
of
a
meal
guess
ill
have
to
get
multiple
bottles
next
time
to
find
out
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
jubilation
fine
wines
in
albuquerque
o
gotta
give
it
a
try
it
is
not
too
hot
a
unique
beer
for
sure
i
would
definitely
drink
again
a
pretty
basic
and
faceless
chili
beer
underwhelming
is
my
assessment
but
i
gave
it
a
3
5
rating
for
taste
because
you
do
get
a
light
chili
presence
im
not
sure
but
it
strikes
me
as
being
a
lager
as
opposed
to
an
ale
that
might
explain
some
of
its
smooth
character
perhaps
a
good
starter
chili
beer
if
someone
is
new
to
the
style
and
is
afraid
of
too
much
heat
due
to
its
mild
nature
there
are
better
examples
out
there
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
didnt
see
if
there
was
a
freshness
date
on
it
this
pours
a
light
golden
or
a
straw
colored
beer
with
a
small
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
the
smell
is
with
an
obvious
green
chili
aroma
followed
by
a
crisp
lager
smell
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
you
get
a
nice
smooth
bit
of
green
chilies
not
hot
at
all
but
very
pronounced
interesting
but
i
really
wish
more
of
the
roasted
chile
character
was
here
and
in
general
this
could
use
a
whole
lot
more
chile
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
of
a
characterful
base
beer
either
though
this
wouldnt
be
nearly
as
noticeable
if
this
had
been
more
of
a
prominent
green
chile
gimmick
beer
said
another
way
the
current
base
beer
needs
a
whole
lot
more
green
chile
flavor
to
be
a
good
attempt
at
a
gimmick
beer
to
actually
be
a
good
beer
though
both
the
chile
flavor
needs
to
be
boosted
and
the
base
beer
needs
to
completely
change
to
something
with
a
whole
lot
more
character
even
a
porter
would
work
if
the
roasted
green
chile
was
done
properly
very
interesting
flavors
this
would
go
great
with
chips
and
salsa
i
am
a
fan
tastes
better
than
it
smells
medium
to
light
in
body
mildly
dry
finish
mild
pepper
on
the
back
and
some
mild
smoke
it
is
a
little
tough
to
drink
interesting
experience
but
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
the
ninth
entry
in
swillfest
2011
it
pours
a
clear
sallow
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
nothing
more
than
jalapeno
skin
and
seeds
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
greens
and
the
lightest
possible
touch
of
peppery
heat
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
kinda
sad
chile
beer
but
to
its
credit
it
doesnt
try
to
overpower
with
crappy
pepper
heat
which
definitely
makes
this
easier
to
drink
than
most
chile
beers
overall
ive
had
other
chile
beers
before
and
although
this
is
probably
the
best
that
ive
tasted
im
still
not
at
all
in
love
with
the
taste
still
kudos
to
them
for
it
not
being
horrible
either
started
out
with
promise
the
promise
of
chile
heat
but
delivers
far
too
little
in
the
end
sigh
i
really
have
no
idea
what
im
getting
into
with
this
beer
tomorrow
is
cinco
de
mayo
and
i
picked
up
what
i
initially
thought
would
be
your
basic
mexican
lager
cerveza
is
spansih
after
all
but
a
closer
inspection
of
the
label
informs
me
that
this
is
a
berr
with
green
chili
flavor
no
other
pertinent
information
is
available
which
means
no
abv
etc
let
me
just
say
that
ive
had
my
share
of
chili
beers
that
ive
liked
rogue
chipotle
weston
labs
2
flat
branch
green
chili
etc
but
more
often
than
not
theyre
revolting
cave
creek
chili
beer
lets
see
what
this
guy
has
to
say
pours
a
light
straw
thats
crystal
clear
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
dies
as
quickly
as
it
begins
so
far
so
good
it
looks
like
beer
first
aroma
is
stale
green
chili
and
not
much
else
first
taste
is
weird
theres
this
very
metallic
and
mineral
aftertaste
and
not
much
else
except
maybe
a
little
bit
of
chili
heat
nothing
overwhelming
at
the
end
second
taste
yields
a
bit
more
flavor
as
both
the
beer
character
and
the
green
chile
flavor
are
finessed
im
glad
this
thing
isnt
the
palate
destroyer
that
i
had
feared
when
first
opening
the
bottle
but
im
also
a
bit
disappointed
that
its
not
a
bit
more
substantial
this
beer
would
be
killer
with
some
nice
pork
tacos
or
other
spicy
mexican
food
on
its
own
its
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
pours
a
light
gold
with
no
head
to
speak
of
only
a
rim
aroma
is
like
a
freshly
opened
can
of
green
chile
the
taste
is
green
chile
dip
on
tortilla
chips
cool
this
is
a
absolutely
great
chile
beer
not
hot
at
all
but
with
big
green
chile
flavor
new
mexicans
like
me
who
love
green
chile
should
flock
to
this
im
going
to
have
to
try
this
with
all
sorts
of
new
mexican
foods
such
as
chile
rellenos
or
chicken
enchiladas
will
update
should
be
beautiful
omy
first
chile
style
cerveza
as
stated
in
another
review
this
is
a
superb
lunchtime
beer
which
is
exactly
when
i
drank
it
with
my
lunch
at
a
mexican
restaurant
not
bad
at
all
with
the
pop
of
the
cap
the
nose
is
invaded
by
an
even
greenchili
flavor
crystalclear
golden
color
and
fine
bubbles
keep
the
lacing
alive
fluffy
crispness
in
this
lighterbodied
beer
green
chili
flavor
is
very
prevalent
from
start
to
finish
very
even
while
still
letting
other
flavors
through
beery
flavors
ensue
with
fermented
grain
and
a
quick
kiss
of
hops
clean
dry
finish
with
a
very
mild
chili
warmth
it
screams
lunchtime
beerwhat
a
great
way
to
wake
up
the
palate
without
a
doubt
this
is
a
very
well
put
together
chili
beer
having
experienced
so
many
disgusting
attempts
at
chili
beer
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
its
definitely
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
wouldnt
turn
away
another
bottle
of
rio
grande
which
is
saying
a
lot
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
nice
carbonationnot
too
much
and
not
flat
pretty
smooth
considering
the
pepper
tastes
like
the
base
of
this
beer
is
a
pretty
bland
lager
there
is
a
light
graininess
from
the
malt
and
that
is
balanced
by
a
faint
hop
bitterness
the
chiles
are
great
not
overly
powerful
or
hot
but
the
roasted
flavor
has
the
faintest
reminder
of
cardboard
this
is
far
from
the
abomination
that
is
cave
creek
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
there
is
a
very
slight
heat
in
the
back
of
the
throat
but
nothing
dramatic
i
probably
will
like
this
beer
more
than
most
as
i
absolutely
love
green
chiles
in
beer
this
one
is
a
pretty
decent
attempt
i
like
it
p
s
if
a
green
chile
could
take
a
piss
this
is
what
would
be
in
the
toilet
the
smell
reminds
me
of
my
brothers
chili
ive
had
chili
beers
that
taste
like
peppers
but
this
one
actually
smells
and
tastes
exactly
like
chili
it
is
intriguing
but
the
novelty
wears
off
quick
and
you
realize
you
are
drinking
a
beer
that
tastes
like
chili
i
like
beer
and
i
like
chili
and
i
like
using
beer
to
make
my
chili
but
i
realize
i
dont
need
a
beer
that
tastes
like
chili
all
im
thinking
now
is
that
i
also
have
a
crazy
eds
cave
creek
chili
beer
in
my
fridge
as
well
i
can
only
imagine
how
bad
that
one
will
be
notes
so
much
for
the
beer
i
bought
aksp
in
seattle
after
this
he
doesnt
deserve
it
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
and
what
head
did
form
not
much
was
gone
in
a
flash
leaving
a
few
stray
bubbles
aroud
the
rim
of
the
surface
of
the
light
golden
brew
absolutely
no
lacing
aroma
is
dominated
by
green
peppers
which
one
would
expect
taste
is
dominated
by
the
pepperness
in
all
facets
but
some
pale
malt
sweetness
does
poke
its
nose
out
here
and
there
mouthfeel
is
limp
with
little
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
soso
not
one
for
pepperhaters
but
seemingly
not
as
bad
as
that
other
crazy
pepper
beer
scores
from
my
review
are
judged
to
style
not
to
superultimategreatestincrediblebeerintheworld
12
ounce
bottle
no
freshness
dating
purchased
for
3
06
per
six
pack
at
greens
in
atlanta
this
is
a
great
beer
for
adding
to
chillie
which
is
exactly
what
i
plan
to
do
with
most
of
the
rest
of
them
ok
this
was
for
me
an
oddly
dichotomous
beer
on
the
one
hand
i
could
tell
there
was
some
quality
here
the
actual
beer
underneath
the
chile
would
have
been
boring
not
much
body
or
flavor
but
the
chile
flavor
is
legit
and
actually
meshes
well
with
the
beer
still
something
about
it
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
and
i
couldnt
finish
it
being
from
arizona
where
everything
is
available
with
salsa
dry
and
a
pepper
like
twang

ale
and
a
chili
pepper
is
really
the
only
description
you
need
by
itself
the
taste
was
horrid
however
it
had
a
really
cool
look
with
the
clear
glass
and
the
light
colored
beer
with
a
chili
pepper
floating
in
the
bottom
used
the
second
bottle
in
a
beer
cheese
dip
recipe
that
was
great
this
one
has
to
go
as
one
of
the
top
novelty
beers
out
there
for
the
simple
fact
that
they
include
a
whole
serrano
chili
pepper
in
every
11
2
oz
bottle
coupled
with
a
clear
glass
bottle
and
the
transparent
yellow
liquid
the
highlight
of
the
show
is
on
full
display
i
split
this
with
a
friend
at
cafe
craft
in
north
charleston
sc
but
insisted
that
i
got
to
keep
the
pepper
rockpaperscissors
for
the
win
after
pouring
half
in
to
a
pint
glass
it
appears
a
little
cloudier
than
i
originally
thought
not
even
a
hint
of
any
foam
on
top
it
looks
like
an
extremely
cheap
macrolager
with
an
army
green
pepper
ominously
floating
in
the
depths
canned
green
beans
spicy
pepper
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
what
i
expected
a
watery
adjunct
with
a
slight
corn
flavor
and
pronounced
pepper
heat
the
pepper
starts
out
fairly
strong
and
builds
on
your
palate
to
create
a
burning
sensation
in
fact
the
spiciness
elicited
a
few
sneezes
in
quick
succession
then
left
a
pleasant
burn
in
my
mouth
and
throat
this
is
as
advertised
mexican
corn
swill
with
a
fantastic
pepper
punch
i
just
wish
i
would
have
let
my
friend
eat
the
serrano
pepper
do
yourself
a
favor
and
do
not
eat
that
i
cant
even
describe
the
taste
it
gives
no
appreciable
added
heat
and
fills
your
mouth
with
a
disgusting
flavor
overall
this
one
is
great
if
you
like
palate
scorchers
i
can
appreciate
this
after
sampling
many
purported
pepper
beers
that
give
little
to
no
spicy
heat
i
may
be
in
the
minority
on
this
one
but
id
happily
have
it
again
a
respectable
chili
beer
that
lacks
looks
yet
does
a
great
job
of
presenting
the
heat
fair
enough
for
the
style
proving
once
again
that
i
will
try
anything
once
i
popped
the
cap
and
began
the
pour
albeit
more
gently
than
usual
as
i
wanted
to
decant
the
chili
pepper
added
i
also
queued
up
rhcp
grateful
deads
friend
of
the
devil
and
the
rollings
stones
sympathy
for
the
devil
on
youtube
as
musical
accompaniment
between
my
gentle
pour
and
the
beers
inherent
carbonation
it
was
as
fizzy
as
soda
pop
and
quickly
fell
to
wisps
nose
was
astounding
in
the
sense
that
i
was
taken
aback
by
its
heat
this
was
not
going
to
be
like
the
previous
tommyknocker
chile
beer
and
no
one
was
going
to
have
any
sympathy
for
me

2

taste
is
awful
pure

a

aftertaste
spiciness
is
overpowering
rendering
this
beer
undrinkable
feels
light
and
hot
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
beer
would
is
on
the
list
of
worst
10
beers
i
ever
drank
o
this
beer
is
all
about
the
chili
theres
no
balance
and
all
you
get
is
peppers
but
maybe
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
for
the
style
if
all
you
want
is
peppers
if
you
are
looking
for
balance
you
need
to
pair
this
one
with
some
nachos
and
guacamole
picked
up
a
bottle
because
the
store
i
stopped
by
was
selling
them
as
singles
figured
should
be
interesting
anyway
and
that
is
about
the
most
i
can
say
not
a
great
beer
but
certainly
not
bad
a
nice
light
beer
the
pepper
is
an
interesting
twist
if
you
like
spice
it
might
work
for
you
but
not
much
more
than
a
interesting
try
dont
get
burned
by
this
devil
keep
looking
i
picked
this
beer
up
in
a
rushed
frenzy
with
a
handful
of
other
chili
beers
not
knowing
this
actually
had
a
pepper
in
the
bottle
until
i
took
it
home
was
initially
disappointed
but
after
giving
this
beer
a
try
i
can
actually
say
it
wasnt
bad
i
actually
enjoyed
it
it
was
interesting
and
rather
refreshing
i
generally
dont
give
a
good
note
to
such
beer
but
in
that
case
if
you
understand
what
this
beer
is
all
about
youll
probably
change
your
mind
many
people
see
this
beer
as
a
serious
beer
which
is
supposed
to
taste
like
beer
its
quite
the
opposite
its
pretty
much
the
beer
you
challenge
someone
to
drink
because
its
so
spicy
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
drink
a
bottle
of
tabasco
but
as
a
beer
now
try
this
beer
again
its
really
perfect
in
this
context
otherwise
dont
drink
it
also
once
again
i
ate
the
pepper
why
do
i
do
this
to
myself
this
pepper
actually
still
had
some
heat
left
to
it
a
lot
was
gone
and
replaced
with
a
huge
earthy
note
do
not
eat
the
pepper
trust
me
final
thoughts
avoid
this
beer
all
the
reviews
say
it
and
its
true
i
dont
even
know
why
they
still
sell
this
one
but
one
things
for
sure
im
never
buying
this
one
again
man
this
is
terrible
kudos
for
doing
it
but
they
couldve
made
it
drinkable
overall
have
a
good
dose
of
courage
to
finish
this
beer
if
youre
a
kind
of
drinker
that
likes
to
experiment
then
go
for
it
otherwise
avoid
bottle
from
hogtownharry
thanks
harry
this
one
is
a
deep
gold
beer
with
a
fizzy
tiny
bubbled
head
with
decent
length
smells
of
a
jelapeo
peppers
cayenne
even
with
some
malts
shit
this
is
spicy
harry
what
are
you
trying
to
do
to
me
undrinlably
spicy
and
prppery
flavours
mixed
in
with
corn
water
finishes
poorly
spicing
up
my
mouth
i
sipped
this
for
an
hour
and
still
had
34
of
a
bottle
left
then
two
other
people
tried
it
and
there
was
still
half
a
bottle
left
argh
d
well
it
is
what
it
is
if
you
happen
to
like
mixing
pepper
and
bland
beer
this
is
your
ticket
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
nor
would
i
want
to
the
morning
after
would
be
hell
drinkability
im
not
sure
i
will
get
through
one
d
no
interest
we
were
5
on
the
same
bottle
and
we
didnt
finished
it
d
none
i
had
to
throw
it
out
after
a
few
sips
i
was
getting
indigestion
poured
out
an
orangey
gold
color
with
no
head
whatsoever
looks
like
decent
carbonation
though
the
nose
was
like
pure
pepper
juice
or
pepper
oil
every
time
i
go
in
for
a
whiff
i
scream
like
a
little
girl
i
split
a
bottle
with
a
friend
were
having
a
hard
time
getting
past
the
nose
neither
of
us
wants
to
dirnk
it
its
become
a
double
dog
dare
damn
ok
here
i
go
the
first
words
out
of
my
mouth
were
wow
this
is
some
horrendous
horseshit
i
cant
ever
fully
describe
this
beer
i
had
half
a
sip
and
almost
induced
vommiting
this
is
punishment
beer
make
people
pay
for
their
mistakes
by
drinking
this
someone
sleeps
with
your
sister
make
them
drink
this
bottle
poured
an
orangeyyellowish
ale
with
absolutely
no
carbonation
aroma
of
hot
jalapeno
is
completely
dominant
taste
is
way
too
hot
for
my
taste
bud
with
what
can
only
be
describe
as
liquid
hot
jalapenos
complete
drain
pour
and
again
i
see
no
point
in
drinking
this
again
i
had
a
very
hard
time
finishing
this
beer
it
really
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
going
for
it
i
even
tasted
the
brownish
chile
pepper
floating
in
it
and
it
was
slimy
and
nauseating
definitely
a
novelty
beer
not
recommended
actually
i
dont
think
it
could
be
much
worse
came
back
several
times
for
this
one
got
a
growler
and
2
bottles
to
go
as
well
its
addictive
and
refreshing
not
too
spicy
its
more
infused
with
bright
chile
flavor
than
anything
with
a
nice
malty
hoppy
base
probably
one
of
the
finest
chili
beers
ive
ever
had
i
dont
know
how
eskes
gets
the
lingering
head
nearly
every
chili
beer
ive
encountered
has
virtually
no
head
after
the
initial
pour
but
this
beer
would
be
notable
if
only
for
this
characteristic
but
the
overall
chili
beer
character
is
there
bold
and
proud
a
very
very
delicious
example
of
the
style
with
the
added
bonus
of
an
exceptional
appearance
actually
better
than
the
tap
version
i
had
the
other
month
giving
this
a
high
overall
score
because
i
found
it
very
satisfying
likely
a
pilsner
but
as
previously
noted
perhaps
a
touch
of
wheat
chilis
obvious
on
the
nosethis
was
very
strong
chili
flavor
was
surprisingly
restrained
i
didnt
drink
more
than
a
sampler
size
but
was
really
glad
i
tried
it
perhaps
the
best
chili
beer
i
have
had
its
pretty
good
worth
it
even
if
you
dont
love
chili
and
pretty
drinkable
would
go
well
with
milder
texmex
food
cheese
beans
etc
you
have
to
order
a
glass
of
this
at
this
brewpub
as
it
is
their
signature
beer
now
this
style
is
one
that
has
been
ruined
by
eds
crazy
creek
and
chances
are
most
people
have
only
had
the
rogue
chipotle
as
a
good
example
this
is
a
pretty
good
chile
beer
using
a
lightish
pale
ale
base
with
new
mexico
green
chiles
the
beer
is
not
too
hot
but
once
you
get
a
quarter
way
down
the
glass
you
feel
a
slight
burn
drink
with
a
mexican
style
entree
from
their
kitchen
and
the
beer
works
well
and
seems
less
hot
couldnt
really
drink
more
than
a
glass
of
this
beer
but
i
did
enjoy
that
glass
all
in
all
id
say
this
is
mostly
a
novelty
i
wouldnt
go
far
afield
to
sample
this
brew
but
i
would
gladly
quaff
another
if
offered
the
chance
especially
if
i
was
about
to
enjoy
some
hearty
fare
mexican
food
may
seem
an
obvious
choice
but
id
prefer
something
a
bit
less
zesty
to
compliment
the
assertiveness
of
this
ale
had
this
on
tap
at
eskes
it
was
a
nice
golden
color
with
not
much
head
it
had
a
peppery
and
hops
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
malts
the
flavor
was
really
good
just
enough
pepper
to
know
it
was
there
but
mainly
a
pale
ale
flavor
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
it
had
a
light
body
with
a
nice
crispness
to
it
pretty
drinkable
and
one
that
i
could
order
if
i
go
back
done
of
the
best
all
around
chili
beers
i
have
had
and
unique
in
that
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
light
beer
this
one
is
actually
drinkable
in
multiple
pints
most
chili
beers
i
have
had
use
a
darker
malt
base
like
rogue
chipotle
very
nicely
done
and
went
very
well
with
our
nuevo
mexican
food
if
you
have
had
eds
cave
creek
chili
and
now
shy
away
from
chili
beers
break
your
boycott
and
give
this
one
a
try
not
a
great
fan
of
anything
hot
but
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
unusual
beer
style
well
in
the
uk
anyway
a
challenging
golden
coloured
pale
ale
with
a
strong
taste
of
green
peppers
great
if
you
like
this
type
of
beer
suggest
you
drink
it
midway
through
a
session
and
wash
it
down
with
the
seco
stout
abv
4
5
and
yes
i
realize
this
style
just
isnt
for
everyone
but
if
you
got
burned
by
a
wretched
cave
creek
give
this
one
a
try
ipa
1st
with
a
great
pepper
after
taste
not
spicy
very
good
copper
orange
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
aromas
of
citrus
and
hops
spicy
peppers
emerge
more
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
jalapeño
blends
nicely
into
the
flavor
profile
rather
than
overpower
an
interesting
beer
fun
to
try
best
in
small
quantities
was
not
really
impressed
with
this
beer
had
higher
hopes
as
i
have
liked
some
of
their
other
beers
the
color
was
nice
there
was
no
real
smell
that
i
would
expect
with
a
pepper
beer
was
not
able
to
pull
any
of
the
pepper
taste
from
the
beer
as
for
the
ipa
beer
itself
i
would
consider
it
just
average
overall
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
twist
on
the
double
ipa
style
the
base
brew
is
a
nice
recipe
and
the
jalapeno
infusion
is
done
well
overall
this
was
my
first
chile
beer
to
review
and
it
wont
be
my
last
i
am
looking
forward
to
abc
putting
this
out
again
overall
this
is
quite
drinkable
though
it
would
be
much
better
with
less
sugary
taste
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
qfc
market
in
the
seattle
university
shopping
center
pours
with
a
proper
tan
head
color
is
amber
with
hues
or
orange
at
the
edges
aroma
consists
of
subdued
citrus
hops
and
surprisingly
aromatic
jalapeno
notes
the
jalapeno
seems
to
overpower
on
the
tongue
a
bit
at
first
but
some
citrusy
hops
and
sweet
malt
ride
in
to
save
the
day
medium
bodied
and
mostly
smooth
i
must
admit
for
reasons
of
transparency
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
jalapenos
but
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
go
to
see
how
it
worked
despite
my
aversion
to
aforementioned
pepper
i
thought
the
beer
was
wellcrafted
and
well
balanced
with
no
signs
of
contrivance
overall
me
thinks
its
a
good
brew
that
could
have
been
close
to
awesome
if
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
sorry
to
harp
on
that
if
you
love
the
flavor
of
fresh
jalapeno
you
should
love
this
beer
would
be
great
as
a
cooking
beer
with
all
the
great
flavors
it
has
overall
nothing
overpowering
in
the
spice
category
but
a
nice
little
kick
the
jalepenos
really
stand
out
here
and
make
it
so
it
is
tough
to
find
other
flavors
o
this
is
a
solid
effort
to
make
a
jalapeno
beer
it
looks
like
a
beer
and
tastes
like
a
beer
i
would
prefer
more
hoppiness
in
the
taste
with
a
little
more
subtle
jalapeno
flavoring
this
is
a
good
beer
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
bronze
amber
with
a
fine
one
finger
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
mild
aroma
of
neutral
malt
light
grassy
hops
and
a
hint
of
hot
pepper
that
is
more
soapy
than
tingling
flavor
of
bready
malt
light
citrus
light
stone
fruit
with
building
hop
bitterness
and
hot
pepper
finishes
with
a
lingering
mild
but
distinctive
jalapeno
pepper
flavor
and
light
burn
medium
bodied
a
mild
mannered
chile
beer
with
a
malt
body
that
is
closest
to
an
amber
with
interesting
but
not
distinctive
chile
pepper
esters
and
a
mild
hotness
surprising
lack
of
hop
flavor
although
there
is
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
kind
of
misses
the
mark
for
an
imperial
ipa
but
satisfactory
for
a
light
chile
beer
pleasant
but
not
memorable
its
not
a
good
thing
when
appearance
gets
the
highest
score
of
all
the
categories
this
beer
is
pretty
average
well
made
i
suppose
but
it
just
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
hop
department
and
they
are
calling
this
an
imperial
ipa
i
dont
expect
to
drop
bomber
price
cash
on
this
again
i
dont
even
know
that
i
would
recommend
trying
it
once
i
have
to
its
my
closest
regional
brewery
i
had
heard
it
was
pretty
good

the
smell
is
what
you
would
expect

mixed
with

and
a

the
taste
was
solid

not

is
just
a

in

that

stringy
lacing

of

the

and
there
as
well
the
finish
is
bitter
with
a
slight
pepper
aftertaste
i
am
honestly
a
little
gunshy
with
chili
beers
as
anyone
who
has
ever
tried
cave
creek
will
attest
still
yellow
with
a
nice
pepper
smell
taste
is
very
jalapenochili
with
little
beer
flavor
heat
does
not
linger
very
long
it
is
hot
not
as
hot
as
stone
crime
or
punishment
though
overall
an
ok
hot
beer
cloudy
yellow
slightly
orangey
brownish
tinge
smells
like
spicy
olive
juice
taste
is
very
peppery
spicy
hot
not
an
understatement
cant
believe
how
hot
this
stuff
is
starts
in
the
beginning
of
the
mouth
and
works
your
way
to
the
back
of
the
throat
good
for
a
hot
beer
but
nothing
youd
drink
on
a
regular
basis
makes
a
great
chili
base
man
up
or
go
home
this
is
exactly
as
advertised
looks
like
a
nice
guy
semi
cloudy
wheat
smells
like
a
pleasant
chili
pepper
before
you
bite
it
taste
be
ready
its
not
a
fake
beer
love
it
not
a
daily
drinker
like
rogue
chipotle
ale
it
is
honest
real
spicy
fun
enjoy
once
every
month
or
so
o
its
just
too
much
not
bad
but
not
recommended
the
heat
hasnt
been
intolerable
for
me
but
maybe
thats
because
there
is
no
regulating
a
pepper
some
are
hot
and
some
are
not
i
guess
i
just
got
a
cool
one
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
chile
pepper
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slightly
sour
chile
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
chile
heat
in
the
back
of
the
throat
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
pretty
nice
chile
flavor
edit
i
couldnt
finish
the
bomber
the
heat
was
too
much
not
my
style
or
preference
will
kill
any
other
beer
and
most
foods
dont
even
try
to
taste
other
styles
after
this
one
it
is
a
real
palate
wrecker
if
you
just
want
a
hot
spicy
drink
for
some
reason
this
is
for
you
but
this
one
is
a
one
dimensional
novelty
that
has
been
handled
with
much
to
much
of
a
heavy
spicy
pepper
hand
just
my
opinion
the
heat
and
burn
in
my
mouth
and
throat
has
not
diminished
in
over
ten
minutes
o
i
didnt
like
this
beer
it
had
a
muddy
wheat
flavor
followed
by
a
bilelike
burning
spiciness
that
coated
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
i
wont
be
partaking
in
this
beer
again
overall
a
good
chili
beer
lots
of
heat
but
the
underlying
nuances
peak
thru
drinkability
is
good
if
you
like
chili
beers
brewery
claims
it
won
silver
at
2004
gabf
possibly
in
the
juvenile
beer
joke
catagory
give
your
buddy
a
gulp
of
this
stuff
right
after
you
spring
the
whoopee
cushion
on
him
i
have
to
compare
this
to
ghost
face
killah
for
its
total
commitment
to
bottled
silliness
this
is
definitely
not
for
everyone
but
it
is
for
me
i
like
chili
beers
and
this
one
delivers
very
well
done
for
the
style
i
will
be
revisiting
this
one
o
this
isnt
bad
for
a
chile
beer
the
aroma
is
very
good
in
my
opinion
but
the
other
aspects
are
certainly
lacking
it
does
pair
well
with
my
turkey
and
jalapeno
sandwich
though
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
was
let
down
i
actually
didnt
even
get
through
a
quarter
of
the
bomber
i
bought
if
this
pepper
taste
could
maybe
be
infused
with
a
stout
or
porter
style
that
had
more
depth
in
the
beer
i
could
really
see
it
working
out
better
well
my
search
goes
on
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
a
spicy
hot
chili
beer
that
burns
your
mouth
than
this
is
it
very
fun
beer
to
use
as
a
novelty
but
i
could
not
enjoy
more
than
a
few
sips
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
lot
better
if
it
was
blended
down
with
more
of
its
base
wheat
ale
o
wow
hot
sauce
in
a
beer
i
love
hot
stuff
and
i
love
beer
but
i
do
not
love
this
not
my
type
of
beer
beer
is
usually
refreshing
and
something
i
love
to
drink
after
i
eat
spicy
food
no
relief
here
overall
this
isnt
much
it
is
just
hot
not
something
i
would
buy
again
there
are
hotter
and
more
flavorful
chilie
beers
out
there
this
is
closer
to
the
bottom
of
the
pack
than
the
middle
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
there
are
excellent
variations
of
chilis
with
a
good
spiciness
it
could
use
a
little
malt
body
and
touch
of
sweetness
but
i
think
its
just
meant
to
be
about
the
chilis
i
recommend
this
is
you
like
chilis
and
spice
overall
i
actually
think
this
is
a
good
chile
beer
not
a
lot
of
balance
going
on
so
that
kind
of
kills
the
score
but
over
all
not
a
bad
little
beer
o
a
chile
beer
should
have
elements
of
chile
and
beer
to
it
this
only
has
elements
of
chiles
i
think
if
there
was
some
balance
to
the
beer
its
a
style
that
could
work
well
as
is
its
hard
to
drink
o
disappointed
this
is
like
drinking
jalapeno
juice
and
there
is
only
one
flavor
i
think
there
needs
to
be
a
significant
amount
fine
tuning
to
add
and
make
it
more
palatable
i
mean
in
less
you
love
the
heat
get
out
of
the
kitchen
looking
forward
to
washing
this
one
down
with
a
stout
yes
this
beer
tastes
like
chilis
and
its
hot
this
should
come
as
no
surprise
since
theres
a
big
red
chili
on
the
bottle
along
with
the
words
spicy
and
hot
this
pairing
is
excellent
chilis
are
not
just
heat
they
have
fruit
flavors
as
well
the
fruitiness
of
the
chilis
is
a
natural
match
for
the
floral
wheat
ale
the
the
heat
is
a
welcome
note
most
fruit
beers
are
cloying
crap
for
people
who
dont
actually
like
beer
this
isnt
the
first
drink
is
a
surprise
and
not
necessarily
a
pleasant
one
but
wait
a
moment
let
the
endorphins
hit
and
then
form
an
opinion
nice
work
6
rivers
overall
im
surprised
by
the
low
scores
of
this
beer
what
else
would
one
expect
from
a
chili
beer
a
nice
beer
for
the
style
and
also
one
of
the
spicier
ones
ive
had
the
beginning
isnt
horrible
but
your
relief
only
lasts
for
one
second
it
feels
like
someone
stuck
their
hand
down
your
throat
and
pulled
on
your
tonsils
with
a
chili
pepper
glove
the
finish
is
so
dry
leaving
you
with
this
mouth
of
residue
and
horribleness
that
left
me
coughing
seriuosly
never
again
oh
cruel
cruel
world
why
does
this
exist
pours
a
bright
hazy
dark
straw
color
very
thin
head
that
nearlyimmediately
dissipates
thin
white
collar
kill
shot
for
sure
the
nose
is
a
mess
of
bell
peppers
and
jalapenos
amyliz4
says
it
smells
like
tater
tots
who
can
argue
its
bad
damnit
this
better
be
a
chili
beer
loads
of
spicy
jalapeno
and
green
pepper
skin
thin
body
and
moderate
carbonation
really
disgusting
awful
horrible
disgusting
unbearable
nearly
everyone
consuming
this
almost
vomited
f
i
like
spicy
things
i
like
peppers
i
like
beer
this
is
not
a
graceful
creation
combining
the
good
of
any
of
these
things
if
you
seek
the
novelty
of
this
strain
some
rancid
salsa
and
splash
some
mgd64
in
for
a
beer
presence
blargh
p
s
i
dont
like
hot
foods
with
my
beer
because
it
tarnishes
my
palate
but
what
happens
if
my
beer
tarnishes
my
palate
if
you
would
to
ask
me
for
another
six
rivers
chili
pepper
ale
i
would
say
no
thank
you
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
very
good
it
has
a
great
pepper
smell
and
flavor
to
it
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
this
was
very
very
good
i
love
spice
so
i
would
love
this
beer
i
understand
not
everyone
loves
the
burn
of
peppers
when
drinking
a
beverage
but
i
am
one
of
those
people
i
guess
it
is
different
very
different
but
this
is
one
that
deserves
a
try
i
have
friends
who
think
they
are
big
bad
manly
men
and
they
drink
keystone
light
like
it
shows
how
manly
they
are
they
would
cry
there
little
eyes
drinking
this
beer
now
this
right
here
is
a
real
mans
beer
this
is
a
bit
of
a
shock
to
the
senses
looks
like
a
normal
yellow
beer
until
you
put
it
under
your
nose
then
there
is
no
question
this
is
a
pepper
beer
mouthfeel
is
actually
quite
decent
however
and
pepper
is
what
this
tastes
like
you
are
not
even
sure
it
is
beer
remarkable
for
its
type
however
and
while
it
is
a
bit
of
a
novelty
it
is
actually
decent
to
drink
brew
pours
a
hazy
ice
tea
in
color
with
a
good
2finger
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
quickly
to
nothing
at
all
some
minor
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
but
really
not
much
to
mention
even
the
aroma
is
actually
very
light
of
the
jalapeño
peppers
and
not
much
else
boy
when
you
take
a
sip
it
is
really
there
lol
warms
your
throat
down
to
your
stomach
all
the
way
down
even
got
the
top
of
my
head
a
little
sweaty
actually
isnt
that
bad
as
the
burn
doesnt
last
long
lighter
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
when
i
opened
the
bottle
it
just
kept
coming
out
overall
it
was
ok
if
you
like
this
style
of
brew
would
pair
well
with
some
mexican
or
other
similar
food
or
a
plate
of
loaded
nachos
overall
it
was
ok
if
you
like
this
style
of
brew
wow
really
enjoying
the
jalapeño
i
dont
review
many
beers
but
i
usually
look
them
up
before
dropping
money
on
them
this
beer
needs
a
good
hard
sniff
to
get
any
jalapeño
smell
color
is
hazy
no
lacing
no
carbonation
the
taste
is
what
hit
me
a
definite
bite
and
doesnt
leave
a
hoppy
aftertaste
i
think
its
great
paired
with
spicey
casual
foods
love
this
beet
heavy
on
the
jala
pinos
with
a
spicy
kick
we
use
it
to
chase
tequila
as
advertised
label
is
exactly
what
it
taste
like
if
you
like
spicy
hot
food
this
is
the
beer
to
try
out
as
well
if
anything
the
jalapeno
should
accelerate
the
alcohol
to
sweat
out
of
your
skin
faster
to
drink
more
lol
after
pouring
you
can
immediately
smell
the
jalapeno
within
the
beer
its
like
drinking
beer
and
eating
jalapeno
bread
and
the
aftertaste
gives
you
a
natural
beer
effect
which
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
it
would
be
an
interesting
beer
to
cook
with
as
well
perhaps
brats
if
you
love
spicy
food
youll
probably
enjoy
this
beer
but
the
peppers
here
overwhelm
any
sense
of
flavor
the
beer
has
its
like
a
sip
of
light
beer
with
a
spoonful
of
hot
salsa
at
the
same
time
my
bottle
was
icecold
yet
the
spicy
taste
almost
made
it
seem
like
it
had
been
sitting
in
a
hot
car
all
afternoon
a
unique
beer
experience
just
not
one
i
care
to
repeat
anytime
soon
on
a
side
note
bent
river
brewery
does
have
very
good
food
and
beer
on
the
menu
if
youre
in
the
quad
cities
area
along
the
iail
border
its
well
worth
checking
out
this
is
quite
nice
i
really
enjoy
the
pleasant
medium
heat
to
this
one
it
balances
the
malt
well
too
the
rio
grande
pancho
chile
is
still
my
favorite
chile
brew
but
this
one
is
a
close
second
and
beats
it
in
the
use
of
heat
no
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
but
if
you
are
into
heat
or
peppers
and
want
something
new
this
is
a
winner
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
a
friend
unless
i
was
trying
to
prank
them
not
a
beer
that
your
gonna
pound
all
afternoon
but
defiantly
one
to
enjoy
with
some
mexican
food
or
a
really
good
burger
by
the
way
if
you
stop
at
bent
river
the
food
is
great
similar
flavors
floral
and
earthy
pepper
with
a
hint
of
spice
some
bready
malt
and
tea
leaf
notes
in
the
middle
leaving
a
slight
tingle
of
heat
in
the
back
of
the
palate
after
a
few
sips
overall
very
drinkable
i
felt
the
craving
for
another
glass
after
the
first
definitely
for
those
who
enjoy
hot
pepper
heat
thought
in
the
scheme
of
things
it
was
relatively
mild
if
you
dont
like
peppers
why
would
you
drink
this
bunch
of
masochists
apparently
do
my
mouth
is
on
fire
but
not
like
a
buffalo
wild
wings
blazin
wings
challenge
fire
this
one
is
tolerable
most
will
only
want
one
pint
but
it
is
different
and
demands
a
try
i
love
this
beer
it
has
the
bent
river
american
wheat
beer
base
with
a
brightfresh
jalapeno
taste
i
really
dont
care
for
any
other
flavored
beers
like
strawberry
or
raspberry
but
this
is
wonderful
there
is
a
slight
burn
so
people
who
dont
like
the
burn
of
hot
salsa
probably
wont
like
it
the
only
drawback
is
that
sometimes
it
can
be
a
little
flat
i
dont
know
why
it
happens
with
this
beer
at
bent
but
i
havent
seen
it
with
the
others
they
serve
conclusion
my
fiancee
hated
it
but
i
actually
thought
this
was
kind
of
interesting
its
definitely
not
something
youd
sit
around
and
pound
down
but
with
a
bacon
cheeseburger
pub
fries
with
cheese
onion
rings
or
the
like
this
one
pint
tops
could
be
quite
tasty
if
youre
a
lover
of
hot
and
pepper
if
you
have
strongflavored
food
to
pair
it
with
if
you
just
have
to
say
youve
tried
it
be
my
guest
but
this
is
one
beer
ill
pass
on
and
one
that
gives
another
black
mark
for
me
against
fruit
and
vegetable
beers
in
general
this
was
really
my
first
introduction
to
a
pepper
beer
i
liked
it
but
i
couldnt
drink
this
all
night
but
its
good
for
a
pint
or
two
it
did
inspire
me
to
brew
a
pepper
beer
of
my
own
however
well
this
is
my
style
of
beer
in
fact
it
tastes
pleasantly
like
a
chile
beer
ive
made
appears
to
be
a
golden
american
ale
base
but
lighter
on
the
hops
chile
burn
is
there
but
bright
and
fruity
like
fresh
jalapenos
actually
finishes
clean
with
no
afterburn
this
is
to
this
chilehead
the
equal
of
eskes
in
taos
o
the
beer
is
good
at
refrigerator
temperature
but
it
improvessignificant
in
the
50s
f
this
is
unusual
very
well
done
balanced
and
enjoyable
interesting
beer
subtle
cocao
taste
with
a
lil
spice
very
different
tasting
than
most
beers
i
used
to
poured
a
one
finger
head
that
disapated
fairly
quickly
this
medium
amber
unfiltered
ale
first
hits
you
with
a
sour
smell
but
eventually
fades
the
taste
of
honey
and
cacao
are
present
with
little
heat
from
the
chilies
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
beer
and
look
forward
to
having
another
one
soon
nice
golden
color
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
has
a
pleasant
honeyfruity
aromoa
and
taste
not
much
chili
or
cacao
taste
but
a
slight
spicy
bite
on
the
end
slightly
on
the
sourwild
side
a
bit
too
much
sediment
but
could
have
been
my
pour
unfiltered
craft
goodness
heavy
and
light
simultaneously
cacao
enhances
the
beer
and
leaves
a
clean
finish
most
pepper
or
other
flavor
additives
leave
an
unpleasant
and
overpowering
aftertaste
but
dfh
has
avoided
this
and
provided
us
with
a
true
nectar
of
the
gods
much
thinner
than
i
expected
no
lacing
at
all
pretty
flat
color
makes
it
look
like
unfiltered
apple
cider
nose
is
fruitier
than
expected
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
the
chilies
it
is
infused
with
i
thought
the
cocoa
would
be
more
forward
expected
bitter
chocolate
flavor
that
wasnt
there
very
different
than
what
i
thought
i
would
get
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
get
it
again
theobroma
pours
a
darker
golden
color
with
a
nice
size
head
there
is
a
big
chili
aroma
with
just
hints
of
sweetness
from
the
chocolate
nice
chili
flavors
just
hints
of
chocolate
nice
warm
from
the
spice
good
blend
of
flavors
nice
body
overall
its
very
nice
easy
to
drink
good
beer
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
heat
from
the
chilis
amazingly
balanced
and
unique
this
is
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
was
like
a
very
watery
budweiser
had
this
one
at
the
dfh
alehouse
on
tap
in
gaithersburg
md
very
solid
brew
dont
really
pick
up
the
chile
spices
at
all
no
hotness
this
was
a
good
thing
as
most
chili
spiced
beers
have
been
a
deterent
to
me
so
far
recommend
its
not
how
it
looks
its
how
it
drives
an
analogy
i
often
apply
to
to
choosing
a
bomber
but
sometimes
something
is
just
too
aesthetically
intriguing
to
pass
up
which
is
the
case
in
point
and
i
ended
up
with
the
dfhs
theobroma
when
i
popped
the
cap
it
seemed
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
built
up
as
the
pop
was
mighty
loud
but
there
was
no
foaming
of
any
sort
it
poured
fairly
light
with
healthily
active
2
5
inch
head
thats
assisted
by
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
its
a
deep
gold
almost
orange
with
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
hanging
about
in
there
but
the
beer
itself
isnt
extremely
hazy
the
cocoa
is
the
first
aroma
but
much
lighter
in
presence
than
i
had
expected
as
well
as
honey
mixed
amongst
it
also
a
very
light
earthy
spicy
bitterness
hits
the
palate
as
the
beer
first
enters
your
mouth
trailed
by
tastes
that
match
the
aromas
the
cocoa
isnt
overbearing
and
the
beer
is
much
more
savory
than
i
had
assumed
after
pouring
it
the
finish
is
dry
but
still
very
smooth
as
the
ancho
chilies
give
an
amazing
and
extremely
approachable
amount
of
heat
to
the
cocoa
elements
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
acts
as
a
fantastic
platform
to
allow
this
beer
to
shine
and
accompanies
each
facet
of
the
beer
nicely
overall
this
beer
is
surpassing
my
expectations
on
many
levels
and
im
impressed
at
the
amount
of
complexity
this
beer
offers
while
still
remaining
extremely
approachable
to
a
variety
of
craft
brew
seekers
its
not
how
it
looks
its
how
it
drives
and
she
drives
quite
nicely
another
great
brew
cheers
o
i
expected
the
usual
stylized
dogfish
head
brew
rife
with
flavor
and
only
subtle
beer
hints
what
i
got
was
the
opposite
a
chalky
beer
with
only
subtle
hints
of
what
was
advertised
on
the
verge
of
being
a
bad
beer
dont
know
what
happened
here
o
overall
this
reminds
me
most
of
a
wheatwine
or
braggot
the
nose
and
palate
are
somewhat
soft
but
wow
the
palate
is
so
softly
complex
i
am
a
big
fan
of
brews
that
use
chilies
peppersespicially
portersstouts
but
this
one
takes
the
complexity
to
a
whole
new
level
weighting
appearance
15
smell
15
taste
35
mouthfeel
15
overall
20
really
misses
the
mark
tastes
like
a
bad
mixed
drink
this
was
excellent
and
the
best
ancient
ale
ive
had
so
far
wow
what
an
interesting
beer
if
you
are
in
a
beer
store
and
need
something
that
doesnt
fit
into
any
of
the
other
styles
this
is
it
a
beer
this
color
blonde
has
no
right
to
taste
like
this
the
is
chocolate
peppers
yet
smoothness
the
cocoa
hits
first
but
the
finish
is
this
hard
to
describe
soft
heat
dogfish
doing
what
it
does
best
making
you
rejudge
every
sip
light
chocolatey
brown
pour
decent
clarity
large
white
head
that
dissipates
relatively
quickly
very
complex
flavor
none
of
the
individual
components
take
the
lead
but
they
all
work
well
together
chili
peppers
provide
sharpness
but
no
burn
and
the
beer
has
a
boozy
finish
i
expected
a
chocolate
flavor
which
i
didnt
detect
but
overall
i
liked
it
a
bit
steep
of
a
price
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
tap
pours
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
wheat
and
chocolate
tastes
of
wheat
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
chilies
sweet
aftertaste
very
unique
beer
i
liked
it
theobroma
pours
a
dazzling
copper
hue
but
with
very
little
head
indicating
a
minimal
amount
of
carbonation
as
other
reviewers
pointed
out
the
aroma
is
faint
however
there
is
a
bit
of
cocoa
powder
detectable
in
a
whiff
of
it
the
high
malt
flavor
pairs
well
with
the
cocoa
and
the
chilies
blend
in
a
similar
way
with
the
sharpness
of
the
finish
and
the
alcohol
heat
with
a
medium
mouth
feel
this
can
sneak
up
on
you
however
overall
worth
a
try
and
best
shared
overall
3
5
more
cocoa
than
any
pepper
or
chili
profile
overall
enjoyable
and
medium
body
id
day
this
beer
is
more
interesting
than
tasty
thats
not
to
sat
that
its
bad
just
that
some
of
the
elements
of
this
beer
seem
out
of
whack
and
not
conducive
to
others
overall
i
would
by
this
beer
just
to
taste
some
history
plus
its
damn
good
so
bonus
this
beer
is
at
9abv
so
a
nice
choice
for
your
nightly
night
cap
cheers
notes
always
a
treat
this
is
a
special
brew
an
extremely
well
balanced
and
well
made
beer
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
clean
crisp
head
smells
of
chilies
faintly
along
with
some
notes
of
malt
the
taste
is
well
balanced
with
an
excellent
mouthfeel
it
is
creamy
on
the
on
the
palate
with
a
medium
body
excellent
beer
terrible
no
chile
or
cocoachocolate
tasted
like
a
cross
between
a
hefeweizen
and
budweiser
save
your
money
for
something
else
every
dogfish
beer
i
continue
to
try
i
get
more
disappointed
each
time
o
this
beer
must
be
served
at
teh
right
temperature
to
taste
all
the
nuance
i
know
this
is
a
duh
type
thing
but
when
it
hits
is
stride
it
is
a
very
refreshing
spicy
beer
hobo
chang
ba
this
unexpected
dfh
ale
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
taste
the
appearance
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
lasting
white
head
and
lacing
the
nose
is
a
subtle
blend
of
sweetness
chile
heat
and
alcohol
i
get
nearly
no
chocolate
or
cocoa
at
all
the
mouth
is
light
and
smooth
very
sippable
and
enjoyable
the
flavor
is
light
and
slightly
european
there
is
a
pleasant
sweetness
on
the
front
and
ancho
heat
on
the
tail
still
nothing
present
that
id
call
chocolate
this
is
very
good
but
nothing
like
id
expect
from
the
label
dfh
always
keeps
em
good
and
interesting
onot
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
but
that
turned
out
to
be
a
good
thing
i
really
enjoyed
the
chocolaty
taste
without
the
weight
of
a
stout
and
again
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
had
drinks
very
easy
for
a
9
beer
this
beer
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
i
love
dogfish
head
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
i
prefer
my
chocolate
beers
in
stout
form
overall
a
well
disguised
pepper
beer
not
a
lot
of
chocolate
flavor
which
i
came
in
expecting
just
a
pleasant
tasty
amber
with
a
surprising
finish
a
fun
if
expensive
sipper
o
theobroma
keeps
in
line
with
dogfishs
unusual
ancient
beers
but
this
high
alcohol
sweet
beer
teeters
on
the
edge
of
being
cloying
thankfully
balanced
with
a
little
pinch
of
chili
heat
on
the
finish
the
chocolate
aspect
seems
a
little
lost
in
the
fray
only
appearing
as
dusty
dried
cocoa
in
small
amounts
i
am
perplexed
slightly
by
this
beer
doing
this
review
i
have
edited
it
twice
now
and
still
am
having
trouble
describing
it
exactly
i
can
say
the
chile
builds
up
on
the
tongue
oh
so
subtly
it
is
quite
interesting
this
one
wasnt
one
of
my
favorites
personally
but
it
was
good
and
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
o
say
what
you
want
but
dfh
is
one
if
not
the
most
innovative
largescale
american
craft
breweries
and
continues
to
deliver
time
and
again
theobroma
is
no
exception
and
is
my
handsdown
favorite
offering
from
their
ancient
ales
series
with
sahtea
ranking
as
a
close
second
furthermore
this
also
ranks
highly
on
my
list
of
alltime
favorite
beers
even
with
almost
9
months
of
age
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
however
i
will
be
anticipating
its
release
in
2014
to
experience
this
one
fresh
4
75
from
the
description
i
expected
a
dark
beer
and
since
i
was
sharing
this
with
a
friend
we
were
both
surprised
by
the
cloudy
yellowish
orange
color
taste
was
excellent
really
picked
up
the
honey
and
the
slight
heat
at
the
end
didnt
really
pick
up
the
cocoa
but
i
think
this
is
what
was
helping
to
give
it
a
great
balance
in
the
flavor
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
was
very
refreshing
beer
and
another
example
of
the
excellence
of
dogfish
head
pours
clean
with
a
light
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
gives
notes
of
fruit
and
chilies
the
flavor
was
of
sweetened
fruits
annatto
and
a
subtle
chili
flavor
the
chilies
did
not
come
through
in
the
taste
as
they
did
in
the
nose
but
what
did
was
very
tasty
cocoa
flavors
did
not
come
through
but
the
end
result
is
a
blend
that
makes
a
world
class
beer
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
heat
but
even
without
it
is
well
balanced
a
wonderfully
brewed
beer
drinks
well
now
and
should
age
well
over
the
next
couple
of
years
overall
outstanding
i
will
be
putting
some
in
the
cellar
750
ml
bottle
into
signature
tulip
glass
bottled

pours
moderately
hazycloudy
golden

with
a
1

head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
on
the

with
a
good

is
very
well

only
a
small

present
after
the

overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
ancient

style
all
around
nice

and
very
smooth
to

a

offering
beerandwhiskeyhq
o
nothing
redeemable
about
this
beer
unless
you
are
looking
for
a
historical
recreation
youd
be
willing
to
throw
away
from
my
tasting
notes
it
was
light
golden
in
color
which
was
unexpected
considering
their
use
of
cocoa
powder
and
cocoa
nibs
it
had
a
distinct
chocolate
flavor
as
you
would
expect
with
a
subtle
chili
burn
on
the
finish
the
beer
avoided
being
an
overpowering
bomb
of
chocolate
although
slightly
sweet
and
malty
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
and
hid
the
high
alcohol
content
dogfish
head
managed
to
create
a
very
original
beer
that
was
unlike
anything
i
had
tried
before
it
was
definitely
a
sweet
surprise
this
beer
looks
really
cool
when
poured
it
is
a
bright
golden
amber
slightly
hazy
with
lots
of
sediment
my
favorite
part
is
there
is
nonstop
rapid
moving
bubbles
from
every
inch
of
surface
of
the
glass
that
rapidly
ascend
and
push
up
on
the
descending
sediment
making
a
rolling
turbulent
effect
in
the
glass
as
the
two
interact
very
enticing
and
fun
to
watch
nice
fluffy
white
head
too
smell
is
mostly
bread
honey
and
chiles
for
me
taste
has
lots
of
yeast
and
sweet
honey
faint
flavor
of
cocoa
that
lends
itself
well
to
the
texture
leaves
some
lingering
chile
heat
mouthfeel
is
moderate
carbonation
milder
than
expected
it
has
a
silky
quality
that
compliments
the
chocolate
flavors
overall
a
superb
easydrinker
some
new
flavor
combinations
here
that
are
worth
checking
out
overall
theobroma
is
a
unique
and
heavyduty
drink
and
one
im
glad
to
have
experienced
would
i
get
another
bottle
likely
not
unless
i
knew
it
was
very
fresh
i
consider
chile
beers
to
be
a
novelty
and
this
beer
to
be
very
novel
its
not
a
beer
to
drink
every
day
but
its
an
amazing
beer
to
try
o
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
different
from
the
standard
fare
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
body
and
more
of
the
chocolatechile
but
even
then
it
was
still
wellcrafted
very
interesting
brew
from
dfh
exotic
but
accessible
again
glad
to
try
this
experimental
beer
but
not
a
keeper
in
my
mind
o
interesting
combination
the
chocolate
is
so
subtle
it
is
hard
to
detect
the
hot
peppers
are
certainly
obvious
but
they
are
not
too
harsh
to
me
it
lacks
in
malt
backbone
to
support
these
diverse
flavors
edit
i
see
in
the
description
on
the
bottle
and
this
site
that
they
seem
to
be
aiming
for
a
chocolateesque
brew
not
really
getting
that
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
to
me
thats
what
chocolate
stouts
are
for
o
overall
i
feel
let
down
on
this
beer
i
was
expecting
more
complexity
to
taste
some
cocoa
some
chilies
and
in
the
end
i
was
left
with
an
ordinary
beer
to
the
regular
beer
lover
i
could
probably
recommend
it
if
they
could
get
past
the
price
but
to
the
dfh
eccentric
i
would
say
look
elsewhere
in
their
portfolio
i
rated
it
as
an
okay
beer
because
i
felt
it
was
good
enough
to
drink
and
enjoy
but
it
wasnt
anything
past
that
excellent
complexedflavored
beer
not
my
personal
style
but
surprisingly
addicting
as
the
beer
warms
this
beer
is
spectacular
it
has
a
medium
body
but
drinks
so
lightly
it
has
every
food
that
brings
comfort
warmth
and
joy
its
full
and
earthy
but
retains
an
almost
divine
lightness
you
could
sip
it
all
day
and
be
warmed
by
it
the
peppers
are
so
well
done
as
to
be
authentic
but
carefully
presented
so
as
not
be
like
fire
leave
it
to
dogfish
head
to
bring
back
a
beer
from
1200
bc
and
celebrate
the
culture
and
history
of
great
people
and
great
beer
poured
from
tap
into
snifter
at
dfh
in
fairfax
va
i
dont
know
why
but
i
thought
this
would
be
dark
like
a
stout
pours
an
orange
color
with
very
thin
white
lacing
aromas
of
tart
stonefruit
sweet
belgian
type
yeast
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
really
unique
like
expected
sweet
malty
belgian
type
yeast
with
a
nice
tart
chocolate
backbone
the
chile
is
subtle
but
it
finishes
with
a
tad
bit
of
heat
its
a
very
well
balanced
unique
brew
very
rarely
do
you
find
an
experimental
brew
with
such
a
balance
really
nice
and
well
worth
the
price
tag
i
see
it
going
for
in
the
store
but
superb
on
tap
fun
i
liked
this
a
lot
as
always
thanks
dogfish
head
in
the
end
its
not
bad
but
not
really
interesting
either
not
really
spicy
but
well
crafted
and
decent
drinking
o
not
really
my
style
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
the
9
alcohol
is
well
hidden
o
i
was
surprised
by
how
light
this
beer
was
i
read
that
it
had
cocoa
nibs
and
was
expecting
a
darker
brew
the
pepper
was
also
not
as
pronounced
as
i
expected
the
honey
and
floral
aspects
were
nice
i
guess
i
was
more
caught
off
guard
by
characteristics
of
this
beer
i
expected
a
dark
cocoa
pepper
beer
and
got
a
light
honey
floral
pepper
beer
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
that
is
as
complex
as
i
have
ever
tried
cocoa
nibs
and
malt
and
spice
lend
itself
to
a
very
smooth
drinkable
liquid
effervescence
leaves
early
on
but
is
necessary
to
bring
out
the
true
flavor
profile
especially
good
with
a
padron
londres
natural
cigar
o
it
comes
across
a
bit
more
meadlike
than
i
was
expecting
and
its
perhaps
a
little
too
mild
for
its
own
good
however
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
through
the
bottle
seamless
marriage
of
flavors
and
over
the
top
smoothness
are
the
shining
points
would
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
as
a
digestif
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
was
very
nice
it
is
a
bronzed
orange
color
which
was
very
unexpected
and
it
had
a
nice
1234
head
with
nice
lacing
i
loved
the
smell
it
had
a
very
spicy
smell
i
could
smell
the
chilies
the
chilies
were
also
very
apparent
on
first
taste
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
i
liked
the
chili
flavor
but
the
subtle
chocolate
on
the
back
end
made
it
very
nice
the
spiciness
also
added
to
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
the
tight
carbonation
with
the
spice
of
the
chilies
gave
it
a
very
zingy
feel
on
the
tongue
which
was
surprising
overall
i
think
this
beer
was
a
big
surprise
from
the
pour
to
the
finish
but
it
was
a
surprise
i
enjoyed
this
is
another
wacky
beerlike
creation
from
this
brewer
that
assembles
the
elements
of
a
distinct
foodstuff
to
stuff
in
a
glass
and
float
a
head
on
it
the
ingredients
are
there
and
its
a
creative
effort
but
the
blend
just
doesnt
produce
a
good
brew
i
feel
like
ive
been
given
some
variety
of
aztec
medicine
instead
this
is
a
unique
beer
lots
of
levels
sweet
and
spicy
a
nice
dessert
beer
really
quite
tasty
and
one
of
the
better
of
the
strange
range
of
dogfish
brews
i
was
happy
to
try
it
on
tap
doing
a
joint
review
not
much
time
to
do
a
proper
review
very
chili
forward
and
baking
cocoa
powder
lots
of
spice
real
interesting
the
color
is
much
lighter
than
expected
sweet
caramel
syrup
i
taste
something
like
pears
in
here
very
chili
forward
if
you
like
some
spice
most
definitely
worth
a
shot
leaves
the
mouth
coated
a
sipper
in
my
opinion
something
to
enjoy
with
good
food
however
it
does
especially
in
small
portions
work
well
as
a
dessert
beer
which
is
exactly
what
we
used
this
for
to
great
success
i
actually
admit
that
i
was
won
over
by
this
beer
as
i
am
a
fan
of
spicy
choco
delicacies
but
i
would
have
never
been
able
to
even
finish
half
of
a
bottle
by
myself
it
coulda
made
one
helluva
stout
but
hey
whatever
somehow
this
all
worked
together
and
i
think
calagione
probably
wants
people
to
divide
this
thing
as
a
digestif
or
something
similar
this
impressed
me
far
more
than
midas
touch
and
i
really
hope
to
try
others
from
this
series
pushes
the
boundaries
of
fermented
barley
beverages
as
always
very
interesting
stuff
o
not
an
everyday
drinker
but
a
terrific
beer
for
special
afternoons
the
chili
peppers
create
a
warming
of
the
face
and
head
while
the
subtle
9
alcohol
warms
the
chest
something
in
this
ancient
recipe
still
delivers
the
magic
the
maya
knew
about
3000
years
ago
an
afternoon
fades
into
laughter
and
relaxation
theobroma
means
food
of
the
gods
i
can
see
why
the
maya
thought
this
recipe
should
be
reserved
for
their
kings
overallid
drink
this
brew
again
i
am
surprised
impressed
and
satisfied
take
a
chance
with
something
different
o
reading
the
label
i
had
expected
a
darker
brew
to
my
surprise
it
had
a
lighter
malt
which
ended
up
playing
in
very
well
there
is
a
real
nice
complexity
here
and
the
chile
is
at
a
perfect
level
present
but
not
overkill
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
chile
beers
ive
had
o
very
surprising
but
in
a
good
way
from
the
color
to
the
flavors
good
complexity
decent
drinkability
and
a
good
balance
of
flavors
overall
thoughts
from
the
way
the
beer
is
described
on
the
label
having
been
brewed
with
cocoa
powder
and
nibs
askinosie
chocolate
honey
ancho
chilies
and
annatto
i
was
expecting
a
dark
beer
like
a
mexican
mole
sauce
and
the
dark
golden
honey
color
totally
surprised
me
and
the
surprises
kept
coming
i
found
this
beer
extremely
complex
and
exceptionally
good
o
interesting
brew
tons
of
flavors
constantly
changing
in
the
mouth
if
this
is
what
the
ancients
brewed
beer
mustve
been
amazing
awesome
story
aside
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
produced
a
thin
white
head
and
featured
average
retention
and
it
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
consisted
of
cocoa
spicy
pepper
and
honey
medium
bodied
there
is
a
foundation
of
cereal
grains
sweet
honey
and
dark
fruit
spicy
pepper
nutmeg
smooth
choclate
and
subtle
hints
of
chilies
beer
warms
at
the
finishdry
overall
awesome
beer
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
heat
from
the
chili
peppers
but
still
highly
recommended
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
that
begs
you
to
ask
where
is
the
chilies
in
this
beer
then
as
the
beer
warms
you
go
from
a
balance
of
sweet
honey
and
chocolate
to
nice
spicy
chilies
an
enjoyable
beer
o
complex
flavors
combine
for
a
fun
chocolatey
experience
that
makes
this
beer
fun
to
drink
different
tastes
come
out
with
each
sip
will
definitely
enjoy
again
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
with
a
story
to
tell
both
in
its
formation
and
on
the
palate
im
trying
this
brew
several
months
old
and
i
wonder
if
the
chocolate
would
be
more
apparent
if
i
had
the
chance
to
drink
this
super
fresh
this
is
definitely
the
best
dogfishs
ancient
ale
series
i
have
had
the
chance
to
try
highly
recommend
for
the
adventurous
beer
enthusiast
3
5o
a
very
curious
beer
and
one
id
be
interested
to
have
again
lightly
recommended
for
experimental
drinkers
but
not
everyday
fare
or
objectively
great
o
mild
smell
and
flavor
overall
but
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
nice
mouthfeel
i
was
kind
of
shocked
when
i
poured
this
theobroma
from
dogfish
head
because
it
has
cocoa
powder
in
it
i
assumed
it
would
be
a
dark
beer
it
is
actually
light
and
a
cloudy
gold
color
the
smell
is
unassuming
and
milder
thank
you
would
think
its
a
lot
more
flavorful
than
the
taste
would
lead
you
to
believe
you
can
chocolate
which
isnt
sweet
at
all
and
goes
really
goes
really
good
with
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
there
is
also
some
honey
in
here
which
doesnt
over
power
the
flavor
just
makes
it
a
little
milder
that
with
the
light
carbonation
actually
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
id
been
forewarned
by
bartender
that
this
was
not
a
dark
beer
that
was
okay
with
me
ive
enjoyed
sonoras
white
chocolate
ale
and
its
also
straw
colored
my
4ounce
taster
of
theobroma
had
that
straw
look
with
a
bit
of
haze
i
got
no
chocolate
on
the
nose
and
no
chocolate
in
the
taste
but
i
got
plenty
of
chile
on
the
end
in
the
back
of
my
throat
i
liked
that
part
overall
though
it
was
not
the
most
interesting
thing
ive
had
from
dfh
i
had
been
waiting
an
extended
time
to
try
theobroma
did
i
set
my
expectations
too
high
for
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
chocolate
elements
i
was
not
expecting
a
golden
colored
beer
with
a
slight
white
head
honey
notes
were
the
most
prominent
in
the
aroma
with
noting
else
really
jumping
out
in
the
initial
taste
one
detects
mild
chocolate
grape
and
a
slight
sweetness
after
a
few
sips
the
heat
becomes
a
little
more
noticeable
at
the
back
of
the
throat
ancho
chilies
hold
a
little
more
promise
for
me
but
the
heat
was
very
mild
in
the
aftertaste
one
detects
a
grapey
taste
almost
like
grape
soda
with
all
of
the
elements
of
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
quite
different
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
an
almost
clear
darker
golden
color
there
was
a
small
white
head
that
didnt
linger
long
nice
nose
a
little
musty
to
start
some
notes
of
honey
and
the
cocoa
the
taste
is
good
a
bit
of
the
cocoa
on
top
but
not
overdone
a
faint
amount
of
the
peppers
but
no
heat
or
any
real
bite
from
them
a
touch
dry
in
the
finish
and
very
smooth
very
nice
poured
from
a
crown
capped
large
format
bottle
a
bit
north
of
fridge
temp
into
a
tulip
liquor
is
medium
amber
a
bit
hazy
maybe
the
bottle
had
been
a
bit
disturbed
with
a
fairly
small
head
that
falls
apart
quickly
no
lacing
at
all
lots
of
very
small
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
the
nose
is
a
complex
yet
balanced
amalgam
of
chiles
earth
and
bitter
chocolate
which
follows
through
to
the
palate
a
slight
honey
character
comes
through
midway
through
with
a
nutty
roastiness
showing
up
as
well
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
cocoa
and
dried
chile
note
although
this
seems
like
it
should
be
muddled
it
somehow
manages
to
achieve
a
nearly
perfect
balance
the
chile
flavor
is
obvious
but
there
is
only
the
subtlest
hint
of
heat
this
is
an
outstanding
if
very
difficult
to
categorize
beer
surprisingly
drinkable
o
so
much
going
on
with
this
beer
it
needs
to
be
experienced
not
consumed
with
a
meal
or
as
part
of
a
tasting
flight
this
beer
demands
individual
attention
that
being
said
it
is
an
experience
like
no
other
leave
your
preconceived
notions
at
the
door
poured
entire
bottle
into
34oz
mug
clear
gold
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
smell
is
rather
flat
some
of
the
sour
yeast
smell
present
in
its
sister
brew
sahtea
is
noticeable
bitter
cocoa
over
the
malts
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
twang
from
the
peppers
taste
is
sweet
malts
cocoa
and
the
taste
pinches
to
a
close
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
where
the
chilies
make
their
muted
appearance
not
sure
id
notice
them
if
i
didnt
know
they
were
there
still
an
enjoyable
beer
hides
the
alcohol
well
for
9
which
is
a
bit
insidious
considering
it
comes
in
a
22oz
bottle
o
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
for
me
and
it
took
a
few
sips
for
me
to
truly
appreciate
it
i
really
love
the
spice
of
this
beer
and
it
is
truly
enjoyable
to
sip
from
a
snifter
i
poured
this
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
2
white
head
that
stays
in
tact
for
a
while
the
smell
is
strictly
honey
to
my
nose
the
taste
has
a
nice
sweetntess
from
the
honey
up
front
then
a
little
bit
from
the
anchos
comes
along
to
finish
it
off
i
dont
really
get
any
chocolate
from
it
the
mouth
feel
is
really
nice
rolls
off
the
tongue
nice
with
just
a
little
bit
of
the
pepers
on
the
back
of
the
tonuge
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
by
dfh
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
when
i
received
it
from
a
client
at
xmas
this
beer
pour
beautiful
bright
amber
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
the
beer
entered
smooth
with
good
carbonation
citrus
nose
with
a
soft
chocolate
taste
i
waited
for
the
heat
from
the
chilies
after
the
third
taste
a
mild
tingle
filled
my
mouth
while
the
sweetness
of
honey
rendered
it
helpless
we
will
have
this
one
again

o
overall
this
was
definitely
something
different
it
wasnt
particularly
great
but
it
was
good
only
complaint
is
that
this
beer
actually
seems
to
go
flat
pretty
fast
and
i
really
wish
the
flavors
would
have
exploded
instead
of
staying
predominantly
subdued
o
my
first
thought
was
that
a
beer
with
peppers
cocoa
and
ground
annato
might
be
potentially
disturbing
i
was
wrong
the
cocoa
is
not
overpowering
and
with
the
honey
balances
out
the
chilies
and
spices
really
well
an
interesting
and
well
done
offering
from
dogfish
i
treated
myself
to
this
for
new
years
eve
unfortunately
i
didnt
make
it
due
to
the
3
750ml
strong
ales
i
started
with
so
its
my
new
years
day
ale
it
has
a
nice
chocolatey
citrus
nose
with
a
perfect
balance
of
cocoa
chilies
and
honey
on
the
pallet
delicious
o
this
is
an
interesting
brew
like
a
lot
of
dfh
beers
that
ive
had
its
somewhat
underwhelming
after
reading
the
explanation
on
the
bottle
the
cocoa
is
only
subtly
noticeable
while
the
chilies
seem
to
take
the
forefront
even
after
looking
at
this
as
a
chile
beer
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
style
nevertheless
its
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
my
initial
pour
netted
two
fingers
of
foamy
fizzy
french
vanillacolored
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
spicy
pepperiness
that
seemed
to
tickle
the
back
of
my
throat
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
way
that
the
spice
was
muted
yet
present
and
discernible
was
quite
unexpected
i
seem
to
remember
it
as
much
more
pronounced
but
this
was
really
pleasant
the
chocolate
seemed
to
get
lost
in
the
mix
as
i
really
did
not
perceive
it
until
the
extreme
finish
the
finish
itself
was
dry
but
not
gaspingly
so
as
one
might
expect
from
the
presence
of
chile
good
stuff
bottle
is
a
2010
vintage
from
my
cellar
i
drank
it
tonight
to
celebrate
the
world
not
ending
and
the
mayans
being
wrong
after
all
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
carbonation
definitely
has
diminished
over
the
two
years
bright
orange
colored
body
which
was
not
what
i
expected
from
a
beer
brewed
with
chocolate
smell
was
sweet
taste
was
very
interesting
the
honey
was
really
up
front
followed
by
the
hint
of
chili
at
the
end
this
beer
is
what
would
happen
if
dfh
made
a
mead
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
i
give
this
beer
extra
points
because
it
surprised
me
but
i
still
liked
it
overall
a
lot
going
on
but
i
love
it
the
taste
is
all
over
the
place
but
i
really
enjoy
it
i
normally
like
to
enjoy
beer
with
a
meal
or
snack
but
i
took
this
none
by
itself
its
like
a
savory
dessert
in
a
bottle
will
definitely
try
again
and
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
something
new
and
exciting
cheers
one
of
the
more
interesting
archeological
dogfish
brews
the
pour
is
a
really
bright
bronze
color
with
a
lot
of
suspended
spent
yeast
looks
like
a
snow
globe
short
white
lace
rests
on
top
the
nose
is
sweet
and
floral
from
the
honey
with
a
touch
of
smoke
and
spice
from
the
ancho
peppers
and
some
unique
earthy
character
which
i
can
only
imagine
comes
from
those
annatto
tree
seeds
the
flavor
really
features
the
honey
theres
a
mild
sweetness
throughout
with
some
undertones
of
raw
cacao
but
no
decadent
chocolate
to
this
at
all
more
of
an
organic
bitterness
like
cocoa
powder
the
chili
pepper
flavor
is
very
mild
and
really
only
comes
into
play
in
the
finish
providing
just
a
touch
of
warmth
which
combined
with
the
alcohol
actually
produces
a
beautiful
conclusion
to
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
works
it
could
stand
a
little
more
carbonation
i
think
but
the
body
is
soft
and
round
plenty
drinkable
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
in
this
series
of
old
world
recreations
o
nice
beer
but
nothing
stands
out
definitely
not
chileforward
overall
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
having
it
again
full
review
here
httpbit
lyujv5gp
the
aroma
contains
notes
of
chocolate
chilies
grass
and
some
light
pale
lager
aromas
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
lots
of
fine
sediment
and
a
large
yellowtinged
creamy
head
the
flavor
starts
with
some
light
chocolate
and
sweet
lager
flavors
the
chilies
are
noticeable
in
the
background
that
slightly
increases
in
the
finish
and
mixes
with
some
faint
grassiness
mediumbodied
with
light
carbonation
overall
im
liking
the
idea
of
dogfish
head
ancient
brew
series
and
im
going
to
give
this
beer
a
nod
of
approval
mostly
because
it
tastes
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
the
only
down
side
is
this
beer
was
quite
expensive
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
i
dont
know
how
it
was
priced
elsewhere
but
here
i
was
looking
at
over
15
for
a
bottle
o
disappointed
overall
for
a
chile
beer
brewed
with
herbs
spices
and
cocoa
i
sure
didnt
get
any
chocolate
character
out
of
this
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
that
plays
with
the
spiciness
ever
so
slightly
but
its
almost
too
faint
to
mention
o
not
my
style
too
much
going
on
and
not
a
fan
of
chiles
in
brew
hot
finish
and
i
cant
dectect
the
cocoa
im
going
to
briefly
describe
this
overall
the
appearance
is
light
and
gold
with
little
head
it
smells
very
sweet
but
finishes
with
spice
i
get
sweetness
and
honey
in
the
beginning
with
spice
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
overall
it
may
be
because
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
i
feel
like
this
beer
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
beer
that
came
recommended
average
for
me
o
i
tend
to
like
the
dfh
experimental
beers
but
this
one
ill
pass
on
it
just
seemed
a
bit
of
a
mixmatch
that
didnt
do
any
one
thing
really
good
poured
from
a
25
4oz
bottle
into
a
large
snifter
nice
amber
honey
hue
with
some
cloudiness
from
the
yeast
modest
amount
of
lace
on
the
side
of
glass
aroma
is
strong
malt
and
almost
winey
strong
alcohol
overtones
chile
pepper
becomes
apparent
in
the
flavor
very
sweet
not
a
highly
hopped
or
floral
beer
some
bitterness
from
chocolate
nibs
very
robust
mouth
feel
with
some
heat
due
to
alcohol
and
peppers
overall
a
very
unusual
and
interesting
beer
final
thoughts
its
not
everyday
you
see
a
light
colored
chocolate
beer
so
thats
unique
in
itself
this
is
an
all
around
interesting
and
likable
beer
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
if
it
was
shared
among
friends
or
in
otherwise
small
doses
o
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
pleasantly
sweet
a
nice
diversity
of
flavors
the
cocoa
wasnt
very
prominent
in
the
taste
but
was
more
present
in
the
nose
nice
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
id
say
with
a
few
exceptions
i
like
dogfish
heads
experiments
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
with
nice
flavor
transitions
a
great
flavor
profile
and
a
good
easy
drinking
feel
well
worth
a
try
overall
not
knowing
what
the
hell
the
name
meant
i
was
stunned
when
the
chocolatey
taste
hit
my
mouth
especially
after
the
orange
pour
its
a
tasty
beer
and
goes
down
smoothly
at
9
abv
definitely
grows
on
you
as
you
dink
it
just
finished
the
bottle
and
i
am
yearning
for
another
flavor
wise
it
has
more
spicy
pepper
than
chocolate
going
on
its
on
the
medium
level
viscosity
wise
with
a
balanced
amount
of
carbonation
its
spicyness
stacks
in
between
sips
kind
of
like
bitter
hops
and
eventually
overpowers
all
that
was
cocoa
in
the
flavor
overall
this
unusual
beer
is
well
worth
trying
even
going
a
little
out
of
your
way
for
sip
it
ponder
it
and
enjoy
this
food
of
the
gods
o
just
an
all
around
amazing
beer
i
was
expecting
for
this
to
have
a
chocolate
style
flavor
but
i
really
dont
get
any
of
that
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
since
i
love
chocolate
and
spice
but
it
ended
up
being
a
little
dissapointing
all
i
got
initially
was
honey
a
sweet
subtle
beer
but
the
chile
only
came
through
as
the
beer
got
warmer
the
chocolate
never
materialized
glad
i
tried
it
once
but
wont
be
getting
it
again
overall
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
but
it
gets
a
bit
overwhelming
in
its
flavors
after
the
first
few
sips
although
the
individual
components
of
the
beer
are
great
they
dont
really
come
together
to
form
a
beer
that
you
will
relish
sometimes
simplcity
is
better
than
the
highly
complex
nature
of
this
beer
i
think
this
beer
needs
more
time
and
effort
to
be
perfected
or
at
least
improved
upon
d
for
a
brew
of
such
strength
and
odd
nature
this
is
solidly
drinkable
between
the
alcohol
chile
and
cocoa
im
feeling
an
absolute
sense
of
euphoria
right
now
its
almost
inspiring
the
mesoamerican
nobility
must
have
been
running
around
like
crazy
fools
if
they
were
gettin
high
on
this
stuff
it
belongs
in
a
snifter
or
narrowmouthed
tulip
to
concentrate
the
nuanced
aroma
and
hell
quite
frankly
next
time
ill
treat
it
like
scotch
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
dfhs
recreation
of
ancient
brews
but
this
one
is
a
straight
banger
overall
a
confusing
brew
nice
taste
but
can
think
of
so
many
other
better
strong
alesand
or
chocolatecocoa
brews
i
prefer
wont
buy
again
cheers
overall
dogfish
is
easily
one
of
my
personal
favorite
breweries
and
the
ancient
ales
series
is
a
really
interesting
idea
so
as
a
result
i
was
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
expected
a
lot
and
had
been
putting
off
trying
it
for
some
time
while
it
wallowed
in
my
fridge
perhaps
i
built
it
up
too
much
be
that
as
it
may
it
is
an
above
average
beer
the
chili
aspect
is
superbly
done
and
the
chocolate
is
not
cloying
by
any
means
all
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
just
too
muted
subtlety
is
nice
when
dealing
with
strong
flavors
such
as
chili
and
chocolate
but
it
can
be
taken
too
far
this
beer
is
an
example
of
where
a
little
more
bravado
would
have
been
welcomed
perhaps
a
crazy
brewer
like
three
floyds
brew
dog
cigar
city
or
mikkeller
could
have
taken
this
idea
further
by
putting
everything
over
the
top
perhaps
southern
tier
could
have
emulated
this
ancient
style
better
with
their
impossibly
accurate
imitations
whatever
the
case
this
is
a
beer
to
try
if
you
are
into
the
style
chocolatechili
beer
or
into
dogfish
head
or
into
more
specifically
their
ancient
ales
series
otherwise
do
not
waste
the
money
on
this
one
14

overall
these
ancient
ales
are
hit
or
miss
but
i
think
dogfish
pulled
it
off
on
this
one
its
a
grower
though
dont
expect
theobroma
to
blow
you
away
let
it
appreciate
o
decent
beer
not
gonna
get
it
again
though
o
recommend
sharing
unless
you
like
heat
because
this
brings
it
more
than
a
stone
offering
for
example
always
like
to
try
out
whatever
new
idea
dogfish
head
is
offering
tastes
like
straight
natural
cacao
sweet
chcoloate
but
not
roasty
thick
and
luscious
great
beer
really
enjoyed
this
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
a
chile
beer
but
its
my
first
time
trying
it
plus
its
dogfish
so
you
know
it
wasnt
brewed
to
standards
good
beer
but
something
ya
gotta
share
its
a
stomach
ache
waiting
to
happen
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
its
a
different
flavor
and
so
its
interesting
but
i
dont
love
it
its
worth
drinking
and
id
drink
it
again
o
this
beer
is
pretty
much
exactly
as
described
pretty
much
pure
chocolate
and
chile
heat
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
perhaps
that
annatto
in
the
finish
dont
be
expecting
a
big
roasty
chocolately
porter
or
stout
the
chocolate
isnt
that
big
its
some
nice
cocoa
thats
balanced
with
the
chile
no
real
vegetal
pepper
flavors
either
just
the
spicy
flavor
and
heat
definitely
a
must
try
if
you
like
chocolatechili
beers
this
is
one
of
the
best
o
nice
treat
very
balanced
much
like
a
mole
sauce
though
its
components
are
a
little
more
discernable
while
i
drank
it
on
its
own
it
would
probably
be
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
fullbold
cheese
bbq
or
spicy
dish
i
would
love
to
drink
this
with
regularity
if
not
for
a
hefty
price

i

must
have
again
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
which
changes
quite
a
bit
as
it
is
enjoyed
one
of
the
better
ones
of
the
series
overall
this
is
the
best
chile
beer
ive
had
to
date
it
is
complex
interesting
and
profoundly
delicious
as
im
not
real
familiar
with
this
particular
style
my
rating
is
mainly
based
on
my
personal
experience
with
the
brew
during
my
visit
at
the
brewpub
last
night
o
i
love
beers
like
this
and
dfh
seems
to
be
the
master
their
ancient
ales
line
is
brilliant
and
this
beer
is
excellent
really
interesting
to
get
such
a
distinct
cocoa
taste
in
a
pale
ale
categorized
as
a
chile
beer
weird
but
what
else
are
you
gonna
do
with
a
brew
as
wonderfully
unique
as
this
other
than
buy
it
and
drink
it
another
fascinating
little
brew
from
dogfish
head
i
love
how
blatant
the
chilies
become
in
the
mouth
and
throat
still
too
leaning
on
fruity
belgian
yeast
strains
works
just
fine
for
me
the
spicelover
onot
a
heavy
hitter
like
other
dfh
beers
surprised
how
subtle
the
flavors
are
considering
how
the
main
ingredients
have
such
strong
flavors
on
their
own
ooverall
an
interesting
blend
of
flavors
but
would
have
like
to
see
more
of
a
chile
presence
here
to
balance
the
cocoa
and
honey
more
overall
id
try
this
again
as
i
mentioned
there
was
nothing
spectacular
here
no
wow
factor
but
it
was
pleasing
i
tried
this
on
my
porch
one
august
with
a
frienddrank
it
swig
for
swig
out
of
the
bottle
medium
carbonation
nice
mouthfeel
the
chocolate
is
definetly
apparent
along
with
the
spice
i
loved
it
i
got
it
in
a
growler
some
time
later
and
it
was
cold
i
wouldnt
reccomend
drinking
it
cold
due
to
the
fact
that
the
taste
went
from
sweet
and
complex
to
sweet
tasty
yet
the
flavor
did
not
come
through
as
well
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
most
and
to
me
had
the
best
concept
of
any
of
the
chili
beers
that
night
the
combination
of
honey
and
heat
is
very
complimentary
and
makes
for
a
pretty
unique
beer
o
ill
bet
this
is
better
fresh
itd
have
to
be
as
its
just
ok
now
about
eighteen
months
or
so
in
the
bottle
not
enough
heat
yet
not
easy
drinking
enough
to
put
back
more
then
a
few
ounces
at
a
time
decent
yet
underwhelming
drinkability
a
funny
tasting
beer
to
me
i
couldnt
taste
any
of
the
cocoa
and
there
was
a
bitterness
i
didnt
care
much
for
in
spite
of
the
honey
the
quality
and
the
craftsmanship
in
all
the
dfh
beers
are
evident
and
they
remain
true
here
i
did
not
particularly
enjoy
the
aroma
but
the
beer
promised
everything
that
was
on
the
label
and
highlights
honey
without
just
being
a
plain
mead
chiles
and
cocoa
are
a
nice
match
really
had
to
concentrate
to
get
all
the
complexities
out
of
this
one
but
well
worth
it
overall
aside
for
lack
of
aroma
this
beer
is
on
the
border
of
greatness
has
almost
everything
granted
when
you
think
about
who
gives
a
fck
when
it
comes
to
smelling
taste
alone
beer
wins
it
all
salud
o
an
occasional
indulgence
not
something
id
drink
often
but
both
an
innovative
idea
and
respectable
brew
overall
im
not
one
to
exclaim
exaggerations
about
beer
i
usually
tell
it
like
it
is
and
ive
got
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
encountered
its
just
so
seamless
and
exciting
while
retaining
a
historical
blueprint
its
like
discovering
the
past
but
in
a
tactile
way
dfh
youve
really
outdid
yourself
this
time
i
applaud
you
on
this
offcentered
but
wholly
grounded
beer
thank
you
overall
its
very
good
only
my
second
chile
beer
ever
and
this
is
something
great
for
a
change
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
smooth
and
i
really
like
the
honey
flavor
it
is
a
little
bit
of
a
sipper
but
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
glasses
overall
i
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
i
found
it
to
be
quite
interesting
i
recommend
trying
it
out
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
worth
a
go
but
not
to
stock
up
on
overall
didnt
get
much
in
the
way
of
chilles
or
cocoa
it
was
okay
m
an
intriguing
ale
the
chocolate
chiles
and
honey
sweetness
come
together
nicely
and
stand
just
as
easily
on
their
own
inventive
but
drinkable
and
exotic
the
small
sips
are
awesome
and
a
must
o
this
is
a
great
beer
no
doubt
a
lot
of
people
think
dogfish
head
gimmicky
but
im
glad
someone
is
brewing
this
this
is
very
drinkable
with
good
balance
and
its
going
well
with
my
home
made
chocolate
chip
cookies
id
say
sam
crank
up
the
nibs
the
flavor
is
awfully
mild
and
there
isnt
much
going
on
the
peppers
are
hardly
there
and
overall
flavor
lacks
dimensions
too
bad
as
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
o
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
one
the
ingredients
sounded
so
inticing
and
i
wxpected
them
to
stand
out
more
than
they
did
as
much
as
i
love
the
ingenuity
here
it
falls
a
little
short
for
me
medium
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
along
with
earthy
hops
light
cocoa
a
sweet
eastern
smelling
spice
annatto
and
a
light
toastiness
cocoa
is
very
subtle
in
the
taste
and
reminds
me
more
of
the
powder
than
the
nibs
and
i
find
it
best
after
i
take
a
sip
and
breathe
out
very
quickly
also
in
the
taste
is
some
belgian
yeastiness
and
a
dry
mediumhot
alcohol
that
i
associate
with
brewing
with
honey
since
it
ferments
so
completely
speaking
of
dry
a
little
dry
on
the
palate
but
overall
a
fine
experimental
brew
though
i
can
see
why
it
may
be
too
subtle
for
some
especially
at
915
bottle
depending
where
you
shopavailablity
verdict
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
but
a
bit
lacking
when
it
comes
to
the
special
ingredients
interestingly
enough
i
found
the
grain
elements
to
most
enjoyable
certainly
an
enjoyable
brew
but
probably
not
one
id
buy
again
i
recommend
having
something
to
drink
for
your
throat
every
so
often
without
that
my
throat
got
a
little
itchy
this
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
hue
with
a
slight
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
i
might
be
a
little
stuffed
up
but
there
is
almost
no
smell
to
this
beverage
a
slight
malt
presence
at
the
front
with
a
nice
honey
finish
pretty
disappointed
in
this
one
just
based
on
the
description
from
the
bottle
you
would
never
know
that
there
was
any
form
of
cocoa
let
alone
2
or
chilies
glad
these
guys
continue
to
push
the
boundaries
but
kind
of
missed
on
this
one
overall
i
found
this
to
be
my
least
favorite
of
the
ancient
ales
so
far
it
kind
of
seems
like
dfh
was
trying
to
either
play
this
one
safe
or
make
it
different
than
people
would
expect
but
it
just
turned
out
to
be
pretty
boring
like
most
of
the
ancient
ales
theobroma
has
a
cool
origin
story
unlike
the
others
this
one
carries
a
consistently
mediocre
rating
i
dont
think
its
as
bad
as
some
but
its
definitely
not
as
complex
as
the
myriad
ingredients
would
suggest
d
unique
thats
for
sure
the
mix
of
the
darker
chocolate
flavors
and
peppers
are
interesting
and
something
i
might
wanna
try
in
a
more
fullbodied
malt
based
beer
worth
a
shot
but
may
not
be
something
you
want
to
visit
often
very
crisp
beer
really
enjoyed
it
looking
forward
to
tasting
more
of
these
rare
or
ancient
beers
from
the
good
people
at
dogfish
head
overall
sometimes
with
all
the
funky
ingredients
all
sams
ancient
ales
begin
to
taste
alike
i
think
of
it
more
as
a
series
of
variations
on
one

this

of
their
ancient

there
is
a

it
is

very
interesting
beer
that
has
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
i
was
a
bit
worried
at
first
when
reading
the
label
and
seeing
things
like
chocolate
though
i
wouldnt
want
it
more
than
once
or
twice
a
year
thebreederswowdec

etc
boring
just
because
they
arent
huge
and
extreme
this
is
the
other
end
of
that
spectrum
a
giant
beer
incorporating
a
ton
of
crazy
ingredients
that
is
so
dull
and
lifeless
it
ends
up
being
though
paired
well
with
some
food
from
the
grill
that
accompanied
this
beer
at
one
point
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
years
and
while
im
a
huge
dfh
fan
this
one
misses
the
mark
but

was
really

to
try

based
on
the
describtion
by
far
the
least
flavorful
beer
from
dfh
ive
had
unless
the
recipe
changes
to
add
a

more
flavor
this
is
an
extremely
well
made
beer
and
while
its
not
necessarily
my
taste
it
is

not
drinkable
couldnt
drink
a
whole
bomber
myself
wouldnt
get
this
again
unless
i
was
introducing
someone
to
chili
beer
jmerloninov
27
fruits
and
easy
drinking
mead
after
several
sips
i
had
a
hard
time
detecting
any
chocolate
i
walked
away
for
a
minute
and
low
and
behold
like
their
midas
touch
the
wine
aspect
of
this
beer
is
hard
to
ignore
especially
in
this
case
where
we
were
overtly
promised
chocolate
and
chilies
a
tasty
affair
to
be
sure
but
the
chili
spice
is
just
a
little
too
reserved
and
the
poor
mans
saffron
probably
just
gets
lost
in
the
fray
d
this
is
a
different
breed
for
me
i
had
never
had
a
chile
beer
but
i
was
expecting
something
so
much
different
i
wonder
if
it
alter
my
perception
of
it
i
want
to
try
it
again
but
it
is
expensive
at
18
99bottle
when
it
can
be
found
around
my
parts
had
bomber
dated
from
2009
that
i
had
cellaring
in
the
wine
cooler
for
1
yr
opened
and
was
hit
with
an
awsome
aroma
of
honey
and
spice
while
pouring
could
see
some
hints
of
sediment
from
age
and
the
color
had
changed
from
fresher
batches
that
ive
had
throughout
the
year
the
amber
color
had
turned
a
beautiful
orange
and
upon
tasting
was
hit
with
awsome
honey
and
coco
flavor
i
was
dissapointed
with
the
chile
which
didnt
come
through
i
just
seemed
to
want
more
and
more
and
it
was
not
dry
all
overall
and
awsome
expirience
with
age
well
worth
the
wait
first
i
have
to
admit
that
i
always
enjoy
trying
an
historic
or
archeological
beer
i
really
like
the
experience
and
unique
flavors
this
beer
is
a
golden
mostly
clear
liquid
theres
some
carbonation
but
no
head
actually
from
a
distance
it
looks
like
a
mead
it
certainly
doesnt
smell
like
one
it
has
a
strange
aroma
thats
not
at
all
beerlike
it
has
the
scent
of
grape
juice
not
sure
where
that
comes
from
spice
background
honey
and
alcohol
earthy
and
spicy
the
intent
seems
to
be
to
showcase
cocoa
but
i
didnt
initially
get
it
however
after
trying
some
unsweetened
baking
cocoa
for
reference
the
cocoa
character
is
completely
obvious
its
present
in
every
sip
and
is
really
very
pleasant
well
done
the
chilies
seem
to
take
the
place
of
hops
and
give
the
beer
slightly
warm
finish
and
an
apparent
dryness
still
its
a
strange
set
of
flavors
and
although
its
good
i
cant
call
it
incredibly
drinkable
a
great
experiment
though
d
well
this
is
a
long
leap
from
what
i
expected
oddly
it
shared
more
qualities
with
d
h
midas
touch
and
orange
blossom
pilsner
than
anything
else
it
is
meadlike
in
sweetness
and
the
chillies
dont
really
leave
a
big
impression
let
me
end
this
on
a
good
note
the
more
you
drink
it
the
more
noticeable
the
cocoa
becomes
though
it
is
quite
subtle
d
this
is
a
really
beautifully
crafted
beer
all
flavors
are
subtle
but
appreciable
gold
with
a
fizzy
pour
and
a
light
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
of
slightly
soured
fruits
and
honey
with
a
mild
malty
base
tastes
sweet
sour
and
spicy
with
a
good
hit
of
alcohol
at
the
end
and
an
undercurrent
of
chiles
a
light
fruitiness
exists
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
somewhat
creamy
goes
down
fairly
smooth
despite
the
lingering
alcohol
heat
good
beer
that
i
would
rather
have
had
in
a
12
oz
pour
not
for
sure
im
so
stoked
on
it
that
i
can
appreciate
an
entire
bomber
d
interesting
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
impressive
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
simply
not
my
style
i
respect
that
dfh
stretches
and
does
this
ancient
recreations
but
this
one
didnt
do
much
for
me
worth
trying
just
to
see
what
it
was
like
long
ago
but
would
rather
do
it
from
a
sample
instead
of
a
whole
bottle
avail
here
in
tx
rotation
good
but
one
is
enough
nn
poured
this
into
a
tulip
the
body
is
a
deep
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
little
floaty
things
kicking
around
and
just
a
thin
layer
of
white
head
on
top
the
aroma
releases
a
big
whiff
of
honey
right
away
underneath
i
smell
sweet
fruit
and
just
a
little
bit
of
cocoa
im
really
not
detecting
any
chili
at
all
which
seems
a
bit
off
the
flavor
is
thick
and
malty
with
honey
sweetness
coating
the
tongue
to
begin
and
just
a
touch
of
chili
in
the
finish
for
a
little
after
burn
that
is
only
enough
to
really
know
that
it
is
there
ever
so
slight
hints
of
dry
cocoa
are
present
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
bordering
syrupy
with
really
nice
carbonation
enjoyable
drinkability
even
at
a
pretty
well
hidden
nine
percent
overall
its
very
unique
but
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
however
as
with
most
dfh
beers
it
was
nice
to
try
but
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
on
a
regular
basis
i
have
had
this
many
times
and
it
is
not
something
i
would
recommend
at
all
very
bland
and
generic
dogfish
head
does
some
interesting
stuff
from
time
to
time
sometimes
it
is
really
good
sometimes
it
is
average
and
sometimes
it
is
just
bad
this
is
just
bad
imo
thanks
matt
for
hooking
me
up
d
very
drinkable
balanced
and
the
chili
element
is
not
threatening
at
all
wish
i
was
enjoying
this
with
a
nice
meal
because
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
even
more
the
first
chile
beer
ive
ever
had
and
the
spiciness
is
certainly
interesting
overall
a
nice
beer
to
try
but
not
something
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
also
despite
the
fact
that
its
9
abv
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
and
thus
could
easily
sneak
up
on
you
the
flavor
is
a
180degree
turn
from
the
aroma
as
a
syrupy
stinging
spicy
sweetness
greets
the
palate
tangy
is
a
good
descriptor
but
overall
theres
just
too
much
going
on
in
this
beer
the
chili
cocoa
are
overcome
by
a
hefty
green
booze
note
and
mineral
graininess
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
making
the
thick
body
schizophrenic
in
its
consistency
theobroma
is
certainly
unique
but
in
the
end
it
drinks
like
a
poorlycrafted
cloyingly
sweet
belgian
strong
ale
whose
spices
arent
derived
from
the
yeast
not
worth
the
price
tag
and
not
worth
a
revisit
from
yours
truly
drinkability
good
i
agree
with
the
previous
reviewer
i
think
this
would
pair
perfectly
with
a
good
pad
thai
really
a
must
try
just
for
the
unique
nature
of
the
brew
while
its
obvious
this
is
a
high
quality
and
well
crafted
brew
it
simply
didnt
do
much
for
my
palate
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
to
try
but
i
dont
see
myself
having
it
again
drinkability
very
good
if
it
werent
nearly
15
per
fifth
id
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
especially
with
real
thai
or
mexican
food
pretty
awesome
beer
drinkability
exceedingly
easy
to
drink
and
overall
very
enjoyable
experiance
hard
to
explain
and
hard
for
me
to
describe
but
at
no
point
did
i
feel
like
i
was
drink
at
9
percent
beer
at
all
worth
seeking
out
to
see
what
you
think
this
is
one
that
surely
grew
on
me
as
i
went
more
and
more
initially
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
historic
brew
it
was
a
major
letdown
nothing
really
unique
about
the
taste
complete
waste
of
time
and
money
in
my
opinion
drinkability
750
is
just
about
enough
for
me
its
a
good
beer
and
all
but
more
than
a
bottle
and
it
will
most
likely
knock
you
on
your
ass
its
a
drinkable
archeological
recreation
for
sure
but
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
tripel
or
belgian
golden
strong
with
a
few
twists
in
fact
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
stronger
spiced
version
of
midas
touch
interesting
to
try
once
but
not
enough
there
to
bring
me
back
for
more
verdict
theobroma
is
an
interesting
solid
and
highly
drinkable
little
experiment
of
the
dogfish
head
historical
recreations
this
was
the
one
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
most
but
it
ended
up
being
my
least
favorite
funny
how
things
work
out
like
that
its
fairly
drinkable
very
unique
flavor
its
worth
checking
it
out
i
suppose
it
wasnt
bad
per
se
but
for
all
the
ingredients
and
expense
its
really
no
more
exciting
or
rewarding
than
a
supermarket
witbier
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
one
and
done
with
this
pretty
cool
beer
i
love
their
experimental
beers
like
this
throughly
enjoyed
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
at
all
and
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
brewery
so
take
that
in
to
consideration
but
as
someone
mentioned
and
i
may
have
to
agree
with
them
this
is
the
worst
product
they
have
ever
made
that
i
have
ever
had
by
df
taste
was
complex
first
noticed
sour
fruit
finnishing
with
bitter
spice
then
the
chocolate
notes
came
through
covering
the
palate
with
a
silky
savory
feeling
backed
by
spice
from
the
chiles
and
finnishing
with
a
sweet
and
sour
fruit
taste
reminiscent
of
starfruit
a
good
interesting
beer
i
had
long
awaited
the
arrival
of
this
beer
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
the
concept
of
chili
peppers
and
chocolate
not
to
mention
the
reviews
i
had
seen
of
it
sounded
amazing
i
am
sad
to
say
that
i
was
not
impressed
by
the
balance
of
the
flavors
at
all
i
didnt
find
that
there
was
any
flavor
of
the
chili
peppers
in
the
beer
at
all
ideally
i
would
have
liked
a
little
spice
or
something
to
be
there
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
the
chocolate
going
in
but
i
got
nothing
although
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
learned
from
the
experience
i
felt
a
bit
let
down
by
it
d
not
a
fan
of
this
one
seems
like
it
doesnt
know
what
the
hell
it
wants
to
be
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
has
a
smooth
texture
to
it
it
is
very
complex
but
goes
down
easy
with
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
like
most
dogfish
head
beers
this
is
really
a
great
experience
duh
good
i
guess
once
again
dogfish
head
has
made
a
good
beer
but
what
kind
of
beer
i
have
no
clue
all
in
all
this
is
a
an
ok
brew
nothing
special
dont
make
this
your
first
try
d
hmmmm
im
not
sure
how
to
feel
about
this
one
its
not
bad
but
im
not
sure
id
ever
need
to
drink
it
again
above
average
as
a
beer
but
its
hard
for
me
to
rate
this
one
to
style
personally
we
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
heat
from
those
chilies
but
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
more
interesting
tasty
and
experimental
brews
from
dogfish
head
the
balance
of
flavors
from
so
many
distinct
sources
is
pretty
much
perfect
sam
please
make
more
it
has
a
nice
smell
to
it
of
unsweetened
chocolate
and
earth
like
smells
which
are
probably
the
annatto
seeds
they
put
in
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
that
nice
unsweetened
chocolate
taste
with
that
pleasing
annatto
seed
taste
it
also
is
extremely
smooth
and
has
a
nice
burning
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
throat
from
the
ancho
chilies
which
by
the
way
makes
the
beer
in
my
opinion
doesnt
even
taste
like
9
percent
either
although
you
can
feel
it
i
liked
this
one
a
little
bit
better
than
their
sahtea
that
ive
tried
only
a
month
or
two
earlier
not
even
dogfish
head
does
it
again
though
thanks
guys
not
quite
stellar
but
this
is
much
better
than
the
consensus
b
it
has
at
this
point
overall
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
want
todrink
often
when
i
try
a
beer
that
it
brewed
with
honey
cacoa
and
chiles
i
expect
it
to
taste
like
honey
cacoa
and
chiles
all
three
of
these
elements
were
hardly
noticeable
in
this
beer
i
appreciate
the
efforts
of
dogfish
head
in
recreating
an
authentic
mayanaztec
drink
unfortunately
this
recipe
did
not
translate
well
into
a
modern
day
brew
good
beer
and
once
again
i
am
extremely
excited
by
dogfish
heads
ancient
ales
a
good
bottle
to
split
especially
if
you
wanted
to
try
something
pretty
out
of
the
ordinary
with
a
lot
of
south
and
central
american
flavors
mayan
royal
drink
of
the
gods
i
doubt
it
but
it
certainly
is
a
very
nice
endoftheweek
relaxer
for
a
hardworking
lowermiddleclass
peon
my
theobroma
poured
with
a
orange
colour
a
1
cm
head
and
decent
lacing
nice
earthy
chocolate
smell
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
the
cocoa
is
immediately
apparent
and
tastes
good
then
it
fades
into
a
slightly
muddy
aftertaste
still
a
really
nice
and
unusual
beer
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
but
there
are
many
better
choices
from
dfh
120
min

wws
bithces
brew
fort
etc
d
decent
drinkability
but
starts
to
wear
on
me
towards
the
end
of
the
bomber
this
is
a
beer
that
is
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
far
from
my
favorite
dfh
offering
im
glad
ive
tried
it
though
and
recommend
the
unique
experience
to
anyone
d
it
drank
very
good
but
i
have
to
say
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
coming
fron
dfh
i
honestly
think
it
was
better
the
first
time
around
dogfish
head
is
still
my
favourite
brewery
for
now
but
i
hope
this
is
not
the
direction
new
brews
from
dfh
take
good
mouthfeel
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
but
i
think
this
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
thicker
a
nice
sipper
even
at
9
d
hands
down
this
is
a
great
beer
not
my
personal
favorite
but
a
damn
you
good
beer
that
really
grows
on
you
it
has
such
a
strange
and
wonderful
combination
of
flavors
that
you
can
not
help
but
like
it
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
stormy
day
to
give
you
a
warm
cozy
feeling
inside
everyone
needs
to
try
this
beer
and
taste
a
piece
of
history
with
some
food
for
the
gods
pours
an
almostclear
ambergolden
color
with
some
sediment
floating
around
in
it
the
head
is
medium
sized
and
dissolves
quickly
smell
is
very
sweet
with
some
very
noticeable
alcohol
sweet
fruits
along
with
some
zesty
spices
i
also
get
a
slight
medicinelike
smell
which
is
kinda
a
turnoff
taste
is
very
interesting
immediately
i
get
a
boozy
taste
once
sipping
it
at
9
i
wasnt
expecting
this
much
heat
i
also
pick
up
some
fruits
apple
pear
grapes
i
get
quite
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
as
well
the
alcohol
flavor
is
a
bit
overwhelming
takes
away
from
the
other
flavors
this
is
my
first
chile
beer
but
im
not
tasting
any
chilies
so
im
a
bit
confused
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
but
drinkability
isnt
so
high
overall
its
very
interesting
cant
say
its
fantastic
but
it
has
its
highs
and
lows
all
in
one
bottle
wouldnt
buy
again
though
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
very
good
i
didnt
even
realize
it
was
a
chile
beer
until
i
looked
for
it
tonight
i
didnt
even
think
of
a
chile
beer
when
i
tried
it
drinkability
despite
everything
else
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
i
will
have
no
problems
getting
through
the
750
the
flavors
mix
well
to
make
something
that
isnt
incredible
but
is
enjoyable
this
is
not
an
every
day
beer
but
yet
another
for
special
occasions
i
should
note
that
my
girlfriend
who
loves
spicy
food
had
a
glass
of
this
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
complaining
of
a
stomach
ache
because
the
combination
of
the
peppers
chocolate
and
alcohol
didnt
mix
well
in
her
system
but
i
felt
fine
i
wouldnt
drink
this
on
an
empty
stomach
if
youre
sensitive
to
peppers
d
i
suppose
im
glad
this
beer
wasnt
horrendously
bad
like
it
certainly
could
have
been
but
it
wasnt
really
any
good
either
d
although
it
is
very
drinkable
i
cant
say
that
i
would
rush
for
another
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
and
appreciate
the
attempt
but
honestly
not
all
that
impressed
this
beer
lets
you
know
there
is
a
lot
going
on
light
malt
and
biscuit
flavors
with
a
good
honey
presence
a
dark
alkaline
chocolate
flavor
comes
through
from
the
cocoa
nibs
along
with
the
same
chocolate
bitterness
the
chile
heat
sneaks
in
the
back
but
warms
rather
than
burns
the
light
carbonation
and
body
kept
this
easy
drinking
throughout
and
it
was
a
very
refreshing
session
that
got
more
complex
as
it
warmed
up
id
like
this
again
and
was
glad
to
have
had
it
a
final
note
i
respect
and
embrace
the
philosophy
behind
this
entire
series
of
recreating
ancient
recipes
therefore
i
try
each
one
well
knowing
that
it
is
not
a
modern
day
version
of
beer
and
so
anything
might
happen
it
is
in
that
spirit
that
i
will
continue
to
try
the
next
in
the
series
when
it
comes
out
this
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
offering
ive
sampled
from
dfh
though
i
have
yet
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
the
midas
touch
and
based
on
the
concept
of
it
i
wonder
how
the
two
would
stack
up
against
one
another
i
really
appreciate
it
being
an
interesting
brew
and
id
like
to
adjust
my
ratings
but
then
itd
skew
it
against
current
modern
offerings
i
dont
think
its
a
chile
beer
but
i
guess
there
isnt
really
a
category
for
it
its
cool
like
midas
touch
but
not
something
id
normally
have
d
only
1
per
sitting
for
me
not
a
session
beer
id
say
that
the
untraditional
aspects
of
this
beer
will
be
hard
to
take
for
most
i
understand
brewer
intention
and
innovation
but
i
still
think
this
is
too
focused
on
one
ingredient
to
truly
reflect
the
original
nature
of
this
beer
it
would
be
much
easier
to
take
in
a
12
oz
bottle
but
at
750
ml
its
hard
to
choke
down
750
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
this
is
a
clear
golden
amber
color
very
fizzy
with
a
light
to
moderate
head
smell
includes
chocolate
cinnamon
maple
and
chili
peppers
taste
is
a
mix
of
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
slight
peppery
kick
at
the
end
fairly
tasty
but
not
nearly
as
complex
as
the
description
suggested
drinkability
is
excellent
for
nearing
10
abv
i
was
expecting
another
typical
dogfish
head
novelty
beer
but
this
one
holds
up
very
well
with
its
own
unique
style
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
serious
beerologist
d
decent
yet
it
seems
like
this
is
missing
something
good
to
try
once
but
repeat
attempts
arent
really
necessary
since
its
kind
of
one
dimensional
d
although
the
alcohol
is
masked
rather
well
from
the
taste
this
beer
still
tastes
strong
and
is
one
that
needs
to
be
sipped
given
its
amount
of
cloying
sweetness
d
fairly
easy
to
put
down
but
this
is
more
of
a
beer
you
would
want
to
try
once
this
one
isnt
really
worth
purchasing
again
in
my
opinion

this

aint
bad
that
perfumy

slows
it
up

mixes
with

interesting

odd

not

not
what

who

what

its

stuff
kinda

ok

i

that
dfh
once

has
pulled

55the
drinkability
of
this
one
is
excellent
i
could
have
easily
and
gladly
finished
a
whole
750
by
myself
not
to
say
explosion
is
always
good
either
at
least
not
your
first
bottle
more
than
likely
and
a
really
cool
idea
by
dfh
this
is
definitely
something
that
every
beer
geek
should
try
pick
it
up
number1bumdec

but
not
over
carbonated
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
would
suggest
sweet
brews
the
taste
is
solid
the
concept
of
this
beer
is
very
interesting
and
it
does
get
some
points
for
being
original
it
is
definitely
a
beer
that
is
worth
trying
for
its
uniqueness

i
thought
the
chocolate
and
chilies
flavor
would
be
stronger
but
with
that
being
said
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
hazy
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
offwhite
head
with
minimal
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
some
chilis
coco
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
nice
touch
of
chilis
medium
body
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
the
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
quite
different
to
say
the
least
thanks
tim
drinkability
is
low
to
moderate
really
interesting
flavors
indeed
im
never
a
huge
fan
of
their
archaeological
beers
but
i
like
the
idea
of
doing
them
which
goes
a
long
way
for
me
i
do
think
it
will
be
rather
difficult
to
finish
this
champaign
bottle
by
myself
though
and
really
wished
i
had
waited
to
share
this
with
a
few
friends
even
a
12
oz
pour
may
prove
to
be
a
difficult
feat
boring
along
with
the
usual
dfh
specialty
pricetag
would
probably
keep
me
from
having
this
again
d
more
than
interesting
very
flavorful
i
liked
it
one
atatime
anyway
quite
a
good
beer
another
job
well
done
for
dfh
nicely
done
sweet
simple
aromas
of
honey
and
cocoa
taste
is
malty
with
a
detectable
but
fleeting
nuance
of
ancho
on
the
backend
not
spicy
as
one
might
think
from
the
description
on
the
label
midas
touchs
doppelganger
good
but
not
worth
the
hype
of
a
750ml
bottle
light
golden
colored
ale
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
of
cream
nose
isnt
lacking
in
its
vibrancy
but
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
complexity
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
a
honeyed
fruit
character
meadlike
not
a
complex
beer
but
interesting
and
pleasant
tasting
easily
one
of
the
more
bizarre
things
dfh
has
done
poured
up
a
cloudy
medium
orange
colour
with
a
white
head
appearance
was
about
average
being
neither
particularly
attractive
nor
offputting
smelled
to
me
like
white
grapes
and
bread
dough
a
strange
combination
for
sure
but
truthfully
i
struggle
to
find
those
aroma
profiles
and
really
there
isnt
much
here
in
the
way
of
smell
there
is
certainly
some
sweet
malt
present
but
this
is
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
had
before
as
far
as
the
smell
is
concerned
the
taste
is
rather
strange
too
i
cant
really
discern
any
of
the
honey
cocoa
chile
peppers
or
any
other
flavours
its
pretty
sweet
up
front
but
i
dont
really
think
its
from
the
honey
then
the
finish
kinda
reminds
me
of
midas
touch
but
with
the
slightest
hint
of
smoke
i
really
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
it
doesnt
taste
bad
i
can
drink
it
and
will
have
no
trouble
killing
a
750ml
by
myself
as
the
alcohol
is
wonderfully
concealed
however
it
isnt
really
something
i
would
seek
out
again
midas
touch
comes
to
mind
a
very
very
unusual
beer
for
sure
i
have
a
feeling
this
would
go
well
with
a
good
beef
stew
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
almost
amber
thin
white
head
forms
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
no
real
lacing
ring
sticks
around
though
smell
is
interesting
very
malty
bread
honey
sweetness
biscuit
vegetables
bit
of
chile
aroma
a
bit
peppery
interesting
taste
is
very
sweet
and
very
fruity
honey
corny
honey
and
caramel
grapes
chile
more
peppery
heat
than
spice
lingers
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
some
warmth
from
alcohol
very
peppery
spice
finish
not
sure
where
the
cocoa
comes
into
play
as
i
dont
get
any
in
either
the
aroma
or
flavour
neat
experiment
the
chile
came
through
nice
but
otherwise
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
drinkability
is
nice
the
heat
doesnt
overpower
this
one
didnt
really
wow
me
but
i
enjoyed
it
d
totally
different
than
i
had
expected
the
presence
of
cocoa
or
chiles
in
this
beer
is
substantially
muted
if
noticeable
at
all
still
this
one
is
tasty
and
drinks
nicely
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
9
abv
is
hidden
extremely
well
and
despite
the
fact
that
i
cannot
taste
any
hops
in
this
beer
or
really
even
feel
them
as
in
bittering
this
beer
is
extremely
well
balanced
the
chili
gives
some
spiciness
in
flavor
and
feel
the
feel
of
dry
powder
on
the
tongue
impossible
feel
to
describe
but
its
hinted
at
in
this
beer
the
cocoa
gives
some
dy
character
and
some
perceived
bitterness
as
it
sits
along
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
roof
of
the
mouth
and
the
honey
provides
sweetness
finish
is
semidry
body
is
medium
some
weight
added
by
the
honey
carbonation
is
perfect
playing
off
the
honey
so
well
this
is
one
that
is
dangerously
drinkable
if
you
like
midas
touch
or
if
you
like
mead
i
guarantee
youll
like
this
one
as
well
alcohol
is
well
hidden
medium
body
with
an
almost
creamy
feel
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
the
cocoa
and
chili
is
not
as
pronounced
as
i
expected
but
still
worth
a
try
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
pour
into
the
ever
trusty
duvel
tulip
is
a
very
clear
light
amber
much
lighter
than
expected
about
a
finger
of
white
head
quickly
recedes
leaving
slight
lacing
it
all
clears
up
very
quickly
still
waters
here
smell
is
a
bit
of
honey
some
nouget
toblerone
chocolates
come
to
mind
no
chili
pepper
presence
sadly
this
is
true
in
the
taste
as
well
another
overly
sweet
high
alcohol
dfh
beer
taste
is
fine
sweet
killing
this
bottle
will
not
be
a
problem
but
tastes
are
nothing
like
what
i
was
anticipating
little
to
no
cocoa
presence
and
absolutely
no
chili
thankfully
the
auslese
tastes
and
aromas
predominent
in
their
other
archeological
creations
do
not
register
here
mouthfeel
is
fairly
watery
and
smooth
with
little
to
no
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
with
no
noticeable
heat
for
its
abv
all
in
all
a
nice
enough
experience
but
a
letdown
and
not
a
repeat
purchase
recommended
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sweeter
beers
but
not
if
you
are
expecting
anything
with
a
strong
chocolate
presence
or
chili
heat
pours
with
a
three
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
traces
lace
clear
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
body
sweet
spicy
nose
flavor
is
a
sweet
smooth
some
cocoa
honey
but
cant
taste
the
chilies
the
early
hondurans
1200bc
had
something
going
here
worth
trying
even
at
12
00
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
i
gave
the
beer
a
5
for
drinkability
not
a
real
word
in
the
sense
that
it
is
able
to
be
drunk
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
nice
orangestraw
color
the
foamlacing
quick
to
disappear
the
smell
was
more
of
what
id
call
a
midgrade
lager
smell
kind
of
wethay
barn
smell
i
could
not
detect
the
chilis
or
the
chocolate
in
the
smell
early
tastes
were
more
of
the
lagerbarn
variety
which
disappointed
me
i
thought
of
all
the
maltbackbone
flavors
to
pair
exotic
chocolate
and
chili
with
this
didnt
seem
to
be
the
one
as
i
worked
through
more
it
began
to
open
up
and
be
more
balanced
the
maltiness
holding
the
chilichocolate
in
check
i
began
appreciating
the
uniqueness
of
the
beer
but
still
not
really
enjoying
it
the
mouthfeel
was
not
great
kind
of
a
heavy
lager
feel
to
it
the
drinkability
was
not
great
due
to
many
of
the
factors
above
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
not
too
hot
bitter
or
stringent
but
still
the
overall
viscosity
and
heavy
lagerlike
i
know
its
not
a
lager
flavor
just
made
it
more
of
a
chore
to
work
through
it
interesting
but
not
special
enough
for
the
price
additional
notes
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
chocolate
beer
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
d
really
easy
to
drink
its
so
complex
that
you
want
to
savor
it
and
explore
its
flavors
not
too
heavy
but
so
complex
and
wonderful
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
one
still
glad
i
tried
it
though
again
not
at
all
what
i
expected
certainly
interesting
but
not
nearly
as
exotic
as
i
would
have
guessed
from
the
description
a
tasty
beer
and
one
im
glad
i
tried
but
not
quite
unique
enough
to
seek
out
certainly
a
good
one
to
share
interestingly
sweet
and
flavorful
very
drinkable
as
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
sip
on
im
a
big
fan
of
the
concept
behind
these
archeological
beers
from
dfh
but
im
kinda
a
geek
that
way
this
one
is
vaery
interesting
and
quite
succesful
from
a
beer
point
of
view
as
well
pours
a
lighter
shade
of
orange
with
a
short
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
swirl
the
smell
is
fairly
light
but
i
smell
the
ancho
chilis
and
perhaps
a
slight
herbal
mineral
bitterness
from
the
annato
the
chocolate
is
rather
light
and
smells
faintly
creamy
the
taste
is
very
nice
much
more
pronounced
in
flavors
but
balanced
and
still
somewhat
subtle
creamy
chocolate
that
tastes
almost
like
cacao
pulp
somewhat
herbal
soft
and
lightly
chocolatey
there
is
also
an
underlying
lightly
fruity
roasty
chili
flavor
that
segues
into
a
final
nutty
creaminess
although
i
think
this
is
rather
lightly
spiced
i
find
that
the
chili
definitely
is
present
and
adds
a
distinct
element
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
doesnt
at
all
seem
like
a
9
beer
i
like
this
offering
from
dfh
drinkability
insanely
interesting
and
very
tasty
as
well
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
if
you
dont
like
chili
beers
give
this
a
try
its
nothing
like
crazy
eds
and
totally
different
than
rogues
yummy
pours
a
hazy
rustic
wheat
tinted
amber
color
with
a
huge
offwhite
foamy
head
that
resists
fading
gotta
love
that
head
takes
it
better
than
a
4
0
but
the
hang
time
makes
it
less
than
a
4
5
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
in
its
wake
the
smell
is
really
interesting
but
timid
at
first
nose
im
flushed
with
an
earthy
belgian
yeasty
character
that
leads
me
to
a
harvest
fruit
like
aroma
saison
farmhouselike
at
first
if
i
let
my
imagination
run
wild
i
sense
that
earthy
yeast
thing
breaking
down
to
a
malty
necco
chocolate
and
that
ever
so
light
tangy
texture
may
actually
be
the
chili
im
sooo
not
familiar
with
the
nose
is
scoring
points
for
complexity
as
it
warms
up
again
id
go
something
slightly
more
than
a
4
0
because
of
the
complexity
but
less
than
a
4
5
because
the
characteristics
are
subtle
the
mouth
is
adequately
carbonated
medium
bodied
fundamentally
creamy
with
a
nice
tangy
note
the
texture
complements
the
flavors
nicely
again
similar
to
a
farmhouse
but
with
a
mild
chocolaty
aftertaste
that
lingers
in
the
aftroof
of
the
mouth
the
9
abv
is
integrated
well
enhancing
its
drinkability
beware
thats
real
alcohol
content
theyre
advertising
this
one
is
another
pure
pleasure
to
consider
where
would
we
be
without
the
folks
at
dfh
experimenting
with
these
off
centered
notions
of
historic
ales
cheers
this
is
more
like
a
kitchen
sink
beer
than
a
chili
beer
its
got
all
the
crap
that
the
ancients
could
think
of
including
a
little
bit
of
malt
the
beer
has
a
bright
copperamber
hue
at
first
but
poured
a
hazy
rusty
hue
toward
the
end
of
the
bomber
head
formation
was
fair
as
well
as
retention
and
lacing
rich
aromas
of
honey
chocolate
toffee
and
molassas
fills
the
nose
along
with
herbal
and
perfumy
notes
flavors
strongly
favor
the
honey
and
mask
a
lot
of
the
malt
base
very
sweet
to
taste
with
a
powerful
underlying
taste
of
cocoa
almonds
pecans
and
cashews
again
hints
of
corriander
orange
peel
cherries
cumin
and
a
flowery
note
give
the
beer
a
lot
of
complexity
flavors
of
the
chilis
gain
intensity
and
are
noticed
going
into
the
finish
the
beers
weight
favors
the
honey
as
well
but
allowing
a
soft
malt
blend
to
substantiate
the
beer
quite
warming
from
midpalate
on
from
a
blend
of
the
chilis
and
alcohol
the
heat
never
offends
but
does
give
the
beer
a
little
something
extra
the
chilis
also
seem
to
balance
the
sweetness
with
the
low
hop
if
any
additions
a
very
nice
experimental
beer
ill
have
to
see
how
this
one
ages
out
pours
a
ruby
orange
in
color
with
no
head
that
forms
too
long
on
the
pour
smell
is
very
floral
with
a
good
amount
of
honey
taste
is
fairly
sweet
light
and
refreshing
im
getting
a
bit
of
light
fruit
as
well
really
clean
and
amazingly
noncloying
in
the
mouth
ive
taken
several
sips
of
this
beer
and
still
cant
figure
it
out
theres
just
so
much
going
on
in
this
beer
that
it
keeps
it
interesting
good
and
very
interesting
beer
but
not
setting
the
world
afire
i
find
this
beer
very
interesting
and
drinkable
considering
its
9
abv
its
making
me
wish
i
had
a
dark
fruit
dessert
of
some
sort
maybe
a
rum
raisin
cake
or
some
bread
puddingmmm
id
definitely
try
this
one
again
and
would
consider
hanging
on
to
a
bottle
for
a
special
occasion
just
because
it
is
a
pretty
neat
beer
this
isnt
just
a
novelty
styled
beer
but
a
good
beer
that
can
stand
up
on
its
own
im
not
really
sure
what
to
think
about
this
beer
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
then
again
not
too
many
beers
have
that
quality
there
are
things
in
this
beer
that
ive
never
experienced
i
realize
i
sound
like
im
not
writing
about
a
beer
at
this
point
but
it
really
doesnt
impress
me
that
much
appearance
is
lacking
and
aroma
could
use
a
boost
but
really
im
only
saying
this
because
thats
what
i
want
to
match
in
my
head
the
truth
is
this
beer
has
an
interesting
mix
between
sweetness
and
spice
that
might
create
an
interesting
drinking
experience
for
some
people
but
right
now
im
just
not
that
person
a
good
beer
very
easy
drinking
that
shows
nothing
in
the
way
of
9
abv
almost
tastes
like
a
lager
bready
malts
with
a
crisp
carbonation
on
the
finish
that
helps
things
end
creamy
light
cocoa
attributes
wonderfully
balanced
and
sophisticated
beer
lack
big
complexity
but
sometimes
the
over
complex
gets
old
overall
i
was
very
disappointed
in
this
i
remember
reading
of
the
aztecs
making
chocolate
drinks
with
chilis
and
i
was
hoping
it
would
at
least
have
some
flavor
aspect
from
those
ingredients
cheers
dneedless
to
say
this
is
a
first
of
many
for
me
it
improved
vastly
with
time
sitting
at
the
stick
looking
for
my
next
glass
overall
im
proud
to
have
a
limited
production
from
dogfish
and
wont
need
to
worry
about
the
buying
limit
had
at
the
union
thanks
tp
poured
into
a
small
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
orange
with
a
thin
off
white
head
a
little
fizzy
smell
is
very
faint
light
amounts
of
chocolate
and
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
all
over
the
place
but
fantastic
i
get
some
chocolate
at
first
but
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
very
light
and
fizzy
it
is
like
you
cn
fel
the
chiles
at
work
as
the
beer
warms
i
get
the
full
complement
of
flavorssome
chocolate
spices
cinamon
chile
and
even
some
coffee
how
they
do
all
those
in
a
beer
that
is
not
a
thick
syrupy
stout
or
proter
astounds
me
great
beer
very
original
d
really
weird
beer
glad
they
went
out
on
a
limb
to
make
something
like
this
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
this
all
the
time
but
it
was
good
this
was
quite
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
and
i
still
feel
ambivalent
about
it
the
beer
was
an
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
had
a
faint
cocoa
and
spice
aroma
a
cocoa
taste
with
a
peppery
background
the
pepper
lingered
for
a
long
while
but
was
not
unpleasant
id
like
to
try
this
again
overall
a
very
well
done
beer
a
sipper
due
to
the
spicyness
but
not
at
all
detracting
from
the
overall
experience
a
unique
beer
thanks
to
edbeer
for
sharing
this
one
poured
a
translucent
honey
gold
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
some
stringy
lacing
but
weak
legs
nose
is
earthy
spicy
and
cocoalicious
cocoa
character
is
amplified
in
the
nose
as
the
brew
warms
dominant
flavor
is
cocoabakers
chocolate
but
a
little
sweeter
as
well
as
honey
and
a
subtle
chili
spice
presence
mouthfeel
fell
between
light
and
medium
with
an
even
level
of
carbonation
throughout
a
truly
interesting
beer
so
much
complexity
for
such
a
lightbodiedcolored
brew
and
character
changes
as
it
warms
well
worth
a
try
unusual
and
interesting
flavor
but
not
one
that
i
could
deal
with
on
a
regular
basis
d
eh
nothing
special
and
i
cant
imagine
it
would
improve
much
with
time
but
ive
been
proven
wrong
by
dfh
before
somewhat
pale
in
colori
dont
know
quite
what
to
expect
sort
of
a
very
pale
orangeamber
color
ok
aromaquite
fruityblend
of
lemon
and
other
citrusy
smell
faint
whiff
of
honey
malty
flavor
with
a
fairly
high
level
of
sweetness
honey
like
flavor
in
the
sweetness
very
very
mild
chile
flavor
a
slight
drying
taste
which
i
am
thinking
is
off
the
cocoa
good
mouthfeelvery
light
bodied
a
very
drinkable
and
interesting
beer
not
knowing
what
to
expect
after
reading
the
label
is
sort
of
strange
well
crafted
and
quite
different
i
like
this
a
lot
more
then
say
pangea
midas
touch
or
some
of
the
other
historical
beers
they
do
great
label
too
an
interesting
sipper
yeastybready
but
with
subtle
complexities
then
a
hot
pepper
kick
that
cleaned
out
my
sinuses
a
hot
even
burning
brew
though
with
noticeable
breadiness
and
honey
that
should
take
some
of
the
heat
off
this
is
one
of
those
that
is
better
to
be
shared
and
discussed
as
a
conversation
piece
imo
this
bottle
states
9
abv
but
maybe
because
of
the
chili
it
seems
hotter
pours
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
nose
is
mild
chiles
flavor
is
smooth
slight
bite
of
a
pepperchilde
burn
there
a
smooth
sweetness
is
there
as
well
very
smooth
feel
is
slick
smooth
with
a
biting
carbonation
overall
a
nice
brew
and
for
being
a
chile
beer
doubly
so
smooth
and
not
so
straightforward
that
it
just
burns
on
the
mouth
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
imo
kind
of
comes
off
as
nearly
a
spiced
belgian
ale
of
sorts
i
was
thinking
of
taking
the
two
bottles
i
have
and
trading
them
if
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
on
tap
but
now
i
might
change
that
and
keep
one
to
drink
for
myself
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
very
complex
array
of
aromas
from
pale
and
crystal
malts
to
cocoa
and
chilies
its
unlike
anything
ive
ever
encountered
but
in
a
cool
unchartered
territory
kind
of
way
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
its
smooth
with
hints
of
cocoa
but
warming
in
the
finish
with
a
hot
pepper
hit
the
peppers
are
there
but
are
hidden
in
the
cocoa
flavor
you
dont
feel
it
until
it
hits
your
stomach
it
kind
of
burns
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
is
interesting
to
say
the
least
im
not
sure
id
buy
another
one
at
12
dollars
a
bottle
but
it
was
an
experience
a
highly
interesting
beer
and
proves
once
again
that
dfh
isnt
afraid
to
experiment
large
dfh
style

love
the

on
the

unsweetened

earth
slight

interesting
and
different
creation
by
those
innovative
dfh
brewers
cant
say
its
one
of
my
favorites
or
that
i
would
spring
12
99
for
the
bomber
for
it
again
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
something
exotic
and
it
just
seemed
a
little
halfhearted
carbonation
was
light
and
carried
it
nicely
but
i
didnt
want
any
more
after
the
one
glass
this
beer
is
weird
that
doesnt
mean
its
bad
i
was
expecting
to
have
all
these
different
flavors
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
what
it
smelledtasted
like
the
color
was
an
orangey
copper
i
drank
it
out
of
a
snifter
but
i
couldnt
decide
what
the
aroma
was
it
was
interesting
and
delicious
i
am
glad
the
apv
was
on
the
lower
side
for
dfh
i
dont
know
what
this
beer
is
but
it
is
a
good
effort
drinkability
good
and
so
is
the
mouthfeel
try
it
if
you
can
one
of
the
most
different
and
unique
beers
ive
had
id
expect
nothing
less
from
these
guys
at
the
end
of
the
beer
i
grew
to
love
it
would
have
guessed
the
alcohol
to
be
under
5
so
its
another
landmark
brew
from
history
resurrected
by
dogfish
head
and
i
am
once
again
amazed
theobroma
is
excellent
if
in
an
odd
traditional
way
never
confined
by
any
semblance
of
inthebox
thinking
the
folks
at
dfh
could
probably
make
beer
out
of
briars
and
bathwater
that
would
taste
good
sell
like
mad
and
otherwise
earn
the
respect
of
discerning
drinkers
everywhere
drink
ability
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
but
a
very
good
beer
overall
by
dfh
overall
a
easy
beer
to
drink
ive
been
waiting
for
this
ever
since
hearing
about
it
not
as
good
as
id
hoped
but
a
very
interesting
beer
and
a
must
try
ive
got
another
bottle
to
age
perhaps
a
little
time
will
do
it
some
good
d
another
great
beer
from
dogfish
this
is
awesome
d
keep
drinking
it
only
gets
better
highly
drinkable
except
for
the
availability
you
can
only
get
4
bottles
at
the
rehoboth
and
milton
locations
so
feel
free
to
horde
whatever
you
can
buy
drinkability
interesting
beer
i
might
like
to
drink
one
every
now
and
then
but
i
dont
think
im
drawn
to
consume
it
regularly
drinkability
well
the
first
glass
was
nice
the
second
was
a
little
hard
to
get
down
and
the
third
was
easy
again
had
a
buzz
it
can
be
sort
of
cloying
at
times
and
the
dry
finish
seems
to
escalate
it
i
highly
doubt
the
first
beer
tasted
anything
like
this
but
its
a
cool
concept
and
a
decent
beer
to
share
with
a
friend
drinkability
alcohols
up
there
but
this
is
one
hell
of
a
complex
and
interesting
beer
i
split
the
bottle
with
my
father
which
may
have
helped
he
was
quite
taken
aback
by
it
by
the
way
its
not
one
i
could
have
every
night
or
every
week
or
even
every
month
however
it
was
very
reasonably
priced
for
a
1
pint
9
4
oz
beer
of
this
complexity
and
could
definitely
be
a
good
specialoccasion
beer
as
many
of
dfhs
are
it
was
definitely
a
conversation
starter
at
my
table
even
my
mom
liked
it
which
is
rare
i
am
surprised
i
liked
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
as
i
have
been
repulsed
by
chile
beers
in
the
past
a
well
balanced
beer
with
a
good
flavor
even
with
the
chilies
not
a
miss
for
dfh
by
far
but
i
think
i
will
need
to
try
some
further
aged
bottles
in
a
few
months
to
see
the
full
potential
d
the
alcohol
content
is
pretty
high
and
it
becomes
more
and
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
certainly
an
intriguing
beer
as
dfh
will
be
the
scent
stands
out
in
particular
though
the
buttered
popcorn
smell
starts
to
go
away
as
it
warms
pours
a
bold
orangered
with
a
full
inch
white
head
smells
of
cloves
spices
vanilla
and
honey
first
sip
is
both
spicy
and
mellow
very
complex
a
creamy
milkshake
like
smoothness
adds
to
great
mouthfeel
unfortunately
there
is
simply
too
much
going
on
here
with
no
one
flavor
taking
charge
it
is
just
a
mess
eric
wellhidden
alcohol
without
question
and
regardless
of
anything
else
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
on
earth
at
this
point
in
time
thats
not
too
unusual
for
dfh
however
as
i
think
they
did
that
years
ago
with
immort
ale
and
there
have
been
quite
a
few
more
in
between
that
said
its
a
bit
of
a
musttry
beyond
that
its
actually
pretty
drinkable
at
9
or
10
abv
its
small
glass
fare
meant
to
be
savored
not
quaffed
and
a
bottle
can
be
split
between
2
4
people
easily
not
to
be
missed
d
really
easy
to
drink
even
thought
the
higher
abv
and
the
chilli
seems
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
really
see
how
it
stands
out
its
well
done
though
definitely
would
shine
with
some
aging
drinkability
moderate
the
flavors
are
not
offputting
but
the
combination
is
strange
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
a
9
beer
which
is
dangerous
but
theres
something
about
it
that
makes
me
content
to
just
leave
the
glass
on
the
table
a
bit
longer
than
usual
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
there
is
really
no
cocoa
nibs
or
cocoa
powder
taster
i
thought
it
would
pour
dark
but
ended
up
pouring
light
a
tint
of
orange
i
waited
for
this
beer
since
i
heard
about
it
i
was
impressed
because
it
was
so
different
i
could
not
pinpoint
one
flavor
except
maybe
the
honey
on
the
finish
and
a
little
cinnamonesqe
smell
on
the
nose
really
great
effort
by
dfh
try
it
if
you
see
it
my
review
will
make
a
little
more
sense
considering
the
beer
has
chili
in
it
its
a
very
sweet
and
flowery
beer
not
much
spiciness
at
all
makes
for
a
good
dessert
beer
nice
chewy
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
flavors
of
honey
and
grapes
reminiscent
of
midas
touch
are
then
cut
with
a
blast
of
subdued
spicyness
that
builds
in
intensity
a
subtle
chocolate
presence
appears
in
the
finish
with
notes
of
hot
cocoa
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
all
in
all
a
nicely
balanced
beer
and
a
return
to
historical
fashion
in
the
vein
of
midas
i
didnt
care
for
jihua
d
very
interesting
and
tasty
enough
9
is
a
bit
limiting
but
its
nearly
undetectable
and
drinks
pretty
easy
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
ill
probably
trade
mine
overall
this
was
unique
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
no
thanks
too
light
bodied
and
strange
for
me
nicely
done
dfh
when
are
you
bottling
served
ontap
at
the
rehoboth
brewpub
this
was
a
very
interesting
experiment
and
something
id
get
again
billed
by
the
server
as
a
chili
and
chocolate
beer
i
expected
something
dark
roasty
and
spicy
what
arrived
however
was
a
clear
gold
viscouslooking
beer
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
and
thick
lacing
pale
malty
dough
honey
and
floral
notes
in
the
bouqet
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
butter
preceded
a
taste
of
prominent
fresh
sweet
malt
that
led
to
a
semidrying
finish
nice
bit
of
cocoa
butter
on
the
back
end
along
with
some
vague
spice
rich
full
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
this
surely
doesnt
seem
like
the
10
we
were
told
it
was
drinkibility
was
not
as
good
because
it
was
so
sweet
this
beer
has
the
taste
of
a
standard
mexican
lager
with
a
really
nice
spicy
chili
finish
the
spicy
chili
flavor
is
what
makes
this
beer
taste
well
i
dont
think
that
it
is
a
great
beer
but
the
spiciness
wakes
some
senses
that
many
others
lack
undrinkable
100
capsaicin
burn
with
crappy
lager
flavor
on
top
forced
to
write
a
review
due
to
my
rating
being
an
outlier
anyway
i
fully
expected
to
hate
this
given
its
bad
reputation
paired
with
the
gimmicky
nature
of
the
beer
seriously
did
they
really
need
to
float
a
chili
in
the
bottle
turned
out
i
liked
this
beer
as
it
has
a
spicy
chili
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
this
is
pretty
high
on
the
spiciness
level
by
my
standards
but
not
unbearably
hot
the
base
beer
is
not
very
interesting
or
seems
to
be
very
well
made
but
the
chili
flavor
is
dominant
making
it
somewhat
irreverent
i
see
the
chili
beer
category
as
a
very
open
to
interpretation
category
and
for
whatever
reason
this
beer
works
for
me
i
would
like
to
also
try
using
it
in
a
michelada
still
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
most
people
as
i
can
fully
understand
why
others
have
not
liked
this
beer
aroma
is
lager
yeast
chili
peppers
not
much
else
taste
like
the
nose
lager
yeast
chili
peppers
and
not
much
else
finishes
prickly
with
a
prickly
pepper
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
due
to
the
chili
spice
moderate
carbonation
bite
may
be
exacerbated
by
the
chili
bite
light
burn
first
third
of
the
bottle
is
okay
at
best
middle
of
the
bottle
becomes
cloying
and
the
final
few
swallows
put
you
in
mind
of
pepper
vinegar
seasoning
for
your
winter
greens
im
not
a
fan
this
reminds
me
of
corona
with
a
lime
except
its
a
chili
pepper
the
flavor
is
so
weak
that
it
fully
accepts
the
additive
and
it
becomes
whether
you
enjoy
that
additive
opened
the
bottle
and
starts
to
erupt
quickly
poured
it
with
no
head
whatsoever
its
a
slightly
cloudy
orangish
gold
color
smells
like
liquid
chile
not
too
spicy
going
down
on
the
first
sip
and
tastes
like
liquid
chile
as
expected
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
chile
beer
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
and
its
much
better
than
i
remember
this
time
it
was
poured
in
a
glass
instead
of
straight
from
the
bottle
not
sure
if
that
made
any
difference
o
do
you
get
a
prize
if
the
pepper
comes
out
of
the
bottle
into
your
glass
do
you
have
to
eat
it
overall
this
beer
is
not
as
spicy
as
some
of
the
others
in
the
style
and
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
though
i
dont
think
i
will
be
running
out
to
get
another
not
enough
heat
or
flavor
tecate
with
a
pepper
i
agree
with
much
of
what
has
been
said
about
cave
creek
beer
its
just
a
boring
lager
with
spicy
pepper
oil
added
it
has
no
headcarbonation
why
i
love
this
beer
it
satisfies
my
pepper
beer
craving
its
relatively
inexpensive
and
its
not
hard
to
find
i
have
tried
several
other
pepper
beers
all
of
which
i
believe
taste
better
but
none
of
them
are
as
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
inexpensive
or
deliver
the
spicy
kick
that
this
one
does
serving
type
bottle
granted
this
is
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
amazing
when
combined
with
any
good
lunch
or
dinner
enchiladas
burgers
etc
unfortunately
on
its
own
it
is
not
too
great
chili
beers
are
a
unique
style
and
cave
creek
has
an
excellent
recipe
on
this
one
id
like
to
know
if
the
heat
comes
from
the
serrano
pepper
that
sits
in
the
bottle
or
if
there
is
some
chili
in
the
mash
great
beer
for
a
fall
day
ok
lots
of
bad
ratings
for
this
beer
but
i
differ
a
bit
yes
i
agree
that
this
is
not
a
premium
beer
with
a
premium
taste
but
as
long
as
it
is
very
cold
this
golden
hued
beer
is
very
refreshing
only
aftertaste
is
of
the
chili
and
if
you
have
any
tolerance
for
heat
the
aftertaste
is
pleasant
the
chili
i
am
sure
is
only
decorative
but
adds
a
uniquness
that
most
beers
do
not
have
i
drank
straight
from
the
bootle
and
found
a
refreshing
beverage
that
would
be
great
anytime
especially
during
a
warm
day
the
flavor
is
basically
your
average
light
lager
or
adjunct
lager
at
first
followed
by
a
vegetal
taste
then
heat
not
that
offensive
yet
not
a
lot
of
actual
malt
or
yeast
in
the
taste
either
the
taste
is
pretty
dominated
by
the
heat
of
the
jalapeno
after
the
first
tow
sips
which
again
tastes
like
the
smell
kind
of
peppery
but
i
had
to
take
a
bite
to
be
sure
it
pretty
much
extracted
all
the
heat
and
flavor
out
of
the
pepper
into
the
beer
the
pepper
inside
is
just
for
show
obviously
but
it
has
a
flavorless
fiber
only
aspect
which
explains
the
level
of
heat
in
the
beer
overall
i
guess
i
am
more
tolerant
than
others
but
the
base
beer
is
not
awful
or
seriously
flawed
enough
to
give
it
a
bad
score
mediocre
i
suppose
but
i
dont
hate
this
just
because
it
is
a
pale
lager
i
will
say
that
i
think
it
is
less
than
average
drinkbility
in
general
since
the
heat
is
all
you
really
get
which
is
not
that
refreshingcould
be
good
with
something
hearty
but
i
would
probably
avoid
this
and
dont
recommend
it
basically
a
novelty
with
the
pepper
in
the
bottle
pours
a
medium
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
head
that
settles
down
to
nothing
to
speak
of
as
well
as
not
much
lacing
to
mention
the
aroma
is
of
pepper
juice
with
some
grains
like
a
corona
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
heat
from
the
pepper
and
actually
like
a
spicy
corona
lower
carbonation
and
a
bit
on
the
light
side
ate
the
pepper
at
the
end
with
a
cracker
overall
it
is
different
and
it
was
ok
ostraight
from
the
7th
plain
of
hell
satan
would
be
proud
absolutely
disgusting
please
dont
drink
this
yourself
overall
not
a
lot
here
just
a
watery
pint
of
faint
heat
take
a
beer
any
beer
put
some
chiles
in
it
and
voila
you
can
have
your
own
custom
chili
beer
i
like
the
heat
and
the
taste
was
not
too
bad
however
there
is
no
body
whatsoever
and
the
beer
itself
is
thin
and
watery
the
only
reason
i
even
like
this
beer
at
all
is
because
of
the
heat
but
like
i
said
just
take
your
favorite
beer
and
pop
in
some
peppers
and
you
will
have
your
own
custom
great
tasting
chili
beer
as
far
as
the
marketing
it
looks
to
me
like
an
american
guy
decides
to
brew
this
beer
in
mexico
to
give
the
appearance
that
this
is
a
true
chili
beer
its
basically
some
guy
brewing
cheap
crap
in
his
garage
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
ah
the
infamous
cave
creek
chili
beer
clear
bottle
an
old
shrunken
chilli
and
everything
got
some
in
a
plastic
cup
this
looks
exactly
like
a
small
urine
sample
in
a
plastic
cup
if
there
ever
a
beer
which
deserved
to
get
05
on
appearance
this
is
the
one
nose
carries
some
vegetables
too
bad
bit
of
a
white
sugar
low
quality
old
oily
chilli
taste
is
too
much
vegetable
juice
upfront
herbs
corn
these
are
the
flavours
which
make
this
brew
not
particularly
pleasant
it
is
not
that
bad
actually
finish
carries
the
burn
nice
burn
not
that
brutal
heat
level
like
this
in
a
pale
lager
is
not
too
bad
neat
the
chilli
is
low
quality
oily
too
bad
flat
too
much
vegetable
notes
other
things
mentioned
still
as
far
as
pale
lagers
go
this
one
is
not
that
bad
o
this
style
of
beer
is
hard
to
get
right
it
can
be
easy
to
go
overboard
with
the
chilis
this
is
what
happened
with
this
one
not
recommended
a
shockingly
poor
beer
that
tastes
disgusting
in
parts
and
cheap
throughout
it
was
spicy
yet
somehow
still
seemed
bland
and
the
taste
other
than
chili
peppers
was
nonexistent
nothing
but
a
gimmick
that
should
never
have
made
it
onto
the
market
okay
i
have
had
a
chili
beer
before
it
must
have
been
about
20
years
ago
and
i
remember
it
being
absolutely
in
undrinkable
no
taste
just
unbearable
heat
so
that
was
the
benchmark
that
i
had
in
mind
when
i
opened
this
bottle
a
brew
that
my
wife
bought
for
me
as
a
little
surprise
first
of
alls
although
it
isnt
good
it
also
isnt
undrinkable
the
smell
is
of
green
chilies
maybe
a
little
spicey
pepper
and
some
adjunct
macro
lager
veggie
brew
scents
the
taste
has
heat
and
it
definitely
distracts
from
the
taste
of
the
beer
but
it
is
not
too
much
that
the
beer
isnt
drinkable
it
is
a
nice
slow
burning
heat
some
mild
sweetness
in
the
beer
the
heat
prevents
me
from
giving
a
really
accurate
description
of
the
beer
characteristics
in
themselves
light
body
i
wont
have
another
one
well
maybe
in
another
20
years
but
it
was
interesting
enough
that
although
i
didnt
like
it
i
dont
regret
trying
my
pour
netted
me
a
finger
of
fizzy
bonewhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
itself
out
of
existence
color
was
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
loads
of
co2
bubbles
in
evidence
as
i
watched
king
midas
croesus
and
mammon
slaver
over
it
i
actually
considered
giving
those
greedy
bastiges
some
of
it
just
to
teach
them
a
lesson
nose
smelled
as
though
the
pepper
had
been
in
the
bottle
for
a
while
leaching
out
its
peppery
flavors
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
the
heat
was
instantaneous
man
i
began
to
sweat
behind
my
eyeballs
and
i
wondered
how
difficult
it
might
be
to
rip
my
tongue
out
of
my
head
another
sip
was
called
for
and
the
dichotomy
of
the
cold
beer
and
the
peppery
heat
had
me
reeling
it
looked
so
innocuous
and
yet
my
sinuses
were
filled
with
heat
and
my
nose
began
to
drip
my
next
sip
caused
my
bald
spot
to
gain
a
sheen
of
sweat
and
my
eyes
watered
uncontrollably
i
was
now
well
into
my
penance
now
it
was
becoming
a
personal
challenge
how
much
could
i
get
in
my
mouth
and
swallow
without
initiating
the
gag
reflex
a
healthy
mouthful
and
swallow
later
and
who
needs
a
barium
rinse
i
could
map
the
path
from
mouth
to
gullet
to
windpipe
to
stomach
right
afterwards
yee
hah
i
was
suddenly
harder
than
chinese
arithmetic
with
russian
cyrillic
instructions
where
is
the
old
lady
when
i
need
her
steam
began
to
vent
from
my
ears
and
i
began
to
sense
that
something
may
be
going
sideways
on
this
venture
my
next
draught
left
me
gasping
for
air
as
my
throat
involuntarily
constricted
perhaps
a
small
snack
in
the
form
of
the
pepper
was
in
order
wrong
fking
answer
the
paramedics
were
quick
to
to
respond
being
as
that
i
live
only
a
few
blocks
from
lgh
and
they
burst
into
laughter
at
seeing
the
remnants
of
the
chewed
pepper
and
the
spent
bottle
laying
on
its
side
next
to
the
pepper
cmon
fellas
have
a
heart
im
in
real
pain
here
truth
be
told
it
was
hot
but
the
pepper
pilsner
at
the
great
dane
was
way
worse
i
would
not
want
another
again
right
away
but
it
was
kind
of
fun
to
finally
try
one
of
these
from
a
commerciallyavailable
bottle
i
must
start
out
by
saying
that
i
love
heat
and
peppers
i
have
broken
the
golden
rule
of
ba
on
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
avoided
it
because
of
the
poor
ratings
but
i
finally
decided
to
get
over
it
and
buy
a
bottle
to
try
lol
pour
has
a
head
that
is
gone
in
no
time
bright
straw
color
im
expecting
a
lot
of
pepper
flavor
in
this
beer
since
there
probably
wont
be
a
ton
of
flavor
to
the
base
beer
its
tastes
like
it
smells
like
drinking
pepper
juice
without
all
the
vinegar
nice
heat
on
the
tongue
from
the
first
sip
i
have
to
say
for
the
style
i
like
this
but
not
as
much
as
some
other
pepper
beers
i
would
let
a
fellow
pepper
head
try
this
but
wouldnt
suggest
that
people
who
dont
like
heat
give
this
a
second
thought
no
hops
grain
any
other
profile
but
for
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
it
does
its
job
drinkability
theres
not
much
flavor
to
this
beer
other
than
spicy
chili
so
its
not
highly
drinkable
its
boring
and
spicy
thank
god
i
didnt
have
to
buy
another
fricking
bottle
of
this
since
apparently
someone
actually
drinks
it
the
chili
pepper
in
the
beer
was
a
unexpected
surprise
but
outside
of
the
chili
pepper
heat
this
beer
is
meh
generic
lager
with
pepper
in
it
the
pepper
is
all
in
the
back
end
of
it
so
its
not
too
hot
too
drink
tried
it
once
wouldnt
get
it
again
update
i
found
a
great
substitute
take
cheap
mexican
beer
i
use
indio
and
add
1
tablespoon
of
italian
pepperoncini
juice
drained
from
a
jar
of
pepperoncini
peppers
done
warning
mere
mortals
may
not
be
able
to
handle
the
heat
personally
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
refreshing
o
overall
pretty
weird
but
not
terrible
id
like
to
try
some
more
chile
beers
i
love
hot
foods
so
this
thing
wasnt
very
hot
for
me
only
mildly
spicy
t
grains
heavy
pepper
light
spicy
finish
this
is
like
a
bad
mexican
lager
with
pepper
added
the
lager
is
sweet
and
incredibly
grainy
the
pepper
is
pleasant
but
it
cant
save
this
one
this
is
a
novelty
and
nothing
more
ive
heard
bad
things
about
this
but
i
figure
its
worth
trying
at
least
once
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
before
62213
this
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
pepper
in
the
bottom
and
a
short
lived
small
head
the
smells
are
of
chili
along
with
adjuncts
not
much
else
the
feel
is
light
the
taste
is
poor
but
unusual
a
light
amount
of
beer
tastes
upfront
along
with
some
pepper
and
chili
burn
o
cave
creek
chili
beer
isnt
just
a
beer
its
an
experience
from
the
floating
pepper
in
the
beer
to
the
spicy
lager
taste
this
goldlabeled
beer
is
unique
to
be
sure
certainly
polarizing
cave
creek
chili
beer
wont
appeal
to
everyone
in
fact
it
probably
wont
appeal
to
most
people
but
theres
a
market
for
it
and
if
theres
one
beer
i
can
think
of
that
would
go
great
with
some
mexican
food
it
would
be
this
beer
per
the
label
it
doesnt
even
seem
to
be
brewed
with
a
chili
rather
its
added
to
the
bottle
for
the
finished
product
which
is
pretty
impressive
especially
since
its
not
off
and
it
doesnt
exhibit
characteristics
of
a
poorly
made
beer
ill
skip
eating
the
chili
though
poured
out
crystal
clear
and
is
accompanied
by
a
plethora
of
bubbles
and
carbonation
the
head
starts
off
semi
thickroughly
half
a
finger
thick
but
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
ring
of
white
bubbles
around
the
outer
edge
of
the
beer
it
smells
like
your
average
light
beer
think
budlight
but
with
a
slight
hint
of
pepper
it
also
smells
slightly
tart
its
rather
dull
you
can
pick
up
the
tart
taste
of
a
ripe
pepper
some
mild
metallic
flavors
and
not
much
else
this
isnt
a
bad
tasting
beer
just
an
average
chili
beer
and
still
refreshing
none
the
less
overall
i
can
enjoy
a
pepper
beer
but
i
dont
enjoy
this
cheers
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
has
that
smell
of
cheap
corona
with
a
slight
pepper
scent
tasty
is
rather
watery
but
the
chili
pepper
does
come
back
with
a
bite
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
beer
it
tastes
more
like
water
that
some
threw
some
tabasco
into
this
seems
less
like
a
beer
and
more
like
something
someone
would
only
drink
on
a
dare
can
totally
understand
the
0
rating
also
on
another
note
i
read
a
review
that
warned
not
to
eat
the
pepper
this
made
me
conduct
this
act
the
pepper
had
really
lost
almost
all
of
its
flavor
and
heat
to
the
beer
i
was
hoping
to
regret
this
decision
and
end
up
trying
to
rake
it
off
my
tongue
with
a
fork
but
this
was
not
the
case
rather
the
pepper
tasted
like
a
rather
earthy
raw
mushroom
go
figure
too
bad
onot
as
bad
as
the
reviews
good
chili
flavor
good
for
what
it
should
be
drink
would
be
best
as
a
marinade
not
a
drink
t
very
watery
with
a
ton
of
sweet
boiled
corn
flavor
heat
hits
about
midway
an
takes
over
anything
else
in
the
way
of
flavor
very
thin
mouthfeel
really
really
not
good
this
is
a
cooking
beer
i
can
think
of
dozens
of
things
to
do
with
this
brew
but
drinking
it
again
doesnt
even
cross
my
mind
enjoy
it
for
cooking
ive
seen
this
heaps
of
times
before
and
never
bought
it
but
when
my
mate
came
round
he
thought
it
was
great
and
brought
a
sixer
over
i
think
the
chilli
pepper
floating
in
the
bottle
novelty
must
of
sold
him
and
pours
very
similar
to
a
corona
a
urine
looking
colour
with
a
fizzy
one
finger
head
and
no
lacingthe
smell
is
basically
fresh
green
chilli
which
is
floating
in
the
bottle
and
a
stale
pub
but
the
chilli
dominates
and
to
be
honest
probably
saved
it
from
a
1
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
but
thicker
than
a
corona
and
on
taste
the
chilli
basically
dominates
from
start
to
finish
it
really
does
pack
some
heat
and
only
allows
feint
tastes
of
grains
and
a
herbal
grassiness
to
come
through
and
overall
its
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
but
i
have
to
give
credit
due
to
heat
of
the
chilli
as
most
chilli
beers
ive
tried
dont
really
have
the
heat
like
this
one
id
just
like
to
see
a
nice
combination
of
beer
and
chilli
and
this
isnt
it
cheers
overall
i
would
only
suggest
drinking
this
beer
as
a
dare
i
took
a
sip
20
minutes
ago
and
my
chest
is
still
burning
d
well
two
sips
and
i
am
sure
done
i
really
really
tried
to
like
this
but
it
provides
absolutely
no
enjoyment
flavorwise
but
rather
pain
and
a
temporary
loss
in
my
ability
to
taste
anything
else
poured
from
a
clear
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
spicy
hot
taste
is
heat
heat
and
more
heat
watery
hot
sauce
with
no
other
flavors
able
to
penetrate
the
heat
feels
hot
in
the
mouth
and
half
of
this
beer
went
down
the
drain

hopefully
i
havent
grossed
any
beer
drinkers
out
who
dont
like
chili
beers
but
dont
assume
you
dont
like
them
until
you
try
them
unfortunately
cave
creek
chili
beer
is
sometimes
hard
to
find
but
if
you
run
across
a
store
that
sells
it
at
least
shell
out
810
bucks
once
to
try
it
so
you
can
say
you
have
this
is
a
drain
pour
and
i
legitimately
feel
bad
for
the
drain
honestly
this
is
so
terrible
that
i
almost
regret
buying
it
it
tastes
like
hatred
misery
and
sadness
the
only
beer
that
i
can
place
in
the
same
level
of
hell
as
this
nightmare
is
samuel
adams
triple
bock
i
think
i
feel
tears
forming
in
my
eyes
and
its
not
from
the
heat
this
is
bottled
agony
the
funniest
part
is
that
i
paid
3
for
the
bottle
out
of
sheer
curiousity
and
reviewing
pleasure
i
feel
like
im
deserved
a
free
tshirt
or
tin
of
altoids
or
something
will
never
be
drinking
this
again
insert

d
take
it
for
what
it
is
slightly
gimmicky
but
delivers
the
heat
of
the
chili
pepper
in
the
form
of
a
beer
i
have
never
had
a
chili
beer
quite
like
this
one
i
dont
think
this
is
a
despicable
beer
just
not
for
everyone
now
do
i
dare
eat
the
pepper
o
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
the
pepper
smell
is
so
rancid
and
overpowering
it
was
tough
to
even
try
a
few
sips
for
the
purpose
of
this
review
notes
i
would
say
it
is
worth
trying
once
just
to
see
how
bad
it
is
and
as
a
novelty
drink
even
without
all
the
pepper
taste
this
would
be
a
bad
beer
this
is
not
just
a
bad
beer
it
is
an
offensive
one
the
kind
of
beer
that
takes
your
mother
out
to
dinner
shows
her
a
good
time
and
never
calls
again
i
have
a
policy
of
no
drain
pours
this
beer
tested
that
policy
and
stretched
to
the
limit
oh
and
if
you
are
drinking
this
beer
you
might
as
well
eat
the
pepper
as
it
is
probably
the
least
offensive
part
and
lost
essentially
all
of
its
heat
so
it
is
a
slightly
waxy
pulpy
shell
of
a
jalapeño
pours
a
terrible
fizzy
nearly
clear
straw
yellow
the
head
is
gone
as
soon
as
it
makes
contact
with
the
glass
smell
is
standard
lager
corn
with
a
twist
of
lime
yikes
this
beer
is
hot
actually
tastes
close
to
what
i
expected
somewhat
sweet
cereal
malts
with
a
huge
pickled
jalapeno
backing
it
i
am
not
going
to
lie
i
love
the
taste
if
you
cant
handle
spicy
food
then
the
drinkability
will
suffer
for
you
but
i
happen
to
love
spicy
aside
from
the
terrible
body
and
lack
of
smell
this
beer
excels
and
what
it
set
out
to
do
i
expected
to
hate
it
turns
out
i
was
wrong
poured
warily
into
a
pint
glass
dammit
plop
goes
the
pepper
pale
ginger
ale
color
clear
with
a
slight
chill
haze
riddled
with
bubbly
sodalike
carbonation
at
first
but
no
head
whatsoever
aroma
of
distant
grains
creamed
corn
a
little
bit
of
scent
from
the
pepper
tasted
entirely
bland
watered
down
grain
juice
with
a
little
bit
of
heat
from
the
pepper
on
the
palate
not
very
hot
and
not
much
taste
from
it
at
all
light
body
super
watery
and
just
really
awful
as
expected
worth
a
try
as
a
novelty
item
i
suppose
if
you
love
spicy
and
dont
care
about
a
beers
flavor
this
may
just
be
the
perfect
beer
for
you
if
you
hate
spicy
leave
this
beer
alone
if
you
like
beer
with
decent
flavor
leave
this
beer
alone
do
i
need
to
really
say
much
more
overall
a
pepper
beer
period
im
a
sucker
for
trying
it
but
it
is
what
it
is
complete
novelty
easily
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
and
this
one
is
completely
deserving
of
its
score
the
simple
fact
they
bottle
this
and
actually
are
getting
sales
like
me
for
consumption
is
mindblowing
although
this
might
be
good
to
cook
mexican
food
with
o
cheap
gimmicky
beer
filler
with
a
chili
thrown
in
just
for
kicks
id
rather
drink
any
number
of
malt
liquor
even
at
a
comparable
price
the
only
redeeming
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
pepper
which
i
used
to
make
tacos
what
kind
of
salsa
do
the
other
reviewers
use
at
a
mexican
resturant
tomato
juice
really
this
was
not
hot
while
not
completely
undrinkable
its
true
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
i
thought
i
might
like
it
i
mean
i
like
lagers
i
like
peppers
and
spicy
food
the
problem
again
is
that
this
beer
tastes
pickled
very
vegetal
and
weird
o
its
ok
for
a
novelty
beer
but
i
cant
picture
anyone
honestly
sitting
and
drinking
more
than
one
if
they
can
even
get
through
it
this
beer
pours
an
average
beer
color
with
no
head
or
lace
its
aroma
is
simply
chili
pepper
no
more
no
less
the
flavor
is
chili
pepper
over
the
top
hot
and
unpalatable
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
hot
original
c
cave
creek
chili
beer
is
a
nasty
beer
just
heat
no
flavor
or
complexity
drain
pour
this
one
not
recommended
if
anything
i
guess
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
behind
the
awkward
spiciness
of
the
chili
but
im
definitely
not
convinced
thats
a
good
thing
as
a
beer
it
certainly
fails
but
still
its
not
quite
as
bad
as
i
was
led
to
believe
the
aroma
is
just
hot
chili
and
this
transfers
to
the
taste
just
hot
green
chili
im
not
sure
that
hot
green
chili
was
meant
to
be
drank
like
this
although
i
think
the
green
chili
used
would
make
awesome
enchiladas
even
the
aftertaste
has
a
green
chili
hotness
to
it
this
beer
would
probably
be
better
used
as
a
cooking
aid
instead
of
a
stand
alone
drink
the
burn
in
my
throat
still
isnt
subsiding
thank
goodness
for
calcium
tablets
first
of
all
why
is
chili
beer
even
a
style
i
had
this
in
the
fridge
for
a
few
week
and
was
afraid
to
taste
it
it
was
our
botm
clubs
pick
it
looks
like
a
refreshing
mexican
lager
clear
light
bright
yellow
except
for
the
chili
pepper
the
smell
is
all
chili
pepper
the
taste
is
all
chili
pepper
a
nice
burn
hangs
on
the
lips
i
dont
know
if
i
will
be
able
to
finish
the
bottle
i
can
see
this
be
a
great
beer
to
add
to
mexican
food
but
not
just
to
drink
the
cpj
the
spice
dominates
the
palate
honestly
its
not
all
that
terrible
pretty
onedimensional
and
fades
quickly
the
vinegar
i
picked
up
on
the
nose
doesnt
come
across
on
the
taste
thankfully
this
comes
from
cerveceria
mexicana
makers
of
tecate
but
the
beer
itself
has
more
body
and
malt
than
their
flagship
brew
not
a
winner
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
theres
definitely
some
potential
hereeven
if
it
is
just
for
cooking
some
killer
borracho
beans
the
only
reason
this
beer
must
still
be
in
existence
is
due
to
its
novelty
i
can
already
think
of
two
or
three
friends
who
are
getting
this
for
their
birthdays
not
to
mention
my
coworkers
i
mean
no
one
can
really
enjoy
this
let
alone
buy
a
6pack
of
it
i
was
going
to
say
that
unless
super
spicy
foods
are
you
thing
you
should
stay
away
from
this
beer
but
ive
decided
that
everyone
needs
to
stay
away
from
this
beer
only
buy
a
bottle
if
you
plan
to
leave
it
under
your
bed
to
use
as
mace
in
case
of
burglary
let
me
save
you
time
and
money
do
not
buy
this
beer
the
other
reviews
on
this
page
are
spot
on
so
i
will
not
go
into
much
detail
here
overall
this
beer
is
disgusting
in
appearance
smell
taste
and
texture
it
has
no
redeeming
qualities
whatsoever
brewing
a
pepper
beer
that
has
depth
in
flavor
is
more
of
an
art
than
just
dropping
a
stupid
serrano
pepper
into
a
weak
beer
as
cave
creek
did
needless
to
say
producing
this
beer
should
be
considered
a
crime
against
humanity
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
12
inch
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
whatsoever
the
only
smell
i
am
getting
on
this
one
is
the
vinegar
used
to
pack
jalapenos
after
the
peppers
are
removed
from
the
container
i
actually
like
jalapenos
and
pickling
brine
used
in
pickles
and
jalapenos
so
this
isnt
that
offputting
by
itself
taste
is
of
a
typical
mexican
lager
think
corona
with
the
spicy
brine
poured
in
again
not
so
bad
because
i
like
these
pickled
jalapenos
however
there
is
really
no
beer
flavor
that
dominates
this
one
a
very
spicy
burning
lingers
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
throat
after
each
sip
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
high
so
this
is
like
a
spicy
jalapeno
soda
overall
this
isnt
a
very
good
beer
yes
its
a
chile
beer
and
yes
the
chiles
are
front
and
center
on
this
one
but
these
aromas
and
flavors
overpower
any
other
real
beer
characteristics
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
though
well
not
that
bad
but
wouldnt
buy
it
again
had
i
bought
it
in
the
first
place
in
fact
if
you
like
this
beer
there
ought
to
be
a
sign
in
your
front
yard
warning
neighbors
and
visitors
that
youre
a
crazy
son
of
a
bitch
capable
of
anything
wow
just
wow
if
i
typed
like
i
would
talk
right
now
it
would
be
indecipherable
i
cant
complain
about
truth
in
advertising
in
this
case
this
is
one
tangy
beer
the
resident
pepper
gave
its
all
it
would
seem
so
the
problem
becomes
as
in
a
number
of
fruit
beer
experiences
when
does
the
guest
ingredient
overpower
the
essential
beerness
of
a
beer
well
ladies
and
germs
feast
your
watering
eyes
on
exhibit
a
so
spicy
that
the
rest
of
the
beer
as
good
or
bad
as
it
might
be
cant
fuck
it
up
i
am
biased
in
that
i
use
serrano
peppers
a
lot
in
cooking
in
fact
im
making
kung
pao
tonight
and
may
just
add
this
little
remnant
in
my
glass
to
the
dish
why
the
hell
not
i
thought
the
beer
began
to
grow
on
me
somewhat
at
first
the
chili
flavours
were
too
powerful
but
as
i
got
used
to
them
the
beer
became
more
drinkable
ive
had
one
before
many
years
ago
in
a
mextex
restaurant
in
london
but
that
was
well
before
becoming
a
ba
glad
ive
had
another
you
cant
be
unkind
on
the
scoring
front
it
says
its
a
chili
beer
thats
what
it
is
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
a
flaming
sack
of
shit
but
boy
was
i
wrong
it
does
flame
but
its
not
too
bad
it
looks
like
yellow
pee
water
and
has
no
head
or
lacing
at
all
it
smells
mostly
just
like
chili
peppers
but
not
in
a
horrific
way
taste
was
pretty
hot
and
would
be
really
nice
at
a
bbq
or
with
some
nachos
nice
chili
flavor
mouthfeel
is
ok
not
great
pretty
nice
definitely
a
cool
interesting
change
of
pace
overall
i
thought
beer
was
pretty
mediocre
balance
goes
a
long
way
with
these
beers
and
is
what
separates
a
good
chili
beer
from
a
bad
one
this
beer
didnt
have
good
balance
i
could
barely
taste
the
base
of
this
beer
the
chili
peppers
dominated
everything
and
didnt
let
anything
else
shine
through
this
has
to
be
the
hottest
chili
beer
i
have
had
with
dragonmeads
ring
of
fire
being
the
only
beer
that
comes
close
hotness
wise
drinkability
was
very
poor
i
struggled
to
drink
the
second
half
of
this
beer
it
just
didnt
stop
burning
you
would
have
to
be
a
glutton
for
punishment
to
want
to
drink
more
then
one
of
these
i
do
think
this
would
make
a
great
beer
to
cook
with
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
some
chili
or
beer
can
chicken
would
be
with
this
beer
in
it
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
reaction
i
got
from
letting
my
friends
take
a
sip
and
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
lack
of
balance
there
was
so
much
chili
in
this
beer
that
it
overpowered
everything
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
wanted
to
pull
a
prank
on
someone
or
for
cooking
but
not
for
personal
consumption
unless
you
just
love
chili
peppers
you
might
want
to
avoid
this
beer
i
just
wasnt
impressed
with
beer
it
was
pretty
much
a
chili
bomb
and
it
tore
my
stomach
up
looks
like
i
will
be
popping
tums
all
night
this
beer
was
exactly
what
it
claimed
to
be
but
it
was
just
too
hot
and
too
much
for
me
o
not
as
wretched
as
i
expected
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
a
game
of
truth
or
dare
still
complexity
and
drinkability
rate
poorly
all
sizzle
no
substance
i
really
do
not
like
this
beer
at
all
but
they
do
do
a
good
job
of
making
it
very
jalapeñoy
if
youre
into
novelty
items
and
spicy
food
then
this
the
beer
for
you
if
youre
into
good
beer
then
not
so
much
overall
a
terrible
beer
all
it
does
is
burn
your
throat
only
bought
it
because
i
wanted
to
try
the
worst
beer
on
ba
it
lived
up
to
its
expectations
it
would
be
an
awesome
beer
to
prank
someone
with
could
you
imagine
the
poor
sap
that
tried
to
take
this
from
a
beer
bong
ha
ha
ha
pours
light
golden
with
a
head
that
disappeared
faster
then
i
could
pour
the
beer
this
smells
mostly
like
chili
and
i
couldnt
get
many
more
smells
out
of
it
the
chili
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
and
gives
this
beer
a
very
spicy
and
unique
flavor
i
feel
that
the
chili
flavor
does
detract
from
the
other
flavors
that
could
be
in
the
beer
and
just
makes
this
kind
of
a
gimmick
i
know
that
alot
of
people
have
bad
things
to
day
about
this
beer
but
i
think
it
is
kind
of
a
cool
idea
the
chili
is
a
bit
overpowering
and
that
is
really
my
only
complaint
i
would
like
to
see
this
done
where
the
chili
just
enhances
the
flavors
in
the
beer
and
i
think
that
would
make
for
a
cool
brew
by
the
way
i
did
eat
the
pepper
theres
nothing
drinkable
about
this
its
vile
if
you
want
to
try
a
much
better
chile
beer
try
cerveza
chilebeso
by
great
basin
brewery
as
a
novelty
beer
it
was
interesting
fun
and
not
so
bad
that
id
condemn
it
i
definitely
would
not
lump
it
in
with
more
serious
beer
offerings
it
is
what
it
is
would
i
buy
another
maybe
odefinitely
a
chili
beer
but
its
way
too
over
bearing
for
me
to
be
enjoyable
in
any
respect
i
took
2
tastes
and
down
the
drain
it
went
this
beer
only
caters
to
a
very
select
group
of
individuals
gold
liquid
some
sudsy
head
that
dissolves
quickly
lots
of
carbonation
some
sweet
lager
odor
but
mostly
chile
pepper
sweet
vegetable
flavor
nice
little
kick
from
the
pepper
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
or
maybe
just
as
the
beer
warms
it
starts
to
taste
more
like
a
bottle
of
hot
sauce
an
interesting
experience
but
if
i
ever
drink
it
again
it
will
just
be
to
see
how
it
goes
with
mexican
food
this
a
good
beer
to
give
a
drunk
guy
who
is
getting
on
everyones
nerves
want
him
to
slow
down
here
buddy
have
one
of
these
this
was
thankfully
split
amongst
a
few
friends
one
of
whom
bellied
up
and
ate
the
pepper
this
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
no
head
whatsoever
that
could
be
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
over
2
months
past
its
expiration
date
too
the
aroma
is
spicy
the
problems
that
i
have
with
smelling
the
pepper
oil
is
all
the
flooding
memories
of
chelada
came
back
and
i
got
scared
overall
it
really
just
smells
like
cerrano
pepper
oil
there
may
be
some
corn
syrup
in
the
background
but
for
the
most
part
its
not
really
there
i
really
could
if
wanted
to
drink
this
but
after
about
4
sips
i
truly
decided
against
continuing
to
consume
this
beverage
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
said
capsicum
tingle
for
mouthfeel
so
thats
a
bonus
overall
im
truly
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
it
was
really
not
drinkable
for
more
than
a
few
sips
and
was
truly
just
a
mere
novelty
original
c
cave
creek
chili
beer
ive
been
looking
for
this
one
for
a
while
bottle
from
wine
world
in
jersey
hiss
with
a
pry
occccb
pours
out
a
uninspired
pale
yellow
with
fizz
but
not
enough
for
a
sparse
cap
looks
dead
after
30
seconds
smell
is
all
peppers
chili
mexico
watered
down
corona
it
is
what
it
is
on
first
sips
im
greeted
by
some
spice
with
pepper
and
some
watered
down
mexican
beer
two
seconds
later
my
mouth
is
spiced
out
of
proportion
with
clashing
chilipepper
what
have
you
gross
i
could
taste
this
for
about
a
half
hour
afterwards
it
almost
wrecked
my
palate
mind
you
feel
is
fizzy
thin
with
carb
but
for
what
the
beer
is
carbed
ill
give
it
that
but
the
aftertaste
of
shame
is
huge
im
glad
to
give
this
a
whirl
the
us
should
use
this
beer
as
a
interogation
tactic
for
terrorists
that
is
all
jeez
who
came
up
with
this
this
is
barely
drinkable
at
all
the
pepper
contaminates
the
beer
all
together
and
makes
it
like
drinking
fresh
squeezed
pepper
juice
this
almost
has
to
be
a
joke
its
one
thing
to
put
fruit
in
beer
but
to
put
something
like
a
pepper
in
it
is
just
crazy
people
drink
beer
to
kill
the
burn
of
spicy
foods
not
add
to
it
the
aroma
and
taste
of
this
is
just
chili
pepper
nothing
else
its
become
my
lifes
mission
to
find
the
person
who
made
this
and
kill
them
and
their
entire
family
this
was
one
of
the
worst
if
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
nothing
here
redeeming
even
in
a
style
that
most
may
not
like
this
was
at
the
bottom
never
again
i
tried
this
for
the
novelty
hoping
that
maybe
just
maybe
i
would
kind
of
like
it
because
i
love
spicy
food
very
unfortunate
beer
overall
note
i
rated
this
a
chili
beer
i
also
ate
a
banana
to
make
my
morning
trip
to
the
bathroom
more
pleasantuse
google
bm
me
to
find
out
why
this
brew
is
not
very
good
drink
at
all
its
super
thin
and
doesnt
have
much
body
i
am
having
a
hard
time
finishing
this
brew
the
heat
is
not
over
bearing
but
its
just
something
hard
to
get
down
i
could
only
do
one
in
a
setting
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
would
never
seek
out
this
brew
again
overall
for
what
it
is
it
aint
too
bad
nothing
that
id
go
and
buy
a
6
pack
of
but
a
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
along
side
a
mexican
dish
d
the
smell
makes
me
think
ill
throw
up
the
tastes
confirms
that
thought
i
always
finish
my
beer
because
there
are
sober
kids
in
india
that
is
until
this
one
on
the
bright
side
it
might
work
as
well
as
draino
end
warning
beer
with
a
serrano
chile
poured
in
a
pilsenerbayern
glass
left
the
chile
in
the
bottle
look
yellow
urine
no
head
and
shitload
of
bubbles
smell
serrano
chile
and
vinegar
not
offensive
but
somewhat
rare
taste
lots
of
serrano
chile
pepper
and
tabasco
sauce
probably
vinegar
and
light
notes
of
pale
malt
mouthfeel
spicy
which
then
becomes
acidic
leaves
the
throat
burning
light
body
and
the
carbonation
is
confused
with
the
itch
drinkability
thought
the
chile
was
trime
but
bites
a
lot
drinkability
a
pretty
easy
drink
but
not
something
to
indulge
in
paired
with
pepperoni
pizza
maybe
i
should
have
tried
a
taco
original
cave
creek
chili
beer
was
bright
gold
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
large
white
head
that
almost
instantly
disappeared
with
no
lace
the
smell
was
all
chili
pepper
the
taste
was
also
all
chili
pepper
with
a
dry
throat
burning
finish
it
was
light
bodied
with
fairly
light
carbonation
drinkability
was
terrible
as
i
dumped
at
least
half
of
it
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
try
again
and
i
would
not
recommend
to
anyone
but
a
pepperhead
and
then
still
probably
not
this
creative
beer
there
is
an
actual
whole
green
chili
pepper
inside
every
bottle
opens
with
a
sickly
pallid
complexion
and
a
nonexistent
head
the
only
scent
i
get
is
not
surprisingly
jalapeno
the
taste
is
well
like
hot
sauce
the
pepper
far
overpowers
the
ultralight
lager
beer
its
suspended
in
i
have
to
admit
its
a
nice
novelty
for
the
beer
fan
who
thinks
heshes
had
it
all
but
this
one
is
just
not
appetizing
at
all
im
not
one
to
ever
waste
a
beer
but
this
ones
a
pourer
d
can
i
give
it
a
zero
it
doesnt
taste
horrible
but
it
is
not
any
more
drinkable
than
most
hot
sauces
and
indeed
less
drinkable
than
some
d
a
sink
poorer
for
sure
this
almost
upsets
my
stomach
steer
clear
of
this
one
lads
this
beer
is
exactly
what
is
claims
to
be
a
chili
beer
when
you
open
the
bottle
you
immediately
notice
the
smell
of
fresh
chillies
and
a
hint
of
yeast
once
poured
the
head
only
lasts
for
around
5
seconds
and
then
it
just
looks
like
ginger
ale
this
beer
tastes
like
fresh
chili
peppers
and
you
even
get
a
mild
amount
of
hotness
the
brewer
succeeded
in
making
a
beer
that
tastes
exactly
like
fresh
chilies
but
im
not
sure
whether
that
is
a
good
thing
d
all
burn
all
the
time
there
are
really
no
other
flavors
except
for
a
slight
green
chili
note
this
is
liquid
carbonated
fire
i
like
spice
and
heat
but
not
when
it
is
the
only
thing
you
taste
i
didnt
even
get
any
corn
or
grain
or
malt
notes
never
again
no
way
no
how
its
not
blended
or
mingled
well
there
are
two
natures
and
they
do
not
belong
together
its
an
afterthought
a
gimmick
sure
i
can
drink
it
without
getting
blasted
with
alcohol
poisoning
but
i
forced
myself
to
even
finish
half
of
this
twelve
ounce
bottle
drinkability
blah
i
probably
wont
finish
this
beer
working
on
it
now
i
tried
a
chili
beer
at
the
dam
brewery
in
dillon
colorado
over
the
summer
so
i
know
that
the
style
can
be
much
better
this
was
horrible
drinks
i
wouldnt
know
i
allowed
just
two
sips
the
first
to
judge
taste
and
a
valiant
second
to
get
the
mouthfeel
the
rest
ended
up
in
my
drain
hopefully
finding
some
use
as
a
pipe
cleaner
overall
their
website
claims
that
lime
is
for
wimps
an
obvious
diss
on
corona
which
is
brewed
just
south
of
the
border
and
obviously
in
more
demand
than
this
foul
brew
corona
with
lime
tastes
foul
enough
but
with
a
chilli
in
it
it
went
from
bad
to
so
bad
its
good
i
decided
i
did
not
have
enough
punishment
and
ordered
another
one
just
to
completely
incinerate
my
innards
i
have
never
gone
near
that
beer
since
drank
out
of
the
bottle
with
best
before
date
of
112410
on
the
bottle
golden
yellow
hue
to
the
brew
i
drank
this
cold
with
the
serano
pepper
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
no
real
scent
but
the
spice
of
the
pepper
takes
over
the
flavor
of
the
beer
the
warming
nature
of
the
pepper
taste
warms
both
throat
and
belly
it
is
interesting
but
certainly
not
really
refreshing
d
none
doesnt
taste
good
and
is
too
hot
and
i
like
hot
food
im
dumping
this
overall
this
was
an
awesomely
bad
beer
if
someone
really
loved
peppers
and
needed
them
in
a
liquid
beer
format
than
this
would
probably
be
right
up
their
alley
otherwise
this
beer
is
good
for
a
few
laughs
and
thats
about
all
worth
picking
up
for
a
party
or
to
share
with
friendsenemies
d
after
3
sips
the
novelty
wore
off
chile
is
just
overpowering
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
with
very
little
head
and
that
practically
disappears
instantly
the
smell
is
akin
to
a
whiff
of
a
jalapenoladen
salad
the
peppers
taking
the
van
whilst
plenty
of
greens
march
from
behind
the
taste
begins
with
a
vague
pale
wheatiness
with
no
real
character
kinda
like
an
mgd
this
is
followed
by
a
fairly
strong
pepper
burn
that
oertakes
any
other
flavors
and
then
after
malingering
for
a
bit
takes
off
to
parts
unknown
leaving
nothing
but
scorched
earth
in
its
wake
the
body
is
surprisingly
kinda
medium
a
bit
hefty
if
you
ask
me
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
death
valleystyle
finish
this
plus
the
offputtingly
unbalanced
heat
bog
the
drinkability
down
somewhere
in
the
desert
taste
follows
the
aroma
balanced
but
generic
until
the
pepper
burn
comes
on
at
the
end
actually
dont
find
the
pepper
as
repulsive
as
most
mouthfeel
is
thin
aftertaste
is
moderate
burn
and
drinkability
is
not
good
i
wont
look
for
again
but
ill
finish
this
one
as
a
rite
of
passage
i
gave
the
glass
to
my
housemate
who
also
thought
it
was
abhorrent
d
do
you
like
spice
and
not
much
else
if
so
this
is
really
not
that
bad
no
its
not
complex
no
you
probably
wouldnt
serve
this
at
a
fancy
lobster
dinner
with
the
pope
but
for
a
novelty
item
its
kind
of
good
and
even
a
little
refreshing
i
wish
i
had
some
tacos
or
nachos
or
something
to
eat
with
it
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
not
for
me
lets
get
back
to
real
craft
beer
ok
reflecting
on
this
beer
its
bad
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
though
im
not
too
sure
what
i
expected
definitely
an
experience
however
i
can
see
this
being
useful
in
a
good
beerbattered
fish
fry
recipelike
a
spicy
twist
on
it
otherwise
avoid
unless
you
are
a
masochist
or
want
to
play
mean
jokes
on
people
not
drinkable
at
all
beer
meet
drain
the
beer
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
jalapeno
juice
with
some
corn
adjuncts
the
flavor
is
sweet
corn
with
a
jalapeno
burn
in
the
aftertaste
strong
heat
in
the
back
of
the
throat
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
not
very
drinkable
since
its
pretty
gross
and
the
spicyness
is
bound
to
upset
the
stomach
after
2
at
the
most
id
say
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
if
only
so
i
will
never
be
curious
about
it
or
buy
it
again
though
i
may
like
to
try
dogfish
heads
theobroma
which
has
received
decent
reviews
on
here
nevertheless
this
chile
beer
makes
me
crave
a
thick
chocolate
stout
this
thing
is
quite
the
experience
as
for
the
pepper
its
bland
leathery
and
unpleasant
poured
clear
light
amber
with
no
head
and
minimal
lacing
heavy
green
chili
aroma
light
body
with
a
thin
texture
and
soft
carbonation
hot
chili
flavor
with
a
hot
chili
finish
of
moderate
duration
interesting
for
one
drink
so
i
poured
the
rest
out
dthere
really
isnt
much
drinkablility
the
pepper
just
overpowered
everything
i
just
dont
see
anyone
enjoying
more
than
one
of
these
i
tried
this
beer
to
try
a
chili
beer
and
to
me
seems
the
only
reason
why
you
would
want
a
drink
that
actually
makes
your
mouth
hot
it
defeats
the
purpose
of
a
drink
for
real
anyone
who
likes
this
beer
has
my
full
respect
you
are
way
tougher
than
i
could
ever
be
hey
i
like
hot
sauce
on
just
about
everything
im
talking
pizza
eggs
fried
chicken
hamburgers
you
name
it
but
evidently
not
in
my
beer
the
taste
lingers
so
i
imagine
if
you
like
the
flavor
you
will
love
it
if
you
do
not
then
you
wont
love
it
i
fall
in
the
later
category
overall
no
suprises
here
this
is
an
abomination
of
a
beverage
i
might
have
a
better
chance
at
choking
down
battery
acid
i
could
see
cooking
chili
and
pouring
it
in
for
flavor
this
is
its
one
and
only
redeeming
quality
i
would
drink
it
again
but
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
also
considering
my
tastes
i
would
not
offer
it
to
someone
else
for
it
seems
that
spicy
foodsdrinks
that
i
enjoy
others
do
not
enjoy
because
it
is
too
spicy
or
they
do
not
like
spicy
foods
maybe
i
should
find
new
friends
just
kidding
to
be
honest
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
but
on
any
regular
scale
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
regular
an
average
brew
though
different
in
that
the
chili
brewed
lager
is
fairly
spicy
and
i
mean
hot
spicy
not
spice
spicy
it
is
very
similar
to
most
average
mexican
brews
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
like
beers
of
this
sort
usually
are
it
was
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
and
was
surprisingly
different
from
anything
ive
ever
tried
im
a
huge
fan
of
spicy
food
so
this
was
something
that
had
to
be
experienced
not
quite
as
spicy
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
as
it
is
on
the
back
and
in
the
throat
not
sure
if
this
beer
could
be
drank
all
night
as
i
have
never
tried
and
only
had
a
six
pack
that
was
drank
one
at
a
time
on
different
occasions
not
for
the
weak
hearted
or
weak
stomached
smell
is
nothing
to
speak
of
but
the
flavor
tells
a
slightly
different
tale
i
actually
tried
eating
the
chili
after
drinking
the
brew
but
the
beer
must
have
taken
all
the
flavor
out
of
the
chili
and
it
had
really
no
taste
almost
a
waxy
fakelike
flavor
try
it
if
youre
not
too
timid
but
dont
expect
anything
truly
amazing
d
i
dont
know
anyone
that
would
enjoy
this
this
is
breaking
the
law
im
sorry
but
i
cant
do
this
this
is
strictly
an
experimental
beer
do
not
buy
more
than
one
at
a
time
unless
you
are
going
to
use
it
to
hand
out
to
your
friends
or
more
appropriately
enemies
congratulations
on
putting
a
chilli
in
a
bottle
cave
creek
feel
free
to
brew
a
beer
next
time
overall
im
really
not
impressed
for
me
this
was
a
drain
pour
by
far
my
favorite
aspect
of
this
beer
was
biting
into
the
chili
pepper
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
watching
beer
fizz
out
of
the
tip
amusing
but
not
a
good
beer
what
a
dichotomous
beer
im
not
sure
ive
ever
given
such
wildly
varying
scores
for
the
different
elements
it
makes
me
think
that
the
pleasant
elements
are
really
just
random
fluctuations
and
the
beer
is
not
terribly
good
overall
interesting
sure
unique
undeniably
drinkable
not
a
chance
i
picked
this
up
at
an
ultra
modern
publix
with
a
huge
organic
selection
i
seem
the
average
grade
of
a
d
but
i
love
this
beer
call
me
weird
poured
the
average
corona
pale
gold
with
no
head
big
deal
smell
was
mild
chili
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
was
nice
and
spicey
just
the
way
i
like
it
but
not
overbearing
and
mostly
chili
with
the
mexican
beer
taste
in
the
background
i
like
this
better
than
rogues
chipotle
ale
sorry
guys
im
going
to
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
this
one
this
is
not
to
say
that
it
is
a
totally
nonredeemable
beer
i
would
just
appreciate
a
few
sips
then
let
it
be
and
pass
the
bottle
drinkability
ha
i
struggled
to
finish
this
one
but
even
if
you
were
to
make
the
statement
that
only
people
who
like
spicy
foods
would
take
this
it
didnt
take
me
and
i
grew
up
on
indian
food
p
s
you
should
give
this
beer
a
try
someday
just
so
you
know
what
i
am
talking
about
drinkability
is
null
this
shit
is
heartburn
city
ill
never
drink
it
again
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
head
no
retention
or
laceing
aroma
is
of
hot
peppers
and
salsa
body
is
thin
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
pretty
one
dimentionalchili
chili
and
more
chili
little
bit
of
a
light
lager
comes
through
as
well
never
had
this
style
before
but
it
was
intresting
i
like
hot
and
spiceybut
would
caution
against
this
if
you
dont
worth
a
try
just
for
fun
i
enjoyed
the
novelty
of
this
beer
but
overall
it
was
just
a
little
too
wierd
and
gross
for
me
and
the
last
bit
of
beer
was
poured
down
the
drain
the
pour
was
typical
in
appearance
to
mexican
lagers
pale
yellow
and
headless
i
really
liked
the
heat
from
the
chili
pepper
however
that
is
the
only
high
point
of
this
beer
for
me
i
like
the
idea
of
this
but
wish
the
foundation
was
better
than
some
cheap
mexican
lager
i
would
even
like
this
better
using
something
like
budweiser
that
while
not
having
a
lot
of
taste
is
at
least
very
drinkable
having
said
that
i
found
the
perfect
combo
for
this
beer
pour
a
couple
inches
of
clamato
into
your
glass
followed
by
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
and
yumo
as
rachel
ray
would
say
at
least
i
can
say
i
tried
it
not
something
id
actively
seek
out
to
drink
though
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
a
pepper
beer
although
i
have
been
a
bit
apprehensive
about
it
i
like
beer
and
i
like
spicy
food
but
im
not
sure
if
they
belong
in
the
same
container
i
did
not
notice
the
chili
pepper
in
the
bottle
when
i
purchased
it
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
typical
mexican
beer
head
nonexistant
it
is
a
clear
pale
yellow
like
a
lager
i
smells
like
peppers
it
tastes
like
lager
with
some
heat
i
am
kind
of
surprised
at
the
spiciness
this
is
the
reason
i
dont
drink
corona
if
you
have
to
add
a
fruit
or
vegetable
to
a
beer
it
really
isnt
drinkable
overall
it
is
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
but
still
not
good
i
wasnt
sure
how
to
rate
since
this
is
my
first
experience
so
i
may
have
went
a
little
too
easy
on
it
overall
thanks
to
my
buddy
ph
for
getting
me
this
definitely
a
shock
factor
i
have
never
seen
a
chili
pepper
in
a
beer
before
however
catchy
it
certainly
does
not
have
the
taste
of
a
proper
beer
all
i
get
from
this
is
perhaps
a
malt
liquor
flavor
without
the
alcohol
and
tabasco
sauce
so
basically
a
macro
adjunct
lager
with
hot
sauce
its
quite
the
gag
gift
but
for
enjoyment
i
think
you
need
a
certain
palate
that
most
people
do
not
have
definitely
interesting
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
pint
of
beer
not
the
least
bit
drinkable
maybe
in
the
right
setting
like
a
tasting
with
a
lot
of
mexican
food
have
no
idea
how
people
buy
a
case
of
this
but
saw
about
10
piled
up
at
shangys
the
other
day
and
this
shocked
me
almost
as
much
as
the
beer
itself
d
this
beer
goes
overboard
in
almost
every
way
you
would
have
to
love
chilis
with
every
ounce
of
passion
in
your
body
to
drink
this
stuff
might
actually
be
decent
if
there
wasnt
a
whole
damn
pepper
in
the
bottle
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
because
i
have
a
feeling
its
not
worth
dirtying
a
glass
looks
like
a
cheap
adjunct
lager
but
this
one
happens
to
have
a
pepper
in
it
smells
like
really
cheap
bad
beer
with
a
hint
of
pepper
tastes
like
watered
down
hot
sauce
with
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
hot
not
very
drinkable
at
all
this
is
definitely
a
drain
pour
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
its
about
what
i
expected
this
beer
would
be
great
for
a
prank
this
beer
pours
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
the
head
is
really
fizz
and
goes
away
the
second
i
am
done
pouring
it
the
color
of
the
beer
is
golden
but
it
really
doesnt
look
like
beer
the
aroma
is
tobasco
sauce
very
unbeery
the
taste
is
awful
in
the
strongest
sense
of
the
word
it
is
like
drinking
a
bottle
of
tobasco
sauce
the
mouthfeel
is
like
that
of
a
soda
fizzy
and
light
overall
i
tried
this
beeer
because
i
wanted
to
know
if
it
was
as
bad
as
my
fellow
bas
have
said
they
were
right
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
in
fact
this
is
the
worst
thing
i
have
ever
drank
ever
this
poured
a
clear
light
gold
color
with
no
head
it
smelled
predominantly
like
chili
peppers
with
some
cultured
yeast
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
it
tasted
very
spicy
with
jalapeno
and
green
chili
flavors
along
with
a
bit
of
sweet
yeast
it
was
a
bit
thin
and
sticky
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
an
overly
hot
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
was
great
just
kidding
it
was
terrible
it
was
definitely
unique
and
true
to
its
name
but
was
really
difficult
to
drink
it
was
over
the
top
spicy
and
the
other
ingredients
were
cheap
and
unbalanced
i
didnt
care
for
the
mouthfeel
either
and
ultimately
barely
finished
the
bottle
i
agree
that
this
might
make
a
funny
gag
gift
but
its
barely
even
worth
trying
for
the
novelty
and
its
certainly
a
beer
i
wont
ever
drink
again
niiki
given
to
me
by
my
local
beer
store
owner
what
a
mess
this
is
no
idea
why
you
would
drink
except
for
novelty
12
ounce
bottle
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
no
head
aroma
is
straight
peppers
nothing
else
taste
is
really
hot
i
guess
thats
what
theyre
going
for
but
its
ridiculous
and
i
couldnt
take
it
seriously
good
gag
gift
thats
about
it
i
was
worried
about
getting
a
disease
while
drinking
this
and
while
i
dont
mind
dying
slowly
from
alcohol
intake
id
rather
not
have
it
be
from
a
single
crap
beer
seriously
i
cant
think
of
one
good
thing
to
write
about
this
drink
not
a
single
one
i
can
only
hope
that
those
reading
this
will
not
make
the
same
mistake
i
made
original
c
cave
creek
chili
beer
cerveza
con
chili
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
with
a
chili
pepper
floating
in
it
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
chili
pepper
the
flavor
is
more
heat
than
flavor
in
all
fairness
this
beer
tastes
just
like
a
chili
pepper
not
just
heat
but
thats
all
it
tastes
like
this
is
really
a
bad
beer
it
ended
up
being
a
drain
pour
even
though
four
of
us
tried
to
drink
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
and
couldnt
manage
it
its
purely
a
novelty
rather
than
a
drinkable
beer
d
never
never
again
i
refuse
to
drain
pour
a
beer
just
because
i
personally
think
its
a
little
silly
im
a
little
tight
with
my
money
so
if
beer
is
there
its
gonna
get
drunk
if
i
would
have
drank
this
on
my
own
who
knows
the
sick
feeling
i
got
from
this
beer
resting
in
my
belly
lasted
for
quite
a
while
and
pretty
much
cut
me
off
that
night
if
i
would
have
drank
another
beer
i
would
have
become
quite
queezy
i
think
not
the
best
experience
not
something
i
would
want
to
order
more
than
one
of
but
not
bad
so
this
beer
is
bad
to
drink
but
will
spice
up
your
chili
recipe
it
is
what
it
is
a
novelty
beer
a
onetrick
pony
ive
had
worse
beers
try
eating
some
fresh
jalapeño
while
swigging
a
lager
its
virtually
the
same
just
hybridized
into
beer
form
maybe
a
510
on
the
heat
scale
it
didnt
even
make
my
eyes
water
what
i
was
afraid
of
was
buildup
of
residual
heat
but
it
didnt
really
go
down
that
way
thankfully
thanks
to
jr
for
this
one
i
just
think
it
tastes
like
recycled
drain
water
with
a
pepper
in
it
drinkability
not
so
hot
do
i
even
need
to
say
why
once
off
novelties
are
never
drinkable
but
this
one
is
particularly
foul
firmly
strongly
and
intensely
not
recommended
m
d
i
cant
not
drink
it
i
can
deal
with
drinking
it
without
puking
i
suppose
but
i
dunno
why
id
really
want
to
its
just
not
a
good
beer
unfortunately
in
time
for
me
to
want
to
take
another
sip
then
another
i
accompanied
the
beer
with
lime
tortilla
chips
and
wow
the
serrano
chili
inside
the
bottle
was
quite
nice
as
well
i
guess
i
would
say
this
is
definitley
a
food
beer
and
also
would
make
for
wonderful
marinades
and
defintily
the
best
bloody
maria
ever
definitley
warming
just
in
time
for
winter
not
as
bad
as
i
had
thought
interesting
gimmick
probably
wont
ever
have
it
again
drinkability
is
incredibly
low
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
not
very
good
and
it
is
definitely
overwhelming
i
cant
see
sitting
down
and
drinking
the
whole
bottle
comfortably
i
have
used
it
as
a
marinade
in
the
past
and
that
seems
to
work
just
fine
overall
ok
so
not
a
horrible
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
either
taste
like
a
corona
with
a
jalapeno
in
it
not
something
id
buy
again
unless
i
was
buying
it
for
novelty
purposes
oh
my
this
beer
looks
like
a
standard
mexican
lage
complete
with
a
lack
of
head
but
all
similarities
end
there
it
probably
would
be
light
and
crisp
but
the
taste
is
so
totally
and
completely
dominated
by
jalapeno
pepper
that
youd
never
know
think
carbonated
mild
hot
sauce
but
you
cant
really
complain
i
mean
you
pretty
much
know
what
youre
in
for
from
the
getgo
this
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
when
you
see
a
chili
pepper
floating
in
a
beer
bottle
this
is
you
typical
lager
kicked
up
with
the
addition
of
chili
its
a
little
like
getting
a
beer
and
a
salad
all
in
one
shot
thats
if
you
can
get
the
chili
out
of
the
bottle
overall
i
would
pick
this
up
again
if
the
mood
hit
me
but
be
ready
for
the
hottness
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
actually
i
didnt
keep
it
in
my
mouth
long
enough
to
get
a
good
feel
for
it
drinkability
very
tasty
however
after
two
you
wouldnt
really
want
to
drink
more
because
of
the
spice
to
it
the
only
real
use
i
have
found
for
it
is
marinating
steaks
and
fajita
meat
has
a
good
tenderizing
ability
and
really
flavors
the
meat
it
is
in
the
cooking
realm
i
see
this
beer
having
its
place
this
beer
seems
to
be
getting
alot
of
bad
reviews
personally
i
like
spicy
foods
and
i
enjoy
this
beer
if
you
do
not
like
spicy
food
i
would
not
recommend
drinking
this
beer
if
you
do
not
like
jalapeños
i
also
would
not
recommend
this
beer
everyone
has
a
different
taste
but
for
me
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
mouthfeel
was
average
for
a
cheap
lager
drinkability
is
low
its
a
gimmick
beer
you
either
want
to
belt
down
fizzy
yellow
beers
on
a
hot
day
or
drink
something
good
this
doesnt
fit
either
niche
drinkability
avoid
the
most
frightening
words
ever
spoken
that
wasnt
a
chili
pepper
it
is
sort
of
sad
that
crazy
ed
probably
wont
ever
brew
this
one
himself
again
but
such
is
the
plight
of
small
business
so
theres
a
serrano
pepper
in
here
and
damn
thats
definitely
the
prevailing
scent
serrano
and
corn
chips
is
how
i
would
best
describe
it
theres
not
much
taste
to
be
had
with
this
one
because
whatever
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
its
almost
entirely
masked
by
the
chili
burn
i
get
the
novelty
of
the
product
i
suppose
imagine
modelo
especial
or
sol
only
throw
some
canned
jalapenos
with
a
touch
of
the
juice
in
there
and
youve
got
the
idea
yeah
its
really
not
pleasant
about
three
sips
did
it
for
me
and
then
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
the
burn
in
my
mouth
took
a
surprisingly
long
time
to
go
away
not
anything
id
buy
again
but
if
people
want
it
so
much
ill
carry
it
at
the
store
if
only
for
the
novelty
factor
oelergud
im
gonna
stop
there
as
my
first
draft
got
eaten
by
the
gremlins
of
the
digital
universe
accidentally
closed
my
browser
and
ive
had
to
retype
this
whole
thing
aargh
back
to
the
drawing
board
for
this
one
overall
except
for
the
aroma
this
beer
is
a
complete
fail
im
hoping
it
was
a
bad
bottle
i
will
have
to
talk
to
the
guys
at
viking
about
this
one
well
worth
a
try
for
those
who
enjoy
spicy
brews
decent
on
drinkability
probably
the
hottest
beer
ive
had
as
the
cayenne
presence
is
impressive
but
still
this
one
is
a
bit
messy
and
unbalanced
d
this
was
not
enjoyable
to
me
it
was
pretty
much
a
drain
pour
d
not
good
at
all
i
thought
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
given
the
other
poor
reviews
i
dont
think
that
is
the
case
this
may
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
guess
there
is
a
reason
why
this
brewery
stays
below
the
radar
here
on
ba
lets
just
hope
the
swedish
imperial
stout
is
a
little
better
d
very
interesting
beer
from
viking
if
they
toned
down
the
spice
a
little
and
dialed
up
the
mouthfeel
and
chocolatemalty
flavours
i
think
they
would
have
something
special
on
their
hands
black
in
color
with
light
chocolate
colored
head
the
nose
is
malty
and
dull
i
know
about
what
is
coming
due
to
the
brewed
with
cocoa
and
cayenne
pepper
statement
on
the
label
i
am
bracing
myself
for
an
all
or
nothing
type
of
experience
the
attack
is
smooth
with
a
chocolate
and
malt
forward
presentation
the
cayenne
presents
late
and
gains
heat
as
it
finishes
in
the
mouth
it
is
like
a
runner
sprinting
for
the
finish
line
the
way
the
intensity
grows
the
beer
is
very
different
but
very
good
back
to
my
statement
of
it
being
all
or
nothing
this
beer
is
a
lot
more
all
than
nothing
pours
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
aroma
consists
of
cocoa
powder
chocolate
malt
caramel
toffee
and
some
vinous
notes
medium
in
body
dark
chocolate
malt
dominates
the
flavor
profile
its
not
bitter
though
rich
chocolate
midway
almost
reminds
me
of
devils
food
cake
but
not
as
sweet
pepper
heat
really
hits
you
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
lingers
into
the
finish
for
a
few
seconds
as
such
it
warms
the
back
and
roof
of
your
mouth
i
really
like
this
as
a
winter
offering
this
is
better
than
i
expected
not
great
but
decent
and
interesting
it
went
just
fine
with
my
taco
salad
d
just
ok
could
drink
several
more
but
the
combo
of
beer
and
spicy
aftertaste
is
generally
not
for
me
i
usually
always
give
good
scores
for
appearance
so
this
is
the
exception
it
looks
piss
poor
no
head
particulateladen
brown
swamp
it
smells
like
chocolate
and
chile
powder
the
taste
is
cocoa
powder
and
pepper
its
not
gross
but
i
dont
really
care
for
the
pairing
of
chocolate
and
pepper
sweet
and
dense
chocolate
flavors
with
a
building
peppery
cayenne
spice
in
the
finish
well
integrated
the
chile
isnt
too
intense
more
akin
to
adding
a
pinch
of
pepper
to
liven
up
a
dish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
slightly
dunkelish
but
this
can
be
overlooked
due
to
the
tasty
flavor
overall
i
like
this
and
would
drink
a
couple
at
a
time
this
is
great
stuff
if
you
like
a
little
chile
heat
in
your
cocoa
points
for
creativity
chiles
and
chocolate
isnt
that
big
of
a
stretch
really
thanks
to
fellow
ba
roger
for
sharing
this
bottle
with
mepoured
deep
and
dark
but
not
quite
opaque
with
a
thinner
mocha
colored
head
a
bit
of
pepper
spice
and
bitter
chocolate
in
the
nose
but
the
aromas
are
on
the
lighter
sidei
like
the
flavors
of
this
beer
alot
more
than
most
i
think
it
starts
out
roasted
with
bitter
chocolate
tones
melding
into
a
big
spicey
finish
and
i
mean
its
pretty
spicey
hey
i
liked
it
it
delivered
a
good
combination
of
flavors
and
packed
a
kicki
would
drink
again
i
like
viking
i
think
they
take
some
chances
hit
or
miss
this
beer
pours
with
a
stoutlike
appearance
litte
head
retention
aromas
of
malt
hit
the
nose
no
peppery
aromas
the
taste
is
exactly
the
name
of
the
beer
hot
chocolate
somewhat
smooth
taste
with
a
finish
of
peppery
spicniness
the
cayenne
pepper
perhaps
a
unique
beer
that
could
pass
as
a
digestif
definitely
not
a
beer
for
sports
events
and
the
light
beer
crowd
the
more
i
drank
this
beer
the
more
spicy
heat
from
the
cayenne
pepper
coated
and
remained
in
my
throat
a
little
too
much
i
like
this
beer
theres
a
smoothness
to
it
that
is
nicely
contrasted
with
the
peppery
hottness
of
the
cayenne
also
the
maltiness
really
i
like
the
way
this
turned
out
a
bit
of
a
problem
with
head
retention
and
lace
but
wth
nice
n
dark
very
chocolatey
silky
nice
finish
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
almost
no
head
nose
is
coffee
with
some
slight
chocolate
notes
flavor
is
mocha
a
tad
bitter
with
a
very
nice
heated
finish
from
the
cayenne
kept
on
drinking
this
as
i
was
enjoying
the
heat
in
the
back
i
also
detected
some
cherry
mixed
in
with
the
chocolate
which
was
very
nice
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
maybe
be
a
bit
thin
for
some
but
for
me
it
was
a
medium
to
get
some
chile
pepper
heat
which
i
am
quite
fond
of
thanks
to
jeffkrenner
for
this
bottle
d
a
very
interesting
beer
spiciness
is
really
cool
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
habanero
mango
ice
cream
i
had
recently
not
very
drinkable
but
my
limited
experience
with
chili
beers
hasnt
led
me
to
one
that
was
this
one
has
potential
perhaps
their
cayenne
pepper
wasnt
at
its
best
will
take
some
decent
reviews
of
a
new
batch
to
pique
my
interest
in
this
brew
again
pours
a
blackbrown
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
chocolate
cake
batter
with
a
faint
hint
of
chile
powder
the
taste
is
much
more
powerful
than
the
aroma
with
a
straight
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
chocolate
that
seems
to
cling
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
the
chile
outlasts
everything
else
leaving
a
satisfying
finish
its
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
like
which
is
unusual
for
viking
i
let
it
warm
up
quite
a
bit
id
shoot
for
about
55
deg
its
a
great
concept
matching
chile
with
chocolate
and
viking
pulls
it
off
hot
chocolate
kinda
sorta
sounds
like
a
good
idea
but
it
has
to
be
done
just
right
viking
has
added
way
too
much
cayenne
pepper
and
has
ruined
things
as
a
result
frankly
this
beer
is
a
mess
and
is
a
new
low
point
for
a
brewery
that
struggles
to
provide
high
points
on
any
given
day
originally
reviewed

bottle
at
the
gitchee
gumee
brewfest
2005
this
beer
pours
a
peculiar
milky
brown
almost
like
molten
caramel
the
aroma
is
stingy
and
heavily
tannic
but
a
little
sweet
and
floral
the
flavor
starts
off
somewhat
rounded
and
chocolately
but
then
i
get
blasted
by
this
bland
hot
spice
that
speaks
slightly
of
roasted
pepper
im
not
pleased
i
dont
like
hot
things
in
my
beer
nobody
has
executed
a
hot
pepper
beer
that
shows
balance
or
melds
with
beers
other
characteristics
and
this
is
not
that
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
with
really
mellow
carbonation
almost
seems
still
in
the
glass
halfway
through
this
is
not
a
chile
beer
that
ill
be
picking
up
again
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
at
all
maybe
youll
have
a
different
opinion
pours
a
two

dark

head
that
fades
instantly
leaving
no
lace
black
color
faint
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
chocolate

oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
deep
brown
color
bordering
on
black
with
a
very
small
head
that
leaves
only
small
wisps
over
top
no
bubbles
appear
to
be
working
their
way
to
the
surface
on
this
one
aroma
is
pretty
well
all
cocoa
comes
across
pretty
lifeless
and
could
definately
use
some
more
to
it
flavor
is
right
there
with
the
cocoa
but
this
fades
to
a
nice
coffee
and
chocolate
finish
on
the
second
sip
i
start
to
get
the
pepper
on
this
one
it
gives
an
itial
tingle
of
heat
and
pepper
flavor
the
heat
hits
the
back
of
my
throat
and
my
stomach
as
a
pretty
harsh
burn
after
two
sips
the
pepper
flavor
is
really
all
that
i
am
getting
from
this
one
not
really
enjoy
it
mouthfeel
is
a
thin
moderate
with
an
absence
of
carbonation
im
not
enjoying
the
burning
sensation
in
my
esophagus
and
stomach
i
just
dont
think
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
heartburn
in
a
bottle
looks
ok
no
head
to
speak
of
but
its
really
dark
im
mean
truly
impenetrably
dark
thats
cool
smells
pretty
decent
like
peppers
and
chocolate
the
taste
however
bleigh
typically
viking
yeast
and
barley
flavors
with
plenty
of
nice
wellhot
chocolate
flavors
too
bad
the
pepper
is
misplaced
unbalanced
and
nearly
undrinkable
im
not
saying
that
this
beer
is
all
that
hot
its
not
i
just
dont
like
the
particular
pepper
that
they
used
i
dont
care
for
the
flavor
and
boy
did
they
ever
use
a
lot
of
it
you
can
see
pepper
flakes
floating
around
in
there
tons
of
the
stuff
body
is
way
too
light
this
seems
connected
to
the
head
thing
carbonation
is
minimal
and
the
beer
seems
watered
down
i
really
like
viking
brewery
especially
their
experimental
stuff
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
by
yards
dark
chocolate
black
with
a
bubbly
quicklydisappearing
cocoa
brown
head
syrupy
chocolate
sweetness
cocoa
powder
baking
backed
by
roastedness
and
nostrilburning
heat
im
not
kidding
weird
sweet
chocolate
milk
sweetness
like
a
sweet
stout
light
roastedness
a
strange
hot
spiciness
descends
into
the
finish
chili
mixed
with
chocolate
eh
weird
but
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
fullbodied
with
a
syrupy
cloying
feel
light
carbonation
all
add
up
for
an
odd
feel
not
for
mass
consumption
pours
a
jet
black
with
no
head
and
very
very
little
carbonation
after
tasting
a
variety
of
vikings
beers
this
comes
as
no
surprise
cmon
guys
wheres
the
carbonation
coffee
liqueur
dominates
the
aroma
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
spiceheat
or
nicotine
and
maybe
just
maybe
some
chocolate
the
taste
is
smokey
spicy
and
devoid
of
chocolate
another
reviewer
said
that
this
tasted
like
an
ashtry
and
i
cant
get
that
out
of
my
mind
the
taste
is
just
plain
weird
im
not
opposed
to
a
mix
of
chocolate
and
peppers
but
the
pepper
dominates
and
quite
frankly
the
pepper
flavor
isnt
that
good
id
like
to
see
more
chocolate
and
less
perhaps
different
pepper
flavor
mouthfeel
is
average
though
i
think
id
like
it
better
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
this
isnt
terribly
drinkable
i
have
a
fourpack
and
i
suspect
that
the
last
two
will
sit
in
the
cellar
for
a
bit
looks
pretty
weird
an
almost
completely
flat
pitch
black
color
with
odd
brown
seedlooking
flecks
floating
around
in
it
smells
great
though
really
strongly
of
chocolate
and
stoutish
roasted
coffee
with
just
the
barest
hint
of
spicy
pepper
tastes
fairly
lowkey
not
boisterously
chocolatey
or
peppery
but
theres
definitely
some
of
both
and
i
disagree
with
previous
reviewers
that
these
two
flavors
clash
horribly
theres
a
caramel
malt
base
with
rich
chocolate
and
roasted
veins
running
through
it
and
a
spicyness
that
builds
as
the
stout
characteristics
taper
the
beers
two
main
flavors
are
inversely
related
and
it
transforms
from
a
tasty
chocolate
stout
with
flashes
of
hotness
into
a
peppery
beer
with
some
lingering
hints
of
chocolate
both
within
a
sip
and
as
the
beer
warms
the
drinkability
takes
a
hit
as
the
bottle
goes
on
due
to
the
cayenne
but
still
hot
chocolate
was
much
better
than
i
expected
pours
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
lots
of
yeast
clumpies
floating
around
and
what
looks
like
the
bottom
of
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
on
the
inside
of
the
bottle
no
head
i
really
mean
that
not
a
trace
of
head
smell
is
of
chocolate
maybe
a
little
chili
spice
but
maybe
it
is
just
me
trying
to
place
it
there
taste
is
terrible
the
cocoa
flavors
do
not
mix
well
with
the
chili
giving
it
a
smokeyashtray
flavor
this
reminds
me
of
the
flavor
in
your
mouth
after
vomiting
the
acidity
i
love
hot
food
put
tabasco
on
a
minimum
of
2
meals
a
day
however
this
absolutely
abhorred
not
good
at
all
oh
yeah
and
the
mouthfeel
has
lackluster
carbonation
blechl
one
is
probably
enough
though
i
was
expecting
the
worst
and
i
got
mediocer
which
i
consider
a
win
considering
the
style
in
terms
of
its
base
beer
its
decent
and
actually
quite
easy
to
drink
the
color
is
a
besmirched
blackened
brown
muddy
thing
that
pours
very
thin
and
without
much
head
or
carbonation
aroma
has
weakened
cocoalike
nuttyness
with
a
small
hint
to
the
cayenne
oh
but
the
flavor
does
not
mistake
where
the
cayenne
is
its
smack
dab
in
your
face
and
absolutely
disgusting
i
cant
imagine
the
look
on
my
face
i
must
of
had
after
the
first
sip
i
must
of
looked
like
i
was
poisined
or
something
i
nearly
gagged
it
was
that
bad
for
me
its
suppose
to
be
a
chocolate
stout
with
cayenne
seasoning
not
cayenne
bludgeoning
the
chocolate
is
nearly
invisible
and
what
is
detetced
is
very
artificial
and
stale
it
doesnt
help
that
it
nearly
does
nothing
but
sit
like
water
the
body
is
super
thin
and
weak
and
all
i
get
is
a
bunch
of
nasty
cayenne
that
never
fits
yuk
yuk
yuk
viking
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
to
me
i
so
enjoy
a
couple
of
their
beers
but
this
along
with
countless
others
are
just
soooo
out
there
that
its
time
to
do
a
reality
check
and
get
back
to
the
basics
of
making
a
finely
crafted
brew
not
some
basement
science
project
gone
horribly
wrong
that
will
rise
up
to
destroy
its
maker
another
weird
idea
from
viking
bafflingly
executed
pours
to
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
light
brown
head
that
diminishes
almost
instantly
typical
with
viking
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
i
am
seaching
for
the
peppers
in
the
aroma
and
they
just
are
not
there
the
flavor
is
chocolate
and
malt
in
the
front
which
then
flows
to
a
fresh
peppery
taste
it
is
very
thin
and
watery
and
the
peppers
have
a
bit
of
warmth
in
the
finish
it
needs
some
more
carbonation
kinda
flat
im
a
big
spicy
food
fan
so
i
like
it
hot
this
isnt
as
hot
as
i
was
expecting
needs
more
pepper
in
the
aroma
and
the
chocolate
and
pepper
heat
in
the
flavor
this
headless
black
beer
leaves
no
lace
the
aroma
is
more
cocoa
than
chile
the
flavor
however
is
more
chile
than
cocoa
a
lot
more
chile
this
one
is
hot
damn
it
lingers
its
an
interesting
brew
but
not
one
id
revisit
anytime
soon
just
not
my
kind
of
beer
this
brew
comes
in
a
sixpack
rather
than
the
typical
large
bottle
kind
of
unfortunate
in
that
its
not
the
most
drinkable
brew
from
a
brewery
with
a
lot
of
odd
entries
anyway
a
chocolate
stout
with
cayenne
seasoning
dark
pour
head
is
middling
and
leaving
just
traces
of
lace
aroma
is
lighlty
malty
some
buttery
tones
and
traces
of
the
cayenne
pepper
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
underdone
and
the
flavor
just
doesnt
get
a
lot
of
foothold
in
the
chocolate
arena
before
the
pepper
becomes
very
hot
and
dominates
the
beer
lingering
aftertaste
not
the
most
strident
chile
beer
maybe
a
different
idea
than
others
and
it
is
an
interesting
transition
now
i
have
five
more
and
i
cant
think
of
other
occasions
id
want
to
consume
them
i
dont
have
the
most
refined
pallet
in
the
world
but
i
really
found
the
taste
disorienting
not
in
a
particularly
bad
way
however
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
in
a
can
honestly
a
can
is
better
definitely
taste
the
cumin
interesting
beer
brewed
with
hatch
chile
and
pulls
it
off
i
was
expecting
something
more
like
spicy
chocolate
because
of
the
smell
it
gives
off
but
the
taste
was
like
a
watered
down
chipotle
stout
i
dont
really
recommend
it
more
points
to
ska
for
crafting
a
stout
that
stands
out
from
the
pack
and
though
it
is
experimental
this
is
easily
the
best
of
its
kind
ive
ever
had
will
enjoy
again
yes
the
ink
black
color
is
something
to
look
at
though
if
youre
expecting
a
head
look
quick
because
is
dissipates
very
quickly
the
pleasant
aroma
tickles
the
nose
is
spicy
hatch
chiles
and
cocoa
its
delicious
to
say
the
least
not
overspiced
nor
weak
in
fact
it
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
xocoveza
and
those
cinnamon
chile
and
brown
sugar
notes
really
turn
me
on
its
in
between
light
and
medium
bodied
and
despite
fuzzy
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
meeting
again
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
chocolate
and
cinnamon
dominate
the
aroma
and
flavor
with
accents
of
dark
fruit
and
chili
pepper
very
good
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
is
deep
black
only
slightly
brighter
around
the
edges
a
frothy
mocha
head
forms
and
then
completely
disappears
almost
immediately
i
caught
a
ton
of
varied
aroma
on
the
pour
all
of
which
were
confirmed
in
the
still
glass
nice
milkdark
chocolate
balance
vanilla
cinnamon
and
a
hint
of
vegetal
spiciness
the
taste
isnt
as
nice
as
the
nose
but
still
contains
some
decent
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
the
cinnamon
its
all
corralled
by
the
pepper
spiciness
which
feels
higher
in
the
balance
than
it
should
be
everything
tastes
decent
together
but
i
wish
that
more
of
the
wonderful
sweet
spices
contained
in
the
nose
were
present
in
the
taste
body
is
light
and
slick
the
pepper
spiciness
again
keeps
any
of
the
sweetness
from
becoming
overbearing
imo
beers
like
this
should
lay
the
sweet
flavors
milk
chocolate
vanilla
cinnamon
on
thick
balance
them
with
dark
chocolateslight
hop
bitterness
and
then
use
the
spice
as
a
tool
to
keep
the
finish
dry
and
leave
the
imbiber
wanting
more
mole
stout
seems
a
bit
out
of
whack
compared
to
the
hunasabraxiss
of
the
world
which
really
isnt
fair
but
for
912
per
sixer
and
at
an
abv
that
makes
it
sessionable
within
its
style
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
me
cant
get
enough
of
the
mexican
hot
chocolate
stout
trend
o
overall
i
am
very
impressed
quite
unique
and
enjoyable
i
was
sad
to
have
missed
out
on
xocoveza
but
this
one
was
actually
recommended
to
me
by
a
stone
employee
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
usually
delicious
ska
stouts
actually
it
could
work
with
such
interesting
flavors
from
the
12
oz
can
purchased
at
bine
vine
in
san
diego
idunno
smells
thin
looks
just
dark
smell
is
thin
like
a
cheapbar
kind
of
smell
taste
is
the
same
cheapbar
kind
of
taste
with
some
chocolate
and
chile
saving
its
ass
not
enough
chile
for
me
though
i
bought
a
six
pack
hoping
this
stuff
is
gonna
be
decent
but
having
my
doubts
another
drink
meh
im
giving
this
stuff
away
serving
type
can
and
the
carbonation
good
is
saving
this
beer
from
being
terrible
great
stout
the
aroma
is
awesome
mexican
chocolate
cinnamon
nutmeg
dont
get
any
alcohol
in
the
nose
it
taste
even
better
overall
a
great
brew
actually
but
me
a
couple
6
packs
to
put
away
o
this
is
quite
nice
its
like
a
more
easygoing
xocoveza
thumbs
up
if
you
are
also
a
mole
lover
you
should
give
this
stout
a
try
if
youre
wary
of
red
chile
flavors
give
it
a
pass
a
very
rich
tasting
pleasingly
sensuous
textured
dark
beer
the
molé
peppers
are
balanced
just
about
right
subtle
yet
prominent
enough
to
add
depth
and
complexity
to
the
rich
sweetness
of
the
malt
grains
like
many
chili
pepper
beers
the
presence
of
a
head
is
problematic
as
far
as
visual
appeal
goes
and
the
aroma
is
rather
tame
but
these
minor
quibbles
shouldnt
stop
someone
who
wishes
give
their
taste
buds
a
treat
interesting
stout
easy
drinker
pretty
unique
especially
on
the
nose
id
drink
it
again
i
tried
this
as
the
great
american
beer
festival
and
was
captured
by
the
uniqueness
of
the
cumin
idea
enough
so
i
bought
a
sixer
after
the
fest
now
that
some
time
has
passed
what
appealed
to
me
about
it
then
just
doesnt
hold
up
its
worth
trying
if
youre
in
to
molé
or
chiles
and
especially
if
you
like
the
flavor
of
cumin
i
can
imagine
this
would
be
really
interesting
to
cook
with
as
well
i
cant
say
that
im
very
impressed
with
skas
mole
stout
i
like
the
idea
but
the
execution
is
lacking
the
spices
seem
stale
and
there
isnt
much
to
the
base
stout
i
cant
say
id
buy
this
one
again
nice
idea
using
the
cocoa
and
chile
but
other
breweries
have
done
this
before
to
greater
success
new
belgium
cocoa
mole
lost
abbey
mayan
judgement
day
etc
hops
bring
too
much
herbal
and
vegetative
flavors
while
the
spices
and
chilies
should
be
more
balanced
taxing
to
the
palate
after
a
while
o
glad
i
tried
it
but
chile
beer
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
too
spicy
for
my
taste
o
at
least
i
can
say
i
have
tried
it
not
gross
but
nothing
i
will
ever
want
again
not
one
to
bash
beers
so
i
will
just
leave
it
there
o
interesting
just
not
something
for
me
oi
admit
to
having
a
soft
spot
for
chile
beers
stouts
in
particular
and
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
little
harsh
and
disjointed
at
times
but
it
provides
a
good
dose
of
chile
aroma
and
flavor
and
decent
complexity
with
the
cinnamon
and
cocoa
the
mouthfeel
drags
the
score
down
a
bit
but
i
would
drink
this
again
on
a
cool
fall
day
like
today
without
complaining
just
as
the
flavor
is
affected
so
too
is
the
mouthfeel
as
this
beer
presents
a
challenge
to
the
palate
spiciness
mixed
with
an
odd
pungency
make
this
beer
less
smooth
going
down
then
one
would
like
in
the
end
its
an
okay
beer
but
still
one
that
cant
hang
with
other
better
spicy
stouts
molé
sic
stout
is
as
confusing
as
its
misspelled
name
it
isnt
a
bad
as
a
chilispice
beer
but
both
the
spelling
oddity
and
the
beers
offbalanced
flavors
make
me
wonder
if
the
brewers
understand
what
mole
is
supposed
to
taste
like
in
the
end
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
revisit
i
mean
this
boils
down
to
two
things
do
you
like
mole
do
you
like
drinking
mole
if
you
answered
no
to
either
this
probably
wont
be
for
you
it
is
however
a
very
well
crafted
beer
complex
and
layered
an
excellent
representation
of
what
its
trying
to
be
i
am
glad
i
picked
it
up
and
am
enjoying
the
experience
but
its
not
one
that
id
want
to
make
my
go
to
every
day
im
just
not
interested
in
drinking
mole
all
the
time
definitely
worth
checking
out
though
overall
as
a
fan
of
chili
beers
i
like
this
one
a
lot
recommended
the
beer
poured
an
opaque
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
sediment
and
little
to
no
head
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
cocoa
that
did
not
fully
encapsulate
the
flavors
to
come
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
less
cocoa
on
than
the
aroma
but
what
the
aroma
did
not
represent
was
the
spice
there
were
flavors
of
cinnamon
and
cardamom
with
a
slight
hint
of
clove
which
was
all
very
autumn
appropriate
while
i
didnt
detect
much
heat
from
the
chile
peppers
i
did
detect
a
bit
of
their
bittery
presence
the
flavor
did
leave
the
lingering
presence
of
mole
on
my
palate
which
is
an
obvious
target
definitely
an
interesting
brew
and
probably
with
more
heat
fresh
the
crack
posed
no
difficulty
nor
did
i
experience
gushing
or
any
other
form
of
problem
that
may
have
been
a
bad
batch
an
inverted
glug
began
a
nice
bit
of
pseudocascading
action
but
i
finally
had
to
back
off
to
avoid
overflow
i
had
a
brief
fizzy
finger
of
deeptan
head
with
low
retention
as
the
result
of
my
efforts
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
which
allowed
zero
light
penetration
the
melange
of
scents
emanating
on
the
nose
was
fabulous
chile
pepper
check
cocoa
chocolatiness
check
other
unidentifiable
spices
you
bet
no
lacing
but
an
oily
film
laid
atop
the
beer
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
i
was
worshipful
of
the
idea
that
they
did
not
go
overboard
on
the
scoville
units
just
as
ibus
measure
a
beers
hoppiness
sus
measures
a
peppers
heat
and
i
am
not
terribly
tolerant
of
heat
this
tasted
like
my
buddy
ernies
moms
mole
and
that
is
saying
something
she
was
a
great
cook
and
knew
how
much
i
appreciated
her
culinary
works
the
three
main
ingredients
really
worked
well
together
to
create
a
spicy
peppery
chocolaty
taste
that
i
find
hard
to
describe
otherwise
the
finish
held
a
heat
that
lingered
well
after
the
swallow
and
i
am
again
glad
that
they
did
not
go
overboard
this
could
be
a
scorching
beer
if
they
allowed
it
to
be
as
such
phew
this
is
what
i
would
describe
as
an
acquired
taste
pours
black
as
coal
with
a
very
quick
tanbrown
head
looks
like
burnt
motor
oil
aroma
is
dark
chocolate
covered
nuts
cinnamon
nutmeg
very
dark
roast
barley
and
bourbon
taste
follows
the
aroma
and
has
a
bittersweet
chocolate
tang
finish
not
getting
any
of
the
chile
the
boozy
bourbon
taste
leads
one
to
believe
this
is
more
than
a
5
5
abv
this
reminds
me
of
bourbon
filled
chocolates
had
this
with
a
chicken
mole
burrito
not
very
food
friendly
would
be
better
with
chocolate
senior
murphy
chile
cream
chocolates
to
be
exact
o
what
a
strange
interesting
beer
it
looks
like
still
cola
but
it
sure
tastes
different
i
like
elements
of
a
lot
of
this
beer
and
i
hate
elements
of
a
little
bit
of
this
beer
hmmm
ska
brewing
mole
stout
2
55
o
i
had
a
couple
of
these
the
other
night
and
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
now
that
im
able
to
sit
down
and
taste
it
objectively
and
sober
im
realizing
what
a
remarkable
find
this
is
the
most
amazing
part
of
it
is
the
pepper
because
of
how
subdued
and
mellow
it
is
blending
perfectly
with
the
chocolatey
toastyness
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
just
cant
get
over
it
other
pepper
beers
are
all
pepper
often
ruining
the
palate
for
anything
with
a
lighter
flavor
but
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
with
out
getting
tired
of
it
and
still
be
able
to
taste
my
food
good
job
ska
still
a
darn
fine
beer
just
needs
a
bit
of
fine
tuning
great
dessert
beer
i
would
actually
like
this
beer
without
the
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
whatever
stick
with
the
basics
in
a
chile
beer
chiles
chocolate
2
row
thanks
to
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
spicy
chili
peppers
taste
is
unique
spicy
yet
not
hot
per
say
a
bit
of
cocoa
a
different
flavor
that
while
good
is
not
something
i
would
want
a
steady
diet
of
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
unique
and
unusual
beer
worth
a
shot
otasty
brew
in
my
opinion
and
certainly
not
a
typical
stout
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
full
bodied
but
i
would
have
it
again
the
carbonation
is
medium
strong
the
small
bubbles
sharp
and
shortlived
the
liquid
is
light
and
a
little
dry
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
overall
i
would
certainly
recommend
trying
it
for
it
is
tasty
very
unique
style
tasty
you
can
ue
this
brew
to
impress
your
beer
snob
friends
as
something
they
may
never
have
had
check
it
out
next
chance
you
get
super
roasted
malts
mixing
well
with
chocolate
and
coffee
palate
is
slick
and
oily
this
is
a
chile
beer
where
you
can
taste
the
chilis
but
they
arent
overpowering
everything
seems
to
come
together
very
well
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
chili
beer
because
the
peppers
arent
that
prominent
and
dont
contribute
any
heat
to
the
taste
o
a
decent
drink
but
not
a
very
good
beer
i
really
cant
taste
anything
outside
of
the
chocolate
chiles
and
spices
honestly
wasnt
that
special
maybe
it
needs
somthing
to
set
it
apart
but
for
me
it
was
just
another
dark
beer
i
couldnt
find
any
chile
peppers
in
this
brew
at
all
o
probably
the
easiest
drinking
beer
i
have
tried
in
the
chile
beer
style
and
it
has
a
nice
complexity
of
flavors
to
it
not
something
i
would
want
to
have
multiple
in
a
session
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
d
bleh
the
feel
is
among
the
worst
ive
experienced
in
the
style
aroma
had
a
bit
of
hope
but
nothing
can
save
this
one
honest
drainpour
3c
average
this
is
a
hard
one
to
rate
for
me
i
believe
this
chile
beer
style
primarily
exists
to
provide
the
connoisier
with
a
new
experience
the
smell
and
taste
do
that
in
spades
its
extremely
difficult
to
get
many
of
the
fresh
flavors
this
beer
has
to
survive
the
brewing
process
and
arrive
on
your
palete
the
mouthfeel
and
especially
the
appearance
suffer
though
overall
i
recommend
it
but
i
feel
the
brewmasters
may
have
been
able
to
get
more
head
retention
somehow
maybe
we
could
see
this
in
a
nitro
can
or
nitro
tap
o
not
very
exciting
well
crafted
but
a
bit
too
modest
for
my
taste
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
this
was
a
nice
treat
and
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
low
abv
offering
this
packs
a
nice
flavor
that
i
bet
was
even
more
strong
when
it
was
first
released
in
early
autumn
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
have
everyday
or
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
despite
the
low
abv
but
a
fine
offering
and
quite
balanced
overall
for
a
spicechile
beer
overall
a
very
nice
mole
beer
very
similar
to
new
belgiums
version
but
maybe
a
step
below
o
this
isnt
bad
especially
for
a
style
that
often
isnt
my
favorite
that
said
i
wouldnt
seek
out
another
this
stout
was
something
that
i
have
never
had
before
it
was
like
a
chilly
spicy
stout
i
think
they
got
the
body
just
right
for
the
spices
no
so
much
for
the
stout
category
seems
more
like
a
brown
stout
at
most
i
enjoyed
it
for
its
creativity
but
think
it
would
be
hard
to
keep
going
back
to
i
think
it
is
worth
recommending
if
you
havent
tried
a
beer
like
this
it
is
worth
the
adventure
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
just
wish
it
was
a
tad
bit
more
carbonated
but
other
than
that
loved
it
overall
this
is
a
very
disorganized
beer
the
parts
are
good
however
the
sum
of
the
parts
are
off
d
it
sounds
good
smells
good
and
the
individual
notes
of
the
flavor
profile
are
nice
but
it
just
doesnt
come
come
together
it
is
kind
of
disjointed
and
the
base
beer
just
isnt
big
enough
to
deal
with
the
spices
i
would
love
to
try
an
imperial
version
of
this
beer
but
i
dont
really
like
it
as
it
is
a
very
good
chile
beer
wish
i
bought
more
than
a
sixer
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
its
not
a
sixer
id
want
to
session
all
night
but
one
or
two
really
hits
the
spot
this
beer
came
essentially
flat
and
tastes
like
someone
pored
a
little
stout
into
and
old
cola
it
is
somewhat
interesting
and
does
have
some
spice
and
heat
but
to
me
just
not
enough
stout
flavor
to
really
qualify
it
as
a
stout
i
usually
love
everything
from
ska
so
i
was
really
excited
when
i
saw
this
in
the
store
and
did
not
hesitate
to
buy
it
really
disappointing
taste
shows
some
really
nice
pepper
and
spice
blending
masterful
job
ska
the
pie
spices
are
just
enough
to
be
noticed
and
are
right
on
par
with
the
spicy
but
not
hot
peppers
the
stout
aspects
are
not
overlooked
with
a
chocolaty
twist
and
provide
some
much
needed
sweetness
to
keep
things
from
getting
too
spicepepper
leaning
despite
the
bold
flavors
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
i
am
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
chipotle
beers
but
i
find
this
one
to
be
a
very
well
done
smoky
chile
beer
o
overall
i
like
it
a
lot
id
love
to
try
it
on
draft
ill
keep
it
on
hand
for
a
change
of
pace
in
the
cool
weather
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
very
unique
i
think
i
enjoyed
the
lips
of
faith
cocoa
mole
better
this
one
seems
to
have
more
of
a
stout
character
than
the
lips
of
faith
that
being
said
this
one
is
still
worth
trying
my
first
venture
into
chili
beer
id
like
to
try
a
few
more
and
compare
to
this
one
this
is
certainly
a
unique
style
and
i
applaud
ska
for
brewing
it
i
snagged
this
beer
wanting
to
try
something
new
not
knowing
what
to
expect
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
couldnt
really
session
these
though
more
of
a
novelty
beer
o
this
is
my
first
chile
beer
and
i
must
say
that
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
kind
of
brew
i
was
surprised
on
just
how
complex
the
aroma
was
of
this
brew
and
even
in
the
taste
the
spices
really
dominate
the
body
along
with
a
huge
cocoa
backbone
and
i
feel
that
its
a
war
between
bold
spiciness
and
sweet
cocoa
thus
creating
a
slight
imbalance
to
be
honest
i
would
not
think
of
this
as
being
a
beer
because
of
the
immense
spices
o
despite
naming
your
brewery
after
a
musical
genre
that
everybody
prays
will
never
return
ska
brewing
shows
its
strength
in
this
beer
with
a
solid
ale
like
this
its
always
good
to
remember
to
never
underestimate
the
potential
of
a
colorado
microbrewery
one
of
the
coolest
style
of
beers
ive
seen
in
a
can
to
date
lets
see
how
it
holds
up
to
my
favorite
mexican
sauce
appearance
is
a
fizzy
opaque
brownish
black
head
is
non
existent
as
is
any
form
of
lacing
as
i
take
a
long
deep
smell
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
red
hots
candy
this
candy
cinnamon
quality
remains
at
the
forefront
and
basically
dominates
other
notes
theres
some
mild
dry
cocoa
in
the
background
the
taste
is
similar
candy
cinnamon
a
la
big
red
gum
or
red
hot
candy
plus
dry
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
roasty
malt
profile
the
finish
features
more
cinnamon
and
chocolate
with
the
chili
leaving
almost
zero
heat
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
prickly
with
a
medium
body
overall
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
not
amazing
like
i
was
hoping
new
belgiums
cocoa
mole
pulled
this
off
in
a
much
better
way
this
brew
feels
like
a
novelty
candy
beer
interesting
nonetheless
check
them
both
out
on
stitcher
and
itunes
almost
black
in
color
with
a
sliver
of
chestnut
across
the
bottom
capped
by
a
nice
creamy
looking
head
that
is
there
one
second
and
completely
gone
the
next
aromas
of
cinnamon
sweetness
and
semichocolaty
malt
modest
chili
smoke
and
fruity
esters
a
little
more
pepper
character
in
the
flavor
cocoa
sweetness
cola
spices
no
real
heat
at
all
increased
chocolate
flavor
as
it
warms
up
medium
bodied
and
very
lightly
carbonated
which
takes
some
of
the
life
out
of
it
if
they
get
the
carbonation
fixed
in
future
batches
this
will
definitely
be
better
this
was
incredibly
disappointing
it
tastes
like
cola
with
cinnamon
there
may
be
some
more
spice
to
this
than
just
cinnamon
but
it
gets
buried
under
the
intense
cola
flavor
ill
be
avoiding
this
at
all
costs
this
beer
had
me
going
at
first
like
omg
then
after
several
sips
i
quickly
lost
interest
because
it
gets
really
flat
very
light
mouth
feel
dont
get
me
wrong
i
do
like
it
but
only
because
i
still
cant
believe
the
flavor
and
is
really
a
beer
that
taste
good
but
with
almost
no
beer
qualities
as
far
as
looks
and
mouth
feel
goes
very
good
stout
to
start
a
for
those
who
are
new
to
the
darks
this
can
is
an
austin
powers
joke
waiting
to
happen
but
then
again
i
never
liked
those
movies
it
pours
a
deep
murky
blackbrown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
earthy
peppers
complete
with
mild
heat
roasted
malts
light
molasses
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
peppers
and
cinnamon
combining
for
a
unique
flavor
combination
all
whilst
the
roast
dances
fancily
behind
it
all
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
peppered
stout
one
that
could
probably
stand
to
be
yearround
good
times
liked
this
way
better
than
the
new
belgium
one
poured
blackish
brown
super
dark
with
almost
no
head
looks
almost
flat
but
there
is
some
depth
to
the
color
smell
is
bitter
bakers
chocolate
and
cocoa
powder
with
just
a
hint
of
pepper
the
flavor
is
that
dusty
cocoa
up
front
with
a
lot
of
smokey
malt
to
balance
it
out
i
feel
no
chili
heat
in
this
at
all
which
i
like
the
peppers
provide
just
a
subtle
bit
of
flavor
nothing
too
drastic
the
chocolate
in
the
finish
is
also
very
nice
a
little
sweeter
than
on
the
front
end
feel
isnt
as
good
as
it
could
be
it
needs
some
more
carbonation
to
pep
up
its
big
body
that
said
though
this
is
a
cool
new
beer
from
ska
i
would
like
to
make
a
pot
of
chili
with
it
at
some
point
those
flavors
would
be
outstanding
in
there
overall
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
pepper
id
pass
on
it
if
i
saw
it
again
overall
the
beers
taste
hits
its
goals
cinnamon
comes
through
as
well
as
some
sort
of
cayan
pepper
like
flavoring
it
is
not
offsetting
but
it
is
certainly
not
sessionable
edit
having
had
more
of
these
the
peppers
really
are
a
little
heavy
in
this
one
they
arent
adding
heat
but
theyre
compounding
the
roasted
notes
from
the
stout
its
really
tasty
at
first
but
after
about
12
can
once
it
warms
up
they
grind
on
the
palate
a
bit
i
havent
had
that
with
other
beers
like
this
overall
this
beer
is
in
my
unusual
but
good
category
i
will
buy
it
again
and
share
with
my
friends
my
only
complaint
is
the
lack
of
head
which
also
leaves
the
aroma
weak
give
it
a
head
that
lasts
and
this
beer
would
go
from
good
to
excellent
overall
i
love
this
its
not
spectacular
to
look
at
looks
like
a
coke
in
a
pint
glass
but
it
has
great
pepper
heat
chocolate
and
spices
as
advertised
great
beer
for
dia
de
los
muertos
ill
be
drinking
it
then
for
sure
pours
black
with
a
nice
dark
brown
head
head
retention
is
not
a
strength
for
this
one
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
cinnamon
underneath
there
is
a
touch
of
some
roastiness
chocolate
and
heat
from
the
peppers
flavor
again
started
strong
on
the
cinnamon
perhaps
a
touch
too
strong
but
then
in
the
rear
there
is
some
cocoa
something
offering
a
little
sweetness
some
roastiness
and
a
hit
of
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
isnt
hot
in
any
uncomfortable
way
but
there
is
definitely
heat
to
it
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
on
this
was
nice
medium
bodied
a
little
creamy
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
not
on
par
with
cocoa
mole
only
other
chile
stoutporter
i
have
tried
but
i
am
glad
to
have
been
able
grab
a
sixer
of
this
had
to
ding
the
appearance
because
while
this
beer
started
out
with
a
huge
head
it
was
almost
immediately
gone
dark
black
with
a
few
bubbles
at
the
surface
aroma
is
cinnamon
cocoa
peppers
pretty
good
flavor
follows
suit
but
is
really
not
robust
enough
and
feels
like
it
has
a
watery
aftertaste
both
cocoa
mole
from
new
belgium
and
mexican
chocolate
stout
from
copper
kettle
are
better
beers
probably
due
to
the
body
being
thicker
o
extremely
disappointed
a
lot
of
locals
wereare
really
looking
forward
to
this
and
personally
i
dont
think
it
has
lived
up
to
the
excitement
it
doesnt
scream
mole
or
stout
for
that
matter
too
me
just
tastes
like
someone
poured
a
mediocre
pumpkin
beer
into
a
very
mediocre
stout
comes
in
a
six
pack
of
12oz
cans
would
buy
again
poured
nearly
black
except
for
some
deep
brown
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
lighta
half
finger
tannish
colored
head
atop
cinnamon
and
chile
really
stand
out
in
the
nosea
hint
of
vanilla
and
earth
thrown
in
as
well
sweet
chocolate
and
spices
upfront
on
the
palatemaybe
a
bit
to
sweetcharred
chile
flavors
in
a
lingering
after
taste
its
a
bit
one
sided
with
the
cocoa
and
cinnamonlike
flavorsi
did
like
the
little
bit
of
char
and
spice
in
the
finish
though
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
tulip
glass
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
approaching
pitch
black
with
a
small
mocha
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smells
are
of
peppers
dark
roasted
malts
the
feel
is
medium
low
carbonation
the
taste
is
good
some
roasted
malts
a
peppery
finish
okay
hops
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
peppers
with
a
lot
of
the
roasted
ancho
notes
coming
through
strongly
i
also
get
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
some
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
very
nice
what
really
comes
through
early
is
some
cinnamon
and
chocolate
as
well
as
a
hint
of
heat
from
the
peppers
i
also
get
some
of
the
earthiness
from
the
chilies
as
well
as
some
nice
chili
flavor
the
chocolate
and
chili
notes
meld
very
well
together
with
just
the
right
amount
of
heat
and
sweetness
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
a
very
nice
stout
and
i
am
glad
more
and
more
breweries
are
brewing
beers
similar
to
this
one
i
would
say
this
is
really
an
interesting
brew
and
worth
trying
out
its
well
done
and
im
always
a
fan
of
breweries
doing
new
things
o
solid
different
beer
would
try
again
tri
pepper
pils
pours
a
golden
color
with
no
head
there
is
a
strong
hot
pepper
aroma
a
mixture
of
many
different
peppers
taste
has
a
mellow
but
noticeable
malty
backbone
with
lots
of
pepper
spices
full
flavors
especially
with
the
pepper
flavors
overall
a
very
nice
and
rich
pepper
infused
beer
if
you
hate
spicy
foods
youll
hate
this
beer
but
if
you
love
spicy
well
youll
be
in
heaven
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
downtown
brewpub
i
expected
to
enjoy
this
chile
beer
and
i
did
one
of
thei
best
lacey
thpugh
light
coloured
30
ibu
and
5
4
abv
but
the
story
is
the
hot
peppers
and
its
freshness
was
enjoyable
fuller
mouthfeel
i
drank
this
down
and
it
was
refreshing
and
spicy
az
d
i
refilled
my
glasses
a
few
times
but
i
think
i
liked
this
one
far
more
than
most
i
suspect
a
third
of
the
growler
will
be
used
for
cooking
but
i
imagine
the
results
will
be
quite
delicious
if
you
like
peppers
and
chili
beer
this
is
a
musttry
sampled
on
draught
at
the
downtown
madison
wisconsin
brewpub
pours
a
clear
golden
copper
brew
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
that
has
some
excellent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
green
and
red
bell
peppers
a
touch
of
golden
grain
malt
and
more
herbal
spices
taste
is
medium
bodied
light
carbonated
with
distinct
green
bell
peppers
golden
grain
malt
and
black
pepper
finish
starts
mildly
spicy
and
then
a
lingering
spice
burn
that
slowly
goes
away
woo
this
beer
doesnt
cut
it
for
me
this
beer
is
perfect
for
someone
looking
for
an
interesting
challenge
for
hisher
taste
buds
cloudy
light
color
the
smell
attacks
your
nose
with
a
strong
pepper
aroma
in
a
good
way
and
the
taste
of
pepper
is
as
strong
it
burns
your
mouth
a
little
tingles
down
your
throat
as
you
drink
it
and
warms
your
insides
the
pepper
taste
is
not
overwhelming
though
there
is
still
a
nice
pilsner
taste
it
is
definitely
for
sipping
but
is
very
drinkable
despite
the
pepper
it
is
by
far
the
beer
i
miss
the
most
since
moving
away
from
madison
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
it
actually
starts
to
look
a
little
darker
in
the
middle
very
clear
with
kind
of
a
thin
head
it
leaves
a
little
lacing
but
not
a
whole
lot
the
smell
of
dried
peppers
rises
up
to
my
nose
like
red
pepper
flakes
thats
the
first
bit
that
i
smell
then
you
get
the
flesh
like
a
fresh
cut
bell
or
jalapeno
i
can
also
smell
a
bit
of
earthy
kind
of
herbal
hops
theres
a
hint
of
powdery
malts
but
still
smells
very
dry
the
peppers
smell
a
bit
scary
im
afraid
of
the
burn
a
little
but
this
has
to
be
the
best
chile
beer
ive
ever
smelled
the
taste
starts
and
finishes
with
pepper
pepper
pepper
its
not
all
spice
though
to
be
honest
theres
a
good
taste
of
the
peppers
flesh
which
i
really
love
theres
a
nice
crispness
to
the
heat
it
sort
of
comes
up
suggests
to
you
that
its
there
then
fades
a
bit
in
the
finish
the
malt
flavor
is
a
bit
powdery
like
freshly
crushed
pale
and
pilsenser
malts
but
ill
be
goddamned
if
the
peppers
dont
get
there
first
the
spice
is
really
incredible
not
bad
incredible
but
the
kind
of
spice
i
love
this
one
again
stand
up
higher
than
most
of
the
competition
while
still
not
being
the
most
enjoyable
style
the
head
really
adds
to
the
feel
of
this
beer
whether
in
your
mouth
or
your
stomach
makes
it
feel
a
bit
full
though
i
imagine
that
the
beer
itself
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
either
way
it
kind
of
feels
like
a
pilsenser
but
with
a
bit
of
fire
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
i
actually
really
enjoy
it
though
worth
a
show
if
you
go
to
the
brewpub
and
are
looking
to
cross
a
style
off
the
list
or
if
youre
a
fan
of
a
bit
of
spice
a
good
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
strong
pepper
fits
the
style
of
a
chile
beer
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
wow
what
a
spicy
burn
tastes
of
great
fresh
peppers
used
to
other
chile
beers
with
nothing
close
to
this
flavor
of
freshness
and
some
very
slight
yeast
cleanliness
overall
easily
the
best
chile
beer
ive
ever
had
came
a
very
thick
malty
beer
with
a
clear
body
low
carbonation
pretty
damn
good
tasting
it
starts
like
a
solid
czech
pils
though
much
fuller
in
flavor
and
complicated
good
maltiness
and
deliciousness
all
around
then
the
light
peppery
character
kicks
in
very
lightly
spicy
lingering
spiciness
gives
a
solid
drinkability
and
very
flavorful
all
around
a
pretty
decent
pils
if
heavy
in
its
own
right
and
a
great
chile
beer
overall
very
unique
and
kudos
to
the
brewing
staff
for
brewing
outside
the
box
i
had
a
4oz
sample
and
that
is
pretty
much
all
i
would
want
update
2007
version
when
fresh
is
insanely
spicy
it
is
also
clear
this
year
made
from
poblano
habanero
and
one
other
pepper
cayenne
i
think
really
this
beer
is
hot
it
causes
bumps
to
form
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
thanks
for
my
finest
chile
beer
experience
yet
cokes
back
to
the
beer
at
hand
i
honestly
doubt
a
pepper
beer
can
be
done
any
better
and
because
of
that
this
might
stand
as
great
danes
greatest
acheivement
light
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
solid
carbonation
take
the
pepper
out
of
the
picture
and
youve
got
a
solid
pils
keep
it
in
and
youve
got
one
of
the
best
tasting
chilepepper
beers
out
there
not
as
soft
spoken
as
many
seem
to
be
you
know
what
youre
drinking
when
you
lay
into
this
and
the
flavor
is
delightful
suitable
for
aced
drinking
not
for
the
hot
sun
oi
have
good
memories
of
drinking
pattys
beer
in
college
but
the
memories
are
better
than
the
beer
anyway
this
is
an
easy
drinking
ale
with
a
healthy
hit
of
chili
flavor
and
not
much
more
if
you
are
looking
for
complexity
or
intensity
look
elsewhere
you
really
have
to
be
prepared
for
this
one
its
pretty
spicy
and
as
such
it
goes
great
with
mexican
food
but
its
really
a
sipper
and
its
tough
for
me
to
put
down
a
whole
pint
just
because
of
the
strong
pepper
flavor
people
either
love
this
beer
or
hate
it
as
a
result
since
im
not
a
big
hot
and
spicy
guy
id
pass
on
ordering
it
straight
up
but
its
actually
great
in
a
sampler
overall
a
solid
mild
chile
beer
good
flavor
but
not
a
lot
of
heat
c
one
of
the
few
chili
beers
i
really
actually
like
to
drink
a
pint
of
from
time
to
time
pours
a
pale
ale
looking
straw
color
with
an
average
white
head
smells
like
a
ton
of
roasted
chilies
like
the
farmers
market
in
late
summer
smokey
and
spicey
flavor
has
no
heat
at
all
though
just
the
essence
of
anaheim
and
serrano
peppers
there
is
a
good
light
malty
body
to
support
all
the
pepper
flavor
and
a
complimentary
late
hop
burst
that
kind
of
cools
the
thing
off
a
bit
goes
great
with
the
calamari
at
wynkoop
and
will
definitely
surprise
you
if
you
think
chili
beers
arent
your
thing
this
one
is
famous
for
a
reason

overall
interesting
how
many
of
their
beers
look
alike
this
one
is
a
little
over
powering
with
the
chili
not
too
many
other
flavors
outside
of
chili
pepper
poured
a
clear
brassy
color
with
a
small
white
head
smell
was
not
too
strong
but
had
faint
aromas
of
grains
and
chili
peppers
taste
this
beer
tasted
like
tacos
i
expected
a
little
bit
of
a
spicy
twinge
like
with
most
other
chili
beers
ive
had
but
this
wasnt
really
spicy
at
all
just
tasted
like
tacos
really
amazing
actually
an
easy
pale
malt
base
but
when
settled
on
the
palate
i
could
taste
the
corn
of
the
tortillas
vegetables
and
chili
peppers
sans
the
burn
i
dont
mind
the
burn
but
this
was
definitely
a
nice
change
of
pace
lightmedium
body
and
very
smooth
this
was
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
went
great
with
the
food
pretty
good
beer
for
how
different
it
is
drinkability
is
good
very
unusual
if
you
like
the
taste
of
green
chilis
youll
like
it
but
dont
come
for
strong
smoke
or
heat
very
unique
for
the
style
drinkability
a
very
good
pepper
beer
that
is
probably
in
my
top
five
for
the
style
the
bite
is
good
and
is
not
overpowering
the
beer
taste
is
there
i
have
sessioned
this
before
at
the
bar
this
my
first
beer
from
the
wynkoop
brewery
had
a
very
nice
chili
taste
to
it
to
me
it
was
like
have
the
best
nachos
and
cheese
with
all
the
fixins
you
love
in
a
bottle
also
wood
make
a
great
contribution
to
nachos
and
cheese
not
to
spicy
has
ive
had
from
other
chile
beers
but
very
balanced
taste
interestingly
enough
this
may
have
been
my
favorite
sampling
at
the
brewery
during
my
gabf
08
visit
the
beer
begins
with
a
fairly
average
blonde
ale
base
that
shows
soft
pilsner
maltiness
sweetness
and
a
mild
ester
profile
the
peppers
are
the
mild
aneheim
ones
that
deliver
a
crisp
vegitablechile
taste
that
blends
well
with
the
grains
the
heat
is
mild
giving
balance
to
the
malts
in
the
absence
of
noticible
hops
light
in
the
body
which
makes
the
beer
very
drinkable
finishes
with
a
chili
taste
and
moderate
warming
quite
nice
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
great
head
and
some
nice
lacing
as
well
as
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
nearly
lager
like
in
its
appearance
nice
sweet
beer
good
balance
between
malt
and
hop
with
a
great
chile
flavor
enough
to
enjoy
but
not
so
much
it
takes
away
from
everything
else
it
goes
down
nice
if
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
i
had
this
one
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
on
my
birthday
at
wynkoop
while
im
not
adverse
to
trying
something
new
this
one
threw
me
off
the
chile
flavor
is
a
bit
too
overpowering
for
me
and
it
doesnt
balance
well
with
the
beer
i
can
appreciate
how
some
would
like
it
and
i
honestly
didnt
find
it
vile
however
i
would
not
order
this
one
ever
again
it
was
just
too
overpowering
in
a
bad
way
to
me
flavor
dominated
by
the
anaheim
chile
taste
a
bit
sweet
in
the
middle
finish
hot
a
nice
chile
burn
to
it
great
with
a
burger
i
thought
one
is
enough
for
me
though
this
beer
is
not
bad
and
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
i
love
chili
beers
there
is
not
a
lot
going
on
here
but
it
is
pretty
drinkable
ordered
on
tap
at
the
wynkoop
brewery
in
denver
usually
im
not
a
fan
of
chili
beers
although
this
one
worked
for
me
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
greenish
tint
slightly
cloudy
very
small
bubbles
of
carbonation
white
head
as
expected
the
smell
and
taste
of
green
chilis
dominated
hard
to
taste
the
malt
or
hops
in
it
the
chilis
lingered
a
bit
although
they
werent
overly
hot
they
didnt
affect
the
mouthfeel
at
all
although
the
strong
chili
flavor
made
for
tough
drinkability
their
take
on
the
style
seemed
good
although
i
personally
dont
reach
for
chili
beers
if
you
live
in
the
area
or
stop
into
the
wynkoop
while
in
denver
this
beer
is
a
musttry
just
for
its
uniqueness
this
chile
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
somewhat
the
smell
was
a
sharp
green
chilelike
aroma
backed
by
some
maltiness
the
taste
was
dominated
by
green
chiles
though
not
overly
hotspicy
but
more
of
a
woody
or
earthy
flavor
there
was
a
good
bready
maltiness
in
the
background
and
a
very
mild
sweetness
and
very
modest
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
peppery
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
malt
and
chile
flavor
lingered
this
was
a
good
example
of
this
style
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
more
than
one
in
a
row
aside
from
the
lack
of
chilipower
the
beer
had
little
other
flavor
it
did
have
a
noticeable
maltnuttiness
but
hops
were
mild
and
it
was
a
really
light
beer
dont
bother
daring
anyone
to
try
this
unless
theyre
intimidated
by
extra
mild
salsa
i
enjoy
the
peppersspice
in
this
beer
but
it
is
overpowering
enough
to
completely
crush
any
other
flavors
the
multiple
types
of
peppers
give
it
a
little
complexity
which
is
definitely
appreciated
its
hot
but
not
to
the
point
of
undrinkabilitiy
overall
its
a
decent
chili
beer
but
it
falls
just
a
little
short
its
worth
a
shot
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
or
have
adventurous
tastes
but
a
lot
of
beer
drinkers
would
probably
be
turned
off
had
my
favorite
chili
mixed
with
my
favorite
drink
heck
yes
best
combo
ever
had
this
while
camping
in
yosemite
for
my
honeymoon
bottle
to
camp
mug
pours
a
light
gold
smells
like
fresh
sliced
peppers
the
thin
head
dissipates
into
nice
lace
around
the
top
flavor
is
straight
up
chilies
but
not
overly
spicy
in
fact
its
just
perfect
for
my
taste
i
have
had
many
pepper
beers
seeing
as
how
i
live
so
close
to
bp
in
san
diego
i
have
had
a
habanero
sculpin
that
had
almost
no
pepper
taste
and
was
disappointing
and
had
a
habanero
piper
down
that
i
couldnt
get
down
but
this
beer
has
a
small
amount
of
heat
and
full
pepper
flavor
if
you
like
peppers
and
spice
grab
this
beer
if
you
cant
handle
even
a
little
heat
be
warned
o
if
you
like
heat
in
your
beverage
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
not
as
drinkable
or
as
complex
as
other
chili
beers
ive
had
but
a
good
example
of
a
spicy
lager
overall
this
beer
was
a
bit
more
spicy
than
other
beers
i
have
had
of
the
same
style
i
didnt
like
it
some
spice
is
good
but
this
one
was
overpowering
in
my
opinion
i
will
not
drink
it
again
spiced
with
fresno
chiles
holy
cow
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
out
of
this
world
smalls
like
habanero
chilejalapeno
right
away
the
most
chile
ive
ever
gotten
out
of
the
aroma
in
a
beer
some
light
grain
and
light
malt
aroma
but
straight
up
chile
pepper
taste
is
the
same
i
have
thought
that
i
have
become
a
custom
to
chile
beers
considering
the
recent
fad
in
the
craft
scene
but
this
takes
it
to
a
whole
other
level
very
spicy
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
definitely
the
spiciest
beer
ive
ever
had
when
it
comes
to
heat
a
ton
of
heat
from
the
fresno
chile
peppers
i
could
only
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
if
they
made
a
michelada
outta
this
mouthfeel
is
light
but
it
burns
as
it
goes
down
the
throat
because
of
the
chile
heat
drinkability
is
somewhat
high
once
you
get
used
to
the
heat
overall
the
best
bee
that
tiogasequoia
has
ever
put
out
only
because
it
pushes
the
limits
i
havent
ever
been
too
impressed
with
my
local
brewery
but
this
one
knocked
my
socks
off
