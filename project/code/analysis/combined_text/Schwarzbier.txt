over
a
touch
of

as
it
warms
the
smokiness
becomes
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
still
subtle
light
body
with
a
slightly
smooth
texture
which
is
spot
on
since
this
is
a
lager
above
average
carbonation
with
a
nice
effervescence
throughout
the
flavor
profile
is
simply
outstanding
complex
balanced
and
intense
it
begins
with
a
slightly
sweet
roast
character
that
flows
into
a
roast
bitterness
with
chocolate
underneath
in
the
middle
a
light
sweet
bitter
chocolate
predominates
in
an
effervescent
rush
in
the
somewhat
dry
finish
smoked
malts
take
command
and
leave
you
with
a
campfire

smokiness
that
lingers
o
while
not
exactly

drinkability
this
beer
goes
very
well
with
beef
which
was
a
beef
and
noodle
casserole
for
dinner
even
by
itself
this
beer
is
quite
good
and
can
be
a
bit
of
a
dessert
as
well
as
for
drinkability
though
i
find
one
is
enough
per
evening
i
am
not
sure
i
could
have
another
as
im
sated
after
this
one
beer
pours
a
perfect
pitch

no
light
escapes
no
edges
and
no
hues
one
finger
of
mocha
colored
foam
that
falls
well
and
leaves
some
wet
lace
to
slide
down
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
char
and
smoke
there
is
a
faint
whiff
of
the
meaty
scent
like
you
get
in
all
smoked
beers
but
it
is
perfectly
under
control
and
very
faint
this
has
a
creamy
soft
body
with
plenty
of
malt
that
has
been
blackened
brought
to
its
driest
to
its
richest
without
bitterness
its
crisp
malt
the
chocolate
is
light
on
the
palate
but
just
keeps
up
its
appearance
the
smoke
is
a
bit
of
char
and
a
faint
bit
of
cherry
wood
lovely
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
drinks
a
bit
thin
and
could
use
a
couple
more
bubbles
from
carbonation
finishes
just
dry
and
with
only
a
slight
bitter
which
is
lovely
next
to
that
light
smoke
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
subtleness
of
the
roasted
and
smoked
malts
would
probably
make
this
a
good
introductory
beer
for
someone
new
to
the
style
earthy
bitterness
mild
smokiness
bitter
oats
bittersweet
chocolate
and
all
with
some
late
lagery
crispness
impressive
layers
of
flavor
very
easy
to
enjoy
although
i
wish
there
was
more
carbonation
the
sour
character
lightness
of
body
and
high
carbonation
lead
me
to
believe
that
this
beer
may
be
infected
i
like
the
subtlety
of
the
smoke
character
and
the
malt
is
wonderful
so
im
ignoring
the
flaw

i

i
am
glad
to
see

enjoy

this
is
a
conundrum
as
the
offering
itself
is
a
very
good
schwarzbier
but
there
is
no
hint
of
the
advertised
smoke

a
very

here
is

inthe

the
mild

aftertaste
lingers
for
a
long
time
a
very
tasty
dark
lager
that
gets
my
highest
respect
d
pretty
good
version
of
a
kinda
higher
octane
schwarzbier
not
smoky
enough
to
go
all
rauchbier
on
em
but
enough
to
impart
some
character
enjoyed
from
a
22
oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
fine
black
lager
pours
a
thick
black
with
a
fantastic
brown
head
of
dissipating
foam
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
ring
and
light
lacing
nose
of
chocolate
light
smoke
sweet
malts
and
black
raisins
flavors
are
strong
sweet
up
front
a
raisin
note
come
through
on
the
rear
blending
in
nicely
with
the
chocolate
notes
this
is
a
seriously
slick
brew
with
light
carbonation
for
a
lager
with
a
smooth
mouth
feel
that
finishes
lightly
bitter
from
the
malts
and
lightly
bitter
hops
nice
i
was
highly
disappointed
by
this
beer
i
didnt
really
have
a
lot
of
expectations
but
i
didnt
expect
this
i
had
the
guinness
black
lager
recently
and
loved
that
so
i
thought
hey
a
black
lager
this
should
be
good
but
this
was
way
worse
again
a
lot
of
this
is
just
personal
preference
but
i
just
dont
like
the
flavor
profile
andor
balance
of
this
beer
its
far
from
terrible
but
i
think
the
smokiness
is
just
really
out
of
place
in
a
lager
overall
rich
flavorful
and
cleanloads
of
roasted
malt
and
hops
the
fairly
full
texture
helps
to
smooth
out
the
otherwise
sharp
bite
of
the
roasted
malt
and
hop
acidity
though
the
roastiness
is
still
a
bit
much
the
aroma
is
wonderfully
appetizing
very
tasty
and
bold
on
the
whole
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
near
black
with
a
browntan
foamy
one
inch
head
not
much
lacing
along
the
glass
as
you
finish
smell
dark
chocolate
roasted
barley
malt
caramel
taste
is
very
bitter
this
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
solid
crisp
chocolate
bite
heavy
on
the
malt
with
all
organic
ingredients
this
is
a
very
complex
interesting
beer
there
was
a
slight
sourness
in
the
finish
but
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
for
a
great
thanksgiving
or
christmas
meal
o
obviously
this
is
not
an
orthodox
schwarzbier
but
it
is
a
pretty
much
exceptional
new
world
take
on
the
style
this
lager
is
proof
that
rogue
still
pumps
out
worthwhile
beers
with
regularity

dark

a

and
some

palate
includes
all
these
elements
plus
some
dry
chocolate
flakes
and
light
ash
for
good
measure
starts
sweet
and
roasty
almost
stoutlike
before
going
very
crisp
and
dry
for
the
finish
as
per
the
style
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
stoutlike
vibe
as
does
the
low
key
carbonation
some
nobletype
hops
add
a
little
pepper
and
vanilla
perhaps
great
stuff
and
manages
to
deliver
more
robust
flavors
than
maybe
one
would
expect
from
a
lager
of
this
ilk
is
is
too
sweet
perhaps
heres
where
i
channel
my
micheal
jacksonlike
disregard
for
uberrigid
style
guidelines
in
favor
of
just
enjoying
the
show
stout
like
but
different
mouthfeel
now
ill
start
off
by
saying
im
not
the
biggest
rogue
fan
around
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
drank
of
theirs
in
a
few
years
with
that
said
dirtoir
black
lager
is
one
of
the
best
schwarzbiers
i
have
ever
had
its
up
there
with
the
likes
of
monschof
black
bavarian
and
duck
rabbit
it
drinks
more
like
duck
rabbits
than
the
previous
two
with
the
weight
and
boldness
a
great
beer
toss
this
into
six
packs
and
ill
be
a
happy
camper
what
a
beer
well
done
rogue
you
still
got
it
this
beer
was
well
made
and
great
for
those
enjoying
the
doppelbock
or
even
stout
styles
the
color
was
intense
motor
oil
with
a
deep
brown
rim
the
aromas
were
malty
bitter
cocoa
powder
pumpernickel
and
dark
spices
the
flavors
were
similar
to
the
nose
with
accentuated
rye
breadpumpernickel
and
bitter
chocolate
tones
with
a
touch
more
astringency
on
the
finish
than
i
anticipated
this
was
truly
bread
in
a
glass
and
is
great
for
someone
looking
for
a
well
made
malty
and
thick
doppelbock
style
beer
without
the
intense
price
tag
chatoe
rogue
first
growth
dirtoir
black
lager
is
a
must
try
if
you
can
find
it
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
of
the
smell
but
it
was
a
little
muted
cocoa
hides
behind
dark
malt
the
taste
in
the
mouth
has
no
such
shortcoming
with
strong
and
well
balanced
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
and
i
could
use
another
a
bit
too
black
confusing
but
nice
and
drinkable
in
the
end
interesting
that
roasted
malts
won
the
battle
against
hops
well
otherwise
it
would
be
an
imperial
stout
this
is
much
heavier
than
a
schwarzbier
still
pleasant
to
drink
nice
that
they
could
get
all
that
flavor
out
of
a
lager
recommendable
kickass
schwarzbier
best
ive
had
overall
this
was
one
tasty
brew
it
had
the
right
level
of
bitter
hop
and
sweetness
to
complement
the
darker
and
roastier
chocolate
and
coffeeespresso
flavors
of
the
brew
well
done
dark
and
rich
what
you
would
expect
from
rogue
a
tad
bit
more
a
little
over
the
top
very
pleasent
beer
great
hop
flavor
you
just
feel
the
freshness
comeing
out
of
this
one
all
of
the
brews
in
this
series
are
wonderfull
hope
john
comes
up
with
more
cold
22oz

jet
black
with
a
healthy
dark
brown
head
in

this
is
seriously
dark
stuff
surprising
rich
malty
aroma
even
for
a
schwarzbier
flavor
is
fairly
hoppy
hops
seems
a
little
muddled
im
not
really
familar
with
independent
and
revelolution
flavor
through
the
middle
is
roasty
with
more
of
a
burnt
aftertaste
carbonation
is
relatively
light
barely
cutting
through
the
compartively
heavy
grain
bill
seriously
i
feel
like
i
can
taste
little
particles
of
nearly
ashen
roasted
barley
on
my
tongue
of
course
the
beer
is
too
opaque
to
see
if
theres
actual
grain
or
any
other
sediment
suspended
in
it
compared
to
this
other
schwarzbiers
are

with

this
is
an

expression
of
the

with

and
an
etched

surface
accented
by
slightly
mocha
foam
some

bubbles
around

light
bodied
with

and
an
appropriately
dry

nice
beer
i
hate
rogue
but
this
is
a
good
schwarzbier
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
it
took
me
totally
by
surprise
how
much
i
got
off
on
this
stuff
it
pours
jet
black
dense
looking
for
a
lager
with
a
tall
and
lasting
coffee
colored
head
of
tiny
bubbles
the
nose
is
really
dark
roasted
barley
nearly
burnt
with
notes
of
coffee
and
raw
black
chocolate
its
earthy
and
organic
smelling
dank
in
a
way
and
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
but
not
quite
in
the
cascadian
dark
ale
range
yet
at
least
as
far
as
the
nose
goes
the
flavor
is
amazing
it
starts
off
really
bitter
like
espresso
but
not
acidic
its
got
a
touch
of
smoke
to
it
black
soil
and
then
comes
the
hops
slightly
citric
but
more
bitter
than
anything
adding
a
nice
compliment
to
the
already
dry
bitter
malt
profile
the
beer
then
smoothly
but
swiftly
transitions
in
a
crisp
black
lager
lighter
than
its
been
until
now
suddenly
being
at
one
refreshing
and
warming
the
heavy
cloud
has
lifted
and
the
beer
finishes
like
any
lager
should
what
a
journey
mouthfeel
follows
suit
starting
heavy
as
hell
like
a
massive
stout
but
it
then
relaxes
to
a
lager
feel
crisp
and
clean
there
is
so
much
flavor
brilliantly
packed
into
this
beer
which
starts
sturdy
and
ends
delicately
this
may
be
the
best
rogue
beer
ive
ever
had
and
it
has
inspired
me
to
buy
some
of
the
other
grow
your
own
series
beers
from
them
as
this
is
simply
exquisite
the
first
beer
to
blow
my
mind
in
a
long
time
it
went
expertly
with
spicy
blackbeans
and
escargots
over
angel
hair
what
a
gem
this
is
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
but
there
are
other
similar
beers
that
i
would
choose
first
black
lager
pours
a
black
color
with
a
very
small
tan
head
there
is
a
nice
strong
malty
and
coffee
aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
coffee
bite
very
full
bodied
good
malty
backbone
good
full
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
want
more
overall
a
fantastic
example
of
this
style
a
must
try
taste
roastiness
right
off
the
bat
followed
by
the
mocha
and
chocolate
right
behind
it
little
mixes
of
oatmeal
and
coffee
grains
very
smooth
mouthfeel
but
not
really
heavy
at
all
super
easy
drinker
being
a
big
fan
of
stouts
i
like
having
something
easy
to
drink
like
this
in
between
to
have
great
job
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
enjoy
it
as
a
session
beer
o
great
roast
character
with
excellent
drinkability
overall
i
like
it
its
heavy
and
i
was
expecting
a
much
lighter
brew
it
says
lager
for
dogs
sake
but
there
really
hasnt
been
a
lot
of
beers
i
dont
like
so
maybe
beer
tasting
really
isnt
my
thing
but
i
wont
drink
bud
so
i
do
have
some
class
rogues
ditroir
black
lager
disappointed
me
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
fails
to
compare
with
others
in
both
the
schwarzbier
style
and
beers
with
similarly
dark
roasted
flavors
in
rogues
line
give
dirtoir
black
lager
a
try
then
treat
yourself
to
a
bottle
of
rogues
chocolate
stout
youll
see
what
i
mean
and
i
doubt
youll
pick
up
another
bottle
of
the
former
i
know
i
wont
slight
astringency
on
the
back
end
with
lingering
roasted
malt
and
smoke
flavor
o
great
beer
rogue
has
never
disappointed
me
not
once
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
out
and
i
know
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
other
two
beers
in
their
chateau
series
worth
the
buy
hands
down
the
mouth
is
creamy
smooth
and
heavier
than
id
like
this
is
really
odd
for
a
schwarzbier
not
as
easydrinking
as
expected
really
big
flavors
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
these
flavors
are
usually
nice
and
mellow
with
this
style
but
this
is
just
way
too
big

glad
i
tried
this
but
this

id
reach

in

is
far
from
anything
that
in
the

seems
the
brewer
went
all

on
this

made

this

that

i

great

rogue
in
my

i
wrote
blacklight

but
i
think
this
refers
to
something
on
the
tap
handle
perhaps
although
it
did
pour
a
solid
roasty
black
with
some
light
showing
through
so
maybe
thats
what
i
meant
anyways
theres
a
great
roasty
malt
aroma
on
this
with
some
chocolate
notes
flavor
is
all
about
the
dark
chocolate
and
roast
theres
a

it

o
not

its
an

i
love

this

this
is
a

that
id
certainly
come
back
to
again

this

is

a

for

rogue
did
a

other

could

than

very

and
it

flavor
for
the
gravity
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
schwarzbier
with
a
very
robust
flavor
profile
and
easy
smooth
drinking
definitely
surprised
me
with
the
smokey
profile
at
first
though
o
a
very
tasty
dark
beer
that
i
wouldnt

having
a

smoke
a
small
alcohol
presence
is
noted
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
overall
a
half
decent
schwarz
but
next
year
would
probably
be
better
overall
a
very
drinkable
dark
beer
the
lager
yeast
really
smooths
and
balances
things
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
the
leaves
good
lacing
the
taste
is
somewhat
fruity
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
overtones
with
additional
spiciness
the
sweetness
is
due
to
heavy
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
it
looks
like
a
stout
but
tastes
more
like
a
heavy
porter
there
could
be
some
oak
flavor
in
the
background
a
very
tasty
schwarzbier
with
emphasis
on
the
smoked
and
roasted
malt
flavors
the
bitterness
tanginess
and
other
components
blend
well
with
the
sweetness
the
only
thing
id
like
to
change
would
be
the
bodys
low
weight
and
its
carbonation
regardless
one
that
i
keep
returning
to
when
i
see
it
overall
a
decent
beer
but
a
bit
more
roast
flavor
than
ive
had
in
other
beers
of
this
style
the
tang
overwhelms
the
flavor
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
a
bit
chocolatey
for
a
traditional
schwarzbier
but
im
not
complaining
quite
tasty
and
very
interesting
with
the
smoky
and
earthy
notes
not
something
id
go
for
all
the
time
but
i
would
definitely
buy
it
againi
liked
this
one
a
lot
overall
solid
american
schwarzbier
leans
toward
the
chocolate
malt
spectrum
which
i
prefer
surprisingly
good
for
how
old
this
bottle
probably
is
o
this
is
a
damn
fine
schwarzbier
if
i
do
say
so
myself
enough
characteristics
to
show
that
its
a
dark
lager
and
not
a
stout
or
porter
yet
enough
taste
and
flavor
to
make
it
great
id
recommend
this
one
for
sure
note
until
i
read
the
ba
reviews
for
this
beer
i
was
pretty
sure
that
the
bar
mixed
up
the
taps
and
this
was
the
rogue
chocolate
stout
im
glad
it
was
not
but
boy
are
those
2
beers
similar
luckily
both
are
quite
tasty
even
though
they
are
completely
different
styles
a
very
good
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
stumble
upon
overall
not
too
bad
more
of
a
stout
than
a
lager
not
getting
the
lager
yeast
oone
and
done
on
this
onejust
was
not
impressed
was
very
thin
tastes
like
a
watery
stout
smells
like
chocolatey
porter
o
one
of
the
better
american
versions
of
a
schwarzbier
even
though
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
one
rich
roasted
malts
and
a
smoky
sort
of
peat
like
smell
coming
through
off
of
this
one
right
way
very
rich
with
a
touch
of
bitternesshidden
way
in
the
back
i
had
a
feeling
this
was
going
to
be
good
now
very
nice
earthy
and
grassy
touches
throughout
as
well
with
a
touch
of
molasses
maybe
as
it
warms
up
rich
chocolate
like
flavor
almost
coming
through
in
the
beginning
and
then
turning
over
to
a
more
roasted
and
smoke
like
flavor
lots
of
different
earthy
tones
here
were
coming
together
rather
nicely
a
touch
of
caramel
or
molasses
like
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
some
of
the
bittering
effects
in
it
towards
the
end
the
finish
was
quick
and
clean
with
a
nice
smoke
flavor
in
the
finish
albeit
lighter
then
what
you
would
typically
think
of
a
smoked
flavor
being
overall
a
slow
drinker
but
very
hearty
several
people
around
me
agreed
that
this
one
would
go
great
with
a
steak
o
an
interesting
brew
especially
considering
the
grow
your
own
theme
id
definitely
have
it
again
although
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
in
one
sitting
o
the
beer
is
packed
with
interesting
flavors
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
it
isnt
very
filling
or
high
in
alcohol
content
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sessionable
dark
lager
o
good
beer
overall
and
one
id
go
to
again
kudos
to
rogue
for
gyo
o
somewhat
disappointing
although
i
do
commend
them
for
the
gyo
dedication
on
this
brew
this
bottle
could
have
been
a
little
old
as
well
adding
to
the
lack
of
hops
in
the
flavor
o
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
i
felt
it
could
have
used
a
unique
character
to
identify
itself
with
the
body
and
flavor
as
strong
as
it
was
im
surprised
its
only
6
abv
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
its
just
to
average
of
a
beer
to
crave
o
i
like
this
beer
creamy
body
with
nice
roasted
malts
pretty
good
alround
o
recommended
for
fans
of
schwarzbier
who
also
like
an
imperial
stout
this
schwarzbier
heads
in
that
direction
from
a
bomber
with
no
date
into
my
sam
adams
glass
thanks
guys
this
one
is
engine
oil
black
with
a
thin
dark

cap
that
fades
at
a

pace
to
a

powdery

hints

in

mouth
its
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
nose
advertises
theres
a
definite
burnt
character
and
flavor
is
surprisingly
dry
compared
to
nose
hints
of
mild
coffee
with
dark
chocolate
bitterness
firm
but
not
overwhelming
enjoyable
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
bubbly
and
quenching
overall
looks
and
smells
great
though
a
bit
underwhelming
taste
overall
good
for
style
tasty
and
quenching
traditional
not
an
extreme
beer
by
any
stretch
but
good
overall
o
another
great
brew
from
rogue
the
richness
of
flavour
really
drives
this
one
home
one
of
the
better
beers
of
this
style
that
ive
had
good
but
not
stunning
perhaps
i
expected
something
different
i
think
the
style
is
more
inline
with
a
baltic
porter
o
if
you
are
expecting
a
traditional
schwarzbier
youll
be
dissapointed
but
if
you
can
adjust
your
mindset
on
the
fly
and
perhaps
pretend
that
you
are
drinking
a
coffee
porter
or
imperial
stout
youll
like
it
more
above
average
beer
very
easy
drinking
beer
its
definitely
thin
but
i
feel
like
i
could
have
had
six
or
seven
glasses
at
the
bar
it
pours
with
limited
carbonation
and
is
dark
as
the
style
would
indicate
i
had
it
next
to
the
left
hand
tnt
which
was
outrageous
in
style
and
smell
making
this
beer
seem
quite
bland
but
again
it
was
pretty
good
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
go
out
my
way
to
have
it
again
it
carried
a
rich
mouthfeel
very
nice
with
ample
carbonation
this
is
a
better
than
average
beer
it
just
doesnt
blow
me
away
like
i
expected
based
on
its
look
and
smell
this
poured
a
jet
black
motor
oil
like
color
into
a
standard
pint
glass
and
showed
a
most
remarkable
blacktan
head
several
fingers
thick
its
smell
was
sugary
like
ripe
fruit
and
its
taste
was
clearly
heavier
than
your
typical
lager
there
were
noticeable
tones
of
dark
chocolate
raisen
and
perhaps
plum
with
a
touch
of
smoked
cherry
this
made
me
think
it
would
be
an
ideal
winter
sipper
as
it
has
lots
of
charm
its
mouthfeel
felt
flat
across
the
front
of
my
tongue
with
a
mellow
hop
finish
this
really
is
a
unique
product
and
i
suggest
you
try
it
if
you
enjoy
a
porter
or
dark
lager
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
outstanding
beer
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
o
overall
a
little
disappointing
nothing
spectacular
or
overly
memorable
though
not
to
be
interpreted
as
offensive
some
more
bold
flavours
could
enhance
this
offering
though
given
the
style
i
would
suspect
it
captures
the
the
flavours
well
by
far
my
favourite
chatoe
o
good
taste
and
pretty
drinkable
with
a
relatively
low
abv
not
too
filling
either
very
clean
taste
the
grains
were
well
balanced
between
malty
sweetness
and
a
gently
roasted
flavor
the
hops
play
a
subtle
support
role
in
rounding
this
delicious
brew
mouthfeel
is

the

side
with

yeast
the
depth
of
flavor
caught
me
off

lots
of
complexity
and
layering
here
chocolate
is
really
forward
cool
in
a
lager
and
the
roast
of
the
barley
is
about
as
dark
as
it
can
be
lager
yeast
doesnt
do
quite
enough
to
lighten
it
up
and
shorten
the
finish
that
part
is
a
bit
out
of
whack
for
the
style
guidelines
but
i
almost
prefer
its
chalky
long
bitter
finish
because
i
really
like
the
flavors
here
a
touch
thin
on
the

for

it
is

of
this
in

poured
into
a

it

with
a

continued
to
sit
with

a

watery
mouthfeel
is

it
is

and
finishes
clean
all
things
considered
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
while
i
was
on
the
fence
when
i
see
it
in
the
aisle
for
the
10th
time
or
something
i
am
glad
that
i
finally
picked
it
up
on
one
of
my
infrequent
visits
to
a
bottle
shop
in
my
neighboring
state
to
the
north
o
a
great
tasting
light
stout
i
had
this
one
after
a
guinness
and
it
kicked
the
guinnesss
butt
very
tasty
and
it
wont
knock
you
out
like
an
imperial
stout

opaque
black

with
slight

it
couldve
been
a

aroma
is
pretty
disappointing
smoky
like

piece
of
toast
pretty
weak
flavor
of
dark
roast
malt
some
underlying
notes
of
plasticky
cream
ill
never
make
this
mistake
again
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
yeasty
bread
and
a
hint
of
herbs
had
a
pleasant
and
soft
aroma
the
taste
was
different
than
the
aroma
the
taste
had
a
bitter
flavor
of
roasted
malt
maybe
over
roasted
which
gave
it
a
smoky
flavor
also
a
hint
of
an
herbal
nature
for
me
not
a
lager
i
would
buy
again
my
first
disappointment
from
port
brewing
it
is
what
it
is
easy
drinking
and
a
little
on
the
boring
side
overall
not
a
bad
schwarzbier

a
rich
malty
flavor
enjoyed
this

really
enjoyed
this
one
d
not
bad
it
is
a
little
outside
of
the
traditional
german
mainstream
for
the
style
but
that
is
to
be
expected
from
port
it
is
perhaps
too
roasty
and
smoky
for
the
style
but
still
white
drinkable
in
the
end
overall
i
have
limited
experience
with
this
style
this
one
is
very
flavorful
and
full
bodied
but
still
light
going
down
making
it
very
drinkable
overall
roasty
and
tasty

one
i
would

rapidly

because
of

a
tasty
schwartzbier
an
above

low
abv
dark
beer
as
a
beer
this
is
good
but
if
the
aim
was
a
schwarzbier
then
it
seems
to
miss
the
mark
a
bit
to
be
honest
it
strikes
me
more
as
a
kind
of
smoky
porter
than
a
schwarzbier
but
for
what
it
is
it
certainly
is
consistent
nice
and
smooth
and
fairly
deep
probably
just
a
bit
too
deep
for
the
style
good
not
must
have
mouthfeel
is
excellent
medium
light
body
on
the
lighter
side
for
such
a
dark
beer
with
moderate
to
full
carbonation
very
drinkable
brew
but
maybe
not
quite
as
full
of
a
body
as
i
wouldve
liked
get
it
if
you
like
this
style
if
this
was
offered
in
12
oz
bottles
i
would
have
had
a
few
of
them
given
how
low
the
alcoholic
content
was
most
people
wouldnt
think
of
this
as
a
session
beer
but
if
a
stout
or
porter
is
too
heavy
for
you
this
would
easily
suffice
instead
this
was
a
textbook
example
of
a
style
that
isnt
widely
available
but
is
certainly
worth
a
try
nevertheless
o
wow
an
amazingly
easy
to
drink
beer
i
could
reach
for
this
all
day
o
i
give
it
a
boost
for
an
uncommon
style
just
done
well
may
the
schwarz
be
with
you
overall
not
a
bad
brew
its
not
quite
what
youd
expect
at
first
but
its
goodtasting
and
decently
interesting
overall
for
an
american
schwarzbier
this
is
very
good
i
love
the
combination
of
the
lightness
of
its
body
and
the
smokiness
the
smokiness
is
prominent
but
does
not
come
close
to
rauch
levels
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
will
get
again
overall
a
good
schwarzbier
i
dont
see
a
lot
of
american
craft
schwarzbiers
around
so
it
is
good
to
find
one
id
definitely
have
this
again
i
really
liked
this
beer
just
a
smooth
and
consistent
easy
drinking
beer
o
i
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
the
drinkability
for
these
flavors
is
quite
high
which
i
find
relatively
rare
on
tap
it
is
as
good
as
i
could
image
fulling
realizing
the
potential
i
thought
possible
when
i
had
my
first
bottle
around
one
year
ago
i
will
state
a
bit
of
bias
in
that
this
is
a
personal
favorite
combination
of
tastes
and
such
but
regardless
this
beer
should
be
sought
out
by
anyone
looking
for
a
complex
dunkel
22
oz
bottle
from
windmill
farms
market
quite
drinkable
but
definitely
on
the
blackened
side
of
the
flavor
profile
o
overall
a
black
lager
with
a
smooth
easy
yet
respectable
roastiness
that
is
quite
relaxing
d
very
drinkable
nice
balance
of
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
with
some
complexity
added
with
the
smoke
flavor
the
predominate
smell
is
burnt
white
toast
first
impression
of
the
taste
is
affected
by
the
thin
body
the
flavor
matches
the
smell
with
lots
of
burnt
bread
notes
the
aftertaste
is
dry
and
short
overall
it
reminds
me
of
a
strong
dark
euro
lager
o
overall
an
okay
beer
but
not
ports
best
offering
bosy
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
bland
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
b
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
coffee
colored
head
cocoa
and
bitter
coffee
on
the
nose
with
some
earthy
hops
pungent
nose
cocoa
nibs
and
bitter
black
chocolate
bitterness
up
front
complimented
by
a
layer
of
coffee
flavor
medium
in
body
with
thin
carbonation
deep
roasted
malt
flavor
comes
through
a
complex
brew
at
5
with
quite
a
few
layers
of
flavors
and
big
flavor
at
that
thins
out
slightly
on
the
finish
but
otherwise
good
beer
not
equal
to
my
favorite
schwartz
black
bavarian
but
tasty
and
a
surprise
in
the
ipa
and
imperial
stout
dominated
port
lineup
o
for
a
beer
weighing
in
at
5
alcohol
this
brew
has
a
very
nice
body
and
is
packed
with
flavor
one
i
look
forward
to
drinking
every
year
mighty
delicious
a
great
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
not
the
most
traditional
example
of
the
style
but
quite
enjoyable
none
the
less
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
simple
and
very
easy
to
drink
im
glad
port
brewing
finally
came
to
new
jersey
so
i
can
enjoy
brews
like
this
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
2
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
a
latticework
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
roasty
coffee
and
cocoa
bean
aromas
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
roasted
coffee
beans
and
some
cocoa
powder
a
nice
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
slightly
too
much
carbonation
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
great
schwarzbier
and
quite
a
surprise
really
i
wasnt
expecting
this
beer
to
be
so
good
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
and
it
only
packs
a
5
abv
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
also
quite
sessionable
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
nothing
special
about
this
beer
in
particular
though
it
is
quite
sessionable
overall
though
a
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
beer
one
i
would
most
certainly
drink
again
without
prompting
o
for
the
style
this
is
just
ok
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
didnt
find
a
wow
factor
or
a
flavor
that
really
pops
in
this
one
would
drink
again
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
super
drinkable
and
approachable
schwarzbier
that
would
definitely
be
a
goto
if
i
didnt
live
12000
kms
away
very
impressed
by
this
cannot
think
of
a
better
dark
lager
that
ive
come
across
easy
to
drink
complex
full
of
flavour
and
aroma
the
port
brewing
black
lager
that
i
picked
up
is
called
midnight
sessions
name
must
have
changed
over
time
the
appeance
is
great
dark
opaque
nice
tan
head
which
seems
to
be
lacing
the
smell
include
roast
with
hint
of
espresso
and
hops
the
taste
is
common
of
most
black
lagers
lightmedium
body
with
good
roasty
tones
with
touchs
of
coffee
caramel
and
hops
that
help
to
clean
the
pallet
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
as
well
very
easy
to
drink
with
not
overbearing
abv
i
am
guessing
they
changed
the
name
because
it
is
a
great
sesson
lager
overall
a
very
good
beer
all
in
all
a
surprise
not
a
session
beer
even
at
5
pours
a
dark
as
night

which
leaves
a
two

touch

and
finished
like
a
nice
black
roasty
expresso
and
overall
i
definately
would
this
again
and
another
great
lager
from
this
great
brewery
i
see
why
the
beer
was
originally
called
moonlit
sessions
its
the
kind
of
thing
you
could
stay
up
drinking
until
way
past
your
bed
time
this
may
arguably
be
the
most
agreeable
widely
approachable
offering
this
side
of
the
colour
spectrum
thats
what
you
get
combining
a
german
brewers
engineering
with
the
ingenuity
and
skills
of
a
true
american
artisan
overall
i
find
it
to
be
quite
good
and
is
another
great
addition
to
the
port
lineup
a
world
of
flavor
in
such
a
low
abv
package
really
an
incredible
treat
a
delicious
black
lager
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
just
had
higher
hopes
was
looking
for
more
depth
in
flavor
and
there
was
virtually
none
its
seems
like
a
homebrewers
first
attempt
at
the
style
o
moderately
drinkable
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
pours
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
malty
and
hints
of
caramel
in
the
taste
caramel
chocolate
notes
and
a
hint
of
coffee
quite
porter
like
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
coffee
and
chocolate
aftertaste
more
of
a
porter
than
lager
and
or
schwartzbier
with
the
big
coffee
chocolate
roast
but
nice
nonetheless
drink
a
little
bit
different
than
i
thought
tasty
malty
and
a
little
dark
hops
unexpected
flavors
but
probably
not
coming
back
o
quite
a
good
brew
for
the
style
a
bit
all
over
the
place
but
still
a
good
brew
thanks
for
the
great
trade
shogokawada
o
i
picked
this
one
up
on
a
whim
and
it
didnt
disappoint
i
plan
on
trying
this
style
a
lot
more
throughout
the
summer
tasty
black
lager
pours
a
nice
opaque
black
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
nice
roasty
aroma
nutty
with
some
coffee
bitterness
similar
taste
big
roasty
malts
coffee
and
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
raisin
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
poured
from
the
bomber
a
jet
black
color
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
on
top
aromas
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
smoke
on
the
palate
this
one
was
medium
bodied
and
fairly
crisp
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
bitter
chocolate
nuts
and
smoke
overall
i
like
this
beer
good
for
the
style
cant
say
that
im
a
schwarsbier
enthusiast
but
if
im
in
the
mood
ill
look
for
this
guy
again
o
generally
black
lagers
dont
do
too
much
for
me
but
im
really
enjoying
this
one
i
like
the
flavor
profile
and
the
abv
point
makes
this
a
very
good
beer
one
thats
worth
getting
if
you
seeit
around
o
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
wish
i
hadnt
shared
the
bottle
as
i
could
have
done
the
whole
thing
precisely
what
i
was
looking
for
tonight
my
favorite
dark
lager
that
i
have
tried
supremely
sessionable
and
refreshing
im
kinda
bummed
i
never
gave
this
a
try
before
because
i
think
its
gonna
be
a
new
staple
in
my
regular
line
up
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
drinking
beer
i
am
very
hardpressed
to
call
this
a
schwarzbier
it
is
a
mostly
malty
beer
with
some
toasty
notes
and
other
components
that
make
up
a
schwarz
but
there
isnt
enough
toasty
notes
to
push
it
over
to
a
schwarzbier
it
is
really
rich
so
is
more
like
a
mild
porter
fermented
with
a
lager
yeast
or
something
again
it
is
a
good
beer
but
dont
go
looking
for
a
schwarzbier
with
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
from
port
this
brews
taste
is
confident
and
solid
yet
delicate
and
restrained
a
great
schwarzbier
that
definitely
respects
the
styles
heritage
id
buy
it
again
for
sure
aroma
is
rich
and
smoky
with
undertones
of
malt
molasses
yeast
and
coffee
very
like
a
good
stout
or
porter
it
pours
a
nearopaque
sable
with
a
thick
fluffy
fairly
persistent
light
tan
head
flavor
is
mainly
malty
with
an
undertone
of
roast
coffee
and
hints
of
molasses
texture
is
fizzy
as
cola
dancing
on
the
tongue
and
all
the
way
down
the
beer
had
a
lighter
feel
to
it
and
perhaps
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
light
the
beer
was
smooth
clean
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
the
second
beer
for
this
style
and
i
am
quickly
determining
that
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
not
a
bad
style
just
not
for
me
but
i
can
appreciate
it
and
will
probably
try
to
give
some
of
the
higher
rated
ones
a
try
the
body
is
very
good
solid
but
not
heavy
and
crisp
drinkability
is
very
good
a
22
went
down
very
easily
overall
i
found
this
to
the
best
beer
ive
yet
tried
from
this
brewery
worth
seeking
out
theres
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
the
sweet
malt
stick
around
a
bit
too
long
to
make
this
a
session
beer
for
me
id
more
likely
turn
to
a
full
sail
session
black
final
thought
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
damned
good
schwarzbier
right
there
with
duck
rabbits
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
mouth
feel
is
lush
and
decadent
quite
drinkable
as
well
decided
to
pick
one
of
these
bottles
up
before
they
changed
the
name
of
it
pours
black
with
an
extremely
tiny
tan
head
that
disappears
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
scent
is
burnt
toast
chocolate
cocoa
sweet
malts
and
coffee
this
taste
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
when
i
saw
this
was
a
lager
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
pour
black
nor
was
i
expecting
it
to
smell
and
taste
like
a
porter
i
get
tons
of
chocolate
cocoa
flavors
with
light
hoppiness
the
burnt
malts
flavors
complement
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
quite
well
flavors
all
blend
together
great
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
refreshing
i
find
the
mouthfeel
the
most
distinguishable
thing
between
this
beer
and
a
porter
ale
drinkability
is
high
di
like
this
beer
nice
and
complex
very
different
for
the
style
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
probably
a
great
food
beer
nope
this
feels
like
something
of
a
miss
to
me
it
has
some
pleasant
characters
but
some
slightly
unpleasant
ones
as
well
not
ports
best
offering
thats
for
sure
d
a
good
tasting
beer
just
a
little
different
than
most
schwarzbiers
that
i
have
had
this
is
a
quite
good
offering
from
port
brewing
a
flavorful
schwarbier
that
is
quite
sessionable
and
pleasant
to
drink
drinks
so
easy
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
tad
too
much
coffee
but
still
wish
i
could
pick
this
up
on
a
regular
basis
d
i
know
people
all
the
time
talk
about
port
brewing
in
a
negative
light
i
have
yet
to
have
something
terrible
from
them
and
to
be
honest
this
beer
was
fantastic
port
please
keep
doing
what
you
are
doing
and
i
will
keep
trading
for
you
until
you
decided
to
come
into
indiana
cough
cough
medium
high
carbonation
thin
body
with
flavors
encompassing
bitter
chocolate
roast
barley
and
a
coffee
middle
bready
as
well
but
smooth
and
effervescent
on
the
palate
moderate
bitterness
with
only
the
faintest
hint
of
astringency
finish
is
medium
in
length
there
is
definitely
a
crisp
and
clean
pale
malt
support
structure
in
this
one
another
good
offering
from
port
appealing
quality
beer
from
port
brewing
not
my
favorite
from
them
but
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
medium
bodied
and
rich
dark
roasted
feel
and
creamy
not
a
bold
as
i
would
imagine
very
smoothe
and
very
drinkable
so
yeah
i
totally
bought
this
by
accident
when
seeking
out
hop
15
for
some
friends
just
grabbed
the
wrong
bottle
and
did
not
realize
it
till
i
was
in
my
car
oh
well
on
to
the
review
pours
completely
black
and
quite
opaque
very
stout
like
with
a
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
and
leaves
just
a
ring
around
the
glass
it
has
okay
lacing
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
aroma
is
full
on
roasty
goodness
with
plenty
of
coffee
and
cocoa
notes
not
really
much
else
showing
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
also
very
roasty
and
full
of
coffee
like
flavors
from
the
dark
malts
as
well
tons
of
bitter
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
licorice
the
malt
character
is
that
of
brown
sugar
with
a
nice
toffee
edge
to
it
exceedingly
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
herbal
hoppiness
and
a
very
firm
bitterness
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
flavorful
schwarzbiers
i
have
had
it
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
stout
even
with
its
smooth
clean
character
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
astringent
but
not
at
all
unpleasant
it
lingers
long
on
the
palate
with
some
nice
residual
sweetness
pretty
drinkable
but
not
as
much
as
some
other
dark
lagers
i
have
had
a
surprising
beer
and
one
that
i
am
glad
i
partook
of
d
really
nice
this
went
down
a
bit
too
easily
i
will
definately
drink
this
again
here
is
yet
another
top
notch
brew
from
port
d
a
very
good
lager
tasty
and
full
bodied
yet
clean
and
drinkable
nice
id
like
it
a
little
lighter
actually
but
a
good
brew
md
light
body
but
head
and
heavy
carbonation
stay
with
this
the
whole
way
through
d
a
solid
and
enjoyable
schwarzbier
easy
drinking
and
utterly
sessionable
nothing
detracting
and
nothing
spectacular
just
another
fine
offering
from
the
folks
at
port
brewing
a
terrific
value
at
less
than
6
per
bomber

really
dark

is
easy

it
quick
and
did
not
feel
it
in
the
least
5
beer
is
alright
with
me
will
drink
again
with
the
carb
issues
portla
gets
in
a
bottle
im
fortunate
to
find
this
stuff
on
draft
cant
risk
it
this
is
good
beer
for
a
being
called
lager
this
is
very
dark
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
outstanding
either
lacks
depth
in
my
opinion
after
the
coffee
taste
there
is
not
much
else
following
that
up
in
my
opinion
drinkability
for
the
style
this
beer
has
a
bold
flavor
profile
that
keeps
you
wanting
more
great
on
tap
worth
a
try
drinkability
not
good
not
bad
this
was
fine
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
anyone
chewy
full
body
with
a
nice
lactic
creamy
feel
along
with
a
beautiful
smoked
malt
character
that
isnt
overpowering
at
all
deep
roasted
flavor
with
hints
of
nut
toffee
chocolate
caramel
and
burnt
toast
slightly
bitter
hops
provide
the
perfect
compliment
to
the
smokey
roasted
notes
there
is
also
a
subtle
dark
fruit
presence
especially
dark
cherry
thatnprovides
a
nice
sweetnessto
the
deep
roasted
notes
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
and
extremely
quaffable
this
is
a
nice
introduction
to
smoked
lagers
no
too
overpowering
with
a
lot
of
comlexity
balancing
it
out
but
ruachsmoked
beers
fans
will
love
this
beer
highly
recommended
d
id
definitely
have
this
again
on
tap
only
though
d
really
enjoyed
this
beer
bought
this
beer
cause
i
forgot
if
i
had
tried
it
before
most
likely
i
did
but
i
just
have
a
bad
memory
pours
deep
black
with
a
slight
head
aroma
is
sweet
malty
and
roasted
more
like
a
porter
the
flavor
is
malty
woody
surprising
robust
with
cherry
and
chocolate
this
is
much
more
like
a
porter
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
milky
not
bad
at
all
nothing
that
jumps
out
though
subtle
and
enjoyable
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
head
leaving
little
lacing
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
coffee
beans
nuts
toffee
taste
is
of
bitter
dark
roasted
malts
and
coffee
backed
by
a
toffee
sweet
and
nut
flavor
borders
on
stout
in
its
profile
light
bodied
almost
watery
and
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
a
nice
brew
nothing
spectacular
but
does
a
bolder
version
of
the
style
well
taste
is
very
nice
dry
toast
dark
caramel
hint
some
coffee
light
sweetness
with
light
singedleaf
roastycoffee
bitterness
initially
it
tends
slightly
to
the
sweet
side
before
quickly
becoming
dry
with
a
flavourful
dryroasty
finish
and
dryish
aftertaste
leaning
slightly
to
peppery
bitter
side
with
dark
chocolate
for
a
schwarzbier
its
not
to
style
but
thats
what
makes
port
brewing
co
so
good
they
brew
some
really
unique
stuff
d
aside
from
the
phenols
and
the
astringency
this
was
a
good
beer
the
complexity
is
there
but
it
appears
the
mash
was
too
hot
all
4s

different
take
on
a
schwarzbier
this
was
a
pretty
interesting
schwarzbier
i
was
definitely
expecting
something
a
little
lighter
on
the
palate
but
midnight
sessions
was
relatively
dense
with
some
pretty
vivacious
malt
character
pours
a
dark
char
color
with
a
cream
head
nominal
lacing
lots
of
roasted
malt
character
for
the
style
with
some
pretty
nice
smoke
notes
as
well
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
that
balances
the
malt
notes
nicely
a
bit
less
crispness
than
i
was
expecting
but
the
nose
was
still
pretty
pleasant
the
body
is
pretty
dense
for
the
style
with
a
nice
smoke
and
roast
quality
to
the
malt
although
the
hop
qualities
were
not
as
pronounced
to
me
as
some
other
posts
enough
bitterness
was
present
to
balance
out
the
malt
allinall
a
really
nice
pour
and
light
enough
to
make
me
want
another
once
the
first
disappeared
i
really
like
this
one
but
knock
it
a
few
points
for
being
off
style
in
my
opinion
o
nice
session
beer
a
little
harsh
on
the
roasty
taste
but
very
drinkable
another
amazing
beer
from
port
brewing
its
difficult
to
find
a
good
americanmade
schwarzbier
on
the
shelf
midnight
sessions
is
made
for
sessions
not
just
for
midnight
but
for
any
time
of
day
damn
tasty
stuff
now
its
my
new
favorite
of
the
port
brewing
line
pours
black
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
good
retention
and
a
light
coat
of
lacing
smells
and
taste
of
roast
malts
some
earthy
and
citrus
peel
hops
some
smoke
and
a
bit
of
yeast
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
nice
low
carbonation
leaves
a
coat
of
roasty
hops
low
bitterness
certainly
a
nice
laid
back
roasty
lager
at
a
good
price
could
session
this
one
for
sure
this
was
super
easy
to
drink
nice
low
abv
great
flavor
with
nothing
really
dominating
i
drank
this
rather
quickly
overall
a
good
schwarzbier
that
is
more
bitter
than
most
d
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
definitely
would
have
it
again
and
could
easily
make
this
a
goto
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
roasty
like
this
nice
to
have
a
good
dark
lager
brewed
locally
d
drinkable
but
not
something
id
turn
to
for
a
schwarzbier
its
light
enough
that
id
be
able
to
enjoy
a
few
should
the
mood
for
multiple
smooth
smokey
beers
strike
me
i
was
told
to
give
it
a
try
and
i
did
not
to
impressed
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
bomber
bottles
every
night
at
midnight
earlier
or
later
terrific
overall
an
excellent
schwarzbier
that
exceeds
expectations
and
demands
returned
helpings
especially
for
a
5
beer
overall
this
was
a
very
well
made
beer
i
cant
say
how
to
style
it
was
being
so
dominant
in
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
but
it
doesnt
really
matter
to
me
as
long
as
it
is
good
this
actually
reminds
me
a
lot
of
some
duck
rabbit
beers
maybe
the
porter
pretty
weak
effort
by
port
here
in
my
opinion
i
like
most
of
their
offerings
but
this
just
seems
like
a
bit
of
an
afterthought
beer
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
session
beer
like
the
name
says
i
am
just
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
3
5
d
like
i
said
before
this
is
okay
but
not
my
schwartzbier
of
choice
d
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
its
sort
of
a
stoutschwarzbier
hybrid
in
presentation
and
certainly
a
nice
change
of
pace
on
a
late
night
22oz
bottle
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
roasted
malt
burnt
and
caramelized
sugars
and
light
acidity
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
has
plenty
of
dark
chocolate
in
a
light
and
drinkable
package
lightly
burnt
roasty
finish
with
light
hops
this
is
quite
flavorful
for
5
but
drinks
very
easily
with
only
a
light
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
fatiguing
the
palate
this
one
pours
opaque
dark
dark
brown
with
two
inches
of
tan
head
the
aroma
is
huge
chocolate
charred
malt
taste
is
mellow
as
youd
expect
from
the
stylechocolate
coffee
charred
malt
the
charred
flavor
tends
to
stand
out
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
despite
the
huge
head
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
the
taste
is
of
the
nose
some
roastiness
with
a
very
slight
bitterness
that
is
detracting
for
the
style
there
are
slight
hops
but
minimal
decent
black
lager
but
not
great
d
good
drinkability
as
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
note
this
is
before
i
started
hearing
that
the
recent
batches
of
older
viscosity
ba
santas
little
helper
etc
are
still
coming
out
flat
i
was
willing
to
give
portla
another
chance
thus
why
i
still
went
and
bought
this
bomber
and
knowing
that
this
is
from
the
second
runnings
of
serpent
stout
i
was
considering
trying
that
too
but
now
im
unsure
if
i
want
to
keep
supporting
them
they
need
to
get
their
act
together
this
texture
and
a
mild
abv
make
it
really
easy
to
consume
and
this
night
surfing
inspired
german
lager
is
worldclass
and
definitely
worth
the
search
bomber
from
ledgers
nice
super
dark
brown
color
with
auburn
highlights
decent
cap
of
tan
foam
but
its
a
little
fizzy
roasted
malt
aroma
grains
sweetened
coffee
brownie
mix
flavor
is
not
as
good
onedimensionally
roasty
and
a
little
ashy
at
the
end
some
extremely
dark
chocolate
creeps
into
the
aftertaste
as
well
body
is
too
thin
for
sure
not
bad
the
aroma
alone
makes
it
better
than
several
german
schwarzbiers
ive
had
side
note
more
brewers
need
to
focus
on
a
quality
schwarz
it
is
the
session
beer
for
the
dark
beer
folks
i
like
the
style
and
buying
the
bomber
at
gordons
in
watham
i
was
a
bottle
past
my
12packer
for
the
plane
hence
an
enjoyable
and
informative
sharing
with
jeff
at
jaspars
in
nashua
roasty
aroma
black
body
with
permanent
offwhite
little
head
with
a
great
drinkability
and
this
is
10
minutes
in
the
fridge
on
a
warm
day
balanced
with
a
tad
of
fruitiness
and
complexity
in
the
roasted
black
malt
22oz
bottle
for
a
very
reasonable
price
i
bought
mine
at
ledgers
in
berkeley
pours
a
slightly
murky
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
pancake
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
very
roasty
aroma
almost
coffeelike
this
surprised
me
not
your
average
dark
lager
the
taste
is
also
quite
roasty
and
there
is
a
fairly
earthyhoppy
presence
as
well
add
in
some
light
bubblegum
flavors
some
more
coffee
notes
and
a
light
chewy
graininess
and
you
have
a
pretty
interesting
beer
there
is
a
bit
of
a
fade
on
the
finish
grainy
and
mediumbodied
in
the
mouth
i
altogether
found
this
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
drinkability
is
stellar
as
expected
light
but
full
somewhere
between
a
slow
sipper
and
a
session
beer
this
beer
is
whatever
you
want
it
to
be
love
it
overall
this
was
much
roastier
than
other
schwarzbiers
ive
had
though
i
havent
had
many
still
it
was
balanced
by
the
hops
and
chocolate
flavors
worth
a
shot
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
didnt
hang
around
long
the
nose
was
full
of
coffee
and
roasted
barley
smells
that
is
where
the
style
portion
ends
because
when
i
drank
this
beer
it
was
more
like
an
ale
then
a
lager
lagers
should
be
crisp
and
clean
tasting
dark
or
not
and
this
was
more
like
a
porter
dont
got
me
wrong
i
liked
this
thought
it
had
all
kinds
of
great
flavors
i
just
wanted
a
schwarzbier
and
this
wasnt
it
wont
stop
me
from
drinking
another
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
i
could
sip
these
all
night
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
type
beer
and
i
am
curious
if
this
is
a
fair
representative
of
that
style
would
like
to
try
other
beers
from
port
brewing
and
i
would
also
like
to
try
another
schwarzbier
as
well
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
a
bit
too
much
for
me
this
is
an
excellent
schwarzbier
with
high
sessionability
port
midnight
sessions
lager
is
a
love
story
a
hearty
porter
meets
a
delicate
lager
on
eharmony
com
or
somewhere
and
they
fall
in
love
its
a
healthy
relationship
they
share
and
compromise
where
they
have
to
the
porter
gets
the
appearance
it
pours
a
dark
impenetrable
brown
with
a
red
hue
light
fluffy
and
wispy
mocha
head
sits
atop
and
stays
for
a
short
while
it
shies
away
to
a
modest
covering
like
the
morning
dew
on
the
grass
it
is
beautiful
and
noticeable
and
also
delicate
its
aroma
is
dominated
by
roasted
malts
and
coffee
tones
the
crispness
and
smooth
lager
qualities
combine
with
the
coffee
and
roastiness
in
the
taste
its
an
alliance
unlike
china
the
the
ussr
in
the
1950s
there
is
no
ego
war
here
no
ambivalence
just
harmony
the
mouthfeel
is
like
listening
to
bob
marley
peaceful
jovial
pensive
mellow
but
not
jamaican
the
drinkability
is
superb
one
of
the
finest
porters
ive
had
oh
its
a
black
lager
well
then
its
still
one
of
the
finest
porters
ive
had
blacker
than
black
and
visibly
thick
as
it
generates
a
fat
dense
dark
brown
head
when
poured
into
the
glass
extreme
roasted
aromas
are
evident
at
a
distance
of
three
feet
and
a
balanced
dose
of
roasted
malt
along
with
a
hoppy
bite
as
it
goes
down
dense
body
but
still
quite
drinkable
especially
with
the
5
abv
as
black
lagers
go
this
one
isnt
at
least
not
compared
with
the
others
ive
had
stack
this
one
up
against
berkshires
draymans
porter
or
even
a
good
bottle
from
the
uk
definitely
worth
a
try
it
smells
like
pencil
shavings
d
its
certainly
drinkable
but
its
a
drinkable
style
and
theres
a
bit
too
much
bitter
astringency
in
the
aftertaste
for
me
to
give
it
a
higher
score
d
the
smoky
peaty
like
flavors
coat
the
mouth
a
bit
making
me
go
a
bit
slow
between
sips
the
low
abv
and
thick
creamy
nature
help
to
counteract
that
a
bit
though
overall
a
good
but
not
great
beer
love
the
style
so
was
a
bit
disappointed
always
on
the
lookout
for
a
good
schwarzbier
mild
recommend
if
you
can
easily
get
it
for
me
id
try
another
just
to
make
sure
my
sample
was
good
it
did
go
thru
2
shipments
but
unless
it
improved
itd
be
a
one
and
done
looks
like
an
english
stout
black
with
dark
brown
highlights
not
much
of
a
head
after
the
pour
and
no
foam
or
film
chocolate
just
a
hint
of
non
dairy
creamer
an
overall
great
roasted
to
burnt
malt
aroma
extremely
roasted
almost
burnt
malts
add
a
note
of
coffee
to
the
dark
chocolate
taste
with
maybe
a
touch
of
milk
the
palate
is
grainy
and
dry
but
pretty
full
each
sip
leaves
a
little
prickle
on
the
tongue
great
sessionable
and
very
flavorful
schwarzbier
verdict
not
sure
why
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
so
dark
given
the
name
its
like
a
big
stout
with
an
unexpected
finish
and
without
the
alcohol
md
medium
to
full
body
not
huge
though
easy
to
go
down
but
probably
not
quite
as
a
good
a
representative
of
the
style
as
say
the
sam
adams
version
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
just
too
much
like
a
porter
when
i
wanted
a
nice
black
lager
a
stout
for
those
times
you
want
to
have
several
nicely
handled
with
an
american
twist
on
a
firmly
german
style
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
can
get
it
you
wouldnt
think
house
of
wax
with
paris
hilton
was
any
good
but
it
was
decent
d
goes
down
easy
definitely
appropriate
for
a
midnight
session
which
is
right
about
when
i
finished
it
the
roasty
bitterness
gets
a
bit
tiring
but
the
carbonation
and
abv
make
it
eminently
drinkable
drinkability
is
great
a
really
nice
schwarzbier
big
flavor
without
being
to
heavy
or
robust
if
this
was
available
in
more
reasonably
priced
sixpacks
it
would
be
a
great
session
ale
bottle
poured
a
deep
black
color
lager
with
a
large
dirty
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sumptuous
black
coffee
with
some
dry
roasted
malt
notes
is
really
enjoyable
taste
is
a
very
nice
mix
between
some
dry
coffee
notes
and
some
roasted
malt
with
some
subtle
black
chocolate
notes
body
is
full
with
nice
creamy
notes
and
good
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
very
well
done
and
perfect
representation
of
the
style
really
good
stuff
and
one
i
will
buy
again
the
only
knock
is
that
i
did
enjoy
more
on
draft
than
from
the
bottle
overall
impression
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
a
nice
example
of
it
heavy
on
the
roasted
flavors
and
highly
drinkable
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
several
of
these
any
time
of
year
this
a
somewhat
drinkable
brew
especially
if
youre
looking
for
something
in
between
a
lager
and
a
stout
normally
im
not
but
for
those
who
like
this
sort
of
thing
it
will
probably
make
you
happy
d
as
one
who
really
likes
smoke
i
was
quite
happy
with
this
one
no
major
complaints
just
wouldnt
have
minded
a
bit
less
esters
in
this
one
a
fine
american
schwarzbier
and
price
seemed
right
at

had
with
some
hoch
ybrig
firm
cheese
raw
cow
milk
bathed
in
chardonnay
and
it
seemed
to
work
brought
out
sweet
malt
and
hay
in
the
beer
and
seemed
to
match
strength
but
im
an
amateur
t
m
d
dark
chocolate
nice
malts
but
on
the
lighter
side
body
is
suitable
for
the
flavours
another
nice
one
from
port
and
id
like
to
try
it
again
drinkability
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
extraordinarily
sessionable
at
5
0
abv
rich
and
tasty
while
not
being
overly
sweet
or
onedimensional
and
creamy
and
easydrinking
this
one
comes
recommended
interesting
solid
brew
i
liked
this
batch
more
than
when
i
tried
the
moonlit
sessions
during
the
summertime
would
work
well
with
some
barbecue
update
i
had
this
one
again
almost
a
year
later
and
it
is
still
a
very
good
drinker
i
got
more
from
the
nose
than
i
noted
in
my
original
review
but
otherwise
the
flavors
and
smells
are
right
on
not
a
bad
schwarzbier
but
i
have
had
better
need
to
make
it
a
bit
sweeter
so
more
of
the
chocolate
comes
through
dark
black
with
an
aroma
that
is
so
roasty
it
makes
me
think
of
a
stout
which
is
no
surprise
given
that
this
is
a
byproduct
of
serpents
stout
roasty
flavor
and
reminds
me
again
of
a
stout
but
is
distinctly
different
excellent
drinkability
and
a
really
robust
flavor
make
this
very
easy
to
throw
back
i
should
mention
that
my
bottle
says
midnight
sessions
the
label
matches
the
photo
though
i
am
fairly
confident
its
the
same
beer
perhaps
they
had
to
change
the
name
for
one
reason
or
another
im
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
drinkability
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
a
bit
to
roasted
and
smoky
for
my
tastes
for
a
schwartzbier
even
a
great
brewery
cant
make
me
love
this
style
that
said
its
a
good
not
great
example
the
mouthfeel
is
really
excellent
not
too
heavy
or
bready
but
the
smokiness
is
definitely
a
little
much
sort
of
like
a
smoky
guinness
or
even
the
old
viscosity
wout
the
bourbon
booziness
an
interesting
beer
but
once
is
enough
for
me
this
brew
poured
a
nice
two
finger
head
with
good
retention
the
aroma
of
fresh
gorund
coffee
and
black
licorice
on
the
nose
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
hop
bite
and
piney
resin
flavor
that
quickly
fades
into
a
heavy
malt
backbone
with
more
intense
coffee
flavors
the
drinkability
is
smooth
with
a
good
long
finish
cheers
to
pizza
port
for
making
a
schwarzbier
im
a
little
confused
about
the
name
because
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
midnight
sessions
that
i
had
so
not
sure
if
it
is
the
same
beer
or
not
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
with
some
coffee
notes
flavor
follows
with
the
coffee
and
chocolate
up
front
with
some
residual
sweetness
everything
is
balanced
out
nicely
not
my
favorite
port
beer
but
good
nonetheless
d
easy
to
drink
for
sure
the
smoky
taste
does
get
a
bit
overpowering
im
becoming
a
big
fan
of
these
types
of
beersall
the
flavor
of
a
stout
but
not
weighed
down
by
the
heavy
mouthfeel
this
isnt
as
good
as
the
death
taxes
i
recently
had
but
still
tasty
stuff
i
love
it
when
i
find
this
beer
my
favorite
schwarzbier
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
dry
and
sticky
mouthfeel
a
truly
sessionable
schwarzbier
i
have
little
experience
with
the
style
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
wow
black
pour
with
a
cascading
tan
head
rich
aroma
of
coffee
cocoa
cream
and
roasted
malt
taste
of
the
same
plus
cereal
caramel
and
a
nutty
smokiness
bittersweet
offering
with
the
hops
and
caramelchocolate
flavors
balancing
each
other
out
never
disappointed
dwarfs
other
schwarzbiers
overall
a
damn
good
session
lager
loving
the
brews
coming
out
of
portla
d
pretty
easily
drinkable
and
low
abv
pretty
damn
flavorful
for
a
5
brew
this
is
an
excellent
schwarzbier
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
highly
recommended
notes
from
42508
thanks
again
numbeercruncher
should
be
something
more
than
lager
on
the
label
either
say
its
a
black
lager
or
a
schwarzbier
someone
expecting
a
lager
might
be
very
disappointed
with
this
one
but
i
guess
thats
part
of
the
beauty
of
a
port
brew
always
a
drinking
adventure
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
beer
has
all
of
the
characteristics
to
make
it
a
sessionable
dark
lager
but
i
think
that
there
are
more
flavorful
beers
in
that
category
d
the
beer
tastes
bigger
than
it
is
a
5
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
that
i
could
sip
all
day
very
good
brew
from
port
my
first
i
have
tried
from
them
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
three
i
have
drinkability
although
this
brew
sort
of
turned
out
being
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
i
was
expecting
it
was
a
amazingly
nice
surprise
i
really
like
how
it
turned
out
to
be
light
and
unsweet
i
think
that
really
helped
the
drinkability
a
lot
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
i
really
appreciate
being
able
to
try
thanks
again
tom
d
lots
of
bang
for
your
cuk
with
the
flavor
in
this
brew
would
make
a
great
session
beer
very
drinkable
dark
beer
worth
seeking
a
full
flavored
roasty
mix
that
went
down
way
too
quickly
this
is
very
solid
example
of
the
schwarbier
style
now
excuse
me
while
i
go
find
another
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
nice
burnt
tan
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
fresh
brewed
coffee
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
grass
tastes
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
followed
by
bitter
coffee
grass
and
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
finish
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
great
roasty
flavors
but
not
too
overpowering
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
bitterness
seems
low
enough
in
alcohol
to
session
and
is
easy
to
drink
d
great
beer
all
around
although
it
leaves
a
bit
of
burnt
aftertaste
thanks
brewbakere
for
the
opportunity
and
to
mdaschaf
for
the
chance
to
revisit
d
absolutely
amazing
complex
and
sessionable
shame

brew
isnt

a
drinking
experience
this
brew
is
a
must
try
moon
lit
is
a
quality
and
sessionable
schwarzbier
from
port
one
i
would
like
to
see
around
here
because
i
get
in
the
mood
often
for
schwarzbiers
and
there
arent
many
examples
around
these
parts
i
wouldnt
hesitate
picking
this
one
up
if
i
lived
in
the
distribution
area
thanks

for
the
treat

thats
no
surprise
given
the
brewery
that
created
it
although
it
might
not
measure
up
to
the
styles
heavy
hitters
its
a
dark
lager
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
and
again
and
again
a
very
good
schwarz
from
port
brewing
company
glad
i
had
the

try
it

towards

nice
but
is
a
bit
heavy
for
the

is
dampered
by
the
thickness
of
this
one
overall
very
heavy
and
big
for
the
style
but
a
very
good
brew
one
i
would
surely
return
to
if
it
were
readily
available
big
thanks
to
tayner
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
and
all
the
other
fabulous
beers
she
has
sent
me
d
very
interesting
beer
and
glad
to
try
it
would
get
tiring
fast
though
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
ruby
edges
quickly
diminishing
foam
smells
like
a
schwarzbier
should
with
notes
dried
chocolate
cocoa
and
dried
coffee
grounds
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
schwarzbier
dryness
and
notes
of
dried
chocolate
and
fruit
lets
not
get
carried
away
here
its
a
well
made
beer
i
think
kidd
lager
is
better
notes
from
what
i
heard
this
was
brewed
from
the
second
runnings
of
the
serpent
stout
it
does
show
some
stout
characteristics
but
is
recognizably
a
great
schwarzbier
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
minimal
uneven
head
over
the
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
what
head
there
is
slowly
recedes
to
the
sides
of
the
surface
with
average
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
dark
malts
coffee
and
an
underlying
fruitiness
taste
follows
the
nose
with
slightly
acrid
coffee
lingering
after
the
swallow
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
pretty
good
overall
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
port
but
not
bad
at
all
port
did
a
really
nice
job
with
this
one
im
really
impressed
i
was
expecting
a
good
beer
but
this
is
actually
quite
a
bit
better
than
i
was
expecting
im
really
not
sure
how
the
flavor
could
be
improved
perhaps
it
could
be
a
little
more
complex
but
that
could
potentially
weaken
whats
a
pretty
good
damn
beer
as
it
is
check
it
out
for
yourself
good
stuff
d
tons
of
flavor
for
a
low
abv
beer
excellent
session
beer
notes
a
nice
shift
from
the
usual
hoppy
beers
i
regularly
consume
my
first
port
brewing
beer
but
hopefully
not
my
last
definitely
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
geez
louise
this
things
more
roasty
than
some
stouts
yet
it
still
retains
a
pleasingly
crisp
body
good
stuff
d
a
tasty
sessionable
schwarzbier
i
wish
more
breweries
would
make
this
style
big
thanks
to
himerman
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
tasty
treat
as
part
of
the
bif

just
great
chocolate

it
mellow
roasted

nice

very
full
and
malty
body
a
great
great
beer
at
5
so
the
label
states
the
whole
package
makes
for
a
great
schwarzbier
the
great
flavors
and
full
body
almost
make
me
think
of
it
as
a
porter
would
do
this
again
and
again
and
again
notes
great
stuff
highly
recommended
it
has
a
light
body
which
i
expected
the
carbonation
is
fairly
brisk
also
expected
and
it
finishes
with
a
bitter
bite
from
the
roasted
and
dark
chocolate
malt
a
very
nice
and
quite
bitter
brew
man
this
a
big
beer
for
5
alcochol
just
loads
of
coffee
grinds
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
flavors
a
hint
of
caramel
comes
through
with
a
bit
of
a
piney
hop
on
the
finish
bready
in
the
middle
with
a
mollasses
touch
very
dry
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
a
good
beer
but
not
neccesarily
one
i
would
session
very
complex
schwarzbier
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
is
extremely
sessionable
though
the
sticker
price
here
in
pa
might
be
a
bit
much
for
most
to
have
a
true
session
with
recommended
this
is
a
style
that
i
dont
get
to
visit
often
so
it
was
nice
to
see
a
brewery
like
port
brewing
one
pours
a
cool
black
color
with
very
minimal
heading
mostly
just
a
small
white
lacing
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
aroma
has
a
very
big
presence
of
cola
smoke
and
roast
taste
is
roasted
with
bits
of
mocha
and
chocolate
coming
through
here
and
there
body
is
medium
with
some
very
nice
carbonation
in
there
to
keep
the
feel
lively
at
first
the
drinking
of
this
beer
seemed
like
a
bit
of
a
chore
but
after
one
glass
i
kept
going
back
for
more
by
the
time
i
was
done
with
the
bomber
i
was
craving
more
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
dark
beer
i
knew
port
wouldnt
let
me
down
with
this
one
grab
one
or
two
if
ya
see
it
around
cheers
a
wellmade
effort
of
an
entirely
underrated
style
shows
considerably
more
complexity
than
a
traditionally
lightbodied
lager
its
smoky
nature
lends
itself
to
savoring
only
1
or
2
but
an
enjoyable

or
2

my
oberon
weizen
glass
poured
an
opaque

edges
one
inch
tan
colored
head
eventually
settled
into
a
thin
consistent

scents
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
some
thin
lacing
with
decent
consistency
present
during
the
session
nose
consistent
with
flavors
as
well
as
the
presence
of
coffee
and
some
lingering
hops
bitterness
at
the
finish
not
quite
mediumbodied
with
a
lively
mouthfeel
and
a
mild
carbonation
burn
consistency
is
somewhat
similar
to
a
stout
but
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
ive
been
drinking
quite
a
few
schwarzbiers
lately
and
this
one
is
quite
good
however
not
the
best
ive
had
a
little
to
much
lingering
bitterness
makes
this
less
of
a
go
to
for
me
relative
to
the
style
d
at
5
and
the
amazing
flavor
this
beer
is
a
great
session
brew
extremely
drinkable
i
like
this
beer
and
while
i
could
drink
several
pints
in
a
sitting
it
might
be
wise
to
change
it
up
as
the
flavor
gets
a
bit
one
dimensional
after
while
overall
recommended
d
pretty
good
light
alcohol
and
light
feel
make
this
sessionable
for
sure
flavor
is
pretty
basic
but
solid
dont
have
anything
to
compare
this
to
the
closest
i
can
get
is
a
basic
porter
and
this
is
probably
as
good
as
any
of
those
ive
had
doubt
i
would
rush
out
to
get
this
again
not
that
id
be
able
to
find
it
anyway
but
a
decent
brew
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
style
at
5
0abv
its
definitely
got
the
makings
of
a
good
session
beer
overall
i
thought
this
one
was
outstanding
one
of
the
lighter
of
the
brews
for
la
and
it
still
works
very
well
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
this
on
more
then
one
occasion
and
i
ma
glad
i
bought
a
few
more
to
enjoy
a
quality
ale
here
for
sure
that
i
would
have
to
recommend
you
to
pick
up
glad
to
see
port
took
a
break
from
making
all
the
strong
beers
and
thought
about
some
light
stuff
for
once
not
that
anything
they
have
ever
done
has
been
bad
will
be
drinking
this
again
good
beer
at
a
great
price
recommended
thanks
to
seaoflament
for
another
great
trade
time
to
get
to
a
couple
from
the
first
pours
a
full
black
with
a
creamy
one
finger
tan
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
stickiness
is
very
minimal
but
some
is
there
smell
is
of
roasted
grains
smoked
barley
and
some
burnt
popcorn
there
are
weak
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
aromas
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
bitter
coffee
grinds
and
charred
grains
bitter
earthy
hops
and
scorched
marshmallows
on
the
tongue
as
well
such
a
flavorful
lager
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
somewhat
dry
and
smokey
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
and
soft
with
a
steady
carbonation
what
a
perfect
session
beer
lots
of
flavor
which
leaves
the
taste
buds
begging
for
more
i
wish
i
had
more
lower
abv
beers
like
this
in
my
fridge
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
of
this
one
are
the
strongest
points
they
call
this
one
a
session
beer
and
thats
a
great
name
for
it
interesting
brew
well
carbonated
and
thin
mouthfeel
this
wouldnt
work
for
a
stout
or
porter
but
for
a
session
lager
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
i
think
because
it
is
a
dark
beer
with
a
lot
of
the
same
flavors
associated
with
stouts
and
porters
people
forget
it
isnt
one
and
doc
the
mouthfeel
for
being
too
thin
but
that
is
why
i
like
this
one
a
true
5
abv
session
beer
that
is
full
of
flavor
with
out
the
alcohol
to
limit
me
to
one
i
could
easily
session
this
one
all
night
and
at
3
99
a
bomber
it
gets
a
good
drinkability
mark
for
me
d
kind
of
a
disappointment
from
port
at
the
end
was
not
really
enjoying
this
one
a
fair
effort
highly
recommended
22oz
bomber
bought
at
walnut
liquorette
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
opaque
black
with
an
ample
brown
head
good
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
and
flavors
mediumlight
bodied
and
very
drinkable
went
through
the
whole
bomber
before
i
knew
it
i
wish
i
had
more
bought
from
south
bay
liquor
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
dark
with
a
small
brown
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
coffee
but
in
a
soft
way
not
like
a
stout
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
chocolate
at
first
then
coffee
finishing
with
a
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
unfortunately
on
the
thin
side
not
a
complex
beer
by
any
means
but
extremely
pleasant
and
very
easy
to
drink
recommended
i
need
to
find
out
if
this
is
a
true
schwarzbier
instincts
say
no
but
at
5
this
makes
for
a
really
flavorful
session
beer
this
is
most
definitely
worth
a
try
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
probably
the
best
black
lager
ive
had
so
far
drinkability
is
moderate
this
is
a
solid
lager
from
la
with
a
good
malt
profile
big
coffeeroastsmoke
works
well
for
this
style
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
this
hints
at
the
quality
and
body
the
serpents
stout
will
bring
great
look
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
and
has
great
retention
smokey
and
sweet
malt
with
earthy
hops
and
a
light
lingering
bitterness
with
some
charred
wood
and
bittersweet
chocolate
lingering
crisp
feel
and
very
smooth
with
a
drying
finish
terrific
flavor
for
such
a
light
beer
nicely
done
and
cool
to
see
it
is
organically
made
as
there
are
not
many
options
in
the
category
o
closer
to
a
stout
than
any
black
lager
ive
had
this
also
may
be
the
best
pours
pitch
black
with
a
lingering
head
smell
is
of
wonderfully
charred
malts
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
hops
provide
just
enough
bitterness
feel
is
absolutely
velvety
smooth
light
and
very
easy
to
drink
tons
of
flavor
for
4
abv
one
of
the
best
black
lagers
currently
out
there
imo
very
good
appearance
is
a
thick
light
tan
long
lasting
head
with
lots
of
lace
and
an
almost
opaque
but
clear
black
brown
color
aroma
is
roast
up
front
then
dark
leather
meat
coffee
malt
cocoa
flavors
like
nose
dryish
at
first
then
with
the
other
qualities
including
tang
theres
a
bit
of
sweet
in
the
finish
body
is
good
tho
perhaps
a
bit
thin
very
quaffable
id
like
to
have
another
right

can
dark

roasted

scents
were
very

and
desirable
taste

very

not

a
very
mild

black
lager
easy
on
the
bite

alcohol

down

one
minor
drawback
is
a
lack
of

character
nothing
stands
out

refreshing

and
surprisingly
light
on

be
revisiting

for
a
light
beer
well
done
planning
to
enjoy
for
the
next
few
weeks
just
put
a
keg
in
the
keggerator
itll
be
gone
soon
after
my
friends
find
out
i
have
it
serving
type
can
pours
a
dark
brown
with
tan
head
has
a
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
roast
nose
with
a
light
peat
note
in
the
aroma
the
roast
or
peat
comes
through
in
the
flavor
with
a
almost
coffee
like
bitterness
the
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
remain
in
the
aftertaste
finishes
dry
almost
tart
some
light
astringency
thats
not
unpleasant
maybe
from
tartness
reminds
more
of
a
robust
porter
with
roast
character
awesome
in
my
opinion
just
my
style
this
is
a
session
beer
if
ever
there
were
one
low
in
abv
but
big
on
flavor
i
love
it
very
good
brew
overall
this
is
a
thin
and
unremarkable
black
lager
wicked
light
and
drinkable
for
a
black
beer
refreshing
in
the
cold
weather
i
got
this
in
a
variety
pack
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
beer
i
found
it
to
be
exactly
what
it
should
be
excellent
smooth
taste
o

i
am
really
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
really
delicious
and
complex
beer
for
being
only
4
abv
the
label
says
black
lager
but
if
i
was
blind
folded
i
would
call
it
a
stout
this
is
really
sessionable
i
really
enjoy
this
maybe
a
bit
to
much
buttery
malt
to
make
this
exceptional
for
me
though
it
is
not
over
barring
still
very
good
and
one
i
will
be
getting

baba
is
a
great

and
my
favorite
black
lager
overall
wow
did
uinta
ever
fit
a
ton
of
roasty
flavor
into
this
very
light
beer
unfortunately
its
body
comes
off
as
quite
watery
which
is
probably
to
be
expected
at
just
4
abv
also
i
found
the
roasty
charcoal
aspect
to
be
a
bit
much
which
negatively
affects
the
drinkability
sessionability
for
me
still
i
respect
what
uinta
has
done
with
this
it
seems
like
a
nobrainer

substantial
beer
with

abv
a
good
black
lager
o
outstanding
lager
that
has
complexities
of
a
stout
poured
on
tap
at
the
brass
tap
in
tallahassee
into
a
pint
glass
pours
jet
black
with
extremely
low
clarity
when
held
up
to
the
light
you
get
slight
reddish
brown
flecks
on
the
side
but
still
holds
an
extremely
dark
complexion
the
thick
tightly
woven
desert
sand
colored
microbubble
head
sits
firmly
on
top
of
the
beer
holding
very
firmly
for
a
number
of
minutes
it
was
about
half
an
inch
at
the
pour
and
has
deflated
down
to
a
quarter
and
still
holding
strong
as
the
beer
goes
down
it
leaves
large
sheets
of
webby
lace
this
is
an
amazing
looking
beer
aroma
consists
of
dark
chocolate
dark
roasted
coffee
sweet
fresh
bread
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
lots
going
on
here
and
all
of
it
very
pleasing
the
aroma
isnt
overpowering
but
complex
and
enjoyable
i
find
myself
smelling
it
over
and
over
looking
for
new
subtleties
taste
is
sweet
on
pallet
entry
with
a
touch
of
citrus
that
quickly
fades
directly
into
roasted
notes
next
comes
dark
chocolate
which
leads
to
a
finish
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
finally
a
touch
of
dry
roasted
flavors
and
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
all
and
all
a
good
flavor
profile
some
may
find
this
a
bit
too
bitter
or
astringent
but
this
would
be
a
delight
for
black
coffee
drinkers
and
anyone
who
drinks
ipas
would
most
likely
never
notice
its
bitterness
level
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
oomph
from
the
malt
here
but
thats
nitpicking
as
i
feel
the
drink
ability
is
higher
this
way
especially
if
consumed
by
the
liter
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
almost
perfectly
full
but
it
does
have
a
little
fizz
to
it
i
feel
this
keeps
the
beer
interesting
where
the
flavors
fall
flat
a
bit
but
i
would
prefer
a
beer
that
has
both
full
flavor
and
a
full
mouthfeel
all
and
all
a
great
beer
drinkability
is
high
and
flavor
is
complex
and
tame
at
the
same
time
i
cant
decide
if
i
want
more
out
of
it
or
less
really
but
i
will
say
its
one
of
the
best
looking
schwarzbiers
i
have
ever
seen
looking
forward
to
trying
more
options
from
these
guys
lots
of
good
stuff
coming
from
utah
it
seems
o

this
beer
is
pretty
meh
even
if
the
yeast
had
backed
off
a
bit
the
underlying
characteristics
are
uninteresting
at
least
its
fairly
easy
drinking
and
somewhat
refreshing
overall
average
to
above
average
black
lager
good
alternative
to
a
stout
or
porter
if
your
looking
to
pick
up
those
flavors
and
as
the
flavors
conclude
with
coffeetype
roast
and
a
broad
woodish
bitterness
mildly
burnt
embers
add
to
the
hops
for
a
consensus
bitter
finish
with
spice
and
pep
mediumbodied
its
refined
lagerlike
influence
complements
its
rugged
roastiness
nearly
ideally
its
an
outstanding
beer
black
lager
but
really
more
like
a
stout
in
aroma
and
body
the
lager
yeast
must
really
not
play
nice
with
the
roasted
malt
since
there
are
some
off
flavors
coming
through
the
veil
of
chocolate
and
dark
flavors
i
think
i
could
pass
this
off
to
my
stout
lovers
buddies
when
they
need
to
session
something
very
good
beer
all
the
stout
flavors
i
love
without
the
heavy
body
which
makes
it
perfect
for
a
hot
spring
night
like
tonight
dark
chocolate
and
a
little
coffee
but
not
as
much
as
a
typical
stout
which
is
balanced
with
a
bit
more
creamy
doughiness
this
is
easily
sessionable
but
has
varietal
and
diverse
flavors
to
make
it
a
special
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
in
an
underappreciated
style
not
what
i
would
typically
expect
from
a
black
lager
but
very
enjoyable
t
refreshing
mild
hops
well
balanced
with
the
malt
little
aftertaste
could
drink
several
a
wonderful
showing
for
this
style
with
allot
of
flavor
hat
finishes
out
clean
and
dry
in
the
nose
you
get
allot
of
roasted
malt
charred
vegetal
ash
and
somewhat
sweeter
munich
malt
undertones
the
roast
carries
through
to
the
palate
with
hints
of
the
ash
working
together
with
the
maltier
notes
and
finishing
with
a
pleasing
dryness
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
black
as
night
with
a
off
white
creamy
head
the
nose
was
full
of
chocolates
roasted
malts
a
little
coffee
cocoa
and
some
smoke
the
taste
followed
the
nose
well
but
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
and
smoke
while
minor
on
the
chocolate
and
coffee
not
much
by
way
of
the
hops
went
down
quite
easily
like
a
aqueous
porter
all
in
all
i
was
really
happy
with
this
beer
and
would
definitely
have
again
bottom
line
if
you
like
me
have
a
wee
bit
of
trouble
with
the
concept
of
moderation
and
are
looking
to
downgrade
your
abvs
without
sacrificing
taste
this
is
certainly
worthy
of
your
consideration
o
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
a
big
teaser
you
get
all
sorts
of
good
roast
notes
and
then
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
a
letdown
such
a
shame
o
a
great
sessions
beer
that
tastes
great
from
the
first
one
to
the
last

really
could

this

overall
a

o
great
if
not
one
of
my
favorite

really
impressive
just
how
much
flavor
they
packed
into
this
neat
little
package
great
for
a
time
you
want
that

taste
but
not
the
i
just
ate

feeling
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
get
it
again
medium

leaves
a
slight
residue
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
o
sure
to
surprise
anyone
expecting
a
mild
darkcolored
lager
because
its
so
much
like
an
easy
drinking
light
porter
at
4
highly
sessionable
as
well
and
would
be
very
good
as
such
in
cool
weather
or
as
an
accompaniment
with
a
good
steak
dinner
wasnt
so
bad
with
a
german
hot
dog
and
some
au
gratin
potatoes
either
have
yet
to
have
anything
i
did
not
like
from
uinta
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
ever
had
the
balance
and
variety
in
the
flavor
profile
are
simply
outstanding
outstanding
session
brew
pours
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
head
aroma
is
crisp
showing
itself
as
a
lager
with
a
clean
roastiness
that
gives
off
some
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
components
and
a
little
bready
flavor
lacks
the
punch
of
the
aroma
a
bit
but
definitely
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
it
sharp
roastiness
that
is
more
coffee
grind
than
chocolatey
a
touch
of
some
bread
and
a
nice
charred
and
slightly
bitter
finish
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
comes
out
big
time
as
it
warms
up
a
crisp
light
active
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
nice
sessionable
beer
here
uinta
with
a
winner
o
tasty
session
lager
one
of
3
great
black

ive
tried
this

good
price
try
some
smooth
drinking
and
i
like
the
sutle
hints
of
smokiness
that
gives
it
some
character
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
black
lagers
but
then
again
i
was
not
a
fan
of
imperial
black
ipas
this
brewery
has
won
me
over
on
both
the
head
was
a
nice
malt
color
the
pour
left
a
small
amount
of
head
but
definitely
left
lacing
on
my
16
oz
non
chilled
pint
glass
the
taste
does
not
overpower
which
is
a
big
plus
in
my
book
black
anything
tends
to
have
a
very
powerful
taste
which
removes
any
chance
for
enjoyment
this
tastes
very
smooth
goes
down
like
a
nice
chocolate
malt
the
mouth
feel
is
sooth
and
yet
has
nice
texture
reminds
me
of
the
mouth
feel
of
a
good
british
ale
it
ha
the
same
light
carbonation
too
the
flavors
are
subtle
but
present
rich
coffee
malt
maybe
a
hint
of
hazelnut
all
and
all
a
must
try
overall
pretty
solid
black
lagerschwarzbier
lots
of
character
with
that
light
feeling
love
it
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
not
my
favorite
black
lager
or
even
close
to
it
but
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
are
in
the
mood
to
try
something
new
or
into
organic
beers
this
might
be
the
one
for
you
excellent
brew
among
its
style
more
flavorful
than
regular
schwarzbier
but
still
refreshing
and
with
good
drinkability
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
nice
tan
heas
mild
lacing
lasted
a
bit
black
in
color
with
a
burnt
malt
and
coffee
aroma
taste
had
stong
coffee
noted
with
hints
of
spice
and
vanilla
medium
body
mouth
feel
with
a
dry
aftertaste
all
in
all
a
nice
beer
may
be
my
first
organic
version
the
baba
black
lager
from
uinta
is
another
solid
offering
the
beer
pours
a
nearly
opaque
dark
with
slightly
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
is
malty
and
i
get
a
touch
of
hazelnut
the
taste
is
more
of
a
roasty
maize
with
a
touch
of
peat
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
winter
session
brew
o
this
is
really
good
and
very
affordable
uinta
keeps
rolling
out
good
stuff
i
would
not
quite
call
this
offering
hearty
but
it
is
certainly
tasty
and
its
designation
as
an
organic
ale
is
a
definite
bonus
overall
a
nice
mix
of
regular
lager
tones
and
dark
malt
reminds
me
of
an
easy
going
porter
a
much
more
solid
brew
then
i
expected
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
dark
malt
flavors
with
some
sweetend
black
coffee
and
roasted
nutty
woody
essence
with
subtle
sweet
note
with
gentle
spice
in
the
finish
and
mild
fruity
toffee
tinge
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
raisin
the
overall
impression
is
this
a
great
session
lager
and
i
welcome
the
opportunity
to
have
it
anytime

overall
this
is
my
first
time
enjoying
this
style
and
i
love
it
it
is
refreshing
light
and
interesting
with
a
powerful
flavour
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
is
eminently
quaffable
i
could
enjoy
this
brew
all
day
this
was
a
very
neutral
tasting
beer
clean
an
had
plenty
of
character
it
dries
out
slowly
in
the
finish
with
a
nice
lingering
bitter
after
all
and
was
subtle
and
roasty
on
the
palate
its
all
about
the
grain
and
was
not
harsh
but
smooth
and
balanced
o
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
4
abv
makes
this
one
quite
sessionable
really
nice
flavors
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
everyday
beer
that
is
still
very
flavorful
because
the
alcohol
was
light
but
the
body
was
fully
this
had
the
feel
of
a
light
ale
like
a
vienna
lager
this
makes
me
mistake
for
styles
that
i
think
are
similar
but
really
arent
on
its
own
this
was
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
that
would
also
double
as
a
session
beer
its
not
anything
that
would
wow
anyone
but
theres
something
to
like
here
for
everyone
even
during
the
summer
months
when
dark
beers
arent
in
the
forefront
let
me
just
start
by
saying
its
the
best
black
lager
i
have
ever
drank
super
smooth
and
super
tasty
low
in
alcohol
but
high
in
taste
have
bought
multiple
six
packs
of
cans
and
its
one
of
my
favorites
i
used
to
be
a
bottle
only
guy
until
i
tried
this
beer
you
cant
beat
a
good
beer
in
a
can
definitely
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
dark
beers
whether
you
like
stouts
or
porters
this
one
is
one
to
try
definitely
a
tasty
beer
and
one
i
would
like
to
have
again
really
nice
beer
naturally
it
doesnt
say
which
is
smart
marketing
as
mysterious
sells
another
good
beer
from
uinta
im
pretty
sure
everything
they
make
is
above
average
id
try
this
again
o
overall
dark
and
roasty
fresh
but
softly
delicate
in
delivery
a
schwarz
with
some
roasty
depth
texture
and
character
o
a
pretty
good
session
beer
but
when
you
are
paying
top
dollar
from
microbreweries
it
is
hard
to
justify
buying
a
beer
that
is
lacking
a
fuller
flavor
profile
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
some
notes
of
coffee
taste
is
coffee
smokey
roasted
malts
smooth
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
o
balanced
full
flavored
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
strong
and
low
alcohol
black
lager
overall
this
is
a
great
dark
lager
it
has
the
lightness
and
freshness
of
a
lager
with
some
genuinely
welldelivered
roasted
characters
from
the
malt
its
a
delicate
balancing
act
and
its
performed
very
well
here
o
really
nothing
going
on
with
this
beer
no
unpleasant
flavors
but
also
pretty
much
no
flavor
to
this
beer
at
all
o
solid
beer
love
the
good
roasted
flavors
in
this
well
made
and
interesting
this
is
a
good
beer
very
nice
drinkable
tasty
no
harsh
edges
or
horrible
flaws
yeah
i
get
that
it
is
an
allusion
to
the
nursery
rhyme
but
how
would
any
selfrespecting
rocker
not
default
to
the
whos
baba
oreily
dunno
i
did
i
also
utilized
an
aggro
pour
which
resulted
in
a
cascadelike
action
finishing
with
a
massive
twoplus

not
quite
creamy
but
approaching
the
flavor
was
smoky
slightly
bitter
with
an
underlying
chocolatiness
finish
was
semidry
and
the
flavor
of
chocolate
lingered
well
pat
the
swallow
the
lacing
that
remained
in
the
glass
was
remarkable
good
stuff
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
a
really
enjoyable
beer
light
enough
to
session
but
flavourful
enough
to
stay
interesting
also
well
balanced
and
a
nice
appearance
i
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
from
this
brewer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
mahogany
coloring
that
is
almost
black
with
ruby
highlights
under
light
a
light
sparse
filmy
light
tan
surface
coating
of
head
aromas
of
toasted
grains
with
a
hint
of
sweet
molasses
and
some
dark
old
world
fruit
sweetness
flavors
are
sharp
initially
with
a
date
and
fig
sweetness
quickly
overridden
by
a
bitter
and
roasty
coffee
character
the
bitter
and
sweet
work
into
a
balance
with
a
touch
of
sharpness
at
the
end
of
the
palate
the
sharp
feel
is
amplified
by
the
light

0abv
a
great
match
for
burgers
or
brats
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
am
impressed
by
this
offering
more
please
othis
is
my
first
uinta
review
and
ill
say
again
that
this
beer
punches
above
its
alcohol
weight
i
think
it
is
sort
of
rare
to
find
a
good
winter
sessiontype
beer
like
this
that
being
said
the
flavor
is
a
touch
earthy
and
dull
when
compared
against
the
best
examples
of
the
style
uinta
delivers
a
great
package
in
this
black
lager
coming
in
at
just
4
abv
this
would
put
me
in
a
good
mood
while
barbecuing
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
with
its
rich
malty
base
and
nice
blend
with
the
phenolic
boozy
and
spicy
notes
throughout
the
flavor
translates
this
interplay
nicely
giving
equal
strength
to
the
malt
base
and
the
complementary
sweetness
of
the
other
included
sugars
to
this
point
no
flavoring
is
explicitly
overwhelmed
but
the
ultimate
taste
is
a
bit
basic
this
is
a
nice
standard
beer
but
again
deviates
little
from
the
stylistic
guidelines
leaving
you
with
little
to
think
about
decent
example
of
the
style
with
the
expected
slightly
smoky
aroma
and
taste
but
no
more
than
that
everything
about
it
is
kind
of
runofthemill
i
rated
a
few
qualities
higher
than
average
just
because
i
like
the
style
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
overall
well
this
one
needs
to
settle
down
a
bit
the
black
lager
is
a
popular
one
now
and
i
think
the
reason
you
do
a
black
lager
is
to
have
the
drinkability
of
the
lager
with
the
subtle
roastedness
of
a
dark
grain
this
has
it
if
you
a
patient
enough
pair
with
charcuterie
and
a
early
spring
morning
o
i
really
like
dark
beers
but
there
are
times
when
a
heavy
dark
beer
is
not
appropriate
like
after
a
hard
skiing
i
want
a
dark
beer
but
not
one
thats
heavy
this
fits
the
bill
perfectly
a
good
tasting
lightbodied
dark
lager
the
body
is
almost
featherweight
but
i
suppose
that
goes
with
the
lager
style
if
a
porter
or
stout
seems
like
too
much
at
the
time
but
you
want
a
dark
beer
flavor
this
one
is
a
good
choice
o
another
one
of
these
domestic
dark
german
lagers
that
goes
a
bit
overboard
with
the
hops
let
this
one
expire
and
then
give
it
a
shot
d
this
one
isnt
balanced
enough
for
me
too
grainy
with
not
enough
chocolatey
sweetness
but
its
very
drinkable
and
not
offensive
in
any
way
black
with
a
nice
light
tan
quilt
smells
malty
some
coffee
some
soil
some
leather
all
components
come
together
nicely
i
like
the
nose
robust
flavor
with
leather
cocoa
dark
chocolates
coffee
espresso
tradiitional
a
slight
earthy
character
well
fucking
done
medium
on
full
bodied
with
moderate
but
prickly
carb
this
is
a
sincerely
well
done
beer
absolute
delight
for
the
style
really
recommend
this
the
aftertaste
is
weak
as
well
but
nice
and
creamy
this
is
the
third
beer
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
and
none
of
them
were
very
impressive
a
decent
black
lager
though
the
taste
was
heavy
on
the
burnt
wood
overall
i
like
baba
black
lager
and
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
its
the
sort
of
beer
that
lends
itself
to
drinking
and
not
so
much
reviewing
heavyhitting
roasted
chocolate
flavors
present
sweet
mellow
flavors
meld
with
a
dry
cracker
finish
cereal
grains
on
the
back
end
this
little
beer
packs
on
the
flavor
this
is
organic
too
nice
a
nice
little
beer
here
this
is
a
style
that
is
underrated
in
my
mind
and
one
i
need
to
revisit
more
and
more
cool
label
art
to
boot
a
very
sessionable
brew
perfect
for
the
winter
and
is
a
great
substitute
if
you
love
porters
organic
and
all
if
you
are
into
that
and
all
around
great
beer
overall
a
nice
dark
lager
really
easy
drinking
one
of
the
better
session
ales
ive
had
i
could
recommend
this
to
anyone
d
quaffable
and
rather
enjoyable
it
depends
how
youre
viewing
this
beer
if
you
look
at
it
compared
to
all
of
beerdom
its
a
fairly
pedestrian
average
at
best
offering
if
you
look
at
it
solely
as
a
session
brew
its
a
very
nice
offering
from
uinta
lots
of
flavor
and
pretty
decent
character
for
a
4
abv
offering
especially
for
one
of
such
dark
coloring
im
quite
happy
with
and
would
seriously
consider
pickup
a
sixer
when
im
looking
for
an
enjoyable
session
beer
overall
very
easy
drinking
great
tasting
brew
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
from
such
a
low
strength
brew
great
session
beer
and
would
seem
to
go
great
with
a
meat
pizza
or
a
nicely
charred
black
n
blue
burger
as
for
a
schwarzbier
it
strikes
me
as
a
bit
nontraditional
but
seems
to
capture
enough
of
the
categorical
essence
and
it
is
baba
black
sheep
so
i
guess
that
name
fits
if
you
like
light
beers
this
is
a
good
one
with
more
flavor
than
most
black
on
color
with
a
reddishbrown
hue
when
held
up
to
a
bright
light
poured
with
a
huge
bubbly
beige
foam
that
drapes
the
glass
with
sticky
lacings
earthy
dark
roasted
and
burnt
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
in
the
background
medium
bodied
and
smooth
through
the
middle
despite
the
lively
aggressive
carbonation
up
front
bitter
burnt
malt
flavor
up
front
that
that
tapers
through
the
middle
to
dark
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
to
the
end
finishes
with
a
slightly
bitter
dark
roasted
malt
aftertaste
overall
very
refreshing
for
such
a
dark
roasty
beer
not
much
malt
character
i
poured
this
weak
brew
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
black
as
specified
and
poured
a
very
chocolaty
head
the
beer
also
had
good
lacing
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
a
hit
but
like
with
other
organic
brews
it
was
not
the
beer
was
pretty
tasteless
and
watery
it
had
a
weak
smokey
character
but
without
any
ass
end
it
just
could
not
make
the
cut
i
will
not
buy
again
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slick
with
very
light
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
chewy
feel
that
runs
off
bitter
overall
a
very
tasty
black
lager
that
id
definitely
recommend
roasted
barley
and
coffee
notes
up
front
slight
cardboard
flavor
as
well
singed
caramel
and
more
roasted
malts
fill
up
the
palate
tobacco
and
earthy
peaty
notes

the
finish
roasted
coffee
bitterness
in
the
end
with

far
is
much
more
of
a
porter
than
a
black
lager
i
think
the
flavor
is
very
robust
burnt
malt
dominates
the
mouth
while
some
bitterness
rises
u
in
the
finish
more
from
the
darkness
of
the
malt
then
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
pretty
heavy
again
for
a
lager
lots
of
body
in
this
one
and
good
carbonation
a
nice
bitter
roasted
flavor
is
left
in
the
mouth
for
awhile
which
is
nice
this
time
of
year
overall
a
good
fall
session
beer
super
low
abv
makes
it
an
all
day
beer
deep
black
in
color
with
a
nice
sized
coffee
colored
head
on
top
very
nice
roasted
and
grainy
aroma
trace
of
malty
sweetness
mellow
roasted
and
dark
grain
flavors
touch
of
burnt
caramel
going
on
quick
hop
bite
at
the
end
nice
mouthfeelhigher
level
of
co2
gives
it
a
slight
zing
on
the
tongue
a
lot
of
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
again
i
find
myself
appreciating
this
beer
more
as
it
warms
nice
malty
roasted
tone
to
it
but
not
so
heavy
or
thorough
that
its
out
of
the
style
range
fairly
easy
to
drink
oddly
more
easy
to
drink
than
the
lager
i
had
just
a
bit
earlier
than
this
poured
black
with
a
relatively
thin
tan
head
and
good
lacing
smell
is
chocolatey
and
earthy
taste
is
malt
focused
with
roasted
coffeechocolate
notes
which
are
pretty
damn
tasty
i
feel
like
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
porters
or
even
brown
ales
that
focus
on
the
roasted
notes
the
fact
that
this
is
a
lager
comes
out
most
dominantly
by
the
thinner
mouthfeel
which
makes
for
a
much
more
drinkable
brew
so
i
can
dig
it
not
bad
a
decent
clean
black
lager
overall
one
of
the
better
black
lagers
i
had
in
fact
i
believe
this
beer
might
have
the
most
flavor
i
seen
in
a
black
lager
with
an
equally
lower
abv
perfect
for
session
ability
recommended
good
beers
have
arrived
drink
it
tonight
drink
it
pour
it
enjoy
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
schwarzbier
as
it
was
nicely
flavored
balanced
and
mostly
importantly
drinkable
i
ripped
through
this
glass
a
lot
faster
than
i
expected
this
was
another
solid
beer
from
these
guys
oits
definitely
an
okay
beer
its
easy
drinking
and
tastes
fine
though
i
wish
it
tasted
more
how
it
smelled
the
flavors
were
a
bit
of
a
letdown
itll
be
easy
to
finish
though
i
dont
see
a
need
to
get
it
again
ever
its
forgettable
o
an
exceptional
black
larger
in
my
opinion
well
balanced
wiith
nice
roasted
malts
and
very
little
hop
presence
would
certainly
putrchase
this
again
o
solid
overall
pretty
enjoyable
i
cannot
be
sure
if
i
like
this
beer
or
not
i
certainly
wasnt
expecting
a
tartness
to
the
roasted
malts
but
that
sure
makes
it
unique
since
it
wasnt
a
boring
tasteless
lager
i
have
to
say
its
worth
a
try
o
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
but
thats
not
saying
much
the
style
is
just
isnt
that
great
to
my
palate
this
was
like
steinlager
pure
with
cocoa
added
the
high
point
of
the
brew
would
be
the
presentation
its
better
than
domestic
beer
but
doesnt
stand
out
among
the
craft
i
dont
recommend
and
wouldnt
buy
overall
pretty
decent
considering
the
beer
the
scent
is
great
but
the
taste
seems
much
weaker
definitely
dig
the
lightsessionable
dark
lagers
but
there
are
others
id
prefer
overall
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
it
could
go
well
with
heavier
foods
it
is
a
little
watery
but
the
overall
flavors
were
ok
i
was
surprised
because
utah
has
its
strange
4
abv
laws
so
i
was
not
expecting
this
beer
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
buy
this
brew
and
eat
a
reubon
i
love
that
this
one
isnt
dry
but
it
is
definitely
a
heavy
beer
would
go
great
with
certain
foods
i
imagine
o
a
pretty
good
black
lager
crisp
and
roast
easy
drinking
good
but
not
overly
flavorful
o
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
o
not
a
bad
brew
from
uinta
and
this
is
from
first
and
i
have
heard
all
good
things
and
this
confirms
it
an
abover
average
beer
strong
smoky
aroma
has
tones
of
licorice
and
charred
wood
it
pours
a
deep
sable
a
whisker
above
black
with
a
decent
tan
head
flavor
is
woody
and
smoky
with
hints
of
licorice
and
coffee
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
but
body
is
average
overall
its
soso
but
worth
sampling
an
enjoyable
dark
lager
easy
drinking
but
without
becoming
boring
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
but
could
definitely
use
some
refinement
poured
into
nonic
pint

finger

there
are
some
ruby
highlights
at

of
the
glass
the
smell
features
roasty
chocolate
notes
along
with
noticeable
lager
yeast
character
there
are
subtle
hints
of
smoke

the
taste
has
a
much
heavier
presence
of
smoke
almost
a
campfire
like
woodiness
bitter
waves
of
roast
come
through
minimal

presence
noted
this
beer
feel
very
light
with
somewhat
high
carbonation
there
is
certainly
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
this
small
beer
with
smoke
being
the
main
note
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
it
is
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
works
for
me
medium
body
with
a
lively
fine
carbonation
d
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
i
would
get
this

islands
of
larger

dissipate

very
good
and
the

shows
above
average
stickiness
while
pure

not
fully
opaque
the
liquid
has
great
clarity
despite
the
hue

is
some
country

this
a
fine
black
lager

i
just
dont
generally
find
the

aspects
of

to
work
that
well

darker
malts
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
received
in
a
beer
of
the
month
mix
six
pack
from
vintage
cellar
in
blacksburg
virginia
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
the
name
does
not
lie
pours
a
nice
black
with
a
nice
one
finger
brownish
white
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
definitely
a
little
hint
of
coffee
tastes
of
a
heavily
roasted
malt
with
little
hop
presence
but
enough
to
balance
it
the
malt
has
a
bit
of
a
coffee
taste
this
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
in
between
and
carbonation
seems
correct
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
very
good
black
lager
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
the
others
in
this
style
that
ive
tried
have
been
imports
and
had
that
traditional
euro
yeasty
mildew
funk
to
them
this
didnt
it
was
mellow
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
didnt
mind
it
but
there
isnt
really
anything
here
that
will
keep
me
coming
back
a
nice
offering
from
uinta
very
drinkable
although
its
labeled
as
a
black
lager
it
really
brings
porter
to
mind
its
low
4
0
abv
makes
it
a
good
candidate
for
a
dark
session
brew
o
a
damn
fine
brew
o
for
4
its
got
a
considerable
flavour
very
drinkable
a
well
made
beer
uinta
keeps
coming
out
with
good
stuff
its
a
worthy
competitor
to
session
dark
though
it
does
lean
a
little
more
euro
its
a
slightly
sweet
lager
with
an
earthy
caramel
and
mildly
roasted
barley
character
its
quite
nice
the
body
is
light
but
not
thin
this
all
makes
for
a
pleasant
drinkable
session
beer
worth
a
try
overall
a
nice
flavorful
lager
just
right
for
mass
consumption
or
a
tasty
lawnmower
beer
o
the
crisp
clean
lagered
beer
has
full
fresh
dark
malt
and
a
nice
support
of
hops
very
drinkable
and
tasty

flavors

balanced
and
laid

better
than
expected
actually
overall
not
a
bad
beergood
in
fact
just
a
little
downside
overall
my
first
black
lagerschwarzbier
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
but
it
seems
true
to
the
style
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
and
im
not
big
on
lagers
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
similar
beers
to
try
and
ill
definitely
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
one
if
i
find
it
again
dthis
one
is
really
not
my
thing
and
im
about
to
drainpour
it
did
not
enjoy
this
one
after
i
got
past
the
nose
notes
the
smokiness
and
the
dryness
makes
this
one
a
solid
beer
and
a
little
bit
hearty
cheers
overall
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
excite
me
and
probably
not
a
style
i
have
that
often
but
its
a
pretty
solid
brew
just
not
for
me
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
roasty
schwarzbier
type
flavor
profile
but
this
leans
more
towards
a
nut
brown
it
actually
drinks
pretty
well
and
i
could
see
myself
downing
a
few
of
these
in
a
social
setting
its
tasty
but
you
dont
have
to
think
about
it
o
probably
wouldnt
pick
up
again
the
negatives
are
too
strong
over
the
positives
overall
a
wonderfully
crafted
beer
that
smells
awful
and
doesnt
taste
like
much
in
no
rush
to
try
this
again
solid
black
lager
that
drinks
smoothly
and
has
a
pretty
nice
mix
of
flavors
overall
pretty
nice
very
drinkable
soft
brown
malts
light
cocoa
and
vanilla
even
caramel
light
bitterness
and
hops
juicy
lager
very
much
like
a
brown
ale
but
lagered
very
similar
to
a
thin
porter
good
bittering
hop
presence
and
the
malt
is
also
bitter
surprisingly
short
aftertaste
thin
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
o
the
flavors
up
front
are
very
nice
the
flavors
that
linger
arent
as
nice
but
they
dont
ruin
the
beer
just
a
slight
bitter
tang
that
seems
out
of
place
overall
i
approve
a
good
sessionable
alternative
to
many
dark
beers
which
i
cant
handle
too
many
of
in
a
night
fits

brewing
of

enjoyed
that
a

also
full

black

a

to
my
1011
dollar
six
pack
this
beer
is
a
dark
brown
colored
liquid
with
a
slightly
read

moderate

the
aroma
is
malty
with
a
notable

quality
the

through

which
has
a

astringency
its
a

beer
with
some
sweetness
and
a
background
of
underripe
fruit
the
smoky
aroma
is
the
most
intriguing
thing
about
this
brew
all
in
all
this
one
is
just
okay
austere
without
being
very
hoppy
dry
with
a

more
than

cute

the
taste
is

not
great
not

definitely
not

it

really
not
a

taste
is
roasted

sweet

similar
to
an
american
black
ale
the
body
is
too
light
compared
to
what
i
am
used
to
for
either
style
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
falls
just
below
average
for
the
scope
of
what
i
have
had
in
the
style
nothing
i
would
skip
getting
a
variety
pack
for
but
nothing
to
rush
out
for
either
a
beer

decent

not

at
all
but
i
would
go
to
guinness
before
this
overall
very
good
for
the
style

nose
holds
many
of
the
the
qualities
of
a
bock
beer
with
a
smoky
caramel
malt
grain
barley
and
carbonative
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
toffee
maltiness
barley
grain
and
light
chocolate
malt
it
just
tastes
cheap
and
detracts
from
the
overall
experience
pours
a
cola
color
dark

a
slight

malty
but
has
less
complexity
on

than
on

that
caramel
is
soft

stronger
in
the

than
on

with
a
small

bitter

nothing
full
blown
tiny
bit
of
char
to
come
forward
at

this

has
the
right

and
holds

touch
to

very
easy

great
smooth

bitter

underrated
and
just
rare
enough
to
catch
my
eye
at
the
pub
o
just
as
i
remember
it
good
flavor
good
representation
of
a
schwarzbier
but
nothing
spectacular
id
get
this
in
a
pinch
if
needed
but
wouldnt
search
it
out
in
the
future
tastes
like
a
slightly
stronger
variant
of
a
shiner
bock
i
like
beer
and
this
is
beer
meh
ive
had
worse
skip
it
overall
a
solid
if
not
spectacular
beer
this
could
be
an
interesting
alternative
to
traditional
lagers
refreshing
but
more
substantial
than
what
many
may
be
used
to
in
the
style
good
beer
and
great
price
overall
nice
schwarzbier
i
could

this
one
again
this

easy

again
much
better
poured
than
in
a
bottle
this
may
not
be
the
finest
schwarzbier
out
there
im
sure
as
this
is
my
first
but
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
ill
drink
this
again
in
the
future
not
a
fave
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
decent
taste
just
not
what
i
want
in
a
black
lager
overall
an
average
schwarzbier
i
really
love
spoetzl
brewing
but
this
one
didnt
drive
me
crazy
not
recommended
you
can
get
much
better
examples
elsewhere
id
rather
have
a
guiness
overall
its
been
a
while
since
i
last
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
still
is
as
enjoyable
as
i
remember
this
is
a
great
beer
when
you
want
a
dark
beer
with
roasted
notes
without
being
too
heavy
this
is
also
a
great
alternative
to
those
not
wanting
a
nitro
guinness
since
it
offers
a
similar
dryness
as
long
as
you
dont
go
in
expecting
a
fullbodied
porter
or
stout
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
would
love
to
pair
with
some
oysters
or
smoked
cheese
overall
a
bit
too
malty
sweet
to
be
very
refreshing
but
still
easy
to
drink
a
few
overall
average
ok
for
casual
drinking
but
it
does
not
have
anything
that
stands
out
o
enjoyable
but
its
a
little
too
heavy
for
me
to
want
another
one
but
it
wasnt
heavy
enough
to
be
noteworthy
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
faint
ruby
highlights
at
the
edges
and
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
nothing
aromas
of
caramel
and
burnt
sugars
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
faint
earthy
hop
to
counter
the
flavor
is
malty
sweet
with
lots
of
darker
sugars
and
melanoids
and
just
a
hint
of
earth
chocolate
and
light
fruit
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
decent
dark
lager
probably
my
favorite
from
the
mix
o
nice
and
refreshing
with
a
little
bit
of
roast
not
a
fan
of
the
long
sweetness
at
the
end
primary
downside
i
think
id
say
this
is
more
like
an
english
mild
ale
a
very
quaffable
brew
with
a
surprisingly
complex
flavor
that
leaves
a
good
feeling
in
the
tummy
purchased
as
part
of
a
variety
pack
for
about
8
50
im
really
getting
into
this
variety
pack
from
a
brewery
whose
products
just
arrived
in
my
town
overall
3
75
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
especially
in
the
price
bracket
that
this
brand
falls
into
this
is
a
very
good
substitute
for
some
of
the
more
expensive
beers
of
this
style
picked
up
a
mixed
shiner
six
to
try
the
brewery
this
one
has
a
similar
appearance
to
the
others
i
have
tried
so
far
they
seem
to
all
look
the
same
except
color
same
with
smell
not
a
lot
going
on
there
but
the
taste
is
pretty
good
on
this
one
nice
roasted
flavor
and
pretty
smooth
with
no
aftertaste
overall
i
am
finding
the
shiner
beers
to
be
decent
and
this
one
i
would
certainly
drink
again
although
i
also
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
by
any
stretch
i
actually
got
this
black
lager
from
a
friend
who
didnt
like
it
but
hes
a
bud
drinker
so
i
knew
that
didnt
mean
anything
i
think
its
pretty
good
the
color
is
dark
not
opaque
there
is
an
almost
deep
garnet
color
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
there
isnt
much
going
on
in
the
nose
at
all
maybe
some
faint
spices
but
im
going
out
on
a
limb
for
that
one
the
taste
is
nutty
not
too
bitter
with
a
surprisingly
smooth
finish
dark
opaque
brew
with
a
yellowish
head
that
dissipates
quickly
minimal
head
retention
or
lacing
slightly
sour
aroma
smoky
taste
that
is
smooth
but
didnt
make
much
of
an
impression
the
taste
is
not
something
that
would
have
me
recommending
this
beer
although
i
would
drink
it
in
the
future
if
someone
gave
me
one
pleasant
mouth
feel
creamy
overall
goes
down
pretty
easy
good
toasted
and
roasted
malt
flavors
taste
is
light
crisp
dry
hint
of
licorice
and
molasses
prune
coffee
but
a
bit
thin
and
light
with
faint
sweetness
and
bitterness
dry
finish
with
hint
of
coffee
bitterness
it
has
enough
character
to
keep
it
reasoanbly
enjoyable
for
a
bit
but
it
is
not
memorable
at
all
and
can
get
tiresome
fairly
easily
overall
good
lager
i
would
have
this
one
again
not
as
dark
and
roasty
and
complex
as
the
more
authentic
beers
in
this
style
but
a
plenty
sessionable
dark
lager
that
is
still
at
least
a
step
better
than
say
the
chive
beer
that
just
came
out
more
red
than
black
in
color
especially
in
the
light
with
a
short
lived
inch
of
tan
foam
nose
is
lager
yeast
and
sweeter
amber
malts
i
dont
get
much
bitter
roasted
barley
on
this
at
all
there
is
a
little
more
in
the
flavor
but
this
is
still
an
extremely
light
beer
for
a
dark
lager
that
and
the
low
abv
make
it
drinkable
enough
but
it
finishes
a
bit
sweet
and
a
bit
metallic
a
real
tun
off
passable
but
not
special
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
metallic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
char
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
metallic
aroma
i
am
getting
is
not
too
pleasant
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
schwarzbier
with
an
ample
dose
of
chocolate
malts
works
well
at
the
price

o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
but
seems
to
be
too
thin
and
a
bit
watery
its
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
are
looking
for
something
you
can
drink
a

of
but
has

roasty

it

could
be

needs
a

more
balance
as
burnt

steal
the

unremarkable
c
o
this
beer
gave
me

not
enough
where
i
cant
share
it
with

who
are
not
into
the
robust

of
craft
beers
is
it
the
best

of
a
black
lager
no
is
it
a
nice
change
and
a
better
choice
than
a
bmc
hell
yes
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
even
though
it
lacked
the
flavors
that
are
found
in
better
beers
it

would
have
again
serving

overall
again
a
very

definitely
an
upgrade
from

good

out
of
the
mixed
6pack
from

take
note
this
is
probably
the
only
one
id
buy
a
6pack
of
in
the
future
im
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
beer
again
as
i
work
through
the
case
and
i
will
certainly
buy
it
again
someday

black

pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
thick

the
aroma
is
a

and
a

is
mild

malty
and
kind
of
a
one

type

being
that
there
doesnt

pleasant
enough
but
there
are
better

out
there
dark

some

some

and
thats
about
it
on
the
thin

nothing
special
going
on
here
as
seems
to
be
the
case
with
all
the
shiner
brews
almost
craft
beer
one
and
done
having
reviewed
the
other
5
varieties
that
came
in
the
shiner
variety
pack
i
bought
last
year
and
coming
up
with
several
scores
in
the
low
3s
i
wasnt
expecting
much
turns
out
i
saved
the
best
for
last
as
this
beer
turns
out
to
a
gorgeous
solidly
tasting
brew
it
is
by
no
means
complex
but
the
chocolate
notes
and
hops
are
dolled
out
in
the
right
proportions
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
creamy
i
dont
know
if
the
year
of
cellering
helped
but
i
would
gladly
buy
a
six
of
this
to
find
out
the
beer
doesnt
taste
bad
but
really
not
much
of
a
schwarzbier
an
introduction
to
what
roasted
malt
tastes
like
malty
brown
bread
roasted
caramel
sweetness
some
coffee
hop
bitterness
is
mild
finish
is
crisp
and
semidry
body
is
lightmedium
silky
crisp
overall
not
worth
your
time
or
money
you
could
do
much
better
for
the
same
style
beer
at
the
same
price
this
is
at
least
drinkable
though
o
a
good
and
very
drinkable
black
lager
not
too
complex
but
decent
watery
too
sugary
and
not
enough
bite
from
hops
and
roast
both
but
hey
its
shiner
so
this
is
made
for
easy
sunshine
drinking
a
great
gateway
lager
o
not
a
munich
dunkel
by
any
means
but
a
smooth
beer
with
roasted
character
this
is
a
great
textbook
of
style
in
the
schwarzbier
category
whether
german
or
bohemian
big
flavor
at
4

spoetzl
surprises
yet
again
ok
im
sorry
but
this
is
be
best
black
lager
i
have
ever
drank
in
the
u
s
i
have
been
to
21
countries
and
have
tasted
a
lot
of
beer
but
without
a
doubt
this
beer
is
smooth
and
satisfying
it
taste
just
like
a
few
beers
in
ireland
i
had
i
live
in
madison
alabama
and
we
can
not
buy
it
around
here
i
have
to
drive
north
for
about
two
hours
to
get
it
and
its
worth
the
trip
i
wish
i
could
find
it
closer
i
guess
why
i
like
it
do
much
is
because
it
reminds
me
of
a
true
taste
outside
the
u
s
o
decent
for
a
shiner
product
but
ive
definitely
had
better
schwarzbiers
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
toasted
and
light
bready
malt
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
is
attenuated
toasted
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
and
grassy
hops
light
bodied
i
got
hopeful
as
i
poured
this
because
it
looks
pretty
good
but
this
is
really
light
flavored
almost
tastes
watered
down
too
bad
because
the
basic
components
seem
nice
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
beige
colored
head
the
aroma
has
some
sweet
malts
to
it
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
simple
and
perhaps
weaker
than
expected
there
is
a
taste
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
but
it
is
weak
overall
this
is
a
very
sweet
easy
drinking
taste
that
is
smooth
refreshing
could
use
a
little
more
boldness
but
thats
just
me
objective
as
i
can
get
i
drink
lighter
lager
for
fun
but
dark
is
a
treat
if
its
as
low
as
4
99
go
for
it
if
5
99
or
more
no
one
of
my
favs
as
far
as
the
shiner
lineup
is
concerned
ive
only
had
two
schwarzbier
and
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
two
this
is
a
very
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
got
as
part
of
the
family
pack
i
need
to
find
a
store
that
sells
it
in
its
own
packaging
because
i
want
more
o
was
better
then
i
thought
it
would
be
would
buy
again
if
i
saw
a
six
pack
by
itself
and
not
part
of
the
shiner
family
reunion
variety
pack
didnt
care
for
half
the
beers
in
there
poured
black
with
little
head
mild
aroma
flavor
is
all
upfront
with
some
black
patent
malt
flavor
that
eased
in
the
middle
to
no
aftertaste
on
the
end
mildly
interesting
for
a
near
craft
beer
inoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
not
sure
i
would
want
more
then
one
but
would
be
a
good
choice
if
only
bmc
was
available
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
while
spoetzl
hasnt
produced
any
world
class
beers
that
ive
tried
their
beers
arent
bad
and
arent
too
expensive
plus
its
locally
produced
here
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
very
little
body
was
expecting
more
overall
i
tried
this
again
because
i
loved
it
when
i
first
got
into
craft
i
dont
anymore
its
ok
dont
get
me
wrong
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
if
it
were
the
only
thing
available
but
now
as
a
fan
of
bigger
beers
this
just
doesnt
cut
it
anymore
everything
is
just
too
light
on
a
more
positive
note
i
still
think
its
one
of
the
best
looking
bottles
in
the
business
this
just
seems
to
be
barely
more
interesting
than
any
flabby
lager
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
pinkies
in
san
angelo
overall
drinkability
ive
only
had
a
few
schwarzbiers
but
i
definitely
like
them
this
one
is
no
exception
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
beautiful
black
color
poured
out
of
a
very
bottle
perfect
for
the
beer
drinker
who
wants
to
endugle
in
a
black
lager
with
a
nice
amount
of
malt
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
a
little
thin
and
the
aroma
could
be
a
bit
richer
this
is
a
style
i
really
like
though
im
not
a
big
lager
drinker
sadly
the
execution
here
is
less
than
stellar
mediumlight
body
light
carbonation
nothing
special
here
overall
like
most
shiners
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
and
makes
a
decent
session
but
it
is
really
nothing
to
pine
for

this
is
a
black
lager
with
a
good
taste
that
ends
pretty
abruptly
this
is
a
nice
enough
to
enjoy
lager
with
nice
black
notes
mouthfeel
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
compared
to
the
rest
of
most
black
lagers
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
overall
an
easy
drinking
black
lager
but
not
overly
exciting
quenches
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
mediumlight
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
and
a
clean
overall
feel
drinks
light
and
easy
not
exactly
a
super
refresher
but
remains
pretty
quaffable
one
of
the
better
bottles
in
the
shiner
family
reunion
mixed
six
another
session
beer
with
flavor
more
of
a
simple
toasted
beer
than
a
roastedtoasted
complex
beer
its
one
of
shiners
only
decent
beers
but
a
black
lager
from
almost
anywhere
else
will
probably
be
just
as
good
or
better
overall
drinkable
but
too
carbonated
flavor
is
simple
and
not
at
all
memorable
too
bland
for
my
tastes
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
red
tinges
nice
malt
smell
with
toffee
undertones
maltysweet
taste
with
a
greasy
finish
very
light
hoppiness
that
you
have
to
be
looking
for
to
find
overall
a
nice
lager
from
shiner
no
boozy
taste
but
a
nice
buzz
d
a
very
approachable
quite
toasty
dark
beer
an
excellent
option
at
a
price
point
hardly
above
macro
swill
overall
a
decent
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
this
brewer
although
thats
faint
praise
improves
with
some
warming
o
this
is
decent
enough
probably
one
of
my
preferred
shiner
offerings
far
from
anything
special
however
it
is
very
drinkable
with
a
quick
finish
in
many
ways
i
find
the
shiner
lineup
to
be
the
same
all
ive
tried
are
light
drinkable
and
quick
finishing
great
for
warm
texas
weather
so
disregard
the
numbers
i
assign
because
it
is
all
about
reference
points
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
theres
a
faint
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
not
much
else
its
not
very
strong
theres
good
flavor
from
the
roasted
malts
and
theres
a
taste
of
coffee
there
is
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
carbonation
makes
this
beer
light
on
the
mouthfeel
overall
i
feel
this
beer
is
definitely
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
beer
honestly
i
must
admit
i
did
not
expect
much
from
this
beer
as
cheap
darker
beers
are
usually
unworthy
but
this
brew
poured
a
toasted
amber
color
with
the
right
amount
of
frothy
head
and
lace
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
aged
oak
and
an
earthy
malt
scent
the
flavor
was
smooth
with
a
slight
tinge
to
the
palette
a
worthy
beer
indeed
poured
this
schwarzbier
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
brownish
black
color
produced
a
creamy
thick
tannish
head
left
an
ample
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
barely
rather
weak
the
beer
was
light
in
body
a
base
of
toasted
malt
and
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
overall
disappointed
thin
watery
and
not
much
character
on
to
the
next
prost
o
its
ok
the
smoke
is
ok
but
i
would
imagine
it
would
become
tiresome
after
about
3
bottles
o
this
is
one
of
the
few
from
shiner
that
actually
has
a
very
decent
taste
it
has
great
flavors
but
the
mouthfeel
is
just
terrible
and
almost
ruins
the
beer
for
me
i
just
dont
get
how
its
so
hard
for
them
to
make
a
beer
that
goes
down
easy
o
i
really
like
it
it
is
a
bit
undercarbonated
for
a
black
lager
it
tastes
a
bit
like
a
watereddown
stout
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
its
delicious
and
i
like
it
better
than
most
a
solid
b
overall
looks
and
smells
weak
but
taste
matters
most
and
this
beer
tastes
pretty
darn
good
for
a
lager
overall
this
is
an
ok
brew
from
shiner
but
is
pretty
lackluster
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
ill
be
avoiding
this
one
in
the
future
i
might
as
well
have
had
a
glass
of
coffee
carafe
rinsewater
for
the
same
effect
overall
grade
d
this
beer
is
pretty
straight
forward
a
mild
bittersweetness
upfront
and
a
roasted
smokey
finish
its
definitely
not
the
best
black
lager
or
beer
that
spoetzl
makes
but
its
not
bad
pours
out
like
a
cola
dark
some
what
see
thru
body
with
a
big
bubbly
head
that
settles
real
quick
leaves
some
lacing
smell
consists
of
grains
and
a
slight
roasted
scent
taste
is
a
little
more
exciting
roasted
malts
come
thru
leaving
a
weak
coffee
flavor
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
real
thin
and
watery
lots
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
attempt
at
the
style
but
could
use
bolder
flavors
to
grab
your
attention
unimpressive
from
my
brother
duane
thanks
buddy
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
like
the
idea
of
an
older
nonab
brewery
in
shiner
texas
but
i
was
disappointed
the
beer
does
not
have
a
good
aroma
a
little
like
maraschino
cherries
perhaps
there
was
a
very
small
head
with
no
retention
of
lacing
at
all
the
taste
had
a
burnt
tone
but
primarily
it
tasted
like
cardboard
texture
was
very
watery
with
almost
no
carbonation
it
was
not
pleasant
cold
or
warm
it
was
not
good
perhaps
it
was
old
overall
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
taste
hints
at
the
right
notes
but
the
smell
on
this
is
not
quite
jiving
with
me
there
is
much
better
schwarzbier
out
there
for
sure
than
this
overall
a
conflicting
experiencethe
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
but
leaves
an
unimpressive
profile
presents
well
but
can
best
be
filed
under
mediocre
12

medium

toasted

some

this
is
a
nice
brew
for
shiner
o
i
was
hoping
for
more
dark
notes
and
some
complexity
but
really
it
is
mostly
just
a
fizzy
dark
beer
which
isnt
the
worse
but
doesnt
have
much
to
recommend
it
notes
shiner
continues
to
impress
me
when
dealing
with
their
catalog
outside
of
the
flagship
bock
i
let
this
warm
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
before
trying
poured
with
an
average
sized
tan
head
that
quickly
subsided
to
a
few
islands
a

and

with
some

the

so

initial

overall
shiner
produces
something
slightly
different
a
bohemian
take
on
a
dark
beer
seems
to
be
an
appropriate
label
for
this
beer
its
worth
a
try
but
im
not
sure
its
worth
another
with
other
so
many
other
great
schwarzbiers
available
i
was
really
surprised
at
how
good
this
beer
was
i
figured
id
come
a
long
way
in
my
taste
for
beer
since
the
early
days
of
drinking
this
stuff
all
the
time
but
this
is
really
a
damn
good
beer
for
the
money
the
sweet
dried
fruit
flavours
are
perfectly
balanced
by
the
bitter
roasted
malt
character
and
just
enough
hops
the
light
body
is
a
nice
touch
too
im
not
sure
what
i
think
about
the
level
of
carbonation
seems
like
it
might
be
a
bit
high
but
it
doesnt
really
bother
me
this
is
an
excellent
brew
that
i
will
be
sure
to
buy
again
i
guess
my
first
instincts
as
a
beer
drinker
were
right
this
really
is
one
of
the
best
beers
in
its
price
range
overall
seems
to
make
the
sam
adams
mistake
of
dumbingdown
a
style
so
that
everybody
likes
it
have
some
balls
i
want
to
taste
some
complexity
in
my
schwarzbiers
not
just
a
pilsbrown
dye
personally
id
prefer
a
little
more
dryness
in
the
finish
and
maybe
tone
down
the
sweetness
a
bit
but
overall
a
very
nice
schwarzbier
this
beer
was
givent
to
me
by
a
coworker
who
did
a
trade
with
someone
from
texas
i
poured
it
out
into
a
sam
adams
pint
glass
the
color
was
very
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
color
head
on
top
the
head
had
a
good
retentions
which
was
impressive
to
me
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
of
a
pretty
typical
roasted
aroma
with
some
lager
yeast
aromas
the
taste
is
a
little
chocolaty
and
with
the
lager
bitterness
in
the
aftettaste
the
flavors
are
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
little
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamy
no
bite
to
this
one
at
all
overall
i
found
it
to
be
a
pretty
nice
black
lager
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
schwarbier
but
it
definitely
is
not
the
best
if
i
were
to
want
to
drink
more
of
this
style
i
would
choose
another
brand
onight
the
greatest
beer
but
very
drinkable
the
fairly
low
abv
allows
the
enjoyment
of
several
of
these
its
not
the
best
but
its
certainly
better
than
a
bud
light
o
this
is
actually
my
second
time
tasting
this
beer
the
first
time
was
in
the
midst
of
an
all
afternooneveningnight
session
and
it
did
not
agree
with
me
at
all
i
was
actually
apprehensive
to
give
the
second
bottle
a
try
but
im
pleased
that
i
did
i
enjoy
the
darker
flavors
combined
with
the
lighter
mouthfeel
an
easy
way
to
get
the
complex
qualities
without
the
heaviness
that
i
find
in
some
bigger
beers
that
i
enjoy
o
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
this
isnt
going
to
shatter
any
ones
world
but
it
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
overall
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
to
drink
a
beer
that
is
lighter
on
the
palate
but
still
wants
flavor
that
the
macros
dont
have
definitely
an
interesting
flavor
but
very
easy
to
drink
o
im
actually
shocked
on
this
one
i
expected
less
but
it
ended
up
being
pretty
decent
overall
impression
i
was
looking
for
more
body
and
more
strength
with
this
brew
very
easy
to
drink
and
some
would
say
a
good
starter
beer
for
the
beginning
of
the
night
or
a
session
enjoyed
the
roasted
malts
and
lager
tastes
but
very
watered
down
at
times
this
is
another
fantastic
offering
from
spoetzl
this
is
a
very
complex
yet
drinkable
schwartzbier
that
just
screams
quality
o
at
one
point
early
in
my
beer
education
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
as
i
am
from
texas
at
this
point
it
is
still
enjoyable
but
not
nearly
one
of
my
favorites
overall
its
not
a
bad
offering
and
apparently
one
of
the
more
popular
offerings
from
shiner
i
suppose
for
many
texans
this
reminds
them
of
shiner
bock
i
dont
see
how
but
its
definitely
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
the
brewery
has
to
offer
poured
into
what
else
my
shiner
pint
shaker
glass
beer
pours
a
nice
inch
and
a
half
of
head
that
quickly
and
almost
completely
dissipates
into
a
very
thin
layer
from
arms
length
the
beer
appears
black
although
its
more
of
a
dark
auburnreddish
brown
im
picking
up
on
a
very
muted
roasty
aroma
here
while
detecting
notes
of
a
sweet
maltiness
heavy
carbonation
makes
this
beer
appear
lighter
to
the
taste
than
id
expect
given
the
sweetmalt
notes
however
that
doesnt
improve
the
taste
its
sweet
a
little
too
sweet
almost
sickingly
so
i
dont
remember
it
tasting
so
unpleasant
as
this
was
one
of
my
goto
beers
during
shiner
specials
could
be
i
liked
it
more
a
year
ago
and
my
tastes
have
radically
changed
or
my
options
in
tejas
expanded
to
where
i
no
longer
drink
it
and
forgot
just
how
it
tasted
either
way
as
a
schwarzbier
it
misses
more
than
hits
cant
say
i
expected
all
that
much
but
im
writing
this
one
off
as
a
letdown
overall
its
a
fairly
wellbalanced
and
rounded
dark
lager
thats
okay
but
not
memorable
or
revisitiable
by
any
means
o
really
good
ive
been
meaning
to
try
this
for
quite
awhile
its
something
i
will
probably
have
more
often
overalland
especially
for
those
just
being
introduced
to
heavier
and
darker
beersthis
is
a
nice
solid
offering
overall
a
pretty
damn
quaffable
beer
better
than
i
was
expecting
would
grab
with
a
meal
at
a
restaurant
pretty
thin
and
watery
i
like
the
roasted
malt
but
not
the
burnt
flavor
that
sneaks
through
i
also
am
not
a
fan
of
how
much
lager
yeast
is
noticeable
over
the
malts
not
awful
but
not
great
overall
of
shiners
offerings
this
is
probably
their
better
ones
but
even
it
is
not
that
spectacular
its
just
mehh
a
nice
beer
and
not
as
heavy
as
it
looks
o
i
think
shiner
has
provided
a
great
example
of
a
schwarzbier
an
interesting
brew
that
i
would
def
have
again
very
dark
jet
black
liquid
with
a
tan
head
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
some
lacing
but
nothing
noteworthy
smell
was
roasty
very
similar
to
freshly
grind
coffee
beans
some
sugar
and
sweetness
in
the
taste
but
a
nice
bitter
backbone
nice
thick
and
oily
mouthfeel
very
carbonated
best
from
shiner
thus
far
but
still
nothing
over
the
top
pours
mostly
opaque
black
with
thin
offwhite
to
tan
head
subtle
grainy
malt
aroma
a
touch
of
roasted
coffee
toasted
flavor
bready
with
some
coffee
and
roast
malt
barely
a
hint
of
floral
hops
decent
smooth
mouthfeel
definitely
a
balanced
beer
with
good
drinkability
o
overall
an
easy
dark
beer
to
drink
not
a
premier
beer
but
with
a
try
especially
if
you
like
dark
flavors
but
cant
commit
to
the
deep
cuts
of
heavy
beer
came
in
a
shiner
family
pack
all
in
all
it
was
decent
not
one
that
i
would
ever
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
but
not
an
unenjoyable
experience
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
mostly
black
with
a
bit
of
ruby
shining
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
thin
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
behind
aroma
is
coffee
some
darkly
toasted
grain
and
a
bit
of
something
sweet
on
the
end
i
know
this
sounds
bizarre
but
i
almost
got
a
faint
hint
of
grape
soda
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
on
this
beer
and
i
think
its
biggest
downfall
is
its
carbonation
the
bubbles
are
very
large
like
coca
cola
or
club
soda
not
something
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
oh
well
better
finish
drinking
it
before
it
goes
flat
poured
a
nice
dark
cola
brown
with
a
wispy
eggshell
head
that
receded
to
a
patchy
layer
dark
roasty
malts
in
the
aroma
with
notes
of
coffee
and
sugar
more
roasted
malts
in
the
taste
toffee
semisweet
chocolate
and
a
coffee
bitterness
practically
no
hops
detectable
not
as
smooth
as
some
schwarzbiers
ive
had
but
i
still
liked
it
a
lot
mediumbodied
dry
finish
and
quite
drinkable
summary
shiner
black
is
one
of
my
favorite
any
day
beers
it
is
drinkable
in
any
season
with
many
meals
as
well
as
fairly
enjoyable
on
its
own
there
is
nothing
particularly
special
about
black
with
mouthfeel
being
the
least
spectacular
but
as
a
casual
beer
i
have
enjoyed
it
smells
is
smooth
rich
with
malts
and
coffee
and
toffee
flavors
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
a
tad
bitter
on
the
end
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
appears
black
in
the
glass
but
when
held
to
the
light
it
is
really
more
of
a
very
deep
crimson
red
a
light
head
that
quickly
breaks
up
to
just
a
thin
ring
with
continuous
carbonation
rising
to
keep
the
ring
in
tact
the
nose
is
mainly
malty
sweet
with
just
hints
of
more
darkly
roasted
malts
which
give
a
slight
burnt
note
taste
is
very
similar
with
the
sweeter
notes
coming
through
early
and
the
slight
astringent
burnt
bitterness
rounding
out
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
in
body
with
a
fairly
aggressive
yet
thin
carbonation
overall
a
decent
tasting
brew
but
not
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
due
to
the
mouth
drying
bitterness
clean
roasty
nose
with
a
light
dusting
of
cocoa
a
crisp
drinker
with
very
light
chocolate
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
lingering
raisin
its
mainly
dry
grainy
roasty
and
quite
quaffable
nice
dry
finish
a
simple
but
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
down
with
ease
o
it
could
be
better
if
it
was
a
little
thinner
and
had
less
carbonation
but
the
roasted
flavor
malty
character
and
bitterness
of
the
hops
is
there
enjoyable
beer
overall
not
the
greatest
by
any
means
but
still
quite
good
shiner
once
again
the
best
value
for
money
in
its
class
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
overallanother
spoetzl
beer
another
just
generic
tasting
beer
nothing
crazy
here
next
beer
please
overall
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
brews
from
spoetzl
overall
a
pretty
generic
schwarzbier
probably
the
best
shiner
ive
had
which
unfortunately
isnt
saying
too
much
not
a
profound
example
of
the
style
but
all
the
elements
actually
come
together
pretty
well
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
easydrinking
beer
with
some
extra
character
the
overall
on
this
beer
is
a
good
one
i
think
the
price
point
rocks
and
they
have
cool
promos
like
the
shiner
family
sixer
that
this
was
in
i
truly
hate
ripping
beers
i
know
the
time
and
effort
and
passion
that
go
into
making
most
though
not
all
craft
beers
but
i
cant
summon
up
the
energy
to
defend
this
one
the
best
i
can
say
about
shiner
bohemian
black
lager
is
that
it
has
a
gently
pleasing
aroma
if
youre
purchasing
this
as
an
air
freshener
great
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
tasty
and
satisfying
beer
i
suggest
you
go
somewhere
else
not
recommended
it
has
typical
schwarzbier
character
roasty
not
as
malty
as
some
not
very
hoppy
its
about
right
and
we
need
to
encourage
the
shiner
people
to
fix
their
usually
boring
brews
pours
a
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzycreamy
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
slightly
roasty
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
nutty
roasty
medium
body
the
finish
is
slightly
bitterdry
a
pretty
tasty
brew
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
picked
this
up
from
central
market
in
fort
worth
while
we
were
staying
with
a
friend
the
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
bubbled
tan
head
starting
at
two
inches
and
settling
into
a
thin
ring
of
head
effervescent
nose
with
slight
floral
aromas
the
taste
is
rather
bland
with
a
slight
sour
tone
and
some
smokey
characteristics
very
light
and
crisp
bodied
with
a
clean
finish
and
minimal
aftertaste
there
is
a
semisweet
and
slightly
sharp
finish
inconsistent
beer
if
that
makes
any
kind
of
sense
pours
dark
brown
nearing
black
with
some
garnet
highlights
and
a
fairly
thin
head
quite
light
in
the
nose
with
some
washed
out
notes
of
lager
yeast
and
the
barest
hint
of
roastiness
the
taste
is
similar
very
light
and
even
somewhat
seltzery
but
the
roastiness
is
slightly
more
pronounced
and
there
is
a
light
cocoa
bitterness
fairly
pleasant
light
in
the
mouth
but
this
is
an
offering
with
more
character
than
the
usual
swill
that
is
acceptable
among
noncraft
drinkers
in
the
south
o
this
is
a
good
winter
beer
it
tastes
a
little
cheapwatery
so
im
not
quite
sure
ill
ever
make
it
a
session
beer
for
someone
who
is
new
to
craft
beers
this
might
be
a
nice
way
to
expand
hisher
palate
part
of
the
shiner
variety
pack
a
rare
style
but
one
of
my
personal
favorites
pours
a
nice
dark
red
almost
black
offwhite
head
to
it
smell
is
nice
and
roasty
taste
is
medium
bodied
great
mouthfeel
and
nice
balance
going
down
finishes
clean
and
smooth
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
pretty
impressed
by
this
one
compared
to
others
of
this
style
its
definitely
better
than
average
a
nice
drinker
this
shiner
mixed
pack
is
starting
to
look
like
a
solid
mix
o
i
thought
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
beer
to
drink
the
combination
of
lightness
with
characteristics
of
a
dark
brew
seem
to
make
this
one
something
to
enjoy
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
overall
this
a
pretty
standard
dark
lager
i
enjoyed
the
variety
of
shiner
and
will
have
more
reviews
to
come
for
the
others
poured
thin
black
smelled
like
a
beer
huh
flavor
was
like
a
beer
too
sarcasm
aside
a
nicer
drink
with
some
malt
notes
and
a
hint
of
roast
carbon
copy
mouthfeel
not
unpleasant
overall
a
decent
swing
at
the
classic
but
too
much
like
a
light
lager
to
squarely
hit
the
mark
shiner
is
awesome
they
can
improve
this
i
like
a
good
dark
beer
and
this
has
some
of
the
flavor
but
by
the
end
of
it
i
was
not
tasting
much
i
like
something
that
keeps
it
taste
till
the
end
of
the
bottleglass
for
as
dark
as
it
looks
i
did
expect
more
on
the
nose
and
taste
o
id
pass
unless
you
are
looking
for
something
that
goes
down
easy
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
with
this
one
overall
a
decent
beer
if
you
want
to
go
the
malty
and
chocolatey
route
on
a
budget
its
got
a
nice
color
but
its
lacking
complexity
o
overall
this
was
somewhat
unbalanced
the
blending
between
the
hops
and
malts
gave
it
an
off
flavor
something
just
didnt
balance
it
out
it
wasnt
terrible
and
ive
had
a
lot
worse
flavor
is
equally
as
roastychocolatey
sweet
no
complexity
at
all
much
like
all
the
shiners
ive
had
i
drink
this
with
all
sorts
of
grilled
meats
especially
boneless
beef
ribs
d
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
not
much
depth
to
this
beer
didnt
get
much
off
it
besides
some
faint
hops
in
the
aftertaste
smooth
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
lot
going
on
d
a
good
brew
overall
but
falls
short
of
the
artistic
expressions
offered
by
the
german
brewers
despite
all
of
this
it
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
should
be
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
it
almost
makes
the
beer
go
down
like
carbonated
water
at
first
the
body
is
somewhere
around
mediumlight
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
lager
another
solid
beer
from
spoetzl
im
having
much
better
luck
with
their
sideline
beers
than
i
did
with
their
abysmal
bock
flagship
notes
not
my
favorite
schwarzbier
as
the
nose
and
flavor
is
just
to
light
faint
and
doesnt
have
that
rich
flavor
just
kind
of
an
earthy
slightly
burnt
malt
flavor
sure
you
it
went
down
easy
but
there
are
much
better
schwarzbiers
and
beers
that
i
would
want
instead
of
this
well
color
me
surprised
i
dont
know
why
but
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
beer
its
good
especially
considering
the
low
abv
so
few
brewers
can
make
a
tasty
low
abv
beer
this
is
nothing
if
not
flavorful
lots
packed
into
this
package
the
nose
is
very
grainy
and
rustic
with
raw
wheat
roast
a
little
coffee
and
a
mild
sweetness
that
has
some
caramel
and
sugar
theres
also
a
mild
metallic
character
up
front
but
that
fades
hop
character
is
faint
and
rather
unnoticeable
very
clean
theres
no
offflavors
from
the
yeast
here
the
palate
opens
roasts
with
a
mild
grainy
acidity
that
brings
to
mind
watery
coffee
grounds
while
that
doesnt
sound
very
appealing
in
a
schwarzbier
it
is
sweetness
is
low
tempered
by
the
mild
bitterness
thats
imparted
by
the
grain
i
get
a
little
bit
of
cola
a
faint
caramel
note
and
not
much
else
simpler
than
the
best
of
the
style
this
finishes
a
touch
watery
and
with
a
blend
of
mild
bitterness
mild
acidity
and
a
little
coffee
light
in
body
with
high
carbonation
this
is
decent
d
i
believe
this
maybe
the
best
shiner
beer
i
ever
had
session
able
abv
nice
body
full
of
flavor
but
roasty
factor
is
a
bit
aggressive
the
most
affordable
swartz
i
found
to
date
at
9
99
a
sixer
try
it
if
you
havent
not
bad
for
being
from
a
brewery
that
i
am
accustomed
to
being
disappointed
by
this
one
is
not
bad
wish
shiner
would
make
every
beer
like
this
one
i
suppose
it
is
drinkable
enough
but
more
than
anything
else
it
is
simply
not
a
very
memorable
beer
if
offered
one
id
drink
it
but
like
the
other
shiner
beers
ive
recently
tried
i
dont
know
that
id
search
this
beer
out
dark
brown
color
with
no
head
at
all
smell
is
non
existent
at
all
little
flavor
to
speak
of
just
booze
mouthfeel
is
lite
and
watery
and
not
too
much
to
speak
of
drinkability
is
a
35
not
too
good
drink
is
pretty
good
dry
crisp
finish
smooth
and
light
abv
very
sessionable
bit
of
stickiness
soso
looks
dark
and
heavy
but
the
taste
isnt
very
strong
i
think
its
characteristic
of
the
style
but
it
comes
across
as
a
good
presentation
of
just
an
okay
beer
an
average
beer
but
good
for
shiner
pours
a
very
dark
brownruby
colored
body
which
would
appear
as
black
in
low
lighting
with
a
tanbrown
1
5inch
head
which
dwindles
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
smells
of
smokey
dark
chocolate
and
a
toffeelike
sweetness
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
subtle
hints
of
coffee
and
smoke
then
a
hoppy
kick
unfortunately
the
beer
finishes
with
a
carbonatedwater
like
taste
and
feel
which
really
kind
of
ends
up
making
the
beer
feel
thin
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
that
strange
co2
water
feel
at
the
end
has
to
knock
back
the
score
this
tastes
alot
like
an
american
lager
with
roasted
malts
if
i
were
going
for
a
black
beer
i
would
much
prefer
monchshof
schwartz
also
i
dont
know
why
i
am
tasting
metal
its
a
bit
off
puting
but
may
be
a
bad
bottle
i
would
probably
not
buy
this
again
but
at
the
same
time
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
d
d
if
you
are
after
a
sortofhassometaste
beer
there
is
nothing
here
to
keep
you
from
drinking
this
not
much
for
smell
and
taste
average
brew
good
for
spoetzl
pretty
poor
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
but
i
dont
mind
finishing
the
single
bottle
i
bought
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
is
lacking
in
comparison
to
classic
examples
of
this
style
the
roast
character
is
a
bit
subdued
with
sweet
caramel
dominating
the
beer
in
a
way
that
almost
makes
it
seem
more
like
a
bock
than
a
black
schwarzbier
the
sweet
finish
only
serves
to
intensify
this
impression
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
a
much
better
offering
than
the
shiner
bock
d
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
in
flavor
this
is
a
forgettable
schwarzbier
very
watery
and
not
that
exciting
d
slightly
too
bitter
deep
dark
flavors
but
watery
and
bland
in
the
face
this
beer
is
balanced
spoetzl
dont
change
a
thing
overall
i
like
the
smoke
flavors
good
for
a
lager
but
way
too
much
carbonation
really
throwing
this
beer
off
somewhat
drinkable
better
than
i
expected
it
was
nice
and
dry
but
a
little
on
the
watery
side
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
lower
abv
makes
this
a
drinker
all
night
without
worrying
about
getting
to
well
drunk
a
nice
beer
that
i
personally
was
surprised
with
ah
inexpensive
bottles
for
my
mixedsixer
love
it
this
one
pours
a
lovely
translucent
garnetbrown
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
roasted
malts
light
coffee
cocoa
powder
and
a
twinge
o
flowers
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cocoa
light
roasted
malts
thick
and
toasted
caramel
and
a
swig
o
roasty
toffee
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
somewhat
surprisingly
nice
schwarz
nothing
too
exciting
but
pretty
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
nonetheless
i
really
like
the
specialty
beers
that
shiner
makes
even
though
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
original
shiner
bock
im
also
accustomed
to
black
lagers
shiner
black
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
find
myself
drawn
to
it
whenever
i
see
that
it
is
available
this
was
the
first
i
had
it
out
of
a
bottle
the
appearance
was
tan
to
a
black
color
the
smell
of
hops
was
strong
when
tasting
it
you
can
taste
a
burnt
flavor
which
is
appetizing
its
easy
to
drink
but
be
careful
because
more
than
a
few
will
get
you
leaning
strong
but
pleasant
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
for
sure
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
light
head
and
not
much
retention
or
lacing
nose
is
crisp
roasted
malt
with
some
light
caramel
and
chocolate
taste
is
roast
with
coffee
and
chocolate
and
some
light
earthy
hops
fairly
light
win
good
carbonation
just
like
others
i
have
had
from
them
this
drinks
well
but
doesnt
pack
much
flavor
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
has
a
very
roasted
malt
start
and
a
really
nice
smooth
smokey
finish
i
poured
this
into
a
pilsner
glass
and
got
a
good
1
inch
almond
colored
thick
head
i
could
easily
drink
multiple
bottles
of
this
american
schwartzbier
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
nice
head
head
recedes
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
smells
average
nothing
great
but
not
bad
a
bit
weak
taste
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
not
much
there
was
expecting
more
of
a
stout
feel
and
this
is
not
it
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
had
the
feel
of
a
cheap
lager
not
a
richer
dark
beer
drinkability
average
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
wantedexpected
and
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
wouldnt
turn
down
another
but
wouldnt
pay
for
it
either

drinkability
i
have
no
trouble
putting
a
6
pack
down
just
sitting
with
my
girlfriend
watching
a
movie
and
playing
some
cards
shiner
bohemian
black
is
a
great
drink
that
isnt
to
thick
to
sit
heavy
on
your
stomach
and
its
not
so
thin
youre
needing
to
run
to
the
bathroom
every
15
minutes
i
love
this
beer
for
social
events
overall
a
decent
beer
d
one
hell
of
a
schwarzbier
that
i
would
love
to
get
alot
of
has
beautiful
drinkablity
and
a
flavor
that
only
makes
you
want
more
cheers
notes
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
its
dark
and
tasty
yet
supper
easy
to
drink
i
have
had
this
beer
numerous
times
over
the
years
and
it
has
always
been
my
favorite
shiner
beer
i
never
remembered
the
smoke
in
the
beer
before
so
i
am
not
sure
if
i
always
just
missed
it
or
if
this
batch
was
smokier
than
others
in
the
past
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
has
a
slight
chewiness
to
it
overall
a
pretty
decent
schwarzbier
i
wouldnt
mind
if
the
roast
was
kicked
up
a
tad
bit
or
maybe
an
element
of
dark
chocolate
just
something
to
add
a
little
more
complexity
very
drinkable
and
would
certainly
have
again

decent

spoetzl
kind
of
confuses
me
are
they
going
for
utmost
quality
or
do
they
just
sort
of
wing
some
of
their
stuff
reminds
me
of
saranac
when
it
comes
to
quality
would
like
to
enjoy
this
on
tap
d
something
perhaps
to
best
be
enjoyed
with
a
simply
seasoned
cut
of
beef
d
very
drinkable
something
i
wont
be
afraid
to
recommend
or
add
to
my
personal
rotation
drinkability
for
a
darker
bockstyle
the
toasted
flavor
is
neither
too
intense
nor
too
smokeinfused
the
discernable
presence
of
hops
makes
give
it
some
mild
complexity
definitely
worth
trying
this
is
an
overall
spectacular
brew
i
rank
it
amongst
my
favorites
it
is
the
lightest
of
the
beers
i
regularly
drink
i
tend
to
lean
towards
stone
double
bastard
and
dogfish
head
90
minute
iipa
when
i
want
something
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
not
much
to
this
one
it
was
even
kind
of
a
chore
to
drink
as
all
the
flavors
are
quite
muted
nothing
i
would
be
looking
for
again
but
hey
it
was
cheap
overall
it
was
not
a
bad
black
lager
this
is
one
of
my
more
favorite
brews
from
the
spoetzl
brewery
i
would
not
mind
having
this
one
again
and
would
easily
choose
it
over
the
bock
i
thought
it
had
a
refreshing
quality
that
seemed
fitting
for
the
tx
heat
definetely
a
session
black
lager
although
black
lagers
are
sessionable
to
begin
with
so
maybe
a
good
six
pack
available
session
lager
m
a
little
too
much
on
the
carbonation
perhaps
the
body
is
fairly
light
and
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
has
an
aggressive
head
that
was
3
fingers
thick
milk
chocolate
brown
that
left
minimal
lacing
but
settled
to
a
nice
1
finger
cap
the
aroma
is
faint
but
some
burnt
caramel
and
coffee
are
present
the
taste
is
of
mild
chocolate
some
slight
coffee
and
a
little
burnt
caramel
light
carbonation
and
medium
body
not
the
best
dark
lager
i
have
had
but
a
decent
brew
a
nice
drinker
nothing
terribly
complex
but
also
nothing
terribly
wrong
with
this
either
id
recommend
now
what
distinguishes
the
bohemian
black
lager
from
shiner
bock
not
a
lot
actually
basically
the
flavor
is
smoothed
out
quite
a
bit
traces
of
caramel
and
chocolaty
malts
now
complete
with
less
bitter
aftertaste
this
beer
is
certainly
more
likable
than
shiner
proper
but
the
new
flavor
profile
isnt
strong
enough
to
overcome
my
affinity
for
the
original
i
had
this
beer
right
after
the
session
black
from
full
sail
and
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
not
as
good
both
beers
are
well
priced
and
dark
lagers
but
the
full
sail
has
a
richer
mouthfeel
and
longer
finish
i
think
this
is
an
ok
beer
and
if
i
was
in
texas
i
would
probably
seek
it
out
but
in
the
pnw
the
session
black
is
the
better
beer
at
a
better
price
d
not
bad
i
just
wish
it
were
more
of
what
its
trying
to
be
drinkability
very
good
beer
but
still
a
little
too
thick
for
me
to
go
back
for
a
few
more
times
i
wouldnt
mind
at
all
having
it
in
the
fridge
for
one
every
now
and
then
i
used
to
love
this
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
anymore
d
very
easy
to
drink
not
too
strong
but
definitely
not
weak
tastes
like
a
smoked
porter
but
drinks
much
easier
very
nice
notes
overall
quite
refreshing
and
light
i
think
it
makes
a
great
alternative
to
heavier
stoutsporters
and
i
like
it
much
better
than
say
something
like
a
light
lager
it
maintains
some
complexity
and
depth
of
flavor
while
still
being
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
weaker
flavors
and
light
feel
its
descent
for
a
black
lager
but
i
would
definetly
appreciate
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
and
more
substantial
body
serving
type
bottle
d
overall
not
a
bad
little
brew
low
abv
and
nice
flavors
nothing
too
outstanding
but
a
nice
brew
from
the
spoetzl
brewery
dark
brown
maybe
some
black
in
center
clear
and
ruby
edges
with
a
two
finger
head
and
light
lacing
aroma
is
slightly
subdued
but
there
is
a
touch
of
roasty
and
chocolate
notes
going
on
a
but
grainy
shiners
mo
and
no
hoppiness
taste
is
right
along
with
the
aroma
lightl
cocoa
some
caramel
and
a
teeny
tiny
bit
of
roast
make
up
the
flavor
profile
some
grainy
bready
like
base
malts
underneath
and
a
fading
light
bitterness
along
with
a
nutty
sweetness
on
the
finish
not
too
sweet
and
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
is
smooth
carbonation
just
on
the
verge
of
creamy
not
a
bad
a
beer
by
any
means
probably
the
best
out
of
this
mixed
12
pack
so
far
d
pretty
tame
for
the
style
nothing
wrong
just
not
very
impressive
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
from
shiner
id
buy
this
over
shiner
bock
any
day
i
love
the
aesthetic
but
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
dissapointment
drinkability
is
high
this
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
great
session
beer
for
people
who
want
a
lighter
beer
with
richer
flavor
than
a
typical
lager
d
alright
but
certainly
nothing
special
however
it
is
drinkable
and
refreshing
enough
that
it
makes
a
solid
session
beer
or
something
to
have
on
a
hot
afternoon
very
dark
with
a
slight
red
hue
when
held
to
the
light
decent
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
bit
but
not
not
as
long
as
it
should
not
much
to
smell
tastes
of
coffee
roasted
malts
a
little
nutty
and
a
hit
of
cocoa
its
a
little
thin
and
light
for
a
black
but
it
has
a
little
more
complexity
than
most
shiner
offerings
which
we
have
plenty
of
around
here
really
quite
drinkable
its
a
drinkable
beer
not
phenomenal
d
drinkability
is
nice
beer
tastes
fairly
good
and
goes
down
pretty
quickly
i
could
see
myself
putting
down
a
sixer
in
a
night
if
that
was
what
i
desired
thick
and
heavy
poured
into
a
pint
glass
formed
a
1
dark
tan
head
above
the
clear
burgundy
brew
head
fades
ever
so
slowly
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
wisps
of
rich
dark
malt
but
not
enough
taste
is
moderate
dark
sweetness
balancing
bitterness
and
a
creamy
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
easy
good
stuff
the
pour
created
two
fingers
worth
of
lightbrowndeeptan
head
that
quickly
fell
like
wile
e
coyote
going
over
a
cliff
while
holding
an
acme
co
anvil
the
label
read
dont
be
afraid
of
the
dark
and
while
i
am
not
a
shrinking
violet
this
beer
might
be
scary
to
the
uninitiated
they
may
have
called
it
black
but
it
was
really
a
deep
dark
brown
with
beautiful
ruby
highlights
the
nose
was
chocolaty
with
dried
dark
fruit
like
raisins
i
thought
of
a
cadbury
fruit
nut
bar
initially
wow
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
with
only
the
co2
giving
it
any
real
body
nuts
still
the
taste
was
very
pleasant
slightly
chocolaty
slightly
smoky
just
right
after
a
long
workday
the
finish
was
again
chocolate
with
a
light
smokiness
the
abv
made
it
a
welcome
addition
to
my
day
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
more
often
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
chocolate
some
notes
of
coffee
taste
is
like
the
smell
malty
and
coffee
some
hints
of
chocolate
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
update
it
sort
of
grows
on
you
and
as
it
warms
it
really
gets
better
theres
more
flavor
as
it
gets
warmer
less
bitterness
and
smoke
and
more
malt
and
hops
its
getting
to
be
an
interesting
beer
my
advice
is
let
it
warm
for
a
few
minutes
before
you
start
on
this
one
it
helps
a
lot
d
this
beer
wasnt
bad
it
struck
me
as
odd
to
have
two
distinct
flavors
and
not
a
real
middle
ground
here
i
would
suggest
letting
this
one
warm
up
a
little
before
taking
that
first
sip
yawn
only
one
more
shiner
sample
left
saw
this
at
the
liquor
store
and
found
myself
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
lager
unfortunately
this
is
nothing
like
any
of
the
other
german
dark
lagers
i
have
tried
it
looked
promising
on
the
pour
and
the
smell
was
malty
and
slightly
sweet
unfortunately
the
overwhelming
flavor
is
blandness
easy
to
drink
but
very
mediocre
i
also
found
the
shiner
bock
to
be
pretty
underwhelming
too
so
i
guess
this
brand
just
isnt
to
my
taste
its
not
bad
but
theres
really
nothing
i
can
reccomend
about
it
either

drinkability
this
beer
is
a
step
up
from
marcos
but
it
doesnt
make
me
what
to
crack
open
another
d
not
a
summer
night
lawnmower
beer
obviously
but
it
would
be
easy
to
put
six
of
these
away
not
distinguished
in
any
way
and
has
a
muddled
character
pass
if
you
want
a
good
craft
beer
woe
is
me
shiner
d
somewhat
tasty
not
very
filling
goes
down
relatively
easily
nothing
completely
stands
out
but
there
are
better
offerings
of
this
style
rjt
shiners
always
been
a
good
basic
brew
for
a
go
to
when
nothing
else
is
available
and
you
dont
want
your
taste
buds
to
suffer
this
is
a
classic
beer
they
drink
in
germany
lets
give
it
a
whirl
smells
not
much
different
than
a
macro
lager
could
be
a
golden
lager
as
far
as
the
nose
goes
pours
to
a
very
dark
darker
than
root
beer
color
letting
just
a
little
light
through
head
is
micro
bubble
and
creamy
taste
is
thinner
than
i
expected
again
not
much
different
than
an
american
golden
lager
but
with
the
difference
being
a
hint
of
black
licorice
finish
is
kind
of
funky
with
a
bit
of
mouthpuckering
skunkiness
as
an
afiicionado
of
darker
brews
i
was
pumped
for
this
one
but
it
is
a
let
down
wont
be
drinking
anymore
of
this
brew
drinkability
was
average
and
didnt
impress
any
i
love
beer
and
i
hate
wasting
money
so
i
will
certainly
drink
it
all
but
its
nothing
better
than
average
drinkable
about
like
water
i
think
id
rather
have
water
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
low
carbonation
inoffensive
served
lightlychilled
in
a
widemouthed
goblet
d
not
bad
nothing
outstanding
but
could
work
for
a
session
brew
d
this
is
shiners
most
complex
and
flavorful
beer
very
good
with
central
texas
bbq
it
has
a
wonderful
dark
malt
character
but
is
easy
to
drink
poured
a
light
black
if
possible
body
with
minimal
head
and
a
little
lacing
some
roasted
and
sweet
malt
smells
are
very
minor
and
not
much
hops
at
all
light
bodied
with
little
sweet
or
roasted
malt
presence
and
very
little
hops
but
has
a
little
bit
of
dry
crispness
in
the
backend
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
very
simple
rather
not
much
taste
at
all
but
still
easy
to
drink
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
d
not
a
bad
effort
but
it
lacks
some
oomph
the
carbonation
is
definitely
too
high
the
flavor
too
low
but
the
drinkability
is
almost
there
i
could
have
a
few
while
watching
a
game
but
id
never
look
for
it
again
poured
into
a
tumbler
it
produces
a
1
inch
thin
tannish
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
appearance
is
black
with
deep
mahogany
around
the
edges
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
roasted
malts
i
dont
pick
up
any
hops
at
all
the
taste
is
malty
with
slight
hop
taste
and
no
bitterness
the
feel
is
surprisingly
thin
bodied
for
such
a
dark
beer
but
i
see
thats
typical
of
the
style
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
poured
jet
black
from
a
mixed
six
bottle
into
my
favorite
pint
dark
dark
dark
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
minimal
lacing
smell
and
taste
was
roasty
toasty
this
was
drinkable
but
i
dont
seem
to
prefer
the
roasty
beers
no
doubt
it
was
good
for
the
style
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
pretty
solid
beer
i
havent
had
a
lot
for
the
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
ahd
drinkability
it
is
cheap
and
everywhere
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
but
thats
typical
for
the
style
and
this
one
refrains
from
getting
too
thin
carbonations
a
little
high
though
i
cant
believe
that
a
dark
beer
is
this
simple
and
drinkable
not
over
carbonated
but
has
a
lighter
head
and
super
dark
looks
roasted
notes
on
smell
and
taste
theres
some
hops
under
there
too
taste
is
one
of
the
smoothest
dark
beers
ever
drinkabiliity
is
session
level
yet
good
beers
not
every
beer
needs
a
thousand
aspects
to
it
black
lager
is
just
a
simple
solid
mocha
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
pretty
nice

perhaps

very
smooth
nothing

one
nonetheless

black
in
color
with
little
light
seeping
through
a
fingernail
of
khaki
colored
head
covers
the
majority
of
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
of
sweet

a
hint
of
smoke
the
flavor
is
packed
with
sweet
and
gently
smoked
sweet
dark
malt
the
mouth
is
thick
silky
and
viscous
this
has
a
ton
of
flavor
and
body
for
a
lager
id
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
it
really
hit
the
spot
o
bit
non
traditional
but
good
very
even
balanced
schwarzbier
certainly
has
the
light
to
lightmed
body
with
the
moderate
level
of
roasted
malted
sweetness
avery
dark
brown
to
black
except
when
held
to
the
light
where
it
turns
a
very
dark
red
a
single
finger
of
tan
caramel
head
that
remains
throughout
even
if
very
faint
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
svery
roasty
pretty
well
burnt
toasty
malt
aromas
treally
awesome
combo
of
the
roasted
malty
nuttiness
with
an
under
abundant
very
dark
chocolate
bitter
finish
i
didnt
get
a
whole
bunch
in
the
way
of
hoppy
bitterness
or
earthiness
ofantastic
well
balanced
scwarzbier
by
well
balanced
i
mean
not
too
sweet
or
overroasted
bitter
a
really
tasty
lighter
bodied
blackbier
picked
up
this
little
beauty
after
my
beer
guru
clued
me
in
on
sprecher
gould
it
at
super
subs
and
six
packs
in
dubois
outstanding
looking
beer
with
plenty
of
malt
and
smoke
for
the
nose
very
tasty
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
hope
to
have
again
in
the
future
and
i
hope
to
try
other
of
the
sprecher
beers
o
a
tasty
very
drinkable
beer
this
americanbrewed
schwartzbier
gives
any
germanbrewed
example
a
run
for
its
money
overall
a
marvelous
beer
light
in
body
and
soft
in
flavor
but
still
immensely
flavorful
paired
excellently
with
my
slowsmoked
ribs
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
would
highly
recommend
could
be
a
great
beer
as
a
soft
introduction
to
roasted
malt
beers
this
is
a
tasty
beer
fully
deserving
of
the
high
rating
it
gets
on
ba
highest
rated
beer
in
found
in
the
cooler
of
an
out
of
town
beer
dispensary
good
choice
repeatable
good
beer
pours
very
dark
reddishbrown
almost
black
really
with
about
a
1finger
beige
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
with
some
spotty
lacing
seen
around
the
glass
aroma
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
for
the
most
part
the
taste
has
more
going
on
with
toffee
caramel
molasses
with
light
coffee
lots
of
flavors
going
on
but
not
overwhelming
like
some
others
smooth
taste
with
just
a
very
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
that
didnt
linger
overall
very
pleasing
i
like
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
body
with
good
head
and
minor
lace
retention
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
grainy
lager
like
with
touches
of
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
the
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
balance
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolatecaramel
sweetness
and
finishes
dry
this
wouldve
received
a
higher
score
but
for
some
reason
at
times
i
get
this
weird
oily
aftertaste
which
i
assume
must
be
something
only
i
have
encountered
bc
it
doesnt
make
sense
overall
very
nice
beer
easy
drinking
flavors
are
balanced
and
go
well
with
a
cold
winter
night
or
hot
summers
day
not
the
first
schwarzbier
ive
had
but
it
seems
to
be
the
first
one
ive
reviewed
i
enjoyed
this
one
while
cooking
up
a
huge
pot
of
pasta
sauce
and
planning
a
lecture
on
the
nine
point
circle
for
a
geometry
course
im
teaching
next
academic
year
my
mom
is
from
germany
and
she
told
me
once
that
schwarzbier
is
what
german
women
drink
when
theyre
pregnant
perhaps
that
explains
a
lot
about
my
own
personal
love
of
beer
cheers
o
theres
a
good
reason
sprechers
black
bavarian
continues
to
command
medal
after
medal
in
worldrenown
competitions
its
that
good
this
is
a
dark
beer
thats
a
great
trainingwheel
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
dark
beer
its
also
a
great
dark
beer
for
people
thirsting
after
a
dark
beer
without
the
hefty
body
or
higher
alcohol
black
bavarian
has
the
perfect
malt
combination
to
balance
sweetness
with
chocolaty
lightly
roasted
notes
for
exceptional
smoothness
and
drinkability
may
the
schwarz
be
with
you
o
a
very
good
beer
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
it
a
nice
sipping
beer
wish
the
acridmetallic
character
werent
evident
good
combination
of
roast
and
toasted
malt
the
acridmetallic
character
goes
away
eventually
so
my
score
is
reflective
of
that
o
delicious
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
black
lagers
and
this
didnt
disappoint
i
really
enjoyed
its
deep
bitterness
and
its
carbonation
is
more
than
i
am
used
to
since
i
drink
a
lot
of
porters
and
stouts
so
it
was
very
nice
for
a
change
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
dark
smooth
wellbalanced
very
enjoyable
black
lager
this
beer
is
the
highest
rated
of
all
of
sprechers
it
is
possible
that
german
beer
is
just
not
my
thing
but
i
was
underwhelmed
it
was
sweet
but
not
in
the
way
of
hop
lacking
it
might
just
not
be
what
i
am
used
to
i
have
never
been
to
bavaria
but
from
the
taste
of
this
beer
im
not
going
there
anytime
soon
either
o
one
of
the
better
schwarzbiers
ive
tried
a
great
sipper
even
better
as
it
warms
o
still
plowing
through
the
christmas
leftovers
this
is
one
of
sprechers
better
offerings
dark
brown
approaching
black
the
flavors
of
the
roasted
malt
the
sweetness
the
coffee
tones
the
tang
from
the
acid
i
feel
as
though
all
of
these
are
more
pronounced
in
a
schwarzbier
than
in
a
porter
or
stout
the
lager
yeast
just
doesnt
impart
as
many
flavors
as
an
ale
yeast
not
a
negative
or
a
positive
just
an
observation
i
dont
know
how
traditional
this
beer
is
as
its
very
well
hopped
there
is
a
firm
bitterness
throughout
personally
i
feel
like
this
is
a
good
thing
because
many
of
the
german
beer
which
include
a
lot
of
dark
roasted
malts
are
overly
sweet
all
in
all
highly
recommended
what
a
wonderful
beer
i
frist
smelled
malty
and
i
was
was
worried
but
the
taste
is
wonder
full
tastey
wow
just
a
great
beer
i
want
to
drink
all
night
just
a
renowned
smoothness
and
a
creamy
tan
head
that
i
lovve
enjoy
people
its
a
winner
for
a
winter
night
it
warms
the
soul
on
a
summer
night
it
continues
life
love
this
drink
smile
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
like
to
try
different
beers
and
i
do
this
would
be
a
great
beer
with
german
food
its
a
great
beer
to
just
enjoy
too
the
low
abv
makes
it
sessionable
o
this
a
good
brew
easy
drinker
and
lots
of
flavor
and
aromas
pours
out
to
a
nice
tan
head
that
laces
a
bit
and
sticks
around
black
color
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
roasted
but
very
muted
which
is
on
style
flavor
is
more
of
same
with
sweet
malt
balanced
by
the
black
malt
and
soft
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
on
heavy
side
but
slick
and
smooth
i
love
the
way
this
brew
feels
overall
a
very
good
schwarz
mouthfeel
is
awesome
feels
creamy
light
clean
crisp
and
very
refreshing
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive

in

overall
i

to
give
this

id
happily
drink
it
again
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
its
a
schwarzbier
yet
one
of
the
top
examples
of
the
style
according
to
ba
luckily
im
finding
this
one
pretty
damn
good
probably
the
best
schwarz
ive
had
yet
in
fact
honestly
before
trying
this
beer
i
only
thought
of
sprecher
as
a
good
soda
company
i
have
always
overlooked
their
beers
ive
definitely
learned
my
lesson
and
will
try
more
of
their
beers
in
the
future
the
beer
has
a
near
black
body
with
a
soft
creamy
khaki
colored
head
the
aroma
brings
dark
chocolates
roast
charred
malt
a
bit
of
dark

easy

medium
in

with

a
touch

flavor
as
well
a
solid
example
of
the
style
i
would
drink
this
again
oa
tasty
beer
with
great
body
and
easy
drinkability
black
beer
go
figure
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
leaning
towards
coffee
and
a
whiff
of
eurohops
flavor
up
front
is
very
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
i
perceive
more
bitterness
from
the
hops
rather
than
from
the
roasted
grain
finish
tastes
roasty
burnt
ashy
and
almost
smokey
carbonation
isnt
too
strong
a
little
heavy
and
sticky
overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
but
the
mouthfeel
kind
of
weighs
it
down
i
poured
a
couple
of
times
due
to
its
desire
to
jump
up
to
the
top
of
the
glass
once
it
finished
i
had
a
finger
of
dense
deepbrown
head
that
sat
atop
the
beer
like
a
petulant
child
who
refuses
to
go
to
their
room
when
directed
i
was
going
to
spank
it
before
i
realized
that
it
had
the
power
to
spank

color
was

deep
darkbrown
that
allowed
just
enough
light
to
penetrate
to
show
off

was
thick

is
this
a

beer

with

head
decent
retention
and
some
lacing
nose
is
faint
but
mostly
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
there
being
several
sweet
flavors
including
malt
chocolate
and
caramel
a
small
bit
of
coffee
can
be
detected
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
not
particularly
memorable

decent
beer

somewhat

has
a

with

smell
is
mild
some
roasted
malts
taste
is
also
mild
light
coffee
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
easy
drinking
but
just
a
bit
bland
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
great
this
is
the
brew
that
converted
me
to
american
craft
bier
7
years
ago
and
im
glad
to
see
its
still
great
just
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
o
schwarzbier
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
until
i
get
a
chance
to
visit
germany
black
bavarian
will
be
my
benchmark
to
what
all
other
schwarzbiers
are
compared
and
even
then
i
might
so
far
non
have
come
close
find
this

the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
schwarzbier
nicely
robust
with
good
balance
and
complexity
of
flavors
very
smooth
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
drinks
like
a
sweet
malty
dessert
tons
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malty
without
being
cloying
in
general
a
fantastic
late
winter
brew
its
mouth
filling
but
finishes
wonderfully
the
somewhat
high
alcohol
content
is
not
obtrusive
because
the
beer
invites
slow
savoring
as
the
temperature
of
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
profile
becomes
more
pronounced
and
encourages
even
more
measured
drinking
oa
good
beer
to
have
when
you
crave
the
taste
of
a
dark
beer
but
are
looking
for
something
with
higher
drinkability
pretty
solid
but
i
think
the
malt
used
is
just
a
bit
overcooked
as
its
a
little
too
burnt
for
what
id
like
in
a
dark
lager
another
solid
beer
from
sprecher
o
some
really
nice
dark
flavors
yet
very
drinkable
and
probably
a
little
too
thin
i
like
this
beer
every
once
in
a
while
overall
great
drinkable
german
dark
beer
and
the
best
beer
from
sprecher
this
beer
pours
black
period
it
has
a
14
inch
head
and
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
of
anise
molasses
and
burnt
toast
the
flavor
opens
with
dark
roasted
malt
bakers
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
with
a
hint
of
wood
and
smoke
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
sprecher
black
bavarian
is
a
good
brew
recommended
o
a
well
crafted
beer
that
any
stout
lover
should
try
overall
this
is
a
tough
style
to
do
well
it
has
all
the
elements
for
a
good
schwarzbeir
but
just
not
strong
enough
in
the
flavor
o
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
with
a
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
flavor
i
think
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
even
in
the
summer
definitely
one
to
have
again
black
bavarian
schwarzbier
is
a
subtle
drinakble
and
surprisingly
variable
beer
that
shows
more
flexibility
than
is
normal
for
the
narrowly
focused
style
this
is
one
excellent
black
lager
smooth
yet
rich
wellbalanced
throughout
and
presenting
a
lot
of
dark
beer
complexity
to
your
palate
well
worth
checking
out
edit
wait
this
is
the
highest
ranked
schwarzbier
on
the
site
facepalm
drink
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
land
of
one
these
from
a
generous
ba
nice
balance
with
good
hoppy
bitter
roasty
flavors
notes
what
a
remarkable
lager
very
well
done
cheers
do
sooo
incredibly
easy
drinking
sprecher
nailed
it
a
first
for
me
if
you
ever
get
the
dark
beer
is
so
thick
from
others
then
this
may
be
a
prime
example
of
how
thats
just
plain
wrong
sixteen
ounce
bottles
brilliant
o
a
combination
of
light
drinkable
malts
and
some
darker
smoke
and
wood
flavors
overall
pretty
good
o
pretty
good
example
of
an
american
attempt
at
the
schwarzbier
very
drinkable
and
interesting
warming
complexity
is
excellent
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
i
would
recommend
it
m
a
bit
thin
when
compared
to
the
big
taste
overall
i
had
to
take
the
overall
score
down
since
i
cant
find
this
around
my
area
but
it
was
a
very
good
black
lager
smooth
and
drinkable
o
like
i
said
one
of
my
favorite
sprecher
offerings
not
an
overpowering
schwarzbier
but
one
thats
quite
palatable
always
nice
to
come
across
this
beer
one
of
the
bigger
examples
of
the
style
out
there
and
one
of
the
better
in
my
opinion
o
surpisingly
wellbalanced
really
enjoyed
this
one
easy
drinking
not
a
palate
killer
with
the
heavy
malts
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
some
light
white
head
smells
roasty
but
mostly
nonaromatic
tastes
sweet
and
malty
definitely
a
lager
well
carbonated
good
mouthfeel
overall
very
refreshing
overall
one
of
the
best
schwarzbiers
ive
had
to
date
of
the
few
schwarzbiers
ive
had
this
is
an
excellent
one
i
might
actually
prefer
the
rogue
version
to
this
but
for
price
and
availability
this
is
top
overall
good
beer
overall
unfortunately
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
unique
beer
from
a
very
good
brewery
there
is
complex
flavors
but
its
not
a
fillyouup
type
of
beer
like
some
complex
stouts
probably
one
of
if
not
the
best
beers
made
in
milwaukee
definitely
a
must
try
for
those
in
the
area
overall
its
a
nice
beer
the
only
example
ive
tried
of
the
style
i
do
give
two
schlitz
for
sprecher
black
bavarian
if
youre
fortunate
to
be
in
an
area
that
distributes
sprecher
products
this
is
worth
tracking
down
overall
im
not
sure
i
understand
the
love
for
this
brew
it
tastes
pretty
pedestrian
to
me
just
a
whole
lot
of
nothing
unoffensive
but
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
o
remarkable
balanced
for
big
malt
bomb
lots
of
flavor
not
too
sweet
sharply
bitter
in
the
finish
still
getting
used
to
the
style
as
it
looks
and
smells
like
a
porter
or
stout
the
smell
especially
reminds
me
of
a
quality
porter
with
rich
cocoacoffee
aroma
with
perhaps
a
slight
medicinalbandaid
to
it
it
is
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
i
recognize
this
is
a
lager
there
is
nothing
that
especially
makes
me
want
to
keep
this
on
the
tongue
nor
am
i
reluctant
to
drink
it
in
gulps
its
a
good
beer
but
id
be
hard
pressed
to
find
the
right
occassion
for
it
perhaps
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
beer
on
a
warm
summer
night
overall
i
did
enjoy
it
alot
was
not
disappointed
overall
and
would
try
again
to
see
if
it
grows
on
me
even
more

they
leave
me
feeling
like
they
can
get
the
flavor
profile
they
want
and
deliver
now
just
follow
through
on
the
whole
experience
and
this
could
be
a
holy
smokes
thats
some
good
beer
easily

little

well
after
the
swallow
erupts
the
taste
buds
very
nicely
makes
for
a
very
good
slowing
drinking
beer
as
its
not
something
you
should
consider
chugging
down
good
example
of
the
style
really
drinkable
and
a
great
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
one
o
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
dark
beer
if
youre
looking
for
that
typical
roasted
malt
hit
but
i
wish
there
was
just
a
slight
bit
more
sweetness
and
smoothness
you
get
from
a
classic
schwarzbier
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
has
a
high
drinkability
good
stuff
overall
a
decent
beer
would
have
it
again
for
sure
a
very
nice
dark
german
lager
with
great
toasted
malt
and
coffee
notes
goes
down
very
easy
and
does
not
overwhelm
despite
its
pronounced
malt
flavor
and
complexity
definitely
worth
repeated
pours
drinkability
is
great
with
absolutely
no
trace
of
alcohol
at
all
by
far
the
best
sprecher
product
ive
tasted
yet
finally
a
beer
from
sprecher
that
actually
impressed
me
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
reay
nice
deep
brown
color
the
head
lasts
for
just
about
entire
time
youre
drinking
the
beer
it
doesnt
leave
a
lot
of
lacing
but
it
still
survived
for
a
while
the
aroma
is
a
really
nicely
roasted
smell
was
minor
hints
or
chocolate
there
wasnt
too
much
of
a
grassy
lager
or
pilsner
aroma
which
very
good
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
really
nice
flavor
to
it
malty
and
roasted
leaving
a
dry
mouthfeel
overall
im
very
glad
to
say
that
i
found
a
brew
the
i
like
from
sprecher
finally
o
its
a
very
good
stout
smooth
not
too
tart
but
good
flavor
bizarre
food
pairing
note
coincidentally
this
beer
paired
so
incredibly
well
with
my
french
onion
soup
i
was
having
for
lunch
that
i
really
have
to
recommend
snacking
on
anything
with
caramelized
onions
onion
rings
a
burger
with
fried
onions
on
top
etc
seriously
both
the
onion
soup
and
the
brew
got
significantly
amplified
in
deliciousness
when
tasted
together
a
nicely
done
beer
lacking
in
aroma
but
that
may
be
the
tulip
i
used
only
clean
glass
i
had
today
a
good
surprise
from
a
brewery
i
have
never
heard
of
and
i
would
pick
it
up
again
regardless
sprecher
should
stick
to
world
class
sodas
excellent
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
i
seriously
thought
this
was
from
germany
until
i
reviewed
it
and
saw
its
actually
from
wi
nice
job
cheeseheads
o
one
of
the
best
and
robust
schwartz
ive
ever
had
dont
ruin
it
with
food
or
worrying
about
pairings
may
the
schwarzbier
with
you
o
44
5
by
about
the
13
oz
mark
this
became
a
sentimental
beer
for
me
it
makes
me
wander
nostalgically
through
distant
memories
of
my
german
youth
even
though
i
have
never
been
to
germany
so
far
as
i
know
its
the
first
sprecher
beer
ive
tried
but
probably
wont
be
my
only
drinking
this
stuff
is
not
like
drinking
most
beers
for
me
at
least
if
i
ever
find
myself
defending
it
ill
have
to
resort
to
something
related
to
my
defense
of
listening
to
the
grateful
dead
its
not
about
technical
virtuosity
or
brilliant
anything
its
about
the
mood
created
and
the
communion
with
now
how
did
that
defense
go
ah
well
peace
a
solid
pretty
much
by
the
book
black
lager
here
those
who
are
looking
for
a
sweeter
richer
schwarzbier
are
going
to
have
to
look
elsewhere
ill
admit
that
i
was
skeptical
about
this
brew
when
i
bought
it
but
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
quality
and
taste
of
this
beer
smooth
tasty
nutty
id
definitely
have
this
brew
again
o
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
seek
it
out
again
o
very
solid
brew
1st
time
i
had
it
i
think
i
served
it
too
cold
and
it
wasnt
nearly
as
good
this
is
a
solid
easy
drinker
that
im
quite
impressed
with
d
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
a
subtle
beauty
brings
back
wonderful
memories
of
discovering
craft
beer
and
enjoying
this
one
from
a
keg
on
a
sunny
spring
day
for
a
friends
bachelor
party
awesome
d
a
very
nice
black
lager
the
strong
roasted
malt
profile
reminds
me
of
a
stout
however
d
having
been
let
down
by
the
dark
lager
style
before
i
approached
this
beer
with
low
expectations
i
went
away
favorably
impressed
finding
the
multilayered
complexity
remarkable
between
the
hints
of
smoke
in
the
smell
and
the
clean
roasted
flavors
this
beer
begs
to
be
paired
with
other
savory
flavors
as
americanbrewed
dark
lagers
go
this
one
is
topshelfeven
better
than
moonlights
death
and
taxes
world
class
beer
its
ridiculous
deserves
the
rating
it
has
d
a
nice
malty
beer
that
well
represents
the
style
one
of
my
favorites
from
sprecher
call
me
crazy
but
if
given
the
choice
id
take
a
sam
adams
black
lager
over
this
despite
this
having
that
exceptional
look
and
mouthfeel
mouthfeel
is
slick
silky
just
a
bit
creamy
very
light
tiny
bubbled
carbonation
provides
the
perfect
amount
of
tingle
drinkability
is
classdefining
delicious
balanced
and
mouthfeel
is
just
spot
on
truly
a
great
example
of
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
styles
o
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
as
far
as
schwarzs
go
this
is
on
my
menu
due
to
its
reasonable
price
and
freshness
from
across
the
wi
border
i
may
find
another
that
i
prefer
after
more
tastings
but
this
one
works
well
for
me
highly
recommended
best
schwarzbier
i
ever
had
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
drinkability
it
isnt
something
id
seek
out
but
its
adequately
drinkable
as
well
as
enjoyable
flavor
is
light
chocolate
and
some
very
mild
coffee
theres
some
light
roast
malt
there
as
well
in
addition
to
a
very
light
amount
of
caramel
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
without
all
that
much
carbonation
this
finish
is
moderately
dry
pretty
good
but
nothing
fantastic
definitely
not
a
mindaltering
schwarzbier
d
satisfactory
in
my
opinion
nothing
too
crazy
yet
not
bad
middle
of
the
road
brew
for
me
d
this
is
a
nice
schwarzbier
overall
its
a
bit
heavier
than
i
was
expecting
but
its
moderate
strength
was
a
nice
compliment
to
a
cold
autumn
day
taste
has
a
fruity
edge
to
it
that
doesnt
seem
to
fit
in
a
schwarzbier
style
profile
decent
roast
and
hop
bitterness
though
malts
are
abundant
but
not
as
sweet
and
full
as
i
would
like
a
little
more
robust
than
it
really
needs
to
be
and
i
get
a
bit
of
cooked
veggies
on
it
decent
enough
i
was
just
expecting
to
be
blown
away
by
it
i
like
kostritzer
and
monchoff
better
even
with
the
travel
across
the
big
pond
drinkability
its
a
good
schwarzbier
tweaked
with
less
than
traditional
ingredients
though
i
am
not
willing
to
say
it
is
a
great
one
beer
tastes
better
than
it
looks
and
smell
fortunately
its
sweet
at
leadoff
and
medium
bodied
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
an
ashy
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
finishes
a
little
dry
but
not
too
bad
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
my
favorite
schwartz
a
very
nice
beer
and
spot
on
for
the
style
a
good
all
around
beer
that
drinks
easily
medium
body
light
to
medium
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
super
good
example
of
the
style
maybe
the
best
us
sample
that
ive
tried
cheers
revisited
this
beer
on
tap
after
having
had
a
number
of
enjoyable
bottles
while
the
appearance
resembles
a
porter
in
color
it
is
actually
a
lager
and
tastes
as
such
hints
of
cocoa
but
not
as
drinkable
or
tasty
as
a
porter
in
fact
it
would
have
been
hard
to
distinguish
this
beer
from
say
a
decent
lager
in
a
blind
taste
test
well
you
could
taste
a
hint
of
roasting
but
not
much
still
a
decent
onceinawhile
beer
everything
is
great
about
this
beer
my
only
qualm
is
that
there
was
no
head
to
speak
of
and
in
a
black
beer
there
really
isnt
much
to
rate
it
on
besides
the
head
regardless
just
enough
roast
barley
to
give
that
roasty
toasty
taste
without
becoming
astringent
great
balance
between
specialty
grains
and
the
hops
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
6
either
finish
is
a
pleasant
light
coffee
bitter
nice
flavor
profile
save
this
one
and
its
a
nice
lighter
dark
beer
thats
pretty
drinkable
finish
is
a
pleasant
long
bitter
coffee
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
d
a
nice
alternative
for
porter
fans
very
smooth
and
not
as
filling
i
drank
this
beer
with
nothing
holding
me
back
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
top
5
beers
to
date
i
cant
think
of
anything
bad
about
this
beer
being
the
style
it
is
i
started
with
craft
beers
knowing
i
loved
black
beers
and
being
a
schwarzbier
is
just
that
if
you
havent
had
this
beer
take
some
time
and
get
to
know
it
i
really
do
think
this
beer
deserves
no
explanation
other
than
a
strong
push
in
the
go
get
this
beer
category
id
buy
this
one
again
you
get
three
fingers
of
dark
tan
foam
with
a
center
glass
pour
moderate
density
with
nice
retention
leaves
a
few
thick
streaks
of
lacing
pure
black
liquid
a
thin
aura
of
orange
at
the
rims
and
glass
bottom

deal
of
smokiness

recedes

enough
to

bitterness

hoppy
grassiness
and

play
well
with
the
resonant
smokiness

persists
a
nice
bonus
sufficient
sweetness
to
boost
drinkability
the
fruit
more
muted
and
indistinguishable
here
close
to
no
citrus
presence
hard
to
get
the
residue
out
of
your
mouth
takes
more
than
a
glass
of
water
drinkability
im
definitely
enjoying
this
one
and
finding
that
each
sip
follows
the
earlier
one
quite
naturally
and
easily
id
be
happy
to
have
a
second
one
and
its
a
certainty
that
ill
be
having
this
one
again
indeed
one
of
the
nice
things
about
this
beer
is
that
while
it
has
the
rich
complexity
that
is
so
nice
with
this
style
of
beer
it
does
not
have
the
intensity
or
in
your
face
character
that
some
stiyles
have
that
make
you
think
only
one
tonight
liked
this
beer
a
lot
sprecher
has
really
shot
up
in
my
book
lately
my
last
three
beers
by
them
have
blown
me
away
go
sprecher
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
cola
colored
head
that
retains
impressively
the
aroma
is
all
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
molasses
with
hints
of
pumpernickel
tobacco
smoke
and
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
similar
with
serious
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
initially
along
with
blackstrap
molasses
roastiness
smoke
earthy
hops
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
and
drinkability
is
good
but
limited
by
the
intense
roast
flavors
very
good
schwarzbier
a
little
more
intense
than
a
lot
of
the
domestic
versions
but
very
solid
nonetheless
all
of
the
big
flavor
of
a
stout
with
earier
drinkability
could
pass
as
a
porter

drinkability
excellent
schwarzbier
that
may
almost
have
too
much
flavor
to
be
as
easy
drinking
as
some
within
the
style
drinkability
overall
not
bad
wouldve
preferred
it
have
a
lighter
body
but
still
a
nice
option
for
summer
if
you
want
something
dark
and
rich
or
winter
if
you
want
something
with
great
roast
flavors
but
dont
want
another
heavy
stout
d
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
and
its
pretty
because
it
looks
like
a
stout
gorgeous
dmy
kind
of
lager
friggin
great
id
say
better
than
their
amber
and
pub
brown
very
happy
schwarzbiers
who
knew
i
might
start
buying
these
more
often
overall
although
not
huge
in
the
nose
and
taste
its
well
done
for
the
stlye
and
super
easy
to
drink
delicious
but
much
more
reminiscent
of
a
porter
than
a
schwarzbier
as
this
brew
possesses
nowhere
near
the
finesse
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
pleasing
in
itself
no
doubt
but
whereas
one
expects
pilslike
drinkability
from
a
schwarz
this
might
actually
fit
in
better
with
an
americanstyle
porter
or
even
a
baltic
porter
for
that
matter
it
is
a
good
try
for
an
american
company
but
there
are
a
few
german
examples
that
i
would
rather
have
id
drink
em
if
you
got
em
but
wouldnt
get
em
to
drink
em
o
if
it
had
a
richer
nose
itd
be
exceptional
still
plenty
of
nice
roasted
flavor
thats
in
balance
with
the
beer
i
like
the
touch
of
sweetness
that
makes
this
very
drinkable
d
good
from
start
to
finish
and
low
enough
abv
that
i
didnt
hesitate
to
order
another
d
by
far
the
best
schwarzbier
ive
come
across
perhaps
i
have
to
get
out
more
often
this
beer
is
perfect
for
its
style
you
need
some
time
to
put
back
this
16
oz
stubby
bottle
it
disperses
so
many
roasted
flavors
on
the
tongue
that
you
cant
stop
sipping
on
it
overall
a
solid
schwarzbier
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
even
during
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
sprecher
porter
like
in
flavor
initially
with
a
smooth
lager
finish
yet
one
that
never
gets
thin
in
body
notes
of
dark
cherry
and
coffee
abound
and
finishing
with
a
coarse
graininess
that
belies
the
style
a
bit
and
with
a
return
of
chocolate
on
the
close
feel
is
pleasant
and
rich
though
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
for
a
schwarzbier
which
limits
the
drink
a
bit
interesting
and
complex
tending
towards
an
ale
in
body
and
character
black
coffee
with
crimson
highlights
and
a
finger
of
whipped
mocha
foam
that
leaves
superfine
lacing
behind
on
the
glass
tootsie
roll
and
cocoa
are
heavy
duty
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
roastiness
as
well
rich
and
chocolatey
with
plenty
of
caramel
malt
and
a
perfect
hop
bittering
to
balance
full
bodied
for
a
lager
and
creamy
with
silky
smooth
carbonation
ill
admit
this
is
not
a
style
i
often
seek
out
but
black
bavarian
is
a
fantastic
schwarzbier
with
perfectly
balanced
complex
flavors
i
was
amazed
to
find
a
twist
off
top
underneath
a
wax
coated
cap
is
this
laziness
or
intentional
to
have
a
twist
off
under
wax
drinks
very
wellsessionable
with
the
best
of
its
style
this
isnt
a
very
strong
beer
and
i
hardly
felt
the
alcohol
when
i
was
drinking
it
sure
it
has
a
nice
mellow
roasted
feel
to
it
but
i
guess
that
a
germanstyle
beer
would
be
a
bit
more
bold
i
probably
need
to
try
out
more
from
this
style
since
the
range
is
probably
a
lot
greater
than
the
few
that
ive
had
would
indicate
this
would
certainly
fit
the
bill
for
a
sessionlike
winter
beer
for
the
novice
drinker
d
great
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
well
balanced
also
a
great
value
this
is
a
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
without
tiring
of
it
also
the
abv
is
low
compared
to
many
craft
offerings
another
bonus
for
me
in
this
category
d
being
a
fan
of
schwarzbiers
i
was
rather
disappointed
with
this
offering
given
many
of
the
reviews
ive
read
average
for
the
style
at
best
nothing
memorable
really
lacking
in
terms
of
complexities
in
all
facets
that
i
expect
from
top
notch
schwarzbiers
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
but
doesnt
devolve
into
something
i
dont
like
pretty
drinkable
not
too
challenging
enjoyable
and
reasonably
priced
an
interesting
combination
of
strong
burnt
and
light
malty
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
rich
but
my
the
carbonation
is
too
high
for
the
richness
and
distracts
from
the
taste
the
weird
thing
is
this
drinks
very
similar
to
810abv
ris
with
all
the
richness
but
is
less
than
6
usually
it
is
the
other
way
around
what
this
means
to
me
is
although
i
am
sipping
this
in
a
pace
similar
to
an
ris
i
was
able
to
have
three
16oz
bottles
in
one
night
without
feeling
full
or
drunk
which
was
a
huge
plus
this
was
fantastic
d
this
beer
is
good
not
great
but
good
i
wouldnt
mind
have
a
couple
pints
of
this
and
then
move
onto
something
a
little
more
less
heavy
feeling
i
could
drink
the
whole
four
pack
i
do
love
this
beer
and
it
makes
for
a
perfect
winter
sipper
glad
im
back
in
wi
where
they
have
this
on
tap
at
a
bunch
of
places
gotta
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
see
this
as
a
dark
session
beer
not
blown
away
but
would
make
for
a
good
start
of
the
night
beer
thanks
to
nappie
for
this
one
d
pretty
nice
example
of
the
style
here
a
dark
lager
with
a
somewhat
roasty
character
that
still
maintains
a
highly
quaffable
nature
that
you
dont
usually
find
in
darker
ales
a
good
one
for
getting
stout
and
porter
drinkers
to
come
around
to
lagers
or
vice
versa
d
very
good
not
thick
or
overwhelming
but
pleasant
flavorful
for
me
it
wasnt
enough
to
order
another
but
i
enjoyed
it
from
the
top
down
d
a
tasty
little
number
and
im
proud
it
is
locally
brewed
the
fact
that
it
is
locally
brewed
means
its
cheap
locally
which
adds
to
its
drinkability
it
certainly
doesnt
hurt
that
it
is
delicious
either
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
my
friends
rich
heavy
dark
lager
embodies
all
the
good
qualities
of
the
style
and
proof
a
beer
doesnt
require
heavy
amount
of
alcohol
to
be
complex
this
will
likely
be
my
goto
schwarzbier
as
moonlight
death
taxes
is
unavailable
outside
of
northern
california
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
black
lager
the
malt
is
rich
and
complex
so
much
so
that
it
is
almost
too
intense
for
the
style
bordering
on
being
a
schwarzbock
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
with
light
hops
but
enough
bitterness
to
keep
the
sweet
and
rich
malt
in
check
had
this
beer
from
a
16
oz
bottle
tonight
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
good
off
white
head
the
bottle
says
that
the
beer
has
a
very
good
malt
back
bone
and
it
is
right
on
in
saying
so
never
have
i
had
such
a
full
bodied
lager
amazingly
tastes
of
caramel
and
malt
an
overall
fantastic
beer
so
tasty
and
amazingly
drinkable
my
new
favorite
german
style
beer
decent
brew
i
like
it
not
great
for
me
my
mouth
feels
like
i
just
took
a
shot
of
jager
and
in
that
case
i
wish
i
would
have
just
taken
a
shot
of
jager
purchased
from
the
sprecher
brewery
giftshop
in
glendale
wi
pours
a
pitch
black
body
with
a
thick
tan
head
aroma
of
toffee
chocolate
and
roasted
peat
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
a
blast
of
roasted
malt
in
your
mouth
with
a
touch
of
smokiness
mild
carbonation
gives
it
a
silky
mouthfeel
pleasant
sweetness
in
the
finish
this
is
what
a
dark
lager
should
be
terrific
beer
average
drinkability
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
given
another
chance
i
probably
would
have
ventured
elsewhere
on
the
menu
drink
this
is
a
tasty
black
brew
but
just
a
pint
will
do
enjoy
the
rich
flavors
slowly
d
with
the
style
in
mind
this
is
a
great
beer
i
could
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
poured
from
the
usual
sprecher
big
bulbous
16oz
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
smell
of
thick
sweet
molasses
out
of
the
bottle
pours
a
black
that
on
closer
inspection
in
the
light
is
actually
a
very
deep
dark
cherry
red
with
about
two
inches
of
cherrytinted
foam
the
foam
recedes
without
leaving
any
lace
the
taste
delivers
on
the
scent
the
main
character
is
sweet
caramelized
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
bite
to
it
it
does
have
a
slight
charred
aftertaste
im
not
fond
of
while
the
ba
description
of
a
schwarzbier
suggests
theyre
often
light
in
flavor
this
one
resembles
a
porter
more
than
anything
else
my
favorite
wisconsin
dark
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
bite
on
the
tongue
big
warming
bready
flavor
is
all
over
this
beer
subtle
chocolate
notes
mixed
with
fresh
butteredbread
and
light
coffee
flavor
makes
this
a
wonderful
drink
there
is
so
much
depth
to
this
lager
i
could
drink
this
all
night
absolutely
wonderful
i
give
this
high
marks
for
drinkability
might
be
a
little
fuller
of
flavor
than
most
schwarzbiers
but
not
cloying
or
heavy
by
any
means
still
keeps
the
lighthearted
nature
of
the
style
d
my
personal
favorite
schwarzbier
easy
to
enjoy
balanced
and
goes
down
smooth
it
is
simple
but
rewarding
even
better
fresh
the
smell
certainly
waned
due
to
its
age
d
pretty
full
and
filling
great
malt
flavors
and
low
abvs
make
this
a
drinker
drinkability
i
could
do
a
session
with
this
but
probably
not
now
in
the
summer
more
of
a
fall
or
winter
beer
its
definitely
got
a
unique
taste
i
could
see
myself
craving
at
some
time
i
love
rye
bread
and
rye
flavors
so
i
will
be
having
this
again
thanks
to
my
in
laws
from
bringing
me
cases
from

every
time
they
visit
sprecher
black
bavarian
is
a
solid
black
lager
with
a
fluffy
brown
head
wooden
spice
sweet
malt
and
roast
are
in
the
aroma
its
mediumfull
bodied
and
incredibly
smooth
with
a
slightly
astringent
finish
big
chewy
roasted
malt
is
the
flavor
here
its
balanced
bold
and
simple
the
wooden
spice
is
in
the
taste
too
its
almost
a
touch
tart
this
is
very
enjoyable
a
supreme
lager
black
in
color
with
light
mocha
head
that
quickly
dissipates
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
clean
attack
that
gives
way
to
a
heavy
flavor
of
lightly
roasted
malts
if
that
isnt
contradictory
sweet
towards
the
finish
but
still
finishes
as
clean
as
it
starts
there
is
a
mild
smokiness
to
the
aftertaste
and
it
leaves
just
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
must
say
that
this
is
for
sure
my
favorite
of
the
sprecher
beers
that
i
have
tried
a
stubby
16
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
light
ecru
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
dark
roasted
grains
mild
coffee
and
chocolate
caramel
earthy
bitter
hops
falls
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
for
a
schwarzbier
and
is
amply
carbonated
as
well
certainly
worth
your
time
drinkability
well
this
is
just
a
wonderful
beer
will
definitely
search
out
more
in
this
style
very
drinkable
dark
lager
although
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
session
because
of
the
sweetness
d
i
only
rated
it
average
i
was
very
gungho
about
drinking
it
at
first
but
the
sweet
flavor
just
kept
building
up
in
my
palate
to
the
point
where
i
couldnt
finish
it
if
you
sip
it
slow
its
a
great
beer
dont
go
overboard
the
malt
has
definite
sweetness
and
a
little
coffee
bitterness
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
dark
taste
but
is
appropriately
mediumbodied
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
or
hops
and
i
like
it
that
way
its
creamy
actually
not
thin
and
goes
down
very
well
note
to
self
ranked
1
schwarzbier
when
i
tried
it
16oz
pours
near
black
with
some
ruby
and
chestnut
hues
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
when
held
to
the
light
foamy
tan
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
and
leaves
nearly
no
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
mainly
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
bittersweet
chocolate
tastes
are
again
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
also
espresso
finishes
slightly
bitter
and
dry
but
very
crisp
love
this
style
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
for
a
great
price
paid
5
69
for
a
4pack
of
pint
bottles
pours
a
pretty
dark
brown
that
shows
light
sizeable
tannish
head
mild
nose
flavor
is
bringing
a
lot
of
flavor
nice
malts
noticeable
cooked
but
not
roasted
grain
tones
the
malts
really
seem
to
thicken
up
to
me
as
time
goes
on
mildly
sweet
as
a
compliment
to
everything
else
feel
has
a
nipping
carbonation
liquid
is
slightly
thick
its
a
shame
that
sprecher
isnt
more
widely
distributed
here
as
far
as
variety
goes
id
be
very
open
to
trying
anything
they
brewed
this
brew
pours
up
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
quickly
fading
tan
head
the
nose
smells
like
an
ale
chocolate
malts
and
subtle
caramel
the
taste
is
toasted
malts
chocolate
subtle
sweetness
very
crisp
medium
bodied
and
low
to
medium
carbo
drinkability
high
i
guess
nothing
is
bad
about
this
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
its
great
on
tap
if
you
can
get
it
nothing
i
would
seek
out
on
a
consistant
basis
d
this
has
been
at
my
local
liquor
store
since
i
began
shopping
there
over
a
year
ago
i
always
passed
it
up
recently
i
read
the
reviews
on
this
one
and
thought
at
5
99
for
a
4pk16
oz
i
am
silly
for
having
passed
on
this
on
so
often
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
as
it
has
a
great
deal
of
complexity
i
really
like
the
smokiness
of
it
also
not
too
much
but
a
good
amount
d
overall
very
good
for
the
style
at
6
if
schwarzbier
is
your
thing
black
bavarian
is
sessionalbe
will
be
having
this
again
skal
drinkability
easy
to
drink
very
good
overall
a
very
smooth
beer
that
covers
a
lot
of
bases
body
is
medium
but
can
feel
thicker
and
thinner
at
times
weird
i
guess
thats
the
beauty
of
a
schwarzbier
big
bold
malt
flavor
packed
into
a
lager
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
recommended
perhaps
it
will
be
a
bit
better
as
the
beer
warms
as
i
think
i
have
my
beer
fridge
running
too
cold
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
have
had
another
one
but
decided
to
try
something
else
good
job
overall
a
wellcrafted
beer
that
pushes
the
schwarzbier
flavor
envelope
without
shredding
it
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
just
misses
being
a
great
beer
for
me
needs
a
little
more
bitter
to
balance
the
sweetness
since
no
date
on
bottle
cant
tell
how
fresh
it
is
so
would
like
to
try
at
least
one
more
to
validate
the
review
its
not
available
here
in
texas
but
if
it
was
it
would
make
it
into
the
rotation
as
changeupsemiregular
in
the
session
mix
do
recommend
but
dont
go
too
far
out
the
way
d
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
its
pretty
filling
for
what
i
consider
to
be
a
pretty
low
abv
brew
good

the
expected

then
leaves
some
fine
splattered
lace

is
of
a
chocolate
milkshake
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
lightly
roasted
malts
pleasant
enough
stuff
notes
of
more
light
chocolate
and
cafe
au
lait
allowed
to
warm
up
this
one
shows
some
moderate
complexity
and
more
nice
soft
chocolate
notes
nice
beer
worth
trying
especially
for
dark
lager
fans
overall
it
was
very
drinkable
and
and
great
tasting
if
i
find
this
in
store
ill
pick
up
a
pack
for
sure
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
would
have
to
recommend
this
one
pours
a
dark
cola
like
color
with
an
average
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
light

the
aroma
is

characteristics
the
taste
is
of
stale
coffee
semisweet
chocolate
light
caramel
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
burnt
wood
some
nice
flavors
for
a
lager
the
brew
has
a
moderate
to
chewy
body
yet
retains
the
crisp
lager
trait
prickly
carbonation
the
finish
is
sweet
an
enjoyable

very
drinkable
da
highly
drinkable
brew
smooth
from
start

easy
to
drink
and
still
a
highquality
and
flavorful
beer
d
i
could
sit
back
with
these
all
night
except
that
i
have
a
plane
to
catch
in
the
morning
dquite
good
d
a
good
session
brew
something
i
could
have
about
two
of
before
wanting
to
switch
to
something
else
pretty
good
bargain
as
well
definitely
a
soild
dark
brew
pours
very
dark
brown
im
picking
up
a
bit
of
a
smokiness
in
the
nose
but
its
mostly
just
malt
complexity
the
same
follows
after
the
first
sip
rich
slightly
sweet
complex
malts
very
fulltasting
and
again
with
a
slight
smokiness
some
toasted
and
nutty
flavors
as
well
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
honestly
i
wasnt
expecting
to
i
like
the
16oz
serving
and
its
a
twist
off
it
paired
nicely
with
some
aged
gouda
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
the
thin
body
makes
it
just
slide
down
light
to
medium
body
good
carbonation
easy
to
drink
a
good
ol
mil
town
brew
i
have
no
experience
with
schwarzbiers
but
if
this
is
any
indication
of
how
they
should
taste
i
really
like
them
and
want
to
try
some
more
the
beer
is
black
laced
with
hints
of
amber
nested
on
top
is
a
creamy
tan
head
that
does
not
leave
much
lace
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
toffee
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
full
of
smooth
chocolate
toffee
and
amber
the
beer
is
mediumfull
bodied
slightly
less
than
your
average
porter
with
an
incredible
creaminess
and
smooth
carbonation
overall
a
great
schwarzbier
very
nice
downright
tasty
great
schwarzbier
drinkability
is
good
goes
down
easy
nice
to
have
two
in
a
row
not
the
best
schwarz
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
comment
had
this
from
a
sample
pack
and
wish
the
8
pack
was
4
of
these
and
4
of
the
special
amber
two
very
good
beers
that
ill
get
again
the
taste
did
not
disappoint
either
i
was
a
little
surprised
on
the
backend
hop
flavor
that
i
got
but
the
bittering
overall
worked
well
following
in
kind
with
the
nose
my
first
impression
was
a
toasted
dark
chocolate
bread
with
a
burnt
caramel
topping
is
it
lunch
time
yet
i
did
not
pick
up
much
of
a
metallic
taste
as
other
reviewers
noted
fine
by
me
overall
this
was
extremely
smooth
and
relaxing
perfect
for
a
crisp
sunny
autumn
dayearly
evening
i
will
absolutely
be
seeking
this
out
again
and
again
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
i
dont
usually
see
this
around
but
if
i
do
i
might
have
to
get
some
more
of
it
opaque
black
body
with
a
soapbubblelike
tan
head
smell
is
sharp
and
chocolaty
taste
is
smooth
sweet
but
finishes
with
a
bit
of
tartness
nice
balancing
act
between
the
malt
and
hops
theres
not
much
to
dislike
about
this
beer
other
than
my
taste
buds
cant
handle
a
lot
of
sweetness
in
one
sitting
drinkability
huge
incredible
as
quaffable
as
a
cold
iced
tea
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
does
not
beg
another
sip
it
seductively
demands
one
velvet
smooth
a
great
beer
that
ranks
up
there
with
köstritzer
the
east
german
classic
that
rules
the
roost
t
medium
body
with
very
strong
carbonation
starts
with
a
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
and
finishes
slightly
more
acidic
but
still
sweet
in
between
toasted
coffee
flavors
persist
very
creamy
and
smooth
despite
slight
bitterness
and
acidity
lingering
roasted
malt
flavor
very
good
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
very
drinkable
d
a
really
nice
lager
from
sprecher
perfect
with
bratwurst
i
would
imagine
easy
drinking
despite
its
dark
flavors
and
appearance
i
get
a
little
bit
of
beef
jerky
well
maybe
not
beef
jerkey
maybe
soy
sauce
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
held
to
the
light
is
slightly
opaque
nice
light
brown
head
leaving
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
deep
aroma
with
hints
of
finely
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
bold
but
smooth
chocolate
malts
with
roasted
caramel
hit
the
palate
with
nice
balance
and
a
smooth
taste
this
is
a
nice
brew
near
my
home
town
in
milwaukee
drink
up
the
balance
leaves
you
with
a
beer
thats
at
once
complex
and
hugely
drinkable
starts
out
with
very
ripe
fruit
super
sweet
and
balancing
that
out
you
have
a
more
mundane
caramely
sweetness
this
then
falls
back
into
a
more
traditionally
schwarzy
middle
of
dark
roasted
chocolate
malt
earthen
and
bitter
the
end
is
dry
and
bitter
the
sweet
malts
coat
my
mouth
yet
this
is
a
pretty
crisp
brew
this
is
a
very
flavorful
lager
although
not
my
favorite
style
id
recommend
trying
this
one
this
was
just
a
really
good
lightly
roasted
black
lager
i
pictured
being
able
to
drink
this
in
a
half
liter
mug
in
autumn
and
i
think
it
would
be
perfect
for
that
light
enough
in
alcohol
and
body
to
be
able
to
quaff
yet
high
enough
in
flavor
to
enjoy
thoroughly
i
love
how
the
mild
roastiness
and
semisweetness
of
the
malts
comes
out
over
the
fairly
light
body
really
good
sprecher
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
especially
since
they
make
the
best
root
beer
ever
but
i
digress
very
nice
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
pounders
if
the
price
was
right
a
case
seems
nice
for
a
warm
afternoon
with
friends
pours
a
virtually
opaque
very
dark
brown
which
looks
black
when
its
not
held
up
to
the
light
small
tan
head
doesnt
last
long
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
nose
i
mean
it
smells
like
beer
but
thats
about
it
i
cant
detect
a
whole
lot
in
the
smell
the
nose
is
misleading
though
because
the
taste
is
pretty
huge
i
taste
caramel
as
well
as
a
roasted
smoky
taste
this
is
an
excellent
schwarzbier
not
quite
as
smooth
as
some
of
the
others
ive
had
but
excellent
nonetheless
the
flavor
is
impressive
with
lots
of
roasted
malts
going
on
coffee
with
sweetness
in
the
middle
and
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
even
if
it
is
not
as
smooth
as
typical
schwarzbiers
reminded
me
of
a
lighter
rauchbier
more
than
a
schwarzbier
poured
thick
dark
brownblack
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
tan
brown
head
that
only
reached
about
34
of
an
inch
high
and
didnt
last
long
smelled
great
bread
toffee
and
lightly
meaty
the
taste
however
integrated
some
light
flavors
of
rauchbier
with
a
smokiness
and
some
jerky
flavors
and
sliiight
coffee
but
accompanied
by
some
sweeter
malt
this
is
a
good
beer
to
bridge
the
gap
to
a
more
flavorful
in
your
face
rauchbier
or
stout
other
black
beers
ive
had
were
a
bit
sweeter
and
subtle
this
has
a
bit
more
taste
and
is
restorative
drinkability
very
nice
beer
1
for
this
style
i
can
see
why
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
schwarzbier
with
plenty
of
roasted
goodness
to
enjoy
overall
a
very
good
brew
not
the
most
drinkable
i
cant
see
having
more
than
one
or
two
in
one
sitting
but
on
a
bottlebybottle
basis
a
nice
drinker
d
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
this
is
so
smoky
that
its
almost
like
a
rauchbier
i
would
definitely
pick
up
some
more
of
this
great
brew
nice
one
sprecher
i
vividly
remember
first
trying
sprecher
black
bavarian
it
took
one
sip
for
me
to
deem
it
the
best
schwarzbier
i
had
tried
to
date
admittedly
i
didnt
know
much
about
the
style
back
then
but
having
gained
a
lot
more
experience
since
i
still
think
its
probably
one
of
the
best
there
is
the
pour
is
a
clear
dark
brown
color
but
in
the
glass
the
its
too
dark
to
see
through
this
one
has
a
shallow
wispy
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
without
leaving
much
belgian
lacing
warning
im
not
a
big
fan
that
this
is
a
twist
off
cap
i
dont
trustem
the
smell
is
unique
the
aroma
isnt
completely
roasted
but
its
earthy
and
maltlike
with
a
musty
sort
of
character
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
there
is
a
tangy
hop
to
it
but
im
a
little
distracted
that
the
earthy
musty
thing
has
carried
into
the
flavor
full
flavored
the
taste
isnt
chaulky
but
its
quite
earthy
theres
some
chocolate
malt
and
something
that
id
loosely
characterize
as
caramelized
this
one
is
not
getting
it
for
me
feel
free
pour
a
person
has
to
know
there
limitations
looks
pretty
black
with
a
tan
head
that
shrinks
up
slowly
to
a
lace
the
aroma
lives
up
to
the
dark
malts
the
appearance
promises
chocolatey
roasted
goodness
the
malts
live
on
in
the
taste
with
a
good
bit
of
roastedness
its
well
attenuated
with
a
fine
crisp
mouthfeel
a
pretty
good
beer
easy
enough
to
drink
but
by
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
was
about
dome
with
this
one
well
it
was
the
fourth
pint
that
night
d
a
great
quaffer
for
a
hot
day
i
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
specher
and
black
bavarian
delivers
on
those
and
i
think
i
picked
the
perfect
day
for
it
this
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
really
a
great
beer
part
of
a
sampler
pack
from
my
visit
to
illinois
so
i
dont
know
if
i
will
ever
try
it
again
overall
a
stellar
beer
ive
had
one
other
schwartzbeer
but
i
dont
really
remember
it
this
beer
is
definitely
memorable
and
is
a
worthy
adversary
to
any
porter
out
there
the
great
thing
about
this
brew
is
that
it
is
so
damn
easy
to
drink
goodbye
4pack
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
lighter
it
has
toasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
licorice
other
elements
of
flowers
and
spice
a
tad
like
a
little
good
root
beer
it
has
a
nice
sweetbitter
balance
the
flavour
is
strong
and
lasting
but
incredibly
smooth
despite
appearances
it
is
actually
lightly
carbonated
and
has
a
lively
yet
creamy
feel
and
is
highly
drinkable
bill
is
the
man
16oz
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
roasted
malts
molasses
toffee
and
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
is
dark
and
roasty
with
a
good
dose
of
slightly
burnt
malts
caramel
and
a
touch
of
smoke
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
overall
black
bavarian
is
a
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
and
will
purchase
again
in
the
future
recommended
very
nice
to
drink
i
wish
we
could
get
more
of
this
around
here
drinkability
is
average
this
is
a
heavy
beer
that
for
its
weight
is
lacking
in
complexity
for
its
weight
on
the
mouth
sooo
drinkable
black
yet
crisp
and
refreshing
the
perfect
brew
very
well
done
d
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
schwarzbier
but
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
the
body
is
creamy
and
lightly
carbonated
a
nice
smooth
texture
overall
this
a
great
example
of
a
schwartz
this
one
came
highly
recommended
huh
a
screwoff
top
w
no
date
pours
a
deep
garnet
brown
w
a
thin
tan
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
behind
in
my
nonic
a
sour
roasted
malt
smell
similar
to
an
imp
stout

coffee
floralpiney
hop
notes
throughout
a
rich
burnttoast
coffee
flavor
initially
w
some
piney
hop
as
well
followed
by
dark
fruit
dates
and
roasted
nuts
a
smokey
slightly
metallic
note
to
the
finish
surprisingly
light
for
a
beer
this
rich
the
co2
makes
this
a
creamy
delight
an
excellent
brew
not
just
for
a
schwartz
but
in
general
a
must
try
for
sure
pours
a
nice
dark
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tannish
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
very
nice
tones
of
toffeechocolatecaramel
the
taste
is

drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
schwarzbier
wow
i
absolutely
love
schwarzbiers
and
this
was
definitley
one
of
the
best
ive
had
just
a
fantastic
roasty
feel
that
is
perfectly
balanced
by
its
complimentary
sweetness
characteristics
this
was
my
first
beer
from
sprecher
and
the
great
flavor
and
big
drinkibility
of
this
guy
have
left
a
favorable
first
impression

good
stuff
d
a
good
black
lager
but
not
a
style
im
generally
a
fan
of
dseriously
this
is
some
great
stuff
i
was
skeptical
at
first
but
upon
the
first
sip
i
was
hooked
i
have
had
quite
a
few
german
schwarzbiers
and
while
they
are
one
of
my
favorite
lager
styles
i
have
had
none
that
have
this
much
flavour
well
done
sprecher
overall
a
very
tasty
schwarzbier
and
representative
of
the
style
this
beer
came
with
a
really
nice
head
and
lasting
lace
the
mouthfeel
was
incredibly
smooth
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
not
too
bad
all
around
but
something
like
this
id
expect
to
be
a
bit
more
smooth
d
this
is
a
very
good
schwarzbier
i
would
suggest
trying
the
same
easy
to
drink
good
taste
and
overall
a
highquality
bier
my
first
review
of
a
schwarzbier
i
really
like
the
style
and
plan
on
seeking
out
more
mediumbodied
and
with
moderate
levels
of
carbonation
smooth
but
just
a
bit
sticky
i
remember
having
this
on
tap
a
few
weeks
back
and
wasnt
impressed
i
am
glad
the
bottled
version
is
much
better
d
smooth
tasty
not
terribly
complicated
low
abv
well
done
appears
a
nearly
black
ruby
tinted
mahogany
brown
hue
forms
a
nice
thicket
of
tan
head
textured
with
dimples
as
it
dwindles
definitely
arose
above
the
rim
of
my
12
liter
mug
lacing
is
fine
and
intricate
spread
evenly
very
nice
look
to
it
aromatics
nutty
roasted
qualities
touch
of
dark
cocoa
powder
with
sweet
acidic
fruit
notes
arising
as
well
flavor
is
akin
to
iced
black
coffee
with
dark
chocolate
roasts
toasted
nuts
and
a
touch
of
creamy
caramel
what
dominates
is
a
dry
powdered
dark
cocoa
but
more
flavors
arise
as
it
warms
up
light
herbal
hop
presence
felt
at
the
end
but
no
hop
burps
to
report
mouthfeel

medium
bodied
carbonation
is
lively
and
the
end
is
dry
with
slightly
burnt
coffee
roasts
and
dark
chocolate
cocoa
drinkability
is
nice
all
around
one
of
the
best
schwarzbiers
ive
come
across
excellent
ive
been
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
sprechers
wares
and
black
bavarian
will
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
again
soon
very
good
d
excellent
schwartsbier
dark
malts
with
subtle
sweet
and
smokey
flavors
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
goes
down
easy
a
great
session
beer
may
the
shwarz
be
with
you
i
wish
i
had
more
access
to
this
as
i
would
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
the
black
bavarian
has
a
chocolate
dark
in
color
beer
body
with
a
tan
in
color
foamed
head
a
malt
flavored
beer
of
caramel
and
chocolate
it
is
a
very
smooth
and
warming
beer
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
this
beer
again
and
would
recommend
it
in
the
future
nice
dark
almost
black
body
with
a
rather
thin
whitish
head
aroma
is
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
and
noble
hops
in
there
overall
its
just
a
really
fresh
malt
aroma
taste
is
also
clean
and
a
bit
malty
a
nice
hop
balance
in
there
but
not
much
hop
flavor
just
bittering
mouthfeel
is
solid
better
than
average
not
exactly
memorable
drinkability
is
very
good
i
really
wish
this
beer
was
available
near
where
i
live
while
not
the
amzing
revalation
i
was
hoping
for
it
would
be
a
staple
lager
for
me
to
complement
my
occasional
prima
pils
and
paulaner
ofests
drinkability
was
good
easy
to
drink
but
i
had
better
in
germany
but
not
bad
for
an
american
schwarz
i
have
only
had
a
couple
of
schwarzbiers
but
this
is
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
very
good
example
of
the
style
better
yet
its
brewed
less
than
15
minutes
from
my
house
pours
a
clear
dark
red
almost
black
hard
to
see
through
big
thick
tan
head
forms
drops
down
leaving
lots
of
lace
solid
layer
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
some
anise
caramel
touch
of
chocolate
iron
cherries
bit
of
maple
not
bad
taste
is
nice
iron
caramel
light
roast
fruits
rich
chocolate
in
the
finish
some
licorice
and
solid
roasty
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
smooth
solid
shwarzbier
best
sprecher
ive
had
d
smooth
and
a
pleasure
going
down
by
far
the
best
schwarzbier
i
have
ever
had
sprecher
has
truly
made
a
classic
highly
recommended
this
brew
pours
a
opaque
black
color
the
head
in
one
inch
in
height
light
tan
in
color
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
chocolate
and
toffee
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
a
little
more
caramel
and
a
little
less
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
authentic
german
style
beer
i
have
had
in
america
it
brings
back
found
memories
of
some
of
the
great
beers
i
had
while
i
lived
in
germany
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
the
malt
is
definately
on
display
here
hints
of
bitter
chocolate
and
espresso
add
to
the
complexity
i
dont
sense
much
for
hops
in
aroma
or
taste
which
i
think
would
add
to
the
beer
as
it
is
very
sweet
it
feels
heavy
for
a
schwarzbier
sprecher
calls
it
kulmbacher
but
has
a
excellant
creamy
smooth
feel
just
mild
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
feels
a
little
heavy
as
i
think
it
could
be
confused
for
a
stout
so
it
doesnt
have
the
consumption
rate
of
other
black
lagers
and
their
drinking
appeal
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
decent
kick
excellent
representation
of
style
to
quote
respected
fellow
ba
intriqken
now
this
is
a
schwarzbier
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
could
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
and
was
certainly
worth
the
wait
the
only
thing
that
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
is
that
i
havent
been
able
to
find
it
in
my
area
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
that
seems
to
stick
around
for
a
bit
stickiness
could
use
some
help
but
there
is
some
smell
is
a
sweet
molasses
with
some
caramel
malt
and
leather
some
roasted
barley
as
well
as
a
tiny
bitterness
in
the
nose
taste
has
some
toasted
malt
and
a
sweet
brown
sugar
i
detect
a
hint
of
coffeeespresso
as
well
but
not
overpowering
at
all
aftertaste
has
a
bit
of
a
hop
tingle
to
it
as
well
as
a
hit
of
tobacco
mouthfeel
is
rich
creamy
and
full
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
i
was
quite
surprised
nice
to
have
a
beer
like
this
every
now
and
then
to
take
me
away
from
my
everyday
ipa
lifestyle
d
a
solid
lager
an
extremely
flavorful
schwarzbier
almost
with
porter
like
characteristics
almost
completely
opaque
black
body
slight
brown
hues
when
held
to
the
light
small
brown
head
tops
it
off
big
chocholate
malt
scent
some
slight
roast
to
it
the
main
gist
of
this
one
is
chocolate
malts
good
amount
of
roast
to
them
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
in
the
backround
big
creamy
mouth
not
a
bad
drink
dthis
is
a
good
swartzbier
but
not
on
par
with
some
of
the
european
classics
is
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
but
this
is
a
good
one
to
have
on
hand
drinkability
big
pimping
brew
here
folks
this
is
a
musttry
and
a
gem
from
the
midwest
its
definetly
turned
me
on
to
more
dark
lagers
and
i
look
forward
to
more
like
this
bad
boy
though
sadly
i
only
have
one
more
of
him
overall
i
really
liked
this
brew
i
still
prefer
my
stouts
and
porters
but
that
is
not
to
slight
this
one
in
any
way
it
drinks
like
a
porter
or
stout
but
is
lighter
in
body
the
taste
is
in
the
same
ball
park
but
this
one
is
a
little
more
flat
than
most
all
that
being
said
you
have
to
remember
this
beer
is
a
lager
impressive
i
dont
generally
like
lagers
sprecher
made
a
great
beer
here
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
i
am
not
real
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
plan
to
go
in
search
of
others
d
was
a
little
bitter
on
the
back
end
but
maybe
thats
because
i
was
eating
pickels
before
trying
this
beer
very
tasty
and
drinkable
dark
beer
fits
well
any
time
of
year
drinkability
is
excellent
drinkability
bold
flavors
make
up
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
this
bottle
was
consumed
quite
quickly
and
too
bad
there
wasnt
another
one
around
16
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
an
inch
and
half
frothy
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
smells
very
malty
like
coffee
chocolate
and
molasses
its
very
tasty
it
tastes
like
chocolate
roasted
malt
caramel
molasses
coffee
and
also
a
bit
of
a
smoky
taste
for
the
most
part
its
a
sweet
tasting
beer
with
some
bitterness
too
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
its
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
and
slick
with
a
dry
finish
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
its
hard
to
stop
drinking
this
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
and
id
definitely
recommend
it
very
nicely
done
enjoyed
it
tremendously
beer
pours
a
jet
clack
with
an
ok
tan
head
nose
is
of
roasted
malts
taste
initially
was
a
blast
of
those
roasted
malts
later
sips
produce
notes
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
molasses
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
as
this
glides
very
nicely
across
my
palate
drinkability
is
near
perfect
this
is
one
solid
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
put
into
my
rotation
a
mediumfull
body
with
a
nice
smooth
aftertaste
that
just
slowly
fades
away
i
could
find
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
at
all
extremely
good
great
even
try
two
or
three
drinks
very
easy
a
pretty
damn
good
schwartz
the
equal
of
anything
i
had
in
germany
shame
about
the
visual
might
adjust
this
if
i
see
better
results
next
time
yet
to
taste
a
loser
tasty
overall
deffinatly
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
got
this
as
part
of
sprechers
beers
of
old
bavaria
very
tasty
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
baltic
porter
and
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
when
its
mellow
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
and
the
taste
is
bland
at
first
but
then
it
explodes
with
rich
chocolate
theres
a
roasted
edge
to
it
thats
more
barley
than
coffee
but
quite
nice
theres
a
decent
bitterness
and
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
schwarzbier
by
taste
but
its
quite
good
regardless
worth
finding
overall
this
is
a
great
schwarzbier
definitely
one
of
sprechers
better
brews
try
it
in
a
snifter
the
scent
of
this
one
is
wonderful
this
beer
is
a
decent
beer
to
make
a
session
out
of
but
there
are
better
schwarzbiers
out
there
im
glad
i
tried
it
though
i
would
definetly
order
it
at
a
bar
highly
recommended
one
of
my
favorite
schwarzbiers
and
from
sprecher
no
less
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
an
attractive
amount
of
durable
head
aroma
a
light
roasty
flavor
is
very
roasty
lots
of
burned
pizza
crust
balanced
with
a
bit
of
sourness
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
smooth
unlike
most
of
its
sprecher
brothers
and
sisters
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
had
i
been
staying
at
scott
street
for
more
than
one
beer
i
most
certainly
would
have
indulged
in
a
few
more
drafts
of
this
fine
beer
i
look
forward
to
my
next
trip
to
wausau
so
i
can
stop
in
and
have
another
if
you
get
the
chance
dont
pass
on
the
this
one
drinkability
is
very
good
might
be
a
little
heavy
and
earthy
for
some
but
its
bread
butter
here
very
enjoyable
black
but
slightly
red
this
beer
smells
like
goodness
roasted
malt
a
little
coffee
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
right
now
it
is
super
drinkable
and
it
can
sit
it
my
mouth
before
it
goes
down
smooth
and
awesome
it
has
a
bitter
taste
but
it
is
still
sweet
and
rich
it
has
a
burnt
caramel
aftertaste
that
leaves
my
lips
smackin
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
and
you
like
porters
youve
got
to
try
this
one
poured
near
black
with
mahogany
highlights
12
an
inch
of
light
brown
foam
dissipated
quickly
smelled
crazy
malty
roasted
sweet
even
a
little
burnt
but
not
much
else
in
the
nose
some
complexity
came
out
in
the
taste
the
roasted
malts
diverged
into
the
sweets
and
a
prominent
nuttiness
hazelnut
before
a
bitter
slightly
sour
finish
i
think
it
sounds
better
than
it
tasted
because
the
nut
flavor
was
too
big
for
all
of
these
other
subtler
things
to
come
out
pretty
big
mouthfeel
and
it
went
down
easy
enough
but
i
didnt
want
another
as
opposed
to
kolstrizer
which
has
gotten
lesser
reviews
but
i
can
down
all
night
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
porters
or
lighter
stouts
try
this
one
out
d
complex
and
tasty
though
that
stale
flavor
felt
off
and
carbonation
felt
awkwardly
flat
at
times
enjoyable
and
drinkable
worth
a
shot
id
have
another
another
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
porter
this
ones
a
lager
so
points
for
originality
reasonably
priced
and
tasty
to
boot
good
stuff
one
solid
lager
bold
and
with
good
complexity
and
a
round
full
mouth
again
very
clean
and
refreshing
moderate
carbonation
and
the
ability
too
session
for
well
a
good
long
session
toffee
from
the
nose
is
leaning
more
toward
caramel
and
a
slight
floral
hop
bitterness
helps
round
out
the
finish
once
in
the
mouth
this
schwarzbier
opens
up
full
throttle
running
straight
up
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
exploding
with
malts
coffee
and
sweet
spice
all
gently
falling
back
on
to
the
tongue
wrapping
around
the
sides
of
your
mouth
then
drying
out
and
disappearing
leaving
only
a
desire
for
another
sip
overall
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
and
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
i
love
the
16
oz
bottle
as
well
this
one
is
a
staple
for
me
drinkability
do
you
enjoy
refreshing
flavorful
light
beers
if
you
do
then
you
should
pick
up
or
trade
for
this
one
would
i
drink
it
again
i
sure
wouldnt
mid
another
one
if
im
ever
in
the
mood
for
a
light
flavorful
dark
beer
then
im
going
to
definitely
going
to
pick
up
a
more
bang
for
your
buck
16
oz
pint
bottle
of
sprechers
black
bavarian
cheers
i
was
somewhat
full
after
2
of
these
maybe
it
was
just
me
not
the
beer
this
beer
pours
a
nice
head
that
doesnt
dissapate
easily
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
behind
its
black
and
beautiful
the
smell
is
coffee
roasted
malts
that
are
great
the
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
but
not
overly
bitter
with
coffee
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
overall
this
is
my
favorite
lager
to
date
so
i
will
be
having
more
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
and
i
am
quite
happy
that
it
came
in
a
16oz
package
as
it
is
the
perfect
beer
to
have
more
than
twelve
ounces
of
perhaps
a
touch
to
hard
with
the
acidity
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
enjoyable
all
the
same
before
i
know
it
this
beer
is
gone
so
i
must
have
liked
it
pours
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
34
head
that
disappates
firly
quickly
could
be
bar
glasses
cleaning
that
makes
the
head
disappear
which
always
makes
it
hard
t
judge
beer
in
bars
the
aroma
is
coffee
chocolate
taste
is
smoky
black
malt
but
not
overpowering
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
schwarzbier
i
would
like
to
try
a
bottle
to
see
if
the
appearence
and
head
is
different
d
my
favorite
sprecher
beer
and
possibly
one
of
the
best
schwarzbiers
i
have
had
d
seems
more
like
a
porter
than
a
schwarz
but
its
good
enough
that
i
dont
really
care
this
is
an
extraordinarily
pleasant
beer
it
pours
a
midnight
black
with
a
very
slight
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
a
sprecher
trait
perhaps
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
just
about
righta
yeasty
malt
that
hints
at
its
flavor
this
brew
drinks
very
pleasantly
it
has
an
almost
sweet
malty
flavor
that
is
backed
up
by
significant
body
unlike
some
of
the
other
darker
beers
i
enjoy
this
beer
actually
lives
up
to
the
billing
advertised
by
its
appearance
this
brew
has
a
very
nice
body
to
it
that
lends
it
a
significance
it
is
not
at
all
watery
and
is
chock
full
of
flavor
the
only
downside
to
this
heft
however
is
that
it
tends
to
make
this
a
beer
best
enjoyed
in
moderation
as
it
quickly
gets
a
bit
filling
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
all
around
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
because
i
could
drink
plenty
unfortunately
for
me
my
buddy
only
picked
up
two
of
these
for
me
on
his
most
recent
wisconsin
trip
a
good
drinkable
lager
not
only
is
this
sessionable
but
it
would
stand
up
to
more
than
a
few
porters
and
stouts
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
this
beer
is
great
because
of
well
balanced
flavors
the
dry
toasty
malt
pairs
well
with
the
lingering
soft
bitterness
at
less
than
6
the
result
is
a
beer
with
excellent
drinkability
highly
sessionable
in
my
opinion
thanks
to
demcorhip
for
picking
this
one
out
for
me
wow
is
this
a
rich
one
full
of
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
bursting
with
terrific
high
tailed
nutty
flavor
very
robust
and
creamy
great
mouthfeel
as
it
is
very
full
bodied
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
nice
pillowy
head
that
leaves
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
slight
bitterness
on
the
end
but
initial
booming
maltiness
a
top
flight
beer
no
doubt
a
16
fl
oz
bottle
this
beer
has
a
nice
dark
color
with
a
smell
of
caramel
and
chocolate
that
actually
resembles
a
porter
except
not
as
bitter
smooth
and
creamy
good
flavor
to
withstand
a
cold
winter
night
without
a
large
amount
of
alcohol

abv
d
nice
balance
and
easy
drinking
very
good
but
nothing
stunning
imo
i
first
had
this
beer
in
1997
and
was
my
first
introduction
to
the
sprecher
brewery
i
enjoy
its
full
body
and
malty
flavor
typically
i
like
beers
that
are
hoppier
the
black
bavarian
offers
a
a
nice
balance
without
being
too
sweet
very
drinkable
even
for
people
who
dont
like
dark
beer
thanks
to
ba
jeffkrenner
for
the
bottle
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
of
this
one
ill
have
to
find
others
of
this
style
to
try
new
in
town
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
a
metallic
twinge
and
extremely
faint
smokey
and
chocolate
hints
body
is
dark
brown
approaching
full
black
and
sports
a
rapidly
diminishing
tan
head
coffee
chocolate
dark
roasted
malts
has
an
almost
porter
like
flavor
at
first
but
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
slight
hints
of
molasses
through
the
middle
with
a
bitter
lingering
finish
at
times
it
has
porter
and
dunkel
flavors
but
never
truly
gets
all
that
schwarzbiery
still
decently
tasty
drinkability

this
is
one
of
the
best
schwartzbiers
that
ive
ever
had
to
include
the
six
years
that
i
lived
in
germany
pours
a
rich
black
hue
with
light
brown
highlights
underneath
a
formidable
semicreamy
semifoamy
tan
head
that
subsides
rather
quickly
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
a
nutty
character
thats
hard
to
pin
down
palate
is
again
mostly
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
chocolatey
lactose
sweetness
and
some
more
nutty
notes
body
is
richer
than
i
would
expect
for
a
schwarzbier
with
a
fullfigured
creaminess
more
characteristic
of
a
porter
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
im
pleasantly
surprised
an
opaque
black
brew
with
tiny
hints
of
brown
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
looks
nice
the
nose
is
syrupy
coffee
and
roasted
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
plums
up
front
followed
by
strong
coffee
and
hints
of
caramel
coffee
taste
lingers
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
slightly
above
average
one
of
sprechers
best
brews
drinkability
fantastic
if
only
other
breweries
would
try
brewing
a
beer
in
this
style
lagers
wouldnt
have
such
a
bad
rap
drinkability
sessionable
and
pleasant
this
was
the
perfect
complement
to
the
baseball
game
i
was
watching
at
the
time
and
definitely
a
beer
ill
return
to
does
a
good
job
avoiding
sweetness
and
remaining
true
to
the
style
drinkability
is
very
high
in
fact
about
as
good
as
this
style
can
get
the
beer
is
full
and
rich
taste
and
smooth
it
is
well
balanced
with
enough
edge
satisfy
lovers
of
both
lighter
and
darker
styles
prost
und
zum
wohl
mk
d
this
beer
has
nice
complexity
but
is
smooth
and
light
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
the
chocolate
malt
and
cream
offer
a
great
flavor
without
being
overpowering
or
sweet
black
yes
black
indeed
coal
black
had
i
been
given
this
in
a
blind
taste
test
id
bet
a
significant
amount
of
money
that
this
was
a
robust
porter
along
the
lines
of
rogue
mocha
porter
dark
roasted
malt
without
a
hint
of
oxidation
of
course
i
do
have
the
benefit
of
drinking
the
brew
in
its
home
state
thick
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
a
distinct
coffee
note
picks
up
some
sweetness
at
the
finish
with
a
lingering
bitterness
that
is
still
fairly
clean
whatever
the
style
this
is
a
nicely
done
beer
really
a
very
nice
schwarzbier
a
big
bitterness
and
some
dark
malts
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
dark
lagers
this
is
a
winner
mouthfeel
the
malts
were
awesome
moving
over
my
mouth
they
mixed
well
with
my
garlic
enveloped
pizza
a
little
cloying
maybe
the
malts
i
mean
pours
a
deep
black
with
just
the
slightest
ruby
tones
around
the
edges
a
thick
long
lasting
tan
head
bubbles
here
and
there
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
breaking
up
into
strands
on
the
way
down
quite
nice
aroma
as
advertised
is
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
taking
on
faintly
roasted
and
spiced
tones
taste
is
a
nice
slide
from
roasty
malts
to
a
dry
bitter
and
almost
hopped
end
notes
of
chocolate
and
espresso
molasses
and
burnt
malt
mouth
is
a
not
as
thick
as
it
looks
which
is
a
little
disappointing
but
otherwise
good
mostly
smooth
with
a
slight
spring
to
keep
things
interesting
and
while
it
isnt
as
thick
as
id
hoped
it
makes
it
a
little
easier
to
drink
and
combined
with
the
good
look
smell
and
taste
im
thinking
ill
stock
this
a
little
more
often
now
definitely
sprechers
best

a
classic

and
thanks
to
shbobdb
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
excellent
midwestern
brew

had
never
even
heard
of
it
oh
the
joys
of
a
blind
trade
well
done
sprecher
muy
bien
very
drinkable
very
delicious
its
smell
is
forgettable
but
this
beer
isnt
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
complex
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
chocolate
roasted
and
black
malts
its
sweet
smelling
with
chocolate
notes
along
with
a
slightly
earthyroasted
edge
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
smooth
chocolatey
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
sweet
and
a
bit
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
dark
lager
it
has
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
drinker
picked
up
a
single
at
rileys
while
visiting
madison
wi
the
characters

are
printed
on
the
neck
of
the

damn
good
beer
drinkability
notes

a
tasty
lager
and
my
second
favorite
shwarzbier
behind
only
the
fabulous
offering
from
moonlight
not
exactly
to
style
but
im
not
complaining
too
much
drinkability
bold
and
complex
this
is
something
that
should
be
emjoyed
one
at
a
time
would
pair
nicely
with
roast
beef
or
a
rare
steak
who
says
there
are
no
good
lager
brewers
in
the
u
s
brew
pours
to
a
black
color
allowing
a
slight
amount
of
light
through
with
a
fair
sized
head
that
has
some
retention
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
burnt
malts
that
give
of
scents
of
coffee
caramel
chocolate
and
toffee
overall
an
excellent
smelling
brew
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
with
the
malt
dominant
caramel
chocolate
and
toffee
like
tastes
also
a
very
dry
feel
to
it
this
is
a
extremely
excellent
brew
one
of
my
favorite
styles
as
well
drinkability
above
average
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
easy
to
drink
sprecher
continues
to
be
one
of
the
great
underappreciated
breweries
specializing
in
quality
lagers
fairly
dark
basically
black
just
like
the
label
suggests
with
a
lively
tan
head
the
smell
is
nice
and
malty
with
some
coffee
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
i
was
shocked
at
the
first
sip
quite
bold
lots
and
lots
of
burnt
malts
and
a
fair
amount
of
hop
with
a
lageryeast
taste
as
well
in
truth
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
an
american
double
stout
but
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
and
more
carbonated
it
lacks
the
alcohol
punch
of
a
stout
but
the
flavor
is
nearly
as
complex
as
a
sipper
its
hard
to
call
this
one
refreshing
but
it
is
satisfying
for
sure
this
is
only
the
2nd
sprecher
i
have
tried
i
sippped
on
a
maibock
in
chicago
this
summer
but
i
will
probably
try
to
sample
some
more
of
their
stuff
in
the
future
overall
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
one
i
wish
i
could
find
out
here
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
it
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
note
of
dark
chocolate
if
sprecher
black
bavarian
contained
cherries
it
would
be
a
dead
ringer
for
the
beer
equivalent
of
black
forest
cake
come
to
think
of
it
thats
not
a
bad
idea
id
hate
to
mess
this
one
up
though
since
its
such
a
fabulously
complex
delicious
beer
as
is
is
it
the
best
american
schwarzbier
in
existence
if
not
its
damn
close
dense
but
clear
pour
with
blood
red
highlights
thin
film
of
foam
on
top
very
creamy
nose
is
very
nutty
with
a
big
hit
of
vanilla
oatmeal
drizzled
with
clover
honey
expands
as
it
warms
tastes
great
with
a
big
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
big
roasted
malts
and
overly
hoppy
for
a
schwarz
grassy
finish
thanks
to
the
lager
character
and
hops
oh
and
there
is
a
nice
even
bitterness
that
hangs
around
for
a
few
wow
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
a
great
example
of
american
craft
understanding
of
a
rare
euro
beer
style
havent
been
the
biggest
fan
of
sprecher
but
this
one
is
the
cats
meow
beer
is
good
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
beer
and
an
interesting
style
but
i
cant
say
im
extremely
fond
of
it
its
a
camel
with
parts
from
a
bunch
of
different
styles
still
its
easy
to
drink
so
impress
your
friends
and
chug
a
really
dark
beer
16
ounce
bottle
thanks
mabz
ive
never
seen
such
a
dark
lager
before
pours
porter
black
with
a
decent
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
spotty
coating
nose
is
subtle
slightly
hoppy
lager
smell
with
faint
chocolatecoffee
malts
at
the
tail
end
taste
follows
suit
bitter
chocolately
malts
balanced
out
by
mild
hops
with
some
dark
fruity
notes
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
its
decent
carbonation
makes
it
refreshing
on
a
summer
day
like
today
which
is
bordering
100
degrees
gotta
love
wisconsin
summers
a
pleasant
surprise
from
sprecher
here
their
special
amber
was
pretty
good
as
well
but
as
a
dark
beer
man
i
enjoyed
this
one
considerably
more
give
it
a
try
drinkability
is
good
and
abv
isnt
quite
out
of
control
but
nonetheless
i
couldnt
picture
myself
sessioning
these
it
is
too
rich
and
is
better
enjoyed
at
a
snails
pace
pick
it
up
if
you
can
anyways
it
pours
a
beautiful
dark
ruby
tinged
brown
with
a
long
lasting
2
finger
beige
head
aroma
is
intially
very
sweet
maybe
overly
sweet
but
nice
little
roasted
notes
round
out
the
nose
taste
brings
me
back
to
brazil
where
schwarzs
are
fairly
common
there
is
a
nice
interplay
between
the
sweetness
and
slightly
bitter
roastiness
that
makes
this
a
very
versatile
beer
great
for
sessioning
or
sipping
top
class
beer
from
sprecher
and
a
great
intro
into
schwarzs
as
a
style
16
ounce
bottle
pours
out
a
dark
brown
tinted
red
there
is
not
much
head
the
aroma
is
dark
malts
with
nuts
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
at
first
the
hops
come
in
with
some
spiciness
medium
mouthfeel
but
big
on
flavor
this
beer
has
a
great
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
i
havent
had
many
schwarzbiers
but
this
is
a
very
tasty
one
putting
it
in
16
ounce
bottles
is
a
nice
touch
since
12
ounce
bottles
occasionally
leave
you
thirsting
for
more
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
mediocre
head
smells
malty
though
theres
a
bit
of
cream
and
sugar
scent
to
it
as
well
the
malt
appears
to
be
more
roasted
in
the
flavor
the
roastiness
creating
sort
of
a
burnt
bitter
crunch
at
the
end
backed
up
by
a
small
amount
of
hops
im
getting
some
molases
flavor
as
well
as
some
milky
creamy
notes
and
a
nice
dusty
character
that
im
always
happy
to
see
in
this
style
really
a
lot
of
dark
flavors
in
there
with
out
the
thickness
and
heaviness
of
a
stout
or
a
porter
a
great
alternative
full
of
flavor
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
from
wisconsin
you
could
probably
fool
me
into
thinking
this
was
an
authentic
german
brew
a
big
thanks
to
goes
to
ben
for
this
tasty
brew
pours
out
pitch
black
with
a
good
sized
foamy
tan

decent
retention
and
lacing
are
left
around
the
glass
roasty
chocolate
malts
are
in
full
force
with
a
great
caramel
sweetness
backing
it
up
some
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
a
small
amount
of
dark
fruits
aromas
are
in
there
as
well
very
rich
aroma
taste
starts
off
with
a
dose
of
caramel
before
the
huge
roastiness
comes
through
chocolate
is
noted
as
well
and
this
ends
with
a
nice
bitter
roasty
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
rich
and
creamy
goes
down
quite
smooth
i
could
drink
a
large
number
of
these
i
wish
i
had
a
large
number
to
drink
as
this
would
make
a
great
session
brew
this
is
really
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
really
wowed
me
finishes
with
a
few
seconds
of
lingering
bitterness
calling
for
a
bite
of
brat
and
cheese
at
the
end
of
each
drink
of
this
fine
brew
but
alas
have
none
overall
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
ruby
dark
brownblack
with
a
fizzy
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
nuts
and
slight
coffee
very
mild
smell
taste
is
exceptional
slight
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
a
definite
acidic
bitterness
from
the
malts
shines
throught
hopping
is
mild
yeast
makes
a
small
twangy
appearance
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
great
very
smooth
and
full
yet
light
making
this
beer
very
drinkable
a
top
notch
session
dark
beer
i
love
this
stuff
and
am
thankful
to
live
in
milwaukee
because
this
stuff
is
readily
available
on
tap
it
is
even
better
on
tap
i
too
was
impressed
with
the
black
pour
from
the
16oz
bottle
with
good
inch
tan
head
could
see
the
rubybrown
undertones
when
held
to
the
light
nice
choc
lately
malt
aroma
smooth
easy
taste
not
quite
as
much
earthy
grainy
taste
as
other
black
beers
good
lite
to
medium
texture
and
tingle
in
the
first
half
of
the
pint
but
the
tingle
died
somewhat
by
the
end
should
have
had
a
couple
more
to
doublecheck
drinkablity
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
of
all
time
too
bad
the
only
local
source
for
this
beer
seems
to
stock
older
bottles
i
am
sure
that
a
fresher
bottle
would
exhibit
atleast
some
hint
of
coffee
and
have
a
more
pronounced
feel
to
it
i
get
this
as
often
as
i
am
able
to
and
i
enjoy
every
sip
drinkability
is
good
very
tastey
lager
will
be
adding
this
to
the
short
list
of
the
other
two
lagers
i
actually
enjoy
hope
i
can
find
this
down
south

a
larger

that
stayed
through
several
sips
and
gave
a
little
lacing

a
good
smell
of
dark
and
roasted
malt
with
a
dollop
of
fruithopiness
this
is
pretty
much
how
it
tastes
except
much
more
intense
flavor
and
the
fruity
hops
are

aftertaste

the
roastedness
of
the
malt

good
job
sprecher
the
label
doesnt
lie
all
black
body
tan
welllingering
head
smell
is
of
bitter
chocolate
malt
the
overall
malt
smell
is
dominating
and
rich
taste
is
also
extremely
malty
very
bitter
and
rich
chcolate
flavors
body
is
fairly
thin
for
the
beer
but
this
is
still
a
good
brew
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
once
it
falls
it
has
a
slight
smell
of
the
lager
stank
at
the
beginning
but
there
are
some
malty
notes
in
there
some
roasted
malts
mostly
the
flavor
is
comprised
mostly
of
the
roasted
malts
coffee
but
there
is
a
little
chocolate
flavor
in
there
as
well
finish
is
dry
drinkability
is
nice
body
is
a
little
light
for
me
but
still
good
the
beer
pours
a
very
very
dark
brown
wtih
a
finger
of
tanish
head
that
falls
to
just
coat
the
beer
the
nose
tells
me
im
drinking
a
lager
initially
but
as
the
beer
warms
this
lager
scent
fades
the
overriding
tone
in
this
one
is
bitter
coffee
with
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
i
ding
the
flavor
is
huge
on
the
coffee
flavor
with
some
hints
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
the
feel
is
thick
with
a
nice
balance
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
this
is
a
really
nicely
crafted
beer
i
like
it
i
typically
dislike
lagers
but
this
one
had
a
wonderful
taste
that
will
bring
me
back
this
is
an
awesome
schwartzbier
they
must
have
really
used
the
schwartz
when
they
brewed
up
this
one
a
dark
black
beer
with
brown
edges
and
a
small
chestnut
coloured
head
of
foam
the
aromas
are
spicy
and
nutty
with
roasted
malts
in
the
mix
as
well
this
smells
just
like
a
schwartzbier
should
to
me
the
taste
is
spicy
up
front
with
a
nice
roasted
nuttiness
the
middle
is
sweeter
and
more
full
with
a
distinct
roasted
maltyness
finally
the
finish
is
dry
refreshing
spicy
and
faintly
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
perfect
as
is
the
drinkability
a
first
class
lager
brewed
in
the
good
ole
usa
aroma
is
dark
chocolate
and
some
butterscotch
maybe
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
too
the
beer
exhibits
an
average
body
with
a
slight
syrupy
texture
small
yet
prickly
carbonation
awakens
my
tongue
as
i
drink
the
flavor
is
roasted
malt
and
almost
bitter
coffee
black
patent
malt
i
almost
want
to
say
smokey
as
well
verynice
finish
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
in
my
mouth
after
i
swallow
the
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
tasty
treat
for
sure
now
if
these
only
came
into
ct
drinkability
a
very
good
schwarzbier
good
complexity
and
great
staying
power
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
i
popped
the
cap
and
there
was
no
sound
at
all
i
was
a
bit
nervous
about
the
carbonation
but
it
turned
out
ok
pours
out
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
is
kind
of
small
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
malt
come
out
in
the
smell
the
first
thing
you
notice
in
the
taste
is
the
smokey
notes
it
then
turns
more
sweet
like
caramel
and
chocolate
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
the
smoked
flavor
is
not
too
overpowering
which
is
something
i
hate
this
is
perfect
if
you
are
nervous
about
trying
a
beer
that
has
smoked
flavor
this
is
a
good
starting
point
appearance
is
very
nice
impressive
opaque
black
rich
coffee
coloured
brown
head
aroma
consists
of
chocolate
deep
roasted
malt
toasted
caramel
molasses
and
brown
sugar
flavors
translate
into
a
blend
of
the
pleasant
aromas
while
shifting
from
a
black
coffee
bitterness
to
a
chocolate
and
natural
sugar
cane
sweetness
a
touch
of
black
licorice
is
underlying
strangely
these
flavors
tantalize
but
trail
off
way
to
soon
with
none
of
the
oscillating
lingering
roasty
bitterness
and
dark
chocolate
sweetness
typical
of
the
style
seems
to
thin
as
it
warms
a
decent
brew
with
good
drinkability
but
as
i
finish
the
brew
theres
nothing
left
to
remind
of
which
brew
i
just
drank
this
schwarzbier
poured
a
clear
very
very
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
with
tan
foam
that
settled
and
coated
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
fruity
with
light
caramel
the
taste
was
fruity
raisins
with
caramel
and
malt
the
hops
were
very
light
but
there
was
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
smooth
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
flavor
lingered
lightly
this
was
a
nice
beer
though
it
did
not
seem
to
be
a
typical
schwarzbier

my
definite
favorite
of
the
8pack
maybe
the
best
dark
lager
ive
had
in
years
nearly
black
with
a
thick
head
and
excellent
retention
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
with
a
smokiness
in
the
background
body
is
full
and
smooth
and
the
flavor
of
this
brew
is
fantastic
smoky
malt
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
dark
roast
coffee
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
which
adds
some
balance
it
poured
charcoal
black
with
a
quality
tan
beady
head
i
got
a
nice
smoke
and
chocolate
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
big
full
and
very
smooth
excellent
there
is
a
definitely
a
chocolate
overtone
to
the
taste
great
balance
within
though
certainly
some
carmelized
malts
involved
as
well
it
finishes
quenching
and
toasty
at
the
very
moment
you
think
its
fading
to
oblivion
you
are
treated
to
the
slightest
roasty
bitterness
amazing
how
it
lingers
really
a
treasure
im
very
impressed
with
sprechers
offerings
among
the
pale
pilseners
at
the
downtown
chicago
kristkindl
market
is
a
keg
of
pale
pilseners
evil
twin
pours
with
a
hearty
brown
head
over
a
body
that
looks
solid
black
in
a
plastic
cup
then
shows
brown
highlights
as
i
drink
it
kind
of
a
black
bread
smell
thats
not
as
prominent
as
a
stout
definite
dark
roast
malts
against
a
german
hop
profile
leaves
a
taste
at
the
back
of
the
palate
where
bitterness
and
astingency
are
detected
roast
coffee
taste
perhaps
a
note
of
pear
subdued
by
its
clean
lager
finish
brings
up
a
bit
of
a
burnt
toast
taste
toward
the
end
that
may
not
be
to
everyones
liking
but
i
like
its
complexity
overall
impression
is
that
this
beer
drinks
pretty
much
like
a
stout
it
has
a
bit
of
the
creaminess
of
a
schwarzbier
but
none
of
the
sweetness
with
the
strength
of
a
bock
and
because
of
this
ive
rated
this
beer
a
little
lower
ive
had
some
difficulty
finding
fresh
sprecher
beers
for
awhile
but
im
happy
to
report
this
is
no
longer
the
case
sampled
92103
this
has
got
to
be
the
best
schwarzbier
ive
ever
had
and
id
be
only
too
happy
to
try
any
challengers
if
they
can
taste
better
than
this
bring
em
on
the
taste
starts
very
stout
like
with
a
big
rush
of
dark
malt
but
quickly
turns
bitter
and
burnt
but
without
a
lot
of
hop
bitterness
scant
taste
of
licorice
at
the
end
a
very
interesting
brew
my
first
schwarzbier
this
is
better
than
i
remember
kostriztersp
being
certainly
seems
to
have
more
body
and
bitterness
overall
acts
like
a
thin
porter
real
good
but
not
very
substantial
definitely
a
quality
brew
but
this
style
has
yet
to
totally
impress
me
as
it
is
so
thin
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
although
subtle
very
good
balance
overall
real
cool
bottle
though
thanks
for
the
sample
monk
black
as
night
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
out
quickly
while
leaving
ample
well
placed
and
delicate
lacing
sweet
chocolate
malts
rise
up
from
the
glass
in
the
mouth
a
sheer
delight
lovely
intense
bitter
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
malted
milk
followed
by
creamy
mocha
medium
to
full
bodied
yet
balanced
just
rightnever
over
assertive
in
a
sweet
cloying
way
as
some
sprecher
brews
have
come
off
to
me
this
may
be
the
first
sprecher
product
that
ive
wanted
to
revisit
other
than
the
sodas
which
are
first
rate
drinkability
rather
potable
this
would
definitely
be
one
to
have
lying
around
were
it
available
in
my
neighborhood
one
of
the
better
bottles
from
a
recent
trade
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
a
world
class
beer
clear
black
brew
that
sparkles
with
hints
of
brown
and
red
in
the
light
pretty
thick
black
foam
tops
it
off
aromas
of
burnt
grains
fairly
malty

up
front
hops
are
lightly
herbal
with
a
little
bit
of
a
kick
some
very
faint
chocolate
or
sugar
hints
throughout
i
think
a
good
schwarzbier
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
deep
color
in
a
mediumbodied
package
and
this
does
that
well
not
a
standout
brew
in
general
but
very
drinkable
and
pretty
damn
good
thanks

this

in

an

sense
of

by
an

its
as
if
the

evaporates
as
it

from

a

a

for
me
as
its
been
years
since
ive
had
a
beer
from
this
magnificent
brewery
my
thanks
go
to
tavernjef
for
this
bottle
gracias
tanto
mi
amigo
this
one
poured
a
dark
brown
tansparent
color
with
a
tan
head
that
lasted
only
a
few
seconds
aroma
was
bold
of
roasty
malts
almost
too
harsh
for
my
nose
taste
showed
me
that
roatiness
again
very
roasted
molasses
was
dominant
along
with
caramel
as
a
secondary
malt
flavor
not
any
hop
bitterness
but
this
beer
shouldnt
have
any
there
was
a
chalky
yeasty
finish
that
wasnt
nice
at
first
but
improved
as
i
drank
it
this
wasnt
good
at
first
drink
but
by
the
end
i
wanted
another
immediately
feel
is
solid
medium
body
smoothness
picks
up
some
fullness
in
the
middle
and
finishes
smooth
lightly
crisp
with
a
mellow
tangy
smokey
lingering
dryness
an
incredibly
drinkable
yummy
showing
of
the
style
well
rounded
and
smooth
it
poured
into
the
glass
a
very
dark
brown
color
w
some
reddish
bricking
it
was
translucent
the
head
was
a
tightly
bubbled
tan
color
that
started
out
quite
large
and
diminished
slowly
the
nose
had
some
heavy
sweet
malty
tones
in
it
the
flavor
has
a
touchy
of
smokiness
along
w
some
hoppy
notes
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
a
beautiful
black
color
with
red
highlights
its
topped
off
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
hangs
for
a
while
malt
this
style
features
malt
and
it
begins
with
the
aroma
rich
maltslightly
smokey
and
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
the
complex
malt
flavor
is
chewy
caramel
with
a
nuttysmokeytoasty
finish
to
dry
off
the
malt
and
keep
the
beer
close
to
my
lips
it
has
a
nice
medium
body
and
a
very
creamy
texture
with
maybe
a
hint
of
roast
malt
thrown
in
to
complete
the
malt
maze
a
classic
rare
style
a
little
larger
than
a
dunkel
but
very
inviting
as
a
session
brew
yum
one
of
the
breweries
i
miss
most
not
living
in
the
midwest
anymoreall
of
sprcher
beers
i
have
had
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
is
one
of
the
few
i
like
in
this
styleand
i
really
like
it
black
with
some
ruby
highlights
with
great
creamy
headvery
malty
fruity
aroma
very
appetizing
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
tasting
with
roasted
malt
the
biggest
flavor
componentbut
also
chocolata
and
a
very
appetizing
caramel
background
for
how
rich
it
looks
its
very
easy
to
drink
loved
it
and
will
be
enjoying
again
soon
this
is
a
very
nice
american
schwarzbier
nice
to
see
someone
doing
such
a
good
job
with
this
alltoneglected
style
rich
dark
cherry
in
color
with
a
rather
good
sized
dark
brown
head
roasted
malts
dominate
the
nose
flavors
range
from
a
subtle
chocolate
to
a
moderate
roastedness
observed
a
lightmoderate
nuttiness
that
seemed
to
fade
as
it
warmed
smokey
flavors
underscore
everything
and
hurt
the
drinkability
for
me
a
fine
brew
that
i
wouldnt
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
if
it
werent
for
cokes
wow
i
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
head
is
solid
but
thin
and
dissipates
fairly
quickly
color
is
a
deep
red
appearing
black
untill
held
up
to
the
lights
very
drinkable
with
strong
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
new
to
this
style
of
beer
and
getting
over
a
head
cold
cant
wait
to
see
what
else
is
hiding
in
that
bottle
poured
black
in
color
with
red
hues
apparent
where
light
hit
on
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
glass
foamy
tan
head
aroma
had
a
roasted
malt
sweetness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
thin
body
finish
has
a
bitterness
to
it
combined
with
a
robust
chocolate
malt
flavor
slight
nuttiness
to
it
smokiness
present
throughout
also
excellent
beer
to
combine
with
hearty
german
fare
or
bbq
definitely
one
of
sprechers
finer
offerings
i
just
wish
this
was
more
easily
available
around
here
beautiful
mahogany
color
and
a
tan
head
that
struggles
to
maintain
the
roasted
malt
is
soooo
roasty
here
that
i
hazard
a
guess
that
some
of
it
has
been
subjected
to
a
smoker
a
la
bamberg
rauchbier
the
neck
label
claims
it
as
a
kulmbacher
style
one
that
im
not
familiar
with
flavorful
sweetness
combines
with
coffee
grounds
and
bitter
chocolate
the
finish
is
medium
in
length
with
a
breath
of
stainless
steel
not
bad
unique
cheers
to
jon
for
the
sample
this
one
poured
black
just
like
the
name
would
imply
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
shows
a
little
burgundy
color
but
still
this
sucker
is
black
i
smell
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
with
a
very
faint
hop
bite
it
has
a
bit
of
a
coffeelike
mouthfeel
which
is
pleasing
to
my
palate
this
is
an
excellent
schwarzbier
from
the
great
brewery
that
is
sprecher
being
a
schwarzbier
lover
i
thought
i
would
have
liked
this
better
it
poured
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
deep
black
in
color
the
malty
aroma
was
a
little
too
prominent
for
me
however
the
roasty
flavor
is
much
heavier
than
other
schwarzbiers
i
have
had
also
but
as
the
long
lasting
flavor
lingers
on
the
tongue
i
enjoy
it
more
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
favorite
schwarz
good
head
on
a
hard
pour
medium
bubbles
and
a
stiff
one
inch
layer
color
is
a
rubyblack
lets
light
through
a
little
yeasty
in
smell
mostly
sweet
malty
flavor
but
not
overly
sweet
close
to
rich
and
nutty
but
attenuated
a
little
on
the
light
bodied
side
but
fresh
tasting
drinkable
but
not
as
tasty
as
a
saranac
black
forest
lager
porter
stout
beer
of
some
sort
i
know
its
a
lager
but
it
had
me
confused
very
porterlike
in
appearance
and
taste
coffee
taste
is
prevelent
but
not
overwhelming
lots
of
malt
in
this
one
i
liked
it
big
rocky
head
on
top
then
microbubbles
black
body
with
ruby
highlights
chocolate
coffee
and
hops
in
the
nose
wonderful
smooth
across
the
tongue
great
malts
but
with
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
could
be
drunk
as
a
session
beer
except
it
could
spoil
you
this
might
be
the
best
dark
lager
ive
ever
had
what
can
their
imperial
stout
do
as
an
encore
a
beer
above
all
others
this
should
be
the
beer
that
made
milwaukee
famous
the
other
reviewers
have
perfectly
described
the
way
one
taste
of
this
beer
informs
you
that
no
other
bavarian
style
beer
brewed
in
america
can
hold
a
candle
to
a
malty
taste
that
is
so
rich
and
complex
followed
with
a
burst
of
coffee
and
hop
sizzle
midnight
color
that
revealed
a
ruby
undertone
when
held
to
a
strong
light
if
you
can
find
it
in
a
bottle
great
but
if
you
can
find
it
on
tap
thank
whatever
god
or
goddess
you
pray
to
this
beer
seems
black
and
has
a
small
tan
head
that
is
gone
within
seconds
this
is
a
beer
that
you
can
seemingly
smell
the
thickness
great
malty
toasty
roasty
bitter
aromas
what
a
creamy
mouthfeel
feels
like
velvet
as
it
rolls
across
the
tongue
great
complexity
to
this
brew
there
arent
any
overbearing
tastes
but
many
underlying
ones
that
mesh
well
together
coffee
roast
malt
biscuit
mocha
and
toffee
to
name
a
few
i
just
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
it
has
been
one
of
my
reliables
ever
since
i
tried
it
about
5
years
ago
there
arent
too
many
schwarzbiers
available
these
days
but
id
guess
itd
be
hard
to
improve
much
on
this
one
as
a
footnote
those
of
us
in
southern
central
wis
should
count
our
blessings
as
we
have
two
great
schwarzbier
offerings
to
enjoy
the
other
being
tyranenas
rockys
revenge
sadly
only
a
latewinter

you
cant
go
wrong
with
either

ok
schwarzbier
this
stuff
has

but
attractive
nonetheless
neither

polite
body
abv
theyve
been
at
it
since
1581
if
you
believe
wikiwhatsit
id
say
theyre
on
to
something
lets
hope
heineken
leaves
well
enough
alone
o
smooth
and
easydrinking
nice
schwarzbier
the
beer
is
wonderfully
flavorful
with
pilsner
qualities
on
the
finish
but
still
contains
full
malt
qualities
smooth
black
lager
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
cloying
at
all
decent
not
awesome
i
bet
this
4
4
abv
version
is
better
than
the
lower
abv
one
everything
about
this
beer
is
lovely
on
tap
always
from
what
i
gather
at
sobo
151
on

a
really
great

to
watch

and
european
lager
yeast
clean
and
light
im
surprised
it
comes
in
under
4
abv
but
i
guess
it
makes
sense
ive
been
drinking
liters
all
night
and
feel
pretty
straight
a
great
accompaniment
to
traditional
czech
dishes
but
also
awesome
as
a
standalone
or
a
stand
in
for
a
meal
for
that
matter
full
bodied
but
still
clean
drinking
and
not
real
filling
some
dried
fruit
notes
in
among
the
dark
malt
trees
a
nice
autumnal
cornucopia
malt
driven
but
not
unhopped
a
delightful
beer
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
again
soon
one
of
the
better
imports
going
right
now
semi
macro
at
that
o
great
example
of
a
black
lager
nice
malt
flavor
with
a
light
body
very
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
good
session
bier
even
though
its
dark
in
color
overall
light
but
offers
enough
to
stay
interesting
and
very
drinkable
good
easy
roasted
beer
tastes
like
the
foil
wrap
that
covers
the
neck
and
cap
i
dont
want
to
be
too
much
of
a
naysayer
so
ill
use
a
filler
here
blah

i
couldnt
make
it
past
the
third
sip

dumped
pretty
good
uncomplicated
yet
it
has
a
satisfying
wholesomeness
to
it
looks
the
part
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
emphasise
the
roasted
malt
and
faint
sweetness
that
belong
to
this
beer
style
some
faint
offnotes
dont
spoil
it
too
much
decent
body
not
mindblowing
but
very
drinkable
at
the
price
i
paid
for

i
could
see
myself
grabbing
some
more
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
please
disregard
those
scores
rjt
overall
good
beer
but
not
exactly
great
i
have
had
schwarzbiers
before
and
didnt
even
know
this
was
one
till
i
started
taking
my
first
sip
not
a
hard
beer
to
drink
and
pretty
easy
to
like
grab
a
glass
salud
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
mainly
of
dark
roasted
malt
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
fairly
one
dimensional
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
drinkability
it
is
a
million
times
better
on
tap
surprise
surprise
out
of
the
bottle
though
it
is
what
i
would
expect
from
a
czech
schwarzbier
the
crack
revealed
a
can
filled
to
the
brim
with
beer
and
the
glug
produced
some
very
fastdissipating
deeptan
head
that
ended
up
as
mere
wisps
color
was
a
deep
dark
colabrown
that
allowed
zero
light
penetration
even
the
white
bits
was
black
nose
smelled
of
coffee
tar
dark
chocolate
and
even
a
slight
metallic
tang
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
had
a
molasseslike
sharpness
on
the
tongue
that
may
have
accounted
for
the
metallic
smell
it
actually
tasted
much
better
than
it
smelled
with
a
licoriceanise
flavor
coupled
with
molasses
in
the
mouth
i
liked
that
it
was
not
sweet
at
all
and
coupled
with
its
low
abv
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
i
may
not
personally
want
more
than
a
couplefew
but
it
does
remain
a
candidate
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
i
suppose
for
a
light
beer
it
has
some
flavor
but
not
much
going
on
here
at
the
end
of
the
day
if
you
like
a
beer
dominant
in
malt
flavor
with
coffee
notes
this
one
is
for
you
i
would
recommend
brought
a
can
of
krusovice
cerne
home
from
a
recent
trip
to
europe
the
beer
poured
very
dark
opaque
with
slight
off
white
head
that
only
laced
at
the
beginning
the
smell
included
roast
hints
of
sweet
maltcaramel
and
some
dark
fruit
the
taste
did
not
dissapoint
there
was
toasted
breads
some
burnt
quality
to
the
brew
but
it
was
somewhat
weak
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
ok
good
carbonation
but
very
light
body
overall
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
the
abv
and
lighter
flavor
of
krusovice
cerne
make
it
a
good
candidate
for
a
dark
session
brew
goes
well
paired
with
brownies
500

1

old

black
with
a
thick
long

offwhite

and
much

is
of
sour
dough
toast
and
hints
of
hops
light
smooth
body
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
and
not
much
else
i
hope
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
next
time
o
better
than
the
imperial
but
not
a
great
schwarzbier
either
maybe
i
expected
too
much
of
krušovices
beer
but
this
one
is
a
bit
of
disappointment
to
me
too
average
with
nothing
special
to
be
remembered
of
overall
good
for
a
change
of
pace
i
normally
dont
drink
black
lagers
the
price
was
excellent
and
it
was
well
constructed
i
will
recommend
this
to
my
friends
not
a
bad
schwarzbier
a
touch
thin
for
my
taste
but
good
flavors
for
what
it
had
black
with
some
brown
when
held
up
to
the
light
small
amount
of
offwhite
head
that
just
leaves
a
ring
around
the
glass
full
tangy
malt
nose
with
some
bakers
chocolate
light
creamy
body
rich
on
toasted
malts
unsweetened
chocolate
just
like
the
nose
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
tingles
all
the
way
to
the
finish
easy
drinking
full
malty
flavor
lightly
modified
with
bottle
consumed
in
august
2014
i
bought
this
not
paying
attention
that
the
bottle
dated
from
2009
so
i
have
to
give
props
for
the
excellent
head
retention
deep
clear
brown
color
it
has
a
roasted
malt
aroma
and
flavor
mild
and
drinkable
i
think
it
goes
especially
well
with
food
i
whipped
up
a
curried
rice
dish
for
dinner
the
food
brought
out
the
roasted
flavor
of
the
beer
as
far
as
mouthfeel
its
not
like
a
belhaven
but
then
again
were
not
talking
about
an
ale
here
this
is
a
dark
lager
i
would
have
this
again
hopefully
a
fresh
version
next
time
mediocre
for
a
schwarzbier
but
drinkable
pours
very
dark
brown
with
rubby
highlights
seems
opaque
but
is
actually
clear
capped
by
rather
thin
yet
wellformed
lighttan
creamy
head
that
holds
well
aroma
is
moderately
malty
with
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
qualities
and
herbalspicy
hops
in
the
background
flavor
is
rather
neutral
malt
with
moderate
herbalspicy
hops
leading
into
the
dry
finish
with
lingering
roastiness
complemented
by
hopbitterness
mediumlight
bodied
and
watery
on
the
palate
lighter
bodied
a
little
thin
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
at
its
best
not
the
best
of
style
but
pretty
good
at
first
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
stout
for
roasty
notes
upfront
and
smooth
creamy
malty
follow
through
theres
a
slight
acidic
bite
reminding
me
of
guinness
theres
more
character
than
a
guinness
stout
however
this
is
more
on
par
with
a
beamish
or
murphys
there
are
also
hints
of
licorice
and
toffee
heck
of
a
beer
wish
id
bought
more
a
nice
underlying
czech
lager
roasted
up
into
a
decent
cerny
pivo
or
schwarzbier
whatever
euro
specificity
one
subscribes
to
this
is
nearly
as
easy
drinking
as
it
gets
had
deeper
dark
lagers
but
light
and
drinkable
drinkability
well
balanced
equally
drinkable
lager
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
be
great
with
a
heavier
body
id
drink
it
again
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
o
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
down
and
by
out
of
my
way
i
mean
lift
a
finger
to
pick
one
up
mouthfeel
palate
is
lightbodied
light
carbonation
moderate
sweet
aftertaste
this
is
a
decent
beer
d
very
sessionable
you
would
think
the
beer
would
be
a
thick
stout
by
the
color
but
it
is
actually
a
rather
smooth
beer
to
drink
the
beer
has
the
tendancy
to
coat
your
tongue
which
is
less
appealing
but
the
taste
is
similar
to
that
of
its
smell
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
is
easy
to
drink
making
it
rather
sessionable
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
some
notes
of
coffee
taste
is
good
plenty
of
malts
a
bit
sweet
some
mild
coffee
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
brew
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
there
was
no
smoke
when
i
popped
the
cap
off
it
poured
a
dark
amberbrown
with
a
one
finger
head
which
left
shortly
but
a
ring
stayed
around
there
was
a
dark
fruit
malty
aroma
which
emitted
from
the
brew
the
taste
was
a
mix
of
malts
hops
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
watery
but
seemed
to
get
better
as
i
sipped
it
would
drink
this
again
not
one
that
i
would
choose
first
but
because
of
its
very
low
3
8
abv
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
from
time
to
time
o
respectable
showing
but
nothing
special
i
would
have
no
problems
having
this
one
again
some
time
schwartzbier
having
a
born
date
of
march
8
2009
perhaps
i
tried
this
way
too
late
i
dont
think
that
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
tried
a
year
later
at
all
i
will
try
again
when
i
see
it
fresher
however
for
a
year
old
it
pours
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
is
nice
looking
but
quickly
fades
there
is
no
nose
but
for
a
very
small
hint
of
pumpernickel
very
faint
wow
no
body
no
character
no
flavor
except
a
hint
of
yeast
and
hops
a
small
hint
not
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
a
year
old
again
will
revisit
this
review
if
and
when
i
try
a
fresh
one
drinkability
quenching
and
tasty
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
schwarzbiers
but
i
am
finding
this
one
rather
nice
smooth
and
creamy
nose
too
creamy
with
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
that
escalate
over
time
brownish
color
with
hints
of
black
foam
of
the
same
ilk
bitterness
which
becomes
progressively
stronger
during
the
tasting
with
traces
of
roasting
which
are
felt
in
the
palace
the
body
is
pretty
safe
even
acid
a
bit
like
bad
coffee
ground
poured
into
a
glass
mug
from
an
attractive
large
17oz
import
bottle
a
dark
blackish
brown
in
color
with
a
khaki
colored
head
bready
and
roasted
malt
aroma
flavor
has
the
black
malt
up
front
giving
way
to
bitterness
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
are
there
but
very
tame
slight
metallic
twinge
medium
bodied
lager
drinks
easy
but
there
are
better
tasting
examples
to
be
found
at
the
price
point
its
at
krusovice
is
a
decent
low
end
schwarzbier
option
overall
i
enjoy
the
beer
but
its
not
one
that
i
will
exclusively
go
after
or
try
to
find
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
drinkability
pretty
good
not
too
heavy
a
bit
like
a
light
porter
but
much
more
drinkable
maybe
about
34
in
a
session
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
has
a
nice
stiff
creamy
looking
head
above
a
dark
chocolate
colored
body
with
deep
red
highlights
smells
very
malty
with
nice
roasted
and
smoked
aromas
as
well
theres
an
earthy
bite
to
this
beer
with
bitterness
and
slight
sour
sensations
all
over
with
those
same
burnt
and
smoked
flavors
coming
through
in
the
taste
as
well
the
body
is
pretty
thick
with
lower
carbonation
a
nice
beer
for
dark
lovers
looking
for
a
session
beer
poured
with
a
fluffy
floamy
frothy
thick
light
tan
head
that
lasted
a
long
time
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
dark
cherry
aroma
is
dark
malt
toffee
dark
pipe
tobacco
a
little
fresh
sawdust
fresh
turned
earth
and
in
a
word
nice
flavor
is
similar
but
not
quite
so
extravagent
dark
malt
a
bit
roasty
not
overly
sweet
super
easy
drinking
body
is
good
soft
but
not
overly
so
and
well
carbonated
for
what
it
is
finish
is
like
flavor
tapers
slowly
to
mid
length
and
prompts
me
to
want
a
little
cigar
i
like
this
beer
session
dvery
drinkable
not
very
much
in
the
hops
department
almost
stoutlike
watery
with
a
lightmedium
body
light
effervescence
fairly
smooth
a
good
flavor
but
a
weak
body
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
this
beer
isnt
bursting
with
flavor
but
it
has
nice
balance
and
is
drinkable
pours
out
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tanned
two
finger
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
with
medium
carbonation
and
leaves
little
lacing
at
first
a
caught
a
whiff
of
barnyard
but
it
mellowed
out
to
a
coffee
and
chocolate
smell
it
had
a
light
watery
mouth
feel
with
a
burnt
coffee
chocolate
taste
and
a
hint
of
metallic
overall
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
had
this
one
on
my
trip
to
slovaki
and
reviewing
from
notes
poured
from
the
500ml
bottle
into
a
pilsner
style
glass
the
beer
looks
great
and
tastes
ok
light
with
touches
of
roasted
on
the
borderline
of
being
burnt
some
bitterness
highly
sessionable
at
3
8
creamy
and
full
but
slightly
slick
finishes
a
bit
chalky
tasty
and
pretty
drinkable
decent
enough
easy
drinking
beer
would
drink
again
the
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
honey
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
light
toffee
and
caramel
malts
with
some
yeast
thin
watery
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
a
schwarzbier
is
always
a
schwarzbier
this
is
of
course
a
nice
beer
but
not
the
best
schwarzbier
ive
had
d
this
beer
is
very
smooth
nice
dark
black
malt
flavor
but
it
is
a
bit
soft
d
could
drink
this
all
night
satisfying
and
very
relaxing
to
drink
overall
it
was
nice
to
try
this
gold
medal
prague
beer
though
i
am
sure
this
brew
is
much
better
directly
at
the
source
in
all
a
bit
bland
no
specific
highlights
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
with
red
hue
having
a
nice
pillowy
head
with
light
lace
smell
having
a
malty
earthiness
to
it
taste
has
just
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
note
of
chocolate
with
a
nice
hop
balance
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
body
and
carbonation
a
bit
more
mellow
than
most
schwarzbiers
ive
tried
making
a
nice
drinker
for
me
d
easy
to
finish
very
sessionable
and
3
8
abv
with
a
better
than
expected
amount
of
flavor
check
this
one
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
good
but
not
as
exciting
as
i
remember
drinkability
this
is
not
a
style
i
normally
drink
so
ill
keep
my
mouth
shut
it
aint
bad
aint
great
try
it
for
yourself
bottle
shared
by
milos
a
deep
cola
pour
with
a
thin
beige
ring
nose
is
coffee
and
hops
musty
tobacco
some
pit
fruits
tastes
very
coffee
like
with
no
sweetness
whatsoever
dry
and
hoppy
with
dark
chocolate
too
surprisingly
light
bodied
and
super
easy
drinking
very
good
thanks
milos
overall
a
nice
larger
especially
for
the
value
but
not
something
i
will
be
coming
back
to
often
d
this
is
a
good
beer
i
really
like
this
style
although
i
have
had
only
one
other
schwarzbier
this
is
a
good
alternative
to
a
stout
or
porter
it
will
definitely
be
added
to
my
winter
lineup
flavorful
but
not
something
that
is
too
bold
in
its
flavor
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
wow
i
had
no
idea
when
i
ordered
this
beer
today
that
it
was
so
low
in
alcohol
i
knew
that
black
lagers
werent
necessarily
stronger
than
lighter
lagers
but
3
8
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
now
that
i
know
i
can
have
this
for
breakfest
lol
im
hooked
great
black
color
very
good
malty
test
very
very
drinkable
a
very
difficult
beer
to
sip
slowly
i
never
had
a
german
schwarz
as
good
as
this
highly
recommend
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
a
nice
two
fingered
head
forms
quickly
and
had
great
retention
large
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
has
a
distinct
noble
hop
aroma
just
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
starts
of
interesting
with
chocolate
notes
from
the
malt
combining
with
the
spicey
and
earthy
hop
flavors
unfortunately
the
flavor
is
short
lived
and
ends
very
watery
bitterness
is
low
to
moderate
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
does
have
a
nice
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
very
low
abv
and
gentle
flavors
the
flavor
just
falls
away
too
quickly
not
that
bad
especially
considering
the
low
3
price
tag
i
have
a
feeling
it
is
even
better
when
fresh
interestingly
this
beers
ingredients
include
water
malt
hops
and
artificial
sweetener
didnt
pick
up
any
off
flavors
or
unexpected
sweetness
in
the
brew
overall
recommend
not
like
some
harsher
german
schwarzbiers
that
ive
had
this
one
seemed
more
like
a
dark
pils
to
me
smooth
clean
dark
lager
interesting
take
on
the
style
overall
i
liked
the
beer
although
it
is
rather
mild
its
taste
has
nice
roasty
character
and
it
is
very
refreshing
overall
i
prefer
this
brewers
czech
pils
but
this
is
a
cheap
schwarzbier
if
you
are
in
the
mood
pours
cola
colored
medium
brown
and
translucent
with
light
tan
head
nose
is
roasty
but
rather
tame
even
with
a
good
solid
pour
and
large
head
light
coffee
taste
very
drinkable
and
a
rather
inoffensive
beer
could
be
a
nice
gateway
beer
for
people
apprehensive
about
dark
beers
just
an
ok
take
on
the
style
and
there
are
way
more
complex
out
there
check
it
out
but
only
if
readily
available
m
d
while
the
mouthfeel
was
not
good
medium
to
lite
body
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
day
maybe
in
the
summer
but
give
me
a
weiss
any
day
of
the
week
boy
is
this
one
a
disappointment
id
had
plenty
of
schwarzbier
when
over
in
berlin
markischer
landman
comes
to
mind
and
i
could
have
sworn
they
had
more
kick
than
this
this
beer
pours
beautifully
nice
head
and
looks
impressive
deep
rich
ruby
but
bottom
line
its
just
plain
watery
what
little
notes
there
are
are
lost
in
the
thinness
and
3
8
abv
just
dont
cut
it
isnt
this
what
they
call
in
the
states
sunday
beer
not
for
me
overall
cheap
and
enjoyable
beer
it
has
quite
a
lot
of
flavors
but
they
are
in
the
background
and
not
that
easy
to
identify
this
beer
is
well
worth
a
try
d
not
so
bad
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
much
more
drinkable
decent
mild
carbonation
that
lets
you
taste
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
just
short
of
being
buttery
smooth
its
almost
like
sipping
on
a
good
2
thinned
out
milk
in
the
way
that
it
coats
your
mouth
combine
that
with
a
mediocre
3
8
abv
and
this
one
is
easy
to
slug
down
this
czech
schwarzbier
pours
a
dark
brown
with
the
garnet
and
ruby
highlights
characteristic
of
the
style
the
tan
head
is
a
bit
smaller
than
i
would
have
expected
nose
is
moderately
malty
slightly
sweet
slightly
roasty
and
hop
aromas
are
more
or
less
absent
flavor
follows
nose
with
the
slightly
roasted
malts
leading
the
way
followed
by
some
sweet
notes
a
mildly
apparent
hopness
no
esters
or
diacetyl
detected
finishes
clean
with
a
slightly
bitter
and
quite
pleasant
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
to
light
with
a
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
black
beer
from
my
czech
brethren
that
i
will
be
having
again
it
would
be
a
good
first
schwarzbier
to
serve
up
to
one
of
your
cronies
the
taste
is
similar
dryish
toasty
overall
with
an
engaging
zestytingly
licorice
mild
very
dark
gingerbread
hints
of
prune
fermented
fruit
chocolate
it
has
a
finish
of
licorice
molasses
gingerbread
and
hints
of
singed
dry
leaves
and
coffee
bean
the
molassesy
gingerbread
dominates
the
aftertaste
and
lingers
it
has
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
its
tasty
and
easily
drinkable
clean
and
solid
light
but
characterful
and
engaging
the
feel
is
lively
tastes
dissapointingly
light
id
expect
something
that
looks
and
smells
like
this
to
have
a
bit
of
heft
to
it
a
much
more
watery
beer
than
i
really
wanted
here
espresso
flavorvery
much
like
a
thin
bodied
stout
very
dry
lots
of
biscuit
flavor
the
liquid
is
watery
which
doesnt
match
the
robust
flavor
profile
had
this
not
long
ago
at
a
czech
restaurant
in
concord
ca
came
in
a
big
bottle
with
its
own
its
own
unique
krusovice
goblet
which
added
its
appeal
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
on
several
levels
its
blackness
wasnt
that
black
its
body
was
water
thin
and
its
aroma
and
taste
were
less
burned
than
my
overcooked
schnitzel
i
hate
to
pan
this
beer
but
it
couldnt
stand
up
to
my
food
and
didnt
taste
good
on
its
own
and
fell
short
of
my
expectations
from

but
difficult

krusovice
is
a
goto
beer
when
in
doubt
overall
a
decent
schwarzbier
light
in
abv
with
a
decent
amount
of
roasted
and
toasted
flavors
a
rather
good
session
style
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
toasted
malt
and
cocoa
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
smoke
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
has
a
somewhat
dirty
flavor
and
a
better
smell
in
my
opinion
o
early
promise
but
disappointed
in
the
end
would
not
order
again
but
would
give
their
other
brews
a
chance
this
is
a
very
true
to
style
beer
not
hardly
deviating
at
all
from
the
traditional
recipe
the
pour
is
black
but
letting
some
light
pass
the
head
is
huge
three
inches
at
least
foamy
but
airy
and
with
good
staying
power
i
smell
roast
coffee
chocolate
malt
and
a
lager
yeast
that
is
working
wonders
with
this
complexity
the
flavor
vindicates
that
with
some
burnt
sugar
on
the
front
end
and
bitter
cocoa
on
the
back
end
tempered
only
by
a
touch
of
sweeter
german
malt
and
a
yeast
that
has
a
tendency
to
calm
everything
down
this
slides
down
the
throat
with
real
ease
and
is
much
lighter
than
it
looks
is
so
many
ways
it
feels
like
a
classic
german
dark
lager
mellow
fizz
creamy
oaty
feel
and
a
full
body
that
doesnt
limit
how
easily
and
quickly
it
can
be
consumed
this
was
delicious
not
intriguing
or
challenging
but
a
beer
you
keep
coming
back
to
because
its
consistently
well
made
bravo
for
this
overall
a
tasty
satisfying
and
highly
drinkable
schwarzbier
good
stuff
medium
bodied
with
a
sharp
effervescence
up
front
that
drops
off
quickly
drying
finish
cleaner
than
i
thought
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
had
on
tap
at
a
gb
restaurant
its
got
that
deep
black
body
medium
tan
head
dark
roasted
malts
are
apparent
on
the
nose
and
palate
slightly
bittersweet
pretty
wellbalanced
gb
definitely
does
malty
stuff
well
and
their
schwarzbier
is
as
expected
nothing
fancy
but
enjoyable
my
first
time
with
the
style
and
i
liked
this
one
poured
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
flowing
through
aroma
of
light
roast
smoke
some
chocolate
sweetness
flavor
follows
with
roasty
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
smoke
but
very
light
kind
of
a
very
light
porter
with
the
roasty
chocolate
smell
and
taste
finishes
well
with
just
a
hint
of
smoky
bitter
and
roasty
chocolate
lingering
on
the
palate
good
beer
came
out
a
deep
unassuming
black
a
small
beige
sheet
of
head
capped
it
off
the
nose
carried
notes
of
coffee
mild
cocoa
powder
and
faint
aromas
of
leafy
veggies
moderate
carbonation
here
decent
feel
good
roasted
flavors
noted
as
well
as
a
bit
of
a
hop
smack
on
the
finish
semisweet
dark
chocolate
mild
graininess
this
was
a
good
beer
and
really
hit
the
spot
on
this
midafternoon
stop
id
like
to
see
this
one
in
bottle
form
o
this
is
very
good
and
interesting
beer
it
is
dark
in
color
yet
light
in
taste
and
abv
lots
if
flavors
and
aromas
here
very
enjoyable
and
smooth
overall
it
might
be
my
favorite
from
this
particular
visit
enjoyed
this
beer
after
two
straight
bad
ones
it
may
be
my
nonseasonalgotobeer
from
gb
now
on
tap
gb
in
kcmo
pours
a
really
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
smells
of
some
caramel
malts
a
little
smoke
and
some
toasted
malt
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
some
caramel
malts
open
this
up
these
fade
to
a
little
smoked
malts
and
a
touch
of
fruits
watery
mouthfeel
that
also
translates
on
the
palate
this
is
a
decent
beer
worth
a
shot
but
i
was
ready
to
move
on
at
4
3
abv
this
is
highly
sessionable
from
the
tap
we
were
in
at
happy
hour
on
saturday
during
football
and
received
1
off
each
beer
its
great
to
wash
down
the
salty
happy
hour
special
appetizers
e
g
house
made
chips
with
blue
cheese
scallions
and
bacon
mini
pizza
i
would
entertain
this
with
a
good
hot
dog
loaded
with
sauerkraut
and
mustard
o
overall
a
pretty
godo
schwarzbier
up
there
with
their
marzen
as
one
of
their
better
beers
ive
had
easy
to
drink
and
vey
roasty
id
order
it
again
theres
a
black
patent
malt
presence
to
the
otherwise
mochaish
flavor
body
is
appropriate
for
the
style
watery
which
translates
to
being
thin
good
hop
ending
that
blends
well
with
the
darker
malt
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
of
toasted
nuts
and
dry
coffee
grounds
had
the
schwarzbier
at
the
g
b
in
bolingbrook
il
last
evening
the
color
was
a
deep
dark
amber
with
ecru
head
that
laced
slightly
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
hints
of
malt
and
espresso
the
taste
was
a
very
good
balance
of
grain
hops
and
malt
with
roastcoffee
following
the
was
a
slight
sweetness
that
made
the
beer
smooth
to
drink
and
the
beer
came
off
the
pallet
clean
overall
not
to
bad
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
i
need
a
little
bit
more
body
was
coffee
flavor
is
present
so
i
probably
would
not
coose
to
session
with
this
one
anyway
this
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
dark
malts
in
the
nose
moderately
roasty
not
much
else
to
speak
of
as
would
be
expected
in
the
style
dark
roasted
malts
in
the
taste
hints
of
coffee
and
not
much
else
little
to
no
hops
detectable
medium
bodied
and
perhaps
a
bit
thinner
than
some
of
the
worlds
better
schwarzbiers
but
still
good
and
really
the
only
gb
selection
i
desired
to
have
more
of
o
a
little
too
light
for
schwarzbier
but
other
than
that
very
good
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
bit
of
foamy
head
smells
of
roasts
malts
and
grains
tastes
much
the
same
with
hints
of
chocolate
burnt
grain
malts
and
a
nice
smooth
dry
roasted
finished
very
easy
to
drink
although
fairly
simple
and
forgettable
o
its
a
good
enough
beer
but
there
are
some
tweeks
particularly
with
the
finish
that
could
make
it
a
better
beer
for
me
d
it
was
an
ok
beer
but
not
the
best
may
have
to
try
this
one
again
to
make
sure
it
was
not
a
bad
batch
very
good
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
sampled
at
gordon
biersch
restaurant
in
dallas
tx
pours
almost
black
hue
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
coffee
nutty
and
some
toasted
malt
body
is
creamy
mediumfull
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
long
coffee
like
finish
on
the
whole
it
is
a
nice
session
brew
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
very
easy
to
have
several
of
these
d
easy
to
quaf
just
not
all
that
interesting
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
subdued
there
is
some
nice
roast
but
the
chocolate
and
earthy
notes
from
the
nose
are
quite
a
bit
more
muted
the
feel
is
nice
and
pretty
roasty
fairly
dry
in
general
with
a
nice
finish
drinkability
is
decent
enough
but
theres
not
enough
there
to
keep
me
hanging
on
pretty
good
drinking
beer
in
and
of
itself
however
it
seemed
to
me
leaning
more
in
the
porter
direction
again
it
was
served
with
a
small
offwhite
head
and
good
lace
which
seems
to
be
policy
at
gb
color
was
an
opaque
black
brown
aroma
was
malt
roast
vanilla
flavor
was
similar
plus
was
fairly
dry
and
well
balanced
body
was
full
and
round
with
good
carbonation
finish
was
like
flavor
and
of
medium
length
session
beer
would
i
recommend
this
beer
i
suppose
but
not
too
highly
o
great
example
to
style
but
would
have
liked
an
increase
in
hop
aroma
and
caramel
upfront
otherwise
the
initial
taste
is
a
little
watery
on
the
palate
otherwise
a
finely
crafted
beer
i
paired
this
with
the
steak
frite
done
medium
w
garlic
fries
drizzled
in
marzen
sauce
and
i
am
in
my
place
of
zen
especially
getting
to
use
my
aha
pub
discount
benefits
this
beer
set
me
back
2
bucks
its
good
to
be
a
homebrewer
aha
member
d
this
is
a
nice
schwarzbier
they
really
do
a
nice
job
with
all
these
greman
brews
enjoyed
at
the
san
jose
location
with
my
meal
this
german
style
brew
shows
a
deep
black
mahogany
color
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
and
very
little
lace
the
aroma
is
mild
coffee
grinds
and
delicate
prune
a
bit
too
subtle
but
not
bad
the
flavor
brings
bright
cracker
and
weak
coffee
generally
weak
in
feel
with
a
medium
light
body
and
fair
carbonation
theres
a
slight
citrus
hop
idea
and
dry
finish
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
interesting
but
kind
of
wimpy
its
drinkable
enough
but
not
something
i
would
necessarily
nominate
for
sessioning
overall
highly
disappointed
with
the
schwarzbier
its
definitely
bier
but
not
schwarz
definitely
didnt
reach
expectations
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
what
i
had
here
was
decent
pour
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
i
definitely
got
some
roastiness
in
the
mix
and
tasted
some
light
hops
but
overall
the
flavor
was
mild
and
uninteresting
i
didnt
dislike
this
beer
but
it
was
rather
dull
the
best
i
had
from
the
brewpub
decent
and
worth
a
look
simple
but
enjoyable
d
drinkable
maybe
slightly
better
than
average
i
would
get
it
again
easy
drinker
with
the
light
abv
d
very
easy
drinking
the
dark
color
may
scare
some
away
who
arent
familiar
with
the
style
but
they
should
really
give
it
a
try
a
good
sipping
beer
tastes
medium
intensity
roast
with
mild
sweet
underneath
roast
is
coffee
and
charlike
with
a
gentle
sour
edge
mild
hop
grassiness
drying
finish
due
to
good
attenuation
and
a
slight
alcohol
cleaning
light
body
but
some
creaminess
modest
carbonation
nicely
hopped
for
the
style
but
a
bit
too
charred
for
the
style
this
is
another
great
beer
at
gb
in
rockville
in
the
german
language
this
beer
actually
means
black
beer
one
would
think
there
would
be
a
heavier
body
but
did
not
come
across
as
heavily
bodied
as
one
would
think
it
had
a
chocolateesqe
flavor
to
it
and
had
a
dark
brown
tint
a
very
good
schwarzbier
definitely
give
it
a
try
goes
down
smoothly
really
a
wonderful
beer
provided
i
pretend
its
a
porter
im
hoping
that
maybe
that
some
malt
that
was
roasted
too
long
went
into
it
ill
try
it
again
with
another
batch
in
a
few
months
to
see
if
thats
the
case
d
excellent
schwarzbeir
the
roasted
grains
and
organic
feel
make
this
top
notch
this
beer
is
pretty
boring
which
i
guess
is
a
fit
with
the
style
i
find
schwarzbiers
to
be
pretty
unexciting
but
this
one
registers
with
me
overall
as
just
sort
of
ok
dark
not
too
roasty
inoffensive
dry
yes
i
just
cant
say
much
about
this
beer
there
is
not
much
here
to
describe
but
there
is
certainly
nothing
off
or
offensive
either
i
dont
know
whether
to
recommend
or
not
i
am
stumped
drinkability
highly
drinkable
dark
beer
versatile
pours
from
the
tap
to
an
old
motor
oil
black
expected
of
a
schwarzbier
with
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
that
lingers
well
thru
the
entire
drink
and
leaves
decent
lacing
the
nose
while
somewhat
muted
is
licorice
and
a
hint
of
roasted
nuts
mouth
is
very
tingly
albeit
a
tad
weak
with
the
taste
again
leaning
toward
licorice
finish
is
of
medium
duration
and
a
little
watery
but
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
great
interpretation
and
really
loved
the
roasted
qualities
in
addition
to
the
more
traditional
flavors
for
the
style
check
it
out
a
pleasant
surprise
from
a
place
that
i
seem
to
go
to
once
every
10
years
would
come
back
to
have
some
more
of
this
beer
this
schwarzbier
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
deep
opaque
sable
with
a
thick
finebubbled
light
tan
head
rich
aroma
is
primarily
of
roast
smoky
malt
strongly
smoky
flavor
has
coffee
nutty
and
caramel
hints
texture
is
smooth
and
has
a
good
strong
tingle
to
it
rather
light
bodied
and
easily
drinkable
crisply
maybe
slightly
overly
carbonated
becoming
creamy
only
after
its
been
swirled
around
the
mouth
a
bit
tm
bold
dark
roasted
malts
up
front
with
sweetness
in
the
background
not
much
carbonation
here
somewhat
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
and
the
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
i
wish
there
was
more
depth
here
poured
dark
mahogany
brown
almost
black
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
foam
lasted
almost
the
whole
pint
and
left
nice
looking
lace
toasted
malt
smell
a
touch
of
smokiness
flavor
of
smoky
toasted
grain
good
balance
between
sweetness
and
hop
finish
dry
and
clean
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
schwarzz
i
have
tried
rated
may

2007
i
enjoyed
this
shwarzbier
and
felt
it
was
pretty
smooth
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
sip
while
watching
a
football
game
after
my
meal
recommended
one
of
their
year
round
choices
the
fifth
in
the
line
of
the
6x
sampler
at
the
rockville
restaurant
this
is
the
one
i
went
to
try
and
while
it
was
good
there
were
a
couple
of
other
pleasant
surprises
in
the
sampler
that
were
strong
competition
for
the
schwarz
the
beer
looked
dark
brown
to
black
in
the
glass
with
brown
and
ruby
highlightslike
a
real
syrupy
coke
slight
head
retention
with
some
bubbles
visible
on
the
sides
as
with
most
craftbrewed
schwarzbiers
ive
tried
lately
the
smell
was
more
stout
than
dunkel
and
while
perhaps
not
on
par
with
the
best
germans
of
the
style
extremly
fresh
tasting
and
enjoyable
nice
roasted
malt
in
the
flavor
and
thats
about
it
nothing
particularly
complex
but
extremely
tasty
and
enjoable
another
one
that
would
go
down
easily
draught
washington
dc
location
this
one
pours
an
opaque
brown
color
there
was
a
tight
offwhite
head
on
it
that
didnt
last
too
long
but
left
some
lacing
there
were
some
roasted
and
caramel
malts
to
the
nose
it
also
had
some
earthy
hop
notes
the
taste
was
along
similar
lines
to
the
aroma
and
was
nicely
balanced
some
roasted
malts
caramel
chocolate
but
no
real
sweetness
earthiness
and
a
touch
of
biscuit
also
perhaps
a
little
nutty
also
nice
a
surprisingly
good
one
enjoyed
at
the
washington
dc
outlet
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
chocolate
malt
light
browncolour
with
a
white
head
creamy
drying
finish
abit
of
sourness
it
all
worked
and
was
very
drinkable
despite
having
a
few
other
beers
that
day
though
none
that
burned
the
palate
perhaps
jason
tinkered
it
well
his
last
day
cheers
the
mouth
could
be
beefedup
a
bit
but
this
is
an
easy
drinker
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
use
as
a
crossover
but
is
it
any
good
or
not
its
a
very
fine
beer
but
i
find
the
malt
character
takes
on
a
clean
caramel
flavor
that
chases
it
through
to
the
finish
this
leaves
the
beer
a
little
sweet
and
less
dry
than
classic
german
versions
the
added
sweetness
allows
the
beer
to
sit
heavy
on
the
toung
and
coats
the
palate
with
the
muted
carbonation
otherwise
great
head
formation
and
retention
with
a
nice
roasted
aroma
flavor
and
a
powdery
sensation
in
the
drinkability
similar
to
dry
stouts
but
cleaner
due
to
lagering
and
lighter
i
was
served
this
beer
from
the
tap
it
was
poured
into
a
nonic
its
very
dark
brown
with
a
thick
dark
beige
head
it
smells
of
toasy
malts
smokey
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
with
scalded
coffee
a
hint
of
wheat
not
much
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
strangea
little
watery
without
much
carbonation
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
that
is
just
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
d
light
bodied
low
abv
and
some
nice
flavor
make
for
a
pretty
sessionable
schwarzbier
d
i
do
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
and
this
was
a
pretty
watered
down
version
it
tasted
like
a
very
light
beer
that
had
just
a
bit
of
black
patent
malt
dipped
in
it
no
much
depth
of
flavor
or
interesting
qualities
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
finger
of
head
that
dissolves
fairly
quickly
no
real
lacing
but
not
a
bad
looking
beer
with
some
nice
brown
highlights
nose
is
mild
roasted
malt
some
smokiness
and
a
hint
of
coffee
very
light
hops
taste
is
likewise
fairly
mild
but
good
if
you
focused
your
energies
smoky
malt
feel
is
medium
to
thin
bodied
but
not
bad
for
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
good
intro
to
the
shwarzbier
style
a
brownish
body
with
small
head
and
little
lacings
dense
beer
that
has
a
slight
coffeesque
smell
but
is
fullbodied
and
not
only
has
a
malty
taste
but
reminded
me
of
an
oatmeal
stout
this
went
down
extremely
smooth
and
was
a
tad
milkysweet
this
is
a
good
beer
and
up
there
with
the
hefe
as
the
ones
to
get
at
this
gb
d
good
but
you
wouldnt
want
too
many
of
these
this
could
be
a
meal
replacement
good
big
old
black
lager
from
gordon
biersch
roasty
coffee
smells
from
a
dark
brownblack
pour
with
some
malty
drying
tastes
light
bodied
like
all
schwarzbiers
despite
the
roasty
character
and
isnt
very
full
bodied
i
thought
this
is
more
a
knock
against
the
style
than
the
particular
beer
though
and
it
is
decent
for
a
schwarzbier
not
my
favorite
but
drinkable
poured
into
regular
pint
glass
by
informed
waitress
jet
black
in
color
with
a
half
a
finger
of
head
laces
remaining
throughout
coffee
aroma
from
the
roasting
but
not
overpowering
quite
smooth
in
the
delivery
to
bely
the
imposing
color
my
first
schwarzbeir
so
i
likened
it
to
a
sweet
porter
an
excellent
batch
and
style
in
general
it
had
a
big
thick
lightbrown
head
upon
arrival
the
beer
itself
was
a
deep
deepbrown
color
with
nequality
clarity
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
nose
had
a
pleasant
charcoal
smokiness
the
mouthfeel
was
thinto
medium
with
a
lightly
smoky
taste
on
the
palate
the
finish
had
a
lingering
smokiness
but
not
necessarily
a
dry
one
as
suggested
by
the
menu
as
it
warmed
i
even
got
a
black
pepper
bite
on
the
finish
had
this
one
again
today
but
never
rated
it
before
poured
a
deep
deep
amber
color
so
dark
it
was
brownish
even
i
was
sitting
in
the
sun
so
it
could
have
cast
a
different
color
anywho
came
with
a
nice
frothy
head
good
retention
taste
was
of
some
cholocloate
roasted
malts
and
something
else
that
i
could
pick
out
decent
beer
d
very
drinkable
not
the
best
dark
beer
they
have
that
would
have
to
go
to
the
winter
bock
but
defiantly
worth
a
try
and
would
not
pass
one
up
if
it
was
offered
to
me
it
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
the
brew
just
not
the
best
one
di
didnt
love
this
beer
but
i
could
have
another
if
i
had
to
the
beer
from
the
tap
a
deep
brown
to
black
with
nice
ruby
highlights
the
head
a
perfect
two
fingers
creamy
tan
in
color
evaporates
slowly
leaving
a
thick
sheet
of
lace
to
obfuscate
the
glass
nose
has
a
toasted
grain
aroma
sweet
with
hints
of
smoke
caramel
maybe
a
licorice
like
tone
mouthwatering
front
has
a
splendid
toasted
malt
presence
sweet
with
a
delectable
hop
spicy
bite
at
the
back
finish
pleasantly
acidic
hops
spicy
and
delightful
dry
lingering
aftertaste
a
great
representative
to
the
style
brownblack
color
with
a
reasonable
head
solid
malts
in
the
smell
most
a
caramel
nice
flavor
with
the
nuttiness
the
food
not
the
personality
coming
through
and
some
caramel
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
again
its
awesome
to
see
lagers
can
have
an
awesome
flavor
profile
mild
hops
medium
body
and
mediumto
light
carbonation
make
this
beer
supersessionable
but
thats
my
bias
keep
this
in
mind
beers
donot
have
to
be
light
crisp
and
hoppy
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
i
tried
this
in
the
july
heat
of
tempe
as
was
very
pleased
and
refreshed
i
received
a
halfliter
of
pitch
blackness
some
lighter
orange
hues
showed
up
at
the
base
of
the
glass
when
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
but
otherwise
this
was
a
nice
dark
beer
as
served
to
me
there
was
little
head
on
it
but
it
did
leave
some
lace
on
the
glass
as
the
beer
receded
the
aroma
evoked
a
strong
roasted
coffee
smell
i
also
got
a
smoky
scent
from
this
beer
as
well
very
appetising
scent
it
tasted
crisp
clean
and
dry
notes
of
roasted
malt
showed
up
prominently
as
did
coffee
and
bakers
chocolate
flavors
some
dark
fruit
flavors
as
well
but
i
had
a
hard
time
placing
them
the
mouthfeel
was
weak
watery
but
with
a
dry
finish
i
would
have
liked
some
more
body
in
this
department
this
beer
deserved
it
still
it
was
an
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
beer
especially
if
you
can
get
past
the
watery
mouthfeel
give
it
a
try
if
you
find
yourself
in
a
gb
one
day
their
beers
arent
great
but
this
one
passes
muster
this
schwarzbier
poured
a
very
dark
nearly
opaque
brownblack
color
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
slowly
settled
the
smell
was
very
modest
with
a
note
of
malt
the
taste
was
mildly
roasted
malty
with
mild
cocoa
and
chocolate
notes
and
even
a
hint
of
malted
milk
and
coffee
the
hoppiness
was
modest
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
finish
was
dry
with
the
moderate
hoppiness
lingering
this
was
a
good
drinkable
schwarzbier
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
this
and
is
a
bit
more
flavorful
than
the
standard
golden
export
offering
from
gb
defintely
worth
having
if
on
tap
i
found
this
to
be
an
interesting
schwarzbier
it
lacked
the
underlying
hoppiness
im
used
to
but
made
up
for
it
with
an
interesting
malt
character
it
was
fresh
which
helped
out
and
tasted
a
little
bit
like
my
most
recent
homebrew
insert
positive
bias
here
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
weak
it
fit
the
profile
of
a
schwarzbier
but
lacked
a
little
kick
that
im
used
to
it
was
however
incredibly
drinkable
and
i
would
stick
to
this
beer
if
i
return
again
to
the
tempe
gordon
biersch
it
was
a
pretty
standard
color
with
the
head
being
very
nice
and
longer
lasting
than
most
lagers
ive
had
overall
its
an
impressive
attempt
but
not
amazing
gordon
biersch
has
a
good
atmosphere
and
brews
some
tasty
beers
on
the
premises
i
had
a
couple
of
pints
of
the
schwarzbier
with
dinner
good
appearance
dark
dense
color
no
light
getting
through
good
size
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
solid
ring
around
the
glass
average
lacing
taste
was
good
malty
smoky
slightly
bitter
but
much
more
subtle
and
light
than
a
porter
or
stout
this
is
a
beer
that
could
be
sipped
or
guzzled
with
equal
enjoyment
nice
rich
mouthfeel
for
this
style
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
look
forward
to
going
back
there
and
trying
their
other
beers
enjoyed
ontap
at
gordon
biersch
brewery
restaurant
before
the
bcs
national
championship
game
in
glendale
az
go
gators
this
beer
is
dark
black
in
color
with
a
finger
light
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
features
dark
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
with
a
lot
of
roasted
malts
and
a
burnt
chocolate
flavor
as
well
lightmedium
body
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
solid
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
deep
mahogany
with
ruby
highlights
and
topped
with
a
cap
of
small
bark
brown
bubbles
eventually
the
head
disappeared
completely
leaving
no
lacing
or
trace
of
its
existence
aromas
of
gentle
spicy
hops
dark
berries
and
longtoasted
bread
the
lightly
spicy
hops
cross
the
palate
first
followed
by
a
slightly
sweet
and
nutty
malt
flavor
that
finishes
with
more
hop
spiciness
mediumlight
body
with
a
smooth
but
crisp
mouthfeel
the
roastiness
stands
out
during
the
middle
but
it
is
the
hops
that
fill
out
the
finish
not
overpowering
in
any
one
area
and
easily
drinkable
the
low
alcohol
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
the
beer
is
dark
but
a
tad
watery
looking
for
this
style
the
head
is
a
foamy
light
brown
from
too
much
carbonation
very
little
aroma
a
tad
burnt
smelling
the
taste
is
dominated
by
stale
coffee
but
very
little
bittnerness
its
thin
and
uninteresting
in
the
mouth
im
glad
to
see
people
try
this
style
which
i
like
but
this
is
mediocre
on
tap
at
dc
location
color
is
a
colalike
dark
brown
supports
a
thin
offwhite
head
with
fairly
good
durability
no
lacing
a
restrained
aroma
of
roasted
malt
toffee
and
some
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
light
and
spritzy
with
a
slightly
watery
texture
in
the
finish
clean
uncomplicated
and
mildly
sweet
flavors
of
dark
roasted
malt
burnt
toast
chocolate
mocha
and
caramel
shows
a
nice
balance
between
the
sweeter
malts
and
more
bitter
acidic
roasted
malt
contributions
a
simple
and
refreshing
beer
which
is
a
nice
rendidtion
of
the
style
in
a
gb
becker
the
pour
forms
a
massice
rocky
two
finger
head
which
falls
slowly
to
a
glass
ring
very
nice
blackruby
when
backlit
the
nose
is
mildly
caramel
sweet
and
roasty
taste
is
a
bit
overly
roasty
not
much
lager
character
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
a
good
mild
drinker
this
beer
is
a
very
deep
brown
almost
black
in
color
very
thin
white
head
disappears
very
quickly
some
roasty
and
toffelike
aromas
dark
malt
slightly
roasty
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
combines
with
some
subtle
earthy
hop
flavor
not
a
sweet
as
i
would
want
light
body
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
carbonation
not
a
bad
exmple
presented
as
a
deep
brown
beer
with
tannish
puffy
head
smell
is
a
nice
combination
of
roasted
malt
and
toffee
taste
adds
to
the
toasty
flavor
with
caramel
and
a
bit
of
sweet
coffee
nice
refreshing
beer
with
a
pleasant
feeling
at
the
finish
very
easy
to
drink
could
be
a
good
session
beer
very
enjoyable
good
black
bier
with
slight
leaning
munich
dunkles
but
tasty
just
the
same
another
fine
beverage
sampled
at
the
washington
dc
location
the
pour
was
a
beautiful
deep
ruby
to
brown
with
the
ruby
highlight
glowing
around
the
edges
the
pour
was
capped
with
a
medium
off
white
head
and
carried
nice
lace
on
the
glass
carbonation
was
medium
to
low
nose
and
flavor
were
big
and
malty
as
designed
the
finish
carried
out
a
vinious
tasting
and
was
wrapped
up
in
a
short
quick
aftertaste
very
nice
beer
very
nice
and
one
of
gbs
better
beers
that
i
have
not
seen
at
their
other
locations
a
shame
since
this
is
my
favorite
regular
beer
of
theirs
schwarzbier
is
almost
black
in
color
with
a
solid
creamy
head
the
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
notable
coffee
aroma
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
dark
roasted
malts
provide
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
schwarzbier
is
very
rich
and
flavorful
but
not
as
heavy
as
its
color
and
taste
would
seem
to
indicate
this
was
the
best
beer
of
the
three
beers
that
i
was
able
to
sample
at
this
gb
i
would
come
back
for
this
brew
alone
smells
of
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
tastes
the
same
light
carbonation
and
smooth
creamy
texture
washed
my
heavy
cake
down
better
than
milk
more
sweet
than
bitter
i
consider
this
schwarzbier
superior
to
my
last
bottle
of
köstritzer
drinkability
very
enjoyable
and
went
very
well
with
their
brats
and
kraut
serving
type
can
an
ok
swartzbier
not
the
best
but
still
ok
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
at
my
first
penn
state
beer
festival
in
2006
and
havent
seen
it
at
ant
other
northern
fests
the
first
beer
i
ever
ordered
on
line
was
a
case
of
this
in
bombers
a
couple
of
years
ago
they
no
longer
ship
beer
my
expectations
were
high
unfortunately
the
reality
didnt
meet
them
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
misses
the
style
just
by
a
bit
could
use
a
little
more
hops
for
balance
a
pretty
decent
lager
that
iwish
i
had
tried
a
little
earlier
in
my
possession
but
still
pretty
tasty
i
would
like
t
try
another
bottle
fresh
o
a
solid
dark
lager
easy
drinking
and
probably
the
right
beer
for
warm
summer
months
as
mentioned
earlier
paired
great
with
brats
homemade
sauerkraut
o
probably
my
favorite
offering
from
the
brewery
and
one
that
i
have
had
numerous
times
before
both
in
bottles
and
ontap
though
before
i
started
actively
reviewing
beers
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
since
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
nice
and
light
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
bubbly
translucent
mahogany
with
a
thick
and
rather
persistent
pale
tan
head
strong
malty
aroma
has
smoky
and
dusty
hops
notes
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malty
flavor
has
a
firm
note
of
woody
hops
rather
like
hay
with
a
caramel
touch
texture
has
above
average
strength
and
fizz
leaving
a
malty
and
woody
finish
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
its
light
thin
at
times
and
under
flavored
all
the
basics
are
there
a
bit
more
flavor
would
do
this
beer
a
great
service
dark
chestnut

not
a

color

foamy

caramel

almost

enough
flavor
upfront
presents

taste
slight

bitterness
in
the
fade
nice
full

overall
there
is
better
out
there
i
hate
to
dis
weeping
radish
but
for
me
the
have
never
been
the
same
since
the
move
from
manteo
i
try
them
each
year
and
it
just
is
not
there
for
me
the
taste
is
good
a
very
nice
lager
with
some
yeast
notes
and
raisin
twang
from
specialty
malts
with
s
subtle
hint
of
green
apple
and
plum
with
a
nice
woody
nuttiness
in
the
flavor
the
caramel
sweetness
seems
to
balance
a
little
of
that
though
the
overall
impression
is
a
good
black
lager
i
remember
the
original
and
this
is
still
a
good
one
although
there
are
many
i
prefer
in
this
style
o
different
but
not
in
an
exciting
way
frankly
the
tartness
is
the
most
noticeable
characteristic
and
its
a
little
distracting
but
it
isnt
unpleasant
either
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
was
drunk
with
food
which
helped
temper
the
beer
a
bit
i
finished
it
easily
but
will
cross
it
off
my
list
for
future
trips
to
the
store
o
overall
a
good
beer
with
a
full
flavor
not
to
familiar
with
the
shwartzbier
style
and
not
to
bad
to
me
the
more
i
drink
i
get
a
chocolate
flavor
decent
brown
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
black
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
andor
hoping
for
but
still
drinkable
if
i
scored
it
strictly
against
the
style
itd
get
an
even
lower
rating
at
first
sip
i
taste
and
smell
hint
of
caramel
in
this
light
bodied
dark
lager
it
drinks
very
smooth
and
i
should
emphasize
the
light
body
it
does
not
appear
that
it
would
have
as
a
light
a
body
as
it
does
the
light
body
also
seems
to
give
it
a
mild
flavor
there
isnt
a
lot
going
on
with
this
brew
its
simple
refreshing
and
somewhat
unique
because
the
style
is
not
available
at
most
breweries
i
picked
it
up
in
a
22oz
bottle
and
at
4
id
say
it
was
overpriced
i
would
get
it
again
particularly
at
a
better
price
o
a
nice
session
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
year
round
especially
in
the
winter
nothing
really
jumps
out
but
worth
trying
overall
a
good
beer
but
flavor
is
lacking
as
in
diluted
or
watered
down
o
not
overly
complex
but
for
a
sessionable
beach
beer
its
pretty
good
wish
i
had
time
to
stop
my
the
brewery
maybe
next
time
im
writing
this
without
having
read
any
other
reviews
so
im
just
giving
my
initial
impressions
the
beer
looked
very
promising
upon
the
poor
with
a
nice
head
and
a
rich
dark
brownblack
color
however
it
was
fairly
unremarkable
otherwise
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
i
tasted
a
hint
of
a
porter
with
cocoa
and
coffee
but
that
was
about
it
that
said
it
might
be
a
good
session
beer
if
its
not
going
to
be
the
focus
of
the
session
o
i
would
drink
another
overall
i
have
only
sam
adams
black
lager
to
compare
with
but
this
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
sa
a
ver
drinkable
beer
and
certainly
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
d
this
was
not
a
good
beer
the
scent
and
taste
were
dirty
and
not
enjoyable
the
body
was
acceptable
at
best
not
really
worth
drinking
so
drinkability
is
low
this
is
probably
the
worst
of
the
weeping
radish
beers
ive
tried
and
the
others
werent
very
good
definitely
not
recommended
overall
a
decent
beer
but
lacking
in
any
serious
flavor
not
bad
though
d
seems
like
the
draught
versions
are
superior
to
the
bottled
version
too
bad
when
its
fresh
its
one
of
the
best
schwarzbiers
around
overall
a
really
solid
beer
and
one
i
would
not
mind
trying
again
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
too
thin
very
smooth
goes
down
real
easy
drinkability
is
fine
this
would
be
an
ideal

at

the

tasted

the
oxidation
isnt
awful
but
this
beer
is
a
mess
avoid

either
this

this
is

beer
for
me
i
tend
to
dislike
sour
beers
but
that
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
dark
german
lager
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
watery
but
fortunately
not
overcarbonated
so
it
could
definitely
be
worse
overall
impression
i
think
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
to
enjoy
it
is
definitely
a
session
beer
i
like
how
the
malts
are
not
lingering
around
which
makes
you
want
to
have
another
drink
this
is
a
quaffable
german
swarzbier
brewed
to
style
this
was
an
ok
schwarzbier
the
appearance
had
a
thick
little
head
but
it
was
very
bubbly
i
guess
a
little
over
carbonation
the
smell
was
very
malty
with
a
little
hop
spike
along
with
the
strong
malt
smell
was
a
faintness
of
smoke
taste
was
kind
of
like
a
porter
light
chocolate
malt
and
a
smokey
finish
were
the
predominate
tastes
drinkability
was
kind
of
average
nothing
really
stood
out
for
me
its
a
soft
smooth
drinking
beer
but
the
flavors
and
smells
are
not
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
received
this
bottle
from
a
friend
in
nc
that
mentioned
this
one
being
a
little
strange
and
id
have
to
agree
now
that
ive
experienced
it
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
nothing
better
than
a
cold
beer
on
a
hot
summer
night
md
good
mouthfeel
creamy
drinkability
is
fine
a
decent
brew
overall
mahogany
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
fairly
thin
head
that
is
gone
to
a
ring
within
a
minute
good
smell
of
dark
roast
malts
and
a
light
delicate
sweetness
a
touch
of
molasses
is
also
noticeable
taste
is
very
complex
for
such
a
small
brew
some
chocolate
and
toffee
with
an
underlying
nutty
flavor
hints
of
coffee
a
hop
bitterness
is
noticeable
toward
the
end
very
evidently
a
german
variety
a
little
more
carbonation
may
have
helped
this
one
with
its
texture
just
a
tad
thin
becoming
a
little
dry
but
not
crisp
in
the
finish
not
as
big
in
body
as
it
should
or
could
be
aside
from
this
small
quibble
its
still
pretty
easily
drinkable
i
actually
wouldnt
mind
another
bottle
right
now
probably
something
ill
revisit
down
the
line
recommended
i
would
love
to
land
a
few
more
bottles
i
think
this
would
do
well
in
a
heavier
option
maybe
some
oak
againg
though
not
sure
how
lagering
would
be
effected
d
notes
i
feel
like
this
is
a
schwarzbier
more
than
a
dunkel
lager
the
mouthfeel
and
acrid
bitterness
gets
in
the
way

this

drinkability
500ml

a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
almost
opaque
black
with
a
thin
head
that
diminishes
to
barely
a
ring
the
aroma
was
some
dark
malts
slight
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
as
well
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
roasted
malts
and
slight
chocolate
with
a
distinct
wheat
beer
touch
the
beer
is
light
with

this
was
a
moderately
enjoyable
beer
but
not
likely
one
id
try
again
i
enjoyed
this
not
the
greatest

a
very

and
some
roasted

is
a
little
simplistic
and
there
are
better
stouts

still
a
good
beer
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down

offered
again

i
know

is
so
sad
about

with
a

with
a
hint

this
is
a
disappointment
this
is
a
nice
one
dark
lager
to
me
have
always
had
a
nice
balance
of
rugged
roasted
flavour
and
some
smoothness
as
well
and
this
one
is
no
exception
enjoyable
indeed
d
not
bad
im
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
one
though
a
decent
brew
thats
a
bit
outside
the
box
gotta
give
props
to
weeping
radish
for
putting
out
something
offbeat
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
black
and
had
the
smell
of
coffee
the
head
was
not
good
and
went
away
very
fast
it
was
tan
though
while
there
the
beer
was
a
little
sour
tasting
as
have
been
all
the
other
bottled
wr
beer
i
have
tried
itt
is
a
shame
as
i
bought
these
right
from
the
brewery
in
nc
so
i
would
think
they
would
be
fresh
and
good
this
is
not
the
case
and
i
guess
they
have
some
kind
of
problem
there
with
cleanliness
i
will
not
buy
again
but
i
will
stop
there
next
time
and
try
the
beer
on
tap
to
see
if
there
is
a
difference
quite
good
nice
session
beer
well
balanced
i
would
certainly
drink
again
the
taste
and
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
this
is
a
very
full
beer
and
one
of
the
best
offered
from
weeping
radish
very
similar
to
a
porter
or
stout
so
dont
let
the
word
lager
fool
you
this
is
a
hearty
beer
and
is
very
well
rounded
im
conflicted
there
are
a
lot
of
stout
going
to
porter
elements
with
a
lager
body
but
it
fits
nicely
it
makes
a
fresher

so
didnt
know
what
to
expect
ive
had
budvar
dark
and
found
it
disappointingly
thin
but
4
9
should
buy
some
more
body
and
backbone
i
feel
that
this
could
be
a
decent
brew
if
better
balanced
i
must
admit
i
did
like
the
label
a
little
more
then
the
beer
inside
the
bottle
im
not
saying
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewer
and
its
a
little
pricey
for
what
it
is
a
very
good
schwarzbier
had
i
not
known
it
was
a
brewdog
beer
i
would
have
guessed
that
it
came
from
a
top
german
brewery
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
brewdog
and
i
will
avoid
this
beer
at
all
costs
in
the
future
d
decent
brew
very
desirable
enjoyed
in
sam
adams
glass
black
with
fast
disapearing
light
brown
head
leaves
lace
spidering
slightly
roasty
slightly
lagerish
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
understated
carbonation
which
is
good
a
little
mollasses
only
slightly
sourish
a
little
drying
decent
interpretation
of
style
light
body
and
carbonation
work
well
with
the
clean
lager
flavours
d
eh
interesting
to
try
but
not
much
here
really
i
was
expecting
more
from
brewdog
i
just
hope
the
punk
ipa
and
others
are
better
this
beer
pours
a
nice
cola
colour
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
that
dissaptes
quickly
with
sporadic
lacingit
has
a
nice
sweet
roasty
malt
aroma
to
it
with
some
bitter
hops
present
aswellit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
roasty
malts
and
some
bitter
hops
towards
the
end
but
not
as
complex
as
i
expected
but
netherless
a
very
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
this
is
not
bad
at
all
and
is
considerably
better
then
some
of
the
brewdog
beers
ive
had
of
late
d
if
youre
comparing
this
with
a
lager
its
very
drinkable
if
you
compare
it
with
other
schwarzbiers
then
this
one
is
milder
lighter
and
sweeter
than
other
ones
this
may
be
right
up
your
alley
if
you
think
schwarzbier
is
to
complex
d
decent
it
get
quite
pointless
after
a
while
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
artwork
on
the
label
milder
and
sweeter
than
most
schwarzbiers
still
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
lager
very
dark
with
little
head
an
little
aroma
but
it
does
taste
rather
lovely
although
drinking
it
straight
after
a
bottle
of
their
outstanding
bashah
it
does
lack
something
in
depth
and
complexity
so
not
one
of
brewdogs
best
yet
still
a
very
fine
beer
and
an
unusual
style
and
why
not
beer
pours
a
dense
brown
nearly
black
body
with
a
slight
off
white
ring
on
the
top
not
thick
or
lasting
aroma
showed
a
slight
citrus
character
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
slight
chocolate
tones
as
well
balanced
with
some
coffee
notes
on
the
tongue
d
very
drinkable
dark
and
accessible
yet
not
mild
in
flavor
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
it
is
at
once
tactfully
stylish
and
tactlessly
brazen
try
it
md
rich
and
creamy
heavy
on
the
palate
which
is
nice
for
this
style
great
medium
carbonation
that
i
could
drink
all
day
went
well
with
dinner
a
heavy
pork
stew
dinuguan
tap
hamiltons
poured
black
could
be
very
dark
brown
with
a
short
creamy
offwhite
head
good
retention
with
small
amount
of
lacing
smoky
burnt
coffee
aroma
with
caramel
cereal
grain
and
tobacco
flattish
mouthfeel
that
varied
between
slick
and
lifeless
very
nice
smoke
and
roast
malt
flavors
earthy
cocoa
like
carab
and
cream
nice
bitter
hops
from
time
to
time
admittedly
i
have
not
had
as
many
schwarzbiers
as
others
but
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
d
a
nice
black
beer
that
has
great
flavour
and
is
real
easy
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
perhaps
the
first
brewdog
i
have
really
liked
aside
from
the
scotchbarrel
aged
stuff
just
wish
it
was
less
expensive
pint
at
beachwood
bbq
for
6
50
tonight
surprised
to
see
this
beer
in
california
under
this
serving
style
great
job
once
again
gabe
on
getting
awesome
beers
in
here
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
34
inch
creamy
slightly
off
white
head
that
does
not
last
long
some
nice
lacing
though
aroma
consists
of
coffee
smokiness
caramel
roasted
malts
raisins
tobacco
toffee
leather
and
very
dark
chocolate
flavor
starts
off
with
some
roastiness
but
is
a
pretty
light
flavor
some
burned
malts
in
the
middle
leathery
finish
with
some
dryness
from
strong
coffee
does
not
change
much
as
it
warms
pretty
light
overall
for
the
style
would
expect
a
bigger
roasty
presence
dry
chewy
and
slightly
roasted
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
medium
level
of
carbonation
taste
did
not
linger
long
and
it
was
thin
at
times
could
drink
another
glass
or
two
light
and
cannot
taste
any
alcohol
not
a
real
flavorful
beer
though
which
is
unusual
for
the
style
drinkability
is
there
but
overall
feel
and
taste
is
lacking
a
bit
not
a
bad
beer
probably
would
not
pay
nine
dollars
a
bottle
like
i
have
seen
it
at
a
few
places
still
a
decent
brew
from
the
uk
might
drink
again
worth
trying
this
is
not
really
a
schwarzbier
more
of
a
strong
beer
along
the
lines
of
eisbock
barleywine
or
doppelbock
only
that
it
has
none
of
the
alcohol
fruitiness
or
carmel
notes
of
these
beers
so
overall
not
too
bad
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
in
many
ways
not
what
it
claims
to
be
but
also
not
what
it
aims
to
be
d
nothing
mindblowing
but
decent
beer
that
id
drink
again
and
could
have
a
few
of
in
a
winter
session
this
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
few
of
brewdogs
heftier
ris
offerings
only
dialed
back
in
intensity
and
definitely
in
weight
ive
come
to
expect
schwarzbiers
to
be
thin
mild
dark
lagers
but
this
far
exceeds
my
expectations
admittedly
borne
of
limited
experience
with
the
style
this
is
a
nice
enough
beer
which
packs
plenty
of
flavour
for
its
average
abv
um
pretty
bland
when
all
is
said
and
done
especially
for
the
price
tag
not
on
par
with
the
calibre
of
this
brewery
otherwise
an
unintimidating
dark
beer
for
those
looking
for
a
stepping
stone
into
the
style
taste
is
roasty
with
nice
maltbitterness
this
is
like
a
dark
pilsner
with
the
dark
malts
adding
a
strong
dark
taste
the
light
body
of
the
beer
seems
to
be
a
little
out
of
balance
by
the
roast
drinkability
is
a
little
inhibited
by
this
mouthfeel
is
a
bith
thin
and
watery
yet
smooth
enough
to
please
the
palate
and
soften
the
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
schwarzbier
definitely
recommended
a
nice
rounded
body
makes
it
a
satisfying
drink
which
is
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
imbibe

on

with
a

and
fizzy

a

mild
though
what
flavors
there
are
nutty

are
pleasant
enough
except
for
the
high

this
could
be
a
legitimate
session
ale
overall
this
is
not
something
i
would
buy
over
and
over
but
its
a
nice
beer
to
sip
while
maybe
smoking
some
nice
herb
im
in
or
its
legal
a
decent
brew
that
would
please
a
newcomer
to
craft
brews
i
was
expecting
an
aggressive
black
ale
so
that
didnt
work
out
for
me
lol
this
was
like
a
sheep
in
wolves
clothing
to
me
intimidating
exterior
but
tame
and
mild
in
reality
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
what
i
was
looking
for
either
overall
pretty
good
black
lager
scharzbier
especially
condsidering
the
style
its
a
difficult
style
to
pull
off
imo
because
it
doesnt
quite
excel
in
any
particular
area
this
one
has
some
uniqueness
and
its
undoubtedly
due
to
the
ale
yeast
used
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
but
definitely
something
to
try
if
readily
available
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
approaching
this
one
and
i
clearly
didnt
read
the
description
on
the
bottle
which
clearly
identifies
it
as
being
a
modified
schwarzbier
as
opposed
to
the
cda
i
was
anticipating
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
far
from
it
while
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
schwarzbiers
and
theyre
not
my
favourite
style
especially
in
the
dark
category
this
one
is
enjoyable
i
was
wary
as
i
began
my
decent
into
it
but
by
the
finish
it
demonstrated
something
i
didnt
even
know
i
was
looking
for
tasty
try
it
appearance
is
a
very
dark
brown
color
supporting
a
healthy
dissipating
head
leaving
nil
lace
smell
of
the
roasted
malt
with
slight
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
of
the
roasted
malt
giving
it
a
slight
bitter
astringency
with
a
light
sour
note
moutfeel
is
medium
light
with
good
carbonation
this
is
plenty
drinkable
though
a
little
flabby
somehow
if
this
is
a
schwartzbier
its
still
better
than
most
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
central
market
shoreline
in
north
seattle
overall
a
drinkable
winter
beer
in
a
category
by
itself
and
wont
compare
to
overbearing
stomach
filling
fancy
spiced
constituents
it
truly
is
one
of
a
kind
overall
this
beer
is
truly
mixed
up
and
does
not
fit
a
style
but
it
is
quite
tasty
i
would
seek
this
one
again
o
a
very
nice
schwarz
not
my
style
but
i
can
spot
a
good
one
and
this
is
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
by
the
books
i
requested
the
style
be
changed
to
properly
reflect
the
style
of
the
beer
its
not
a
cda
or
a
black
ipa
or
as
somewhat
called
it

its
a
german
lager
aka
a
schwarzbier
geez
do
some
homework
people
overall
mediocre
beer
if
you
like
black
lagers
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
want
a
real
black
ale
a
black
ipa
or
a
cda
then
you
should
ignore
this
this
is
a
real
gem
pour

red
edges
and
lots
of

and
a

larger

lightly

a

the

a

towards

was

a

a
good

for

on

this

i
would
be
soaking
it
all
up
i
have
been
around
germany
and
stayed
in
dusseldorf
for
a

and
i
wish
their

were

good

very

almost

pretty
easy
to
get

good

very
drinkable

my

solid
really
good
schwarzbier
that
is
better
than
most
domestic
attempts
at
this
style
that
i
have
had
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
coffee
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
cream
stout
like
but
much
lighter
in
body
i
would
reach
for
this
if
i
was
looking
for
this
style
i
had
never
had
a
black
lager
before
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
was
poured
into
a
half
pint
glass
from
the
tap
at
devils
backbone
outpost
very
nice
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
very
little
head
aroma
was
nice
and
toasty
with
slight
coffee
and
chocolate
hints
mouthfeel
was
light
excellent
stoutlike
flavor
without
being
overly
powerful
a
great
drinkable
beer
with
good
flavor
and
balance
not
bad
but
not
great
more
like
a
stout
then
a
lager
im
not
a
lager
fan
in
general
but
this
is
some
very
good
beer
and
i
love
the
way
it
looks
pretty
good
beer
pours
an
almost
black
dark
brown
moderate
light
tan
head
melts
away
quickly
the
aroma
is
dark
caramel
sweetness
a
light
roasted
malt
note
and
a
little
earthy
hops
its
also
very
light
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
an
interesting
vanilla
note
in
the
middle
the
body
is
lighter
and
there
is
a
little
carbonation
on
the
finish
rjt
eric
o
this
is
the
first
beer
from
these
guys
that
i
didnt
find
utterly
average
its
very
easy
to
drink
yet
with
a
decent
coffee
flavor
id
definitely
drink
this
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
reddish
black
with
a
small
off
white
head
smells
of
coffee
tastes
of
dark
roasted
grain
and
coffee
beer
is
light
bodied
and
good
carbonation
nice
finish
overall
a
very
good
beer
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
from
ye
ole
i
have
only
had
one
devils
backbone
beer
to
date
so
did
not
really
have
any
expectations
also
have
not
had
much
of
this
style
so
not
sure
what
to
expect
or
compare
it
to
love
the
look
of
the
beer
dark
and
clean
very
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
flavor
very
interesting
style
and
beer
a
lot
of
the
aspects
of
a
stout
but
very
drinkable
which
would
make
it
a
session
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
and
would
not
mind
having
again
no
idea
what
a
six
goes
for
but
an
interesting
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
to
share
with
others
my
first
beer
from
these
guys
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
it
tastes
a
bit
stale
like
a
crummy
euro
dark
lager
all
extracty
and
weird
dark
in
color
more
like
a
porter
in
looks
than
a
dark
ale
rather
dense
and
not
super
heady
after
the
initial
gush
fades
down
a
nose
of
tale
dark
roasted
grain
and
lager
yeast
nothing
seems
alive
or
fresh
about
it
flavors
are
all
muted
and
the
yeast
is
just
weird
i
have
heard
these
guys
make
some
great
stuff
but
this
is
a
pretty
uninspiring
introduction
to
this
brewery
lacking
the
nice
carbonation
and
quick
finish
of
the
better
schwarz
types
and
not
really
giving
me
much
grain
character
at
all
it
makes
me
thirsty
for
a
good
one
it
also
seems
a
bit
thick
and
under
carbonated
not
the
feel
i
am
really
after
in
the
style
all
up
there
is
nothing
particularly
bad
about
it
but
it
just
never
really
comes
together
something
with
the
yeast
i
think
but
this
one
is
forgettable
for
me
this
beer
went
do
very
easy
almost
too
easy
i
could
see
why
sitting
around
a
table
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
a
number
of
these
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
really
black
and
it
poured
a
nice
head
the
beer
smelled
like
beer
sorry
the
beer
had
a
malty
taste
and
was
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
would
certainly
buy
this
beer
again
this
seems
to
be
a
good
beer
company
pours
into
my
schwarbier
glass
a
deep
cola
color
with
a
light
beige
head
sitting
perfectly
atopjust
a
great
pour
aromas
of
chocolate
and
earth
with
light
roast
not
overpoweringsmells
like
a
great
dessert
beer
chocolaty
sweet
flavors
but
not
overly
sosome
more
brown
sugar
comes
into
play
giving
more
sweetness
but
a
big
earthy
backbone
keeps
the
sweetness
from
taking
overroast
is
bigger
as
i
drink
more
but
the
lager
smoothness
holds
thr
to
the
finish
i
like
this
rendition
of
the
styleits
alot
better
than
most
american
versions
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
well
done
schwartz
style
this
must
be
very
good
when
fresh
give
it
a
shot
if
you
come
across
it
overall
not
sure
if
the
metallic
cola
taste
is
an
undesired
element
or
not
but
the
end
result
is
a
brackish
lager
that
has
limited
appeal
very
interesting
very
savory
beer
while
being
rather
light
bodied
toasted
grain
some
burnt
coffee
and
chocolate
savory
on
the
midpalate
faint
bitterness
cleans
up
remaining
flavors
beer
finishes
clean
and
balanced
subtle
but
with
some
great
flavors
that
go
together
really
well
faint
burnt
ends
that
add
to
the
flavor
rather
then
take
away
from
it
a
really
nice
schwarzbier
o
excellent
brew
solid
flavors
and
aromas
nice
dark
pour
very
little
head
smell
is
good
has
a
nice
coffee
flavor
tastes
exactly
what
i
expected
it
to
after
the
smell
but
the
strong
bitter
after
taste
got
me
to
me
it
has
an
almost
coffee
taste
i
cant
pinpoint
the
mix
with
coffee
it
has
but
overall
i
cant
complain
and
would
probably
buy
again
although
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
sweetness
this
is
nonetheless
a
fine
alternative
beer
for
summers
especially
if
you
like
to
spend
yours
eating
charred
meats
and
sitting
around
campfires
until
all
hours
of
the
night
o
certainly
quaffable
but
doesnt
have
much
character
d
a
really
awesome
example
of
a
schwarz
brewed
and
packaged
as
intended
welldone
guys
pick
some
up
if
given
the
opportunity
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
a
great
example
of
what
an
american
version
of
a
little
known
and
often
ignored
german
style
of
beer
the
schwarzbier
im
going
to
have
to
keep
some
more
of
this
on
hand
o
dry
and
smoky
with
some
nice
chocolate
notes
refreshing
brew
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
im
a
big
fan
of
schwarzbier
especially
on
cooler
evenings
in
the
spring
and
fall
would
make
for
a
good
bbq
beverage
o
greatly
enjoyed
this
scwarzbier
maybe
it
was
the
mood
of
a
warm
late
summer
evening
in
the
mountains
but
its
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
as
this
one
seemed
to
have
more
character
than
most
schwarzbiers
ive
had
and
maybe
blurred
what
i
expected
from
the
style
a
little
bit
a
solid
and
satisfying
easy
drinking
beer
it
probably
could
use
just
a
bit
more
body
or
fruits
to
give
it
more
oomph
but
it
still
is
pretty
tasty
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
so
far
a
good
sessionable
beer
to
go
with
food
since
it
wont
fill
you
too
much
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
schwarz
but
nothing
mind
blowing
or
something
i
would
desperately
pickup
again
i
would
drink
this
again
with
no
problem
if
i
had
a
choice
this
beer
is
okay
maybe
db
is
targeting
mass
appeal
but
to
me
this
is
on
the
b
list
its
very
drinkable
and
would
make
for
an
easy
session
definitely
better
than
the
macros
but
a
bit
of
a
let
down
for
those
with
a
more
adventurous
taste
on
tap
the
brewpub
pours
black
with
a
sturdy
light
mocha
head
that
rings
the
sides
with
rich
swathes
of
lace
smells
floral
and
green
with
citric
hops
this
blends
in
with
a
combo
of
cocoa
powder
and
some
sweeter
toffee
flavors
while
a
firm
roastiness
shores
up
the
back
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
smooth
blend
of
cocoa
caramel
dark
malts
and
a
crisp
citric
bite
that
leaves
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
roast
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
clean
and
tight
feel
all
around
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
better
schwartzbiers
ive
had
lately
poured
a
blackish
body
with
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
took
forever
to
die
and
left
sticky
lace
hearty
roasted
malt
aroma
with
good
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
some
caramel
and
i
dont
pick
up
too
much
of
a
hop
presence
but
its
there
light
to
medium
bodied
and
easily
passes
the
tongue
but
not
watery
a
touch
of
fluffy
yeast
for
that
fuller
bodied
sensation
but
mostly
an
easy
passer
taste
is
mostly
the
malts
a
good
balance
of
roasted
malts
and
bready
dark
chocolate
with
some
caramel
and
a
nice
if
not
equal
job
done
by
the
hops
for
balance
and
a
little
citric
hop
flavors
in
there
not
the
most
flavorful
or
exotic
beer
one
is
going
to
find
but
this
hits
all
the
basic
attributes
just
fine
and
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
one
can
relax
with
o
i
was
actually
a
bit
thirsty
before
taking
my
first
few
sips
and
this
actually
quenched
my
thirst
im
hoping
this
one
sticks
around
during
the
fall
this
would
make
a
nice
addition
to
my
annual
halloween
party
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
overall
with
a
good
roasty
flavor
and
nice
drinkability
nice
complex
flavors
one
to
seek
out
o
this
is
not
the
most
robust
beer
but
i
believe
it
works
as
a
nice
session
beer
its
warm
and
refreshing
with
a
grainy
profile
that
is
nice
to
sip
drinkability
this
beer
was
extremely
quaffable
and
very
flavorful
one
of
the
better
beers
during
my
visits
to
the
brewpub
drinkability
just
not
a
very
flavorful
beer
which
is
a
big
knock
in
my
book
however
given
that
this
generally
is
not
considered
to
be
a
very
flavorful
style
in
my
opinion
at
least
and
i
know
there
are
likely
many
who
disagree
perhaps
my
palette
is
simply
not
refined
enough
i
cant
necessarily
knock
it
too
much
at
4
9
abv
its
also
not
terribly
unquaffable
regardless
of
the
flavorquotient
its
worth
a
try
once
but
like
with
so
many
dbb
brews
im
not
sure
if
id
come
back
for
a
second
glass
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
roasted
malts
taste
is
smooth
roasted
malts
some
hints
of
chocolate
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
an
easy
drinking
and
solid
beer
probably
my
favorite
from
bayou
teche
tasty
roasty
brew
a
pleasantly
very
solid
porter
overall
a
nice
balance
of
flavor
and
easy
drinkability
overall
a
real
nice
refresher
doesnt
quite
remind
me
of
schwarzbier
but
a
solid
dark
ale
if
there
was
one
o
satisfying
and
recommended
tasty
seems
a
bit
porter
like
at
first
but
easy
enough
to
drink
comes
around
i
had
this
beer
during
a
recent
trip
to
new
orleans
when
i
first
ordered
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
more
stout
like
and
heavy
good
for
sipping
but
not
something
you
want
to
drink
when
its
hot
and
humid
outside
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
upon
my
first
sip
the
beer
was
light
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
there
was
a
nice
nuttiness
to
it
with
a
slight
bit
of
hops
overall
a
good
dark
beer
to
drink
during
the
summertime
also
since
when
is
a
schwarz
an
ale
o
pretty
decent
schwarzbier
that
strange
aroma
is
something
that
ive
encountered
in
other
bayou
teche
beers
as
well
as
some
of
lazy
magnolias
i
wonder
if
these
breweries
use
tap
water
to
brew
and
its
similar
since
theyre
within
150
miles
of
each
other
or
it
could
be
the
yeast
puzzling
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
black
with
a
finger
length
light
tan
head
the
beer
smells
like
dark
roasted
malt
and
toffee
very
straightforward
the
taste
follows
the
nose
you
get
the
toffee
and
dark
roasted
malt
and
not
much
else
thats
not
a
bad
thing
its
pretty
tasty
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
like
a
sessionable
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
o
this
one
is
quite
refreshing
but
i
expected
a
little
more
of
a
malt
presence
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
small
snifter
off
white
head
low
retention
on
a
dark
ruby
but
clear
body
minimal
lacing
aroma
includes
caramel
coffee
roasted
malts
and
some
nuttiness
taste
follows
suit
with
some
bitterness
in
front
then
yielding
to
the
other
flavors
pretty
tasty
and
quite
easy
to
drink
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
brown
with
a
bit
of
see
through
amber
really
nice
roasted
malt
and
coffeechocolate
aromas
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
but
its
still
pretty
good
definite
coffee
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
but
its
all
mild
but
a
little
more
in
the
aftertaste
its
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
still
easy
to
drink
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
and
worth
a
try
nice
to
see
a
dark
beer
from
a
louisiana
brewery
à
votre
santé
overall
not
bad
nice
to
see
something
like
this
come
out
of
louisiana
edit
after
making
it
through
half
the
glass
and
eating
some
food
the
beer
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
perhaps
i
was
a
little
harsh
bumping
the
mouthfeel
from
1
5
to
2
0
accordingly
its
still
not
great
but
its
drinkable
rjt
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
in
the
league
of
some
of
the
best
schwarzbiers
our
there
o
liked
some
aspects
more
than
others
complexity
was
a
fresh
breath
of
air
in
this
style
i
love
but
crisp
hops
werent
there
would
visit
again
perhaps
next
time
on
draft
if
possible
pours
a
deep
brown
color
that
when
held
to
the
light
reveals
rich
ruby
hues
in
the
body
a
thin
one
centimeter
layer
of
khaki
head
formed
it
slowly
dissipated
to
a
ring
of
frothy
bubbles
around
and
numerous
legs
through
the
surface
of
the
liquid
the
aroma
is
of
grain
a
german
yeastfunk
faint
caramel
malt
and
a
cinnamon
apple
think
an
apple
crisp
note
on
the
finish
very
intriguing
and
inviting
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
the
yeast
and
malt
making
a
pronounced
appearance
in
the
front
followed
by
various
grains
some
caramel
and
the
same
cinnamon
apple
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
on
the
tongue
but
a
bit
resinous
on
the
finish
overall
an
enjoyable
and
refreshing
brew
that
did
well
to
break
up
the
clutter
of
stouts
and
porters
released
this
time
of
year
overall
definitely
la
31s
best
offering
goes
down
easy
this
was
a
favorite
at
the
top
of
the
hops
fest
in
jackson
id
drink
another
good
brew
bayou
teche
overall
i
like
it
ok
nothing
to
really
complain
about
but
nothing
to
compliment
on
either
roasted
flavor
is
good
so
its
worth
a
try
also
would
probably
make
for
easy
drinking
in
a
session
overall
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
that
bayoue
teche
has
done
thus
far
nothing
phenomenal
its
easy
drinking
and
tasty
overall
ill
admit
a
lot
all
of
why
i
got
this
was
for
the
name
but
it
didnt
disappoint
if
rick
moranis
ever
drops
by
id
gladly
share
this
with
him
even
measures
of
course
after
all
your
schwarz
is
as
big
as
mine
got
a
bottle
of
this
in
charleston
sc
at
the
brewery
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
though
not
bad
lots
of
rye
and
spices
some
bread
grains
wheat
and
toasted
malts
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
with
their
other
offerings
overall
overall
this
a
well
brewed
and
worthwhile
schwarz
but
it
fails
to
stand
out
to
much
the
flavors
are
just
a
little
lacking
to
really
stand
out
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
the
real
highlight
of
th
ebeer
really
tasty
enjoyable
dark
light
lager
pours
what
looks
to
be
an
ebony
black
but
is
actually
a
clear
deep
brown
with
garnet
hints
when
held
to
the
light
producing
1
5
fingers
of
frothy
but
mostly
tightly
bubbled
somewhat
lasting
dark
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
solid
cap
leaving
only
a
12
inch
of
collar
lace
aroma
is
chocolate
dark
roasted
malts
fresh
cut
pumpernickel
toffee
caramel
a
hint
of
smoke
only
a
faint
hint
of
dark
fruit
rye
is
weak
taste
is
similar
with
the
addition

received
a
22oz
bottle
dated
sep
2014
in
a
recent
trade
really
enjoyed
this
roasty
and
malty
lager
from
westbrook
near
black
body
appearing
mahogany
at
the
edges
small
tan
collar
that
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
in
its
wake
aromas
of
chocolate
char
smoke
though
not
on
the
level
of
a
rauchbier
dark
toast
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
lager
yeast
and
rye
bread
come
in
mid
to
late
palate
solid
very
nice
brew
that
i
hope
to
revisit
again
soon
overall
very
interesting
and
pleasant
brew
o
good
easy
drinking
brew
one
i
would
suggest
for
people
that
need
a
gateway
to
dark
beer
drinking
very
smooth
and
silky
i
enjiyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
lots
of
choc
and
smoky
notes
and
dark
color
with
a
medium
body
that
imply
this
will
be
a
much
boozier
affair
than
it
is
almost
a
session
i
would
grab
one
or
two
of
these
each
fall
or
winter
assuming
they
dont
jack
the
price
been
digging
most
of
westbrooks
stuff
but
the
combination
of
flavors
here
just
doesnt
fit
my
foot
right
weird
average
an
excellent
schwarzbier
with
lots
of
character
well
done
a
lovely
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
pours
almost
black
with
a
thick
head
and
long
lasting
lacing
nose
is
of
chocolate
against
a
slightly
sweet
background
with
a
hint
of
smoke
i
could
not
detect
any
rye
or
hops
in
the
nose
light
medium
bodied
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
balanced
carbonation
typical
of
a
lager
the
taste
is
a
fine
balance
of
chocolate
against
a
slightly
sweet
background
with
a
tick
of
rye
and
smoke
an
undertone
of
coffee
is
also
present
smooth
finish
of
chocolate
with
a
light
rye
spiciness
and
smoke
that
lingers
the
lingering
finish
is
where
the
coffee
flavor
is
most
evident
very
impressive
pours
a
deep
warm
coffee
brown
with
a
thick
and
rather
persistent
finebubbled
tan
head
woody
aroma
has
notes
of
coffee
semisweet
chocolate
hay
and
caramel
robust
flavor
has
bold
coffee
caramel
woody
hop
and
subtle
licorice
and
horehound
notes
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
fizzy
get
your
dark
helmet
on
overall
being
notably
fuller
in
all
its
regards
it
is
not
exactly
a
classic
traditional
schwartz
still
its
a
reasonably
nice
beer
cant
we
just
like
nice
beers
o
so
smooth
exactly
what
i
hoped
for
when
buying
this
brew
well
done
o
really
nice
complex
schwarzbier
just
the
right
amount
of
smoke
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
o
well
not
being
much
of
a
lager
fan
this
could
be
my
favorite
lager
ever
quite
enjoyable
i
wish
some
german
restaurants
around
me
would
have
this
one
on
tap
thanks
doug
i
style
i
like
this
one
somewhat
coffeeish
and
dry
like
an
irish
stout
some
smoke
black
with
reddish
highlights
and
lacy
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
another
good
one
from
westbrook
this
is
my
first
schwarzbier
but
it
fits
the
mold
precisely
it
amazes
me
how
a
beer
can
have
such
roasted
malt
character
but
still
absolutely
taste
and
feel
like
a
lager
charleston
breweries
are
killing
it
right
now
o
very
true
to
form
schwarzbier
glad
to
have
got
my
hands
on
this
at
whole
foods
in
columbia
sc
while
traveling
through
would
like
to
try
more
by
westbrook
overall
well
worth
a
try
o
quite
enjoyable
i
dont
drink
many
in
the
style
but
this
one
is
just
really
easy
drinking
the
rye
gives
it
a
nice
hint
of
spice
that
combined
with
the
chocolate
was
tasty
d
overall
a
nice
beer
not
positive
if
an
infection
is
slowly
showing
its
face
or
not
but
its
so
subtle
it
is
not
completely
taking
away
full
enjoyment
from
the
beer
just
yet
but
still
annoying
enough
to
bother
me
a
bit
overall
a
really
interesting
take
on
the
style
enjoyed
the
hops
the
rye
the
sweetness
and
the
smoky
elements
ark
rich
looking
dark
brown
with
a
small
one
inch
head
of
off
white
that
capped
the
top
of
the
glass
very
very
nicely
before
it
settled
down
leaving
with
it
some
nice
lacing
up
and
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
that
seemed
to
really
thicken
up
and
push
through
as
the
time
went
on
aroma
is
smoked
malts
right
off
the
top
dark
evil
with
hints
of
campfire
peat
dark
roasted
chocolate
and
a
good
bit
of
almost
a
licorice
touch
to
it
as
i
take
the
first
sip
a
rich
and
creamy
feel
overloads
the
senses
wonderful
and
rich
dark
and
foreboding
it
seems
that
it
is
just
meant
to
be
evil
and
dark
loads
of
roasted
and
smoked
malts
just
rolling
across
the
tongue
lightly
dry
finish
leaves
just
enough
room
for
a
small
amount
of
smoky
flavor
to
pop
its
head
in
and
really
give
it
a
nice
solid
finish
great
job
why
is
dark
helmet
good
schwarzbier
is
one
of
those
rather
obscure
styles
that
never
seems
to
get
any
attention
so
it
is
a
great
thing
for
me
that
one
is
being
made
2
hours
from
my
house
this
is
an
excellent
twist
on
a
classic
style
and
one
you
should
try
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
cassino
for
bringing
this
one
to
share
with
me
served
from
bottle
into
a
noda
snifter
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
coffee
toffee
caramel
cream
dark
chocolate
smoke
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
oatmeal
dark
chocolate
coffee
smoke
and
subtle
caramel
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
quite
inviting
and
pleasant
the
flavor
on
this
was
a
little
surprising
as
the
smoke
comes
through
a
lot
more
on
the
followthrough
than
it
does
in
the
aroma
a
definite
must
try
for
fans
of
the
style
or
the
curious
alike
easily
one
of
my
favorite
styles
a
good
schwarzbier
is
hard
to
find
this
one
is
good
but
tends
toward
the
heavier
end
of
the
style
almost
approaching
porter
territory
growler
fill
from
gbx
in
greenville
jet
black
with
a
nice
2
finger
tan
head
spotty
lacing
smell
is
of
coffee
and
figs
not
a
lot
to
the
smell
taste
is
more
in
line
with
a
porter
than
a
schwartz
but
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
different
for
the
style
but
has
a
touch
of
dull
aftertaste
that
is
distracting
perhaps
its
a
growler
thing
but
i
do
like
the
ease
of
this
beer
and
would
consider
it
a
session
beer
notes
of
coffee
and
some
mild
figs
with
some
roasted
malts
on
the
end
with
a
hop
kick
feel
is
more
porter
like
as
well
but
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
on
this
one
overall
a
pretty
good
effort
and
one
i
would
hit
again
it
falls
more
in
line
with
a
porterstout
than
a
schwartz
easy
to
drink
and
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
hop
on
the
end
o
a
very
well
made
beer
that
might
not
please
fans
of
the
classic
schwarzbier
style
but
is
definitely
a
worthy
beer
i
grabbed
a
can
of
their
ipa
just
to
contrast
a
2nd
style
for
westbrook
if
its
half
as
good
ill
be
satisfied
o
tried
at
boones
in
charleston
sc
best
draft
ive
had
under
5
in
south
carolina
definitely
recommend
valuewise
and
brand
new
keg
on
112011
this
a
great
example
of
the
style
malty
toasty
a
tiny
hint
of
smoke
faint
bready
and
sweet
malts
clean
crisp
dry
finish
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
refreshing
balanced
and
flavorful
so
on
point
for
the
style
nice
flavor
not
too
heavy
very
drinkable
pours
brown
with
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
grain
caramel
and
bready
malt
and
some
black
cherries
body
is
medium
and
smooth
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
bread
crust
and
herbal
hops
finish
is
long
and
herbal
semidry
overall
it
is
good
brew
but
taste
more
like
dunkel
than
schwarz
beer
smelled
of
some
sweet
malty
notes
roasted
grains
and
coffee
i
n
the
background
tasted
much
like
it
smelled
and
it
was
quite
enjoyable
would
drink
this
again
and
considering
its
so
local
gotta
love
it
i
tried
looking
for
thier
summer
rental
this
year
im
glad
to
get
the
winter
rental
o
not
bad
a
few
more
ibus
might
cut
the
sweets
o
i
appreciate
the
attempt
at
this
style
as
there
arent
enough
good
ones
domestically
but
winter
rental
doesnt
have
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
would
work
for
those
that
like
the
sweetness
of
a
doppelbock
without
the
thick
feel
clearly
a
lower
tier
and
cheaper
brew
but
surprisingly
good
for
being
such
o
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
it
might
be
a
good
beer
for
when
youre
snowed
in
o
overall
easy
drinkability
sweet
with
a
nice
roastiness
good
enough
for
props
light
enough
for
multiples
its
a
schwarz
people
not
a
stout
and
a
pretty
good
roast
backing
for
one
at
that
i
dont
really
get
any
hop
presence
and
there
is
no
alcohol
to
speak
of
either
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
almost
to
a
fault
not
too
much
going
on
here
and
only
the
faintest
of
roast
malt
on
each
finish
reminds
me
i
am
drinking
a
beer
a
little
disappointed
here
but
wasnt
expecting
to
be
blown
away
anyway
overall
i
might
have
to
see
if
i
can
get
this
again
possibly
fresh
next
winter
release
not
a
bad
beer
overall
pours
a
dark
black
with
clingy
tan
foam
laces
chocolately
malty
smell
some
coffee
notes
taste
is
a
light
creamy
dark
malt
coffee
flavored
very
mellow
little
hop
bite
at
the
close
milky
pretty
good
beer
the
pour
was
as
i
expected
dark
a
bit
of
head
and
nearly
no
carbonation
there
was
virtually
no
lacing
here
either
and
this
had
a
pretty
thin
appearance
and
taste
to
it
lots
of
pumpernickel
and
a
strong
roasted
presence
to
this
but
both
of
those
faded
quickly
after
each
sip
had
this
been
a
bit
more
creamy
it
would
have
reminded
me
of
an
irish
dry
stout
but
theres
just
not
a
lot
here
to
remember
this
was
like
a
flat
soda
without
the
caramel
and
sugary
aftertaste
overall
winter
rental
is
an
enjoyable
beer
this
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
head
fades
away
and
leaving
just
a
small
foamy
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
is
lightly
roasted
with
the
earthy
funk
of
what
most
lagers
have
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
decent
toasted
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
decent
carbonation
also
overall
its
not
a
terrible
brew
its
better
than
i
remember
it
being
the
first
time
i
had
it
picked
up
a
single
from
the
wegmans
in
allentown
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tall
offwhite
head
the
body
is
thicker
and
creamy
like
an
oatmeal
stout
theres
a
little
roast
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
a
hit
of
dark
fruit
and
a
mild
dry
cocoa
flavor
in
the
finish
theres
a
bitter
bite
in
the
finish
a
la
irish
stout
for
a
pleasant
finish
the
midflavor
is
a
little
bland
the
flavors
arent
popping
but
its
still
a
tasty
beer
worth
checking
out
overall
a
decent
session
beer
nice
to
have
on
a
cool
fall
night
as
long
as
you
dont
grab
a
bottle
of
this
expecting
to
get
blown
away
you
will
not
be
dissapointed
consider
this
a
decent
alternative
for
someone
who
drinks
newcastle
but
wants
something
a
little
more
mild
like
i
said
before
an
awesome
winter
session
beer
i
like
it
this
is
a
great
beer
for
when
your
are
not
in
the
mood
for
hops
the
9
abv
adds
a
nice
punch
to
the
liver
it
pairs
well
with
spaceballs
the
movie
which
i
am
enjoying
both
immensely
this
is
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
a
schwarzbier
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
makes
this
very
drinkable
the
appearance
detracts
somewhat
but
still
a
very
desirable
brew
i
first
had
this
at
a
beer
fest
based
on
this
beer
alone
i
made
the
brew
kettle
a
routine
stop
when
im
in
the
cleveland
area
overall
its
quite
a
good
beer
but
it
seems
with
the
addition
of
more
malt
it
lost
some
of
its
smokey
character
i
would
have
loved
it
with
more
smoke
far
different
than
i
expected
this
is
definitely
a
dessertguilty
pleasure
beer
certainly
sweet
very
chocolatey
i
can
understand
why
some
may
not
like
it
but
its
right
up
my
alley
minus
the
metallic
note
overall
tasty
and
somewhat
interesting
a
little
dicey
at
that
strength
though
o
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
thin
porter
great
beer
but
no
lager
will
have
again
dark
fruit
on
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
not
quite
as
cleancrisp
as
i
expected
for
a
black
lager
the
imperial
nature
certainly
bumped
up
the
body
on
this
one
solid
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
a
great
diversion
from
the
ipastoutsour
rat
race
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
like
dark
fruit
flavors
in
quads
missed
the
mark
for
the
style
oddly
sweet
and
lacking
that
roasted
lager
thing
almost
entirely
its
not
really
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
what
it
claims
to
be
and
warming
almost
kills
it
this
is
a
pretty
thick
beer
and
really
everything
about
it
screams
baltic
porter
to
me
i
like
this
one
a
lot
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
layer
of
off
white
head
the
head
goes
away
rather
quickly
the
nose
is
sweet
with
a
smokey
undertone
im
getting
some
dark
fruit
and
a
cocoa
note
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
in
the
flavor
but
i
would
say
that
the
smoke
ends
up
being
the
dominant
taste
in
the
finish
there
is
a
dark
fruit
note
and
a
malt
sweetness
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
a
strong
brown
ale
that
has
had
a
cigar
dropped
in
it
o
interesting
beer
here
i
generally
love
me
some
high
abv
dark
beers
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
but
its
not
something
id
purchase
wish
he
would
have
sent
me
the
white
rajah
o
this
beer
seemed
rather
unbalanced
to
me
with
sweet
cola
and
licorice
really
dominating
the
flavor
profile
as
the
glass
went
on
making
it
rather
cloying
i
would
have
liked
to
been
able
to
enjoy
the
other
flavors
present
and
maybe
seen
more
bitterness
coming
from
hops
though
it
would
be
a
totally
different
style
if
it
even
exists
this
seems
like
what
an
imperial
cream
ale
might
taste
like
if
youre
a
fan
of
really
sweet
beers
or
hey
popsoda
in
general
which
is
usually
too
sweet
for
me
this
one
might
be
worth
your
time
i
remain
curious
about
the
bready
fruity
characteristics
that
many
other
reviewers
noted
but
didnt
seem
apparent
in
my
glass
maybe
ill
need
to
revisit
this
far
off
in
the
future
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
caramel
and
a
small
fruitiness
in
the
taste
a
roasty
note
of
caramel
and
a
fruity
sweetness
a
small
bite
but
mainly
smooth
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
nice
balance
between
the
fruit
and
the
roast
a
nice
body
and
very
enjoyable
o
interesting
flavor
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
black
aleipa
this
is
not
that
still
very
good
smooth
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
fine
schwarzbier
of
imperial
strength
lagers
answer
to
the
imperial
stout
very
tasty
and
worth
the
purchase
i
would
recommend
this
if
you
are
looking
for
an
interesting
sweet

reminds
me
of
the
black
rat
imperial
stout
from
cellar
rats
i
had
recently
a
really
unique
beer
style
to
try
out
but
i
dont
see
myself
getting
this
again
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
had
some
good
qualities
in
the
flavor
but
was
not
very
aromatic
subsequent
drinks
really
show
off
the
balance
could
use
a
bit
more
flavors
for
the
unique
idea
of
an
imperial
schwarzbier

d
i
very
much
enjoy
a
good
schwarz
and
this
is
one
of
them
overall
nice
malty
and
bold
fruity
flavors
really
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
being
such
high
alcohol
the
malts
are
really
present
but
the
downfall
is
the
other
flavors
are
a
little
to
mild
and
forgetable
still
soild
and
a
good
drink
worth
a
try
for
sure
from
the
excellent
brew
kettle
brewery
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
and
it
has
held
up
nicely
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
easy
to
drink
would
like
to
have
it
again
not
quite
mid
bodied
a
little
thin
but
drinks
much
easier
than
the
high
abv
really
not
bad
but
has
the
flavor
profile
of
a
much
smaller
beer
this
has
never
been
my
favorite
from
tbk
but
if
you
like
schwarzbiers
give
this
a
try
because
its
unique
and
not
your
ordinary
i
appreciate
theyre
doing
something
different
with
this
one
i
guess
its
just
not
really
for
me
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
smallish
tan
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
smells
of
light
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
earthy
and
floral
hops
playing
a
supporting
role
taste
is
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
ash
earthy
bitter
hops
mix
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
to
counter
the
malt
sweetness
theres
a
hint
of
melanoid
in
there
that
makes
it
a
little
interesting
a
bit
of
a
lingering
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
i
thought
this
was
only
ok
it
seems
like
a
kicked
up
version
of
a
macro
lager
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
d
a
very
drinkable
offering
from
brew
kettle
i
really
enjoy
dark
lagers
so
it
was
interesting
to
try
an
imperial
version
of
one
of
my
favorite
lager
styles
the
brew
kettle
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
its
not
outstanding
but
its
still
very
good
o
overall
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
beer
big
malty
and
roasty
fine
work
pours
a
very
dark
cola
like
color
with
a
two
finger
dark
khaki
colored
head
which
gives
way
to
some
strings
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
some
roasted
malts
along
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
sweetness
as
well
as
toffee
and
some
dark
chocolate
the
taste
has
a
roasty
and
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
bitterness
there
is
also
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
sweetness
that
rounds
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
it
is
not
slick
with
alcohol
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
it
has
a
good
flavor
but
left
me
wanting
just
a
little
more
out
of
it
it
was
however
very
enjoyable
i
bought
this
beer
at
rozis
in
lakewood
oh
pours
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
style
pint
glass
pitch
black
body
with
a
tan
full
thicket
of
head
i
love
the
name
the
reference
to
space
balls
and
the
quote
on
the
bottle
may
the
schwarz
be
with
you
fine
even
lacing
left
behind
very
nice
look
to
this
beer
aromatics
have
some
up
front
dark
fruit
with
hints
of
toffee
and
coffee
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
much
like
a
baltic
porter
a
big
nine
percent
black
lager
flavor
is
a
warming
roasted
dark
malt
adventure
from
dark
licorice
notes
with
dark
chocolate
bitterness
to
hints
of
fruit
ripened
plum
hints
of
raisin
a
finishing
breeze
of
herbal
hops
overshadowed
by
the
bitterness
of
the
dark
chocolate
nearly
burnt
roasted
dark
malts
mouhfeel
is
medium
to
fuller
bodied
excellent
well
crafted
stuff
coming
out
of
the
brew
kettle
i
cant
get
over
the
quality
of
their
beer
moderated
carbonation
finishes
dry
with
a
nice
balance
their
beers
are
wonderful
go
try
some
of
the
brew
kettle
offerings
i
cant
wait
until
they
bottle
white
raja
ipa
overall
this
is
quality
ive
never
had
another
imperial
schwarzbier
to
compare
this
to
but
this
is
excellent
stuff
pours
nearly
black
though
it
is
still
slightly
see
through
thin
ofwhite
head
forms
at
the
beginning
and
offers
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
with
some
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
coffee
theres
a
touch
of
licorice
there
in
the
background
as
well
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
theres
a
touch
of
roast
and
some
light
coffee
mild
anise
in
the
background
fairly
tasty
though
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
bitter
with
far
too
much
alcohol
for
what
its
carrying
pretty
good
though
the
finish
was
far
too
harsh
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
this
beer
fizzes
on
your
tongue
and
leaves
little
residue
the
carbonation
may
be
a
little
excessive
but
it
does
allow
this
beer
to
be
more
than
a
sipper
surprising
dark
fruitiness
for
a
lager
but
i
guess
sometimes
that
profile
shows
in
a
baltic
porter
touch
of
bittering
hops
meld
with
the
roast
and
make
it
a
bit
biting
on
the
finish
lighter
body
feels
more
lageresque
as
does
a
pleasant
smoothness
drinkability
is
damn
good
for
a
9er
this
beer
grows
on
you
as
the
ounces
pass
and
is
strangely
attractive
and
drinkable

the

has
some
of
the
fruity
notes
of
a
mild

or
dark
ale
but
still
very
good
and
an
interesting
twist
drinkability
not
bad
i
dont
typically
drink
a
lot
of
lagerstyles
but
this
one
definitely
warrants
getting
picked
up
on
occasion
if
the
brew
kettle
continues
to
make
it
it
would
probably
be
a
little
better
in
the
early
spring
or
fall
and
at
9
it
would
need
to
be
a
little
limited
dark
helmet
imperial
schwarzbier
isnt
bad
beer
nor
is
it
especially
good
beer
its
my
least
favorite
of
the
handful
of
the
brew
kettle
brews
that
ive
had
so
far
drinkability
not
a
poor
beer
but
nothing
too
special
either
for
9
abv
i
would
want
a
bit
more
going
on
to
say
it
has
good
drinkability
i
find
it
to
be
pretty
onedimensional
the
taste
is
where
the
roasted
malts
show
up
but
only
a
little
bit
the
first
thing
you
can
taste
is
sweet
flavors
maybe
a
little
bit
of
esters
too
i
could
almost
place
the
taste
as
being
more
like
some
belgian
strong
dark
ales
than
a
dark
lager
but
that
just
shows
how
much
overlap
there
can
be
between
species
the
body
is
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
but
everything
on
the
label
prepares
you
for
that
very
good
not
just
a
gimmick
an
easy
drinking
brew
i
finished
my
glass
with
no
problem
and
was
left
wanting
for
more
a
good
schwarzbier
i
buy
the
beer
just
for
the
label
its
that
funny
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
nice
smooth
medium
body
the
beer
is
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
cloyingly
so
this
is
an
easy
drinking
kicked
up
brown
ale
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
call
this
a
smoked
beer
probably
wont
be
seeing
this
beer
in
my
glass
again
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
brown
with
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
caramel
and
some
coffee
it
tastes
like
dark
fruit
roasted
malt
coffee
nuts
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
booze
mouthfeelbody
is
lowmedium
it
does
seem
a
bit
thin
and
has
lowmoderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
alright
it
is
smooth
and
easy
enough
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
enough
brew
its
not
something
i
would
buy
all
the
time
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
average
was
worried
it
would
be
a
bit
flat
based
on
the
appearance
but
its
ok
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
but
not
the
new
holy
grail
for
schwarz
lovers
not
the
best
schwarzbier
but
worth
trying
nonetheless
i
would
like
to
see
more
balance
less
sweetness
more
roastiness
and
chocolate
notes
would
improve
this
beer
drinkability
an
example
of
what
lagers
can
be
not
just
watered
down
rice
water
but
flavorful
and
nuanced
dark
beer
sampled
may
2008
but
i
forgot
to
upload
my
review
and
this
notebook
has
been
sitting
in
a
suitcase
since
then
mouthfeel
is
thin
medium
bodied
sugary
and
syrupy
in
the
finish
poured
a
deeper
reddishbrown
color
with
a
very
small
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
nuts
roast
and
i
was
getting
some
dark
fruits
tastes
of
chocolate
lighter
nuttiness
raisins
and
plums
this
one
was
very
sweet
not
cloying
but
getting
there
d
not
all
that
great
not
all
that
bad
if
you
like
sweeter
beer
with
heavy
malt
and
yeast
presence
here
ya
go
i
can
see
it
now
imperial
schwarzbiers
are
all
the
new
rage
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
this
beer
did
not
fall
on
a
dry
stout
porter
brown
or
any
other
heavier
concoction
but
it
does
show
a
strong
schwarzbier
character
but
in
an
amped
up
form
muted
aromas
with
a
dry
roasted
character
makes
me
beleive
that
theres
not
much
there
flavors
on
the
otherhand
beg
to
differ
big
clean
roasted
notes
with
a
slight
touch
of
fullyattenuated
caramel
and
a
hint
of
lactose
otherwise
no
fruits
fermentation
byproducts
phenols
sweetness
or
sulfers
just
a
crystal
clean
beer
the
body
seems
higher
but
remains
chalkdry
with
a
soft
roasted
coffee
astringency
that
balanced
the
beer
finishes
quite
the
same
the
flavors
are
the
same
as
good
schwarzbiers
but
the
weight
is
increased
why
not
chocolate
malt
a
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
slight
roasty
component
medium

a

not

too
it
black
beer
is
an
appropriate
name
based
on
its
color
it
is
very
very
dark
sweety
fruit
smell
but
doesnt
really
carry
that
flavor
paired
very
well
with
a
strong
brie
a
little
low
on
the
carbonation
but
for
a
darker
beer
i
can
live
with
it
gelatin
like
head
i
feel
like
i
dont
have
to
say
that
its
black
strong
cherry
and
raisin
scents
i
was
expecting
some
more
roasted
flavor
certainly
has
strong
grape
and
fruity
flavors
finishes
wet
on
the
palate
like
grape
juice
great
brazilian
beer
smells
delicious
with
some
distant
hints
of
coffee
i
can
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
good

my
first
beer
from
brazil
pretty
decent
tasting
this
one
started
well
and
certainly
looked
the
part
but
it
was
a
beer
that
started
to
fade
down
the
straight
and
just
seemed
to
remind
me
of
a
pale
lager
too
much
with
some
skunk
and
grassy
hops
making
themselves
know
and
coming
across
a
little
too
strongly
for
my
liking
i
was
enjoying
it
initially
with
the
darker
roasted
malts
starting
things
off
but
these
flavours
disappeared
far
too
quickly
for
my
liking
and
the
beer
just
seemed
ordinary
and
plain
by
the
end
definitely
better
than
xingu
gold
but
not
a
beer
to
buy
on
its
own
right
overall
a
very
fine
beer
not
too
sweet
and
just
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
better
than
people
give
it
credit
for
being
a
boldly
flavored
and
intensely
roasty
black
beer
but
light
on
the
palate
almost
even
thin
in
body
and
quicker
finishing
for
the
style
its
got
an
almost
lagered
yeast
character
to
it
and
a
pretty
solid
off
white
head
its
clearish
beer
too
which
is
cool
different
and
welcoming
its
a
lower
abv
beer
which
makes
it
drinkable
and
i
think
it
fits
in
all
seasons
i
get
a
dried
fruit
thing
here
not
raisin
but
something
like
it
even
prune
or
plum
in
the
taste
before
the
burning
malt
takes
over
carbonation
is
great
from
the
tap
although
i
have
had
less
impressive
bottle
experiences
i
think
its
one
of
the
more
underrated
beers
in
the
style
and
if
i
was
actually
in
brazil
this
would
be
far
better
than
almost
anything
else
on
offer
the
whole
thing
is
impressive
if
you
take
in
it
context
of
course
its
a
letdown
against
the
schwarzbiers
of
old
world
germany
but
its
not
that
far
off
its
also
very
satisfying
and
refreshing
though
this
is
hands
down
the
best

ive
had

one

for

while

i
first
had
this
in
2008
and
gave
it
a
resounding
meh
it
hasnt
improved
the
best
thing
about
it
is
its
appearance
overall
very
interesting
dont
know
that
id
buy
it
again
but
i
definitely
liked
it
struck
me
as
being
too
sweet
overall
a
sweet
and
easy
drinking
lighter
roasted
black
lager
a
good
darker
brew
for
a
warmer
summer
day
overall
id
say
its
an
okay
beer
but
seems
to
look
a
tad
better
than
it
tastes
or
smells
hard
to
describe
this
i
can
only
think
that
this
must
have
been
a
bad
batch
or
the
water
to
brew
this
in
brazil
is
so
different
than
i
am
used
to
that
it
threw
my
pallet
for
a
loop
i
honestly
equate
this
to
budweiser
brewed
with
funky
water
that
was
my
immediate
reaction
i
will
not
get
it
again
nutty
lightly
caramelized
and
toasted
malt
aroma
with
a
taste
thats
sweeter
than
expected
more
caramel
than
nuts
and
minimal
roast
theres
a
slight
metallic
note
carbonation
is
higher
than
id
prefer
and
it
lacks
roast
for
the
style
not
incredibly
complex
but
very
drinkable
would
be
good
at
a
soccer
match
on
a
hot
brazilian
day
from
bottle
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
nice
head
disappated
quickly
hardly
any
aroma
but
a
full
body
flavor
my
only
issue
is
the
flavors
could
be
brighter
very
fruitypruney
with
a
nice
balance
of
bittersweet
but
it
all
seemed
to
sit
back
on
the
palate
this
ones
just
ok
its
good
for
a
brazilian
beer
but
there
are
tons
of
better
black
lagers
out
there
o
about
what
i
expected
from
an
import
potentially
decent
but
always
has
offputting
characteristics
at
least
the
flavors
brought
in
a
little
surprise
that
wasnt
terribly
bad
pours
a
very
deep
dark
brown
with
about
a
1finger
khaki
head
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
and
more
so
than
other
beers
of
this
type
the
aroma
is
just
mostly
of
roasted
malts
really
the
taste
has
more
going
on
with
the
roasted
malts
coming
through
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
even
molasses
to
it
pretty
smooth
overall
with
perfect
carbonation
like
a
slightly
watereddown
stout
but
very
good
really
no
bitter
aftertaste
to
mention
overall
its
a
good
brew
o
drinking
it
on
a
warm
spring
day
nice
alternative
to
an
aal
for
session
drinking
decent
very
for
one
nothing
in
the
beer
or
its
packaging
suggests
unique
ingredients
as
for
its
roots
the
beers
website
tells
a
slightly
different
story
though
it
apparently
still
contributes
to
several
charity
initiatives
despite
now
being
owned
by
latin
americas
largest
beverage
company
bottom
line
xingu
certainly
isnt
as
exotic
as
its
made
out
to
be
its
an
ok
black
lager
at
best
this
does
not
get
high
ba
ratings
but
at
the
same
time
xingu
was
one
of
those
different
beers
that
taught
me
there
was
more
to
the
world
of
beer
than
the
american
pale
lagers
i
drank
in
70s
and
80s
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
this
beer
goes
way
back
in
the
craft
beer
movement
i
remember
going
to
all
kinds
of
random
establishments
20
years
ago
that
might
not
have
much
but
might
have
this
beer
its
really
not
bad
at
all
as
long
as
you
arent
looking
for
intense
flavors
or
a
stout
like
experience
it
is
somewhat
thin
and
somewhat
simple
but
its
redeeming
features
are
its
subtle
roastiness
and
especially
its
slightly
nutty
graininessgrassiness
reminds
me
of
wild
rice
that
adds
an
interesting
note
pleasant
enough
once
in
a
while
overall
pretty
nice
alternative
to
a
stout
and
porter
very
enjoyable

o

find

i
would
recommend
this
one
as
it
is
full
of
flavor
smooth
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
show
at
all
i
would
buy
this
again
and
feel
it
would
work
well
with
a
meal
and
holds
it
own
too
solid
beer
easy
to
drink
and
has
more
flavor
then
i
expected
i
wouldnt
look
for
it
but
id
drink
it
again
o
looks
pretty
good

and
makes
me
feel
like
poop
poured
this
12

into

glass
poured
a
dark

produced
a
thick

left
some

the

consists
of
citric
lemon
dark

coffee
chocolate
and
roasted

medium

not
really
a
traditional
schwarzbier
but
it
is
worth
a
try
the
flavor

consisted
of
roasted
malt
slight
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
it
was
a
little
thin
overall
decent
not
great
not
bad
though
could
be
less
sweet
and
the
adjunct
plus
caramel
addition
does
not
help
o
a
good
beer
that
lack
the
thickness
of
flavor
of
other
black
beers
but
still
a
good

o
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
overall
much
much
better
than
expected
at
a
brazilian
resteraunt
with
only
crap
american
macros
this
beer
pleasantly
surprised
me
as
i
somehow
in
my
prejudiced
mine
expected
a
weak
and
lessthanaweinspiring
beer
well
ive
been
wrong
before
just
ask
my
wife
this
is
a
very
pleasing
robust
and
satisfying
dark
brew
this
is
a
very
maltforward
beer
with
a
near
perfect
touch
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
bold
and
complex
in
a
very
pleasant
way
recommended
gratingly
sweet
the
apparently
low
proportion
of
black
maltbittering
hops
leaves
this
with
a
rather
hollow
flavor
this
is
definitely
not
what
percy
fawcett
was
searching
for
this
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
it
reminds
me
of
sweet

good
looking
beer
though
nice

almost
no

nice
balance
between
sweet
and
roast
went
well
with
the
multiple
meats
at
the
brazilian
steakhouse
in

o
this
is
the
first
brazilian
beer
ive
ever
had
its
drinkable
but
pretty
sweet
i
would
buy
it
if
i
was
in
brazil
but
there
are
better
black
lagers
around
overall
i
like
this
brew
but
definitely
doesnt
blow
my
mind
away
i
definitely
wont
knock
it
its
almost
like
a
milk
stout
meets
your
black
lager
salud
when
poured
this
beer
has
a
black
as
night
body
with
a
2
tan
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
couple
of
minutes
then
lays
down
to
a
thin
lace
the
aroma
has
a
some
chocolate
to
it
and
also
some
malt
coming
through
also
the
taste
has
a
sweet
flavor
like
semi
sweet
chocolate
also
get
a
hint
of
malt
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
overall
im
not
impressed
by
it
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
may
to
get
it
again
overall
a
decent
session
beer
poured
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
this
beer
smells
and
taste
kind
of
like
a
light
stout
it
has
the
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
but
they
are
not
rich
still
this
beer
taste
good
and
is
easy
drinking
the
bitterness
from
hops
is
also
present
but
this
flavor
is
also
very
mild
a
good
choice
for
someone
who
likes
the
stout
flavor
with
a
light
body
and
flavor
profile
not
a
bad
import
pretty
good
if
not
the
most
exciting
brew

a
try
to
the
point
a
nice
black
lager
worthy
of
trying
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
nothing
exceptional
but
it
is
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
since
my
college
graduation
when
i
initially

there

beer
but
i
rather
dont
mind
this
at

o
this
tastes
like
a
maltier
richer
version
of
a

that

about

not
the

ive
had
odnot

also
the
nose
is

nothing
who
would
have
thought
a
brazilian
schwarzbier
wouldnt
be
excellent
a
solid
malty
beverage
not
awe
inspiring
but
certainly
drinkable
and
interesting
enough
with
the
low
abv
it
could
be
a
solid

beer
feel
is
approaching
medium
but
not
quite
there
yet
the
carbonation
is
low
making
for
an
easier
ride
down
this
kinda
coats
the
mouth
real
quick
and
leaves
even
quicker
i
drank
my
bottle
over
a
long
period
of
time
i
was
just
not
that
interested
in
it
its
ok
beer
but
that
south
american
taste
is
there
and
well
its
just
there
one
and
done
o
very
smooth
black
lager
there
wasnt
a
ton
of
aroma
or
flavor
but
it
was
rather
simple
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
strange
and
unique
little
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
despite
some
flaws
there
is
definitely
something
unique
in
the
taste
south
american
water
that
i
havent
found
elsewhere
would
buy
again
when
in
the
mood
drinkability
its
a
very
light
and
smooth
schwarzbier
decent
and
very
drinkable
but
almost
like
a
soda
to
me
well
it
looks
the
part
but
it
falls
short
on
flavor
the
applelike
acetaldehyde
off
flavor
is
overwhelming
and
the
roasted
malt
character
is
underwhelming
overall
its
not
worth
a
try
unless
like
me
you
just
want
to
try
your
first
beer
from
brazil
the
body
was
mostly
clean
and
crisp
but
did
have
a
bit
of
a
sticky
finish
drinkability
was
good
but
i
tend
to
like
this
style
overall
a
fairly
average
example
of
the
style
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
or
if
like
me
you
need
to
tick
brazil
off
your
countries
list
o
the
low
alcohol
and
neutral
nature
makes
this
a
very
quaffable
dark
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
doesnt
usually
enjoy
stouts
porters
etc
nothing
too
exciting
but
worth
a
try
despite
smelling
like
a
stale
american
macro
xingu
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
but
forgettable
schwarzbier
i
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
in
the
states
but
would
consider
buying
it
as
a
solid
drinker
this
summer
if
i
can
find
it
in
ecuador
o
interesting
and
unique
beer
but
nothing
pops
out
to
me
as
excellent
i
bet
this
review
would
change
for
the
better
if
i
had
it
on
tap
in
rio
o
an
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
black
beer
with
a
fine
mouthfeel
but
a
weak
aroma
o
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
schwarzbier
that
fits
right
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
for
the
style
no
quality
of
this
beer
really
stood
out
but
the
flavor
was
pleasant
and
light
enough
to
allow
for
enjoyment
in
numbers
although
this
brew
wouldnt
be
my
preference
for
the
style
i
still
think
its
worth
a
look
i
did
not
really
enjoy
this
beer
just
came
up
short
for
me
d
really
enjoyable
brew
i
find
this
mostly
maltcentric
but
it
is
certainly
not
overpowering
this
is
a
different
beer
its
not
bad
by
any
means
though
i
probably
wouldnt
kick
any
of
my
current
regulars
out
to
make
room
for
it
in
the
rotation
certainly
worth
checking
out
if
you
are
looking
to
explore
a
little
bit
the
comparisons
on
here
tend
to
be
to
a
black
lager
and
i
definitely
see
that
give
it
a
try
rjt
im
glad
to
have
tried
a
brazilian
beer
for
the
first
time
though
there
was
nothing
about
this
one
to
commend
another
o
my
first
beer
from
brazil
interesting
to
switch
it
up
a
bit
from
the
norm
it
reminds
me
of
a
black
lager
and
i
liked
it
better
than
guinness
black
lager
overall
an
acceptable
representation
of
the
style
not
stellar
but
enjoyable
a
good
intro
to
dark
beers
for
someone
thats
not
into
stouts
yet
o
i
dont
know
if
i
could
place
a
grassy
taste
as
a
must
try
this
was
a
different
taste
but
i
doubt
i
will
try
this
again
not
horrible
but
not
too
much
enjoyable
either
its
smooth
and
more
made
for
an
inexperienced
drinker
to
enjoy
o
i
expected
this
be
a
little
more
bold
with
its
flavors
considering
how
dark
it
is
and
all
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
underwhelming
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
slight
light
brown
head
scent
has
sweet
carmel
malts
and
sugars
taste
has
a
good
mixture
of
sweet
carmel
malts
and
robust
malts
flavor
is
bold
and
has
a
decent
texture
but
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
with
a
little
bit
of
a
chalky
after
taste
a
rather
interesting
version
of
a
schwarzbier
overall
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
i
think
it
lacks
body
and
a
more
bold
coffee
taste
that
i
hoped
to
find
but
either
way
i
like
this
beer
from
brazil
my
buddy
and
i
used
to
refer
to
this
beer
as
amazon
swamp
water

there

must

is
a

a

sour
black
with

all

i
dont

how

much

26
for
those
who
have
tried
ziegen
bock
thats
what
this
reminded
me
of
only
without
the
pleasant
carbonation
its
a
thin
underwhelming
beer
and
its
only
redeeming
quality
is
that
it
isnt
assertive
enough
to
be
offensive
just
meek
and
forgettable
if
youre
looking
for
some
of
the
characteristics
in
a
porter
but
want
something
easy
drinking
this
is
a
good
beer
to
grab
its
chocolatey
sweet
a
hint
of
banana
with
a
roastedsmokey
character
ended
with
a
lightly
hopped
finish
this
unheralded
treat
from
brazil
went
well
with
my
honey
bbq
wings
some
might
say
its
too
sweetout
of
balance
but
it
worked
for
me
so
i
had
to
try
this
because
it
is
brazilian
luckally
i
was
able
to
buy
just
one
at
a
time
what
a
thick
syrupy
beer
it
really
tasted
good
like
chocolate
malt
or
something
and
really
filling
i
felt
like
i
should
have
drank
this
for
dessert
after
a
meal
i
think
if
i
would
have
drank
more
than
one
it
would
have
been
overkill
but
definitely
a
good
sipper
smelled
good
too
but
maybe
mine
was
a
little
stale
due
to
sitting
on
a
shelf
unrefrigerated
i
cant
imagine
there
is
a
huge
demand
for
this
stuff
i
swear
this
is
cokeflavored
beer
it
pours
a
light
black
color
with
an
amber
tint
if
held
in
the
light
head
is
thin
but
retention
and
lacing
are
good
roastedmalt
aroma
and
taste
with
a
syrupy
texture
my
first
thought
was
of
a
fountain
soda
its
a
little
watery
with
low
carbonation
but
easy
to
drink
i
only
have
one
bottle
and
i
have
to
keep
slapping
my
hand
away
to
stop
from
ripping
through
it
easily
sessionable
ill
pick
of
few
more
of
these
up
for
sure
notes
what
a
well
rounded
beer
from
start
to
finish
as
it
warmed
the
smoked
backside
comes
in
to
play
more
and
makes
this
even
better
da
odd
for
the
style
but
enjoyable
and
interesting
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
sudsdog
for
letting
me
sample
this
interesting
brew
im
also
not
sure
that
it
is
worth
the
value
in
the
in
our
locality
but
it
is
a
solid
unique
smooth
beer
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
as
a
homebrewer
this
is
one
type
of
beer
i
hope
to
replicate
one
of
these
days
it
has
a
residual
sweetness
from
a
malty
brew
this
is
so
unique
because
it
is
a
smooth
lager
with
minimal
hops
to
leave
you
with
the
nice
flavor
of
dark
malt
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
exceptional
for
dark
beers
can
you
imagine
guinness
without
nitro
and
sourness
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
macksons
xxx
stout
but
you
can
taste
it
for
sure
i
wish
this
beer
was
a
little
more
common
i
cant
seem
to
get
it
in
alabama
i
was
only
able
to
purchase
it
in
austin
tx
when
i
lived
near
there
long
live
drinkability
downward
with
originality

beer

shading
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
nice
malty
roasted
smell
to
it
i
really
like
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
like
other
schwarzs
ive
had
also
has
an
excellent
tang
to
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
high
overall
very
nice
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
how
mild
the
flavor
is
in
this
beer
it
has
no
date
label
so
its
hard
to
tell
how
long
its
been
around
its
possible
a
little
oxidation
took
place
given
that
it
has
a
twisttop
cap
not
as
strong
of
a
seal
as
a
regular
cap
it
has
no
bad
flavors
to
it
so
i
cant
give
it
a
bad
score
try
it
for
yourself
opinion
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
like
the
malt
balance
and
the
complexity
of
the
grain
bill
i
think
that
it
is
a
bit
cloying
in
the
finish
and
it
keeps
a
dessert
like
syrupy
feeling
to
linger
on
the
back
of
the
throat
for
some
time
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
over
a
lot
of
other
beers
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
enjoyable
brew
light
and
fruity
definitely
the
best
schwarzbier
ive
had
to
date
if
i
lived
in
brazil
i
would
prolly
drink
this
if
it
were
all
i
could
find
an
interesting
brew
none
the
less
ill
start
with
the
disclaimer
i
really
like
this
beer
and
buy
it
every
month
or
so
true
to
its
style
this
beer
pours
jet
black
with
only
a
small
amout
of
light
getting
through
lighting
the
corners
of
the
pint
glass
a
deep
brown
it
has
a
finger
sized
mocha
colored
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
and
then
falls
unevenly
leaving
a
patchy
head
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
there
is
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
tinge
of
bitter
hop
aroma
initially
i
taste
a
bit
of
roasted
flavor
that
rolls
into
a
sweet
malty
full
bodied
sensation
that
fills
my
mouth
appearance
is
almost
jet
black
it
looks
like
a
porter
or
stout
without
the
thick
creamy
head
smell
is
slight
coffeeroast
aroma
no
diacetyl
or
esters
somewhat
malty
taste
has
an
underlying
sweetness
very
smooth
and
quaffable
extremely
smooth
and
very
high
drinkablility
overall
impression
black
lager
is
what
this
beer
is
focuses
on
the
sweeter
side
well
brewed
but
nothing
to
brag
about
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
great
either
not
something
i
will
feel
compelled
to
seek
out
again
though
i
wouldnt
shrink
from
it
either
still
it
was
nice
to
drink
at
the
end
of
a
long
2job
workday
while
listening
to
some
albert
king
very
different
just
wish
i
knew
what
some
of
these
more
alien
ingrediants
are
this
thing
starts
out
as
a
cowherders
delight
chock
with
heavy
malt
then
the
shell
game
of
flavors
and
nonflavors
starts
here
a
twang
of
some
undistinguishable
hoplike
remnant
there
a
swath
of
hard
country
water
everywhere
a
conveyance
of
uncertain
traits
that
never
quite
come
through
its
like
putting
beer
through
a
cheesecloth
and
tasting
what
was
once
a
beer
but
now
is
only
the
ghost
of
that
beer
hey
theres
even
some
caramel
and
light
coffee
in
the
dregs
live
amongst
the
dregs
and
prosper
i
tell
you
dpretty
good
i
had
two
before
dinner
when
poured
it
was
a
dark
brown
with
light
brown
foam
the
smell
was
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
it
just
seem
of
lack
luster
with
no
outstanding
aroma
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
hops
and
a
hint
of
spice
a
pleasant
surprise
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
i
didnt
drink
it
really
cold
but
drank
it
about
55
degrees
i
think
i
got
more
flavor
from
the
black
beer
being
just
a
touch
warmer
than
usual
overall
a
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
just
a
nice
smooth
easy
drinker
bottom
line
this
is
a
pretty
good
drinker
and
is
worth
trying
pours
black
with
brown
head
and
minor
lacing
lightly
hopped
with
caramel
and
dark
roasted
malt
dominating
the
aroma
similar
taste
with
a
sweet
dextrinous
rich
mouth
feel
caramel
malt
is
sweet
but
moderated
somewhat
by
the
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
not
a
typical
schwarzbier
but
nice
to
drink
served
on
the
chilly
side
50f
sweetness
is
less
noticable
much
better
than
i
expected
d
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
my
favorite
brazilian
beer
in
fact
its
the
only
brazilian
beer
ive
ever
had
this
beer
is
dark
it
had
a
tan
colored
head
the
smell
is
malty
there
is
a
coffee
like
taste
as
well
as
a
slight
caramel
finish
this
beer
is
fairly
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
good
for
the
style
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
d
a
very
simple
yet
satisfying
beer
not
a
complex
beer
but
certainly
drinkable
overall
its
not
bad
i
even
grabbed
a
second
one
a
while
later
because
it
was
there
but
the
flavors
fade
and
it
seems
to
be
missing
something
the
initial
flavors
and
sweetness
give
way
to
a
drying
bitterness
anyway
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
style
this
poured
to
a
magnificent
dark
brownblack
with
a
ruby
type
hue
in
my
duvel
glass
very
pretty
and
elgant
looking
beer
like
a
stout
with
a
finer
whitish
tan
head
the
smell
was
sweet
and
roasted
malt
coffeeish
the
first
taste
was
nice
maltiness
roastedness
like
a
caramel
latte
the
mouthfeel
was
exceedingly
light
and
thin
and
made
you
scratch
your
head
there
were
times
when
there
could
be
described
a
cloying
sweetness
i
would
pair
it
with
spicy
ribs
or
enchilada
mole
perhaps
desert
altogether
not
too
bad
worth
a
try
for
schwarzbier
fans
and
fans
of
brazil
alike
xingu
black
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
i
can
only
smell
the
faintest
amount
of
malt
and
thats
it
nice
taste
though
good
amount
of
malt
flavor
hops
dont
really
play
much
of
a
part
in
this
one
definitely
worth
a
try
didnt
get
much
aroma
poured
from
a
bottle
color
was
was
dark
brownblack
with
hint
of
red
at
bottom
slight
chocolate
and
malt
taste
and
okay
finish
although
it
tasted
a
little
watery
not
bad
but
just
an
average
beer
where
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
a
very
drinkable
if
not
overly
impressive
beer
practically
black
in
appearance
with
a
thin
lacy
head
this
beer
has
a
sortof
sweetness
to
it
that
i
find
annoying
after
a
couple
of
sips
it
is
light
enough
flavorwise
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
for
my
money
id
rather
go
a
different
route
whoever
it
was
that
said
it
was
like
a
thinner
version
of
a
stout
or
porter
was
right
on
worth
a
try
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
a
decent
schwarzbier
classic
flavors
and
rather
drinkable
its
nice
to
know
there
are
some
good
beers
coming
out
of
brazil
d
with
a
4
5
abv
medium
body
minimal
carbonation
and
downright
awesome
taste
i
am
absolutely
getting
another
one
of
these
i
cant
see
any
problem
sitting
around
with
a
six
pack
or
two
and
some
friends
and
going
through
a
bunch
of
these
extremely
smooth
and
very
high
drinkablility
you
have
to
hold
back
to
keep
yourself
from
chugging
the
whole
six
pack
definately
worth
a
try
this
was
the
first
dark
beer
i
tried
during
my
visit
to
southern
brazil
a
couple
years
ago
it
was
the
only
bottled
option
besides
antarctica
available
in
singles
at
the
loncheria
down
the
street
from
our
hotel
in
curitiba
then
i
discovered
bohemia
escura
at
the
supermarket
on
the
other
side
of
the
park
and
left
off
xingu
until
now
two
years
later
in
buffalo
ny
where
this
is
the
only
brazilian
beer
available
in
fact
i
think
that
this
might
be
the
only
brazilian
beer
imported
to
the
u
s
somebody
please
correct
me
if
im
wrong
if
memory
serves
which
it
might
not
the
nonexport
i
e
domestic
brazilian
bottle
looks
slightly
different
that
is
aside
from
not
having
any
english
text
on
it
but
i
cant
remember
exactly
how
more
elaborate
maybe
anyhow
after
twisting
it
open
xingu
pours
dark
brown
with
bright
garnet
highligts
and
a
creamy
meringued
khaki
head
the
nose
is
subtle
with
sourish
malts
and
a
leafyearthy
hop
presence
almost
like
an
english
porter
certainly
sweeter
than
any
other
schwarzbier
ive
ever
tasted
but
i
do
remember
this
being
maltier
when
i
tried
it
in
brazil
almost
like
an
alcoholic
malta
goya
there
are
vinous
notes
prune
juice
and
a
spicy
hop
ballast
to
temper
the
sweet
flavors
sticky
rings
of
lacing
appear
noticeable
metallic
aftertaste
medium
body
certainly
far
from
heavy
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chalky
and
dry
chewy
in
some
places
moderately
drinkable
i
really
dont
think
this
is
a
schwarzbier
but
perhaps
im
wrong
and
this
is
just
a
very
liberal
take
on
the
style
with
that
in
mind
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
singular
creation
interesting
novel
and
really
not
too
bad
overall
saude
this
is
a
beer
ive
wanted
to
try
for
a
while
finally
got
around
to
it
pours
jet
black
brown
fuzzy
head
not
too
thick
smells
malty
sweet
but
not
strong
tastes
a
bit
like
light
porter
if
there
is
such
a
thing
some
mild
roasty
chocolate
notes
and
a
sweet
lager
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
not
surprised
from
a
tropical
source
overall
its
not
bad
i
may
not
go
seek
it
but
would
have
it
again
make
it
a
bit
more
flavorful
and
this
would
be
a
real
winner
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
a
little
different
take
on
a
schwarzbier
however
aside
from
the
novelty
factor
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
drinkable
but
mediocre
hazlenutish
not
a
bad
taste
it
wasnt
the
best
beer
to
start
the
night
but
the
lack
of
hops
made
it
go
down
rather
smoothly
and
crisp
a
sweet
aftertaste
was
pretty
noticable
overall
its
pretty
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
this
brazilian
brew
anytime
soon
overall
some
people
might
be
turned
off
by
the
sweetness
but
i
really
liked
it
this
is
a
very
agreeable
beer
i
was
very
impressed
and
would
buy
it
again
quite
drinkable
with
low
abv
and
a
light
smoothness
the
roasted
character
gives
it
a
bit
more
complexity
than
many
lighter
brews
but
this
still
is
one
that
goes
down
easy
and
has
some
refreshing
qualities
to
it
pours
dark
brown
with
ruby
around
the
outside
thick
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
aroma
of
malt
and
coffee
mediumbodied
and
fairly
bitter
mild
coffee
and
hops
along
with
some
stale
malt
flavor
the
sweetness
dominates
after
the
initial
bitterness
wears
off
some
sour
notes
that
i
did
not
particularly
like
the
finish
is
creamy
and
sweet
with
chocolate
and
some
roasted
malt
okay
but
a
long
way
from
my
favorite
schwarzbiers
dim
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
have
another
a
good
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
and
returning
to
time
and
time
again
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
very
drinkable
not
complex
but
does
bring
a
good
amount
of
flavor
i
rate
it
above
average
on
the
style
pretty
drinkable
interesting
beer
from
the
amazon
i
dont
remember
this
stuff
being
so
drinkable
in
the
mid90s
last
time
i
had
it
black
but
not
opaque
cream
colored
head
very
yeasty
nose
a
bit
of
a
skunky
note
to
it
taste
is
very
strange
with
a
spicy
yeasty
flavor
mix
kind
of
a
milk
chocolate
like
flavor
mostly
this
is
dominated
by
yeast
though
and
i
cant
say
i
cared
for
it
i
wonder
if
this
beer
is
filtered
and
if
not
how
it
would
taste
if
it
were
not
a
great
beer
kind
of
glad
i
only
bought
one
drinkability
this
suffers
due
to
its
strange
flaver
it
is
interesting
but
im
not
a
big
wine
drinker
so
i
couldnt
drink
it
to
much
d
ill
never
drink
more
than
one
of
these
this
sixpack
cost
me
12
99
ill
pass
on
it
in
the
future
there
are
much
better
beers
for
much
less
money
uf
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
the
lower
abv
makes
it
a
great
choice
for
a
session
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
the
drinkability
is
decent
also
with
a
few
slight
adjustments
i
think
this
could
be
an
outstanding
beer
as
is
its
probably
a
great
crossover
beer
to
give
to
your
miller
lite
buddy
very
dark
nearly
black
with
a
red
tint
head
is
fairly
frothy
and
light
tan
lightly
roasted
black
malts
with
a
slight
chocolate
kicker
sweetness
takes
the
front
seat
with
the
hops
being
unnoticeable
pretty
much
no
aftertaste
as
soon
as
you
swallow
the
stuff
you
forget
what
it
tastes
like
but
it
is
pretty
smooth
somewhat
refreshing
a
decent
offering
out
of
brazil
i
didnt
find
anything
bad
about
this
beer
yet
i
dont
really
care
for
it
it
happens
boring
with
flavor
but
clumsy
too
often
sure
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
so
what
i
believe
this
beer
was
purchased
in
ia
it
was
given
to
me
a
few
weeks
back
thanks
bill
for
the
bottle
you
saved
my
buying
a
sixpack
of
this
costly
beer
ive
seen
in
ne
recently
if
you
see
a
bottle
on
the
cheap
try
it
sweet
maltiness
and
spicy
lightly
coffeelike
bitterness
quite
carbonated
light
fruitiness
lightly
sticky
and
long
light
bitter
aftertaste
interesting
beer
and
beter
than
expected
pours
a
dark
brownish
black
looks
great
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
the
aroma
is
strange
a
surpising
stale
odor
of
a
macro
euro
lager
not
very
pleasant
the
flavor
isnt
much
better
than
the
odor
this
brew
tastes
like
somebody
watered
down
one
ounce
of
a
decent
dark
lager
with
eleven
ouces
of
a
macro
lager
theres
something
very
artificial
about
this
beer
and
i
dont
like
it
i
will
be
steering
clear
of
this
one
in
the
future
a
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
due
to
its
sweetness
i
prefer
negra
modelo
which
i
feel
is
better
balanced
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
once
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
the
difference
is
that
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
i
could
have
forgotten
how
many
i
drank
if
i
didnt
run
out
of
them
so
fast
overall
it
is
now
rated
worth
a
try
i
would
change
that
to
give
it
a
chance
drinkability
over
all
an
average
beer
drinking
experience
per
bom
notes

abv
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
should
go
well
with
desserts
or
other
sweet
foods
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
reddish
hues
modest
tannish
head
with
qattractive
lacing
smell
is
dark
fruity
plums
prunes
raisain
figs
dates
combined
with
roasted
malt
in
an
excellent
manner
one
of
the
most
enticing
scents
ive
experienced
in
a
beer
taste
is
good
but
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
nice
sweet
toasty
maltiness
taste
does
seem
to
improve
as
the
beer
warms
and
more
of
the
fruitiness
begins
to
blossom
nice
and
creamy
leaves
a
very
nice
taste
and
feel
in
the
mouth
this
was
truly
a
tasty
beer
that
was
exceptionally
enjoyable
very
easy
to
drink
xingu
black
beer
isnt
good
it
tastes
too
much
like
a
saccharine
sweet
dark
beer
extract
added
dark
lager
pretender
part
of
the
problem
might
be
the
partial
lack
of
carbonation
i
opened
another
bottle
last
week
from
a
different
source
obtained
months
apart
that
was
totally
flat
and
undrinkable
even
properly
bubbled
though
i
doubt
that
id
be
impressed
d
this
beer
doesnt
really
live
up
to
the
hype
that
comes
with
the
cool
label
exotic
name
and
the
fact
that
youre
holding
a
black
beer
from
brazil
sounds
very
sexy
but
its
not
all
that
great
this
is
a
decent
watereddown
stout
type
of
beer
almost
like
a
weaker
milk
stout
in
some
ways
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
nothing
exceptional
or
particularly
memorable
i
dont
love
this
beer
but
for
not
being
from
a
beer
hotbed
in
south
america
i
have
to
admit
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
not
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
certainly
not
a
struggle
either
if
you
enjoy
stouts
and
porters
this
is
probably
right
up
your
alley
worth
a
shot
drinkability
way
to
sweet
to
be
consumed
in
any
volume
a
bottle
is
tough
enough
to
finish
light
in
the
mouth
feel
department
but
i
could
in
no
way
shape
or
form
drink
a
second
the
sugary
sweetness
makes
this
a
bit
difficult
for
me
to
drink
purchased
as
a
single
from
vulcan
beverage
new
to
al
worth
revisiting
its
a
decent
brew
its
definately
overpriced
for
what
it
is
i
paid
2
00
for
a
bottle
not
that
thats
a
lot
of
money
but
i
could
have
bought
a
dfh
90
for
less

the

cooler

a

some
light
roasted

and
slight

taste
is
pretty
bland
small
roasted

in
the
flavor
but
not
very
strong
slight
malty

and
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
beers
from
brazil
havent
impressed
me
yet

thats
a
decent

much
better
than
the

i
had
a
couple
of
years

which
was
marked

one
of
the
most

i
have
had

overall
impression
ok
im
impressed
very
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
slowed
me
down
a
bit
style
seems
all
over
the
place
a
bit
of
stout
a
bit
of
dunkle
a
bit
of
bock
a
bit
of
schwarzbier
eh
lets
call
it
a
euro
dark
lager
something
a
little
different
drinkable
and
goes
well
with
spicy

black

somewhat

not
all
that
pleasing
thin

doubt
i
would
try
this
one
again
i
first
had
this
beer
when
i
was
living
in
michigan
and
again
in
arizona
it
seems
to
be
at
least
partially
based
on
the
bock
style
though
few
liquor
stores
in
the
united
states
seem
to
carry
xingu
it
is
nonetheless
a
worthy
find
and
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
this
is
a
shwarzbier
in
my
opinion
and
as
far
as
shwarzbiers
go
this
ones
not
very
good
nothing
about
it
stood
out
other
than
the
fact
that
it
quenched
thirst
the
flavor
was
just
of
crappy
malts
an
no
hops
this
was
one
the
bartender
and
tulunes
recommended
and
im
dissapointed
sampled
at
the
southside
beer
expo
much
more
than
a
schwarzbier
not
hoppy
or
roasty
from
the
malts
but
rather
quiet
with
a
succinct
fruity
character
my
sample
had
lower
carbonation
than
other
beers
lighly
toffeeish
munich
malt
presence
with
a
light
some
munich
the
taste
was
of
subtle
dark
malts
with
hints
of
roastiness
it
was
also
a
little
grainy
definitely
had
some
adjucts
in
there
overall
i
like
it
but
its
a
bit
pricy
for
what
it
is
i
paid
8
99
for
a
six
and
its
not
really
the
kind
of
beer
that
youll
want
to
sit
back
and
drink
12
of
a
night
even
if
it
was
less
expensive
its
definitely
a
good
surprise
to
spring
on
your
beerdrinking
friends
might
keep
a
few
on
hand
right
aside
the
tusker
theyll
like
it
even
if
they
wont
buy
it
i
was
a
big
fan
and
would
definitely
go
back
to
this
one
drinkability
is
good
looks
like
a
porter
and
tastes
like
an
extra
malted
euro
lager
dark
ruby
not
much
light
gets
through
thin
tight
dusting
of
brown
head
lace
is
moderate
fresh
aroma
of
blackened
malts
caramel
roasted
barley
and
coffee
the
taste
is
really
pretty
nice
bitter
coffee
bean
and
chocolate
and
sweet
caramel
and
vanilla
yeah
definitely
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
light
bodied
and
slightly
watery
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
too
if
the
mouthfeel
were
better
this
would
really
be
a
top
notch
brew
as
it
is
id
drink
this
any
day
of
the
week
great
taste
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
thick
brown
cobweb

not
bad

decent
feel
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
ever
make
it
to
brazil
worth
a
trylove
it
or
hate
it
i
think
you
wont
regret
the
experience
ok
beer
i
might
buy
this
again
if
it
were
6
a
six
pack
but
at
8
a
sixer
i
dont
think
so
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
shortlived
tan
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
very
little
effervesence
once
the
head
is
gone
taste
is
largely
malty
with
hints
of
fig
apple
with
a
slight
toated
malt
finish
no
real
bitterness
to
speak
of
very
unusual
beer
yet
somehow
quite
drinkable
xingu
is
an
unusual
beer
plain
and
simple
complex
flavours
with
spice
overtones
make
this
an
unusual
taste
treat
indeed
my
wife
and
i
enjoyed
xingu
over
our
past
motorcycle
trip
when
we
stopped
for
the
evening
at
our
lodging
full
flavoured
with
a
hint
of
carmel
this
beer
is
an
interesting
choice
for
the
judges
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
very
dark
with
a
mocha
coloured
coarse
head
with
traces
of
burgundy
looks
completely
black
but
has
the
faintest
glint
of
dark
red
around
the
edges
smell
is
sweet
hint
of
wood
the
smell
is
sort
of
like
open
air
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
especially
for
such
a
dark
beer
tastes
of
sweet
chocolate
malt
and
a
hint
of
smokiness
a
nice
very
drinkable
beer
and
the
first
ive
had
from
brazil
upon
pour
i
had
a
tough
time
picking
up
the
aroma
is
it
somewhat
roasty
or
sweet
tough
to
tell
too
faint
otherwise
its
a
beautiful
looking
beer
big
fluffy
tan
head
that
leaves
tremendous
lace
and
a
nice
opaque
black
body
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
still
full
the
taste
can
best
be
described
as
interesting
i
would
say
its
mostly
caramelish
but
at
the
same
time
it
has
a
dull
cola
taste
as
an
overtone
this
is
definitely
more
malty
than
anything
it
finishes
very
sweetly
kind
of
like
a
candy
residue
its
not
the
greatest
brew
and
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
not
a
great
beer
at
all
fortunately
my
brother
exchanged
me
4
ounces
of
this
for
4
ounces
of
aventinus
so
he
could
put
the
label
in
his
collection
so
things
turned
out
well
in
the
end
not
something
id
really
have
again
its
the
deep
clingy
sweetness
of
rich
roasted
malt
along
with
nothing
else
the
flavor
is
onedimensional
it
cloys
almost
bitingly
and
ity
gives
no
reason
to
return
for
more
its
a
dessert
all
by
itself
and
not
an
especially
good
one
i
happen
to
love
brazilian
cuisine
but
if
this
is
any
indicator
i
wont
be
matching
it
to
any
brazilian
beers
i
cant
believe
they
drink
a
lot
of
this
during
carnival
but
if
they
do
im
staying
home
well
im
not
going
anyway
but
you
know
what
i
mean
weak
in
the
mouth
its
a
black
lager
i
suppose
but
it
feels
watered
down
easy
to
drink
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
just
lacks
that
extra
punch
or
any
distinguishing
characteristics
amply
hopped
with
a
very
unique
pectin
herb
and
citrusy
taste
a
honey
sweetness
reemerges
towards
the
end
it
feels
more
potent
than
its
listed
4
7
blackest
of
black
colorcoffee
like
aroma
with
a
hint
of
fudge
thin
but
nicely
sweet
malt
taste
a
strange
but
very
pleasant
aftertaste
there
definitely
seems
to
be
a
nutrasweet
type
enhancer
in
here
simple
one
dimensional
but
yet
tasty
and
refreshing
light
bodied
and
drainable
aside
from
the
aroma
this
is
halfdecent
unremarkable
but
halfdecent
very
dense
black
beer
with
a
slight
mahogony
tint
when
held
up
to
the
light
not
much
head
which
vanished
imeadiately
a
very
light
sweet
aroma
but
hard
to
pin
dowon
it
was
so
light
some
roasted
malt
bitterness
to
the
flavor
accompanyed
by
a
fruit
berry
sweetness
this
beer
was
almost
absoluteltey
flat
next
to
no
carbonation
which
is
why
i
think
i
had
such
a
hard
time
getting
any
distinct
aroma
or
flavor
without
carbonation
this
drinks
like
flat
root
beer
malt
leads
mostly
weak
and
watery
flavor
comes
off
the
palate
like
soda
pop
the
carbonation
is
like
pepsi
so
if
you
like
that
sort
of
feel
it
may
be
drinkable
to
you
i
didnt
think
it
was
any
good
new
beer
new
brewery
and
new
nation
of
origin
for
me
not
bad
for
12
ounches
of
matteblack
liquid
topped
by
a
thick
lasting
deeptan
head
that
head
by
the
way
never
faded
away
even
after
over
30
minutes
of
rest
in
my
glass
xingus
smell
is
one
blending
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
this
beer
starts
dry
and
sour
something
like
sand
texture
with
lemon
juice
flavor
it
is
a
fullbodied
beer
with
an
overall
sour
woody
taste
xingus
other
flavors
include
coffee
and
caramel
it
finishes
clean
and
semidry
with
a
very
longterm
but
subtle
aftertaste
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
lace
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
is
full
of
black
and
pale
malts
it
has
a
refreshing
scent
with
no
hops
the
taste
is
good
it
is
light
but
with
a
dark
feel
it
refreshes
on
the
finish
and
has
a
lingering
dark
malt
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
real
good
beer
it
drinks
very
well
an
excellent
sessions
beer
i
had
this
at
a
pizza
place
in
belo
horizonte
sweet
notes
dominate
this
beer
any
hop
bitterness
is
well
hidden
if
present
at
all
it
is
an
attractive
looking
beer
poured
pitch
black
with
a
tan
head
this
beer
is
not
as
popular
in
brazil
as
its
cousin
caracu
while
i
prefer
caracu
to
this
it
seems
as
this
will
be
brazils
main
export
beer
for
a
long
time
to
come
as
it
does
have
an
unusual
flavor
my
dad
got
me
hooked
on
xingu
its
dark
but
has
a
less
aggressive
flavor
than
the
stouts
i
personally
prefer
xingu
is
black
as
night
with
a
mocha
colored
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
start
with
maltiness
and
end
with
just
a
zip
of
hoppiness
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
wish
i
could
get
it
a
little
cheaper
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
it
was
quite
quaffable
and
had
an
enjoyable
taste
and
aroma
worth
trying
in
youre
tasting
south
american
beers
poured
jet
black
with
a
tan
head
looks
very
imposing
head
recedes
to
lace
along
the
sides
and
a
colony
of
foam
right
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
smell
is
of
chocolate
malt
and
herbal
noble
hops
the
beer
is
very
light
upon
the
palette
almost
as
if
it
skips
your
tongue
entirely
and
heads
down
the
back
of
your
throat
hint
of
roasted
chocolate
and
a
tinge
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
very
light
which
is
good
but
too
light
which
is
bad
very
drinkable
the
stuff
is
practically
air
in
a
glass
its
just
rather
boring
source
liquid
solutions
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
maybe
some
exotic
brazilian
tastes
in
the
end
i
was
just
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
black
color
good
head
medium
bodied
beer
roasted
malts
coffeelike
flavor
a
little
too
sweet
tasting
full
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
not
bad
finish
is
smooth
and
a
little
thin
aftertaste
is
dry
and
malty
the
beer
has
a
sweet
quilty
for
the
dry
finish
but
a
very
refreshing
beer
pours
a
dark
almost
if
not
completely
black
colour
with
a
nice
moderate
sized
tan
head
not
the
look
youd
expect
from
a
brew
from
brazil
but
good
nonetheless
the
smell
while
better
than
average
leavesa
bit
to
be
desired
seemed
a
bit
thin
merely
by
smell
alone
with
slight
amounts
of
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
apparent
but
not
anywhere
near
dominant
or
overpowering
the
body
and
flavour
need
work
here
very
thin
at
times
all
of
the
aformentioned
traits
are
evident
in
the
taste
as
well
as
the
smell
but
none
are
memorable
nor
does
anything
about
the
flavour
grasp
a
strong
hold
of
you
if
anything
is
memorable
its
a
sweetness
that
is
longer
lasting
than
it
should
be
which
is
not
a
good
thing
it
is
very
watery
much
moreso
than
would
be
expected
from
a
brew
that
looks
like
this
one
does
this
one
is
easy
drinking
a
bit
too
smooth
at
times
and
not
worth
the
price
that
i
usually
see
it
for
around
10
a
six
pack
at
most
places
whilse
schwarzbiers
are
many
times
few
and
far
between
there
are
far
better
options
at
this
price
range
if
youre
looking
for
a
sweeter
easy
drinking
brew
a
beer
brewed
in
brazil
sounds
kinda
odd
i
was
hesitant
to
try
this
one
but
i
sure
am
glad
that
i
did
it
was
black
in
color
with
a
solid
head
it
tasted
really
really
sweet
caramel
sweetness
is
what
id
equate
the
initial
taste
to
more
syrupy
sweetness
comes
in
and
dominates
the
beer
the
body
is
a
little
weak
and
that
lets
the
sweetness
go
too
far
but
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
well
i
finally
took
the
plunge
on
this
beer
after
almost
getting
it
many
timeswell
it
pours
a
pitch
black
with
almost
no
head
at
all
to
speak
of
a
roasted
aroma
with
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
thrown
inthe
taste
is
very
sweet
almost
to
sweet
with
a

and
a

beer
us
a
little

but
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
dark
and
it
didnt
fail
at
that
as
others
have
said
the
head
was
gone
before
it
could
raise
its
temperature
a
degree
it
had
a
nice
light
aroma
of
anise
the
flavor
that
stood
out
most
was
anise
followed
by
a
slight
sweetness
a
light
easy
drinking
beer
that
helps
pass
time
when
grilling
a
heavy
mouthfeel
it
drinks
quite
easily
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
not
necessarily
my
favorite
a
simple
set
of
flavors
but
well
crafted
notes
flavor
profile
turns
me
off
cloying
black
licorice
qualities
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
of
black
beers
but
have
certainly
had
tastier
interpretations
of
the
style
poured
a
third
of
this
down
the

pours
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
thin
and
bubbly

that
fades
into

is
sweet
malts
fresh
grains
and
a
touch
of
molasses
medium
in
body
much
lighter
than
the
appearance
leads
you
to
believe
and
smooth
in

taste
is
sweet
dark
malts
syrupy
molasses
and
chocolaty
caramel
up
front
and
lasting
through
the
middle
giving
way
to
some
coffeelike
bitterness
towards
the
end
an
interesting
and
unusual
beer
thats
worth
a
try
at
least
once
purchased
from
liquid
solutions
dark
brownish
almost
black
in
color
nice
wispy
brown
head
that
leaves
a
good
lacing
faint
roasted
coffee
malt
aroma
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
decent
roasted
malty
flavors
light
bodied
a
little
too
light
this
does
have
a
good
bitter
finish
not
all
that
bad
even
though
my
bottle
might
be
a
little
old
ng
this
beer
pours
nearly
opaque
brownblack
with
a
moderately
large
tan
dissipating
head
the
beer
is
so
dark
in
fact
that
the
clarity
really
could
not
be
discerned
the
smell
is
malty
and
coffee
with
a
slight
sourness
the
taste
is
of
coffee
like
charcoal
with
an
odd
mustiness
slight
alcohol
peeking
through
and
a
mild
hoppy
finish
it
has
a
peculiar
mouthfeel
that
seems
heavier
than
it
really
is
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
odd
flavors
of
mustiness
and
charcoal
definitely
detracts
from
it
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
drink
several
of
these
i
was
reluctant
to
try
this
beer
why
i
really
have
no
reason
its
nothing
special
but
its
not
too
bad
either
you
can
obviously
see
that
the
brazilians
spend
more
time
on
soccer
than
they
do
beer
but
i
guess
thats
the
way
it
goes
the
color
was
a
very
nice
rich
deep
dark
red
almost
black
the
head
was
very
thin
and
hung
around
for
a
while
the
smell
was
pretty
similar
to
any
mainstream
us
beer
the
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
as
well
but
with
more
roasted
body
to
it
i
guess
the
only
difference
is
the
black
color
i
would
get
it
again
though
its
fairly
cheap
and
would
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
12oz
bottle
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
colored
head
it
has
a
sweet
malty
nose
with
some
faint
hints
of
chocolate
and
roastiness
a
fairly
sweet
malty
taste
typical
lager
smoothness
to
it
i
get
some
roastiness
in
the
aftertaste
too
a
little
sweet
for
this
style
but
overall
a
decent
brew
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
im
not
getting
the
taste
schwarzbier
but
who
knows
what
the
brazilian
market
for
german
styles
is
uh
oh
and
i
visited
it
often
in
the
dawn
of
my
beer
exploration
i
thought
it
exotic
then
light
chocolate
brown
this
rare
find
is
one
that
is
so
unique
that
i
can
only
compare
to
that
of
a
brazilian
beauty
the
dark
chocolate
roasts
are
present
along
with
a
nut
flavor
that
makes
this
beer
so
smooth
and
refreshing
the
best
way
to
characterize
this
beer
is
that
it
has
the
body
of
a
porter
with
the
taste
of
a
nice
oatmeal
stout
as
my
warm
hand
slowly
grasped
the
sweaty
bottle
of
xingu
i
inquisitively
peered
at
the
mysterious
brazilian
brew
pouring
its
contents
into
my
pint
glass
i
cautiously
approached
the
mouth
of
my
pint
glass
as
if
i
was
standing
at
the
mouth
of
the
amazon
river
i
was
now
ready
to
let
my
tongue
dance
the
samba
with
this
dark
beer
that
provided
a
copious
amount
of
intrigue
to
its
tasters
like
a
fine
brazilian
beauty
xingus
dark
body
was
sensual
and
satisfying
to
the
eyes
and
the
tastes
buds
a
smooth
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
finishes
the
flavor
of
this
beer
to
create
pure
enjoyment
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
extremely
black
with
a
tan
almost
brown
head
that
leaves
a
thin
trail
of
lace
theres
a
grainy
almost
smoky
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
somewhat
sweet
and
a
big
soft
mouthfeel
finish
does
dry
out
and
becomes
grainy
with
maybe
a
little
tannin
its
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
the
label
says
black
beer
so
i
have
to
go
with
the
schwarzbier
tag
nice
pour
black
with
a
tan
head
that
starts
off
well
but
fades
to
a
thin
collar
interesting
first
taste
sweet
almost
grape
like
no
hops
to
talk
about
i
could
not
distinguish
the
malts
a
slight
creamy
smoke
taste
but
no
big
finish
as
the
beer
looks
like
it
should
have
it
was
talked
up
so
much
at
my
local
pub
i
had
to
try
not
impressed
wow
i
got
far
more
than
i
bargained
for
with
this
one
first
off
theres
not
a
shot
in
hell
that
this
is
a
germanstyle
schwarzbier
but
on
the
other
hand
i
dont
know
what
category
it
should
be
put
in
either
its
hazy
bottle
conditioned
and
brownblack
in
color
it
pours
a
good
size
orangishtan
head
that
holds
very
well
and
leaves
some
lace
it
offers
a
bold
aroma
of
dark
dried
fruit
with
prune
plum
cherry
with
pits
and
some
nuttiness
as
well
its
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
sweetly
malty
with
some
chocolate
dark
sugar
a
light
acidic
sharpness
and
a
somewhat
woody
character
it
finishes
semidry
with
lingering
fruit
malt
notes
as
well
as
a
gentle
touch
of
soft
licorice
very
odd
but
enjoyable
intriguing
a
style
apart
very

light
coming
through
at

that

roasted

with
some

and

a
little
too
watery
which
takes
away
some
of
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
dry
finish
and
little
hop
presence
a
very
different
beer
tastes
good
as
it
warms
too

dissipated
quickly
the

that
i
did
not
care
for
the
taste
was
more

good
the
mouthfeel
was
thin

the

was
gone
before
i

i
was
let
down
on
this
one
as
schwarzbier
is
my
favorite
style
i
will
revisit
again
sometime
and
give
it
another
chance
but
for
now
it
is
poor
this
ebony
beauty

on

but
finishes
quick
clean
dry
and
very
light

theres
an
acicity

intermix
the

softly
lingers

subdued

unfortunately
this
brew
lacks
a

the

wont
be
the
last

i
enjoy
a
xingu
love
this
beer
had
for
the
first
time
at
the
peculiar
pub
in
new
york
city
made
a
huge
impression
strong
but
you
can
drink
it
brewed
in
brazil
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
a
black
beer
the
body
was
intentionally
light
but
still
had
a
lot
of
roasted
caramelmolasses
flavor
and
yet
was
not
too
sweet
sort
of
a
lite
stout
worth
a
try
for
both
porter
and
stout
fans
o
interesting
mix
of
darker
malt
with
floral
hops
a
darker
beer
in
which
you
can
really
detect
the
hops
good
brew
tons
of
flavor
and
very
drinkable
this

is

a

at

a
dark

by

drinks

with

o
not
a

beer
this
beer
is
advertized
as
a
germanstyle
schwarz
but
i
think
its
pretty
close
to
a
lot
of
porter
and
stouts
ive
tried
with
the
dark
coffees
and
dark
chocolate
aspects
a
pretty
tasty
drink
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
light
and
roasty
pretty
simple
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
and
nice
and
crisp
finishing
a
depth
of
character
here
between
the
hops
and
roast
of
grain
overall
a
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
o
i
havent
had
too
many
schwarzbier
to
compare
this
to
but
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
had
a
nice
appearance
and
aroma
and
a
pretty
nice
taste
not
the
best
aftertaste
in
the
world
but
not
bad
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
nothing
that
stands
out
about
it
though
glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
sam
schwarzbieri
like
yelling
that
and
sounding
all
incharge
and
what
not
and
speaking
of
incharge
thats
called
a
segue
this
beer
is
all
incharge
up
in
here
though
not
much
to
look
at
with
its
notsoblack
appearance
and
lack
of
bubbly
head
it
smells
heavenly
sweet
and
inviting
pretty
sure
i
smelled
some
hops
but
who
knows
a
little
too
bitter
to
be
refreshing
but
i
do
sense
that
said
bitterness
is
a
function
of
hops
and
thats
ok
black
with
a
thin
skim
earthy
roast
aroma
and
flavor
thin
ring
ofthe
edges
reddish
copper
color
in
the
light
dry
and
roasty
aroma
dry
bitter
flavor
some
woody
smokiness
with
traces
lingering
nicely
in
the
aftertaste
dry
and
savory
would
pick
this
up
if
i
saw
it
its
a
nice
schwarzbier
o
overall
this
had
potential
to
be
a
decent
beer
however
that
off
metallic
taste
and
aroma
really
ruins
this
beer
for
me
o
i
like
this
beer
its
not
amazing
but
its
solid
the
look
and
smell
of
this
beer
are
its
high
points
i
though
it
was
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
the
first
thing
that
hits
me
is
the
astringent
bitterness
terrible
terrible
hops
and
way
too
much
for
a
dark
beer
i
know
that
hops
are
supposed
to
supply
the
bitterness
in
a
schwarz
but
the
idea
is
that
they
arent
as
bitter
as
strongerflavoured
dark
beers
right
this
bitterness
hides
all
the
lovely
flavours
that
could
be
lurking
underneath
this
is
not
refreshing
at
all
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
singlefinger
tan
head
that
goes
away
fairly
quickly
without
leaving
much
of
any
lacing
behind
the
nose
has
faint
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
is
quite
similar
with
roasted
malt
dominating
though
not
being
over
the
top
with
some
chocolate
in
the
background
lightmedium
body
with
slight
chewiness
and
a
semidry
finish
a
pretty
decent
example
of
the
style
though
i
could
use
a
bit
more
depth
o
best
on
tap
but
the
cans
are
great
too
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
flavor
is
a
bit
thin
and
too
sharp
in
its
acridity
still
the
nutty
malt
backbone
isnt
without
merit
as
it
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
a
bit
of
bread
crust
and
a
raw
leafy
hop
bitterness
to
round
out
the
profile
mouthfeel
is
light
with
big
carbonation
bubbles
that
add
to
the
sharpness
overall
not
my
favorite
abw
beer
but
ill
still
happily
imbibe
the
remaining
5
black
thunders
in
my
fridge
initial
taste
matches
the
aroma
then
becomes
oddly
neutral
before
a
grainy
roasted
wallop
to
the
back
of
the
throat
that
well
tastes
kinda
like
a
roach
not
the
crawling
kind
i
can
see
how
burnt
flavor
could
be
overpowering
to
some
but
to
me
it
was
delicious
of
the
few
schwarzbiers
ive
tried
this
is
indisputably
the
best
i
hope
they
can
this
stat
i
really
love
austin
beerworks
and
was
very
excited
to
try
this
though
black
thunder
is
just
a
bit
to
burnt
and
charred
for
my
tastes
worth
a
try
but
not
one
of
abws
better
offering
imo
hopefully
this
beer
is
canned
because
i
could
drink

poured
into

and

over
1530
minutes
jacks
abby
doesnt
disappoint
here
the
palate
opens
with
juicy
bitter
grapefruit
juice
and
pine
before
segueing
into
a
blend
of
caramel
toffee
and
cocoa
before
finishing
with
a
wonderful
juicy
hop
bitterness
nutty
earthy
with
hints
of
burnt
sugar
the
blend
of
flavors
is
particularly
harmonious
here
bringing
to
mind
one
of
the
better
abas
ive
had
hill
farmsteads
jimmy
mediumfull
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
soft
and
creamy
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
just
fabulous
especially
the
balance
between
the
flavors
of
citrus
hops
pine
bitterness
and
the
roasted
malt
flavors
awesome
stuff
overall
a
tasty
black
beer
lovely
balance
of
hops
and
roasted
maltscoffee
really
high
drinkability
black
with
a
plentiful
fine
foam
head
lots
of
glass
sticking
lace
both
the
aroma
and
taste
are
a
strong
and
well
balanced
combination
of
roasted
malt
and
piney
chops
neither
overpowers
the
other
medium
bodied
and
light
carbonation
one
of
the
best
bottled
beers
i
can
recall
this
one
has
a
subtle
devil
may
care
attitude
but
respects
the
style
completely
wonderful
o
eeeked
in
to
the
outstanding
especially
given
the
lager
category
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
at
the
edges
and
a
creamy
fluffy
tan
head
that
persists
forever
aromas
of
floral
spicy
resinous
hops
with
bits
of
bitter
chocolate
flakes
and
a
hint
of
coffee
the
flavor
is
rich
chocolate
and
hints
of
coffee
with
a
solid
shot
of
earthy
resinous
hop
flavor
moderate
hop
bitterness
lasting
long
into
the
finish
of
each
sip
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
very
nice
black
ipa
but
it
really
does
straddle
the
line
of
being
a
porter
o
the
only
prior
experience
that
i
have
had
with
such
a
beer
has
been
wookie
jack
which
i
did
not
like
perhaps
i
got
an
old
one
needless
to
say
i
was
thrilled
with
the
quality
of
this
one
it
was
excellent
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
recommend
it
to
those
who
enjoy
ipas
porters
or
anything
in
between
overall
ive
always
been
a
schwarzbier
fan
and
this
one
it
top
of
its
class
mouthfeel
of
a
stout
with
the
hop
bitterness
of
an
ipa
pours
very
dark
mahogany
into
the
weyerbacherlabelled
tumbler
twoandahalf
fingers
of
tan
roughtopped
head
leaves
attractive
lacing
really
nice
pronounced
olfactory
presence
toffee
chocolate
milk
roasted
grain
alcohol
taste
is
that
of
a
quality
schwarzbier
with
a
certain
hoppy
tang
that
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
to
a
proper
serving
temperature
its
not
outstanding
but
certainly
respectable
and
serviceable
mouthfeel
is
a
little
aggressive
but
adequately
thick
o
the
taste
is
what
makes
this
beer
worth
seeking
out
it
has
a
distinctly
oldschool
pacific
northwest
hop
character
that
blends
perfectly
with
the
slightly
bitter
character
of
the
roasted
malt
and
the
lack
of
esters
remind
you
this
is
100
lager
a
really
well
crafted
beer
and
absolutely
delicious
another
incredible
brew
from
jacks
abby
the
beer
pours
a
deep
chocolaty
brown
with
a
massive
head
of
creamy
sand
colored
bubbles
the
head
sits
two
fingers
widths
above
the
glass
with
a
nice
lasting
retention
and
a
puzzle
grid
of
thin
lacing
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
delicately
of
roasted
coffee
beans
and
damp
pine
forests
smooth
dark
chocolate
works
its
way
into
the
nose
alongside
musty
earth
and
subtle
dankness
the
balance
on
the
nose
between
hops
and
malt
is
quite
nice
and
intriguing
as
i
sniff
for
longer
i
start
to
sense
oranges
dipped
in
chocolate
which
is
quite
inviting
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
bitter
with
roast
and
hoppy
bitters
the
finish
brings
a
splash
of
sweet
chocolate
and
bready
malts
and
a
pop
of
citric
acidity
also
lingers
in
the
finish
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sweet
citrus
lemon
quickly
falling
into
bitter
pine
resin
and
decadently
toasted
bread
blending
roasted
coffee
and
espresso
bean
flavors
through
rich
dark
chocolates
subtle
grass
and
herbal
hops
work
their
way
into
the
finish
alongside
a
beautiful
burp
of
milk
chocolate
and
toasted
oatmeal
bread
the
aftertaste
is
of
moderately
bitter
pine
resin
which
sticks
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
with
a
middling
carbonation
and
a
crisp
snappy
mouthfeel
that
provides
nice
drinkability
and
scrubs
away
some
of
the
heavier
roast
and
bitter
flavors
after
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
with
slight
spittle
in
the
cheeks
soft
bitter
burn
down
the
middle
of
the
tongue
and
a
sticky
resinous
feel
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
beautifully
balanced
hoppy
lager
terrific
pine
and
roasted
malts
tango
on
the
tongue
in
a
way
that
i
very
much
appreciate
the
closest
thing
to
compare
this
to
would
be
an
american
black
ale
but
this
beer
is
miles
ahead
of
that
style
in
terms
of
balance
this
could
please
a
hop
head
and
a
roasted
malt
lover
at
the
same
time
another
superb
beer
from
jacks
abby
another
winner
from
jacks
abby
its
getting
to
be
where
i
can
buy
anything
from
them
and
expect
it
to
be
great
pretty
good
beer
in
a
relatively
unexplored
style
for
me
from
the
taste
alone
it
reminds
me
of
the
lager
version
of
a
black
ipa
when
you
take
a
porter
malt
bill
and
mate
it
with
an
ipa
hop
bill
only
in
this
case
using
bottomfermenting
yeast
and
a
cold
fermentation
i
wish
i
had
more
of
the
style
to
compare
to
but
its
pretty
good
nonetheless
if
roasty
and
piney
are
your
thing
o
roasted
and
chocolate
but
no
hop
flavor
just
the
bittering
verdict
did
age
hurt
this
was
it
this
muddled
from
the
getgo
i
like
schwarzbiers
and
the
prospect
of
a
hoppy
one
was
exciting
but
this
just
seems
like
one
that
got
overhopped
yet
not
hoppy
enough
id
like
to
revisit
this
beer
when
its
fresher
overall
a
decent
enough
brew
for
me
the
hops
clashed
just
a
tiny
but
with
the
roasted
characteristics
glad
i
had
it
seems
fairly
representative
of
the
style
but
probably
not
a
regular
for
me
overall
another
nice
americanized
interpretation
of
a
lager
by
the
folks
at
jacks
abby
overall
underwhelming
its
good
for
a
lager
but
that
can
be
said
of
most
of
jacks
abby
beers
overall
this
is
great
not
sure
if
it
would
have
been
better
back
in
march
vs
may
but
another
solid
lager
from
jacks
abby
overall
definitely
a
solid
beer
tasted
blind
i
would
have
guesses
this
was
an
american
porter
would
have
liked
to
see
the
hop
presence
kicked
up
a
touch
more
but
a
very
solid
overall
brew
cheers
the
cs
poured
frothily
from
the
5
liter
bottle
piling
the
tan
head
way
over
the
top
of
my
pilsner
glass
color
is
a
deep
rich
brown
and
the
aroma
is
primarily
dark
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
this
is
an
extrememly
tasty
beer
just
fine
for
a
cool
spring
day
although
the
significant
hopping
does
not
intrude
on
the
overall
balance
this
beer
could
use
a
little
more
middle
this
is
obviously
amped
up
from
the
traditional
style
but
still
in
the
family
i
wonder
what
the
draft
version
is
like
this
one
was
kindly
laid
on
me
by
jamie
magee
during
a
visit
to
iron
hill
lancaster
o
a
pleasantly
hoppy
schwarzbier
this
was
damn
tasty
and
ja
continues
to
amaze
me
with
their
innovative
lagers
pours
wall
to
wall
black
no
color
to
be
found
beige
head
puffs
up
big
with
the
initial
pour
good
lacing
and
retention
nailed
the
look
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
chocolate
molasses
and
doughy
malt
some
pine
and
citrus
hoppiness
in
there
as
well
theres
more
sweet
roasted
malt
character
than
i
expect
from
the
style
its
a
pleasant
aroma
but
its
more
of
a
schwarzbier
on
steroids
than
a
hoppy
schwarzbier
at
least
in
my
opinion
im
getting
a
fair
bit
of
roast
fruitiness
pretty
rich
clean
lager
flavor
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
and
still
quite
rich
lots
of
fudge
and
treacle
big
coffee
and
pine
needle
finish
again
over
the
top
for
the
style
but
still
a
very
well
made
beer
and
quite
tasty
im
still
not
convinced
that
big
hops
and
big
roasted
malt
works
well
together
but
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
attempt
and
im
sure
fans
of
american
black
ales
and
whatnot
will
like
this
beer
very
creamy
mouthfeel
a
bit
much
for
the
style
but
who
cares
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
have
called
it
an
ale
in
a
blind
tasting
knowing
its
a
lager
i
can
bit
out
some
of
that
clean
yeastiness
but
the
hops
and
malt
are
too
big
for
me
to
have
guessed
right
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
what
jacks
abby
does
they
really
did
a
nice
job
with
this
style
beer
o
really
yummy
beer
could
be
considered
a
black
ipa
nice
mix
of
black
patent
and
citrus
hops
a
great
beer
by
jack
abby
not
surprisingly
o
my
first
review
for
this
beer
was
with
a
lessthanfresh
bottle
but
this
time
around
it
shines
a
great
beer
for
the
transition
from
spring
to
winter
another
knockout
from
jacks
abby
if
the
bottle
didnt
tell
me
it
was
a
lager
i
wouldnt
believe
it
a
great
balance
of
roast
burnt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
really
elevated
everything
pretty
much
a
black
ipa
in
lager
form
good
stuff
it
was
hard
to
tell
if
i
liked
the
flavor
i
want
to
like
it
as
i
absolutely
love
schwarzbiers
but
the
dank
green
tealike
hops
dont
mesh
well
with
the
malt
flavor
its
strange
because
i
typically
love
black
ipas
so
im
not
aversed
to
dark
malts
and
hops
getting
along
ultimately
i
think
the
strong
cascade
hop
presence
here
ruins
the
schwarzbier
rather
than
compliments
it
as
i
drank
it
i
wished
i
was
just
drinking
a
traditional
black
lager
odanother
jacks
gem
i
wish
all
schwarzbiers
were
like
this
would
be
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
i
have
had
if
it
was
one
a
solid
way
to
enter
into
the
1000
review
club
o
black
ipas
are
all
the
rage
these
days
and
jacks
abby
decided
to
get
in
on
the
action
dont
think
for
a
second
that
this
is
simply
a
reflex
jump
on
the
bandwagon
type
of
reaction
though
never
content
to
just
follow
the
trends
jacks
abby
has
put
their
own
unique
spin
on
the
style
essentially
creating
a
black
ipl
lagers
are
after
all
the
only
thing
they
brew
this
is
a
well
made
beer
from
start
to
finish
clean
and
drinkable
nice
roasted
but
not
burnt
malt
base
impressively
bold
and
spicy
hop
profile
yet
another
great
entry
into
the
increasingly
diverse
jacks
abby
portfolio
of
brews
man
i
love
this
beer
i
really
have
no
idea
what
a
schwarzbier
is
supposed
to
taste
like
all
i
know
is
this
beer
is
delicious
cant
wait
to
try
the
kiwi
rising
i
have
stashed
in
the
fridge
downstairs
in
the
cellar
a
blackbrown
color
thick
and
covered
with
a
reasonable
layer
of
light
oatmeal
colored
head
with
fair
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
smokey
charcoal
with
a
tart
pear
idea
very
pleasant
the
flavor
brings
a
tart
malt
and
more
smoky
charcoal
theres
a
subtle
herbal
hop
but
its
really
pretty
simple
and
plenty
good
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
fairly
aqueous
but
slightly
chalky
feel
carbonation
is
very
refined
but
more
than
adequate
for
this
style
i
liked
it
and
recommend
it
very
impressive
stuff
this
bottling
is
fairly
old
from
what
i
hear
but
it
has
held
up
well
hops
have
been
reduced
to
more
of
a
background
note
but
the
excellent
dark
malt
foundation
is
enough
to
carry
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
but
not
quite
black
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
smell
is
a
really
nice
mix
of
hops
and
roasted
maltchocolate
not
unlike
a
black
ipa
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
thought
it
doesnt
quite
come
together
as
well
i
had
hoped
after
an
awesome
aroma
both
the
hoppiness
and
roastiness
of
this
beer
are
quite
nice
but
theres
a
bit
more
of
a
clash
in
flavors
than
i
had
hoped
for
the
two
types
of
bitterness
dont
quite
coincide
as
well
as
ive
experienced
in
the
best
of
black
ipas
and
thus
it
comes
off
as
a
little
overly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
high
it
doesnt
detract
much
from
the
experience
but
it
could
use
a
little
more
body
overall
this
may
be
the
first
jacks
abby
beer
that
i
wasnt
absolutely
in
love
with
i
love
schwarzbiers
but
black
ipas
are
hit
and
miss
for
me
and
this
beer
comes
closer
to
a
black
ipa
than
a
schwarz
theres
certainly
a
uniqueness
to
it
as
it
has
some
lager
characteristics
but
it
could
be
a
little
more
balanced
an
enjoyable
hoppy
black
lager
that
doesnt
attack
you
with
hops
but
uses
them
strongly
and
tastefully
i
like
the
pine
and
spicy
hop
profile
im
seriously
impressed
with
this
creation
i
was
worried
about
the
hops
dominating
and
destroying
the
flavor
components
that
make
a
schwarzbier
and
schwarzbier
but
the
brewmaster
certainly
knows
how
to
employ
just
enough
to
get
the
best
out
of
the
hops
without
compromising
the
styles
key
notes
overall
man
i
think
jacks
abby
is
just
killing
it
ive
had
three
of
their
beers
and
loved
them
all
this
no
exception
dark
roasty
and
hoppy
very
nice
all
around
d
very
drinkable
really
great
smoothness
and
texture
with
a
great
balance
of
flavors
a
really
nice
dark
lager
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
lager
really
delicious
with
wonderful
aromas
another
great
lager
by
jacks
abby
usually
not
a
style
i
go
crazy
over
but
i
found
this
one
quite
pleasant
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
still
maintained
good
roasty
qualities
taste
is
chocolatey
dark
sweetness
to
start
malts
continue
through
rich
body
of
the
center
and
hoppiness
comes
on
strong
to
the
close
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
drinkability
is
great
as
well
nice
one
here
notes
the
up
front
hopiness
is
a
little
bit
different
but
the
smokiness
makes
up
the
rest
of
this
vert
tasty
beer
cheers

o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
nice
drinkable
feel
this
seems
to
just
slide
by
with
little
effort
i
almost
dont
notice
how
much
i
have
had
nice
concept
and
wellexecuted
i
think
this
could
use
a
touch
more
in
the
nose
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
d
i
dont
think
i
could
tell
this
is
a
lager
in
a
blind
tasting
however
i
would
still
think
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
cascadian
dark
ale
kudos
to
jacks
abby
for
bringing
bold
flavors
to
the
lager
side
of
things
chris
and
i
easily
finished
the
500ml
bottle
and
id
have
happily
done
so
on
my
own
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
is
not
trying
to
be
something
it
is
not
very
well
crafted
beer
4
55
overall
super
drinkable
nice
and
dry
i
think
this
drinks
a
bit
more
like
a
black
ipa
than
a
schwarzbier
one
of
the
better
newer
beers
from
massachusetts
also
the
price
cannot
be
beat
i
will
get
this
again
a
very
tasty
and
fairly
well
balanced
beer
however
i
found
the
body
to

a

thin
overall
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
roasty
flavor
and
bitterness
the
dominate
characteristic
in
aroma
and
flavor
color
a
bit
dark
for
the
style
but
otherwise
appearance
spot
on
head
was
excellent
beer
finished
dry
and
besides
very
minor
astringency
mouthfeel
was
spot
on
for
the
style
use
of
american
hops
with
citrus
aromas
and
flavors
differentiates
this
from
other
swcharzbiers
but
not
in
a
bad
way
american
hops
worked
well
with
the
roastiness
clean
lager
fermentation
a
smooth
roasty
lager
thank
you
jack
for
providing
nontraditional
craft
lagers
to
ma
im
looking
forward
to
more
from
jacks
abby
congratulations
overall
a
really
nice
and
tasty
offering
from
jacks
abby
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurt
this
a
bit
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
it
and
found
it
easy
to
drink
im
sure
better
qc
will
fix
that
in
the
future
and
make
this
even
better
tastethe
taste
was
ok
just
a
bit
hoppy
but
i
couldnt
really
taste
much
do
to
everytime
i
drank
from
my
snifter
i
got
the
smell
of
marijuana
in
my
nose
and
mouth
i
would
just
recommend
for
the
brewery
they
just
tone
down
the
hops
a
little
bit
o
a
great
beer
i
really
love
these
beers
everything
ive
had
from
these
guys
have
been
impressive
and
this
is
no
exception
o
jacks
abby
does
it
again
easily
the
1
schwarzbier
ive
ever
had
tastes
not
far
from
a
black
ipa
or
american
black
ale
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
similar
to
the
hoppy
feet
i
had
not
too
long
ago
a
little
less
hoppy
makes
the
hops
not
stand
out
so
far
but
the
balance
and
drinkability
is
better
its
crisp
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
hard
to
beat
chocolate
tastes
a
little
funky
with
punchy
citrus
hops
no
noticeable
technical
flaws
in
the
beer
though
very
well
crafted
my
palate
desires
something
else
a
very
good
beer
and
another
winner
from
jacks
abbey
man
i
love
having
these
guys
in
our
backyard
o
really
impressed
with
this
black
lager
i
definitely
want
to
try
more
of
their
products
overall
very
nice
the
malts
take
the
lead
with
nice
caramel
and
chocolate
and
a
not
of
the
lager
comes
through
but
it
ads
a
nice
crispness
and
soft
feel
hops
are
done
well
it
would
be
very
easy
to
over
do
them
and
all
the
flavors
blend
well
to
a
really
nice
drinkable
well
done
beer
what
can
you
say
another
great
beer
from
ja
again
tastes
more
like
a
stout
or
porter
to
me
than
a
schwarzbier
but
still
a
great
session
lager
a
bit
thin
feeling
for
all
the
flavor
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
is
well
worth
trying
i
really
like
the
experimenting
this
new
brewery
is
doing
blending
american
influence
with
traditional
lager
styles
well
worth
checking
out
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
things
develop
at
jacks
abby
prost
hmmm
i
love
it
to
be
honest
jacks
abby
has
found
a
niche
do
what
american
craft
brewers
have
been
revolutionizing
over
the
last
decade
but
apply
it
to
traditional
german
styles
its
unique
but
it
falls
somewhere
between
a
nut
brown
ale
euro
dark
lager
black
ipa
and
baltic
porter
it
works
very
well
for
me
i
could
drink
this
by
the
growlerfull
overall
my
first
taste
of
this
brewer
and
i
liked
the
twist
on
the
style
the
hopdriven
brew
with
a
good
sized
kick
of
abnormal
alcohol
made
this
one
unique
and
enjoyable
clearly
not
an
ale
but
has
a
lot
of
characteristics
of
a
black
ipa
i
actually
like
this
better
very
worth
a
try
was
excited
to
have
a
beer
brewed
by
the
first
female
fff
brewer
and
also
carries
martellus
bennets
nickname
on
draft
at
fff
brewpub
and
served
in
a
dimpled
mug
appearance
is
clear
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
that
show
through
when
held
up
to
finding
nemo
which
is
playing
behind
my
sister
a
twofinger
tan
head
collapses
pretty
quickly
to
a
cap
and
leaves
a
minimal
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
roasty
malt
brown
bread
sugar
that
hints
at
caramel
taste
is
malt
sweetness
with
toasty
and
nutty
notes
some
wisps
of
cocoa
and
bread
crust
a
light
roasty
and
leafy
bitterness
comes
on
the
swallow
medium
body
thin
texture
average
carbonation
ashy
bitter
but
abrupt
finish
swung
by
the
brew
house
for
some
beer
and
good
times
success
in
both
accounts
be
arrived
in
a
stein
poured
black
as
night
with
reasonable
head
streaky
lacing
at
best
nose
is
spot
on
heavily
rotated
smoked
malt
the
peat
is
there
but
dialed
back
quite
a
bit
the
flavor
is
also
spot
on
one
if
the
best
smoked
beers
i
have
ever
had
light
and
easy
drinking
and
not
polarizing
at
all
just
wonderful
i
had
this
german
raven
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
served
in
a
stein
with
a
2
finger
fluffy
whiteoff
white
foam
color
is
licorice
black
smells
of
a
munich
malt
and
a
bit
of
roast
chocolate
taste
is
very
crisp
not
overly
sweet
a
very
nice
malty
body
with
a
crisp
lager
finish
a
very
solid
offering
dont
get
hung
up
on
ipa
or
big
stouts
from
this
group
they
make
outstanding
beers
in
lesser
sought
after
styles
the
einhorn
or
black
unicorn
is
a
very
nice
marzen
style
beer
the
beer
poured
a
nearly
opaque
black
with
what
light
coming
through
being
a
reddish
hue
there
is
a
white
head
that
is
leaving
sa
lace
the
scent
and
taste
carry
a
fire
place
like
smokeroast
almost
can
be
described
like
burnt
pop
corn
there
is
also
dark
chocolate
and
maybe
a
hint
of
marrichano
sp
cherry
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
marzen
o
3fs
second
best
lager
to
munsterfest
wish
they
bottled
this
one
and
the
chick
that
brews
this
is
smoking
hot
das
kleine
schwarz
einhorn
aka
black
unicorn
is
a
delicious
schwarz
i
had
it
on
tap
at
acre
in
andersonville
one
of
the
best
americanmade
schwarzbiersmaybe
even
better
than
sprecher
black
bavarian
which
has
been
my
standard
for
years
a
great
session
lager
for
the
cold
weather
and
unforgettable
with
my
acre
burger
overall
this
is
the
best
schawrzbier
ive
ever
had
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
whenever
i
eat
a
burger
or
a
steak
seek
this
out
and
have
a
session
with
it
overall
interestingly
lager
that
carries
similar
characteristics
as
a
robust
porter
tastes
much
bigger
and
more
adventurous
starts
dry
and
ashen
with
big
bitter
nodes
of
dark
roasted
barley
this
moves
into
a
warmer
lightly
sweeter
middle
which
veers
gorgeously
into
a
medium
hoppy
finish
and
a
wonderful
aftertaste
of
ash
and
peat
excellent
balance
all
throughout
overall
another
nice
beer
had
on
tap
at
the
pub
at
the
university
of
chicago
this
was
served
in
a
large
goblet
and
came
out
completely
black
with
a
light
brown
head
nice
lacing
and
carbonation
very
smoked
malts
even
charred
with
cocoa
and
burnt
toast
at
the
forefront
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
tasty
schwarzbier
with
a
lot
to
recommend
it
o
nice
representation
of
style
tons
of
flavor
easy
drinking
on
draft
at
the
brewpub
this
arrived
a
very
very
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
soapy
head
the
aroma
consists
of
smooth
and
mellow
malt
sweetness
with
an
ever
so
slight
roast
and
a
touch
of
minty
spice
the
flavors
are
of
light
chocolate
grains
light
roast
and
cream
it
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
sessionable
i
really
like
it
its
definitely
a
beer
you
could
drink
for
awhile
excellent
schwarzbier
o
a
pretty
tasty
beer
the
malts
are
huge
and
very
complex
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
stop
by
the
brewpub
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
stronger
offering
than
3
floyds
previous
schwarzbier
ich
bin
schwartz
genüg
für
dich
i
had
no
problem
putting
down
a
pint
of
this
one
and
its
a
beer
id
happily
return
to
during
the
course
of
an
evening
out
o
another
excellent
german
larger
from
fff
almost
more
of
a
traditional
take
on
the
style
with
less
hops
then
i
would
expect
when
all
is
said
and
done
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
it
often
when
at
fff
recommend
very
good
baltimore
based
beer
this
one
is
a
bit
light
in
mouth
feel
there
is
really
nothing
here
to
excite
at
all
the
crack
unleashed
a
squirt
from
the
brimful
can
and
i
could
only
smile
i
upturned
the
can
and
began
an
inverted
glug
producing
a
finger
of
dense
lighttan
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
dark
brown
to
very
dark
brown
srm
27
a
swartzbeir
a
good
beer
but
just
a
bit
too
light
very
drinkable
could
use
a
bit
more
spice
imho
3
75
its
a
pretty
solid
schwarzbier
but
is
a
little
fleeting
with
a
light
body
almost
too
light
still
enjoyable
prost
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
cola
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
smoke
coffee
roasted

taste
is
coffee
up
front
some
smoke
and
roasted
malts
touch
of
hops
mild
bitterness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
pours
out
a
deep
almost
black
brown
with
a
pale
tan
head
no
retention
or
lacing
left
the
aroma
is
pleasant
with
nice
deep
roasted
malt
slight
coffee
and
maybe
some
hints
of
anise
or
liquorice
the
taste
is
really
phenomenal
with
the
roasted
flavors
up
front
and
center
and
a
nice
earthy
hops
in
the
background
there
is
a
pleasant
silky
mouthfeel
and
and
little
bite
from
the
hops
this
is
a
really
good
dark
lager
full
of
flavor
but
not
too
heavy
o
ok
i
had
to
get
this
because
it
was
3
for
a
pint
and
it
is
unions
new
addition
to
their
canning
line
this
was
decent
but
a
bit
bland
pours
a
finer
of
offwhite
head
over
a
clear
very
dark
brown
liquid
smells
dry
coffee
roast
with
a
little
bit
of
cherry
sour
to
the
roast
newspaper
and
mild
earthy
noble
hops
tastes
dry
roast
with
a
mild
sweet
chocolate
playing
underneath
very
light
alcohol
and
absent
of
esters
earthy
hop
bitter
carries
into
the
aftertaste
with
the
lingering
dry
roast
medium
light
in
the
mouth
with
moderate
carbonation
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
beer
is
a
pretty
decent
drinking
for
a
schwarzbier
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
with
a
reddish
black
body
smells
of
coffee
small
bit
of
chocolate
very
inviting
tastes
of
coffee
with
a
good
dark
roasted
malt
body
beer
is
very
light
extremely
drinkable
and
carbonated
well
overall
a
very
good
beer
it
pours
a
cloudy
brown
that
sort
of
belies
the
black
title
its
easy
to
forgive
though
as
aromas
of
roasty
malt
drift
up
to
your
nose
the
taste
is
even
better
roasted
caramel
and
chocolate
with
crisp
and
gentle
hops
for
a
clean
ending
fantastic
amount
of
flavor
for
such
a
light
beer
looks
way
darker
than
it
tastes
hints
of
molasses
good
i
love
the
chive
and
so
i
wanted
to
love
this
beer
but
instead
i
just
like
it
a
little
decent
taste
but
misses
the
mark
overall
but
they
done
good
for
a
first
beer
ill
try
theyre
new
stuff
it
was
ok
not
my
favorite
black
lager
pours
a
very
nice
cleanclear
dark
golden
brown
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
onefinger
fizzy
light
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
which
disappated
quickly
the
nose
is
malty
the
taste
is
malty
not
much
going
on
with
this
one
watery
light
body
with
a
slightly
drybitter
finish
overall
too
macro
for
me
dark
slightly
malty
finishes
with
a
nice
light
hop
memory
very
drinkable
not
a
100
spoton
for
style
but
no
real
complaints
worth
a
try
always
like
a
black
lager
a
style
that
imparts
a
dark
beer
to
a
classic
style
so
lets
give
this
one
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
wafts
of
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
pours
into
my
sapp
a
light
root
beer
color
with
a
multisize
bubble
head
that
recedes
quickly
but
doesnt
lace
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
a
nice
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
up
front
on
the
palate
followed
by
an
ever
so
slightly
bitter
metallic
like
middle
and
a
sweet
yet
slightly
chaulky
bitter
aftertaste
a
very
easy
drinker
with
albeit
more
flavor
in
my
opinion
than
your
runofthemill
lager
a
good
sessioner
i
would
pick
up
again
good
beer
ill
have
one
if
its
on
a
menu
and
nothing
else
appeals
not
too
bad
a
good
effort
like
the
cap
super
dark
mahogany
pour
with
thin
light
tan
head
sweet
and
lightly
toasted
with
a
very
smooth
mouth
feel
very
good
and
closely
resembles
a
sweet
stout
very
easy
to
drink
interesting
an
ok
if
unremarkable
lager
meh
this
is
a
decent
easy
to
drink
black
lager
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
with
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
scent
and
taste
follow
most
black
lagers
malt
with
touches
of
smoke
and
peat
the
body
is
light
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
its
good
love
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
extremely
smooth
and
perfect
for
any
occasion
it
would
sell
as
well
as
a
cheapo
beer
its
like
steve
martin
in
the
jerk
trying
to
be
classy
but
has
no
idea
what
its
doing
this
is
an
ok
offering
not
sure
why
it
took
a
colab
between
resignation
and
red
hook
to
come
up
with
such
a
typical
brew
very
sessionable
perfect
for
quenching
your
thirst
while
shoveling
snow
so
not
quite
a
black
and
not
quite
a
brown
good
malt
favor
and
an
enjoyable
taste
home
run
walk
the
line

a

favorite
black
lager
great
job
on
the
consistency
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
and
it
surprised
me
no
it
isnt
the
best
thing
out
their
but
schwarzbier
is
an
underrepresented
style
that
ive
always
liked
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
that
enjoyed
from
the
12
oz
bottle
in
an
elevator
brewing
company
pint
glass
this
nice
black
lager
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
tinges
a
nice
frothy
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
and
clinging
fine
beaded
lacing

the

and
sides
light

bitterness
to
the
rear
with
some
roasted

flavors
following
through
on
the
aftertaste
leaving
a
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
blending
with
roasted
coffee
very
sessionable
black
lager
with
a
wet
smooth

feel
nice
solid
collaboration
beer
it
has
a
great
taste
and
it
has
great
flavors
of
oak
barrel
taste
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
to
this
beer
it
tastes
fine
but
is
lacking
the
toasted
maltiness
and
flavor
of
coffee
was
hoping
for
a
little
bit
more
out
of
this
one
3
31
with
beeradvocate
formula
aka
66100
it
essentially
has
the
general
feel
of
a
watered
down
porter
as
others
have
said
before
but
it
would
be
a
great
alternative
for
somebody
who
is
a
fan
of
guinness
it
may
have
a
chocolate
or
coffee
note
at
the
beginning
but
has
a
mild
tart
finish
that
reminds
me
of
licorice
my
favorite
beers
are
ipas
but
this
is
a
pleasant
change
and
if
my
local
distributor
still
has
it
on
sale
at
17
and
change
i
would
but
another
case
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
people
complain
about
the
lightness
of
this
stoutlike
lager
but
i
think
it
is
a
unique
perspective
and
good
in
its
own
right
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
on
a
full
flavored
black
lager
yet
is
lighter
then
most
porter
or
stout
beers
this
lager
is
a
great
dark
beer
to
get
wasted
on
very
comparable
too
guinness
this
stuff
tastes
like
a
good
stout
or
porter
that
is
watered
down
and
leaves
you
hanging
i
was
told
over
and
over
that
this
is
good
stuff
so
i
dropped
9
bucks
on
a
sixxer
and
was
seriously
disappointed
high
price
for
a
lager
that
tastes
like
watered
down
chocolate
and
coffee
wont
buy

quick
nothing
i
wished
for
in
a
beer
i
dreamed
about
huge
hype
around
this
beer
begin
as
its
the
beer
of
the
chive
cracked
the
bottle
and
immediately
got
smacked
with
a
delightful
smell
of
bold
dark
flavors
and
hints
of
coffee
but
the
taste
dosnt
compare
leaves
you
wanting
more
wishing
it
had
that
one
last
thing
to
make
it
a
great
beer
it
begs
for
a
bite
at
the
end
and
it
dosnt
deliver
and
to
add
to
the
all
around
flavor
its
flat
as
a
pancake
very
let
down
by
this
beer
o
a
solid
beer
but
definitely
forgettable
sure
its
a
little
light
in
body
that
is
well
within
the
style
profile
so
im
ok
with
that
taste
mouthfeel
aroma
and
appearance
are
just
what
id
look
for
in
a
black
lager
perfect
for
a
fall

overall

for

the

youre
looking

bohemian
black
has
been
the
best
ive
tried
thus
far
ive
still
yet
to
try
n
b
s

so
im
still
optimistic
my
advice
skip
this
hybrid
the
look
of
a
porter
with
the
taste
and
feel
of
a
mass
produced
lager
meh
a
thin
brown
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
there
isnt
a
lot
of
smell
but
most
of
what
i
get
is
malt
the
taste
was
very
underwhelming
with
a
bit
of
malt
a
spike
of
hops
and
then
a
semi
sweet
aftertaste
was
not
a
fan
myself
and
found
this
beer
to
be
highly
forgettable
crisp
carbonated
light
porter
taste
all
after
taste
no
this
beer
should
not
be
allowed
on
the
market
o
no
flaws
it
just
needs
the
body
to
match
the
smell
as
is
its
a
touch
thin

something
i

occasionally
indulging

goes

not

good
representation

this
is
a

beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
promising
aroma
leads
to
just
a
decent
flavor
the
smooth
malts
in
the
smell
get
mixed

with

profile
and
it
feels
a

watered
down
o

taste
without
the
porter
feel
i
enjoy
chocolatey
porters
more
than
any
other
beer
i
honestly
wasnt
expecting
that
flavor
with
this
beer
i
was
just
expecting
a
regular
lager
that
happened
to
have
a
dark
color
i
was
greatly
surprised
and
pleased
on
a
hot
day
like
today
its
refreshing
to
get
such
flavor
from
a

a

this

it

like

some

notes
find
their

well
overall
i
was
not
impressed
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
the
fullbodied
experience
i
was
expecting
its
ok
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
a
few
days
ago
the
first
one
i
tried
seemed
to
be
overly
toasted
to
the
point
of
tasting
like
coffee
thats
been
on
the
burner
too
long
i
dont
know
if
theres
some
variety
between
bottles
but
this
particular
beer
lacked
the
overtoasted
charred
flavor
or
perhaps
the
biscuit
just
balanced
out
the
toastiness
better
above
average
scores
all
around
not
a
bad
beer
it
s
dark
it
black
i
right
to
the
point
there
nothing
hiding
in
the
beer
if
you
like
this
kind
of
beer
then
grab
a
six
pack
taste
great
going
down
and
loooks
great
in
a
glass
the
the
darkness
you
deserves
it
a
black
lager
that
you
can
enjoy
anytime
i
know
i
will
im
starting
to
get
into
black
lagers
more
and
more
now
so
i
will
revisit
this
beer
later
and
see
how
i
feel
about
it
the
label
reads
black
lager
though
this
is
reminiscent
of
a
brown
ale
roasted
malt
caramelmolasses
sweetness
and
faint
nuttiness
not
bad
at
all
bottle
at
the
local
bww
this
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
burnt
malt
the
taste
is
smooth
and
simple
but
very
drinkable
there
is
a
slight
chive
finish
but
nothing
over
the
top
simple
and
nice
this
beer
had
its
moments
some
good
things
and
bad
things
but
ill
finish
my
sixpack
and
move
on
the
taste
profile
could
be
smoothed
out
a
little
but
everything
good
is
there
the
taste
is
good
with
dark
toasted
grain
and
nutty
flavor
with
light
caramel
accents
and
light
hint
of
nutty
toffee
with
some
earthy
and
dry
finish
with
almost
spicy
taste
from
high
carbonation
the
overall
take
is
it
is
a
decent
dark
lager
with
some
interesting
malt
yet
it
is
not
really
a
standout
style

easydrinking

a

brew
to

or
a

starts
off
with
a
good
look
and
a
decent
smell
however
the
overall
taste
disappointed
me
for
a
lager
as
dark
as
it
was
i
expected
more
however
what
i
found
was
a
beer
that
tasted
watered
down
honestly
it
could
have
been
a
very
good
beer
it
had
all
the
elements
in
place
but
something
in
the
process
held
it
back
a
little
more
heft
and
a
little
more
kick
and
they
might
have
something
good
not
bad
but
certainly
not
great
mediocre
at
best
keep
calm
and
chive
on
overall
its
pretty
decent
i
wouldnt
call
this
beer
bad
its
quite
good
actually
but
ive
had
some
very
remarkable
stuff
so
its
up
against
some
stiff
competition
ive
been
wanting
to
try
to
for
awhile
glad
i
came
across
it
id
have
it
again
but
nothing
im
going
to
seek
out
overall
not
bad
but
it
feels
more
along
the
lines
of
a
standard
dark
lager
and
not
so
much
a
fullon
schwarzbier
overall
it
was
not
bad
a
good
darkblack
lager
however
darkblack
lagers
are
a
in
between
category
to
me
this
one
is
not
a
porter
not
a
stout
but
is
trying
to
be
both
however
its
lower
abv
and
ibus
so
its
highly
sessionable
which
is
good
but
at
10
bucks
a
sixer
not
so
good
i
would
rather
have
my
go
to
porter
edmund
fitzgerald
which
is
a
buck
cheaper
and
worlds
better
this
was
a
good
beer
but
this
black
lager
just
makes
me
want
a
porter
or
stout
o
i
am
an
unabashed
chiver
but
did
not
expect
much
here
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
but
that
does
not
mean
the
craft
world
will
love
this
one
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
and
a
good
brew
to
enjoy
on
a
picnic
or
a
hot
day
i
dug
it
and
the
wife
loved
it
and
well
that
helps
me
out
worth
a
try
nice
for
a
dark
american
lager
but
a
pretty
bland
beer
overall
crystal
clear
pour
with
rapidly
fading
head
from
a
12oz
bottle
pleasant
roasted
taste
notes
of
chocolate
flavor
thin

with

above

overall
its
a
fine
american
dark
lager
overall
ok
nice
malt
profile
but
a
little
thin
and
watery
and
little
yeasty
nothing
too
special
as
a
fan
of
the
chive
i
wanted
to
give
the
kcco
black
lager
a
try
when
i
saw
it
in
my
local
bottle
shop
as
a
whole
i
am
not
much
of
a
fan
of
black
lagers
anyways
but
still
kept
an
open
mind
and
didnt
expect
anything
earth
shattering
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
as
i
either
got
an
infected
bottle
or
this
is
just
a
mindnumbingly
bad
beer
tasted
and
smelled
of
roasted
ammonia
two
sips
and
i
had
to
tap
out
hope
it
didnt
kill
the
grass
where
i
dumped
it
over
my
deck
the
dark
malts
are
more
notable
in
the
taste
but
something
still
seems
a
little
bit
off
it
evolves
to
a
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
relatively
drinkable

dark

malt

i
expected

medium

with
a

less

i
usually
expect
from
the
style
o
seems
like
a
massproduced
product
vice
a
craft
brew
a
little
bland
for
me
the
light
carbonation
supports
some
crispness
in
a
light
body
its
a
bit
smooth
but
it
could
use
more
than
just
simplicity
to
make
it
lighter
and
join
the
ranks
of

a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
pretty
sweet
in
the
flavors
ok
so
im
suppose
to
tell
you
why
i
dislike
or
like
it
and
be
constructive
too
it
is
basic
light
on
carbonation
lacking
in
aroma
and
has
a
mediocre
flavor
compared
to
others
in
its
class
like
good
schwartzbier
or
a
complex
black
lager
rjt
overall
this
beer
was
too
harsh
all
around
feeling
like
a
cola
with
a
macro
brewery
taste
decent
mouthfeel
here
but
it
is
not
a
very
drinkable
black
lager
because
it
doesnt
create
any
excitement
for
my
palate
i
am
going
to
say
that
this
is
a
skip
going
forward
a
solid
black
lager
not
great
but
definitely
not
bad
had
higher
hopes
being
a
chiver
and
unfortunately
this
beer
fell
a
little
short
not
great
flavor
almost
watered
down
to
be
honest
a
decent
finish
to
it
improvements
could
definitely
be
made
not
a
go
to
for
me
but
a
novelty
at
the
least
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
foamy
head
and
some
persistent
lacing
nose
is
lightly
roasty
with
a
bit
of
a
floral
tone
rye
bread
with
a
little
peat
overall
this
is
decent
quaff
as
a
few
others
have
noted
this
beer
will
not
win
any
awards
but
it
certainly
isnt
a
waste
of
your
time
or
money
unless
you
are
a
snob
with
unreasonably
high
standards
not
bad
at
all
seems
to
taste
even
better
when
wearing
my
bfm
shirt
and
looking
at
flbp
smells
and
tastes
kind
of
roasty
has
a
nice
drunkness
effect
after
4
or
5
much
better
than
any
macro
but
still
perfectly
drinkable
dare
i
say
it
has
drinkability
pick
up
a
6
and
keep
5
for
yourself
or
fewer
if
you
have
more
friends
than
me
rak
it
kcco
is
not
going
to
blow
a
seasoned
beer
drinker
out
of
the
water
but
the
easy
going
nature
and
pleasant
malt
flavors
should
keep
one
interested
enough
to
enjoy
i
would
gladly
have
this
again
drinkable
as
hell
overall
pretty
tasty
still
not
going
to
replace
kona
porter
in
my
refrigerator
tasty
yet
somewhat
weak
overall
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
and
comes
across
somewhat
weak
after
the
initial
impact
wears
off
decent
enough
but
not
a
musthave
overall
incredibly
average
probably
wont
buy
again
a
collaboration
with
red
hook
make
your
own
judgments
on
their
direction
a
beer
for
the
chive
which
is
apparently
some
college
kid
website
i
dont
know
what
i
do
know
is
that
this
brew
is
hopelessly
average
its
a
dark
amber
color
not
black
and
has
about
an
inch
of
caramel
colored
head
but
it
fades
fast
light
and
easy
drinking
the
lager
characteristics
are
quite
pronounced
with
just
a
medium
roast
on
the
malt
and
a
bit
of
a
watered
down
vibe
easy
enough
to
drink
and
not
off
in
any
way
but
boring
in
terms
of
flavor
a
little
sweet
quick
finish
one
thing
i
will
say
for
it
though
is
that
at
least
its
a
dark
beer
i
mean
there
are
enough
crappy
low
budget
college
guy
beers
out
there
i
am
glad
they
went
a
different
direction
with
this
but
it
offers
just
a
few
of
the
elements
of
a
truly
craft
black
lager
or
a
german
schwarzbier
this
doesnt
have
any
of
the
richness
or
the
grain
character
but
it
gets
a
passing
low
c
grade
from
me
bland
nothing
about
this
brew
makes
me
want
to
drink
it
again
but
its
ok
ill
keep
calm
and
chive
on
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
mahogany
amber
with
a
fine
one
finger
very
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
mild
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
with
bare
hints
of
toastiness
similar
to
an
average
lager
flavor
also
mild
light
toasted
biscuit
malt
slightly
sweet
finishes
with
a
suggestion
of
grassy
hops
surprisingly
medium
body
with
hints
of
creaminess
a
very
subdued
and
bland
schwarzbier
touching
on
but
not
grasping
the
elements
of
the
style
an
odd
mild
astringency
in
the
finish
that
would
not
have
been
a
problem
with
a
bit
more
robust
flavor
contract
brewed
by
redhook
and
the
kind
of
safe
bland
beer
ive
come
to
expect
from
them
days
since
there
were
no
reviews
of
this
i
did
some
internet
searching
to
try
to
find
out
more
about
this
odd
beer
that
someone
at
a
craft
beer
store
just
gave
me
i
think
it
was
a
review
bottle
everything
about
it
seems
to
be
a
sea
of
red
flags
it
is
apparently
a
brewery
launched
as
part
a
branding
exercise
for
a
website
the
chive
that
specializes
in
boob
photography
but
in
a
ironic
way
understand
i
have
nothing
against
boobs
nor
their
photography
but
it
does
not
necessarily
bode
well
that
a
craft
beer
was
chosen
as
a
adjunct
to
the
project
unless
there
is
some
brewing
vision
they
named
themselves
resignation
brewery
although
there
is
no
brewery
and
this
is
produced
by
redhook
the
choice
of
redhook
which
once
but
no
longer
really
has
much
craft
beer
following
and
has
become
rather
pedestrian
is
not
promising
then
the
website
is
simply
a
graphic
of
a
running
ostrich
thats
it
branding
no
text
or
information
further
internet
research
finds
lots
of
news
releases
on
the
chive
group
starting
brewing
but
virtually
nothing
beyond
boilerplate
about
the
beer
or
why
they
were
motivated
to
start
brewing
beyond
expanding
the
brand
sorry
but
brands
without
content
or
purpose
are
not
of
interest
to
me
so
i
guess
if
you
are
a
chive
fan
and
appreciate
the
ironic
premise
of
the
site
this
may
well
be
an
excellent
brew
to
quaff
while
perusing
the
site
otherwise
treat
it
like
any
other
redhook
beer
or
branding
exercise
not
too
bad
for
a
mild
intro
level
schwarzbier
no
major
flaws
as
i
would
expect
from
redhook
otherwise
only
chive
fans
and
sad
ass
tickers
like
me
should
apply
here
its
worth
checking
the
website
right
now
for
a
great
example
of
vacuous
information
very
dark
brown
thin
white
head
nice
chocolately
aroma
milder
taste
good
balance
of
sweet
and
dry
medium
bodied
silky
body
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
a
schwarzbier
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
when
it
came
down
it
i
found
myself
wishing
that
the
roasted
aspects
werent
so
covered
up
by
the
other
aspects
but
i
thought
the
rest
of
this
beer
was
pretty
well
done
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
creamy
a
little
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
so
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
i
dont
have
any
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
they
were
both
good
and
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
roasted
malt
aspects
were
very
restrained
and
i
wish
they
showed
up
more
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
and
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
great
example
of
a
schwarzbier
but
if
you
really
like
the
style
then
its
worth
trying
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
it
was
solid
but
it
still
needed
some
work
its
not
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
would
say
its
just
little
above
average
for
the
style
i
think
its
solid
but
with
a
little
more
work
it
could
be
very
nice
better
luck
next
time
guys
a
lot
lighter
than
it
looks
some
chocolate
sweetness
that
is
nicely
countered
by
dry
a
dryer
finish
very
drinkable
overall
really
sweet
toasted
great
flavors
i
give
this
beer
excellent
marks
not
only
for
its
complexity
and
drinkability
but
also
its
price
only
3something
for
the
bottle
which
will
be
refilled
many
times
with
homebrew
purchased
at
hennessey
grocery
in
butte
montana
dark
black
in
color
and
barely
penetrable
to
light
light
brussels
lacing
a
fingernail
of
khaki
head
covers
less
than
a
third
of
the
top
of
the
beer
i
smell
plenty
of
dark
and
sweet
mat
theres
a
hint
of
smoke
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
comprised
of
sweetdark
malt
the
mouth
is
slightly
sticky
for
a
lagerbut
it
is
due
to
all
of
that
darksweet
malt
overall
not
bad
but
not
what
i
expected
not
very
good
either
for
a
german
beer
plenty
of
nice
toasty
malts
but
lots
of
grainy
husky
wheat
and
hay
like
flavors
not
what
i
expected
for
a
schwarzbier
also
no
real
dark
malt
notes
other
than
some
caramel
and
lager
notes
arent
the
best
even
the
nice
smooth
soft
feel
was
quite
nice
and
what
i
expect
from
a
beer
like
this
but
the
rest
was
meh
o
really
good
well
done
overall
pretty
cool
schwarzbier
that
i
have
never
seen
before
found
it
in
jp
and
figured
i
really
dont
have
much
to
lose
i
could
enjoy
more
of
these
in
the
future

still
nice
schwarzbier
that
popped
up
in

and
is
apparently
a
one

arrival
ill
have
it
again

very

easy

tasty
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
the
taste
lacks
complexity
taste
wise
it
came
to
life
a
little
malty
semisweet
and
lively
in
the
mouth
feel
ive
struggled
with
this
style
before
having
trouble
finding
any
strong
flavours
and
any
depth
this
was
better
than
most
far
from
robust
and
flavoursome
it
did
however
have
something
about
it
there
are
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
in
the
taste
and
it
does
feel
a
little
richer
than
most
german
black
lagers
ive
encounted
considering
the
price
less
than
two
pounds
this
was
a
good
deal
o
ive
had
a
couple
of
schwarzbiers
and
they
all
seem
to
have
this
same
bland
yet
smooth
flavor
and
aromas
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
in
it
really
stands
out
light
on
the
palate
the
flavors
all
meld
together
so
well
that
you
can
enjoy
it
all
in
harmony
without
thinking
about
it
though
it
is
more
fun
to
do
so
i
could
drink
this
with
a
chocolate
mousse
a
burger
or
down
a
few
of
them
just
for
fun
not
overly
complex
but
i
think
thats
the
point
overall
an
ok
beer
didnt
blow
me
away
or
else
would
have
it
again
but
in
somebody
else
dime
rich

the

i
could
make
this
my

beer

it
was

overall
an
incredibly
standard
schwarzbier
welldone
but
nothing
special
very
interesting
style
ill
look
out
for
more
blackbeers
in
the
future
drinkability
a
good
sipping
beer
sweetness
of
the
malts
not
too
strong
and
a
slight
essence
of
the
hops
to
let
you
know
they
are
there
but
not
so
pronounce
as
to
deviate
from
style
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
the
appearance
was
great
but
thats
where
it
ended
this
brew
is
light
in
alcohol
but
full
in
body
definitely
this
is
good
to
go
with
venison
or
some
smoked
cheddar
drinkable
but
not
character
drinkable
but
anonymous
this
was
a
good
black
beer
but
is
by
no
means
the
best
almost
black
with
light
tan
head
and
good
lacing
smells
spicy
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
taste
is
very
sweet
with
little
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
mediudfull
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
i
could
not
drink
it
too
often
taste
is
sweet
malty
litle
oxidised
but
still
fresh
mostly
cause
there
seems
to
be
a
lemonlime
arome
with
it
aftertaste
misses
litle
bitterness
but
is
clean
and
sweet
the
thickness
opf
the
brew
makes
mouthfeel
ok
but
it
misses
some
bitterness
in
my
opinion
drinks
easy
but
sweetness
is
so
big
that
for
me
this
0
5l
botle
was
enough
good
beer
especially
for
sombody
who
likes
it
sweet
and
without
to
much
bitterness
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
several
actually
and
would
pick
it
up
if
i
ever
see
it
again

overall
quite

roasty
taste
is

a

takes
charge
and
ruins
the
followthrough
ok
offering
but
not
great
fine
hop
character
just
wish
they
would
lose
the
metal
taste
from
the
descriptions
i
should
have
loved
this
beer
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
great
for
cooking
when
poured
over
ribs
okay
for
drinking
when
poured
into

mouth

a
decent
try
but
shiner
definitely
has
this
one
beat
i
like
the
flavors
more
and
the
roast
comes
out
better
in
shiners
version
this
beer
focuses
more
on
milk
and
honey
aspects
not
so
much
on
the
roast

toast
its
still
a

overall

all
around
good

and

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
what
a
fantastic
black
lager
the
best
of
both
worlds
here
almost
as
much
a
baltic
porter
as
a
schwarzbier
really
robust
malt
profile
earthy
and
heavily
roasted
with
a
nutty
middle
and
a
lot
of
body
for
such
a
quick
finish
dark
in
color
too
pushing
black
with
a
matte
finish
well
carbonated
and
thin
on
the
head
it
smells
nutty
and
toasty
like
good
roasted
barley
but
not
bitter
or
super
dense
like
some
can
be
this
stays
light
while
holding
onto
that
extremely
deep
dark
grain
element
really
a
great
success
here
lager
yeast
has
a
lot
of
flavor
this
time
around
and
with
the
dark
malt
its
like
the
burnt
flakes
on
the
crust
of
a
properly
cooked
wood
fired
pizza
it
has
that
char
and
dough
thing
working
well
for
it
hoppy
too
for
an
almost
macro
brew
biting
in
the
finish
more
than
balancing
to
the
flavoring
level
but
its
all
in
excellent
proportion
lively
carbonation
makes
it
feel
rather
light
for
its
color
and
it
ends
up
being
a
sessionable
and
quenching
drink
sam
adams
has
some
really
solid
basic
beers
in
their
lineup
and
this
is
a
prime
example
that
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
complex
to
be
delicious
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
like
that
interesting
twist
of
this
dark
beer
very
interesting
flavor
not
very
easy
to
describe
complex
yet
smooth
it
has
the
malty
flavor
you
expect
from
a
dark
beer
but
different
from
a
porter
or
stout
i
would
definitely
drink
this
brew
again
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
xingu
grabbed
a
six
pack
for
my
wife
because
she
enjoyed
the
guinness
black
lager
so
much
and
i
was
sick
of
her
drinking
my
beers
pours
very
black
with
a
light
caramel
hue
it
goes
down
smooth
maybe
not
quite
as
smooth
as
the
guinness
black
but
there
is
a
lot
more
flavor
here
than
from
guinness
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
drinks
well
and
has
a
lot
of
flavor
good
brew
for
a
quiet
monday
night

this
beer
has
a
nice
drinkable
feel
like
most
largers
with
this
same
amount
of
alcohol
it
has
a
medium
to
lighter
body
and
is
smooth
going
down
overall
i
will
remember
this
beer
for
its
roasted
toasty
profile
pretty
flavorful
pours
a
dark
brown
like
cola
a
12
finger
beige
head
is
seen
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
lots
going
on
with
the
aroma
with
burnt
brown
sugar
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
even
more
going
on
with
the
taste
and
sweeter
than
excepted
very
nice
balance
of
flavors
as
well
as
perfect
carbonation
one
of
the
better
black
lagers
for
sure
oa
great
schwarz
bier
sam
adams
does
knock
out
of
the
park
rare
hardly
done
styles
in
america
i
must
say
black
lager
is
not
a
regrettable
purchase
but
it
could
be
better
you
do
get
a
smoked
sense
with
the
brew
that
is
pleasant
but
drink
quickly
and
one
bottle
at
a
time
because
the
qualities
will
evaporate
flavors
will
die
and
carbonation
disappears
drink
this
decent
beer
i
say
still
and
search
out
for
authentic
imported
schwarz
biers
o
pretty
good
beer
better
than
i
expected
drinkable
but
nice
roastiness
and
flavors
o
a
decent
beer
very
drinkable
but
altogether
not
something
particularly
special
this
is
mostly
a
rate
from
memory
as
i
have
not
seen
this
one
in
a
while
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
slightly
brownish
off
white
head
aroma
is
dark
malty
chocolate
some
definite
roast
with
bite
that
makes
it
not
super
sweet
flavor
follows
closely
with
big
roast
and
a
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
interestingly
i
didnt
get
much
smoke
from
this
more
roast
to
me
rather
rich
mouthfeel
for
the
abv
and
a
pretty
solid
brew
decent
schwarzbier
with
a
twist
hard
to
identify
maybe
a
late
smokiness
and
hop
of
choice
or
ratio
a
beer
that
grows
over
time
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
heavy
enough
to
know
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
although
i
didnt
like
the
soapy
flavours
i
had
a
great
pour
with
a
resultant
two
fingers
of
deeptan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
garnet
highlights
and
seemingly
good
clarity
allowing
for
its
extremely
dark
color
nose
smelled
of
cocoa
powder
and
i
was
reminded
of
my
lunch
duty
partner
who
seems
to
to
really
dig
on
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
definite
cocoasmoky
taste
on
the
tongue
she
claims
not
to
like
beer
but
i
would
bet
that
she
would
totally
dig
this
for
me
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
but
not
cloying
which
i
really
dislike
finish
was
semisweet
and
a
decent
drink
for
the
style
even
if
not
my
bag
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
and
plentiful
rising
bubbles
in
the
beer
the
head
recedes
somewhat
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
behind
on
the
glass
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
glass
during
consumption
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
toffee
chocolate
and
some
hints
of
spiciness
from
the
hop
varieties
that
were
selected
spalt
and
hallertau
mittelfruh
the
flavor
is
malty
with
some
mild
toffee
mild
chocolate
water
and
some
hop
spiciness
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
coffee
notes
dark
but
not
heavy
easy
to
drink
and
very
smooth
for
a
dark
beer
does
not
come
around
often
so
grab
some
if
you
see
them
overall
a
solid
dark
beer
option
and
in
the
same
vein
of
some
of
my
favorite
import
schwarzbiers
this
still
tastes
like
an
american
take
on
the
style
tasty
beer
o
a
really
bizarre
schwarz
from
sa
too
many
off
characteristics
that
didnt
work
to
be
considered
a
truly
good
beer
not
a
repeat
buy
pours
nice
very
black
opaque
nice
foamy
head
with
decent
retention
what
hit
me
first
again
was
burnt
overwhelming
burnt
notes
taste
was
the
same
i
couldnt
even
call
it
smoky
really
some
malty
flavor
in
there
maybe
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
toffee
seems
a
bit
sour
as
well
especially
as
it
warmed
up
i
am
not
seeing
how
this
example
matches
with
the
definition
of
the
style
i
didnt
find
any
hops
character
to
it
other
than
being
light
on
the
mouth
feel
and
wellcarbonated
i
dont
see
it
fitting
the
overall
style
not
to
say
much
about
this
guy
had
it
a
few
times
in
sampler
packs
dark
beer
the
flavor
is
okay
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
but
its
worth
a
try
made
black
and
blues
with
it
before
def
not
as
thick
or
rich
as
other
beers
that
would
have
worked
better
with
that
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
after
taste
pretty
good
schwarzbier
o
excellent
balance
of
sweet
with
low
roast
and
mild
hop
this
is
a
stout
without
the
stoutiness
a
great
beer
to
introduce
a
neophyte
to
something
with
character
this
seems
like
a
truly
americanized
version
of
the
schwarzbier
style
o
refreshing
and
light
alternative
to
heavier
porters
and
stouts
i
like
this
o
nothing
special
ok
with
salty
and
smoked
food
overall
a
solid
schwarzbier
would
recommend
to
tohers
overall
not
bad
but
could
use
some
better
flavoring
maybe
a
bit
stronger
on
the
carmels
and
toasted
malts
overall
while
the
beer
isnt
quite
as
black
in
appearance
as
the
name
suggests
the
initial
aromas
were
promising
and
savory
however
the
flavors
proved
watery
especially
over
the
course
of
several
mouthfuls
and
the
watery
mouthfeel
further
took
away
from
the
overall
package
decent
fare
and
likely
excellent
entrylevel
beer
for
anyone
making
the
transition
into
craft
beers
due
to
its
approachability
and
the
fact
that
it
wont
blast
your
palate
silly
but
doesnt
quite
keep
up
with
its
heavierhitting
peers

overall
feels
like
a

much
like
a

a
deep
black
with
brownish

that
appear
clear
with
a
tan

aroma
and
body
virtually
match

no
sweetness
in

finishes
almost
watery
though
for
so
much
roasted
nature
almost
like
a
nitro
guinness
good
enough
overall
its
an
incredibly
tasty
beer
with
the
right
aromas
and
feels
that
makes
it
almost
perfect
overall
this
is
a
definite
hit
from
the
sam
adams
collection
and
you
wont
regret
buying
one
ill
buy
one
again
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
mouthfeel
and
overall
very
lightbodied
and
lightly
carbonated
watery
at
first
but
a
nice
smokey
chocolate
malt
backs
it
up
a
bit
in
the
end
with
respect
this
beer
is
not
terribly
great
but
it
is
certainly
better
and
contains
more
of
a
body
than
the
dixi
black
voodoo
i
just
had
not
too
long
ago
o
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
suitable
for
winter
or
summer
it
has
the
characteristics
of
porters
or
stouts
but
is
much
lighter
and
versatile
a
great
offering
from
boston
beer
co
makes
for
a
decent
desert
or
goes
well
with
a
chocolate
donut
made
to
be
drunk
on
a
cold
night
which
it
complements
well
o
mild
but
flavorful
and
smooth
drinking
one
of
my
personal
favorites
from
the
boston
beer
company
i
enjoy
this
anytime
of
the
year
and
highly
recommend
it
not
sure
how
it
represents
the
style
because
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
but
a
delicious
beer
none
the
less
a
deep
dark
blackbrown
color
small
off
white
head
an
amazing
smell
of
dark
breads
and
roasted
grains
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
brilliant
light
body
to
balance
out
the
heavy
smell
and

a
great

quaffable

overall
i
dont
know
if
this
represents
the
style
well
or
not
but
its
a
very
good
brew
regardless
goes
down
quick
and
easy
o
probably
one
of
sam
adams
best
definitely
one
to
have
in
the
fridge
full
flavored
not
terribly
expensive
or
hard
to
get
very
nice
offering
by
samuel
adams
rich
and
roasty
lager
with
an
uplifting
character
that
does
well
to
adapt
to
the
seasons
curbing
the
sloppy
finish
with
the
tartness
and
stick
would
help
this
alot
i
came
away
fairly
impressed
o
a
decent
very
drinkable
beer
somewhat
simplistic
on
the
palate
but
not
flawed
either
certainly
not
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
but
very
approachable
overall
decent
attempt
but
nothing
special
the
czech
and
the
germans
do
this
type
of
beer
much
better
overall
this
is
truly
a
solid
beer
offering
from
the
boston
beer
company
i
have
been
a
little
disappointed
in
some
of
their
beers
in
that
brewers
collection
but
this
one
is
good
nothing
to
really
freak
out
about
but
a
solid
beer
very
drinkable
something
a
little
different
for
an
avid
dark
beer
fan
a
solid
beer
at
a
solid
price
from
a
solid
brewery
what
more
you
want
o
my
least
favorite
from
sam
adams
so
far
it
seems
to
follow
style
but
this
really
isnt
that
drinkable
or
good
in
my
opinion
d
easy
drinker
for
sure
overall
its
very
drinkable
but
decidedly
average
a
nice
beer
it
is
very
light
and
refreshing
yet
enjoyable
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
its
nice
that
such
a
common
brewery
has
brewed
a
style
that
is
rather
uncommon
o
excellent
dark
beer
for
the
price
overall
not
bad
at
all
pick
it
up
watch
a
movie
or
smoke
a
cigar
this
beer
is
only
missing
one
thing
you
salud
it
was
a
good
match
with
some
egg
rolls
and
duck
sauce
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
amber
almost
black
smells
of
a
coffee
with
toffee
pretty
sweet
but
not
that
strong
tastes
of
coffee
but
not
overly
strong
and
a
little
toffee
notes
very
pleasant
carbonation
is
light
which
leads
to
a
smooth
finish
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
great
toneddown
version
of
a
classic
stout
there
isnt
a
better
term
than
black
lager
bitter
yet
still
a
little
sweet
refreshing
and
finishes
moderately
good
beer
o
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
highly
drinkable
and
not
too
high
on
the
abv
makes
this
is
great
widely
available
brew
great
job
sam
adams
overall
a
really
good
beer
and
great
for
the
style
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
o
enjoyed
this
one
taste
is
reminiscent
of
many
stouts
but
has
a
somewhat
lighter
character
which
sets
it
apart
from
those
beers
very
drinkable
and
would
definitely
have
again
d
it
needs
some
work
a
good
foundation
but
thats
all
it
is
at
this
point
one
of
the
better
schwarzes
ive
come
across
in
bottled
form
very
organized
flavors
rich
and
robust
for
just
4
90
abv
a
great
session
beer
anytime
of
the
year
i
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
overall
a
solid
showing
goes
down
easy
but
still
has
considerable
character
the
roastyness
and
maltyness
really
stand
out
in
this
beer
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
boston
beer
co
o
good
brew
that
did
not
let
down
in
the
mixer
i
could
definitely
come
back
to
these
pretty
solid
black
tone
purpleish
in
light
good
beige
head
great
lacing
on
the
sip
smell
is
mostly
a
burnt
malt
with
a
fatty
sweetness
to
it
faint
herbal
hop
characters
but
barely
taste
is
balanced
but
a
bit
plain
just
some
burnt
malt
and
a
bit
high
on
carb
overall
missing
something
o
very
nice
beer
i
have
only
had
a
few
schwarzbiers
before
and
this
one
was
cleaner
and
maltier
than
the
others
ive
had
my
favorite
part
of
this
one
is
that
the
chocolate
and
roast
really
only
added
to
a
really
solid
malt
backbone
a
lot
of
malt
flavor
packed
into
a
low
abv
crisp
lager
a
very
respectable
dark
lager
nicely
balanced
and
easy
drinking
a
nice
beer
that
is
part
of
the
sampler
pack
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
have
no
problem
finishing
off
the
rest
from
the
sampler
pack
this
should
be
their
winter
beer
better
than
the
winter
lager
this
is
a
filling
beer
tastes
good
a
little
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
i
would
like
more
roasted
flavor
this
is
a
quality
beer
i
would
enjoy
drinking
and
would
be
proud
to
give
to
a
friend
o
solid
drinker
it
tastes
alright
and
goes
down
easily
o
balance
not
heavy
not
light
not
bitter
not
sweet
not
complex
not
simple
i
think
koch
and
the
crew
got
it
right
ive
always
liked
this
beer
since
i
think
smell
is
a
lesser
category
overall
boosts
to
a
4
at
4
9
it
makes
a
great
session
beer
cheers
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
very
good
very
refreshing
and
very
smooth
very
good
overall
not
bad
the
flavor
is
present
but
finishes
a
bit
watery
very
easy
drinking
schwarzbier
notes
a
nice
drinkable
schwarzbier
do
a
fine
beer
but
by
craft
beer
standards
its
pretty
mediocre
id
have
another
but
i
wont
specifically
seek
this
out
o
before
i
really
got
into
craft
beer
fulltime
i
used
to
always
say
that
this
was
my
favorite
from
the
sa
mix
packs
im
happy
to
report
that
after
about
1000000
beers
later
this
one
still
has
it
would
probably
not
go
looking
for
this
one
again
its
perfectly
fine
but
there
are
better
schwarzbiers
out
there
its
great
to
see
my
dad
branching
out
a
little
bit
in
his
beer
purchases
and
im
excited
to
be
able
to
show
him
a
little
bit
of
the
ba
world
this
beer
reminds
me
that
i
really
do
need
to
take
the
time
to
review
more
sam
adams
offerings
i
am
very
rarely
disappointed
with
the
quality
of
their
beers
and
my
experience
with
their
black
lager
is
no
exception
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
almost
completely
black
with
just
a
thin
white
head
a
little
lace
smell
bakers
chocolate
biscuit
and
carmel
taste
is
mainly
the
chocolate
very
one
dimensional
body
is
very
thin
for
a
chocolate
tasting
beer
lots
of
carbonation
lush
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
simple
strait
forward
beer
probably
a
good
beer
to
start
off
your
craft
beer
adventure
smells
of
dark
fruit
and
burnt
coffee
pours
a
pretty
clear
brown
color
with
amber
tints
and
a
massive
fluffy
off
white
head
thin
mouthfeel
but
the
flavors
are
good
and
well
blended
nice
thin
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
on
the
side
of
the
mouth
with
a
very
modest
clean
finish
of
coffee
and
balancing
hops
very
good
in
flavors
that
are
blended
together
well
but
the
watery
body
doesnt
do
justice
to
how
much
better
it
couldve
balance
is
there
and
all
it
just
needs
a
richer
body
the
thinness
of
the
beer
really
hurt
this
one
unfortunately
o
a
pretty
good
brew
taste
was
not
as
deep
as
i
had
expected
from
the
nose
but
it
was
still
nice
carbonation
was
far
too
intense
in
my
opinion
o
a
fine
beer
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
on
its
own
but
im
okay
with
a
couple
thrown
into
the
variety
packs
from
time
to
time
overall
among
the
better
sam
adams
beers
for
sure
definitely
the
best
in
the
brewers
choice
12pack
onto
the
beer
black
in
color
as
the
name
suggestions
great
head
looks
very
similar
to
a
stout
the
nose
is
malty
which
i
was
expecting
with
some
light
molasses
or
perhaps
honey
scent
light
but
pleasant
i
love
the
taste
of
this
for
4
9
alcohol
this
feels
like
a
very
full
beer
like
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
it
initially
a
very
sweet
malt
taste
and
as
it
goes
down
the
taste
leads
to
some
subtle
hoppy
bitterness
and
ends
with
a
smokey
whiskey
style
taste
love
the
taste
mouthfeel
has
some
good
carbonation
that
perfectly
fits
what
this
is
going
for
definitely
will
get
this
beer
again
overall
4
55
a
very
tasty
schwarzbier
that
hits
you
with
roastedness
from
all
sides
it
could
possibly
have
more
depth
for
a
4
9
abv
brew
this
one
hits
the
mark
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
black
lagers
i
have
ever
had
black
lagers
for
sure
arent
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
solid
and
i
could
drink
think
a
lot
do
this
beer
sets
a
metered
pace
early
and
maintains
it
to
a
successful
but
not
very
adventurous
resolution
in
a
style
as
traditional
as
schwarzbeer
such
a
practiced
but
reverential
hand
is
appreciated
when
it
comes
to
matters
of
concept
as
well
as
execution
neither
apologetic
nor
challenging
this
beer
maintains
a
sweet
spot
of
appeal
that
could
change
a
lot
of
casual
minds
about
darker
styles
overall
if
it
wasnt
for
the
very
bitter
aftertaste
it
would
be
one
quite
tasty
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
roasted
bitter
though
this
may
be
for
you
personal
note
awesome
with
crackers
swiss
cheese
crispy
fried
garlic
and
dijon
overall
this
beer
fits
its
style
well
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
taking
this
beer
for
what
its
worth
makes
it
very
good
overall
this
is
fairly
tasty
but
needs
some
more
flavors
to
break
up
the
toasty
mineral
flavors
appearance
is
dark
no
really
dark
smell
is
very
toasty
mouthfeel
is
heavy
on
the
tongue
this
does
linger
a
while
taste
is
more
like
a
light
porter
the
toasted
malts
are
nicely
balanced
with
the
carmel
and
chocolate
malts
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
we
feel
is
miss
labled
o
black
lager
is
a
solid
schwarz
o
overall
sam
adams
nails
the
style
pretty
handily
smooth
and
roasty
like
youd
expect
from
the
style
and
just
what
youd
be
looking
for
if
you
asked
for
a
schwarzbier
yet
another
4
9
beer
with
a
ton
of
character
overall
this
was
one
i
was
surprised
by
none
of
its
aspects
stands
out
but
a
very
solid
brew
when
all
put
together
overall
decent
malty
flavored
brew
with
a
little
sweetness
nothing
about
this
beer
is
groundbreaking
or
special
worth
a
drink
if
you
want
a
mild
malty
beer
but
other
then
that
i
could
care
less
to
drink
this
beer
o
fairly
good
all
around
nothing
stands
out
too
much
though
overall
not
bad
but
kinda
lackluster
that
weird
flavoring
like
hazelnut
addition
takes
away
a
bit
and
the
lack
of
clean
crisp
fruity
lager
flavors
doesnt
help
either
more
like
a
lighter
porter
medium
bodied
and
a
little
watery
oily
texture
and
smooth
carbonation
overall
good
classic
black
lager
nice
bold
dark
malt
sweetness
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
sam
adams
boston
lager
glass
o
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
a
little
empty
for
me
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorite
regular
beer
from
sam
adams
its
not
earth
shattering
but
its
pretty
good
overall
this
beer
is
decent
nothing
incredibly
special
but
definitely
not
bad
overall
i
feel
this
beer
is
very
deserving
of
praise
black
lagers
are
unique
in
flavor
and
this
one
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
disapates
gradually
in
the
scent
im
picking
up
some
roasted
robust
malts
sweet
carmal
malts
and
some
toffee
the
boldness
relaly
hits
the
taste
buds
im
getting
some
chalky
roasted
malts
and
a
slighty
nutty
flavors
with
a
little
bit
of
bitter
finish
drinks
quite
well
on
a
cold
night
the
texture
could
be
a
little
thicker
though
and
if
it
had
a
few
more
bolder
elements
this
beer
would
be
getting
some
4
5s
and
5s
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
sa
pint
glass
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
smells
are
somewhat
light
some
roasted
and
bread
malts
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
good
much
lighter
than
a
stout
but
a
nice
lighter
flavored
roasted
malt
flavor
overall
this
is
just
ok
it
tastes
like
boston
lager
hops
food
dye
its
not
bad
but
if
your
going
to
make
a
black
lager
give
it
some
character
flavors
are
very
rich
for
a
sa
lager
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
a
light
roasted
malt
background
and
some
earthy
notes
coming
from
the
hops
o
good
for
the
style
and
good
for
me
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
if
you
want
to
impress
a
newby
to
the
beer
world
with
a
nice
dark
beer
this
is
a
good
choice
this
is
a
good
one
could
kick
back
with
this
all
day
long
o
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
brew
that
gives
a
little
extra
on
the
backside
the
bittersour
flavor
is
nice
and
lingers
a
bit
it
has
a
light
and
crisp
taste
that
european
versions
of
this
are
sometimes
missing
the
aroma
isnt
particularly
strong
but
it
is
nice
i
want
more
overall
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
the
hops
need
to
be
more
present
and
there
is
just
something
off
about
the
finish
it
is
so
close
to
being
really
good
d
very
drinkable
pretty
solid
dark
lager
could
have
used
a
bit
more
flavor
but
what
is
there
is
fairly
nice
and
balanced
medium
bodied
but
fuller
than
expected
or
the
style
with
a
good
balance
of
crisp
earthy
hops
and
sweet
malt
notes
slightly
smokey
but
not
burnt
or
overly
roasted
a
nice
dry
bitter
hop
presence
up
front
with
good
puny
flavor
lingers
troughout
and
provides
nice
balance
this
is
followsd
by
the
sweet
slightly
roasted
malt
presence
that
gives
off
hints
of
caramel
toffee
hazelnut
and
toast
not
overly
complex
but
well
balance
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
offerings
ive
tried
o
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
personally
i
would
like
the
flavor
be
a
bit
more
heavy
as
it
warms
the
flavor
does
come
out
more
though
still
mild
overall
a
refreshing
brew
to
have
in
the
cooler
seasons
much
different
than
the
color
this
beer
is
nothing
like
a
stout
this
beer
is
very
light
in
body
and
very
drinkable
it
has
a
very
tasty
light
flavor
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
try
o
overall
a
good
beer
rather
versatile
as
well
it
has
the
taste
to
make
it
more
hardy
but
the
body
to
make
it
just
as
refreshing
overall
a
solid
take
on
the
style
the
dark
malts
are
rich
and
balanced
this
was
a
decent
schwarzbier
not
the
best
ive
had
but
far
from
the
worst
it
could
use
more
complexity
in
the
aroma
and
taste
but
in
general
this
is
acceptable
o
overall
a
nice
dark
lager
there
is
a
nice
roasted
note
with
caramel
flavors
and
is
easy
drinking
and
light
my
favorite
of
the
five
i
tried
in
the
harvest
collection
didnt
count
the
original
samuel
adams
beer
nice
smooth
dark
beer
nothing
particularly
enjoyable
about
this
and
the
overly
roasted
char
notes
are
fairly
unpleasant
o
well
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
id
say
this
is
the
beer
equivalent
of
cola
thats
actually
a
compliment
as
it
still
tastes
like
a
proper
beer
at
the
end
of
the
day
id
definitely
have
it
again
o
i
think
its
a
easy
going
beer
nothing
to
complex
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
sam
adams
fall
pack
will
buy
again
next
fall
overall
its
a
decent
beer
taste
isnt
as
full
as
it
could
be
i
could
see
this
beer
being
better
with
some
tweeking
but
hey
im
no
brewer
not
a
bad
beer
to
toss
in
a
mix
pack
but
i
probably
wont
buy
any
singles
or
6
packs
overall
a
good
beer
i
like
th
ecomplexity
of
flavors
just
wish
the
aroma
was
as
inticing
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
full
of
flavor
skål
the
samuel
adams
black
lager
is
a
solid
dark
lager
the
appearance
as
poured
into
my
pint
glass
was
quite
good
the
color
was
a
dark
nearly
opaque
with
rich
redamber
hue
the
head
was
thin
and
offwhite
some
lacing
the
smell
includes
roast
and
sweet
malt
like
molassis
the
taste
had
an
interesting
mixture
of
roast
malt
caramel
and
hops
the
combination
lent
to
a
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
a
nice
beer
for
the
cooler
nights
overall
another
decent
creation
by
sammy
a
overall
not
terrible
this
is
not
one
ill
be
reaching
for
again
but
it
is
not
entirely
undrinkable
i
had
a
much
longer
review
of
this
beer
but
my
connection
cut
out
on
me
heres
a
smaller
version
of
the
original
pours
dark
brown
black
with
a
red
hue
in
glass
thick
tanned
head
aroma
has
caramel
smoke
and
coffee
medium
malted
body
good
sweetness
some
coffee
notes
comes
through
but
caramel
and
smoke
dominates
feel
is
a
bit
oily
also
some
dry
feel
finish
has
nice
hop
bitterness
d
really
not
a
complex
beer
at
all
but
it
goes
down
easily
enough
its
pretty
well
balanced
between
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
slight
bitterness
and
subtle
sweetness
goes
down
easily
but
is
overall
forgettable
o
a
good
sessionable
beer
o
ok
nothing
special
light
aroma
and
taste
another
beer
to
get
your
friends
to
try
some
darker
beer
o
very
wellrounded
representative
of
the
style
really
kind
of
like
a
winterized
light
lager
the
hops
finish
seems
dumbed
down
just
a
bit
to
retain
mass
appeal
but
a
good
brew
nonetheless
not
a
bad
sessionable
beer
one
of
my
more
favorites
in
the
sam
adams
12
packs
but
im
having
a
hard
time
determining
if
this
really
a
lager
or
not
definatly
not
something
i
would
drink
too
often
kind
of
like
a
weak
brown
ale
overall
based
on
the
smell
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
this
is
actually
a
pretty
solid
schwarzbier
here
very
drinkable
and
sooth
would
be
an
ideal
session
beer
o
the
black
lager
is
an
easy
drinker
and
was
an
enjoyable
good
beer
it
is
a
solid
though
not
shining
example
cheers
pours
out
a
black
hue
with
rubyred
highlights
that
has
nice
lacing
and
retention
dark
fruits
chocolate
toffee
and
some
burnt
roast
gives
it
a
pleasant
nose
i
get
some
chocolate
toffee
followed
by
some
dark
fruits
burnt
roast
taste
in
the
back
with
some
hints
of
caramel
and
citrus
hops
very
yummy
and
well
balanced
with
a
nice
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
has
a
dry
finished
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
sam
adams
yummy
yummy
yummy
dr
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
is
also
bland
the
abv
is
average
as
a
schwarzbier
i
guess
its
a
minute
success
i
wont
be
purchasing
it
again
o
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
its
also
nice
because
its
so
different
worth
checking
out
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
back
in
the
days
before
i
drank
mostly
craft
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
nice
chouffe
goblet
dark
cola
colored
almost
zero
head
no
lacing
on
the
nose
bitter
coffee
lots
of
prominent
malt
some
light
milk
chocolate
not
much
hop
to
speak
of
a
little
bit
of
smoke
on
the
palate
more
of
the
same
sour
and
bitter
coffee
the
smoke
is
more
prevalent
lots
of
malt
but
its
dry
not
sweet
at
all
the
flavor
is
almost
that
of
a
stout
mixed
with
club
soda
which
is
pretty
true
to
style
very
bubbly
good
beer
nothing
stellar
but
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
offerings
o
another
from
the
fall
pack
from
sam
adams
very
middle
of
the
road
beer
just
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
it
is
what
it
is
overall
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
good
as
i
used
to
think
it
was
a
good
beer
if
you
dont
want
to
pay
too
much
attention
to
what
youre
drinking
pleasant
pretty
nice
schwartzbier
glad
they
packed
it
into
their
autumn
sampler
overall
i
think
its
drinkable
but
i
think
id
rather
just
get
a
good
porter
oof
the
the
schwarzbiers
this
one
is
the
best
so
far
gotta
love
sa
for
making
some
of
the
lesser
known
styles
and
making
them
well
to
get
into
the
style
a
solid
black
brown
color
with
a
reasonable
sized
light
creamy
tan
head
and
good
lacing
the
nose
finds
deep
nutty
malt
with
a
hint
of
molasses
decent
and
relatively
simple
the
tongue
detects
lots
more
malt
and
molasses
with
raisin
apricot
hints
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
smooth
well
carbonated
and
easy
drinking
feel
i
get
some
brown
bread
and
a
vague
charcoal
ingredient
its
a
very
serviceable
brew
this
beer
doesnt
amaze
me
but
it
is
solid
and
tasty
the
problem
is
this
beer
is
a
tweener
it
has
just
enough
flavor
to
be
on
the
sweet
side
and
therefore
loses
drinkability
but
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
to
leave
a
lasting
impression
taking
the
good
with
the
bad
this
is
pretty
all
right
i
expect
no
less
from
sam
adams
overall
a
nice
drinking
beer
easily
sessionable
appropriate
any
time
o
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
this
beer
is
fantastic
its
a
stout
in
lager
form
essentially
i
have
never
had
anything
in
this
style
before
so
my
ratings
are
purely
on
a
selfbiased
scale
but
once
i
get
more
from
this
style
ill
be
sure
to
rereview
it
within
its
own
style
damn
that
is
tasty
a
good
lager
for
cooler
weather
o
a
solid
beer
overall
goes
down
easy
and
would
make
a
good
candidate
for
a
drinking
session
one
of
sam
adams
better
beers
imho
first
sip
gives
me
a
lot
of
that
maltiness
its
rich
but
not
heavy
not
thin
bodied
either
but
somewhere
in
between
say
a
porter
and
a
brown
or
amber
ale
i
definitely
get
a
frontloaded
sweetness
that
turns
dry
on
the
end
its
well
carbonated
and
the
carbonation
keeps
it
from
feeling
heavy
in
spite
of
the
malt
body
i
dont
expect
any
hop
profile
but
im
trying
to
pick
up
on
the
bavarian
noble
hops
the
label
identifies
just
for
my
own
edification
id
finish
the
night
with
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
have
two
in
a
row
overall
im
not
one
to
hate
on
sam
adams
far
from
it
the
irish
red
in
this
pack
was
ok
and
the
oktoberfest
rauchbier
and
pumpkin
ale
were
enjoyable
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
though
there
isnt
the
nice
munich
toasty
background
nor
the
roast
intensity
that
make
the
good
german
schwartzbiers
and
this
tastes
more
like
an
ale
with
the
estery
profile
its
not
a
bad
beer
per
se
but
i
dont
see
myself
ever
buying
a
sixer
of
it
unlike
sams
cream
stout
which
is
pretty
tasty
overall
good
beer
with
nice
taste
and
good
drinkability
not
exceptional
but
still
a
good
beer
notes
from
149
a
good
way
to
start
off
the
variety
pack
color
me
imoressed
o
this
is
a
solid
offereing
that
im
proud
to
drink
and
can
handle
quite
a
bit
of
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weisse
vase
the
bee
pours
a
rubyhighlighted
very
dark
brown
with
a
chuny
dense
foamy
biege
head
that
starts
at
a
robust
two
and
a
half
inches
but
eventually
settles
into
a
quarter
inch
aromas
are
rich
and
robust
with
a
heavy
sour
malt
and
toasted
oats
balance
the
beer
has
some
interesting
flavors
with
rich
and
darkly
sweet
malt
profiles
of
chocolate
and
molasses
and
a
bitter
coffee
character
that
balances
along
with
some
roasted
highlights
the
beer
leaves
a
decent
light
lacing
along
the
glass
while
you
drink
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
coffee
with
a
slight
linger
to
the
dryroast
taste
and
the
beer
has
a
tangy
midlingering
finish
decent
beer
o
a
good
dark
lager
if
you
are
in
for
smokey
flavored
beers
something
is
missing
from
it
being
truly
outstanding
but
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
could
easily
become
one
of
my
favorites
a
pretty
good
brew
the
fall
variety
pack
is
pretty
good
this
year
and
this
one
adds
nicely
to
the
selections
the
strange
smell
is
weird
to
me
i
never
smell
something
like
that
so
i
really
cant
describe
the
smell
but
i
am
sure
it
tastes
better
than
smell
somehow
i
think
the
smell
of
this
better
is
horrible
for
taste
there
is
indeed
some
after
taste
of
little
bitterness
and
that
is
it
overall
when
i
see
a
black
beer
i
expect
something
heavier
like
a
stout
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
schwarzbier
before
so
i
dont
have
a
baseline
to
compare
it
too
but
it
was
a
decent
beer
a
little
more
balance
to
the
sweetness
would
have
been
nice
i
really
like
this
style
and
this
is
a
good
representation
complex
and
dark
flavors
yet
still
crisp
and
highly
drinkable
well
done
o
overall
a
good
tasty
lager
close
to
a
lighter
porter
you
could
almost
call
this
a
porter
but
i
know
its
different
but
how
a
little
watery
and
lighter
cocoroast
maybe
came
with
the
harvest
pack
o
another
enjoyable
beer
from
the
bbc
they
may
not
do
anything
remarkably
well
but
they
do
everything
well
enough
clean
and
refreshing
for
something
with
so
much
roasted
malty
goodness
sessionable
for
the
right
tastes
o
very
drinkable
light
but
perfect
for
a
traditional
schwartzbeer
great
black
lager
o
a
decent
schwarzbier
has
the
light
refreshing
qualities
of
a
typical
lager
but
with
a
nice
light
roasty
quality
to
it
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
with
nothing
standing
out
the
saranac
black
forest
i
reviewed
yesterday
was
definitely
a
step
above
this
one
o
very
nice
for
the
style
clean
and
crisp
yet
rich
and
flavorful
one
of
the
better
sam
outings
o
a
good
stab
at
a
schwarzbier
it
could
definitely
be
darker
although
the
malt
level
is
good
where
it
is
overall
though
i
like
where
it
stands
in
terms
of
being
balanced
between
the
malts
and
hops
pours
a
dark
black
color
that
show
red
edges
when
held
up
to
light
small
grayish
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
pleasant
malt
aromas
with
a
bit
of
roasted
chocolate
scents
taste
is
a
bit
spicy
with
some
tasty
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
flavors
very
smooth
roasted
flavors
as
well
a
bit
nutty
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
but
with
deep
dark
characteristics
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
one
tasty
lager
osolid
beer
that
is
not
overpowering
in
any
area
the
sam
adams
black
lager
is
a
rich
a
hearty
beer
the
coloris
a
deep
black
with
crimson
low
lights
and
a
nice
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
rich
chocolate
barley
taste
like
chocolate
and
lightly
smoked
malt
the
finish
is
surprisingly
mild
and
that
makes
it
more
drinkable
that
some
dark
lagers
people
that
are
scared
of
dark
beers
should
give
this
one
a
try
its
much
less
harsh
than
some
out
there
a
nice
combination
of
sweet
and
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
also
some
chocolaty
mocha
hints
a
bit
more
of
a
roast
character
on
the
tongue
but
nice
still
pick
up
on
the
sweetness
especially
in
the
finish
and
as
it
warms
a
smooth
medium
body
with
pleasant
carbonation
finishes
with
clean
hop
bitterness
that
leaves
palate
dry
and
refreshed
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
notes
linger
through
the
end
of
the
finish
easily
my
favorite
out
of
the
fall
pack
thus
far
showcasing
a
solid
take
on
a
rather
rare
beer
style
cheers
o
cheers
to
this
tasty
black
lager
not
a
bad
schwarzbier
drinkable
and
flavorful
sam
adams
actually
puts
together
something
nice
and
true
to
style
here
overall
fairly
decent
and
surprising
tastes
like
a
schwarzbeir
to
me
and
not
too
bad
for
one
either
drinkabilityoverall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
easily
drinkable
and
had
a
good
level
balance
and
though
not
really
highly
complex
i
did
enjoy
it
if
looking
for
a
smokey
roasted
black
lager
this
would
be
worth
a
look
this
bottle
from
current
harvest
collection
freshness
dated
jan
2012
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
from
sam
adams
which
i
have
had
a
few
times
over
the
years
and
always
pretty
good
not
great
onice
thick
dark
beer
i
enjoyed
having
this
in
the
harvest
collection
12
pack
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
flavour
was
well
balanced
and
it
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
with
no
issues
id
buy
it
again
especially
during
the
fall
o
i
like
it
great
fall
or
winter
beer
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
sam
adams
lineup
im
not
sure
why
more
craft
brewers
dont
have
a
go
at
the
style
but
i
would
like
to
see
that
change
one
of
my
favorite
american
schwarzbiers
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
want
to
try
a
dark
beer
but
is
not
ready
for
a
heavy
roasted
coffee
and
big
hoppiness
of
most
stouts
and
porters
final
thoughts
pretty
good
and
of
the
style
if
i
remember
it
correctly
its
worth
the
buy
o
overall
a
nice
schwarzbier
a
style
i
greatly
enjoy
and
a
perfectly
adequate
take
on
it
samuel
adams
has
crafted
a
tasty
black
lager
here
when
the
temps
drop
again
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
more
of
these
m
extremely
smooth
good
carbonation
very
pleasent
on
a
warm
florida
night
overall
a
tasty
and
satisfying
dark
beer
not
too
heavy
but
probably
not
a
beer
you
would
want
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
either
poured
an
opaque
coffee
black
a
nice
two
or
three
fingers
of
foamy
tan
head
that
retains
and
laces
well
good
aroma
of
dark
roasty
malts
chocolate
tones
taste
starts
out
on
the
sweet
side
chocolatey
roasty
brown
sugar
with
a
transition
to
coffee
bitterness
which
comes
out
middrink
some
hoppiness
but
the
malts
are
clearly
in
command
bitter
aftertaste
medium
mouthfeel
and
quite
easily
drinkable
serving
type
bottle
dark
blak
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
creamy
head
aroma
is
cocoa
and
weak
coffee
taste
is
chocolatecoffeesweet
cream
and
a
pinch
of
caramel
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
that
despite
its
dark
color
is
probably
best
suited
for
the
warmer
months
i
would
recommend
and
would
purchase
again
samuel
adams
black
lager
is
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
it
has
a
solid
one
inch
thick
head
with
a
deep
blackamber
color
it
doesnt
feel
as
heavy
as
the
color
would
suggest
the
black
lager
has
a
smooth
finish
with
a
raisin
like
after
taste
the
first
thing
that
i
notice
about
the
flavor
is
mocha
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
prune
juice
at
first
it
may
not
be
very
enjoyable
to
some
but
it
quickly
grows
on
you
i
may
not
buy
it
again
but
i
am
glad
that
i
did
at
least
once
other
than
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
nice
soft
beer
big
mouth
feel
but
the
carbonation
lends
it
a
softness
a
teddy
bear
in
a
glass
pours
a
nice
dark
caramel
color
in
the
light
and
dark
black
color
not
in
direct
light
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
hangs
on
for
a
good
long
time
smells
nice
and
malty
with
some
sweet
and
skunky
notes
very
malty
and
subtle
sweet
flavors
has
that
good
punchy
roasted
taste
to
round
out
for
that
familiar
black
beer
flavor
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
really
finishes
this
one
off
i
am
very
impressed
and
as
usual
samuel
adams
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
really
deep
brown
color
with
a
pretty
strong
head
on
it
the
aromas
of
some
roasted
malts
and
caramel
are
on
the
nose
along
with
some
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
good
bitterness
to
it
theres
a
light
burnt
flavor
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavier
than
i
expected
overall
pretty
good
beer
final
notes
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
very
sessionable
and
pretty
runofthemill
great
introduction
to
the
world
of
dark
beer
for
beginners
very
solid
beer
this
is
a
great
choice
if
you
want
the
feel
and
taste
of
a
traditional
stout
without
the
heavier
body
as
a
black
lager
should
be
becoming
even
more
delightful
as
the
beer
warms
up
to
a
proper
temperature
dark
brown
with
reddish
edges
and
an
off
white
head
that
lasts
weak
aroma
of
cinnamon
prunes
medicinal
notes
maple
tastes
of
maple
cinnamon
prunes
some
hop
presence
toward
the
finish
but
a
lasting
medicinal
tang
takes
over
in
the
aftertaste
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
tangy
with
spice
but
a
lil
too
much
this
is
a
pleasant
dark
lager
i
was
surprised
by
the
burnt
taste
of
the
hops
and
thought
that
it
brought
a
nice
flavor
addition
to
what
would
have
been
a
normal
lager
it
seemed
to
be
a
nice
mix
of
my
two
favorite
beers
stouts
and
lagers
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
miss
it
when
i
finish
the
6
pack
got
this
from
a
bottle
very
dark
pour
with
a
nice
beige
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
slight
malt
aroma
beer
has
a
crisp
chocolatecaramel
taste
with
no
real
noticeable
finish
solid
lager
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
a
while
would
definitely
buy
again
overall
a
nice
refreshing
brew
that
has
an
aftertaste
that
reminded
me
of
a
smooth
porter
it
lack
a
decent
head
and
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
or
i
would
have
reviewed
higher
but
the
taste
was
very
nice
indeed
overall
very
good
reminds
you
of
a
stout
or
porter
but
with
some
differences
i
appreciate
boston
beer
co
producing
an
uncommon
style
like
this
and
doing
a
good
job
with
it
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
it
produced
a
decent
off
white
head
with
above
average
head
retention
very
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
schwarzbier
had
notes
of
burnt
malt
caramel
and
chocolate
it
has
a
nice
medium
body
and
is
malty
and
hints
of
carmel
there
was
also
some
sweetness
that
balanced
this
beer
out
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
schwarzbier
it
is
a
little
sweet
but
it
would
be
a
great
starter
beer
to
give
someone
this
will
work
for
a
warm
spring
or
summer
weekend
back
in
the
day
i
used
to
enjoy
this
one
more
when
it
was
warm
than
cold
but
im
gonna
start
off
on
the
latter
end
of
the
spectrum
this
time
shits
and
giggles
ysee
it
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
slightly
dirty
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
toffee
plenty
o
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
light
coffee
the
taste
doesnt
deviate
too
far
from
this
though
the
cocoa
is
definitely
dominant
here
especially
as
it
warms
making
a
sort
of
light
version
of
a
milk
stout
after
a
while
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
schwarz
one
of
the
best
regulars
sam
adams
puts
out
pours
a
two
finger
tan
creamy
head
mostly
black
filtered
clear
body
smells
yeasty
sweet
some
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
tastes
sweet
and
toffee
coffee
roasty
malts
some
earthy
hops
mediumthin
body
medium
carbonation
some
lingering
hop
and
roasty
bitterness
overall
this
doesnt
sit
too
well
for
me
the
roastedsweetthin
body
combination
doesnt
work
well
this
needs
more
body
and
carmel
malts
for
me
i
barely
finished
the
bottle
8
50
a
sixer
oh
well
itll
sit
around
for
some
friends
to
try
not
sure
if
i
would
put
this
in
the
brewmasters
collection
sixes
as
sam
has
a
lot
more
to
offer
than
this
overall
not
bad
but
by
no
means
great
either
overall
my
senses
and
consciousness
are
conflicted
with
complexity
versus
simplicity
this
beer
produced
mixed
results
for
me
it
looked
and
smelled
great
of
chocolate
and
caramel
however
i
tasted
it
and
found
that
it
lacked
some
flavor
and
ended
being
slightly
thinner
than
expected
im
not
entirely
let
down
though
and
i
would
buy
it
though
i
hope
that
it
could
be
improved
one
of
my
two
favorite
black
beers
the
other
being
the
retired
orilo
organic
black
lager
one
of
the
top
five
beers
from
sam
adams
nicely
done
overall
i
am
pretty
impressed
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
schwarzbier
and
i
can
foresee
it
being
utilized
in
many
food
pairings
o
this
was
one
of
my
first
schwarzbiers
but
i
found
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
still
do
this
is
not
something
to
recommend
to
anybody
without
wasting
their
money
poured
black
in
color
with
a
small
light
brown
head
that
dissapated
in
seconds
with
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
light
with
a
hint
of
roasted
coffee
malts
and
a
light
doughy
yeast
scent
it
tasted
of
burnt
coffee
slightly
sweet
with
a
bitter
finish
that
stayed
with
you
for
a
while
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
but
quite
creamy
overall
qiute

nice

not

black
colour
rather
very
dark
brown
thick
beige
head
moderate
but
nice
aroma
of
dark
bread
roasted
malts
and
herbal
german
hops
the
flavour
is
moderately
roasty
with
just
a
modest
sweetness
could
be
called
medium
dry
a
slight
acidity
in
the
finish
more
bittering
hops
would
be
desirable
decent
enough
to
drink
but
not
very
exciting
d
easy
to
drink
but
from
what
i
have
read
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
lightbodied
and
more
than
drinkable
id
compare
this
one
to
a
light
stout
maybe
a
tasty
sessioner
here
more
malty
than
hops
good
color
an
feel
easy
to
drink
several
on
a
hot
summer
day
much
better
than
the
macro
breweries
offers
rjt
d
i
think
this
is
the
typical
us
take
on
the
black
lager
style
sort
of
a
light
low
gravity
understated
baltic
porter
mostly
just
in
flavoraroma
profile
it
does
not
have
the
heft
bulk
of
a
real
porter
flavorful
refreshing
d
very
drinkable
i
like
this
one
verdict
still
a
solid
beer
by
my
count
the
faith
i
placed
in
sam
adams
black
lager
as
a
beer
newbie
seems
to
have
been
well
placed
its
nicely
roasty
deep
enough
to
hold
your
attention
and
easily
quaffable
low
carbonation
but
a
mediumheavy
body
goes
down
smooth
and
quickly
in
closing
this
is
a
nice
introduction
to
dark
lagers
and
is
worth
picking
up
on
your
next
beer
run
notes
i
have
never
had
a
bad
sam
adams
brew
and
the
black
lager
is
no
exception
i
have
read
that
black
lager
is
typically
light
in
character
so
perhaps
the
flavor
is
true
to
the
style
for
me
after
tasting
i
would
pass
this
one
up
for
another
style
drinkability
this
ale
went
down
nice
but
could
use
a
little
bitterness
from
the
hops
or
the
roasted
malt
or
barley
despite
its
flaws
black
lager
is
drinkable
beer
for
those
people
who
want
the
that
roasted
malt
flavor
without
drinking
stout
or
porter
pours
a
nice
two
finger
head
very
pillowy
and
creamy
looking
smell
is
very
malty
i
might
detect
hints
of
chocolate
notes
but
it
is
very
distant
in
the
taste
you
get
a
lot
of
malts
in
the
back
end
you
get
a
slight
taste
of
coffee
which
is
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
plain
it
almost
feels
like
im
drinking
carbonated
water
this
beer
feels
a
little
too
carbonated
for
the
style
the
flavor
would
taste
like
im
drinking
carbonated
water
as
well
except
for
the
malts
and
other
notes
i
get
very
average
beer
both
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
its
crisp
and
fairly
refreshing
for
the
darker
flavors
presented
here
again
it
reminds
me
of
boston
lager
in
some
strange
way
this
is
almost
a
porterized
version
of
boston
lager
roast
the
malts
and
throw
in
some
coffee
and
chocolate
and
there
you
go
sam
adams
black
lager
sam
adams
black
lager
is
my
first
venture
into
the
schwarz
bier
style
i
enjoyed
it
much
like
a
light
porter
black
lager
is
a
nice
alternative
brew
to
porters
and
stouts
for
the
late
fall
and
winter
months
picked
up
in
a
mix
six
pack
hope
this
turns
out
better
than
the
other
two
poured
a
nice
black
ruby
color
with
decent
head
that
was
a
creamy
thick
off
white
color
smell
was
toasted
and
caramel
malts
maybe
a
bit
of
roast
taste
is
muted
chocolate
bit
of
roasted
grain
and
dominated
by
caramel
malt
descent
mouthfeel
creamy
and
smooth
could
be
a
little
bit
smoother
drinkability
is
nice
good
refreshing
beer
i
picked
this
one
up
in
a
mixed
sixie
last
week
and
i
actually
had
some
pretty
decently
high
hopes
for
it
sadly
it
let
me
down
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
lightly
roasted
malt
decent
quality
chocolate
and
some
coffee
on
the
nose
light
bodied
with
lightly
roasted
malt
generic
chocolate
and
coffee
this
was
a
decent
choice
in
brews
that
i
got
in
the
variety
pack
from
sam
adams
pours
a
nice
dark
color
with
a
little
foamy
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
not
much
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
didnt
really
care
for
the
taste
as
much
as
other
black
lagers
ive
had
it
just
seemed
a
bit
dumbed
down
from
where
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
if
youre
looking
for
an
intense
flavor
this
one
isnt
your
beer
but
it
does
have
a
nice
flavor
considering
the
style
the
taste
is
smooth
no
harsh
carbonation
at
all
the
carbonation
is
light
and
buttery
on
the
tongue
much
like
a
well
poured
nitro
stout
the
flavor
is
light
roasted
barley
starts
with
a
sweet
malt
the
roasted
flavor
remains
throughout
and
finishes
with
a
coffee
bitterness
and
is
dry
at
the
end
md
light
to
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
would
have
liked
a
little
creamier
its
fine
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
decent
enough
beer
is
thin
with
a
mild
roastiness
at
the
back
end
of
the
palate
otherwise
its
a
plain
jane
beer
i
just
dont
get
much
from
it
it
is
unoffensive
just
not
very
interesting
im
going
by
memory
on
this
one
but
i
remember
it
pretty
well
it
looked
like
a
porter
and
smelled
of
one
too
the
only
thing
that
separated
this
and
a
porter
was
that
this
had
a
thinner
mouthfeel
and
wasnt
as
thick
in
body
and
flavor
its
like
in
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
porter
really
very
nice
almost
coffee
like
roasted
malt
smell
and
taste
it
ends
with
a
tiny
bit
of
noble
hops
to
match
up
with
the
subtle
bitterness
coming
from
the
roasted
dark
coffee
like
malt
its
a
very
smooth
beer
that
goes
down
too
easily
if
you
want
a
dark
beer
that
you
can
actually
have
a
session
with
this
is
your
beer
most
definitely
d
on
the
creamy
and
roasted
side
but
slightly
watery
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
sam
adams
selection
what
a
well
balanced
schwarzbier
with
sufficient
complexity
to
make
it
one
of
the
most
worthy
of
the
style
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
schwarzbier
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
cold
winter
months
this
is
a
must
try
d
not
a
bad
quaff
but
again
and
as
with
many
of
bbcs
beers
ill
save
any
purchases
for
a
desperate
situation
and
probably
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
it
at
that
time
d
goes
down
easily
not
too
fizzy
helps
here
more
than
it
hurts
the
mouthfeel
tasty
with
character
but
never
heavy
totally
sessionable
if
youre
into
the
style
d
very
drinkable
reminds
me
a
little
of
some
noncomplex

flavors
begin
with
sweet
roasted

chocolate
and
some
earthy
hops
while
finish
is
dry
with
coffee
notes
quite
tasty
beer
from
sa
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
i
get
some
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
a
nuttyness
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
but
i
also
get
a
little
burnt
character
as
well
as
some
cream
notes
the
beer
is
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
but
there
is
a
nice
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
burnt
malt
at
the
end
medium
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
enjoyable
definitely
one
of
the
better
black
lager
beers
ive
had
in
some
time
sam
adams
almost
always
produces
a
great
beer
this
beer
is
smoooth
not
a
high
abv
for
a
darker
beer
the
perfect
amont
of
head
a
sweet
aroma
and
leaves
a
nice
taste
on
your
tongue
but
not
a
bitter
aftertaste
id
definitely
recommend
it
and
will
check
it
out
again
at
a
later
date
almost

is
a
40
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
cant
get
any
darker
than
that
although
with
a
strong
light
shining
through
the
brew
it
is
actually
a
very
dark
reddish
brown
smells
of
a
hint
of
caramel
coffee
chocolate
sweet
burnt
malt
and
roasted
wheat
flavor
is
bold
but
not
overpowering
sort
of
a
sweet
coffee
taste
with
caramel
and
chocolate
the
malt
flavor
seems
to
have
some
cinnamon
hints
a
little
wimpy
in
my
mouth
some
sense
of
fullness
but
just
not
quite
the
zip
i
was
hoping
to
feel
the
flavor
grows
on
me
as
i
work
the
level
in
my
glass
south
might
have
to
have
another
to
fully
appreciate
the
flavors
this
was
a
bit
of
a
treat
nice
and
pleasant
d
another
beer
that
i
could
easily
sit
back
and
enjoy
a
six
pack
off
quite
drinkable
pours

very
dark
brown
slightly
translucent

nice

around
smell
is
nicely
toasted
mocha
more
sugary
sweet

bitter
a
surprising
burst
of
citrusy
hops
starts
the
taste
and
compliments
the
coffeish
malts
nicely
complex
finishes
bitter
and
nutty
very
tasty
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
this
brew
is
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
faves
from
sam
adams
drinkability
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
brews
nor
is
it
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
a
beer
i
can
finish
but
would
probably
not
go
for
round
two
every
time
i
took
a
drink
i
continually
got
the
buttermilk
scent
i
didnt
care
for
that
others
may
enjoy
this
beer
however
i
dont
think
i
will
try
this
again
happy
thanksgiving
everybody
d
a
good
one
from
sam
cant
say
its
fantastic
but
its
a
good
sessionable
brew
d
im
actually
very
impressed
by
this
offering
from
sam
adams
i
didnt
expect
this
to
impress
me
as
it
has
excellent
flavor
combined
with
a
low
abv
makes
this
a
very
sessionable
beer
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
to
any
of
my
friends
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
nice
lasting
tan
head
aroma
of
malts
caramel
hops
taste
is

caramel
some

palate
some
good
carboantion
nice
medium
to
full
body
smooth
beer
finish
is
malty
caramel
this
a
very
flavorfull
beer
would
drink
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
i
tried
this
one
a
while
back
and
found
it
undesirable
now
that
my
taste
is
more
refined
i
find
it
well
somewhat
tolerable
its
look
is
peculiar
with
the
side
edges
of
my
perfect
pour
glass
red
and
the
bottom
edge
brown
theres
a
thick
finger
of
foam
that
lasts
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
is
very
feint
just
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
mild
malty
but
turns
slightly
sour
at
the
end
that
throws
of
my
taste
buds
i
didnt
bother
to
finish
the
glass
because
it
just
wasnt
that
enjoyable
ill
probably
give
away
my
other
bottle
d
overall
very
meh
i
liked
it
but
some
much
of
the
roasted
flavors
reminded
me
too
much
of
barbequed
vegetables
and
corn
the
only
other
beer
of
this
style
xingu
was
much
better
spot
on
the
style
and
one
i
really
enjoy
hops
waft
from
this
opaque
black
coloured
elixir
with
generous
light
brown
head
that
leads
a
mastery
of
spider
lacing
more
roast
in
aroma
and
taste
as
the
beer
settles
very
drinkable
enjoyed
in
the
samuel
adams
glass
middling
mouthfeel
suitable
carbonation
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
they
both
disappear
way
to
quickly
its
as
if
my
mouth
absorbs
it
all
and
there
is
nothing
left
to
swallow
this
beer
has
potential
but
i
would
like
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
to
last
longer
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
but
has
an
amber
hue
to
it
the
head
is
a
frothy
white
and
seemed
to
last
for
awhile
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
of
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
of
burnt
roasted
malts
hint
of
coffee
there
is
a
well
balanced
hop
flavor
with
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
i
would
say
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
poured
a
nice
deep
blackdeep
garnet
with
hues
of
such
in
the
light
a
modest
off
white
head
that
didnt
lace
much
and
diminished
quickly
into
a
bubbly
ring
light
fruitiness
touch
of
metallic
and
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
toast
and
toffee
i
guess
the
best
way
to
describe
all
of
this
is
delicate
the
taste
is
a
touch
more
assertive
which
i
enjoy
it
has
more
of
a
chocolatecarob
character
to
it
and
caramel
nicely
supports
it
as
well
raisins
come
out
in
the
finish
adorned
by
a
slightest
touch
of
coffee
beans
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
slick
and
light
with
a
nicely
executed
carbonation
very
smooth
indeed
i
was
gonna
give
it
a
3
but
that
carbonation
is
just
spot
on
perfect
imo
a
good
drinkable
beer
nothing
outstanding
or
holy
crap
this
is
awesome
but
not
a
yuck
beer
either
something
to
grab
at
the
end
of
a
warm
day
in
the
middle
of
cooking
up
a
steak
or
a
burger
notes
a
fairly
solid
attempt
at
a
swarzbier
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
could
be
taken
up
just
a
notch
mouthfeel
ws
a
bit
too
thick
for
the
style
as
well
still
a
good
beer
i
wish
more
american
brewers
would
brew
schwarzbiers
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
could
drink
a
few
in
a
sitting
pours
a
semitranslucent
dark
brown
color
with
2finger
off
white
head
that
left
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
that
of
dark
roasted
malts
there
isnt
really
any
hop
presence
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
dominated
by
dark
malts
there
is
a
little
hop
presence
at
the
finish
but
not
much
there
are
also
some
slight
notes
of
chocolate
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
and
has
medium
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
it
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
drinkability
decent
beer
that
ive
enjoyed
since
sam
adams
started
releasing
it
a
few
years
ago
not
their
best
but
not
their
worst

anything
really
it
is
different
than
a
porter
or
stout
thats
for
sure
lots
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
coffee
and
caramel
flavors
compliment
the
big
malty
flavors
very
well
very
smooth
and
creamy
which
gives
a
nice
contrast
to
the
roasted
malts
and
coffee
flavors
a
little
sweeter
than
some
schwarzbiers
that
i
have
had
before
but
not
overpoweringly
sweet
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
with
no
one
of
them
being
huge
or
overdone
the
hop
presence
is
noticable
but
not
one
of
the
key
flavors
in
the
beer
just
a
slight
floral
presence
resting
in
the
background
medium
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
with
an
almost
silky
feeling
on
the
tongue
easy
to
drink
the
beer
went
down
pretty
easily
and
quickly
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
typically
i
drink
a
stronger
beer
2x3x
the
abv
but
sometimes
i
cant
make
as
much
of
a
commitment
to
sucking
down
ethanol
the
harvest
collection
wasnt
too
bad
but
i
still
see
myself
spending
the
money
differently
in
the
future
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
abv
is
well
hidden
overall
the
only
downfall
is
that
the
aroma
is
a
little
muted
overall
a
good
drinking
beer
by
sam
adams
overall
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
maybe
i
dont
like
the
style
but
this
was
just
unpleasant
at
times
to
drink
because
of
the
dryness
worth
a
drink
if
you
get
the
variety
pack
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
off
light
brown
head
of
3
on
top
of
a
nice
dark
black
body
i
smell
a
a
hint
of
chocolate
it
has
a
great
taste
of
chocolate
and
dark
nuts
and
hops
also
taste
as
beer
warms
up
is
a
little
berry
and
hops
it
is
not
as
heavy
as
i
thought
and
i
think
that
makes
it
have
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
is
drinkable
im
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
but
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
its
enjoyable
at
all
temperatures
as
the
transition
seems
to
make
certain
characteristics
stick
out
more
than
others
all
while
retaining
good
balance
i
expect
quality
beers
from
the
folks
at
sam
adams
and
this
beer
doesnt
disappoint
i
would
have
to
compare
it
to
other
black
lagersschwarzbeirs
for
a
more
accurate
intrastyle
comparison
but
i
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
regardless
of
the
outcome
i
was
not
enamored
with
this
beer
it
pours
great
looks
great
in
the
glass
so
i
was
expecting
big
things
however
for
me
something
is
missing
it
had
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
slight
aftertaste
that
just
didnt
appeal
to
my
taste
buds
i
could
probably
have
a
couple
and
maybe
with
a
good
heavy
meal
it
might
pair
well
however
unless
it
was
free
or
the
only
thing
available
i
couldnt
see
myself
having
a
session
with
this
offering
d
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
would
drink
it
again
d
the
smell
seemed
to
die
off
as
i
drank
the
glass
so
it
was
not
as
offputting
as
the
first
few
drinks
were
the
carbonation
was
annoying
too
still
i
liked
the
taste
pours
a
deep
amber
to
a
black
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
light
roasty
coffee
yet
still
lager
like
in
the
taste
hints
of
coffee
dry
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
a
small
bite
with
a
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
coffee
and
light
caramel
stickiness
in
the
aftertaste
still
quite
lagerish
ok
but
nothing
too
exciting
pretty
nice
little
schwarzbier
youve
got
here
boston
beer
co
a
fine
example
of
the
style
this
is
likely
the
highlight
of
the
brewmasters
collection
sixpack
that
i
bought
onsale
other
beers
are
the
irish
red
and
the
coastal
wheat
d
very
enjoyable
fall
beer
and
very
balanced
overall
would
definitely
like
to
get
more
in
the
future
d
well
i
have
a
couple
more
but
it
was
nice
to
succession
a
couple
of
these
back
to
back
would
not
be
off
putting
to
have
again
in
a
variety
pack
again
i
got
the
black
lager
in
the
sam
adams
harvest
collection
and
it
was
one
of
the
ones
i
liked
the
most
i
enjoyed
the
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
in
it
and
i
will
probably
pick
up
a
6
pack
of
i
see
it
part
of
the
harvest
collection
twelve
pack
poured
into
a
stemmed
beer
glass
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smell
was
very
off
putting
had
a
buttery
sour
smell
to
it
almost
like
a
hint
of
sulfur
not
a
fan
of
the
aroma
the
beer
did
not
taste
bad
though
nice
roasted
coffee
flavors
with
just
a
slight
amount
of
bittersweet
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
just
thick
enough
so
that
it
felt
like
it
had
a
good
body
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
the
smell
was
disappointing
but
i
know
ive
had
this
beer
in
the
past
in
six
packs
and
liked
it
so
id
probably
buy
it
again
sometime
in
the
future
i
was
given
this
beer
when
visiting
a
buddy
of
mine
it
pours
a
very
dark
color
but
my
assumption
of
a
black
lager
was
black
and
i
can
sure
as
heck
see
some
red
in
here
the
aroma
was
a
lot
fainter
that
i
would
have
anticipated
there
are
the
smells
of
a
dark
roasted
coffee
as
well
as
some
chocolate
notes
the
taste
has
similar
notes
to
the
smell
and
it
is
just
as
mild
i
for
some
reason
seem
to
taste
a
bit
of
corn
syrup
in
the
taste
though
it
may
be
due
to
the
caramel
roast
being
as
weak
as
it
is
it
is
not
bitter
at
all
as
i
would
have
expected
and
it
seem
to
go
down
very
easily
a
nice
light
black
lager
if
i
do
say
so
drinkability
not
too
shabby
but
the
style
itself
is
a
bit
plain
to
warrant
too
much
excitement
fro
me
not
heavy
at
all
and
a
lower
abv
certainly
wouldnt
prohibit
this
from
being
used
as
a
session
beer
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
likely
wouldnt
say
oh
hey
look
sa
black
lager
im
gonna
get
me
some
d
nice
fall
session
beer
goes
well
with
the
harvest
mix
pack
it
comes
it
d
i
probably
would
not
pick
this
up
again
its
not
bad
but
just
not
my
kind
of
beer
poured
into
my
sam
adams
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
with
tancreamy
head
aroma
was
of
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
great
chocolate
and
toasted
caramel
malt
flavor
very
creamy
smooth
mouth
feel
medium
body
and
pleasant
to
the
palate
hops
were
there
at
the
finish
for
a
nice
crisp
clean
ending
but
still
a
nice
malty
aftertaste
that
left
me
wanting
more
not
a
typical
german
schwarzbier
but
americanized
wonderfully
i
havent
bought
this
in
yrs
i
cant
believe
i
didnt
rate
this
yet
but
my
neighbor
dont
like
it
so
he
gave
it
to
me
thanx
neighbor
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
darker
beer
but
it
also
has
nothing
much
in
common
with
dark
beers
except
the
color
im
not
huge
on
this
one
d
very
drinkable
beer
this
particular
bottle
came
out
of
the
harvest
pack
but
i
would
pick
this
up
as
a
stand
alone
sixer
for
sure
drinkability
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
glass
it
was
getting
a
little
tough
to
finish
having
one
would
be
good
from
time
to
time
but
i
couldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
thick
offwhite
head
and
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
some
mild
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavour
has
a
nice
bitterness
and
caramel
sweetness
with
some
of
the
roast
coming
through
medium
body
fairly
smooth
quite
a
nice
black
lager
i
havent
had
any
other
schwarzbiers
before
but
i
really
enjoy
this
dlight
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
just
boozy
enough
to
relax
and
enjoy
d
very
drinkable
as
are
most
samuel
adams
beers
i
think
they
are
going
for
the
buy
a
6
pack
or
case
and
sit
down
and
enjoy
it
finish
to
their
beers
i
really
love
to
have
these
at
relatively
normal
parties
that
way
not
to
many
people
ask
for
one
of
your
beers
but
the
ones
that
do
you
know
will
enjoy
it
drinkability
good
brew
and
easy
to
drink
and
appreciate
complex
enough
to
enjoy
good
tasting
and
more
toward
the
lighter
side
less
filling
well
its
not
black
but
its
pretty
close
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
its
pretty
good
looking
poured
in
the
recommended
flute
well
not
quite
a
flute
but
a
tall
skinny
ommegang
glass
its
practically
scentless
taste
is
definitely
more
lageresque
than
i
expected
there
really
isnt
any
roasty
toastiness
from
the
malts
in
this
one
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
light
bodied
pretty
drinkable
actually
but
its
so
ambiguous
i
dont
know
what
to
think
not
sure
if
the
tastelook
mismatch
is
in
my
head
or
if
ive
been
drinking
too
many
stouts
but
i
cant
get
around
the
fact
this
one
doesnt
look
like
it
tastes
it
certainly
isnt
bad
so
i
cant
fault
it
for
that
a
great
beer
enough
going
on
to
keep
people
interested
and
good
flavour
a
great
choice
if
you
want
stout
or
porter
flavors
without
a
heavyfeeling
beer
at
only
4
9
this
is
light
but
not
too
light
with
nice
flavors
it
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
session
a
beer
like
this
too
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
overall
i
rarely
find
myself
impressed
with
samuel
adams
brews
but
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
latitude
48
as
my
favorite
beers
from
them
a
well
balanced
schwarzbier
pours
a
black
color
with
a
tan
head
nice
retention
no
real
lacing
smells
of
decent
malts
and
some
hops
tastes
really
smooth
with
some
nice
tasty
malts
a
bit
boozy
may
have
a
bad
batch
mouthfeel
medium
but
pretty
nice
overall
a
fairly
bad
beer
nice
take
on
the
schwarzbier
style
with
enough
dark
malt
to
add
some
real
complexity
to
the
finish
i
found
it
pretty
drinkable
though
i
was
glad
it
was
part
of
a
mixed
case
as
the
sweetness
gets
to
stick
to
your
palate
sam
adams
usually
does
a
good
job
of
creating
solid
offerings
d
not
a
bad
beer
just
missing
a
little
control
and
refinement
this
style
continues
to
blow
my
mind
with
its
bold
flavors
and
light
body
a
good
welcome
changeup
in
the
sa
mixers
drinkability
is
exceptional
it
is
not
often
i
find
a
beer
i
want
to
quaff
massive
quantities
of
sweet
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
these
12
ounces
as
the
stickiness
and
coating
may
begin
to
bother
me
i
think
ill
need
a
glass
of
water
after
consuming
this
beer
i
am
glad
that
there
is
a
second
bottle
in
the
mix
pack
because
i
will
want
to
revisit
this
beer
soon
it
has
also
inspired
me
to
seek
out
more
beers
of
this
style
as
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
potential
for
some
great
black
lagers
12oz
bottle
poured
into
river
horse
pint
glass
for
lunch
poured
a
dark
redish
brown
color
with
small
head
to
me
it
has
a
strong
barley
smell
and
taste
i
love
dark
beers
but
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
can
drink
it
but
i
choose
not
to
maybe
i
need
a
little
more
black
lager
experience
the
beer
comes
on
a
little
light
on
the
front
end
but
grows
as
you
hold
on
to
it
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
hit
the
back
of
the
palate
however
the
carbonation
keeps
it
from
getting
to
heavy
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
unique
to
the
sam
adams
family
black
lager
poured
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
very
little
head
it
smells
rich
with
hints
of
walnut
or
hazelnut
the
taste
is
strong
choclate
flavors
pretty
malty
as
well
strong
flavor
and
good
carbination
as
well
a
bit
harder
to
drink
because
of
the
heavy
flavors
overall
a
really
good
beer
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
i
guess
my
only
concern
is
that
something
seems
to
be
missing
in
this
beer
almost
like
they
stopped
on
the
flavor
because
of
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
which
is
very
good
d
its
not
very
difficult
to
finish
this
beer
very
quickly
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
quite
sessionable
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
i
like
the
flavors
it
presents
and
that
it
does
so
in
a
restrained
drinkable
way
i
believe
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
style
pretty
solid
beer

flavor

brew

an
average

tastes

slight

overall
good
appearance
body

aroma
d
moderately
drinkable
especially
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
dark
but
not
as
filling
as
a
porter
or
stout
d
really
drinkable
its
got
the
taste
qualities
of
a
stout
without
the
thick
body
really
interesting
style
and
i
want
more
d
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
sweet
and
tasty
beer
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
sa
lineup
pours
a
very
dark
brownbarely
black
body
with
one
finger
of
tan
foam
aromas
are
good
but
a
bit
subdued
primary
aroma
is
roastiness
with
a
light
smokiness
and
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
is
a
bit
strange
in
that
it
initially
strikes
me
on
the
front
palate
as
a
rather
character
deficient
generic
british
pub
ale
before
a
complex
set
of
roasty
espressoish
extremely
dark
chocolatey
notes
suddenly
sprout
out
the
flavor
intensity
is
mellow
the
finish
lingers
briefly
on
a
coffee
note
like
most
sam
adams
the
body
could
hardly
be
better
not
my
favorite
schwarziber
but
hardly
the
worst
its
a
beer
i
welcome
in
one
of
samuel
adams
mixed
cases
but
wouldnt
buy
as
a
six
pack
of
its
own
surprisingly
tasty
pours
a
deep
brown
color
when
held
to
light
i
get
some
nice
reddish
hues
head
is
offwhite
and
pretty
tall
retention
is
good
smell
reminds
me
of
shiner
bock
it
is
roasty
and
carameley
taste
is
of
chocolate
slight
roasty
flavor
no
major
hop
presence
body
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
with
appropriate
carbonation
i
love
that
this
beer
has
a
nice
low
abv
and
a
decent
flavor
it
wound
make
an
okay
session
beer
before
i
knew
it
my
glass
was
down
to
nothing
this
is
quite
the
drinkable
brew
definitely
a
pleasant
experience
for
my
first
schwarzbier
different
distinct
and
wholly
pleasing
the
brewers
at
samuel
adams
continue
to
impress
and
do
the
american
beer
industry
proud
drinkability
big
flavorful
perfect
with
smoked
meat
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
those
weary
of
going
with
a
rauch
or
smoked
beer
this
also
works
as
a
great
marinating
beer
as
well
overall
its
pretty
good
but
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
style
still
a
good
version
compared
to
the
few
that
ive
had
the
smoke
is
light
enough
that
i
can
enjoy
the
beer
overall
a
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
dark
beer
well
done
dfor
some
reason
although
this
beer
initially
tastes
good
it
is
not
very
drinkable
the
main
complaint
i
have
is
that
the
mouth
feel
seems
to
diminish
it
seems
to
become
undesirably
creamy
and
increasingly
bitter
the
great
aftertaste
however
does
stay
i
really
like
this
one
it
has
a
lot
of
dark
roasty
flavors
with
a
light
enough
body
to
stay
highly
drinkable
ill
be
going
back
to
this
one
this
may
be
the
best
offering
from
boston
beer
company
black
lager
is
very
good
and
was
a
nice
surprise
good
stuff
overall
roast
level
lower
than
expected
but
not
out
of
style
well
balanced
easy
drinking
i
would
happily
drink
this
anytime
got
this
one
in
a
sam
adams
fall
mixed
12
pack
a
tasty
roasted
malty
brew
it
is
a
lager
so
its
not
too
heavy
like
some
stouts
and
porters
seems
just
right
to
me
sam
adams
makes
some
quality
beers
and
this
one
has
always
been
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
there
is
significant
room
for
improvement
light
bodied
and
a
bit
a
bit
watery
but
definitely
drinkable
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
something
you
would
consider
sessioning
d
4
maybe
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
the
look
and
feel
are
first
rate
that
alone
manages
to
make
this
one
pretty
drinkable
good
drinkability
relatively
so
there
is
enough
bitterness
to
offset
the
sweetness
which
lends
itself
to
be
a
damn
drinkable
beer
i
could
imagine
myself
enjoying
some
of
these
on
a
cold
fall
day
sitting
in
the
sun
on
my
porch
back
home
in
illinois
a
great
addition
to
the
sa
harvest
pack
d
a
rare
dark
beer
that
boarders
on
the
sessionable
another
style
well
executed
by
the
boys
at
boston
beer
company
very
deep
rubyish
brown
in
color
with
tan
head
good
head
retention
with
nice
lacing
throughout
very
light
aroma
of
slightly
roasted
malt
bread
caramel
good
malty
flavor
more
bread
and
a
touch
of
caramel
with
a
nice
balance
of
floral
hops
medium
body
but
with
a
light
airy
mouthfeel
dnot
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
id
rather
have
this
in
some
of
the
sampler
packs
than
some
of
the
beers
that
make
it
in
i
have
had
much
better
schwarzbiers
though
notes
best
before
nov
2010
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
lot
of
the
typical
dark
roasted
type
of
flavors
but
with
less
of
the
bitterness
that
comes
with
that
enjoyable
to
drink
beer
although
it
wont
blow
you
away
it
is
a
solid
offering
d
certainly
easy
to
drink
and
not
a
style
one
sees
too
often
i
think
i
prefer
kostritzer
but
im
okay
with
this
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
for
me
it
was
a
bit
too
thin
pours
a
very
dark
but
not
opaque
black
brown
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
and
nice
retention
best
appearance
out
of
the
series
so
far
the
aroma
is
burnt
chocolate
coffee
and
some
roasted
nits
the
flavor
is
very
roasty
with
nice
background
malts
creamy
finish
and
medium
bodied
bordering
on
a
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
really
easy
to
drink
has
too
much
carbonation
for
me
for
this
style
bit
its
drinkable
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
as
its
got
a
once
low
abv
and
really
has
a
good
flavor
for
such
a
light
beer
highly
recommended
really
d
very
drinkable
i
remember
having
this
one
from
sam
adams
awhile
ago
and
it
still
doesnt
fail
me
one
of
the
best
sam
offerings
to
me
i
could
quaff
a
sixer
of
this
one
for
sure
and
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
great
price
for
a
good
brew
cheers
d
nice
drinkable
black
lager
23
would
be
my
max
overall
a
pretty
tasty
dark
lager
definitely
sits
heavy
in
the
stomach
but
the
taste
is
worth
it
this
is
fairly
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
though
the
smokiness
of
the
beer
might
limit
how
many
i
would
want
to
drink
d
could
down
three
or
four
in
quick
order
the
sam
adams
black
lager
pours
a
dark
molasseslike
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
small
offwhite
froth
that
dissipates
quickly
on
the
nose
are
aromas
of
bbq
smoke
ground
coffee
beans
dark
chocolate
roasted
hazelnuts
that
follow
through
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
light
bodied
crisp
smooth
full
of
flavor
with
a
pretty
aggressive
carbonation
kind
of
like
coke
the
lingering
flavors
on
the
lasting
finish
leaves
me
with
an
overall
good
impression
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
i
could
easily
see
myself
grabbing
a
sixer
of
this
for
my
next
bbq
even
though
i
wish
the
carbonation
was
less
aggressive
the
head
retained
a
little
longer
the
mouthfeel
was
creamier
i
sill
recommend
this
beer
black
colored
brew
the
lower
half
shines
amber
when
held
to
the
light
small
khaki
colored
head
pretty
good
lacing
chocalte
lagered
malt
scent
pretty
big
chocolate
malt
taste
a
fair
amount
of
roast
almost
creamy
mouth
but
also
fairly
wet
not
a
bad
beer
overall
dm
very
clean
and
not
too
heavy
not
overly
carbonated
very
good
balanced
flavor
drinkability
easy
drinker
and
good
session
beer
but
id
choose
others
over
this
done
of
sam
adams
better
beers
this
is
an
easy
drinker
yet
with
a
full
flavour
a
very
good
american
swartzbier
notes
i
sincerely
like
this
offering
in
the
brewmasters
collection
from
sam
adams
bravo
a
nice
dark
lager
sweet
but
not
too
easy
to
drink
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
grows
on
you
its
a
quenching
dark
brew
which
is
a
juxtaposition
i
love
i
actually
remember
this
brew
being
a
little
bigger
and
not
as
watery
but
thats
not
necessarily
bad
because
i
believe
most
schwarzbiers
are
usually
on
the
thin
side
typically
have
lower
abv
regardless
still
a
good
fallback
on
a
style
i
love
this
is
a
creamy
and
smooth
treat
the
beer
tastes
of
smoke
chocolate
with
an
herbal
finish
this
is
a
great
schwarzbier
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
i
was
looking
all
over
for
it
and
was
finally
able
to
find
it
through
a
friend
very
satisfying
for
a
lager
and
like
i
said
before
its
a
beer
that
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
all
night
balanced
sweetness
low
bitter
especially
for
a
dark
and
great
texture
it
runs
a
little
flat
so
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
carbonation
but
overall
one
of
my
favorite
dark
beers
another
solid
offering
from
bbc
that
im
glad
to
have
as
part
of
a
sampler
d
high
could
drink
several
but
will
enjoy
the
one
a
rather
doughy
quality
lager
with
a
nice
malt
quality
that
give
it
a
bit
of
body
and
a
bit
of
sweet
foamy
lace
coca
cola
without
a
light
carbonation
that
is
a
sharp
on
the
tongue
smell
of
chocolate
and
toastiness
but
mild
to
the
scent
of
grass
a
good
drink
for
the
summer
if
youre
looking
for
something
malty
better
than
most
american
black
beers
d
very
good
drinkability
this
isnt
the
kind
of
beer
thats
meant
to
be
thrown
back
but
it
will
definitely
leave
you
wanting
another
overall
it
seemed
a
bit
average
it
was
okay
and
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
but
there
was
nothing
that
would
keep
me
going
back
again
and
again
i
will
be
moving
on
as
it
warms
up
the
presence
of
alcohol
starts
to
show
itself
embrace
it
this
is
a
tasty
brew
is
it
too
much
to
ask
for
this
one
to
be
available
on
tap
in
the
winter
around
here
d
nice
at
the
beginning
but
rather
fast
becomes
bitter
with
a
medium
lasting
and
bitter
ending
o
quite
pleased
with
this
sam
adams
i
was
skeptical
at
first
but
this
is
a
treat
nice
roasted
malts
w
a
great
complimentary
chocolate
malt
profile
will
drink
again
d
very
downable
and
a
pretty
damn
good
schwarzbier
not
my
favourite
but
i
would
definitely
crack
open
a
bottle
if
i
saw
one
laying
around
i
wont
go
so
far
as
to
recommend
it
but
i
would
definitely
drink
another
or
three
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
since
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
lagers
it
pours
a
smooth
very
dark
brown
with
a
smallish
white
head
has
a
malty
aroma
like
a
porter
the
taste
is
nice
has
a
good
balance
between
hops
and
sweet
malt
flavor
goes
down
smooth
isnt
as
thick
as
a
stout
or
porter
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
beers
would
make
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
is
superb
its
a
great
session
beer
d
a
rich
and
creamy
beer
one
was
enough
for
me
nice
shwarzbier
d
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
back
in
the
winterfall
though
because
of
its
lightness
its
not
hard
to
put
down
in
warmer
temperatures
i
could
definitely
drink
more
of
these
in
a
sitting
one
of
sams
best
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
it
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
at
a
very
reasonable
price
d
great
beer
to
drink
with
food
or
alone
nice
to
change
it
up
a
little
one
of
my
favorite
sa
offerings
d
its
a
decent
brew
that
is
widely
available
but
not
a
repeat
purchase
d
definitely
good
would
go
well
with
grilled
meats
drinkability
wise
i
just
dont
see
myself
ever
drinking
this
beer
again
it
has
low
abv
so
you
could
drink
a
few
if
you
liked
it
only
redeeming
factor
there
overall
a
very
good
beer
one
i
would
definitely
buy
again
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
refreshing
and
flavorful
drinkiability
yes
please
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
few
d
very
drinkable
light
on
the
tongue
but
interesting
another
great
bbq
brew
taste
is
burnt
chocolate
dark
chocolate
and
some
significant
maltiness
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
but
enjoyable
for
what
it
has
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
heavy
body
a
litter
bitter
on
the
tailend
making
this
a
little
less
enticing
for
a
long
run
of
drinks
ive
had
this
one
a
few
times
before
and
will
grab
it
again
when
the
mood
strikes
run
of
the
mill
offering
here
from
sa
perhaps
not
there
best
offering
compared
to
other
well
made
brews
from
them
pass
this
one
up
if
in
search
of
a
delicious
black
lager
d
a
pretty
tasty
drinkable
beer
that
i
often
overlook
very
nice
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
i
enjoyed
it
and
if
you
are
a
fan
of
schwarzbiers
take
a
chance
on
this
one
because
you
wont
be
disappointed
drinkability
great
beer
its
a
winner
although
when
i
saw
that
sam
adams
was
making
a
black
lager
i
really
didnt
have
any
doubts
its
a
rich
and
bold
beer
that
still
goes
down
easy
the
boston
beer
company
found
a
winner
with
the
black
lager
as
soon
as
i
poured
it
from
the
bottle
i
was
impressed
with
the
rich
dark
appearance
and
aromas
of
chocolate
grain
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
hint
of
smokiness
has
a
sweet
taste
but
not
to
overpowering
i
felt
it
was
a
bit
heavier
than
a
typical
lager
but
all
in
all
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
and
will
buy
it
again
in
the
future
poured
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
is
black
until
held
up
to
the
light
which
reveals
nice
mahogany
edges
the
head
is
light
foam
about
a
fingers
width
theres
a
nice
cap
of
retention
and
good
lacing
aromas
include
some
coffee
with
a
fitting
acidity
caramel
and
bitter
chocolate
on
the
nose
and
its
all
followed
up
with
a
smokiness
thats
bordering
on
burnt
but
not
overwhelming
flavors
are
floral
in
an
almost
soapy
sense
but
also
not
overwhelming
or
unpleasant
mild
astringency
and
husky
big
roasty
flavor
with
an
emphasis
on
the
caramel
more
so
than
the
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
crisply
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
and
light
residuals
not
a
bad
6er
to
hang
out
with
on
a
rainy
day
d
wonderful
taste
very
smooth
easy
on
the
mouth
and
throat
somewhat
heavy
on
the
stomach
would
most
definitely
drink
this
again
just
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
in
a
sitting
drinkability
this
is
quite
drinkable
due
to
the
nice
flavor
and
low
abv
i
would
definitely
quaff
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
overall
of
course
im
sure
other
black
lagers
exist
out
there
but
ive
never
had
another
one
and
i
dont
know
many
people
who
have
this
is
an
awesome
gateway
beer
overall
opinion
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
also
would
not
hunt
it
down
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
this
style
should
be
really
proves
the
common
misconception
about
dark
beer
heavy
all
wrong
drinkability
is
not
good
if
i
dont
like
the
flavor
why
drink
it
pours
into
a
glass
a
nice
black
with
a
good
head
the
smell
hints
of
chocolate
and
of
being
roasted
the
taste
seems
to
carry
over
the
roasted
flavor
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
finish
slightly
bitter
it
is
smooth
with
a
good
body
and
maintains
the
feel
throughout
this
is
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
winter
evening
relaxing
next
to
the
fireplace
mild
drinking
very
little
in
the
way
of
power
or
offense
here
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
nice
black
lager
would
probably
be
a
good
crowd
pleaser
during
the
colder
months
i
could
really
get
into
a
case
of
this
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
it
has
some
really
pleasant
characters
its
just
that
they
seem
either
muted
or
otherwise
slightly
insipid
drinkable
enough
but
not
necessarily
something
id
seek
out
or
even
bother
trying
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
and
has
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
nothing
complicated
for
the
style
but
thats
not
a
detraction
here
these
go
down
nice
and
easy
and
i
welcome
them
into
my
home
d
a
very
drinkable
example
of
a
schwarzbier
albeit
more
roasty
than
some
but
well
within
accepted
guidelines
for
the
style
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
offerings
imo
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
flavors
are
pretty
easy
almost
like
a
pilsner
due
to
a
load
of
pils
malt
i
guess
abv
is
manageable
comments
looks
very
much
like
a
dry
stout
but
tastes
nothing
like
them
a
truly
delightful
brew
that
will
be
welcome
in
my
fridge
any
time
drinkability
great
example
of
a
schwarzbier
once
again
proving
that
sam
adams
can
make
really
good
german
session
lagers
terrific
beer
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
around
dark
rich
color
matches
the
smell
and
taste
you
really
cant
drink
many
of
them
though
definetely
a
beer
for
food
and
thats
about
it
its
heavy
malty
sweet
and
a
bit
nutty
its
your
typical
dark
beer
but
does
everything
really
well
drinkability
this
brewery
to
me
is
often
hit
or
miss
and
this
is
a
definite
hit
a
really
nice
beer
that
while
i
couldnt
drink
as
a
session
i
could
have
with
a
great
meal
expecting
a
thicker
taste
after
the
smell
and
appearance
i
was
relieved
to
find
that
this
brew
was
still
light
with
plenty
of
taste
a
pretty
decent
mouthfeel
lends
greatly
to
the
drinkability
if
youre
a
lager
person
this
is
a
great
brew
in
my
opinion
its
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
heavy
i
like
it
d
highly
drinkable
winter
beer
low
abv
makes
it
great
for
a
session
on
cold
nights
lightness
and
crispness
dont
weigh
you
down
well
crafted
i
recall
this
being
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
interested
in
craft
brews
provides
a
nice
solid
redbrown
hue
against
the
light
otherwise
appearing
a
few
shades
lighter
than
pitch
black
smells
very
grainy
and
nothing
else
nice
dark
chocolate
tones
that
is
also
rich
with
a
lot
of
nutty
notes
as
well
particular
to
hazelnut
sits
nice
and
easy
upon
consumption
honestly
nothing
i
would
have
again
ive
had
better
experiences
with
black
beers
this
is
still
a
solid
work
though
the
pour
is
very
dark
brown
but
it
has
lots
of
ruby
highlights
showing
through
when
held
to
light
smells
of
bready
sweetness
along
with
touches
of
coffee
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
taste
was
a
virtual
match
with
the
scent
theres
also
a
slight
touch
of
hops
that
is
palatable
in
the
finish
itd
be
nice
if
this
was
more
pronounced
feel
was
a
bit
thin
and
watery
poors
a
rich
dark
dark
brown
into
my
sam
adams
lager
glass
this
light
brown
head
which
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
nutty
and
roasted
and
caramel
good
carbonation
not
as
rich
as
i
expected
from
the
color
relatively
light
on
the
tongue
very
light
lacing
on
the
glass
which
evaporates
quickly
flavors
of
caramel
roastedness
and
good
hops
a
nice
warming
sensation
mostly
in
the
throat
light
effervescence
with
a
smooth
texture
a
good
brew
especially
from
a
brewery
this
size
really
good
with
chocolate
chip
cookies
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
moreso
because
it
is
so
average
i
feel
like
this
is
just
one
small
ingredient
away
from
being
a
very
good
beer
but
comes
up
short
a
very
nice
session
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
flavor
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
assume
that
schwarzbier
isnt
the
mose
complex
style
but
this
seems
like
a
good
representation
of
others
the
lager
was
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
clean
goblet
not
really
impressed
with
the
appearance
the
beer
is
black
with
absolutely
no
head
the
aroma
was
average
with
hints
of
roasted
grain
the
beer
had
a
nice
rich
and
smooth
flavor
of
roasted
grains
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
hops
drinkability
is
good
but
this
style
of
beer
is
meant
to
be
savored
not
swilled
pretty
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
expected
moreys
bottom
line
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
is
well
crafted
for
sure
would
gladly
drink
again
but
probably
wouldnt
purchase
with
my
own
money
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
some
malts
and
chocolate
taste
is
also
malts
and
toffeesome
notes
of
chocolate
slight
bitterness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
1
pint
mug
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
its
a
bit
heavy
in
a
nonboozy
way
for
me
to
consider
throwing
back
more
than
one
of
these
drinkability
good
flavor
and
being
light
means
this
is
an
ideal
brew
for
spring
or
summer
when
you
still
want
to
enjoy
complex
flavors
but
dont
want
a
particularly
heavy
beer
d
excellent
beer
from
samuel
adams
d
good
looks
and
smells
but
doesnt
matter
because
the
taste
is
too
bland
and
uncharacteristic
value
decent
kind
of
like
a
porter
jr
i
really
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
ive
had
a
few
of
these
tonight
certainly
drinkable
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
nice
creamy
looking
head
that
goes
to
a
thin
film
excellent
lacing
nice
roasted
malt
aroma
hints
of
caramel
and
just
the
slightest
bitterness
of
chocolate
goes
down
so
nice
and
easy
very
clean
finish
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
unfortunantly
where
i
live
this
seems
to
be
the
only
black
lager
available
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
try
others
good
job
sa
drinkability
is
pretty
high
overall
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
boston
beer
even
if
its
no
black
tuesday
d
very
drinkable
easily
can
have
more
than
one
i
was
expecting
a
little
heavier
of
a
body
but
still
good
typical
sam
adams
great
quality
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
overall
impressions
well
balanced
flavors
overall
not
as
heavy
as
expected
from
appearance
looking
like
a
porter
or
stout
very
enjoyable
drinks
like
a
good
lager
and
i
would
certainly
enjoy
multiple
in
any
case
definitely
worth
getting
d
decent
drinkability
not
too
much
at
once
and
something
i
could
sit
and
have
a
few
at
a
time
d
this
is
very
drinkable
and
tasty
as
a
session
beer
i
prefer
a
stout
over
a
schwarzbier
but
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
with
a
lighter
body
while
retaining
the
malty
profile
i
like
in
a
stout
this
is
the
way
id
go
drinkability
despite
the
lighter
abv
this
one
is
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
drinker
d
a
pleasant
surprise
one
of
bbcs
better
offerings
id
wager
sam
adams
black
lager
is
the
best
schwarbier
from
this
side
of
the
atlantic
its
certainly
one
of
the
best
examples
ive
tried
to
date
sam
adams
makes
a
lot
of
beers
and
although
they
arent
all
winners
those
that
are
tend
to
be
untypically
good
if
you
like
flavourful
malty
clean
and
quenching
beers
then
this
is
something
that
should
definitely
interest
you
it
interested
me
enough
to
buy
again
d
i
liked
this
one
from
sam
adams
tried
it
in
a
sidebyside
with
duck
rabbits
schwarzbier
the
flavors
are
there
in
this
one
and
come
out
in
good
flavor
i
would
drink
this
one
again
d
respectable
but
not
much
more
being
a
fan
of
both
samuel
adams
and
schwarzbiers
i
was
slightly
let
down
pales
in
comparison
to
other
samuel
adams
offerings
pales
in
comparison
to
other
schwarzbiers
the
4
9
makes
it
sessionable
but
im
not
sure
this
is
something
i
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
ill
likely
pass
in
the
future
when
presented
with
viable
alternatives
pretty
good
schwarzbier
good
intro
to
the
style
d
very
drinkable
light
enough
and
sessionable
enough
that
i
think
that
i
shall
have
another
nothing
terribly
excting
but
it
is
what
sam
adams
does
with
a
lot
of
their
beers
simple
straight
forward
and
generally
good
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
bier
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
products
not
named
boston
lager
i
recommend
it
prosit
nice
ebony
color
with
a
lighter
tan
head
nose
is
all
roasted
malt
espresso
and
bitter
chocolate
the
taste
isnt
surprising
ive
had
quite
a
few
of
these
over
the
years
very
well
done
close
to
a
earning
a
score
higher
black
malt
and
roasted
malt
with
a
bitter
semisweet
chocolate
backbone
very
tasty
but
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
department
and
could
be
thicker
as
well
md
very
drinkable
doesnt
taste
like
a
typical
dark
malt
beer
very
smooth
and
drinkable
dark
brown
body
with
a
minimalist
offwhite
head
aroma
of
nice
roasted
malt
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
also
a
smooth
roasted
note
backed
by
just
a
touch
of
fresh
malt
flavor
that
has
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
hops
simply
balance
out
the
malt
and
the
result
is
a
nice
clean
finish
that
just
hints
of
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
about
average
maybe
just
a
hair
too
much
carbonation
that
keeps
the
beer
from
being
a
smooth
on
the
palate
as
it
is
in
flavor
drinkability
is
decent
i
would
drink
it
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
d
supremely
drinkable
at
4
9
abv
this
is
a
nice
choice
for
a
session
brew
extremely
well
done
delicious
the
clean
crisp
taste
of
a
larger
with
fullflavored
roasted
malt
lightmedium
body
slight
but
tight
carbonation
sam
adams
you
expect
that
good
drinkability
plan
on
getting
more
easy
to
drink
went
well
with
a
burger
probably
goes
well
with
ethnic
food
too
dnow
i
wouldnt
go
pounding
these
at
the
bar
but
definitely
something
to
kick
back
with
and
enjoy
with
a
hearty
meal
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
fallwinter
holidays
i
highly
reccomend
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
without
a
problem
nice
beer
smell
has
a
soft
roasted
aroma
along
with
some
sweet
caramel
even
a
hint
of
chocolate
its
light
and
clean
with
a
distinct
lager
aroma
to
it
taste
also
has
some
roasted
malt
and
some
sweeter
elements
of
caramel
and
chocolate
theres
a
grainy
bready
quality
to
it
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
balance
it
out
clean
and
smooth
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
flavors
are
a
bit
too
thin
although
the
flavor
overall
is
good
d
highly
recommended
im
a
big
fan
of
the
darker
beers
and
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
drinkability
this
is
a
great
tasting
lager
easy
to
drinkand
leaves
you
wanting
more
the
smokiness
of
the
beer
is
what
keeps
you
coming
back
highly
recommended
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
slightly
tanned
head
has
a
sweet
nose
with
a
hint
of
yeasty
chocolate
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
to
be
found
and
the
head
does
not
retain
long
more
smell
of
malt
sweetness
taste
has
a
medium
to
light
body
with
slight
bitter
crisp
finish
can
taste
notes
of
both
chocolate
and
coffee
low
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
welcomes
a
second
beer
as
it
warms
it
takes
on
some
toffee
taste
as
well
drinkability
this
is
a
tasty
wellbrewed
schwartzbier
and
one
ill
be
having
again
its
easy
to
drink
just
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
and
just
tasty
enough
to
leave
me
wanting
more
d
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
a
good
session
beer
for
autumn
its
great
to
see
this
style
represented
and
easily
accessible
cheers
drinkability
is
great
due
to
its
smooth
taste
and
smooth
finish
my
favorite
offering
from
boston
beer
company
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
have
had
it
many
of
times
but
i
took
about
a
three
year
break
from
sam
adams
i
just
happen
to
find
this
today
and
really
seemed
to
enjoy
it
this
brew
is
light
bodied
yet
very
tasty
with
a
good
mouthfeel
case
worthy
indeed
one
of
the
best
from
sam
adams
sam
adams
continues
to
impress
you
gotta
love
a
brewing
company
that
gives
you
a
craft
beer
taste
even
when
youre
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
rural
alabama
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
i
thought
it
was
more
along
the
lines
of
a
dry
irish
stout
than
a
fullfledged
schwarzbier
certainly
dont
avoid
this
but
i
wouldnt
go
searching
for
it
very
smooth
and
clean
full
of
rich
maltiness
and
just
a
touch
of
roastiness
easy
drinking
yet
full
of
flavor
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
a
lesserbrewed
style
and
proof
that
lowalcohol
germanstyle
lagers
can
have
much
more
depth
of
character
than
pale
golden
pilsenertype
brews
d
i
was
hoping
this
one
would
mature
on
warming
but
to
me
it
just
kind
of
got
a
bit
watery
and
blasé
but
hey
this
is
a
good
beer
in
a
small
town
where
the
selection
is
minimal
its
very
nice
to
find
this
in
stock

lightly
carbonated
a
bit

on

one
of
the
better
ones
from
sam
adams
overall
a
very
drinkable
flavorful
beer
packed
full
of
roasted
flavor
i
would
much
prefer
my
golden
lagers
and
kolchs
d
schwarzbier
is
great
in
the
end
this
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
sam
adams
a
good
flavorful
beer
that
serves
to
introduce
new
flavors
and
brewing
experiences
into
the
american
palate
d
decent
version
of
the
black
lager
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
german
and
czech
versions
very
easy
to
drink
due
to
crisp
carbonation
and
despite
having
dark
roasty
malts
not
overly
filling
and
quite
refreshing
id
have
to
say
this
is
quite
an
exceptional
beer
for
the
money
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
in
general
overall
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
ive
only
had
a
few
different
versions
of
a
black
lager
including
some
homebrewed
versions
definitely
a
great
schwarzbier
d
they
recommended
this
with
bbq
i
had
one
with
mexican
and
that
was
just
fine
by
me
this
is
my
first
schwarzbier
i
liked
the
refreshing
lager
mixed
with
malty
satisfaction
a
real
hybrid
id
really
like
to
try
this
again
not
blowing
my
mind
but
a
sound
brew
drinkability
somewhat
jives
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
all
that
sessionable
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
across
the
board
only
my
2nd
or
maybe
3rd
scwharzbier
but
a
solid
and
tasty
brew
regardless
of
style
its
light
and
maybe
a
tad
thin
in
terms
of
flavor
but
this
hit
the
spot
after
working
my
tail
off
in
my
new
house
notes
another
solid
beer
from
samuel
adams
wow
we
were
hanging
out
at
the
stonewood
ale
house
in
schaumburg
uil
when
i
decided
to
give
this
a
try
nice
rich
black
color
not
much
head
i
could
smell
the
chocolatecoffee
goodness
right
away
and
the
taste
was
right
along
with
that
plus
there
was
a
subtle
smokiness
to
the
beer
as
well
the
texture
is
a
little
thin
but
it
is
generally
well
balanced
i
dont
think
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
another
aspect
of
note
is
a
characteristic
of
most
sam
adams
beer
the
clean
and
crisp
taste
sam
adams
body
of
their
beers
is
a
foot
in
the
commercial
beer
and
a
foot
in
the
craft
beer
it
does
not
explode
with
the
pizzaz
of
a
microbrew
thats
trying
to
prove
itself
by
overwhelming
the
tongue
but
it
also
is
not
as
bland
and
watered
down
as
a
miller
or
coors
beer
note
palate
becomes
shot
after
halfway
through
each
sausage
as
the
spice
level
is
so
high
so
if
planning
on
reviewing
this
beer
do
so
before
eating
too
many
bites
of
the
sausage
i
find
the
sam
adams
black
lager
to
be
very
drinkable
its
not
the
tastiest
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
a
nice
beer
at
the
low
abv
end
below
5
very
drinkable
like
a
light
stout
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
nothing
exceptional
dont
switch
from
this
one
to
something
lighter
though
you
wont
like
either
we
tried
a
black
white
night
with
sams
spring
seasonal
not
recommended
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
not
too
bad
id
drink
it
again
d
easy
to
toss
back
several
of
these
compared
to
average
stout
id
say
i
could
put
more
of
these
back
in
a
session
pours

with
ruby

medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
finish
that
compromises
between
being
drying
and
sticky
sweet
tasty
definitely
one
of
their
better
offerings
it
is
drinkable
because
it
is
pretty
thin
beer
but
the
bitter
taste
makes
it
more
difficult
to
put
down
md
drys
up
a
bit
towards
the
end
but
not
too
much
refreshing
highly
drinkable
lowish
abv
and
complex
taste
make
for
a
great
session
beer
d
not
a
lager
fan
but
id
have
this
again
for
sure
tastes
d
low
abv
means
you
could
put
a
couple
of
these
away
easy
fairly
smooth
decent
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
better
and
one
of
the
few
schwarzbiers
out
there
a
great
dark
session
beer
with
loads
of
flavor
but
a
lighter
body
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
even
in
warmer
weather
a
really
welldone
beer
by
sa
in
my
opinion
ive
been
impressed
by
the
brewmasters
collection
so
far
the
irish
red
ale
was
also
quite
tasty
at
just
4
90
abv
this
is
a
totally
sessionable
beer
and
one
that
i
would
happily
revisit
in
the
future
superior
to
the
handful
of
other
american
craft
black
lagers
ive
had
in
the
past
not
a
bad

beerfor
dessert
rather
than
with
dessert
pours
from
the
bottle
a
dark

took
some
coaxing

show
up
and
quickly

roasted

here
the

theres
no

i
sort
of
expected
and
in
its
place
is
a
pleasant
sweetness
as
good
as
black
lager
tastes
however
its
creamy
soft
body
is
wonderful
and
something
ive
not
found
in
any
other
beer
as
light
and
pleasant
as
this
beer
i
could
drink
several
of
them
d
its
a
lighter
beer
and
very
enjoyable
d
as
schwarzbiers
go
this
one
is
very
decent
but
a
bit
more
viscous
than
im
used
to
for
the
style
its
still
a
drinkable
veer
but
i
think
it
sits
a
bit
heavier
while
still
lighter
than
it
would
appear
d
its
good
not
amazing
not
sure
if
id
shell
out
for
a
full
sixer
but
a
worthy
varietypack
member
i
can
taste
the
chocolate
and
the
appropriate
hop
finish
what
surprises
me
is
the
smokiness
in
the
beer
its
pretty
prominent
its
tasty
if
a
bit
weird
nice
medium
bodied
schwarzbier
leave
it
to
bbc
to
get
this
done
right
i
could
session
this
all
day
long
drinkability
i
like
the
style
and
sam
adams
has
produced
a
nice
black
lager
i
would
purchase
again
very
dark
but
not
opaque
clear
chestnut
colour
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
lots
of
foam
off
the
pour
which
settled
to
a
half
inch
cap
and
left
tons
of
streakyclumpy
lace
on
the
glass
malty
aroma
hints
of
milk
chocolate
and
cola
nut
roast
and
caramel
bitterness
melded
nicely
with
the
dark
grains
giving
it
a
bittersweet
chocolate
character
malt
dominated
but
a
kiss
of
hop
flavour
and
bitterness
were
evident
towards
the
finish
texture
was
alright
a
little
on
the
thin
side
once
the
carbonation
subsided
but
still
fine
pretty
tasty
overall
id
certainly
come
back
to
this
again
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
deep
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
with
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
medium
roasted
grains
a
bit
of
caramel
and
brown
bread
tastes
of
bittersweet
chocolate
sweet
caramelized
malts
roasted
grains
and
bready
malt
a
bit
thin
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
slightly
sticky
i
had
no
problem
going
through
my
six
pack
d
after
having
some
scharzbiers
in
germany
i
must
say
that
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
this
was
one
of
my
first
craft
beers
on
my
path
to
enlightenment
its
great
that
boston
beer
company
has
made
this
being
a
rarer
style
this
also
tends
to
be
considered
one
of
the
better
beers
that
bbc
makes
and
i
agree
with
that
it
is
great
when
you
want
some
chocolate
or
roasted
flavors
without
the
heaviness
of
a
stout
or
porter
its
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
but
it
is
another
good
offering
from
them
drinkability
yes
more
than
one
it
is
a
good
beer
lots
of
flavor
even
my
wife
enjoys
it
and
she
doesnt
like
the
dark
beers
drinkability
is
iffy
just
too
sweet
balanced
for
awhile
but
more
roasty
acidity
is
needed
to
balance
final
thoughts
surprisingly
light
in
body
and
flavor
when
noticing
the
intial
appearance
of
the
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
in
a
12
pack
mix
or
a
sixer
d
great
session
brew
clean
and
light
but
lots
of
flavor
bottom
line
this
is
an
average
beer
nothing
great
about
it
but
nothing
bad
about
it
either
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
buy
it
again
but
that
is
not
to
say
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
d
very
drinkable
not
too
bitter
or
too
sweet
d
easy
to
drink
and
with
descent
flavor
its
one
you
can
take
a
few
down
and
enjoy
but
it
just
didnt
offer
anything
really
impressive
sam
adams
black
lager
is
considerably
light
bodiedperhaps
a
touch
on
the
watery
side
evenbut
mellow
and
smooth
very
high
drinkability
and
id
gladly
drink
multiple
glasses
of
this
very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
who
dont
think
that
they
like
malt
tastedark
beer
thinmedium
in
body
it
seem
almost
like
a
lighter
body
version
of
a
porter
or
stout
higher
carbonation
than
porterstouts
very
black
but
red
too
not
blood
red
but
more
along
the
lines
of
a
dark
unkept
redwood
set
above
a
fire
place
mantle
in
a
castle
somewhere
in
medieval
bavaria
looks
a
whole
lot
like
a
porter
and
has
a
beautiful
cream
toasted
head
that
smells
like
caramel
and
chocolate
not
really
up
front
but
there
def
there
good
retention
and
leaves
a
tapestry
of
along
the
side
of
the
glass
for
the
duration
it
tastes
like
a
porter
too
but
not
in
the
same
burnt
way
that
sam
adams
honey
porter
comes
across
in
fact
it
has
a
subtle
undertone
of
caramel
and
is
alot
lighter
than
a
porter
it
has
a
dry
finish
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
buy
it
or
get
the
variety
pack
like
i
did
and
spend
the
night
reviewing
3
good
beers
dlight
and
with
a
low
abv
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
but
i
will
not
buy
this
again
surprisingly
nice
thought
it
would
be
just
ok
d
smooth
beer
nothing
too
sweet
or
too
bitter
nice
balance
overall
would
also
like
to
add
that
it
goes
very
well
with
my
sceczwan
stirfry
basically
good
with
spicy
food
drinkability
notes
got
this
in
a
brewmeister
pack
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
super
great
either
a
nice
stab
at
a
schwarzbier
drinkability
i
could
easily
session
this
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
offerings
just
unique
and
smoky
enough
this
is
probably
my
favorite
from
sam
adams
creamy
but
not
too
heavy
with
a
great
roastiness
flavor
for
a
lager
wish
i
could
buy
a
case
of
this
in
all
a
decent
beer
but
ill
probably
stick
to
sams
more
sophisticated
brews
smell
is
nutty
with
hits
of
malts
initial
taste
is
actually
like
a
toasted
pecan
almost
get
a
slight
smoky
bacon
taste
but
beer
is
lighter
than
it
looks
common
for
this
style
nice
on
palate
and
definitely
follows
through
with
a
great
finish
tastes
like
roasted
chocolate
esspresso
beans
and
creme
brulee
very
beery
though
and
not
at
all
dessert
like
its
a
bit
nutty
over
all
pretty
good
nice
example
by
sa
of
a
schwarzbier
really
need
to
try
this
fresh
to
properly
review
it
but
as
is
its
still
pretty
tasty
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
thin
beige
head
with
little
retention
the
smell
is
heavy
on
the
chocolate
malt
very
little
else
is
noticeable
the
taste
is
chocalately
from
the
malt
there
is
also
a
slight
spice
from
the
hops
but
the
malt
clearly
dominates
the
flavor
of
this
is
nicely
mild
and
does
not
overpower
the
palate
which
i
enjoy
in
this
case
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
complements
the
mild
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
i
can
have
a
lot
of
without
being
overpowered
by
the
flavor
thus
i
find
this
brew
extremely
drinkable
and
a
favorite
session
beer
of
mine
completely
worth
the
effort
to
try
rr
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
schwartzbiers
are
pretty
hard
to
find
but
this
is
a
fine
and
easily
accessible
example
good
fallwinter
beer
good
beer
but
as
with
many
sam
adams
brew
i
think
there
are
better
options
out
there
in
this
price
range
d
the
roasty
flavor
is
enjoyable
but
could
be
balanced
out
by
some
bitterness
however
this
beer
is
smooth
and
warming
an
easy
drinker
d
extremely
drinkable
very
smooth
makes
me
want
another
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
a
beer
that
felt
so
good
in
my
mouth
this
is
a
truly
great
creation
from
our
friends
at
the
boston
beer
company
it
tastes
amazing
with
a
deep
rich
flavor
and
a
deep
dark
appearance
the
only
knock
i
have
on
this
beer
is
that
it
isnt
particularly
drinkable
i
can
only
have
two
or
three
of
these
before
my
taste
buds
are
overwhelmed
allaround
great
beer
however
not
a
favorite
from
sam
adams
no
real
aroma
too
it
the
color
is
a
very
deep
black
color
there
is
little
texture
and
the
taste
is
soso
you
could
drink
alot
of
them
because
they
are
in
fact
very
smooth
going
down
overall
it
is
soso
if
it
is
on
hand
and
your
other
alternatives
are
bud
go
for
it
medium
to
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
wasnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
think
it
could
grow
on
me
sa
black
lager
really
could
be
close
to
a
session
beer
but
for
me
it
seems
like
this
one
might
get
a
little
boring
after
a
while
d
excellent
these
go
down
very
easy
solid
but
ive
had
better
d
very
drinkable
though
a
bit
mild
in
flavor
and
aroma
for
a
schwarzbier
given
the
price
this
is
one
that
ill
be
picking
up
again
this
is
a
good
one
to
make
a
regular
for
someone
in
a
mood
for
a
darker
beer
would
buy
again
in
the
future
cheers
this
is
my
second
beer
of
this
style
and
i
believe
this
one
is
closer
to
a
good
example
than
the
other
i
tried
its
definitely
worth
a
try
and
it
will
probably
make
regular
stops
in
my
home
cheers
overall
impression
this
beer
has
all
of
the
character
you
would
want
in
a
heavier
beer
but
with
the
drinkability
of
something
lighter
a
sessionable
beer
but
its
not
lacking
full
of
flavor
i
especially
love
the
smoky
lingering
finish
drinkability
easy
drinking
and
tasty
a
great
dark
beer
that
you
can
session
normally
a
single
serving
will
due
for
a
review
yet
four
were
consumed
reviewing
this
beer
so
enough
said
taste
is
smooth
and
moderate
for
the
color
of
the
beer
a
bit
smokyhoppy
and
with
a
moderate
and
well
balanced
malt
structure
noting
that
this
is
a
schwarzbier
an
unfamiliar
style
yet
this
is
easily
the
best
brew
in
my
mixocase
from
costco
inviting
and
flavorful
i
look
forward
to
another
d
this
was
the
first
beer
i
truly
enjoyed
and
for
a
while
it
was
my
session
beer
its
a
very
good
schwarzbier
a
dark
red
to
black
color
with
a
dense
dark
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
roasted
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
with
some
light
dusty
spicyness
smooth
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
flavor
starts
out
with
a
quick
dark
roast
malt
some
dark
caramel
in
the
background
then
you
get
some
smooth
chocolatelygrainy
flavors
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
spice
from
hops
blending
into
the
mix
a
very
balanced
enjoyablesessionable
beer
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
sam
d
very
easy
to
drink
at
just
5
nothing
to
cloying
or
overwhelming
but
full
flavored
very
nice
d
very
drinkable
not
overly
carbonated
mfd
nicely
balanced
as
i
said
before
very
bittersweet
in
my
humble
opinion
nice
body
on
this
one
very
drinkable
for
its
style
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
thin
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
whipped
mousselike
three
fingers
of
sand
colored
foam
resting
on
top
that
lasts
and
leaves
very
little
lace
smells
of
coffee
and
sweet
malt
and
something
close
to
a
three
musketeers
candy
bar
smell
tastes
rich
and
malty
coffee
and
chocolate
decent
lighter
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
not
exactly
what
i
think
of
in
terms
of
a
german
schwarzbier
but
nice
and
different
this
is
a
rather
light
beer
for
as
dark
as
it
looks
while
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
when
i
look
away
and
turn
back
i
keep
hoping
that
it
will
be
as
hearty
as
it
looks
but
alas
that
is
not
the
case
perhaps
a
nice
change
when
youre
just
not
up
for
a
heavy
stout
but
want
others
to
think
youre
having
one
i
guess
this
is
anything
but
a
glowing
review
but
i
actually
do
like
this
beer
dark
black
with
three
fingers
of
tan
creamy
head
pretty
good
lacing
and
head
retention
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
a
slight
bit
of
hops
taste
was
much
the
same
had
a
bit
of
a
spicy
character
sweet
malts
and
finished
with
a
bit
of
black
licorice
taste
overall
not
too
bad
a
bit
of
a
watery
taste
the
beer
was
pretty
smooth
not
much
carbonation
and
overall
pretty
drinkable
would
buy
again
in
the
future
pours
a
deep
dark
brownblack
color
some
light
falls
through
big
foamy
head
decent
lacing
somewhat
lasting
not
a
very
strong
aroma
malts
some
hops
weak
but
not
unpleasant
watery
malty
taste
not
too
strong
just
average
clean
aftertaste
not
much
else
to
it
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
taste
smooth
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinking
it
will
buy
again
kudos
samuel
adams
right
for
the
style
seems
like
this
should
be
thicker
than
it
is
thinner
mouthfeel
but
highly
drinkable
a
good
rep
of
the
style
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
real
deal
german
ones
available
but
if
you
cant
find
them
this
is
a
good
alternative
i
had
3
different
beers
during
the
superbowl
and
this
is
the
one
i
kept
going
back
to
d
big
time
d
here
low
abv
great
taste
makes
this
a
superb
session
beer
i
agree
with
everything
written
about
this
beer
you
would
think
looking
at
it
in
the
glass
that
it
would
be
overpoweringly
dense
sweet
or
syrupy
on
the
contrary
normally
i
sway
to
heavy
hoped
beers
but
the
level
of
hops
in
this
one
is
really
nice
a
really
nice
beer
im
very
impressed
with
this
dark
lager
a
lot
of
darker
beers
tend
to
get
too
crafty
and
try
to
overpower
you
with
bitterness
or
high
alcohol
content
this
beer
avoids
these
pitfalls
when
poured
from
the
bottle
there
was
a
nice
two
fingers
of
creamy
colored
fine
bubble
foam
the
color
of
the
beer
was
just
as
the
label
indicated
black
and
opague
a
nice
aroma
reminiscent
of
carmelized
vanilla
and
some
other
spice
i
cant
identify
slightly
sweet
in
flavor
for
a
beer
described
as
a
black
lager
would
have
liked
to
have
more
alcohol
kick
to
compliment
the
mild
hop
notes
mfd
a
little
thin
but
very
easy
to
drink
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
d
pretty
good
ill
have
another
goes
down
very
easily
so
does
the
second
and
the
third
quite
possibly
my
favorited
sam
adams
it
has
a
mild
smoky
flavor
to
it
like
a
porter
but
a
smooth
lager
taste
and
mild
aroma
has
a
rusty
feel
to
it
tastes
closer
to
a
porter
than
a
lager
its
an
odd
taste
for
a
lager
it
tastes
very
good
all
around
a
nice
drinkable
dark
beer
i
liked
this
beer
and
thought
that
it
would
go
well
as
an
after
dinner
drink
instead
of
coffee
not
just
because
of
the
coffee
flavours
but
its
overall
profile
of
smooth
and
bitter
mimics
a
good
espresso
coffee
not
my
favorite
by
a
long
shot
but
not
horrible
pours
black
moderate
beige
head
pleasant
aroma
with
chocolate
and
smoke
flavors
evident
diminishing
head
with
good
lacing
throughout
smooth
nice
finish
part
of
sa
holiday
brewmasters
pack
enjoyable
but
would
probably
not
buy
in
quantity
near
black
pour
with
an
off
white
head
roast
malt
aroma
fairly
mild
flavors
chocolatecaramel
roasted
malts
nothing
overpowering
well
balanced
and
drinkable
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
at
all
pick
it
over
bud
or
whatever
other
crap
is
at
the
supermarket
love
this
dark
lager
delicious
give
me
more
why
are
not
on
draught
in
boston
dark
color
decent
head
wonderful
darkroasted
malts
and
just
the
slightest
hops
no
overwhelming
coffee
or
chocolate
hints
and
the
perfect
body
for
drinkability
keep
em
comin
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
very
dark
and
looked
like
heavy
stout
the
head
on
the
beer
was
a
nice
tan
color
but
it
did
not
last
very
long
the
smell
was
smokey
and
a
little
nutty
the
taste
was
the
same
with
a
hint
of
coffee
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
d
if
im
going
to
have
coffee
and
chocolate

the
schwarz
style
its
really
not

bad
at
all

its
a

this

sam
adams
seems
to
me
to
make
a
wide
range
of
decent
beers
in
a

of
styles

nothing
too
impressive
this
is
one
of
their
better
beers

very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
i
could
drink
this
one
after
the
other
without
a
complaint
in
the
world
my
favorite
style
and
this
represents
it
well
also
my

could
be
a
good
session
beer
if
you
like
black

unexpectedly
this
is

definitely

very
drinkable
good
session
beer
highly
recommended
more
proof
that
sam
adams
is
emerging
if
not
already
is
as
the
king
of
american
beers
a
great
combination
of
lager
smoothness
with
just
a
hint
of
roasted
character
no
noticeable
hop
character
d
this
beer
was
very
interesting
a
very
sessionable
lager
that
has
little
hop
flavor
but
thats
what
they
were
going
for
but
full
of
something
unique
this
schwarzbier
is
a
rare
style
in
america
but
samuel
adams
did
a
great
job
here
pours
black
throughout
the
middle
with
brownish
red
highlights
at
the
edges
smells
of
sweet
molasses
and
caramel
with
a
smoky
background
tastes
sweet
and
malty
with
burnt
edges
this
beer
is
light
and
crisp
and
rather
refreshing
for
its
look
fairly
well
carbonated
and
drinkable
d
nice
change
of
pace
type
of
beer
to
be
honest
ive
never
been
a
huge
lager
fan
this
isnt
bad
but
its
still
a
lager
the
elevated
malt
profile
is
not
bad
but
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
it
were
this
beer
really
slides
down
very
smoothly
with
great
texture
to
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
well
after
each
sip
i
looked
forward
to
the
next
most
drinkable
dark
beer
ive
ever
had
because
its
light
bodied
enough
that
you
can
have
many
if
you
want
edit
i
saw
some
people
saying
there
isnt
much
roastedcoffeechocolate
flavors
here
thats
complete
hogwash
get
a
fresh
one
of
these
and
those
are
the
most
pronounced
flavors
d
on
the
whole
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
really
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
in
any
particular
way
d
an
easy
beer
to
drink
i
could
sit
down
and
have
a
few
at
a
time
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
be
satisfied
sam
adams
black
lager
is
a
very
good
choice
of
a
sociable
beer
not
a
treat
by
any
means
pours
mostly
black
with
some
translucency
and
rubyness
to
it
nice
head
retention
watery
and
a
little
astringent
but
otherwise
very
clean
just
a
touch
of
roasted
black
patent
malt
but
very
clean
and
appropriate
for
a
schwarzbier
mostly
clean
aftertaste
with
hints
of
smoke
and
charcoal
a
faint
hop
spice
accompanies
the
roasted
malt
nicely
mediumthin
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
seems
a
little
excessive
a
nice
clean
schwarzbier
but
i
think
it
could
benefit
from
just
a
little
more
flavor
overall
it
reminds
me
of
the
schwarzbier
i
used
to
drink
out
of
a
2
l
boot
in
germany
in
terms
of
its
drinkability
and
overall
appeal
as
a
beer
dquite
drinkable
in
that
i
could
drink
another
due
to
its
smooth
lager
characteristics
went
down
enjoyably
overall
not
my
favorite
but
a
nice
one
d
not
full
flavored
there
is
flavor
but
it
is
not
burdoning
the
flavor
is
good
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
could
easily
be
an
everyday
beer
d
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
one
lighter
in
taste
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
really
worked
well
i
love
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
the
dark
lagers
in
munich
that
were
so
much
better
than
some
of
the
light
colored
lagers
so
easy
to
drink
but
also
very
tasty
looks
nice
in
a
glass
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
moderate
carbonation
a
little
caramel
and
roasty
in
smell
and
taste
but
very
clean
finish
and
nice
aftertaste
a
lot
in
common
with
nut
brown
ales
which
i
also
like
i
would
say
that
this
is
one
of
sam
adams
better
efforts
for
an
everyday
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tasting
glass
the
appearance
is
very
dark
with
12
head
which
dissipates
to
a
nice
sticky
lace
the
nose
has
malt
sweetness
and
figs
and
coffee
almost
like
a
stout
the
taste
is
really
nice
and
balance
initially
sweet
followed
be
enough
hops
to
round
out
the
flavor
this
medium
bodied
beer
makes
you
think
you
are
drinking
a
stout
but
the
finish
is
more
crisp
and
refreshing
really
nice
drinkability
for
the
flavor
of
the
beer
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
this
is
the
best
value
on
the
american
market
for
beer
although
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
its
up
there
and
its
always
a
trusty
option
when
a
bar
doesnt
have
a
good
selection
of
beer
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
a
sam
adams
product
d
a
really
good
call
i
had
two
bottles
from
my
sam
adams
mix
pack
i
had
originally
planned
on
saving
the
other
bottle
but
it
was
so
tasty
and
drinkable
i
went
ahead
and
had
it
nothing
too
outlandish
but
a
quality
beer
here
all
together
a
nice
brew
that
goes
down
real
smooth
i
think
i
might
start
being
a
sam
adams
fan
i
love
this
beer
by
sam
adams
and
i
think
this
could
be
one
of
my
favorite
versions
of
beer
it
pours
a
beautiful
dark
color
and
has
wonderful
rich
coffee
like
flavor
this
is
one
beer
i
want
to
enjoy
again
and
again
too
bad
it
seems
to
be
only
available
in
a
variety
pack
this
is
one
of
sam
adams
very
best
d
a
good
beer
that
i
would
get
again
and
surprisingly
drinkable
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
deep
brown
color
with
dazzling
ruby
highlights
ecru
head
of
a
half
finger
that
displays
average
retention
and
lacing
aromas
of
cocoa
milk
chocolate
and
graham
cracker
with
maybe
a
little
sweetened
coffee
very
alluring
smell
flavor
is
more
roasty
with
dark
chocolate
and
some
char
to
go
along
with
some
light
caramel
hops
play
a
minor
role
but
are
spicy
in
nature
and
a
welcome
spot
of
balance
mouthfeel
is
typically
sam
adams
just
a
little
too
thin
to
support
the
flavor
profile
still
one
of
the
best
of
their
regular
lineup
a
nice
schwarzbier
maybe
not
as
flavorful
as
sprechers
but
maybe
a
little
easier
to
drink
because
of
that
a
nice
beer
from
a
good
brewery
overall
do
it
poured
from
bottle
to
new
sam
adams
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
red
hues
and
an
almost
non
existent
cream
head
that
quickly
disolved
with
no
lacing
to
speak
of
it
had
a
minimal
malt
aroma
and
a
trace
of
caramel
sweetness
but
not
the
strong
nose
i
had
expected
tastes
like
roasted
malts
with
some
sweetness
of
chocolate
and
caramel
over
carbonated
and
thin
very
disapointing
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
thin
weak
overly
carbonated
false
advertising
i
can
not
understand
the
fascination
with
the
swill
these
guys
pump
out
i
try
and
go
into
every
sam
adams
beer
with
an
open
mind
but
always
walk
away
scratching
my
head
just
once
i
would
like
to
say
this
is
a
great
sam
adams
beer
sadly
i
cannot
say
that
here
d
pretty
good
goes
down
smooth
my
bottle
of
samuel
adams
black
lager
came
from
a
24
pack
brewmasters
collection
it
quickly
became
my
favorite
of
the
box
it
pours
dark
with
a
small
head
it
smells
of
burnt
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
it
tastes
exactly
the
same
way
but
i
can
detect
a
little
coffee
flavor
mixed
in
as
well
this
beer
has
a
very
pleasant
flavor
and
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
it
looks
thick
but
i
soon
found
out
that
that
the
opposite
is
true
its
light
flavor
and
dark
color
make
one
interesting
brew
i
feel
like
this
beer
can
stand
up
to
most
schwarzbiers
very
drinkable
and
recommended
poured
this
one
aggressively
out
of
the
bottle
and
it
still
yielded
little
more
than
a
thin
tan
head
poor
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
deep
and
blackened
like
charred
meat
burnt
malt
and
hints
of
hops
at
the
end
the
flavors
were
at
first
of
bittersweet
chocolate
followed
by
black
coffee
and
then
at
the
end
the
smoky
and
blackened
flavors
kick
in
nice
malt
and
hops
balance
but
the
finish
is
so
black
i
find
it
hard
not
to
think
it
would
put
many
off
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
little
off
too
much
carbonation
causes
it
to
be
frothy
and
hard
to
enjoy
for
a
beer
this
dark
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
also
not
a
good
example
of
the
german
schwarzbier
style
a
good
solid
schwarzbier
the
scwarzbier
dont
see
too
many
of
them
out
there
but
theyre
unique
to
say
the
least
the
color
is
jet
black
but
its
light
bodied
which
still
just
stuns
me
tastes
sort
of
smokey
and
has
some
chocolate
sort
of
taste
as
well
smell
is
a
little
below
good
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
well
done
d
not
full
flavored
but
the
flavor
is
good
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
the
style
a
beer
that
screams
session
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
session
beer
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
definately
get
again
beer
its
not
just
a
beverage
beer
is
food
good
and
interesting
brew
you
dont
see
this
style
done
much
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
am
not
a
huge
sams
fan
to
begin
with
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
thick
and
blacka
stout
like
apperance
a
decent
head
forms
and
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
it
smells
sweet
and
like
chocalate
the
initial
taste
is
of
sweet
molases
followed
by
a
light
smoke
finished
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
beer
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
was
much
better
than
i
expected
a
worth
while
brew
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
lager
big
on
flavor
and
body
i
enjoy
it
but
i
think
i
will
switch
to
another
beer
after
this
one
m
d
medium
bodied
beer
flowed
smoothly
down
very
high
quality
beer
not
your
big
hitter
but
alot
of
taste
that
is
very
refreshing
although
not
my
prefered
style
i
could
definately
knock
a
couple
of
these
back
for
sure
d
i
would
definitely
have
another
and
would
share
with
friends
but
they
damn
well
better
not
take
the
last
one
to
my
palate
most
sam
adams
beers
are
rather
pedestrian
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
most
the
nose
is
quite
malty
reminiscent
of
chocolate
malted
milk
balls
with
strong
notes
of
coffee
the
dark
malts
shine
in
the
tastedark
chocolate
and
coffee
with
spicy
hops
providing
balance
but
never
stealing
the
stage
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
light
but
not
watery
broken
record
here
another
very
good
session
brew
from
sa
possibly
the
best
sam
adams
i
have
had
feel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
like
for
the
style
although
all
around
enjoyable
drinkability
very
smooth
and
sweetish
chocolate
malts
dominate
but
i
dont
see
myself
having
more
than
1
of
these
overall
its
decent
but
not
too
sweet
to
be
annoying
very
drinkable
comment
i
prefer
other
beers
over
this
a
little
too
sweet
for
a
lager
in
my
opinion
id
drink
it
if
offered
but
ill
pass
on
buying
it
again
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
it
is
almost
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
will
have
it
again
in
the
future
drinkability
overall
a
very
nice
lager
clean
lager
flavor
lets
the
roasted
malts
shine
excellent
d
good
beer
and
overall
easy
to
drink
d
i
like
this
one
a
lot
its
got
some
nice
malt
character
and
decent
balance
and
its
smooth
and
agreeable
enough
to
enjoy
without
really
making
a
huge
effort
d
the
carbonation
was
really
the
only
off
putting
part
of
this
beer
poured
black
in
color
now
i
know
why
its
called
black
lager
had
a
nice
head
that
hung
around
a
while
also
had
good
lacing
that
left
rings
with
every
swallow
head
reminded
me
of
the
inside
of
caramel
candy
bar
that
color
kind
of
tan
smelled
of
smokey
malts
caramel
and
coffee
tasted
like
it
smelled
burnt
or
smokey
malt
coffee
and
caramel
mostly
of
coffee
felt
good
in
the
mouth
head
felt
thick
in
the
mouth
had
some
body
very
good
beer
sam
adams
did
a
good
job
on
this
one
this
is
good
but
its
a
bit
stoutlike
for
my
taste
i
mean
i
love
a
stout
but
this
is
a
schwarzbier
still
very
bood
but
needs
more
depth
pours
a
pitch
black
into
the
sam
adams
specialty
glass
and
is
finished
with
a
nice
dark
tan
head
head
retention
is
excellent
with
a
thick
lacing
left
all
round
the
glass
smells
of
caramel
tea
and
subtle
roasted
nuts
tastes
of
almost
hidden
smoked
malts
some
hops
and
a
subtle
base
of
sweetness
the
paradox
of
color
vs
taste
is
pleasing
youre
expecting
a
heavy
brew
but
you
get
a
tasty
but
very
drinkable
beer
here
i
would
recommend
giving
this
a
shot
if
your
looking
for
a
nice
dark
beer
goes
down
well
and
the
tastes
will
have
you
nodding
your
head
in
agreement
the
body
and
mouthfeel
is
much
lighter
than
its
appearance
suggests
nice
brew
if
feel
like
something
lighter
and
not
in
the
mood
for
a
big
satisfying
malt
bomb
an
interesting
style
indeed
from
a
mixed
12
pack
im
surprised
that
i
liked
this
as
much
as
i
did
pours
a
very
deep
amber
almost
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
aroma
is
chocolate
with
malt
flavor
is
roasted
malt
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
very
well
balanced
and
a
pretty
good
drink
i
was
pretty
stunned
by
this
one
not
at
all
what
i
expected
and
not
bad
d
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
on
the
palate
i
actually
caught
the
caramel
in
the
taste
along
with
some
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
as
well
i
thought
it
was
a
surprisingly
deep
beer
and
finished
smoothly
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
never
really
expect
anything
exceptional
from
sam
adams
but
this
stuff
is
damn
good
d
a
great
lager
for
sure
and
an
easy
drinker
it
is
a
little
heavy
and
the
dark
malts
make
for
a
slightly
more
intense
brew
so
i
doubt
i
would
drink
this
all
night
long
a
couple
of
these
wouldnt
be
bad
though
poured
a
deep
black
into
my
glass
mug
from
the
bottle
with
a
tan
fluffy
head
holding
it
up
to
the
light
i
could
detect
nice
rubies
around
the
edges
the
head
left
a
somewhat
decent
lace
down
the
walls
of
the
mug
also
it
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
smell
with
a
little
hint
of
something
else
that
i
cant
quite
place
on
the
first
sip
i
taste
some
nice
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
that
schwarzbier
tang
that
ive
come
to
enjoy
the
taste
gets
richer
and
more
complex
as
it
warms
up
add
to
all
that
a
nice
smooth
finish
and
mouthfeel
and
you
have
one
damn
tasty
and
drinkable
dark
lager
excellent
product
here
fantastic
schwarzbier
by
sammy
sweet
aroma
with
some
burnt
notesnot
too
prominent
but
still
enjoyable
great
pour
rich
amber
color
with
a
really
fluffy
tan
head
and
tons
of
lacing
creamy
as
can
be
mouthfeel
with
a
thick
finish
good
flavor
sweet
and
tangy
with
roasted
malts
and
that
burnt
taste
found
in
the
aroma
my
2nd
schwarz
and
i
can
now
detect
the
common
underlying
flavor
different
for
sure
this
style
can
be
very
good
as
seen
with
this
one
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
i
dont
see
done
a
whole
lot
goes
great
with
grill
food
af
a
very
pleasant
and
mild
aftertaste
of
wheat
bread
and
nuts
definately
a
good
beer
something
i
would
eat
with
brautwurst
or
another
greasy
smoky
meat
a
little
thick
and
was
not
a
fan
of
the
syrupyness
good
departure
from
the
average
lager
the
black
lager
lived
up
to
its
name
in
color
i
was
expecting
a
very
rich
flavor
and
while
sweet
it
was
lacking
depth
still
the
sweetness
lingered
in
the
end
and
was
not
all
that
bad
it
just
tasted
a
little
too
thin
for
such
a
dark
beer
then
again
this
was
my
first
beer
of
the
schwarz
variety
d
i
would
rate
this
fairly
high
its
good
from
here
ill
stop
the
beer
is
terrible
i
highly
suggest
you
avoid
it
this
beer
poured
a
nearblack
with
a
brown
tint
and
a
big
tan
head
with
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
some
bready
malt
sweetness
the
taste
was
mostly
sweet
slightlytoasted
malt
with
possibly
some
chocolate
or
coffee
porterlike
bits
in
the
middle
with
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
with
a
surprising
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
sits
a
little
heavy
but
i
could
still
imagine
having
two
or
three
in
a
sitting
without
feeling
too
full
di
would
grab
it
again
maybe
would
for
sure
drink
it
if
it
was
around
somewhere
would
really
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
d
drink
this
one
year
round
it
is
very
flavorful
satisfying
also
as
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
well
done
this
beer
is
dominated
by
roast
there
may
be
a
bit
too
much
for
style
but
it
is
hard
to
argue
with
the
end
result
black
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
good
persistent
head
nice
mouthfeel
again
lots
of
roast
in
this
beer
roast
in
the
front
and
the
back
good
beer
very
nice
color
mahogany
with
red
sides
good
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
gives
a
nice
creamy
feel
very
nice
nutty
chocolatey
taste
that
stays
on
the
palate
the
smell
is
how
it
tastes
not
overpoweringly
strong
but
pleasant
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
for
relaxing
in
the
evening
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
a
the
rare
fom
my
experience
schwarzbier
style
and
its
a
great
yearround
brew
pours
a
nearly
black
color
with
an
average
offwhite
head
that
settled
into
a
cap
the
aroma
is
malty
roasted
malt
is
quite
present
with
other
aromas
of
nuts
and
coffee
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
wood
and
charcoal
the
taste
is
a
nice
roasted
caramel
malt
that
reminds
me
of
a
mocha
hints
of
burnt
wood
and
bittersweet
chocolate
linger
in
the
end
not
super
big
on
flavor
but
in
perfect
balance
the
feel
is
moderate
with
soft
carbonation
leading
to
a
nice
silky
feel
finishes
with
a
roasted
bitterness
and
slight
hop
spiciness
quite
an
easy
drinking
brew
considering
the
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
just
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
and
feel
this
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
plenty
of
character
and
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
this
my
second
review
of
this
beer
in
the
first
one
i
said
there
was
not
much
head
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
happened
there
but
i
got
a
lot
of
head
when
this
one
poured
out
must
be
because
the
bartender
did
it
maybe
beers
on
tap
are
better
than
from
the
bottle
it
still
has
that
delicious
hersheys
special
dark
flavor
and
its
still
creamy
and
smooth
with
little
carbonation
for
some
reason
i
like
it
a
little
bit
better
this
time
perhaps
its
because
its
only
my
second
beer
of
the
day
and
i
can
judge
it
better
or
something
i
like
it
very
bood
beer
too
understated
and
unremarkable
for
my
tastes
this
beer
is
decent
there
are
not
too
many
schwarzbiers
to
choose
from
that
are
widely
available
but
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
probably
would
not
buy
a
whole
sixer
of
these
but
it
was
nice
to
try
a
couple
and
certainly
would
not
turn
one
down
if
offered
drinkability
went
in
with
low
expectations
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
i
will
likely
purchase
more
than
once
again
d
a
good
solid
beer
id
have
it
again
and
i
probably
will
buy
it
but
its
not
an
everyday
type
of
thing
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
drink
before
908
date
into
a
pint
glass
the
pour
is
moderate
that
resulted
in
a
12
beige
head
that
fades
kinda
fast
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
dominate
the
nose
coffee
and
chocolate
are
the
initial
tastes
finishes
a
bit
sweet
could
use
more
bittering
and
a
drier
finish
good
tastes
but
sweetness
lowers
the
drinkability
but
still
good
enough
for
a
couple
d
great
cheap
beer
to
share
with
friends
this
is
one
of
my
everyday
beers
when
im
not
trying
something
new
its
good
for
any
occasion
its
not
special
just
good
this
beer
drinks
very
easy
love
this
beer
and
would
drink
many
more
id
buy
this
again
in
6pack
form
but
would
be
tentative
to
put
it
on
tap
recommended
scharzbier
im
in
the
part
of
this
site
and
tasting
beers
that
i
love
is
that
now
i
will
have
to
go
search
out
for
the
best
of
the
schwarzbiers
to
try
them
closing
this
brew
the
honey
porter
and
the
irish
red
are
in
the
current
brewmasters
6pack
and
all
three
are
tops
for
samuel
adams
beers
which
to
me
still
sets
the
standard
for
all
the
other
microbrewers
out
there
medium
bodied
and
dry
just
what
id
expect
for
the
style
that
is
essentially
the
lager
version
of
a
stout
very
clean
roasty
and
satisfying
a
very
solid
brew
and
a
great
style
i
wish
other
brewers
would
make
more
attempts
at
the
schwarzbier
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
ill
definitely
drink
it
again
oh
and
it
left
a
pretty
good
lacing
too
slick
with
a
tingle
of
carbonation
and
slightly
juicy
excellent
drinkability
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
mild
to
moderate
carbonation
a
great
beer
from
sa
i
just
wish
this
style
was
more
widely
produced
d
the
flavor
was
very
rich
drinkability
was
nice
moderate
by
flavor
an
easy
drink
a
good
beer
to
bridge
the
gap
overall
and
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
very
sessionable
this
pours
a
pale
black
color
from
the
bottle
and
presents
a
beige
head
the
nose
has
lots
of
burnt
and
toasted
malts
followed
by
a
quiet
caramel
presence
the
flavor
is
also
predominantly
roasted
malts
with
a
gentle
hop
bitterness
the
body
is
a
bit
too
light
and
fizzy
but
this
is
still
a
decent
black
lager
pours
almost
black
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
foamy
tan
headwith
very
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
of
chocolateand
honey
with
maybe
body
is
medium
with
some
carbontion
taste
is
of
dark
fruitsand
chocolate
hints
of
honey
through
outand
a
black
licorice
in
the
finish
really
good
d
a
good
drinkabale
beer
i
prefer
only
1
or
2
of
these
but
worth
a
try
a
great
addition
to
the
commercial
fleet
of
boston
brews
may
the
schwartz
be
with
you
d
very
drinkable
easily
my
favorite
sam
adams
has
some
complex
flavors
but
is
not
too
heavy
very
enjoyable
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
a
nice
offering
from
sam
adams
mf
d
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
mild
in
flavor
make
for
a
good
drinker
non
aggressive
taste
yet
still
an
obviously
americanized
brew
d
only
thing
that
makes
this
beer
less
drinkable
is
the
rich
flavors
of
the
malts
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
dont
usually
drink
dark
lagers
or
stouts
this
beers
smell
and
taste
are
a
nice
balance
of
beery
goodness
that
delights
my
palate
the
roasted
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
give
this
beer
a
stout
like
taste
with
medium
consistancy
of
a
lager
despite
the
interesting
taste
i
still
think
some
complexity
could
be
added
to
this
beer
i
think
samuel
adams
brewers
should
try
emulating
rogue
brewery
beers
which
are
complex
but
very
drinkable
overall
i
think
this
is
a
fine
beer
both
in
taste
and
going
down
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
drawback
d
a
light
bodied
beer
with
nice
complexity
definitely
good
sessionability
i
must
say
im
impressed
with
this
one
i
came
in
expecting
less
and
got
more
this
beer
is
a
guinness
wannabe
i
think
its
a
good
beer
and
id
drink
it
again
but
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
guinness
i
would
probably
just
drink
a
guinness
and
leave
this
one
for
the
less
sagacious
of
beer
drinkers
i
e
those
who
are
not
attending
the
tap
festival
at
hunter
mountain
this
weekend
this
is
probably
the
beer
that
got
me
into
sam
adams
again
in
fact
having
this
one
in
vegas
right
before
my
first
poker
tournament
to
calm
the
nerves
is
what
inspired
me
to
get
the
variety
pack
and
try
some
others
such
as
the
scotch
ale
brown
ale
and
boston
lager
this
one
was
my
favorite
d
a
good
solid
beer
this
one
is
one
of
sa
better
beers
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
terribly
refreshing
but
this
would
be
nice
in
fall
or
spring
d
a
good
representation
of
a
oft
overlooked
style
if
youre
a
shwarzbier
fan
go
for
it
the
bottle
claims
a
medium
mouthfeel
but
i
would
say
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
a
solid
offering
but
pales
in
comparison
to
the
other
sa
brewmaster
beers
do
a
great
session
beer
whose
style
is
often
forgotten
about
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
sam
adams
and
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
these
cheers
d
definitely
drinkable
if
you
are
looking
for
something
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
this
might
not
be
it
however
a
nice
beer
to
go
with
dinner
tmd
this
is
a
very
smooth
drink
not
too
much
of
a
bitter
taste
is
noted
i
will
be
enjoying
this
one
with
its
5
friends
d
with
such
a
light
body
this
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
the
taste
is
decent
and
the
beer
isnt
too
filling
probably
the
most
sessionable
dark
beer
ive
had
drinkability
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
mostly
clean
and
light
alcoho
d
this
is
a
decent
quaffing
beer
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
not
sure
id
use
it
for
much
else
though
i
drank
this
one
down
pretty
quickly
but
it
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
i
think
i
would
just
like
more
presence
from
all
of
the
flavors
involved
i
enjoyed
them
very
much
so
give
me
more
best
by
july
notched
on
the
bottle
served
in
my
sa
sensory
pint
glass
poured
dark
brown
almost
black
some
redbrown
highlights
when
backlit
twoinch
light
tan
head
stretched
from
the
stripe
surrounding
the
glass
up
to
the
lip
and
slightly
over
the
top
head
was
almost
guinnessesque
out
of
the
bottle
finally
settling
into
a
thin
consistent
layer
of
foam
fair
amount
of
lacing
with
decent
adhesion
scents
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
not
overpowering
but
nicely
balanced
taste
similar
to
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
subtle
chocolate
character
and
a
mildly
bitter
hops
presence
at
the
finish
lightly
carbonated
and
also
somewhat
silkymilky
at
the
same
time
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
and
find
it
extremely
sessionable
light
bodied
with
presence
md
slightly
bitter
leaves
a
slimy
film
in
the
mouth
but
is
drinkable
like
a
good
sam
adams
brew
the
nice
thing
was
that
it
was
on
sale
for
only
12
50
a
12
pack
and
at
that
price
it
maintains
some
good
value
at
its
usual
price
of
15
99
a
six
pack
its
value
is
far
less
it
is
smooth
and
engaging
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
is
very
good
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
that
goes
down
extremely
easy
i
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
highly
recommended
usually
im
not
a
fan
of
super
malty
flavored
beers
but
the
roasted
smokiness
of
the
malts
in
this
beer
put
it
right
up
my
alley
beer
looks
good
smells
good
and
tastes
good
not
great
but
good
feels
great
in
the
mouth
a
very
comfortable
beer
definitely
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
from
time
to
time
drinkability
its
very
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
and
appetizing
a
delicious
beer
that
is
light
enough
to
enjoy

black
lager
pours
a
very
very
dark
brown
which
is
actually
a
deep
dark
red
when
held
to
a
bright
light
a
nice
twofinger
tan
head
forms
but
slowly
settles
the
beer
smells
of
roasted
coffee
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
the
taste
starts
with
some
sweet
chocolate
followed
by
some
roasted
coffee
notes
a
slight
bitterness
shows
up
about
five
second
after
the
swallow
the
mouthfeel
starts
very
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
followed
by
a
pop
of

a
unique

in

to

traditional
lager
with
a
huge
malt
flavor
and
thick
on
the
roasted

notes
big
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
influence
not
much
for
hops
in
this
one
just
a
touch
to
spice
it
up
a
touch
drinks
easy
although
its
robust
character
and
complex
flavors
might
hold
you
down
to
a
couple
or
three
not
a
traditional
swilling
lager
d
i
love
this
beer
it
is
very
complex
for
a
lager
highly
recommend
this
and
is
relatively
easy
to
find
now

all
and
all
this

be

this
is
almost
cloying
on
the

and
sourness
d
i
can
nurse
about
four
a

no

very
good

enjoyable
beer
if
just
a
tad
on
the
bitter
side
good
representation
of
the
style
and
quite
the
easy
drinker
as
well
not
particularly
impressive
taste
is
rather
creamy
taste
is
mostly
contributed
by
the
roasted
malt
with
some
coffee
bitterness
contributing
some
spice
and
even
a
little
hop
presence
to
balance
things
out
a
little
bit
not
overly
sweet
but
just
right
on
a
cool
evening
or
sitting
indoors
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
good
stuff
not
a
bad
lager
okay
so
the
beer
pours
dark
maroon
the
head
is
not
that
stable
but
the
lacing
is
nice
smells
like
roasted
malt
and
spicy
hops
clean
lager
like
taste
is
pleasing
the
roasted
character
is
quite
well
incorporated
bitterness
is
mild
and
lets
the
malt
show
its
face
the
carbonation
lightens
the
brew
up
in
texture
a
bit
this
stuff
is
quite
drinkable
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
looks
very
similar
to
coke
a
small
head
which
died
in
a
minute
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
was
weak
but
i
detected
a
little
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
smell
as
for
taste
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
it
was
similar
to
the
smell
but
not
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
it
finishes
good
and
is
very
drinkable
a
good
example
of
a
similar
style
is
new
belgiums
1554
dark
in
color
yet
highly
drinkable
and
full
of
flavor
very
dark
amber
pour
light
carbonated
head
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
smell
smoky
maple
syrup
there
is
also
a
slight
artificially
sweet
smell
not
really
happy
with
the
nose
very
complicated
flavor
smoky
burnt
chocolate
and
a
little
fruity
good
mouthful
and
pretty
drinkable
fairly
decent
overall
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
i
could
enjoy
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
row
definitely
a
good
one
to
sit
and
enjoy
though
d
very
drinkable
fairly
light
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
too
quickly
drinking
a
six
pack
in
an
evening
isnt
a
challenge
black
with
amber
showing
around
bottom
of
glass
two
finger
fizzy
head
on
a
good
pour
sometimes
i
get
carried
away
with
agressive
pour
and
this
guy
goes
everywhere
head
reduces
to
ring
and
leaves
solid
lacing
of
small
almost
soda
like
bubbles
smell
is
solid
molasses
caramel
and
chocolate
are
represented
taste
is
good
chocolaty
and
malty
with
dry
finish
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
as
it
tastes
great
and
isnt
overly
filling
i
am
not
a
huge
schwarzbier
person
but
i
have
had
others
that
excited
me
more
than
this
one
this
one
was
very
average
appearance
black
with
hints
of
red
one
finger
tan
head
that
dissapeared
a
little
quick
smell
was
chocolate
and
malt
taste
was
much
the
same
with
very
little
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
light
to
mediem
body
and
mediem
carbonation
drinkability
i
supose
i
could
have
a
few
but
i
could
do
without
it
just
as
well
overall
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
a
nice
offering
from
sam
adams
dthis
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
good
pours
a
gorgeous
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
with
red
ruby
highlights
a
huge
head
is
formed
very
offwhite
near
tan
color
and
great
tracing
lots
of
caramel
sweet
malt
slight
bitter
chocolate
and
some
floral
hops
coffee
in
the
finish
a
mediumthin
mouthfeel
with
flavors
of
light
chocolate
slight
roastiness
but
not
bitter
overall
it
is
very
smooth
a
light
drinker
with
lots
of
flavor
and
extremely
clean
a
moderate
amount
of
hallertau
hops
without
any
bitterness
but
a
balanced
finish
theres
also
an
interesting
cola
like
flavor
in
the
middle
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
nice
style
will
try
again
drinkability
perfectly
fine
schwartzbier
in
fact
its
rather
good
and
quenching
for
sure
not
the
best
but
certainly
worth
trying
ill
be
having
another
sometime
down
the
line
a
little
less
drinkable
than
better
black
lagers
ive
tried
again
a
little
heavy
for
the
flavor
profile
solid
commercial
effort
thick
but
watery
has
a
bit
of
staying
power
enjoyable
though
not
incredible
highly
drinkable
d
very
good
if
i
saw
12
packs
of
this
id
definitely
indulge
this
brew
singlehandedly
changed
my
opinion
of
this
brewery
i
must
admit
the
cherry
wheat
turned
me
off
to
them
but
that
was
silly
i
know
more
of
a
subconscious
notion
perhaps
but
now
that
its
all
behind
us
ill
be
looking
out
for
more
of
their
stuff
d
while
subdued
compared
to
other
black
lagers
the
coffeelike
finish
makes
it
a
bit
less
drinkable
had
before
in
the
mixed
case
tried
here
after
several
packaged
all
by
itslelf
pours
black
with
some
browns
that
come
out
in
the
sunlight
thick
white
tan
head
has
decent
lacing
and
retention
toasted
malty
nose
flavors
of
cocoa
molasses
and
cola
come
along
rather
smoothly
mouthfeel
started
off
creamy
yet
finished
rather
dry
pretty
drinkable
brew
that
reminded
me
of
the
better
brews
in
the
czech
republic
d
easy
to
drink
and
at
just
under
5
abv
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
to
enjoy
more
than
one
of
d
very
drinkable
great
version
of
a
schwarzbier
good
effort
by
sam
adams
recommended
d
i
could
drink
two
or
three
of
these
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
transition
beer
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
d
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
its
not
spectaculare
but
its
very
enjoyable
despite
the
color
my
experience
has
shown
the
style
to
not
be
a
good
deal
heavier
than
its
lighter
german
counterparts
this
on
the
other
hand
is
a
touch
thicker
still
the
carbonation
is
just
fine
and
the
overall
drinkability
is
exceptional
its
a
good
thing
i
cant
find
this
in
anything
other
than
the
brewmasters
sampler
because
id
drink
far
too
much
of
this
stands
alongside
the
oktoberfest
as
sas
best
beer
in
my
estimation
d
a
very
good
beer
a
nice
bridge
between
a
crisp
lager
and
a
strong
stout
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
especially
since
this
is
readily
available
in
a
6
pack
drinkability
is
fairly
good
for
a
dark
beer
if
you
get
the
chance
try
eaten
a
roasted
malt
before
drinking
this
beer
it
really
brings
out
the
burnt
flavor
and
enhances
the
beer
i
liked
this
one
alot
ive
only
had
a
few
of
this
style
but
bbc
has
done
a
very
good
job
on
creating
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
beer
hop
heads
will
be
disappointed
but
this
is
a
black
for
the
masses
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
good
job
bbc
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
although
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
beer
or
even
the
first
sam
adams
i
would
go
for
if
i
were
out
note
i
plan
on
retasting
again
because
while
doing
this
test
i
think
i
might
be
feeling
a
cold
coming
on
and
i
would
like
to
retest
to
make
sure
i
didnt
miss
sense
or
taste
anything
pours
what
seems
like
a
cola
color
but
held
to
light
is
more
ruby
red
but
not
copperish
poured
a
mountainous
head
that
didnt
die
down
to
some
heavy
carbonation
there
is
a
malt
presence
perhaps
you
can
pick
up
some
smoke
in
the
smell
but
theres
no
defining
smell
the
taste
picks
up
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
more
of
the
later
because
there
isnt
a
drying
sharp
afterbite
at
all
the
label
says
caramel
and
i
didnt
really
taste
it
but
that
coupled
with
the
less
hops
could
be
why
it
is
a
very
smooth
slippery
beer
almost
like
a
stoutlight
to
bastardize
it
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
have
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
is
alot
lighter
and
smoother
than
i
expected
it
to
be
making
it
a
bit
more
sessionable
brew
than
a
stout
it
wouldnt
be
uncommon
to
be
able
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
i
think
i
like
schwarzbier
this
is
the
second
one
ive
had
and
its
really
pretty
good
because
of
its
mildness
and
hint
of
sweetness
i
think
this
would
be
pretty
good
with
spicy
or
heavily
seasoned
food
and
contrary
to
its
dark
heavy
look
this
really
doesnt
have
a
very
heavy
taste
good
stuff
d
this
is
easy
drinking
but
something
that
i
would
enjoy
one
or
two
of
evry
now
and
then
not
something
i
would
have
for
a
session
its
nicely
carbonated
standing
well
during
a
sporting
event
and
allowing
the
flavors
to
work
their
magic
its
quite
good
and
is
a
slightly
smoother
version
of
sprechers
excellent
black
bavarian
grab
it
and
thank
yourself
later
overall
i
really
love
this
beer
probably
my
favorite
from
sam
adams
black
but
clear
i
e
not
cloudy
this
brew
greets
you
with
a
nose
of
sweet
and
worcestershire
sauce
the
flavors
reveal
tar
and
syrup
with
perhaps
fewer
hops
than
id
hope
for
its
also
kinda
spritzy
the
finish
is
ok
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
not
bad
but
too
sweet
and
chocolately
for
my
liking
d
a
little
on
the
heavier
side
a
tasty
enough
beer
but
i
might
find
myself
taking
it
pretty
easy
on
this
one
when
all
is
said
and
done
medium
bodied
and
featuring
a
pretty
high
carbonation
level
i
repeatedly
swirled
much
of
this
out
until
the
beer
was
more
satisfactory
id
have
it
again
quite
refreshing
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
good
session
beer
on
a
cold
night
for
sure
i
like
the
flavor
and
want
to
drink
more
this
was
a
very
pleasant
lager
the
yeast
gave
it
a
smooth
taste
and
the
choice
and
amount
of
malt
used
were
appropriate
to
keeping
this
as
a
drinkable
lager
i
felt
it
was
very
soft
and
very
drinkable
at
a
modest
price
it
should
be
tried
by
anyone
who
has
access
to
it
a
very
pleasant
surprise
from
sa
i
was
not
expecting
this
to
have
nearly
the
complexity
that
it
does
it
pours
a
very
ruby
dark
color
although
clear
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
tannish
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
little
while
and
does
lace
the
smell
is
molasses
caramel
burnt
malts
some
chocolate
and
some
toffee
this
is
a
medium
bodied
moderately
carbonated
lager
with
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
taste
this
is
a
rather
chewy
beer
with
lots
of
character
im
tasting
some
sweet
malts
toasted
bready
grains
caramel
but
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
some
cocoa
hints
maybe
a
tad
bit
of
heavy
fruit
of
the
prune
or
fig
variety
there
is
some
lingering
aftertaste
that
is
a
tad
bit
sourish
tart
and
not
too
terribly
pleasing
but
aside
from
that
one
weakness
which
diminishes
its
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
yet
another
impressive
selection
from
sam
adams
i
had
to
wait
a
while
for
my
local
beer
store
to
get
this
in
because
it
seems
to
sell
out
as
soon
as
it
hits
the
shelves
around
here
it
was
worth
the
wait
dmaybe
one
of
my
favorites
from
sa
very
refreshing
beer
nice
switch
in
the
winter
from
heavy
ales
d
very
drinkable
a
tasty
black
lager
overall
its
a
decent
six
pack
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
ive
had
it
does
the
job
its
been
asked
this
is
another
let
down
for
me
with
the
brewmasters
collection
i
remember
liking
this
beer
a
few
years
back
i
guess
my
palate
has
changed
i
dont
think
i
will
try
this
again
its
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
probably
drink
again
its
a
little
heavier
than
i
was
expecting
in
all
areas
but
in
and
of
itself
great
great
flavor
and
aroma
pours
a
nice
dark
caramel
color
not
quite
black
head
is
thin
lacing
ok
smell
has
chestnuts
and
sweet
malt
with
pepper
and
chicory
in
background
taste
has
a
nice
toasted
malt
which
is
slightly
sweet
finish
is
smooth
with
a
little
roasted
pepper
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
good
with
enough
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
this
beer
just
sits
well
with
me
i
could
drink
one
after
the
other
if
i
didnt
have
to
be
anywhere
the
next
day
pours
a
very
dark
color
like
color
with
a
dark
colored
head
smell
is
kinda
weak
some
obvious
strong
malt
character
also
some
chocolate
and
toffee
scents
run
through
as
well
taste
is
really
enjoyable
it
has
a
wonderful
creaminess
to
it
especially
the
head
almost
like
vanilla
ice
cream
the
thick
mouth
feel
is
accompanied
buy
a
rich
maltiness
very
good
beer
possibly
my
fave
from
sam
adams
i
had
this
ages
ago
when
i
first
got
away
from
bmc
and
i
remember
hating
this
now
conversely
as
ive
opened
my
beer
horizons
i
really
enjoy
it
it
s
a
good
beer
for
sure
pours
a
dark
brown
rather
than
black
color
as
the
name
would
suggest
small
head
but
after
it
diminishes
it
does
hang
around
pretty
well
the
smell
is
raosted
nuttiness
hazelnuts
chestnuts
and
lots
of
other
good
ones
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
robust
barley
and
malt
flavor
up
front
followed
by
the
nutty
elements
on
the
finish
this
is
an
excellent
and
extremely
drinkable
beer
i
guess
i
am
fairly
new
to
trying
this
style
i
like
it
a
lot
good
drinkability
as
the
abv
isnt
too
high
and
its
not
too
filling
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
i
enjoyed
this
beer
today
in
a
pint
glass
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
from
the
brewmasters
collection
mix
pack
it
looked
delicious
and
dark
with
a
robust
white
head
the
malts
were
apparent
in
the
nose
and
there
was
a
hint
of
rich
fruit
as
well
the
taste
is
the
star
of
the
show
is
this
brew
the
people
i
tried
it
with
all
recognized
the
uncommonly
long
blooming
finish
that
this
beer
has
the
beer
is
extraordinarily
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
to
drink
im
usually
not
quite
this
enthusiastic
about
sam
adams
brews
but
the
people
at
the
boston
beer
co
have
a
real
winner
with
this
lager
d
nice
sweet
taste
with
roasted
notes
makes
in
an
overall
good
beer
and
easy
to
drink
silky
smooth
body
makes
it
easy
to
go
down
ill
drink
another
one
though
a
remarkably
smooth
and
very
well
made
black
lager
this
beer
has
an
enticing
chocolate
aroma
with
some
good
looks
too
the
color
is
a
very
very
dark
brown
this
beer
poured
with
an
incredible
amount
of
foam
that
slowly
settled
to
an
offwhite
rocky
head
and
then
later
a
collar
of
foam
the
chocolate
flavors
are
good
the
hop
bitterness
is
right
but
perhaps
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
thin
never
mind
because
this
very
dark
lager
is
so
smooth
and
i
can
overlook
the
almost
watery
body
the
finish
is
very
pleasant
with
an
almost
molasseslike
character
that
briefly
show
up
beforehand
a
very
delicious
and
very
drinkable
dark
lager
ive
been
eyeing
this
stuff
for
some
time
never
wanting
to
commit
to
a
6pack
sight
unseen
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
buy
a
single
bottle
as
part
of
a
mixyouown
6pack
so
here
i
am
trying
it
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
malts
not
quite
burnt
the
flavor
was
pretty
good
a
little
chocolate
and
roasted
sweet
malts
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
of
each
drink
very
good
schwarzbier
at
least
comparable
to
the
very
few
others
ive
had
pours
a
dark
blackish
red
if
that
makes
sense
the
appearance
is
the
best
thing
about
it
im
not
overly
familiar
with
the
schwarzbier
formula
but
there
should
be
going
on
here
than
a
deep
malt
taste
right
theres
no
roasting
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
fruits
chocolate
etc
just
malts
its
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
special
pours
a
very
dark
red
color
with
a
thin
lace
of
head
smell
is
very
malty
and
a
little
sweet
and
fruity
goes
down
very
smooth
and
is
lightly
carbonated
taste
is
malty
and
dank
with
a
little
bitterness
to
it
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
this
one
but
its
an
above
average
beer
only
schwarzbier
ive
had
but
i
give
it
a
thumbs
up
d
notes
i
cant
believe
its
taken
me
170
beers
to
review
a
sam
adams
offering
highly
drinkable
meets
all
the
flavor
characteristics
of
a
schwarz
refreshing
i
am
not
a
sa
cheerleader
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
this
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
cheers
overall
a
good
beer
a
rare
style
nice
to
see
it
would
purchase
again
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
the
sa
honey
porter
i
was
just
drinking
my
first
schwarzbier
so
i
cant
compare
with
others
of
the
type
this
is
a
great
drinkable
beer
it
is
submitted
for
style
as
a
schwarzbier
but
that
is
not
what
i
would
categorize
it
as
has
a
great
dark
head
that
did
not
dissipate
a
little
overcarbonated
smooth
taste
with
a
nice
malt
profile
that
does
not
overwhelm
the
hops
are
perfectly
balanced
in
the
background
with
little
to
no
hop
flavor
or
aroma
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
nice
schwarzbier
from
a
macro
company
that
continues
to
surprise
us
i
would
recommend
new
belgiums
1554
over
this
one
but
if
you
see
it
pick
it
up
for
the
hell
of
it
for
the
price
its
a
great
buy
comparitively
d
this
is
a
very
good
dark
beer
very
sessionable
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
sam
adams
this
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
almost
ruby
red
color
with
a
nice
head
that
lingers
for
a
few
minutes
and
does
leave
some
lacing
its
got
a
dark
malty
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
to
it
that
doesnt
try
to
do
to
much
its
very
drinkable
a
nice
cool
weather
beer
that
i
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
very
nice
beer
would
be
a
good
choice
for
a
flavorful
session
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
tastes
similar
to
sa
honey
porter
just
lacking
the
sweet
honey
aftertastes
the
aftertaste
is
strong
and
the
roasted
malts
just
linger
on
my
tastebuds
really
a
nice
beer
and
i
am
glad
that
samuel
adams
decided
to
make
this
beer
love
dark
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
brews
it
has
a
deep
sort
of
coffee
roasted
flavor
i
think
if
you
like
strong
stouts
or
porters
and
like
a
good
lager
you
will
like
this
my
favorite
out
of
the
6
pack
with
brown
ale
honey
porter
and
black
lager
definately
worth
a
try
and
a
good
beer
thats
easy
to
find
mouthfeel
is
is
medium
bodied
slightly
spiced
with
a
dry
finish
d
never
had
this
style
before
all
in
all
a
very
interesting
beer
the
style
description
says
looking
for
a
lighter
beer
but
one
with
depth
of
colour
and
taste
i
think
that
sums
it
up
this
is
a
lighter
beer
that
has
more
going
on
than
a
bmc
but
wont
kill
you
with
alcohol
definitely
worth
trying
d
fairly
drinkable
good
with
meals
mostly
worth
having
around
but
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
two
or
three
d
not
bad
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
and
may
buy
again
in
a
variety
pack
i
would
not
go
out
and
search
for
a
six
pack
of
it
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
my
favorite
cold
weather
lager
i
have
fond
memories
of
drinking
this
brew
while
it
snowed
outside
my
window
of
course
that
was
before
i
moved
waaay
south
d
easily
drinkable
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
or
complexity
it
is
quite
clean
however
and
overall
it
is
a
decent
example
of
a
black
lager
not
too
bad
nothing
too
complex
but
good
over
all
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
not
a
big
beer
but
has
the
flavors
of
the
heavier
brews
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
all
come
through
to
make
for
a
satisfying
experience
it
might
be
a
little
overcarbonated
but
i
didnt
mind
this
would
make
a
good
introductory
to
people
for
a
wider
beer
perspective
being
sam
adams
it
should
be
available
just
about
everywhere
also
is
it
just
me
or
does
the
name
black
lager
seem
unappealing
i
think
that
is
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
give
this
beer
a
taste
i
drank
this
one
down
pretty
quickly
but
it
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
i
think
i
would
just
like
more
presence
from
all
of
the
flavors
involved
i
enjoyed
them
very
much
so
give
me
more
the
appearance
was
great
a
dark
roasty
pour
made
me
anxious
to
try
it
the
smell
however
was
a
bit
weak
the
basic
ingredients
could
be
smelled
chocolate
caramel
and
sweet
spice
but
i
really
wanted
something
strong
to
smell
and
this
drink
lacked
that
kind
of
punch
however
the
taste
was
amazing
not
heavy
at
all
and
yet
all
those
typically
thick
ingredients
were
apparent
because
of
its
relative
lightness
this
is
definitely
a
drink
many
people
could
enjoy
especially
with
its
flavors
that
are
often
found
in
heavier
drinks
drinkability
a
solid
brew
a
little
heavy
but
a
couple
would
be
no
problem
d
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
a
fine
schwarzbier
one
of
my
dads
favourites
a
very
unique
style
to
be
had
for
sure
another
from
the
sampler
2
pours
deep
rootbeer
brown
w
a
creamy
head
which
dissapates
quickly
good
lacing
very
malty
nose
w
a
baked
aroma
hop
aroma
does
come
through
w
a
poss
diacetyl
undertone
the
flavor
of
roasted
chocolate
malts
really
complement
the
sweetness
slight
hop
prescence
also
nice
rich
med
bodied
very
dextrinous
quite
drinkable
this
is
really
good
i
can
see
myself
knocking
back
quite
a
few
of
these
this
winter
not
as
thick
as
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
but
brewed
very
well
nonetheless
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
whitish
cream
head
the
scent
was
of
roasted
malt
and
kinda
smoky
the
mouth
feel
was
suprisingly
light
the
taste
was
coffeeish
with
a
caramel
hint
very
good
to
my
suprise
definatly
one
of
the
more
intriguing
beers
ive
had
wouldnt
mind
getting
more
of
this
for
future
drinking
pleasure
medium
body
with
a
dry
slightly
astringent
finish
the
carbonation
is
persistent
enough
that
even
at
the
end
of
my
glass
i
feel
the
tingle
on
my
tongue
a
very
drinkable
offering
from
koch
bbc
perhaps
my
favorite
of
their
beers
that
ive
tried
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
that
leaves
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
was
good
hints
of
coffee
taste
is
very
enjoyable
malts
stick
out
i
was
expecting
this
to
feel
heavier
than
it
is
good
body
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
easy
to
brink
beer
not
too
heavy
and
very
smooth
i
would
get
this
again
if
i
ever
see
it
at
the
store
again
12
oz
bottle
from
the
samuel
adams
mix
pack
wonderful
smell
of
roasted
caramel
and
coffee
but
not
very
powerful
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
in
my
opinion
the
taste
was
wonderful
roasted
caramel
coffee
very
smokey
flavors
but
not
overpowering
like
some
porters
and
stouts
a
perfect
break
from
those
stronger
drinks
but
still
getting
that
distinct
flavor
i
was
seriously
considering
giving
this
a
4
5
on
taste
but
might
hold
off
on
that
overall
delicious
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
from
sam
adams
now
but
not
sure
if
i
could
down
too
many
as
it
was
mediumbodied
and
the
flavors
remind
you
that
youre
getting
full
i
found
this
beer
in
the
brewmasters
collection
at
my
local
kroger
poured
into
a
chilled
lager
mug
the
first
thing
you
will
notice
is
how
dark
it
is
when
they
said
black
lager
they
meant
it
it
has
a
nice
creamy
head
it
drinks
very
smooth
that
should
be
expected
for
a
lager
really
this
brew
reminded
me
of
a
dunkel
i
brewed
in
my
basement
this
is
certainly
worth
picking
up
again
give
it
a
shot
before
beers
prices
go
through
the
roof
overall
this
is
built
for
drinking
dark
in
appearance
but
lighter
in
body
this
one
could
fool
you
d
a
lot
of
burnt
dry
flavor
which
makes
this
more
of
a
novelty
in
my
book
drinkability
this
beer
wasnt
bad
i
like
the
dark
beer
taste
without
the
heaviness
very
smooth
for
as
dark
as
it
was
i
was
really
surprised
im
not
a
hophead
so
this
was
my
favorite
in
the
brewmasters
collection
case
hardly
any
hops
to
speak
of
and
such
a
smoothness
even
in
the
finish
very
nice
smooth
slightly
creamy
yet
thin
enough
to
drink
a
few
highly
recommended
by
me
remember
though
one
must
not
be
in
love
with
the
hop
flower
to
appreciate
this
malty
lager
cheers
and
saaalute
my
ba
friends
overall
a
very
good
schwarzbier
as
good
as
any
german
versions
ive
tried
recommended
rather
tasty
and
enjoyable
pours
with
a
one
finger
head
looks
more
dark
brown
then
black
with
a
small
hop
smell
not
very
malty
or
hoppy
but
first
you
taste
the
hops
then
you
taste
a
wide
sweet
malt
not
a
terribly
complex
beer
but
good
and
a
potent
potable
if
you
like
the
style
then
get
a
sixer
could
not
drink
a
lot
of
these
heavy
for
style
of
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
one
finger
head
aroma
is
smooth
and
malty
with
roasted
characteristics
that
are
reminiscent
of
a
porter
taste
is
very
smooth
and
roasty
flavorful
and
yet
finishes
clean
just
like
a
lager
im
loving
the
aftertaste
here
a
second
sip
confirms
more
of
the
same
mmm
so
smooth
roasty
and
very
much
like
a
lager
as
the
style
dictates
i
love
this
beer
one
of
sam
adams
better
efforts
drinkability
is
great
wish
the
bottled
version
was
so
rich
this
is
definitely
for
the
ontap
version
distinctly
superior
to
the
bottled
version
last
sampled
a
year
ago
beer
compares
very
favorably
against
german
and
czech
import
schwarzbiers
d
lowish
abv
and
full
of
flavour
but
not
too
full
on
if
it
was
more
readily
available
here
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
drinking
line
up
overall
i
am
still
not
really
sure
what
a
black
lager
is
supposed
to
be
other
then
a
light
porter
which
is
really
what
i
reviewed
this
based
off
of
i
thought
it
was
a
more
then
decent
light
porter
and
in
facr
quite
drinkable
worthy
of
being
in
the
brewmaster
selection
sure
this
was
really
pretty
good
my
only
thing
i
would
have
liked
to
see
would
have
it
be
a
little
thicker
other
then
that
i
thought
it
was
quite
good
and
would
defiantly
try
one
again
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
hint
of
amber
red
it
had
a
heavy
head
that
settled
into
a
nice
lacing
it
had
a
roasted
dark
chocolate
smell
with
a
little
bit
of
a
malt
quality
the
taste
is
roasted
and
smoky
with
sweet
malt
back
it
has
a
very
creamy
feel
but
a
light
finish
and
not
too
much
bite
its
a
subtle
beer
with
a
rich
flavor
and
a
light
body
if
you
like
dark
beers
this
is
an
easy
one
to
drink
but
it
lacks
the
heaviness
that
you
may
be
looking
for
sam
adams
never
disappoints
and
this
beer
is
certainly
worth
a
try
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
brews
it
has
a
wonderful
black
appearance
that
allows
just
enough
light
to
shine
through
when
you
hold
it
up
to
give
it
a
little
shine
a
very
nice
earthy
rich
coffee
scent
to
it
it
goes
down
very
smooth
with
a
wonderful
rich
dark
coffeelike
flavor
definitely
worth
a
try
or
a
sixpack
if
you
like
dark
lagers
loved
everything
about
this
beer
dnot
very
drinkable
i
dont
like
heavy
thick
beers
i
like
a
lot
of
flavor
e
g
a
vienna
or
an
ipa
but
i
dont
like
a
heavy
beer
that
drags
you
down
to
date
sam
bl
is
my
favorite
daily
drinker
so
this
one
was
a
let
down
got
it
in
a
seasonal
sampler
notes
this
beer
is
upfront
its
not
like
the
west
coast
craft
beers
that
come
off
so
sweet
and
complex
this
is
for
people
that
like
their
coffee
black
its
all
coffee
basically
i
like
this
beer
with
sweet
barbecue
the
sweetness
from
the
sauce
adds
sugars
to
it
and
brings
out
more
candied
fruit
notes
a
nice
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
dark
reminds
me
of
a
porter
overall
good
brew
very
drinkable
sampled
from
12
oz
bottle
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
pack
pours
very
dark
almost
black
but
when
held
to
light
its
more
of
a
deep
cranberry
red
nice
2
finger
tan
head
intially
but
quickly
dissolves
leaving
a
thin
layer
behind
very
little
last
smell
is
off
coffee
and
chocolate
very
dark
smell
to
it
taste
is
pretty
good
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
dominate
the
flavor
but
there
seems
to
be
a
hint
of
hops
lower
carbonation
and
somewhat
creamy
taste
medium
mouthfeel
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
almost
got
better
as
temperature
increased
not
a
bad
offering
from
sam
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
has
good
solid
flavour
1008
md
much
lighter
than
expected
and
for
such
a
dark
beer
a
bit
watery
interesting
flavors
and
i
can
see
why
some
might
love
it
but
not
quite
my
thing
i
do
imagine
that
i
will
drink
another
one
or
two
this
winter
though
as
you
would
expect
from
a
beer
called
black
lager
this
nice
looking
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
or
garnet
with
a
medium
head
with
great
retention
aroma
is
malty
milk
chocolate
and
light
molasses
despite
being
as
dark
as
a
stout
the
taste
is
light
and
chocolaty
with
a
smoked
characteristic
not
much
of
an
appearance
by
the
hops
but
that
is
to
be
expected
not
much
bitterness
but
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
like
a
lager
one
of
the
few
dark
beers
i
wouldnt
mind
having
on
a
hot
day
one
of
boston
beers
best
offerings
in
my
opinion
i
decent
brew
but
i
hope
that
sam
adams
can
give
it
a
little
more
balance
in
the
future
i
imagine
this
would
pair
well
with
some
hearty
grilled
fare
d
i
plan
on
stocking
some
in
the
fridge
for
the
next
couple
of
weeks
as
they
are
so
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
and
so
easy
to
drink
black
beer
with
a
finger
of
white
head
and
nice
lacing
looks
great
although
its
my
first
schwarzbier
so
it
might
just
be
average
for
the
style
im
giving
it
top
marks
anyway
nose
is
licorice
coffee
some
spices
light
sweet
malt
shows
up
too
taste
is
roasted
malt
up
front
almost
stoutlike
some
spiciness
its
good
although
not
particularly
complex
solid
hoppy
aftertaste
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
i
like
this
one
a
lot
seems
like
itd
be
a
really
good
session
beer
wow
what
a
tasty
beer
the
semisweet
chocolate
and
bitter
coffee
bean
flavor
really
come
through
and
the
sweet
caramel
malt
compliments
the
rich
flavors
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
somewhat
creamy
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
the
seldomused
schwarzbier
style
and
im
glad
to
see
sam
adams
made
such
an
excellent
version
of
one
recommended
highly
notes
deceptively
lighttasting
for
the
color
of
this
brew
with
the
opaque
blackness
i
was
expecting
something
very
filling
but
that
just
goes
to
show
how
things
do
not
always
meet
the
eye
especially
with
beers
at
4
9
this
is
a
great
and
surprisingly
sessionable
beer
if
you
love
the
roasted
and
deep
chocolate
flavors
in
beer
then
this
one
is
for
you
compare
to
a
stout
or
porter
d
this
black
lager
has
its
better
qualities
however
theres
something
about
this
beer
that
feels
like
its
holding
back
for
the
style
its
not
a
bad
representation
but
it
doesnt
deserve
an
excellent
rating
although
i
usually
steer
towards
ales
i
enjoyed
this
lager
very
much
poured
very
dark
brown
to
black
from
bottle
with
creamy
white
head
that
it
didnt
retain
very
long
rich
malty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
hops
i
think
the
boston
beer
company
is
underrated
as
they
make
a
great
variety
of
good
beers
as
they
have
become
available
nationwide
i
think
they
are
taken
for
granted
and
are
not
the
in
beer
like
the
regional
microbrews
opaque
and
sable
it
looks
like
a
porter
or
stout
aroma
is
stouty
and
inviting
strong
roast
smell
with
overtone
of
molasses
and
a
hint
of
salt
flavor
has
both
malt
and
hop
components
with
smoky
and
coffee
tones
and
just
a
whisper
of
sweetness
though
it
does
not
have
quite
the
nice
thick
feel
of
a
good
stout
or
porter
it
is
very
satisfying
and
enjoyable
very
different
from
any
lager
i
have
ever
tried
all
in
all
the
experience
of
drinking
this
from
the
new
glass
is
a
favorable
one
to
when
i
reviewed
this
1
12
years
ago
i
have
unjustly
ingnored
this
beer
in
the
past
along
with
the
style
granted
theres
not
a
lot
of
schwarzbiers
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
but
i
think
ill
be
getting
it
more
often
da
ooooh
yeah
this
beer
in
this
glass
is
pretty
satisfying
a
tasty
beer
probably
would
trade
some
of
its
sweetness
for
additional
dark
malt
but
its
to
style
and
quite
good
asis
thanks
d
not
bad
for
an
amero
black
themed
lager
errr
i
mean
schwarzbier
lol
a
fine
beer
which
is
great
for
all
occasions
the
smell
is
sweet
and
thick
with
no
off
tones
the
appearance
is
beautiful
although
the
head
thick
but
dissappointingly
short
lived
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
that
is
not
overpowering
i
highly
suggest
trying
this
beer
its
certainly
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
i
would
never
turn
it
down
for
the
money
and
the
style
another
great
sam
adams
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
got
a
nice
thick
tan
head
that
covered
a
dark
brown
almost
black
body
the
head
lasted
for
some
time
and
has
some
excellent
lacing
i
must
admit
that
on
this
beer
i
could
barely
smell
anything
just
a
few
malt
odors
and
a
mild
coffee
aroma
even
after
i
agitated
this
lager
in
the
cup
for
a
bit
i
could
only
make
out
these
two
faint
aromas
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
was
absolutely
great
it
is
very
sharp
and
crisp
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
slightly
bitter
afterwards
and
goes
down
with
a
semidry
bitter
aftertaste
and
it
has
a
sweet
undertone
overall
d
very
drinkable
balanced
drinkability
about
as
rousing
and
stirring
as
a
light
lager
can
get
not
a
bad
choice
but
if
youre
looking
for
more
complexity
in
this
mix
pack
id
select
the
honey
porter
overall
this
is
a
delicious
refreshing
and
reasonablypriced
brew
that
will
definitely
remain
in
regular
rotation
in
my
fridge
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
think
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
pours
a
not
quite
opaque
black
that
shows
some
dark
ruby
highlights
and
presents
a
decent
frothy
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
dark
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
good
blend
of
chocolate
and
dark
malts
against
a
decent
hop
backbone
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
with
decent
carbonation
even
on
a
warm
early
summer
night
this
beer
provides
all
the
refreshment
youd
expect
from
a
much
lighter
lager
overall
quite
a
tasty
brew
looking
at
sams
limited
releases
they
are
quite
nice
this
is
a
beer
that
ill
happily
drink
again
and
would
be
a
good
transitional
beer
for
those
that
are
afraid
of
those
dark
beers
recommended
d
overall
a
pretty
refreshing
and
quaffable
brew
just
not
that
big
on
taste
this
brew
is
very
well
balanced
the
roastiness
is
not
overdone
easily
accomplished
with
a
schwarzbier
and
the
caramel
and
malts
are
left
to
the
background
letting
the
roastiness
take
the
focus
cheers
to
sam
adams
youve
created
another
phenomenal
brew
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
is
reasonable
overall
very
smooth
with
a
nice
touch
of
roastiness
to
give
it
some
character
very
drinkable
would
have
it
again
and
would
also
consider
it
a
session
candidate
pours
from
the
bottle
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
subtle
burgundy
hues
faint
subdued
aromas
of
toasted
wheat
bread
and
malt
dark
caramels
molasses
and
chocolate
maintains
a
beautiful
thick
and
dense
tan
head
with
intricate
lacing
patterns
throughout
the
glass
palate
is
pleasantly
thick
full
and
creamy
flavor
profile
much
more
satisfying
and
assertive
as
comapered
to
the
aromas
nice
notes
of
dark
roasted
malts
burnt
caramel
candies
cocoa
with
a
faint
hint
of
molasseslike
sweetness
and
noble
hop
spiciness
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
and
a
solid
rendition
of
the
style
drinkability
is
also
good
if
you
like
your
beers
on
the
sweet
side
still
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
heft
and
a
good
choice
if
youre
looking
for
something
lighter
than
a
porter
a
few
months
after
this
review
i
got
some
more
of
this
no
changes
in
the
score
but
i
popped
the
top
of
one
that
had
in
sitting
in
my
trunk
for
a
week
in
other
words
i
consumed
it
at
room
temperature
it
was
pretty
tasty
and
the
intensity
of
the
flavor
is
greater
try
one
out
the
next
time
you
get
a
6pack
of
this
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
decent
head
and
very
spotty
lacing
the
nose
is
lightly
sweet
and
malty
followed
by
lightly
toasted
grain
the
taste
is
similar
nicely
balanced
maltiness
and
toasty
grain
but
relatively
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
rounded
and
creamy
even
though
there
is
a
little
sweetness
in
this
one
no
real
stickiness
nicely
done
and
a
very
nice
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
velvet
the
fine
carbonation
feels
really
good
on
the
tongue
d
quite
enjoyable
i
found
this
to
be
very
refreshing
and
dare
i
say
sessionable
drinkability
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
for
all
occasions
the
taste
was
not
quit
as
bad
as
the
smell
the
taste
had
a
sour
and
tart
feel
on
the
palate
it
was
not
a
pleasant
lager
flavor
the
sour
taste
of
the
roasted
malts
turned
me
off
goes
good
with
saurkraut
and
potatoes
german
cuisine
perhaps
with
desert
as
well
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
if
not
black
color
with
amber
highlights
the
smell
is
mild
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
rather
strong
of
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
a
porter
this
is
a
heavy
beer
as
one
might
expect
and
is
therefore
not
good
as
a
session
beer
an
easytodrink
crossover
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
but
this
is
a
much
thinner
pour
than
other
dark
beers
the
head
is
white
and
strong
a
bunch
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
surface
licorice
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
are
present
in
the
smell
which
is
good
but
none
are
dominant
nor
are
they
all
that
inviting
there
is
a
citrus
hoppy
sourness
that
is
immediately
evident
in
the
taste
which
is
then
followed
by
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
finishes
dry
mouthfeel
is
thin
not
that
this
is
bad
but
with
darker
beers
i
expect
more
creaminess
or
body
this
is
quite
thin
as
alternative
to
heavy
dark
beers
i
e
russian
imperial
stouts
this
is
a
great
thing
a
dark
beer
that
drinks
like
a
much
lighter
style
recommended
d
great
black
lager
from
a
large
brewery
nice
flavors
great
smell
little
too
sweet
and
the
hops
are
easy
to
miss
but
this
is
a
good
find
in
a
local
convenience
store
beer
truly
is
a
black
beer
it
had
no
distinctive
smell
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
taste
i
found
it
to
have
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
that
one
usually
sees
with
a
lager
it
had
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
where
it
would
be
considered
too
sweet
i
have
not
had
too
many
of
samuel
adams
beers
but
i
would
rate
this
as
my
favorite
i
would
be
able
to
have
several
of
these
to
pass
an
evening
i
would
order
another
samuel
adams
black
lager
this
is
a
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
with
its
watery
finish
id
really
like
to
give
this
a
try
from
a
tap
anyone
know
where
i
can
get
a
black
lager
on
tap
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
sam
adams
and
ive
had
virtually
all
of
their
non
limited
edition
beers
12
oz
bottle
color
of
dark
chocolate
with
a
decent
tan
head
nose
of
sweet
roasted
malts
some
bitter
sweet
chocolate
and
silky

taste
of
bitter
sweet
chocolate
malt
mild
bitterness
and
hint
of
espresso
body
is
light
silky
and
with
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
theres
hardly
any
carbonation
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
heavy
beer
not
bad
but
i
wont
be
rushing
back
for
another
good
flavor
solid
mouthfeel
and
low
abv
make
for
one
sessionable
beer
nicely
done
d
a
great
american
black
lager
sweet
supple
and
bready
flavors
make
for
a
brew
that
is
quaffable
delightful
sessionable
and
easy
to
enjoy
in
a
variety
of
settings
i
happened
to
enjoy
mine
with
a
cheesesteak
pizza
highly
recommend
trying
this
and
right
now
with
the
brewers
special
pack
you
get
to
try
several
different
styles
at
a
great
price
the
andersons
has
it
3
off
appearance
has
a
deep
dark
reddish
brown
having
a
off
white
healthy
head
smell
of
roasted
malts
slight
dry
fruits
but
not
much
else
taste
has
a
good
balance
between
the
malt
hops
and
carbonation
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
leaves
a
slight
bitter
and
dry
aftertaste
d
definitely
a
nice
beer
and
definitely
one
of
bbcs
best
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
recommended
im
not
in
love
with
the
black
lager
but
i
could
take
down
a
few
without
really
thinking
about
it
i
like
the
balanced
and
understated
profile
almost
like
a
light
version
of
some
porters
has
its
pros
and
cons
overall
its
okay
very
drinkable
when
cool
more
flavors
come
out
when
it
warms
slightly
pours
a
totally
opaque
black
that
betrays
only
the
slightest
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
direct
light
very
nice
aroma
of
roasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
and
some
dextrine
vanilla
notes
its
a
smooth
almost
creamy
aroma
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
big
and
juicy
with
plenty
of
active
carbonation
and
a
texture
that
treads
perfectly
between
creamy
smoothness
and
a
light
racy
touch
malt
bitterness
is
pronounced
up
front
before
morphing
into
something
a
thats
a
touch
sweeter
and
acidic
hop
snap
toward
the
end
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
sam
adams
its
got
rich
flavors
sessionability
and
authenticity
very
well
done
pours
almost
pitch
black
with
hints
of
red
kind
of
a
fizzy
looking
head
not
really
spectacular
the
smell
is
definitly
giving
off
some
fresh
chocolate
notes
slight
roasted
aroma
some
sweetness
the
taste
is
real
nice
mellow
on
the
roast
sweet
chocolate
decent
hop
balance
pretty
damn
drinkable
im
kind
of
suprised
real
nice
the
beer
poured
nice
smooth
into
the
glass
it
was
a
very
dark
colour
with
a
tan
two
finger
head
the
smell
was
a
warm
smokey
malt
taste
and
was
sweetesque
with
a
nice
caramel
under
tone
to
the
scent
the
taste
was
definiatly
above
average
it
started
very
rich
and
smokey
but
had
a
nice
sweet
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
satisfactory
not
too
heavy
but
definately
not
too
light
it
went
down
semi
smooth
drinkability
was
above
average
the
beer
pours
black
into
my
glass
with
an
offwhite
head
leaving
a
little
lacing
as
i
sip
the
aroma
is
moderately
roasted
a
little
sweet
and
there
is
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
mediumlow
sweetness
moderately
roasted
and
a
moderate
hoproast
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavor
that
hits
at
the
swallow
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
creamy
medium
body
and
carbonation
moderate
overall
this
is
one
the
best
offerings
by
sam
adams
the
nose
is
inviting
flavor
has
good
balance
but
still
leaves
you
with
a
little
something
after
the
swallow
the
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
body
mean
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
grab
a
6er
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
quite
easily
its
not
world
class
but
its
simply
a
well
made
beer
the
boston
beer
company
gets
flak
in
some
beer
circles
and
sure
they
arent
stone
or
bells
but
man
are
some
of
the
better
efforts
they
put
out
ever
drinkable
drinkabilty
very
good
no
matter
what
styles
of
beer
you
drink
like
somebody
else
said
this
is
a
good
a
comfort
type
of
brew
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
wonderful
dark
color
with
very
little
light
getting
through
nice
head
that
hangs
on
thru
sample
the
smell
of
the
roasted
malts
is
nice
with
a
slight
smoky
smell
behind
it
the
taste
is
more
towards
a
porter
imho
the
mouthfeel
is
even
not
too
heavy
and
certainly
not
light
the
roasted
coffee
and
caramel
taste
coats
the
mouth
and
lingers
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
would
get
it
again
d
if
your
into
darker
beers
then
i
highly
recommend
this
tasty
concoction
its
perfect
for
yearround
consumption
but
i
have
a
feeling
it
would
go
well
with
a
nice
summer
bbq
mmm
ribs
this
is
by
far
a
comfort
type
of
brew
d
overall
pretty
tasty
but
overly
carbonated
the
beer
poured
nice
and
dark
with
a
light
brown
head
but
the
head
was
thin
it
smelled
a
little
of
coffee
and
chocolate
it
tasted
of
coffee
as
well
but
was
not
a
strong
flavor
it
was
dry
as
a
schwarxbier
should
not
sweet
like
a
bavarian
dunkel
it
was
well
carbonated
as
well
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
anytime
except
for
hot
weather
mouthfeel
pretty
smooth
but
very
malty
since
its
think
i
probably
couldnt
drink
more
then
one
or
two
of
these
a
night
poured
into
a
nonic
with
sevral
pours
great
voluminous
head
on
this
mediumtan
in
color
and
with
nice
lacing
as
well
nose
is
pretty
much
onpar
for
the
style
which
is
a
very
good
thing
indeed
notes
of
toffee
caramel
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
molasses
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
touch
of
crimson
and
brilliant
carbonation
seems
rather
gentle
on
the
tongue
and
overallthis
seems
to
just
glide
effortlessly
across
the
palate
the
base
of
this
drinking
experience
is
provided
by
the
roasted
and
dark
malts
with
echoes
of
the
toffee
and
caramel
from
the
nose
along
with
a
lighter
taste
of
espresso
and
just
a
touch
of
light
biterness
yet
there
are
some
delicate
fruit
notes
as
well
light
notes
of
ripe
red
apples
and
sour
cherry
and
yes
its
also
a
touch
metallic
but
in
a
good
way
samuel
adams
black
lager
might
strike
some
as
light
or
thin
on
the
palate
but
its
on
style
and
moreover
is
far
less
a
big
beer
than
an
excellent
session
drink
i
look
forward
to
finding
this
on
draught
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
on
the
label
got
as
part
of
a
sampler
actually
the
3rd
time
i
got
this
in
a
sampler
and
its
the
1st
time
that
the
beer
wasnt
horrible
off
the
quality
of
sa
here
is
very
hit
or
miss
the
distributor
really
needs
to
step
it
up
anyway
was
a
black
color
with
dark
mahagony
highlights
the
smell
was
faint
but
had
dark
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
was
average
the
taste
was
just
alright
ive
really
gotten
in
this
style
this
year
and
have
had
several
and
this
was
in
the
bottom
third
mostly
bland
with
no
risk
taking
at
all
i
really
dont
get
the
sam
adams
hype
other
than
the
boston
lager
the
rest
of
just
average
at
best
overall
average
beer
that
is
not
worth
seeking
out
unless
you
find
in
a
friends
fridge
and
just
want
to
try
it

rb
t
o
bottle
courtesy
of
shp555
poured
a
deep
black
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
some
pretty
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
some
chocolate
notes
is
quite
good
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
chocolate
malt
and
some
roasted
slightly
bitter
malt
body
is
slightly
above
average
with
some
medium
to
low
carbonation
i
thought
this
was
nicely
done
and
fits
nicely
into
style
without
breaking
any
barrier
porued
into
my
yuengling
beer
glass
barely
had
any
head
which
quickly
disapated
first
tastes
were
what
i
was
expecting
hints
of
a
burnt
chocolate
taste
and
somewhat
nutty
flavor
very
enjoyable
mostly
into
stouts
and
this
was
a
pretty
good
alternative
as
its
lighter
on
the
stomach
definately
would
drink
again
overall
its
an
ok
schwarzbier
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
it
a
little
too
sweet
and
watery
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
tried
from
sam
adams
i
would
have
hoped
for
even
a
little
more
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
provide
balance
this
would
have
helped
round
things
out
and
increase
overall
drinkablility
as
it
stands
its
worth
a
try
drinkability
great
good
everyday
beer
great
session
beer
drank
a
12
oz
bottle
of
this
from
the
sam
adams
holiday
collection
has
a
bestby
may
2007
date
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
black
with
ruby
edges
thin
white
head
okay
retention
smells
of
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malts
hints
of
carrots
as
it
warmed
tastes
too
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
the
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
warming
alcohol
the
alcohol
comes
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
although
good
for
a
lager
overall
a
good
beer
i
liked
it
better
as
it
warmed
poured
deep
amberbrown
about
like
a
cola
nice
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
and
left
medium
lacing
aroma
is
very
nice
toasty
caramel
malt
a
lot
of
caramel
and
chocolate
in
the
taste
malty
rather
than
hoppy
a
nice
beer
and
somehow
more
honest
than
i
usually
find
mr
adams
offerings
to
be
d
a
bit
sweet
without
enough
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
but
note
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
beef
notes
a
nice
schwarzbier
here
but
i
wonder
if
it
fell
a
little
short
of
its
potential
this
schwartzbier
is
way
too
sweet
for
the
style
the
noble
bittering
hops
were
either
missing
or
in
such
small
quantities
that
the
taste
profile
suffered
this
is
a
disappointment
as
sa
usually
brews
some
very
nice
classic
beers
i
thought
this
would
be
a
porter
until
bringing
it
home
and
reading
what
a
schwarzbier
is
supposed
to
be
with
this
as
my
only
experience
i
can
see
this
is
a
style
to
search
out
the
color
was
a
reddish
black
with
a
thick
head
which
faded
quickly
the
smell
was
a
roasted
nutty
scent
however
the
highlight
was
the
taste
a
flavorful
and
balanced
beer
with
just
a
little
of
the
bitter
after
taste
ive
come
to
expect
from
my
porters
very
drinkable
and
one
i
would
seek
out
for
a
season
other
than
winterthis
is
being
typed
after
shoveling
the
latest
8
inches
of
snow
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
seemed
just
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
to
me
but
the
drinkability
was
very
good
with
the
light
body
and
relatively
low
alcohol
from
a
12
oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
a
brewmasters

lightly
toasted
tastes
faintly
sour
not
bitter
at
all
very
easy
to
drink
finishes
nicely
very
highly
reccomended
deffinetly
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
very
nice
indeed
most
beers
i
tried
in
this
or
similar
styles
often
suffer
some
from
a
little
bit
too
much
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
not
this
one
very
well
balanced
not
sure
if
its
according
to
style
but
very
good
drinkability
poured
a
dark
brown
color
almost
black
with
a
1
finger
tan
head
that
left
a
good
layer
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
was
very
malty
with
strong
hints
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
in
the
nose
some
spicy
hops
were
also
noted
in
the
aroma
taste
was
very
roasty
and
coffeeish
lots
of
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
was
fairly
light
for
a
such
a
tasty
beer
drinkability
was
good
and
the
relatively
low
abv
makes
this
highly
sessionable
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
schwarzbier
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
damn
good
another
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
black
go
figure
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
smell
is
sweet
with
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
the
taste
however
does
have
a
fair
amount
bitterness
to
it
as
well
as
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
taste
there
is
also
a
metallic
tinge
that
seems
to
be
fairly
prevalent
in
sa
products
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
has
bubbly
carbonation
and
leaves
a
feeling
of
dry
mouth
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
the
metallic
taste
ruins
it
for
me
very
dark
brown
with
a
mediumsized
tan
frothy
slowly
diminishing
head
and
attractive
lacing
smell
is
of
nutty
roasted
malts
a
large
dose
of
chocolate
and
some
light
hops
adding
balance
lots
of
deep
chocolate
malt
flavors
without
feeling
heavy
caramel
light
citrus
spice
and
some
earthy
yeast
it
has
a
medium
body
moderately
dry
texture
and
low
carbonation
this
is
supereasydrinking
while
still
having
the
nice
big
dark
beer
characteristics
solid
and
enjoyable
d
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
but
i
never
seem
to
be
able
to
do
so
probably
more
due
to
the
scotch
ale
in
the
mixed
packs
being
more
of
a
favorite
of
mine
a
good
initial
foray
into
darker
beers
for
the
neophyte
craft
beer
drinker
and
not
much
beyond
that
a
nice
creamy
head
during
the
pour
that
quickly
dissapears
a
fairly
high
level
of
carbonation
that
takes
away
from
the
potential
smoothness
of
the
beer
aroma
is
very
malty
and
nutty
similairly
nutty
flavor
to
the
beer
it
finishes
well
with
a
nice
bitterness
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
black
lagar
gave
a
1finger
light
tan
head
with
lots
of
big
airy
bubbles
color
was
a
very
deep
ruby
almost
black
the
head
faded
down
to
a
covering
within
a
minute
and
left
some
lacing
smell
was
of
light
roast
and
caramel
the
taste
of
this
beer
started
off
with
a
delicate
roastedness
with
caramel
sweetness
and
finished
with
a
slight
noble
hop
bitterness
it
was
mediumbodied
with
a
high
amount
of
prickly
carbonation
which
i
thought
was
a
little
distracting
this
is
a
nice
clean
tasting
dark
lager
that
highlights
some
light
roasted
flavors
and
is
easy
to
drink
a
good
alternative
to
some
big
thick
porters
and
stouts
if
something
lighter
is
desired
that
still
has
some
roast
in
it
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
average
head
spicy
aroma
with
dark
malts
evident
roasted
flavor
upfront
that
gives
in
to
the
sweet
malts
smooth
aftertaste
that
is
a
bit
watery
overall
effect
is
a
very
pleasant
mild
beer
very
sessionable
and
would
be
a
good
introduction
for
someone
just
getting
into
craft
beers
ok
for
those
occasional
jaunts
out
side
the
hop
limit
drinkability
after
years
of
drinking
this
beer
i
appreciate
it
more
and
more
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
order
it
if
other
options
are
available
for
platforming
i
dont
recommend
this
beer
just
because
of
the
unique
tastes
that
drown
out
the
classic
beer
tastes
a
pretty
good
black
lager
from
sam
adams
and
probably
one
of
the
best
black
lagers
i
have
had
out
of
a
bottle
d
enjoy
several
nice
earthiness
and
flavor
for
an
extremely
accessible
dark
beer
shouldnt
take
off
too
many
for
mouthfeel
as
this
is
a
dark
lagerswarz
and
theyre
not
typically
as
thick
or
chewy
as
stouts
more
like
a
old
age
porter
in
mouthfeel
this
also
has
some
of
that
old
age
porter
bitterness
which
i
absolutely
love
this
is
a
good
beer
for
something
you
can
get
at
the
grocer
for
8
298
99
a
six
will
revisit
often
intriguing
black
with
placid
head
notes
of
caramel
with
some
subdued
smoke
dark
chocolate
all
of
these
flavors
on
a
crisp
smooth
lager
canvas
lead
to
more
delicate
flavors
but
flavors
and
complexity
still
quite
notable
lacks
much
hop
presence
at
all
the
end
notes
get
a
little
sweet
and
could
use
a
little
ibu
power
to
subdue
them
a
good
nonoffensive
schwarzbier
that
i
wish
would
be
a
little
more
assertive
all
the
flavor
compacted
into
this
bottle
made
it
an
enjoyable
experience
but
one
that
left
me
with
a
bit
of
a
headache
if
this
is
right
up
your
alley
then
youll
have
to
go
out
buy
another
mix
pack
because
theres
only
two
bottles
in
here
drinkability
i
got
two
of
these
in
a
mixed
12
pack
i
would
gladly
buy
a
6pack
of
this
without
hesitation
with
an
abv
less
than
5
this
one
is
also
easily
sessionable
i
can
not
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
beers
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
someone
looking
for
something
new
the
black
lager
pours
its
namesake
color
with
some
dark
red
around
the
edges
with
a
tan
head
that
laces
as
the
the
beer
is
drunk
there
are
some
roasted
qualities
to
the
smell
otherwise
there
isnt
much
there
for
me
the
taste
has
some
nice
roastiness
to
it
and
perhaps
a
little
smoke
mouthfeel
is
better
than
average
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
you
wouldnt
do
yourself
wrong
to
try
this
one
tingly
smooth
feel
to
it
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
negra
modelo
id
be
less
likely
to
have
this
one
with
steak
fajitas
but
a
beautiful
brew
to
have
on
its
own
or
with
german
dishes

its
a
good
intro
to
the
style
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
in
the
future
id
get
this
beer
again
it
seems
like
a
beer
that
fits
a
certain
mood
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
new
years
day
dinner
not
amazing
but
not
a
disappointment
just
like
the
rest
from
sam
adams
while
its
nice
having
a
beer
or
twelve
on
sundays
while
watching
the
game
ive
come
upon
s
a
black
lager
it
has
tossed
me
back
in
my
lazyboy
a
few
times
big
in
flavor
heavy
in
smell
large
in
body
these
three
cryteria
are
very
important
on
any
given
sunday
smells
of
maltiness
and
chocolate
and
evokes
images
of
something
old
or
antique
has
a
very
thick
mouthfeel
but
without
too
much
cloying
that
usually
accompanies
such
a
thick

is
very
good

malts
peat

some

a

not

at

but
still
full

roasty
character
d
another
straight
forward
and
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
this
beer
wont
dazzle
you
but
its
really
hard
to
find
a
negative
aspect
to
this
one
not
enough
black
beers
on
the
market
imo
so
im
thankful
for
this
one
got
this
out
of
a
sample
pack
of
winter
sam
adams
the
last
black
lager
i
had
was
saranac
black
forest
lager
and
it
was
horrible
so
i
wasnt
expecting
much
turns
out
it
was
a
very
pleasant
tasting
beer
the
maltiness
and
roasted
taste
was
well
balanced
and
right
on
the
money
for
my
taste
it
was
almost
like
a
porter
but
not
and
chewy
and
sweet
very
nice
highly
drinkable
and
very
sessionable
a
great
repesentation
of
the
style
as
for
drinkability
i
would
definately
have
this
again
perhaps
ill
pick
up
a
sixer
or
three
and
share
at
my
next
household
gathering
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
tried
from
sam
adams
i
have
noticed
that
he
likes
to
have
one
particular
flavor
stand
out
in
the
beer
and
in
this
one
it
is
the
sweet
chocolate
i
really
wonder
if
this
is
the
base
beer
for
his
chocolate
bock
as
the
impression
is
very
similar
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
this
is
a
real
find
since
im
not
real
familiar
with
which
boston
beer
co
offerings
are
permenant
and
which
are
oneoffs
i
can
only
say
i
hope
they
keep
this
one
this
was
one
tasty
brew
the
color
is
as
you
might
expect
a
pretty
solid
black
the
head
wasnt
especially
substantial
compared
to
the
boston
lager
but
it
was
still
fair
sized
and
on
the
creamy
side
ive
always
liked
the
looks
of
black
beers
anyway
so
i
rate
the
appearance
of
this
one
pretty
high
smell
is
pleasant
dark
roasted
carmel
malt
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
and
alcohol
not
very
hoppy
taste
was
great
its
smooth
and
rich
with
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
with
some
coffee
in
the
background
again
hop
presence
is
not
strong
here
either
mouthfeel
was
also
pleasant
unlike
a
stout
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
same
reason
its
not
very
heavy
and
the
bitterness
doesnt
weigh
you
down
this
is
a
real
winner
here
sort
of
like
the
yuengling
porter
to
which
this
is
actually
quite
comparable
since
yuengling
uses
a
lager
yeast
for
that
beer
taken
up
a
notch
this
will
be
a
regular
so
for
me
so
long
as
the
boston
beer
co
is
kind
enough
to
keep
brewing
it
its
drinkable
but
not
out
of
this
world
woudl
definitely
have
one
again
this
is
on
my
favorites
list
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
memorable
a
slightly
unbalanced
schwarzbier
in
terms
of
flavor
sweetness
spiciness
and
robust
malt
richess
but
a
nice
effort
at
a
more
unusual
style
this
beer
poured
a
black
color
with
a
reddish
hue
the
head
was
thick
and
retention
was
good

as
was
the
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
sour
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
roasted
coffee
type
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
but
not
heavy
this
beer
is
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
it
comes
in
a
6
pack
but
i
bought
it
in
a
mixed
pack
very
high
drinkability
for
such
a
tasty
beer
not
a
great
beer
but
a
good
option
if
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
beer
and
still
want
some
taste
pours
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hint
with
a
good
head
with
great
retention
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
again
pretty
sweet
and
above
average
bitterness
id
say
the
taste
is
a
cross
between
23
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
13
cream
stout
very
drinkable
aftertaste
is
bittersweet
could
have
been
a
bit
more
hoppy
but
otherwise
a
great
beer
this
is
right
about
what
id
shoot
for
mouthfeelwise
in
this
style
a
full
mouth
enough
but
not
too
much
body
and
an
excellent
carbonation
rate
this
is
one
easy
drinking
brew
and
probably
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
creations
drinkabilityquite
nice
all
around
a
very
drinable
beer
d
easily
drinkable
but
i
wasnt
dying
for
another
after
i
finished
this
one
dark
maple
syrup
color
and
an
airy
tan
head
that
just
layers
the
top
big
malt
nose
with
notes
of
coffee
mild
fruits
and
roasted
malt
really
nice
taste
with
big
roasted
malt
characters
burnt
toffee
sweetness
smokey
notes
and
a
good
amount
of
hops
offer
up
some
floral
notes
and
a
little
bitter
bite
for
texture
the
finish
starts
out
hoppy
but
quickly
evolves
to
smokey
and
some
soft
fruit
notes
full
body
and
a
terrific
mouthfeel
with
carbonated
froth
surrounding
the
mouth
poured
dark
as
night
with
small
tan
head
that
laced
the
glass
smelled
of
coffee
with
some
creamy
scents
tasted
of
coffee
with
a
malty
flavor
espresso
like
aftertaste
not
much
carbonation
some
creamy
mouthfeel
goes
down
fairly
smooth
enjoyable
beer
sam
adams
makes
some
good
products
d
if
you
find
a
sixpack
of
this
i
wouldnt
hesitate
west
coasters
typically
need
to
look
harder
for
this
one
but
its
worth
it
color
is
comparable
to
a
very
dark
molassas
you
can
smell
a
strong
malt
along
with
a
roasty
caramel
carbonation
is
moderate
and
very
bubbly
head
is
a
tan
white
and
starts
out
strong
and
slowely
disspates
to
small
leaving
a
excellent
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
taste
goes
along
with
the
semll
strong
malt
with
a
very
roasty
caramel
flavor
goes
down
real
smooth
leaving
no
bitter
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
one
that
i
will
enjoy
for
a
long
time
i
will
make
this
one
of
the
beers
i
have
in
my
refer
to
enjoy
after
a
long
day
this
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
to
it
fairly
thin
in
appearance
when
held
up
to
the
light
smell
is
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
mollasses
taste
is
very
smooth
almost
creamy
well
balanced
and
refreshing
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
for
a
hop
head
like
me
overall
extremely
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
if
your
looking
to
turn
someone
over
to
the
dark
side
then
this
is
your
beer
d
easy
to
drink
i
love
köstritzer
but
this
isnt
quite
as
good
dark
black
color
with
very
minimal
tan
head
malty
aroma
taste
is
a
burnt
caramel
very
malty
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
and
almost
no
hop
flavor
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
my
first
venture
into
this
style
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
black
in
color
with
some
ruby
red
highlights
that
emerge
only
if
held
to
a
bright
light
a
bubbly
tan
head
that
clings
very
nicely
burnt
malts
cinammonsugar
and
roasted
dark
coffee
beans
nice
the
body
reveals
some
coffee
beans
dark
chocolate
and
becomes
acidic
and
sweet
within
the
same
breath
enjoyable
the
body
turns
a
bit
dry
but
not
over
the
top
barley
notes
and
roasted
malts
are
further
revealed
traces
of
sweet
caramel
round
out
the
finish
drinkability
is
high
as
the
flavorings
meld
well
with
the
creamy
like
body
a
sessionableschwarz
do
it
the
black
lager
pours
a
dark
umber
brown
topped
with
a
creamy
whitish
head
good
head
retention
and
lacing
good
clarity
no
complaints
looks
solid
so
far
the
nose
is
rich
with
caramel
malt
softly
roasty
with
that
signature
bit
of
sam
adams
bite
its
hard
to
place
im
not
sure
if
its
a
slightly
agressive
hopping
or
some
extra
graininess
to
the
malt
whatever
it
is
it
comes
through
as
some
harshness
in
the
flavor
as
compared
to
european
style
couterparts
the
black
lager
is
one
of
the
smoothest
of
the
sam
adams
offerings
probably
a
great
beer
to
get
started
on
dark
beer
anyways
the
flavor
comes
off
a
bit
different
than
the
aroma
much
smoother
most
notably
very
european
with
a
silky
smooth
texture
and
fine
tingly
carbonation
mellowed
caramel
sweetness
is
tempered
by
some
roasty
toffeeish
notes
very
clean
i
cant
pick
up
any
off
flavors
perhaps
a
bit
of
plum
esters
which
only
works
with
the
beer
mild
noble
hops
in
the
finish
riding
out
clean
and
dry
solid
roastiness
in
the
end
kinda
coffeeish
present
but
not
dominating
maybe
a
little
fuller
flavored
than
the
average
german
schwarzbiers
but
nothing
stands
out
enough
to
make
this
particularly
unique
they
nailed
the
style
for
sure
and
its
very
drinkable
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
next
time
im
heading
to
a
party
this
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
that
shows
deep
red
when
held
up
to
a
light
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
the
head
doesnt
last
long
but
leaves
some
bubbles
and
lacing
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
with
a
touch
of
spice
from
the
hops
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
comes
through
in
the
taste
a
bit
of
spice
is
evident
too
the
body
is
light
smooth
and
a
little
bubbly
for
some
reason
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
great
drinkability
for
me
maybe
the
malt
flavor
is
a
bit
sharp
and
unbalanced
for
my
taste
a
good
beer
all
the
same
i
also
got
mine
from
the
mix
pack
but
tasted
earlier
this
year
poured
a
neat
brown
the
shade
of
maple
syrup
with
a
tinge
of
garnet
coming
through
with
the
light
not
much
head
with
a
few
spots
of
lace
aromaroasted
malt
the
dark
or
roasted
malt
gives
it
just
a
little
extra
body
without
deviating
from
the
lager
style
nice
crisp
clean
lager
taste
the
mild
hops
mix
well
with
the
dark
malt
for
a
nice
earthy
and
balanced
taste
tannins
are
present
and
it
finishes
clean
picked
this
one
out
of
their
holiday
mix
pack
pretty
good
collection
here
but
i
havent
tried
the
cranberry
lambic
yet
thought
id
had
this
before
but
i
guess
thats
what
ba
is
here
to
tell
me
i
havent
very
smooth
creamy
like
schwarzbier
great
example
of
the
style
a
bit
malty
but
not
too
heavy
at
all
this
is
a
great
example
of
turning
someone
on
to
a
darker
beer
i
recommend
this
as
something
different
to
try
for
stout
drinkers
a
great
lager
for
the
winter
time
also
flavor
is
primiarly
full
roasted
malts
with
edges
of
caramel
floral
hop
accent
flavor
is
excellent
but
could
be
more
robust
very
drinkable
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
black
lager
pours
dark
brown
with
a
long
lasting
offwhite
head
theres
a
decent
bit
of
lacing
with
this
beer
too
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
it
tastes
like
roasted
malt
bread
caramel
and
semisweet
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
goes
down
easy
not
a
great
beer
but
a
pretty
good
one
not
a
bad
choice
as
a
session
beer
either
this
is
a
very
good
lager
i
had
one
yesterday
that
i
enjoyed
very
well
and
had
this
one
today
ill
probably
have
one
tommorrow
this
is
something
to
drink
and
enjoy
probably
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
and
its
not
my
favorite
style
had
to
drink
it
since
its
on
my
beer
tour
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
freshness
date
of
mar
2007
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
34
inch
head
with
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
with
hints
of
chocolate
in
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
not
thin
like
most
lagers
but
not
as
thick
as
a
porter
or
stout
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
a
porter
just
a
little
weaker
with
notes
of
chocolate
dominating
the
flavor
but
still
extremely
enjoyable
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
continue
to
come
back
to
good
job
sam
adams
the
best
sam
adams
ive
ever
had
i
have
just
recently
reopened
myself
to
sam
adam
after
a
few
years
and
i
have
to
say
this
beer
gives
me
hope
for
bigger
and
better
things
pouring
vigorously
into
a
clean
weizen
glass
produced
a
thick
tan
head
that
slowly
faded
to
a
thin
coating
atop
the
wetline
of
the
glass
a
nice
crisp
lacey
residue
left
on
the
glass
color
ranged
from
amber
to
chocolate
and
finished
an
opaque
ebony
with
the
glass
filled
the
nose
was
malty
with
a
hint
of
hoppiness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
almost
watery
flavour
was
malty
with
crisp
hoppy
highlights
and
no
perceived
bitterness
a
well
balanced
beer
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
dark
amber
with
a
bit
of
efervesence
and
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
sharp
toasted
malt
with
some
hints
of
dark
fruit
the
beer
tastes
of
toasted
malt
then
rounds
out
to
a
very
sweet
coffee
taste
the
feel
is
medium
and
a
bit
oily
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
almost
a
light
stout
feel
to
it
definately
one
ill
sample
again
nice
very
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
two
or
three
finger
creamy
tan
head
with
fair
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
bready
caramel
slighty
fruity
caramel
and
toasted
malt
a
very
small
hop
taste
at
the
end
and
slightly
sweet
light
mouthfeel
but
not
watery
very
smooth
going
down
very
nice
beer
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
im
glad
they
sell
it
on
its
own
instead
of
making
you
buy
a
holiday
case
to
get
two
bottles
of
the
stuff
ive
bought
6packs
of
this
before
and
i
will
continue
to
samuel
adams
black
lager
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
thick
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
left
a
sheet
of
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
toasty
dark
malt
the
taste
was
sweet
dark
malts
with
a
little
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
it
finished
dry
and
a
little
bitter
it
was
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
very
good
dark
lager
simple
american
schwarzbier
almost
feels
like
a
watered
down
porter
emphasis
on
the
water
the
flavors
are
not
bold
or
daring
and
could
be
better
melded
to
my
tongue
the
bitterness
was
completely
absent
this
contributed
to
lack
of
balance
and
direction
black
lager
is
not
wonderful
but
definitely
not
bad
black
lager
sounded
much
more
powerful
than
it
was
i
never
knew
it
was
a
schwarzbier
nor
what
a
schwarzbier
was
now
i
understand
the
subtleness
maybe
this
is
just
not
the
style
for
me
too
mild
but
not
bad
another
beer
from
the
sam
adams
mix
six
pack
black
lager
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
black
with
a
light
brown
head
i
smell
sweet
caramel
malts
as
well
as
a
slight
roasted
aroma
taste
is
deep
caramel
and
raisin
with
a
slightly
astringent
bitterness
from
the
roasted
malt
no
hops
to
be
found
but
that
fits
just
fine
im
kind
of
confused
with
the
name
black
lager
not
too
discriptive
but
i
guess
many
other
beers
are
just
ale
or
lager
so
not
too
big
a
deal
overall
well
it
tastes
like
black
i
suppose
thats
good
flavors
are
a
bit
odd
for
me
though
tastes
like
motor
oil
overall
a
good
shwarzbier
lots
of
grainy
notes
along
with
a
bit
of
balancing
hops
good
fallwinter
beer
recommended
overall
a
damn
tasty
offering
from
sam
adams
very
refreshing
very
tasty
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
at
last
this
arrives
in
salemoregon
nice
dark
brown
beer
with
a
large
tightcreamy
tan
head
very
attractive
light
roasted
malt
aromas
some
hints
of
semidark
chocolate
as
the
label
says
there
is
a
quite
luxuriant
malty
taste
to
begin
with
and
this
coats
the
front
of
the
tongue
then
some
hops
make
an
appearance
and
the
beer
finishes
semidry
some
hints
of
coffee
and
english
toffee
in
the
malts
quite
nice
nice
mouthfeel
it
starts
off
quite
smooth
and
thickish
but
thns
out
near
the
end
for
an
almost
crisp
finish
not
quite
though
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
worth
drinking
i
enjoyed
this
pours
black
with
tinges
of
garnet
at
the
edges
nice
somewhat
frothy
2
finger
light
tan
head
that
settles
to
about
18
with
good
lacing
smell
is
of
caramel
and
sweet
and
roasted
malts
it
is
fairly
subtle
and
less
aromatic
than
any
other
sam
adams
ive
had
before
taste
is
roasted
malts
with
some
bitterness
followed
by
some
nice
caramel
sweetness
i
also
tasted
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
nice
mouthfeel
fairly
light
in
body
which
is
generally
representative
of
the
style
great
drinkability
low
abv
light
body
and
the
balance
and
relative
depth
of
flavors
make
this
an
easily
drinkable
brew
overall
not
a
bad
beer
its
good
to
have
sometimes
but
it
always
leaves
me
craving
a
guinness
i
dont
know
if
its
the
dark
color
or
the
sweet
taste
but
after
drinking
one
of
these
i
just
want
a
guinness
drinkability
the
strong
taste
belies
a
minimally
4
9abv
aside
from
a
slight
fullfeeling
from
the
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
single
or
insession
if
they
had
this
as
a
seasonal
choice
at
a
bar
id
pick
it
over
bmc
but
its
eh
otherwise
average
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
a
little
more
drinkable
than
the
orginal
sam
adams
boston
lager
this
is
a
damn
fine
lager
and
has
moved
to
near
the
top
of
my
choices
for
the
genre
i
would
drink
this
again
recommend
it
highly
and
could
session
it
as
well
a
very
pleasing
dance
between
interesting
deeper
tastes
associated
with
other
heavier
genres
yet
still
light
refreshing
looks
like
my
friends
were
right
on
about
this
one
with
an
emphasis
on
caramel
and
sweeter
than
the
german
examples
i
have
tried
bbcs
black
lager
still
deserves
a
try
due
to
its
apperance
qualities
imho
a
lighter
caramel
emphasis
would
improve
this
beer
but
then
a
lack
of
decocted
melanoidins
may
then
become
an
issue
a
satisfing
dextrinous
mouth
feel
is
correct
for
the
style
and
dark
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
are
well
balanced
by
hops
that
dry
the
sweet
flavors
i
will
have
a
hard
time
passing
by
a
sixer
the
next
trip
to
a
liquor
store
ive
definitely
had
better
of
this
style
but
this
brew
is
hardly
a
slacker
in
the
schwarzbier
department
it
holds
its
own
as
a
solid
session
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
seems
to
be
very
flavorful
as
well
i
have
only
tried
one
of
other
beer
of
the
style
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
two
overall
the
flavors
were
competent
but
unremarkable
its
wellcrafted
but
this
is
a
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
affair
and
im
not
sure
that
i
knew
anything
about
this

after
two
pints

i
didnt
know
after
two
sips
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
fluffy
foamy
head
that
leaves
sick
lace
smell

pretty
sweet
with
hints
of
bitter
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
very
malt
and
roasted
like
some
warm
nuts
on
a
fire
a
good
offering
from
sam
adams
it
was
included
in
the
winter
sam
pack
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
malt
flavored
soda
but
i
liked
it
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
cant
imagine
a
situation
in
which
this
would
be
available
and
there
wouldnt
also
be
choices
i
prefer
over
this
smell
is
of
sweet
dark
malts
chocolate
a
little
bit
of
coffee
taste
is
really
good
consisting
of
tons
of
roastiness
that
follows
through
with
the
aftertaste
cofffee
flavors
chocolate
tons
of
chocolate
malts
some
caramel

creamy
extremely
drinkable
great
for
sessioning
this
is
a
unique
beer
from
samuel

and
can

favorites
from

opaque
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
is
leaving
a
lacing
nose
is
of
roasted
malts
taste

a
nice
combo
of
roasted
chocolate
malts
with
a
very
light
hopping
flavor
is
deceivingly
sweet
mouthfeel

nice
and
smooth
which
lends
to
an
enjoyable
finish

good
at
4
9
abv
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
for
those
that
enjoy
this
style
i
really
like
this
one
not
complex
but
hands
down
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
dark
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
i
do
wish
i
could
get
this
in
bulk
a
session
dark
lagervery
tastey
and
quite
pleasingeasy
drinking
a
very
good
beer
worth
a
try
a
good
beer
but
a
little
two
sweet
to
be
a
daily
addition
to
the
fridge
pours
a
deep
clear
very
dark
brown
with
a
twofinger
head
that
dissipates
moderately
visible
carbonation
leaving
delicate
lacing
nice
malty
aroma
taste
is
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
and
clean
surprisingly
light
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
samuel
adams
samuel
adams
black
lager
pours
appropriately
enough
a
black
color
with
ruby
around
the
edges
with
a
thin
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
and
sugar
the
taste
has
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
and
is
on
the
sweet
side
i
like
it
its
a
pretty
good
interpretation
of
a
schwarzbier
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
but
not
much
lace
at
all
it
smelled
like
an
irish
stout
very
very
smooth
no
bad
after
taste
i
have
enjoyed
this
sam
adams
the
most
out
of
all
the
sams
i
have
had
dont
drink
and
review
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
that
i
will
pick
up
again
very
nice
after
the
double
bock
and
cream
stout
this
is
my
favorite
brew
by
sam
adams
pours
out
a
really
nice
dark
color
and
smells
good
its
got
a
nice
body
to
it
and
goes
down
beautifully
i
tasted
some
nice
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
taste
finishes
off
with
a
nice
bitter
taste
good
stuff
satisfying
dark
malt
taste
with
roasted
coffee
leading
the
aftertaste
could
stand
some
thickening
in
the
body
but
doent
suffer
as
much
from
skinny
mouthfeel
as
a
lesser
brew
would
because
the
flavor
still
stands
up
well
and
theres
plenty
of
it
a
little
overboard
on
the
carbonation
but
still
drinkable
and
surprisingly
smooth
i
would
definitely
seek
this
out
again
d
this
is
good
stuff
and
i
can
think
of
quite
a
few
porters
that
arent
this
good
ill
be
getting
this
again
smooth
wellbalanced
tasty
this
is
actually
the
second
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
it
was
much
better
this
time
than
i
remembered
a
great
brew
i
think
i
will
drink
it
again
drinkability
a
nice
flavorful
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brown
head
and
is
vivid
black
color
with
ruby
red
highlights
quite
impressive
for
a
lager
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
a
little
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
very
smooth
and
crisp
with
lots
of
malt
and
caramel
notes
mouthfeel
is
just
what
a
lager
should
be
smooth
and
clean
and
thats
just
what
it
was
hopefully
i
will
look
around
and
try
to
check
some
of
the
same
style
out
slainte
no
alcohol
is
present
here
and
this
might
be
a
session
beer
depends
on
who
is
drinking
this
overall
not
much
to
say
here
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
flirts
with
the
idea
of
black
but
not
quite
a
thin
head
with
minimal
lacing
appears
smells
of
roasted
coffee
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
as
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
more
milky
chocolate
some
caramel
coffee
and
a
hint
of
licorice
good
but
a
tad
sweet
a
mild
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
sweetness
and
it
could
be
a
bit
more
dry
pours
deep
black
ruby
in
color
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
aroma
is
a
bit
subdued
but
there
are
scents
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolaty
caramel
detectable
the
same
roasty
chocolaty
caramel
in
the
aroma
comes
across
in
the
taste
along
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
dark
fruit
hop
bitterness
seems
at
a
minimal
level
very
happy
that
i
found
these
sammy
mix
packs
it
has
allowed
me
to
try
many
different
beer
styes
as
i
am
somewhat
new
to
beer
exploration
have
drank
beer
all
my
life
but
never
really
worried
about
styles
and
such
just
gimme
a
beer
plz
d
very
easy
to
drink
even
for
a
darker
beer
straight
4s
across
the
board
a
very
solidly
good
beer
dont
hesitate
to
pick
up
a
6pack
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
very
nice
offering
from
a
large
brewery
easy
to
have
a
few
of
this
easy
drinkin
good
tastin
beer
pours
out
a
dark
dark
brown
almost
to
the
point
of
being
black
some
dark
ruby
hues
you
can
just
barely
make
out
your
fingers
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
thick
almond
head
that
settles
down
to
5
and
leaves
thick
lacing
patterns
smokey
roasted
malts
stick
out
in
the
nose
along
with
some
chocolate
dried
fruit
and
clean
lager
aromas
smoky
roasty
lightly
chocolatey
slightly
acidic
and
clean
in
the
finish
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
mild
astringency
has
an
interesting
malted
milk
ball
flavor
thing
going
on
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
some
prickling
carbonation
tasty
and
drinkable
d
all
in
all
a
pleasant
surprise
dark
color
smelled
fairly
serious
and
heavy
however
the
fruit
flavors
and
light
mouthfeel
really
provided
a
pleasant
surprise
i
could
session
this
one
for
sure
another
good
one
from
sam
adams
this
is
another
style
that
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
so
i
dont
really
know
how
this
stands
up
to
other
schwartzbiers
it
was
kind
of
stoutlike
but
cleaner
and
with
a
milder
flavor
kind
of
like
i
would
expect
from
a
lager
it
wasnt
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
was
tasty
and
i
would
drink
it
again
recommended
pours
an
almost
pitch
blackdark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
aroma
is
sweet
chocolate
caramel
and
a
little
bit
of
malt
taste
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
caramel
and
a
bit
of
hops
wow
this
is
definately
better
than
expected
overall
this
is
a
great
schwarzbier
that
is
recommended
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
offering
from
boston
beer
company
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
light
bodied
well
light
for
a
dark
beer
i
guess
that
meets
the
style
guidelines
carbonation
is
in
check
would
be
nice
if
the
beer
were
a
little
bit
creamier
as
the
appearance
of
the
head
suggests
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
refreshing
especially
after
a
long
day
of
brewing
not
to
mention
my
first
all
grain
batch
this
beer
comes
as
a
well
earned
relief
id
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
but
probably
not
before
ive
had
other
schwarzbiers
sam
adams
once
again
outdoes
its
self
another
soontobe
classic
conditions
mowingworking
on
car
n
with
friends
y
sipping
n
get
my
buzz
on
y
food
craving
fat
slab
of
pork
and
kartoffel
salat
this
is
an
excellent
sessioner
and
a
good
food
beer
for
the
fall
but
it
isnt
very
deep
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
but
that
is
probably
par
for
the
style
and
doesnt
hurt
with
food
paring
imo
i
would
pick
this
up
again
im
thinking
cookouts
bonfires
and
tailgating
samuel
adams
black
lager
is
a
very
heavy
filling
beer
i
would
not
have
another
right
after
but
i
will
definately
enjoy
another
in
the
future
this
is
of
course
nearly
black
with
a
hint
of
deep
red
nice
tan
head
which
persists
and
coats
a
mug
smells
very
good
roasted
malt
and
coffee
very
little
hops
but
just
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
well
balanced
but
less
roasted
malt
and
sweeter
than
the
smell
suggests
its
noticeably
less
bitter
than
black
forest
its
mediumlight
in
body
smooth
texture
mediumlow
carbonation
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
healthy
twotothree
finger
light
tan
head
with
black
but
very
slightly
opaque
body
smells
very
malty
with
some
caramel
notes
sweet
and
malty
roasty
lighter
flavored
and
bodied
than
i
anticipated
though
it
is
by
no
means
light
in
either
tasty
ive
never
had
a
schwartzbier
but
if
this
is
what
theyre
like
im
trying
more
reminds
me
in
some
ways
of
ayinger
cellebrator
dopplebock
my
first
black
lager
i
look
forward
to
having
more
examples
from
this
style
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
a
one
schwarzbier
is
my
wifes
favorite
stylehigh
malt
sweet
low
hop
and
sam
adams
black
lager
is
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
and
i
think
a
good
choice
for
a
transition
beer
for
those
moving
into
the
micro
world
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
but
has
enough
copper
tones
around
the
edge
as
to
not
be
too
scary
head
is
thick
and
rocky
and
the
colored
of
the
inside
of
a
malted
milk
ball
which
is
appropriate
with
the
strong
chocolate
taste
and
a
not
so
subtle
hint
of
coffee
underneath
no
hop
aroma
and
the
nose
is
very
light
but
some
fruity
undertones
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
except
for
a
bit
of
a
carbonation
bite
i
like
the
beer
a
lot
however
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
and
doesnt
fill
up
my
mouth
with
the
taste
and
the
end
of
the
beer
is
watery
with
no
final
punch
pick
it
up
like
i
did
in
a
variety
pack
if
you
have
the
room
on
the
beer
run
this
opaque
and
flat
black
beer
has
a
minimal
eggshellcolored
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
very
strong
very
tasty
and
actually
has
a
mouthwatering
rich
coffee
character
to
it
start
is
somewhat
sweet
but
very
oaky
and
heady
the
beginning
of
this
drink
reminded
me
of
a
porter
settles
fullbodied
and
bitter
with
some
malt
smoothness
flavors
are
coffee
and
caramel
finish
is
bitter
and
dry
with
a
rough
aftertaste
that
vanishes
quickly
a
nice
drinking
lager
with
a
roasted
taste
no
problem
drinking
a
few
smell
this
beer
and
you
know
what
youre
getting
roasted
malty
flavor
thats
occasionally
chocolatey
or
even
nutty
that
said
this
is
no
stout
the
flavors
are
subtler
and
the
beer
is
lighter
and
altogether
more
drinkable
tasted
just
as
at
home
with
a
chicken
sandwich
as
it
did
with
a
piece
of
fine
dark
chocolate
quite
a
quaffable
brew
drinkability
i
find
this
beer
quite
sessionable
and
easily
consumable
im
almost
through
my
first
six
pack
and
will
be
buying
more
i
cant
wait
to
go
back
and
visit
boston
this
winter
hopefully
finding
this
on
tap
at
doyles
overall
a
worthy
offering
from
jim
koch
and
friends
it
takes
the
lager
to
new
worlds
as
should
be
the
case
when
85
of
the
world
drinks
tasteless
fizzy
yellow
bile
the
clean
finish
makes
this
very
drinkable
i
believe
this
is
my
first
schwarzbier
and
i
look
forward
to
a
few
more
id
drink
this
as
a
summer
beer
but
i
can
see
it
making
a
really
good
autumnwinter
drink
solid
work
drinkability
i
wish
this
beer
was
a
6
pack
of
black
lager
not
the
6
pack
of
variety
beer
because
this
one
you
could
drink
all
night
this
lager
reminds
me
of
a
local
brewery
oak
pond
brewery
in
skowhegan
me
that
makes
laughing
loon
lager
which
has
many
of
the
same
characteristics
as
the
sam
adams
black
lager
mmm
deeeelicious
drinkability
pleasant
and
drinkable
rather
quickly
disappating
head
when
held
to
light
it
reveals
a
deep
red
coloration
not
apparent
in
a
dimmer
environment
i
smelled
notes
of
salt
water
taffy
but
this
was
very
subtle
and
the
smell
is
rather
weak
overall
malts
give
a
roasted
character
to
this
while
allowing
hops
to
balace
very
well
it
has
a
light
bodied
refreshing
feel
to
it
and
has
a
slightly
lingering
malt
aftertaste
as
well
drinkability
not
bad
but
i
think
if
i
want
a
seriously
dark
beer
ill
go
for
an
ale
and
get
a
broader
array
of
flavors
thickness
detracts
a
bit
from
drinkability
it
pours
black
with
ruby
highlights
the
look
and
smell
of
this
stuff
does
a
pretty
spot
on
impersonation
of
a
porter
or
stout
although
the
roasted
malts
are
far
less
intense
in
the
taste
than
those
in
dark
ales
brown
sugar
yeast
chocolate
and
central
american
coffee
roughly
in
that
order
round
out
the
taste
i
appreciate
how
much
bbc
is
pushing
a
fairly
adventurous
style
all
things
considered
like
this
one
a
fair
amount
of
chocolate
comes
through
in
the
smell
and
leads
into
the
taste
coffee
flavor
is
present
but
minimal
giving
way
to
more
malt
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
while
drinkability
is
very
good
i
really
enjoyed
the
look
and
eroma
very
subtle
nutlike
smell
bottom
line
smooth
good
tasting
beer
could
be
a
little
stronger
with
taste
and
alcolhol
but
still
really
good
seriously
im
just
getting
nit
picky
this
is
a
good
beer
well
worth
a
try
a
coarse
mouthfeel
spils
an
otherwise
excellent
beer
with
a
rich
bodied
roasted
coffee
flavor
that
is
slightly
sweetened
reminiscent
of
a
classic
porter
this
goes
down
easy
maybe
too
easy
though
at
4
9
and
with
only
2
in
the
holiday
pack
im
in
no
danger
of
oding
on
this
black
lager
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
and
another
quality
beer
from
sam
adams
o
my
good
daddy
who
built
me
with
my
knockers
on
the
low
i
love
this
sap
it
is
the
perfect
accoutrement
for
the
lowclass
denizen
desserter
of
keebler
cookies
and
chips
ahoy
im
not
a
fan
of
coffee
but
this
reminds
me
of
coffee
with
a
dark
chocolate
brain
it
thinks
burnt
but
says
savor
i
could
easily
become
a
drunk
rotting
my
teeth
out
further
on
this
brimmed
black
wizened
wine
of
puddings
all
stars
here
along
with
his
step
uncle
schwarz
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
from
12
oz
bottle
dark
brownblack
color
off
white
head
aroma
of
roasted
malts
taste
is
roasted
malt
with
some
malty
sweetness
seems
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
i
could
easily
drink
another
this
is
a
good
beer
but
if
im
looking
for
a
schwarzbier
i
think
i
would
opt
for
rahrs
ugly
pug
if
i
have
the
choice
pours
to
a
dark
chocolate
color
nice
clingy

hearty
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
hamburger
or
a
nice
thick
steak
yet
another
tasty
selection
from
samuel
adams
who
never
dissappoints
drinkability

this
was
a
tad
offstyle
but
is
an
excellent
drinker
and
incredibly
smooth
its
an
obscure
style
but
sam
adams
gave
us
a
nice
rendition
here
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
personally
prefer
a
bit
more
hop
presence
in
the
flavor
but
a
decent
offering
if
i
were
more
familiar
with
the
schwarzbier
style
i
might
rate
this
higher
or
lower
appears
a
near
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
and
roasty
the
taste
is
a
smooth
balance
of
sweetness
and
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
coffee
with
just
a
nice
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
at
only
4
90
abv
one
of
sams
best
brews
and
definitely
one
i
can
recommend
12
oz
bottle
from
sam
adams
mixed
12
pack
appearance
was
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
red
highlights
the
beer
was
clear
but
almost
opaque
moderately
tan
head
the
aroma
was
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
caramel
and
molasses
taste
was
similar
with
a
balance
of
hop
bitterness
which
was
present
mainly
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
moderately
carbonated
and
somewhat
drying
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
i
usually
like
a
little
more
hops
in
my
beer
but
its
nice
for
the
style
and
a
good
malt
fix
drinkability
a
moderate
to
low
abv
and
great
taste
whats
there
not
to
like
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
by
this
black
with
a
crownamber
hue
that
peeks
through
in
the
light
yields
a
thin
but
very
creamy
almond
colored
head
smells
sweet
and
thick
with
a
distinctly
german
lager
aroma
tastes
sweet
and
roasty
but
no
harshness
to
speak
of
mostly
just
dark
sweetness
very
nonthreatening
sweet
and
rich
with
an
extremely
slight
alcohol
aroma
in
the
finish
caramel
malts
are
dominant
but
the
darker
malts
add
great
complexity
here
very
appealing
im
new
to
this
style
its
darker
than
a
brown
ale
and
definately
not
as
intense
in
the
dark
malts
as
a
porter
and
distinctly
a
lager
for
another
twist
mouthfeel
is
thich
and
full
but
slightly
more
carbonated
that
desirable
excellent
drinkability
and
all
around
this
is
sam
adams
impressive
i
actually
think
id
reccomend
this
beer
more
often
than
id
drink
it
most
likely
i
doubt
id
buy
a
sixer
of
it
too
often
but
i
can
see
friends
enjoying
it
and
picking
up
a
single
for
myself
from
time
to
time
with
my
only
concern
being
that
most
people
might
at
first
be
unaacustomed
to
the
german
hops
and
lager
yeast
characteristics
when
expecting
a
dark
stout
like
beer
by
appearance
overall
a
great
offering
a
very
good
evening
session
beer
when
you
want
that
malty
lager
that
will
go
down
fast
chocolate
and
heavy
malt
was
evident
in
the
aroma
immediately
appearance
was
similar
to
a
stout
dark
in
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
i
didnt
note
much
of
a
spiciness
in
this
but
the
malt
and
chocolatecarmel
were
very
evident
and
consistent
throughout
the
glass
tasty
beer
with
a
good
finish
easy
enough
to
drink
with
a
mellow
abv
worth
a
try
but
wasnt
impressed
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
not
something
you
can
get
drunk
of
because
of
the
flavors
but
this
is
definetely
enjoyable
amongst
friends
ive
never
liked
s
a
s
boston
lager
but
figured
id
give
them
another
chance
by
giving
this
a
try
good
thing
i
did
because
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
definitely
not
an
everyday
beer
since
its
quite
rich
and
a
tad
heavy
but
it
hardly
has
to
be
one
of
those
special
occasiononly
beers
give
this
a
try
if
you
havent
already
black
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
stays
around
a
while
the
smell
is
of
roasted
caramel
hell
im
no
expert
on
smells
i
just
know
it
smells
good
mouthfeel
is
good
not
too
fizzy
and
goes
down
real
good
with
just
a
little
lingering
aftertaste
that
some
may
find
objectional
i
myself
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
look
forward
to
getting
some
more
smooth
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
slightly
spicy
finish
with
a
bit
of
coffee
aftertaste
possibly
a
bit
lighter
in
body
and
taste
than
some
versions
but
this
just
seems
to
make
it
easier
to
drink
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
i
suppose
eric
drinkability
im
unimpressed
this
is
something
interesting
to
try
occasionally
probably
best
when
paired
with
strong
meats
or
cheese
by
itself
it
is
not
particularly
refreshing
or
alluring
d
well
its
very
tasty
and
very
light
so
i
can
see
myself
having
an
entire
six
of
these
no
problem
everything
about
the
beer
is
pleasant
it
could
just
be
more
so
but
even
without
more
taste
or
more
body
its
extremely
drinkable
d
drinkable
but
eh
a
good
change
of
pace
but
not
sure
id
go
after
this
one
again
nothing
special
here
overall
a
successful
treat
from
sam
adams
not
one
of
their
best
but
certainly
worth
picking
up
for
its
better
attributes
just
a
few
steps
over
from
a
porter
or
stout
but
less
heavy
in
terms
of
body
and
abv
i
liked
the
appearance
of
this
beer
deep
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
some
burgundy
around
the
sides
and
a
deep
caramel
colored
head
i
found
the
smell
and
taste
quite
similar
coffee
and
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
nutty
flavor
this
is
a
smooth
and
semisweet
beer
the
finish
has
a
nice
slightly
hoppy
flavor
as
well
there
is
nothing
inherently
bad
about
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
but
i
think
i
would
get
bored
with
it
after
a
few
refreshing
though
overly
sweet
and
thin
in
flavor
compared
to
aroma
drinkability
fantastic
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
very
deep
chestnut
color
almost
black
a
few
ruby
edges
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
rich
offwhite
frothy
head
forms
and
remains
intact
throughout
the
life
of
the
beer
aroma
of
caramel
and
chocolate
nice
flavor
of
sweet
charred
caramel
followed
up
by
hints
of
chocolate
hints
of
toasty
flavors
finishes
with
enough
noble
hops
to
balance
things
out
i
have
had
some
of
this
style
that
finish
so
sweet
and
cloying
however
this
one
does
not
a
very
nice
effort
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
beer
ive
only
had
a
few
times
before
overall
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
not
something
id
drink
often
but
its
still
heads
and
shoulders
above
the
usual
macro
stuff
this
beer
is
decently
complex
and
easy
to
drink
a
well
crafted
session
beer
this
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
light
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
virtually
no
lacing
the
smell
is
kinda
nice
mostly
caramel
and
malt
the
taste
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
saranac
black
forest
but
it
is
good
caramelly
and
malty
as
fuck
there
are
soem
coffee
hints
also
flavor
is
nice
but
doesnt
really
grab
you
kinda
leaves
a
yucky
porter
like
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
but
kinda
watery
it
is
pretty
slick
to
the
tounge
kinda
drinkable
but
it
leaves
such
a
blah
taste
in
your
mouth
try
a
black
forest
instead
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
good
option
for
those
establishments
where
the
best
they
serve
is
sam
adams
and
you
want
something
a
little
different
light
for
such
a
dark
malty
beer
it
is
a
lager
i
could
have
a
few
without
complaint
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
brownish
black
with
pretty
good
long
lasting
offwhite
head
and
thin
lacing
aroma
isnt
that
strong
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
some
caramel
in
there
pretty
pleasant
just
a
little
weak
taste
is
really
nice
one
of
my
more
favorite
lagers
ive
had
a
nice
chocolate
malt
and
molasses
is
matched
with
a
almost
thickish
creamy
smooth
body
and
a
slightly
eversopresent
floral
hop
that
balances
it
out
perfectly
very
nice
to
have
before
after
or
with
a
steak
btw
not
a
bad
example
of
this
style
though
ive
had
several
better
its
certainly
not
one
to
turn
down
and
worth
buying
if
better
ones
are
not
available
which
is
often
the
case
with
this
style
unfortunately
overall
drinkable
and
pleasant
enough
but
theres
not
much
personality
here
its
almost
as
if
sam
adams
brewed
a
9
beer
and
then
cut
it
in
half
with
water
its
quite
light
and
refreshing
for
a
malty
brew
but
probably
not
a
great
lawnmower
beer
a
smoothdrinking
solid
black
lager
the
only
downfall
is
a
lack
of
depth
there
isnt
much
else
to
say
another
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
overall
a
good
dark
lager
definitely
worth
a
try
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
but
this
one
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
friend
i
enjoy
roasted
flavors
so
this
one
hits
the
spot
it
gets
an
a
in
my
book
for
someone
with
a
little
experience
as
i
have
i
find
myself
very
surprised
that
i
prefer
a
strong
guinness
over
this
black
lager
i
certainly
wouldnt
choose
this
beer
again
this
beer
is
one
of
the
more
consistent
ones
i
have
tried
appearance
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
all
flow
smoothly
across
the
board
there
are
no
strange
aftertastes
damn
testy
and
sessionable
a
really
good
one
from
a
macro
company
worth
checking
out
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
surprisingly
light
an
excellent
schwarzbier
taste
and
mouthfeel
a
lightmedium
to
medium
body
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
malt
dominates
the
flavor
with
chocolate
being
the
top
dog
while
caramel
malt
plays
a
backup
role
a
slight
nuttiness
comes
in
play
at
the
end
of
the
sip
very
very
subtle
hints
of
fruityness
quite
drinkable
as
the
flavors
are
delicious
and
many
drinkability
it
right
there
folks
open
up
and
pour
it
down
you
could
drink
this
all
day
enjoy
mk
i
love
this
stuff
very
dark
dark
brown
when
poured
this
stuff
is
nice
the
smell
of
coffee
and
chocolate
fill
my
nose
as
it
goes
down
the
same
flavors
are
there
with
maltiness
making
this
beer
great
very
easy
to
drink
and
pleasing
i
got
to
give
it
to
the
boston
beer
co
on
this
one
d
i
liked
the
sa
black
lager
quite
a
bit
more
than
the
brown
ale
i
had
in
the
same
session
they
were
pretty
similar
but
i
thought
the
black
lager
had
more
to
offer
yeah
i
could
drink
this
stuff
even
often
but
i
usualy
wait
for
my
buddy
to
buy
it
in
a
mixed
sam
adams
pack
very
drinkable
scharzbier
a
nice
alternative
to
a
brown
ale
or
imperial
stout
brew
is
very
smooth
making
is
have
decent
drinkability
but
cant
say
much
else
i
am
about
to
say
screw
dark
brews
until
i
get
my
hands
on
some
more
guinness
or
until
i
try
murphys
of
beamish
appearance
was
colalike
dark
brown
with
a
large
bubbled
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
fizzy
film
and
eventually
disappeared
typical
lager
head
really
smell
is
sweet
dark
malts
quite
inviting
taste
is
mildly
sweet
mainly
caramel
with
a
little
dark
bread
and
very
little
hops
the
dark
brown
color
had
me
expecting
a
cocoa
flavor
but
alas
caramel
is
all
i
got
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
but
not
enough
flavor
or
spice
to
keep
me
interested
overall
i
just
think
this
could
be
a
much
better
beer
its
good
but
there
are
better
out
there
this
one
just
seems
so
close
to
being
a
great
beer
just
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
mellow
drinkability
good
stuff
i
could
drink
many
of
these
me
it
did
the
opposite
of
grow
on
me
at
the
end
of
the
glass
i
realize
why
i
liked
it
so
much
more
at
first
sip
than
i
remembered
after
having
mixed
reviews
of
different
sam
adams
beers
i
was
happy
after
trying
this
one
it
poured
out
to
a
nice
brown
color
with
an
average
amount
of
head
the
smell
was
that
of
roasted
nuts
and
barley
and
the
taste
is
the
same
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
was
the
taste
when
compared
to
the
texture
and
mouthfeel
i
enjoy
stouts
and
other
dark
beers
but
having
a
good
dark
lager
is
like
a
lessfilling
stout
i
could
definitely
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
still
enjoy
it
drinkability
i
didnt
enjoy
drinking
it
alone
i
would
prefer
to
pair
it
with
food
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
a
great
site
to
see
roasted
smell
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
other
sweet
characters
a
very
inviting
smell
i
love
the
balance
of
this
beer
not
over
powering
just
the
right
hints
of
sweet
and
bitter
this
beer
is
thin
like
the
lager
name
suggests
but
packs
a
flavorful
punch
and
because
of
such
a
great
mouthfeel
it
drives
the
ease
of
consumption
if
you
are
a
person
who
likes
the
flavor
of
stouts
or
porters
but
dislikes
the
heavy
feel
to
the
beer
then
this
lager
is
right
for
you
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
because
it
has
something
for
everyone
one
of
my
two
absolute
favorite
sam
adams
beers
cheers
though
its
easy
to
drink
this
seems
more
of
a
have
one
and
move
on
beer
not
because
its
bad
it
very
good
just
because
i
think
that
youd
be
wasting
a
wonderful
sensation
for
your
brain
and
taste
buds
if
you
try
and
session
this
beer
much
to
complex
for
that
d
sure
id
probably
drink
it
again
if
it
was
on
tap
or
in
the
singles
rack
of
my
favorite
liquor
store
black
lager
a
name
much
more
mysterious
than
the
taste
itself
a
pint
glass
reveals
a
nice
deep
very
dark
chestnut
no
its
not
actually
that
black
hue
with
a
rapidly
dissipating
burnt
ivory
head
in
fact
you
have
to
pour
somewhat
aggressively
to
achieve
a
decent
head
to
begin
with
roasted
toffee
greets
the
nose
as
you
notice
a
chocolaty
malt
flavor
followed
by
an
almost
dry
irish
stoutlike
bitter
finish
the
medium
body
however
lends
itself
to
more
social
drinking
but
im
not
so
sure
i
could
drink
to
many
in
one
sitting
ill
try
have
this
american
schwarzbier
with
any
meat
potato
combo
or
a
roasted
poultry
veggie
dish
enjoy
easy
to
drink
but
im
uninterested
sure
i
could
drink
it
again
but
it
is
nothing
im
picking
out
of
an
impressive
lineup
give
me
mönchshof
any
day
i
purchased
a
sixpack
in
sioux
falls
sd
but
i
have
seen
it
in
nebraska
since
it
is
decent
i
am
happy
sam
adams
has
beers
like
this
on
the
market

a

i
can
only
hope
to
find
this
on
tap
as
frequently
as
i
find
the
boston
lager
drinkability
this
is
a
disapointment
im
still
waiting
to
find
the
perfect
shwarz
but
am
still
looking
this
is
not
it
still
this
is
decent
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
seek
it
out
drinkability
like
the
lager
but
not
the
black
lager
all
show
and
no
go
one
of
sam
adams
better
offerings

tight
head
of
foam
very
light
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malts
i
might
be
able
to
pick
up
some
weak
chocolate
if
i
use
my
imagination
the
taste
is
more
bold
with
the
roastiness
showing
off
a
bit
and
the
chocolate
being
actually
noticeable
a
thinnish
body
with
modest
carbonation
nothing
too
memorable
for
me
but
its
alright
for
the
style
appearance
wise
i
dont
think
you
can
get
better
for
the
style
black
color
with
a
tan
head
that
stays
throughout
with
spotty
lacing
smell
is
of
coffee
toffee
and
roasted
grain
with
a
hint
of
hops
hidden
taste
hits
me
with
some
burnt
caramel
flavor
with
coffee
kicking
in
right
behind
it
no
real
detectable
hops
in
the
taste
but
it
doesnt
need
them
pretty
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
but
seems
just
about
right
very
drinkable
this
would
be
great
with
a
meal
or
just
having
a
couple
whenever
definately
a
good
decision
oelergud
drink
up
i
will
i
was
able
to
pick
up
just
one
bottle
to
try
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
copper
a
beige
foam
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
of
charred
oak
toasted
grain
semisweet
dark
chocolate
initial
taste
is
caramel
and
chocolate
followed
by
a
few
bitter
hops
that
try
but
cannot
overcome
the
caramel
sweetness
kind
of
watery
and
over
carbonated
acidic
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
schwarzebier
but
i
keep
thinking
with
a
little
more
body
it
would
make
a
decent
porter

i
miss
the
creaminess
not
sure
it
is
my
style
or
that
i
would
try
another
pours
a
clear
brownred
small
tan
head
forms
goes
fast
and
leaves
some
spots
of
lace
smell
is
sweet
cherries
lots
of
roasted
character
chocolate
dates
and
some
floral
taste
is
slightly
oxidized
some
dates
chocolate
roast
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
sweet
low
carbonation
and
a
watery
finish
pretty
good
drinkability
decent
could
have
another
but
probably
wont
for
a
while
overall
this
beer
is
my
favorite
out
of
the
current
brewmasters
collection
from
sam
adams
if
only
we
could
have
just
this
beer
alone
in
a
12
pack
i
have
to
admit
ive
stayed
away
from
sam
adams
brews
for
years
why
no
valid
reason
whatsoever
as
ive
discovered
recently
they
are
consistent
drinkable
fundamental
offerings
drinkablitiy
with
sprecher
around
this
just
isnt
up
to
par
a
good
stab
at
the
style
and
overall
a
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
but
just
like
most
of
the
other
beers
from
sam
adams
boston
beer
co
its
solid
not
stellar
however
i
do
think
that
the
boston
beer
co
deserves
a
little
more
credit
for
this
one
they
were
actually
bold
enough
to
market
a
beer
style
that
most
average
beer
drinkers
no
doubt
found
unusual
but
perhaps
even
a
bit
intimidating
if
its
dark
it
must
be
really
strong
but
by
all
accounts
its
been
well
received
recommended
didnt
expect
a
coffe
almost
stout
like
aroma
plenty
of
malt
aroma
and
a
little
chocolate
as
well
dark
brown
with
ruby
tones
and
a
firm
finger
thick
head
ok
this
tastes
like
a
watery
porter
very
roasty
with
a
lot
of
coffee
notes
malt
sweetness
there
with
a
touch
of
chocalate
again
and
some
vanilla
it
is
actually
a
solidly
good
beer
it
just
tastes
like
a
porter
and
not
a
schwarzbier
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
this
style
beer
iti
s
one
of
my
favorites
and
another
triumph
for
the
boston
beer
co
drinkability

my
first
in
the
style
very
interesting
quite
drinkable
hopefully
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
a
less
than
careful
pour
yields
a
2inch
rocky
tan
head
atop
a
garnetbrown
seethrough
beer
with
meager
carbonation
subtle
spicy
noble
hop
aroma
with
yeasty
sourdough
notes
tastes
sweeter
than
the
aroma
but
in
a
very
pleasing
way
doughycaramel
sweetness
of
malts
are
nicely
balanced
by
some
hallertauer
spiciness
creamy
mouthfeel
lighttomedium
body
actually
more
like
medium
its
just
lighter
than
i
expected
for
my
buck
i
think
i
prefer
a
more
local
offering
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
nonetheless
recommended
im
not
picking
up
much
in
the
way
of
bitterenss
no
aspect
of
the
flavor
seems
to
linger
too
long
for
me
its
dry
and
pleasant
i
dig
it
overall
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
in
this
one
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
sampled
one
appearance
was
black
with
ruby
colors
around
the
edges
off
white
head
that
was
a
bit
thin
the
taste
had
some
dark
chocolate
and
slightly
coffee
flavors
there
was
a
very
slight
amount
of
hops
in
the
after
taste
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
not
as
watery
as
some
stouts
can
be
of
course
i
guess
thats
because
its
not
a
stout
as
far
as
drinkabilty
goes
i
guess
you
could
knock
back
a
few
if
you
get
the
sam
adams
holiday
pack
this
has
the
lowest
alcohol
in
there
so
it
would
probably
be
the
only
one
you
could
have
a
few
of
and
not
lose
your
legs
this
beer
was
a
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
it
had
a
small
coffeecolored
head
that
had
good
retention
some
nice
lacing
a
sweet
caramel
odor
dont
get
too
much
of
the
roasted
grain
tasted
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
minimal
hoppiness
a
smooth
not
substantial
feel
pretty
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
good
shwartzbier
i
have
only
had
a
few
and
recall
those
being
a
bit
more
flavorful
but
this
is
a
pretty
tastey
beer
this
was
enjoyable
and
would
make
a
great
afterdinner
or
session
beer
i
couldnt
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
and
the
combination
of
flavors
works
well
together
here
i
look
forward
to
sampling
this
again
in
the
near
future
the
roast
comes
out
most
in
the
taste
chocolate
and
coffee
come
midway
and
the
hops
end
it
a
good
balance
smooth
toffee
rich
caramel
minimal
bitterness
but
detectable
hop
flavor
munich
malts
maybe
with
some
special
b
as
well
give
a
nice
smooth
roasty
character
with
a
great
subtle
chocolate
finish
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
medium
to
large
head
and
good
lacing
smells
of
coffee
and
cream
chocolate
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
lacking
for
a
dark
lager
i
little
too
on
the
coffee
end
for
my
preference
leaves
too
much
of
a
sour
taste
as
well
all
in
all
this
is
a
beer
i
would
drink
over
many
i
e
the
bud
lights
of
the
world
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
sorry
dave
yoder
smooth
malty
beverage
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
end
also
quite
a
presence
of
thick
chocolate
malts
that
add
a
degree
of
sweetness
a
very
hearty
mouthfeel
and
a
very
tummywarming
experience
overall

excellent

very
impressed
all
around
one
of
the
best
sam

ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
from
the
boston
beer
co
but
everything
else
to
this
beer
was
just
top
notch
and
hopefully
they
will
sell
this
in
six
packs
in
my
area
i
will
be
a
beer
advocate
on
this
one
this
bottle
was
part
of
a
winter
mixed
pack
the
label
is
notched
as

code

is

mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
overall
a
very
creamy
texture
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
maybe
a
little
more
hoppyness
would
be
in
order
a
dam
tasty
beer
d
better
than
most
of
sam
adamss
beers
it
would
work
with
many
foods
and
as
a
session
but
it
is
hardly
a
spectacular
beer
like
your
average
sam
adams
drink
this
cold
lest
the
offensive
flavors
come
out
to
play
i
mean
it
drink
this
before
it
turns
into
soy
sauce
maybe
it
would
go
well
with
sushi
pours
a
really
dark
amber

not
black
exactly
with
a
dull

foamy

taste
is
still
pretty

lots

not

flavors
not
exactly
complex
but
well
balanced
mouth
feel
has
plenty
of

as
well
as
body
overall
a
decent
brew
and
probably
my
favorite
offering
from
sam
adams
nicely
done
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
nice
dark
lager
im
sure
it
is
billed
as
a
seasonal
winter
offering
but
i
would
be
inclined
to
drink
it
occasionally
year
round
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
dark

for
a

impressed
with
the

tried

far

a

toasted

notes
of
burnt

and
coffee

mouthfeel
is
actually
a
little
creamy
which
was
surprising
one
of
the
more
substantial
schwarzes
ive
encountered
a
nice
offering
from
sam
adams
here
though
it
doesnt
quite
compete
with
wisconsins
own
black
bavarianmoravians
ive
had
5
or
6
of
their
brews
now
and
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
deal
so
much
so
that
it
prompted
my
first
beer
review
execellent
smoothness
and
taste
my
only
complaint
about
this
beer
is
that
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
its
only
available
alone
in
sixers
or
variety
packs
with
other
sam
adams
beers
2
per
6pack
3
per
12pack
i
dont
mind
trying
the
other
beers
but
i
would
like
to
buy
this
beer
in
alone
in
a
12pack
or
larger
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
head
rises
but
to
only
about
12

settling
to
a
nice

tan
cap
on
the
beer
lacing
stays
about
1
inch
above
the
beer
down
the
glass
the
nose
on
this
one
is
sweet
some
sour
dark
fruits
and
slight
sugary
grains
come
through
if
the
aroma
was
more
robust
it
would
command
a
much
higher
score
but
it
is
a
bit
faint
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
of
this
one
smooth
slightly
grainy
with
that
sour
dark
fruit
mirroring
the
nose
a
neat
mellow
burnt
flavor
fin
the
finish
but
an
overall
smooth
sweet
and
inviting
taste
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
adequately
carbonated
this
is
very
drinkable
beer
smooth
sweet
mild
and
not
too
heavy
easily
sessionable
a
nice
choice
for
the
cool
months
of
winter
overalla
great
sam
adams
dark
beer
to
drink
in
the
winter
glad
i
picked
it
up
overall
i
dont
get
to
drink
that
many
black
lagers
id
be
hard
pressed
to
name
more
than
a
couple
of
us
versions
of
the
style
so
this
is
a
solid
change
of
pace
and
it
is
nicely
done
i
would
but
this
again
enjoyable
da
very
nice

great
on

well
done
sam

cheers
body
between
medium

light
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
and
light

not
bad
at
all
i
dont
much
care
for
lagers
so
i
wont
lie
and
pretend
i
liked
this
one
its
just
strange
i
mean
if
i
want
stout
ill
drink
stout
if
i
was
partial
to
lager
id
drink
cat
piss
i
mean
lager
i
guess
this
could
be
a
good
crossover
beer
for
the
lager
fan
who
hasnt
gotten
into
darker
beer
kind
of
mixed
on
this
one
its
not
an
awful
beer
but
you
can
get
a
lot
better
props
to
the
bbc
for
trying
something
different
in
any
case

have
been
anxiously
awaiting
to
try
this
brew
ever
since
reading
about
it
in
ba
finally
found
it
as
part
of
a
brewmasters
collection
six
pack
pours
a
beautiful
mahogany
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
dark
brown
with
a
thinish
tan
head
that
fades

a

of

and
caramel
sweetness
attempt
at
balance
with
a
little
toasted
cofee
and
a
little
hops
a
little
buttery
in
the
back
gets
a
little
more
interesting
as
it
warms
medium
bodied
but
a
little
soda
like
in
the
mouth
but
this
doesnt
detract
too
much
pretty
drinkable
and
a
good
attempt
by
sam
adams
to
attract
their
audience
to
something
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
ive
had
a
few
bottles
of
this
one
out
on
the
town
and
also
purchased
a
sixpack
i
think
this
is
the
last
of
that
oh
well
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
decent
offering
especially
by
a
us
brewery
of
a
style
that
not
just
anybody
brews
up
on
a
regular
basis
pretty
dark
cola
in
color
but
theres
some
nice
reddish
highlights
in
the
bottom
of
my
glass
head
when
poured
was
like
1
2
inches
thick
but
has
since
died
down
to
the
top
of
the
brew
very
thin
now
i
think
the
aroma
is
the
most
authentic
aspect
of
this
brew
it
is
right
on
as
a
german
schwartzbier
rich
malt
natural
breadiyeastiness
that
has
a
prescence
but
isnt
overwhelming
tastewise
the
first
sip
is
really
good
nice
and
malty
seems
to
get
a
wee
bit
sweeter
while
drinking
but
really
an
easy
beer
to
turn
into
a
session
when
you
dont
want
to
go
overboard
medium
mouthfeel
id
get
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
nice
black
color
very
dark
almost
pitch
black
it
also
has
a
great
brown
extrafrothy
head
topping
off
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
molasses
maple
syrup
and
burnt
toast
tantalize
my
nose
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
malts
and
a
load
of
coffee
adding
to
the
collection
of
intense
flavors
and
scents
the
taste
also
finishes
clean
with
no
lingering
bad
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
just
shy
of
a
heavybodied
beer
it
goes
down
very
smooth
my
glass
was
emptied
much
sooner
than
i
expected
i
am
highly
impressed
by
this
beer
and
im
sure
it
will
soon
make
its
way
in
front
of
me
again
cheers
im
excited
to
try
this
one
ive
been
enjoying
schwarzbiers
more
lately
it
pours
a
rubied
darkbrown
color
wtih
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
generously
its
a
touch
light
in
color
for
my
liking
the
nose
is
robust
with
a
bit
of
roasted
nuttyness
and
a
very
nice
roasted
maltyness
maybe
a
touch
of
coffee
the
flavor
is
nice
as
well
slight
coffee
fairly
healthy
roasted
nuttyness
not
a
bad
brew
the
feel
is
moderate
to
full
with
a
medium
carbonation
i
think
i
am
going
to
have
to
grab
a
full
6
of
this
beer
i
could
be
happy
to
drink
this
one
often
notes
jim
koch
did
very
well
with
this
one
simply
an
amazing
beer
very
drinkable
to
get
one
through
a
cold

shelves
drinkability
notes
very
drinkable
however
with
the
amount
of
sugariness
id
need
to
cut
it
with
eating
something
preferably
desert
although
initially
finishes
clean
the
last
few
drops
lingered
leaving
a
sweet
aftertaste
not
overly
bad
but
cuts
back
on
its
session
beer
qualities
drinkability
is
good
only
my
second
of
this
style
should
have
rated
the
first
better
but
didnt
know
so
at
that
time
this
beer
is
fine
little
lager
i
would
recommend
you
atleast
try
its
nice
to
have
a
dark
beer
thats
almost
light
and
refreshing
nice
to
see
that
sam
adams
can
still
make
some
goodies
while
still
catering
to
the
masses
recommended
one
hell
of
a
beer
this
brew
poured
to
a
very
dark
brown
color
maybe
even
black
in
color
with
some
light
filtering
through
it
was
poured
with
a
fair
sized
light
brown
head
that
broke
down
quite
quickly
but
left
nice
rings
of
lace
down
the
entire
brew
the
aromas
of
this
brew
are
nice
solid
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
that
might
even
be
leaning
to
a
burnt
smell
the
taste
is
definitely
of
roasted
malts
along
with
a
chocolate
flavor
that
seems
to
me
as
being
quite
smooth
also
notice
a
nice
slight
hop
taste
at
the
end
that
goes
very
nice
with
this
brew
think
you
could
completely
miss
it
unless
you
are
looking
for
it
over
all
i
think
this
is
a
real
good
brew
will
get
some
more
as
i
feel
that
the
taste
of
this
will
appeal
to
some
of
my
less
adventurous
friends
this
black
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
chestnut
redbrown
color
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
a
fair
amount
the
smell
was
dark
malt
with
a
bit
of
molasses
the
taste
was
lightly
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
molasses
and
caramel
and
a
hint
of
yeast
very
low
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
modest
carbonation
there
was
a
mildly
malty
aftertaste
this
was
a
pretty
good
schwarzbier
but
perhaps
just
a
tad
too
sweet
this
pours
into
the
pint
glass
a
ruby
black
with
a
tan
head
about
12
inch
high
slight
lacing
aromatic
toasty

love
the
smell
tastes
malty
sweet
with
chocolate
notes
and
crisp
like
a
lager
like
im
drinking
a
crisp
stout
little
hop
taste
at
all
though
some
must
be
there
to
provide
what
little
balance
there
is
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
sweet
nice
carbonic
bite
in
the
finish
the
roasted
maltiness
is
felt
throughout
the
only
thing
that
keeps
this
from
being
a
top
notch
session
brew
is
the
sweetness
that
would
start
to
wear
on
the
palate
after
two
beers
some
potential
as
a
session
beer
very
drinkable
indeed
my
first
schwarzbier
so
i
was
not
quite
sure
what
to
expect
looking
through
the
bjcp
guidelines
i
think
boston
beer
companys
product
meets
all
the
requirements
fairly
strong
moderately
sweet
dark
roasted
malt
aroma
mixed
in
with
some
thick
chocolate
syrup
dense
foamy
hazelnut
colored
head
leaves
a
sheet
of
lace
deep
brown
colored
beer
with
a
cola
colored
hue
around
the
edges
dark
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
carries
over
into
the
mild
flavor
and
mixes
in
with
a
bit
of
marshmallow
dry
roasted
malt
finish
body
is
on
the
light
side
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
a
mix
between
soft
and
watery
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
dry
stout
quite
tasty
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
sam
it
was
slightly
fruitier
than
i
expected
which
didnt
make
it
bad
it
just
made
it
more
porter
like
im
glad
to
see
boston
beer
continue
to
make
seasonal
brews
instead
of
just
pushing
sam
light
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
schwarzbier
style
but
i
had
to
try
it
and
see
exactly
what
was
going
on
there
it
was
a
nice
blackamber
huge
with
a
small
light
brown
head
with
very
little
retention
but
it
presents
itself
well
sweet
smelling
with
chocolate
and
roasty
smells
a
nice
grainy
mouthfeel
and
nice
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
taste
with
a
hint
of
burnt
wood
very
very
impressed
i
will
definitely
pick
up
a
six
pack
again
soon
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
from
microsam
couldnt
get
porter
out
of
my
head
as
i
waited
for
the
beer
to
settle
still
kinda
cant
by
apperance
chocolatey
taste
then
nothing
very
hollow
this
is
the
type
of
beer
you
wont
mind
having
a
couple
ofbasically
just
to
get
rid
of
not
overly
disappointing
but
will
not
buy
again
certainly
drinakable
the
stout
character
is
tempered
by
its
lager
roots
part
of
the
brewmasters
pack
i
wish
i
could
get
the
scottish
ale
againanyways
pours
a
near
black
but
with
some
ruby
highlights
thru
out
some
bitter
chocolate
deep
roasted
grain
in
the
aromas
just
smells
sweet
taste
of
chocolate
and
sweet
caramel
with
heavily
roasted
malt
but
the
caramel
sweetness
almost
becomes
cloying
after
awhile
wow
sa
wasnt
playin
around
here
making
a
real
sweet
scharzbier
here
would
have
like
a
little
more
drier
balance
liek
others
i
have
tried
of
the
stylewell
to
each
there
own
included
in
the
recent

dark

with

highlights
in

minimally

side
of

but
not

done
glazed
pork

sweetened
by
a

impact
medium
mouthfeel
but
lively
carbonation
flavor
is
pleasant
balanced
by
dusty
hop
and
a
mild
astringency
however
malts
win
the
day
early
with
chocolate
infused
whole
grains
and
caramelized
sugar
comes
off
as
a
drinkable
brew
to
me
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
in
early
impression
and
aroma
d
definitely
a
unique
style
of
beer
i
expect
a
stout
but
it
has
a
very
smooth
lager
taste
it
is
a
refreshing
change
from
porters
and
stouts
but
i
still
enjoy
those
styles
more
frequently
this
is
a
great
beer
i
bought
a
sample
pack
with
black
lager
hefeweizen
and
boston
lager
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
bunch
pours
dark
like
a
porter
with
a
nice
head
malty
in
aroma
and
taste
with
a
touch
of
caramel
great
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
transition
beer
one
going
from
a
light
pilsner
or
lager
to
a
darker
fuller
more
flavorful
beer
i
definitely
recommend
this
anyone
poured
into
an
imperial
pint

12
brown

above
the
very
dark
mahogany
brew
head
fades
holds
its
own
and

aroma
is
hearty
dark
malts
with
a
slight
associated
bitterness
taste
is
just
what
the
nose
portended
dark
malt
bitter
aftertaste
lurks
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
pleasantly
thin
but
not
too
much
just
right
and
drinkability
is
excellent
hope
this
one
finds
a
permanent
place
in
their
lineup
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
sas
boston
lager
but
i
did
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
roasty
malty
a
little
bit
of
smoke
flavor
in
this
nice
and
smooth
lager
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
of
a
lager
with
a
dark
roasted
malt
color
interesting
experience
since
you
expect
a
beer
of
this
color
to
be
heavy
and
full
flavored
lightly
hopped
and
crisp
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
more
bitter
character
if
the
malts
were
a
little
darker
roasted
i
e
black
patent
the
body
is
light
and
glassy
as
expected
this
is
one
of
sas
best
brews
lets
hope
this
beer
is
successful
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
and
has
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
and
coffee
definitely
a
lot
of
malt
in
here
the
flavor
is
exceptionally
balanced
there
is
no
really
overpowering
flavor
a
nice
meld
of
the
coffee
tones
from
the
roasted
malt
and
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
as
smooth
as
any
fine
chocolate
beer
but
balanced
in
a
way
that
it
does
not
become
cloying
at
all
the
label
says
it
all
when
it
comes
to
the
finish
smooth
spicy
and
very
clean
for
all
of
the
flavors
going
on
here
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
hope
it
becomes
a
regular
in
the
bbc
lineup
i
gotta
say
its
a
good
beer
could
down
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
its
light
which
belies
its
taste
and
color
which
i
am
aware
isnt
always
typical
anyway
it
is
a
delicious
brew
and
one
of
the
best
sam
offers
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
sweet
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
and
a
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
an
extremely
dry
dark
malt
flavor
which
is
rich
in
pale
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
an
earthy
dry
lager
yeast
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
schwarzbier
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
dry
but
overall
its
a
fine
offering
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
rare
beers
that
is
best
enjoyed
in
the
bottle
to
keep
those
metallic
odors
bottled
up
i
really
wanted
to
give
a
higher
taste
score
but
the
smell
dragged
it
down
too
much
for
me
affecting
drinkability
as
well
it
is
an
otherwise
delicious
beer
worth
a
sixer
pours
an
almostblack
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
head
retention
was
pretty
good
and
there
was
excellent
lacing
the
smell
is
full
of
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
its
smooth
as
silk
despite
the
carbonation
the
taste
consists
of
chocolate
and
coffee
elements
that
blend
seamlessly
into
the
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
bitterness
is
at
a
perfect
level
countering
the
smooth
sweetness
of
the
beer
without
decreasing
drinkability
this
is
a
delicious
extremely
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
spend
all
night
with
very
easy
to
drink
nice
smooth
finish
and
great
flavors
i
still
stick
to
my
stouts
and
bitters
but
not
a
bad
alternative
now
and
then
served
at
cellar
temperature
deep
chestnut
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
fat
thick
head
of
beige
foam
about
a
quarter
inch
high
that
hangs
in
there
aroma
is
deep
and
rich
roasted
malts
cocoa
leather
and
smoke
flavor
is
roasty
with
dark
malts
chocolatey
not
bitter
not
sweet
no
noticeable
hop
presence
body
is
light
but
mouthfeel
is
even
round
and
full
sheets
of
lacey
legs
slide
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
pleasant
surprise
from
ol
sam
a
dark
brown
black
beer
with
deep
mahogony
highlights
has
a
small
dark
beige
there
is
a
deep
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
coffee
background
a
prickely
carbonation
opens
the
way
for
the
warm
roasted
malt
flavor
to
cover
your
tongue
there
is
a
coffee
like
bitterness
on
the
finish
good
offernig
pick
some
up
this
is
an
easy
drinking
well
balanced
malty
beer
although
i
was
looking
for
some
more
smoky
flavor
i
had
to
go
to
three
different
stores
before
i
found
it
looks
like
it
may
be
a
new
favorite
for
many
people
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
brewmasters
collection
offering
i
give
them
credit
for
a
solid
attempt
at
a
swarzbier
but
ill
stick
to
kostritzer
for
about
1
00
or
so
more
a
6
pk
but
not
much
tops
einbecker
overall
this
one
is
a
nice
session
brew
thats
packed
with
flavour
and
is
hearty
without
moving
outside
of
the
style
well
done
being
new
to
the
style
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
for
some
reason
i
thought
schwarzbiers
were
lighter
bodied
this
is
definitely
one
i
can
come
back
to
this
beer
is
the
best
of
both
worlds
its
a
damn
fine
porter
and
a
fine
stout
the
flavor
is
more
like
a
good
stout
but
where
the
stout
harshness
would
normaly
begin
the
porter
sweetness
kicks
in
this
could
become
my
normal
stock
of
beer
in
the
fridge
poured
a
dark
brown
decent
head
that
slowly
diminished
leaving
a
nice
rich
collar
all
the
way
through
hints
of
chocolate
in
the
aroma
but
not
a
very
strong
aroma
taste
is
of
chocolate
and
coffee
fairly
rich
and
pleasant
bit
of
sweetness
smooth
and
creamy
moderately
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
i
wanted
to
make
my
100th
review
something
special
like
st
bernadus
but
i
wasnt
able
to
get
to
that
store
tonight
and
my
eagerness
to
get
my
100th
review
in
won
out
so
there
it
is
i
hope
ive
learned
a
bit
by
now
well
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
worth
a
try
cheers
black
in
color
but
reveales
some
dark
brown
slightly
red
translucent
big
tan
head
retention
is
not
the
best
but
fades
to
leave
a
small
creamy
head
with
lots
of
foam
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
rich
with
toasted
malt
and
strong
chocolate
and
medium
hops
presence
taste
is
very
roasted
and
slightly
carmel
no
flavors
are
overwhelming
and
the
sweetness
stops
just
short
of
cloying
maybe
a
little
too
much
for
a
schwarzbier
but
still
not
bad
sam
adams
is
very
good
at
introducing
good
new
product
this
is
no
exception
pours
a
dark
chocolate
with
a
decent
head
and
lacing
smell
is
smoky
malt
with
coffee
undertones
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
slightly
tart
finish
hint
of
chocolate
is
also
present
mouthfeel
is
very
stout
like
with
a
nice
dry
feel
and
great
dry
finish
very
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
refreshing
with
that
great
dry
finish
pours
a
rich
chocolate
brown
with
a
reasonable
light
khaki
head
aroma
is
of
toffee
and
chocolate
smells
rich
and
creamy
taste
follows
aroma
nice
rich
toffee
notes
kinda
like
a
subtle
heath
bar
with
chocolate
and
toffee
notes
a
little
sweet
and
perhaps
a
little
lacking
in
hops
to
balance
but
seems
to
be
on
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
drinkability
is
good
but
i
dont
think
i
could
do
more
than
a
couple
due
to
the
suiteness
a
good
solid
brew
from
sam
adams
i
really
wish
they
would
but
this
in
a
6
pack
instead
of
the
mixed
six
with
the
weak
hefe
my
friend
seems
to
think
that
sa
got
the
idea
for
this
when
they
were
contract
brewed
at
fx
matt
and
ripped
off
from
black
forest
this
is
much
richer
than
that
overall
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
sa
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
surprise
and
one
that
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
usuals
roster
now
if
i
can
only
find
it
in
6packs
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
tan
head
great
head
retention
sweet
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
some
coffee
come
out
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
sweeter
than
i
would
prefere
but
either
way
is
was
fine
with
me
chocolate
carmel
and
some
hop
flavor
mabey
the
hops
could
have
been
stronger
but
the
bottle
did
say
lightly
hopped
had
a
medium
kind
of
silky
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
would
buy
it
agian
nice
to
see
sa
continue
to
produce
quality
seasonals
to
go
with
their
popular
standards
poured
a
dark
brown
tinged
with
a
bit
of
garnet
that
looks
nearly
black
when
the
glass
is
full
the
head
and
lace
were
adequate
the
taste
was
excellent
with
an
underlying
sweetness
balancing
the
dark
malt
flavors
of
chocolate
caramel
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
coffee
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
is
covered
well
by
this
beers
distinctive
feature
which
is
the
pleasing
length
of
the
dark
blend
of
roasted
flavors
this
lager
has
a
nice
dark
cola
color
with
a
pretty
decent
tan
head
the
head
collapses
fairly
quickly
but
laces
the
glass
well
the
smell
is
very
inviting
the
main
scent
is
chocolate
the
taste
is
also
full
of
chocolate
its
not
too
sweet
and
not
hoppy
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
when
i
first
poured
it
mouthfeel
is
where
i
was
afraid
it
would
disappoint
but
it
did
not
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
great
beer
to
share
with
those
people
who
are
afraid
of
anything
darker
than
mgd
it
might
open
their
eyes
as
a
style
that
i
love
for
its
character
as
well
as
its
drinkability
this
come
up
partially
short
it
has
some
flair
and
upside
but
its
limited
by
a
heavyhanded
undying
sweetness
and
thus
is
a
chore
to
drink
in
succession
drinkability
notes
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
to
this
i
tad
too
sweet
for
my
liking
either
way
its
a
delicious
beer
very
decent
schwarz
sam
adams
recent
offerings
this
their
vienna
lager
and
holiday
porter
etc
have
almost
all
very
good
and
excellent
examples
of
their
styles
the
boston
beer
company
can
certainly
make
a
good
beer
when
they
try
pours
out
a
deep
dark
brown

a
nice
full

headskie
full
roasty
flavor
with
thin
mouthfeel
hop
balance
is
there
but
not
perfect
this
is
a
very
decent
lager
worth
checking
out
it
is
so
good
to
see

then
a

is
well
felt
and
mouthfeel

medium
like
a

decent
brew
i
could
have
two
but
to
be
honest
if
you
told
me
it
was
a
porter
id
never
know
otherwise
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
perhaps
before
their
flagship
brand
but
after
the
boston
ale
its
worth
a
shot
but
if
it
is
a
porter
you
are
looking
for
get
a
porter
this
will
disappoint
on
that
count
but
definatly
worth
a
try
once
again
sam
adams
gives
a
good
solid
if
not
spectacular
effort
this
has
to
be
the
best
drinking
black
lager
in
texas
i
literally
pounded
back
a
pint
of
this
the
other
day
it
was
like
i
just
got
done
running
a
5k
and
slammed
a
gatorade
one
of
the
most
sessionable
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
well
done
but
im
not
surprised
live
oak
makes
some
of
the
finest
beers
in
tx
im
new
to
this
style
so
i
dont
have
any
way
to
compare
it
to
any
other
versions
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
different
ones
in
the
future
all
in
all
i
love
live
oak
i
get
a
nuanced
roasty
aroma
thats
on
the
light
side
with
a
wonderful
caramel
malt
profile
coming
across
the
flavor
has
a
nice
roast
profile
to
it
as
well
with
a
light
hop
bittering
and
a
delectable
body
this
lacks
the
cloyingly
sweet
flavor
and
heavy
body
that
i
find
unwanted
in
my
schwarzbier
yet
theres
just
enough
sweetness
to
round
it
out
and
a
flavor
which
holds
up
even
as
it
warms
wonderful
perhaps
the
closest
beer
to
a
death
taxes
ive
had
in
texas
bravo
live
oak
bravo
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
as
well
as
some
very
light
smoke
and
some
light
chocolate
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
as
well
as
some
chalky
powdery
chocolate
and
some
grain
notes
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
another
delicious
beer
from
live
oak
possibly
the
best
brewer
of
german
and
czech
style
beers
in
the
us
every
time
lo
brews
a
new
beer
they
do
it
superbly
and
if
you
can
do
the
simple
things
to
perfection
youre
doing
every
bit
as
well
as
someone
who
goes
for
the
weird
and
esoteric
lo
hefe
lo
pilz
treehugger
big
bark
and
now
this
what
a
joy
to
be
living
in
the
same
town
overall
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
was
disappointed
to
only
have
one
growler
to
split
another
excellent
german
interpretation
form
live
oak
maybe
the
bet
non
german
brewery
making
german
beer
in
the
us
get
some
if
you
see
it
just
had
the
new
live
oak
spring
seasonal
on
tap
at
the
pub
we
work
at
it
pours
an
opaque
black
but
in
the
light
it
reveals
ruby
red
undertones
the
smell
has
flowery
and
spicy
notes
in
addition
to
the
maltiness
smell
the
taste
is
very
nice
it
has
a
hoppiness
that
isnt
too
bitter
and
is
well
balanced
with
the
roasted
malts
the
feel
is
relatively
smooth
with
a
nice
dry
finish
this
is
the
first
schwarzbier
weve
had
so
we
dont
have
a
lot
to
compare
too
but
overall
we
thought
it
was
a
very
well
done
beer
overall
super
solid
stuff
here
maybe
a
touch
sweet
for
me
but
a
very
well
made
beer
othis
was
different
than
i
expected
it
to
be
but
it
really
grew
on
me
and
was
very
enjoyable

and
there
was

the

wasnt

this

again
this
started
to

i

i

7
easy
drinking
for
a
big
coffee
beer
i
think
the
lagering
process
is
responsible
for
that
almost
no
bitterness
at
all
which
is
surprising
given
the
coffee
i
give
it
extra
points
for
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
but
i
wasnt
really
a
fan
of
the
flavors
on
the
whole
not
sure
if
the
coffee
works
quite
right
in
a
schwarzbier
maybe
i
prefer
the
bitterness
of
your
typical
coffee
beer
not
really
sure
a
bit
underwhelming
for
me
not
bad
but
there
is
no
brutality
to
brewtality
yeah
i
thought
of
that
all
by
myself
this
is
worth
checking
out
but
is
no
means
the
best
coffee
brew
around
but
to
be
fair
i
like
bitter
ass
burnt
as
shit
coffee
like
only
starbucks
dark
roast
or
brooklyn
gorilla
stuff
so
keep
that
in
mind
when
i
talk
about
coffee
i
drink
it
with
maybe
some
milk
usually
skim
and
no
sugar
that
doesnt
make
me
bad
ass
it
is
just
the
way
i
like
coffee
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
that
is
opaque
in
the
glass
with
a
half
finger
brown
head
that
dissipates
slowly
to
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
of
quality
coffee
toasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
alchohol
flavor
is
wow
rich
latte
coffee
toasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
liqueur
wonderfully
integrated
finishes
with
sweet
coffee
light
lactose
licorice
and
sweet
dark
malt
creamy
medium
to
heavy
bodied
this
is
a
beautifully
made
coffee
ale
with
great
balance
of
flavors
the
alcohol
in
the
aroma
is
well
covered
in
the
taste
but
this
is
warming
and
warm
if
a
great
bartender
made
a
mixed
drink
out
of
a
well
made
light
stout
and
a
quality
coffee
liqueur
this
is
how
i
imagine
it
would
turn
out
this
could
be
my
favorite
coffee
beer
ive
ever
had
well
done
and
recommended
not
available
in
seattle
but
bought
this
in
southern
california
most
midnight
sun
is
available
here
hope
some
fall
off
the
truck
on
the
way
down
next
year
beer
distribution
is
so
utterly
weird
atmosphere
is
really
nice
slight
head
effervescence
and
slight
yet
persistent
lacing
nose
is
coffee
black
licorice
dark
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
char
roasted
coffee
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
a
nice
balance
of
licorice
and
molasses
boozy
with
a
bit
of
a
peaty
finish
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
this
is
a
really
memorable
and
unique
creation
probably
one
of
the
best
coffeeinfused
beers
too
on
the
lower
end
of
medium
body
with
tight
carbonation
and
a
bitter
deeply
roasted
espressocoffee
bean
flavor
that
dominates
the
palate
doesnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
with
a
light
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
and
slightly
one
dimensional
flavor
profile
dry
and
bitter
with
a
slightly
burnt
acrid
espresso
flavor
with
hints
of
smoke
charcoal
barbecued
meat
and
burnt
toast
under
all
of
the
roast
there
is
some
nice
coffee
flavor
and
sweeter
chocolate
malt
notes
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
but
its
still
a
bit
too
harsh
and
roastedburnt
tasting
for
my
preference
this
review
is
a
bit
of
a
love
letter
to
one
of
my
favorite
beers
essentially
this
beer
is
a
double
espresso
in
beer
form
but
it
is
so
much
more
than
that
the
beer
looks
fantastic
jet
black
in
color
but
not
terribly
thick
w
a
coffee
tan
head
that
lingers
down
the
entire
glass
the
smell
is
the
only
thing
that
isnt
perfect
for
me
faint
coffee
and
chocolate
scents
but
it
is
nothing
powerful
like
the
taste
full
of
rich
dark
french
roast
coffee
transitioning
to
a
mocha
flavor
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
and
surprisingly
dry
and
smooth
the
alcohol
is
totally
hidden
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
also
masterful
not
much
carbonation
which
is
perfect
for
a
coffee
beer
and
the
schwarzbier
aspect
is
what
gives
this
beer
a
light
feel
making
it
the
most
refreshing
black
beer
ive
ever
had
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
and
anyone
who
likes
coffee
and
beer
should
try
to
hunt
it
down
o
an
interesting
beer
which
marries
espresso
and
malt
while
leaving
out
the
hop
bitterness
in
a
hop
dominate
craft
brew
world
this
beer
is
interesting
and
refreshing
o
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
definitely
the
best
schwarzbier
that
i
have
ever
had
wonderful
flavors
and
aromas
of
coffee
o
this
beer
is
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
for
lovers
of
coffee
beers
as
it
drinks
smooth
and
has
virtually
no
bitterness
or
roasted
flavors
it
also
hides
its
alcohol
rather
well
d
nice
big
schwarzbier
great
balance
o
coffee
lager
yes
please
very
smooth
and
tasty
pours
a
thin
looking
deep
brown
with
a
small
light
brown
head
smells
of
red
grapes
plum
and
raisins
taste
is
very
sweet
up
front
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
some
slight
smoke
flavor
and
goes
down
with
a
light
espresso
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thiner
side
with
pretty
low
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
much
coffee
going
on
but
still
very
good
i
stand
by
my
review
not
much
if
any
coffee
flavor
the
beer
itself
is
good
but
i
dont
get
much
coffee
at
all
thus
my
grade
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
coffee
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
really
nice
coffee
flavor
and
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
extremely
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
was
expecting
something
quite
different
when
i
saw
this
was
listed
as
a
schwarzbier
but
the
sweetness
here
is
just
a
bit
overwhelming
o
an
amazing
intense
incredibly
flavorful
beer
a
really
interesting
take
on
the
coffee
beer
it
would
perhaps
be
even
better
if
it
toned
down
the
sweetness
just
a
touch
but
its
already
wonderful
as
is
unique
interesting
tasty
but
not
mindblowing
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
may
be
too
much
for
some
but
i
love
the
way
it
offsets
the
stronger
coffee
notes
another
great
brew
from
midnight
sun
o
overall
this
was
a
delicious
beer
excellent
coffee
notes
just
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
still
well
executed
o
overall
im
pretty
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
had
no
expectations
coming
into
this
just
that
it
was
newly
out
of
retirement
and
appeared
locally
from
one
of
the
better
breweries
to
recently
hit
new
york
this
is
quite
a
surprise
and
really
an
out
of
this
world
beer
i
will
be
picking
up
additional
bottles
of
this
o
the
only
german
black
beer
bier
ive
had
som
my
flavor
comparisons
are
mostly
from
american
black
ales
as
well
as
ales
from
the
porter
and
stout
family
i
thought
it
a
nice
beer
a
lager
based
on
the
label
thinner
than
the
american
versions
which
are
ales
but
just
as
formidable
i
drank
it
slightly
colder
than
i
would
an
ale
supposing
it
appropriate
it
nicely
melded
that
light
lager
fell
with
darker
more
complex
and
rich
flavors
overall
i
would
like
to
shake
this
jeremiahs
hand
when
beerfiend
sent
me
this
a
while
back
i
had
never
even
heard
of
it
it
sat
in
my
parents
basement
for
a
year
before
i
was
finally
able
to
open
it
and
holly
christmas
was
this
ever
good
i
dont
know
if
the
extra
year
of
age
improved
the
beer
or
not
but
this
is
drinking
superbly
right
now
lots
of
big
bold
stoutlike
flavors
that
i
love
with
a
full
creamy
palate
to
support
it
a
wonderful
finish
on
this
one
as
well
making
it
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
i
polished
off
this
bomber
in
record
time
and
was
checking
my
basement
for
more
disappointed
i
moved
on
to
something
much
worse
thanks
again
akbeerfiend
this
was
outstanding
o
solid
beer
although
it
was
kind
of
a
srange
combination
not
bad
i
liked
it
but
didnt
love
it
overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
straddles
the
lines
of
many
styles
would
not
mind
having
another
at
all
pours
a
dark
almost
black
beer
with
a
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
roasty
maybe
black
patent
and
chocolate
malt
light
sweetness
on
the
nose
taste
heavy
chocolate
roast
and
espresso
kaladi
brothers
its
almost
as
if
you
had
a
mocha
in
beer
form
heavy
raw
malted
barley
flavor
palate
full
bodied
tons
of
residual
sugars
with
a
crisp
lager
finish
d
not
bad
at
all
a
bit
higher
in
alcohol
than
i
was
expecting
but
at
least
it
wasnt
boozy
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
brown
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
of
tan
head
and
left
some
frothy
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
filled
with
espresso
notes
chocolate
malts
roastiness
vanilla
beans
and
slight
caramel
notes
like
the
nose
the
espresso
character
dominated
the
taste
long
with
chocolate
malts
caramel
and
roasty
accents
it
also
had
grinded
down
coffee
bean
and
vanilla
bean
notes
mid
palate
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
chocolatey
slight
astringent
roasty
creamy
and
mild
dry
finish
it
drank
really
good
and
was
really
tasty
it
was
one
of
my
favorite
from
the
brew
crew
series
reviewed
from
notes
thanks
to
alex
for
bringing
this
poured
into
a
tulip
color
is
opaque
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
good
retention
and
some
lacing
smell
is
chocolate
espresso
raw
grains
and
molasses
bitter
coffee
dominates
the
flavor
followed
by
some
hops
roasted
malts
some
sweetness
and
finishes
with
more
coffee
medium
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
maybe
a
bit
high
on
the
abv
for
the
style
although
the
alcohol
was
not
present
in
the
flavor
or
smell
probably
a
bit
more
coffee
bitterness
then
i
would
have
liked
for
the
style
a
good
beer
but
probably
not
the
best
schwarz
i
have
had
although
it
definitley
falls
in
my
top
5
coffee
lagers
thanks
again
alex
i
like
sweet
but
this
might
have
been
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
would
really
have
liked
to
have
tried
this
right
after
it
came
out
as
it
sounds
like
it
had
a
much
better
coffee
presence
but
as
always
a
very
good
beer
from
ms
and
one
of
the
better
black
lagers
ive
tasted
in
awhile
d
yum
got
my
coffee
fix
along
with
a
nice
malty
beer
if
youre
into
malts
and
coffee
this
is
your
beer
recommend
this
has
the
makings
of
a
good
beer
but
theres
something
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
that
i
dont
like
d
probably
not
something
of
which
i
could
drink
a
ton
but
definitely
quite
enjoyable
best
coffee
lager
ive
ever
had
and
highly
flavorful
albeit
a
touch
monochromatic
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
one
of
the
better
coffee
showcase
beers
out
there
as
the
other
flavors
augment
rather
than
overpower
well
worth
a
shot
awesome
for
the
style
would
like
to
have
tried
this
fresh
but
am
impressed
with
this
even
with
a
year
or
more
on
it
pouring
black
with
a
dense
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
this
is
one
good
looking
beer
the
nose
is
wonderful
chocolate
roast
and
coffee
all
excellently
balanced
the
coffee
has
a
lot
of
depth
to
it
with
a
nice
richness
this
translates
to
the
palate
as
well
with
the
blend
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roast
being
quite
harmonious
quite
unlike
any
other
schwarzbier
ive
had
but
still
very
good
again
i
cant
stress
enough
how
much
depth
there
was
to
the
coffee
flavor
rich
creamy
with
moderate
bitterness
and
a
nice
dark
chocolate
finish
this
beer
is
quite
excellent
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
far
out
of
the
norm
for
the
style
but
an
enjoyable
beer
one
that
i
drank
multiple
pours
of
overall
very
unique
and
interesting
the
sour
spice
is
a
nice
touch
whatever
it
is
probably
oughta
be
sipped
but
the
flavors
keep
the
sips
coming
at
short
intervals
a
good
beer
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
and
you
probably
wont
d
great
this
is
a
wonderful
coffee
beer
one
that
the
coffee
beer
lovers
must
seek
out
tasty
stuff
drinkability
is
very
good
a
great
coffee
beer
split
with
my
dad
we
savored
ever
drop
my
first
strong
dark
larger
a
true
hybrid
with
both
great
vision
and
execution
really
happy
i
got
to
try
this
thanks
again
jeremiah
black
and
completely
opaque
with
a
thin
cap
of
dark
tan
espresso
on
the
nose
thats
about
it
no
real
malt
to
speak
of
just
intensely
overpowering
espresso
its
nicely
expressed
however
and
doesnt
smell
like
a
stale
cup
of
coffee
the
flavor
is
equally
coffeeforward
but
the
base
beer
thankfully
shines
through
a
bit
more
chocolatey
malt
light
bittering
hops
and
a
touch
of
molasses
shine
past
the
punchy
espresso
flavor
though
just
barely
bitter
semidry
finish
solid
standout
brew
and
very
good
for
style
44
5444
honestly
this
one
really
blew
me
away
though
my
love
of
coffee
in
beer
probably
contributed
a
good
bit
its
certainly
the
most
original
and
probably
the
best
schwarzbier
ive
had
just
another
great
beer
from
midnight
sun
and
im
really
excited
about
the
new
series
overall
defenitely
a
good
first
signature
brew
for
jeremiah
although
slightly
one
dimensional
that
dimension
is
the
one
you
want
in
a
coffeeespresso
brew
coffee
if
you
are
a
coffee
beer
fan
do
not
miss
out
on
this
one
a
respectable
kickoff
to
the
2009
crew
brews
looks
like
yet
another
classic
series
from
the
crew
at
midnight
sun
excited
to
see
what
gabe
and
yukon
cornelius
come
up
with
anyway
a
good
espresso
beer
and
good
start
to
the
series
get
some
and
chug0lug0yo
coffee
mug
this
is
a
very
average
lager
not
bad
and
it
is
an
easy
drinker
smelled
and
tasted
bad
drain
pour
i
dont
quite
know
whats
going
on
here
but
this
is
not
the
blackened
voodoo
i
remember
from
56
years
ago
and
its
definitely
not
a
schwarzbier
the
beer
i
remember
was
much
darker
and
had
a
roastier
profile
though
still
sweet
while
this
is
paler
and
more
onedimensional
more
like
a
marzen
really
its
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
pours
a
dark
amber
color
you
would
think
with
a
name
like
blackened
it
would
be
darker
was
disappointed
in
this
smell
and
taste
is
your
typical
lager
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
especially
compared
to
what
im
used
to
wanted
to
revisit
this
one
remember
beers
of
the
world
kinda
reminds
me
of
newcastle
i
like
the
constant
bubbly
right
on
the
edge
of
being
too
much
but
doesnt
cross
it
you
can
keep
all
that
belgian
or
ipa
swill
me
likes
basic
lager
nothing
new
here
at
all
pours
clear
and
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
style
deep
amber
brilliant
with
clarity
and
a
fat
head
of
tan
creamy
foam
that
lasts
a
surprisingly
long
time
and
leaves
lace
nose
is
rich
with
toasty
malt
nothing
burnt
nothing
roasted
no
coffee
or
chocolate
there
is
a
luscious
caramel
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
faintly
on
the
nose
is
a
tad
and
i
do
mean
just
a
tad
of
green
apple
its
perfect
for
the
style
and
that
hint
of
apple
really
adds
brightness
there
is
also
the
modest
whiff
of
noble
hops
but
nothing
really
to
even
talk
about
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
there
is
a
richness
and
depth
to
the
malt
that
is
very
pleasant
bready
with
a
bit
of
the
crust
deep
and
complex
sweetness
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
green
apple
is
so
faint
in
the
drink
but
provides
a
bit
of
crispness
the
hops
lean
on
to
the
palate
a
bit
in
the
finish
with
a
low
amount
of
bitterness
this
finishes
with
a
little
residual
sweetness
my
only
complaint
about
this
beer
is
that
it
finished
with
brown
sugar
and
caramel
to
the
point
of
being
a
bit
too
sweet
rather

the
breadier

linger
pours
a
transparent
tan
with
good
head
and
nice
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
tastes
the
same
with
plenty
of
malt
and
bread
sugar
residual
seems
to
be
a
little
heavy
on
this
one
and
causes
the
balance
to
be
off
with
this
lager
nice
dark
lager
with
a
pinch
of
spice
the
base
is
smooth
slightly
sweet
lager
with
a
strong
roasted
overtone
the
color
it
more
red
than
black
with
little
to
no
head
and
light
carbonation
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
o
all
malt
dark
lager
is
not
my
thing
but
this
was
o
k
despite
the
smell
overall
i
enjoyeed
this
beer
but
the
sweet
boozy
flavor
does
not
serve
it
well
o
better
than
many
beers
that
prominently
state
lager
not
to
be
at
all
biased
against
lagers
but
nothing
memorable
stands
out
a
lager
should
move
and
hold
well
but
this
seems
to
have
gone
bad
or
it
was
always
funky
bob
avoid
this
pours
a
pretty
cinnamon
amber
in
color

spotty

each
sip
the
aroma
is

nice

roasted

caramel
and
toffee
with
brown

sweetness
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
smooth
with
the
above
flavors
mixing
well
together
then
followed
by
the
brown
sugar
sweetness
finish
perfect
carbonation
this
is
a
different
brew
but
tasty
and
has
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
really
liked
this
one
overall
this
was
really
good
but
its
downfall
may
be
its
massive
sweetness
great
flavor
though
beeradvocate
lists
this
beer
as
a
schwarzbier
but
considering
the
lack
of
roasted
flavors
e
g
coffee
chocolate
that
are
associated
with
schwarzbiers
i
think
it
makes
more
sense
to
consider
blackened

as
a

blues
club
suggested
this
one
to
me
drank
straight
out
of
the
bottle
so
was
not
able
to
see
the
color
boy
was
i
surprised
when
i
got
home
and
found
out
it
was
from
louisiana
ales
are
my
norm
but
i
enjoyed
this
interesting
voodoo
perhaps
it
was
the
setting
of
the
blues
club
but
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
will
look
for
it
again
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
from
the
style
and
to
me
it
tasted
more
like
a
brown
ale
or
a
bock
i
think
it
missed
the
mark
for
the
style
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
not
too
filling
but
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
think
one
would
be
enough
for
me
i
have
no
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
they
werent
the
greatest
but
they
still
wound
up
being
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
off
it
was
for
the
style
this
beer
doesnt
even
compare
to
the
last
two
schwarzbiers
i
had
and
i
dont
think
i
would
guess
the
correct
style
if
i
tried
it
blindly
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
good
schwarzbier
since
i
dont
feel
like
it
does
a
good
job
representing
the
style
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
it
didnt
make
for
a
good
first
impression
for
dixie
brewing
company
it
was
pretty
a
forgettable
especially
for
the
style
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
beer
need
some
major
work
of
the
the
three
schwarzbiers
ive
tried
this
week
this
one
was
the
worst
and
it
wasnt
even
close
o
not
as
complex
or
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
schwarzbiers
that
i
have
tried
in
the
past
easy
enough
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
i
would
not
have
more
than
one
of
these
nice
round
warm
mouthfeel
a
good
brew
this
beer
has
the
most
unique
taste
i
have
tasted
and
it
has
a
lovely
smooth
taste
the
label
is
a
great
representation
for
the
name
of
the
beer
and
new
orleans
o
pretty
easy
drinking
unique
flavor
worth
a
try
better
than

not
real
fond
of
this
one
theres
enough
here
to
recommend
this

for
novice
schwarzbier
drinkers
but
for
those
with
the
practiced

the
alarms
are
more
subtle
here
than
usual
but
theyre
still
going
off
we
have
the

to
thank
for
bringing

smell
is
toasted

crackerlike
im
no

id
guess
thats
a

of
the
maillard

im
smelling
taste
followed
the
nose
sweet
and
toasted
malts
rounding
off
with
that
smooth
crisp
finish
of
a
schwarzbier
overall
i
was
apprehensive
at
how
different
it
looked
for
its
style
but
it
satisfied
just
fine
o
first
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
and
i
would
try
it
again
hard
to
distinguish
from
a
maerzen
i
have
to
wonder
if
dixies
beers
were
better
once
upon
a
time
as
this
one
is
really
disappointing
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with

foamy
dark
khaki
head

of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
some
slight
caramel
notes
taste
is
mainly
of
roasted
malt
with
a
caramel
sweetness
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
flavor
wise
but
i
think
the
smell
is
better
this
beer
pours
up
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
a
one
finger
taupe
head
and
some
residual
lacing
the
smell
is
mainly
roasted
nuts
and
apples
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
nothing
spectacular
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
and
the
front
end
the
finish
though
just
doesnt
overcome
the
malt
id
like
this
one
to
be
a
little
better
balanced
not
too
bad
overall
just
didnt
expect
it
to
be
as
sweet
as
it
is
o
an
excellent
dark
americanstyle
lager
easy
to
approach
and
good
for
most
any
occasion
proof
that
dark
is
not
a
flavor

woodyherbal
almost
minty
zesty
bitterness
in
finish
it
is
complex
lively
engaging
some
elements
are
hard
to
pin
down
overall
good
tasting
and
very
easy
drinking
this
makes
for
one
tasty
session
beer
a
better
than
average
black
lager
pours
actually
much
more
brown
than
black
surprisingly
see
through
for
the
style
with
a
medium
sized
off
white
head
the
smell
is
chocolate
malts
and
brown
sugar
very
sweet
smell
without
any
hops
unfortunately
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
but
mostly
just
the
dark
complexion
of
well
roasted
malts
and
semisweet
chocolate
there
is
a
soda
like
carbonation
and
a
very
creamy
feel
which
do
a
lot
for
this
beer
i
think
it
takes
some
of
the
sweetness
down
and
lets
the
flavors
of
the
malt
expand
a
bit
there
seems
to
be
something
missing
though
in
this
beer
and
for
me
it
was
hops
even
just
a
bit
to
bitter
up
the
finish
would
have
been
a
great
addition
i
wasnt
at
all
in
love
with
this
but
its
a
tolerable
brew
overall
this
beer
wasnt
bad
tasting
like
i
expected
the
problem
is
that
it
tasted
like
nothing
at
all
i
feel
like
i
am
drinking
uncarbonated
flavored
water
overall
a
lot
sweeter
than
anticipated
it
lacks
the
typically
dominant
dark
malt
character
of
most
schwarzbier
examples
possibly
a
bit
of
diacetyl
is
present
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
to
style
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
clear
dark
caramel
brown
with
a
tall
biege
head
there
are
a
few
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
bready
yeast
it
smells
slightly
sweet
but
also
clean
theres
a
malty
sweetness
to
this
beer
that
is
typical
for
dixie
its
malty
with
some
flavors
of
chocolate
and
the
yeast
there
are
some
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
but
the
flavor
is
rather
mild
the
aftertaste
is
mildly
astringent
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
and
the
carbonation
is
fairly
mild
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
is
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
tried
and
it
helped
get
me
started
down
the
road
towards
better
beer
even
though
the
old
brewery
is
no
longer
in
operation
in
new
orleans
i
still
raise
my
glass
to
dixie
decent
beer
thought
it
would
have
some
interesting
character
this
seemed
to
come
up

small
fizzy
head

of

a

the
taste
roasted

sweet
toffee
and
a
light
tang
confused
lemony
hop
profile
and
finishes
with
spritzy
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
overall
a
mainstream
lager
all
the
way
with
some
nice
malt
notes
could
be
cleaner
but
not
altogether
bad
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
light
enough
as
to
not
be
too
cloying
yet
with
lots
of
flavor
and
well
balanced
at
that
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
this
makes
a
good
brew
on
its
own
or
with
food
i
highly
recommend
this
one
and
say
this
is
another
great
job
by
the
dixie
brewing
co
cheers
o
i
expected
more
black
from
this
blackened

were

charred

finishes
a

abruptly
with
some

very
subdued
flavors
but
whats
there
is
sweet
well
integrated
and
pleasant
light
bodied
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
as
i
wasnt
expecting
much
i
wish
the
flavor
was
more
robust
and
had
a
better
finish
but
id
try
this
again
if
it
is
available
and
i
want
a
decent
low
abv
beer
that
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
overall
very
tasty
and
satisfying
brew
one
which
had
a
nice
bold
roasty
taste
to
it
although
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
this
one
was
quite
enjoyable
poured
out

coppery
amber
in
color

partial
haziness

collar

i
really
wish
the
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
was
fresher
flavor
has
the
aforementioned
stale
burnt
coffee
with
a
squeeze
of
prune
puree
and
a
strange
sort
of
offputting
acidity
that
rises
up
with
the
strangelysweet
for
the
style
finish
body
is
relatively
watery
and
thin
im
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
one
seems
as
though
it
could
use
more
hopping
or
at
least
a
lower
acridity
level
o
this
used
to
be
my
goto
beer
whenever
i
was
in
new
orleans
blackened
voodoo
turned
me
on
to
craft
beer
its
even
better
now
than
i
remembered
could
it
be
brewing
in
wisconsin
while
the
brewery
is
being
rebuilt
whatever
i
love
that
malty
taste
and
long
for
more
strolls
down
those
french
quarter
streets
this
one
definately
goes
into
my
rotation

a
pretty
tasty

to
be
a
schwarzbier

book

definitely
unique

be
drinking

bored

the
only
thing
i
would

is
the
label
overall
this
beer
has
met
and
exceeded
any
expectations
i
had
of
it
quite
a
decent
dark
lager
i
wouldnt
turn
down
if
offered
one
and
i
would
even
buy
a
six
pack
occasionally
i
suspect
this
beer
would
be
great
with
some
spicy
cajun
dishes
overall
definitely
a
decent
beer
that
was
quite
drinkable
however
it
just
wasnt
very
exciting
or
memorable
the
taste
is
well
balanced

i
wouldnt
turn
one
away
if
offered
poured
from
the
bottle
into

the

its

me
of
a
light
lager
light
straw
colored
light
body
light

really
light

around

with
this
sweet
finish
to
it
not
cloyingly
sweet
but
definitely
noticeable
dominating
even
i
could
picture
sucking
down
three
or
four
of
these
on
a
steamy
seamy
night
but
for
now
ill
stick
to
just
one
notes
i
was
surprised
to
discover
id
never
reviewed
this
beer
before
as
about
14
maybe
15
years
ago
mrmojorisin
used
to
show
up
at
my
apartment
in
guilderland
ny
with
loads
of
this
beer
it
was
one
of
my
earlier
craft
beers
and
we
used
to
drink
plenty
of
it
while
listening
to
tunes
grilling
and
hanging
out
good
times
good
beer
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
not
as
good
as
the
other
kind
i
had
abita
turbodog
surprised
by
this
highly
drinkable
lightyetmalty
beer
very
similar
to
a
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
i
am
an
instant
fan
of
this
brew
overall
it
is
a
good
lager
and
took
me
wholly
by
surprise
i
still
feel
like
voodoo
has
missed
an
opportunity
to
make
a
a
truly
fantastic
brew
the
flavors
should
be
just
a
bit
big
bigger
and
so
should
the
mouth
feel
a
little
less
wimp
and
this
would
have
been
a
ahem
magical
beer
the
cpj
it
has
a
roasted
malt
aroma
there
is
a
nice
offwhite
head
over
a
brown
body
the
flavor
is
strong
with
roasted
malt
with
a
chocolaty
bitterness
and
sweet
toffee
tones
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
metallic
there
is
a
bit
of
carbonation
burn
to
the
body
but
not
much
for
the
most
part
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
i
think
this
is
one
of
their
better
beers
even
the
alcohol
barely
seemed
noticeable
here
im
sure
it
could
be
felt
after
a
few
of
these
were
downed
but
as
for
one
bottle
the
flavors
and
attempt
at
spice
are
pretty
mellow
as
well
as
all
that
one
will
feel
from
this
while
this
isnt
anything
outstanding
its
crafted
well
enough
that
even
the
novice
beer
drinker
will
enjoy
this
as
this
beer
is
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
overall
drinkability
great
light
body
but
still
strong
and
flavorful
beer
with
some
balance
of
hop
and
malt
characters
good
easy
drinkin
light
body
dark
beer
o
my
buddy
who
is
not
a
big
craft
brew
guy
wanted
me
to
try
this
because
its
one
of
his
favorite
beers
i
laughed
and
said
sure
why
not
i
really
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
i
was
actually
surprised
on
how
much
i
liked
it
its
not
a
bad
beer
probably
would
not
seek
it
out
but
its
not
bad
beer
is
a
little
more
buttery
than
i
remember
it
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
slightly
the
finish
is
mild
and
not
too
bitter
i
guess
im
bored
not
too
interesting
overall
oh
well
toss
up
between
c
and
b
is
there
a
b
like
a
2
75
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
to
try
very
tasty
and
flavorful
poured
from
a
standard
bottle
into
a
glass
beer
was
just
average
not
much
smell
or
notable
flavor
profile
actually
quite
bland
although
a
little
spicy
small
head
after
pour
but
not
much
lacing
color
was
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
smooth
mouthfeel
maybe
its
because
i
prefer
ales
to
lagers
but
i
was
not
impressed
overall
great
not
entirely
sure
it
should
be
a
schwarzbier
id
call
it
a
spiced
beer
but
hey
its
good
o
decent
3
5
this
brew
pours
out
at
a
dark
brown
similar
to
a
cola
color
the
head
is
a
tan
color
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
roasted
with
some
grassy
lager
aromas
lingering
in
the
background
the
taste
reminds
me
or
a
becks
dark
a
little
bit
its
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
but
kind
of
sweet
upfront
with
a
toasted
caramel
flavor
the
mouthfeel
isnt
heavy
its
actually
on
the
lighter
side
overall
its
an
interesting
brew
but
not
something
id
buy
a
case
of
i
think
that
this
is
mislabeled
as
a
schwarzbier
cause
it
makes
a
mighty
fine
dunkel
not
too
bad
for
the
price
either
o
overall
not
too
bad
and
great
as
a
session
beer
but
with
a
name
like
blackened
voodoo
i
was
expecting
something
more
12oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
offwhite
head
decent
carbonation
aroma
has
some
caramel
syrup
and
corn
taste
is
sweet
like
caramel
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
note
and
some
light
bittering
hops
on
the
end
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
finish
is
slightly
bitter
the
caramel
sweetness
makes
this
one
work
for
me
although
the
metallic
aspect
loses
it
some
points
really
not
a
bad
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
yeah
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
i
would
rate
above
average
good
dark
beer
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
malty
somewhat
roasty
aroma
it
had
the
nice
beginnings
of
a
schwarzbier
in
the
nose
but
became
underwhelming
once
the
drinker
got
to
the
taste
it
was
loose
and
none
of
the
flavors
really
broke
out
to
give
any
boldness
of
flavor
o
a
nice
beer
very
drinkable
balanced
i
would
buy
it
again
overall
very
approachable
if
you
dont
mind
the
sweetness
a
schwarzbier
i
dont
think
so
o
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
its
not
particularly
memorable
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
but
its
has
a
little
bit
of
wateryness
to
it
thats
a
little
bit
disappointing
theres
really
not
much
else
to
write
beer
has
strong
toffee
smells
and
tastes
it
can
be
and
i
have
made
it
into
a
great
session
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
that
is
dark
enough
you
cant
see
through
the
glass
slight
carbonation
but
ends
rather
quickly
has
a
rather
decent
scent
of
some
roasted
malts
the
roasted
malt
taste
hits
your
tongue
right
away
for
an
overall
mild
taste
a
little
too
light
in
texture
considering
the
taste
drinks
rather
fast
with
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
certainly
worthy
d
its
not
really
my
style
but
its
fine
i
dont
think
its
necessarily
something
thats
worth
its
price
when
a
yeungling
black
and
tan
is
cheaper
and
about
the
same
im
not
entirely
sure
what
the
point
of
this
beer
is
it
is
named
like
a
40oz
malt
beverage
tastes
like
a
weak
black
lager
and
has
a
historical
significance
behind
it
but
i
really
do
not
know
what
it
is
telling
me
and
i
would
recommend
you
skip
it
of
the
beers
that
come
from
the
new
orleans
area
this
is
about
one
of
my
favorites
had
plenty
of
these
walking
down
canal
street
not
some
must
have
beer
but
a
fun
brew
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
like
what
i
expected
and
looked
forward
to
t
a
lot
of
malt
and
thats
pretty
much
it
slight
caramel
sweetness
a
bit
of
coffee
and
some
creaminess
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
in
here
for
me
i
felt
like
there
were
more
flavors
in
here
but
they
couldnt
escape
the
carbonation
finally
drinking
wise
the
beer
has
a
java
stout
taste
that
one
asks
dear
starbucks
may
i
recommend
adding
this
drink
to
your
menu
our
group
wasnt
sure
of
the
lager
label
given
to
the
beer
personally
i
found
the
combination
of
smell
and
flavor
to
be
the
real
killers
here
im
sure
this
beer
has
fans
but
i
am
not
one
and
i
cant
believe
the
average
beer
enthusiast
would
be
one
either
overall
it
strikes
me
as
a
session
beer
when
it
doesnt
need
to
be
mfd
a
lighter
body
on
this
one
which
is
on
par
with
the
style
as
well
as
the
carbonation
levels
and
how
well
the
flavors
linger
as
for
drinkability
its
an
ok
beer
but
not
up
there
with
the
better
examples
of
the
style
picked
this
up
for
my
wife
cause
she
remembered
drinking
it
in
new
orleans
in
the
mid90s
but
dont
think
well
pick
it
up
again
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
wouldnt
have
another
pours
a
dark
mahoganyred
a
creamy
tan
head
laces
the
glass
sides
with
microbubbles
plenty
of
carbonation
coming
up
as
well
smell
is
a
delightful
toasted
malt
with
equal
parts
coffee
toffee
taste
is
refined
sort
of
minerally
and
of
darkish
fruit
a
tinge
of
alcohol
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
but
mostly
this
is
a
sweet
beer
feel
is
active
and
carbonated
drinks
good
i
like
it
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
although
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
because
the
taste
lacks
complexity
drinkability
i
would
only
have
one
and
then
swithch
to
something
a
little
more
robust
there
is
an
astrigent
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
from
notes
at
old
chicago
2002
pours
thinly
to
burnt
caramel
color
bready
honey
and
maple
syrup
aroma
lightly
pungent
with
cloying
sugar
and
high
fructose
corn
syrup
a
bit
of
cinnamon
toward
the
back
flavors
of
wet
old
wood
and
flat
lemon
and
lime
soda
lightly
tart
softly
bitter
and
very
bored
tacky
sticky
and
thin
in
the
mouth
mild
sugary
berries
in
the
dry
finish
altogether
unpleasant
not
recommended
overall
an
interesting
brew
probably
wont
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
but
im
sure
ill
be
in
the
mood
for
it
occasionally
d
not
the
best
but
drinakable
average
that
being
said
i
always
favored
the
companys
beer
crimson
voodoo
going
to
try
to
see
if
thats
still
being
brewed
sweet
to
the
taste
for
a
lager
dark
and
rich
but
not
overly
heavy
moderate
alcohol
content
in
a
german
dunkel
lager
fashion
summary
not
a
go
to
beer
but
a
little
above
average
drinkability
fairly
nice
good
after
taste
its
smoothe
enough
to
just
keep
drinking
while
relaxing
as
i
twisted
off
the
cap
i
had
low
expectations
but
i
am
proud
to
say
that
this
brew
is
all
right
the
taste
is
a
little
week
compared
to
other
dunkels
like
haufbrau
and
the
like
but
for
the
price
of
an
average
american
six
pack
this
one
is
pretty
quaffable
d
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
roasty
beer
not
a
fan
of
the
raisinlike
sweetness
in
beers
and
this
one
has
it
was
able
to
enjoy
thoroughly
enjoy
it
though
its
mild
and
drinkable
enough
but
im
not
getting
a
lot
of
character
from
it
and
it
feels
very
lacking
on
the
mid
where
the
excitement
is
supposed
to
happen
a
surprisingly
heavy
beer
on
the
palate
and
overall
its
not
bad
to
sip
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
all
its
gravity
but
its
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
mulled
over
chewed
and
sampled
in
small
doses
note
the
brewery
may
be
louisiana
in
origin
but
the
label
says
it
actually
was
brewed
in
joseph
huber
brewing
in
wisconsin
due
to
the
aftermath
of
hurricane
katrina
so
cool
in
several
ways
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
with
desent
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
malts
carmel
coffee
with
a
hint
of
citrus
strong
malty
sweetness
on
the
palate
with
coffee
notes
one
of
the
better
tasting
brews
from
the
deep
south
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
good
job
two
thumbs
up
try
it
youll
like
it
i
wasnt
extremely
impressed
with
this
beer
by
all
means
it
was
an
above
average
beer
here
in
lawrenceburg
in
our
local
selection
is
growing
but
it
still
isnt
as
large
and
accessible
as
id
like
it
to
be
i
had
this
one
about
2
nights
ago
while
watching
some
old
episodes
of
dexter
it
was
good
but
i
found
myself
wanting
to
reach
in
the
fridge
and
get
something
like
an
edmund
fitzgerald
or
sierra
nevada
stout
both
which
arent
in
this
line
but
still
all
the
same
this
beer
just
lacked
in
taste
compared
to
what
i
have
been
drinking
kind
of
like
the
lager
version
of
abitas
turbodog
but
with
a
lighter
body
and
even
sweeter
finish
not
a
bad
beer
and
very
food
friendly
but
not
really
up
the
standards
of
todays
craft
beers
seems
a
little
weak
and
simple
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
quite
drinkable
beer
that
doesnt
excite
in
any
way
d
very
drinkable
if
you
dont
get
tired
of
the
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
chocolatebrown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
tea
earthy
hops
and
toffee
the
flavor
is
toffee
chocolate
earthy
hops
and
dirt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
too
terribly
exciting
i
didnt
even
know
we
could
get
this
in
columbus
really
i
dont
care
too
much
i
wont
be
having
this
much
anymore
that
i
dont
have
to
go
to
huntington
so
much
nowadays
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
lot
code
or
expiration
date
the
pour
is
a
good
looking
amberbrown
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
tends
to
be
sweeter
with
an
emphasis
on
the
malts
the
taste
is
also
more
malty
than
anything
else
with
a
notable
sweetness
as
well
as
a
few
raisins
in
the
mix
not
bad
and
it
seems
to
be
true
to
the
style
d
not
unless
i
become
a
fan
of
the
genre
whatever
that
may
be
taste
thinner
than
it
looks
light
on
palate
yet
fuller
taste
profile
resonates
on
the
tongue
without
beating
it
up
has
a
very
thin
porter
taste
to
it
would
never
guess
it
was
a
lager
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
with
it
cool
artwork
but
the
impression
the
beer
leaves
makes
me
think
this
is
more
of
a
gimmick
or
touristy
thing
d
like
whoa
could
have
another
right
now
if
youre
in
new
orleans
try
it
out
d
high
i
enjoyed
this
one
have
a
few
i
was
suggested
this
beer
by
a
friends
brother
and
by
a
manager
at
my
local
grocery
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
so
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
6pack
what
tasted
like
a
lager
with
added
sweet
syrup
looked
exactly
like
coca
cola
even
down
to
the
dissipating
head
taste
of
sugar
and
roasted
sugar
cane
had
a
added
after
brewing
quality
to
it
actually
even
tasted
like
coca
cola
some
fruit
but
mostly
apple
earth
being
drown
out
by
syrup
drinkability
the
butter
and
nut
flavors
seem
to
dominate
the
beer
for
me
and
make
it
fairly
unpleasant
to
drink
very
much
of
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
ive
had
black
lagers
but
this
is
a
black
hole
perhaps
technically
a
lager
in
how
it
was
made
but
more
like
a
light
porter
in
taste
smells
of
chocolate
toffee
tastes
exactly
the
same
meh
maybe
its
unique
but
i
dont
get
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
translucent
dark
cherry
with
a
good
layer
of
foam
the
smell
was
not
very
strong
but
had
a
good
aroma
of
malts
and
toffee
the
taste
was
surprisingly
good
it
had
a
solid
malty
foundation
with
hints
of
caramel
it
was
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
dunkel
spectrum
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
encourage
people
to
try
it
this
is
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
d
very
very
drinkable
a
nice
brew
which
even
though
abv
is
5
still
a
bit
high
for
a
session
for
me
but
could
enjoy
it
many
times
over
would
be
really
great
on
cold
winter
night
sitting
around
the
fire
in
the
fall
another
fine
product
of
dixieland
i
like
this
beer
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
softer
than
it
is
in
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
but
i
do
like
it
given
a
choice
id
pick
negra
modelo
from
mexico
over
it
but
at
least
now
ive
tried
this
one
and
urge
you
to
do
the
same
mediumbodied
with
a
syrupy
thick
sensation
after
the
swallow
an
overall
very
good
dunkeles
pint
glass
pour
and
i
am
met
with
a
flat
cola
brown
ale
with
a
white
foamy
head
which
starts
strong
but
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
a
malt
bomb
explosion
very
malty
with
some
hints
of
roastiness
and
some
faint
citrus
very
surprised
by
the
clean
crisp
malty
taste
i
was
expecting
something
rather
drab
but
this
has
some
pretty
nice
flavor
the
malt
is
there
and
there
is
some
leather
and
black
coffee
characteristics
mild
carbonation
at
5
this
could
be
rather
enjoyable
session
beer
with
some
spicy
foods
or
a
nice
big
pretzel
and
schnitzel
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
not
the
greatest
beer
out
there
but
worthy
of
an
individual
try
md
bubbly
thin
but
quaffable
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
just
wish
it
tasted
better
overall
its
a
fairly
pleasant
beer
with
caramel
cocoa
powder
mocha
hazelnut
marshmallow
notes
and
chocolate
tea
cookie
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
flavors
without
being
too
sweet
i
wake
up
in
the
morning
quite
hungover
stumble
to
the
coffee
machine
damnit
there
is
coffee
from
yesterday
oh
well
pour
the
coffee
toss
some
ice
on
top
and
take
a
sip
i
place
the
glass
down
and
forget
about
it
for
about
an
hour
come
back
it
is
not
sorta
brownish
since
it
is
watered
down
take
a
sip
and
ahhh
it
taste
just
like
dixie
blackend
voodoo
lager
i
expected
bigger
and
blacker
warren
sapp
like
qualities
but
didnt
get
it
steve
urkel
like
qualities
ohh
well
safe
to
say
that
this
will
also
be
the
last
dixie
we
try
if
someone
was
to
rebottle
this
with
an
abita
another
new
orleans
brewery
bottle
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
second
guess
where
it
came
from
weak
try
nothing
special
here
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
small
head
that
is
although
small
long
sustaining
theres
some
nice
lacing
around
the
edge
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
the
appearance
is
unfortunately
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
it
has
a
bit
of
a
smoky
odor
to
it
with
just
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
scent
underneath
not
a
whole
lot
of
taste
here
maybe
a
slight
bit
of
nut
somewhere
in
here
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
which
adds
to
a
pretty
high
drinkabililty
i
could
drink
these
all
day
and
if
this
style
is
your
thing
obviously
its
not
really
mine
this
would
make
a
pretty
great
session
beer
cant
hold
a
candle
to
the
better
versions
of
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
to
say
that
it
is
mediocre
a
decent
casual
lager
perfect
for
watching
the
game
or
whatever
over
all
i
was
initially
disappointed
in
this
beer
this
was
mainly
due
to
my
craving
for
victory
though
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
makes
a
good
session
beer
its
actually
kind
of
refreshing
but
im
always
disappointed
when
the
flavor
doesnt
linger
i
did
drink
it
during
the
super
bowl
and
the
saints
won
so
maybe
theres
something
to
the
voodoo
taste
is
a
bit
odd
got
some
smokiness
and
light
boozy
it
also
has
that
home
brew
wheaty
twang
too
it
not
super
drinkable
because
of
this
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
chocolate
malts
taste
is
good
chocolate
malts
some
notes
of
coffee
very
flavorful
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fine
quality
beer
d
id
get
this
again
its
pretty
unique
in
my
opinion
rjt
d
i
enjoyed
it
but
its
nothing
special
drinkability
this
is
an
excellentdrinking
munich
of
the
few
american
efforts
ive
had
of
the
dunkles
lager
i
think
only
penns
tops
this
one
nicely
done
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
very
easy
to
go
through
better
than
i
had
expected
but
not
special
i
wont
be
seeking
these
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
pretty
drinkable
overall
its
good
beer
but
nothing
special
if
you
happen
upon
it
give
it
a
shot
but
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
search
too
hard
for
it
thanks
to
bigbry
for
a
taste
of
the
south
the
flavor
is
predominantly
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
at
first
it
does
wash
over
the
palate
a
little
quickly
which
makes
you
realize
that
this
is
actually
a
lager
theres
also
a
nice
fizzy
carbonation
to
go
with
the
deep
flavors
the
hops
and
dryness
come
into
play
more
around
the
finish
and
the
beer
rounds
out
a
little
coffeelike
drinks
easily
a
nice
one
to
try
and
i
will
have
to
get
it
on
tap
at
my
local
southern
eateries
doesnt
knock
off
any
socks
but
will
pair
nicely
with
some
okra
you
can
drink
these
all
night
its
not
world
class
by
far
but
its
definitely
good
enough
to
satisfy
dark
amber
body
the
beer
pours
with
a
flask
of
offwhite
foam
that
quickly
fades
to
just
about
nothing
aroma
has
a
caramel
and
molasses
note
actually
very
nice
flavor
is
pretty
mild
and
balanced
at
first
the
carbonation
attacks
the
back
of
the
throat
but
is
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
some
black
patent
flavor
and
astringency
a
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
finish
then
a
lingering
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
ok
feels
somewhat
coarse
due
to
the
aggressive
carbonation
drinkability
also
ok
much
better
than
many
beers
but
not
something
id
pick
on
a
regular
basis
d
really
exceeded
expectations
with
enough
complexity
to
enjoy
this
beer
has
a
great
feel
as
it
goes
down
voodoo
is
very
enjoyable
with
fried
tortillas
and
home
made
salsa
d
very
drinkable
great
balance
of
full
flavor
and
light
body
t
very
smokey
with
a
licorice
taste
to
it
but
it
very
carbonated
rather
than
smooth
as
most
smokey
beers
that
ive
had
have
been
accustomed
to
has
a
nice
little
bite
to
it
poured
a
deep
amberbrown
with
a
modest
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
a
thin
collar
the
aroma
was
lightly
malty
not
much
else
the
taste
was
watery
sweet
and
bitter
but
not
enough
of
either
to
make
a
statement
the
feel
was
just
plain
weak
but
with
adequate
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
i
wouldnt
be
ashamed
to
say
i
liked
this
beer
its
just
way
down
the
list
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
lesser
porters
i
have
had
overall
okay
for
a
munich
dunkel
or
schwarzbier
anyway
if
you
like
beer
thats
sweeter
and
more
malty
give
blackened
voodoo
a
try
it
may
surprise
you
to
deep
ambergarnet
in
color
clear
with
a
creamtan
head
that
quickly
dissipated
aroma
has
notes
of
cherry
plum
and
caramel
malt
oddly
reminds
me
of
a
cherry
slurpy
from
7eleven
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
with
fruit
cherry
plum
followed
by
caramel
malt
with
little
to
no
discernible
hop
character
taste
is
not
unlike
a
bock
beer
also
tastes
a
bit
like
a
blackcherry
soda
body
is
light
to
medium
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
again
somewhat
like
soda
overall
a
very
tasty
offering
but
too
much
like
soda
for
my
taste
probably
a
good
beer
for
noncraft
drinkers
to
begin
with
a
clear
dark
brown
pour
with
a
small
light
tan
head
some
jagged
lacing
left
aroma
is
slightly
metallic
with
some
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
nuttyness
flavor
is
of
roasted
malt
light
caramel
grass
and
grain
very
light
on
the
hops
light
body
with
a
slightly
prickly
mouthfeel
from
the
crabonation
a
fairly
good
offering
that
is
quite
sessionable
pours
a
dark
amber
color
almost
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
colored
head
the
smell
is
of
malts
sweet
bread
and
fruit
notes
maybe
raisin
in
smell
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
malts
breads
and
some
fruit
with
raisins
and
a
little
bit
of
a
floral
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
a
little
bit
slick
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
a
slightly
complex
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
beers
i
got
started
with
when
first
trying
microbrews
in
college
i
remember
the
old
chicago
in
coralville
ia
used
to
have
it
on
the
menu
i
havent
drank
one
in
several
years
and
i
was
under
the
assumption
that
i
wouldnt
think
much
of
it
anymore
however
it
suprised
me
i
think
the
malty
complexity
is
pretty
good
for
a
5
abv
lager
try
it
with
an
open
mind
notes
its
a
nice
overall
dark
lager
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
it
reminded
me
of
a
light
bodied
thinner
oktoberfest
beer
dont
drink
and
review
flavor
is
a
bit
watered
down
but
if
they
are
going
for
a
lager
style
i
dont
mind
so
much
crisp
clean
finish
could
drink
any
time
of
year
and
could
drink
several
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
probably
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
people
cool
bottle
by
the
way
i
would
drink
again
when
i
get
the
chance
finishes
slightly
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
medium
bodied
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
it
pours
an
orange
amber
with
an
inch
or
so
of
head
it
looks
like
most
munich
lagers
ive
seen
the
aroma
is
tough
to
pick
up
since
they
poured
it
into
a
frosty
mug
but
im
getting
a
bit
of
roast
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
tang
of
fruit
it
seems
to
wash
down
the
amazing
crab
cakes
im
eating
so
the
mouthfeel
is
getting
a
decent
grade
from
me
i
could
see
drinking
this
beer
again
although
im
not
going
to
seek
it
out
rich
malt
in
the
aroma
and
it
tastes
toasted
with
grain
in
the
quaff
lots
of
doughy
bread
notes
remind
me
of
an
amber
ale
more
than
any
lager
but
thats
just
me
this
is
one
robust
and
rich
tasting
brew
very
tasty
although
i
dont
know
if
i
could
plow
through
a
sixer
at
a
sitting
blackened
voodoo
is
a
crystal
clear
deep
reddish
brown
lager
with
a
dense
tan
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
clean
fresh
malt
aroma
with
roasty
chocolate
notes
it
is
mediumlight
bodied
and
smooth
pretty
creamy
with
a
dry
finish
its
a
simple
well
balanced
flavor
with
notes
of
burnt
sugar
and
spice
this
is
an
awesome
session
beer
the
beer
poured
with
a
nice
head
which
quickly
flattened
the
color
was
a
dark
reddish
brown
and
nice
lacing
was
left
on
the
glass
i
enjoyed
the
slightly
sweet
caramel
nose
which
matched
its
flavor
along
with
a
slight
roastiness
its
mouthfeel
was
light
and
carbonated
and
overall
for
a
lager
i
found
this
beer
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
my
second
review
with
the
same
score
across
the
board
poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
some
red
tinting
and
almost
no
head
that
left
no
lacing
smelled
very
malty
with
caramel
toffee
and
fruit
notes
and
just
a
hint
of
coffee
tasted
the
same
with
some
roastiness
to
it
smooth
though
just
slightly
oily
could
session
this
pretty
easily
this
is
an
okay
beer
it
tastes
reasonable
and
is
palatable
but
does
not
seem
to
hit
the
spot
overall
it
could
be
more
intense
in
several
realms
but
is
still
worth
the
try
color
is
dark
brown
with
some
slight
cherry
hues
the
twofinger
tan
head
sticks
nicely
to
the
pilsner
glass
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
some
fat
fingers
of
lacing
behind
smells
of
some
roasted
and
caramel
malts
subtle
hops
exist
later
on
the
smell
was
promising
but
the
taste
is
weak
not
much
at
all
going
on
except
perhaps
some
more
toasted
malts
and
an
underlying
sweetness
there
is
a
slight
hop
bite
at
the
very
end
light
bodied
as
expected
and
highly
drinkable
so
much
as
to
leave
you
wanting
more
its
just
missing
some
much
needed
work
in
the
taste
department
drinkability
this
beer
has
some
drinkability
but
not
much
i
dont
expect
ill
be
looking
for
this
beer
in
the
future
this
southern
brew
pours
an
old
brick
red
with
a
fizzy
and
thin
white
head
on
it
aroma
is
very
sweet
some
brown
sugar
and
cookies
mixed
with
some
dark
fruit
taste
is
malty
but
proves
to
be
more
balanced
not
much
sweetness
there
theres
no
real
bitterness
but
the
sweetness
is
certainly
curtailed
by
something
some
light
hints
of
vanilla
before
it
hits
a
roasted
malty
end
proves
very
refreshing
but
this
brew
doesnt
carry
a
lot
of
body
and
is
a
tad
thin
all
in
all
a
solid
brew
but
theres
not
much
outstanding
here
may
be
better
on
tap
d
average
at
best
there
may
be
some
traces
of
fusels
in
this
beer
very
medicinal
d
sweeter
than
i
like
this
just
wasnt
for
me
drinkability
is
average
this
isnt
bad
just
really
average
i
was
suprised
to
find
dixie
beers
in
maryland
i
picked
up
a
sample
of
dixie
beer
and
this
one
poured
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
caramel
brown
color
foamy
head
with
some
lacing
on
the
glass
sweet
malty
smell
and
taste
a
regional
brewer
tries
something
a
little
different
a
solid
effort
this
reminds
me
a
little
of
yuengling
black
and
tan
nice
crisp
begining
and
middle
with
a
smooth
almost
cloying
sweet
aftertaste
getting
some
metallic
and
chewiness
that
really
just
turns
me
away
its
drinkable
enough
but
not
something
i
would
get
again
nice
medium
body
good
viscous
feel
really
and
all
around
nice
nice
beer
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
it
all
of
that
said
its
certainly
sessionable
tastier
than
michelob
tm
definatly
has
some
malt
in
it
but
not
as
roastedness
as
either
the
name
or
smell
would
suggest
has
a
bit
of
a
watery
middle
and
mouthfeel
does
suffer
sum
as
a
result
of
its
lower
than
average
carbonation
has
a
very
nice
citrusacidic
end
except
for
the
watery
middle
this
tastes
and
feels
like
a
very
high
quality
brew
it
does
lack
some
of
the
yeasty
breadyness
of
the
dunkel
catagory
i
think
it
should
be
more
of
a
dark
rich
lager
very
good
no
matter
the
catagory
its
in
a
nice
and
somewhat
uniquetasting
lager
personally
if
i
want
a
black
lager
id
go
for
something
more
like
a
schwarzbier
but
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
this
again
d
even
with
the
mouthfeel
giving
a
little
too
much
this
one
does
go
down
easily
and
is
quite
flavorful
for
its
body
and
strength
this
would
be
a
really
good
beer
to
have
a
couple
of
while
hanging
out
talking
to
friends
not
a
bad
beer
would
drink
another
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
ambercopper
sparkles
some
nice
head
and
some
good
lacing
sweet
scent
very
malty
nice
but
unbalanced
great
taste
good
malt
flavors
going
in
with
a
nice
little
hint
of
caramal
and
a
nice
spike
of
german
hops
at
the
end
to
even
things
out
goes
down
fine
if
a
little
overcarbonated
drinkability
i
am
not
a
seasonal
drinker
but
this
beer
screamed
autumn
to
me
i
sort
of
see
it
like
a
fizzier
slightly
less
strong
version
of
leinenkugels
fireside
nut
brown
a
good
beer
not
great
that
i
could
sessionif
the
time
was
right
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
chocolate
beerlager
worth
a
try
easy
drinking
decent
drinkability
nothing
special
a
good
take
on
a
munich
dunkel
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
the
states
ive
not
had
many
beers
in
this
style
but
im
willing
to
venture
that
they
all
dont
taste
this
strongly
of
coffee
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
me
some
good
coffee
beers
but
seeing
as
this
was
not
advertised
as
such
i
was
sort
of
expecting
a
bit
more
depth
of
flavor
that
said
it
makes
a
decent
session
beer
and
is
quite
enjoyable
once
you
adjust
your
expectations
the
jurys
still
out
on
whether
ill
buy
this
again
pours
a
nice
clear
mahogany
brown
and

much
of

the
foam
dissipates
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
fairly
strong
smoky
with
undertones
of
malt

yeast

is
typically
lagerish
but
has
a
firm
smoky
component
and
hints
of
yeast
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
not
a
downer
not
a
great
beer
but
worth
giving
a
try
drinkability
decent
beer
this
one
needs
some
more
complexity
and
has
a
weird
finish
that
falls
flat
not
bad
pours
a
nice
mahogany
color
with
a
tiny
little
head
to
it
and
minimal
lacing
smell
is
very
europeanlike
almost
a
becks
dark
sort
of
smell
to
it
taste
is
very
nutty
and
bready
again
the
germanness
of
the
beer
really
shines
through
beer
is
a
tad
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
but
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
and
is
easy
enough
to
drink
nothing
great
but
pretty
good
toasty
malts
and
hop
bitterness
really
carry
this
beer
does
not
exactly
fit
into
what
i
normally
think
of
as
a
dunkel
seems
more
like
an
american
amber
to
me
whatever
it
is
its
quite
a
flavorful
and
complex
little
lager
dixies
got
going
on
some
mild
hints
of
light
berries
maybe
raspberries
and
strawberries
along
with
a
bit
of

bbcsd0902geoff
had
a
bottle
this
past
sunday
with
lunch
at
sunset
cantina
on
comm
ave
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
medium
brown
color
decent
sized
head
at
first
then
gone
quickly
good
amount
of
carbonation
noticeable
smelled
a
bit
like
dried
fruits
such
as
grapes
and
figs
taste
was
interesting
for
a
lager
from
louisiana
a
little
bit
fruity
but
very
malty
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
a
tad
watery
lowers
my
score
for
mouthfeel
but
doesnt
affect
drinkability
too
much
as
this
was
a
smooth
drinking
beer
i
could
see
this
as
a
nice
changeofpace
beer
in
the
oppressive
heat
of
the
deep
south
light
smooth
but
with
some
flavor
d
a
decent
session
beer
but
the
flavors
dont
make
for
a
6
or
more
pound
back
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
although
this
brew
is
the
first
dixie
beer
that
ive
tried
i
dont
think
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
brewery
it
is
an
appealing
label
and
has
a
unique
name
but
there
is
really
no
body
to
this
brew
all
in
all
neither
horrible
nor
pleasurable
the
carbonation
issue
detracts
from
something
that
would
otherwise
be
fairly
average
with
few
bright
points
not
far
from
the
style
but
not
exactly
a
shining
example
wouldnt
really
want
to
drink
this
one
again
just
a
bit
lackluster
and
unforgettable
i
guess
you
can
drink
alot
of
these
but
i
would
just
buy
a
single
to
try
it
great
marketing
and
packaging
bee
a
good
1015
years
since
i
had
this
and
its
bastard
cousin
reddened
voodoo
was
a
unique
brew
back
then
not
so
much
now
at
this
pace
the
next
time
i
have
this
ill
be
in
my
60s
md
overall
not
a
very
good
tasting
beer
in
my
opinion
the
overwhelming
cooked
vegetable
smell
and
taste
just
kind
of
ruined
it
for
me
drinkability
much
better
than
their
flagship
dixie
beer
easy
drinking
reddish
brown

thin

is

caramel

faintly
herbal
sort
of
playing
it
safe
in
the

deparment
mild
carbonation
lighter
feel
dry
and
lightly
sweet
finish
easy
enough
to
have
one
to
pair
with
cajun
cuisine
but
i
didnt
really
feel
the
need
for
another
an
okay
mdl
but
not
up
to
par
with
what
they
make
in
germany
worth
a
try
but
not
the
model
the
taste
is
a
definite
let
down
the
beer
is
much
less
sweet
more
drying
more
metallic
and
more
musty
than
i
ever
remembered
it
i
recalled
a
rather
pronounced
molasses
and
roasted
notes
to
this
beer
now
the
beer
is
just
musty
dry
metallic
arid
caramel
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
back
to
one
trip
down
memory
lane
is
enough
unless
of
course
the
old
recipe
comes
back
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
like
a
parched
desert
the
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
that
amazing
smell
its
malty
and
little
dry
average
the
chocolatecaramel
flavors
do
appear
as
the
beer
warms
but
they
vanish
quickly
almost
like
magic
larger
drinks
can
reveal
some
added
complexity
pass
d
its
drinkable
but
you
could
find
dozens
if
not
hundreds
of
better
beers
out
there
always
tastes
better
in
new
orleans
for
some
reason
this
pours
a
very
dark
cherry
red
with
a
nice
light
brown
cap
that
leaves
some
thinspotty
lace
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
extremely
subtle
floral
notesnot
a
big
nose
here
the
flavors
are
medium
roasted
malts
that
taste
like
nearly
burnt
oat
bread
caramel
and
hints
of
candy
and
licorice
are
nice
and
unassumingyet
give
this
a
nice
flavor
and
complexity
a
dry
cocoa
powder
finish
rounds
off
a
decent
attempt
at
a
dark
lager
the
carbonation
mellows
rapidly
and
helps
drinkability
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
is
better
than
dixie
lager
good
to
see
they
can
brew
outside
of
the
transparent
yellow
box
good
stuff
pours
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
and
a
short
offwhite
head
subtle
malty
aroma
kind
of
roasty
sweet
hoppy
lager
with
plenty
of
malt
nice
finish
always
had
this
with
bbq
chicken
while
in
virginia
havent
tried
it
since
moving
may
have
been
the
atmosphere
but
i
remember
this
as
being
a
nice
easy
beer
d
this
is
an
underdone
beer
it
didnt
strike
me
as
being
very
inspired
notes
overall
not
too
complex
and
a
little
thin
however
what
is
present
works
pretty
well
together
a
nice
change
from
my
usual
style
of
choice
for
a
session
apa
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
and
a
nice
alternative
not
bad
of
a
beer
i
tried
this
one
it
has
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
flavor
to
it
i
am
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
i
have
never
had
any
beer
from
dixie
brewing
co
i
think
i
may
actually
try
more
beer
from
this
company
this
beer
would
go
good
with
a
nice
thanksgiving
dinner
or
maybe
a
hearty
soup
this
beer
poured
a
dark
reddishtinted
amber
with
a
singlefinger
tan
head
the
nose
is
pretty
tight
all
im
getting
is
malt
and
maybe
a
little
nuttiness
the
taste
is
almost
all
malt
as
well
theres
a
little
bit
of
smokey
and
nuttiness
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
slightly
thick
with
some
fine
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
exactly
going
to
blow
anyones
socks
off
but
not
a
horrible
brew
to
try
if
youre
interested
in
the
style
d
very
drinkable
beer
the
best
dixie
d
this
is
a
pretty
malty
beer
but
very
smooth
and
clean
its
not
terribly
complex
but
definitely
a
nice
kickback
beer
i
can
see
this
pairing
well
with
certain
foods
d
no
not
for
me
will
i
drink
the
rest
of
my
6
pack
of
course
but
i
will
never
purchase
this
again
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
head
that
lasts
seconds
aroma
is
malty
and
some
caramel
taste
is
not
what
i
remember
this
beer
to
be
taste
like
a
watered
down
malt
bomb
its
crisp
and
is
drinkable
i
remember
this
beer
having
bite
was
a
tad
darker
and
actually
looked
like
the
name
stated
back
in
the
midlate90s
19961999
not
sure
what
happened
but
i
heard
an
outside
brewery
was
brewing
this
stuff
under
the
dixie
name
this
beer
and
along
with
the
crimson
was
my
choice
at
oddfellows
in
hoboken
i
miss
this
beer
just
disappointed
still
drinkable
taste
taste
is
alot
like
the
smell
very
light
and
refreshing
but
its
still
something
that
makes
you
want
to
slow
down
and
savor
it
pours
a
nice
semiclear
mahogany
color
smallish
offwhite
head
fades
rapidly
into
a
collar
around
the
glass
some
lacing
hanging
on
and
lots
and
lots
of
bubbles
rising
up
to
the
surface
im
getting
a
good
amount
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
roastynutty
qualities
pretty
sweet
overall
some
faint
dark
fruits
cocoa
but
also
a
slightly
green
hop
presence
on
the
thin
side
of
mediumbodied
some
nice
lingering
flavorsbitterness
pretty
quenching
brew
yeah
you
could
drink
a
few
rich
and
sweet
but
refreshing
and
drinkable
at
the
same
time
falls
nicely
into
the
münchner
dunkel
style
but
in
a
blind
tasting
i
would
probably
have
called
it
a
superb
altbier
offering
without
having
known
that
it
was
a
lager
overall
a
great
offering
from
a
true
katrina
survivor
i
love
the
look
of
this
bottle
pours
a
mahogany
light
brown
with
some
red
hues
and
a
minimal
layer
of
white
foam
head
with
minimal
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
sugar
and
spice
and
everything
nice
tastes
sweet
up
front
with
roasted
malts
the
dominant
flavor
sugars
and
spices
meld
nicely
with
the
other
flavors
in
this
one
there
is
a
party
in
my
mouth
and
everyone
is
invited
nice
medium
carbonation
with
lingering
sweetness
great
with
spicy
food
but
that
makes
sense
since
it
is
from
new
orleans
i
remember
this
having
a
stronger
chocolate
taste
from
many
years
ago
when
i
had
this
last
but
this
is
nice
and
will
buy
it
again
poured
from
a

into

about
1
of
fluffy

did
not
stay
around

long

with
some
spices
tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
with
some
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
not
much
carbonation
easy
to
drink
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
candied
apple
and
molasses
and
the
flavor
holds
that
along
with
a
mellow
roasted
caramel
note
the
taste
also
finishes
with
a
mild
herbal
hop
note
for
balance
this
beer
is
pretty
lowkey
but
itd
be
good
bbq
beer
i
like
it
enough
to
think
about
it

a
novelty
label
which
helps
the
cause
a

didnt
last

long
aroma
is

the
flavor
is
roasted

is
a
bit
sweet
this

smooth

drink
nothing
spectacular

a
decent
session
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
brown
color
with
a
dense
khaki
colored
head
that
left
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
doughy
malt
some
toasted
malt
with
hints
of
butter
the
taste
is
of
a
lightly
toasted
malt
some
honey
and
caramel
some
grainy
notes
are
found
towards
the
end
the
feel
is
light
with
pronounced
but
not
overly
strong
carbonation
finishes
fairly
crisp
and
slightly
tart
a
decent
tasting
lager
with
some
nice
toasted
qualities
doesnt
really
remind
me
of
a
munich
dunkel
though
its
an
ok
beer
to
have
lying
around
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
two

light
khaki
colored
head
that
remains

fair
amount
of
stick
left
on
the
sides
of

nutty
smokey
and
malty
some
sugary
sweetness
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
and
grains
very
watered
down
flavor
from
start
to
finish
the
smell
really
lead
me
to
believe
it
would
be
more
some
roasted
malts
grains
and
caramel
malt
but
not
much
else
aftertaste
is
semisweet
and
pretty
clean
with
an
interesting
pepper
like
taste
light
body
with
a
soft
creamy
feel
to
it
and
a
strong
carbonation
not
a
terrible
beer
just
not
one
i
would
go
out
and
buy
again
down
the
road
glad
to
hear
the
brewery
is
overcoming
the
katrina
disaster
not
bad
pours
a
four

light
tan
head
that
fades

some

nice
clear
mahogany
color
light
carbonation

medium
bodied
balanced

flavor
is
slightly
sweet

nothing
special
some
what
watery
bitter
finish
and
not
a
five
like
i
rated
it
back
in
my
youth
early
90s
very
disappointing
maybe
its
because
its
contract
brewed
now
and
not
the
original
we
can
only
hope
that
dixie
brewing
will
rise
from
katrinas
destruction

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
the
folks
at
dixie
have
an
interesting
take
on
the
lager
style
this
is
considerably
darker
and
more
flavorful
than
a
standard
lager
but
it
finishes
just
as
smooth
and
crisply
im
quite
happy
with
this
brew
and
would
definately
try
other
ones
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
d
this
was
interesting
not
like
a
traditional
dunkel
lager
but
still
drinkable
d
a
little
flat
but
plsent
with
an
anticipation
of
your
next
sip
d
this
isnt
too
filling
and
it
is
pretty
tasty
ill
probably
drink
the
rest
that
were
in
the
fridge
hey
you
cant
leave
beer
like
that
d
i
used
to
love
this
beer
when
i
was
younger
definately
a
gateway
beer
in
my
case
simple
good
beer
i
wish
dixie
continued
luck
in
rebuilding

waterylooking
but

tiny
head
of
tanlight
brown
foam
that
disappears
quickly
a
very
thin
film
of
tan
remains
on
top
of
the
beer
it
smells
very
elegant
chocolates
and
caramels
abound
with
a
touch
of
lemon
in
the
nose
the
beer
is
really
quite
watery
not
much
in
the
mouthfeel
department
very
malty
and
bitter
in
taste
with
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
emerging
midswallow
the
lingering
taste
is
that
of
dark
chocolate
and
bread
a
decent
beer
but
if
you
want
a
good
schwarzbier
i
recommend
sprechers
black
bavarian
over
this
one
found
this
one
at
the
local
publix
had
never
seen
it
before
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
served
it
chilled
in
my
unibroue
maudite
bubbler
poured
virtually
no
head
even
after
a
had
pour

in
the
light
a
nice
ruby
color
smelled
faintly
of
candied
sugar
and
malt
with
a
hint
of
brewed
coffee
taste
wasnt
over
powering
a
slight
smokiness
malt
very
sweet
with
a
little
coffee
in
the
finish
carbonation
was
fierce
and
stung
my
tongue
with
every
sip
i
prefer
a
little
smoother
quaff
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
better
for
desert
though
i
believe
i
got
this
bottle
at
3
cellars
in
franklin
wi
this
is
defitely
a
more
malt
heavy
lager
but
i
still
found
it
to
be
quite
tasty
drinkable
and
an
overall
decent

experience

a
flat
soft
drink
this
is
a
drinkable
lager
and
as
a
side
note
it
goes
very
well
with
barbeque
pork
toss
on
some
dr
john
on
the
turntable
and
visualize
a
night
on
bourbon
st
the
beer
is
brilliantly
clear
mohagoney
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
highly
malty
very
nutty
and
slightly
roasty
the
flavor
is
very
malty
mainly
roasty
nutty
and
bittersweet
in
the
background
the
finish
is
crisp
with
a
nice
lingering
maltiness
body
is
mediumthin
and
carbonation
moderate
overall
a
tasty
easy
to
drink
malty
beer
d
this
beer
surprised
me
i
was
thinking
that
i
would
try
a
beer
that
was
not
world
class
or
anything
like
that
but
i
was
treated
by
this
delicious
dark
lager
that
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
could
easily
have
a
sixpack
of
these
any
day
definitely
something
to
try
out
d
i
really
dig
this
beer
had
it
a
while
back
when
i
was
in
new
orleans
and
picked
it
up
to
bring
back
some
old
memories
absolutely
drinkable
blackened
voodoo
lager
is
better
than
your
average
lager
just
dont
expect
anything
too
great
or
you
may
be
dissapointed
cool
name
and
bottle
though
definitely
a
sessionable
bayou
beer
d
i
think
this
brew
is
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
id
like
more
body
but
this
might
make
a
good
introduction
for
novices
into
darker
brews
watery
feel
like
a
lager
but
not
in
a
bad
way
leaves
a
good
film
on
the
tongue
its
a
nice
caramelladen
drink
light
in
body
and
drinkable
sweet
and
good
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
copper
colored
brown
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
roasted
coffee
caramel
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
caramel
malt
with
a
faint
hoppiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
on
the
watery
side
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
subpar
brew
that
really
doesnt
possess
anything
that
makes
me
what
to
purchase
again
drinkability
is
nice
id
have
a
second
if
there
was
one
here
balanced
carbonation
level
with
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
definately
a
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
see
myself
purchasing
and
drinking
this
again
not
as
heavy
or
deep
as
i
expected
i
would
drink
this
one
again
this
beer
was
given
to
me
by
a
friend
it
poured
an
amberreddish
color
the
head
didnt
last
very
long
and
kept
a
thing
layer
on
the
top
there
was
slight
carbonation
to
the
beer
i
expected
a
heavier
body
to
it
overall
not
a
beer
that
i
would
necessarily
seek
out
but
it
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
dixie
blackened
voodoo
lager
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
smells
like
caramel
malt
caramel
malt
dominates
but
there
is
a
noble
hop
twang
backing
it
up
i
like
it
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
a
very
drinkable
lager
i
could
see
myself
drinking
five
or
six
in
the
course
of
an
afternoon
or
evening
this
beer
has
a
really
odd
mouthfeel
some
good
flavors
start
in
quickly
but
then
fizzes
out
too
soon
would
be
better
if
the
flavors
stayed
around
for
just
a
little
while
longer
verdict
mildly
drinkable
and
inoffensive
i
cant
understand
the
negative
reviews
definitely
more
drinkable
than
dixie
jazz
gotta
be
average
at
least
good
carbonation
medium
bodied
no
lace
i
like
the
feel
good
session
beer
goes
down
smooth
i
will
try
this
again
when
it
is
being
brewed
in
new
orleans
again

good
drinkable

i
am
glad
i
got
a
sixpack
so
i
can
try
i
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
malt
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
nothing
like
the
aroma
in
fact
it
is
more
like
nothing
than
anything
there
are
faint
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
but
they
disappear
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
annoyingly
high
carbonation
overall
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
if
the
taste
were
more
like
the
aroma
and
the
body
were
a
little
fuller
as
it
is
this
is
a
beer
i
will
not
be
drinking
again
drinkability
a
pleasant
enough
sessionable
beer
with
just
enough
flavor
to
hold
your
attention
but
not
nearly
enough
to
make
you
think
gee
i
sure
could
go
for
a
dixie
blackened
voodoo
right
about
now
this
one
is
definitely
a
session
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
in
dixie
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
but
if
i
was
a
guest
at
someones
house
and
the
offered
me
one
i
would
not
decline
md
carbonation
is
about
right
a
little
slick
on
the
tongue
body
is
light
to
medium
drinkability
is
fine
as
well
as
someone
who
doesnt
drink
many
lagers
this
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
with
the
hop
character
the
hoppiness
actually
reminds
me
of
a
local
pale
ales
hop
profile
this
brew
also
deserves
bonus
points
due
the
determination
of
the
brewery
to
rebuild
and
rebrew
after
hurricane
katrina
thinner
texture
with
a
lowmoderate
carbonation
especially
for
a
lager
dull
and
somewhat
creamy
with
a
slightly
metallic
and
semidry
finish
not
impressive
with
little
character
and
somewhat
bland
throughout
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
as
its
flavorful
wont
knock
you
over
and
has
some
substance
to
it
pours
beautifully
but
dudethis
smells
like
dirty
socks
flavor
is
decently
roasted
but
it
just
seems
a
bit
odd
to
me
it
tastes
dirty
as
well
in
a
way
as
it
warms
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
even
though
still
though
a
bit
too
live
and
leafy
feel
is
nice
just
overall
it
seems
to
lack
balance
decent
but
not
a
mind
blower
might
be
interesting
on
cask
this
alright
i
remember
it
darker
back
in
the
day
but
i
could
be
mistaken
some
more
malt
guts
this
wouldnt
be
bad
otherwise
id
only
recommend
in
a
pinch
better
yet
find
sam
adams
black
lager
or
hell
even
shiners
bohemian
black
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
chalice
poured
a
hazy
clear
dark
amber
with
a
large
2
inch
head
that
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
down
the
chalice
the
aroma
was
of
ashtrays
that
musty
old
ash
smell
it
also
had
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
a
very
gently
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
very
average
i
dont
think
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
but
1
isnt
bad
this
is
a
unique
and
tasty
dunkel
lager
d
a
tasty
american
dark
lager
that
is
very
drinkable
w
a
standard
5abv
that
makes
it
quaffable
and
just
as
appealing
as
the
first
time
i
tasted
it
about
11
years
ago
a
basic
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
enjoy
blackened
voodoo
for
its
simplicity
wow
this
is
one
foamy
beer
amber
colored
beer
with
aroma
of
faint
toffee
taste
is
average
with
vanilla
and
faint
caramel
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
try
again
unless
it
was
given
to
me
i
guess
i
would
recommend
to
try
it
at
least
once
just
to
note
abv
is
listed
on
bottle
as
5
fyiaccording
to
the
label
this
brewery
was
almost
wiped
out
by
katrina
but
with
a
lot
of
friends
they
are
coming
back
to
life
as
quick
as
possible
its
nice
to
help
support
a
true
success
story
and
get
a
nice
reward
with
the
taste
overall
impression
this
one
used
to
be
available
in
the
co
market
disappeared
for
a
while
and
seems
to
have
made
a
comeback
the
label
mentions
that
the
brewery
was
almost
destroyed
by
katrina
so
i
assume
that
is
why
it
was
missing
for
a
while
beer
is
decidely
average
not
horrible
but
certainly
nothing
to
draw
me
back
dnot
very
complex
but
decent
enough
a
good
choice
in
la
drinkability
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
from
dixie
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
hard
to
find
now
and
since
dixie
doesnt
brew
it
anymore
that
blows
md
fizzy
and
light
showing
not
much
of
a
body
rather
than
sugarpacked
thickness
the
flavour
profile
shows
the
features
of
a
schwartzbier
more
than
of
a
munich
dunkel
to
me
as
the
breadymalty
theme
is
absent
overall
a
lacklustre
beer
in
need
of
a
balance
and
more
hops
while
whats
too
much
here
is
the
sugary
flat
sweetness
maybe
this
clone
is
not
brewed
quite
faithfully
after
all
nothing
special
in
the
feel
of
this
beer
but
it
does
drink
well
tasty
worth
the
1
25
i
spent
overall
a
pretty
average
brew
the
best
dixie
beer
ive
tried
probably
worth
a
try
12oz
bottle
dark
brown
almost
opaque
from
what
i
can
see
around
the
edges
i
think
it
is
clear
ruby
highlights
present
as
well
very
small
light
tan
head
aroma
was
surprising
port
wine
mild
vinous
and
sweet
taste
was
quite
different
roasted
malt
leading
to
a
coffee
flavor
maybe
some
burnt
toast
hop
bittering
was
light
and
showed
up
mainly
in
the
finish
all
told
the
beer
was
mainly
bitter
with
only
a
little
sweetness
which
was
not
what
the
aroma
led
me
to
expect
at
all
mouthfeel
was
a
light
body
with
very
low
carbonation
could
have
used
more
overall
the
beer
was
ok
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
complex
given
the
issues
down
in
new
orleans
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
sometime
down
the
road
head
quickly
emancipated
deep
colour
can
hardly
see
my
finger
through
the
other
side
odd
aroma
which
is
distinct
some
malt
but
in
accompaniment
to
a
weird
liquor
taste
sweet
and
candy
like
clearly
a
lager
with
extract
that
keep
you
guessing
no
finish
bodytexture
is
fine
taste
has
syrupy
makeup
full
of
extract
in
the
aftertaste
not
very
flavorful
i
could
drink
again
though
thanks
crwills
thanks
crwills
it
was
past
due
the
brewery
is
shut
down
owing
to
recovery
some
oily
additive
to
a
weak
lager
walnut
extract
thought
it
was
a
shwartzbier
some
roast
cheap
booze
aroma
carmel
lighter
mouthfeel
but
quaffable
wont
be
sampling
the
rest
of
the
brewery
line
drinkability
is
ok
not
that
exciting
so
one
may
be
enough
for
me
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
really
didnt
have
high
hopes
picked
this
up
as
a
1
50
single
about
a
year
ago
and
never
got
around
to
trying
it
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
beers
style
but
i
will
say
that
after
tasting
this
one
i
am
looking
forward
to
experimenting
with
other
examples
overall
this
beer
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
if
apperance
and
smell
that
it
produces
try
it
if
you
see
it
but
dont
get
to
excited
would
co
decent
with
a
thick
stew
but
there
are
better
alternatives
poured
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
sparse
tannish
head
monimum
lacing
as
the
head
rapidly
fell
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
an
extremely
nice
combination
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
taste
matches
the
smell
with
the
roasted
malt
and
caramel
and
adds
some
dark
fruitiness
plums
to
the
mixture
mothfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
acceptable
very
drinkable
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
and
is
actively
carbonated
im
not
generally
a
big
lager
fan
but
this
one
is
decent
theres
no
head
it
actually
looks
more
like
a
cola
sitting
in
the
glass
i
wouldve
thought
maybe
theyd
given
me
a
coke
or
pepsi
if
i
hadnt
poured
it
out
of
the
bottle
myself
like
i
said
i
generally
dont
like
lagers
but
if
you
take
just
minute
sips
of
this
one
it
vaguely
reminds
you
of
a
weak
carbonated
stout
the
only
reason
i
got
it
was
cuz
we
were
eating
at
this
great
cajun
restaurant
called
the
palace
just
off
state
street
in
santa
barbara
which
i
highly
recommend
pours
very
dark
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
head
disappears
fast
and
never
comes
back
aroma
is
decent
with
a
roasted
malt
overtone
and
mild
hops
slightly
roasted
flavor
as
well
but
way
too
thinbodied
even
for
a
lager
this
tasted
slightly
watered
down
not
painful
to
drink
but
not
enjoyable
either
seemed
like
something
was
missing
from
this
brew
a
six
pack
of
dixie
is
one
of
the
pricier
ones
out
on
the
west
coast
should
this
really
be
a
trend
im
aftaid
i
will
have
to
begin
passing
on
this
wonderful
beer
overall
impression
a
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
good
cross
over
for
folks
weaning
off
bmc
lets
try
to
support
gulf
coast
breweries
for
a
while
we
dont
want
to
lose
any
recommended
lower
grade
for
drinkability
as
im
not
sure
how
much
of
this
i
could
actually
take
at
once
time
however
much
more
interesting
than
i
had
expected
and
definitely
worth
grabbing
if
you
happen
to
come
upon
it
after
admiring
the
appearance
and
enjoying
the
nose
i
had
reasonably
high
hopes
that
dixie
blackened
voodoo
would
be
my
favorite
of
the
three
dixie
beers
that
ive
tried
so
far
ill
have
to
give
the
nod
to
dixie
lager
though
i
love
the
name
and
the
spooky
bayou
label
the
least
the
brewery
can
do
is
to
give
us
a
beer
that
is
equal
to
its
theme
from
the
bottle
got
this
in
a
trade
but
cannot
remember
who
but
thanks
to
the
one
that
sent
this
to
me
poured
black
with
a
tan
head
aroma
caramel
brown
sugar
raisinsroot
beer
sweet
toast
flavor
metallic
caramel
cola
toast
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
still
it
will
be
sad
to
see
the
variety
of
american
craft
beer
diminished
if
dixie
is
gone
forever
i
decided
to
try
this
beer
for
the
same
reason
as
sopor
did
i
may
never
be
able
to
have
it
again
i
hate
when
the
little
guys
go
under
or
get
devistated
by
an
act
of
god
nonetheless
on
to
the
beer
poured
out
to
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
respectable
quarter
inch
head
of
cream
colored
foam
medium
low
carbonation
smell
was
somewhat
caramel
like
with
some
faint
malt
overtones
taste
is
straightforward
and
rather
one
dementional
flavors
of
slighty
smoked
malt
and
some
dark
chocolate
towards
the
finish
nothing
amazing
mediocre
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
watery
and
weak
side
this
brew
is
miles
beyond
most
macros
and
has
a
place
in
the
beer
world
even
though
it
isnt
the
best
beer
in
the
world
lets
hope
that
dixie
along
with
those
hit
by
katrina
recover
from
the
devistation
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
i
picked
this
sixer
up
purely
becauase
i
dont
know
if
i
will
be
able
to
buy
this
beer
ever
again
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
did
give
the
last
five
bottles
and
the
case
away
to
a
friend
who
collects
sixpacks
they
werent
worth
drinking
by
my
standards
and
im
pretty
sure
four
of
these
bottles
will
make
it
into
his
collection
with
the
top
on
im
glad
to
have
this
bottle
in
my
collection
but
i
wont
drink
this
beer
again
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
this
may
be
my
last
chance
to
review
a
beer
from
dixie
since
they
were
having
financial
troubles
even
before
katrina
sweet
malty
aroma
with
just
a
little
faint
coffee
notes
in
the
background
tastes
just
like
it
smells
sweet
malty
with
nice
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
good
beer
i
hope
dixie
can
make
a
come
back
pours
a
dark
black
with
ruby
highlights
and
an
offwhite
head
nose
is
big
and
malty
up
front
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
taste
was
surprisingly
complex
for
a
lager
grainy
malts
bitter
coffee
grounds
sweet
chocolate
and
dark
fruity
notes
all
the
flavors
are
subtle
but
theres
a
nice
balance
of
toastybready
notes
and
bittersweet
coffeechocolate
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
velvety
smooth
with
a
rich
body
for
a
lager
supremely
drinkable
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
an
american
porter
and
a
schwarzbier
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
sad
to
think
that
its
probably
the
last
time
ill
ever
have
it
light
and
easy
drinking
drinkable
like
well
bmc
brew
very
dark
color
dark
tiny
head
way
under
carbonated
thin
body
you
can
taste
the
caramel
malts
maybe
some
chocolate
or
coffee
very
light
on
the
citrus
hops
but
you
know
theyre
there
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
i
can
see
how
you
could
pick
up
a
six
pack
if
the
price
was
right
sampled
bottle
while
bottling
my
ipa
homebrew
poured
a
midnight
black
color
with
a
healthy
brown
fluffy
head
some
lacing
of
the
head
sweet
malty
smell
first
taste
has
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
taste
then
finishes
with
malt
flavor
overall
a
good
beer
basically
an
ordinary
american
micro
solution
to
an
ordinary
german
beer
i
usually
like
the
finess
and
quality
of
german
lagers
but
the
munich
dunkels
usually
dont
contain
the
maltiness
and
robustness
to
significantly
stand
out
blackened
voodoo
is
even
less
so
weak
thin
appearance
with
a
dainty
white
head
that
falls
quickly
overcarbonated
and
everso
sligh
malty
sweet
scent
no
hops
in
the
nose
and
less
toasty
or
caramel
aromas
than
desired
taste
is
too
subtle
to
be
appreciated
thin
and
watery
to
the
palate
hopped
only
to
offset
sweetness
minor
sweetness
remains
for
only
seconds
into
the
aftertaste
in
my
opinion
a
subpar
beer
for
the
flavors
and
consistency
that
i
like
in
a
german
dunkel
but
an
easy
drinking
beer
amongst
the
crowds
of
bmc
drinkers
last
night
in
uptown
charlotte
a
haven
of
hope
was
found
at
the
fox
and
the
hound
with
their
40
bottle
selection
i
went
with
the
blackened
voodoo
as
a
final
brew
for
the
evening
thinking
this
would
take
me
a
while
to
finish
and
feel
full
almost
too
easy
to
drink
maybe
because
i
thought
this
was
a
porter
or
possibly
a
stout
while
pouring
nice
head
and
lacing
hints
of
caramel
and
nuts
better
name
and
label
than
drink
itself
though
taste
begins
with
a
faint
toffee
note
paired
with
a
subtle
hop
background
and
finishes
with
dry
leather
there
really
isnt
much
to
this
beer
finishes
a
bit
thin
and
watery
for
my
tastes
quite
a
drinkable
beer
but
definitely
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
not
particularly
memorable
a
brew
i
would
probably
only
want
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
theyre
kind
of
hard
to
work
through
because
of
the
dominating
sweetness
appears
deep
deep
black
with
ruby
highlights
very
impressive
head
for
this
beer
aroma
is
that
of
caramel
taste
is
rich
for
a
lager
some
chocolate
notes
there
as
well
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
perhaps
its
due
to
the
fact
that
i
first
found
it
off
of
bourbon
street
after
a
few
days
of
drinking
american
adjunct
lager
and
it
was
a
welcome
break
very
nonoffensive
very
clean
and
good
im
glad
its
finally
distributed
into
michigan
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
pleasant
very
drinkable
not
an
incredible
beer
but
not
bad
id
call
it
a
schwartzbier
only
a
touch
lighter
well
this
little
number
turned
out
to
be
a
waste
of
money
tastes
like
a
fruitcake
only
less
complicated
the
image
of
some
bizarre
haunted
lagoon
on
the
lable
makes
me
think
that
it
was
designed
by
some
goth
kid
or
a
uriah
heep
fan
who
had
too
many
bad
trips
it
poured
blackblack
like
my
soulwith
waning
redness
there
was
no
head
retention
to
speak
of
the
smell
was
rather
sweet
though
swiss
cheese
slightly
smokey
and
light
cinnamon
were
evident
the
subsequent
cheese
taste
was
almost
overpowering
this
took
some
getting
used
to
for
me
but
i
began
to
enjoy
it
about
a
third
of
the
way
through
this
is
a
very
solid
choice
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
but
not
risky
the
taste
was
of
roasted
dark
malt
but
it
was
not
overpowering
it
seemed
a
bit
thin
still
drinkable
though
and
id
go
for
another
if
it
were
available
medium
body
with
mild
yet
powerful
carbonation
smooth
and
clean
easy
to
drink
refreshing
nice
dark
lager
pours
a
nice
redish
brown
color
but
with
little
head
maybe
14
a
finger
smell
is
not
pleasant
oversweet
with
some
aroma
i
couldnt
place
at
first
offputting
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
but
now
i
know
what
the
aroma
is
caramelization
lots
and
lots
way
too
much
in
fact
this
beer
isnt
malty
its
caramelly
despite
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
about
right
and
the
beer
isnt
completely
undrinkable
i
didnt
have
a
2nd
though
at
one
time
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
do
now
too
damn
sweet
and
that
tartness
is
very
offputting
definitely
wont
have
two
light
to
medium
bodied
this
beer
has
a
strong
coffee
like
appearance
with
some
burgundy
hues
and
the
same
could
be
said
for
the
taste
a
bitter
hoppy
burn
contributes
well
to
the
rich
smokey
flavor
hints
of
caramel
chocolate
and
espresso
collide
in
my
mouth
the
flavor
is
stoutlike
while
the
mouthful
is
distinctly
lager
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
very
smokey
but
particularly
faint
compared
to
what
youd
expect
from
a
beer
this
dark
i
probably
couldnt
drink
this
stuff
every
day
but
the
uniqueness
of
this
brew
is
definitely
worth
a
try
or
two
edit
about
the
abv
its
not
posted
so
its
hard
to
assume
from
smell
and
taste
i
would
guess
its
above
the
5
mark
making
it
above
average
in
that
department
and
thats
a
conservative
estimate
to
add
to
that
assumption
ive
had
two
and
im
a
touch
light
headed
very
abnormal
for
me
for
only
having
two
while
im
not
normally
a
lager
drinker
to
me
this
is
a
very
good
beer
probably
because
it
is
so
different
from
most
lagers
the
hops
was
nicely
restrained
while
still
present
making
for
a
wellbalanced
and
easily
quaffable
brew
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
and
am
looking
forward
to
having
it
on
tap
this
is
some
pretty
good
stuff
appearance
is
almost
pitch
black
head
is
medium
height
and
tan
nose
is
very
malty
with
a
smell
that
reminds
me
of
molasses
taste
is
all
malt
with
a
strong
molasses
taste
taste
was
slightly
cloying
the
first
time
i
tried
blackened
voodoo
but
tonight
it
seems
fine
maltheads
should
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
brew
but
not
something
i
would
go
crazy
over
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
hint
of
ruby
red
and
a
nice
onefinger
tan
head
nice
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
and
molasses
sweet
malt
dominates
the
pleasant
palate
which
is
accented
by
toffee
and
a
little
bit
of
oak
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
precedes
a
dry
finish
today
was
maybe
a
little
too
hot
to
properly
enjoy
a
darker
beer
but
i
liked
it
just
fine
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
very
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
pale
malts
slightly
creamy
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
creamy
rich
malty
flavor
but
with
a
dry
metallic
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
dunkel
it
has
good
aroma
and
mouthfeel
the
metallic
finish
turns
me
off
kind
of
boring
pours
out
as
black
as
coal
just
the
way
i
like
it
developed
a
small
head
but
had
excellent
retention
settles
to
a
thin
collar
with
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
could
only
be
described
as
odd
and
somewhat
unpleasant
at
that
my
brotherinlaw
described
it
as
an
old
foot
and
i
find
it
hard
to
argue
with
that
assessment
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
bittering
hops
some
nutty
flavors
also
seem
to
linger
underneath
the
complexity
of
it
all
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
considering
how
dark
and
malty
this
offering
is
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
if
you
dont
smell
it
too
much
however
an
easy
drinking
lager
but
i
was
expecting
more
body
and
taste
from
a
dark
lager
dark
brown
beer
even
dark
brown
than
a
porter
i
just
had
i
dont
think
i
should
have
read
an
earlier
review
there
is
definitely
something
unpleasant
in
the
smell
the
auto
suggestion
from
the
other
review
of
vomit
was
impossible
for
me
to
get
by
there
might
be
something
else
there
but
i
could
not
get
to
it
the
first
mouthful
was
awful
it
tasted
of
week
old
dish
water
insueing
tastes
brought
forward
more
of
the
sweet
and
roasted
malt
flavors
that
i
remembered
from
years
past
but
either
my
tastes
have
changed
which
is
highly
likely
or
this
is
a
pale
version
of
the
beer
i
once
loved
i
think
their
water
filtering
and
softening
set
up
has
gone
bye
bye
i
drank
half
a
bottle
while
doing
this
review
and
threw
the
rest
out
it
carried
great
refreshment
and
drinkablility
but
i
was
just
expecting
more
body
maybe
i
got
an
old
or
bad
bottle
ill
have
to
try
this
one
again
and
see
if
the
next
bottle
is
the
same
way
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
an
average
tan
head
that
left
a
nice
lacing
along
the
glass
the
smell
was
full
of
a
dark
chocolate
malt
aroma
as
well
as
some
dark
fruits
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
and
the
taste
was
fairly
well
dominated
by
the
roasted
malts
although
there
were
some
earthy
hops
to
give
it
some
balance
there
was
a
distinctively
chocolate
aftertaste
although
it
was
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
creamy
and
it
drinks
down
quite
easily
my
biggest
complaint
about
this
beer
is
that
on
the
whole
the
flavors
are
good
but
they
lack
the
strength
that
i
was
expecting
from
this
beer
drinkability
if
you
dont
mind
the
hops
this
one
is
downable
for
sure
not
much
wrong
with
this
one
and
it
leaves
little
to
be
desired
got
this
at
coops
and
a
few
other
local
bars
in
new
orleans
poured
a
nice
dark
almost
ruddy
ruby
color
slightly
sweet
nose
with
hint
of
malt
not
much
of
a
head
had
a
really
week
mouth
feel
very
watery
and
thin
but
the
taste
wasnt
bad
slight
bite
not
too
sweet
notes
of
chicory
and
coffee
its
drinkable
id
chug
a
few
of
these
in
new
orleans
with
gator
bites
again
but
its
nothing
id
crave
still
when
the
options
are
the
normal
tap
options
id
definitely
opt
for
this
over
coors
light
or
bud
when
im
nawlins

surprising
definite

slight

i
would
drink
again
but
this
isnt
anything
specia
drinkable
those
who
know
what
a
dunkel
is
will
not
be
satisfied
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
this
poured
a
dark
red
color
with
very
little
head
it
looked
like
a
cherry
coke
there
is
a
malty
taste
at
first
but
i
was
left
with
a
flavor
that
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
my
mouth
became
very
very
dry
i
felt
as
though
i
needed
another
beer
just
to
moisten
up
my
mouth
this
may
have
convinced
me
not
to
try
anything
else
from
dixie
brewing
i
have
yet
to
see
anything
that
constitutes
real
beer
from
them

maltiness
some
bitter

in
the
light
finish
not
bad
a
light
black
this
brewery
got
a
bad
rep
from
having
the
worst
ranked
beer
which
i
remembered
at
the
time
of
consumption
this
one
was
a
surprise
though
it
did
have
a
deeper
taste
that
was
quite
intriguing
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
medium
body
id
have
this
stuff
again
probably
the
beer
poured
a
dark
mahogany
color
there
was
a
small
tan
head
very
minimal
lacing
there
is
a
decent
malt
sweetness
to
the
nose
fairly
sweet
taste
a
hint
of
roastiness
to
it
also
a
good
compliment
to
many
of
the
new
orleans
sytle
dishes
a
good
beer
poured
a
deep
mahogany
and
created
a
minimal
light
caramel
colored
head
that
stayed
a
few
minutes
lacing
was
nice
and
lined
the
glass
to
the
bottom
aroma
was
of
nice
malty
notes
and
a
strange
sweetness
almost
like
toffee
taste
was
smooth
with
malts
leading
the
way
and
staying
throughout
unfortunately
a
metallic
taste
arose
at
the
end
but
faded
as
the
beer
warmed
carbonation
etched
the
throat
a
bit
as
it
went
down
could
be
a
good
session
brew
but
drink
them
slowly
or
youll
fill
up
who
do
the
voodoo
i
do
and
maybe
you
should
too
i
thought
the
voodoo
was
really
good
but
maybe
not
quite
worth
the
high
price
drinkability
a
little
much
for
heavy
quaffing
but
tasty
enough
to
down
2
or
3
hmmm
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
i
remember
a
little
more
roasted
malt
character
and
i
forgot
how
thin
it
seems
for
the
style
starts
out
with
a
fairly
neutral
aroma
with
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
aroma
these
aromas
are
also
the
predominant
flavors
found
in
this
beer
hops
are
in
check
and
the
beer
if
fairly
dry
a
bit
acidic
and
thin
for
the
style
nice
appearance
but
more
of
scharzbierblack
lager
than
a
dunkel
the
bottle
i
had
was
mostly
near
black
with
a
bit
of
ruby
color
at
bottom
of
the
glass
i
still
like
this
beer
as
i
seem
to
recall
having
better
bottles
of
it
but
perhaps
im
just
infatuated
with
the
spooky
label
overall
much
better
than
the
dixiedixie
that
i
just
tried
in
fact
this
was
a
very
pleasant
offering
and
i
rather
enjoyed
this
dark
lager
i
just
wish
they
would
filter
out
those
shrunken
heads
and
chickens

bottling

on

it

was
above
average
with
a
highmedium
body
and
smoothness
i
was
surprised
at
how
quickly
i
drank
this
one
im
still
not
sure
what
i
think
about
this
beer
i
was
intrigued
by
it
due
to
fellow
ba
phantomvodoo
note
the
intentional
misspelling
of
the
name
but
ill
need
to
wait
for
a
few
weeks
and
try
this
again
and
see
if
my
opinion
has
changed
devilishly
dark
clear
pour
with
ruby
highlights
average
tan
head
and
good
lacing
smell
is
sweet
but
rather
dull
taste
is
bettera
bit
crisp
at
the
start
giving
way
to
sweet
malts
and
molasses
early
on
from
that
point
the
taste
fades
in
intensity
more
than
it
changes
in
character
mouthfeel
is
not
nearly
as
syrupy
as
one
might
fear
and
this
is
reasonably
drinkable
as
well
pleasant
but
less
than
bold
cheers
to
budgood
for
the
sample
pours
a
dark
brown
with
amber
hues
head
is
light
brown
with
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
consists
of
hops
chocolate
malt
dark
fruit
raisins
dates
and
theres
a
feint
hint
of
molasses
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
taste
is
rather
uninspiring
hop
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
middle
with
the
finish
having
an
odd
sweetness
to
it
everything
about
the
flavor
seems
set
back
a
bit
with
nothing
really
standing
out
in
particular
not
bad
but
pretty
middle
of
the
road
overall
a
little
beige
head
forms
to
a
half
inch
and
dies
down
but
never
dieing
completely
leaves
light
brown
sparce
lace
in
the
glass
its
a
dark
ruby
color
the
aroma
is
faint
and
of
malt
nuts
and
a
wild
cherry
type
hop
the
flavor
is
malty
and
slightly
smokey
with
a
bitter
after
hop
developing
there
is
some
coffee
and
moss
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
without
objecting
the
darker
swampy
feelings
of
this
beer
i
used
to
like
these
alot
but
i
found
it
to
be
merely
decent
this
time
around
there
seems
to
be
some
body
missing
here
and
also
its
sort
of
unidimentional
i
will
say
this
though
its
damn
drinkable
since
it
leaves
minute
after
taste
and
comes
off
crisp
overall
a
solid
dark
lager
despite
my
dislike
for
the
aroma
does
it
get
extra
points
for
the
cool
name
this
beer
confused
me
quite
a
bit
in
the
end
ive
decided
that
this
is
what
you
would
get
if
you
mixed
a
smoked
porter
or
stout
and
an
ipa
together
its
got
the
coffee
caramel
and
chocolate
overtones
of
the
stout
but
the
hops
of
the
ipa
both
flavors
are
fairly
mild
so
they
dont
war
with
one
another
but
there
is
a
lot
going
on
flavorwise
in
this
beer
the
color
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
light
lacing
and
moderate
carbonation
it
smells
like
a
decent
quality
porter
with
caramel
dominating
the
body
is
very
light
overall
with
the
aforementioned
flavors
an
intriguing
beer
im
still
not
quite
sure
what
i
think
about
it
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
i
was
somewhat
confused
by
this
one
its
a
dark
lager
but
the
taste
is
very
light
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
topped
off
by
an
average
sized
tan
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
a
sticky
lace
the
aroma
has
a
mixture
of
malts
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
the
taste
was
moderately
sweet
and
malty
for
the
style
of
beer
this
was
much
lighter
than
most
other
dunkels
that
ive
tried
still
it
was
a
decent
beer
color
was
an
unexpecting
deepdark
brown
with
some
reddish
tones
great
tan
head
that
was
frothy
and
two
fingers
high
and
lasted
through
most
of
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
barley
very
earthy
and
light
kinda
musty
with
some
floral
hop
notes
taste
is
good
with
a
smooth
caramel
roastyness
and
has
a
hop
presence
has
a
light
medium
body
feel
smooth
with
a
little
twing
of
coffee
sense
along
with
the
a
roasty
dryness
could
be
bolder
but
is
damn
drinkable
i
was
expecting
something
else
more
like
a
becks
dark
or
something
but
was
a
nice
surprise
to
taste
its
own
uniqueness
overall
this
is
a
light
earthly
delight
f
note
this
beer
was
banned
in
texas
due
to
the
name
translating
to
evil
and
louisiana
retaliated
by
banning
lone
star
although
this
beer
isnt
great
compared
to
lone
star
i
think
texas
at
the
time
came
out
the
big
loser
looked
very
much
like
a
portermine
did
have
some
head
to
it
but
faded
quickly
had
some
chocolatyaromas
and
flavors
to
itwas
pretty
thin
compared
to
what
i
thought
it
to
be
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
colorcan
drink
many
of
these
without
filling
up
this
is
a
nice
brewing
effort
this
beer
is
naturally
dark
like
a
porter
and
has
a
delicious
chocolatey
flavor
but
its
a
lager
a
damn
good
lager
at
that
you
definitely
can
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
nice
little
secret
down
south
this
beer
is
dark
like
a
porter
and
tastes
a
little
like
a
porter
but
its
a
lager
it
has
a
good
little
head
to
it
that
lasts
for
a
little
while
the
taste
is
thick
and
rich
of
malty
chocolate
has
a
little
bite
in
the
beginning
but
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
you
have
got
to
try
it
long
live
dixie
brewing
company
the
color
on
the
pour
a
pleasing
ruby
red
and
the
head
modest
in
size
with
a
frothy
texture
and
the
lace
sufficient
to
coat
the
glass
as
required
at
least
by
me
largely
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
sweet
caramel
clean
and
pleasant
enough
start
is
sweet
the
top
skinny
and
the
finish
passably
hopped
and
meaningful
in
its
acidity
dry
aftertaste
and
a
drinkable
average
beer
pours
a
lovely
dark
cranberry
color
with
some
ruby
hues
frothy
tan
and
cherry
colored
head
leaves
a
nice
lace
nose
of
honey
black
liqorice

notes

crisp
on
the
tongue
i
dont
think
ive
tasted
a
dark
lager
with
any
similar
flavors
before
as
it
warms
a
bit
it
gets
a
bit
harsh
drink
it
cold
and
enjoy
the
flavor
profile
an
interesting
lager
to
say
the
least
pours
a
very
dark
brownish
amber
color
with
a
mediumfoamy
and
sticky
offwhite
head
nose
is
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
with
some
floral
notes
roasted
malts
really
come
through
in
the
flavor
with
notes
of
coffee
and
vanilla
fairly
light
in
the
mouth
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
one
good
beer
nice
aroma
and
color
very
drinkably
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
color
with
a
tan
head
and
nice
lace
that
goes
all
the
way
down
the
glass
floral
hop
aroma
with
some
malt
and
a
slight
roast
smell
medium
body
and
a
light
mouthfeel
rich
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
fruit
toast
and
caramel
hops
are
not
nearly
as
present
in
taste
as
they
are
in
aroma
very
drinkable
nice
dark
ruby
color
that
had
moderate
longlasting
head
with
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
big
hops
which
smelled
nice
but
overpowered
the
malt
the
flavor
was
fairly
simpleroastedcoffee
like
the
malt
was
almost
nonexistent
and
the
hops
were
not
as
prominent
as
they
were
in
the
aroma
but
still
there
so
the
taste
was
good
but
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
yet
the
flavor
lingered
a
not
outstanding
beer
but
a
welcome
change
from
the
macros
and
very
drinkable
due
to
the
lightness
and
good
flavor
very
dark
brownish
in
color
with
brilliant
ruby
highlights
and
a
creamy
tan
head
that
drops
quickly
but
leaves
a
very
good
lace
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
hoppy
quite
floral
with
some
light
toasty
maltiness
beneath
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
level
is
moderate
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
zesty
the
flavor
is
fairly
rich
with
some
limited
dark
fruitiness
and
a
toasty
and
gently
caramel
maltiness
however
the
hop
flavor
is
much
more
limited
than
the
aroma
suggests
it
finishes
quick
and
dry
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
it
develops
a
slight
bittersweet
chocolate
quality
an
interesting
beer
that
is
well
worth
trying
imho
dixies
best
beer
it
would
also
make
a
great
crossover
beer
at
summer
bbqs
or
holiday
get
togethers
dark
and
malty
but
very
carbonated
it
didnt
exaclty
fit
with
the
look
and
flavor
of
the
beer
being
a
fan
of
dark
beers
it
was
kind
of
a
letdown
as
a
schwarzbier
however
it
had
a
nice
flavor

thanks
to
johnnyboy
for
providing
this
sample
via
a
friends
visit
to
the
big
easy
deep
blackish
color
nice
almosthoppy
aroma
tastes
awful
it
has
a
chemical
taste
like
when
youve
been
at
the
cleaners
too
long
oily
clinging
flavor
that
is
not
a
pleasant
hopsoil
but
more
of
a
sticky
bad
taste
that
just
will
not
go
away
as
it
warms
up
it
does
not
get
any
better
pass
it
by
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
amber
color
it
formed
a
light
tan
head
that
left
some
lace
the
aroma
was
of
herb
and
malt
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
some
herb
the
overall
finish
was
a
touch
bitter
i
found
the
body
to
be
a
bit
weak
really
not
a
lot
that
impressed
me
with
this
one
dark
deep
brown
and
clear
off
white
head
lasts
for
a
decnet
time
small
lace
traces
down
the
glass
smells
lightly
roasted
with
a
hint
of
spice
tasts
somewhat
sweet
and
rich
chewey
almost
slight
smoke
flavor
contradicts
the
clovecinamon
spice
hard
to
make
this
a
session
beer
but
worth
a
try
a
clear
deep
amber
head
is
about
12
of
an
inch
but
pretty
fleeting
sweet
aroma
a
little
like
honey
flavor
is
very
sweet
too
sweet
phenolic
with
some
notes
of
vanilla
hops
seem
to
impart
a
cinnamonlike
zest
but
not
enough
to
balance
the
brew
finishes
light
interesting
but
not
a
favorite
of
mine
head
is
initially
average
sized
frothy
offwhite
mostly
diminishing
body
is
dark
brown
but
when
light
hits
it
the
color
turns
into
an
interesting
dark
ruby
color
pleasant
on
the
nose
with
aromas
containing
moderate
notes
caramel
toasted
light
bread
herbs
and
notes
of
vanilla
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
vanilla
and
caramel
tones
a
little
acidic
overall
this
was
very
interesting
and
an
enjoyable
brew
the
attractive
tan
head
tops
a
deep
garnet
and
very
clear
brew
an
attractive
lace
is
left
down
the
glass
theres
a
sweet
caramel
malt
as
well
as
mild
coffee
like
chocolate
malt
in
aroma
but
theres
a
mild
herbal
hop
nose
as
well
its
definitely
got
a
more
complex
aroma
compared
to
other
examples
of
the
style
the
smooth
easy
going
mouthfeel
and
light
body
provide
for
good
drinkability
flavorwise
this
is
more
assertive
than
the
typical
boring
american
dark
lager
hop
bitterness
is
above
the
norm
and
roasted
grain
flavors
are
mellow
but
arent
hidden
although
not
a
particularly
complex
brew
this
is
much
better
than
average
for
style
pretty
tasty
id
say
it
was
ink
colored
but
its
not
that
bad
it
has
a
good
toaster
mollases
taste
to
it
but
a
bit
thin
i
had
it
in
new
orleans
during
a
nice
hot
day
it
was
served
overly
cold
which
probably
took
away
from
my
enjoyment
of
the
beer
but
helped
me
through
the
day
it
smells
like
a
hersey
bar
a
light
bodied
dark
lager
probably
has
more
of
a
cult
following
rather
than
being
sustained
on
its
own
merit
attractive
color
however
its
lack
of
depth
is
a
bit
misleading
a
black
beer
which
is
lighter
in
taste
than
color
mildly
hopped
with
caramel
notes
despite
its
color
this
lager
is
actually
fairly
light
and
pretty
good
as
a
hot
weather
beer
deep
brown
pour
into
sapp
with
dark
beige
head
great

chocolate

nose
roasted
malt
flavor
and
lite

finish
is
like
cocoawheats

when
we
were
kids
tasty
a
deeper
malt
character
i
wasnt
sure
of
the
bottle
date
perhaps
the
beer
was
past
its
prime
although
this
is
a
german
beer
i
have
tasted
a
number
of
american
brewed
schwarzbiers
which
are
heavier
and
with
more
flavor
overall
this
is
one
smooth
malty
sweet
german
lager
similar
in
flavor
to
kostrizters
schwarzbier
but
little
earthier
best
beer
ive
ever
had
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
light

this
one
is
nice
and
though
the
scent
is
very

the
taste

winds

i
hated
to
break
the
seal
on
this
wonderful
bottle
but
once
it
was
popped
and
the
swing
top
swung
i
began
the
pour
in
earnest
the
pseudocascade
was
quick
and
formed
a

dense
deeptan

looked
like
a

was
opaqueblack

with
nequality

at

edges
nose
had
a
pronounced
maltiness
almost
like
being
in
the
malt
room
itself
it
was
earthy
slightly
grassy
and
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
mmm
i
broke
out
the
pretzels
for
this
one
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
the
taste
was
chocolaty
slightly
grassy
eminently
drinkable
finish
was
semisweet
with
the
malt
really
leading
the
way
but
not
so
aggressively
as
to
be
cloying
overall
this
is
exactly
what
the
elders
in
this
application
say
it
is
an
outstanding
schwartzbier
schwarzbier
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
rich
smokey
malt
aroma
with
small
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
has
a
very
rich
thick
and
creamy
malt
flavor
good
peated
flavors
the
body
is
rather
watery
but
still
some
nice
flavors
overall
a
very
flavorful
beer
the
only
knock
is
the
watery
body
overall
very
well
done
brew
noticeable
roasted
malt
notes
are
kept
in
check
yet
still
very
prevalent
running
caramel
licorice
sweetness
throughout
provides
lighter
tones
for
the
palate
an
affordable
bottle
that
is
a
great
benchmark
for
the
style
overall
a
real
clean
and
refreshing
schwarzbier
good
one
to
know
about
but
probably
enjoy
kostritzer
a
bit
more
monchshof
is
one
of
my
favorite
schwarzbiers
out
there
its
not
as
complex
as
some
but
the
drinkability
and
enjoyment
factor
are
off
the
charts
i
could
drink
this
by
the
case
and
do
find
myself
buying
it
often
if
you
havent
had
this
beer
yet
and
are
a
fan
of
the
style
get
some
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
overall
i
recommend
this
to
everyone
i
felt
like
drinking
another
on
my
way
home
in
the
cab
but
i
didnt
have
one
to
drink
its
quite
a
nice
brew
and
it
complements
german
schnitzel
and
kraut
its
one
the
best
schwarzbiers
ive
had
cheers
a
nice
example
fresh
and
tasty
great
stuff
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
hue
in
color
with
a
1finger
beige
foamy
head
lots
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
even
better
and
very
smooth
with
bittersweet
chocolate
that
is
perfectly
done
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
perfect
carbonation
a
great
brew
there
really
should
be
more
schwarzbiers
in
the
world
or
at
least
more
of
the
existing
ones
should
be
available
to
me
monchshof
rauchbier
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
hue
with
an
off
white
puffy
head
great
lacing
and
overall
appearance
ive
had
this
a
few
times
once
on
tap
now
i
am
reviewing
the
bottled
experience
the
aroma
is
so
full
of
roasty
malts
its
almost
savory
very
mouthwatering
the
splendid
taste
had
more
of
the
aforementioned
aspects
as
well
as
chicory
and
coffee
and
some
faint
hops
all
very
very
balanced
and
smooth
what
a
full
mouth
feel
one
gets
with
this
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
truly
a
triumph
of
a
schwarzbier
definitely
my
new
favorite
of
the
style
i
love
german
beer
order
it
with
confidence
and
have
a
couple
at
only
4
9
prost
had
cocoa
and
hops
taste
dark
smell
with
a
little
tobacco
hint
good
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
when
i
first
saw
it
i
thought
it
was
going
to
taste
like
a
stout
or
a
bach
bier
i
was
happily
surprised
with
my
first
drink
drink
this
one
slow
to
enjoy
every
drop
o
not
complex
but
enjoyable
it
remindes
me
of
a
light
porter
if
there
is
such
a
thing
rjt
a
nice
alternative
to
a
lager
o
although
not
super
complex
that
is
what
the
style
calls
for
the
balance
of
front
flavor
and
mellowing
backend
makes
it
a
great
session
beer
wonderful
dark
rich
warm
everything
you
want
in
a
dark
beer
nothing
heavy
or
cloying
smell
taste
and
finish
are
all
clean
almost
crisp
if
that
makes
sense
with
such
a
rich
brew
just
delicious
sip
on
its
own
or
pair
with
strong
tasting
foods
i
tried
it
with
huntsman
cheese
stilton
and
gruyere
and
roasted
brussels
sprouts
and
although
it
sounds
odd
it
was
a
superb
match
this
is
a
lighter
bodied
black
beer
true
to
the
style
it
has
subtle
sweetness
with
super
creamy
mouth
feel
very
enjoyable
and
was
a
big
hit
with
this
party
o
a
great
tasting
beer
but
out
of
balance
which
leaves
me
wishing
for
more
hops
the
roasty
flavors
are
great
the
malty
goodness
up
front
the
coffee
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
poured
black
into
a
weizen
glass
with
a
nice
creamy
off
white
head
nice
roasted
aroma
and
full
mouth
feel
taste
consisted
of
coffee
notes
with
roasted
chocolate
and
slight
licorice
the
best
part
was
it
was
not
overly
heavy
making
it
a
great
session
beer
overall
a
very
delightful
beer
and
one
i
will
definitely
have
again
fairly
black
in
terms
of
body
tan
head
sits
atop
for
quite
some
time
great
retention
and

slight

some
sweeter
almost

more
pils
hopping
some
mineral
quality
to
the

light

in

light

lower
medium
carbonation
a
very
good
schwarz
probably
the
truest
schwarz
ive
had
in
the
vein
of
the
black
pils
descriptor
o
this
is
the
first
beer
in
a
while
to
really
blow
me
away
unexpectedly
the
combination
of
flavor
richness
balance
and
the
creamy
mouth
feel
makes
this
a
real
winner
proof
that
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
super
extreme
to
kick
ass
a
new
fave
very
nice
beer
to
sample
super
smooth
on
the
tongue
a
light
carbonation
provides
lift
the
experience
is
cleansing
and
very
accomplished
o
this
beer
was
a
nice
surprise
to
me
definitely
one
of
the
best
schwartzbiers
that
i
have
been
able
to
try
highly
recommended
o
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
great
beer
a
good
summer
afternoon
beer
however
it
lacks
the
pop
i
had
hoped
for
this
beer
pours
a
black
w
a
two
finger
super
dense
cocoa
head
major
pop
when
the
top
comes
off
this
one
like
a
gunshot
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
my
cbs
snifter
the
nose
is
roasted
malt
nuts
and
maybe
some
cocoa
in
there
not
a
super
strong
nose
but
very
balanced
and
pleasant
the
taste
follows
the
nose
profile
with
a
little
bite
hiding
beyond
all
the
malty
goodness
feel
is
medium
super
smooth
and
silky
malt
dominates
throughout
overall
this
is
a
very
laid
back
malty
solid
brew
definitely
a
good
session
brew
that
id
have
again
cheers
notes
an
amazing
lager
even
though
there
are
not
alot
of
schwarzbiers
this
is
a
remarkable
treat
and
i
will
pick
this
one
up
again
cheers
taste
is
really
good
underlying
sweetness
roasted
presence
but
not
that
much
very
balanced
and
smooth
goes
down
very
well
good
german
lager
o
on
the
whole
this
isnt
a
beer
that
will
totally
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
is
very
drinkable
especially
if
you
like
schwarzbiers
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
notes
a
balanced
complex
schwarzbier
that
is
very
drinkable
and
sophisticated
intensity
of
flavors
is
moderate
for
the
style
flavor
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
theres
brisk
bitterness
with
just
an
edge
of
nutty
roasty
goodness
quite
thin
like
the
lager
that
it
is
what
this
beer
lacks
in
depth
of
flavor
it
makes
up
for
in
the
perfection
of
its
ingredients
and
their
execution
o
i
confess
i
bought
this
beer
for
the
bottle
and
was
really
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
of
a
style
that
i
dont
normally
like
this
is
definitely
the
best
swartzbier
that
i
have
ever
had
i
will
buy
a
few
more
of
these
both
for
the
bottles
and
for
the
easy
drinkability
serving
type

mf
nice
moderate

beer
with
just
a
slight
amount

a
very

is
medium
light
it
has
a
very
noticeable
toast

without

presence
it
is
well
balanced
nice
end
wich
brings
to
the
front
some
bitterness
very
nice
overall
a
tasty
beer
i
will
drink
again
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
and
subtle
chocolate
and
nuts
lager
crispness
and
light
body
doesnt
linger
at
all
easy
to
drink
very
nice
version
of
a
schwarz
may
the
schwarz
be
with
you
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
this
is
my
new
favorite
schwarzbier
quite
easy
to
drink
lots
of
flavor
carbonation
is
pretty
high
here
and
the
low
abv
leads
to
a
mostly
modest
palate
impact
however
for
the
style
its
still
pretty
roastforward
on
the
tongue
and
quite
an
enjoyable
ride
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
maybe
on
the
lighter
side
with
more
crispness
than
smoothness
o
a
really
good
german
made
black
lager
here
if
you
want
to
get
into
schwarzbiers
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
start
german

ftw
will
buy
again
this

and
very

dark

considering

i
could

sit
on

some

lagers

a

powdery
and
tannic
moderate
carbonation
upfront
but
tingles
in

pretty

maybe
thats
the

asskicking
this
one
pours
a
deep
brown
with

had
a
decent

with

initial
aroma
was
of
coffee
that
turned
to
slightly
burnt
chocolate
with
hints
of
black
peppercorns
tastes
like
a
light
porter
with
a
toastychocolaty
finish
great
carbonation
with
a
surprisingly
light
mouth
feel
initially
the
mouthfeel
comes
off
as
thin
but
the
carbonation
amps
things
up
midway
through
i
think
i
could
enjoyably
polish
off
a
couple
pints
of
this
brew
with
some
pork
or
a
good
steak
delicious
even
if
it
isnt
overly
complex
smell
not
that
dramatic
mild
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
good
malty
a
little
sweet
at
first
but
the
sweetness
is
cut
back
by
semisweet
chocolate
and
probably
some
mild
hops
for
balance
mouthfeel
is
about
average
crisp
and
smooth
not
thin
or
watery
drinkability
is
good
low
abv
combined
with
a
good
balanced
taste
make
this
one
a
winner
overall
this
is
a
very
cool
beer
easy
to
drink
complex
flavors
and
something
new
it
seems
in
every
pull
its
a
dark
brew
but
it
drinks
more
like
a
lager
or
lighter
ale
very
good
pours
a
clear
dark
copperish
color
with
light
lacing
and
head
smell
is
like
bandaids
and
malt
taste
is
roasty
but
very
thin
and
watery
almost
old
and
stale
tasting
just
a
mess
wouldnt
recommend
this
based
on
my
sample
of
this
beer
at
all
drinkability
is
high
ill
be
getting
some
more
for
sure
i
love

is

beer
with

it

head
that
makes

its
aroma
is
doughy
nutty
and
toasty
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
light
bitter
hops
sneaking
through
nutty
and
roasted
flavors
its
light
to
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and

the

the
roasted

this

boasts
a
complementary
phrase
by
michael
jackson
with
our
without
his
praise
i
recognize
the
quality
of
the
brew
but
lack
the
same
degree
of
enthusiasm
as
he
the
beer
pours
a
wonderfully
dark
brown
color
with
nice
clarity
creamy
head
formation
and
stubborn
12
retention
laces
well
aromas
a
light
on
the
roasted
end
giving
a
chalky
powdery
scent
a
boost
of
light
caramel
supplies
the
scent
of
malt
but
no
real
hops
detected
in
the
nose
flavors
of
wellattenuated
caramel
malt
sets
the
stage
while
the
black
malts
give
a
mild
dry
coffeelike
nuance
to
the
edges
hopped
only
to
offset
sweetness
the
hops
to
marry
into
the
bitterness
of
black
malt
well
for
a
complex
bitterness
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
light
caramel
flavor
texture
is
medium
better
than
most
lighter
schwarzbiers
powdery
chalky
and
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
light
linger
of
coffee
and
caramel
not
my
everyday
beer
but
pleasant
nonetheless
overall
a
very
good
schwarzbier
as
good
as
any
ive
tried
recommended
overall
this
is
the
best
schwarzbier
that
ive
ever
tasted
and
one
of
the
best
beers
regardless
of
category
that
ive
had
this
beer
had
an
amberishblack
color
to
it
with
an
overall
medium
head
the
aromas
were
permeating
the
sweet
smells
of
caramel
and
wheat
with
a
roasty
feel
the
taste
was
a
mix
of
fruity
wheat
and
and
bitterish
hop
greatness
it
was
thick
and
full
bodied
yet
surprisingly
light
making
it
a
great
beer
to
try
out
if
you
do
not
like
heavy
drinks
overall
this
was
very
good
may
the
schwarz
be
with
you
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
plus
creamy
tannish
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
slight
roast
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
slight
sweetness
as
well
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
surprised
me
this
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
taste
is
sweeter
than
i
expected
rather
licoricelike
toasty
then
a
bit
bitter
then
mostly
gone
leaving
only
a
lingering
tangy
bitterness
like
underripe
fruit
the
abrupt
finish
actually
makes
this
more
drinkable
than
i
was
expecting
especially
with
the
sweetness
up
front
i
like
this
quite
a
lot
and
see
it
as
a
better
representation
of
the
style
than
some
of
the
other
schwarzbiere
ive
had
which
seemed
more
like
watereddown
porters
than
their
own
distinctive
type
the
beer
drinks
easy
and
is
not
heavy
at
all
really
enjoyed
the
complex
flavors
a
very
good
schwarz
but
not
the
best
klosterbrauerei
very
nice
east
drinker
that
is
generally
sweet
but
its
not
overpowering
beacuse
its
reined
in
by
a
dry
hop
finish
very
nice
overall
i
recommend
the
party
keg
of
it
also
because
in
the
highly
unlikelihood
that
you
dont
finish
it
its
there
the
next
day
very
consistent
taste
and
pour
all
evening
may
the
schwarz
be
with
you
pours
pretty
much
black
with
a
dark
creamy
head
good
malt
and
nut
flavor
and
also
something
very
sweet
and
almost
sugarlike
that
i
cant
identify
very
drinkable
doesnt
not
make
the
mistake
of
being
too
heavy
perhaps
a
little
under
carbonated
and
lacking
in

poured
to
a

color
with
some
red
and
orange
highlights
when
looking
at
it
with
a
light
behind
has
a
nice
think
pillow
of
a
head
that
is
tan
in
color
excellent
retention
stuck
around
for
most
of
the
beer
and
left
a
nice
amount
of
thing
lacing
lines
the
aroma
is
very
inviting
fantastic
roasted
notes
with
some
chocolate
nut
and
earthy
characteristics
the
aromas
alone
for
this
brew
make
it
very
enticing
the
flavor
was
excellent
as
well
the
roasted
flavors
mix
really
well
with
the
chocolate
and
caramel
flavors
extremely
easy
drinking
based
on
the
flavors
present
the
finish
is
nice
and
dry
leaving
you
wanting
more
the
only
knock
about
this
brew
is
that
to
me
it
seems
a
little
thin
but
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
good
brew
and
a
excellent
rendition
of
this
style
will
get
this
one
gain
as
it
is
solid
some
other
schwartzbiers
that
i
have
had
lately
have
been
nothing
but
a
disappointment
d
very
tasty
a
little
light
good
flavors
but
just
slightly
thin
would
definitely
drink
this
again
next
time
im
in
germany
ill
be
happy
to
have
it
fresher
pours
black
with
a
nice
crème
head
nose
is
very
malty
with
a
sweet
tone
to
it
flavor
is
beautiful
robust
thick
malts
that
seem
to
have
a
spice
to
it
abound
on
the
end
i
get
some
nice
coffee
tones
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
and
a
thick
liquid
feel
nice
and
hearty
and
thick
well
worth
trying
and
even
better
on
the
bottle
as
i
have
had
it
on
tap
before
drinkability
a
fairly
easydrinking
competent
schwarzbier
light
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
this
is
real
smooth
in
the
mouth
a
good
drinkable
schwarz
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
not
a
bad
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
sniffer
it
had
a
dark
brown
color
with
relative
clearity
for
being
a
schwarzbier
the
aroma
had
a
perceived
sweetness
in
combination
with
a
grainy
cereal
quality
the
flavor
was
very
smooth
slightly
dry
with
hints
of
spice
and
sourness
because
of
its
smooth
lagered
taste
this
beer
has
amazing
drinkabillity
it
pours
a
black
duh
color
with
a
light
tan
fluffy
head
the
head
is
sort
of
retentive
but
there
isnt
much
to
keep
it
aloft
since
the
carbonation
is
quite
mild
the
aroma
is
dry
mild
hops
and
toasted
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
very
faint
watered
down
caramel
notes
mild
hops
and
rye
toast
that
keeps
it
short
and
sweet
with
every
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
good
not
much
residual
sweetness
or
char
this
provides
a
decent
drinkability
the
only
thing
that
would
eventually
draw
me
away
from
this
one
would
be
boredom
poured
from
a
fliptop
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
nice
dark
brown
color
very
creamylooking
that
head
really
lasts
a
long
time
intial
smell
of
malts
caramels
faint
leather
taste
is
really
good
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
spaten
optimator
but
no
heavy
mouthfeel
you
get
all
the
flavors
of
bockscoffes
caramels
chocolate
malts
but
without
the
sticky
mouthfeel
i
like
this
lighter
quality
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
taste
is
mild
burned
with
coffee
notes
and
a
light
maltbitter
the
malt
is
also
present
and
is
light
and
fresh
a
typical
bottom
fermented
beer
with
a
clean
profile
this
really
tastes
like
a
colored
lager
body
is
quite
thin
and
could
be
a
little
bigger
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
elements
of
the
beer
come
together
to
make
it
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
i
wish
i
had
more
but
i
only
bought
the
1
bottle
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
poured
black
with
a
thin
head
that
faded
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
very
malty
and
dry
and
with
a
hint
of
powdery
yeast
at
the
end
the
taste
is
smooth
light
chocolatey
powdery
and
with
slowly
building
bitterness
on
the
finish
although
this
is
fairly
subtle
quite
a
gentle
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
this
beer
is
very
easy
drinking
the
perfect
brew
to
dispel
the
myth
of
strong
dark
brews
for
those
too
intimidated
to
try
a
dark
beer
i
decided
to
start
tonite
off
w
a
schwartz
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
w
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
which
barely
fit
in
my
18
6
oz
snifter
it
dissapated
rather
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
a
fairly
light
aroma
some
roasted
malt
w
hop
aroma
faint
yeasty
esters
as
well
a
chocolaty
roasted
malt
taste
w
a
slght
hop
undertone
not
as
crisp
as
some
schwarzs
a
little
thin
tasting
a
light
bodied
semidry
palate
a
little
unbalanced
w
the
weaker
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
at
4
9
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
all
in
all
although
im
more
of
a
belgium
and
american
ipa
fan
i
could
easily
live
with
being
stranded
on
an
island
with
an
unlimited
supply
of
this
beer
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
maybe
not
worth
the
price
but
still
quite
good
overall
impression
wow
a
very
impressive
beer
i
love
the
malt
complexity
with
the
background
hop
bitterness
to
balance
no
harsh
roastiness
and
a
rich
color
immensely
enjoyable
and
strongly
recommended
had
this
at
mellow
mushroom
tonight
to
be
honest
was
suprised
when
i
saw
it
in
the
cooler
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
poured
a
rich
deep
dark
brown
essentially
black
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
of
around
an
inch
this
nestled
down
to
just
a
ring
around
the
top
and
some
decent
side
glass
lace
a
good
burnt
grain
aroma
coming
off
of
it
a
touch
of
caramel
with
some
nuttiness
to
it
the
taste
was
nice
and
smoked
very
well
done
not
over
powering
at
all
just
enough
of
a
hint
of
it
against
the
grain
back
to
let
you
know
it
was
there
a
touch
of
yeast
in
the
front
and
a
dry
finish
great
light
feel
and
a
medium
bidy
went
down
well
with
amble
carbonation
i
easily
could
have
had
another
but
they
charged
way
too
much
for
the
one
bottle
to
begin
with
overall
this
was
more
then
decent
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
will
have
to
check
out
some
local
stores
to
see
if
i
can
find
it
cheaper
as
this
would
make
a
great
little
brew
to
have
around
sometime
d
quite
drinkable
indeed
with
a
solid
array
of
flavor
that
still
maintains
balance
definitely
tops
other
schwarzbiers
ive
tasted
in
terms
of
keeping
the
palate
engaged
but
maintaining
the
subtleties
of
a
lager
thierry
16102007
poured
this
nice
beer
into
a
tumbler
at
fifty
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
rich
dark
brown
with
a
great
tan
head
and
awsome
lacing
the
smell
was
of
roasted
coffee
the
taste
was
the
same
and
heavy
chocolate
that
was
nice
and
toasty
roasty
the
head
did
decay
kida
fast
though
very
nice
beer
and
i
will
buy
again
d
the
very
definition
of
quaffable
refreshing
during
the
day
and
replenishing
at
night
taste
medium
body
with
a
ton
of
beautiful
roasted
malts
prevalent
throughout
a
tiny
bit
of
hops

through
for
balance
finishes
dry
with
a
nice
roasted
flavor

i
think
beautiful
dark
molassas
colored
beer
help
up
to
the
light
it
reminded
me
of
root
beer
just
enough
head
for
full
coverage
with
little
to
no
lacing
i
loved
the
smell
of
this
beer
light
and
sweet
roasty
malt
and
a
nice
nuttiness
that
reminded
me
of
hazelnuts
i
love
the
taste
even
more
perhaps
it
was
complimented
by
the
delicious
roast
duck
tenders
that
arrived
at
the
same
time
but
this
just
seemed
almost
too
refreshing
for
a
beer
with
its
dark
color
maltiness
up
front
mixing
with
the
hazelnut
mid
palatte
finishing
clean
with
noble
hops
my
mouth
was
very
happy
with
me
for
choosing
this
beer
smooth
and
refreshing
velvety
and
clean
at
once
i
would
love
to
have
this
beer
again
and
again
next
time
i
think
ill
get
a
liter
the
late
michael
jackson
was
right
as
stated
on
the
label
of
this
beer
definitely
worldclass
in
my
opinion
was
lucky
enough
to
have
this
ontap
in
its
own
branded
mug
at
chef
pauls
in
lisle
almost
black
in
color
but
with
nice
clarity
if
held
up
to
the
light
this
had
a
smoky
roasty
sweet
malt
aroma
which
was
not
offputting
actually
if
this
were
not
summer
i
probably
would
have
given
it
higher
marks
in
the
smell
dept
hard
to
judge
in
that
respect
as
im
usually
not
partial
to
smoky
dark
roasty
aromasflavors
this
had
a
nice
malt
sweetness
that
was
balanced
out
by
the
dark
roasty
flavors
and
finished
crisp
nice
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
for
such
a
complex
beer
that
weighs
in
at
under
5
poured
into
a
glass
its
a
lighter
black
body
with
a
creamy
head
the
smell
brings
out
fudge
and
brownies
grain
and
a
little
rust
this
beer
is
a
little
sweeter
than
others
of
this
style
and
that
makes
this
a
winner
in
my
book
hinted
with
more
fudge
and
raisin
notes
the
bitterness
is
light
on
the
palate
and
is
lifted
after
a
brief
stay
this
was
almost
like
drinking
a
chocolate
brownie
shake
its
a
damn
smooth
beer
i
was
even
tempted
to
make
a
float
out
of
the
last
half
of
this
beer
i
might
save
that
experiment
for
another
day
on
the
bottle
this
beer
refers
to
itself
as
the
black
pilsner
in
that
realm
this
matches
the
profile
superbly
however
for
my
tastes
i
prefer
fuller
bodied
beers
with
more
complex
flavors
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
lager
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
but
otherwise
this
beer
would
be
great
with
a
nice
steak
dinner
a
good
option
i
wanted
it
for
smaller
6
oz
servings
and
to
see
how
long
it
would
keep
in
the
beer

the

decent
a

less
than
a

tall
the
body
is
very
dark
and
almost
completely
opaque

for
tiny
shades
of
the
deepest
burgundy
around
the
base
of
the

slightly
yeasty
hefe
wiese
yeasty
lager
yeasty
with
subtle
notes
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
very
clean
no
fruit
in
the
nose
obviously
because
of
lager
fermentation
taste
is
not
terribly
out
going
or
crazy
flavorful
very
smooth
and
subtle
the
flavor
play
really
operates
on
a
low
level
roasted

is
present
with
notes
of
biscuit
with
a
slight
caramel
hint
hops
are
detectable
to
ward
the
middle
end
of
the
drink
very
easy
drinking
beer
alcohol
is
low
enough
to
put
a
few
back
but
i
do
wish
it
was
a
tad
more
forward
and
less
subdued
totally
drinkable
and
worth
trying
out
d
a
very
good
beer
quite
drinkable
to
me
an
ideal
gateway
beer
to
turn
bmc
drinkers
on
to
their
different
options
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
hard
to
find
this
beer
on
beer
advocate
cant
figure
out
how
to
spell
it
with
the
o
anyway
tried
this
out
from
a
fellow
carolina
brewmaster
at
our
annual
memorial
day
bbq
cam
eout
of
a
flip
top
bottle
not
a
very
dark
schwarzbier
smells
like
roasted
malt
coffee
and
caramel
taste
and
finish
thin
body
nothing
great
but
glad
i
tried
it
overall
an
enjoyable
schwarzbier
good
drinkability
opinion
this
is
a
really
refreshing
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
a
schwarzbier
i
believe
that
i
was
fortunate
to
have
a
pretty
fresh
example
of
this
beer
as
it
shows
no
signs
of
oxidation
or
age
that
you
often
get
with
swingtops
i
didnt
feel
cheated
in
any
way
with
such
a
low
gravity
beer
and
i
would
certainly
drink
this
one
again
give
it
a
shot
if
it
is
available
in
your
area
special
thanks
to
amanda
at
goodbar
for
the
sample
tastes
really
malty
with
a
sweetness
to
it
the
beverage
is
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
not
too
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
others
in
the
style
i
have
had
are
thin
and
have
a
strong
alcohol
presence
but
this
is
not
thin
or
thick
and
is
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
id
drink
again
though
i
think
it
wouldve
been
much
better
had
i
drained
this
keg
in
one
day
as
opposed
to
letting
it
sit
over
night
its
lost
quite
a
bit
of
its
carbonation
id
really
like
to
try
it
from
the
bottle
feels
clean
in
the
mouth
with
a
mediumlight
body
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
overall
a
beer
that
is
highly
sessionable
with
a
nice
malty
taste
what
a
wonderful
beer
kulmbacher
is
slowly
becoming
my
favorite
nonamerican
brewery
with
their
solid
offerings
this
was
a
lush
treat
admittedly
unexpected
in
its
depth
yet
crisp
clean
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
lite
porter
but
its
dry
crispness
ease
of
drinking
set
it
apart
a
wonderful
beer
for
a
summers
evening
i
could
see
it
paring
beautifully
with
a
killer
chargrilled
steak
or
even
a
big
ol
burger
as
well
as
a
iced
chocolate
dessert
if
you
like
deep
rich
almost
lush
schwarzbiers
or
even
porters
definitely
check
this
out
i
recommend
it
highly
drinkable
yes
but
a
bit
bottle
in
it
other
wise
good
drinkability
great
flavor
fine
sessionability
and
a
reasonable
price
a
very
good
black
beer
yes
lots
of
dark
malt
and
roast
no
coffee
nor
chocolate
just
balanced
well
carbonated
a
good
scattering
of
lace
easy
drinking
mid
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
on
the
sweet
side
though
dry
finish
and
a
bit
peppery
good
brewery
liked
it
very
light
and
refreshing
schwarzbier
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
very
dark
until
held
to
the
light
which
reveals
dark
crimsonruby
highlights
there
is
very
little
head
to
speak
of
smell
is
sweet
mostly
of
lightly
toasted
amber
malt
slightly
of
cherries
and
chocolate
the
taste
has
a
good
amount
of
depth
with
lots
of
layers
of
flavor
to
start
there
is
a
slightly
sweet
maltyness
followed
by
an
acidic
slightly
burnt
malt
bitterness
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
not
dense
and
has
little
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
enjoyable
as
well
with
portishead
on
the
hifi
it
is
time
to
break
into
this
bottle
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
for
aroma
there
is
not
much
to
smell
again
my
sense
of
smell
is
not
that
great
for
taste
it
is
ok
a
bit
watery
but
there
is
some
flavor
coffee
caramel
and
toffee
not
as
bold
as
i
would
like
for
my
first
ever
schwarzbier
it
was
not
bad
and
i
will
try
another
thanks
to
james
at
beverly
wine
beer
for
picking
this
one
a
nice
classic
schwartzbier
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
the
aroma
isnt
strong
but
i
can
smell
roasted
malt
caramel
and
some
chocolate
it
tastes
like
roasted
grain
and
bittersweet
chocolate
but
finishes
bitter
and
a
little
bit
acidic
mouthfeel
is
light
and
its
smooth
and
dry
drinkability
is
good
i
think
its
nice
and
refreshing
and
its
easy
to
drink
its
a
good
schwarzbier
id
definitely
buy
it
again
i
think
it
would
be
a
decent
choice
as
a
session
beer
too
recommended
pours
a
very
deep
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
coffeefoam
head
perched
atop
the
body
tons
of
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
but
also
bitter
chocolate
and
a
winey
acidity
very
bitter
without
being
acrid
on
the
tongue
considerable
acidity
kicks
things
off
and
stays
on
the
tongue
throughout
while
bitter
chocolate
and
dark
bread
crust
notes
come
and
go
before
the
bitterness
makes
for
a
finish
thats
quite
dry
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
feel
fuller
than
it
actually
is
it
seems
pretty
low
in
gravity
and
very
smooth
the
lager
thing
overall
this
is
an
excellent
schwarzbier
rich
in
flavor
but
small
enough
to
be
sessionable
very
good
if
simple
flavor
execution
drinkability
a
tasty
dark
brew
light
yet
roasty
interesting
and
midly
complex
overall
quality
a
pretty
decent
schwarzbier
brown
pour
with
a
fizzy
brown
head
transparent
and
dark
red
when
held
up
to
a
light
very
sweet
and
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
nicely
carbonated
with
a
mildly
fruity
flavor
up
front
with
some
nutty
roasty
characteristics
mellow
and
rich
with
a
nice
bitterness
finishes
with
an
earthy
hop
bite
quite
a
tasty
beer
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
amber
tones
and
has
a
creamy
two
finger
head
it
leaves
a
good
amount
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
buttery
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
varies
from
coffee
to
charcoal
and
chicory
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
the
finish
and
a
hint
of
spice
pepper
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
and
somewhat
dry
by
the
end
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
its
complex
on
the
palate
yet
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
loves
a
good
beer
first
off
the
bottle
is
a
keeper
nothing
is
more
fun
than
impressing
your
macroloving
buddies
by
popping
a
flip
top
from
germany
and
pouring
a
nice
glass
of
black
bliss
monschshof
looks
good
literally
as
it
is
coming
out
of
the
bottle
it
pours
a
dark
potent
brownblack
with
a
gorgeous
tan
head
that
disappates
quickly
but
laces
the
glass
nicely
a
bit
bubbly
at
first
surprising
given
the
flip
top
but
settles
down
to
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
dark
chocolate
toasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
burnt
coffee
with
a
downright
refreshing
fruitiness
to
tie
it
all
together
truly
a
great
black
beer
and
though
a
bit
pricey
worth
the
occasional
venture
to
the
expensive
import
aisle
ive
only
had
a
few
different
schwarzbiers
but
this
is
my
favorite
the
appearance
is
dark
with
a
nice
small
head
the
beer
looks
strong
but
it
has
a
smooth
taste
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
a
bottle
far
better
from
the
fliptop
bottle
ive
bought
this
several
times
without
dissapointment
this
whole
experience
was
slightly
better
than
average
it
poured
a
dark
red
colour
crystal
clear
with
a
huge
foamy
cap
that
left
thick
sticky
lacing
much
light
colour
than
i
was
expecting
smell
seemed
fairly
balanced
with
nice
sweet
malts
as
well
as
an
earthy
hoppy
smell
taste
was
heavier
on
the
malt
side
than
the
hop
side
and
had
what
seemed
to
me
a
bit
of
a
woodlike
taste
interesting
mouthfeel
was
nothing
special
smooth
drinkable
just
a
mark
or
two
above
average
not
bad
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
great

bottle
pours
black
in
color
with
mahogany
hues
when
held
up
to
the
light
aroma
is
clean
with
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
the
smell
is
really
nice
there
just
isnt
enough
of
it
as
it
is
too
faint
taste
is
delightfully
smooth
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
faint
taste
of
chocolate
the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
good
but
it
is
lacking
that
extra
punch
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
would
make
for
a
great
session
with
its
low
abv
this
beer
is
an
absolute
as
a
session
beer
it
has
everything
you
drink
porters
and
stouts
for
the
chocolatey
roasted
malt
flavors
without
a
lot
of
the
heaviness
that
said
beers
possess
it
doesnt
have
a
huge
mouthfeel
but
more
than
adequate
overall
i
found
this
to
be
the
best
of
all
worlds
and
will
visit
this
one
again
and
again
yet
another
reason
to
visit
germany
for
sampling
i
give
this
my
highest
recommendation
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
in
several
bay
area
locations
as
well
as
back
on
the
east
coast
its
a
good
schwarz
for
sure
its
no
death
and
taxes
but
than
what
is
nice
bottle
and
a
good
pour
a
dark
milky
chocolate
black
with
a
small
little
offwhite
coca
head
of
foam
that
leaves
some
decent
lace
aromas
are
all
chocolate
malts
and
a
bit
of
roast
with
some
nice
german
hoppage
going
on
as
well
taste
is
quite
good
as
well
roasty
with
some
definate
chocolate
hints
and
a
nice
bready
maltiness
that
is
full
of
depth
and
character
the
hops
balance
nicely
but
dont
have
an
in
your
face
profile
to
them
mouthfeel
is
creamy
a
and
a
bit
burntacrid
in
a
good
way
drinkability
is
also
very
good
an
a1
schwarz

sure

very
nice
and
clean

with
an
appetizing
lateblooming
dry

and
toasted

finish
mediumlight

with
good
balance
of
creaminess
and
carbonation
somewhat
understated
in
aroma
and
initial
flavor
but
develops
and
finishes
well
decent
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
pound
being
as
i
am
a
selfprofessed
intuitist
and
a
novice
cockswain
on
the
draught
boat
i
go
by
a
completely
different
set
of
beer
standards
than
some
dude
who
makes
love
to
a
row
of
barley
like
its
a
buxom
and
swanky
woman
im
in
it
to
become
more
ignorant
and
farcical
than
i
presently
am
plus
im
thirsty
and
heading
for
diabetes
amputation
adult
diapers
and
musty
white
pubes
so
i
might
as
well
get
some
olfactory
bliss
and
whatever
the
hell
the
pansophists
euphemism
for
sense
of
taste
is
while
im
able
this
stuff
is
akin
to
samuel
adams
black
lager
but
with
some
thousand
dollar
black
licorice
stuffed
into
its
pretty
mouth
i
could
see
me
waltzing
with
this
beer
and
settling
down
in
denmark
to
raise
my
fourteen
illigitimate
cyclops
sons
all
named
adolph
with
her
again
with
this
humanizing
to
and
fro
my
arm
lifting
the
swingtop
and
spinning
the
little
lusty
tramp
around
and
around
my
mouth
like
a
mouthful
of
liquid
gold
and
black
jelly
bird
eggs
happy
birthday
little
ones
all
the
rings
of
saturn
and
a
milky
way
of
stars
for
this
special
one
the
drinkability
for
this
beer
is
awesome
the
bottle
even
boasts
supremely
drinkable
roasted
malts
is
the
big
flavor
i
pick
up
the
beer
is
very
balanced
which
is
a
major
factor
in
its
drinkability
i
would
definatley
get
this
again
and
if
you
are
in
the
market
for
a
schwarzbier
this
one
will
not
fail
to
impress
salud
monchshof

with
ruby
highlights
from
a
brown
16
9
ounce
swingtop
bottle
the
aroma
is
primarily
roasted
malt
taste
is
quite
interesting
lots
of
roasted
malt
but
also
some
metallic
flavors
and
more
hops
than
i
expect
by
looking
at
it
quite
a
bit
lighter
than
a
porter
or
stout
but
with
some
of
the
same
roasted
malt
qualities
definitely
one
to
try
appears
light
black
to
dark
brown
in
color
translucent
when
held
to
light
and
a
fairly
nice
off
white
head
in
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
i
did
notice
one
flaw
and
that
was
a
rusty
charecter
i
almost
reminded
me
of
wellwater
ive
gotta
blame
the
beer
since
my
water
has
never
smelled
that
way
and
ive
never
noticed
it
in
another
beer
perhaps
it
was
oxidized
other
than
that
i
have
to
say
the
beer
was
a
bit
on
the
week
side
not
a
strong
smell
not
many
specialty
malt
flavors
or
perceptable
hop
flavors
and
a
bit
of
that
baking
sodacarbonation
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
though
i
gotta
say
im
a
bit
dissapointed
especialy
since
a
buddy
recomended
this
beer
to
me
and
even
got
him
hooked
on
the
style
i
gotta
hope
i
got
a
bad
bottle
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
low
abv
overall
id
purchase
again
this
seems
like
a
great
grilling
beer
for
a
hot
summer
night
not
the
most
complex
but
dangerous
easy
to
consume
d
excellent
warming
effects
in
the
nose
hearty
malt
taste
which
is
good
and
a
sound
mouthfeel
all
make
this
very
enjoyable
completely
drinkable
presented

a
tall
mönchshof
mug
a
34
tan
head
over
the
clear
dark
brown
brew
with
heavy
sticky

aroma
is
minimal
of
dark

taste
is
dark
malts
upfront
with
moderate
bitterness
coming
in
the
middle
and
setting
up
shop
with
both
carrying
through
to
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
both
very
good
this
would
be
big
time
sessionable
weird
color
on
this
beer
initially
this
poured
dark
black
just
like
a
stout
with
the
same
thin
head
then
as
it
settled
it
turned
a
dark
amber
brown
while
still
retaining
the
pitch
black
color
toward
the
top
of
the
glass
smelled
of
baked
raisin
bread
and
stewed
candied
yams
taste
reminded
me
of
a
thin
not
too
sweet
sweet
style
stout
but
with
a
thinner
mouthfeel
very
narrow
range
but
if
you
like
sweet
raisin
tinged
malts
like
i
do
this
is
a
nice
drinker
drinkability
is
good
but
would
not
be
my
choice
if
i
was
wanting
a
schwarz
to
quench
my
thirst
altogether
mönchshof
schwarz
is
a
highly
drinkable
schwarzbier
it
has
been
referred
to
as
a
black
pils
and
that
is
a
pretty
accurate
assessment
it
is
a
unique
beer
to
be
certain
and
different
than
any
other
schwarzbier
i
have
tried
it
is
easy
to
see
why
it
has
been
deemed
a
world
classic
and
given
four
stars
by
michael
jackson
it
simply
is
that
good
best
thingcool
bottle
dthis
beer
does
not
disappoint
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
very
easy
to
drink
the
bottle
label
calls
this
beer
a
black
pils
that
is
a
decent
description
one
of
the
easiest
beers
to
drink
that
i
have
run
across
goes
down
very
easy
another
500ml
would
be
very
welcome
but
final
note
self
it
is
a
fairly
expensive
import
i
would
go
for
the
nb
1554
before
this

its
more
economical
and
i
think
better
tasting
and
bodied
drinkability
excellent
i
like
anything
dark
in
a
beer
and
this
could
turn
into
my
regular
beer
of
the
day
to
drink
when
i
want
to
forget
the
pain
just
kidding
but
definetly
beckons
the
drinker
to
consume
more
this
was
a
great
beer
that
was
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
can
find
it
buy
it
you
will
not
be
disapointed
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
magic
brews
that
simply
disappears
from
the
glass
leaving
only
a
lingering
smile
genius
beer
easily
abused
and
nowhere
near
the
same
experience
when
it
is
please
buy
from
a
reputable
retailer
feels
like
a
light
beer
in
your
mouth
and
goes
down
farel
well
the
taste
thankfully
does
not
seem
to
be
suffering
from
oxidation
lightly
sweet
only
a
hint
of
smoke
and
even
a
smaller
hint
of
roastiness
a
small
berry
flavor
finishes
it
off
not
one
of
the
hoppier
schwarzbiers
ive
tried
but
its
good
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
buttery
mouth
feel
the
beer
is
meduim

very
drinkable
beer
overall
fliptop

clear

with
a
fine
frothy

that

has
a

aroma
with
powdered
cocoa
and
subtle
noble

notes
nose
opens

dry

slightly
coffeelike
richly
flavored
smooth
mouthfeel
but
fairly
thin
turns
slightly
grassy
towards
the
finish
which
is
quick
and
clean
leaves
a
nice
roasty
aftertaste
flavors
harmonize
well
and
are
difficult
to
differentiate
which
is
something
i
like
about

id
happily

several
of
these

much
better
if
serving
in
a

glass
recommendable
smell
like
a
characteristic
german
beer
made
by
expert
brewers
this
beer
poured
almost
like
a
dry
stout
but
without
the
nitro
bolstered
head
the
taste
is
initially
of
a
very
light
porter
and
with
a
clean
aftertaste
that
becomes
a
fruit
sensation
on
the
palate
the
hopmalt
balance
is
the
real
achievement
here
and
it
really
contributes
to
the
supreme
drinkability
its
just
right
in
other
words
the
mixture
of
great
roasted
malt
characteristics
of
a
porter
with
the
clean
zesty
taste
of
a
lager
with
an
absolutely
astounding
hops
balance
the
smell
upon
opening
the
bottle
is
not
an
effective
contrival
of
the
taste
that
this
beer
is
hiding
as
it
only
gives
you
an
idea
of
the
rooted
flavor
that
is
to
be
unleashed
the
supreme
balance
and
sublime
flavor
great
bier
recommend
im
drunk
this
is
an
incredible
offering
from
kulmbacher
brauerei
and
in
my
humble
opinion
a
must
try
soft
and
subtle
yet
flavorful
and
deep
perfect
what
craftsmanship
held
up
to
the
light
this
is
far
from
clear
but
gives
off
a
dark
crimson
fuzzy
glow
without
shining
through
interesting
not
much
head
thin
ring
is
all
buttery
nut
aroma
beery
mild
flavor
is
a
subdued
mix
of
caramel
and
chocolate
no
off
flavors
no
extreme
bitterness
no
sourness
this
is
probably
the
smoothest
and
most
drinkable
dark
beer
i
have
ever
encountered
burnt
sugar
flavor
without
being
sweet
nutty
without
extreme
bitterness
slight
hint
of
wheat
or
something
fresh
and
crisp
in
this
beer
slightly
botanical
and
this
gives
the
beer
a
basic
edge
and
counterpoint
to
the
silkiness
hard
to
describe
but
very
likeable
without
stepping
outside
of
the
box
perfect
session
german
will
try
this
again
would
probably
be
something
stellar
on
tap
pours
a

a
twofinger
offwhite
head
with
nice
lacing
and
retention
nose
is
grainyoatymaltysweet
with
a
hoppy
bite
taste
reminds
me
of
a
subtler
morebalanced
version
of
the
baltika
6
porter
which
i
enjoyed
much
more
hop
presence
in
this
one
but
the
highlyroasted
malt
character
reigns
supreme
especially
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
refreshing
crisp
but
not
watery
like
guinness
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
solid
sessionable
refreshing
dark
beer
doesnt
wow
you
but
solid
as
a
rock
all
around
very
drinkable
as
it
warms
and
mellows
and
softens
a
very
interesting
if
not
world
clasic
schwarz
beer
from
the
brewers
of
the
monks
courtyard
in
the
north
of
bavaria
the
brew
is
very
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
almost
like
a
lager
or
pilsner
that
forgot
what
color
it
should
be
surprisingly
light
but
unique
worth
a
taste
though
i
dont
know
that
id
buy
another
the
beer
pours
a
deep
mahagonyred
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
nice
quarter
inch
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
toasty
malt
with
a
light
caramel
sweetness
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
flavor
is
a
bit
better
some
nice
burnt
notes
with
a
bast
of
nutty
roastyness
not
too
shabby
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
drinkable
beer
i
like
the
flavor
it
could
be
a
bit
darker
for
a
schwarz
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
medium
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
weak
hints
of
caramel
the
flavor
has
some
dark
maltiness
but
seems
to
have
some
tannins
as
well
making
it
slightly
harsh
little
sweetness
the
body
is
much
more
thin
than
i
expected
the
drinkability
is
good
mouthfeel
is
also
very
nice
crisp
and
light
not
to
carbonated
i
could
easily
drink
many
of
these
beers
over
the
course
of
a
night
overall
very
good
and
certainly
something
that
id
enjoy
again
im
expanding
my
lager
horizons
the
label
on
the
monchshof
schwarz
proclaimed
it
to
be
a
world
classic
the
beer
didnt
disappoint
the
body
was
a
translucent
deep
brown
accented
by
bronze
the
head
acted
as
a
billowing
cumulous
cloud
the
taste
was
sublime
i
believe
the
label
was
right
world
classic
or
damn
near
it
the
flavor
features
a
nifty
little
tug
of
war
between
the
caramel
and
mocha
flavors
the
finish
is
crisp
and
bitterness
is
at
a
very
respectable
level
this
is
a
hell
of
a
session
beer
nothing
becomes
dominant
everything
is
in
perfect
balance
and
there
is
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
even
after
a
couple
a
classic
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
this
is
by
no
means
a
one
and
done
brew
but
one
a
person
could
savor
all
night
theres
plenty
here
to
keep
your
interest
well
into
the
evening
yet
nothing
that
stands
out
so
as
to
begin
to
wear
on
the
drinker
truly
outstanding
deep
auburn
with
an
offwhite
frothy
head
that
held
if
uneven
a
very
slight
bit
foggy
which
wasnt
expected
a
very
oatbread
sort
of
smell
to
it
with
some
citrus
at
the
end
of
each
whiff
not
too
sweet
with
good
hoppiness
on
the
finish
almost
dry
but
not
quite
not
really
memorable
though
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
alright
drinkability
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
as
well
not
too
much
carbonation
but
definitely
well
balanced
definitely
something
i
dont
get
to
try
too
often
and
i
like
it
spicy
bitterness
up
front
that
gives
way
to
roasted
malt
slightly
nutty
caramelly
sweetness
increases
into
the
cookieish
finish
lingering
vegetal
hop
notes
nice
mediumbodied
with
a
remarkably
soft
creamy
feel
a
great
beer
and
by
far
the
best
schwarzbier
ive
had
sugary
chocolatevanilla
and
whiffs
of
nutty
dry
bread
mingle
with
a
mild
herbal
hoppiness
for
an
open
invitation
to
take
the
first
sip
surprisingly
milky
in
texture
the
body
remains
light
woody
chocolate
malts
provide
a
very
robust
sweet
malt
flavor
thats
bordering
at
times
on
having
the
essence
of
dried
cherries
in
the
background
and
thats
balanced
perfectly
by
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
for
all
its
interesting
malt
flavors
this
remains
a
refreshing
beverage
with
a
clean
finish
absolutely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
on
the
planet
this
schwarzbier
poured
a
clear
deep
garnet
color
with
creamy
light
brown
sudsy
foam
that
settled
slowly
but
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
malty
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
chocolate
but
overall
a
rather
modest
aroma
the
taste
was
malty
caramel
cocoa
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
up
front
there
was
a
good
balance
of
tangy
hops
in
the
background
behind
the
malt
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
came
through
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
malty
with
medium
body
and
modest
carbonation
the
malty
flavors
lingered
briefly
this
was
an
easy
to
quaff
schwarzbier
not
bad
at
all
really
like
this
beer
im
not
really
well
versed
in
the
germans
category
and
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
this
style
so
this
was
a
great
change
for
me
appears
a
dark
brown
almost
black
coffee
color
and
murky
with
a
bit
of
creamy
head
on
top
smells
of
pale
malts
dust
and
mustyness
the
dusty
mustyness
definately
comes
through
in
the
taste
and
blends
perfectly
with
the
nutty
malts
and
creamy
milky
flavors
really
a
pretty
complex
beer
if
you
ask
me
excellent
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
semidry
finish
i
got
this
beer
at
the
moan
and
dove
on
a
whim
and
since
then
ive
been
getting
it
again
and
again
great
session
beer
great
overall
beering
experience
the
color
is
a
healthy
dark
dark
brown
however
head
is
short
and
lacking
the
aroma
is
of
dark
bready
malts
a
tiny
hint
of
chocolate
is
also
in
the
mix
taste
is
very
rich
for
a
lager
dark
toasted
or
lightly
roasted
malts
preside
a
slight
chocolate
taste
is
noted
towards
the
middle
which
leads
to
a
lingering
sweet
finish
throughout
there
is
also
a
pilslike
crispness
there
is
a
good
complexity
here
i
like
this
beer
its
heavy
for
a
lager
so
i
dont
think
id
session
it
as
much
as
most
other
german
styles
on
a
pairing
note
didnt
pair
quite
so
well
with
sausage
and
black
beans
as
was
suggested
to
me
just
made
the
beer
slightly
less
bitter
and
the
food
slightly
less
spicy
but
it
went
surprisingly
well
with
my
poundcake
for
dessert
the
flavors
in
both
blended
and
evened
out
nicely
who
would
have
thought
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
towering
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
black
malt
scent
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
element
it
has
a
roasted
barley
aroma
that
blends
nicely
with
the
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
and
rich
toated
caramel
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
smokiness
it
is
sweet
but
the
lager
yeast
leaves
a
dry
earthy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
goodadequate
carbonation
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
has
awesome
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
drinker
mönchshof
came
in
a
cool
fliptop
bottle
and
poured
a
dark
brown
color
very
reminiscent
of
a
cola
half
inch
head
of
tan
foam
capped
this
schwarzbier
the
nose
is
mostly
roasted
malts
tastes
surprisingly
light
for
a
beer
of
this
color
definitely
a
lager
a
good
brew
and
very
drinkable
at
just
under
5
this
brew
is
a
dark
brown
cola
color
with
a
medium
thick
beige
head
and
fair
lacing
smoky
aroma
with
some
roasted
coffee
and
caramel
mediumbodied
and
earthy
with
flavors
of
hops
toasted
malt
and
smoke
the
finish
is
carbonated
and
mildly
bitter
all
in
all
a
decent
schwarz
notes
very
nice
crisp
drinkability
of
a
pils
but
softer
and
a
touch
richer
i
love
darker
pilsners
but
this
thing
is
almost
black
it
has
a
nice
head
that
is
creamy
and
thick
the
aroma
of
dark
malts
is
well
blended
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
sugaryit
reminds
me
of
newcastle
for
some
reason
and
the
roasted
malty
goodness
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
hops
a
perfect
beer
in
my
opinion
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
i
dont
think
ill
ever
drink
a
better
dark
dry
lager
while
monchshof
schwarzbier
fails
to
bowl
me
over
it
does
impress
with
quiet
competence
in
fact
it
would
be
the
perfect
beer
to
show
drinkers
of
michelob
amber
bock
st
pauli
girl
dark
heineken
dark
etc
the
error
of
their
ways
a
very
dark
brown
but
not
black
beer
with
anice
tan
head
there
is
a
strong
aroma
of
sweet
carmel
malt
with
a
hint
of
molasses
the
flavor
starts
out
with
the
molasses
sweetness
and
gradeully
gives
way
to
a
nice
roasted
malt
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
seemed
a
little
watery
for
a
dark
beer
cool
flip
top
bottle
poured
a
nice
blackish
brown
with
a
medium
tan
head
very
creamy
bubbles
smells
malty
with
a
smoked
coffee
flavor
something
like
bittersweet
chocolate
dry
like
a
merlot
sweet
with
a
slightly
bitter
after
taste
good
carbonation
mouth
feel
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
bottle
says
its
a
pils
really
maybe
i
need
to
look
at
pils
beer
again
good
beer
to
start
octoberfest
with
deep
and
glowing
rubybrown
in
appearance
poured
with
a
large
and
creamy
head
of
tan
foam
the
aroma
is
very
interesting

touted
on
the
label
as
the
black
pils
and
this
beer
seems
to
fit
the
description
nice
fresh
grainy
aroma
of
a
pils
combines
with
buttery
pistachio
nuts
from
like
a
quality
brown
ale
the
taste
is
rich
with
roasted
and
woody
malts
with
a
slight
and
mild
smokiness
a
toasted
and
pleasantly
roasted
bitterness
is
soft
on
the
palate
and
smooth
in
the
throat
light
and
roasted
malt
body
a
very
interesting
beer
that
comes
across
as
an
hybrid
to
me
but
instead
of
being
strange
tasting
this
pulls
it
off
wonderfully
halfliter
swing
top
enclosure
pours
a
clear
reddishcopper
color
with
a
thick
beige
head
toasted
munich
malt
aroma
and
some
earthy
treebark
and
mossylike
smells
that
interplayed
with
subdued
hops
clean
smelling
smooth
dark
malts
without
dark
malt
stereotypes
no
coffee
no
chocolate
just
toasty
munich
malt
goodness
with
a
touch
of
astringency
pair
it
up
with
a
slightly
minerally
water
background
and
a
faintbutpresent
hop
finish
and
youve
got
yourself
one
fine
example
of
an
underscored
style
of
beer
very
drinkable
carbonation
is
average
the
black
pilseners
of
germany
are
really
good
this
one
from
kulmbacher
states
that
its
the
original
black
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
no
sediment
at
teh
bottom
of
the
glass
you
could
see
that
it
was
crystal
clear
just
very
dark
it
developed
a
nice
brown
head
that
remained
a
lace
throughout
its
aroma
was
of
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
straight
forward
simply
smokey
malt
the
hops
were
so
well
blended
in
that
it
had
a
simple
dry
finish
with
no
bitterness
the
feel
was
light
and
effervescent
although
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
body
the
taste
and
complete
package
is
very
pleasing
i
will
definately
have
to
have
more
of
this
fine
beer
500ml
swing
top
bottle
pours
a
black
with
ruby
red
notes
nice
frothy
head
taste
is
smooth
and
lucious
not
as
roasty
and
caramel
like
as
other
swartzbiers
one
of
the
better
black
biers
i
have
tasted
very
easy
drinking
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
it
please
dont
drink
it
too
cold
even
though
itsa
lager
i
had
it
well
chilled
but
the
flavours
came
out
about
10
min
out
of
the
fridge
and
bottle
the
drinkabliity
is
high
because
of
the
smooth
silky
taste
it
would
be
a
perfect
beer
in
the
fall
with
some
smoked
pork
or
bruder
basil
cheese
the
black
pils
was
certainly
an
apt
name
for
this
one
more
hoppy
than
the
other
schwarzbiers
that
ive
had
but
yet
had
the
roastiness
a
solid
beer
and
one
im
likely
to
enjoy
again
otherwise
in
my
opinion
there
are
more
definite
pils
to
be
enjoyed
the
flavor
was
of
strong
roasted
malt
yet
not
overpowering
and
not
burnt
like
some
can
taste
it
was
however
still
crisp
and
dry
with
very
good
well
balanced
hoppiness
as
the
bottle
proclaimed
it
was
a
wonderful
pils
its
not
black
dark
brown
with
some
garnet
highlights
i
got
a
big
lasting
tannish
head
very
clear
i
could
see
through
my
glass
very
nice
roasted
malt
aroma
with
maybe
a
tough
of
hops
darn
fine
tasting
beer
roasty
sweet
with
a
bitterness
that
i
would
expect
to
get
from
some
black
patent
dry
aftertaste
lingers
for
a
bit
medium
to
full
bodied
nice
drinking
beer
great
buy
on
my
part
quite
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
a
solid
well
rounded
schwarzbier
beer
pours
dark
brown
with

a
style
worth
looking
into
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
would
send
many
macroswillers
off
running
away
and
screaming
its
full
rich
malty
and
chewy
wellrounded
and
multidimensional
its
not
so
busy
that
it
confuses
and
while
it
has
nice
depth
the
body
certainly
does
not
stop
it
from
being
quite
drinkable
it
may
be
short
of
spectacular
but
its
well
into

territory

a

was

rather
strange
beer
i
liked
it
but
found
the
rather
strong
aftertaste
a
little
offputting
this
was
my

schwarzbier

i
wonder
how
this
one
compares
to
others
in
its
class
medium
feel
and
dry

pace
with
flavors
and
body
on
another
note
ill
be
keeping
this
bottle
with
the
swing
top
stopper
for
the
reason
that
it
has
three
labels
on
it
must
of
got
stuck
in
the
labeling
machine
or
something
so
that
makes
it
unique
and
collectable
in
my
book
my
first
beer
of
this
style
i
always
associated
pilsners
with
the
medium
yellow
ice
cold
brews
of
my
younger
days
this
brew
changed
that
first
the
appearance
was
a
dark
amber
with
a
substantial
head
that
dissolved
into
some
of
the
best
lacing
i
have
seen
aroma
was
light
and
malty
but
inviting
taste
was
light
to
medium
and
as
it
warmed
became
more
pronounced
mouthfeel
also
became
a
bit
oily
but
not
in
an
unpleasant
way
very
easy
to
drink
could
definitely
have
two

its

this

poured
a

overall
a

a

for
all
to

it
poured
a

that
quickly
diminished
this
beer
had
good

and
i
observed
some

and
the

was

the

was
a

was

somewhat

it
was
very

went
well
with

youre
in

also
a

eat
with

which
leads
to
it
being

the
flavor
of
this

was
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
was
expecting
more
and
i
didnt
get
it
the
flavor
reminded
me
more
of
a
golden

rather
than
the
dark
color
would
lead
you
to
believe
i
would
drink
it

some

roasty

a
thin
bitter
short
finish
with
slight
sourness
not
really
impressive
with
a
mediumsized
stable
creamy
head
this
beer
has
a
dark
nearly
black
color
the
taste
is
a
robust
coffeelike
bitterness
sometimes
like
cooking

little

or
character
i
am
biased
as
this
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
beer
served
to
remind
me
why
i
loved
the
presentation
of
both
the
bottle
and
in
the
glass
it
poured
a
dark
ambernear
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
there
was
a
very
malty
aroma
and
the
carbonation
filled
the
mouth
the
malty
aroma
carried
through
into
the
taste
which
gave
way
to
roasty
undertones
it
did
not
have
as
roasty
of
a
flavor
as
sprecher
more
on
par
with
kostritzer
136
outstanding
smooth
rounded
maltyness
slight
drak
roasted
flavor
great
beer
that
is
very
esay
to
drink
a
touch
too
sweet
for
what
i
consider
the
perfect
schwarzbier
but
damn
good
notes
a
rich
dark
lager
that
holds
a
great
smoothness
and
drinkability
roasted
flavours
are
perched
perfectly
on
the
taste
buds
and
add
a
light
complexity
to
the
palate
intense
deep
brown
color
with
nice
head
low
carbonation
makes
for
intense
creamy
malt
flavors
good
nutiness
and
dry
features
hops
are
barely
evident
some
huskiness
very
good
dark
lager
longerlasting
flavor
than
many
could
use
a
tad
more
complexity
and
a
touch
thin
late
in
the
profile
its
a
big
brewery
in
germany
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
here
dark
dark
dark
crimson
smell
is
roasted
malts
taste
is
very
smoky
dry
slight
bitterness
has
a
little
cigarette
ash
taste
to
it
overall
this
has
all
the
elements
some
of
which
are
emphasized
just
right
but
the
way
it
all
adds
up
leaves
me
wanting
something
to
be
a
little
different
i
did
it
side
by
side
with
the
bauhaus
schwarz
which
doesnt
have
as
much
smokiness
and
has
more
mellow
chocolate
which
i
preferred
a
bit
in
the
right
mood
this
is
a
solid
choice
and
i
dont
turn
it
down
overall
its
very
good
thanks
daftpatrick
for
the
opportunity
overall

this
beer
is
a
double
edged
sword
great
for
easydrinking
beer
nights
and
great
for
rich
and
flavorful
beer
nights
it
drinks
like
a
lager
but
tastes
like
a
hand
crafted
ale
i
highly
recommend
schells
chimney
sweep
cheers
overall
good
dark
beer
with
a
good
bitterness
but
not
overly
strong
in
comparison
to
other
styles
chimney
sweep
mucks
about
on
the
nose
for
sure
too
soft
and
not
smokey
at
all
the
palate
finally
introduces
the
smokiness
and
roasted
qualities
with
a
pleasant
splash
of
sweetness
again
the
flavors
could
be
more
bold
but
try
to
drink
this
and
not
enjoy
it
overall
pretty
decent
beer
but
was
hoping
for
more
smoke
i
think
this
beer
is
misclassified
it
should
be
a
smoked
beer
to
me
theres
nothing
subtle
about
the
smokiness
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
modest
light
tan
head
that
soon
settled
to
a
large
island
ring
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
mahogany
with
some
tiny
bubble
trails
aroma
is
smoke
dominated
and
then
malt
and
a
bit
of
spice
flavors
like
nose
plus
has
some
tart
fairly
dry
body
is
slightly
thin
carbonation
ok
finish
is
like
flavor
some
change
to
medicinal
gradual
taper
not
really
for
me
wish
it
had
been
a
traditional
schwarzbier
o
overall
this
is
a
great
seasonal
brew
for
the
cold
weather
months
not
the
typical
spiced
strong
seasonal
but
very
flavorful
and
robust
to
stand
up
to
the
winter
air
chimney
sweep
is
a
good
medium
bodied
black
lager
and
a
beer
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
its
considered
a
seasonal
brew
but
it
is
bottled
and
sold
over
both
the
fall
and
winter
so
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
seek
it
out
and
give
it
sample
give
it
a
shot
you
wont
be
disappointed
surprisingly
good
i
had
a
few
schells
beers
that
really
werent
that
good
o
great
beer
schells
puts
out
some
topnotch
stuff
and
this
may
be
my
favorite
of
theirs
they
stay
true
to
the
style
but
still
find
a
way
to
expand
and
leave
their
personal
mark
o
nice
schwartzbeer
i
have
always
liked
this
style
and
this
is
a
pleasant
american
version
would
definitely
drink
again
id
be
in
no
hurry
to
probably
ever
buy
this
again
but
oh
well
softly
roasty
aroma
sweet
fruity
plum
carob
or
cocoa
dry
taste
less
sweet
than
the
aroma
lets
on
though
there
is
a
slight
amount
dry
cocoa
light
unsweetened
chocolate
dried
dark
fruit
light
and
drinkable
though
not
without
substantial
flavor
drinks
like
a
nice
porter
more
than
a
schwarzbier
and
thats
a
good
thing
its
near
black
with
some
nut
brown
hues
below
a
fine
creamy
toasted
sheet
smells
nice
and
roasty
with
soil
char
toast
some
prunes
and
cocoa
flavor
follows
suit
with
some
nice
roasted
malts
dry
soil
some
hints
of
cocoa
and
leather
a
really
nice
beer
nice
light
body
with
a
crispy
carbonation
and
a
wet
finish
surprisingly
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
dark
brown
amber
soapy
khaki
head
smell
is
light
and
grainy
taste
starts
light
and
grainy
with
a
smooth
roasted
malt
kick
at
the
finish
vanilla
cocoa
beans
and
charred
wood
the
body
is
mediumlight
in
weight
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
surprisingly
full
foamy
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
closes
semidry
with
a
bit
of
astringency
from
the
dark
malts
and
hops
used
overall
this
is
pretty
good
its
a
pretty
good
schwarzbier
but
the
addition
of
the
smoke
makes
me
really
enjoy
it
great
beer
easy
to
drink
i
love
the
smoke
o
its
a
good
black
lager
nice
balance
not
to
smokey
for
my
taste
would
go
great
with
a
burger
or
brat
its
warm
smokey
clean
and
dry
the
mouth
could
be
a
little
more
for
me
and
the
flavor
isnt
so
bold
but
its
another
solid
well
crafted
beer
from
schells
mmmm
mmm
good
beer
and
you
can
drink
it
o
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
schells
is
good
at
making
incredible
lager
beers
that
drink
like
ales
if
youve
never
tried
schells
this
is
an
great
place
to
start
not
a
fan
of
liquid
smoke
a
rare
schells
miss
for
me
not
a
good
beer
enjoying
how
this
beer
packs
a
dense
load
of
flavors
without
being
a
huge
highly
alcoholic
imperial
a
great
beer
in
a
style
lacking
for
great
widely
available
options
in
the
u
s
this
is
up
there
with
black
bavarian
overall
its
not
that
great
but
an
above
average
take
on
the
style
worth
picking
up
for
a
cheap
schwarbier
this
warms
nicely
too
the
caramel
flavors
start
to
show
through
without
any
excess
sweetness
seems
to
hold
some
ale
qualities
but
clearly
a
lager
and
an
enjoyable
one
too
final
thoughts
if
its
offered
as
part
of
a
variety
sixpack
or
you
can
find
one
bottle
it
would
be
worth
the
purchase
however
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
evening
if
you
like
smoked
beers
and
lagers
then
this
would
be
one
to
tick
for
you
would
i
drink
it
again
doubtful
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
overall
this
was
pretty
good
the
flavor
is
nice
and
balanced
and
its
easy
to
drink
the
scent
lead
me
off
at
first
but
the
end
result
was
a
pleasant
surprise
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
light
brown
head
some
roasted
malts
in
the
aroma
otherwise
its
just
a
slight
smoked
scent
the
flavor
is
quite
bold
with
deep
rich
malt
flavors
lots
of
bread
tones
with
a
hint
of
smoke
in
the
flavor
finishes
with
a
chalky
after
taste
pretty
decent
winter
brew
that
if
full
of
flavor
and
yet
is
easy
to
drink
o
fairly
solid
decent
drinkability
im
a
little
bummed
this
replaced
schells
stout
though
looking
forward
to
see
what
they
replace
this
with
once
spring
roles
around
since
this
is
their
extended
winter
seasonal
o
this
is
a
very
nice
schwarzbier
another
good
beer
from
august
schell
in
a
style
that
most
overlook
overall
im
yet
again
impressed
by
another
new
offering
from
schells
definitely
recommended
a
great
winter
drinker
here
othis
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
enjoyed
it
the
first
time
i
had
it
and
am
enjoying
it
again
as
i
review
relatively
unique
in
the
u
s
beer
landscape
these
days
oother
than
the
smokiness
which
is
rather
subdued
this
is
kinda
a
disappointment
from
schells
i
had
there
schwarzbier
a
few
years
ago
at
a
pub
and
remember
it
being
a
bit
better
than
this
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
hues
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
roasted
malt
toast
smoke
and
hints
of
milk
chocolate
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
aroma
of
this
beer
and
the
taste
is
no
exception
to
that
there
are
lots
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
notes
with
a
subtle
yet
apparent
smokiness
that
permeates
the
palate
tying
everything
together
like
the
aroma
there
are
some
nice
backing
notes
of
toast
and
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
chewy
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
really
well
done
beer
in
a
style
munich
dunkelschwarzbier
that
i
enjoy
immensely
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
over
the
course
of
a
tough
winter
and
wet
spring
overall
a
really
good
version
of
a
dark
germain
style
lager
good
dark
roasty
taste
while
still
keeping
it
fairly
light
and
balanced
overall
this
is
a
tasty
schwarzbier
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
sprecher
to
compare
it
to
nice
balanced
flavor
with
sweetness
and
roasted
notes
not
as
much
smokiness
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
it
does
show
up
creamy
easy
to
drink
a
good
one
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
a
slight
roasted
malt
and
smoke
aftertaste
a
nice
subtle
beer
which
accommodates
food
nicely
this
would
be
great
with
pizza
august
schells
chimney
sweep
pours
a
deep
colacolored
brew
under
a
cap
of
loose
tan
foam
the
nose
is
dark
malt
and
a
bare
hint
of
smoke
applewood
maybe
up
front
is
a
good
dark
roastybready
flavor
and
that
note
of
smoke
off
the
back
mildly
bitter
herbal
hops
for
balance
it
has
a
medium
body
to
my
taste
off
dry
and
very
drinkable
ill
miss
schells
stout
which
chimney
sweep
is
replacing
i
imagine
it
was
a
bit
out
of
august
schells
institutional
contort
zone
though
their
chimney
sweep
is
german
all
the
way
overall
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
this
but
figured
i
would
give
it
a
chance
i
was
initially
curious
about
it
and
the
description
on
the
packaging
sold
me
on
the
purchase
smoked
beers
are
generally
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
this
one
i
genuinely
enjoyed
it
is
easily
my
new
favorite
winter
seasonal
a
very
well
done
offering
by
schells
if
anyone
is
on
the
fence
when
coming
across
this
one
i
definitely
recommend
a
try
prost
picked
up
a
bottle
at
four
firkins
and
paired
it
with
a
piece
of
thanksgiving
pecan
pie
the
aroma
has
a
clean
mix
of
caramel
and
cocoa
malts
with
a
mild
roasted
edge
the
flavor
mixes
in
a
touch
of
smoke
to
the
dry
chocolate
and
toffee
to
make
a
tasty
black
lager
thats
not
too
thick
but
by
no
means
simple
give
it
a
try
overall
fantastic
schwarzbier
with
some
rauchbier
thrown
in
for
shits
and
giggles
this
is
the
fifth
new
beer
i
have
had
from
schells
this
year
and
it
is
the
best
a
very
dark
lightly
smoked
lager
bier
from
new
ulm
mn
mild
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
smoke
aromas
milk
chocolate
honey
and
bacon
flavours
um
yeah
sweet
smokey
bacon
goodness
not
raw
and
in
your
face
very
subtle
delicious
finish
is
balanced
slightly
sweet
vague
smokey
astringency
did
i
say
delicious
is
this
what
they
drink
in
franconia
lucky
deutchelanders
a
combination
of
a
schwarzbier
and
a
rauchbier
not
as
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
as
other
schwarzbiers
because
of
the
smoke
and
roast
but
this
is
unique
and
should
definately
pique
the
interest
of
smokey
beer
lovers
a
really
nice
beer
here
that
drinks
wonderfully
i
could
easily
consume
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
was
personally
hoping
for
more
of
the
smoke
to
come
through
but
thats
just
me
a
wonderful
addition
the
the
winter
lineup
for
schells
taste
is
great
and
well
worth
it
12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
medium
lasting
beige
head
aroma
and
taste
is
mild
dark
roasted
caramel
malt
yeast
notes
grains
mild

bitterness
palate
is
a
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
finshes
with
dark
caramel
malt
mild
roasted
malt
and
grains
and
mild
hops
overall
an
ok
drinking
brew
overall
a
tasty
ale
average
overall
this
might
fit
the
style
profile
but
unless
i
was
at
mcsorleys
in
nyc
throwing
back
a
few
then
i
doubt
that
id
seek
this
out
again
extra
points
for
being
easy
to
drink
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
an
excellent
schwarzbier
at
the
least
i
would
totally
seek
this
out
and
recommend
it
to
the
beginning
craft
beer
drinker
as
a
good
transition
beer
as
well
as
an
alternative
to
a
stout
in
which
they
may
not
like
it
is
a
great
alternative
to
the
latter
in
the
winter
as
you
feel
like
you
can
session
this
5
5
abv
beer
without
getting
bloated
and
hammered
4
out
of
5
gotta
love
the
chops
on
ol
mcsorleys
jowls
yo
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
cocoa
powder
and
a
kiss
of
roasted
malts
both
thoroughly
intertwined
as
much
as
they
can
be
given
the
mass
discrepancy
and
fairly
faint
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
strong
contingent
of
cola
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
schwarz
though
its
irishness
doesnt
really
come
through
whatever
that
would
mean
anyway
texture
was
a
bit
off
but
overall
pretty
solid
for
the
style
nothing
fancy
but
a
solid
session
beer
overall
quite
nice
and
easy
to
drink
with
some
decent
roast
and
malt
flavors
not
bad
overall
this
a
decent
mild
and
mellow
brew
that
id
love
to
try
out
on
tappreferably
at
mcsorleys
old
ale
house
got
this
one
trade
a
black
lager
dark
like
cold
coffee
in
a
glass
without
ice
black
hole
like
nose
is
ripe
fruits
and
raison
and
caramel
and
floral
ok
taste
is
light
malt
and
prune
and
then
some
bitter
overall
quick
and
somewhat
watery
not
chewy
or
overly
rustic
seems
much
like
the
other
black
lager
ive
tried
i
guess
overall
however
im
lukew
on
the
style
this
is
the
best
american
dark
lager
available
it
has
incredible
roasted
malt
flavor
and
drinks
smooth
like
a
dark
lager
should
sure
i
would
prefer
kostritzer
on
tap
but
in
the
us
this
is
not
a
real
possibility
i
actually
prefer
this
beer
to
the
original
kostritzer
in
the
can
or
bottle
and
i
can
afford
it
as
a
retired
beer
lover
at
a
price
point
lower
than
most
american
adjunct
lagers
this
flavorful
brew
is
affordable
and
readily
available
kudos
to
pabst
for
making
it
available
and
affordable
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
crisp
and
easy
drinking
overall
it
was
a
pleasant
take
on
the
style
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
regularly
poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
edges
and
over
a
finger
of
beige
head
the
head
dissipated
very
quickly
and
left
very
little
lacing
behind
the
nose
was
bready
with
a
trace
of
roast
there
is
also
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
in
the
flavor
profile
but
the
taste
and
body
of
this
beer
are
pretty
thin
there
are
both
light
sweet
and
bitter
notes
on
the
finish
o
very
nice
schwarzbier
ive
enjoyed
this
on
tap
at
my
local
watering
hole
for
many
years
around
st
pattys
day
it
almost
looks
as
if
i
have
cocacola
in
my
mug
rather
than
beer
with
its
similar
almost
translucent
deep
brown
color
and
thin
fizzy
head
the
aroma
is
like
that
of
a
sweet
stout
giving
my
nose
the
pleasure
of
milk
chocolate
roasty
malts
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
hops
as
well
the
light
bodied
beer
coats
my
mouth
nicely
with
its
oily
mouthfeel
and
as
the
beer
traverses
my
palate
i
begin
to
again
notice
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
stout
flavorings
and
this
time
in
the
taste
itself
there
is
a
definite
pronounced
hop
bitterness
especially
in
the
finish
this
is
an
excellent
everyday
beer
very
straightforward
and
mild
i
am
particularly
fond
of
schwartzbier
although
this
is
no
kostritzer
ultimately
you
really
need
to
take
a
trip
to
mcsorleys
old
ale
house
in
nyc
get
a
table
and
knock
back
a
bunch
of
these
with
some
rowdy
friends
this
beer
is
decent
but
not
great
i
probably
wont
try
it
again

mcsorleys
may
have
an
irish
name
but
its
a
germanstyle
beer
brewed
by
an
american
company
too
weak
for
stout
lovers
this
blackish
beer
may
be
a
good
introduction
for
those
too
timid
yet
for
the
dark
roastiness
of
authentic
irish
stouts
and
when
viewed
in
this
regard
its
not
too
bad
an
offering
at
all
id
happily
have
another
notes
this
is
good
this
is
very
good
beer
a
rather
good
black
lager
relatively
light
in
body
feel
but
with
a
nearly
full
luscious
dark
malt
roundness
flavorful
and
smooth
goes
to
show
that
decent
malty
dark
beers
can
be
made
with
lager
yeasts
too
served
a
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
fades
to
some
lacing
aroma
of
malt
with
a
trace
of
caramel
there
is
also
a
bit
of
coffee
and
nut
in
the
background
taste
of
malt
coffee
and
some
bittersweet
chocolate
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
throughout
and
a
dry
finish
medium
body
crisp
and
smooth
nice
balance
easy
drinker
nice
beer
for
the
style
i
think
having
this
on
tap
at
an
irish
pub
enhances
the
character
of
this
beer
conclusion
this
is
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
and
it
is
by
far
the
best
there
is
good
balance
and
complexity
in
the
feel
and
flavor
and
this
beer
hits
the
style
head
on
i
think
if
it
was
smoother
and
less
carbonated
cask
anybody
it
would
reach
new
heights
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
spectacular
in
flavor
or
aroma
glad
its
something
different
in
style
with
such
wide
availability
d
a
good
little
lager
though
extremely
straightforward
and
thin
even
for
the
style
itself
nice
simple
beer
very
drinkable
overall
a
simple
beer
that
goes
down
quite
well
would
make
a
great
session
beer
d
good
flavors
and
a
nice
balance
id
have
it
again
d
o
it
is
an
enjoyable
brew
my
sample
was
laser
stamped
on
the
neck
with
071311
i
assume
that
is
a
date
but
im
not
sure
if
it
is
a
bornon
date
or
a
drinkby
date
either
way
it
was
pretty
good
o
the
overwhelming
dry
dirtlike
component
to
this
beer
definitely
doesnt
do
it
any
favors
mcsorleys
irish
black
lager
is
not
something
id
be
interested
in
having
again
i
loved
the
fact
that
its
american
made
by
pabst
we
can
sure
use
the
jobs
its
a
real
dark
beer
not
at
all
like
millers
lowenbrau
dark
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
enjoyed
relaxing
with
it
yeah
my
sponsors
not
going
to
like
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
step
down
beer
but
it
further
proves
to
me
that
pabst
brews
beers
i
like
shh
over
all
a
surprisingly
good
beer
and
one
im
glad
a
snagged
in
a
make
your
own
sixer
there
is
a
bar
of
the
same
name
in
manhattan
that
serves
this
though
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
brewing
d
such
a
solid
beer
should
not
be
so
easy
to
drink
but
sure
enough
it
is
i
can
and
have
easily
made
an
evening
out
of
this
beer
well
balanced
delightful
stuff
beer
is
thin
to
medium
in
body
with
a
mild
tartness
on
the
finish
and
a
roasty
aftertaste
the
forward
of
the
beer
is
minimally
sweet
and
the
overall
beer
is
fine
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
and
i
would
outright
recommend
it
either
but
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
guinness
is
my
de
facto
standard
beer
for
irish
drinking
but
it
casts
its
shadows
on
other
up
and
coming
irish
brews
similar
in
their
dark
and
malty
flavor
delivered
on
a
light
palate
these
beers
sacrifice
tradition
and
history
for
flavor
and
innovation
mcsorleys
irish
black
lager
is
the
newest
beer
in
this
category
like
any
other
dark
lager
it
promises
some
of
that
dark
maltiness
in
a
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
easy
drinking
with
strong
alelike
flavors
the
smell
resembles
coke
with
touches
of
raisins
the
biggest
difference
between
this
and
any
kind
of
dark
ale
is
the
notable
absence
of
fig
aromas
that
textured
sweet
smell
is
gone
leaving
a
dark
yet
simpler
aroma
clear
and
clean
through
the
nostrils
and
inspiring
clear
headedness
this
straightforward
cleanliness
paired
with
flavor
is
duplicated
in
the
taste
where
a
nice
dark
roasted
malty
sweetness
hovers
along
the
palate
offset
by
a
kind
of
alkaline
baseness
complexity
is
shunted
to
the
side
in
this
easy
drinking
beer
itself
a
fine
rival
for
my
attention
against
guinness
guinness
however
continues
to
be
my
favorite
beer
for
recipes
that
call
for
something
dark
and
sudsy
to
enrich
a
dish
overall
i
liked
this
easy
to
drink
not
overdone
or
overcarbonated
id
have
this
again
smooth
full
mouthfeel
goes
down
smoothly
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
coming
from
the
pabst
company
goes
to
show
you
shouldnt
judge
a
beer
before
you
taste
it
overall
a
solid
black
lager
a
good
thirst
quincher
with
full
flavor
overall
this
is
a
good
black
lager
but
i
wanted
more
bite
and
wildness
to
it
i
found
it
slightly
too
watery
and
thought
the
flavors
could
have
been
better
emphasized
and
drawn
out
o
good
drinking
beer
wont
blow
you
away
d
another
cheapish
alternative
to
the
popular
and
easy
to
find
guinness
pleasant
and
quite
drinkable
but
not
so
remarkable
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
the
head
was
ok
but
nothing
rave
about
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
roasted
and
had
some
hops
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
some
decent
roasted
flavors
going
on
that
finish
with
a
decent
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
overall
its
a
very
light
beer
for
such
a
dark
color
its
probably
worth
checking
out
overall
a
good
dark
lager
that
is
what
you
expect
from
the
style
a
lighter
brew
with
some
darker
flavors
o
pretty
good
drinking
beer
i
could
drink
this
one
again
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
found
it
interesting
it
has
many
of
the
characteristics
that
i
would
normally
associate
with
a
baltic
porter
or
a
dry
stout
without
being
as
rich
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
dark
but
dont
want
to
crack
open
one
of
your
bigger
beers
when
you
have
the
name
irish
on
your
beer
there
are
expectations
when
you
also
stick
the
word
black
on
the
label
the
expectations
increase
this
beer
poured
a
dark
dark
brown
and
even
looked
plain
brown
for
the
last
third
a
nice
tan
head
with
a
scent
that
said
welcome
old
friend
smelled
just
like
a
beer
should
i
need
mcsorleys
to
make
a
candle
of
this
beer
taste
was
rich
not
overbearing
i
could
make
a
night
with
a
few
of
these
very
very
smooth
brew
is
very
drinkable
for
sure
not
a
ton
of
flavors
but
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
pretty
good
stuff
d
easy
to
drink
for
sure
lacks
character
to
be
a
regular
beer
though
okay
objectivity
didnt
work
out
so
well
miedium
roasted
malt
flavor
with
the
astringent
hops
from
america
and
a
an
effervescant
yeast
gives
a
little
dry
palate
the
finish
is
a
little
musty
but
still
very
drinkable
this
is
a
perfect
local
pub
session
irish
lager
overall
a
nice
beer
for
the
price
it
was
pretty
drinkable
i
thought
this
wasnt
too
bad
it
had
a
roasted
coffee
like
aroma
slightly
robust
the
taste
was
similar
but
it
was
a
little
thin
again
it
had
a
roasted
nature
it
was
like
mixing
a
light
stout
with
a
well
carbonated
lager
overall
i
thought
it
tasted
a
tad
generic
it
wasnt
bad
and
for
the
most
part
i
was
happy
with
my
6pck
purchase
i
bought
it
on
sale
on
sat
12
when
every
store
was
having
an
irish
beer
special
so
it
was
worth
the
price
on
that
day
but
i
wouldnt
go
flocking
back
unless
it
was
on
sale
notice
a
high
score
for
appearance
and
nothing
else
they
got
the
color
of
the
style
right
but
thats
about
it
no
yeast
funk
like
there
should
be
the
malts
lake
depth
the
hops
are
forgettable
even
though
this
isnt
supposed
to
be
a
hoppy
style
anyway
tastes
like
an
adjunct
version
of
a
schwarzbier
which
i
suppose
is
what
it
is
was
cheap
anyway
avoid
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
mcsorleys
brew
didnt
expect
much
as
theyre
part
of
pabst
but
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
for
about
a
buck
a
bottle
its
a
good
value
the
cpj
mcsorleys
irish
black
lager
is
a
very
dim
brown
beer
with
a
thin
sald
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
film
and
leaves
decent
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
lot
of
roasted
coffee
and
a
touch
of
greenness
its
mediumlight
bodied
a
little
watery
pretty
smooth
and
the
finish
is
chalky
its
pretty
lightly
flavored
its
roasty
and
tastes
a
lot
like
dark
malt
extract
theres
no
bitterness
really
its
not
sweet
or
dry
roast
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
its
nothing
standout
its
a
pretty
bland
session
beer
with
no
glaring
faults
very
drinkable
at
the
price
and
at
5
5
i
wont
be
slamming
these
down
but
id
be
happy
to
have
this
with
a
meal
d
a
decent
drinking
beer
but
nothing
that
will
blow
your
socks
off
simple
and
light
a
good
entry
beer
here
i
think
drinks
very
easily
and
has
good
flavor
even
though
it
wont
punch
you
in
the
face
d
i
dont
know
what
the
abv
on
this
beer
is
but
the
only
downfall
i
see
in
drinkability
is
its
dryness
other
than
that
it
is
a
tasty
smooth
and
very
drinkable
lager
a
solid
beer
nothing
too
fancy
just
good
light
thin
coffee
finish
easy
to
kick
back
a
bunch
just
wish
they
cranked
the
flavor
up
a
notch
or
too
it
would
still
make
it
a
session
beer
but
a
more
enjoyable
one
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
deep
and
dark
aroma
it
was
certainly
unexpected
to
have
such
roasty
malts
but
it
was
considerably
more
surprising
to
find
robust
chocolate
and
nice
buttery
character
the
taste
followed
through
for
the
most
part
lacking
only
in
the
same
assertiveness
found
in
the
nose
there
is
nothing
that
is
blatantly
wrong
with
this
beer
but
there
is
nothing
that
makes
me
want
to
buy
it
if
i
have
the
choice
between
other
beers
its
not
bad
by
any
means
and
for
some
it
may
be
a
good
choice
however
it
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
i
really
loved
this
beer
i
had
never
heard
of
it
before
and
found
it
on
tap
at
one
of
the
local
bier
stubes
it
was
a
very
dark
beer
similar
to
a
stout
smell
and
taste
of
coffeechocolate
the
great
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
lack
of
aftertaste
most
beers
like
this
have
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
that
wasnt
the
case
here
i
will
definitely
have
this
beer
again
this
arrived
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
half
inch
of
slightly
tan
head
foam
quickly
melted
to
a
thin
cap
thin
lace
lines
left
behind
smell
had
some
roasted
malt
a
bit
nutty
and
bready
a
solid
euro
dark
taste
some
coffee
notes
with
nice
malt
character
touch
of
bitterness
to
finish
body
was
a
bit
thin
but
appropriate
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
too
memorable
beautiful
blackred
color
and
a
nice
thick
head
with
a
light
brown
color
not
too
impressed
with
the
smell
simply
a
bold
malty
scent
impressive
roast
flavor
at
first
and
then
finishes
with
a
mild
chocolatecoffee
flavor
and
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
very
impressive
considering
its
dark
reputation
i
have
had
this
on
tap
and
in
bottle
form
and
will
definitely
drink
it
again
d
this
is
drinkable
but
could
be
much
better
drinkability
i
note
that
this
beer
is
now
brewed
in
latrobe
and
i
wonder
a
bit
whether
the
recipe
has
changed
certainly
i
was
more
impressed
than
i
expected
to
be
reading
the
reviews
of
others
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
dark
color
nearly
black
with
red
hues
the
aroma
is
layered
with
lots
of
chocolate
malts
theres
little
hop
aroma
at
all
just
lots
of
specialty
grains
backed
by
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
similar
its
a
dry
beer
very
clean
with
a
lot
of
heavily
roasted
malt
balanced
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
touch
oily
and
slick
easy
to
drink
and
worth
a
try
this
beer
pours
pitch
black
it
has
a
slightly
spicy
aroma
i
dont
believe
it
is
brewed
with
rye
but
it
has
an
aroma
of
a
bit
of
rye
and
a
hint
of
smoke
it
tastes
of
dark
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
coffee
a
hint
of
smoke
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
back
end
it
is
flavorful
yet
not
heavy
d
very
good
i
love
this
stuff
for
happy
hour
in
the
afternoon
that
inbetweeness
makes
it
very
attractive
for
a
stout
drinker
like
me
not
too
heavy
if
the
weather
isnt
right
or
youre
just
not
in
the
mood
but
not
water
thin
either
rightly
nice
in
the
middle
very
very
pleasing
find
drinkability
4
5
out
of
5
the
upside
of
the
thinness
is
that
mcsorleys
is
very
easy
to
drink
its
the
versatile
kind
of
beer
you
could
enjoy
on
your
own
or
take
to
a
noncollege
party
d
because
of
the
low
abv
and
the
smootheness
of
the
exprience
overall
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
d
very
drinkable
and
a
contender
in
this
class
on
tap
it
was
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
tan
headsmell
is
sweet
malts
and
toffee
with
some
hops
taste
is
good
with
hops
and
toasted
malts
a
touch
of
nutmeg
some
light
coffee
mouth
feel
is
on
the
light
side
with
all
the
flavors
not
bursting
out
at
you
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
though
try
this
one
great
drinkable
and
a
good
overall
beer
even
better
from
the
overall
an
average
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
i
wouldnt
dink
much
of
this
i
drink
it
until
i
cant
drink
anymore
when
im
at
mcsorleys
but
with
the
bottled
variety
i
am
good
after
one
or
two
great
dark
beer
quite
a
find
in
a
middle
of
nowhere
il
bar
in
the
middle
of
summer
otherwise
overall
nice
but
not
a
really
interesting
beer
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
forget
a
nice
every
day
drinking
beer
this
was
an
interesting
experience
being
my
first
time
with
this
style
of
beer
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
and
even
afterwards
i
still
wasnt
sure
what
i
got
it
wasnt
as
simple
as
was
described
to
me
as
just
being
a
brew
with
the
taste
and
smell
of
lager
that
just
happened
to
be
black
naw
doesnt
work
like
that
but
mcsorleys
did
manage
to
throw
all
of
my
senses
together
in
an
array
of
confusion
the
color
was
indeed
black
with
little
to
no
head
or
lace
the
smell
came
up
and
grabbed
my
nostrils
with
a
clean
and
crisp
simple
oatlike
malt
with
a
very
plain
and
simple
hop
note
the
taste
echoed
the
smell
with
very
little
residual
i
was
on
the
fence
with
how
i
liked
the
feel
of
it
telling
myself
that
maybe
the
black
color
of
the
brew
was
biasing
my
opinion
of
what
the
feel
should
be
like
but
it
was
that
of
a
medium
body
with
a
few
harsh
bubbles
here
and
there
draining
down
the
sides
of
the
palate
the
refreshment
hits
in
the
middleback
of
the
tongue
id
like
to
try
mcsorleys
again
i
think
it
has
potential
probably
need
more
time
and
concentration
to
really
get
a
feel
for
it
situation

overall
rather
flat
and
nondescript
overall
appeal
a
bit
of
a
warmer
for
february
and
march
but
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
this
can
be
a
nice
afterdinner
glass
mouthfeel
is
kinda
weak
due
the
watery
nature
of
the
beer
but
id
definitely
have
another
which
is
good
because
i
bought
a
6pack
aroma
is
smoky
with
a
yeasty
overtone
not
strong
but
ok
it
pours
a
semitransparent
coke
brown
with
a
fluffy
and
thick
if
not
persistent
pale
tan
head
flavor
is
a
bit
weak
but
malty
and
smoky
with
hints
of
spice
and
molasses
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
just
a
bit
watery
if
they
can
thicken
this
beer
it
will
be
a
winner
i
picked
this
up
at
hannafords
for
7
99
a
six
pack
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
noticed
a
thick
puffy
head
a
foam
very
dark
in
color
but
light
in
texture
similar
color
to
a
draft
stout
but
with
the
consistency
of
a
lager
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
and
very
drinkable
it
is
listed
as
5
5
alcohol
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
it
is
that
strong
a
good
beer
to
mix
in
every
now
and
then
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
small
tight
tan
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
very
light
roasted
malt
mineralmetal
scent
burnt
grains
and
some
chocolatepeat
all
are
quite
subtle
the
taste
is
of
light
roasted
malt
grainy
and
the
beginnings
of
a
chocolate
or
coffee
flavor
not
too
bad
a
bit
grainy
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
more
of
the
roasted
flavor
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
very
burpy
fairly
sweet
all
around
like
a
macro
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
one
that
could
change
some
dark
beer
haters
could
use
some
more
flavor
but
it
is
servicable
id
have
to
say
a
was
surprised
at
how
good
this
little
beer
was
i
might
come
back
again
for
this
one
this
beer
can
give
the
generally
wellregarded
sam
adams
black
lager
a
run
for
its
money
black
with
caramel
highlights
and
a
moderate
tan
head
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
with
a
clean
slightly
dry
body
for
a
brewery
that
produces
a
variety
of
labeled
products
lion
nailed
the
style
on
this
one
d
ive
had
this
on
tap
an
mcsorleys
in
ny
and
really
enjoyed
it
but
it
wasnt
as
good
from
the
bottle
a
little
bland
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
probably
only
have
again
at
mcsorelys
overall
i
was
impressed
d
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
so
is
quite
sessionable
its
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
are
looking
to
drink
a
lot
of
something
that
has
some
flavor
granted
i
did
drink
this
a
little
warmer
than
i
should
have
but
being
ice
cold
just
covers
up
all
the
flaws
so
now
they
are
all
brought
out
notes
this
isnt
anything
special
but
it
isnt
really
supposed
to
be
a
roasty
beer
it
is
just
a
euro
lager
that
is
colored
with
some
malt
flavor
however
that
doesnt
mean
it
is
a
bad
beer
i
like
it
for
a
session
beer
because
it
is
more
flavorful
while
still
light
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
when
i
saw
the
style
my
expectations
dropped
but
it
was
pretty
good
with
some
intricate
flavors
d
a
decent
beer
you
could
stand
to
have
few
of
if
you
have
nothing
better
you
could
session
with
it
not
much
in
the
way
of
drinkability
skip
this
and
you
will
not
have
missed
a
thing
d
this
is
a
good
average
drinking
beer
nothing
over
the
top
but
gives
enough
flavor
that
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
plus
the
story
ba
lukafer
has
about
the
actual
bar
is
amazing
dont
trust
me
bm
him
and
ask
you
can
drink
it
but
im
not
sure
you
can
enjoy
it
middle
of
the
road
and
there
are
better
examples
out
there
taste
is
slightly
better
than
the
aroma
still
has
the
base
of
caramel
malts
and
toasted
grains
but
it
is
off
set
by
a
faint
hop
bitterness
nothing
crazy
at
all
but
teh
slight
bitterness
makes
it
enjoyable
enough
and
makes
you
enjoy
the
subtlety
of
the
malts
more
than
i
could
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
and
it
maintains
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
throughout
not
a
great
lager
but
definitely
enjoyable
i
would
say
this
falls
closer
to
a
schwarzbier
with
the
more
pronounced
roasted
note
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
its
another
underwhelming
lager
in
the
vast
world
of
lager
beer
overall
a
solid
brew
for
my
first
taste
of
lion
brewery
definitely
worth
a
try
its
an
easy
drinker
for
being
so
dark
mcsorleys
black
lager
is
pretty
average
for
dark
lagers
a
caramel
malty
base
is
met
with
heavy
toast
and
even
roasted
grains
no
fruitiness
and
the
beer
shies
away
from
coffee
or
char
still
dark
brown
much
darker
than
it
tastes
a
little
softer
on
the
palate
but
still
not
a
schwarzbier
either
heavy
carbonation
and
minerally
flavors
make
the
beer
taste
and
feel
a
bit
abbrasive
the
beer
needs
a
maltier
base
and
more
creamy
texture
before
fading
into
dryness
and
lightness
its
an
ok
beer
that
has
a
hard
time
competing
with
german
dunkels
but
has
too
much
roast
to
even
compare
dvery
smooth
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
this
beer
is
very
soom
and
creamy
almost
guiness
nitro
creamy
which
makes
it
easy
to
go
down
and
rounds
out
the
beer
great
d
this
beer
has
more
to
it
than
i
expected
its
quite
good
and
easy
to
drink
as
well
a
good
session
brew
drinkability
a
simple
drinkable
brew
not
bad
not
great
it
gets
the
job
done
medium
bodied
fairly
smooth
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
i
was
expecting
something
different
from
this
beer
not
that
thats
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
its
flavors
are
rich
and
overall
its
decent
but
its
wouldnt
be
the
first
dark
lager
id
pick
up
skål
so
this
is
what
they
are
drinking
at
a
small
joint
in
ny
maybe
someday
ill
see
it
but
until
then
this
is
a
good
sturdy
bottle
of
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
highly
recommended
my
inner
drunk
likes
this
beer
high
drinkability
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
kinda
leaves
a
dry
mouth
behind
but
that
encourages
more
drinking
if
you
wanna
get
solidly
drunk
at
6
99
a
6
pack
louisiana
pick
this
up
d
pretty
decent
drinker
actually
and
sort
of
an
interesting
concept
it
does
have
some
quirks
but
is
really
quite
well
put
together
still
you
do
get
the
feeling
that
the
name
preceded
the
brew
those
rascally
marketing
guys
d
a
lot
like
mixture
of
killians
and
guinness
draught
darker
and
perhaps
a
bit
more
flavor
than
either
not
something
id
buy
again
but
ive
certainly
had
worse
ordered
a
bottle
at
the
lansdowne
pub
near
fenway
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
faded
fast
smelled
a
bit
like
cola
syrup
tasted
was
interesting
reminded
me
of
a
combination
of
pumpernickel
bread
and
black
licorice
very
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
weird
fizz
and
an
acrid
aftertaste
like
burnt
coffee
i
can
see
how
some
might
enjoy
a
big
mug
of
this
but
i
dont
think
it
was
good
enough
to
encourage
me
to
order
another
d
not
recmoned
for
a
six
pack
try
one
and
see
how
ya
like
it
different
tastes
for
different
poeple
but
not
for
me
cheers
d
a
generic
dark
lager
drinks
like
one
drink
it
and
forget
it
d
a
dark
or
dunkel
lager
fan
might
session
this
as
the
abv
seems
modest
and
flavors
are
alright
if
you
can
have
it
for
a
good
price
and
theres
really
not
much
available
id
condone
picking
it
up
although
if
there
were
something
available
in
the
way
of
a
true
schwartzbier
id
easily
leave
this
one
behind
rjt
drinkability
is
decent
for
a
brown
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
it
is
a
bit
weak
in
the
end
could
be
better
drinkability
fairly
high
drinkability
but
again
nothing
too
special
the
mouth
was
slightly
thick
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
could
be
a
session
beer
for
some
pours
a
threefinger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
just
about
black
with
no
highlights
medium
bodied

medium
carbonation

from

spirits
acton
ma
did
get
this
at
a
festival
and
drink
it
from
the
bottle
honestly
i
think
this
might
taste
better
that
way
it
was
cheap
and
its
okay
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
another
one
at
a
beer
store
or
restaurant
even
though
it
was
relatively
cheap
definitely
a
dark
lager
in
terms
of
taste
body
and
crispness
note
of
black
patent
malt
and
mildly
burnt
toast
thin
body
and
relatively
high
carbonation
light
hop
in
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
a
combination
of
two
bittershop
and
dark
roast
malts
i
bought
this
for
a
friends
party
he
grew
up
in
manhattan
and
i
knew
it
would
have
sentimental
value
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
euro
dark
lagers
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
it
was
ok
but
no
great
shakes
impressive
dark
color
good
tan
head
aroma
is
almost
non
existent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
ok
and
this
beer
would
be
good
for
almost
any
season
overall
this
beer
didnt
seem
terribly
clean
and
while
not
terrible
its
not
worth
seeking
out
i
found
it
enjoyable
and
drinkable
relaxing
but
not
refreshing
i
could
see
it
going
good
with
a
meal
and
a
cigar
i
was
happy
with
the
beer
and
ill
most
likely
purchase
again
in
the
future
d
a
good
beer
i
have
not
had
many
of
these
black
lagers
but
i
could
see
myself
getting
a
case
of
this
pours
a
dark
black
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
toward
the
light

flavor
hits
me
with
a
wicked
lactic
sour
note
that
i
wasnt
expecting
still
has
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
coffee
but
theres
this
wild
ripe
fruit
note
with
the
souring
effect
i
didnt
care
for
in
a
black
lager
but
it
honestly
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
stegmaier
porter
in
a
weird
way
i
think
they
mixed
this
recipe
with
the
penn
dark
recipe
because
this
looks
moore
like
the
penn
dark
of
old
than
the
newly
bottled
stuff
from
the
lion
does
really
solid
dark
lager
when
said
and
done
and
after
the
slightly
sour
twang
goes
away
it
gets
better
with
each
sip

creamy
with
sturdy

drinkability

a
decent
beer
coming
from

not

i

notes
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
black
lager
not
bad
stuff
d
enjoyable
for
a
few
fairly
smooth
going
down
with
a
fullness
that
can
be
appreciated
without
weighing
you
down
d
very
drinkable
i
liked
it
good
lager
flavor
is
nice
not
fantastic
or
fullbodied
but
enough
character
with
the
roastiness
peaty
malt
and
potent
tanginess
to
keep
me
interested
for
the
drink
not
too
bitter
but
definitely
dry
rather
than
sweet
and
malty
tart
hops
carbonation
was
a
little
high
for
me
and
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
persuasive
overall
pretty
good
and
very
drinkable
for
the
flavors
it
packs
though
i
could
do
without
the
hoaky
mcsorleys
ale
house
history
and
other
gimmickry
suggested
by
the
label
come
on
its
a
contract
brew
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
i
think
this
is
an
exceptional
find
for
any
irish
stout
lover
the
overall
characteristics
are
very
similar
to
the
guinness
250
anniversary
edition
brew
this
has
the
same
sourness
that
guinness
is
synonymous
with
especially
the
foreign
or
extra
stout
strains
while
not
as
complex
as
guinness
foreign
stout
it
seems
very
similar
to
guinness
250
edition
it
has
slightly
more
mouthfeel
and
slightly
less
maltiness
due
to
it
being
a
black
lager
to
be
sure
if
you
find
it
cheaper
then
guinness
at
your
market
then
this
is
a
definite
buy
im
comparing
this
to
guinness
simply
because
it
seems
to
emulate
it
so
much
it
has
the
same
basic
acidity
and
maltiness
of
the
recent
250
variety
ie
it
has
more
flavor
then
the
guinness
draught
versions
but
its
not
as
heavy
as
the
foreign
stout
versions
the
main
thing
that
i
like
about
this
beer
over
other
irish
ales
is
it
seems
to
have
the
same
brettanomyces
strains
of
sourness
that
i
like
in
guinness
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
a
mcsorleys
and
from
what
ive
gleened
this
is
a
relatively
new
contract
from
lion
brewery
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
this
keeps
going
i
think
its
good
for
what
it
is
a
lighter
guinness
foriegn
stout
d
flavorful
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
beer
thats
ok
to
drink
for
a
while
if
you
want
a
darker
beer
that
isnt
too
heavy
but
its
not
something
that
i
would
choose
unless
the
selection
were
limited
not
sure
exactly
what
makes
this
irish
its
pretty
dark
though
i
see
bare
hints
of
red
through
my
weizen
glass
head
is
moderate
and
drops
quickly
to
a
thin
covering
sheet
nose
isnt
strong
coffee
and
some
tobacco
flavour
is
fairly
smooth
somewhat
acidic
a
little
bit
fruity
with
a
decent
hop
takes
a
while
but
burnt
and
coffee
flavours
appear
as
well
dry
with
a
moderate
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
carbonation
pretty
smooth
and
not
toasty
for
such
a
dark
beer
fwiw
though
easy
drinking
with
some
good
balanced
flavours
and
pretty
accessible
for
beginners
overall
its
a
fairly
drinkable
lager
with
a
nice
character
but
nothing
special
pretty
solid
atmosphere
nice
appearance
and
pleasant
although
simple
nose
flavor
is
much
the
same
not
complex
but
tasty
solid
feel
good
drinkability
solid
quaff
drinkability
wow
for
all
the
flavor
and
nice
mouthfeel
here
this
beers
damn
drinkable
no
abv
listed
but
i
cant
feel
it
halfway
through
so
im
guessing
its
in
the
45
range
also
this
beer
was
very
cheap
considering
i
want
to
pick
up
a
6
pack
in
the
future
what
a
unique
find
black
lagers
other
than
german
schwarzbiers
arent
too
common
this
beer
has
a
great
roasty
aroma
with
no
hop
in
the
nose
at
all
it
pours
a
deep
brownblack
color
it
is
very
light
on
the
tongue
and
very
clean
like
a
schwarzbier
it
isnt
the
most
impressive
beer
but
very
drinkable
indeed
mouthfeel
is
true
lager
upfront
with
a
nice
roasted
linger
to
make
you
wan
another
sip
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
a
refreshing
example
of
the
style
not
standout
but
good
and
worthy
of
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
crystal
and
chocolate
malt
scent
along
with
some
slightly
fruity
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
black
and
crystal
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
light
earthiness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carobnation
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
lager
i
like
a
little
more
crystal
malt
flavor
but
this
is
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
enjoyed
while
watching
the
australian
gp
last
sunday
blackbrown
in
the
glass
decent
short
lived
head
smoky
stoutlike
scent
in
the
nose
and
in
the
initial
taste
with
a
fairly
rich
dark
malt
flavor
though
somewhat
smoother
obviously
a
lager
than
a
stout
not
quite
as
much
of
the
rich
roasted
flavor
of
a
schwarzbier
but
very
much
like
a
quality
dunkel
a
bit
of
astringent
alcohol
flavor
emerges
as
the
beer
warms
reducing
the
drinkability
rating
a
bit
great
offering
however
and
thanks

for

their
is
no
website
where
this
product
is
listed
at
all
and
googling
irish
black
lager
turns
up
nothing
on
google
so
the
style
of
it
is
kind
of
a
mystery
could
be
a
swarzbier
pours
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thinnish
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
chocolates
and
sulfur
faint
earthy
hops
try
to
provide
balance
but
cant
muster
the
strength
to
battle
the
maltiness
of
this
brew
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
with
sugary
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
some
miner
off
flavors
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
crisp
mouthfeel
decent
beer
but
really
nothing
special
thanks
for
the
state
tick
but
not
a
great
beer
for
the
style
tastes
of
roasted
malt
burnt
grains
light
caramel
smoked
or
burnt
wood
yeast
light
hops
and
a
little
citrus
zest
that
leaves
a
slight
bitter
pucker
malty
smoky
flavor
overall
thats
decent
but
not
very
complex
heavy
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
light
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
beer
o
good
beer
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
it
and
would
definitely
like
another
hint
hint
like
to
give
other
beers
from
this
brewery
a
shot
its
a
decent
beer
but
no
head
turner
seems
it
was
more
enjoyable
from
the
tap
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
quite
sweet
but
not
in
a
cloying
way
it
is
almost
boozy
but
the
finish
is
excellent
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
a
sweeter
interpretation
of
the
schwartzbier
category
to
anyone
interested
in
dark
lagers
roasty
clean
with
just
a
touch
of
smoked
malt
pumpernickel
bread
grassy
earthy
ops
and
just
a
little
watery
coffee
good
session
schwarz
overall
not
bad
but
not
special
i
prefer
the
samuel
adams
black
lager
if
they
were
to
remove
the
lactose
sweetness
give
it
more
body
while
also
giving
it
more
of
a
bite
probably
would
choose
a
different
schwarzbier
if
one
was
available
this
is
kind
of
like
a
crisper
more
refreshing
brown
ale
by
that
i
mean
its
lightly
bitter
medium
bodied
and
really
drinkable
only
instead
of
going
for
nodes
of
nuts
and
biscuit
this
tries
to
be
like
a
really
easy
drinking
lagered
version
of
a
stout
in
that
respect
it
succeeds
pretty
well
enjoyed
at
the
abner
pub
in
norman
ok
in
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
thick
dark
brown
color
with
no
head
at
all
aroma
is
very
week
with
smoke
and
malt
characteristics
the
taste
is
very
smokey
and
malty
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffe
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
empty
an
watery
overall
worth
a
try
because
its
cheap
12
ounce
stubby
bottle
the
label
classifies
this
as
a
black
lager
and
the
pour
doesnt
disappoint
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
slight
head
that
is
more
foamy
than
it
is
creamy
head
retention
is
better
than
what
ive
seen
in
other
choc
beers
likewise
the
aroma
is
strong
with
some
notes
of
coffee
specifically
dark
and
earthy
like
coffee
grounds
some
chocolate
is
there
but
its
a
supporting
note
and
not
the
main
focus
the
first
taste
reveals
a
charbroiled
meat
caramelized
steak
like
afterfinish
one
thing
i
can
say
for
the
choc
beers
the
flavor
profiles
are
certainly
unique
further
exploration
of
the
taste
profile
yields
a
nice
chocolate
note
that
really
shines
at
the
end
of
the
taste
toasted
malt
is
present
throughout
my
only
complaint
is
that
id
like
this
beer
to
be
more
chewy
as
the
relatively
thin
body
sort
of
washes
away
under
the
complex
flavor
profile
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
a
little
heavy
handed
as
well
this
is
a
beer
that
i
think
could
benefit
from
a
bit
more
of
an
aggressive
streak
as
the
flavors
would
work
great
in
a
robust
baltic
porter
or
russian
imperial
stout
here
however
they
all
come
rushing
out
in
the
beginning
but
are
washed
away
much
too
quickly
from
notes
tasted
may
2010
this
beer
looked
great
coming
out
of
the
bottle
thick
foamy
head
and
rich
black
color
the
beer
was
definitely
lighter
in
body
almost
watery
and
not
refreshing
of
lifting
the
taste
was
pretty
flat
not
very
much
bitterness
i
was
expecting
more
aftertaste
but
not
much
to
be
had
lighter
body
with
too
much
carbonation
almost
a
prickly
feel
however
that
would
be
my
only
real
complaint
pretty
simple
and
clean
d
easy
drinker
goes
down
easy
good
for
a
couple
as
it
is
a
bit
filling
well
worth
a
try
never
expected
a
quality
brew
like
this
from
an
okie
brewery
d
great
drinkability
the
drink
lends
itself
to
being
a
good
after
dinner
beer
although
it
definitely
lends
itself
to
all
occasions
im
trying
to
think
what
this
lacks
compared
to
others
of
this
style
that
i
prefer
drinks
fine
reasonable
taste
lighter
body
good
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
this
one
disappeared
fast
this
is
a
smokytoasty
beer
its
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
are
pronounced
but
not
too
bold
goes
down
very
smooth
highly
sessionable
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
brew
dcarbonation
is
an
issue
here
but
overall
this
drinks
pretty
nicely
pretty
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
would
love
to
see
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
some
noble
hops
added
to
the
mix
to
tone
down
the
sweetness
a
little
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
black
lager
a
little
too
heavily
roasted
for
my
taste
to
have
more
than
a
couple
but
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
beer
worth
trying
thanks
to
chris
for
the
opp
the
body
wasnt
too
heavy
given
its
still
a
lager
it
was
quite
easy
to
drink
the
carbonation
was
sharp
and
left
a
nice
tingle
in
the
mouth
after
the
brew
was
a
memory
d
a
very
nice
mildly
sessionable
beer
would
go
great
with
certain
fooddessert
pairings
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
lagers
ive
had
mmm
the
beer
is
pretty
sessionable
drinks
easy
d
tastes
alright
but
i
wish
you
could
taste
some
of
the
sweet
in
the
malts
rather
than
all
burnt
bitter
d
i
did
not
care
for
this
at
all
was
very
hard
to
drink
for
me
however
i
know
a
few
people
who
love
this
type
of
beer
so
i
will
be
getting
it
for
them
just
becuase
i
did
not
enjoy
it
i
would
discuarge
d
i
kind
of
liked
this
black
lager
i
enjoyed
the
smokey
chocolate
taste
it
had
but
wish
i
could
have
tasted
the
sweet
malts
a
little
more
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
again
but
if
i
saw
it
i
might
give
it
another
try
overall
a
decent
offering
much
more
mild
in
character
than
expected
but
there
were
no
off
flavors
very
drinkable

heavy
with

caramel
with
a

of

drink
was
surprisingly
smooth
and
unlike
other
schwarzbiers
i
have
tried
the
roast
was
not
overpowering
but
well
proportioned
with
the
other
flavors
as
the
glass
warmed
a
little
this
smoky
flavor
faded
and
the
chocolate
malt
took
the
fore
a
very
very
refreshing
drink
after
my
meal
the
perfect
pick
me
up
on
a
snowy
day
d
this
is
generally
a
style
that
i
dont
care
for
much
bit
im
enjoying
this
one
its
got
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
worth
getting
sometime
to
try
very
tasty
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
back

back
this

went
down

buy
this
beer
for
sure
a
nice
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
begging
you
for
another
taste
d
nice
flavors
not
overpowering
not
a
lot
of
hop
bitterness
or
flavor
nothing
over
the

all
this
makes
the
beer
very
drinkable

is

medium

i
have
a
feeling
im
going
to
buck

overall
trend
in
the
ratings
i
was
pretty
impressed
by
this
lowish
abv
lager
flavorful
without
weighing
too
heavilyon
the
palate
i
wouldve
mistake
this
for
a
porter
if
i
didnt
know
better
d
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
flavorful
in
the
nose
and
mouth
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
botmc
i
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pitch
black
with
a
slight
white
head
the
nose
was
slight
perhaps
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
sweet
with
roasted
malt
the
finish
lingers
with
a
mild
bitterness
this
is
light
in
body
and
easy
drinking
even
though
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
enjoyed
this
d
definitely
an
easy

did

for

poured
a

without

nothing

not

maybe
a

which
i
wasnt
crazy
about
taste
was
o
k
it
was
clean
and
smooth
like
a
lager
feel
was
good
refreshing
i
need
to
try
other
beers
from
this
style
cheers
i
really
liked
this
one
nutty
toasty
malty
a
nice
swartz
bier
thats
easy
to
drink
not
really
worth
paying
a
premium
for
however
for
someone
afraid
of
getting
into
stouts
and
darker
beers
this
is
a
great
introductory
selection
like
a
black
pils
very
good
beer
was
suggested
by
local
regular
glad
i
had
one
tasty
quite
a
dark
lager
almost
gives
itself
stout
qualities
in
taste
but
its
lager
qualities
keep
it
sessionable
a
great
lager
and
would
probably
be
a
good
transition
beer
for
someone
wanting
to
get
into
stouts
as
well
not
bad
but
could
be
better
the
smell
was
a
bit
stale
looks
like
a
standard
black
lager
werent
very
winningly
hints
of
much
nice
mouthfeel
though
minimal
carbonation
but
still
enough
dark
but
no
very
much
so
for
a
schwarzbier
mild
head
and
carbonation
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
aroma
no
surprises
there
chocolate
coffee
flavor
thats
well
rounded
some
bitterness
hint
of
herbal
dark
brown
with
crimson
edges
very
sweet
aroma
with
caramel
nuts
and
persimmons
tastes
sweet
with
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
bitter
in
the
end
some
dark
fruitiness
exists
light
bodied
excellent
balance
on
this
tasty
classic
i
like
this
beer
i
acknowledge
that
it
is
light
for
the
style
but
i
personally
prefer
this
to
a
more
stylistically
accurate
version

ironically
the
taste
is
the
best
thing
this
littel
beer
has
going
for

the
appearance

at

to
get
anything
the
taste
was
straightforward
but
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
off
too
i
really
like
unitas
baba
which
is
a
4
abv
black
lager
and
it
does
a
lot
more
than
this
one
at
5
4
in
front
the
front
a
light
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
cocoa
and
coffee
some
bitterness
then
onto
a
lager
yeast
drying
in
the
back
end
cheers
cheers
not
a
bad
dark
session
lager
the
appearance
on
this
was
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
it
is
a
clear
dark
redish
brown
that
holding
it
up
to
the
light
looks
like
a
nice
strong
tea
the
halffinger
of
beige
head
disappeared
quickly
but
left
a
small
ring
around
the
glass
throughout
the
nose
has
nice
earthy
tones
of
straw
and
wood
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
chocolate
its
body
is
smooth
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
notice
yet
seems
exceedingly
thin
for
a
dark
beer
all
things
considered
id
have
this
again
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
shortlasting
offwhite
head
slight
lacing
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
roasted
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
earth
the
taste
is
similar
the
body
is
is
thinner
and
smooth
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
as
it
finishes
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
a
kostritzer
but
is
still
a
good
beer
the
bottle
and
label
are
beautiful
love
the
stunted
bottleshape
bonus
was
the
bottle
though
it
is
only
11
ounces
it
totally
fulfills
my
dare
to
be
different
desire
agreeable
taste
but
not
the
most
complex
or
satisfying
beer
in
the
world
it
may
be
unfair
to
judge
this
beer
with
an
eleventh
hour
expiration
date
and
crappy
storage
but
even
with
that
it
is
fairly
solid
as
a
mild
easy
drinking
dark
session
brew
i
also
liked
that
this
was
affordable
in
a
case
of
12
with
the
cute
bottles
and
fun
caps
rockpaperscissors
o
very
nice
black
lager
that
is
malt
dominated
yet
balanced
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
truly
sessionable
beer
with
a
light
easy
feel
that
had
almost
no
weight
in
the
stomach
and
slid
down
smoothly
great
part
about
it
is
the
flavor
as
it
is
quite
remarkable
for
what
it
is
chocolate
malt
forward
i
got
a
little
molasses
a
tinge
of
hops
and
some
fudge
brownie
tastes
a
lot
like
a
brown
ale
with
easy
lager
drinkability
nice
beer
but
lacks
any
kind
of
layering
of
the
malt
kind
of
one
dimensional
i
liak
it
overall
above
average
to
good
solid
beer
pretty
much
in
the
middle
worth
at
try
and
you
just
might
find
out
why
this
is
a
repeat
purchase
for
me
a
very
good
choice
if
you
want
to
kick
back
and
have
a
few
beers
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
just
wish
there
was
more
flavor
beyond
the
plum
sweetness
o
excellent
beer
glad
i
chose
it
with
a
great
pizza
overall
where
this
beer
shines
is
easy
to
drink
attributes
tasty
but
hardly
strongly
flavored
you
could
give
one
of
these
to
anyone
and
they
would
like
it
this
beer
is
a
deep
brownishred
colored
beer
it
has
a
darkens
but
underlying
clarity
the
beer
has
a
modest
head
off
white
and
soapy
the
smell
is
grainy
and
smokey
slightly
acrid
and
a
bit
malty
the
taste
is
slanted
sweet
but
overall
balanced
not
really
bitter
but
the
finish
is
abrupt
medium
in
body
and
solid
drinkable
and
aptly
named
mouth
more
heavy
bodied
than
your
typical
lager
which
compliments
the
sweet
side
of
this
brew
very
well
less
carbonated
than
your
typical
lager
overall
light
considering
the
formidable
malt
presence
another
reviewer
used
cold
coffee
as
a
way
to
describe
this
beer
and
while
it
is
nowhere
nearly
as
hearty
or
roasty
as
youd
imagine
that
to
be
there
is
definitely
a
light
and
bright
breakfast
coffee
character
going
on
low
part
of
roasted
malt
on
the
palate
with
anise
and
some
woody
herbal
qualities
in
the
hop
bitterness
the
bitterness
is
low
but
crisp
and
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
due
to
the
low
carbonation
and
full
body
sessionable
for
sure
the
easiest
drinking
dark
lager
around
d
a
nice
little
dark
lager
fair
amount
of
coffee
roast
and
licorice
flavors
packaged
up
in
a
nice
sessionable
format

not
really

it
pours
a
clear
deep
mahogany
with
thin
offwhite
head
and
little
to
no
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
faint
dark
chocolate
notes
dominate
the
palate
light
bodied
with
light
carbonation
overall
a
drinkable
beer
that
has
light
attributes
for
a
dark
beer
o
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
perfectly
drinkable
though
not
as
technical
and
well
rounded
as
the
better
schwarzbiertype
brews
out
there
rich
and
smooth
has
some
heft
without
being
debilitating
this
was
my
first
beer
of
the
fest
and
was
a
good
way
to
kick
the
entire
session
off
in
a
perfect
world
i
would
have
made
several
trips
to
the
full
sail
booth
and
imbibed
this
all
afternoon
long
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
think
the
excessive
burnt
roasted
malt
goes
just
a
tad
overboard
the
alcohol
was
good
in
this
and
had
i
bought
more
i
could
have
downed
a
few
more
in
one
sitting
even
though
its
muggy
as
anything
outside
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
thought
that
it
fit
the
description
of
what
a
good
schwarzbier
should
be
not
as
roasted
as
a
porter
full
as
a
stout
or
roasted
and
sticky
as
a
scotch
ale
this
has
a
nice
niche
of
its
own
and
is
one
of
the
few
dark
beers
that
could
be
enjoyed
yearround
certainly
worthy
of
the
session
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
poured
from
a
pill
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
thin
ring
of
film
on
the
surface
aromas
of
sweet
nut
and
hints
of
smoke
with
a
grainy
backbone
and
charcoal
notes
flavors
of
smoke
and
rich
robust
toffee
and
nut
very
balanced
but
light
thin
smooth
body
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
smokey
sweet
aftertaste
with
no
real
linger
very
easy
to
drink
tastes
just
like
the
old
school
dark
lagers
you
used
to
find
at
shakeys
and
the
other
pizza
joints
actually
its
a
lot
like
pabst
bock
from
the
70s
though
this
does
have
a
hint
of
hops
from
the
12
oz
stubby
bought
at
trader
joes
overall
a
nice
sessionable
yet
flavorful
schwarzbier
and
a
fairly
good
example
of
the
style
the
watery
quality
does
detract
from
the
beer
however
appears
a
beautiful
black
beer
with
ruby
cola
highlights
dark
tan
head
light
whimsical
lacing
left
behind
its
everything
i
want
in
a
beer
so
far
the
nose
is
earthy
hops
with
a
kiss
of
roasted
far
caramel
notes
the
flavor
is
just
as
expressive
with
dark
malts
and
pure
sexiness
than
any
other
dark
lager
on
the
market
these
brewers
nailed
the
essence
of
a
session
beer
light
bodied
on
the
palate
but
balanced
to
perfection
never
feeling
watered
down
this
is
beer
everyone
can
and
will
embrace
notes
its
good
to
see
this
style
there
are
not
too
many
of
them
and
this
one
is
very
drinkable
cheers
overall
its
not
going
to
make
the
front
page
of
the
nyt
for
setting
the
beer
world
ablaze
but
its
certainly
quite
drinkable
and
was
well
worth
the
price
a
tasty
beer
doesnt
have
to
set
records
or
blaze
new
territory
to
be
enjoyable
o
a
decent
roasty

small

i
have

in

of
course
its

and
drinkable
so
enjoy
smells
cold
and
crisp
taste
smooth
and
nice
a
easy
drinking
beer
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
beer
not
a
bad
sip
in
the
whole
glass
drink
and
enjoy
and
smile
when
you
do
it
o
a
simple
dark
lager
that
gets
the
job
done
but
not
in
an
interesting
or
flashy
manner
not
bad
just
simplistic
to
a
fault
a
nice
schwarzbier
worth
checking
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
though
it
might
lack
in
flavor
and
depth
it
is
a
good
beer
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
poured
from
a
brown
11
oz
bottle
yes
11
oz
has
a
cola
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
smokiness
taste
is
roasted
malts
smoke
a
bit
of
hops
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
fairly
well
done
schwarzbier
light
worth
a
single
purchase
but
i
would
still
reach
for
better
crafted
takes
on
the
style
with
the
same
abv
and
more
flavor
german
made
ones
to
be
more
specific
my
aggro
pour
created
a
cascading
action
that
eventually
settled
into
nearly
three
fingers
of
dense
deeptan
head
that
looked
like
the
top
of
a
root
beer
float
its
retention
was
such
that
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
to
check
for
color
and
clarity
only
to
be
flabbergasted
by
its
ruby
color
and
stunning
clarity
nose
smelled
of
dark
chocolate
and
freshly
dug
soil
earthy
as
all
getout
that
they
could
accomplish
this
in
a
lager
is
amazing
we
make
some
great
lagers
here
in
pa
thanks
to
our
german
heritage
but
this
is
great
for
a
west
coast
concern
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
and
i
was
getting
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
smoke
tobacco
and
earth
in
the
mouth
finish
was
semidry
and
very
tasty
with
the
smoky
chocolaty
flavor
really
lingering
i
might
try
this
out
on
my
work
colleague
spike
who
is
not
generally
a
fan
of
beer
i
almost
forgot
to
mention
the
lovely
sticky
lacing
that
remained
in
my
glass
it
may
require
a
jackhammer
to
remove
o
the
look
and
aroma
were
marginal
but
the
flavour
and
drinkability
tke
this
brew
home
a
nice
example
of
a
style
that
i
dont
see
very
often
alway
nice
to
find
a
dark
flavourful
brew
that
is
light
in
body
othis
beer
is
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
in
particular
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
match
for
the
flavors
it
is
a
touch
sweet
and
not
terribly
complex
and
if
i
were
really
a
stickler
for
judging
on
style
my
rating
would
drop
a
bit
but
for
being
a
month
past
due
i
find
it
reasonably
tasty
and
drinkable
can
only
be
consumed
in
pairs
as
the
cap
has
rock
paper
or
scissors
printed
underneath
knowing
full
sail
this
does
what
they
meant
it
to
do
not
approaching
a
german
schwarz
for
depth
or
roastiness
but
so
drinkable

this

that

the

at
first
sip
overall
a
decent
schwarzbier
but
a
little
underwhelming
i
prefer
the
original
pils
o
very
impressed
the
body
of
a
lager
with
the
taste
and
aroma
of
something
more
easy
drinking
sessionable
and
very
good
roasted
but
carbonated
bubbly
crisp
and
some
metallic
twang
to
teh
flavor
and
palate
some
earthy
hop
flavors
helping
to
balance
the
metal
flavors
sort
of
easy
to
drink
but
too
metallic
for
my
taste
overall
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
unfortunately
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
something
i
would
pick
up
again
its
just
a
tad
too
boring
i
can
see
how
this
would
be
a
session
beer
however
especially
given
the
abv
not
bad
but
not
particularly
substantial
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
rather
onedimensional
just
mild
caramel
malt
and
little
else
i
guess
id
like
to
see
a
more
robust
malt
character
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
roastinessbitterness
to
complete
the
flavour
still
it
goes
down
easily
this
would
be
a
good
choice

you
dont

i
dont

to
bash
the

i
could
see
it
being
a

more
in

balance
then
it
is
now
overall
inoffensive
easy
drinking
just
as
the
krombacher
weizen
was
a

on

end
of
the

too
is
the
krombacher
dark
a

wimpy
a

not

lovers
this
one
has

roasted

reminds

the

a

quite
hazy
with

i
dont
get
much
in
the
way
of
smell
maybe
a
slightly

flavor
but
that
is
to
be
expected
with
a
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
bright
and
bubbly
and
lighttomedium
bodied
the
initial
taste
is
nutty
bitter
with
some
toast
theres
not
much
in
the
way
of
aftertaste
at
5
this
is
highly
drinkable
overall
i
enjoy
this
and
would
buy
again
in
finishing
i
think
the
beer
is
much
better
in
glass
after
its
warmed
much
smoother
with
its
sweetness
cutting
some
of
its
bitterness
my
review
will
be
as
drank
from
a
can
good
not
great
a
few
changes
to
the
recipe
and
bottled
and
this
black
lager
could
be
great
overall
this
is
far
from
being
a
bad
beer
its
clean
it
has
all
the
right
flavors
and
aromas
with
nothing
standing
out
where
it
shouldnt
no
off
flavors
that
i
could
detect
it
just
seems
a
bit
shy
like
a
wallflower
at
the
homecoming
dance
the
biggest
complaint
against
this
beer
is
not
about
what
it
is
but
what
it
could
easily
be
its
a
solid
almost
brew
and
one
id
almost
grab
off
the
shelf
again
o
still
a
really
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
this
isnt
available
locally
but
would
probably
be
a
go
to
session
beer
easy
to
drink
from
the
can
and
tasty
if
it
was
the
crack
was
loud
and
inspiring
so
i
employed
an

to
hit
me
mouthfeel
was

and
full
and
the
taste
was
both
caramel
and
chocolate
and
i
was
really
digging
it
i
ate
some
spicy
curried
chicken
for
lunch
and
this
was
a
welcome
respite
from
the
heat
finish
was
smoky
chocolaty
and
caramel
this
was
more
in

with
what
i

from

and

that
i
had
another
for
the

nothing
special
about
this
beer
mediocre
at
best
with
the
likeness
of
stoutlike
char
upon
a
body
of
lager
schlaflys
black
lager
is
easy
drinking
and
characterful
but
without
the
challenge
of
highly
complex
flavors
or
high
alcohol
rates
its
ideal
for
barbecue
and
chocolate
desserts
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
no
wonder
they
canned
it
and
made
it
part
of
their
can
sessions
lineup
the
black
lager
introduces
a
strong
roasted
and
smokey
flavor
to
the
wheat
taste
of
a
basic
lager
it
can
best
be
described
as
an
alcoholic
iced
coffee
with
a
little
wheat
to
it
i
personally
love
it
but
it
wasnt
released
in
2012
in
2013
schlafly
released
a
canned
version
which
ill
review
separately
after
ive
given
it
a
try
overall
not
as
roasty
as
i
had
hoped
its
pretty
sweet
for
the
style
and
lacks
complexity
of
the
malt
character
m
thin
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
feels
for
the
most
part
like
a
lager
but
the
hops
were
a
little
aggressive
and
took
away
some
of
the
smoothness
that
i
normally
look
for
in
a
good
lager
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
1292011
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
mahogany
brown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
both
the
head
retention
and
lacing
are
decent
enough
the
brew
smells
like
roasted
and
bready
malt
coffee
nuts
and
some
chocolate
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
caramel
and
a
bit
of
an
earthy
flavor
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
its
a
solid
brew
overall
id
buy
this
one
again
hopefully
a
fresher
bottle
next
time
around
still
even
now
its
worth
a
try
at
1
75
for
a
single
bottle
purchased
at
party
town
florence
ky
not
a
complex
beer
but
tasty
overall
b
o
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
stick
with
the
apa
but
for
something
different
pick
it
up
and
try
it
its
much
better
than
a
standard
lager
it
doesnt
take
much
to
drink
it
swiftly
and
the
flavor
doesnt
take
much
getting
used
to
because
there
is
none
this
beer
is
paltry
to
a
beer
advocate
the
only
application
i
can
think
of
is
someone
who
enjoys
bland
lagers
but
wants
to
be
seen
drinking
something
heavier
overall
quite
a
tasty
schwarz
everything
id
expect
clean
dark
and
quenching
but
its
that
persistent
pecan
note
really
making
this
delicious
o
very
enjoyable
offering
not
an
overpowering
beer
but
still
a
beer
with
lots
of
character
compared
to
other
of
this
style
i
have
tried
well
worth
checking
out
overall
this
beer
is
true
to
style
and
pretty
authentic
its
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
thin
and
somewhat
unbalanced
beer
for
this
style
looks
great
but
doesnt
taste
amazing
the
mouthfeel
is
above
average
for
the
style
it
is
light
like
a
lager
should
be
its
a
wet
sweet
beer
but
it
isnt
too
slick
like
poor
lagers
can
be
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
schwarzbier
apart
from
the
appearance
schlalfy
made
a
faithful
rendition
of
the
style
merely
being
faithful
doesnt
make
this
a
good
beer
but
it
certainly
isnt
a
bad
one
o
this
is
a
quality
schwarzbier
schlafly
continues
to
impress
me
overall
impression
while
having
this
many
times
before
once
again
great
would
enjoy
many
more
to
come
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
schlafly
this
month
and
will
be
going
back
to
this
would
recommend
grabbing
a
6pack
of
this
because
your
friends
will
also
enjoy
this
smooth
easy
going
black
bier
enjoy
good
take
on
the
style
easy
to
drink
as
usual
these
guys
do
a
good
beer
at
a
nice
price
overall
i
was
expecting
this
one
to
be
a
little
more
hoppy
but
the
malts
taste
great
and
the
feel
makes
for
a
great
drink
the
nose
does
all
right
but
it
could
have
more
to
offer
try
it
if
you
see
it
overall
i
am
pretty
impressed
with
this
lager
light
enough
to
drink
a
few
but
flavorful
enough
to
bring
satisfaction
i
recommend
it
medium
body
with
a
lightly
roasty
aftertaste
im
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
one
o
this
is
a
very
solid
schwarzbier
schlafly
is
so
consistently
good
with
everything
they
brew

clear
dark

nearly

hurt
by

less
from

more
from
black

dark

but
clean
and

clearing
lager
nevertheless
i
found
it
very
refreashing
guess
i
sampled
the
late
2004
batch
i
liked
the
pour
deep
brown
with
good
lite
brown
head
that
left
small
laces
it
had
that
black
beer
aroma
to
it
earthy
grainy

just
a
hint
of
malt
taste
was
very
good
low
carbonation
with
almost
no
hop
kick
nice
lite
to
medium
texture
thoughout
the
pint
could
drink
many
of
these

if
the
taproom
didnt
offer
so
many
other
enticing
libations
the
nose
is
of
light
malt
and
not
much
else
there
is
no
strong
sense
of
roasting
or
other
delightful
dark
beer
taste
the
feel
is
light
and
finishes
thin
but
not
lifeless
it
is
not
so
much
that
this
is
bad
beer
but
rather
that
this
is
just
so
average
dark
brownish
almost
black
in
color
nice
wispy
brown
head
that
leaves
a
good
lacing
faint
roasted

light

with
just
not

finish
pretty

for
the
style
pours
a
deep

the
aroma
is
all
malt
with
hints
of

off
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
and
roasted
grains
then
opens
up
to
a
smooth

ends
with

along
with
a
touch
of
roasted

bitterness
and
toasted

thintomedium
in

with
a
mildly

that
adds
to

overall
a
solid
schwarzbier
schwarzbier
is
not
a
style
i
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
however
this
one
definitely
seemed
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
style
other
than
the
color
that
being
said
it
was
a
pleasant
quaff
but
i
only
had
a
single
pint
before
i
returned
to
the
excellence
of
their
caskconditioned
pale
ale
best
beer
i
had
on
oceania
shit
yeah
coffee
chocolate
notes
ash
as
well
not
bad
3
55
because
its
a
well
made
beer
just
lacking
that
extra
something
of
a
really
great
beer
overall
a
very
nice
dark
beer
from
monteiths
i
headed
into
this
one
with
a
little
trepidation
as
monteiths
is
a
bit
hit
or
miss
well
complex
and
easy
drinking
great
for
a
price
of
au55
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
also
2014
the
ice
cold
serving
temp
probably
doesnt
help
its
cause
just
another
brew
that
i
wont
remember
down
the
road
o
solid
version
of
style
o
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
overall
no
thanks
i
didnt
enjoy
this
at
all
but
am
not
sure
if
it
is
the
beer
or
just
the
style
as
i
havent
had
another
schwarzbier
before
i
think
i
can
understand
what
it
is
trying
to
achieve
so
i
will
try
to
find
a
better
example
of
the
style
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
could
well
be
my
highest
scoring
beer
of
this
style
so
far
i
cant
believe
i
have
not
reviewed
this
ive
had
it
plenty
a
time
but
to
be
honest
its
been
a
while
and
thought
why
notit
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
hue
with
a
three
finger
creamy
head
that
stays
and
leaves
heaps
of
lacingthe
smell
is
black
coffeecaramel
maltsherbal
hops
and
dark
chocolatethe
mouthfeel
is
just
over
light
bodied
and
very
sessionable
and
has
tastes
of
dark
belgian
chocolatecaramel
maltsherbal
hopscocoa
and
finished
just
like
a
black
coffee
bittersweet
and
overall
i
like
what
someone
stated
earlier
monteiths
is
just
like
australias
james
squire
its
above
average
and
usually
best
option
at
a
countryor
lame
pub
but
theres
way
better
out
there
thats
for
sure
cheers
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
lacks
a
little
in
complexity
to
really
make
you
wanting
more
a
little
disappointing
in
the
finish
food
match
copy
and
paste
from
the
4
pines
stout
rack

roasted
meat

meat
side
of
roasted
vegetables
and
heavy
gravy
or
a
nice
warm
stew
dessert
dark
chocolate
follow
with
a
glass
of
port
i
expect
a
schwarzbier
to
be
a
little
darker
the
beer
appeared
black
until
the
light
hit
it
and
then
it
was
a
little
too
light
a
little
too
brown
i
got
a
good
roasty
smell
from
the
beer
and
the
taste
did
not
disappoint
more
roasty
goodness
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
more
without
a
problem
od
not
a
bad
schwarz
but
largely
forgettable
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
pretty
average
served
a

on
short
side
in
length
and
balanced
one
of
the
better
montheiths
ive
had
here
a
light
carbonation
and
lightly
bodied
considering
the
style
thin

feel
low
fizz
and
not
much
head
smells
of
charcoal
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
vegemite
low
acidity
and
very
clean
on
the
palate
for
a
dark
beer
without
much
of
an
aftertaste
the
flavour
is
fairly
straight
forward
with
hints
of
caramel
biscuit
as
it
warms
up
very
smooth
easy
drinking
poured
a
dark
chocolate
almost
black
with
a
foamy
head
that
left
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
malt

chocolate
tastes
very
much
like
it
smells
with
the
malt

caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
slight
sarsparilla
aftertaste
not
a
very
heavy
on
the
mouth
beer
for
what
it
is
but
still
nice
and
smooth
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
seek
it
out
again
o
a
very
drinkable
dark
beer
the
first
monteiths
ive
enjoyed
this
much
good
session
beer
o
suprisingly
good
id
drink
more
of
these
not
a
challenging
dark
beer
for
a
beginner
overall
impression
since
im
not
sure
if
ive
had
this
style
before
very
easy
drinking
and
nice
roasty
flavorful
german
lager
that
ends
up
being
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
month
from
an
import
wish
this
was
available
in
the
states
would
like
to
enjoy
another
one
could
do
with
more
carbonation
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
dark
black
body
the
head
was
fluffy
and
ran
colored
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
roasted
and
had
some
acidic
aromas
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
like
light
burnt
coffee
with
some
nuts
and
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
to
finish
things
off
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
and
wasnt
too
bad
overall
it
was
a
pretty
typical
black
lager
not
too
much
to
rave
about
o
good
malt
character
and
fair
balance
the
acidic
note
and
seeming
masked
hopping
were
drawbacks
for
me
i
had
this
on
draft
at
the
brewery
and
bottle
from
store
very
nice
flavor
compared
to
other
nz
beers
but
not
great
by
us
craft
beer
standards
was
my
go
to
while
in
nz
malty
and
smooth
not
a
lot
of
hops
in
this
at
all
its
black
thick
head
on
the
pour
but
went
away
quickly
and
a
light
drinking
beer
d
good
in
places
but
bad
in
others
dr
its
a
good
beer
at
a
high
price
its
abv
is
moderately
present
in
the
taste
which
is
problematic
all
around
a
beer
worth
trying
good
session
beer
from
the
kiwis
dr
very
good
but
not
great
cant
figure
the
off
odortaste
that
showed
up
a
couple
of
times
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
overall
the
acidic
finish
keeps
this
beer
from
garnering
a
higher
score

the
astringency

like
this

none

does
nothing
wrong
but
doesnt
wow
in
any
way
heck
i
really
just
wanted
to
try
a
bee
rfrom
new
zealand
so
no
loss
this
isnt
bad
it
isnt
very
complex
but
it
is
nicely
brewed
and
smooth
drinkabilitya
drinkable
brew
from
monteiths
one
of
the
better
beers
they
brew
and
its
good
beer
for
the
price
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
nice
example
glad
i
picked
this
up
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
but
you
can
do
better
worth
a
try
but
only
if
there
arent
any
other
options
available
my
first
kiwi
brew
and
without
kiwis
no
less
it
pours
a
translucent
rubybrown
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
which
leaves
some
decent
lacing
behind
as
it
fades
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
chocolate
syrup
molasses
and
light
florals
the
taste
holds
notes
of
these
elements
though
instead
of
straight
flowers
a
light
floral
bitterness
pervades
the
body
is
a
fairly
light
medium
with
a
lightly
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
feel
overall
a
solid
schwarz
i
hope
i
can
get
some
more
kiwis
if
theyre
anything
like
this
one
overall
overall
the
beer
was
enjoyable
i
thought
the
flavor
was

good
with
great
notes

and
roasted

very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
most
beer
drinkers
try
this
its
a
very
easy
drinking
dark
beer
really
drinkable
good
take
on
the
style
this
held
up
well

montieths
if
you
have
to
go
there
which
i
advise
that
you
dont
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
nose
some
flavor
very
smooth
but
nothing
amazing
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
crispness
making
this
drinkable
and
sessionable
but
not
sure
id
want
to
get
too
bored
one
of
the
lightest
black
beers
ive
ever
had
a
great
beer
for
after

you
want

to
the
smell
again
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has

drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
beer
fairly

a
nice

pretty
good

is
mostly
malty

with
a
touch
more
roast
and
a
bit
of

in
the
flavor
i
guess
if
schwarzbier
is
your
thing
then
youll
like
this
one
for
me
its
all
a
tad
thin
and
uninteresting
and
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
american
and
german
versions
the
palate
opens
roasty

with

this
finishes
great
with
some
mild
bitterness
while

in

with

initial
taste

same
with

aftertaste
the
thinner
body
was
refreshing
all
well
balanced
and
extremely
smooth
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
lighter
style
dark
which
i
normally
dont
like
but
i
think
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
enjoy
them
all
mouthfeel
is
accurately
described
on
the
label
as
never
heavy
in
texture
it
is
a
better
than
average
beer
very
pleasant
tastes
drier
than
the
smell
led
me
to
believe
its
sweeter
than
average
not
bad
at
all
i
like
the
fact
that
it
shares
some
qualities
with
porter
while
at
the
same
time
being
so
different

overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
a
nice
and
roasted
flavor
while
still
maintaining
a
light
and
drinkable
body
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
it
makes
for
a
nice
and
sessionable
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
wintertime
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
from
the
taste
to
the
aroma
to
the
mouthfeel
this
was
just
what
i
would
expect
from
a
good
schwarzbier
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
looking
but
i
thought
the
head
could
have
been
a
little
better
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
schwarzbier
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
i
was
looking
for
a
good
schwarzbier
and
this
beer
delivered
good
job

this
was
a
good

i
enjoyed

here
that

introduce
someone
to

thin
enough
to
keep

drinker
unoffended
and
enough
flavor
to
keep
a
seasoned
craft
beer
drinker
interested
a
good
session
brew
for
get
togethers
good
overall
one
of
the
more
characterful
beers
ive
tried
from
fort
collins
the
roast
burnt
flavor
is
a
bit
overwhelming
though
o
pretty
satisfying
on
this
cool
summer
night
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
in
search
of
o
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
i
think
this
one
relies
heavily
on
burntroasted
malts
for
a
schwarzbier
giving
it
flavors
akin
to
a
stout
instead
of
a
lager
an
interesting
beer
this
could
be
a
good
sessionable
beer
as
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
but
it
is
acidic
enough
that
it
prevents
it
from
being
a
good
sessionable
beer
for
me
good
flavors
despite
them
being
all
over
the
place
the
thinness
really
ruins
this
beer
though
thin
bodies
have
their
place
but
the
flavors
of
a
schwarzbier
hold
up
better
in
something
a
little
thicker
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
offering
from
fcb
that
i
have
tried
so
far
they
did
a
great
job
crafting
a
beer

a

that
is

not

from

they
make
perhaps
forgetting
strict
adherence
to

is
the
way
to
go
with
this
beer
and
it
has
a

harsh

overall

unremarkable
rauchbier
fanatics
may
be
attracted
on

of
the

the
bad

lack

turn
me
off
to
it
generally
a
good
schwarzbier
though
perhaps
too
influenced

nuances
quite
drinkable
sessionable
and
a
surprisingly
hearty
brew
for
days
of
craving
roasted

flavors
o
easily
drinkable

decent

i
likely
wont
pick
up
more
but
willing
to
check
out
some
of
their
other
offerings
o
im
alright
with
it
im
disappointed
with
how
quickly
the
flavor
finishes
i
find
after
15
seconds
there
is
no
remaining
tastes
this
i
think
is
just
the
beer
being
a
relatively
light
beer
which
i
was
not
expecting
a
pleasant
surprise
not
sure
on
the
date
of
this
beer
bought
a
single
loose
bottle
at
the
local
liquor
store
o
clean
and
very
sessionable
i
enjoyed
the
smoked
malts
that
found
their
way
in
and
feel
fortunate
to
have
gotten
to
try
this
thanks
again
over
all
not
at
all

youre
a

just
constant

the

a
hint
of
dark

somewhat
sweet
the
taste
is
somewhat
interesting
i
guess
it
is
the
chocolate
malts
but
every
sip
i
get
a
toasted
marshmallow
that
picks
up
about
12
way
thru
then
finishes
and
just
lingers
the
sweet
chocolate
sticks
to
the
tongue
a
bit

there
is

very

it

well
the

i
guess
for

its
good
but
was
wanting
more
overall
i
feel
this
is
good

this

beer
if
they
upped
the
body
a

this

be
excellent
but
its
still
good

certainly
lends

with
a

overall
not
a
bad
little
black
lager
honestly
pretty
easy
drinkability
if
you
like
dark
beers
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
o
great
beer
quite
possibly
the
best
lager
ive
had
in
a
while
o
the
winner
of
the
fort
collins
mix
pack
is
the
kidd
lager
excellent
flavour
and
very
much
to
style
the
smoked
malt
adds
a
nice
touch
just
wish
i
got
more
than
the
one
bottle
in
the
mix
pack
will
buy
again
not
bad
if
simple
a
very
thin
consistency
doesnt
mean
its
lacking
in
flavor
it
does
fine
for
itself
just
dont
go
in
expecting
a
really
chocolatefilled
beer
here
its
like
a
thin
stout
really
o
i
like
this
beer
i
think
is
very
well
crafted
balanced
and
right
in
style
very
nice
quite
drinkable
with
the
low
body
and
spirits
good
session
beer
if
you
like
the
hop
plenitude
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
cola
brown
with
a
pinky
finger
of
tan
head
that
receded
a
bit
quickly
to
a
spotty
layer
then
to
nothing
at
all
left
some
nice
lacing
nice
aroma
roasty
malts
leather
tobacco
and
very
heavy
on
the
molasses
smokey
flavor
smokey
up
front
with
more
roasted
malts
nuttiness
and
some
coffee
bitterness
in
the
middle
distinct
dark
sugar
sweetness
in
the
end
but
finishes
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
love
this
beer
very
complex
for
a
schwarzbier
which
usually
is
just
malts
malts
and
more
malts
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
slightly
heavier
than
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
cheers
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
its
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
very
sessionable
o
enjoyable
overall
could
drink
two
or
three
in
a
sitting
a
great
session
beer
finally
something
from
fcb
i
can
embrace
a
quencher
for
these
spring
months
for
when
the
weather
could
be
anything
not
something
i
would
recommend
by
any
means
fort
collins
brewery
has
a
lot
more
to
offer
this
style
is
definetely
my
under
the
radar
favorite
so
many
ive
tried
i
have
been
really
satisfied
with
poured
aggressively
to
give
no
head
nor
lacing
color
is
black
aroma
of
heavily
roasted
malts
chocolate
malts
and
some
smoked
malts
touch
of
caramel
taste
is
heavy
in
roastedslightlyburnt
malts
touch
of
smoke
probably
only
a
5
abv
brew
pretty
smooth
no
heavy
unpleasant
bitterness
not
bad
the
kidd
black
lager
pours
very
dark
brown
but
you
can
see
through
it
when
held
to
light
smells
of
some
roastiness
and
coffee
i
think
the
best
way
to
describe
this
is
the
flavors
of
a
porter
but
with
the
texture
and
mouthfeel
of
a
bud
light
its
lighter
and
less
bitter
than
a
porter
but
with
very
similar
flavors
theres
some
roast
some
smoke
subtle
coffee
and
chocolate
i
like
it
but
i
feel
like
something
is
missing
d
taste
like
it
smells
with
a
heavy
burnt
coffee
aftertaste
not
very
good
d
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
reminded
me
of
old
engine
oil

poured
from
a

9
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
first
off
its
a
european
lager
not
an
ale
so
its
more
mellow
and
easy
to
drink
at
the
same
time
it
packs
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
you
can
drink
this
one
all
day
all
the
time
very
drinkable
with
an
outstanding
malty
taste
a
great
session
beer
o
nice
aroma
on
this
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
pretty
middleoftheroad
glad
i
got
to
try
an
authentic
version
of
the
style
though
pretty
good
import
nice
dark
color
and
strong
taste
definitely
has
some
sweetness
with
that
molasses
taste
flavor
is
roasty
and
lightly
chocolatey
with
an
underlying
nutty
slightly
sweet
toasted
malt
character
throughout
the
finish
is
slightly
acrid
and
dry
o
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
hop
presence
the
best
by
date
is
715
so
it
cant
be
too
old
other
than
that
i
thought
it
was
true
to
the
style
very
approachable
and
drinkable
schwarzbier
malts
and
molasses
some
coffee
but
finishes
clean
with
little
lingering
flavors
with
low
abv
can
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
loved
it
its
an
easy
enough
beer
to
drink
with
enough
flavour
to
keep
you
interested
throughout
the
whole
pint
if
you
want
a
crisp
refreshing
yet
dark
beer
to
have
a
few
of
in
one
sitting
it
will
do
the
job
but
dont
expect
strong
flavours
that
you
would
hope
from
a
stout
porter
or
even
other
dark
lagers
with
the
alcohol
being
as
low
as
it
was
this
almost
didnt
feel
like
beer
either
not
as
full
as
a
brown
ale
or
a
porter
this
showcased
the
lager
aspects
of
it
while
being
similar
to
a
vienna
lager
when
it
came
to
the
hue
body
and
range
of
flavors
this
would
make
for
a
decent
dessert
beer
as
the
flavor
profile
led
itself
to
that
enjoy
this
class
while
lamenting
that
more
examples
of
this
arent
readily
available
this
style
certainly
has
a
lot
of
untapped
potential
would
be
a
great
beer
for
my
keggerator
because
its
full
of
flavor

i

this
is

the
first
or
one
of
the
first
beers
of
this
style
ever
brewed
so
i
guess
it
is
a
bench
mark
for
the
style
very
much
like
a
light
german
pilsner
but
with
a
bit
of
a
doppelbock
aspect
to
it
it
refreshing
and
something
you
could
call
sessionable
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
and
wanted
something
light
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
one
ive
had
a
few
american
examples
of
the
style
and
they
werent
quite
as
good
as
this
one
excellent
and
drinks
without
too
much
sweetness
a
good
black
lager
prost
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
nice
example
of
a
schwarzbier
it
had
everything
that
i
would
expect
from
a
classic
german
example
of
the
style
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
not
too
crisp
a
little
silky
dry
finish
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
after
that
the
lack
of
carbonation
might
start
to
wear
on
me
and
i
think
this
would
make
for
a
nice
late
summer
and
fall
time
beer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
it
had
just
about
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
bad
but
it
needed
a
little
more
carbonation
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
schwarzbier
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
just
about
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
was
pretty
happy
with
it
its
nice
to
have
a
nice
canned
schwarzbier
thats
readily
available
this
made
for
a
nice
first
impression
of
this
brewery
and
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
more
of
their
beers
its
one
of
the
better
german
made
schwarzbiers
ive
had
nice
job
guys
keep
up
the
good
work
o
overall
this
was
very
refreshing
light
and
nonoffensive
the
extreme
maltiness
of
this
was
a
change
of
pace
very
unique
o
good
drinkability
great
german
schwarzbiers
even
for
the
not
big
fans
of
this
style
like
me
this
one
was
ok
but
not
really
a
world
beater
would
like
to
have
tried
it
a
bit
fresher
as
it
was
probably
better
smells
especially
nice
very
bready
and
sweet
with
caramel
and
dates
as
well
pours
a
nice
medium
to
dark
brown
light
carbonation
and
head
tastes
fresh
and
clean
not
heavy
but
also
not
at
all
weak
or
flavorless
just
a
solid
drinkable
beer
would
do
well
with
spicy
or
salty
meat
i
came
across
this
beer
by
accident
i
was
in
the
growler
and
grill
in
ny
and
they
had
this
on
tap
and
in
bottles
i
purchased
some
bottles
and
the
beer
was
well
balance
smooth
and
tasted
good
the
tap
version
of
the
beer
was
as
smooth
virtually
identical
as
the
bottle
version
for
me
this
was
just
the
perfect
beer
amongst
the
best
i
have
ever
tasted
personally
i
am
into
dark
beer
and
not
the
hoppy
type
i
hope
this
helps
great
beer
o
its
not
complex
but
is
definitely
well
made
and
tastes
as
such
its
refreshing
yet
provides
some
darker
and
toastier
malt
characteristics
the
sweet
berries
are
nice
at
the
end
of
the
mouth
my
all
time
favorite
this
is
a
great
dark
beer
nice
malty
flavor
with
a
surprisingly
crisp
and
fresh
mouthfeel
doesnt
feel
heavy
or
warming
at
allinstead
tastes
light
and
refreshing
malts
are
pronounced
but
mild
enough
for
this
beer
to
be
highly
drinkable
beautiful
dark
color
would
highly
recommend
a
nice
accidental
discovery
that
paired
quite
well
with
the
weiner
schnitzel
mouthfeel
finishes
clean
with
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
back
mediumbodied
average
carbonation
o
its
just
a
good
all
around
schwarzbier
perfect
for
any
time
of
year
especially
the
cool
evenings
of
april
it
goes
with
a
lot
of
foods
or
by
itself
nice
complement
to
brats
pickles
kraut
and
mustard
prost
this
is
my
go
to
bier
everyone
assumes
it
is
heavy
like
a
porter
or
a
stout
it
is
a
perfectly
balanced
light
bier
it
is
just
dark
in
color
i
love
surprising
people
with
its
great
flavor
year
round
everyone
should
try
it
just
once
it
may
just
become
your
favorite
bier
this
is
quite
simply
one
of
the
benchmarks
for
what
a
schwarzbier
should
be
and
what
its
capable
of
doing
theres
a
barley
kick
in
here
thats
unlike
your
typical
dark
lager
and
it
simply
demands
to
be
paired
with
bratwurst
and
brown
mustard
due
to
its
robust
smoky
slightly
charred
flavor
really
good
and
i
could
easily
have
two
of
these
in
one
session
highly
recommended
o
i
found
myself
wishing
it
was
just
a
tiny
bit
creamier
and
just
a
tiny
bit
sweeter
but
overall
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
would
gladly
drink
again
a
very
nice
looking
sessionable
beer
one
ive
enjoyed
on
tap
and
in
bottles
in
both
the
us
and
germany
the
taste
is
toasty
with
elements
of
prunes
in
red
wine
licorice
earth
and
hint
of
chocolate
i
found
it
on
tap
to
be
less
dry
and
thin
of
character
only
slightly
dryish
with
a
light
sweetness
and
light
toastylicrorice
bitterness
it
is
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
on
tap
the
body
was
slightly
fuller
and
more
satisfying
than
when
i
had
it
in
the
bottle
when
it
seemed
thinner
a
very
tasty
maltforward
schwarzbier
relatively
light
in
body
compared
to
many
dark
ale
styles
yet
packed
with
great
taste
aroma
and
mouthfeel
i
know
the
ba
style
description
emphasizes
hop
bitterness
for
the
style
but
this
one
really
brings
the
rich
dark
malt
sugars
and
flavors
smooth
deep
and
intriquing
with
a
lager
smoothness
combined
with
a
delicious
roasted
grain
charm
o
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
having
never
had
a
schwarzbier
before
i
was
really
surprised
by
sessionabilitydrinkability
of
this
beer
i
could
have
easily
had
a
few
more
if
they
were
available
while
i
would
not
say
that
this
is
the
most
spectacular
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
would
happily
have
more
and
would
gladly
share
it
with
friends
final
thoughts
all
in
all
a
positive
experience
with
the
pros
outweighing
the
cons
i
kinda
get
the
feeling
im
not
being
quite
as
charitable
with
this
review
as
i
should
this
being
my
first
schwarzbier
but
ive
had
other
dark
lagers
and
dunkels
before
which
seemed
lighter
and
more
flavourful
either
way
id
recommend
it
there
is
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
this
offering
a
nice
tasting
beer
throughout
and
one
that
whilst
i
enjoyed
could
have
used
being
a
lot
stronger
oh
so
delicious
and
beautiful
held
up
to
the
light
it
yields
a
lovely
red
hue
in
the
glass
while
retaining
its
head
throughout
the
entire
session
the
smell
yields
malt
and
roast
and
the
taste
is
dry
and
roasted
with
malt
to
follow
little
obvious
presence
of
hops
but
this
yields
a
very
wellbalanced
easy
drinking
and
savorable
dark
beer
that
appeals
i
could
drink
this
every
day
serving
type
11
2
oz
bottle
this
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
malty
with
hints
of
toasted
grains
the
taste
neither
is
a
decent
texture
that
isnt
too
thin
nor
thin
the
delivers
a
bold
black
lager
taste
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
roasted
and
toasted
flavors
without
being
as
bold
or
thick
as
a
stout
pretty
decent
brew
for
its
style
o
a
highly
drinkable
black
lager
with
a
very
balanced
flavor
profile
and
very
nice
malt
bill
and
of
course
serve
it
ice
cold
in
a
pint
glass
if
possible
nice
beer
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
a
forward
malty
sweetness
but
a
low
bitterness
that
just
tickles
the
palate
at
the
end
and
fades
nice
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
enjoyable
not
too
pretentious
in
what
it
is
trying
to
be
and
is
just
a
really
solid
delicious
beer
kind
of
smokey
kind
of
ashey
there
is
some
charred
malt
flavor
very
clean
but
somewhat
palate
drying
this
beer
is
certainly
easy
on
the
system
holds
some
taste
principles
of
a
rauchbier
but
the
feel
of
a
lager
its
a
good
mix
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
impression
nice
change
of
pace
from
standard
munich
helles
or
dunkel
the
roasty
flavor
shines
in
this
distinctive
german
lager
style
o
this
is
the
king
of
schwarzbier
a
lager
to
present
to
the
naysayers
who
think
lagers
have
no
character
and
at
such
a
mild
abv
too
as
roasty
as
some
porters
and
stouts
but
with
the
clean
finish
that
can
only
be
the
result
of
bottom
fermentation
and
long
cool
storage
overall

this
is
a
damn
nice
schwarzbier
style
all
around
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
flavors
with
good
robustness
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
the
flavor
is
smooth
with
enough
sharpness
to
keep
it
defined
while
not
getting
bogged
down
by
being
cloying
or
overly
sweet
the
roast
profile
gives
it
enough
of
an
edge
to
keep
its
definition
being
what
it
was
i
liked
this
beer
its
approachable
interesting
and
im
looking
forward
to
another
the
beer
appears
a
dark
black
with
red
hues
when
looking
carefully
the
head
is
retained
for
a
moment
this
beer
smelled
of
stinky
cereal
when
it
was
first
poured
but
once
it
settled
i
get
some
smoky
nutty
and
some
spiciness
to
it
for
all
my
apprehensiveness
this
beer
hits
it
out
of
the
park
the
malty
flavor
takes
over
the
palate
the
hop
character
is
downplayed
but
i
enjoyed
the
malty
backbone
on
top
of
the
unmistakable
germain
crispness
that
their
lagers
tend
to
have
the
body
is
light
and
very
lagerlike
overall
id
definitely
drink
it
again
id
say
this
is
a
perfect
fall
beer
for
all
you
porter
and
stout
fans
a
great
buy
wonderful
flavor
drinkability
and
finish
overall
i
am
going
to
have
to
concur
with
the
ba
guys
and
conclude
that
this
is
world
class
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
i
really
cant
find
any
fault
with
it
at
all
its
light
enough
that
the
sweetness
is
not
annoying
and
it
serves
to
balance
it
also
5
out
of
5
highly
recommended
this
is
often
my
goto
lager
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
dark
one
of
the
better
black
lagers
in
my
opinion
probably
would
be
much
better
on
tap
as
the
age
of
this
bottle
is
unknown
and
probably
quite
old
500ml
can
for
a
tasty
price
of
a
buck
seventynine
the
pour
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
dark
like
a
stout
but
thinner
darker
than
most
schwarzbiers
made
in
the
usa
with
a
gorgeous
white
head
maybe
just
off
white
rising
several
inches
high
before
slowly
relaxing
the
nose
is
medium
roast
malts
and
some
spent
lager
yeast
i
dont
know
why
but
the
yeast
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
here
adding
too
much
flavor
for
a
lager
and
there
is
enough
sweetness
from
the
malts
that
it
just
doesnt
crisp
up
sort
of
a
weird
mix
maybe
more
hops
would
fix
this
problem
but
things
are
just
out
of
balance
for
me
long
funny
finish
im
sure
this
is
far
superior
on
tap
at
the
source
but
in
the
imported
can
context
it
just
doesnt
stack
up
thin
medium
body
and
comfortingly
brisk
carbonation
but
this
was
a
miss
for
me
in
many
ways
o
while
it
is
a
bit
meh
flavorwise
the
drinkability
factor
is
superb
as
it
should
be
in
a
good
lager
i
wont
rush
out
to
the
store
to
buy
more
but
this
really
does
hit
the
spot
for
me
unlike
say
a
doppelbock
its
got
a
surprisingly
clean
finish
for
as
dark
as
german
as
it
is
its
a
gem
m
sensation
is
well
balanced
starting
neutral
and
ending
with
little
bitterness
sensation
also
lasts
on
the
mouth
after
ending
poured
from
a
500ml
can
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
pours
a
very
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
nice
but
shortlived
cappuccino
colored
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
has
a
nice
aroma
with
notes
of
molasses
and
coffee
the
taste
is
more
coffee
and
roast
notes
with
the
molassesmalt
sweetness
in
the
background
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
more
roast
notes
its
a
little
thin
with
almost
no
carbonation
noted
but
given
the
flavors
i
think
a
thicker
beer
would
be
overwhelming
after
a
while
as
it
is
this
is
a
great
dark
lager
that
doesnt
disappoint
final
thoughts
germanys
no
1
black
lager
beer
is
pretty
good
light
on
body
and
flavor
but
not
light
on
enjoyability
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
if
im
in
the
mood
for
an
import
the
taste
is
a
creamy
mix
of
malts
leading
to
a
parched
paper
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
of
typical
precision
of
a
soft
love
of
liquid
before
it
tickles
the
cheeks
and
gums
to
make
you
feel
all
giddy
and
child
like
like
st
nickolas
on
the
6th
of
december
with
his
candy
the
color
is
quite
artistic
until
you
taste
the
hidden
meaning
behind
the
said
work
of
art
all
in
all
not
a
bad
dark
german
lager
beats
many
other
local
offerings
here
in
texas
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
i
hoped
for
it
is
a
smooth
drinkable
black
larger
with
no
offensive
notes
for
the
style
its
worth
seeking
out
picked
up
a
six
pack
at
specs
in
san
antonio
this
is
a
quality
product
that
the
germans
are
known
for
i
would
buy
again
o
ive
been
sort
of
fatigued
with
the
apaipastout
beers
that
dominate
the
shelves
at
my
local
bottle
shops
and
have
been
exploring
german
lagers
more
extensively
this
was
a
breath
of
fresh
air
crisp
clean
but
still
full
of
charecter
and
flavor
my
exploration
of
german
imports
is
off
to
a
good
start
overall
great
beer
id
buy
it
again
if
i
could
find
it
at
my
stores
this
is
a
pretty
good
refreshing
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
sprecher
black
bavarian
or
monschof
schwarzbiers
that
ive
enjoyed
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
brilliant
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
smallish
creamy
off
white
head
musters
but
slowly
recedes
in
my
glass
smells
of
prunes
and
raisins
with
a
solid
shot
of
caramel
and
burnt
sugars
very
sweet
aroma
with
little
to
no
hop
presence
the
flavor
is
more
burnt
sugar
than
anything
else
a
light
bit
of
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
ash
round
out
the
flavor
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
burnt
sweet
watery
mouthfeel
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
very
much
there
arent
really
any
flaws
here
but
i
felt
it
was
a
bit
boring
a
very
nice
schwarz
but
i
feel
like
ive
had
better
very
nice
beer
especially
for
the
winter
o
overall
great
beer
very
tasty
went
well
with
some
lindberger
and
sharp
white
cheddar
more
roasted
malt
as
a
flavour
but
still
on
the
gentle
side
some
chocolate
and
nutty
hints
but
thats
pushing
it
its
pretty
restrained
some
of
the
cooked
vegetable
character
comes
through
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
there
are
a
lot
of
better
schwarzbiers
out
there
o
very
good
and
an
great
example
of
the
style
rjt
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
low
abv
and
lighter
body
enjoyable
and
sessionable
the
loud
crack
was
music
to
mine
ears
and
the
glug
was
a
pleasant
accompaniment
i
achieved
a
finger
of
dense
foamy
mochabrown
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
mahogany
highlights
at
the
edges
the
visual
is
why
one
should
always
decant
from
the
can
into
a
glass
i
had
to
hold
it
to
the
light
to
get
the
full
effect
nose
was
filled
with
grassy
hops
just
like
in
the
bros
description
on
this
site
i
was
ready
to
swoon
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
had
no
appreciation
for
lagers
until
i
embarked
on
the
canquest
tm
and
found
out
that
not
all
lagers
are
created
equal
mouthfeel
was
medium
approaching
fullness
but
not
quite
achieving
it
the
taste
married
the
grassiness
of
the
hops
with
the
bitterness
of
anise
and
molasses
undoubtedly
from
the
malt
finish
was
semidry
and
quite
refreshing
the
low
abv
makes
it
a
good
candidate
for
the
cooler
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
say
i
dont
like
dark
beers
sheesh
get
off
of
your
high
lovibond
horse
and
join
the
party
food
match
its
an
odd
one
to
match
as
its
neither
heavy
handed
like
other
dark
beers
but
by
the
same
token
it
isnt
light
in
flavour
as
lagers
usually
are
best
bet
would
be
a
cheese
platter
some
of
the
stronger
flavoured
cheeses
as
this
beer
is
quite
palate
cleansing
or
if
you
were
going
a
main
course
it
would
pair
well
with
heavy
whitemeats
like
duck
or
turkey
pours
black
with
just
a
sliver
of
brown
light
shining
through
the
edges
the
head
was
tan
a
little
thin
and
quickly
reduced
to
a
filmy
layer
the
aroma
is
nice
and
roasty
with
some
smoky
flavor
and
a
hint
of
coffee
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
a
slight
metallic
taste
the
beer
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
dry
roasty
finish
this
is
an
awesome
shwarzbier
light
but
full
of
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
has
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
notes
as
well
as
some
grain
the
flavor
is
nice
with
some
lightly
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
notes
there
is
also
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
as
well
as
some
grass
and
earth
notes
from
the
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
ive
now
had
this
beer
about
6
times
and
every
time
i
do
i
enjoy
it
more
its
is
very
well
balance
for
a
dark
lager
everything
is
smooth
overall
a
very
nice
lager
sweet
yet
balanced
very
drinkable
dont
be
intimidated
by
the
color
notes
dam
tasty
such
a
remarkable
and
traditional
german
style
a
very
find
and
i
will
pick
this
one
up
again
cheers
o
this
beer
is
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
like
a
pilsner
with
the
hop
flavor
traded
for
a
dry
roast
flavor
and
a
touch
more
malt
dry
and
roasty
finish
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
drinkability
there
is
a
nice
balance
throughout
that
you
dont
feel
like
you
ever
get
sick
of
it
or
that
any
one
flavor
becomes
overpowering
the
flavoring
was
rather
simple
however
and
petered
out
a
bit
by
the
end
but
there
was
a
recognizable
robustness
that
made
this
a
nice
beer
this
would
go
best
with
a
meal
of
sauerkraut
and
smoked
sausage
rather
than
as
a
standalone
beer
o
no
flaws
to
speak
of
and
nicely
smooth
and
balanced
but
the
nose
and
flavor
could
be
a
little
bit
stronger
a
nice
bready
lager
with
some
earthy
characteristics
and
a
nice
grassy
hops
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
in
the
5l
draught
can
if
you
can
find
it
i
have
had
this
beer
in
a
bottle
also
and
it
is
just
as
good
something
fun
about
the
draught
can
though
try
it
with
grilled
chicken
wingsbuffalo
bbq
or
otherwise
overall

i
have
tried
many
black
lagers
and
koerstritzer
is
head
and
shoulders
over
all
of
them
this
brew
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
lager
elements
but
with
the
slight
addition
of
smoky
grains
and
the
larger
barley
middle
of
a
stout
or
porter
this
beer
is
balanced
and
never
over
the
top
other
black
lagers
would
do
well
to
study
this
unique
balance
recommended

an
a
the
germans
are
simply
put
the
masters
of
lagerdom
though
they
seem
to
be
more
famous
for
their
pilseners
weisses
and
bocks
they
also
make
some
damn
fine
sessionable
dark
beers
kostritzer
schwarzbier
is
a
ridiculously
drinkable
testament
to
their
national
expertise
that
no
beer
geek
should
neglect
to
try
i
really
wish
this
was
available
locally
because
id
be
buying
bottles
by
the
handful
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
1
finger
of
offwhite
head
the
smell
was
roasted
malts
burnt
bread
and
a
very
subtle
hop
the
taste
was
all
lager
very
bready
with
some
roasted
malts
a
little
watery
with
a
decently
long
finish
very
average
to
me
overall
this
is
nice
sessionable
beer
overall
a
very
good
choice
no
matter
your
particular
preferences
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
great
rich
flavor
a
special
thanks
to
my
friend
who
gifted
me
this
bottle
overall
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
business
function
this
is
a
beer
that
says
i
mean
business
it
delivers
no
frills
drinking
pleasure
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
also
rather
mild
roasted
malts
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
not
a
bad
beer
i
felt
it
was
a
little
lacking
for
this
style
overall
easy
drinking
with
some
good
flavors
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
on
a
cooler
spring
or
autumn
day
o
a
good
dark
german
lager
that
i
enjoyed
with
a
few
friends
i
definitely
recommend
getting
one
of
these
if
you
can
but
make
sure
to
plan
on
drinking
it
all
because
it
will
go
flat
and
be
a
waste
love
when
a
brewer
totally
nails
a
style
and
i
must
say
that
this
is
the
best
schwarzbier
i
have
had
yet
the
burnt
malt
notes
are
surrounded
with
a
luscious
mouthfeel
that
i
have
not
found
in
most
black
beers
the
beer
is
so
well
balanced
that
you
want
another
as
soon
as
finish
the
first
its
a
nice
lager
but
ive
had
a
stout
with
a
very
similar
taste
that
seemed
to
be
a
notch
above
my
first
sip
is
surprising
this
beer
has
clean
crisp
lager
characteristics
i
was
expecting
a
more
sweet
caramel
dull
flavor
this
was
refreshing
with
an
addition
of
deep
chocolate
caramel
flavors
this
definitely
could
be
a
carbonated
chocolate
milk
drink
if
you
close
your
eyes
a
fun
beer
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
the
carb
is
fine
but
borders
on
too
strong
overall
its
lacking
in
almost
all
dimensions
for
me
overall
delicious
and
extremely
refreshing

finish
somewhat

pleasant

quite
good
for
such
a
low
abv
worth
a
revisit
was
told
it
a
great
black
beer
and
saw
it
in
a
500
most
wanted
beers
book
apperance
and
smeel
was
really
good
taste
was
good
it
was
real
smokey
and
roasty
tasting
to
me
still
a
decent
beer
one
ill
for
sure
have
again
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
good
beer
though
give
it
a
try
this
is
an
easy
flowing
beer
though
the
flavors
are
less
than
i
had
hoped
for
o
the
label
design
reflects
the
teutonic
drinking
experience
youre
about
to
have
its
not
a
friendly
beer
but
it
has
good
form
im
not
a
schwarzbier
fan
but
i
think
my
rating
is
fair
o
for
the
style
of
schwarzbiers
options
can
be
limited
however
this
beer
seems
to
be
an
offering
thats
pretty
easy
to
find
and
is
an
allaround
solid
beer
the
flavor
isnt
one
thats
overly
complex
but
its
very
balanced
between
the
mildly
sweet
caramel
fruity
and
hoppy
flavors
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
low
abv
and
high
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
time
and
time
again
without
losing
interest
in
it
notes
flavorful
yet
light
in
body
and
very
silky
on
the
palate
an
allaround
wellmade
schwartzbier
very
sessionable
at
4
8
its
a
balanced
brew
and
an
easy
find
for
this
style
a
dark
bear
that
suits
all
seasons
o
a
clean
easy
drinking
dark
lager
looks
beautiful
in
the
glass
but
pretty
mild
on
flavor
a
fresh
and
nice
black
beer
on
tap
last
night
at
the
new
lone
star
taco
bar
in
allston
served
in
a
0
4l
radeberger
mug
light
black
color
with
a
wonderful
looking
head
that
did
not
fade
smell
had
hints
of
cocoa
powder
and
tobacco
i
liked
the
flavors
very
much
many
notes
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
deceptively
good
it
was
rich
and
creamy
at
first
but
the
more
you
drank
it
got
smoother
and
smoother
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
tons
of
flavor
and
at
under
5
abv
its
a
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
for
a
session
great
beer
and
a
bonus
at
6
for
the
large
mug
need
to
find
this
on
tap
more
often
o
it
was
fairly
good
all
things
considered
might
like
to
rereview
it
true
to
style
easy
drinking
lightly
roasty
black
lager
not
terribly
interesting
no
lingering
flavors
my
first
foray
in
reviewing
the
style
draft
pint
at
bierbrunnen
ft
lauderdale
florida
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
is
a
mild
earthy
hop
unexpected
sweet
and
sour
grass
and
earth
hop
taste
backed
by
roasty
malt
went
well
with
wiener
schnitzel
and
potato
salad
could
session
this
one
in
the
biergarten
o
this
is
a
tasty
schwarz
and
a
beer
that
would
be
good
for
an
evening
of
beer
drinking
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
12
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
malt
and
some
dark
fruits
especially
grapes
taste
is
of
dark
malt
grapelike
fruits
and
some
mild
roast
flavors
a
fleeting
shot
of
bitterness
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
with
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
schwarzbier
that
is
easy
drinking
medium
light
body
with
a
fairly
light
carbonation
overall
a
top
shelf
dark
beer
smooth
and
balanced
complex
but
well
melded
flavours
unusually
low
abv
for
such
a
big
flavoured
beer
makes
this
eminently
sessionable
this
bier
was
fine
i
can
recognize
it
as
dark
and
good
but
i
feel
like
there
is
better
out
there
i
felt
this
one
was
lacking
something
personally
the
timbre
could
have
been
more
unique
i
also
think
a
bit
more
oh
could
have
made
this
bier
taste
better
medium
to
thin
bodied
with
lower
carbonation
on
tap
than
what
id
expect
from
the
bottled
version
somewhat
dry
finish
extremely
easy
drinking
not
super
exciting
but
a
quality
classic
german
lager
nonetheless
almost
if
not
just
as
good
in
the
bottle
a
fantastic
beer
that
should
be
tried
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
style
and
the
kostritzer
is
on
the
nose
easy
drinking
and
probably
not
quite
medium
bodied
its
something
that
could
be
enjoyed
in
the
spring
or
winter
o
definitely
new
style
to
me
the
medicinal
aspects
to
this
are
a
little
odd
in
my
books
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
nice
looking
thick
tan
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
decent
and
the
retention
wasnt
bad
either
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
earthy
roasted
aromas
with
some
lager
yeast
aromas
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
some
light
chocolate
notes
along
with
a
traditional
lager
flavor
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
isnt
too
heavy
or
anything
the
carbonation
is
pretty
good
its
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
was
prettygood
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
if
the
mood
struck
me
its
got
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
a
fairly
low
abv
package
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
but
found
it
somewhat
lackluster
in
aroma
and
taste
there
isnt
much
development
from
beginning
to
end
in
either
component
which
led
to
a
bit
of
placidity
and
boredom
while
drinking
this
one
this
one
holds
up
to
its
name
until
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
revealing
a
very
deep
brown
the
head
is
large
at
first
but
quickly
drops
down
to
a
cap
of
bonewhite
aroma
is
lightly
roasty
with
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
first
sip
reveals
an
excellent
schwarzbier
it
maintains
a
nice
lagery
flavor
along
with
the
caramel
malts
and
chocolate
a
touch
of
roastiness
stops
the
finish
from
being
cloying
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
very
easydrinking
overall
a
very
nice
schwarzbier
kostritzer
schwarzbier
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
its
name
pouring
more
of
a
dark
brown
than
actual
black
there
are
a
generous
amount
of
mahogany
highlights
and
about
a
finger
of
khaki
colored
highlights
head
retention
is
brief
and
theres
not
realy
any
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
lightly
roasty
with
a
suggestion
of
milk
chocolate
theres
also
an
earthy
quality
there
the
flavor
takes
that
roasty
chocolaty
base
and
adds
a
subtle
nuttiness
as
a
second
background
note
along
with
the
earthiness
the
body
is
pleasantly
full
for
a
relatively
low
alcohol
beer
the
carbonation
starts
off
fairly
bubbly
but
mostly
dies
off
by
mid
palate
schwarzbier
isnt
a
style
i
find
myself
ordering
all
too
often
but
kostritzers
renditionof
it
is
fairly
enjoyable
o
really
dug
this
beer
its
very
tasty
and
is
a
very
easy
drinker
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
might
be
my
favorite
in
the
style
looking
forward
to
more
o
a
solid
schwarzbier
and
was
easydrinking
and
went
well
with
my
meal
at
northdown
would
def
have
again
in
the
future
love
this
beer
d
an
excellent
archetypal
example
of
an
uncommon
style
offering
rich
roasty
flavour
with
the
usual
refreshing
lager
drinkability
a
musttry
silky
and
balanced
understated
if
anything
almost
too
easy
to
sip
very
much
a
german
beer
where
the
flavors
are
suggested
rather
than
hammered
home
i
dont
want
to
have
to
work
so
hard
to
draw
out
the
good
features
of
this
wellconstructed
beer
but
its
worthwhile
o
nice
and
flavorful
well
balanced
deep
brown
near
black
one
finger
creamy
tan
head
sticky
with
some
lace
charred
and
roasted
almost
smoke
like
notes
nutty
burnt
malt
toffee
and
caramel
like
nutty
and
roasty
lightly
astringent
but
it
works
mildly
bitter
malty
burnt
charcoal
like
flavours
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
med
weight
perfect
medium
carbonation
really
solid
stuff
tasty
but
not
filling
great
beer
for
fallwinter
and
for
less
than
3
bucks
a
pint
i
will
pick
up
more
of
these
o
an
alright
beer
nothing
special
nothing
bad
was
much
to
watery
but
still
a
decent
beer
o
good
beer
nothing
that
really
wows
me
but
it
is
a
great
drinkable
beer
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
if
in
the
mood
for
a
black
lager
d
very
good
standard
for
the
style
this
is
the
first
schwarzbier
ive
tried
and
still
my
favorite
o
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
weak
for
my
tastes
not
accounting
for
personal
taste
though
it
is
a
pretty
good
schwarzbier
in
germany
youll
find
a
much
richer
beer
because
the
flavors
tend
to
stand
out
a
bit
more
i
feel
that
when
it
is
fresh
the
body
is
a
little
more
pronounced
and
that
could
be
why
this
one
seemed
a
little
weak
pours
cola
brown
light
tan
head
nose
has
light
smoke
which
is
ideal
for
swarzbiers
for
me
no
need
for
smoke
bombs
to
appeal
to
the
new
generation
of
beer
enthusiasts
nice
balance
on
the
palate
with
some
light
roast
malt
light
hops
and
very
drinkable
incredibly
refreshing
cant
wait
to
experiment
with
food
pairings
enjoyed
at
the
kasierhof
restaurant
in
ob
san
diego
which
btw
has
a
good
selection
of
draft
german
beers
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
not
your
typical
german
beer
overall
this
beer
was
a
treat
to
drink
it
did
not
taste
like
its
aroma
in
appearance
and
aroma
this
is
very
close
to
a
standard
milk
stout
or
porter
the
taste
is
refreshing
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
yes
it
tastes
like
a
lager
a
good
one
this
would
be
a
good
alternative
to
a
standard
session
beer
delicious
not
a
pounding
beer
would
no
doubt
like
to
have
again
i
had
hoped
for
something
much
more
full
flavored
but
this
isnt
bad
its
definitely
not
bitter
gross
crap
it
has
to
have
a
flavor
before
it
can
taste
bad
a
little
over
a
month
ago
i
got
a
message
from
jana
saying
her
husband
had
come
back
from
germany
this
time
with
a
case
of
kostritzer
for
me
once
again
blown
away
by
janas
thoughtfulness
ive
had
enough
to
share
with
friends
and
family
who
all
agree
that
this
old
school
brewery
knows
what
theyre
doing
their
4
millennia
of
practice
has
certainly
payed
off
great
beer
try
if
you
love
black
lager
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
on
the
tongue
ive
had
this
a
few
times
before
at
german
beer
bars
and
continue
to
go
back
for
more
while
not
explosive
on
the
palate
this
is
an
easy
drinker
for
a
darker
beer
especially
during
the
summer
months
im
not
going
to
go
into
the
chocolate
burnt
cherries
kittens
and
butterflies
stuff
drinking
this
is
fun
and
it
tastes
good
it
goes
down
smooth
isnt
overly
effervescent
and
i
love
the
aftertaste
it
would
taste
good
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
shoveling
snow
off
the
driveway
say
it
out
loud
schwarzbier
o
overall
a
pretty
good
schwarzbier
lots
of
malts
and
very
easy
to
drink
would
give
it
another
shot
this
is
the
first
schwarzbier
i
have
tried
and
im
surprised
at
how
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
this
dark
beer
is
delicious
worth
trying
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
one
is
drinkable
enough
that
i
had
a
2nd
one
after
lunch
and
found
it
pleasant
enough
that
said
i
have
had
a
couple
of
schwarzbiers
that
i
thought
had
a
bit
more
character
and
some
more
definite
flavors
other
than
the
malt
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
well
done
beer
that
would
be
an
excellent
choice
with
the
right
meal
and
for
an
evening
around
the
table
dining
and
talking
with
friends
it
seems
a
bit
ordinary
not
meant
to
distract
and
it
wouldnt
opaque
close
to
black
with
a
tan
head
that
sits
up
high
in
the
glass
rocky
lacing
as
it
falls
aromas
are
a
little
faint
but
not
by
a
lot
chalky
medicinal
yeastiness
with
a
toasted
caramel
underbelly
flavor
is
quite
mild
could
be
bigger
but
for
the
size
really
isnt
too
bad
i
enjoyed
the
moderate
bitterness
and
coplexity
in
a
schwarzbier
that
still
comes
in
under
five
per
cent
o
overall
a
decent
beer
and
a
classic
of
the
german
schwarzbier
overall
good
for
sessioning
at
a
noncraft
party
other
than
that
dont
think
ill
look
for
it
again
unless
its
on
a
tap
handle
in
germany
dark
with
some
visible
light
fluffy
big
head
and
nice
lace
big
caramel
candy
aroma
like
the
soft
chewy
candies
you
find
soft
mouth
feel
some
carbonation
but
very
subtle
the
flavor
is
a
scaled
back
version
of
the
aroma
there
is
a
bit
of
acidity
and
very
light
earthy
hops
mediumheavy
body
dark
brown
near
black
core
with
ruby
red
edges
head
tops
off
small
and
quick
aroma
of
faint
malts
grass
and
light
fruits
a
little
perfumelike
as
well
the
ultracrisp
mouthfeel
is
noticed
right
off
the
bat
followed
by
some
slight
sweet
malt
notes
tea
leaves
and
distant
light
fruits
lightbodied
and
a
bit
toasty
after
a
few
drinks
simply
wonderful
drinking
wouldnt
run
to
get
a
new
one
drinkable
but
lacking
flavour
oh
and
i
prefer
this
is
a
bottle
rather
than
canned
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
oily
slick
with
basically
no
carbonation
a
light
body
and
a
watery
feel
a
really
nice
beer
overall
that
went
down
easy
clean
refreshing
finish
a
thirstquencher
and
ideal
session
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
irish
stout
with
that
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
light
thickness
nothing
much
present
in
the
flavor
or
aroma
department
still
a
decent
and
drinkable
beer
it

stylistically

good

incredibly
smooth
and
satisfying
not
the
best
or
most
complex
brew
by
far
it
is
german
after
all
but
i
could
easily
drink
it
all
night
long
o
a
very
refreshing
favorite
for
the
warmer
months
good
example
of
this
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
style
pours

black
color
13
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
great
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
pale

slight

slight

and
hint
of
yeast
fits
the
style
of
schwarzbier
mouth
feel

sharp

crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
grain
and
hint
of
dry
hops
o
this
beer
has
some
serious
character
to
it
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
as
a
once
in
a
while
tangent
from
my
usual
pours
as
expected
its
got
a
more
carbonated
and
crisp
feel
than
a
stout
with
some
umph
in
the
flavor
department
o
a
damn
fine
schwartz
and
one
of
the
most
balanced
ive
ever
had
kostritzer
is
probably
the
benchmark
for
this
style
for
good
reason
at
4
8
abv
its
got
crazy
drinkability
with
a
flavor
balance
and
mouthfeel
that
just
wont
quit
fond
memories
have
me
thinking
ill
need
a
5liter
of
this
brew
for
an
upcoming
camping
trip
prost
so
very
drinkable
try
this
with
really
spicy
dishes
andor
a
variety
of
cheeses
and
salamis
this
pours
a
clear
brown
like
coke
with
no
head
the
aroma
has
hints
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
little
smoke
the
flavor
is
balanced
between
coffee
and
molasses
which
fades
and
honey
mixes
with
coffee
in
the
finish
its
got
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
may
pair
well
with
chocolates
as
an
after
dinner
drink
slightly
recommended
excellent
schwarzbier
it
has
a
great
balance
of
maltiness
and
light
body
with
a
solid
flavor
profile
overall
this
is
a
great
tasting
sessionable
brew
its
so
far
probably
the
best
schwarzbier
ive
had
too
bad
it
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
on
the
nose
d
not
what
you
expect
from
a
dark
beer
but
this
is
a
classic
for
this
relatively
unknown
style
in
the
states
the
beer
drinks
like
a
lager
yet
has
tons
of
flavor
nice
session
beer
or
something
new
to
try
if
you
can
find
it
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
beer
easydrinking
but
little
flavor
impact
and
quite
thin
d
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
again
dr
its
nice
for
what
it
is
and
what
it
costs
i
wouldnt
reach
for
it
again
but
its
not
too
bad
in
fairness
worth
giving
a
go
for
lovers
of
the
style
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
pours
near
black
and
is
completely
opaque
initial
singlefinger
head
sits
around
for
quite
a
bit
before
falling
leaving
behind
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
the
nose
is
a
bit
plain
with
some
roasted
malt
and
really
mild
coffee
character
the
taste
hits
the
same
notes
there
is
a
moderate
roast
presence
but
theres
nothing
to
back
it
up
the
big
problem
is
that
the
feel
is
too
thin
and
undercarbonated
theres
nothing
really
pulling
the
flavors
through
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
drank
well
before
the
best
before
date
on
bottle
of
12132011
d
i
would
drink
it
again
really
smooth
drinkable
black
lager
just
expected
more
dark
chocolate
bitterness
worth
the
dollar
i
paid
ma
thick
foamy
head
with
a
deep
rich
body
makes
this
a
filling
beer
that
i
could
have
several
in
a
quite
few
hours
of
relaxing
in
an
old
pub
great
rich
deep
very
easy
drinkable
and
so
worthy
it
is
an
ideal
session
beer
or
a
beer
for
every
household
drinkability
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
a
nice
first
beer
for
a
winters
evening
exceptional
beer
a
standard
bearer
of
the
style
and
highly
recommended
for
all
lovers
of
black
lager
an
almost
perfect
winter
session
brew
d
easy
to
drink
lighter
in
body
and
very
tasty
one
of
my
favorite
black
lagers
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
one
is
practically
as
good
in
the
bottle
as
it
is
on
draft
good
stuff
notes
over
all
this
is
a
very
well
made
and
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
best
schwarzbiers
i
have
tried
easy
drink
pretty
enjoyable
not
my
thing
but
id
drink
it
again
in
germany
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
somewhat
thin
appeared
essentially
black
in
the
glass
with
a
healthy
light
taneggshell
head
that
looks
quite
creamy
mild
retention
and
moderate
lace
plesant
nose
of
roasted
grain
chocolate
caramel
like
straight
off
a
caramel
apple
distinctly
and
molasses
taste
has
more
of
the
grain
upfront
some
noble
hops
bitterness
and
mild
chocolate
in
the
finish
good
creamy
mouthfeel
and
lingers
for
a
bit
too
decent
drinkability
good
beer
overall
d
quite
a
nice
black
beer
that
is
not
overdone
on
the
roasted
malt
and
bitterness
which
often
gives
and
astringency
and
acidity
that
is
unpleasant
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
suprisingly
easy
as
a
result
of
the
delicacy
to
which
the
flavor
and
feel
hits
your
palate
kostritzers
schwarzbier
is
easy
to
enjoy
but
flourishes
to
leave
an
excellent
carmel
laced
aftertaste
that
i
found
encouraging
another
drink
d
this
is
definitely
something
i
could
do
a
whole
night
of
fairly
low
abv
tasty
and
well
done
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
this
could
easily
be
a
goto
sessionable
lager
for
the
colder
months
d
an
easy
drink
can
enjoy
several
of
these
with
or
without
a
meal
would
be
great
with
roast
beef
and
veggies
a
little
sugary
sweet
this
might
decrease
its
overal
drinkability
for
it
might
begin
to
feel
too
rich
beautiful
black
nose
of
light
coffee
and
a
little
sweet
so
macchiato
with
some
hints
of
caramel
but
this
is
quite
subtle
mouth
still
watery
but
with
an
aftertaste
of
dark
chocolate
cake
rather
scored
small
lack
of
bitterness
however
despite
a
significant
easy
to
drink
drink
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
its
almost
like
it
has
the
best
of
both
worlds
light
like
a
lager
but
tasty
like
an
esb
it
also
had
a
really
great
appearance
worth
seeking
out
d
drinkable
smooth
and
light
a
very
good
example
of
the
german
schwarzbier
this
beer
would
be
great
with
a
smoked
cheese
or
smoked
meat
köstritzer
and
schwarzbier
in
general
is
a
lesson
in
how
you
shouldnt
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
despite
the
blackish
colour
this
beer
is
every
bit
as
smooth
lightlyflavoured
drying
and
refreshing
as
any
yellow
lager
worth
drinking
and
its
also
an
obvious
testament
to
the
germans
love
and
skill
for
brewing
super
agreeable
drinkable
lagers
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
it
thin
mouthfeel
and
light
flavors
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
as
part
of
our
german
night
dinner
the
beer
is
opaque
black
with
a
thin
filmy
yellow
head
the
aroma
is
light
with
only
hints
of
barley
the
beer
has
a
complex
balance
of
malts
and
barley
and
is
very
well
balanced
a
nice
smooth
feel
in
mouth
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
minimal
aftertaste
d
this
is
quite
drinkable
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
pretty
good
d
lots
of
flavor
for
this
abv
and
drinks
bigger
than
the
abv
would
suggest
solid
d
smooth
simple
to
drink
not
overly
complex
but
good
enough
this
time
from
a
500ml
can
bottled
in
april
pours
a
clear
dark
black
beer
with
a
beige
lasting
head
hard
to
beat
nice
light
roastiness
on
the
nose
refreshing
taste
more
malty
than
hoppy
light
roastiness
easy
drinking
beer
a
classic
in
the
style
nice
dark
coffee
color
with
medium
carbonation
and
good
retention
has
an
inviting
look
to
it
and
has
a
distinct
molasses
smell
tastes
of
caramel
linger
on
the
palate
it
is
not
overly
bitter
as
i
would
have
expected
for
a
dark
beer
pretty
smooth
with
a
light
carbonation
lighter
than
i
anticipated
recommended
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
would
be
interesting
to
take
this
same
beer
and
use
an
english
ale
yeast
rather
than
the
lager
yeast
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
schwarzbier
style
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
and
again
well
done
excellent
fairly
simple
but
so
enjoyable
overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
like
silk
and
just
the
right
feel
for
a
beer
that
is
filled
with
malt
but
still
has
a
great
finish
to
it
personal
wow
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
what
an
enjoyable
balanced
lager
i
would
love
to
host
a
dinner
and
serve
big
steaks
with
fig
and
red
wine
reduction
a
mug
of
this
by
each
place
setting
this
is
delicious
and
flavorful
without
being
overbearing
drinkable
and
delicate
without
being
a
bore
this
one
is
going
in
the
like
file
no
problem
having
another
easy
drinker
d
would
be
hard
to
have
another
3
this
is
one
of
most
easy
to
drink
dark
beers
i
have
had
this
is
one
of
the
best
schwarzbiere
available
however
köstritzer
is
much
better
ontap
the
bottle
lacked
the
creamy
mouthfeel
and
pleasant
sweetness
though
the
drinkability
remained
intact
a
solid
brew
overall
a
good
beer
worth
a
taste
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
but
didnt
blow
me
out
of
the
water
d
i
think
its
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
had
its
refreshing
subtle
and
complex
and
just
extremely
enjoyable
to
drink
first
schwarzbier
ive
had
will
definitely
be
trying
more
offerings
everything
seems
so
well
in
balance
with
this
beer
the
hops
light
roast
cocoa
and
graininess
all
come
together
very
nicely
it
is
flavorful
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
light
on
the
sweetness
and
maintains
a
lager
lightness
in
body
easy
to
go
through
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
tasty
stuff
salud
the
beer
smells
amazing
sweet
chocolaty
and
even
lightly
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
also
good
but
it
is
a
bit
dry
the
beer
is
real
easy
to
drink
one
can
have
big
sipsgulps
or
small
ones
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
the
flavors
are
smooth
and
complex
and
the
body
maintains
a
light
quality
without
losing
flavor
or
feeling
thin
drinkability
really
a
delicious
and
distinct
beer
not
too
strong
or
heavy
but
kind
of
advanced
flavors
after
2
liter
or
so
i
would
switch
to
a
less
complex
beer
as
the
tongue
gets
less
sensitive
yes
could
be
a
session
beer
but
why
get
drunken
and
numb
to
what
this
beer
has
to
offer
to
sum
up
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
ok
but
the
feel
and
the
taste
dont
really
work
so
its
hard
to
swallow
sampled
on
tap
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
many
times
a
great
example
of
what
a
schwarzbier
can
be
black
in
color
and
nearly
opaque
with
a
light
malty
nose
that
hints
at
roasted
barley
clean
and
crackery
on
the
palate
lightbodied
it
could
almost
be
mistaken
for
a
helles
lager
if
sampled
blindfolded
theres
a
hint
of
roast
and
a
mild
acidity
from
the
dark
malt
but
it
finishes
clean
and
crisp
with
barely
a
trace
of
bitterness
drinkability
is
quite
highas
is
appropriate
to
the
style
with
the
dark
somewhat
oily
complexion
you
would
expect
something
rich
and
chewy
and
this
is
definitely
more
fullbodied
than
most
lagers
but
its
fairly
light
on
the
tongue
and
its
exceptionally
drinkable
finally
the
hot
summer
nights
have
arrived
in
san
diego
and
this
is
perfect
for
the
occasion
a
dry
well
balanced
and
refreshing
lager
and
obviously
one
that
has
been
perfected
over
a
long
history
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
these
drinkability
you
could
easily
drink
2
or
3
in
one
setting
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
well
balanced
lucky
me
that
picked
up
a
whole
case
when
i
visited
germany
the
other
week
good
beer
i
ordered
this
on
tap
and
was
very
excited
to
try
it
it
cam
in
the
namesake
glass
and
was
quite
impressive
with
a
large
creamy
head
i
had
this
with
some
very
dark
rye
bread
and
butter
it
was
very
dark
and
nutty
with
hints
on
malt
and
coffee
very
nice
feel
and
very
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
think
that
more
than
one
would
be
necessary
wow
i
love
it
very
german
for
such
a
small
abv
i
wouldnt
necessarily
think
this
a
good
beer
but
i
have
had
many
worse
d
not
sure
what
to
think
the
beer
did
not
seem
to
have
much
flavor
the
flavor
that
it
did
have
was
good
but
i
could
not
taste
much
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
so
sorry
köstritzer
low
review
from
me
poured
into
a
pint
glass
an
immense
2
finger
fluffy
beige
head
which
melts
down
to
a
nice
14
inch
deep
dark
amber
brown
substantial
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
nice
marble
effect
like
a
beautiful
abstract
work
of
art
a
little
bubbly
cloud
remains
at
the
top
of
the
beer
until
the
last
drop
though
it
does
not
taste
overly
carbonated
it
is
surprisingly
light
and
not
as
filling
as
it
looks
but
packs
a
pretty
nice
buzz
a
slight
bitterness
of
mild
licorice
with
a
near
perfect
mixture
of
fig
sweetness
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
you
could
easily
and
happily
drink
a
sixer
of
this
brew
this
is
a
yearround
beer
for
every
occasion
and
is
one
of
my
favorites
though
it
is
quite
expensive
and
not
for
the
economic
beer
connoisseur
i
would
say
that
while
i
can
appreciate
the
style
id
like
more
drinkability
to
me
its
rather
harsh
and
onesided
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
for
sure
and
quite
flavorful
for
the
lower
abv
chilled
this
one
slightly
for
the
summer
heat
and
it
went
down
easy
and
enjoyable
no
mystery
why
this
one
is
the
touchstone
for
the
style
one
i
would
have
again
for
sure
served
on
6jul2010
i
like
this
a
lot
im
definitely
going
to
expand
my
horizons
and
start
trying
more
german
beers
now

aroma
is
quite
faint
there
is
some
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
some
burnt
caramel
but
those
come
only
after
let
to
stand
a
while
the
taste
is
a
little
course
which
was
nice
to
allow
the
flavors
to
come
out
a
nice
malty
start
with
some
mild
coffee
and
burnt
grains
and
the
finish
was
a
decent
hop
balance
that
was
left
in
the
after
taste
this
was
a
solid
brew
but
for
the
price
there
are
many
micros
from
the
states
that
are
better

just
tried
it
at
the
local
oktoberfest
on
tap
delicious
d
super
drinkable
and
decent
enjoyment
to
go
with
it
low
carbonation
helps
too
at
least
for
me
not
my
fave
by
a
long
shot
but
much
preferable
to
the
average
session
beer
jd
d
easily
a
session
beer
low
abv
great
flavor
and
a
notsoheavy
body
are
the
reasons
why
i
could
put
away
a
sixer
no
problemo
so
glad
this
one
fell
into
my
lap
for
a
darker
brew
this
goes
down
very
well
im
a
big
fan
and
will
recommend
this
to
friends
this
has
the
lowest
abv
of
any
beer
ive
drank
in
the
past
couple
of
months
so
tossing
a
few
back
would
be
easy
its
not
an
overly
complicated
beer
or
just
extremely
sublte
so
nothing
to
really
perplex
your
taste
buds
would
go
well
with
a
bacon
cheeseburger
the
body
was
good
but
perhaps
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
which
is
fairly
light
to
begin
with
drinkability
was
very
good
having
a
couple
of
these
in
row
would
be
easy
overall
a
nice
little
beer
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
the
mouthfeel
is
better
than
normal
and
with
a
good
drinkability
this
is
beer
to
try
out
every
time
ive
had
kostritzer
ive
liked
it
more
and
more
for
such
a
dark
brew
its
very
sessionable
a
prime
example
of
the
style
the
flavors
follow
the
aromas
and
although
the
munich
malt
character
is
noticeable
the
beer
has
a
clean
lager
characteristics
almost
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
very
quaffable
d
very
sessionable
d
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
with
subtle
aromas
of
coffee
and
smoke
but
do
not
like
the
heaviness
of
irish
stouts
then
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
try
i
will
definitely
be
keeping
a
stock
of
this
in
my
beer
fridge
drinkability
is
quite
good
goes
down
easily
and
refreshing
for
a
dark
beer
d
a
tasty
beer
d
nice
to
drink
tasty
with
light
smooth
feeling
nice
schwarzbier
d
this
is
a
really
approachable
example
of
the
style
the
taste
is
just
complex
enough
to
keep
the
drinker
interested
and
just
smooth
enough
to
go
down
quickly
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
dark
mahogany
with
a
little
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
light
roasted
barley
with
faint
lemon
hops
and
chocolate
and
smoke
it
tasted
like
copper
hops
and
burnt
barley
with
some
bready
yeast
and
lemon
and
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
it
was
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
wasnt
very
clean
or
tasty
with
a
weak
scent
and
mediocre
body
that
all
adds
up
to
a
disappointing
beer
that
i
wouldnt
recommend
unless
youre
desperate
to
try
another
schwarzbier
drinkability
easy
to
drink
this
brew
is
black
but
clear

no
overbearing

very
drinkable

good
with

although
im
rating
this
a
c
i
do
think
its
a
tasty
beer
its
above
average
and
drinkable
but
not
stellar
trying
to
be
realistic
with
my
ratings
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
but
dont
feel
the
need
to
ever
seek
it
out
again
pours

which
is
off

is
also
present
the
aroma
is
a

roasted

a

the
taste
is
of
roasted

a

also
a

the

very
high
the
beer
is
very
very
smooth

easily
goes
down
the
taste
is
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
and
there
is
nothing
to
dislike
about
this
beer
d
if
it
werent
for
the
high
cost
it
is
a
german
import
this
would
be
a
session
brew
that
i
would
buy
by
the
6
pack
for
the
low
abv
this
is
one
brew
that
does
not
disappoint
in
terms
of
flavor
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
notes
very
smooth
light
yet
flavorful
lager
drinkability
is
tops
this
is
a
light
thin
bodied
beer
with
a
ton
of
flavor
d
this
was
an
extremely
quafable
brew
i
could
sit
around
all
evening
drinking
a
6pack
of
this
beer
i
have
to
say
this
my
first
schwarzbier
so
i
really
dont
have
a
true
feel
for
the
style
yet
but
i
really
did
enjoy
this
one
i
definitely
recommend
it
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
one
again
in
the
future
sometime
maybe
not
worth
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
though
for
me
a
black
lager
such
as
this
would
definitely
make
a
great
pickmeup
during
the
summer
or
after
physical
labor
rather
than
a
macro
a
good
lighter
bodied
dark
beer
which
retains
the
roundness
of
flavour
the
appearance
suggests
a
black
lager
that
shows
faint
traces
of
garnet
under
light
a
massive
tan
head
leaves
very
little
lace
behind
but
lasts
a
long
time
it
has
a
clean
aroma
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
grassy
hops
and
a
hint
of
coffee
the
flavour
is
somewhat
malty
giving
a
very
vague
suggestion
of
pumpernickel
bread
theres
also
some
coffee
flavour
but
with
only
a
little
of
the
roasted
bitterness
found
in
a
stout
or
porter
its
noble
hop
character
will
seem
very
familiar
to
any
drinker
of
pilseners
and
other
pale
lagers
light
and
effervescent
this
black
beer
from
germany
will
restore
you
in
the
dead
of
winter
and
refresh
on
the
warmest
and
brightest
of
summer
days
overall
great
beer
though
its
smell
is
not
very
strong
its
taste
is
great
it
is
not
that
heavier
yet
it
delivers
that
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
coffee
like
stouts
or
ports
but
without
the
heavybody
or
strong
finish
yet
there
is
still
flavor
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
full
and
overall
this
beer
was
extremely
drinkable
between
the
surprisingly
low
abv
the
great
taste
and
the
smoothness
d
a
wonderful
session
beer
goes
down
very
very
smooth
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
being
a
perfect
5
in
the
drinkability
department
is
the
slightly
bloating
nature
of
the
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
pleasant
tasty
beer
low
abv
combined
with
its
high
flavor
profile
makes
it
quite
sessionable
as
well
poured
a
smooth
black
color
with
good
carbonaton
and
a
dirty
white
head
nose
is
grains
caramel
and
roasted
malts
black
and
opaque
with
lots
of
malt
and
roasted
qualities
very
drinkable
and
full
of
vibrant
malt
low
abv
keeps
it
very
drinkable
and
cant
belive
the
alcohol
is
low
for
such
full
flavor
overall
a
solid
beer
i
dont
think
this
will
ever
be
my
favourite
style
of
beer
but
considering
its
light
body
and
low
abv
this
stuff
has
a
lot
of
flavour
smooth
and
remarkably
clean
crisp
taste
not
unusual
for
a
german
beer
such
as
this
one
nothing
elaborate
or
extreme
here
drinkable
and
pleasant
drinkability
oh
god
i
could
have
so
many
of
these
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
dream
of
drinking
casually
furthermore
its
only
4
8
abv
this
beer
is
chil
relaxed
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
yet
still
full
of
flavour
and
complexity
im
giving
this
a
perfect
5
because
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
feel
combines
great
tastesmell
and
complexity
with
low
abv
and
an
easy
to
drink
character
everything
is
in
correct
proportion
and
its
a
delightful
experience
d
thirstquenching
and
poundable
d
good
a
slightly
better
than
average
schwarzbier
drinkablity
tasty
schwarzbier
easily
sessionable
and
very
satisfying
i
poured
this
very
nice
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
really
black
as
it
should
be
the
beer
had
a
nice
big
tan
head
that
hung
around
as
it
was
suppose
to
the
beer
also
had
nice
lacing
the
beer
was
bitter
at
the
finish
and
had
a
coffeetoffee
taste
it
was
very
good
and
i
would
buy
again
a
nice
beer
for
the
style
and
very
happy
i
tried
it
worth
the
effort
to
find
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
starts
off
with
a
really
big
head
but
quickly
disolves
into
nothing
soso
lacing
and
at
least
for
me
no
real
aroma
detected
however
this
beer
tasted
great
and
i
am
at
a
loss
on
how
to
describe
the
taste
this
beer
was
the
smoothest
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
was
like
drinking
pure
silk
all
malt
taste
hardly
any
bitterness
at
all
i
guess
this
is
the
black
lager
i
now
compare
all
others
with
drinkability
one
of
the
better
in
the
style
i
have
had
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
for
me
two
in
a
row
would
be
the
most
i
desire
but
i
love
the
lightness
of
this
beer
overall
a
huge
dissapointment
i
figured
a
schwarzbier
from
the
motherland
would
be
bolder
then
this
aparently
america
has
stolen
this
style
away
as
well
shows
a
lean
but
solid
black
with
a
creamy
tan
froth
and
little
to
no
lacing
soft
aromas
of
roasted
grains
chocolate
citrus
coffee
subtle
roasted
nuts
follow
through
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
dry
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
that
absolutely
wows
me
good
not
great
but
good
drinkability
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
and
while
i
will
not
be
drinking
a
six
pack
of
it
anytime
soon
is
indeed
pretty
drinkable
beer
is
super
smooth
beautiful
full
bodied
beer
i
dont
taste
much
roast
at
all
mild
malt
character
no
hops
or
bitterness
to
speak
of
a
perfectly
balanced
simple
tasting
good
beer
for
some
reason
the
first
time
i
ordered
it
i
expected
some
smoke
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
lack
of
it
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
as
high
as
it
gets
while
not
the
finest
brew
it
is
high
quality
and
a
great
benchmark
for
the
schwarzbier
style
not
quite
as
good
after
the
trip
across
the
atlantic
but
still
good
nonetheless
good
dark
dark

huge
germanlight

head
you
only
ge
this
kind
of
head
on
a
german
beer
what
makes
it
look
so
damn
good
is
that
pseudonitro
look
which
beats
any
other
kind
of
pour
smell
is
fine
just
roasted
malts
and
yeast
not
potent
though
especially
at
the
cool
temp
of
7º
c
that
is
recommended
great
taste
incredibly
drinkable
and
a
real
pleasure
to
have
a
whole
keg
to
myself
quite
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
carbonated
a
lighter
body
schwarzbier
with
a
nice
bitterness
pours
is
like
a
nice
german
lager
with
a
off
chocolate
head
nose
of
mild
straw
and
apple
and
maltose
very
lightly
roasted
palate
is
bright
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
a
carbonation
that
constricts
a
bit
and
a
bitterness
of
hop
that
sits
nicely
with
the
hops
good
but
i
expected
bit
more
chocolate
and
dark
qualities
got
as
a
freebie
from
my
uncle
who
dislikes
those
fancy
beers
he
might
have
liked
this
one
schwarzbier
is
one
of
my
favorites
as
it
has
the
drinkability
of
a
session
beer
with
more
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
better
schwarzbiers
ive
had
d
very
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
drink
many
in
a
row
as
the
flavor
would
be
lost
on
you
after
two
excellent
drinkability
refreshing
perfectly
balanced
and
a
fantastic
example
of
style
that
lends
itself
to
being
universally
drinkable
this
is
a
style
i
took
years
coming
back
around
to
i
notice
american
brewers
seem
to
have
a
hard
time
time
duplicating
traditional
versions
of
this
style
although
there
are
great
american
beers
categorized
as
swarzbiers
they
really
have
nothing
in
common
with
beers
like
this
other
than
color
and
bottom
fermentation
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
drinkable
yeah
salright
notes
i
love
schwarzbier
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
has
a
great
pairing
of
flavors
and
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
very
nice
pour
with
exceptional
two
finger
head
dark
appearance
with
a
very
attractive
aroma
of
medium
roasted
coffee
and
caramel
had
this
beer
once
before
and
really
enjoyed
it
bought
it
again
just
recently
just
to
remind
me
how
smooth
this
beer
is
i
could
definitely
have
this
beer
stocked
up
in
the
fridge
not
a
great
beer
imo
this
was
recommended
by
a
friend
i
saw
some
decent
reviews
and
decided
to
try
it
really
really
watery
side
to
it
samuel
adams
black
lager
was
really
so
so
much
better
this
one
had
some
roasted
and
smoke
flavors
behind
the
burnt
malt
flavor
but
the
whole
beer
was
really
thin
and
felt
as
if
everything
needed
to
be
amplified
without
increasing
the
abv
this
beer
dispels
the
misconception
that
dark
beers
are
heavy
because
this
is
anything
but
and
it
also
proves
that
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
a
big
bold
high
octane
highly
hopped
tastebud
bruiser
to
be
good
this
one
is
elegant
in
its
simplicity
i
would
love
to
pair
this
with
bbq
or
a
burger
dark
beer
goes
well
with
them
but
it
is
hard
to
find
ones
that
arent
overly
filling
great
beer
allaround
pours
past
one
finger
head
of
frothy
brown
the
larger
size
of
the
bubbles
makes
it
dissolve
down
swiftly
good
lacing
but
lacking
in
stickiness
pure
black
liquid
albeit
an
amber
glow
appears
around
the
rims
and
glass
bottom
the
liquid
seems
clear
but
hard
to
tell
given
the
blackness
soft
malts
and
toffee
scents
stiffen
from
the
pumpernickel
rye
bread
element
raisin
date
and
fresher
cherry
scents
blend
in
nicely
and
are
sweetened
by
cinnamon
spice
only
the
slightest
roasted
qualities
and
with
minimal
hops
presence
mediumbodied
fine
carbonation
dances
across
the
palate
and
keeps
things
lively
coffee

tightens
up
the

focuses
the
clove

well

the

this
may
have
been
artificially
propped

the
ambiance
of
the
oktoberfest
and
the
interesting
polka
contest
that
was
going
on
while
i
sipped
this
brew
d
fairly
high
due
to
the
somewhat
light
palate
conclusion
tasty
drinkable
black
lager
this
is
a
bit
simple
but
a
nice
dark
german
quaffable
beer
well
done
d
very
drinkable
in
moderation
this
is
the
best
and
the
original
schwarzbier
so
easy
to
drink
it
goes
down
so
nice
id
like
to
have
more
of
this
on
draft
but
not
so
easy
to
find
it
notes
a
really
good
beer
at
peter
lugers
a
really
good
session
beer
with
excellent
drinkability
the
taste
is
superb
an
excellent
blend
light
sweetness
with
a
great
balance
of
bitterness
really
impressed
with
this
brew
picked
a
bottle
up
at
random
and
glad
i
did
ill
be
buying
this
again
in
the
future

liter
mini
keg
the
aroma
is
malty
a
touch
sweet
one
of
my
friends
said
it
smells
like
candy
some
cocoa
notes
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
for
lack
of
a
better
description
the
body
is
light
which
is
totally
appropriate
for
the
style
the
reviews
that
criticize
this
beer
for
being
too
light
bodied
dont
understand
the
style
the
flavor
is
very
good
malt
dominates
caramel
a
touch
of
coffee
and
very
little
in
the
way
of
noticeable
hops
extremely
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
highly
recommended
much
better
then
i
was
expecting
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
refreshing
fairly
light
beer
this
is
worthy
of
a
session
good
enough
stout
schwarzbier
that
pours
like
a
lager
and
had
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
went
down
very
smoothly
but
didnt
finish
too
well
on
my
palate
and
i
thought
it
wasnt
as
good
as
the
other
styles
of
german
beer
i
had
previously
in
the
day
i
would
give
this
another
whack
though
another
happy
find
on
tap
at
the
black

german
restaurant
in
minneapolis
mn
this
cold
mug
is
full
of
opaque
blackbrown
brew
it
shows
a
medium
tan
head
and
modest
streaky
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
subtle
chocolate
apple
malt
not
bad
but
elusive
the
flavor
brings
crisp
apple
wheat
with
light
smokey
malt
and
some
tangy
orange
licorice
rolling
around
at
the
edges
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
relatively
light
bodied
despite
the
appearances
something
a
little
different
and
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
easily
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
that
focuses
on
roasted
malt
very

this
dark
beer
that
sticks
a

to

for
malty
german
beers
in
terms
of
flavor
i
have
had
schwarzbiers
so
infrequently
that
the
mild

was
a
bit
of
a

the
malt
tastes
fresh
and
much
less
like
the

flavor
that
i
expected
from
a
beer
of
this
color
speaking
of

there
are
others
i
would
certainly
choose
over
this

is
an

for
30
seconds
or
so
and
then
becomes
a
nice
coating
throughout
consumption
this
stuff
is
pretty
yummy
and
frothy
smells
of
sweet
choclate
and
spice
can
be
very
drinkable

are
also

with

nicely
balanced
with

becomes
richer
as

the
tidbits
of

that
get
through
displaying
dark

highlights
a
substantial
beige
head
that
breaks
down
relatively
quickly
so
my
judgement
may
be
a
little
skewed

because

slight
burnt
malt
and
caramel
flavor
had
to
deduct
points
for
it
has
a
slight
metallic
ring
on
my
palate
this
is
a
nono
sweet
on
the
nose
a
mellow
and
enjoyable
drink
very
mild
with
subdued
roasted
malt
aroma
and
flavor
aroma
was
slighty
metallic
and
there
was
a
trace
of
metal
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
it
was
not
prominent
not
particularly
impressive
a
very
good
schwarzbier
o
very
impressive
with
a
lot
of
complexity
and
flavor
without
being
a
heavy
hitting
beer
definitely
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
this
bottle
may
very
well
have
been
a
bit
old
but
the
beer
was
still
quite
drinkable
downed
it
relatively
swiftly
would
love
to
try
this
fresher
or
on
tap
its
been
years
since
ive
had
something
from
einbecker
so
im
interested
to
see
how
my
feelings
have
evolved
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
smoky
topaz
topped
by
a
finger
of
charred
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
roast
light
toast
and
a
touch
of
cashew
the
taste
intensifies
the
roast
a
bit
and
replaces
the
cashew
with
a
bit
of
rubber
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
an
odd
little
schwarz
really
the
rubber
character
is
pretty
offputting
but
the
rest
seems
to
finish
rather
cleanly
i
have
no
idea
how
old
this
bottle
isw
so
perhaps
age
has
had
an
effect
but
it
seems
fresh
enough
just
lackluster
nice
beer
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
nice
dunkel
german
beers
i
enjoy
one
of
these
after
a
hot
day
of
riding
steam
trains
this
beer
on
has
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
for
me
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
hops
to
dark
malt
something
that
is
not
easily
accomplished
if
served
cold
it
has
a
wonderful
head
and
one
of
the
nicest
aromas
of
the
dunkel
beers
interesting
and
one
of
the
better
german
brewed
dunkels
ive
had
so
far
this
schwarzbier
is
a
darkred
color
transparent
with
a
slightly
tanned
neck
the
aroma
emanates
caramelly
malt
tones
with
vigor
with
noble
hopes
in
the
background
the
taste
displays
medium
carbonation
the
same
caramel
and
coffee
tones
the
sensation
is
very
refreshing
and
very
soft
and
the
taste
is
super
fast
the
beer
slides
fast
in
the
palate
the
aftertaste
is
malty
and
shows
noble
hops
definitely
a
good
pick
for
the
end
of
winter
whatever
style
it
is
its
another
awesome
brew
from
einbecker
einbecker
i
wont
buy
another
one
of
your
beers
until
i
see
it
in
a
brown
bottle
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
out
again
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
resulting
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
creamy
or
fizzy
closes
out
dry
with
little
stickiness
across
the
palate
pours
a
slightly
murky
dark
brown
with
a
12
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roastedtoasted
malt
and
some
slight
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
but
slightly
watery
there
is
a
very
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
smell
but
the
flavors
are
pretty
thin
in
my
opinion
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
with
the
lower
abv
and
not
too
intense
flavor
this
beer
is
easily
sessionable
and
definitely
one
that
i
would
try
again
rjt
pours
a
nice
clear
cocacola
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
finebubbled
and
rather
persistent
pale
tan
head
strong
malty
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
pear
and
is
on
the
sweet
side
flavor
has
a
malty
core
and
tones
of
caramel
licorice
and
fruit
and
a
hint
of
grass
smooth
texture
has
a
decent
amount
of
fizz
and
about
average
body
overall
not
outstanding
but
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
definitely
repeatable
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
but
not
great
schwarzbier
its
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
thats
a
minor
point
it
provides
a
good
price
to
value
profile
and
id
buy
it
again
particularly
for
a
long
night
of
beer
and
conversation
with
friends
feels
like
liquid
bread
crust
not
crunchy
or
rough
just
firm
and
a
medium
to
low
dryness
light
carbonation
overall
more
of
a
bock
rather
than
a
schwartz
this
beer
is
boring
and
forgettable
upon
letting
this
one
sit
for
a
while
to
warm
i
found
that
the
flavors
did
develop
nicely
and
there
was
a
bit
of
a
caramel
malt
that
came
out
and
gave
this
some
character
still
not
my
favorite
but
not
too
bad
afterall
o
i
couldnt
drink
this
all
day
long
and
wish
adjunct
macro
lagers
were
of
the
same
calibre
i
also
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
have
tried
this
beer
otherwise
spend
your
money
elsewhere
d
super
high
drinkability
quite
refreshing
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
pale
and
fruity
for
a
schwartz
more
properly
called
a
dunkel
light
smooth
lots
of
vienna
just
enough
going
on
but
drinkable
over
challenging
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
schwarzbier
but
a
good
one
though
overy
drinkable
an
interesting
style
since
it
has
quite
a
bit
of
aroma
but
a
much
more
faint
taste
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
plenty
of
carbonation
to
go
around
the
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
even
it
does
drink
like
something
at
a
higher
abv
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
good
flavorful
schwarzbier
overall
more
of
a
dunkel
than
a
schwarz
this
one
is
a
bit
watery
and
insipid
perhaps
it
was
a
bit
old
as
other
bas
have
reported
a
hoppier
profile
than
what
i
tasted
this
is
one
of
the
best
schwarzbiers
that
i
have
had
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
o
a
good
choice
for
a
dunkel
this
beer
isnt
what
i
expected
from
a
schwarzbier
but
it
is
still
a
great
choice
if
you
like
darker
beers
with
the
drinkability
and
body
of
a
session
beer
drinkability
a
thumbs
up
though
i
like
my
dark
beers
thick
and
creamy
the
light
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
does
not
take
away
from
the
bolder
darker
flavors
d
a
good
brew
very
easy
to
drink
at
the
sessionable
abv
and
the
light
body
makes
it
even
more
so
d
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
with
little
to
no
alcohol
taste
present
d
do
not
drink
this
beer
cold
room
temperature
only
recommended
for
all
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
medium
fizzy
head
aroma
is
caramel
and
cereal
malts
taste
is
heavy
on
the
roast
grains
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
nuts
flavors
then
move
into
a
slight
grassy
hops
into
the
finishing
the
beer
is
pretty
lightbodied
for
a
dunkel
almost
watery
not
terribly
remarkable
but
a
decent
speciman
o
a
pleasant
fruity
schwartzbier
with
interersting
smoky
overtones
note
it
might
be
better
to
call
this
a
dunkel
under
that
sort
i
would
say
its
the
best
in
the
world
tastes
like
slightly
overtoasted
bread
theres
a
mild
grainy
bitterness
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
raisin
the
body
is
appropriately
light
but
not
as
thin
as
something
like
kostritzer
finishes
with
a
mild
bitter
bite
enjoyable
stuff
not
particularly
outstanding
but
good
drink
well
my
friends
almost
crispbodied
with
sensible
nutty
malt
flavor
plenty
of
hops
all
around
though
youd
think
a
black
beer
would
be
less
hop
forward
but
theyre
very
significant
spicy
flavor
from
them
with
a
spicy
and
floral
aroma
more
bready
in
the
flavoring
bitterness
is
mild
though
not
entirely
absent
just
mild
it
could
probably
stand
augmentation
but
hardly
necessary
yum
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
finishes
moderately
dry
its
light
in
body
and
has
minimal
carbonation
on
the
palate
the
dry
finish
reveals
a
slight
bitterness
from
grains
and
the
forward
is
all
plisen
sweetness
its
appropriately
restrained
and
not
overbearing
really
drinkable
i
like
einbecker
d
an
ok
beer
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
pretty
meh
beer
i
found
most
the
flavors
pretty
lacking
and
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
bad
too
bad
the
appearance
is
brown
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
faint
with
toasted
caramel
malt
chocolate
and
a
touch
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
its
not
as
good
its
more
acidic
and
astringent
the
palate
is
thin
but
decently
carbonated
the
beer
isnt
that
great
overall
but
its
ok
to
drink
its
one
id
have
again
but
its
not
one
id
search
out
it
would
depend
on
whats
available
drinkability
is
good
not
overly
impressed
but
nothing
offensive
enough
to
detract
from
the
drinkability
cola
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
butterscotch
taste
is
butterscotchcaramel
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
flavorful
and
refreshing
goes
down
nicely
i
would
definetly
recommend
and
i
can
see
myself
buying
this
again
in
the
near
future
good
job
by
einbecker
brauhaus
d
i
thought
it
was
a
lot
more
drinkable
when
i
started
on
the
glass
it
was
colder
then
so
yeah
very
drinkable
at
temp
drink
easy
to
drink
very
light
great
smell
but
the
taste
was
a
little
lacking
for
me
overall
a
decent
schwarz
but
a
little
bit
too
mild
imo
it
is
nice
to
see
this
end
of
the
spectrum
though
less
roasty
and
more
lagery
a
decent
session
beer
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
d
drinkable
one
of
the
better
schwarzbiers
ive
tried
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
medium
drinkability
is
good
probably
the
best
quality
of
the
beer
pretty
solid
beer
like
all
schwartzbiers
and
dunkels
it
is
at
the
height
of
beer
drinkability
but
i
would
take
a
koestritzer
over
this
d
the
ultimate
in
chugability
i
really
like
this
one
aside
from
the
name
not
quite
being
true
this
one
pours
to
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
about
13
of
an
inch
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
it
has
a
sweet
character
there
is
a
bit
of
barley
malt
character
it
has
a
smooth
clean
finish
pours
a
clear
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
small
tight
eggshell
colored
head
which
settles
into
a
light
cap
quite
light
for
a
black
beer
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
roasted
munich
malt
quite
doughy
and
sweet
some
grassy
peppery
notes
as
well
the
taste
has
a
nice
but
very
light
roasted
quality
which
rides
shotgun
to
a
big
munich
malt
presence
big
doughy
flavor
with
some
caramel
raisin
and
grassypeppery
notes
tastes
more
like
a
dunkel
than
schwarzbier
moderate
feel
with
tingly
carbonation
lightly
sweet
it
may
not
be
the
best
tasting
schwarzbier
out
there
but
it
has
good
flavors
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
low
abv
is
nice
more
of
a
dunkel
but
a
good
dunkel
d
this
is
a
an
average
representation
of
the
style
and
goes
down
easily

im

interestingly
i
think
this
smells
similarly
to
an
american
ambermore
malty
with
light
crystal
malt
than
bitter
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
dunkel
to
me
the
flavor
does
revert
to
style
with
stronger
darker
malts
coming
through
on
the
tongue
it
also
has
the
warming
characteristics
of
a
much
higher
alcohol
beer
the
body
is
light
as
expected
the
aftertaste
is
bland
but
wellbalanced
the
taste
is
quite
clean
some
roasted

malts
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
to
balance
out
the
deep
roasts
there
is
a
touch
of
some
chocolate
in
the
beer
there
might
be
a
slightly
nutty
slightly
fruity
quality
in
there
underneath
the
beer
is
just
right
in
its
consistency
not
too
creamy
not
too
prickly
the
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
are
quite
nice
this
is
a
fairly
light
bodied
beer
once
it
settles
in
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
lchaim
overall
a
number
of
things
in
this
one
check
and
balance
drinkability
lighter
body
makes
this
one
go
down
easy
lighter
flavors
make
it
a
quicker
drink
but
not
necessarily
a
better
one
and
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
an
orphan
bottle
a
single
outside
of
the
six
they
sell
singles
at
this
store
but
i
wont
break
the
cardboard
encapsulated
style
apart
to
get
one
just
not
cool
in
my
opinion
but
luckily
someone
else
did
but

a

i
doubt
id
be
reaching
for
23
of
these
anytime
soon
better
reps
of
the
style
out
there
this
is
not
horrible
but
just
ok
still
worth
a
try
d
i
think
its
a
little
too
subdued
to
be
called
a
schwarzbier
though
it
is
easily
drinkable

this
beer
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
singlefinger
head
the
smell
is
filled
with
candylike
malt
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
little
hit
of
hops
that
gives
way
to
some
roasted
carameltasting
malt
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
slightly
thick
without
a
ton
of
carbonation
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
also
fairly
a
drinkable
a
great
choice
that
everyone
whos
interested
in
the
style
should
try
i
know
some
folks
have
dismissed
this
beer
schwarzbiers
in
general
but
i
lovem
einbecker
is
no
exception
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
with
a
couple
porters
had
a
fine
and
tasty
night
the
pork
chop
dinner
certainly
helped
the
11
2
oz
bottle
poured
an
amberhoney
color
at
first
with
a
nice
beige
head
and
lotsa
lacyness
a
smoky
honey
and
malt
aroma
and
taste
with
a
mild
silky
feel
to
it
give
me
more
d
the
beer
drinks
very
smooth
has
a
very
good
grain
bill
per
style
as
well
bitterness
and
perhaps
one
of
the
better
schwarzbiers
i
have
probably
ever
tasted
a
dark
roasted
bittersweet
treat
definitely
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
fine
session
beer
with
the
abv
being
at
4
90
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
at
one
sitting
but
seeing
how
plainjane
this
is
i
doubt
thats
gonna
happen
anytime
soon
a
good
bock
or
dopplebock
would
be
a
better
warm
weather
choice
than
this
and
if
ya
want
a
dark
beer
just
go
all
out
and
get
a
rogue
or
stone
bomber
this
is
worth
a
shot
once
if
for
no
other
reason
to
say
that
youve
had
a
german
schwarzbier
draught
this
one
poured
an
extremely
dark
copper
color
it
seemed
fairly
clear
and
only
had
a
very
small
tan
head
on
it
the
aroma
was
decent
although
a
little
light
there
were
caramel
notes
as
well
as
a
faint
tinge
of
roastiness
the
taste
was
good
it
was
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
taste
very
subdued
notes
of
caramel
and
dark
fruits
not
bad
drinkability
im
thinking
i
got
a
bad
bottle
because
this
is
reminding
me
nothing
of
the
rest
of
the
reviews
i
will
need
to
try
another
bottle
of
this
to
make
sure
but
its
not
a
keeper
based
on
this
one
bottle
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
cherry
aftertaste
but
not
so
much
that
i
wouldnt
try
again
pours
a
transparent
burnt
copper
with
a
tall
light
brown
head
that
retained
well
leaving
some
very
light
lace
as
it
slowly
fades
away
the
nose
smells
like
dark
sodaslightly
sweet
with
some
faint
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
noticable
hoppage
this
schwarzbier
is
loaded
with
caramelsweeter
than
im
used
tonot
badand
quite
enjoyable
an
underlying
nuttiness
and
very
obviously
hoppy
finish
bring
this
back
within
the
realm
of
the
style
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
and
the
mouthfeel
it
quite
creamy
and
soft
this
is
a
very
drinkable
schwarzbier
as
are
mostprobably
the
best
green
bottle
ive
had
in
recent
memory
overall
this
schwarzbier
didnt
have
much
in
the
flavor
department
but
it
was
easy
to
drink

in

pours
a
dark
copper
brown
with
rubyred
highlights
and
a
thin
light
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
caramel
with
coffee
and
chocolate
playing
strong
supporting
roles
tastes
very
roasty
with
chocolate
and
coffee
at
the
fore
caramel
and
hints
of
continental
hops
are
also
present
flavors
are
a
bit
more
subtle
than
expected
but
mesh
rather
well
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
not
the
most
robust
schwarzbier
ive
tried
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
its
tasty
and
very
drinkable
a
solid
schwarzbier
very
disappointed
drinkability
is
high
for
me
if
i
could
find
a
6
pack
or
anything
id
be
sure
to
get
more
pours
a
clear

roast
even
more
subtle
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
on
the
palate
things
taste
old
i
get
some
medium
toasty
malt
flavors
a
firm
finishing
bitterness
but
overall
smooth
and
very
dry
this
has
got
to
be
a
really
old
bottle
i
dont
suspect
oxidation
it
just
tastes
old
poured
a
33cl
bottle
into
my
valdieu
goblet
poured
a
dark
cherry
brown
the
red
really
shows
through
when
its
held
to
the
light
there
was
very
little
head
with
a
hard
pour
and
it
left
no
lacing
whatsoever
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
there
is
definite
notes
of
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
taste
is
creamy
up
front
with
the
roasted
malts
coming
out
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thinner
for
the
style
and
finishes
slightly
dry
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
my
first
exposure
to
a
schwarzbier
a
good
beer
that
just
surprises
with
its
milder
flavors
smells
and
abv
considering
its
appearance
i
knew
what
to
expect
and
still
i
was
surprise
a
great
beer
for
when
you
want
multiple
darks
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
rare
vos
glass
it
pours
a
cola
brown
with
a
great
1
12
inch
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
foam
i
smell
pilsner
hops
toasted
malts
and
caramel
undertones
the
flavor
is
great
nice
and
toasty
with
a
light
body
and
creamy
body
the
malty
body
is
delicately
balanced
with
the
slightly
skunky
hop
flavor
the
carbonation
is
noticeable
and
it
adds
a
little
bit
of
dryness
and
spice
to
the
drink
at
4
9
abv
this
is
plenty
sessionable
i
love
a
good
schwazbier
its
also
a
good
thing
to
spring
on
a
newer
craft
beer
trier
that
doesnt
do
dark
beer
because
it
is
so
light
and
well
balanced
einbecker
schwarzbier
pours
a
dark
brown
that
on
closer
inspection
appears
to
be
a
dark
ruby
red
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
green
11
2
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
the
flavor
is
dark
malty
goodness
theres
nothing
flashy
about
this
beer
but
its
a
solid
easy
drinking
lager
sessionable
poured
from
a
green
bottle
sigh
looking
dark
brown
clear
and
with
head
retention
the
aroma
is
roasted
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
sulfur
the
flavor
starts
with
dark
roasted
malts
not
burnt
but
theres
a
slight
coffee
note
in
the
aftertaste
theres
a
little
bit
of
grassy
hops
there
as
well
but
its
a
bit
bland
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
just
a
touch
on
the
heavy
side
wellbalanced
with
high
carbonation
overall
theres
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
a
little
sweet
btu
good
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
adjuncts
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
caramel
to
be
honest
it
tasted
like
your
generic
euro
lager
think
becks
in
dark
form
no
thanks
im
a
big
fan
of
schwarzbiers
but
this
one
was
a
let
down
mouthfeel
was
light
and
carbonated
this
could
be
a
session
beer
if
you
wanted
it
to
be
but
to
be
honest
i
was
good
with
one
wouldnt
go
back
to
this
one
weak
and
small
head
pours
dark
brown
malty
and
almost
pilsner
aroma
i
found
that
this
is
good
meal
beer
because
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
carbonation
probably
better
labeled
as
a
dark
pilsner
as
opposed
to
a
traditional
schwarzbier
serve
colder
to
get
a
better
woody
smoky
flavor
brew
poured
to
a
brown
color
but
your
able
to
see
through
it
has
a
medium
sized
light
tan
head
that
had
very
limited
retention
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
seems
to
be
pretty
good
nice
strong
malt
scent
that
gives
off
the
idea
of
caramel
also
giving
a
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
a
letdown
imo
the
malt
scent
does
not
carry
over
to
the
taste
seems
very
watery
what
is
there
reminds
me
a
bit
of
caramel
but
also
finishes
a
little
odd
has
a
sweet
flavor
and
has
a
slight
hop
ending
this
brew
was
a
let
down
i
enjoy
schwarzbier
very
much
but
imo
this
just
did
not
meet
the
cut
i
feel
that
there
are
many
other
offerings
that
are
much
better
than
this
one
pours
a
clear
but
dark
ruby
with
no
head
nose
is
very
slightly
smoked
it
seems
very
minute
malt
character
there
too
overall
it
seems
to
be
very
subdued
on
the
nose
flavor
is
a
bit
meaty
with
a
slight
woody
inky
edge
to
it
feel
has
a
nice
bubble
to
it
though
i
feel
like
there
is
a
thick
ink
character
in
this
one
that
stays
on
my
tongue
feels
kind
of
odd
drinkability
is
good
it
is
a
smooth
brew
with
some
unusual
characteristics
from
the
style
but
overall
it
is
no
homerun
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
not
much
head
then
nothing
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sparse
mineral
infused
a
faint
caramel
nothing
much
else
the
taste
is
a
speck
better
good
bitterness
but
really
needs
more
carbonation
and
body
to
hold
up
any
flavors
that
might
be
there
forgettable
drinkability
is
probably
about
average
i
didnt
really
want
to
finish
mine
but
i
did
i
imagine
that
fans
of
the
style
may
be
more
inclined
to
enjoy
it
personally
i
thought
it
tasted
like
a
more
expensive
version
of
negro
modelo
but
that
might
just
be
me
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
smooth
carbonation
interesting
step
out
of
the
ordinary
for
me
drinkability
very
enjoyable
although
not
the
best
schwarzbier
ive
had
i
love
einbeckers
but
this
was
my
least
favorite
not
bad
by
any
means
hardly
spectacular
very
drinkable
good
schwarzbier
its
dark
and
drinkably
mild
drinkers
who
like
sweet
and
smokey
brews
will
not
be
dissapointed
by
this
one
it
is
complex
and
unique
to
the
style
which
makes
it
a
worthy
try
for
any
fan
of
beer
well
i
wasnt
expecting
this
beer
to
have
a
skunky
hop
characteristic
so
i
am
left
to
assume
that
the
single
green
bottles
under
the
fluorescent
lights
at
the
shop
are
the
culprit
drinkability
good
beer
with
gust
not
thrilled
with
this
one
something
about
it
is
drinkable
but
the
aroma
and
taste
need
a
boost
drinks
easy
but
offstyle
to
be
sure
this
brewery
didnt
impress
in
germany
still
doesnt
here
opinion
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
i
really
like
the
malt
presence
i
like
all
of
the
beers
from
this
brewery
and
i
certainly
wasnt
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
would
drink
this
beer
and
many
others
from
this
brewery
if
they
were
available
regularly
in
my
area
for
now
i
will
just
savor
the
few
bottles
that
i
brought
back
from
missouri
of
the
schwarzbiers
out
there
this
one
is
my
favorite
and
i
found
a
fairly
fresh
kept
in
a
coolerbeer
cave
batch
at
shawan
liquors
recently
rich
roasted
flavor
without
the
smokiness
you
sometimes
get
and
no
green
bottle
skunk
or
off
flavors
this
time
really
enjoyed
it
good
beer
drinkability
i
have
been
on
a
darker
lager
kick
lately
and
this
one
gives
me
reasont
o
keep
checking
them
out
great
flavor
reasonable
abv
a
good
candidate
for
a
few
more
pours
nearly
black
with
hints
of
reddish
brown
at
the
edges
with
a
huge
3
finger
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
sticky
lacing
smells
of
nice
dark
roasted
malts
and
some
molasses
taste
is
predominantly
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
some
molasses
and
what
seemed
like
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
at
the
finish
good
mouthfeel
nice
light
body
seems
to
fit
well
with
the
style
good
drinkability
very
enjoyable
this
isnt
really
roasted
in
any
way
which
leads
me
to
think
this
is
more
of
a
bavarian
dunkel
than
a
schwarzbier
in
fact
this
is
only
labeled
schwarzbier
in
america
lets
just
say
its
a
good
easily
drinkable
german
dark
lager
of
sorts
d
tasty
not
very
filling
very
easy
to
drink
certainly
poundable
due
to
the
low
abv
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
my
favorite
within
the
style
overall
a
very
nice
and
quaffable
schwarzbier
i
am
convinced
that
this
is
perhaps
the
most
underated
beer
style
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
amber
hues
around
the
edges
the
head
is
solid
tannishwhite
and
long
lasting
the
aroma
is
of
a
generic
dark
lager
caramel
malt
is
nice
but
the
is
nothing
special
about
this
beers
aroma
this
taste
is
a
mirror
image
of
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
so
much
so
that
it
is
annoying
and
certainly
takes
away
from
the
taste
overall
this
beer
is
a
major
disappointment
and
im
not
even
sure
if
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
were
free
pour
is
a
nearly
opaque
black
with
a
garnet
tint
where
the
light
barely
creeps
through
smell
is
very
mild
roasted
malt
not
too
easy
to
pick
up
on
taste
is
clean
and
smooth
again
hitting
the
roasty
note
very
easy
to
drink
23
and
not
blink
an
eye
not
a
bad
schwarzbier
in
my
book
fairly
drinkable
in
the
right
conditions
if
youre
just
drinking
the
taste
gets
old
but
if
youre
eating
a
steak
dinner
its
very
drinkable
the
drinkability
is
also
very
good
a
very
fine
example
of
this
style
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
looks
good
from
the
pour
a
brown
with
ruby
hues
a
thick
peachy
brown
colored
head
that
sits
nicely
in
an
oversized
pilsner
glass
smells
is
german
slight
alocohol
sweet
malts
and
that
mild
earthy
hop
aroma
nothing
special
and
for
the
taste
again
nothing
staggering
mostly
pale
with
a
little
sweet
malts
by
the
color
id
have
guess
differently
than
im
percieving
in
taste
bit
darker
in
the
finish
but
mostly
hifi
and
watery
bland
and
rather
bright
for
a
dark
beer
the
aftertaste
lingers
with
the
dry
unsweetened
cocoa
note
and
sime
residual
hop
spice
this
saves
it
from
being
swill
motuhfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
just
fine
i
wouldnt
borther
drinking
this
again
i
was
searching
for
an
imported
schwarz
to
get
better
aligned
with
the
style
without
knowing
what
to
pick
and
grabbed
this
one
because
it
was
there
but
it
seems
this
may
not
have
been
the
best
pick
for
now
tastewise
i
prefer
sa
dark
lager
a
really
good
schwarzbier
imo
good
beer
that
is
often
overlooked
great
for
those
times
when
you
want
a
flavorful
but
soft
and
delicate
beer
that
is
not
overly
sweet
or
heavy
very
stoutlike
in
its
toasted
roasted
flavors
but
dunkellike
in
the
texture
and
cleanliness
looks
well
black
without
looking
viscous
has
a
very
roasty
flavor
with
a
light
grape
and
licorice
notes
very
clean
flavor
and
well
brewed
a
dry
stout
charcoal
finish
crisp
and
abrupt
good
beer
with
only
a
light
malt
sweetness
to
balance
poured
transparent
dark
brown
with
small
white
head
that
disappeared
very
quickly
decent
lace
smells
predominantly
of
caramel
with
toasted
bread
notes
and
leafy
hops
flavor
is
quite
weak
clean
but
thin
and
watery
toasted
malts
with
a
slightly
drier
leafy
finish
a
touch
of
unpleasant
diacetyl
aftertaste
thin
body
up
front
develops
some
oily
creaminess
towards
the
finish
poured
a
deepreddish
brown
color
with
modeerate
tannish
head
nice
lacing
smell
is
a
mixture
of
molasses
brown
sugar
toasted
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
similiar
to
the
smell
but
after
several
tastes
it
slowly
dissappears
finished
with
a
somewhat
thin
feeling
in
the
mouth
with
little
if
any
body
easy
drinking
but
rather
bland
drinkability
this
beer
has
session
written
all
over
it
im
just
glad
that
since
it
was
in
a
green
bottle
and
sitting
on
the
shelf
in
the
light
that
it
wasnt
skunked
the
taste
is
only
lightly
sweet
with
a
smooth
roast
character
to
it
the
beer
rests
lightly
on
the
palate
for
the
most
part
there
is
a
touch
of
lingering
heft
to
it
and
the
body
itself
has
a
medium
fullness
to
it
malt
is
definitely
the
focus
in
this
beer
there
is
almost
a
nutty
character
to
this
brew
similar
to
what
is
found
in
some
brown
ales
and
the
finish
has
a
light
coffee
like
roast
character
to
it
this
beer
has
the
malt
character
i
would
associate
with
a
dunkel
beer
despite
this
the
beer
is
quite
tasty
drinkability
not
a
favorite
of
mine
wont
return
to
it
not
horrible
but
it
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
this
is
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
is
interesting
and
fairly
tasty
although
its
shortcomings
in
appearance
and
smell
hurt
the
drinkability
a
bit
an
intriquing
selection
i
wont
look
for
this
beer
again
but
i
would
give
the
brewer
another
shot
because
this
example
shows
some
craft
brewing
chops
mouthfeel
pretty
light
and
a
lot
of
great
carbonation
that
really
lifts
up
malts
well
and
really
makes
this
beer
so
easy
to
drink
its
not
even
gasey
at
least
as
any
beer
can
be
einbeckers
version
is
a
valid
one
although
i
find
myself
wishing
for
more
of
pretty
much
everything
the
11
2
ounces
disappeared
in
a
flash
so
i
must
have
found
something
to
like
this
one
is
worth
a
look
if
youre
a
schwarzbier
aficionado
probably
not
if
youre
not
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
good
beer
from
a
brewery
that
has
consistently
managed
to
make
superb
german
lagers
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
with
a
great
roasty
malty
flavor
highly
recommended
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
beer
maybe
because
i
adore
their
maibock
so
much
dont
get
me
wrong
the
craftsmanship
and
construction
of
this
lager
is
topnotch
i
was
just
left
wanting
more
a
good
beer
to
introduce
newbies
into
dark
beer
territory
overall
nothing
outstanding
a
soso
schwarzbier
that
was
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
burnt
sugar
and
molasses
for
my
taste
light
to
medium
bodied
easily
drinkable
this
is
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
pours
a
dark
clear
reddish
brown
big
loose
head
forms
but
leaves
just
as
quick
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
beer
is
rather
dull
smells
like
iron
roasted
malt
sweet
also
a
dark
fruit
smell
tastes
sweet
with
some
light
roast
flavour
and
dark
fruits
also
an
iron
flavour
in
there
body
is
pretty
light
very
low
carbonation
tastes
like
a
weak
doppelbock
not
so
good
looks
almost
black
in
low
light
but
some
maroon
coloring
is
seen
when
held
to
light
creamy
tan

abot
12
then
fades
slowly
to
a
14
smell
is
light
grassy
malt
and
some
roasted
malt
slightly
buttery
taste
is
dominated
by
grassy
malts
some
burnt
flavors
about
what
youd
expect
from
the
style
decent
hops
finish
lingers
with
the
burnt
tones
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
pretty
good
beer
while
im
not
impressed
this
would
be
a
good
choice
for
someone
who
is
starting
to
drink
nonmacros
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
towering
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
roasted
crystal
malt
scent
that
is
sweet
and
slightly
dry
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
thin
and
light
crystal
malt
flavor
that
seems
a
bit
watered
down
and
weak
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
average
as
well
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
beer
has
good
aroma
but
its
really
weak
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
it
drinks
easy
but
its
one
and
done
for
me
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
little
lace
smells
somewhat
like
granny
smith
apples
with
a
slight
noble
hop
aroma
taste
is
dry
crisp
but
somewhat
metallic
good
malt
backbone
but
very
slight
to
no
roasted
flavor
if
eyes
are
closed
tastes
more
like
a
märzen
than
anything
else
overall
id
say
its
slightly
above
average
it
poured
with
a
tannish
somewhat
creamy
head
and
a
very
deep
auburn
but
not
quite
opaque
body
the
nose
is
chocolatey
roast
malt
a
full
figured
mouthfeel
amazingly
quite
smooth
the
chocolate
malt
is
prevalent
and
i
am
surprised
at
how
subdued
the
roasted
aspect
is
a
little
underwhelming
actually
the
finish
is
somewhat
creamy
with
some
bitterness
that
accompanies
a
fading
chocolate
note
its
ok
not
outstanding
frankly
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
smokiness
or
at
least
roastiness
drinkability

this
is
a
good
solid
entry
into
the
black
beer
market
addendum
smells
a
bit
like
old
tree
bark
and
leather
clearly
sepia
beautiful
transluscence
with
a
healthy
froth
the
lace

down

a

more
of

red
than
black
with
a
one
finger
head
that
settled
into
a
thin
layer
coating
the
top
of
the
beernice
subtle
complexities
in
the
aroma
i
got
some
buttery
notes
as
some
caramel
and
even
a
touch
of
iron
taste
has
almost
a
spiced
coffee
cake
flavor
to
it
some
baking
spice
and
brown
sugar
are
big
with
some
coffee
thrown
in
a
nice
brew
here
not
overly
complex

there
some

even
with
the

1
90
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
very
drinkable
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
kostrizer
schwarzbier
in
flavor
or
smell
nor
was
it
a
compelling
as
either
the
urbock
or
maiurbock
from
this
brewery
a
shameful
excuse
for
a
schwarzbier
a
very
nice
and
mellow
beer
i
can
see
how
some
might
be
disappointed
with
it
due
to
the
lighter
than
expected
flavor
but
what
is
present
here
is
quite
pleasing
if
in
a
quaffing
mood
this
might
be
one
of
the
easiest
dark
beers
to
chug
i
can
imagine
pairing
this
with
a
roast
beef
on
dark
pumpernickel
sandwich
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
especially
if
youve
yet
to
have
a
schwarzbier
overall
id
have
to
say
that
the
appearance
smell
and
taste
were
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
the
moment
i
saw
this
brew
on
the
shelf
quite
impressed
indeed
and
will
most
certainly
buy
again
mediumfull
feel
a
bit
plain
not
something
id
go
for
often
taste
is
caramel
malt
roasted
grain
and
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
this
one
seems
to
become
thinner
in
body
as
it
warms
slight
hops
bitterness
at
the
finish
evens
out
the
sweet
malt
profile
enough
to
earn
nice
marks
for
drinkability
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
tan
head
that
lasts
it
has
a
malty
licorice
aroma
the
body
is
light
but
it
is
very
flavorful
there
is
some
chocolate
and
raisin
notes
with
a
slight
spice
it
finishes
crisp
and
dry
with
some
delicate
noble
hops
a
good
starting
point
for
those
shy
about
dark
beers
because
it
is
so
light
in
body
dark
brown
pour
with
some
reddish
light
transmission
nice
head
of
12
an
inch
of
rising
foam
and
with
excellent
lacing
properties
smell
of
light
nutiness
malty
sweetness
and
just
a
touch
of
grape
the
mouthfeel
is
shy
of
medium
but
with
a
sharpness
lent
by
fresh
and
grassy
hoppiness
that
reminds
me
of
its
mai
bock
cousin
and
a
beer
ive
had
a
soft
spot
for
biscuity
and
honeyish
malts
compete
early
but
the
attenuation
is
very
nice
and
the
beer
dries
to
a
satisfying
finish
wellbalanced
and
more
interesting
than
some
other
schwarzbiers
slightly
skeletal
in
body
but
with
an
added
complexity
this
beer
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
has
a
great
taste
this
is
a
top
pick
of
the
style
for
me
i
didnt
have
real
high
aspirations
for
this
beer
as
i
have
been
unimpressed
by
the
style
in
the
past
maybe
its
because
i
had
this
after
a
couple
of
pilsners
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
particularly
the
taste
this
is
to
celebrator
what
blanche
de
chambly
is
to
la
fin
du
monde
nice
chocolate
malt
flavor
smooth
and
tasty
somewhat
thin
and
watery
and
ultimately
inconsequential
nonetheless
a
nice
beer

liked

a
roasted
quality
that
arent
withstanding
some
length
or
boldness
not
that
its
really
all
that
necessary
for
the
style
but
it
seems
to
be
over
quickly
theres
some
nice
subtlities
to
the
roastyness
with
toffee

that
help
keep

the

a

beer
the

care
for
i
could
not
drink
many
of
these
back
to
back
maybe
after
repeated
exposure
i
will
adjust
to
the
dryness
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
moderately
large
rocky
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
sweet
roasted
malt
the
tastemouthfeel
was
moderate
to
thin
with
a
sharp
effervescence
and
little
of
the
maltiness
that
was
promised
by
the
aroma
and
very
little
aftertaste
i
thought
i
had
a
great
beer
from
the
aroma
but
was
sadly
dissapointed
at
the
flavor
what
was
there
wasnt
bad
but
there
just
wasnt
enough
of
it
an
excellent
dunkel
ive
never
tried
anything
by
this
brewery
so
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
very
clean
flavors
with
an
excellent
smooth
malt
profile
this
was
one
pretty
looking
beer
deep
brown
in
color
with
lots
of
colorful
highlights
shining
through
taste
was
very
even
and
went
down
really
well
flavors
came
at
me
with
a
sharp
crispness
toasted
malts
were
there
caramel
malt
flavor
followed
a
roasted
bitterness
came
through
after
that
dark
fruit
taste
was
in
the
mix
also
well
balanced
and
well
crafted
named
einbecker
dunkel
in
europe
allegedly
the
same
beer
the
schwarzbier
label
is
supposed
to
look
trendier
in
the
us
and
its
definitely
a
dunkel
not
a
schwarzbier
reddish
brown
colour
bread
yeast
and
just
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
aroma
flavour
leaves
you
with
the
impression
of
drinking
this
beer
in
a
bakery
this
is
not
necessarily
an
insult
to
the
beer
its
probably
an
ok
accompaniment
with
a
few
sandwiches
or
even
danish
pastry
drier
than
i
expected
not
as
good
as
the
einbecker
urbock
dunkel
and
not
nearly
as
good
as
aass
bock
which
i
enjoyed
1
hour
earlier
a
bit
watery
but
still
a
drinkable
dunkel
that
wont
offend
anyone
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
but
clear
with
hints
of
red
if
held
to
the
light
the
foam
was
creamy
and
tan
and
it
clung
to
the
glass
and
left
some
lace
the
smell
was
modest
but
cocoa
caramel
and
malt
could
be
discerned
the
taste
was
cocoa
mild
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
with
very
low
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
bitter
crisp
finish
the
body
was
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
feel
the
drinkability
was
very
good
this
beer
was
easy
to
drink
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
very
small
head
and
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
very
pleasant
alcohol
is
also
slightly
apparent
in
the
nose
malt
is
very
apparent
in
the
flavor
it
is
very
smooth
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
the
fruit
taste
is
pretty
strong
in
the
taste
making
it
very
pleasant
on
the
tongue
great
beer
pours
out
a
clear
and
dark
garnet
colour
with
deep
ruby
hues
very
pretty
a
light
tan
head
appears
and
slowly
dissipates
to
a
thin
fine
lace
lovely
dark
fruit
and
candy
malt
aroma
with
the
typical
german
hop
notes
wafting
about
a
quite
reserved
but
tasty
dark
malt
flavour
hits
the
tastebuds
light
choco
and
caramel
sweet
dark
fruits
peek
through
all
rounded
out
by
some
noble
hops
in
the
end
a
somewhat
skimpy
but
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
lets
it
slide
right
down
my
throat
a
hint
of
crispness
in
the
finish
and
youre
left
wanting
to
take
another
sip
quite
quickly
damn
easy
drinking
and
rather
tasty
to
boot
a
fine
german
brew
this
brew
poured
a
medium
tan
head
with
small
to
medium
bubbles
the
lacing
was
very
sparse
on
the
sides
of
my
mug
i
had
a
hard
time
trying
to
figure
out
the
aroma
on
this
particular
brew
it
had
a
smooth
taste
but
it
was
on
the
watery
side
there
was
no
bitterness
noted
with
this
brew
it
lacks
character
and
i
was
not
very
impressed
with
this
drink
this
is
a
beer
searching
for
more
character
still
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
even
if
it
does
not
match
the
more
superior
beers
in
its
style
dark
brown
coloring
with
a
reddish
hue
fruity
aromas
of
grapedate
with
some
maltiness
to
boot
taste
is
dominated
by
tangyfruity
notesapple
and
appleskin
come
to
mind
a
little
bit
of
malty
sweetness
comes
into
play
as
the
beer
warms
but
it
remains
a
tart
sort
of
brew
all
the
way
through
solid
but
unspectacular
sometimes
a
guys
gotta
wonder
if
there
are
drinking
the
same
beer
as
others
are
but
my
experiences
differs
from
many
on
this
one
especially
with
the
aroma
which
was
all
hops
including
a
noticeable
aroma
upon
opening
the
bottle
now
a
nice
german
lager
hops
but
no
indication
of
malt
dark
brown
to

when
held
to
the

clear
short
and
thin
head
starts
as
a
european
pilsner
and
thats
a
taste
that
remains
throughout
middle

brings
on
the
roasted

the
longer
the

sits

more
the
malt
comes
through
its
all
very
short

interesting
mix
of

medium

interesting
beer
probably
more
of
a
dunkel
than
schwartzbier
mahagony

only
slightly

very

let
you

you
are
drinking
a

balanced
tasty
and
an
absolute
treat
for
the
taste
buds
i
highly
recommend
seeking
this
beer
out
not
a
lot
of
bas
like
this
style
and
i
certainly
understand
that
i
know
im
a
bit
of
a
wierdo
for
enjoying
maltforward
beers
like
this
if
you
like
bready
beers
like
skullsplitter
and
robert
the
bruce
youll
really
enjoy
this
its
an
imperial
version
of
a
classic
underappreciated
german
style
crafted
by
two
fantastic
breweries
one
of
which
great
lakes
just
might
be
the
single
best
brewer
of
domestic
lagers
that
there
is
dark
brown
in
color
with
ruby
edges
creamy
mouthfeel
touch
of
sweetness
on
the
flavor
profile
that
is
probably
coming
from
the
malt
the
finish
was
dry
and
bitter
but
there
was
also
an
odd
aftertaste
as
well
a
fine
offering
tons
of
roasted
notes
coming
off
this
one
a
nice
hint
of
honey
as
well
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
those
roasted
flavors
but
they
seem
toned
down
a
heavy
dose
of
chocolate
has
added
a
heap
of
sweetness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
nice
collab
they
should
do
this
again
pours
a
dark
brownish
black
color
with
a
whitefish
head
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
creamy
grain
a
bit
bready
from
lager
yeast
strain
in
the
taste
big
roasted
malt
and
a
small
earthy
woodsy
flavor
malts
are
full
of
charcoal
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
well
rounded
bitterness
keeps
the
beer
balanced
full
bodied
brew
with
a
creamier
feel
overall
this
is
a
big
ol
schwarzbier
but
at
the
same
time
drinks
like
a
much
lighter
beer
does
damage
to
sobriety
but
certainly
not
to
the
taste
buds
id
have
another
one
of
these
12oz
pour
at
the
world
of
beer
i
was
hyped
for
this
beer
because
i
have
had
some
great
cigar
city
beers
and
love
our
somewhat
local
great
lakes
big
mistake
very
dark
body
deep
brown
with
a
bit
of
mahogany
in
the
sides
and
a
finger
of
tan
head
weak
on
the
nose
a
hint
of
a
coffee
note
and
then
something
disturbingly
like
b
o
uncharacteristic
of
a
nice
clean
beer
malty
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
some
alcohol
wife
had
a
sip
as
well
and
was
not
impressed
either
watery
for
a
dark
beer
characteristic
of
schwarzbier
style
overall
i
was
completely
underwhelmed
save
your
get
an
edmund
fitzgerald
instead
the
beer
appears
dark
brown
nearing
black
with
a
thick
soapy
beige
head
the
aroma
offers
pine
alcohol
roast
chocolate
lots
of
chocolate
in
the
flavor
moderate
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
coffee
hop
presence
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
light
alcohol
heat
in
the
back
end
pretty
good
if
this
was
placed
in
front
of
me
as
a
judge
id
knock
it
substantially
for
the
lack
of
smoke
and
roast
but
as
a
casual
drinker
who
likes
a
nice
stout
i
mark
this
as
a
worthwhile
endeavor
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
something
i
will
pay
to
have
again
cola
brown
pour
pretty
opaque
topped
with
a
small
tan
head
moderate
retention
and
some
lacing
weird
aroma
aside
from
caramel
and
toasted
dark
bread
i
picked
up
a
strange
vegetal
scent
distinctively
reminiscent
of
fresh
peas
this
was
a
blind
tasting
and
though
i
had
no
idea
what
it
was
the
lager
yeast
definitely
came
through
up
front
in
the
taste
malty
nutty
sour
pumpernickeland
once
again
tasted
like
there
were
peas
in
my
beer
no
mistaking
a
flavor
that
distinct
some
dms
offflavors
if
i
had
to
guess
maybe
this
one
is
on
the
road
to
infection
if
its
not
there
already
lightmedium
body
but
about
right
for
the
style
not
something
id
want
more
than
a
sample
of
there
was
something
off
here
and
i
wasnt
digging
it
appears
black
under
a
beige
head
that
fades
to
random
bubbly
patches
smells
dark
and
malty
nutty
and
toasty
with
toffee
and
a
dark
fruit
note
reminiscent
of
plums
and
dates
deliciously
sweet
malty
flavor
berries
cherries
sweet
dark
bread
and
chocolate
mediumplus
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
lingering
sweetness
and
a
very
slight
tangy
quality
easy
to
drink
for
its
strength
and
despite
the
sweetness
imperial
schwarzbier
seems
like
a
style
worth
exploring
based
on
the
results
here
pours
with
a
minimal
head
on
a
roasty
coffee
bomb
with
mocha
lacing
loads
of
dark
roasty
grains
very
unexpected
flavor
in
this
lager
thin
brew
complete
surprise
faint
sweetness
in
the
finish
too
very
nice
brew
one
of
my
faves
from
the
series
as
an
imperial
schwarzbier
i
think
that
this
beer
does
quite
well
however
once
that
medley
of
flavors
hit
the
tongue
the
expectations
of
imperial
stout
mount
and
thats
simply
something
that
this
relatively
delicate
beer
is
incapable
of
contending
onyx
frothy
lingering
tan
head
with
aromas
laden
with
chocolate
and
light
roast
malt
hints
of
coffee
in
the
aroma
but
chocolate
dominates
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
but
more
chocolate
and
roast
malt
heavy
body
is
fairly
full
with
carbonation
slightly
fuller
than
expected
and
heavy
alcohol
warmth
theres
a
note
of
dark
fruit
and
phenols
definitely
more
characterful
and
less
roast
than
most
o
this
is
a
thick
beer
for
a
lager
and
it
is
loaded
with
flavor
plus
the
abv
is
nothing
to
overlook
i
like
it
because
of
its
stoutlike
mouthfeel
and
flavors
its
almost
like
a
light
stout
local
roots
will
have
it
on
tap
the
rest
of
the
week
hurry
and
get
a
growler
before
its
gone
o
a
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
not
a
favorite
but
recommended
and
i
would
definitely
buy
more
if
it
wasnt
a
onetime
collaboration
final
verdict
killer
black
lager
and
i
would
love
to
see
it
again
i
liked
it
and
thought
it
was
one
of
the
better
collaborations
i
have
tasted
from
cigar
city
and
being
done
with
great
lakes
glad
i
got
to
try
it
when
i
visited
great
lakes
as
it
is
a
very
limited
release
overall
now
here
is
a
beer
with
a
difference
a
beer
with
a
strong
chocolate
character
and
a
crisp
lager
finish
an
imperial
schwarz
i
just
love
it
o
this
beer
has
a
great
mouthfeel
but
overall
it
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
to
order
it
again
lots
of
local
tradition
involved
here
great
ingredients
a
very
good
beer
a
light
fruity
and
sweet
black
beer
dr
not
badly
priced
for
dublin
and
worthy
for
fans
of
the
style
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
is
quite
sessionable
a
very
pleasant
and
smooth
schwarzbier
although
i
could
live
without
the
candlegrease
flavours
it
might
go
well
with
mild
delicatessen
like
italian
mortadella
or
perhaps
a
brie
drinkability
surprisingly
unremarkable
very
drinkable
but
uninteresting
as
far
as
style
guidelines
go
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
straight
forward
schwarzbier
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
has
some
good
roasted
malt
flavors
but
is
also
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
it
was
a
nice
enjoyable
and
flavorful
beer
edit
drinkability
to
overall
d
very
drinkable
good
representation
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
style
that
im
starting
to
like
more
these
days
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
it
has
a
better
stronger
taste
and
is
easier
to
drink
then
the
others
ive
had
its
worth
a
try
sometime
md
great
carbonation
easy
to
drink
very
quaffable
not
sure
if
thats
a
word
but
you
know
what
i
mean
nice
body
could
drink
it
all
night
d
this
is
a
nice
schwarzbier
certainly
fits
the
bill
for
the
style
it
might
use
a
touch
more
hops
though
drinkability
seems
slightly
offstyle
for
a
schwarzbier
of
course
herold
never
claimed
it
was
one
calling
it
a
bohemian
black
lager
instead
regardless
great
lager
overall
but
not
as
refreshing
as
some
due
to
the
heavy
character
in
the
aftertaste
again
toasted
and
burnt
notes
and
then
a
long
bitterness
of
chicory
and
bitter
herbs
d
very
very
nice
dark
lager
drank
along
with
a
sam
adams
black
lager
and
this
blew
it
away
lovely
big
head
on
this
ebonybrown
beer
pearly
beige
and
very
tall
unfortunately
it
doesnt
last
very
long
nose
is
a
bit
mild
and
mannered
but
full
of
good
nut
and
chocolate
aromas
plus
toasted
grainy
bread
caramel
and
coffee
hops
cast
a
faint
evergreen
shadow
over
an
otherwise
completely
malty
nose
like
the
aroma
the
taste
is
mild
yet
lush
notes
of
cocoa
and
coffee
mingle
with
buttery
caramel
honey
and
biscuit
flavors
there
is
a
surprisingly
forward
element
of
spice
from
noble
hops
and
a
bit
of
spirited
alcohol
mostly
to
add
a
bit
of
balance
and
robustness
pleasantly
chewy
and
thick
but
also
wellattenuated
and
dry
not
my
favorite
schwarz
but
one
i
would
happily
have
again
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
was
a
surprise
my
first
ever
review
on
here
for
what
was
a
completely
randon
pick
from
my
local
tesco
drank
a
few
of
these
style
beers
when
in
prague
and
it
reminded
a
little
of
the
bottles
of
guiness
you
got
years
ago
before
the
draught
one
caught
on
quite
a
bitter
dry
finish
which
makes
you
keep
sipping
or
is
it
gulping
it
gets
better
the
more
you
try
it
only
1
40
for
a
500ml
bottle
get
in
there
overall
this
was
an
outstanding
representation
of
the
style
rich
deep
profile
with
a
superb
feel
and
a
really
nice
long
lasting
taste
if
you
are
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
or
just
looking
for
something
a
little
bit
different
just
check
this
one
out
its
worth
it
d
drinkability
was
very
smooth
rich
and
light
on
the
tongue
providing
for
a
good
experience
i
think
this
is
the
best
black
beer
style
wise
ive
ever
had
not
checked
my
other
review
scores
but
i
dont
remember
enjoying
one
this
much
before
a
very
nice
beer
thanks
brandoman63
for
the
opportunity
other
comments
i
was
surprised
at
how
roastybitter
this
beer
is
its
good
but
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
for
some
reason
overall
a
superb
schwarzbier
the
best
ive
tasted
so
far
definitely
recommended
a
tasty
and
very
sessionable
dark
lager
well
worth
a
pop
worth
trying
as
like
most
people
the
black
lager
just
got
me
too
curious
darkbrown
to
black
with
tan
tight
head
of
small
bubbles
grassy
whole
wheat
bread
aroma
medium
to
fullbodied
nice
carbonation
earthy
dark
crusty
sourdough
bread
taste
slightly
nutty
roasted
malts
and
grassy
hops
ends
with
slighly
sweet
malts
and
chocolatey
notes
nice
and
pretty
drinkable
for
a
somewhat
heavy
and
bready
beer
very
likeable
a
great
example
of
the
style
comforting
flavors
crazyeasy
to
drink
wish
id
bought
a
few
more
bottles
this
beer
is
truly
a
black
lager
opaque
with
on
light
very
nice
in
the
glass
with
a
fluffy
brown
head
with
small
bubbles
that
fell
fairly
quickly
the
smell
is
really
great
lots
of
roast
and
toasted
malt
caramel
in
the
nose
but
not
overwhelming
and
no
hint
of
coffe
the
roast
continues
in
the
same
vein
for
the
taste
clear
no
coffee
very
nice
roast
malt
taste
a
little
chewy
but
smooth
as
well
it
is
a
spicy
bite
as
well
but
again
light
from
the
carbonation
and
hop
that
is
very
balanced
with
the
malt
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
not
complex
but
very
smooth
tasty
and
refreshing
while
not
being
light
drinkability
an
exellent
schwarzbier
some
nice
roastyness
character
flavours
and
settles
well
could
drink
a
few
but
would
like
to
compare
with
other
czech
schwarz
and
koztrizer
a
bit
of
fruit
and
chocolate
sweetness
and
quite
a
bit
of
hops
pumpernickel
bread
and
a
bit
of
molasses
round
it
out
an
interestingly
complex
beer
the
flavors
mold
together
in
a
strange
way
cant
say
that
ive
had
a
similar
experience
before
poured
at
50
degrees
into
tumbler
beer
was
dark
but
not
opaque
good
smell
of
molases
and
taste
hinted
of
that
also
had
a
bit
of
a
sweet
after
taste
and
not
bitter
which
i
like
fair
head
at
first
then
went
away
a
very
good
black
beer
i
would
purchase
this
again
i
like
it
very
drinkable
a
very
decent
schwartzbier
but
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
this
style
to
say
for
sure
pours
a
three
finger
light
brown
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
shallow
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
black
color
light
carbonation
and
mediumheavy
bodied
caramel
nose
starts
malty
with
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
not
cloying
finish
has
hints
of
hops
nice
black
lager
2
49
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
ia
poured
a
smooth
but
thin
looking
nearblack
in
color
lots
of
foamy
head
that
was
slightly
tinted
khaki
not
much
light
could
pierce
through
the
glass
nose
is
malty
and
just
a
hint
of
smoke
and
ash
rise
to
the
nostrils
nice
mild
beer
superbly
drinkable
no
particular
sulphuric
tones
which
has
been
the
downfall
of
many
schwarzbiers
in
my
experience
lots
of
toasted
malts
thin
feeling
but
appropriately
so
drinkability
an
exellent
schwarzbier
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
of
the
ones
ive
had
this
schwarzbier
has
more
of
a
pleasant
smoky
charater
very
good
taste
is
rich
and
roasty
malt
light
efferescent
carb
at
first
develops
a
mildly
sour
fruity
note
later
which
is
pretty
subdued
freshness
is
key
for
optimal
taste
ive
had
old
bottles
that
were
lackluster
supremely
easy
to
drink
and
pure
velvet
on
the
palate
give
me
about
six
of
these
and
il
call
you
next
week
d
solid
beer
recommended
if
i
were
to
single
out
a
beer
i
would
buy
perpetually
this
would
be
it
unfortunately
finding
enough
to
buy
perpetually
is
the
more
difficult
task
i
havent
found
another
place
that
carries
it
here
and
harrys
carries
it
in
small
quantities
md
a
touch
too
smooth
for
this
fantastic
lager
but
the
caskinterpretation
is
not
bad
at
all
the
low
fizziness
makes
this
beer
slightly
watery
at
the
back
but
this
remains
a
mediumbodied
and
fullsome
czech
dark
lager
which
is
less
rich
and
positively
smoother
a
nice
experiment
that
i
feel
so
happy
to
bump
into
twice
at
jdw
pubs
and
feel
even
more
lucky
that
its
on
form
on
both
visits
this
beer
pours
av
ery
deep
brown
with
a
thick
bubbly
head
rich
sweet
malty
smells
abound
and
are
carried
through
to
similar
flavors
with
chocolatey
fruity
notes
its
a
little
toasty
on
the
finsh
very
smooth
and
drinkable
it
would
make
a
very
good
winter
beer
but
isnt
a
load
for
all
the
flavor
you
get
i
like
it
mouthfeel
is
pretty
dry
clean
on
the
palate
as
well
medium
bodied
i
would
say
a
decent
all
around
beer
flavor
is
that
same
green
apple
along
with
a
chocolatey
malt
base
and
a
slightly
roasted
bitterness
it
all
comes
together
exceptionally
smoothly
with
a
suprisingly
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
which
is
nice
but
something
lighter
would
really
make
this
brew
heavenly
i
dont
know
much
about
schwarzbier
but
i
know
this
is
a
new
favorite
of
mine
no
matter
what
you
call
it
overall
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
dark
brownblack
in
appearance
with
a
light
tan
head
which
bubbled
high
and
fell
fast
the
smell
is
mainly
malt
with
a
fair
amount
of
yeast
nice
black
malt
flavors
with
some
sugary
notes
somewhere
between
chocolate
and
vanilla
not
to
say
this
beer
is
very
sweet
but
there
is
some
residual
sweetness
countered
with
plenty
of
bitterness
yet
that
is
not
to
say
this
beer
is
hoppy
because
there
is
not
much
hop
that
i
noticed
but
mainly
malty
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
with
a
lagerlike
crispness
and
velvety
richness
this
brew
is
nice
and
complex
yet
is
not
overpowering
in
any
one
way
id
recommend
this
one
pours
a
black
colour
with
a
long
lasting
tan
head
lots
of
roasted
malt
in
the
aroma
some
some
caramel
too
sweet
malty
flavour
some
roasted
notes
too
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
it
is
very
soft
and
easy
drinking
one
of
the
best
schwartzbier
i
have
ever
tasted
this
is
a
very
nice
schwarzbier
one
of
my
favorite
lager
styles
complex
and
well
balanced
this
one
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
a
must
try
if
you
enjoy
dark
lagers
this
beer
is
similar
in
color
to
a
good
porter
just
a
bit
of
light
gets
through
very
little
head
only
a
small
ring
around
the
edge
the
smell
is
pretty
faint
maybe
a
little
hint
of
roasted
grains
the
taste
is
of
roasted
grains
with
a
slight
colalike
taste
thrown
in
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
lift
this
beer
up
high
there
is
absolutly
no
negative
aftertase
a
very
smooth
beer
slight
bitterness
is
noted
as
for
drinkabilty
this
is
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
i
was
somewhat
relunctant
to
try
this
one
but
now
im
sorry
i
waited
so
long
this
beer
will
be
on
my
list
to
try
often
this
was
my
first
from
this
brewer
it
makes
me
want
to
try
their
other
selections
a
good
beer
worthy
of
much
praise
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
i
can
think
of
for
converting
bmc
drinkers
who
think
guinness
is
too
dark
it
has
that
full
flavored
yet
light
taste
and
its
more
chuggable
than
bmc
could
ever
dream
of
being
500
ml
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
served
chilled
in
a
pilsner
glass
pours
black
between
that
of
a
porter
and
a
stout
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
1
finger
brown
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
smells
of
sweet
chocolate
roasted
malts
figs
apples
and
a
hint
of
metal
right
as
i
opened
the
bottle
there
is
both
sweet
and
bitter
chocolate
on
the
palate
along
with
toasted
malts
coffee
figs
a
bit
of
raisins
apples
and
greenspicy
hops
kinda
like
an
imperial
stout
quite
nice
it
has
a
medium
to
light
body
that
is
tingly
like
a
lager
yet
smooth
a
delicious
lager
thats
better
than
köstritzer
in
my
opinion
d
this
is
a
good
solid
schwarzbier
that
has
a
nice
complexity
to
the
dark
malts
and
a
smoothness
to
the
finish
it
would
be
nice
to
see
a
hint
more
hops
for
balance
or
some
alcohol
warmth
i
know
that
is
not
to
style
very
black
in
color
with
a
nice
chestnut
hue
when
held
to
the
light
small
tan
head
decent
aromamalty
with
some
roasted
notes
good
malty
bold
flavor
with
a
blend
of
roasted
and
chocolate
notes
theres
a
tad
hashness
i
cant
place
my
finger
on
it
almost
seems
as
it
might
be
a
freshness
issue
overall
the
flavor
is
well
done
just
this
one
element
of
it
good
body
for
style
a
very
drinkable
beer
more
roasted
flavor
then
a
lot
of
schwarzbiers
i
have
had
tends
to
be
a
bit
more
upfront
and
pronounced
overall
the
dark
lagerschwarzbier
style
is
really
growing
on
me
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
finest
black
lagers
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
herold
bohemian
black
lager
is
an
excellent
schwarzbier
as
noted
ive
only
had
a
handful
but
i
recognize
a
good
one
when
i
drink
it
if
you
like
incredibly
flavorful
amazingly
drinkable
dark
lagers
be
sure
to
seek
this
one
out
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
had
a
tan
colored
head
that
lasted
a
minute
or
two
the
taste
is
very
mellow
with
very
little
evidence
of
hops
and
no
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
reminscent
of
coffee
would
make
a
good
dessert
beer
and
i
think
that
it
would
go
nicel
with
a
piece
of
dark
chocolate
it
would
be
a
poor
choice
for
a
heavy
drinking
session
as
it
has
a
somewhat
cloying
effect
an
interesting
beer
though
not
one
that
im
likely
to
get
again
any
time
soon
again
the
same
coffee
flavors
as
on
the
nose
but
more
pronounced
on
the
tongue
mild
flavors
of
toasted
malts
slight
hop
bitterness
that
carries
a
little
ways
into
the
finish
finishes
also
with
some
lingering
roasted
malt
notes
and
a
slight
astringency
pours
an
opaque

some

in
the
maltiness
could
have
been
a
little
crisper
the
mouthfeel
was
a
touch
disappointing
it
started
off
much
too
light
almost
watery
then
the
flavors
kicked
in
and
saved
it
im
not

what
causes
this
phenomenon
it
could
have
been
me
despite
this
the
beer
is
good
and
makes
a

definatly
one
to

make

very
fresh
clean

mingled

leaving
you
with
a
lingering

at
the

making
you
want
for
more
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
when
drunken
ice
cold
very
drinkable
i
reached
the
bottom
of
each
glass
before
i
knew
it
simple
as
an
earthworm
but
much
tastier
nothing
groundbreaking
here
just
a
good
solid
brew
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
and
i
must
be
honest
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
it
pours
a
very
dark
opaque
black
with
a
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
to
nothing
it
leaves
virtually
no
lacing
and
little
to
no
legs
the
nose
is
roasty
with
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
but
lightly
scented
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
good
amount
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
also
a
little
hops
it
is
very
light
on
the
palate
im
not
totally
sure
how
to
judge
this
one
i
enjoy
it
but
at
the
same
time
dont
cant
wait
to
try
other
beers
of
this
style
so
i
can
get
a
better
idea
of
what
its
going
for
i
honestly
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
when
i
opened
this
brew
other
than
the
shorts
name
glad
i
picked
it
up
o
not
bad
by
any
means
reminded
me
more
of
a
watery
black
ipa
would
make
a
nice
winter
session
beer
o
this
beer
seems
to
taste
like
a
hybrid
between
a
schwarzbier
and
a
porter
gotta
be
honest
impressed
i
like
the
depth
of
flavor
on
this
beer
i
had
no
idea
this
was
being
bottle
released
this
year
but
saw
it
in
my
bottle
shop
and
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
so
incredibly
glad
i
did
its
reminiscent
of
a
porter
but
adds
more
smokechar
to
the
flavor
and
theres
that
great
sort
of
nutty
aftertaste

i
had
purchased

overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
still
think
i
like
sustenance
black
bier
a
little
more
but
this
beer
was
pretty
close
to
being
as
good
and
it
reminded
me
a
little
of
their
uncle
steves
irish
stout
it
had
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
some
great
balance
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
clean
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
lots
of
this
stuff
without
getting
bored
with
it
its
very
sessionable
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
and
how
drinkable
it
was
those
two
things
really
made
this
beer
stand
out
as
a
well
made
schwarzbier
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
is
that
its
not
available
on
its
own
this
would
be
a
great
seasonal
beer
to
release
in
six
packs
at
the
start
of
ski
season
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
ill
try
to
stock
up
before
its
all
gone
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
or
dark
beers
in
general
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
i
already
knew
shorts
had
some
skills
when
it
came
to
this
style
and
they
didnt
disappoint
great
job
guys
thanks
for
another
impressive
shorts
brew
and
keep
up
the
good
work
o
very
good
offering
from
shorts
pitch
black
brew
with
nice
mocha
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lace
after
each
drink

forward
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
smells
nice
malt
black
licorice
some
spice
bread
solid
brew
glad
i
tried
it
id
love
to
have
this
again
at
shanty
creak
on
a
winter
day
o
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
one
it
was
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
not
too
dry
an
overall
good
lager
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
beers
flavoring
especially
when
coupled
with
the
soft
feel
and
great
ease
of
drinkability
we
thought
long
and
hard
about
the
aroma
which
was
pleasant
and
fit
right
to
the
style
but
was
pushed
a
bit
into
the
extremes
of
the
ashtray
nose
this
did
however
add
to
the
ultimate
thrust
of
the
beer
in
its
entirety
rounding
out
its
presentation
this
is
an
odd
style
to
attempt
these
days
but
we
found
this
effort
to
be
much
appreciated
from
the
point
of
variety
this
is
an
easy
beer
and
although
a
bit
bright
around
the
edges
this
would
suit
any
craft
beer
drinker
looking
for
something
new
and
strongly
executed
or
someone
looking
to
get
into
the
style
outright
this
beer
is
also
highly
characteristic
of
shorts
and
it
fits
their
brand
wonderfully
overall
a
nice
light
bourbon
barrel
beer
pretty
light
and
nicely
simple
some
lager
aspects
to
it
in
taste
and
feel
id
say
its
a
strong
bourbon
tasting
beer
with
very
little
others
tastes
and
very
low
other
character
interesting
beer
not
meant
to
be
compared
to
say
bourbon
county
stout
or
anything
like
that
but
on
its
own
this
is
an
interesting
flavourful
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
a
lighter
beer
with
some
bourbon
flavour
in
it
it
holds
up
well
surprisingly
despite
the
relatively
thin
body
and
malt
presence
reviewed
6708
im
not
going
to
knife
anyone
for
another
bottle
but
im
seriously
enjoying
it
if
the
world
were
fair
it
would
get
bonus
points
for
being
a
relatively
low
abv
barrelaged
beer
very
good
its
hard
to
believe
this
beer
is
only
6
5
abv
the
bourbon
character
is
very
strong
and
very
forward
it
starts
strong
and
finishs
strong
leaving
a
warmth
that
engulfs
your
throat
and
even
the
upperhalf
of
your
chest
after
each
swallow
not
so
much
robust
as
it
is
unabashedly
powerful
while
i
still
enjoyed
the
beer
some
time
in
the
cellar
might
provide
a
smoother
flavor
profile
with
a
slightly
toned
down
alcohol
assault
fresh
this
ones
a
slow
sipper
shorts
wasnt
too
far
off
with
their
slogan
for
this
one
for
when
youre
hungry
and
thirsty
m
light
to
medium
body
with
a
slight
chew
moderate
carbonation
a
touch
thin
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
finger
of
head
that
shrinks
rather
quickly
smell
is
a
big
punch
of
sweet
bourbon
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
wow
is
that
bourbony
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
big
bourbon
presence
with
a
slightly
boozy
taste
the
beer
is
rather
thin
but
surprising
amounts
of
carbonation
overall
a
beer
unlike
any
ive
had
not
an
incredible
beer
but
definitely
one
of
a
kind
and
worth
a
try
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
frequently
a
dark
brown
to
the
point
of
black
with
subtle
mahogany
hues
near
the
very
edges
a
tiny
bit
of
creamcolored
head
forms
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
behind
aroma
is
of
bourbon
toffee
toasted
marshmallow
caramel
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
and
some
vanilla
tastes
pretty
similar
but
with
an
emphasis
on
the
bourbon
and
a
tiny
bit
of
raw
ethanol
tacked
on
the
end
caramel
toffee
toasted
sugars
and
vanilla
all
come
through
quite
well
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
anticipated
and
this
one
finishes
relatively
clean
warming
alcohol
on
the
end
overall
this
one
took
to
the
bourbon
very
well
id
be
happy
to
have
another
anytime
this
one
gave
me
some
headaches
just
wondering
what
to
pour
a
bourbonbarrel
aged
lager
into
it
pours
out
pretty
black
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
shrinks
to
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
goddamn
thats
bourbony
the
taste
is
also
great
and
interesting
it
is
very
strong
on
the
bourbon
at
first
but
goes
interestingly
tart
pretty
quick
the
finish
cancels
out
the
tartness
for
some
roasted
malts
and
some
more
of
the
bourbon
flavors
and
a
touch
of
wood
the
body
is
extremely
light
especially
for
a
beer
with
such
a
bourbon
taste
it
works
with
that
tartness
in
the
middle
though
the
drinkability
is
good
what
an
interesting
brew
from
shorts
i
was
a
little
skeptical
but
it
works
out
better
than
i
expected
o
i
would
say
this
beer
is
very
solid
i
am
not
sure
though
what
the
hell
i
just
drank
though
haha
not
familar
with
the
style
and
such
style
beer
aged
in
bourbon
barrel
stellar
aroma
of
roasted
dark
malts
and
aged
barrel
tannin
smokiness
the
flavour
is
equally
well
delivered
a
sweet
caramelized
toasted
malt
portfolio
with
a
well
balanced
vanilla
oak
background
and
a
decent
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
the
finish
is
pleasantly
dry
with
a
slight
surprising
black
licorice
note
and
lingers
for
an
impressive
length
of
time
drink
it
was
okay
wasnt
a
wow
but
wasnt
bad
i
not
being
a
fan
of
schwarzbiers
came
into
this
with
an
open
mind
i
wouldnt
mind
another
bottle
to
age
though
add
this
to
the
list
of
middle
of
the
road
shorts
offerings
hey
i
consider
it
a
win
when
my
drain
doesnt
share
a
shorts
with
me
light
body
with
a
nice
soft
carbonation
enough
to
contribute
to
a
drinkable
beer
flavors
are
a
bit
weird
for
me
though
dark
black
in
color
with
no
light
shining
thorough
at
all
had
the
look
of
a
monster
stout
with
a
big
head
of
tan
that
capped
it
nicely
settling
down
after
a
few
moments
into
a
nice
pillow
that
left
tons
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
hoppy
at
first
but
then
comes
through
with
a
deep
roasted
and
smoked
note
that
really
gives
it
a
good
bit
of
depth
nice
touches
here
of
caramel
hints
of
cocoa
and
loads
of
piney
hops
really
nicely
done
and
quite
different
then
what
i
was
expecting
warming
really
brought
this
out
and
each
sip
was
a
nice
progression
from
biting
hops
mellow
smoked
malts
and
a
rich
semi
sweet
and
dry
finish
overall
definitely
a
unique
brew
which
id
like
to
try
again
ontap
at
some
point
im
admittedly
not
a
huge
fan
of
a
tart
component
in
richer
maltier
roastier
beers
though
also
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
foam
from
a
schwarzbier
but
the
bourbon
component
might
have
adversely
affected
this
try
for
yourself
o
a
nice
beer
and
something
different
which
is
always
good
not
many
barrel
aged
schwarzbiers
out
there
that
i
know
of
great
fall
beer
as
it
was
dark
roasty
yet
very
drinkable
and
the
smell
while
not
overpowering
was
quite
eclectic
would
have
again
shorts
brewing
company
continues
to
impress
bourbon
barrel
sustenance
is
very
solid
allaround
bourbon
barrelaging
a
schwarzbier
who
wouldve
thought
it
works
extremely
well
though
the
moderate
bourbon
presence
was
a
great
call
it
complements
rather
than
overpowers
very
good
stuff
easy
recommendation
o
an
improvement
over
the
standard
sustenance
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
would
not
buy
it
again
odecent
beer
that
smells
great
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
and
at
6
5abv
id
have
a
couple
more
if
i
had
them
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
to
light
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
hits
with
a
strenght
that
seems
more
than
the
listed
6
5
overall
this
opened
up
very
impressive
but
sort
of
fell
apart
as
it
warmed
up
the
barrel
aged
presence
while
enjoyable
is
very
overpowering
if
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
look
for
in
barrel
aged
beers
you
might
really
dig
this
brew
which
normally
is
the
case
for
me
for
some
reason
this
one
just
didnt
drive
it
all
the
way
home
like
i
was
hoping
regardless
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
thanks
again
dunt
mouthfeel
is
not
quite
as
full
as
id
expect
from
a
beer
like
this
and
id
prefer
a
smoother
finish
but
then
again
whos
ever
tried
to
barrelage
a
schwarzbier
before
kudos
to
shorts
for
pushing
the
envelope
an
interesting
beer
not
my
favorite
bourbon
barrel
aged
brew
by
any
stretch
but
worth
a
try
i
enjoyed
this
o
this
was
a
tough
one
for
me
to
finish
as
much
as
i
like
bourbon
barreled
beers
this
one
seemed
like
it
was
a
bit
too
much
hard
to
finish
but
if
you
want
bourbon
here
it
is
o
i
like
bourbon
barrel
soaked
sustenance
black
beer
less
than
its
little
brother
too
much
barrel
not
enough
base
beer
this
beer
also
cannot
compete
with
shorts
preeminent
barrelaged
beer
which
is
barrelaged
wizard
serving
type
bottle
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
but
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
me
definitely
an
interesting
bal
aged
beer
refreshingly
different
and
tasty
overall
an
interesting
barrel
aged
beer
from
shorts
as
i
always
say
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
would
i
seek
it
out
again
probably
not
but
i
am
rather
enjoying
the
flavors
though
they
are
a
bit
one
dimensional
smacking
you
in
the
face
with
each
one
but
then
again
isnt
that
what
shorts
is
known
for
not
as
cloying
as
i
would
expect
but
would
never
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
overall
good
im
a
little
indifferent
at
this
point
a
little
less
complexity
then
i
remember
from
years
past
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
feels
a
lot
lighter
than
a
lot
of
stouts
and
porters
a
nice
winter
drink
when
you
dont
want
something
real
heavy
a
nice
winner
from
shorts
and
ill
have
to
remember
to
try
this
on
tap
since
i
think
it
will
be
really
creamy
medium
bodied
and
slightly
viscous
with
a
very
prominent
bourbon
flavor
again
as
in
the
aroma
the
barrel
character
dominates
the
flavor
with
a
burst
of
hot
boozy
bourbon
that
lingers
throughout
slightly
overpowering
the
other
flavors
slight
earthy
oak
and
faint
vanillatoasted
coconut
but
the
bourbon
and
hot
alcohol
overtake
these
notes
pretty
quickly
underneath
there
is
a
roasted
chocolate
malt
presence
with
hints
of
roasted
coffee
bean
toffee
and
oatmeal
slightly
smokey
which
provides
some
balance
to
the
sweet
bourbon
but
overall
this
beer
is
just
a
bit
too
much
of
a
bourbon
bomb
for
my
liking
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
really
improving
a
beer
as
the
regular
black
sustenance
is
pretty
underwhelming
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
love
to
see
shorts
do
again

not

one
of

to

minus
the
aroma
which
was
a
bit
potent
d
this
beer
has
very
good
drinkability
it
has
a
great
bourbon
presence
but
there
is
also
a
nice
tartness
to
it
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
especially
now
that
i
see
it
is
retired
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
but
i
doubt
that
will
happen
great
beer
though
cheers
d
a
very
nice
treat
the
senses
say
one
thing
while
the
texture
says
something
different
very
complex
and
a
nice
suprise
im
very
please
and
wish
i
bought
more
d
the
low

and
sorta
thinnish
read
not

make
for
one
hell
of
a
drinkable
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
totally
sessionable
and
frigging
delicious
pretty
good
bal
aged
beer
but
not
a
standout
very
good
beer
i
would
have
enjoyed
another
glass
but
there
were
too
many
other
options
on
tap
worth
a
try
if
available
to
you
draft
stopped
in
the
brewery
and
had
a
little
sampler
of
several
beers
very
similiar
to
the
regular
version
with
the
exception
of
the
bourbon
flavors
and
notes
very
distinct
bourbon
notes
in
the
nose
fairly
strong
bourbon
flavors
in
the
taste
along
with
vanilla
and
chocolate
very
smooth
tan
head
with
good
lace
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
picked

at

dark

color
with

is
a
combination
of
vanilla
oak
and
caramel
bourbon
is
also
present
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
vanilla
and
oak
again
very
buttery
probably
the
lightest
bourbon
aged
beer
ive
tried
very
sweet
and
mellow
with
more
hints
of
molasses
and
caramel
very
good
moderately
more
impressed
with
this
than
the
regular
sustenance
and
well
worth
a
try
btw
if
youre
ever
in
se
michigan
and
arent
a
vegetarian
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
get
to
slows
bar
bq
where
the
beer
list
is
very
good
and
the
food
is
amazing
overall
this
one
is
hot
and
not
too
drinkable
interesting
but
i
am
not
too
crazy
for
it
still
i
was
happy
to
have
tried
this
one
d
a
pretty
unique
beer
i
appreciate
what
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
has
done
to
a
somewhat
simple
beer
drinks
nicely
although
i
question
the
abv
a
bit
well
done
shorts
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nearly
black
it
would
fool
me
if
not
for
the
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
a
small
head
1cm
or
maybe
less
forms
on
top
with
loose
bubbles
that
fade
quickly
no
lacing
but
i
can
see
plenty
of
bubbles
rising
up
in
the
beer
the
smell
hits
you
with
an
incredible
sweetness
backed
up
with
a
very
nice
bourbon
smell
like
chocolate
a
little
coffee
and
a
big
whiff
of
bourbon
otherwise
very
clean
the
taste
comes
back
with
that
nice
sweetness
a
very
clean
straightforward
roasty
character
almost
no
yeast
character
to
speak
of
no
hoppy
presence
just
a
nice
mellow
flavor
of
bourbon
i
mean
dont
get
me
wrong
you
know
the
bourbon
is
there
but
it
really
fits
well
into
this
beer
very
nice
the
body
is
right
around
medium
maybe
a
little
thin
with
a
nice
burst
of
carbonation
the
bourbon
does
a
nice
job
coating
your
mouth
but
overall
the
sweetness
keeps
it
in
check
really
i
dont
know
if
theres
anything
off
for
the
bourbon
but
there
isnt
really
anything
that
stands
out
for
a
bourbonbarrel
aged
schwarzbier
this
seems
right
on
and
i
dont
know
if
anyone
else
makes
one
but
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
i
havent
had
good
luck
with
black
beers
in
the
past
and
was
looking
forward
to
another
mediocre
expedition
thankfully
shorts
has
a
high
standard
and
this
was
no
exception
amazing
d
pretty
good
but
the
abv
catches
up
to
you
fast
wasnt
really
expecting
it
to
hit
me
like
that
this
is
a
fairly
onedimensional
beer
with
the
bourbon
being
quite
dominant
if
you
can
appreciate
that
sort
of
thing
then
you
will
likely
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
is
done
pretty
well
here
this
does
have
a
nice
vanillin
and
coconut
character
to
it
though
it
is
a
bit
hot
and
spicy
from
the
bourboned
alcohol
at
times
i
could
definitely
wish
for
more
dark
malt
character
to
come
through
but
this
more
than
a
serviceable
brew
for
this
chilly
arizona
weekend
d
i
wondered
to
myself
what
this
beer
was
like
back
in
late
springearly
summer
and
realized
i
really
didnt
care
because
what
it
is
now
is
plenty
enjoyable
mellow
and
soothing
a
fine
way
to
celebrate
an
awesome
105102
blazers
win
over
phoenix
the
best
game
ive
seen
live
in
several
seasons
not
the
prototypical
schwarzbier
but
so
what
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
someday
worth
seeking
this
is
a
beer
which
rewards
patient
slow
drinking
let
it
warm
up
and
breathe
the
base
beer
feels
a
bit
overshadowed
by
oaky
tartness
but
the
bourbon
is
amazingly
well
integrated
the
hint
of
oxidation
in
the
nose
doesnt
really
show
up
in
the
taste
the
beer
displays
alternating
moments
of
sweetness
and
roastiness
with
tons
of
barrel
character
it
adds
up
to
a
beer
id
be
happy
to
drink
again
any
time
recommended
drinkability
btw
the
lower
abv
and
the
outstanding
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
all
day
hv
rbsg09
bottle
at
the
grand
tasting
pours
dark
amber
brown
with
a
beige
head
epic
aroma
lots
of
bourbon
obviously
but
also
dark
fruits
bananas
and
chocolate
flavor
is
roasty
and
chocolatey
with
some
tart
bourbon
vanilla
and
a
woody
dry
finish
d
this
is
a
beautiful
bourbon
soaked
beer
from
shorts
to
say
the
least
really
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
as
ive
loved
everything
ive
had
from
shorts
in
the
past
especially
their
dark
beers
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
frothy
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
huge
sour
bourbon
and
vinegar
aroma
more
pungent
than
any
barrel
aged
beer
i
have
come
across
the
taste
begins
with
oak
flavors
followed
by
cocoa
alcohol
and
sour
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
goes
down
easy
with
significant
carbonation
that
tingles
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
i
would
not
have
more
than
on
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
truly
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
had
to
date
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
ruby
highlights
and
a
huge
bubbly
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
smells
of
lemony
citrus
bourbon
vanilla
faint
bit
of
bretty
horsehair
and
cocoa
slightly
sour
on
the
nose
is
that
supposed
to
be
there
or
did
some
bugs
hitch
a
ride
from
barrel
to
bottle
this
would
certainly
explain
the
spirited
carbonation
taste
is
a
bit
sour
with
some
chocolate
bourbon
and
vanilla
thrown
in
carbonation
is
quite
high
body
is
medium
but
filled
with
bubbles
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
slick
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
im
not
sure
its
a
schwartzbier
anymore
very
flavorful
but
the
carbonation
ruins
the
mouthfeel
for
me
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
if
someone
wants
to
send
me
another
pours
black
in
color
with
just
a
bit
of
froth
for
a
head
smell
is
bourbon
cocoa
and
some
vanilla
to
round
it
out
this
smells
absolutely
incredible
taste
is
more
of
the
bourbon
some
cocoa
and
a

of

this
is
very
good
for
a
schwarzbier
very
smooth
and
i
cant
even
put
into
words
how
drinkable
this
is
its
often
overstated

i
could
drink
this
everyday

wonderful
beer
from

thanks
again
jeff
you
da
man
drinkability
is
a
tossup
some
really
drinkable
elements
but
its
so
unique
im
not
sure
how
to
grade
it
im
really
glad
i
tried
this
such
a
unique
beer
and
by
the
time
it
really
warmed
up
i
think
it
really
came
into
its
own
a
big
black
beer
with
a

poured

that
is
quite
unique

a

it

out
hope
to

again
in

to

interesting
beer
the
lighter
body
of
a
schwarzbier
gives
an
entirely
different
mouthfeel
and
drinking
experience
than
most
other
heavier
bourbon
barrel
beers
like
it
or
dislike
it
its
certainly
a
different
approach
i
happen
to
like
it
at
least
for
a
change
of
pace
but
i
dont
think
it
reaches
the
heights
of
the
best
bourbon
barrel
beers
pours
black
with
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
short
head
smells
of
some
very
light
graininess
lightly
of
bourbon
and
with
some
dark
chocolate
tastes
light
and
clean
with
noticeable
bourbon
but
on
the
lighter
side
quite
dry
in
style
the
beer
is
also
slightly
astringent
and
soft
with
a
clean
roasted
grain
flavor
throughout
soft
and
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
cocoa
finish
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
surprise
drinkability
is
quite
good
i
ranked
it
high
mostly
due
to
its
uniqueness
this
is
really
interesting
and
enjoyable
to
taste
but
with
that
said
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
its
pretty
tasty
and
very
possibly
like
nothing
you
have
ever
tasted
thanks
adam
d
very
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
bold
but
not
over
the
top
at
a
loss
we
pulled
out
a
bottle
of
jeffersons
bourbon
to
smell
and
ended
up
sipping
then
went
back
to
the
beer
it
didnt
help
the
final
verdict
sour
black
lager
aged
too
long
in
a
bourbon
barrel
notes
from
52008
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
swift
moving
carbonation
and
plenty
of
it
this
goes
down
rather
easily
but
the
bubbles
are
a
little
much
overall
the
wild
yeast
twist
to
this
beer
made
it
taste
a
lot
different
that
i
was
expecting
this
reminds
me
of
a
jolly
pumpkin
brew
expect
aged
in
bourbon
i
did
end
up
enjoying
the
bomber
and
thanks
to
hoppymeal
for
the
opportunity
to
be
honest
if
it
was
going
for
the
wild
characteristic
itd
have
gotten
a
higher
rating
in
my
eyes
while
it
wasnt
anticipated
i
cant
stress
enough
that
its
not
bad

all

pretty

with

d
this
is
one
of
the
best
schwarzbiers
ive
ever
had
and
i
think
the
bourbon
barrel
use
is
very
well
done
this
is
my
first
shorts
brew
and
im
looking
forward
to
more
highly
recommended
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
one
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
that
remains
lacing
is
just
about
nonexistant
meh
smell
is
interesting
cherries
wet
charred
oak
and
bourbon
up
front
aromas
of
caramel
roasted
nuts
and
moist
cardboard
hit
the
nose
as
well
just
an
overall
unique
beer
to
whiff
luckily
the
beer
improves
drastically
after
first
sip
smokey
sweet
malts
brown
sugar
and
molasses
hit
the
tongue
right
off
the
smooth
bourbon
flavors
emerge
midway
with
a
hefty
oak
backbone
aftertaste
consists
of
dark
fruits
figs
raisins
and
dates
light
body
with
a
strong
carbonation
that
stings
the
entire
mouth
i
was
expecting
a
smoother
feel
to
it
seeing
its
a
barrel
aged
beer
but
thats
what
i
get
for
assuming
the
smell
actually
makes
this
beer
difficult
for
me
to
drink
ive
never
experienced
a
beer
that
varies
so
much
from
nose
to
tongue
interesting
beer
for
sure
that
seems
to
be
all
over
the
place
but
what
else
can
you
expect
from
shorts
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
though
not
sure
about
aging
this
but
i
have
a
bottle
in
the
cellar
that
ill
pull
out
in
a
few
months
and
see
how
much
its
changed
definitely
and
odd
one
but
it
wouldnt
be
a
shorts
brew
if
it
wasnt
odd
ive
not
had
something
quite
like
this
before
but
it
works
well
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
with
strong
bourbon
characteristics
that
make
for
a
truly
hearty
schwarzbier
i
can
see
having
this
with
big
thanksgiving
spread
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
filmy
head
nose
seems
to
show
some
contamination
with
wild
yeast
and
funk
some
mild
fruit
character
plum
and
strawberry
and
a
touch
of
whiskey
flavors
seem
to
be
very
muted
a
light
touch
of
the
base
beer
with
also
a
light
hint
of
the
barrel
not
much
to
report
not
a
lot
of
flavor
super
thin
mouth
feel
with
very
little
texture
i
dont
care
for
this
beer
d
this
is
definitely
an
easy
and
balanced
drinker
i
was
a
little
worried
about
this
being
heavy
but
it
isnt
at
all
all
in
all
an
excellent
brew
i
hope
the
regular
sustenance
makes
a
return
so
i
can
compare
if
memory
serves
me
right
most
of
the
difference
is
in
the
finish
with
mild
vanilla
notes
being
the
main
difference
in
the
taste
overall
a
fantastic

from

im
not
too
sure
i
like
this
more
than
their
black
diamond
which
is
a
pretty
similar
beer
but
its
still
one
that
id
like
to
have
again
when
i
want
a
dark
beer
thats
not
quite
a
stout
or
a
porter
decent
enough
i
think
they
tried
to
do
too
much
with
this
one
instead
of
the
acidityacrid
notes
id
like
to
see
a
little
more
sweetness
maybe
honey
added
to
this
one
to
give
it
a
little
better
presence
o
i
like
this
brew
especially
the
fruity
character
i
get
out
of
it
a
nice
thumbs
up
here
from
me
as
a
schwarzbier
this
is
pretty
decent
probably
a
bit
too
heavy
for
the
style
though
the
delivery
is
consistent
and
thorough
but
in
the
end
like
i
said
its
a
bit
too
heavy
for
me
as
far
as
judging
to
style
this
is
a
style
that
breweries
rarely
try
out
so
nice
to
see
someone
trying
still
a
nice
beer
a
nice
beer
recommended
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
dark
lager
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
d
very
drinkable
very
nicely
balanced
with
a
nice
kick
at
the
finish
maybe
a
bit
too
roasted
for
the
style
but
i
am
really
enjoying
it
o
a
good
beer
nice
light
flavor
nothing
overpowering
yet
there
are
a
bunch
of
good
flavors
in
it
to
enjoy
this
one
was
an
easy
drinking
good
beer
although
im
still
hungry
o
this
is
a
light
schwarzbier
a
style
i
have
hardly
visited
and
it
is
not
bad
but
not
great
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
it
is
refreshing
having
this
off
tap
if
even
an
option
i
am
sure
would
be
slightly
fresher
with
some
more

shorts
overall
this
is
all
right
at
best
in
terms
of
barrel
aged
beers
it
does
not
stack
up
well
though
this
was
nice
a
well
balanced
and
flavorful
schwarzbier
here
that
i
would
consider
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
a
6
abv
dark
beer
shorts
did
right
by
the
style
with
this
one
thanks
hurfer
for
the
opportunity
o
surprised
by
how
good
this
was
a
tremendous
flavor
profile
i
wouldnt
need
many
of
these
but
i
would
search
this
out
again
to
have
occasionally
strikes
me
as
a
great
one
to
have
int
he
fall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
offering
nothing
fancy
but
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
not
heavy
as
the
name
would
suggest
o
overall
pretty
good
not
bad
for
a
beer
that
was
only
2
75
an
interesting
style
with
characteristic
especially
in
the
mouthfeel
category
that
im
not
used
to
44444
that
aside
it
tastes
good
but
will
probably
be
forgotten
the
flavor
is
malt
forward
with
a
light
roast
character
each
sip
brings
a
subtle
sweetness
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
a
decent
beer
and
one
id
try
again
overall
i
though
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
schwarzbier
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
this
style
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
was
my
favorite
schwarzbier
i
have
had
to
date
i
find
most
schwarzbiers
to
have
a
good
amount
of
hops
in
them
and
this
one
wasnt
hoppy
at
all
it
was
focused
on
the
roasted
and
smokey
malts
and
i
liked
that
it
had
a
very
rich
and
roasty
flavor
that
was
somewhat
similar
to
a
porter
but
every
thing
else
was
pretty
true
to
its
style
especially
the
mouthfeel
i
could
see
how
this
beer
would
make
a
great
choice
to
drink
with
dinner
the
flavor
is
roasted
and
robust
while
the
body
is
light
enough
to
not
be
too
filling
to
go
with
dinner
i
will
have
to
try
and
pair
this
beer
up
with
a
nice
dinner
next
time
i
have
it
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
it
would
represent
its
style
nicely
in
my
fridge
i
hope
there
is
some
more
left
at
the
store
so
i
dont
have
to
wait
till
next
year
to
enjoy
this
fine
brew
if
you
like
roasty
and
robust
beers
then
this
beer
is
for
you
it
has
great
drinkability
while
retaining
all
those
great
flavors
shorts
comes
through
with
another
great
beer
i
like
the
fact
they
can
take
an
often
overlooked
style
and
add
their
own
personal
touch
to
it
to
make
it
a
truly
unique
and
great
tasting

see
what
you
guys
can

more
along

lines

and
makes
for
an
easy
to
quaff
drank
chocolate
and
some
chalky
tones
with
a
modest
hop
bitterness
and
light
roasted
quality
are
the
main
notables
mouthfeel
is
around
medium
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
dance
across
my
face
it
does
go
well
with
food
and
i
feel
as
though
i
lived
the
label
being
totally
stuffed
on
alton
browns
artichoke
dip
recipe
and
this
here
schwarzbier
from
shorts
this
is
a
semi
sessionable
dark
bier
toward
the
heavy
end
of
the
spectrum
that
remains
true
to
style
as
it
circles
the
stout
and
porter
realm
but
never
goes
inside
thanks
pours
dark
definitely
a
black
bier
the
head
is
offwhite
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
lace
the
nose
is
full
of
caramel
dark
fruit
a
few
dabs
of
maltiness
scattered
about
the
taste
offers
up
some
coffee
vanilla
slight
roast
and
chocolate
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
overall
i
like
this
offering
from
shorts
very
drinkable
this
is
one
serious
schwarzbier
in
that
it
smells
and
tastes
a
lot
more
like
a
stout
than
anything
else
sustenance
is
a
good
name
because
it
is
much
more
filling
than
most
of
this
style
that
is
unfortunately
my
main
problem
with
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
too
robust
for
a
schwarz
but
not
quite
robust
enough
to
be
a
stout
or
porter
i
think
if
i
wanted
something
sessionable
i
would
pass
this
up
and
if
i
wanted
something
roasty
i
would
go
with
a
big
stout
it
is
still
a
quality
beer
though
and
is
yet
another
fine
offering
from
shorts
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
though
not
a
great
beer
im
glad
i
got
a
sixer
and
ill
enjoy
the
rest
of
it
one
of
the
stronger
examples
of
what
a
schwartzbier
can
be
this
one
is
really
worth
your
while
pretty
drinkable
with
no
overpowering
flavors
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
but
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
still
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around

pleasnat
and
comes
together
well
im
very
much
looking
forward
to
trying
the
barrelaged
version
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
certainly
did
not
dissapoint
in
any
way
would
do
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
d
much
better
not
as
chewy
as
theyd
lead
you
to
believe
but
a
warming
schwarzbier
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
lacking
for
me
due
to
the
shock
every
drink
has
on
my
tastebuds
drinkability
is
average
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
beer
i
was
just
left
wanting
more
appearance

really
black
with
a
thin

some

thats
kind
of

taste
is
roasted

maybe
some

mouthfeel
is
okay
astringent
and
drinkabilty
is
pretty
low

is

still

i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
absolutely
jet

then
a

thats
ok

note
wonderful
flavornice
mix
of

and
a

slight
trace
of
licorice
as
well
just
enough
hop
bite
to
balance
the
whole
thing
out
lingering
sweetness
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
while
it
lacks
the
overall
clean
crispness
of
a
lager
and
is
far
more
stout
like
to
me
this
is
one
damn
fine
beer
and
very
very
drinkable
almost
gone
in
3
large
sips

exactly
what
you
want

slight

not
something
i
would
search
out
for
myself
the
beer

a

and
a
white

the

is
roasted

coffee
burnt

dark

the

heavy
on

and
roasted

along
with
some

and
dark

notes
in
the
background
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
pretty
easy
drinking
i
dont
tend
to
like
smokey
beers
but
this
one
has
just
a
enough
of
it
to
make
this
enjoyable
only
real
negative
for
me
is
the
mouthfeel
but
that
might
be
because
im
used
to
the
body
a
stout
offers
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
d
it
goes
down
easy
enough
but
is
not
very
exciting
or
noteworthy
not
one
that
id
really
be
excited
to
find
again
but
not
that
bad
either
decent
beer
but
pretty
unmemorable
overall
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
or
youre
looking
for
a
schwarzbier
but
not
one
of
the
brewerys
best
offering
in
my
opinion
a
black
color
pour
with
a
small
off
white
head
medium
carbonation
spotty
and
jagged
lacing
aroma
is
caramel
and
roasty
grain
coffee
black
licorice
and
spicy
hops
flavor
is
very
roasty
lightly
sweet
lightly
bitter
with
some
roasty
maltcaramel
black
licorice
and
earthy
spicy
hops
medium
body
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
very
sessionable
and
very
good
nice
work
shorts
this
is
a
solid
drink
but
the
aftertaste
sits
heavy
on
my
tongue
minimizing
the
want
for
more
i
could
have
another
but
one
is
fine
overall
they
dont
mince
word
when
they
say
this
beer
is
like
a
meal
its
rich
bold
dark
et
al
its
not
necessarily
a
hot
summer
day
brew
yet
its
light
body
allows
for
easy
drinking
its
full
of
dark
flavors
that
would
be
great
for
a
bbq
think
of
it
similar
to
a
nice
black
stout
but
with
a
sweeter
profile
and
since
the
abv
wasnt
readily
available
im
guessing
it
has
a
fairly
low
since
im
getting
much
more
flavor
than
i
am
buzz
very
tasty
brew
the
first
sip
gave
me
roasted
malts
again
but
cleanly
so
balanced
by
hop
bitters
and
suggestions
of
burnt
caramel
that
fade
to
sweet
the
hops
have
a
nice
well
played
presence
here
balanced
with
the
sweet
and
the
bitter
of
the
malts
themselves
nothing
is
heavy
handed
there
is
a
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
but
just
a
tad
runny
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
great
overall
rather
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
pretty
tasty
and
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
creamy
very
sessionable
for
me
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
them
d
this
is
yet
another
beer
from
shorts
that
is
very
drinkable
the
flavors
blended
well
overall
this
would
be
a
couple
pints
and
then
move
onto
something
else
personally
a
great
beer
nevertheless
dthis
beer
got
better
as
it
warmed
i
started
out
with
it
from
the
fridge
and
didnt
think
much
of
it
at
first
but
by
the
end
it
had
a
respectable
taste
and
feel
and
turned
out
quite
tasty
nice
beer
really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
hopefully
there
will
be
some
more
shorts
in
my
future
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
but
if
it
were
readily
available
i
would
pick
it
up
from
time
to
time
deep
black
with
moderate
to
light
carbonation
that
forms
a
head
that
falls
to
a
ring
of
foam
no
lace
fairly
complex
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
burnt
caramel
and
smoke
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
dark
molasses
a
touch
of
burnt
caramel
finishes
with
roasted
chicory
and
espresso
tastes
moderately
to
lightly
hopped
most
of
the
bitterness
tastes
like
its
coming
from
the
malts
with
no
real
hop
flavor
fairly
complex
yet
highly
drinkable
overall
i
was
fearing
this
beer
would
very
sweet
upon
smelling
it
the
flavors
really
went
into
the
opposite
direction
once
it
hit
my
mouth
so
its
really
the
best
of
both
worlds
sweet
lush
and
thick
aroma
with
clean
drybitter
and
flavors
and
textures
i
dont
know
how
shorts
did
it
but
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
when
i
see
it
hats
off
to
the
shorts
crew
once
again
overall
one
of
the
better
black
lagers
ive
had
i
drank
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
orval
glass
the
beer
pours
a
light
black
with
a
ligh
tan
head
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
totally
dead
shows
off
only
light
chocolate
really
boring
the
taste
is
also
light
gives
a
little
smoke
and
chocolate
usually
i
want
more
taste
but
for
some
reason
i
like
this
a
light
roasty
porterish
type
beer
that
is
really
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
here
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
roasty
dark
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
call
very
drinkable
and
a
great
dark
beer
for
the
hot
summer
months
shorts
definitely
did
good
with
this
one
added
to
my
shopping
list
conclusion
tasty
beer
but
doesnt
really
live
up
to
the
way
its
packaged
up
in
kalamazoo
i
had
no
internet
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
style
this
was
supposed
to
be
from
the
title
and
description
i
was
thinking
stout
or
porter
on
here
its
listed
as
a
schwartz
and
quite
honestly
it
makes
a
lot
more
sense
and
probably
deserves
to
score
a
b
but
as
i
didnt
know
that
at
the
time
i
still
have
to
rate
it
at
a
b
drinkability
compared
to
other
dark
beers
id
say
this
one
fairs
pretty
well
enough
malt
and
bitterness
to
keep
you
interested
but
not
enough
to
prevent
this
from
being
a
decent
session
beer
d
very
good
but
only
because
it
is
so
damn
light
i
wouldnt
have
another
drinkability
not
too
shabby
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
got
a
great
mouthfeel
thats
top
of
the
line
and
big
bold
flavors
the
beer
for
when
youre
hungry
and
thirsty
rings
spot
on
thanks
much
jeff
d
definitely
happy
with
trying
this
and
you
should
too
great
effort
from
shorts
here
unique
dark
beer
very
much
black
and
very
much
good
d
an
interesting
beer
that
i
am
glad
to
have

please
of

quite

overall
the

surprisingly
average
take
on
the
style
by
shorts
perhaps
worthwhile
for
big
fans
of
the
style
but
i
didnt
think
there
was
anything
remarkable
here
i
had
this
on
tap
at
hopcat
in
grand
rapids
the
beer
was
black
color
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
was
light
and
malty
a
little
roasty
the
taste
was
dominated
by
roasted
malts
but
stayed
easy
drinking
with
a
light
body
very
good
schwarzbier
but
honestly
id
made
a
mistake
and
thought
i
was
ordering
a
rauchbier
good
though
nice
beer
very
unique
flavor
i
want
to
like
this
beer
its
a
real
tough
style
to
get
and
this
one
is
plentiful
but
i
cant
enjoy
it
too
bitter
for
me
with
a
very
awful
metal
taste
not
a
fan
overall
a
nice
sipper
good
flavor
kept
in
check
balanced
easy
to
enjoy
great
beer
my
first
time
having
it
my
friend
brought
me
a
case
when
i
ran
out
of
my
usual
beer
i
opened
up
a
bottle
and
took
a
sip
it
was
delicious
it
has
a
nice
cream
flavor
to
it
nice
black
charred
look
and
taste
great
for
watching
the
game
and
sipping
on
a
hot
day

q
my
review
overrall
outstanding
unfortunalty
its
not
for
sale
in
my
town
i
have
to
drive
a
ways
from
here
o
the
nice
clean
coffee
flavor
turns
thin
and
watery
and
there
are
no
other
flavors
to
support
it

overall
wow
this
is
surprisingly
delicious
a
great
balance
of
flavours
and
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
magic
hat
has
impressed
me
with
a
lot
of
their
beers
well
worth
trying
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
o
well
balanced
beer
and
the
smokiness
of
the
malts
makes
it
a
perfect
seasonal
many
of
this
style
lack
enough
flavor
but
this
one
delivers
good
stuff
a
black
lager
pours
well
black
medium
size
bubbles
a
little
lacing
smell
of
molasses
cocao
reminds
me
of
a
porter
taste
is
much
the
same
strong
chocolate
and
molasses
tones
a
bit
of
tobacco
too
leaves
a
clean
aftertaste
fades
quickly
very
light
mouthfeel
for
what
it
is
how
light
its
mouthfeel
is
almost
reminds
me
of
an
oatmeal
beer
like
the
poet
though
this
is
a
bit
sharper
solid
beer
for
what
it
is
though
a
little
underwhelmed
overall
o
a
pretty
fine
example
of
the
style
i
have
to
say
im
kind
of
impressed
magic
hat
in
my
past
experience
is
pretty
hit
or
miss
and
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
the
fore
but
it
is
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
as
a
session
brew
when
its
actually
out
as
opposed
to
on
the
sale
shelf
by
the
single
12oz
good
brew
overall
you
dont
see
many
schwarzbiers
and
this
one
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
porter
great
start
ends
up
just
pretty
good
which
means
that
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
this
one
out
again
though
definitely
would
have
another
if
the
opportunity
presented
o
overall
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
i
would
prefer
more
hops
in
a
beer
like
this
a
swell
offering
from
magic
hat
not
as
good
as
monchshof
or
kostritzer
but
very
close
o
a
good
tasting
and
smelling
beer
that
needs
to
add
some
body
andor
carbonation
for
me
to
want
to
come
back
simply
too
thin
o
pretty
good
when
i
comes
down
to
it
a
lot
better
than
most
of
the
american
interpretations
ive
tried
o
an
excellent
beer
by
magic
hat
i
can
imagine
enjoying
this
with
a
big
fat
steak
on
the
grill
this
is
a
world
class
beer
will
buy
again
next
time
around

schwarzbier

sometimes
called
black
pils
magic
hat
brewing
company
shows
why
it
is
not
as
hop
dominant
as
a
true
pilsner
but
a
great
germanstyle
lager
that
presents
a
full
range
of
flavors
without
being
burnt
overall
had
the
carbonation
not
been
so
intense
this
would
be
one
the
best
dark
beers
that
i
have
had
in
a
while
if
you
can
look
past
the
high
levels
of
carbonation
this
is
a
simple
yet
good
tasting
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
good
schwarzbier
better
than
sa
black
lager
in
my
opinion
good
job
by
magic
hat
poured
a
very
dark
color
but
not
quite
black
as
night
as
the
name
would
suggest
had
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
slowly
smell
was
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
very
pleasant
taste
was
good
and
much
like
aroma
and
i
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
was
just
a
tad
thin
in
my
opinion
still
i
enjoyed
this
very
sessionable
beer
and
would
drink
again
o
not
a
bad
black
lager
on
par
with
some
of
the
other
darker
brews
from
magic
hat
willing
to
buy
again
in
spite
of
the
subtitled
name
howl
isnt
quite
a
black
as
night
lager
dark
brown
to
black
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
edge
that
were
apparent
while
pouring
tan
head
bubbles
up
nicely
but
dissipates
quickly
in
spite
of
being
a
winter
lager
it
seems
a
bit
musty
in
the
nose
some
nice
roast
malt
mineral
light
off
spice
roast
continues
in
the
mouth
but
lacks
depth
or
a
layered
dimension
to
the
taste
and
is
a
bit
light
and
tasteless
off
the
back
not
bad
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
as
definitive
for
the
style
d
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
its
light
in
flavor
but
still
develops
plenty
of
tasty
roasty
character
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
especially
for
people
who
have
a
fixed
conception
of
dark
beers
as
heavy
overall
i
gave
the
beer
a
3
5
because
the
lack
of
foam
plus
it
was
terribly
sweet
and
not
complex
in
taste
i
expect
more
from
something
marked
seasonal
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
could
drink
these
in
lieu
of
the
dessert
course
after
a
dinner
mouthfeel
is
mediumtoheavy
bodied
with
high
carbonation
overall
not
too
bad
not
too
impressive
but
it
will
do
o
this
is
the
first
schwarzbier
that
i
can
remember
trying
and
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
solid
the
balance
of
hops
and
roasty
malts
in
combination
with
plentiful
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
make
this
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
brew
ive
been
in
the
mood
for
some
lighter
more
sessionable
beers
lately
and
this
one
certainly
satisfies
poured
into
my
moncshof
schwarzbier
pokal
a
deep
chocolate
color
with
a
ruby
tingea
thinner
but
well
sustained
light
tan
colored
head
atop
chocolate
aromas
really
stand
out
with
a
roast
uderneath
earthy
and
dry
on
the
palate
with
some
roasted
coffee
notes
intertwined
with
unsweetened
chocolateagain
not
much
sweetness
to
be
had
here
much
dryer
and
more
earthy
than
most
i
have
had
of
the
style
but
i
like
it
overall
this
one
is
very
drinkable
the
taste
isnt
amazing
but
its
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
without
any
offputting
flavors
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
not
as
black
as
the
bottle
claims
but
it
is
still
a
bit
darker
than
some
black
lagers
light
tan
head
that
fizzles
to
18
not
mindblowing

so
that
actually
is
a
good
thing
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
psukinger
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
i
went
into
this
beer
with
low
expectations
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
solid
black
lager
reminds
me
of
full
sails
session
black
lager
and
brings
back
fond
memories
of
buzzards
bay
black
lager
though
not
nearly
as
delicious
imo
not
bad
good
sessionable
beer
my
first
sip
was
a
huge
surprise
it
didnt
suck
not
only
that
but
it
was
an
excellent
beer
i
sucked
down
that
six
pack
in
no
time
this
is
another
black
lager
ive
enjoyed
and
now
i
can
say
that
the
only
magic
hat
beer
ive
had
is
one
ive
enjoyed
give
this
beer
a
try
i
doubt
youll
have
any
regrets
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
and
solid
schwarzbier
that
managed
to
stick
out
from
the
crowd
with
some
added
nutty
flavors
and
aromas
that
made
it
one
of
the
more
complex
schwarzbiers
i
have
had
to
date
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
it
has
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
while
going
down
very
smooth
and
not
being
too
filling
if
i
had
another
one
i
would
drink
it
i
could
maybe
do
four
of
these
in
a
session
without
getting
bored
with
it
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
pretty
much
everything
all
aspects
of
this
beer
seemed
to
be
right
where
they
should
be
there
wasnt
anything
about
this
beer
that
i
didnt
like
or
would
change
this
beer
doesnt
need
to
messed
with
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
nice
and
sessionable
black
lager
this
makes
for
a
good
darker
beer
to
have
with
dinner
and
it
paired
nicely
with
a
bowl
of
chili
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
the
extra
nutty
flavors
make
this
not
your
average
black
lager
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
i
dont
have
the
best
history
with
magic
hat
beers
but
this
proved
to
be
one
solid
schwarzbier
that
proved
to
be
pretty
unique
with
the
added
nutty
flavors
i
know
this
beer
isnt
a
traditional
take
on
this
style
but
it
comes
together
nicely
and
tastes
good
so
im
not
holding
that
against
them
if
you
are
leery
about
giving
magic
hat
another
try
man
up
and
try
this
beer
it
might
change
your
mind
about
this
brewery
this
isnt
my
favorite
schwarzbier
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
and
more
unique
ones
that
i
have
had
151st
not
black
as
night
but
pretty
close
and
near
opaque
which
is
quite
a
feat
for
a
beer
as
clear
as
this
smell
is
luscious
with
roasted
grains
cocoa
coffee
burnt
caramel
and
english
style
hops
earthy
and
mild
a
gentle
fruitiness
flows
through
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
big
charcoal
bitterness
dark
roasted
malt
and
smokey
grains
in
the
front
with
some
mild
sweetness
a
touch
of
soap
in
the
finish
before
more
char
and
leafy
hops
and
hop
oiliness
nice
chewy
feel
that
does
not
impede
drinkability
with
an
active
carbonation
a
very
nice
winter
session
ale
that
is
begging
for
big
smokey
meats
and
cheeses
smells
like
it
taste
delicious
if
you
like
coffeechocolate
malty
beers
this
is
for
you
smells
like
chocolate
but
taste
more
like
coffee
with
a
slight
and
i
do
mean
slight
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
an
all
around
good
beer
especially
during
those
colder
seasons
or
after
dinner
when
you
just
want
a
drink
instead
of
dessert
o
nice
beer
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
black
lagers
very
good
give
it
a
go
pours
a
nice
dark
ruby
color
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
really
has
a
forward
coffee
aroma
with
some
caramel
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
balanced
but
i
personally
feel
like
coffee
comes
to
the
forefront
not
as
aggressive
as
sam
adams
black
and
brew
as
previously
mentioned
the
coffee
is
there
but
also
some
nice
burnt
malt
finished
by
a
nice
slight
bitterness
delicious
very
sessionable
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
on
par
with
other
schwarzbiers
not
thick
like
a
stout
much
thinner
would
drink
this
again
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
o
decent
for
the
style
however
this
is
a
meal
beer
too
heavy
for
me
and
with
the
low
abv
i
was
confused
why
it
felt
as
heavy
as
it
did
overall
i
liked
this
i
have
been
on
a
black
ipa
search
lately
so
it
was
nice
to
have
this
black
as
night
lager
not
an
ipa
or
even
an
ale
but
a
tasty
brew
blows
guinness
black
lager
out
of
the
water
thanks
to
smason
for
this
extra
pours
a
very
deep
shade
of
brown
with
large
frothy
beigetan
head
head
sadly
reduces
quickly
though
aroma
of
spiced
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
coffee
and
hops
perfectly
balanced
good
feel
on
the
tounge
warming
and
welcome
its
light
and
drinkable
slightly
over
carbonated
but
a
tastey
brew
o
a
solid
schwarzbier
that
could
stand
in
for
a
porter
or
stout
on
a
cold
night
easily
sessionable
at
4
6
too
o
good
o
overall
this
is
not
bad
at
all
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
magic
hat
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
one
of
those
where
you
want
to
have
plenty
on
hand
before
you
open
the
first
bottle
o
this
is
pretty
good
appearance
left
something
to
be
desired
but
it
tasted
good
and
had
a
great
mouthfeel
poured
into
a
13oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
thin
looking
black
with
one
inch
light
tan
head
minimal
lace
smell
some
dark
malts
chocolate
hints
of
coffee
some
piney
hops
and
a
little
biscuit
taste
is
exactly
like
its
smells
plenty
of
flavor
for
its
small
abv
makes
its
sessionable
body
is
small
for
a
winter
beer
enough
carbonation
and
very
easygoing
down
not
what
i
was
expecting
this
time
of
year
but
no
regrets
o
i
was
skeptical
from
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
blew
me
away
o
i
get
a
lot
of
coffee
notes
from
this
beer
odd
to
me
for
a
schwarzbier
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
have
not
had
too
many
magic
hat
beers
that
i
like
but
this
one
is
something
i
would
buy
again
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
it
just
feels
too
watery
the
slight
smokey
flavor
is
a
nice
finishing
touch
to
the
burnt
bitter
chocolate
but
im
glad
i
bought
only
one
bottle
overall
appearance
is
a
let
down
smell
is
wonderfully
rich
and
makes
me
want
to
indulge
in
a
sip
i
love
beers
with
an
earthly
scent
taste
is
pretty
good
this
is
my
first
time
having
it
out
of
a
glass
i
have
had
this
before
and
enjoyed
it
more
out
of
the
bottle
odd
despite
the
look
and
flavor
it
does
not
sit
too
overly
heavy
goes
down
easily
i
would
get
this
again

a
black
beer
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
smells
like
black
rye
bread
and
chocolatey
roasted
malt
taste
and
a
light
body
aftertaste
lingers
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
coats
the
tongue
stings
the
palette
a
little
bit
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
not
disappointed
i
would
recommend
this
if
you
are
a
fan
of
porters
o
overall
a
decent
schwarzbier
had
this
right
after
the
guinness
black
lager
and
this
was
very
slightly
better
worth
checking
out
would
probably
have
it
again
pours
pretty
dark
but
not
black
more
a
very
deep
brown
head
retention
has
been
amazing
smells
heavily
of
charcoal
leather
and
bitter
coffee
not
the
most
appetizing
of
scents
medium
to
light
in
body
with
some
toffee
caramel
and
chocolate
tastes
present
but
coffee
flavor
dominates
the
beer
once
it
finishes
i
dont
know
what
to
pin
point
about
the
beer
exactly
that
i
dont
like
but
im
not
liking
it
might
be
the
flavors
possibly
if
they
were
a
bit
subdued
itd
be
alright
but
the
flavors
present
in
this
beer
arent
the
flavors
i
wanna
be
punched
in
the
face
with
this
is
like
most
shwarzbiers
ive
had
but
probably
on
the
good
end
of
them
it
had
a
nice
rich
color
dark
and
a
nice
head
creamy
bodied
with
just
enough
carbonation
it
smelled
nice
toasty
and
caramelized
taste
was
similar
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
coffeelike
overall
this
is
just
good
great
in
the
winter
final
thoughts
after
having
some
magic
hat
brews
in
the
past
ive
dont
think
ive
ever
been
more
then
eh
with
them
this
is
is
great
but
the
body
might
be
a
little
too
heavy
for
the
style
but
i
dont
mind
one
bit
i
really
lucked
out
for
this
one
it
was
just
being
put
up
on
the
shelf
when
i
got
it
and
it
is
perfect
for
this
deep
fall
very
early
winter
time
magic
hat
impressed
me
with
this
one
tons
of
flavor
and
youll
be
able
to
drink
a
couple
no
problem
youve
got
to
give
this
one
a
shot
poured
a
1
light
mocha
head
with
moderate
life
dark
burnt
umber
brown
color
black
enough
smell
is
very
mild
just
a
little
roasted
malt
taste
is
like
a
very
weak
porter
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
body
is
quite
light
id
even
call
it
watery
to
me
this
is
ok
but
its
not
a
standout
overall
although
this
is
a
little
sweet
for
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
in
this
beer
and
it
is
one
of
the
few
beers
from
this
brewery
that
i
would
seek
out
again
pours
out
jet
black
one
finger
tan
head
that
fizzled
out
into
nothing
in
less
than
a
minute
body
is
somewhat
thin
and
watery
smells
of
roasted
malt
notes
first
and
foremost
mild
weak
bitter
chocolate
tones
and
thats
really
all
i
get
out
of
this
one
tastes
of
mild
roasted
malt
tempered
with
a
finish
of
spiced
hop
tones
overall
i
just
wish
the
body
was
a
bit
more
robust
on
this
one
for
my
taste
it
comes
across
as
only
a
forgettably
average
schwarzbier
there
are
worse
and
there
are
better
brews
than
this
one
poured
into
a
klokke
roeland
globe
coffee
brown
and
nearly
opaque
with
a
pinkyfinger
of
tannish
head
that
receded
to
a
patchy
layer
small
blotches
of
lacing
here
and
there
light
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
grains
a
little
on
the
metallic
side
up
front
the
taste
is
a
mixture
of
sweet
molasses
and
roasted
malts
turning
midpalate
to
a
bitter
coffee
with
lots
of
graininess
and
a
bit
of
smoke
medium
mouthfeel
and
quite
dry
nothing
great
but
not
too
bad
overall
o
complex
and
flavorful
this
is
a
great
fall
session

maybe
i

this
a

cold
as
it
tasted
better
the
warmer
it
got

is
lightmedium
its
a
bit

and

i
liked
this
brew
it
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
pretty
decent
for
1
79
a
single
bottle
worth
a
try
and
id
buy
this
again
i
was
very
surprised
with
this
beer
since
i
dont
always
enjoy
magic
hat
but
they
must
have
used
a
different
yeast
on
this
beer
overall
i
wish
they
sold
this
by
itself
o
a
well
balanced
and
sufficiently
unique
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
dark
and
you
dont
plan
on
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
this
is
a
great
choice
i
could
imagine
pairing
this
with
a
savory
winter
stew
or
chili
and
being
delighted
by
the
complimentary
flavors
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
decent
offering
for
a
lighter
winter
option
a
bit
hard
to
swallow
because
of
the
carbonation
despite
its
light
body
o
a
pretty
solid
american
rendition
of
a
classic
style
if
you
ask
me
i
know
magic
hat
gets
a
bumb
wrap
from
the
craft
brew
crowd
but
for
a
4
6
brew
this
thing
packs
some
roast
and
smoke
flavors
i
will
session
with
this
every
year
if
its
made
available
and
so
far
its
been
two
years
in
a
row
rock
on
howlers
this
does
not
make
up
for
the
fact
that
they
killed
of
heart
of
darkness
a
while
back
but
ill
take
this
for
now
damn
good
stuff
here
overall
this
is
a
a
decent
if
average
schwarzbier
slightly
hoppier
and
more
american
in
the
flavor
than
other
more
treaditional
german
examples
but
a
decent
take
on
the
style
nothing
to
seek
out
and
definitely
not
a
must
try
but
decent
enough
if
its
all
you
find
in
your
friends
fridge
during
a
holiday
party
i
really
like
this
beer
its
light
yet
dark
and
flavorful
one
of
the
better
schwartzbiers
ive
enjoyed
i
was
recommended
by
two
people
to
try
this
something
finally
worth
trying
from
magic
hat
as
of
late
they
really
have
been
putting
out
some
mediocre
brews
except
for
this
dark
lager
even
if
you
feel
you
have
been
screwed
over
by
magic
hat
and
turned
your
back
away
from
them
give
this
beer
a
try
it
reminds
me
of
a
porter
but
not
bitter
o
a
good
schwarzbier
one
of
magic
hats
better
offerings
pours
a
nearly
black
chestnut
color
with
a
head
that
initially
crests
the
top
of
my
glass
before
settling
to
a
fluffy
cap
mild
roasted
malt
aroma
with
some
lager
yeast
and
a
clean
sweetness
smooth
mellow
malty
lager
flavor
nutty
with
a
bit
of
dark
bread
but
very
simple
and
clean
light
bodied
a
decent
inoffensive
stab
at
the
style
once
again
magic
hat
makes
a
beer
that
gets
close
but
fails
before
the
finish
overall
this
is
the
first
schwarzbier
that
ive
had
and
i
do
like
the
style
you
wouldnt
expect
such
a
dark
beer
to
have
both
flavor
and
easy
drinkability
its
like
the
best
of
both
worlds
i
would
definitely
pick
it
up
this
winter
if
you
get
the
chance
reviewed
from
notes
in
deed
poured
black
as
night
with
the
smell
of
malt
poured
into
a
pint
glass
taste
of
malt
with
a
slight
coffee
after
taste
before
finishing
clean
this
reminded
me
of
a
bock
really
bought
this
along
with
the
more
common
9
from
magic
hat
in
order
to
try
two
different
styles
from
the
same
company
in
one
night
at
a
recent
gathering
wfriends
got
to
have
this
up
at
the
brewery
before
it
was
even
released
a
few
years
ago
kind
of
exciting
i
thought
the
beer
poured
out
really
dark
even
for
being
a
sampling
glass
the
light
that
could
get
through
just
gave
off
a
red
hue
inside
the
glass
the
head
was
thin
but
has
a
light
brown
color
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
lot
like
a
german
lager
with
some
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
in
the
mix
the
taste
of
the
beer
gave
off
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
dark
malt
flavors
it
had
a
good
bitterness
to
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
which
i
thought
was
impressive
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
i
got
to
have
it
again
from
the
bottle
and
it
was
still
pretty
good
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
but
quickly
fades
to
a
sweet
caramel
that
lingers
after
each
sip
easy
to
drink
decent
flavor
and
it
goes
down
fairly
easily
i
just
probably
wouldnt
go
for
more
than
a
few
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
light
carbonation
and
a
medium
to
heavy
body
medium
drinkabiity
as
with
most
winter
warmer
types
but
a
very
good
beer
overall
the
nose
is
mineraly
and
herbal
with
just
undertones
of
malt
and
roast
the
flavor
delivers
a
bit
more
malt
and
roast
in
the
form
of
some
burnt
toast
notes
mineral
and
herbal
notes
border
on
metallic
but
stop
short
of
unpleasantry
there
is
some
unsweet
cocoa
or
chicory
astringency
that
develops
but
overall
the
brew
mostly
stands
out
as
moderately
refereshing
and
easily
drinkable
slightly
bitter
and
well
balanced
black
body
with
quick
dissipitating
foamy
head
mild
roasty
aroma
carbonation
is
right
there
and
it
is
appropriate
decent
roastiness
mild
coffee
minimal
alcohol
this
sessionability
is
appreciated
o
given
its
low
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
packs
in
a
lot
of
flavor
when
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
dark
as
night
with
a
one
finger
white
head
to
it
the
nose
picks
up
a
little
chocolate
and
some
coffee
notes
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
and
some
toffee
and
just
a
little
bitter
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
beer
has
a
smooth
mouth
feel
and
overall
is
a
good
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
to
drink
regularly
its
not
bad
but
ill
pass
next
time
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
nonic
pour
was
midnight
black
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
was
full
of
coffe
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
full
of
light
roasted
coffee
and
light
chocolate
dry
finish
the
body
is
light
well
carbonateed
a
nice
black
lager
a
nice
amber
brownish
murky
pour
with
a
off
white
head
that
has
some
consistency
but
you
can
tell
is
a
lager
nose
is
toasty
and
chocolate
the
palate
sit
in
the
realm
but
doesnt
have
a
dense
one
dimensional
quality
to
it
is
actually
somewhat
broad
some
apple
and
toasted
malt
and
chocolate
a
bit
of
a
grit
mineral
of
chalk
but
the
carbonation
is
good
and
the
beer
is
a
proper
form
from
being
to
end
ok
beer
fairly
bland
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
for
style
and
a
little
biting
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
for
a
stout
you
can
drink
a
good
amount
of
these
poured
from
growler
from
consumers
beverages
into
pint
glass
nice
half
inch
head
appetizing
black
red
slight
malty
smell
the
taste
of
chocolate
is
much
stronger
than
the
smell
excellent
chocolate
malt
to
go
with
the
contrast
of
a
lighter
lager
mouthfeel
a
very
new
easy
drinking
smooth
feel
for
so
much
flavor
i
enjoyed
this
alot
magic
hat
is
a
session
brew
due
to
its
lower
abv
and
less
filling
lightermellow
flavor
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
magic
hat
howl
is
a
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
lager
with
a
thin
beige
film
that
leaves
good
lacing
it
appears
to
have
some
particles
in
it
chocolate
and
roast
are
prominent
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
sweetness
its
medium
maybe
mediumlight
bodied
and
smooth
the
finish
is
quick
light
and
dry
it
has
a
simple
almost
delicate
flavor
it
tastes
just
like
the
aroma
chocolate
and
roast
the
very
light
bitterness
at
the
finish
is
wooden
and
herbal
its
very
smooth
and
drinkable
pours
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
slight
lacing
left
on
the
glass
coffee
and
roasted
malt
aroma
with
no
distinctive
hop
present
fairly
low
bitterness
for
a
dark
beer
light
body
id
prefer
this
in
summer
flashiness
lingers
in
the
finish
fairly
average
beer
d
the
dark
color
is
deceiving
this
beer
is
much
lighter
in
flavor
than
its
appearance
might
suggest
the
smells
of
chocolate
and
the
hint
of
coffee
add
to
the
mystery
of
this
light
dark
beer
i
certianly
enjoyed
my
first
howl
and
it
helped
me
warm
up
after
an
afternoon
out
in
the
snow
im
a
fan
of
magic
hat
and
enjoyed
this
beer
i
hope
it
stays
a
winter
seasonal
brew
d
good
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
nothing
offensive
about
it
but
nothing
great
about
it
either
for
the
price
i
got
this
at
i
will
probably
go
pick
up
another
two
but
for
full
price
i
would
probably
pass
overall
i
really
was
surprised
and
enjoyed
this
beer
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
however
i
enjoyed
the
contrast
between
howl
and
9
with
some
wintery
mix
falling
outside
this
was
a
nice
warm
rich
beer
for
a
cold
evening
will
definitey
be
looking
out
for
this
seasonal
offering
next
fall
this
has
an
attractive
reddish
copper
color
clear
but
pretty
dark
the
head
is
solid
in
stature
and
a
light
oatmeal
color
with
fair
lacing
the
aroma
offers
malt
licorice
and
hints
of
blackberry
chocolate
firm
and
quite
pleasant
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
charcoal
and
light
chocolate
with
a
coffeegrass
hop
bite
that
ends
dry
to
the
tongue
a
bit
chalky
and
slightly
aqueous
though
closer
to
a
medium
body
brew
heartily
carbonated
maybe
a
bit
much
very
drinkable
very
interesting
and
perfectly
enjoyable
by
my
tastes
not
sure
if
this
is
quite
like
other
schwarzbiers
ive
had
sort
of
half
stout
and
half
porter
but
its
something
i
would
happily
drink
again
overall
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
and
found
it
enjoyable
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
drink
during
the
winter
time
and
during
the
times
where
you
just
want
to
relax
and
have
a
beer
in
the
cold
weather
d
my
first
shwarzbier
very
interesting
i
need
to
explore
the
style
more
d
a
little
too
full
bodied
to
drink
several
of
but
for
a
good
stand
alone
beer
this
one
is
solid
quite
surprised
with
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
and
how
much
it
strayed
from
what
ive
come
to
recognize
as
a
magic
hat
offering
aroma
is
mostly
roasted
malts
taste
has
the
same
sort
of
taste
plus
a
bit
of
caramellike
sweetness
small
amount
of
hops
smooth
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
and
only
4
6
abv
not
bad
compared
to
a
german
schwarzbier
this
probably
is
worse
but
there
arent
many
competitors
in
this
genre
id
try
it
again
i
cant
say
that
i
have
encountered
a
lot
of
schwarzbiers
over
the
years
but
i
like
this
one
its
not
something
to
write
home
about
but
it
is
very
good
dark
toasted
malt
mellows
to
burnt
embers
first
and
foremost
there
are
some
dry
hoppy
tones
lingering
in
the
background
but
they
are
as
elusive
as
ghosts
when
you
try
to
pin
them
down
a
little
more
carbonation
than
is
necessary
keeps
this
from
being
a
real
good
black
lager
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
another
very
good
schwarzbier
i
love
this
style
and
this
one
seems
like
a
very
good
interpretation
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
pours
dark
black
with
wisps
of
white
foam
on
tap
slight
roasted
barley
smell
but
otherwise
very
faint
smooth
roasted
taste
like
a
light
stout
some
coffee
notes
very
thin
mouthfeel
more
smooth
than
anything
quite
drinkable
lots
of
flavor
could
be
sessioned
d
all
night
drinkability
has
a
really
nice
flavor
and
lower
alcohol
content
that
makes
this
beer
one
that
can
be
enjoyed
all
night
im
impressed
drinkability
is
subpar
getting
down
a
glass
wouldnt
be
tough
but
it
would
be
boring
not
much
going
on
here
i
wish
magic
hat
would
focus
more
on
brewing
than
on
advertising
saw
this
at
the
store
and
figured
id
give
it
a
try
this
beer
was
just
plain
weird
to
me
it
almost
had
a
taste
like
artificial
ingredients
or
some
sort
of
flavoring
was
added
for
lack
of
a
better
term
it
taste
like
it
was
over
processed
if
you
can
even
say
that
about
beer
pours
dark
and
looks
great
but
drinking
it
makes
me
want
to
howl
for
my
money
back
i
had
several
other
beers
from
this
brewer
in
a
12
pack
sampleroffering
none
of
them
impressed
me
nor
will
i
waste
my
time
rating
them
i
know
i
wont
be
trying
anything
else
from
this
group
for
a
while
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
dimpled
mug
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
a
tall
small
bubbly
head
aroma
has
a
clean
lager
smell
with
notes
of
chocolate
malt
and
a
deep
toasted
and
roasted
malt
presence
flavor
has
an
early
dark
roasted
bite
moving
into
a
lightly
sweet
chocolate
malt
followed
by
a
very
nice
coffee
smoothness
and
finishes
with
full
combo
of
roasted
and
toasted
malt
notes
body
is
moderate
with
a
creamy
feeling
this
brew
wasnt
anything
special
when
it
was
cold
but
as
it
warmed
up
the
deep
roasted
and
toasted
malt
notes
really
brings
about
a
barrage
of
flavors
that
really
do
work
well
together
going
against
the
grain
on
this
one
and
dont
think
this
brew
reflects
the
high
rankings
as
portrayed
this
was
my
first
magic
hat
beer
in
almost
3
years
i
probably
wont
have
another
for
at
least
that
long
highly
drinkable
and
for
a
reasonable
price
i
enjoy
this
beer
over
their
9
during
the
winter
months
but
its
not
the
best
winter
warmer
ive
had
i
would
have
enjoyed
the
infusion
of
some
spice
as
it
is
their
winter

its

in

i
dont

another
one
or
at

another
one
this

i
might
have
to

a

try
it
over

with

only

drinks

with

around

on

i
cannot
quite

it
is

the
roasted

comes
out
straight

i
like
that
loads
of

a

it
competes
with

lager
for

really
wish
more

would
put
beers
like
this

sometimes
you
just
want
something
flavorful
but
still
nice
and
easy
to
drink
this
one
fits
the
bill
quite
nicely
definitely
worth
picking
up

you
know
its
a
lager
this
one
has
a
sweet

the
flavor

is
a
pleasure

drink

is
my

is

nice

but
id
like
prefer
them
to
branch
out
a

more
still
its

to
the

5445this
is
a
fantastically
easy
drinker
not
sure
on
the
abv
schwarz
is
just
such
a
nice
style
i
think
if
more
people
got
over
their
omg
a
daaark
beeer
fears
this
style
could
be
a
hit
it
is
so
enjoyable
to
both
the
enthusiast
and
the
layman
it
is
interesting
and
can
be
complex
enough
for
the
enthusiast
but
it
is
just
so
damn
smooth
rich
and
clean
for
the
layman
easily
approachable
ive
had
some
success
recommending
schwarz
to
folks
looking
to
get
into
nonlite
beer
for
those
reasons
rich
and
tasty
yet
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
wish
more
breweries
would
focus
on
this
style
this
is
the
session
beer
for
the
dark
beer
fan
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
dark
ruby
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
tan
head
it
smelled
like
roasted
barley
with
muted
caramel
and
coffee
and
some
smoke
it
tasted
like
roasted
coffee
and
burnt
barley
with
some
oak
and
smoke
it
was
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
overall
this
had
an
interesting
taste
that
was
heavier
and
smokier
than
expected
from
a
schwarzbier
almost
seemed
more
like
a
smoked
porter
to
me
it
had
decent
body
but
nothing
great
and
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
taste
wasnt
perfectly
clean
but
it
was
generally
enjoyable
given
the
limited
nature
of
this
beer
you
can
skip
it
without
worrying
about
missing
too
much
the
drink
is
mediumbodied
and
highly
quaffable
with
mild
carbonation
that
suits
the
brew
and
this
drinker
just
fine
an
excellent
firsttime
offering
that
i
hope
to
see
in
drs
rotation
again
drinkability
good
to
know
that
duck
rabbit
is
branching
out
i
missed
their
doppelbock
when
it
was
around
around
being
a
relative
term
as
duck
rabbit
kegs
only
occasionally
make
it
up
here
to
virginia
and
less
frequently
to
charlottesville
but
i
imagine
the
doppelbock
was
not
one
of
the
few
we
gotget
but
i
hear
that
in
addition
to
this
scwarzbier
theyll
be
bottling
their
doppelbock
next
year
as
well
as
adding
a
marzen
to
their
lineup
in
the
next
few
months
a
trio
of
difficulttoproperlypulloff
styles
from
the
dark
beer
experts
a
tagline
i
still
dislike
as
i
think
it
smacks
of
beer
stereotyping
but
i
digress
has
me
looking
forward
to
the
next
entry
kudos
duck
rabbit
d
the
smokiness
that
adds
to
the
taste
score
slightly
decreases
the
drinkability
by
the
end
of
the
beer
ive
had
enough
smoke
for
one
night
on
the
other
hand
that
makes
it
a
good
6pk
purchase
as
it
should
last
for
the
better
part
of
a
week
sampled
subsequently
on
tap
at
bierria
paradiso
dc
and
have
found
it
to
be
considerably
more
appealing
in
bottled
form
md
medium
to
full
bodied
carbonation
is
medium
drinkability
is
very
good
a
superb
schwarzbier
the
flavor
is
some
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
a
sharp
kick
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
roast
coffee
slightly
acidic
per
style
lighter
mouthfeel
with
a
sharpness
from
decent
carbonation
i
have
tried
about
five
other
us
brewed
swarzbiers
and
this
stands
out
as
being
much
darker
dr
style
less
chocolate
and
more
coffee
and
a
bit
hoppier
in
the
finish
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
dark
almost
opaque
black
with
a
decent
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
decent
amount
of
roasted
malts
dried
fruits
cocoa
and
slight
coffee
the
taste
is
a
nice
subtle
blend
of
roasted
malts
with
subtle
yet
present
coffee
cocoa
and
dried
fruits
with
a
decent
hop
backbone
the
beer
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
even
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
very
respectable
version
of
the
style
i
had
this
beer
at
the
release
party
in
raleigh
flying
saucer
the
coffee
and
caramel
on
the
nose
hits
pretty
well
and
gives
the
illusion
of
being
a
big
bold
stout
very
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
doesnt
go
away
too
quickly
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
and
i
did
not
percieve
it
to
be
a
big
bodied
beer
the
taste
was
of
coffee
caramel
and
very
crisp
like
a
certain
pilsners
ive
tasted
overall
this
beer
was
very
good
and
i
was
excited
to
be
one
of
the
first
to
try
it
at
the

overall
im
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
schwarzbier
however
this
beer
seems
to
fit
for
the
most
part
pretty
refreshing
and
not
completely
flavorless
opposed
to
the
season
suggestions
for
this
style
winter
i
think
this
beer
goes
great
on
a
warm
early
summer
night
mouth
carbonation
light
for
a
lager
which
really
allows
the
creaminess
of
the
malts
to
bloom
on
your
tongue
light
bodied
considering
its
strong
malt
presence
an
enjoyable
and
approachable
schwarzbier
the
roasted
character
doing
well
to
branch
out
spread
itself
around
my
experience
thus
far
with
this
style
has
unfortunately
mostly
been
with
thin
overly
lagery
versions
so
this
is
a
nice
surprise
fuller
but
still
a
lager
the
smoky
essences
not
totally
overriding
that
pours
opaque
black
with
minimal
head
the
aroma
has
a
nice
deep
and
dry
roasted
barley
note
followed
up
by
notes
of
pumpernickel
and
dry
lager
yeast
taste
starts
with
a
neutral
malt
flavor
and
quickly
becomes
intensely
roasty
the
roasted
notes
bring
on
smokey
flavors
towards
the
end
finish
is
clean
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
with
a
light
to
medium
body
overall
lots
of
flavor
packed
into
this
but
it
was
a
bit
one
note
would
have
nice
to
have
a
little
more
depth
to
all
of
the
roast
overall
maybe
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
other
than
easy
drinking
just
an
ok
beer
the
crack
was
followed
closely
by
an
inverted
glug
which
produced
two
fingers
of
thick
deeptan
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
allowing
light
penetration
only
near
the
top
of
the
glass
it
was
as
deeply
dark
as
raders
heart
must
have
been
to
commit
such
atrocities
nose
was
rich
with
a
smoky
chocolate
scent
like
a
liquid
dark
chocolate
bar
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
chocolate
taste
even
more
pronounced
on
the
tongue
than
it
had
been
on
the
nose
understated
hops
more
like
unspoken
this
was
very
sweet
especially
on
the
finish
and
between
that
and
its
4
abv
i
would
not
find
it
sessionable
hey
that
was
their
claim
not
mine
stylistically
i
have
no
problem
with
it
but
the
style
is
just
not
my
cuppa
meat
dig
where
wynkoops
schwarzbier
favors
boldness
and
alelike
roughness
its
a
bit
more
assertive
for
the
classic
taste
and
texture
of
schwarz
but
its
taste
is
firm
and
favorable
throughout
and
is
sure
to
appease
the
fans
of
dark
lagers
throughout
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
cola
like
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
notes
of
coffee
taste
is
a
much
stronger
coffee
some
malts
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
overall
wynkoops
created
a
great
session
beer
its
light
slick
flavorful
and
refreshing
the
biggest
problem
i
see
is
that
i
really
had
to
search
for
any
substances
in
the
first
swig
though
all
of
the
characteristics
of
something
great
are
here
theyre
so
subtle
that
the
beer
might
teeter
on
the
edge
of
blandness
a
decent
beer
that
i
found
mildly
enjoyable
on
a
crisp
fall
morning
a
great
schwarzbier
imo
full
of
malty
goodness
well
done
and
something
i
would
highly
recommend
it
might
be
worth
mentioning
that
in
my
experience
bottledcanned
beers
with
smoked
malts
tend
to
have
that
come
on
a
bit
stronger
than
a
draft
version
on
tap
id
say
that
the
smokiness
in
b3k
is
barely
perceptible

this

the
smell
this
beer
has
a
high
level

which
makes
for
a

crisp

clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
the
first
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
my
first
beer
from
wynkoop
nice
dark
lager
not
opaque

certainly
quite
dark

too
much

some

clean

thin
in
tastes
a
little
metallic
not
great
but
certainly
drinkable
on
tap
at
gaetanos
ive
also
had
this
at
the
wynkoop
so
i
didnt
hesitate
to
order
it
dark
black
color
smells
a
little
grainy
tastes
fine
and
reminds
me
of
full
sail
dark
black
lager
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
although
i
wish
the
smell
was
more
robust
d
a
nice
example
of
this
style
the
lightness
makes
this
an
easy
drinker
drinkability
is
ok
i
didnt
love
it
but
warmed
up
to
it
somewhat
after
an
offputting
first
sip
the
beer
feeling
light
which
is
what
was
expected
from
the
style
and
it
was
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
carbonation
feel
to
it
the
beer
finished
with
a
dry
aftertaste
overall
not
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
would
have
again
but
not
my
first
pick
at
wynkoop
this
falls
somewhere
between
a
pilsner
and
a
porter
if
that
makes
any
sense
somewhat
similar
to
1554
but
with
a
more
assertive
spicy
hop
character
dark
brown
color
small
head
moderate
carbonation
minimal
aroma
slightly
roasty
not
much
else
fairly
sweet
caramel
to
start
some
coffee
roasty
flavors
chocolate
through
the
middle
finish
is
lightly
roasty
easy
to
drink
good
mouthfeel
ethanol
light
drinkability
had
only
read
about
these
beers
so
i
was
surprised
at
its
drinkability
the
body
is
light
but
leaves
a
sweet
finish
sweet
but
still
feels
full
attenuated
hard
to
explain
i
guess
some
silkiness
and
a
very
light
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
a
schwartz
not
really
recommended
d
this
beer
has
nice
big
malt
flavors
with
some
fruity
ale
qualities
but
it
still
has
a
very
smooth
quality
to
it
nice
session
beer
malt
aromas
some
roasted
grain
smell
but
not
the
smokiness
i
was
expecting
flavor
was
malty
somewhat
complex
but
not
overly
powerful
no
real
hop
taste
or
finish
in
this
one
thin
mouthfeel
kept
it
light
and
quite
drinkable
good
but
not
great
has
a
porterish
roast
coffe
aroma
with
mild
stewed
raisin
notes
that
are
more
baltic
porter
than
schwarz
but
hey
maybe
that
suggests
it
is
actually
a
lager
red
tinted
black
body
with
a
pinky
thin
tan
head
light
roasty
flavor
in
the
fore
amazingly
narrow
flavor
range
and
not
much
real
taste
concentration
or
or
presence
ont
he
tongue
a
watery
weak
porter
really
shameful
flavor
makes
this
super
drinkable
a
really
nice
schwartz
ordered
this
ontap
at
the
wynkoop
brewery
in
downtown
denver
poured
a
dark
black
hence
the
schwarz
german
for
black
color
nearly
opaque
little
offwhite
head
to
it
not
a
complex
flavor
or
aroma
mostly
hops
in
there
flavors
of
hops
linger
just
a
bit
then
fade
light
carbonation
good
for
sipping
amongst
the
beers
i
tried
at
wynkoop
this
one
wasnt
exceptional
although
it
wasnt
bad
by
any
means
i
would
definitely
try
another
pint
of
it
complex
malts
with
a
light
mouthfeel
made
this
one
appear
quite
drinkable
light
to
medium
bodied
very
smooth
with
good
drinkability
this
is
a
smooth
beer
with
lots
of
chocolate
its
tasty
and
easily
consumed
another
beer
i
picked
up
in
bottle
from
a
sampler
pack
was
really
good
surprising
that
my
wife
liked
it
too
very
nice
color
and
aroma
with
just
right
taste
and
balance
for
me
one
of
my
favorites
really
need
to
try
this
on
tap
pours
clear
deep
reddishbrown
color
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
some
minor
lacing
notes
of
caramel
and
burnt
coffee
with
a
mild
bitterness
full
flavored
without
being
heavy
excellent
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
it
might
be
good
for
a
cool
day
when
you
do
not
want
something
too
heavy
it
does
taste
light
for
such
a
dark
looking
beer
saranac
black
forest
brewed
by
matt
brewing
company
with
an
abv
of
5
5
this
brew
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
it
put
you
in
the
mind
of
black
coffee
the
smell
is
rich
with
sweetness
and
some
grains
the
taste
is
sweet
and
smooth
but
rich
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
black
forest
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
the
sweetness
in
this
brew
is
just
right
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
matt
brewing
company
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
overall
im
giving
this
4
5
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
a
3
5
for
saranac
black
forest
from
matt
brewing
company
i
may
buy
this
brew
again
o
i
think
this
has
some
sessionability
it
is
not
overly
complex
or
deep
i
think
i
could
kick
back
with
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
but
it
brings
a
little
something
different
to
the
table
o
a
decent
entry
level
beer
for
the
style
but
nothing
that
stands
out
like
i
said
it
really
could
really
use
more
alcohol
for
sure
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
probably
even
overrated
it
a
bit
o
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
with
nice
flavorsaromas
for
a
less
common
style
that
is
easily
accessible
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
one
i
could
have
a
couple
during
a
single
session
o
again
kind
of
disappointed
due
to
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
rated
high
i
will
try
the
other
that
came
with
the
12
beers
a
falling
variety
pack
maybe
itll
be
better
but
based
on
this
its
not
a
beer
id
buy
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
cheap
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
kills
a
decent
tasting
inmouth
beer
overall
not
something
i
would
buy
again
overall
a
decent
beer
overall
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
but
tasty
overall
very
dark
almost
a
purple
black
color
with
mild
carbonation
and
mild
head
toasted
dark
chocolate
malt
aroma
too
carbonated
chocolate
and
toasted
caramel
notes
for
taste
tastes
almost
like
a
light
chocolate
lager
balanced
mouthfeel
apart
from
the
carbonation
good
schwarzbier
a
simple
dark
lager
thats
good
for
drinking
a
few
the
flavors
and
complexity
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
still
pretty
flavorful
and
one
of
saranacs
best
beers
overall
im
a
little
disappointed
a
schwartzbier
can
be
very
simple
and
still
very
good
but
this
seems
to
flounder
a
little
it
doesnt
reach
deep
complexity
nor
does
it
stay
truly
crisp
and
brittle
either
direction
would
have
improved

okay
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
matts
tends
to
have
the
occasional
iffy
beer
their
consistency
is
sometimes
hap
hazard
and
i
think
that
might
be
the
case
here
o
a
solid
schwarzbier
no
attributes
are
over
the
top
but
it
holds
a
nice
color
and
a
decent
taste
a
good
dark
beer
to
take
a
break
with
if
drinking
some
heavy
hitting
stouts
wears
you
out
tastes
kind
of
like
a
dark
banana
bread
made
with
very
ripe
bananas
rye
bread
carameltoffee
malt
slightly
burnt
maple
syrup
mouthfeel
is
lightaverage
with
average
carbonation
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
schwarzbier
before
but
i
like
this
one
o
while
the
burnt
and
roasted
malts
are
a
minimal
element
and
though
flavors
these
are
a
staple
of
many
schwartzbiers
this
still
beer
works
well
as
is
black
forest
has
been
around
upstate
ny
on
tap
and
in
mix
packs
for
years
and
is
a
solid
mellow
winter
beer
picked
up
this
beer
randomly
in
the
liquer
store
not
bad
at
all
this
is
how
a
dark
beer
should
taste
nice
foam
and
really
dark
dark
colour
this
beer
is
german
style
for
sure
being
sweet
and
not
bitter
different
styles
here
either
sweet
or
bitter
i
prefer
sweet
but
that
is
of
course
matter
of
preference
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
o
definitely
worth
trying
captures
roasty
chocolate
and
caramel
qualities
while
at
the
same
time
remaining
thirst
quenching
because
of
that
it
is
a
great
dark
offering
for
the
summer
months
this
very
dark
beer
has
actually
a
very
dark
red
tone
against
the
light
and
looks
really
elegant
the
smell
is
an
obvious
caramelized
malt
with
wellharmonized
hops
i
can
say
the
same
for
the
taste
where
you
also
see
in
the
background
some
characteristic
notes
from
darker
malts
chocolatecoffee
the
body
is
medium
and
the
aftertaste
relatively
short
leaves
us
with
a
delicious
and
subtle
hop
taste
great
dark
lager
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
but
nothing
i
was
shocked
by
like
their
other
brews
pretty
solid
but
not
astounding
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
it
was
good
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
from
a
saranac
adirondack
trail
mix
6pack
into
a
pilsener
glass
poured
a
beautiful
deep
garnet
red
with
a
halffinger
head
that
dissipated
quickly
with
little
to
no
lacing
tastes
very
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
watery
but
smooth
mouthfeel
fairly
weakbodied
but
its
a
schwarzbier
not
a
porter
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
absolutely
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
too
bad
the
mixed
6
pack
only
came
with
one
of
them
overall
great
aroma
a
bit
thin
and
lacking
on
taste
gets
creamy
in
the
middle
but
fades
could
use
a
bit
more
toastroast
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
so
smooth
it
leaves
me
scratching
my
head
in
amazement
overall
quite
enjoyable
subtle
flavors
but
an
overall
easy
drinker
a
very
nice
sessionable
black
lager
here
a
party
pleasing
dark
brew
that
can
be
approached
and
enjoyed
by
all
fans
of
beer
good
stuff
here
o
lighter
and
less
flavorful
than
i
expected
it
would
be
and
would
have
preferred
but
the
benefit
is
that
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
one
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
not
be
weighed
down
poured
a
1
5
mocha
head
with
medium
lifespan
the
body
is
a
deep
but
clear
burnt
umber
brown
alas
my
sample
really
doesnt
smell
of
anything
at
all
even
after
full
room
temperature
the
taste
is
a
watery
lager
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
theres
not
much
of
a
finish
to
me
this
is
what
you
get
when
you
go
for
a
look
to
a
beer
instead
of
just
brewing
to
see
what
you
get
ive
had
this
beer
countless
times
on
tap
and
bottle
this
review
is
from
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
hf
wine
glass
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
slight
off
white
head
very
malty
slightly
roasted
aromas
taste
is
very
nice
fruity
malt
but
very
mild
great
brew
from
saranac
an
all
time
classic
go
to
brew
for
me
o
nice
dark
beer
a
little
light
for
my
taste
but
good
very
fruity
for
the
style
had
a
nice
roundness
of
roast
and
bitter
to
battle
the
sweetness
decent
mouthfeel
too
not
bad
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
out
pretty
good
for
one
of
those
light
dark
beers
overall
a
solid
beer
for
saranac
that
ive
been
enjoying
for
years
consistent
light
and
drinkable
m
light
to
medium
bodied
and
pretty
effervescent
dry
finish
pours
a
dark
brown
with
copper
edges
the
half
finger
of
beige
head
does
not
linger
very
long
the
nose
has
a
touch
of
roast
the
dominant
flavor
is
light
roasted
malts
with
a
nice
tingling
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
is
a
respectable
offering
but
not
an
extraordinary
example
of
this
lager
style
i
feel
all
dark
beers
should
be
drunk
in
the
european
manner
room
temprature
and
in
a
pint
glass
i
think
it
brings
the
maximum
amout
of
flavor
to
the
drinker
this
beer
proved
my
belief
is
correct
this
beer
has
made
my
buy
list
and
will
continue
to
be
a
choice
for
serving
guests
drinkability
this
beer
is
definitely
repeatable
and
would
make
a
decent
if
unusual
session
beer
the
body
should
be
a
little
heavier
to
support
the
taste
its
a
good
but
not
great
example
of
its
style
but
nothing
really
stands
out
nonetheless
its
easy
to
drink
and
presents
good
value
for
the
money
ill
buy
it
again
o
meh
not
bad
but
not
amazing
either
not
something
that
i
would
likely
seek
out
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
black
as
the
name
implies
the
beer
poured
a
nice
tan
head
but
it
did
not
hang
around
long
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
just
okay
i
thought
it
smelled
a
little
sour
at
first
the
taste
was
nice
a
little
sweet
kinda
caramelly
but
not
too
much
i
liked
and
will
buy
again
o
the
big
presence
of
fruits
in
this
beer
was
quite
surprising
to
me
i
really
dont
think
its
a
bad
thing
though
as
i
found
the
aroma
and
taste
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
theres
a
lot
of
sweetness
in
this
beer
that
while
it
didnt
turn
me
off
would
prevent
me
from
having
too
many
of
these
in
succession
overall
i
think
this
beer
really
stands
out
within
the
style
and
is
one
that
id
like
to
have
again
in
the
future
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
black
with
a
very
small
brown
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
and
disappears
entirely
has
a
strong
fruity
smell
with
not
much
of
a
hint
of
malt
or
hops
has
a
slight
malty
taste
but
the
fruity
taste
does
dominate
carbonation
is
perfect
and
goes
down
smooth
with
no
aftertaste
or
ill
tastes
overall
a
little
above
average
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
a
little
too
sweet
and
out
of
balance
overall
decent
worth
getting
in
the
trail
mix
6pack
oa
very
good
beer
from
a
great
brewing
company
definitely
one
worth
trying
overall
this
is
a
very
average
beer
at
best
due
to
it
lacking
in
so
many
departments
by
far
my
favorite
of
saranacs
yearround
offerings
pours
a
barely
see
through
dark
redblack
color
almost
purple
with
a
nice
head
german
malts
are
present
in
the
flavor
and
a
sharp
yeast
nose
peaks
my
interest
taste
is
old
world
bavarian
dark
beer
to
me
drinkably
malty
old
and
refined
in
character
roasty
but
not
heavy
i
like
it
a
lot
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
but
this
is
a
good
representation
of
what
saranac
is
capable
of
overall
i
picked
up
a
mixed
six
pack
from
saranac
and
this
was
probably
my
least
favorite
out
of
all
of
them
good
brew
but
not
my
favorite
o
good
for
the
style
and
good
for
me
feels
great
great
body
overall
because
i
cant
find
it
all
the
time
only
in
cases
and
its
not
as
dark
or
aromatic
as
german
counterparts
but
would
enjoy
it
again
if
i
could
o
very
drinkable
ticks
me
off
that
they
apparently
only
sell
it
in
their
adirondack
trail
mix
although
i
found
out
that
they
do
indeed
sell
this
beer
in
cases
depends
on
your
local
beer
store
o
this
would
be
a
great
desert
beer
for
a
schwarzbier
dark
ale
this
beer
is
as
good
as
ive
seen
for
a
mid
level
brewery
this
is
a
refeshing
high
end
style
beer
12oz
bottle
pours
a
black
color
with
dark
brown
hues
and
almost
no
head
no
lacing
aroma
is
earthy
with
caramel
malts
taste
is
more
of
the
earthiness
paired
with
the
caramel
malts
a
bit
bready
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
near
the
end
somewhat
sweet
very
tasty
and
drinkable
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
saranacs
best
offerings
overall
worth
grabbing
often
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
an
excellent
schwarzbier
i
generally
feel
that
the
saranac
line
is
hit
or
miss
but
luckily
black
forest
is
not
a
misfire
just
as
good
as
some
of
the
classic
german
schwarzbiers
wont
be
thinking
about
it
the
morning
after
pours
a
rich
brownishblack
tannish
head
smell
is
nice
roasted
caramel
malts
taste
blended
well
with
perfumy
sweet
hops
finishes
tight
and
dry
decent
fullbodied
brew
overall
a
very
unique
beer
and
style
and
saranac
pulls
it
off
quite
well
one
of
the
bolder
flavored
beers
in
their
quiver
overall
this
beer
has
a
delightful
nose
the
taste
is
also
pretty
good
the
appearance
is
right
inline
with
whats
expected
of
this
style
the
mouthfeel
was
the
detracting
part
of
this
beer
it
needs
to
be
heavier
however
it
is
an
all
round
good
beer
i
will
try
this
one
again
sometime
notes
first
had
this
beer
beer
a
decade
ago
not
sure
why
i
waited
so
long
to
go
back
this
is
a
tasty
nicely
made
lager
full
of
richness
inviting
flavors
which
seem
feel
like
brownies
in
the
oven
made
with
dark
chocolate
and
walnuts
will
rotate
in
for
the
fall
sweet
rather
than
bitter
with
just
a
tang
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
nice
brew
for
a
wet
autumn
day
my
first
foray
into
the
diverse
world
of
saranac
bottle
with
best
by
jan
2012
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
duvel
tulip
nice
brown
frothy
head
dark
almost
black
color
nice
lacing
smell
was
mostly
smoked
malt
some
smoke
and
mild
hops
the
taste
was
light
not
as
heavy
as
youd
think
with
the
color
website
said
to
pair
with
mexican
so
i
had
a
taco
with
it
nice
match
mouthfeel
was
light
and
easy
drinking
pretty
good
stuff
almost
like
a
porter
o
i
dont
understand
the
subpar
reviews
on
this
one
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
very
nice
especially
for
the
price
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
of
everything
to
really
thicken
up
the
flavor
profile
although
i
am
not
as
familiar
with
the
style
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
lot
more
flavor
for
its
style
in
comparison
with
other
saranac
beers
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
and
for
the
low
price
the
variety
12
packs
often
go
on
sale
for
about
12
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
this
is
not
a
familiar
style
and
you
want
to
try
something
new
d
refreshing
flavorful
and
oh
so
drinkable
nice
full
of
character
malt
base
with
good
depth
i
especially
like
the
dark
fruit
note
avoids
the
temptation
of
too
much
roast
instead
it
focuses
on
lighter
malts
good
amount
of
sweetness
but
not
at
all
heavy
nicely
to
style
and
quite
approachable
i
really
like
saranac
and
this
was
an
ok
offering
from
them
it
was
certainly
true
to
the
schwarzbier
style
and
extremely
sessionable
perfect
for
working
out
in
the
yard
on
a
cool
autumn
evening
oremember
having
magic
hats
and
sam
adams
from
last
year
but
there
is
a
lack
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
compared
to
those
this
beer
is
highly
consistent
all
around
it
reminds
be
strongly
of
sprecher
black
bavarian
for
a
heavy
dark
beer
with
some
flavor
to
it
but
without
the
extremes
of
a
russian
imperial
this
will
do
the
job
admirably
poured
into
my
pint
glass
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
slight
redness
a
big
bubbly
head
about
an
inch
high
forms
but
it
trickles
down
to
only
a
ring
around
the
glass
nose
is
light
with
some
toasty
dark
malts
and
some
hints
of
piney
hops
taste
is
thinned
out
roasted
barley
and
subtle
metallicbakers
chocolate
twang
the
metallicchocolate
flavor
gets
nearly
drowned
out
almost
instantly
by
an
earthy
pine
bitterness
nothing
to
complex
or
outstanding
but
it
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
good
amount
of
over
the
course
of
a
night
not
terrible
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
more
after
the
beer
warmed
and
all
the
different
malt
flavors
were
able
to
come
through
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
nutty
brown
highlights
the
beer
carries
a
tall
chunky
dense
chocolate
milk
colored
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
and
does
not
linger
a
bit
the
nose
is
a
tangy
sweet
with
a
honey
character
and
slight
sour
tone
flavors
are
dark
fruit
sweet
with
bits
of
currant
and
black
cherry
and
a
heavy
dose
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
on
the
tail
very
interesting
blend
of
flavors
aftertaste
is
light
and
mostly
chocolate
and
fruit
the
finish
is
light
and
smooth
interesting
twist
of
flavors
and
an
interesting
brew
overall
fluffy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
not
heavy
o
a
great
craft
from
a
great
company
who
rarely
if
ever
will
break
your
wallet
pours
near
black
with
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
that
falls
quickly
leaving
behind
a
thin
ring
of
lacing
some
spots
the
nose
carries
a
bit
of
light
roast
and
chocolate
everything
very
faint
flavor
has
just
a
touch
of
light
roast
mild
toffee
and
not
much
else
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
decent
enough
but
not
something
id
come
back
to
im
not
sure
about
the
lame
head
or
lack
of
aroma
from
the
tap
but
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
12
of
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
within
moments
leaving
a
nice
sheet
of
lacing
as
it
recedes
the
aroma
identifies
this
as
a
lager
with
some
chocolate
and
malt
scents
the
flavor
is
ok
malt
forward
with
light
roast
the
finish
brings
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
not
nearly
my
favorite
of
the
style
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
example
of
a
schwarzbier
d
sits
a
bit
heavy
but
generally
a
good
beer
nice
flavor
with
a
moderate
body
solid
b
brew
o
easy
to
drink
but
could
be
more
full
flavored
a
german
style
not
known
for
wild
and
crazy
antics
so
this
seems
in
keeping
with
a
tradition
maybe
a
better
quaff
in
a
big
stein
with
the
smell
of
sizzling
pork
nearby
o
not
a
bad
little
beer
here
but
i
would
have
enjoy
more
aromas
than
what
i
got
drinkability
this
has
been
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
my
mixed
six
so
far
however
this
is
not
available
locally
for
me
to
obtain
more
this
beer
pours
out
smoothly
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
deep
ruby
reddish
black
color
the
head
is
a
nice
shade
of
tan
the
lacing
didnt
really
exist
at
all
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
much
like
a
german
lager
with
just
a
little
bit
more
of
a
roasted
smell
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
good
has
a
strong
roasted
backbone
to
it
with
a
subtle
german
lager
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
isnt
heavy
at
all
for
a
dark
brew
overall
its
pretty
good
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
really
a
very
intresting
take
on
the
style
with
a
light
spiceness
that
really
made
it
stand
apart
this
beer
pours
with
a
small
light
head
over
a
deep
deep
ruby
liquid
the
smell
is
fruity
with
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
not
that
great
but
pretty
good
the
taste
doesnt
reflect
much
of
the
nose
the
maltyness
i
expected
to
translate
into
a
little
bit
more
full
flavor
but
the
caramel
was
mostly
gone
what
remains
is
fruityness
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
floral
hop
flavor
kind
of
nice
but
not
really
that
special
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
light
which
is
nice
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
nothing
super
special
but
definitely
something
that
would
be
nice
for
a
bbq
or
something
like
that
a
nice
brew
i
was
initially
unimpressed
with
their
ipa
so
this
was
a
nice
pickmeup
sweet
bready
but
not
oppressively
so
meaning
this
would
be
a
nice
session
brew
for
the
evening
low
abv
good
flavor
quite
nice
o
a
little
bit
weak
and
watery
at
the
end
my
new
favorite
beer
wish
i
could
find
it
in
other
than
a
variety
pack
i
found
bf
growlers
on
vacation
and
bought
a
whole
case
i
tend
to
enjoy
englishstyle
ales
but
theres
nothing
like
watching
a
hockey
game
with
a
few
bfs
would
very
much
like
to
try
it
fresh
from
the
tap
someday
overall
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
brew
that
was
quite
flavorful
and
left
and
very
satisfying
aftertaste
that
lingered
on
the
taste
buds
but
not
for
to
long
drinkability
delicious
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
back
and
feel
all
sorts
of
creamy
inside
great
mellow
finish
i
would
like
to
try
this
in
the
fall
seasons
a
deep
cola
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
and
sits
of
lace
here
and
there
smell
is
caramel
and
malt
with
a
soft
fruitiness
nice
roasted
grain
body
as
well
sweet
caramel
and
light
smokiness
are
followed
by
a
mild
dark
fruit
blend
and
very
dry
hop
finish
a
bit
of
lactic
sourness
superbly
balanced
with
a
quenching
feel
and
softly
active
carbonation
weight
is
just
a
little
heavy
for
a
lager
with
a
touch
of
syrup
drinkability
is
top
shelf
another
great
winter
and
fall
session
beer
from
matt
brewing
overall
be
carefull
cause
you
could
easily
enjoy
this
a
little
toom
uch
too
soon
good
brew
nice
and
smooth
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
there
isnt
much
bitterness
at
all
and
the
flavors
are
a
bit
dull
its
not
bad
at
all
but
its
not
outstanding
in
any
way
theres
some
very
light
roastiness
and
a
bit
iron
flavor
to
it
but
its
just
meh
to
me
d
nice
beer
to
try
but
wouldnt
recommend
more
than
a
couple
very
filling
compared
to
saranacs
caramel
porter
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
saranac
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
pleasant
beer
comparable
to
a
sam
adams
black
lager
d
delicious
beer
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
rich
but
not
so
heavy
that
i
cant
drink
a
few
d
goes
down
well
but
sits
a
little
heavy
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
1
maybe
2
in
a
sitting
drink
ability
is
if
youre
paying
ill
have
another
the
taste
isnt
there
at
all
if
its
free
like
this
one
was
i
guess
id
take
it
id
never
pay
for
it
though
pretty
drinkable
beer
sits
a
little
heavy
but
is
still
nice
d
highly
drinkable
i
have
to
agree
with
jason
alström
that
there
are
far
too
few
schwarzbiers
on
the
market
enjoy
this
one
as
well
as
sam
adams
black
lager
when
and
where
available
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
very
drinkable
im
impressed
with
the
balance
song
pairings
aliah
tell
me
your
that
somebody
a
tribe
called
quest
anita
applebaum
overall
what
was
best
about
this
brew
was
its
inclusive
flavor
profile
while
there
was
much
to
boast
about
in
the
flavor
no
ingredients
took
on
a
robust
role
had
there
been
an
amplification
of
the
nice
flavors
that
are
present
the
beer
would
have
packed
a
bigger
punch
and
been
ultimately
more
memorable
overall
nothing
surprising
from
matt
brewing
co
their
beers
are
kind
of
gateway
beers
into
serious
craft
beers
and
they
are
very
accessible
but
if
you
have
anything
approaching
a
sophisticated
palate
this
will
bore
you
good
to
give
to
beginners
or
people
used
to
bmc
i
wouldnt
bother
and
my
girlfriend
and
i
only
popped
these
because
we
needed
to
make
more
room
for
beer
in
her
fridge
got
that
lager
taste
and
the
malts
are
great
like
it
d
goes
down
easy
but
hindered
by
an
aroma
modestly
attractive
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
one
of
the
best
saranac
brews
ive
had
make
sure
you
drink
this
warmer
than
normal
drank
at
5055ºf
poured
gently
into
standard
nonic
glass
color
is
dark
dark
dark
brown
with
1finger
caramelbiegecolored
head
excellent
retention
and
gorgeous
lacing
aroma
consists
of
something
like
earthy
hay
or
dead
grass
not
a
negative
comment
toasted
malts
burnt
caramel
a
little
bit
of
mocha
and
cashews
tasting
this
is
just
splendid
lightly
toasted
malts
not
roasted
molasses
and
slight
bittering
hops
this
is
mediumbodied
and
only
stings
the
palate
a
little
bit
the
beer
is
gentle
in
complexity
this
beer
is
not
good
when
taken
right
out
of
the
fridge
im
not
sure
what
temperature
everyone
else
is
reviewing
at
but
make
sure
this
beer
is
served
on
the
warmer
side
even
at
5
5
otherwise
you
will
not
taste
any
of
the
aforementioned
flavors
i
recommended
drinking
this
beer
with
dessert
such
as
chocolate
cake
or
chocolate
mousse
d
big
malty
beer
may
be
fairly
filling
lingering
sweetness
drink
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
think
it
would
make
an
excellent
session
brew
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
saranac
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
pours
slightly
darker
than
cola
with
an
almost
opaque
clarity
head
was
1
5
inches
loose
and
khakicolored
and
eventually
settled
into
a
skim
with
a
tight
band
around
the
edges
and
a
few
dollops
of
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
nose
is
fairly
light
but
suggests
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
lactose
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
flavor
profile
comes
across
fairly
flat
a
generic
toasted
malt
character
suppresses
some
of
the
qualities
present
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
somewhat
average
for
the
style
but
goes
down
fairly
easy
i
think
it
would
be
good
with
steak
or
a
grilled
meat
drinkability
it
has
the
enhanced
attributes
on
would
expect
in
a
dark
lager
bold
and
consistent
very
pleasant
to
drink
slick
and
creamy
with
a
definite
fluffiness
for
lack
of
a
better
term
when
held
in
your
mouth
the
bubble
structure
makes
for
a
nice
lightness
on
the
palate
without
underplaying
the
roast
in
the
flavor
a
very
drinkable
flavorful
well
crafted
beer
typically
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
saranac
selections
d
an
ok
beer
for
a
session
meh
not
terribly
offensive
but
id
rather
not
drink
this
and
save
the
calories
and
money
for
something
better
very
appealing
deep
brown
color
with
a
creamcolored
smooth
head
the
smell
hints
caramel
and
banana
flavors
which
will
intensify
after
tasting
after
a
few
sconds
the
aroma
of
hops
adds
a
sweet
bitterness
to
the
beer
nice
balance
the
head
does
not
hold
to
long
i
like
the
beer
very
much
and
will
buy
it
again
great
job
saranac
this
one
is
definatly
an
easy
drinker
great
session
beer
exspecailly
for
the
low
price
all
around
a
pretty
decent
swarzbier
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
but
if
i
came
across
this
i
would
drink
it
again
pretty
good
for
the
price
it
cant
be
beat
now
on
to
the
others
in
the
sample
pack
not
bad
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
simple
easy
drinking
cheap
its
certainly
drinkable
but
there
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
here
im
looking
for
more
complexity
and
character
i
just
dont
get
that
here
d
i
cant
tell
after
the
first
one
but
i
cant
see
having
too
many
of
these
would
be
great
with
a
steak
though
d
not
an
exemplar
of
the
style
but
nothing
id
turn
away
from
this
beer
is
black
with
a
good
head
that
lasts
for
several
minutes
the
smell
is
weak
and
has
the
flavour
of
caramel
and
malt
the
main
flavour
of
this
beer
is
malt
but
the
hops
shine
through
at
moments
too
this
beer
seemed
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
for
a
dark
beer
not
bad
its
just
too
bad
that
it
didnt
have
a
nice
big
head
oh
well
still
good
final
thoughts
would
certainly
recommend
but
would
probably
not
buy
again
drinkability
i
finished
it
quickly
because
it
was
so
good
drinkability
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
never
turn
down
but
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
out
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
something
in
the
flavor
department
to
make
it
really
shine
still
an
easy
drinking
beer
d
well
done
excellent
swarzbier
black
forest
reveals
the
brewing
expertise
of
the
matt
brewing
company
a
very
fine
american
example
of
black
beer
should
be
compared
with
kostritzer
easy
to
drink
and
admire
one
of
the
better
offerings
made
in
the
united
states
flavor
complexity
is
enjoyably
relaxed
bottle
was
part
of
the
variety
twelve
pack
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlight
at
the
edges
thin
but
substantial
head
smell
was
like
wet
coffee
rinds
taste
was
very
good
lots
of
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
and
black
licorice
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
was
thick
enough
to
notice
but
smooth
enough
to
be
an
easy
drinking
beer
a
nice
combination
for
a
successful
schwartzbier
drinkability
was
on
the
high
side
as
it
had
a
great
flavor
was
very
light
but
had
presence
in
the
glass
one
of
the
better
saranac
beers
in
this
variety
pack
d
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
could
drink
one
after
another
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
working
well
with
the
flavor
profile
drinkable
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
i
would
recommend
it
drinkability
due
to
the
heavy
flavors
and
mouthfeel
its
hard
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
but
they
are
really
good
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
slight
amber
tint
nice
beige
one
finger
head
to
start
with
but
fell
quickly
to
a
slight
cloudy
ring
consistent
with
the
style
smells
pretty
sweet
like
caramel
raisins
and
fruitcake
sweet
and
sour
taste
like
prunes
dried
figs
and
black
licorice
light
carbonation
and
medium
body
quite
enjoyable
with
good
personality
i
love
schwarzbiers
and
this
brew
is
a
true
specimen
to
the
style
hands
down
the
best
of
the
saranac
trail
mix
sampler
d
it
is
a
wet
beer
suited
for
summer
it
is
also
warming
so
it
would
be
good
in
the
winter
m
very
dry
and
very
prickly
it
finishes
pretty
clean
very
dry
and
crisp
very
drinkable
id
prefer
this
in
the
fall
or
the
winter
like
i
would
a
stout
but
i
can
definitely
see
me
picking
this
up
when
it
gets
colder
surprisingly
good
for
saranac
i
wonder
how
it
compares
to
sam
adams
black
lager
drinkability
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
i
cant
drink
much
of
it
at
a
time
for
dinner
or
just
one
or
two
hanging
out
in
the
pub
fantastic
but
for
an
all
nighter
not
so
much
d
consuming
this
beer
is
a
breeze
i
could
easily
have
several
of
them
in
a
single
sitting
despite
the
dark
appearance
its
not
too
strong
or
heavy
so
it
has
year
round
drinkability
kind
of
disappointed
that
there
was
only
one
bottle
in
the
sixer
i
liked
this
one
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
tumbler
glass
big
brown
head
made
of
many
sizes
of
bubbles
the
liquid
is
a
dark
brown
and
has
lots
of
rising
and
clinging
carbonation
bubbles
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
say
this
looks
like
a
glass
of
coke
the
aroma
has
some
sweet
malts
and
piney
hops
the
combination
reminds
me
of
black
licorice
the
flavor
is
tasty
it
has
a
mild
sweetness
some
wheat
and
a
good
bitter
character
in
the
finish
i
dont
like
black
licorice
or
black
jelly
beans
but
this
beer
seems
to
have
the
good
aspects
of
those
candies
it
has
a
medium
body
but
little
coating
it
ends
up
feeling
a
bit
watery
the
carbonation
level
is
a
bit
above
average
there
arent
any
major
lingering
flavors
each
sip
goes
down
well
and
the
taste
is
very
good
but
theres
something
that
makes
me
think
i
wouldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
i
obtained
this
beer
through
a
saranac
mix
pack
i
wouldnt
skip
a
purchase
because
a
mix
contained
this
beer
but
i
also
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
just
the
black
forest
overall
impression
the
pape
the
addition
of
caramel
syrup
is
a
nono
if
you
believe
in
following
the
reinheitsgebot
sp
pours
very
dark
brown
with
small
off
white
foam
mostly
dissolves
but
leaves
some
volume
around
the
rim
light
roasted
malt
smell
slightly
sweet
creamy
caramel
taste
very
smooth
surprisingly
punching
carbonation
small
bubbles
good
drinkability
nice
beer
d
not
a
bad
lager
but
nothing
special
some
nice
caramel
and
roasted
malts
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
wouldnt
seek
out
but
would
have
again
notes
for
the
style
i
think
they
did
a
pretty
respectable
job
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
they
hit
what
they
were
going
for
still
a
solidoffering
aroma
is
the
strong
point
of
this
beer
its
really
let
down
in
other
areas
the
carbonation
problem
is
a
real
worry
overall
this
went
down
quick
and
easy
flavorful
not
heavy
nothing
off
and
enough
flavor
to
reach
for
another
surprise
from
matts
and
one
of
their
best
brews
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
redness
about
it
and
more
than
a
finger
of
tanned
head
decent
retension
and
sticky
lacing
around
the
glass
nose
is
a
bit
minerallike
with
some
notes
of
citrus
hops
taste
is
also
quite
mineral
filled
with
citrus
hops
present
both
upfront
and
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
crisp
finish
slight
grainy
malt
character
comes
through
as
it
warms
medium
body
with
a
flavor
profile
that
just
barely
suggests
dark
grain
but
doesnt
quite
get
there
with
the
flavors
regardless
it
is
a
pretty
decent
lager
that
is
easy
drinking
and
modestly
carbonated
d
well
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
begs
for
another
very
good
and
very
drinkable
beer
the
color
is
deceiving
as
this
looks
like
a
stout
or
porter
in
the
glass
but
goes
down
much
easier
d
2
of
3
excellent
drinking
beers
from
saranac
so
far
id
put
a
bit
of
these
in
my
fridge
if
i
had
a
good
price
and
availibility
id
buy
this
one
again
but
there
are
several
others
that
id
rather
pick
up
over
saranac
black
forest
d
a
bit
one
dimensional
for
me
the
roast
malt
character
is
appropriately
light
but
the
beer
lacks
the
body
and
depth
to
back
it
up
the
cola
flavor
is
not
entirely
pleasant
and
seems
to
be
one
of
the
dominant
features
of
the
beer
as
it
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
d
very
drinkable
a
very
schwarz
up
to
this
point
my
favorite
saranac
beer
got
this
in
an
adirondack
trail
mix
sixer
and
i
can
tell
you
this
is
the
jewel
of
the
trail
mix
poured
a
black
ruby
color
with
decent
head
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
is
chocolately
and
rich
like
your
usual
black
forest
cake
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
creamy
and
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
drinks
ok
goes
done
well
at
5
5
sessionable
ebony
with
rosewood
highlights
and
a
thin
cap
of
tan
colored
foam
that
leaves
behind
fine
lace
on
the
glass
lightly
toasted
malty
caramel
and
honey
with
a
faint
touch
of
nice
aroma
hops
in
the
nose
caramel
malty
sweetness
with
some
nice
noble
hop
bite
medium
light
bodied
with
bright
carbonation
a
decent
brew
for
sure
but
at
around
10
99
a
sixer
a
tad
over
priced
in
this
area
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
reddish
color
apparent
on
the
edge
a
thick
light
brown
head
which
dissipates
after
a
short
time
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
and
taste
both
have
a
caramel
malty
flavoring
with
a
slight
hop
profile
there
is
also
an
earthy
component
to
the
flavor
the
beer
seems
a
lightly
carbonated
and
does
not
feel
as
thick
as
one
might
expect
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
saranac
beer
would
buy
and
drink
again
though
sure
its
drinkable
but
mainly
because
there
isnt
enough
flavour
to
really
be
a
factor
drinkability
a
great
schwarzbier
this
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
certainly
one
of
saranacs
better
offerings
poured
into
a
wheat
style
glass
walnut
in
color
with
red
highlights
nice
tan
head
that
quickly
goes
to
a
thin
film
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
promises
a
good
malty
brew
and
that
is
what
you
have
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
can
be
found
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
had
heard
rumors
that
this
recipe
is
based
on
the
old
prior
double
dark
which
i
enjoyed
in
my
college
days
guess
it
has
been
too
long
for
me
to
say
they
taste
the
same
but
i
did
enjoy
drinking
both
this
beer
pours
a
nice
jet
cola
colour
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
two
finger
foamy
head
and
average
lacingthe
aromas
are
subtle
dark
roasty
maltsdark
fruits
and
some
berries
aswellit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
the
dark
roasty
malts
hitting
the
palette
first
followed
a
nice
array
of
tastes
of
dark
plumscherries
and
berries
followed
by
a
subtle
bitterness
but
not
overly
noticeable
at
alleven
though
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
i
just
feel
personally
i
have
had
tried
better
examples
of
this
style
has
that
saranac
not
bad
not
good
really
easy
to
pass
over
quality
about
it
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
saranac
sixpack
sampler
but
if
i
can
find
black
forest
in
a
sixpack
you
can
bet
ill
pick
some
up
nice
body
really
smooth
nice
sweetness
and
a
little
hint
of
roast
at
the
end
very
subtle
easy
drinking
beautiful
beer
i
was
not
sure
what
to
think
from
the
aroma
or
the
look
but
this
is
a
really
nice
tasting
beer
and
finishes
completely
wet
no
bitterness
really
or
hop
flavor
nice
connected
from
and
back
the
black
forest
conjures
up
images
of
a
deep
dark
rich
malty
german
doppelbock
or
even
a
schwarzbier
if
done
right
sorry
but
this
brew
doesnt
have
the
chops
to
match
the
awesomeness
of
its
name
drinkability
a
good
beer
but
drinks
a
bit
more
like
a
stout
than
a
schwarzbier
still
its
good
an
i
approve
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
1
inch
head
has
a
slightly
sweet
malt
aroma
taste
is
primarily
of
malts
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
fairly
smooth
overall
this
makes
for
a
quality
brew
d
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
that
being
said
i
probably
wont
go
for
this
one
again
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
dr
this
is
a
easy
light
bodied
dark
beer
with
full
flavor
drinkability
im
not
a
lager
fan
generally
but
this
rare
style
is
a
gem
its
clean
crisp
flavorful
and
light
reminds
me
much
of
a
sweeter
and
lighter
bock
its
a
great
reminder
that
dark
beers
dont
have
to
be
heavy
this
is
extremely
sessionable
and
refreshing
a
dark
lager
that
doesnt
have
the
alcoholic
harshness
that
dopplebocks
or
bocks
can
have
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
company
d
goes
down
easy
geat
price
i
honestly
cant
get
enough
of
this
stuff
saranac
black
forest
has
been
a
favorite
of
mine
for
a
long
time
and
i
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
highly
recomended
to
those
who
prefer
a
dark
but
not
heavy
or
strong
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
seems
like
a
light
version
of
the
style
the
beer
should
be
a
little
more
aggressive
than
this
i
dont
really
think
that
the
flute
helped
in
the
future
ill
probably
serve
my
schwarzbiers
in
a
regular
pint
glass
overall
i
hate
writing
reviews
like
this
but
i
thought
it
was
necessary
i
have
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
but
the
six
pack
i
bought
was
bad
i
will
try
it
again
and
hopefully
i
got
a
bad
batch
i
will
update
this
review
if
the
next
round
is
better
saranac
black
forest
is
a
dim
red
brown
lager
thats
nearly
black
the
head
is
light
brown
thick
and
foamy
and
shows
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
faint
tartness
in
the
aroma
which
includes
notes
of
metal
and
weeds
its
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
it
tastes
a
little
roasty
and
a
little
bitter
and
tastes
a
bit
like
coke
syrup
without
the
sugar
there
is
a
faint
hint
of
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
its
not
super
but
its
a
good
session
beer
d
overall
matt
brewing
has
made
a
good
textbook
brew
of
this
style
though
i
cant
say
i
enjoy
the
style
all
too
much
still
its
good
and
unique
to
try
at
least
once
pours
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
hint
of
red
a
one
finger
creamy
tan
head
dies
down
to
a
thick
blanket
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
and
random
spots
on
top
of
the
beer
lacing
is
light
and
almost
nonexistent
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
some
breadlike
smell
not
a
very
strong
smell
at
all
but
it
is
not
a
very
bad
smell
either
tastes
of
roasted
malts
a
decent
hop
presence
and
maybe
some
fruit
raisin
citrus
not
the
most
complex
taste
but
a
pretty
good
one
overall
i
like
the
dark
malts
balancing
with
the
good
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
definitely
light
as
called
for
by
the
style
carbonation
is
slightly
a
bit
overkill
stings
the
tongue
a
bit
and
the
beer
is
pretty
smooth
i
did
however
get
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
coming
through
towards
the
end
drinkability
is
good
the
taste
seems
like
it
would
be
fine
and
no
off
flavors
would
kill
the
beer
in
the
long
run
the
light
bottle
enables
me
to
drink
several
of
these
and
the
price
tag
is
worth
it
for
this
product
cool
drinkability
it
does
go
down
smooth
but
in
the
taste
department
not
very
drinkable
it
has
this
aftertaste
that
will
keep
me
away
and
probably
most
of
you
overall
this
is
quite
the
weak
beer
there
had
to
of
been
food
coloring
added
because
its
such
a
lightbodied
dismal
brew
saranac
can
put
out
a
better
brew
but
this
one
should
be
dropped
like
a
bad
habit
definitely
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
saranac
along
with
the
pumpkin
imperial
ipa
and
pale
ale
a
good
introduction
to
a
style
that
ill
admit
im
not
terribly
familiar
with
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
and
a
half
of
tan
head
i
is
dark
in
color
and
appears
garnet
when
held
to
the
light
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
smell
some
bread
and
some
roasted
malt
there
is
not
a
lot
of
taste
either
it
reminds
me
of
a
bock
i
get
some
roasted
malt
i
like
it
it
is
a
good
session
beer
it
is
not
over
the
top
in
any
way
i
could
drink
a
few
its
good
but
not
spectacular
in
any
way
pour
is
sort
of
notveryblack
quite
colalike
but
sits
in
th
glass
much
darker
and
produces
quite
a
foamy
head
aroma
is
subtle
but
all
black
malt
maybe
some
caramel
and
a
bit
of
pale
malt
as
well
but
by
no
means
apparent
very
subtle
flavor
is
a
dark
roasty
malt
presence
that
finshes
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
fairly
reserved
all
around
mouthfeel
is
also
fairly
colalike
a
lightmedium
with
strong
carbonation
drinkability
is
one
of
those
beers
where
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
but
there
isnt
too
much
that
grabs
me
otherwise
or
makes
me
want
to
have
more
d
a
very
good
brew
id
definitely
drink
another
d
i
really
like
this
beer
i
drink
it
quite
frequently
the
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
is
right
on
drinkability
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
nicer
saranac
brews
dark
brown
appearance
thought
the
aroma
was
weak
almost
nonexistent
right
on
par
with
most
satisfactory
bavarian
black
lagers
that
ive
tasted
caramel
notes
with
roasted
malts
nice
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
like
a
lager
but
with
the
extra
flavor
of
a
porter
or
extra
stout
d
not
the
kind
of
beer
you
would
have
a
lot
of
but
it
is
amazing
for
a
few
thin
lagerish
mouthfeel
somewhat
drinkable
my
first
schwarzbier
and
not
disappointed
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
color
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
not
what
you
would
expect
both
the
smell
and
taste
have
fruity
undertones
which
you
wouldnt
think
of
with
a
dark
beer
it
is
more
along
the
lines
of
an
ipa
than
a
stout
or
porter
very
dry
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
pretty
decent
example
of
the
style
and
a
refreshing
dark
beer
for
the
summer
with
lots
of
flavor
drinkability
good
for
swilling
average
at
best
hey
this
is
a
solid
brew
pours
fairly
dark
brown
and
has
a
solid
tan
head
with
thick
rings
of
lacing
smell
is
somewhat
light
but
still
nice
light
caramel
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
some
earthy
hops
as
well
taste
is
good
very
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
roast
with
moderate
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
and
very
very
smooth
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
with
ease
if
not
more
i
remember
drinking
this
stuff
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
my
saranac
mix
pack
and
being
fairly
impressed
with
schwarzbier
so
you
shouldnt
go
into
the
taste
test
expecting
too
too
much
and
black
forest
is
no
exception
where
i
find
this
excels
is
in
sweet
flavor
and
appearance
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
with
a
solid
deep
red
color
and
a
huge
rocky
head
taste
is
pretty
light
a
mix
of
malty
sweetness
and
roasty
bitterness
that
was
really
easy
to
quaff
not
a
special
beer
by
any
means
but
good
solid
stuff
final
thoughts
find
more
schwarzbiers
part
of
a
saranac
variety
pack
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appears
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
aromas
of
mostly
chocolate
and
caramel
a
good
roasty
taste
throughout
with
the
chocolate
and
caramel
creeping
in
nicely
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
very
easy
to
drink
pretty
good
beer
i
could
drink
a
hundred
of
these
which
may
or
not
be
good
right
now
it
feels
fantastic
a
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
black
lager
worth
a
try
its
ok
nothing
to
right
home
about
o
pretty
good
brew
it
kinda
stunk
to
drink
it
before
it
got
cold
enough
but
i
just
couldnt
wait
it
sounds
as
good
as
it
is
i
think
ive
just
become
a
schwarzbier
fan
its
really
that
good
if
you
ask
me
thinking
about
drinking
one
of
these
colder
or
even
from
a
tap
is
making
my
mouth
water
already
d
solid
brew
for
the
style
and
just
overall
really
enjoyable
easy
rinking
beer
its
light
on
the
palate
and
sits
light
in
the
stomach
sessionable
and
would
be
easy
to
kill
a
sixer
of
this
brew
i
will
have
to
keep
an
eye
out
of
sixers
of
this
to
keep
on
hand
for
a
thirst
quenching
brew
with
some
flavor
would
absolutely
visit
again
final
thoughts
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
liked
very
much
its
a
local
brew
so
i
have
to
give
kudos
i
really
love
the
color
of
this
beer
its
a
beautiful
deep
dark
reddish
brown
when
you
hold
it
up
to
light
and
it
almost
looks
black
just
normal
it
has
a
fairly
complex
smell
with
some
sweet
caramel
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
and
some
light
hints
of
citrus
the
caramel
and
coffee
really
come
through
in
tasting
it
and
there
is
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
its
got
an
appealing
medium
mouthfeel
and
for
a
darker
beer
i
think
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
tumbler
appears
a
clear
medium
brown
color
akin
to
root
beer
with
almost
an
inch
of
dense
light
ecru
foam
no
lacing
to
mention
here
but
still
a
nice
looking
pour
smells
and
tastes
of
toasty
bread
sweet
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
molasses
chocolate
and
bitter
hops
a
bit
more
than
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
one
of
my
favorites
from
saranac
but
i
only
ever
see
it
in
their
mixed
twelve
packs
id
like
to
see
this
one
in
sixers
around
here
taste
is
sweet
and
creamy
an
a
little
thick
on
the
tongue
has
some
bitterness
hops
in
the
dry
aftertaste
not
overly
outstanding
but
extremely
drinkable
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
sweet
porter
than
a
traditional
bavarian
beer
this
fortunately
is
a
style
that
can
be
paired
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
but
is
probably
best
paired
with
baked
potatoes
fries
or
pizza
overall
a
surprising
gem
from
my
saranac
variety
pack
big
on
dark
flavor
but
not
heavy
nor
highly
alcoholic
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
d
i
love
the
head
on
these
beers
and
their
maltiness
i
could
easily
drink
more
of
these
the
dark
ruby
color
mentioned
a
couple
reviews
below
is
a
perfect
description
of
the
color
the
main
taste
was
sweet
and
roasted
malt
this
beer
resembles
a
stout
somewhat
in
taste
and
smell
but
it
is
very
light
its
actually
refreshing
to
drink
i
was
expected
a
thick
mouthfeel
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
pleasant
taste
1
quart
growler
pours
a
dark
black
with
dark
reddish
brown
appearance
in
light
not
much
head
at
all
just
some
tan
bubbles
it
smells
of
malt
not
much
in
the
sense
of
smell
or
maybe
my
nose
is
off
today
the
taste
is
very
good
it
tastes
malty
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
you
can
also
taste
a
hoppy
bitterness
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
it
tastes
very
good
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
it
feels
very
light
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beer
it
was
only
3
for
a
quart
well
worth
it
very
drinkable
in
being
a
dark
but
not
thickish
brew
would
go
well
with
all
sorts
of
food
combinations
texmex
to
brick
oven
pizza
seems
versatile
and
would
please
a
broad
spectrum
of
folks
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
great
represenative
for
sure
this
beer
was
first
put
in
front
of
me
by
a
good
friend
of
minei
had
never
even
heard
of
it
but
then
as
of
now
i
have
beed
inroduced
to
some
very
good
beers
thank
you
susan
must
say
the
smell
did
not
impress
me
much
but
the
look
the
tastethe
drinkability
was
amazing
to
me
since
then
i
have
tried
many
a
good
great
and
not
so
great
beers
with
my
friend
and
niebor
she
trylu
saved
me
from
bad
beerthis
beer
as
well
as
other
from
saranac
should
be
tried
in
my
opipion
d
this
beer
has
some
smooth
easy
drinking
qualities
and
some
nice
malt
notes
but
it
is
very
onedimensional
and
i
got
a
bit
bored
with
it
after
one
glass
drinkability
this
is
my
first
taste
of
a
schwarzbier
and
this
was
graciously
provided
to
me
by
my
mother
this
style
to
me
is
really
nothing
more
than
a
lightly
roasted
black
lager
its
not
bad
but
the
lager
yeast
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
nice
to
try
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
on
my
own
as
always
though
i
definitely
need
to
explore
the
style
further
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
a
thin
white
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
chocolate
malt
the
flavor
is
sweet
creamy
and
smooth
the
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
easily
drinkable
a
good
offering
from
matt
brewing
dan
you
would
like
this
one
very
light
mouthfeel
on
this
one
crisp
with
a
short
bite
but
light
slight
tingle
on
the
tongue
when
sipped
tastes
of
fresh
bread
and
molasses
kind
of
a
syrupy
aftertaste
in
there
as
well
not
bad
this
is
my
first
adventure
into
the
schwarzbier
category
and
im
not
disappointed
ill
venture
here
again
recommend
12
oz
poured
blackbrown
with
a
good
sized
cream
head
light
roast
malt
aroma
smooth
mouthfeel
roasted
malt
and
coffee
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
that
finishes
pretty
clean
has
more
body
than
some
of
matts
other
brews
pretty
good
example
of
a
schwarzbier
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
matts
brewings
more
respectable
beers
a
drinkable
brew
very
enjoyable
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
no

sampled
on
feb

2009
the
pour
is
a
very
dark
ruby
red
and
brown
with
a
little
beige
head
that
does
not
last
terribly
long
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
sweet
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
bitter
hops
are
the
first
sensation
i
get
in
the
flavor
followed
quickly
by
sweet
sugary
malts
overall
a
sweeter
brew
its
a
shame
too
because
the
makings
are
there
for
a
quality
brew
but
the
execution
just
fell
fall
short
disappointing
schwarzbiers
excite
me
this
one
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
big
tan
head
that
smells
of
coffee
grounds
and
dark
chocolate
taste
is
very
mellow
and
approachable
this
is
the
sort
of
black
beer
and
that
even
my
unadventurous
girlfriend
could
handle
it
doesnt
have
any
sharp
corners
that
could
challenge
the
palate
its
flavors
are
roasty
but
not
charred
tending
toward
the
sweeter
side
of
the
dark
spectrum
rather
than
the
bitter
burned
end
very
drinkable
pretty
good
beer
i
would
like
more
bold
flavors
but
it
fits
the
style
a
dark
beer
with
light
flavors
almost
black
as
night
with
some
ruby
tones
good
carbonation
with
lasting
thin
head
hints
of
caramel
and
even
some
coffee
in
the
nose
with
all
that
roasted
caramel
malt
impressive
in
its
balance
of
malt
and
aromatic
hops
creamy
mouthfeel
and
it
goes
down
easy
delicious
beer
from
saranac
at
an
economical
price
id
say
pass
on
this
beer
nothing
that
special
about
it
i
am
a
fan
of
saranac
beers
this
is
the
first
one
that
i
have
not
been
all
that
fond
of
i
will
chalk
it
up
to
the
style
just
not
one
to
my
liking
notes
buy
the
trail
mix
if
you
can
you
def
wont
be
disappointed
an
allaround
good
delicious

with

for

brew
the
mellow
flavors
merry
well
making
this
go
down
easy
overall
one
of
my
more
preferred
offerings
from
saranac
a
style
that
is
not
that
easily
found
on
shelves
of
american
craft
brew
but
one
that
is
done
very
well
pours
a
dark
ruby
almost
purple
with
a
strong
light
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
some
grassy
notes
flavor
is
too
sweet
for
me
but
seems
to
hold
to
hold
true
to
the
germaneuropean
style
of
this
beer
best
description
for
me
of
this
style
would
be
a
hard
roasted
marzenoctoberfest
i
need
to
explore
this
style
a
little
more
before
im
too
critical
of
the
beer
d
very
drinkable
for
a
dark
beer
you
know
youre
drinking
a
beer
but
it
wont
fill
you
up
too
quickly
also
as
the
alcohol
content
is
rather
normal
no
need
to
worry
about
falling
over
after
one
likewise
w
the
hops
very
subtle
good
session
beer
overall
drinkability
is
excellent
draft
the
distillery
rochester
ny
pours
a
lovely
deep
and
rich
redbrown
color
with
a
pale
brown
yet
thin
head
very
dark
color
a
slight
odor
of
coffee
and
chocolate
mixed
together
but
not
too
overpowering
initial
slightly
bitter
coffee
taste
similar
to
guinness
but
less
dry
which
leads
to
a
very
smooth
aftertaste
the
only
problem
with
this
one
is
that
its
a
little
thin
and
not
as
rich
and
creamy
as
it
looks
this
bavarian
style
beer
was
a
deep
woodstain
brown
approaching
black
out
of
the
bottle
the
tan
head
was
small
only
as
thick
as
a
pencil
and
the
retention
no
so
great
either
the
aromas
were
very
soft
hints
of
chocolate
and
barley
the
flavors
however
were
good
some
hoppy
notes
first
soon
followed
by
a
rich
maltiness
hints
of
nuts
fruit
and
some
chocolate
the
body
was
mediumfull
and
the
mouthfeel
creamy
i
was
not
blown
away
by
this
and
it
sounded
darker
than
it
was
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
overall
a
good
drinkable
beer
that
is
just
missing
a
bit
in
the
flavor
department
would
like
to
try
it
at
least
once
again
d
definitely
a
dessert
beer
i
have
to
say
this
its
one
of
the
better
saranac
styles
nice
artwork
on
the
lable
another
fine
addition
to
my
collection
1060
labels
so
far
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
the
only
place
it
sort
of
misses
the
mark
a
touch
is
the
mouthfeel
and
the
thinness
is
certainly
tolerable
and
far
from
offensive
and
likely
a
victim
of
personal
preference
more
than
anything
else
would
like
to
see
it
more
often
on
its
own
in
six
packs
but
the
saranac
regular
and
seasonal
mixed
sixes
and
twelves
seem
to
be
the
norm
more
often
than
not
around
here
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
d
an
easy
drinker
with
lots
of
flavor
a
well
balanced
beer
that
goes
down
easy
this
is
my
first
schwarzbier
if
theyre
all
this
good
then
im
a
fan
for
life
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
approaches
opaque
tannish
head
nose
is
kind
of
mapleish
overall
seems
a
bit
onedimensional
interesting
flavor
brings
an
interesting
sweet
tone
it
borders
on
being
too
much
but
by
just
a
hair
it
keeps
it
tolerable
an
earthy
tone
gets
in
on
the
mix
as
well
but
the
sweet
vaguely
honey
edge
keeps
control
over
things
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
carbonation
with
the
liquid
being
a
bit
sticky
overall
a
nice
drinker
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
style
yes
but
this
is
still
a
solid
enough
offering
overall
a
solid
beer
there
are
just
not
enough
of
this
great
style
produced
in
the
us
my
favorite
is
sprechers
black
bavarian
but
i
cant
get
that
here
in
maine
saranac
black
forest
is
an
acceptable
substitute
my
first
stab
at
a
schwarzbier
here
pours
an
extremely
dark
but
free
flowing
oil
black
not
like
a
a
highly
viscous
ris
smells
of
caramel
and
many
other
things
i
could
not
believe
something
that
pours
this
dark
and
was
so
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
unique
style
that
i
was
impressed
with
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
sit
around
and
enjoy
drinkability
this
was
from
a
6
pack
variety
pack
with
6
different
beers
props
to
saranac
for
that
i
would
search
this
one
out
as
something
to
bring
to
a
novice
as
an
excellent
intro
to
dark
beers
drinkability
i
would
say
that
drinkability
is
low
as
the
sweetness
becomes
somewhat
cloying
as
it
warms
up
after
reading
the
reviews
in
here
on
this
beer
i
thought
i
would
really
like
it
i
was
a
little
disappointed
this
is
a
very
dark
looking
beer
dark
brown
with
hints
of
red
in
it
the
advertise
a
thick
creamy
head
but
i
just
didnt
see
it
the
flavor
is
caramel
and
malty
but
it
smelled
and
tasted
almost
a
little
skunky
definitely
tastes
lighter
than
it
looks
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
tart
it
wasnt
a
terrible
beer
but
it
wasnt
good
either
and
i
was
expecting
more
md
rather
thin
on
the
feel
very
well
carbonated
a
good
beer
that
would
be
great
to
have
around
if
you
love
malty
beers
drinakability
its
okay
dthis
is
a
decent
but
not
great
schwartzbier
it
is
pretty
refreshing
but
could
use
a
bit
more
of
that
roasted
quality
i
would
have
it
again
it
offered
but
probably
would
no
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
mediocore
stuff
pours
a
nice
black
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
good
looking
light
tan
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
nose
is
kind
of
fruity
with
slight
roast
and
a
bit
of
grain
taste
follows
with
a
lot
of
graininess
and
next
to
no
roast
factor
some
fruitish
flavor
in
here
and
lagery
smoothness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
drinkability
is
good
overall
an
ok
beer
but
certainly
doesnt
compare
to
a
top
notch
shwarzbier
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
conversion
beer
to
get
bud
drinkers
to
like
dark
beer
a
good
conversion
beer
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
thanks
again
to
orcasteve
love
it
buy
it
if
you
can
by
far
my
favorite
saranac
brew
d
i
liked
it
not
sure
how
easy
it
will
be
for
me
to
get
locally
it
is
something
i
would
keep
my
eye
out
for
to
share
with
my
drinking
buddies
12oz
bottle
poured
into

saranac

is
a
pretty
decent
schwarzbier
that
is
worth
a
shot
pours
a
dark
brown
blackish
color
and
has
a
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
roast
anc
chocolate
malts
tastes
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
acidic
as
well
mouthfeel
is
average
and
it
leave
a
little
behind
in
the
aftertaste
so
it
isnt
totally
dry
easy
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
quite
impressive
for
an
american
made
schwartzbier
i
would
seek
this
out
as
a
decent
example
for
the
style
especially
since
it
will
be
fresh
in
the
us
and
fairly
cheap

thanks
to

bringing

me
to

character
a
nice
flavor
feel
is
appropriate
for
the
style
with
good
carbonation
another
solid
brew
from
saranac
i
havent
been
disappointed
yet
d
easily
drinkable
i
could
session
this
one
drinkability
is
good
saranacucfx
is
right
down
the
road
from
me
so
i
consider
this
commercially
available
as
i
dont
have
to
go
to
a
specialty
shop
to
get
it
and
for
a
commercially
available
version
of
my
favorite
style
its
pretty
decent
lightmedium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
slight
astringency
cut
with
a
nice
juicy
finish
very
light
and
refreshing
with
excellent
drinkability
this
is
the
best
schwarzbier
ive
ever
had
but
that
isnt
saying
much
as
ive
only
enjoyed
a
few
of
them
d
notes
good
drinkability
this
is
a
solid
well
balanced
beer
roasty
but
not
overpowering
this
beer
had
a
good
head
it
was
creamy
offwhite
head
the
beer
was
thin
and
dark
a
reddishblack
it
reminded
me
of
a
cola
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
dry
and
smooth
it
was
not
bitter
this
beer
was
highly
carbonated
id
have
another
one
of
these
beers
d
the
intensity
of
the
phenolic
and
hoppy
taste
midpalate
combined
with
the
increasing
bitterness
makes
this
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
drink
the
taste
itself
is
so
heavy
and
obvious
that
having
more
than
one
or
two
would
be
a
chore
not
bad
at
all
though
pours
a
very
nice
dark
color
nearly
black
with
some
nice
head
and
great
lacing
it
has
a
very
nice
scent
nicely
balance
between
hops
and
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
aroma
although
it
is
a
very
slight
scent
not
very
strong
great
taste
a
nice
light
beer
with
slight
burnt
grain
flavors
and
a
small
bitter
aftertaste
a
nice
balance
it
goes
down
fine
a
nice
beer
to
try
one
of
my
favorite
saranacs
drinkability
this
is
really
good
i
dont
want
to
put
down
the
glass
by
the
time
i
put
the
glass
down
im
already
reaching
for
it
again
so
i
can
get
another
smell
or
sip
this
is
a
really
nice
experience
it
seems
to
have
a
lot
more
character
than
some
of
the
other
schwarzbiers
ive
had
it
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
big
creamy
tan
head
the
head
makes
nice
lace
that
slowly
slides
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
its
aroma
is
sweet
with
roasted
malts
and
caramel
the
flavors
of
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
caramel
dance
on
the
tongue
as
nice
bitter
notes
slide
in
from
the
sides
to
finish
slowly
with
a
light
bitterness
it
has
a
smooth
and
creamy
palate
with
soft
carbonation
that
sets
you
up
for
anther
sip
d
easy
drinking
for
such
a
dark
beer
i
miss
the
esters
i
would
get
were
this
an
ale
feels
really
smooth
in
your
mouth
goes
down
surprisingly
fast
saranac
brews
are
generally
disappointing
given
the
fact
they
all
taste
almost
identical
save
a
few
minor
details
however
the
black
forest
with
its
menacing
black
bear
on
the
label
is
a
keeper
lots
of
flavours
but
still
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
nice
done
the
heavy
thick
mouthfeel
decreases
the
drinkability
somewhat
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
a
second
or
maybe
a
third
bottle
so
once
again
another
why
thank
you
yes
i
just
think
i
might
so
he
did
and
thus
lived
moderately
happy
ever
after
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
at
first
glance
it
just
looks
dark
brown
but
hold
it
up
to
the
light
and
dark
ruby
highlights
come
out
a
light
beige
brown
head
disappeared
pretty
quickly
leaving
no
detectable
lacing
aroma
is
caramel
and
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
taste
is
really
the
same
there
is
a
hint
of
astringency
like
strong
coffee
but
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
creamy
up
front
but
it
finishes
pretty
thin
its
another
solid
beer
from
the
matt
brewing
co
i
think
it
must
be
one
of
their
best
beers
this
beer
is
not
complex
and
it
does
not
need
to
beit
is
just
fine
the
way
it
is
d
a
very
enjoyable
bavarian
brew
a
highly
enjoyable
session
beer
this
is
a
very
good
dark
lager
from
matt
brewing
it
poured
with
a
black
body
and
and
a
small
light
brown
head
it
had
a
rich
taste
featuring
delicious
dark
malt
with
hints
of
rich
fruit
with
a
smooth
lager
finish
well
done
one
of
their
best
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
schwarzbier
a
nice
solid
schwarzbier
love
the
bottlegrowler
a
gem
from
saranac
well
worth
grabbing
and
enjoying
and
one
of
my
favorite
schwarzbiers
verdict
a
decent
schwarzbier
drinkable
and
comes
in
a
neat
little
mini
growler
one
of
the
better
beers
from
saranac
appearance
black
almost
no
light
came
through
smell
was
malty
and
a
bit
fruity
taste
was
malty
fruity
with
a
hint
of
licorice
bitterness
was
just
enough
to
keep
the
sweetness
balanced
mouthfeel
was
mediem
body
and
the
drinkibility
was
not
bad
i
like
this
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
versions
out
their
the
appearance
of
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
nameit
pours
black
with
a
slight
slight
redpurple
hue
to
it
containing
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
only
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
you
finish
it
off
the
smell
is
really
greata
nice
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
malt
alcohol
and
even
licorice
the
taste
is
strong
bitter
slightly
fruity
sweet
with
a
very
nice
afterkick
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
however
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
really
impressed
with
this
brew
drinkability
enoyed
the
beer
not
a
roasty
beer
but
a
very
good
dark
beer
d
overall
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
clean
finish
not
one
i
will
focus
on
but
good
enough
to
recommend
trying
overall
one
of
saranacs
best
had
to
ding
it
a
little
because
its
to
high
in
alcohol
for
the
style
but
a
nice
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
light
and
roasty
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
again
d
extremely
enjoyable
and
a
nice
lighter
change
from
the
usual
winter
warmer
d
very
easy
to
drink
its
for
any
season
this
beer
has
a
little
sentimentality
as
well
so
ill
never
turn
it
down
overall
im
not
a
big
saranac
fan
so
this
was
a
nice
surprise
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
a
very
nice
malty
lager
flavorful
yet
balanced
it
is
a
beer
that
would
be
easy
to
down
in
good
numbers
too
bad
i
only
get
it
in
variety
packs
with
two
black
forests
this
beer
poured
a
beautiful
dark
black
with
reddish
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
and
a
frothy
threefinger
head
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
with
some
coffee
hints
the
taste
is
like
a
muted
porter
there
are
some
smoky
elements
with
some
hints
of
caramel
that
give
way
to
hints
coffee
and
maybe
even
some
nuttiness
with
very
little
if
any
hop
bite
this
is
a
nice
beer
thats
got
a
good
mouthfeel
and
i
could
imagine
having
a
couple
in
one
sitting
pretty
enjoyable
and
pretty
simple
nice
flavor
with
more
heft
needed
in
the
feel
very
clear
and
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
it
had
a
tan
head
that
showed
decent
retention
and
a
bit
of
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
was
mostly
malt
with
brown
sugar
grain
and
caramel
dominant
low
bitterness
with
very
mild
chocolate
its
sweet
but
the
malt
still
seems
a
little
thin
hop
flavour
kicks
in
towards
the
middle
mostly
citrus
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
and
theres
some
obvious
residual
sugar
in
the
texture
carbonation
was
decent
fairly
drinkable
but
pretty
average
and
inoffensive
black
brown
brew
with
a
fizzy
limp
head
and
minor
lacing
evident
smells
like
coffeenut
with
a
touch
of
molasses
the
taste
brings
on
lots
of
charcoal
and
a
grassy
bitterness
with
a
peppery
fizz
definitely
leaves
some
bite
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
somewhat
aqueous
but
very
sprite
more
like
a
refreshing
summer
beer
there
is
a
subtle
nut
background
i
think
pretty
simple
stuff
and
nothing
special
at
all
its
pretty
drinkable
other
than
i
just
wouldt
be
interested
in
having
more
than
one
if
there
were
any
kind
of
choices
available
it
didnt
go
well
with
my
meal
that
night
which
included
baked
potatoe
and
cole
slaw
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
either
it
has
a
decent
charcoal
flavor
that
is
pleasant
at
moments
a
sample
from
the
sample
pack
the
appearance
is
deliciouslooking
a
really
dark
color
with
a
quickly
thinnedout
head
the
smell
was
not
too
great
or
special
definitely
had
a
good
roasting
flavor
but
it
lacked
specific
ingredients
essences
i
wanted
to
smell
more
of
that
malt
and
nutwoody
flavor
but
it
seemed
overpowered
within
the
roast
aroma
the
taste
also
lacked
some
punches
but
it
had
a
good
bitter
taste
one
thing
this
drink
does
have
going
for
it
is
its
above
average
carbonation
which
makes
it
really
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
not
too
strong
on
flavor
but
a
decent
drink
in
the
end
drinkability
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
than
1
in
a
night
d
fairly
high
id
say
i
could
make
this
my
beer
for
the
evening
if
i
only
had
a
few
more
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
and
one
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
to
try
new
things
enjoy
drinkability
fantastic
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
a
wonderful
session
beer
easily
one
of
saranacs
best
beers
a
good
call
anytime
for
a
nice
bavarianstyle
schwarzbier

ive
had
this
before
and
never
quite
appreciated
this
untl
now
this
is
a
great
beer
from
saranac
and
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
them
i
had
two
of
these
on
tap
at
the
brewery
tour
now
i
remember
why
i
finished
them
so
fast

is
my
favorite
saranac
brew

little
more

my
usual
ontap
version
good
med
body
though
once
again
being
alittle
thinner
than
the
tap
version
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
very
good
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
really
good
attempt
at
a
schwarzbier
but
when
it
comes
to
schwarzbiers
köstritzer
is
easier
to
get
and
its
better
dark
chocolate
colored
beer
the
taste
was
like
a
chocolatecaramel
bread
that
was
cooked
in
an
open
fire
pit
i
do
mean
this
is
a
good
way
though
great
taste
from
top
to
bottom
of
bottle
smooth
with
pleasant
aftertaste
i
will
recommend
to
anybody
very
nice
lager
i
really
enjoyed
it
light
bodied
and
definitely
drinkable
not
sure
how
it
lives
up
to
the
style
but
i
will
drink
it
again
for
sure
saranac
brews
this
product
using
caramel
and
two
row
barley
malts
hallertauer
and
mt
hood
hops
and
lager
yeast
to
produce
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
dark
beer
the
alcohol
level
is
5
5
percent
by
volume
and
there
are
173
calories
in
a
12
oz
serving
mouthfeel
light
bodied
though
could
have
been
slightly
lighter
well
carbonated
this
beer
was
bubbling
til
the
dire
end
d
pretty
high
a
nice
alternative
to
a
heavv
wintery
beer
when
youre
looking
to
have
a
few
ive
bought
it
by
the
sixpack
frequently
and
always
call
dibs
on
it
when
i
split
a
variety
pack
with
a
friend
easy
drinking
very
sessionable
and
nice
flavors
d
curiously
interesting
beer
but
drab
and
boring
at
the
same
time
after
sampling
the
traditional
lager
thought
id
try
the
dark
side
of
saranac
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
look
of
dark
cedar
almost
mocha
body
with
shortlived
head
malt
is
heavy
creamy
with
a
hint
of
metal
in
the
scent
a
thin
fleeting
mouthfeel
with
soda
pop
bubbles
when
chewed
odd
tasteim
about
to
take
a
dorito
to
chase
it
overall
better
straight
than
chewed
only
a
few
schwarzbiers
sampled
mostly
japanese
and
of
course
xingu
not
in
that
class
but
a
nice
find
in
the
winter
sampler
not
a
bad
beer
it
pours
a
pretty
dark
rubyish
color
with
a
little
head
that
dissipates
quicly
decent
to
average
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
molasses
metalic
sweet
fruits
the
taste
is
caramel
malt
some
molasses
maybe
a
little
coffeeish
maybe
some
raisin
flavors
maybe
a
slightly
burnt
quality
to
the
barley
this
is
medium
bodied
slightly
carbonated
but
not
overly
so
it
leans
towards
the
sweet
malts
rather
than
the
dryish
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
slight
maybe
a
little
on
the
refreshing
watery
side
the
aftertaste
is
slight
just
a
tinge
of
hoppiness
on
the
back
end
but
you
have
to
look
for
it
not
a
bad
beer
not
exceptional
by
any
means
schwarzbier
if
im
spelling
it
correctly
is
a
better
bavarian
dark
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
i
think
its
easily
a
session
beer
this
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
on
saranacs
long
list
and
i
look
out
for
it
i
was
happy
to
find
this
mini
grower
from
them
since
i
cant
ever
seem
to
find
it
in
a
pack
that
isnt
a
mixed
pack
d
i
enjoyed
the
smoky
and
dark
flavors
of
this
beer
certainly
a
sessionable
dark
beer
d
great
dark
lager
good
session
lager
d
a
good
beer
that
follows
the
style
very
closely
i
was
suprised
and
would
enjoy
another
one
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brownblack
with
ruby
undertones
and
a
nice
tan
head
nose
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
taste
is
of
those
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
light
hop
finish
to
balance
things
out
nicely
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
d

highly
drinkable
a
good
dark
session
beer
akin
to
a
dunkel
weizen
bottle
pour
cellar
temperature
into
a
pint
glass
creamy
mouthfeel
pleasant
taste
mainly
malt
finishes
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
but
restrained
hops
provide
a
solid
backbone
the
mouthfeel
and
slightly
sweet
finish
makes
this
beer
feel
like
it
has
a
lot
of
body
and
substance
the
sweetness
reduces
its
drinkability
for
me
tasty
but
not
too
exciting
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
thanks
to
my
friend
for
sharing
this
with
me
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
sampler
but
still
not
great
i
enjoyed
it
but
dont
think
i
would
go
in
search
of
more
from
the
bottle
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
adirondacks
there
is
a
place
where
even
light
is
scared
to
enter
the
black
forest
it
inspired
us
to
brew
this
delicious
bavarian
style
black
beer
with
caramel
sweetness
medium
body
and
our
trademark
rich
creamy
head
look
for
the
delicate
brownishred
color
dont
be
afraid
of
the
dark
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
minimal
head
soft
malt
slightly
dark
aromas
smells
like
a
nice
version
of
this
classic
brew
the
tastes
are
there
the
cooling
roasted
flavor
of
the
semisweet
malts
slight
hop
bitterness
and
some
complexity
but
this
lasts
only
for
a
second
then
all
is
replaced
with
a
dull
watery
seltzer
what
a
shame
good
flavor
out
of
the
gate
with
none
at
the
finish
but
still
one
of
saranacs
better
beers
i
drank
my
2
and
wish
i
had
2
more
a
nice
blackish
color
with
a
solid
tan
headskie
gives
good
brewhope
taste
not
quite
where
id
like
balance
is
ok
but
something
lacking
in
malt
profile
smooth
enough
to
make
for
easy
drinking
but
do
i
really
want
another
perhaps
but
i
think
i
can
do
better
i
remember
this
beer
being
much
better
in
the
past
perhaps
this
was
an
old
bottle
no
freshness
date
is
present
on
th
bottle
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
near
future
without
looking
at
my
other
scores
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
this
is
tasty
on
target
for
style
and
easy
drinking
i
really
like
how
the
hop
flavors
lay
out
on
my
tongue
and
blend
so
nicely
with
the
roast
and
sweetness
of
the
malts
pours
a
burnt
rasberry
chocolate
color
okay
dark
brown
with
lots
of
ruby
tint
the
head
exceeds
2
fingers
and
is
the
color
of
hazelnut
creamer
it
slowly
dissipates
to
a
solid
surface
layer
this
looks
appealing
on
my
nose
i
can
get
the
hint
of
some
dry
and
dark
roasted
malt
along
with
some
chocolate
and
sweet
toffee
fairly
sweet
smelling
with
some
floral
hops
aroma
also
balancing
it
out
a
bit
sipping
reveals
a
strong
brown
malt
flavor
which
lacks
the
chocolate
i
sensed
when
smelling
which
is
a
little
disappointing
but
the
hops
quickly
swoop
into
balance
out
the
toffee
sweetness
and
instead
leaves
a
drying
floral
hops
flavor
in
my
mouth
by
the
swallow
a
bitter
flavor
remains
in
my
mouth
between
sips
interesting
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
i
expected
maybe
just
a
bit
more
roast
but
this
suits
the
style
i
guess
carbonation
hits
the
sides
of
my
tongue
right
away
as
i
sip
it
the
body
is
relatively
light
and
the
finish
is
rather
dry
for
such
a
low
alcohol
brew
i
have
a
quart
and
i
plan
on
drinking
it
a
nice
little
winter
brew
that
isnt
too
warming
but
actually
is
better
for
drinking
than
being
a
winter
sipper
cheers
poured
a
bottle
of
this
after
another
frigid
day
in
syracuse
this
beer
doesnt
taste
quite
like
a
schwarzbier
but
its
still
pretty
good
aroma
of
dry
cocoa
and
barley
with
a
semibitter
chocolate
flavor
and
smooth
finish
not
an
amazing
beer
but
wellbalanced
tasty
and
very
drinkable
d
again
not
bad
but
not
great
kinda
boring
but
inoffensive

caramel

dominates
the
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
though
the
smell
is
a
bit
weaker
than
expected
roasty
malt
sweetness
characterizes
the
flavor
but
does
not

with

definitely
quite

due

both
the
pleasing
flavor
and

only
the
second
schwarzbier
ive
had
and
i
really
like
it
ive
been
lukewarm
on
saranacs
offerings
in
the
past
but
this
is
probably
their
best
one
ill
probably
get
this
one
again
worth
trying
in
their
mix
pack
at
least
once
its
okay
another
decent
but
underwhelming
saranac
offering
their
caramel
porter
is
still
my
favorite
drinkabilitygoes
down

but
i
wouldnt
go
out

my

to
seek
this
one
out

but
is
clean
and
doesnt

aftertaste
as
far
as
stouts
go
this
one
is
delicious
and
very
drinkable
feels
like
it
has
a
kick
but
is
quite
the
enjoyable
stout
poured

by

aftertaste
moderate
mouthfeel
crisp
decent
carbonation
goes
down

some
bitterness
that
lingers
a
decent
lager
overall
i
can
drink
a
few
a
very
nice
offering
a
great
combination
of
aroma
and
taste
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
with
sauerbraten
pick
this
one
up
as
a
great
beer
for
a
chill
winter
evening
yet
another
winter
pack
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
reddish
tint
and
little
head
retention
or
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
fruity
smell
to
it
with
a
hint
of
caramel
tastes
fairly
fruity
too
has
a
good
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
not
overly
bitter
tastes
suprisingly
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
worth
a
try
the
taste
echoes
the
smell
for
the
most
part
although
there
is
a
slight
metallic
taste
for
some
reason
the
roasted
nuts
is
the
lasting
flavor
on
the
pallette
although
the
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
are
the
upfront
flavors
body
is
thin
and
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
quite
drinkable
ive
always
liked
schwarzbiers
for
being
dark
and
complex
yet
not
overly
heavy
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
nice
dark
body
but
almost
no
head
at
all
and
no
retention
smelled
kind
of
like
a
light
beer
with
not
much
of
a
taste
to
it
either
mouthfeel
was
a
little
more
than
thin
about
what
i
expected
for
this
beer
not
too
drinkable
of
a
beer
in
my
point
of
view
but
everyone
else
seems
to
rate
it
fairly
highly
maybe
i
got
a
bad
sample
in
my
bottle
but
overall
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
brew
it
did
not
meet
what
i
had
expected
one
of
the
better
beers
from
saranac
in
the
mixed
twelve
not
a
fantastic
schwarzbier
but
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
in
general
pours
very
dark
brown
with
hint
of
red
head
about
one
finger
tan
color
fades
too
soon
with
some
lacing
smell
is
bready
with
coffee
in
there
also
taste
slightly
sweet
burnt
coffee
caramel
and
malt
with
some
hop
at
the
end
a
very
good
mix
mouthfeel
medium
and
smooth
very
enjoyable
beer
very
drinkable
beer
wow
pours
deep
deep
brown
id
dare
to
call
it
black
smells
of
sweet
caramel
definitly
sweet
smelling
the
taste
is
really
well
rounded
with
caramel
notes
hints
of
coffee
slight
fruitlike
flavor
goes
down
real
smooth
actually
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
i
would
have
thought
from
the
pour
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
love
the
mini
growler
definitly
makes
it
stand
out
on
the
shelf
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
i
poured
from
a
12
ounze
bottle
into
a
glass
it
was
very
thick
producing
not
much
head
and
even
less
lace
the
smell
was
very
bland
the
taste
was
pretty
solid
very
well
mixed
out
of
the
5
or
so
sanarancs
i
have
tried
i
probably
like
this
one
the
best
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
dont
drink
and
review
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
for
mostly
sentimental
reasons
this
gets
a
high
drinkability
from
me
easy
to
drink
widely
available
in
my
area
a
rare
style
and
cheap
black
forest
wont
dissappoint
overall
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
decent
dark
beer
stouts
are
my
favorite
i
would
definatly
buy
again
this
time
in
a
six
pack
di
like
this
beeri
could
drink
a
fewi
think
the
darker
the
beer
from
saranac
the
better
it
is
i
would
reccomend
this
beer
to
beer
drinkers
i
wouldnt
buy
the
mixed
case
againi
would
just
stick
to
seperate
6
packs
of
the
beers
i
found
appealing
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
smooth
opinion
i
thought
it
was
a
excellent
beer
for
smoothness
and
session
recurrence
d
yup
saranac
does
have
some
pretty
boring
brews
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
i
love
the
minigrowler
it
ran
me
2
99
and
yielded
two
pints
its
not
hugely
roasty
but
its
not
supposed
to
be
really
its
wellbalanced
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
very
nice
flavor
drinkability
easy
drinking
sessionable
i
have
only
had
it
in
the
mix
pack
and
this
and
the
black
and
tan
are
typically
the
first
to
be
grabbed
by
everyone
saranacs
black
forest
is
a
pretty
solid
representation
of
the
schwarzbier
style
it
looks
very
much
like
a
good
stout
its
nearly
black
with
a
touch
of
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
and
has
a
great
big
light
brown
head
on
it
when
poured
into
a
stein
the
nose
is
nice
a
good
mix
of
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
fruit
somewhat
sweet
with
a
little
bite
to
it
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
arent
what
youd
expect
given
the
apperance
and
aroma
of
the
brew
but
is
consistent
with
the
schwarzbier
style
its
got
the
roasted
malt
and
caramel
and
coffee
youd
expect
but
not
as
intensely
flavorful
as
most
stouts
and
certainly
no
where
near
as
thick
as
one
think
of
it
as
an
easy
drinking
stout
where
a
good
stout
leaves
you
filled
after
a
couple
you
could
easily
drink
this
like
a
lager
and
have
several
its
well
balanced
and
goes
down
very
easily
d
one
is
enough
very
bold
heavy
flavor
nice
changeup
from
a
light
beer
for
a
night
disclaimer
schwarzbiers
are
a
favorite
and
this
one
is
easily
the
best
of
the
us
craftbrewed
varieties
deep
black
with
redbrown
highlights
moderate
head
retention
though
it
laces
the
glass
nicely
a
bit
of
malty
lager
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
crisp
lager
and
dark
coffeecarmel
malts
that
is
at
both
incredibly
complex
and
yet
delightfully
refreshing
a
real
winner
the
flavors
seem
a
bit
diluted
especially
considering
the
milky
consistency
and
the
bold
malty
smell
its
not
really
a
problem
when
i
sip
it
but
if
i
drink
a
little
fasterwhich
it
really
invites
with
the
carbonation
and
the
thin
sweet
tastei
end
up
missing
most
of
the
flavor
that
said
once
ive
gotten
used
to
the
wateriness
it
becomes
actually
quite
nice
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
without
sacrificing
flavor
complexity
only
strength

come
back
to
this
one

a

mild
in

but
not

this

the
across

board
3
5s
to
me
spell
out
booring
its
not
bad
beer
but
its
hard
to
be
enthusiastic
about
this
beer
and
this
beer
company
in

and
think
of
it
as
hand
crafted
reallywhy
bother
drinking
a

unless
you
cant
find
something
better
i
can
drinkability
the
ale
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
good
intro
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
dark
beer
its
a
big
so
what
very
drinkable
i
coud
have
several
drinkability
is
also
good
i
could
easily
drink
several
but
i
might
hold
back
as
there
are

minigrowler
yields

nearly
opaque
black
pour
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
big
roasted
notes
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
as
well
as
some
caramel
sweeetness
and
some
lightly
bitter
floral
hops
the
flavor
also
starts
out
with
some
nice
roastiness
expresso
and
dark
chocolate
along
with
some
toasted
bread
caramel
floral
and
mineraly
hops
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
appropriate
for
the
style
while
drinkability
is
slightly
lacking
this
is
a
well
constructed
schwarzbier
tasty
and
complex
cheers
to
matt

for
a
fine

well
its
going

ill

a

picking
up
not

give

a

youre
regular
dark

drinker
would
be
happy
with
this
offering
this
is
best
at
a
warmer
temperature
solid
all
around
and
quite
the
enjoyable
and
drinkable
schwarzbier
ive
ignored
this
beer
too
many
times
12oz
bottle
poured
out
brownish
black
it
had
very
little
head
it
smelled
like
malt
and
chocolate
its
flavor
was
sweet
and
malty
the
malt
flavor
really
stood
out
it
also
had
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
very
sharp
it
went
down
smooth
and
was
quite
drinkable
the
first
schwarzbier
that
i
ever
tried
was
sam
adams
black
lager
which
i
liked
a
lot
it
made
me
very
curious
of
what
other
beers
in
this
style
tasted
like
so
far
this
has
been
the
only
other
beer
that
ive
been
able
to
find
in
the
style
and
although
its
a
good
beer
it
pales
in
comparison
not
a
lot
of
oomph
or
complexity
here
but
straightforward
and
would
complement
some
junky
food
well
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
pours
with
a
brownishtan
head
that
doesnt
get
very
big
or
last
for
long
very
dark
only
letting
you
see
hints
of
reddishbrown
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
spicy
malty
aroma
but
not
too
strong
of
an
aroma
overall
taste
follows
with
the
same
spicy
malty
flavor
also
not
too
strong
very
light
bodied
in
the
mouth
for
a
porter
to
me
this
seems
to
be
a
subpar
porter
nothing
really
special
to
offer
and
not
even
as
good
as
i
hoped
it
to
be
wow
actually
after
reviewing
three
other
saranac
products
this
brew
actually
has
some
aromatics
to
it
barely
mediumdark
coffee
colored
with
a
short
lived
offwhite
head
this
brew
has
a
nose
of
sweet
slightly
roasted
malts
with
a
touch
of
caramel
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
slightly
acidic
and
lean
generally
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
slightly
oily
finish
this
is
a
good
grubfood
kinda
beer
you
know
burgers
and
the
like
anything
with
fat
as
the
slightly
acidic
nature
of
this
brew
will
cut
through
it
providing
relative
refreshment
from
this
relatively
decent
beer
it
wont
irritate
you
nor
will
it
impress
you
overall
it
was
disappointing
there
are
better
more
complex
examples
of
this
style
this
was
weak
a
32
ounce
growler
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
coffeecolored
head
it
had
a
sweet
roasted
grain
odor
and
tasted
the
same
with
some
hops
rather
nondescript
taste
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
that
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
very
drinkable
for
its
style

is
pretty
good
im
a
fan
of
the
style
and
could
kick
back
with
a
6er
of
this
for
some
ncaa
action
quite
happily
maybe
intended
to
be
a
stout
until
the
malts
and
body
didnt
show
up
nevertheless
good
for
a
schwarz
a
thin
roasted
grain
flavor
and
texture
takes
on
boldness
upfront
then
disipates
to
a
lighter
body
and
finish
would
be
chalky
or
coallike
if
not
for
a
moderate
malt
sweetness
that
is
displayed
mildly
over
the
roasted
graininess
still
lacks
the
clean
quality
in
the
finish
and
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
dominant
still
a
good
brew
if
you
like
the
flavor
of
a
stout
without
the
chewy
texture
medium
body
with
a
high
degree
of
carbonation
ill
pass
on
this
one
again
as
it
fits
the
bill
with
most
of
the
rest
of
the

an
enjoyable
beer
if
not
one
of
the
better
schwarzbiers
out
there
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
recently
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
bottle
out
of
the
holiday
pack
and
good
alternative
for
those
who
dont
like
bitter
stouts
or
porters
if
only
the
other
brews
in
the
holiday
pack
so
far
measured
up
to
this
this
beer
pours
a
somewhat
dark
color
out
of
the
bottle
as
is
to
be
hoped
for
the
tannish
head
is
moderate
but
short
lasting
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
also
malty
with
bitter
undertones
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
watery
not
worth
searching
out
but
if
the
opportunity
presents
give
it
a
try
okay
so
it
pours
out
a
dark
black
with
a
red
hue
to
the
edges
has
a
thin
flimsy
collar
of
foam
on
top
slightly
off
white
in
color
not
that
impressive
of
a
look
to
it
it
is
a
very
sweet
smelling
beer
with
good
hop
feel
to
it
very
sweet
tasting
beer
definitely
a
caramel
undernote
with
some
sweet
piney
hops
to
it
tasty
a
good
standard
but
nothing
exceptional
the
mouthfeel
is
great
very
light
and
unoffensive
it
has
a
nice
flavor
but
none
of
the
body
great
when
you
want
something
light
as
a
result
this
is
a
very
drinkable
super
drinkable
beer
rubied
brown
with
a
big
foamy
beige
head
that
steadily
fades
to
a
sticky
cap
doughy
yeast
and
caramel

aromas
mingle
with
a
leafy

presence
starts
out
with
floral
noble
hops
and
sweetish
nutty
malts
with
somewhat
of
a
mineral
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and

lingering
bitterness
but
the

nuttiness
persists
as
well
eminently
drinkable
a
solid
offering
ill
certainly
look
for
again
my
first

enjoyed
this
one
will
and
seek
out

upfront
with
a
chocolate
malt
sweetness
a
dry
english
hop
aftertaste
creates
a
superb
balance
while
keeping
the
finish
more
bitter
than
residual
sweet
the
carbonation
is
medium
and
the
body
is
light
giving
the
mouthfeel
just
enough
crisp
to
keep
the
rich
malts
from
becoming
slick
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
healthy
dose
of
rich
malt
and
bitter
hops
the
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
was
malt
with
a
tanin
bite
it
was
neither
sweet
nor
hoppy
the
body
was
medium
and
dry
this
was
a
bit
disappointing
the
label
sold
it
as
a
dark
spiced
lager
so
i
reviewed
it
as
such
getting
on
here
and
seeing
it
listed
as
a
schwartzbier
it
might
make
some
difference
although
i
didnt
pick
up
any
smokieness
i
wasnt
impressed
and
i
doubt
i
would
try
it
again
to
me
it
was
an
example
of
the
big
fib
the
look
and
aroma
said
sweet
dark
fruits
but
the
taste
only
delivered
a
washed
out
tanin
flavor
pours
almost
black
with
hints
of
red
tan
head
thick
and
tall
also
stays
a
bit
and
fades
to
a
thin
lace
aroma
is
malt
and
something
sweet
chocolate
caramel
mild
notes
of
hops
noted
taste
is
sweet
but
not
a
uncanny
sweet
but
a
nice
malt
sweetness
hints
of
nuts
and
a
touch
of
hops
mixed
in
thin
feel
in
the
mouth
nothing
overwhelming
to
brag
about
but
an
ok
brew
this
is
a
yet
another
solid
saranac
beer
it
is
very
damn
drinkable
i
would
love
to
buy
sixpacks
of
this
does
it
come
in
sixpacks
but
i
cant
get
it
locally
okay
i
might
be
able
to
get
this
one
in
iowa
i
will
buy
more
the
next
time
i
see
some
this
offering
was
part
of
a
12beer
sampler
that
i
purchased
in
lawrence
ks
very
good
stuff
try
one
overall
my
first
saranac
from
the
12
pack
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
one
as
ive
heard
its
their
best
but
i
must
say
im
disappointed
its
still
an
ok
beer
though
id
never
buy
it
on
my
own
again
the
carbonation
and
body
were
really
nice
there
was
no
roughness
and
the
body
was
just
thick
enough
to
match
the
taste
the
taste
and
smell
were
fairly
interesting
and
i
kept
sniffing
it
to
figure
out
what
that
smell
i
could
place
was
definitely
something
i
will
buy
again
and
drink
more
than
one
of
just
less
than
astounding
this
is
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
not
overly
complicated
or
bold
just
a
good
ol
fashioned
black
lager
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
a
good
sessionable
beer
plenty
of
flavor
without
being
beer
crack
a
good
session
beer
for
when
youre
planning
on
having
more
than
one
this
was
nice
drank
it
after
a
long
day
outside
in
the
cold
a
good
winter
beer
no
head
laces
the
glass
well
nice
deep
amber
color
sweet
aromas
nice
sweet
notes
good
malty
flavor
with
a
sweet
caramel
finish
very
clean
and
smoothe
it
was
very
tasty
drinability
is
good
also
due
to
the
light
feel
it
is
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
a
good
mix
d
goes
down
easily
would
make
a
good
breakfast
beer
for
those
who
start
their
mornings
right
i
never
tried
a
saranac
beer
before
for
the
price
i
couldnt
pass
up
the
twelve
beers
of
winter
if
half
of
the
others
are
about
this
good
then
it
was
money
well
spent
i
woldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
again
but
its
a
cool
style
id
definitely
like
to
see
more
examples
just
not
from
the
utica
crew
just
got
finished
decorating
the
tree
so
time
for
a
cold
one
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
red
with
a
1
finger
head
and
good
lace
smells
of
a
fruity
caramel
malt
more
sweet
than
roasty
cherry
and
plum
with
hints
of
vanilla
fruity
taste
again
with
cherry
and
plum
and
some
roasted
malt
but
not
as
much
as
you
would
think
for
a
beer
this
dark
nice
roasted
bitterness
hops
are
detectable
but
not
predominate
crisp
and
somewhat
refreshing
i
think
i
would
like
another
a
decent
brew
this
beers
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
an
interesting
schwarzbier
not
overly
complex
but
it
is
fairly
drinkable
somehow
this
beer
separates
itself
from
the
very
average
array
of
saranac
beers
still
nothing
too
spectacular
but
worth
a
try
at
least
this
beer
is
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
have
tried
the
mouthfeel
is
incredible
it
poured
out
with
a
small
head
it
is
a
very
deep
brown
in
color
the
smell
is
of
toasted
grain
possibly
some
caramel
notes
in
there
as
well
that
taste
is
outstanding
as
well
not
very
bitter
just
very
smooth
the
mouthfell
as
mentioned
above
is
near
the
top
in
my
book
this
style
of
beer
lends
itself
to
being
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
these
all
night
this
is
a
great
beer
i
bought
a
sampler
and
now
cant
wait
to
try
others
by
saranac
all
and
all
a
descent
version
of
this
style
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
solid
drinkable
brew
from
saranac
i
could
make
a
session
out
of
this
with
some
push
this
could
be
excellent
but
as
it
is
its
pretty
good
and
i
could
definitely
drink
some
more
this
is
the
best
beer
out
of
the
sampler
pack
by
far
it
had
a
very
thickfluffy
head
that
had
great
head
retention
the
body
was
a
very
dark
amber
color
almost
black
when
you
looked
at
it
a
certain
way
the
smell
was
alright
just
nothing
was
too
overbearing
so
it
all
worked
together
smoothly
there
were
hints
of
hops
some
lightly
roasted
malts
some
faint
spices
and
some
darker
fruits
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
better
again
everything
worked
together
well
but
the
caramel
malts
were
evident
as
well
as
the
little
hop
finish
it
had
very
creamy
beer
coated
the
mouth
nicely
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
heavier
but
instead
i
got
a
dark
beer
that
was
pretty
light
and
easy
to
drink
i
know
thats
a
common
misconception
among
beers
sometimes
because
it
was
prooved
wrong
here
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
this
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
small
one
finger
tannish
head
as
with
all
saranac
beers
the
head
is
small
and
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
has
a
slight
roasted
malt
scentbut
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
little
malty
with
coffee
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
flat
coke
with
iced
coffee
in
it
its
not
badbut
sam
adams
version
is
much
better
the
mf
is
lightweakand
watery
this
is
my
12th
of
a
saranac
winter
12
pack
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
brewerand
i
really
cant
imagine
having
another
saranac
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
but
with
a
lightness
and
carbination
that
keeps
it
from
being
mistaken
for
its
dark
breathren
probably
my
favorite
brew
from
saranac
can
remember
back
to
my
college
days
when
this
would
be
on
tap
and
only
on
tap
we
would
be
so
excited
when
that
happened
and
would
camp
out
at
either
duffs
or
maxfields
up
in
potsdam
well
it
has
been
many
moons
since
then
but
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
brews
for
a
number
of
reasons
the
memories
the
price
and
that
it
is
a
good
brew
pours
to
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aromas
of
dark
malts
lead
to
chocolate
and
coffee
scents
along
with
some
noticeable
hops
the
taste
is
very
good
malt
dominates
up
front
highlighting
chocolate
coffee
and
nuttiness
flavors
also
notice
a
hop
sense
in
my
mouth
even
after
i
am
done
with
the
sip
not
over
powering
at
all
but
it
is
there
in
the
background
a
fantastic
brew
and
one
that
will
always
remain
one
of
my
favorites
not
super
drinkable
im
not
flying
through
it
during
the
review
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
oppressive
as
is
something
maybe
a
little
sour
in
the
taste
as
the
pint
is
drained
nothing
great
i
guess
it
is
a
pretty
stock
schwarzbier
not
bad
just
not
the
bomb
mouthfeel
could
be
friendlier
bottle

thin
and
there
is
a
definite
lack
of
coffee
in
here
not
bad
but
not
close
to
being
great
either
drinkability
its
easy
to
down
a
couple
of
these
and
its
a
beer
i
could
drink
daily
quite
refreshing
perhaps
this
is
because
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
undercarbonated
or
like
juice
in
the
mouth
and
cheeks
it
does
feel
intentional
and
this
is
a
great
addition
to
the
subtlety
of
the
flavor
too
much
carbonation
with
be
undrinkable
here
it
was
just
the
opposite
its
nothing
to
write
the
international
beer
judging
committee
about

it
is
a
very
nice
product

day
in
nc
d
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
day
i
would
say
mmm
this
is
a
special
one
this
pours
a
nice
dark
borwn
with
a
little
red
tint
to
it
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
the
smell
is
light
but
noticeable
faintly
is
coffee
and
caramel
in
the
taste
the
toasted
malts
come
through
and
it
finishes
off
sorta
bitter
sorta
hoppy
very
crisp
but
creamy
at
the
same
time
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
yet
moderate
i
could
drink
many
of
these
overall
not
bad
definitely
a
nice
choice
black
with
dark
cherry
tones
small
quickly
dissipating
white
head
there
is
little
in
the
nose
either
good
or
bad
taste
is
slightly
malty
up
front
with
a
mild
anise
finish
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
the
flavor
lingers
for
a
minute
or
so
this
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
were
having
it
with
german
sausages
and
kraut
for
lunch
the
mouthdfeel
is
medium
good
malt
spine
with
light
caramel
toasty
malts
bucking
toned
back
grassy
hops
finish
is
wet
with
some
cocoa
tones
very
tastey
and
thrist
quenching
the
two
characteristis
one
needs
in
a
schwarzbier
this
is
as
good
as
kostritzer
any
day
the
foamy
2
tan
head
fades
to
a
12
trace
and
leaves
bubbly
lacing
on
the
glass
this
dark
opaque
beer
reveals
a
red
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
raisins
deep
and
earthy
though
maybe
a
touch
of
citrus
develops
as
it
breathes
the
taste
is
similar
not
much
up
front
mostly
raisin
and
dark
malt
in
the
middle
and
end
and
slight
piney
hops
appearing
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
somewhat
dry
adequate
carbonation
though
it
could
handle
more
by
this
time
the
head
is
gone
but
thick
lacing
remains
this
is
a
narrow
beer
with
both
the
scent
and
taste
consisting
entirely
of
dark
earthy
bitter
tones
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
just
a
little
smoky
malt
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
and
absolutely
nothing
up
front
in
my
opinion
though
it
is
quite
good
and
drinkable
i
would
want
to
switch
to
something
more
wellrounded
after
one
or
maybe
two
of
these
at
most
a
good
beer
to
try
but
have
something
else
around
as
well
this
an
ok
beer
but
ive
had
way
better
schwarzbiers
i
just
kind
of
got
into
the
style
after
trying
a
monschoff
spelling
it
seems
to
be
different
everywhere
at
the
moan
and
dove
this
one
lacks
a
little
bit
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
with
some
red
showing
through
looks
thin
though
smell
is
fairly
subdued
a
little
malty
and
grassy
taste
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
its
pretty
one
dimensional
and
at
that
its
not
really
even
that
impressive
malty
sweet
and
caramely
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
way
too
watery
and
none
of
the
complexities
i
look
for
in
a
beer
of
this
style
its
kind
of
a
little
syrupy
like
a
coke
or
something
not
really
worth
it
but
i
guess
its
a
relatively
cheap
fallback
beer
nearly
black
in
color
with
a
transparent
red
body
offwhite
head
bordering
on
tan
in
color
which
disappeared
quickly
smell
is
of
toasted
sweet
malts
with
some
chocolate
characters
again
i
pick
up
a
common
aroma
ive
detected
in
all
of
the
saranac
brews
that
i
just
cant
seem
to
place
its
almost
a
bit
metallic
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
on
this
one
initially
a
bit
of
toasted
malts
coming
through
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
the
flavor
is
very
crisp
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
and
relatively
medium
to
full
bodied
this
is
the
first
of
the
sampler
pack
ive
reviewed
which
i
would
say
i
would
be
glad
to
drink
more
of
ok
im
editing
this
review
because
i
had
another
bottle
and
it
was
much
better
didnt
have
that
metallic
ass
taste
though
it
still
had
a
slightly
metallic
finish
texture
was
much
better
and
it
had
a
nice
soft
carbonation
that
the
first
bottle
didnt
have
bad
cap
maybe
also
more
fruity
that
i
remember
the
first
bottle
being
oelergud
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
i
think
this
could
make
it
into
my
top
10
if
it
was
more
readily
available
at
home
drinkabilitycomments
highly
drinkable
and
a
good
representative
of
the
style
while
its
no
köstritzer
this
is
a
fine
beer
saranacs
best
in
my
opinion
drinkability
and
overall
saranacs
best
without
a
doubt
smooth
fruity
and
enough
complexity
to
keep
most
every
palate
drinking
i
only
had
one
schwarzbier
before
this
and
it
was
spechers
black
bavarian
and
i
loved
it
as
well
good
beer
i
would
definitely
go
back
for
more
of
this
one
sampled
a
12
ouncer
that
came
in
the
holiday
12
pack
no
freshness
dating
to
be
found
pours
dark
brown
tan
head
minimal
lacing
and
just
a
faint
coffee
nose
cant
say
im
overly
impressed
with
this
one
why
do
so
many
of
the
dark
beers
from
saranac
taste
so
similar
seems
they
put
a
differant
label
on
about
8
beers
but
the
contents
all
are
so
similar
drinkable
middle
of
the
road
stuff
but
nothing
to
seek
out
pours
a
deep
black
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thick
coffeecolored
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
deep
roasted
malt
aroma
with
notes
of
mocha
and
maple
nice
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
sweet
roasted
malt
dominates
the
palate
accented
by
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
fig
not
much
aftertaste
very
drinkable
a
very
pleasant
beer
the
first
from
saranac
that
i
actually
craved
more
of
when
i
was
done
nice
job
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
particular
beer
it
is
drinkable
but
rather
bland
and
watery
the
head
was
minimal
and
short
lived
no
lacing
whatsoever
the
color
was
rich
and
somewhat
attractive
though
the
smell
and
taste
were
rather
bland
compared
with
thier
other
offerings
only
complaint
and
this
seems
to
be
very
noticable
lately
for
me
with
the
saranac
line
of
beers
is
that
their
beers
taste
watered
down
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
thin
if
they
could
bulk
this
beer
up
a
little
more
it
would
do
wonders
a
pretty
good
domestic
version
of
the
style
which
makes
this
one
worth
trying
on
its
own
nothing
special
but
not
unpleasant
or
obtrusive
either
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
dark
tanlight
brown
head
above
the
dark
mahogany
brew
head
fades
but
doesnt
totally
disappear
and
lacing
is
the
best
of
the
saranacs
ive
reviewed
to
date
aroma
is
sweet
dark
malts
with
some
fruit
tinges
as
well
taste
consists
of
fleeting
dark
malt
bitterness
giving
way
to
a
slightly
sour
fruit
note
and
then
back
to
some
malt
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
for
a
schwarzbier
but
drinkability
goes
up
a
notch
because
of
same
nice
brew
from
saranac
brew
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
into
a
logo
pint
glass
very
little
head
though
it
was
a
nice
shade
of
beige
a
slightly
sweet
bouquet
is
present
just
a
barely
perceptible
hint
of
roasted
carmel
taste
was
dissapointingly
flat
with
no
strong
flavors
coming
to
the
forefront
it
remains
a
wellbrewed
lager
style
not
sure
how
it
got
the
schwarzbier
label
in
ba
mouthfeel
was
not
engaging
nor
was
it
objectionable
brew
was
easy
to
drink
down
as
there
is
nothing
present
to
really
endear
or
distain
the
fourth
beer
of
christmas
one
of
the
better
saranac
offerings
ive
had
a
dark
brooding
sort
of
burgandy
that
borders
on
black
im
most
struck
by
the
authenticity
of
the
beer
great
flavor
with
a
nice
smooth
somewhat
thin
german
lager
body
lots
of
caramel
in
the
aromas
and
in
the
flavor
profile
maybe
a
little
sweet
at
points
but
the
leafy
german
hops
balance
it
all
out
nicely
i
love
schwarzbiers
and
this
is
not
at
all
a
bad
rendition
in
my
book
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
expected
pours
a
very
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
has
a
nice
sweet
maybe
slightly
fruity
smell
to
it
not
overpowering
in
taste
by
anymeans
but
saying
that
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
taste
not
an
overly
distinguishable
beer
but
a
decent
drinkable
beer
and
a
good
fallback
if
you
cant
think
of
anything
else
to
drink
dark
appearance
some
grassy
hop
flavour
the
schwarzbier
style
is
passable
and
this
is
typical
for
it
not
missing
anything
here
or
for
most
octoberfest
beers
ontap
at
clarks
ale
house
6
somewhat
sweet
and
a
touch
of
roast
doesnt
work
for
me
appearance
is
very
dark
brown
with
a
slight
reddish
tint
as
you
peer
through
the
glass
and
see
light
on
the
other
side
small
foamy
head
developed
from
moderate
pour
and
it
went
down
but
left
a
nice
ring
about
the
glass
seems
very
carbonated
and
looks
like
coke
nice
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
aroma
nice
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
liitle
disappointing
because
of
too
much
carbonation
i
cant
really
shake
the
idea
of
this
being
a
coke
aftertaste
however
is
pleasant
with
hints
of
nuttiness
overall
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
i
hoped
the
name
black
forest
just
sounds
nice
appears
darker
than
a
porter
yet
light
than
a
stout
this
bavarian
style
held
little
head
or
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
slight
hops
with
a
hint
of
caramel
very
active
in
the
mouth
not
sure
what
schwarzbier
or
bavarian
style
is
like
at
its
best
but
this
was
a
mit
malty
bitter
and
with
a
slight
bit
of
sweetness
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
my
first
experience
with
this
style
i
was
a
little
skeptical
at
first
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
hope
to
find
some
others
of
this
style
in
the
future
many
say
that
this
is
saranacs
best
it
is
one
of
their
better
ones
but
i
feel
that
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
beer
and
it
simply
didnt
seem
deep
enough
for
me
i
would
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
if
given
the
chance
i
dont
see
this
particular
saranac
around
too
much
in
my
area
overalla
hard
style
to
find
even
harder
to
master
ive
heard
yet
this
is
a
more
than
solid
beer
that
definitely
needs
to
be
on
your
wish
list
in
the
winter
goes
fine
with
many
meats
and
breads
or
even
better
on
its
own
a
great
beer
beer
is
good
happy
beering
drinkability
and
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
this
was
my
first
schwarzbier
and
i
will
come
back
for
more
i
like
the
fact
that
its
a
dark
complex
beer
but
its
not
so
heavy
and
overpowering
which
forces
the
drinkability
to
suffer
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
my
russian
imperials
but
this
would
make
for
a
nice
session
a
decent
schwarzbier
something
in
this
brew
limits
its
drinkability
it
just
doesnt
appease
to
me
tonight
seems
very
average
in
most
respects
schwarzbier
may
be
a
rare
style
here
in
the
us
but
perhaps
its
rare
for
a
reason
its
just
not
something
i
would
care
to
drink
very
often
despite
this
its
a
wellcrafted
brew
from
the
boys
at
saranac
had
this
on
tap
at
hard
times
in
herndon
virginia
this
came
out
looking
a
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
when
the
light
caught
it
just
right
there
was
a
light
tan
head
that
wasnt
much
more
than
a
collar
that
left
some
lace
in
patches
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malts
and
fruit
mainly
there
was
a
light
hop
aroma
complementing
the
malt
this
one
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
nuts
and
a
slightly
tart
finish
a
little
too
sweet
at
times
for
my
taste
this
has
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
and
a
lingering
taste
first
time
having
this
style
of
beer
so
i
was
not
sure
to
expect
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
shall
seek
out
more
this
style
drinkability
um
whatever
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
if
they
decide
to
go
back
and
make
this
only
available
on
tap
again
i
wont
miss
it
an
excellent
brew
by
saranac
i
almost
wish
all
12
of
the
beers
in
the
pack
were
black
forests
but
i
am
excited
to
try
the
others
as
well
this
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
would
definitely
get
it
on
a
regular
basis
highly
recommened
enjoy
if
you
can
find
it
give
it
a
go
black
forest
practically
lives
up
to
its
name
in
appearance
pouring
dark
brown
and
blending
to
a
pitch
black
color
a
thick
tan
head
forms
over
your
glass
and
fades
rather
fast
this
beer
smells
of
caramel
and
sugar
and
lacked
any
distinct
aromatic
quality
though
i
thought
the
sugar
i
smelled
was
maple
black
forest
starts
smooth
and
soft
it
is
fullbodied
with
oat
and
caramel
flavors
a
malty
sweetness
is
present
throughout
the
entire
drink
this
beer
finishes
oily
wet
and
saves
its
sharpest
flavor
bite
of
all
for
the
last
few
drops
on
your
tongue
finally
this
beers
aftertaste
is
fortunately
mild
but
it
has
a
tendency
to
sit
on
your
tongue
for
quite
a
while
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
so
i
have
absolutely
nothing
to
compare
it
to
i
enjoyed
it
but
considering
the
averageness
of
the
other
saranac
beers
that
i
have
had
i
am
sure
that
there
are
much
better
renditions
of
the
style
to
be
had
thinner
than
id
like
this
dark
beer
is
flavorful
aromatic
and
very
drinkable
nothing
really
stands
out
as
exceptional
or
bad
it
is
smooth
and
well
balanced
but
not
exactly
exciting
this
is
my
first
try
with
the
schwarzbier
style
and
overall
i
like
it
pours
a
very
dark
near
black
color
except
in
light
there
is
red
elements
head
is
moderate
and
frothy
off
white
smells
like
a
dark
lager
sweet
and
crisp
taste
is
interesting
almost
like
a
herbed
beer
not
very
sweet
and
not
very
hoppy
but
a
distinct
taste
of
cinnamon
mint
hard
to
place
not
bad
and
recommendable
but
not
my
favorite
char
this
beer
is
my
first
step
into
the
world
of
schwarzbiers
i
dont
care
much
for
it
the
appearance
is
dark
and
cloudy
there
is
a
thin
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
there
is
a
sweet
carmel
taste
but
it
doesnt
come
through
too
much
there
seems
to
be
a
lack
of
maltiness
in
this
beer
that
makes
it
seem
watery
maybe
i
dont
know
enough
about
schwarzbiers
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
this
is
drinkable
beer
no
overly
bitter
of
off
flavors
and
a
pleasant
blend
of
flavors
another
solid
saranac
offering
pours
black
but
with
a
few
red
tints
thrown
in
there
with
a
light
slightly
offwhite
headnot
much
aroma
to
it
slight
chocolate
and
fruit
taste
is
pretty
lively
and
fruity
with
a
light
roasted
nut
flavor
as
well
well
a
better
than
average
brew
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
here
the
taste
started
to
a
light
floral
bitterness
which
continued
to
the
end
the
dark
chocolate
theme
continued
but
quickly
balanced
well
to
the
malts
leaving
a
bittersweet
after
taste
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
is
is
good
it
boasts
of
roasted
barley
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
bit
of
yeasty
scent
the
taste
is
malty
and
smooth
it
has
a
creamy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
sessions
beer
a
real
good
drinker
this
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
dies
off
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
chocolate
malts
and
dark
fruits
the
flavor
is
complex
but
very
good
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
chocolate
malt
and
fruits
very
good
beer
im
not
very
experienced
with
schwarzbiers
i
would
have
though
this
was
a
porter
if
its
available
on
its
own
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
i
found
it
in
the
holiday
12
pack
i
know
what
ill
be
looking
for
on
my
next
trip
to
lake
placid
appearance
deep
ruby
brown
almost
black
if
not
held
up
to
the
light
forms
a
very
nice
mountainous
tan
chunky
head
leaves
behind
thick
coating
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
delicate
toasted
malts
paired
with
very
nice
herbal
german
hallertau
hops
in
there
they
definitely
arise
in
the
aroma
taste
perfect
blend
of
sweetness
from
the
dark
roasted
and
caramel
malts
kicks
up
the
hop
flavor
very
much
so
authentic
tasting
just
tasted
a
schwarzbier
from
the
subsidary
of
kulmbacher
yesterday
and
this
is
even
more
drinkable
and
more
favorfully
hopped
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
body
in
the
spectrum
but
has
a
nice
soft
carbonation
not
overcabonated
at
all
drinkability
best
of
the
bunch
from
saranac
i
definitely
am
going
to
pick
up
a
sixer
while
supplies
last
down
the
street
at
the
liquor
store
good
brew
to
have
on
hand
drinkability
this
is
not
a
style
i
can
claim
much
familiarity
with
but
this
example
seems
a
bit
too
anemic
and
acidic
to
be
truly
great
good
yes
great
no
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
but
i
wouldnt
set
up
a
trade
for
it
my
first
introduction
to
the
schwarzbier
style
this
is
an
excellent
complex
brew
that
ill
try
to
track
down
more
of
kudos
to
saranac
for
including
this
in
their
winter
12
pack
my
3rd
bottle
out
of
the
2003
12
beer
sampler
box
pours
a
rich
dark
mahogany
with
garnet
hues
around
the
edges
of
the
pint
glass
beige
head
is
decent
enough
and
hangs
around
long
enough
to
leave
some
delicate
lacing
nose
is
surprisingly
impressive
chocolate
malt
dark
fruit
and
some
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
well
balanced
taste
is
complex
with
hints
of
rye
bread
chocolate
malt
and
currants
a
likeable
speciman
here
exceeded
my
expectations
for
a
brewery
that
puts
so
many
styles
in
one
box
a
thick
rich
head
adorns
this
deep
blood
red
beer
a
smell
of
coffee
and
chocolate
i
guess
that
would
be
mochagives
me
high
hope
and
anticipation
for
whats
to
come
a
semi
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
perfectly
matching
the
smell
creamy
and
very
palatable
i
amy
very
impressed
good
job
saranac
you
have
done
it
again
deep
dark
brown
beer
with
a
caramel
hue
thick
foamy
light
brown
head
leaves
a
solid
ring
of
lace
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
aroma
light
caramel
malt
in
there
as
well
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
solid
hoppy
backbone
well
balanced
and
tasty
barely
bitter
carbonated
aftertaste
the
body
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
a
pretty
good
beer
that
saves
the
day
in
many
drinking
establishments
across
central
ny
overall
a
decent
schwarzbier
that
i
would
recommend
i
dont
like
schwarzbier
i
like
this
though
so
its
hard
to
tell
if
this
is
a
bad
schwarz
or
a
good
roasted
porter
with
a
thin
body
the
taste
isnt
burnt
its
heavy
on
roasted
and
gets
its
bitterness
from
black
patent
instead
of
hops
or
so
it
seems
finishes
clean
but
then
a
tart
feeling
sneaks
in
at
the
end
sort
of
a
dark
wheat
but
has
charecteristics
that
keep
it
out
of
that
class
too
a
tough
beer
to
judge
an
easy
beer
to
drink
dark
clear
chestnut
hue
dogged
pitted
dark
beige
head
leaves
muddled
lace
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
dry
bakers
chocolate
subtle
carob
and
dark
lovibond
caramel
malt
with
a
roasted
tinge
trace
herbal
hop
twang
toasty
munich
malt
sweetness
upfront
in
flavor
yields
to
rounded
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
smooth
perhaps
dehusked
chocolate
malt
surprisingly
assertive
roasted
grain
bitterness
lends
a
refreshing
carbonaceous
dryness
hop
bitterness
is
appropriately
mild
and
adequates
tapers
residual
sweetness
understated
herbaceous
hop
flavor
darts
in
late
along
with
hints
of
cola
like
caramel
unfortunately
thin
in
overall
body
like
most
of
saranacs
brews
with
a
lanky
over
attenuated
mouthfeel
finishes
with
wisps
of
salty
grainy
toast
but
otherwise
clean
and
abruptly
quite
an
enjoyable
and
unique
take
on
the
style
with
an
agreeably
pronounced
roasted
grain
presence
if
saranac
fermented
this
with
their
ale
yeast
it
would
surpass
their
stout
in
all
respects
quaffable
indeed
give
it
a
shot
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
produced
some
lacing
through
the
drink
a
slight
roasted
smell
was
detectable
the
roasted
malt
was
most
prevelent
with
a
slight
hint
of
bitterness
somewhat
thin
bodied
and
slighlty
crisp
on
the
tongue
the
roasted
malt
lasts
into
the
aftertaste
for
a
short
time
drinkable
but
overall
an
average
attempt
in
this
style
very
decent
schwarzbier
especially
from
an
economy
craft
brewer
such
as
saranac
i
found
it
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
malty
taste
with
hints
of
caramel
sweetness
at
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
hops
i
dont
know
if
i
would
go
running
out
to
buy
more
when
there
are
so
many
better
beers
to
choose
from
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
this
is
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
that
sticks
in
my
mind
maybe
the
fact
that
there
are
so
few
schwarzbiers
on
the
market
to
compare
it
to
have
left
it
in
a
sort
of
gray
area
in
my
mind
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
college
when
i
needed
a
wellpriced
but
interesting
beer
id
probably
even
say
it
was
one
of
the
main
players
in
my
transition
to
quality
craftbrewed
beer
so
it
has
a
warm
place
in
my
heart
and
i
feel
validated
to
say
that
i
can
honestly
still
enjoy
it
for
the
same
reasons
i
used
to
even
after
having
learned
a
great
deal
more
about
beer
since
that
time
ich
will
ein
mehr
a
very
delicous
reasonably
priced
dark
lager
it
starts
off
with
a
nice
sweetness
that
segeues
into
a
restrained
but
noticable
hoppiness
for
a
wonderfully
balanced
full
tasting
beer
i
dont
think
they
could
make
this
beer
any
better
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
values
out
there
not
the
greatest
schwarzbier
in
the
world
but
i
still
like
it
and
it
definitely
hits
the
spot
simple
and
light
its
good
to
have
beer
that
you
dont
have
to
pay
quite
so
much
attention
to
and
just
enjoy
good
company
easily
my
favorite
from
saranac
as
a
rule
i
enjoy
most
of
saranacs
output
as
session
brews
and
at
parties
where
economy
comes
into
play
this
one
is
my
favorite
of
them
all
since
it
is
one
of
the
darkest
and
heartiest
that
they
brew
all
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
grain
with
a
nice
hop
balance
that
leaves
minimal
bitter
aftertaste
the
finish
is
relatively
dry
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
the
style
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
a
little
smoother
overall
one
of
the
best
you
can
try
from
the
matt
brewing
co
s
line
of
beers
deep
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
where
the
light
sneaks
through
the
head
rises
and
falls
quickly
leaving
a
layer
one
bubble
high
with
light
lacing
all
around
the
glass
smell
is
initially
of
raisin
some
sweet
malt
and
some
roasted
caramel
with
hints
of
hops
flavor
is
warm
and
rich
roasted
malt
and
molasses
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
slightest
hint
of
an
alcoholic
aftertaste
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
for
a
darker
beer
had
this
at
a
party
the
other
nightalways
nice
when
yuor
friends
decide
to
buy
a
barrel
of
something
good
poured
a
deep
brown
with
plenty
of
ruby
around
the
edges
and
a
creamy
small
brown
head
smell
was
a
tad
indistinct
with
some
earthy
malts
and
sweet
caramel
as
well
taste
was
sweet
and
smooth
with
lots
of
chocolate
caramel
and
dampness
perfectly
tasty
beer
on
tap
i
also
like
the
bottles
light
brown
in
color
thin
yet
foamy
head
decent
retention
stringy
carbonation
noted
sweet
malty
and
some
floral
notes
on
the
nose
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
taste
noted
up
front
creamy
some
light
coffee
beans
noted
and
the
hops
come
through
nicely
towards
the
finish
a
light
toasty
finish
smooth
for
a
darker
beer
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
one
of
saranacs
top
brews
as
the
bold
print
so
clearly
notes
to
me
i
have
never
reviewed
this
type
of
beer
before
so
im
operating
a
bit
in
the
dark
which
is
not
altogether
bad
is
it
here
goes
while
not
overly
intricate
in
its
taste
this
was
a
refreshing
and
pleasant
brew
highly
carbonated
with
lots
of
gentle
sweetness
the
pour
is
dark
almost
black
no
duh
its
a
black
beer
and
the
head
though
thin
is
a
nice
contrast
the
smell
is
roasty
malt
tinted
with
ginger
the
taste
is
similar
on
the
label
they
advertise
caramel
malt
sweetness
medium
body
id
say
truth
in
advertising
and
id
have
another
thanks
to
unclejimbo
sending
it
out
great
looking
brew
it
is
dark
mahogany
looks
very
much
like
a
porter
two
fingers
plus
of
creamy
beige
head
diminishes
too
quickly
but
it
leaves
super
sticky
lacing
all
over
the
glass
nose
is
malt
and
some
caramel
squeaks
through
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
and
lots
of
it
little
balance
here
and
a
bit
thin
and
watery
surprising
taste
for
the
look
you
expect
lots
of
smoky
flavors
but
thats
not
what
this
is
about
its
smooth
sweet
and
all
about
malt
enjoyable
and
drinkable
it
is
a
good
beer
that
surprises
the
palate
just
a
bit
of
roastiness
creeps
in
at
the
end
strange
pick
for
matt
brewing
to
mass
produce
schwarzbier
it
was
just
about
a
black
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
stuck
around
nicely
also
had
good
germanstyle
natural
carbonation
rolls
on
the
tilt
the
nose
was
of
roasted
wheat
some
caramel
malt
taste
was
a
quiet
dark
malt
roasted
wheat
and
a
slight
fruit
from
the
hops
taste
had
a
thin
body
and
character
yet
a
nice
dryness
during
the
finish
though
it
fades
moderately
fast
almost
an
oily
mouthfeel
with
a
strange
feeling
cloy
after
the
finish
like
an
acid
burn
a
good
saranac
beer
it
may
have
been
if
they
hadnt
filtered
it
and
gone
through
with
the
heavy
elements
of
it
prosit
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
mediumsized
bubbly
tan
head
the
head
loses
its
retention
with
each
drink
leaving
a
thin
film
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
primarily
toasted
malt
and
a
caramel
there
was
a
nice
rich
sweetness
blended
well
with
the
malt
and
slightly
bitter
hops
flavor
the
finish
was
very
light
and
dry
this
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
and
quite
economical
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
hasnt
tried
this
style
a
great
offering
by
saranac
probably
their
best
yearround
beer
if
not
their
best
over
all
this
beer
poured
out
a
dark
and
rich
mahogany
color
the
head
was
a
good
size
creamy
and
tan
colored
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
in
the
aroma
there
is
a
nice
roastiness
in
the
flavor
a
little
bittersweetness
with
a
hint
of
green
apples
the
beer
was
light
to
medium
bodied
good
drinkability
and
an
overall
interesting
beer
i
would
have
this
again
this
is
the
most
flavorful
lager
i
have
ever
tasted
its
dark
yet
very
easy
to
drink
its
sweet
but
not
yucky
sweet
like
saranacs
caramel
porter
its
dark
but
not
heavy
this
is
my
favorite
saranac
beer
lately
my
buddies
and
i
have
been
keeping
six
packs
of
this
in
our
refrigerator
in
case
of
emergencies
wonderful
looking
gore
mtn
garnet
dark

sweet
and
appealing
smell
that
is
mostly
malty
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
hops
thrown
in
taste
is
very
smooth
and
crisp
very
enjoyable
this
is
easily
the
best
saranac
has
to
offer
and
is
even
better
if
you
can
find
it
ontap
dark
brownruby
in

with
a

creamy

nice

in
the
glass
very
appealing
sweet
malty
aroma
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
medium
body
to
the
beer
though
the
finish
starts
out
unsatisfyingly
light
almost
watery
things
improve
as
the
beer
warms
however
with
a
nice
toasty
aftertaste
developing
to
compensate
somewhat
for
the
thin
body
flavor
begins
with
a
strong
taste
of
caramel
malt
and
a
mild
too
mild
imho
roastiness
hop
flavor
is
understated
drinkable
beer
but
too
wimpy
to
be
a
a
great
schwarz
right
away
this
brew
is
looking
good
thick
the
only
light
to
penetrate
this
brew
comes
out
blood
red
other
than
that
its
black
hence
the
name
huge
frothy
head
looks
can
be
decieving
though
this
beer
is
about
as
thick
as
your
average
pale
ale
still
nice
but
no
motor
oil
here
smell
is
nice
malty
with
some
hops
peeking
through
a
decent
sweet
malt
taste
not
overbearing
at
all
drinkability
is
niice
here
not
a
big
beer
but
great
beer
f
pours
a
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights
and
comes
with
a
massive
tan
head
the
head
slowly
shrinks
down
into
a
lumpy
froth
that
lasts
and
lasts
the
smell
consists
of
faint
burnt
malt
and
a
slightly
twangy
hop
again
the
taste
is
also
slightly
faint
but
has
a
nice
combination
of
lightly
roasted
malt
and
an
earthy
grain
with
very
light
hops
it
is
incredibly
smooth
and
drinks
down
easy
it
is
light
bodied
and
finishes
just
a
lightly
dry
bitter
nice
brew
thanks
again
to
bigdeb
for
sending
me
this
brew
cheers
cheers
to
my
friend
bigdeb
for
this
sample
i
was
given
a
6
pack
of
saranacs
black
forest
by
a
guy
at
work
i
was
mislead
by
the
name
black
forest
assuming
it
would
be
real
dark
and
thick
upon
drinking
i
found
it
was
quite
the
opposite
i
had
a
nice
creamy
head
and
poured
a
brownishred
color
it
has
a
malty
taste
with
a
little
bite
upon
swallowing
a
little
taste
of
hops
and
wheat
but
nothing
overwhelming
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
not
quite
sure
what
we
were
drinking
here
the
color
was
dark
but
in
the
glass
wasnt
dark
enough
looked
like
someone
had
added
a
little
dark
food
coloring
couldnt
tell
if
this
was
a
lager
an
ale
or
whatever
no
discernable
taste
to
say
wow
about
wouldnt
try
it
again
unless
i
was
stuck
in
the
airport
and
this
was
all
there
was
an
awesome
awesome
brew
one
of
my
favorites
from
saranac
everytime
my
buddy
goes
home
to
fredonia
ny
i
always
give
him
cash
and
beg
him
to
bring
back
a
few
6ers
flavor
is
that
of
lighter
stout
but
carries
some
hoppiness
to
it
color
is
dark
but
not
super
dark
like
that
of
an
imperial
stout
or
even
a
heavy
porter
very
drinkable
i
think
its
pretty
light
for
the
flavor
it
packs
this
is
not
to
say
this
is
a
light
beer
by
any
means
or
stretch
of
words
a
very
enjoyable
brew
i
have
to
say
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
saranac
assorted
12
packs
prices
are
unfortunately
going
up
67
in
central
to
northern
jersey
great
session
beer
great
on
its
own
but
doesnt
really
stack
up
to
the
true
european
varieties
a
very
unique
and
satisfying
brew
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
full
big
bubbled
tan
head
that
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
good
lace
the
dark
malt
and
slightly
hoppy
aroma
is
surprisingly
apparent
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
level
and
lightly
creamy
mouthfeel
the
malt
flavor
is
apparent
up
front
mainly
of
a
very
nice
gently
sweet
caramel
backed
by
bittersweet
chocolate
as
it
crosses
the
palate
a
distinct
grassy
hop
flavor
comes
forth
a
solid
bitterness
that
never
oversteps
its
bounds
balances
the
palate
before
receeding
into
a
lightly
dry
finish
with
some
residual
chocolatelike
notes
an
exceptionally
well
done
beer
that
deserves
more
attention
taste
is
rather
unique
decently
hopped
like
other
saranac
styles
almost
to
a
point
of
fighting
with
the
caramel
malt
too
smooth
and
hoppy
and
not
bitter
enough
to
consider
a
stout
but
fits
the
ba
classification
of
schwarzbier
very
well
smooth
with
a
medium
body
that
i
would
just
love
to
fill
up
a
bit
the
roasty
malts
are
there
but
way
toned
down
the
grassy
flavor
is
also
a
bit
light
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
definitely
a
brew
that
you
could
have
a
few
of
ah
a
few
minutes
warmed
in
my
hands
and
a
touch
more
flavoring
comes
into
play
it
is
still
lacking
but
never
the
less
it
is
a
good
beer
this
brews
a
nice
garnet
color
with
a
good
creamy
head
problem
is
its
gone
within
a
minute
aroma
is
indistinguisable
seems
like
a
sour
fruity
aroma
that
is
out
of
place
for
this
style
taste
is
pretty
bland
the
only
positive
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
not
bad
the
tastes
that
i
perceive
are
all
slight
caramel
malt
and
a
grainy
dryness
this
beer
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
the
sprecher
black
bavarian
i
am
going
to
go
confirm
that
right
now
as
i
have
one
black
bavarian
in
the
fridge
almost
black
with
a
thick
and
solid
tan
head
roasty
on
the
nose
but
nothing
nice
smooth
and
malty
with
a
slight
hop
kick
when
chilled
it
has
an
odd
sharp
edge
on
your
tongue
let
it
warm
slightly
to
enjoy
as
in
threefour
minutes
before
the
pour
just
thick
enough
without
feeling
stoutish
i
really
like
this
beer
i
am
not
usually
privy
to
lagers
but
this
one
changed
my
views
a
beautiful
deep
amber
color
and
foamy
head
introduce
a
sweet
aroma
and
malt
flavor
that
is
unique
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
this
is
especially
good
for
those
who
wna
tto
have
the
health
benefits
of
a
dark
beer
but
not
the
body
of
an
dark
ale
this
was
the
beer
i
was
most
looking
forward
to
in
the
saranac
sampler
and
i
was
not
disappointed
i
have
entered
the
black
forest
and
am
never
returning
most
saranac
products
are
good
but
not
outstanding
this
is
an
exception
its
a
nicely
balanced
interesting
and
wellbrewed
beer
i
cant
find
any
faults
with
the
beer
and
its
terrific
to
see
a
large
regional
brewery
take
a
stab
at
an
uncommon
beer
style
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
nice
creamy
head
subtle
malt
and
light
noble
hop
aromas
great
smooth
malt
taste
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
brew
out
very
nicely
crisp
and
smooth
on
the
palate
and
highly
drinkable
a
few
more
breweries
need
to
brew
beers
like
this
notes
too
few
schwarzbiers
out
on
the
market
this
is
the
one
to
drink
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
top
shelf
now
this
is
a
good
beer
saranacs
best
in
my
opinion
dark
color
and
retentive
head
quick
malty
flavor
that
gradually
mellows
to
a
toasty
fade
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
nice
rounded
sweet
malt
flavors
good
stuff
the
color
was
deep
black
and
the
head
a
ambercaramel
brown
color
after
pouring
the
beer
into
my
glass
the
smell
look
was
even
more
inviting
on
the
nose
there
is
a
slight
roastiness
grainy
toasted
bread
aroma
on
the
palate
the
same
flavor
toasted
bread
caramel
nice
sweetness
th
is
my
favorite
from
the
saranac
line
of
brews
if
you
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
before
pouring
it
into
a
glass
it
will
bring
out
more
flavor
schwarzbiers
are
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
beer
style
its
to
bad
that
not
many
breweries
make
this
style
perhaps
i
forgot
to
turn
my
taste
buds
on
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
surprisingly
light
on
flavor
great
dark
color
but
almost
none
of
the
malty
sweetness
associated
with
a
schwarzbier
a
little
tart
and
astringent
up
front
and
then
it
just
sort
became
nondescript
in
overall
flavor
maybe
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
really
good
on
tap
but
does
not
bottle
well
i
would
sum
it
up
in
one
word
bland
impressive
brew
from
saranac
great
tan
head
laces
all
the
way
down
the
glass
as
you
pound
this
lip
smacking
beer
clean
crisp
roasted
malt
flavors
go
down
easily
with
a
pronounced
smooth
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
balanced
hop
bitterness
got
this
one
in
the
12
beers
of
christmas
case
rerate
im
lowering
my
rating
on
this
after
tasting
it
again
after
having
a
real
schwarzbier
herold
black
i
dont
know
if
the
saranac
itself
has
lost
some
of
its
oomph
or
if
the
bar
has
been
raised
because
of
my
experience
with
herold
but
this
beer
is
just
a
very
basic
example
of
the
style
didnt
really
like
this
one
it
was
dark
but
not
very
smoky
and
it
left
a
metallic
after
taste
that
i
just
didnt
enjoy
possibly
the
finest
american
made
schwarzbier
excellent
o
almost
an
amber
lager
like
a
vienna
with
a
hand
full
of
chocolate
malt
the
chocolate
character
is
pretty
light
and
would
benefit
from
more
support
from
complimenting
roasted
gain
character
ah
saranac
its
been
over
a
year
since
i
had
one
after
moving
from
ohio
good
college
memories
of
hanging
out
in
the
adirondacks
drinking
these
this
one
survived
the
journey
west
and
is
at
least
a
year
and
a
half
old
however
it
doesnt
seem
much
worse
for
the
wear
this
was
from
the
winter
seasonal
pack
i
believe
and
in
typical
saranac
fashion
the
seasonals
are
of
much
higher
quality
than
the
standard
fare
easy
drinking
that
stays
true
to
a
somewhat
rare
style
a
bargain
for
less
than
a
buck
a
beer
i
dont
want
to
go
overboard
but
i
really
like
this
beer
moreover
it
seems
to
be
a
perfect
interpretation
of
its
style

this
is
a
reasonably
drinkable
black
ale
for
the
winter
months
for
the
most
part
d
not
bad
not
great
average
one
could
work
through
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
dont
drink
it
too
cold
or
youll
miss
out
on
some
subtle
notes
try
with
meatloaf
and
mashed
potatoes
full
flavor
with
a
reasonable
after
taste
thumbs
up
though
i
bought
in
a
variety
pack
i
would
purchase
a
full
case
for
one
of
the
up
comming
beer
club
events
we
have
coming
up
poured
out
a
12
ounce
bottle
very
dark
almost
black
little
or
no
head
its
a
plainer
and
less
flavor
than
the
winter
lager
flavor
is
very
disappointing
compared
to
the
color
it
is
very
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
expected
more
of
a
malt
or
coco
flavor
or
maybe
some
dark
fruity
flavors
if
you
are
looking
for
something
special
look
again
if
you
want
a
solid
drinking
every
day
brew
this
is
it
drinks
suprisingly
well
for
one
though
very
mild
allround
had
to
dig
for
character
though
was
the
first
beer
i
had
for
the
day
a
schwarz
light
lite
very
drinkable
best
to
session
with
a
few
other
saranacs
actually
as
simple
as
this
seems
id
love
to
oscillate
on
a
do
nothing
evening
with
this
and
a
nicely
contrasting
saranac
from
this
winter
pack
nice
to
see
some
new
entries
into
the
lineup
this
season
drinks
easy
but
not
that
great
a
schwartz
bier
could
drink
2
or
3
before
boredom
sets
in
drinkability
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
bitter
flavor
on
this
one
verging
on
sour
it
reminds
me
of
nuts
that
have
gone
off
d
decent
drinkability
easy
enough
to
consume
in
multiples
but
wonder
what
my
tolerance
would
be
a
decent
session
minded
beer
for
the
casual
craft
drinker
drinkability
smooth
beer
with
deep
contrast
the
beer
is
enjoyable
though
i
would
not
actively
seek
it
out
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
this
fits
it
very
nicely
well
balanced
and
drinkable
with
some
nice
lightly
roasted
characteristics
watereddown
and
lackluster
are
the
best
adjectives
to
describe
this
sampling
experience
an
american
stab
at
a
traditional
german
style
that
fails
to
capture
the
richness
of
this
unique
style
of
beer
flavlors
were
sadly
lacking
nothing
of
the
chocolate
malt
profile
was
evident
nothing
special
md
a
relatively
easy
drinker
that
is
superior
to
lighter
beers
in
the
winter
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
and
doesnt
leave
a
lot
of
taste
in
the
mouth
after
you
swallow
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
very
dark
amber
clear
with
reddishorange

nice
creamy

dissolved
into
a
thick
film
laces
really
well
slight
roasted
aroma
faintess
hint

bitterness
very
smooth
in

mouth
highly
drinkable
not
the
best
black
lager
out
there
but
pretty
good
d
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
think
their
black
forest
is
a
tad
better
tho
d
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
you
get
home
from
work
or
with
some
food
but
too
simple
to
be
a
sipper
solid
drinkability
good
flavors
that
work
well
together
a
good
example
of
the
style
which
i
am
a
fan
of
last
of
the
saranac
twelve
beers
of
winter
beers
for
me
to
try
poured
a
nice
dep
chocolate
and
ruby
tingea
large
fluffy
almond
colored
head
atop
a
mix
of
german
malt
and
spice
in
the
nosenot
strong
but
quite
nice
really
not
much
to
say
about
the
flavors
because
there
were
not
manylight
iron
and
chocolate
is
all
i
really
picked
up
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
made
it
even
less
drinkable
in
my
mind
ehit
started
out
ok
but
really
seemed
to
fizzle
out
in
the
end
t
tastes
kind
of
like
cotton
to
be
honest
not
sure
what
this
means
but
its
in
my
notes
its
very
very
dry
and
has
a
sour
malt
taste
to
it
very
tasty
beer
not
sure
id
call
it
a
schwarzbier
like
the
label
says
that
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
saranac
12
pack
variety
packs
always
provide
a
lot
of
enjoyment
and
this
years
winter
selection
is
on
target
again
quite
drinkable
not
incredibly
complex
in
other
words
a
very
nice
schwarzbier
if
someone
likes
guinness
this
may
be
a
nice
beer
to
introduce
them
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
beating
a
dead
horse
here
but
this
is
no
typical
schwarzbier
must
be
that
it
was
brewed
with
a
lager
yeast
but
beyodn
that
it
drinks
a
bit
more
like
a
porter
its
not
really
true
to
style
but
it
is
pretty
good
this
winter
pack
is
pretty
solid
so
far
cheers
drinkability
average
for
the
style
nothing
overly
exciting
but
nothing
bad
either

to
drink

in

not
get

on

the

edges

schwarzbier
used
to
own
this
no
where
near
as
traditional
as
that
offering

has
a
slight
tart

it

with
herbal
hops
and
harsh

that
sour
twang

with
a
harsh
tartness
to
the
finish
light
bodied
sturdy
carbonation
drinkability
is
solid
okay
darker
brew
bring
back
the
old
formula
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
taste
was
fine
nothing
exceptional
but
fine
bit
of
roast
little
bit
of
hops
and
a
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
not
hoppy
enough
to
be
a
schwarzbier
just
a
light
slightly
roasty
but
fairly
neutral
beer
d
while
i
havent
been
able
to
find
the
saranac
black
forest
around
here
i
cant
see
how
this
can
be
much
different
from
that
beer
overall
very
drinkable

that
has
made
me

on

2009
the
pour
was
noit
as
dark
as
i
expected
with
a
kind
of
ruby
redmahogany
tone
with
little
to
no
heaf
and
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
bit
of
hops
and
nuts
but
it
was
somewhat
muted
and
not
very
enticing
the
mouthfeel
was
not
too
bad
a
bit
on
the
high
side
of
medium
body
with
a
honey
like
smooth
texture
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
more
sour
and
bitter
than
chocolately
and
coffeelike
as
marketed
this
beer
had
some
likeable
aspects
to
it
but
it
did
not
live
up
to
its
marketing
campaign
nothing
extraordinary
here
kinda
weird
saranac
already
has
a
black
lager
called
black
forest
looks
and
tastes
mostly
the
same
to
me
but
whatever
luckily
i
love
me
some
black
lagers
so
although
this
may
be
a
clone
basically
its
still
enjoyable
i
do
like
the
black
forest
better
due
to
its
hint
of
caramel
and
more
roastiness
in
there
but
this
black
lager
is
still
solid
with
some
decent
roastiness
not
as
as
good
as
the
big
moose
ale
but
another
solid
saranac
winter
mixer
overall
a
decent
lager
not
as
good
as

to
drink

sure

some
nuttiness
and
hints
of
earthy
herbal
hops
toward
the
finish
clean
finish
light
to
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
tasty
and
drinkable
for
sure
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
from
this
variety
pack
good
stuff
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
scent
thats
also
a
bit
chocolatey
it
seems
as
though
they
added
chocolate
malt
only
to
a
traditional
lager
i
guess
it
works
the
taste
is
good
its
light
yet
full
of
flavor
there
is
a
dry
roasted
character
but
also
a
really
sweet
chocolate
flavor
in
there
as
well
its
pretty
damn
quaffable
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
better
than
average
black
lager
it
seems
as
though
the
malt
bill
is
quite
simplistic
but
who
cares
it
tastes
good
to
me
cheers
they
should
stick
to
black
forest
as
their
flagship
schwarzbier
this
beer
just
reeks
of
desperation
to
fill
up
a
holiday
pack
with
new
beers
the
winter
lager
and
even
the
maple
porter
offered
more
when
compared
to
this
overall
not
bad
but
definitely
the
weakest
in
the
winter
pack
which
is
otherwise
quite
good
this
year
if
i
were
buying
a
six
pack
i
would
opt
for
black
forest
over
this
any
day
drinkability
its
interesting
im
not
really
sure
what
to
make
of
it
its
my
first
beer
of
this
style
so
i
cant
really
say
if
its
typical
of
the
style
or
not
that
being
said
its
a
solid
beer
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
spectacular
i
dont
know
if
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
but
it
was
worth
the
try
d
this
lager
stars
bitter
and
ends
bitter
not
alot
of
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
but
a
pretty
decent
brew
none
the
less
review
is
optional
but
now
it
is
telling
me
i
have
to
write
one
well
my
husband
and
i
are
guinness
fans
and
this
reminds
me
of
that
beer
but
little
bit
lighter
very
dark
red
color
aroma
if
clean
with
hints
of
roasted
malts
flavor
is
mild
and
smooth
with
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
chocolate
isnt
overpowered
by
the
roasted
malt
like
most
dark
almost
black
beers
are
the
body
is
on
the
light
but
not
watery
and
is
oddly
refreshing
overall
an
amazing
beer
and
i
was
extremely
shocked
usually
i
tend
to
like
my
lagers
on
the
lighter
side
pilsners
helles
lagers
o
its
full
of
toastedmalt
flavor
with
a
ton
of
sweetness
and
the
oakwoodbakers
chocolate
aftertaste
is
very
nice
the
sweet
knocks
down
the
bitterness
a
bunch
which
makes
for
a
pretty
taste
easytohandle
brew
a
beer
ill
definitely
grab
again
color
is
black
initially
and
dark
reddish
brown
in
the
light
thin
layer
of
khaki
foam
that
parts
after
the
first
couple
sips
aroma
is
mild
with
a
light
amount
of
roast
taste
is
lightly
bitter
and
roasty
feels
mildly
astringent
dry
with
zero
sweetness
vague
carob
and
ash
light
dry
roast
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
overall
its
lightness
is
an
asset
when
paired
with
heavier
food
like
bbq
good
black
lager
i
enjoyed
this
beer
smooth
one
of
if
not
the
best
black
lager
i
have
had
i
like
it
decent
lager
overall
a
drinkable
beer
with
decent
flavor
but
not
outstanding
nor
exceptional
easily
one
of
my
new
favorites
for
the
price
and
availability
you
can
even
buy
it
in
drugstores
in
texas
its
brewed
locally
and
i
have
never
seen
it
outside
texas
o
a
great
beer
this
is
one
of
those
that
you
can
session
pretty
often
i
love
the
black
lagers
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
ohas
flavor
and
was
a
good
beer
a
tan
froth
quickly
folds
into
a
thin
layer
atop
this
dark
brown
brew
aroma
consists
of
caramel
malt
and
milk
chocolate
tastes
of
grain
roasted
malt
subtle
dark
chocolate
and
tea
light
bodied
and
smooth
this
is
a
flavorless
beer
with
no
oomph
moving
on
oeasy
drinking
lager
not
a
great
range
of
flavors
but
better
than
adjunct
lagers
overall
its
not
too
far
off
the
mark
for
the
style
although
not
outstanding
o
a
simple
but
tasty
schwarzbier
nice
toasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
meld
and
balance
nicely
the
taste
is
creamy
with
burnt
toast
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
front
also
with
some
faint
mineral
flavor
it
fades
rather
quickly
after
swallowing
to
some
sticky
sweetness
with
a
little
bit
of
dark
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
typical
of
a
lager
though
i
feel
it
could
have
been
a
little
bit
heavier
and
it
would
have
satisfied
me
quite
well
its
refreshing
and
something
i
could
drink
after
a
hot
summers
day
but
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
on
the
regular
though
if
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
ontap
i
would
probably
bump
my
score
up
a
little
bit
as
far
as
texas
beers
go
however
this
isnt
bad
at
all
pours
a
clear
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
tastes
better
than
it
smells
in
my
opinion
i
have
seen
this
trend
in
alot
of
texas
beers
watery
beers
that
are
probably
thirst
quenching
but
not
conforming
stylewise
this
beer
just
is
weak
way
too
watery
tasting
not
enough
malt
umph
nor
enough
noble
hop
character
hops
taste
weird
too
off
almost
catty
o
wanted
more
character
but
not
unpleasant
for
lager
the
beer
is
black
with
a
half
inch
of
beige
head
the
aroma
offers
light
roast
chocolate
lager
yeast
bread
creamy
feel
and
nice
balance
bready
chocolates
light
to
medium
bodied
with
fairly
low
carbonation
silky
smooth
and
easy
drinking
good
stuff
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
leonards
in
lubbock
overall
a
nice
drinker
but
really
lacking
the
taste
i
was
expecting
o
very
light
but
nice
roasted
and
nutty
flavors
tastes
like
a
porter
made
with
lager
yeast
complex
but
ultimately
light
bodied
perhaps
a
tad
bitter
wish
i
could
get
a
hold
of
this
one
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
got
this
sucker
from
a
beer
trade
this
is
really
easy
to
drink
especially
for
a
dark
beer
ill
have
another
some
time
though
it
wasnt
love
at
first
taste
rjt
overall
got
this
as
an
alternative
to
the
bmc
on
tap
and
it
was
clearly
better
than
those
offerings
but
again
only
got
it
because
it
was
all
i
could
and
would
only
get
again
in
the
same
situation
a
very
dark
beer
i
drank
this
from
the
bottle
so
i
couldnt
measure
the
head
the
smell
was
very
hoppy
with
a
kind
of
a
pilsner
smell
tasting
it
the
smells
changed
hoppy
turned
into
black
ale
and
pilsner
turned
into
hefeweizen
a
bit
of
a
strong
aftertaste
but
it
is
to
be
expected
from
a
dark
beer
over
all
an
enjoyable
experience
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
rhar
sons
products
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
deep
but
still
slightly
transluscent
dark
brown
with
a
biege
head
that
dissipates
slowly
theres
a
nice
finger
length
head
left
atop
the
beer
the
aroma
is
of
slightly
sweet
and
dark
malt
that
almost
smells
charred
from
the
smokiness
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
slightly
smoky
dark
malt
that
is
slightly
sweet
in
the
background
the
hop
presence
is
minimal
so
the
malt
gets
to
shine
with
this
beer
the
body
is
light
with
adequate
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
ugly
pug
has
a
lighter
body
than
average
but
it
does
manage
to
assert
itself
with
its
malty
creamy
body
it
makes
a
good
schwarzbier
session
brew
and
its
easy
going
nature
makes
it
a
good
choice
for
newbies
to
the
style
it
would
be
even
better
with
a
slightly
heavier
chewier
body
but
it
is
definitely
a
respectable
effort
in
its
own
right
and
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
glad
i
was
able
to
try
one
from
rahr
sons
wished
i
could
have
had
their
scotch
ale
the
mouthfeel
has
a
much
more
thin
and
light
consistency
than
i
would
have
desired
overall
a
decent
brew
o
good
beer
but
not
great
beer
a
feeling
that
it
is
lacking
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
however
there
is
room
for
improvement
ive
had
better
and
ive
had
worse
o
i
love
going
to
the
rahr
tour
and
having
this
on
draft
it
is
a
good
beer
and
i
love
getting
it
once
in
a
while
this
to
me
is
rahrs
most
popular
beer
this
will
probably
be
my
goto
brewery
whenever
i
find
myself
in
texas
this
beer
pours
colalike
with
a
lot
of
foam
that
doesnt
dies
down
impressive
appearance
but
thats
the
extent
of
it
not
much
on
the
nose
theres
very
little
roast
but
a
lot
of
lingering
maltiness
a
bit
of
an
unwelcome
sour
bite
cloyingly
sweet
thin
bodied
which
makes
it
drinkable
dial
up
the
viscosity
and
id
call
it
a
good
sipper
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
after
dinner
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
favorite
for
some
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
overalli
do
not
enjoy
rahr
and
son
beers
but
going
to
a
local
beer
store
that
didnt
have
anything
that
i
wanted
to
buy
i
just
bought
this
single
for
1
50
so
i
didnt
walk
out
w
nothing
however
this
is
the
best
of
all
the
rahr
and
son
brews
ive
had
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
very
underwhelming
in
most
aspects
there
was
not
as
much
full
flavor
that
you
might
expect
from
a
black
lager
the
aroma
was
very
soft
and
did
not
tease
me
into
the
drink
never
while
having
it
did
i
want
to
continue
my
drink
easily
said
it
was
very
boring
there
was
nothing
great
or
even
good
about
this
beer
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
unspectacular
but
it
was
a
nice
thirst
quencher
for
me
that
i
killed
in
about
three
minutes
wouldnt
mind
it
again
after
a
workout
ugly
pug
is
a
really
cool
brew
you
get
a
pretty
big
though
not
overwhelming
taste
of
a
dark
beer
while
still
being
able
to
enjoy
a
rather
light
body
thats
the
schwartzbier
style
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
different
schwartzbiers
but
this
is
definitely
far
from
the
worst
of
the
lot
ive
tried
the
roasted
malts
really
give
you
that
big
flavor
of
coffee
its
very
drinkable
due
to
its
lighter
body
so
get
ready
to
put
down
a
few
of
these
without
feeling
like
you
made
a
mistake
do
drinkability
is
low
besides
a
slight
coffee
finish
the
flavors
are
nearly
nonexistent
after
about
5
minutes
at
that
point
i
am
almost
drinking
watereddown
coffee
would
definitely
help
if
the
flavors
had
any
staying
power
but
even
then
they
werent
incredibly
noteworthy
to
begin
with
owell
this
is
definitely
a
good
tasting
beer
its
fairly
mild
yet
fairly
exciting
at
the
same
time
its
refreshing
to
get
this
sort
of
taste
from
the
low
abv
and
lager
format
im
impressed
with
this
attempt
at
the
style
a
little
too
light
for
a
schwarzbier
but
its
highly
drinkable
very
nice
session
beer
overall
this
beer
strikes
an
excellent
balance
between
strong
roasted
flavor
and
a
clean
finish
it
is
good
for
sessioning
and
an
upgrade
from
light
lagers
for
sunny
summer
days
definitely
not
boring
the
smoky
bitterness
adds
a
nice
pop
as
well
as
the
roasted
malts
this
would
pair
nicely
with
a
grilled
steak
nothing
too
extreme
here
but
better
than
i
expected
solid
b
o
a
tad
thin
for
me
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
picked
this
up
from
central
market
in
fort
worth
while
we
were
staying
with
a
friend
pours
a
jetblack
with
no
head
the
nose
had
slight
toasted
and
sour
malt
characteristics
flavors
were
dark
roasted
with
a
sour
malt
backbone
the
beer
has
a
good
balance
with
a
smokeysweet
aftertaste
the
beer
has
a
mostly
crisp
finish
with
a
slight
linger
to
the
smokey
characteristics
tasty
dark
brown
opaque
body
no
visible
carbonation
under
one
finger
tan
head
minimal
lacing
and
quick
dissipation
theres
some
mild
roast
and
floral
hops
in
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
taste
mirrors
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
not
a
lot
of
effervescence
extremely
drinkable
not
heavy
at
all
while
this
doesnt
rise
to
the
level
of
moonlights
death
by
taxes
what
does
this
is
a
fine
schwarzbier
and
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
the
beer
is
almost
black
with
cranberry
colored
hues
and
a
foamy
sandy
head
that
stuck
around
it
smells
of
toasted
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
smoke
tastes
like
a
campfire
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
coffee
and
roasted
malt
the
beer
feels
light
with
a
lot
of
soft
carbonation
and
a
dry
smokey
finish
the
ugly
pug
really
impressed
me
i
have
passed
it
up
many
times
at
the
store
and
now
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
for
free
i
may
have
to
get
me
a
6pack
now
the
reason
i
like
ugly
pug
is
because
of
its
heavier
flavors
while
remaining
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
dont
find
it
to
be
a
watery
beer
either
i
definitely
recommend
drinking
it
after
it
has
warmed
a
bit
light
in
body
extremely
smooth
and
pretty
refreshing
drinkability
is
good
certainly
something
id
have
in
the
summer
or
spring
good
beer
ill
take
this
over
most
lagers
any
day
d
overall
this
beer
was
a
disappointment
i
tried
three
bottles
of
the
six
pack
so
far
and
they
all
turned
out
the
same
way
i
was
hoping
just
one
or
two
bottles
were
duds
or
something
this
beer
tastes
and
feels
like
its
been
sitting
in
an
open
glass
in
the
fridge
for
the
last
few
days
d
not
a
bad
schwarzbier
i
would
have
preferred
some
more
intense
flavors
and
aromas
but
its
good
this
is
a
nice
black
lager
i
have
never
heard
of
the
brewery
until
jenray
hooked
me
up
with
two
of
their
beers
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
their
other
stuff
thanks
jenray
drinkability
is
better
than
i
expected
when
i
added
up
the
scorecard
im
happy
with
this
brew
d
the
light
body
of
the
beer
and
the
great
flavors
make
this
a
very
very
good
session
beer
especially
in
these
winter
months
easygoing
session
beer
to
the
max
12
oz

kjkinsey

aromas
of
toasted
malt
black
coffee
metallicmineral
nice
dark
coffee
flavors
dark

a
little
bit
nutty
and
sweet
like
roasted
pecans
and
some
tealike
puckering
tannins
in
there
as
well
like
the
smell
theres
a
mineral
quality
in
the
taste
moderate
carbonation
with
larger
bubbles
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
as
with
many
lagers
clean
finish
somewhat
watery
flavors
are
good
but
dont
linger
very
long
highly
drinkable
ive
become
a
fan
of
this
style
lately
and
so
its
always
good
to
try
another
interpretation
when
possible
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
other
than
the
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
malt
i
dont
get
much
else
other
than
a
little
bit
of
cream
the
beer
has
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
the
beer
being
a
little
bit
watery
medium
carbonation
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
beers
from
rahrs
overall
this
was
not
indicative
of
a
true
german
schwartz
beer
however
it
is
very
drinkable
but
not
to
style
i
was
intrigued
by
the
top
beers
in
zymurgy
mag
but
it
looks
like
this
was
a
ballot
stuffer
i
must
say
a
good
surprise
of
dark
dark
lager
with
a
nice
head
smell
is
just
mild
chocolate
palate
is
that
of
schwarzbier
but
quite
thin
as
expected
but
didnt
allow
for
much
latitude
the
beer
tasted
earthy
and
chocolaty
mild
bitter
and
washes
thin
not
much
else
no
fruit
and
not
particularly
overly
sweet
which
was
a
plus
very
drinkable
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
not
a
bad
crossover
beer
for
those
on
the
fence
about
craft
beer
as
it
has
the
light
lager
taste
the
mouth
could
be
a
bit
heftier
but
it
does
make
it
easy
to
session
give
me
more
black
lagers
a
decent
schwarbier
quite
well
rounded
nothing
really
stood
out
but
everything
complimented
each
other
i
would
drink
this
again
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
great
job
this
is
very
close
to
being
a
porter
if
it
was
a
tad
darker
id
say
it
was
if
you
can
find
it
on
tap
its
excellent
the
bottle
falls
a
bit
short
of
this
score
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
its
still
good
this
beer
seems
to
follow
what
is
becoming
a
texas
tradition
of
light
bodied
maltiness
with
a
light
hop
presence
in
beers
going
by
the
styles
of
st
arnolds
real
ale
and
spoetzl
mouthfeeldrinkability
felt
like
a
meal
while
drinking
the
combination
of
a
dark
beer
and
the
bite
it
had
didnt
feel
right
to
me
pours
a
nice
black
color
very
nice

very
nice

the
taste
is
slightly
sweet

with

and

medium

drinkable
a
tasty
little
brew
d
good
drinkability
lucky
to
live
in
dfw
i
can
find
the
rahr
beers
in
many
places
ive
had
ugly
gug
on
tap
in
several
restaurants
and
it
always
impresses
d
easy
drinking
in
most
every
respect
save
the
fairly
unusual
flavor
d
i
only
got
about
a
third
of
the
way
through
this
one
before
it
went
down
the
drain
im
assuming
it
was
a
bad
batch
and
if
i
ever
get
to
try
it
again
ill
update
the
review
d
decent
beer
ive
better
of
the
style
but
its
tasty
and
goes
down
easily
and
given
the
abv
easily
one
to
sit
with
for
a
while
drinkability
not
really
enjoying
the
twangy
aspect
and
the
ashen
flavors
are
also
a
detriment
i
like
the
brown
bread
elements
but
the
beer
just
doesnt
come
together
very
well
drinkablity
easy
to
drink
with
a
very
pleasant
aroma
and
flavor
character
great
session
beer
i
would
recommend
this
one
for
you
malt
heads
it
could
use
a
bit
more
heft
in
the
body
but
overall
a
tasty
brew
drinkability
this
style
is
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
i
cant
say
that
i
would
go
and
search
one
of
these
out
but
for
the
few
i
had
i
enjoyed
it
the
better
of
the
rahr
brewery
beers
ive
had
not
as
black
as
a
lot
of
these
beers
tend
to
be
deep
brown
chocolaty
color
smells
sweet
and
like
roasted
malts
a
good
amount
of
dark
malt
character
in
it
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
balancing
it
out
a
little
one
of
the
better
interpretations
of
this
style
ive
had
md
a
little
on
the
thin
side
good
carbonation
and
well
balanced
flavors
make
it
very
drinkable
easy
enough
to
quaff
but
just
not
as
satisfying
a
flavor
as
i
would
like
sam
adamsblack
lager
seems
to
have
the
six
pack
a
day
schwarz
down
pat
but
hey
i
drank
two
as
a
capper
it
cant
be
too
bad
d
this
was
a
pretty
aboveaverage
beer
definitely
my
best
choice
on
tap
and
probably
the
best
beer
i
had
in
dallas
however
my
experience
was
limited
to
shiner
negro
modelo
and
sam
adams
it
paired
well
with
my
sirloin
steak
but
i
was
longing
for
a
bit
more
flavor
worth
a
try
dark
black
and
opaque
kind
of
purplish
head
foams
up
to
a
finger
width
and
then
is
gone
smell
is
caramel
and
malty
little
smell
of
hops
taste
is
a
bit
spicy
and
slightly
peppery
very
subtle
there
is
a
maltiness
that
is
all
around
and
then
comes
in
a
touch
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
at
the
end
mouthfeel
has
some
body
to
it
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
drinkablity
is
pretty
high
clean
and
dry
with
some
bumps
and
bruises
in
between
but
thats
better
than
sliding
down
so
easily
you
didnt
even
know
it
was
there
i
was
hoping
for
a
better
brew
here
a
little
disapointing
though
verdict
a
nice
enough
beer
but
not
my
favorite
texan
black
lager
that
award
goes
to
shiner
97
everything
here
is
tasty
enough
but
theres
just
not
enough
of
it
if
you
catch
my
drift
if
this
was
just
a
little
more
intense
and
full
it
could
be
a
winner
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
sit
on
the
porch
with
and
watch
the
cars
go
by
things
go
a
bit
downhill
in
the
taste
department
as
a
blandish
roasted
malt
presence
tries
its
hardest
to
suggest
powdered
cocoa
but
really
only
attains
a
slight
caramel
biscuit
note
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
either
and
the
overzealous
carbonation
level
and
dry
finish
kill
off
much
of
the
crispness
and
refreshing
qualities
for
which
the
style
is
known
still
ugly
pug
is
a
nice
interpretation
of
a
schwarzbier
from
rahr
sons
and
one
i
could
see
myself
having
again
pours
a
dark
brown
black
color
body
with
a
tannish
creamy
looking
head
okay
sized
and
somewhat
lasting
dark
roasty
malty
aroma
some
coffee
a
little
skunkiness
some
fruitiness
too
enticing
creamy
mouthfeel
light
fruitiness
like
a
hefe
some
banana
not
as
stouty
as
i
was
expecting
very
tasty
kind
of
bland
decent
but
nothing
i
would
recommend
with
enthusiasm
its
light
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
d
easy
to
drink
with
a
very
pleasant
aroma
and
flavor
character
taste
is
smooth
malty
tasty
chocolate
malt
very
mellow
and
understated
excellent
drinking
but
not
too
complex
just
something
tasty
you
can
drink
again
and
again
nuttinwrong
with
that
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
kinda
like
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
schwarzbier
and
i
cant
find
anything
to
complain
about
with
it
but
i
would
love
to
try
the
exact
same
recipe
with
a
slightly
higher
malt
bill
a
very
average
schwarzbier
but
not
bad
d
not
bad
i
could
not
drink
more
than
a
few
d
good
schwarzbier
flavorful
one
that
id
be
glad
to
drink
again
overall
a
very
very
solid
beer
here
with
a
fantastic
flavor
really
snck
up
on
me
as
i
really
did
not
think
it
would
be
this
good
but
this
one
is
defintly
a
keeper
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
nice
size
off
white
head
dissipates
quickly
aroma
of
smoky
nutty
roasty
malts
not
much
hop
to
be
found
in
the
nose
tastes
like
it
smells
roasted
malt
bitterness
in
the
finish
bubbly
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
to
thin
in
the
body
i
thought
the
carbonation
seemed
a
bit
to
high
and
lessened
my
enjoyment
of
this
brew
overall
a
decent
brew
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
overall
nice
beer
a
little
boring
but
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
2
inch
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
aroma
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
a
pilsner
or
a
dunkel
the
nose
is
slightly
grainy
a
hint
of
sulfur
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
follows
suit
without
the
sulfur
it
has
roasted
malts
sweet
candy
sugar
and
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
its
really
goes
together
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
slightly
under
carbonated
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
good
stuff
cheers
all
in
all
a
good
refreshing
brew
id
like
to
try
again
to
check
on
the
soap
taste
though
overall
an
ok
schwarzbier
but
not
the
best
a
decent
beer
drinkability
schwarzes
are
all
or
nothing
for
me
i
like
a
good
roasty
taste
but
a
little
of
something
off
and
im
not
onboard
such
is
the
case
with
this
one
the
tart
bit
kind
of
messes
up
the
good
roasty
flavor
though
the
second
one
of
my
stash
went
down
fine
at
a
street
party
this
weekend
preceded
by
a
handful
of
eliot
ness
and
otr
so
the
tart
bit
was
less
of
a
factor
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
mahogany
tones
when
held
up
to
the
light
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
there
is
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
of
toasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
cocoa
in
there
as
well
the
initial
taste
was
a
little
bizarre
very
biting
and
almost
minty
there
is
also
the
sweet
roasted
malt
backbone
but
its
masked
by
the
opening
astringency
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
decent
carbonation
the
astringency
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
a
little
bit
and
this
is
below
average
as
far
as
scharzbiers
go
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
potential
but
it
lacks
fullness
on
the
palate
and
needs
a
little
tweaking
howver
i
could
still
have
a
couple
of
these
the
mouthfeel
is
a
total
buzzkill
drinkability
is
nice
but
it
suffers
from
the
feeling
that
the
beer
is
a
little
light
not
bad
at
all
just
no
something
special
when
it
comes
to
what
are
probably
the
two
most
wellknown
beers
of
this
style
in
texas
ill
have
to
give
the
slight
edge
to
ugly
pug
black
lager
over
shiner
black
lager
both
need
a
big
shot
of
personality
bottom
line
this
little
pug
aint
ugly
but
he
aint
no
beauty
king
of
a
schwarzbier
either
not
outstanding
but
definitely
has
potential
to
be
a
nice
little
session
brew
this
is
a
good
little
black
lager
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
d
very
good
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
schwarzbier
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
will
buy
it
again
overall
impression
nice
and
drinkable
nothing
overly
exciting
but
a
solid
beer
there
is
a
smokey
taste
with
a
hint
of
licorice
the
flavor
goes
away
fast
theres
not
much
of
an
after
taste
to
it
theres
really
nothing
to
it
which
imo
is
the
wrong
way
to
make
a
black
lager
cheers
d
a
little
too
much
of
a
onenote
beer
its
not
bad
but
all
there
is
is
roasted
malt
deasy
to
drink
light
and
smooth
but
still
has
character
not
really
my
style
but
pretty
impressive
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
good
representation
of
style
i
could
stick
with
this
beer
for
a
while
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
you
want
something
on
the
dark
side
but
something
that
isnt
very
heavy
drinkability
flavorful
and
balanced
very
drinkable
very
nice
take
on
the
style
the
best
of
rahr
that
ive
had
yet
easy
drinking
definitely
a
keeper
overall
a
nice
black
lager
almost
porter
like
in
taste
a
smoked
porter
but
not
mouthfeel
thanks
crwills
for
the
trade
this
is
hard
to
describe
but
overall
the
flavors
fail
to
stand
up
i
one
homebrewed
a
low
alcohol
beer
that
used
very
few
fermentable
that
beer
was
liquid
with
little
flavor
this
rahr
beer
is
similar
in
that
it
lacks
the
intensity
one
would
expect
honestly
though
i
find
all
schwarzbiers
to
share
this
attribute
so
i
guess
this
is
typical
for
the
style
refreshing
brew
i
disliked
it
at
first
then
it
grew
on
me
tastes
like
a
watered
down
porterbelgium
ale
mix
maybe
my
favorite
swartzbier
kudos
to
travis
for
getting
this
out
to
me
and
giving
me
the
chance
to
savor
a
nice
easy
drinking
black
beer
from
texas

easy

i
enjoyed
my
6pack

yes
but
not
real
memorable
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in

standard

dark
brown
almost
black
with
garnett

aroma
is
roasted

taste
is
chocolate
coffee
finish
is
roastiness
and
bitterness
medium
to
light
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
this
is
a
good
one
a
good
session
beer
and
not
as
sweet
as
some
schwarzbiers
this
is
a
regular
in
my
fridge
thanks
to
quaffer
for
the
bottle
via
trade
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
over
the
clear
ruby
brown
brew
head
fades
to
14
and
holds
steady
with
lots
of
sticky
coating
lacing
aroma
is
hearty
dark
grains
some
burntness
in
there
but
a
tart
fruitiness
in
the
middle
im
not
wild
about
taste
is
not
as
intense
with
the
dark
malts
as
the
nose
but
the
fruit
i
was
scared
of
isnt
here
either
which
is
nice
closes
with
a
light
bitterness
that
seems
more
coffee
than
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
soft
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
not
a
bad
schwarzbier
one
no
more
this
is
an
average
beer
but
it
can
still
be
enjoyed
though
a
black
lager
color
is
more
deep
brown
pours
nice
with
nice
head
head
dies
down
quickly
though
and
carbonation
is
light
smell
is
of
coffee
and
toffee
mouthful
is
light
malty
taste
with
those
same
roasted
qualities
of
coffee
and
herbs
but
not
real
strong
though
and
body
is
light
easy
drinking
but
only
partially
satisfying
i
might
chalk
this
up
to
it
being
from
a
possibly
nottoofresh
keg
or
perhaps
this
is
just
one
of
those
beers
i
like
better
from
the
bottle
a
pretty
good
interpretation
of
the
style
pours
out
to
a
lighter
brown
color
sorry
not
black
with
a
light
head
of
off
white
foam
that
about
12
inch
no
lace
medium
carbonation
with
bubbles
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aromas
are
welcoming
yeasty
malty
notes
swell
in
the
nose
with
hints
of
grain
and
bread
dough
in
the
wings
nice
taste
is
fair
toasty
malts
and
dry
grains
a
touch
of
mild
hop
essesnce
some
grassy
elements
very
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
was
decent
a
fair
beer
overall
worth
a
try
special
thanks
goes
out
to
assurbanipaul
for
the
sample
pours
a
plummish
brown
with
little
head
a
color
ive
rarely
seen
in
my
glass
i
should
note
this
is
my
first
beer
that
ive
had
of
the
style
glad
its
from
texas
yall
smell
is
grainysmoky
the
grain
is
something
ive
noticed
with
the
other
rahr
ive
had
taste
is
chocolate
but
very
watered
down
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
considering
this
is
a
lager
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
more
complexity
rather
than
chocolate
and
grains
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
it
isnt
an
insult
to
call
it
middle
of
the
road
not
too
heavy
or
thin
the
drinkability
is
high
and
i
would
love
to
pair
this
with
a
burrito
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
taste
could
use
just
a
bit
more
body
i
really
liked
the
ugly
pug
pat
him
on
the
head
if
you
see
him
or
better
yet
take
him
home
for
a
couple
of

the
crisp
mouthfeel
of
lager
with
the
rich
malt
character
of
an
ale
the
dominant
flavor
is
of
roasted
coffee
beans
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
combine
to
give
a
pleasant
medium
finish
mediumtodark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
head
is
small
and
fleeting
the
odor
is
quite
light
lightly
roasted
aromas
are
shortlived
giving
way
to
something
approaching
skunk
flavors
are
of
roast
and
coffee
with
that
light
crisp
lager
feel
that
gives
this
away
as
a
lager
the
mouthfeel
understandably
leans
away
from
being
full
and
chewy
but
in
the
process
i
think
its
a
little
too
thin
i
know
my
scores
are
pretty
low
but
this
really
isnt
a
horrible
offensive
beer
it
just
doesnt
do
much
of
anything
for
me

damn
nice
black
lager
slightly
chilled
pours
black
tinged
with
red
covered
in
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
clean
lager
with
a
malt
roasty
character
and
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
taste
is
mild
delight
smooth
roast
and
creamy
malt
slight
chocolate
after
taste
that
mixs
well
with
the
delicate
hop
bite
nice
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
texas
is
lucky
to
have
this
beer
and
i
would
not
mind
calling
it
my
own
opinion
this
beer
is
not
a
schwarzbier
i
dont
really
know
what
to
call
it
so
on
its
own
merit
it
is
quite
out
of
balance
for
just
about
everything
the
hops
were
very
reserved
to
showcase
the
malt
but
there
was
too
much
chocolate
andor
carafa
malt
to
give
the
beer
the
edge
there
was
a
lot
of
toastiness
going
on
here
but
too
much
for
the
base
malts
this
was
probably
my
least
favorite
of
rahrs
beers
very
drinkable
certainly
a
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
in
one
sitting
overall
impression
highly
sessionable
kind
of
1
dimensional
would
benefit
from
some
increased
malt
complexity
but
overall
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
recommended
this
beer
was
hard
to
make
out
but
very
easy
to
drink
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
not
for
me
but
not
a
bad
beer
on
the
whole
the
label
alone
is
worth
buying
a
sixer
the
picture
is
great
and
there
is
a
little
story
on
the
bottle
about
the
name
of
the
beer
if
you
are
interested
in
that
sort
of
thing
it
is
worth
a
try
deep

colornowhere
near
the
darkness
id
expect
from
a
schwarzbier
but
a
nice
color
none
the
less
good

very
nice
roasted
flavor
somewhat

the
whole
package
together
overall
a
very

well
worth
a

thank
you
12
ounce
bottle
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
an
averagesized
light
brown
head
retention
is
okay
the
aroma
is
a
sweet
smelling
combination
of
chocolate
malts
and
roastiness
the
taste
has
a
strong
element
of
roasted
flavors
upfront
with
hints
of
chocolate
popping
through
towards
the
middle
through
the
finish
the
necessary
sweetness
rides
in
alongside
the
chocolate
flavors
and
keeps
the
roastiness
from
going
overboard
personally
i
find
the
roastiness
to
be
too
strong
for
a
schwarzbier
with
levels
almost
reaching
a
weak
dry
stout
still
this
is
a
good
beer
and
easily
the
most
interesting
choice
from
the
three
standard
rahr
beers
hands
down
the
best
texas
brewed
schwarzbier
ive
ever
tasted
note
about
head
problems
i
have
had
this
from
a
keg
and
experienced
none
of
the
above
troubles
with
the
head
from
everything
i
hear
my
particular
six
looks
to
be
the
anomaly
rich
full
creamy
mouthfeel
very
different
from
the
other
two
or
three
schwarzbiers
i
have
tried
this
one
is
a
little
more
robust
good
drinkability
left
me
wanting
another
bottle
this
is
a
very
drinkable
schwarzbier
i
enjoyed
every
sip
if
this
were
a
local
i
would
quaff
it
often
it
is
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
what
more
do
you
want
in
a
beer
nothing
give
me
a
sixpack
and
a
glass
and
i
am
sound
as
a
pound
thanks
assurbanipaul
tasty
beer
great
label
thanks
try
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definately
have
another
a
lot
of
maltoaty
taste
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
like
a
porter
or
oatmeal
stout
but
not
as
heavy
light
bitter
finish
with
a
pleasnt
aftertaste
pours
out
a
rubytinted
brown
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
aroma
is
lightly
roasted
taste
is
a
mix
of
roasted
coffeeish
graininess
and
pleasant
bitterness
finishes
dry
and
quite
clean
moderate
body
and
medium
carbonation
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
more
on
draught
but
never
tooks
notes
in
the
bottle
its
a
fairly
ordinary
dark
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
mahogany
color
with
a
short
tan
head
that
fades
into
a
creamy
lace
nose
is
dominated
by
roasted
coffee
beans
with
some
fainter
notes
of
dark
cherries
in
the
background
taste
begins
with
roasted
malts
and
fresh
espresso
followed
by
notes
of
bitter
burnt
coffee
and
spicy
hops
the
bitterness
remains
in
a
lingering
aftertaste
a
pretty
interesting
beer
and
another
winner
from
the
boys
in
fort
worth
recommended
overall
this
beer
showed
no
off
aromas
or
tastes
i
will
try
this
again
and
probably
edit
this
review
when
drinking
it
at
the
brewery
it
was
my
favorite
from
rahr
at
the
flying
saucer
tonight
it
left
me
a
little
less
enthusiastic
i
guess
this
means
i
will
be
forced
to
go
drink
it
free
at
rahr
brewery
on
saturday
mouthfeel
is
light
slightly
acidic
and
biting
leaves
just
a
touch
of
stickiness
on
the
lips
and
tongue
easy
to
drink
very
true
to
style
