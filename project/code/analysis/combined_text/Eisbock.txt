o
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
it
did
have
some
overt
booze
to
it
but
nothing
egregious
and
allaround
enjoyable
o
aside
from
being
a
little
over
carbonated
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
and
definitely
a
great
first
impression
to
the
brewery
loved
the
flavor
d
while
i
dont
have
a
whole
lot
of
eisbock
experience
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
nice
representation
of
the
style
overall
its
great
to
see
this
little
brewery
tackling
a
more
obscure
style
that
you
dont
see
very
often
d
excellent
beer
hats
off
to
you
roger
excellent
would
love
to
challenge
you
with
getting
the
alcohol
notes
out
of
there
but
difficult
with
a
12
abv
NA
NA
malty
and
spicy
doppelbock
character
up
front
but
then
the
beer
is
surrounded
huge
raspberry
candy
flavor
and
sweetness
really
well
balanced
one
of
the
better
mikkeller
beers
ive
had
poured
from
a
375ml
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
i
am
one
of
the
few
apparently
who
was
floored
by
the
fresler
tripplebock
not
sure
if
thats
the
exact
base
of
this
one
but
my
inclination
is
yes
i
get
a
little
less
of
that
honey
soy
glaze
thing
that
stood
out
to
me
so
much
in
fresler
its
been
replaced
by
the
intensity
and
authenticity
of
the
berry
which
is
not
at
all
subtle
here
murky
ruby
red
brown
color
short
head
but
its
hangs
out
there
is
some
real
density
to
this
yeast
in
the
nose
is
a
mikkeller
classic
belgian
a
little
but
this
is
a
bock
beer
after
all
and
thats
there
too
the
berries
are
tart
in
the
nose
while
the
grain
is
sweet
nothing
candy
or
fake
about
the
fruit
at
all
its
just
the
essence
of
the
berry
and
its
lovely
in
the
nose
the
grain
is
deep
and
rich
and
layered
and
a
lot
more
than
the
usual
suspects
it
has
a
hefty
mellowness
to
it
if
mellowness
can
be
described
that
way
with
the
mouthfeel
of
a
port
wine
plus
a
little
prickle
of
carbonation
its
just
soft
and
rich
and
patient
but
also
huge
the
berry
lasts
longer
than
the
malt
in
the
finish
thank
a
slow
cool
fermentation
for
that
i
suspect
almost
tart
there
on
the
back
end
tannic
a
little
too
this
has
a
wine
character
in
that
way
just
as
dynamic
as
can
be
on
its
own
but
if
you
want
a
special
treat
have
it
with
a
little
dark
chocolate
and
let
the
flavors
really
come
out
better
as
it
warms
too
worth
the
money
but
i
always
say
that
with
mikkeller
stuff
full
bodied
but
trailing
with
a
maltydry
texture
the
toasted
char
fruity
tang
alcohol
spice
and
grainderived
astringency
all
aid
the
beer
in
its
dry
drinkability
but
part
of
the
bock
beers
charm
is
its
complex
and
savory
sweetness
that
is
largely
scrubbed
out
with
all
those
balancing
nuances
complex
or
complicated
as
an
eisbock
this
is
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
however
as
an
enjoyable
beer
this
doesnt
quite
cut
it
certainly
worth
trying
since
there
are
so
few
pure
eisbocks
around
expect
an
experience
just
not
necessarily
a
great
one
beer
is
thick
like
syrup
dry
on
the
finish
very
dry
malty
and
slightly
oxidized
a
little
plums
and
stone
fruits
with
some
raisins
and
figs
interesting
very
nice
beers
but
the
older
one
is
probably
over
the
hill
at
this
point
overall
this
was
quite
a
treat
and
especially
cool
to
try
not
one
but
two
vintages
of
this
rare
delicacy
this
is
a
good
brew
that
im
delighted
to
have
had
once
everything
about
this
beer
screams
extreme
from
the
nose
to
the
heavy
taste
o
i
was
expecting
this
to
just
be
disgustingly
boozy
but
it
was
actually
nicely
hidden
especially
for
18
a
nice
beer
to
try
but
not
amazing
o
well
for
something
this
high
in
alcohol
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
there
is
not
tons
of
flavor
on
it
a
nice
sipper
that
you
can
relax
with
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
of
scotch
i
could
have
this
at
night
instead
d
the
alcohol
is
impressively
disguised
and
7oz
is
actually
a
fairly
appropriate
serving
size
i
think
id
be
done
if
i
tried
to
tackle
a
12oz
or
larger
on
my
own
drinks
more
like
a
spirit
than
beer
but
quite
enjoyable
as
a
nightcap
id
really
like
to
try
this
again
with
more
age
on
it
as
i
can
imagine
it
being
quite
special
at
the
45
year
mark
o
i
liked
this
one
similar
to
a
mead
which
i
love
the
sweetness
and
booze
make
this
a
sipper
not
to
mention
it
would
put
you
on
the
floor
at
18
recommend
cheers
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
fruity
and
is
more
toward
sugar
overkill
its
balanced
out
by
a
good
dose
of
booze
but
im
not
sure
these
are
really
the
two
things
id
like
to
have
balancing
one
another
out
medium
body
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
sugar
and
alcohol
just
end
up
making
up
too
much
of
this
beer
and
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
though
i
did
quite
enjoy
the
nose
drinkability
pretty
high
despite
the
abv
recommended
donly
not
a
5
due
to
the
18
this
one
will
kick
you
in
the
ass
for
sure
if
one
does
not
respect
it
absolutely
unreal
smoothness
this
one
is
all
caramel
and
alcohol
a
liquefied
adult
version
of
a
werthers
original
d
good
i
loved
this
one
nice
brew
one
i
am
honored
to
get
the
chance
at
drinking
thanks
very
much
to
thirstybird
for
sharing
this
i
know
he
had
to
wait
in
the
cold
for
a
while
to
score
this
bottle
6570
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
translucent
copper
no
head
just
some
bubbles
nose
is
very
subtle
malty
some
caramel
and
a
hops
character
reminiscent
of
a
german
pils
taste
consistent
with
nose
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
slightly
viscous
with
a
little
heat
upfront
that
gradually
dissipates
at
the
back
i
am
pretty
shocked
that
this
is
an
18
beer
good
thing
it
comes
in
small
bottles
because
it
is
deceivingly
light
and
easy
to
quaff
overall
ummm
hello
alcohol
are
you
there
this
drinks
like
a
nonalcoholic
beverage
and
thats
what
makes
this
beer
crazy
even
half
a
pour
and
im
buzzed
so
its
definitely
there
you
just
wont
notice
it
until
the
end
unfortunately
for
me
the
beer
has
some
faults
in
the
way
of
harsh
bitterness
and
graininess
that
needs
to
be
mellowed
out
more
for
everyone
holding
onto
those
icebocks
they
definitely
be
aged
to
get
more
complexity
out
of
them
this
was
a
rare
treat
it
drinks
somewhere
between
a
spirit
and
a
beer
it
doesnt
hide
its
alcohol
but
i
found
it
complex
and
very
enjoyable
this
was
in
my
top
five
beers
to
try
list
forever
until
mike
shared
his
wealth
have
not
had
many
beers
of
this
strength
but
this
one
took
me
for
quite
a
journey
like
nothing
i
had
before
wish
this
was
not
as
rare
and
i
could
revisit
and
experiment
with
aging
this
for
different
periods
of
time
this
is
187
milliliters
of
complexity
there
is
a
reason
why
this
won
gold
at
gabf
in
2000
feel
honored
to
trying
something
that
says
not
for
distribution
or
sale
on
the
side
of
the
label
would
love
to
drink
again
and
especially
an
older
vintage
highly
recommended

and
tasted
on

as
pictured
noncommercial
label
vintage
2006
bottle
60
of
100
initially
a
bit
sparse
and
husky
and
fairly
underwhelming
until
the
midpalate
after
that
creamy
buttery
caramel
and
fruit
filled
malt
roam
about
combined
with
a
rich
and
luscious
huge
and
succulant
body
especially
after
the
midpalate
overall
it
could
be
a
bit
more
concentrated
and
richer
up
front
the
finish
could
be
longer
and
it
could
be
a
little
sweeter
as
well
overall
this
is
not
as
good
as
other
extreme
eisbocks
i
have
had
particularly
broken
keg
eisbock
from
the
old
pp
carlsbad
brewer
drinkability
abv
is
present
but
not
the
18
as
advertised
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
small
off

head
that
left
nice

thanks

for
bringing
this
in
bottle
35
poured
copper
with
no

aroma
1st

got
a
sour

than
the

fruity
like

maybe
pears
honey
vanilla
and
malts
flavor
peaches
honey
caramel
hints
of
malts
and
the
alcohol
came
out
just
right
and
for
being
18
was
not
to
strong
at
all
and
a
nice
dryness
a
big
apology
for
my
first
review
that
referenced
a
joke
as
i
saw
it
that
was
in
fact
a
very
bad
judgement
call
on
my
part
im
sorry
everyone
and
very
thankful
for
my
chance
to
try
this
magnificent
brew
phil
is
brewing
wonderful
beers
and
i
am
very
impressed
each
time
i
make
it
out
to
the
village
of
southampton
NA
all
that
said
though
upon
retasting
this
was
my
5
beer
of
the
whole
festival
o
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
not
sure
if
this
is
a
case
where
the
beer
wasnt
very
good
or
it
just
didnt
age
well
either
way
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
theres
a
bit
of
crispness
on
the
tongue
while
this
beer
maintains
a
medium
body
it
has
a
certain
thickness
that
makes
it
seems
like
it
ought
to
be
fuller
its
smooth
for
the
duration
but
has
an
interesting
mineral
quality
on
the
palate
its
a
little
cloying
in
the
thickness
atmosphere
is
okay
bubbly
head
no
real
lacing
nose
is
wood
caramel
and
booze
tastes
like
it
smells
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
eisbock
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
little
head
nice
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
is
fruity
sweet
as
well
as
sour
the
taste
is
sourish
and
has
a
sharp
alcohol
flavor
had
flower
like
flavors
not
from
hops
but
from
flowers
hard
to
drink
flavors
didnt
mix
well
overall
not
enjoyable
actually
it
was
rather
disgusting
m
chewy
dense
good
eisbock
still
very
hot
from
etoh
after
20
months
in
the
bottle
this
is
what
i
call
cheese
beer
meaning
that
it
would
go
well
with
a
cheese
tray
with
say
havarti
or
swiss
and
perhaps
deli
meats
like
ham
pastrami
or
turkey
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
all
of
red
hooks
products
and
i
have
yet
to
find
even
one
that
i
dont
like
this
has
a
very
complex
flavor
which
is
hard
to
describe
for
me
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
there
is
a
wonderful
sort
of
aftertaste
which
reminds
me
of
nuts
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
chilled
but
for
cold
weather
drinking
by
a
fire
with
a
snack
tray
while
watching
tv
or
a
movie

i
almost
gave
this
one
straight
5s
but
it
is
not
what
i
would
drink
normally
so
i
was
conservative
in
my
rating
cheers
over
all
a
great
beer
i
bought
two
bottles
when
this
hit
the
shelf
at
my
grocer
drank
the
first
right
away
and
it
was
incredibly
boozy
and
2
dimensional
the
timing
popping
this
one
open
was
perfect
it
aged
very
well
tip
my
hat
to
redhook
too
bad
its
gone
forever
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
much
like
maple
syrup
in
terms
of
viscosity
and
the
coating
viscous
nature
of
its
texture
which
would
have
been
a
nonissue
were
there
actually
any
carbonation
left
in
the
bottle
the
heavy
chewy
body
is
just
fine
but
the
clingyness
of
it
is
let
us
say
somewhat
less
appreciated
a
says
this
is
like
a
high
class
40
but
shes
only
had
hurricane
so
its
possible
she
doesnt
really
know
what
shes
talking
about
a
well
balanced
barleywine
with
a
nutty
fruit
aroma
taste
follows
the
nose
very
closely
however
the
booze
provides
a
nice
warmth
at
the
back
along
with
some
mild
bitterness
its
a
heavy
hitter
in
terms
of
abv
but
its
not
heavy
if
you
are
just
sippping
it
i
had
modest
expectations
for
semi
craft
beer
but
this
was
a
winner
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
anything
really
special
just
not
a
must
have
beer
bought
this
for
3
99
am
pleasantly
suprised
bought
a
bottle
of
the
widmer
brothers
galaxy
hopped
barley
wine
for
9
99
will
probably
rate
it
higher
but
will
still
be
happy
life
is
good
overall
not
bad
more
like
a
wheatwine
than
eisbock
but
decent
overall
nice
malts
some
hops
come
through
on
the
finish
that
give
the
wheatwine
taste
more
than
eisbock
booze
isnt
too
bad
either
i
finished
a
bomber
in
the
time
it
took
me
to
write
this
review
delicious
i
try
to
avoid
reading
other
reviews
of
beer
until
i
have
reviewed
one
after
reading
some
other
reviews
it
finally
dawned
on
me
that
this
beer
is
over
a
year
old
it
makes
a
little
more
sense
that
this
beer
has
turned
into
a
barleywine
now
wonder
what
it
tasted
like
fresh
i
found
this
bottle
at
a
store
i
dont
normally
frequent
and
since
i
never
tried
it
when
it
came
out
i
pulled
the
trigger
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
copper
color
with
a
decent
foamy
beige
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
and
leaves
decent
lace
i
can
smell
the
sugary
sweet
fruit
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
top
closer
to
my
nose
with
the
glass
brings
out
some
dark
fruits
like
plums
and
cherries
some
dark
sugar
and
caramels
and
a
surprising
amount
of
ethanol
for
a
beer
thats
over
a
year
old
this
smells
like
a
barleywine
quite
honestly
taste
is
sweet
and
fruity
up
front
i
get
some
sugars
but
not
what
i
expected
from
the
aroma
slightly
earthy
hop
bite
is
present
but
obviously
faded
alcohol
provides
a
bit
of
warming
but
luckily
is
not
as
strong
and
the
nose
suggested
medium
body
sweet
fruity
almost
sticky
mouthfeel
light
level
of
carbonation
not
having
this
fresh
really
skews
my
perspective
because
this
doesnt
seem
like
a
bock
to
me
this
is
a
pretty
good
old
ale
or
barleywine
at
this
point
i
enjoyed
it
o
i
assumed
an
11
abv
eisbock
would
be
sweet
when
fresh
i
hoped
at
13
months
old
it
would
have
mellowed
considerably
but
it
hasnt
this
one
might
need
several
years
to
mellow
tons
of
rich
toffee
and
caramel
initially
on
the
nose
once
it
warms
up
though
it
becomes
one
of
the
most
complex
aromas
i
have
ever
encountered
light
alcohol
notes
hints
of
dark
cherries
and
fruit
light
chocolate
and
almost
a
root
beer
like
touch
as
it
really
comes
up
near
room
temperature
to
say
the
aroma
was
inviting
would
be
an
understatement
this
was
intense
smooth
full
thick
body
on
this
one
really
let
the
flavor
just
coat
your
tongue
this
beer
was
on
tap
at
the
2010
acbf
i
managed
to
get
a
sample
of
it
when
red
hook
decided
that
they
were
going
to
tap
the
keg
they
brought
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
shade
of
amber
with
a
light
amount
of
haze
to
it
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
very
malty
had
a
sweetness
to
it
and
a
little
bit
of
booze
on
the
nose
the
taste
had
a
nice
amount
of
sweetness
to
it
with
a
lot
of
malt
in
there
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
at
this
point
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
a
little
thick
which
i
found
to
be
nice
overall
this
brew
is
worthy
of
trying
if
you
can
find
it
light
amber
reddish
body
clear
one
finger
white
head
some
visible
effervescence
quick
dissipation
with
minimal
lacing
bready
malts
in
the
nose
quite
boozy
aromas
balanced
by
some
caramel
malts
and
floral
hops
taste
mirrors
nose
the
booze
has
tamed
a
bit
caramel
and
bready
malts
counteract
the
abv
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
noticeable
alcohol
dry
finish
this
was
the
best
eisbock
of
the
tasting
and
to
be
honest
i
wouldnt
order
any
of
them
again
it
has
such
a
distinct
flavor
and
i
feel
like
i
should
be
able
to
place
it
but
i
cant
very
good
though
and
im
a
fan
o
redhook
impresses
with
a
very
well
done
eisbock
the
flavours
are
integrated
and
structured
well
and
never
cloying
a
very
enjoyable
nightcap
though
i
have
no
idea
why
they
bottled
this
in
bombers
poured
deep
roasted
pumpkin
clear
a
decent
off
white
head
that
left
a
slim
ring
lots
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
oh
yes
you
can
tell
this
is
high
gravity
nicely
sweet
with
a
bittersweet
finish
and
quite
warming
viscous
and
smooth
this
would
fit
very
well
as
a
barleywine
but
alas
it
is
an
eisbock
certainly
not
to
style
in
our
opinions
in
which
case
i
had
to
dock
a
point
overall
taste
is
candyish
and
thick
lots
of
caramel
and
the
alcohol
is
still
there
but
is
actually
quite
smooth
for
an
11er
i
could
see
this
getting
better
with
some
age
on
it
it
is
pretty
green
and
the
flavors
have
not
quite
come
together
fully
but
the
potential
is
there
creamy
and
soft
mouthfeel
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
worthy
redhook
rendition
of
the
eisbock
style
kudos
o
overall
this
beer
was
a
nice
addition
to
my
beer
library
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
would
definitely
consider
buying
again
d
a
good
drinker
for
its
strength
overall
a
wellcrafted
and
processed
brew
o
overall
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
easy
to
drink
even
at
11
the
rich
flavors
call
you
back
for
more
tastes
this
one
capped
off
a
long
day
and
glided
me
into
the
weekend
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
that
may
not
drive
straight
down
the
style
guidelines
but
would
buy
again
if
the
price
point
was
a
little
better
this
is
a
better
than
average
eisbock
there
are
preferred
choices
but
im
not
going
to
bitch
about
having
this
in
my
hand
mouth
stomach
bladder
plenty
solid
and
better
than
what
i
expected
d
okay
but
not
something
i
plan
to
revisit
not
an
easy
drinker
not
for
me
from
the
650
ml
bottle
stamped
aug30101448wa
sampled
on
march
5
2011
it
pours
into
the
dimped
mug
an
attractive
copper
color
with
virtually
no
head
ultrasweet
malts
begin
the
aroma
with
an
obvious
alcohol
background
there
is
also
a
hint
of
toffee
on
the
nose
the
body
is
medium
the
taste
was
a
puckerup
kind
of
sour
bitterness
but
at
the
same
time
smooth
and
creamy
a
dry
hop
ending
finishes
it
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
aftertaste
though
this
beer
has
some
good
flavor
although
its
a
bit
too
harsh
for
me
that
should
be
expected
with
its
high
abv
however
if
youre
in
extremely
cold
temperatures
and
you
want
something
to
warm
you
up
and
get
you
in
a
good
relaxed
mood
then
this
will
be
a
good
one
shared
a
22
with
my
father
left
feeling
that
my
experience
in
beer
has
been
expanded
a
good
beer
for
a
good
brewery
i
hope
on
trying
this
again
although
not
in
the
near
future
this
beer
is
not
meant
for
the
casual
beer
enthusiast
be
ready
for
a
hit
to
the
pallet
d
this
is
a
strong
beer
strong
on
the
alcohol
strong
on
the
malts
and
strong
on
the
hops
itll
knock
you
over
split
with
two
friends
one
was
almost
enough
wow
the
booze
is
well
hiidden
but
packs
a
wallop
d
big
beer
high
abv
very
sweet
one
of
the
few
eisbocks
readily
available
despite
being
a
limited
release
overall
a
pleasant
experience
pours
a
one
finger
khaki
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
nice
crystal

abv
eisbock
worth
trying
at
8
40
for
a
22oz
frosted
brown
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
nose
is
lacking
almost
absent
my
first
sip
was
surprising
by
the
complexity
from
a
redhook
beer
i
was
ipmressed
poured
slightly
too
cold
better
as
it
warmed
has
a
soft
maltyness
reminiscent
of
honey
without
being
overly
sweet
has
characteristics
of
an
aged
armengac
or
rum
wish
i
had
another
bottle
right
now
i
found
this
while
browsing
after
a
day
of
freezing
my
butt
off
figured
a
warmer
would
be
good
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
nice
clear
dark
amber
with
a
big
think
cream
colored
head
the
smell
is
very
fruity
with
a
little
sweet
caramel
also
a
light
alcohol
smell
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
not
syrupy
seems
to
fit
well
the
taste
is
fruit
up
front
followed
big
malty
sweet
caramel
maybe
a
little
coffee
too
also
a
noticeable
alcohol
taste
this
is
my
first
eisbock
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
its
good
but
probably
just
for
a
single
at
11
thats
probably
good
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
find
it
d
being
that
its
cold
here
in
iowa
and
its
a
nice
winter
warmer
its
fairly
drinkable
not
bad
in
any
one
category
but
doesnt
really
stand
out
to
me
either
for
the
heft
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
a
worthy
sipper
opinion
maybe
i
am
just
being
a
little
too
critical
but
this
beer
really
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
i
really
really
really
like
the
eisbock
style
and
this
beer
doesnt
suck
but
it
really
falls
short
of
what
i
would
expect
for
this
type
of
beer
in
my
mind
i
am
putting
it
up
against
kulmbacher
so
it
isnt
holding
up
well
at
all
that
said
i
plan
on
finishing
the
bottle
it
isnt
flawed
or
anything
but
just
lacks
the
definition
that
i
believe
makes
an
eisbock
poured
from
a
22
on
xmas
this
looked
promising
poured
bright
maroon
with
off
white
head
that
is
the
end
of
the
appeal
right
there
smelled
like
candy
in
a
gross
way
smarties
and
i
like
those
which
is
why
i
gave
a
2
corn
syrup
fruity
pebbles
it
was
seriously
overwhelming
as
there
was
nothing
beer
like
in
this
nose
taste
sugary
hot
like
cherry
cough
syrup
booze
vomit
and
pbr
this
beer
gave
me
a
headache
and
made
me
nauseous
after
15
minutes
of
trying
to
finish
the
3
ounces
of
my
22
ounce
glass
i
wanted
this
to
get
better
but
it
only
got
worse
in
flavor
as
time
progressed
the
mouthfeel
was
both
slippery
and
thin
at
the
same
time
this
in
conjunction
with
the
flavors
was
most
unappealing
a
medicinal
bitterness
mixed
with
artificial
sweetner
clung
to
my
palate
and
coated
my
tongue
i
ended
up
dumping
the
rest
down
the
drain
as
it
was
just
not
happening
maybe
there
was
something
in
the
beer
that
gave
me
an
adverse
reaction
i
dont
know
what
was
wrong
with
this
beer
but
i
doubt
ill
be
back
to
rereview
it
it
was
truly
unpleasant
pours
a
heavyhung
head
this
liquid
moves
like
its
still
frozen
slow
and
laboriously
the
nose
summons
tropical
fruits
and
something
not
yet
ripened
from
my
summer
garden
the
taste
clues
me
in
on
that
unripe
fruit
stillgreen
cherry
tomatoes
i
also
get
a
touch
of
bananas
foster
tagging
along
with
the
sweetness
an
expressive
bitterness
rides
a
wave
of
gushing
carbonation
and
i
find
this
the
most
appealing
aspect
of
the
entire
drinking
experience
apparently
despite
the
multiple
other
examples
ive
sampled
this
is
my
first
eisbock
review
i
dont
know
what
to
say
it
pours
a
clear
garnetamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
hot
cinnamon
buttery
biscuits
caramel
and
a
heaping
helping
of
wheat
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
toffee
buttery
biscuits
a
hint
of
plum
and
some
sort
of
fake
fruit
flavor
like
a
fake
cherry
or
strawberry
the
kind
youd
find
in
separate
sticks
of
fruit
stripe
gum
the
body
is
a
lightish
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
decently
solid
eisbock
but
i
dont
feel
like
id
ever
really
wanna
have
it
again
kinda
odd
in
that
way
but
im
not
gonna
try
too
hard
to
figure
it
out
any
further
this
beer
pours
a
red
color
usually
i
use
that
to
describe
some
auburn
or
deep
orange
or
mahogany
color
but
this
shit
is
red
there
isnt
much
head
to
it
at
all
though
it
is
looking
of
a
rather
nice
consistency
the
smell
is
mainly
of
sweet
malts
there
is
a
bit
of
a
fume
to
the
aroma
as
well
this
beer
tastes
like
a
malt
bomb
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
there
is
intense
rich
malt
tones
and
strong
fruity
flavors
from
the
yeast
but
there
is
really
little
to
no
complexity
to
this
flavor
that
is
just
sugary
black
cherry
syrup
the
artificial
taste
has
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
that
is
mildly
off
putting
its
much
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
up
but
overall
its
not
the
best
of
its
style
by
a
longshot
quite
the
treat
now
this
is
a
winter
warmer
no
messing
around
and
tasty
too
ontap
at
flying
saucer
charlotte
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
crisp
bubbly
copper
with
a
thin
khaki

aroma
is
slight
burnt
caramel
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
dried
fruits
in
front
of
sweet
caramel
and
mild
molasses
the
beer
is
certainly
a
bit
heavy
but
is
a
relatively
easy
sipper
this
is
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
one

may
have
again

malt
and

dominate
the

its
not
a
subtle

but
is
a

seriously
alcoholladen
hyperbock
aroma
the
taste
despite
the
serious

has
a

are

notes

toastyness
and

beer
better
with
ever
sip
id
come
back
to
this
again
once
and
a
while
its
a
good
warming
winter
brew
the
flavors
are
overall
clean
and
pleasant
with
some
interesting
complexity
nice
effort
here
taste
is
sweet
to
start
quickly
overcome
by
by
a
bitter
fruitiness
which
fades
into
a
hoppy
and
boozy
close
lots
of
numbness
after
the
swallow
mouthfeel
is
rough
and
tough
and
drinkability
is
okay
needs
some
time
to
meld
together
and
smooth
out
better
appearance
is
a
deep
amber
red
with
a
nice
head
that
eventually
fades
to
nill
with
no
lace
smell
of
pears
and
lighter
on
the
darker
fruits
spice
rich
malts
and
light
alchohol
considering
taste
has
a
big
fruity
maltiness
with
a
nice
round
of
hops
with
very
low
alchohol
on
the
buds
mouthfeel
is
a
viscous
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
healthy
winter
warmer
that
i
appreciate
this
time
of
year
d
a
great
sipping
beer
for
a
cold
day
drink
not
to
bad
kind
of
an
unassuming
11
drinker
leaves
some
things
on
the
table
and
i
think
the
flavor
profile
could
be
kicked
a
bit
while
bringing
it
down
to
a
89
d
this
gave
me
the
sense
of
a
good
bock
that
has
been
iced
for
more
power
scent
and
taste
were
enjoyable
but
not
great
the
body
was
ok
but
the
alcohol
was
strong
so
it
wasnt
very
easy
to
drink
age
may
help
improve
but
this
will
probably
never
rival
the
top
eisbocks
like
aventinus
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
caramel
and
toffee
along
with
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
and
some
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
brown
sugar
and
molasses
along
with
toffee
and
caramel
i
also
get
some

and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
medium

medium
carbonation
very
good
scarlet
red

slightly
hazed
thin
cap
of
dense
off

lacing
is
quite
full
rich
malty
sweet
aroma
with
a
little
hint
of
booze
on
the
sniffer
rich

flavors
as
well
rich
texture
vanilla
and
a
little
rum
caramel
and
nouget
smooth
and
near
full
body
alcohol
is
really
held
in
check
nicely
very
drinkable
and
quite

im
impressed
a
pretty
mild
drink
for
11
malty
and
smooth
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
pour
is
deep
amber
with
a
sticky
2
inch
white
head
lots
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
the
beer
has
lots
of
caramel
and
alcohol
and
it
finishes
with
some
lingering
heat
the
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
kind
of
a
sticky
feel
to
it
to
me
more
of
an
english
barley
wine
decent
beer
the
body
was
ok
a
bit
thin
and
a
little
sticky
drinkability
was
ok
but
nothing
special
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
but
not
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
nice
clear
copperbrown
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
that
faded
slowly
and
laced
well
somewhat
grassy
notes
and
subtle
malt
sweetness
malty
caramel
notes
are
magnified
by
the
booze
and
its
got
a
bit
of
earthiness
and
light
hops
adding
to
its
bittersweet
flavor
thick
chewy
body
with
light
carbonation
and
a
naturally
boozy
finish
a
single
bomber
is
enough
for
one
sitting
enjoyable
but
too
much
and
too
rich
to
consume
all
the
time
still
a
solid
offering
from
a
brewery
often
criticized
for
boring
everyday
beers
but
has
found
a
niche
in
its
reserve
series
a
good
sipper
for
the
autumnal
weather
but
remember
to
serve
it
warm
this
is
just
a
fine
beer
all
around
there
is
nothing
i
really
dislike
about
it
all
and
the
bottle
is
kinda
cool
too
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
very
heavy
bodied
this
is
definitely
something
to
sip
because
of
the
mouthfeel
but
still
something
that
goes
down
pretty
easily
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
something
overly
impressive
notes
for
a
winter
beer
it
is
not
bad
strong
sweet
and
warming
its
not
an
amazing
eisbock
or
an
amazing
beer
in
general
but
it
can
be
a
nice
beer
to
share
with
family
and
friends
inside
on
a
cold
day
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
a
reasonable
attempt
at
an
eisbock
always
a
style
i
like
to
see
so
im
probably
biased
to
like
it
but
beyond
that
its
only
soso
its
getting
tougher
to
drink
the
booze
begins
to
scream
as
it
warms
thats
not
a
good
thing
its
probably
worse
than
im
giving
it
credit
for
but
im
gonna
quit
this
review
while
im
somewhat
ahead
overall
not
the
best
eisbock
in
the
world
rather
boring
for
the
style
might
be
nice
for
the
winter
but
i
would
rather
pick
up
something
else
i
like
eisbocks
so
picked
this
one
up
very
sweet
but
not
cloying
sweet
fruity
candy
to
the
taste
buds
a
nice
changeup
from
the
usual
hop
dominated
beers
i
usually
have
the
huge
sweetness
and
alcohol
punch
just
wears
down
the
palate
initially
this
is
very
enjoyable
if
a
little
simplistic
though
overall
just
to
much
for
me
anyway
cheers
to
redhook
for
doing
something
different
and
something
that
is
worth
a
try
however
notes
a
couple
of
bucks
cheaper
and
it
would
be
an
easy
pick
up
over
and
over
till
its
gone
for
this
kid
one
more
pickup
will
have
to
do
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
bad
overall
but
not
great
either
it
had
some
decent
malty
flavors
but
the
spice
coming
through
didnt
really
help
it
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
one
id
probably
try
only
once
1283
body
is
light
compared
to
others
of
this
style
but
just
as
sticky
finishes
really
sweet
and
warming
drinkable
in
small
doses
but
i
rarely
have
trouble
putting
down
a
bomber
and
im
not
sure
i
need
to
finish
this
d
not
bad
but
not
special
either
wanted
to
pick
one
of
these
up
when
i
thought
it
was
a
true
eisbock
and
when
i
found
out
this
was
not
the
case
i
figured
what
the
hell
and
bought
one
anyway
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
a
tan
head
on
top
aroma
of
cherries
bready
malt
and
candy
apples
on
the
palate
this
one
is
pretty
heavy
sweet
and
alcoholic
light
tart
fruit
caramel
and
toffee
a
solid
effort
from
red
hook
the
beer
style
lives
up
to
its
reputation
being
a
thick
chewy
syruplike
brew
due
to
the
removal
of
water
not
a
beer
i
would
have
with
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
this
one
is
definitely
one
to
be
paired
with
meat
like
a
nice
big
turkey
leg
or
a
tbone
steak
while
watching
the
football
game
let
it
warm
a
bit
and
you
have
a
pretty
decent
little
coldweather
beverage
d
at
least
you
know
you
are
getting
fked
when
you
drink
this
and
maybe
will
pace
it
cool
to
see
a
brewery
like
redhook
take
on
a
rarely
brewed
style
like
eisbock
color
is
a
clear
honey
orangeamber
with
just
a
ring
of
lacing
honey
and
wild
flowers
flow
from
the
nose
along
with
a
tiny
amount
of
peach
nectar
and
strawberries
big
fruit
and
honey
in
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
boozy
punch
to
it
the
sweetness
can
be
a
bit
much
at
times
but
it
definitely
is
loaded
with
complexity
body
is
pretty
slick
and
alcoholic
but
it
certainly
went
down
easily
for
me
a
good
example
of
this
style
not
really
but
who
really
cares
when
there
are
so
few
of
them
out
there
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
bit
of
booze
with
nice
flavor
this
beer
is
the
one
to
reach
for
cheers
im
gonna
have
to
grab
a
few
more
of
these
and
keep
them
for
the
first
big
snow
day
not
overly
exciting
but
well
priced
sort
of
a
nice
try
i
guess
sometimes
less
is
more
here
more
is
less
poured
with
a
fine
small
off
white
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
red
amber
and
no
bubble
trails
aroma
is
massive
caramel
malt
a
little
toffee
flavor
is
first
malt
sweet
then
like
aroma
and
alcohol
body
is
big
and
round
as
expected
for
this
kind
a
beer
finish
is
like
flavor
and
lasts
a
while
im
only
drinking
part
of
the
sample
and
no
mas
d
tough
this
one
burns
the
nasal
cavity
super
hot
beer
it
is
a
bit
on
the
wild
side
but
i
could
see
on
a
cold
winters
day
this
being
pretty
appetizing
d
not
extremely
drinkable
well
hidden
abv
but
also
nasty
enough
to
roll
you
not
very
filling
sugary
notes
get
a
little
wearing
edit
reading
back
through
some
of
the
reviews
it
seems
that
many
whove
tried
this
beer
did
not
detect
much
in
the
way
of
hops
interesting
drink
it
slow
and
how
downlow
on
the
hillside
of
fields
of
gold
run
by
the
river
she
may
give
you
a
name
if
your
lucky
but
keep
an
open
mind
for
its
best
for
all
to
let
it
happen
on
the
run
a
large
snifter
glass
at
the
temp
when
its
slightly
warm
to
take
from
the
fridge
and
head
down
south
in
the
morning
watch
the
old
men
sing
songs
of
eisbocks
of
old
and
in
the
meantime
a
redhook
fishin
reel
just
wait
and
see
mouthfeel
prickly
medium
light
body
strong
alcohol
warmth
even
sharp
low
carbonation

well
13
in
san
diego
seems
a
little
much
for
a
beer
that
seems
to
have
been
made
with
one
tank
truck
of
corn
sugar
and
another
of
industrial
alcohol
but
if
you
like
beer
oddities
youll
want
to
try
this
one
this
was
a
robust
and
filling
beer
one
of
the
best
efforts
from
redhook
that
ive
tried
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
has
beer
has
a
very
smooth
syrupy
mouthfeel
drinkability
isnt
real
high
because
you
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
as
an
eisbock
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
so
i
am
reviewing
to
style
here
not
too
bad
for
an
illegal
us
style
according
to
us
law
technically
this
is
considered
distillation
so
it
is
a
liquor
not
a
beer
hope
red
hook
doesnt
get
in
trouble
with
this
overall
not
bad
i
bet
this
would
get
much
better
with
some
age
on
it
certainly
one
to
drink
cold
at
this
point
at
least
until
it
mellowed
out
after
a
couple
years
pours
a
nice
mahogany
color
with
a
surprisingly
resilient
tan
head
that
leaves
pretty
lacing
impressive
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
the
aroma
is
classic
eisbock
with
strong
toffee
and
caramel
notes
along
with
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
fig
plum
black
cherry
oak
vanilla
turbinado
sugar
and
a
wallop
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
huge
malty
sweetness
reminiscent
of
molasses
toffee
caramel
and
brown
sugar
as
well
as
dark
fruits
black
cherry
fig
and
plum
some
herbal
hops
oak
vanilla
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
and
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
really
enjoyable
eisbock
not
quite
on
the
level
of
samichlaus
but
not
far
off
either
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
the
same
class
as
kulmbacher
but
its
still
a
good
effort
ok
this
beer
is
oddly
bitter
and
super
dry
its
mildly
sweet
but
the
dryness
is
not
endearing
this
beer
to
me
there
is
this
almost
hop
like
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
beer
this
makes
this
a
rough
road
beer
for
me
im
going
in
again
its
a
little
fruity
in
the
midpalate
the
second
sip
was
better
than
the
first
but
the
bitterness
and
the
dryness
do
not
play
well
together
unfortunately
still
not
a
fan
of
redhook
pour
is
beautiful
even
for
a
plastic
cup
haha
dark
translucent
mahogany
with
an
initially
massive
dense
tan
colored
head
remains
a
finger
thick
throughout
and
also
completely
covers
the
cup
in
sheets
of
lacing
aroma
is
much
richer
and
stronger
than
the
eis
maibock
toasted
malt
dark
fruit
chocolate
raisins
etc
dominate
the
nose
body
is
well
carbonated
and
medium
thick
with
a
lingering
chewy
malty
nuttiness
flavor
has
much
better
managed
alcohol
than
the
eis
maibock
and
is
a
rich
blend
of
initially
sweet
dark
fruits
complex
crystal
malts
before
a
mild
coffee
and
nuttiness
takes
over
my
favorite
eisbock
of
the
day
and
a
nice
variant
of
the
regular
instigator
d
a
very
full
flavored
beer
and
well
concealed
alcohol
for
the
style
the
malt
is
smooth
and
makes
for
a
drinkable
eisbock
which
i
didnt
really
expect
a
big
lager
with
plenty
of
umph
and
still
drinkable
too
much
nyquil
going
on
here
not
sure
how
you
could
drink
more
than
2
oz
very
glad
i
got
to
sample
this
at
the
kbs
bottle
share
also
glad
i
never
paid
30
or
traded
for
it
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
it
just
looks
syrupy
the
smell
is
concentrated
raspberry
puree
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
almost
port
like
the
taste
is
pretty
incredible
for
a
15
5
beer
fresh
just
bursting
with
fresh
raspberry
flavor
with
a
bit
more
chocolate
on
the
finish
not
much
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
rather
syrupy
but
to
be
expected
overall
this
beer
is
a
pretty
amazing
achievement
the
bottle
was
split
between
four
people
and
the
34
oz
taster
was
all
i
needed
as
it
was
quite
sweet
and
almost
became
slightly
medicinal
the
more
i
sipped
on
it
but
it
is
some
pretty
incredible
liquid
and
i
am
excited
to
see
what
a
few
years
of
age
does
to
one
of
these
this
is
beer
stretched
out
as
far
as
you
can
go
while
still
being
beer
really
really
great
serve
w
liqueur
chocolates
plum
raisin
and
fig
excellent
eisbock
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
my
first
eisbock
and
proabbly
my
last
drinkable
but
hard
to
classify
as
beer
tastes
more
like
sparkling
wine
than
a
beer
starts
with
an
amazing
raspberry
flavor
like
a
perfect
raspberry
and
not
artificial
at
all
some
dark
chocolate
slips
in
there
as
well
great
balance
a
wonderful
beer
kbe
and
2014
kre
are
so
different
its
ridiculous
loved
kbe
too
bad
ill
likely
never
get
to
have
it
again
did
not
like
kre
one
bit
this
beer
tasted
like
thin
cough
syrup
to
me
o
excellent
beer
one
of
the
first
eisbocks
ive
tried
its
very
balanced
yet
extremely
flavourful
and
enjoyable
to
sip
on
a
bit
of
a
novelty
in
concept
but
in
execution
its
a
very
nice
beer
and
if
youre
a
cellarobsessive
i
am
sure
it
could
age
for
decades
i
am
definitely
more
interested
in
trying
blueberry
eisbock
now
too
thick
and
cough
syrup
not
what
i
expected
ffor
the
abv
found
this
incredibly
easy
to
drink
sure
a
few
pours
will
put
you
off
your
feet
but
kre
is
an
astonishingly
great
effort
i
highly
recommend
this
one
if
you
can
get
it
i
have
one
more
bottle
but
am
going
to
age
it
for
a
while
and
perhaps
trade
it
for
something
interesting
in
the
future
well
see
great
smell
but
tastes
like
overly
boozey
fruit
punch
kuhnhenns
raspberry
eisbock
is
delicious
in
its
simple
elegance
this
is
my
first
real
eisbock
and
if
this
is
whay
can
be
expected
im
interested
in
trying
more
worth
a
try
for
sure
if
you
have
the
opportunity
overall
i
had
very
high
expectations
for
this
and
it
even
surpassed
them
amazing
beer
only
qualm
is
the
lack
of
the
bock
and
malts
on
the
flavor
serving
type
bottle
tastes
like
raspberry
jam
with
an
injection
of
booze
decent
but
highly
letdown
by
this
one
o
really
interesting
eisbock
reminiscent
of
chocolatecovered
raspberries
big
rich
flavors
in
this
one
though
its
fairly
onenote
chocolate
covered
rasperries
from
start
to
finish
does
not
taste
as
boozy
as
youd
expect
for
15
5
but
it
still
lets
you
know
that
its
a
bruiser
balance
is
superb
and
the
drinkability
is
topnotch
for
the
abv
this
is
a
brand
new
batch
and
unfortunately
it
ha
a
very
medicinal
taste
and
smell
that
does
not
justify
the
incredibly
high
ratings
i
have
seen
straight
up
boozy
raspberry
jam
damn
only
lone
star
would
use
raspberry
really
disappointed
by
this
after
all
the
hype
tastes
like
carbonated
raspberry
syrup
would
be
a
nice
pancake
topper
if
reduced
down
to
about
13
its
volume
but
at
30
bucks
a
bottle
youre
better
off
going
to
ihop
its
like
alcoholic
raspberry
jam
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
for
it
being
well
outside
of
my
comfort
zone
i
have
equally
as
much
respect
for
how
well
it
is
crafted
the
balance
of
sweet
heat
and
chocolate
is
perfect
o
unless
im
mistaken
kre
is
actually
better
than
kbe
amazing
not
much
more
to
say
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
is
the
most
i
have
paid
per
ounce
of
beer
but
it
was
three
years
old
when
i
bought
it
it
is
good
i
wish
i
had
twelve
ounces
to
enjoy
but
i
feel
fortunate
to
have
gotten
to
try
it
good
beer
to
celebrate
turning
40
tastes
like
double
crooked
tree
with
a
hint
of
pumkin
and
spice
raspberry
juice
with
the
feel
of
a
nice
berry
cocktail
atop
of
semibitter
chocolate
for
15
it
really
doesnt
come
close
to
feeling
that
way
raspberry
truffle
beer
oh
my
a
great
drinking
experience
all
around
and
an
excellent
beer
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
this
is
an
awesome
huge
raspberry
beer
the
raspberry
is
amazingly
pronounced
but
wonderful
other
players
include
chocolate
vanilla
toffee
molasses
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
im
definitely
glad
i
drank
the
whole
375
ml
bottle
big
thanks
to
adam
for
getting
this
to
me
in
trade
2012
bottle
with
red
wax
poured
in
a
firestone
walker
teku
on
february
13
2014
pours
bright
and
dark
red
with
no
head
at
all
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
huge
sweet
raspberry
and
booze
aroma
some
caramel
or
toffee
lots
of
sweet
syrupy
sugar
smell
so
much
sweet
berry
flavor
is
sweet
straight
raspberry
jampreserves
and
then
some
toffee
like
malts
tingling
the
tongue
with
plenty
of
booze
in
the
background
this
is
very
sweet
with
a
thick
nearly
syrupy
mouthfeel
but
balanced
with
some
light
carbonation
as
to
make
it
more
drinkable
huge
flavors
in
this
brew
for
sure
made
for
the
raspberry
lover
very
nice
and
a
bit
hot
an
awesome
treat
as
an
after
dinner
drink
just
make
sure
to
pour
yourself
a
small
glass
around
4
oz
tough
to
drink
much
more
than
that
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
and
extremely
tasty
its
taken
a
while
but
im
finally
getting
a
crack
at
this
beast
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
ruby
topped
by
a
halffinger
at
most
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
deep
raspberry
jam
a
twinge
of
what
seems
like
vanilla
bean
in
the
background
and
a
slight
sense
of
vinyl
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
raspberries
shining
some
mild
booze
creeping
in
and
the
vinyl
coming
through
as
a
stronger
pall
of
plastic
this
plasticness
doesnt
fade
the
body
is
a
light
hefty
with
a
relatively
light
carbonation
and
a
thickly
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
enough
fruited
eisbock
but
that
plastic
character
is
in
no
way
endearing
and
kind
of
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
in
both
manners
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
i
cant
figure
out
how
kuhnhenn
packed
that
flavor
into
this
beer
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
case
of
this
stuff
thanks
for
the
bottle
derek
pours
a
deep
dark
red
burgundy
that
leaves
behind
no
head
nor
lacing
throughout
aroma
has
notes
of
malt
caramel
chocolate
and
raspberries
the
flavor
gave
off
a
heavy
sweet
and
light
bitter
with
a
long
fruity
raspberry
lots
of
them
and
caramel
finish
full
mouthfeel
along
with
an
oilysticky
texture
and
the
carbonation
was
flat
throughout
overall
quite
tasty
beer
with
some
underlying
raspberrylike
booze
to
finish
off
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
and
i
probably
will
not
seek
this
one
out
as
it
is
reported
to
be
30
a
bottle
similar
characteristics
to
the
2012
except
the
heat
was
gone
less
raspberry
and
more
chocolate
flavor
i
prefered
this
to
the
2012
but
it
is
still
not
a
beer
i
particularly
enjoy
o
definitely
worth
a
try
i
dont
think
id
pay
top
dollar
or
trade
away
whalezbro
to
obtain
this
beer
but
it
was
definitely
a
nice
experience
and
i
hope
to
come
across
it
again
sometime
o
near
perfect
one
of
the
top
handful
of
beers
ive
had
all
time
world
class
such
a
nice
beer
nowhere
near
as
boozey
as
you
would
think
a
15
beer
would
be
kuhnehenn
continues
to
amaze
this
is
a
damn
expensive
beer
about
15
for
6oz
at
the
brewery
but
you
should
include
this
as
part
of
your
sample
paddle
this
is
something
that
any
beerwinemead
drinker
would
enjoy
i
think
o
extremely
interesting
beer
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
before
im
sure
this
will
develop
significantly
with
some
time
but
i
didnt
feel
the
alcohol
warmth
was
sufficient
to
detract
from
the
experience
this
wasnt
underwhelming
it
was
unpleasant
would
not
be
interested
in
revisiting
o
this
is
a
bit
thinner
and
boozier
than
i
would
have
liked
interesting
beer
but
not
quite
up
to
the
hype
o
this
is
a
light
raspberry
boozy
beer
with
some
light
chocolate
the
medicinal
notes
reminded
of
jaeger
o
a
very
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
lots
of
raspberry
but
not
that
fresh
raspberry
flavor
that
you
find
in
beers
such
as
blushing
monk
or
raspberry
tart
quite
a
big
and
syrupy
beer
that
should
be
sipped
with
friends
a
couple
ounces
is
more
than
enough
overall
i
wish
the
allergies
hadnt
been
acting
up
so
i
can
be
sure
what
i
smelled
and
tasted
was
accurate
i
had
to
rate
it
as
i
perceived
it
as
a
rare
chance
for
any
ohioan
to
do
so
very
often
i
was
very
happy
to
be
there
in
kuhnhenns
where
so
much
magic
goes
down
o
this
was
good
but
it
definitely
needs
some
time
the
boozy
notes
are
right
up
front
and
need
some
time
to
settle
in
o
like
a
raspberryfilled
chocolate
truffle
nice
digestif
manages
to
be
sweet
but
not
cloying
if
i
had
any
complaints
it
would
be
that
the
beer
leans
towards
onedimensional
but
it
succeeds
at
what
it
attempts
it
pours
a
clear
deep
red
with
brown
hues
and
a
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
the
smell
is
amazing
cocoa
nibs
and
and
fresh
raspberries
i
couldnt
stop
smelling
it
the
taste
is
even
more
impressive
then
the
nose
it
taste
like
fresh
chocolate
covered
raspberries
im
not
sure
how
the
keep
the
raspberries
from
tasting
like
a
syrup
and
being
overly
sweet
the
body
is
medium
thick
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
sweet
but
not
cloying
finish
this
is
with
out
a
doubt
one
of
the
most
incredible
beers
i
have
ever
tried
im
really
happy
i
was
able
to
try
some
and
really
glad
i
made
the
choice
to
spend
the
money
to
try
it
easily
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
a
really
one
of
a
kind
bottle
of
beer
here
all
the
thanks
in
the
world
to
thebrewo
for
hooking
this
one
up
for
me
via
trade
the
pour
is
the
least
impressive
feature
with
brown
and
red
meeting
in
the
middle
in
terms
of
color
and
only
paltry
carbonation
resulting
in
almost
no
head
it
looks
more
like
a
glass
of
wine
which
is
okay
in
this
context
the
nose
hits
like
a
freight
train
super
fresh
raspberries
abound
not
like
genetically
modified
grocery
store
berries
but
fresh
picked
off
the
pricker
bush
middle
of
august
berry
there
is
also
some
bitter
cocoa
in
there
too
giving
the
scent
of
chocolate
covered
fruit
the
alcohol
does
have
an
aroma
but
it
isnt
nearly
as
biting
as
one
would
expect
in
a
beer
over
15
abv
the
flavor
is
a
glorious
combination
of
raspberries
and
chocolate
and
wood
i
get
so
much
organic
fruit
not
syrups
or
extracts
but
straight
up
farmers
market
the
chocolate
creeps
in
slowly
and
is
more
like
bakers
chocolate
than
anything
else
there
is
some
sweetness
from
the
berries
as
well
as
from
the
middle
of
the
road
malt
profile
the
alcohol
isnt
tasted
until
the
very
finish
but
then
becomes
quite
hot
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
even
more
potent
but
the
beer
still
finishes
with
a
drying
feeling
carbonation
is
underwhelming
but
thats
indicative
of
the
style
more
than
anything
and
the
body
is
plenty
big
its
certainly
a
bottle
to
share
but
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
fruit
beers
i
can
ever
remember
drinking
thanks
again
to
thebrewo
for
making
this
experience
possible
its
a
trip
in
a
glass
sampled
the
new
batch
ultra
fresh
sweet
raspberry
on
the
nose
reminds
me
of
chambord
subtle
chocolate
just
overall
very
sweet
and
boozy
excellent
beer
tonight
will
forever
be
the
night
i
had
my
first
eisbock
the
labor
that
goes
into
a
beer
like
this
alone
makes
it
one
of
the
most
special
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
privilege
of
experiencing
it
pours
a
beautiful
syrupy
ruby
red
rusted
gold
color
it
smells
like
chocolate
covered
raspberry
explosion
the
taste
is
a
fruit
bomb
like
no
other
i
have
ever
experienced
extreme
thickness
and
depth
here
the
fruit
is
layered
in
a
way
that
is
so
precious
an
elite
bottle
of
beer
and
more
of
an
experience
than
a
beverage
wow
so
good
its
silly
cherish
every
sip
thank
you
stonedtrippin
for
putting
this
beer
in
my
world
you
are
both
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
o
very
impressive
beer
would
love
to
try
the
blueberry
really
unique
and
refreshing
although
im
glad
i
split
this
with
someone
else
in
the
end
dont
go
in
thinking
this
is
a
sour
or
anything
this
is
a
combination
of
a
strong
lager
with
a
raspberry
liqueur
first
and
foremost
and
yet
theres
a
candied
flavor
and
grassy
rustic
nature
that
makes
this
really
interesting
in
the
long
run
its
definitely
sweet
but
it
has
these
funky
aromas
and
juicy
character
found
in
doppelbocks
and
sweetened
lambics
that
makes
it
unlike
anything
ive
had
definitely
an
alcoholic
monster
though
so
watch
how
you
handle
it
absolutely
worth
a
try
o
this
was
certainly
a
special
treat
glad
to
have
tried
it
glad
i
didnt
have
to
trade
for
it
o
just
wow
this
is
really
an
amazing
beer
i
may
be
a
wordsmith
but
it
was
best
described
to
me
by
someone
else
kre
is
raspberry
french
toast
in
a
glass
its
kind
of
an
unreal
beer
and
it
really
makes
you
wonder
how
on
earth
the
managed
this
flavor
maybe
i
need
to
get
a
hold
of
kbe
too
as
far
as
fruitforward
goes
this
mofo
takes
the
pancake
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
strong
flavoring
with
hugely
inclusive
raspberry
authenticity
cooling
vanilla
cut
and
expertly
hidden
booziness
this
all
blends
to
make
a
highly
drinkable
brew
given
that
abv
honestly
through
and
through
this
is
not
very
complex
swill
but
it
remains
true
to
what
is
advertised
just
on
a
bigger
scale
than
you
might
have
prepared
for
with
warmth
the
booze
certainly
blossoms
but
otherwise
is
well
hidden
through
the
nose
and
the
palate
this
beer
is
undeniably
huge
and
takes
courage
to
tackle
but
if
youve
got
the
patience
and
the
friends
to
share
with
it
is
a
rare
true
treat
o
im
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
money
but
its
definitely
a
crazy
brew
id
love
to
put
a
bottle
away
for
a
few
years
longer
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
high
abv
offering
that
made
me
say
wow
but
kre
accomplishes

is

of
making
special
and
rare
beers
but
winter
wonder
lager
continues
to
be
one
of
my
favourites
in
their
portfolio
theres
as
few
beers
like
this
one
as
there
are
places
to
buy
it
if
youre
ever
in
the
detroit
area
and
happen
to
spot
a
bottle
dont
pass
on
it
overall
a
very

and
enjoyable
higher
abv
brew
for
sure
not
as
hot
as
i
had
assumed
it
would
be
either
in
the
end
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
over
an
evening
which
i
gladly
did
a
better
look
would
help
make
the
experience
more
enjoyable

that
is

o
honestly
this
is
probably
only
the
3rd

4th
eisbock
i
have
ever
had
but
this
one
is
really
inviting
on
a
cold
winters
day
rich
and
sweet
but
with
its
very
bubble
gum
forward
yeast
profile
this
is
an
intriguing
take
on
the
style
based
upon
the
others
i
have
had
kind
of
wish
i
had
gotten
a
few
more
to
see
what
time
does
to
it
overall
the
alcohol
is
just
a
bit
too
overwhelming
and
the
flavors
are
not
particularly
welldefined
big
thanks
goes
out
to
the
gbx
crew
beeruser
funkydelic
for
sharing
this
one
during
a
recent
tasting
2009
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
oversized
wine
glass
poured
a
brownish
orange
with
a
very
minimal
offwhite
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
sugar
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
sweet
alcohol
sugar
and
wood
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
really
was
surprised
by
this
one
upon
inspection
with
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
the
sweet
alcohol
aspect
on
this
one
is
really
what
sealed
the
deal
for
me
on
this
one
it
added
a
nice
level
of
complexity
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
to
do
so
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
grain
and
with
a
dose
of
sugar
and
grapes
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
grapes
and
brown
sugar
as
well
as
some
cherries
and
a
ton
of
booziness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
palate
on
the
other
hand
is
a
lot
more
flavorful
quite
sweet
almost
bitingly
so
with
a
definite
kirschwasser
taste
fruit
and
almondlike
pit
tannins
some
fruit
dried
apples
raisins
and
prunes
as
well
as
a
little
leather
are
present
the
alcohol
is
present
and
potent
though
not
as
prominent
as
id
expect
apart
from
a
little
caramel
though
this
does
start
to
fall
off
on
the
palate
bitter
almond
skins
on
the
finish
with
brown
sugar
a
little
licorice
and
some
prunes
this
beer
is
full
in
body
lightly
carbonated
decent
enjoyable
even
in
24oz
servings
but
12oz
is
a
bit
of
a
chore
o
it
isnt
winter
but
this
winter
was
a
wonder
and
this
beer
is
supreme
for
an
eisbock
if
you
arent
looking
for
big
bold
malt
bomb
with
a
smooth
glazing
of
13
then
this
is
not
for
you
however
if
you
are
looking
for
that
this
beer
hits
it
loved
it
overall
it
was
good
and
it
tasted
great
for
how
high
the
abv
was
but
it
just
wasnt
worth
7
a
bottle
d
no
thanks
1
o
nice
sipper
lots
of
different
notes
from
toffee
caramel
bready
fruit
and
chocolate
i
was
glad
the
beer
did
not
taste
and
feel
like
the
smell
intense
alcohol
overall
pretty
good
a
nice
end
of
the
year
beer
to
drink
the
booze
is
definitely
there
but
not
quite
drinking
like
a
13
maybe
more
like
910
not
sure
if
thats
the
sweetness
balancing
it
or
the
age
but
more
drinkable
than
expected
quite
sweet
too
syrupy
nice
malt
flavors
and
wheats
bock
flavors
etc
the
sweetness
is
dominant
but
goes
fairly
well
overall
and
not
crippling
cheers
o
i
like
eisbocks
and
i
like
kuhnhenn
but
this
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
tons
of
rich
toffee
and
caramel
initially
on
the
nose
once
it
warms
up
though
it
becomes
one
of
the
most
complex
aromas
i
have
ever
encountered
light
alcohol
notes
hints
of
dark
cherries
and
fruit
light
chocolate
and
almost
a
root
beer
like
touch
as
it
really
comes
up
near
room
temperature
to
say
the
aroma
was
inviting
would
be
an
understatement
this
was
intense
smooth
full
thick
body
on
this
one
really
let
the
flavor
just
coat
your
tongue
and
again
this
was
an
expierence
all
its
own
a
malt
monster
caramel
and
light
molasses
notes
led
the
charge
until
a
soothing
candy
like
chocolate
and
toffee
notes
come
in
but
it
was
the
fruit
like
cherry
notes
and
rich
cola
flavor
that
set
it
apart
this
is
an
epic
brawling
rude
inyourface
big
beer
with
a
ton
of
depth
taste
not
to
mention
the
58
alcohol
very
good
overall
i
was
pretty
ambivalent
about
this
beer
nothing
was
not
badly
but
nothing
made
me
excited
about
my
next
sip
either
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
especially
if
eisbocks
are
your
thing
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
some
amber
coloring
in
there
as
well
very
thin
offwhite
head
and
a
few
legs
down
the
side
of
the
glass
slight
collar
nose
is
loaded
with
dark
fruits
and
some
alcohol
slightly
spicy
as
well
taste
is
a
bit
oxidized
and
really
quite
warm
warm
as
in
lots
of
booze
even
for
an
eisbock
low
carbonation
decent
but
probably
way
too
young
normally
kuhnhenn
hides
alcohol
better
than
this
beer
is
sweet
and
much
thicker
than
i
was
expecting
its
not
bad
tasting
at
all
its
just
a
little
simple
its
sweet
with
a
mild
alcoholic
bite
and
a
relatively
plain
finish
easy
drinking
for
a
13
beer
and
as
far
as
eisbocks
go
it
was
above
average
in
my
opinion
id
have
it
again
except
i
trend
toward
the
lower
abv
spectrum
on
beers
prost
beertracker
not
enjoyable
maybe
this
will
be
better
with
time
but
not
ready
yet
d
very
solid
and
perfect
for
this
cold
and
snowy
christmas
eve
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
and
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
one
ages
recommend
overall
another
winner
from
kuhnhenn
this
beer
provides
the
warmth
similar
to
a
lot
of
the
other
big
kuhnhenn
beers
i
had
no
idea
what
the
style
was
on
this
one
when
i
opened
it
but
at
first
smell
i
knew
it
was
bigger
than
a
typical
lager
get
some
bottle
2007
vintage
poured
into
a
ccb
snifter
pours
an
opaque
rusty
mahagony
color
with
zero
head
only
a
razor
thin
collar
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
intriguing
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
like
cherry
plum
and
raisin
the
booze
is
pretty
evident
upon
the
first
sip
of
this
brew
not
in
a
bad
way
but
in
a
lets
just
sip
on
this
way
sweet
and
malty
with
a
heavy
mouthfeel
this
beer
starts
sweet
with
dark
fruit
notes
that
transitions
to
a
long
drawn
out
finish
with
some
bitterness
big
and
chewy
alcohol
warms
you
as
you
drink
pretty
nice
although
the
lingering
bitterness
is
not
that
pleasing
4
0
d
another
solid
effort
from
kuhnhenn
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
but
good
overall
perhaps
i
did
not
have
this
beer
under
the
best
circumstances
but
it
was
damn
near
undrinkable
it
was
a
cool
night
but
this
beer
really
warms
you
up
it
has
the
aroma
of
christmas
time
and
the
look
of
a
dortmunder
the
cluster
of
flavors
just
bombards
you
but
nonetheless
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
at
all
i
only
had
a
taste
luckily
because
i
could
not
have
taken
anything
more
than
this
way
too
alcoholic
to
drink
more
than
4
ounces
wow
hot
mess
rocket
fuel
for
beer
snobs
above
average
drinkability
for
the
abv
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
definitely
not
a
great
one
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
when
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
i
really
liked
it
this
review
is
from
a
bottle
with
a
few
months
age
and
it
starts
to
marinate
on
itself
and
lose
some
of
the
nuances
that
it
had
fresh
odd
as
many
beers
develop
nuance
as
they
age

an

its
definitely
an

that
is

with

this

has
a

going

seems
like
its
done
in

rough

all

for

so

alcohol
although
it
wasnt
as
hot
as
i
was
expecting
sweet
caramel
a
peppery
spiciness
overall
quite
sweet
and
a
bit
boozy
medium
to
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
levels
a
noticeable
alcohol
burn
in
the
throat
after
each
sip
the
sweetness
gets
to
you
after
a
bit
and
that
hurts
the
drinkability
plan
to
spend
an
hour
plus
sipping
this
one
or
better
yet
share
it
with
a
friend
or
two
this
would
probably
be
a
little
better
if
i
had
given
it
some
time
to
mellow
as
is
it
is
a
little
too
hot
and
boozy
i
find
it
to
be
quite
easy
to
drink
as
a
oneanddone
kind
of
bottle
you
wont
really
want
to
slam
back
multiples
in
a
session
d
not
like
other
eisbocks
in
drinkability
and
smoothness
d
this
is
a
definite
sipper
and
its
going
to
take
me
over
an
hour
to
finish
a
12oz
bottle
i
dont
like
it
quite
as
much
as
the
eisbock
cassis
or
5th
dementia
but
its
still
a
decent
brew
with
wellhidden
alcohol
id
be
interested
to
try
this
fresh
and
it
looks
like
i
might
get
the
chance
at
the
winter
solstice
party
overall
a
solid
example
these
malt
bombs
are
not
particularly
my
bag
but
i
am
sure
many
would
like
this
d
sorry
too
big
and
too
big
one
is
good
and
i
hope
i
get
another
in
the
future
very
much
a
barleywine
smells
like
a
barleywine
or
an
eisbock

mouthfeel
this
is
emminently
drinkable

it
looks
thick

barleywine
sugar
and
background
spice
lots
of
caramel
malt
dangeroudly
drinkable
kuhnhenn
makes
kick
ass
beer
this
is
simply
another
example
it
really
is
very
good
i
do
think
itd
be
slightly
improved
with
a
little
less
sweetness
and
a
lower
abv
those
two
tweaks
would
really
drive
this
beer
to
excellence
as
it
is
its
very
good
definitely
worth
seeking
out
thanks
for
the
bottle
derek
d
a
hot
bloody

maybe
this
is
too
old
maybe
its
just
bad
this
is
not
all
that
interesting

good

very
strong
with
an
unattractive

d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
probably
held
onto
this
one
a
little
bit
too
long
but
its
still
a
good
beer
to
sip
on
for
a
while
more
like
a
midwest
triple
bock
wow
not
much
in
the
way
of
balance
here
perhaps
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
this
one
but
it
escapes
me
at
the
moment
bottle
poured
a
deep
cloudy

beer
with
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
almost
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
deep
sweet
malt
with
some
dry
raisins
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sweet
malt
with
notes
of
dry
figs
and
raisins
although
taste
is
very
sweet
it
avoid
being
cloying
no
discernable
alcohol
even
thought
abv
is
quite
significant
with
a
full
body
with
limited
filtration
and
some
low
carbonation
very
well
done
and
definitely
something
i
would
want
to
try
again
thanks
again

enjoyable
nightcap
i
think
this

has
already
peaked
and
will
not
go
too
much
longer
still
a
nice
after
dinner
treat
not
that
i
would
ever
be
classy
enough
to
do
this
but
this
would
make
the
perfect
beer
for
a
reduction
into
a
marinade
for
some
red
meat
im
imagining
venison
stewed
in
a
couple
bottles
of
this
for
a
couple
days
and
wishing
i
had
the
kind
of
money
to
drop
on
a
meal
like
that
the
most
interesting
aspect
of
this
beer
was
the
nose
a
weird
yet
interesting
mix
of
aromas
especially
the
bleu
cheese
notes
that
reminded
me
that
i
have
a
small
chunk
of
bleu
d
auvergne
in
the
fridge
and
oddly
enough
the
pairing
works
quite
well
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
tough
to
find
outside
of
the
brewery
when
they
have
it
if
you
find
it
buy
all
that
is
available
i
did
on

at
the
brewpub

as

this
beer
was
a
hazy
deep
amber
colour
with
a
bit
of
a
reddish
hue
the
short
offwhite
head
showed
great
retention
and
left
sheets
of
fine
lace
on
the
glass
complex
aroma
with
a
mixture
of
bubblegum
orange
banana
and
floral
hops
alcohol
became
evident
as
it
warmed
the
huge
sweetness
assaults
the
palate
but
other
flavours
help
bring
this
into
perspective
the
bubblegum
orange
and
banana
character
appeared
again
but
this
was
supplemented
by
pineapple
and
lots
of
citrus
at
the
midpoint
this
created
an
intensely
complex
fruit
character
low
bitterness
overall
with
mild
alcohol
and
a
lingering
sweet
finish
heavy
body
that
was
on
the
syrupy
side
but
didnt
become
overbearing
the
carbonation
was
wellintegrated
and
refined
i
was
surprised
at
how
well
the
alcohol
content
was
masked
in
the
flavour
but
this
stuff
really
messes
you
up
fast
an
exceptional
winter
beer
i
highly
recommend
it

a

an
uneven
layer
of

not
unexpected
for
the
style
and
average
lacing
for
this

is
actually
impressive

in

upfront
with
the
bubblegum
carrying
in
here
as
well

vinous
tart
close
and
subtle

is
the
only
indication

for

big

at

are
released

this
warmed
some
notes
of
toffee
and
light
maple
syrup
are
noted
as
well
the
flavor
is
equally
big
in
fruits
mainly
of
the
dark
variety
some
molasses
and
caramel
very
rich
malty
flavor
that
hides
the
alcohol
extremely
well
the
sweetness
manages
to
keep
from
being
cloying
as
well
this
stuff
is
very
thick
with
a
big
warming
quality
to
it
right
after
the
first
sip
you
know
this
was
strong
stuff
with
the
way
the
warming
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
too
in
my
opinion
i
would
have
liked
more
than
one
bottle
even
though
it
took
me
awhile
to
finish
this
is
just
an
ideal
beer
to
be
sipping
on
in
the
cold
months

anytime

that

drinkability
is
good
for
this
interesting
concoction
but
not
amazing
this
is
some
damn
fine
nectar
on
its
first
birthday
but
i
can
only
assume
that
it
was
all
too
brash
in
its
youth
not
a
world
class
champion
like
the
raspberry
eisbock
but
a
good
german

eisbock
all
the

however
i
must
say
that
southamptons

simply
demolishes
this

not

from

much

to

flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a

of
toffee
and
molasses
notes
as
well
as
a
good
bit
of
dark
fruit
such
as
cherries
and
figs
the
alcohol
is
also
quite
present
medium

aroma
of
cherries
tart
vinous
oak
spices
taste
woody
sourness
red
wine
dark
fruit
cherries
not
a
typical
eisbock
but
nice
overall
crazy
like
all
bfm
beers
no
gusher
here
and
thats
a
good
thing
this
is
good
enough
to
be
unhappy
if
any
was
lost
not
the
most
alcoholic
sweet
filling
eisbock
but
a
very
good
beer
to
have
there
is
impressive
weight
and
heft
of
alcohol
to
this
and
it
plays
with
it
well
enough
the
sharpness
precludes
it
from
being
anything
else
but
a
sipper
but
when
you
do
sip
and
savour
this
it
has
stacks
to
show
off
overall
impression
this
is
a
well
designed
dark
ice
process
big
lager
eisbock
very
judicious
selection
of
hops
and
malts
along
with
care
and
control
in
the
brewing
aging
and
ice
process
has
yielded
a
really
unique
vinouslike
bock
if
you
didnt
know
what
you
were
drinking
youd
swear
it
was
a
rich
fortified
wine
of
immense
gustatory
sensation
i
love
bock
i
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
this
i
have
had
a
lot
of
high
gravity
doppel
bocks
but
this
is
a
new
experience
very
much
like
one
of
the
intense
beers
brew
dog
were
experimenting
with
but
easier
drinking
if
there
is
a
drawback
it
is
that
the
alcohol
is
a
tad
evident
now
for
some
palates
but
a
few
monthyears
in
the
cellar
will
certainly
improve
this
eisbock
i
will
be
buying
a
few
bottles
to
cellar
because
im
deeply
curious
to
see
what
bottle
aging
will
produce
if
they
last
that
long
the
newest
offering
from
neil
over
at
strangeways
murky
brown
coloring
very
light
on
the
palate
for
an
eisbock
flavor
is
nice
dry
fruits
some
malty
sweetness
the
alcohol
comes
through
somewhat
but
for
10
this
beer
goes
down
remarkably
easy
overall
not
a
bad
offering
from
strangeways
this
beer
is
not
overly
impressive
but
well
done
and
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
that
becomes
even
better
as
it
warms
up
d
a
solid
eisbock
thats
lower
in
alcohol
than
i
expected
if
youre
in
europe
and
you
dig
this
sort
of
style
this
might
be
worth
seeking
out
but
its
not
something
for
which
you
should
set
up
an
international
trade
that
being
said
i
was
sad
we
didnt
have
more
of
it
to
share
nice
and
dark
amber
with
a
slight
mocha
head
nose
of
apple
pie
and
straw
with
a
nice
hint
of
chocolate
this
is
carried
over
into
the
palate
nicely
with
a
unnoticeable
abv
and
a
nice
american
brown
ale
malting
character
but
with
a
completely
mellowed
lager
feel
and
a
nice
ester
quality
that
didnt
come
out
syrupy
but
almost
velvety
some
coconut
hints
a
very
easy
drink
a
really
nice
beer
and
different
from
what
i
expected
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
they
changed
the
recipe
as
i
got
none
of
the
sweetness
that
is
in
reviews
from
last
year
and
before
overall
i
can
certainly
see
why
this
one
wins
awards
quite
regularly
a
great
strong
bock
that
would
be
perfect
for
the
winter
months
i
think
the
palate
could
be
beefed
up
a
little
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
world
class
brew
in
the
style
im
glad
i
found
one
of
these
all
the
way
into
june
will
try
to
get
some
more
for
the
winter
months
next
bock
season
recommended
pleasantly
hoppy
and
surprisingly
dry
rather
belgian
in
character
but
with
more
of
an
emphasis
on
hops
than
on
yeast
autumn
leaves
tobacco
grape
must
and
clove
provide
an
earthy
foundation
to
bright
vaguely
tropical
heavily
floral
and
citric
bursts
of
hop
bitterness
some
sassafras
and
chicory
sound
off
as
well
almost
refreshing
but
also
a
bit
funky
probably
a
good
cheese
beer
overall
great
beer
this
is
much
more
than
just
a
bock
overall
what
a
beer
very
nice
perfectly
in
balance
a
real
treat
what
an
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
i
just
happen
to
see
a
single
bottle
of
this
sitting
on
the
shelf
of
my
local
liquor
store
and
thought
what
the
hell
im
glad
i
did
probably
the
best
dutch
beer
i
have
tasted
and
can
easily
hold
its
own
against
the
top
of
the
belgian
range
overheard
an
other
american
at
the
bar
describe
this
beer
as
mind
blowing
and
i
cant
say
he
was
too
far
off
with
the
description
taste
is
malty
with
chocolatemalt
and
coffee
notes
a
medium
maltbitterness
of
the
roasted
malts
adds
a
nice
depth
to
the
beer
together
with
the
probably
bottom
fermented
yeast
it
gives
this
typical
german
touch
to
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
lingering
maltbitter
the
alcohol
is
warming
a
beer
for
cold
winternights
moderately
full
mothfeel
but
enough
carbonation
on
the
tongue
and
bitterness
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
all
in
all
a
nice
winter
warmer
indeed
nice
lightbrown
head
staying
well
and
a
dark

nose
is
great
combination
of
sweet
caramellic
malts
and
yeasty
blackcherrieberryfruitesters
furter
giving
almond
and
a
hint
of

all
together
very

taste
is
full

also
but
also
giving
chocolateroast
moderate
sweetness
before
going
into
nice
bitterness
alcohol
well
hidden
and
a
very
good
balanced
brew
alltogether
good
carbonisation
makes
mouthfeel
good
and
very
good
drinkability
for
a
winterwarmer
maybe
even
litle
too
easy
overall
unlike
any
eisbock
ive
previously
encountered
in
that
its
totally
lacking
all
the
rich
complex
maltiness
and
potent
pleasing
flavors
one
would
expect
and
hope
for
if
this
is
the
concentrated
postfreezing
results
id
be
curious
to
see
what
the
heck
they
started
with
od
not
too
shabby
not
overwhelmingly
good
but
good
enough
to
keep
your
attention
d
very
sweet
and
slick
with
a
booze
burn
makes
this
delicious
beer
a
sipper
d
pretty
good
stuff
not
great
the
wellhidden
abv
is
commendable
a
rich
colour
with
a
strong
reddish
hue
very
little
carbonation
taste
is
non
aggresive
and
pleasant
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
overtone
and
some
caramel
notes
not
too
complicated
but
a
pleasant
experience
overall
goes
down
quite
easily
in
part
because
of
the
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
fairly
interesting
but
doesnt
quite
have
the
depth
and
complexity
i
usually
expect
in
an
eisbock
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
lightly
oily
feeling
medium
carbonation
some
alcohol
burn
going
down
overall
not
bad
but
pretty
plain
pours
a
mahogany
colour
with
a
tick
tan
head
but
quickly
dissipates
without
too
much
lacing
smells
of
raisins
and
caramel
the
taste
is
a
bit
subdued
of
raisins
brown
sugar
and
spices
a
little
bit
thin
in
the
body
but
still
quite
smooth
very
drinkable
and
nice
but
not
outstanding
i
barely
notice
any
alcohol
an
interesting
highoctane
brew
definitely
more
suited
for
a
cold
winters
night
for
a
9
5
abv
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
and
a
good
first
introduction
for
me
to
the
eisbock
style
not
sure
this
is
my
type
of
beer
too
much
alcohol
imo
to
sip
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
regardless
of
style
or
abv
but
for
an
eisbock
that
approaches
10
it
doesnt
get
much
more
drinkable
than
this
in
fact
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
truly
excels
this
is
a
seriously
vinous
eisbock
not
sure
how
long
it
was
cellared
the
shows
almost
belgian
notes
in
the
finish
with
some
chocolate
like
bakers
chocolate
in
the
midbody
a
very
refined
and
large
eisbock
with
almost
no
sweetness
left
in
the
beer
a
great
beer
from
quebec
they
have
changed
the
label
on
this
told
to
serve
at
50
degrees
plus
what
happened
to
celsius
pours
a
dark
thicker
looking
brown
above
average
mouthfeel
above
average
carbonation
and
in
the
taste
good
chocolate
and
malting
the
alcohol
is
there
though
not
extreme
some
raisin
anise
is
good
though
i
got
this
fresh
from
metro
joanette
it
has
a
few
months
bottling
on
it
and
sweetness
is
not
too
much
refreshing
and
satisfying
new
label
and
name
but
same
beer
pours
a
deep
mahogany
colour
showing
lots
of
ruby
when
held
up
to
the
light
what
head
there
is
dies
within
a
couple
of
minutes
and
the
liquid
looks
still
and
heavy
strong
treacle
and
caramel
aromas
assault
the
senses
sweet
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruits
dance
a
sublime
waltz
of
flavour
in
this
well
crafted
eisbock
heavy
feel
of
liquid
caramel
and
little
carbonation
make
this
hearty
drinking
and
despite
the
abv
the
alcohol
is
mia
nice
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
i
expected
but
i
doubt
ill
go
for
it
again

could

detect
some

which
i
am
sure
would
have
been
great
had
they
not
been
dominated
by
the

and
the

its
a
very

too

there
isnt
a

easy
to
take
considering

a
nice
strong
beer
to
turn
to
on
a
cool
day
pleasant
as
eisbocks
go
this
is
very
drinkable
not
overly
complex
but
has
a
character
like
a
very
mellow
malty
tripple
bock
with
just
enough
herbal
hopping
to
offset
the
big
malts
and
keep
sweetness

i
find
the
beer
to
be
less
syrupy
then
other
eisbocks
that
i
have
tried
but
it
clearly
follows
the
style
medium
in

light
in
carbonation
has
a
moderate
malt
richness
but
makes
up
for
it
in
creamy
flavors
of
vanilla

chocolate
that
make
it
a
trip
for
a
hot
sundae
surprisingly
also
not
much
banana
which
would
be
right
sometimes
to
style
as
with
some
doppels
ive
had
but
this
one
eschews
that

makes

overall
great
eisbock
this
may
be
my
very
first
one
but
not
my
last
overall
a
superb
eisbock
very
rich
and
flavorful
could
only
really
drink
one
in
a
sitting
though
o
the
originators
of
certain
styles
always
seem
to
maintain
their
beers
status
through
the
ages
especially
when
it
comes
to
german
breweries
and
kulmbacher
eisbock
the
original
eisbock
is
no
exception
this
heavily
malty
beer
pulls
off
a
big
beer
with
little
awareness
that
its
a
big
beer
the
alcohol
level
just
over
9
slips
by
almost
unnoticed
as
does
the
fullness
of
the
beer
due
to
its
complex
but
relaxed
profile
of
dark
fruit
caramel
sweetness
and
bready
malt
kulmbacher
is
a
beer
that
effortlessly
warms
the
bones
on
a
cold
winter
day
pours
very
dark
end
of
the
srm
scale
not
much
of
a

aroma
is
definitely
maltysweetness
caramel
on
initial
taste
very
cold
temp
attributed
to
medhigh
spikey
carbonation
feel
in
the
mouth
as
i
let
it
warm
to
room
temp
the
carb
dropped
and
viscosity
became
thicker
left
very
little
lace
hops
are
absent
on
aroma
and
taste
high
alcohol
in
taste
and
afterwards
left
a
very
warming
effect
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
eisbocks
but
this
one
will
be
worth
another
purchase
in
the
future
one
in
a
session
is
good
enough
based
on
the
high
abv
this
one
was
tried
without
any
feeling
or
prior
knowledge
about
the
beer
and
i
was
glad
i
ordered
it
real
nice
brew
six
pack
easily
in
one
sitting
o
really
nice
eisbock
big
malty
notes
as
youd
expect
well
balanced
with
no

and

the

a
delicious

2
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
style
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
really
intense
and
concentrated
a
great
experience
but
to
drink
more
than
one
without
fatigue
would
be
awfully
tough
o
wanted
the
schneider
aventinus
weizeneisbock
but
they
didnt
have
it
i
settled
for
this
but
ended
up
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
complex
brew
overall
its
a
pretty
flavorful
ice
house
kind
of
beer
but
not
really
something
i
would
seek
out
again
guess
i
am
more
of
a
fan
of
doppelbocks
one
of
the
more
complex
and
interesting
beers
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
the
eisbock
was
dark
and
rich
with
the
obvious
presence
of
the
9
2
alcohol
definitely
a
little
sweetness
plenty
of
roasty
flavor
caramel
and
germanic
beer
fruit
notes
wonderfully
balanced
and
very
drinkable
in
spite
of
the
heavy
nature
of
the
beer
im
hardpressed
to
notice
a
big
difference
between
this
eisbock
and
some
of
those
big
bold
doppelbocks
i
also
love
and
crave
and
this
is
a
good
thing
this
eisbock
is
big
and
bold
in
flavor
and
character
and
for
a
high
abv
beer
does
a
supremely
excellent
job
of
balancing
things
out
most
definitely
a
good
beer
for
a
cold
late
spring
winter
storm
while
the
hardwood
fire
burns
in
the
fireplace
and
i
can
easily
think
of
other
occasions
where
i
would
enjoy
this
powerhouse
beer
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
strong
but
balanced
if
a
little
malty
and
sweet
this
is
smooth
with
a
mediumfull
body
it
has
a
subtle
carbonation
that
massages
your
tongue
m
pleasant
smooth
malt
roll
however
a
few
notches
more
dry
in
the
finish
than
desirable
ends
up
being
much
more
drinkable
for
it
though
mild
bitterness
seems
to
distract
from
silky
bliss
more
body
at
least
would
be
nice
o
having
never
had
an
eisbock
before
i
went
in
expecting
this
to
be
very
sweet
boozy
and
sticky
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
toastiness
incredibly
drinkable
for
the
abv
as
well
pours
a

this
is

worth
it
a
2
50
buzz
struggling
to
find
critical
words
for
this
beer
cheap
surprisingly
agreeable
and
fun
o
goodish
beer
mediocre
eisbock
i
would
not
have
again
and
would
recommend
the
aventinus
eisbock
in
its
stead
o
im
not
sure
i
could
handle
a
sixpack
of
these
a
flavorful
alcoholic
bock
that
goes
down
like
water
id
be
ruined
in
a
halfhour
hell
i
couldnt
even
keep
this
one
in
my
glass
for
more
than
10
minutes
and
i
was
consciously
trying
to
sip
it
the
sign
of
great
beer
d
some
tasty
lager
from
germany
im
sort
of
a
sucker
for
eisbocks
cause
of
all
the
flavor
so
many
directions
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
the
aftertaste
keeps
the
sweet
malty
thing
going
with
a
little
bit
of
rauch
roasty
smoke
i
like
it
and
would
like
to
drink
it
again
actually
i
intend
to
try
others
of
this
style
this
is
easier
drinking
than
most
double
bocks
and
such
cheers
my
sample
was
the
kulmbacher
eisbock
version
same
abv
9
2
so
i
assume
this
is
a
legitimate
version
of
the
reichelbrau
my
experience
with
eisbock
must
be
in
relation
to
doublebock
since
that
is
what
i
know
this
beer
is
excellent
clean
taste
and
really
a
bud
tickler
not
too
much
of
anything
like
carbonation
molasses
flavor
or
hidden
spice
and
all
within
the
beer
itself
no
overwhelming
factors
that
is
such
a
tricky
thing
to
pull
off
so
many
of
us
are
ready
to
pounce
on
boring
but
believe
me
this
beer
is
not
boring
and
well
worth
a
good
try
if
of
course
you
are
favoribly
disposed
to
doublebocks
they
are
definitively
german
after
all
so
not
for
the
less
than
bold
taste
buds
but
if
you
like
a
nice
crisp
bock
on
the
higher
alcohol
level
this
is
a
solid
yes
recommendation
this
beer
is
unique
and
delicious
overall
this
brew
was
worth
the
wait
it
has
aged
quite
well
and
possesses
some
wine
like
qualities
i
have
only
had
a
couple
samples
of
this
style
and
so
far
i
am
totally
impressed
this
is
a
medium
to
fuller
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
for
being
16
years
old
this
brew
is
seemingly
timeless
i
have
picked
up
on
more
signs
of
oxidation
and
age
in
beers
that
are
only
14
as
old
as
this
one
this
is
a
fantastic
display
of
a
beer
that
can
last
the
test
of
time
if
cellared
properly
fantastic
stuff
now
to
get
a
brand
spanking
new
bottle
to
have
as
comparison
o
outstanding
wish
id
gotten
the
sixer
instead
of
just
one
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
off
tan
small
head
aroma
dark
caramel
and
roasted
malt
as
well
as
in
the
taste
some
nice
dark
fruits
plum
dates
figs
as
well
rounding
out
the
taste
smooth
going
down
and
great
carbination
the
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
a
really
great
beer
poured
into
a
brandy
snifter
pours
dark
caramel
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
and
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
in
the
glass
the
head
dissipates
moderately
quickly
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
there
are
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
chocolate
and
alcohol
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
very
well
there
are
dark
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
chocolate
and
the
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
it
has
a
nice
sweet
flavor
along
with
some
back
end
bitterness
the
body
is
light
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
the
beer
is
a
sipper
with
good
alcohol
warmness
but
it
is
very
easy
to
gulp
this
flavorful
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
recommend
trying
i
agree
with
a
previous
reviewer
that
this
beer
has
the
complexity
of
a
solid
belgian
quad
with
the
qualities
of
a
solid
lager
germany
has
been
going
through
a
beer
deevolution
however
not
in
this
case
the
kulmbach
brewers
hit
this
ball
out
of
the
atmosphere
in
every
way
this
beer
was
the
best
thing
i
have
ever
drank
and
edged
out
a
robert
mondavi
cab
worth
over
300
and
30
year
old
highland
park
which
are
my
second
and
third
respectively
i
often
fantasize
about
taking
a
trip
to
germany
just
for
this
beverage
because
for
my
taste
buds
this
beer
was
rapturous
and
cathartic
overall
still
boozy
and
rough
but
in
the
most
glorious
way
possible
t
raisin
dark
malt
rye
dark
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
peat
on
the
finish
alcohol
is
a
bit
evident
but
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
super
drinkable
this
beer
was
freaking
amazing
smell
was
old
malty
woody
smoky
malt
taste
was
unexpectedly
dry
very
little
sweetness
for
such
a
strong
dark
beer
woody
smoky
flavour
was
still
there
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
was
present
seemingly
all
from
roasted
malt
i
didnt
taste
any
hop
flavour
thank
god
very
thin
and
refreshing
yet
the
alcohol
was
still
very
well
disguised
not
sure
how
with
such
moderate
bitterness
and
low
sweetness
this
is
simply
an
amazing
beer
the
only
eisbock
ive
ever
had
so
not
sure
how
it
compares
to
others
but
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
o
solid
a
nice
change
of
pace
o
wow
ive
never
had
an
eisbock
but
this
is
spectacular
at
least
by
the
smell
and
taste
i
liked
the
appearance
as
well
slightly
unique
to
me
with
the
lacing
doing
what
it
did
of
course
i
would
have
this
again
and
am
really
intrigued
by
eisbocks
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
toffee
and
molasses
with
some
raisin
the
taste
was
a
mix
of
fruity
flavors
some
raisin
fig
flavors
it
had
the
complexity
of
some
belgian
quads
with
the
drinkability
of
a
good
lager
this
was
my
first
of
this
style
and
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
brown
with
dark
ruby
tones
under
the
light
theres
no
head
or
lace
its
aroma
is
of
dark
cherries
with
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
with
cherry
cough
syrup
dates
and

the

is

drinkable

may
be

great
taste
as
it
should
in
a
bock
this
is
so
smooth
but
malt
sure
has
its
place
too
the
flavor
is
so
clear
and
crisp
that
it
presents
itself
distinctly
and
concisely
put
it
in
a
milkshake
and
youd
have
an
old
fashioned
malted
with
awesome
flavors
you
just
want
another
bottle
after
its
done

this
one
is
a
big
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
with
some
kicks
of
warming
alcohol
from
time
to
time
there
is
a
huge
backbone
of
sweet
malts
accompanied
by
some
fruit
flavors
spices
are
mild
and
nuttiness
that
i
get
from
the
german
dbocks
improves
as
the
beer
warms
up

of
alcohol

it
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
years
as
soon
as
i
cracked
open
the
cap
i
could
smell
the
current
fragrance
with
a
hint
of
maybe
dates
or
figs
it
poured
a
nice
almost
deep
ruby
brown
as
far
as
the

heavy
flavor
of

beer

can
age
or
more
than
6
years
and
still
taste

malty

marzipan

rich
deep
and
warming
o
exceptionally
smooth
and
delicious
beer
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
night
this
is
actually
my
first
eisbock
style
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
will
most
definitely
be
trying
others
o
a
solid
brew
loads
of
flavour
as
deceivingly
smooth
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
flavour
profile
is
quite
complementary
definitely
worth
picking
up
and
super
glad
i
was
able
to
take
it
for
a
spin
o
everything
is
very
concentrated
and
is
unapologetically
malt
forward
i
have
never
had
the
regular
341
ml
bottles
but
this
special
edition
bomber
is
a
great
sipper
that
will
be
an
excellent
brew
to
cellar
worth
picking
up
a
few
if
you
can
still
find
them
prost
lampertland
overall
an
average
offering
some
good
components
but
doesnt
quite
add
up
a
solid
example
of
an
obscure
style
from
a
brewery
i
didnt
know
existed
until
recently
im
pretty
stoked
that
im
still
unaware
of
gems
like
this
from
my
own
backyard
cheers

for
increasing

this
is
a
beer
that
could
really
sneak
up
on
you
o
overall
solid

nicely
made
and
very
drinkable
the
fruitiness
makes
the

very
tolerable
o
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
eisbock
the
best
i
have
had
of
this
style
so
far
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
balanced
beer
at
9
5
very
easy
drinking
i
would
buy
again
but
i
think
this
was
a
seasonal
drinkability
given
its
high
alcohol
this
is
actually
light
enough
to
enjoy
a
second
bottle
in
an
evening
fresh
2010
bottle
pours
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
quicky
fades

aroma
is
mild
but
sweet
the
taste
is
very
chocolately
with
sweet
malts
molasses
and
light
fruitiness
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
good
drinkability
even
though
its
a
little
bit
too
sweet
the
alcohol
in
this
is
very
well
hidden
not
a
deep
and
contemplative
beer
just
good
tasting
and
strong
if
you
need
to
warm
up
on
a
cold
vancouver
night
this
one
does
the
trick
very
well
lightmedium
spoton
carbonation
perhaps
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
for
the
style
not
perhaps
as
bold
or
as
layered
as
others
in
the
category
but
with
a
little
age
this
beer
really
shines
as
a
smooth
drinkable
eisbock
thanks
dave
thanks
to
canucklehead
for
the
bottle
d
very
sweet
and
thick
thanks
seldom
seen
i
think
this
bottle
was
aged
as
much
as
two
years
and
that
was
a
good
thing
poured
black
with
little
head
to
speak
of
that
meant
understated
carbonation
there
was
a
tad
of
lace
delicious
rich
malty
and
that
was
in
the
aroma
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
roast
more
imperial
porter
with
above
average
mouthfeel
than
the
hoppy
versions
from
a
brewer
in
niagara
falls
of
the
same
style
drinkability
is
pretty
good
decent
balance
a

glad
i
finally
could
nice
beer
ive
been
trying
to
track
this
down
for
years
but
they
tend
to
be
sold
out
by
christmas
so
a
big
thanks
to
seldomseen
for
this
trade
at
9

this
beer
is
not
to
be
taken
lightly
the
effects
are
quite
noticeable
after
one
beer
overall
unfortunately
in
my
college
days
i
drank
this
stuff
to
get
smashed
at
christmas
parties
i
enjoy
it
more
now
for
its
complexity
and
rich
character
great
stuff
definitely
not
a
daily
drinker
but
a
great
christmas
treatodd
i
say
this
in
june
bottle
courtesy
of
mgermani
poured
a
deep
cloudy
brown
color
bock
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
almost
no
carbonation
aroma
of
dry
fruits
figs
and
plums
with
some
toffee
malt
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
malt
with
great
notes
of
dry
fruits
such
as
figs
and
raisins
body
is
full
with
some
light
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
really
appreciated
that
one
except
maybe
for
being
a
bit
too
sweet
and
rich
overall
a
good
winter
beer
and
a
good
strong
dark
beer
would
buy
again
if
available
aaa
one
of
canadas
better
eisbocks
but
needs
work
do
something
with
the
heading
on
this
brew
and
youll
be
there

best
of
the
recent
beer
club
wow
what
a
treat
this
was
brought
to
our
beer
tasting
club
by
one
of
our
resident
canadians
shed
been
talking
about
it
for
ages
so
we
finally
got
a
chance
to
see
if
it
lived
up
to
its
name
preview
it
did
poured
super
dark
crimson
and
clear
with
a
tan
colored
head
looks
great
smells
plummy
and
ethyl
alcohollike
and
fairly
inviting
taste
is
sweet
caramel
with
some
chocolate
flavor
alcohol
really
quite
understated
smoe
roastiness
and
dark
fruity
flavors
like
dates
and
prunes
a
thick
coughsyrup
and
water
texture
thats
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
probably
the
best
eisbock
ive
had
pours
as
deep
an
amber
color
as
ive
ever
seen
its
like
an
incredibly
infused
tea
color
a
2
finger
head
falls
to
absolutely
no
head
over
top
the
nose
is
rich
toasted
melanoidan
munich
malt
with
a
thick
caramel
sweetness
hanging
over
top
of
it
i
think
these
two
aromas
are
strong
enough
to
keep
any
fruity
fig
notes
from
coming
through
flavor
is
strong
but
not
as
bold
as
i
was
expecting
the
initial
sip
brings
a
thick
caramel
that
sits
over
a
deep
toastyness
this
moves
towards
a
very
deep
caramelized
prune
and
fig
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
fading
quickly
feel
is
thick
with
a
light
carbonation
very
filling
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
the
bottle
says
its
9
5
id
expect
a
touch
more
alcohol
in
an
eisbock
but
im
feeling
it
a
little
in
my
cheeks
this
is
one
to
find
if
you
happen
to
be
in
b
c
on
vancouver
island
nice
i
love
the
new
6
pack
with
smaller
bottles
as
it
makes
easier
to
drink
one
without
the
alcohol
9

abv
taking
effect
this
is
an
improvement
on
last
years
beer
as
that
sweetness
has
been
decreased
and
the
smoothness
has
been
increased
lots
of
nice
cakey
flavours
and
a
malty
finish
that
makes
the
alcohol
hide
its
face
very
drinkable
and
very
refined
this
one
is
sold
exclusively
in
650ml
bottles
with
a
foil
based
labels
which
have
a
tendency
to
peel
back
while
still
on
store
shelves
its
a
great
little
beer
that
wont
last
long
get
it
while
you
can
smooth
strong
coffee
coco
taste
great
mouth
feel
with
a
creamy
smooth
finish
holy
shit
suprise
the
first
of
its
kind
to
have
such
definition
it
may
be
that
my
palate
has
been
excericed
by
two
bottles
of
jolly
pumpkin
but
this
beer
has
so
much
dimensions
its
unbelievable
pour
is
a
deduced
hef
head
isnt
as
big
doesnt
last
as
long
nose
is
a
mess
of
things
toast
smoke
molasses
and
earthy
minerals
in
a
lace
of
digestive
notes
licorice
and
banana
equally
fused
palate
is
rich
and
lean
and
a
touch
of
dough
a
molasses
hef
and
astringent
notes
of
mineral
and
acidic
fruit
hints
dark
fruit
tart
black
berry
and
dry
maple
syrup
bread
finish
of
banana
too
dry
to
be
associated
to
banana
bread
too
roasted
yet
it
still
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
its
a
big
brew
with
a
lot
of
undertones
the
best
american
eisbock
ive
had
wheat
rich
but
not
dominating
o
not
so
much
i
thought
this
one
was
ok
but
not
anything
mind
blowing
the
combo
of
strong
flavors
and
11
abv
really
make
this
one
hard
to
drink
the
taste
is
fruity
and
earthy
w
some
mild
toasted
grain
and
vegetal
notes
with
a
lot
of
wheat
cererallike
flavorsfrom
the
dark
wheat
and
mild
fruity
almost
prunelike
element
with
a
light
date
and
dark
brown
sugar
quality
the
eisbock
finishes
with
a
warming
dry
finish
a
pretty
high
drinkability
score
for
an
11
beer
but
is
is
not
to
be
taken
lightly
the
eisbock
has
a
smooth
quality
that
makes
you
forget
about
how
strong
it
is
until
halfway
through
not
one
i
recommend
having
more
than
1
of
i
sipped
on
this
for
a
while
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
damn
good
despite
the
abv
ok
since
i
am
lazy
ill
just
direct
you
to
please
read
my
glowing
review
of
ramstein
winter
wheat
then
multiply
that
times
ten
despite
pouring
with
very
little
head
modest
retention
and
decent
lace
if
you
close
your
eyes
the
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
mixed
with
modest
alcohol
essence
will
have
you
thinking
that
youre
smelling
a
russian
imp
stout
the
taste
also
revealed
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
caramel
but
the
chocolate
and
roastiness
dominates
and
the
finish
on
this
beer
i
found
to
be
slightly
dryer
than
the
winter
wheat
again
the
alcohol
is
definitely
more
noticeable
in
this
offering
and
expectedly
so
but
it
blends
well
with
the
dark
fruitchocolatemalty
balance
thick
and
smooth
on
the
palate
once
again
another
dangerously
drinkable
offering
by
this
brewery
give
someone
your
car
keys
when
drinking
this
d
not
really
nice
flavors
but
it
just
dont
quite
come
together
poured
a
dark
brown
pretty
hazy
and
opaque
head
didnt
last
long
but
left
a
few
trails
of
bubbles
here
and
there
my
initial
thought
was
that
is
was
slightly
reminiscent
of
aventinus
which
is
confirmed
that
its
basically
a
weizenbock
with
the
ice
distillation
wheaty
twang
with
lots
of
plum
raisins
and
caramel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
only
shows
as
a
warmth
in
the
throat
wonderfully
chewy
and
raisiny
banana
and
clove
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
a
woody
earthiness
how
strange
is
this
oak
aged
regardless
it
is
a
complex
flavorful
malt
bomb
on
your
palate
and
everyone
needs
to
try
this
at
least
once
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
but
the
low
carbonation
does
detract
from
it
somewhat
not
quite
as
much
depth
and
complexity
as
in
some
eisbocks
but
still
pretty
tasty
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
pretty
smooth
for
the
abv
just
a
bit
of
warmth
just
lacking
the
complexity
i
hoped
for
but
still
really
nice
stuff
thanks
alan
d
wow
amazing
no
hint
of
the
abv
at
all
probably
the
best
eisbock
i
have
ever
had
would
love
to
try
the
rasberry
one
side
by
side
with
this
one
since
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
it
way
to
easy
to
drink
this
one
it
may
be
11
5
percent
but
id
never
guess
from
the
taste
i
nursed
my
way
through
a
16
oz
growler
that
i
shared
a
bit
of
with
the
mrs
and
if
i
had
a
32
we
would
be
on
our
faces
delicious
and
sneaky
stuff
pours
a
rich
ruby
brown
color
with
a
very
small
wisy
off
white
head
not
much
of
a
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruit
booze
soaked
cherries
and
raisins
followed
by
scents
of
clove
and
banana
nice
aroma
not
overly
strong
the
flavor
is
of
alcohol
vapors
clove
and
banana
followed
by
a
solid
roast
malt
flavor
it
seems
to
lack
a
depth
of
character
some
of
the
dark
fruit
pops
up
in
the
end
as
well
as
a
sour
cherry
note
a
moderate
body
with
very
soft
carbonation
finishes
with
a
sour
bitter
bite
though
i
did
get
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
this
eisbock
doesnt
taste
overly
boozy
or
cloying
it
could
use
some
more
clove
and
banana
flavors
but
the
flavors
that
are
there
are
good
12
ounce
hand
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
and
caramel
malt
with
some
alcohol
the
flavor
is
dark
fruit
alcohol
caramel
and
some
chocolate
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
d
excellent
drinkability
high
alcohol
and
insane
complexity
make
this
one
a
slow
sipper
nice
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
mostly
flat
the
carbonation
levels
do
seem
appropriate
though
and
match
the
flavor
profile
nicely
drinkability
is
high
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
closer
to
7
if
i
didnt
already
feel
the
strong
buzz
kicking
in
after
around
16
oz
or
so
this
is
definitely
a
solid
beer
and
one
that
i
would
like
to
drink
again
d
for
a
beer
thats
11
5
this
stuff
goes
down
like
nothing
easy
to
drink
and
very
bold
and
full
of
flavor
wish
this
stuff
was
more
widely
available
d
this
is
extremely
drinkable
stuff
i
was
worried
64oz
would
be
too
much
but
it
went
quickly
with
everyone
seeking
out
refills
its
not
quite
as
good
as
the
kuhnhenn
raspberry
eisbock
but
it
was
much
more
sessionable
as
much
as
any
eisbock
can
be
sessionable
i
suppose
worth
seeking
out
especially
as
proof
that
highgravity
germanstyle
beers
neednt
be
malt
bombs
d
11
5
for
real
this
is
crazy
good
and
the
alcohol
is
not
there
at
all
as
far
as
i
can
tell
until
i
finish
a
couple
of
glasses
at
least
d
scary
drinkable
you
know
the
booze
is
there
you
know
it
is
a
high
abv
beer
but
your
cant
help
yourself
with
this
great
beer
drinks
easy
for
the
style
abv
but
im
sure
this
one
would
reward
you
with
a
stellar
hangover
if
you
stayed
on
it
past
a
liter
of
it
beware
to
me
this
is
easily
the
most
eclectic
eisbock
ive
had
the
star
of
the
trade
so
far
i
bet
this
would
drink
so
great
by
a
fire
in
ski
country
went
down
a
treat
on
a
fairly
warm
night
in
the
nc
piedmont
expectations
were
high
i
stuffed
my
bag
with
growlersof
course
but
fuck
me
if
i
just
pass
up
their
great
winter
wheat
from
now
on
with
a
snobbish
meh
just
pester
for
this
throughout
the
year
oh
and
head
retention
and
lacing
are
superb
unreal
how
good
this
one
really
is
i
am
simply
floored
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
a
stunner
but
wow
i
would
want
this
one
on
tap
every
day
of
the
week
it
is
just
that
damn
good
big
thanks
to
mike
for
getting
me
this
soo
worth
it
d
well
the
verdict
is
out
and
this
stuff
is
topnotch
11
5
is
nothing
to
take
lightly
but
barkeep
can
i
get
another
dangerously
drinkable
i
will
look
forward
to
having
this
treat
whenever
possible
pours
black
with
a
brown
head
nose
is
molasses
raisins
alcohol
smoky
tone
flavor
is
boozy
yes
raisins
figs
soyish
tones
fight
over
that
and
clearly
show
watered
down
coffee
liquor
tones
are
there
too
overall
pretty
intense
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
carbonation
is
slightly
nibbling
but
overall
a
bit
subdued
this
is
a
nice
beer
due
to
the
style
rarity
i
suppose
i
wont
really
ever
have
the
kind
of
exposure
to
it
that
would
leave
me
highly
educated
but
this
certainly
doesnt
suck
just
be
prepared
for
a
unique
drinker
and
something
that
is
pretty
intense
mouthfeel
is
probably
a
hair
overcarbonated
just
a
bit
too
fizzy
medium
bodied
was
slightly
underwhelmed
by
this
one
which
is
surprising
given
the
amazing
rep
id
had
from
it
a
previous
growler
was
better
this
one
seems
past
its
prime
after
only
a
few
days
in
the
glass
i
was
fortunate
to
get
a
growler
of
this
from
the
brewery
poured
it
into
my
duvel
glass
and
the
color
was
very
dark
almost
black
has
the
aromas
sweet
malty
notes
hints
of
chocolate
maybe
caramel
the
taste
is
incredible
because
there
is
so
much
going
on
once
again
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
distinctive
malty
sweetness
possibly
hints
of
licorice
and
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
after
the
lingering
flavors
leave
your
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
like
a
beefed
up
winter
wheat
im
not
sure
how
much
i
could
drink
this
in
one
night
thankfully
i
split
the
growler
with
my
buddies
as
this
one
filled
me
up
rather
quickly
good
malt
taste
with
a
licorice
aftertaste
to
it
slightly
chocolate
despite
its
high
alcohol
content
its
a
nice
balance
that
goes
unnoticed
im
not
familiar
with
winter
wheats
but
this
was
quite
good
d
this
beer
rates
exceptional
for
this
category
because
the
aroma
and
taste
are
both
so
interesting
and
the
alcohol
though
11
5
is
almost
absent
so
drinkable
couldnt
be
better
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
skim
of
tan
foam
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
but
thats
to
be
expected
malty
caramelized
sugar
aroma
with
some
dried
fruit
and
vanilla
notes
toffee
flavour
up
front
with
some
raisin
and
alcohol
light
chocolate
and
vanilla
alcohol
showed
up
towards
the
end
and
there
was
a
hint
of
smoke
present
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
quite
good
and
very
drinkable
for
how
robust
it
is
by
the
way
the
official
name
of
this
beer
is
ramstein
ice
storm
eisbock
not
sure
if
it
was
changed
recently
or
not
an
outstanding
eisbock
complex
and
potent
yet
smooth
and
drinkable
a
wonderful
winter
wheat
ale
thanks
again
john
overall
im
a
fan
just
wish
we
could
get
more
of
it
cheers
mouthfeel
is
spicey
with
hints
of
the
fruit
and
chocolate
and
a
stickyness
that
seems
appropriate
with
this
concentrated
brew
poured
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
light
tan
quickly
dissapating
off
white
head
that
left
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
chocolate
nuts
bananas
roast
smoke
and
dried
fruits
chocolate
wheaty
taste
more
dried
fruits
with
lots
of
sweet
malts
in
the
taste
peppery
alcohol
very
nice
ruby
coke
brown
light
quickly
fading
head
strong
coffee
and
tobacco
aroma
very
dry
enough
that
it
creates
a
asheslike
aspect
gentle
woody
component
accompanies
dark
bitter
chocolate
cocoa
even
i
must
say
im
a
bit
shocked
at
the
almost
total
absence
of
any
fruit
hints
the
malt
is
there
most
definitely
big
thick
but
perhaps
a
little
too
dry
for
the
beer
to
deserve
its
praise
in
my
mind
focus
of
flavours
seems
to
be
geared
toward
coffee
cigar
and
roasted
chocolate
a
beany
aspect
also
gets
uncovered
after
a
few
sips
and
bring
up
a
vegetal
tone
that
i
could
live
without
medium
bodied
light
to
moderate
carbonation
level
lets
sum
it
up
by
saying
this
is
a
very
stoutish
eisbock
which
doesnt
wear
its
11
5
at
all
i
have
had
the
aventinus
recently
and
this
is
way
different
aroma
is
nearly
the
same
as
the
regular
winter
wheat
cloveychocolately
and
no
real
hint
of
alcohol
there
is
a
slight
and
lasting
head
that
is
nice
and
brown
the
color
is
pitch
black
now
the
fun
begins
flavor
is
smooth
and
creamy
almost
to
the
point
of
being
light
and
fluffy
chocolate
nmalt
flavors
dominate
over
the
alcohol
to
the
point
of
making
this
beer
deadly
where
the
aventinus
removes
enamel
this
satisfys
ones
thirst
for
beer
wonderfully
balanced
and
drinkable
perhaps
the
best
eisbock
that
i
have
ever
tried
thanks
again
to
yen157
and
vidaloca
extremely
dark
beer
and
very
thick
it
has
a
thick
head
which
isnt
huge
but
lingers
the
smell
is
somewhat
similar
to
many
wheats
with
the
presence
of
bananas
but
one
can
also
smell
the
presence
of
alcohol
the
taste
contains
the
banana
flavor
as
far
as
mouthfeel
is
concerned
it
is
thick
but
goes
down
smooth
this
is
very
drinkable
but
has
a
high
alcohol
content
so
a
few
of
these
might
have
you
feeling
it
the
body
is
full
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
very
rich
and
smooth
mouthfeel
it
is
nice
and
hearty
i
guess
you
could
say
chewy
roasty
flavors
are
huge
in
this
one
more
so
than
in
the
winter
wheat
the
toasted
wheat
flavors
are
also
in
tall
order
bits
of
chocolate
are
in
there
as
well
although
they
are
hidden
a
bit
in
the
mass
of
complexity
dark
fruits
meet
with
currants
and
hints
of
clove
in
the
finish
before
it
gets
nice
and
dry
for
the
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
toasted
and
lingers
for
a
bit
longer
than
you
want
to
wait
for
your
next
sip
the
alcohol
is
nearly
invisible
but
you
can
find
it
here
and
there
this
is
a
work
of
art
great
viscosity
carbonation
everything
damn
near
perfect
this
is
a
beer
perfectly
suited
for
a
nightcap
not
for
its
strength
but
because
of
its
finesse
and
elegance
backwash
after
a
few
false
starts
i
was
very
happy
to
get
my
hands
on
some
of
this
it
was
worth
the
effort
as
i
mentioned
this
just
became
available
and
the
kegs
were
heavily
carbonated
and
extracold
in
preparation
to
fill
growlers
so
more
impressions
are
likely
all
i
can
say
is
that
rarely
have
i
enjoyed
a
liquid
lunch
so
much
this
beer
is
the
essence
of
craftsmanship
if
you
get
a
chance
visit
the
brewery
and
youll
see
the
attention
lavished
on
all
of
their
products
like
the
brewdogs
tnp
before
it
this
has
much
going
for
it
in
terms
of
forging
new
vistas
yadda
yadda
yadda
and
is
a
definite
slow
sipper
but
suffers
a
bit
too
many
side
effects
from
all
that
consolidation
of
flavour
there
appears
to
be
good
reason
why
the
brown
spirits
craftsmen
of
the
world
go
about
it
the
way
that
they
do
as
opposed
to
this
one
interesting
in
a
circus
sideshow
gaping
appreciation
sort
of
way
if
thats
you
and
your
wallets
sort
of
thing
im
at
a
loss
for
words
its
just
that
awful
bottle
home
of
course
not
the
whole
bottle
the
bottle
looks
great
the
beer
in
the
glass
light
brown
no
head
complex
fieryalcoholic
aroma
starts
the
same
incredibly
strong
very
alcoholic
like
fire
on
the
tongue
goes
down
burning
like
an
earthquake
shows
interesting
fruity
notes
like
apricot
very
warming
but
also
well
balanced
finish
very
prickly
aftertaste
really
an
incredible
beer
a
hot
beer
well
done
record
d
i
liked
the
bottle
design
but
i
wasnt
as
impressed
by
the
contents
the
alcohol
content
sets
me
off
a
bit
you
have
to
take
your
time
with
this
beer
aromas
of
all
the
listed
spices
dont
get
much
vanilla
in
aroma
but
get
more
of
it
in
the
taste
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
for
an
eisbock
theres
no
hint
of
boozyness
whatsoever
which
i
prefer
smooth
and
quite
enjoyable
would
seek
this
out
again
next
season
o
the
various
spices
make
this
different
to
other
strong
eisbocks
in
no
way
sessionable
but
a
nice
cool
weather
sipping
beer
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
hitachino
can
often
sit
on
shelves
here
in
new
mexico
but
there
are
some
gems
among
their
brand
this
is
one
of
them
certainly
not
an
eisbock
in
the
traditional
sense
and
a
little
more
onenote
and
bitter
than
i
prefer
bottom
line
its
strong
and
pretty
good
overall
i
had
higher
hopes
based
on
my
first
sips
food
match
i
would
recommend
this
brew
after
that
big
traditional
christmas
dinner
but
before
or
with
that
traditional
christmas
pudding
pours
out
a
copper
orang
with
a
thin
frothy
offwhite
head
spicing
is
subtle
in
the
nose
i
get
mostly
citrusrelated
notes
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
i
also
pick
up
a
lot
of
caramel
reminds
me
of
a
winter
release
of
a
typical
biere
de
garde
flavor
is
loads
of
caramel
orange
bread
honey
lightly
toasted
grains
with
a
fairly
mild
yeast
character
cocoa
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
a
bit
sticky
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
it
reminds
me
of
some
french
bieres
de
garde
that
are
released
around
the
holidays
i
should
have
saved
this
for
thanksgiving
dinner
it
would
have
gone
perfectly
with
it
o
definitely
different
this
was
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
it
has
me
wanting
to
try
more
a
truly
unique
and
pretty
good
stronger
ale
a
lot
to
like
here
also
a
lot
of
loveitorhateit
spicing
personally
i
tend
towards
liking
this
ale
which
feels
most
like
a
belgian
saison
but
with
notable
asian
influence
spiced
beer
or
imperial
amber
christmas
ale
with
witbier
spices
what
is
this
mess
and
why
do
i
feel
like
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
fresh
example
pours
amber
orange
cloudy
with
a
light
layer
on
top
of
white
foam
orange
nose
with
a
wheat
back
slight
sour
some
citrus
taste
label
speaks
of
other
spices
but
all
i
get
is
orange
good
not
great
its
certainly
spicy
but
not
the
most
balanced
or
relaxing
brew
ive
ever
sampled
looks
alright
with
an
pleasantly
spicy
aroma
however
the
flavour
is
rather
harsh
and
dry
due
to
an
excess
of
spicing
not
much
fruitiness
to
speak
of
and
the
malt
takes
a
back
seat
subdued
hops
mostly
pine
body
is
satisfying
enough
despite
its
strength
the
malt
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
spice
regime
someone
chucked
a
rack
into
the
mash
if
you
ask
me
interesting
but
not
particularly
drinkable
no
need
to
hunt
it
down
o
quite
a
fantastic
blend
and
balance
of
all
the
flavors
nothing
stands
out
too
boldly
seems
to
have
that
signature
hitachino
flavor
at
its
core
dunno
how
they
do
it
but
their
ales
are
fantastic
o
awesome
wellbalanced
unique
flavor
and
refreshing
and
smooth
pours
a
nice
orange
amber
color
with
minimal
head
smell
is
very
sweet
and
fresh
taste
is
pretty
good
one
can
taste
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
along
with
faint
vanilla
bean
and
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
slight
spiciness
at
the
finish
and
the
8
ab
hits
you
pretty
good
a
very
good
refreshing
beer
hitachino
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
on
delivering
taste
on
this
one
without
saying
on
the
label
exactly
what
commemorative
ale
is
commemorating
the
ale
really
tries
hard
to
capture
the
taste
of
christmas
desserts
with
gingersnap
cookies
and
they
do
that
to
perfection
if
this
is
not
their
intent
then
they
are
way
off
target
d
this
was
a
nice
winter
warmer
with
delicate
and
complex
scent
and
taste
cant
be
too
cold
or
youll
miss
all
the
subtleties
the
body
was
great
and
the
finish
was
smooth
well
hidden
alcohol
too
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
would
be
really
interesting
to
age
but
still
nice
fresh
solid
brew
somehow
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
330ml
bottle
2011
version
this
one
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
there
was
almost
no
head
on
it
and
what
was
there
was
offwhite
this
one
has
a
really
nice
nose
definitely
spicy
with
coriander
at
the
top
of
the
list
a
bit
peppery
too
the
taste
very
good
peppery
and
coriander
notes
on
top
of
a
malty
brew
there
is
a
slight
tartness
and
bitterness
to
the
taste
definitely
some
fruity
notes
and
very
complex
a
really
nice
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
honey
and
slight
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
honey
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
smells
slightly
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
light
body
the
aftertaste
starts
with
a
soft
sugariness
but
quickly
overwhelmed
by
a
too
strong
spiciness
2010
version
pours
a
amber
to
brown
with
a
full
frothy
and
easily
two
finger
head
at
pour
cloudy
in
appearance
looks
hearty
head
disappates
over
time
not
much
lacing
smell
is
spices
and
orange
citrus
strong
orange
gives
it
alcohol
presence
even
on
the
nose
taste
is
semisweet
with
more
spice
presence
vanilla
and
coriander
orange
peel
is
present
and
gives
some
burn
on
the
back
of
the
throat
but
not
overpowering
cheers
overall
very
drinkable
spiced
beer
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
this
beer
and
the
brewery
ignite
an
expectation
of
greatness
that
is
not
executed
in
this
brew
the
expectation
of
greatness
almost
is
the
downfall
of
this
beer
itself
if
i
had
discovered
it
in
a
back
alley
id
want
in
engraved
on
my
epitaph
its
intriguing
texture
body
and
mouth
filling
properties
with
citrus
banana
dominican
republic
essence
session
potential
paired
with

seen
you
do

holiday
ale
overall
always
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
have
had
the
last
few
years
and
it
continues
to
ease
in
the
winter
season
great
mix
of

a

with
an

and
some

to
make
it
come

a

and
a

mouthfeel
with
a
dry
orange
citrus
hop
in
the
aftertaste
nice
hops
spice
and
mellow
malt
overall
a
very
nice
beer
for
this
style
and
ill
have
to
pick
up
more
from
this
brewery
o
this
beer
was
one
of
those
that
had
such
potential
but
kind
of
fell
short
it
is
worth
a
try
but
kind
of
unimpressive
o
although
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
from
the
taste
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
is
probably
better
off
as
one
to
be
sipped

a

of
great

that
have
nice

and
balance
high
c
o
a
nice
surprise
i
wasnt
sure
what
i
was
getting
into
with
this
one
and
it
was
really
good
the
9
0
abv
was
equally
surprising
i
didnt
notice
it
at
all
if
you
run
across
this
one
try
it
o
not
as
spicy
as
i
was
thinking
it
might
have
been
the
spices
are
more
subtle
and
that
improves
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
very
interesting
flavor
profile
but
slightly
lacking
in
the
nose
glad
that
i
tried
this
beer
which
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
to
be
fair
i
think
this
is
probably
a
good
well
made
beer
but
i
just
dont
like
it
at
all
its
got
some
spices
i
cant
identify
and
i
dont
care
because
ill
never
drink
this
beer
again
unless
its
all
i
have
i
have
had
a
lot
worse
beers
though
o
kiuchi
brewery
does
it
again
i
am
blown
away
by
this
ale
even
3
years
after
its
prime
the
only
problem
is
that
now
my
store
has
run
out
and
i
doubt
they
will
get
it
again
so
sad
the
sweetness
of
the
drink
should
not
die
so
quickly
i
also
did
not
appreciate
how
dominating
the
booziness
was
in
the
finish
o
the
spice
notes
are
not
as
pronounced
as
i
expected
which
is
nice
beautiful
blanket
of
belgian
funk
really
takes
over
and
i
love
that
strawberry
banana
and
citrus
notes
are
huge
finishes
similar
to
a
funky
saison
complex
with
no
alcohol
presence
this
beer
poured
out
as
an
amber
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
on
the
spicy
side
with
some
sweet
malts
shining
through
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
some
nice
herbal
flavors
that
i
found
pretty
interesting
the
mouthfeel
was
well
balanced
and
was
drinkable
with
a
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
its
one
that
i
would
be
interested
revisiting
a
sweet
aromatic
brew
this
is
one
time
im
glad
hitachino
nest
comes
in
a
small
bottle
while
i
enjoyed
this
ale
quite
a
bit
a
little
bit
of
this
intense
beer
goes
a
long
way
d
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
the
high
alcohol
is
not
very
noticeable
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
herbedspiced
beers
available
the
spice
mix
in
this
beer
works
well
this
is
a
bit
of
an
odd
bird
but
pretty
enjoyable
would
go
great
with
dessert
or
most
asian
food
overall
an
interesting
and
complex
beer
with
nothing
offensive
but
doesnt
seem
worth
a
repeat
purchase
to
me
o
bit
of
a
unique
beer
for
high
abv
doesnt
feel
overly
boozey
but
then
we
can
be
getting
used
to
drinking
7
beer
worth
a
try
not
a
bad
brew
mostly
malty
with
hints
of
interest
here
and
there
i
had
thought
that
maybe
it
had
simplified
and
diminished
a
bit
with
age
but
the
bottle
says
still
good
for
another
year
so
take
that
however
you
like
o
this
is
a
very
strange
beer
and
one
that
im
not
sure
what
my
opinion
is
i
think
im
tending
towards
liking
this
but
without
a
really
good
reason
the
carbonation
is
distracting
there
is
so
much
going
on
in
the
flavors
that
i
feel
like
this
beer
really
doesnt
know
what
it
is
trying
to
be
the
flavors
are
diverse
but
not
well
integrated
with
each
other
even
after
3
yrs
of
age
and
sometimes
even
clash
why
do
i
like
this
i
dont
really
know
but
i
do
like
it
overall
a
nice
brew
not
too
strong
with
complex
flavor
carbonation
in
my
bottle
was
very
high
and
took
away
from
the
experience
a
little
i
bought
a
couple
more
kiuchi
beers
to
try
hopefully
they
wont
overflow
with
foam
like
this
one
price
15
at
the
gramercy
tavern
o
if
you
want
a
highgravity
hefeweizen
that
has
full
flavor
this
beer
is
perfect
for
you
caramel
pour
with
lively
tight
carbonation
massively
fruity
aroma
redolent
of
ripe
tropical
fruit
up
front
very
spicy
very
fruity
with
some
caramel
malt
following
in
the
wake
a
bit
of
bite
from
the
alcohol
spice
is
pleasant
at
first
but
grows
almost
oppressive
toward
the
end
ending
on
a
quite
forceful
spiced
note
that
is
almost
but
not
quite
too
much
i
actually
mistook
this
for
the
2004
new
year
celebration
ale
at
first
my
favorite
of
their
beers
and
with
some
age
on
it
maybe
my
favorite
belgian
strong
dark
ales
sadly
missed
that
one
glad
i
picked
it
up
anyway
though
unhappy
to
be
out
nearly
6
for
the
exploding
bottle
cheers
to
kiuchi
busy
at
the
moment
bottling
water
for
quake
victims
heres
hoping
for
a
full
if
not
speedy
recovery
overall
pretty
good
a
big
flavor
even
though
the
aroma
is
lacking
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
vigorous
head
and
lacing
would
drink
this
one
again
d
very
pleasant
and
smooth
not
too
heavy
the
perfect
dessert
drink
to
finish
a
dinner
d
very
nice
first
time
to
have
this
but
its
a
winner
sad
hitachino
has
such
poor
consistency
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
in
my
glass
whatever
little
amount
of
white
foam
initially
crowned
the
beer
disappeared
immediately
very
disappointing
the
nose
is
a
bit
better
though
vanilla
comes
through
very
prominently
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
come
through
a
bit
as
well
with
a
slight
welcome
citrusy
aroma
from
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
closing
things
out
that
great
vanilla
note
is
greatly
diminished
in
the
flavor
which
hurts
the
beer
a
fair
bit
it
had
really
provided
the
foundation
for
the
other
spices
and
influences
to
come
in
over
the
top
of
in
the
aroma
and
without
it
theres
no
real
support
for
the
various
flavors
the
body
is
solidly
middle
of
the
road
appropriately
in
the
background
the
carbonation
though
is
way
over
aggressive
creating
a
distinct
harsh
fizziness
with
each
sip
i
believe
this
is
my
third
beer
from
hitachino
nest
and
i
still
havent
found
one
that
impresses
d
glad
i
split
the
bottle
not
a
winner
d
another
tasty
brew
from
kiuchi
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
xmas
eve
with
some
kind
of
tasty
fall
spiced
baked
good
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
sticky
finish
drinkability
is
good
although
the
bombardment
of
spices
may
make
it
a
bit
overwhelming
at
times
got
this
as
a
christmas
present
its
an
instant
favorite
research
says
that
its
brewed
as
a
new
year
beer
i
want
to
make
this
a
tradition
d
drank
decent
and
was
a
good
herbal
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
sahti
style
beer
i
didnt
know
the
japanese
had
it
in
them
d
a
rally
good
spiced
beer
with
plenty
to
offer
drinkability
is
so
so
the
beer
is
rather
pricey
little
less
the
5
a
12oz
the
medium
body
with
the
high
carbonation
makes
the
beer
very
filling
smooth
creamy
a
very
good
beer
but
very
hard
to
place
the
style
saison
triple
herbedspiced
it
is
not
any
one
but
a
good
winter
warmer
nonetheless
a
bit
sweet
and
boozy
for
a
session
just
one
is
plenty
really
good
brew
my
only
other
japanese
beer
experience
came
from
sapporo
who
is
to
japan
as
budweiser
is
to
the
usa
i
assume
this
was
a
welcome
surprise
on
an
impulse
buy
i
liked
the
owl
on
the
bottle
d
decently
hidden
abv
listed
as
8
on
the
bottle
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
for
me
too
much
cinnamon
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
more
orange
paired
with
it
otherwise
a
very
solid
spiced
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
that
can
be
found
on
a
regular
basis
beautiful
orange
color
with
offwhite
low
profile
head
nose
is
slick
and
sweet
smelling
very
floral
with
notes
of
pale
caramel
palate
is
fat
but
balanced
by
creamy
carbonation
floral
and
caramel
flavors
a
bit
boozy
but
a
long
spicy
finish
d
this
is
an
enjoyable
interesting
beer
it
has
a
good
taste
that
pretty
easy
to
drink
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
at
the
store
d
quite
quaffable
but
in
small
quantities
i
would
try
this
well
balanaced
ale
again
for
certain
but
not
for
a
few
months
interesting
beer
sometimes
this
is
what
its
about
for
me
something
original
difficult
to
categorize
and
stays
with
you
for
a
while
first
of
all
yes
5
for
appearance
hazy
ochre
orange
with
a
mountainous
head
that
started
at
about
3
fingers
and
was
still
1
finger
at
the
end
of
the
glass
brilliant
an
eclectic
aroma
of
orange
spice
lemon
coriander
cinnamon
and
a
slight
hint
of
vanilla
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
bad
boy
noticeable
but
not
hot
or
overpowering
the
flavours
are
again
an
interesting
orgy
of
witbier
strong
ale
and
american
pale
ale
maybe
it
doesnt
fit
perfectly
into
any
particular
category
according
to
bjcp
but
who
really
cares
an
individual
d
i
wasnt
really
digging
this
at
the
start
but
it
got
better
near
the
end
i
thought
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
a
great
beer
either
i
think
it
may
have
come
together
better
with
some
age
but
im
not
enthusiastic
about
it
enough
to
bother
trying
appearance
cloudy
orange
amber
smell
i
did
not
pick
up
much
aroma
at
all
with
this
beer
maybe
a
little
yeast
though
taste
spices
come
through
strong
with
a
solid
backbone
of
orange
maltiness
mouth
feel
not
cloying
and
just
less
than
a
barley
wine
drinkability
tasty
full
bodied
brew
i
would
think
about
buying
another
overall
nice
beer
with
a
lot
of
spice
i
dont
remember
what
i
paid
for
it
this
brew
pours
a
murky
copper
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
a
frothy
two
finger
head
and
sticky
lacing
everywherethe
aroma
is
very
herbalspiceypeppery
with
some
orange
and
vanilla
in
there
aswellit
has
a
nice
full
creamy
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
spicey
orange
peelsvanilla
and
fruitcake
laced
hopsoverall
a
nice
brew
that
once
again
for
this
brewery
is
different
to
most
other
breweries
brews
and
ive
gotta
say
i
havnt
had
a
bad
brew
from
this
brewery
yet
even
though
this
brew
isnt
my
favourite
from
this
brewery
it
is
still
a
top
notch
brew
so
if
you
havnt
tried
their
brews
yet
and
see
them
i
recommend
you
do
d
a
tasty
strong
spiced
brew
the
beer
is
nice
for
half
the
glass
but
as
it
warms
seems
to
become
more
alcohol
influenced
and
the
attenuation
isnt
there
the
yeast
notes
of
pineapple
and
spice
seems
to
fit
sippin
in
winter
not
the
best
kiuchi
beer
ive
ever
had
i
would
want
the
body
and
malt
to
both
be
bigger
to
offset
the
spices
worth
trying
but
wont
be
looking
for
it
again
d
good
winter
beer
nice
and
spicy
would
be
good
on
a
cold
night
a
pleasant
subdued
but
still
thoroughly
flavourful
holiday
ale
one
with
strong
mirrorworld
bsda
holidayseason
tendencies
the
largeish
8
here
alcohol
is
well
integrated
manifesting
in
nothing
more
than
a
particularly
suitable
warming
and
as

last

hours
of

zoom
by
the
labels
fortune
cookieesque
english
translation
of
a
decidedly
forwardlooking
upbeat
new
years
saying
actually
hits
the
spot
right
now
all
in
all
doesnt
blow
my
skirt
up
though
the
elements
go
together
quite
well
but
its
a
combination
that
simply
doesnt
pull
it
together
at
least
not
over
my
palate
perhaps
not
listed
properly
this
would
make
a
decent
saison
although
thats
still
not
high
up
on
my
list
of
preferred
styles
either
d
a
good
winter
warmer
and
for
that
i
should
have
read
the
side
of
the
bottle
i
picked
this
one
up
at
mitsuwa
to
go
with
some
sushi
and
i
can
assure
you
the
two
dont
mix
well
however
i
will
admit
that
was
my
own
fault
for
incorrectly
stereotyping
this
beer
as
a
japanese
beer
for
japanese
food
this
was
a
great
introduction
to
micro
beers
from
japan
i
have
the
inside
scoop
on
a
number
of
new
ones
that
should
be
hitting
shelves
in
alberta
soon
i
think
the
bottles
alone
will
make
these
quite
popular
and
the
fact
that
the
beer
inside
is
quite
good
wont
hurt
their
cause
kudos
to
the
nest
for
constantly
trying
interesting
styles
no
one
else
in
asia
is
doing
anything
like
it
d
interesting
beer
but
is
almost
like
a
meal
in
a
glass
with
how
heavy
it
is
mixed
with
aal
the
spice
and
citrus
d
a
good
drinkable
example
of
a
spiced

brew
2009
edition
with
vanilla
beans
corriander
orange
peel
nutmeg
cinnamon
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
orange
peel
and
corriander
come
through
strong
in
the
aroma
but
the
other
spices
are
still
there
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
very
little
malt
or
hops
in
the
smell
the
flavor
is
all
about
the
spices
very
spicy
the
citrus
components
mix
with
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
to
create
a
powerful
flavor
that
overwhealms
all
other
flavors
malt
and
hops
are
hidden
the
alcohol
is
also
apparent
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
but
the
way
the
spices
coat
the
mouth
it
makes
it
seem
more
full
the
drinkability
suffers
here
in
my
opinion
there
is
just
too
much
spice
and
too
much
alcohol
that
isnt
balanced
interesting
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
oh
yeah
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
vanilla
bean
this
really
should
be
classified
an
herbspiced
beer
reviewing
it
as
a
winter
warmer
might
bring
down
the
score
commemorative
ale
2009
i
know
ba
calls
it
a
winter
warmer
but
im
looking
at
it
like
an
herbedspiced
beer
kind
of
in
the
same
vein
as
anchors
happy
christmas
merry
new
year
beer
i
mean
with
vanilla
beans
corriander
orange
peel
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
whatever
else
how
can
it
not
be
a
spiced
ale
whatever
burnt
amber
tan
head
very
very
good
retention
but
little
lace
nose
is
vanilla
right
off
the
bat
and
maple
syrup
citrus
and
cinnamon
seem
to
be
the
other
highlights
very
strong
very
pleasant
nose
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
of
everything
i
already
mentioned
but
the
corriander
and
nutmeg
come
out
a
lot
more
some
sourness
arises
like
grapefruit
sour
and
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
booziness
to
it
that
mixed
with
the
carbonation
produces
a
touch
of
a
prickly
feeling
this
beer
could
easily
be
confused
as
representing
a
few
different
styles
and
that
is
what
is
cool
about
it
and
interesting
about
the
brewery
itself
cutting
edge
always
pressing
the
limits
pricey
but
a
definite
must
for
the
kiuchi
fan
picking
up
just
to
try
drinkability
is
good
good
balance
really
cool
and
interesting
beer
pours
a
cloudy
darkened
amber
medium
sized
off
white
head

drops
down
to
a
thin
layer
rather
quick
some
spots
on
the
glass
very
murky
smell
is
neat
wine
citrus
vanilla
and
oak
caramel
some
dark
fruitiness
and
yeast
light
bit
of
sourness
smells
nice
taste
is
similar
caramel
very
woody
vanilla
sherry

of
milky
alcohol
bread
oranges
and
a
bit
of

mouthfeel

full

with
medium
carbonation
some
warmth
going
down
i
liked
this
pretty
interesting
combination
of
flavours
and
aromas
not
too
spicy
which
is
my
usual
complaint
about
winter
warmers
thanks

d
notes
this
is
the
totally
wrong
time
of
the
year
to
be
drinking
this
beer
i
drank
this
in
august
and
am
writing
this
review
of
notes
that
being
said
this
is
a
pretty
solid
well
balanced
brew
that
handles
its
spices
very
well
a
nice
sipping
beer
warming
the
back
of
the
throat
and
palate
mediumfull
body
smooth
almost
creamy
rich
no
hop
bite
at
all
get
one
and
enjoy
it
drinks
like
a
belgian
dubbel
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
have
been
looking
for
more
beers
from
these
guys
ive
had
alot
of
the
others
most
notably
the
red
rice
ale
so
when
i
happened
across
this
i
had
to
buy
a
few
first
thing
i
noticed
is
its
more
carbonated
than
it
should
be
i
feel
like
this
beer
has
a
smoother
taste
hidden
behind
the
excess
of
bubbles
its
still
a
decent
beer
and
has
a
higher
than
expected
abv
worth
trying
you
might
like
it
more
than
i
did
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
though
one
at
a
sitting
would
be
my
limit
drinkability
is
not
bad
not
super
tasty
but
pretty
smooth
and
easy
going
down
in
spite
of
its
size
not
something
however
that
i
wish
to
revisit
anytime
soon
d
the
drinkability
suffers
a
little
on
this
one
from
the
high
residual
sweetness
although
it
hides
its
9
alcohol
well
the
spices
and
sweetness
seem
a
bit
cloying
at
first
but
i
am
liking
it
more
and
more
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
the
spice
character
is
quite
complex
in
the
flavor
at
least
and
the
orange
notes
in
particular
are
excellent
excellent
stuff
definitely
recommended
pours
a
muddy
amberred
color
with
tons
of
foamy
offwhite
head
super
long
lasting
retention
and
spotty
lacing
with
a
yeasty
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
falls
nicely
into
the
glass
smells
primarily
of
orange
peel
and
spices
like
coriander
and
nutmeg
tastes
of
orange
peel
bread
vanilla
nutmeg
and
coriander
medium
in
body
with
lots
of
effervescence
in
the
carbonation
has
a
nice
spiciness
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
an
interesting
beer
but
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
very
citrusy
poured
into
a
snifter
this
commemorative
ale
pours
a
murky
orangeamber
color
with
a
ton
of
offwhite
head
that
drops
very
slowly
that
leads
to
really
nice
lacing
strong
sweet
malt
aroma
with
some
citrus
and
spices
thrown
around
in
the
nose
sweet
flavors
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
with
a
slight
sourtart
ginger
hint
high
carbonation
level
with
a
nice
clean
mouthfeel
but
i
get
that
from
almost
every
hitachino
beer
that
i
have
had
i
am
gld
i
had
a
chance
to
have
it
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
it
tasted
good
but
was
just
too
sweet
for
me
after
my
last
sip
i
knew
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
but
for
one
bottle
it
was
worth
the
try
one
thing
to
note
it
masks
its
9
abv
perfectly
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
buzzed
to
read
that
on
the
label
after
this
one
d
drinks
really
nice
for
9
0abv
smooth
enjoyable
and
festive
spicing
makes
this
a
good
try
pours
a
very
carbonated
hazy
orangeamber
with
a
huge
head
that
fades
to
a
healthy
cap
the
smell
is
really
nice
beautifully
integrated
aromas
of
wood
orange
peel
vanilla
spice
and
belgian
yeast
smells
of
bread
clove
and
spice
very
dry
and
no
one
aroma
dominates
taste
is
similar
but
a
little
less
subtle
sweet
orange
flavors
up
front
followed
by
spicy
hops
and
a
slight
woodiness
and
then
more
subtle
flavorsthat
fall
away
of
orange
peel
vanilla
and
a
slightly
sour
graininess
mouthfeelis
a
little
overcarbonated
early
on
in
the
beer
followed
by
it
being
slightly
washed
out
and
a
touch
tannic
interesting
beer
but
a
little
out
of
whack
in
the
mouthfeel
department
sláinte
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
its
not
bad
in
any
way
its
just
not
the
big
rich
ale
i
was
hoping
for
o
not
clear
at
all
and
highly
carbonated
both
odd
for
the
style
flavor
and
aroma
were
tremendous
overall
one
of
the
best
beer
i
have
had
in
a
while
and
i
was
surprised
when
i
first
taste
it
by
how
excellent
it
is
will
surely
have
it
again

very

not
cloying

not
an
everyday
drinker
but
a
nice
treat
from
time
to
time
f
smooth
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
im
not
sure
it
is
amazing
but
it
has
some
great
kick
to
it
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
i
will
remember
this
for
time
to
come
and
drink
many
more
o
this
is
the
daddy
ill
never
forget
the
day
i
tried
the
original
schneider
weisse
for
the
first
time
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
sample
their
product
fresh
in
munich
consistently
over
the
past
two
years
sadly
their
bottled
product
does
not
compare
to
drinking
the
real
thing
fresh
however
this
is
a
true
advertisement
of
what
this
special
brewery
is
capable
of
a
true
magnum
opus

and

overall
make
no
mistake
this
is
a
heavy
hitter
its
more
deserving
of
an
octane
rating
than
an
abv
that
said
if
youre
prepared
to
spend
the
time
sipping
and
appreciating
the
multitude
of
flavours
on
offer
then
its
a
very
rewarding
beer
drinking
more
than
a
couple
in
one
session
probably
isnt
a
good
idea

aventinus
was
already
one
of
my
favourite
beers
to
begin
with
but
aventinus
weizeneisbock
manages
to
blow
its
stillimpressive
little
brother
completely
out
of
the
water
this
is
an
incredibly
wellmade
beer
and
of
the
severalhundred
different
brews
that
ive
reviewed
on
this
site
it
would
not
be
a
stretch
to
say
that
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
of
the
bunch
the
perfect
way
to
celebrate
850
reviews
great
value
at
its
ontario
price
point
and
an
absolute
musttry
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
to
ensure
that
i
will
be
able
to
enjoy
this
stellar
brew
even
after
the
local
stock
runs
dry
overall
this
reminds
very
much
of
good
trappist
along
the
line
of
rochefort
10
and
chimay
grand
reserve
although
a
bit
more
sweeter
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
during
winter
times
color
is
a
dark
redish
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nose
is
ripe
asian
pear
feel
is
very
rich
taste
is
a
little
boozy
touch
of
sweetness
and
then
a
big
malty
finish
an
outstanding
beer
pour
slowly
to
minimize
sediment
in
your
glass
bottle
of
schneider
eisbock
drank
only
beer
that
i
have
ever
consumer
whilst
slaying
a
dragon
see
you
in
hell
great
beer
you
can
tell
this
is
a
big
beer
but
is
a
very
easy
drinker
at
12
has
that
german
hefe
yeast
flavor
going
on
and
finishes
nice
and
dry
but
with
a
rich
maltiness
wonderful
estery
smell
one
would
expect
from
a
weizen
style
if
you
like
the
weizenbock
from
aventinus
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
basically
an
imperial
version
of
that
beer
i
plan
to
snag
more
of
these
and
enjoy
in
these
winter
months
ill
defiantly
buy
this
beer
again
to
me
this
is
the
perfect
beer
dark
malty
and
high
in
alcohol
without
being
too
boozy
perfect
conclusion
this
is
one
of
the
very
rare
beers
that
i
think
will
actually
get
way
better
with
age
i
have
not
had
a
bottle
of
regular
aventinus
quite
this
young
but
that
beer
has
been
amazing
at
all
ages
just
s
good
with
34
years
as
fresh
just
wonderfully
different
i
think
this
beer
will
simply
get
better
with
age
however
it
is
quite
enjoyable
at
this
age
too
but
one
has
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
bit
of
a
tussle
oa
very
big
beer
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
more
with
each
sip
there
is
a
lot
going
on
and
the
alcohol
is
obvious
but
if
you
know
what
to
expect
this
beer
ticks
all
the
boxes
my
only
knock
would
be
the
soy
flavor
that
felt
somewhat
odd
and
out
of
place
o
great
sipper
for
a
cold
evening
or
morning
pours
a
almost
black
clour
with
a
big
off
white
head
good
retention
smell
of
dried
fruits
spices
vanilla
clove
banana
lemon
alcohol
medium
body
one
expect
some
more
taste
of
prunes
figs
whisky
coffee
banana
spices
this
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
complex
rich
and
one
that
i
sure
will
buy
more
o
ultra
sweet
and
indulgent
beer
if
youre
into
that
kinda
thing
its
great
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
in
the
near
future
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
ive
had
others
by
schneider
and
enjoyed
them
but
didnt
care
for
the
eisbock
overall
this
is
a
wellbalanced
acutely
flavored
winter
beer
incredible
taste
and
surprisingly
light
this
tastes
like
liquefied
cinnamonspice
banana
bread
with
raisins
just
a
mild
warming
sensation
from
the
12
abv
very
good
o
certainly
one
of
the
best
eisbocks
out
there
if
not
the
best
it
might
not
technically
overall
merely
an
okay
beer
heading
back
to
my
local
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
to
cellar
dark
brown
amber
with
insanely
large
coffee
tinged
head
smells
heavy
if
thats
a
thing
alcohol
stands
out
with
cherry
and
fig
malty
syrupy
chewy
mouthfeel
affects
the
taste
sweet
hints
of
honey
butter
treacle
bubble
gum
alcohol
burn
on
the
back
end
didnt
notice
the
hops
at
all
interesting
definitely
has
more
of
a
candy
thing
going
on
than
most
beers
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
dark
brown
kinda
murky
looks
a
lot
like
a
cola
one
finger
head
that
faded
quickly
to
nothing
no
lacing
aroma
is
somewhat
winelike
with
some
molasses
dark
fruit
and
sweet
malt
notes
the
flavor
is
dried
plums
figs
and
some
nice
tart
flavors
it
has
some
qualities
of
a
good
quad
but
with
a
lot
more
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
i
expected
but
very
nice
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
awesome
in
all
respects
even
my
wife
gives
it
the
seal
of
approval

is
one
beautiful

beer
lovers
will
find
this
worth
the
buy
hands
down
but
is
also
very
approachable
for
everyday
joe
seeking
something
new
and
warming
for
the
cold
winter
evenings
thumbs
up
drank
this
with
five
years
on
it
very
complex
intense
combination
of
flavors
truly
one
of
a
kind
o
this
was
one
of
the
if
not
the
best
aroma
experiences
ive
had
with
a
beer
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
cloying
but
i
do
like
the
alcohol
warmth
unfortunately
the
flavor
does
not
equal
the
aroma
first
off
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
and
i
love
big
malt
beers
and
barleywines
however
something
about
this
did
not
sit
with
me
well
the
sweetness
was
cloying
the
mouthfeel
was
too
syrupy
when
i
usually
enjoy
that
from
a
barleywine
there
was
a
licoriceanise
thing
which
i
dont
like
i
also
think
maybe
the
yeast
strain
threw
me
off
because
i
usually
love
beers
this
big
but
do
tend
to
stay
away
from
a
lot
german
and
styles
because
of
the
yeast
funkiness
just
means
i
have
to
keep
trying
stuff
til
i
figure
it
out
pours
a
very
hazy
dark
brown
creamy
head
never
really
goes
away
aroma
and
flavor
is
of
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
definitely
more
of
a
sipping
beer
great
taste
extra
bite
in
the
end
awesome
taste
creamy
mouthfeel
with
an
overarching
yet
unusually
pleasant
note
of
prune
luscious
brew
overalldrinkability
a
likable
dark
beer
not
overly
boozy
goes
down
nice
o
the
most
quadlike
beer
ive
tried
that
wasnt
a
quad
and
while
it
has
some
licorice
notes
which
i
hate
its
got
so
so
much
more
great
winegrape
notes
plenty
of
fruit
and
not
just
dark
fruit
but
lots
of
that
too
and
while
the
alcohol
is
burning
my
throat
the
flavors
are
so
intense
that
i
cant
taste
liquor
fantastic
brew
and
a
style
i
definitely
will
revisit
o
granted
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
style
but
i
feel
like
it
was
pretty
much
a
decent
quad
with
more
faults
the
already
dull
flavors
of
raisins
and
prunes
with
an
added
ethanol
note
not
to
mention
the
bubble
gum
which
i
have
never
found
appropriate
in
any
style
im
all
for
experimentation
and
innovation
which
this
style
has
in
spades
and
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
on
the
whole
but
i
respectfully
wont
be
returning
overall
a
big
bold
badass
bock
from
bavaria
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
is
really
from
the
bavaria
part
of
germany
but
i
was
on
alliteration
roll
there
enjoy
it
slowly
why
dont
eisbocks
get
more
buzz
they
give
plenty
theyre
tasty
this
style
can
hang
with
the
old
ales
and
the
barleywines
of
the
world
id
love
to
see
more
of
these
from
american
brewers
overall
a
truly
new
experience
a
sipper
of
the
utmost
quality
given
the
huge
abv
in
this
beer
deliciously
like
a
more
intense
aventinus
i
only
actually
wish
the
flavor
stuck
around
a
bit
longer
and
was
even
more
intense
still
a
world
class
beer
and
a
phenomenal
sipper
for
a
quiet
night
with
a
book
with
the
snow
continues
to
pile
outside
oliked
sipping
this
a
lot
great
mix
of
flavors
malt
driven
supported
by
yeast
and
banana
flavor
with
a
lot
of
spicy
cloves
and
alcohol
enwrapped
by
sugar
alcohol
becomes
too
present
for
my
taste
as
the
malt
sweetness
begins
to
vanish
gets
supported
only
by
sugar
beer
turns
from
very
sweet
to
sharp
bitter
in
a
splitsecond
due
to
the
alcohol
carbonation
is
fine
supporting
the
body
of
the
beer
oily
honeyed
mouthfeel
this
may
just
be
a
little
too
extreme
for
my
taste
i
dont
find
many
nuances
in
this
beer
as
my
tongue
seems
to
get
numb
by
the
obvious
alcohol
first
impression
is
surprisingly
refreshing
mediumbodied
fruity
and
warm
then
my
palate
gets
hammered
by
lots
of
sugar
followed
by
alcohol
and
alcoholic
bitterness
which
warms
my
belly
although
i
dont
love
it
i
have
to
admit
that
the
beer
by
itself
is
somehow
convincing
its
something
you
should
take
your
time
with
to
adjust
to
the
taste
and
furthermore
the
goal
of
the
beer
as
this
is
the
first
warm
week
of
spring
in
this
year
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
the
streets
around
my
room
covered
in
snow
but
i
think
thats
when
you
should
drink
this
to
warm
yourself
up
when
it
is
very
very
cold
and
you
dont
mind
a
sugar
rush
followed
by
an
alcohol
overdose
because
it
fits
to
the
overall
situation
this
is
a
special
beer
for
special
ocasions
you
shouldnt
drink
it
as
an
every
day
beer
get
ready
for
it
and
try
to
enjoy
this
is
an
enigmatic
beer
it
has
a
classic
doppelbock
aroma
but
carries
it
in
a
huge
abv
format
that
realistically
is
impressively
integrated
its
a
very
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
that
such
a
potent
variation
is
really
needed
to
carry
the
flavor
any
better
than
it
already
is
in
their
regular
weizendoppelbock
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
brewed
ever
if
not
my
absolute
favorite
and
yes
ive
had

i
would
order
this
over
any
of
those
o
this
is
a
big
time
brew
and
a
delicious
one
at
that
overall
the
only
thing
that
prevented
me
from
giving
this
magnificent
beer
a
perfect
5
rating
was
its
lack
of
a
frothy
head
and
lacing
i
know
the
high
alcohol
content
killed
the
chances
of
this
brew
having
any
kind
of
a
pillowy
frothy
head
but
for
a
sticky
beer
you
would
imagine
it
leaving
crazy
lacing
all
over
the
glass
ive
tried
american
style
eisbocks
as
well
as
other
german
eisbocks

none
compares

this

beers
they
decided

move
the

the

is
the
name
of

brewpub
in

and
its
a
institution
with
the

for

they
carry
the

of

beers
even
the

big
beer
a
great
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
very
happy
to
have
made
this
my
150
review
dansmcdoct
18
as
expected
b
o
a
solid
eisbock
do
split
this
with
my
main
squeeze
fdkayti
proved
to
be
a
good
amount
for
each
of
us
would
recommend
and
definitely
have
again
o
without
a
doubt
this
is
a
world
class
beer
i
prefer
it
to
others
including
ayinger
celebrator
trappist
westlvleteren
8
and
and
trappist
rochefort
10
thats
a
bold
statement
but
this
is
an
excellently
crafted
beer
not
to
mention
that
bangforthe
buck
its
cheaper
than
standard
aventinus
and
it
cant
be
beat
im
glad
i
have
more
in
the
fridge
good
beer
but
not
the
gem
that
i
may
have
hoped
for
given
the
reviews
the
wheat
qualities
are
noticeable
but
pretty
subdued
i
certainly
like
it
but
cant
seem
myself
drinking
it
that
often
as
it
is
not
good
enough
to
justify
the
investment
that
500ml
of
12
brew
requires
overall
aventinus
on
steroids
bigtime
sipper
here
pretty
darn
complex
and
enjoyable
o
great
fragrance
and
immediate
taste
that
seems
wel
balanced
at
first
until
the
very
end
of
the
drink
for
the
most
part
it
was
great
just
a
bit
put
off
on
the
finish
great
balance
and
complexity
too
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
high
abv
absolutely
delicious
overall
this
is
a
fine
fine
eisbock
its
less
complex
than
the
ultragood
for
the
style
bottled
rendition
of
aventinuseisbock
it
is
supersmooth
and
superdrinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
the
most
active
beer
ive
ever
seen
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
top
beer
started
gurshing
out
i
put
my
mouth
over
the
bottle
to
keep
the
beer
from
spilling
but
the
beer
kept
gushing
i
thought
man
im
gonna
get
drunk
this
way
pepsi
colored
with
a
very
quick
massive
head
and
just
as
suddenly
no
head
wonderful
aroma
of
dark
fruits
plums
raisins
grapes
hints
of
chocolate
very
thick
and
syrupy
in
the
mouth
but
in
the
best
of
ways
just
kind
of
coats
the
mouth
wonderful
tasting
and
the
alcohol
really
sneaks
up
on
you
this
is
probably
the
most
malt
heavy
beer
ive
had
and
this
hop
head
loves
it
roasted
grains
lots
of
dark
fruit
flavors
hints
of
chocolate
and
bananna
just
enough
sweetness
to
keep
it
balanced
and
a
pepper
spice
finish
i
love
this
beer
highly
recommended
o
absolutely
delicious
quite
potent
definitely
a
keeper
will
purchase
again
and
again
this
is
certainly
not
an
anytime
beer
or
one
to
have
frequently
but
everyone
ought
to
try
it
the
eisbock
style
started
because
of
a
mistake
a
wonderful
mistake
indeed
very
sweet
with
tons
of
fruity
flavor
but
it
doesnt
really
deviate
from
that
much
a
nice
beer
but
certainly
not
the
best
german
style
ice
distilled
beer
ive
had
although
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
what
5
or
10
years
could
do
to
this
beer
light
gold
a
bit
hazy
body
white
head
multiple
streams
of
carbonation
quick
dissipation
and
a
thin
ring
of
foam
around
edge
of
glass
theres
something
wrong
here
wet
cardboard
obviously
oxided
overpowered
any
aroma
and
flavor
nuances
while
im
not
sure
we
would
have
enjoyed
this
re
the
wheat
after
being
pounded
by
brown
sugar
prunes
raisins
etc
we
all
noticed
this
was
one
frigging
boozy
monster
the
low
light
of
the
tasting
another
of
my
big
deviation
beers
the
booziness
reminded
me
of
founders
devil
dancer
and
while
their
are
proponents
of
both
of
these
beers
im
not
one
of
them
pass
o
a
fantastic
beer
much
better
than
other
eisbocks
i
have
had
more
like
plantain
in
the
mouth
semi
sweet
chocolate
covered
caramel
in
the
middle
with
an
abrupt
almost
dry
finish
nonoxidized
sherry
and
port
like
notes
dried
fruits
like
fig
and
dates
and
a
nutty
component
very
nice
rich
and
creamy
warming
lighter
body
low
carbonation
complex
very
nice
to
have
this
quite
enjoyable
overall
unbalanced
brew
the
alcohol
is
very
disturbing
overallmy
first
eisbock
definitely
reminds
me
of
the
weizenbock
just
a
bit
boozier
the
flavors
were
nice
would
like
a
little
less
booze
and
carbonation
i
prefer
the
weizenbock
but
id
liek
to
believe
this
would
be
an
aa
beer
with
age
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
that
is
lightly
carbonated
for
12
abv
the
alcohol
is
well
included
and
is
matched
with
an
array
of
flavors
to
make
it
quite
enjoyable
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
the
eisbock
style
but
this
was
enough
to
spark
my
interest
into
having
more
this
beer
poured
out
of
the
cask
as
a
dark
muddy
brown
color
the
head
on
the
beer
was
nowhere
in
sight
no
lacing
here
either
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
lot
like
the
aventinus
with
just
a
bit
more
booze
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
too
for
the
most
part
the
mouthfeel
is
the
difference
here
its
a
bit
on
the
flatter
side
from
the
cask
and
the
aftertaste
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
bit
of
a
boozy
heat
that
warms
the
chest
overall
i
like
both
brews
a
lot
i
may
even
like
this
more
from
a
bottle
both
are
great
beers
to
try
and
i
would
like
to
have
them
again
the
beer
is
a
burnt
orange
hue
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
leaving
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
brings
bananas
dark
fruits
wheat
clove
and
alcohol
quite
tasty
bananas
soaked
in
alcohol
and
a
rum
characteristic
work
well
together
sweetness
and
alcohol
are
present
throughout
making
this
bottle
optimal
for
sharing
as
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
half
the
bottle
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
moderately
low
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
though
i
seldom
drink
beers
of
this
ilk
overall
at
4
99
a
bottle
this
is
worth
it
i
have
never
tasted
a
better
beer
i
give
it
an
overall
rating
of
666
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
probably
my
favorite
wheat
beer
to
date
such
strong
yet
well
balanced
flavors
and
still
very
easy
to
drink
i
certainly
will
be
trying
this
one
again
certainly
not
a
beer
i
can
imagine
anyone
drinking
often
from
the
first
sniff
i
knew
this
would
be
a
huge
beer
and
i
was
right
good
flavor
but
the
big
abv
hurts
it
regular
aventinus
would
be
my
choice
out
of
two
fo
sho
o
holy
shit
i
had
no
idea
about
the
alcohol
or
its
presence
although
you
want
to
say
its
overly
hot
i
feel
it
actually
provides
part
of
a
balance
that
the
hops
cant
and
dont
overall
this
was
quite
an
overwhelming
experience
for
me
i
didnt
even
really
look
into
whether
this
beer
would
age
well
or
not
but
wow
it
does
i
havent
had
this
beer
fresh
in
a
very
long
time
but
i
remember
it
being
fairly
hot
and
all
of
that
has
passed
for
sure
this
is
what
sam
adams
triple
bock
wishes
it
was
i
think
ill
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
to
age
and
advise
you
all
to
do
the
same
had
this
on
tap
and
i
found
it
pretty
amazing
poured
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
caramel
and
sweet
fruits
in
the
nose
toasty
malts
in
the
taste
caramel
and
a
wallop
of
candy
and
dark
fruitsraisins
cherries
bananas
figs
the
fruit
balanced
out
the
inevitable
spiced
rum
alcohol
bite
of
this
semidistilled
12abv
eisbock
mediumbodied
and
chewy
very
nice
and
drinkable
definitely
to
be
savored
slowly
i
guess
its
good
the
soapy
thing
is
just
something
i
have
a
hard
time
with
i
have
one
more
left
but
think
i
will
just
pass
it
on
bottle
20088167
pours
a
light
cola
brown
with
a
short
lived
head
and
leaves
very
light
lacing
appears
to
be
lightly
carbonated
and
scaring
me
right
now
as
it
looks
like
the
pannepot
disaster
i
drank
recently
nose
has
pure
cola
ginko
nut
with
a
smooth
vanilla
bourbon
note
taste
is
somewhat
spicy
with
chicory
coffee
and
sea
salt
caramel
finishes
a
bit
astrigent
and
acidic
to
some
extent
thats
nice
because
at
12
you
dont
taste
or
sense
a
hint
of
alcohol
jd
o
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
beers
and
my
favorite
wheat
beer
get
this
beer
and
enjoy
every
drop
overall
this
was
a
great
find
enjoyed
this
beer
from
start
to
finish
i
think
that
it
hides
the
12
well
but
definitely
brings
some
heat
to
this
brew
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
o
this
is
very
tasty
just
overly
sweet
for
my
palate
definitely
a
sipper
and
i
really
dont
find
myself
saying
that
too
often
i
love
it
highly
impressed
o
love
this
find
not
often
that
i
find
any
eisbock
but
if
anyone
happens
to
see
this
one
go
for
it
it
will
be
like
a
fine
wine
of
beers
for
you
im
happy
i
finally
had
a
use
for
my
big
bubble
top
aventinus
glass
that
just
seams
to
sit
in
my
cupboard
an
interesting
brew
and
if
my
memory
serves
me
i
liked
the
unfrozen
version
even
more
then
this
and
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
i
need
to
thank
liamt07
for
knocking
yet
another
beer
off
my
want
list
o
this
is
a
truly
amazing
brew
gets
the
banana
bread
taste
like
no
other
beer
has
ever
had
just
a
tiny
tad
too
sweet
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
nutlike
taste
in
the
brew
but
for
this
i
guess
i
only
need
to
drink
the
regular
aventinus
drinkability
is
pretty
high
for
a
beer
this
strong
j
drinkability
another
amzing
beer
from
them
overall
a
bit
more
intense
than
the
regular
aventinus
notes
condensed
aventinus
what
is
not
to
like
if
one
does
not
mistake
it
for
the
regular
version
sorry
sis
it
wasnt
me
i
wasnt
there
p
this
is
quite
a
nice
savoring
ale
btw
since
they
dont
mention
and
it
is
a
relatively
recent
twist
done
by
freezing
the
brew
esibocks
are
not
done
according
to
the
reinheistgebot
p
definitely
worth
trying
but
far
from
being
a
session
beer
i
was
one
and
done
this
bottle
was
shared
with
zep9865
during
our
mini
tasting
before
dld
this
beer
pours
a
murky
raisin
brown
with
a
beige
head
that
laces
the
glass
ive
had
this
one
before
but
never
reviewed
it
this
smells
super
and
syrupy
sweet
it
wreaks
of
sweet
dark
malts
raisins
figs
and
light
yeast
the
nose
is
even
a
little
sweet
for
me
this
beer
is
very
yeasty
and
very
heavy
on
the
raisins
wow
is
it
sweet
its
hard
to
even
rate
to
style
when
a
beer
is
this
sweet
its
borderline
cloying
it
drinks
medium
in
body
but
the
sweetness
prevails
above
all
other
aspects
does
this
beer
taste
good
yes
but
in
small
quantities
the
alcohol
content
doesnt
even
matter
to
me
because
this
is
super
malty
and
understandably
so
and
super
fruity
i
just
cant
get
past
the
sweetness
its
a
nice
style
to
try
but
this
beer
specifically
just
isnt
for
me
this
beer
enjoyed
at
the
abner
in
a
pint
glass
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
trace
of
off
white
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
and
has
little
retention
the
aroma
is
strong
with
caramel
and
figs
and
spices
the
taste
starts
with
notes
of
fog
and
caramel
and
then
finishes
with
a
slight
alcohol
taste
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
you
would
think
for
a
12
point
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
fo
the
amount
of
alcohol
overall
a
great
beer
but
leave
it
to
one
o
an
excellent
eisbock
with
a
nice
complexity
and
harmony
of
flavors
and
body
just
drank
a
pint
at
the
bulldog
tavern
and
emporium
of
fine
and
most
excellent
brews
and
spirits
average
head
and
carbonation
with
a
credible
amount
of
lacing
smell
of
alcohol
and
malts
color
was
bodacious
mouthfeel
was
like
heavenly
night
blooming
jasmine
with
a
hint
of
mirliitons
and
cypress
buds
taste
was
equally
balanced
with
flowers
and
trees
this
brew
should
be
in
the
hall
of
fame
of
eisbocks
ill
never
forget
tonight
and
this
brew
even
if
was
overpriced
compared
to
ma
favorite
ipas
d
a
very
good
sipping
beer
overall
a
very
tasty
eisbock
from
germany
a
really
good
bottle
i
will
plan
on
getting
a
few
to
drink
and
some
to
age
and
see
what
happens
i
dont
need
any
heat
to
mellow
but
just
want
to
see
what
will
happen
and
these
are
cheap
should
be
fun
prickly
but
light
carbonation
in
a
medium
to
heavy
body
this
beer
is
a
phenomenal
offering
from
schneider
the
fruity
depth
rivals
that
of
the
most
well
done
russian
imperial
stouts
and
the
ease
of
drinking
is
top
notch
at
12
this
is
more
than
a
little
bit
dangerous
o
an
interesting
brew
the
concentrated
alcohol
drowns
out
a
lot
of
the
softer
hefe
notes
that
i
felt
the
standard
aventinus
had
done
a
fantastic
job
of
retaining
that
said
the
alcohol
accentuates
a
variety
of
new
flavors
notably
the
molasses
liquorish
and
spice
im
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
trade
off
though
picked
this
one
up
a
while
back
at
some
liquor
store
or
other
as
it
sounded
good
and
the
price
was
solid
about
2
bucks
as
i
recall
poured
a
slightly
less
than
clear
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
booze
dark
fruits
banana
and
clove
thick
and
full
bodied
boozy
with
spicy
wheat
cloves
bananas
and
booze
soaked
raisins
producing
a
drinkable
eisbock
is
hard
enough
producing
one
so
downright
beautifully
flavored
is
sheer
art
if
youre
in
the
mood
this
beer
will
take
you
where
you
want
to
go
be
careful
overall
its
good
i
am
not
a
great
friend
of
bocks
of
any
kind
but
i
can
give
this
one
the
respect
it
deserves
at
12
abv
it
is
a
good
sipper
id
guess
this
should
hold
up
to
some
age
and
that
should
mellow
the
alcohol
there
is
a
really
good
if
not
great
beer
hiding
under
that
alcohol
this
is
like
the
bigger
blacker
cousin
of
aventinus
delicious
and
hot
while
strikingly
drinkable
while
being
a
high
abv
beer
this
is
somethin
else
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
and
the
finish
clean
incredible
for
a
12
beer
well
i
say
beer
but
really
this
has
lost
much
of
its
connection
with
the
beer
family
and
the
evolution
is
something
to
behold
i
expected
this
to
be
good
but
this
is
exceptional
well
played
german
brewers
well
played
hides
its
high
abv
very
well
i
have
to
say
it
again
dessert
quad
easy
to
drink
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
not
as
drinkable
as
the
standard
version
due
to
the
alcohol
concentration
but
it
still
has
the
nice
body
and
carries
the
quailty
that
schneider
is
famous
for
overall
a
really
fine
beer
if
you
like
wheat
and
intensity
both
this
beer
combines
them
perfectly
not
a
big
fan
i
drank
the
whole
thing
but
it
was
more
like
soda
to
me
oh
well
was
excited
for
it
but
cant
like
em
all
i
suppose
d
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
one
and
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
it
the
strong
flavors
of
spices
and
hops
really
made
this
a
great
sipper
highly
recommended
d
its
very
tasty
but
to
me
this
is
a
desert
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
the
meantime
its
too
intense
for
my
girlfriend
so
i
have
to
finish
12
ounces
shouldnt
be
too
hard
though
d
one
bottle
would
pretty
much
be
the
limit
on
this
i
split
this
between
a
few
friends
and
even
just
5
or
so
ounces
was
a
good
warm
up
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
though
not
overbearing
i
definitely
prefer
the
regular
version
though
this
is
still
a
very
good
eisbock
not
bad
but
i
much
prefer
regular
aventinus
d
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
is
pretty
much
everything
that
i
was
expecting
it
is
a
amped
up
version
of
an
already
amazing
beer
has
some
alcohol
aroma
and
flavor
but
doesnt
drink
at
all
like
12
dreally
great
the
12
abv
is
not
obvious
will
definitely
get
again
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
i
would
have
it
again
pours
a
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
tan
head
that
lasts
for
the
whole
beer
sticky
ring
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
dark
fruits
caramel
wheat
and
alcohol
sharpness
tastes
of
overripe
dark
fruit
caramel
sweetness
and
alcohol
this
beer
was
very
carbonated
in
my
opinion
and
had
a
very
sticky
mouthfeel
an
alcohol
burn
was
present
with
each
sip
drinkability
is
above
average
but
with
the
alcohol
burn
and
the
almost
sickly
sweetness
i
dont
think
i
would
get
this
again
i
have
a
2007
in
my
collection
that
im
excited
to
try
in
a
year
or
two
this
beer
just
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
with
age
i
think
its
going
to
be
epic
this
was
my
first
eisbock
drank
it
on
an
empty
stomach
wow
a
noteworthy
experience
but
not
a
beer
i
would
have
multiples
of
good
for
a
winter
night
by
the
fire
to
feel
the
warmth
but
a
night
out
on
the
town
and
i
would
be
looking
at
the
bottom
of
the
bar
stool
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
this
beer
must
age
well
with
a
possibly
twoyear
old
bottle
still
providing
good
aromas
and
flavors
although
it
reminds
of
a
wine
the
mouthfeel
is
much
thicker
with
a
stronger
taste
of
alchohol
than
in
the
aroma
it
is
not
very
drinkable
to
me
due
to
the
high
abv
and
sweetness
d
yes
sir
this
stuff
is
delicious
and
i
never
would
have
guessed
it
was
12
hot
damn
very
warming
yet
refreshing
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
effervescent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
rich
with
dried
fruits
yeast
and
bread
the
taste
is
huge
dried
fruits
plum
raisin
with
typical
weizen
banana
and
a
big
cereal
malt
flavor
alcohol
flavor
is
very
strong
but
well
matched
with
the
big
malt
taste
palate
is
fullbodied
and
thick
with
a
longlasting
malty
aftertaste
wonderful
beer
i
can
drink
this
stuff
all
night
if
i
pace
myself
right
this
is
my
first
eisbock
maybe
this
just
isnt
a
true
representation
but
reminds
me
more
of
a
belgianstyle
beer
im
not
complaining
though
prost
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
this
beer
might
be
a
regular
for
me
d
obviously
is
not
a
one
sip
beer
if
you
have
the
time
to
enjoy
one
this
can
be
a
nice

this
bottle
035611
has
been
in
my
cellar
for
at
least
five
years
fairly
clear
raspberry
brown
hue
is
punctuated
by
a
few
chunks
and
capped
with
a
light
tan
head
that
nearly
disappears
by
the
end
smells
vinous
with
blackberries
and
black
cherries
and
gives
the
impression
of
fruit
rollups
or
raspberry
tootsie
rolls
it
is
very
smooth
and
quite
malty
with
a
dark
rich
flavor
and
only
a
light
sweetness
vinous
and
dark
fruits
pop
up
with
burnt
sugar
dark
caramel
noticeable
wheat
mild
bitterness
and
just
a
hint
of
oxidation
it
has
a
wellcarbonated
thick
and
smooth
body
that
is
chalky
and
dry
with
a
warming
finish
this
unique
beer
is
delicious
and
imminently
sippable
and
makes
a
great
addition
to
anybodys
cellar
piece
by
piece
node
by
node
everything
in
this
beer
is
good
but
like
i
said
it
just
dont
jibe
together
very
well
a
classic
wheat
doppelbock
this
is
a
concentrated
version
of
the
original
and
revered
aventinus
weizenbock
and
a
welcome
recreation
of
a
brewing
storage
error
d
very
surprising
drinks
like
an
old
ale
on
top
of
the
already
perfect
aventinus
alcohol
heat
is
not
bothersome
and
hidden
very
well
behind
some
very
nice
yeast
and
bready
notes
has
the
signature
aventinus
flavor
profile
that
makes
for
an
incredibly
drinkable
eisbock
d
i
believe
this
has
improved
over
time
mostly
in
the
nose
however
the
appearance
appears
to
have
suffered
id
chalk
that
up
to
using
a
different
glass
and
probably
a
different
serving
temp
quite
drinkable
for
a
12

beer

this
eisbock
is
totally
great
salud
complex
very
challenging
i
know
what
i
want
with
it
ice
cream
but
its
best
by
itself
banana
caramel
cloves
watch
out
as
the
12
is
almost
undetectable
with
this
childhood
inducing
creamy
beer
dont
drink
as
much
as
you
will
want
to
it
will
catch
up
with
you
in
the
morning
but
enjoy
pours
a
very
murky
brown
color
that
seems
to
be
layered
much
lighter
at
the
top
definitely
an
unfiltered
bottle
conditioned
brew
tiny
white
head
that
disappears
in
an
instant
scent
is
very
wheatlike
with
some
definite
banana
aromas
i
also
get
some
yeast
clove
and
light
chocolate
taste
is
banana
wheat
spices
heavy
on
clove
at
first
bubblegum
then
followed
by
dark
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
the
yeasty
flavors
linger
throughout
the
whole
taste
as
well
as
the
alcohol
the
alcohol
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
well
balanced
as
was
hoping
for
but
nonetheless
it
is
an
amazingly
delicious
beer
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
but
remains
very
wellcarbonated
alcohol
burn
towards
the
end
drinkability
is
fairly
high
considering
how
tasty
this
is
but
the
abv
will
creep
up
on
you
in
an
instant
so
be
careful
edit
flavors
become
more
readily
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
and
loses
carbonation
as
it
sits
in
the
glass
if
you
refrigerate
this
beer
i
recommend
that
you
leave
it
to
sit
out
for
about
10
minutes
before
pouring
doddly
very
drinkable
not
something
you
would
usually
say
about
a
12
beer
you
imagine
sipping
this
by
a
fire
after
shovelling
snow
for
a
couple
hours
drinkability
i
love
this
style
of
beer
would
have
it
in
stock
again
for
those
who
want
something
a
little
different
but
good
d
i
dont
really
know
how
to
call
this
part
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
meant
for
sipping
its
a
huge
beer
but
handles
itself
well
enough
i
think
pours
a
murky
and
dense
rusty
brown
with
some
sediment
eveident
here
finger
or
two
of
eggshell
head
ok
retention
nose
is
big
strong
raisin
caramel
loads
of
butterscotch
and
fusel
alcohol
almost
resembling
vodka
at
times
yowza
i
can
sense
the
heat
coming
tastes
of
dark
fruits
plums
raisin
thick
and
massive
caramel
and
butterscotch
notes
again
dark
fruits
take
a
real
backseat
to
the
butterscotch
as
i
move
through
this
medium
high
carbonation
large
and
filling
mouthfeel
almost
great
body
this
was
a
sipper
for
real
heat
was
really
here
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
to
experience
but
i
think
i
still
prefer
regular
aventinus
drinkability
at
12
abv
this
is
a
hefty
beer
however
i
get
no
heat
ultimately
i
think
this
beer
could
use
perhaps
a
couple
years
to
become
truly
excellent
i
have
a
great
respect
for
g
schneider
sohn
and
they
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
refrigerator
this
particular
bottle
was
picked
up
just
today
but
was
bottled
is
september
of
2007
never
underestimate
the
little
beer
distributor
this
is
a
great
cold
night
warm
by
the
fireside
beer
that
has
gotten
richer
with
age
ive
tasted
an
earlier
vintage
and
there
is
a
big
difference
in
depth
of
flavor
i
wouldnt
have
another
i
dont
think
pretty
rich
but
is
great
while
you
have
it
drinkability
too
strong
to
be
very
drinkable
but
certainly
not
bad
in
any
way
d
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
i
think
only
the
mouthfeel
and
the
hidden
abv
would
keep
me
from
having
quite
a
few
of
these
delightful
brews
this
was
suggested
by
this
site
and
my
beer
guy
at
local
binnys
i
have
been
tempted
to
try
this
style
for
some
time
and
look
forward
to
trying
other
representations
from
various
breweries
in
the
future
pours
a
murky
deep
brown
with
a
light
tan
fizzy
head
recedes
quickly
nose
is
dark
grapes
bread
sweet
spices
caramel
malt
taste
is
complex
as
well
dark
fruits
are
forefront
some
phenol
noticeable
cloyingly
sweet
and
mild
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
large
format
bottle
is
nice
looking
great
label
wish
i
liked
this
more
than
i
do
not
a
favourite
style
of
beer
i
guess
drinkable
for
sure
smooth
on
the
palate
and
easy
to
enjoy
d
a
nice
brew
with
an
interesting
flavor
i
havent
had
many
eisbocks
so
its
tough
to
compare
overall
i
always
love
this
beer
and
have
had
it
on
several
occasions
im
a
big
fan
of
the
regular
aventinus
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
if
you
want
a
desert
sipper
or
something
to
brag
about
in
front
of
your
bmc
loving
friends
take
a
few
of
these
home
just
be
careful
they
go
down
way
to
easy
and
will
easily
get
you
hurt
lol
cheers
slightly
thinner
body
lower
carbonation
a
little
sticky
and
dry
drinks
pretty
well
although
theres
a
somewhat
off
putting
astringency
which
is
almost
tart
it
wasnt
an
infection
but
just
something
that
i
wasnt
really
into
drinkability
is
really
good
i
wouldnt
recommend
drinking
them
back
to
back
but
you
could
d
this
is
fairly
boozy
but
then
again
its
12
this
is
a
welldeveloped
and
remarkable
brew
it
appeals
to
my
love
for
big
strong
beers
but
the
tartness
and
malted
wheat
make
it
unique
one
of
my
favorites
i
wonder
how
it
ages
d
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
were
phenomenal
however
the
12
really
made
itself
known
and
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
could
be
dangerous
as
much
as
the
flavor
of
this
one
is
pleasant
the
drinkability
is
terrible
for
me
its
just
too
intensely
sweet
and
flavorful
and
theres
too
much
alcohol
its
like
a
perfectly
good
aventinus
drenched
in
vodka
not
a
fan
cheers
dthis
beer
is
almost
too
easy
drinking
abv
is
nonexistent
eric
id
say
that
when
compared
to
regular
aventinus
this
is
less
spicy
more
alcoholic
and
perhaps
a
bit
less
sweet
as
well
overall
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
given
the
12
abv
the
big
caramel
combined
with
the
wheat
and
alcohol
warmth
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
abv
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
over
the
cold
holidays
in
front
of
a
fireplace
with
some
smoked
gouda
massive
clove
and
green
apple
notes
that
were
either
absent
or
passed
undetected
last
time
were
present
both
in
taste
and
aroma
while
the
malt
character
seemed
smaller
against
the
other
beers
it
was
interesting
to
see
that
how
a
beer
that
seemed
very
malt
forward
by
itself
had
other
elements
fruit
spice
that
came
out
beautifully
when
contrasted
against
others
it
was
easy
to
detect
the
base
german
beer
character
too
that
seemed
lost
in
the
previous
bottle
very
full
on
the
palate
and
sptrizy
too
with
some
morishly
banana
notes
moving
towards
a
richness
here
but
still
some
way
from
ode
to
joy
more
john
stuart
mill
than
it
should
be
i
can
see
why
this
beer
would
be
rated
as
someones
personal
favorite
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
but
it
seems
to
fit
the
style
and
makes
this
beer
very
smooth
the
alcohol
is
really
hidden
fairly
well
considering
how
high
an
alcohol
content
it
is
i
poured
into
a
nonic
glass
to
a
huge
tan
head
without
trying
it
is
copper
colored
with
suspended
yeast
the
aroma
is
sweet
spicy
and
loaded
with
booze
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
it
reminds
me
of
a
tripel
i
really
enjoy
the
spiciness
of
this
beer
it
does
help
mask
the
alcohol
which
is
present
but
not
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
viscous
just
the
way
i
like
it
the
alcohol
has
a
nice
warming
feel
to
it
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
a
chilly
autumn
evening
like
this
evening
or
a
cold
winter
day
poured
into
a
tulip
the
body
is
dark
mahogany
with
about
two
fingers
with
of
rocky
off
white
head
that
rapidly
dissipates
into
soapy
lacing
the
smell
is
rich
full
of
dark
fruits
caramel
yeast
and
alcohol
this
smells
really
sweet
it
reminds
me
of
blueberry
pie
for
some
reason
the
taste
is
dark
fruits
up
front
figs
and
dates
with
a
bready
feel
to
it
and
slight
traces
of
alcohol
the
body
is
held
up
nicely
with
sweet
malts
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
higher
than
i
expected
its
a
little
fizzier
in
my
mouth
than
what
i
had
anticipated
however
the
body
is
nice
and
heavy
and
not
as
syrupy
as
i
would
think
a
big
beer
like
this
would
be
all
things
considered
i
think
this
is
rather
drinkable
even
though
its
still
a
bit
of
a
sipper
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
it
will
destroy
anyone
who
drinks
too
much
i
dont
care
how
much
tolerance
you
think
you
have
drink
and
enjoy
with
nothing
but
respect
and
be
careful
it
goes
down
smooth
and
the
alcohol
will
catch
you
by
surprise
but
by
that
time
it
might
be
to
late
not
a
party
beer
but
celebration
drink
for
a
special
occasion
schneider
aventinus
weizeneisbock
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
maroon
dark
shade
of
some
color
thats
dark
almost
not
even
a
cap
of
sparse
bubbles
floating
on
top
no
stick
smell
is
all
clove
and
banana
and
some
deep
toasty
malts
really
cant
deserne
any
of
the
alcohol
it
is
hidden
almost
to
well
taste
is
all
in
the
bananers
that
are
dipped
in
caramel
and
slight
chocolates
as
well
clove
and
other
spices
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
in
taste
even
better
than
the
bottle
feel
is
above
medium
but
smooth
as
hell
out
the
wooden
cask
carb
is
not
so
high
but
the
character
is
cant
drink
to
much
of
this
stuff
but
it
is
still
a
great
beer
this
is
a
lovely
beer
its
surprising
just
how
gentle
it
is
for
all
its
extremity
it
really
stays
true
to
its
weizen
roots
which
give
it
a
lovely
roundness
and
temper
the
big
and
boozy
notes
that
appear
throughout
d
really
good
exspecially
given
the
abvs
really
nice
could
see
myself
drinking
a
bunch
more
as
the
weather
is
getting
colder
very
drinkable
i
love
this
beer
delicious
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
pretty
carbonated
in
the
mouth
its
sweet
but
not
cloying
its
very
malty
up
front
but
not
hot
at
all
ok
im
impressed
this
beer
is
quite
drinkble
for
the
12
in
fact
i
drink
it
before
it
hits
me
and
start
another
doppelbock
not
the
smartest
thing
ive
ever
done
its
smooth
and
has
a
great
finish
that
not
too
dry
there
is
no
aftertaste
and
its
a
great
drinking
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
drinkabilityother
than
the
12abv
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
md
the
body
is
nice
and
rich
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
the
drinkability
is
only
limited
by
your
capacity
to
handle
12
beer
for
an
entire
evening
a
brilliant
beer
with
lots
of
great
flavour
and
almost
perfectly
to
style
d
good
but
quite
strong
lovely
beer
after
all
schneider
quality
overall
quite
good
but
im
not
a
fan
of
clove
so
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
its
pops
like
the
weizenbock
feels
like
it
too
sits
on
the
border
of
dessert
and
gastronomy
beer
nose
of
bubble
gum
candy
rosemary
earth
pine
wheat
malt
of
mild
grit
and
acidic
beet
sugar
finish
of
banana
burnt
clove
and
sour
plum
incredible
better
than
the
littler
stuff
broader
yet
not
affecting
abv
outside
of
a
wonderful
warmth
in
the
throat
this
beer
pours
a
tawny
oak
with
a
massive
3
finger
explosion
of
beige
head
that
leaves
just
a
slight
bit
of
lacing
as
the
beer
disappears
from
my
glass
the
nose
is
like
a
concentrated
weizenbock
big
notes
of
banana
nut
bread
with
clove
and
cinnamon
a
slight
hint
of
bubble
gum
mixed
with
dates
it
really
is
a
classic
aroma
profile
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
wafts
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
the
flavor
profile
is
much
the
same
at
its
root
is
a
classic
weizenbock
with
squishy
brown
bananas
over
toasted
bread
clove
and
just
a
slight
nutty
flavor
brown
sugar
and
figs
intertwine
with
just
a
hint
of
its
12
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
masterfully
hid
something
i
wish
american
brewers
would
pay
more
attention
to
its
not
big
in
your
face
flavors
that
just
hide
the
alcohol
leaving
it
to
return
when
the
beer
warms
up
this
beer
has
intermingles
the
alcohol
letting
it
play
off
all
of
the
other
flavors
and
aromas
making
itself
into
a
big
boozy
banana
nut
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
you
expect
it
to
be
a
little
harsh
or
astringent
with
the
booze
but
this
is
mellow
and
creamy
smooth
this
is
a
great
beer
best
served
with
warm
fires
and
good
company
actually
i
was
surprised
at
how
easily
i
could
drink
this
granted
one
is
enough
but
i
drank
it
much
faster
than
any
other
12
ive
had
d
highly
recommended
very
drinkable
but
not
in
quantity
too
sweet
and
strong
this
is
a
great
selection
if
you
just
want
one
beer
anything
before
or
after
it
would
be
somehow
diminished
one
of
my
favourites
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
im
a
little
torn
on
drinkability
the
taste
is
outstanding
but
with
the
alcohol
barely
evident
it
would
be
an
interesting
session
beer
if
you
really
wanted
to
get
sloshed
but
not
real
often
terrific
unique
stuff
one
hell
of
a
brew
poured
chilled
into
a
wide
mouth
wine
glass
without
getting
near
the
glass
i
can
already
smell
alcohol
and
slight
sugary
malt
notes
no
head
and
the
hue
of
the
brew
is
a
murky
cola
color
upon
taking
a
proper
whiff
this
smells
like
a
strong
bock
beer
the
alcohol
isnt
cutting
through
as
much
as
i
thought
but
the
malt
certainly
is
i
smell
some
kind
of
fruit
dipped
in
alcohol
its
refreshing
and
pleasant
decent
amount
of
carbonation
cuts
through
my
pallet
notes
of
sugar
and
dark
fruit
are
present
with
an
alcoholic
after
taste
that
almost
reminds
of
of
cough
syrup
but
in
a
good
way
perfect
for
sipping
theres
more
carbonation
than
i
would
like
but
what
can
i
do
at
12
this
is
a
great
beer
to
take
your
time
with
youll
definitely
only
need
one
of
these
thick
cloudy
dark
brown
brew
no
light
passes
through
the
center
of
the
glass
and
only
a
glimmer
around
the
edges
this
even
though
the
glass
is
not
very
wide
thin
white
head
clings
heavily
nose
is
gigantically
thick
and
sweet
a
ton
of
dried
fig
and
raisin
then
banana
bread
nuts
taste
is
thick
syrupy
sweet
very
creamy
flavors
same
as
the
nose
it
is
cloyingly
sweet
but
what
do
you
expect
alcohol
is
mostly
hidden
but
still
felt
a
bit
theres
a
mixed
hop
bite
to
balance
the
sweetness
a
bit
but
it
doesnt
do
much
more
than
take
the
edge
off
of
it
some
peppery
alcohol
develops
as
it
warms
in
my
hand
huge
thick
sweet
very
tasty
and
very
filling
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
quite
easily
one
of
my
favorite
germans
well
worth
trying
a
classic
and
a
keeper
glad
i
found
a
bottle
in
the
fridge
try
it
hazy
apricot
brown
with
quickly
receding
sandy
head
with
the
nose
im
getting
clove
booze
rum
raisin
banana
and
some
bubblegum
taste
is
about
what
i
expected
exactly
like
a
concentrated
aventinus
im
sorry
to
say
however
that
in
this
case
making
the
beer
stronger
did
not
make
it
better
the
problem
is
that
some
of
the
subtleties
of
aventinue
now
have
to
wrestle
with
an
almost
overpowering
booze
note
it
comes
through
as
hot
even
though
this
bottle
is
probably
about
7
months
old
flavors
though
are
clove
banana
rum
raisin
and
toasted
malts
its
clean
and
nice
though
too
hot
prickly
feel
i
really
wish
this
was
a
bit
smoother
the
hotness
subsides
a
bit
as
the
drink
goes
on
but
still
give
me
regular
aventinus
very
drinkable
despite
the
heavy
malt
character
alcohol
exerts
itself
at
the
end
but
isnt
boozy
at
all
luscious
and
enjoyable
d
the
high
abv
and
the
rich
taste
makes
this
a
beer
that
you
need
to
take
your
time
to
enjoy
and
dont
drink
to
often
but
when
you
do
you
will
really
enjoy
it
drinkability
ive
always
been
curious
about
this
handsome
purple
bottle
glad
i
finally
pulled
the
trigger
its
rich
with
dark
fruits
earthy
yeast
and
spice
and
paired
with
the
fluffy
mouthfeel
it
makes
for
a
satisfying
beer
reviewed
from
my
notes
based
on
a
cask
pour
into
my
uprising
chalice
at
novare
res
schneider
event
the
beer
is
a
plain
brown
opaque
liquid
it
has
a
big
tan
foam
head
the
beer
is
too
dark
to
see
within
it
but
i
can
see
bubbles
popping
on
the
top
of
the
head
so
i
imagine
there
is
some
rising
carbonation
it
has
a
toasted
caramel
and
toffee
aroma
perhaps
a
better
way
to
explain
it
would
be
to
call
it
caramelized
sugar
there
are
alcohol
and
oak
notes
in
the
nose
as
well
its
very
appealing
this
si
a
strong
bready
beer
it
has
a
fine
wheat
taste
it
also
has
some
dark
fruit
flavors
like
plum
or
fig
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
and
alcohol
to
round
things
out
it
has
a
heavy
body
and
low
levels
of
carbonation
there
is
some
mouth
coat
but
it
is
not
excessive
there
is
a
good
burn
in
the
finish
as
one
would
expect
from
the
abv
overall
it
feels
like
an
intensified
beer
but
maybe
that
is
because
i
know
it
is
an
eisbock
considering
the
strength
of
this
one
it
is
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
order
too
many
rounds
but
i
could
certainly
enjoy
a
few
glasses
over
a
long
period
dont
let
the
abv
scare
you
off
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
is
worth
trying
dgood
beer
overall
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
seems
like
the
perfect
beer
to
cap
off
a
night
of
drinking
tasty
and
complex
not
an
easy
drinker
and
the
12
packs
a
wallop
d
drinkable
brew
but
one
that
should
be
sipped
rather
slowly
this
brew
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
wouldnt
seek
this
brew
out
again
happy
with
just
the
one
drinkability
given
the
abv
of
this
beer
it
is
rather
smooth
and
unabrasive
definitely
should
not
be
consumed
too
quickly
d
an
interesting
and
fascinating
beer
its
already
4yrs
old
but
it
could
hang
out
for
another
4
yrs
with
how
potent
this
bad
boy
is
malty
as
hell
with
a
good
sweetness
one
of
these
is
plenty
for
me
this
is
so
rich
and
filling
a
slow
sipper
definitely
d
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
that
one
must
bow
to
a
must
try
but
a
sipper
none
the
less
picked
this
up
based
on
the
recommendations
of
the
authors
of
the
naked
pint
so
glad
i
tried
it
outstanding
beer
smooth
warm
and
intense
all
at
the
same
time
appearance
dark
brown
reddish
very
little
head
or
lacing
feel
almost
syrupy
and
thick
maybe
slightly
viscous
but
the
alcohol
taste
pushes
through
so
its
not
overly
sickly
sweet
taste
cloves
bananas
malt
dark
fruits
definitely
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
not
in
an
obnoxious
way
smell
bananas
cloves
dark
fruit
drinkability
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
setting
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
but
ill
definitely
have
an
occasional
one
for
a
special
treat
o
very
rich
and
complex
never
had
a
beer
like
this
and
i
like
what
they
did
here
more
a
weizen
than
a
bock
to
be
sure
but
elements
enough
of
both
styles
to
be
worth
trying
a
very
dark
burnt
amber
color
with
a
thick
fizzy
off
white
head
a
fair
amount
of
sediment
stuck
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
which
is
pretty
tough
to
pull
up
and
adds
a
light
brown
haze
cloud
to
the
glass
smells
very
malty
and
grassy
with
a
fruity
alcohol
aroma
taste
is
great
malty
like
a
wheat
beer
and
malty
like
a
bock
a
sharp
oily
sting
covers
my
pallet
cheers
overall
this
brew
is
a
classic
and
is
wonderful
heavenly
outstanding
etc
if
you
can
age
a
few
bottles
do
it
ive
had
this
at
4
yrs
and
it
was
noticabley
better
overall
once
again
aventinus
is
the
true
king
of
beers
d
a
contemplative
effort
for
sipping
the
flavour
is
very
good
and
well
worth
the
price
for
fans
of
aventinus
d
considering
what
this
is
it
ends
up
being
a
very
nice
sipper
d
really
complex
beer
i
read
that
this
is
just
a
higher
abv
version
of
aventinus
weizenbock
but
i
must
say
i
dont
agree
the
complexity
is
awesome
making
for
a
really
enjoyable
beer
this
might
be
a
nice
nightcap
and
good
example
of
the
style
actually
a
weizeneisbock
not
a
lager
eisbock
but
i
think
id
rather
drink
normal
aventinus
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
especially
considering
its
monstrous
12
abv
i
am
really
enjoying
this
one
d
a
tasty
brew
for
me
and
you
this
is
a
decent
beer
by
all
means
the
alcohol
makes
itself
evident
in
the
belly
however
i
may
toss
a
few
of
these
away
to
see
what
it
does
but
its
by
no
means
bad
d
strong
this
is
a
sipper
but
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
pours
a
reddishbrown
colour
with
thick
offwhite
head
smells
of
cherries
and
heavy
malt
sweetness
i
can
notice
some
of
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
not
too
much
for
12
abv
this
hides
the
alcohol
ridiculously
well
it
tastes
of
cherries
and
brown
sugar
with
the
sweet
malt
it
is
quite
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
which
could
be
dangerous
at
this
abv
m
above
medium
body
tiny
bubbles
of
carboration
seek
out
and
buy
a
case
d
the
alcohol
content
is
rather
well
hidden
so
this
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
is
better
to
be
sipped
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
this
is
to
wheat
beer
what
westy
is
to
belgians
a
world
class
beer
all
the
way
around
drinkability
is
in
my
opinion
hampered
by
the
high
abv
but
to
be
expected
from
an
eisbock
if
youre
not
expecting
to
get
much
done
after
the
sitting
enjoy
a
few
bottles
im
going
to
hunt
for
a
few
more
of
this
delectable
libation
this
is
a
hearty
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
to
much
for
my
taste
it
will
take
me
a
while
to
finish
this
one
d
great
for
the
alcohol
content
i
could
have
several
it
wasnt
for
the
getting
me
too
drunk
factor
smooth
full
bodied
and
creamy
wow
this
has
a
great
mouthfeel
booze
definitely
hits
late
but
hard
has
a
very
warm
slide
down
the
throat
big
collaboration
of
honey
toffee
and
fruits
although
im
having
trouble
picking
out
the
exact
fruits
overall
through
the
syrup
like
texture
its
mostly
sweet
and
malty
no
real
bitterness
to
speak
of
and
definitely
a
great
eisbock
enjoying
a
rare
gravity
keg
aged
verison
of
this
beer
at
maxs
in
baltimore
it
pours
a
hazy
thick
light
chocolate
brown
body
and
off
white
creamy
head
smells
of
bananas
and
sour
funk
mostly
tastes
of
mild
malt
at
first
followed
by
sweet
banana
and
a
mellow
hint
of
alcohol
the
real
flavor
comes
at
the
end
where
the
sour
funk
and
acidity
hit
you
taste
buds
instead
of
hopps
the
funk
is
not
bad
though
think
of
a
mild
lambic
or
farmhouse
sasion
this
of
it
this
way
the
beer
still
has
balance
close
to
perfect
balance
when
you
concider
the
alcohol
and
sour
funk
flavors
goin
on
mouthfeel
is
smooth
from
the
natural
cask
drinkability
is
average
for
a
beer
of
this
style
this
is
a
pint
or
two
type
of
beer
not
an
all
nighter
drinkability
at
12
not
going
to
throw
back
5
or
six
of
these
plus
too
expensive
for
that
anyways
but
this
one
that
im
sitting
back
and
enjoying
is
truly
a
pleasure
you
wouldnt
know
that
this
beer
checks
in
at
12abv
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
viscous
really
syrupy
and
cloying
i
usually
dont
have
a
problem
with
that
if
the
beers
massiveness
can
balance
it
out
but
i
dont
get
that
here
d
are
you
kidding
palate
and
liver
killer
one
is
nice
though
d
nonsession
i
would
enjoy
having
this
beer
anytime
it
is
balanced
and
eisbocks
are
what
helped
get
me
into
the
game
of
craft
beer
mmm
such
nice
grape
flavors
and
complexities
seek
out
if
you
have
not
tried
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
redbrown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
tan
head
that
flows
like
a
waterfall
in
my
buds
pilsner
the
smell
is
sweet
prunes
and
lots
of
ruby
port
liquorice
alcohol
and
lots
of
plums
overwhelm
the
nose
with
a
sugary
sweetness
with
faint
backrounds
with
soft
english
malt
the
taste
starts
with
a
coating
grape
tartness
that
engulfs
the
mouth
in
a
syrup
like
manner
high
alcohol
warmth
banana
dark
rum
and
caramel
spices
probably
an
after
dinner
sipper
in
my
opinion
because
of
the
high
abv
heavy
mouthfeel
and
sugary
maltiness
but
still
a
great
treat
thanks
tippebrewcrew2
d
this
is
a
really
great
beer
i
put
some
bottles
in
my
cellar
i
think
it
will
be
even
better
in
a
couple
of
years
kinda
dirty
rusty
brown
color
with
a
pretty
thin
off
white
head
smells
of
raisins
alcohol
plums
and
banana
sweet
and
boozy
taste
is
much
the
same
except
that
i
get
some
clove
in
the
taste
that
was
missing
in
the
aroma
no
hop
presence
can
be
detected
lots
of
sweet
doughy
sugary
malts
this
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
nice
thickness
and
the
feel
is
quite
smooth
going
down
its
just
sweet
to
the
point
of
overkill
d
very
hot
beer
i
would
like
to
taste
this
one
with
a
few
years
on
it
fresh
though
one
is
plenty
for
me
drinkability
really
interesting
pretty
complex
flavors
and
smell
hot
though
the
boozy
solventy
aspects
get
to
be
a
little
much
a
good
one
to
share12
im
going
to
cellar
one
nice
head
on
this
one
with
strong
aroma
of
raisins
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
really
greatits
thick
like
a
cough
syrup
in
a
good
way
great
winey
aftertaste
too
doesnt
have
the
spice
and
clove
flavors
of
schneider
aventinus
but
it
tastes
like
a
condensed
version
of
that
beer
thick
and
glorious
this
beer
contains
so
much
that
it
needs
to
be
savored
by
its
own
d
this
is
fantastic
the
mixture
of
flavours
are
well
balanced
i
could
drink
this
plenty
of
times
tastes
like
the
non
eis
version
but
with
more
pronounced
flavours
and
hotter
d
a
very
interesting
brew
very
concentrated
and
bold
flavors
for
a
strong
and
potent
beer
this
was
very
drinkable
a
very
enjoyable
sipping
beer
overall
im
looking
forward
to
exploring
the
style
of
eisbock
after
this
one
my
only
complaint
was
that
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
almost
cloying
to
my
palate
i
thought
it
exhibited
some
very
complex
flavours
but
after
a
while
the
sweetness
was
just
overloading
my
buds
drinkability
best
with
a
meal
the
alcohol
gets
noticeable
after
awhile
but
it
doesnt
hurt
this
sipping
beer
i
think
it
like
the
original
better
but
this
was
an
enjoyable
brew
i
do
wonder
how
this
beer
would
have
been
if
i
had
gotten
more
of
the
sediment
in
but
if
the
whole
purpose
of
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
its
frozen
off
the
original
then
maybe
having
the
sediment
out
is
best
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
above
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
very
delicious
but
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
making
it
a
little
less
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
tasting
and
smelling
beer
it
could
have
had
a
little
better
head
retention
and
a
little
less
carbonation
in
my
opinion
but
still
an
excellent
beer
overall
impression
this
beer
is
essentially
a
concentrated
version
of
aventinus
weizenbock
the
flavor
is
intense
and
the
incredible
finish
just
keep
going
and
transforming
seriously
i
did
not
think
it
could
get
any
better
than
their
weizenbock
but
i
stand
corrected
hey
sometimes
it
feels
good
to
be
wrong
pours
a
very
deep
brown
color
completely
opaque
with
a
strong
medium
sized
brown
head
ill
probably
use
the
word
strong
quite
a
few
more
times
during
this
review
a
very
tight
nose
at
first
of
concentrated
malt
sweetness
slowly
opens
up
to
reveal
strong
notes
of
rich
raisonprune
fruits
alcohol
and
some
clovey
spice
not
even
the
slightest
off
aromatic
or
flavor
component
from
the
age
not
even
much
in
the
way
of
oxidation
actually
flavors
of
nutty
dark
bread
raison
plum
banana
cinnamon
sugar
and
tobacco
pretty
high
complexity
here
you
are
reminded
instantly
of
the
high
abv
very
warming
and
well
strong
excellent
stuff
however
extremely
well
made
and
pretty
drinkable
for
its
size
worth
trying
especially
with
some
age
on
it
i
am
really
kicking
myself
for
having
missed
this
on
cask
when
it
showed
up
in
the
area
personally
i
enjoy
this
version
over
the
standard
version
due
to
the
concentrated
taste
of
all
the
qualities
this
is
what
stands
out
the
most
for
me
prost
d
my
first
eisbock
and
a
very
nice
classic
german
brew
exactly
what
i
wanted
this
style
is
definitely
a
close
cousin
of
the
weizenbock
but
its
a
little
less
robust
due
to
it
being
a
lager
a
good
spicey
brew
for
a
nice
autumn
winter
day
a
classic
which
deserves
a
reco
ages
as
well
as
any
barleywine
and
provides
an
excellent
alternative
for
slow
sipping
this
is
a
strong
beer
in
every
sense
smell
taste
and
abv
so
intense
and
delicious
ive
tried
this
backtoback
with
regular
aventinus
and
remember
preferring
the
original
though
this
is
still
an
awesome
brew
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
cheers
da
very
huge
tasting
beer
but
this
beer
is
orgasmically
delicious
very
drinkable
minus
the
abv
which
is
the
only
deterent
i
personally
wouldnt
mind
taking
the
risk
if
i
was
able
to
buy
cases
of
it
at
a
time
i
highly
recommend
you
try
it
drinkability
i
like
other
eisbocks
i
have
tried
better
i
do
like
the
banana
and
lat
flavor
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
harsh
here
for
me
to
want
another
very
boozy
and
complex
but
just
a
bit
much
for
me
a
beer
to
be
reckoned
with
500ml
of
12
beer
can
take
you
for
a
whirl
part
way
through
the
pint
you
notice
the
warming
a
nightcap
for
sure
and
with
the
high
level
of
sweetness
im
not
sure
if
i
can
really
rate
it
very
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
i
imagine
some
time
in
the
cellar
would
smooth
this
one
out
a
bit
41010
edit
so
lucky
to
be
here
at
maxs
for
their
last
gravity
fed
keg
of
this
nectar
this
particular
keg
is
very
fresh
and
the
head
retention
is
spectacular
its
a
creamy
milky
looking
head
looking
more
akin
to
the
foam
on
a
latte
lacing
is
likewise
very
nice
considering
this
was
gravity
fed
i
was
greatly
impressed
by
this
beers
appearance
always
an
excellent
beer
out
of
gravity
feed
keg
its
nearly
mindblowing
d
decent
the
alcohol
isnt
all
that
well
hidden
after
having
this
a
second
time
i
like
it
a
bit
less
than
the
first
time
not
something
ill
actively
seek
out
again
really
enjoyable
but
whoa
between
the
sugars
the
abv
i
kind
of
wish
id
split
even
this
12
oz
bottle
with
someone
drinkability
very
inviting
and
rewarding
when
you
sip
slowly
to
enjoy
the
complexities
a
testament
to
what
can
be
accomplished
through
the
brewers
art
victory
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
and
one
id
recommend
to
those
who
for
some
reason
think
wheat
beer
is
girly
this
stuff
is
good
when
used
as
jet
fuel
but
excellent
when
used
as
beer
im
only
14
of
the
way
done
with
my
glass
and
i
am
already
feeling
it
i
dont
see
myself
picking
this
up
regularly
but
as
a
one
off
when
im
in
the
mood
it
is
right
on
target
i
dont
know
what
to
say
this
beer
is
intense
making
it
difficult
for
me
to
fully
embrace
it
yet
its
rough
character
and
unique
taste
are
well
matched
to
the
12
alcohol
content
i
beleive
i
would
try
this
beer
again
perhaps
in
a
different
glass
a
nicely
soupedup
version
of
the
regular
aventinus
but
i
really
dont
think
its
as
wellrounded
as
the
regular
weisse
or
aventinus
its
a
lot
more
intense
in
flavour
but
becomes
boozy
to
quickly
and
seems
too
brash
and
rough
in
comparison
to
its
lighter
brethren
and
more
refined
eisbocks
like
kulmbachers
i
first
experienced
this
beer
at
the
schneider
haus
in
munich
in
06
and
then
bought
2
cases
of
it
at
the
specs
warehouse
in
houston
tx
upon
my
return
finding
and
experiencing
the
delectability
of
the
eisbock
remains
one
of
the
highlights
of
my
beerdrinking
life
im
a
little
curious
as
to
why
it
wasnt
ranked
in
the
top
100
though
poured
a
deep
reddish
mahogany
from
the
cask
into
a
12oz
tulip
smells
of
spicy
banana
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
bottled
version
with
the
alcohol
being
a
little
more
apparent
which
could
just
be
a
temperature
issue
lots
of
banana
and
spice
for
12
this
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
abv
is
noticeable
but
not
unpleasant
i
feel
very
lucky
to
have
this
on
cask
top
notch
wheat
beer
from
schneider
as
usual
will
give
this
one
another
goaround
at
a
later
point
in
time
to
see
how
my
palate
has
changed
and
if
the
alcohol
will
still
try
to
punch
it
into
submission
grabbed
this
one
cause
ive
loved
the
aventinus
weizenbock
every
time
ive
had
it
this
was
as
advertised
just
a
bigger
stronger
version
of
that
deep
maroonamber
color
with
a
small
head
and
a
touch
of
lacing
huge
syrupy
brew
lots
of
fruit
molasses
caramel
and
maybe
a
whiff
of
hops
overall
it
was
good
but
maybe
in
the
liqueur
department
more
than
the
beer
department
id
definitely
have
it
again
but
it
was
just
a
little
too
much
so
ill
probably
stick
to
the
normal
weizenbock
when
im
buying
on
a
side
note
i
didnt
finish
the

a

with
a

day
for
once
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
it
was
nice
to
take
some
time
and
appreciate
this
monster
for
what
it
is
meant
to
be
drunk
on
cool
days
and
warm
you
up
the
alcohol
isnt
masked
so
its
easy
not
to
overdo
it
i
suppose
edit
had
another
fresher
one
and
the
appearance
and
smell
were
fabulous
it
is
great
either
way
aged
or
not
for
a

this
is

youll

get
by
the
time
youre
done
with
it
ill
buy
some
more
and
plan
to
cellar
this
one
im
amazed
that
aventinus
weizen
eisbock
is
only
the
third
beer
of
this
style
that
ive
ever
reviewed
while
it
isnt
a
sock
knockeroffer
like
kuhnhenn
raspberry
eisbock
its
a
damn
good
beer
that
is
fun
to
sip
and
savor
its
also
widely
available
and
cellars
well
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
again
had
beer
at
beer
fest
in
seattle
poured
into
four
ounce
glass
it
was
poured
out
of
a
pitcher
i
am
not
sure
why
it
was
in
a
pitcher
and
didnt
come
out
of
a
tap
or
a
bottle
it
felt
a
little
flat
didnt
have
a
bad
mouth
feel
but
it
wasnt
really
one
that
i
totally
appreciated
i
liked
the
taste
it
had
a
good
taste
from
what
i
could
tell
perhaps
i
should
try
it
in
the
bottle
form
from
the
local
place
and
give
it
another
look
i
will
look
for
this
at
world
market
in
the
future
very
pleasant
winters
beer
brought
back
from
a
berlin
beer
trip
glad
i
found
it
d
the
only
downside
because
it
is
very
substantial
and
you
will
feel
the
alcohol
a
150ml
bottle
would
be
optimal
drinkability
is
this
ones
only
weak
point
the
flavors
are
rich
and
intense
and
the
alcohol
has
a
potent
bite
to
it
that
makes
this
one
a
fantastic
sipper
that
should
be
treated
with
care
and
caution
hardly
any
carbonation
but
just
enough
to
scrub
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
is
like
a
tasty
port
but
with
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
of
a
good
beer
the
clean
finish
and
lack
of
high
complexity
make
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable
i
keep
wanting
more
after
each
sip
this
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
big
fizzy
head
that
quickly
disappears
into
nothing
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
the
bottom
of
the
glass
has
small
chunks
of
yeast
that
would
of
been
larger
had
i
not
swirled
the
the
last
few
ounces
before
pouring
the
smell
has
a
medicinal
aroma
with
ester
and
alcohol
tastes
of
smooth
and
creamy
malt
flavors
with
clove
cinnamon
and
banana
the
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
with
lots
of
carbination
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
although
i
could
not
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
due
to
the
high
abv
and
price
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
but
1
will
be
plenty
for
me
for
a
few
months
drinkability
very
good
drinkability
but
the
alcohol
is
too
high
to
be
a
session
beer
i
could
not
drink
many
in
a
sitting
but
i
will
definitely
return
perhaps
i
would
argue
this
beer
is
most
suitable
for
the
winter
months
i
could
imagine
being
housebound
with
only
a
few
bottles
of
this
strong
stuff
with
a
the
blizzard
roaring
outside
and
not
a
care
in
world
on
the
other
hand
this
beer
does
just
fine
on
this
rainy
june
day
this
is
one
expensive
ass
11
2
oz
bottle
never
had
an
eisbock
so
here
was
my
chance
was
slighly
flustered
by
the
fractured
looking
yeast
cake
that
made
it
into
my
bottle
was
thinking
infection
this
one
must
have
been
in
the
warehouse
a
while
the
cap
left
rust
dents
on
the
bottle
lip
anyways
after
checking
to
see
if
this
was
normal
and
i
wasnt
going
to
die
damn
this
is
one
heavy
beer
i
was
slightly
buzzed
earlier
in
the
day
but
this
brought
me
right
on
back
heavy
in
every
taste
imaginable
although
not
hoppy
very
syrupy
and
boozy
which
is
the
point
you
can
still
taste
the
wheat
through
it
all
impressive
beer
but
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
i
love
me
some
big
beers
and
maybe
i
just
didnt
want
to
get
drunk
but
you
wouldnt
taste
a
bud
light
for
5
hours
after
having
this
or
want
to
d
pretty
tasty
but
also
very
serious
at
12
a
little
goes
a
long
way
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
some
age
on
it
as
the
alcohol
burn
would
certainly
subside
a
bit
weizeneisbock
is
good
beer
theres
no
question
about
that
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
it
has
a
nice
deep
flavor
and
is
solid
allaround
the
high
abv
is
the
obvious
thing
that
holds
it
back
its
just
too
much
and
hurts
the
overall
experience
to
a
degree
personally
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
tremendous
success
at
9
or
10
and
would
still
fit
within
the
eisbock
style
guidelines
as
it
is
its
just
a
little
too
boozy
and
warm
having
said
that
the
flavor
still
manages
to
succeed
its
an
easy
recommendation
but
i
can
see
it
being
a
little
better
with
a
tweak
or
two
a
halfliter
bottle
poured
into
my
standard
snifter
appears
a
rich
dark
crimson
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
off
white
head
the
foam
ebbs
within
seconds
settling
to
a
very
thin
layer
nose
and
flavor
are
of
caramelized
bananas
figs
raisins
cherries
brown
sugar
chocolate
and
cloves
rich
syrupy
and
full
bodied
with
light
but
ample
carbonation
for
the
style
tasty
stuff
worth
seeking
out
a
masterpiece
of
brewing
i
will
remember
this
in
old
age
and
smile
theres
more
carbination
then
i
would
have
guessed
the
beer
jumps
all
over
your
mouth
i
get
some
dark
fruit
flavors
date
maybe
definetly
a
spicey
characteristic
as
well
cloves
pepper
and
tobacco
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
highly
drinkable
at
something
like
12
it
has
a
syrupy
after
feel
but
one
is
rewarded
with
each
new
sip
bottle
from
2005
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
it
has
a
strong
smell
of
alcohol
and
clove
and
secondary
smells
of
soy
sauce
and
cheese
wasnt
thrilled
about
the
soy
sauce
and
cheese
aspects
tastes
of
pepper
spice
clove
and
banana
and
bubblegum
overall
impression
not
a
very
often
seen
style
easily
drinkable
but
the
with
the
level
of
alcohol
and
the
flavors
not
being
as
prominent
it
would
not
be
something
that
i
would
regularly
search
out
fairly
biased
to
the
sweet
side
but
easily
drinkable
only
gives
off
a
hint
of
the
12
alcohol
d
not
a
multi
beer
kind
of
beer
one
is
the
right
amount
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
one
complex
and
strong
d
its
an
interesting
idea
but
in
the
end
it
was
way
too
big
for
me
i
didnt
come
close
to
finishing
the
bottle
if
im
going
to
have
this
in
the
future
im
going
to
have
to
split
it
with
three
or
four
people
this
is
a
big
big
beer
it
falls
short
of
its
little
brother
the
regular
aventinus
being
less
drinkable
but
no
more
complex
still
a
great
beer
and
one
i
will
be
drinking
again
d
not
the
most
drinkable
extra
strong
beer
but
it
is
drinkable
enough
provided
you
dont
have
more
than
a
bottle
at
once
maybe
1
52
max
very
thin
head
that
settled
to
an
island
in
the
middle
of
my
le
merle
goblet
tastes
of
dried
pomegranate
with
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
banana
and
dried
fruit
up
front
sweet
with
a
slight
sour
aftertaste
and
alot
of
maltisweetness
a
unique
ale
that
i
would
have
again
but
definately
after
a
meal
and
perhaps
paired
with
a
rich
dark
chocolate
desert
i
finished
this
beer
and
enjoyed
it
to
the
end
but
it
had
a
pretty
strong
and
lingering
effect
on
me
well
after
it
was
gone
approach
this
one
with
respect
drinkability
at
12
abv
there
will
only
be
one
a
night
of
these
but
each
sip
is
smooth
sweet
and
leads
on
to
another
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
spreads
gradually
but
is
soon
felt
good
drinkability
marks
it
went
down
easily
and
without
any
argument
from
me
i
later
got
some
more
to
use
in
a
chili
i
was
making
d
very
drinkable
for
its
12
abv
however
youd
be
well
advised
not
to
have
too
many
awesome
beer
d
not
an
everyday
drink
but
great
for
a
nightcap
after
a
heavy
meal
a
must
have
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
all
in
all
this
beer
is
a
musttry
for
any
fan
of
aventinus
and
for
90
of
wheat
beer
fans
in
general
highly
recommended
if
not
required
beer
poured
a
burgundy
brown
with
no
head
very
thick
beer
as
light
does
not
pass
thru
nose
is
heavy
on
the
dark
fruits
very
wine
like
taste
is
plums
and
currants
finishing
with
light
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
pretty
smooth
with
no
carbonation
drinkability
is
dangerously
good
alcohol
is
not
present
when
sipping
but
i
am
gradually
warming
as
i
partake
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
that
must
be
tried
if
you
are
a
wine
and
beer
lover
notes
this
beer
is
big
bold
and
beautiful
the
is
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
it
is
fairly
strong
in
alcohol
and
taste
which
limits
it
to
a
certain
extent
if
you
like
dopplebocks
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
and
enjoying
d
a
bit
of
a
sipper
very
good
wouldnt
typically
expect
these
flavors
coming
from
a
lager
age
probably
served
this
well
love
me
a
big
bold
boozy
beer
but
there
are
times
when
the
alcohol
overwhelms
and
when
it
is
incorporated
for
the
good
of
the
overall
flavor
this
veers
toward
overwhelming
though
isnt
at
all
unenjoyable
just
a
bit
hot
and
probably
wouldve
been
10
times
better
if
the
alcohol
was
a
mere
9
or
so
the
normal
aventinus
is
great
and
this
is
a
concentraded
version
if
it
cant
go
wrong
with
that
very
good
stuff
d
this
drank
way
too
easily
for
having
a
12
abv
great
beer
and
i
will
definitely
drink
again
pours
very
dark
brown
with
just
a
slight
head
forming
on
the
pour
smell
is
very
dark
malts
and
dark
fruits
flavor
is
huge
incredible
mouthfeel
more
dark
fruits
and
a
very
good
weizen
taste
very
little
if
any
sign
of
the
high
abv
in
the
taste
maybe
just
a
little
heat
but
thats
hard
to
notice
goes
down
way
too
easy
for
a
beer
this
big
tastes
great
and
doesnt
get
old
at
all
very
complex
very
big
very
good
beer
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
its
decently
thick
not
a
bad
beer
but
frankly
its
like
they
took
the
normal
version
and
in
trying
to
intensify
it
made
it
worse
too
boozy
velvety
smooth
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
wheatstyle
beers
ive
had
i
couldnt
imagin
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
very
filling
almost
like
a
meal
in
itself
not
to
mention
the
high
alcohol
content
overall
a
great
drinkable
and
enjoyable
sipper
id
like
the
alcohol
to
be
a
hidden
a
little
better
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
quality
of
this
one
definitely
one
to
seek
out
and
try
recommended
mixed
in
the
taste
i
pick
up
cherries
chocolate
grapes
root
beer
maybe
some
other
fruit
in
there
as
well
very
complex
and
interesting
alcohol
is
not
very
noticeable
and
hidden
well
i
havent
really
had
too
many
of
these
stronger
wheat
beers
before
but
this
one
is
pretty
damn
good
ill
definitely
check
out
more
in
the
future
pours
a
dark
garnet
brown
and
rust
juice
color
no
head
and
there
is
no
way
to
see
any
bubbling
in
this
beer
even
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
the
aroma
makes
me
think
of
a
bozey
cooked
fruit
pie
filling
cherrie
in
a
can
that
have
been
cooked
slow
stove
top
in
cognac
very
dark
fruity
and
roasted
flavors
dark
cherries
taste
like
theyve
been
roasted
in
the
oven
in
some
sherry
or
maybe
even
port
wine
viey
tastes
and
palate
mix
with
a
well
tempered
alcoholic
warmth
and
dark
fruits
great
sipping
beer
perfect
digestive
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
props
to
henry
for
expanding
our
horizon
with
this
beer
at
our
tasting
pours
brown
with
a
nice
sizable
head
that
fades
to
a
clean
lace
smell
is
very
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
with
subtle
flowery
notes
much
more
complex
than
other
double
bocks
with
a
sip
there
is
an
instant
flood
of
flavor
wow
roasted
toffee
and
sweetness
classic
for
the
style
the
yeast
is
detectable
and
adds
a
variation
to
the
sweetness
however
if
you
weed
through
the
huge
thick
sweetness
you
can
find
a
very
deep
ripe
fruit
dark
raisins
and
sugary
plumb
lending
to
the
beers
sophistication
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
and
only
shows
after
the
glass
has
warmed
and
my
taste
buds
have
acclimated
but
even
then
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
taste
the
complexity
of
this
beer
really
stands
out
among
its
brothers
of
similar
style
very
good
beer
this
is
just
too
good
thanks
a
lot
rob
for
this
tasty
bottle
too
easy
to
drink
tempting
to
chug
it
down
but
good
thing
i
didnt
since
im
already
feeling
it
well
before
the
end
could
get
into
trouble
with
these
pretty
easily
i
dont
think
this
beats
samiclaus
in
the
beefed
up
doppelbock
category
i
wanted
it
to
be
something
else
not
super
complex
i
wonder
if
i
had
decanted
this
one
whether
i
would
have
liked
it
better
it
wasnt
quite
the
malt
bomb
i
hoped
for
no
regrets
though
very
good
beer
would
like
to
try
again
could
drink
more
than
one
but
probably
not
a
good
idea
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
reddish
color
light
tannish
head
diminishing
flowery
aroma
malty
hoppy
but
very
flowery
some
alcohol
flowery
taste
some
alcohol
and
fizzyness
very
good
tastes
a
lot
like
a
belgian
triple
or
strong
ale
dangerously
drinkable
numbered
batch
bottles
so
there
may
be
variations
from
batch
to
batch
but
worth
a
try
to
the
advanced
beer
drinker
d
good
i
doubt
ill
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
will
be
buying
this
again
poured
into
a
snifter
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
fell
quickly
leaving
behind
zero
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
smokey
some
raisins
and
mustiness
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
comes
through
as
it
warms
hints
of
banana
and
spice
with
some
earthy
funky
yeast
it
almost
has
bsda
nose
to
it
flavor
is
quite
strong
notes
of
grapes
apples
bubble
gum
rum
soaked
dark
fruits
yeast
and
spice
lots
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
and
the
subsequent
burn
on
the
way
down
it
tastes
pretty
good
but
the
alcohol
is
just
a
bit
too
much
for
me
d
insidiously
hides
the
towering
abv
i
would
drink
several
of
these
in
a
night
before
i
start
being
a
little
too
honest
with
my
friends
and
only
then
realize
the
predicament
i
was
in
d
this
is
a
big
beautiful
beer
though
it
wasnt
much
to
look
at
the
concentration
of
flavors
was
incredible
even
the
huge
abv
is
pretty
well
concealed
making
this
more
drinkable
than
it
should
be
im
guessing
it
might
be
a
tad
expensive6
but
its
a
great
example
of
why
ill
be
buried
with
a
bottle
of
a
schneider
beer
in
my
right
hand
and
a
brewdog
in
my
left
overall
its
a
very
nice
sweet
sipping
drink
not
too
heavy
and
the
abv
givs
a
boozey
warmth
which
is
detectable
when
it
warms
a
bit
towards
room
temp
all
around
very
nice
this
doesnt
have
the
toasty
bread
sweet
malt
and
rich
dark
caramel
qualities
of
a
normal
eisbock
it
does
however
share
the
fluffy
creamy
fullness
and
dark
spicy
fruity
nearly
refreshing
character
of
dunkelweizen
and
that
makes
for
a
dangerous
drinkability
this
is
presented
as
the
original
eisbock
and
while
i
cant
confirm
that
i
can
say
that
it
is
still
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
wheat
based
or
not
that
ive
yet
to
try
i
poured
from
a
11
2
ounce
glass
into
a
hefeweizen
glass
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
quickly
the
aroma
is
phenols
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
deep
molases
medicinal
herbs
and
an
overriding
note
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
lingers
in
the
finish
the
beer
has
a
full
bodied
chewy
mouth
feel
with
its
well
hidden
12
abv
the
brew
is
a
sipper
a
very
good
beer
that
was
nothing
like
i
expected
future
outlook
not
stylistically
one
of
my
favorites
but
a
nice
interesting
change
of
pace
i
might
get
this
one
again
to
serve
the
same
purpose
sometime
down
the
road
best
before
date
may
be
the
238th
day
of
2008
in
which
case
this
would
be
a
bit
late
poured
into
a
snifter
its
particulate
and
dark
brown
with
fluffy
pale
tan
head
i
get
a
very
sweet
smell
apricot
maybe
with
just
a
bit
of
skunk
yeasty
and
alcoholic
i
taste
immediate
toasty
bitterness
quickly
mellowing
with
caramel
sweetness
its
pretty
full
bodied
carbonation
still
holding
up
with
warmth
im
not
sure
ive
ever
had
a
wheat
dopple
bock
before
its
warming
and
sweet
although
i
would
not
say
approachable
a
delicious
darker
brew
for
the
adventuresome
palate
same
as
smell
starts
off
very
and
ends
with
subtle
and
nice
bitterness
that
is
very
pleasing
i
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
have
a
session
with
this
beer
a
good
beer
that
i
would
gladly
purchase
and
push
on
others
to
consume
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
in
the
future
that
is
for
sure
this
is
a
beer
that
will
knock
you
on
your
butt
if
you
arent
paying
attention
to
that
high
abv
poured
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
big
head
and
lively
carbonation
head
dissipated
to
a
thin
covering
as
i
nursed
this
badboy
smelled
the
typical
weizen
aromas
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
or
raisins
you
get
the
same
thing
in
the
taste
and
get
some
real
sweetness
with
the
kick
of
alcohol
i
could
feel
the
alcohol
more
as
the
beer
warmed
while
i
nursed
it
this
eisbock
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
that
has
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
feel
to
it
this
weizeneisbock
hides
the
alcohol
well
though
i
still
know
it
is
there
and
therfore
one
in
a
sitting
is
more
than
enough
for
me
d
amazingly
decent
much
better
than
the
massive
abv
might
suggest
notes
this
is
an
incredibly
deceptive
beer
the
taste
belies
the
strong
alcohol
percentage
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
enjoyed
to
this
point
the
head
retention
is
short
but
the
aroma
is
great
a
bit
boozy
sweet
malt
yeasty
dark
fruits
chocolate
a
bit
more
banana
bread
and
clove
maybe
the
finish
has
less
citrus
i
think
very
smooth
man
do
i
love
this
beer
just
when
you
thought
aventinus
couldnt
get
any
better
they
went
and
froze
the
sucker
who
needs
water
anyway
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
good
head
from
a
steady
pour
no
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
is
of
ripe
plums
raisins
sweet
malt
cinnamon
blueberries
and
a
very
little
bit
of
alcohol
thick
and
mouthcoating
pulling
back
just
short
of
syrupy
flavor
is
of
bruised
plums
braised
pears
raisins
and
sweet
red
apples
finish
is
sweet
and
lingering
and
warms
as
it
goes
down
i
would
never
in
a
million
years
have
guessed
this
was
a
12
beer
excellent
brew

overall
this
is
powerful
i
mean
whew
ive
had
some
belgian
12s
but
the
alcohol
wasnt
nearly
as
noticeable
this
seems
like
itd
do
a
pretty
good
job
cleaning
engines
or
killing
brain
cells
catch
the
reference
pretty
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
beasts
pours
dirty
brown
with
lots
of
floaties
and
clouds
strong
offwhite
head
that
lasts
banana
bread
cane
sugar
yeast
nutmeg
cinnamon
clove
and
cake
batter
fill
the
nose
rich
full
mouthfeel
and
taste
great
balance
between
the
wheat
and
banana
yeast
esters
and
spice
a
great
winter
beer
as
my
beer
taste
refines
i
like
to
try
new
things
enter
aventinus
as
recommended
by
some
friends
pours
with
more
carbonation
but
settles
out
quickly
the
nose
is
a
bit
yeasty
but
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
full
and
immediate
the
cloudy
chocolate
brown
presentation
some
find
a
bit
imposing
but
after
a
taste
i
find
myself
willing
to
want
another
the
taste
is
smooth
and
exotic
so
many
flavors
come
across
the
palate
that
i
find
my
taster
confused
but
very
pleased
it
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
the
flavors
but
raisins
and
a
bit
of
beechwood
come
to
mind
as
i
recall
my
dad
breaking
a
branch
to
allow
me
to
smell
and
taste
the
unique
beechwood
flavor
this
is
one
german
brew
that
comes
up
tasting
like
the
monks
of
belgium
had
a
hand
in
the
recipe
this
brew
is
outstanding
it
has
some
sweetness
about
it
but
not
like
the
christmas
brews
it
is
certainly
worth
a
taste
especially
if
you
enjoy
the
belgian
brews
d
a
real
intoxicating
treat
could
easily
go
in
place
of
a
cordial
d
i
struggled
a
little
with
the
11
2
ounce
bottle
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
but
ill
go
back
to
the
original
pours
a
dar
clougy
brown
with
very
small
beige
head
aroma
of
wheat
chocolate
plum
raisin
and
alcohol
stronger
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
than
regular
aventinus
tastes
of
raisin
plum
and
blackberry
nice
warm
alcohol
presence
d
good
drinkability
for
an
eisbock
the
extremely
alcoholic
presence
detracts
a
little
bit
i
wonder
if
cellaring
would
help
it
mellow
at
all
sounds
like
time
for
an
experiment
d
for
a
12
beer
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
cant
say
i
would
have
more
than
one
but
it
does
go
down
pretty
nicely
healthy
body
with
dialed
carbonation
give
a
smooth
mouthfell
with
a
bit
of
tingle
on
the
tongue
in
the
dry
finish
a
very
easy
drinker
for
this
rather
big
beer
highly
recommended
also
of
noteglassware
truly
makes
a
difference
with
this
beer
my
first
time
i
had
it
in
the
traditional
chilled
aventinus
glass
and
the
second
time
was
in
a
standard
chilled
pint
glass
to
get
the
full
bouquet
and
flavor
experience
you
need
the
traditional
glassware
this
one
keeps
me
coming
back
for
another
sip
sure
it
is
strong
i
want
more
drinkability
suffers
for
obvious
reasons
as
the
abv
is
quite
high
and
leaves
a
good
buzz
afterward
the
flavors
though
call
for
more
even
with
the
definite
booziness
of
the
beer
it
is
overall
a
very
balanced
brew
and
probably
of
the
mostif
not
the
mostenjoyable
weizens
i
have
ever
enjoyed
drinkability
sip
savor
repeat
recommend
super
sweet
and
grotesquely
unbalanced
in
a
rich
dessert
kinda
way
the
abv
is
blended
in
rather
well
delightful
umami
good
beer
to
enjoy
at
a
leisurely
pace
and
would
definitely
buy
again
even
for
a
weizenbock
i
was
still
very
suprised
about
the
large
amount
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
maybe
i
got
one
of
the
end
of
the
barrels
give
this
a
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
this
is
my
first
eisbock
on
tap
and
it
was
well
worth
it
went
great
with
the
pizza
i
was
eating
recommended
d
sip
this
bad
boy
and
enjoy
the
full
flavored
compelexity
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
given
the
right
situation
i
cant
believe
this
is
derived
from
aventinus
i
enjoyed
this
version
so
much
more
and
it
was
oozing
with
flavor
for
my
first
of
the
style
maybe
im
rating
it
quite
high
with
nothing
to
compare
to
but
it
deserves
it
i
arrived
home
and
poured
the
eisbock
into
a
goblet
it
was
as
the
phantom
said
tremulous
and
tender
hard
as
lighting
and
soft
as
candlelight
such
succulent
sweetness
as
if
an
entire
school
of
fish
of
were
traversing
across
my
tongue
cascading
myriad
flavours
to
the
fathoms
below
sweetnes
unfolding
into
tartness
fading
away
into
absolute
savoury
perfection
such
a
relief
of
thirst
and
such
a
fire
of
warmth
i
need
fear
not
a
single
winters
night
in
the
valiant
arms
of
this
faithful
libation
how
delightful
is
it
to
know
that
the
nectar
of
the
gods
exists
and
that
you
have
dared
to
drink
of
its
delectable
deliciousness
a
strong
beer
that
looks
like
a
barleywine
and
tastes
like
a
barleywine
mixed
with
wheat
not
to
be
repetitive
but
this
beer
is
a
lot
like
a
good
barleywine
its
a
bit
sticky
and
a
bit
heavy
on
the
alcohol
but
the
flavor
and
smell
are
excellent
its
sweet
spicy
malty
and
full
of
barley
and
wheat
theres
a
lot
of
fruitiness
mostly
raisin
the
full
rich
flavors
and
smooth
feel
hide
the
alcohol
as
well
as
can
be
asked
at
12
abv
i
love
aventinus
and
this
beer
is
a
bit
like
a
barleywine
version
of
it
that
might
be
hard
to
imagine
but
its
a
great
big
strong
beer
that
you
can
sip
like
a
fine
port
dont
let
the
drinkability
score
fool
you
its
good
for
what
it
is
but
im
not
going
to
give
it
a
high
score
just
because
ive
never
had
another
eisbock
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
beer
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
taste
but
a
lot
of
them
balance
each
other
out
that
allows
one
to
keep
drinking
this
is
a
great
beer
that
ends
with
a
very
warm
feeling
in
my
tummy
great
beer
to
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
night
d
easy
does
it
and
a
little
intense
but
thats
to
be
expected
excellent
as
long
as
its
taken
slow
d
i
liked
the
idea
of
a
stronger
flavored
aventinus
but
this
had
just
too
much
noticeable
alcohol
and
felt
like
i
was
sipping
a
glass
of
hard
liquor
maybe
this
style
just
isnt
for
me
one
bottle
was
just
about
more
than
i
could
stand
d
this
is
a
big
beer
and
all
you
need
is
one
it
is
absolutely
a
sipper
meant
to
savored
and
enjoyed
dont
rush
this
one
for
sure
very
solid
in
taste
and
flavors
i
will
definitely
keep
some
in
the
cellar
this
beer
has
tons
and
tons
of
different
smells
fruit
flower
hops
cloves
and
very
well
rounded
all
of
the
smells
turn
into
tastes
when
you
drink
it
there
are
aftertastes
of
the
alcohol
and
a
smoothness
feel
definitely
have
another
to
drink
upon
reading
other
reviews
it
seems
that
something
was
off
i
had
zero
caronation
and
no
yeast
d
while
too
sweet
quite
enjoyable
and
refreshing
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
again
soon
this
is
very
port
like
if
you
want
to
impress
some
wine
people
bring
this
very
interesting
and
unique
something
to
sip
and
savor
when
the
cold
winds
moan
outside
drinkability
is
fairly
moderate
flavor
is
alright
but
alcohol
is
quite
high
really
limits
the
beer
taste
is
a
malt
fest
dried
fruit
is
a
little
more
pronounced
than
the
smell
leaning
towards
raisins
slightly
viscous
with
good
carbonation
and
alcohol
warming
one
of
these
is
enough
for
me
overall
very
impressed
overall
very
drinkable
id
probably
have
this
one
with
a
nice
hearty
steak
the
next
time
md
a
full
bodied
syrupy
feel
throughout
carbonation
seems
to
keep
it
very
active
in
your
mouth
as
well
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
very
high
abv
that
is
very
well
hidden
d
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
the
super
high
abv
and
price
limit
its
drinkability
still
im
down
for
enjoying
one
every
once
in
a
while
and
when
i
do
i
usually
enjoy
it
a
fair
bit
give
it
a
shot
imo
dability
12
abv
and
drinkabilty
generally
dont
go
together
but
this
goes
down
nicely
overall
wow
followed
by
wide
eyes
and
a
huge
smile
that
was
literally
my
first
reaction
to
this
when
i
opened
the
bottle
and
smelled
its
contents
my
gf
can
attest
to
this
my
nose
was
quite
happy
from
the
beautiful
sweet
aromas
wafting
to
it
from
the
tulip
glass
and
my
tastebuds
became
quite
ecstatic
from
the
tastes
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
can
certainly
kick
you
in
the
ass
candy
currant
buns
figs
and
a
shot
of
brandy
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
jw
lees
vintage
harvest
ale
but
a
2007
bottle
isnt
as
ripe
im
going
to
have
to
buy
a
few
more
to
age
for
5
years
or
so
lovely
a
beautiful
sipper
i
would
like
some
belgian
dark
chocolate
to
accompany
this
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
one
if
you
see
it
drinkability
12
abv
thats
pretty
high
but
every
last
point
is
worth
it
for
this
delicious
bastard
of
a
beer
incredibly
complex
tasting
and
smelling
smooth
and
very
attractive
this
ones
one
of
my
favorites
has
a
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
that
does
not
really
add
or
distract
from
the
drinking
experience
a
great
beer
but
one
serving
is
enough
as
the
abv
will
lay
you
out
quickly
chewy
caramel
malts
hit
first
followed
by
a
prickly
booze
note
wheat
and
musty
resinous
hops
this
eisbock
is
complex
tasty
and
plentiful
in
its
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
plethora
of
sensations
thick
sticky
chewy
and
spicy
certainly
not
for
the
faint
of
palate
as
the
tall
order
of
booze
works
its
magic
on
both
the
tongue
and
body
surprisingly
it
complements
the
flavor
without
overpowering
some
of
the
more
subtle
notes
aventinus
has
definately
set
the
bar
for
german
wheats
and
their
eisbock
is
no
exception
heavy
powerful
and
delicious
this
is
a
beer
i
hope
to
encounter
again
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
and
i
cant
say
that
its
something
id
revisit
with
great
frequency
im
just
not
much
of
a
wheat
fan
but
id
choose
this
over
some
other
wheat
styles
watch
out
its
12
abv
a
full
body
is
a
bit
light
on
carbonation
and
a
little
syrupy
for
12
this
is
very
drinkable
d
i
thought
it
would
be
less
of
a
sipper
but
i
had
to
take
it
kind
of
slowly
still
a
very
fine
beer
and
glad
i
had
it
pours
an
inviting
dark
brow
dark
enough
to
reject
light
with
a
modest
one
finger
near
white
head
the
head
recedes
but
never
leaves
coating
the
top
of
the
beer
with
a
slowly
swirling
layer
of
tiny
bubbles
the
smell
is
intense
and
complex
with
layers
of
sweet
molasses
and
dark
brown
sugar
followed
by
raisins
and
plum
hints
of
toffee
and
maybe
a
touch
of
black
currant
taste
is
equally
intense
and
offers
similar
flavors
including
oddly
coca
cola
alcohol
is
forward
and
present
but
doesnt
distract
mouthfeel
is
influenced
by
the
warm
alcohol
but
not
dominated
by
it
fine
bubbles
tickle
the
tongue
while
a
medium
thick
consistency
coats
nicely
based
upon
the
aroma
i
expected
this
to
be
a
touch
too
sweet
for
real
drinkability
but
while
it
is
indeed
sweet
it
never
gets
cloying
and
if
not
for
the
somewhat
scary
12
percent
i
would
be
glad
to
have
another
highly
recommended
m
very
impressive
beer
incredibly
easy
to
sip
given
the
strength
high
abv
but
this
pulls
it
off
an
interesting
brew
this
unique
brew
is
the
color
of
mahogany
with
lots
of
fizz
in
the
pour
but
virtually
no
head
and
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
licorice
and
roasted
almonds
some
alcohol
very
nice
it
shows
low
carbonation
and
gives
a
mildly
oily
feel
it
has
a
sweet
smooth
raisin
and
molasses
flavor
with
warming
alcohol
and
toffee
pretty
strong
but
drinkable
very
balanced
really
coats
the
tongue
with
malty
candy
great
there
is
an
honesttogod
burn
on
the
way
down
mediumbodied
otherwise
but
a
tad
bubbly
a
very
strong
and
heavy
beer
dark
and
full
of
alcohol
pours
a
dark
brownish
color
and
smells
of
strong
sweet
and
alcoholic
caramel
rich
and
flavorful
but
short
of
cloying
taste
rich
concentrated
malt
flavor
some
toffee
like
notes
and
overall
pretty
good
surprised
by
this
one
due
to
the
alcohol
this
is
no
session
beer
two
of
these
will
have
you
talkin
funny
2004
vintage
brown
color
with
a
fully
developed
but
then
quickly
diminishing
white
foam
fairly
powerful
nose
with
hints
of
fresh
pastries
apples
banana
vanilla
along
with
hints
of
blackberry
and
mocha
flavor
is
loaded
with
complexity
a
thick
coating
of
caramel
and
toffee
coats
the
palate
along
with
hints
of
fruit
pie
vanilla
and
clove
coating
mouth
feel
wow
an
intense
badass
brew
d
pretty
high
abv
but
very
drinkable
abv
will
limit
how
many
you
can
physically
ingest
though
this
is
one
dangerous
beer
d
pretty
damn
delicious
whoa
the
taste
is
fantastic
sweet
syrupy
brisk
carbonation
boozey
but
not
overwhelming
the
beer
is
slightly
balanced
by
some
faint
hop
essence
but
this
is
hard
core
wheat
fruit
honey
etc
beautiful
beer
very
tasty
and
inviting
and
at
12
the
alcohol
is
barely
present
this
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
deep
semitransparent
brown
with
a
thick
beige
head
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
molasses
and
a
touch
of
hops
flavor
is
rich
and
smoky
mainly
malty
but
with
a
little
hop
taste
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
with
a
nice
ragged
alcohol
bite
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
original
aventinus
so
when
i
first
heard
about
this
brew
back
in
the
late
90s
i
couldnt
wait
to
try
it
i
ordered
some
of
the
striped
bottles
back
then
and
liked
them
a
lot
later
this
brew
finally
arrived
where
i
lived
so
i
bought
some
more
i
still
thought
it
was
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
regular
aventinus
i
bought
some
more
bottles
on
a
few
more
occasions
over
the
years
but
they
seemed
to
be
hitandmiss
i
think
some
of
the
bottles
were
old
however
about
a
year
ago
i
had
some
of
this
eisbock
on
tap
at
the
brickstore
in
atlanta
and
loved
it
that
restored
my
faith
in
this
brew
recently
i
bought
another
bottle
to
try
i
see
that
my
bottle
says
2007
on
it
that
made
me
a
little
nervous
about
it
still
having
a
fresh
taste
but
thankfully
im
enjoying
this
bottle
quite
a
bit
it
pours
an
unattractive
murky
brown
with
little
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
classic
weizen
but
with
some
stink
to
it
i
cant
quite
place
my
finger
on
what
the
stink
is
maybe
its
just
a
phenolic
thats
a
little
bit
out
of
control
thankfully
the
taste
is
better
than
the
appearance
and
aroma
it
tastes
a
lot
like
the
regular
aventinus
but
with
more
concentrations
of
everything
the
alcohol
seems
to
be
wellhidden
overall
i
like
this
bottled
brew
but
i
still
think
the
regular
aventinus
is
easily
superior
hopefully
ill
get
the
chance
to
try
some
draft
aventinus
eisbock
again
in
the
future
its
been
a
little
too
long
to
remember
for
sure
but
i
think
that
version
was
better
than
this
bottled
version
ddangerously
drinkable
a
seriously
top
notch
beer
i
hope
my
marks
arent
too
high
for
the
style
admittedly
i
dont
have
any
other
experience
with
eisbocks
so
i
may
be
a
little
overgenerous
bottle
01568
pours
as
black
as
velvet
can
get
with
a
thick
pillowy
rootbeer
head
in
a
sniftercould
be
the
fifth
horseman
of
the
apocalypse
by
its
intimidation
complex
scents
citrus
fruit
freshly
mown
hops
grass
and
a
grapefruit
mix
thin
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
lingering
aftertaste
that
holds
like
a
pilsner
citrusy
notes
abound
with
the
slightest
alcohol
hops
are
subdued
while
the
malts
are
impaling
heavy
these
guys
are
the
masters
and
though
above
my
usual
palate
this
beer
is
a
steam
roller
obliterating
any
preexisting
taste
in
the
mouth
andforcefully
asserting
its
power
memorable
and
warming
malt
malt
malt
d
overall
impression
very
strong
but
more
drinkable
than
i
would
have
thought
i
would
definitely
put
this
in
my
regular
rotation
give
it
a
try
finish
is
rootbeer
syrupy
too
a
dark
brown
beer
with
mahogany
highlights
has
a
small
tan
head
that
bubbles
away
quickly
there
is
a
sweet
dried
fruit
character
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
banana
in
the
background
the
taste
is
all
raisins
and
fig
with
a
strong
alcohol
push
on
the
finish
leaving
a
plum
after
taste
at
12
it
is
a
definite
sipper
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
its
characteristics
bring
to
mind
the
best
of
many
differenct
styles
from
best
bitters
to
weissbiers
to
heavier
german
ales
a
musttry
damn
good
beer
very
simple
in
flavor
any
more
complexities
and
it
may
have
interfered
with
the
simple
humble
quality
of
this
fine
beer
i
tried
this
beer
on
december
23
2007
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
tan
coloured
head
which
didnt
very
long
the
aroma
was
malt
and
sugar
it
was
a
sweet
smell
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
slightly
creamy
and
medium
carbonated
the
flavour
is
primarily
malty
but
there
is
a
peppery
sense
to
the
taste
as
well
as
an
almost
licorice
taste
examples
of
the
style
i
cannot
wait
to
be
able
to
try
this
one
again
it
really
is
that
good
this
beer
was
the
first
i
had
on
a
walking
tour
of
brauhauss
in
munich
reviewed
from
notes
this
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
had
a
wonderful
deep
purple
color
with
a
great
tan
head
that
didnt
seem
to
go
away
the
smell
was
extremely
floral
with
hints
of
wheat
yeast
deep
malt
characteristics
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
very
floral
start
that
melted
into
a
yeast
and
clove
filled
finish
the
beer
was
thick
but
not
too
much
only
negative
would
be
i
could
only
drink
the
one
being
at
the
beginning
of
the
tour
and
all
this
is
enjoyable
to
sip
and
savor
by
no
means
what
i
was
expecting
awesome
definitely
go
buy
a
bottle
this
beer
is
amazing
and
i
was
rather
excited
to
see
trappeze
pub
had
it
on
tap
since
tapping
the
first
keg
i
have
had
at
least
15
of
these
beers
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
purple
colors
mixed
in
smell
is
predominantly
of
sweet
dark
fruits
e
g
plum
apricot
as
well
as
banana
and
clove
taste
mirrors
the
smell
with
a
bit
more
sweet
and
spicy
clove
mouthfeel
is
nicely
sticky
sweet
and
perfect
for
the
style
i
will
drink
this
beer
whenever
i
see
it
on
tap
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
eisbock
only
the
2nd
ive
had
but
i
thought
it
was
quite
good
overall
alot
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
very
deep
and
fruity
with
a
wine
character
recommended
just
dont
pour
out
the
yeast
d
what
an
experience
a
very
unique
beer
that
is
very
candylike
makes
for
a
great
night
cap
ive
had
this
on
tap
fresh
as
well
and
both
forms
are
delicious
d
yum
this
is
a
very
big
beer
with
lots
of
beautiful
characteristics
pours
a
medium
cloudy
medium
to
dark
brown
color
with
dense
plentiful
tan
head
and
great
tracing
aromas
of
sweet
boozy
clove
scented
dates
and
prunes
plenty
of
alcohol
in
that
aroma
no
hiding
it
but
its
not
over
the
top
or
harsh
on
the
palate
it
is
thick
and
i
mean
thick
its
like
they
took
aventinus
and
reduced
it
flavors
of
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
really
dominate
fruity
esters
are
much
more
muted
than
the
original
with
the
alcohol
basically
pushing
them
out
this
is
one
beer
to
reckon
with
overall
id
say
theyve
really
done
a
great
job
with
making
it
drinkable
and
not
cloying
for
12
abv
compared
to
most
of
dfhs
offerings
overall
a
pretty
good
eisbock
although
i
think
it
could
to
with
a
bit
of
age
to
mellow
things
a
bit
not
a
patch
on
the
kulmbacher
eisbock
certainly
worth
a
try
though
an
unfortunate
and
expensive
loser
note
let
this
beer
warm
slightly
d
no
surprise
here
its
a
sipper
only
however
thats
not
due
to
the
alcohol
which
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
what
hurts
the
drinkability
at
least
for
me
it
that
its
both
syrupy
and
clove
dominated
pours
a
beautifully
ruby
cloudy
over
carbonated
beer
that
settles
to
a
nice
off
white
head
and
long
strings
of
bubbles
banana
bread
smell
no
hints
of
hops
some
fruity
easters
complex
malt
characteristics
vanilla
melanoidins
no
hoppiness
full
body
definite
alcohol
warmth
easy
to
drink
but
the
sweetness
lingers
to
the
point
of
almost
too
much
by
the
end
d
feels
like
drinking
a
weak
liquor
definitely
has
the
warming
feeling
in
the
stomach
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
the
fruit
notes
are
very
unique
and
add
a
lot
of
character
to
the
beer
i
think
ive
found
a
new
favorite
and
to
think
i
bought
this
by
mistake
i
meant
to
buy
the
8
abv
weizenbock
haha
oh
well
i
will
get
that
eventually
pours
a
dark
amber
color
and
has
quite
a
head
that
fades
very
quickly
but
leaves
no
lacing
i
can
tell
it
is
pretty
carbonated
just
because
it
sounds
like
a
cola
after
i
pour
it
smells
like
i
would
expect
from
a
bock
up
front
with
some
wheat
smells
afterwards
raisiny
malty
a
little
bit
of
wheat
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
coming
up
the
rear
tastes
absolutely
phenomenal
a
smooth
mellowed
out
caramel
malty
taste
with
a
hint
of
the
wheat
but
very
little
alcohol
the
alcohol
really
sneaks
up
on
you
in
this
one
since
it
comes
in
at
12
the
mouthfeel
is
really
smooth
and
goes
down
easily
its
very
drinkable
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
much
else
for
a
while
after
this
at
12
this
is
a
wolf
in
sheeps
clothing
quite
drinkable
considering
the
monstrous
abv
that
being
said
one
bottle
is
probably
enough
a
nice
deviation
from
the
regular
aventinus
that
is
wellworth
a
try
cloudy
reddish
hue
with
thick
head
nose
is
clove
some
smoke
and
banana
taste
very
rich
brew
honey
sweetness
with
the
spicy
malts
finish
is
hot
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
too
syrupy
this
is
the
definition
of
liqiud
bread
drinkability
is
high
given
the
booze
level
in
it
luckily
the
richness
counterbalances
as
more
than
a
couple
bottles
of
this
would
be
a
quick
end
to
the
evening
very
nice
beer
drinkability
is
excellent
although
the
brew
has
a
decently
heavy
body
it
works
to
its
advantage
wonderfuly
complex
with
an
excellent
profile
in
aroma
and
taste
prost
d
definitely
a
session
beer
one
a
night
for
me
this
isnt
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
i
definitely
appreciate
it
i
would
only
buy
this
once
every
couple
years
as
a
celebration
type
of
beer
and
only
to
share
with
another
even
though
its
not
my
favorite
im
trying
to
review
it
based
on
and
compared
with
other
similar
beersstyles
its
definitely
above
average
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
bottle
left
at
my
house
by
dispholidus1
for
long
enough
that
i
can
justify
drinking
it
pours
brown
walnut
colored
big
solid
head
of
foam
bubbles
rise
constantly
smells
of
candied
plums
dark
chocolate
and
ethanol
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
a
pleasant
nuttiness
fruity
complexity
with
touches
of
strawberry
cherries
dates
plums
chocolate
and
caramel
ethanol
bite
just
on
the
finish
but
very
smooth
otherwise
velvety
and
thick
medium
to
full
bodied
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
treat
and
an
affordable
one
at
that
even
when
i
actually
have
to
pay
for
it
aventinus
weizeneisbock
pours
a
deep
hazy
amber
with
a
foamy
head
that
fades
to
almost
nothing
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
syrupy
with
tons
of
dark
fruitiness
with
hints
cooked
corn
there
is
a
deep
earthy
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
sweet
and
syrupy
with
lots
of
dark
fruits
and
dark
caramel
lots
of
spicy
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
end
making
this
one
a
sipper
for
sure
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
highly
refreshing
for
such
a
full
bodied
and
high
gravity
brew
the
cloves
and
spices
especially
are
phenomenal
concealing
the
alcohol
beneath
layers
of
delicious
complexity
and
leave
the
pallet
and
the
mouth
craving
the
next
sip
and
regretting
the
moment
that
the
last
drop
is
gone
i
think
this
is
one
i
would
drink
all
night
if
my
wallet
and
my
liver
could
handle
it
appears
a
big
deep
murky
caramel
amber
brown
hue
large
highly
carbonated
effervescent
tan
head
forms
quick
and
fades
slowly
the
lacing
is
thick
and
clings
effortlessly
to
the
glass
aroma
contains
tart
apples
figs
and
raisins
with
a
slight
vinegar
or
fermented
cider
edge
to
it
fusel
alcohol
flows
as
well
as
concentrated
sticky
brown
molasses
and
toasted
caramel
notes
spicy
with
clove
and
effervescent
carbonation
tickling
the
nose
hairs
flavor
brings
a
flood
of
dramatic
caramel
and
burnt
brown
sugar
malt
sweetness
with
layers
of
alcohol
ripened
dried
fruits
glazed
with
sugar
mild
banana
strong
upfront
tart
apples
and
deep
raisin
notes
galore
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
with
carbonation
coming
real
lively
body
is
medium
to
full
texture
is
syrupy
especially
as
it
warms
although
it
never
comes
of
cloying
to
me
drinkability
is
actually
pretty
awesome
for
a
german
ice
beer
it
focuses
and
concentrates
all
of
the
likeable
characteristics
aventinus
eisbock
pours
a
murky
deep
woody
brown
that
shows
redorange
when
held
up
to
a
light
the
head
starts
off
about
one
centimeter
thick
but
falls
to
thin
film
of
tiny
bubbles
in
a
short
time
the
smell
is
typical
weizen
yeast
banana
and
clove
but
it
is
subtle
here
there
is
also
a
fair
level
of
bready
wheat
and
the
dominating
solventy
alcohol
the
taste
is
upfront
alcohol
solventy
and
slightly
hot
peppery
and
syrupy
slick
in
the
taste
im
getting
much
more
of
the
clove
ester
than
the
banana
but
that
is
there
too
along
with
the
wheaty
grain
in
the
background
there
is
no
mistaking
that
this
is
a
real
german
weizen
i
dont
get
any
bitterness
at
all
in
this
it
is
totally
overwhelmed
by
the
malt
and
alcohol
but
i
guess
that
is
fine
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
warming
and
slightly
slick
the
moderate
carbonation
keeps
things
from
feeling
too
flat
and
heavy
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
may
have
expected
a
bit
more
however
that
being
said
im
really
not
that
disappointed
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
this
eisbock
remains
very
drinkable
is
still
quite
well
rounded
and
a
is
definitely
a
classic
wheat
beer
had
this
from
the
bottle
at
emerald
coast
brew
fest
in
pensacola
fl
in
092007
dont
know
how
i
forgot
to
rate
this
poured
an
attractive
caramelbrown
color
had
a
nice
white
head
that
hung
around
a
while
aroma
is
sweet
possibly
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
but
finishes
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
note
mouthfeel
is
good
drinkability
is
high
for
a
beer
with
an
abv
north
of
8
my
first
weizenbock
ive
seen
cellaring
has
been
recommended
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
one
over
the
next
few
years
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
related
it
to
a
favorite
of
mine
celebrator
except
having
a
bit
of
a
stronger
more
mature
taste
to
it
the
maltiness
was
well
balanced
with
the
alcohol
warmth
combined
with
a
deep
caramel
oak
flavor
the
higher
alcohol
feel
was
present
yet
it
wasnt
over
powering
it
made
for
easy
sipping
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
over
and
over
again
drinkability
wow
for
its
strength
this
beer
is
not
that
complex
but
it
sure
is
good
and
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
mmm
d
the
drinkability
is
scary
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
before
the
alcohol
kicks
in
this
beer
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
not
a
lot
of
carbontion
but
still
pretty
smooth
finish
is
dirty
d
sorry
this
is
a
delicious
and
balanced
brew
but
i
could
not
do
another
this
is
potent
stuff
id
recommend
this
one
with
confidence
at
any
rate
though
as
it
is
quite
tasty
if
it
werent
for
the
high
abv
this
would
be
a
session
beer
but
i
would
recommend
that
any
beer
drinker
no
matter
your
style
preference
drink
at
least
one
due
to
the
thickness
and
overall
bearing
of
this
drink
i
would
recommend
sipping
not
just
tossing
it
back
as
the
preferred
method
of
enjoyment

strong

this

and
the
very
hefty

was
noticeable
both
in
the
nose
and
taste
good
thick
mouthfeel
but
average
drinkability
due
to
the
strong
alcohol
percentage
and
ultrarich
very
thick
flavor
that
dominated
the
pallate
and
took
over
this
beer
this
is
seriously
flavorful
stuff
very
overbearing
and
powerful
and
is
better
off
sipped
strong
thick
rich
and
dominating
this
was
certainly
an
interesting
sample
that
should
be
enjoyed
over
a
period
of
time
worth
a
try
with
a
noticeable
grapetaste
drinkability
this
beer
has
awesome
drinkability
for
its
high
abv
the
flavor
and
smell
were
on
point
i
couldve
easily
had
the
entire
bottle
to
myself
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
still
well
carbonated
after
almost
3
years
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
plays
a
role
more
in
the
taste
enhancing
the
fruity
flavors
than
the
mouthfeel
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
little
to
no
head
smells
of
deep
complex
rich
malts
mingled
with
noticable
banana
and
clove
scents
and
some
licorice
too
as
it
sits
in
my
mouth
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
that
i
can
hear
it
bubbling
in
my
mouth
it
really
comes
alive
in
there
taste
is
of
dense
malts
deep
the
banana
and
clove
arent
nearly
as
prominent
it
is
a
fairly
thick
beer
that
coats
the
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
bready
and
boozey
this
is
very
tasty
i
think
i
still
prefer
regular
aventinus
but
this
is
a
heck
of
a
great
beer
md
big
thick
sticky
full
body
alcohol
is
there
in
bunches
but
very
tolerable
also
pretty
warming
carbonation
is
light
to
medium
good
beer
but
i
dont
know
how
much
i
could
drink
very
strong
very
big
very
good
overall
the
booziness
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
was
too
much
for
me
quite
good
and
interesting
but
the
original
is
far
better
and
you
can
have
more
this
is
one
and
out
thank
you
again
dan
this
was
the
first
eisbock
that
i
have
tried
all
positive
comments
aside
from
the
taste
i
guess
i
was
looking
for
the
same
experience
one
gets
if
you
compare
a
glass
johannesburg
riesling
with
a
glass
of
eiswien
indeed
the
alcohol
and
sugar
content
of
this
eisbock
is
stronger
but
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
not
what
i
expected
it
has
a
very
strong
syrup
flavor
and
reminds
me
of
port
wine
i
am
eager
to
try
other
beers
of
this
style
its
a
bigger
beer
than
an
imperial
stout
im
glad
i
bought
it
even
though
i
can
manage
only
one
per
sitting
recommended
even
though
i
prefer
the
kulmbacher
eisboch
i
will
be
buying
more
d
too
big
to
have
many
but
enjoyable
a
great
winter
beer
edit
not
as
drinkable
as
i
thought
the
fact
that
it
is
23
the
size
of
a
bottle
of
wine
just
as
strong
and
as
sweet
as
port
makes
it
a
little
hard
to
finish
still
tasty
though
in
the
end
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
though
i
dont
know
how
many
of
these
i
could
put
away
in
the
course
of
an
evening
overall
quite
enjoyable
similar
to
the
original
but
kicked
up
a
notch
unfortunately
this
is
a
slightly
less
subtle
brew
than
its
weaker
cousin
the
more
delicate
flavours
i
expect
from
the
regular
aventinus
are
here
overwhelmed
by
the
alcohol
and
malty
sweetness
nonetheless
it
is
extremely
tasty
and
highly
recommended
alcohol
level
in
this
brew
can
make
it
a
challenge
to
drink
definitely
worth
saving
for
an
afterdinner
dessert
and
then
in
small
quantities
large
quantites
can
be
headache
inducing
but
overall
this
is
still
a
really
good
and
complex
brew
that
is
worthy
of
a
try
d
good
beer
not
as
good
as
the
other
aventinus
but
still
good
probably
only
the
45th
time
ive
had
this
over
the
years
typically
i
am
not
a
fan
of
german
wheats
but
lately
ive
been
trying
to
expand
my
horizons
and
this
is
the
beer
to
do
it
with
awesome
and
would
cellar
like
a
champ
d
this
is
obviously
a
big
beer
and
not
for
the
weak
of
palate
i
feel
a
little
overmatched
here
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
whole
one
myself
very
often
anyway
better
for
sharing
between
2
or
3
ppl
and
take
it
slow
pours
a
muddy
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
into
a
slight
cap
the
cap
was
gone
by
the
end
of
the
glass
leaving
a
flat
muddy
looking
brew
the
smell
is
strong
caramalized
bananas
honey
nut
clusters
cereal
brown
sugar
concentrated
raisin
juice
if
there
is
such
a
thing
medicinal
phenols
the
taste
is
of
a
concentrated
hefeweizen
with
added
prune
juice
banana
and
clove
flavors
mixed
with
sweet
dark
fruits
no
malt
bitterness
in
this
one
the
flavors
are
very
strong
but
the
sweetness
will
be
a
bit
cloying
towards
the
end
the
feel
is
moderate
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
slick
finish
definitely
a
strong
aroma
and
taste
with
this
brew
but
the
sweetness
is
off
the
hook
and
limits
the
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
not
detected
but
im
sure
its
strong
tastes
of
cloves
and
other
spices
once
again
lots
of
plum
and
raisin
huge
warming
alcohol
and
molasses
this
is
one
hell
of
a
night
cap
the
body
is
moderate
not
too
heavy
which
is
surprising
given
the
maltiness
the
alcohol
tingles
everything
you
can
definently
feel
the
alcohol
but
boy
does
it
go
down
well
compared
to
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
could
possibly
take
more
then
just
one
of
them
at
first
i
wasnt
really
liking
this
brew
but
it
grew
on
me
as
i
sipped
it
its
not
like
any
other
beer
i
have
had
to
date
the
story
behind
this
beer
is
really
cool
read
the
back
of
the
bottle
serendipity
at
its
finest
and
reinvented
to
boot11
very
fruity
big
alcohol
punch
lots
of
spritz
in
the
mouthfeel
better
than
a
macro
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
its
supposedly
simpler
cousin
comparisons
to
a
barleywine
are
apt
too
harsh
edged
to
be
a
true
hit
if
you
like
the
other
version
of
this
brew
try
it
so
you
know
and
then
go
back
and
pick
up
some
of
the
other
pours
a
dark
caramel
brown
into
a
tulip
with
some
yeasties
left
floating
around
to
make
things
interesting
has
a
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
with
virtually
no
lacing
left
behind
smell
is
very
complex
and
sublime
with
malts
cheries
grapes
esters
and
alcohol
wafting
above
it
all
to
let
you
know
this
brew
means
business
tastes
just
as
complex
as
it
smells
with
sweet
caramel
more
grapes
a
certain
tartness
grain
and
nice
alcohol
heat
to
finish
things
off
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
somewhat
weightless
with
the
edges
rounded
off
a
bit
making
it
very
satisfying
going
down
many
people
have
described
this
beer
a
lot
better
than
i
can
but
i
know
whats
good
and
this
is
good
my
favorite
eisbock
is
still
my
favorite
the
last
time
i
had
it
i
thought
it
was
just
a
bigger
version
of
the
normal
aventinus
weizenbock
but
this
time
around
it
had
a
little
different
characteristics
really
good
d
this
beer
does
not
hide
what
it
is
a
big
old
ice
beer
but
i
dont
care
it
is
still
incredibly
drinkable
and
fun
to
drink
as
well
just
having
this
beer
do
its
work
in
your
mouth
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
for
its
high
alcohol
content
i
wish
i
can
do
this
again
tomorrow
d
very
warming
and
certainly
a
sipper
this
is
my
flag
beer
i
love
it
its
pretty
much
bottled
sex
d
having
never
had
aventinus
or
an
eisbock
this
beer
absolutely
blew
me
away
such
great
balance
and
bouquet
of
flavors
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
it
should
be
noted
that
even
at
12abv
the
alcohol
takes
a
backseat
to
the
wonderful
blend
of
fruits
and
malts
bottle
011124
aroma
of
chocolate
clovebanana
and
toasted
malt
hazy
dark
brown
with
light
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
slight
collar
falvor
is
chocolate
banana
up
frront
which
steps
aside
for
huge
alcohol
and
malt
tail
is
phenol
and
alcohol
very
warming
drinkability
one
in
a
sitting
is
enough
for
me
very
rich
sweeet
deal
and
not
to
mention
this
buzz
appeared
out
of
nowhere
drinkability
doesnt
seem
like
12
just
finished
this
and
a
gonzo
porter
and
not
feeling
much
of
anything
not
to
mention
the
hopsickle
i
had
earlier
while
making
my
chili
and
cornbread
one
of
a
handful
of
eisbocks
ive
had
was
expecting
more
but
still
good
and
very
drinkable
flavor
is
good
but
not
as
thick
as
expected
have
had
this
one
on
tap
before
and
had
better
results
rating
is
based
on
a
combp
of
this
consumption
and
past
ones
i
would
reccomend
trying
this
one
d
this
is
a
winter
beer
or
one
meant
for
servings
as
a
special
after
dinner
substitute
for
desert
i
enjoyed
it
but
doubt
i
could
repeat
it
too
many
more
times
before
the
sweetness
became
overbearing
d
a
very
good
beer
but
being
big
can
hit
you
hard
this
should
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
i
wanted
to
get
this
one
for
awhile
but
only
saw
it
recently
for
the
first
time
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
high
carbonation
and
a
thin
lace
of
head
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
high
alcohol
content
is
definitely
present
in
the
smell
and
as
sweet
malty
and
a
little
bit
fruity
aromas
the
taste
is
superb
malty
slightly
bitter
and
wheat
flavor
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
with
the
alcohol
leaving
tingly
feeling
i
would
of
liked
to
see
a
little
more
head
but
it
is
an
extremely
well
balanced
beer
that
is
hard
to
improve
on
this
is
my
first
eisbock
review
a
ill
be
looking
out
for
more
in
the
future
this
beer
is
super
foamy
dark
brown
with
a
ton
of
head
but
not
much
lace
the
smell
is
strong
with
alcohol
but
the
malt
pleasantly
breaks
through
this
beer
is
super
smooth
and
sweet
there
are
some
grain
in
the
taste
and
closely
resembles
a
barleywine
it
is
an
all
a
round
great
beer
with
a
nice
warming
feeling
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fine
all
of
this
combined
with
the
wheat
makes
for
a
near
creamy
smoothness
as
noted
previously
the
alcohol
is
deceivingly
absent
but
there
is
a
distinct
warming
effect
pleasantly
enjoyed
as
an
aventinus
sipper
shares
all
the
qualities
of
the
standard
aventinus
but
amplified
i
particularly
enjoyed
this
being
that
its
a
colder
evening
pair
this
with
any
sort
of
cake
or
pastry
featuring
fall
fruits
d
seriously
unbelievably
easy
to
drink
youd
think
such
a
radioactive
beer
would
require
some
effort
to
get
down
the
throat
im
now
on
2
on
reviewing
this
and
it
just
keeps
getting
better
if
it
wasnt
for
the
crazy
alcohol
content
id
drink
many
more
of
these
a
big
beer
with
tons
of
flavor
but
even
packing
a
punch
of
12
it
goes
down
easy
a
beer
i
will
definitely
revisit
overall
i
like
it
but
i
prefer
the
wiezenbock
much
more
this
was
a
pretty
incredible
beer
ive
got
one
more
in
the
cellar
closet
and
i
think
ill
pick
up
a
few
more
from
the
store
where
i
got
it
2005
edition
poured
with
a
ton
of
head
for
being
2
years
old
off
white
and
more
bubbly
than
thick
the
body
was
a
nice
shade
of
brown
not
as
dark
as
a
porter
but
clearer
and
less
opaque
than
a
brown
ale
there
were
some
particulates
floating
in
the
bottem
too
the
head
stayed
around
for
the
entire
drinkage
which
was
a
rather
long
time
as
i
sipped
it
through
dinner
and
dessert
the
smell
was
of
various
sweet
malts
mostly
caramelly
and
nothing
to
impressive
but
still
very
appetizing
tastewise
i
was
blown
away
brown
sugar
and
caramel
mix
around
many
lighter
malts
to
create
an
intricate
profile
beyond
my
ability
to
decipher
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
perfect
but
actually
not
as
thickly
bodied
as
i
would
have
liked
for
the
alcohol
content
and
the
flavor
the
carbonation
was
a
little
heavy
as
well
it
was
a
well
carbonated
port
like
brew
and
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
port
very
easy
to
drink
making
me
want
another
one
moments
after
i
finished
the
first
with
12
abv
consider
this
one
dangerous
overall
this
is
one
complex
beer
and
a
must
try
for
any
beer
drinker
i
love
the
story
of
how
the
first
eisbock
was
accidentally
created
see
todds
review
for
more
info
and
im
glad
they
decided
to
recreate
it
for
those
of
us
who
werent
around
60
years
ago
id
love
to
cellar
some
of
this
and
see
how
it
emerges
a
few
years
from
now
12
ounce
bottle
bottle
051076
served
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
mahoganydark
brown
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
low
the
aroma
is
very
nice
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
bubblegum
bananas
caramel
peppery
spice
and
some
alcohol
it
tastes
very
malty
like
dark
fruit
alcohol
pepper
cloves
and
bananas
the
alcohol
is
noticable
but
it
doesnt
hurt
the
overall
taste
of
the
beer
too
much
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
coating
finish
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
id
definitely
buy
it
again
and
recommend
it
to
others
an
interesting
and
complex
beerdefinatly
a
sipper
that
goes
down
easily
had
a
lot
of
beligium
characterictics
to
it
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
againwould
be
great
on
a
cold
winter
night
d
the
12abv
limits
the
drinkability
but
id
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
to
adventure
into
different
beers
good
on
the
odd
occasion
drinkability
well
at
being
12
alcohol
it
would
be
hard
to
have
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
during
a
single
night
i
consider
it
a
great
example
of
german
brewing
excellence
and
quality
a
bit
strong
to
be
a
5
in
drinkability
for
me
but
it
won
me
over
such
a
great
beer
that
was
just
another
in
a
list
of
many
that
michael
jackson
promoted
the
drinkability
is
great
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
important
traditionally
as
well
flavor
wise
imo
i
think
this
is
an
interesting
drink
but
lacks
the
drinkability
of
beer
or
the
more
etherial
subtleties
of
spirits
d
it
is
one
big
beer
that
isnt
shy
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
searching
for
it
enjoy
d
the
high
abv
limits
the
drinkability
but
this
will
definitely
be
my
favorite
cold
weather
evening
beer
a
great
beer
all
around
i
am
glad
i
bought
some
to
cellar
so
i
can
track
its
maturity
d
certainly
an
assertive
beer
in
its
own
right
but
rolling
over
the
palate
it
offered
dynamic
change
from
weak
to
strong
glad
i
had
this
though
as
it
is
near
impossible
to
get
around
here
and
to
get
it
at
the
source
was
a
rare
treat
for
me
indeed
thanks
to
cburian
for
sharing
this
with
me
very
drinkable
for
12
abv
highly
recommended
overall
my
first
foray
into
eisbocks
aventinus
has
seriously
raised
the
bar
for
others
of
the
style
highly
recommended
poured
a
nice
hazy
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
slowly
diminished
to
a
ring
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
dried
fruits
dried
fruits
also
dominated
the
taste
followed
by
wheat
a
strange
almost
bbq
saucelike
flavor
was
also
present
the
beer
was
rather
heavy
with
the
alcohol
being
slightly
abrasive
this
one
took
me
a
while
to
drink
but
i
do
enjoy
it
especially
as
something
completely
different
from
anything
i
usually
drink
11
2oz
bottle
labelled
2006
pours
a
murky
muddy
brown
with
some
little
bubbles
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
wheaty
but
not
particularly
strong
taste
is
all
aventinus
up
front
but
then
feels
heavier
and
more
alcoholic
on
its
way
down
almost
warmer
i
probably
should
have
prefaced
this
review
by
saying
that
regular
aventinus
is
one
of
my
favourite
beers
of
all
time
so
i
was
practically
giddy
about
trying
this
one
flavour
is
good
well
it
would
have
to
be
but
im
not
sure
its
necessarily
better
than
regular
aventinus
but
it
certainly
goes
down
the
throat
more
like
hard
liquor
than
a
beer
overall
i
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
the
taste
was
nice
but
i
think
the
alcohol
taste
masked
the
true
flavor
of
this
beer
nice
to
say
i
have
had
it
but
i
probably
would
not
buy
it
again
this
is
totally
different
from
the
other
eisbock
kulmbacher
i
have
tried
which
i
dont
think
was
made
with
wheat
but
i
may
be
wrong
this
is
a
great
and
unique
beer
highly
recommended
this
is
an
excellent
eisbock
i
think
its
time
to
buy
some
more
drinkability
as
this
being
my
first
eisbock
im
at
a
loss
as
to
comparisons
however
i
will
say
this
is
quite
the
sipping
beer
to
be
enjoyed
throughout
the
evening
dont
try
this
at
home
without
appropriate
supervision
ill
have
to
put
some
of
these
away
to
see
how
well
these
mature
to
my
taste
i
didnt
find
this
high
abv
as
appealing
as
other
offerings
ill
have
to
expand
my
experience
with
eisbocks
to
provide
a
fair
comparison
d
very
good
not
something
to
take
lightly
better
suited
for
a
cold
day
and
i
had
this
on
a
hot
one
would
like
to
try
it
in
the
winter
d
i
think
this
beer
makes
for
a
fine
dessert
beer
but
i
would
only
drink
it
in
the
winter
months
given
the
style
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
perhaps
one
of
the
finest
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
being
12
abv
it
is
also
very
complex
im
certainly
glad
i
tried
it
dwhoa
dangerously
good
aventinus
is
a
superior
brewery
and
the
eisbock
is
no
exception
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
is
not
heavy
handed
in
the
taste
when
it
comes
to
alcohol
despite
the
aggresive
8
abv
enjoy
it
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
aventinus
weizen
eisbock
pours
a
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
thick
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malt
banana
and
clove
taste
is
intense
a
stronger
version
of
aventinus
for
sure
in
addition
to
banana
and
clove
flavors
there
were
some
medicinal
flavors
floating
through
the
mix
as
well
not
really
off
putting
but
definitely
present
alcohol
is
more
felt
than
tasted
but
i
think
theres
a
hint
of
it
in
the
taste
too
there
is
a
thick
mouthfeel
that
i
really
enjoyed
recommended
i
dont
feel
as
crippled
after
this
as
i
do
after
a
brooklyn
monster
ale
or
a
bigfoot
but
you
have
to
respect
the
alcohol
drinkability
for
this
beer
is
would
you
like
to
drink
a
second
one
the
answer
is
a
most
resounding
yes
needs
to
be
more
syrupy
but
i
have
wanted
this
for
a
while
and
am
not
sorry
i
got
it
if
i
had
a
cellar
i
would
buy
a
few
this
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
its
not
a
style
that
i
visit
very
often
either
after
an
aggressive
pour
i
still
didnt
get
very
much
head
at
all
it
was
a
very
dark
brown
and
had
a
sweet
molasses
smell
to
it
first
few
drinks
i
pulled
a
brown
sugar
and
kind
of
a
hot
cinnamon
taste
from
it
is
a
good
mid
body
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
tobacco
taste
in
it
as
well
the
alcohol
is
recognizable
but
i
would
have
never
guessed
12
drinks
more
like
a
8
or
9
a
great
beer
overall
when
i
got
down
to
the
end
of
it
i
notice
a
ton
of
sediment
thats
to
be
expected
syrupy
malt
presence
sweet
as
hell
and
very
full
and
creamy
diacetyl
and
clove
fight
with
dark
carameltoffee
malt
no
real
significant
hop
flavor
wheat
makes
it
so
very
easy
to
drink
finish
is
fullbodied
with
lots
of
flavors
left
over
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
thought
it
was
the
tastiest
double
digit
abv
beer
id
had
its
still
way
up
there
overall
this
feels
like
drinking
liquor
pairs
up
nicely
with
a
cigar
but
a
little
harsh
to
drink
a
sipper
at
best
very
strong
and
interesting
aromas
though
md
this
is
a
suprisingly
smooth
and
esy
to
drink
beer
there
is
a
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
nothing
bad
or
too
intense
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
very
enjoyable
poured
from
the
bottle
a
purplish
brown
with
an
soft
white
head
good
complexity
in
aroma
and
body
flavor
is
sweet
and
rich
with
cloves
and
citrus
tastes
warming
alcohol
mouthfeel
with
alot
of
yeast
and
bread
in
the
finish
try
this
along
with
a
piece
of
quality
dark
chocolate
overall
this
beer
was
extremely
enjoyable
i
would
not
hesitate
to
get
it
again
and
in
fact
ill
probably
try
to
get
it
often
dark
caramel
color
with
a
nose
of
candy
corn
andor
dark
candy
sugar
flavor
is
the
same
with
stewed
dark
fruits
raisins
and
prunes
with
yeasty
burnt
currants
it
was
not
without
a
certain
character
reminiscent
of
a
dark
strong
belgian
ale
because
of
that
i
will
take
the
regular
aventinus
over
it
for
its
bockweizen
character
really
good
though

d
wow
ive
had
high
abvs
before
but
nothing
like
this
be
careful
this
is
like
a
couple
of
bigfoots
kicking
you
in
the
pants
clocking
in
at
a
mere
12
this
guy
mirrors
and
even
mocks
the
19
dogfish
head
wws
in
my
experience
its
bitter
but
overall
that
should
be
countered
by
a
cautious
sipping
pours
a
dark
translucent
brown
with
a
thin
head
and
little
lacing
the
aromas
are
of
banana
clove
and
toffee
the
taste
is
complex
and
quite
nice
if
a
little
bit
on
the
sweet
side
more
clove
cinammon
baked
apples
bananas
and
a
long
sweet
malty
finish
with
lots
of
clove
on
the
finish
as
well
quite
spritzy
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
not
really
cloying
even
though
its
a
somewhat
sweet
beer
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
alcohol
which
is
well
hidden
a
nice
after
dinner
sipper

mediumbodied
with
very
little
carbonation
tasty
as
hell
but
too
malty
and
alcoholic
to
be
drinkable
dark
murky
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
is
well
retained
aroma
is
very
complex
banana
fruit
cherries
and
figs
tobacco
brown
sugar
and
spices
flavor
of
caramel
clove
banana
and
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
fortunately
the
alcohol
serves
to
cut
the
sweetness
and
spiciness
balancing
the
flavor
quite
well
an
excellent
beer
one
of
my
favorites
d
i
enjoy
heavy
beers
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
vs
others
an
excellent
beer
reminds
me
why
i
really
like
this
style
of
beer
too
bad
there
arent
more
brewers
out
there
making
this
complex
beer
cant
wait
to
have
the
2nd
one
i
have
in
stock
this
is
a
more
refined
but
bigger
version
of
the
regular
aventinus
doppelbock
the
beer
is
basically
a
german
version
of
the
barley
wine
dark
and
very
fruity
almost
clovelike
on
the
nose
this
is
a
sipper
that
evokes
the
complexity
of
doppelbock
but
with
bigger
finish
with
higher
abv
drinkable
in
that
im
very
much
enjoying
drinking
this
as
a
dessert
after
a
filling
dinner
but
is
it
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
did
i
hear
you
ask
a
session
beer
yeah
i
didnt
think
you
asked
me
that
this
is
whole
different
experience
than
drinking
the
original
you
cant
really
compare
the
2
to
each
other
but
each
one
is
a
unique
and
great
drinking
experience
in
and
of
itself
im
writing
this
review
as
i
drink
this
from
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
from
an
11
5
ounce
bottle
04029
2006
with
a
quick
fizzy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
globs
of
yeast
float
around
color
is
a
very
murky
brown
and
slightly
unappealing
aroma
includes
alcohol
grapes
an
unidentifiable
but
distinctly
sour
smell
apples
and
dried
fruit
taste
is
distinctly
malty
with
essentially
no
bitterness
its
quite
sweet
with
vinous
and
vanilla
notes
in
the
forefront
along
with
the
distinct
solvent
taste
of
alcohol
which
is
quite
pleasant
with
the
other
flavors
the
bubble
gum
and
banana
flavors
i
hear
about
are
also
present
but
subtle
and
harder
for
me
to
detect
there
is
a
distinct
smokiness
in
this
beer
not
unlike
a
pinot
noir
or
merlot
wine
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
but
fairly
thin
compared
to
what
i
was
expecting
the
drinkability
is
very
high
except
i
imagine
when
you
get
to
number
3
or
4
and
realize
youre
tanked
oops
i
just
burped
and
the
banana
taste
was
bold
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tried
thus
far
very
high
recommendation
this
is
quite
the
unique
beer
i
cant
say
ive
had
anything
else
like
it
smells
much
better
than
it
tastes
to
me
its
odd
i
keep
thinking
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
crossed
with
a
german
hefe
not
a
session
beer
at
all
but
its
hitting
the
spot
tonight
and
i
think
its
well
worth
a
try
thanks
to
khaismus
for
sharing
d
i
would
have
a
bottle
but
not
very
often
the
pour
into
my
toolarge
aventinus
normal
weizen
glass
raises
almost
no
head
at
all
just
a
thin
tan
layer
that
quickly
and
noisily
fades
to
nothing
theres
a
lot
of
thick
chunky
sediment
in
the
murky
brownredcopper
body
i
suppose
i
should
have
poured
carefully
but
i
didnt
expect
this
from
the
style
a
strong
sweet
raisin
scent
poured
out
of
the
bottle
with
the
liquid
immediately
there
are
also
notes
of
molasses
pepper
mint
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
syrupysweet
with
huge
maltiness
i
suppose
theres
a
bit
of
flavor
reminiscent
of
wheat
but
perhaps
i
wouldnt
have
said
so
if
i
didnt
have
a
label
to
read
the
alcohol
is
also
quite
forward
for
something
so
huge
the
mouth
isnt
absurdly
thick
carbonation
is
minimal
though
a
bit
rough
overall
this
beer
is
truly
a
seamless
melding
of
a
weizen
and
an
eisbock
definitely
a
joy
to
sip
and
savor
this
beer
was
immensly
rich
and
complex
it
was
rediculously
drinkable
considering
the
12
abv
this
beer
is
truly
a
masterpiece
i
can
find
no
flaws
d
great
stuff
though
i
prefer
the
subtler
weizenbocks
great
flavor
though
i
dont
think
i
couldshould
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
its
12
abv
and
there
is
no
hidding
it
all
in
all
though
an
all
around
good
beer
try
it
for
yourself
the
12
is
dangerously
well
hidden
and
quite
warming
on
this
chilly
february
evening
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
having
this
classic
welcome
to
hellasweet
gummy
wheat
land
and
not
a
word
of
that
is
a
knock
no
this
is
one
extralarge
graingracious
bavarian
bock
sure
the
abv
sticks
its
fingers
up
your
nose
and
leads
you
willynilly
by
the
nostrils
but
the
warmth
it
imparts
keeps
it
cozy
and
worth
the
mild
degradation
so
sip
away
you
saucy
sots
and
savor
it
as
it
demands
of
its
imbibers
drinkability
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipping
brew
at
12
still
its
delicious
and
interesting
and
easy
enough
to
drink
for
what
it
is
drinkability
was
fine
with
the
stipulation
that
it
is
definitely
something
you
want
to
sip
rather
than
gulp
overall
very
good
for
its
type
but
i
prefer
the
regular
aventinus
personally
i
could
drink
this
all
day
well
done
eisbocks
are
tough
to
beat
and
this
is
nearly
the
best
that
ive
had
the
booze
is
covered
remarkably
well
the
phenyls
that
do
come
through
are
pleasing
and
add
to
the
feel
by
warming
and
soothing
the
mouth
tongue
and
throat
appears
deep
and
dark
and
deceivingly
purple
more
a
reaction
to
the
bottles
label
then
the
beer
itself
medicinal
aromas
and
rich
spices
bananas
and
jams
fermented
mystery
fruits
that
you
might
find
in
your
great
aunts
cupboard
caramel
bubblegum
yum
yum
yumthis
is
so
good
if
i
ever
find
this
on
tap
it
will
lead
to
one
hell
of
a
drunken
night
or
rather
a
great
drunken
couple
of
hours
followed
by
a
hellish
and
sleepless
night
and
an
even
worse
morning
this
beer
is
like
an
m32
grenade
launcher
its
versatile
and
can
hit
you
six
times
in
3
seconds
i
love
it
oh
my
at
first
i
thought
something
was
wrong
with
this
beer
it
poured
think
and
cloudy
then
i
remembered
well
this
is
a
special
beer
and
the
combination
of
wheat
dunkel
and
bock
and
then
sorta
frozen
i
really
shouldnt
judge
until
i
take
a
taste
very
malty
bready
aromas
taste
is
like
a
regular
aventinus
on
steroids
but
legal
such
an
intense
flavor
its
almost
hard
to
decribe
there
is
sweetness
and
some
traditonal
weizen
flavors
as
well
banna
and
clove
but
everything
is
strong
and
mellow
thats
the
beaty
of
this
beer
just
an
exceptional
beer
very
warming
and
delightful
by
the
fire
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable
though
the
sheer
strength
of
the
flavor
not
to
mention
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
keep
this
from
being
the
perfect
session
beer
it
is
still
very
drinkable
this
is
my
favorite
12
beer
and
id
gladly
take
it
over
any
barleywine
ive
had
this
would
beer
an
ideal
beer
for
a
cold
winters
night
prost
thicker
than
a
weizen
and
smoother
than
back
easy
to
drink
but
the
abv
can
be
a
bit
too
much
even
with
the
bottle
size
drinkability
is
good
but
it
is
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
the
alcohol
content
is
always
noticeable
and
kills
the
flavors
after
a
while
i
expected
a
bit
of
this
effect
from
the
style
but
not
quite
as
much
as
received
with
this
beer
ill
take
a
regular
aventinus
please
d
this
is
a
tremendous
dessert
beverage
skip
the
chocolate
cake
and
have
one
of
these
such
a
delicious
brew
perfect
dessert
beer
after
a
beefy
meal
good
when
fresh
better
when
aged
store
some
away
for
better
drinking
down
the
road
d
still
good
certainly
didnt
mellow
like
many
beers
but
i
think
i
will
split
the
rest
with
other
bas
too
much
for
one
sitting
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
will
look
fo
it
again
when
i
am
inthe
mood
for
an
eisbock
the
beer
pours
a
very
nice
little
head
that
falls
leaving
a
good
lacing
behind
the
color
is
very
dark
dark
amber
color
the
color
is
sweet
and
very
good
the
taste
is
wonderful
stuff
it
is
strong
with
great
flavors
of
the
original
weizenbock
the
mouthfeel
does
still
have
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
very
carbonated
overall
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
something
i
would
have
once
in
a
while
slightly
opaque
dark
amberbrown
brandy
body
two
fingers
of
dirty
offwhite
head
rapidly
dissipates
leaving
a
bubbly
ring
ripe
grapes
and
berries
on
the
nose
with
dark
chocolate
licorice
cedar
brandy
and
grape
puree
alcohol
is
there
too
but
not
up
front
very
complex
inviting
aromas
slight
tanginess
up
front
sweet
fruits
banana
grape
jam
pear
brandy
and
mild
smooth
chocolatecaramel
alcohol
comes
in
the
guise
of
sweet
tropical
fruits
and
bananas
and
plays
a
major
part
in
the
finish
accompanied
by
tangy
yeasty
malt
warming
and
liqueurish
a
sipper
vibrant
bubbly
carbonation
lifts
up
an
otherwise
fullbodied
syrupy
beer
more
drinkable
than
it
should
be
cheers
deep
walnut
brown
with
a
small
head
heavy
caramel
in
the
aroma
with
some
molasses
and
chcoclate
covered
cherries
the
same
flavors
are
echoed
in
the
taste
along
with
a
little
brown
sugar
and
cloves
well
carbonated
with
a
mediumfull
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
for
its
strength
this
is
a
really
nice
sipper
to
relax
with
something
to
bring
in
the
new
years
or
to
start
welcoming
the
new
year
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
lot
of
sediment
smells
quite
pruny
tastes
like
whoa
prune
juice
vodka
caramel
bit
of
apple
and
spices
and
all
of
it
quite
strong
overall
it
is
a
sipping
beer
and
one
you
must
approach
with
an
open
mind
definetly
not
a
session
beer
a
sipping
nightcap
type
beer
its
a
little
too
fruity
for
my
hoppy
palate
but
just
my
opinion
only
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
12oz
pint
glass
deep
rich
brown
color
with
a
1
5
inch
head
some
orange
hints
shining
in
through
the
light
overall
its
a
very
dark
and
even
cloudy
beer
very
interesting
looking
not
sure
if
ive
ever
really
seen
another
beer
quite
like
this
beautiful
bouquet
sweet
and
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
plum
raisin
and
prune
floral
and
fruity
but
not
citrusy
at
all
this
beer
smells
very
nice
quite
tasty
too
some
molasses
in
the
flavor
maybe
some
faraway
hints
of
vanilla
i
can
taste
some
banana
as
well
again
i
get
raisin
and
prune
in
the
taste
as
well
a
nice
hop
freshness
settles
in
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
as
well
very
rich
and
malty
like
a
good
bock
should
be
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
but
still
solid
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
in
one
setting
watch
out
for
the
high
alcohol
content
which
i
was
actually
unaware
of
when
i
purchased
it
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
bock
to
fans
of
the
genre
and
to
neophytes
alike
seriously
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
overall
this
is
a
beer
probably
for
a
more
refined
palette
than
mine
i
could
appreciate
the
fruitiness
but
the
alcohol
to
me
gave
the
beer
an
unpleasant
character
i
doubt
ill
try
it
again
this
is
a
new
must
have
for
my
beer
stash
this
beer
is
so
robust
maybe
the
ultimate
winter
warmer
still
it
comes
short
of
the
mighy
aventinus
but
not
by
much
this
is
a
nice
sipping
brew
personally
i
prefer
the
original
aventinus
but
this
is
a
nice
twist
on
it
sweet
thick
and
strong
too
much
for
more
than
one
but
one
to
sip
and
savor
is
nice
overall
this
is
above
average
but
not
excellent
i
prefer
their
other
weisen
oelergud
d
the
gargantuan
alcohol
burn
makes
this
a
slow
sipper
not
a
sessioner
but
i
will
return
to
this
once
in
a
while
when
there
is
time
to
slowly
enjoy
this
fine
brew
i
drank
this
by
candlelight
when
our
power
was
knocked
out
one
snowstormy
night
and
this
was
the
perfect
warming
beverage
for
the
occasion
pours
a
dark

some

rasinwith
a

nice

presence
this
is
a
big
tasting
beerbut
it
was
smoothand
easy
to
drink
d
very
tasty
and
not
filling
goes
down
easy
for
a
beer
with
such
a
high
abv
i
drank
it
pretty
quickly
but
if
i
were
drinking
a
second
i
go
a
little
slower
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
thick
swirling
sediment
permeates
the
caramel
highlighted
amber
body
fizzy
instantly
vanishing
head
of
big
tan
softdrink
inspired
bubbles
that
disappeared
completely
and
left
no
lacing
ample
carbonation
streams
pierce
the
surface
and
lend
the
appearance
of
soda
thick
aromas
of
alcohol
soaked
dark
fruits
cloves
bread
crust
and
bananas
the
taste
is
sweet
sticky
and
thick
with
cloves
bananas
and
plums
this
is
instantly
warming
light
peppery
carbonation
keeps
the
alcohol
drenched
cloves
moving
but
they
still
manage
to
hold
their
grip
through
the
finish
building
in
intensity
alongside
the
bananas
strong
wheat
beer
accents
have
been
bumped
up
and
given
a
medium
heat
alcohol
edge
slightly
drying
in
the
finish
this
is
certainly
aventinus
plus
and
enjoyable
but
i
prefer
the
regular
aventinus
drinkability
this
is
very
good
complex
and
rewarding
at
12
abv
it
is
obviously
not
sessionable
enjoy
in
small
quantities
and
with
food
the
mouth
is
medium
bodied
complex
with
an
wide
array
of
malty
and
elegantly
sugary
elements
interplaying
all
along
the
palate
ample
carbonation
preventing
it
from
ever
getting
syrupy
thus
its
quite
drinkable
and
damn
pleasing
from
start
to
finish
wonderful
drinks
okay
a
by
the
fire
sipper
very
nice
overall
but
only
for
a
nightcap
or
special
occasion
regular
aventinus
is
better
in
my
opinion
d
not
very
drinkable
in
large
doses
something
to
definitely
drink
occasionally
takes
a
while
to
get
through
a
pint
of
the
stuff
d
rather
good
dangerous
drinkable
for
a
12er
honestly
though
i
will
probably
never
have
this
beer
again
aventinus
is
vastly
superior
to
its
own
eisbock
counterpart
the
alchol
just
kills
the
beer
here
for
the
same
price
i
can
drink
more
aventinus
and
get
drunk
less
quickly
an
excellent
beer
but
with
a
better
cousin
this
ones
delicious
and
really
well
done
the
alcohol
is
wonderfully
mild
making
this
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
sipped
on
it
for
about
an
hour
drank
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
i
only
know
the
color
cuz
my
mom
asked
to
try
it
and
so
i
gave
her
a
little
bit
thinking
she
would
be
disgusted
by
it
but
she
thought
it
was
real
good
i
was
shocked
must
try
it
found
this
bottle
at
my
friends
house
while
housesitting
and
it
seems
to
be
at
least
a
couple
of
years
old
judging
the
label
i
saw
and
the
currently
used
version
of
the
label
he
did
say
help
myself
to
anything
the
beer
pours
a
dark
mahogony
almost
ebony
into
a
goblet
with
no
head
to
speak
of
and
what
appears
to
be
some
solids
yeasts
protiens
which
are
to
be
expected
based
on
how
this
beer
is
made
and
matured
the
nose
is
very
rich
and
sweet
with
a
little
alcohol
detectable
and
a
portlike
fruitiness
held
up
to
the
light
the
beer
reveals
a
soft
crimson
color
at
the
center
of
the
glass
surrounded
by
dark
edges
the
first
sip
surrounds
my
tounge
and
tastebuds
in
a
rich
velvety
sugarplum
sweetness
that
rounds
out
with
a
very
strong
alcohol
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
thick
full
warming
and
the
beer
finshes
smooth
with
a
subtle
hopiness
and
a
very
similar
tartness
to
a
nice
strong
barley
wine
the
second
sip
is
much
more
malty
and
reveals
the
distinct
wheat
flavor
of
the
weizenbock
bier
that
this
brew
began
as
and
the
many
levels
of
fruitiness
in
the
finish
date
fig
black
cherries
soaked
in
rum
overall
this
beer
is
a
very
complex
and
robust
example
of
an
eisbock
maybe
owing
a
good
amount
of
its
unique
character
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
weizen
bock
this
is
truly
an
amazing
beer
taste
yuck
all
alcohol
theres
way
too
much
booze
in
this
guy
i
greatly
enjoy
the
weizenbock
but
this
is
overdone
i
miss
the
banana
and
clove
notes
this
is
just
a
disgusting
mess
i
will
never
have
this
again
either
way
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
first
impression
tasty
but
the
sweetness
and
high
abv
would
make
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
i
really
enjoy
aventinus
so
i
hoped
this
would
be
a
natural
extension
in
fact
its
extraordinary
the
beer
pours
a
deep
rubybrown
color
with
thick
offwhite
foam
the
amount
of
head
is
remarkable
given
the
strength
of
the
brew
the
aroma
is
amazing
its
a
fabulous
mix
of
ultraripe
fruit
plums
raisins
banana
molasses
sugar
malt
and
spice
the
alcohol
gives
the
beer
a
strong
ethanol
smell
almost
like
a
fortified
wine
only
tempered
by
a
lot
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
explosively
goodintense
malt
and
wheat
flavors
sugary
and
syrupy
lots
of
warming
with
a
n
incredible
artesianal
breadlike
quality
its
like
drinking
alcoholic
wheatbread
syrup
thats
been
laced
with
fruit
and
spice
caramel
and
molasses
are
prominent
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
finish
is
a
marathon
of
lingering
flavors
with
a
liquorlike
warming
its
a
beer
thats
worthy
of
intermittently
short
sips
spaced
between
long
and
contemplative
sips
otherwise
the
intensity
can
be
very
overwhelming
and
tastebud
fatigue
can
slip
in
however
enjoyed
over
the
longterm
this
brew
is
exceptionally
rewarding

my
tastebuds
are
still
saying
wow
i
admire
this
version
as
much
as
regular
aventinus
albeit
for
the
deft
ice
filtering
and
clean
flavor
fantastici
wish
i
had
six
more
d
a

hard

its

it

pours
a
delicious
looking
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
bubbly
head
the
glass
it
comes
in
is
also
damn
sexy
the
nose
gives
a
lot
of
malt
yeast
acohol
and
sherry
when
i
drink
this
i
get
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
as
well
as
the
malt
from
the
nose
but
i
also
get
raisins
and
cherry
this
goes
down
creamy
with
light
carbonation
its
heavy
but
delicious
although
when
i
wad
one
it
felt
syrupy
and
cloying
i
can
do
12
of
these
max
mouthfeeldrinkability
delightfully
active
and
graceful
in
the
mouth
and
very
refined
i
was
expecting
something
maybe
along
the
lines
of
scaldis
with
its
big
abv
this
is
a
pleasure
so
full
of
character
almost
too
big
for
even
a
dessert
beer
yet
easy
drinking
yes
quite
a
paradox
this
is
a
difficult
beer
to
review
so
sample
one
for
yourself
and
tell
us
what
you
think
you
wouldnt
and
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
2
of
these
at
a
sitting
so
i
have
to
rate
this
a
bit
low
even
though
it
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
consumed
d
my
first
eisbock
review
i
dont
know
if
im
crazy
about
this
one
but
it
is
still
quite
good
and
seems
to
fit
the
style
description
perfectly
i
think
ill
try
this
one
again
on
a
cold
winter
night
d
2004
doesnt
seem
to
old
for
this
beer
but
i
feel
a
lot
of
the
flavors
are
muted
than
they
should
be
the
nose
was
the
first
hint
very
good
regardless
but
id
like
to
try
this
beer
with
a
bit
more
bite
so
i
know
what
im
missing
p
s
this
is
the
most
drunk
ive
ever
gotten
from
a
12
oz
bottle
so
be
forewarned
i
emphasize
the
word
nightcap
aventinus
overdid
themselves
with
this
beer
a
mistake
that
was
well
worth
being
mistaken
for
a
world
class
eisbock
drinkability
is
way
high
if
you
like
this
style
go
no
farther

truly
a
smooth
blankety
mouthfeel
without
feeling
like
you
have
sweaters
on
your
teeth
fizzy
only
when
swirled
and
settles
to
a
nearcreaminess
drinkable
no
worthy
to
be
sipped
savored
and
enjoyed
absolutely
probably
would
be
thicker
if
not
thinned
by
the
12
still
very
full
rich
and
moderately
syrupy
sweet
and
sticky
in
the
finish
but
with
remaining
power
and
strength
the
beer
improved
greatly
as
the
brew
warmed
to
room
temperature
and
expelled
its
pinprikling
carbonation
a
good
beer
alternative
to
a
port
wine
or
brandy
overall
this
is
my
first
expereince
with
the
eisbock
style
amazingly
rich
and
flavorful
drinkability
is
good
a
very
enjoyable
brew
big
on
taste
malty
is
growing
on
me
want
to
thank
babydoc
and
bcg
bif
for
this
bottle
im
keeping
in
mind
that
the
bottle
might
be
a
little
old
but
i
thought
for
the
abv
it
would
have
aged
fine
needless
to
say
i
didnt
enjoy
this
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
high
abv
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
but
what
i
really
marvel
at
is
how
well
the
alcohol
is
concealed
ive
had
many
brews
this
strong
or
nearly
so
and
none
of
them
concealed
the
alcohol
as
well
as
this
one
does
the
taste
kind
of
reminds
me
of
some
american
barley
wines
like
alesmith
or
stone
or
even
north
coasts
i
really
enjoy
the
flavors
here
mouth
is
smooth
with
low
carbonation
i
could
really
drink
lots
of
this
im
really
enjoying
this
one
dark
and
cloudy
teak
colored
beer
with
virtually
no
head
aroma
hints
at
sweet
flavors
with
cloves
figs
and
molasses
present
very
bakerypatisserie
type
smells
in
here
rich
warm
inviting
sweetness
on
display
on
the
palate
the
first
thing
to
show
itself
is
hugely
sweet
dates
then
a
flash
of
sour
fruit
comes
in
before
a
big
raw
alcoholic
burn
takes
over
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
back
of
the
throat
that
alcohol
burn
is
way
too
harsh
and
detracts
from
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
significantly
overall
interesting
effort
but
it
lacks
balance
and
subtlety
while
displaying
all
the
pitfalls
of
extreme
beers
still
i
can
imagine
that
if
you
want
a
warming
drink
in
the
winter
time
and
dont
want
to
drink
liquor
or
mulled
wine
this
would
do
beer
poured
deep
cloudless
mahogany
color
with
a
quick
fizzy
head
that
didnt
retain
very
well
and
left
no
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
was
quite
good
dark
complex
malts
with
strong
tones
of
dark
fruits
and
a
lingering
sweet
spiciness
the
scents
coming
from
this
one
are
quite
good
the
mouthfeel
was
a
thick
syrupy
maltiness
that
slid
about
and
around
the
tongue
and
left
lingering
alcohol
taste
on
the
pallette
the
beer
opens
up
and
allows
you
quick
glimpses
into
its
narrow
and
interesting
complexities
brown
sugar
and
raisons
along
with
other
flavors
poke
up
at
you
although
the
abv
is
aparent
at
the
finish
this
beer
remains
still
deliciously
drinkable
although
still
hindered
by
it
i
wouldnt
reach
for
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
on
a
single
sitting
but
i
would
drink
it
regularly
if
more
available
to
me

very

syrupy
hard
to
drink
on
a
warm
june
night
not
the
best
eisbock
i
have
had
but
it
shoul
age
very
well
i
think
i
will
buy
some
more
and
stash
them
away
this
one
was
just
too
young
the
taste
isnt
boozy
at
all
unlike
the
telling
smell
i
get
a
ton
of
alcohol
warmth
but
the
main
show
is
a
very
tender
yeast
and
wheat
it
reminds
me
of
cream
cheese
a
bit
very
soft
and
delicate
the
way
they
work
together
tons
of
dark
fruit
and
sweetness
work
their
way
around
in
here
especially
at
the
end
where
the
nice
spike
of
tartness
hits
i
half
expected
this
to
be
a
sludgefest
but
this
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
well
carbonated
im
sipping
this
thing
way
too
fast
and
the
crisp
finish
only
leaves
me
wanting
more
was
definitely
worse
when
it
was
cold
but
even
as
it
warmed
up
the
alcohol
was
just
too
much
i
felt
this
about
the
eku
as
well
too
bad
the
brown
body
starts
off
with
small
specks
of
a
head
that
quickly
disappear
alcohol
and
bananas
are
fighting
to
be
the
dominant
aroma
but
alcohol
wins
clove
and
phenols
are
also
in
the
nose
the
taste
has
all
of
the
above
as
well
as
a
bready
flavor
brown
sugar
and
a
cough
syrup
cherry
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
somewhat
sticky
this
has
good
drinkability
but
i
think
the
looming
12
abv
might
disagree
bottle
poured
a
deep
copper
color
beer
with
a
small
dark
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
is
just
plain
incredible
mix
of
dry
fruits
figs
prunes
and
raisins
with
some
floral
malt
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
sweet
fruit
aspect
but
doesnt
go
overboard
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
body
is
just
above
average
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
then
one
in
a
session
but
i
would
love
to
smell
this
aroma
over
and
over
again
this
pours
a
dark
burgandy
with
a
medium
head
the
smell
is
very
strong
almost
wine
like
with
alcohol
and
a
smoked
aroma
the
taste
is
very
powerful
and
concentrated
with
a
dark
fruit
flavoragain
winelike
with
a
smoked
wood
flavor
also
the
mf
is
heavy
with
the
flavors
all
mixing
well
for
a
beer
that
high
in
alcohol
this
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
that
should
not
be
missed

a
very
tasty
treat
and
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
beer
curiously
hangs
somewhere
in
the
limbo
between
a
fortified
dessert
wine
and
a
big
beer
it
definitely
needs
to
be
enjoyed
as
a
nightcap
like
a
glass
of
port
wine
or
perhaps
a
cordial
if
not
might
i
suggest
the
excellent
aventinus
weizenbock
instead
be
sure
to
drink
warm
all
the
good
properties
come
out
as
it
warms
i
was
pleasently
surprised
to
find
this
one
in
the
blue
mountains
of
sidney
poured
a
murky
eggplant
color
into
a
wine
glass
with
little
head
and
faint
ruby
hue
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
was
delicious
dark
over
ripe
prunes
red
wine
aromas
and
some
chocolate
notes
in
there
as
well
taste
was
heavenly
with
powdered
sugar
plum
wheat
chocolate
grape
the
complexities
were
nerely
innumerable
mouthfeel
was
also
a
plus
as
there
was
a
nice
hoppy
character
accompanying
the
wheat
and
fruit
flavors
making
for
a
melange
of
different
tastes
to
pick
up
on
this
is
some
pretty
strong
juice
so
for
the
unseasoned
beer
drinker
one
might
be
enough
however
i
think
a
couple
bottles
of
this
could
potentially
do
quite
nicely
for
just
about
anybody
wanting
to
try
an
exceptional
beer
experience
final
thoughts
fabulous
this
is
a
beer
with
some
great
complexities
going
on
not
only
is
it
a
great
style
of
beer
but
also
one
with
alot
of
personality
cheers
this
is
the
best
eisbock
ive
had
to
date
and
i
think
it
owes
quite
a
bit
to
the
wheat
if
you
like
the
original
aventinus
youll
love
the
eisbock
im
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
wont
be
making
a
habit
out
of
it
d
very
good
especially
considering
the
strength
thick
cream
colored
head
topped
this
dark
brown
beer
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
malt
with
hints
of
banana
and
alcohol
sneaking
in
for
the
ride
the
beer
was
very
thick
with
profound
malt
flavors
there
was
also
banana
and
hints
of
coffee
noticed
the
alcohol
left
the
mouth
dry
and
in
need
of
another
taste
this
was
a
very
good
beer
that
needs
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
over
a
period
of
time
if
not
the
alcohol
is
bound
to
sneak
up
on
you
ruddy
chestnut
colour
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
fine
bubbles
formed
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
bready
yeast
aroma
with
some
warm
alcohol
banana
clove
bubblesgum
and
a
vague
tropical
fruit
character
candy
sweetness
breadiness
and
banana
hit
the
palate
right
away
more
fruit
including
banana
comes
out
towards
the
end
spice
stays
quite
mild
throughout
great
depth
of
flavour
with
mild
alcohol
warmth
full
almost
heavy
body
low
carbonation
smooth
texture
with
some
dryness
due
to
the
alcohol
great
complexity
and
balance
very
enjoyable
thanks
northyorksammy
drinkability
a
potent
form
of
wheat
brew
a
good
pick
now
and
then
the
sweetness
of
this
seems
to
cloy
surprising
in
that
i
feel
regular
aventinus
is
the
nearperfection
of
balance
still
an
interesting
and
valid
big
beer
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
with
flavors
are
intersting
and
complex
the
high
abv
is
well
hidden
but
certainly
sneaks
up
on
you
make
sure
you
dont
have
anything
but
relaxing
to
do
right
after
drinking
this
one
pours
a
muddy
brown
with
a
thin
white
ring
of
head
amazingly
strong
weizen
aromas
of
banana
clove
and
bubblegum
im
truly
taken
aback
at
the
how
assertive
this
beer
is
while
smelling
it
i
in
no
way
have
to
stick
my
nose
in
the
glass
and
sniff
for
this
beers
character
its
all
upfront
ditto
on
the
flavors
tastes
like
weizen
concentrate
which
it
is
of
course
this
is
a
real
treat
for
anyone
who
loves
characteristic
german
wheat
flavors
the
only
area
that
the
taste
loses
points
in
is
that
i
feel
the
sweetness
could
be
put
a
little
more
in
check
aside
from
that
this
is
pretty
damned
stellar
does
a
great
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
full
and
fairly
slick
with
a
little
bite
on
the
tongue
i
am
impressed
with
how
drinkable
this
is
especially
at
its
alcoholic
strength
those
who
do
not
phenolic
beers
should
steer
clear
of
this
one
this
is
probably
not
a
great
session
beer
it
is
a
bit
high
in
alcohol
also
the
flavor
is
pretty
aggressive
it
is
a
good
beer
though
i
am
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
2
year
old
eisbock
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
murky
brown
with
no
head
at
all
but
some
mild
carbonation
smell
is
slightly
alcoholic
with
a
sweetness
of
wheat
extract
the
taste
is
enhanced
by
the
stellar
body
which
i
chewed
through
large
doses
of
clean
wheat
flavor
and
tight
yeast
flavor
mixed
with
a
good
alcohol
taste
fruityness
starts
to
bloom
in
the
middle
of
my
tongue
in
the
aftertaste
and
draws
me
back
for
more

however
its
for

again
absolutely
will
i
have
it
again
tonight
dont

could

it
is

kick

another
excellent
brew
from
this
brewery
deep

color
only
slight
head
after

there
is
an
abundance
of
chunky
sediment
throughout
this
one
which
kind
of
turns
me
off
a
bit
but
what
the
hell
i
still
think
it
will
be
good
i
even
tried
to
leave
behind
the
yeast
but
there
was
no
stopping
it
aroma
is
a
nice
rasiny
chocolate
alcoholic
experience
taste
is
sweet
for
a
second
then
overpowered
by
raisiny
alcohol
that
carries
through
the
finish
and
beyond
the
malt
flavor
is
mostly
dark
fruit
with
a
hint
of
spice
much
like
a
dubbel
or
grand
cru
the
mouthfeel
runs
even
a
bit
thin
not
syrupy
as
expected
carbonation
is
adequate
its
quite
smooth
i
dont
really
detect
any
grainy
or
chunkyness
despite
what
i
could
see
in
the
appearance
a
good
strong
malt
flavor
overall
but
alcoholic
enough
that
you
might
want
to
just
have
one
of
these
and
then
switch
to
something
less
potent
overall
i
like
the
dark
melanoidin
malt
profile
and
its
sneaky
strength
the
phenols
are
spicy
and
compliment
the
malt
very
well
im
a
little
worried
about
the
lack
of
esters
but
dont
really
miss
them
a
great
multifaceted
brew
good
job
needs
more
dextrins
for
improved
head
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
each
but
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
the
original
aventinus
weizenbock
perhaps
because
of
the
ridiculously
high
abv
i
can
only
imagine
having
1
at
a
time
but
i
enjoyed
this
time
and
look
forward
to
the
next
poured
into
my
pils
glass
a
rush
of
carbonation
bubbles
race
to
the
top
but
no
head
remains
after
the
initial
pour
caramel
figs
plums
and
grapes
are
the
main
things
i
get
from
the
first
noseful
the
malts
dominate
the
the
full
body
leaving
a
sweet
syrupy
and
fruity
finish
the
alcohol
only
enters
into
the
equation
as
it
hits
my
stomach
at
3
00
a
bottle
this
is
a
steal
for
whats
inside
this
seems
to
be
a
beer
that
opens
up
as
you
drink
it
revealing
more
layers
along
the
way
and
i
imagine
that
goes
for
subsequent
samplings
drinkability
definitly
not
a
session
beer
has
a
pretty
high
alcohol
content
and
rich
taste
so
its
a
sipper
i
dunno
as
i
would
buy
another
i
have
had
a
couple
other
eisbocks
i
have
enjoyed
more
at
a
lower
price
a
very
nice
beer
for
sippimg
after
dinner
or
on
a
cold
winter
day
smooth
and
easy
to
sip
d
the
density
of
the
elements
and
the
high
alcohol
content
make
this
an
excellent
sipping
beer
for
the
winter
months
a
simple
creation
when
one
considers
its
core
tastes
of
brown
sugar
rum
and
plums
yet
its
depth
is
its
strength
each
element
heightened
to
an
elegant
extremity
excellent
for
drinking
while
discussing
seminal
issues
with
good
friends
or
pondering
works
of
art
alone
in
the
semidarkness
i
guess
ill
stick
to
the

is

the

overall
not
my
favorite
eisbock
as
the
aventinus
eisbock
is
a
tough
act
to
follow
however
it
is
pretty
darned
tasty
loaded
with
a
depth
that
cool
temperatures
can
mask
id
repeat
this
beer
were
i
to
stumble
upon
it
on
tap
anywhere
or
find
it
on
a
shelf
in
a
place
where
the
aventinus
were

it

it

there

overall
i
have
a
few
differnt
eisbocks
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
ever
since
i
had
the
aventinus
eisbock
which
is
absolutely
world
class
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
this
didnt
quite
live
up
to
that
high
bar
but
it
is
still
a
good
brew
that
is
worth
trying
inside
the
style
straight
up
pour
gives
a
one

brown

vanishes

westborough
ma
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
because
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
from
the
taste
and
its
not
very
malty
or
fullbodied
in
nature
poured
a
brownish
body
with
one
finger
offwhite
head
and
some
lace
on
top
of
an
aroma
that
was
strong
almost
like
a
sticky
sweet
smell
if
that
makes
sense
barley
malt
aplenty
yeast
pokes
out
and
some
darksweet
fruit
the
brew
is
creamy
smooth
the
yeast
makes
it
fluffy
on
the
tongue
and
easy
to
pass
with
a
balance
of
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
and
good
malts
that
border
on
roasted
and
some
fruit
flavors
that
border
sweet
fruit
and
dark
fruit
but
i
cant
really
pinpoint
them
there
are
not
really
any
citric
type
fruits
like
orange
that
sometimes
poke
out
with
a
good
amount
of
yeast
in
a
beer
but
the
finish
is
a
little
crisp
and
these
bitter
citric
hops
poke
out
on
the
finish
overpowering
the
sweet
malts
and
dryer
malts
a
very
good
beer
that
has
a
great
balance
of
hearty
maltiness
and
sweetness
o
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
eisbock
with
the
sour
tastes
kind
of
interesting
it
really
grows
on
you
as
ypou
drink
it
so
give
it
a
chance
d
well
it
smells
amazing
but
the
flavor
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
the
tartness
isnt
unpleasant
but
it
is
odd
and
im
not
sure
if
it
was
intentional
or
not
overall
it
is
a
good
brew
but
a
more
traditional
version
with
more
sweetness
in
the
finish
would
have
been
better
an
amazing
beer
and
one
that
makes
me
understand
why
a
brewery
would
make
an
eisbock
the
concentration
of
flavor
in
this
beer
is
flat
out
amazing
notes
dam
this
snarling
beast
has
big
sharp
pointy
teeth
with
a
sinister
malt
backbone
did
i
mention
this
beer
is
incredibly
sweet
cheers
thanks

notes
nice
offering
does
not
make
it
to
the
notch
of
the
very
few
eisbocks
ive
tried
but
it
is
pretty
good
repeating
this
rarity
is
unlikely
given
the
price
tag
which
might
be
its
biggest
flaw
i
really
enjoyed
the
cuvee
barrique
from
schneider
sohn
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
applaud
their
creativity
with
this
series
but
i
think
this
beer
could
have
been
done
much
better
i
certainly
wouldnt
purchase
it
again
at
the
high
price
overall
this
is
another
phenomenal
offering
from
weisses
bräuhaus
g
schneider
sohn
everything
they
do
is
exceptional
and
this
is
no
exception
a
perfect
example
of
a
an
eisbock
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
bottom
line
rare
interesting
beer
o
figs
not
raisins
define
this
wonderful
example
of
an
eisboch
the
beer
displays
a
dark
brown
burgundy
body
appearing
nearly
still
nice
aroma
featuring
port
sherry
oak
dark
fruit
plums
figs
smooth
and
complex
this
one
drinks
like
a
port
wine
or
after
dinner
digestif
alcohol
presence
is
there
but
not
overpowering
by
any
means
light
to
medium
in
body
with
no
carbonation
a
fun
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
this
was
a
recommended
pick
from
my
local
craft
beer
store
geek
although
the
bottle
is
11
2
oz
i
suggest
you
share
this
in
sherry
glasses
and
not
a
full
glass
pour
very
rich
would
be
a
great
after
dinner
beer
to
share
with
a
group
of
friends
the
complex
ale
really
shift
from
sip
to
sip
to
give
new
flavors
and
textures
along
the
way
but
as
it
tells
a
remarkable
story
its
sour
twang
pushes
it
slightly
over
the
edge
as
it
begins
to
impede
drinkability
and
its
sultry
malt
character
overall
was
excited
to
try
this
as
eisbocks
can
be
so
hard
to
come
by
it
was
therefore
disappointed
by
the
lightness
of
the
flavor
and
aroma
as
well
as
by
the
lack
of
melanoidins
the
bananabubblegumclove
combination
was
strong
enough
to
have
fooled
me
into
thinking
this
was
a
dunkelweizen
still
this
was
a
tasty
beer
with
some
interesting
characteristics
to
keep
a
sipper
occupied
definitely
sip
this
beer
if
you
can
chug
a
mug
of
this
beer
and
survive
youre
a
better
man
than
i
am
or
woman
did
i
mention
boozy
overall
interesting
stuff
wine
barrel
aging
definitely
mellowed
this
out
and
added
some
additional
complexity
biggest
complaint
is
that
it
was
completely
flat
while
flat
can
work
for
some
beers
a
little
carbonation
would
have
gone
a
long
way
on
this
one
overall
the
maturity
in
the
pinot
noir
barrels
makes
this
beer
delicious
and
balances
out
the
sweetness
qualities
well
im
going
to
have
a
hard
time
finding
this
one
again
o
this
is
a
very
pleasant
sipping
beerit
definitely
tastes
strongbut
the
alcohol
does
not
detract
from
the
taste
overall
incredibly
unique
experience
well
balanced
and
nice
to
see
from
a
german
brewer
