top

barley
wine
good
on
a
cold
night
absoutely
fantastic
almost
closer
to
a
port
than
a
beer
where
can
i
find
more
sweeter
barleywine
no
carbonation
decent
offering
but
not
for
everyone
tastes
sweet
with
dark
caramel
upfront
and
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
which
somehow
survives
in
the
aftertaste
feels
syrupy
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
absolutely
fantastic
o
i
got
this
on
wishbeer
thailand
drank
in
kunming
on
january
9th
2015
its
that
time
of
year
to
have
this
one
especially
on
the
day
of
the
first
snow
in
our
city
memories
of
having
barley
wine
with
my
bro
in
canada
this
around
this
time
of
year
whoa
this
is
a
wiley
monster
poured
with
a
traditional
tiny
fine
offwhite
head
a
little
lace
and
a
hazycloudy
dark
honey
amber
color
aroma
is
wet
grain
malt
figs
a
bit
of
citrus
a
hint
of
yeast
flavor
is
like
aroma
but
the
first
thing
that
jumps
out
is
the
sweet
tartness
the
citrus
is
an
interesting
twist
for
barley
wine
it
pretty
much
hides
most
of
the
malt
the
body
is
perfect
alcohol
is
well
hidden

poured
deep

with
a

perfectly
clear
the

produces
a
brilliant
deep

lots
of

here
very
nicely
balanced
sweetness
that
lasts
the
entire
sip
followed
by
an
earthy

low
carbonation
works
for
this
sipper
thick
and
chewy
body
quite
an
awesome
beer
indeed
there
is
almost
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
which
is
impressive
there
are
lots
of
mineralchalk
in
this
one
a
bit
too
much
i
think
o
the
label
says
this
can
age
for
25
years
wouldnt
this
just
get
sweeter
and
sweeter
over
time
anyway
this
was
interesting
to
try
but
i
think
i
would
have
preferred
a
fresher
bottle
with
a
stronger

overall
this
is
big
very
big
maybe
too
big
very
sweet
and
lots
of
grainy
flavors
every
time
i
have
this
im
reminded
that
its
just
not
really
my
thing
the
cascade
dry
hopped
version
was
excellent
as
the
hop
flavor
overtook
the
sweet
grainy
flavor
that
can
be
so
dominating
here
lets
see
how
the
bordeaux
version
is
overall
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
not
worth
trying
especially
at
the
price
point
its
a
very
simple
brew
but
the
few
notes
it
does
have
are
not
particularly
enjoyable
and
the
body
comes
off
thin
for
what
should
be
a
huge
barley
wine
and
i
still
got
the
cascade
dryhopped
and
bordeaux
barrel
aged
version
to
review
d
fantastic
bold
and
rich
barleywine
great
overall
balance
overall
a
good
and
super
strong
barley
wine
id
like
to
try
one
after
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
the
mouth
lets
it
down
just
not
pleasant
to
drink
no
carbonation
whatsoever
a
real
shame
because
the
flavour
profile
is
really
nice
bottle
courtesy
of
ygtbsm94
served
in
a
sampler
glass
pours
a
medium
caramel
color
with
no
real
head
though
none
is
expected
from
a
brew
like
this
nose
is
strong
malt
and
sweetness
with
some
fruit
in
the
background
flavor
has
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
drowning
out
some
of
the
subtleties
from
the
nose
mediumfull
body
a
bit
viscous
some
booze
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
standup
barleywine
that
hides
its
deadly
abv
nicely
just
a
bit
too
sweet
o
very
intense
barleywine
very
big
very
sweet
and
fruity
a
sipper
for
sure
especially
since
it
is
dead
flat
but
surprisingly
not
as
harsh
as
youd
think
and
surprisingly
balanced
for
what
you
get
to
be
honest
i
enjoyed
it
as
a
really
unique
and
strong
barleywine
o
i
dont
see
this
beer
going
anywhere

some

loads
of
residual

has
an
oily

with

and
loads
of
alcohol
was
apparent
this
was
bottle
in
2010
and
is
supposedly
good
for
another
25
years
i
cant
say
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
as
way
too
much
alcohol
and
sugar
was
perceptible
there
seems
to
be
a
trend
of
zero
carbonation
and
highgravity
beer
with
no
attenuation
and
i
just
dont
get
it
verdict
so
much
potential
here
wonderful
aroma
great
flavorings
but
just
poor
delivery
the
lack
of
any
carbonation
ruins
any
hope
of
having
a
good
experience
with
this
beer
perhaps
its
just
the
age
of
the
bottle
and
maybe
some
oxidation
setting
in
although
it
really
didnt
taste
like
that
was
the
case
and
many
other
reviewers
even
of
fresher
bottles
have
complained
about
the
mouthfeel
as
well
so
im
not
convinced
i
originally
gave
this
one
a

it
gets
considerably

beer
is
like
port
raisins
and
grapes
with
a
fortified
liquor
quality
to
it
interesting
but
not
great
i
liked
it
but
wouldnt
have
much
of
it
strong
syrupy
aroma
is
rather
sweet
not
really
like
beer
at
all
with
notes
of
molasses
and
honey
it
pours
a
clear
dark
cola
brown
with
a
skimpy
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
long
flavor
is
quite
sweet
more
like
wine
than
beer
and
watch
out
for
that
alcohol
bite
well
look
at
the
abv
and
then
wonder
why
it
bites
like
an
angry
pit
bull
texture
is
rather
like
a
hard
liquor
mainly
raw
alcohol
bite
with
some
sweet
and
fruity
and
molasses
hints
i
prefer
a
beer
that
smells
tastes
and
feels
like
beer
however
different
strokes
for
different
folks
best
in
small
quantities
i
certainly
enjoyed
my
portion
i
would
have
this
again
ebu
53
9
de
molen
rocks
when
it
comes
to
their
wide
range
of
imperial
stouts
but
otherwise
their
successes
are
few
and
far
between
imo
o
this
is
so
sweet
i
cant
handle
it
its
as
thick
as
eggnog
too
some
carbonation
in
this
would
bring
it
back
to
life
but
there
is
none
too
bad
these
small
pieces
bring
down
an
otherwise
excellent
beer
o
good
quality
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
well
balanced
between
esters
malt
and
bitters
i
cellared
one
and
imagine
this
will
be
excellent
in
5
to
10
years
particular
it
is
however
that
the
beer
which
is
to
settle
so
that
there
is
a
slight
emulsion
the
bottom
of
the
glass
remains
in
place
which
is
similar
to
the
grenadine
o
pretty
basic
barleywine
but
a
pretty
sweet
one
the
abv
is
there
but
you
cant
really
tell
its
at
15
o
really
tasty
and
very
flavorful
but
it
would
help
out
if
it
was
carbonated
impressive
stuff
though
i
cant
really
think
of
any
other
beer
that
fits
this
much
of
a
malt
profile
into
the
flavor
with
this
high
of
an
abv
without
being
obscenely
boozey
glad
to
try
it
and
i
wonder
how
a
bottle
would
taste
with
25
years
of
age
on
it
a
sweet
and
sticky
dessert
the
bottle
is
about
3
years
old
though
still
over
barring
and
unpleasant
not
something
i
will
touch
again
for
a
long
long
time
if
ever
surprisingly
this
is
also
my
mothers
favourite
of
all
the
beers
i
have
given
her
this
goes
well
with
bj
super
fudge
chunk
and
whipped
cream
interesting
bottle
very
artisanal
label
with
a
thin
rather
oily
red
wax
coating
over
the
metal
cap
pour
was
dark
chestnut
with
little
head
very
low
level
of
carbonation
bordering
on
flat
heavy
dose
of
brown
sugar
with
prune
and
dried
fruit
in
the
background
etoh
was
prominent
and
biting
stabbing
through
the
sweetness
with
a
jagged
edge
finish
was
overlysweet
and
cloying
unfortunately
im
just
not
digging
this
beer
syrupy
feel
to
it
no
carbonation
and
that
surprises
me
a
little
bit
given
the
abv
and
bottle
conditioning
boozey
on
the
end
glad
it
was
the
small
bottle
o
obviously
too
strong
to
drink
more
than
one
of
and
the
one
i
drank
took
me
some
time
a
definite
sipper
but
very
enjoyable
ill
definitely
be
picking
some
more
of
this
up
to
see
how
it
ages
the
bottle
claims
it
can
stand
up
after
25
years
in
a
cellar
overall
thanks
to
my
buddy
for
a
fantastic
birthday
present
that
included
this
a
very
unique
and
wonderful
concoction
overall
not
bad
but
not
10
good
i
much
prefer
the
heaven
and
hell
which
is
also
by
brouwerij
de
molen
but
costs
1
less
wont
be
purchasing
again
far
too
sweet
for
me
overall
not
de
molens
finest
work
but
a
dangerously
drinkable
abv
monster
i
would
like
to
see
what
time
does
to
this
beer
though
it
says
on
the
back
you
can
age
it
up
to
25
years
maybe
i
am
drinking
it
prematurely
but
who
knows
330cl
bottle
from
bruery
provisions
bottle
20132304
pours
cloudy
mahogany
with
no
head
and
some
floaties
aroma
has
loads
of
fruitgreen
apple
orange
some
caramel
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
end
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
it
doesnt
show
15
not
bad
but
not
terribly
complex
overall
i
think
this
is
far
too
boozy
od
nice
barleywine
nice
and
fruity
and
refreshing
on
the
sunny
day
weak
aroma
but
flavour
is
what
counts
for
me
so
this
was
good
d
a
good
english
barlewyine
much
too
strong
for
everyday
enjoyment
but
a
good
sipper
to
enjoy
the
bottle
says
this
can
be
cellared
for
up
to
25
years
i
would
be
curious
to
put
this
to
the
test
and
see
what
happens
a
good
english
barleywine
with
nice
flavours
the
alcohol
levels
are
very
noticeable
but
on
the
whole
it
works
cheers
molen
notes
quite
a
progression
brew
if
one
likes
it
this
is
the
one
that
goes
from
blah
appearance
to
quite
outstanding
id
love
to
have
a
couple
around
for
the
aging
thanks
toño
once
again
for
the
treat
d
it
says
it
can
age
25
years
and
i
believe
it
a
good
place
to
start
definitely
needs
to
age
and
bring
more
complexities
to
the
forefront
glad
to
try
it
overall
kind
of
a
let
down
ive
got
another
bottle
and
given
that
it
says
it
can
age
25
years
maybe
ill
give
that
a
go
it
is
very
drinkable
especially
given
the
abv
yeah
a
very
heavy
drop
but
it
is
quite
pleasant
for
the
most
part
a
good
sipper
could
see
it
being
served
as
an
afterdinner
beer
no
this
is
too
much
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
a
beer
that
has
gone
way
too
far
one
way
and
has
become
unbalanced
and
difficult
to
drink
maybe
youre
not
meant
to
drink
it
maybe
youre
meant
to
pour
it
over
ice
cream
as
some
sort
of
sickly
delicious
sugar
syrup
but
as
a
beer
even
to
sip
its
beyond
redemption
d
its
a
sipper
but
remarkably
easy
drinking
for
a
15
abv
undercarbed
barleywine
im
probably
going
to
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
as
im
very
curious
how
this
will
do
with
some
age
on
it
in
all
not
as
good
as
others
i
ve
had
but
may
have
it
again
not
what
i
want
out
of
a
beer
but
certainly
an
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
truly
something
that
people
will
enjoy
and
certainly
worthy
of
having
sampled
at
12
bucks
a
bottle
over
a
dollar
and
oz
wont
be
something
i
do
again
and
frankly
im
ok
with
that
overall
the
smell
was
really
incredible
but
the
taste
was
just
down
right
unpalatable
all
in
all
an
interesting
brew
its
a
phenomenal
sipper
but
not
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
something
needs
to
be
done
about
that
mouthfeel
before
i
give
this
one
another
look
just
too
flat
dbig
malt
bomb
a
little
sweet
but
not
cloying
the
huge
flavors
and
the
big
body
go
well
together
more
carbonation
would
probably
have
helped
balance
and
reduce
some
of
the
big
sugar
flavors
in
this
this
barleywine
is
as
classic
flavored
as
they
come
similar
to
the
wellaged
j
w
lees
and
tom
hardys
ales
overall
this
was
a
big
still
barleywine
certainly
on
the
sweet
side
but
after
a
certain
abv
its
almost
impossible
to
make
them
otherwise
id
enjoy
seeing
beers
over
12
available
in
the
rogue
nip
bottles
as
12
oz
is
almost
always
too
much
anyways
its
a
tasty
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
sipper
very
sweet
like
a
dessert
wine
not
the
best
body
in
a
barleywine
but
pretty
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
all
in
all
this
was
a
good
brew
had
some
interesting
notes
to
it
the
taste
was
a
lot
better
than
the
scent
gave
of
and
the
drinkability
was
a
lot
better
than
you
would
have
thought
for
15
abv

pours
a
rich
dark
brown
colour
with
a
little
head
noneby
the
end
of
the
bottle
fairly
full
mouthfeel
supplemented
by
lots
of
caramel
this
is
sweet
and
apricot
fruity
very
sweet
this
is
one
year
old
of
its
stated
25
year
life
and
should
be
even
more
interesting
after
five
years
drinkable
and
super
high
alcohol
is
hidden
750ml
courtesy
of
rbs
own
madmitch76
the
pour
is
orange
copper
with
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
really
pungent
and
fruity
with
apricots
and
pears
to
go
along
with
spicy
to
earthy
hops
and
some
mild
heat
at
the
end
of
the
draw
the
taste
is
sweet
syrupy
with
malts
pears
skinless
ripe
red
apple
wedges
and
apricot
fruitiness
it
smoothly
moves
into
notes
of
spicy
and
earthy
hops
the
booze
kicks
in
and
helps
dry
it
out
at
the
end
to
help
balance
out
the
load
of
sweetness
going
on
here
overall
not
what
i
expected
the
beer
is
really
too
sweet
for
my
pellet
it
needs
a
bit
more
bitterness
to
balance
the
taste
the
alcohol
however
is
extremely
well
hidden
i
wish
alcohol
was
this
well
hidden
in
my
favorite
barley
wine
the
sam
smith
strong
golden
the
absence
of
any
carbonation
and
lack
of
bitterness
makes
this
beer
more
like
a
very
sweet
liquor
nice
for
after
dinner
but
not
if
one
wants
a
beer
d
if
there
wouldnt
be
the
grains
this
could
be
mistaken
for
an
italian
desert
wine
like
malvasia
with
some
carbonation
and
some
aging
to
reduce
the
sugar
content
this
might
have
been
a
great
barley
wine
im
waiting
until
i
hear
about
a
batch
with
carbonation
then
i
will
surely
try
and
review
it
again
d
a
really
good
beer
very
taste
and
characterful
its
definitely
a
sipper
but
its
impressive
that
a
beer
as
sweet
as
this
one
is
so
balanced
the
vinous
and
liqueurlike
qualities
in
this
one
is
superb
but
it
would
have
been
so
nice
if
there
was
some
carbonation
750ml
bottle
from
the
may
08
brewing
the
cork
comes
loose
silently
and
pouring
it
proves
there
is
indeed
very
little
carbonation
if
any
the
beer
is
surprisingly
clear
with
a
bright
copper
body
and
some
traces
of
a
wouldbe
foam
collar
looks
like
a
liqueur
and
the
similarities
dont
stop
there
smells
incredibly
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
fruit
notes
lots
of
orange
character
very
boozy
taking
a
big
whiff
it
burns
the
nostrils
caramel
brown
sugar
and
honey
in
the
taste
again
with
a
good
deal
of
fruit
there
is
a
surprising
amount
of
bitterness
there
though
its
easily
overpowered
by
the
sweet
finish
no
real
alcohol
bite
just
a
very
warming
finish
thick
feel
that
is
quite
syrupy
normally
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
really
go
for
but
i
think
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
really
what
lets
it
work
rather
than
thinking
about
this
as
a
beer
it
comes
off
as
being
much
more
akin
to
a
typical
dessert
liqueur
definitely
a
sipper
and
not
something
i
want
to
have
more
than
a
6oz
serving
of
but
then
again
one
can
just
recork
the
bottle
and
not
have
to
worry
about
losing
carbonation
really
interesting
for
what
it
is
sampled
on
tap
at
the
prezbf
festival
at
alivnne
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
orange
body
with
an
off
white
head
that
ran
away
rather
quickly
the
nose
had
yeast
notes
some
citrus
character
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
well
the
taste
was
pretty
intense
with
some
alcohol
notes
fruit
character
orange
and
a
nice
hop
character
and
spice
as
well
overall
a
full
bodied
beer
that
improved
as
it
warms
and
the
nose
and
body
open
up
i
had
7
bottles
of
the
stuff
6
of
them
from
a
batch
in
march
and
1
from
june
the
brewer
already
mentioned
that
he
was
more
satisfied
with
the
second
batch
and
oh
my
god
what
a
great
evening
filling
beer
this
is
the
first
batch
was
great
but
it
looked
horrible
and
imo
it
was
also
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
the
second
batch
however
is
a
real
improvement
on
those
faults
the
beer
is
still
very
sweet
but
in
a
good
way
because
of
the
strong
bitterness
underneath
and
the
filling
thickness
its
a
dessertbeer
for
sure
after
a
good
heavy
meal
you
should
open
up
a
bottle
and
when
done
finish
it
off
with
a
glass
of
lagavulin
to
make
the
evening
perfect
im
glad
i
have
5
bottles
left
lets
see
how
they
develop
over
the
next
5
years

no

it

is
a
very
nice
blend
of

and
sweet

much
like
a

after

maybe
a

also
some
notes
of

and
a
burning
at

sized

follows
the
aroma
with
oranges
and

dominating

rides
over

behind
these
flavors
sweet
sugary
caramel
blends
with
a
bite
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
side
due
to
the
nearly
nonexistant
carbonation
slightly
syrupy
but
not
too
heavy
at
least
in
moderate
quantities
bite
of
alcohol
towards
the
finish
leads
into
a
very
warming
finish
perfect
for
a
cold
night
a
nice
treat
from
de
molen
i
felt
the
lack
of
carbonation
was
both
pleasing
in
that
it
allowed
some
strong
sweet
liqueur
like
flavors
to
come
thru
but
also
allows
the
sugariness
to
come
thru
possibly
limiting
how
much
one
can
enjoy
in
a
sitting
a
delicious
sipper
imo
the
lowno
carbonation
and
sweetness
make
for
a
fine
night
cap
glad
to
have
one
to
lay
down
for
a
few
years
and
see
what
develops
overall
an
amazing
beer
nose
is
potentially
the
best
of
a
barleywine
ive
ever
had
just
love
the
huge
dark

also

cant

other

of
this

i
would
rank
ahead
of
this
maybe
j
w
lees
off
the

of

this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
barleywine

if
you
find

dont
pay

just
buy

barleywine
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
this
was
amazing
it
tasted
similar
to
bcbs
the
best
barley
wine
ive
ever
had
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
consider
this
to
be
a
pretty
well
balanced
example
of
the
style
bourbon
is
present
but
not
overpowering
i
would
think
for
someone
that
is
looking
for
a
starter
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
is
would
be
a
nice
one
to
try
a
very
balanced
and
tasty
barleywine
this
was
rated
a
5
at
first
at
a
beer
share
now
i
dropped
it
because
the
flavor
is
too
sweet
to
drink
an
entire
bottle
amazing
beer
though
however
o
absolutely
amazing
usually
i
prefer
this
beer
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
but
the
freshness
of
the
base
beer
coupled
with
the
handsdown
best
bourbon
barrel
technique
has
this
beer
in
a
class
of
its
own
sucuba
sit
back
down
the
chocolate
and
barrel
flavor
combine
for
a
bit
of
a

for
sure
enjoyed
it

from
a

trying

was

lucky
to
taste
a

a
week
ago
i
know
this
had
a
great
smooth
feel
great
smell
and
very
unique
first
time
taste
to
me
but
this
style
is
too
sweet
for
me

to
say

is

taste

just
wow
for
a

with
no

on
it
it
blends
so
well
with
some
alcohol
presence
starts
with
a
smooth
vanilla
and
caramel
which
gives
way
to
plenty
of
malt
oak
tobacco
dark
fruits
and
bourbon
finishes
with
a
nice
hop
presence
temporarily
which
gives
way
to
a
creamy
and
boozy
finish
mouthfeel
holy
crap
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
mouthfeels
ive
ever
had
with
a
beer
so
syrupy
and
creamy
very
dangerous
i
really
think
i
could
session
this
with
ease
which
is
surprising
given
what
it
is
overall
an
amazing
experience
im
really
surprised
i
like
this
way
better
than
bcbs
and
im
more
of
a
stout
guy
this
lives
up
to
the
billing
rich
malty
dark
dried
fruity
flavor
with
traces
of
vanilla
bourbon
and
oak
consistency
was
delightful
i
love
bourbon
but
once
again
i
just
dont
enjoy
a
bcbs
product
overall
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
in
many
ways
it
was
like
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
but
what
sets
it
apart
were
the
nuances
for
example
the
hint
of
caramelized
dried
dark
fruits
and
the
full
deep
body
t
has
a
mellow
character
bordering
on
blasé
moments
of
molasses
some
dark
bready
malts
dried
plums
grapes
some
oxidated
metallic
definition
of
balance
would
pair
very
well
with
cheese
a
very
mature
beer
while
2013
has
a
bit
more
port
warmth
thinner
body
earthy
grain
taste
and
more
bourbon
compared
to
2014
which
had
more
plumport
fruit
and
fig
sweetness
to
it
id
be
curious
to
see
if
it
translated
in
to
a
side
by
side
bottle
comparison
i
like
this
it
is
pretty
good
excellent
great
mouth
feel
and
taste
slightly
sweeter
than
bourbon

stout
overall
my
favorite

to

excellente
king

bcbw
are
the

both
super
premium
to
enjoy
highly
recommended
all
the
time
tasted

wasnt
as
boozy
and
hot
as
i
was
expecting
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
dark
sugar
sweetness
zero
head
and
lacing
with
an
oily
mouthfeel
it
was
very
good
but
drinks
more
like
liquor
than
a
beer
overall
this
barleywine
is
fantastic
this
beer
has
the
right
notes
in
the
right
places
in
the
right
degrees
excuse
me
why
are
they
still
selling
this
as
if
it
wasnt
the
best
of
the
whole
collection
i
was
able
to
get
one
of
all
the
bourbon
county
release
and
this
by
far
has
the
most
flavor
of
the
collection
by
the
way
i
dont
noally
like
barley

thank
your

very
fortunate
to
be
able
to
track
this
down
in

after
years
of
wanting
to

this

i
just

this

this
is
an

although
i
was
a

underwhelmed

through
the

could

the
strong

that
was
a
bit
overpowering
personally
i
think
the
uinta
anniversary
barleywine
is
a
more
balanced
example
of
the
style
o
an
incredibly
wellconstructed
complex
beer
however
i
would
like
to
revisit
after
additional
aging
there
is
a
bit
of
a
bite
that
i
didnt
get
in
the
13
vintage
that
should
smooth
out
over
time
still
quite
fantastic
as
is
o
great
beer
liked
it
slightly
more
than
bcbs
2014
version
pours
a
dark
cola
with
a
light
tan
ring
of
a
head
aroma
of
big
bourbon
booze
vanilla
damp
wood
and
a
touch
of
coconut
taste
is
much
like
other
bc
ales
that
smack
you
around
with
the
intense
sweetness
unlike
many
others
syrupy
with
dark
fruits
toffee
caramels
and
more
oakyvanilla
notes
feel
is
creamy
somewhat
boozy
and
silky
smooth
obviously
a
very
solid
ba
barleywine
right
there
with
sucaba
but
a
step
or
2
below
straight
jacket
for
me
one
of
the
best
beers
you
will
ever
have
o
my
favorite
bcbs
variant
so
far
and
one
of
the
best
beers
got
lucky
and
stumbled
upon
this
one
definitely
glad
i
grabbed
one
and
had
to
see
what
all
the
hype
was
about
deep
color
and
strong
smooth
taste
smells
great
with
an
even
better
after
taste
this
is
a
truly
delicious
beer
maybe
its
unfair
to
compare
as
they
are
completely
different
beers
but
its
not
quite
on
the
level
of
bcbs
for
me
this
drinks
like
a
port
wine
and
makes
an
excellent
digestif
definitely
the
best
barleywine
available
imho
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
consumed
i
was
very
impressed
with
how
well
the
alcohol
was
masked
this
brew
was
not
oversweetened
which
really
brought
out
the
best
flavors
in
the
malts
a
must
have
year
after
year
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
from
my
experience
this
is
the
most
complex
bourbon
county
beer
i
have
had
compared
to
bcbs
and
bcbcs
and
borderline
my
favorite
though
im
a
sucker
for
stouts
in
my
mind
this
had
always
been
the
younger
brother
of
the
two
yearly
bigs
bcbs
and
bcbcs
but
this
has
earned
a
big
deal
of
respect
from
me
utterly
fantastic
i
also
made
sure
i
wasnt
eating
anything
during
the
tasting
wanted
my
palate
clean
this
was
one
of
those
ales
where
you
just
want
it
to
never
leave
your
mouth
its
that
delectable
for
my
first
bourbon
county
beer
this
one
greatly
exceeded
my
expectations
overall
a
really
great
barleywine
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
great
complex
mix
of
bourbon
malt
and
dark
fruit
flavors
its
a
big
sipper
but
still
manages
to
be
smooth
considering
its
size
a
very
nice
barleywine
to
be
sure
but
not
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
since
my
review
i
have
revisited
this
on
tap
and
in
a
bottle
i
found
that
i
like
this
best
out
of
the
bottle
or
maybe
my
local
taproom
doesnt
clean
their
lines
that
well
rating
has
been
changed
to
reflect
this
overall
this
is
a
pretty
great
beer
but
i
like
the
regular
stout
better
liked
this
better
than
the
coffee
version
much
more
complex
and
interesting
with
many
layers
of
flavor
d
a
simply
outstanding
example
of
the
style
lives
up
to
the
hype
a
wonderful
winter
sipper
seek
it
out

o
truly
a
great
example
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
a
style
that
sometimes
is
just
too
sweet
for
my
palate
to
enjoy
but
this
is
one
i
would
gladly
drink
over
and
over
again
wonderful
complexity
and
balance
to
the
flavors
o
bizarre
palate
bourbon
came
through
at
first
followed
by
malts
an
experience
comparable
to
the
first
sip
of
a
mixed
drink
then
tobacco
came
through
out
of
nowhere
prunes
and
a
woody
aroma
followed
not
something
id
drink
frequently
but
certainly
enjoyable
and
bewildering
also
much
preferred
over
goose
islands
2014
bourbon
county
coffee
stout
not
as
big
of
a
fan
as
i
am
of
the
bcbs
or
coffee
stout
but
an
excellent
beer
truly
a
complex
beverage
theres
so
much
to
enjoy
at
every
point
and
nothing
is
too
overpowering
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
its
thick
but
has
enough
carbonation
to
prevent
it
from
being
cloying
mmmmmmmmm
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
it
is
a
touch
on
the
boozy
side
but
full
of
flavor
and
hides
the
abv
well
it
is
a
bit
easier
to
drink
than
regular
bcs
and
a
worthy
member
of
the
bourbon
county
family
revisited
well
second
bottle
was
better
smoother
was
4
53
now
is
current
sticky
toffee
vanilla
bourbon
and
stone
fruit
aroma
mimics
taste
almost
to
a
t
and
i
would
consider
the
mouthfeel
to
be
perfect
very
very
very
good
but
not
my
favorite
this
is
the
2014
version
however
and
i
have
a
few
2013
to
review
i
just
wanted
to
try
it
fresh
first
according
to
style
this
is
damn
near
perfect
though
i
highly
recommend
all
bourbon
county
beers
all
a
tour
de
force
of
flavor
yielding
into
the
sublime
o
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
id
like
it
if
it
werent
quite
so
sweet
and
if
it
were
a
bit
smoother
but
its
not
so
cloying
and
boozy
as
the
bcbs
line
o
a
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
2014
my
1000th
review
words
cannot
describe
this
beer
o
a
real
treat
its
hard
to
understand
why
this
variant
always
seems
to
be
the
red
headed
stepchild
of
the
bc
lineup
perhaps
its
because
the
stouts
are
so
damn
good
as
well
all
i
know
is
that
king
henry
is
quickly
rising
up
my
list
of
musttry
beers
if
its
markedly
better
than
this
then
im
bound
to
love
it
my
bottle
from
2013
cellared
for
over
a
year
well
worth
the
wait
all
politics
of
business
aside
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
too
bad
i
will
never
pay
for
it
overalla
near
perfect
beer
extremely
delicious
drinks
dangerously
smooth
yet
is
very
warming
and
satisfying
enjoyed
a
2013
release
today
14
months
old
with
my
brothers
pours
a
dark
ruby
translucent
color
thin
film
of
head
smells
of
boozy
bourbon
with
notes
of
dark
fruits
and
malts
flavor
is
not
near
as
boozy
as
the
smell
lots
of
great
dark
fruit
notes
with
a
mild
alcohol
burn
very
conolex
flavors
definitely
a
sipper
although
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
definitely
some
unique
rich
flavors
worth
the
price
to
pick
one
up
if
you
can
get
it
i
imagine
drinking
a
fresh
one
would
be
entirely
too
boozy
for
my
palate
i
just
had
a
2013
bottle
and
i
must
say
i
did
not
care
for
this
variant
at
all
the
bourbon
flavor
over
powers
the
stout
and
it
was
too
much
epic
bourbon
molasses
caramel
fudge
sweet
but
not
cloying
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
unbelievable
aged
1
year
sorry
but
im
not
gonna
say
more
than
that
stop
analyzing
just
savor
it
had
this
at
fobab
randalled
in
coffee
it
was
amazing
total
4550
bottle
poured
a
deep
murky
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
medium
retention
and
limited
lacing
aroma
of
toffee
heavy
caramelized
malt
notes
and
some
vanilla
and
bourbon
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
loads
of
toffee
and
caramelized
notes
with
a
healthy
dose
of
residual
sugar
notes
with
some
nice
bourbon
and
vanilla
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
with
light
warming
alcohol
notes
very
well
brewed
with
nice
balanced
with
the
barrelaging
notes
maybe
a
tad
too
much
residual
sugars
overall
its
excellent
others
speak
better
than
i
do
on
this
but
i
will
add
that
this
is
like
sipping
on
commandaria
st
john
overall
this
was
really
good
surprisingly
enough
i
enjoyed
this
one
just
as
much
as
king
henry
and
i
wasnt
sure
that
would
be
the
case
to
be
sure
people
have
said
that
kh
has
fallen
off
a
cliff
but
the
bottle
we
opened
was
still
in
excellent
shape
and
we
enjoyed
it
immensely
compared
to
the
king
this
one
has
more
oak
and
toffee
in
the
flavor
while
it
is
also
smoother
and
creamier
in
the
feel
kh
in
a
bit
sharper
in
the
barrel
and
alcohol
flavors
at
this
point
and
there
is
a
hint
of
bitter
pure
chocolate
that
lends
some
nice
balance
in
any
case
this
is
a
quality
barleywine
and
i
wish
goose
island
could
somehow
produce
their
stout
with
the
same
creamy
feel
that
theyve
pulled
off
here
good
stuff
and
would
gladly
drink
more
cheers
doops
overall
this
is
an
intense
rich
complex
and
extremely
flavorful
beer
its
very
very
sweet
with
a
nice
boozy
kick
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
take
your
time
with
this
one
im
glad
i
bought
a
4
pack
of
this
when
i
saw
it
it
took
me
a
while
to
chew
through
this
but
i
savored
every
bite
the
beer
is
a
masterpiece
of
blending
diverse
aromas
and
taste
in
contrast
to
other
beers
in
the
style
it
stands
out
as
an
exceptional
brew
perhaps
i
will
find
another
bottle
to
cellar
overall
great
stuff
betting
it
will
be
even
better
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
cant
wait
to
see
o
delicious
and
super
complex
not
the
prettiest
looking
beer
but
damn
good
pours
out
murky
and
brown
with
no
head
bourbon
wood
and
vanilla
are
the
strongest
aromas
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
the
base
beer
the
bourbon
barrel
works
better
in
the
flavor
than
with
the
imperial

im
getting
a
lot
of
vanilla
and
wood
brown
sugar
from
the
barleywine
base
hints
of
roasty

from
the
stout
that
was
in

overall
another
great

brew
from

loving
the
huge
vanilla

and
dark

notes
they
are
all
separate
but
make
for
big
beer
that
has
no
business
being
this
ridiculously
tasty
a

sipper
to
celebrate
a

even
though
the

used

they
still
lent
an
immense

looking

seeing
how

wish
i
had
more

im

overall
this
beer
was
pretty
tasty
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
not
too
boozy
for
12
percent
but
theres
nothing
there
to
offset
the
cloying
sweetness
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
bourbon
county
series
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
taste
for
me
wifes
review
its
like
a
trick
it
was
sweet
at
first
and
then
way
too
strong
is
this
even
beer
this
is
the
best
barleywine
that
i
have
ever
had
amazing
balanced
when
fresh
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
it
will
be
with
a
few
years
on
it
incredible

texture
i
was
blown
away
this
is

the

its
somewhat

for

not

were
spectacular
but
for
me
this
one
took
the
cake
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
this
beer
develops
however
it
would
be
a
tough
task
considering
it
was
so
epic
at
this
stage
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
try
this
year
m
chewy
sticky
yummy
another
outstanding
brew
from
goose
island
what
it
lacks
in
appearance
it
makes
up
for
in
taste
twofold
barleywines
nowadays
seem
to
lack
that
barley
presence
in
favor
of
the
coffeechocolate
tastes
this
is
not
one
of
those
the
head
lacing
are
virtually
nonexistent
so
what
if
you
have
no
fear
of
the
dark
you
will
feel
right
at
home
here
o
cant
conceive
of
something
better
as
good
perhaps
but
this
is
sublime
o
it
is
not
a
very
traditional
barley
wine
but
damn
it
is
good
highly
recommended
o
a
real
treat
excellent
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
a
very
flavorful
barleywine
it
is
quite
sweet
and
could
use
a
touch
of
bitter
offset
unlike
the
stout
the
bourbon
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
o
delicious
beer
one
of
the
best
barleywines
out
there
2013
is
still
my
favorite
o
another
great
barleywine
and
another
great
bourbon
county
beer
i
need
to
try
hard
this
year
to
get
my
hands
on
as
many
bourbon
county
ales
as
i
can
thanks
egrace84
for
the
tasty
barleywine
prost
o
not
bad
poured
aggressively
into
a
tulip
looked
like
i
was
pouring
a
pepsi
lots
of
fizz
that
disappeared
quick
into
nothing
definitely
smell
the
bourbon
barrel
asking
with
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
so
damn
smooth
dark
chocolate
cherries
vanilla
and
a
boozy
aftertaste
not
overpowering
though
after
the
pour
thought
the
carb
would
be
too
much
but
not
the
case
very
smooth
and
tantalizes
the
palate
delicious
o
a
very
solid
easy
to
drink
barrel
aged
barleywine
i
think
another
year
or
two
on
this
and
it
will
be
even
better
not
my
favorite
at
the
moment
but
definitely
top
tier
96100
poured
into
a
wine
glass
this
is
just
amazing
pour
is
pitch
brown
low
carbonation
once
swirled
a
short
lived
head
forms
to
release
the
aroma
the
booze
is
well
hidden
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
i
smell
dark
fruit
strong
sweet
licorice
vanilla
taste
is
licorice
oak
with
a
lasting
raisin
on
the
mouth
mouthful
is
full
slightly
sticky
overall
this
beer
is
perfect
bought
3
4packs
and
am
cellaring
2
packs
cant
wait
i
also
plan
on
doing
a
side
by
side
with
other
barleywines
instantly
one
of
my
favorites
absolutely
fantastic
wish
it
were
more
available
in
my
area
though
it
was
marked
up
over
4x
from
where
i
bought
it
i
would
do
it
again
if
in
the
mood
this
is
a
musttry
this
is
a
classic
ba
beer
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
a
different
breed
of
bw
and
one
not
to
be
missed
finding
it
can
be
tough
but
the
reward
is
worth
the
search
and
the
6
price
tag
pours
blackgold
with
a
slight
head
aroma
is
amazing
rich
sweet
and
dark
taste
is
dense
with
lush
caramel
dates
etc
simply
a
fine
example
of
an
english
barleywine
the
taste
and
the
name
fit
perfectly
as
this
tastes
exactly
what
a
barleywined
bcs
would
taste
like
wish
i
had
a
barleywine
machine
to
put
a
few
beers
through
everything
about
this
beer
is
perfect
intense
vanilla
aromas
and
taste
i
really
dont
see
the
point
in
aging
this
beer
it
is
great
how
it
is
very
smooth
the
bourbon
barrel
contributes
significantly
to
the
vanilla
notes
some
slightly
floral
hops
on
the
nose
make
this
thing
even
more
complex
definitely
seek
out
and
drink
fresh
imo
overall
the
perfect
example
of
a
well
done
ba
barleywine
big
sweet
flavors
mask
the
alcohol
and
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
superb
o
an
amazing
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
ooverall
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
i
have
had
definitely
well
worth
checking
out
o
had
this
alongside
a
king
henry
and
it
held
its
own
though
kh
is
starting
to
show
its
sherrylike
oxidation
notes
so
it
may
not
be
an
entirely
fair
comparison
the
barrel
on
kh
is
certainly
more
alive
it
has
more
character
and
is
surprisingly
boozy
after
2
5
years
bcbw
is
a
bit
better
rounded
though
i
guess
thats
a
roundabout
way
of
saying
that
bcbw
is
every
ounce
the
beer
that
kh
is
gi
has
become
shockingly
good
at
this
game
and
i
hope
they
continue
to
play
in
this
sandbox
bcbw
isnt
just
one
of
the
best
releases
of
2013
its
one
of
the
best
english
bws
ever
made
if
you
missed
out
on
this
in
2013
make
sure
you
dont
sleep
on
it
this
fall
standing
ovation
o
a
great
find
that
i
hope
to
stock
up
on
and
cellar
for
the
future
better
than
bcbs
imo
10114had
it
on
tap
in
nyc
last
night
and
it
was
very
tasty
complex
and
quite
enjoyable
again
looks
were
much
nicer
on
tap
with
a
head
that
actually
stuck
around
for
a
while
leading
to
strong
boozy
complex
nose
and
rich
sweet
flavors
that
were
so
complicated
that
each
sip
was
slightly
different
the
heat
was
ever
present
again
making
for
a
real
nice
slow
sipper
o
a
very
good
very
complex
beer
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
one
i
would
love
to
sit
on
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
what
happens
a
beer
i
could
spend
an
hour
or
two
sipping
on
and
trying
to
get
to
know
very
well
done
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
it
had
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
plus
a
little
more
and
it
didnt
leave
me
disappointed
in
the
slightest
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
rich
a
little
sticky
almost
slightly
cloying
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
bottle
by
myself
with
no
problem
and
it
tastes
so
good
that
i
would
be
pretty
tempted
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
row
and
if
i
had
a
lot
i
might
do
that
i
think
it
makes
for
a
great
fall
and
winter
time
beer
it
feels
like
it
would
keep
me
warm
in
the
cold
weather
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
good
the
taste
and
aroma
were
and
the
great
mouthfeel
helped
take
this
beer
to
a
whole
new
level
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
and
i
liked
the
color
but
the
head
lacing
and
retention
were
disappointing
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
ever
saw
it
and
i
hope
it
shows
up
at
some
of
my
local
beer
stores
next
year
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
its
just
one
of
those
beers
that
you
just
have
to
try
all
in
all
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
was
also
a
little
impressed
i
was
already
expecting
this
beer
to
be
great
and
it
ended
up
exceeding
my
expectations
i
am
really
happy
i
decided
to
seek
this
beer
out
this
bourbon
county
series
has
all
been
great
this
is
now
my
favorite
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
its
that
damn
good
and
its
up
there
as
one
of
the
better
goose
island
beers
ive
had
i
still
think
i
liked
the
regular
and
the
coffee
version
slightly
more
but
that
doesnt
take
away
how
great
of
beer
this
is
and
as
it
stands
its
pretty
much
my
ideal
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
goose
island
is
really
bringing
the
heat
when
it
comes
to
these
limited
releases
awesome
job
guys
this
was
one
great
beer
keep
up
the
great
work
impressive
to
be
sure
but
in
severe
moderationch33rs
overall
very
deep
and
complex
a
wonderful
sipper
that
leaves
behind
a
lingering
warmth
drink
its
a
step
below
kh
but
you
know
on
a
random
day
id
still
crush
a
4pk
i
need
more
of
this
in
in
life
thank
you
gi
for
making
this
amazing
barleywine
here
tons
of
credit
to
this
beer
for
its
super
smooth
flavor
and
lack
of
alcohol
for
12
one
thing
that
i
find
a
bit
offputting
is
the
cocacolasoy
sauce
hints
that
come
and
go
great
fresh
whiskey
and
oak
vanilla
sweetness
atop
thick
caramel
and
raisin
this
pours
a
dark
almost
reddish
brown
with
a
head
that
recedes
quickly
the
nose
is
greeted
with
aromas
of
spice
butterscotch
vanilla
brown
sugar
subtle
chocolate
hints
of
soy
sauce
the
taste
is
sweet
with
rich
raisins
and
dark
fruit
the
palate
is
a
bit
sticky
medium
bodied
and
moderately
smooth
the
finish
is
warmed
by
the
high
abv
slightly
dry
and
pleasantly
bitter
fantastic
one
of
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
imo
alesmith
ba
old
numbskull
night
edge
this
out
but
this
is
so
wonderful
to
sip
medium
to
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
dark
fruit
with
bourbon
aftertaste
just
a
phenomenal
beer
i
feel
like
im
trashing
this
beer
by
not
giving
it
lightsout
ratings
but
its
not
a
lightsout
beer
not
like
sucaba
or
arctic
devil
or
king
henry
or
moas
biggest
flaw
is
the
imperfect
integration
of
the
base
and
the
barrel
its
good
not
great
the
nose
is
fantastic
huge
vanilla
notes
along
with
bourbon
slightly
burnt
caramel
brown
sugar
and
smoke
tastes
outrageously
good
with
the
heavy
malts
beautifully
balanced
by
the
bourbon
finish
this
is
outstanding
d
its
not
up
to
snuff
with
the
other
2013
variants
but
its
worthy
of
your
time
the
palate
isnt
hitting
quite
as
heavily
as
id
anticipated
id
be
lying
if
i
said
i
didnt
find
this
a
bit
boring
compared
to
a
staple
like
sucaba
bottle
thanks
to
tommy
pours
a
dark
muddy
brown
with
low
head
not
particularly
impressive
very
different
from
your
standard
barleywine
there
is
some
old
carameltoffee
aroma
and
candy
taste
that
is
commonly
associated
to
barleywines
but
it
ends
there
the
barrel
presence
is
very
strong
with
bourbon
and
vanilla
then
mollasses
and
anise
from
the
regular
bcs
the
final
result
reminds
me
of
american
strong
ales
or
old
ales
with
tobacco
figs
and
graham
cracker
obviously
very
sweet
along
but
also
bitter
rich
and
low
carbonation
a
decadent
american
strong
ale

o
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
a
perfect
choice
for
when
youre
craving
that
big
boozy
brew
overall
quite
good
other
than
the
overthetop
booziness
there
are
a
lot
better
beers
out
there
that
are
less
expensive
and
easier
to
get
really
good
mouthfeel
probably
the
best
part
certainly
full
bodied
with
a
strong
lingering
flavor
that
lasts
the
alcohol
has
a
nice
warming
effect
but
its
not
too
boozy
and
has
a
nice
carbonation
level
silky
smooth
with
a
nice
warming
and
slightly
bitter
finish
nice
drinkability
and
a
slow
sipper
great
beer
thanks
bbg
for
sharing
youre
the
man
and
youll
always
be
the
bbg
on
some
level
to
me
sadly
i
only
got
one
of
these
bottles
because
this
beer
is
underrated
even
though
its
in
the
top
25
i
will
definitely
need
to
get
a
few
more
bottles
and
try
to
age
them
but
i
might
not
be
able
to
keep
my
hands
off
of
them
my
only
knock
on
this
beer
is
its
ever
so
slightly
under
carbonated
overall
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
with
a
smooth
body
rich
full
flavors
and
a
nice
bourbon
warming
to
finish
o
i
love
english
barleywines
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
ive
ever
had
the
complexity
of
the
aromas
and
flavors
can
be
pondered
for
a
ling
time
over
a
12
oz
glass
another
winner
from
the
bourbon
county
series
an
outstanding
drinking
experience
the
bourbon
and
subtleyetpresent
imperial
stout
notes
fill
it
with
rich
and
flavorful
layers
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
a
barrel
aged
english
barleywine
its
still
not
a
bad
example
of
its
style
its
just
that
the
style
is
bad
the
beers
midwest
hype
and
semirareness
has
inflated
its
score
no
doubt
but
seriously
its
not
worth
whatever
youre
being
asked
to
pay
for
it
look
is
super
dark
brownreddish
hints
aroma
is
a
spectacular
barleywine
mixed
with
bourbon
and
coconut
and
sweet
candies
berries
maybe
cherry
or
blackberry
taste
is
that
of
barleywine
coconut
smoothness
and
bourbon
quite
an
incredible
combination
and
hopefully
will
be
present
next
year
as
variant
bottled
on

i
do
wish
id
have
been
able
to
taste
the
base
beer
in
this
one
without
that
im
tasting
tons
of
bourbon
barrel
effect
over
some
kind
of
barleywine
thats
not
showing
itself
what
it
is
though
is
very
tasty
its
the
perfect
beer
for
right
now
my
last
of
the
night
good
way
to
go
out
overall
if
i
had
to
fault
this
beer
it
would
be
that
it
is
a
touch
sweet
but
it
is
not
an
every
day
beer
and
it
is
a
definite
treat
this
might
be
one
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
had
o
while
the
aroma
is
way
too
heavy
on
the
raisin
maybe
some
more
age
would
mellow
that
out
the
rest
of
the
beer
checks
out
just
fine
a
complex
aggressive
yet
very
drinkable
barleywine
that
belongs
in
the
top
rankings
at
the
end
of
my
glass
i
felt
like
a
relived
my
first
moment
with
bourbon
county
stout
a
thick
succulent
big
beer
that
i
fear
cannot
get
much
better
than
it
stands
at
this
stage
only
old
ruffian
and
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
can
compete
with
this
monster
of
a
barleywine
as
a
bonus
this
becomes
my
favorite
new
beer
of
2014
amazing
o
a
great
beer
but
perhaps
not
as
balanced
and
complex
as
some
of
the
competitors
o
again
i
can
see
why
bw
lovers
wouldnt
like
this
as
much
as
they
should
i
get
it
at
the
end
of
the
day
though
take
it
for
what
it
is
a
shining
example
of
a
ba
barleywine
that
maybe
found
too
much
influence
from
the
beer
that
was
previously
housed
in
the
same
barrels
o
looks
like
a
stout
but
more
malty
than
most
excellent
dark
appearance
and
great
flavors
and
aromas
wish
i
got
more
than
5oz
overall
very
nice
more
comparable
to
mother
of
all
storms
than
sucaba
its
too
bad
that
i
dont
have
more
of
these
id
love
to
see
how
this
would
develop
over
time
and
witness
how
the
barrel
character
would
probably
shine
through
the
fruits
are
just
at
the
right
sweet
spot
at
this
point
although
id
imagine
as
they
fade
and
taste
drier
that
they
will
compliment
the
earthier
barrel
flavors
even
better
as
it
ages
nevertheless
in
terms
of
something
that
i
could
have
more
often
of
the
recent
gi
releases
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
whether
it
will
evolve
over
time
as
well
as
regular
bcbs
is
up
to
others
to
decide
but
it
melds
together
what
i
love
so
much
about
english
barleywines
and
bourbon
aged
beers
and
melds
it
intriguingly
balanced
and
wonderful
results
dont
pass
this
by
just
because
it
isnt
regular
bcbs
this
is
a
genuinely
beautiful
beer
o
this
is
a
very
sweet
almost
dessert
or
after
dinner
digestif
beer
the
small
6
oz
pour
i
had
was
a
nice
size
serving
reviewed
from
notes
taken
on
3614
i
have
one
more
bottle
ill
open
it
in
2017
and
use
it
on
my
pancakes
o
i
havent
been
in
the
craft
beer
game
very
long
1
5
years
and
i
havent
had
the
chance
to
drink
a
lot
of
bws
but
this
and
sucaba
set
the
standard
for
all
others
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
there
will
be
better
bws
made
in
the
future
that
will
rival
them
if
anything
comes
a
long
it
will
probably
only
equal
it
as
you
cant
beat
it
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
big
as
expected
and
feels
like
it
needs
to
be
handled
with
two
hands
this
beer
is
meant
to
sipped
and
not
rushed
through
there
is
some
nice
smooth
feel
to
this
beer
but
still
heavy
and
is
best
enjoyed
being
sipped
and
savored
character
is
the
best
name
for
this
beer
it
will
stay
with
you
for
some
time
and
youll
be
enjoying
it
even
after
the
beer
is
gone
overall
great
barleywine
with
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
have
a
couple
more
to
age
be
interesting
to
see
where
they
go
this
is
the
second
time
ive
sampled
this
beer
and
i
can
now
confirm
that
the
rest
of
these
bottles
are
going
deep
in
my
cellar
for
at
least
two
years
it
tastes
too
sweet
too
young
for
a
barleywine
but
it
tastes
like
potential
while
i
doubt
it
will
somehow
evolve
into
something
akin
to
king
henry
ii
i
think
my
scores
will
go
up
when
i
update
this
review
in
approximately
2018
o
quite
good
probably
not
the
very
best
its
been
a
while
since
i
had
king
henry
think
i
still
have
45
sitting
around
the
cellar
probably
time
to
open
one
up
to
compare
overall
kinda
undeniably
tasty
the
barrels
previously
containing
bourbon
county
stout
definitely
made
a
differencemake
this
unique
sweetnessbooze
is
a
little
tolling
6
oz
was
a
good
serving
size
such
a
great
brew
masks
the
abv
so
well
absolutely
delicious
definitely
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
huge
flavors
on
this
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
had
onot
sure
why
everyone
is
going
crazy
about
this
beer
maybe
the
more
subtle
bourbon
and
oak
is
attractive
to
people
o
i
was
lucky
to
find
this
hopefully
my
luck
continues
in
vegas
musthave
for
any
beer
advocate
truly
unique
and
world
class
o
overall
words
can
merely
describe
the
beautiful
rich
sweet
chocolate
burbon
beast
that
this
is
dangerously
smooth
12abv
hardly
any
indications
that
this
is
above
78
at
any
moment
so
dangerously
easy
to
drink
at
20
a
liter
this
is
worthy
its
weight
in
gold
sharply
fined
toned
extremely
polished
in
flavor
with
a
beautiful
flow
of
rich
dark
sweet
flavors
that
just
pleasure
the
tongue
into
a
state
of
ecstacy
the
craftmenship
of
the
brewing
here
is
world
class
from
start
to
finish
an
aweinsprining
drink
that
the
world
needs
more
of
overall
very
tasty
better
than
the
bourbon
county
stout
in
my
opinion
light
black
in
color
with
cloudy
complexion
just
a
trace
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
due
to
high
alcohol
i
smell
bourbonmolassesloads
of
dark
maltand
black
licorice
the
mouth
is
thick
and
yet
silky
the
flavor
is
loaded
bourbonmolasses
and
dark
malt
overall
very
nice
delicious
with
great
malts
great
dark
fruits
nice
warming
booze
that
fits
well
great
bourbon
and
barrel
great
overall
beer
but
not
quite
as
orgasmic
as
most
people
make
it
out
to
be
i
really
think
it
will
age
quite
well
though
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
in
a
couple
years
i
will
look
for
more
of
this
where
ever
i
go
overall
an
amazing
brew
to
have
from
a
growler
almost
overwhelming
in
its
complexity
in
a
good
way
o
this
goes
without
saying
but
goose
island
bourbon
county
series
is
a
cant
miss
the
barleywine
is
a
consistent
300
hitter
that
should
be
in
the
hall
of
fame
an
outstanding
beer
and
one
i
like
a
little
better
every
time
i
have
it
pours
a
bit
murky
but
clears
up
as
it
sits
very
little
head
very
nice
aromas
extremely
well
integrated
aromas
of
bourbon
with
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
slight
woody
notes
combined
with
a
subtle
nuttiness
and
a
rounded
maltiness
very
nice
the
taste
is
even
better
with
supremely
integrated
flavors
of
whiskey
and
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
and
some
light
bitterness
great
depth
and
a
long
finish
very
nice
indeed
ill
also
say
that
this
seems
to
improve
a
bit
after
at
least
a
couple
of
months
in
the
bottle
pours
a
murky
deep
deep
amber
capped
by
a
two
finger
fluffy
beige
head
excellent
retention
splotchy
lacing
here
and
there
boozy
aroma
of
vanilla
light
oak
and
rich
toffee
opens
with
dates
dried
black
cherries
and
hints
of
prune
joined
by
caramel
toffee
vanilla
finishes
with
oak
light
wisps
of
bourbon
and
general
booziness
slick
mouthfeel
with
some
creaminess
on
the
edges
lighter
side
of
fully
bodied
moderate
carbonation
more
than
expected
for
a
barrelaged
brew
an
excellent
ba
english
barleywine
but
frankly
lacks
some
depth
of
flavor
displayed
by
other
ba
english
barleywines
that
ive
rated
more
highly
o
a
great
find
that
i
hope
to
stock
up
on
and
cellar
for
the
future
bravo
goose
island
an
amazing
beer
malty
caramel
toffee
tastes
amazing
aromas
of
fruits
sweetness
just
the
right
amount
of
bourbon
flavors
and
smells
so
easy
drinking
for
a
big
beer
complex
and
balanced
this
smells
like
like
happiness
i
was
blown
away
by
the
first
sip
and
i
was
wanting
more
at
the
last
this
is
the
epitome
of
what
drinkers
of
soso
beer
are
missing
theres
nothing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
or
that
i
can
think
of
that
would
make
it
better
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
makes
craft
beer
my
passion
ed
super
thick
mouthfeel
that
just
doesnt
let
up
many
will
find
this
to
thick
or
to
sweet
but
i
find
it
to
be
lovely
truely
a
perfect
desert
beer
if
you
enjoy
port
you
will
love
this
beer
a
real
gem

a

almost

very

boozy
tons

sweet

balance
a

with

pretty
complex

is
nicely
carbonated
for
this
style
not
too
much
not
too
little
drinkability
is
fairly
high
although
the
heat
could
use
some
time
to
settle
overall
worldclass
englishstyle
barleywine
imo
drink
this
beer
at
roomtemp
i
had
it
straight
out
of
the
fridge
about
2
months
ago
and
i
got
so
much
more
aroma
and
flavor
this
time
around
o
a
great
beer
in
its
own
right
the
base
beer
is
a
delicious
example
of
a
barley
wine
english
style
im
guessing
but
i
would
have
liked
to
get
more
of
the
barrel
flavor
out
of
it
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
wouldnt
raise
hell
to
get
another
overall
another
fantastic
ba
brew
worthy
of
the
bourbon
county
name
pour
is
dark
mahogany
with
red
edges
and
a
tight
camel
head
nose
is
meaty
and
big
barrel
is
lighter
than
i
expected
with
some
cherry
sweetness
and
a
fair
bit
of
grain
depth
taste
is
very
similar
a
bit
more
wood
and
barrel
some
malt
presence
up
front
and
the
cherry
sweetness
in
back
a
fair
bit
of
heat
but
not
in
a
bad
way
and
a
full
body
with
strong
carbonation
and
a
silky
but
slightly
slick
feel
hmm
this
is
a
review
of
the
2014
it
is
a
bit
weak
in
its
maltiness
a
nice
bourbon
barrel
character
but
doesnt
really
have
the
beer
to
back
it
up
wow
really
a
disappointment
after
last
years
o
the
smell
on
this
is
definitely
amazing
all
of
the
flavors
you
would
expect
but
balanced
all
so
well
you
get
a
lot
of
the
sweetness
that
comes
with
a
fresh
bourbon
county
stout
you
get
a
lot
of
black
cherry
and
plum
flavors
i
am
not
a
big
barley
wine
fan
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
phone
fully
the
sweetness
will
fall
off
with
some
age
i
can
only
imagine
it
will
get
even
better
overall
just
a
great
beer
the
taste
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
overall
its
an
incredible
ba
barleywine
although
i
do
have
to
admit
that
i
prefer
the
regular
stout
this
one
is
much
much
sweeter
mostly
in
a
good
way
thanks
to
coirm
for
the
bottle
o
this
is
a
really
well
done
like
i
really
like
this
beer
so
glad
i
have
three
more
left
in
the
basement
probably
gonna
drink
one
more
and
age
the
other
two
i
really
wanna
see
how
this
beer
develops
great
stuff
as
awesome
as
it
was
to
find
this
beer
and
as
girly
as
it
sounds
i
am
happy
to
have
split
one
3
ways
it
was
far
to
rich
to
have
had
an
entire
12oz
myself
not
to
mention
the
buzz
and
the
mouth
taste
the
next
morning
a
worthy
adversary
but
im
still
not
certain
who
won
that
battle
if
available
you
must
try
this
o
an
amazing
beer
tastes
that
rival
most
barrel
aged
stouts
a
bit
of
a
one
note
but
what
an
amazing
note
it
is
beer
when
compared
to
some
barrel
aged
stouts
the
first
barrel
aged
barley
wine
and
one
of
the
only
regular
barley
wines
have
had
so
i
cant
compare
it
to
others
of
the
style
a
truly
great
and
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
that
is
only
slightly
hampered
by
the
heat
from
the
alcoholbarrel
worthy
of
all
the
high
praise
this
is
a
social
barleywine
with
a
great
bourbon
complexion
and
so
much
body
it
drinks
like
syrup
the
looks
are
the
only
part
that
didnt
really
turn
me
on
dark
mahogany
in
color
with
almost
no
head
and
even
a
vigorous
twirl
of
the
glass
cant
arouse
one
thick
and
dense
and
viscous
the
nose
is
very
sweet
tons
of
layers
of
grain
and
sugar
but
also
a
great
deep
char
and
vanilla
aspect
from
the
barrel
not
unnecessarily
complex
but
dynamic
to
say
the
least
i
feared
a
sugar
bomb
that
would
be
close
to
undrinkable
and
almost
immediately
wished
i
had
shared
the
bottle
but
after
the
first
sip
it
eased
up
a
bit
temperature
helped
it
unfold
and
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
was
wishing
for
more
a
toffee
style
sweetness
starts
off
a
long
flavor
journey
that
bounces
from
toasted
marshmallow
to
vanilla
extract
to
charcoal
and
rum
raisin
cake
some
spice
to
this
classic
english
ale
yeast
a
bunch
of
residual
sugar
and
not
much
hops
at
all
the
finish
is
long
and
smooth
and
while
the
alcohol
is
there
it
adds
a
layer
rather
than
distracts
more
body
than
i
thought
possible
almost
gelatinous
slippery
and
slick
but
chewy
too
mild
carbonation
is
all
it
needs
i
like
this
at
least
as
much
as
the
stout
if
not
more
its
a
world
class
beer
that
showcases
the
barrel
very
neatly
id
like
to
have
one
with
some
age
on
it
just
to
compare
vigorous
pour
into
a
large
snifter
yielded
third
of
an
inch
of
medium
tan
head
the
head
faded
within
30
seconds
to
a
thin
collar
some
remnants
of
tan
head
at
the
surface
of
the
beer
lacing
is
pretty
decent
but
not
great
aroma
is
deep
caramel
toffee
some
earthy
chocolatelike
aromas
too
taste
is
toffee
forward
some
really
woodyearthy
tones
some
bitter
chocolate
is
enjoyable
i
get
quite
a
bit
of
the
stoutlike
character
in
this
brew
less
boozey
than
i
remember
from
the
first
time
i
had
it
full
thick
body
and
medium
carbonation
aging
is
for
analysts
anyway
hype
hell
yeah
worth
it
hell
yeah
overall
ive
raved
enough
this
is
a
masterpiece
beer
as
well
thought
out
as
it
is
executed
if
you
like
english
barleywines
or
barrel
aged
beer
get
your
hands
on
some
of
this
the
stoutish
twist
is
great
but
its
only
a
1
element
in
a
beer
with
uncountably
many
virtues
deep
brown
sort
of
a
caramel
colour
with
a
thin
cap
that
settled
quickly
to
a
modest
collar
and
wisps
of
fine
bubbles
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
sweet
malty
aroma
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
balanced
by
barrel
character
woody
and
slightly
boozy
not
quite
cheesy
pretty
nice
overall
sweetness
wood
and
booze
fight
it
out
in
the
flavour
too
but
now
theres
a
solid
bitterness
that
plays
counterpoint
throughout
sugary
sweetness
bitterness
midpalate
alcohol
warmth
woody
astringency
toffee
low
carbonation
full
fairly
heavy
body
theres
a
lot
of
character
here
from
the
barrel
aging
booze
and
tannins
mostly
balanced
nicely
by
a
solid
barleywine
definitely
worth
trying
more
than
once
bourbon
county
brand
barleywine
pours
a
dark
brownish
color
with
a
swirling
small
head
there
is
a
strong
oaky
and
earthy
aroma
with
a
sharp
malt
bite
the
taste
is
similar
good
sharp
malt
backbone
with
bold
oaky
flavors
very
drinkable
and
bold
great
flavors
and
very
drinkable
overall
wow
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
though
a
bit
too
sweet
when
first
bottled
let
it
settle
for
a
year
or
so
and
it
will
mature
nicely
o
big
smell
flavors
and
feel
definitely
a
treat
for
the
senses
although
i
could
do
with
a
bit
less
residual
sweetness
o
one
more
time
wow
this
beer
is
phenomenal
although
i
want
to
drink
the
remaining
three
bottles
i
plan
to
age
them
for
a
few
months
first
as
i
expect
it
to
become
even
better
over
time
highly
recommended
update
7514
with
9
months
of
age
the
balance
is
even
sweeter
than
i
remember
reducing
the
taste
score
to
account
for
cloying
sweetness
as
well
as
some
soy
sauce
oxidation
notes
poured
on
tap
into
a
snifter
pours
reddish
black
with
little
head
but
not
that
surprising
smells
of
raisins
and
a
little
of
red
wine
pretty
much
perfect
beer
tastes
of
raisins
and
almost
a
licorice
very
nice
balance
beer
is
full
bodied
but
has
very
little
harshness
goes
down
really
nice
this
beer
lives
up
to
its
billing
a
superb
beer
had
ontap
at
maxs
taphouse
in
baltimore
having
never
had
king
henry
id
be
hardpressed
to
find
a
better
barleywine
in
general
so
sick
so
good
i
found
another
great
beer
raising
my
glass
to
you
ba
nitpicking
i
found
some
traits
that
keeps
this
from
being
the
best
one
ive
tasted
but
as
near
to
perfection
as
a
bw
can
be
out
of
the
gate
staggeringly
good
o
fantastic
no
doubt
about
it
up
there
with
my
favorite
barleywines
of
all
time
its
my
highest
rated
but
my
other
top
ones
i
rated
before
the
0
25
increment
rating
scales
so
its
not
fair
to
compare
that
way
a
must
try
for
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
the
style
overall
bcbbw
is
a
really
fantastic
barrelaged
barleywine
and
really
blew
my
expectations
out
of
the
water
i
was
planning
on
trying
to
score
some
more
kh
in
the
near
future
but
after
this
bottle
i
think
i
will
just
get
a
case
of
this
stuff
o
i
love
this
beer
and
im
both
happy
and
relieved
that
i
got
some
so
this
barleywine
has
some
pronounced
stout
characteristics
which
makes
me
wonder
to
what
extent
this
is
thanks
to
the
bcbs
previously
in
these
barrels
and
how
much
is
thanks
to
the
base
barleywines
recipie
it
would
be
inteteresting
to
know
how
stouty
this
was
before
the
barrel
how
significant
could
bcbss
flavor
contribution
be
after
a
relatively
short
time
in
the
barrel
no
matter
the
beer
is
stellar
not
as
characterful
as
the
rest
but
delicious
cant
wait
to
see
some
age
on
this
pours
a
turbid
dark
brown
zero
head
zero
lacing
leggy
but
no
stained
glass
left
behind
meh
smell

2013
overall
a
brilliant
barley
wine
fresh
very
smooth
the
smell
came
out
even
while
i
drank
it
and
added
to
the
experience
i
hope
i
can
hands
on
a
few
bottles
of
this
and
see
how
it
ages
o
extremely
enjoyable
brew
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
o
i
hate
to
love
this
beer
but
i
do
indeed
love
it
on
a
side
note
i
basically
reviewed
this
as
a
stout
and
not
a
barleywine
im
not
sure
why
they
throw
barleywine
into
the
title
when
clearly
this
is
not
a
representation
of
a
barleywine
whatsoever
as
a
beer
in
general
this
is
out
of
this
fucking
world
as
for
a
barleywine
why
call
it
that
its
like
trying
to
say
a
womans
anus
is
different
from
a
mans
no
its
not
overall
this
brew
is
king
henry
reborn
for
those
of
you
who
have
never
had
it
this
is
by
far
the
closest
thing
you
will
find
that
bears
a
resemblence
an
absolute
gem
and
to
downgrade
it
is
an
absolute
insult
grab
a
glass
and
do
not
share
salud
o
balanced
with
malt
and
dark
fruit
barley
wine
beers
are
far
from
my
favorite
though
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
barleys
i
have
had
because
of
this
i
could
not
give
this
a
higher
rating
cheers
o
i
admit
my
bias
since
barleywines
are
not
my
go
to
style
but
this
was
very
pleasant
and
completely
enjoyable
considering
putting
into
the
cellar
and
see
how
this
develops
with
some
age
o
im
not
even
a
huge
barleywine
fan
but
more
beers
like
this
would
change
that
certainly
not
something
youd
drink
multiples
of
in
a
sitting
but
when
you
feel
like
splurging
and
have
a
designated
driver
or
are
on
your
own
couch
you
cant
go
wrong
here
wonderful
beer
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
taste
everything
about
this
guy
is
just
so
so
rich
and
complex
with
layers
upon
layers
upon
layers
as
you
would
expect
from
the
bc
brand
the
first
big
noticeable
difference
stylistically
is
how
damn
dark
it
is
its
like
black
barleywine
status
a
la
the
sierra
nevada
black
barleywine
from
a
few
years
back
while
each
sip
begins
and
peaks
with
bright
sweetness
much
like
the
standard
bourbon
county
stout
it
is
through
the
end
and
aftertaste
of
the
sip
where
this
beer
really
begins
to
take
its
own
unique
form
the
malts
sweeten
up
with
warmth
helping
to
create
some
cracks
in
the
darkness
of
themselves
allowing
for
the
fruit
and
inherent
bitterness
of
booze
and
wood
to
shine
through
this
is
where
the
true
complexity
of
the
beer
lies
once
it
all
begins
to
fall
into
place
the
aroma
while
intensely
rich
roasty
and
robust
and
hinting
at
the
darkness
of
the
beer
doesnt
quite
come
to
that
same
level
of
glory
as
the
flavoring
again
this
is
just
a
treat
all
around
and
although
it
isnt
quite
as
sticky
dank
and
forever
as
king
henry
we
are
extremely
happy
to
have
been
able
to
track
down
and
consume
this
beer
especially
since
we
thought
it
was
gone
forever
2013
vintage
im
looking
forward
to
aging
the
rest
hello
barleywine
you
can
spend
the
night
and
raul
wont
care
overall
a
nice
sweeter
slow
sipping
barleywine
with
plenty
of
nice
bourbon
and
oaky
flavors
this
is
one
to
sit
down
with
on
a
cold
evening
night
in
front
of
a
fire
slowly
sip
away
while
reading
the
paper
or
a
nice
book
very
barrel
forward
with
strong
presence
of
bourbon
still
has
reasonable
balance
with
malt
aspect
of
the
barleywine
base
detectable
hops
presence
offer
contrast
to
other
flavours
not
sure
if
truly
lives
up
to
hype
but
still
enjoyable
offering
i
imagine
some
age
in
the
bottle
version
would
improve
the
overall
experience
an
aggressive
pour
into
my
darkness
tulip
this
ruby
fig
purple
brown
barleywine
has
a
brown
sugar
foam
head
that
fades
quickly
and
slides
away
into
the
abyss
not
a
hint
of
carbonation
which
is
how
i
like
my
bba
english
bws
insane
sticky
and
drippy
legs
as
it
swirls
around
the
glass
dried
figs
raisins
vanilla
beans
bourbon
caramel
covered
cherries
mulled
winter
spices
and
honey
picking
up
lovely
stout
notes
and
hints
of
banana
deep
dark
naughty
fruit
uplifting
vanilla
and
honey
sweetness
sweet
bourbon
charred
malt
and
a
hint
of

tastes
of
cherries
figs
and
vanilla
beans
dredged
in
caramel
covered
semisweet
chocolate
subtle
notes
of
tangy
citrus
peel
oak
cocoa
coffee
and
even
more
dried
fruit
the
bourbon
pokes
in
and
out
between
each
sip
and
the
finish
sticky
honey
sweet
it
runs
down
and
coats
your
throat
with
each
sip
so
thick
and
delicious
gi
has
definately
perfected
the
english
barleywine
its
may
not
be
kh
but
its
one
hell
of
an
attempt
damn
near
perfection
overall
solid
brew
but
honestly
it
left
me
wanting
regular
bcbs
or
one
of
the
stout
variants
one
of
my
least
favorite
variants
yet
still
good
enough
to
warrant
a
solid
45
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
an
inch
of
foamy
tan
head
that
sticks
around
through
drinking
in
the
form
of
a
thin
halo
settling
neatly
around
the
perimeter
im
impressed
by
the
depth
of
color
head
retention
and
nearoily
lacing
the
nose
is
a
prominent
boozy
brown
sugarcaramel
vanilla
bourbon
woodiness
the
taste
brings
the
same
notesflavors
full
force
moving
towards
a
nice
balance
between
sugary
sweetness
and
booze
as
it
warms
i
notice
a
bit
of
pruney
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
in
the
taste
compared
to
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
big
full
bodied
as
expected
with
a
great
sweetness
tamed
only
by
the
biting
booze
and
the
slightly
tannic
bitterness
id
say
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
which
is
profound
considering
how
i
generally
feel
about
the
style
and
the
steep
oz
ratio
however
ill
probably
pass
on
it
in
the
future
o
the
beer
is
a
solid
offering
but
nowhere
near
a
home
run
the
third
use
barrels
dont
quite
give
it
the
hotness
or
booziness
fans
of
big
bourbon
barrel
barley
wines
will
be
used
to
while
this
isnt
by
any
means
a
deal
breaker
it
does
introduce
an
interesting
flavor
profile
that
is
satisfying
d
this
was
simply
delicious
the
scent
and
taste
were
complex
but
well
integrated
the
body
was
fantastic
and
the
alcohol
was
hidden
amazingly
well
it
had
a
crazy
smooth
finish
too
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
even
though
it
must
be
sipped
would
age
forever
but
doesnt
need
it
meets
the
hype
as
a
top
notch
brew
o
4

sometimes
a
barleywine
starts
off
fine
but
then
hangs
a
turn
in
my
mouth
and
goes
somewhere
i
dont
want
either
flat
and
dead
or
too
sherry
or
bitter
in
an
unpleasant
way
this
one
doesnt
it
stays
on
track
theres
some
activity
and
it
gets
right
to
the
edge
of
where
it
would
veer
off
but
it
keeps
on
track
thats
very
nice
and
welcome
and
tantalizing
at
the
same
time
its
hard
to
even
really
compare
this
with
other
barleywines
because
it
seems
like
such
a
different
animal
i
like
it
much
better
the
beer
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
with
a
fluffy
offwhitenearly
tan
head
of
large
sodalike
bubbles
the
head
is
surprisingly
large
but
quickly
fizzles
away
to
a
nice
fat
scrim
that
is
continuously
fed
by
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
in
the
glass
the
beer
looks
pretty
much
like
a
stout
or
imperial
porter
the
light
reddish
hue
is
the
only
thing
that
really
sets
it
apart
in
body
the
beer
is
a
very
deep
clear
ruby
that
is
a
few
touches
away
from
being
opaque
on
the
nose
the
beer
is
rich
and
decadent
spicy
bourbon
rich
oak
tannin
vanilla
coconut
and
then
thick
fudge
molasses
bread
plum
pudding
and
toffee
play
across
the
nose
the
barrel
is
strong
but
not
the
overriding
character
in
the
nose
which
i
quite
like
with
a
bit
of
age
the
nose
of
this
beer
alone
could
really
develop
into
something
quite
amazing
as
is
the
nose
is
intriguing
boozy
and
rich
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
decadently
sweet
with
a
touch
of
acidity
that
gives
a
pop
the
finish
is
rich
alcohol
that
becomes
only
a
touch
hot
and
solventlike
in
closing
but
does
dry
out
very
soft
bitterness
from
both
tannins
and
herbal
hops
can
be
felt
in
the
middle
and
finish
of
the
sip
some
of
the
sweetness
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
spicy
wood
blooming
into
rich
bourbon
soaked
molasses
bread
brown
sugar
fudge
with
bits
of
toffee
in
it
and
plum
pudding
touches
of
dry
raisins
float
across
the
palate
and
the
bourbon
flavors
definitely
suggest
soft
vanilla
as
well
the
finish
bring
rich
dark
fruits
a
touch
of
banana
and
fudge
beside
spicy
alcohol
and
just
a
touch
of
solvent
the
beer
is
decadent
boozy
and
delicious
i
wish
there
was
a
little
less
booze
but
i
think
age
would
definitely
help
with
that
problem
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
full
and
oozingly
smooth
little
to
no
carbonation
can
be
sensed
and
the
mouth
is
left
tingly
with
booze
but
still
wet
in
the
cheeks
though
the
tongue
feels
a
bit
dry
overall
i
am
quite
surprised
by
this
beer
i
like
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywines
but
they
arent
really
my
favorite
thing
this
one
however
is
rich
and
full
of
malt
character
that
i
really
enjoy
the
bourbon
flavors
are
light
and
perfectly
complement
the
other
flavors
with
a
little
more
age
this
beer
will
be
delicious
this
beer
is
worthy
of
a
try
for
sure
i
have
1
bottle
left
and
will
try
it
again
soon
and
update
this
post
i
can
not
compare
it
to
king
henry
since
i
never
had
it
delicious
just
a
great
ba
barleywine
not
as
good
as
sucaba
or
moas
imo
but
damn
good
overall
this
is
an
amazing
tasting
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
i
could
drink
it
all
night
sweet
and
malty
with
almost
no
bitterness
a
bit
of
a
sourness
to
the
taste
and
more
so
to
the
smell
but
great
great
beer
overall
o
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
in
every
facet
i
had
bourbon
county
coffee
stout
a
few
nights
ago
and
i
enjoy
this
one
a
lot
more
incredibly
complex
and
while
sweet
provides
so
many
wonderful
nuances
with
the
barrel
character
that
prevents
it
from
crossing
over
into
oversweet
fantastic
beer
and
worth
effort
to
obtain
really
impressed
with
this
brew
and
wonder
how
or
if
age
will
change
its
almost
flawless
composition
this
brew
will
convert
the
uninitiated
to
barleywines
cheers
o
i
am
a
big
fan
of
english
barleywines
most
of
them
i
like
to
age
for
a
few
years
before
i
drink
them
but
this
gi
barleywine
is
certainly
very
enjoyable
right
out
of
the
gate
still
it
is
a
tad
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
see
what
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
will
do
for
these
i
will
come
back
to
amend
this
review
in
one
year
mf
syrupy
smooth
slick
full
bodied
3
75
overall
really
interesting
and
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
love
it
overall
wow
just
wow
this
is
the
best
barrelaged
barleywine
i
tasted
i
was
unsure
about
this
until
i
actually
tasted
this
for
the
first
time
hrmm
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
at
5
9912oz
not
something
i
would
feel
compelled
to
buy
again
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
sam
adams
triple
bock
one
bottle
is
enough
to
last
a
while
if
you
like
this
beer
try
jewbelation
which
is
at
a
better
price
point
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
brown
color
almost
black
rich
toffee
caramel
vanilla
flavors
throughout
all
wrapped
in
a
velvety
bourbon
county
envelope
this
is
really
a
fantastic
beer
im
not
a
huge
barleywine
fan
but
this
is
incredible
slight
booze
in
the
finish
warms
as
it
goes
down
the
ale
is
alive
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
savory
sweet
notes
appealing
to
all
that
is
sweet
earthy
boozy
and
salty
all
at
once
beers
like
this
might
as
well
be
like
catnip
to
a
savory
fiend
like
me
i
am
so
glad
i
picked
this
up
when
it
was
available
i
paid
22
for
a
four
pack
but
when
you
compare
this
beer
to
those
bombers
selling
for
1520
each
this
is
a
steal
dont
pass
it
up
if
you
see
it
oan
outstanding
and
complex
barleywine
enjoyable
sipping
and
savoring
should
do
well
with
a
little
aging
overall
an
outstanding
barleywine
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
ages
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
a
slow
sipper
with
rich
and
complex
flavor
outstanding
poured
a
dark
mahogany
with
minimal
head
into
a
snifter
it
smells
of
dates
raisins
vanilla
coconut
molasses
and
bourbon
with
the
taste
matches
the
smell
it
has
that
almost
sour
bite
that
you
experience
as
an
aftertaste
with
a
lot
of
bourbons
wow
this
is
a
big
beer
and
a
true
sipper
pours
a
hazy
deep
tawny
brown
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
shows
little
retention
sweet
bourbon
with
a
soft
woodsy
aroma
atop
the
caramel
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
contained
within
light
plum
and
cherry
fruits
with
a
hint
of
earth
and
ethanol
round
out
the
nose
the
flavor
is
brown
sugar
toffee
and
caramel
maltiness
upfront
before
the
sweet
bourbon
and
a
twinge
of
ethanol
remind
you
this
is
one
serious
brew
light
vanilla
and
hints
of
pitted
fruits
round
out
the
flavor
nicely
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
a
really
nice
barleywine
right
there
d
hands
down
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
i
have
had
to
date
rich
and
incredibly
complex
with
the
bourbon
notes
incorporated
so
nicely
loads
of
toffee
vanilla
and
dark
berry
stoked
to
have
tried
this
closest
i
will
probably
ever
get
to
king
henry
overall
this
is
an
incredible
beer
i
am
glad
i
have
three
more
to
see
what
some
age
does
to
them
though
it
is
going
to
be
hard
to
resist
i
actually
prefer
this
to
bcbs
which
says
a
lot
o
king
jr
here
is
very
nice
thick
and
chewy
with
amazing
flavors
good
job
12302014
updated
the
taste
rating
as
i
sampled
a
bottle
i
aged
for
1
year
the
bourbon
character
is
absolutely
fantastic
with
some
aging
the
sweetness
falls
back
just
enough
to
let
the
barrel
through
i
enjoyed
a
few
of
these
bottles
over
the
holiday
break
at
duckworths
ballantyne
this
is
a
very
large
and
rich
bw
that
lands
very
heavy
on
the
barrel
side
and
finishes
stickysweet
the
finish
was
actually
very
similar
to
the
coffee
varietal
just
entirely
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
there
arent
many
other
bad
things
to
say
about
this
beer
smooth
and
a
pretty
optimal
booziness
rich
caramel
malt
sticky
caramelized
brown
sugar
very
good
stuff
but
my
first
reaction
was
that
there
are
plenty
of
peers
in
this
class
with
central
waters
bbbw
remaining
the
breadwinner
in
my
opinion
and
at
half
the
price
i
love
bourbon
county
stout
so
i
was
really
excited
for
this
beer
i
poured
the
beer
do
find
a
dark
brown
beer
with
little
head
that
faded
quickly
the
beer
was
slightly
hazy
as
well
the
aroma
was
subtle
malty
some
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
nothing
spectacular
or
out
of
the
ordinary
for
a
barrel
aged
beer
so
far
this
beer
tasted
plain
it
was
syrupy
and
strong
but
really
lacked
complexity
over
all
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
a
disappointing
beer
i
am
not
sure
if
i
had
to
high
of
expectations
or
if
it
really
is
just
meh
but
i
can
say
there
are
several
much
better
barrel
aged
beers
out
there
notes
the
closest
i
have
been
to
beer
perfection
had
this
again
on
2714
from
tap
at
roast
house
pub
in
frederick
md
after
visiting
flying
dog
brewery
for
ba
gonzo
release
and
i
do
hereby
reaffirm
all
dat
shit
i
said
herein
above
bcbbw
is
da
bomb
overall
it
is
very
intriguing
not
nearly
the
bourbon
barrel
character
of
bcbs
but
i
think
i
get
equal
amounts
of
the
barrel
and
base
beer
of
bcbs
in
this
one
i
also
noticed
the
alcohol
in
this
one
seems
smoother
at
first
but
lingers
longer
than
bcbs
barleywines
arent
my
favorite
but
i
dont
see
how
this
could
be
a
better
one
the
lingering
sweetness
truly
makes
it
as
it
works
so
well
a
positively
outstanding
example
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
english
styled
barleywine
goose
island
using
previously
used
bourbon
county
brand
stout
barrels
was
a
fabulous
idea
because
this
barleywine
really
picked
up
on
some
of
the
rich
chocolatey
and
coffee
notes
of
the
stout
i
dont
think
ive
as
of
yet
had
a
barleywine
with
such
a
creamy
mouthfeel
highly
highly
recommended
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
maroon
color
with
minimal
headlacing
the
smell
is
sweet
with
toffee
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
even
sweeter
with
strong
caramel
vanilla
prunes
and
oak
the
sweetness
is
perfectly
balanced
by
the
bourbon
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
much
smoother
and
lighter
than
id
expect
from
the
style
and
the
abv
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
thought
it
was
a
great
execution
of
the
style
o
very
good
ba
barleywine
a
bit
of
a
slow
sipper
but
not
at
all
overbearing
alcohol
although
definitely
noticeable
does
not
overpower
bourbon
barrel
definitely
enhances
the
beer
without
the
bite
of
the
bourbon
this
might
come
across
as
too
sweet
and
sugary
still
this
is
very
smooth
and
a
great
after
dinnerdessert
beer
sometimes
i
feel
price
dictates
ratings
in
this
case
it
kinda
does
its
a
pricey
hyped
12oz
bottle
while
it
is
good
there
is
no
doubting
that
i
feel
people
may
rate
this
higher
cuse
of
the
cost
or
lack
of
tasting
other
barleywines
edit
with
a
year
on
it
the
taste
is
so
epic
smooth
and
delicious
o
this
beer
is
outstanding
i
prefer
this
slightly
over
the
bourbon
county
brand
stout
a
must
try
for
anyone
overall
another
out
of
the
park
homerun
from
chicago
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
of
all
time
and
barleywines
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
overall
this
beer
has
it
all
smell
and
taste
that
is
unmatched
loads
of
boozy
goodness
and
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
beer
if
you
can
find
this
buy
it
aroma
of
bourbon
vanilla
brown
sugar
malt
toasted
marshmallows
taste
bourbon
vanilla
wood
faint
tobacco
toffee
sherry
sublime
m
full
bodied
big
beer
but
relatively
drinkable
tastes
so
good
i
cant
stop
moderate
carbonation
o
enjoyed
this
on
tap
and
now
bottled
best
barrel
aged
barleywine
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
much
respect
to
insanity
and
central
waters
but
this
is
a
notch
better
seek
this
one
out
cheers
overall
terrific
this
is
100
a
barleywine
and
not
just
a
stout
with
added
dark
fruits
its
terrific
picked
this
up
in
a
great
trade
with
mike
and
evan
dark
mahogany
pour
with
a
beige
one
finger
head
that
quickly
fades
but
with
really
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
heavenly
for
a
barleywine
lover
like
myself
lots
of
dark
fruits
bourbon
and
oak
along
with
hints
of
figs
toffee
raisins
and
sweet
brown
bread
the
taste
is
just
as
amazing
and
mirrors
the
nose
oak
dark
fruits
vanilla
molasses
black
cherries
maple
toffee
with
some
subtle
chocolate
and
licorice
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
and
velvety
smooth
with
a
nice
subtle
warming
finish
its
amazingly
not
hot
or
boozy
for
a
12
abv
beer
but
im
still
going
to
cellar
a
couple
of
these
and
see
what
happens
overall
this
may
not
be
quite
in
the
same
league
as
king
henry
but
its
pretty
damn
close
and
way
more
available
another
classic
offering
from
goose
island
o
outstanding
on
draft
compared
to
the
bottle
this
is
night
and
day
an
a
barleywine
if
any
bars
advertise
having
this
on
draft
absolutely
check
it
out
o
well
if
youre
looking
for
a
topoftheline
barrelaged
english
barleywine
this
pretty
much
stands
at
the
top
along
with
sucaba
thick
heavy
viscous
and
super
sweet
bourbon
cuts
it
just
enough
to
help
the
drinkability
but
doesnt
overpower
the
great
maltiness
drink
this
one
warm
this
beer
was
really
good
if
not
great
i
will
certainly
buy
it
again
if
goose
island
makes
it
again
it
just
fell
short
of
the
high
expectations
they
have
set
from
their
other
bourbon
county
offerings
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
special
rendition
of
a
barleywine
and
one
that
i
believe
would
benefit
from
some
aging
luckily
i
have
a
second
bottle
to
sit
on
for
awhile
this
might
be
a
perfect
example
of
the
barleywine
style
overall
i
love
it
i
think
goose
island
has
done
quite
a
good
job
with
their
bourbon
barrel
aging
i
like
the
vanilla
and
caramel
flavors
that
come
out
of
the
barrel
but
i
dont
like
straight
bourbon
flavors
this
brew
is
a
great
example
of
that
overall
a
very
excellent
and
well
balance
barrelaged
barley
wine
it
doesnt
reinvent
the
wheel
but
it
delivers
what
it
promises
definitely
one
to
sit
with
over
the
course
of
the
weekend

aftertaste
overall
its

and
im
typically
not
a

of
overly
sweet
beers
but
this
one
brings
enough
rich
complexity
to
keep
things
very
interesting
alcohol
is
barely
perceived
and
when
it
is
its
a
nice
cool
flavor
element
absolutely
delicious
this
beer
has
awesome
potential
the
bourbon
might
be
a
little
overpowering
right
now
but
im
glad
i
have
some
to
put
away
overall
outstanding
bourbon
character
perfectly
complements
this
barleywine
beautiful
complex
amazingly
smooth
the
flavor
is
outstanding
such
depth
smokiness
and
bourbon
barrel
goodness
is
this
for
real
right
now
poured
a
beautiful
burgundy
color
the
smells
of
bcbs
hit
first
followed
by
dates
figs
vanilla
soft
oak
brown
sugar
and
molasses
waft
through
the
glass
first
sip
is
a
carnival
of
flavors
so
many
crazy
things
going
on
yet
somehow
all
seemingly
in
place
and
doing
exactly
what
they
should
the
initial
sip
introduces
the
slightest
hint
of
the
bourbon
county
stout
followed
by
an
sweetness
of
dried
fruits
and
toffee
continuing
down
the
road
as
the
beer
warmed
up
i
found
the
oak
and
vanilla
to
come
forward
with
some
fig
preserves
and
brown
sugar
coming
through
as
well
for
the
price
of
5
bucks
for
a
12
ouncer
i
can
say
id
buy
a
case
of
it
easy
13
is
well
hidden
so
well
in
fact
that
i
didnt
detect
any
alcohol
this
is
certainly
a
sweet
rich
beer
and
im
excited
to
see
what
a
few
years
of
age
will
do
o
an
awesome
addition
to
the
line
up
a
very
similar
taste
to
the
regular
stout
from
the
barrels
and
the
barley
wine
base
is
a
great
one
to
build
off
of
i
am
not
a
fan
of
barleywines
rarely
like
what
i
try
even
those
well
regarded
i
do
like
this
quite
a
bit
as
the
characteristics
i
tend
to
hate
about
bws
arent
present
overly
sweet
caramel
butterscotch
abundance
of
hops
i
could
drink
this
on
occasion
and
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
overall
the
best
barleywine
i
have
ever
tried
quite
delicious
but
to
me
also
seems
really
similar
to
a
quality
quad
at
least
right
now
in
the
early
going
note
this
does
significantly
improve
with
time
about
4
25
rating
after
812
months
aging
i
was
prepared
to
be
let
down
now
im
all
grinny
not
a
chink
in
its
armor
this
is
a
masterpiece
if
id
have
known
id
have
been
hunting
this
one
down
with
an
elephant
gun
wow
off
to
enjoy
i
am
a
big
fan
of
bourbonbarrelaged
english
barleywines
in
fact
i
might
even
like
them
more
than
bourbonbarrelaged
imperial
stouts
the
combination
of
sweet
toffeelike
malt
and
rich
bourbon
is
hard
to
beat
unfortunately
very
few
breweries
that
i
have
access
to
produce
them
so
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
them
the
bottom
line
is
that
they
do
not
compare
to
this
one
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
you
think
to
yourself
i
wish
michael
jackson
the
beer
hunter
could
have
tried
this
what
would
he
think
of
it
i
think
i
know
what
hed
say
that
this
is
simply
a
masterpiece
of
the
brewers
art
o
while
i
love
every
beer
ive
had
in
the
bcbs
line
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
that
being
said
i
guessed
this
would
be
the
case
just
due
to
the
nature
of
barleywines
delicious
yet
im
comparing
it
to
the
original
t
heavy
sticky
caramel
right
off
the
bat
milk
chocolate
burnt
raisin
charred
wood
toasted
coconut
finish
of
bourbon
burnt
brown
sugar
and
oak
a
very
good
barleywine
but
i
dont
think
its
in
the
same
class
as
sucaba
or
mother
of
all
storms
pours
a
clear
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
bourbon
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
vanilla
caramel
brown
sugar
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
bourbon
presence
even
though
the
barrels
were
third
use
for
the
barrel
aging
process
an
excellent
barleywine
that
is
intensely
and
syrupy
sweet
not
for
everybody
but
for
those
who
like
thick
barleywines
as
meals
youll
love
it
o
a
very
good
variant
by
goose
island
very
complex
perfect
sipping
beer
for
the
winter
months
i
wish
had
a
case
more
of
this
stuff
o
a
great
entry
into
the
bc
family
doesnt
present
the
barrel
as
much
as
the
other
variants
but
remains
a
pinnacle
of
the
style
and
supremely
drinkable
over
a
nice
drawn
out
period
as
with
most
of
the
series
drinking
it
over
time
really
is
the
way
to
enjoy
its
complexities
as
the
glass
warms
i
think
my
personal
tastes
still
prefer
the
stout
but
this
is
equal
in
terms
of
execution
o
i
may
be
in
the
minority
here
but
this
was
just
too
much
for
me
as
with
everything
in
the
bourbon
county
series
this
beer
has
a
massive
malt
body
however
there
is
no
attempt
at
balance
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
allowed
to
run
amok
it
builds
to
near
sickly
cloying
levels
at
times
it
feels
as
though
im
drinking
straight
molasses
even
a
bourbon
barrel
is
no
match
and
it
slowly
drowns
in
all
the
sweetness
i
was
ready
to
be
done
halfway
through
the
bottle
not
worth
the
hype
or
the
price
tag
at
all
m
smooth
bit
if
heat
as
it
warms
notably
thinner
than
bcbs
overall
a
near
flawless
representation
of
a
bba
english
barley
wine
cant
wait
to
open
the
rest
a
few
years
down
the
road
heres
to
hoping
this
becomes
a
regular
in
the
bcb
line
up
o
an
amazing
barrel
aged
barleywine
hopefully
it
wont
ruin
others
that
i
try
low
b
o
fantastic
and
even
better
than
anticipated
not
quite
as
good
as
the
coffee
was
to
me
but
damn
close
amazing
how
smooth
it
is
fresh
overall
this
is
a
stellar
beer
thrilled
to
have
6
bottles
down
in
my
cellar
aka
the
16
sealed
cardboard
boxes
in
the
unfinished
section
of
my
basement
because
this
will
be
an
absolute
treasure
in
a
year
or
two
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
of
24sep13
pours
a
murky
dark
brownish
color
with
no
head
the
aroma
is
a
big
whiff
of
bourbon
with
some
dark
fruits
earth
dark
cherries
and
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
bourbon
upfront
that
mellows
a
bit
and
gives
way
to
the
dark
cherries
and
earth
plums
raisins
and
malts
almost
has
a
faint
cola
taste
in
the
background
maybe
even
cherry
coke
warming
alcohol
with
earth
and
dark
cherries
at
the
end
this
one
wasnt
as
boozey
as
i
expected
it
to
be
but
there
is
certainly
a
big
alcohol
presence
slick
but
heavy
mouthfeel
when
i
heard
there
was
going
to
be
a
bourbon
county
barleywine
i
was
pumped
it
did
not
disappoint
overall
amazing
overall
this
is
a
terrifically
complex
beer
really
a
hybrid
beer
here
with
all
of
the
stout
characteristics
a
very
interesting
and
well
done
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
ill
be
enjoying
this
again
soon
for
sure
those
calling
this
too
sweet
are
stuck
thinking
american
is
the
only
barleywine
type
this
is
as
it
should
be
overall
gi
always
impresses
with
these
brews
the
bcbs
series
is
popular
for
a
reason
this
iteration
is
delicious
flavors
are
so
well
crafted
and
work
so
well
together
in
a
seamless
concoction
of
delicious
sweet
rich
caramel
and
dark
fruit
notes
slow
cap
this
is
seriously
complex
whew
i
knew
it
wood
be
good
har
har
but
the
rich
toffee
flavor
with
some
vanilla
notes
of
the
barrel
combine
to
bring
a
really
delicious
full
flavor
which
leads
to
a
tangy
yeast
fruitiness
again
bringing
a
figlike
richness
to
mind
with
a
toasted
oak
goodness
rounding
out
the
taste
with
slight
cocoa
with
gentle
nutty
creaminess
toward
the
end
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
taste
but
nowhere
near
12
it
is
hidden
very
well
and
halfway
in
it
is
not
showing
any
heat
or
bourbon
taste
yet
the
barrel
influence
is
apparent
overall
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
except
the
stout
that
previously
resided
in
the
barrels
may
have
added
to
the
flavor
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
considers
themselves
a
fan
of
the
style
i
only
wish
i
had
purchased
more
kudos
on
a
phenomenal
beer
that
exceeded
my
expectations
goose
island
overall
this
is
great
and
i
am
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
o
very
impressed
goose
island
does
no
wrong
in
my
eyes
when
it
comes
to
their
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
i
never
tried
king
henry
so
cannot
compare
to
that
one
i
love
this
beer
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
to
age
and
compare
later
on
overall
im
just
blown
away
by
this
beer
ive
had
the
standard
bcbs
before
but
never
any
of
the
variants
the
thirduse
bourbon
barrels
impart
some
characteristics
of
the
stout
and
really
bring
a
fascinating
and
wonderful
dimension
to
this
beer
its
one
of
those
that
you
try
and
are
so
blown
away
by
the
experience
that
cant
wait
to
share
the
details
would
be
ecstatic
to
somehow
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
this
awesome
best
barleywine
ive
had
to
date
very
unique
to
me
at

some

some

silky

all
around
the
most
chocolatey
barleywine
ive
had
this
was
excellent
creamy
sweetness
upfront
with
a
heavy
dose
of
toffee
and
cocoa
nice
touch
of
vanilla
and
oak
a
bit
of
a
roasted
note
in
the
background
helps
it
from
being
too
sweet
fullbodied
and
velvety
smooth
with
each
sip
overall
a
delicious
barrel
aged
beer
nice
to
see
the
blend
of
barley
wine
into
used
bcbs
barrels
o
my
first
impression
was
if
the
beer
taste
half
as
good
as
it
smells
its
going
to
be
pretty
awesome
and
it
is
hovering
somewhere
in
that
land
between
barleywine
and
stout
the
dark
malt
brings
a
nice
chocolate
character
to
the
beer
its
a
sweet
beer
but
not
enough
to
keep
me
from
enjoying
two
in
an
sitting
the
abv
will
do
that
for
me
official
rating
splits
the
middle
pitch
perfect
this
shit
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
and
the
first
5
ive
ever
issued
although
heady
would
have
got
one
if
it
wasnt
so
ugly
ive
heard
gi
zombies
say
yeah
its
good
but
its
no
king
henry
not
sure
how
king
henry
could
improve
much
on
this
but
the
possibility
that
it
does
sure
is
appealing
overall
a
really
tasty
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
the
barrel
presence
is
strong
but
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
stout
finish
the
barrel
flavors
are
great
but
the
base
beer
is
a
bit
thin
and
feels
like
it
could
use
more
body
and
substance
but
thats
only
nitpicking
this
is
pretty
spot
on
o
lighter
and
fruitier
than
the
stout
this
is
a
monster
beer
but
not
stupefying
might
be
my
favorite
of
the
goose
island
bourbon
county
beers
definitely
my
favorite
european
style
barleywine
by
a
mile
overall
this
is
a
good
and
complex
beer
i
like
the
use
of
older
barrels
to
give
the
barleywine
some
room
to
shine
overall
id
say
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
strong
and
it
takes
away
from
the
beer
i
would
certainly
buy
it
again
but
i
am
not
gonna
be
goose
hunting
for
this
pick
as
much
up
as
you
can
if
you
find
it
it
is
worth
a
premium
and
competes
with
fw
sucaba
for
bbbws
o
world
class
nose
with
an
outstandingly
complex
flavor
profile
at
this
level
of
quality
the
less
significant
nitpicky
aspects
of
the
brew
start
coming
into
play
and
the
bcb
barelywine
comes
up
a
little
short
of
perfect
theres
a
distracting
abrupt
transition
early
in
the
flavor
profile
that
id
prefer
to
have
smoothed
out
and
on
net
the
sweetness
is
just
a
shade
past
ideal
that
said
the
flavor
is
still
outstanding
and
the
mouthfeel
is
outrageous
particularly
for
the
abv
o
im
impressed
with
this
beer
more
than
ive
been
with
bcbs
recently
especially
because
the
aroma
of
dark
fruity
sugars
that
instantly
started
emanated
from
the
glass
reminded
me
of
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
dfhs
raison
dextra
hope
they
continue
this
one
for
many
years
and
hey
how
about
a
chocolatecoffee
variant
next
year
a
man
can
dream
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
small
quickly
fading
head
not
much
lacing
this
is
the
darkest
barleywine
ive
ever
seen
the
best
word
to
describe
the
aroma
is
wow
raisin
molasses
bourbon
licorice
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
tobacco
this
smells
amazing
this
is
one
sweet
barleywine
raisins
and
molasses
hit
the
palate
first
giving
way
to
bourbon
notes
with
a
sweet
chocolate
finish
the
sweetness
mutes
the
12
abv
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
english
barleywine
great
job
goose
island
very
well
worth
chasing
down
oanother
superb
world
class
offering
o
though
this
is
a
really
good
barleywine
i
still
prefer
normal
bcbs
i
think
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
bit
better
since
i
love
bc
and
it
did
not
live
quite
up
to
my
expectations
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
fairly
good
drinkability
considering
what
this
beer
is
gotta
say
i
prefer
central
waters
bbbw
compared
to
this
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
duckrabbit
snifter
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
consistent
halfinch
tancolored
head
that
sizzles
and
dissipates
towards
the
shoulders
forming
a
creamy
ring
some
lacing
present
but
no
retention
nose
expresses
vanilla
butterscotch
and
ethanol
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
a
bit
more
sugary
and
flavorful
than
suggested
by
the
aromas
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
but
comes
off
a
little
thin
for
the
style
texture
is
slightly
oily
and
carbonation
while
light
and
even
could
be
a
little
less
assertive
overall
a
very
good
english
barleywine
however
im
not
sure
it
warrants
a
100
rating
as
of
this
review
that
said
ill
throw
a
bottle
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
it
develops
poured
into
lost
abbey
teku
on

edit
if
i
could
give
this
motherfker
a
10
instead
of
a
5
i
would
its
better
everytime
i
drink
it
easily
easily
eclipes
any
barleywine
ive
ever
had
and
quite
possibly
any
beer
ive
ever
had
it
is
embarassingly
delicious
and
imo
the
best
of
any
of
the
bourbon
county
offerings
pours
a
dark
opaque
near
black
with
a
thick
but
quickly
fading
dark
yellowkhaki
head
not
much
lace
or
retention
balanced
restrained
nose
of
oak
burnt
sugar
caramel
toffee
and
molasses
flavor
is
overly
sweet
barrel
heavy
with
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
syrupy
caramel
combining
with
a
sticky
malty
english
bw
base
on
its
own
this
was
interesting
but
next
to
a
well
aged
king
henry
seemed
comically
simple
and
boring
body
is
pleasantly
viscous
and
slick
with
minimal
heat
in
the
finish
not
sure
this
needs
much
age
but
hopefully
some
time
will
rejigger
these
flavors
into
a
more
interesting
combination
for
price
and
difficulty
in
obtaining
bottles
just
go
blow
your
money
of
bb4d
or
central
waters
or
something
0
very
well
done
wish
i
could
have
bought
more
than
one
bottle
really
feel
this
is
a
beer
worth
aging
an
extremely
well
thought
out
beer
nicely
blended
this
is
nearly
the
benchmark
for
all
bwine
not
surprisingly
just
a
small
step
behind
king
henry
highly
recommended
especially
5
5012oz
this
should
be
considered
a
must
find
highly
drinkable
o
overall
an
outstanding
brew
ive
never
had
a
barleywine
in
boubon
barrels
and
it
blends
together
quite
nicely
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
all
the
different
layers
of
this
beer
one
of
the
darkest
barleywines
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
at
first
glance
one
might
think
it
is
a
stout
till
you
hold
it
up
to
some
light
tastes
a
lot
like
bourbon
county
stout
with
a
little
more
sweetness
a
very
good
beer
but
imo
not
worth
all
the
hype
if
you
want
a
bourbon
forward
beer
this
would
be
a
great
choice
what
a
beer
its
amazing
how
much
bourbon
is
in
this
beer
considering
its
a
third
use
barrel
when
i
say
this
beer
is
alcoholic
or
boozey
i
mean
that
in
the
best
way
possible
just
as
good
as
king
henry
i
kind
of
fail
to
find
any
bourbon
county
flavors
as
i
did
with
king
henry
other
than
the
bourbon
but
im
sure
its
just
adding
to
the
overall
complexity
overall
this
is
a
really
well
done
beer
very
complex
only
flaw
is
the
finish
it
ends
a
bit
too
syrupy
otherwise
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
fully
body
and
syrupy
with
very
mild
carbonation
very
sticky
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
overall
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
not
as
harsh
fresh
as
normal
bcbs
great
depth
of
flavor
and
well
integrated
bourbon
notes
that
arent
overpowering
get
it
if
you
have
the
chance
o
what
an
accomplishment
goose
island
has
here
ive
loved
every
variant
of
bourbon
county
that
ive
had
the
privilege
of
trying
but
i
think
this
may
be
my
favorite
curse
you
goose
island
i
need
to
hunt
a
king
henry
down
now
curse
you
inbev
o
just
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
im
no
barleywine
fan
by
any
means
but
this
easily
the
best
one
ive
had
o
very
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easy
very
strong
kick
slightly
filling
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
highabv
beer
to
sip
on
for
a
long
time
stunning
aroma
and
taste
with
beautiful
balance
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
a
masterpiece
the
only
flaw
i
can
personally
find
in
this
beautifully
complex
ale
is
the
heaviness
of
the
body
not
all
barleywines
drink
like
a
dessert
and
i
think
this
one
could
benefit
from
losing
a
little
bit
of
body
overall
though
this
is
world
class
stuff
o
as
if
this
wasnt
going
to
be
excellent
very
similar
to
their
retired
king
henry
and
a
worthy
successor
dont
pass
it
up
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
2013
tons
of
rich
flavor
not
overpowered
by
the
barrel
m
full
bodied
and
chewy
round
poured
into
half
acre
snifter
pours
a
deep
hazy
brown
with
minimal
head
and
no
retention
the
nose
is
delightful
starts
with
notes
of
bourbon
soaked
raisins
figs
heavy
caramel
and
notes
of
bcs
peaking
through
which
brings
some
fudge
to
the
party
taste
starts
with
caramel
and
large
bcs
influence
the
bourbon
melds
vary
nicely
with
the
base
beer
tons
of
complexity
in
the
way
of
dark
fruits
caramel
and
chocolate
the
finish
leans
towards
the
sweet
side
and
has
a
nice
bitter
cocoa
note
on
the
end
mouthfeel
is
big
viscous
and
mildly
carbonated
overall
this
is
right
there
with
king
henry
granted
it
has
been
a
while
since
my
last
taste
of
king
henry
but
i
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
remember
enjoying
king
henry
its
nice
to
see
that
goose
brought
back
the
king
in
a
way
i
must
say
that
i
am
well
satisfied
im
also
a
big
fan
of
this
being
in
12
oz
bottles
its
not
everyday
that
i
want
to
go
crack
a
bomber
of
a
12
barleywine
but
12
ounces
is
way
more
manageable
delicious
this
is
a
seriously
amazing
barleywine
a
huge
beer
with
tons
and
tons
of
flavor
pours
a
very
deep
mahogany
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
tinge
thin
khaki
color
head
with
little
retention
huge
aroma
of
bourbon
molasses
red
oak
caramel
tobacco
cocoa
and
wine
just
to
name
a
few
as
the
beer
warms
it
goes
through
several
phases
with
different
detectable
aromas
taste
is
wonderful
sweet
bourbon
and
oak
upfront
vanilla
cherries
banana
and
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
a
fortified
port
and
sherry
wonderfully
complex
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
rich
some
moderate
carbonation
brings
some
of
the
lighter
flavors
to
life
not
much
booze
on
the
palette
but
you
can
feel
it
in
your
nose
and
stomach
very
warming
on
a
winter
night
overall
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
barleywine
but
id
have
to
compare
this
and
firestones
stickee
monkey
sidebyside
superb
brew
o
takes
barleywine
to
a
new
level
with
added
flavor
and
at
first
at
least
particularly
wellcovered
high
abv
curious
that
unlike
the
bcb
stout
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
bourbon
aroma
or
flavor
considering
this
was
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
perhaps
its
because
the
barrels
are
third
use
with
bcbs
having
already
absorbed
much
of
the
bourbon
in
the
wood
o
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
i
just
wish
the
nose
was
as
rich
as
the
flavour
i
bet
age
is
going
to
make
this
wonderful
not
overly
sweet
this
has
so
much
going
for
it
tons
of
upside
here
this
is
almost
completely
black
and
you
can
start
to
smell
it
from
a
foot
away
lots
of
chocolate
vanilla
dark
caramel
and
spices
a
similar
flavor
profile
with
less
roast
chocolate
and
more
dark
sugar
a
bit
of
alcoholic
warmth
in
huge
finish
and
lots
of
vanilla
and
whiskey
character
it
smells
great
though
the
bourbon
is
almost
too
much
and
really
tends
to
overwhelm
everything
else
especially
in
the
flavor
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
barley
and
bourbon
scents
the
taste
is
sweet
and
has
a
thick
volume
to
it
that
you
have
come
to
expect
with
the
bourbon
county
label
among
the
molasses
and
sweet
flavor
is
just
the
right
amount
of
rye
flavor
with
hints
of
vanilla
very
delicious
and
very
drinkable
thick
lightly
carbonated
and
definitely
a
sipper
that
should
be
a
prime
candidate
for
any
cellar
o
it
is
no
kh
so
people
can
stop
with
that
it
is
however
a
really
nice
ba
barleywine
it
has
everything
i
love
in
a
ba
barleywine
and
it
was
still
fairly
easy
to
finish
i
am
going
to
need
to
get
a
few
bottles
of
this
before
its
all
gone
gi
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
again
wish
i
couldve
landed
more
hopefully
i
can
trade
for
some
without
sacrificing
children
or
appendages
o
just
an
intense
beer
an
extremely
enjoyable
experience
to
drink
the
aroma
flavor
and
feel
are
just
incredible
really
different
than
anything
i
have
had
hard
to
compare
it
to
the
great
barleywines
out
there
since
this
one
drinks
somewhat
like
a
stout
extremely
well
done
one
to
savor
and
enjoy
every
drop
of
o
overall
i
didnt
really
believe
all
the
praise
but
believe
it
this
beer
is
the
truth
must
hunt
down
additional
bottles
overall
i
havent
had
king
henry
in
a
while
but
this
is
very
similar
imo
i
can
see
this
getting
even
better
with
a
year
on
it
but
that
doesnt
mean
you
should
wait
this
is
drinking
balls
deep
amazing
right
now
this
was
just
as
good
as
id
hoped
it
would
be
cant
say
im
disappointed
at
all
except
for
the
fact
that
i
dont
have
more
cheers
d
a
beer
that
is
surprisingly
tame
and
i
mean
this
in
a
very
good
way
given
its
high
abv
and
bourbon
barrel
aging
near
perfect
in
all
facets
a
bit
more
impressive
appearance
and
a
bit
more
of
potent
nose
could
make
this
a
perfect
5
across
the
board
i
cant
recommend
highly
enough
as
a
limited
release
english
barleywine
or
bourbon
barrel
aged
offering
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
any
self
respecting
ba
could
find
fault
with
this
offering
o
the
bourbon
county
series
sometimes
gets
a
tad
overhyped
but
i
must
say
this
one
is
superbly
blended
the
only
criticism
is
perhaps
a
little
too
thick
and
frothy
but
overall
well
done
o
seems
to
be
more
of
a
light
colored
imperial
stout
but
thats
fine
with
me
i
love
this
beer
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
bcbs
barrels
is
unmistakeable
ive
seen
many
beers
called
the
perfect
winter
warmer
but
i
think
this
one
really
is
a
wonderful
addition
to
the
bourbon
county
line
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
barleywines
o
rich
and
flavorful
overall
nothing
like
any
other
barleywine
i
have
had
as
aging
it
in
barrels
that
once
held
bourbon
county
stout
that
of
course
held
bourbon
before
that
as
done
sublime
things
to
the
base
beer
extraordinary
and
i
will
likely
never
have
it
again
o
this
is
great
lots
of
decadence
lots
of
flavor
that
you
can
really
sit
on
for
a
bit
and
may
still
not
have
a
full
read
on
all
this
brew
has
to
offer
look
forward
to
seeing
how
it
ages
big
sticky
and
sweet
nicely
warming
and
complex
o
absolutely
superb
it
is
literally
king
henry
jr
a
superb
barleywine
with
superb
barrel
aging
king
henry
is
still
better
but
this
is
an
excellent
replacement
deep
amber
almost
brown
body
with
highlights
around
the
glass
that
catch
the
light
in
the
room
there
are
limited
cream
colored
bubbles
that
require
agitation
the
smell
is
dark
fruits
toffee
caramel
oak
and
light
booze
this
beer
is
quite
complex
you
get
all
the
flavors
from
the
nose
some
candi
sugar
as
well
it
is
not
cloying
sweet
there
is
some
bourbon
with
a
few
notes
of
bcbs
like
vanilla
and
roast
mostly
toffee
and
dark
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
satisfying
top
notch
brew
cant
wait
until
my
next
one
wonderful
dessert
like
flavors
mixed
with
a
subtle
sweet
boozey
character
great
example
of
a
barrel
aged
english
barleywine
glad
i
got
a
bit
of
this
to
age
i
only
see
it
improving
nice
job
goose
islandabi
this
is
a
beer
that
is
worth
fighting
in
line
over
on
black
friday
although
i
wasnt
in
a
place
where
they
did
the
black
friday
release
marvelous
barleywine
that
i
really
enjoyed
nowhere
near
king
henry
level
no
other
barleywine
is
ever
going
to
match
that
but
this
is
still
pretty
good
i
dont
see
any
point
in
aging
this
this
beer
is
ready
to
drink
fresh
overall
a
real
unique
tasting
barleywine
that
hints
almost
into
large
dark
fruit
territory
but
is
sort
of
not
what
i
expected
or
look
for
in
this
style
it
is
however
a
very
unique
tasting
brew
and
memorable
a
mix
of
classic
goose
island
stout
barrel
aging
and
fruit
barleywine
character
not
unlike
king
henry
certainly
deserving
of
the
bourbon
county
brand
this
barleywine
rivals
its
imperial
stout
sibling
definitely
worth
seeking
out
o
this
is
probably
the
3rd
best
barleywine
ive
had
the
k13
and
then
aged
kh
second
want
infinitely
more
of
this
single
finger
off
white
head
on
a
very
deep
dark
amber
brown
body
with
excellent
lacing
aroma
is
a
bit
light
with
notes
if
dark
fruit
caramel
some
coffee
and
the
bourbon
but
mild
flavor
follows
with
more
dark
fruit
mostly
raisin
dark
grapes
and
strawberry
follows
buy
caramel
malts
coffee
and
brown
sugar
rounded
off
at
the
end
by
the
bourbon
finish
this
one
is
unapologetically
boozy
medium
to
full
body
and
light
carbonation
although
i
have
had
better
barleywines
few
compare
to
this
one
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
awesome
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
tons
of
delicious
bourbon
fruits
and
caramel
to
it
and
there
it
is
not
too
hot
love
that
it
is
coming
in
12
oz
bottles
too
reminds
me
a
bit
of
king
henry
though
a
bit
more
dark
fruits
well
worth
it
glad
to
have
a
few
bottles
and
really
hope
they
make
this
year
round
this
is
a
medium
to
fuller
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
a
boozy
sipper
that
is
quite
complex
and
certainly
worth
seeking
out
considering
the
amount
of
bourbon
county
stout
that
wasis
made
i
hope
this
means
this
brew
will
see
greater
volumedistribution
in
the
future
this
offering
comes
out
with
the
bar
set
unreasonably
high
falling
in
the
wake
of
king
henry
i
wont
draw
any
comparisons
to
that
brew
but
wow
is
this
good
and
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
damn
i
would
like
more
of
this
compared
to
firestone
walker
special
releasesmaybe
overall
i
suppose
i
should
have
expected
the
unexpected
from
a
beer
aged
in
barrels
that
had
previously
aged
bcbs
that
had
originally
been
bourbon
barrels
that
said
i
was
surprised
by
quite
a
few
aspects
of
this
beer
this
is
quite
a
tasty
treat
but
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
it
does
in
a
year
or
two
overall
well
this
didnt
disappoint
super
complex
and
flavorful
and
goes
down
smooth
as
hell
this
is
absolutely
worthy
of
the
bourbon
county
label
o
i
think
this
beer
is
right
up
there
with
king
henry
hate
all
you
want
i
know
its
a
different
beer
and
it
shows
but
damnit
all
i
like
it
just
as
much
as
the
king
overall
the
comparisons
to
king
henry
dont
do
king
henry
justice
the
bourbon
character
just
isnt
as
incredible
a
tasty
barleywine
nonetheless

i
was
extremely
impressed
with
this
offering
it
brings
this
style
to
a
whole
new
level
a
definite
oneup
from
other
barrel
aged
barleywines
ive
tried
complex
packed
full
of
flavor
and
best
of
all
available
in
4
packs
so
you
can
enjoy
one
without
sacrificing
an
expensive
bomber
every
time
youre
craving
one
very
deep
chestnut
brown
color
very
dark
though
appears
somewhat
muddy
looking
not
much
carbonation
going
on
here
vinuous
aroma
of
treacle
burnt
sugars
and
a
whole
lot
of
bready
malt
the
intense
bourbon
has
faded
somewhat
as
it
has
warmed
mellow
oakiness
with
the
underlying
bourbon
thick
caramel
flavors
with
a
nice
highlight
of
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
somewhat
of
a
sherry
tinge
the
bourbon
tends
to
linger
on
the
palate
smooth
and
sticky
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
booziness
just
a
great
beer
all
in
really
was
afraid
the
bourbon
would
be
too
much
but
it
all
is
balanced
exceptionally
well
and
i
thought
the
stout
would
be
hard
to
topthis
almost
comes
close
im
not
the
most
wellversed
on
english
barleywines
but
this
is
certainly
the
best
i
have
had
extremely
complex
wonderful
beer
overall
pretty
impressive
strong
and
full
of
flavor
this
may
have
the
bourbon
county
brand
name
on
it
but
it
truly
is
its
own
beer
cant
wait
to
see
what
a
little
time
will
do
big
english
style
for
sure
fantastic
o
this
is
a
damn
impressive
beer
just
so
smooth
right
out
of
the
gate
and
layer
upon
layer
of
complexity
really
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
left
verdict
a
knockout
barleywine
from
goose
island
its
not
quite
as
rounded
and
balanced
as
king
henry
but
its
wonderful
and
showcases
the
barleywine
qualities
nicely
the
old
stout
is
expressed
well
but
doesnt
dominate
and
the
raisin
quality
is
really
pleasant
no
surprises
here
just
artfully
crafter
beer
outstanding
another
impressive
notch
in
the
belt
of
gis
barrel
aged
portfolio
however
this
is
still
an
insanely
complex
barrel
aged
barleywine
there
so
much
going
on
that
its
hard
to
pick
out
everything
ehh
not
quite
worth
the
hype
here
but
still
pretty
damn
good
o
a
great
beer
im
just
sad
i
could
only
find
one
bottle
of
the
stuff
next
year
will
be
a
different
story
though
you
can
bet
on
that
old
alesbarleywines
are
easily
my
favorite
style
and
this
one
reminded
me
of
bells
third
coast
old
reserve
which
is
aged
in
spent
black
note
barrels
similar
to
this
beer
would
really
love
to
try
the
base
beer
of
this
sometime
o
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
i
am
so
turned
off
by
the
prices
some
of
these
breweries
charge
now
for
a
brewery
that
is
focused
on
efficiency
and
was
just
bought
by
inbev
that
this
will
be
the
last
time
that
i
try
to
seek
this
out
they
will
have
tons
of
this
stuff
left
over
once
inbev
gets
their
hands
around
the
brewers
throats
and
i
just
wont
pay
that
much
for
a
four
pack
what
a
joke
to
see
shops
holding
back
on
selling
a
4
pack
to
someone
based
on
their
familiarity
with
the
shopper
craft
beer
is
dying
and
im
tired
of
this
hipster
selling
practice
overall
very
good
barleywine
great
balance
dangerously
drinkable
o
before
bcbbw
i
thought
wulver
was
the
pinnacle
of
what
bourbon
barrelaging
could
do
for
a
beer
ive
now
had
the
two
side
by
side
and
i
really
cant
decide
which
i
like
better
this
is
a
truly
marvelous
beer
and
the
chocolate
flavors
really
take
this
englishstyle
barley
wine
to
a
new
level
rich
like
warren
buffett
smooth
as
lou
rawls
voice
full
bodied
minimal
effervescence
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
this
reminds
me
of
the
sam
adams
triple
bock
i
had
in
1999
thick
boozy
warming
delicious
better
warm
room
temperature
for
this
one
a
bit
syrupy
at
the
swallow
is
the
only
knock
against
it
if
you
can
you
better
or
youll
hate
yourself
later
im
glad
i
have
a
4
pack
sitting
at
home
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
mocha
colored
head
that
leaves
behind
a
very
thin
ring
of
lacing
smells
of
tons
of
toffee
and
carmel
some
chocolate
hint
of
coffee
oak
some
vanilla
molasses
bourbon
goodness
slight
dark
fruit
very
complex
aroma
taste
is
just
as
complex
starts
with
the
typical
toffeecarmel
as
well
as
dark
fruit
and
molasses
the
middle
then
brings
in
the
outstanding
barrel
qualities
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
meld
into
the
toffee
carmel
molasses
and
dark
fruits
the
finish
is
heavenly
big
sweetness
from
the
carmel
toffee
and
molasses
along
with
dark
fruits
like
raisins
vanilla
bittering
hops
oak
and
a
good
amount
of
bourbon
getting
a
butterscotch
note
in
there
too
also
get
bcbs
qualities
from
the
barrel
which
stands
this
beer
out
in
terms
of
ba
barleywines
get
some
chocolate
and
roastiness
that
go
really
well
with
all
the
other
sweet
flavors
warming
sensation
going
down
but
not
really
hot
full
body
with
a
creamy
and
sticky
feel
to
it
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
did
not
think
it
would
but
this
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
glad
i
was
able
to
pick
up
a
lot
of
this
an
extremely
complex
and
outstanding
beer
overall
i
had
a
bottle
of
king
henry
about
two
weeks
ago
and
the
experience
is
still
fairly
fresh
in
my
mind
because
king
henry
is
still
kicking
ass
if
you
cellared
your
bottle
properly
i
think
that
bourbon
county
barleywine
has
a
little
weaker
barrel
presence
in
nose
and
flavor
profile
than
king
henry
but
the
mouthfeel
seems
better
than
king
henry
did
fresh
bourbon
county
barleywine
is
a
bit
more
fruity
than
king
henry
it
seems
as
though
more
of
the
base
beer
comes
through
in
bourbon
county
barleywine
it
also
seems
that
king
henry
is
a
little
more
barrel
forward
of
an
english
barleywine
than
bourbon
county
barleywine
with
all
that
said
great
effort
on
this
beer
and
i
will
gladly
seek
out
more
of
this
beer
thank
you
goose
island
for
putting
a
great
english
barleywine
into
a
small
format
bottle
and
in
4
packs
to
boot
i
dont
know
of
many
barrel
aged
english
barleywines
that
come
in
single
serve
bottles
that
are
at
this
high
of
quality
i
think
that
this
will
also
be
a
good
beer
to
sit
on
it
should
age
well
welcome
to
the
bourbon
county
family
bourbon
county
barleywine
hoping
that
you
become
a
yearly
release
a
great
addition
to
the
bourbon
county
line
and
a
fantastic
ba
bw
worth
seeking
out
this
longawaited
treasure
actually
showed
up
in
midmissouri
much
to
my
surprise
and
a
4pk
set
me
back
about
18
00
figured
id
try
one
fresh
and
age
the
rest
the
bottledon
date
here
shows
september
24th
2013
an
elevated
pour
into
my
duvel
tulip
shows
a
dark
walnut
beer
crowned
with
a
tan
cap
which
on
account
of
the
pour
and
the
nucleation
in
the
tulip
actually
shows
a
bit
better
retention
than
i
was
expecting
bcb
is
almost
completely
opaque
though
there
are
a
few
garnet
highlights
at
the
bottom
of
the
tulip
when
held
to
the
light
a
riot
of
red
and
dark
fruit
notes
emerges
first
and
these
are
followed
by
some
toasty
brown
malt
notes
a
hint
of
nuttiness
and
faint
notes
of
whiskey
and
wood
perhaps
a
ghostly
note
of
burnt
molasses
as
this
approaches
room
temperature
possibly
from
the
bcbs
contribution
on
the
palate
this
shows
strong
notes
of
booze
up
front
the
booze
stops
just
short
of
being
hot
and
if
it
werent
for
the
intense
flavors
and
significant
sweetness
this
might
seem
a
bit
overthetop
in
terms
of
alcoholic
strength
the
flavors
are
a
bit
muddled
at
this
point
but
theres
sweet
sticky
dark
caramel
some
dark
red
fruits
just
a
bit
of
toasted
nuttiness
and
just
the
slightest
hint
of
something
im
not
entirely
enamored
withperhaps
just
a
slightly
metallic
edge
to
the
molasses
flavors
something
readily
apparent
in
many
highoctane
imperial
stouts
including
bcbs
when
young
but
im
guessing
that
this
will
mellow
with
age
rich
thick
boozy
mouthfeel
rich
almost
beyond
description
is
it
king
henry
not
quite
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
englishstyle
barleywine
and
one
which
i
have
no
doubt
will
improve
o
this
is
a
great
great
beer
if
you
are
lucky
enough
get
your
hands
on
it
it
lives
up
to
the
rest
of
the
bourbon
county
family
overall
this
is
very
impressive
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
the
regular
bourbon
county
and
this
barleywine
base
puts
on
some
serious
competition
if
you
see
a
bottle
do
not
hesitate
to
pick
it
up
this
is
worth
top
dollar
o
this
was
a
fantastic
barleywine
that
is
easily
up
there
with
the
best
its
still
fairly
hot
right
now
but
i
think
it
will
be
perfect
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
ive
found
that
i
love
barleywines
that
are
used
in
third
use
barrels
after
holding
high
quality
bourbon
and
a
stout
i
feel
like
the
stout
adds
an
additional
complexity
to
the
barleywine
bringing
out
more
dark
fruits
overall
im
glad
i
joined
the
masses
searching
for
this
on
black
friday
i
just
wish
i
could
have
found
more
then
three
bottles
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
for
some
reason
i
think
i
actually
preferred
this
one
to
king
henry
though
ill
admit
i
drank
kh
some
time
ago
and
have
had
many
many
beers
in
the
interim
nevertheless
this
one
should
be
much
easier
to
find
while
still
worth
the
search
oda
decadent
barleywine
a
solid
addition
to
the
bourbon
county
lineup
definitely
worth
a
bottle
if
you
stumble
upon
it
somewhere
between
very
good
and
excellent
o
my
favorite
barleywine
to
date
edit
had
king
henry
right
after
this
and
that
blows
this
brew
away
i
have
only
had
white
chocolate
and
blighs
barleywine
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
thin
beige
head
aromas
of
bourbon
toffee
malt
oak
oh
my
smells
fantastic
the
taste
follows
suit
rich
and
smooth
elegant
and
just
a
lovely
beer
to
sip
delicate
alcoholic
warmth
in
the
finish
as
good
as
i
hoped
i
was
able
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
before
black
friday
5
99
color
is
super
dark
brown
head
died
quick
fast
aroma
is
whiskey
sweet
fruity
flavor
is
fruity
boozy
and
might
even
have
a
touch
of
bourbon
county
stout
but
maybe
that
is
the
power
of
suggestion
overall
pretty
solid
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
but
to
me
not
as
good
as
blighs
or
abacus
i
never
had
the
original
king
henry
either
so
i
cant
speak
to
that
one
still
glad
i
bought
a
couple
bottles
overall
pretty
tasty
but
you
had
better
like
whiskey
if
you
drink
this
o
this
ale
blew
me
away
not
only
is
this
the
best
ba
barley
wine
ive
ever
had
its
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
general
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
have
this
repeatedly
over
the
year
and
it
is
amazing
it
has
changed
but
not
dramatically
like
some
barley
wines
i
dont
know
how
they
did
it
but
the
3
use
barrel
aging
must
be
the
way
to
go
hats
off
this
great
idea
by
goose
island
pours
a
rich
and
full
bodied
dark
dark
charred
rosewood
in
color
with
a
one
finger
very
creamy
one
finger
beige
head
as
the
beer
pools
in
the
glass
it
actually
comes
just
short
of
being
black
if
you
saw
it
from
a
distance
you
could
easily
mistake
it
for
an
imperial
stout
it
fully
coats
the
glass
and
possesses
a
good
amount
of
residual
sugar
the
nose
is
actually
very
similar
to
bourbon
county
it
is
a
touch
sweeter
and
and
lacks
the
complete
richness
that
accompanies
bourbon
county
but
i
can
say
that
it
certainly
doesnt
smell
too
much
like
any
other
barleywines
out
there
king
henry
excluded
of
course
the
stout
influence
is
impressive
the
beer
is
big
and
rich
it
features
big
sweet
malt
with
candied
sugars
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
roast
and
drinks
like
it
is
half
bourbon
county
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
i
love
how
much
the
bourbon
county
influence
shows
itself
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
resonating
for
a
few
minutes
it
drinks
full
bodied
and
is
very
smooth
it
isnt
hot
at
all
unlike
king
henry
when
it
was
released
this
is
a
very
well
rounded
and
polished
beer
from
goose
island
im
very
impressed
im
sure
this
will
be
all
that
most
people
could
imagine
a
barleywine
could
be
o
this
is
a
great
barleywine
and
one
that
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
it
reminds
me
of
king
henry
without
the
butterscotch
from
the
pvw
barrels
this
really
shows
to
me
that
the
second
use
bcbs
barrels
3rd
use
overall
barrels
as
they
like
to
call
it
helps
adds
the
distinctive
chocolate
flavor
and
smoothness
in
this
barleywine
i
definitely
plan
on
aging
more
of
these
and
hope
this
isnt
a
one
off
from
them
overall
a
great
addition
to
the
bourbon
county
brand
would
highly
recommend
this
to
all
barleywine
fans
all
bcbs
fans
and
all
beer
drinkers
toffee
and
caramel
in
spades
bourbonsoaked
wood
vanilla
plum
malty
bread
crust
in
the
aftertaste
and
dry
wood
full
bodied
and
smooth
though
the
bourbon
is
fully
present
its
more
of
a
warming
feeling
very
rich
but
drinkable
with
some
nice
complexity
from
both
the
barrel
and
base
beer
different
from
king
henry
obviously
but
not
a
bad
substitute
by
any
means
not
overpowering
sweet
but
not
syrupy
and
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
on
the
tongue
excellent
aroma
plenty
of
toffee
and
burnt
sugar
in
the
nose
i
am
glad
i
picked
some
of
this
up
in
colorado
last
year
2013
version
little
to
no
head
little
lacing
toffee
sweet
bourbon
barrel
flavor
i
remember
this
one
having
a
fuller
body
dont
see
why
others
are
so
high
on
this
very
average
barrelaged
barley
wine
across
the
board
imo
overall
great
stuff
thats
everything
a
ba
barleywine
should
be
without
excessive
anything
i
expect
sweetness
from
a
barleywine
and
sweetness
from
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
but
this
is
a
bit
much
for
me
very
sweet
with
an
almost
syrupy
characteristic
beyond
what
i
would
ever
want
very
sad
about
this
as
i
really
like
their
vanilla
porter
pours
a
hazy
redorange
smells
of
bourbon
sweet
malts
and
booze
dominant
sweet
bourbon
flavor
caramel
sweet
malts
sweet
heavy
body
with
medlight
carbonation
not
as
obnoxiously
sweet
as
it
warmed
but
still
too
much
for
me
verdict
a
very
delicious
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
from
dry
dock
definitely
up
there
in
the
pantheon
for
this
style
and
definitely
an
underrated
beer
although
the
ratings
seem
to
indicate
its
quality
so
perhaps
its
a
underknown
beer
that
isnt
as
heralded
as
the
rest
perfect
for
a
fall
or
winter
evening
to
sip
on
delicious
o
pretty
tasty
and
surprisingly
close
to
a
good
but
nonba
barleywine
sweetness
is
a
tad
high
though
overall
very
enjoyable
very
different
from
its
other
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
brethren
not
a
whole
lot
of
barrel
character
but
i
get
dark
fruits
caramel
brown
sugar
candy
and
toffee
love
the
nameart
work
on
this
beer
no
doubt
captain
bligh
wouldve
avoided
mutiny
had
his
ship
been
well
stocked
with
this
fine
ale
will
be
looking
for
more
this
is
a
fine
barley
wine
that
certainly
benefits
from
the
barrel
recommended
for
a
ba
ale
o
really
good
english
barleywine
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
a
lot
and
so
did
everyone
else
however
for
an
barrelaged
english
barleywine
this
beer
lacks
a
lot
of
the
distinct
whiskey
character
that
makes
a
ba
english
barleywine
what
it
is
overall
an
excellent
brew
but
certainly
overrated
especially
considering
the
price
point
0
very
very
good
probably
shouldnt
age
longer
than
a
year
its
not
showing
any
oxidation
just
thinnish
and
lacking
carbonation
flavor
is
beautiful
ala
jw
lees
mouthfeeloverall
medium
mouthfeel
which
seems
about
right
but
almost
devoid
of
carbonation
certainly
a
miss
there
overall
some
very
nice
flavors
and
a
good
base
beer
but
for
me
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
retracts
from
most
of
the
other
aspects
add
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
i
like
it
a
lot
more
a
really
good
barrelaged
english
barleywine
on
the
level
of
sucaba
has
warmth
depth
and
deliciousness
rich
sweet
and
incredibly
smooth
yum
overall
no
booze
detected
drinkability
is
great
a
super
smooth
barley
wine
that
isnt
too
sweet
or
heavy
on
the
barrel
now
i
understand
why
this
beer
underwhelmed
against
the
likes
of
mother
of
all
storms
king
henry
other
heavyweights
a
pretty
good
barrelaged
barleywine
but
just
not
in
the
same
weight
class
pours
murky
brownamber
in
color
with
a
razor
thin
offwhite
head
that
diminished
fairly
quickly
big
toffee
caramel
light
coconut
a
hint
of
vanilla
somewhat
nutty
figs
raisins
spicy
oak
and
almonds
in
the
aroma
taste
is
big
figs
dark
fruits
with
a
touch
of
spice
hints
of
cinnamon
and
coconut
through
the
middle
with
lighter
notes
of
sweet
caramel
and
brown
sugar
ending
with
a
light
alcoholic
bite
on
the
backend
slick
mouthfeel
with
almost
no
carbonation
throughout
overall
a
very
solid
barleywine
that
was
not
overpowered
by
the
barrel
treatment
this
was
too
tough
for
me
to
come
by
to
seek
this
out
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
dont
know
what
it
is
so
i
cant
say
if
ive
had
it
before
but
age
has
clearly
treated
it
kindly
its
not
terribly
complex
but
what
is
there
is
quality

o
really
good
and
sweet
barleywine
with
nice
chocolate
flavor
to
it
as
well
not
as
good
as
kh
but
pretty
close
true
to
form
with
a
very
subtle
barrelaged
twist
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
get
it
if
you
can
overall
a
very
nice
english
style
barleywine
that
is
drinking
magnificently
almost
two
years
in
o
pretty
good
for
a
barleywine
barrel
does
a
nice
job
was
better
when
i
had
it
alone
than
at
a
barleywine
tasting
but
i
think
that
was
simply
due
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
line
up
dry
dock
copied
anchor
old
foghorn
on
the
color
just
perfect
for
the
style
ok
when
you
look
up
malt
bomb
in
your
text
books
this
is
what
you
will
see
sweet
sweet
sugar
plums
with
a
hint
of
pancake
syrup
really
nice
nose
this
is
an
english
barleywine
taste
just
like
the
nose
with
minimal
alcohol
burn
i
will
save
an
ounce
and
half
for
pancakes
in
the
morning
outstanding
job
and
i
hope
the
2012
version
holds
up
to
these
standards
my
dad
would
be
proud
of
this
beer
what
a
fantastic
beer
barrel
aged
beers
are
becoming
more
and
more
prevalent
but
its
still
very
rare
to
find
one
as
well
done
as
this
one
of
the
best
beers
of
this
style
overall
a
letdown
glad
to
have
tried
it
on
a
random
sunday
night
watching
the
walking
dead
with
my
brother
otherwise
id
have
been
more
disappointed
still
glad
to
tick
it
off
the
list
of
ba
barleywines
dry
dock
definitely
has
created
a
strong
offering
in
the
barleywine
category
a
deep
rubybrown
pour
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
receded
to
a
ringlet
and
left
some
doily
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
malts
oak
fruity
esters
booze
taste
of
caramel
malts
toffee
vegetal
vanilla
bean
toasted
oak
soaked
in
whiskey
dark
dried
fruits
leather
tasty
and
complex
heavymedium
body
a
bit
chewy
and
almost
more
reminiscent
of
an
american
than
an
english
barleywine
but
whos
really
keeping
track
very
nice
overall
brown
to
dark
brown
color
what
little
head
there
was
disappeared
quickly
aroma
of
baking
bread
and
prunes
with
a
hint
of
acetone
mediumheavy
body
with
sufficient
carbonation
to
say
beer
and
not
port
which
it
is
very
reminiscent
of
vanilla
dried
apricots
and
soft
caramel
candy
flavors
feels
like
10
but
doesnt
taste
like
it
overall
a
very
worthy
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
low
b
a
fine
beer
ill
have
to
retry
this
one
to
if
the
feel
is
more
than
just
in
one
bottle
o
thankfully
ive
got
a
few
more
of
these
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
will
get
much
better
with
time
its
boozy
delicious
plenty
of
flavors
here
with
the
right
amount
of
whiskey
and
oak
present
great
barleywine
o
pretty
good
i
have
to
admit
i
expected
more
and
am
a
bit
disappointed
for
what
i
spent
not
worth
seeking
out
to
me
but
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
if
you
happen
to
find
it
id
say
this
is
in
the
bottom
portion
of
the
top
tier
of
ba
english
barleywines
i
had
a
hard
time
describing
the
taste
because
this
is
nearly
a
onetrick
pony
with
its
whiskey
notes
combined
with
the
nose
and
mouthfeel
though
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
thanks
4daloveofstout
for
the
trade
a
long
time
ago
overall
this
is
solid
solid
stuff
the
taste
is
the
most
impressive
part
of
the
beer
but
if
the
nose
were
a
little
bolder
and
the
feel
slightly
smoother
this
would
be
a
top
class
beer
as
it
is
now
its
very
enjoyable
and
is
definitely
worth
the
hunt
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
thanks
again
for
the
beers
masterski
o
very
good
barleywine
thick
mouthfeel
covers
up
the
slight
abv
burn
this
beer
still
has
not
in
the
top
tier
of
ba
barleywines
but
close
delicious
though
i
prefer
the
kuhnhenn
bbbw
o
while
i
certainly
like
this
i
had
this
side
by
side
with
king
henry
and
had
hifi
rye
a
little
afterwards
this
just
didnt
hold
up
to
the
big
guys
imo
o
just
excellent
all
the
flavors
are
very
smoothly
integrated
barrelaging
should
always
be
done
like
this
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
one
of
the
better
ba
barleywines
ive
encountered
very
rich
but
so
easy
to
sip
on
thanks
again
exiled
o
this
beer
right
here
its
really
good
overall
incredibly
flavorful
brew
with
tremendous
depth
and
oh
so
smooth
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
big
dog
in
my
favorite
style
category
not
sure
how
this
one
got
slightly
overlooked
and
king
henry
took
center
stage
o
my
small
pour
was
the
perfect
amount
to
enjoy
this
beer
hard
to
really
drink
a
bunch
of
this
stuff
as
with
more
bws
but
its
really
coming
a
long
nicely
from
when
i
had
it
fresh
i
would
say
hold
your
bottles
unless
you
really
like
a
lot
of
booze
in
your
bws
in
the
very
near
future
this
will
be
an
amazing
beer
o
so
very
tasty
the
carmel
flavors
really
dominated
and
i
really
loved
it
wow
very
impressive
drinks
very
smooth
but
has
the
complexity
and
power
present
to
make
this
a
contemplative
sipper
will
definitely
seek
out
more
of
this
o
one
of
the
finest
barleywines
i
have
had
right
there
with
kh
moas
and
sucaba
really
balanced
and
easy
drinking
not
sickeningly
sweet
or
loaded
with
fruit
but
the
barrel
caramel
toffee
and
marshmallow
flavors
are
amazing
i
think
its
decidedly
different
in
that
regard
from
most
of
the
other
top
examples
of
this
style
outstanding
o
a
very
nice
barrel
aged
barleywine
all
tho
i
have
had
better
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
once
the
booze
dies
down
a
little
more
i
think
it
will
greatly
improve
a
very
nice
somewhat
sweet
barrelaged
barleywine

glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
for
sure
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
brew
dry
dock
does
such
amazing
beer
i
need
to
find
more
drink
good
beer
but
think
the
whiskey
couldve
been
switched
out
for
bourbon
too
prickly
for
my
tastes
really
overall
an
excellent
beer
wow
runs
toe
to
toe
with
moas
i
have
to
try
to
get
more
of
this
it
is
a
must
try
for
sure
o
fantastic
beer
hype
train
roll
on
this
one
is
a
bit
cloying
and
hot
at
times
but
overall
a
great
beer
o
incredibly
good
and
incredibly
smooth
this
ranks
right
up
there
with
moas
as
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
o
delicious
so
glad
i
got
a
bottle
before
they
vanished
off
the
shelves
would
gladly
drink
this
again
overall
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
very
solid
wish
i
could
get
it
locally
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
great
beer
the
bourbon
and
barrel
flavors
were
great
in
it
and
were
the
highlight
of
it
for
me
it
was
very
smooth
and
integrated
into
the
beer
flavors
very
solid
barrel
aged
beer
overall
big
toffee
malt
flavor
nutty
semisweet
some
nice
fruitiness
in
the
form
of
date
and
prune
oak
but
not
a
ton
of
overt
bourbon
a
graceful
display
of
oxidation
fullbodied
with
a
slight
tannic
bite
to
the
finish
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
i
love
me
some
barleywine
and
this
one
is
a
good
one
not
sure
what
whiskey
was
used
for
this
but
its
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
it
compliments
the
base
beer
instead
of
overpowering
it
even
at
a
young
age
overall
this
is
a
really
good
barleywine
i
love
caramel
and
bourbon
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
i
have
another
bottle
that
ill
sit
on
for
a
while
and
see
what
happens
with
some
time
o
of
so
nice
and
just
about
everything
i
want
in
a
barleywine
intense
complex
and
smooth
i
think
this
beer
will
only
get
better
with
age
but
time
will
tell
the
various
layers
compliment
each
other
so
well
and
dry
dock
did
a
masterful
job
here
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
barleywine
taste
is
very
complex
and
balanced
and
it
has
a
g
reat
mouthfeel
a
great
beer
that
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
just
makes
me
more
excited
to
crack
my
king
henry
absolutely
amazing
sipper
share
this
one
this
beer
pours
nicely
with
a
good
head
and
some
lace
smell
is
like
bread
kind
of
strange
there
is
too
much
heat
on
this
one
at
10
and
the
wood
is
harsh
makes
it
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
this
was
okay
but
i
dont
know
why
it
is
getting
the
ratings
it
is
ive
opened
some
bottles
that
were
hyped
and
been
really
let
down
and
ive
open
hyped
bottles
and
tried
to
get
up
front
on
the
band
wagon
i
am
driving
the
bus
on
this
one
this
is
a
great
beer
how
dare
they
claim
to
only
make
this
beer
once
seriously
make
this
again
and
again
awesome
d
an
excellent
english
barleywine
that
deserves
plenty
of
praise
a
top
tier
example
and
dangerously
drinkable
beer
is
medium
in
body
sweet
on
the
front
gives
way
to
a
nice
rounded
character
of
oak
and
mild
liquors
strong
but
nice
throughout
i
really
enjoyed
it
id
have
it
again
its
funny
to
me
how
some
beers
become
so
hyped
most
people
who
want
this
beer
have
never
tried
dry
dock
staples
but
for
whatever
reason
they
are
obsessed
with
attaining
this
beer
im
certainly
guilty
of
doing
the
same
with
other
breweries
but
to
me
the
hype
surronding
this
beer
is
particularly
unfounded
and
seemingly
random
the
hype
train
needs
to
slow
down
a
little
bit
but
undeniably
a
great
beer
wish
i
had
more
but
its
all
out
now
pretty
solid
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
trade
for
it
again
not
to
say
that
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
trading
for
the
first
time
worth
trading
for
a
bottle
if
you
really

the

with

i
am
really
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
beer
o
this
is
excellent
it
might
be
the
top
barrel
aged
barley
wine
to
date
for
me
overall
good
but
nothing
really
sets
it
apart
or
pushes
it
above
the
b
range
overall
yes
dry
dock
does
this
beer
style
really
well
its
in
the
same
class
as
fsw
abacus
i
found
myself
sipping
and
savoring
this
beer
do
not
pass
this
beer
up
it
is
phenomenal
cheers
o
good
beer
not
great
a
little
hot
and
much
preferred
the
taste
and
feel
as
opposed
to
the
soft
nose
with
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
sherry
and
this
this
will
develop
into
something
really
good
as
it
feels
bigger
than
what
it
currently
is
o
dry
docks
blighs
barleywine
is
a
really
top
notch
beer
one
where
i
can
actually
understand
some
of
the
hype
but
stepping
back
from
it
and
looking
at
all
the
components
this
barrel
aged
barleywine
is
pretty
unbalanced
and
it
simply
doesnt
reach
the
upper
echelon
of
the
style
worth
trading
for
without
question
just
keep
your
whitest
of
whales
at
bay
d
i
hate
to
say
this
but
over
rated
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
well
down
the
list
of
barrelaged
barleywines
id
want
to
drink
i
struggled
a
bit
through
my
4oz
as
the
alcohol
is
pretty
fierce
at
this
stage
i
can
imagine
this
being
quite
enjoyable
in
612
months
and
will
likely
revisit
my
evaluation
but
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
definitely
not
an
a
drinkability
it
was
hard
to
keep
the
glass
on
the
table
this
is
some
very
fine
stuff
and
maybe
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
tasted
bottle
once
again
hopefully
the
hype
train
stops
in
chicago
for
another
pretty
average
beer
dark
caramel
with
a
whispy
tan
head
nice
coloring
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
but
too
much
oak
dominates
some
really
nice
sweet
malt
but
has
a
wort
or
bready
character
to
it
a
bit
of
molasses
as
well
the
taste
is
all
over
the
place
and
just
weird
very
syrupy
lots
of
oak
and
alcohol
ok
for
a
34
ounces
but
after
that
tough
to
drink
might
be
great
in
time
now
its
merely
a
slightly
above
average
ba
bw
o
while
the
beer
is
quite
good
and
fits
the
style
the
way
it
should
and
it
had
a
lovely
balance
there
isnt
anything
that
screams
world
class
to
me
its
a
very
well
made
beer
though
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
nothing
that
punches
me
in
the
face
its
like
your
best
employee
thats
always
quite
which
you
never
worry
about
but
never
moves
up
because
their
always
in
the
background
o
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
and
will
be
seeking
more
o
very
solid
barleywine
just
tried
it
for
the
first
time
right
after
having
a
mother
of
all
storms
and
while
this
is
good
i
definitely
prefer
the
moas
great
sipping
beer
packed
full
of
flavor
this
is
a
sublime
beer
ive
never
had
anything
else
from
dry
dock
but
i
will
be
seeking
some
more
from
them
its
completely
balanced
with
the
barrel
enhancing
the
base
beer
without
dominating
it
love
it
pours
a
chestnut
with
thin
sheet
of
khaki
head
leaves
a
few
spots
smells
like
a
good
bourbon
vanilla
and
oak
with
raisins
and
caramel
in
the
backround
taste
is
malt
forward
burnt
brown
sugar
molasses
oak
dark
fruits
and
some
alcohol
light
carbonation
works
well
a
very
good
ba
barleywine
that
stands
up
their
with
all
of
the
others
overall
this
could
be
my
new
favorite
barleywine
it
is
incredibly
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
full
flavored
my
12
oz
pour
disappeared
way
too
quickly
and
i
wanted
more
it
would
not
be
hard
to
drink
an
entire
bottle
by
yourself
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
a
side
note
this
beer
was
aged
in
stranahans
whiskey
barrels
so
its
not
bourbon
your
tasting
its
singlemalt
whiskey
made
in
colorado
not
kentucky
medium
to
full
body
is
well
carbonated
not
too
thick
or
cloying
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
depth
in
the
finish
should
age
well
for
at
least
a
few
years
but
is
drinking
pretty
well
right
now
note
not
sure
i
would
call
it
an
american
barleywine
id
say
more
english
hops
arent
really
present
ive
bought
a
couple
more
bottles
and
while
id
love
to
save
them
something
tells
me
theyll
be
gone
before
i
know
it
i
figured
id
give
this
another
shot
and
i
think
the
2012
is
even
better
than
the
2011
fantastic
taste
of
caramel
toffee
whiskey
barrel
strong
but
delicious
this
reminds
me
of
the
fresh
abacus
i
had
in
2011
world
class
the
many
interesting
flavors
in
this
beer
are
a
bit
disjointed
right
now
but
could
easily
come
together
as
something
spectacular
in
the
short
term
2ish
years
more
than
2
years
and
it
might
become
truly
ambrosialike
or
a
soylike
mess
i
hope
to
pick
up
a
number
of
bottles
so
i
can
find
out
overall
this
a
fabulous
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
o
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
all
year
we
put
this
up
against
09
moas
recently
at
a
tasting
and
it
blew
it
out
of
the
water
really
smooth
tons
of
flavor
from
start
to
finish
and
beyond
really
complex
beer
it
sucks
that
stranahans
barrels
will
no
longer
be
used
because
dry
dock
really
nailed
this
one
overall
only
question
is
the
aging
can
this
last
years
and
keep
up
with
this
i
dont
know
but
its
fucking
awesome
right
now
thanks
dan
for
sharing
the
other
night
poured
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
big
boozy
aromas
malt
oak
bourbon
and
caramel
on
the
palate
this
one
was
full
bodied
and
went
down
entirely
too
easy
for
10
flavors
of
oak
sweet
malt
bourbon
and
caramel
appearance
was
pleasant
nice
burgundy
brown
color
aroma
is
sweet
and
of
toffee
caramel
taste
was
of
vanilla
coconut
and
sweet
pang
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
exceptional
with
a
sweetness
from
the
alcohol
and
barrel
aging
along
with
a
nice
oily
texture
that
went
wonderfully
with
the
paired
caramel
apple
cheescake
i
had
with
it
overall
very
impressive
shared
a
bomber
of
this
saturday
night
poured
a
brownish
color
with
a
small
head
aromas
of
toffee
caramel
and
booze
taste
was
wonderful
vanilla
caramel
toffee
and
a
little
heat
from
the
higher
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
just
about
perfect
lightly
carbonated
very
smooth
across
the
tongue
and
no
bitterness
at
the
end
this
one
is
a
great
job
by
dry
dock
i
will
have
to
seek
out
more
of
this
o
if
i
lived
in
colorado
i
would
have
bought
a
case
of
this
when
it
was
released
hell
i
dont
live
in
colorado
and
will
do
my
best
to
acquire
one
anyway
this
is
a
great
barrelaged
barleywine
i
honestly
liked
this
better
than
moas
and
abacus
cant
speak
to
others
yet
seek
this
out
if
you
can
great
job
dry
dock
you
should
be
proud
of
this
one
this
beer
is
very
satisfying
dry
dock
did
an
excellent
job
of
capturing
the
best
qualities
that
the
barrels
had
to
offer
the
balance
and
thick
layers
of
flavors
and
smells
makes
this
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
that
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
o
perhaps
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
all
year
by
far
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
usually
not
a
fan
of
the
style
this
offering
from
dry
dock
is
truly
supreme
with
only
1200
bottles
of
this
and
stranahans
discontinuing
their
offerings
of
barrels
to
anyone
but
breckenridge
despite
my
potential
homerism
i
think
any
bourbon
bal
fan
andor
barleywine
fan
needs
to
try
this
beer
alright
the
price
19
00
per
bomber
really
made
me
think
twice
about
this
purchase
but
the
fact
the
there
was
only
one
on
the
shelf
and
it
came
highly
regarded
sealed
the
deal
cant
say
i
regret
it
this
one
poured
a
deep
caramel
auburn
color
into
a
wine
glass
with
a
very
thin
but
persistent
little
head
holy
cow
the
nose
this
one
smells
of
bourbon
whiskey
oak
and
alcohol
also
coconut
in
the
nose
like
the
label
says
but
not
coconut
from
a
tree
more
like
a
can
of
coconut
milk
which
is
entirely
pleasant
and
subtle
mmm
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavy
and
sweet
almost
like
a
real
nice
dubbel
complex
and
malty
the
alcohol
is
all
smoothed
out
with
a
thoroughly
robust
whiskey
finish
certainly
imparted
from
the
barrel
aging
process
a
big
time
beer
warming
from
the
inside
out
heavy
heavy
buzz
after
a
bomber
really
nice
on
an
early
autumn
night
if
any
volume
of
beer
can
be
so
pricey
and
worth
it
it
surely
is
dry
dock
blighs
not
for
everyone
but
impeccably
well
done
update
had
this
again
last
night
it
is
really
coming
along
nicely
8
months
has
helped
smooth
this
beer
out
and
it
is
now
magical
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
should
be
in
12
ounce
bottles
rather
than
just
bombers
12
ounces
is
just
right
and
its
silly
to
force
people
to
open
more
at
one
time
if
im
with
friends
and
sharing
i
can
easily
just
open
a
second
12
ounce
bottle
but
if
drinking
by
myself
id
love
to
just
drink
a
12
ounce
bottle
on
a
week
night
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
pours
to
a
deep
mahogany
brown
body
head
is
biscuity
khaki
in
color
the
nose
is
very
odd
but
attractive
the
first
thought
that
comes
to
mind
is
a
fresh
opened
box
of
cheeseit
crackers
i
know
this
sounds
off
putting
but
it
is
very
inviting
and
really
makes
you
anticipate
the
first
sip
the
flavor
is
big
and
bold
with
tons
of
cracker
like
toasted
grain
tones
the
hops
that
are
usually
so
prevalent
in
a
barley
wine
ale
play
only
as
a
balancer
here
rich
and
spicy
on
the
palate
and
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
old
ale
i
had
this
beer
on
my
wants
list
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
enjoy
this
spectacular
brew
o
very
nice
barleywine
maybe
one
day
i
will
get
a
chance
to
try
moas
but
this
was
a
solid
brew
o
great
big
barleywine
solid
strong
its
a
sipper
will
buy
again
there
may
not
be
enough
deprivation
in
our
lives
to
properly
enjoy
this
properly
imagine
the
old
sods
slogging
down
the
muddy
lane
to
the
drafty
pub
who
would
have
thanked
god
for
this
one
while
the
smell
of
damp
woolens
wafted
from
the
smoky
fireplace
from
the
22
oz
bottle
o
i
am
a
big
fan
of
english
style
barley
wines
this
one
could
have
used
a
little
more
integration
of
the
flavors
it
was
good
to
try
but
will
not
be
repeated
an
extremely
well
done
english
barleywine
its
been
a
long
time
sense
ive
visited
this
one
and
it
definitely
motivates
me
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
overall
this
is
a
bold
and
extremely
flavorful
sipper
meant
to
be
enjoyed
at
a
slow
pace
and
in
moderation
this
is
one
hell

before
but
this
beer
is
pretty
fantastic
with
4
years
on
it
awesome
in
its
stature
alone
somewhat
onedimensional
owing
to
the
minimal
sweeteness
never
thought
id
be
wishing
for
a
barleywine
to
be
sweeter
absolutely
tremendous
berry
profile
blackberry
blueberry
marionberry
boysenberry
and
lingonberry
theres
also
some
fig
raisin
rhubarb
and
a
reasonably
hefty
helping
of
very
floral
hops
to
dry
out
the
finish
the
body
is
slightly
syrupy
but
not
overly
so
i
like
this
even
more
than
mother
of
all
storms
overall
probably
one
of
the
best
most
intense
nonbarrelaged
english
barleywines
ive
had
yet
and
it
gives
some
of
those
a
run
for
their
money
as
well
outstanding
pours
a
dark
amber
and
mahogany
color
capped
with
light
brown
foam
aroma
is
a
mix
of
molasses
black
cherry
raisins
and
tobacco
the
flavor
starts
with
a
hefty
dose
of
brown
sugar
toffee
and
cherry
liqueur
followed
by
some
date
plum
and
grape
juice
notes
there
is
some
chocolate
fig
and
currant
in
the
background
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
soft
carbonation
and
more
malt
and
booze
in
the
finish
overall
a
sweet
and
potent
englishstyle
barleywine
with
a
unique
blend
of
dark
fruit
and
malt
flavors
want
more
of
this
especially
on
a
cold
winter
day
o
14
for
this
beer
i
was
dooped
overall
i
have
had
much
better
barleywines
in
my
lifetime
but
this
one
isnt
bad
it
doesnt
try
to
achieve
too
much
and
remains
a
solidly
good
beer
i
would
give
it
a
b
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
brown
sugar
and
toffee
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
chocolate
light
earthy
herbal
aroma
rounds
out
the
nose
nicely
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
sugary
malts
hints
of
cherry
and
toffee
with
some
light
earth
and
smoke
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
hard
to
believe
this
is
13
but
maybe
the
barrel
aged
stouts
before
this
numbed
my
palette
a
bit
nice
english
style
barleywine
that
id
like
to
revisit
one
day
o
an
incredible
rich
barleywine
that
impressed
it
was
interesting
to
have
this
to
after
moas
which
definitely
adds
another
component
with
the
barrel
overall
the
parts
of
this
beer
that
i
liked
i
really
liked
but
the
oddly
sourbitter
flavor
was
off
putting
the
beer
is
also
much
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
especially
for
the
style
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
im
a
fan
of
english
barleywines
especially
when
aged
a
couple
years
so
this
should
have
been
pretty
good
unless
they
screwed
it
up
and
they
didnt
lots
of
malts
that
are
nice
mostly
toffee
and
nutty
flavors
nice
caramel
and
toasted
malts
as
well
and
a
molasses
and
biscotti
like
flavors
in
there
too
nice
light
bitterness
mostly
on
the
back
end
and
soft
aged
malts
booze
is
hidden
fairly
well
and
it
will
get
me
buzzed
quickly
chad
one
of
my
absolutely
favorite
non
barrelaged
barleywines
a
good
malty
barleywine
though
the
sweetness
is
high
enough
that
its
on
the
downslope
less
would
be
better
more
would
definitely
be
worse
overall
an
english
barleywine
for
the
sipping
worth
a
try
if
you
stumble
across
it
overall
im
actually
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
i
welcome
it
most
of
the
times
barleywines
are
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
this
one
was
good
i
enjoyed
it
wish
it
looked
more
appealing
though
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
carameltoffee
and
some
slight
hop
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
medium
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
but
i
prefer
mother
of
all
storms
over
this
one
edit
2007
vintage
consumed
jan
2013
definitely
tasting
its
age
very
drinkable
but
past
its
prime
overall
a
really
nice
barleywine
in
terms
of
flavor
just
the
finish
that
makes
it
a
bit
harsh
ive
been
waiting
to
drink
this
before
i
tried
moas
if
a
bit
of
barreling
can
chip
away
at
that
finish
i
would
be
most
pleased
overall
very
boozy
very
sweet
even
after
this
long
it
is
too
much
for
me
still
too
hot
and
syrupy
3
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
very
dark
red
brown
amber
almost
black
no
head
and
light
carbonation
aroma
of
sweet
and
caramel
malt
faint
dark
fruits
fortunately
the
flavor
is
richer
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
malt
dark
fruits
finishes
somewhat
dry
and
quickly
with
a
bit
of
a
hops
kick
medium
body
with
some
creaminess
the
high
abv
makes
it
a
bit
hot
a
satisfactory
engilsh
barleywine
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
detracts
from
the
drinking
experience
other
reviews
seem
to
have
good
carbonation
so
ill
try
this
again
overall
nice
mouthfeel
but
im
not
really
digging
the
flavor
cheers
having
had
moas
this
summer
im
not
sure
which
i
prefer
because
i
found
the
bourbon
note
in
moas
to
overpower
the
majority
of
the
base
beer
but
i
dont
recall
it
having
the
medicinal
finish
that
stormwatchers
does
one
finger
brown
head
quick
dissipation
with
absolutely
no
lacing
over
dark
brown
body
with
small
trails
of
small
bubbles
visible
rising
up
near
sides
of
glass
nose
is
really
sweet
some
caramel
malt
and
floral
and
woody
hops
taste
mirrors
the
noses
sweetness
cloying
soy
sauce
turbinado
woody
hop
character
mouthfeel
medium
sticky
good
effervescence
not
my
cup
of
err
tea
the
sweetness
overwhelmed
any
nuances
this
beer
might
have
had
o
a
good
beer
i
suspect
the
age
has
smoothed
it
out
a
little
bit
as
this
was
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
o
really
nice
with
the
age
on
this
one
the
booze
is
super
smooth
and
the
sweetness
is
not
overdone
this
is
the
reason
why
moas
is
such
a
great
beer
the
age
adds
another
dimension
one
of
the
best
domestic
examples
of
the
style
happy
to
sample
this
first
before
cracking
one
of
barrel
aged
versions
perfectly
suited
for
the
environment
it
was
produced
in
takes
me
right
back
to
the
oregon
coast
o
nowhere
near
as
good
as
perfect
storm
but
not
many
barleywines
are
o
very
nicely
done
barleywine
i
can
definitely
see
this
being
a
great
base
for
mother
of
all
storms
which
i
want
to
try
another
great
job
by
pelican
pub
awesome
work
folks
overall
a
top
top
notch
english
style
barleywine
i
had
really
really
high
expectations
for
this
based
on
this
being
the
backbone
for
their
barrelaged
mother
of
all
storms
so
i
was
mildly
disappointed
by
the
outcome
it
was
very
very
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
for
a
4
year
old
barleywine
their
is
still
some
alcohol
heat
which
is
surprising
but
i
guess
it
is
13
abv
and
although
the
flavor
profile
is
very
good
its
not
mindblowing
or
complex
really
just
caramel
and
toffee
with
no
supporting
dark
fruitiness
maybe
it
is
deteriorating
as
well
unfortunately
i
am
going
to
compare
this
and
all
barleywines
going
forward
to
the
arctic
devil
that
i
had
a
couple
weeks
back
i
can
see
how
this
will
be
a
good
canvas
for
the
maos
that
i
have
yet
to
sample
but
i
have
a
couple
cellaring
ive
wanted
to
try
this
since
having
its
big
brother
mother
of
all
storms
its
definitely
a
bit
more
harsh
on
the
palate
than
moas
but
still
good
d
what
a
great
barleywine
rich
and
sweet
without
being
too
cloying
thick
or
boozy
really
a
great
profile
for
the
style
i
can
definitely
see
how
this
becomes
mother
of
all
storms
possibly
the
greatest
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
overall
a
smooth
very
drinkable
nicely
balanced
barleywine
d
its
a
sipper
but
a
good
one
looking
forward
to
cracking
my
2007
bottle
sometime
with
the
wife
as
this
is
her
favorite
style
worth
seeking
out
if
you
love
the
perfect
storm
d
best
barleywine
i
have
had
hands
down
thanks
evan
pelican
is
no
joke
and
they
know
what
they
are
delivering
to
those
that
seek
out
their
beers
great
job
from
one
of
the
few
lucky
bastards
in
indiana
who
actually
may
get
to
try
this
beer
have
a
perfect
storm
waiting
also
2008
sexy
ruby
with
low
low
carb
raisins
caramel
toffee
earthen
pots
and
alcohol
wisp
into
the
air
big
maltiness
big
sexiness
and
im
gonna
steal
from
the
review
below
me
but
the
alcohol
kick
is
certainly
reminiscent
of
a
high
quality
smooth
rum
its
damn
good
viscous
chewy
this
is
how
life
begins
with
moments
like
these
tasty
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
will
hold
up
in
the
cellar
as
well
as
its
big
brother
the
perfect
storm
the
malt
is
on
the
edge
of
oxidation
and
there
are
zero
hops
throughout
the
bottle
to
help
it
along
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
drank
it
is
no
surprise
that
this
holds
up
so
well
to
barrel
aging
and
morphs
into
the
perfect
storm
2009
vintage
having
recently
had
east
end
gratitude
this
beer
is
in
for
a
difficult
challenge
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
and
smells
almost
as
good
again
that
characteristic
toffee
caramel
flavor
coupled
with
a
bit
of
booze
pelicans
offering
brings
that
flavor
but
in
a
bit
more
muddled
fashion
there
is
also
some
slightly
unpleasant
booziness
slight
i
am
enjoying
it
and
would
probably
like
it
more
if
i
didnt
just
have
the
knockout
of
the
style
in
gratitude
great
barleywine
overall
had
this
sidebyside
with
perfect
storm

and
it
was
tough
to
pick
a
winner

drinkability
this
is
no
perfect
storm
in
name
or
in
flavor
i
think
part
of
thats
in
my
head
what
with
the
increased
harshnessbitterness
from
the
alcohol
but
also
from
the
lack
of
balance
that
the
barrel
aging
contributes
regardless
im
still
pretty
impressed
by
this
beer
its
a
wellmade
barleywine
with
tons
of
complexity
and
flavor
with
tons
of
dark
leafy
hop
notes
and
dark
steely
malts
and
with
tons
of
sweeter
fruitier
lighter
notes
this
one
has
the
potential
to
be
beautiful
with
a
year
or
two
of
age
on
it
if
you
got
it
sit
on
it
and
if
you
got
two
sit
on
one
and
send
me
the
other
cheers
drinkability
this
one
is
flavorful
but
meant
to
be
sipped
too
much
and
it
fatigues
very
quickly
i
didnt
know
the
alc
when
we
drank
it
and
im
not
surprised
its
listed
at
13
3
another
bottle
shared
by
presario
at
hosers
british
open
sunday
tasting
overall
its
heavy
super
sweet
sticky
and
a
mess
its
really
not
that
good
and
id
take
a
real
barleywine
over
this
molasses
and
honey
mess
any
day
i
honestly
cant
see
and
taste
what
people
are
thinking
here
with
this
brew
drinkability
really
drinking
nicely
now
with
great
balance
between
the
elements
d
sure
the
alcohol
heat
is
evident
bah
so
what
its
a
straightup
delicious
barleywine
that
requires
plenty
of
time
to
sip
and
someone
to
enjoy
it
with
could
stand
a
little
more
time
in
the
cellar
to
fully
calm
down
still
its
damn
fine
right
now
similar
to
anchor
old
foghorn
but
slightly
richer
all
of
these
were
individually
excellent
and
it
was
amazing
luck
to
be
able
to
have
this
on
tap
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
such
a
small
town
brewery
im
a
sucker
for
a
great
english
barleywine
and
thats
exactly
what
this
is
the
sweetness
is
dominant
but
with
a
hop
profile
that
makes
things
more
complex
and
a
completely
massive
mouthfeel
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
mouthfeel
is
heavy
dense
and
oily
with
a
big
bite
adding
to
the
bittersweet
flavor
wonderful
drinkability
not
a
bad
barleywine
but
not
really
english
style
imo
worth
trying
though
interesting
mix
of
flavors
the
beer
is
full
bodied
with
lowmedium
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
a
quality
english
barleywine
overall
impression
big
english
barleywine
that
seems
like
it
could
hold
up
for
a
long
time
in
the
cellar
could
be
great
in
a
few
years
id
have
this
again
if
i
aged
it
a
few
years
and
id
split
it
with
a
friend
this
was
a
2006
bottle
from
my
cellar
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
a
medium
head
the
beer
smells
like
thomas
hardy
with
all
the
old
fruit
and
burnt
sugar
this
is
a
splendid
barley
wine
with
all
the
big
evolved
mouthfeel
23
years
in
the
cellar
seem
to
transform
the
beer
from
young
hoppy
and
sweetish
to
dry
and
rounded
as
with
all
pelican
beers
this
is
very
drinkable
and
balanced
to
a
t
2006
vintage
pours
a
slightly
ruddy
brown
some
haziness
and
a
decent
sized
butterscotch
yellow
head
that
slowly
recedes

rollup
a

blends
with
the

mouthfeel
is
medium

heavy
creamy
and
chewy

hint
of

some
warmth
and
a

from

which
is
otherwise
very
well
hidden
delicious
barleywine
drinking
good
at
this
age
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
version
sometime
but
this
beer
seems
though
it
could
easily
go
longer
thank
you
paul
for
the
opportunity
d
i
still
find
the
alcohol
quite
harsh
thank
you
for
bringing
to
our
barleywine
night

entered
on
the
label
big
offwhite
head
with
a
cheese
appearance
and
bubbles
some
lace
seen
the
smell
is
sour
and
barleywine
the
taste
is
considerably
on
the
sour
side
it
is
intentional
primarily
it
tastes
like
an
average
barleywine
somewhat
disapointing
for
a
barleywine
with
some
ageing
mt
hood
hops

ibu
d
this
was
very
close
to
being
an
outstanding
barleywine
without
that
lingering
charred
flavor
this
would
have
been
world
class
as
it
was
though
i
did
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
2006
vintage
bought
from
john
grocery
in
portland
a
while
ago
doesnt
look
like
much
poursa
hazy
dark
brown
with
little
head
from
there
it
gets
much
better
lovely
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
spice
sassafras
some
roastiness
and
sweet
nice
the
taste
has
similar
components
but
there
is
also
quite
a
bit
of
herbal
tang
more
spice
and
a
good
deal
of
sweet
malt
but
all
with
a
very
bitter
citrus
and
pine
hop
finish
all
big
flavors
but
they
balance
each
other
rather
than
conflict
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sharp
and
full
huge
and
spicy
and
very
high
alcohol
make
this
one
a
sipper

edit
stopped
by
again
today
and
was
able
to
taste
the
2004
through
2009
side
by
side
along
with
the
2009
perfect
storm
while
all
were
excellent
and
once
again
the
2005
was
the
standout
all
of
these
beers
were
quite
different
as
well
so
i
think
its
kind
of
sad
that
this
beer
is
not
entered
into
the
data
base
by
vintage
as
each
vintage
was
noticeably
different
in
any
event
regardless
of
the
vintage
winterstorm
is
an
excellent
beer
one
worth
sampling
and
enjoying
the
winter
storm
flight
at
10
for
5
beers
was
an
especially
good
value
imho
not
exactly
something
pelican
brewing
is
known
for
definitely
try
the
flight
if
you
happen
to
have
the
chance
drinkability
is
very
good
its
not
an
overwhelming
powerhouse
of
flavor
but
the
subtle
warm
flavors
make
this
a
very
nice
barleywine
to
sip
this
tastes
more
like
a
english
barleywine
to
me
wow
caught
me
a
little
offguard
there
on
my
first
sip
thinking
it
was
just
another
winter
type
ale
that
turned
into
a
barleywine
ale
this
2006
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
that
you
can
tell
has
some
viscosity
to
it
that
carries
a
thin
head
smell
is
rich
in
malt
honey
liqueur
dark
fruits
and
alchohol
taste
is
what
is
expected
from
a
barleywine
big
and
bold
with
a
good
alchohol
bite
with
a
thick
and
rich
mouthfeel
now
that
my
palate
is
in
tune
to
what
i
am
really
tasting
and
letting
it
warm
a
bit
i
can
get
the
true
style
of
this
beer
and
really
appreciate
its
warming
effect
on
par
with
most
of
the
pelican
beers
ive
tried
most
of
them
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
and
that
means
its
a
superb
bit
of
craftsmanship
its
survived
a
year
in
the
bottle
quite
well
could
use
even
more
aging
no
doubt
so
im
sipping
this
on
a
brisk
sunny
beautiful
autumn
afternoon
with
nothing
but
falls
colors
around
and
im
wishing
i
were
standing
on
the
beach
in
a
mighty
wind
watching
a
storm
off
the
pacific
coast
in
pacific
city
it
happens
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
without
travelling
crosscountry
to
get
it
vintage
2006
poured
from
the
bomber
into
two
pint
glasses
dark
ruby
red
in
color
with
muted
carbonation
and
lace
the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
caramel
malt
molasses
cherry
and
hops
the
taste
is
huge
this
stuff
could
probably
sit
another
six
months
or
a
year
or
more
flavors
follow
the
aroma
perfectly
except
for
a
substantial
but
reasonable
alcohol
bite
on
the
end
very
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
and
would
likely
soften
and
get
even
fuller
with
time
one
of
the
best
american
barley
wines
ive
had
pours
a
very
dark
burgundymahogany
color
with
an
adequate
roasted
marshmallow
head
that
recedes
steadily
while
leaving
zero
lacing
and
yes
this
glass
is
beer
clean
the
yulesmith
i
just
drank
out
of
one
of
its
kin
left
a
nice
thick
layer
anyway
the
aroma
is
malty
kinda
bready
and
nutty
at
the
same
time
the
taste
reveals
more
depth
i
get
hints
of
caramel
alcohol
butterscotch
various
nuts
fig
and
other
flavors
im
unable
to
identify
upon
warming
the
alcohol
really
comes
out
first
sip
was
at
proper
serving
temp
but
the
alcohol
was
almost
nonexistent
i
wondered
if
this
was
really
as
big
as
advertised
but
now
i
know
it
definitely
is
i
initially
criticized
the
mouthfeel
for
a
lack
of
carbonation
but
soon
became
aware
of
the
thick
syrupy
body
that
i
love
so
much
with
these
huge
barley
wines
this
is
wellcrafted
and
all
the
components
seem
to
be
enjoying
a
nice
harmony
i
cant
knock
it
it
got
better
with
each
sip
until
i
realized
i
now
need
to
go
purchase
a
few
more
before
the
shelf
is
empty
considering
its
strength
this
brew
is
off
the
charts
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
this
beer
should
be
spectacular
for
years
a
fine
choice
for
my
200th
review
im
really
glad
i
have
another
one
of
these
in
the
stash
i
bet
itll
keep
maturing
for
years
well
see
just
how
patient
i
can
actually
be
really
nice
complex
and
huge
barley
wine
drinkable
but
in
the
long
savoring
way
that
a
great
barley
wine
should
be
very
highly
recommended
need
to
get
more
what
a
pleasant
surprize
to
try
this
on
a
winter
day
in
alaska
sampled
at
the
2003
holiday
ale
festival
portland
or
a
dark
reddish
cider
color
hardlythere
head
lots
of
malts
but
hops
are
there
from
the
beginning
supposedly
this
beer
employed
2
kinds
of
unusual
hopping
techniques
mash
hopping
and
first
wort
hopping
this
creates
a
subtle
yet
indelible
hop
flavor
that
is
there
from
the
very
beginning
some
smokiness
and
a
smooth
noncarbonated
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
in
the
end
its
a
bit
flat
and
cloying
its
taste
explodes
with
a
huge
bananna
and
nut
flavor
with
a
big
alcohol
bite
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
strong
ale
american
style
overall
for
its
age
im
amazed
how
well
it
help
up
nice
and
mellow
but
still
have
some
pronounced
alcohol
in
there
very
good
beer
i
hade
a
three
year
old
one
not
too
bad
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
dissipated
immediately
no
lacing
the
nose
was
so
complex
big
grain
nose
toasted
malt
brown
sugar
and
dried
dark
fruit
plums
raisins
molasses
the
taste
seemed
to
be
falling
apart
for
me
maybe
a
sign
of
the
again
and
reminded
me
mostly
of
overripe
fruits
maybe
even
rotting
a
bit
with
lots
of
plums
brown
bread
dough
molasses
treacle
lots
of
boozy
bourbon
but
smooth
with
almost
no
alcohol
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
fresh
22
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
bottled
on
1232013
pours
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
finger
fairly
dense
tan
head
with
poor
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
ring
pretty
quickly
some
minimal
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
with
a
fair
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
raisin
prune
fig
date
caramel
molasses
toffee
toast
brown
bread
bourbon
oak
light
vanilla
light
tobacco
and
oaktoasted
earthiness
very
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and
complexity
of
darkbready
malt
fruity
yeast
and
oak
barrel
notes
with
good
strength
taste
of
big
caramel
molasses
toffee
toast
brown
bread
raisin
prune
fig
date
bourbon
oak
leather
tobacco
light
vanilla
light
chocolate
and

slight

lingering
notes
of
caramel
toffee
toast
molasses
brown
bread
raisin
prune
fig
date
bourbon
oak
leather
tobacco
and
oaktoasted
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
while
outstanding
complexity
and
balance
of
darkbready
malt
fruity
yeast
and
oak
barrel
flavors
with
zero
cloying
sweetness
present
after
the
finish
light
carbonation
and
full
bodied
with
a
very
creamy
fairly
slick
and
lightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
a
smallmoderate
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
awesome
barrel
aged
english
barelywine
style
all
around
great
complexity
and
balance
of
darkbready
malt
fruity
yeast
and
oak
barrel
flavors
and
fairly
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
huge
abv
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
but
i
feel
that
the
base
beer
is
more
impressive
than
this
one
overall
this
is
quite
an
impressive
beer
i
quite
honestly
cannot
remember
the
last
time
that
i
have
enjoyed
a
beer
this
much
this
is
a
very
complex
and
killer
brew
you
really
have
to
sit
down
sip
and
savor
this
one
with
a
14
bill
sipping
and
relishing
should
probably
be
part
of
the
option
anyway
the
pelican
is
a
heck
of
a
brewery
and
this
is
way
more
than
a
heck
of
a
brew
cant
wait
to
taste
my
other
bottle
in
a
couple
of
years
or
so
and
compare
the
difference
tastes
of
bready
toffeeish
slightly
creamy
malts
with
a
very
clean
mouthfeel
to
it
until
the
bourbon
enters
the
scene
bringing
a
wooden
slightly
dry
alcohol
bite
with
it
as
well
as
a
vanilla
note
mingling
with
molasses
nougat
and
stale
oakie
coffee
the
boozy
bourbon
bite
is
teeth
numbing
dominant
while
getting
toned
down
by
glazed
toffee
and
honey
building
up
a
great
balance
between
wooden
booziness
and
caramelized
sweetness
due
to
the
surprisingly
convenient
balance
there
are
many
subtle
flavors
detectable
such
as
an
acrid
coffee
tang
resulting
from
the
rich
bourbon
paired
against
toasty
glazed
vanilla
getting
accompanied
by
hazelnuts
has
a
hot
dryness
to
it
during
the
finish
enveloping
the
dried
fruits
sweet
malts
with
molasses
providing
a
long
lasting
aftertaste
among
the
leathery
wooden
bourbon
2014
vintage
poured
into
snifter
no
head
at
all
smells
of
dark
fruits
dipped
in
bourbon
more
of
a
bourbon
than
a
beer
too
boozy
for
my
taste
had
to
drain
pour
half
the
bottle
but
still
a
world
class
beer
i
wish
it
had
just
a
tad
bit
more
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
wasnt
as
apparent
2012
vintage
never
tried
fresh
but
this
is
still
pretty
boozy
which
i
dont
normally
mind
still
very
good
id
love
to
try
a
12
or
13
of
this
or
try
a
14
in
a
few
years
now
its
slightly
too
hot
and
needs
a
bit
of
time
to
mellow
out
however
even
at
this
stage
its
still
delicious
and
clearly
wellcrafted
an
incredible
balance
of
malts
and
oak
barrels
i
could
curl
up
with
this
on
a
cold
night
and
be
happy
all
night
i
have
always
loved
this
and
just
a
treat
to
drink
again
o
i
appreciate
this
beer
for
its
bold
qualities
throughout
i
am
not
a
barleywine
guy
but
i
love
bourbon
this
delivers
the
best
of
the
beer
and
bourbon
world
making
a
barleywine
that
i
find
highly
drinkable
this
beer
is
just
a
tad
too
sweet
the
beer
was
way
to
sweet
smelled
of
dried
dog
food
and
didnt
taste
much
better
perhaps
im
missing
something
here
or
i
had
a
bad
bottle
nevertheless
i
certainly
prefer
others
thick
meaty
sweet
delicious
perfect
barleywine
waaaaaay
better
than
expected
when
ordered
on
draft
at
belmont
station
thanks
to
brian
for
the
tasting
this
beer
is
exceptional
from
its
dark
color
and
perfectly
sweet
aroma
to
its
complex
flavor
profile
and
balanced
finish
it
is
a
winner
i
look
forward
to
many
more
opportunities
to
sample
the
mother
of
all
storms
o
a
good
barley
wine
but
one
that
is
heavy
on
the
hops
i
would
give
it
a
higher
score
were
it
more
balanced
consumed
fresh
on
release
in
2013
and
2014
im
waiting
to
see
how
the
2013
will
be
with
some
more
age
on
it
more
like
an
old
ale
along
the
lines
of
hotd
adam
except
bigger
tastier
and
more
complex
with
the
bba
and
a
nice
dry
finish
takes
the
best
of
stout
characteristics
fruityness
of
a
barleywine
and
oxidized
characteristic
of
a
barrel
aged
old
ale
evaporates
on
the
tun
full
review
to
follow
mother
of
all
storms
is
a
top
tier
barrel
aged
english
barleywine
this
one
is
well
worth
a
huntchase
very
glad
that
i
procurred
multiples
nietzscheshorse
really
nails
it
a
dessert
beer
if
ever
there
was
one
this
beer
is
so
intensely
sweet
that
it
teeters
between
being
undrinkably
sweet
and
thoroughly
delicious
sipper
sipper
sipper
more
perhaps
than
any
other
beer
ive
yet
tried
this
one
manages
to
walk
the
fine
line
between
being
utterly
undrinkable
on
account
mostly
of
its
intense
sweetness
and
being
utterly
delicious
on
account
of
its
rich
malty
flavors
a
memorable
offering
but
if
you
have
it
in
a
bottle
plan
on
sharing
that
bottle
one
or
two
ways
if
you
can
i
think
the
shining
aspect
of
this
beer
is
how
easy
it
drinks
beguilingly
smooth
i
have
to
say
i
think
my
local
marble
barleywine
gives
this
a
run
for
its
money
either
way
i
look
forward
to
aging
a
couple
for
future
consumption
dark
reddishblack
head
quickly
faded
to
a
ring
smells
of
molasses
vanilla
oak
and
a
little
boozy
tastes
how
i
anticipated
from
the
smell
but
better
same
flavors
as
in
the
aroma
with
some
dark
dried
fruits
in
there
as
well
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
exceptionally
smooth
hides
its
alcohol
well
though
clearly
a
sipper
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
then
some
im
more
of
an
ipa
guy
but
i
just
had
the
2014
mother
of
all
storms
on
its
first
day
released
really
good
smooth
full
of
flavor
strong
wo
tasting
too
strong
good
beer
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
though
it
looses
points
in
my
mind
for
the
texture
its
too
viscous
for
me
though
i
understand
developing
this
sort
of
flavor
profile
has
its
drawbacks
i
cant
imagine
how
much
grain
went
into
making
this
this
was
an
absolute
standout
at
last
nights
beer
share
and
as
a
result
i
still
vividly
remember
the
flavour
the
next
morning
it
is
full
of
toasted
coconut
and
quite
a
bit
of
roastiness
for
a
bw
and
breaks
to
a
big
salted
toffee
back
end
smell
was
vanilla
coconut
and
general
sweetness
this
was
almost
cloyingly
sweet
but
still
delicious
overall
this
is
a
decidedly
smooth
rich
balanced
wellcrafted
english
barleywine
that
is
perched
atop
the
barleywine
food
chain
it
is
easy
drinking
and
dangerous
i
have
not
had
a
comparable
barleywine
mouthfeel
mediumfull
mouthfeel
appropriate
carbonation
sticky
with
residual
sugars
again
good
overall
this
probably
would
have
been
better
a
year
ago
but
still
has
retained
much
of
its
quality
a
bit
oxidized
but
does
not
affect
the
beer
too
much
overall
i
have
a
2011
that
i
will
open
very
soon
and
hope
it
has
faded
a
bit
less
than
this
oone
of
the
benchmarks
for
the
style
a
great
sipper
which
will
mellow
nicely
over
time
overall
this
is
the
mother
of
all
mothers
of
beer
and
the
anticipation
and
excitement
levels
were
obviously
through
the
roof
contrasting
against
some
of
these
whales
that
may
taste
the
same
as
its
toptiered
brethren
stylistically
this
is
a
sure
standout
for
barleywines
as
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
the
aromas
hit
the
room
from
corner
to
corner
enticing
you
with
every
breath
the
flavoring
is
extremely
pure
and
full
with
absolutely
nothing
offensive
about
it
there
is
almost
no
aftertaste
due
in
part
to
the
thick
coating
of
sugar
left
around
the
mouth
but
more
so
due
to
the
fact
that
the
blend
is
so
utterly
perfected
if
youve
had
westy
12
youll
know
what
we
mean
when
we
say
that
this
should
be
the
basic
prototype
for
the
style
there
are
no
bells
or
whistles
youre
not
expecting
but
rather
you
are
presented
with
something
so
pure
and
unabashed
we
keep
using
the
word
pure
but
there
really
isnt
any
other
way
to
put
it
this
is
one
of
the
most
palpably
slow
drinkers
in
recent
memory
you
dont
want
to
guzzle
or
pound
because
the
flavoring
is
so
amazing
but
rather
you
want
to
finesse
this
one
and
perhaps
take
it
out
for
a
nice
seafood
dinner
by
candlelight
followed
by
a
romantic
ride
in
a
horsedrawn
carriage
oh
yes
you
want
this
experience
to
last
forever
really
solid
great
flavour
and
balance
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
viscous
but
heavy
and
domineering
would
be
near
impossible
to
crush
this
one
in
a
solo
op
however
im
tempted
to
try
it
if
i
can
land
another
bottle
to
repeat
a
monstrous
decadent
beastand
one
of
the
finest
barleywines
ive
had
this
is
a
2012
vintage
im
drinking
very
deep
brown
and
when
the
light
hits
it
a
deep
red
garnet
color
created
initially
a
reddish
deep
brown
head
is
formed
and
fades
away
a
thin
ring
remains
around
the
class
not
surprising
given
the
alcohol
content
aroma
is
jammy
with
raisins
alcohol
is
rather
present
even
after
two
years
some
barrel
presence
remains
port
like
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
booze
port
and
sherry
like
flavors
waft
in
and
become
heavy
and
prominant
burnt
caramel
raisins
and
toffee
mingle
with
the
sherry
and
port
flavors
complex
flavor
really
it
is
way
beyond
a
barrel
bomb
slick
oily
mouthfeel
thick
not
cloying
however
the
alcohol
creates
a
sharp
and
clearly
burn
like
quality
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
an
exceptional
ale
downsides
the
alcohol
keeps
coming
back
and
reminding
me
it
is
there
the
burnt
caramel
flavor
is
rather
strong
and
can
be
off
putting
the
palate
is
left
muddy
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
i
still
cant
describe
why
very
good
beer
excited
to
see
what
age
can
do
can
imagine
it
improving
mellowing
out
and
blending
together
time
will
tell
overall
this
was
infinitely
better
than
the
2011
i
had
a
while
back
much
less
alcohol
and
burn
which
allows
the
interesting
flavor
profile
to
come
though
perhaps
some
more
time
in
the
cellar
will
allow
it
to
mellow
out
a
bit
more
and
take
some
of
the
heat
out
of
the
equation
that
and
a
less
prickly
feel
would
make
this
one
a
real
winner
thanks
again
scotto
was
a
pleasure
overall
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
the
first
time
that
4
75
rating
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
sucaba
drinks
rather
well
for
such
a
huge
beer
slighty
onedimensional
perhaps
and
a
tad
too
filling
but
it
makes
for
a
lovely
sipper
definitely
would
buy
and
enjoy
again
mf
very
nice
and
creamy
almost
too
creamy
this
is
so
interesting
so
complex
and
quite
a
delight
dark

hint

spiciness
in

thick

with
no
real
trace
of
heat
i
think
ive
had
more
complex
barleywines
but
few
as
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
a
superb
example
rich
and
complex
drinkable
for
its
abv
they
dont
overdo
it
with
the
barrel
aging
either
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
so
renowned
if
you
have
a
2012
around
drink
it
now
mine
was
already
oxidizing
and
i
think
a
bit
past
its
prime
o
im
not
sure
with
the
whale
factor
plays
a
role
in
the
high
rating
here
but
the
beer
is
overly
sweet
in
nature
which
is
a
huge
turnoff
for
me
d
ok
im
putting
this
on
my
whale
hunt
damn
this
is
good
5
0
also
my
girlfriend
tried
a
sip
and
immediately
told
me
it
smells
like
dog
food
now
when
i
smell
it
i
pick
that
up
too
damn
you
deana
high
b
id
love
to
revisit
this
one
a
few
years
down
the
road
shes
a
big
ass
boozy
sipper
and
if
i
had
a
second
bottle
id
sit
on
it
for
ages
its
a
great
beer
dont
me
wrong
i
just
dont
think
its
built
to
be
drank
fresh
and
by
fresh
i
mean
a
little
over
a
year
old
immense
barleywine
that
is
easier
to
drink
than
the
2011
stormwatchers
that
preceded
it
on
the
evening
but
also
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
would
be
interested
to
see
whether
it
opens
up
with
5
years
of
age
o
some
may
consider
the
malt
hop
alcohol
balance
a
perfect
storm
and
it
is
indeed
impressive
for
a
brew
of
this
strength
personally
i
could
do
with
a
bit
less
alcohol
and
residual
sweetness
and
some
more
american
hops
though
perhaps
i
was
just
expecting
a
more
hopforward
brew
like
most
of
their
lineup
this
is
seriously
good
and
improves
as
it
warms
verdict
an
incredible
barrel
aged
barleywine
from
pelican
pub
and
certainly
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
barrel
aged
beers
a
masterclass
in
complexity
and
balance
not
too
sweet
not
too
roasty
not
too
boozy
everything
in
harmony
this
beer
is
aging
superbly
well
and
is
worthy
of
any
and
all
accolades
this
beer
has
some
hype
and
it
lives
up
to
it
this
is
a
great
great
english
barleywine
this
is
only
a
year
old
and
i
imagine
more
aging
will
only
make
it
more
awesome
this
is
great
this
is
one
hell
of
a
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
layers
of
malt
sweetness
completely
enhanced
by
the
bourbon
barrel
a
ton
of
complexity
well
worth
the
fight
to
track
down
a
big
barrel
character
up
front
with
rich
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
throughout
a
balanced
beer
with
oak
tannins
and
drying
on
the
back
the
14
is
decently
hidden
behind
this
sank
with
nary
a
hush
o
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
want
to
drink
and
not
write
about
i
screwed
that
up
big
time
o
great
beer
the
lack
of
mouthfeel
is
more
than
made
up
with
the
smell
and
taste
very
similar
to
sucaba
but
more
intense
in
taste
and
more
dark
chocolate
flavor
which
i
like
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
ring
on
top
huge
brown
sugary
caramel
malty
aroma
with
lots
of
deep
dark
fruits
and
bits
of
vanilla
coconut
and
wood
sweet
sugary
malt
flavor
with
a
solid
hit
of
alcohol
dark
fruits
caramel
prunes
wood
and
vanilla
are
all
there
in
the
flavor
hints
of
bourbon
oak
and
oak
tannin
round
out
the
flavor
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
ive
had
this
before
and
remember
enjoying
it
a
bit
more
its
a
nice
barleywine
but
i
feel
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
present
and
may
need
a
bit
of
time
to
mellow
out
o
outstanding
love
the
dark
fruits
with
coconut
complex

keep
you

this

delivers
that
a

real
enjoyable
thanks
to
my
cousin
brian
for
this
one
overall
aa
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
it
was
definitely
worth
25
bucks
i
would
purchase
again
will
be
ticked
as
a
4
75
but
slightly
lower
than
that
o
a
nice
bourboncentric
beer
i
think
this
could
use
a
bit
of
age
to
mellow
things
out
a
bit
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
fresh
so
this
is
it
my
personal
white
whale
finally
slain
after
years
of
navigating
the
high
seas
of
the
craft
beer
world
the
great
beast
lies
dormant
in
my
belly
it
possesses
everything
i
hoped
it
would
balanced
flavors
ample
bourbon
readily
noticeable
vanilla
and
all
that
english
barleywine
goodness
that
i
crave
ultimately
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
while
the
ethanol
is
still
slightly
pronounced
in
this
most
recent
batch
im
hopeful
that
it
would
have
mellowed
with
a
bit
more
time
probably
waited
a
bit
too
long
on
this
one
still
pretty
good
but
id
prefer
more
heat
and
less
sweetness
will
be
drinking
any
future
ones
closer
to
fresh
this
is
an
amazing
barleywine
amazing
flavor
and
mouthfeel
this
is
a
must
have
and
it
is
definitely
a
world
class
bbbw
o
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
up
there
with
leon
and
king
henry
i
will
need
to
revisit
sucaba
soon
to
see
where
that
one
stands
skol
not
bad
when
a
sweeter
and
bigger
brew
is
called
for
overall
a
really
nice
barleywine
that
could
probably
stand
another
year
or
two
at
least
to
mellow
that
being
said
its
very

this
is
up
there
with
the
best
havent
had
sucaba
recently
enough
to
say
which
i
prefer
but
this
is
in
the
same
league
among
the
top
barleywines
ive
had
fantastic
served
in
an
oversized
snifter
muddy
garnet
body
light
cream
lace
pungent
aroma
fills
the
room
bourbon
spice
dark

this
is
a
monster
of
a
beer
a
rich
array
of
barrel
influences
dominated
by
bourbon
and
oak
brown
sugar
raisins
dates
syrupy
booze
thick
malt
very
good
i
think
i
favor
central
waters
though
for
the
style
overall
im
impressed
this
is
an
unapologetically
big
bold
beer
o
this
is
big
and
malty
and
ultra
sweet
pretty
much
exactly
what
youd
expect
from
a
14
bourbon
barrel
english
barleywine
wonderful
beer
the
only
real
fault
i
could
find
is
when
the
bourbon
stands
alone
in
the
aftertaste
it
tastes
kinda
like
cheapish
bourbon
im
guessing
evan
williams
like
previous
vintages
regardless
not
nearly
as
hot
as
youd
expect
for
a
fresh
14
barrelaged
barleywine
hell
this
bottle
is
barely
3
months
old
honestly
sucaba
has
nothing
on
this
beer
this
should
be

handily
bottle
poured
a
lightly

dark
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
head
with
good

and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
light
whisky
notes
with
some
brown
sugar
toffee
and
some
pretty
robust
caramelized
malt
notes
taste
is
a
great
mix
between
some
toffee
notes
with
some
brown
sugar
and
caramelized
malt
with
some
whisky
notes
which
kinds
of
round
off
the
rough
edge
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
real
apparent
alcohol
very
well
done
but
i
would
have
like
the
residual
sugar
to
be
more
subtle
which
would
have
provide
more
space
for
the
malt
backbone
to
shine
o
all
i
can
say
is
im
glad
i
have
another
one
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
beer
develops
its
a
damn
fine
barleywine
maybe
the
best
bw
ive
had
to
this
point
its
got
so
many
different
flavors
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
an
awesome

ill
be
working

big
thanks
tojzeilinger
for
opening
this
beast
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
there
was
a
thin
bubbly
head
on
top
that
didnt
last
too
long
the
retention
faded
and
there
really
wasnt
any
lacing
either
but
there
was
some
viscosity
on
the
glass
after
each
sip
the
smell
of
the
beer
wasnt
as
potent
as
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
the
beer
smells
sweet
and
earthy
with
some
subtle
booze
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
sweet
there
is
a
touch
of
maple
in
there
with
some
earthy
peat
but
its
very
hidden
the
bitterness
is
low
just
a
touch
of
it
in
the
finish
but
for
the
most
part
this
beer
is
very
malty
and
for
the
right
reasons
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
its
slick
and
very
mellow
not
much
carbonation
here
but
just
enough
overall
it
was
a
good
brew
holds
up
well
to
the
style
i
found
it
to
be
enjoyable
hot
damn
this
was
an
amazing
brew
2012
vintage
absolutely
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
given
the
pretty
high
abv
wonderful
display
of
flavors
clashing
together
with
an
addicting
sweetness
than
never
becomes
overbearing
well
done
o
one
of
but
no
the
best
barleywine
i
like
king
henry
2010
bourbon
ba
old
guardian
and
abacus
more
but
this
is
one
of
the
elite
barleywines
o
mother
of
all
storms
is
a
quintessential
barrelaged
barleywine
showcasing
exceptional
malt
flavor
and
layers
of
complexity
with
bready
notes
chocolate
nuances
and
bourbon
wamth
sip
gingerly
soaking
in
the
uniqueness
and
depth
of
this
oneofakind
beer
and
share
with
others
for
its
a
heavy
hitter
begging
to
be
split
and
savored
o
i
will
be
honest
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
was
slightly
underwhelmed
by
it
do
not
read
that
as
this
not
being
a
good
beer
it
absolutely
is
i
also
realize
that
my
excessive
expectations
are
not
the
fault
of
the
beer
but
i
feel
like
this
was
just
a
step
below
some
of
the
other
top
barrel
aged
barleywines
e
g
king
henry
bb
monster
29
for
my
palate
at
least
o
fantastic
the
mouth
feel
of
this
could
not
be
any
better
complex
and
the
flavors
are
damn
near
perfectly
blended
with
one
another
will
definitely
hang
on
to
a
few
of
these
for
a
nice
dinner
do
not
age
this
it
was
bad
overall
the
subtle
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
tongue
detracts
from
the
overall
flavor
otherwise
a
very
enjoyable

an

wine
that
will

overall
this
beer
exceeded
my
high
expectations
and
is
an
excellent
version
of
a
ba
barleywine
so
many
flavors
and
they
balance
very
well
together
definitely
a
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
as
it
opens
up
over
time
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
o
overall
nice
barleywine
balanced
and
complex
sweet
brown
sugar
and
caramel
toffee
with
touches
of
molasses
not
sure
id
put
this
up
as
one
of
my
overall
favorites
in
the
style
but
it
is
definitely
a
solid
beer
and
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
a
overall
a
really
decadent
beer
probably
best
for
sharing
which
is
the
way
i
will
go
the
next
time
i
have
a
bottle
overall
impressed
is
an
understatement
this
blew
me
away
this
was
my
white
whale
and
was
finally
able
to
secure
a
bottle
glad
to
enjoy
this
very
special
beer
and
highly
recommend
it
poured
into
a
maudite
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
russet
brown
with
only
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
dissipated
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
there
appears
to
be
active
carbonation
but
the
bubbles
dont
stick
around
classic
english
barleywine
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
dark
fruit
with
nice
bourbon
and
oak
notes
flavor
follows
with
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
bourbon
dark
dried
fruit
a
hint
of
cherry
and
chocolate
finishes
somewhat
dry
with
oak
and
light
hops
medium
bodied
alcohol
is
covered
but
still
hot
and
warming
a
really
nice
english
barleywine
that
was
worth
waiting
for
will
lay
a
few
bottles
away
for
ageing
i
think
this
will
score
even
higher
when
the
alcohol
mellows
and
the
flavors
balance
out
over
time
overall
i
have
had
different
vintages
of
this
beer
from
2010
to
2012
and
all
of
them
have
had
the
same
offputting
aftertaste
its
not
awful
but
it
could
be
so
much
better
not
sure
if
its
a
nutty
malt
or
an
oaky
flavor
but
it
keeps
this
from
being
the
perfect
ba
barleywine
that
said
its
still
incredible
overall
mother
of
all
storms
is
a
fantastic
barrel
aged
barleywine
and
one
i
hope
to
have
again
in
the
future
overall
this
is
my
first
time
have
moas
and
i
wish
i
had
never
read
any
reviews
on
previous
years
its
hard
to
think
this
one
compares
o
very
very
good
beer
wellputtogether
and
the
bourbon
and
oak
dont
overwhelm
the
other
flavors
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
a
nice
beer
for
sure
this
and
sucaba
are
up
there
as
my
favorite
english
barley
wines
i
have
had
luckily
i
have
several
more
bottles
of
this
to
age
and
see
how
it
mellows
out
i
had
this
right
after
trying
blighs
and
they
are
completely
different
this
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
and
has
chocolate
and
bitterdark
fruits
maybe
some
time
really
helps
this
beer
out
but
right
now
i
dont
think
it
is
the
league
of
exceptional
english
barleywines
its
been
quite
a
few
years
since
i
was
an
ardent
fan
of
the
barleywine
style
but
this
one
absolutely
blew
me
away
even
fresh
i
can
only
imagine
what
a
few
years
of
aging
might
achieve
o
glad
this
is
distributed
because
i
definitely
dont
need
more
than
one
and
it
wouldve
bee
a
long
drive
to
pacific
city
to
be
nonplussed
needs
a
ton
more
bourbon
otherwise
it
doesnt
justify
the
cost
increase
over
the
stormwatchers
winterfest
or
even
the
wee
heavy
sigh
2009
seems
so
long
ago
though
this
is
better
than
the
20112010
vintages
when
they
were
fresh
t
opens
with
some
burnt
raisin
skin
and
bourbon
then
leads
into
some
great
flavors
of
vanilla
toffee
butterscotch
toasted
oak
and
a
dry
and
warming
finish
with
a
touch
of
booze
fantastic
young
but
i
definitely
cant
wait
to
try
an
older
bottle
really
soon
o
originally
i
gave
this
a
cut
above
average
i
c
have
changed
my
mind
after
afting
the
first
runs
vintages
and
fresh
i
still
believe
this
beer
is
thin
hot
and
off
balanced
the
tannins
on
this
beer
just
a
killer
for
me
in
no
way
is
this
a
true
to
style
english
bwine
and
i
feel
by
taste
experience
and
bjcp
standards
this
is
a
poor
showing
overall
this
brew
is
doing
quite
well
after
a
year
of
mellowing
out
in
my
wine
cooler
bourbon
heat
is
just
right
compared
to
a
year
ago
definitely
would
recommend
the
splurge
if
you
have
the
cash
fantastic
beer
worthy
of
a
spot
on
the
top
100
thanks
evan
o
i
think
i
much
refer
fresh
abacussucaba
over
this
but
it
was
pretty
solid
too
sweet
for
me
though
cant
wait
to
try
this
next
year
after
its
aged
a
little
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
i
had
anticipated
i
have
traded
away
a
few
and
put
off
the
chance
to
try
this
and
am
finally
trying
it
maybe
i
set
my
hopes
a
little
too
high
some
say
its
better
fresher
amazing
so
many
rich
flavors
without
being
too
cloying
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
this
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
its
nose
contains
caramel
brown
sugar
and
quite
a
bit
of
bourbon
the
smell
is
very
fragrant
but
those
who
enjoy
bourbon
from
time
to
time
it
is
quite
nice
sipping
on
this
and
i
taste
vanilla
toffee
more
bourbon
and
some
oak
and
that
bourbon
really
continues
to
shine
it
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
rich
but
finishes
smooth
a
rich
sweet
texture
lingers
on
your
palate
afterwords
wow
this
was
a
very
tasty
english
barleywine
an
excellent
beer
o
the
alcohol
shows
itself
a
bit
too
much
leaving
a
slight
astringent
bitterness
but
otherwise
this
is
good
an
inspired
and
inspiring
glass
a
truly
top
tier
example
of
the
style
while
any
one
element
might
be
improved
upon
in
theory
doing
so
would
upset
the
balance
of
the
whole
o
ive
had
a
few
pours
from
fresher
bottles
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
a
couple
years
maybe
more
on
this
does
wonders
very
rich
complex
and
smooth
overall
an
amazing
english
barleywine
a
big
big
beer
that
would
be
great
to
share
with
some
friends
on
a
chilly
night
superb
stuff
o
so
as
i
was
drinking
this
i
kept
trying
to
compare
it
to
sucaba
as
thats
the
next
highest
ratedmost
hyped
english
barleywine
ive
had
to
date
and
if
i
remember
right
i
enjoyed
the
first
part
of
sucaba
better
than
the
first
part
of
moas
however
as
i
continued
to
drink
i
drank
whole
bombers
of
each
as
i
like
to
do
that
when
trying
a
beer
for
the
first
timerating
a
beer
moas
seemed
to
grow
on
me
with
every
sip
whereas
sucaba
became
somewhat
cloying
as
i
approached
the
end
of
the
second
glass
from
the
bomber
so
as
far
as
which
one
i
liked
more
well
its
a
really
tough
call
but
i
think
id
lean
towards
moas
i
think
a
combination
of
the
two
with
moass
insane
drinkability
combined
with
more
of
a
bourbon
presence
and
a
thicker
mouthfeel
similar
to
sucaba
would
be
the
perfect
barleywine
maybe
thats
what
king
henry
is
like
that
being
said
this
was
excellent
and
i
will
certainly
seek
it
out
again
m
full
body
somewhat
viscous
light
carbonation
o
a
god
beer
overall
id
like
to
try
it
witb
a
bit
more
age
though
o
excellent
beer
probably
just
behind
kh
in
barley
wines
would
no
doubt
have
again
o
a
good
english
barleywine
personally
i
would
choose
abacus
over
this
even
though
its
rated
higher
might
had
been
a
bad
batch
or
something
it
was
good
but
the
odd
after
taste
killed
it
a
little
o
i
really
like
this
beer
probably
my
favorite
barleywine
i
usually
like
my
barleywines
a
bit
hoppier
but
this
was
my
favorite
so
far
anyway
i
will
do
my
best
to
age
a
few
pours
with
ruby
red
edges
and
head
that
fluffs
up
and
drops
quickly
a
smooth
body
with
some
heat
lots
of
malt
dates
figs
lighter
than
expected
body
minimal
bourbon
notes
nice
though
nothing
super
special
not
worth
the
hype
o
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
between
toffee
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
the
bourbon
is
very
well
integrated
probably
my
favorite
barleywine
definitely
more
balanced
than
most
of
the
style
o
gone
before
i
knew
it
and
was
sad
really
well
done
beer
and
enough
notes
of
the
base
beer
to
keep
it
interesting
even
with
the
very
forward
barrel
notes
alcohol
was
well
hidden
until
the
end
and
it
hit
like
a
hammer
then
again
you
just
need
one
of
these
for
the
night
poured
into
a
westy
chalice
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
very
nice
carbonation
nice
fizzy
almost

dark
tan

with
some
little

slicks
left
behind
the

is

a

the
taste
is

this

to

definitely
the
best
english
bw
finally
im
getting
a
chance
to
try
this
brew
really
enjoying
this
one
thanks
david
o
amazing
right
off
the
shelf
without
any
time
in
the
cellar
at
all
o
drinking
this
next
to
abacus
i
would
have
to
rate
it
just
below
because
of
the
weird
after
taste
if
it
werent
for
that
the
complexity
of
flavor
was
better
king
henry
is
in
a
league
of
his
own
this
was
a
really
good
beer
def
something
i
would
want
to
sip
around
a
campfire
o
a
great
barleywine
that
is
a
definite
sipper
at
13
5
glad
i
got
to
try
and
that
i
have
one
more
bottle
well
im
impressed
not
as
smooth
as
abacus
sucaba
not
as
complex
as
king
henry
and
boozier
than
both
but
should
be
included
in
the
conversation
with
the
best
barleywines
out
there
ill
be
seeking
more
of
these
out
wonder
what
more
age
will
do
o
very
outstanding
beer
for
sure
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
others
but
every
thing
comes
together
so
nice
cost
20
for
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
o
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
lived
up
to
the
hype
while
i
had
this
on
my
list
for
probably
two
years
i
was
actually
very
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
and
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
i
imagine
with
a
few
years
age
on
it
it
would
do
well
and
possibly
lose
some
of
the
sweetness
very
impressed
here
pours
a
cherry
leather
with
a
rim
of
dark
tan
foam
smells
nougat
bourbon
raisins
chocolate
and
chewy
caramel
aromas
of

a
sincerely
exquisite

mmmm
cherry
tawny
sweet
vanilla
cake
rich

and
caramels
goddam
this
is
a
good
beer
full
bodied
for
the
style
with
just
a
hare
more
carb
than
i
prefer
with
a
good
sticky
and
chewy
finish
this
is
a
truly
excellent
beer
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
kh
which
is
a
great
beer
2011
vintage
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
with
a
rubyred
hue
medium
sized
tan
head
with
a
hint
of
red
that
goes
down
slowly
scent
is
outstanding
great
toffee
and
brown
sugar
notes
nice
sweet
bourbon
booze
you
can
definitely
smell
the
barrel
in
this
beer
sweet
oak
and
bourbon
with
some
nice
dark
fruits
toffee
and
vanilla
taste
is
just
as
it
smell
more
complex
than
i
was
expecting
all
the
flavors
in
the
nose
are
present
in
the
taste
and
equally
distributed
except
i
get
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
this
gem
is
not
overly
sweet
nor
is
it
too
hot
and
boozy
well
crafted
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
a
bit
sticky
drinkability
is
high
as
this
is
a
delicious
sipper
overall
i
havent
been
this
impressed
about
a
barrel
aged
bw
since
king
henry
would
love
to
try
these
guys
side
by
side
i
got
plenty
of
love
for
sucaba
but
kh
and
this
are
rightfully
powering
over
it
fantastic
beer
for
me
this
sits
right
behind
king
henry
in
my
favorite
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
list
this
had
so
much
flavor
all
working
so
well
together
balance
is
key
and
this
is
quite
the
achievement
o
there
is
a
nice
complexity
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
but
there
is
a
heavy
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
presence
this
beer
is
a
definite
sipping
beer
and
a
very
nice
one
at
that
glad
to
try
this
and
hope
to
get
another
vintage
at
some
point
in
the
future
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
might
make
it
out
to
be
its
a
good
dessert
beer
a
definite
sipper
the
aroma
and
flavors
were
above
average
by
far
very
good
beer
o
i
remember
when
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
it
was
a
2009
bottle
consumed
in
early
2010
and
it
was
the
10
overall
beer
in
the
world
at
the
time
i
thought
that
was
way
too
high
i
have
had
it
twice
since
then
and
it
is
still
very
good
but
the
best
i
have
ever
had
no
way
o
very
delicious
one
of
the
heavier
english
barleywines
out
there
it
was
very
complex
and
the
abv
was
pretty
well
hidden
save
for
a
slight
throat
warming
that
was
more
than
welcome
a
must
try
for
any
english
barleywine
fan
the
2012
is
a
clear
departure
from
previous
vintages
of
moas
and
i
like
what
theyve
done
with
the
place
excited
to
see
how
this
develops
with
age
shared
with
the
wife
in
the
comfort
of
our
home
this
one
was
decanted
into

myself

for

dark

with

maroon
topped
with
a
rocky
beige
head
that
retained
for
a
surprisingly
long
time
and
left
some
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
complex
and
tantalizing
aroma
of
dark
malty
sugars
molasses
juicy
dark
fruits
and
chocolatecovered

in
all
so
i
do
definitely
think
this
is
solid
dvery
solid
beer
good
balance
of
malts
and
a
great
mouthfeel
very
solid
beer
flavor
is
great
but
potent
wow
tons
of
booze
in
this
one
i
would
imagine
with
a
couple
years
this
would
mellow
out
great
a
sipper
in
current
condition
for
me
loads
of
bourbon
big
over
ripe
fruits
like
raisins
and
figs
taste
overall
is
very
sweet
with
a
strong
sharpness
due
to
the
13
5
abv
medium
to
full
body
low
carbonation
heat
from
the
abv
which
is
noticable
on
the
lips
too
after
each
sip
a
great
beer
and
definitely
stoked
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
d
ive
had
2
glasses
and
although
i
would
like
to
drink
more
at
13
50
i
probably
shouldnt
poured
a
dark
brown
with
mahogany
highlights
with
a
thin
head
that
left
good
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
big
caramel
aromas
up
front
with
a
good
amount
of
bourbon
that
also
had
vanilla
accents
and
slight
oakiness
the
flavor
was
big
on
the
caramel
as
well
with
vanilla
accents
and
large
bourbon
notes
busting
through
that
made
the
taste
a
little
heavier
alongside
slight
oak
and
raisins
the
beer
was
full
bodied
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
swet
silky
boozy
finish
very
good
barleywine
and
was
very
happy
to
try
out
at
least
once
the
drinkability
was
pretty
good
considering
the
abv
on
the
brew
rich
deep
dark
mahogany
brown
with
zero
head
some
carbonation
is
seeping
through
this
beer
just
looks
boozy
and
mean
well
sht
another
over
the
top
bourbon
mess
in
the
aroma
sweet
bourbon
molasses
brown
sugar
boozy
soaked
prune
and
dates
the
flavor
delivers
a
tad
more
wow
one
boozy
beer
beer
the
alcohol
is
far
from
hidden
starts
with
a
great
in
depth
complex
barleywine
style
and
is
followed
by
some
bourbon
integration
but
the
finish
is
just
so
sweet
and
hot
my
belly
is
just
filled
with
alcohol
i
can
see
how
many
people
would
love
this
beer
but
its
far
from
being
a
finessful
drinkable
beer
d
fantastic
for
the
style
it
integrates
the
alcohol
very
well
with
the
varieties
of
flavour
the
carbonation
is
very
accommodating
as
well
a
storm
i
would
gladly
weather
when
reaching
for
a
big
brew
such
as
this
delicious
overall
im
glad
im
sharing
this
one
its
super
heavy
and
i
would
not
be
able
to
drink
alot
tasty
though
drinkability
this
is
one
you
want
to
share
but
it
really
blends
all
the
flavor
elements
together
in
a
much
more
subtle
fashion
than
most
other
bourbon
barrel
beers
pours
dark
brown
with
moderate
head
in
a
word
well
integrated
bourbon
this
is
a
knochout
punch
of
dangerously
seductive
alcohol
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
bourbon
but
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
some
coconut
from
the
barraling
the
english
barlewyine
takes
a
secondary
role
to
the
bolder
bourbon
thanks
augustgarage
overall
im
very
happy
to
have
gotten
the
chance
to
try
this
amazing
barleywine
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
very
much
worth
the
darkness
i
gave
up
to
get
it
in
trade
full
bodied
rich
creamy
with
a
surprisingly
high
amount
of
carbonation
at
the
very
least
the
carbonation
is
higher
than
i
expected
it
to
be
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
barleywine
which
i
am
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
d
moderate
but
ohsotasty
i
am
really
impressed
this
is
deserved
of
all
its
praise
a
worldclass
barleywine
im
not
the
biggest
balaged
advocate
but
when
done
this
well
its
a
nobrainer
i
like
my
beers
hot
if
done
well
and
this
one
is
perfection
awesome
stuff
drinkability
boozy
mess
didnt
notice
bourbon
too
sweet
and
too
much
oak
i
dont
get
what
i
am
missing
that
makes
others
like
this
one
so
this
luscious
brew
was
served
up
by
none
other
than
gillard
thanks
ryan
pours
clear
deep

the
aroma
is
full
of
dark
fruitiness
heading
into
solid
boozy
nose
searing
heat
at
the
end
of
the
draw
the
taste
is
smooth
and
sweet
with
prunes
ripe
plums
and
raisins
by
midway
solid
heat
like
booze
tries
to
take
over
the
flavor
right
into
the
finish
very
nice
stuff
that
could
use
a
few
years
of
aging
to
bring
it
into
perfection
a
real
sipper
and
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
again
big
props
to
duane
for
the
opportunity
but
this
didnt
meet
the
hype
thank
you
grant
o
this
beer
is
huge
lots
of
flavor
through
all
its
complexities
the
alcohol
is
just
enough
to
be
noticed
and
not
too
much
to
be
overpowering
a
10oz
pour
out
me
back
defiantly
a
beer
to
share
will
be
seeking
out
more
this
is
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
good
sipping
beer
everything
is
there
not
too
boozy
to
have
this
be
a
memorable
experience
from
an
event
like
dld
says
a
lot
well
done
kudos
pelican
ill
still
be
savoring
this
two
hours
from
now
no
doubt
a
slowsipper
one
to
be
taken
slowly
and
respectfully
simply
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
im
far
from
a
bourbon
aficionado
i
was
hoping
the
bourbon
wouldnt
overtake
what
was
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
and
it
doesnt
and
i
wouldve
easily
believed
this
was
in
the
910
range
judging
by
whats
going
on
in
the
flavor
uh
hey
brian
you
have
10
more
of
these
to
send
my
way
warm
and
almost
too
boozy
but
this
is
one
incredible
smooth
beer
not
harsh
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
would
love
to
have
another
shot
at
this
a
year
or
two
down
the
road
because
this
is
filled
with
potential
a
very
impressive
barleywine
british
style
as
i
prefer
need
to
get
myself
more
of
this
an
excellent
sipper
d
shockingly
drinkable
with
the
high
abv
its
still
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
its
something
you
can
down
easily
all
things
considered
less
almondlike
more
hazelnut
like
with
a
simpler
brown
sugar
toffee
aroma
oxidation
is
starting
to
take
a
hold
here
lending
some
sherry
notes
that
work
well
with
the
nutty
booziness
booze
is
dying
down
bringing
out
the
malt
a
little
bit
more
a
touch
flabby
on
the
finish
solid
stuff
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
from
an
exceptional
brewer
the
deep
roasted
malts
bourbon
and
oak
flavors
come
through
in
every
sip
the
finish
delights
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
this
beer
is
an
absolute
delight
i
strongly
recommend
this
beer
to
all
in
search
of
high
quality
beers
d
while
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
in
its
own
right
i
am
perplexed
that
this
is
a
top
ten
beer
and
at
the
time
of
my
review
the
highest
rated
barleywine
on
ba
i
can
think
of
several
others
that
were
more
enjoyable
some
that
come
to
mind
are
midnight
sun
arctic
devil
cambridge
blunderbus
and
bullfrog
whiskey
ba
old
toad
the
body
is
mediumplus
low
but
peppery
carbonation
this
beer
is
massive
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
it
d
number
10
as
of
right
now
really
give
me
jw
lees
harvest
ale
or
gratitude
any
time
of
this
too
messy
i
just
cant
get
into
it
it
takes
you
to
a
mystical
land
a
dream
world
of
murky
depths
and
heavenly
summits
pours
dark
red
and
a
bit
murky
pungeant
bourbon
vanilla
sweet
malt
caramel
dates
and
figs
its
aroma
is
surpassed
by
the
flavorful
assault
the
sweet
malt
and
bourbon
ride
in
first
flanked
by
vanilla
the
fruit
flavor
and
caramel
then
storm
to
the
sides
capturing
your
entire
match
in
ecstasy
it
finishes
with
just
the
right
bourbon
bite
and
malt
sweetness
leaving
you
desirious
for
more
d
good
but
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
and
ive
drank
many
22s
of
abyss
all
alone
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
to
savor
and
this
is
so
for
two
primary
reasons
1
its
13
5
abv
and
anything
thats
13
5
abv
is
something
to
savor
or
else
youll
end
up
on
your
ass
and
2
theres
too
much
going
on
here
for
even
a
22
oz
bottle
spread
over
3
hours
to
expose
the
drinkability
of
this
one
surely
gets
knocks
for
the
abv
and
also
for
what
is
relatively
speaking
a
pretty
large
amount
of
free
sweetness
but
these
cant
stand
in
the
way
of
what
is
truly
a
remarkably
complex
and
amazing
brew
in
many
ways
this
reminds
me
of
bourbon
barrel
angels
share
boundless
intricacies
in
a
spiritinfused
package
only
with
carbonation
this
ones
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
it
is
a
rare
occasion
that
i
give
a
beer
with
a
13
5
abv
anything
above
a
4
why
is
this
because
i
dont
care
how
well
the
alcohol
is
hidden
for
the
abv
percentage
at
some
point
you
usually
are
still
going
to
be
tasting
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
the
drinkability
will
consequently
be
hampered
quite
a
bit
regardless
of
relative
abv
and
style
considerations
i
make
an
exception
today
for
the
perfect
storm
because
well
the
perfect
storm
is
extremely
drinkable
for
its
abv
with
little
to
no
alcohol
heat
and
on
top
of
that
tastes
delicious
i
want
to
drink
this
one
all
night
and
extremely
glad
to
be
splitting
this
one
with
crellmoset
who
is
almost
certainly
saving
me
from
drinking
to
excess
this
evening
pick
this
up
by
any
means
necessary
as
a
side
note
this
one
pairs
well
with
an
extra
sharp
cheddar
due
to
the
strength
of
the
cheese
but
ive
also
got
some
creamier
cheeses
out
havarti
and
fontina
which
more
than
hold
their
own
with
this
brew
excellent
going
to
hold
on
to
my
last
couple
until
i
know
whether
or
not
i
can
get
more
next
year
thanks
be
to
my
oregon
friend
fred
d
whew
the
alcohol
bit
is
big
but
so
is
the
flavor
drinkability
is
great
nicely
balanced
hiding
much
of
its
13
5
abv
great
depth
excellent
complexity
the
barrel
is
perhaps
a
little
more
heavyhanded
than
i
would
like
but
it
works
pretty
well
wowza
what
a
massive
barleywine
the
barrels
must
have
been
very
wet
for
this
one
loads
of
bourbon
and
very
strong
in
nature
truly
a
boozy
chewy
winter
sipper
if
there
ever
was
one
pours
dark
toffee
brown
with
a
paltry
sized
head
with
no
retention
noted
aromas
of
brown
sugar
cat
food
maple
and
bourbon
booziness
dominate
did
i
just
say
cat
food
yes
yes
i
did
and
apparently
i
am
the
only
one
to
pick
up
on
this
but
i
dont
get
much
enjoyment
out
of
the
aroma
the
taste
loads
up
on
sugary
sweets
treacle
toffee
with
a
maple
and
earthiness
to
it
and
a
big
bourbon
bite
that
i
enjoy
i
do
like
this
though
as
far
as
bourbon
barrel
barleywines
go
this
is
fairly
typical
in
taste
the
thick
body
and
properly
light
carbonation
for
the
style
are
however
spot
on
and
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
would
recommend
this
however
no
more
than
any
other
bourbon
barleywine
i
have
enjoyed
drinkability
this
is
just
a
solid
fn
beer
so
much
bourbon
and
wood
id
say
this
is
the
biggest
tastiest
barrel
aged
beer
that
ive
had
since
wooden
hell
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
oak
that
wh
had
and
its
a
tad
warmer
but
i
think
it
may
be
slightly
less
sweet
in
a
year
or
two
this
thing
is
going
to
come
together
nicely
and
be
absolutely
amazinger
thanks
much
tyler
you
generous
sonofagun
d
fantastic
wished
i
had
more
this
is
by
far
the
best
english
style
barleywine
ive
had
not
a
pretender
definitely
a
top
beer
drinkability
english
barleywine
is
certainly
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
see
why
this
one
stands
out
i
think
the
sweetness
would
overwhelm
me
after
a
while
but
as
4oz
sample
this
was
great
d
this
is
the
king
of
barleywines
incredibly
balanced
with
a
mouthfeel
to
match
and
integrate
the
complexity
that
is
this
beer
seek
it
out
the
hype
is
welldeserved
here
a
joy
to
have
and
one
ill
definitely
be
seeking
out
in
the
future
give
this
one
at
least
three
years
and
maybe
it
will
be
worthy
of
its
ba
rating

2009
bottle
deep
mahogany
pour

the

is
musty
bourbon

the

the

this

will
mature
into
something
amazing

for
now
it
is
only
exceptional
mouthfeel

is

i
am

all
told
perfect

is
a
really

perhaps
near
midnight

arctic

for
among
the
best
ive
tried
i
think
some
age
would
have
bumped
it
to
1
as
about
all
i
can
ding
the
beer
for
is
a
little
harshness
in
taste
and
feel
from
the
alcoholbourbon
flavors
2009
vintage
pours
brown
with
a

this

didnt
disappoint
edit
from

the

is
more
of
the
same
but
the
barrel
aging
and
whiskey
barrel
flavor
is
more
prominent
than
in
previous
versions
for
me
this
just
makes
the
beer
even
more
impressive
and
enjoyable
excellent
stuff
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
english
barleywines
my
head
d
this
was
a
hard
one
to
put
down
sip
after
sip
news
things
are
developing
would
love
to
try
this
down
the
line
with
some
more
age
on
it
ive
not
been
the
hugest
barleywine
fan
in
the
past
but
this
beer
has
changed
my
perception
of
the
style
absolutely
fantastic
overall
a
fantastic
bwine
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
a
little
hot
i
think
this
one
will
get
better
with
age
on
it
and
then
i
will
reevaluate
the
score
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
d
a
damn
fine
brew
one
i
could
sip
on
for
hours
ddo
to
its
rarity
does
it
matter
what
i
can
say
is
this
is
a
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
for
its
complex
flavors
and
smell
hated
to
see
it
go
really
nice
full
body
and
extremely
smooth
very
drinkable
almost
no
alcohol
presence
this
is
hands
down
the
best
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
full
body
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
only
ever
so
slightly
boozy
but
very
warming
drinkability
is
high
because
its
just
so
damn
good
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
tried
thanks
to
ipafool
for
this
pours
rubydark
brown
in
color
with
an
interesting
tan
head
that
recedes
to
nonexistence
smells
and
tastes
amazing
tons
of
bourbon
vanilla
toffee
raisins
dark
fruits
wood
and
alcoholic
heat
this
really
is
liquid
toffee
reminds
me
a
bit
of
fw
abacus
or
fw
10
an
amazing
woodaged
barleywine
body
is
super
thick
but
the
carbonation
slices
through
it
to
prevent
syrupification
i
started
out
the
gate
strong
in
downing
this
but
am
hitting
a
wall
as
i
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
so
drinkability
takes
a
bit
of
a
hit
not
sure
why
this
is
sold
in
bombers
rather
than
12
oz
bottles
but
quite
a
tasty
brew
overall
im
not
a
barleyfine
at
all
but
this
great
beers
may
just
change
my
mind
or
just
is
it
this
beer
this
beer
is
tasty
complex
and
has
the
best
mouthfeel
ive
ever
had
i
would
recommend
this
beer
up
and
down
all
day
overall
this
was
just
incredible
i
had
heard
this
was
one
of
the
best
out
there
but
very
seldom
does
that
hold
true
here
it
does
with
flying
colors
one
of
the
best
hands
down
i
has
ever
had
this
easily
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
being
the
rich
intensely
flavorful
beer
that
it
is
its
definitely
a
sipper
that
being
said
the
light
carbonation
keeps
it
playful
and
the
smoothness
made
me
crave
sip
after
sip
i
went
into
this
thinking
that
it
would
be
pretty
good
but
would
most
likely
not
live
up
to
the
hype
and
i
was
absolutely
wrong
its
exceptional
and
i
only
wish
i
had
more
too
hot
and
too
intense
to
be
very
drinkable
this
one
is
complex
and
tasty
enough
to
keep
me
thirsty
for
more
to
a
point
bottle
brought
down
by
joel
from
the
pub
super
dark
red
color
with
a
small
beige
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
bourbon
influence
and
barrel
character
like
this
spent
some
quality
time
on
wood
dark
burnt
sugars
charred
oak
burnt
vanilla
caramel
alcohol
and
old
wood
the
flavor
is
very
hot
with
lots
of
bourbon
dark
caramel
bunt
fruit
and
charred
wood
the
finish
is
almost
pure
alcohol
and
very
rich
the
mouthfeel
is
very
hot
and
alcoholic
full
and
has
a
modest
amount
of
prickly
carbonation
a
very
big
beer
that
is
not
very
smooth
at
this
point
and
could
use
a
lot
of
time
to
mellow
out
dark
and
burnt
for
a
barleywine
they
really
went
for
it
with
maximum
barrel
extraction
but
it
looks
like
its
going
to
take
a
lot
of
time
to
really
mellow
back
out
bottle
courtesy
joel
pours
a
gorgeous
shimmering
copper
color
with
a
fading
beige
head
aroma
is
sharp
bourbon
lots
of
heat
here
charred
oak
vanilla
this
is
more
bourbony
than
any
barrelaged
beer
ive
had
over
the
top
flavor
is
caramel
and
bourbon
vanilla
leather
and
wood
i
dont
know
if
im
drinking
beer
or
if
a
plane
dropped
a
barrel
on
my
face
needs
a
lot
of
age
to
gain
a
modicum
of
drinkability
also
rather
thin
from
the
spirit
influence
overall
a
little
less
body
and
more
heat
than
i
had
hoped
still
delicious
im
sure
heat
and
drink
will
improve
wcellaring
nice
soft
carbonation
up
front
with
a
medium
body
thats
on
the
fuller
end
promient
oaky
tannis
and
a
huge
vanilla
character
from
the
oak
aging
the
bourbon
is
ore
prominent
in
the
flavor
than
in
the
aroma
but
again
it
isnt
overpowering
but
rather
is
a
nice
compliment
to
the
other
complex
flavors
theres
also
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
especially
raisin
fig
and
date
balancing
out
the
earthy
leathery
malt
notes
the
bourbon
presence
provides
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
but
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
considering
how
well
the
high
abv
is
masked
extremely
smooth
and
if
i
didnt
share
this
bottle
with
some
other
bas
i
would
have
probably
killed
myself
by
drinking
it
too
fast
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
i
cant
recommend
it
and
higher
this
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
incredibly
complex
barleywine
that
will
certainly
improve
with
age
d
this
is
one
to
share
without
a
doubt
the
tiniest
of
sips
was
all
that
was
needed
to
get
a
mouthful
of
flavor
this
years
tps
is
sublime
the
base
beer
08
stormwatchers
is
a
lot
better
than
the
previous
thus
giving
the
ale
a
wonderful
creaminess
and
balance
it
didnt
have
before
i
didnt
realize
this
until
i
did
a
sidebyside
tasting
big
notes
of
vanilla
caramel
prunes
raisins
and
a
little
bourbon
makes
this
years
batch
worth
every
drop
i
have
to
give
a
standing
ovation
to
pelican
for
taking
tps
up
a
notch
they
have
been
producing
some
amazing
beers
under
the
radar
and
tps
is
the
cream
of
the
crop
great
world
class
beer
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
it
has
a
thick
boozy
mouthfeel
and
the
warming
sensation
in
the
stomach
starts
almost
instantly
with
this
brew
the
carbonation
is
light
but
spot
on
for
the
style
and
adds
just
enough
to
make
the
beer
more
complex
the
finish
is
incredible
and
surprisingly
dry
not
sweet
and
boozy
at
all
as
the
beer
warms
the
raisin
and
vanilla
come
out
a
bit
more
making
the
flavors
more
interesting
indeed
update
this
has
become
my
favorite
barleywine
over
the
years
i
look
forward
to
buying
a
case
each
year
this
is
the
only
beer
i
buy
by
the
case
im
drinking
my
last
2012
as
the
leaves
fall
and
thunderstorms
roll
in
this
is
why
i
drink
beer
perfection
this
is
a
great
beer
didnt
rate
it
the
highest
because
i
dont
think
this
is
a
traditional
barleywine
but
extremely
enjoyable
parts
of
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
but
more
complex
brewed
in
my
state
if
i
could
find
another
bottle
of
this
id
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
with
that
world
class
thats
for
sure
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
belongs
where
it
is
now
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
than
the
3
bottle
i
have
left
because
i
can
only
imagine
how
this
is
going
to
taste
in
a
year
or
two
d
immensely
drinkable
easily
the
best
barleywine
available
looking
forward
to
trying
this
each
year
i
love
this
beer
perhaps
the
best
english
barleywine
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
drinkability
i
think
it
drinks
right
around
the
abv
sidebyside
with
the
other
barrelaged
classics
though
it
just
didnt
stand
out
to
me
in
the
same
way
then
again
give
this
a
year
or
two
to
mellow
out
some
boozy
sweetness
and
i
could
easily
see
this
sliding
into
that
tier
d
was
expecting
this
to
be
boozy
and
sweet
with
alot
of
heat
surprisingly
it
was
very
well
balanced
and
complex
but
never
cloying
kinda
reminds
me
of
bourbon
barrel
angels
share
but
chewier
and
actually
carbonated
a
definite
sipper
but
what
a
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
best
barreled
barleywines
ive
had
chewy
thick
mouthfeel
quite
an
achievement
considering
the
abv
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
for
a
13
5
barleywine
while
its
very
rich
its
not
especially
cloying
and
the
complexity
keeps
it
interesting
throughout
md
there
really
isnt
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
but
i
also
enjoy
a
glass
of
good
bourbon
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
oily
and
coats
your
whole
mouth
with
light
carbonation
its
a
sipper
but
one
i
seriously
cant
put
down
a
overall
great
beer
that
should
be
seeked
out
by
any
barleywine
lover
d
i
keep
sipping
this
one
its
very
mellow
considering
the
abv
that
said
the
aftertaste
does
get
a
touch
fatiguing
i
dont
think
id
ever
have
more
than
a
bottle
in
one
sitting
i
think
i
like
abacus
a
little
more
but
this
didnt
disappoint
either

this
was
a

i

on

afterwards
that
ive
had
some
that
are
better
namely
the

this
is
definitely
a

brews

world
wide
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
oily
with
a
small
bite
of

this
is
an
exceptional
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
on
this
one
i
saw
everyone
raving
about
it
but
just
figured
it
wouldnt
live
up
to
the
hype
well
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
its
a
wonderful
beer
that
drinks
fairly
easily
for
the
high
abv
the
bourbon
is
strong
right
now
and
i
think
this
one
becomes
even
better
with
time
superb
this
beer
is
going
to
be
near
perfect
with
a
couple
of
years
in
the
cellar
d
very
enjoyable
but
a
sipper
for
sure
d
extremely
drinkable
for
a
beer
this
big
so
well
rounded
the
strong
and
complex
malt
presence
complemented
perfectly
by
an
equal
wave
of
bourbon
on
the
back
end
much
of
the
same
as
the
last
year
but
more
vanillamarshmellow
flavor
and
smell
id
say
this
years
is
better
and
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
so
i
am
giving
a
5
the
drinkability
is
insane
consider
the
abv
the
beer
opens
sweet
with
strong
vanilla
toffee
and
caramel
notes
oak
adds
a
touch
of
spiciness
bitterness
is
at
a
medium
level
with
that
same
earthy
quality
i
found
in
the
flavor
bourbon
is
well
integrated
providing
complexity
while
not
dominating
alcohol
heat
hints
at
a
beer
below
10
rather
than
the
high
13
5
the
fruit
component
is
reminiscent
of
dates
the
beer
finishes
refreshingly
dry
with
some
noticeable
heat
and
a
whisper
of
soy
sauce
and
sherry
the
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
that
works
very
well
this
is
a
top
notch

barleywine
is
truly
is
a
perfect
storm
i
really
wanted
to
give
this
beer
straight
5s
the
only
reason
i
docked
any
points
was
because
of
the
weak
head
is
that
fair
i
dont
know
everything
else
about
the
look
was
fantastic
but
im
just
trying
to
be
consistent
with
my
other
reviews
when
i
crack
another
one
of
these
in
the
future
i
will
see
if
i
still
feel
the
same
way
about
it
as
i
do
right
now
because
right
now
this
is
on
an
extremely
short
list
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
ever
had
get
it
now
man
am
i
ever
glad
that
i
took
the
time
out
of
my
day
to
run
down
to
pelican
and
pick
up
a
couple
cases
of
this
stuff
not
only
is
it
a
beautiful
place
but
this
beer
is
just
phenomenal
the
smell
is
all
various
bourbon
notes
with
the
vanilla
and
oak
that
you
expect
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
wonderful
malty
backbone
just
behind
it
the
only
ba
beer
that
ive
ever
had
that
took
this
much
flavor
off
the
barrels
is
bourbon
county
stout
but
this
one
is
a
little
less
sweet
and
yet
still
seems
to
have
more
flavor
this
beer
is
the
real
deal
and
is
easily
among
the
best
beers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
if
you
enjoy
this
style
then
the
perfect
storm
should
be
on
your
short
list
of
beers
to
seek
out
outstanding
the
buzz
around
this
beer
seems
to
be
picking
up
its
no
longer
a
nw
secret
and
it
shouldnt
be
because
this
is
an
absolutely
fantastic
barrelaged
barleywine
its
a
keeper
drinkability
amazing
in
every
aspect
but
its
definitely
a
sipper
not
to
mention
the
rarity
of
something
like
this
would
make
me
want
to
sit
back
and
savor
every
last
drop
i
feel
kind
of
honored
just
to
have
had
it
moderate
drinkability
at
best
as
with
most
of
this
style
it
definitely
has
the
potential
for
masquerading
as
a
highlydrinkable
beer
due
to
the
excellent
flavors
and
smooth
drink
gotta
be
careful
with
this
one
d
incredible
beer
here
i
wouldnt
be
greedy
and
drink
a
bottle
by
myself
even
though
i
fantasize
about
it
definitely
worth
the
hype
imho
d
drinks
very
well
for
such
a
huge

this

is

the
last
sip
made
me
shudder
in
oralgasm
my
belly
is
warm
my
soul
content
overall
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
only
beer
that
can
even
hold
a
candle
to
it
is
a
2002
de

reserva
i
have
had
recently
this
beer
will
put
pelican
on
the
maps
bravo
best
barleywine
i
have
ever
except
for
a
certain
one
from
midnight
sun
this
beer
is
outstanding
has
everything
a
barrel
aged
beer
should
talk
about
an
introduction
to
a
brewery
wow
i
plan
on
buying
two
different
vintages
of
stormwatcher
soon
and
comparing
them
to
this
beautiful
ba
version
evan
williams
single
barrel
is
my
favorite
whiskey
and
this
certainly
made
this
beer
unforgettable
wish
this
stuff
was
more
attainable
but
according
to
several
people
there
was
not
much
of
it
made
and
it
sold
out
pretty
quickly
one
of
the
top
beers
of
2009
for
me
i
want
more
now
cannot
recommend
this
enough
what
a
great
beer
this
is
one
of
those
few
beers
that
i
have
had
that
make
me
question
if
the
other
beers
i
have
really
loved
were
really
that
good
i
can
see
why
pelican
has
decided
to
charge
20
per
bomber
it
is
still
a
great
deal
even
at
that
price
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
for
such
a
hefty
barleywine
super
tasty
and
a
real
momentum
builder
i
kept
having
to
remind
myself
of
the
hefty
price
tag
and
extremely
limited
availability
so
that
i
really
savored
the
aftertaste
of
every
sip
rather
then
compulsively
chase
it
with
another
good
enough
in
fact
to
let
them
slide
for
the
condofication
of
pacific
city
the
price
though
is
prohibitive
and
really
the
biggest
knock
on
this
beer

edit
i
have
no
bottles
left
at
this
point
if
youre
trying
to
find
some
i
think
its
well
worth
the
effort
to
keep
looking
overall
this
barleywine
is
dark
smokey
treat
definitely
an
english
version
bottle
this
was
several
years
old
when
i
tried
it
poured
a
ruddy
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
head
it
has
clearly
oxidized
raisins
are
huge
in
the
nose
brown
sugar
sweetness
the
flavor
has
eaten
the
alcohol
effectively
just
a
soft
rap
of
booze
the
flavor
is
very
raisiny
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
a
slight
fruity
tartness
body
is
surprisingly
light
carbonation
has
clearly
fallen
off
a
bit
but
the
softness
works
here
pretty
cool
after
id
say
over
five
years
of
age
overall
this
might
better
be
described
as
an
american
strong
ale
as
the
chocolate
and
leather
qualities
arent
really
appropriate
to
the
barleywine
style
either
way
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
this
is
top
notch
stuff
at
this
point
in
its
expired
life
its
very
flavorful
well
integrated
smooth
complex
and
enjoyable
the
bomber
emptied
far
too
quickly
well
balanced
between
sweet
caramel
flavors
and
dark
malt
character
making
this
one
to
pick
apart
and
savor
glad
i
got
to
drink
this
at
this
point
in
its
life
really
enjoyed
it
okay
this
disappointed
me
not
that
it
was
bad
no
sir
still
on
my
10
ten
barleys
but
i
did
not
find
the
smoothness
in
flavor
or
texture
i
would
have
expected
bit
harsh
would
have
better
labeled
it
an
aged
ipa
i
still
like
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
any
strong
ipa
lover
just
needed
to
explain
by
bias
and
view
point
great
beerale
just
missed
my
expectations
carbonations
a
bit
high
but
it
slows
down
unfortunately
it
can
only
do
that
by
flattening
out
a
little
on
the
end
its
crisp
until
then
and
its
got
some
smoothness
to
the
medium
body
the
taste
has
an
array
of
sweet
malts
raisins
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
and
quite
subtle
hops
this
beer
definitely
got
better
with
age
and
i
am
glad
i
had
the
patience
to
wait
overall
nice
brew
that
was
enjoyable
but
confusing
this
beer
drank
almost
like
a
black
and
tan
of
imperial
stout
and
barleywine
this
needs
to
be
reclassified
as
an
american
strong
ale
overall
this
is
not
what
i
expected
ill
start
brinking
more
barleywines
of
the
english
style
rather
than
the
american
style
if
theyre
all
like
this
tastes
great
goes
down
easy
hidden
alcohol
content
not
much
to
improve
upon
taste
is
lots
of
fruit
and
a
smooth
cache
of
unsweetened
chocolate
and
brown
bread
maltiness
im
somewhat
impressed
with
this
i
like
the
varied
take
on
the
style
it
is
something
like
a
quad
meets
barleywine
hides
the
abv
well
and
really
is
pretty
smooth
i
could
stand
to
grab
another
1
or
2
of
these
seems
like
it
would
age
fairly
well
for
a
year
or
so
cask
pour
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
yellowbrown
coloring
witth
a
chunky
frothy
white
coating
of
head
aromas
of
biscuit
lemony
sweet
rich
toffee
and
a
wet
cedar
hops
presence
smells
balanced
and
tasty
flavors
are
smooth
with
a
toffee
and
apple
sweetness
quickly
cleaned
by
a
bitter
dry
ribbon
of
hops
slight
smoking
and
oaky
character
too
very
dynamic
with
a
bitter
resiny
aftertaste
clean
smooth
finish
of
a
very
robust
bodied
brew
tasty
and
surprisingly
drinkable
o
a
good
english
barley
wine
o
very
dry
i
must
admit
i
am
fairly
new
to
the
barely
wine
game
maybe
this
is
exactly
how
an
english
barley
wine
should
taste
i
was
expecting
something
much
sweeter
a
decent
english
barley
wine
wouldnt
have
minded
a
bit
more
hops
but
the
bitterness
does
seem
to
work
alright
with
unsweetened
chocolate
and
ashy
notes
malt
has
a
bit
of
char
and
roasty
character
and
is
a
bit
aggressive
at
time
with
the
fruitiness
trying
to
offer
balance
has
some
issues
but
a
respectable
beer
a
decent
beer
brought
in
to
the
lcbo
for
a
decent
price
of
8
not
what
i
expect
from
an
english
barleywine
very
bitter
finish
dark
bodied
chocolate
malts
lets
see
how
my
aged
bottle
from
maine
holds
up
over
the
years
above
average
carbonation
good
ingredients
but
not
as
drinkable
as
it
could
be
m
medium
body
creamy
light
carbonation
a
barleywine
that
lacks
the
concentration
and
complexity
of
the
style
is
simply
not
worth
drinking
theres
nothing
inherently
unpleasant
about
shipyard
barley
wine
but
the
problem
is
that
theres
virtually
nothing
to
it
at
all
its
far
from
a
fine
effort
and
given
the
other
beers
in
the
pugsleys
signature
series
we
know
this
brewery
is
capable
of
much
better
o
its
an
okay
beer
nothing
to
brag
about
with
the
muddled
flavors
that
seem
to
be
all
over
the
place
o
a
great
tasting
brew
although
i
would
like
to
see
them
raise
the
bar
on
the
alcohol
for
this
style
just
a
bit
the
result
is
a
ridiculously
drinkable
barley
wine
that
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
again
o
a
complex
brew
with
loads
of
flavour
and
a
nice
cocoa
malt
undertone
that
complements
the
style
nicely
one
of
my
favourites
from
this
brewer
to
date
and
a
worthy
ale

this
would
be
a
good
intro
to
barleywine
not
as
rich
and
flavourfull
as
some
but
still
decent
and
pretty
drinkable

just

it

not
bad
but
not
really
that
good
either
interesting
take
on
the
style
overall
fairly
good
i
doubt
i
would
look
to
have
it
again
but
a
pretty
decent
beer
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
within
the
style
overall
good
sort
of
a
cross
between
an
american
and
english
style
barleywine
as
authentic
a
barleywine
as
you
can
find
in
the
states
these
days
english
in
origin
and
true
to
character
pours
darker
than
expected
quad

bourbon

amazingly
complex
on
the
malty
front
with
caramunich

chocolate
malts
putting
the
final
one
two
combo
on
you
booze
creeps
in
slowly
as
it
warms
tons
of
wood
and
dark
red
dried

to
this
as
well
mouthfeel
works
less
carbonated
than
a
normal
brew
but
more
carbonated
than
a
lot
of
american
barleywines
tons
of
heavy
malts
in
the
body
too
a
great
bomber
if
you
are
only
having
one
this
is
a
true
to
its
heritage
barleywine
worthy
of
any
fine
cuisine
o
not
bad
there
seemed
to
be
a
lot
of
different
flavors
going
on
i
liked
this
and
am
pretty
sure
id
have
this
again
o
not
bad
but
the
acrid
bitterness
in
the
taste
obscures
and
distracts
from
the
malt
profile
review
from
42011
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
very
dark
red
brown
amber
two
finger
head
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
malt
and
roasted
malt
faint
dark

taste
is
dominated
by
malt
slight
dark
fruits
and
roasted
malt
hint
of
sweet
caramel
dry
moderate
hop
finish
pleasant
medium
bodied
not
a
typical
barley
wine
but
interesting
and
nice
to
drink
worth
trying
again
very
dark
not
much
of
a
head
slight
metallic
aroma
little
fruity
and
some
toffeecoffee
scents
in
there
not
a
great
flavor
here
drinkable
but
somewhat
disappointing
nah
now
that
i
take
another
sip
its
really
not
for
me
bitterness
is
vegetal
very
little
sweetness
to
balance
it
too
thin
for
the
style
this
was
a
drain
pour
i
have
limited
experience
with
this
style
but
it
isnt
in
the
same
class
as
youngs
old
nick
ill
cleanse
with
an
arrogant
bastard
ill
be
fine
if
a
wee
sad
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
really
challenging
and
the
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
this
barley
wine
is
better
with
a
meal
i
consumed
it
from
a
dogfish
head
snifter
after
cellaring
for
about
one
year
while
the
beer
was
a
perfectly
fine
purchase
from
happy
harrys
in
grand
forks
the
meld
of
the
flavors
doesnt
blend
well
not
unhappy
with
the
beer
but
wont
be
trying
another
one
this
is
a
mediumbodied
barleywine
with
just
a
bit
of
oily
slickness
to
the
mouthfeel
it
tastes
a
little
stronger
than
the
8
5
abv
listed
maybe
it
will
keep
folks
me
from
pounding
it
down
like
a
fool
o
the
variety
of
the
six
different
malts
used
to
make
this
beer
add
some
complexity
to
the
taste
and
makes
this
a
little
more
interesting
to
drink
compared
to
others
in
the
style
still
glad
i
tried
it
the
dark
nearly
roasted
malts
in
shipyards
barleywine
make
it
an
interesting
offshoot
at
a
year
old
its
developing
interesting
complexity
i
might
grab
an
extra
bottle
or
two
just
to
see
what
it
does
in
another
year
over
all
not
to
bad
but
not
that
great
id
try
it
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
but
wont
be
seeking
out
another
bottle
pours
a
clear
super
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
thin
rings
of
foamy
lace
cling
to
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
nuts
brown
sugar
toffee
and
caramel
there
is
a
fruity
smell
that
i
am
getting
as
well
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
roasted
nuts
coffee
beans
and
some
burnt
sugar
flavors
i
am
also
getting
some
cocoa
powder
as
the
beer
warms
a
medium
roasty
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
barleywine
that
is
much
darker
and
more
roasty
than
i
was
expecting
ya
know
this
is
a
better
barleywine
than
the
scores
lead
on
maybe
one
day
ill
try
it
fresh
and
enjoy
the
hoppiness
the
label
proclaims
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
kind
of
wish
i
had
picked
up
one
while
i
was
in
new
hampshire
i
guess
ill
have
to
next
time
im
up
there
o
not
bad
this
one
doesnt
break
my
list
of
favorite
barleywines
but
its
a
fine
ale
glad
to
have
a
couple
more
aging
in
cellar
enjoy
drinkability
i
was
surprised
by
this
on
the
whole
because
to
me
its
more
of
a
hybrid
style
i
wouldve
guessed
from
all
the
english
versions
that
this
is
pretty
much
distinctively
an
american
version
complex
not
insanely
alcoholic
and
worth
your
time
sipping
nice
job
pugsley
i
held
onto
this
one
since
last
year
bought
as
a
signature
series
pack
this
blurs
the
line
for
me
for
what
a
barleywine
should
be
but
it
was
so
damn
good
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
ill
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
drinkability
excellent
brew
for
fireside
no
english
butteriness
that
i
was
wondering
about
just
great
flavors
from
the
malt
and
hops
the
pour
was
decent
though
a
bit
lifeless
for
me
rich
amber
color
almost
copper
in
hue
with
a
nice
touch
of
cloudiness
to
it
that
really
gave
it
a
very
thick
look
nearly
opaque
at
times
no
real
head
though
and
it
almost
looked
flat
at
first
pour
not
really
encouraged
right
off
the
bat
the
aroma
was
rich
and
sweet
nice
notes
of
bready
malts
hints
of
almost
honey
like
notes
and
a
nice
fruit
touch
toward
the
finish
the
flavor
though
really
perked
me
up
a
bit
sweet
mellow
with
all
notes
of
abv
long
gone
by
the
wayside
lots
of
biscuit
like
notes
a
touch
of
faded
hops
and
a
load
of
grain
all
combined
to
really
give
quite
a
nice
show
overall
very
impressed
here
with
the
way
it
tasted
especially
in
the
finish
which
was
again
very
sweet
and
nearly
perfectly
placed
an
easy
sipper
i
almost
went
through
this
one
too
quickly
as
it
had
mellowed
to
the
point
of
being
equally
rich
and
subtle
mo
drinkable
for
the
style
nice
start
but
the
overall
appeal
for
me
is
lost
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
there
is
a
sharpness
that
takes
away
from
the
feel
of
this
beer
a
fair
offering
for
the
style
edit
as
an
earlier
review
notes
let
this
beer
warm
a
bit
before
reviewing
it
changes
greatly
d
drinks
great
for
a
nightdessert
beer
very
unique
flavor
and
different
for
the
average
barleywines
out
there
over
all
i
enjoy
it
but
not
my
favorite
future
outlook
nah
even
if
it
were
available
here
no
need
to
have
again
notes
interesting
barelywine
plenty
of
dark
malt
that
overshadows
the
hops
some
citrus
and
tea
hop
flavors
come
out
but
it
is
definitely
a
malt
forward
barleywine
not
horrible
but
nothing
i
would
be
really
excited
about
drinking
maybe
a
hoppy
porter
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
a
good
price
the
hops
kinda
threw
me
off
moderately
hopped
for
an
english
barleywine
i
didnt
mind
too
much
though
drinks
good
i
would
buy
this
again
if
it
was
cheaper

with
a

in

shipyard
bsa
tastes
and
feels
like
a
hybrid
barley
winestout
to
me
and
is
not
what
i
expected
but
is
not
bad
at
all
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
given
style
an
easy
drinker
at
8
abv
the
alcohol
is
barely
detectable
good
beer
but
a
bit
overpriced
picked
this
one
up
at
a
tobacco
shop
on
the
outskirts
of
old
town
in
san
diego
poured
a
robust
reddishbrown
color
with
a
good
tan
head
aromas
of
chocolate
caramel
dried
fruit
and
light
brown
sugar
medium
bodied
flavors
of
caramel
dried
fruit
leather
and
light
hops
nothing
special
but
drinkable
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
for
the
most
part
the
beers
in
the
shipyard
signature
series
are
a
good
value
this
is
not
a
barley
wine
more
like
a
crossover
barely
winestout
or
something
akin
to
the
gm
aztek
carminivanwhatever
monstrosity
even
the
8
5abv
indicates
something
may
be
amiss
whatever
this
is
i
wish
they
would
call
it
something
other
than
barely
wine
overall
this
was
a
little
bland
but
not
bad
at
1022oz
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
again

dominate
the
palate
very
grainy
sweet
and
sticky
booze
is
actually
well
hidden
despite
the
nose
slight
yeasty
spiciness
as
well
chewy
creamy
body
with
moderate
carbonation
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
but
still
solid
while
the
aroma
is
quite
interesting
and
enjoyable
to
explore
the
flavor
of
this
is
just
not
very
appealing
i
wonder
if
a
lot
more
age
will
turn
this
into
a
really
funky
old
ale
the
carbonation
is
already
getting
a
bit
excessive
though
and
i
would
worry
about
the
integrity
of
the
bottle
after
a
few
more
years
of
age
body
is
mild
compared
to
the
strong
flavor
profile
still
goes
down
smooth
but
leaves
an
acidiccharcoal
after
taste
i
dont
mind
that
at
all
it
looks
like
imperial
porter
is
the
best
of
the
four
pugsleys
signature
series
beers
xxxx
ipa
smashed
pumpkin
and
now
barley
wine
style
ale
are
merely
better
than
average
given
the
10
price
tag
not
recommended
unless
youre
a
big
fan
of
the
style
or
the
brewery
drinks
easy
once
a
bit
of
up
front
astringency
passes
stays
true
to
the
style
maybe
the
best
beer
from
these
guys
ive
had
this
beer
poured
well
into
sifter
there
was
a
lot
of
head
and
lace
the
body
was
deep
amber
with
a
reddish
hue
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
were
both
rich
it
was
not
as
hopped
as
most
barley
wines
which
i
appreciated
there
was
a
warm
like
chocolate
alcohol
presents
in
the
flavor
this
is
a
sweet
after
dinner
or
late
evening
beer
there
is
a
very
heavy
mouthfeel
d
god
taste
and
feel
i
could
probably
drink
this
for
a
while
however
this
would
not
fall
under
the
old
standy
beer
category
by
the
way
ive
never
had
a
barleywine
form
a
bottle
with
a
screwcap
respect
to
shipyard
for
sticking
to
their
guns
in
their
true
manner
of
sticking
with
english
styles
and
not
jumping
on
the
extreme
beer
wagon
a
job
well
done
with
a
less
respected
and
underrated
beer
style
overall
i
really
severly
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
it
was
one
note
and
overly
burnt
not
to
mention
it
missed
out
on
all
the
complexity
and
great
flavors
that
go
along
with
this
style
i
thought
this
was
closer
to
a
porter
with
a
decent
hop
note
than
a
barleywine
not
my
cup
of
tea
overall
great
barleywine
that
is
not
too
sickly
sweet
like
some
other
ones
are
this
is
a
job
well
done
and
definitely
recommend
for
others
to
try
glad
to
see
shipyard
putting
some
of
their
bigger
brews
on
the
shelves
here
in
oklahoma
give
us
more
drinkability
is
nice
pretty
good
balance
a
nice
english
bw
the
mouthfeel
is
above
medium
bodied
but
probably
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
style
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
for
my
tastes
in
barleywines
as
well
drinkability
isnt
bad
it
had
some
nice
flavors
to
it
overall
and
was
nice
to
sip
on
this
evening
decent
beer
overall
d
decidedly
different
and
significantly
underrated
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
offering
all
in
all
the
brewery
messed
up
this
is
not
by
any
means
a
barley
wine
this
is
a
stout
or
a
porter
stretch
but
not
a
barley
wine
i
rated
this
as
a
barley
wine
because
that
is
what
it
is
labeled
to
be
as
far
as
barley
wines
go
this
is
not
good
avoid
big
thanks
goes
out
to
jerz
on
this
one
drinkability
a
crescendo
of
flavor
complex
and
sippable
reminiscent
of
a
good
whiskey
taste
is

boozy
and
sharp
carbonation
the
body
is
very
light
and
sweet
drinkability
is
very
harsh
and
quite
tame
shipyard
barley
wine
is
a
dark
ruby
ale
with
a
brown
sugar
colored
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
very
wooden
aroma
it
smells
resiny
and
smokey
with
some
sweetness
and
warmth
its
full
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
chewy
finish
it
tastes
very
smokey
and
resiny
with
lots
of
roastiness
it
has
a

quality
its
mature
with
some
nice
complexity
its
a
nice
late
night
sipper
drink
i
wont
pick
one
up
again
but
it
certainly
wasnt
a
drainpour
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
bit
light
for
the
style
with
low
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
stuff
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
its
just
a
little
too
light
for
the
style
for
me
thanks
eric
out
of
a
bomber
bottle
this
beer
was
a
nearly
opaque
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
of
tan
bubbles
that
quickly
became
an
even
thinner
skim
it
looked
like
a
porter
the
retention
was
unimpressive
and
the
lacing
was
spotty
the
aroma
was
malty
alcoholic
and
dry
with
hints
of
wood
similar
to
a
barrelaged
whiskey
in
ways
the
flavors
were
bold
and
similar
to
the
aroma
though
with
better
complexity
right
from
the
start
i
could
taste
the
8
alc
but
as
this
faded
off
my
tongue
i
got
the
dark
bready
malts
elements
then
the
bittering
hops
followed
by
a
long
chocolate
malt
finish
that
lingered
forever
a
jolt
at
first
but
i
grew
fonder
of
it
as
i
imbibed
as
it
warmed
i
smelled
more
caramel
malt
and
tasted
more
of
it
too
the
flavors
were
very
roasty
and
not
really
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
barley
wine
i
did
enjoy
the
coffee
and
slightly
spicy
notes
though
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
appropriate
an
odd
version
of
a
barley
wine
but
still
an
enjoyable
one
good
drinkability
but
also
kind
of
boring
a
nice
mild
flavored
beer
but
it
could
be
more
exciting
cheers
eric
this
is
a
very
good
barlywine
if
not
too
traditional
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
porter
with
the
addition
of
the
chocolate
malt
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
even
on
this
hot
summer
day
is
very
refreshing
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
subdued
which
is
a
welcome
attribute
as
barley
wines
tend
to
be
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
alcohol
i
realize
that
high
apv
is
indicative
to
this
style
of
beer
but
i
think
too
many
go
a
bit
too
far
with
it
at
the
expense
of
drinkability
i
appreciate
beers
like
dogfishheads
olde
school
with
its
15
apv
but
this
is
a
barleywine
that
can
be
appreciated
in
the
warm
weather
as
well
as
in
winter
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
yet
from
shipyard
drinkability
is
pretty
good
more
in
what
i
would
i
would
call
an
old
ale
due
to
the
darker
malts
not
worth
going
to
far
out
of
your
way
for
but
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
chance
probably
could
have
used
more
cellar
time
to
tame
the
bite
overall
very
good
i
really
like
it
i
would
love
another
i
highly
recommend
it
great
beer
and
the
cellar
aging
i
am
sure
helped
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
f
lingering
syrupy
sweetness
some
bitterness
lingers
with
some
fruit
a
little
smoke
comes
out
on
the
finish
as
well
pretty
chewy
finish
too
and
sticks
to
the
mouth
this
was
nice
a
good
beer
to
have
on
occasion
not
my
favorite
bw
but
an
enjoyable
one
clearly
not
the
biggest
barleywine
at
8
5
this
is
on
the
more
subdued
end
of
the
barleywine
spectrum
and
a
decent
try
at
the
style
has
some
redeeming
qualities
and
for
5
99
a
bomber
its
not
a
bad
deal
but
probably
not
one
ill
remember
with
extraordinary
fondness
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
then
expected
still
has
some
oily
viscosity
to
it
similar
to
a
quad
but
doesnt
have
that
sweet
sticky
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
normally
associate
with
bws
very
smooth
with
a
somewhat
dry
finish
which
makes
this
one
quite
an
easy
bomber
to
finishand
the
respectively
lower
alcohol
percentage
doesnt
hurt
the
drinkability
either
decent
barleywine
nothing
overly
special
but
a
solid
american
version
of
an
american
barleywine
drinkability
overall
a
very
nice
effort
that
brings
nice
complexity
to
the
style
a
well
rounded
flavorful
and
balanced
beer
with
just
enough
heft
to
take
the
chill
off
d
bleh
just
wasnt
impressed
very
much
by
this
one
roasty
aftertaste
medium
heavy
body
very
nice
shipyard
does
well
with
there
pugsley
series
will
drink
this
again
d
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
on
earth
bitterness
beats
me
over
the
head
one
too
many
times
the
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
obviously
not
a
session

drinkability
is
not
so
great
barleywines
are
usually
a
sipper
but
for
a
bomber
of
this
i
was
wishing
it
didnt
have
so
much
ash
flavor
in
it
to
make
it
more
drinkable
the
carbonation
is
good
but
its
a
little
too
thin
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
one
finishes
nice
and
clean
that
keeps
the
sips
in
quick
succession
d
good
this
beer
will
taste
much
better
in
one
year
from
now
22
oz
nice
rather
dark
brown
cloudy
pour
just
a
little
off
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
subtle
malt
molasses
toffee
aromas
taste
has
the
malt
and
toffee
but
a
very
prevelent
bitter
note
a
little
ashy
sourness
finishes
with
this
bitter
fruit
or
bitter
nut
note
the
malt
sweet
and
fruit
tones
are
quite
subdued
almost
watered
down
alcohol
is
not
strong
drinkability
would
be
quite
high
if
not
for
the
bitter
tinge
lighter
bodied
than
standard
ok
but
just
not
that
meal
i
expect
an
english
barleywine
to
be
the
soursmoke
is
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
as
well
even
mouthfeel
a
bit
slick
but
finishes
tingly
decent
beer
worth
trying
but
perhaps
not
earthshaking
i
love
barleywine
and
ill
come
back
to
this
one
but
it
didnt
fulfill
my
nostalgic
desire
for
a
true
english
barleywine
im
looking
forward
to
finishing
the
rest
of
this
bomber
with
my
pepperoni
pizza
if
i
ever
see
this
beer
again
i
will
gladly
snap
up
a
pint
or
bottle
pours
a
very
nice
very
deep
red
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacingoil
slicks
left
behind
the
nose
is
a
different
one
to
a
english
barleywine
very
malty
with
some
chocolate
roast
notes
some
hops
slightly
fruity
dark
the
taste
is
very
nice
malty
with
some
nice
chocolate
notes
roasty
slight
hoppy
also
picking
up
some
figs
raisins
plums
medium
body
slightly
dry
finish
drinkable
i
really
like
this
one
quite
complex
drinkability
is
good
spot
on
for
the
style
with
extra
dose
of
hops
ruby
colour
beige
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
but
there
is
also
some
hops
in
the
nose
it
has
a
funky
acidic
quality
that
makes
it
less
pleasurable
and
there
is
also
dark
fruit
in
there
flavour
is
surprisingly
watery
for
a
beer
with
as
high
abv
like
this
has
it
has
a
nice
bitterness
is
enjoyable
unfortunately
this
beer
is
full
of
funky
chemical
notes
that
makes
it
less
than
convincing
and
it
also
has
the
same
sour
flavour
that
i
found
in
the
aroma
it
has
some
malts
in
it
that
makes
it
acceptable
to
drink
but
not
more
mouthfeel
is
just
plain
average
this
is
a
bad
example
of
the
style
i
will
avoid
it
in
the
future
nice
reddishblack
color
with
small
bubbles
and
creamy
deep
tan
head
chocolate
and
bourbon
are
very
prevalent
with
touches
of
mahogony
and
earthiness
has
a
surprisingly
thin
body
despite
the
strong
flavors
and
dark
color
but
there
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
hidden
behind
it
a
slight
bitterness
but
the
sour
mash
of
the
bourbon
comes
through
in
the
end
reducing
the
beers
drinkability
the
carbonation
also
doesnt
hold
very
well
with
the
thin
body
overall
for
the
style
they
were
going
for
they
english
barleywine
its
not
bad
but
it
never
quite
engages
you
dark
and
mellow
more
suitable
for
a
winter
warmer
that
should
be
a
much
better
price
think
avery
old
jubilation
the
beer
was
a
dark
brown
color
and
looked
clear
i
didnt
see
any
yeast
or
cloudiness
but
it
was
so
opaque
it
was
hard
to
tell
i
smelled
small
malt
and
fruit
the
taste
was
much
hoppier
than
i
like
for
a
barleywine
the
hops
almost
dominated
i
could
pick
up
some
raisin
and
fig
but
it
was
mainly
hops
the
beer
had
an
interesting
creamy
texture
and
there
was
no
alcohol
burn
very
tasty
but
this
is
just
not
a
barleywine
a
strong
ale
perhaps
still
its
the
tastiest
offering
from
shipyard
ive
ever
sipped
and
im
not
going
to
penalize
it
any
style
points
this
is
awesome
a
truly
great
english
barleywine
there
are
lots
of
complexities
something
i
highly
recommend
taste
nearly
like
a
oaked
aged
porter
with
smoked
malts
finishes
dry
and
with
a
slight
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
very
unique
and
not
similar
to
any
barleywines
ive
ever
had
the
beer
sat
deep
red
in
the
wine
glass
and
if
the
light
struck
it
the
right
way
looked
almost
black
the
head
atop
was
quite
large
for
the
style
looming
at
nearly
three
finger
thick
the
smell
was
roasty
with
coffee
and
dark
fruit
which
was
very
nice
had
this
been
a
stout
it
was
quite
odd
to
smell
these
aromas
in
a
barleywine
the
taste
was
a
mix
of
astringent
and
roasty
flavors
followed
by
a
caramel
finish
which
was
again
way
out
of
place
for
the
style
the
beer
also
lacked
much
sweetness
which
is
what
i
thought
english
barleywines
were
all
about
i
feel
a
little
bad
rating
it
this
low
on
the
taste
as
i
liked
the
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
displayed
none
of
the
velvety
characteristics
and
syrupy
viscosity
i
was
expecting
and
at
only
8
5
no
warmth
to
speak
of
either
what
were
you
smoking
when
you
wrote
the
recipe
mr
pugsley
conclusion
this
is
definitely
an
end
of
the
night
beer
the
alcohol
gets
a
little
hot
after
a
bit
but
this
is
big
bold
and
seductive
as
a
barleywine
should
be
the
flavour
it
has
is
pretty
good
and
it
is
not
onedimensional
but
the
flaovurs
are
a
bit
thin
and
subdued
while
the
alcoholic
heat
and
bitterness
are
a
bit
too
strong
it
gets
smoother
but
also
more
bland
over
time
an
interesting
barley
wine
for
sure
tasted
like
figs
prunes
and
raisins
with
a
nice
coffeeflavored
kick
not
too
alcoholic
tasting
but
just
very
odd
a
great
and
enjoyable
sipper
that
gives
a
fresh
take
on
a
style
that
i
am
still
learning
about
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
some
dry
english
hops
also
noticeable
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sweet
malt
with
light
biscuit
notes
with
some
dry
english
hops
malts
are
lacking
in
complexity
with
no
dry
fruit
or
any
other
characteristics
body
is
a
bit
light
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
complex
malt
aroma
that
leans
more
to
the
roastedchocolate
side
it
dry
with
a
light
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
moderate
burnt
toffee
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
warm
with
a
nice
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
i
love
the
aroma
and
its
got
pretty
nice
malt
character
the
pugsley
series
is
turning
out
to
be
the
class
of
their
lineup
drinkability
ate
a
full
dinner
and
have
quite
a
buzz
after
this
one
measley
8
5
beer
feels
like
a
11
one
feels
much
more
like
an
american
style
bwine
than
an
english
not
bad
by
any
means
just
out
of
style
still
perfectly
fine
tasty
and
quaffable
the
appearance
is
a
dark
redish
brown
with
a
nice
2
finger
tan
head
leaves
a
flaky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
scent
is
complicated
and
gets
better
as
it
gets
warmer
mostly
fruity
and
not
a
lot
of
other
wine
like
characteristics
other
barley
wines
have
been
very
much
like
a
wine
didnt
enjoy
them
so
much
the
flavor
is
mostly
fruit
as
well
but
there
is
some
bitterness
that
bites
the
tongue
its
a
full
body
beer
that
makes
for
drinking
a
bomber
pretty
easy
pours
a
nice
one
finger
light
tan
head
pretty
deep
red
and
brown
color
more
like
garnet
nice
lacing
for
a

fruit
cake
with
a
good
splash
of
mandarin
and
blood
orange
rinds
in
the
aroma
taste
starts
with
some
dark
fruits
plums
maraschino
like
black
cherries
and
some
apricots
rum
cakey
and
dry
peppermint
hop
spice
the
alcohol
is
elusive
its
therejus
behind
the
scenes
helping
the
other
flavors
stand
out
good
smooth
dry
sipper
d
this
beer
is
very
smooth
to
drink
but
with
nice
complexity
and
new
layers
of
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
a
great
english
style
barley
wine
that
is
big
but
shows
depth
aswell
i
dont
think
i
would
age
this
one
as
it
might
lose
some
of
its
complexity
very
drinkable
no
boozy
aftertaste
this
is
something
i
would
drink
often
not
blown
away
by
any
means
nice
barleywne
for
the
6
99
price
i
paid
poured
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
mahogany
edges
and
a
thick
tan
head
creamy
looking
thick
sticky
lacing
never
seen
a
barleywine
look
like
this
more
like
a
cream
stout
or
imperial
porter
earthy
wooden
malt
with
a
chunk
of
cocoa
powder
and
hops
in
the
nose
equally
creamy
mouthfeel
very
unexpected
roasty
malt
again
earthy
and
wooden
the
chocolate
really
comes
through
as
it
warms
there
is
a
resiny
bite
but
it
comes
off
more
like
part
of
a
barrelaged
character
it
was
very
nice
but
the
density
and
heft
of
the
beer
made
it
a
bit
unwieldly
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
had
wished
someone
was
there
to
help
me
finish
the
bomber
mild
carbonation
with
some
fluff
to
the
mouthfeel
a
medium
dose
of
alcohol
and
a
medium
full
body
add
goodness
to
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
not
a
bad
english
style
bw
at
all
rather
authentic
and
definetely
worth
a
go
comments
i
did
enjoy
the
rather
fast
onset
of
the
beer
buzz
but
the
off
flavor
was
rather
irritating
so
after
the
first
few
pulls
i
finished
the
brew
quickly
i
must
say
that
the
other
qualities
of
the
beer
do
warrant
me
trying
this
brew
again
in
case
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
it
does
happen
even
with
fine
brews
poured
a
deep
brownish
red
with
some
tan
foam
and
a
nice
amount
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
was
very
bitter
for
me
and
a
style
of
a
stout
the
flavor
was
better
as
it
got
warmer
the
taste
of
bitter
hops
roasted
malts
coffee
and
a
hint
of
prune
is
what
i
could
taste
but
for
me
it
was
to
bitter
and
that
is
what
took
away
a
lot
of
the
different
flavors
wait
for
it
to
warm
up
the
flavor
will
be
more
complex
a
super
dark
black
brown
ale
with
a
ring
of
light
tan
big
bubbles
on
top
good
lacing
follows
the
aroma
is
deep
rootbeer
evergreen
with
bountiful
molasses
malt
and
figraisin
thick
and
bountiful
and
wow
what
flavor
again
a
thick
melange
of
coffee
malted
milk
with
more
dark
fruits
and
a
touch
of
spruce
just
a
beautiful
mouthful
of
deep
blended
grains
and
figs
this
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
very
smooth
but
somewhat
resinous
feel
carbonation
is
minor
but
perfectly
adequate
for
such
a
flavorful
brew
outstanding
stuff
that
deserves
a
slow
appreciation
not
too
bad
surprising
amount
of
leafy
hop
balanced
with
generous
malty
brown
sugar
sweetness
a
pretty
decent
barelywine
with
flavors
bold
enough
that
they
even
cover
the
flavors
of
the
ringwood
yeast
nicely
overall
i
really
like
this
one
it
bridges
the
divide
between
english
and
american
barleywines
if
i
saw
this
one
again
i
would
probably
grab
one
to
have
and
one
to
lay
down
pours

mediumheavy

flavor
is
some
sweet
maltiness
but
lacks
the
seriousness
of
a
good
barleywine
musty

at

there
are
better
barleywines

for
a
22
oz
bottle
from

wine
wells
me
not
a
bad
brew
to
drink
but
this
brew
misses
the
style
pretty
easily
over
all
though
different
from
others
that
ive
had
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
barleywine
not
too
over
powering
d
notes
a
perfectly
fine
barleywine
i
would
have
liked
more
character
on
the
malt
side
of
things
and
actually
a
little
more
sweetness
pours
flat
and
black

no
head
into
my
unibroue
trois
pistoles
goblet
grape
jelly
aroma
raiseny
and
port
like
too
its
like
dark
fruit
but
somehow
off
a
very
strange
bitter
taste
not
at
all
pleasant
im
wondering
if
this
is
a
bad
beer
yet
i
press
on
metallic
and
bitter
and
a
mouthfeel
that
is
simply
unpleasant
this
beer
is
a
disaster
from
beginning
to
end
i
have
to
assume
it
was
spoiled
down
the
drain
it
went
if
i
ever
come
accross
this
brew
again
ill
give
it
another
chance
if
its
free
otherwise
avoid
this
mess
at
all
costs
pours

the
darker
side

wine
a
dark

with
a
short
head
to
start
that
fades
to
nothing
smells
sweet
grainy
roasty
and
with
some
piney
and
earthy
hops
there
is
also
a
residual
yeast
smell
that
smells
typically
english
a
bit
roasty
for
a
barley
wine
but
fine
the
taste
is
less
roasty
but
quite
a
bit
more
hoppy
with
piney
earthy
and
citrusy
hops
combined
with
more
roastiness
some
dark
fruit
and
quite
a
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
smooth
and
somewhat
thick
in
the
mouth
thisn
wasnt
bad
but
it
didnt
really
represent
the
barley
wine
style
that
well
i
dont
mind
the
extra
hops
in
a
barley
wine
but
i
do
want
some
extra
sweetness
to
go
with
it
and
the
extra
roastiness
was
a
bit
out
of
place
still
it
was
enjoyable

not
remarkable

the
bitterness
is

not
quite
what
i
expected
not
really
a
barleywine
so
that
goes
against
it
but
it
tastes
decent
and
goes
down
easy
this
one
sad
to
say
isnt
for
me
it
rolls
like
a
strongish
brown
ale

its
not
a
barleywine

me

dark

roasted

sessionable
barleywines

have

it

an
american
strong
ale

d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
barleywine
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
worth
a
shot
im
not
usually
a
big
barley
wine
fan
but
this
one
was
good
a
nice
strong
brew
plenty
of
oomph
without
being
obnoxious
this
is
a
creamy
beer
it
has
many
of
the
elements
of
a
superior
english
porter
theres
a
dark
chocolate
with
cherry
flavor
that
has
some
notes
from
a
barley
wine
still
this
is
a
strong
departure
from
the
style
and
i
like
it
i
find
it
very
drinkable
without
too
much
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
semifull
and
the
beer
is
generally
semidry
the
alcohol
definitely
emerges
and
leaves
that
peppery
feel
in
the
late
finish
its
okay
but
i
will
never
pay
that
much
money
for
it

i
really
dont
like
this
one
starts
out
promising
but
i
feel
that
this
falls
flat
in
the
drinkability
department
it
may
need
some
aging
but
im
troubled
by
the

heat
that
just
seems
to
crowd
out
other
flavors

really

doesnt

this
was

one
i
tried
and

the
beer
was
a
dark

color

quickly
dissipating
tan

the
aroma
was
predominately
of
dark
fruit
with
a
little
malt
presence
the
taste
was
cherry
and
raisin
malt
first
then
some
hops
the
label
said
a
dry
finish
and
i
would
agree
i
thought
this
was
a
good
example
of
an
english
barleywine
and
would
drink
it
again

enjoying
the
aroma
the
bitter
but
smooth
hoppiness
reminded
me
of
a
barley
wine
i
let
it
sit
for
a
while
and
warm
up
and
it
just
got
better
topping
in
flavor
well
into
the
high
50s
low
60s
never
got
bad
good
from
the
1st
sip
to
the
last
now

note
bottle
was
from
2012
aged
about
16
months
taste
is
rich
full
of
brandied
candied
fruits
caramelised
bread
spicy
raisiny
character
some
woodypeppery
bitterness
bite
supporting
a
rich
sweetness
feel
is
full
not
too
oily
or
thick
a
bit
lively
lots
of
rich
toast
in
aftertaste
the
taste
has
a
a
woody
hop
flavor
mixed
with
a
honeycaramel
taste
from
the
malt
which
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
bit
of
yeast
fruitiness
comes
through
but
alcohol
flavor
soon
takes
over
with
some
oxidation
present
in
the
taste
i
liked
this
for
the
most
part
it
is
not
very
cohesive
and
kind
of
hits
you
randomly
with
hops
adding
a
spiced
impact
yet
a
nice
dose
of
malt
sweetness
is
present
iike
the
concept
more
than
the
actual
flavor
o
eh
not
really
good
just
too
much
of
everything
the
bourbon
barrel
version
of
this
is
much
better
this
ones
pretty
atrocious
honestly
dont
buy
it
hot
damn
this
is
a
great
full
flavored
sipping
barleywine
i
will
certainly
look
for
this
again
as
i
feel
like
i
paid
8
for
the
22
oz
bottle
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
new
barleywine
to
try
in
general
an
excellent
beer
perhaps
other
reviewers
served
it
too
cold
or
in
a
glass
which
doesnt
enhance
the
english
barley
wine
consistency
overall
a
sweet
but
enjoyable
barley
wine
a
nice
slow
sipper
and
worth
a
try
well
at
least
i
cleared
a
bottle
from
the
cellar
not
a
huge
fan
of
regular
old
thumper
but
this
i
will
buy
again
overall
b
84
o
not
one
i
would
go
for
again
just
way
too
much
sweetness
to
be
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
this
beer
excels
at
maintaning
its
british
roots
while
taking
on
american
boldness
a
very
good
strong
ale
o
taking
the
style
into
consideration
not
bad
at
all
but
this
is
a
very
aggressive
esb
that
could
use
some
more
balance
to
it
worth
a
try
i
suppose
a
pretty
good
high
abv
malt
bomb
i
certainly
got
the
warming
malty
finish
described
on
the
bottle
label
but
not
any
spicy
hop
aroma
still
there
is
plenty
of
good
stuff
going
on
with
this
beer
definitely
not
a
session
brew
but
does
go
down
well
while
watching
some
sunday
football
22
ounce
bottle
i
know
ive
had
this
beer
a
little
while
but
i
just
dont
remember
exactly
how
long
so
i
have
no
idea
how
old
it
is
no
date
on
the
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
copper
color
with
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
is
decent
and
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
toffee
butterscotch
dark
fruit
and
some
bready
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
the
addition
of
some
booze
nuts
and
a
bit
of
spice
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
creamy
and
slick
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
id
like
to
try
this
fresher
in
the
future
but
i
definitely
liked
this
beer
with
some
age
on
it
it
has
potential
this
one
but
does
not
really
deliver
a
bit
to
much
bitterness
and
stickyness
o
its
a
good
beer
but
would
be
better
classified
as
an
old
aie
o
this
thing
is
a
beast
not
only
will
i
be
drinking
water
after
this
but
my
palate
feels
wrecked
oh
well
no
big
deal
just
curious
i
wonder
if
this
is
more
of
a
barleywine
id
probably
only
have
this
again
on
special
occasions
or
see
if
i
could
find
it
on
tap
somewhere
o
this
really
doubles
the
style
guidelines
for
this
beer
so
its
hard
to
really
judge
it
based
on
the
style
but
the
alcohol
taste
is
a
little
too
overwhelming
i
would
really
consider
this
much
closer
to
an
english
barleywine
considering
its
strength
which
i
love
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
originally
reviewed
07122011
this
probably
should
come
in
a
smaller
bottle
i
know
22s
are
meant
to
share
but
why
cant
we
get
a
7oz
of
this
instead
bit
weird
a
bit
odd
but
theres
plenty
of
salvageable
material
here
and
i
wish
i
just
warmed
to
this
more
readily
overall
this
is
a
beer
of
contrasts
there
are
some
really
interesting
things
to
it
and
some
things
that
just
dont
work
at
all
i
like
the
really
strong
english
bitterness
but
i
feel
as
though
that
would
have
been
better
utilised
in
a
beer
half
its
strength
this
beer
is
a
light
chestnut
color
with
a
thin
white
head
its
a
glassyclear
liquid
essentially
still
a
malt
and
hop
aroma
dark
grain
ethanol
toasted
wood
and
spicy
hops
the
spiciness
carries
over
to
the
flavor
which
is
unfortunately
disjointed
its
a
jumble
of
sweetness
nearly
independent
of
the
malt
and
alcoholic
hotness
fresh
and
sharp
bitterness
is
a
fleeting
sensation
the
finish
is
lingering
sweet
and
warm
its
full
in
body
and
very
intense
overall
interesting
brew
tastes
a
bit
like
a
strong
beer
mixed
with
scotch
or
whisky
its
a
good
mix
though
goodtasting
and
interesting
to
think
about
been
in
the
cellar
for
about
8
months
and
i
wish
i
had
tried
it
sooner
because
i
love
it
beautiful
orange
and
amber
color
the
smell
is
sweet
and
boozey
with
some
biscuit
and
sweet
fruit
the
taste
is
by
no
way
balanced
yet
flows
pretty
well
and
is
interesting
it
goes
from
quick
biscuit
to
fruit
with
a
in
my
opinion
smooth
hop
and
a
nice
boozey
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
slick
and
comforting
and
the
finish
lingers
long
enough
but
doesnt
over
stay
its
welcome
over
all
if
i
saw
it
on
a
menu
or
in
a
store
i
would
make
the
purchase
without
hesitation
as
a
friend
out
it
its
just
too
double
and
not
enough
thumper
overall
less
thump
than
i
was
hoping
for
unless
theyre
referring
to
the
sound
you
make
when
you
hit
the
ground
ooverall
this
a
very
good
brew
i
dig
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
beer
i
know
this
is
an
amped
up
version
of
the
old
thumper
ale
but
i
thought
this
was
more
close
to
the
export
ale
i
think
this
would
pair
well
with
some
bbq
absolutely
formidable
intense
and
amazing
so
rich
so
complex
so
round
so
fully
packed
bright
fierce
indomitable
mmmm
i
like
this
ought
to
pick
up
more
for
the
winter
months
its
coming
gonna
need
a
big
wooly
warming
ale
like
this
onice
flavors
and
suprisingly
easy
drinking
high
alcohol
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
one
that
would
work
nicely
both
for
fans
of
barleywine
and
those
who
favor
bitters
esbs
and
brown
ales
but
want
something
a
little
bigger
drinkability
this
to
me
doesnt
feel
like
a
brew
with
this
power
ive
never
had
the
original
so
maybe
that
makes
me
not
as
much
of
an
expert
as
i
should
be
i
think
balance
is
the
key
and
as
much
as
im
enjoying
this
this
isnt
the
case
still
check
it
out
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
this
beer
scored
so
low
in
others
ratings
its
both
beautiful
and
scrumptious
it
poured
like
a
thick
barley
wine
with
a
slow
to
emerge
beige
1
head
in
masstone
its
a
burnt
sienna
brown
but
held
to
the
light
theres
a
pretty
hazy
reddish
tint
smell
is
great
with
rich
malt
caramel
and
hops
but
not
a
slap
in
the
face
amount
of
them
taste
is
delicious
kind
of
like
candied
hops
rich
sweet
with
caramel
toffee
and
barley
wine
attributes
i
dont
always
drink
sweet
or
bold
beers
but
i
find
this
old
thumper
very
appealing
and
the
11
2
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
a
boozy
burning
mess
in
my
opinion
i
say
nice
job
shipyard
taste
is
syrupy
sweet
to
start
strong
pine
prickling
in
the
middle
and
a
warm
alcohol
close
than
intensifies
over
time
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
okay
as
well
seems
like
everything
in
this
brew
is
intensified
from
the
original
old
thumper
for
better
or
worse
overall
certainly
not
your
everyday
beer
this
one
tries
to
accomplish
many
tastes
with
a
heavy
alcohol
content
hops
and
toastiness
start
to
dominate
after
awhile
and
may
benefit
from
some
aging
it
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
for
10
not
too
heavy
feel
and
little
alcohol
in
taste
and
warming
i
really
dont
think
its
worth
the
expense
at
this
point
but
possibly
in
a
year
or
2
d
quite
a
big
heavy
beer
the
sugar
character
is
as
cloying
as
one
would
expect
with
some
oddly
strong
spicy
notes
that
further
enhance
the
effect
and
make
it
even
more
of
a
sipping
beer
not
a
drain
pour
but
not
particularly
enjoyable
either
about
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
shipyard
the
alcohol
is
quite
present
in
the
taste
also
there
is
a
bittering
hop
that
i
didnt
notice
in
the
smell
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
is
very
warming
i
think
it
is
too
much
of
a
good
thing
i
would
not
categorize
this
as
an
esb
i
think
it
is
far
too
potent
barley
wine
is
a
better
description
the
body
matches
this
well
rich
mouthfeel
with
enough
carbonation
to
prevent
it
from
being
cloy
in
the
end
theres
too
much
alcohol
to
make
this
work
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
i
can
see
where
it
wouldnt
appeal
to
some
but
imo
its
certainly
worth
i
try
old
thumper
is
a
beer
that
i
really
enjoyhaving
it
on
cask
in
kennebunkport
was
a
thrilli
just
wonder
why
this
beer
was
madebut
i
actually
kinda
liked
it
poured
into
an
imperial
nonic
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
thinner
but
well
retained
head
the
ringwood
yeast
brings
the
big
buttery
notes
along
with
gummy
fruit
esters
and
sweet
alcoholflavors
are
buttery
caramel
and
big
sweet
alcoholthe
hops
are
really
subdued
to
me
this
is
a
ringwood
yeast
dominated
english
barleywine
with
its
big
sweetness
and
alcohol
i
like
this
beer
as
a
sipper
but
its
not
overly
complex
in
natureiam
glad
i
tried
it
overall
its
ok
and
certainly
interesting
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
it
all
that
often
its
kind
of
a
harsh
beer
and
would
probably
be
best
in
fairly
small
portions
overallthis
is
not
an
everyday
beer
and
i
dont
want
to
drink
more
then
maybe
8
oz
at
a
time
i
couldnt
finish
the
11oz
that
i
poured
a
creative
beer
but
not
very
drinkable
this
is
an
average
extreme
beer
from
shipyard
i
dont
enjoy
it
as
much
as
smashed
pumpkin
or
some
members
of
pugsleys
signature
series
double
thumper
wont
replace
regular
old
thumper
for
me
especially
when
its
on
cask
at
the
great
lost
bear
pours
an
attractive
clear
coppery
redbrown
with
a
fairly
thick
and
somewhat
persistent
pale
copperytan
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
strong
aroma
is
malty
and
a
little
yeasty
with
a
firm
overtone
of
apple
brandy
sharp
malty
flavor
has
a
strong
brandy
tang
and
hints
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
caramel
with
just
a
whisper
of
fruity
sweetness
ragged
texture
is
fairly
fizzy
and
leaves
behind
a
mild
but
persistent
tingle
this
is
a
slightly
sweet
dense
scone
slathered
in
a
sweet
but
tangy
apricot
jam
this
is
delicious
and
exceeds
my
expectations
especially
for
its
high
abv
it
is
immensely
drinkable
overall
a
ghastly
brew
thats
downright
hard
to
drink
instead
of
a
double
thumper
id
rather
have
had
two
thumpers
i
was
a
bit
leery
of
this
one
once
i
saw
the
abv
listing
but
thought
to
myself
how
bad
could
it
be
pretty
bad
apparently
poured
a
clear
amber
faintly
reddish
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
of
head
the
aroma
has
a
dark
sweetness
an
earthy
must
with
some
prunes
and
red
grapes
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
dark
fruity
malts
a
large
amount
of
sweetness
and
an
alcohol
bite
on
the
finish
dry
and
slightly
sour
for
the
finish
but
overall
very
sweet
and
dark
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
its
not
really
my
style
of
beer
but
its
something
id
drink
again
reading
about
this
one
on
a
beer
advocate
forum
i
was
very
excited
to
try
it
i
got
the
opportunity
when
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
at
bevmo
in
san
diego
wow
to
be
completely
honest
this
beer
was
terrible
aromas
of
sweet
malt
butter
and
alcohol
similar
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
and
loaded
with
diacetyl
the
alcohol
kept
me
going
on
the
bottle
but
it
wasnt
fun
overall
id
say
that
this
beer
was
worth
trying
and
id
probably
also
try
it
on
draft
if
i
see
it
but
i
wont
see
it
out
o
by
the
time
i
finished
this
i
wasnt
so
sure
about
the
vinous
qualities
i
initially
picked
up
on
in
the
mouthfeel
once
the
hops
kick
in
it
feels
much
heavier
and
drier
but
there
are
occasional
traces
of
the
initial
mouthfeel
probably
attributable
to
the
high
alcohol
by
volume
the
finish
is
bitter
and
lingering
this
ones
a
mixed
bag
this
one
is
a
beastie
beer
that
is
way
to
easy
to
drink
cheers
not
an
easy
drinker
here
lots
to
handle
here
and
the
last
few
ounces
are
a
struggle
a
little
pricy
for
what
you
get
just
my
take
finish
carries
through
with
the
pine
bitter
character
this
could
perhaps
be
a
sipper
but
not
all
that
appealing
do
not
see
with
food
poured
into
a
snifter
hazy
golden
amber
in
appearance
good
lacing
but
faint
head
aroma
is
of
mainly
yeast
not
impressive
some
citrus
some
hops
but
mainly
yeast
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
taste
is
boozy
and
yeasty
there
is
some
citrusy
hops
some
nuttiness
yeast
flavor
just
is
overbearing
i
had
this
on
tap
before
the
bottle
and
on
tap
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
from
the
bottle
it
is
almost
a
completely
different
brew
drinkability
is
good
this
does
lack
a
little
in
the
complexity
department
but
its
a
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
but
honestly
seemed
a
little
light
bodied
for
the
style
this
was
one
of
the
better
characteristics
however
overall
this
is
not
something
i
enjoyed
drinking
and
i
considered
pouring
it
for
a
while
i
was
very
disappointed
in
the
brew
and
most
certainly
will
not
purchase
another
d
maybe
not
my
style
o
bitterness
and
high
alcohol
make
this
an
interesting
beer
but
i
dont
think
id
want
to
drink
more
than
one
notes
im
rarely
overpowered
by
a
beer
and
love
my
big
beers
but
this
one
and
its
unrestrained
boozy
bitterness
almost
did
me
in
unfortunately
it
wasnt
particularly
in
a
good
way
with
a
near
nil
drinkability
and
at
7
5022oz
not
sure
if
double
old
thumper
is
really
any
better
than
the
regular
version
since
i
havent
really
cared
for
either
if
im
picking
up
shipyard
its
going
to
be
prelude
very
solid
beer
has
the
malt
ive
been
looking
for
and
with
the
increase
in
everything
this
yeast
strain
really
takes
on
a
different
character
this
beer
does
not
drink
like
an
11
percent
beer
dangerously
quaffable
and
enjoyable
someone
else
said
more
like
an
barleywine
and
would
like
to
see
how
it
ages
i
would
too
i
dont
think
it
will
get
too
much
better
but
why
the
hell
not
finally
found
it
22oz
bomber
purchased
at
mckinnons
in
salem
pours
a
crystalclear
amberred
body
with
pretty
much
no
head
to
speak
of
nut
butter
bread
and
just
a
touch
of
booze
in
the
aroma
bready
fruity
with
nut
touch
of
butter
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
though
its
more
of
a
warming
than
a
flavor
full
bodied
bordering
on
viscous
with
low
carbonation
a
meal
of
a
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
this
reminds
me
more
of
an
english
barleywine
than
an
esb
id
be
interested
to
see
ifhow
this
ages
this
beer
is
simply
overwhelming
while
i
like
big
beers
this
tastes
like
a
beer
cocktail
im
halfway
through
this
monster
and
im
not
sure
ill
be
finishing
it
o
tough
to
finish
one
and
the
unpleasant
bitterness
makes
me
reticent
to
revisit
this
one
its
more
than
other
esbs
as
this
is
more
astringent
than
other
bitters
final
thought
shipyard
please
try
lowering
your
prices
i
might
want
to
drink
your
beer
more
often
d
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
it
will
be
difficult
to
drink
this
entire
bottle
without
dumping
some
down
the
drain
d
with
this
being
my
first
of
the
style
i
liked
it
will
try
more
in
this
style
and
this
one
again
d
there
is
some
novelty
value
here
but
overall
this
is
a
miss
for
me
i
think
calling
this
an
esb
is
a
misleading
mistake
to
be
fair
though
they
dont
call
it
an
esb
on
their
website
i
think
american
strong
ale
or
barleywine
would
be
much
more
apt
surprisingly
the
mouthfeel
was
not
bad
at
all
it
would
have
been
a
4
5
or
5
0
if
it
wasnt
for
the
slightly
excessive
alcohol
heat
the
appearance
was
great
nice
caramel
color
and
very
clear
d
to
say
this
beer
has
characteristics
of
spicy
hops
is
an
understatement
this
is
seriously
spicy
throughout
with
a
very
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
spice
is
what
really
is
throwing
me
off
i
am
a
big
fan
of
old
thumper
and
was
looking
forward
to
the
double
but
sadly
i
think
i
enjoy
old
thumper
quite
a
bit
more
d
considering
its
strength
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
worth
a
try
if
you
liked
the
other
imperial
offerings
from
shipyard
i
enjoyed
smashed
pumpkin
and
ditto
on
this
offering
da
big
bruiser
of
a
beer
that
one
must
drink
with
some
respect
i
really
enjoyed
the
fruity
notes
combined
with
the
malt
sweetness
an
enjoyable
sipper
for
sure
well
done
shipyard
ramping
old
thumper
up
to
an
eleven
drinkability
once
is
enough
for
this
one
the
bomber
at
one
sitting
was
more
than
enough
still
would
drink
it
again
drinkabilty
is
piss
poor
pours
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good

nice

7
99
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
northend
superette
manchester
nh
all
this
being
said
i
think
shipyard
slugged
a
homerun
with
this
one
my
wife
loves
the
smashed
pumpkin
and
hated
this
one
me
i
really
loved
this
one
and
while
i
still
enjoy
the
smashed
pumpkin
id
much
rather
be
sipping
this
mac
daddy
i
picked
up
a
bottle
this
past
week
at
shipyard
while
on
business
in
maine
because
i
really
wanted
to
try
this
one
im
back
up
there
in
a
few
weeks
and
ill
be
stopping
by
again
to
get
more
bottles
and
cellar
a
few
to
see
where
they
go
big
beers
like
this
often
get
better
with
age
and
this
one
is
already
good
when
its
young
a
very
interesting
observation
is
the
bottled
version
seems
to
be
far
hoppier
than
the
tap
version
definitely
prefer
the
bottle
which
i
cant
say
about
very
many
beers
note
bonus
points
in
that
this
is
highly
reminiscent
of
the
original
old
thumper
which
is
an
old
favorite
of
mine
from
when
i
lived
in
beantown
i
found
it
very
strong
starting
in
my
mouth
but
finished
smooth
in
down
the
throat
at
first
i
was
a
little
nervous
thiking
that
it
might
be
to
powering
but
was
surprised
how
is
it
ws
to
drink
its
something
i
would
drink
slow
to
savory
the
taste
i
would
drink
it
again
dthis
beer
has
good
drinkability
but
the
hop
bitterness
starts
to
accumulate
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
this
is
fine
because
at
112
abv
you
wouldnt
be
drinking
more
than
one
bomber
of
this
anyway
i
need
to
put
this
sidebyside
with
old
thumper
imo
this
with
the
exception
that
it
is
11
abv
is
maybe
more
accessible
than
the
original
dnot
high
in
the
drinkability
category
too
boozy
would
like
some
more
balance
perhaps
with
a
stronger
hop
profile
took
me
forever
to
drink
from
the
22
fl
oz
bottle
it
pours
a
nice
handsome
copperamber
with
a
nice
inch
or
so
head
good
clarity
the
aroma
is
malty
with
noticeable
ringwood
yeasts
the
body
comes
in
at
about
medium
unlike
the
original
old
thumper
the
ringwood
yeasts
are
not
quite
as
obvious
but
they
do
touch
the
nose
the
taste
has
a
nice
malty
characteristic
with
a
muted
hoppy
ending
the
doubledigit
abv
is
barely
noticeable
d
at
11
2
it
maybe
too
drinkable
i
would
buy
it
again
but
i
would
split
it
with
a
friend
not
a
bad
english
barley
wine
d
scary
drinkable
at
11
2
wish
i
was
trying
it
with
food
the
label
says
it
pairs
well
with
ribs
lamb
hearty
stews
and
casseroles
would
probably
be
great
to
cook
with
as
well
a
well
made
barleywine
thats
solid
not
overly
complex
a
good
base
beer
to
throw
in
barrels
and
build
off
of
o
nice
example
of
an
english
barleywine
loads
of
maltiness
typical
caramel
bread
and
cocoa
flavors
light
bits
of
noble
hops
id
say
well
balanced
smooth
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
very
decent
barleywine
but
lacks
some
depth
and
complexity
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
english
barleywine
it
is
not
overtly
sweet
as
some
are
i
think
this
would
be
better
with
some
age
deep
brown
with
ruby
edges
in
the
light
small
tan
head
with
rather
tight
bubbles
deep
serious
malt
presence
toffee
and
dark
fruit
with
some
faint
yeasty
esters
palate
of
sticky
toffee
warming
alcohol
strong
malt
backbone
some
spicy
hop
notes
to
balance
def
some
darker
malts
in
here
so
smooth
and
balanced
velvet

the
tongue

goodness

form

overall

not

an

should
be
still
drinking
a

hot
though
overall
its
a
decent
beer
and
a
fun
try
but
like
most
of
my
experiences
with
jackie
os
the
promise
isnt
quite
delivered
brick
kiln
is
a
solid
basic
english
barleywine
no
bells
or
whistles
but
its
spot
on
for
the
style
im
relatively
certain
that
this
would
age
quite
well
too
bad
i
only
had
one
a
very
standard
effort
thats
below
the
grade
of
the
jackie
os
stuff
that
ive
been
sampling
recently
bad
certainly
not
good
certainly
not
just
beer
overall
really
love
this
brew
fantastic

a
very
enjoyable
offering
wow
in
my
limited
exposure
to
this
brewery
i
am
very
very
impressed
and
this
barleywine
is
definitely
something
special
its
darker
than
most
looks
like
an
old
ale
richer
deep
brown
complexion
and
not
much
head
on
it
plenty
of
viscosity
to
the
feel
slippery
and
thick
with
just
a
prickle
of
carbonation
flavors
range
in
grain
from
dark
and
roasty
to
sweet
and
coppery
then
tangy
even
and
a
hint
smoky
which
is
to
say
that
its
very
complex
at
its
base
there
is
a
lingering
molasses
or
honey
sweetness
to
this
and
a
mineral
presence
unique
to
the
style
definitely
not
hoppy
so
maybe
more
in
the
english
tradition
although
i
dont
get
much
yeast
character
in
here
either
i
love
the
slick
feel
the
lack
of
alcohol
presence
which
is
insane
for
how
big
this
is
and
i
love
that
the
grain
comes
in
waves
one
after
the
next
so
its
never
muddled
or
messy
impressive
take
on
the
style
i
like
the
darker
complexion
of
this
and
think
it
suits
the
season
well
so
cool
too
to
see
this
pouring
in
colorado
i
enjoyed
one
at
jakes
brew
bar
in
littleton
last
night
go
drink
it
up
o
while
not
an
amazing
beer
its
pretty
fair
and
true
to
style
where
this
beer
shines
is
the
mouthfeel
if
you
see
it
on
tap
treat
yourself
dont
search
for
it
though
cheers
o
fantastic
beer
if
you
can
find
it
pick
it
up
the
brick
kiln
packs
a
wallop
this
beer
is
big
yet
tasty
the
beer
poured
a
opaque
brown
with
ecru
head
that
is
not
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
carries
a
peat
caramel
type
flare
the
taste
was
a
nice
malt
balance
that
had
scotchpeat
like
base
with
subtle
dark
fruit
on
top
the
mouthfeel
was
full
in
body
with
subtle
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
barley
wine
and
i
would
recommend
it
overall
tasty
but
not
very
complex
and
too
bitter
to
be
exemplary
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
ever
since
thomas
hardys
bit
the
dust
i
have
been
looking
for
the
next
favorite
barley
wine
and
while
this
is
very
close
to
a
few
aged
ones
i
have
had
it
deserves
to
be
laid
down
for
a
few
years
to
mature
an
a
plus
overall
im
happy
with
this
complex
ale
going
on
here
a
really
nice
barleywine
in
the
heart
of
ohios
appalachia
the
alcohol
overpowers
the
flavor
just
a
bit
it
is
still
outstanding
though
it
has
a
real
barrel
quality
though
there
is
no
mention
of
i
think
this
beer
is
just
a
hair
away
from
being
a
world
class
barleywine
very
true
to
the
english
style
so
if
you
enjoy
that
it
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
i
would
love
to
have
a
bourbon
barrel
version
of
this
375
ml
bottle
2014
vintage
served
in
a
dfh
snifter
the
beer
pours

with
a

some

i
should
have
bought
some
more
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
never
had
it
before

a
bottle
o
nice
barleywine
from
jackie
os
the
bottle
may
seem
a
bit
pricy
but
if
it
comes
down
to
about
the
price
of
a
pint
of
craft
beer
at
the
bar
and
its
this
good
well
worth
the
purchase
had
on
tap
at
chappys
in
dayton
served
in
tulip
glass
nice
dark
color
could
not
see
if
it
was
black
or
dark
brown
nice
smell
for
the
style
nice
a
malty
tastes
little
to
no
taste
of
hops
had
an
awesome
creamy
feeling
as
the
beer
warmed
it
got
better
i
would
say
it
maybe
was
served
too
cold
to
begin
with
awesome
beer
from
a
awesome
brewery
cant
wait
to
see
more
of
their
stuff
in
cans
and
hopefully
some
day
in
bottles
too
on
tap
at
jackie
os
served
in
a
sampler
glass
pours
a
moderatelydark
brown
color
nose
has
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
darker
malt
flavor
has
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
but
thats
balanced
a
good
bit
by
the
sweetness
probably
also
tasted
a
bit
boozy
after
just
having
had
the
ultrasmooth
dark
apparition
on
cask
medium
full
body
a
slow
sipper
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
and
a
slight
coffee
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
pretty
strong

in
this
case
i
do

it
works
this
is

this
is

that

seems
to

added

woohoo

still
not

this
is
a
good
brew
goodwoohoogood
eric
awesome
barleywine
that
is
even
better
once
its
been
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
thanks
howopeeps
for
the
opportunity
the
bourbon
greatly
increases
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
beer
i
just
had
the
brick
kiln
and
this
is
an
amazing
transformation
the
barrel
aging
takes
a
good
beer
to
greatness
on
par
with
bcbs
imo
pours
to
a
deep
dark
blackish
brown
body
nose
is
a
fluffy
inch
and
a
half
of
milk
chocolate
brown
head
very
elegant
and
sexy
in
the
glass
nose
is
a
gorgeous
rich
smell
full
of
sweet
bourbon
notes
and
tones
of
carmel
and
toffee
dancing
together
in
a
perfect
aroma
symphony
the
nose
of
so
luscious
i
hope
the
taste
stands
up
to
it
enters
into
the
mouth
with
smooth
and
silky
feel
carmel
and
bourbon
are
meet
with
a
lingering
hop
character
that
shows
this
was
a
hoppy
barleywine
to
start
lovely
and
rich
in
flavor
with
tons
of
sweetness
and
toffee
that
really
define
this
beer
there
is
a
nice
dryness
to
the
finish
of
this
brew
that
does
well
to
add
a
proper
element
of
balance
to
the
beer
finally
getting
around
to
trying
this
one
and
man
was
i
in
for
a
treat
waited
til
it
warmed
a
little
to
get
the
true
bourbon
barrel
character
and
barrelaged
it
was
lots
of
dessertlike
sweetness
in
the
malt
with
burnt
sugar
toasted
coconut
caramel
and
the
definite
bourbon
and
oak
that
was
dominant
throughout
tons
of
bourbon
barrel
in
this
one
an
amazing
beer
just
wish
the
price
tag
hadnt
been
so
steep
so
glad
i
tried
it
though
another
great
beer
by
jackie
os
this
is
the
englishstyle
barleywine
in
my
book
phenomenal
this
is
one
of
those
rare
beers
that
would
be
perfectly
content
to
be
poured
over
a
dish
of
vanilla
ice
cream
it
is
easily
in
the
top
3
of
all
the
bourbonbarrelaged
english
barleywines
ive
had
ranking
only
slightly
behind
bcbbw
and
sucaba
and
only
because
it
lacks
some
of
the
complexities
of
flavor
of
those
beers
a
beautiful
beer
from
jackie
os
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectation
o
this
is
one
of
the
single
most
bourbony
barrelaged
beers
ive
tried
with
an
aftertaste
of
alcohol
that
has
some
of
the
sting
and
burn
of
sipping
directly
on
a
couple
fingers
of
whiskey
neat
while
barleywines
by
and
large
are
boozy
things
this
takes
the
booziest
award
by
far
it
would
probably
do
well
with
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
really
enjoyed
this
bbbw
right
up
there
with
the
bc
and
kuhnhenns
flavor
level
not
right
there
but
close
kinda
expensive
but
worth
it
i
think
12
7
ounce
bottle
2014
vintage
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
decent
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
vanilla
bourbon
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
the
addition
of
some
wood
molasses
and
dark
bread
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
syrupy
and
coating
with
lowmoderate
carbonation
its
a
pretty
tasty
brew
might
have
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
it
was
either
11
99
or
12
99
a
bottle
i
forget
which
regardless
of
the
price
its
worth
trying
at
least
once
this
beer
has
a
sturdy
feel
in
its
full
body
with
good
movement
some
alcohol
coming
in
but
remaining
smooth
and
crisp
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
flow
without
being
overdone
bourbon
doesnt
add
much
on
top
of
the
normal
version
very
smooth
beer
a
bit
heavy
on
the
sweet
edge
with
a
maple
kind
of
thing
going
on
vanilla
seems
to
be
there
also
probably
could
use
some
age
to
round
things
out
but
its
a
nice
beer
glad
i
picked
it
up
overall
very
complex
and
changes
well
as
it
warms
quite
a
remarkable
beer
i
will
certainly
be
picking
up
a
couple
more
of
these
to
age
if
i
can
find
them
again
o
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
smell
but
that
doesnt
mean
it
is
bad
i
thought
i
was
diving
into
a
sucaba
when
i
stuck
my
nose
in
it
i
think
the
bourbon
flavor
while
very
good
is
just
a
hair
on
the
hot
side
like
bb
dark
apparition
to
me
that
is
the
only
difference
between
this
beer
and
the
elite
bourbon
barrel
barleys
it
just
isnt
as
smooth
and
balanced
as
a
sucaba
or
bourbon
county
or
even
their
own
black
maple
for
example
still
an
outstanding
beer
they
continue
to
roll
out
one
great
barrel
aged
beer
after
another
overall
a
very
nice
ba
barleywine
price
point
a
bit
extravagant
but
to
me
worth
it
for
this
nice
cold
weather
sipper
o
it
is
not
a
very
traditional
barley
wine
but
damn
it
is
good
a
smooth
bourbon
barrelaged
barleywine
the
whiskey
and
vanilla
oak
works
well
with
the
malty
base
beer
first
offering
from
jackie
os
and
i
really
quite
enjoyed
it
barley
wines
are
a
delicate
style
for
me
and
can
be
pretty
hit
or
miss
this
was
definitely
more
on
the
hit
side
i
actually
enjoyed
it
more
than
the
alesmith
ba
old
numbskull
the
big
ol
popular
and
highly
acclaimed
ba
barley
wine
that
i
was
expecting
to
like
more
like
settling
for
the
slightly
less
appealing
assistant
captain
cheerleader
then
finding
out
her
parents
are
millionaires
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
bourbon
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
bourbon
and
wood
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
nice
bourbon
presence
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
overall
its
jackie
os
and
its
not
sour
yay
very
nice
barleywine
excellent
barrel
character
there
is
more
caramel
and
vanilla
in
this
one
than
there
was
in
the
rum
version
i
love
the
sweet
caramel
notes
and
thought
the
beer
was
quite
smooth
there
is
more
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
less
fruit
notes
than
the
rum
id
have
more
in
the
future

heat
in

than
on

silky
smooth
mildly
carbonated

a

this
beer
is
awesome
fresh
and
will
only
get
more
polished
with
age
d
a
very
solid
and
wellcrafted
barrelaged
barleywine
surprisingly
mature
and
restrained
for
brad
and
co
and
i
dig
it
hopefully
this
is
scheduled
for
the
december

as
i

carried
the

making
it
drinkable
i
really
liked
this
beer
this
is
good
im
looking
forward
to
trying
my
black
cap
overall
my
first
hoppin
frog
and
if
they
make
other
beers
like
this
one
far
from
my
last
delicious
combination
of
the
english
and
belgian
aspects
i
thought
the
barrel
character
may
overwhelm
this
beer
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
it
just
melded
nicely
with
the
complexity
this
is
a
terrific
beer
i
hope
i
can
still
get
another
bottle
and
age
it
for
a
while
taste
very
nice
from
the
start
as
it
warmed
the
sweetness
increased
and
i
got
hints
of
syrup
this
would
be
my
only
complaint
about
this
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
the
barrel
character
was
perfect
and
the
caramel
and
malts
really
shined
feel
was
good
overall
im
happy
i
got
to
try
this
beer
another
great
offering
from
hoppin
frog
pours
a
dark
brown
with
hardly
any
head
at
all
i
poured
it
a
bit
warmer
around
50
degrees
and
the
heat
from
the
alcohol
was
definitely
on
the
nose
along
with
some
boozy
liquor
sweet
bread
and
whiskey
taste
was
a
lot
like
the
smell
but
with
even
more
added
complexity
almost
reminiscent
of
a
scotch
ale
a
little
backwoods
bastard
in
there
somewhere
sweet
sugary
malts
bourbon
as
well
as
some
vanilla
oak
and
coconut
on
the
back
end
some
burn
of
alcohol
is
present
but
in
the
most
decadent
way
possible
this
one
was
a
delicious
sipper
id
easily
pay
20bomber
on
another
one
of
these
any
day
and
that
doesnt
happen
too
often
o
complex
and
quite
tasty
i
do
wish
i
could
have
aged
it
as
i
think
it
will
integrate
and
gain
complexity
then
again
ill
just
try
to
find
another
bottle
bottle
from
joe
thanks
pours
dark

brown

as
expected
but
with
some

and
another
note
that
almost
seems
quad
like
i
assume
the
year
is
the
belgian
influence
flavor

dark

leather
caramel
some
oak

dryness
coconut
and
vanilla
finish
thick
body
with
medium
low
carbonation
coating
the
tongue
definitely
different
from
the
standard
ba
barleywine
but
very
nice
this
is
a
port
level
sweet
beer
but
it
hasnt
come
together
yet
with
25
years
of
age
this
is
going
to
drink
absurdly
well
i
highly
recomend
grabbing
this
one
and
aging
the
body
alternates
confusingly
but
very
interestingly
between
thick
rich
and
viscous
and
thinner
alcohol
running
in
and
out
on
the
tongue
so
its
hard
to
keep
track
of
it
adds
a
bit
of
sting
as
well
though
not
harshly
i
remains
semisweet
and
doesnt
run
too
sweet
because
of
the
hoppier
elements
mostly
keeping
some
dryness
in
it

an

all

incredible

barrel
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to

on
for
the
big
abv
an
extremely
amazing
offering
o
a
really
great
offering
from
hoppin
frog
at
21
99
for
a
22oz
bomber
it
better
be
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
though
i
think
with
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
it
would
really
shine
odthis
probably
has
about
a
year
or
more
on
it
age
wise
its
has
mellowed
and
integrated
itself
its
tasty
but
i
must
say
i
can
imagine
that
i
may
have
enjoyed
it
more
fresh
but
how
should
i
know
an
expensive
beer
i
remember
it
being
around
23
for
a
bomber
it
got
better
after
each
sip
recommended
for
sure
thanks
al
for
sharing
a
solid
offering
nicely
developed
and
wellputtogether
so
my
verdict
on
this
one
happy
to
have
had
it
but
its
over
rated
and
wrongly
labelled
if
you
like
your
beers
big
and
sweet
this
ones
for
you
hoppin
frogs
barrel
aged
naked
evil
barleywine
is
a
notably
rich
and
sweet
beer
that
probably
would
have
been
better
enjoyed
if
it
were
divided
by
four
people
on
a
cold
january
night
rather
than
split
between
two
people
on
a
warm
august
evening
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
it
this
beer
is
best
in
small
quantities
my
nose
was
right
haha
oh
well
apparently
belgian
made
me
think
more
old
ale
due
to
the
sweetness
and
also
explains
the
bit
of
spice
i
picked
up
if
my
memory
is
correct
this
is
a
few
years
old
now
barrel
integrated
very
well
very
nice
beer
pours
amber
with
deep
ruby
red
accents
capped
with
a
one
finger
light
beige
head
which
dissipates
very
quickly
however
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
throughout
deep
rich
aroma
of
oak
vanilla
booze
dark
fruit
and
toffee
opens
with
a
burst
of
plum
black
cherry
fig
and
rich
accents
of
date
joined
by
vanilla
and
caramel
finishes
with
toffee
booziness
and
just
a
hint
of
whiskey
full
bodied
with
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
coats
the
inside
of
the
mouth
and
low
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
beer
certainly
trends
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
never
reaches
the
point
of
being
cloying
ive
had
better
rare
barleywines
in
the
past
but

this
one
out
mouthfeeloverallmedium
full
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
about
right
lingering
finish
of
toffee
and
whiskey
overall
this
beer
hits
about
all
the
right
notes
for
me
ill
throw
in
a
disclaimer
that
it
is
very
sweet
but
for
my
tastes
not
overly
sweet
it
has
plenty
of
subtlety
and
complexity
in
the
flavor
the
citrus
component
gives
it
some
uniqueness
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
nice
coppery
color
i
messed
up
and
poured
the
sediment
in
hereotherwise
it
would
be
spotless
to
say
the
least
very
fine
narrow
lacing
around
the

of
the

buttery
and
a

like
flavors
caramel
and

abound
long
lingering
sticky

just
enough
of
the

to

know
it

very

not

in

at

just
a
great
beer
all
in
one
of
the
best
uk
barleywines
i
have
had
i
got
this
in
an
xmas
trade
that
was
80
barrel
aged
stuff
so
have
held
off
until
now
a
real
treat
for
sure
thanks
laura
aka
ladyofmuchbeer
wow
i
wish
i
remember
who
sent
me
this
one
props
to
you
maximum
respect
this
beautiful
offering
melds
ba
barleywine
with
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
admittrdly
im
not
a
big
fan
of
many
yeasty
belgians
but
this
one
is
blissful
now
officially
a
permawant
sorry
i
usually
follow
the
usual
format
but
i
was
in
the
moment
this
time
haha
o
a
this
is
an
amazing
beer
very
well
done
and
im
so
sad
that
i
only
had
1
of
these
im
was
blown
away
by
almost
every
aspect
of
this
beer
o
this
beer
was
ok
taste
was
too
sweet
and
all
over
the
place
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
balanced
and
this
beer
is
very
sweet
i
think
the
whiskey
barrels
made
a
huge
contribution
to
this
beer
it
is
very
well
rounded
o
really
really
good
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
except
that
its
maybe
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
nothing
a
little
age
wouldnt
keep
under
control
thanks
again

i
aged
this
one
for
about
year
and
was
rewarded
nicely
poured
into
a
glass
from
the
bottle
the
ale
was
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
white
head
that
left
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
beer
had
a
pleasant
boozy
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
vanilla
hidden
in
the
aroma
in
the
initial
taste
one
gets
a
nutty
fruity
citrus
sensation
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
in
the
background
there
is
a
virtual
explosion
of
taste
here
because
there
is
so
much
going
on
while
one
gets
the
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
it
is
well
masked
the
warming
continues
into
the
aftertaste
with
nutty
and
fruity
sensations
continuing
by
far
this
was
the
winner
at
a
recent
testing
and
my
personal
favorite
from
hoppin
frog
oone
of
the
the
better
barrel
aged
barleywines
not
as
good
as
sucaba
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
some
more
barrel
notes
would
improve
the
beer
d
a
bit
heavy
but
good
flavor
slightly
thick
besides
the
underattenuated
nature
of
this
brew
it
has
a
great
nose
and
good
flavor
hf
has
a
good
thing
going
here
they
should
try
and
use
a
different
strand
of
yeast
or
two
yeasts
and
get
this
thing
a
bit
lower
alcohol
heat
is
there
but
not
over
the
top
if
research
serves
correct
this
was
bottled
around
june
12
so
not
a
very
old
bottle
i
would
say
good
to
drink
now
cellarers
thanks
prost76
for
the
opportunity
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
sweet
booze
that
lingers
over
the
vinous
fruits
and
sweet
and
leathery
malt
back
bone
into
a
dry
slightly
spicy
finish
the
barrel
presence
is
much
stronger
than
the
nose
suggests
with
subtle
toasted
oak
vanilla
coconut
and
spicy
whiskey
booziness
for
all
of
the
alcohol
flavor
up
front
its
actually
not
all
that
hot
with
lots
of
sweetness
and
a
complex
malt
backbone
balancing
things
out
it
could
actually
use
some
more
whiskey
flavor
and
heat
to
counter
all
of
the
sweetness
slightly
leathery
but
the
caramel
malt
toffee
and
vinous
dark
fruit
notes
overpower
almost
everything
that
would
suggest
barleywine
slight
bubblegum
character
with
hints
of
grape
raisin
date
and
plum
pretty
tasty
with
a
well
masked
abv
but
its
intensely
sweet
and
lacking
in
balance
also
could
use
more
of
a
spiritbarrel
presence
for
my
liking
this
pours
a
murky
medium
brown
color
with
very
little
head
the
scent
is
sweet
with
tart
fruit
the
taste
is
amazingly
rich
with
sweet
malts
sugar
caramel
vanilla
and
so
much
more
it
drinks
very
smooth
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
you
can
tell
the
alcohol
is
there
but
it
blends
together
nicely
with
the
other
ingredients
a
great
find
and
well
worth
it

the

as
one
of
the
few
beers
to

deservedly
so
this
beer
is
fantastic
the
barleywine
style
that
they
claim
in
their
descriptor
can
be
difficult
to
find
sometimes
especially
if
the
drinker
is
more
accustomed
to
the
more
common
american
barleywine
style
however
as
a
traditional
or
english
barleywine
this
beer
is
a
marvelous
blending
of
styles
it
incorporates
all
the
malty

slightly
syrupy
beer
but
it
never

like
too
much
and
is
never
cloying
overall
bourbon
i
do
like
my
bws
on
the
sweeter
side
less
hoppy
this
is
a
beer
that
has
layers
and
layers
of
complexity
that
one
needs
to
contemplate
before
realizing
how
awesome
it
is
i
feel
like
this
is
a

can

no

i
suspect
this
will
improve
over
the
next
few
months
a
good
job
of
aging
with
the
toffee
really
running
deep
and
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
finally
showing
through
its
clear
this
barleywine
is
still
quite
young
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
the
coffee
in
the
nose
overwhelms
everything
else
the
flavor
is
more
balanced
the
coffee
and
brown
sugar
dominate
the
flavor
but
play
well
together
more
flavors
kick
in
adding
to
the
complexity
sweetness
isnt
usually
something
that
bruery
beers
lack
but
this
happens
to
be
one
of
them
the
coffee
bitterness
goes
nicely
with
the
roast
oak
and
booze
but
i
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
body
to
balance
this
one
out
decent
but
not
great
cold
brewed
coffee
smell
not
too
sweet
balanced
no
one
overt
flavor
rises
above
another
o
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
intense
the
coffee
is
a
very
nice
addition
to
the
beer
the
complexity
is
awesome
and
the
flavors
are
top
notch
the
alcohol
does
start
to
get
a
little
too
forward
after
a
few
drinks
definitely
a
sipper
as
that
keeps
the
alcohol
from
coming
out
too
much
the
roasted
coffee
adds
a
great
finish
to
the
original
mash
very
good
taste
much
better
than
the
original
but
the
coffee
was
a
little
strong
for
my
taste
if
youre
a
huge
coffee
fan
this
is
for
you
because
it
tastes
like
a
really
strong
cup
of
joe
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
the
color
is
a
copper
red
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
little
strong
on
the
bourbon
side
with
a
hint
of
carmel
malt
the
mouth
feel
is
sweet
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
the
favors
are
carmel
malts
dried
fruit
and
pine
there
is
a
bourbon
flavor
in
this
brew
but
its
not
overpowering
the
base
beer
is
much
more
subtle
everything
from
the
wonderful
malts
to
the
barrel
work
in
tandem
but
here
the
coffee
overwhelms
it
is
just
bitter
acrid
coffee
grounds
in
the
finish
starts
out
damn
amazing
and
sadly
fades
into
something
less
than
forgettable
not
sure
id
recommend
25
nice
but
kinda
harsh
flavors
and
drinkability
overall
a
vast
improvement
over
mash
the
coffee
is
a
fantastic
addition
overall
pretty
good
though
not
all
that
special
the
coffee
is
a
little
dominant
in
the
nose
which
slightly
hurts
the
complexity
of
the
regular
barreled
version
and
the
feel
is
still
too
light
and
prickly
to
really
support
whats
going
on
an
interesting
enough
beer
and
a
fun
set
to
try
but
not
something
worth
writing
home
about
really
happy
to
give
them
a
try
though
so
thanks
again

always
fun
o
so
much
coffee
it
totally
dominates
the
entire
beer
a
bit
one
sided
for
my
liking
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
an
interesting
variation
from
the
base
mash
brew
its
deeply
complex
but
the
coffee
addition
is
strangely
dusty
and
spoiled
but
it
works
to
make
the
brew
different
like
mash
this
one
hardly
showcases
the
barrel
aging
which
is
a
bit
of
a
disappontment
a
confounding
beer
that
didnt
quite
reach
expectations
points
for
originality
but
a
tooheavy
hand
on
the
coffee
pummels
whatever
else
might
be
interesting
in
the
beer
to
gone
status
coffee
bourbon
would
have
really
liked
to
see
this
creative
experiment
hit
the
next
level
still
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
lovely
and
impressive
oa
really
good
beer
the
coffee
was
a
great
addition
to
mash
the
bottle
was
already
a
few
months
old
but
it
didnt
seem
like

of
nice
fresh
roasted
coffee
oak
caramel
bourbon
toasted
sugar

earth
the
flavor
is
mostly
the
same
but
doesnt
work
on
quite
the
same
level
definitely
some
warmth
to
this
one
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
toasty
earthy
warming
mouthfeel
nice
barrelaged
coffee
barley
wine
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
a
coffee
ba
barleywine
but
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
retains
the
big
complexity
and
flavors
typical
of
bruery
beers
but
eschews
the
overthetop
sweetness
perhaps
this
shows
a
more
mature
side
of
the
bruery
the
palate
opens
with
a
big
coffee
flavor
earthy
minimally
bitter
moderately
roasty
and
moderately
fruity
along
with
it
is
the
rather
disjointed
base
barleywine
thats
made
much
much
better
with
the
coffee
with
the
vanilla
and
coconut
pairing
well
with
the
fruit
and
the
caramel
working
nicely
with
the
chocolate
as
with
mash
this
beer
does
feel
a
little
watery
on
the
finish
but
again
the
coffee
makes
up
for
it
medium
in
body
lightened
in
part
by
the
appreciable
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
the
finish
has
a
blend
of
coffee
coconut
and
booze
and
as
mentioned
earlier
is
a
touch
watery
solid
stuff
m
medium
to
full
body
light
carbonation
o
good
beer
this
beer
is
in
your
face
coffee
i
appreciate
it
but
many
may
not
i
like
the
bruery
for
their
old
ales
and
barleywines
glad
i
was
able
to
tick
this
thanks

flavors
on
the

there
is
a
mild

roasty

on

with

sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of

with
a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
very
nice
coffee
and
bourbon
presence
that
makes
this
beer
better
than
regular
mash
in
my
opinion
o
very
nicely
done
the
blending
of
the
coffee
with
the
original
beers
toffee
and
chocolate
notes
really
elevates
it
had
the
mash
also
this
coffee
version
is
definitely
better
overall
drinks
pretty
easy
all
things
considered
the
coffee
really
helps
cut
down
the
sweetness
of
an
english
barleywine
its
an
exceptional
brew
o
overall
it
was
to
try
this
and
mash
side
by
side
but
this
beer
is
superior
to
mash
in
every
way
imo
look
aside
i
also
did
as
the
bruery
suggested
and
mixed
this
with
mg
fun
but
i
think
100
mg
is
still
the
best
second
best
was
9010
8020
and
so
on
the
coffee
is
great
in
this
one
hoping
they
do
more
beers
with
coffee
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
one
bottle
into
a
snifter
finally
got
around
to
opening
this
dark
reddish
brown
in
color
i
want
to
call
it
auburn
finger
of
beige
foam
acceptable
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
loaded
with
nutty
toffee
and
coffee
lots
of
cashew
with
some
almond
in
there
as
well
ample
bourbon
with
restrained
brown
sugar
i
get
a
little
vanilla
and
chocolate
as
well
the
coffee
cuts
the
rich
english
barleywine
aroma
the
flavor
is
smooth
with
an
enormous
amount
of
toffee
and
a
balanced
nutty
coffee
profile
earth
abounds
bourbon
is
pervasive
and
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
again
the
coffee
cuts
the
sweetness
making
this
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
calories
oak
is
evident
in
the
bourbon
coffee
toffee
finish
theres
some
warming
and
the
beer
is
sticky
and
smooth
this
beer
is
really
good
and
it
exceeded
my
expectations
the
coffee
is
balancing
and
doesnt
blast
the
base
beer
into
oblivion
i
hope
the
bruery
does
a
coffee
stout
next
year
the
beer
is
darker
than
the
standard
version
with
a
quarter
inch
or
so
of
beige
head
big
coffee
scents
rich
roasted
malt
espresso
coffee
beans
vanilla
oak
toffee
smells
great
huge
coffee
presence
but
still
balanced
robust
and
bold
alcohol
content
well
disguised
a
great
beer
to
sip
and
savor
i
think
this
is
an
improvement
over
the
standard
mash
offering
more
depth
of
flavor
o
really
coffee
forward
beer
barleywine
that
has
a
good
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
the
coffee
fantastic
if
bcbcs
had
a
barleywine
brother
this
would
be
it
delicious
beer
thanks
again
chris
i
was
apprehensive
of
what
coffee
would
do
to
a
barrel
aged
english
barleywine
but
this
just
blew
me
away
im
a
big
fan
of
coffee
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
ever
had
i
really
enjoyed
the
base
mash
and
the
addition
of
coffee
makes
it
stand
out
this
is
well
worth
a
try
t
upfront
theres
a
good
amount
of
earthy
coffee
toffee
and
spicy
earthy
hops
caramel
bourbon
vanilla
and
some
booze
sneak
in
at
the
finish
i
really
like
this
one
but
i
think
im
one
of
the
few
who
prefer
standard
mash
to
this
still
another
fantastic
beer
from
the
bruery
overall
interesting
but
not
phenomenal
not
as
good
as
the
original
i
think
which
had
a
lot
more
beer
character
i
like
the
coffee
addition
but
again
just
wish
there
was
more
beer
profile
balance
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
coffee
kind
of
took
away
from
the
base
barleywine
too
much
still
a
tasty
beer
edit
after
it
warms
up
quite
abit
more
coffee
comes
through
beer
pours
nicely
with
a
full
finger
head
which
dissipates
into
a
faint
off
white
collar
that
sits
cleanly
against
the
rim
the
beer
smells
amazing
i
love
coffee
and
this
is
a
coffee
lovers
dream
there
is
a
tickle
of
caramel
and
bourbon
but
the
coffee
forward
nose
is
spicy
and
floral
tastes
very
close
to
the
nose
imagine
your
best
cup
of
coffee
and
using
caramel
and
bourbon
as
your
creamer
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
creamy
exactly
how
this
beer
should
come
across
i
cant
fault
this
beer
in
any
way
im
happy
i
secured
a
few
more
of
these
hoard
if
you
have
a
chance
o
a
surprising
delight
i
didnt
expect
coffee
in
a
barleywine
to
be
a
home
run
but
in
this
case
it
really
accentuates
the
base
beer
taking
it
to
the
next
level
i
will
happily
enjoy
the
second
bottle
of
this
that
i
have
stashed
away
4
oz
pour
off
tap
into
tasting
snifter
at
bruery
tasting
room
on
19dec14
gfunk
o
very
impressed
with
this
one
may
need
to
get
some
more
not
sure
i
get
much
barleywine
character
in
this
but
the
coffee
element
is
so
fantastic
i
didnt
miss
it
o
im
really
impressed
with
this
beer
bcbcs
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
and
mg
can
hang
i
opened
this
poured
a
full
glass
and
sipped
about
half
before
ordering
an
additional
four
more
of
these
bottles
from
the
bruery
at
around
17
in
my
opinion
its
worth
every
penny
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
coffee
that
nutty
slightly
bitter
thing
this
is
your
beer
i
have
to
imagine
the
bw
elements
come
through
after
the
coffee
mellows
probably
why
the
bruery
said
best
fresh
overall
when
the
bruery
announced
this
beer
i
wondered
how
it
would
stack
up
to
abacus
my
english
barleywine
standard
im
liking
this
coffee
infused
version
the
barrel
doesnt
feature
as
much
in
this
one
but
the
coffee
addition
and
good
taste
profile
work
for
me
looking
forward
to
the
regular
mash
i
love
the
bruery
and
in
theory
this
one
is
right
up
my
alley
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
nearly
2
years
old
this
was
exceptionally
smooth
full
of
barrel
character
and
gorgeously
blended
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
notes
and
not
overly
sweet
excellent
beer
hazy
light
brown
pour
with
a
thin
layer
of
white
bubbles
on
top
in
the
aroma
wood
toasted
cereal
grains
caramel
rusty
metal
a
lot
of
barrel
in
the
taste
almost
too
much
very
woody
grainy
malts
stale
bready
sugars
body
was
lightmedium
just
not
what
im
interested
in
for
the
style
overall
the
first
sip
threw
me
for
a
loop
but
after
that
it
settled
down
into
a
great
beer
o
overall
i
feel
that
mash
grind
is
a
better
beer
it
has
more
complexity
and
while
the
base
is
really
good
it
doesnt
seem
to
quite
be
able
to
stand
up
on
its
own
and
for
the
price
it
should
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
good
and
the
flavors
are
rock
solid
though
this
beer
is
definitely
one
to
sip
throughout
an
evening
the
grind
version
had
so
much
more
complexity
it
seemed
huge
coconut
cream
pie
flavors
just
awesome
o
man
this
is
a
hell
of
an
english
barleywine
the
aroma
is
incredible
the
flavors
not
quite
matching
up
i
would
love
to
cellar
this
and
revisit
in
a
couple
years
as
it
mellows
and
evolves
an
interesting
and
ambitious
brew
with
a
lot
going
on
but
the
fruity
estery
aspect
arent
aligned
enough
with
the
base
flavors
for
this
to
be
knockyouonyourass
delicious
a
spot
on
english
barleywine
with
a
subtle
barrel
character
really
warm
and
comforting
well
done
and
highly
recommended
eh
theres
just
something
not
hitting
me
right
its
a
good
beer
just
not
a
memorable
one
i
wont
seek
again
20
aroma
is
just
flatout
too
much
and
unmelded
too
english
of
an
english
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
wellbalanced
barleywine
the
barrel
is
nice
and
the
base
beer
holds
its
own
underneath
unfortunately
the
feel
is
too
light
and
prickly
for
the
style
which
hurts
the
experience
overall
but
besides
that
issue
this
is
a
quality
beer
worth
checking
out
cheers
claaark13
o
sweet
and
nice
a
touch
of
heat
in
the
back
end
but
i
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
nice
barleywine
with
solid
balance
between
malt
alcohol
and
hops
admittedly
i
drank
this
entire
bottle
myself
and
only
while
pouring
the
last
glass
did
i
read
that
this
was
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
by
no
means
is
the
barrel
aging
obvious
mash
might
be
neither
my
favorite
english
barleywine
nor
my
favorite
from
the
bruery
but
its
really
freakin
good
a
boozy
sweet
treat
that
it
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
oa
good
ba
barleywine
but
nowhere
near
abacus
and
the
like
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
bourbon
and
sweetness
and
washes
that
up
with
some
oak
as
disjointed
as
the
nose
was
the
palates
worse
a
pleasant
enough
barrel
character
is
present
with
vanilla
coconut
and
overbearing
oak
toffee
burnt
caramel
and
a
moderate
fruitiness
are
present
on
the
midpalate
i
cant
understate
how
disappointing
the
finish
is
boozy
tannic
and
disappointingly
watery
there
is
very
little
redeeming
about
this
aspect
the
wateriness
alone
makes
me
dump
the
entire
damn
thing
theres
some
lingering
floral
and
coconut
present
medium
in
body
with
a
slick
carbonation
this
is
rather
disappointing
m
full
bodies
thick
and
viscous
light
carbonation
m
full
bodied
beer
fairly
chewy
thinner
than
i
guess
i
was
expecting
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
bourbon
wood
and
slight
metallic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
slight
metallic
aroma
i
am
getting
is
odd
i
also
did
as
the
bruery
suggested
and
mixed
this
with
mg
fun
but
i
think
100
mg
is
still
the
best
o
overall
this
is
a
well
put
together
english
barleywine
which
is
one
of
my
more
preferred
styles
it
doesnt
have
the
overwhelming
hops
of
some
of
the
stronger
barleywines
out
there
and
can
be
sipped
lightly
while
enjoying
the
malt
complexities
i
think
they
could
even
kick
this
up
a
notch
in
abv
with
how
this
finished
so
dry
id
drink
it
again
the
beer
is
light
brown
with
a
touch
of
crimson
small
beige
head
that
settles
around
18
inch
the
aroma
brings
bourbon
malt
toffee
caramels
burnt
sugar
oak
nice
flavor
following
the
aroma
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
in
the
finish
but
really
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
the
most
part
a
really
nice
brew
to
sip
and
savor
solid
overall
quite
nice
good
malt
character
although
could
have
used
a
bit
more
complexity
nice
hop
character
for
an
english
barleywine
booze
is
hidden
well
nice
bourbon
barrel
characters
all
around
decent
beer
o
overall
this
was
a
booze
bomb
bourbon
goodness
overall
good
beer
that
i
feel
a
little
age
may
do
it
good
overall
yet
another
bourbon
brown
sugar
bomb
from
the
bruery
this
one
is
tiring
though
o
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
but
i
think
it
needs
a
bit
of
time
for
the
alcohol
to
mellow
the
nose
left
me
wanting
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
t
very
sweet
upfront
with
notes
of
caramel
datemolasses
raisin
burnt
marshmallow
and
bourbon
finish
brings
some
light
oak
and
a
touch
of
dryness
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
which
was
a
little
offputting
for
me
other
than
that
this
is
really
nice
almost
tart
perfectly
mellow
with
a
backend
of
alcohol
when
im
not
skiing
the
alps
i
always
try
to
let
it
warm
this
reminded
me
of
a
candied
apple
this
beer
was
incredibly
good
especially
with
time
one
day
this
will
come
in
a
bomber
for
50
and
we
will
all
be

poured
into

glass
drank
over
30
minutes
a
very
nice
after
dinner
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
i
was
excited
to
try
this
but
twas
a
fail
this
is
mighty
tasty
as
it
warms
up
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
appreciated
that
i
could
slowly
sip
it
like
a
harder
liquor
savoring
it
for
over
an
hour
o
great
beer
glad
some
of
my
ba
friends
got
me
to
start
trying
more
barleywines
and
other
strongold
ales
prost
overall
almost
a
great
beer
i
love
the
way
the
calvados
pervades
every
aspect
of
this
beer
but
still
allows
the
subtle
complexity
of
the
other
notes
to
come
through
definitely
worth
a
try
and
something
i
would
buy
again
o
this
beer
comes
together
excellently
and
i
consider
it
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts

the

tangy
fruit
with
a
mix
of
spice
and
oak
adding
to
the
light
caramel
and
malt
with
slight
vanilla
earthy
character
the
vinous
flavor
is
there
with
subtle
alcohol
making
for
a
splendid
barleywine
overall
i
had
a
hard
time
keeping
myself
from
downing
this
it
is
so
flavorful
however
it
evolves
as
it
warms
and
opens
up
to
an
even
more
complex
strong
ale
over
the
course
of
tasting
when
it
nears
cellar
tempsworth
every
cent
a
truly
remarkable
beer
overall
a
great
sipper
pour
it
in
a
snifter

this

overall
tasty
if
lacking

this

doesnt

style
great

of

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
this
is
a
nice
dessert
beer
and
requires
slow
sipping
but
is
quite
enjoyable
and
the
calvados
flavors
really
come
through
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
it
is
really
delicious
right
now
caramel
apple
brandy
some
nice
spices
and
plenty
of
sweet
fruit
i
have
to
guess
that
the
time
in
the
bottle
has
done
great
things
with
this
because
it
is
drinking
really
well
right
now
this
is
a
really
good
desert
type
drink
bottle
that
says
brewed
in
2006
pours
brownish
reddish
toffee
color
with
no
head
and
lots
of
sediment
floating
around
aroma
of
biscuits
toffee
caramel
vanilla
licorice
some
chocolate
nice
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
like
whoah
then
fades
into
an
intense
praline
nuttiness
and
vanilla
cream
the
nutty
flavor
lingers
a
good
while
and
is
very
pleasantprobably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
the
up
front
super
cloying
maple
sweet
makes
it
tough
to
drink
at
start
but
otherwise
a
nicely
layered
bunch
of
flavors
brown
sugar
figs
and
chocolate
begin
to
show
calvados
and
butterscotch
come
out
as
it
warms
thick
and
viscous
heavy
decadent
dessert
beer
for
sure
maybe
a
bit
much
but
definitely
had
the
depth
of
flavor
the
palate
improves
as
i
go
and
overall
one
to
try
for
barleywine
lovers
one
of
the
most
complex
flavor
profiles
i
have
come
across
since
bb4d
overall
this
is
a
special
occasion
beer
given
the
price
but
wow
does
this
impress
so
smooth
its
not
often
you
can
find
beer
aged
for
several
years
at
my
local
stores
the
calvados
casks
really
come
through
on
this
one
and
create
a
truly
flavorful
balanced
amazingly
smooth
beer
will
buy
again
if
you
like
any
sort
of
oak
bourbon
or
other
barrel
aged
beer
you
will
absolutely
love
this
o
worth
the
buy
but
not
as
stunning
as
id
hoped
very
sweet
very
slick
apple
predominant
on
the
nose
an
on
the
palate
invisible
alcohol
content
o
i
would
enjoy
it
more
if
it
were
called
something
else
resembles
the
cask
it
was
aged
in
ather
than
a
barley
however
in
its
favor
its
insanely
complex
its
flat
despite
my
most
aggressive
pour
ever
smells
and
tastes
pretty
woody
and
sort
of
reminiscent
of
port
it
tastes
malty
and
is
fine
but
is
missing
something
is
missing
life
or
soul
or
body
or
complexity
the
residual
warmth
at
the
end
is
welcome
but
doesnt
save
it
brewed
in
2007
o
classy
stuff
not
something
youd
drink
in
the
pub
overall
i
wish
i
could
have
had
this
bottle
a
year
or
two
ago
before
the
oxidization
became
noticeable
in
the
nose
that
said
it
is
still
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
i
hope
to
have
again
overall
its
quite
an
experience
and
totally
worth
the
price
of
admission
even
though
its
not
like
most
barleywine
its
still
quite
tasty
worth
picking
up
for
12
bucks
though
retail
hell
no
o
a
fantastic
barleywine
that
goes
from
very
good
at
cellar
temp
to
unbelievable
at
room
temperature
overall
a
really
interesting
beer
the
calvados
flavor
almost
makes
it
feel
like
some
brett
is
present
thanks
to
the
rotten
apple
notes
it
imparts
glad
i
tried
it
but
definitely
wont
pay
that
much
for
a
tiny
bottle
again
incredibly
sweet
and
incredibly
smooth
extremely
complex
and
unique
absolutely
no
hint
of
the
11
5
abv
i
will
certainly
be
trying
some
other
barrels
o
like
their
regular
version
better
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
barleywine
the
worcestershire
sauce
taste
throws
this
whole
beer
off
for
me
on
tap
at
trappeze
poured
into
a
southern
tier

oily

bright

suprisingly

nice

sweetness
mango
swedish
fish
and
vanilla
in
the
background
very
smooth
to
drink
for
the
abv
no
doubt
the
calvados
has
completely
muted
the
alcohol
from
the
taste
completely
awesome

a
dark

a
somewhat
too
aggressive

left
dark
yeast

at

inviting
aroma
of

and
alcohol
flavor
is
caramel
intense
apple
juice
dark
dried

hint
of
vanilla
quite
sweet
but
the
intensity
of
flavor
makes
this
very
drinkable
medium
to
heavy
bodied
just
short
of
syrupy
delicious
apple
flavors
in
this
classic
english
barleywine
too
drinkable
for
its
11
abv
i
will
have
to
age
a
few
of
these
o
this
was
really
good
i
preferred
this
one
to
an
08
bottle
that
was
not
aged
in
any
barrels
overall
an
improvement
over
the
base
anything
that
distracts
from
the
sugar
is
a
welcome
maybe
its
the
age
that
makes
it
seem
less
sweet
im
not
sure
note
2011
vintage
o
a
pretty
insane
english
style
barleywine
the
brandy
helps
cut
the
syrup
but
at
the
same
time
i
feel
like
it
lost
a
lot
of
complexity
of
the
normal
nonbarrel
aged
version
o
not
very
pleasant
to
drink
horrible
appearance
and
mouthfeel
and
tastes
mostly
like
brandy
might
as
well
buy
a
bottle
of
calvados
really
nice
beer
d
very
drinkable
the
calvados
adds
some
nice
fruity
sweetness
on
top
of
the
base
beer
and
the
overall
beer
is
nice
and
bold
but
stays
fairly
balanced
an
excellent
bw
from
jw
lees
which
is
to
be
expected
not
sure
its
such
a
great
idea
to
feature
it
during
the
summer
in
baltimore
they
had
three
different
versions
in
fact
and
they
did
not
seem
to
be
moving
but
regardless
this
is
another
very
good
bw
from
this
excellent
brewery
o
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
with
this
beer
but
the
sweetness
most
definitately
took
me
by
surprise
this
was
rather
easy
for
me
to
get
through
the
entire
bottle
even
though
it
is
so
sweet
like
candy
overall
the
beer
is
just
too
sweet
to
me
even
for
an
english
barleywine
omy
new
favorite
with
any
vintage
i
have
2000
to
2009
now
and
all
are
stellar
o
celebrating
my
300th
review
with
a
doozy
a
topnotch
barleywine
overall
a
very
great
execution
but
not
a
beer
for
me
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
one
can
certainly
argue
that
it
is
more
barrel
than
beer
the
calvados
aging
has
a
dramatic
impact
and
threatens
to
overpower
the
base
beer
personally
i
think
the
result
is
very
nice
but
could
understand
somebody
being
dissatisfied
with
the
result
i
found
that
it
got
less
enjoyable
as
i
went
on
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
even
the
smaller
bottle
was
a
bit
hard
to
finish
one
of
the
better
variants
of
this
brew
and
age
does
this
one
well
o
amazing
beer
tomorrow
i
will
be
going
back
to
buy
the
other
6
bottles
this
is
not
a
everyday
drinking
beer
or
one
to
have
with
a
meal
this
is
a
beer
where
you
put
some
rhythmic
mood
music
on
turn
down
the
lights
sip
and
savor
enjoy
every
nounce
of
the
beer
this
is
very
good
but
2008
was
better
seems
like
3
to
4
years
is
perfect
but
that
is
judging
from
only
two
data
points
so
far
i
still
have
more
setting
and
waiting
d
thus
far
i
have
far
preferred
the
port
cask
version
over
the
rest
but
this
might
be
better
if
not
a
very
close
second
for
me
in
the
jw
lees
barrel
variations
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
a
slight
haze
and
ring
lovely
aromas
of
sweet
toffee
malt
caramel
and
apple
brandy
i
happen
to
love
a
good
calvados
so
this
is
hitting
me
just
right
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
and
sweet
definitely
sweeter
then
the
regular
version
with
rich
flavors
of
apple
caramel
toffee
and
toasted
malt
bottle
has
aged
well
getting
just
the
slightest
touch
of
oxidation
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
sweet
quite
smooth
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
low
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
treatment
of
j
w
lees
im
digging
it
a
bit
more
then
the
sherry
version
we
had
alongside
it
poured
from
a
9
3
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
yeasty
apricot
color
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
with
yeast
chunks
in
the
bottom
it
smells
of
a
weird
mixture
of
baby
aspirin
apple
juice
and
sherry
the
taste
is
surprising
its
syrupy
sweet
with
a
soft
smokey
oak
flavor
with
a
definite
sherry
backnote
aftertaste
is
like
smoked
cotton
candy
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
fizzy
with
slight
carbonation
alcohol
is
present
but
completely
befuddling
and
unnoticeable
therefore
dangerous
its
the
weirdest
barleywine
and
one
of
the
strangest
beers
ive
ever
tried
i
think
i
like
it
i
think
im
not
sure
id
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
likes
really
odd
flavored
beers
notes
3
down
1
to
go
these
jwl
cask
aged
barleywines
are
not
working
for
me
o
this
is
not
a
horrible
barrelaged
ale
but
it
isnt
my
favorite
either
in
fact
this
may
be
my
least
favorite
version
of
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
its
just
too
sweet
and
too
syrupy
for
my
taste
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barley
wine
that
is
perfect
for
just
sipping
on
woah
little
oak
cask
2009
batch
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
no
head
nose
is
way
more
apple
than
i
expected
the
beer
seems
to
have
become
one
with
the
calvados
lots
of
caramel
apple
and
slightly
oxidized
in
a
good
way
its
like
theres
a
bit
of
an
apple
jacksoutofthebox
note
its
also
heavily
alcoholic
but
not
offensively
so
or
solventy
just
definitely
boozy
hints
of
hops
earth
jam
and
other
fruits
as
well
taste
is
a
full
bodied
slick
wellbalanced
blast
of
all
of
the
above
with
an
apple
jacks
back
end
and
a
cleansing
heat
the
apple
fits
very
well
here
and
doesnt
even
come
close
to
translating
as
an
off
character
a
monster
beer
chewy
and
quite
similar
to
the
standard
barrel
aging
seems
to
impart
little
to
this
beer
from
what
ive
seen
which
is
already
chewy
and
very
sweet
with
caramel
and
faint
not
sure
what
calvados
is
like
anyway
but
this
remains
as
tasty
as
the
original
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
with
a
medium
finish
this
is
exactly
opposite
of
what
i
thought
that
this
beer
would
be
from
a
stand
point
of
a
ba
this
beer
lacks
so
much
finesse
and
carbonation
that
is
makes
it
worthless
to
drink
not
a
very
good
showing
o
time
has
been
good
to
this
one
still
drinking
nicely
at
six
years
old
but
i
wouldnt
let
it
go
more
than
another
year
or
two
good
sugary
old
j
w
lees
is
a
sweet
drink
to
begin
with
and
i
think
the
aging
in
a
fruity
brandy
cask
might
compound
the
sugars
too
much
o
i
had
a
6oz
pour
which
usually
is
not
enough
for
me
but
it
was
perfect
the
beer
was
so
thick
rich
and
flavorful
that
i
sipped
it
the
whole
way
never
wanting
to
take
more
than
a
taste
but
enjoying
every
one
o
this
beer
was
awesome
i
wish
i
bought
more
than
just
one
bottle
of
this
and
then
didnt
share
it
with
a
friend
as
well
the
taste
is
very
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
if
your
able
to
find
this
grab
it
up
i
imagine
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
within
12
years
this
is
the
2006
version
of
this
beer
even
with
a
very
vigorous
pour
there
is
no
head
on
this
beer
at
all
it
is
a
nice
mahogany
color
and
is
mildly
cloudy
with
a
few
floaties
i
could
have
done
without
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
honey
in
it
and
some
apple
and
some
sweet
caramel
the
flavor
is
nicer
a
bit
syrupy
without
the
carbonation
but
there
is
a
nice
floral
blend
of
apple
and
some
wood
and
malt
in
the
background
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
it
is
very
smooth
definitely
a
sipper
because
of
the
sweetness
and
body
i
dont
know
if
the
sweetness
comes
from
the
base
beer
or
the
calvados
either
way
it
is
close
to
being
too
much
very
heavy
beer
that
is
pretty
much
still
i
do
not
expect
a
high
level
of
carbonation
in
a
beer
like
this
but
some
might
have
been
nice
to
cut
some
of
the
sweetness
an
interesting
pairing
between
a
barleywine
and
apple
brandy
that
i
think
could
have
gone
better
slightly
syrupy
low
carbonation
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
should
remain
a
sipper
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
be
paired
with
a
desert
after
an
awesome
meal
this
was
the
first
one
of
the
four
that
i
tried
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
thick
looking
amberish
orange
color
the
head
was
only
visible
for
a
minute
or
so
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
full
of
fresh
wooden
aromas
sweet
malts
and
booze
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
earthy
with
plenty
of
wooden
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
brew
is
very
big
despite
the
smaller
bottle
these
could
be
sold
at
8
5oz
and
theyd
be
plenty
big
worth
trying
for
sure
very
nice
stuff
o
if
this
wasnt
so
hard
to
find
and
so
expensive
id
drink
it
all
the
time
mouthfeel
much
more
cloying
than
the
sherry
cask
but
a
little
less
than
the
regular
depending
on
year
not
my
favorite
of
jws
but
also
really
enjoyable
and
im
sure
ill
have
it
again

128th
2006
vintage
this
beer
pours
a
syrupy
dark
maple
brown
in
color
with
no
head
at
all
and
seemingly
little
carbonation
a
good
amount
of
sediment
slipped
into
my
snifter
and
resembles
clumps
of
cinnamon
floating
throughout
my
glass
it
is
very
aromatic
and
gives
of
aromas
of
apples
caramel
oak
vanilla
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
and
maple
syrup
the
nose
is
phenomenal
and
heavy
on
the
caramelized
apples
the
flavors
given
are
of
sweet
apples
cinnamon
sticks
oak
tree
bark
vanilla
and
caramel
it
is
very
very
sweet
and
also
quite
syrupy
it
drinks
syrupy
and
medium
in
body
and
has
almost
lost
all
of
its
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
a
sipper
or
to
be
shared
and
could
be
defined
as
a
dessert
beer
at
this
stage
in
its
life
its
a
fine
drinker
and
i
prefer
this
to
the
sherry
cask
version
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
to
open
again
in
another
couple
years
its
a
good
english
barleywine
overall
this
was
not
nearly
as
wonderful
as
i
had
imagined
after
my
brief
love
affair
with
de
regenborg
at
monks
cafe
i
assumed
calvados
could
only
improve
the
right
beer
in
this
case
i
am
wishing
i
had
opted
for
the
whiskey
scotch
or
port
barrel
version
of
this
beer
lately
anything
calvados
related
intrigues
me
this
version
of
jw
lees
pours
a
really
pretty
rose
color
with
a
quick
to
fade
white
head
the
nose
is
very
sweet
with
lots
of
apples
alcohol
honeydew
and
peach
nectar
the
flavor
follows
the
same
example
as
far
as
sweetness
almost
to
the
point
of
being
cloying
while
this
is
a
boozy
beer
the
alcohol
doesnt
necessarily
hinder
the
experience
overall
mouthfeel
is
a
highlight
here
in
that
it
is
very
smooth
and
not
too
heavy
this
is
certainly
a
sipper
but
a
light
one
while
the
ten
dollar
price
tag
is
on
the
steep
side
for
a
bottle
of
its
size
i
recommend
this
beer
i
paired
some
bitter
chimay
cheese
with
it
which
helped
to
cut
down
on
the
sweetness
i
imagine
the
salty
nature
of
stilton
would
pair
nicely
as
well
follow
up
to
the
j
w
lees
harvest
2000
vintage
bottle
poured
from
2008
vintage
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
a
mostly
clear
medium
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
malt
calvados
sherry
and
spice
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
malt
notes
oak
spice
calvados
and
sherrylike
oxidative
notes
slick
on
the
mouthfeel
with
medium
body
and
soft
carbonation
overall
i
preferred
this
over
the
harvest
2000
vintage
i
had
previously
a
definite
sipper
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
an
acceptably
very
low
level
of
carbonation
clingy
sweetness
sticks
to
your
tongue
with
this
and
mixes
with
lots
of
oxidative
quality
its
a
well
made
old
aleenglish
barleywine
with
good
balance
and
enjoyable
for
11
ive
been
on
an
apple
brandy
barrel
aged
beer
kick
lately
and
really
enjoy
the
normal
harvest
offering
but
this
fell
a
little
short
for
me
i
think
my
expectations
were
a
bit
too
high
considering
how
much
i
like
the
base
beer
big
icewine
sweetness
with
a
major
apple
component
alcohol
plays
a
main
role
but
smooth
enough
to
make
it
a
delectable
sipper
burnt
edges
like
a
flaming
campfire
marshmallow
and
the
whole
sherryfunguswood
complexities
are
ridiculous
the
alcohol
flavors
even
seem
to
have
various
levels
of
flavor
crazy
beer
definitely
malt
driven
with
caramel
simple
syrup
and
toast
omnipresent
nice
beer
very
fun
to
drink
drink
this
was
a
very
good
barleywine
it
was
balanced
and
creamy
and
boozy
yet
at
the
same
time
tame
and
delicate
i
cant
wait
to
have
again
and
try
the
other
variations
overall
i
have
always
enjoyed
these
barrel
agings
in
this
one
is
tied
with
the
sherry
imo
cheers
finally
decided
to
pull
a
2005
vintage
from
the
cellar
and
apparently
i
had
waited
too
long
good
cap
seal
but
almost
no
carbonation
a
substantial
bit
of
brown
sediment
decanted
even
with
a
careful
pour
very
sweet
with
caramel
and
red
delicious
apple
notes
once
the
initial
sweetness
passed
there
really
seemed
nothing
of
note
backing
it
up
other
than
a
touch
of
alcohol
harshness
perhaps
a
more
fresh
sample
would
be
a
better
representation
but
i
can
only
judge
the
merit
of
the
beer
by
what
is
in
my
glass
at
the
moment
highly
recommended
on
gravity
cask
at
the
ginger
man
as
expected
it
came
out
a
hazy
red
without
a
head
or
carbonation
there
was
a
big
caramel
apple
pie
aroma
with
slight
hints
of
oxidation
not
detrimental
the
calvados
imparts
an
earthy
fruit
charcter
that
blends
nicely
with
the
rich
caramel
malt
and
hint
of
peppery
hops
my
only
complaint
was
that
the
mouthfeel
was
a
liitle
grainy
at
the
end
like
there
were
bits
if
trub
or
something
from
the
bottom
of
the
cask
this
simply
glides
over
the
tongue
and
coats
your
taste
buds
in
a
creamy
fashion
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
an
unexpectedly
dry
finish
certainly
take
your
time
with
this
brew
and
enjoy
each
sip
very
drinkable
and
the
11
5abv
is
certainly
unnoticeable
in
any
harsh
or
derogatory
manner
the
warmer
sensation
as
you
drink
is
welcoming
on
such
a
cold
snowy
night
i
am
not
a
brandy
drinker
but
i
may
need
to
start
after
this
wonder
experience
the
barrel
adds
some
weird
tequila
flavours
sweet
almost
wine
like
characteristics
as
well
unusual
to
say
the
least
different
and
worth
a
try
d
i
found
the
3
normal
vintages
very
sweet
and
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
the
apple
brandy
barrels
definitely
smoothed
this
one
out
and
made
it
easier
to
drink
would
have
again
but
might
have
to
split
a
bottle
with
someone
d
given
the
abv
i
couldnt
have
alot
of
these
its
a
delicious
warming
beer
though
and
worth
a
drink
id
never
turn
one
down
d
this
08
bottle
is
very
mellow
and
the
time
it
spent
it
the
cask
has
done
this
brew
very
good
not
nearly
as
hot
as
i
had
expected
and
quite
the
treat
on
this
xmas
morn
yeah
a
very
heavy
beer
thick
and
rich
like
cottees
topping
a
bit
too
much
to
have
one
whole
bottle
methinks
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
a
friend
i
thought
it
was
delicious
brew
an
incredibly
flavoursome
beverage
that
i
feel
privileged
to
have
tried
poured
into
a
snifter
the
body
is
a
fairlybright
yet
still
murky
orangish
color
with
a
thin
light
head
that
persists
for
a
bit
of
time
before
fading
the
nose
brings
a
good
dose
of
booze
and
the
brandy
comes
through
quite
well
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
plus
some
light
fruits
the
taste
is
just
a
bit
boozy
and
also
has
a
tiny
bit
of
astringency
feel
is
a
bit
boozy
with
a
nice
body
overall
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
original
definitely
not
a
weak
brew
you
can
really
get
the
flavors
of
the
calvados
cask
there
is
also
an
earthy
flavor
that
reminds
me
slightly
of
dirt
d
quite
a
treat
but
an
eveningending
sipper
for
certain
a
fine
one
to
try
not
really
an
occasion
beer
unless
that
occasion
is
the
end
of
a
weekend
spent
camping
and
tasting
freshhopped
beers
leading
into
another
work
week
woo
hoo
still
a
wonderful
sipper
and
just
right
for
that
i
will
say
this
has
a
touch
less
alcohol
that
the
normal
version
but
im
not
sure
that
in
this
case
it
really
matters
very
enjoyable
as
jw
lees
beers
tend
to
be
drinkability
more
like
a
liqueur
than
a
beer
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
reduces
it
to
a
sipper
that
is
hard
to
finish
as
the
other
beers
in
this
series
have
been
much
more
rewarding
i
will
need
to
revisit
this
one
with
a
bottle
procured
from
another
source
poured
a
dark
gold
colour
with
orange
highlights
and
no
head
the
nose
was
full
of
apples
and
vanilla
coupled
with
hops
i
felt
a
little
let
down
by
the
finish
of
the
beer
as
it
was
a
little
sweet
and
the
apple
notes
kinda
clashed
with
the
hops
i
would
put
this
one
down
for
a
good
5
years
to
see
what
develops
as
it
seems
unbalanced
right
now
not
something
you
could
drink
lots
of
but
a
great
experience
overall
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
ive
ever
had
which
would
probably
limit
me
to
sipping
12
glasses
still
a
very
tasty
beer
with
plenty
of
depth
that
is
worth
having
anytime
the
opportunity

the

with

wow
the

more
from

with

some

there
is
a

that
keeps
the

in
check
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
the
feel
borders
on
syrupy
just
not
quite
there
is
the
slightest
of
tingly

definitely
sweet
on
the
palate
but
the
9
3oz

should
stay
not
cloying
a
very
tasty
brew
honestly
very
good
for
the
style
but
i
am
just
not
that
big
of
a
fan
feel
free
to
raise
a
letter
grade
for

flavor
is
similar
to
the
other
jw
lee
harvest
beers
full
bodied
very
sweet
slightly
boozy
and
warm
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
malty
carbonation
is
mild
but
just
enough
to
not
hurt
the
overall
experience
the
sweet
flavors
are
full
of
candy
and
overripe
fruit
raisins
dates
etc
overall
another
solid
beer
in
jw
lees
line
up
of
ba
harvest
series
an
interesting
english
bw
i
liked
it
better
than
the
regular
just
slightly
notes
im
not
sure
how
the
calvados
comes
across
it
has
been
a
long
while
since
i
had
any
so
i
need
to
revisit
it
but
it
is
a
rather
nice
touch
to
the
harvest
ale
overtly
sweet
and
boozy
but
a
pleasing
sipper
fullbodied
very
viscous
this
is
about
as
complex
a
beer
as
ive
encountered
before
extremely
tasty
the
flavors
are
noticeably
separate
but
still
seemingly
blended
well
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
to
buy
more
overall
this
is
a
great
addition
to
the
already
excellent
harvest
ale
lots
of
apple
notes
id
love
to
find
some
older
vintages
of
this
or
a
few
more

to
lay
down
for

is

in
a

absolutely
in
love
with
this
beer
big

winner
taste
follows
nose
a
quick
hit
of
alcohol
then
a
nice
caramel
cooking
apple
mush
and
vanilla
then
not
much
of
anything
it
is
very
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
nicely
yet
its
just
a
bit
odd
to
me
if
they
hadnt
used
calvados
barrels
i
think
this
beer
would
be
average
at
best
d
if
one
can
not
tell
already
i
loved
this
beer
everything
came
together
on
this
one
wish
i
had
more
to
age
but
i
dont
think
id
be
able
to
keep
my
hands
off
them
grab
a
wedge
of
stilton
and
go
to
heaven
d
undeniably
good
and
unique
but
for
me
the
barrel
aging
is
a
bit
too
much
in
front
of
the
flavor
of
a
barleywine
that
is
really
good
by
itself
just
had
a
bottle
of
the
2007
vintage
and
its
definitely
holding
up
well
although
theres
little
to
no
carbonation
it
needs
to
be
poured
carefully
as
there
is
a
lot
of
sediment
so
dont
expect
anything
resembling
a
head
on
this
beer
overall
i
have
to
be
honest
and
say
i
didnt
know
what
calvados
was
and
couldnt
tell
100
from
the
beer
however
now
it
makes
perfect
sense
the
third
one
ive
had
besides
laguvalin
and
port
and
my
least
favorite
but
even
so
its
still
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
shot
d
for
a
bw
at
11
5
this
thing
is
dangerously
smooth
but
the
heaviness
and
booze
make
this
a
sipper
delicious
while
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
hyperhopped
barley
wines
i
thought
this
one
could
have
used
a
little
more
dimension
to
its
flavor
as
it
was
overmuch
sweet
d
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
brew
of
its
potency
drink
with
care
and
appreciation
not
as
stellar
as
the
2003
vintage
but
great
nonetheless
d
this
tasted
fantastic
even
relatively
young
as
compared
to
the
regular
2006
which
i
found
cloying
and
sweet
the
calvados
cask
aging
does
wonders
for
this
one
id
love
to
see
how
it
ages
with
an
older
vintage
md
full
bodied
carbonation
is
low
alcohol
character
is
minimal
but
there
drinkability
is
fine
a
big
beer
that
i
can
enjoy
a
few
of
very
good
beer
from
top
to
bottom
poured
into
a
chalice
a
very
nice
cloudy
light
brown
color
nice

fizzy

with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the

notes
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
some

medium

very
drinkable
this
is
one
fine
brew
highly
recommended
d
as
i
said
before
this
is
a
sipping
beer
finishing
a
full
bottle
is
a
slow
experience
to
be
savored
all
in
all
a
great
barleywine
md
amazingly
smooth
like
liquid
velvet
no
harshness
the
high
abv
is
hidden
well
its
not
overlysickly
sweet
just
in
all
ways
absolutely
amazing
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
one
of
the
best
representations
od
the
style
i
have
had
i
will
be
picking
this
up
whenever
i
run
into
it
for
sure
drinkability
the
best
of
the
bunch
i
have
had
so
far
overall
the
smoothest
and
best
flavors
j
w

calvados
cask
is
the
third
member
of
this
barrelaged
series
that
ive
reviewed
and
is
the
third
gobsmacker
of
an
english
barleywine
despite
the
expense
multiple
bottles
are
purchased
whenever
i
see
them
theyre
incredibly
good
and
they
hold
up
ridiculously
well
highly
recommended
taste
very
sweet
brown

and
apples
are
present
little
bit
of
alcohol
bite
on
the
finish
too
much
apple
and
not
enough
barleywine
in
my
opinion
pours
orangegold
with
virtually
no
head
nose
is
richly
sweet
with
apricots
apple
and
honeydew
palate
is
syrupy
in
texture
somewhat
ciderlike
but
thicker
with
a
very
warm
alcoholic
cough
medicine
like
finish
interesting
experimental
ale
not
sure
if
it
is
worth
seeking
to
try
however
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
which
is
what
im
using
it
as
after
a
delicious
meal
while
one
can
gripe
about
its
small
size
versus
its
price
i
think
a
larger
bottle
of
this
beer
might
be
too
much
of
a
good
thing
i
only
wish
i
had
an
older
bottle
to

a
fair
amount
of

flavor
to
go
with
the

didnt
really
get
the
spice
others
were
finding
long
finish
denser
mouthfeel
with
the
minimal
carbonation
kind
of
sticky
towards
the
end
drank
more
like
a
dessert
wineappertif
than
a
beer
drinkability
is
ok
i
feel
like
im
drinking
pure
honey
or
something
barely
diluted
with
beer
theres
just
so
much
sweetness
here
that
it
doesnt
even
feel
like
its
had
4ish
years
to
mellow
out
the
aroma
is
really
nice
but
the
taste
is
just
like
being
hit
over
the
head
with
sticky
sweet
caramel
and
fruit
too
much

my
taste

able

but
its
a
nice
sipper
thanks
russ
d
could
not
imagine
drinking
more
then
one
at
a
time
a
slow
sweet
sipper
probably
best
suited
to
be
shared
due
to
its
overwhelming
sweetness
d
a
beer
like
this
was
made
to
be
savored
and
if
you
slowly
enjoy
it
is
great
this

has
dark

sweet
malts
delicate
hops
whiskey

and
alcohol
more
of
the
same
in
the
nose
a
well
balanced
super
complex
beer
one
of
the
finest
ales
in
the
world
a
bit
young
and
not
as
good
as
the
standard
version
should
age
well
for
many
many
years
d
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
was
hesitant
to
buy
it
because
i
usually
dislike
any
and
all
apple
flavors
in
beer
but
i
went
ahead
with
it
because
i
have
always
been
so
impressed
by
jw
lees
beer
and
once
again
they
have
not
let
me
down
i
feared
that
the
apple
might
make
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
cloying
but
it
does
he
opposite
the
apple
character
really
only
comes
out
as
it
would
in
a
brandy
with
a
rich
complexity
rather
than
an
excessive
apple
bite
and
it
combines
wonderfully
with
the
caramel
notes
inherent
in
the
harvest
beer
i
cant
say
that
i
want
a
whole
case
of
this
but
it
is
an
exceptional
and
unique
beer
and
i
am
very
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
enjoy
it

a

offered
up
out
of

upon
further
investigation
sweet

prunes

are
noticed
backed
up
by

a

of

the

experience
begins
with
an
initial
medium
bodied
mouth
feel
that
grows
thick
and
viscous
into
the
finish
the
fluid
ushers
in
some
wood

before
the

take
over
with

coated

figs
prunes

about
midway
the

becomes

very
nice
drinkability
is
pretty
good
if
you
like
english
barleywines
whose
intensity
is
obviously
not
for
everyone
still
its
expensive
and
hard
to
come
buy
a
slooow
sipper
for
sure
but
an
enjoyable
one
i
just
bought
the
one
bottle
to
see
what
i
thought
of
it
but
am
really
impressed
and
will
pick
up
some
more
for
cellaring
if
theyre
still
available
3
years
old
ill
bet
this
sucker
has
barely
budged
and
can
go
another

easily
d
as
with

ive
had
this

a

beer
while
i
easily
picked
up
on
the
barrelaged
character
the
calvados
specifically
wasnt
apparent
to
me
the
huge
ciderlike
qualities
of
this
beer
are
a
result
of
the
malt
it
is
still
fantastic
stuff
ill
need
to
snatch
up
another
bottle
and
hunt
down
another
lagavulin

and
compare
now
if
only
it
were
cheaper

jw
lees

not
really
picking
up
any
of
the
calvados

flavor
at
all
surprisingly
the
same
thing
is
present
in
the
taste
same
harvest
ale
flavor
but
the
calvados
cask
aging
is
very
very
subtle
did
i
say
subtle
you
really
have
to
search
for
it
to
find
it
this
is
a

very
well
a
must
try
it
is
a
sipper
heavy
and
full
bodied
mostly
sweet
and
vinous
with
alcoholic
heat
producing
some
balance
nicely
done
but
at
times
a
bit
too
sweet
if
it
was
not
a
very
small
bottle
it
could
have
been
too
much
the
port
version
seems
a
bit
better
balanced
but
this
one
is
still
very
worthwhile
nice
thick
and
viscous
dark
amber
brew
with
very
little
head
which
doesnt
concern
me
given
the
style
and
abv
very
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
but
i
cant
say
i
get
the
calvados
in
the
nose
as
much
as
i
did
the
port
or
lagavulin
in
their
other
expressions
but
there
might
be
a
slight
hint
of
apple
and
walnut
which
would
be
conistent
with
that
drink
fruity
and
a
bit
nutty
the
taste
is
also
quite
sweet
and
fruity
and
the
apple
is
slightly
more
pronounced
baked
apple
with
cinammon
walnuts
sweet
crackers
and
a
hint
of
woddiness
delightful
smooth
sweet
and
viscous
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
delicious
sipper
or
dessert
this
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
copper
color
with
little
to
no
head
at
all
the
head
that
was
present
was
white
little
lacing
present
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
with
hints
of
oak
apples
and
maple
syrup
the
taste
was
similar
with
an
oakiness
to
it
which
added
a
spiciness
in
the
front
had
a
thick
sweet
molasses
flavor
to
it
also
had
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
mouthfeel
was
thick
with
little
carbonation
overall
a
fantastic
barleywine
love
it
ill
be
buying
more
d
a
good
tasting
dessert
beer
but
i
do
not
like
as
well
as
the
sherry
cask
or
regular
jw
lees
harvest
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
it
is
extremely
good
its
just
that
id
rather
have
one
of
those
other
jw
lees
versions
if
those
are
not
available
then
there
are
very
few
beers
i
would
prefer
to
this
one
if
this
is
your
session
beer
you
are
an
alcoholic
the
taste
is
rich
and
fairly
pleasant
but
too
sweet
for
the
long
haul
no
spices
or
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
11
oz
as
a
nightcap
is
pleasant
wouldnt
want
much
more
of
this
beer
the
port
cask
is
more
balanced
and
less
sweet
a
much
better
choice
overall
quite
unique
and
quite
sweet
this
is
not
your
grandmas
barleywine
very
sweet
very
fruity
with
tons
of
malt
the
hops
are
no
where
to
be
seen
in
this
one
so
if
balance
is
what
your
looking
for
look
elsewhere
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
though
and
rather
enjoyable
would
like
to
try
the
whole
line
of
j
w
lees
barleywines
drinkability
if
i
could
give
this
drinkability
a
9
out
of
5
i
would
still
be
giving
this
beer
a
lower
score
than
it
deserves
credit
for
no
traces
of
the
power
of
this
monster
i
could
drink
this
until
i
die
and
be
happy
about
it

of

is

and
major
malts
taste
pretty
much
follows
to
me
this
is
the
least
overpowering
of
the
cask
series
taste
is
of
a
ton
of
malts
and
dark
sugars
very
meaty
with
super
dark
fruits
sugary
as
hell
and
sweet
sweet
sweet
mouthfeel
is
very
thick

viscous
as
far
as
drinkability
the
sugar
and
mouthfeel
defenitely
make
this
one
a
sipper
another
good
one
from
jw
lees
but
i
still
say
nothing
beats
the
good
old
harvest
ale
if
i
were
the
patient
type
id
buy
a
few
bottles
and
see
how
they

close
to
the

cask
with
its

i
love
the
original
harvest
ale
and
find
that
this
one
is
not
blending
well
yet
as
far
as
the
flavors
go
still
an
outstanding
beer
but
compared
to
the
original
i
think
i
would
cellar
it
a
little
longer
to
let
things
develop
drinkability
is
good
an
enjoyable
treat
that
would
be

d
not

i
liked
the
harvest
ale
and
this
is
more
palatable
for
drinking
a
full
bottle
i
will
seek
out
the
the
other
cask
aged
types
what
a
great
desert
beer
this
would
be
the
sweet
apple
flavors
from
the
calvados
cask
aging
are
obvious
and
vigorous
even
perhaps
a
bit
too
overt
for
some
its
an
intense
and
astonishingly
complex
monster
and
it
grows
as
it
warms
a
bit
and
breathes
i
highly
recommend
it
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
or
palate
this
is
a
standalone

very

despite
the

while
this
is
indeed
a
really
nice
drink
i
didnt
think
the
taste
was
as
amazing
as
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
its
very
sweet
and
as
it
warms
no
i
didnt
have
it
cold
just
cool
notes
of
apples
alcohol
and
wood
become
apparent
all
of
this
is
very
nice
but
the
sweetness
here
is
quite
assertive
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
and
solid
which
i
like
very
much
overall
this
is
a
very
nice

there
are

this
beer
retains
some
activity

in

and
keeps
it
from
being
flat
bursting
with
huge
complex
flavors
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
special
edition
harvest
series
in
the
aroma
theres
just
so
much
of
everything
and
in
the
flavor
as
much
as
there
is
the
sweetness
still
slaps
it
back
into
a
subservient
role
but
the
result
is
a
bold
yet
subtle
blend
of
complex
elements
i
can
tell
you
it
is
a
simply
marvelous
partner
to
any
number
of
blue
cheeses
with
cabrales
my
personal
favorite
at
the
moment
the
abv
is
notable
just
slightly
masked
and
a
force
with
which
to
be
reckoned
still
as
a
standalone
sipper
or
as
a
mate
for
earthy
foods
this
is

the
taste
is
sweet
and
tastes
like
brandy
brown
sugar
and
some
dark
fruit
its
a
very
sweet
tasting
brew
mouthfeel
is
full
slick
and
thick
drinkability
is
good
even
though
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
although
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
something
so
strong
i
could
have
this
regularly
if
it
was
available
its
one
of
those
beers
i
dont
think
i
could
get
sick
of
this
is
one
stellar
beer
i
personally
like
the
original
harvest
ale
a
bit
better
especially
when
it
has
about
8
years
of
age
on
it
i
think
ill
be
holding
on
to
one
of
these
for
another
6
years
to
see
if
it
improves
as
much
ill
be
curious
to
see
how
the
cask
flavors
meld
and
hold
up
to
the
age
highly
recommended
if
youre
looking
for
a
sweeter
beer
and
fantastic
on
a
cold
winter
night
by
the
fire
after
a
big
dinner
well
worth
the
7
95
i
paid
for
the
bottle
this
is
a
great
experiment
these
fine
brewers
have
conducted
id
love
to
do
something
of
the
sort
this
one
is
truly
a
treat
it
has
seemed
to
age
really
really
well
with
a
wonderful
balance
of
flavors
and
a
vinous
profile
that
is
not
overpowering
or
overwhelming
i
dig
this
one
honestly
this
sipper
makes
you
understand
what
a
brewers
intentions
are
if
you
dont
like
it
then
you
dont
get
it
d
this
ale
seems
to
do
a
bit
better
when
fresh
vs
an
04
that
i
tried
a
few
weeks
back
but
you
still
can
only
handle
one
at
a

aroma
really
jumps
right
out

with

very
thick
and

maybe
a

of

at

a

from

somehow
this
is
smooth

overly
sweet
the
sweetness
was
too
much
for
me

i
can
faintly

up
some

as
well
mouthfeel

creamy
taste
is
sweet
and
brandy
like
with
a
warming
boozy
finish
the
alcohol
definately
makes
its
presence
felt
in
this
one
overall
another
good
beer
from
j
w
lees
perhaps
this
was
a
bit
too
young
i
will
try
to
age
one
of
these
2005s
a
bit
and
try
again
i
will
try
another
bottle
i
can
taste
the
quality
in
the
beer
and
i
can
sense
the
flavors
of
the
barleywine
but
the
calvados
barrel
had
to
have
a
more
than
average
amount
of
brandy
left
in
it
because
i
have
a
bottle
of
real
calvados
and
it
tastes
like
i
just
drank
it
neat
while
not
an
every
day
drinker
this
is
an
exceptional
treat
that
is
like
liquid
gold
i
cant
wait
to
compare
the
calvados
to
the
sherry
to
the
laguvilin
as
well
as
how
the
age
through
the
years
pours
the
color
of
bright
homemade
apple
cider
with
minimal
head
complex
aroma
of
dark
fruit
figs
raisins
molasses
candi
sugar
bourbony
vanilla
and
a
trace
of
candied
apples
huge
on
the
palate
spiced
molasses
to
start
with
then
apple
tartness
combined
with
rich
figgy
sweetness
followed
by
a
vanilla
crescendo
giant
malt
sweetness
is
maintained
throughout
the
finish
is
long
hot
with
alcohol
and
sweet
a
very
interesting
english
barleywine
it
seems
that
the
calvados
treatment
has
diminished
the
coffeebitter
chocolate
aromasflavors
of
jw
lees
harvest
in
favorite
of
a
stillsweet
slightly
tart
fruitiness
in
line
with
a
calvados
character
very
interesting
brew
shared
a
bottle
on
the
back
deck
in
the
late
evening
highly
drinkable
if
shared
i
couldnt
down
the
whole
thing
myself
overall
2004
calvados
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
maybe
time
in
the
bottle
will
reduce
this
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
actually
it
will
not
as
the
sweetness
coming
from
the
calvados
seems
engrained
a
pleasurable
effort
nonetheless
and
a
nice
night
cap
but
not
one
i
would
pick
up
again
the
initial
taste
was
very
sweet
almost
sickening
the
flavors
that
emerged
were
of
plums
apple
and
walnut
the
apple
was
expected
as
thats
what
calavados
is
made
from
but
the
nutty
flavor
was
unexpected
and
well
received
in
the
end
the
initial
sweetnes
was
a
little
too
much
to
make
this
a
favorite
however
it
is
a
great
example
of
a
different
kind
of
oak
aged
beer
with
complex
flavors
much
more
subdued
than
its
lagavulin
counterpart
and
in
my
opinion
its
a
good
thing
at
least
2
less
rs
than
the
lagavulin
bigger
caramel
with
a
more
complex
malt
component
much
more
balanced
and
drinkable
no
alcohol
present
in
the
mouth
ends
with
a
long
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
yet
still
overly
sweet
hence
a
less
than
stellar
drinkability
the
taste
was
something
else
brandyesque
sweet
strong
calvados
this
wasnt
horrible
didnt
taste
bad
but
boy
is
this
sucker
a
sipper
i
shared
and
we
had
to
eventually
take
turns
taking
gulps
to
finish
it
and
by
gulps
i
mean
barely
large
sips
it
just
wouldnt
end
it
felt
like
it
kept
refilling
itself
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
blah
watery
thin
i
couldnt
have
too
many
of
these
i
couldnt
finish
one
id
rather
have
a
smaller
portion
as
a
long
long
nightcap
taste
has
improved
over
the
years
vanilla
slight
chocolate
multigrain
molasses
caramel
dipped
apples
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
drinkability
is
great
i
could
drink
eight
or
nine
of
these
over
the
course
of
the
day
ill
try
anyway
aroma
is
heavy
on
alcohol
white
fruits
applepear
malt
and
some
lesser
woody
notes
opaque
redbrownamber
in
color
with
no
head
nor
even
the
suggestion
of
one
foretaste
is
tons
of
caramel
malt
sweet
not
quite
ripe
white
fruits
and
a
dry
maybe
that
is
from
the
wood
in
the
casks
hard
to
tell
finish
quite
syrupy
but
didnt
seem
to
work
as
well
to
me
as
the
sherry
aged
version
had
this
beer
last
night
2004
vintage
i
probably
should
have
let
it
age
but
then
i
wouldnt
know
how
it
changes
anyway
served
it
in
a
tulip
glass
at
cellarish
temps
looked
beautiful
in
the
glass
minimal
head
and
bright
amber
color
smelled
strong
of
booze
malt
and
dark
dark
dried
fruits
i
caught
raisins
and
some
prune
in
there
i
think
the
boozey
smell
was
a
bit
over
powering
taste
was
more
of
the
same
incredibly
sweet
dark
dried
fruits
intense
maltiness
and
a
nice
aged
oak
character
i
have
never
had
calvados
but
i
picked
up
a
liquor
character
that
must
have
been
imparted
by
the
cask
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
otherwise
excellent
it
had
a
wonderful
aftertaste
that
lingered
pleasantly
the
toasted
oak
and
roasty
malt
flavors
really
came
out
in
the
aftertaste
i
can
only
imagine
that
they
would
be
more
prevelant
if
the
beer
werent
so
sweet
mouthfeel
was
excellent
nice
and
chewy
just
what
an
english
barleywine
should
be
the
drinkability
suffered
due
to
the
alcohol
presence
and
primarily
due
to
the
sweetness
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
one
9
oz
bottle
all
in
all
it
is
a
good
beer
and
if
the
sweetness
diminishes
with
age
it
will
become
an
excellent
beer
this
is
a
two
or
three
ounce
at
a
time
in
a
snifter
sort
of
creature
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
as
it
were
but
id
give
it
another
go
just
to
be
sure
bright
red
color
fairly
aromatic
full
of
deep
apple
brandy
coconut
and
vanilla
from
the
wood
along
with
a
light
aromatic
malt
presence
with
hints
of
fruits
brown
sugar
and
caramel
the
most
aromatic
of
the
harvest
cask
ales
thus
far
lacking
body
however
like
ever
harvest
cask
ale
flavor
is
very
very
sweet
more
like
a
dessert
beer
and
definately
more
of
an
after
dinner
beer
light
apple
brandy
flavors
caramel
and
fruit
pie
with
well
hidden
alcohol
i
think
these
beer
need
more
time
in
the
barrel
perhaps
they
would
take
on
more
depth
and
body
these
experimental
jw
lee
harvest
ales
are
pricey
to
pick
up
but
the
flavour
more
than
makes
up
for
it
the
calvados
aging
adds
a
definite
dimension
to
the
beer
that
i
enjoyed
and
im
sure
any
english
barley
wine
fan
who
also
likes
the
flavour
of
apples
would
enjoy
this
one
great
beer
this
is
a
sipping
beer
i
recommned
drink
slow
starting
fresh
out
of
the
refrigerator
and
let
it
warm
up
as
you
drink
it
there
will
be
some
noticeable
differences
drinkability
truly
a
sipper
but
a
good
one
when
you
finish
the
beer
and
set
down
the
empty
glass
with
shaky
hands
and
a
dopey
grin
on
your
face
that
means
its
a
good
beer
drinkability
frankly
the
beer
was
to
boozey
and
just
to
dam
sweet
for
my
taste
this
beer
would
probably
be
ok
for
spliting
a
couple
or
three
ways
definately
a
siping
beer
i
still
have
another
bottle
in
the
cellar
that
is
probably
where
it
will
remain
for
a
year
or
ten
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
soft
and
smooth
syrupy
and
full
just
enough
fizz
to
cut
the
sugary
fruit
its
a
sipper
of
course
very
drinkable
but
one
at
a
time

this
was

exciting
explosive
and
sure
to
spur

drinkability

overall
ive
been
through
a
bit
of
a
rough
spell
that
past
couple
of
weeks
things
havent
quite
been
turing
out
the
best
for
me
tonight
i
was
in
particularly
low
spirits
and
i
figured
it
was
time
to
hit
something
special
this
was
it
perfect
tasting
beer
beyond
all
aspects
of
what
i
know
beer
to
be
my
favorite
beers
are
the
overthetop
beers
that
can
still
be
delicious
complex
and
balanced
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
perfectly
some
breweries
go
too
far
in
pushing
the
envelope
the
texture
creamy
and
the
color
a

d
this
was
quite
the
barrel
aged
beer
with
obvious
lagavulin
character
in
the
scent
and
taste
nicely
balanced
by
the
sweetness
of
the

the
finish
was
a

rough
so
it
must
be
sipped
age
would
probably
only

this
was
a

o
this
beer
is
an
excellent
one
to
have
as

or
a

it
certainly
has
its
place
and
is
not
going
to
be
for
everyone
i
personally
am
a
huge
fan
of
islay
scotches
so
i
find
the
beer
quite
good
it
is
wellbalanced
easy
to
sip
and
takes
on
just
enough
of
the
barrel
characteristic
to
make
it
a
beer
that
i
will
keep
in
my
repertoire
of
occasional
elite
treats
very

second
bad
experience
after
trying
the

version
bottles
were
both
a
few
years
old
possibly
past
their
best
both
ended
their
lives
down
the
sink
o
this
was
one
of
the
most
fantastic
ales
in
memory
when
i
first
had
it
in
oct
2012
had
it
on
tap
then
at
the
bar
in
which
i
worked
the
product
from
this
bottle
for
whatever
of
a
variety
of
possible
reasons
is
showing
signs
of
falling
apart
the
fresh
intensity
of
its
original
flavors
dying
off
or
in
transition
still
for
fans
of
the
harvest
ale
and
islay
whiskey
this
is
a
dream
of
a
brew
final
verdict
novel
idea
that
doesnt
work
well
in
this
older
vintage
the
company
website
says
that
some
bottles
have
gone
for
60
but
im
not
seeing
it
at
this
point
may
have
to
try
some
of
the
other
vintages
and
varieties
to
get
a
better

o
remarkably
drinkable
for
its
age
the
slight
hint
of
green
apple
and
lack
of
smokiness
make
this
beer
slightly
less
enjoyable
than
expected
but
it
has
held
up
and
still
has
a
bouquet
of
aromas
and
flavors

with
more

got
from

this
might
be
my
favorite
variant
and
it
is
bordering
on
incredible
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
kind
of
a
smoked
english
barleywine
very
unique
and
worth
trying
just
be
aware
and
ready
for
it
overall
pretty
good
but
the
lagavulin
is
overpowering
and
the
beer
is
too
sweet
not
the
best
treatment
of
the
harvest
ale
maybe
im
not
that
into
english
barleywines
but
king
henry
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
probably
not
a
true
english
bw
anyways
this
beer
had
a
real
boozie
sweet
smell
to
it
and
tasted
the
same
heavy
smokiness
cinnamon
funky
spices
caramel
kind
of
an
unpleasant
tart
taste
to
it
overall
it
tasted
like
a
funky
sweet
syrupy
mess
maybe
fresh
it
tastes
a
lot
better
o
was
not
very
impressed
i
think
the
sediment
and
the
thick
syrupy
texture
ruined
it
for
me
poured
into
a
minisnifter
the
beer
was
a
copper
color
with
a
modest
slight

head
at
the
front
the
aroma
was
a
mild
whiskey
aroma
while
the
aroma
was
enjoyable
it
would
not
make
be
want
to
buy
the
beer
again
by
itself
in
the
initial
taste
one
gets
sweet
malts
nuttiness
amaretto
and
a
mild
sourness
even
with

does
not
leave
an

alcohol
burn
the
thick

i
might
define
the
aftertaste
as
a
syrupy
sweet
alcohol
that
is
masked

enough
to
be
like
a

drink

hazy
amber
color
with
tons
of
sediment
the
aroma
is
nice
hints
of
vanilla
caramel
oak
and
toffee
are
abound
the
taste
follows
well
with
a
sweet
blend
of
all
the
aforementioned
notes
plus
a
slight
whisky
burn
and
an
indescribably
smooth
finish
the
lack
of
burn
really
masks
the
alcohol
content

this
one
really
has
the
potential
to
sneak
up
and
dropkick
a
lot
of
people
all
in
all
a
very
very
good
brew
o
had
to
downgrade
some
scores
as
this
did
not
age
as
well
as
id
hoped
losing
the
lagavulin
peat
and
smoke
did
not
improve
the
taste
of
the
beer
which
i
found
to
be
far
too
sugary
for
my
liking
and
the
appearance
of
so
much
sediment
was
due
in
part
to
my
pour
but
still
detracted
from
the
drinking
experience
i
was
hoping
for
overall
i
knew
nothing
about
this
beer
prior
to
this
tasting
and
the
smoky
scotch
flavors
were
a
surprise
but
a
good
surprise
the
smoke
is
quite
dominant
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
it
would
best
stand
alone
rather
than
pairing
with
any
food
although
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
it
with
bbqed
pork
i
will
look
for
it
again
taste
is
very
sweet
a
bit
spicy
smoky
with
dry
toast
and
bread
finish

a

on

for

very

of

with
dark

with
a
fair
amount
of
barrel
character
that
isnt
overwhelming
and
zero
cloying
sweetness
after
the
finish
minimal
carbonation
and
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
slick
and
fairly
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
english
barleywine
all
around
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
and
barrel
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
slowly
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
the
harvest
ale
always
tends
to
be
fairly
sweet
but
this
is
a
bit
much
one
of
sweetest
beers
ive
had
and
kind
of
hard
to
finish
without
someone
to
help
a
cigar
would
be
fine
compliment
to
this
beer
though
overall
im
not
really
digging
this
its
strong
but
not
necessarily
offensive
on
the
nose
and
nearing
harsh
in
the
taste
and
not
just
because
of
the
alcohol
content
quite
a
different
take
on
english
barleywines
for
sure
but
just
not
for
me
d
if
i
could
make
three
wishes
for
this
beer
they
would
be
more
peat
more
seaweed
more
fresh
smoke
the
oceanic
pungency
that
i
love
about
islay
scotch
is
all
but
lost
in
the
malt
sweetness
the
scotches
themselves
are
plenty
sweet
but
still
retain
a
balance
this
one
sadly
does
not
this
is
a
great
beer
and
very
monsterous
and
a
must
try
for
anyone
that
loves
this
type
of
scotch
but
be
aware
that
the
taste
is
of
smoked
wood
not
smoked
barley
like
you
oversmoked
your
bbq
by
adding
too
much
oak
im
glad
i
found
this
bottle
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
buy
another
one
o
normally
i
find
that
i
rate
the
aroma
and
flavor
in
most
beers
about
the
same
for
some
reason
the
nose
on
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
but
the
flavor
sure
did
very
nice
beer
better
than
the
ba
average
in
my
opinion
overall
enjoyable
variation
better
than
some
of
the
others
i
dont
always
love
a
scotch
barrel
on
a
beer
but
the
intensity
of
the
whiskey
flavor
tends
to
subdue
the
sweetness
of
the
base
beer
overall
great
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
regular
version
2005
vintage
this
is
another
one
of
those
special
beers
that
in
each
category
cant
be
scored
anything
too
high
but
taken
on
the
whole
are
quite
amazing
this
is
one
of
those
for
sure
it
pours
clear
whiskey
color
with
almost
no
head
there
are
some
dark
brown
yeast
floaters
at
the
bottom
and
gentle
carbonation
it
smells
like
a
barleywine
caramely
english
malty
and
very
very
sweet
there
is
also
a
mature
woody
aroma
and
a
great
deal
of
alcohol
it
taste
very
organic
very
old
and
very
sweet
there
is
a
ton
of
residual
sugar
here
and
an
already
sweeter
malt
profile
no
hops
at
all
to
speak
of
and
a
punishing
alcohol
sting
the
whiskey
barrel
adds
a
touch
of
charcoal
and
vanilla
flavor
and
a
smoothness
of
feel
this
thing
is
velvet
even
with
the
abv
what
it
is
carbonation
is
really
mild
so
the
sugars
sort
of
stay
in
the
mouth
awhile
it
is
about
what
i
expected
when
i
got
this
huge
and
sweet
its
got
a
richness
and
a
certain
refined
character
that
set
it
apart
worth
a
try
if
youve
got
the
bucks
o
even
if
i
was
a
fan
of
scotch
this
would
still
be
a
crappy
barleywine
crap
appearance
crap
body
oxidized
just
not
good
overall
as
a
lover
of
big
sweet
english
barleywines
and
of
islay
scotch
things
dont
get
much
better
than
this
i
would
happily
drink
one
of
these
everyday
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
will
most
certainly
be
attempting
to
trade
for
a
case
in
the
near
future
i
had
a
very
hard
time
grading
this
one
the
flavors
where
not
necessarily
unpleasant
but
definitely
unexpected
and
a
bit
over
the
top
with
the
scotch
definitely
would
not
want
more
than
the
few
ounces
i
had
and
i
could
see
how
even
that
would
be
a
bit
much
for
some
people
a
murky
iced
tea
brown
with
little
to
no
cap
or
lacing
just
the
thinnest
of
collars
around
the
edge
big
peat
smokey
aroma
on
top
of
old
leather
butterscotch
cocoa
powder
toffee
raisins
and
oak
just
loads
of
complexity
the
flavor
profile
follows
the
nose
peat
and
smoke
throughout
with
tobacco
raisins
toffee
cocoa
powder
leather
and
raisins
a
good
shot
of
fusel
alcohol
leads
to
some
good
warming
the
feel
is
a
bit
syrupy
fullbodied
with
low
carbonation
this
beer
is
amazingly
complex
albeit
dominated
by
the
peat
smokey
aroma
and
flavors
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
peat
whiskey
move
along
o
wow
like
drinking
an
ashtray
filled
with
burnt
bandaids
i
poured
it
out
after
drinking
two
sips
this
beer
was
so
bad
that
it
actually
gave
me
a
headache
somehow
you
must
love
scotch
to
even
attempt
this
beer
overall
probably
one
of
my
favorite
ba
beers
the
whisky
is
wonderfully
incorporated
and
sweetness
is
spot
hot
i
havent
had
one
with
this
much
age
and
its
transcendent
love
love
love
d
very
drinkable
the
whisky
blends
really
nicely
with
the
rich
bold
barleywine
base
nicely
complex
o
considering
its
strength
the
alcohol
is
relatively
well
hidden
from
the
taste
the
interesting
smell
and
taste
also
make
it
a
nice
beer
to
sip
o
very
little
alcohol
in
the
smelltastemouthfeel
which
is
surprising
considering
the
high
abv
had
on
tap
at
maxs
in
baltimore
not
a
big
whisky
drinker
at
all
so
not
sure
of
the
lagavulin
taste
but
this
was
a
damn
tasty
beer
thats
for
a
sipper
for
sure
full
flavored
and
full
bodied
with
a
nice
woodsy
kick
to
it
would
be
a
great
nightcap
and
is
a
delicious
barleywine
would
be
interesting
to
compare
this
at
the
same
time
with
the
other
whisky
casks
although
quite
dangerous
o
this
is
a
great
beer
will
need
to
find
it
again
at
11
5
abv
there
is
a
definite
warming
effect
that
i
enjoyed
overall
i
loved
this
im
a
scotch
lover
and
lagavulin
is
one
of
my
favorites
if
you
like
scotch
theres
a
good
chance
youll
like
this
beer
the
many
complimentary
tastes
work
wonderfully
in
concert
and
make
this
a
very
pleasurable
drink
serious
amount
of
sediment
like
wheres
the
cheesecloth
otherwise
bright
and
clear
amber
orange
coloration
with
a
reddish
cast
close
to
total
absence
of
any
head
or
lacing
even
a
vigorous
swirl
gets
you
nothing
no
bubbles
visible
looks
dead
in
terms
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
highly
aggressive
and
gets
right
in
there
beef
jerky
leather
pork
rinds
candied
orange
peels
vanilla
pudding
very
heady
and
boozy
poached
apricots
and
peaches
honey
and
licorice
deserves
to
be
allowed
to
come
close
to
room
temperature
to
truly
strut
its
stuff
mediumbodied
while
heavy
in
some
respects
not
leaden
and
certainly
moves
agilely
while
it
stays
aligned
with
its
overall
goals
the
gamey
leathery
qualities
persist
its
like
having
a
smokehouse
in
your
mouth
is
this
liquid
pork
the
dried
fruit
quality
peach
apricot
nectarine
apple
fruit
thick
and
viscous
start
to
finish
here
the
caramel
vanilla
butterscotch
cola
bean
oak
dominant
particularly
as
it
warms
this
is
a
beer
meant
to
be
slowly
sipped
in
front
of
a
roaring
fire
with
a
cigar
in
hand
smoky
with
its
own
tobacco
and
ash
qualities
has
to
be
taken
at
face
value
theres
no
great
beers
just
great
bottles
of
beers
psyche
2007
release
overall
this
is
really
great
certainly
a
sipper
the
biggest
downfall
here
is
a
that
gritty
bitterness
that
sits
on
the
back
of
the
palate
on
the
finish
the
sweetness
is
certainly
the
key
player
here
worth
checking
out
if
youre
feeling
bold
o
real
glad
to
have
had
this
the
charred
oak
in
the
barrel
is
great
this
would
go
great
with
a
steak
i
cant
get
over
how
smooth
this
is
this
is
whiskey
as
beer
literally
i
think
it
should
be
had
on
cask
to
see
the
real
transition
without
the
carbonation
thank
you
pbw
this
was
my
first
time
in
the
cask
series
of
jw
lees
while
i
prefer
the
original
over
the
lagavulin
make
no
mistake
that
this
is
delicious
beer
i
wont
pick
up
this
beer
again
and
leave
the
bottle
fairly
disappointed
in
how
unbalanced
the
beer
and
whisky
qualities
are
displayed
in
the
brew
easy
decision
drain
pour
i
love
lagavulin
and
this
delivers
great
flavors
from
that
whiskey
the
jw
lees
sweetness
still
carries
in
but
the
whiskey
use
here
just
rocks
o
a
great
thick
little
sipper
very
syrupy
and
smooth
alcohol
warmth
is
very
mellow
peat
flavors
are
unique
but
easy
to
get
used
to
pretty
good
all
around
overall
good
beer
with
nice
complexity
but
the
bottom
line
is
its
too
sweet
for
menever
thought
i
could
say
this
about
an
english
barleywine
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
style
alot
but
its
just
a
little
over
the
top
sweet
o
skip
this
its
bad
on
cask
at
least
it
would
be
fine
if
i
had
it
with
pancakes
in
the
morning
alongside
an
fbs
since
it
tastes
like
bacon
and
apples
at
10
for
a
pour
forget
this
garbage
poured
a
copperish
body
with
minimal
head
on
top
of
a
strong
whiskeyoak
aroma
with
a
think
yeast
aroma
as
well
and
touches
of
honey
and
sugary
sweetness
and
black
cherry
the
yeast
sediment
sticks
to
the
bottom
and
slowly
dissolves
every
time
i
take
a
sip
thick
sticky
has
a
boozy
but
not
medicinal
taste
the
sweet
malts
are
great
and
this
is
a
very
sweet
and
sturdy
beer
a
great
after
lunch
sipper
slightly
warming
as
i
sip
real
nice
finish
no
dry
or
bitterness
as
hops
barely
noticeable
but
a
real
good
sweet
and
malty
beer
to
relax
with
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
i
moved
through
it
the
unusual
whiskey
is
really
nice
the
complexities
lovely
really
good
beer
thats
licking
the
boot
of
excellent
looking
forward
to
the
other
varietals
tastes
like
big
sweet
malt
up
front
sticky
toffee
pudding
and
fresh
cherries
and
then
the
whisky
barrel
comes
in
and
builds
gradually
the
barrel
treatment
certainly
comes
through
more
on
the
palate
than
on
the
nose
mature
scotch
with
industrial
smoke
and
salty
ocean
air
nicely
restrained
and
a
great
complement
to
the
sweet
fruity
malt
long
long
finish
with
the
smoke
building
becoming
almost
completely
dry
with
only
peat
smoke
and
roasted
nuts
lingering
at
the
very
end
amazing
after
such
a
sweet
attack
very
tasty
stuff
with
great
balance
and
complexity
this
bottle
was
a
vintage
2013
o
this
is
a
very
good
barelywine
to
me
i
think
2
years
was
perfect
for
this
one
minimal
alcohol
with
a
fair
amount
of
barrel
really
make
this
a
pleasure
to
drink
you
do
not
taste
the
11
5
at
all
if
this
wasnt
so
spendy
i
would
have
a
fridge
full
of
it
o
i
had
to
try
it
the
concept
is
very
cool
i
just
didnt
enjoy
the
beer
though
so
my
vertical
tasting
of
all
four
of
these
is
complete
like
the
rochefort
tasting
this
was
a
bust
i
am
glad
i
did
it
but
wont
buy
these
again
o
i
enjoyed
tasting
this
beer
and
differentiating
the
characteristics
however
its
not
something
that
really
caught
my
attention
if
theres
one
liquor
that
works
with
the
ubersweet
harvest
ale
an
islay
scotch
is
it
great
mix
of
sweet
and
smoky
o
a
fine
beer
the
peat
smells
and
flavors
are
nothing
ive
ever
seen
in
a
beer
before
very
interesting
indeed
i
enjoyed
the
earthy
sweetness
and
peat
smokiness
together
might
drink
again
o
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
beer
experiences
ive
ever
had
i
feel
privalaged
oh
and
i
bet
this
would
make
a
killer
barbecue
sauce
o
this
is
phenominal
its
everything
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
its
crazy
how
many
things
are
going
on
in
this
glass
no
wonder
j
w
lees
is
one
of
the
top
makers
of
barleywine
in
the
world
they
really
know
how
to
do
it
really
looking
forward
to
trying
all
the
variations
of
this
brew
o
truly
disgusted
by
this
beer
this
must
be
one
of
those
that
you
either
love
or
hate
with
no
inbetween
the
longer
i
look
at
this
it
looks
like
diarrhea
in
a
glass
smells
like
a
pile
of
wet
half
burnt
leaves
tastes
horrible
not
even
sure
at
this
point
if
i
want
to
continue
cellaring
the
bottle
i
have
left
im
gonna
drain
pour
something
i
paid
a
dollar
an
ounce
for
after
one
sip
truly
disgusting
o
really
really
liked
this
beer
love
the
scotch
and
it
works
really
well
with
this
style
and
beer
would
pay
the
price
of
this
beer
impressive
beer
still
but
the
barrelaging
imparts
only
subtle
characteristics
maybe
a
bit
more
spice
and
a
trace
of
peat
overall
this
may
not
be
to
my
particular
taste
but
i
can
still
tell
that
its
an
interesting
and
somewhat
special
beer
id
definitely
recommend
it
to
someone
wanting
an
intense
english
bw
generally
speaking
i
skip
these
and
go
for
the
base
beer
overall
drinkability
possibly
the
most
complex
and
flavorful
beer
ive
ever
had
appearance
is
probably
the
worst
part
of
this
beer
a
muddied
redwood
brown
with
a
thin
wisp
of
head
no
lacing
and
very
little
carbonation
almost
still
the
nose
is
bright
with
churned
oaky
butter
rich
toffee
and
caramel
bread
pudding
plum
qlong
with
a
complex
melange
of
salt
sea
and
iodine
kicking
off
at
the
very
end
the
taste
is
just
the
opposite
with
the
whisky
front
and
center
i
could
honestly
guess
this
was
aged
in
a
lagavulin
cask
or
ardbeg
classic
hallmarks
of
lagavulin
grainy
red
fruit
tons
of
smoke
and
peat
and
for
me
very
medicinal
i
get
iodine
more
than
anything
but
to
me
thats
exactly
how
lagavulin
tastes
the
beers
finishes
very
smooth
and
not
overly
sweet
a
nice
touch
of
slightly
sour
acidity
and
oaky
tannins
pull
through
the
heavy
amount
of
malts
i
really
really
liked
this
beer
and
im
not
a
huge
scotch
guy
much
less
islays
but
it
works
here
2010
vintage
price
11
99
at
whole
foods
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
i
would
probably
rate
this
as
slightly
better
than
the
2000
vintage
of
the
harvest
ale
i
had
recently
the
lagavulin
cask
really
helps
to
cut
the
sweetness
while
adding
much
more
diverse
flavors
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
enjoyed
every
drop
of
this
beer
i
will
be
seeking
out
the
other
cask
versions
of
this
beer
for
sure
a
fine
dessert
beer
that
has
mellowed
into
a
pleasant
sipper
this
one
poured
out
much
like
the
others
the
color
is
a
dark
orange
with
a
very
thin
head
on
top
and
vanishes
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
sweet
inviting
aroma
with
some
boozy
qualities
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
hefty
amount
of
whiskey
notes
and
sweet
malts
that
are
very
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
again
creamy
and
smooth
overall
this
beer
much
like
the
others
is
quite
good
i
feel
that
this
one
is
probably
my
least
favorite
though
overall
not
very
impressed
with
this
i
enjoy
the
regular
version
much
much
more
o
this
is
hands
down
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
must
try
doverall
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
to
date
i
set
down
and
thought
about
this
bc
i
didnt
want
to
hype
up
my
100th
beer
more
than
it
was
but
this
seriously
tasted
amazing
i
saw
other
reviwes
of
the
earlier
vintages
tasting
like
bbq
sause
and
not
being
pleasing
the
2004
is
the
real
deal
get
this
beer
if
u
can
its
complexity
and
smoothness
was
amazing
i
want
to
have
this
again
forsure
o
considerably
better
than
the
sherry
cask
version
i
still
prefer
the
regular
harvest
but
this
was
a
welcome
departure
for
an
evening
overall
a
very
unique
beer
one
that
i
am
glad
is
readily
available
tons
of
earthy
notes
and
dessert
like
sweetness
nothing
you
could
drink
all
night
but
a
great
night
cap
or
sipper
o
the
lagavulin
version
is
an
interesting
yet
challenging
beer
just
short
of
world
class
taste
again
all
i
can
saw
is
damnit
was
so
looking
forward
to
this
one
275ml
bottle2006
edition
pours
cloudy
caramel
color
with
some
floaties
and
no
head
aroma
of
whisky
caramel
malts
and
some
peat
taste
is
sweet
with
a
smokiness
to
it
dried
fruit
dipped
in
sweet
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
slick
texture
smooth
finish
while
its
a
sweet
beer
its
not
cloying
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
good
good
depth
of
flavor
interesting
combination
of
sweet
toffee
maltiness
with
smokey
peated
strong
whiskey
the
dominating
character
is
of
the
whiskey
would
like
to
see
how
that
changes
with
time
i
have
another
bottle
that
i
am
sitting
down
for
at
least
5
years
to
see
how
things
play
out
over
some
time
d
this
definitely
drinks
more
like
a
liquor
while
its
not
flat
it
is
very
very
and
sweet
that
taking
drink
after
drink
would
just
be
too
much
for
me
little
sips
of
this
go
a
long
way
pours
a
hazy
brownish
to
orangeish
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
oaky
with
a
hint
of
whiskey
in
the
taste
oaky
whiskey
all
the
way
through
it
and
a
nice
dry
malt
a
small
alcohol
like
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
oaky
whiskey
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
like
drinking
whiskey
with
out
the
burn
nice
big
flavor
but
nose
is
lacking
a
bit
so
interesting
experiment
happy
to
try
it
unlikely
to
return
to
it
ill
try
a
more
recent
brew
if
i
come
across
it
but
will
not
want
to
try
the
2007
vintage
again
unfortunately
i
have
another
one
in
my
currently
5
bottle
cellar
deep
drawer
in
a
cool
part
of
the
house
d
drinkability
is
probably
where
this
beer
suffers
most
as
its
pretty
sweet
and
smoky
which
may
turn
some
people
off
not
me
however
sometimes
rauchbiers
can
be
a
little
to
smokey
for
me
but
i
found
this
to
be
the
perfect
balance
between
smokiness
and
maltiness
thanks
to
my
pal
ron
for
access
to
this
2007
vintage
bottle
a
somewhat
murky
toffee
color
with
a
scant
white
ring
on
top
and
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
says
nice
smoky
oak
with
toffee
and
ham
even
chocolate
with
a
very
deep
scotch
whiskey
base
uniquely
beautiful
the
flavor
comes
on
with
a
surprisingly
smooth
and
mellow
blend
of
sweet
smoky
toffee
with
pineapple
scotch
and
molasses
malt
the
sweet
smoke
that
results
from
this
scotch
themed
ale
is
so
unusual
and
delicious
so
easy
to
drink
despite
the
obvious
alcohol
presence
its
near
full
bodied
with
fair
but
light
carbonation
one
of
the
better
brews
of
the
year
especially
for
the
scotch
whiskey
lovers
out
there
awesome
the
barrel
adds
a
lot
to
this
one
i
love
the
peaty
whiskey
you
can
taste
a
ton
of
smokiness
on
this
one
and
a
lot
of
earthiness
it
adds
a
lot
to
the
beer
i
feel
overall
it
was
a
fun
experience
and
it
makes
me
want
to
try
the
other
variants
id
have
this
one
again
too
oh
well
at
least
i
will
never
be
tempted
to
pay
9
for
a
12
oz
bottle
of
this
drink
is
decent
a
bit
of
warming
booze
quite
a
bit
of
smoke
and
mesquite
but
drinkable
because
this
beer
doesnt
say

hides
quite
well
in
this
one
this
ale
may
have
one
of
the
most
cask
imparted
flavored
ive
ever
had
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
despainmakesbeeroct
02
and
the
lagavulin
notes
are
very
strong
at
times
this
tasted
more
like
scotch
than
beer
took
me
90
minutes
to
finish
this
because
its
more
like
drinking
three
glasses
of
scotch
than
one
bottle
of
beer
also
i
had
already
downed
a
pint
of

and
loathe

you
may
want
to
pass
but
if
youd
like
to
challenge
your
palette
and
see
a
place
where
barley
wines
have
yet
to
venture
definitely
go
out
and
get
this
one
very
good
all
surreptitious
and
whatnot
the
harsh
sweetness
and
seeming
dearth
of
lagavulin
on
my
tongue
hurt
the
overall
score
a
bit
the
body
is
a
heavy
medium
as
im
sure
the
aging
process
mellowed

this

amongst
the
special
offerings
in
fact
had
this
at
a

tasting
event
it
was
late
in
the
night
so
specifics
on
this
beer
are
a
bit
fuzzy

i
do
remember
it
was
a
world
class
example
of
an
english
barleywine
overall
very
well
done
beer
i
am
just
now
breaking
my
palate
into
barleywines
and
this
one
is
a
true
gem
a
bit
on
the
candysweet
side
but
pretty
remarkable
a
benchmark
for
the
style
for
sure
considering
all
that
the

scene
has
done
with
barleywines

one
ounces

a

pour
more
for

share
with
your
girlfriends

and
then
do
it
not

im
a

of

and
i
definitely
get
the

so
much
so
thats

a
teeny
bit
too
sweet
but
thats
what
i
expected
from
a
port
wouldve
preferred
a
bit
more
barrel
influence
but
overall
this
was
nice
o
this
is
the
third

ive
had

lees
and
its
always
the
same
issue
overwhelming
nasty

in
the
taste
as
it
warmed
it
began
to
smell
better
like
a
liqueur
but
the
taste
was
horrendous
not

purchase
these
little
bottles
at
your
own
risk
the
lack
of
bubbles
and
the
high
amount
of
sediment
detract
from
an
otherwise
complex
flavorful
well
balanced
and
interesting

im
glad
i
tried

it

overall
i
would
like
three
cases
of
this
and
a
deserted
island
please
this
ones
just
not
for
me
i
guess
overall
very
nice
flavour
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
very
good
stuff
an
excellent
night
cap
put
on
your
smoking
jacket
and
bust
out
the
pipe
this
will
turn
you
into
a
fancy
pants
pinky
out
definitely
glad
i
enjoyed
after
dinner
still
wanting
to
try
the
others
cheers
d
this
was
not
nearly
as
awesome
as
i
hoped
only
a
few
years
old
and
already
seems
ancient
the
scent
and
taste
had
great
elements
but
they
were
canceled
out
by
some
undesirable
oxidation
notes
the
body
was
good
not
great
the
finish
was
kind
of
rough
with
some
alcohol
noticeable
so
it
was
challenging
to
drink
a
shame
this
had
a
lot
of
potential
but
ended
up
being
subpar
taste
is
definitely
the
high
point
but
this
scarcely
tastes
like
beer
at
all
more
like
a
port
cut
with
brown
sugar
water
but
hey
i
like
port
i
like
brown
sugar
ergo
this
is
a
good
beer
beer
a
sweet
fullbodied
mistress
she
and
blue
cheese
will
make
you
swoon
overall
an
awesome
beer
i
would
buy
again
but
not
something
you
can
drink
more
than
one
of
actually
finishing
the
undersized
bottle
is
a
little
much
as
it
is
so
rich
o
4
overall
not
as
complex
as
id
hoped
the
sweetness
port
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
it
slow
sipper
which
is
always
a
welcome
change
i
feel
like
im
drinking
something
more
than
a
beer
its
nice
enough
and
wins
some
originality
points
but
its
not
interesting
enough
to
buy
again
o
one
damn
fine
english
barleywine
that
only
gets
better
with
the
port
cask
hugely
complex
and
definitely
a
sipper
the
only
drawback
is
the
appearance
gross
i
can
definitely
look
past
that
because
of
the
complexity
though
very
pricey
at
nearly
1
an
ounce
but
worth
it
every
once
in
a
while
o
quality
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
almost
couldnt
finish
it
overall
very
nice
pairing
of
barrelaging
and
base
beer
preferred
this
version
to
the
calvados
cask
version
overall
the
nose
shows
up
the
taste
on
this
one
there
is
a
disappointing
lack
of
complexity
it
makes
for
a
sweet
pleasant
sipper
but
nothing
exceptional
the
tannic
wood
flavor
also
seems
to
dominate
along
with
the
sweetness
overall
the
best
barrel
treatment
ive
had
so
far
the
only
one
worth
the
money
id
say
o
by
far
the
best
harvest
ale
barrel
treatment
great
balance
of
flavors
still
stupidly
sweet
but
so
much
smoother
and
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
the
port
adds
some
nice
complexity
to
the
base
beer
good
overall
balance
overall
a
very
solid
beer
there
are
a
lot
of
nice
flavors
but
the
sweetness
overpowers
a
little
overall
all
of
these
are
hard
to
drink
for
me
either
too
sweet
or
strong
this
is
a
sipping
beer
and
definitley
worth
a
try
port
cask
aged
jw
lees
pours
an
opaque
mahogany
theres
about
half
a
finger
of
khaki
colored
foam
topping
the
beer
and
flashing
just
a
little
bit
of
head
retention
and
lacing
theres
a
ton
of
sediment
settling
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
more
than
id
expect
to
come
from
such
a
small
bottle
the
port
cask
aging
is
very
evident
in
the
nose
lots
of
potent
dark
fruits
like
one
would
expect
from
port
theres
just
a
hint
of
oxidation
present
and
some
caramel
aroma
as
well
the
base
barleywine
shines
through
a
little
more
in
the
flavor
profile
balancing
well
against
the
port
influence
oxidation
remains
very
much
secondaryin
the
background
the
body
while
firmly
malty
is
miles
away
from
syrupy
thanks
in
part
to
a
spot
on
mild
carbonation
this
iteration
of
jw
lees
marries
one
of
my
favorite
styles
to
one
of
my
favorite
barrel
treatments
with
predictably
great
results
i
cant
wait
to
try
my
hand
at
brewing
something
in
this
vein
over
the
summer
o
a
fantastic
desert
beer
that
i
enjoyed
more
than
the
01
harvest
ale
i
had
last
year
seems
to
have
just
the
right
amount
of
time
on
it
overall
the
aroma
is
fantastic
the
taste
complex
and
robust
it
can
be
a
little
woodsy
but
still
drinkable
i
have
other
bottles
so
ill
let
them
sit
for
a
while
and
see
how
they
change
o
like
the
port
whose
casks
this
beer
was
aged
in
this
beer
would
be
best
served
in
a
very
small
glass
after
dinner
for
sipping
i
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
too
high
in
abv
to
be
a
beer
that
you
could
have
multiple
in
a
session
pours
a
dark
slightly
hazy
cola
brown
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
aroma
has
a
strong
overtone
of
miso
plus
a
firm
note
of
port
and
hints
of
malt
and
caramel
malty
fruity
flavor
has
an
overtone
of
miso
and
an
underpinning
of
wood
plus
quite
a
bite
from
the
alcohol
and
some
woody
bitterness
texture
is
thick
and
smooth
not
quite
syrupy
a
little
lacking
in
fizz
really
a
pleasant
beer
but
the
flavor
is
not
up
to
par
with
what
i
expect
from
this
brewery
overall
bought
one
in
birmingham
alabama
my
home
town
tomorrow
im
going
back
to
buy
all
they
have
and
ask
them
to
buy
more
will
take
this
punkin
next
hunting
trip
with
cigar
cheers
overall
i
love
quality
old
ales
and
english
barleywines
but
i
am
fed
up
with
these
j
w
lees
expensive
syrupy
disasters
they
are
all
too
sweet
and
just
too
much
in
the
malt
department
more
like
a
cordial
than
a
beer
i
have
tried
several
examples
but
never
again
pours
an
insanely
cloudy
light
turdish
color
this
seriously
looked
like
dirty
dishwater
it
was
really
disgusting
looking
after
i
got
past
that
it
was
decent
but
not
all
that
good
the
nose
had
some
nice
port
notes
along
with
plenty
of
oak
and
a
bit
of
oxidation
the
flavor
was
more
port
and
some
sweetness
with
a
bit
too
much
oxidation
leading
to
a
bit
of
cardboard
medium
body
and
close
to
flat
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
cardboard
dryness
really
disgusting
to
look
at
and
an
okay
beer
after
that
overall
again
delicious
i
will
definitely
be
keeping
a
bottle
of
this
onhand
for
when
i
have
the
taste
for
a
surefire
winner
highlyrecommended
for
someone
who
likes
their
barleywines
on
the
sweeter
side
cheers
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
has
held
up
well
its
seems
3
years
might
be
the
peak
before
it
starts
to
fall
off
as
compared
to
the
08
this
was
significantly
less
oxidized
a
malt
and
wheat
bomb
with
small
amounts
of
the
aging
barrels
present
overall
have
a
few
things
im
aging
just
had
a
2002
harvest
that
was
just
awesome
i
imagine
some
age
will
do
the
same
for
this
o
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
really
wanted
this
to
be
my
benchmark
but
it
is
just
too
sweet
i
do
find
that
i
am
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
has
it
warms
up
i
think
im
going
to
try
some
of
the
other
varsities
the
sherry
or
even
better
the
whisky
may
cut
the
edge
a
little
better
than
the
port
adding
to
the
sweetness
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
taste
is
a
little
different
than
what
i
expected
from
the
smell
but
it
was
good
ive
been
impressed
with
jw
lees
barrel
aging
i
can
tell
they
take
their
time
with
it
and
get
it
right
ill
be
seeking
out
the
other
variations
not
my
cup
of
beer
way
sweet
heavy
and
just
some
distinctly
bizarre
characters
that
i
find
a
bit
too
much
to
handle
i
can
see
someone
else
really
enjoying
this
beer
but
its
not
for
me
notes
interesting
but
hard
to
say

i

of

i
like

much
more
than
the
lagavulin
the

flavors
went
great
with
the
alcohol

muskiness
would

from

thank
you
j
w

for
a
job
well
done
i
dig
it
a
fine
brew
from
the
fine
folks
of
manchester
taste
is
a
super
sweet
barleywine
not
cloying
but
i
wonder
how
it
would
be
fresh
good
body
to
it
and
still
good
carbonation
too
oak
rich
flavor
good
complexity
apples
caramel
toffee
very
good
heavy
thickness
in
the
mouthfeel
but
surprisingly
low
presentation
of
alcohol
even
with
the
high
abv
classic
of
course
and
one
most
all
bas
should
give
a
try
o
really
turned
off
by
the
fact
that
i
had
to
strain
this
brew
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
as
i
had
never
had
a
jw
lees
before
and
i
love
port
which
i
will
say
that
it
had
a
great
port
characteristic
to
it
it
had
some
really
good
flavor
just
a
bit
sweet
this
pours
out
as
a
copperish
orange
color
with
a
very
minimal
head
on
top
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
malty
a
little
smokey
and
has
some
light
wooden
aromas
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
faint
tart
flavor
in
there
with
a
big
syrupy
sweetness
overlapping
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
creamy
feeling
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
much
like
the
others
its
something
that
needs
to
be
enjoyed
over
a
period
of
time
and
probably
best
split
with
a
friend
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
beer
again
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
validates
the
whole
beer
hobby
i
sat
down
an
hour
ago
to
begin
tasting
and
reviewing
this
beer
and
thought
as
usual
about
what
kind
of
activity
id
engage
in
while
i
drinkand
just
found
myself
sitting
and
sipping
the
entire
time
the
beer
commanded
my
full
attention
gracefully
and
endlessly
rewarding
me
for
the
entirety
of
the
glass
which
still
is
not
finished
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
side
tasting
note
one
favorite
pairing
for
port
is
chocolate
a
good
dark
chocolate
and
a
tawny
port
both
compliment
and
enhance
each
others
flavors
this
experiment
did
not
work
very
well
for
this
beer
the
chocolate
overwhelmed
the
port
character
and
left
a
muddled
impression

drink
this
is
the
second
best
of
the
four
variants
the
flavors
are
the
most
well
put
together
besides
the
calvados
im
glad
i
got
to
try
all
four
but
probably
wont
come
back
to
them
four
flavors
im
not
the
most
comfortable
with
but
the
experience
was
well
worth
it
a
must
try
for
all
drinkers
to
experience
new
and
big
flavors
wine
notes
come
out
with
warmth
and
make
it
a
good
beer
without
them
it
would
have
been
way
too
extremely
sweet
and
honey
forward
the
yeast
floaties
are
amongst
the
scariest
i
have
ever
seen
notes
this
was
the
last
pending
harvest
casks
to
try
and
it
maintains
the
quality
and
overall
extraordinary
sense
the
port
side
is
rather
subtle
and
maybe
a
bit
shy
compared
to
the
others
in
particular
the
lagavulin
which
stands
on
a
category
of
its
own
for
me
but
this
is
a
great
brew
in
any
case
o
perhaps
a
little
oxidized
but
for
a
beer
brewed
6
years
ago
this
thing
is
really
holding
up
dynamite
stuff
im
not
sure
where
this
ranks
with
different
ages
and
all
but
this
is
about
as
great
a
beer
drinking
experience
as
i
can
recall
i
just
want
more
in
my
bottle
9
99
gone
in
30
minutes
i
need
a
raise
to
keep
this
pace
up
d
a
solid
barleywine
easily
my
most
favorite
thus
far
from
the
jw
lees
variations
the
port
cask
smoothes
this
out
while
adding
subtle
complexities
and
richness
good
stuff
right
here
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
brownish
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
oaky
wine
like
i
assume
port
in
the
taste
sweet
oak
vanilla
and
big
port
wine
flavor
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
oak
with
wine
undertones
in
the
aftertaste
nice
wine
presence
a
bit
hot
from
alcohol
but
a
nice
sipper
o
a
pretty
good
variation
of
jw
lees
but
not
my
favorite
a
sipper
for
sure
and
one
to
share
with
some
friends
d
this
is
a
ale
you
should
sip
and
savor
over
time
each
sip
brings
a
different
experience
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
enjoy
thats
a
tasty
brew
i
was
very
surprised
to
get
that
smoky
flavor
at
the
end
a
quickly
fading
wine
character
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
given
its
strength
sweetness
if
i
had
more
than
one
available
i
might
go
back
for
more
a
fine
sipper
d
good
its
a
sipper
no
doubt
and
pretty
hot
and
boozy
allaround
but
still
pretty
smooth
barrel
characteristics
are
prominent
sweet
wine
characteristics
with
some
bitterness
its
a
very
unique
sweetness
that
is
coming
off
the
port
overall
more
similar
to
the
caldavos
than
i
was
expecting
this
one
is
definitely
for
sipping
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
just
too
expensive
for
me
to
revisit
again
d
very
very
good
but
only
in
small
doses
the
275
ml
bottle
is
definitely
the
right
size
for
this
brew
too
bad
theyre
so
expensive
even
at
almost
four
years
out
i
think
this
one
still
hadnt
reached
its
peak
yet
either
d
this
was
alot
better
than
i
was
expecting
the
base
beer
is
amazing
but
the
last
one
of
these
i
had
was
more
than
4
times
older
port
barrels
were
a
great
choice
to
age
these
in
id
try
it
again
anytime
too
strong
to
session
check
it
out
d
at
times
i
couldnt
tell
the
difference
between
this
and
the
whiskey
version
in
a
sidebyside
very
sweet
with
lots
of
maple
and
smoked
deli
meat
notes
has
an
added
spicy
quality
albeit
subtle
with
similar
wood
flavors
but
thats
about
it
pulled
some
oak
and
vanilla
as
it
warmed
but
overall
its
too
sweet
for
me
alcohol
is
almost
invisible
which
is
dangerous
super
sweet
sipper
but
very
complex
and
balanced
a
special
treat
if
you
are
in
the
right
mood
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
i
like
the
regular
version
better
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
but
the
thickness
and
the
cloying
sweetness
make
this
a
sipper
and
a
perfect
beer
for
the
275ml
format
i
dont
think
my
palate
could
handle
any
more
d
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sip
with
dessert
theres
no
way
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
due
to
the
alcohol
content
and
amount
of
sweetness
d
the
11
50
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
but
the
sweet
thickness
keeps
this
a
sipper
d
if
i
had
to
choose
between
a
relatively
young
caskaged
version
of
this
beer
and
an
older
version
of
the
base
beer
id
go
with
the
latter
every
time
this
is
nice
but
its
not
in
the
same
league
ive
also
had
a
2005
port
vintage
and
it
failed
to
develop
the
same
oxidation
that
makes
the
base
beer
so
sublime
good
stuff
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
probably
on
the
level
of
gratitude
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
fairly
drinkable
given
the
high
abv
a
great
sipping
beer
on
a
cool
fall
evening
2008
port
cask
vintage
pours
a
one
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
no
lace
cloudy
amberbrown
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
sweet
dark
fruit
nose
flavor
is
sweet
raisins
and
port
not
overly
sweet
like
some
of
the
other
harvest
ales
the
high
abv
is
almost
hidden
pricey
at
9
60
for
a
275ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
just
a
wonderful
beer
with
tons
of
nuance
and
complexities
i
am
glad
i
waited
for
this
to
warm
because
my
review
would
have
been
completely
different
at
a
cooler
temp
i
still
like
the
original
version
better
but
this
is
a
very
close
second
highly
recommended
cheers
d
very
drinkable
given
the
abv
though
prob
not
best
suited
for
a
100
degree
day
like
today
excellent
brew
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
others
in
the
series
and
to
go
out
and
buy
another
one
or
two
to
age
pick
this
one
up
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
just
remember
that
it
is
big
great
stuff
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
come
across
would
love
to
check
out
the
older
vintages
flavor
is
once
again
extremely
sweet
caramel
and
sugar
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
the
thickness
and
maltiness
of
the
body
medium
to
full
body
lots
of
complexity
the
finish
is
again
crisper
and
cleaner
than
the
other
jw
lees
harvest
beers
very
low
carbonation
but
the
beer
tastes
so
good
its
not
hurting
the
beer
that
much
you
can
really
taste
the
results
of
the
port
cask
ageing
torwards
the
finish
of
each
sip
overall
another
great
beer
from
jw
lees
but
not
my
favorite
in
the
line
up
dthis
has
a
great
sweetness
to
it
and
a
ton
of
malt
body
and
flavor
this
is
done
pretty
well
however
the
barrel
aging
doesnt
seem
to
come
through
as
much
as
i
would
have
liked
as
i
really
do
enjoy
a
light
oaky
flavor
it
is
a
little
hot
in
the
back
but
at
11
still
done
very
well
age
has
clearly
been
very
kind
to
this
beer
very
very
impressive
the
palate
opens
big
and
sweet
with
toffee
nougat
honey
buckwheat
honey
and
just
a
touch
of
apple
cider
character
the
port
comes
through
midpalate
with
a
robust
grape
character
mildly
winelike
with
a
little
skinseed
tannic
character
thats
immediately
whelmed
by
the
sweetness
sweet
on
the
finish
this
is
a
decadent
treat
full
in
body
with
a
lowmedium
level
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
exceptional
thank
you
john
this
is
the
third
j
w
lees
ive
had
and
its
another
great
addition
to
the
line
up
id
have
to
say
that
i
prefer
the
regular
harvest
and
calvados
cask
version
to
this
version
but
the
port
cask
version
is
still
pretty
awesome
im
looking
forward
to
trying
some
older
vintages
of
this
in
the
future
d
this
stuff
is
quintessentially
british
im
fighting
off
an
accent
just
sipping
on
this
stuff
this
is
a
very
strong
beer
both
in
smell
and
taste
truly
an
acquired
taste
is
needed
to
thoroughly
enjoy
this
one
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
variously
aged
harvest
ales
this
is
one
helluva
brew
if
it
werent
for
the
steep
price
tag
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
definately
one
of
my
favs
i
highly
recommend
savoring
one
of
these
delights
if
you
can
go
slow
sip
this
one
its
worth
its
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
little
if
any
head
rich
aromas
of
honey
and
dried
fruit
sweeter
than
id
prefer
but
appropriate
for
this
kind
of
ale
needs
a
savory
to
counterbalance
the
sweetness
notes
of
honey
dates
mouthfeel
a
bit
syrupy
but
again
thats
appropriate
for
the
kind
of
brew
a
bit
challenging
but
a
worth
the
effort
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
really
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
really
shows
of
what
an
english
barleywine
can
be
as
the
glass
slowly
empties
i
find
myself
already
missing
the
beer
more
and
more
this
is
one
heck
of
a
special
beer
and
for
far
more
reasons
other
than
its
extravagant
price
tag
beer
most
often
prefers
a
solitary
existence
it
doesnt
usually
get
along
with
other
members
of
the
alcohol
community
j
w
lees
however
gets
along
with
port
just
fine
d
very
very
tasty
but
the
alcohol
shows
through
just
a
little
so
i
cant
drink
them
terribly
fast
theyre
also
very
thick
so
one
is
plenty
for
me
in
an
evening
drinkability
as
with
the
regular
harvest
ale
and
the
sherry
aged
the
sweetness
is
almost
too
much
and
there
are
times
when
sipping
this
beer
is
like
drinking
syrup
but
what
saves
it
is
that
the
beer
is
complex
and
has
the
harvest
ale
characteristic
earthy
bitterness
that
gradually
overcomes
the
sweetness
this
is
a
one
a
night
beer
with
this
abv
and
one
to
be
savored
on
special
occasions
some
day
ill
arrange
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
the
regular
and
all
of
the
barrel
aged
versions
to
be
able
to
directly
compare
and
contrast
them
and
so
better
isolate
out
the
effects
of
the
barrels
overall
this
is
my
second
favorite
of
the
three
ive
had
so
far
behind
only
the
laguvalin
well
worth
a
shot
the
finish
here
is
a
strong
full
body
that
about
knocks
you
over
with
a
warming
booze
side
to
things
the
aromatic
port
notes
hang
in
the
nasal
cavity
as
the
beer
fades
away
this
was
such
a
treat
to
get
my
hands
on
and
such
an
interesting
beer
to
taste
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
another
d
high
for
a
barleywine
cant
get
enough
of
this
stuff
will
have
to
try
other
variations
of
this
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
a
cloudy
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
nice
oakport
notes
getting
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
nice
oakport
notes
and
caramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
i
would
love
to
see
how
the
2008
version
drinks
and
how
some
of
the
other
j
w
lees
barleywines
compare
2006
slight
haze
coppery
amber
colour
with
a
thin
fine
collar
and
a
few
bubbles
floating
atop
the
beer
the
aroma
was
heavy
on
malt
as
expected
for
an
english
barleywine
bready
and
toasted
caramel
and
toffee
port
character
was
nearly
as
strong
with
some
raisin
and
fig
dried
fruit
and
alcohol
up
front
it
was
all
fruit
on
the
palate
very
similar
in
character
to
the
aroma
bready
and
caramel
malts
contributed
sweetness
part
way
through
with
port
and
alcohol
warmth
lingering
in
the
finish
bitterness
was
very
low
full
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
smooth
and
just
short
of
sticky
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
particularly
if
youre
fond
of
port
the
marriage
of
english
barleywine
and
port
casks
worked
wonderfully
at
almost
1ounce
ill
likely
be
avoiding
this
one
and
most
other
jw
lees
that
is
unless
the
price
drops
not
nearly
as
impressive
as
i
had
anticipated
a
very
interesting
and
complex
brew
although
im
not
sure
what
the
deal
is
with
these
tiny
bottles
pours
a
cloudy
golden
amber
color
with
hardly
any
head
at
all
very
thin
and
off
with
white
that
immediately
disappears
with
no
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
overpowered
by
sweet
alcohol
presence
with
notes
of
vanilla
oak
cherry
and
nutty
malt
backbone
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
heat
balanced
by
light
fruit
notes
there
is
just
enough
of
a
malt
backbone
to
balance
out
the
cherry
apple
and
pear
fruit
notes
a
nice
slow
sipping
desert
beer
for
the
winter
months
i
need
to
go
find
some
of
these
for
myself
so
that
i
can
do
a
proper
review
being
as
though
i
had
this
at
a
loud
smoke
filled
bar
2005
vintage
dark
brown
color
with
a
orangish
hue
tons
of
floaties
and
no
head
or
lacing
nose
is
great
toffee
caramel
dark
fruit
raisins
figs
and
butterscotch
taste
is
sweet
toffee
heavy
up
front
mild
carbonation
comes
through
midway
no
hops
detected
and
minimal
alcohol
hard
to
believe
its
11
chewy
mouthfeel
and
sticky
finish
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
and
one
id
buy
again
great
after
dinner
drink
drinkability
is
nice
the
sticky
sweetness
makes
it
a
real
sipper
it
helps
to
keep
the
alcohol
at
bay
not
all
that
balanced
this
might
be
better
with
a
little
more
age
still
as
a
dessert
beer
it
works
pretty
well
asis
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
overall
i
really
am
enjoying
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
it
werent
for
the
higher
alcohol
percentage
for
me
the
taste
is
just
fantastic
there
are
so
many
flavors
going
on
that
complement
each
other
for
me
this
can
do
no
wrong
palate
is
heavy
syrupy
coats
the
palate
delicious
for
what
it
is
but
a
small
glass
goes
a
long
a
way
some
sediment
smell
is
sweet
and
portish
taste
is
extremely
english
and
mellow
but
full
of
flavor
slight
sour
but
not
grabbing
tastes
like
a
drinkable
port
275
ml
9
3
oz
bottle
brewed
in
2006
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangebrown
color
with
pretty
much
no
head
at
all
not
much
lacing
either
it
smells
like
dark
fruit
raisins
figs
brown
sugar
molasses
and
a
bit
of
oakwood
its
a
very
sweet
smelling
brew
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
i
can
taste
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
figs
raisins
oak
butterscotch
and
a
bit
of
port
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
rich
and
a
bit
slick
and
velvety
the
lowmedium
carbonation
makes
this
easy
to
drink
its
a
bit
boozy
but
not
too
much
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
id
buy
this
again
and
ill
try
to
age
the
next
bottle
longer
to
see
how
it
holds
up
over
time
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
theres
no
sign
of
the
port
cask
at
all
youre
still
left
with
some
nice
vintage
jw
lees
harvest
ale
but
the
influence
from
the
cask
is
not
to
be
found
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
this
beer
plenty
of
toffee
and
is
very
subdued
and
smooth
from
the
aging
good
beer
but
nowhere
could
i
find
any
influence
from
the
port
cask
drinkability
wonderful
as
usual
was
nice
to
have
these
in
back
to
back
days
liked
the
calvados
the
best
but
all
were
very
similar
with
the
exception
of
the
lagaluvin
which
was
quite
different
in
barrel
flavor
while
the
alcohol
is
wellconcealed
this
is
of
course
a
sipper
even
if
i
possessed
an
abundance
of
this
one
id
only
have
one
per
sitting
but
thats
how
its
meant
to
be
consumed
its
pretty
similar
to
the
regular
harvest
ale
but
just
an
added
dose
of
the
port
its
not
overly
present
but
i
guess
its
hard
to
be
in
a
beer
that
is
already
as
complex
as
harvest
ale
this
one
that
i
can
rarely
say
is
actually
worth
the
10
per
bottle
cost
wow
this
is
excellent
a
tad
pricy
but
a
quality
barleywine
i
need
another
one
of
these
for
the
cellar
2006
vitnage
poured
oily
copper
darker
than
the
calvados
with
the
same
sparse
ring
of
bubbles
again
it
was
impossible
to
coax
a
head
out
of
the
beer
a
tiny
amount
of
lacing
caramel
and
honey
in
the
nose
less
fruity
but
figs
and
raisins
are
present
more
oak
and
vanilla
in
this
one
much
more
subtle
tastes
than
the
calvados
the
grain
and
malt
of
the
beer
show
through
much
better
the
alcohol
is
up
front
with
the
port
taking
hold
in
the
middle
and
finish
somewhat
vimuous
and
fruity
but
less
sweet
lovely
malt
and
dried
fruit
flavors
blended
nicely
with
toffee
and
butterscotch
less
vanilla
in
the
taste
but
the
oak
shines
throughout
same
lactic
mouthfeel
but
less
stickiness
2006
vintage
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
soft
hazy
caramel
color
with
the
head
of
a
frothy
icedtea
little
to
no
visible
carbonation
like
most
every
other
jw
lees
ive
had
the
aroma
lingers
across
the
table
smells
of
chewy
raisins
and
dark
bead
a
subtle
sweetness
is
present
small
amounts
of
candied
fruits
genius
wow
the
port
really
comes
through
in
the
after
taste
and
mingles
very
well
with
the
barleywine
flavors
on
the
tongue
it
almost
has
an
uncarbonated
soda
sort
of
feel
im
thinking
dr
pepper
or
coke
mostly
malts
sweetness
and
candied
fruits
before
the
port
comes
into
play
top
notch
beer
for
sure
2005
vintage
consumed
dec
2007
pours
a
clear
copper
with
weak
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
fruity
esters
like
fresh
ripe
plums
figs
dates
and
prunes
a
brief
caramel
malt
note
is
noticed
amid
a
background
of
port
and
wood
notes
that
run
the
length
of
the
aromatic
experience
very
nice
smooth
tasting
barleywine
it
seems
to
begin
with
ripe
cherries
sweet
dark
grapes
figs
sugar
coated
plums
and
stewed
raisins
i
then
get
port
mixed
with
maple
syrup
and
wood
the
taste
winds
down
on
the
sweet
side
with
increasing
maple
syrup
alcohol
warmth
wood
caramel
and
residuel
dark
fruity
esters
of
the
four
wines
and
spirits
that
j
w
lees
chose
to
accent
their
outstanding
harvest
ale
my
favorites
are
from
least
to
most
sherry
port
calvados
and
lagavulin
scotch
sherry
cask
and
port
cask
are
spectacular
so
the
final
two
should
be
out
of
this
world
drinkability
is
excellent
i
can
appreciate
this
whole
lineup
but
the
port
cask
is
the
only
one
that
i
really
love
to
the
point
of
catching
myself
drinking
it
too
fast
if
this
wasnt
expensive
and
rare
id
give
it
a
5
scratch
that
this
drink
is
so
good
i
want
to
drink
more
of
it
in
spite
of
its
availability
plus
i
think
it
would
appeal
to
almost
anyone
who
drinks
any
type
of
alcohol
regardless
of
what
they
thought
of
beer
or
were
told
it
was
d
this
stuff
could
not
be
any
better
jw
lees
never
fails
to
amaze
and
this
is
the
best
ive
had
from
them
so
far
perfect
for
sipping
all
night
long
i
like
these
barrel
aged
harvests
but
i
really
prefer
an
bottle
of
the
regular
harvest
with
510
years
on
it
this
ale
is
so
think
on
the
palate
i
almost
need
a
spoon
considering
its
concentration
and
intensity
this
beer
went
down
very
nicely
bottle
poured
a
deep
cloudy
amber
color
ale
with
loads
of
floaters
and
a
small
head
with
minimal
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
consists
of
sweet
malt
with
some
light
dry
fruits
also
discernable
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
sweet
english
style
malt
with
some
notes
of
dry
fruits
such
as
figs
and
raisins
i
was
expecting
port
to
be
more
prominent
but
it
was
very
subtle
full
body
with
limited
filtration
and
some
low
to
medium
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
well
done
overall
even
thought
port
was
not
overly
discernable
poured
a
maroon
and
copper
with
a
small
dirty
head
lots
of
sediment
found
nose
was
sweet
and
malty
with
dark
fruits
and
wallop
of
alcohol
taste
is
exactly
the
same
super
sweet
just
as
an
english
barleywine
should
be
massive
dark
fruit
good
malts
and
plenty
sweet
d
this
is
a
wonderfully
drinkable
sipping
beer
complex
and
delicious
the
port
flavors
work
beautifully
with
the
base
beer
especially
in
the
outstanding
aroma
drinks
easy
but
i
could
feel
the
booze
grabbing
me
from
the
getgo
super
english
barley
wine
from
a
great
english
brewery
about
a
buck
an
ounce
but
a
nice
indulgence
this
has
become
a
favorite
after
discovering
it
while
on
business
in
milwaukee
its
pricey
its
a
small
bottle
but
its
worth
every
penny
poured
into
my
allagash
tulip
glass
i
found
lots
of
floating
yeast
but
it
was
clearly
my
bad
as
i
likely
was
too
aggressive
but
frankly
who
gives
a
shit
with
this
beauty
a
thin
pond
head
but
very
suprising
how
much
yeast
came
out
of
this
tiny
bottle
the
nose
was
awash
with
abundent
dark
delicious
fruitiness
prunes
blackberries
currants
and
licorice
the
taste
was
earthy
and
of
course
yeasty
yet
sweet
like
a
dutch
chicks
mouthfeel
was
full
with
cherry
sweetness
viscous
and
satisfying
very
drinkable
but
too
many
rupies
to
enjoy
as
a
session
brew
but
what
the
f
pony
up
the
bucks
and
have
a
party
highly
recommended
never
a
dissppointment
delicious
and
very
sweet
a
definite
dessert
beer
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
may
be
from
the
port
a
thick
glyceryl
quality
that
im
assuming
is
from
the
port
casks
as
well
as
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
mouth
so
lush
with
dried
cherry
and
other
fruits
fig
paste
orange
marmalade
cream
port
brown
sugar
honey
and
on
and
on
very
complex
and
involving
would
be
difficult
to
drink
many
of
for
the
mere
amount
of
residual
sugar
but
you
sure
as
hell
can
enjoy
a
single
bottle
of
it
rich
lush
middle
and
finish
great
beer
d
an
excellent
dessert
beer
very
good
drinkability
dthe
main
point
of
this
beer
has
been
to
confirm
and
deny
expectations
i
have
to
say
it
works
a
lot
better
with
the
port
barrels
than
the
lagavulin
version
outstanding
and
a
good
match
for
some
lagherino
and
tomme
berger
drinkability
nice
to
taste
but
impossible
to
session
sweetness
and
that
high
11
5
abv
overpower
the
beer
a
big
impressive
taste
but
onedimensional
not
to
be
drunken
lightly
aces
mate
overall
this
is
a
very
intensely
flavored
barley
wine
but
still
nicely
refined
and
wellbalanced
excellent
world
class
winter
beer
i
liked
this
far
more
than
the
lagavulin
cask
and
im
a
scotch
drinker
beautifully
balanced
and
it
really
benefits
from
the
cask
pours
thick
and
sticky
with
a
good
initial
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
it
is
so
thick
and
viscous
that
bubbles
rising
up
almost
look
like
they
are
in
a
lava
lamp
smells
of
very
sweet
malt
up
front
which
blends
beautifully
with
a
ruby
port
finish
taste
is
similarand
exuberantly
sweet
and
liquory
this
could
age
very
very
well
mouthfeelis
creamy
fruityand
big
a
delight
but
it
is
a
huge
fireside
sipper
pours
foggy
brown
nose
is
mildly
sweet
flavor
is
extremely
smooth
firm
sweet
tones
just
unbelievably
smooth
feel
is
smooth
as
well
with
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
caressing
the
tongue
this
is
just
a
magnificent
beer
well
worth
the
coin
i
would
drink
this
every
day
if
there
werent
so
many
other
things
to
try
overall
a
nice
different
drinking
experience
reminds
me
of
both
a
belgian
ale
and
a
smooth
dessert
wine
pours
a
murky
orange
light
amber
color
with
little
head
or
lacing
smell
was
of
caramel
and
belgian
sugars
very
nice
aroma
taste
was
very
good
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
harsh
the
sweetness
is
just
right
not
too
cloying
taste
included
dark
fruit
sugars
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
rich
and
smooth
drinkability
is
good
for
a
barleywine
at
11
5
abv
one
is
enough
for
enjoyment
a
great
nightcap
and
winter
warmer
this
is
a
unique
barley
wine
but
i
dont
think
it
has
quite
the
strength
or
power
of
the
flavor
of
the
lag
whisky
cask
version
pour
murky
amber
and
smells
like
caramel
no
head
at
all
as
expected
and
lots
of
lees
in
the
beer
taste
of
dark
fruits
and
caramel
and
a
noticable
port
cask
taste
good
brew
but
if
you
want
the
full
experience
i
would
get
the
lagavulin
whisky
cask
version
d
having
just
had
a
harvest
ale
i
can
really
taste
the
differences
in
the
port
version
this
one
was
a
bit
sweeter
but
that
could
be
due
to
it
being
3
years
younger
than
the
harvest
ale
single
bottle
from
peace
street
raleigh
drinkability
though
still
admittedly
quite
excellent
the
overall
flavor
doesnt
seem
too
far
removed
from
the
original
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
personal
score
81100
i
will
be
getting
a
case
of
this
to
age
the
next
time
i
have
a
chance
this
beer
feels
wonderful
in
your
mouth
very
creamy
and
thick
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
it
also
leaves
you
with
a
great
warming
feel
amazing
taste
and
the
slight
dryness
to
it
all
keep
you
going
back
for
more
and
more
the
alcohol
doesnt
hit
nearly
as
much
as
the
sherry
cask
harvest
did
even
with
this
being
an
obvious
special
occasion
beer
i
would
drink
this
quite
often
if
it
were
affordable
and
available
bottled
in
2004
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
and
consumed
in
2007
this
beer
pours
a
bright
brown
color
with
ruby
hues
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
a
centimeter
high
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
caramel
dates
black
currants
maple
syrup
a
hint
of
alcoholic
heat
it
is
hard
to
tell
where
the
beer
ends
and
the
ports
starts
as
all
of
the
aromas
i
detect
can
be
found
in
both
the
port
is
a
lot
more
identifiable
in
the
taste
caramel
dates
currants
vanilla
oak
tannins
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
lightly
carbonated
of
silky
smooth
overall
this
beer
in
many
ways
reminds
me
of
averys
the
beast
it
has
its
beer
qualities
but
it
mostly
reminds
me
of
a
dessert
wine
i
like
it
as
i
enjoy
ports
and
dessert
wines
mouthffel
is
full
bodied
and
definitely
on
the
syrupy
side
and
with
the
sweetness
and
the
very
high
alcohol
content
the
drinkability
of
this
one
suffers
a
bit
for
me
pours
with
a
color
like
unfiltered
apple
cider
hazier
than
it
should
have
been
because
i
let
some
yeast
pour
into
the
beer
small
amount
of
head
scent
of
sweet
fruits
raisiny
pruny
sorts
of
aromas
sweet
malt
dominates
the
flavor
again
some
fruit
accents
with
some
candy
sugar
not
much
hop
presence
but
it
isnt
missed
a
wonderful
light
syrupy
feel
in
the
mouth
for
11
5
this
beer
goes
down
quite
easily
a
wonderful
after
dinner
desert
beer
worth
every
penny
even
at
8
dollars
a
bottle
d
well
i
wont
be
drinking
my
other
jw
lees
for
a
years
now
that
was
way
too
sweet
and
apparently
needs
quite
a
bit
more
time
to
chill
the
hell
out
highly
recommended
cant
wait
to
try
the
older
vintages
i
picked
up
i
tried
this
to
see
its
suitability
in
cellaring
i
think
it
would
age
very
nicely
malts
are
a
little
too
pronounced
for
me
definitely
a
huge
british
beer
and
a
great
barley
wine
the
port
touch
adds
a
layer
of
complexity
and
has
kept
my
fingers
busy
unwrapping
chocolate
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
surprisingly
large
head
that
maintains
a
collar
around
the
beer
aromas
caramel
malts
honey
grahams
and
more
than
a
little
winey
fruit
some
savory
spice
and
marshmallow
along
with
a
bright
fruity
candy
note
whose
exact
nature
i
cant
pinpoint
on
the
palate
a
touch
too
heavy
with
huge
thickness
and
stickness
that
crosses
over
into
the
territory
of
cloying
quite
sweet
with
no
discernible
flavor
or
aroma
hops
the
most
dominant
notes
are
those
fruity
winey
notes
plenty
of
sweet
flavors
are
there
too
but
they
are
more
expressive
in
the
nose
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
but
not
up
to
some
of
the
other
jw
lees
cask
offerings
imo
the
fruit
character
is
nice
on
the
nose
but
too
forward
on
the
palate
while
the
other
darker
flavors
i
expect
from
a
wood
cask
are
undeveloped
in
the
taste
department
very
good
but
not
great
taste
is
exactly
what
the
label
says
it
is
the
wonderful
sweet
barleywine
mixed
perfectly
with
the
musky
port
notes
of
the
barrels
caramel
nuts
dark
fruits
simply
wonderful
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
thick
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
a
sipper
in
the
extreme
served
at
cellar
temperature
in
a
snifter
poured
a
beautiful
dark
ruby
reddish
orange
color
with
brown
highlights
a
very
thin
and
loose
head
sat
atop
this
brew
no
retention
no
lace
smell
port
wine
some
short
oaky
tones
cherries
fig
plum
with
some
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
nose
smells
closer
to
a
fine
wine
than
a
barleywine
taste
more
port
wine
oak
slight
oxidation
sweet
dark
fruits
hints
of
malt
and
maybe
a
touch
of
rich
molasses
very
smooth
almost
zero
carbonation
plenty
of
smooth
alcohol
in
the
dry
finish
was
pretty
syrupy
thick
and
full
in
the
mouth
pretty
drinkable
actually
sip
and
enjoy
this
one
i
liked
this
better
than
the
regular
harvest
2004
ale
i
might
be
inclined
to
try
one
of
the
others
like
calvados
drinkability
perhaps
a
tad
sweet
but
nevertheless
a
very
nice
english
barleywine
my
second
favorite
in
the
series
after
the
sherry
casks
drinkability
high
notes
i
did
not
think
once
about
the
11
5
abv
during
the
consumption
of
this
brew
i
am
shocked
that
it
is
that
high
based
on
the
whole
experience
the
only
hint
i
got
was
a
touch
of
warming
after
the
final
pull
and
late
in
the
aftertaste
drinkability
is
amazing
for
such
a
big
beer
a
gem
in
so
many
ways
but
overall
for
my
palate
it
was
above
average
d
the
11
5
is
well
hidden
completely
overshadowed
by
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
i
could
drink
two
or
so
and
really
regret
it
in
the
morning
great
sipper
though
perfection
i
liked
this
and
will
add
a
few
more
of
this
to
my
harvest
ales
in
the
beer
cellar
im
curious
to
see
how
this
improves
over
time
about
as
good
as
a
beverage
can
get
a
serious
winter
warmer
that
has
tons
of
flavor
texture
and
complexity
shows
much
more
port
characteristics
up

than

the

in

will
be
found
in
any
beer
yet
very
smooth
and
delicate
the
feel
is
a
mouthnumbing
alcohol
with
a
light
prickle
from
the
carbonation
a
late
astringency
keeps
this
beer
from
perfection
this
bite
might
come
from
the
unexpected
bittering

is
almost
as

superb
brew
overall
2004
port

as
with
the
fresher
versions
of
the
harvest
ale
and
the
calvados
this
is
also
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
an
interesting
experiment
for
a
beer
that
already
has
a
strong
tawny
portlike
flavor
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
bit
of
overkill
poured
directly
from
the
port
cask
at
spuyten
duyvel
in
brooklyn
i
took
this
one
back
to
my
table
with
trembling
fingers
deep
maple
syruplooking
color
and
serious
almond
maple
port
aroma
and
flavor
there
was
no
head
whatsoever
i
did
enjoy
it
but
the
overall
effect
was
a
bit
cloying
with
all
that
sweetness
of
the
port
added
to
sweet
barleywine
maltiness
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
syrupy
and
almost
sticky
the
port
adds
sweetness
to
an
already
sweet
beer
the
oak
profile
is
big
with
earthy
leafy
tobacco
laden
sugars
mouthfeel
is
full
and
chewy
drinkability
is
as
good
as
that
of
any
beer
aroma
has
a
sharp
apple
pear
fruitiness
along
with
a
stiff
port
smell
and
mild
cocoa
notes
a
redtinged
brown
in
color
with
a
dminishing
finger
thick
head
lots
of
white
fruit
and
chocolate
malt
in
the
fore
with
some
muted
port
notes
and
gobs
of
caramel
notes
coats
the
tongue
with
a
sticky
sweet
film
not
lacking
for
flavor
quite
sweet
though
d
extremely
sweet
lots
o
booze
and
even
more
money
make
this
a
special
occasion
nightcap
at
best
i
love
it
and
think
its
extremely
drinkable
when
i
have
it
which
is
rarely
ever
if
i
could
get
half
a
bottle
for
half
the
price
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time

of

along
with
a
hint
of

overcooked
smores
which
gives
a
suggestion
of
smoke
marshmellow
and
chocolate
wow
i
am
shocked
with
this
one
as
it
really
took
on
the
essence
of
the
barrel
soft
palate
with
an
incredible
diversity
of
flavors
port
wine
flavor
is
discernible
but
pretty
restrained
giving
the
juicy
and
sweet
honeylike
malt
a
very
approachable
midpalate
base
with
toasted
oak
apple
brandy
and
coconut
notes
coming
across
on
the
finish
the

is
most
definately
my
favorite
of
the

smooth
oillike
start
and
finish
with
a

warming
on
the

2
years
and
try
again

at

warehouse
in

this
one
was
good
but
sadly
extremely
overpriced
not
a
very
complex
beer
opt
for
the
sherry
version
if
you
have
a
choice
d
this
is
a
wonderful
barley
wine
but
i
think
that
the
port
adds
a
bit
to
much
sweetness
to
the
already
sweet
bwine
the
others
in
this
limited
series
all
had
nice
compliments
to
off
set
the
sweetness
but
i
feel
that
the
port
cask
adds
more
sweetness
very
nice
aroma
of
a
barleywine
pleasant
appearance
with
lace
alcohol
sweetish
some
rum
figs
vanilla
full
mouthfeel
would
go
well
late
in
a
meal
i
am
encouraged
to
try
the
other
barrels
thanks
tim

i
am
still
tasting
it
a
day
later

after
dinner
beer
go
find
some
and
enjoy
however
i
think
i
would
like
more
balance
in
my
barley
wine
and
as
a
result
i
did
not
find
it
as
drinkable
as
a
mellowed
mature
barley
wine
usually
is
this
beer
looks
just
like
the
others

golden
and
completely
clear
with
a
slight
rosy
color
on
the
head
which
formed
nice
on
a
forced
pour
thick
sweet
and
boozy
the
port
works
really
well

maybe
the
best
so
far
the
oak
brandy
and
grapes
all
provide
a
great
backdrop
to
the
beer
honey
wine
comes
to
mind
immediately

very
sweet
but
not
too
syrupy
this
is
like
a
fine
dessert
wine
with
the
intense
tastes
sweetness
and
satisfying
buzz
delicious
not
sure
how
these
might
age
but
this
one
is
my
favorite
so
far
of
the
series
beautifully
goldenhoneyed
and
clear
carbonation
seen
rising
in
nice
straight
streams
not
much
head
just
slight
bubbly
white
foam
and
then
a
bit
of
a
ring
and
just
clear
clean
aroma
cannot
smell
anything
at
all
really
bit
of
smooth
carbonation
silky
and
smooth
fresh
and
nice
juicy
flavors
apricot
orange
zest
maybe
and
hoppiness
honey
sweetness
and
darkened
caramel
yet
not
cloying
nice
sipper
great
flavor
with
a
lot
to
think
about
and
enjoy
the
flavors
expand
through
your
mouth
and
are
so
enjoyable
shared
this
one
with
my
parents
who
i
recently
went
to
a
port
tasting
with
they
both
really
enjoyed
it
with
mom
commenting
that
she
got
apricot
on
the
nose
with
bitter
on
the
tongue
pours
a
rich
copper
color
that
is
brilliantly
clear
it
is
fairly
well
carbonated
and
is
topped
by
a
frothy
light
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
predominantly
one
of
rich
concentrated
malt
and
hops
but
at
the
end
there
is
an
aroma
of
concord
grapes
and
tannic
red
grape
skins
the
grape
aromas
seem
to
meld
with
the
hop
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
port
like
finish
this
beer
has
a
definite
port
note
to
it
it
doesnt
quite
meld
with
the
beer
aspect
though
the
other
cask
aged
versions
where
better
integrated
though
the
malty
notes
of
this
beer
remind
me
of
caramel
lightly
toasted
biscuits
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
here
in
the
finish
that
melds
with
a
slight
tannic
there
also
seems
to
be
some
subtle
hop
notes
of
pine
and
a
hint
of
citrus
this
is
still
good
just
not
quite
as
good
a
combination
as
the
other
beers
in
this
series
stunning
its
crystalclear
goldenorange
body
resembles
a
glass
of
cognac
and
the
flavors
not
too
far
from
the
same
its
almost
completely
headless
but
some
bubbles
are
visible
slowly
rising
from
the
base
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
rich
with
honeyish
malt
lightly
grassy
and
floral
hops
and
a
slap
of
alcohol
in
the
mouth
its
creamy
and
exceptionally
smooth
with
a
full
body
and
lightly
tinglyrestrained
carbonation
but
its
not
bottle
conditioned
lush
juicy
dripping
honeyish
malt
is
accented
by
lowlevel
notes
of
grassy
hops
and
peppered
with
spicy
notes
of
alcohol
notes
of
port
are
discernable
but
quite
restrained
some
woodiness
does
come
through
however
yet
its
far
from
overdone
and
it
just
lends
enough
character
to
give
it
a
little
life
while
also
helping
it
to
dry
out
in
the
finish
its
not
overtly
complex
but
it
is
exceptionally
rich
and
satiating
superb
light
orange
color
no
head
strong
red
wine
emanations
capture
the
nostrils
fruit
syrup
apricot
pears
make
up
for
a
powerful
liquor
flavour
extremely
sweet
palate
like
apricot
juice
over
an
oxidized
grape
liquor
syrupy
medium
body
contributes
to
the
cloying
aspects
a
more
interesting
drink
than
the
regular
harvest
ale
2003
the
portaged
variant
is
a
bit
rounder
with
less
sharp
initial
bitter
notes
and
a
much
better
aftertaste
not
the
best
barley
wine
ive
had
but
significantly
more
palatable
than
the
plain
harvest
ale
2003
rubybrown
color
smell
isnt
as
strong
as
i
expected
slightly
grapy
taste
is
had
to
describe
very
sweet
sticky
syrupy
sugary
still
a
beer
but
just
barely
more
like
a
liqueur
an
interesting
experience
nonetheless
ill
not
try
it
again
though
the
whiskey
in
the
lagavulin
was
subtle
but
the
port
in
this
one
is
practically
nonexistant
this
is
basically
the
same
sugary
and
alcoholic
beer
that
the
normal
jw
lees
harvest
ale
is
the
clear
red
gold
amber
is
topped
by
a
small
fleeting
white
head
there
might
be
the
slightest
bit
of
grapes
in
the
finish
of
this
beer
its
a
nice
barley
wine
just
like
the
original
but
im
not
seeing
the
cask
aging
having
added
much
to
the
beer
poured
into
a
rapscallion
snifter
formed
a
18
head
over
the
clear
copper
brew
with
slight
lacing
slightly
sweet
malt
aroma
with
fruit
and
alcohol
notes
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
followed
by
the
alcohol
warmth
and
a
discernable
fruitiness
which
i
assume
is
from
the
port
flavor
is
very
complementary
to
the
usual
jwlees
harvest
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
for
the
style
my
favorite
of
the
caskaged
lees
this
sample
was
left
out
on
the
bar
for
10
days
after
which
it
was
consumed
with
great
surprise
and
enthusiasm
the
sweetness
converted
to
pure
molten
glacial
texture
and
the
lack
of
fizz
revealed
a
spicy
sherry
flavor
reminiscent
of
williams
and
humberts
15
year
old
solera
dry
sack
unbelievable
drinkability
outstanding
beer
wonderful
flavor
the
only
drawback
is
the
heaviness
which
would
get
wearing
after
two
or
three
assuming
you
were
still
sober
275ml
bottle
with
black
text
and
a
black
cap
this
one
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
orange
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
quickly
falls
to
a
collar
leaves
a
sparse
lacing
around
the
glass
as
it
is
consumed
the
aroma
had
a
nice
fruity
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
with
the
port
flavors
present
as
well
there
was
also
a
buttery
biscuit
and
yeasty
notes
mingling
with
the
sweetness
the
taste
starts
of
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
that
is
quickly
overcome
by
a
huge
sweetness
a
little
too
much
so
in
my
opinion
there
is
also
a
strong
buttery
flavor
to
this
with
a
slight
nuttiness
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
heavy
with
good
carbonation
i
feel
the
drinkability
was
hurt
as
the
sweetness
became
too
much
even
with
the
smaller
sized
bottle
overall
a
good
beer
though
and
i
shall
pick
another
one
up
to
lay
down
for
a
few
years
backwash
another
example
of
remarkable
craftsmanship
this
is
a
beer
that
can
hold
its
head
high
in
any
company
it
conjures
up
visions
of
the
english
borders
roaring
fires
in
massive
stone
fireplaces
and
a
damp
dog
at
ones
feet
likely
to
improve
greatly
with
further
cellaring
and
well
worth
the
effort
to
find
this
is
what
you
sip
in
the
middle
of
winter
nestled
in
a
huge
cozy
chair
in
front
of
the
hearth
or
spazzing
out
to
your
favorite
metal
band
at
bonerattling
volume
it
will
serve
both
purposes
equally
well
this
beer
ends
up
being
too
one
dimensional
the
amount
of
sugar
overhelms
in
the
beer
and
takes
away
from
any
other
characteristics
not
a
beer
i
was
very
impressed
by
especially
given
the
10
price
for
a
250ml
bottle
sweetness
that
is
quite
unpleasant
and
so
strong
that
it
detracts
from
the
flavors
that
are
more
enjoyable
like
the
vanilla
caramel
and
oaky
barrel
notes
opened
my
first
bottle
today
poured
into
my
teku
glass
this
unassuming
little
bottle
of
beer
is
wonderful
unique
flavors
earthy
raisins
maybe
a
little
apple
wished
i
hadnt
waited
so
long
to
try
it
so
good
i
went
back
and
got
a
second
bottle
bod
2013
pours
a
hazy
medium
amber
with
a
dark
ruby
hue
above
average
head
volume
exceptional
lacing
and
retention
light
nose
of
sweet
fruit
plum
caramel
and
toasted
brown
sugar
over
a
light
sherry
alcohol
note
medium
body
with
a
texture
that
approaches
creamy
below
normal
carbonation
with
just
a
hint
of
effervescence
in
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
very
intense
very
complex
and
somewhat
balanced
considering
the
intensity
it
begins
with
a
malt
bomb
assault
of
sweetness
that
is
caramel
and
toasted
brown
sugar
as
the
sweetness
subsides
it
never
really
leaves
notes
of
plum
emerge
over
a
slight
note
of
nuts
the
middle
is
where
the
alcohol
predominates
with
a
sherry
undertone
over
a
sweetness
that
is
honey
like
the
finish
is
a
slow
fade
of
sherry
like
alcohol
over
a
honey
like
sweetness
the
lack
of
balance
is
what
holds
this
one
back
from
being
outstanding
overall
insanely
good
as
i
was
told
it
would
be
as
the
bruh
that
gave
it
to
me
will
point
out
im
very
open
to
suggestion
when
it
come
to
beer
but
this
really
is
great
tasting
stuff
this
was
my
first
jw
lees
cask
aged
beer
poured
the
entire
bottle
into
into
a
tulip
glass
which
was
probably
a
mistake
significant
amount
of
yeast
ended
up
floating
in
the
beer
the
floating
bits
were
much
more
distracting
than
i
recall
in
other
beers
it
did
effect
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
until
everything
settled
there
is
very
little
carbonation
anyway
so
a
gentle
pour
wouldnt
have
any
real
downside
taste
was
surprisingly
delicate
with
no
sherry
alcohol
burn
caramel
sweetness
upfront
with
a
lingering
sugary
sweetness
heavy
soy
sauce
taste
hit
the
back
of
the
tongue
9

brown
with
a
quickly
fading
small
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
fruit
caramel
and
toffee
notes
with
some
sweet

taste
same
as
aroma
with
some
fine
notes
of
aged

cask
wood
flavors
with
light

notes
and
sweet

palate
is
a
full

and
flavor
smooth
and
sweet
sherry
cask
notes
with
mild
carbonation
finishes
is
sweet
fruity
with
some
nice
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
and
sweet
aged
sherry
cask
woody
notes
with
alcohol
lingering
awhile
overall
a
very
good
flavorful
brew
slightly
hazy
deep
brown
color
with
a
minimal
bubbly
off
white
head
aromas
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
bits
of
fruity
esters
and
a
touch
of
earthy
and
sherry
the
flavor
is
rich
and
sweet
with
caramel
maltiness
offset
with
some
fruity
vinous
notes
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
decent
beer
my
first
time
having
the
sherry
version
i
think
its
either
inferior
to
the
regular
harvest
ale
or
in
a
weird
aging
stage
that
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
before
its
a
stellar
brew
again
im
hoping
for
the
later
and
an
opportunity
to
try
this
again
with
some
more
age
an
absolutely
delicious
complex
beer
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
but
it
really
needs
to
be
shared
with
a
friend
or
two
verticals
make
for
interesting
comparisons
2012
dated
bottle
from
a
trip
to
hoboken
pours
a
deep
orange
red
hue
with
a
tiny
ring
of
white
head
that
fizzes
off
very
quickly
aroma
is
big
sweetness
with
lots
of
sherry
toffee
molasses
maple
syrup
and
a
little
hint
of
fruits
flavor
is
surprisingly
similar
to
the
calvados
cask
a
good
bit
of
bitter
hazelnut
alongside
leather
sweet
caramel
maple
and
brown
sugar
sweet
but
this
had
a
nice
balanced
bitter
and
medium
level
sherry
booze
and
the
sherry
really
accents
this
nicely
sweet
heavy
mouthfeel
but
with
adequate
carbonation
to
keep
this
from
being
syrupy
overall
a
really
nice
treatment
on
this
that
makes
for
a
beautiful
after
dinner
drink
with
a
nicely
complex
flavor
profile
overall
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
bam
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruits
small
hop
presence
and
an
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
dark
fruits
caramel
like
malt
and
a
small
alcohol
presence
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
caramel
and
alcohol
like
aftertaste
big
dark
fruits
caramel
malts
a
small
hop
and
a
nice
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
overall
an
interesting
brew
the
years
have
taken
well
to
this
beer
making
in
a
unique
journey
for
the
palate
i
was
really
surprised
how
pronounced
the
earthy
tones
were
a
lot
of
maple
leafy
greens
and
tobacco
o
excellent
barleywine
at
11
5
im
glad
i
had
this
5
year
old
one
instead
of
fresh
only
aged
barley
wine
ive
had
and
liked
more
was
an
04
stone
old
guardian
tapped
at
the
brewery
new
years
eve
2010
o
this
aged
better
than
the
lagavulin
cask
edition
retaining
some
of
the
barrel
flavors
and
aromas
i
knew
to
be
more
watchful
of
the
sediment
although
i
dont
know
if
that
matters
in
any
way
that
affects
the
flavoraroma
whatever
the
sediment
was
going
to
impart
has
been
long
imparted
a
fine
drink
overall
you
can
taste
the
contribution
of
the
grapes
from
the
sherry
fruit
notes
added
great
but
just
not
as
good
as
the
normal
version
when
aged
pours
an
opaque
orane
color
with
a
creamy
tightpacked
head
not
too
much
of
a
nose
but
a
bit
boozy
and
warm
tastes
sweet
with
caramel
hints
the
boozyness
continues
throughout
but
it
gives
it
warmth
and
isnt
unpleasant
the
beer
isnt
overcarbonated
and
is
nice
its
really
smooth
and
id
enjoy
drinking
this
again
its
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
p
s
my
first
review
please
message
me
if
i
did
something
wrong
o
very
similar
to
the
port
version
only
this
is
slightly
less
sweet
and
syrupy
and
far
more
palatable
its
very
nice
but
not
something
id
drink
often
o
its
just
way
too
damn
sweet
for
me
i
would
have
liked
to
try
the
others
not
sure
if
i
want
to
now
but
maybe
this
is
just
so
sweet
from
the
sherry
overall
good
solid
unique
beer
i
couldnt
name
another
sherryaged
beer
now
just
the
port
version
to
go
looking
forward
to
it
overall
big
beer
a
sipper
a
sugary
sipper
its
complex
though
its
one
of
those
beers
you
can
ponder
for
a
while
maybe
the
result
of
the
pondering
isnt
the
best
but
the
activity
of
drinking
it
is
nice
note
2010
vintage
pours
a
nice
hazy
orangereddish
colour
i
love
the
aspects
of
the
harvest
ale
base
that
are
present
in
the
smell
and
taste
there
was
a
really
nice
amount
of
carbonation
that
balances
out
the
sweetness
of
the
base
nicely
the
sherry
casks
contribution
to
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
well
integrated
and
pleasant
but
i
dont
love
the
contribution
to
the
nose
its
just
a
little
overwhelming
for
me
everything
else
about
the
beer
is
really
enjoyable
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
versions
of
this
beer
a
murky
iced
tea
brown
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
a
thin
collar
surrounds
the
glass
the
nose
is
full
of
sweet
sherry
tobacco
raisins
cocoa
brown
sugar
and
molasses
this
versions
tends
to
enhance
the
sweeter
characteristics
of
the
base
beer
on
the
palate
raisins
and
cocoa
hit
you
up
front
then
a
wave
of
sweet
sherry
with
molasses
brown
sugar
and
dry
tobacco
in
tow
the
finish
is
sweet
and
boozy
full
body
low
carbonation
high
complexity
this
varietal
was
more
enjoyable
than
the
lagavulin
the
sherry
flavorsaromas
imparted
by
the
aging
process
seemed
much
better
incorporated
and
really
enhanced
some
of
the
other
flavors
that
werent
present
in
the
other
version
o
honestly
not
a
bad
variant
the
sherry
is
very
mild
but
it
helps
ease
some
of
the
ridiculously
cloyingly
sweet
molasses
not
to
say
that
its
not
ridiculously
cloyingly
and
syrupy
sweet
just
less
so
overall
too
sweet
for
me
some
very
nice
flavours
but
too
sweet
and
sherry
is
not
one
of
my
favourite
flavours
worth
checking
out
but
i
dont
expect
i
would
buy
this
again
o
this
is
a
fantastic
english
barleywine
and
may
very
well
be
my
favorite
of
j
w
lees
caskaged
ales
definitely
worth
a
try
d
very
drinkable
the
sherry
adds
a
nice
complexity
to
the
base
beer
overall
nicely
bold
and
fairly
balanced
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
brown
sugar
wood
and
sherryalcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
nice
sherry
and
woody
aftertaste
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
features
a
nice
barrel
aged
treatment
originally
reviewed

o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
variants
so
far
i
like
the
normal
harvest
ale
and
love
english
barleywines
in
general
but
for
some
reason
cant
get
into
the
variants
at
all
i
really
dont
think
they
add
anything
good
to
the
base
beer
this
one
had
some
weird
claylike
smells
and
tastes
to
it
id
personally
rank
them
the
normal
harvest
ale
calvados
port
and
then
sherry
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
d
as
i
mentioned
earlier
its
definitely
a
sipper
others
have
mentioned
its
a
good
nightcap
and
thats
exactly
how
im
drinking
it
not
sure
if
im
entirely
sold
on
english
barleywines
but
its
definitely
a
good
beer
just
not
my
particular
style
of
choice
o
damn
j
w
the
whole
series
is
great
from
what
i
have
had
if
you
find
any
of
them
do
your
self
a
favor
and
make
the
purchase
this
as
well
as
the
others
are
very
complex
a
bit
pricy
but
well
worth
it
what
is
even
greater
is
that
you
can
find
bottles
as
far
back
as
2005
i
will
be
seeking
bottles
of
this
out
for
years
to
come
overall
very
nice
better
at
this
age
than
the
port
version
i
recently
had
but
also
has
2
years
age
on
the
2010
port
version
well
see
what
happens
as
this
ages
further
cheers
fantastic
possibly
the
best
ive
tried
in
the
style
though
ive
yet
to
try
any
of
the
other
barrel
aged
versions
of
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
a
slight
haze
and
ring
moderately
sweet
aromas
of
caramel
ripe
pear
and
toffee
with
a
ton
of
oak
and
sherry
character
taste
is
right
inline
with
the
nose
the
oaky
sherry
character
definitely
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
im
getting
a
decent
amount
of
oxidation
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
sticky
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
low
carbonation
overall
a
decent
treatment
of
j
w
lees
but
sherry
already
isnt
my
preferred
taste
so
i
didnt
enjoy
this
as
much
as
the
regular
or
calvados
versions
i
had
alongside
it
notes
darker
sweeter
with
less
sediment
than
the
port
version
of
cask
aged
jwl
harvest
this
is
simply
too
sweet
to
enjoy
yep
this
is
a
good
one
j
w
lees
makes
the
definitive
barleywines
i
really
like
what
the
sherry
casks
add
something
i
would
highly
recommend
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
spend
an
evening
sipping
on
and
enjoying
its
nuances
oan
excellent
example
of
how
barrel
aging
can
add
a
new
layer
to
a
beer
without
disrupting
its
true
character
d
another
interesting
take
on
the
jw
lees
harvest
perhaps
a
tad
richer
than
usual
though
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
the
style
o
overall
this
beer
wasnt
that
bad
nice
appearance
aroma
and
mouthfeel
the
sherry
just
doesnt
work
for
me
i
prefer
the
original
harvest
line
o
this
is
enjoyable
but
id
still
give
the
nod
to
the
port
and
calvados
versions
out
of
all
the
cask
treatments
got
a
pretty
nice
sample
of
this
one
not
too
long
ago
at
the
bethlehem
speakeasy
they
had
just
gotten
a
shipment
in
and
the
bartenders
were
trying
it
and
offered
some
to
me
and
another
gentlemen
who
was
sitting
at
the
bar
at
the
time
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
sampling
snifter
the
beer
looked
like
i
remembered
it
when
i
had
it
a
few
years
ago
the
smell
was
very
sweet
and
quite
inviting
the
taste
is
also
sweet
with
plenty
of
flavorful
malts
and
some
sherry
hints
in
there
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
is
just
like
the
others
minimal
carbonation
but
had
a
great
thick
feel
to
it
overall
this
ones
my
favorite
out
of
all
four
i
dont
really
know
what
it
is
but
i
really
enjoy
this
one
overall
i
tasty
tasty
beer
rich
and
complex
yet
not
flawless
overall
a
great
maltbomb
very
fruity
and
sweet
intense
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
along
with
a
pleasant
woody
quality
quite
and
experiance
a
monster
of
a
barleywine
very
desert
like
almost
like
drinking
actual
sherry
mouthfeel
had
this
the
same
night
as
a
9800
vertical
of
the
regular
harvest
ale
and
while
the
mouthfeel
is
much
nicer
and
much
less
cloying
its
still
in
the
same
boat
something
id
be
more
than
happy
to
have
every
night
in
the
winter
2003
bottle
pours
an
amber
color
with
some
red
color
on
the
outside
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
is
of
sherry
caramel
dark
fruits
cherry
and
some
alcohol
flavor
is
basically
the
same
with
sherry
cherry
dark
fruits
and
plenty
of
caramel
and
sweet
malts
very
delicious
but
i
think
i
still
liked
the
aged
harvest
ale
better

foods
nyc
drink
the
cask
versions
are
very
nice
and
quite
different
from
a
lot
of
things
i
have
had
i
was
particularly
fond
of
this
blend
and
im
hoping
the
whiskey
and
port
will
come
through
as
the
best
two
so
far
275ml
bottle
pours
cloudy
reddishbrown
coor
with
minimal
offwhite
head
its
quite
impressive
to
look
at
the
aroma
is
sherry
booze
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
i
could
smell
it
the
moment
i
popped
the
cap
taste
is
sweet
with
roastedalmost
burntnuts
and
chocolate
a
little
sweet
wine
is
present
also
full
bodied
with
a
sticky
texture
and
smooth
finish
this
is
one
nice
beer
2006
bottle
pours
brown
with
floaties
and
no
head
ehh
smells
like
sugar
apple
caramel
smells
pretty
good
taste
is
very
sweet
and
smooth
in
the
front
very
tasty
up
front
then
the
finish
dries
a
bit
with
a
touch
of
smokiness
though
its
still
sweet
i
cant
help
but
notice
the
ham
flavor
in
the
finish
it
drives
me
nuts
as
it
just
lingers
gross
sugar
just
hangs
out
on
the
tongue
with
a
heavy
mouthfeel
and
almost
no
carbonation
not
very
drinkable
because
of
the
ham
but
definitely
hides
booze
well
the
ham
just
kills
it
for
me
hard
to
get
through
2005
vintage
9
3oz
bottle
pours
a
rusty
brown
color
with
tons
of
sediment
floating
around
thin
layer
of
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
kind
of
smells
like
a
boozey
caramel
apple
strong
alcohol
aroma
flavors
of
caramel
sherry
alcohol
apple
and
slightly
bready
pretty
boozey
tasting
even
with
this
beer
being
less
than
12oz
the
booziness
make
this
a
sipper
for
certain
overall
it
is
an
alright
brew
but
the
price
helps
make
this
time
probably
the
only
time
i
will
drink
it
should
probably
note
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
flavors
imparted
from
cask
conditioning
in
general
but
i
really
love
the
jw
lees
harvest
ale
i
like
j
w
lees
but
i
much
prefer
the
lagavulin
version
this
one
was
my
least
favorite
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sherry
though
i
think
this
one
will
do
you
right
drinkability
is
good
the
sherry
cask
version
has
all
of
the
complexities
that
makes
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
a
great
beer
however
it
is
probably
the
sweetest
of
the
four
variations
which
brings
down
the
drinkability
half
a
point
splitting
a
bottle
with
another
person
is
about
perfect
ill
probably
hang
onto
my
other
bottles
for
awhile
before
trying
it
again
but
this
is
surprisingly
smooth
for
only
2
years
of
age
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
english
barleywines
overall
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
not
my
favorite
of
the
lees
cask
flavors
but
not
my
least
favorite
for
sure
d
in
my
opinion
the
weakest
of
the
jw
lees
barrel
experiments
still
a
good
beer
but
doesnt
reach
out
and
grab
you
or
dazzle
with
its
complexity
im
still
impressed
that
the
base
beer
can
be
improved
upon
by
soaking
up
the
best
characteristics
of
the
barrels
it
is
aged
in
but
these
special
editions
of
harvest
ale
have
certainly
matured
more
than
simply
aged
moderate
body
almost
syrupy
touch
of
resins
gentle
carbonation
for
some
body
very
light
tingle
and
flavor
lift
i
certainly
wont
be
trying
this
again
unless
its
at
50
cents
a
bottle
cause
ill
drink
it
nightly
for
that
the
body
is
thick
but
not
as
syrupy
as
you
might
expect
with
the
sweetness
still
a
chore
to
drink
too
quickly
a
nice
night
cap
beer
or
to
sip
in
a
red
leather
chair
while
contemplating
the
finer
aspects
of
life
drinkability
just
a
superb
english
barleywine
with
incredible
complexity
delicious
beer
yet
too
expensive
good
for
a
special
occasion
this
is
goddamn
barleywine
d
this
quaffable
masterpiece
is
dangerously
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
the
7
years
of
age
has
done
wonders
for
it
its
a
damn
shame
i
only
have
one
2003
vintage
left
in
the
cellar
wow
very
thick
and
full
bodied
mouthfeel
sweet
and
boozy
caramel
like
sweetness
heavy
malts
booze
warmth
slides
easily
down
the
throat
with
a
smokey
finish
this
is
an
incredible
beer
disapointing
version
of
something
i
normally
like
big
full
mouthfeel
but
sourish
aroma
and
only
average
taste
i
cellared
with
for
about
20
months
and
it
has
a
long
shelflife
a
bit
of
sherry
but
not
too
complex
sorry
not
finishable
i
guess
i
am
not
a
sherry
fan
d
strong
a
good
sipper
i
like
this
one
much
more
than
the
whiskey
and
port
cask
versions
d
not
a
quaffing
beer
thats
for
sure
but
for
what
it
is
a
cognacstyle
sipper
its
nice
enough
it
would
probably
take
awhile
to
finish
the
entire
9
oz
bottle
by
myself
but
as
i
split
it
3
ways
i
wouldve
liked
to
have
had
a
little
more
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
very
solid
barleywine
overall
although
not
quite
as
awesome
as
the
regular
and
port
barrel
harvests
in
my
opinion
2004
a
little
hazy

d
i
shared
this

with
a
friend
this
beer
would
be
undoubtedly
cloying
if
i
tried
to
drink
it
all
myself
d
perfect
beer
for
a
cold
january
night
love
the
flavors
from
the
sherry
casks
this
is
a
huge
beer
that
is
not
for
everyone
but
it
was
just
right
for
me
d
not
something
id
grab
for
regularly
but
a
cold
winter
day
is
a
good
catalyst
for
grabbing
it
its
delightfully
intoxicating
and
great
smelling
but
the
heatness
of
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
is
displeasing
taste
was
to
complex
for
my
palatte
after
a
few
life
and
limbs
again
loads
of
boozy
sherriness
tonight
revisiting
this
beer
with
a
bottle
from
the
2007
vintage
very
little
seems
to
have
changed
in
that
the
flavors
are
all
much
as
described
above
while
there
may
be
a
faint
hint
of
oxidations
it
is
quietly
in
the
background
and
easily
ignored
whole
enjoying
the
complexity
of
this
beer
but
ive
also
discovered
that
for
me
theres
not
enough
value
added
from
having
cellared
this
beer
for
the
5
years
since
i
purchased
it
o
great
beer
definitely
worth
the
price
dont
poor
the
bottom
d
for
what
it
is
very
tasty
and
easy
down
poured
into
a
chalice
a
cloudy
light
brownpink
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
very
nice
malty
with
some
sheeryoak
notes
slight

the
taste
is
awesome
malty
sweet
very
nice
woodsysherryoakbourbon
notes
with
some
nice
caramel
thrown
in
medium
body
the
abv
is
hidden
very
well
with
this
brew
very
drinkable
what
an
awesome
brew
highly
recommended
beer
pours
a
deep
raspberry
color
and
surprisingly
pours
very
clear
for
a
barleywine
i
can
only
imagine
that
the
cask
actually
helped
to
clear
this
beer
out
it
pours
with
a
thin
lacing
of
head
that
lingers
for
a
good
long
time
and
leave
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
as
the
beer
empties
the
smell
is
amazing
its
much
sweeter
smelling
than
the
normal
jw
lees
it
smells
of
sweet
alcohol
toffee
berries
and
figs
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
its
a
very
sweet
but
not
annoyingly
sweet
tastes
of
fermented
fruits
are
up
front
that
fade
into
the
heavy
malt
taste
of
the
english
two
row
and
crystal
malts
this
beer
has
a
bizzare
mouth
for
me
its
buttery
and
sweet
with
a
moderate
feel
but
its
still
seems
a
big
thin
for
a
barleywine
once
again
i
would
think
the
cask
thinned
this
beer
out
overall
a
great
beer
incredibley
complex
just
tons
of
flavors
and
layers
going
on
i
enjoy
the
sherry
aspect
of
this
beer
it
adds
sweetness
and
really
makes
the
beer
feel
unique
in
your
mouth
delicious
surprising
that
this
one
still
poured
with
a
1
inch
head
that
lasted
the
whole
time
under
the
head
a
deep
amber
brown
body
complex
aromas
include
vanilla
leather
dark
grapes
and
unlit
tobacco
not
sure
if
i
could
pick
it
out
in
a
blind
tasting
but
i
pick
up
some
sherry
in
the
taste
more
dark
fruits
and
some
molasses
are
present
but
not
overboard
since
its
been
aged
about
5
years
i
cant
tell
its
almost
12
percent
no
abv
is
noticeable
is
the
mouth
not
even
a
tingle
thick
and
creamy
coating
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
an
explosion
of
complex
flavors
every
sip
is
a
taste
bud
orgasm
obnoxious
price
does
not
buy
a
good
review
disappointing
not
recommended
sure
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
it
unbelievably
overpriced
md
still
exceptionally
smooth
a
bit
thinner
than
the
calvados
but
not
as
thin
as
the
whisky
vintage
quite
a
well
crafted
beer
as
all
three
that
i
tasted
are
2007
vintage
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
light
copper
with
no
head
and
lots
of
sediment
it
smelled
surprisingly
similar
to
the
standard
harvest
ale
with
lots
of
sugary
caramel
and
honey
wheat
and
dried
apricot
but
no
real
noticeable
sherry
it
tasted
fairly
similar
to
the
standard
harvest
ale
also
but
not
as
sweet
up
front
it
had
more
oak
character
and
had
a
bit
of
sherry
in
the
aftertaste
it
was
a
little
thicker
than
the
standard
harvest
ale
which
was
nice
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
but
not
terribly
distinguished
from
the
other
j
w
lees
i
didnt
pick
up
on
much
sherry
flavor
or
scent
but
there
was
noticeably
more
oak
from
the
cask
aging
this
rounded
out
the
beers
flavor
balancing
against
the
sweetness
and
hiding
the
alcohol
a
bit
better
so
this
was
easier
to
drink
and
a
bit
more
enjoyable
in
the
end
9
3
ounce
bottle
brewed
in
2006
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
murky
copper
color
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
not
much
lacing
either
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
raisins
figs
sherry
brown
sugar
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
its
very
sweet
and
malty
i
can
taste
brown
sugar
toffee
raisins
figs
molasses
and
sweet
malt
alcohol
is
also
noticable
in
the
taste
but
thats
a
good
thing
for
this
beer
mouthfeelbody
is
full
its
smooth
thick
and
oily
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
enjoyable
to
drink
but
its
a
sipping
beer
for
me
anyway
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
think
ill
have
to
buy
another
couple
bottles
of
this
and
let
it
age
longer
and
see
how
it
turns
out
d
this
is
a
wonderful
sipper
somehow
even
more
palatable
than
j
w
lees
vintage
harvest
ale
i
didnt
think
that
would
be
possible
drinkability
a
bit
too
sweet
this
could
have
been
a
6
or
8oz
beer
and
satisfied
me
just
as
much
huge
flavors
a
dessert
in
its
own
drinkability
is
low
on
this
one
do
i
want
one
hell
yes
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
though
exceptional
beer
d
not
the
biggest
fan
of
barleywines
but
some
of
them
do
taste
rather
well
and
this
one
was
good
d
nice
tasty
treat
i
found
it
vital
to
swirl
this
aggressively
around
the
palette
like
wine
as
it
gives
this
the
recognition
it
deserves

this
is
a
great
brew
and
i
really
dig
the
different

still
its
a
bit
hot
in
the
belly
and
not
my
favorite
of
the
line
up
and
at
the
price
it
commands
not
something
i
will
be
drinking
on
any
kind
of
regular
basis
still
worth
holding
on
to
a
few
for
the
long
haul
and
worth
seeking
out

certainly
never
turn

sweet

with
some
average

and
no
discernable
alcohol
which
is
always
welcome
for
those
barrelaged
beers
well
balance
overall
with
not
too
much
sherry
and
the
base
beer
is
not
too
sweet
well
done
this
is
a
desert
brew
and
should
be
treated
as
such
so
the
12
oz
were
more
than
enough
in
one
sitting
but
i
will
try
this
one
again
this
will
be

on

what
an
amazing
beer
lots
of
sherry
notes
with
dark
fruits
very
sweet
and
cheeky
almost
no
alcohol
detected
all
the
complex
flavours
worked
very
well
with
each
other
one
of
the
most
regal
and
well
made
cask
aged
beers
around
j
w
lees
vintage
harvest
ale
was
reviewed
first
because
i
wanted
to
have
a
baseline
with
which
to
appreciate
the
caskaged
versions
these
special
release
harvest
ales
will
be
reviewed
in
reverse
order
of
my
preference
for
the
wine
or
liquor
sherry
cask
port
cask
calvados
cask
and
lagavulin
whisky
cask
is
it
possible
that
the
other
are
this
amazing
not
my
fav
from
jw
but
still
great
poured
a
nice
brandy
color
with
some
sediment
floating
around
nose
was
of
of
deep
english
malts
earth
tones
and
sweet
smell
of
sherry
taste
is
exactly
the
same
with
dried
fruit
and
perhaps
brown
suar
there
is
alot
going
on
here
and
i
like
it
this
is
an
easy
sipper
and
one
to
enjoy
for
an
hour
very
good
and
one
of
my
fav
jw
lees
oh
and
the
sherry
flavor
comes
through
nicely
even
strongly
if
you
dont
like
sherry
you
wont
like
this
luckily
sherry
is
one
of
the
few
stronger
liquors
that
i
like
and
also
being
into
barleywines
it
seemed
a
winner
before
even
popping
the
top
it
couldve
still
gone
very
wrong
in
the
hands
of
a
lesser
brewer
but
no
this
is
great
stuff
for
slow
sipping
and
quiet
contemplation
it
was
a
real
treat
though
to
catch
at
the
beginning
of
the
blossom
it
packs
a
mean
punch
has
started
to
fruit
up
and
still
has
the
structure
of
a
big
beer
i
am
always
amazed
at
the
staying
power
of
these
beers
at
year
five
it
was
aged
enough
to
enjoy
yet
still
tight
enough
to
command
respect
a
true
treat
that
is
a
definite
sipper
i
will
seek
more
of
these
out
and
buy
them
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
i
do
like
the
sherry
flavor
but
unfortunately
it
doesnt
really
do
enough
to
buoy
the
leaden
sugars
that
overwhelm
this
beer
nor
is
it
interesting
enough
to
warrant
those
sugars
or
the
big
abv
for
that
matter
i
suppose
this
deserves
some
points
for
its
totally
undetectable
alcohol
but
then
again
a
little
spicy
heat
might
help
to
fence
in
its
outofwhack
sweetness
i
think
i
can
safely
say
this
is
on
of
the
best
barrelaged
beers
ive
ever
tried
clearly
top
quality
oak
was
used
i
hate
the
use
of
oak
chips
im
cellaring
one
of
these
for
sure
bravo
to
j
w
lees
once
again
proving
why
they
are
one
of
the
worlds
best
breweries
a
very
unique
experience
but
one
im
probably
not
going
to
go
to
repeat
at
this
price
point
i
am
not
reviewing
this
beer
as
an
english
barleywine
alone
but
one
aged
in
a
sherry
cask
duh
2006
vintage
pours
a
dark
orange
straw
color
with
little
head
and
no
carbonation
smells
intensely
like
sherry
vanilla
nutty
orange
and
alcohol
amazing
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
and
oily
somewhat
sweet
with
a
noticable
amount
coming
from
the
malts
not
as
much
sherry
in
the
mouth
as
in
the
nose
taste
is
still
nice
and
nutty
vanillay
and
orange
a
nice
woody
aftertaste
was
my
personal
favorite
sensation
of
this
beer
first
sip
is
a
bit
of
a
palate
shocker
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
or
enjoys
sherry
may
throw
some
unsuspecting
person
off
track
a
wonderful
experience
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
d
this
one
would
be
great
while
reading
a
book
sitting
in
front
of
the
fireplace
i
would
like
to
try
all
of
the
different
harvest
ale
casks
overall
i
felt
this
was
average
or
a
bit
above
for
me
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
am
just
not
overwhelmed
by
the
jw
lees
selections
personal
preference
i
guess
but
this
one
just
falls
back
with
the
others
for
me
at
least
not
bad
if
its
your
thing
i
guess
d
this
is
really
one
of
the
best
dessert
drinks
i
have
ever
tasted
an
awesome
beer
that
i
would
highly
recommend
pours
a
clouded
orangecopper
hue
the
flavor
profile
on
this
was
nice
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
spice
but
there
was
just
no
complexity
to
things
here
really
its
just
a
straightforward
sweet
tone
that
delivers
no
real
character
feel
is
smooth
it
certainly
is
drinkable
but
i
remember
the
port
cask
version
being
a
much
more
interesting
beer
than
this
nice
to
drink
but
lacking
some
finesse
2005
vintage
pours
thich
and
viscous
a
bit
hazy
but
a
nice
dried
apricot
color
little
head
even
with
a
hard
pour
and
beyond
an
initial
fizzing
it
fades
completely
im
not
too
concerned
given
the
style
and
abv
the
sherry
finish
on
this
beer
really
lends
quite
a
bit
to
the
style
the
sweet
malt
blends
beautifully
with
the
slightly
nutty
vinous
sherry
this
isnt
surprising
considering
that
sherry
casks
have
become
all
the
rage
for
finishing
scotch
especially
the
slightly
sweeter
maltier
ones
it
works
the
sweet
malt
is
up
front
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
followed
by
the
nice
sherry
notes
of
almonds
light
fruit
and
salty
caramel
everything
blends
harmoniously
and
the
finish
and
mouthfeel
are
smooth
and
rich
without
being
unctuous
the
vinous
flavors
really
cut
through
the
malt
and
make
this
very
drinkable
there
is
no
hint
of
the
high
abv
a
stellar
after
dinner
sipper
onedimensional
but
still
impressive
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
complex
taste
and
sweet
demeanor
kind
of
heavy
but
drinkable
nonetheless
the
vintage
i
tried
was
2003
the
color
was
a
bright
orangeamber
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
large
snifter
and
i
lifted
the
btl
high
above
the
glass
to
force
a
small
one
inch
head
some
patchy
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
nose
was
sweet
dark
fruits
and
a
little
barnyard
mustiness
the
taste
started
off
with
dark
dried
plums
and
raisins
with
a
light
sour
taste
that
fades
into
a
sweet
honeyvanila
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
beyond
silky
it
is
down
right
syrupy
the
drinkabilty
a
slow
sipping
desert
treat
the
alcohol
is
very
present
thruout
the
journey
even
with
5
years
of
aging
this
one
could
be
rested
several
more
years
the
body
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
it
had
an
oily
texture
very
drinkable
beer
in
reasonable
amounts
dont
see
this
beer
aging
much
more
than
it
already
has
though
like
all
other
j
w
lees
harevest
ales
this
one
is
also
a
joy
and
privilage
to
drink
on
a
lazy
saturday
night
reading
some
homebrew
books
and
sipping
on
this
english
barleywine
its
a
good
night
the
beer
begins
with
the
expected
maltysweet
aroma
with
slight
hints
of
hops
ripe
or
overrippened
fruits
and
a
light
peppery
alcohol
note
in
the
nose
aromas
are
quite
similar
to
1year
standard
harvest
ales
the
flavors
follow
up
on
the
heavy
sweetness
but
a
tawny
port
winelike
woodyness
booziness
and
mustiness
soon
follows
none
of
these
sherry
notes
dominate
the
beer
but
add
just
a
hint
of
added
variety
the
hops
are
still
young
and
overbearing
and
will
need
some
time
to
simmer
but
the
beer
is
still
sublime
the
feel
is
a
weighted
sweetness
that
at
times
show
syrupy
textures
and
at
others
a
rich
maltiness
the
hops
add
a
distracting
bitterness
metalic
and
bitey
feel
that
will
fall
out
over
the
next
year
or
so
overall
the
beer
is
terrific
but
is
still
quite
young
and
has
some
maturing
to
do
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barley
wine
the
sherry
cask
aging
does
not
contribute
odd
or
gamey
flavors
as
sometimes
happens
with
caskaged
beers
worthy
of
a
place
of
honor
in
any
collection
overall
really
tastes
more
like
a
scotch
ale
than
a
ebw
to
me
pure
malt
sweetness
and
too
strongsweet
for
anything
more
than
slow
sipping
finally
i
have
to
factor
in
the
price
in
the
over
all
enjoyment
i
doubt
this
beer
will
find
a
spot
as
a
regular
in
the
beer
enjoyment
line
up
as
an
occasional
treat
perhaps
this
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
the
head
is
very
small
an
recedes
into
nothing
within
seconds
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
choke
cherries
dates
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
strong
sour
cherry
notes
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
velvety
smooth
and
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
i
am
not
overly
impressed
with
its
flavor
profile
however
it
should
probably
be
taken
into
account
that
i
am
not
a
huge
sherry
fan
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
would
much
rather
have
the
port
aged
version
definitely
a
sipper
like
its
calvadoscask
aged
cousin
this
one
is
if
you
can
believe
even
more
sweetly
vanillay
drinkability
just
fine
the
beer
pours
an
impressive
interesting
color
of
cloudy
amber
brown
with
a
hint
of
orange
while
there
is
not
much
head
what
there
is
lasts
and
lasts
and
the
lacing
is
superb
the
beer
has
a
huge
nose
of
honey
brown
sugar
cocoa
and
melon
this
beer
smells
incredibly
rich
and
sweet
with
almost
a
drambuie
aroma
just
incredible
the
beer
tastes
every
bit
as
wonderful
as
it
smells
and
is
very
rich
and
sweet
i
get
flavors
of
vanilla
chocolate
melon
and
bacon
fat
incredibly
decadent
beer
the
beer
has
a
long
lingering
finish
and
on
the
palate
it
is
very
rich
plush
and
smooth
the
abv
is
noticeable
and
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
the
beer
is
so
flavorful
you
hardly
notice
the
acohol
the
only
thing
that
really
detracts
from
the
drinkability
is
the
sweetness
after
a
while
it
started
to
get
to
me
a
bit
however
this
is
one
outstanding
beer
from
j
w
lees
i
like
this
beer
alot
but
not
for
any
long
term
drinking
amount
of
rs
in
this
will
make
it
an
easy
hour
and
a
half
sipper
however
it
has
good
complexity
and
really
lets
you
relax
somewhat
balanced
though
in
good
english
tradition
towards
the
malt
hops
are
backseat
drivers
alcohol
is
a
big
presence
but
for
a
seven
dollar
bottle
you
expect
it
to
go
a
long
way
fine
brew
pretty
heavy
bodied
didnt
really
notice
any
carbonation
very
syrupy
as
well
lingers
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
while
this
was
very
tasty
and
refreshing
the
high
alcohol
makes
this
a
very
specific
occassion
ale
almost
felt
like
a
waste
not
being
able
to
share
it
with
others
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
each
sip
very
impressive
2003
edition
pours
a
brandy
colored
dark
copper
with
a
few
small
islands
of
thin
head
floating
on
the
top
this
one
needs
a
snifter
and
presents
well
in
my
maudite
smells
of
super
sweet
malts
old
wood
earthy
musk
dark
fruit
alcohol
taste
is
exactly
the
same
super
sweet
just
as
an
english
barleywine
should
be
massive
dark
fruit
sweet
candy
im
gonna
get
diabetes
from
drinking
this
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
slick
and
it
is
easy
to
sip
slowly
on
a
cool
evening
wish
i
had
a
fire
going
poured
in
a
snifter
this
beer
boasts
a
dark
red
body
with
such
a
little
tan
head
that
quickly
shrinks
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
of
big
sticky
malts
huge
sweet
fruit
notes
little
to
no
hops
present
at
all
the
taste
has
faint
alocohol
notes
with
a
huge
malt
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
a
lifesaver
pleasant
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
large
amount
of
residual
sweetness
and
a
slight
alcohol
warming
sensation
this
is
a
sipping
beer
that
would
pair
wonderfully
with
a
big
blue
cheese
stilton
anyone
pours
a
four
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
very
little
lace
cloudy
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
very
heavy
bodied
sweet
sherry
nose
flavor
is
sweet
sherry
cloying
but
easy
to
drink
pricey

malt
character
not
forward
enough
the
barrel
character
somewhat
unpleasent
and
the
hops
kind
of
rotty
tasting
a
real
shame
for
the
price
i
appreciate
some
of
the
figgy
nuts
and
almonds
brought
in
by
the
barrel
but
i
dont
think
the
beer
reacted
well
mostly
too
sticky
otherwise
clean
pours
an
orangereddish
color
much
lighter
than
expected
hardly
any
head
to
speak
of
but
it
does
seem
to
have
a
very
slight
carbonation
nose
is
a
wonderfully
sweet
grain
just
a
hint
of
the
oak
and
sherry
cask
creamy
rich
mouthfeel
wow
almost
chewy
flavors
are
more
subtle
than
anticipated
sweet
maple
with
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
pears
so
smooth
thick
full
body
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
this
was
one
of
the
more
satisfying
and
enjoyable
beers
i
have
had
in
some
time
grab
one
to
sip
by
the
fire
after
a
long
days
work
and
a
hearty
meal
2004
bottling
poured
into
a
snifter
reddish
brown
with
almost
no
head
sweet
fruit
sherry
scents
flavors
are
similar
lots
of
sweet
caramel
very
understated
hop
bitterness
sweet
flavor
predominates
silky
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
mostly
present
as
a
warming
factor
but
extremely
understated
in
the
flavor
i
had
this
beer
for
dessert
tonight
and
it
fills
that
role
perfectly
a
true
sipping
beer
one
to
savor
for
as
long
as
possible
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beers
you
wont
like
this
one
but
i
do
and
this
one
is
exceptional
a
fireside
sipper
that
should
be
savored
on
a
winters
night
a
classic
english
bw
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
will
add
this
to
my
harvest
ales
in
the
beer
cellar
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
improves
over
time
d
the
ale
weighs
in
at
over
10
making
drinkability
difficult
add
to
that
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
intense
alcohol
of
the
sherry
and
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
overall
2004
sherry

as
with
the
fresher
versions
of
the
harvest
ale
and
the
especially
the
calvados
this
is
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
own
personal
taste
profile
nice
enough
but
just
a
little
heavy
on
the
syrupy
sugary
sweetness
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
head
that
has
no
staying
power
aromas
indicate
sweetness
candi
sugar
and
spice
with
a
macallan
sherry
bite
on
the
palate
sweet
sherry
flavors
come
out
first
follwed
by
figs
and
sugared
pears
hot
alcohol
and
a
dirttobacco
finish
but
not
one
thats
overdone
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
smooth
except
for
the
finish
which
runs
too
hot
to
be
called
smooth
sticky
overall
a
bit
too
simple
compared
to
the
other
jw
lees
barley
wines
the
sherry
seems
to
have
robbed
this
beer
of
some
of
its
complexity
still
its
a
very
decent
beer
this
is
a
great
sipping
english
barley
wine
but
it
very
sweet
and
full
of
potent
rich
flavors
that
may
be
too
much
after
a
glass
tastes
of
oaked
sherry
and
vanilla
flavored
caramel
covered
biscuits
covered
with
toffee
and
tobacco
mouthfeel
is
thick
viscous
and
chewy
drinkability
is
as
i
expect
from
any
jw
lees
harvest
ale
the
sherry
dominates
the
aroma
but
you
can
smell
lots
of
caramel
beneath
it
red
tinged
amber
in
color
this
beer
appears
vaguely
luminescent
there
is
just
a
slight
filmy
white
slick
of
a
head
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
but
the
outer
edges
are
a
uniform
dime
sized
thickness
fore
is
very
sweet
with
caramel
sugar
and
cream
there
are
subtle
woody
notes
in
the
middle
and
the
finish
is
again
very
sweet
with
rich
caramel
and
candy
sugar
notes
im
starting
to
dig
english
barley
wines
oh
yeah
i
forgot
to
mention
beer
isnt
sherry
okay
drinkabilty
for
the
strength
but
a
few
more
years
of
aging
are
in
order
imho
light
rust
with
pink
accents
and
a
small
and
mostly
lasting
head
of
foam
strangely
lighter
in
color
compared
to
the
brown
colored
original
jw
lees
harvest
ale
deeply
malty
aroma
showing
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
toasted
bread
along
with
infused
sherry
barrel
aromas
sherry
vanilla
wood
and
a
suspicion
of
honey
and
strawberries
rich
full
nutty
and
caramel
laden
fruit
flavors
coat
the
palate
while
the
barrel
certainly
did
mellow
this
out
quite
a
bit
providing
notes
of
sherry
vanilla
and
wood
this
really
is
very
elegant
and
complex
and
the
flavors
are
so
ever
changing
mothfeel
a
little
too
tart
for
my
liking
the
finish
at
least
but
the
gradual
build
up
to
the
sherry
like
finish
was
pretty
cool
very
syrupy
mouthfeel
drinkability
man
this
is
fantastic
what
a
treat
worth
seeking
out
and
enjoying
one
of
the
most
enjoyably
complex
beers
ive
ever
had
d
for
as
nice
as
this
beer
is
as
an
afterdinner
cordial
the
sherry
casks
add
little
to
the
flavor
other
than
huge
sweetness
as
opposed
to
the
lagavulin
casks
which
added
some
interesting
peat
and
smoke
notes
i
am
beginning
to
realize
that
the
jw
lees
line
of
harvest
ales
should
be
purchased
forgotten
about
for
many
years
and
then
opened
up
once
theyre
reached
a
more
satisfying
level
of
complexity
overwhelming
palate
overload
good
god
what
is
this
is
this
a
barleywine
or
a
bad
sherry
or
a
dessert
port
definitely
a
dessert
beer
this
is
an
instance
of
something
that
was
good
product
and
having
what
seems
like
is
a
great
idea
but
it
backfires
poured
brown
with
a
slight
red
tinge
it
to
slight
bubbly
head
on
top
nose
is
like
a
glass
of
sherry
or
port
wine
flavor
is
all
the
wine
with
a
slight
hop
kick
towards
the
end
the
bittersweetness
also
provides
a
slight
curl
to
the
taste
very
heavy
in
the
mouth
and
oilyalmost
greasy
definitely
a
slow
sipping
dessert
beer
aging
in
a
sherry
barrel
destroys
this
as
a
decent
barleywine
pours
from
the
funky
old
wooden
cask
dark
and
muddy
no
head
nor
lace
seems
to
have
very
minimal
carbonation
nose
is
funky
musty
fruity
wine

you

bw3
appearance
is
a
nice
deep
mahogany
with
a
little
bit
of
foam
at
first
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
smell
is
sweet
a
few
different
types
of
sweetness
combine
to
create
a
pretty
sickeningly
sweet
smell
of
course
the
usual
jw
lees
toffee
and
caramel
smell
is
very
strong
in
there
and
there
is
a
little
bit
of
malty
sweetness
but
there
is
also
a
strong
maple
syrup
type
smell
and
the
sherry
cask
they
aged
this
in
must
have
been
an
extremely
sweet
sherry
because
it
has
a
very
strong
influence
on
this
beer
there
is
also
a
powerful
spiced
rum
smell
in
there
the
smell
is
very
much
in
your
face
and
powerful
but
not
appetizing
at
all
to
me
taste
is
cloyingly
sweet
as
expected
there
is
some
definitely
depth
and
complexity
here
and
im
sure
this
is
probably
what
the
brewers
intended
to
achieve
with
this
combination
but
i
can
hardly
stomach
it
right
now
this
is
more
rich
and
sweet
than
almost
any
dessert
ive
ever
tried
hardly
any
balancing
bitterness
in
this
one
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
and
slippery
without
any
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
great
i
finished
my
10oz
goblet
and
decided
that
i
could
potentially
enjoy
it
with
dessert
but
i
definitely
wont
be
ordering
one
again
d
this
is
a
very
nice
barley
wine
and
the
slight
sherry
notes
really
add
a
lot
of
depth
to
this
beer
but
it
didnt
taste
overly
sweet
275
ml

this
beer
pours
out
a

color
with
a
small
head
sweet
caramel
aroma
with
dark
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of

this

is
pretty
good
but
in
no
way
is
it
in
improvement
on
the
original
j
w
lees
the
sour
aspect
is
annoying
make
sure
to

at

warehouse
in
charlottesville
va
a
great
beer
worth
every
penny
on
cask
at
the
bw3
in
indy
this
beer
pours
a
radioactive
red
color
with
a
slight
showing
of
a
head
atop
the
glass
there
is
a
bit
of
lacing
as
well
aroma
was
sweet
and
nutty
at
first
then
i
notice
vanilla
and
a
woody
component
enter
sherry
shows
itself
along
with
cherries
and
finally
a
little
alcohol
kick
really
complex
aroma
i
picked
up
something
new
each
time
i
whiffed
taste
is
just
as
complex
i
was
continually
picking
up
new
flavors
theres
a
main
dried
fruit
aspect
to
this
beer
that
holds
the
sherry
in
and
lets
it
be
more
noticeable
apricots
and
cherry
are
there
more
toasted
caramel
along
with
a
roasted
cashew
taste
alcohol
and
sherry
flavor
become
more
dominant
in
the
finish
but
neither
overbearing
the
rich
body
supports
these
flavors
well
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
sipper
maybe
one
of
the
few
perfect
after
dinner
drinks
imo
this
specially
casked
harvest
ale
pours
a
deep
auburn
body
with
amber
and
gold
highlights
beneath
an
average
sized
head
of
creamy
offwhite
froth
the
head
retention
is
limited
but
at
11
5
thats
to
be
expected
and
it
still
keeps
a
decent
collar
which
is
unusual
for
such
a
high
alcohol
beer
the
nose
is
loaded
with
sweet
delicately
caramelized
malt
and
notes
of
stickysweet
dried
dark
fruit
as
well
as
some
leafy
and
almost
herbal
hops
theres
no
particular
evidence
of
either
sherry
or
wood
but
it
is
somehow
lighter
or
less
malty
than
the
regular
version
in
the
mouth
its
full
bodied
almost
to
the
point
of
being
syrupy
smooth
and
quite
creamy
its
rich
maltiness
dominates
the
flavor
with
a
sticky
honeylike
character
thats
balanced
by
herbal
leafy
and
grassy
hops
the
sherry
comes
through
midway
across
the
palate
with
a
spritz
of
fruitjuice
and
alcohol
the
bitterness
is
lowkey
but
has
enough
ballast
enough
to
balance
it
the
sherry
comes
through
again
in
the
finish
lending
it
just
a
little
more
complexity
than
the
original
but
of
the
four
specially
casked
versions
this
is
one
of
the
less
interesting
with
port
being
the
other
the
clavados
and
lagavulin
were
actually
interesting
thanks
to
clvand0
for
sharing
this
beer
pours
vibrant
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
light
coat
over
the
brew
its
a
very
pretty
color
the
nose
is
rumraisin
and
some
vinous
grapeyness
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
full
the
raisin
is
more
sweet
and
less
like
dried
fruit
there
is
also
a
thick
molasses
sweetness
the
flavors
are
well
rounded
and
blended
well
i
enjoy
it
no
real
hint
of
the
alchohol
the
feel
is
incredibly
thick
even
syrupy
very
oating
drinkability
is
okay
as
well
smooth
and
tasty
its
a
sipper
good
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
comprised
of
a
raisin
essence
but
i
dont
get
much
else
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
some
slight
raisin
notes
and
a
little
sweetness
the
finish
is
really
drying
i
dont
get
much
of
the
sherry
flavor
in
this
one
very
tasty
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
what
i
wanted
it
to
be
the
1997
vintage
is
still
the
best
of
these
that
ive
had
the
body
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
just
ok
sweet
caramel
malt
loads
of
fruit
lemon
rind
light
touch
of
earthy
hops
sweet
finish
medium
bodied
very
gentle
carbonation
after
trying
the
other
3
cask
aged
versions
i
figured
this
one
could
use
a
little
time
to
sit
i
guess
that
might
not
have
been
the
case
fairly
clear
orange
with
a
light
tan
head
that
quickly
bubbles
down
leaving
no
lacing
very
strong
syrupy
sweet
aromas
some
vinous
and
buttery
notes
were
there
but
overpowered
for
the
most
part
by
the
sweetness
taste
upon
first
sip
was
way
too
sweet
light
fruitiness
and
more
syrupy
sweet
flavors
follow
light
buttery
notes
before
the
sweet
finish
cloying
but
still
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
sticky
sweet
drinkability
not
good
at
all
it
was
hard
enough
drinking
this
bottle
let
alone
ever
wanting
another
one
oh
well
maybe
this
might
have
been
better
earlier
drinkability
dont
go
crazy
with
this
one
as
with
many
of
the
classic
big
ales
this
one
is
best
savored
in
moderation
the
mix
of
nuttiness
from
the
sherry
and
vanilla
notes
is
really
quite
nice
this
beer
is
a
nice
dessert
beer
and
even
reminds
me
of
a
liquor
with
its
alcohol
notes
in
the
finish
this
beer
has
some
serious
malt
notes
as
well
it
tastes
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
toffee
this
beer
as
one
would
expect
is
rich
and
filling
it
is
quite
thick
and
almost
coats
my
mouth
i
really
like
the
extra
dimension
that
the
sherry
adds
to
this
beer
golden
amber
liquid
wears
no
head
oxidized
wine
aroma
where
floral
undertones
come
hidden
under
strong
alcoholic
suggestions
and
milder
bread
ones
light
liquorice
and
wood
hints
taste
contains
a
mild
grape
tartness
that
is
overshadowed
by
a
strong
dry
wood
character
sometimes
reminiscent
of
paper
bitter
alcohol
finish
imparts
an
appealing
though
rough
cigarlike
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
full
bodied
clear
and
dark
golden
wit
not
much
head
only
a
dusting
with
some
swirling
itsy
bitsy
bubbles
in
a
thin
ring
at
the
edge
wonderful
scents
of
whiskey
going
on
or
maybe
rum
makes
me
think
of
drinking
a
rum
and
coke
bit
of
some
dark
fruits
and
maple
syrup
or
dark
karo
syrup
very
nice
wow
this
is
so
thick
and
creamy
but
not
heavy
just
smooth
and
lovely
there
is
a
bit
of
bite
from
the
carbination
i
am
surprised
by
the
caramelly
sweetness
that
the
sherry
brings
tastes
of
a
cream
sherry
and
oakyness
blackened
toast
in
the
aftertaste
after
each
taste
there
is
a
bit
of
both
the
dark
and
the
sweet
nice
there
is
so
much
wonderful
flavor
in
this
man
i
was
scared
that
this
would
not
live
up
to
what
i
was
hoping
it
would
taste
like
i
love
the
taste
of
cream
sherry
yeah
so
sue
me
it
is
fun
chilled
with
a
wedge
of
lime
every
once
in
a
while
pull
out
the
harveys
glad
that
this
turned
out
to
be
as
good
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
maybe
not
a
session
beer
but
a
wonderful
sit
down
and
relax
and
sipper
enjoyed
this
one
alot
especially
after
the
crappy
birds
game
today
this
really
took
the
edge
off
beer
is
good
happy
beering
i
may
like
this
one
the
best
of
the
four
barrelaged
harvest
ales
its
the
same
gorgeous
amber
glow
with
the
wispy
white
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
oak
the
flavor
is
sugary
sweet
just
like
the
rest
of
them
with
a
touch
of
slightly
overripe
peach
supporting
it
i
can
actually
taste
a
bit
of
the
wood
from
the
barrel
and
a
slight
winelike
character
from
the
sherry
this
flavoring
from
the
barrel
is
subtle
but
not
as
subtle
as
the
rest
a
fine
barleywine
but
the
sweetness
like
in
the
rest
makes
it
a
definite
slow
sipper
i
had
to
gag
this
down
to
finish
2003
sherry
this
is
the
second
one
i
tried
after
the
calvados
the
look
and
rich
thickness
were
identical
the
taste
was
much
different
the
alcohol
was
not
as
powerful
and
there
was
a
pleasant
dried
plum
sweetness
that
makes
you
forget
what
you
are
drinking
the
sweetness
lingers
in
a
way
that
can
be
over
the
top
but
it
is
a
very
good
mind
numbing
drink
also
6
99
in
nj
poured
into
a
rapscallion
snifter
formed
a
18
head
over
the
clear
copper
brew
with
slight
lacing
slightly
sweet
malt
aroma
initially
quickly
overpowered
by
alcohol
notes
with
some
fruity
components
as
well
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
followed
by
the
alcohol
warmth
and
a
tad
of
fruitiness
at
the
end
i
assume
from
the
sherry
cask
but
hardly
noticeable
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
for
the
style
not
much
different
than
how
i
would
present
a
rating
for
regular
harvest
not
much
effect
from
the
sherry
cask
in
my
book
i
think
it
gets
hurt
on
drinkablilty
though
this
is
a
rare
treat
but
i
couldnt
see
it
as
an
everyday
drinker
they
managed
to
make
this
ale
delicate
in
its
flavors
rather
than
just
slapping
you
in
the
face
with
barrel
taste
it
was
rather
buttery
as
a
side
note
but
not
like
a
california
chard
scorched
pecans
hazelnuts
and
walnuts
on
the
nose
fold
into
concentrated
butter
maple
and
pound
cake
aromas
on
the
palate
it
is
sweet
and
fabulously
rich
in
a
viscous
oilytextured
way
that
is
not
quite
accounted
for
by
its
evident
residual
sugar
nor
any
flavor
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
it
is
supported
by
seed
oilflavored
bitterness
reminiscent
of
arsenicladen
apricot
and
peach
pits
overall
a
stupendous
beer
i
have
2
of
each
of
these
fellows
and
look
forward
to
trying
each
of
the
others
to
compare
really
the
only
gripe
and
i
hesitate
to
call
it
a
gripe
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
nuttiness
that
i
was
not
expecting
backwash
when
venom
first
posted
these
upcoming
arrivals
i
hustled
to
the
local
store
that
carries
a
good
range
of
b
uniteds
products
it
took
some
wheedling
but
they
eventually
got
it
in
now
that
ive
opened
one
i
bought
2
of
each
variety
ill
have
to
find
more
id
love
to
find
a
place
that
offered
this
on
draught
from
the
wooden
casks
fantastic
and
ages
splendidly
after
two
sips
i
found
it
necessary
to
throw
out
the
remainder
of
a
10
9
3
oz
bottle
which
doubly
disgusted
me
the
beer
looks
nice
aside
from
a
bunch
of
unfiltered
crap
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
really
nice
as
well
but
thats
about
the
end
things
to
say
about
this
beer
the
faint
tobacco
aroma
that
was
appealing
on
the
nose
becomes
offensive
when
tasting
tasted
like
old
cigarette
butts
mixed
with
other
garbage
probably
due
to
poor
storage
of
a
5
year
old
beer
i
just
bought
it
about
a
month
ago
nevertheless
one
of
my
few
drain
pours
a
really
good
and
interesting
barley
wine
o
a
fantastic
representation
of
an
english
barleywine
the
sweetness
in
particular
lends
itself
to
drinkability
even
with
the
pronounced
alcohol
bite
you
would
expect
those
two
things
to
clash
with
one
another
but
this
brew
shows
how
the
two
can
coexist
in
harmony
2006
edition
super
sweet
and
wonderful
i
am
really
learning
to
appreciate
barleywines
these
age
so
well
strong
this
was
but
it
never
felt
overpowering
it
was
so
sweet
and
had
just
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
in
it
while
leaving
a
nice
slick
aftertaste
that
the
potency
of
this
ended
up
taking
a
backseat
its
so
rare
to
find
a
beer
that
pushes
the
edge
of
what
a
beer
can
be
while
still
remaining
true
to
form
which
was
the
case
here
thoroughly
enjoyable
while
still
being
a
new
experience
for
me
this
is
a
brew
that
should
be
on
everyones
musttry
list
especially
if
some
warmingup
is
called
for
this
winter
great
stuff
heard
a
lot
of
hype
on
this
one
had
a
2008
bottle
and
just
felt
that
ive
had
much
better
barleywines
no
disrespect
to
j
w
this
vintage
has
clearly
aged
marvelously
its
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
everything
intensely
in
moderation
tried
many
vintages
a
few
up
to
15
years
aged
nice
mahogany
color
with
beige
head
smells
of
toffee
and
malts
taste
is
silky
toffee
and
caramel
finish
thin
and
sweet
aroma
if
raisins
molasses
toffee
honey
taste
sweet
honey
toffee
burnt
smokey
caramel
i
believe
it
was
a
5
year
old
bottle
possibly
3
just
not
particularly
good
heavy
on
the
long
leaf
chewing
tobacco
overall
rich
complex
smoky
o
amazing
so
far
this
one
has
trumped
all
other
barley
wines
that
ive
had
o
if
you
find
this
in
stores
do
not
let
the
smaller
size
deter
you
great
things
come
in
small
packages
this
is
9
3
ounces
of
awesome
2008
vintage
noticed
sediment
as
pouring
then
afterwords
saw
the
most
concentrated
yeastbeermix
ive
ever
seeneventually
settled
out
for
the
most
part
smells
insanely
sweet
of
toffee
and
fruit
ive
not
had
an
english
barleywine
where
the
dessertcake
aspect
was
so
intense
massive
cocoa
and
fruitcake
and
oh
so
much
more
accompany
the
consistent
ring
of
lacing
that
follows
the
9
25
oz
or
whatever
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
alcohol
hardly
noticeable
a
fine
beer
completely
different
than
anything
ive
ever
had
the
one
id
recommend
to
illustrate
the
difference
between
an
english
and
american
take
on
what
a
barleywine
ale
is
o
not
recommended
a
brilliant
british
barley
wine
with
distinctive
fruity
and
nutty
traits
extraordinaire
beer
a
sweet
malty
sipper
with
great
complexity
bold
but
still
mellow
highly
recommended
if
you
are
into
barley
wines
this
was
in
perfect
condition
after
roughly
eight
years
i
cant
wait
trying
one
much
younger
and
another
one
older
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
spent
8
50
on
it
and
i
was
satisfied
definitely
a
sweet
sipper
for
a
special
occasion
i
havent
had
this
before
now
but
i
suspect
the
age
did
this
beer
wonders
very
satisfying
overall
if
you
like
sweeter
barleywines
quads
and
dopplebocks
do
yourself
a
favor
and
grab
this
purchased
three
bottles
2008
2007
2006
a
couple
years
back
and
have
aged
them
in
my
proper
beer
cellar
since
then
cracked
them
all
open
last
night
all
three
were
flat
overly
sweet
and
metallic
tasting
they
did
not
age
well
at
all
i
bought
them
at
a
decent
price
so
no
big
loss
but
i
expected
more
since
this
was
a
beer
that
the
label
says
can
be
laid
down
for
years
bottle
from
tipples
112012
release
pours
murky
reddish
orange
as
all
the
versions
do
with
essentially
no
head
at
all
on
top
beautiful
aroma
of
toffee
figs
pears
plums
sweet
caramel
smells
rich
and
sweet
flavor
is
a
beautiful
nutty
toffee
fruit
flavor
pecans
and
caramel
galore
with
an
extra
sweet
fruit
character
like
pears
and
figs
really
nice
sweet
full
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
a
very
nice
beer
overall
a
nicely
aged
barleywine
that
id
love
to
revisit
if
given
the
chance
i
wanna
say
a
little
more
age
would
do
nicely
decent
flavor
just
way
too
sweet
for
me
ooverall
a
great
barleywine
a
must
get
a
classic
for
a
reason
overall
i
wish
this
came
in
bigger
bottles
though
if
it
did
come
in
bigger
bottles
the
night
could
end
badly
for
me
love
this
stuff
overal
the
aroma
matches
the
taste
for
the
most
part
picked
up
more
earthy
hops
on
the
back
of
the
palate
that
i
couldnt
detect
with
the
scent
nice
bittersweet
and
caramel
finish
after
beginning
with
tons
of
malt
and
dark
fruit
flavors
this
is
my
first
try
at
this
barley
wine
and
am
interested
in
how
it
evolves
from
year
to
year
overall
i
really
have
no
idea
what
this
beer
is
like
fresh
but
at
this
age
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
especially
for
the
price
i
trust
that
littles
cellared
this
beer
properly
so
i
dont
think
that
is
the
issue
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
at
its
price
10
for
less
than
10oz
but
im
still
glad
i
experienced
this
old
of
a
brew
to
date
this
is
the
oldest
aged
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
after
submitting
usually
only
check
rating
after
reviewing
there
seems
to
be
a
ton
of
pdev
on
this
beer
probably
due
to
pushing
it
past
its
limits
maybe
this
beer
is
only
meant
to
be
set
aside
for
a
couple
of
years
and
not
a
half
to
a
whole
decade
just
my
two
cents
i
guess
i
also
questions
j
w
lees
i
know
brewing
over
seas
is
based
more
on
tradition
but
why
not
try
waxing
or
corking
a
beer
that
everyone
is
so
eager
to
age
again
just
my
two
cents
the
smell
and
initial
taste
are
great
the
finish
is
not
which
kinda
spoils
the
beer
which
is
unfortunate
cause
i
can
imagine
how
awesome
this
beer
could
be
o
great
evening
beer
use
this
as
a
nightcap
to
sip
on
its
rich
and
packed
with
a
bunch
of
nice
mellow
sweet
flavors
in
the
end
the
beer
lacked
a
bit
of
complexity
for
me
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweetness
and
it
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
i
just
wish
there
was
maybe
more
carbonation
or
drying
or
something
to
separate
from
simply
sweetness
it
still
surely
hits
its
alcohol
though
o
overall
a
very
well
rounded
brew
with
an
awesome
flavor
a
warming
abv
but
none
of
the
unpleasant
after
effects
of
many
other
brews
definitely
worth
aging
for
years
to
come
i
have
two
one
i
will
crack
open
in
another
5
years
or
so
enjoy
a
little
thin
english
barleywine
vs
american
barleywine
so
far
the
winner
is
american
but
this
is
okay
they
could
have
used
a
12
oz
bottle
though
and
a
little
overpriced
o
really
great
if
you
like
barleywines
you
will
probably
like
this
11
5
abv
is
always
a
plus
when
its
this
good
o
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
without
the
belgian
yeast
plenty
of
dark
fruit
and
malt
with
an
oaky
rummy
undertone
pretty
nice
sipper
overall
looks
fine
in
the
glass
light
carbonation
has
a
pleasant
smell
of
malt
id
expect
from
a
barleywine
the
taste
starts
there
with
nice
notes
of
sherry
and
fig
from
there
it
goes
to
smokey
and
leathery
notes
and
finally
leaves
you
with
what
i
imagine
licking
an
ash
tray
must
taste
like
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
an
astonishingly
complex
beer
though
perhaps
a
touch
sweet
for
my
tastes
would
work
well
as
an
after
dinner
drink
perhaps
even
splitting
the
small
bottle
between
two
people
i
had
the
last
few
ounces
with
a
cigar
which
worked
very
well
and
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
is
is
so
different
than
any
other
beers
ive
had
ive
only
had
an
american
barleywine
and
it
didnt
really
impress
me
i
prefer
malty
ales
so
i
figured
that
i
would
prefer
english
barleywines
this
was
my
first
and
it
will
be
hard
to
beat
overall
it
is
a
greattasting
brew
i
finished
the
whole
750
cc
by
myself
in
2
hours
but
its
really
a
dessert
beer
a
finely
crafted
english
barleywine
and
despite
its
intimidating
11
5
abv
its
comparable
easy
to
drink
bottled
2002
intense
dessert
ale
aromas
of
toffee
and
caramel
slight
musky
funkiness
flavor
of
dried
fruit
and
caramel
still
sweet
and
syrupy
could
only
drink
about
5
oz
at
a
sitting
it
became
rather
cloying
near
the
end
of
the
glass
reminded
me
of
a
good
sherry
and
tawny
port
combined
o
this
is
a
very
sweet
and
intense
english
barleywine
and
is
definitely
one
that
needs
to
be
sipped
slowly
considering
the
high
abv
and
the
not
all
that
well
hidden
alcohol
9
3oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
small
quickly
fading
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
malt
very
fruity
esters
a
bit
of
banana
note
up
front
yeast
and
dark
fruit
notes
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
mild
chocolate
malt
very
fruity
with
some
dark
dried
fruit
a
kind
of
fermented
grapes
flavor
yeast
almost
brandy
like
with
some
cask
and
wood
flavor
palate
is
a
medium
to
full
body
smooth
and
creamy
slightly
sweet
cloying
mouth
feel
finish
is
same
as
taste
no
need
to
repeat
it
all
with
a
lingering
sweet
caramel
and
mild
sweet
alcohol
flavors
overall
a
good
yet
complex
nose
and
flavored
brew
has
a
nice
after
taste
good
after
dinner
brew
with
a
sweet
dessert
o
an
elegant
and
balanced
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
dessert
beer
keep
in
mind
its
a
bit
sweet
even
for
an
english
barleywine
there
is
a
nice
complexity
to
the
malt
profile
overall
i
havent
had
anything
like
this
before
a
really
nice
and
unique
barleywine
thanks
again
rodkin
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
now
lucky
to
have
this
on
tap
o
well
its
everything
a
dessert
barleywine
should
be
big
rich
complex
and
decadent
however
even
at
9
3
oz
this
is
best
split
between
two
people
due
to
how
cloying
it
is
compare
that
to
say
sucaba
which
i
can
finish
a
750ml
bottle
of
with
little
trouble
absolutely
worth
trying
just
dont
drink
it
before
dinner
o
perhaps
just
as
good
as
the
caskaged
editions
but
i
have
only
had
this
and
them
after
some
aging
not
sure
how
this
would
taste
fresh
i
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
the
aforementioned
versions
having
sampled
the
lagavulin
cask
2011
and
2007
calvados
cask
version
2006
and
sherry
edition
2011
and
2007
perhaps
i
expected
less
or
perhaps
the
aging
wore
away
the
casks
flavorings
this
was
a
very
elegant
drink
i
initially
employed
a
gentle
pour
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
potential
lees
but
to
no
avail
i
was
still
getting
a
murkiness
with
floaties
so
i
went
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
used
a
heavier
hand
resulting
in
a
quickly
disappearing
finger
of
lighttan
head
and
a
lot
of
floaties
it
really
depends
on
how
much
such
things
bother
you
as
far
as
which
style
of
pour
to
utilize
i
suppose
color
was
a
murky
deepamber
with
loads
of
evident
floaties
nose
was
enough
to
make
me
want
to
pay
homage
to
my
sinuses
for
finally
clearing
up
holy
dried
dark
fruit
batman
this
smelled
of
raisins
prunes
worn
leather
tobacco
a
newspaper
mustiness
and
alcohol
heat
jeezus
my
first
sip
was
thick
and
viscous
and
sat
on
my
tongue
like
a
big
glob
of
something
that
i
might
not
want
to
swallow
the
taste
was
sweet
and
smoky
and
my
first
thought
was
s
clyde
weavers
sweet
lebanon
bologna
finish
was
still
sweet
and
smoky
but
now
with
a
tobaccolike
smokiness
like
i
had
partaken
of
a
stogie
double
jeezus
i
almost
wish
that
i
had
purchased
more
than
one
but
how
many
of
these
types
of
beers
do
i
have
left
in
me
overall
this
feels
like
a
beer
i
should
be
sharing
with
friends
to
celebrate
a
special
ocassion
now
i
understand
the
jw
lees
following
and
price
tag
this
is
in
my
personal
beer
hof
this
great
brew
has
diminished
into
a
flat
sweet
syrup
with
almost
no
hint
of
booze
i
would
like
to
try
it
after
2
years
but
this
makes
me
question
whether
cellaring
a
brew
for
7
years
is
even
worth
it
i
have
only
had
3
beers
now
that
have
been
cellared
for
over
5
years
and
this
is
the
only
one
i
know
was
far
over
the
hill
live
and
learn
o
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
to
see
how
the
hops
integrate
with
the
other
flavors
but
this
was
a
very
tasty
brew
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
although
i
havent
had
it
fresh
this
definitely
seems
like
a
beer
that
ages
gracefully
would
be
curious
to
see
how
older
bottles
are
doing
t
tons
of
honey
right
off
the
bat
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
mixed
in
with
the
honey
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
fig
jam
and
grape
jelly
mouthfeel
is
honeylike
as
well
super
thick
without
really
feeling
heavy
i
dont
know
if
that
makes
sense
but
thats
the
best
i
can
put
it
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
ever
had
o
an
interesting
and
mostly
enjoyable
beer
overall
im
not
completely
used
to
the
style
so
its
pretty
different
for
my
palate
ive
had
a
couple
of
ports
lately
which
this
reminds
me
of
a
lot
there
is
a
lot
going
on
and
its
difficult
to
nail
down
specific
flavors
have
just
had
a
2001
bottle
that
was
a
very
different
experience
to
the
2006
gloriously
wellbalanced
with
a
wonderful
prune
and
plum
taste
the
marmite
flavour
was
barely
present
and
generally
it
was
much
less
cloyingly
sweet
just
shows
what
wonders
age
does
for
this
beer
originally
rated
this
as
a
4
but
the
2001
was
a
worthy
4
75
o
really
good
this
style
could
be
the
start
of
a
beautiful
freindship
o
really
pleasantly
surprised
was
half
expecting
soy
sauce
given
first
whiff
and
13
years
and
3
moves
over
the
years
wonderful
gentle
slow
slipper
will
look
to
cellar
these
again
in
the
future
2008
vintage
not
sure
what
the
big
deal
is
here
this
is
just
a
really
sweet
yeasty
alcoholic
monster
pouring
a
glittery
golden
color
with
a
ton
of
coagulated
yeast
sediment
and
a
minimal
white
head
the
nose
is
very
sugary
honey
sweet
sticky
and
yeasty
some
fruit
notes
up
front
in
the
taste
alcohol
wipes
out
any
other
potential
subtleties
all
i
taste
is
booze
and
sugar
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
from
mid
sip
onwards
really
syrupy
in
feel
not
much
carbonation
and
more
residual
sugar
that
i
can
handle
without
turning
diabetic
long
teeth
coating
finish
overall
not
my
favorite
stuff
here
not
worth
the
price
or
the
hype
maybe
another
decade
would
make
this
a
star
but
im
just
not
feeling
it
here
this
is
my
first
venture
into
jw
lees
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
sweet
bif
box
from
nlmartin
thanks
again
buddy
i
will
definitely
be
looking
out
for
other
vintages
but
i
dont
know
how
any
other
year
could
be
any
better
12
years
of
age
set
the
bar
very
high
o
one
helluva
beer
i
prefer
less
dark
fruit
and
more
caramel
personally
but
damn
this
works
so
well
as
it
is
an
obvious
classic
best
beer
i
have
had
in
ages
wonderful
to
be
savoured
o
this
was
definitely
a
treat
that
held
up
amazingly
well
with
time
there
was
some
oxidation
and
not
much
carbonation
but
neither
of
those
took
away
from
the
overall
taste
there
were
a
lot
of
great
dark
fruit
tastes
going
on
that
balanced
very
well
with
a
sweet
maple
syrup
quality
i
definitely
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
and
its
one
of
the
best
english
barleywines
ive
had
i
definitely
recommend
laying
one
down
in
your
cellar
and
trying
it
again
in
a
decade
overall
its
a
good
one
sweet
but
not
harsh
after
taste
has
a
nice
finish
i
havent
enjoyed
a
sweetness
like
this
since
the
last
sauterne
i
had
with
a
danish
blue
cheese
and
white
grapes
nonblind
comment
this
was
08
vintage
by
the
way
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
its
just
too
sweet
for
me
to
enjoy
and
i
love
malt
forward
beers
just
as
much
as
anyone
o
3
o
i
think
this
could
have
used
even
more
years
in
the
cellar
it
was
quite
good
but
too
sweet
imo
this
would
be
perfect
with
a
creme
boule
or
fine
dessert
amazing
beer
through
and
through
this
is
an
awesome
barleywine
i
recommend
it
to
sip
by
the
fire
while
narrorating
a
classic
english
novel
just
be
careful
because
this
beer
is
still
very
smoothe
4
5
d
really
enjoyed
this
im
going
to
have
to
pick
up
a
few
to
age
opaque
orangebrown
appearance
with
absolutely
no
head
the
smell
is
reminiscent
of
raisins
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
quite
fruity
with
a
bit
of
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
thing
lacking
in
this
beer
since
it
has
nearly
zero
carbonation
right
out
of
the
bottle
doesnt
bother
me
too
much
since
it
should
only
have
a
little
to
begin
with
overall
a
great
beer
ill
be
getting
a
few
more
of
these
to
age
these
were
two
of
the
most
complex
beers
i
have
come
across
equally
delicious
with
the
1998
edging
the
1999
by
a
thin
margin
smooth
complex
rich
sweet
simply
incredible
seek
out
the
older
vintages
overall
good
but
a
disappointment
perhaps
tap
is
not
the
way
to
have
this
beer
but
i
found
it
was
all
power
and
no
subtlety
taste
is
a
delicious
blend
of
various
malt
flavors
from
caramel
to
toast
to
honey
to
even
a
little
hint
of
chocolate
thick
sweet
and
syrupy
but
strangely
never
gets
cloying
as
the
alcohol
dries
things
out
nicely
on
the
finish
i
did
the
jw
lees
thing
a
little
different
as
i
have
had
two
of
the
flavored
cask
versions
prior
to
the
regular
i
think
i
enjoyed
the
cask
ones
slightly
better
but
not
by
much
this
is
a
real
treat
i
wish
this
was
sold
in
tx
id
love
to
have
a
case
or
two
of
these
to
drink
over
the
next
few
years
note
since
the
2004
seemed
to
be
more
of
what
this
beer
is
really
about
i
weighted
the
final
score
based
on
that
experience
more
than
the
2008
overall
a
really
great
take
on
the
barleywine
very
thick
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
great
mix
of
flavors
the
beer
is
a
murky
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
a
bit
oxidized
but
a
really
nice
caramel
and
dark
fruit
aroma
good
brown
sugar
and
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
flavor
is
also
slightly
oxidized
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
great
brown
sugar
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
a
nice
bit
of
cherry
and
plum
to
go
with
raisins
oeasily
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
had
one
and
this
was
the
best
occasion
to
open
it
on
i
wish
i
had
a
case
more
i
will
be
aging
the
rest
of
them
as
long
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
rich
sweet
malt
backbone
with
a
great
balance
of
sugars
and
dark
fruit
flavors
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
and
some
light
applelike
fruit
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
and
some
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
full
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
quite
strong
and
rich
and
has
a
better
smell
than
taste
in
my
opinion
o
excellent
beer
if
given
the
opportunity
to
try
this
it
is
a
must
this
joins
the
list
of
great
barleywines
that
ive
had
with
abacus
king
henry
and
mother
of
all
storms
whoa
serious
beer
poured
this
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
small
foamy
head
that
promptly
disappeard
and
no
lace
color
is
a
hazycloudy
amber
brown
with
a
lot
of
sediment
aroma
is
a
very
volatile
blend
of
caramel
yeast
malt
dark
ripe
fruit
raisins
bread
dough
and
seemingly
many
other
things
flavors
like
nose
with
sweet
out
front
along
with
curiously
a
little
chili
pepper
bitter
a
little
behind
that
and
just
a
smidgen
of
carbonic
tang
body
is
full
and
lush
with
some
little
bitter
points
that
just
contribute
to
the
beautiful
picture
carbonation
is
a
little
tame
but
it
works
finish
does
get
a
little
boozy
but
overall
is
pleasant
and
on
the
long
side
outstanding
beer
overall
almost
got
a
headache
right
away
from
the
sweetness
this
one
is
definitely
unique
and
somehow
complex
in
the
finish
despite
the
overwhelming
tart
and
sweetness
i
couldnt
finish
this
one
o
its
fun
to
have
such
a
vintage
beer
the
oldest
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
sample
the
beer
is
a
bit
over
the
hill
in
my
opinion
its
enjoyable
to
sample
but
not
a
vintage
ill
see
out
in
the
future
overall
i
can
only
hope
some
more
years
of
aging
will
do
this
nicely
maybe
dry
it
out
a
bit
i
love
the
flavors
but
they
get
masked
by
the
sugars
omay
be
my
new
favoite
ever
tastes
like
adam
oxidized
and
sweet
very
good
o
this
beer
is
quite
possibly
one
of
the
most
complexand
dare
i
say
itand
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
myriad
of
flavors
is
truly
unbelievable
and
i
cant
even
imagine
what
this
would
be
like
if
it
were
cellared
for
two
or
three
years
even
i
will
definitely
be
buying
a
bottle
of
this
and
keeping
it
for
as
long
as
i
can

o
a
little
overly
sweet
but
the
body
and
falvors
in
this
beer
is
like
no
other
barlewine
i
have
ever
had
believe
i
have
a
2002
which
i
hope
is
near
as
amazing
as
the
1999
if
not
for
the
dirtashtray
taste
it
would
have
lived
up
to
its
hype

pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
dark
khaki
head
with
decent
retention
that
reduces
to
a
ring
of
lace
as
expected
some
slight
bits
of
lacing
on
the

aromas
of
huge
caramel
molasses
biscuit
wood
toffee
raisin
earth
whiskey
chocolate

slight

lingering
notes
of

butterscotch
on
the
finish
for
a
good
while
insane
complexity
balance
and
smoothness
with
no
cloying
sweetness
at
all
despite
this
being
a
100
malty
beer
light
carbonation
and
full
bodied
with
an
absolutely
beautiful
creamy
slick
and
thick
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
insanely
well
hidden
with
no
warming
noticed
at
all
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
cant
even
consider
drinking
this
fast
at
all
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
mind
blowing
barely
wine
that
was
pushing
10
years
old
i
will
not
turn
down
purchasing
older
vintages
of
this
in
the
future
absolutely
fantastic
paired
with
a
steak
culotte
my
drinking
buddy
noted
hes
getting
a
balsamic
vinegar
type
taste
here
sweet
and
dark
and
i
dont
disagree
the
steak
and
leaks
have
a
great
flavor
and
pair
wonderfully
apparently
steak
culotte
is
a
very
difficult
meat
to
cook
and
ive
never
had
it
still
rare
in
the
middle
this
meat
is
really
melt
in
your
mouth
good
the
food
has
been
out
of
this
world
do
far
ladies
and
gentlemen
here
you
have
it
my
first
and
probably
only
perfect

perfect
pairing
setting
look

taste
and
feel
its
like
ive
reached
a
plateau
i
hope
im
wrong

lastly
i
cant
even
begin
to
thank
jw
lees
enough
maybe
1
person
will
read
this
or
the
other
reviews
here
and
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
this
beer
is
special
at
9
99
bottle
its
bargain
priced
if
ever
in
my
life
a
firkin
comes
near
albany
ny
again
ill
be
there
cheers
to
all
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
aged
english
barleywine
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
see
this
potentially
really
enhancing
a
dessert
or
maybe
helping
with
a
tough
cheese
i
recommend
trying
this
if
you
are
looking
for
authentic
styles
o
this
is
not
a
beer
for
me
at
least
not
now
way
too
sweet
and
malty
for
my
tastes
ill
finish
the
bottle
because
it
is
small
and
was
expensive
d
absolute
drain
pour
i
have
to
think
there
was
something
seriously
wrong
with
this
bottle
overall
an
excellent
aged
english
barley
wine
a
rare
treat
that
should
be
enjoyed
i
was
planning
to
do
a
vertical
from
1999
to
2011
but
now
think
the
beers
should
be
enjoyed
in
smaller
groups
over
longer
periods
of
time
this
is
truly
excellent
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
can
appreciate
the
smokiness
and
aging
of
the
beer
but
the
flavors
just
didnt
seem
to
come
together
well
for
me
there
are
several
lessexpensive
alternatives
in
the
style
that
i
enjoy
a
lot
more
id
have
to
do
a
vertical
to
get
more
perspective
but
this
is
fantastic
like
a
fine
porto
o
i
certainly
had
higher
expectations
for
this
but
that
odd
green
pepper
taste
really
threw
things
off
for
me
ill
definitely
have
to
grab
another
bottle
and
see
if
it
is
consistent
throughout
batches
or
just
this
bottle
overall
a
true
malt
bomb
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
superb
definitely
one
to
enjoy
slowly
in
front
of
a
fire
o
quite
good
a
very
nice
sipper
that
was
a
perfect
end
to
the
evening
i
can
see
why
people
like
to
sit
on
these
i
can
see
this
beer
mellowing
a
bit
over
time
not
that
the
alcohol
was
a
problem
on
the
flavor
profile
wow
this
was
good
maybe
the
quintessential
english
barleywine
here
this
just
brings
in
droves
of
complex
flavor
to
the
senses
with
a
heavy
yet
still
approachable
alcohol
presence
to
it
i
think
that
i
tend
to
enjoy
this
bear
a
little
fresher
before
too
much
heavy
sweetness
sets
in
having
this
on
cask
was
a
real
treat
and
one
of
the
true
highlights
of
the
fest
for
me
d
almost
drinks
like
a
mead
very
sweet
but
super
complex
great
range
with
sweet
nutty
slightly
roasted
aromas
and
flavors
my
favorite
beer
of
the
evening
1
of
the
4
tried
overall
i
cant
drink
anything
this
sweet
it
tastes
like
sweet
raw
sugar
toffee
with
chocolate
mixed
with
yodels
of
yeast
that
ate
sugar
without
oxygen
for
10
years
its
thick
and
chewy
and
it
feels
like
itll
put
hair
on
your
nuts
it
makes
black
coffee
a
bitchs
brew
im
definitely
affected
by
the
world
class
bro
and
other
reviews
as
ill
score
it
high
with
no
plans
to
revisit
its
just
too
big
for
me
overall
impression
wow
just
when
i
had
an
unreal
barleywine
last
week
with
the
commander
this
one
becomes
one
of
my
new
favorites
the
fruit
and
fig
characters
that
i
sought
out
stayed
with
me
in
both
glasses
a
very
strong
brew
too
after
drinking
these
i
was
surely
intoxicated
and
had
to
ask
for
my
tab
i
highly
recommend
the
2010
harvest
ale
if
you
get
a
chance
not
sure
about
the
other
years
or
the
variety
of
cask
offerings
for
the
2011
line
up
but
this
was
out
of
this
world
o
drain
pour
09
and
10
coming
up
soon
so
well
see
how
they
stack
up
so
lucky
to
have
this
on
tap
must
try
epic
ale
o
i
know
i
throw
this
word
around
a
lot
but
this
beer
is
so
decadent
as
rich
as
it
is
though
you
can
tell
it
could
still
use
another
two
years
or
so
i
think
5
years
may
be
the
sweet
spot
for
this
beer
would
love
to
have
it
over
some
ice
cream
not
something
you
want
too
early
but

really
excellent
not
quite
as
rich
and
complex
as
the
barrel
aged
versions
but
they
are
also
older
id
like
to
try
this
aged
another
few
years
as
a
more
direct
comparison
to
the
barrel
aged
versions
d
a
little
rough
drinkable
but
only
to
a
certain
point
glad
i
split
this
one
3
overall
this
beer
is
sublime
i
could
happily
drink
this
for
the
rest
of
my
life
overall
this
ale
is
one
of
the
most
curious
and
unique
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
which
makes
it
difficult
to
rate
it
is
nothing
like
a
beer
it
is
more
like
a
port
a
boozy
and
sweet
rare
treat
a
twelve
ounce
serving
is
plenty
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
alone
more
of
a
novelty
beer
share
this
with
another
beer
enthusiast
overall
this
is
very
good
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
from
a
personal
standpoint
i
think
i
prefer
fresh
barelywines
as
i
like
the
alcohol
bite
of
them
also
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
fresh
just
to
see
how
it
changed
over
the
past
five
years
a
nice
treat
but
with
the
sweetness
this
intense
a
little
goes
a
long
way
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
nice
syrupy
medium
brown
almost
like
a
slightly
diluted
molasses
color
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
poured
thick
with
no
head
strong
scents
of
golden
raisins
currants
molasses
brown
sugar
almost
like
a
good
subdued
bourbon
smell
to
it
first
taste
was
almost
like
sipping
on
some
extremely
sweet
golden
raisiin
cough
syrup
but
it
was
mellow
going
down
and
was
pleasant
with
no
veracious
alcohol
taste
which
is
normally
a
good
sign
with
barley
wines
that
they
have
aged
long
enough
couple
more
sips
and
i
got
more
fruit
and
almost
vanilla
flavor
out
of
it
and
an
aftertaste
of
apricots
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
overall
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
it
tasted
really
good
and
cant
wait
to
open
up
some
more
of
other
j
w
lees
barleywines
i
have
sitting
at
home
very
impressed
with
this
the
guy
serving
it
didnt
have
too
many
notes
on
how
it
was
kept
but
i
was
happy
with
the
results
o
a
bit
sweet
overall
but
that
is
an
engilish
bw
for
you
looking
forward
to
this
with
some
more
age
on
it
i
may
also
try
blending
it
a
bit
overall
im
honestly
not
sure
what
to
say
about
this
beer
im
a
fan
of
barleywines
but
this
seemed
more
like
a
strong
sweet
cider
on
the
initial
attack
with
an
unusual
fibrous
rottenapple
yeasty
finish
that
didnt
quite
jive
just
not
for
me
i
guess
great
drink
right
out
of
the
cask
just
wonderful
pretty
good
but
very
sweet
and
rich
a
super
sipper
aged
great
though
overall
i
was
intensely
impressed
by
this
ale
the
first
as
far
as
i
can
recall
ive
ever
had
by
jw
lees
i
would
consider
it
a
fantastic
and
fascinating
exemplar
of
a
barleywine
i
look
forward
to
sampling
other
vintages
pours
a
dark
mahogony
color
with
no
head
and
sticky
spotting
of
lace
there
are
visible
floaties
everywhere
the
aroma
is
big
and
bold
i
can
smell
it
when
i
undo
the
cap
the
aroma
is
of
molasses
and
figs
with
green
and
dark
fruits
present
taste
follows
suit
closely
molasses
and
figs
are
the
dominate
flavors
green
and
dark
fruits
play
out
also
there
is
a
sweet
caramel
backbone
underneath
the
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
lowly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
the
taste
is
well
blended
and
smooth
i
give
two
schlitz
about
the
2008
jw
lees
harvest
ale
overall
it
didnt
impress
me
one
bit
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
up
an
incredible
amount
of
depth
came
up
it
really
gets
quite
a
bit
more
drinkable
at
cellar
temperature
the
alcohol
really
blends
seamlessly
and
the
sweetness
seems
under
control
at
that
point
im
curious
to
try
older
and
newer
versions
of
this
to
see
the
contrast
though
i
expect
it
gets
closer
to
its
prime
with
a
touch
more
age
o
wow
ive
used
this
word
twice
in
a
review
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
sweet
and
decadent
syrup
its
got
to
be
the
top
of
the
style
for
me
if
you
like
ridiculously
syrupy
and
sweet
beers
this
one
is
for
you
this
2009
vintage
barley
wine
was
consumed
at
my
annual
barleywine
and
stilton
party
this
holiday
season
the
beer
has
that
classic
barleywine
look
of
brown
and
garnet
with
just
a
wisp
of
foam
the
aroma
is
a
heavy
dose
of
tobacco
along
with
fig
raisin
and
fermented
fruit
the
palate
is
smooth
the
flavor
continues
along
the
lines
of
the
aroma
with
a
heavy
fig
presence
and
tobacco
the
dark
ripe
fruits
adds
wonderful
complexity
deep
earthiness
mixes
in
making
it
a
very
enjoyable
sipping
brew
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
soapy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
nice
ring
and
haze
sweet
sticky
malt
aromas
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
touch
of
toasted
grain
and
a
whole
lot
of
oak
taste
is
dominated
by
more
big
malty
flavors
of
baked
grains
caramel
oatmeal
candied
orange
peel
and
oak
mouthfeel
is
sticky
yet
smooth
with
a
fairly
full
body
and
low
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
barleywine
theres
a
reason
its
considered
such
a
high
watermark
2009

sweetness
light
molasses
and
brown
sugar
strong
notes
of
dark
dried
fruit
hints
of
cherry
not
quite
full
bodied
carbonation
at
a
minimum
some
chalkiness
to
it
possibly
too
early
in
its
life
to
enjoy
its
subtle
complexities
quite
sweet
still
will
revisit
a
true
vintage
i
had
mine
as
my
night
cap
with
crackers
honey
and
chunks
of
stilton
it
was
sublime
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
bottles
of
08
and
the
10
in
port
casks
that
i
recently
picked
up
pours
an
amberorange
color
zero
head
with
minimal
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
nose
is
alcohol
dark
fruit
and
malt
nice
but
not
outstanding
the
taste
is
dark
fruit
nuts
alcohol
a
step
up
from
the
nose
for
sure
feel
is
medium
and
syrupy
very
much
like
a
port
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
i
would
have
this
again
cheers
overall
this
drinks
so
well
great
flavor
one
of
my
favorites
and
a
highlight
of
this
year
oa
unique
and
special
barley
wine
worthy
of
revisiting
on
special
occasions
i
might
update
my
review
as
i
get
used
to
it
on
a
side
note
i
am
officially
halfway
through
the
ba
top
100
which
currently
is
drastically
different
from
when
i
started
but
still
overall
i
thought
this
was
way
too
sweet
id
like
to
try
an
older
version
to
see
if
things
mellow
out
at
all
overall
i
would
really
enjoy
one
of
these
every
once
in
a
while
it
would
complement
apple
pie
ala
mode
or
bread
pudding
at
the
end
of
a
meal
while
i
thought
thomas
hardys
had
a
bit
more
complexity
i
greatly
enjoyed
and
strongly
recommend
this
one
from
jw
lees
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
out
of
my
price
range
but
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
this
is
an
outstanding
barleywine
that
is
way
too
easy
to
drink
yet
again
i
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
if
you
have
the
chance
to
get
some
of
this
you
should
nb
the
2006
tasted
of
caramel
dirt
some
soy
sauce
and
faint
coffee
grounds
some
of
the
honey
none
of
the
spice
firstly
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
barleywines
that
being
said
i
had
always
wanted
to
try
this
one
based
on
things
ive
read
had
at
monks
in
philly
bartender
had
to
dig
it
out
and
was
dusty
pours
a
warm
almost
purple
color
but
its
dark
in
the
back
of
monks
smell
is
crazy
i
got
figs
plums
brandy
sugars
very
strong
does
not
have
any
head
to
speak
of
taste
is
intense
but
mellow
at
the
same
time
strong
presence
of
fruit
soaked
in
brandy
here
bartender
served
it
warm
and
it
was
perfect
at
room
temperature
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slick
its
a
sipper
this
may
change
my
opinion
on
the
style
overall
great
beer
o
very
good
stuff
but
too
expensive
and
probably
better
with
less
than
10
years
on
it
mouthfeeloverall
medium
bodied
with
low
fine
carbonation
smooth
and
the
amount
of
carbonation
left
in
this
beer
is
excellent
overall
a
beautiful
beer
would
love
to
get
ahold
of
another
bottle
of
this
this
example
seemed
past
its
peak
the
flavor
was
powerful
and
delivered
some
rich
flavor
i
will
have
to
try
a
more
recent
vintage
someday
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
english
barleywines
no
two
bottles
are
alike
even
if
they
are
bottled
in
the
same
year
when
you
can
find
this
one
buy
at
least
two
or
three
bottles
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
sipper
for
sure
really
enjoying
this
one
on
a
sunday
evening
4
0
overall
it
was
an
excellent
beer
id
probably
like
to
try
some
of
the
more
recent
vintages
next
to
see
how
they
compare
a
sipper
for
sure
very
sweet
and
a
lot
of
thickness
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
but
not
one
i
would
focus
on
having
again
on
a
day
when
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
sample
some
really
terrific
beers
this
one
stole
the
show
for
me
a
testament
to
the
benefits
that
optimal
in
this
case
i
would
imagine
flawless
cellaring
can
impart
to
a
beer
my
only
regret
is
that
i
didnt
buy
a
second
bottle
thank
you
for
this
daniel
it
was
spectacular
pours
a
lightly
hazed
garnet
with
a
small
ring
of
fine
bubbles
that
cling
to
the
edges
nose
is
of
rich
malt
peat
toasted
nuts
sweet
candied
cherries
ice
cream
sundae
toppings
awesome
super
sweet
in
the
mouth
candied
fruits
toasted
nuts
doesnt
even
express
as
malt
but
as
sweet
dark
fruits
candied
walnuts
a
lot
of
maraschino
cherries
decadent
portlike
vinous
balance
is
superb
just
marvelous
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
99
vinatge
do
drinkability
is
moderate
to
moderately
high
the
flavors
here
are
bold
huge
and
rich
but
it
suffers
at
times
from
being
overly
sweet
and
malty
its
ironic
because
most
of
the
reason
that
this
beer
has
held
up
so
nicely
up
until
now
has
been
because
of
this
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
over
a
family
dinner
and
when
i
first
bought
it
i
almost
balked
at
the
price
for
such
a
small
bottle
but
after
drinking
it
i
found
myself
thinking
that
the
volume
was
nearly
just
the
right
amount
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
make
of
a
10
year
old
bottle
easily
the
oldest
beer
ive
had
and
while
i
like
the
flavors
oxidationaging
has
likely
added
i
feel
like
the
maltyness
is
missing
still
a
pretty
good
brew
but
not
as
epic
as
i
was
hoping
substantial
mouth
feel
giving
some
meaning
to
that
old
saw
liquid
bread
left
sticky
feeling
on
the
lips
i
think
i
need
to
play
around
with
this
one
to
find
the
right
vintage
this
bottle
was
very
very
rich
at
nine
years
delicious
as
a
desert
but
verging
on
too
sweet
for
me
overall
the
best
of
the
vintage
jw
lees
ive
had
and
something
im
going
to
be
looking
to
get
more
of
price
20
at
the
modern
nyc
drinks
quite
well
and
is
a
pretty
damn
good
barleywine
within
its
own
right
but
it
seems
rough
compared
to
versions
aged
twice
as
long
the
alcohol
still
needs
some
time
to
smooth
out
the
body
needs
to
thin
out
a
bit
and
the
flavor
profile
could
use
some
time
as
well
apparently
5
years
out
isnt
nearly
enough
overall
given
the
choice
id
prefer
the
1999
as
the
extra
year
of
aging
has
definitely
improved
the
flavors
dont
get
me
wrong
the
2000
is
still
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
but
if
given
another
bottle
of
it
id
cellar
it
for
at
least
a
year
or
two
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
have
more
o
easily
the
best
english
barley
wine
that
ive
ever
had
this
thing
drinks
like
an
everlasting
gobstopper
the
depth
of
flavor
is
crazy
leather
fruits
spices
aged
maple
syrups
and
the
list
goes
on
the
craziest
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
i
think
this
thing
has
not
even
come
close
to
peaking
what
i
am
tasting
is
progression
and
by
no
means
completion
this
is
a
beer
to
sit
on
for
years
and
then
open
it
to
witness
its
glory
truly
a
memorable
beer
i
need
to
try
more
aged
barley
wines
o
really
tasty
beer
i
can
see
why
people
age
this
for
long
periods
glad
i
have
some
2010s
to
age
definitely
have
to
try
this
if
you
like
barleywines
a
few
months
back
this
bottle
mysteriously
appeared
on
the
shelf
and
found
its
way
home
with
me
pours
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
minimal
tan
head
that
forms
a
ring
on
the
top
this
smells
great
sherry
and
toffee
mixed
with
some
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
to
keep
it
from
smelling
too
sweet
caramel
and
dark
dried
fruit
with
a
slightly
earthy
aroma
round
out
the
nose
quite
nicely
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
coming
in
first
hints
of
sherry
and
earthiness
hit
before
the
palette
goes
almost
completely
dry
finish
leaves
a
long
lingering
molasses
prune
sweetness
that
is
offset
nicely
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
big
thick
body
with
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
light
level
of
bubbles
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
am
a
sucker
for
an
aged
barleywine
and
this
one
really
impressed
me
this
is
a
beautifully
aged
beer
now
the
regret
sets
in
when
i
realize
that
i
only
bought
one
bottle
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
ever
had
so
full
fruity
and
complex
this
beer
proves
that
english
barley
wines
still
rule
the
world
edit
this
beer
was
so
absolutely
offensive
to
me
that
i
got
off
my
ass
and
did
my
first
official
review
maybe
ill
get
around
to
uploading
my
notes
on
the
other
999
or
so
but
thatll
be
another
day
o
i
have
had
several
vintages
of
this
beer
and
this
one
stands
out
to
me
taste
and
smell
all
made
this
experience
one
i
would
love
to
recreate
o
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
aged
nicely
definitely
a
barleywine
for
anybody
who
loves
the
style
or
wants
to
explore
other
beer
styles
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
pretty
nice
looking
murky
golden
amber
color
the
head
is
nonexistent
no
lacing
here
either
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
wood
on
the
nose
and
plenty
of
boozy
sweetness
to
it
has
a
strong
malty
aroma
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
throughout
the
flavors
of
honey
and
some
spice
the
flavors
are
very
strong
which
makes
this
beer
a
sipper
this
beer
needs
to
be
enjoyed
in
moderation
over
a
long
cold
night
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
has
no
carbonation
overall
its
a
very
good
brew
and
needs
to
be
given
time
in
the
bottle
and
in
the
glass
while
drinking
overall
its
now
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
barleywine
line
up
hard
to
pick
a
winner
between
2005
and
2006
both
are
quality
distinct
and
different
brews
overall
top
rating
because
it
is
so
drinkable
it
is
ridiculous
chuggable
actually
absolutely
no
trace
of
that
11
5
abv
wow
were
it
not
for
the
nasty
price
i
would
gladly
have
a
ton
of
this
much
much
more
enjoyable
than
the
bottled
version
this
drinks
like
something
thats
been
sitting
around
the
dregs
the
leavings
a
fortunate
hodgepodge
very
pleased
its
inspiring
ill
say
again
that
im
super
curious
to
see
what
older
versions
offer
drink
this
was
pretty
good
for
a
9
year
old
bottle
i
am
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
i
am
noticing
that
most
of
these
are
all
very
much
tasting
the
same
but
some
of
the
cask
versions
are
just
a
touch
better
poured
from
a
2000
vintage
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
a
deep
redbrown
color
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
lots
of
big
malts
coming
through
with
a
heavy
dose
of
dark
fruits
sweet
toffee
and
some
prune
and
plum
characteristics
tastes
rich
with
maple
and
oaky
notes
in
the
start
along
with
the
dark
overripe
fruits
very
sweet
from
on
set
to
finish
barely
any
hops
present
tiny
bitterness
in
the
finish
boozy
but
blends
perfectly
like
a
nice
port
very
rich
full
sticky
body
and
almost
no
carbonation
not
my
style
but
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
out
a
complex
beer
indeed
this
is
a
very
malty
and
flavorful
brew
it
starts
with
a
thick
spicy
caramel
blast
there
is
an
odd
earthywood
flavor
at
the
end
good
flavors
and
nice
complexity
i
think
age
has
taken
some
of
the
edge
off
the
alcohol
content
but
its
also
rounded
out
the
flavor
a
bit
too
much
needs
more
bite
o
wonderful
brew
that
is
definitely
meant
to
be
sat
on
for
years
and
years
most
barleywines
would
not
be
be
this
drinkable
after
10
years
this
is
definitely
quality
pours
light
mahogany
with
a
cap
of
offwhite
foam
pretty
good
lacing
aroma
is
toast
and
honey
sherry
with
dark
fruit
like
black
currant
and
fig
smells
good
with
nice
complexity
taste
is
wow
blast
of
sweetness
which
hits
you
up
front
and
then
fades
into
a
nice
long
honey
finish
honey
and
sherry
are
dominant
flavors
full
bodied
a
minimal
carbonation
which
is
fitting
for
the
style
slight
acidity
which
provides
some
nice
structure
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
slow
sipper
for
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
one
of
the
most
complex
and
biggest
beers
ive
had
this
made
me
a
very
popular
pourer
conclusion
sweeter
than
i
expected
from
tasting
other
aged
english
barelywines
i
am
now
curious
to
taste
how
much
less
sweet
it
is
fresh
this
is
now
the
oldest
beer
i
have
tasted
though
not
the
oldest
in
my
cellar
and
it
was
a
true
treat
both
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
both
are
a
bit
murky
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
the
1986
is
darker
slightly
rest
of
the
review
is
for
1999
as
i
liked
it
just
a
touch
better
smells
so
sweet
and
malty
lots
of
dark
fruits
and
a
nice
raisiny
on
the
nose
and
the
tongue
some
subtle
vanilla
and
almost
woody
some
nice
earthy
tones
no
real
hops
to
speak
of
super
smooth
and
a
nice
solid
mouthfeel
thick
boozy
still
very
very
good
overall
a
delight
thanks
to
my
wife
for
the
treat
bottle
opens
with
a
tiny
pffft
indicating
an
undercarbed
barleywine
but
the
pour
shows
otherwise
light
carbonation
but
a
nice
fizzy
head
does
form
before
vanishing
the
aroma
is
somewhat
less
integrated
than
the
two
previous
vintages
even
at
11
years
in
the
bottle
caramel
apple
dates
brown
sugar
and
some
molasses
on
the
palate
the
caramel
sweetness
is
especially
notable
bordering
on
candylike
deep
fruity
notes
complement
brown
sugar
and
molasses
in
the
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
some
sherrynuanced
oxidation
slick
and
oily
but
smooth
and
lush
on
the
palate
the
candylike
sweetness
is
somewhat
tempered
by
the
vanilla
and
fruit
notes
balancing
this
nicely
this
is
my
second
favorite
vintage
overall
behind
the
98
pour
is
a
solid
orange
with
about
a
finger
of
head
this
is
a
head
unlike
anything
ive
ever
seen
i
girth
of
a
bubbles
that
hovers
just
below
the
head
like
an
american
ris
but
longer
settling
after
about
8
seconds
nose
pollen
whiskey
malt
old
furniture
and
subtle
banana
a
palate
of
sweet
honey
in
a
transition
of
floral
to
thisle
bitter
earth
there
is
a
nice
tang
in
the
finish
a
baltic
porter
hint
a
finish
of
pomagrante
earth
bitter
seeds
and
hints
of
lingering
toasted
sesame
a
wonderful
earth
note
in
the
cask
overall
a
little
expensive
for
the
bottle
at
about
7
for
the
9
3
oz
this
beer
has
such
a
high
average
but
feels
subpar
to
me
little
bit
of
a
let
down
however
i
may
buy
another
one
and
let
it
age
longer
to
see
if
it
improves
light
brown
beer
off
white
head
not
overly
sweet
nor
dry
reasonable
head
retention
for
a
barley
wine
smooth
malty
caramel
toffee
notes
alcohol
is
warming
not
burning
i
might
be
able
to
taste
a
bit
of
oak
mild
but
apparent
bitterness
very
slight
yeast
character
it
seems
like
a
very
simple
recipe
nice
grain
flavor
mixed
with
kent
golding
and
an
english
yeast
satisfying
a
b
v
i
caught
a
slight
buzz
off
a
4
oz
sample
wish
i
had
more
nice
experience
this
beer
pour
a
beautiful
ruby
amber
color
that
you
can
see
through
like
the
gem
its
named
for
the
attempt
at
pouring
so
there
may
be
head
was
only
met
with
large
agitation
bubbles
as
this
beer
had
no
intention
of
having
or
retaining
head
the
aromatics
smelled
wonderful
there
were
to
many
aromas
to
name
a
list
of
the
major
ones
would
include
raisin
fig
butterscotch
honey
caramel
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
raspberry
the
caramel
flavor
translated
over
into
the
taste
most
prominently
the
amazing
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
dark
raisin
flavor
is
almost
on
par
with
some
of
the
better
port
wines
ive
had
when
this
beer
hits
the
right
temperature
it
tastes
pretty
darn
good
but
at
a
bit
too
cold
it
was
a
little
off
and
a
bit
too
warm
it
was
a
bit
fumy
overall
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
would
say
that
im
also
rather
fond
of
this
style
i
wish
i
could
see
what
one
with
even
more
than
5
years
on
it
tastes
like
note
ive
had
different
vintages
back
to
99
up
to
08
and
it
changes
quite
drastically
the
08
this
year
was
a
bit
much
for
me
and
wasnt
ready
the
99
was
even
cleaner
than
this
2001
from
my
recollection
but
the
tasting
wasnt
side
by
side
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
definately
a
sipper
d
if
i
had
another
one
in
the
fridge
i
would
be
getting
ready
to
pour
it
into
another
glass
so
it
was
the
right
temp
when
i
moved
onto
it
d
wonderful
beer
worth
checking
out
and
pairing
with
a
nice
cigar
i
see
why
this
is
so
highly
regarded
and
sort
of
ask
myself
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
it
a
worldclass
brew
right
here
folks
if
you
like
malts
at
all
you
need
to
try
this
one
ive
had
one
that
was
only
a
few
years
old
and
didnt
think
it
was
so
great
but
once
you
get
5
years
on
it
its
a
champ
its
sweet
so
dont
expect
anything
else
drink
it
as
a
desert
to
finish
a
meal
or
as
a
night
cap
or
a
celebration
beer
at
a
picnic
with
kids
playing
soccer
around
you
the
bottle
says
ale
but
its
significantly
different
from
any
other
ale
ive
had
overall
im
still
getting
over
a
cold
from
the
previous
week
so
perhaps
my
smelltaste
isnt
fully
back
this
is
a
great
brew
but
ive
enjoyed
prior
tasting
of
the
different
j
w
lees
harvest
series
specifically
the
sherry
and
calvados
casks
more
than
this
one
tonight
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
got
the
2006
bottle
looks
syrupy
thick
sugary
with
specks
in
it
amber
darker
brown
color
smell
is
on
point
like
dark
fruits
taste
is
incredibly
sugary
dark
fruits
light
alcohol
oily
malty
with
nice
hop
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
warming
drinkability
is
very
high
for
the
high
alcohol
level
in
my
top
10
beer
list
d
this
one
is
a
fine
sipper
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
4
d
couldnt
finish
it
the
cpj
d
obviously
the
underlying
taste
of
a
spud
was
offputting
for
me
the
thickness
and
sweetness
definitely
didnt
help
in
order
to
ensure
it
wasnt
a
bad
bottle
i
later
picked
up
2007
and
2009
vintages
from
different
locations
it
seems
that
something
in
this
beer
isnt
sitting
well
on
my
palate
the
taste
was
a
very
slight
letdown
it
was
good
but
my
points
of
reference
are
a
2000
and
2001
that
ive
had
recently
the
sweetness
just
was
just
a
bit
much
there
was
caramel
vanilla
some
leather
a
little
astringency
from
the
alcohol
and
the
dark
fruit
flavors
the
mothfeel
was
thick
and
syrupy
the
liquid
coated
my
mouth
very
much
a
sipper
cheers
notes
had
this
one
immediately
after
a
bottle
of
the
2006
which
by
comparison
tasted
like
an
imperial
rauchbier
it
was
heavy
on
the
peat
smoke
and
even
more
boozy
ive
got
a
1999
in
the
cellar
looking
forward
to
it
after
this
positive
experience
d
definitely
a
sipper
but
only
bc
you
want
to
savor
a
vintage
like
this
as
long
as
possible
it
goes
down
smooth
cheers
terrible
drinkability
after
a
few
ounces
this
was
sadly
a
drain
pour
id
be
interested
to
try
other
vintages
but
this
was
a
turn
off
d
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
english
barley
wines
so
i
hope
this
isnt
what
they
turn
into
when
aged
glad
i
was
able
to
sample
this
one
always
love
the
jw
lees
stuff
d
for
the
abv
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
is
limited
by
the
near
cloying
sweetness
of
this
beer
overall
its
the
sweetness
that
kills
this
brew
it
is
a
great
ale
to
age
and
is
definitely
unique
the
nose
is
its
strong
point
a
shame
the
rest
of
the
beer
doesnt
follow
carbonation
is
nonexistant
but
that
is
to
be
expected
creamy
lingering
flavors
makes
for
a
great
sipper
given
that
the
alcohol
is
rather
well
masked
and
at
5
years
it
is
near
gone
from
the
profile
yet
it
does
still
give
the
great
warmth
you
would
want
in
a
fine
aged
barleywine
d
everything
about
this
beer
seems
to
be
in
place
just
a
fantastic
way
to
spend
a
night
cap
not
sure
there
is
a
whole
lot
more
to
say
other
than
this
is
a
great
beer
to
keep
in
the
cellar
for
cold
nights
like
tonight
20f
windchill
barley
wines
arent
something
i
seek
out
very
often
this
has
given
me
a
better
appreciation
for
them
i
dont
feel
the
need
for
a
second
glass
here
besides
i
just
bought
the
one
bottle
i
would
like
to
revisit
with
a
new
bottle
drink
i
wish
i
has
a
science
fiction
refrigerator
so
i
could
grab
an
8
year
old
j
w
lees
at
will
i
cant
find
any
2003
2004
or
2005
i
guess
ill
have
to
stock
up
on
the
2006
which
seems
to
be
readily
available
and
hope
my
stock
of
the
2002
lasts
till
2014
looks
rather
viscous
while
being
poured
forms
a
sticky
1
head
that
persists
until
the
glass
is
empty
actually
who
knows
how
long
it
would
last
i
drank
the
foam
too
smells
wonderful
a
humungous
malt
bomb
with
luscious
sherry
notes
toast
and
alcohol
too
taste
is
mindblowing
good
waves
of
malt
attack
the
tongue
and
surrender
feels
great
figs
rich
desserts
chocolate
melons
and
a
nice
grainy
note
no
hint
of
hops
left
the
alcohol
provides
as
much
bitter
dryness
as
the
ibus
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
low
carbonation
and
enough
alcohol
to
balance
the
immense
weight
i
could
drink
this
stuff
until
i
collapsed
which
probably
wouldnt
be
that
long
the
ultimate
beer
for
a
cold
evening
d
this
is
a
very
complex
yet
balanced
sipper
not
to
rushed
and
not
to
guzzled
this
beer
really
develops
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
a
truly
fantastic
beer
d
a
fantastic
sipper
would
be
an
ideal
treat
after
a
fancy
dinner
anything
more
than
the
12oz
pour
would
be
too
much
though
very
sippable
beer
but
not
much
more
there
isnt
any
heat
though
from
the
alcohol
which
is
wonderful
nice
beer
well
handled
not
over
the
top
which
would
have
been
such
an
easy
trap
into
which
to
fall
d
the
mouthfeel
made
this
is
a
sipper
and
the
sweetness
really
made
it
difficult
to
drink
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
mind
blowing
especially
on
cask
however
that
did
not
happen
the
sweetness
was
too
much
and
i
ended
up
cutting
the
last
bit
of
my
glass
of
this
with
a
sour
beer
to
make
it
more
palatable
aroma
is
spices
such
as
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
caramel
and
apricots
the
apricot
aroma
is
really
strong
the
more
i
nose
into
this
the
flavors
are
on
the
sweet
fruit
side
with
some
alcohol
showing
lightly
very
smooth
and
full
bodied
and
syrupy
but
its
really
too
much
sweetness
for
me
a
bit
outside
the
balanced
range
a
good
beer
that
someone
with
a
sweet
tooth
would
enjoy
as
it
is
a
decent
beer
well
be
tapping
into
a
99
bottle
and
an
04
in
the
coming
weeks
very
sugary
surapy
mouthfeel
one
of
these
at
a
time
is
great
after
that
would
be
a
bit
much
this
is
a
bloody
amazing
beer
one
which
both
refines
and
expands
the
brewers
art
such
fantastic
flavours
such
a
depth
of
character
and
so
well
balanced
its
an
artisanal
item
something
to
be
cherished
truly
remarkable
and
one
of
the
very
best
beer
experiences
it
has
been
my
pleasure
to
have
overall
this
is
certainly
a
sipper
but
an
incredibly
complex
sipper
so
many
different
fruit
and
sweet
flavors
come
out
as
it
warms
fantastic
beer
notes
remembers
me
of
some
nuances
of
the
99
vintage
that
i
had
bottled
not
too
long
ago
and
compares
very
well
to
the
06
vintage
ive
tried
on
tap
before
all
in
all
the
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
remains
a
classic
work
trying
comparing
and
enjoying
im
a
big
fan
of
old
ales
but
this
one
just
wasnt
fantastic
to
me
enjoyable
and
im
looking
forward
to
the
01
and
assorted
barrel
aged
versions
sleeping
in
my
cellar
but
this
one
wont
be
sought
out
again
particularly
given
the
price
one
of
my
favorites
and
one
of
the
best
i
ever
had
this
ale
was
an
eye
opener
for
me
that
showed
me
the
level
of
complexity
and
deliciousness
a
malt
forward
beer
could
achieve
without
losing
its
balance
2000
vintage
pours
a
cloudy
light
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
aroma
is
a
standout
of
caramel
toffee
and
sweet
grains
the
flavor
does
not
dissapoint
caramel
toffee
molassessherry
some
dark
fruit
and
sweet
grains
all
meld
into
one
terrifically
balanced
barleywine
bitterness
is
not
noticeably
present
but
the
beer
is
not
cloying
and
perfectly
balanced
there
is
some
slight
oxidation
which
probably
improves
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
a
barleywine
and
drinkability
is
impressive
for
a
beer
this
big
this
is
my
favorite
barleywine
to
date
and
a
real
treat
that
i
drank
to
celebrate
the
birth
of
my
first
daughter
d
way
too
easy
dangerous
sinful
and
delish
fullbodied
wmild
carbonation
syrupy
sticky
and
perfect
far
too
easy
to
drink
given
its
serving
size
and
abv
glad
my
brother
shared
this
275ml
bottle
with
me
but
now
i
need
one
of
my
own
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
on
the
sweet
side
from
the
bottle
and
the
cask
version
even
though
its
the
2009
version
and
doesnt
have
much
age
on
it
is
overly
sweet
it
reminds
me
of
the
simpsons
episode
where
the
british
guy
tells
lisa
and
bart
that
our
sweets
are
different
than
those
across
the
pond
and
then
they
proceed
to
go
into
an
lsdlike
trip
after
eating
the
candy
very
sweet
but
if
youre
a
malthead
this
may
be
right
up
your
alley
d
the
prominence
of
the
alcohol
the
viscosity
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
rich
sweetness
create
a
beer
that
is
best
sampled
in
small
doses
even
this
9
3
oz
bottle
might
be
a
bit
much
for
me
but
hey
its
not
meant
to
be
a
session
beer
and
for
what
it
is
it
does
its
job
well
this
is
definitely
a
special
occasion
beer
and
id
probably
be
inclined
to
share
my
next
bottle
but
im
planning
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
while
the
shop
has
em
in
stock
overall
a
wonderful
beer
and
very
unique
the
only
thing
ive
had
that
comes
even
close
to
it
in
character
is
cherry
adam
on
the
wood
overall
crack
it
open
when
you
want
something
rich
and
strong
like
a
cognac
it
almost
kind
of
drinks
like
utopias
except
obviously
not
as
strong
or
nuanced
either
way
let
it
age
before
cracking
it
open
2006

this

just
one
quite
cloying
awesome
if
you
have
1999s
check
in
i
dont
see
how
they
could
possibly
drink
any
better
i
tend
to
be
an
agedbeer
skeptic
but
this
is
pretty
impressive
probably
the
oldest
beer
ive
ever
had
and
im
amazed
how
well
its
holding
up
one
of
those
beers
everybody
should
try
and
i
need
to
thank
masterski
for
my
chance
it
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
first
to
a
ring
and
island
and
then
nothing
at
all
on
the
nose
the
two
predominant
notes
are
a
very
distinct
mint
and
biscuit
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
huge
malt
sweetness
its
not
overpowering
by
any
means
just
huge
at
the
end
there
is
a
note
of
alcohol
not
surprising
given
the
content
here
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
syrupy
and
cloying
pretty
large
the
alcohol
content
and
price
conspire
to
make
this
one
not
something
to
drink
lots
of
but
it
paired
wonderfully
with
a
rare
ribeye
tonight
and
for
that
sort
of
purpose
its
a
great
drink
hop
deterioration
is
evident
older
vintages
are
noticeably
sweeter
2008
is
the
only
one
i
can
smelltaste
hops
in
d
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
rich
caramelized
flavors
and
a
wonderful
boldness
that
hides
the
considerable
amount
of
booze
drinkability
this
is
incredible
probably
the
best
english
barleywine
ive
had
to
date
this
truly
is
the
standard
bearer
of
the
style
so
rich
and
with
such
depth
of
flavor
and
velvety
body
its
hard
to
see
how
people
could
find
error
in
this
beer
while
not
a
beer
for
all
occasions
i
cant
think
of
a
better
afterdinner
beer
an
incredible
pleasure
to
drink
strongly
suggested
notesfinal
thoughtsthis
beer
is
awesome
didnt
expect
to
like
it
so
much
and
im
beginning
to
suspect
i
strongly
prefer
the
english
interpretations
of
barleywines
to
the
hoppy
dipalike
american
ones
ive
been
mostly
exposed
to
drinkability
i
have
a
few
more
vintages
of
this
and
if
they
are
anything
like
this
i
am
in
for
a
treat
i
think
im
going
to
pick
up
some
more
1999
vintages
when
i
see
them
very
very
enjoyable

brandy
english

warm

cherries
and
subtle

the

notes
of
tobacco

nutmeg
damp

alcohol
pepper
and
some
almond
creamy
full

with

d
the
lack

makes
this
beer
want
to
fly
down
your
throat
but
the
weight
can
be
felt
not
tasted
overall
drinkability
is
good
for
a
barleywine
but
it
lets
you
know
that
its
a
sipper
12oz

poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
color
is
opaque
dark

with
a

raisins
and
nearly
no
hops
that
i
can
pick
out
i
know
nate
mentioned
some
of
these
beers
were
vintage
and
this
smells
the
part
completely
flavor
is
mellow
chocolate
malts
and
a
nice
strong
alcohol
taste
very
similar
to
a
blend
of
milk
and
bitter
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
almond
or
im
having
to
resist
inhaling
this
beer
its
great
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
it
has
a
flavor
feel
that
i
tend
to
associate
with
oak
aging
of
some
form
its
amazing
to
say
a
2
year
old
beer
is
still
a
baby
and
this
review
may
be
a
bit
unfair
but
it
is
what
it
is
as
they
say
a
very
english
barely
wine
and
a
true
classic
i
think
there
are
some
more
interesting
examples
2002
vintage
served
in
my
old
stock
snifter
pours
a
semihazy
mahogany
with
a
slick
of
a
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
broken
spots
and
a
thin
bubbly
band
around
the
edges
some
light
spots
and
strands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
is
sweet
maple
syrup
toffee
prunes
figs
and
a
slightly
boozy
quality
on
a
maltybready
backbone
taste
consistent
with
nose
wow
this
is
amazing
sweet
and
fruity
and
the
alcohol
all
but
disappears
dangerous
for
an
11
5
brew
the
distinctive
aromas
in
the
nose
really
coalesce
nicely
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
quality
to
the
texture
what
an
amazing
barelywine
the
price
is
a
little
steep
at
8
00
a
bottle
but
what
an
exceptional
treat
i
will
need
to
pick
up
some
more
of
these
over
time
and
stagger
their
openings
a
superb
example
of
the
style
suitable
for
quiet
contemplation
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
cigar
i
imagine
the
beer
pours
a
rich
murky
brown
a
minimal
toffee
crown
forms
maybe
a
finger
or
so
in
height
before
dissipating
quickly
without
leaving
any
lacing
behind
i
cant
fault
the
beer
too
much
for
that
though
it
is
eleven
years
old
after
all
the
nose
is
great
toffee
and
alcohol
soaked
fruits
and
a
hint
of
wet
cardboard
from
the
inevitable
oxidation
the
flavor
is
an
exact
duplicate
with
a
slight
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
ive
never
had
a
fresh
harvest
ale
but
its
beautiful
with
a
decade
plus
of
age
on
it
the
body
on
this
is
incredibly
rich
and
full
and
the
lessened
carbonation
leads
to
ultimately
a
very
smooth
and
velvety
mouthfeel
a
phenomenal
flavor
and
solid
mouthfeel
make
this
vintage
gem
very
drinkable
im
just
cringing
now
at
the
thought
that
i
only
bought
two
bottles
of
this
magic
elixer
i
think
the
97
was
my
favorite
despite
the
oxidization
or
perhaps
2002
because
of
the
lovely
grainhusk
aromas
the
2004
really
stood
out
as
one
of
the
best
vintages
by
far
the
2000
was
the
oddball
and
didnt
seem
really
to
belong
there
are
huge
variations
in
flavour
and
colour
year
to
year
not
simply
the
minor
nuances
i
was
expecting
i
certainly
recommend
a
tasting
of
this
magnitude
if
you
can
possibly
set
it
up
cheers
d
the
only
possible
complaint
is
that
there
is
too
little
carbonation
which
leads
to
overwhelming
sweetness
but
if
you
expect
this
going
in
its
pure
bliss
the
best
i
can
imagine
in
a
barleywine
a
wonderful
night
cap
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
stocked
away
to
enjoy
over
the
coming
years
i
wondered
if
5
years
was
even
too
young
but
i
think
this
has
been
poured
at
just
the
right
time
lovers
of
exquisite
big
beers
especially
old
ales
and
barleywines
seek
it
out
if
you
havent
already
the
oldest
beer
ive
ever
sampled
and
also
one
of
the
best
fantastic
d
well
the
alcohol
note
definitely
is
not
there
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
and
the
flavors
are
phenomenal
i
would
have
a
hard
time
saying
no
to
a
second
or
third
serving
of
this
an
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
highly
recommended
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
different
vintages
of
this
and
i
am
excited
to
let
them
mature
past
the
11
year
mark
fantastic
i
think
the
lagavulin
2005
benefited
greatly
from
its
time
in
the
oak
some
woody
or
smoky
dryness
would
help
round
out
this
01
vintage
ale
because
on
its
own
it
is
an
intense
ride
with
no
seatbelts
it
is
worth
the
experience
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
but
definitely
share
it
with
a
friend
or
three
1999
vintage
thanks
ken
for
sharing
this
one
at
the
first
ba
gathering
i
attended
poured
from
the
smallish
9
3
ounce
bottle
a
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
little
bone
colored
head
great
aromas
of
caramel
dark
fruit
and
golden
raisins
on
the
palate
more
caramel
light
brown
sugar
and
a
liqueurlike
alcohol
presence
an
excellent
beer
mouthfeel
is
chewy
syrupy
brings
to
mind
the
dfh
120
drinkability
is
solid
i
would
welcome
another
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
my
preferred
styles
but
the
best
ive
had
to
date
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
must
hold
back
to
take
small
sips
of
it
truly
one
of
the
best
barleywines
that
i
have
ever
had
d
maybe
it
was
handled
improperly
not
going
to
fault
it
for
that
the
beer
is
drinking
much
better
as
it
warms
absolutely
fantastic
english
barleywine
for
sure
and
i
will
pick
more
of
this
up
for
sure
d
if
i
had
an
unlimited
supply
id
be
a
happy
man
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
good
but
i
would
like
to
try
a
more
recent
vintage
or
fresh
db
expensive
but
definitely
ages
pretty
well
good
qualities
remain
and
i
can
even
see
it
going
a
bit
longer
but
personally
would
probably
prefer
a
35
year
one
would
love
to
do
a
5
or
6
bottle
vertical
some
day
beer
t
this
one
drinks
slowly
but
after
having
this
first
one
i
can
see
why
there
are
so
many
life
long
fans
of
this
ale
with
many
of
those
drinkers
keeping
it
in
large
numbers
for
years
to
come
to
enjoy
the
journey
that
this
beer
takes
i
return
to
this
one
for
years
to
come
and
not
bat
an
eye
at
the
slightly
intimidating
price
tag
again
buy
it
and
enjoy
then
buy
some
more
and
enjoy
even
more
at
a
later
date
a
treat
my
friend
d
kurtz
brought
over
wow
the
smell
is
a
treat
in
itself
smells
like
england
aroma
is
sweet
and
an
alcohol
bouquet
color
is
a
dark
reddish
brown
no
head
small
foam
ring
around
the
edge
flavor
is
sweet
with
heavy
dark
fruit
malty
notes
strong
alcohol
presence
but
in
a
nice
warming
finish
i
even
noticed
a
touch
of
saltiness
in
the
flavor
this
is
a
very
big
beer
the
only
down
fall
is
it
is
thick
im
not
a
big
barley
wine
fan
but
this
was
an
amazing
beer
1988
vintage
d
with
its
richness
and
alcohol
content
this
is
not
really
a
summer
beer
i
would
be
quite
willing
to
sip
on
some
of
this
after
a
big
wintertime
supper
though
d
the
1999
is
slightly
more
bitter
than
the
more
recent
vintages
that
ive
tried
recently
which
suggests
it
may
be
past
its
prime
the
carbonation
has
also
receded
as
well
however
its
still
very
very
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
near
perfect
blend
of
carbonation
and
a
full
body
though
its
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
like
it
to
be
the
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
abv
and
the
overall
sweetness
this
one
would
probably
be
better
fresh
with
a
little
hoppiness
to
complement
the
sugars
update
time
and
time
again
i
am
blown
away
by
this
beer
97
and
99
are
particularly
good
nice
to
try
my
first
english
barleywine
the
flavor
profile
is
very
similar
to
de
dolle
stille
nacht
however
i
prefer
the
belgian
in
both
taste
and
mouth
feel
d
a
nice
barleywine
but
very
very
sweet
if
you
like
sweet
fruity
barelywines
this
is
for
you
would
like
to
try
another
vintage
of
this
1999
edition
275ml
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
crisp
deep
copper
almost
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
almost
sherrylike
with
some
noticeable
booze
the
taste
is
a
very
sweet
blend
of
ripe
fruits
and
syrupy
caramel
this
has
a
load
of
complexity
that
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
best
belgian
quads
that
ive
had
this
beer
is
certainly
a
sipper
very
sweet
with
a
decent
amount
of
booze
but
not
enough
to
be
overbearing
this
is
certainly
a
great
beer
for
any
special
occasion
thanks
linda
yum
creamy
and
smooth
lots
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
dark
and
overripe
fruits
seems
like
the
booze
has
really
mellowed
by
now
its
not
very
warming
for
11
5
the
sweetness
is
perfect
with
just
a
semi
thick
mouthfeel
surprising
enough
this
big
heavy
barleywine
is
more
drinkable
than
i
figured
it
would
be
and
definitely
more
than
jw
lees
barrel
aged
versions
of
this
beer
a
very
nice
drinker
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
has
a
very
nice
flavor
low
carbonation
rich
full
bodied
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
11
50
i
am
not
sure
if
there
was
a
carbonation
problem
with
this
bottle
or
if
carbonation
this
low
is
the
norm
but
this
still
is
an
excellent
beer
medium
mouthfeelvery
smooth
a
bit
of
a
prickle
from
some
residual
carbonation
happy
that
that
has
lasted
for
so
long
a
very
enjoyable
and
interesting
drink
a
nice
break
from
all
of
the
dipas
ive
been
having
recently
glad
to
try
it
i
might
pick
up
a
slightly
younger
version
of
thisi
feel
like
it
is
just
past
its
peak
my
2nd
jw
lees
harvest
had
a
98
on
its
10th
birthday
and
it
blew
me
away
this
97
follows
that
trend
got
a
99
on
deck
very
very
soon
and
there
will
be
many
more
to
come
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
a
masterful
creation
d
drink
this
slowly
and
appreciate
i
certainly
was
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
fantastic
poured
into
a
goblet
it
appears
a
very
dark
amber
brown
color
with
some
redish
hues
a
finger
of
yellowish
tan
foam
for
a
head
appears
quite
silky
in
appearance
and
receeds
to
just
a
thin
film
across
the
top
of
the
beer
spotty
amounts
of
lace
cling
all
around
the
glass
aroma
of
this
beer
opens
up
big
and
boozy
like
sherry
but
eventually
gives
way
to
notes
of
molasses
brown
sugar
oaklike
woodsyness
and
some
raisins
soaked
in
alcohol
taste
is
an
impressive
display
of
how
a
beer
can
fight
the
ages
for
nearly
12
years
old
this
beer
has
really
held
its
own
a
slight
touch
of
oxidation
is
present
but
adds
to
the
complex
monster
of
malt
characteristics
my
mouth
is
on
sensory
overload
with
this
beer
flavors
of
oak
and
smoke
showcase
the
toasty
side
of
the
malt
profile
whereas
flavors
of
prunes
and
raisins
balance
out
the
sweeter
side
before
the
hops
bring
in
the
bitterness
feel
of
this
beer
boarderlines
being
syrupy
but
still
very
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
the
aftertaste
includes
some
flavors
similar
to
coffee
chocolate
spice
like
cinamon
and
toffee
masterfully
done
this
is
a
musttry
for
anyone
serious
about
barleywine
note
1988
vintage
aged
22
years
i
wish
this
beer
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
id
love
to
set
aside
a
case
or
two
drinkablity
is
just
wow
this
beer
tastes
amazing
and
goes
down
very
easy
and
smooth
i
had
to
slow
down
to
try
to
make
it
last
longer
i
believe
this
is
the
oldest
brew
ive
had
so
far
and
its
just
very
lovely
there
is
no
question
that
id
would
have
this
again
not
sure
this
is
a
good
as
my
favorite
arctic
devil
but
its
certainly
up
their
for
the
style
d
again
the
epitome
of
an
english
barleywine
after
11
years
this
beer
begs
to
be
sipped
and
explored
for
hours
on
end
thourghly
impressive
d
not
a
bad
barleywine
but
reminds
me
more
of
an
old
ale
i
think
it
needs
more
time
to
smooth
out
its
edges
wished
it
had
a
better
carbonation
level
but
it
would
at
least
of
helped
in
how
rich
sweet
it
is
d
incredibly
drinkable
particularly
for
the
high
abv
this
beer
gets
better
and
better
with
age
overall
such
a
tasty
beer
im
going
to
try
and
find
older
vintages
d
not
a
fan
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
has
a
gross
taste
i
really
dont
care
for
not
something
i
want
to
have
again
an
example
of
a
beer
probably
not
worth
aging
past
a
few
years
or
it
needs
to
age
even
longer
worth
the
price
and
im
interested
in
trying
other
vintages
as
well
1999
was
a
good
year
and
this
beer
just
seems
to
preserve
that
just
a
perfect
english
barleywine
endlessly
deep
and
stimulating
the
kind
of
beer
where
no
matter
how
much
i
try
to
get
words
down
to
describe
its
flavor
or
aroma
i
cant
do
it
justice
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
beer
steep
price
tag
at
19
per
bottle
at
blue
smoke
in
nyc
but
there
was
a
level
of
sophistication
achieved
while
savoring
this
beer
drich
and
bold
with
a
boatload
of
flavour
what
is
not
to
like
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
and
this
unfortunately
detracts
from
its
drinkibility
i
love
to
have
one
and
maybe
two
snifters
but
moreno
thank
you
even
though
it
wasnt
barrel
aged
i
thought
it
was
in
sherry
or
something
great
overall
mouthfeel
warm
candied
earthy
notes
to
it
a
warm
delicious
treat
if
you
can
get
it
d
big
powerful
sweet
and
almost
cloying
a
real
sipper
this
is
a
good
ale
but
i
dont
think
it
quite
lives
up
to
its
name
d
an
easy
sipper
for
an
after
dinner
drink
even
at
9
years
old
this
is
still
drinking
very
young
and
i
could
see
it
lasting
another
1030
years
simply
because
of
the
sugar
content
liken
it
to
a
vintage
port
sauternes
tokaji
classic
dessert
wines
the
99
i
had
of
this
a
few
years
back
was
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
that
beer
had
a
little
more
complexity
and
oxidation
character
but
this
01
is
still
a
damn
fine
beverage
drinkability
the
sweetness
of
the
brew
might
effect
the
drinkability
for
some
but
i
think
that
its
a
good
sipping
ale
with
a
lot
of
fairly
complex
flavors
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
one
continues
to
age
beer
is
sweet
with
kind
of
an
odd
earthy
flavor
to
it
im
not
really
feeling
this
beer
caramel
note
with
some
forward
sweetness
and
no
real
bitterness
beer
finishes
slightly
dry
drinkability
not
good
i
dont
think
ill
be
able
to
finish
the
whole
thing
maybe
the
aged
versions
are
better
or
with
another
10
years
on
it
it
will
improve
right
now
not
my
favorite
opinion
this
beer
is
incredible
this
particular
example
i
would
guess
is
in
its
prime
as
the
complexity
is
there
and
any
contribution
from
oxygen
is
helping
i
would
drink
this
beer
regularly
if
able
to
but
it
does
give
one
something
to
strive
for
in
homebrew
man
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
what
a
beer
this
isnt
what
i
was
prepared
for
but
im
so
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
just
fantastic
from
start
to
finish
d
a
small
serving
is
plenty
for
me
if
im
in
the
mood
for
an
english
barleywine
this
is
the
first
beer
that
comes
to
mind
drinkability
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
a
bottle
split
amongst
friends
is
perfect
poured
cloudy
brown
with
ruby
hints
virtually
no
head
great
aromas
of
malty
sweetness
very
little
if
any
hop
aromas
malty
aromas
are
dark
fruits
definite
alcohol
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
very
sweet
with
some
fig
raisin
type
fruity
flavor
as
well
alcohol
doesnt
really
appear
until
the
end
pretty
well
masked
feel
is
smooth
syrupy
and
has
very
little
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
with
great
characteristics
really
enjoyed
the
beer
a
beer
worth
gathering
vintages
cellaring
and
sampling
over
the
years
drinkable
but
it
is
a
night
cap
not
a
beer
that
is
going
to
mix
in
with
a
night
of
others
by
any
stretch
taste
is
not
quite
as
boozy
as
i
thought
its
full
and
sweet
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
really
cant
get
any
hops
here
at
all
sont
seem
to
be
any
off
flavors
but
its
a
bit
cloying
on
the
finish
d
my
overall
impression
is
this
is
a
great
complex
beer
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
in
there
but
it
can
be
hard
to
find
them
underneath
the
cloying
overpowering
caramel
sweetness
i
have
to
sip
this
one
really
slowly
which
is
i
guess
what
was
intended
very
high
quality
stuff
and
this
fresh
bottle
just
screams
that
it
was
meant
to
be
aged
a
long
time
overall
this
is
a
pretty
great
bw
cant
wait
to
buy
some
to
age
for
a
long
time
the
body
still
retains
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
the
finish
is
extremely
smooth
and
warming
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
after
all
these
years
big
toffee
and
caramel
notes
sugary
syrup
finish
sort
of
a
chalky
mouth
on
the
back
end
this
is
almost
too
sweet
for
me
its
definitely
a
slowsipper
not
a
bad
bottle
to
split
among
friends
and
enjoy
by
the
fire
all
in
all
this
one
is
fantastic
think
papier
with
heavier
sweet
sugars
upfront
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
beers
if
youre
look
for
an
awesomely
complex
sweet
brew
you
will
not
be
disappointed
dthis
is
actually
going
down
extremely
easy
and
i
have
to
catch
myself
to
drink
slowly
huge
alc
content
is
hidden
nicely
although
after
about
11
years
you
would
expect
that
tons
of
sweetness
almost
more
than
i
can
handle
but
so
tasty
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
all
night
but
i
do
wish
i
had
another
sweet
and
vinous
on
the
palate
and
was
a
very
good
drink
warming
boozy
feel
great
to
have
in
the
wintertime
enjoyable
to
have
and
sip
after
dinner
d
a
good
sipper
dont
notice
any
alcohol
although
i
feel
it
a
bit
near
the
end
this
bottle
must
have
been
stored
well
because
it
is
aged
to
perfection
great
nightcap
great
beer
experience
great
example
of
how
beer
can
have
the
complexity
and
aging
potential
of
wine
a
real
treat
and
something
i
will
have
to
try
again
both
this
vintage
as
well
as
others
d
im
very
sad
this
is
the
only
bottle
i
have
cant
wait
to
try
some
other
vintages
d
fantastic
drinkability
on
an
11
5
barleywine
no
alcohol
burn
but
the
big
body
makes
this
a
fuller
beer
that
falls
between
a
sipper
and
a
beer
with
average
drinkability
this
could
make
a
classic
pairing
with
so
many
cheeses
and
cigars
this
beer
was
surely
made
with
an
eye
to
aging

the

the
cascading

looks
like

in

like
the

the

was
shocking
being
it

it
warms
you
when
smelled
like

very

silky
one
of
if
not
the
smoothest
mouthfeel
ive
come
across
very
understated
carbonation
almost
like
it
isnt
carbonated
just
enough
bubbles
to
sniff
perfection
the
very
best
of
english
barleywines
conclusion
this
beer
was
challenging
crazy
unique
and
complex
at
a
decade
old
im
not
surprised
to
find
some
signs
of
oxidation
here
but
its
acceptable
for
the
age
and
the
style
and
though
i
didnt
love
this
i
was
seriously
impressed
with
it
and
would
love
to
try
some
more
vintages
of
this
in
the
next
few
years
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
abv
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
to
drink
any
more
then
1
bottle
in
a
sitting
though
its
very
good
though
for
a
9
year
old
beer
and
very
complex
id
love
to
try
other
vintages
d
overall
a
great
brew
that
holds
up
incredibly
well
over
the
years
i
cant
wait
to
crack
open
a
few
other
vintages
a
see
how
the
flavors
progress
a
fine
once
in
awhile
sipper
with
little
allure
to
me
personally
d
surprisingly
high
for
11
prob
the
smoothest
beer
ive
ever
had
incredible
i
would
say
this
is
drinking
pretty
damn
good
9
years
in
ill
have
to
see
if
i
can
pick
up
some
other
vintages
a
wonderful
beer
something
for
those
long
cold
nights
this
is
incredible
truly
one
of
the
best
barleyines
make
that
beers
period
that
i
have
tried
this
is
a
monster
and
can
be
aged
for
even
longer
a
must
try
syrupy
mouth
feel
but
not
sticky
very
drinkable
but
i
now
understand
why
the
bottles
are
so
small
this
is
to
be
enjoyed
like
a
rich
small
portion
treat
i
love
it
but
enough
is
enough
after
a
few
sips
overall
this
is
a
very
good
for
an
english
bwine
very
sweet
but
still
holding
up
well
not
something
i
would
want
a
lot
of
though
id
be
very
interested
in
seeing
how
this
develops
by
having
a
minivertical
i
need
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
hold
of
some
1998s
still
since
i
know
i
can
get
9903
no
problem
d
welcome
to
sweetness
101
and
the
10
year
flavor
voyage
great
beer
price
is
a
turn
off
but
i
am
curious
how
a
newer
vintage
harvest
ale
is
the
2000
was
the
agreed
favorite
between
my
friend
and
i
with
a
slightly
sweeter
bigger
body
the
vintage
was
responsible
however
and
not
the
age
imo
not
much
carbonation
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
greatness
of
this
beer
i
still
dont
believe
how
drinkable
this
is
for
how
strong
it
is
true
ageworthy
world
class
o
my
first
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
was
delicious
would
be
a
great
after
dinner
drink
due
to
its
massive
sweet
maple
flavor
a
nice
calm
caramel
sweetness
surrounds
the
malt
in
the
taste
some
mocha
and
faint
vanilla
as
well
rich
but
not
thick
i
get
a
hint
of
smokiness
on
the
end
with
a
peppering
of
spices
this
is
a
darn
fine
beer
at
10
a
bottle
its
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
over
a
celebration
or
special
occasion
which
is
what
i
did
overall
incredibly
rich
an
complex
and
a
good
substitute
for
a
nice
aged
port
wine
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
heavyhanded
but
9
3
oz
spread
over
an
hour
is
close
to
unbeatable
drinkability
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
almost
but
not
quite
overwhelming
there
are
times
when
its
almost
like
drinking
syrup
the
beer
is
saved
by
its
complexity
and
by
the
earthy
bitter
character
that
hangs
out
in
the
background
at
this
abv
the
beer
is
not
one
to
be
consumed
quickly
and
it
might
be
best
if
23
people
could
share
one
of
these
as
a
digestive
after
a
pleasant
dinner
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
a
year
or
so
does
to
this
one
and
to
taste
the
effects
of
the
beer
being
aged
in
different
barrels
e
g
sherry
calvados
etc
lesson
of
this
all
age
these
for
at
least
10
yrs
my
score
reflects
the
99
with
a
slight
downgrade
on
the
drinkability
for
the
01
my
personal
favourite
was
the
99
i
found
it
was
the
most
balanced
of
the
quintet
and
the
more
prominent
hopping
added
an
extra
layer
of
complexity
ill
grab
a
fresh
one
and
re
score
later
the
finish
is
a
stong
fulll
body
that
coats
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
great
balance
of
sweet
sugars
and
a
drier
bitterness
along
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
was
very
interested
to
find
this
one
and
it
was
a
treat
to
be
able
to
try
it
very
rich
drink
but
i
would
like
to
have
some
of
these
that
are
further
down
the
line
to
compare
drinkability
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
far
too
high
for
me
to
call
it
drinkable
i
suggest
splitting
a
12oz
bottle
amongst
two
people
those
into
port
that
snub
their
noses
at
beerhere
it
is
jw
lees
is
about
to
change
your
mind
this
beer
is
truly
epic
go
try
it
now
the
alcohol
is
so
deceptive
its
ridiculous
ive
been
sitting
on
this
bottle
for
a
while
and
was
worried
it
might
be
headed
downhill
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
one
has
never
been
better
complex
rich
smooth
exceptional
beer
i
expected
some
very
good
things
from
this
beer
not
only
did
this
beer
do
that
it
went
beyond
very
good
and
become
of
the
most
tastiest
thought
provoking
beers
that
have
crossed
my
palate
an
outstanding
example
of
the
barleyewine
style
and
one
that
everyone
should
have
the
opportunity
to
taste
drinkability
is
limited
to
small
sips
im
glad
i
split
this
bottle
because
i
dont
know
if
i
could
finish
the
whole
thing
myself
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
fell
asleep
with
maybe
an
ounce
left
in
my
glass
this
beer
did
a
good
job
of
knocking
me
out
for
a
good
night
sleep
and
i
remember
thinking
it
might
pair
well
with
ice
cream
or
a
strong
dessert
its
kind
of
tough
on
its
own
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
different
vintages
of
this
beer
i
could
see
myself
liking
this
one
a
lot
more
in
the
right
time
and
place
with
added
experience
of
aged
barleywines
2
tastes
of
toasted
malts
upfront
toffee
and
a
little
earthy
chocolate
in
the
middle
and
an
almond
finish
has
a
sweet
wort
flavor
hints
of
maple
syrup
and
toffee
candy
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
but
the
98
vintage
i
had
earlier
this
year
was
just
slightly
better
in
the
taste
so
im
thinking
this
vintage
could
still
develop
more
hardly
any
carbonation
on
the
palate
but
its
perfect
for
this
beer
a
little
syrupy
and
thick
coating
on
the
tongue
great
sipping
beer
for
a
cold
day
pours
a
dark
amber
cloudy
with
little
head
good
for
a
barleywine
smell
is
very
yeasty
and
sweet
very
much
like
apple
cider
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
odd
very
raisiny
as
you
would
expect
to
find
in
an
eisbock
or
such
also
fruity
and
estery
mouth
is
mediumbodied
with
low
to
medium
carb
fairly
straight
forward
with
that
strong
sweetness
having
a
presence
in
the
feel
the
flavor
is
honestly
a
bit
offputting
maybe
the
bottle
i
had
was
a
bit
off
after
its
aging
very
swwet
and
malty
to
an
unbalanced
extent
that
said
its
certainly
not
bad
but
a
bit
syrupy
d
not
the
easiest
to
drink
the
thickness
and
sweetness
weakens
its
character
d
this
is
a
wonderful
experience
eye
opening
and
educational
over
all
this
is
a
good
beer
ranging
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
of
things
i
would
drink
only
one
at
a
session
and
have
it
next
to
last
this
one
is
worth
it
this
is
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
tried
very
liqueurlike
subtle
mellow
and
for
enjoying
slowly
song
harvest
moon
the
brew
is
syroupy
but
not
cloying
and
surprisingly
refreshing
on
the
palate
the
aftertaste
of
alcohol
is
there
but
not
penetrant
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
for
such
a
strong
brew
poured
this
dark
muddy
brown
beer
into
a
pint
glass
little
to
no
head
came
when
poured
faint
wisps
of
lacing
remain
on
the
top
as
it
sits
awaiting
to
be
drank
the
aroma
of
ripe
fruit
greet
the
nose
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
that
of
light
molasses
fruit
and
slight
caramel
aftertaste
overall
a
great
beer
d
definitely
a
sipper
but
one
i
was
very
glad
to
enjoy
this
brew
is
incredible
in
its
complexityand
a
great
sippable
brew
with
absolutely
no
hint
of
11
5
alcohol
in
it
at
all
defiantly
a
fine
experience
that
i
will
do
again
d
well
this
was
definitely
unique
never
had
a
brew
quite
like
this
before
while
this
wasnt
really
my
stle
too
sweet
thick
and
boozey
and
im
pretty
sure
i
wont
venture
for
anymore
i
was
glad
for
the
chance
to
try
it
the
huge
flavors
sweetness
and
booze
content
of
the
brew
make
this
a
slow
sipper
i
probably
shouldve
tried
to
have
this
for
dessert
versus
with
dinner
an
intersting
brew
to
be
sure
and
one
all
fans
of
beerdom
should
try
d
drinkability
a
little
above
average
i
really
would
like
to
come
back
to
this
beer
later
when
my
barleywine
palate
is
more
developed
all
in
all
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
looks
beautiful
the
aroma
is
complex
and
pleasing
and
the
flavor
is
delicious
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
for
special
occasions
and
hunting
down
the
other
vintages
j
w
lees
1999
vintage
harvest
ale
is
truly
a
great
english
barleywine
i
must
try
more
years
of
these
d
probably
the
biggest
aromas
and
flavours
i
have
experienced
in
a
barleywine
it
is
incredibly
sweet
it
makes
your
teeth
ache
just
at
the
thought
of
it
maybe
this
will
lessen
with
cellaring
cant
wait
to
taste
it
again
in
a
few
years
after
it
has
had
chance
to
mature
amazing
tasting
beer
and
definite
must
try
for
everyone
who
drinks
overall
my
opinion
is
that
this
is
one
way
to
sugary
beerkind
of
reminds
me
of
dfh
120minexcept
more
drinkable
i
would
never
seek
out
this
beer
again
but
its
tolerable
d
notsure
how
well
this
one
was
cared
for
the
flavor
and
smell
was
pretty
solid
but
the
other
factors
were
not
impressive
if
you
find
this
on
the
shelves
youd
be
wise
to
pick
one
up
this
is
one
tasty
beverage
all
in
all
i
am
well
satisfied
with
this
beer
needless
to
say
i
am
infinitely
impressed
if
this
wasnt
so
damned
expensive
i
would
do
verticals
of
this
every
single
night
couldnt
have
asked
for
a
better
brew
to
do
my
200th
review
on
i
recommend
this
beer
highly
and
predict
that
it
will
soon
rapidly
climb
to
at
least
the
top
20
of
the
best
of
ba
so
if
youre
looking
for
a
delicious
beer
to
meet
your
every
expectation
look
no

is
same
as
the
2007
except
a
billowy
white
head
resembling
an
ipa
is
constant
throughout
aroma
has
a
lot
more
sweetness
to
it
like
bourbonsoaked

dipped
in
brown

this
version
has
less
bitterness
at
the
end
as
the
sweetness
is
front
center
and
all
other
directions
a
sipper
to
be
sure
but
the
cloying
sweetness
makes
this
a
little
too
big
i
have
a
2001
stashed
away
and
am
hoping
this
brew
gets
better
over
time
the
beer
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
low
carbonation
admittedly
i
am
new
to
lovely
barleywines
and
old
ales
and
i
credit
a
few
beer
with
really
getting
me
into
the
style
such
as
thomas
hardy
2002
kuhnhenn
4th
dementia
and
kuhnhenn
bourban
barrel
barleywine
but
this
one
exceeds
those
beers
on
the
levels
of
mouthfeel
and
smell
for
me
not
as
balanced
and
drinkable
as
some
of
the
others
that
ive
had
but
i
could
definetely
sip
and
enjoy
this
one
all
day
on
a
cold
winters
day
or
a
rainy
fall
day
absolute
heaven
in
a
bottle
i
wanna
swim
in
it
d
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
nicely
aged
barleywine
goes
down
smooth
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
although
it
is
more
like
a
liquor
than
beer
in
a
lot
of
ways
i
would
recommend
cellaring
this
for
a
few
years
to
bring
out
the
varied
qualities
overall
4
7
a
very
drinkable
despite
its
11
5abv
it
is
warming
but
not
overpowering
an
excellent
dessert
beer
would
be
wonderful
on
a
cool
night
it
has
an
opaque
goldenorangecopper
color
with
a
thick
white
soapy
head
there
is
a
portlike
aroma
that
is
very
sweet
and
slightly
alcoholic
the
taste
is
mostly
of
port
but
also
some
malt
it
has
a
thick
fullbodied
mouthfeel
that
i
rather
enjoyed
the
alcohol
lingers
in
your
mouth
after
you
swallow
letting
you
know
this
is
complex
finely
crafted
beer
that
demands
your
respect
i
know
it
is
strong
and
expensive
but
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
after
great
beer
port
is
my
next
favorite
beverage
of
choice
and
this
harvest
ale
combined
them
in
a
way
that
i
love
this
beer
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
d
a
hefty
albeit
sweet
barleywine
i
would
have
liked
more
of
a
hop
component
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
sipping
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
im
glad
i
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
it
it
is
ridiculously
sweet
though
be
prepared
for
a
sipper
it
gets
better
the
closer
it
gets
to
room
temperature
too
after
reviewing
the
rest
of
the
glass
paired
perfectly
with
neals
yard
stichelton
unsurprisingly
dthis
is
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
i
have
also
had
a
2007
vintage
which
was
an
unbearably
sweet
drain
pour
overall
this
beer
is
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
like
the
style
but
something
isnt
working
here
d
a
big
delicious
ballsy
ale
made
even
more
interesting
by
its
time
in
the
cask
truly
a
sipper
and
the
very
definition
of
worldclass
d
hmmm
yes
it
is
for
an
11
5
alcvol
drink
it
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
it
would
be
too
sweet
to
drink
for
the
whole
day
but
it
is
quite
good
d
a
textbook
example
of
how
aging
improves
beers
9
years
seems
to
have
done
a
lot
for
this
bad
boy
ive
tried
fresh
vintages
theyre
a
little
too
sweet
and
boozy
when
young
but
they
really
pull
together
as
they
age
great
stuff
i
will
definitely
buy
more
but
only
older
ones
i
followed
this
with
a
bottle
of
the
2006
vintage
but
that
had
unfortunately
been
oxidized
it
poured
a
very
dark
mahogany
the
smell
wasnt
bad
but
the
taste
was
dominated
by
rusty
metallic
and
moldy
flavors
very
sad
im
not
sure
if
all
the
vintages
are
this
sweet
ive
heard
the
2000
is
less
so
but
it
was
time
to
drink
the
98
i
dont
think
it
could
have
gained
much
more
by
sitting
longer
excellent
marked
2004
decanted
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
quite
dark
amber
color
with
zero
head
as
expected
smells
of
huge
malts
cherries
toffee
and
alcohol
ive
had
very
few
barleywines
so
this
aroma
is
quite
unique
and
interesting
the
taste
is
sweet
with
raisins
cherries
toffee
and
booze
all
making
an
appearance
this
is
so
sweet
i
should
have
definitely
waited
to
try
it
later
in
the
day
like
after
dinner
as
opposed
to
2
pm
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
drinkability
is
extremely
low
as
it
would
take
me
forever
to
even
finish
one
of
these
im
conflicted
with
this
beer
its
obviously
an
excellent
beer
but
its
so
far
out
of
any
style
i
enjoy
that
its
hard
for
me
to
get
too
into
it
d
improves
more
and
more
by
the
sip
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
brew
i
have
a
1999
bottle
thats
cellaring
right
now
but
i
think
ill
wait
for
a
while
before
i
crack
that
open
i
probably
wont
be
getting
another
of
these
i
had
to
suffer
it
down
because
i
dont
believe
in
pouring
i
would
not
recommend
2002
vintage
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
some
yeast
floaters
small
white
head
that
settled
quickly
into
a
ring
the
aroma
is
meaty
marinated
in
soy
sauce
and
raisins
quite
strong
the
taste
is
of
candied
cherries
and
honey
which
slowly
transforms
into
a
savory
marinade
a
bit
salty
and
peppery
and
sort
of
like
teriyaki
sauce
brown
sugar
is
present
and
a
brown
bread
malt
the
brew
has
a
full
body
a
bit
thick
and
almost
syrupy
the
carbonation
is
still
kicking
after
7
years
very
sweet
and
then
savory
i
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
candied
marinated
steak
definitely
has
bold
flavors
but
not
sure
this
is
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
definitely
some
floaters
in
this
one
let
sit
still
for
a
while
before
pouring
almost
no
carbonation
in
this
whatsoever
tried
pouring
from
about
3
feet
above
glass
and
nothing
a
murky
brown
cloudy
beverage
the
smell
is
really
good
picking
up
rum
soaked
plums
dates
and
figs
pretty
boozy
and
heavy
the
taste
is
super
sweet
with
a
slight
bitter
mustiness
at
the
tail
end
reminds
me
of
my
grandparents
basement
this
has
been
the
same
for
all
jw
has
that
ive
had
kind
of
disappointing
the
mouth
feel
is
on
the
more
viscous
side
and
would
improve
greatly
if
there
were
any
carbonation
in
it
given
the
high
abv
the
super
sweet
flavor
and
mustiness
i
could
not
drink
any
more
than
one
bottle
max
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
something
that
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
creamy
silky
mouth
very
smooth
barely
carbonated
nice
easy
drinker
pours
a
cloudy
brown
12
inch
head
of
a
light
tan
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
strong
malt
some
roasted
malt
and
some
bread
aromas
fits
the
style
of
an
english
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
thick
low
to
average
carbonation
levels
present
tastes
strongly
of
alcohol
sweetness
then
some
roasted
malt
comes
through
then
the
bread
flavors
dominate
and
the
finish
is
mostly
the
sweetness
hop
bitterness
is
present
but
does
not
come
through
very
strongly
overall
complex
and
rich
palate
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
i
bought
2
of
these
in
2003
drank
one
in
2006
thought
it
was
good
but
too
sweet
saved
this
one
still
too
sweet
and
starting
to
oxidize
as
well
seems
like
laying
this
down
for
23
years
is
about
right
d
the
only
way
i
can
drink
this
is
in
very
small
sips
over
a
lot
of
time
everytime
i
have
a
jw
i
have
no
desire
for
anything
else
be
it
beer
or
water
or
whatever
in
other
words
i
am
spent
after
the
10oz
or
so
and
ready
for
bed
this
is
the
best
night
cap
beer
ever
in
my
eyes
i
can
see
how
the
sweetness
of
this
could
be
off
putting
for
others
and
it
is
slighty
for
me
after
time
i
still
love
this
stuff
though
and
want
to
try
a
20
year
old
bottle
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
flavor
opens
very
very
sweet
the
hops
are
completely
gone
and
thus
theres
little
to
temper
the
malt
sweetness
aside
from
light
vinous
sourness
in
the
finish
very
fruity
with
a
pronounced
raisin
and
plum
character
nutty
caramelized
chocolatey
malt
very
light
carbonation
barely
present
with
a
thick
syrupy
body
less
earthy
than
the
1996
bottling
and
more
fruity
the
flavors
are
better
integrated
coming
together
in
a
seamless
package
very
nice
pours
a
nice
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
but
not
too
persistent
pale
tan
head
aroma
is
crisp
and
fruity
mainly
of
sweet
apple
more
like
a
cider
than
a
beer
strong
alcohol
bite
overwhelms
the
rather
sweet
fruity
flavor
so
it
is
rather
like
drinking
brandy
mixed
with
fruit
juice
flavor
does
have
a
hint
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
but
is
somehow
not
really
beerlike
nevertheless
it
is
acceptable
if
not
my
cup
of
tea
er
ale
texture
is
syrupy
smooth
and
thick
yet
edgy
thanks
to
the
strong
bite
of
alcohol
it
leaves
a
rather
sweet
aftertaste
coupled
with
some
alcohol
and
hop
bitterness
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
was
amazed
and
ecstatic
to
be
able
to
try
this
vintage
brew
on
tap
at
one
of
my
favorite
bars
i
had
the
chance
to
drink
a
1988
harvest
ale
not
too
long
ago
and
just
had
to
write
that
it
was
the
most
amazing
thing
i
have
ever
tasted
22
years
on
it
and
it
was
sublime
it
was
the
same
flavor
character
as
previously
described
but
everything
was
just
working
perfectly
together
perfection
indeed
drinakbility
oh
how
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
in
my
cellar
this
beer
has
held
up
magnificently
well
developing
a
complex
flavor
profile
while
retaining
the
carbonation
and
bite
of
a
young
brew
i
liked
it
a
little
to
much
sweetness
but
a
very
good
beer
a
very
nice
british
barleywine
quote
from
dad
good
after
dinner
not
a
breakfast
beer
the
beer
poured
an
opaque
medium
brown
with
ruby
highlights
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
very
vinous
much
like
a
red
wine
the
taste
was
a
combination
of
medicinal
vanilla
and
wine
with
the
vanilla
winning
out
the
feel
was
heavy
creamy
and
wet
a
very
enjoyable
brew
i
cant
wait
to
get
some
more
overall
thank
you
brentk56
for
so
generously
sending
me
this
beer
it
was
great
i
wish
i
had
about
a
case
more
the
beer
could
probably
age
for
a
lot
longer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
for
11
5
but
the
intensity
of
the
malt
flavors
makes
it
a
slow
sipper
tonnes
of
nuance
shows
with
warmth
with
new
flavors
emerging
all
the
time
very
nice
d
very
drinkable
and
smooth
drink
like
refined
liquor
but
with
a
beer
taste
tasted
side
by
side
with
the
08
in
2013
lighter
orange
color
looks
like
mead
almost
a
bit
more
sharpness
from
the
abv
but
overall
the
flavor
seems
better
than
the
08
with
only
trace
amounts
of
oxidation
slight
fruitiness
from
the

i
look
forward
to
trying
another
one
a
year
from
now
a
darn
good
beer
but
i
was
just
not
able
to
appreciate
it
the
way
many
raters
have
though
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
to
begin
with
d
dangerously
drinkable
and
a
wonderful
nightcap
this
beer
has
really
held
up
well
over
the
years
did
a
sidebyside
with
a
2004
old
stock
at
thanksgiving
dinner
and
this
one
came
out
on
top
great
beer
for
fancy
dinners
and
special
occasions
very
good
overall
happy
to
say
d
definitely
a
beer
that
lasted
a
long
time
once
of
these
in
an
evening
would
be
great
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
that
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
think
that
9
years
did
wonders
for
this
one
check
it
out
if
given
the
chance
drinkability
i
have
a
11
year
vertical
going
of
this
and
i
will
be
really
happy
the
day
i
decide
to
have
them
excellent
beer
i
am
very
much
considering
purchasing
several
more
bottles
of
this
to
age
even
longer
i
wonder
what
this
will
taste
like
in
2018

a

skip
the

and
head
straight
for
a
bottle
of
harvest
ale
instead
d
this
brew
is
damned
good
so
subtle
and
creamy
lots
of
caramel
makes
this
just
fantastic
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
glad
that
frank
suggested
it
will
definitely
get
this

this

wow
18
years
old
and
darn
tasty
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
world
classic
and
great
example
of
the
style
a
quintessential
cellar
brew
even
at
only
2
years
old
its
drinking
pretty
nicely
overall
its
intense
but
smooth
and
while
it
is
made
for
contemplative
sipping
when
my
enthusiasm
results
in
to
large
a
sip
it
still
goes
down
easily
pours
a
soft
caramel
color
with
a
slight
amount
of
haziness
avoided
pouring
in
the
sediment
the
head
is
not
really
all
there
it
resembles
an
iced
tea
however
with
some
agitation
a
fine
film
can
be
produced
there
doesnt
appear
to
be
much
carbonation
i
understand
that
most
of
these
observations
could
be
due
in
large
part
to
being
aged
for
five
years
the
nose
is
very
strong
and
can
be
picked
up
from
a
few
feet
away
smells
of
candiedcarameled
dried
fruit
figs
apricots
prunes
some
alcohol
is
detectable
in
the
nose
as
well
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
viscous
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
except
that
there
is
a
brief
and
subtle
amount
of
earthy
hops
in
the
begining
and
near
the
end
the
finish
is
nice
not
too
long
and
not
too

only
problem
with

is

its
a
good

i
ate
some
oregonzola

preferred
the

with
a

less
sweetness
this
would
have
been
awesome

still

with
a

head
capping
it
off
it
falls
to
a

and
looks
pretty
nice
bad
thing
is
i
smelled
it
when
i
popped
the
cap
not
so
impressive
big
time
booze
immediately
after
its
poured
there
is
a
dominant
sweetness
along
with
the
booze
something
reminds
me
of
vinegar
in
there
very
subtle
underneath
the
sweetness
well
the
smell
was
pretty
strong
not
really
in
the
best
of
ways
the
sweetness
continues
in
the
flavor
my
reaction
would
have
been
classic
if
i
was
on
video
just
a
bit
of
a
cringe
comes
from
the
flavor
here
maple
syrupy
and
and
fruity
sweetness
big
toffee
and
caramel
all
soaked
in
booze
mouthfeel
is
full
thick
and
chewy
it
is
strongly
hurt
by
the
cloying
sweetness
of
the
beer
however
if
not
for
that
it
would
be
sublime
no
way
i
can
drink
this
beer
im
giving
it
sip
after
sip
minute
after
minute
tried
to
take
a
big
sip
and
it
caused
my
reaction
from
above
not
one
im
planning
on
returning
to
overall
a
great
beer
but
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
hopefully
the
laguluvin
aged
one
will
have
a
little
more
bite
to
match
that
candy
flavor
this
ten
year
old
vintage
is
my
only
taste
of
the
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
to
date
im
still
not
entirely
sure
what
to
make
of
it
it
is
definitely
something
special
and
considerably
unique
it
isnt
like
other
barleywines
it
is
a
beer
of
its
own
one
that
i
cant
define
yet
luckily
i
have
a
number
of
other
vintages
still
waiting
in
the
cellar
to
better
become
acquainted
with

youre
likely
to
find
whether
you
attribute
that
to
age
to
conditioning
to
the
overwhelming
sweetness
of
this
beer
either
way
its
incredibly
drinkable
its
complex
inviting
enjoyable
devilishly
tasty
i
might
just
have
to
recommend
trying
it
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
i
bought
this
bottle
at
partipak
discount
liquors
in
indianapolis
probably
greenwood
regardless
of
the
abv
this
is
immensely
drinkable
i
cant
stop
smelling
it
which
leads
to
another
sip
with
each
smell
the
complexity
of
this
beer
is
truly
a
rare
treat
had
on
cask
at
ebenezers
4th
annual
belgium
beer
fest
should
be
noted
i
beleive
chris
said
the
beer
was
from
98
and
the
cask
was
about
150
years
old
holy
sht
6
oz
pour
into
a
snifter
pours
a
dark
brown
with
little
to
no
head
smell
is
bordering
on
obscene
bartenders
did
not
even
want
to
pour
it
high
alcohol
gasoline
oak
and
bourbon
on
the
nose
who
knows
what
else
taste
was
strong
as
hell
lots
of
whiskey
or
bourbon
some
oak
some
smoke
and
a
whole
lot
of
alcohol
unlike
anything
i
have
tried
before
definitely
a
sipper
oily
mouthfeel
and
super
filling
would
drink
more
but
might
pass
out
notes
my
first
true
english
barleywine
for
what
its
worth
ill
definitely
buy
another
bottle
or
two
for
the
cellar
i
can
see
this
only
getting
better
and
im
curious
to
try
the
barrelaged
versions
2006
vintage
pours
out
a
brownamber
color
with
no
head
at
all
aroma
is
very
nice
roasted
malts
tree
bark
plums
molasses
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
sugary
with
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
particularly
raisins
with
some
roasted
malt
silky
smooth
the
most
amazing
part
about
this
beer
is
that
the
11
5
is
hardly
noticed
if
any
alcohol
shows
at
all
it
is
a
little
in
the
finish
way
better
than
the
thomas
hardy
2005
i
sampled
recently
this
really
is
impressive
although
the
quality
and
time
invested
is
evident
the
high
abv
and
insane
amount
of
sweetness
make
this
a
once
in
a
year
brew
for
me
personally
even
with
the
small
9
4
i
believe
i
could
only
really
see
splitting
with
someone
else
if
i
ever
happened
across
another
maybe
a
different
year
would
have
a
little
less
sweetness
time
will
tell
fantastic
sipping
beer
but
share
with
a
friend
as
it
will
overwhelm
your
palate
after
a
quarter
of
a
bottle
pair
with
a
strong
caramel
dessert
or
vanilla
ice
cream
wow
this
beer
has
a
unique
flavor
profile
there
is
quite
a
bit
going
on
and
it
is
hard
to
place
my
finger
tongue
more
precisely
on
each
taste
it
begins
with
sweet
raisens
rum
and
plum
then
some
spice
clove
and
perhaps
a
little
cinnamon
and
then
a
minor
pop
of
hops
and
finishes
a
little
smokey
each
sip
gives
me
a
different
iteration
of
the
same
story
sticky
on
the
tongue
and
very
low
carbonation
overall
a
great
agedbeer
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavor
is
great
but
the
high
alcohol
will
get
to
you
not
to
mention
it
is
a
bit
cloying
really
a
phenomenal
brew
any
way
you
look
at
it
though
a
very
neat
beer
drinking
experience
m
very
thick
full
bodied
light
carbonation
left
definitely
one
to
be
slipped
slowly
drinkability
hampered
a
bit
due
to
sweetness
and
thickness
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
than
they
put
in
the
small
bottle
this
was
quite
the
experience
though
i
wont
be
buying
another
one
soon
due
to
the
price
almost
a
dollar
an
ounce
but
certainly
a
very
nice
english
barleywine

a

some
leather
tannins
coming
through
as
well
this
is
over
seven
years
old
and
has
aged
gracefully
have
some
more
left
so
ill
check
back
with
those
at
a
later
point
hv
a
bit
young
yet
but
some
things
about
this
06er
are
to
be
greatly
admired

the

not
surprisingly
is
also

does

from
the

very
very

along

me

get
past
the

hops
are
barely
there
some
herbal

are
the
only
sign
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
oily
and
warm
with
alcohol
although
the
alcohol
is
present
it
is
surprisingly
well
hidden
especially
for
this
vintage
and
abv
finish
is
oily

laden
with

it

offering
nonetheless
1997
vintage
poured
a
very
thick
and
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
that
fell
quickly
and
left
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
strong
lots
of
molasses
grapes
alcohol
and
possibly
a
winelike
thing
going
on
smells
like
it
will
taste
slick
the
actual
flavor
is
so
far
from
this
the
flavor
is
wonderful
lots
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
some
slight
roasted
malts
and
raisins
absolutely
wonderful
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
on
the
thick
end
of
moderate
drinkability
is
very
good
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
one
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
14
beige
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
orangey
amber
brew
head
quickly
fades
to
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
and
lacing
is
minimal
both
more
or
less
as
expected
for
the
style
and
age
aroma
is
strongly
of
malt
sweetness
and
alcohol
taste
is
hearty
in
body
yet
slithers
lightly
over
the
tongue
and
down
the
hatch
almost
seeming
to
evaporate
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
alcohol
intergrates
well
is
obviously
present
yet
not
leaving
a
rubbing
alcohol
aftertaste
or
numbness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
superb
so
silky
smooth
and
goes
down
so
well
so
such
a
big
brew
what
an
experience
a
bit
steep
at
over
6
a
bottle
but
certainly
well
worth
it
i
will
need
to
pick
up
the
02
i
saw
on
the
shelves
after
warming
for
20
to
30
thirty
minutes
the
big
roasty
malt
taste
is
paramount
with
smoky
woodsy
undertones
a
very
big
beer
excellent
for
the
style
smooth
rich
and
full
mouthfeel
the
taste
has
so
many
different
characteristics
maple
syrup
molasses
burgundy
brown
sugar
sherryish
and
meaty
the
hops
have
diminished
to
a
subtle
bitterness
that
works
well
for
the
ale
but
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
on
its
own
that
may
seem
like
a
redundant
list
but
it
isnt
just
like
molasses
or
just
like
brown
sugar
its
a
complex
maltiness
and
saying
that
it
is
like
burgundy
and
sherry
is
no
small
claim
for
an
ale
either
but
try
this
one
and
youll
see
its
wonderful
1999
bottle
pours
dark
brown
again
similar
flavors
to
the
1998
but
less
woody
and
more
malty
rich
caramel
malts
dominate
and
a
burnt
sugar
flavor
comes
in
also
a
banana
and
brandy
sweetness
the
roasty
aftertaste
is
much
the
same
as
the
1998
this
1999
bottle
seems
to
hide
the
alcohol
better
than
the
1998
it
is
so
nice
to
find
a
1999
bottle
of
this
great
beer
at
archers
ale
house
in
bellingham
the
bottle
opened
to
produce
a
tawny
brown
that
looks
like
heaven
in
a
glass
nose
was
malts
old
fruit
and
remnants
of
hops
the
taste
was
sublime
very
big
yet
smooth
as
silk
not
as
complex
as
thomas
hardy
but
the
sum
of
the
parts
make
this
a
world
class
beer
a
great
reminder
why
i
love
beer
i
let
this
sit
out
for
few
hours
to
warm
up
a
lot
of
sediment
through
the
deep
woodsy
brown
and
reddish
tinged
brew
bit
unclear
faint
small
bubbles
rising
up
to
a
ring
and
dusting
of
faint
warm
khaki
aroma
of
deep
dark
cherry
and
port
heavy
and
almost
syrup
sweet
karo
almost
molasses
more
than
a
bit
cloying
tight
carbonation
just
a
bit
foamy
medium
body
thick
dark
caramel
sweetness
the
overwhelming
sweetness
is
in
the
flavor
along
with
hoppiness
burnt
toast
port
wine
and
honey
a
lot
of
very
intense
flavors
definitely
a
sipper
an
amazing
beer
for
sure
as
for
pairing
ive
tried
it
with
stilton
as
some
have
suggested
and
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
personally
too
many
strong
flavors
competing
there
i
say
enjoy
this
one
all
by
itself
pours
a
orange
copper
color
that
is
brilliantly
clear
and
topped
by
a
thin
pale
tan
head
the
aroma
is
richly
malty
with
notes
of
sugar
toffee
alcohol
and
already
a
bit
of
oxidation
notes
that
add
a
richness
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
candied
toffeelike
concentrated
maltiness
this
beer
is
fairly
simplistic
with
a
hint
of
hoppiness
that
rounds
out
this
beer
a
bit
despite
its
simple
nature
this
beer
is
still
enjoyable

this

understated

i
want

this
is
what
a

experience
should
be
i
think
this
might
be
better
to
me
about
2
years
younger
if
there
were
more
hop
precense
in
the
body
and
more
individualized
malt
flavors
but
ive
never
had
this
fresh
so
im
not
sure
what
im
comparing
it
to
anyways
just
a
kick

i
would
buy

unusual
overwhelming
and
lovely

raisins

dried
figs
hints

barnyard
very
sweet
like
drinking
a
sweet
sherry
with
carbonation
warming
mouthfeel
as
expected
from
an
11
5
beer
its
definitely
not
a
beer
id
drink
every
day
but
it
sure
was
an
interesting
experience
the
sweetness
makes
this
an
alternative
to
sherry
or
port
rather
than
another
beer
275
ml
is
definitely
enough
for
one
sitting
i
understand
that
some
people
find
it
cloying
but
with
a
beer
this
rich
in
aroma
and
flavour
i
accept
the
sweetness
2001
vintage
enjoyed
straight
from
the
cellar
at
55f
a
very
deep
copperbrown
body
with
amber
highlights
rests
gently
beneath
an
average
sized
head
of
creamy
offwhite
froth
the
head
retention
is
limited
but
at
11
5
thats
to
be
expected
and
it
still
keeps
a
decent
collar
which
is
unusual
for
such
a
high
alcohol
beer
the
nose
is
loaded
with
sweet
caramelized
malt
and
notes
of
stickysweet
dried
dark
fruit
as
well
as
some
leafy
and
almost
herbal
hops
in
the
mouth
its
full
bodied
to
the
point
of
being
syrupy
smooth
and
quite
creamy
the
massive
flavor
assault
that
j
w
lees
delivers
is
quite
astounding
its
beyond
wortlike
in
its
rich
maltiness
dripping
with
sticky
sweetness
thats
like
a
combination
of
honey
and
port
wine
the
kent
goldings
come
through
however
and
help
to
dry
it
with
their
leafy
and
grassy
character
the
bitterness
is
noticeably
limited
but
its
there
and
theres
a
minerallike
edge
to
it
as
well
that
helps
keep
its
toffeecaramelmolasses
and

maltiness
incheck
this
is

exceptional

not

be
missed
im

drinkability
0
5
points
this
one
really
does
live
up
to
the
hype
im
really
curious
to
see
what
the
other
vintages
have
to
offer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
i
can
do
little
more
than
sip
this
intense
beverage
nor
would
i
want
to
simply
chug
down
a
vintage
ale
i
paid
nearly
six
bucks
for
i
will
not
be
buying
more
but
it
was
a
worthwhile
experience
until
i
move
to
a
state
with
a
more
abundant
supply
of
less
highend
vintage
barley
wine
i
still
prefer
a
nice
pale
ale
though
or
something
equally
quaffable
as
opposed
to
a
sipper
at
the
relatively
young
age
of
21
i
have
found
the
beer
that
i
cant
possibly
compare
another
to
i
almost
feel
bad
drinking
these
whenever
i
feel
so
inclined
possibly
because
its
so
expensive
but
probably
more
due
to
the
fact
that
i
know
i
couldnt
possibly
enjoy
it
as
much
as
a
man
whose
been
drinking
fine
beer
for
years
and
can
enjoy
its
extreme
complexity
if
you
ever
come
across
this
beer
especially
the
97
vintage
i
urge
you
to
not
pass
up
the
opportunity
to
try
it
out
i
know
its
fairly
moot
to
state
this
but
this
beats
that
one
bottle
of
westy
12
i
had
about
a
month
back
sure
its
all
personal
preference
but
those
are
tall
words
nonetheless
an
interesting
if
very
uneven
brew
in
my
opinion
the
smell
is
enticing
but
the
sweet
sour
dichotomy
and
the
cloying
syrupy
flavor
and
body
make
it
somewhat
difficult
to
finish
ill
try
the
other
years
and
styles
but
i
wont
be
in
a
rush
to
revisit

brandy
like
booziness
and
all
the
other
wonderful
aromas
associated
with
fine
barley
wines
the
taste
here
outshines
the
aroma
a
very
sticky
sweet
malty
base
of
flavour
toffee
and
caramel
hints
of
chocolate
and
anise
sweet
fruity
plums
grapes
and
raisins
black
cherries
currants
and
an
alcohol
spice
the
hops
havent
totally
faded
they
provide
a
well
placed
floralness
in
the
taste
and
just
a
ghostly
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
back
end
that
melds
beautifully
with
that
alcohol
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
outrageous
sublimely
smooth
and
velvety
the
body
of
this
barley
wine
is
full
and
curvaceous
my
god
does
this
taste
outstanding
the
perfect
sipping
brew
on
a
cold
and
wintry
night
in
the
northern
great
plains
a
stashfull
of
these
are
required
in
any
advocates
cellar
sad
to
say
this
is
my
only
bottle
saved
for
the
right
night
to
end
the
year
that
has
been
2004
tastes
like
it
smells
caramel
sherry
and
vanilla
finish
is
sticky
sweet
cream
big
bodied
and
bold
very
flavorful
and
sweet
sweet
sweet
lots
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
but
very
difficult
to
drink
from
the
alcohol
and
the
sweetness
it
is
young
and
good
but
hopefully
my
other
bottle
will
get
better
with
age
sampled
on
cask

at
the

in
downtown
indianapolis
pulls
a
deep
dark
amber
with
that
special
frothy
off
white
head
that
a
proper
pull
provides
although
it
quickly
dissapates
aroma
is
intense
cinnamon
alcohol
and
notes
of
chocolate
taste
is
very
warm
massive
flavors
of
cinnamon
are
most
prevalent
hints
of
alcohol
dark
fruits
and
syrup
are
also
lurking
around
although
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
is
present
this
beer
remains
super
drinkable
excellent
brew
pours
a
hazy
reddish
amber
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
smells
very
fruity
and
malty
hints
at
prunes
and
rasiens
quite
a
sniffer
tastes
exceptional
a
true
delight
to
the
palate
an
explosion
of
taste
tastes
very
fruity
and
datey
such
a
complex
brew
my
taste
buds
are
baffled
by
what
they
are
tasting
this
is
an
interesting
unique
brew
a
barrage
of
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
best
out
there
unbeatable
complexity
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
the

it

for

probably
a

i
will

this
is
a
strong
brew
but
the
smooth
quality
is
exceptional
also
extremely
drinkable
due
to
smoothness
and
understated
alcohol
presence
a
must
drink
for
real
beer
lovers
go
sox
this
is
an
exceptional
example
of
british
craftmanship
at
its
best
at
its
current
age
of
five
years
i
cant
imagine
how
this
can
be
better
but
im
definitely
curious
how
this
will
age
i
suggest
buying
as
many
bottles
as
you
can
afford
and
laying
down
a
few
for
aging
my
only
complaint
is
the
size
of
the
tiny
9
6
oz
bottle
but
this
is
being
greedy
sampled
from
a
1999
oak
cask
at
the
brickskeller
in
washington
dc
on
october
7th
2004
ive
had
several
invarnations
of
this
brew
in
bottles
and
in
a
calvados
cask
but
this
one
was
by
far
the
best
aged
in
new
oak
i
believe
not
port
or
calvados
casks
this
allowed
the
beer
to
express
more
of
its
subtle
characteristics
beerguydave
served
this
baby
at
just
the
right
temperature
for
a
smooth
silky
but
viscous
experience
notes
of
ripe
fruits
port
wine
brown
sugar
and
finally
some
vanilla
in
the
finish
make
this
a
wonderfully
complex
sipper
its
scary
how
drinkable
this
stuff
was
at
11
5
abv
has
a
certain
sweetness
though
that
would
prevent
me
from
downing
too
much
however
besides
all
good
things
are
best
in
moderation
at
11
5
in
theory
this
barleywine
would
be
a
chore
to
down
but
it
is
very
smooth

is
good

1997

pours
a

very
little

taste
full

good
balance
though
more
towards
the
malt
very
winelike
in
a
good
way
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
really
good
baltic
porter
in
taste
like
stepan

only
fuller
in

alcohol
not
overwhelming
this
one
is
enjoyable
all
the

through

will
try
again

malty
lots
of

about

malty

a

i
understand

very
well
this
is
a

among

beers
if
you
havent
tried
this
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
do
whatever
you
can
to
obtain

you

it
took
me
2
hours
to
finish
one
but
it
was
a
lovely
two
hours
full
syrupy
body
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
but
id
make
sure
i
got
one
each
year
now
whether
its
worth
the
price
per
bottle
is
another
matter
altogether
i
still
think
this
is
wonderfull
beer
1997
vintage
picked
off
the
shelves
of
the
wonderful
greens
discount
beverage
on
buford
highway
today
the
body
was
reddish
brown
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
and
no
head
as
can
be
anticipated
with
a
seven
year
old
brew
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
raisins
licorice
and
soy
sauce
the
taste
is
incredibly
bright
and
fruity
for
a
beer
of
this
age
i
can
detect
grapes
figs
apples
pears
and
apricots
there
is
not
even
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
the
yeast
is
dusty
and
zesty
but
seems
to
have
thrived
for
quite
a
while
in
the
bottle
the
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
as
the
alcohol
content
is
enough
to
make
you
keel
over
unless
you
are
vigilant
the
only
downfall
is
the
extreme
sweetness
of
the
beer
but
that
comes
with
the
territory
i
suppose
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
recent
vintages
of
the
beer
i
may
also
find
and
keep
another
1997
for
10
or
20
years
to
see
what
will
happen
first
off
thanks
to
clvand0
for
the
opportunity
to
taste
this
beer
at
just
shy
of
15
years
of
cellar
time
the
color
is
a
nice
flat
brown
and
the
head
is
under
a
finger
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
smells
just
like
raisin
bread
i
want
to
spread
some
butter
on
it
and
eat
it
up
the
flavor
is
nice
its
like
a
raisin
but
with
a
chocolate
feel
in
the
back
of
my
throat
wow
i
love
it
even
better
than
what
i
remember
it
the
feel
is
full
on
thick
damn
good
stuff
drinkability
is
great
as
well
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
love
it
taste
goes
up
to
a
5
when
poured
the
appearance
was
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
it
also
was
quite
cloudy
and
never
really
settled
right
after
pouring
the
scent
was
overpoweringly
alcoholic
i
let
this
one
settle
a
bit
and
the
dark
fruit
and
sugary
smells
crept
through
making
for
a
much
more
pleasing
aroma
the
taste
starts
off
very
sweetly
with
signs
of
various
fruits
and
some
malt
it
has
a
slight
alcohol
after
taste
but
a
pleasant
one
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
think
and
full
and
very
smooth
a
very
drinkable
brew
for
its
high
abv
i
will
defiantly
be
picking
up
more
of
these
to
age
for
a
few
years
this
has
aged
superbly
the
high
abv
is
masked
by
a
super
sweet
slightly
smoky
malt
presence
finishes
with
almost
a
portlike
flavor
after
a
few
sips
im
reeling
from
the
alcohol
this
is
good
but
deadly
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
an
exceptionally
flavorful
beer
easy
to
drink
and
i
certainly
would
have
enjoyed
another
the
body
was
so
thick
and
full
it
was
truly
heavenly
to
feel
this
beer
in
your
mouth
i
couldnt
possibly
describe
or
critique
it
but
i
need
to
mention
that
it
was
pure
passion
seriously
this
is
a
murky
brown
colored
brew
small
tan
head
on
top
scent
is
woody
alcoholic
and
malty
the
taste
is
really
sweet
up
front
and
has
some
raisonplum
tones
alcohol
is
felt
but
tastewise
it
is
blended
well
syrupy
feel
sticks
all
the
way
down
hops
are
there
but
the
malts
keep
them
from
making
a
big
scene
excellent
brew

i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
could
at
least
try
i
cant
imagine
letting
this
age
too
much
longer
id
be
afraid
of
missing
some
of
the
goodness
that
the
malt
decompensation
would
bring
i
have
an
02
that
ill
let
ride
until
06
it
keeps
going
through
my
mind
im
drinking
sixteen
year
old
beer
my
oldest
beer
sampled
to
date
wow
loads
of
very
tiny
sediment
floating
in
the
brew
rubyambermahogany
colored
with
absolutely
no
head
or
anything
resembling
carbonation
aroma
is
exquisite
notes
of
vanilla
port
wine
sherry
brown
sugar
cherries
and
alcohol
wow
complexity
in
the
nose
for
sure
flavor
is
very
sweet
the
whole
way
through
hops
are
not
much
of
a
factor
at
this
point
but
it
retains
a
nice
rich
maltiness
candylike
sweetness
and
warming
alcohol
take
over
the
aftertaste
chunks
of
sediment
remaining
in
the
bottle
are
huge
this
bottle
may
be
past
its
prime
but
its
quite
delicious
right
now
very
impressive
i
feel
as
though
i
am
not
worthy
thanks
to
irishredrock
for
this
oldie
but
goodie
this
is
a
fine
english
barleywine
that
one
should
savor
it
is
perfect
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
sweet
honey
it
is
a
close
second
to
tom
hardys
which
seems
to
balance
the
sweetness
with
a
little
more
alcohol
flavor

very
interesting
and
rich
classic
english
barley
wine
this
was
on
tap
though
i
will
have
to
give
the
bottle
a
shot
just
because
all
the
positive
reviews
here
are
surely
aged
bottles
and
ill
bet
it
gets
better
with
age
we
shall
see
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
really
liked
certain
characteristics
but
really
disliked
others
not
sure
what
to
make
of
the
beer
as
a
whole
but
i
wont
be
in
a
hurry
to
give
it
another
try
big
thanks
to
blatzman
for
the
bottle
slightly
hazy
brown
with
suspended
chunks
of
sediment
nearly
no
head
slightly
vinous
slightly
sour
aroma
diacetyl
and
sweet
malts
dominate
both
aroma
and
taste
big
complex
beer
but
it
still
tastes
like
crap
honey
licorice
molasses
and
raw
sugar
make
this
a
sickly
sweet
brew
that
ends
with
a
slightly
sour
bitter
finish
that
in
no
way
cuts
the
cloying
syrupy
aspect
i
have
a
couple
other
vintages
from
the
mid
90s
that
i
will
try
after
i
let
them
mellow
for
a
while
longer
i
sure
hope
they
get
better
with
age
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
warming
in
fact
this
beer
is
a
huge
belly
warmer
i
was
planning
on
having
the
dfh
olde
school
barley
wine
after
this
but
the
275
ml
seems
about
perfect
the
1999
vintage
ale
appearance
ruby
tone
with
a
semi
hazy
coat
on
cream
head
forms
rather
thin
head
leaves
behind
even
layers
of
lacing
nice
aroma
rich
sugary
sweetness
with
nutty
toasted
caramel
malt
character
extremely
complex
layer
of
hops
east
kent
goldings
according
to
the
label
very
piney
in
nature
taste
sugary
complex
layers
of
malt
and
bitter
hop
finish
seems
very
smooth
for
11
5
abv
but
wow
what
a
barleywine
could
be
the
most
interesting
one
to
cross
my
palate
yet
mouthfeel
full
bodied
brew
syrupy
like
texture
nice
and
sticky
wow
even
reserved
carbonation
butterscotch
like
drinkability
a
special
occasion
once
in
awhile
experience
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
a
case
of
but
its
so
damn
tasty
the
one
thing
is
the
sugar
sweetness
can
be
a
bit
overbearing
all
in
all
its
incredible
i
am
wowed
drinks
exceptionally
well
for
what
it
is
very
warming
the
aromatic
and
flavorful
nuances
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
scratching
my
head
along
the
way
is
this
stuff
for
real
it
simply
must
be
experienced
in
this
rare
form
thank
you
to
mydeadguy
for
the
beer
for
my
500th
karma
point
a
simply
fantastic
barleywine
easily
one
of
the
worlds
best
smooth
like
a
port
wine
yet
with
a
nice
but
not
harsh
alcohol
and
hop
kick
to
it
definitely
one
id
look
for
in
the
future
the
eye
is
filled
with
a
nice
ruby
to
garnet
look
and
topped
with
a
very
nice
bit
of
foam
that
laces
with
sticky
clumps
heavy
cloying
feel
and
the
drinkability
is
interrupted
by
this
and
the
abv
just
sampled
the
1986
vintage
and
it
was
amazing
it
was
pretty
much
as
expected
but
i
was
surprised
that
it
had
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
but
sip
it
you
will
want
to
taste
every
drop
taste
was
huge
big
thick
body
and
mouthfeel
on
this
bad
boy
big
taste
on
caramel
figs
plums
finishes
with
some
toffee
call
me
crazy
but
the
finish
almost
tastes
like
drinking
tea
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
love
it
what
a
great
sipper
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
vintages
as
well
potent
sweet
malty
caramel
and
lightly
alcoholic
aroma
dark
burgundy
colored
beer
tan
head
composed
of
fine
bubbles
that
fades
to

hints
of

and

slick
sweet
aftertaste
that
is
a
bit
overpowering
a
strong
flavorful
beer
that
is
best
sipped
on
a
cool
winter
evening
i
think
i
have
to
take
minute
to
talk
about
this
beer
i
have
never
tried
a
beer
that
was
this
old
it
was
certainly
a
different
experience
i
am
not
exactly
sure
how
to
rate
this
beer
so
i
will
do
my
best
however
that
being
said
i
would
strongly
recomend
trying
experiments
such
as
this
i
feel
that
this
is
the
english
equivalent
to
lambics
in
an
esoteric
nature
but
where
lambics
should
be
drank
amidst
a
good
conversation
at
a
dark
bar
this
beer
should
be
drank
from
a
snifter
in
contemplative
solitude
on
a
cold
winters
eve
this
is
a
great
deep
amber
colored
body
althoug
theres
little
to
no
head
its
still
a
beautiful
beer
the
aroma
is
mainly
walnuts
and
honey
the
flavor
is
just
a
little
too
sweet
this
is
very
meadlike
a
little
syrupy
it
would
be
best
as
an
afterdinner
sipper
i
think
this
a
very
complex
beer
i
didnt
even
scratch
the
surface
i
didnt
give
the
malt
presence
enough
adulation
nor
did
i
address
the
gullet
warming
abilities
of
this
brew
hell
it
cant
be
a
surprise
considering
the
alcohol
content
overall
great
beer
but
past
its
prime
im
curious
to
give
my
86
a
try
a
comforting
beer
every
time
out
so
my
scores
reflect
other
vintages
as
well
as
the
particular
one

like
to
try
an
older
vintage
a
review
of
the
vintage
harvest
ale
2000
this
is
a
great
beer
to
wind
down
with
on
a
cold
winter
night
it
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
aroma
with
traces
of
alcohol
and
fruit
this
cloudy
ambercopper
beer
is
capped
with
a
good
sustaining
head
it
has
a
doughy
mouthfeel
and
i
found
the
taste
to
be
brandylike
with
caramel
figs
and
oak
the
lace
is
good
and
it
finishes
with
a
slight
bittersweet
taste
it
is
a
bit
pricey
but
well
worth
it
its
potency
became
apparent
as
i
wrote
my
original
notes
1997
vintage
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
bierkraft
in
nyc
for
6
or
so
a
good
purchase
for
sure
this
classic
brew
poured
out
a
nice
dark
reddish
colour
with
plenty
of
inherent
carbonation
the
aromas
were
all
across
the
board
and
very
hardys
like
at
times
the
aromas
consisted
of
dark
fruits
spicy
alcohol
deep
deep
roasted
malts
and
very
freshly
cut
bitter
herbal
grassy
sappy
piney
hops
over
the
years
the
hops
have
been
cut
down
to
size
and
the
malt
really
dominates
in
this
brews
taste
but
that
is
ok
to
me
this
is
a
classic
brew
that
6
years
of
aging
has
totally
rounded
into
a
new
dimension
of
complexity
and
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
but
ill
knock
a
point
off
for
the
lack
of
liveliness
the
drinkability
is
only
marred
by
the
super
strong
abv
a
classic
drinkability
for
me
this
will
be
a
barleywine
style
standard
too
pricey
for
extended
drinking
but
worth
every
penny
will
seek
this
out
every
xmas
and
thus
begins
my
true
appreciation
for
aged
ales
this
beer
has
a
presence
that
dominates
your
senses
and
leaves
you
totally
satisfied
all
beers
should
be
this
good
at
6
00
a
bottle
this
is
not
your
everyday
beer
but
it
is
worth
drinking
on
occasion
i
do
have
the
2002
vintage
waitingshould
i
open
it
now
or
save
it
for
later
a
great
beer
one
ill
definitely
on
the
lookout
for
other
vintages
wow
this
is
a
huge
beer
very
portlike
pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
ample
tan
head
aroma
is
oh
so
sweet
and
malty
also
raisins
molasses
and
buttery
toffee
taste
is
incredibly
sweet
and
smooth
caramel
toffee
raisins
some
coffee
ends
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
grain
thank
god
for
it
because
otherwise
this
would
be
the
sweetest
thing
ive
ever
tasted
gives
you
a
nice
warm
toasty
feeling
as
well
perfect
for
a
winters
night
drinkability

even
sitting
at
three
years
old
this
barley
wine
seems
young
not
quite
raw
but
just
seems
to
still
be
blending
its
flavors
together
id
let
this
one
sit
and
continue
to
mature
for
a
few
more
years
and
see
what
amazing
complexities
continue
to
develop
id
like
to
shelve
some
more
of
these
and
seek
out
an
older
vintage
to
sample
deep
amber
brown
appearance
with
a
light
fluffy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
fruitbutter
and
alcohol
taste
is
fruity
with
thick
malt
and
butter
and
a
dash
of
hops
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
buttery
with
a
light
oily
feel
this
beer
was
still
very
young
and
i
will
let
the
other
age
a
bit
longer
to
see
where
it
goes
outstanding
this
is
a
5
year
old
bottle
maybe
any
hop
presence
that
was
there
at
a
younger
age
has
faded
maybe
it
still
needs
a
few
years
for
the
malts
to
mellow
one
way
or
the
other
this
bottle
wasnt
quite
my
cup
of
tea
the
store
i
purchased
it
from
has
98
99
00
and
01
vintages
maybe
ill
try
to
pick
up
a
younger
vintage
to
see
how
they
compare
i
had
the
privilege
to
drink
some
cask
96
j
w
lees
harvest
this
weekend
at
the
moan
dove
in
amherst
ma
poured
directly
from
the
cask
there
is
no
visible
head
or
carbonation
its
a
serious
cask
barleywine
color
is
a
gemlike
clear
mahogany
and
it
appears
to
be
fairly
thick
from
the
way
it
clings
to
the
glass
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
whiskey
and
brandy
and
a
little
bit
of
sweet
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
without
being
syrupy
however
my
cask
lees
was
served
appropriately
at
room
temperature
which
allowed
the
flavors
to
fully
blossom
immediately
upon
sipping
taste
is
very
oakey
and
reminiscent
of
a
fine
brandy
at
first
then
is
rounded
out
with
ample
sweetness
and
notes
of
coffee
in
the
finish
alcohol
presence
is
certainly
noticeable
in
the
before
during
and
after
sipping
but
it
does
not
overcome
any
of
the
complex
flavor
and
the
lees
is
actually
quite
smooth
a
rare
treat
to
say
the
least

at

until
thomas
hardys
hits
the

along
with

of
flavors
rich

a
mild
limelike
bitterness
and
beautifully
balanced
warming
alcohol
add
just
the
right
amount
of
contrast
to
this
exceptionally
wellcrafted
brew
add
a
touch
of
creamy
sherry
and
you
get
the
picture
bring
on
the
winter
1998
vintage
enjoyed
at
the
october
2003
ba
gathering
at
lucky
baldwins
the
head
was
almost
nonexistent
what
did
appear
on
pouring
disappeared
almost
immediately
what
remains
is
sort
of
a
swampy
brown
its
appearance
does
not
do
justice
to
what
follows
the
smell
is
a
wonderful
mix
of
ripe
fruit
raisins
dates
hints
of
cherry
and
a
nice
molasses
smell
hops
are
barely
detectable
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
a
vintage
port
and
provides
the
same
warming
experience
found
in
a
fine
port
although
some
alcohol
smell
and
taste
is
present
it
blends
very
well
and
doesnt
hint
at

glad
i
tried
this

and
would
really

with
some

people

some
share

with

masterful
finish
some
fruitcake
with
rum
and
a
bit
of
unsurprisingly
and
notthatsubtle

heat
great
drinkability

style
simply
an
outstanding
example
of
a
big
beer
and
one
well
worth
stocking
in
the
closet
for
over
a
year
this
was
a

2001
sample
this
brew
poured
a
small
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
light
brown
bubbles
that
as
it
receded
left
very
little
lacing
its
body
was
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
it
has
an
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
spice
with
some
fruity
notes
it
had
a
burnt
taste
that
was
awful
yuck
what
a
drain
pour
was
this
sample
bad
maybe
ill
have
to
sample
another
one
if
i
can
brave
myself
to
try
it
again
this
ale
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
no
foam
or
carbonation
apparent
the
smell
was
wonderful
smooth
caramel
figs
raisins
alcohol
the
taste
was
moderately
sweet
malt
with
figs
raisin
molasses
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
butter
a
very
complex
and
exquisite
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
warming
it
was
light
on
the
tongue
but
left
a
residual
thick
sweet
taste
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
was
nonexistent
this
was
an
incredibly
awesome
barley
wine
but
due
to
the
strength
and
fullness
i
really
cannot
say
that
i
want
to
drink
many
at
one
sitting
appearance
is
a
brownish
amber
no
head
to
speak
of
but
i
would
not
expect
much
of
one
for
the
style
the
aroma
contains
an
immediate
blast
of
alcohol

by
a
malty

qualities
in

exceptional
this
beer
is
deceptively
easy
to
drink
given
the
high
alcohol
content
sublime
joy
in
the
glass
this
beer
is
a
bit
different
but
i
could
see
why
many
like
it
its
a
musttry
for
any
serious
beer
drinker
i
tried
some
of
the
1980s
vintages
and
was
disappointed
this
is
2000
and
its
wonderful
it
smells
good
from
two
feet
away
its
huge
al
k
hall
we
all
know
him
aroma
is
attractive
i
get
raisins
and
caramel
again
from
two
feet
away
the
mouthfeel
is
velvet
this
is
the
nightcap
beer
stock
up
in
comparison
with
the
13
year
old
vintage
this
relatively
younger
vintage
is
much
brighter
in
carbonation
and
flavor
profile
as
with
the
older
version
tons
of
sweet
maple
syrup
prunes
dates
and
overripe
orchard
fruit
dominate
the
flavor
profile
more
hops
are
evident
not
yet
having
faded
away
the
alcohol
seems
a
bit
more
prominent
at
34
years
old
this
beer
still
seems
a
bit
young
and
would
benefit
from
a
couple
of
years
of
mellowing
hmm
13
years
seemed
a
bit
too
long
4
years
not
quite
enough
ill
just
have
to
keep
sampling
to
determine
the
magic
number
1998
vintage
by
the
sip
not
the
gulp
heavy
molasses
and
heavy
alcohol
definitely
a
dessert
drink
the
taste
is
quite
overwhelming
drinkability
is
saved
only
by
the
sweetness
flavorful
but
i
could
probably
drink
a
worldwide
stout
23
abv
twice
as
fast
thick
sweet
very
alcoholic
tastey
but
its
kind
of
like
putting
a
little
too
much

bottling
i
realize
i
may
be
reviewing
this
one
too
soon
but
i
couldnt
wait
this
beer
poured
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
and
formed
a
small
off
white
head
that
left
some
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
a
heavy
aroma
of
malt
caramel
raisins
and
other
dark
fruit
a
slight
hint
of
the
alcohol
is
also
present
a
flavor
of
malt
caramel
and
raisinsplums
with
a
slight
vinous
quality
but
without
leaning
too
much
into
wine
or
hard
liquor
as
some
others
do
a
slightly
syrupy
finish
but
not
enough
to
damage
it
just
push
it
into
more
of
a
sipping
style
with
at
this
alcohol
level
it
should
be
would
make
a
fine
after
dinner
beer
and
will
no
likely
improve
with
age
1997
vintage
had
this
on
cask
at
chalkies
clear
deep
copper
with
no
head
has
a
very
strong
alcohol
aroma
with
notes
of
smoke
scotch
and
sweet
malt
flavor
is
very
sweet
but
not
what
id
call
cloying
very
complex
begins
with
very
sweet
caramel
and
butterscotch
then
some
smokey
peatlike
flavors
finishing
a
little
bit
spicey
had
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
but
had
a
very
full
and
smooth
mouthfeel
a
wonderful
sipping
beer
overall
a
very
nice
and
complex
winter
sippen
ale
full
of
alcohol
warmth
with
lots
of
malty
citrus
and
spice
flavors
the
92
may
be
starting
to
go
there
were
a
few
medicine
and
metallic
flavors
trying
to
get
out
as
if
the
yeast
was
done
and
the
malt
was
ready
to
start
breaking
down
1988
must
have
not
been
stored
right
flat
no
carbonation
sweet
sugary
caramel
aroma
tasted
like
maple
syrup
too
sweet
two
sips
and
dumped
the
rest
1997
was
much
better
very
small
head
strong
caramel
aroma
smooth
sweet
caramel
toffee
flavor
this
is
what
i
will
rate
the
1988
was
ruined
1997
vintage
a
very
dense
thin
tan
head
sits
atop
this
darkruby
beer
the
smell
is
fantastic
a
woody
complex
malt
and
grain
aroma
big
on
the
malt
sweetness
but
also
considerable
butterscotch
and
toffee
tastes
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
exceptionally
complex
simply
outstanding
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
deliberately
more
malt
than
ol
crusty
more
hop
than
ol
foghorn
as
ive
ever
tasted
from
the
uk
this
beer
explodes
w
hopflavor
and
bitterness
all
ek
golding
grassiness
and
fruity
pine
massive
amounts
of
malt
must
be
used
in
this
brew
and
much
remains
in
the
sweet
honey
like
full
bodied
flavors
that
stack
up
to
the
uncommonly
strong
hop
presence
as
this
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
notes
came
through
a
bit
more
but
only
a
bit
as
the
thickness
and
hoppiness
hide
the
alcohol
very
well
if
there
were
dyacitals
and
funky
alcohol
flavors
i
couldnt
find
them
the
warmth
down
the
throat
and
into
your
veins
keeps
you
aware
of
the
hugeness
of
what
your
sipping
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
british
barleywine
ive
ever
had
and
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
made
beers
aged
before
release
exceptionally
well
balanced
humongously
massive
in
every
way
as
the
bottle
states
this
beer
is
brewed
as
a
celebration
of
the
brewers
art
imho
i
think
jw
lees
has
done
just
that
fck
yeah
i
love
drinking
a
great
beer
for
the
first
time
outstanding
high
in
alcohol
the
type
you
want
to
sip
but
the
type
you
cant
keep
your
hands
away
from
grabbing
the
minute
you
put
it
down
fascinating
drinking
experience
i
get
a
sweet
fruity
nose
with
some
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
the
taste
is
incredible
huge
dark
fruits
definitely
plum
maybe
some
prunes
dark
cherries
the
brown
sugar
is
there
as
is
the
molassis
and
dare
i
say
some
odd
hints
of
coconut
the
nose
immediately
reminded
me
of
a
champagne
or
wine
or
something
the
flavor
though
is
more
like
a
port
or
brandy
with
a
nice
hit
of
brown
sugar
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
transcendes
the
entire
beer
drinking
experience
there
is
no
barley
wine
finer

by
a

bitterness
is
muted
and
is
overpowered
by
malt
sweetness

slowly
1997
the
beer
pours
a
deep
garnet
with
a
decent
head
unbelievable
sweet
fruity
tones
on
the
nose
and
some
alcohol
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
very
sherry
like
very
nice
residual
sugars
are
evident
tastes
of
brown
sugar
and
candied
apple
very
nice
taste
a
little
bitterness
perceived
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overbearing
this
is
very
good
but
the
98
vintage
i
had
a
couple
nights

was
better
1997

big

some
earthy

chocolate
and
more
maltiness
those
are
just
a
few
of
the
flavors
that
i
am
pulling
off
of
this
one
i
cant
even
identify
some
of
them
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
and
pretty
damn
drinkable
for
a
bw
this
was
an
absolutely
awesome
brew
if
you
love
barley
wines
like
i
do
then
you
have
to
get
some
of
these
a
great
special
occasion

might
have
to

nice

presence
complex
asertive
flavors
but
easy
to
drink
unlike
some
barley
wines
this
is
what
an
aging
beer
should
taste
like
lucky
for
us
b
united
the
us
importer
ages
these
beers
for
us
and
periodically
releases
some
of
them
rumor
is
that
they
are
still
sitting
on
some
88
i
currently
have
97
and
98
on
the
shelf
due
to
these
wonderful
people
its
still
out
there
to
be
had
go
hunt
some
down
notes
last
time
a
tried
one
of
these
it
was
a
bottle
of
the
1986
i
believe
it
was
staggering
for
being
around
a
year
and
a
half
old
at
the
time
of
this
review
the
2000
is
simply
to
die
for
theres
so
much
complexity
of
flavour
going
on
that
you
almost
need
to
stop
analyzing
and
simply
enjoy
it
before
the
glass
is
empty
alcohol
is
still
a
bit
boisterous
as
well
as
the
forceful
fruitiness
jam
packed
with
flavour
with
a
similarity
to
a
port
or
sherry
minus
the
carbonation
i
preferred
this
year
over
1997
due
to
it
being
a
bit
more
robust
and
over
the
top
for
a
barley
wine
for
ccb
im
disappointed
in
this
one
at
huna
15
the
14
variant
so
very
tasty
huna
day
tap
pour
is
murky
brown
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
booze
i
cant
detect
apple
brandy
but
its
a
super
smooth
ba
barley
flavor
rich
mildly
sweet
and
moderately
complex
with
a
hint
of
sherry
great
beer
ive
been
wanting
to
try
a
while
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
falls
a
hair
short
of
king
henry
and
a
deal
with
the
devil
both
of
those
had
a
more
interesting
barrel
character
and
more
balanced
sweetness
leon
is
an
outstanding
near
magical
elixir
it
has
been
well
over
two
years
since
a
beer
has
blown
me
away
like
this
and
completely
shown
me
the
pinnacle
of
a
style
i
cant
think
of
a
way
to
make
this
any
better
super
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
and
wish
there
had
been
much
more
possibly
my
favorite
barleywine
to
date
looong
time
want
good
way
to
start
2015
the
apple
is
still
there
in
the
nose
and
taste
the
body
is
slightly
thin
missing
a
bit
of
heft
very
tasty
flavor
wouldnt
consider
this
world
class
however
interested
to
try
batch
2
dont
see
this
one
improving
any
more
infected
tasted
like
grape
bubblegum
overall
a
very
very
nice
barleywine
that
has
a
few
stout
notes
to
it
the
almond
amaretto
notes
make
this
a
memorable
and
unique
barleywine
great
job
and
i
was
thrilled
to
get
this
tick
really
warm
and
sweet
nose
on
this
deep
amberbrown
body
with
minimal
carb
the
brandy
really
gives
a
warm
booziness
on
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
really
nice
malty
barleywine
that
essentially
acts
as
a
vessel
for
the
brandy
it
looks
a
little
thin
and
id
say
that
the
mouthfeel
is
true
to
that
for
such
a
big
boozy
barleywine
it
almost
made
it
a
bit
easier
to
drink
though
and
added
a
slickness
very
tasty
dessert
beer
overall
a
dramatic
improvement
over
church
on
a
hill
but
cognac
church
is
still
the
revelation
of
the
bunch
mouth
med
to
fuller
bod
syrupy
o
overall
this
beer
was
mighty
tasty
super
smooth
pours
a
deep
caramel
brownish
color
with
minimal
head
and
heavy
visual
weight
the
nose
is
strong
with
caramel
and
raisin
coming
first
the
apple
brandy
influence
brings
on
heavy
green
apple
notes
which
support
the
caramelized
malt
bill
taste
starts
with
some
brown
sugar
and
caramel
notes
followed
by
more
green
apple
a
bit
of
caramel
apple
notes
come
out
and
everything
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
well
balanced
a
bit
of
booze
at
the
back
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
mildly
carbonated
overall
a
delicious
barleywine
that
is
reminiscent
of
king
henry
and
bcbbw
very
good
m
big
medium
bodied
o
generally
i
tend
to
shy
away
from
brandy
barrel
aged
beers
due
to
the
overwhelming
sweetness
most
of
them
tend
to
have
but
this
fits
the
style
really
well
and
uses
the
brandy
barrel
to
great
results
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
small
beige
head
aromas
of
brandy
figs
dates
oak
brown
sugar
caramel
and
white
raisins
flavor
of
brandy
pralines
dates
pecans
toasted
and
caramel
malts
and
brown
sugar
mediumbodied
with
a
malty
boozy
mouthfeel
and
mellow
carbonation
what
a
wonderful
treat
and
would
love
to
try
this
again
many
times
too
overall
outstanding
much
like
many
in
this
style
the
feel
could
be
a
little
fuller
smoother
and
creamier
for
top
marks
but
that
is
a
minor
complaint
the
nose
on
this
one
was
as
good
as
it
gets
and
that
translated
into
an
absolutely
fantastic
taste
profile
as
well
this
is
one
of
the
best
ba
barelywines
out
there
again
cigar
city
shows
me
that
we
were
just
meant
to
be
well
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
this
is
one
id
love
to
drink
again
at
some
point
cheers
again
for
the
brews
urwithdave

pours
a

the

touches

and
a

note
its
full
bodied
rich
and
creamy
drinks
quite
well
despite
the
abv
which
adds
character
rather
than
making
it
daunting
quite
a
nice
drinking
barleywine
o
this
is
a
great
unique
example
of
a
barrelaged
barleywine
the
applefruity
flavor
is
such
a
nice
compliment
to
the
vanilla
and
other
notes
that
i
was
expecting
surprise
surprise
i
still
prefer
king
henry
but
this
is
right
up
there
with
barrelaged
hifi
rye
in
my
book
my
first
barleywine
from
cigar
city
and
definitely
not
a
disappointment
o
an
awesome
barleywine
really
delicious
and
easy
drinking
this
is
very
worth
seeking
out
good
but
not
outstanding
might
benefit
significantly
from
a
year
or
two
in
solitary
hunahpu
pour

murky

apple
biscuts
flavor
is
like
nothing
i
have
had
cotton
candy
toffee
biscuts
and
vanilla
in
the
flavor
super
duper
sweet
as
it
sounds
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
bit
sweet
and
that
sweet
lingers
for
a
good
while
so
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
and
sharing
8
oz
with
one
other
person
was
plenty
pretty
rich
o
i
wouldnt
say
this
quite
stacks
up
to
kh
but
overall
in
my
opinion
its
probably
the
second
best
barleywine
ive
had
its
not
quite
as
smooth
or
complex
as
kh
and
kh
beats
it
in
almost
every
category
except
aroma
i
felt
like
leon
hid
the
booze
a
little
bit
better
in
the
nose
overall
i
believe
this
is
a
worldclass
barleywine
from
ccb
that
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
luckily
i
still
have
a
bottle
left
i
hope
to
revisit
this
in
the
future
flawless
o
overall
i
had
had
a
fresh
2012
bottle
of
moas
the
night
before
and
while
i
preferred
moas
to
this
to
be
fair
moas
is
one
of
my
favorite
ba
barleywines
this
was
really
great
and
just
a
step
below
it
i
think
the
nose
is
amazing
on
this
beer
and
it
definitely
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
a
little
hotter
and
a
little
sweeter
than
moas
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
and
think
aging
it
a
few
months
would
probably
lead
to
it
being
even
better
one
of
the
better
cigar
city
beers
ive
had
definitely
seek
it
out
ok
have
to
confess
id
rather
have
church
on
a
hill
either
version
than
leon
but
this
is
still
an
excellent
beer
mike
you
are
a
saint
let
st
peter
know
you
have
an
excellent
reference
if
he
asks
this
one
pours
with
more
of
a
red
hue
than
most
barleywines
the
smell
is
sweet
and
a
bit
fruity
there
is
a
good
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
in
the
flavor
this
one
had
more
balance
than
most
of
the
other
barleywines
we
had
im
getting
some
caramel
and
dark
fruit
along
with
heat
from
the
barrel
the
alcohol
builds
towards
the
finish
im
going
to
sit
on
my
bottle
and
see
how
time
treats
this
beer
o
extremely
good
beer
would
love
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
cheers
o
a
very
good
barleywine
you
can
tell
that
the
base
beer
was
pretty
hoppy
which
i
think
works
with
the
beer
super
smooth
well
made
beer
it
was
well
balanced
enough
that
it
never
got
too
sweet
or
too
boozy
despite
copious
amounts
of
each
in
various
individual
sips
maybe
not
the
very
best
ba
barleywine
ive
had
but
in
the
tier
just
below
it
o
overall
really
good
is
it
as
good
as
people
say
well
thats
for
you
to
decide
but
this
is
certainly
not
just
hype
without
backup
super
duper
tasty
and
super
smooth
quality
stuff
reminded
me
a
ton
of
the
north
coast
barrel
aged
old
stock
similar
price
point
to
that
would
prevent
me
from
buyingtrading
for
another
but
a
must
try
once
big
thanks
to
starrdogg
for
opening
this
one
served
in
a
cigar
city
snifter
the
nose
carries
a
pretty
strong
aroma
of
apple
brandy
with
some
nice
sweetness
coming
from
that
malty
sweetness
with
faint
fruit
and
caramel
comes
behind
that
flavor
is
a
bit
too
barrel
heavy
but
still
quite
nice
a
bit
of
booze
but
not
too
much
for
a
13
5
beer
o
a
tick
is
a
tick
but
the
rarity
and
taste
dont
match
i
guess
it
was
worth
the
tick
but
i
dont
plan
on
seeking
one
out
again
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
it
is
thick
and
sticky
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
not
hiding
here
despite
plenty
of
residual
sweetness
and
malt
character
ccb
has
been
knocking
barrel
aged
beers
out
of
the
park
this
is
nothing
new
but
most
recently
i
gotta
give
the
nod
to
the
cognac
versions
over
this
brandy
still
a
mighty
fine
brew
if
you
have
the
chance
you
should
get
your
hands
on
some
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
and
brandy
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
and
a
woody
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
o
big
sweet
barleywine
that
really
showcases
the
apple
brandy
presence
which
added
a
nice
finish
and
complexity
pours
a
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
excellent
the
vanilla
from
the
oak
is
prominent
and
it
has
a
great
hint
of
apple
as
well
flavor
is
also
very
nice
oak
vanilla
and
apple
stand
out
and
it
is
finishes
with
some
earthy
roastiness
it
isnt
nearly
as
sweet
as
most
brandy
aged
beers
and
tastes
more
like
apple
bourbon
its
very
well
balanced
and
quite
smooth
given
the
abv
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
damn
tasty
ba
barley
wine
o
very
layered
and
complex
sweet
then
hoppy
then
fruity
love
it
o
very
complex
aroma
and
flavor
that
had
me
fiending
for
another
sip
after
i
had
finished
my
glass
very
delicious
o
this
is
a
flatout
really
good
beer
i
didnt
have
the
opportunity
to
try
the
base
beer
but
the
apple
brandy
treatment
works
wonderfully
with
the
flavors
highly
recommended
just
a
really
wellmade
beer
the
apple
brandy
turns
what
was
a
below
average
barleywine
chuch
on
a
hill
into
a
supertasty
barrelaged
bw
im
already
looking
forward
to
the
next
bottle
as
i
was
able
to
luck
into
a
couple
of
bottles
this
is
a
musttry
from
ccb
and
as
good
as
the
cognac
version
love
this
beer
o
a
very
interesting
take
on
a
barleywine
with
the
aroma
being
the
highlight
but
the
thin
body
and
amount
of
sweetness
prevents
it
from
being
a
top
tier
barleywine
in
my
opinion
thanks
voxomkid
for
the
opportunity
overall
nice
english
barleywine
i
think
its
a
bit
over
hyped
but
it
really
did
enjoy
it
none
the
less
this
is
my
first
apple
brandy
ba
beer
and
it
adds
a
whole
new
level
of
complexity
to
a
beer
style
that
is
my
favorite
beer
style
a
very
good
ba
english
barleywine
but
not
deserving
of
the
rating
that
its
getting
right
now
now
the
new
ccb
imperial
sweet
stout
thats
a
different
story
thanks
egrace84
o
best
barleywine
ive
had
thus
far
though
ive
never
had
any
of
the
big
whales
overall
its
a
fantastic
beer
great
range
and
character
with
nice
barrel
treatment
character
only
spot
its
missing
is
the
appearance
very
very
good
oforget
the
bourbon
ba
barleywines
the
apple
brandy
barrel
hits
the
spot
on
this
style
i
hope
ccb
does
another
ab
ba
barleywine
i
would
drink
this
on
a
daily
basis
if
i
had
more
of
it
ccb
crushed
it
on
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
capped
by
a
thin
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
collar
apple
brandy
isnt
terribly
overt
on
the
nose
compared
to
ab
hunahpus
other
reviews
mention
it
being
front
and
center
so
perhaps
theres
bottle
variation
more
dominant
is
dark
fruit
burnt
sugar
and
oak
theres
plenty
of
boozy
barrel
but
its
not
distinctly
apple
brandy
the
palate
is
similar
with
big
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
flavors
boozy
barrel
oak
and
dark
fruit
it
feels
a
tad
thin
to
me
especially
compared
to
the
hunahpus
variations
we
drank
next
to
this
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
terribly
special
this
beer
will
only
improve
in
the
bottle
over
the
next
10
years
i
need
another
to
squirrel
away
in
the
cellar
o
very
good
i
was
waiting
to
open
this
beer
for
the
celebration
of
my
first
son
worth
the
wait
church
on
a
hill
roosevelt
and
now
this
one
cigar
city
is
cranking
out
solid
barleywnes
my
only
complaint
about
this
beer
was
the
bigger
brandy
note
which
seemed
to
distract
me
from
the
base
beer
d
awesome
stuff
and
might
be
even
better
than
the
cognac
version
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
of
this
so
that
i
could
enjoy
it
at
a
more
leisurely
pace
cigar
city
is
on
quite
the
hot
streak
these
days
i
think
abandoning
their
sour
program
has
really
allowed
them
to
concentrate
on
what
they
do
best
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
no
light
shining
through
at
all
slight
foamy
tan
head
that
dissipated
to
a
frothy
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
while
sipping
smells
of
brown
sugar
toffee
and
the
brandy
comes
through
taste
is
much
of
the
same
but
with
an
amazing
warmth
in
my
chest
after
just
my
first
sip
burnt
sugar
toffee
and
dark
fruit
really
broke
through
after
it
warmed
this
was
a
great
english
style
barleywine
non
of
that
sticky
resinous
hop
feel
like
some
if
its
american
barleywine
brethren
o
ive
had
king
henry
and
ive
had
abacus
this
beer
is
my
favorite
compared
to
those
two
giants
maybe
its
because
im
a
sucker
for
anything
stuffed
in
an
apple
brandy
or
calvados
barrel
but
this
is
just
amazing
just
a
really
wellmade
beer
the
apple
brandy
turns
what
was
a
below
average
barleywine
chuch
on
a
hill
into
a
supertasty
barrelaged
bw
im
already
looking
forward
to
the
next
bottle
as
i
was
able
to
luck
into
a
couple
of
bottles
this
is
a
musttry
from
ccb
and
as
good
as
the
cognac
version
overall
an
amazing
english
barleywine
that
has
succeeded
in
supplanting
sucaba
in
my
favorite
ba
barleywines
i
am
so
lucky
to
have
a
second
bottle
to
sit
on
definitely
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
o
this
is
a
flatout
really
good
beer
i
didnt
have
the
opportunity
to
try
the
base
beer
but
the
apple
brandy
treatment
works
wonderfully
with
the
flavors
highly
recommended
nothing
fancy
here
but
a
nice
beer
if
youre
into
a
deep
caramel
mellow
barley
wine
actually
has
a
pretty
nice
color
to
it
clean
and
light
o
okay
beer
most
likely
not
one
that
i
will
pick
up
again
o
a
good
beer
not
really
a
barley
wine
by
my
definition
but
none
the
less
drinkable
and
pretty
decent
imo
o
very
decent
beer
like
the
fact
that
you
can
drink
more
than
one
with
a
slightly
lower
abv
than
most
barley
wines
appears
chesnutt
brown
clear
very
thin
off
white
head
that
fades
smells
stale
oxidized
slightly
sweet
taste
is
malty
a
touch
of
raisin
flavor
not
real
great
flavor
medium
body
and
lower
carbonation
overall
a
disappointment
and
i
dont
think
strong
enough
to
call
a
barleywine
good
not
great
this
english
style
barleywine
is
nice
and
smooth
coppery
and
caramel
malt
forward
but
not
quite
ad
big
and
bold
as
i
have
come
to
expect
the
style
to
be
even
the
english
versions
nice
amber
color
darker
red
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
after
just
a
minute
aromatics
of
well
toasted
cereal
grains
red
malt
caramel
thats
just
a
touch
burnt
and
warming
alcohol
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
but
i
am
impressed
how
the
sweetness
does
not
pollute
the
flavor
or
feel
of
this
beer
the
residual
sugars
are
short
lived
on
the
tongue
which
allows
the
grains
to
be
tasted
for
what
they
are
english
malt
is
obvious
here
mix
of
american
and
english
hops
not
much
carbonation
but
i
suppose
it
suits
the
style
i
also
like
that
its
not
even
8
abv
usually
bigger
barleywines
are
one
and
done
but
i
see
why
they
sell
this
one
in
a
sixpack
gets
better
and
better
as
it
warms
up
too
a
great
evening
slow
sipper
with
a
good
book
odthis
one
is
a
miss
for
me
wont
be
going
back
to
this
beer
pours
a
medium
reddish
copper
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
on
top
smells
of
caramel
toffee
and
light
bready
grainy
malt
light
sulfur
and
a
hint
of
earth
with
a
light
butterscotch
round
out
the
nose
the
flavor
is
biscuity
bready
grainy
maltiness
with
bits
of
toffee
and
butterscotch
light
earthy
hops
flavor
with
a
bit
of
sulfur
provides
a
counter
the
the
malty
sweetness
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
nice
enough
barleywine
the
bready
maltiness
is
nice
but
the
toffee
butterscotch
is
a
bit
too
much
on
my
palette
o
so
ridge
runner
is
definitely
not
a
good
candidate
for
extended
aging
though
barleywine
is
normally
a
style
that
blossoms
with
age
this
one
is
on
the
small
side
of
the
styles
spectrum
and
just
couldnt
stand
up
to
time
ill
have
to
do
a
rereview
sometime
as
this
is
a
beer
ive
had
fresh
many
times
and
find
to
be
quite
pleasing
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
barley
wine
its
enjoyable
and
you
do
not
need
to
sip
it
in
order
to
not
be
overtaken
with
too
much
complexity
its
good
just
not
as
enjoyable
as
say
a
brooklyn
monster
english
barley
wine
othe
abv
is
toned
down
in
this
barleywine
but
the
profile
is
pretty
strong
o
definitely
would
purchase
and
drink
again
i
can
say
you
will
recognize
a
new
taste
every
sip
in
this
beer
it
is
quite
a
treat
well
this
is
a
pretty
big
disappointment
this
feels
like
a
watered
down
representation
of
the
style
poured
a
1
beige
head
which
faded
fast
and
the
body
also
exhauseted
the
effervescence
too
quickly
the
body
is
sienna
brown
in
masstone
but
more
of
an
amber
held
to
the
light
it
smells
of
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
does
mirror
the
smell
but
on
a
much
lighter
scale
and
likewise
the
weight
of
the
body
is
very
weak
especially
for
a
barleywine
buttery
aftertaste
probably
the
easiest
drinking
barleywine
ive
had
but
a
lightweight
all
around
overall
not
a
pleasant
experience
with
the
light
mouthfeel
and
one
note
taste
but
am
glad
to
have
tried
a
new
beer
and
like
other
rock
art
stuff
but
will
not
purchase
this
one
again
meh
not
horrible
but
its
a
mess
probably
one
of
the
most
underwhelming
barleywines
ive
had
the
taste
has
subtle
toasted
cracker
and
spice
with
the
diacetyl
pretty
dominant
the
flavor
of
the
malt
comes
and
goes
with
the
carbonation
washing
most
of
the
taste
clean
except
as
the
beer
is
swallowed
a
slightly
astringent
and
mildly
piney
hop
flavor
emerges
the
beer
is
neither
good
nor
bad
it
just
is
imo
the
problem
is
it
has
the
diacetyl
too
forward
and
there
is
not
enough
malt
with
the
yeast
and
hops
taking
over
the
flavor
i
would
not
buy
this
again
most
likely
as
it
lacks
a
good
malt
body
which
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
good
barleywine
o
have
had
some
pretty
good
beers
from
rock
art
but
this
one
was
a
bit
if
a
disappointment
tealike
brownish
red
in
color
with
good
clarity
poured
with
a
think
beige
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
thin
wisps
smooth
buttery
feel
with
light
lazy
carbonation
sweet
toasted
and
english
malt
and
toffee
aromas
with
a
hint
of
light
floral
hops
in
the
background
light
floral
english
hops
from
beginning
to
end
toasted
malt
and
toffee
flavors
similar
to
aromas
finished
semidry
with
a
lingering
floral
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
an
english
ale
without
a
doubt
probably
the
lightest
barleywine
ive
tried
but
was
good
nonetheless
o
a
little
bit
less
boozey
and
sweet
then
most
of
the
barleywines
ive
had
and
not
as
much
of
a
wine
taste
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
o
id
score
this
significantly
higher
if
it
were
called
a
brown
ale
an
amber
ale
or
maybe
even
a
scotch
ale
as
a
barleywine
though
its
an
utter
failure
dont
expect
this
beer
to
be
rich
sweet
hoppy
or
satisfying
in
the
least
note
to
rock
art
please
stop
getting
peoples
hopes
up
by
calling
this
a
barleywine
d
big
on
taste
rather
than
heft
it
has
enough
girth
but
is
a
rather
tasty
and
easy
drinking
barley
wine
almost
the
quaffing
version
at
the
lower
end
for
the
style
it
may
not
compare
to
apple
to
apples
with
some
of
the
monsters
out
there
however
as
a
milder
version
it
is
a
very
approachable
and
drinkable
brew
im
surprised
that
rock
art
could
pull
off
a
barley
wine
this
flavorful
with
such
a
low
abv
great
idea
way
to
think
outside
the
box
kind
of
boring
in
the
end
ive
had
this
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
and
i
dont
really
see
the
need
to
go
back
any
more
in
the
future
really
a
barleywine
thats
easy
to
drink
and
perhaps
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
but
certainly
not
emblematic
of
it
middling
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
many
times
in
the
past
good
availability
right
over
the
border
the
malt
profile
is
substantial
i
do
wish
there
was
more
interesting
hop
profile
in
this
beer
though
i
always
find
the
hops
bitter
not
pleasant
maybe
some
new
hop
selections
would
make
a
difference
here
aroma
is
light
hints
of
vanilla
light
leather
and
bourbon
are
the
most
pronounced
really
rich
smelling
and
the
alcohol
is
coming
through
clearly
evidence
of
the
malts
dominates
everything
this
is
a
good
thing
and
even
an
hour
into
this
bottle
that
sweet
vanilla
aroma
is
mixing
with
an
almost
toffee
like
touch
and
a
hint
of
plum
smooth
rich
flavor
washes
across
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
but
still
plenty
of
body
for
this
barleywine
smooth
with
a
slightly
warming
finish
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
certainly
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
hopforward
barelywines
that
seem
to
dominate
the
market
now
overall
while
this
does
not
resemble
a
barleywine
as
im
familiar
with
the
styleand
at
7
5
abv
is
one
of
the
weaker
of
the
lot
which
usually
run
812it
is
still
a
delicious
beer
having
excellent
flavors
that
are
well
balanced
and
finely
nuanced
many
of
the
low
scores
i
give
in
this
review
are
simply
a
result
of
the
brew
not
resembling
the
style
it
purports
to
be
and
thus
appearing
mislabeled
something
seems
strange
about
this
off
base
for
the
style
one
of
the
smaller
feeling
barleywines
i
have
come
across
but
no
real
off
flavors
or
major
flaws
it
has
a
nice
malt
profile
and
a
decent
yeast
compliment
certainly
worth
a
shot
in
a
mix
a
six
or
mixed
12
pack
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
notched
at
feb
pours
a
murky
dirty
copper
dark
red
color
with
a
very
small
head
zero
lacing
aroma
is
earthy
with
some
booze
dark
fruits
caramel
and
butter
taste
is
buttery
with
dark
fruit
flavor
slight
bitterness
to
it
along
with
some
breadiness
kind
of
tastes
like
the
caramel
popcorn
you
get
in
those
decorative
tins
during
xmas
its
nice
to
get
a
barleywine
in
a
mix
12
pack
but
this
one
is
just
alright
not
bad
but
its
no
very
boozey
for
a
barleywine
overall
it
fits
perfectly
in
this
pack
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
big
and
at
times
it
cant
hide
it
it
is
smooth
but
complex
and
seems
to
have
some
hidden
facets
to
it
as
you
go
along
for
the
ride
d
meh
this
is
a
pretty
weak
example
of
the
style
its
nice
to
see
an
english
barleywine
sold
in
a
six
pack
but
i
dont
think
this
is
what
i
wanted
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
one
out
again
its
like
a
light
barleywine
decent
in
its
own
right
drink
is
soso
not
much
by
way
of
booze
but
the
minerality
combined
with
the
herbal
hop
flavors
and
a
sticky
finish
give
it
a
bit
of
trouble
drinkability
is
low
on
this
one
goes
down
very
smooth
with
the
thinmedium
body
and
low
carbonation
but
the
flavors
really
arent
that
pleasant
this
beer
was
received
as
an
extra
from
shaggy9356
thanks
matt
it
poured
a
dark
burnt
stained
woodlike
amber
with
a
quickly
dissipating
off
white
head
it
smells
like
a
bland
macro
amber
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
which
beer
its
most
similar
to
but
it
may
be
along
the
lines
of
fat
tire
for
a
barleywine
this
tastes
nothing
like
it
its
very
malty
and
has
something
flat
going
on
it
has
a
strange
funkiness
to
it
its
not
only
not
impressive
its
pretty
bad
this
is
near
a
drain
pour
as
it
leaves
a
downright
odd
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
it
drinks
smoothly
enough
to
be
honest
though
im
having
a
tough
time
drinking
this
its
smooth
i
guess
but
its
other
lackings
are
so
distracting
at
least
i
got
to
try
it
comments
this
was
ok
but
a
bit
bland
for
a
barleywine
i
knoe
rock
arts
hands
are
a
bit
tied
with
vts
restriction
on
abv
i
think
8
is
the
max
in
beer
that
would
certainly
limit
their
potential
but
i
would
not
have
produced
this
if
in
such
circumstances
a
barelywine
is
usually
more
fuller
flavored
bodied
that
this
this
is
ok
but
closer
to
a
ridge
runs
into
a
dark
bronze
kinda
brownish
kinda
orangered
in
color
with
a
head
if
you
can
call
it
that
nothing
left
on
the
glass
this
does
look
barleywine
esque
but
the
lack
of
head
on
a
seven
point
fiver
baffles
me
smells
include
mmmaaalllttt
alot
of
malt
caramel
toffee
but
some
piney
hops
from
the
fresh
botle
faint
dark
fruit
that
about
sums
it
up
taste
include
caramel
slight
sugar
coconut
dark
fruit
earthy
hops
toast
yep
feel
is
mediumish
with
low
carb
kinda
deadish
but
ah
well
i
drank
it
i
thanked
it
i
super
ranked
it
good
for
a
gander
drinkability
is
another
high
point
for
this
beer
while
it
is
on
the
low
side
for
the
style
alcoholwise
it
is
also
an
easy
drinker
very
good
dollop
of
hops
to
the
otherwise
malty
and
mildly
sweet
beer
low
alcohol
presence
for
the
style
accurate
body
and
carbonation
o
enjoyed
it
but
not
blown
away
goes
down
ok
kinda
weak
in
flavor
and
body
but
its
not
gross
just
kind
of
bland
d
a
decent
barleywine
very
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
maybe
because
it
is
english
style
it
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
am
used
to
in
the
barleywine
this
is
a
technicality
i
am
uncertain
of
i
have
had
other
barleywines
which
i
think
were
american
and
they
were
much
stronger
i
think
the
toned
down
version
is
ok
but
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
flavor
very
malty
thick
pours
almost
like
a
dark
red
ale
some
hop
presence
goes
down
relatively
smooth
id
get
this
again
not
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
though
id
like
to
try
the
vermontster
d
at
7
5
this
is
too
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
that
is
the
only
thing
to
keep
me
from
knocking
back
one
after
the
other
pours
an
amber
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
off
white
head
which
becomes
thin
lacing
dark
fruits
and
rich
malts
carry
through
the
aroma
a
faint
existence
of
grassy
hops
is
present
this
has
very
earthy
flavors
with
a
touch
of
bitter
coffee
and
tart
cherries
in
flavor
grassy
hops
linger
on
the
tongue
this
isnt
as
heavy
as
i
would
generally
expect
from
the
style
at
7
5
this
goes
down
pretty
easy
this
is
decent
but
i
feel
like
i
can
get
better
for
the
style
just
as
easy
and
about
the
same
price
pour
is
a
crimson
amber
decent
enough
head
weird
darkmalt
nose
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
a
bit
thin
an
there
is
something
off
very
strong
coffee
tastearoma
throughout
it
just
isnt
very
good
and
it
isnt
worth
going
into
detail
about
it
too
much
wrong
here
i
poured
it
out
and
moved
on
skip
this
if
you
see
it
md
thick
but
not
from
malt
kind
of
a
sticky
viscous
mouthfeel
dry
finish
appropriate
carbonation
tiny
bit
of
etoh

an
amberish
brown
color
with
cream
colore
dhead
minimal
retention
but
ok
lacing
smell
is
forward
of
semisweet
carmely
malts
decent

background
taste
is
of
semisweet
carmely
malts
some
earthy
nuttyness
to
it
decent
sized
punch
of
hops
for
the
style
with
a
lingering
touch
of
booze
medium
bodied
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
fairly
smooth
not
sure
whats
going
on
here
but
lacks
much
of
the
charachter
of
a
traditional
barleywine
most
of
my
review
notes
lead
more
towards
an
amber
or
lager
decent
beer
yes
but
out
of
style
quite
disappointing
it
seems
that
someone
skimped
on
the
ingredients
does
not
taste
bad
it
just
lacks
flavor
brownishamber
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
cocoa
and
caramel
taste
is
toffee
and
caramel
malts
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
pretty
weak
and
boring
i
dont
think
there
is
anything
awful
about
this
beer
but
its
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
any
time
soon
drinkability
this
is
my
new
favorite
in
this
style
i
like
the
maltiness
this
has
touches
of
a
good
porter
and
wee
heavy
the
taste
is
complexand
is
about
as
sessionable
as
a
barleywine
can
be
my
favorite
from
rock
art
pours
a
brownish
garnet

the
slightest

background
some

sweetness
midpalate

cookie
dough
near
the
finish
mildly
bitter
herbal
hop
flavors
provide
some
balance
but
this
is
definitely
on
the
maltier
side
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
perhaps
a
bit
weak
and
thin
for
the
style
still
not
bad
and
pretty
drinkable
taste
is
a
perfect
combination
of
sweet
bitter
and
smooth
its
really
drinkable
and
and
awesome
somewhat
tame
barleywine
its
a
good
gateway
to
bigger
beers
like
the
vermonster
flavor
matches
the
aroma
closely
but
i
was
honestly
expecting
more
of
a
maltbomb
instead
im
greeted
with
a
slightly
overcarbonated
thinbodied
barleywine
that
despite
packing
a
nice
woodenpiny
hop
bite
on
the
finish
has
a
thinlyveiled
malty
sweetness
that
suggests
sugarfree
toffee
slight
improvement
as
ridge
runner
warms
but
it
is
too
little
too
late
thin
for
the
style
bubbly
mouthfeel
with
a
drying
finish
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
but
itll
do
in
a
pinch
drinkability
not
undrinkable
but
why
waste
the
time
this
is
the
most
insipid
barleywine
i
have
encountered
dont
drink
and
review
d
too
sweet
and
potent
for
me
to
session
but
it
was
nice
to
start
the
night
off
with
i
think
ill
have
another
sip
or
two
or
four
oops
its
gone
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
reddish
highlights
a
nice
frothy
head
sits
on
top
of
the
liquid
nice
aroma
on
this
one
lots
of
roasted
and
nutty
characteristics
a
little
wood
toasted
and
dark
malts
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
some
wet
earth
not
bad
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
after
the
smell
its
modestly
sweet
and
very
restrained
its
reasonably
good
but
it
lacks
a
fullness
and
intense
barleywinestyle
taste
a
little
grainy
and
hollow
lighter
than
it
should
be
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
not
a
great
barleywine
ridge
runner
is
easy
to
consume
and
more
fitting
to
an
afternoon
with
friends
than
what
i
am
seeking
in
a
barleywine
to
me
this
more
closely
resembles
a
trickedout
brown
ale
and
is
still
enjoyable
just
not
what
i
was
looking
for
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
barleywine
i
could
easily
drink
a
second
one
of
these
thanks
to
brothercannon
for
this
bottle
poured
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
ridge
runner
appears
a
clear
amber

color

about
a

thanks
again
tim
the
beer
poured
out
of
the
bottle
to
reveal
a
deep
amber
almost
mohogany
color
the
aroma
was
nice
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
apricot
the
first
taste
was
malty
and
mildly
fruity
but
that
gives
way
to
a
mild
hop
bitterness
as
the
beer
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
finishes
with
a
mild
bitterness
to
make
you
want
another
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
nature
and
what
you
would
expect
from
the
style
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
light
brown
hue
thick
and
rocky
light
tan
head
forms
drops
a
pretty
solid
amount
of
lace
on
its
way
down
good
retention
smell
is
nice
caramel
and
raisins
lightly
fruity
biscuit
and
toast
some
citrusorange
peel
hopping
nice
and
malty
if
a
little
basic
taste
is
similar
lots
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
biscuits
raisins
very
fruity
strawberries
and
melon
spicy
bitterness
and
orange
peel
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
pretty
decent
stuff
i
like
it
smooth
going
down
and
some
nice
flavours
very
drinkable
thanks
kyle
d
easy
enough
but
would
tire
of
the
taste
after
a
few
22oz
bomber
this
one
poured
an
opaque
caramel
color
there
was
a
small
tan
head
on
it
that
dropped
away
immediately
im
surprised
that
a
barley
wine
is
only
7
5
abv
i
guess
that
explains
the
lighter
aroma
some
caramel
malt
fruits
and
surprisingly
alcohol
to
the
nose
definitely
thin
on
the
tongue
for
a
barley
wine
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
the
taste
followed
by
some
dryness
a
bit
smoky
and
roasty
up
front
followed
by
some
caramel
and
dark
fruits
not
bad
but
not
what
id
consider
a
barley
wine
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
that
reduced
to
an
even
thinner
ring
around
that
hugged
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
fruit
toffee
with
a
little
bit
hops
in
the
background
the
palate
is
light
for
a
barley
wine
with
some
carbonation
sweet
but
snappy
in
the
flavor
similar
to
the
aroma
it
finishes
with
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
which
provides
some
balance
a
nice
little
barleywine
but
perhaps
a
little
light
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
not
too
bad
although
i
dont
understand
the
need
for
such
a
light
overall
beer
thats
a
choice
rock
art
made
with
the
ridge
runner
and
thats
okay
but
i
much
prefer
the
vermonster
with
its
fiery
alpha
acids
and
big
caramel
sweetness
ashy
and
smooth
both
a
bit
dryashy
for
style
though
a
deep
rich
dry
and
bitter
barleywine
ale
coffee
grape
tobacco
one
of
my
favorite
out
of
the
mix
pack
and
a
musttry
from
this
brewery
that
said
look
to
outher
examples
of
the
style
to
be
blown
away
but
stick
with
this
one
of
you
want
to
pass
the
time
with
a
higher
abv
palatable
winter
ale
d
not
bad
just
bland
i
did
like
vermonster
though
this
is
a
great
barleywine
ale
style
more
importantly
its
a
full
flavored
brew
that
i
will
definitely
try
again
when
given
the
opportunity
much
less
hoppy
then
most
barleywines
i
have
tried
recently
flavors
dominated
by
malt
and
fruit
sweet
but
not
cloying
in
the
yeast
negligible
alcohol
aromataste
dark
for
a
barleywine
and
somewhat
cloudy
very
subdued
and
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
perfect
at
first
but
starts
to
get
just
the
slightest
bit
too
watery
near
the
end
if
it
was
labled
as
an
american
amber
or
red
ale
it
might
get
better
reviews
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
thin
head
aroma
of
malts
hops
and
alcohol
but
all
less
prominent
than
in
your
average
barley
wine
flavor
again
is
similar
to
a
barleywine
yet
much
weaker
niot
a
strong
alcohol
presence
with
more
of
a
malty
taste
dissapointing
totaly
drinkable
have
had
many
nights
with
this
one
and
one
drunken
wedding
as
well
d
goes
down
pretty
smooth
all
over
flavorful
tasty
a
person
trying
to
get
into
barleywines
would
benefit
from
trying
this
i
didnt
detect
any
hops
taste
at
all
in
this
one
which
made
me
think
it
is
more
of
a
stout
very
low
carbonation
and
not
much
for
flavortaste
but
it
is
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
just
a
little
boring
as
it
goes
down
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
dirty
white
and
rocky
head
nose
was
molasses
brown
sugar
and
some
fruits
taste
was
rather
bland
and
weak
for
bwine
i
was
expecting
more
hops
and
more
malts
taste
was
ok
but
it
just
tasted
rather
weak
not
bad
but
not
what
i
expected
from
an
english
bwine
mouthfeel
was
nice
easy
drinkig
a
little
bitter
at
times
drinkability
is
average
there
are
many
bwines
out
there
who
provide
stiff
competetion
though
good
it
was
not
special
i
believe
with
some
age
this
will
fill
out
lucky
me
for
getting
2
bottles
very
drinkable
maybe
because
its
quite
dry
for
a
barley
wine
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
sweet
with
loads
of
overcooked
vegetables
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
overcooked
vegetables
with
some
oversweet
malt
body
is
really
thin
with
some
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
thought
there
was
way
too
many
brewing
flaws
in
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
off
white
almost
tan
head
the
thin
miniscus
of
lace
persists
with
a
lot
of
malt
aroma
floating
above
it
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
background
but
it
smells
like
a
good
english
barley
wine
to
me
the
taste
follows
suite
with
a
lot
of
roasted
barley
taste
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
hop
finish
but
the
malt
and
alcohol
dont
really
say
barleywine
to
me
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
combined
with
the
low
alcohol
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
single
12oz
bottle
consumed

purchased
back
in

08
i
think
it
was
from
charles
street
liquors
in
boston
they
are
known
to
have
some
pretty
old
stock
sometimes
and
this
one
is
difficult
to
place
the
side
label
has
a
notch
beside
march
but
no
year
listed
so
with
that
out
of
the
way
what
do
we
have
here
we
have
a
very
dark
brown
pour
with
little
head
pretty
nice
aroma
a
little
sweet
and
im
oddly
getting
some
coffee
notes
first
taste
follows
the
nose
and
its
pretty
good
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
certainly
not
too
sweet
as
i
find
some
barleywines
and
theres
certainly
a
lot
of
roasty
coffee
flavours
here
im
no
barleywine
expert
but
i
wasnt
expecting
that
from
the
style
this
is
more
along
the
lines
of
a
stout
in
my
opinion
which
is
just
fine
for
me
since
there
are
a
lot
of
barleywines
that
are
not
to
my
liking
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
pretty
good
sweet
barley
aroma
dark
woodstain
color
decent
head
but
no
lacing
lightly
carbonated
and
smooth
deceptive
a
lot
more
potent

this
is
a
nice
flavorful
end
to
the
sampler
the
most
intriguing
of
the
mix
d
a
nice
change
but
not
a
goto
for
me
packaging
a
nice
earthy
looking
label
the
kokopeli
and
the
large
vermont
on
the
label
gave
me
a
good
idea
of
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
what
are
they
marketing
a
place
or
a
brew
first
thing
i
noticed
about
this
beer
was
its
intense
smell
clean
grapes
grain
dates
and
nuts
pours
with
a
1
5
finger
light
amber
head
color
is
a
sedimentfree
dark
amberbrown
the
higher
7

content
is
well
hidden
by
tangy
yeast
bitter
fruit
and
a
light
coffee
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
sub
par
too
watery
for
my
tastes
although
this
brew
isnt
too
heavy
its
flavor
may
be
strong
enough
to
discourage
backtoback
bottles
for
some
this
is
a
clear
but
very
dark
mahogany
colored
barleywine
with
a
medium
sized
offwhite
head
and
lots
of
lace
a
nice
aroma
combining
raisin
licorice
and
chocolate
very
palatable
a
fizzy
somewhat
thin
brew
but
the
flavor
brings
out
some
charcoal
and
more
raisinlicorice
there
is
an
orange
citrus
hint
that
holds
on
your
tongue
pretty
drinkable
not
too
strong
but
maybe
a
little
too
thin
bodied
overall
a
good
brew
pours
a
dark
copper
color
shades
of
brown
and
red
massive
carbonation
but
not
much
head
at
all
smell
is
light
but
not
too
offensive
softly
sweet
of
caramel
and
fruit
with
bready
doughy
undertones
taste
is
kind
of
bland
sweet
bready
hints
of
chocolate
light
hop
presence
no
alcohol
noted
but
watery
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
but
super
thin
not
a
favorite
semi
sweet
roasted
malt
are
not
real
complex
some
bitterness
lets
you
know
the
hops
are
there
but
not
in
a
fresh
flavor
a
bit
metallic
tasting
in
the
aftertaste
the
alcohol
makes
itself
known
but
not
over
powering
overall
this
is
drinkable
but
not
fulfilling
like
a
barley
wine
should
be
not
a
strong
malt
profile
to
speak
of
and
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
bit
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
but
nicely
carbonated
somewhat
drinkable
a
good
sipping
beer
but
i
think
there
are
better
representations
of
barleywines
drinkability
this
is
a
3bottle
beer
for
the
most
part
good
for
drinking
with
good
vry
good
but
more
like
a
treat
than
other
lighter
beers
d
a
very
easy
drinking
barley
wine
i
would
compare
this
to
middle
ages
druid
fluid
a
very
good
ebw
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
musty
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
that
also
has
a
mild
hop
bitterness
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
grainy
pale
and
roasted
malt
flavor
its
got
a
smokey
offflavor
to
it
as
well
its
a
struggle
to
put
down
the
mouthfeel
is
average
as
well
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
co2
its
quite
thin
for
a
barleywine
this
is
a
forgettable
beer
for
sure
its
got
to
be
my
least
favorite
of
this
style
its
one
and
done
for
me
medium
bodied
but
creamy
mouthfeel
midlevel
of
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
doesnt
come
across
as
barleywine
to
me
maybe
more
like
a
kickedup
chocolaty
brown
ale
but
good
nonetheless
i
think
the
hops
have
really
faded
from
this
but
have
allowed
a
good
basemalt
bill
to
come
through
certainly
an
interesting
barleywine
at
first
it
comes
off
like
a
really
big
or
double
esb
as
it
has
very
bready
and
biscuity
malt
flavors
as
opposed
to
the
more
traditional
big
fruity
malt
the
balance
also
clearly
tips
toward
the
big
grassy
earthy
hops
here
making
it
feel
more
american
in
bitterness
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
at
times
the
hops
do
a
good
job
of
keeping
the
drinkability
up
in
a
nice
hoppy
way
worth
a
try
if
you
like
esbs
big
english
hops
and
something
different
for
a
barleywine
on
a
side
note
this
seems
much
better
when
aged
when
fresh
it
doesnt
have
much
characther
unless
youre
able
to
find
it
on
cask
somewhere
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
after
those
massive
powder
skiing
days
the
7
5
alcohol
and
high
drinkability
helps
forget
the
sore
knees
d
i
find
barleywines
to
be
hit
or
miss
with
me
and
this
one
borders
on
a
miss
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
counter
the
bitter
and
smokey
aspects
and
perhaps
a
thicker
beefier
body
i
havent
seen
too
many
rock
art
beers
outside
of
vermont
so
i
was
excited
to
score
this
barleywine
in
a
mix
pack
i
found
at
a
new
store
in
plymouthma
not
a
real
strong
barleywine
as
far
as
alcohol
but
great
taste
and
afforability
make
up
for
it
i
have
been
impressed
with
all
rock
art
products
final
note
this
is
an
all
around
good
brew
anyone
who
appreciates
a
good
english
ale
should
like
this
barleywine
easily
drinkable
for
the
style
but
could
be
crafted
a
bit
better
in
my
mind
a
lot
of
people
seem
to
think
this
is
not
a
true
barleywine
and
i
tend
to
agree
with
that
ill
call
it
a
hybrid
i
think
7
5
abv
is
still
in
the
beer
range
but
its
pretty
close
to
me
a
barleywine
is
a
drink
that
must
be
sipped
as
they
are
supposed
to
be
more
intense
and
unsmooth
by
nature
this
doesnt
quite
have
the
thinkness
of
a
true
barleywine
that
being
said
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
goes
down
much
smoother
than
a
7
5
beer
should
and
its
a
good
thing
theres
only
three
of
these
in
the
sampler
pack
i
bought
because
this
stuff
could
get
me
into
real
trouble
real
quick
it
is
a
beautifully
balanced
brew
that
has
a
sharp
start
and
a
subtle
finish
its
amazing
how
this
beer
seems
to
magically
change
in
your
mouth
going
from
sharp
and
bitter
to
mellow
and
smooth
in
a
matter
of
seconds
pours
a
four
finger
offwhite
head
that
goes
slowly
and
leaves
some
lace
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
deep
mahogany
color
nose
is
earthy
flavor
is
balanced
some
sweetness
with
bitter
coffee
lingering
bitter
finish
different
from
the
usual
barleywine
and
abv
is
low
for
a
barleywine
dont
buy
this
expecting
something
like
mirror
mirror
as
a
previous
rater
put
it
easily
drinkable
yet
easily
forgettable
1
75
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
i
would
say
that
this
ia
a
pretty
complex
ale
for
me
to
describe
perhaps
with
some
aging
the
flavors
might
mellow
more
the
alcohol
is
deceptively
hidden
though
i
can
see
why
its
so
popular
with
some
of
my
friends
pours
a
red
hued
brown
with
a
pillowy
head
looks
really
nice
the
smell
is
subtle
citrus
and
earthy
notes
not
really
in
your
face
tastes
of
mellow
citrus
and
slight
caramel
sweetness
balanced
but
almost
not
enough
it
seems
like
everyhting
needs
to
be
kicked
up
more
flavor
in
general
i
can
appreciate
the
subtleness
and
the
balance
in
terms
of
the
alcohol
but
all
in
all
not
exactly
what
im
looking
for
from
a
barleywine
i
still
havent
decided
whether
i
prefer
the
english
or
american
style
barley
wines
but
this
was
certainly
a
pleasant
change
from
my
usual
summer
lineup
nonetheless
i
liked
the
frothy
brownish
head
on
this
beer
and
the
lacing
and
from
there
it
went
down
hill
this
beer
is
not
a
barley
wine
by
any
stretch
although
the
deep
amber
color
is
about
right
it
is
far
too
carbonated
too
medium
bodied
not
nearly
syrupy
enough
liqueur
consistency
is
what
i
was
expecting
too
yeasty
and
too
much
like
a
coffee
or
molasses
flavored
ale
for
this
to
even
get
in
the
vicinity
of
a
barley
wine
there
is
a
strong
coffee
burnt
dark
maltiness
to
this
beer
which
isnt
bad
but
im
still
stuck
on
the
misnomer
of
a
label
there
is
also
a
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
that
hinges
on
bitter
chocolate
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
of
my
least
favorite
out
of
the
variety
pack
22oz
bomber
love
the
kokopelli
character
on
the
label
art
dark
brown
with
persistent
head
and
lace
very
slight
fruit
cake
fruitiness
in
the
nose
as
well
as
baked
beans
and
molasses
no
traditional
high
alcohol
barleywine
aromas
tastes
of
a
strong
brown
ale
bitter
chocolate
burnt
caramel
molasses
and
brown
sugar
also
prune
and
fig
fruitiness
great
for
sipping
mildly
creamy
mouthfeel
not
quite
a
barleywine
as
its
not
brewed
to
style
but
its
very
drinkable
and
delicious
extremely
drinkable
for
7
5
beer
great
beer
thin
watery
body
with
not
enough
carbonation
off
dark
fruit
flavors
fig
overripe
plum
and
subtle
notes
of
caramel
this
is
another
mess
from
rock
art
with
no
coherency
between
the
flavors
not
bad
but
if
this
stood
toetotoe
with
any
other
beer
in
the
style
it
would
get
smacked
silly
ive
seen
this
priced
at
9
99bottle
and
i
cant
express
how
happy
i
was
to
have
only
paid
3
25
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
mouthfeel
is
almost
watery
and
thin
not
really
what
you
would
expect
with
a
barleywine
it
is
drinkable
but
not
very
interesting
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
sounds
like
rock
art
is
limited
to
a
8
abv
content
because
of
vermonts
laws
ok
not
all
barelywines
need
to
be
a
hefty
12
but
if
i
were
given
this
without
knowledge
of
it
being
called
a
barelywine
id
never
even
guess
this
would
be
classified
as
it
is
terrible
for
the
style
but
its
actually
a
decent
beer
comments
this
was
ok
but
a
bit
bland
for
a
barleywine
i
knoe
rock
arts
hands
are
a
bit
tied
with
vts
restriction
on
abv
i
think
8
is
the
max
in
beer
that
would
certainly
limit
their
potential
but
i
would
not
have
produced
this
if
in
such
circumstances
a
barelywine
is
usually
more
fuller
flavored
bodied
that
this
this
is
ok
but
closer
to
a
brown
ale
or
alt
cheers
i
really
like
the
water
theyve
used
but
unfortunately
thats
what
i
taste
the
most
of
a
very
quiet
7
with
very
low
bitterness
it
wasnt
all
bad
i
did
enjoy
it
make
no
mistake
about
it
but
this
is
what
id
expect
if
ab
or
coors
put
out
a
barleywine
wow
i
called
matt
about
this
one
to
find
out
how
long
it
might
have
been
awiting
consumption
based
on
the
notching
july
of
2004
when
i
was
attending
the
vermont
brewers
festival
now
2
12
years
later
how
would
it
fare
it
began
with
two
fingers
of
mochatan
head
that
reduced
to
cloudiness
but
not
wispiness
nose
had
a
mild
smokiness
to
it
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
gorgeous
ruby
highlights
as
well
as
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
full
and
soft
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
presnt
on
the
tongue
matt
had
told
me
that
this
was
intended
to
be
an
englishstyle
barleywine
and
indeed
the
malt
and
the
hops
were
somewhat
subdued
on
the
tongue
the
best
part
was
the
finish
which
left
an
aftertaste
of
malted
cocoa
like
you
might
get
from
quik
or
pdq
it
had
a
slightly
burnt
quality
to
it
but
in
the
best
way
man
if
this
is
what
english
barleywines
are
all
about
i
may
make
them
a
routine
stop
drinkability
is
good
its
nice
and
smooth
with
no
noticeable
alcohol
but
its
just
not
a
barleywine
to
me
if
you
called
this
an
english
brown
ale
id
think
its
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
a
barleywine
it
is
not

is
what
youd
get

a
few
weeks
after
youve
stoppered
the
bottle
and
return
to
find
something
quite
flavorful
serving
type
bottle
overall
not
exactly
the
style
i
am
use
to
but
not
saying
it
is
bad
just
unique
by
using
different
malts
or
different
amount
of
certain
malts
i
believe
this
beer
could
be
aged
due
to
the
higher
amount
of
carbonation
and
to
settle
down
some
attributes
to
the
beer

bought

thick

appearance
with
some
hints
of
red
in
the
light
thick
head
when
poured
but
it
dissipated
eventually
leaving
some
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
aromas
are
very
sweet
with
distinct
flavors
of
malts
dried
fruit
like
raisins
nuts
toffee
and
alcohol
the
drink
definitely
had
a
sugaryfruit
taste
mixed
with
toffee
leading
to
a
bittersweet
drink
with
a
sharp
bite
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
good
carbonation
and
helps
to
give
the
drink
a
crisp

this
might
be
my
new
favorite
barleywine
im
pretty
new
to
the
style
but
this
one
wowed
me
very
complex
flavor
of
dark
chocolates
and
fruits
and
wanders
in
to
the
belgian
strong
dark
category
of
flavor
the
aroma
and
texture
complimented
the
flavor
quite
well
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
let
this
one
sit
awhile
to
warm
and
open
up
for
a
strong
but
well
balanced
barley
wine
overall
my
favorite
offering
from
pretty
things
trumps
baby
tree
quad
field
mouse
farewell
and
barbapapa
an
allstar
offering
for
sure
the
flavor
follows
with
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
but
again
with
that
licorice
and
bitter
spice
sweetness
throughout
with
a
touch
of
toasted
malt
and
chocolate
on
the
back
end
pours
a
syrupy
brown
with
active
bubbles
and
thin
sticky
head
brown
sugar
and
molasses
subtle
cherry
plum
dried
fruit
on
the
nose
not
as
strong
in
malt
aroma
or
taste
as
i
expected
dominant
flavor
is
brown
sugar
some
nutty
flavors
maybe
a
bit
of
a
cherry
cola
flavor
boozy
but
deceptively
easy
drinking
for
a
high
alcohol
beer
definitely
leaves
sugary
residue
on
your
lips
kinda
let
me
down
in
the
flavor
category
a
subtle
malty
taste
that
was
not
as
desirable
as
other
barlywines
overall
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
not
something
i
would
go
hunting
for
theres
a
lot
better
out
there
but
you
would
need
to
really
hunt
if
this
one
comes
along
before
hand
grab
it
it
wont
disappoint
but
i
am
not
going
to
overhype
something
to
just
let
you
down
this
beer
is
drank
from
a
bottle
and
has
a
pour
of
hazy
brown
and
beige
the
style
is
barley
wine
the
aroma
has
a
roasted
malt
caramel
and
toffee
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
alcohol
and
caramel
also
come
into
play
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
too
sweet
for
anything
besides
a
small
serving
size
even
then
im
not
sure
about
it
the
medicinal
flavor
doesnt
really
overwhelm
but
it
isnt
pleasant
deep
amber
in
color
with
dark
blood
orange
hue
and
a
dense
haze
poured
with
a
thick
dense
tawny
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
full
bodied
with
a
thick
oily
feel
up
front
and
light
tight
smooth
carbonation
through
the
middle
to
the
end
sweet
toffee
toasted
and
caramel
malt
aromas
with
earthy
hop
notes
and
unmistakable
booziness
huge
toasted
and
caramel
malty
flavor
up
front
followed
by
subdued
hop
spiciness
through
the
middle
hop
presence
fades
toward
the
end
as
the
sticky
maltiness
takes
over
once
again
finished
dryly
with
a
candy
toffee
and
strong
boozy
aftertaste
pours
a
deep
amber
thin
head
that
lingers

like

a
bit

taste
is
similar

could

this
with

update
tried
the
nov
2011
bottling
again
after
cellaring
for
over
two
years
indeed
cellaring
has
mellowed
this
beast
out
and
it
is
now
extremely
smooth
fruity
and
delicious
unquestionably
a
barley
wine
and
a
great
one
at
that
immediately
upon
opening
the
bottle
the
aroma
smacked
me
in
the
face
with
an
entire
fruit
cake
raisins
and
plums
but
also
overripe
pears
apricots
dates
and
a
hint
of
treacle
heavy
as
fuck
but
mellowed
the
fuck
out
o
a
nice
and
complex
english
barleywine
the
yeast
definitely
imparts
the
english
part
way
too
easy
to
drink
for
13
5
although
its
hard
to
do
more
than
just
sip
slowly
great
price
point
definitely
has
some
aging
potential
as
well
overall
a
real
solid
and
impressive
barleywine
great
barleywine
find
indeed
taste
was
great
sweat
and
and
malty
maybe
too
much
spice
probably
should
have
used
just
on
mulling
pack
overall
a
great
experience
though
will
try
again
later
in
the
season
22
ounce
bottle
no
date
on
it
so
i
have
no
idea
what
vintage
this
is
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
light
tan
head
the
head
sticks
around
a
little
while
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
dark
fruit
caramel
apples
dark
bread
and
some
booze
it
tastes
like
caramel
toffee
dark
bread
dark
fruit
wood
and
some
brandy
its
a
nice
sweet
malty
brew
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
a
bit
slick
and
has
moderate
carbonation
i
like
this
brew
a
lot
but
then
ive
liked
everything
ive
tried
from
pretty
things
so
far
10

a
bottle
oooh
wow
a
barn
burner
at
13
5
abv
really
nice
tasty
sweet
syrupy
alcoholy
nice
to
look
at
nice
to
think
about
just
dont
drink
it
quickly
despite
my
high
impression
of
this
beer
for
me
it
is
a
onetime
only
beer
given
its
high
abv
nonetheless
i
will
gladly
taste
it
again
at
the
brewery
or
at
a
fest
thank
you
to
dann
and
the
pretty
things
team
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
sticky
sweet
and
very
boozy
for
a
fairly
big
brew
it
is
sadly
lacking
in
complexity
and
still
very
alcohol
forward
for
being
cellared
for
2
years
i
would
probably
avoid
purchasing
this
again
o
definitely
a
beer
meant
for
sharing
and
this
one
lets
the
malts
do
all
the
talking
not
even
a
whisper
of
hop
bitterness
very
smooth
and
well
rounded
and
for
being
13
5
the
alcohol
is
hidden
surprisingly
well
overall
i
like
to
put
a
little
age
on
my
barleywines
so
cellaring
this
one
for
1
12
years
certainly
softened
the
rough
edges
and
allowed
the
complexity
to
develop
another
fine
beer
from
the
paquettes
my
first
real
foray
into
barley
wines
absolutely
delicious
pretty
little
things
nailed
it
my
pour
was
dark
and
fluid
when
i
drank
it
i
had
the
warm
sensation
of
wine
in
my
chest
but
had
the
taste
of
a
delicious
brew
im
just
going
to
say
get
this
one
while
you
can
o
seriously
sweet
enjoyable
ebw
the
malt
profile
balances
some
of
the
sweetness
as
usual
for
pt
this
beer
has
its
own
unique
twists
that
keep
it
from
being
just
any
ole
ebw
reviewed
from
notes
pours
a
deep
auburncrimson
with
nice
clarity
and
minimal
head
the
smell
has
waves
of
raisin
caramel
maple
and
some
mild
hop
character
the
taste
is
malt
forward
with
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
and
a
great
balance
robust
favors
with
touches
of
dark
fruit
toffee
honey
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
barleywine
ith
delicate
flavored
that
work
quite
well
pretty
decent
english
barleywine
probably
wont
grab
another
but
was
very
worth
trying
o
this
is
a
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
character
trouble
is
my
tastes
dont
agree
with
any
of
that
character
this
tastes
more
like
medicine
than
beer
to
me
making
it
a
struggle
to
get
through
a
glass
and
thats
certainly
not
something
i
treasure
overall
its
complexities
were
not
lost
on
me
though
i
still
couldnt
enjoy
it
if
you
really
enjoy
barleywines
or
licorice
this
may
be
right
up
your
alley
o
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
need
to
have
one
fresh
for
comparison
of
course
will
definitely
pick
up
another
bottle
next
time
im
back
east
a
great
beer
for
the
winter
the
nose
is
an
absolute
winner
this
is
a
beer
i
could
sit
around
smelling
all
day
the
beer
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
wispy
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
bounds
with
sweet
sugar
the
palate
brings
a
combination
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
even
hints
of
chocolate
it
hits
the
right
tones
as
it
move
across
the
palate
and
signs
off
without
much
bitterness
as
a
good
barleywine
should
the
alcohol
definitely
makes
it
presence
known
but
not
in
a
way
that
is
objectionable
good
stuff
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
brings
a
lot
to
the
table
a
nice
complex
non
barrel
aged
barleywine
this
drinks
quite
well
despite
being
bottled
in
the
last
few
months
id
like
to
get
my
hands
on
an
older
bottle
as
it
would
probably
be
incredible
nonetheless
this
is
a
great
brew
and
i
will
most
likely
be
buying
this
at
least
twice
a
year
lastly
this
is
my
first
brew
by
pretty
things
and
i
am
extremely
satisfied
awesome
job
served
properly
into
a
pt
ofr
stem
glass
a
deep
garnet
brown
color
not
quite
opaque
very
effervescent
and
topped
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
that
stayed
small
but
retained
forever
and
left
streaks
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
was
malty
nutty
caramel
and
slightly
woody
taste
was
similar
bready
nutty
toasted
grains
caramel
malts
hints
of
old
raisins
brown
sugar
herbal
hops
and
a
stiff
woody
finish
booze
was
felt
but
pretty
wellhidden
tastewise
body
was
medium
smooth
mouthfeel
even
if
slightly
higher
in
carbonation
that
id
have
expected
careful
pouring
its
very
yeasty
towards
the
bottom
and
i
could
swear
the
yeast
was
actually
still
active
nice
beer
overall
best
thing
my
friend
smiled
and
i
think
hes
planning
on
bringing
me
more
beer
overall
a
complex
barleywine
with
lots
of
fruit
flavours
that
i
personally
didnt
dig
in
a
big
way
pretty
boozy
still
too
maybe
not
bad
just
not
my
thing
overall
although
its
another
nice
beer
from
pretty
things
id
like
to
have
another
bottle
to
see
how
it
might
improve
from
cellaring
for
a
year
or
two
o
another
great
beer
from
pretty
things
i
will
look
for
a
few
more
bottles
to
store
and
enjoy
over
the
next
few
years
dont
pass
it
up
and
let
it
breathe
for
20mins
i
did
not
and
sadly
it
cost
an
excellent
review
recommended
o
our
finest
regards
comes
off
a
little
like
hair
of
the
dogs
beers
and
both
breweries
are
interested
in
historical
styles
its
a
really
unique
buzzworthy
beer
and
ideal
for
winter
i
braved
the
whole
bomber
but
it
took
three
hours
maybe
im
superimposing
but
i
think
this
beer
genuinely
succeeds
at
capturing
a
time
of
year
and
a
feeling
when
it
hits
the
shelves
my
caveman
self
prepares
to
trundle
into
the
winter
lair
pop
open
a
bottle
with
some
caveman
friends
and
hunker
down
and
i
dont
mean
to
suggest
that
this
beer
has
neanderthal
qualities
its
very
refined
but
it
does
tap
into
the
part
of
my
lizard
brain
than
wants
delicious
boozy
drinks
shared
with
good
friends
on
chilly
nights
well
i
cant
say
this
one
isnt
complex
im
not
sure
ive
ever
really
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
one
before
which
is
something
i
cant
say
often
im
not
entirely
sure
i
love
the
entire
flavor
profile
but
the
overall
was
more
enjoyable
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
had
a
few
too
much
belgian
character
for
my
taste
buds
but
glad
i
got
to
try
it
nonetheless
our
finest
regards
does
all
that
american
barleywines
are
asked
to
do
its
enormous
taste
is
balanced
complex
and
robust
it
does
all
this
without
a
hint
of
roughness
bite
or
harsh
textures
even
though
the
label
portrays
a
kind
beer
built
for
drinking
remember
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
o
a
bit
sweet
but
not
over
done
smooth
powerful
but
well
hidden
alcohol
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
brown
sugar
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
finish
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
pretty
strong
overall
this
is
one
of
the
finest
barleywines
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
try
and
a
welcome
break
from
many
of
its
peers
which
come
across
as
overly
sweet
and
alcoholic
here
the
sweetness
is
tempered
wonderfully
by
bitterness
and
ash
and
the
high
13
5
abv
goes
largely
unnoticed
in
taste
making
itself
known
mainly
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
as
in
a
continuous
burning
on
the
tongue
and
soft
palate
fantastic
brew
would
drink
this
regularly
o
this
is
a
powerful
and
smooth
barleywine
and
damn
delicious
i
shudder
to
think
what
a
solid
812
months
in
a
bourbon
barrel
could
do
to
this
thing
taste
has
a
great
caramel
toffee
malt
flavor
picking
up
some
interesting
notes
like
banana
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
odd
but
not
necessarily
bad
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
this
to
be
stronger
than
even
8
since
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
great
body
with
soft
yet
active
carbonation
o
a
nice
big
english
style
barleywine
not
overloaded
with
molasses
like
a
lot
of
them
are
but
still
quite
sweet
in
all
the
ways
that
you
would
expect
hefty
dark
malts
vanilla
and
a
little
fruitiness
goes
a
long
way
pretty
things
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
goto
breweries
o
great
beer
that
has
potential
to
be
excellent
with
some
age
i
think
complex
and
rich
very
enjoyable
overall
o
nice
english
barleywine
but
there
was
something
just
off
in
the
taste
that
i
wasnt
enjoying
very
nice
version
of
the
style
emphasis
on
flavor
rather
than
a
shovelhit
to
the
face
with
alcohol
id
have
this
again
o
like
this
barley
wine
very
formidable
job
well
done
on
a
solid
beer
o
interesting
rewarding
and
compelling
i
will
seek
out
this
beer
again
even
though
its
not
obviously
excellent
highly
recommended
originally
reviewed
12062010
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
unfortunately
as
it
was
bottled
only
a
few
months
ago
it
is
much
too
young
to
really
be
getting
the
grandeur
that
i
assume
it
will
one
day
show
and
that
is
what
i
will
leave
it
at
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
though
i
think
it
has
the
potential
to
be
stellar
with
some
age
on
it
o
i
tought
it
was
an
average
barleywine
but
seems
like
it
could
probably
settle
or
drink
better
with
a
little
time
on
it
a
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
styles
wish
i
had
one
to
age
longer
as
i
can
see
this
getting
better
overall
this
is
my
first
brew
from
pretty
things
and
i
am
definitely
enjoying
it
english
barleywines
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
im
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
recommended
i
thought
this
was
fantastic
id
like
to
buy
a
couple
more
of
these
have
another
fresh
and
another
a
few
years
down
the
road
o
very
nice
bwine
i
hope
to
find
more
reasonably
priced
bottles
outside
of
pa
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
beer
to
be
13
5
abv
but
then
again
barleywines
are
generally
well
above
10
i
enjoyed
it
well
done
ol
chap
my
finest
regards
to
the
brewers
this
is
an
interesting
tasty
example
of
an
english
barleywine
yeast
is
quite
flavorful
and
delicious
caramel
flavored
viscous
body
sweetness
is
a
bit
dominant
super
boozey
i
like
it
but
undeniable
booziness
with
the
13
5
abv
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
age
well
with
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
and
high
abv
after
taste
is
piney
hops
i
really
feel
they
flavor
profile
want
the
beer
to
be
served
on
the
warmer
side
glad
i
tried
it
md
big
and
powerful
deep
aromas
and
flavors
make
this
a
great
winter
beer
layered
and
semicomplex
another
good
pt
beer
o
a
very
nice
barleywine
one
of
my
favorites
of
this
style
for
sure
a
tid
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
very
nicley
done
not
aggressively
rounded
by
bitter
hoping
to
control
the
sweetness
but
just
enough
to
keep
it
all
together
overall
i
love
beers
like
this
gets
to
the
heart
of
what
i
want
in
beer
layers
and
layers
of
interesting
delicious
malt
flavors
strongly
suggest
picking
up
multiple
bottles
and
aging
them
o
a
decent
barleywine
alcohol
comes
through
way
to
much
id
like
a
better
hop
profile
o
i
can
see
this
one
smoothing
out
and
becoming
more
enjoyable
over
time
but
i
think
thats
about
612
months
away
right
now
theres
too
much
booze
and
not
enough
complexity
to
enjoy
it
i
would
love
to
have
a
bottle
with
some
age
but
fresh
id
have
to
pass
turned
out
to
be
a
good
choice
for
1000th
review
these
guys
are
what
i
like
in
craft
beer
peculiar
and
idiosyncratic
but
competent
the
taste
has
some
fruit
from
the
yeast
with
nutty
and
spiced
elements
a
nice
plum
like
tinge
with
stone
fruit
tanginess
and
light
caramel
notes
with
light
ripe
banana
accents
the
tast
has
a
slight
dark
sugar
like
muscovado
with
gentle
fig
and
hint
of
melon
with
mild
citrus
andd
mild
alcohol
w
nutty
semidry
hazelnut
like
toasted
accent
the
flavor
has
a
sweet
honey
tip
which
augments
the
grain
flavor
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
with
a
lot
of
complexity
with
fruit
flavors
that
rival
some
cognacs
the
barleywine
is
one
i
could
enjoy
frequently
if
not
for
the
relatively
high
abv
cheers
pretty
things
thanks
cuz
o
a
very
good
english
style
barley
wine
pretty
things
nailed
the
style
this
beer
is
worthy
of
the
cellar
94100
overall
not
in
my
top
5
ebw
but
just
shy
definately
deserving
of
its
top
25
ranking
in
the
style
would
gladly
drink
again
o
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
english
barleywines
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
am
also
a
big
fan
of
pretty
things
and
their
beers
never
disappoint
wonderfully
sweet
smooth
with
a
great
alcohol
wallop
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
not
too
thick
with
a
little
carbonation
of
course
this
is
a
pretty
pricey
brew
but
one
worth
getting
if
you
like
barleywine
for
such
a
high
abv
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
whew
final
thought
price
is
high
at
11
bucks
a
pop
but
worth
it
it
does
have
to
travel
pretty
far
to
get
here
the
13
abv
means
you
only
need
one
or
a
couple
if
you
are
a
nut
o
i
liked
this
beer
for
the
most
part
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
bit
too
boozey
from
the
smell
but
the
taste
wasnt
too
boozey
overall
pretty
good
for
a
barleywine
could
have
been
a
little
bit
less
syrupy
o
a
very
nice
sticky
sweet
offering
its
only
weakness
is
its
ultra
syrupyness
but
beer
is
to
be
enjoyed
and
not
overly
criticized
and
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
one
worth
a
pickup
despite
the
slightly
larger
than
average
price
tag
o
this
is
a
tremendously
refreshing
english
barleywine
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
for
the
high
abv
lovely
dark
fruits
throughout
mingling
with
caramel
bread
and
molasses
while
finishing
nice
and
roasty
exceptional
thanks
to
drewshal9
for
this
one
d
very
complex
and
actually
quite
drinkable
considering
how
strong
it
is
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
it
doesnt
seem
as
harsh
as
one
might
fear
from
a
beer
of
this
strength
nicely
done
and
im
sure
this
would
age
well
if
given
the
chance
single
finger
rapidly
dissipating
head
on
a
very
nice
dark
amber
body
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
very
different
than
most
barley
wines
this
one
has
more
of
a
chocolate
and
yeasty
aroma
with
earthy
notes
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
without
the
boozy
flavoring
that
so
man
y
barleywines
seem
to
have
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
very
differnent
from
other
barley
wines
i
have
had
and
one
of
my
favorites
very
dark
mahogany
color
with
white
filmy
head
smell
is
very
pleasant
but
basically
malt
and
dark
fruit
some
of
the
booze
does
come
through
though
which
is
a
slight
detractor
flavor
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
a
little
bit
of
tart
fruit
in
the
background
thick
bodied
i
really
like
this
beer
this
is
my
first
english
barleywine
and
im
not
sure
if
this
is
per
style
but
im
digging
it
a
lot
more
than
i
do
american
barleywines
very
nice
o
the
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
of
a
conundrum
for
me
as
i
dont
know
how
something
this
high
abv
with
all
the
right
barleywine
characteristics
can
be
as
thin
as
is
it
was
still
a
nice
tasting
brew
though
overall
a
nice
barleywine
mild
drinkable
and
approachable
overall
a
really
one
of
a
kind
tasty
and
complex
barleywine
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
definitely
will
pick
more
of
this
up
and
keep
some
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
it
evolves
thick
creamy
sticky
flavors
this
has
the
most
unusual
power
like
a
syrup
without
q
problem
bottled
november
2011
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
with
a
small
tanoffwhite
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
scent
is
a
bit
boozy
slight
brandy
aroma
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
and
sweet
caramel
malt
tons
of
malt
and
some
faint
english
hops
taste
is
nitially
dark
fruit
forward
with
hints
of
alcohol
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
though
a
lot
of
caramel
and
vanilla
with
intense
malt
flavors
raisins
dates
plums
and
english
malt
and
hops
with
a
nice
warming
boozy
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
bodies
with
nice
carbonation
and
slightly
syrupy
drinkability
is
scary
high
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
hard
to
distinguish
between
a
quad
and
this
english
barleywine
could
easily
pass
for
a
slightly
hoppy
quad
nevertheless
a
great
beer
o
seems
good
english
barleywines
are
hard
to
come
by
with
american
brewers
might
have
to
stick
with
good
old
j
w
lees
when
i
need
my
sweet
barleywine
fix
pours
a
clear
garnet
with
a
pretty
large
creamy
head
nose
is
thick
sticky
malt
honey
some
leafy
bitterness
mouth
is
malt
forward
sticky
a
definitely
leafy
finish
that
could
either
mean
this
is
a
touch
oxidized
or
its
something
about
this
particular
beer
sweet
honey
upfront
as
it
opened
the
leafy
finish
kind
of
calms
down
but
theres
still
something
there
i
dont
really
dig
feel
is
super
creamy
thick
and
velvet
overall
pretty
nice
but
not
one
of
the
better
english
barley
wines
or
old
ales
out
there
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
copperbrown
color
with
a
decent
sized
beige
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
and
lace
smells
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
bready
chocolate
aroma
with
a
hint
of
peanut
butter
i
swear
it
smells
like
a
peanut
butter
ball
a
little
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
up
front
dark
fruits
like
dried
cherries
plums
and
prunes
a
hint
of
warming
alcohol
comes
in
but
is
never
harsh
thick
body
with
a
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
and
a
low
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
big
beer
that
demands
respect
but
proves
to
be
quite
easy
to
consume
i
enjoyed
this
but
i
did
find
it
a
touch
boring
on
the
other
hand
id
love
to
see
how
this
ages
d
pretty
damn
tasty
beer
one
of
the
few
pretty
things
beers
that
ive
had
but
another
tasty
one
o
goes
down
easy
quite
tasty
not
too
filling
well
hidden
kick
nice
representation
of
style
im
not
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
appreciate
the
style
but
dont
often
seek
them
out
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
though
great
beer
zero
hopping
to
speak
of
and
a
great
hybridenglish
style
bw
i
would
be
interested
in
seeing
where
this
one
goes
in
the
cellar
highly
recommended
i
wish
it
were
a
little
easier
to
obtain
but
for
10
a
bomber
id
definitely
pick
this
up
again
thick
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
our
finest
regards
packs
a
ton
of
alcohol
that
it
hides
very
well
its
a
good
english
barleywine
i
think
with
some
age
on
it
this
one
will
improve
overall
i
dont
normally
enjoy
barley
wines
but
im
willing
to
make
an
exception
for
this
one
a
great
once
and
a
while
buy
a
very
solid
english
barleywine
from
pretty
things
its
great
to
see
them
turn
out
a
successful
big
beer
this
is
drinking
very
well
in
spite
of
its
youth
overall
a
pretty
nice
and
wellrounded
version
of
a
barley
wine
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
one
particular
respect
but
its
a
beer
id
be
happy
to
come
back
to
ill
have
to
find
some
of
the
next
batch
overall
honestly
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
i
have
ever
had
american
or
english
this
offering
really
impressed
me
and
a
steal
at
9
dollars
seek
this
one
out
odi
was
waiting
for
this
beer
for
a
while
this
is
a
big
beer
and
i
must
say
that
this
one
blew
me
away
and
far
exceeded
my
expectations
i
am
normally
a
hophead
however
this
one
really
made
my
night
just
needs
to
be
tried
seek
out
this
beer
this
brewery
can
do
no
wrong
big
thanks
to
gillard
for
this
one
it
pours
amber
with
copper
hues
and
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
fruity
with
dried
peaches
and
prunes
as
well
as
musty
maltiness
the
taste
delivers
hoppy
spiciness
and
some
yeastiness
flowing
quickly
into
sweet
malts
and
some
malt
roastiness
into
the
finish
the
spicy
hops
surge
forward
a
bit
super
tasty
well
balanced
and
a
sipper
clearly
from
its
size
a
massive
beer
that
opens
up
a
little
bit
more
with
every
sip
big
malty
nose
thats
more
reminiscent
of
various
fruits
than
toffee
or
caramel
plums
prunes
raisins
apple
butter
some
bready
malt
but
mainly
sweet
fruitiness
buttery
toffee
right
away
in
the
first
sip
though
more
complex
and
warming
than
it
smells
although
impressively
at
this
abv
its
not
terribly
boozy
the
fruitiness
continues
to
be
the
overwhelming
force
almost
a
syrupy
sweetness
but
a
sort
of
dry
almost
lightly
funky
bitterness
cuts
through
it
pretty
interesting
beer
here
definitely
worth
a
shot
the
feel
is
good
medium
bodies
with
good
carbonation
a
little
dry
to
finish
overall
another
well
made
beer
from
these
guys
a
nice
sipper
here
this
is
a
nice
sipper
that
emphasizes
the
quality
malts
used
i
nice
take
on
the
style
for
certain
some
warming
alcohol
comes
through
on
the
exhale
mouth
is
crisp
from
ample
carbonation
yet
goes
down
very
smooth
and
finishes
only
slightly
dry
well
done
here
overall
a
very
good
english
barleywine
that
would
be
a
treat
to
have
again
o
drinks
just
fine
but
this
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
abacus
or
the
other
greats
of
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
there
is
a
little
less
lacing
than
i
as
expecting
the
smell
is
dark
fruits
all
around
with
a
warm
alcohol
nose
at
the
end
the
flavr
is
malty
sweet
with
a
nice
dark
fruits
flavor
and
an
even
more
noticeable
alcohol
flavor
than
the
nose
was
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
extremely
well
carbed
this
beer
is
great
im
glad
i
grabbed
6
of
them
when
it
was
available
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
huge
head
of
tan
that
just
towered
over
the
top
of
the
glass
settling
down
smoothly
and
evenly
it
produced
a
thick
coating
of
lace
all
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
rich
vanilla
and
woody
aromas
are
being
picked
up
almost
immediately
huge
notes
of
oak
and
subtle
caramel
and
toffee
and
truly
dominating
here
for
sure
warming
only
brings
this
out
further
rich
and
decadent
sweet
aromas
just
building
off
each
other
here
the
first
sip
is
divine
subtle
and
rich
and
perfectly
carbonated
it
simply
rolls
across
the
tongue
with
a
gentleness
that
is
unheard
of
vanilla
and
caramel
merging
with
oak
like
notes
and
touches
of
earthy
hops
all
working
together
seamlessly
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
it
jump
on
it
this
one
is
really
good
im
surprised
this
one
isnt
getting
more
attention
honestly
overall
this
was
stupendous
nothing
really
different
especially
for
an
english
barleywine
but
really
solid
and
enjoyable
highly
recommended
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
this
brewery
yet
so
i
will
continue
to
purchase
everything
i
see
from
them
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
cloudy
grape
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
which
does
leave
some
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
grapy
with
some
figs
raisins
plums
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
grapy
with
a
nice
touch
of
dark
fruits
medium
body
no
way
this
is
13
5
abv
goes
down
very
nicely
a
very
tasty
brew
pours
a
caramel
brown
with
a
tan
head
those
nose
is
light
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
malts
no
alcohol
to
be
detected
for
such
a
big
beer
the
nose
is
a
bit
too
reserved
foreshadowing
a
bit
the
taste
is
really
mild
smooth
and
maybe
a
touch
lacking
just
like
the
nose
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
malts
all
pretty
lowkey
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
not
really
to
style
medium
carbonation
overall
the
accomplishment
of
this
beer
is
how
they
turned
13
5
into
a
smooth
mild
boozefree
barleywine
that
said
it
totally
lacked
the
punch
that
i
want
with
a
beer
like
this
a
bit
bland
unfortunately
sampled
at
daks
memorial
day
tasting
courtesy
of
beerbastard
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
with
a
khaki
head
aroma
has
some
caramel
and
grains
taste
is
sweet
with
some
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
finish
is
slightly
bitter
pretty
nice
beer
but
not
a
tradition
barleywine
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
very
well
balanced
you
would
never
guess
this
one
comes
in
at
13
5
very
nice
mouth
feel
and
extremely
smooth
if
you
still
see
any
of
this
around
i
would
def
reccommend
snagging
as
many
as
you
can
d
very
drinkable
its
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
or
too
boozy
definitely
malt
dominant
but
well
balanced
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
some
toffee
mixed
in
i
dont
really
get
any
hop
or
alcohol
notes
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
brown
sugar
alcohol
molasses
and
toffee
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
but
is
not
overpowering
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
heady
stuff
righteous
night
capper
way
to
go
large
pretty
things
gaining
major
respect
for
the
stones
shown
on
this
undertaking
all
in
all
this
was
a
nice
barleywine
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
which
sucks
cause
i
bought
two
bottles
hoping
to
age
one
but
i
dont
see
the
point
now
i
see
this
holding
up
for
a
year
and
a
half
but
not
improving
any
and
only
breaking
down
after
that
i
want
pretty
things
to
make
an
big
ass
american
barleywine
next
year
good
effort
though
o
a
cool
bw
and
not
your
average
one
but
i
guess
thats
to
be
expected
for
pretty
things
d
very
drinkable
which
is
remarkable
considering
the
13
5
abv
tons
of
flavor
but
well
balanced
and
never
gets
too
sweet
to
alcoholic
d
this
was
something
nice
to
enjoy
especially
with
a
friend
since
it
is
13
5
would
like
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
to
age
not
bad
though
overall
this
is
a
quality
english
barleywine
quite
smooth
and
the
fruit
character
is
well
done
with
the
abv
at
13
5
and
a
decent
hop
profile
i
see
this
beer
holding
up
well
for
years
to
come
i
definitely
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
to
try
and
one
to
throw
in
the
cellar
another
solid
brew
from
pretty
things
and
great
for
a
cold
winters
night
d
very
tasty
feels
good
could
drink
a
few
if
these
but
so
high
in
alcohol
overall
a
nice
english
barleywine
recommended
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
you
want
on
hand
for
the
perfect
occasion
like
a
snow
storm
or
other
miserable
weather
d
would
have
scored
higher
but
damn
huge
beer
drinks
very
easy
the
abv
is
well
hidden
this
spot
on
in
style
is
going
down
easy
as
cold
weather
has
returned
im
gonna
finish
this
bottle
with
some
hard
salami
blue
stilton
i
am
confident
this
will
pair
well
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
bodied
and
rich
with
a
tight
biting
carbonation
very
good
i
expect
this
will
age
well
given
the
decent
level
of
hops
and
effervesence
perhaps
the
subtleties
will
come
out
more
over
time
that
said
this
is
a
solid
traditional
powerhouse
of
a
barleywine
and
quite
drinkable
now
winter
20102011
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
orangey
brown
color
with
a
slightly
brown
tinted
thin
head
head
didnt
last
long
at
all
aroma
was
a
slighty
sweet
fruit
smell
not
as
syrupy
sweet
as
most
barleywines
slight
hints
of
burnt
oatmeal
flavor
was
sweet
started
off
akin
to
vanilla
finished
with
a
peppery
aftertaste
coated
very
well
in
the
mouth
almost
too
well
a
tad
too
syrupy
great
to
drink
very
well
rounded
beer
i
really
like
this
one
easy
enough
to
sip
over
time
the
abv
is
wellhidden
too
perhaps
its
too
hopforward
at
the
moment
for
the
style
anyway
but
i
think
this
one
should
hold
up
pretty
well
over
time
wish
i
had
another
to
keep
around
regardless
i
like
it
just
fine
now
this
beer
pour
a
beautiful
dark
ruby
with
about
a
half
finger
of
light
tan
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
the
nose
is
big
on
dark
fruit
and
rich
malt
the
taste
is
very
similar
maybe
with
a
little
carameltoffee
in
the
profile
seeing
that
this
was
made
with
a
blend
of
belgian
and
english
yeasts
the
mouthfeel
has
a
subtle
belgian
style
tiny
bubble
carbonation
feel
medium
to
full
bodied
and
leaves
an
oily
coating
all
over
the
mouth
at
an
abv
of
13
5
it
is
certainly
a
sipper
but
you
can
hardly
taste
a
lick
of
the
alcohol
very
enjoyable
much
closer
to
an
englishstyle
barleywine
than
the
hoppier
american
versions
our
finest
regards
is
dominated
by
sweet
malt
though
manages
to
be
far
short
of
cloying
strong
vinous
character
lots
of
dried
dark
fruit
and
balanced
by
a
toasted
nuttycaramely
flavor
very
good
d
made
it
through
at
13
very
drinkable
poured
almost
all
head
and
took
a
long
time
to
dissipate
ruddy
brown
color
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
percolating
to
the
top
medium
weight
body
strong
caramel
and
chocolate
component
as
well
as
malt
and
it
seemed
to
get
better
as
it
sat
and
warmed
really
a
fine
example
of
an
americanmade
barleywine
i
dont
drink
a
ton
of
barleywines
but
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
between
the
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
it
makes
me
think
of
an
english
style
quad
i
like
it
m
full
almost
syrupy
this
is
perpetuated
by
a
sluggish
carbonation
dthe
syrup
coating
makes
it
a
little
harder
to
drink
but
is
overall
a
very
nice
beer
on
a
snowy
day
much
better
in
the
mouth
big
full
bodied
monster
mouthfeel
lucious
malt
just
thick
and
creamy
huge
toffee
and
caramel
date
fig
prune
raisin
milk
chocolate
alcohol
herbal
hops
slightly
sweet
on
the
finish
and
a
little
hot
great
sipper
for
a
shitty
winter
day
like
today
dthis
beer
fell
a
little
flat
for
me
just
seems
to
be
missing
something
a
theme
with
what
i
have
had
from
pretty
things
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
bummer
this
is
a
favorite
style
of
mine
and
was
super
pumped
for
this
offering
d
really
different
especially
for
an
english
barleywine
but
quite
solid
and
enjoyable
cheers
d
some
alc
but
way
less
for
a
beer
this
high
in
abv
a
very
enjoyable
sipper
pours
a
dark
very
clear
caramel
hue
the
head
is
reduced
to
a
collar
after
a
short
while
smells
of
brown
sugar
dried
earthy
fruit
toffee
some
alcohol
too
but
its
surprisingly
reserved
given
the
high
abv
the
palate
closely
resembles
the
nose
highlighting
flavors
of
dried
fruit
apricot
berry
preserves
and
toffee
nice
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
though
its
a
clean
and
maltforward
beer
overall
medium
in
body
could
use
a
touch
more
viscosity
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
though
i
think
some
gentle
oxidation
would
give
the
beer
more
depth
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
age
for
a
couple
years
wheres
the
alcohol
dangerously
drinkable
im
a
fan
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
for
the
style
that
managed
to
not
overdo
it
on
the
sweetness
nice
balanced
and
well
worth
a
shot
this
is
one
heck
of
a
beer
that
is
really
balanced
and
warms
the
core
on
a
cold
winter
night
as
much
as
this
brew
seemed
to
have
going
for
it
i
must
say
that
the
drinkability
was
a
bit
below
average
decent
enough
flavors
but
i
feel
this
one
could
use
a
bit
of
age
to
see
how
the
flavors
mellow
and
meld
together
skal
pretty
solid
just
enough
sweetness
to
keep
it
together
great
esters
present
taste
is
sweet
to
start
fruity
in
the
middle
syrupy
at
the
close
with
alcohol
lingering
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
not
my
fave
pretty
thing
but
a
nice
brew
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
slightly
filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
if
youre
ok
with
the
heavy
sweetness
this
is
a
good
highoctane
beer
to
sip
on
for
a
long
time
d
i
dont
know
what
will
happen
to
this
with
age
but
this
english
barelywine
was
just
lacking
complexity
there
was
nothing
to
savor
in
this
bland
beer
and
i
was
shocked
it
came
from
pretty
things
debating
a
drain
pour
and
hoping
age
will
do
this
wonders
d
very
good
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
fantastic
flavor
nonetheless
mdvery
smooth
for
a
barleywine
nowhere
near
the
syrupy
thickness
that
i
normally
associate
with
the
style
leaves
a
bit
of
a
bittery
and
cooling
aftertaste
that
fades
to
a
soft
tingle
i
was
pretty
into
this
one
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
will
definitely
grab
another
one
medium
body
and
a
medium
carb
drinkability
a
tasty
barleywine
that
really
hides
the
abv
i
do
want
this
sipper
again
the
spices
are
present
but
not
overly
done
this
may
be
one
the
best
big
malt
monsters
ive
had
in
a
while
absolutely
perfect
for
sitting
around
the
fire
on
a
cold
winters
night
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
great
beer
probably
my
second
favorite
pt
beer
after
their
mild
a
very
nice
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
enjoyable
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
wish
it
had
more
depth
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
and
spritzy
which
is
actually
quite
nice
has
enough
body
to
support
the
booziness
the
higher
carbonation
makes
this
pretty
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
i
like
it
alot
d
the
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
13
5
it
definitely
tastes
strong
but
no
way
near
the
level
of
double
digits
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
retains
very
well
great
lacing
not
usually
something
you
see
from
such
a
high
abv
beer
in
my
experiences
aroma
is
of
cherries
bubble
gum
laffy
taffy
apples
smells
like
candy
raisins
tons
of
character
and
very
inviting
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
presence
taste
if
of
sweet
malts
taffy
cherries
vanilla
extract
figs
not
very
hoppy
at
all
dont
look
for
balance
here
gets
a
little
cloying
after
half
the
bomber
is
gone
this
is
definitely
a
beer
with
a
high
potential
for
aging
md
not
too
thick
not
too
dry
carbonation
is
really
spot
on
too
perfect
mouthfeel
actually
ans
despite
the
boozy
nose
pretty
drinkable
im
going
to
age
the
next
one
awhile
to
see
how
it
develops
i
have
a
feeling
this
could
only
get
better
with
age

and
approximately
half
an

head
eventually
settles
into
a
thin
skim
with
a
thick
band
around
the
shoulders
some
strands
of
lacing
evident
during
the
tasting
nose
reveals
dark
candied
fruit
unrefined
sugar
and
an
intermingling
of
alcohol
without
expressing
heat
or
an
overly
caustic
character
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
some
caramel
notes
come
out
in
the
flavor
profile
and
a
slightly
spicy
quality
is
detectable
at
the
finish
a
light
alcohol
presence
is
expressed
but
it
is
fairly
subdued
and
seems
to
nicely
intermingle
with
a
light
bittering
hops
flavor
that
helps
keep
the
brew
from
being
cloyingly
sweet

is
mediumlight
with
a

that
falls

texture

a

oily
across
the

and
some
residual
alcohol
heat
comes
out
and
lightly
lingers
at
the
finish
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
barleywine
right
out
of
the
bottle
heat
is
minimal
and
the
abv
is
deceptively
hidden
a
great
beer
to
crack
open
on
a
cold
winters
day
well
worth
your
time
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
are
any
barley
wines
easy
to
drink
this
one
is
interesting
but
youll
want
to
share
the
body
with
at
least
one
other
person
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
for
13
5
abv
and
it
goes
down
with
a
velvety
smoothness
overall
this
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
high
abv
beers
ive
come
across
and
can
only
imagine
how
well
this
will
age
d
whoa
had
no
idea
this
was
13
until
i
checked
this
site
i
guess
i
felt
it
but
certainly
didnt
taste
it
definitely
will
grab
another
to
age
d
good
bwine
and
a
def
candidate
for
aging
overall
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
makes
me
want
to
further
delve
into
the
world
of
barley
wines
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
smooth
and
dry
at
the
end
gives
off
a
nice
warmth
overcast
upon
the
body
drinkability
is
definitely
suitable
for
the
winter
sipperslow
for
the
frigid
cold
weather
if
youve
got
some
bottles
age
now
drink
later
i
first
tried
this
at
the
otherside
cafe
in
boston
it
came
out
in
a
tulip
which
displays
the
deep
amber
tone
well
and
shows
off
its
very
aromatic
fruity
scent
at
first
taste
its
a
smooth
malty
almost
syrupy
texture
they
are
very
fond
of
their
barley
blends
on
this
one
and
you
definitely
get
that
its
a
warm
spicy
brew
it
carries
a
festive
fruity
flavor
that
made
it
feel
very
festive
for
the
winter
holidays
i
enjoyed
the
glass
so
well
that
i
bought
a
bottle
down
the
street
for
later
wow
flavors
have
meshed
well
and
the
alcohol
has
integrated
well
making
this
beer
as
impressive
as
it
was
when
i
first
had
it
if
not
more
so
kind
of
reminds
me
of
an
expertly
brewed
old
ale
at
this
point
luckily
i
found
this
aged
in
the
store
because
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
dont
have
the
willpower
to
age
in
my
cellar
i
tend
to
find
it
and
crack
it
open
before
ive
let
it
age
properly
wonderful
beer
all
around
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
on
the
east
coast
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
i
am
only
just
becoming
familiar
with
englishstyle
barleywines
and
this
one
is
definitely
going
to
turn
me
on
to
more
of
the
style
the
complexity
of
the
malt
is
just
a
great
experience
which
in
the
case
of
this
beer
can
be
enjoyed
for
a
couple
hours
d
not
a
session
beer
but
tastes
great
and
quite
drinkable
nonetheless
d
good
boozy
but
good
pretty
sure
this
ones
going
to
cellar
nicely
ill
tuck
a
bottle
or
two
away
and
check
back
in
a
few
d
really
nice
sipper
for
a
barley
wine
and
the
abv
is
deceiving
this
may
be
my
favorite
brew
from
pretty
things
to
date
this
barleywines
flavors
just
never
shown
through
past
the
big
alcohol
character
its
hard
to
use
the
word
bland
to
describe
a
13
5
english
barleywine
but
thats
the
first
thing
that
jumps
to
my
mind
no
creamy
malt
flavors
no
rich
aged
fruit
no
interesting
sharp
alcohol
flavors
etc
maybe
this
one
is
just
too
young
to
appreciate
clear
deep
amber
and
slightly
coppery
in
colour
with
a
yellowbeige
cap
of
mostly
fine
bubbles
good
head
retention
particularly
for
the
abv
with
sticky
lacing
nice
aroma
lots
of
bread
plums
raisins
alcohol
toast
toffee
slightly
buttery
with
a
hint
of
berries
as
it
warms
hops
had
more
presence
in
the
flavour
contributing
sturdy
bitterness
that
was
just
underneath
the
surface
flavours
and
a
bit
of
grassy
character
sweet
malts
plums
and
alcohol
were
dominant
with
the
sweetness
well
short
of
cloying
notes
of
roses
berries
and
figs
appeared
as
it
warmed
heavy
in
body
lightish
in
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
with
considerable
alcohol
warmth
but
no
strong
heat
quite
tasty
overall
but
it
left
me
with
the
impression
that
it
could
stand
up
to
and
benefit
from
a
little
bit
of
aging
so
that
the
flavours
meld
together
a
bit
more
i
think
ill
grab
a
couple
more
of
these
for
the
cellar
d
bam
d
very
drinkable
perfect
for
relaxed
and
slow
enjoyment
great
sunday
warmer
for
watching
a
classic

football
game
like

or

rivalry
looking
forward
to
retain
a
few
bottles
for
aging
this
one
is
a
keeper
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
average
carbonation
creamy
very
drinkable
you
have
to
remind
yourself
to
slowly
nurse
well
done
dan
a
very
tasty
beer
and
very
dangerously
drinkable
for
those
cold
winter
nights
it
will
do
well
in
my
cellar
as
well
which
looks
like
the
rabbit
hole
on
the
label
d
very
nice
a
great
winter
warmerat
least
while
this
new
this
should
age
exceptionally
well
cant
wait
to
have
one
next
christmas
i
havent
had
a
single
sip
of
beer
this
week
unusual
for
me
so
i
decided
to
reward
myself
tonight
with
something
that
packs
a
punch
our
finest
regards
pours
out
a
beautiful
rose
color
with
a
creamy
two
inches
of
white
heading
a
big
perfume
of
alcohol
hits
immediately
as
it
warms
followed
by
some
stone
fruits
similar
taste
as
there
is
with
the
nose
but
there
is
an
undercurrent
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
to
be
had
that
reminds
me
of
some
of
my
favorites
from
this
style
body
is
not
as
big
as
the
abv
suggests
but
with
that
being
said
it
is
one
to
share
with
others
although
i
like
the
fact
that
this
is
a
barleywine
with
lots
of
unsympathetic
alcohol
content
and
flavor
i
would
imagine
this
is
going
to
be
even
better
with
two
to
three
years
of
age
on
it
a
true
winter
warmer
we
have
here
from
pretty
things
cheers
still
the
base
is
fantastic
i
am
just
unsure
what
the
cardamom
does
for
this
candied
fruits
caramel
toffee
boozy
cask
on
chai
at
town
hall
tap
gives
a
different
twist
on
this
english
style
barleywine
easy
to
drink
barleywine
smooth
and
whatnot
this
version
has
less
carbonation
and
more
caradamom
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
d
a
sipper
for
sure
given
the
abv
a
decent
example
of
style
but
nothing
special
the
cardamom
is
an
interesting
twist
3
5
overall
while
i
am
not
sure
that
the
core
barleywine
is
anything
special
the
bourbon
and
cardamom
helps
make
this
interesting
and
enjoyable
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
with
very
little
carbonation
has
a
boozy
aftertaste
not
very
well
made
in
my
opinion
i
will
pass
on
this
beer
in
the
future
b
drinkability
is
great
but
this
is
definitely
a
bottle
for
sharing
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
drag
after
a
couple
of
hours
which
is
what
it
takes
to
drink
this
bottle
solo
it
never
stops
smelling
great
however
best
thing
i
have
had
from
lift
bridge
so
far
not
quite
o
overall
not
a
bad
barleywine
alcohol
hidden
well
could
use
a
hair
more
age
but
for
all
intensive
purposes
a
solid
beer
commander
is
a
very
fine
brew
but
the
alcohol
content
and
sweetness
are
almost
too
much
i
poured
about
10ozs
for
myself
and
i
cant
even
finish
it
despite
my
admiration
for
much
of
its
qualities
thanks
aaron
for
shipping
me
this
bad
boy
overall
a
very
unique
brew
that
i
can
appreciate
due
to
how
outside
the
box
and
creative
it
is
however
not
my
type
of
barleywine
at
all
and
one
that
made
me
realize
that
i
dont
like
cardamon
in
beer
at
all
o
seems
different
than
last
year
more
bourbon
decent
beer
i
didnt
find
the
spice
overwhelming
more
dark
fruit
than
i
was
expecting
i
think
i
will
pass
next
year
o
good
no
major
issues
but
the
sweetness
was
really
in
your
face
o
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
its
underrated
and
i
think
this
stands
up
well
against
other
well
known
barley
wines
this
has
such
a
great
complexity
and
balance
that
its
hard
to
achieve
in
a
beer
this
big
this
is
my
first
beer
ive
tried
from
lift
bridge
and
i
am
very
impressed
mad
props
to
my
friend
sara
jane
for
hooking
it
up
thanks
again
sara
pours
a
light
brown
that
is
almost
plum
in
color
and
develops
a
thin
layer
of
khaki
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
some
bubbly
legs
strewn
across
the
surface
the
aroma
is
of
plum
dark
cherry
candied
apple
sweet
caramel
a
bit
of
oak
and
faint
bourbon
and
vanilla
it
smells
much
fruitier
than
anticipated
and
the
barrel
notes
are
very
subtle
in
the
nose
taste
brings
a
large
change
of
pace
ample
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
jump
our
with
the
fruits
playing
second
fiddle
more
plum
cherry
and
some
date
all
rear
their
heads
brown
sugar
caramel
and
a
bit
of
hazelnut
are
detectable
as
well
mouthfeel
is
rich
in
flavor
but
there
is
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
to
keep
things
lively
not
overly
sticky
or
cloyingly
sweet
overall
this
one
reminds
me
a
lot
of
founders
backwoods
bastard
which
i
enjoy
greatly
the
dryness
from
the
wood
and
bourbon
really
complements
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
and
malt
flavors
this
one
makes
for
a
great
evening
sipper
overall
this
beer
being
as
young
as
it
is
was
just
ok
we
had
last
years
version
recently
and
was
blown
away
by
the
good
that
a
year
of
aging
can
do
to
this
beer
id
definitely
recommend
holding
on
to
this
beer
for
at
least
10
months
or
longer
just
to
let
the
spice
die
down
this
beer
will
get
much
better
as
it
ages
o
wow
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
it
the
bourbon
aging
went
really
well
with
the
complexity
of
the
beer
d
and
o
i
feel
this
beer
has
aged
very
well
and
is
extremely
drinkable
im
torn
on
how
to
review
this
because
im
really
enjoying
it
but
i
feel
with
the
spice
quality
and
the
mint
its
not
really
true
to
style
so
i
will
rate
it
as
such
but
please
note
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
some
of
the
big
bodied
ba
barleywines
ive
been
drinking
as
of
late
o
not
a
amazing
overwhelming
ba
barleywine
but
still
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
wouldnt
try
again
though
o
overall
this
is
a
perplexing
beer
there
really
are
hints
of
greatness
here
but
as
a
whole
it
just
doesnt
quite
come
together
i
think
the
cardamom
could
be
a
really
cool
addition
to
a
barleywine
but
it
needs
scaled
down
similarly
they
need
to
find
a
way
to
make
it
a
touch
less
ethanolboozey
i
really
do
think
with
a
couple
tweaks
this
could
be
a
terrific
beer
but
as
is
its
just
a
unique
but
far
too
boozy
and
not
terribly
well
done
barleywine
that
being
said
i
do
recommend
it
to
others
cause
the
uniqueness
alone
is
worth
checking
out
just
make
sure
you
have
a
friend
or
two
to
share
the
bottle
with
this
one
needs
some
age
on
it
i
had
a
side
by
side
2012
and
2011
the
bourbon
taste
is
over
powering
for
a
fresh
batch
you
cant
taste
the
subtle
notes
of
carmel
and
nuts
the
aged
one
however
the
bourbon
was
very
toned
down
and
you
could
get
the
caremel
and
nutty
notes
much
easier
o
this
beer
was
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
still
the
base
beer
is
a
bit
lacking
compared
to
other
topnotch
barrelaged
barleywines
and
it
took
a
while
to
get
used
to
the
cardamom
give
it
a
go
its
definitely
interesting
overall
while
this
beer
is
quite
sweet
i
still
found
my
pour
very
easy
to
drink
i
thought
it
was
very
smooth
and
would
have
more
in
the
future
overall
its
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
too
crazy
i
did
not
get
much
for
barrel
notes
from
this
beer
if
i
did
not
know
it
was
barrel
aged
i
would
have
thought
it
did
spend
any
time
in
a
barrel
it
tastes
like
a
halls
but
still
good
can
blow
a
cool
breeze
not
as
bad
at
the
ba
rating
thanks
mnbearsfan
o
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
barleywine
but
its
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
i
really
enjoyed
the
apple
notes
right
up
front
which
i
havent
tasted
in
a
barleywine
before
im
extremely
happy
to
have
tried
this
beer
and
would
to
have
more
again
in
the
future
overall
this
was
a
terrible
beer
i
wont
drink
much
if
this
just
not
for
me
sorry
lb
but
the
recipe
needs
to
change
o
decent
ba
barleywine
really
wish
they
had
went
way
lighter
on
the
cardamom
as
i
am
not
sure
what
it
adds
at
this
level
of
dominance
that
said
it
is
clearly
fading
and
if
i
had
another
i
would
wait
a
year
or
so
in
hopes
the
spice
notes
dissipate
further
lastly
my
stomach
was
a
bit
upset
afterward
and
even
though
i
have
indefinite
tolerance
for
heat
and
spice
i
blame
it
on
the
liberal
handfuls
of
spice
thrown
into
the
brew
gotta
ding
the
score
for
this
i
could
do
8
oz
of
this
beer
next
time
the
spice
differentiates
the
beer
but
doesnt
necessarily
make
it
better
at
all
without
the
spice
this
could
be
great
because
all
the
other
qualities
of
a
killer
barleywine
are
there
with
the
spice
its
still
drinkable
to
daring
palates
and
recommended
but
probably
just
a
slightly
subpar
barleywine
very
happy
to
see
interesting
offerings
coming
out
of
stillwater
oh
dear
this
beer
is
a
cardamon
bomb
interesting
and
strong
the
spice
dominates
eclipsing
all
other
flavors
and
perception
i
couldnt
finish
a
bottle
myslef
or
a
pint
not
a
repeat
for
me
too
much
o
overall
an
interesting
beer
a
ton
of
spice
and
cardamom
in
the
nose
that
is
weird
and
doesnt
work
well
but
the
taste
is
really
nice
and
is
missing
most
of
that
worth
checking
out
for
the
taste
i
really
did
not
see
where
they
were
going
with
this
and
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
spicing
at
all
this
was
a
bit
of
a
miss
for
me
i
was
pretty
excited
to
try
this
but
i
think
the
cardamom
was
used
a
bit
too
much
tone
it
back
let
the
base
beer
and
barrel
treatment
blend
everything
together
and
this
could
easily
be
a
great
one
the
beer
is
bright
orange
with
a
small
fleeting
off
white
head
the
aroma
offers
sweet
malt
and
an
abundant
spice
character
mint
pepper
cardamom
ehh
this
is
ok
but
not
my
thing
minty
spicy
sweet
i
can
understand
why
some
people
may
enjoy
this
more
than
i
but
again
this
is
not
my
cup
of
teabeer
alcohol
is
pretty
mild
considering
the
high
abv
a
good
beer
for
sure
and
worth
a
try
overall
a
pretty
nice
take
on
an
english
barleywine
far
from
traditional
but
the
spices
add
a
nice
flavor
i
dont
exactly
now
what
to
say
about
this
one
i
really
think
it
would
be
an
excellent
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
cardamom
overload
as
it
is
its
an
average
ba
barley
wine
i
would
love
to
try
this
with
a
couple
years
on
it
to
let
the
cardamom
die
down
by
far
the
best
lift
bridge
beer
i
ever
had
one
of
the
better
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywines
might
be
worth
buying
another
and
age
it
for
a
couple
of
years
d
very
happy
to
have
tried
it
though
overall
impression
very
rich
and
perfect
amount
of
character
enjoyed
thoroughly
and
will
be
looking
for
more
of
this
brew
at
a
later
date
first
time
having
anything
from
lift
bridge
and
was
impressed
thanks
chris
o
hugely
dissapointed
by
lbs
commander
not
a
single
person
at
our
tasting
enjoyed
this
and
its
no
wonder
what
exactly
was
to
be
accomplished
here
without
question
this
beer
is
one
to
avoid
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
way
too
sweet
and
herbal
for
me
it
could
have
been
a
little
more
balanced
and
the
herbal
flavors
could
have
been
toned
down
some
as
well
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
traditional
barleywine
characteristics
to
show
through
as
well
as
the
barrel
flavors
it
wasnt
a
terrible
beer
but
it
isnt
something
id
buy
o
nowhere
near
what
the
early
reviews
suggested
i
understand
the
home
team
bump
but
i
cant
believe
how
badly
mn
locals
misrepresented
this
one
this
is
nowhere
near
a
memorable
english
barleywine
i
would
expect
this
is
what
i
would
get
from
the
next
stone
plus
two
random
breweries
collaboration
barleywine
overly
sweet
way
too
much
residual
sugar
herbal
knavery
what
can
i
say
its
mediocre
decidedly
mediocre
pours
burnt
orange
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smells
mostly
like
caramel
and
toffee
with
hints
of
vanilla
the
cardamom
that
is
added
comes
through
fairly
strongly
a
bit
of
bourbon
but
not
much
a
sweet
flavor
mostly
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
vanilla
to
it
too
the
cardamom
is
again
noticeable
much
more
bourbon
than
on
the
nose
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
grape
flavor
too
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
overall
a
solid
beer
but
that
spice
is
detracting
it
adds
nothing
positive
4

this
goes
down
so
well
and
the
flavor
works
awesomely
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
i
really
hope
they
decide
to
make
this
one
again
interested
to
see
how
this
ages
but
it
sure
does
drink
tremendously
right
now
o
wow
i
was
pretty
let
down
by
this
beer
the
cardamom
which
i
had
no
idea
what
it
was
until
we
opened
this
bottle
just
takes
over
the
beer
big
mint
and
ginger
really
sweet
not
a
lot
of
bourbon
o
well
if
youre
a
cardamom
fan
i
think
youre
probably
going
to
rate
this
in
your
top
5
cardamom
beers
for
sure
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
plant
or
the
overthetop
sweetness
and
lack
of
barrel
notes
would
not
drink
again
and
cant
recommend
o
found
out
later
this
is
cardamom
and
not
lavender
there
was
entirely
too
much
of
that
flavor
and
it
was
not
good
cant
drink
much
either
they
have
different
taste
buds
in
the
land
of
the
golden
gophers
or
the
early
reviews
were
a
product
of
hyping
something
local
sadly
this
beer
is
a
wreck
and
i
would
never
drink
it
again
they
said
best
enjoyed
in
smaller
portions
trust
me
they
cant
get
small
enough
d
did
i
get
the
right
beer
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
advertised
barrelaging
and
only
a
little
of
the
barleywine
if
you
loved
poppaskull
then
youll
probably
love
this
beer
but
if
youre
like
me
and
have
limited
tolerance
for
cardamom
then
youll
probably
hate
it
either
way
to
me
its
monodimensional
and
hard
to
drink
it
large
quantities
very
nice
deep
bronze
color
not
much
head
wise
but
a
definate
nice
carbonation
level
malty
and
slight
bourbon
aroma
buttery
sweetness
simply
a
great
flavor
overall
just
a
huge
malt
bomb
massive
caramel
sweetness
distinct
bourbon
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
and
not
massively
oakey
the
cardomon
lends
a
sublte
mildly
anise
like
spice
to
it
huge
mouthfeel
extremely
sweet
and
sticky
i
would
rate
it
higher
as
it
is
what
i
like
but
trying
to
keep
it
in
line
overall
a
killer
uk
barleywine
in
my
book
very
sweet
and
big
which
may
be
a
turn
off
to
some
at
12
5
there
is
not
a
hint
of
booze
for
miles
many
thanks
to
mnbearsfan
for
this
secret
santa
sample
wowzers
great
great
stuff
and
going
on
my
wants
o
this
is
right
about
where
i
would
expect
it
to
be
from
the
brewery
a
well
made
barleywine
in
bourbon
barrels
tastes
great
and
works
well
i
dont
see
this
having
an
amazing
following
and
its
not
worth
freaking
out
about
a
locally
made
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
it
is
and
i
love
it
for
that
check
it
out
if
ya
get
a
chance
and
ill
surely
track
down
more
bottles
as
well
as
pick
some
up
as
the
years
go
by
if
they
continue
to
brew
it
split
a
bottle
with
a
friend
but
this
beer
was
so
big
it
wouldnt
have
hurt
to
have
a
3rd
it
poured
a
deep
red
with
a
weaker
offwhite
head
and
larger
bubbles
that
seemed
to
indicate
the
higher
abv
wow
the
aroma
jumps
out
of
my
goblet
and
is
rich
and
fruity
with
vanilla
coconut
and
pineapple
upfront
the
flavor
is
equally
rich
but
not
over
the
top
or
cloyingly
sweet
the
strong
but
gentle
bourbon
flavors
blend
seamlessly
with
fruity
esters
making
one
of
the
best
barrel
and
beer
collaborations
ive
tasted
its
hard
to
tell
where
the
complex
beer
character
ends
and
the
barrel
starts
it
may
have
been
18
for
a
bottle
but
its
worth
trying
at
least
once
great
job
lbb
you
guys
nailed
it
a
definite
sipper
and
another
good
beer
from
a
local
brewery
i
decided
to
cellar
two
bottles
of
this
to
try
at
a
later
date
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
bottle
number
two
will
not
last
a
year
the
flavor
was
much
of
the
same
and
i
was
surprised
how
smooth
this
was
for
such
a
big
beer
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
with
a
couple
years
on
it
i
really
have
to
commend
lift
bridge
on
a
stellar
brew
this
is
phenomenal
overall
i
love
good
beer
and
i
love
good
bourbon
whiskey
so
this
is
really
the
best
of
both
worlds
full
and
robust
flavors
smooth
as
silk
and
strong
as
hell
an
excellent
english
barleywine
from
our
own
little
minnesota
brewery
lift
bridge
well
done
lift
bridge
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
a
great
first
barrelaged
effort
by
a
young
brewery
delighted
to
have
a
few
bottles
to
see
how
this
one
turns
in
the
next
year
or
two
lift
bridge
do
this
again
or
something
like
it
this
is
a
unqualified
success
i
wouldnt
call
this
anywhere
near
a
traditional
english
barleywinewhat
with
the
spicing
and
the
barrel
aging
it
overshadows
the
toffeecaramel
flavors
that
i
would
have
expected
that
said
its
pretty
damn
tasty
and
is
right
for
the
season
the
overall
impression
is
one
of
a
beefedup
christmas
ale
and
i
think
one
of
the
most
impressive
features
is
that
even
without
any
age
on
it
the
12
5
alcohol
is
smooth
and
well
integrated
good
and
exceptionally
interestingdefinitely
a
step
forward
for
lift
bridge
super
smooth
all
the
classic
barrel
aged
english
barleywine
flavors
but
ramped
up
with
dark
fruits
and
oak
superb
kuhnhenn
has
yet
another
excellent
barrel
aged
offering
with
their
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
it
comes
accross
as
just
a
bit
hot
but
is
a
pleasing
quaff
nonetheless
as
with
everything
else
ive
had
from
kuhnhenn
i
was
quite
happy
to
have
a
chance
to
try
this
and
would
love
to
try
one
with
a
little
age
at
some
point
way
too
much
bourbon
for
me
too
boozy
having
this
next
to
aaron
this
was
quite
disappointing
the
beer
was
hot
watery
with
some
spicy
hops
on
the
back
some
sweetness
balances
this
beer
out
but
in
general
tastes
more
towards
an
barrel
aged
american
barleywine
rating
from
brewery
visit
ab
a
month
ago
had
this
at
kuhnhenn
on
tap
about
1
month
ago
and
it
was
really
good
not
usually
a
barleywine
guy
but
due
to
being
bb
i
liked
it
o
a
worldclass
english
barleywine
and
a
great
way
to
wind
down
the
weekend
loved
the
strong
wood
presence
the
slick
mouthfeel
and
everything
about
the
way
it
tastes
this
is
about
as
good
as
a
ba
english
barleywine
gets
though
it
didnt
unseat
what
i
think
is
the
king
of
the
style
mother
of
all
storms
not
a
big
fan
of
barley
wines
but
had
this
at
the
brewery
and
enjoyed
it
still
pour
with
a
wonderful
nose
of
liquified
butterscotch
taste
just
cant
match
and
is
very
brown
sugar
forward
a
nice
treat
and
surprise
thanks
kyle
needs
more
carbonation
nearly
flat
very
boozy
sweet
but
finishes
fairly
clean
overall
really
really
good
quite
strong
of
course
but
the
alcohol
never
overpowers
lots
of
aroma
and
flavor
all
over
the
place
and
a
good
feel
to
support
the
show
a
great
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
very
much
enjoyed
this
thanks
again
dad
highly
recommended
the
beer
pours
much
darker
than
the
regular
barleywine
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
loose
offwhiteslightly
grayish
head
and
no
sediment
the
nose
has
deep
notes
of
bourbon
leather
raisins
slight
booze
and
mild
sweetnessfruit
when
it
warms
the
taste
is
a
rush
of
barrel
flavors
heavy
on
the
oak
tannins
and
bourbon
caramel
definitely
more
more
balanced
as
it
warms
that
transitions
into
the
warming
caramelvanilla
notes
in
time
its
full
bodied
bold
and
slightly
syrupy
with
minimal
carbonation
with
some
harsher
oak
bitterness
which
cuts
deeply
into
the
beers
bready
body
and
leaves
burning
ethanol
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
i
prefer
the
regular
fgr
barleywine
in
mouthfeel
but
think
this
will
not
disappoint
someone
looking
for
big
barrel
notes
in
a
bbbw
overall
though
it
doesnt
have
enough
beer
style
character
and
is
slightly
heavy
on
the
booze
but
its
got
impressive
flavors
to
round
out
everything
else
going
on
oan
amazing
beer
nice
balance
one
of
of
the
better
ba
barleywines
out
there
overall
great
just
that
one
bbq
sauce
possible
oxidation
thing
otherwise
nice
bourbon
toffee
brandy
raisin
malts
etc
o
overall
this
beer
was
a
bit
disappointing
probably
should
have
drank
it
last
year
verdict
a
truly
delicious
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
from
kuhnhenn
and
the
best
beer
ive
tried
from
them
surpassing
bb4d
which
i
didnt
think
possible
the
complexity
is
astounding
on
the
tongue
and
the
marshmallow
character
is
wonderful
if
only
it
had
a
richer
thicker
body
to
carry
the
flavors
cheers
to
kuhnhenn
for
this
masterclass
im
not
getting
a
ton
of
bourbon
off
of
this
but
the
barrelbeer
blend
is
fantastic
incredibly
smooth
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
big
beer
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
tangerine
hues
nose
is
superb
like
a
rich
candy
toffee
caramel
and
vanilla
dominate
a
bit
of
golden
raisins
and
figs
come
out
too
bourbon
comes
out
nicely
in
the
finish
really
nicely
done
sweet
rich
and
smooth
a
beer
of
epic
proportions
thanks
for
opening
this
joe
phenomenal
english
barleywine
probably
the
best
ive
had
to
date
that
wasnt
made
from
thirdrun
barrels
its
very
similar
to
bourbon
county
barleywine
but
the
smell
on
this
one
blows
away
the
bcbw
i
do
think
the
bcbw
is
more
balanced
and
easier
to
drink
either
way
if
you
enjoy
sweet
and
boozy
barleywines
this
is
absolutely
your
beer
overall
another
phenomenal
beer
from
kuhnhenn
these
guys
seem
to
nail
it
every
time
i
hope
i
will
be
able
to
get
this
again
in
the
near
future
i
think
trevor
presario
brought
this
one
its
not
everyday
i
find
three
year
old
notes
then
again
its
not
everyday
i
clean
out
the
closet
o
im
blown
away
the
flavors
here
are
so
well
integrated
and
complement
each
other
perfectly
this
is
a
huge
beer
that
youll
want
to
take
your
time
with
this
is
a
ba
barleywine
that
other
ba
barleywines
should
strive
to
be
such
a
treat
and
such
a
great
beer
robust
ominous
and
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
i
can
recall
drinking
in
recent
memory
though
many
people
would
argue
id
say
that
i
enjoy
this
beer
much
more
than
bourbon
barrel
fourth
dementia
this
beer
is
just
so
hard
to
criticize
ill
be
sure
to
stock
up
on
this
each
time
kuhnhenn
releases
it
such
an
awesome
barley
wine
overall
fantastic
stuff
pretty
much
a
benchmark
for
a
bb
bwine
o
didnt
smell
that
great
but
the
layers
of
flavors
are
amazing
so
good
and
inviting
delicious
o
lived
up
to
the
hype
really
enjoyed
this
barleywine
smoothness
helped
a
lot
o
this
beer
is
nothing
short
of
world
class
and
i
want
more
overall
an
immense
beer
in
every
respect
incredible

a
top
barley
wine
for
me
pours
a
near
flat

color
without
any

caramel
vanilla
leather
and
tobacco
fill
my

with
a

suit
with
very
smooth

tobacco
and
bourbon
are
warming
in
the
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
despite
being
nearly
15

this
drinks
crazy
well
a
rich
smooth
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
barrel
aged
sipper
thanks
again
justin
other
than
that
this
is
a
bigbodied
barleywine
with
enough
booze
and
intensity
to
take
on
the
strongest
beer
aficionado
overall
great
beer
not
dominated
by
the
bourbon
but
not
understated
a
good
and
tasty
bourbon
barleywine
the
strength
in
taste
comes
as
bourbon
but
the
vanilla
and
toffee
catch
up
easily
my
first
kuhnhenns
and
definitely
not
my
last
a
good
and
balanced
bourbon
barleywine
easliy
worth
the
price
i
paid
8
per
12
oz
o
this
is
truly
one
of
the
best
brews
ive
had
all
year
possible
in
the
last
few
o
this
beer
is
beyond
fantastic
definitely
the
second
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
behind
king
henry
highly
recommended
o
really
nice
beer
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
want
to
open
this
beer
but
its
really
good
overall
a
top
notch
barleywine
could
use
a
few
of
these
for
the
upcoming
winter
overall
this
is
a
amazing
example
of
the
style
it
is
everything
i
could
ask
for
in
a
ba
barleywine
and
it
comes
in
a
12oz
awesome
sipper
plenty
of
bourbon
against
the
barleywine
backbone
tons
going
on
here
caramel
sweetness
bready
barrel
character
boozy
warmth
among
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
tasted
i
actually
prefer
this
over
kh
truly
unfortunate
that
i
dont
have
any
more
of
these
o
i
really
like
this
one
just
a
super
solid
bourbon
barley
wine
definitely
up
there
near
my
favorites
this
is
from
2011
so
it
has
a
bit
of
time
on
the
second
tier
of
bbbw
only
1stgod
tier
bbbw
is
king
henry
imo
cost
8
for
a
12
oz
bottle
m
full
body
very
light
carbonation
carbonation
is
a
little
low
but
works
somewhat
well
for
this
beer
o
damned
good
one
is
enough
though
heck
honestly
this
beer
is
a
monster
would
love
to
have
again
not
as
good
or
as
rounded
as
moas
or
older
vintages
of
arctic
devil
but
pretty
much
a
world
class
beer
worth
looking
for
and
hording
as
much
as
possible

quite

fantastic
probably
the
best
barleywine
ive
tried
so
far
took
me
by
surprise
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
really
great
beer
the
barleywine
flavors
were
really
good
the
bourbon
was
really
good
and
together
they
complimented
each
other
excellently
overall
it
really
comes
together
well
and
was
definitely
one
of
the
better
barrel
aged
versions
of
the
style
ive
had
o
overall
an
excellent
ba
barleywine
barreling
is
well
done
hops
really
dont
play
much
of
a
role
in
the
beer
at
all
the
barrel
is
the
balancing
element
against
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
the
malt
is
candylike
sweet
and
complex
with
many
different
sugary
impressions
made
the
bourbon
gives
this
a
kick
that
it
needs
and
really
cuts
thru
the
sweetness
to
bring
this
back
into
balance
very
well
done
but
i
didnt
really
expect
anything
less
from
this
one
5
0
d
a
taste
could
have
also
been
a
5
0
so
ill
add
it
here
really
wonderful
beer
kuhnhenn
are
masters
at
hiding
booze
while
delivering
the
amount
of
flavor
that
you
can
only
get
from
a
huge
abv
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
bb4d
but
damn
close
o
this
is
a
good
beer
for
sure
i
enjoyed
this
one
iso
more
of
this
beer
fantastic
this
ranked
as
one
of
the
highest
in
our
blind
barrelaged
barleywine
tasting
kuhnhenn
does
some
amazing
barrel
aged
beers
i
didnt
really
notice
any
oxidation
despite
the
3
5
years
of
age
this
is
a
great
barrel
aged
english
barelywine
ale
although
i
prefer
their
barrel
aged
4th
dementia
pours
a
slightly
murky
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
fades
to
nothing
there
is
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
and
some
alcohol
taste
is
much
better
with
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
wood
and
bourbon
flavors
there
is
an
alcohol
kick
in
the
throat
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
that
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
o
amazing
barleywine
this
could
be
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
and
i
have
had
kh
moas
ba
ne
etc
will
have
to
try
and
get
a
case
of
this
if
i
ever
have
the
chance
drink
in
the
end
this
was
actually
very
tasty
had
a
few
flaws
but
was
tasty
boozy
grainy
and
oaky
vanilla
bottle
to
snifter
looks
good
dark
and
thick
with
minimal

great
bourbon
candied

this
brewery
really
has
the
barreling
down
to
a
science
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
overall
a
fantastic
brew
that
i
really
appreciate
getting
to
try
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
really
sweet
and
warm
but
that
was
to
be
expected
i
would
like
to
get
some
more
of
this
to
let
it
sit
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
how
it
is
at
that
point

i
didnt
realize
this
guy
was
that
high
man
these
guys
are
the
king
of
disguising
the
booze
overall
outstanding
very
tasty
barrel
aged
ebw
definitely
a
sipper
many
thanks
to
abanton
for
the
opportunity
o
kuhnhenn
has
knocked
another
barrel
aged
brew
out
of
the
park
as
their
bbbw
is
top
shelf
they
seem
to
find
concentration
in
their
beers
that
ive
never
before
witnessed
and
its
a
marvel
to
behold
big
thumbs
up
from
rhettroactive
this
is
delicious
stuff
as
a
few
others
have
said
the
heat
keeps
this
a
step
down
from
the
4ds
but
its
pretty
solid
worth
grabbing
just
grab
2
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
another
great
barleywine
from
kuhnhenn
while
i
dont
think
this
is
as
good
as
4d
and
bb4d
i
thought
it
was
a
ton
better
than
their
american
barleywine
great
nose
and
i
bet
with
some
time
on
it
this
could
become
a
world
class
bba
barleywine
would
love
to
have
again
great
notes
of
toffee
and
warming
bourbon
not
boozey
at
all
which
is
a
feat
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
trade
for
this
if
you
can
it
will
not
disappoint
o
there
are
better
barrelaged
barleywines
out
there
but
not
many
this
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
likes
of
king
henry
or
mother
of
all
storms
but
few
things
do
on
its
own
kuhnhenn
bb
barleywine
is
a
good
example
of
quality
barrel
aging
elevating
what
is
likely
a
fairly
pedestrian
base
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
age
the
other
to
see
what
time
does
here
like
each
of
the
few
brews
ive
had
from
kuhnhenn
brewing
its
a
nice
novelty
strongly
sweet
bear
of
a
beer
do
they
make
a
pale
ale
i
respect
going
big
and
i
seek
out
the
barrelly
influenced
bourbon
on
the
taste
here
is
nearly
an
afterthought
but
im
still
uncertain
about
these
liquids
from
warren
mi
gosh
there
are
so
many
beers
from
mi
incremazing
brilliant
smooth
flavors
and
an
amazing
balance
between
citrusy
barleywine
notes
and
barrelaging
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
ba
barleywine
ive
ever
had
and
a
permawant
has
been
set
o
the
standard
kuhnhenn
barley
wine
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
didnt
think
it
could
really
be
improved
upon
i
was
horribly
mistaken
i
want
to
age
this
to
see
if
it
gets
even
better
but
im
skeptical
fantastic
beer
as
it
stands
and
perfect
for
a
cold
winter
night
pours
a
dark
but
brilliant
garnet
shade
of
dark
red
with
the
scantest
of
heads
despite
a
straight
down
the
middle
pour
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
incredible
lush
cocoa
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
intermixed
with
a
lovely
touch
of
the
bourbon
barrel
treatment
this
is
a
damn
tasty
barley
wine
ill
say
that
right
now
this
is
rich
in
the
aforementioned
flavors
its
awesome
when
a
beers
nose
and
taste
align
this
well
its
damn
near
perfect
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
with
a
sweet
finish
thats
rounded
off
perfectly
by
the
bourbon
i
cant
believe
for
the
life
of
me
that
this
is
14
5
abv
where
is
it
i
cant
find
it
theres
booziness
to
it
but
nothing
about
this
beer
screams
out
that
its
this
goddam
big
overall
this
isnt
just
a
home
run
but
a
grand
slam
twice
over
im
permanently
in
search
of
this
for
like
forever
d
and
o
man
just
a
great
english
barleywine
really
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
and
extremely
enjoyable
fantastically
balanced
well
rounded
very
deep
amount
of
flavor
o
a
pretty
decent
beer
its
very
sweet
and
sticky
with
a
significant
alcohol
presence
but
still
tasty
enough
definitely
a
beer
to
be
drank
in
small
quantities
tip
of
the
hat
to
abraxel
for
another
tasty
bottle
and
hitting
a
want
sweet
overall
this
was
a
very
solid
drink
the
serving
size
of
this
is
quite
generous
as
well
i
could
happily
share
one
of
these
bottles
with
somebody
else
and
still
get
my
fill
the
alcohol
definitely
is
enough
to
keep
you
sipping
at
this
one
but
i
didnt
think
that
it
interfered
with
the
drinkability
as
long
as
you
slow
down
and
respect
it
o
very
impressed
with
this
the
bourbon
is
fantastic
im
not
a
fan
of
over
the
top
sweetness
and
this
beer
does
a
great
job
at
not
becoming
overpowering
while
still
offering
a
very
rich
flavour
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
amount
of
froth
at
the
sides
of
the
glass
slightly
translucent
smells
of
bourbon
alcohol
molasses
and
caramel
i
taste
bourbon
dark
fruits
slight
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
very
sweet
tasting
at
the
end
of
the
sip
i
cant
believe
that
this
is
14
5
as
its
noticeable
but
not
overbearing
full
bodied
beer
that
is
slick
and
oily
as
its
drank
overall
im
glad
that
i
didnt
age
this
because
i
think
its
quite
drinkable
now
i
now
wish
i
bought
a
second
bottle
to
age
but
at
7
a
bottle
i
was
a
little
reluctant
to
buy
two
if
you
like
bourbon
this
one
is
for
you
o
fantastic
beer
extremely
well
made
with
no
apparent
flaws
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
residual
sweetness
but
this
is
a
stellar
barleywine
12oz

of

2010
vintage
served
in
my
old
stock
snifter
pours
a
translucent
mahogany
with
a
loose
halfinch
offwhite
head
that
quickly
disperses
towards
the
shoulders
forming
a
thin
bubbly
band
theres
also
a
residual
oily
slick
across
the
center
of
the
glass
nose
expresses
milk
chocolate
a
trace
of
dark
fruit
and
a
pleasant
buttery
vanilla
character
only
the
merest
suggestion
of
bourbon
presents
itself
taste
expresses
toffee
butter
candied
fruit
and
a
slightly
acrid
ethanol
character
that
lingers
at
the
back
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
but
closer
to
light
with
a
slightly
coarse
carbonation
and
quite
a
bit
of
residual
heat
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
and
at
the
back
of
the
throat
all
and
all
a
pretty
good
barleywine
that
could
use
some
time
to
allow
that
alcohol
presence
to
dissipate
that
said
if
the
alcohol
does
in
fact
dissipate
the
thinness
to
the
body
would
be
more
prominent
im
not
sure
if
a
lot
of
age
will
improve
this
beer
but
another
year
in
the
cellar
might
reveal
a
decent
balance
overall
this
is
a
very
good
bourbon
barrel
barley
wine
the
taste
is
quite
good
but
the
dustiness
on
the
nose
is
a
bit
odd
though
overall
this
is
another
great
kuhnhenn
offering
but
it
needs
more
time
in
the
cellar
when
the
heat
dies
it
will
be
out
of
this
world
its
a
great
nightcap
for
a
cool
night
just
like
this
evening
in
illinois
very
nice
in
the
mood
for
a
barleywine
tonight
and
this
really
fit
the
bill
fantastic
barrel
integration
here
fantastic
sweet
malt
interplay
with
the
barrel
and
borubon
character
absolute
magic
phenomenal
when
it
hits

temperature

d
after
the
aroma
i
was
expecting
great
things
and
ive
rarely
been
let
down
by
kuhnhenn
but
things
just
didnt
quite
add
up
a
decent
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
a
cloudy
reddish
copper
color
with
only
a
wisp
of
light
stone
colored
film
which
mostly
fizzles
out
by
the
time
youve
set
the
bottle
down
apple
and
caramel
are
at
the
forefront
of
the
nose
along
with
sweet
malt
nuttiness
cherry
vanilla
whipped
cream
but
finally
a
slightly
harsh
solvent
and
alcohol
aroma
at
the
end
the
smell
is
wonderfully
complex
but
the
alcohol
harshness
definitely
detracts
from
it
for
me
tastes
like
caramel
malt
and
cherry
with
some
dry
oakiness
and
a
dry
finish
which
again
features
alcohol
prominently
and
a
slightly
off
flavor
that
i
cant
place
im
not
picking
up
any
of
the
bourbon
flavors
here
or
on
the
nose
carbonation
is
pretty
low
but
supports
the
surprisingly
mediumlight
body
just
fine
slightly
tannic
overall
this
smells
quite
good
tastes
pretty
good
but
the
alcohol
presence
is
a
little
much
and
unfortunately
the
bourbon
is
mia
it
tasted
good
enough
but
im
not
sure
id
reach
for
it
regularly
bottle
poured
a
deep
amber
color
ale
with
a
very
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
bourbon
with
distinctive
vanilla
notes
is
quite
powerful
with
some
deep
caramelized
sugar
notes
and
lingering
sweetness
taste
is
also
a
very
interesting
mix
between
some
deep
bourbon
notes
with
some
balanced
vanilla
and
sweet
malt
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
this
one
is
a
sipper
and
i
could
not
consume
vast
quantities
at
the
same
time
overall
honestly
this
didnt
live
up
to
my
hopesexpectations
this
one
definitely
needs
time
to
mellow
i
love
how
the
base
beer
hits
all
of
my
favorite
barleywinestrong
ale
sweet
spots
but
the
alcohol
needs
to
soften
before
this
is
can
be
considered
exceptional
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
fantastic
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
i
think
the
alcohol
is
over
bearing
at
first
but
the
taste
gets
better
as
it
warms
the
slight
oxidation
is
moderately
off
putting
but
thats
the
only
real
strike
against
this
beer
the
initial
carbonation
dies
down
fairly
quickly
and
really
lets
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
bounce
off
of
eachother
nicely
complex
warming
and
aggressively
flavored
would
love
to
have
a
few
to
sit
on
for
a
while
longer
o
wow
thats
a
big
glass
im
warming
up
to
it
as
it
warms
but
this
is
just
too
overpowering
without
enough
complexity
to
match
the
booze
this
would
definitely
be
a
better
beer
at
the
end
of
the
night
but
i
guess
ill
enjoy
an
afternoon
nap
instead
overall
an
excellent
beer
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
pours
a
very
pretty
reddish
maroon
a
bit
of
white
head
around
the
edges
very
good
looking
beer
smells
a
bit
oxidied
but
very
nice
a
touch
of
bourbon
on
the
nose
but
the
oxidized
aromas
tastes
sweet
but
dry
roasty
and
bourbon
heavy
the
malts
are
oxidized
but
still
nice
overall
solid
but
disappointing
with
regards
to
the
oxidation
ah
take
a
sip
and
you
will
want
to
sip
this
every
night
its
like
a
very
refined
and
gentle
bourbon
so
gentle
with
alot
of
warmth
notes
of
brown
sugar
incorporate
with
the
bourbon
and
vanilla
and
create
the
best
15
beer
i
think
i
have
ever
had
holy
crap
this
is
really
really
good
stuff
this
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
foam
that
was
coarse
and
probably
not
meant
to
really
be
there
im
trying
to
figure
out
what
best
describes
ambrosia
but
i
cant
do
it
justice
but
thats
close
to
what
this
beer
smells
like
there
is
rich
caramel
and
figs
and
raisin
oh
so
good
this
might
have
been
the
best
thing
if
wed
cracked
it
out
at
our
bwine
tasting
for
a
2010
vintage
this
could
still
use
some
time
to
mellow
out
the
high
amount
of
alcohol
which
actually
doesnt
come
across
too
strongly
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
wish
to
bathe
in
it
in
the
future
overall
this
was
a
pleasure
to
sample
for
what
it
is
its
fantastic
w
excellent
complexity
and
depth
age
will
only
make
this
one
better
however
for
me
the
15
1
abv
and
strong
bourbon
character
were
too
much
for
me
as
i
really
struggled
to
finish
my
12oz
glass
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
very
good
2010
vintage
the
final
beer
this
evening
a
sort
of
leftover
from
our
last
major
tasting
i
love
having
plenty
of
good
bottles
around
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
short
lived
halffinger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
toffee
bourbon
and
light
vanilla
its
rather
simple
but
pretty
tasty
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
light
oak
and
some
additional
toffee
damn
good
stuff
here
especially
with
the
alcohol
being
almost
completely
masked
the
body
is
a
heftyfeeling
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thickly
slick
feel
overall
a
beer
worthy
of
the
hype
it
receives
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
very
much
d
i
have
mixed
feelings
with
this
beer
it
looked
great
and
i
enjoy
the
flavor
it
offers
but
it
very
much
oozes
bourbon
heat
from
every
molecule
its
definitely
a
sipper
if
there
ever
was
one
i
did
enjoy
it
however
but
i
definitely
took
my
time
and
savored
it
over
a
few
hours
i
do
look
forward
to
seeing
what
a
few
years
of
time
will
do
to
this
this
is
a
fantastic
barleywine
that
has
been
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
brilliant
do
this
is
pretty
good
and
while
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
that
wont
stop
me
from
drinking
more
of
this
i
look
forward
to
how
my
other
bottle
ages
over
the
next
year
cheers
pours
a
real
reddish
amber
with
virtually
no
head
maybe
a
tiny
tan
ring
looks
bourbon
barrel
aged
nose
is
a
caramel
dark
fruit
booze
bomb
i
dont
get
much
barrel
or
vanilla
but
i
get
straight
alcohol
there
is
just
enough
sweetness
in
the
nose
to
not
make
this
offensive
taste
is
mega
booze
dark
fruit
caramel
generic
sweetness
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
this
isnt
pulling
strongly
positive
qualities
out
of
the
barrel
in
the
same
way
that
a
good
barrelaged
imperial
stout
lays
a
canvas
for
the
barrelaging
that
being
said
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
could
use
some
time
not
as
good
as
moas
was
fresh
neither
was
as
good
as
they
will
become
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
and
picks
up
some
carbonation
though
it
is
low
drinkability
well
this
beer
is
almost
15
which
is
crazy
and
yet
isnt
offensively
boozy
that
being
said
it
is
pretty
darn
boozy
and
doesnt
try
to
hide
it
i
will
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
that
despite
my
willingness
to
call
a
strong
beer
very
drinkable
this
one
is
not
so
much
much
like
fresh
moas
2
years
could
make
this
beer
an
a
ok
i
knew
this
was
an
a
beer
after
the
second
sip
this
along
with
the
perfect
storm
are
the
pinnacle
of
barrelaged
barleywines
absolutely
fantastic
borderline
perfect
im
delighted
i
have
a
few
more
in
the
basement
epic
beer
damn
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
has
rich
malts
caramel
toffee
ripe
pitted
fruits
oak
vanilla
and
bourbon
taste
has
similar
profile
except
for
a
subtle
tart
cherry
presence
medium
body
drinks
well
d
palate
killer
and
equivalent
to
almost
3
beers
in
alcohol
definitely
not
a
session
beer
the
palate
opens
rather
monstrous
big
boozy
hot
and
sweet
a
friend
of
mine
once
commented
that
he
likes
his
barleywines
like
he
likes
his
women
hot
boozy
messes
well
this
definitely
does
fit
the
bill
brown
sugar
maple
syrup
a
little
toffee
are
present
on
the
malt
front
but
in
all
honesty
this
is
almost
entirely
about
the
barrels
hot
bourbony
almost
alcoholic
burn
are
present
and
it
is
quite
fitting
on
this
rainy
latewinter
night
tannins
appear
lingering
on
into
the
finish
this
does
add
a
light
nutty
character
vanilla
is
moderate
but
theres
some
honey
light
and
fruity
full
in
body
with
soft
creamy
carbonation
this
does
beer
does
feel
very
smooth
on
the
palate
dark
fruit
character
is
quite
light
this
is
more
along
the
lines
of
a
young
jw
lees
warming
this
is
great
stuff
though
not
the
most
drinkable
d
although
the
alcohol
is
apparent
it
is
only
warming
sweet
and
rich
very
tasty
the
more
i
get
into
it
the
more
i
enjoy
it
highly
recommended
d
i
think
this
will
be
a
far
superior
beer
with
some
age
on
it
that
said
this
is
quite
a
solid
offering
from
kuhnhenn
such
a
smooth
beer
for
the
high
abv
the
nice
little
bit
of
bourbon
heat
adds
nicely
and
i
really
dig
it
2010
bottle
pours
a
clear
plumorange
with
a
thin
ring
around
the
edges
nose
is
wonderful
thick
malt
spicy
oak
a
nicely
weaved
sweet
bourbon
and
a
vinous
note
with
plums
raisins
flavor
begins
with
sweet
brown
sugar
and
a
light
hop
note
then
rolls
into
the
oak
dry
and
spciy
and
the
bourbon
i
like
the
marriage
of
base
beer
and
bourbon
barrel
here
not
so
overt
but
powerful
nicely
done
there
are
some
faults
here
as
the
booze
is
a
bit
heavy
on
the
finish
and
theres
kind
of
a
hole
in
the
back
palate
in
style
this
is
akin
to
wooden
hell
in
a
way
but
its
not
as
nicely
realized
d
definitely
a
good
beer
my
first
from
the
legendary
kuhnhenn
definitely
has
its
good
points
i
would
love
to
see
where
this
is
fresh
light
carbonation
decent
body
but
who
cares
the
massive
flavors
are
the
draw
here
i
think
this
could
definitely
benefit
from
a
few
years
of
mellowing
d
super
easy
to
drink
at
15

what
this
batch
says
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
great
beer
but
having
had
an
earlier
version
not
nearly
as
good
or
complex
maybe
it
just
needs
a
bit
of
time
very
tasty
but
intense
d
this
is
too
powerful
and
with
too
strong
a
taste
of
alcohol
let
alone
the
effect
of
it
to
be
highly
drinkable
it
is
smooth
and
tasty
of
course
but
still
something
that
will
have
to
be
respected
and
not
drank
quickly
do
yourself
a
favor
and
track
this
down
if
this
beer
was
a
woman
well
you
know
d
a
great
beer
for
sharing
or
slowly
sipping
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
perfect
for
a
rainy
wintry
day
the
taste
is
as
complex
as
the
aroma
in
my
opinion
with
the
exception
that
the
taste
has
more
oak
in
it
than
the
aroma
maybe
i
just
missed
the
oak
but
it
is
present
in
the
taste
lead
off
is
sweetness
with
the
stone
fruits
and
raisins
to
follow
beer
is
lighter
in
body
than
i
expected
and
finishes
a
little
dry
a
good
beer
overall
d
big
aroma
and
flavor
balanced
enough
for
a
barreled
barleywine
but
skewed
well
toward
sugariness
a
wonderful
sipper
thatd
be
a
treat
to
have
again
just
like
it
was
a
treat
to
have
tonight
great
job
kuhnhenn
and
thanks
again
derek
d
theres
no
real
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
but
theres
a
warming
sensation
that
goes
down
my
throat
and
into
my
stomach
as
i
drink
this
beer
perfect
for
a
winter
night
with
the
excellent
taste
and
feel
this
has
dangerous
drinkability
d
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
notably
what
sets
this
apart
from
the
best
in
its
class
is
that
lack
of
richness
and
integration
of
flavor
this
ones
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
and
all
the
ingredients
dont
seem
to
have
melded
with
one
another
yet
balaging
also
seems
to
imparted
a
bit
too
much
heat
still
a
very
good
beer
and
im
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
d
very
good
and
a
great
bbbw
i
wish
i
had
more
typical
taste
and
feel
of
a
kuhnhenn
brew
which
is
never
bad
must
get
more
a
very
nicely
done
bourbonaged
beer
that
i
am
very
happy
i
got
to
try
beers
really
dont
get
much
better
than
this
the
bourbon
and
vanilla
character
is
very
well
done
and
just
adds
a
layer
of
complexity
to
the
rich
malt
backbone
instead
of
taking
the
lead
role
like
so
many
barrel
aged
beers
do
tastes
almost
identical
to
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
acidity
and
warmth
in
the
mouth
and
chest
love
english
style
barley
wines
and
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
very
sweet
but
not
cloying
the
epitome
of
an
after
dinnerdessert
beer
d
id
definitely
say
that
there
is
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
i
want
more
even
and
would
put
away
two
in
a
night
i
cant
believe
it
is
14

2010
version
unreal
aroma
that
is
dr
pepper
mixed
with
pure
malt
awesome
still
too
young
and
raw
to
really
call
this
world
class
i
can
definitely
see
though
why
the
aged
2005
vintage
is
so
highly
sought
after
let
some
of
that
heat
mellow
off
and
this
stuff
will
be
outstanding
in
a
couple
of
years
im
going
to
have
to
seek
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
out
kuhnhenns
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
was
something
i
sought
out
for
a
long
long
time
i
had
high
expectations
and
theyve
mostly
been
met
this
is
a
fantastic
barrelaged
barleywine
i
dont
know
how
long
it
was
in
barrels
but
it
was
the
perfect
amount
of
time
the
bourbon
flavor
is
spoton
and
works
perfectly
the
only
qualms
i
have
are
perhaps
too
few
bubbles
and
a
little
too
much
alcohol
small
gripes
this
is
fantastic
beer
seek
it
out
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barrelaged
barley
wine
but
i
think
that
it
has
fallen
off
a
bit
since
the
first
bottle
that
i
opened
and
when
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
this
past
winter
all
in
all
man
this
one
started
good
and
went
downhill
from
there
this
is
like
drinking
straight
hard
liquor
im
not
even
sure
if
age
would
help
settle
this
one
down
enough
to
improve
it
this
to
me
is
not
a
good
example
of
a
good
barleywine
strong
barleywine
yes
not
too
complex
because
all
of
the
flavors
are
buried
by
the
liquor
id
say
that
this
one
was
definitely
not
worth
hunting
down
dont
bother
here
you
will
trade
a
lot
and
get
a
little
only
try
once
if
you
have
access
otherwise
dont
bother
thanks
to
stopbarking
for
this
one
as
a
bonus
very
generous
of
you

decent

the
flavor
cranks
up
the
booziness
and
thankfully
shows
off
more
of
that
signature
bourbon
heat
that
kuhnhenn
does
so
well
with
their
barrelaged
beers
a
bit
medicinal
at
times
but
the
buttery
presence
is
nearly
nonexistent
on
the
tongue
body
feels
sticky
and
chewy
with
a
hot
syrupy
finish
still
surprisingly
smooth
for
the
abv
the
bbbw
is
the
first
real
miss
ive
had
from
kuhnhenn
the
buttery
aroma
was
distracting
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
verging
on
a
hot
mess
not
something
id
look
for
again
but
this
brewerys
track
record
is
impressive
enough
for
me
to
want
to
try
every
last
beer
they
produce
big
thanks
to
masterski
for
tossing
me
this
bottle
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
but
it
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
maybe
the
batches
vary
maybe
i
shouldve
let
this
cellar
a
bit
longer
overall
both
were
great
but
the
aged
version
was
really
special
extremely
drinkable
for
the
abv
really
enjoyed
this
one
or
these
ones
pouring
heartily
right
into
the
center
of
the
glass
yields
close
to
zero

cant

more

betrays
the
bourbon
immediately
but
thankfully
not
the

burn
vanilla
butterscotch
dutch

leap
to
the

these
come

a

of
banana
peach
and
maraschino
cherry
fruit
scents
underneath
lies
a
subtle
lactose
funkiness
fullbodied
without
seeming
heavy
the
density
comes
mostly
from
the
strong
bourbon
character
as
well
as
here
the
alcoholic
burn
vanilla
butterscotch
caramel
comes
with
a
little
licorice
ginger
root
clamps
down
a
little
too
hard
to
give
free

to
the
orange

apricot
peach
cherry
banana
fruit
ends
on
a
drying
note
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
inactive
but
whats
there
is
fluffy
like
a
cotton
ball
for
its
type
good
drinkability
but
i
would
still
characterize
it
as
along
the
lines
of
a
dessert
beer
1209
vintage
overall
a
damn
fine
ba
bwine
a
little
hot
but
still
very
well
done
i
dont
really
mind
the
small
amount
of
heat
for
the
style
they
tops
many
ba
bwines
i
have
had
i
really
want
more
obviously
a
world
class
beer
one
i
will
probably
never
get
to
try
again
the
beer
exceeds
the
hype
on
this
one
if
you
dont
like
this
beer
then
ba
barleywines
just
arent
for
you
as
this
is
the
top
of
its
class

for
this
once
in
a
lifetime
chance
j
d

of
this
world
world
class
beer
kuhnhenn
does
it
again
d
ive
managed
to
drink
an
entire
12oz
bottle
of
this
beer
both
the
09
and
05
on
a
few
separate
occasions
its
a
slow
sipper
but
never
becomes
a
chore
the
tannic
and
oaky
flavors
become
a
bit
tiring
but
otherwise
its
about
as
drinkable
as
a
14
5
beer
can
be
i
think
i
like
abacus
more
but
this
is
still
quite
excellent
the
abv
and
the
price
gave
me
pause
but
if
you
can
stand
the
heat
this
is
well
worth
tracking
down
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
worth
the
effort
to
track
down
if
you
arent
afraid
of
the
sweeter
side
of
the

only

can
take
into

ridiculously
high

and

the

drinkable
14
5
brew
ive
ever
had
an
amazingly
mature
brew
for
two
reasons
first
the
alcohol
heat
is
incredibly
tame
for
its
numerical
equivalent
and
second
the
flavors
are
incredibly
wellblendedbalanced
for
the
age
of
this
beer
with
everything
complimenting
and
mingling
with
everything
else
in
a
way
that
you
usually
only
see
in
a
beer
of
this
size
at
an
age
four
times
this
ones
age
a
must
have
for
barleywine
fans
and
im
confident
wooden
hell
aint
got
shit
on
this
beauty
seek
it
out
if
you
can
you
wont
be
disappointed
i
probably
enjoyed
drinking
this
a
lot
more
than
the
score
would
indicate
but
to
be
fair
its
got
some
problems
that
perhaps
only
time
in
the
bottle
will
sort
out
d
while
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
heat
to
this
beer
i
still
really
enjoyed
the
flavors
i
think
the
vanilla
and
chocolate
oxidation
flavors
go
nicely
with
the
barleywine
base
perhaps
it
would
have
been
good
to
let
this
age
for
a
bit
but
its
still
enjoyable
fresh
d
a
few
sips
is
good
anything
more
and
the
heavy
pricetag
kicks
you
square
between
the
eyes
a
full
maltcentric
barleywine
if
ever
ive
had
one
kuhnhenns
bourbon
barrel
barley
wine
is
an
enjoyable
albeit
potent
barrel
aged
barleywine
i
like
a
high
level
of
alcohol
heat
in
beers
of
this
style
but
this
became
a
bit
distracting
and
detracting
if
the
alcohol
abates
with
age
and
precluding
an
infection
in
the
bottles
i
daresay
this
will
be
great
bourbon
is
unsurprisingly
dominant
on
the
palate
but
theres
a
huge
malt
backbone
to
support
the
strong
barrel
character
sweeter
notes
of
caramel
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
are
nicely
balanced
by
the
woody
tannins
and
sharp
alcohol
fullbodied
syrupy
and
perhaps
a
bit
too
boozy
but
still
thoroughly
enjoyable
the
finish
is
biting
and
hot
but
not
unpleasantly
so
though
those
that
dislike
a
noticeable
heat
in
their
beer
may
find
this
harsh
d
its
quite
good
and
well
deserving
of
its
place
in
the
top
100
imo
having
recently
had
alpine
great
however
i
find
that
this
falls
just
short
of
the
quality
of
that
one
in
the
bourbonbarrel
barleywine
category
very
hot
and
extremely
boozy
with
a
ton
of
bourbon
that
dominates
the
flavor
and
lingers
into
a
long
warm
finish
subtle
vanilla
from
the
barrel
along
with
some
slick
caramel
toffee
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
namely
fig
date
and
raisin
a
bit
too
hot
and
bourbony
and
not
as
well
balanced
as
i
prefer
but
its
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
that
should
be
savoured
slowly
d
after
a
few
sips
i
already
started
feeling
it
but
it
is
not
super
thick
and
i
felt
it
was
easier
to
drink
than
the
listed
abv
tastes
almond
chocolate
nutty
cherry
sour
rounded
vanilla
and
a
strong
drying
wood
character
with
a
strange
waxy
component
strong
but
very
clean
alcohol
caramel
and
prune
way
beneath
and
found
only
with
searching
dominated
by
the
wood
and
bourbon
with
too
much
alcohol
to
allow
the
malt
to
show
through
its
potent
like
in
a
quality
cognac
mouthfeel
is
mdthin
and
drinkability
is
sure
to
improve
there
is
so
much
potential
here
i
wish
i
could
taste
the
2005
right
now
to
see
what
this
one
will
be
like
when
i
eventually
crack
my
second
bottle
a
few
years
down
the
line
impressive
beer
d
very
very
drinkable
it
was
quite
sad
running
out
of
this
and
i
would
absolutely
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
to
see
what
a
few
years
does
to
this
one
as
it
is
im
quite
glad
we
were
lucky
enough
to
catch
this
one
in
timeprops
to
my
parents
for
deciding
to
move
to
mi
and
give
my
wife
and
i
an
excuse
to
stop
by
and
try
this
one
out
really
really
good
beer
overall
i
have
a
few
bottles
of
the
2005
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
to
see
what
this
might
evolve
into
over
time
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
perfect
storm
but

rich

rum
raisin
bread
a
little

vanilla
and
a
strong
oaky
finish
with
lots
of

this
really
drinks
a
nice
mellow
bourbon
instead
of
an
assertive
barley
wine
the
body
is
full
and
velvety
with
low
carbonation
and
a
kick
of
alcohol
warming
after
you
swallow
a
sip
i
wouldnt
really
try
to
pair
this
with
anything
but
it
make
a
great
aperitif
after
a
nice
steak
dinner
enjoyed
a
few
glasses
of
this
with
joeyschlitz
on
tap
at
kuhnhenn
last
night
fantastic
stuff
served
too
cold
in
a
snifter
glass
this
poured
hazy
caramel
without
much
head
at
first
i
wasnt
very
impressed
by
this
beer
but
once
it
warmed
to
a
proper
temperature
it
was
great
smells
and
tastes
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
goodness
with
woody
caramel
toffee
and
vanilla
notes
as
pretty
much
every
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
does
but
where
this
really
shined
in
my
view
is
the
simple
fact
that
it
is
so
well
done
clean
polished
not
too
much
bourbon
not
too
sweet
not
too
thick
or
thin
everything
is
just
right
and
its
really
high
in
alcohol
joeyschlitz
and
i
were
pretty
tipsy
upon
leaving
kuhnhenn
last
night
great
stuff
das
good
as
advertised
this
is
a
bba
malt
lovers
dream
nicely
done
but
i
think
the
sweetness
and
abv
would
slow
me
down
in
the
end
pours
murky
muddy
brown
with
large
bubbled
brown
head
the
nose
is
huge
with
loads
of
toffee
hops
and
oak
the
flavor
is
a
fantastic
blend
of
toffee
and
booze
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
very
drinkable
the
heat
from
the
booze
lingers
just
for
a
bit
this
is
a
damn
fine
barleywine
and
one
that
ive
been
looking
to
try
for
a
while
i
got
hints
of
oxidation
in
the
taste
but
thats
really
just
nitpicking
with
such
a
great
beer
purchased
at
the
brewery
summer
2007
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
the
aroma
can
be
detected
from
across
the
room
there
is
a
great
play
between
dark
fruity
goodness
sweet
caramel
hints
of
alcohol
and
woody
bourbonness
the
flavor
is
a
sweet
kiss
on
the
lips
with
figs
dates
minced
raisins
soaking
in
molasses
and
an
absolutely
delicious
river
of
caramel
candy
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
does
show
up
around
the
finish
competing
with
the
barleywine
flavors
but
a
couple
notches
below
in
strength
is
a
bourbon
and
wood
sensation
very
nice
compliment
creating
an
enjoyable
experience
the
after
taste
is
a
mix
of
dark
fruit
caramel
and
hints
of
wood
the
only
knock
i
could
find
would
be
the
body
its
a
bit
too
thin
sure
hope
they
plan
on
making
more
this
next
winter
poured
a
brownish
amber
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
left
light
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
raisins
tobacco
smoke
vanilla
bourbon
nutmeg
a
bit
of
oatmeal
char
and
alcohol
as
well
taste
of
more
caramel
malts
cherry
bourbon
raisins
citrus
fruits
light
nutmeg
dried
fruits
chocolate
and
alcohol
as
well
in
the
finish
notes
from
and
tasted
on
7307
a
solid
barleywine
that
exhibits
a
good
barrel
character
but
not
the
best
example
ive
had
this
was
for
sure
on
my
top
three
beers
to
try
list
and
the
fact
that
they
were
only
one
hundred
bottles
ever
produced
made
it
look
like
i
might
not
get
to
try
it
luckily
i
did
going
out
on
a
limb
here
and
saying
that
this
is
the
best
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
i
think
this
was
a
2006
vintage
but
i
am
sure
this
would
hold
up
for
another
decade
would
love
to
drink
this
again
but
not
likely
cannot
recommend
this
enough
such
a
smooth
beer
for
14
5
my
only
complaint
would
be
that
the
finish
is
a
tad
too
sweet
still
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
so
far
i
easily
took
2025min
finishing
off
my
sample
of
this
i
just
didnt
want
it
to
be
over
overall
wow
this
was
worth
the
search
and
deserving
of
the
appraise
that
it
gets
it
was
a
whole
new
level
of
barley
wine
for
me
this
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
it
to
be
exactly
what
it
needed
to
be
a
fantastic
brew
that
literally
blew
me
away
i
would
love
to
get
this
one
again
but
i
know
it
wont
happen
still
though
wow
a
big
big
thanks
goes
out
to
grub
for
the
chance
to
try
this
most
excellent
brew
d
this
is
another
out
of
the
park
brew
by
kuhnhenn
i
truly
hope
they
produce
more
so
i
have
another
chance
to
drink
this
one
the
main
thing
i
truly
loved
about
this
one
was
the
balance
it
was
huge
yet
seemed
to
balance
the
alcohol
perfectly
with
rich
sweetness
that
a
lot
of
other
extreme
brews
fail
to
do
totally
lives
up
to
the
hype
in
my
opinion
although
there
probably
arent
many
bottles
left
in
circulation
if
you
have
a
chance
trade
whatever
you
can
for
this
one
6
for
a
wine
glass
serving
at
spuyten
duyvil
in
brooklyn
ny
apparently
it
was
illegally
trucked
in
by
an
anonymous
individual
well
kudos
to
that
individual
and
to
the
folks
here
for
letting
us
in
on
the
secret
pretty
sure
when
this
one
is
kicked
thats
it
by
far
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
ive
had
with
the
bourbon
barrel
in
no
way
overpowering
the
original
flavors
of
the
beer
so
id
clearly
recommend
getting
over
to
try
it
out
and
of
course
this
is
privileged
info
to
be
kept
between
you
and
me
and
any
one
else
who
would
use
the
knowledge
for
good
pours
with
very
little
carbonation
smells
of
bourbon
vanilla
alcohol
taste
is
big
and
complex
lots
going
on
here
malty
sweetness
bourbon
vanilla
date
plums
its
a
constant
discovery
severy
sip
mouthfeel
seemed
a
bit
thin
at
first
but
as
you
sip
it
grows
nicely
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
gets
better
with
every
sip
holy
macaroni
kuhnhenn
bourbon
barrel
barley
wine
is
among
if
not
the
best
crafted
beer
ive
tried
the
precision
of
detail
and
particularities
the
depth
of
flavour
the
sensible
use
of
barrel
aging
the
sheer
quality
its
a
downright
divine
drink
while
other
brewers
may
write
music
kuhnhenn
writes
symphonies
this
was
something
beautiful
thanks
grub
drinkability
is
exceptional
very
well
balanced
definitely
doesnt
taste

dark

with
amber
highlights
a
great
soapy
white
head
very
fresh
tasting
vanilla
and
caramel
a
very
good
bourbon
barrel
effort
and
a
great
matchup
of
barleywine
14
5
was
extreme
and
it
was
a
good
thing
this
was
my
last
beer
of
the
night
had
the
2010
and
was
good
though
not
best
great
aroma
though
coconut
dominated
taste
an
incredibly
mellow
brew
the
main
flavor
and
aroma
i
got
pineapple
hops
the
malt
profile
was
a
little
too
mellow
but
there
was
no
trace
of
alcohol
it
was
just
a
smooth
sipper
at
the
end
i
got
some
vanilla
flavor
but
really
the
pineapple
dominated
12er
what
nectar
dark
brown
color
outstanding
aroma
astonishingly
complex
flavor
of
absorbed
wood
coconut
vanilla
soaked
wood
light
whiskey
and
heavy
malt
an
array
of
cinnamon
covered
fruit
caramel
and
toffee
very
very
smooth
if
anyone
has
any
bottles
of
this
for
trade
i
am
willing
to
trade
heavily
for
it
enjoyed
at
the
brewpub
clear
and
brown
with
reddish
highlights
the
yellowish
light
brown
head
showed
good
retention
given
the
gravity
and
fine
bubbles
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
throughout
what
a
beauty
aromas
of
toffee
vanilla
wood
light
citrus
and
mellow
alcohol
came
together
nicely
moderate
bitterness
that
barely
keeps
up
with
the
other
flavours
lots
of
toffee
and
caramel
vanilla
and
oak
hops
were
quite
citrusy
mostly
grapefruit
and
the
bourbon
character
melded
nicely
with
the
alcohol
flavour
and
warmth
in
the
finish
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
smooth
texture
with
a
bit
of
dryness
very
tasty
the
alcohol
was
really
well
hidden
given
the
strength
of
this
brew
making
for
an
easy
and
dangerous
drink
another
winner
from
kuhnhenn
pours
a
dark
amber
to
brown
and
clear
with
the
slightest
flash
of
some
cream
colored
carbonation
that
fades
back
in
an
instant
aroma
is
rich
sweet
maltiness
prunes
raisins
cherries
aged
overripe
fruit
and
coconutty
alcohol
nose
is
a
good
indicator
of
taste
here
as
the
beer
is
incredibly
rich
and
sweet
bourbon
comes
thru
in
the
taste
but
only
very
lightly
a
little
cola
flavor
is
evident
which
mixes
with
the
sweet
sugary
fruity
and
pruney
maltiness
there
is
alcohol
evident
in
the
taste
as
well
no
real
bite
just
a
nice
mellow
warmth
fairly
full
in
body
the
carbonation
is
definitely
low
as
evidenced
on
the
pour
there
is
a
nice
tingle
on
the
tongue
that
balances
the
sweetness
and
some
dryness
in
the
warming
finish
this
beer
was
absolutely
incredible
for
me
one
of
those
that
every
smell
was
as
good
as
the
first
and
every
taste
made
me
say
wow
a
nice
sweet
night
cap
and
even
though
the
alcohol
content
is
quite
high
i
savor
each
drop
and
know
i
could
definitely
drink
more
of
this
afternote
had
this
at
my
new
years
party
got
kinda
drunk
the
one
night
a
year
and
although
i
had
this
first
so
i
could
enjoy
it
unimpaired
i
found
one
last
sip
in
the
am
and
it
got
better
with
some
time
to
breathe
richer
and
smoother
did
a
tasting
of
4
beers
yesterday
evening
over
a
few
hour
span
this
was
the
first
brought
to
me
in
a
10
oz
tulip
the
color
is
gorgeous
deep
red
almost
like
blood
its
necessary
for
survival
and
a
small
tan
head
that
disspates
leaving
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
like
bourbon
of
course
caramel
chocolate
dark
fruitgrapes
no
messing
around
here
taste
is
sweet
almost
cloyingly
so
also
some
port
character
brown
sugar
bittersweet
chocolate
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
thick
rich
almost
chewy
with
some
little
carbonation
aside
from
the
sweetness
this
a
drinkable
bw
very
complex
highly
recommended
rustynail
brown
with
a
very
nice
espresso
coloured
head
that
makes
this
beer
look
absolutely
appealing
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
absolutely
amazing
i
smell
bourbon
soaked
dark
fruits
caramel
oak
vanilla
nice
malts
a
bit
of
roastiness
and
a
slight
hint
of
smokiness
also
come
through
wow
can
you
say
complex
the
taste
is
even
more
complex
with
the
alcoholic
dark
fruits
hitting
first
followed
by
the
luxurious
notes
of
oak
vanilla
carmelized
sugar
and
more
the
middle
is
sweet
and
dry
and
the
finish
is
warm
coating
and
wonderful
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
this
stuff
grabs
and
sticks
to
every
tastebud
on
your
tonuge
drinkability
is
excellent
for
a
barleywine
of
this
abv
and
i
beleive
that
this
is
only
a
2004
vintage
of
this
stuff
dryhopped
and
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
this
is
another
masterpiece
from
a
brewery
that
i
will
soon
visit
taste
starts
out
with
a
rich
blend
of
bourbon
soaked
plums
raisins
dates
and
overripe
fermenting
autumn
fruit
once
its
started
to
brown
and
fall
from
the
tree
to
be
beset
upon
by
bees
fruit
notes
taper
off
in
a
perfect
tartness
as
sweet
caramel
syrup
begins
to
drip
off
your
tongue
as
the
murky
malt
mixture
takes
over
in
the
middle
body
is
just
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
consistency
is
thick
enough
to
make
this
almost
a
meal
in
itself
chewy
and
delicious
finish
stokes
a
slowly
building
fire
out
of
smoldering
oak
logs
leaving
you
with
a
nice
warm
burn
and
bewilderment
as
to
how
they
packed
so
much
complex
flavor
in
this
amazing
creation
bourbon
is
present
throughout
this
beer
but
perfectly
complements
rather
than
dominates
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
drinks
dangerously
smooth
as
well
excellently
crafted
kuhnhenn
amazes
me
once
again
pours
to
a
murky
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
light
brown
head
that
leaves
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
unbelievable
dark
fruits
malty
sugars
candy
coated
raisins
and
dates
breads
nice
the
flavor
is
sweet
dates
and
raisins
with
candi
sugars
and
fruits
and
malts
and
and
i
cannot
do
this
beer
justice
it
is
so
easy
drinking
for
such
a
high
octane
damn
i
dont
want
it
to
end
thanks
stubob

this
boozing

wow
i
could
literally
copy
trbeers
review
for
this
word
for
word
and
feel
satisfied
with
the
review
i
too
had
this
at
the
polar
beer
fest
right
along
side
trbeer
this
was
such
a
drinkable
barleywine
that
it
blew
me
away
the
flavor
exploded
in
the
mouth
with
hints
of
spice
and
a
wonderful
buttery
flavor
present
an
outstanding
beer
kuhnhenn
im
in
love
overwhelming
smell
of
whiskey
but
the
taste
is
much
more
acceptable
i
dont
consider
myself
a
fan
of
the
barley
wine
but
this
is
the
1st
in
the
revolution
deep
woods
collection
i
thought
was
good
not
nearly
as
delicious
as
bourbon
county
barley
wine
this
is
one
worth
the
deep
woods
price
point
smells
sweeter
than
it
taste
has
a
beautiful
amber
hue
color
must
acquire
another
4
the
collection
all
of
those
caramelized
bourbon
oak
flavors
come
out
strong
on
this
beer
and
everything
locks
in
this
is
an
outstanding
barleywine
pretty
hot
needs
some
time
to
age
smell
doesnt
do
the
taste
justice

well

with
only

overall
this
is

all
around
great

and
very

on
for
the
huge
abv
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
i
really
liked
this
beer
the
flavor
starts
smooth
and
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
the
middle
tends
more
to
maple
syrup
molasses
and
brown
sugar
it
ends
with
a
literal
barley
wine
ie
barley
malt
and
fermented
grape
flavor
all
the
while
it
serves
smooth
and
thick
and
masks
the
13
very
nicely
picked
this
up
from
a
great
trade
with
evan
beautiful
mahoganyred
pour
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
that
quickly
fades
with
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
bold
and
oaky
with
huge
vanilla
and
sweet
caramel
malt
along
with
hints
of
bourbon
dark
fruit
toffee
brown
sugar
and
subtle
white
pepper
the
taste
is
even
bolder
with
huge
oaky
barrel
notes
along
with
hints
of
vanilla
bourbon
dark
fruits
molasses
coconut
brown
sugar
caramel
subtle

the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
light
carbonation
incredible
balance
and
a
nice
smooth
warming
finish
overall
this
a
bold
flavorful
and
hugely
drinkable
barley
wine
that
is
right
up
there
with
all
my
favorites
in
the
style
highly
recommended
bottle
this
is
straight
jacket
from
trade
pours
dark
amber
with
lots
of
reddish
color
and
a
beautiful
creamy
two

off
white

khaki
head
aroma
is
lots
of

bourbon
flavor
is
sweet
rich
caramel
covered
figs
with
brown
sugar
vanilla
tinged
of
dry
oak
the
bourbon
is
here
but
oh
so
smooth
with
very
little
evidence
of
the
13
abv
silky
smooth
and
thick
rich
body
with
low
plus
carbonation
man
this
is
really
good
and
apparently
my
trade
partner
grabbed
it
off
the
shelf
more
please
o
a
fine
example
of
how
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
process
should
go
down
the
nose
is
near
flawless
the
flavor
is
as
complex
as
my
last
cardiopulmonolgy
exam
and
the
body
is
just
so
damn
smooth
my
first
from
revolution
and
most
certainly
not
my
last
4
45
o
maybe
a
little
heavy
on
the
wood
aspect
but
with
such
a
heavymalt
brew
it
works
well
for
a
barleywine
this
is
nicely
complex
and
appropriately
alcoholed
revolutions
beers
do
not
disappoint
me
and
i
believe
this
is
one
of
their
best
offerings
to
me
it
has
all
of
the
characteristics
needed
in
an
english
bw
and
isnt
that
far
behind
the
very
best
of
them
such
as
sucaba
and
bcbbw
it
is
a
notch
or
two
below
just
because
of
depth
lack
therof
of
flavor
taste
its
more
expensive
than
sucaba
per
bottle
also
which
is
somewhat
frustrating
overall
good
but
not
really
my
style
a
bit
too
sweet
and
hot
for
my
tastes
cant
shake
the
thought
that
this
tastes
like
a
hard
cola
only
other
ba
barleywine
ive
had
was
the
fw
sucaba
hard
to
say
that
id
prefer
one
to
the
other
and
truth
is
id
probably
rather
have
a
well
crafted
bw
to
a
babw
any
day
of
the
week
straight
jacket
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
todays
sunshine
bringing
out
some
intense
red
notes
head
is
light
and
soapy
and
stays
in
place
around
the
ring
of
the
glass
aromas
are
intense
and
excellent
burnt
caramel
oaked
dark
fruit
and
lots
of
booze
going
in
for
a
sniff
never
gets
old
taste
is
sticky
sweet
vanilla
butterscotch
and
oaked
dates
some
nice
char
and
light
hops
that
work
against
the
very
pleasant
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
just
right
on
the
lighterthinner
side
but
substantial
enough
to
coat
the
palate
overall
i
could
pound
this
one
all
night
so
rich
and
tasty
from
the
taste
i
wouldve
thought
this
was
an
english
barley
wine
but
can
see
it
as
a
milder
central
waters
ba
barley
wine
in
terms
of
that
tart
happiness
i
like
in
the
american
style
ideal
drinking
environment
is
dead
of
winter
next
to
a
fireplace
but
a
sunny
porch
on
a
65
degree
late
afternoon
will
do
cheers
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
murky
chestnut
brown
with
no
sediment
and
a
thin
head
of
fine
carbonation
that
falls
off
quickly
with
light
lacing
the
nose
is
a
mix
of
molasses
raisin
bourbony
oak
that
finishes
with
a
hint
of
ethanol
and
vanilla
as
it
warms
similarly
the
taste
is
sticky
bourbon
barrel
goodness
bready
malts
well
integrated
bourbon
notes
minimal
bitternesshop
character
and
lingering
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
impressively
drinkable
with
a
mediumfull
slightly
flat
body
rich
bourbon
flavors
lingering
caramel
sweetness
minimal
bitterness
and
a
smooth
nonburning
boozy
finish
this
is
definitely
an
impressive
ba
barleywine
made
that
much
better
by
its
shelf
status
and
availability
man
i
wish
carbonation
had
made
even
a
cameo
here
the
heaviness
flatness
really
dulls
the
flavors
washes
out
what
i
suspect
is
an
awesome
beer
as
is
merely
decent
it
is
a
rich
brown
color
that
pours
quietly
yet
gives
a
small
head
top
as
you
smell
it
you
quickly
notice
a
hint
of
what
you
may
think
is
a
softer
bourbon
which
makes
it
very
unique
the
taste
that
follows
is
remarkably
smooth
complex
and
a
special
blend
of
brew
o
overall
this
is
a
superlative
barley
wine
and
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
this
beer
is
very
underrated
in
my
opinion
ive
had
some
good
barley
wines
recently
and
straight
jacket
beats
sucaba
and
behemoth
more
comparable
to
this
years
bourbon
county
brand
barley
wine
i
would
highly
recommend
grabbing
a
bomber
i
can
only
imagine
it
gets
better
with
age
o
this
is
a
very
good
brew
the
taste
is
sooo
good
i
think
it
would
taste
even
better
with
age
i
really
enjoyed
this
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
a
good
barrelaged
barleywine
i
love
finish
of
this
beer
as
mentioned
i
do
not
remember
ever
tasting
that
particular
characteristic
as
strong
in
other
barrel
aged
beers
maybe
i
will
get
another
bottle
to
age
reall
glad
i
have
a
bottle
to
age
this
will
do
great
things
im
sure
overall
its
a
really
strong
brew
a
well
executed
beer
with
some
great
potential
i
think
the
grain
bill
and
mix
will
yield
a
well
developed
barrel
aged
barely
wine
in
another
year
or
so
hold
on
to
this
one
with
age
will
come
promise
and
this
beer
has
promise
and
the
ability
to
follow
through
in
the
future
overall
very
tasty
great
barrel
everything
works
well
here
overall
a
solid
brew
for
sure
this
was
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
four
revolution
brews
i
sampled
recently
as
it
was
very
flavorful
well
balanced
and
had
a
full
creamy
feel
to
support
everything
that
was
going
on
something
i
would
gladly
drink
again
cheers
again
for
the
stuff
masterski
recommended
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
wood
and
bourbon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
brown
sugar
toffee
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
and
hop
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
great
bourbon
aromas
and
tasty
flavors
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
barleywine
and
ba
beer
in
my
book
i
havent
had
it
fresh
but
i
must
say
with
a
year
on
it
it
was
outstanding
definitely
going
to
seek
out
a
bottle
when
its
released
next
id
expect
in
jan
hopefully
i
wanted
to
savor
this
but
it
was
so
enjoyable
i
think
i
drank
it
too
fast
without
enough
to
enjoy
o
im
a
fan
not
sure
if
laying
it
down
for
almost
a
year
helped
or
not
but
i
love
bba
beers
and
this
fits
the
bill
o
one
of
the
best
bourbon
barrel
beers
i
have
ever
had
perfect
amounts
of
sweetness
and
flavor
all
around
a
great
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
worth
the
price
a
very
good
barrel
aged
barleywine
this
bottle
had
almost
one
year
on
it
which
may
have
mellowed
it
the
flavors
are
great
and
captures
the
essence
of
barrel
aging
would
definite
get
again
great
beer
good
to
combat
the
winter
cold
this
poured
as
a
very
nice
clear
brown
color
there
is
a
thin
white
hea
on
top
also
the
retention
is
thin
just
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
very
malty
some
bourbon
and
hops
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
with
loaded
of
malt
caramel
maple
and
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
gently
carbonated
a
slick
overall
its
a
very
nice
barley
wine
the
barrel
aging
isnt
over
the
top
but
still
very
good
woah
even
bigger
on
the
palate
the
big
maltbourbon
sweetness
hits
first
then
the
heat
surfaces
then
a
dry
and
sticky
finish
the
boozesoaked
oak
is
pretty
much
a
theme
through
and
through
honestly
this
one
tastes
even
boozier
than
13
are
they
just
saying
that
in
order
to
appease
those
pussies
in
ohio
o
lovely
bourbon
is
extraordinary
frothy
level
was
great
aged
fruits
were
outstanding
real
complex
only
knock
maybe
be
a
bit
sweet
for
some
palates
and
i
wish
it
was
just
a
touch
thicker
but
thats
just
me
m
its
not
super
think
but
is
a
full
bodied
boozy
beer
o
this
is
a
great
barrel
aged
barleywine
it
actually
might
lean
more
towards
the
english
style
than
american
for
me
but
with
having
this
and
very
mad
cow
by
revolution
i
am
becoming
a
believer
in
their
deep
wood
series
very
well
balanced
and
also
incredibly
drinkable
for
the
style
m
medium
to
full
body
but
a
touch
thin
at
times
light
carbonation

thanks
to
an
awesome
ba
for
sending
me
this
one
pours
a
hazy
amberred
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
not
much
to
write
home
about
gonna
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
okay
ive
let
it
warm
up
long
enough
there
is
some
faint
whiskey
aroma
coming
through
with
nice
vanilla
notes
some
nice
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
more
forward
than
the
nose
initially
great
booziness
im
not
gonna
lie
i
love
my
ba
beers
to
have
some
booziness
and
this
one
has
it
nice
warmth
boozy
whiskey
up
front
with
some
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
flavors
im
not
positive
what
kinda
barrels
this
beer
was
aged
in
but
you
can
tell
they
werent
top
of
the
line
which
is
okay
by
me
im
always
good
for
a
nice
beer
aged
in
jack
barrels
or
something
there
are
some
definite
rye
flavors
coming
in
as
i
taste
it
more
was
this
beer
aged
in
rye
whiskey
barrels
i
should
have
done
my
research
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
the
style
drinkability
is
fairly
high
somewhat
scary
overall
this
beer
is
very
unique
im
getting
a
lot
of
rye
flavors
and
this
is
a
barleywine
im
only
used
to
rye
ba
stouts
and
whatnot
very
tasty
beer
o
very
good
i
was
pretty
impressed
the
heat
is
up
there
but
it
was
not
overly
hot
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
pours
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
and
an
amber
color
this
one
has
a
good
balance
between
sweeter
flavors
and
hop
bitterness
the
smell
is
very
strong
and
full
of
malt
and
bourbon
heat
im
getting
some
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
the
hops
lighten
up
the
sweetness
a
bit
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
o
i
personally
would
put
call
this
more
of
an
english
barleywine
either
way
this
was
a
wellbalanced
slightly
sweet
barleywine
that
i
was
glad
to
try
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
ba
barleywine
it
reminded
me
of
a
slightly
better
less
boozey
bolt
cutter
loads
of
vanilla
and
caramel
mixing
with
whiskey
i
liked
it
a
lot
if
you
like
whiskeybeers
that
are
a
little
bit
hot
or
you
like
bolt
cutter
i
would
definitely
try
to
get
this
one
would
love
to
have
it
again
i
am
satisfied
with
this
rarity
and
my
customers
have
all
been
delighted
in
their
acceptance
of
this
totally
unique
brew
o
a
great
tasting
barleywine
heavy
on
the
barrel
more
carbonation
would
help
the
mouthfeel
but
besides
that
this
is
very
good
o
good
ba
barleywine
not
a
top
10
barleywine
but
falls
in
line
shortly
after
o
delicious
incredibly
smooth
with
a
well
integrated
barrel
there
is
a
slight
touch
of
heat
but
nothing
out
of
line
considering
the
13
abv
slightly
sweet
upfront
but
overall
it
is
very
pretty
balanced
this
is
the
first
ive
had
from
revolution
as
far
as
their
ba
offerings
and
i
am
impressed
a
great
example
of
a
ba
american
barleywine
another
situation
where
i
havent
tried
the
base
beer
but
am
nonetheless
undeterred
from
ticking
the
barreled
version
oh
yeah
this
stuff
pours
a
murky
garnet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
wan
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
toffee
whiskey
light
toasted
oak
light
cocoa
and
candied
orange
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
light
ruby
red
grapefruit
rind
and
a
slightly
boozy
kick
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
barrelaged
barleywine
it
may
not
be
especially
crazy
or
anything
but
id
definitely
have
another
no
hesitation
appears
a
clear
burnt
orange
with
layer
of
tan
head
nice
retention
nose
starts
with
big
bourbon
wave
vanilla
molasses
and
oak
come
through
taste
is
smooth
with
an
assertive
sweet
malt
profile
smooth
vanilla
toffee
caramel
and
marshmallow
a
bit
of
leather
and
earth
finish
things
off
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
overall
the
barrel
really
smooths
things
out
and
makes
this
quite
a
bit
more
exciting
o
an
improvement
over
the
base
beer
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
that
to
begin
with
pretty
forgettable
when
it
comes
to
ba
barleywine
but
overall
not
too
bad
o
a
very
nice
babw
the
flavors
blend
play
well
together
and
im
glad
the
barrel
aging
wasnt
overdone
fairly
sweet
with
lots
of
vanilla
if
there
ever
was
a
dessert
beer
this
would
be
it
wonderful
complexity
richness
of
flavors
play
very
well
together
its
dark
murky
almost
mudlike
appearance
as
it
cascades
in
the
snifter
doesnt
do
much
to
make
you
want
to
dive
right
in
and
perhaps
you
shouldnt
this
gentle
monster
improves
dramatically
as
you
allow
it
to
warm
from
serving
tank
temperature
refreshing
maltiness
for
a
big
barleywine
a
pleasant
departure
from
the
common
hop
the
snot
out
of
it
approach
to
the
style
though
i
love
this
beer
for
its
flavor
and
complexity
its
drinkability
that
sets
it
apart
from
every
other
13er
around
pound
for
pound
the
easiest
drinking
big
beer
in
town
certainly
a
favorite
o
this
was
a
rare
13er
that
didnt
wear
out
our
tongues
dangerously
easy
to
drink
excellent
effort
in
their
ba
program
feel
is
sticky
flavors
of
sweet
caramel
vanilla
and
toffee
flavors
dominate
sweet
lingering
finish
vanilla
from
the
wood
but
not
especially
boozy
the
alcohol
does
seem
to
dry
out
the
palate
after
the
sweetness
passes
the
distinctive
dried
cherry
notes
of
the
base
beer
have
been
obliterated
by
the
barrel
it
seems
overall
this
is
good
and
potent
in
small
doses
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
and
then
only
for
dessert
o
one
of
the
more
fatiguing
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
so
sweet
i
was
ready
to
call
it
quits
after
an
ounce
literally
not
that
it
tastes
bad
just
way
too
powerfully
sweet
and
rich
i
forced
my
way
through
5
ounces
but
was
rough
not
getting
this
again
at
the
price
d
a
decent
barrelaged
barleywine
but
one
of
revolutions
weaker
offerings
i
didnt
feel
the
need
to
order
a
whole
glass
of
this
one
i
think
i
preferred
haymarkets
stab
at
this
style
to
be
honest
although
it
suffered
from
excessive
booze
wooden
hell
ba
behemoth
and
ba
hifi
rye
are
safe
on
the
podium
for
the
moment
sweet
toasted
coconut
strong
alcohol
notes
very
tasty
favorite
barleywine
ive
ever
had
bottle
dark
brown
with
no
head
caramel
and
dark
fruit
aromas
caramel
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
vanilla
flavors
so
much
going
on
here
and
its
all
good
probably
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
2015
2013
vintage
on
tap
at
blind
tiger
nyc
although
sweeter
than
my
palate
prefers
i
really
enjoyed
the
lookaromaflavor
overall
thick
tasty
overall
fw
i
commend
you
and
now
i
can
let
this
one
go
excellent
example
of
the
style
nice
oaky
buttery
smell
taste
complex
with
the
bourbon
up
front
and
a
beautiful
carmel
finish
really
tasty
surprisingly
nice
drank
our
of
a
goblet
shared
12
of
22oz
bottle
as
it
warms
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
oak
shine
i
can
only
assume
this
is
the
bourbon
barrels
as
a
normal
barleywine
doesnt
have
this
level
of
complexity
this
is
by
a
long
shot
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
thanks
fw
crew
too
strong
for
my
liking
o
my
impression
is
that
drinking
this
fresh
as
i
am
i
can
tell
this
beer
is
extremely
wellmade
and
on
its
own
its
really
good
very
nice
base
flavors
in
here
that
are
harmonized
well
also
the
fact
that
this
is
13
3
and
drinks
as
well
is
it
does
is
superimpressive
well
done
i
would
definitely
recommend
getting
one
and
sitting
on
it
for
at
least
1
year
if
allowed
to
blend
in
the
bottle
further
this
will
be
something
extremely
special
mediocre
at
best
just
seemed
to
lack
the
big
barleywine
flavor
not
a
fan
of
barleywines
so
rating
is
biased
draft
really
disappointed
poured
a
light
opaque

that
dissipated
very
quickly
little
lacing
smells
of
coconut
vanilla
dried
fruit
caramelized
sugars
malts
and
a
few
other
things
i
couldnt
identify
tasted
thin
in
the
mouth
like
most
barley
wines
flavors
are
as
above
but
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
over
hyped
before
drinking
maybe
after
taste
is
vanilla
dried
fruit
and
barley
good
but
not
out
of
this
world
good
easily
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
cant
imagine
a
better
one
a
remarkable
barleywine
great

on
a
special
occasion
ive
always
been
an
outlier
the
cherry
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
is
what
stands
out
for
me
strong
alcohol
almost
a
chambord
taste
theres
a
slightly
burnt
flavor
to
the
swallow
rich
body
with
a
diminished
carbonation
think
brandy
with
carbonation
cant
wait
for
the
next
one
this
we
ok
after
reading
the
reviews
and
the
bottle
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
overall
a
good
tasting
beer
started
and
finished
well
i
just
didnt
like
the
feel
o
what
more
to
say
about
firestones
barrel
program
masterful
my
favorite
bba
barleywine
behind
great
overall
this
beer
certainly
lives
up
to
the
hype
even
after
a
solid
two
to
three
years
maturing
in
our
cellar
this
2012
stock
retains
its
intense
buttery
woodiness
dense
caramel
sugariness
and
warming
bourbon
booziness
aside
from
these
obvious
necessities
you
get
ever
shade
of
complexity
to
fill
in
the
gaps
across
the
nose
and
palate
although
we
dont
have
a
great
base
of
comparison
if
seems
that
nothing
has
faded
or
taken
to
the
top
the
balance
remains
supreme
we
tackled
this
as
part
of
our
recent
whale
hunt
our
cellar
space
is
being
dramatically
reduced
in
the
upcoming
months
so
were
systematically
going
through
the
drink
now
beers
weve
been
aging
this
beer
more
or
less
is
helping
to
kick
that
off
in
this
vein
it
was
nice
reading
about
the
history
of
this
beer
it
seems
that
this
was
one
of
if
not
the
genesis
beer
of
their
reserve
series
and
it
fits
so
well
weve
obviously
not
sampled
them
according
to
their
order
of
release
but
it
meets
that
same
quality
of
barrelaged
wonder
that
the
rest
of
them
have
attained
ucaba
is
a
phenomenal
beer
and
something
every
true
beeradvocate
should
seek
out
for
reference
point
and
blissful
enjoyment

amazing
beer
overall
i
this
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
but
its
booziness
is
just
a
little
too
much
for
me
perhaps
i
will
buy
another
of
these
and
cellar
it
for
a
year
to
see
if
that
edge
wears

it

dont

this
is
the

it

just
really

a

but
as
it
warmed
some
the

came
out

have
a

of

may
be

most

ever
just
so
smooth
balanced
assertive
yet
finessed
perfectly
one
of
the
best
beers
in
any
category
on
its
day
fairly
boozy
but
very
complex
would
love
to
procure
one
to
age
definitely
a
sipper
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
smells
of
cherries
pipe
tobacco
leather
burnt
toffee
wood
tastes
of
vanilla
tobacco
caramel
slight
cherry
coconut
alcohol
sweetness
smooth
delicious
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
it
pours
a
thick
auburn
color
with
a
very
thin
mocha
colored
head
the
smell
is
amazing
i
get
heavy
almond
upfront
followed
by
toffee
coconut
vanilla
mild
earthy
hops
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
pretty
closely
with
a
bigger
emphasis
on
the
toffee
caramel
flavors
there
is
a
bit
of
booziness
but
it
is
quite
welcoming
and
subtle
this
is
interesting
because
it
is
the
first
time
that
ive
had
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
where
the
booze
melds
with
the
beer
so
perfectly
that
its
hard
to
tell
where
one
ends
and
the
other
begins
overall
noticeably
sweet
with
overtones
of
coconut
bourbon
and
oak
big
complexity
absolutely
delicious
this
is
just
a
great
beer

a

the

was
the

of
bitter

over

all
the

fw
flavors
are
there
though
oak
and

are
at
the
fore
very

feel
previous
comments
on
a
2014
just
had
a
2015
and
had
to
up
the
ratings
in
certain
areas
on
the
hunt
for
more
a
fingers
of
tightly
packed
crisp
rich
velvety
light
khaki
colored
head
limited
retention
gives
way
to
an
ultra
inviting
full
perfectly
uniform
veil
of
lacing
which
ultimately
turns
a
bit
splotchy
with
a
small
collar
the
color
is
a
deep
slightly
brooding
garnet
a
light
to
moderate
bit
of
carbonation
rises
at
a
slightly
sluggish
pace
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
deep
rich
and
inviting
loaded
with
warm
bready
malts
vanilla
brown
sugar
light
oak
notes
fig
raisins
sweet
plums
well
rounded
deep
and
complex
the
palate
is
not
nearly
as
deep
nor
complex
it
is
loaded
with
oak
and
booze
both
of
which
slightly
overwhelm
the
barleywine
beneath
which
im
fairly
certain
is
trying
to
shine
medium
bodied
sturdy
light
yet
sharply
carbonated
a
touch
of
lushness
to
start
before
a
wave
of
dryness
overcomes
and
lasts
throughout
an
astringent
booziness
rises
on
the
finish
a
solid
english
barleywine
though
if
given
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
have
considered
this
either
an
american
barleywine
or
american
strong
ale
given
all
the
praise
for
this
brew
i
expected
world
class
but
this
one
falls
a
bit
short
perhaps
more
time
in
the
bottle
would
do
this
justice
and
the
barrel
aging
seems
to
obscure
the
base
brew
as
is
the
end
result
is
a
bit
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
if
youre
looking
for
a
really
deep
bourbon
like
ale
than
firestone
sucabaabacus
would
be
a
strong
choice
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
strong
alcoholic
beverages
that
taste
like
bourbon
and
wood
id
stay
away
first
try
not
my
favorite
i
would
try
it
again
while
i
am
not
a
huge
barleywine
fan
i
do
enjoy
them
from
time
to
time
and
i
can
appreciate
the
style
this
one
is
head
and
shoulders
above
the
rest
hell
its
head
and
shoulders
above
anything
ive
had
2
2012
is
tight
and
needs
to
be
aged
more
overall
the
bar
was
set
extremely
high
here
with
the
top
ratings
and
being
a
staple
of
fws
barrel
aging
program
i
think
it
met
those
expectations
perhaps
the
most
complex
beer
ive
had
theres
a
significant
amount
of
barrel
influence
in
the
nose
and
taste
from
bourbon
whiskey
and
oak
and
theres
a
lot
of
sweetness
along
with
a
smoky
tobacco
flavor
that
i
assume
comes
from
the
barrel
aging
they
all
mesh
together
excellently
this
is
the
top
barley
wine
ive
had
fw
continues
to
astound
with
their
skill
it
was
amazing
when
i
got
it
and
even
better
a
year
later
not
nearly
as
hot
as
it
was
when
i
bought
it
wow
this
beer
tastes
wonderful
right
now

overalldelicous
satisfying
great
representative
of
the
style
love
the
effect
of
the
oak
on
this
one
o
ucuba
is
a
damn
fine
brew
and
world
class
on
any
planet
in
our
galaxy
it
may
be
my
favorite
in
fact
if
there
was
one
i
could
have
every
evening
after
dinner
without
question
it
would
be
this
lovely
majesterial
barley
wine
ucuba
brilliant
i
love
barleywines
ive
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
fw
i
thoroughly
enjoy
ba
beers
and
bourbon
in
general
all
of
this
comes
together
about
as
youd
expect
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
i
will
continue
to
pick
a
couple
up
each
year
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
of
dark
and
dried
fruits
alcohol
sherry
big
raisin
and
dark
fruit
notes
sight
woody
dryness
and
solid
char
this
is
a
big
ale
with
noticeable
alcohol
a
hell
of
a
beer
brown
small
head
very
sweet
very
intense
lots
of
vanilla
sugar
cane
mouthfeels
good
certainly
full
bodied
with
a
nice
lingering
flavor
the
carbonation
is
low
which
works
very
well
for
it
fairly
smooth
when
i
expected
it
to
be
a
little
gritty
since
its
so
full
flavored
it
starts
of
big
and
sweet
gets
slightly
bitter
in
the
middle
then
goes
to
a
dry
bitter
finish
like
a
red
wine
the
one
thing
is
its
a
little
hotter
than
i
prefer
but
gets
much
easier
the
more
you
drink
speaking
of
which
its
really
drinkable
really
good
overall
beer
firestone
walker
really
continually
produces
amazing
products
and
probably
the
best
barrel
aging
program
out
there
o
fantastic
ba
barley
wine
the
barrel
is
up
front
with
tons
of
character
from
the
bourbon
left
over
the
alcohol
is
there
but
not
offensive
or
difficult
to
drink
this
beer
aged
perfectly
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
version
to
compare
but
as
it
stands
this
was
superb
im
not
much
of
a
barley
wine
drinker
sucaba
definitely
makes
an
exception
it
has
a
strong
nose
on
it
pour
a
nice
dark
color
has
a
a
strong
flavor
profile
and
still
goes
down
smooth
it
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
long
it
has
aromas
or
fruits
malts
sweetness
and
alcohol
of
course
it
has
strong
notes
of
spices
dates
figs
caramel
woodaged
it
is
strong
but
is
very
smooth
on
the
palate
this
is
my
first
one
2014
edition
and
will
be
buying
more
of
these
in
the
future
made
with
love
very
clean
no

poured
into
a

the
beer

dark
cloudy

with

recedes
into
a

booze
roasted

and

notes
some

flavors

layered

with
notes
of

roasted
notes
butterscotch
booze
and
earthy
highlights
quickly
warming
in
mouth
with
a
dose
of
hops
bitterness
to
keep
some
semblance
of
balance
heavy
and
big
the
body
is
robust
and
smooth
with
an
underlying
dryness
the
aftertaste
is
almost
like
candy
with
a
heavy
dose
of
old
world
fruit
and
booze
tangy
and
richly
sweet
linger
on
a
smooth
drawn
out
finish
very
solid
brew
overall
not
my
favorite
english
barleywine
but
it
was
up
there
felt
it
could
be
a
tad
bit
more
sweet
and
intense
in
favor
but
the
aroma
was
spot
on
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
more
aging
would
affect
this
beer
but
honestly
since
it
was
more
mellow
than
i
expected
now
was
probably
a
better
time
to
drink
it
one
of
the
few
big
abv
over
12oz
bottles
i
would
recommend
not
sharing
this
beer
has
a
extremely
long
development
time
unless
you
drink
it
super
slow
you
miss
out
on
more
than
the
usual
brew
oone
of
my
top
barleywines
it
rivals
king
henry
and
bcbbw
in
my
opinion
the
heat
keeps
it
from
being
perfect
but
i
will
definitely
seek
these
out
in
the
future
2014
needs
to
age
a
bit
not
quite
bitter
enough
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
medicinal
too
much
vanilla
presumably
from
barrel
aging
for
the
style
good
but
slightly
off
barkeep
o
a
great
barrelaged
beer
whereas
most
of
the
barrelaged
beers
tend
to
taste
more
like
bourbon
the
englishinspired
malts
in
this
barleywine
lend
a
more
scotch
whiskey
flavor
worth
checking
out
even
thought
it
is
expensive
overall
this
is
another
delicious
example
of
firestone
doing
everything
right
o
at
first
i
was
quite
disappointed
however
this
beer
definitely
benefits
from
time
spent
in
the
glass
the
most
relatable
beer
ive
had
to
sucaba
lately
was
fremonts
bourbon
abominable
which
for
me
was
clearly
the
superior
beer
this
was
malty
sweet
and
sherrylike
with
nice
tobacco
notes
but
i
wanted
more
bourbon
coconut
vanilla
oak
and
spice
sadly
it
did
not
live
up
to
expectation
pours
a
caramel
color
beer
dark
i
dont
remember
any
carbonation
maybe
a
light
foam
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
i
smelled
some
oak
some
brandy
but
all
very
faint
and
the
beer
doesnt
really
lead
you
anywhere
taste
reveals
a
sweet
barleywine
very
light
not
heady
not
strong
but
very
tasty
not
many
notes
picked
up
body
is
medium
not
a
light
bodied
beer
i
recommend
opening
this
one
for
an
occasion
it
is
that
good
overall
this
is
my
first
perfect
score
on
ba
i
really
can
not
say
anything
bad
about
it
i
certainly
wish
it
was
more
accessible
o
an
outstanding
ba
barleywine
aroma
is
topnotch
and
flavors
are
delightful
but
mouthfeel
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
a
welldone
take
on
the
barley
wine
style
rich
deeply
complex
flavors
and
great
sensory
experiences
with
aroma
and
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
tried
two
years
after
its
release
date
and
seemed
to
age
well
still
packing
plenty
of
punch
and
delivering
exceptional
flavors
i
can
tell
this
beer
is
great
but
i
want
to
try
it
again
either
out
of
bottle
or
a
properly
kept
keg
o
this
barrelaged
beauty
is
a
sipper
and
gets
even
better
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
is
even
more
complex
as
it
becomes
less
cold
i
find
myself
wanting
more
definitely
world
class
what
a
beer
o
very
solid
although
im
not
intrigued
to
plunk
down
the
dough
for
a
bottle
i
cant
help
but
compare
it
with
bourbon
county
bw
i
like
how
the
bc
bw
finishes
with
the
stoutchocolate
flavors
overall
another
winner
from
firestones
barrel
program
first
time
having
this
and
will
definitely
pick
up
in
the
future
a
world
class
beer
worth
a
try
overall
ehhh
i
think
the
bourbon
english
barley
wine
has
a
lot
more
potential
the
bourbon
seems
to
clash
with
the
malts
rather
than
adding
to
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
better
with
some
age
though
o
the
longer
i
sip
this
beer
the
more
flavor
and
aromas
come
out
the
complexity
is
unlike
any
other
beer
it
drinks
pretty
hot
but
actually
is
needed
for
such
a
big
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
one
with
some
age
on
it
to
see
how
it
changes
this
is
the
gem
that
opened
my
eyes
to
barley
wines
why
cant
they
all
be
this
good
the
chocolate
bourbon
and
coconut
notes
are
a
real
joy
13
abc
not
a
chance
by
the
taste
but
wow
how
good
you
feel
once
you
polish
that
bottle
off
wish
this
was
more
readily
available
bottom
line
lives
up
to
the
hype
cant
wait
to
age
a
bottle
owow
this
is
awesome
only
down
side
was
the
appearance
would
love
to
try
a
vintage
bottle
serving
type
bottle
some
time
ago
i
would
have
put
barleywines
at
the
bottom
of
my
goto
list
i
find
beers
like
bigfoot
and
old
guardian
somewhat
of
a
chore
to
drink
barrelaging
completely
changed
my
opinion
and
i
look
forward
to
firestones
annual
release
of
this
incredible
beverage
i
had
been
looking
for
this
beer
for
some
time
and
was
very
happy
to
finally
get
ahold
of
a
bottle
it
lives
up
to
the
expectations
this
is
a
lovely
beer
the
barrel
effect
is
flavourful
and
adds
a
great
deal
but
does
not
overpower
the
base
beer
which
is
terrific
caramel
bread
bourbon
oak
vanilla
and
light
fruitsberries
the
flavour
is
big
but
not
the
overpowering
intensity
that
i
expected
this
is
a
good
thing
it
is
remarkable
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
given
its
potency
first
rate
stuff
now
i
just
have
to
try
and
find
more
a
lot
more
this
is
unbelievable
simply
unbelievable
this
is
an
incredibly
complex
beer
that
hits
you
with
multiple
flavors
from
first
sip
and
continues
until
the
glass
is
empty
absolutely
fantastic
you
need
to
get
your
hands
on
one
of
these
as
if
this
is
how
barleywine
should
taste
and
it
doesnt
hurt
the
vanilla
aromas
and
the
nice
smooth
oaky
background
of
the
barrel
aged
process
good
luck
on
getting
one
of
these
and
enjoy
overall
its
yet
another
ba
take
on
a
style
that
im
quickly
falling
in
love
with
were
it
not
for
the
unconventionally
unique
take
on
the
style
that
gi
released
in
2013
this
would
be
the
benchmark
heck
it
probably
still
is
especially
as
they
continue
to
release
it
every
year
when
bcbw
will
likely
be
a
one
time
thing
i
will
have
to
make
a
point
of
getting
my
hands
on
this
as
often
as
i
can
rating
4
55
zombie
heads
o
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
highly
respected
barleywine
one
of
my
new
favorites
i
just
need
to
get
my
hands
on
a
2014
bottle
now
pours
muddy
and
with
no
head
looks
still
smell
is
dark
fruit
vanilla
and
soy
sauce
in
a
this
chinese
restaurant
uses
way
too
much
sauce
kind
of
way
taste
is
sweet
and
dark
fruits
and
soy
sauce
with
a
quick
finish
at
least
the
booze
is
hidden
very
well
but
with
the
lack
of
almost
any
carbonation
cloying
nature
of
it
and
the
soy
sauce
flavor
it
was
a
big
disappointment
overall
id
drink
it
again
and
again
and
again
if
you
like
light
fizzy
beer
stay
away
this
is
full
body
full
flavor
wholesome
goodness
overall
very
nice
barrelaged
barleywine
slight
lighterbodied
and
perhaps
more
vivacious
than
gi
bcbw
undeniably
excellent
get
this
one
while
you
can
its
world
class
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
get
your
hands
on
this
beer
i
suggest
you
grab
2
one
to
try
one
to
age
for
10
months
22
oz
bottle
first
time
in
a
bottle
after
several
times
on
tap
the
pour
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
solid
head
at
the
beginning
that
fades
pretty
quickly
the
smell
is
sweet
caramel
with
light
vanilla
and
oak
surprisingly
little
alcohol
for
the
abv
the
taste
is
similar
lots
of
caramel
minimal
booze
i
find
this
a
lot
less
sweet
than
similar
beers
of
this
style
say
bourbon
county
barleywine
this
is
really
easy
drinking
due
to
the
low
sweetness
and
despite
the
abv
definitely
my
favorite
barrelaged
barleywine
i
suspect
they
warmage
this
beer
to
hasten
the
maturity
you
lose
a
lot
of
subtlety
and
complexity
that
way
overall
a
bit
on
the
boozy
and
oaky
side
with
a
ton
of
sweetness
a
rather
robust
barley
wine
not
one
i
would
likely
frequent
frequently
but
a
nice
on
to
try
none
the
less
good
dog
bar
philadelphia
pa
ooh
man
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
worth
every
penny
interested
to
see
how
aging
a
bottle
will
turn
out
cheers
from
oak
street
draft
house
in
denton
tx
o
while
aging
this
may
mellow
the
alcohol
it
also
probably
mellows
the
sweetness
almost
like
a
rare
bourbon
just
outstanding
overall
dont
buy
this
beer
i
want
them
all
an
excellent
barleywine
grab
it
if
you
see
it
a
big
shout
out
to
my
buddy
who
snatched
it
up
at
hopscotch
bar
in
franklin
park
to
share
with
me
o
very
enjoyable
and
i
need
to
find
more
bottles
of
this
stuff
in
a
nutshell
propaganda
comes
to
mind
price
versus
product
pricey
to
make
yet
that
doesnt
always
mean
the
best
product
leather
swamp
deceit
devil
on
your
shoulder
ya
not
the
brewers
fault
reasons
beyond
firestones
sucaba
abacus
came
in
6th
in
my
recent
beer
tasting
of
firestone
walkers
top
beers
out
of
the
seven
ba
guys
we
had
at
the
tasting
sucaba
abacus
got
and
average
review
score
of
4
00
for
look
smell
taste
mouthfeel
and
overall
i
was
surprised
by
the
low
scores
and
thought
it
would
have
finished
at
least
in
3rd
place
o
fantastic
the
smell
and
flavor
of
this
beer
are
still
fresh
in
my
mind
after
a
week
i
drank
two
bottles
this
year
and
am
aging
another
two
im
excited
to
see
how
a
bit
of
age
affects
this
masterpiece
i
wasnt
too
interested
in
barleywines
before
i
tried
this
but
they
have
my
attention
now
thank
you
firestone
walker
for
another
amazing
offering
o
barleywine
is
not
my
go
to
style
however
this
is
yet
another
outstanding
offering
by
firestone
walker
i
love
the
deep
complexity
of
this
beer
in
that
it
is
not
overwhelming
or
in
your
face
it
is
a
subtle
enjoyable
drink
overall
this
is
possibly
the
best
barley
wine
ive
ever
had
definitely
a
sipper
at
13
5
if
you
find
it
buy
two
i
did
want
to
say
that
as
amazing
as
it
is
a
beer
less
expensive
still
retains
the
top
spot
for
me
for
english
barleywines
our
finest
regards
by
pretty
things
brewing
while
not
barrel
aged
represents
the
top
of
this
style
for
me
to
date
o
a
very
good
barley
wine
a
tongue
numbing
amount
of
alcohol
but
very
pleasant
dont
plan
on
doing
much
after
polishing
off
22oz
of
this
o
not
very
complex
but
whats
there
is
quite
tasty
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
theres
nothing
else
i
can
compare
it
to
except
bourbon
county
brand
barleywine
in
a
headtohead
i
think
id
choose
this
one
right
now
the
bcbbw
is
so
unbelievably
rich
its
difficult
to
drink
this
one
is
also
rich
and
intensely
flavored
but
much
more
smooth
refined
and
balanced
with
a
little
age
bcbbw
might
be
more
like
this
one
but
right
now
it
is
not
and
i
have
to
give
a
tip
of
the
cap
to
this
beer
my
own
personal
champion
of
englishstyle
barleywines
overall
love
this
stuff
my
favourite
style
of
beer
and
an
array
of
flavours
to
keep
it
interesting
id
like
a
little
more
barrel
flavour
but
maybe
the
taste
has
faded
a
little
pricey
but
definetly
worth
it
to
try
it
once
at
least
this
beer
is
massively
overrated
and
should
rate
somewhere
around
the
low
90s
the
beer
pours
some
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
but
still
leaves
a
ring
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
beer
itself
is
an
opaque
dark
plum
color
the
beer
has
notes
of
very
dark
purple
with
black
that
strongly
resemble
plum
the
smell
is
fairly
complex
with
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
dark
fruit
smell
that
resembles
plums
with
a
bit
of
oak
and
a
very
concealed
note
of
alcohol
with
a
bit
of
barely
smell
the
strong
notes
are
definitely
the
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
caramel
and
plum
notes
dominate
the
taste
the
alcohol
and
oak
make
an
appearance
and
compliment
the
stronger
notes
very
well
and
end
up
creating
a
nice
caramel
taste
in
some
places
notes
of
vanilla
from
the
barrel
also
appear
the
beer
is
heavy
bodied
but
very
smooth
to
the
point
where
it
feels
silky
overall
a
fantastic
barleywine
and
one
that
ill
go
looking
for
each
year
o
i
had
my
doubts
that
this
beer
would
live
up
to
the
hype
but
it
definitely
did
and
then
some
if
it
werent
for
the
price
and
availability
i
would
be
drinking
this
every
day
very
complex
there
is
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
this
bottle
overall
this
could
be
poured
over
ice
cream
as
a
high
end
dessert
its
so
delicious
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
even
had
for
me
its
a
little
heavy
so
not
an
every
evening
type
of
beer
but
i
feel
very
lucky
i
tried
it
and
cannot
wait
for
the
second
one
to
age
a
few
years
with
the
depth
of
what
i
tasted
today
that
will
be
one
special
bottle
extremely
highly
recommended
pours
dark
cherry
with
an
off
white
head
lots
of
great
bourbon
in
the
nose
some
vanilla
dark
fruits
caramel
flavor
follows
suit
fuller
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
barleywine
fan
from
my
limited
experience
but
quite
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
not
sure
i
care
to
bother
with
more
barleywines
but
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
o
by
far
the
best
barrelaged
barleywine
ive
ever
had
exceeded
expectations
cannot
wait
to
try
that
other
bottle
next
year
to
see
how
it
has
aged
well
forth
the
price
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
well
this
certainly
warrants
a
formal
review
abacussucaba
is
an
extremely
high
end
barrel
aged
barleywine
possibly
the
best
i
regard
fw
as
the
gold
standard
in
barrel
aging
and
it
really
shows
in
this
one
extremely
sophisticated
barrel
presence
lots
of
oak
dark
cherries
chocolate
stinging
bourbon
finish
wonderful
after
trying
to
analyze
i
sat
back
and
just
enjoyed
the
beer
when
i
did
this
i
noticed
a
light
sweetness
throughout
the
sip
that
helps
hold
the
whole
taste
together
overall
it
reminded
me
of
a
more
tart
version
of
bcbs
i
had
a
bottle
of
2013
ucaba
that
had
been
aged
for
exactly
one
year
after
missing
out
on
the
2014
ucaba
release
at
my
goto
liquor
stores
i
consoled
myself
by
breaking
out
the
2013
version
from
my
cellar
ucaba
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
dissapates
relatively
quickly
the
smell
had
notes
of
toffee
caramel
bourbon
vanilla
and
oak
the
taste
was
fantastic
combination
of
sweet
decadent
caramelized
malts
and
bourbon
barrel
notes
burnt
caramel
toffee
butterscotch
caramelized
brown
sugar
bourbon
charred
oak
vanilla
coconut
dark
sweet
cherries
and
subtle
chocolatecoffee
flavors
ucaba
has
a
pronounced
barrel
character
that
compliments
the
sweet
malts
beautifully
without
feeling
too
boozy
i
thought
the
bourbon
notes
were
quite
smooth
without
the
type
of
heat
that
you
might
expect
from
a
12
5
abv
barleywine
i
think
one
year
of
aging
may
have
been
the
perfect
cellaring
period
the
mouthfeel
was
remarkably
smooth
velvety
and
drinkable
for
the
abv
this
beer
was
truly
a
pleasure
to
drink
firestone
walker
has
blown
me
away
again
once
again
with
their
bourbon
barrelaged
releases
if
i
have
to
choose
my
favorite
barleywine
of
alltime
it
is
a
close
call
between
ucaba
and
bourbon
county
barleywine
but
i
think
i
would
have
to
give
a
slight
edge
to
ucaba
simply
fantastic
overall
this
very
well
could
be
my
new
favorite
barleywine
with
the
only
other
possibility
being
stickee
monkey
another
from
firestone
i
am
absolutely
giddy
looking
forward
to
trying
the
2014
sucaba
release
very
complex
and
enjoyable
aromas
and
flavors
with
unmistakable
bourbon
qualities
sip

and
enjoy

overall

have
had
this

over

years
and
it
never
fails
simply
awesome
makes
me
want
more
o
its
amazing
easily
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
overall
very
nice
the
flavors
are
very
mild
though
it
is
right
out
of
the
fridge
so
it
should
be
more
inviting
as
it
warms
this
is
such
an
amazing
beer
firestones

are

better
you
get

much
from

just
amazing
nice

caramel
and

middle

back

lots
of

a
little
boozy
but
this
is
a
big
beer
i
would
have
given
this
a
5
but
i
think
with
proper
aging
this
beer
will
only
get
better
sucaba
is
excellent
i
love
this
beer
d
definitely
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
a
favorite
for
me
english
in
style
and
almost
too
much
going
on
to
the
point
where
flavors
start
to
get
a
bit
muddled
mix
in
some
untamed
alcohol
and
we
are
falling
short
at
times
i
think
i
would
prefer
just
a
straight
bourbon
barrel
approach
here
would
like
to
revisit
an
older
vintage
possibly
o
just
fabulous
such
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
been
holding
out
of
this
one
for
a
while
and
have

amazing
stuff
lots
of
delicious
bourbon
character
while
retaining
all
the
great
qualities
of
an
english
bw
picked
this
up
in
a
great
trade
with
mike
beautifyul
clear
mahogany
pour
with
an
offwhite
two
finger
head
with
decent
retention
and
great
lacing
boozy
woody
nose
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
butterscotch
oak
vanilla
caramel
and
subtle
bourbon
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
booze
and
wood
along
with
hints
of
toffee
dark
fruits
caramel
vanilla
oak
butterscotch
maple
bourbon
and
some
subtle
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
initially
a
bit
on
the
hot
and
boozy
side
but
as
it
warmed
it
became
quite
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
is
another
world
class
offering
from
firestone
walker
i
have
a
couple
in
the
cellar
and
cant
wait
to
try
them
id
seek
this
one
out
and
after
trying
a
fresh
bottle
i
really
want
a
couple
to
age
plenty
going
on
and
im
going
to
sleep
well
tonight
o
i
loved
this
style
of
barley
wine
it
nearly
resembles
a
world
class
stat
except
for
the
finish
of
these
beers
i
loved
the
dark
fruits
really
erupting
as
it
warmed
and
went
down
the
back
of
my
throat
world
class
glad
i
was
able
to
snag
a
bottle
of
this
on
black
friday
o
a
great
beer
but
i
have
to
say
the
big
alcohol
presence
was
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
and
unexpected
i
was
assuming
id
get
something
a
bit
smoother
had
this
a
few
days
after
having
goose
islands
bcbw
and
that
was
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
and
may
ever
have
and
this
kind
of
paled
in
comparison
to
be
honest
and
bcbw
is
12
1
and
sucaba
is
12
5
but
the
alcohol
prescence
would
lead
me
to
believe
it
is
more
like
15
and
a
could
barely
detect
the
abv
in
bcbw
also
the
bourbon
barrel
presence
is
there
but
at
a
medium
level
compared
to
other
big
ba
beers
ive
had
barelywines
and
old
ales
along
with
scotch
ales
are
my
favorite
beer
styles
and
hope
to
see
more
barrel
aged
ones
o
wonderful
taste
treat
refined
and
definitely
a
top
representation
of
the
style
very
nice
high
abv
brew
in
line
with
the
16
and
17
yep
really
want
to
love
this
beer
i
have
tried
a
few
vintages
and
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
firestone
and
barley
wines
i
just
dont
think
this
is
a
superior
beer
the
booze
is
all
there
in
the
tasting
i
think
actually
to
much
of
the
booze
comes
through
in
the
flavor
and
that
is
the
real
problem
with
this
beer
behemoth
is
still
my
staple
for
barley
wine
poured
into
a
large
snifter
after
about
20
minutes
out
of
the
ice
bucket
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
fair
amount
of
tan
creamy
head
good
lacing
and
the
collar
was
thick
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
of
toffee
caramel
some
woody
earthiness
sweet
medium
roasted
malt
too
taste
is
of
toffeecaramel
leather
woodyearthy
very
lightly
smokey
perhaps
because
of
the
campfire
so
damn
good
mouthfeel
is
all
that
barleywines
should
be
appropriately
carbonated
medium
creamy
body
i
could
drink
this
til
the
cows
come
home
too
bad
i
have
to
trade
for
it
pours
a
dark
reddish
black
beer
with
a
small
off
white
creamy
head
on
top
aroma
hasgives
massive
wood
vanilla
bourbon
caramel
and
touches
of
chocolate
flavor
is
sweet
bourbon
vanilla
characteristics
combined
with
a
chocolate
malty
backbone
big
wood
presence
in
the
flavors
as
well
making
it
very
complex
and
a
great
sipper
very
well
balanced
and
an
awesome
beer
overall
theres
a
reason
this
is
the
standard
by
which
barleywine
is
held
to
just
a
fantastic
sipper
that
is
warming
and
delicious
overall
another
incredibly
complex
and
awesome
beer
from
firestone
walker
i
had
both
this
and
parabola
with
about
a
year
of
age
on
them
and
im
not
sure
they
could
get
better
mellow
and
smooth
yet
bold
and
distinctive
firestone
walker
just
gets
barrel
aging
beer
overal
an
outstanding
barleywine
how
is
this
12
so
smooth
if
my
review
was
based
on
grades
the
appearance
would
be
the
valedictorian
the
smell
the
salutatorian
and
the
taste
would
be
a
graduate
o
eh
not
my
favorite
but
no
burn
i
will
review
this
again
with
my
bottle
but
so
far
i
dont
get
all
of
the
hype
the
beer
has
a
curious
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
it
begin
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
finishes
with
a
slick
almost
oily
feel
the
oily
feel
is
very
brief
and
unfavorable
but
im
really
only
nitpicking
here
just
something
i
have
not
experienced
before
the
taste
begins
with
a
warming
impression
of
strong
malt
flavor
that
fades
to
the
dark
fruit
that
was
strong
in
the
nose
consisting
of
prunes
and
raisins
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
on
the
finish
with
a
slight
reemergence
of
the
alcohol
very
consistent
to
the
english
barley
wine
style
with
then
barrel
aging
providing
layers
of
complexity
very
good
beer
and
wonderfully
done
blending
and
using
the
various
barrels
o
excellent
complexity
but
its
overly
sweet
and
the
bourbon
runs
the
show
here
o
4
25
its
good
given
its
reputation
i
had
for
some
reason
expected
a
bolder
complexity
in
terms
of
layering
but
like
some
other
englishstyle
barleywines
ive
had
and
like
a
lot
of
english
and
englishstyle
beers
in
general
its
subtlety
makes
its
complexity
something
you
have
to
work
for
in
this
case
at
least
beyond
the
sherry
notes
which
are
themselves
pretty
bold
and
nice
to
have
there
in
the
center
is
a
mildness
where
i
want
something
more
style
considerations
aside
if
i
could
magically
alter
it
for
the
better
id
put
a
puff
of
spice
in
it
for
that
extra
sense
of
layering
and
altitude
give
it
a
buttery
viscosity
to
play
against
the
bitterdry
ending
and
add
something
unmistakeably
earthy
to
give
it
some
additional
depth
and
counterpoint
to
the
sweet
elements
take
me
down
low
its
still
a
very
nice
beer
and
well
made
the
potency
of
the
alcohol
in
it
leaves
you
dreamy
warm
and
relaxed
to
me
its
an
ideal
slow
nohurry
contemplative
sipper
for
when
the
weather
cools
great
brewery
cheers
o
up
there
with
king
henry
and
bcbbw
for
me
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
barleywines
though
a
beer
worthy
of
its
high
ratings
o
still
a
great
beer
different
than
fresh
has
definitely
cooled
down
a
bit
a
strange
candy
flavor
has
emerged
i
prefer
it
fresh
i
havent
been
able
to
get
my
hands
on
a
ton
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywines
but
of
the
ones
ive
had
this
would
be
my
favorite
i
love
the
flavors
of
oak
bourbon
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
firestone
walker
really
does
a
great
job
with
their
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
it
would
be
nice
to
try
a
2013
maybe
i
would
have
different
feelings
about
this
without
the
age
being
a
possible
factor
o
excellent
barrel
aged
ale
one
of
my
favorites
went
perfectly
with
some
english
stilton
update
drank
a
2012
sucaba
a
few
days
later
the
barrel
notes
a
bit
more
muted
and
the
beer
is
just
as
sweet
as
the
2013
the
booziness
seems
more
noticeable
in
the
2012
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
beer
fresh
toasted
malt
and
toasted
coconut
up
front
caramel
and
rummy
fruit
melange
follow
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
toffee
in
the
mix
nice
sweetness
levelnot
too
cloying
toasted
coconut
picks
up
toward
the
finish
vanilla
and
woody
oak
notes
intensify
as
well
more
figgy
fruit
and
toffee
in
the
finish
along
with
plenty
of
soothing
warming
alcohol
smooth
and
not
too
hot
fullbodied
creamy
feel
a
beautifully
put
together
beer
too
drinkable
for
its
strength
well
done
o
this
is
an
excellent
delicious
barleywine
lots
of
sweetness
throughout
but
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
flavors
one
of
the
best
examples
ive
had
cheers
thanks
to
my
cousin
brian
for
this
one
o
an
epic
beer
really
emphasizes
on
the
bourbon
barrels
the
beer
itself
provides
a
very
nice
base
for
the
barrel
program
wish
i
could
get
this
one
in
my
area
edit
finally
got
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
to
see
how
this
should
taste
the
short
answer
is
much
better
nice
bourbon
flavor
good
sweetness
from
the
malt
fairly
smooth
just
a
touch
of
heat
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
gets
a
bit
onedimensional
about
halfway
through
the
bomber
a
very
nice
bbbw
well
done
fw
what
a
great
barleywine
firestone
knocked
this
beer
out
of
the
park
cellars
well
hold
on
to
this
one
for
a
few
years
to
really
get
the
most
out
of
it
rich
and
malty
beer
with
great
balance
english
yeast
adds
complexity
to
this
beer
that
american
barleywines
can
lack
overall
just
an
outstanding
fine
work
of
art
thank
you
fw
httpmynie
comp618
overall
firestone
walker
is
quickly
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
to
that
trend
overrated
ehhh
perhaps
youll
have
to
be
the
judge
of
that
but
id
still
rank
this
brew
close
to
world
class
in
status
trying
a
relatively
fresh
2014
bottle
on
6914
courtesy
of
doug
amazing
lasting
vanilla
finish
on
this
with
more
dark
fruit
than
i
remember
from
the
last
time
less
caramel
and
more
bready
toffee
still
as
yummy
as
before
mmmm
oa
great
barleywine
one
of
the
standards
by
which
others
should
be
judged
pours
seal
brown
with
mahogany
highlights
and
a
thin
khaki
head
i
dont
recall
the
aroma
but
id
love
to
have
it
again
and
investigate
further
flavor
tastes
of
dark
fruit
oak
vanilla
mild
milk
chocolate
and
booze
without
messing
around
lets
just
say
this
is
probably
one
of
the
ten
best
beers
ive
ever
had
its
luxurious
balanced
complex
and
way
more
drinkable
than
a
13
abv
beer
has
any
right
to
be
it
was
outstanding
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
and
only
prudence
prevented
me
from
having
a
second
glass
i
can
find
no
fault
with
it
one
of
the
best
aromas
ive
ever
smelled
from
a
beer
complexity
is
an
overused
word
but
this
is
complex
the
transitions
of
aroma
taste
and
feel
over
the
course
of
the
bottle
are
incredible
full
barrel
flavors
the
meld
beautifully
dont
know
how
this
could
get
any
better
with
age
this
is
as
good
as
a
barleywine
can
get
for
me
a
style
of
beer
i
dont
always
rush
to
score
because
of
the
heavy
fusel
alcohols
and
mess
of
grains
usually
accompanying
american
versions
this
however
is
a
masterpiece
thanks
to
claystation
for
hooking
it
up
2013
release
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
dense
but
not
particularly
cloudy
with
a
tall
and
fairly
long
lasting
off
white
head
the
nose
is
very
complex
but
also
mellow
i
definitely
get
red
wine
charcoal
bourbon
rye
malt
caramel
and
alcohol
the
different
barrel
blends
really
come
out
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
giving
a
lot
of
layers
to
this
monster
the
flavor
features
some
vanilla
and
some
toffee
brown
sugar
but
its
not
too
sweet
and
some
dried
fruits
in
the
date
or
fig
range
again
the
complexity
is
stunning
furthermore
the
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
in
not
caustic
or
hot
like
i
expected
it
to
be
its
in
fact
quite
tame
just
warming
appropriate
this
is
also
oddly
drinkable
for
its
magnitude
its
soft
in
feel
but
very
well
carbonated
and
the
body
is
full
but
not
filling
per
se
i
cant
say
enough
about
this
one
everything
is
dialed
in
and
its
a
beer
only
firestone
walker
could
pull
off
its
got
their
signature
all
over
it
i
was
hesitant
and
skeptical
to
see
a
barleywine
so
high
in
the
ba
rankings
but
this
makes
perfect
sense
now
that
ive
had
it
i
will
look
forward
to
my
next
bottle
with
great
enthusiasm
a
must
try
this
is
pretty
much
the
end
all
and
be
all
of
the
style
for
me
taste
has
a
very
malt
mixed
with
dark
fruity
raisiny
flavor
going
on
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
but
nothing
too
cloying
body
is
nice
and
full
carbonation
is
soft
but
active
which
lends
a
hand
with
the
full
body
the
boozy
alcohol
burn
is
present
but
surprisingly
is
really
only
hits
the
back
of
the
throat
and
not
so
much
in
the
mouth
which
is
nice
a
very
nice
sipper
indeed
hv
o
theres
a
reason
this
has
such
a
strong
reputation
it
has
the
impressive
ability
to
meld
together
a
smooth
drinkability
with
an
amazingly
complex
taste
and
is
truly
a
unique
drinking
experience
i
have
a
2011
bottle
sitting
around
too
ill
have
to
see
how
thats
drinking
soon
ontap
as
part
of
a
firestone
tap
takeover
pour
is
a
dark
chestnut
brown
very
barrelforward
in
the
nose
and
in
the
beginning
lots
of
vanilla
is
present
mouthfeel
is
amazing
i
can
drink
this
all
day
warming
towards
the
end
i
would
love
to
see
this
after
a
year
however
having
this
aged
from
2012
on
tap
at
brouwerij
lane
i
prefer
this
fresh
with
age
the
booze
mellows
but
as
does
the
big
bold
flavors
it
becomes
less
complex
and
bold
not
that
it
is
not
still
amazing
but
i
just
prefer
the
wide
range
of
flavors
that
the
fresh
one
has
overall
solid
a
with
inclinations
toward
a
this
is
a
must
try
and
a
steal
at
the
price
i
will
not
hesitate
to
pick
2
or
3
or
however
many
i
can
afford
next
year
wow
i
knew
people
were
head
over
heels
in
love
with
this
thing
but
now
after
having
it
i
see
why
this
transcends
the
barleywine
style
as
we
know
it
integrating
the
best
of
brandy
bourbon
and
american
white
oak
flavors
as
well
as
incorporating
a
british
malty
goodness
with
a
west
coast
hop
grassy
profile
at
the
finish
undeniably
complex
and
im
kicking
myself
for
not
buying
a
bottle
or
two
extra
to
see
how
a
vintage
this
great
would
end
up
tasting
in
a
year
or
two
not
an
everyday
beer
but
undeniably
delicious
cant
wait
to
try
parabola
and
ddba
as
well
and
immerse
myself
with
fws
incredible
barrel
program
this
is
pivotal
for
sure
every
fan
of
barleywines
and
barrelaged
beers
must
check
it
out
this
is
exceptional
stuff
far
exceeded
my
expectations
as
i
havent
been
wowed
by
a
barleywine
in
many
moons
well
done
firestone
walker
well
done
indeed
the
sucaba
i
had
on
tap
was
delicious
very
strong
bourbon
notes
vanilla
appearance
was
a
very
dark
black
but
not
opaque
thin
lacing
of
head
and
smelled
very
similar
to
bcs
which
i
had
on
the
side
the
taste
is
spectacular
probably
my
favorite
barleywine
but
i
dont
typically
drink
this
style
of
beer
out
of
a
bottle
it
is
not
so
complex
a
little
thinner
but
the
flavor
is
there
it
is
also
quite
boozy
in
comparison
to
the
tap
makes
me
think
the
sucaba
on
tap
was
from
a
year
or
more
ago
definitely
excited
to
try
the
other
bottles
i
have
in
the
cellar
perfection
in
a
bottle
o
i
quite
enjoyed
this
despite
typically
not
liking
barleywines
very
much
the
barrel
aged
character
of
this
beer
imparted
wonderful
flavors
that
balanced
beautifully
with
the
beer
although
they
did
seem
to
take
over
the
beer
and
mostly
use
it
as
a
vehicle
for
barrel
deliciousness
delivery
i
was
glad
that
i
was
able
to
split
this
bottle
5
ways
because
with
that
size
of
pour
i
am
left
excited
to
revisit
another
bottle
in
6
months
or
a
year
i
definitely
could
not
have
enjoyed
it
as
much
had
i
finished
a
bottle
by
myself
even
if
the
alcohol
content
was
not
an
issue
another
great
barrelaged
offering
from
firestone
walker
that
i
would
advocate
anyone
trying
this
beer
was
a
treat
sweeter
than
expected
but
not
overbearingly
so
loved
this
one
overall
55
absolutely
outstanding
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
style
take
this
one
slow
and
appreciate
true
craftsmanship
to
say
the
least
im
excited
to
try
aging
one
very
original
beer
a
fun
try
one
of
the
better
bws
ive
had
o
wow
a
masterpiece
and
may
be
the
single
best
barleywine
i
have
tasted
world
class
all
the
way
and
worth
every
penny
of
the
purchase
price
nothing
else
to
say
besides
if
you
havent
had
it
get
it
o
excellent
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
english
barleywines
that
money
can
buy
seriously
love
this
beer
it
makes
me
wish
it
was
available
all
year
long
so
good
this
beer
is
exquisite
overall
id
say
between
01
years
is
best
for
this
beer
it
gets
a
bit
sweet
with
two
years
deep
darker
amber
pour
with
a
small
beige
head
that
retained
as
a
thin
ringlet
nice
sugary
nose
toffee
and
brown
sugar
raisins
bourbon
and
surprisingly
quite
a
bit
of
the
woodbarrel
profile
remained
even
after
aging
for
a
couple
years
the
aroma
was
reflected
in
the
taste
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
hint
of
vanilla
bourbon
barrel
raisins
herbal
and
earthy
hops
in
the
distance
chewy
mouthfeel
full
body
a
great
barleywine
overall
i
have
a
few
bottles
of
other
vintages
that
im
looking
forward
to
sampling
soon
o
this
is
outstanding
remember
this
review
is
based
on
a
beer
that
is
pushing
68months
old
huge
drinkable
layered
barrel
aged
barley
wine
drink
one
fresh
save
one
for
later
trust
me
its
worth
it
o
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
and
im
glad
i
did
it
is
sweet
but
not
disappointingly
sweet
a
great
example
of
american
barley
wine
it
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
firestone
walker
does
not
disappoint
overall
the
more
barrelaged
beers
i
try
the
more
i
realize
im
just
not
that
into
them
im
not
a
fan
of
hard
liquor
because
i
dont
much
like
the
taste
and
i
dont
like
that
drying
alcohol
burn
sensation
i
can
understand
why
this
beer
has
a
100
score
on
here
its
phenomenally
crafted
clean
wellattuned
layers
of
flavor
at
the
end
of
the
day
though
its
just
not
my
bag
too
much
alcohol
burn
for
me
to
truly
enjoy
aged
1
year
pours
darkish
brown
with
decent
head
maybe
the
best
smelling
beer
of
all
time
a
bit
of
malty
bourbon
that
reall
complements
the
barley
wine
notes
kind
of
a
syrup
smell
too
this
is
as
smooth
as
smooth
gets
for
a
bourbon
aged
barley
wine
best
in
class
in
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
this
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
would
definitely
seek
this
out
cant
say
enough
positives
about
the
beer
overall
this
was
a
stunning
and
wonderfully
complex
barrelaged
englishstyle
barleywine
ive
had
quality
beer
from
firestone
walker
in
the
past
but
this
is
on
a
whole
other
level
of
greatness
o
not
the
first
fw
beer
to
leave
me
pretty
much
speechless
and
im
sure
it
wont
be
the
last
easily
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
o
drinks
a
lot
less
than
12
5
a
sipper
but
only
because
its
really
complex
and
you
want
to
savor
it
best
barrel
aged
beer
ive
had
that
hasnt
been
a
imperial
stout
o
very
good
barley
wine
that
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
satisfied
the
pallet
for
long
periods
between
sips
o
4
75
definitely
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
barrelaged
english
barleywines
that
i
have
ever
tasted
there
is
so
much
almost
too
much
going
on
in
the
nose
and
mouth
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
is
worth
trading
for
and
aging
to
try
in
a
vertical
tasting
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
can
be
expensive

in
the
greater
d
c
area
o
an
excellent
beer
no
doubt
about
it
the
maltiness
plays
off
the
sweet
barrel
flavors
very
nicely
lots
of
complexity
and
great
depth
o
outstanding
complexity
smoothness
and
balance
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
tick
this
beer
among
the
reasons
why
firestone
walker
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
country
o
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
but
still
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
tasted
wow
i
finally
got
to
try
this
and
it
didnt
disappoint
smooth
and
flavorful
all
the
way
down
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
this
again
wanted
to
go
a
4
75
for
the
overall
but
couldnt
quite
pull
the
trigger
o
a
fantastic
beer
that
probably
deserves
a
clean
4
5
but
i
was
just
not
digging
the
nose
however
the
two
weakest
aspects
the
nose
and
mouthfeel
improved
to
damn
good
after
opening
up
to
room
temperature
suuucaaabaaa
me
oh
my
i
love
love
love
this
beer
ironic
because
im
not
really
a
barleywine
fan
but
this
is
far
more
than
just
a
bw
its
like
dessert
in
a
glass
it
has
pretty
much
every
wonderful
aroma
and
flavor
mixed
into
it
and
each
time
i
have
it
it
never
disappoints
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
id
strongly
suggest
seeking
it
out
simply
sublime
o
hardly
arguably
one
of
the
top
3
american
barleywines
ive
had
worth
the
extra
effort
on
their
part
very
nice
highly
recommended
for
yourself
or
as
a
gift
d
glad
this
thing
has
gotten
as
low
as
it
has
attenuation
wise
otherwise
it
may
be
tough
to
drink
otherwise
super
big
dark
flavors
dark
chocolate
bitter
dark
grains
black
cherries
complex
more
boozy
than
i
would
like
i
wouldnt
have
mind
it
if
i
aged
this
for
another
couple
years
just
to
smooth
it
out
a
bit
more
however
still
super
drinkable
now
o
a
great
treat
on
draft
although
it
didnt
have
quite
the
kick
that
the
bottle
i
had
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
a
fanatastic
beer
either
way
with
that
in
mind
this
is
a
big
cuddly
and
loveable
brew
flavours
i
love
and
the
development
of
the
palate
is
superb
if
not
for
that
slight
overheated
booze
on
the
back
this
would
have
been
held
in
wonderful
balance
overall
9394
a
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
did
it
live
up
to
its
hype
it
did
for
me
i
would
have
liked
more
bourbon
and
oak
aromas
and
taste
but
thats
probably
due
to
this
beers
young
age
i
would
love
to
age
a
bottle
to
see
how
it
will
taste
in
the
future
but
i
only
scored
one
bottle
so
sad
overall
this
is
very
good
beer
and
i
suspect
with
aging
it
will
become
even
better
however
as
young
as
my
bottle
is
the
bourbon
notes
simply
overpower
many
of
the
flavors
making
the
mouthful
not
nearly
as
mouthwatering
as
the
aroma
and
giving
the
beer
a
very
strong
jackandcoke
overtone
if
i
buy
a
second
bottle
of
thisand
i
likely
willim
going
to
cellar
it
for
a
good
two
years
overall
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
incredibly
complex
and
insanely
smooth
seek
out
a
bottle
to
drink
now
and
a
few
more
to
age
overall
a
pretty
good
barrelaged
barleywine
this
one
has
a
whole
lot
of
heat
to
it
however
which
can
always
bring
some
mixed
reactions
i
dont
think
it
kills
it
but
adds
some
interesting
character
o
i
am
not
the
biggest
barelywine
fan
but
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
very
well
done
and
easy
to
drink
for
12
5
abv
cant
wait
to
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
2013
pours
dark
amber
with
a
quickly
fading
eggshell
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
bourbon
barrel
flavor
is
sweet
with
bourbon
notes
that
finishes
with
wood
and
smoke
some
fusel
alcohol
on
the
back
end
palate
is
a
bit
thin
for
such
a
big
beer
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
finest
englishstyle
barleywines
ive
ever
had
an
outstanding
barley
wine
excellent
balance
between
barrel
bourbon
and
caramelly
malty
goodness
i
tend
to
like
the
hoppy
barley
wines
hog
heaven
behemoth
etc
but
this
is
fantastic
another
must
try
offering
from
firestone
walker
o
great
beer
good
example
of
an
english
style
barley
malt
forward
and
the
barrel
aging
is
slightly
hinted
on
this
years
wow
sooo
close
to
a
perfect
score
from
me
but
i
had
to
knock
off
a
few
ticks
for
the
thin
mouthfeel
and
muted
aroma
otherwise
this
brew
is
out
of
this
world
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
moderate
1finger
head
smells
of
sweet
malt
with
bourbon
and
vanilla
overtones
the
typical
mellow
oakiness
is
also
present
from
the
barrel
aging
overall
the
flavors
are
perfectly
balanced
without
any
single
one
overpowering
the
others
a
tad
heavy
on
the
sweetness
but
absolutely
nothing
offensive
the
12
5
abv
is
present
but
fits
into
the
overall
flavor
profile
like
the
last
piece
of
a
jigsaw
puzzle
the
sweet
heat
and
bite
is
a
welcomed
finale
to
each
outstanding
sip
a
solid
a
for
this
brew
nothing
less
easily
worth
the
15bomber
and
ill
be
looking
to
stock
up
on
this
each
and
every
release
pours
a
crimson
brown
with
a
little
bit
of
head
that
quickly
faded
away
into
nothing
the
smell
is
extrodinary
with
a
lot
of
toffee
vanilla
bourbon
and
i
want
to
say
cinnomon
but
it
might
just
be
a
spiceness
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
other
worldly
it
is
another
absolutly
fantastic
addition
to
fws
rep
it
is
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
bourbon
and
wine
barrells
really
mellowed
this
beer
not
a
lot
of
taste
from
the
wine
barrells
which
i
like
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
from
time
to
time
not
trading
this
one
overall
this
stuff
is
pretty
good
but
im
a
bit
let
down
after
trying
parabola
last
weekend
this
really
needs
to
lie
down
for
a
while
should
really
improve
with
some
age
i
have
three
more
in
my
cellar
ill
return
with
a
rereview
in
a
year
or
two
o
a
home
run
from
fsw
fantastic
beer
that
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
develops
ive
waited
a
long
time
to
try
sucaba
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
this
is
such
a
complex
brew
and
the
bourbon
really
stands
out
and
makes
a
grand
presence
its
a
heavier
version
of
founders
backwoods
bastard
in
my
opinion
and
thats
one
of
my
favorite
beers
o
beautiful
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
it
deep
amber
clear
in
appearance
with
a
very
creamy
half
finger
tan
head
spots
cling
to
the
glass
sparingly
lots
of
caramel
with
toffee
candy
rich
chocolate
vanilla
and
strong
oak
not
overpowering
toasted
wheat
bread
is
also
prevalent
caramel
and
vanilla
dominate
the
palate
with
dark
chocolate
candied
sugar
and
lot
of
booze
to
end
feel
is
slightly
viscous
with
a
dry
finish
great
but
i
cant
have
more
than
a
snifter
since
its
so
sweet
o
really
great
beer
super
easy
drinking
hides
the
abv
no
problem
could
drink
this
every
night
only
gripe
would
be
a
little
lack
of
depth
in
the
flavor
profile
but
overall
an
aa
beer
overall
this
is
truly
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
firestone
walker
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
that
their
line
is
so
varied
and
robust
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
i
thought
it
was
a
stout
at
first
and
put
it
on
line
with
bcbs
i
wasnt
until
i
reviewed
it
that
i
learned
it
was
considered
an
english
barleywine
you
need
to
go
get
this
brew
as
soon
as
possible
o
amazing
everything
a
person
is
looking
for
in
an
english
barelywine
if
i
really
had
to
pick
out
a
downfall
and
im
nit
picking
is
a
more
potent
scent
overall
i
really
love
this
one
i
will
probably
grab
the
2013
and
maybe
try
to
age
it
longer
than
i
did
this
one
o
this
is
my
new
favorite
barleywine
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
four
others
to
age
if
you
can
find
it
but
as
much
of
it
as
you
can
dont
settle
for
just
one
like
me
o
im
a
stout
guyba
stout
guy
that
being
said
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
balanced
complex
beers
of
any
style
that
ive
ever
consumed
the
glory
of
this
beer
is
the
balance
of
the
bourbon
and
additional
flavors
they
compliment
one
another
perfectly
this
is
by
far
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
tried
and
its
not
even
close
overall
firestone
walkers
barrel
program
makes
some
of
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
the
level
of
complexity
on
this
beer
is
amazing
tons
of
bourbon
the
beer
pours
a
dark
murky
red
but
when
you
put
it
in
the
light
it
glows
a
gorgeous
ruby
the
beers
body
seems
clean
but
surprisingly
full
of
carbonation
bubbles
the
beer
pours
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
seems
to
be
turning
khaki
colored
it
mellows
down
to
a
half
of
a
fingers
width
as
the
beer
sits
in
the
glass
it
features
nice
legs
of
alcohol
as
you
swirl
it
in
the
glass
and
leaves
little
dots
of
thin
slippery
lacing
on
the
glass
wall
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
big
and
boozy
with
wonderfully
complex
notes
of
plum
fruit
toffee
slight
raisin
and
bourbon
sweet
notes
and
even
some
brown
sugar
notes
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
wonderfully
sweet
and
complex
with
boozy
alcohol
and
lovely
mellow
toffee
and
oak
notes
the
beer
begins
with
caramelly
malt
that
moves
into
toffee
light
bourbon
and
then
explodes
into
a
medley
of
all
those
flavors
adding
coconut
light
oak
very
faint
char
raisins
dates
and
brown
sugar
the
finish
is
a
little
harsh
with
booze
but
also
features
a
maple
syrup
sweet
taste
that
travels
into
the
sticky
aftertaste
you
can
definitely
feel
this
travelling
down
the
back
of
your
throat
but
i
think
with
a
bit
of
age
it
could
be
beautifully
mellowed
and
as
is
i
find
the
flavors
wonderfully
mellow
while
still
being
big
and
complex
as
it
warms
up
this
beer
definitely
builds
in
booziness
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
thick
and
chewy
but
soft
and
very
mellow
almost
fluffy
with
the
carbonation
almost
syrupy
its
body
sits
on
the
mellower
side
of
heavy
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
dry
with
alcohol
and
sticky
dry
saliva
overall
im
definitely
a
fan
of
this
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
right
now
and
i
would
love
to
find
another
bottle
and
set
it
away
for
a
couple
years
this
stuff
is
thick
boozy
and
complex
and
definitely
a
sipper
you
should
try
this
beer
o
one
of
the
best
bws
ive
ever
had
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
ease
of
consumption
and
generally
boozesoaked
sweet
notes
are
all
pulled
off
without
being
even
a
tad
overbearing
id
say
this
is
the
best
fw
beer
ive
had
but
i
still
have
a
parabola
and
sucaba
12
along
with
15
sitting
in
the
cellar
great
work
here
fw
better
and
better
every
year
mmm
mmm
great
barleywine
o
sucaba
is
a
testament
to
the
supremacy
of
firestone
walkers
barrel
program
rich
complex
and
nuanced
this
american
barleywine
is
at
the
top
of
its
class
will
be
interested
to
see
how
this
beer
drinks
with
time
get
a
hold
of
this
one
while
its
still
around
aged
in
refrigerated
cellar
ar
53deg
aged
1
5years
pours
a
nice
dark
walnut
shell
almost
pitchblack
atop
and
towards
the
bottom
of
the
pour
it
is
much
lighter
looking
with
the
brown
tones
much
more
apparent
head
is
still
there
and
seems
to
have
settled
slightly
however
still
very
active
lacing
is
spotty
bigpicadot
pattern
left
on
the
glass
here
possibly
the
best
looking
beerbarley
wine
for
sure
i
have
come
across
to
date
smell
is
toffee
high
quality
dark
cocoa
pecan
taste
is
dark
chocolate
first
then
toffee
then
some
ripe
pear
chestnut
hazelnut
cashew
then
a
little
roast
red
wine
and
some
bourbon
with
definite
oak
detected
in
the
finish
with
the
barrel
lending
its
impression
on
this
beer
heat
from
the
abc
lingers
and
adds
to
the
layers
of
flavor
that
go
well
here
such
as
adding
wine
or
cognac
or
vodka
in
to
lend
complexity
which
may
add
to
complexity
and
refinement
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
medium
bodied
and
the
malt
profile
here
is
impressive
overall
do
yourself
a
favor
and
serve
this
closer
to
room
temp
than
not
still
and
will
always
probably
be
my
favorite
barley
wines
merit
is
off
the
charts
here
food
that
pairs
with
chutneys
and
a
rich
flavor
complex
nutty
cheeses
such
as
aged
gouda
black
truffle
is
going
to
be
a
top
notch
match
for
this
beer
heavily
browned
or
buttered
and
earthyspiceful
dishes
dried
herbs
vs
fresh
herbs
smoked
or
grilled
vs
seared
something
that
can
stand
up
to
one
of
the
most
tasty
and
complex
beers
in
the
world
o
i
love
this
beer
it
is
a
fine
example
of
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
if
youre
a
bourbon
lover
this
one
is
for
you
o
overall
a
delicious
beer
lots
and
lots
of
bourbon
in
there
but
nothing
seems
out
of
whack
has
a
bit
of
heat
which
makes
me
want
to
age
some
for
a
while
cause
this
one
would
just
get
better
and
better
o
fantastic
glad
i
got
to
try
this
even
happier
that
i
have
another
bottle
downstairs
another
big
thanks
to
jzeilinger
for
cracking
a
bottle
of
this
brew
for
us
to
try
this
was
one
ive
wanted
to
try
for
a
while
and
im
honored
to
say
that
i
finally
had
it
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
amber
color
with
some
brown
hues
to
it
the
head
was
white
and
actually
stuck
around
for
a
little
while
there
was
a
light
lacing
on
the
glass
too
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
earthy
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
notes
along
with
some
hops
too
that
i
am
a
bit
surprised
to
pick
up
the
barrel
aging
also
comes
in
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
awesome
i
cant
even
explain
the
kind
of
flavors
i
experienced
here
there
is
some
serious
complexity
here
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
too
its
super
smooth
with
a
nice
subtle
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
was
great
there
is
no
doubt
that
i
will
buy
this
for
myself
one
day
to
have
it
again
i
miss
this
beer
already
and
its
only
been
a
few
hours
since
i
had
it
very
very
good
stuff
o
this
is
really
solid
id
love
to
do
the
pepsi
challenge
with
this
and
king
henry
o
really
incredible
i
know
this
is
young
but
i
had
to
try
it
now
last
week
i
had
the
2012
fsw
dbl
dba
and
it
is
a
phenom
so
im
not
concerned
as
much
that
this
sucaba
has
great
potential
because
of
the
fsw
barrel
brilliance
this
is
a
sipper
and
im
getting
a
pretty
good
whack
drinkable
now
and
i
got
two
for
the
cellar
well
definitely
see
you
next
year
this
is
an
epic
beer
and
worthy
of
all
the
praise
it
gets
firestone
walkers
mastery
of
barrelaging
is
a
joy
to
behold
o
simply
remarkable
its
one
of
those
beers
that
a
you
need
to
try
for
yourself
to
truly
understand
its
power
and
b
youll
never
forget
overall
an
amazing
beer
i
think
it
needs
time
and
i
am
glad
i
have
more
ill
be
back
in
a
year

happy

series
no

as
a
big
fan
of
firestone
walker
and
their
work
with
barrel
aging
i
was
excited
to
try
the
abacus
beer
though
a
very
solid
beer
all
around
i
personally
found
a
couple
of
undesirables
that
lessened
it
loftiness
not
the
least
the

tag
barrel
aging
can
be
finicky
and
i
may
have
drank
this
early
than
the
peak
date
but
i
will
likely
stick
with
other
firestone
walker
beers
4

o
may
sound
strange
but
almost
reminds
me
of
aw
rootbeer
with
a
touch
of
burbon
fantastic
beer
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
it
ages
over
the
next
few
months
this
is
a
well
balanced
full
flavored
beer
its
definitely
worth
savoring
each
sip
but
its
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
the
flavor
really
comes
alive
as
the
beer
warms
excellent
beer
i
will
never
miss
arctic
devil
with
this
in
the
cellar
smooth
boozy
and
certainly
a
benchmark
for
a
ba
barleywine
o
i
believe
fw
adds
wine
barrels
to
many
of
their
ba
lineup
and
i
think
they
are
what
adds
another
level
of
complexity
that
absolutely
blows
my
mind
with
a
year
on
it
this
beer
is
unbelievably
awesome
o
the
best
barleywine
out
there
this
beats
king
henry
and
mother
of
all
storms
in
my
opinion
o
overall
another
winner
by
firestone
having
just
had
thier
parabola
yesterday
anything
would
be
a
hard
act
to
follow
but
this
holds
steady
on
its
own
impressive
overall
a
very
nice
barleywine
with
lots
of
oak
barrel
enjoying
it
on
this
cold
winter
night
i
recall
this
being
a
bit
green
that
first
time
with
alcohol
being
astringent
and
the
malt
being
stickier
this
is
a
rich
treat
that
is
drinking
well
after
9
months
balanced
and
complex
a
must
have
for
the
cellar
you
may
resist
at
first
but
her
whispering
call
beckons
you
to
imbibe
o
like
i
said
nearly
perfect
its
comparable
to
lost
abbey
angels
share
bourbon
edition
but
with
better
carbonation
o
great
beer
bourbon
character
and
smoothness
are
spot
on
only
detraction
is
the
thin
mouthfeel
glad
i
still
have
a
couple
of
these
to
age
further
just
a
real
treat
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
while
pondering
the
world
of
craft
beers
overall
definitely
a
unique
barleywine
that
im
glad
i
could
try
be
forewarned
that
its
indeed
boozy
and
probably
doesnt
hide
it
as
well
as
some
others
in
its
class
this
is
last
years
bottle
so
ill
definitely
seek
out
a
fresh
one
in
a
few
months
to
compare
this
company
has
yet
to
let
me
down
and
are
one
of
the
best
out
there
ask
for
a
reccomendation
on
an
imperial
stout
or
barleywine
the
guy
said
this
was
one
of
his
faves
glad
i
listened
man
i
am
pleased
with
this
beer
i
didnt
expect
this
to
stand
up
to
the
sebago
bbbw
that
i
had
a
week
ago
but
it
certainly
has
i
have
been
quite
impressed
by
fw
yet
again
and
this
has
turned
be
back
into
a
barleywine
fan
again
o
deep
complex
and
balanced
superbly
this
barleywine
showcases
the
wonderful
malt
and
warm
alcohol
attributes
without
ever
pushing
the
limits
ucaba
is
worldclass
o
ive
got
to
say
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
i
was
looking
for
a
big
rich
malty
beer
but
what
i
got
was
basically
weaker
carbonated
bourbon
while
i
do
like
bourbon
and
i
do
like
bourbonbarrel
aged
beers
i
dont
like
my
beers
to
taste
only
like
bourbon
the
malt
and
hops
are
there
somewhat
but
they
are
completely
overshadowed
by
the
taste
and
aroma
of
bourbon
and
oak
the
only
reason
why
this
isnt
getting
a
lower
score
is
because
this
is
what
can
happen
with
english
barleywines
if
theyre
aged
long
enough
they
lose
some
of
the
malt
and
hop
characteristics
and
take
on
a
more
sherrylike
or
portlike
quality
however
while
i
can
understand
losing
some
hops
they
should
not
lose
this
much
malt
character
im
not
quite
sure
what
the
hype
is
all
about
with
this
beer
but
ive
had
better
barleywines
edit
31215
i
did
not
have
the
willpower
and
it
is
still
quite
delicious
2
5
years
later
holds
up
virtually
the
same
as
what
i
noticed
back
in
2012
o
great
beer
it
is
my
favorite
barley
wine
overall
a
massively
complex
beer
huge
dark
fruit
notes
covered
in
bourbon
and
sweet
toffee
just
enough
carbonation
and
tannins
to
clear
the
palate
and
make
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
expertly
balanced
between
huge
sweet
notes
and
strong
bourbon
and
heat
but
it
remains
extremely
smooth
even
as
it
warms
overall
this
is
fantastic
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
it
and
im
glad
i
bought
a
few
to
cellar
kind
of
weird
i
would
have
guessed
that
4a
had
more
age
than
4b
nonblind
thoughts
nailed
it
overall
paired
with
a
piece
of
sharp
cheddar
cheese
this
beer
is
great
as
far
as
english
barleywines
are
concerned
this
brew
is
up
on
top
of
the
food
chain
but
still
not
on
the
level
of
what
i
reviewed
last
night
i
dont
really
like
mentioning
other
beers
within
a
review
but
not
too
hard
to
look
up
if
you
see
you
buy
and
enjoy
what
quality
is
supposed
to
be
about
salud
m
its
full
bodied
but
not
as
vicious
as
a
stout
or
anything
the
little
carbonation
that
is
there
helps
bottle
poured
a
medium
clear
amber
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
bourbon
and
corn
is
very
deep
with
some
sweet
caramelized
malt
notes
taste
is
a
very
rich
mix
between
some
bourbon
notes
with
light
corn
ester
and
some
deep
caramelize
sugar
bourbon
is
intense
though
not
too
much
too
ruin
the
balanced
though
vanilla
notes
are
harder
to
distinguish
residual
sugar
is
also
not
too
overwhelming
and
some
attenuation
remains
to
keep
some
kind
of
balance
into
this
big
beer
well
done
and
something
i
would
have
again
big
flavorful
barleywine
quite
flavorful
the
bourbon
plays
well
with
the
base
beer
o
4
5
a
very
nice
display
of
some
fine
barrel
aging
and
blending
this
beer
is
yet
another
reason
why
firestone
continues
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
im
ecstatic
that
i
have
three
more
bottles
of
this
as
it
is
ridiculously
good
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
it
changes
over
the
next
couple
years
buy
a
couple
drink
one
now
and
then
squirrel
a
few
away
for
later
o
a
very
nice
barleywine
the
barrelaging
really
rounds
this
one
out
quite
a
bit
adding
complexity
without
the
alcohol
harshness
to
think
this
is
a
13
abv
beer
is
amazing
o
a
sweet
great
tasting
barleywine
not
overly
complex
but
well
balanced
and
delicious
the
bourbon
really
shines
here
without
adding
a
bunch
of
harsh
booziness

follows
the
aroma
quite

comes
in
waves

up

a
bit
of

bourbon
next
some
dark

wash

then
some

then
a

comes

a
semi

lingering
finish
medium

thick

with
a
light

moderate
level
of

and
a
sweet
almost
ashy

chalky
mouthfeel
this
one
is
a
sipper
thats
for
sure
but
im
going
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
enjoying
the
shit
out
of
this
overall
im
mixed
on
it
do
i
like
this
sure
am
i
wowed
or
really
impressed
no
not
really
a
bit
too
big
a
bit
too
sweet
and
a
bit
too
boozy
as
i
take
more
sips
however
i
am
a
little
bit
more
interested
in
it
and
finally
subtle
other
flavors

with

in
three
words
buy
this
beer
in
a
few
more
words
this
is
a
terrific
barleywine
that
was
a
real
pleasure
to
sip
and
enjoy
will
be
looking
for
this
again
real
thick
malts
on
the
nose
of
this
one
figs
are
in
there
as
well
but
as
an
accent
flavor
is
nice
smooth
and
fairly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
boozy
thing
to
it
maple
seems
evident
on
here
as
well
smooth
certainly
but
as
its
a
2011
it
could
probably
use
some
age
to
harness
some
complexity
as
it
stands
now
though
its
quite
good
few
barleywines
are
able
to
get
to
this
point
so
fresh
and
that
is
worth
noting
after
several
beers
before
this
and
drinking
them
too
fast
i
wanted

i
think
this
is
a
nearly
exceptional
barley
wine
i
might
pick
up
a
few
more
just
to
age
them
i
probably
would
not
say
barleywine
but
never
mind
this
is
a
treat
o
this
to
me
is
an
amazing
barleywine
great
job
of
kicking
the
tastes
up
to
extreme
levels
yet
keeping
the
body
restrained
a
bit
to
account
for
the
barleywine
this
beer
is
coming
in
a
little
hot
right
now
and
should
be
amazing
with
about
12
years
on
this
but
i
for
one
welcome
that
bourbon
love
the
lingering
taste
and
complexity
wow
what
can
i
say
a
beautiful
tawny
brown
garnet
highlights
and
a
slight
beige
head
that
lifted
exceptional
aromas
of
figs
currants
a
heavy
caramel
back
and
vanilla
touch
of
woodiness
is
apparent
in
the
background
but
the
vanilla
is
all
over
the
palate
a
very
balanced
mix
of
dark
fruits
and
malt
complements
the
sweet
vanilla
carbonation
is
perfect
it
melds
the
rich
body
of
the
beer
and
the
sweetness
into
a
smooth
and
velvety
feel
a
strong
sipper
that
renders
the
unwary
into
a
head
trip
delicious
o
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
more
when
it
warms
up
lots
of
different
flavors
intermixing
that
make
this
one
a
fun
evening
overall
pretty
damn
good
the
flavors
seemed
wellintegrated
but
man
is
this
beer
hot
right
now
give
this
a
few
years
and
im
sure
this
will
be
drinking
magnificently

this
beer
has
lost
some
richness
of
caramel
flavors
and
toffee
the
heat
has
not
faded
out
at
all
and
lost
some
depth
this
one
was
best
fresh
fo
sho
i
still
have
3
more
bottle
to
drink
will
report
any
further
changes
overall
i
love
barral
aged
beers
and
this
one
ranks
up
there
with
the
best
firestone
walker
does
some
amazing
stuff
with
barrals
all
pretentious
beer
reviewing
aside
heres
my
plain
old
opinion
i
go
with
barelywines
in
the
fall
almost
as
a
rule
just
because
of
the
intense
alcohol
and
full
bodied
flavor
im
almost
afraid
of
when
the
13
catches
up
to
me
because
frankly
i
dont
taste
it
this
is
just
a
fantastic
brew
hands
down
highly
recommended
to
even
those
who
arent
into
the
bourbon
aging
or
barleywine
scene
overall
just
superb
the
taste
was
an
incredibly
balanced
blend
rich
toffee
caramel
molasses
slight
cherry
and
bourbon
laden
toasty
malt
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
wellrounded
barrel
aged
barleywines
ive
ever
sampled
the
mouthfeel
was
exceptionally
smooth
and
creamy
full
bodied
with
light
carbonation
the
13
abv
provides
a
hearty
warmth
to
the
finish
but
it
is
by
no
means
overpowering
or
out
of
place
overall
this
is
an
incredible
brew
o
had
this
badboy
twice
with
different
results
the
first
time
the
smell
and
taste
completely
blew
me
away
it
was
a
perfectly
crafted
beer
i
had
this
again
a
few
days
later
and
it
was
totally
different
the
smell
was
the
same
but
the
taste
was
dominated
with
alcohol
and
it
only
intensified
as
the
beer
warmed
im
going
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
and
rereview
it
as
of
now
this
is
still
a
must
drink
beer
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet

o
im
glad
i
got
this
review
out
of
the
way
ive
got
several
more
bottles
of
this
that
i
can
now
sit
back
and
enjoy
and
share
with
others
but
ill
probably
wait
till
the
cooler
months
cant
wait
overall
firestone
walker
always
impresses
me
with
their
brews
another
offering
that
i
just
love
this
one
will
definitely
age
with
the
best
of
them
i
can
only
see
this
beer
gaining
in
complexity
over
time
i
suppose
this
is
the
only
bottled
abacus
well
ever
see
looking
forward
to
what
its
called
next
year
o
a
really
outstanding
beer
ive
never
really
had
anything
like
this
theres
enough
going
on
to
keep
the
bottle
changing
and
interesting
the
entire
time
i
bought
two
bottles
and
cant
wait
to
break
out
the
second
one
in
a
few
years
o
very
good
barleywine
which
tatses
less
than
the
actual
abv
but
leaves
you
feeling
nice
once
the
glass
is
finished
overall
a
good
specimen
would
definately
try
again
overall
this
is
a
fine
fine
beer
no
doubt
its
a
great
example
in
my
mind
of
how
bourbon
barrels
can
enhance
rather
than
overshadow
a
good
base
beer
that
said
for
the
price
id
probably
rather
buy
a
6
pack
of
bells
third
coast
old
ale
but
as
an
occasional
splurge
this
is
pretty
great
o
one

barleywines
out

goes
out
to

this
one

tasting

served
from
bottle
into
a
duckrabbit
snifter
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
and
booze
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
alcohol
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
booziness
on
this
one
definitely
started
to
show
its
face
as
it
warmed
up
a
very
nice
flavor
on
this
one
i
was
worried
i
wouldnt
like
this
one
as
much
based
on
the
aroma
alone
but
the
flavor
was
very
nice
in
comparison
really
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
tick
this
one
thanks
given2flybrewing
t
theres
so
much
going
on
im
speechless
great
rich
mouthfeel
with
notes
of
vanilla
caramel
coconut
toffee
and
butterscotch
theres
a
slight
warmness
but
this
hides
the
alcohol
pretty
well
by
far
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
period
absolutely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
o
fantastic
barleywine
probably
best
ive
had
so
far
strong
flavor
that
is
not
too
offensive
o
its
hard
to
describe
how
much
im
enjoying
this
beer
a
great
beer
from
firestone
im
glad
they
finally
bottled
it
im
going
to
be
searching
for
more
o
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
while
it
gets
a
good
rating
i
was
hoping
for
just
a
touch
more
sweetness
and
a
little
less
bourbon
by
comparison
alpine
great
blows
this
away
in
terms
of
sweetness
and
complexity
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
and
and
well
balanced
beers
ive
had
up
to
this
point
the
barrel
aging
takes
it
to
another
dimension
as
opposed
to
dominating
the
bourbon
serves
as
the
ultimate
compliant
rich
smooth
and
absolutely
delectable
simply
stunning
on
every
level
truly
impressed
by
this
beer
o
delicious
and
complex
id
love
to
come
back
to
this
one
in
say
10
years
o
very
nice
complex
beer
nise
and
taste
is
big
and
is
very
nice
overallnotes
i
cant
be
a
jedi
because
tonight
i
experienced
a
love
so
passionate
that
i
cant
describe
it
lovely
beer
all
around
with
only
one
or
two
equaling
it
and
none
surpassing
this
goes
well
a
good
dark
cigar
that
sweats
recommended
on
those
special
days
where
you
feel
as
if
your
life
is
going
in
the
perfect
direction
my
god
this
is
a
bold
fruity
alcohol
forward
barleywine
that
is
hurt
a
bit
in
drinkability
it
is
medium
bodied
and
modestly
carbonated
clearly
a
decent
representation
of
the
american
style
with
its
modest
hop
inclusion
the
alcohol
is
not
hiding
in
this
brew
at
all
it
is
forward
in
both
flavor
and
warming
factor
it
is
a
solid
brew
but
i
was
let
down
a
bit
perhaps
my
anticipation
and
hype
built
this
brew
up
to
something
more
magnificent
than
it
ever
could
be
oh
well
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
some
2
years
since
i
first
heard
about
it
along
the
way
i
got
to
try
a
small
draft
sample
and
that
just
didnt
satisfy
my
curiosity
i
just
about
gave
up
hope
of
ever
getting
a
real
taste
since
it
was
at
the
time
draft
only
then
the
announcement
came
that
it
was
going
to
be
bottled
perhaps
a
bit
fresh
at
the
moment
i
intend
to
revisit
this
one
with
some
age
overal
this
has
got
to
be
the
best
barleywine
that
i
have
had
to
date
the
mouthful
is
so
creamy
and
wonderful
this
beer
keeps
getting
better
with
age
very
complex
very
impressed
a
good
ba
barleywine
but
ive
definitely
had
better
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
it
first
time
ive
had
it
as
the
first
beer
of
the
night
and
i
think
it
could
definitely
benefit
from
a
little
aging
as
it
is
now
one
person
would
definitely
have
some
work
to
do
to
make
it
through
the
whole
bottle
even
sharing
this
with
someone
else
is
taking
awhile
to
drink
not
really
readily
available
but
i
managed
to
get
a
few
bottles
from
downtown
pours
a
very
attractive
deep
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
tanbrown
head
a
wonderful
nose
of
barrel
caramel
vanilla
maple
syrup
candy
sweet
malts
and
a
gentle
waft
of
alcohol
full
bodied
creamy
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
for
its
size
worth
the
hype
absolutely
easily
my
new
favorite
in
the
barrel
aged
bw
style
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
this
beer
is
interesting
as
the
bourbon
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
but
the
13
at
the
end
sort
of
does
while
the
fruits
really
take
this
to
a
new
level
the
combination
of
them
with
the
solvent
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
still
its
a
great
beer
that
has
a
nice
barrelaged
profile
but
dont
be
surprised
when
this
beer
bites
back
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
great
winter
weather
sipper
i
assume
it
will
get
thicker
and
sweeter
as
it
ages
i
guess
i
will
find
out
though
firestone
walker
does
it
again
4
5
pours
a
dark
brown
not
glass
or
shine
to
it
a
little
ugly
a
light
beige
head
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
not
as
good
as
i
as
expecting
cant
really
tell
it
was
barrelaged
at
all
molasses
mostly
a
hint
of
hops
again
cant
really
tell
this
is
barrelaged
a
little
bourbon
lots
of
chocolate
caramel
and
vanilla
hoppy
bourbon
finish
good
not
the
greatness
i
was
expecting
o
this
is
a
monster
of
a
barleywine
the
alcohol
is
there
but
really
pretty
subdued
great
to
be
able
to
buy
this
off
the
shelf
in
the
chi
if
this
is
what
firestone
can
do
with
a
barrelaged
barleywine
then
my
anticipation
for
parabola
is
spiking
into
the
stratosphere
i
enjoy
the
anniversary
blends
but
i
think
beers
like
this
really
showcase
this
brewerys
mastery
of
the
barrels
a
brown
liquid
with
a
reddish
tint
less
than
half
a
finger
of
slightly
off
white
head
nose
is
malty
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
obviously
its
a
barleywine
so
carbonation
is
non
existent
taste
is
right
on
with
the
smell
big
toffee
and
caramel
notes
almost
like
a
coconut
on
the
finish
basically
a
tasty
damn
liquid
candy
bar
very
happy
to
try
this
this
beer
is
very
dark
and
has
a
minimal
head
it
leaves
no
lacing
or
legs
not
that
impressive
but
who
the
hell
cares
how
this
beer
looks
the
aroma
is
great
dark
fruits
caramel
toffee
coffee
chocolate
and
oak
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
burn
but
it
is
not
too
apparent
the
taste
too
is
great
surprisingly
light
and
nuanced
for
such
a
big
beer
great
oak
bourbon
presence
good
chocolate
caramel
molasses
and
toffee
flavor
firestone
walker
really
knows
how
to
use
bal
aging
to
enhance
a
beer
instead
of
taking
it
over
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
approximately
medium
bodied
mild
sweetness
but
nothing
that
overwhelms
the
palate
drinking
a
whole
bomber
of
this
by
myself
was
not
as
difficult
as
i
thought
it
might
be
does
not
get
heavy
or
cloying
really
well
made
beer
not
bad
aromas
were
wonderful
taste
was
a
bit
too
hot
and
one
sided
but
still
pretty
good
drinkability
love
beers
that
blow
you
away
liek
this
what
a
treat
o
very
complex
and
unique
i
could
not
stop
from
going
back
for
more
overall
really
awesome
beer
very
impressed
with
this
one
as
it
did
live
up
to
the
hype
pretty
drinkable
as
well
a
very
tasty
treat
an
outstanding
ba
barleywine
for
sure
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
stretches
the
barleywine
style
flavors
are
very
strong
and
make
you
notice
them
the
alcohol
takes
away
from
the
experience
and
definitely
needs
to
be
toned
down
at
the
lark
having
a
beer
sampler
my
favorite
is
firestone
walker
abacus
13
abv
really
good
with
caramel
taste
and
aroma
dark
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
an
excellent
barleywine
unexpectedly
good
taste
flavor
mouthfeel
and
aroma
who
would
of
thought
i
would
have
liked
a
barleywine
style
beer
o
excellent
barleywine
in
my
book
the
smooth
alcohol
sugars
and
sweetness
were
just
right
for
me
i
cant
believe
how
smooth
this
is
right
out
of
the
gate
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
one
ages
recommend
im
very
torn
on
this
one
i
usually
like
a
challenging
barleywine
and
this
is
so
smooth
and
easy
especially
for
a
beer
with
13
abv
theres
a
very
strong
warming
but
its
very
pleasant
without
a
trace
of
burning
the
flavor
is
strong
and
clear
all
the
way
to
the
end
but
its
hard
to
call
it
really
complex
its
not
a
chore
to
finish
nor
difficult
aside
from
the
abv
but
it
did
get
almost
boring
fantastic
as
a
single
glass
so
the
bottle
is
definitely
something
to
share
it
certainly
wasnt
as
deep
or
dark
as
black
swan
my
movie
pairing
of
choice
but
it
is
certainly
as
mentally
debilitating
wow
what
a
great
beer
pours
a
dark
tawny
port
with
the
faintest
wisp
of
a
head
which
quickly
departs
poured
this
gem
at
about
55
degrees
into
a
tulip
the
nose
hits
you
with
a
complex
mix
of
rum
soaked
raisins
figs
buttery
caramel
rich
toffee
slightly
smoked
oaky
vanilla
with
a
classic
fortified
wine
oxidizedrancio
note
really
impressed
the
taste
brings
a
mouthfilling
richness
with
almond
roca
toasted
coconut
candy
dark
caramel
and
finishes
with
a
satisifying
mouthcoating
oilyness
and
just
enough
carbonation
there
is
a
slight
note
of
alcohol
at
the
end
but
for
being
13
it
is
barely
perceptible
at
that
degree
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
before
i
opened
it
and
often
i
think
i
set
myself
up
for
failure
with
such
high
expectations
abacus
though
did
not
let
me
down
overalli
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
really
well
balanced
and
a
great
sipper
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sipping
on
a
nice
bourbon
i
believe
this
one
should
age
really
well
o
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ever
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
overall
solid
beer
not
quite
sure
why
there
is
all
the
hype
around
this
beer
its
not
bad
but
not
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
given
the
ingredients
and
the
taste
this
should
certainly
be
classified
as
an
english
barleywine
i
can
have
a
good
quantity
of
a
lot
of
different
beers
but
there
is
no
way
in
hell
i
would
be
able
to
finish
a
whole
bomber
of
this
one
in
one
sitting
overall
i
bought
some
bottles
i
cant
wait
to
compare
i
wish
i
could
have
bought
a
whole
glass
o
this
one
is
tough
to
rate
the
nose
and
taste
are
amazing
2nd
only
to
moas
in
my
experience
the
carbonation
issues
detract
from
the
beer
slightly
though
i
also
think
this
is
more
of
an
english
barleywine
than
american
unless
the
barrel
aging
has
significantly
muted
the
hops
still
damn
tasty
and
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
to
drink
over
the
next
year
aging
a
few
cant
wait
to
try
the
next
edit
from
314
bier
stein
recently
had
a
4
year
vertical
in
honor
of
the
2014
release
the
best
of
the
bunch
was
easiiy
the
2011
though
none
of
the
years
were
exactly
awful
the
current
rating
is
based
on
my
review
of
that
vintage
now
that
its
4
years
old
o
this
will
be
great
with
age
said
the
same
about
fw
14th
well
see
about
that
looking
forward
to
having
a
bottle
in
2
years
or
so
o
a
good
beer
really
enjoyed
it
on
the
second
run
and
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
chance
to
have
it
very
solid
get
this
one
if
you
can
easier
now
with
expanded
production
originally
4
0
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slick
with
a
bit
of
coating
left
in
the
mouth
after
sips
body
is
between
medium
and
full
and
is
just
enough
to
hold
up
the
taste
drinkability
is
fine
but
the
finish
is
so
rich
and
fully
flavored
that
it
gets
tough
to
down
after
a
bit
still
great
beer
o
firestone
continues
to
impress
with
their
reserve
series
parabola
was
and
still
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
this
one
is
almost
that
good
certainly
one
of
the
best
barleywines
that
ive
ever
had
another
reason
that
i
wish
i
still
lived
on
the
west
coast
o
one
of
the
top
beers
i
have
ever
had
amazing
beer
worth
the
hype
and
praise
also
worthy
of
its
price
have
four
stored
away
for
aging
and
special
occasions
that
i
am
looking
very
forward
to
cheers
love
this
amazing
barleywine
absolutely
stunning
beer
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
barleywine
the
flavor
shows
amazing
complexity
and
integration
there
is
a
bit
of
warming
booziness
but
it
adds
more
character
opposed
to
becoming
abrasive
very
smooth
overall
a
definite
sipper
flat
out
awesome
beer
great
work
fw
o
very
good
brew
perfect
balance
between
booziness
and
drinkability
highly
recommend
this
tastes
fantastic
but
one
for
sipping
and
sharing
i
could
see
it
with
creamier
cheeses
brie
and
raspberry
could
also
pair
with
steak
pours
a
clear
yellowish
brown
not
much
head
noth
really
special
appearance
smells
bourbony
and
boozy
lacking
on
the
nose
tastes
sweet
and
bourbon
heavy
definitely
too
boozy
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
see
it
at
23
years
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
a
bit
lacking
as
well
overall
is
good
but
not
great
overall
possibly
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
incredible
balance
and
great
integration
of
the
barrel
really
set
this
beer
apart
i
only
wish
i
had
a
couple
more
bottles
overall
fairly
pricey
but
i
cant
remember
being
this
impressed
with
any
other
barleywine
ive
had
recently
im
glad
i
bought
two
so
that
i
can
see
what
some
age
does
this
one
overall
excellent
brew
well
worth
the
asking
price
this
should
be
savoured
like
a
fine
cognac
and
should
be
shared
with
great
friends
recommended
just
amazing
mouthfeel
pick
up
all
the
tasting
notes
but
also
a
slickness
glides
off
the
palate
comes
and
goes
without
an
aftertaste
backlash
this
stuff
is
excellent
now
makes
me
a
little
leery
about
aging
it
can
it
really
get
any
better
d
for
a
13
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
a
little
heat
but
nothing
another
6
months
cant
cure
very
impressed
overall
it
drinks
like
a
high
end
bourbon
very
smooth
and
complex
the
high
abv
is
prevalent
but
necessary
in
a
drink
like
this
its
a
sipper
take
your
time
and
enjoy
cheers
overall
i
messed
up
not
picking
up
more
bottles
of
this
gem
of
a
beer
can
only
imagine
with
another
year
what
this
will
taste
like
does
not
taste
like
any
barleywines
i
have
had
but
who
cares
with
this
symphony
of
taste
and
smell
this
beer
makes
work
on
tap
at
cloverleaf
what
a
bw
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
color
with
a
caramel
colored
head
has
an
aroma
of
bourbon
dark
fruit
caramel
and
perhaps
some
earthiness
has
a
sweet
dark
fruit
taste
with
notes
of
caramel
and
chocolate
a
nice
hop
layer
creamy
mouthfeel
excellent
medium
bodied
with
a
hint
of
soft
carbonation
enough
to
prevent
this
beer
from
being
a
sticky
mess
on
your
tongue
the
finish
goes
on
forever
mainly
the
barrel
characteristics
and
a
touch
of
toffee
for
such
a
big
barleywine
this
beer
is
not
overly
sweet
at
this
point
so
the
blend
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
soon
after
release
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
can
really
tell
that
this
was
a
base
for
10
on
its
on
it
stands
tall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
you
just
have
to
like
sweet
booziness
pours
a
dark
crimson
reddark
brown
with
a
very
very
small
tan
head
that
fades
to
nothing
the
head
came
out
very
fizzy
much
like
a
soda
no
lacing
whatsoever
on
the
drink
down
the
smell
coming
off
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic
caramel
toffee
butterscotch
brown
sugar
cherry
coconut
earthy
woods
all
come
out
of
the
glass
i
spent
about
5
minutes
just
smelling
this
beer
before
i
even
took
a
sip
not
surprisingly
the
taste
is
out
of
this
world
the
first
taste
that
i
get
is
toasted
coconut
this
is
followed
by
sweet
carameltoffee
candied
cherries
and
very
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
there
is
an
aftertaste
of
some
woody
notes
from
the
barrels
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
which
i
think
helps
it
from
being
too
thick
and
cloying
this
is
by
far
the
best
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
the
13
abv
is
really
not
noticeable
at
all
the
aromas
and
flavors
mesh
together
amazingly
well
i
have
2
more
of
these
in
my
cellar
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
these
age
i
am
going
to
seek
more
of
these
out
for
sure
o
for
a
barrel
aged
beer
this
one
is
pretty
smooth
and
properly
balanced
im
not
a
whiskey
fan
but
i
wasnt
overpowered
by
the
ammonialike
whiskey
bite
a
nice
smooth
mellowed
dark
beer
overall
an
exceptional
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
d
this
is
a
sipper
but
thats
what
bws
are
for
overall
this
is
a
killer
barleywine
has
a
wonderful
array
of
flavors
and
a
desertlike
quality
that
can
be
rare
in
such
a
style
overall
not
the
prettiest
beer
but
is
quite
nice
and
a
bomber
worth
sharing
with
some
fellow
beer
advocates
o
very
good
beer
it
is
still
pretty
hot
at
the
moment
but
it
is
still
a
very
easy
drinking
barrel
aged
barleywine
i
am
really
glad
i
made
the
long
trek
down
to
capones
to
try
it
o
i
tried
very
hard
to
give
this
a
honest
review
being
im
a
huge
ran
of
firestone
i
was
able
to
have
a
glass
on
tap
at
the
tasting
room
but
this
is
a
review
from
the
bottle
i
got
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
and
will
be
able
to
let
this
age
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
in
2012
edit
updated
scores
and
notes
after
having
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
anniversary
party
on
512011
d
drank
really
well
considering
how
hot
it
was
at
the
moment
and
would
welcome
some
of
this
brew
anytime
good
job
firestone
d
not
much
needs
to
be
said
about
this
beer
other
than
its
great
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
in
sips
fantastic
i
love
this
stuff
please
give
me
another
this
one
is
definately
a
sipper
sticky
thick
mouthfeel
that
coats
the
entire
mouth
with
every
drink
the
high
alcohol
is
definately
subdued
and
i
was
able
to
finish
the
entire
bottle
by
myself
selfish
maybe
a
little
bit
this
beer
was
definately
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
drank
in
awhile
do
a
slow
sipper
not
something
to
take
lightly
13
is
alot
and
it
shows
fw
knows
their
way
around
a
barrel
3
years
is
insane
yet
this
remains
a
balanced
beer
and
not
a
booze
bomb
tried
this
on
tap
the
first
go
round
and
went
out
immediately
and
bought
2
bottles
a
very
good
brew
for
an
evening
sipper
round
the
fireplace
or
just
in
front
of
the
tv
very
worthy
brew
worth
treating
yourself
to
this
one
comments
from
others
are
on
the
mark
first
barleywine
ive
ever
tried
i
need
to
seek
more
abacus
pours
surprisingly
dark
for
the
style
its
almost
stout
black
one
or
two
cherry
spots
do
shine
through
when
the
beer
is
held
to
light
though
the
khaki
colored
head
is
thin
and
disappears
quickly
without
a
trace
the
nose
is
heavy
on
bourbon
albeit
good
smooth
bourbon
with
toffee
and
vanilla
in
the
background
each
sip
brings
forth
a
fantastic
blend
of
toffee
milk
chocolate
vanilla
toasted
coconut
and
bourbon
no
one
flavor
consistently
dominates
every
time
i
bring
the
glass
to
my
lips
any
one
of
these
flavors
is
liable
to
steal
though
if
i
had
to
nitpick
though
id
say
that
the
bourbon
is
just
a
little
too
boozy
right
now
the
body
is
full
and
rich
and
creamy
without
becoming
over
the
top
or
lending
a
cloying
sensation
to
the
beer
that
may
be
at
least
in
part
thanks
to
a
surprisingly
active
carbonation
that
feels
quite
fine
on
my
tongue
it
helps
give
a
life
to
the
beer
that
is
lacking
any
other
opposition
to
malty
goodness
bottled
abacus
is
quite
good
at
this
still
young
point
in
time
but
it
doesnt
quite
reach
the
subtle
excellence
of
both
the
draft
version
and
what
i
think
bottles
will
turn
into
in
a
few
years
if
there
were
more
id
go
get
it
there
is
not
so
i
will
wait
until
i
can
get
some
and
when
its
here
ill
rush
to
it
overall
i
never
expected
this
to
be
so
disgustingly
good
they
say
it
is
a
barleywine
hardly
but
whatever
it
is
oh
dear
god
it
is
delicious
smooth
and
outrageously
drinkable
enticing
and
engaging
just
rightly
sweet
woodsy
bourbony
beautiful
seriously
for
a
13
brew
this
is
immensely
poundable
and
delicious
need
more
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
brew
thanks
eric
i
want
more
im
stuck
in
that
unique
but
welcome
hell
that
is
having
a
beer
thats
so
fantastic
so
ageable
so
alreadyopen
and
so
finite
guess
its
time
to
enjoy
we
definitely
stopped
what
we
were
doing
a
few
times
to
marvel
about
it
bounce
back
tastes
and
try
and
pin
things
down
the
bourbon
the
chocolate
the
vanilla
the
dark
fruit
the
balance
of
all
of
these
working
together
captured
with
just
the
right
gravity
an
amazing
beer
that
happily
made
me
eat
my
words
now
if
they
can
just
fix
the
typos
all
over
that
brown
box
o
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
you
can
get
a
hint
of
the
booze
in
the
nose
but
you
cant
really
taste
it
i
expected
it
to
be
a
heavily
hopped
boozy
mess
but
it
was
well
constructed
and
balanced
and
extremely
good
not
quite
as
ready
to
go
out
of
the
literal
box
as
parabola
was
the
heat
on
this
needs
time
to
cool
down
but
this
still
ehas
traces
of
the
typical
fw
balance
and
deliciousness
of
their
ba
beers
well
this
beer
sure
looks
the
best
of
all
of
the
other
barleywines
set
before
us
hopefully
its
a
sign
of
things
to
come
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
color
with
an
ecru
finger
surfacing
this
pretty
beer
the
aromatics
are
oak
barrel
caramel
fig
and
raisin
it
was
actually
pretty
weak
on
all
those
fronts
as
well
because
the
smells
were
so
good
is
the
reason
it
gets
the
rating
it
does
the
flavor
matches
the
same
with
the
nose
it
good
mellow
sweet
and
has
all
the
characteristics
youd
look
for
in
a
quality
barleywine
but
it
feels
so
standard
i
think
it
could
have
been
smoother
but
it
was
still
really
easy
to
drink
overall
this
was
a
very
excellent
beer
but
it
felt
like
something
was
missing
from
making
it
world
class
it
drinks
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
is
a
smooth
ride
if
you
dont
mind
the
river
of
fire
flowing
through
it
is
this
tasty
good
mouthfeel
even
with
the
low
carbonation
very
full
and
enriching
to
my
life
the
caramel
coats
the
tongue
and
inside
the
cheeks
plunging
into
the
spots
between
teeth
seeking
all
the
places
to
hide
forever
and
i
willing
participant
allow
it
i
do
allow
it
md
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
it
was
overall
too
sweet
and
too
boozy
for
me
tasty
and
there
is
a
lot
going
on
but
i
could
have
used
less
booze
and
more
hops
to
even
this
out
firestone
maintains
its
standard
of
excellence
for
barrelaged
brews
this
is
one
fine
ba
barleywine
glad
to
have
a
couple
more
very
interested
to
see
how
this
stacks
up
after
a
little
time
in
the
cellar
to
cool
it
off
a
bit
i
had
this
on
tap
as
well
and
it
was
about
the
same
in
fact
i
was
hoping
the
bottle
would
be
better
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
for
some
time
but
its
kind
of
a
disappointment
im
not
sure
age
would
really
help
either
as
the
flavors
are
fairly
mellow
as
it
is
underneath
the
hot
bourbon
i
havent
busted
out
an
abacus
since
seventh
grade
math
class
lets
hope
this
beer
tops
those
memories
not
much
of
a
challenge
really
it
pours
a
dark
garnetbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sharp
caramel
mild
cocoa
graham
crackers
and
butterscotch
the
taste
reunites
all
of
these
elements
while
simultaneously
introducing
them
to
a
few
newbies
ruby
red
grapefruit
orange
peel
and
mandarin
orange
flesh
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
oily
sorta
syrupy
feel
overall
a
morethansolid
bwine
though
im
not
sure
it
deserves
all
of
the
praise
it
gets
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
some
tasty
stuff
but
there
are
many
better
barleywines
more
readily
available
o
compared
to
parabola
which
i
realize
is
a
different
style
this
offering
from
firestone
walker
is
overall
a
big
dissapointment
so
hot
that
the
alcohol
seems
to
cover
everything
in
the
nose
taste
and
feel
i
recommend
sitting
on
this
one
for
a
very
long
time
theres
a
great
beer
behind
that
heat
somewhere
superb
very
creamy
and
an
excellent
delivery
system
for
the
high
abv
this
is
a
sipper
but
a
great
one
at
that
pours
a
dark
color
only
noticing
the
deep
mahogany
hues
when
held
against
a
light
nice
cap
of
tan
colored
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
scent
brings
wonderul
notes
of
fine
burbon
oak
warm
vanilla
sugar
rich
dark
chocolate
ripe
black
cherry
coconut
leather
while
beers
with
this
nose
tend
to
be
harsh
and
warm
it
was
nothing
but
smooth
all
of
the
flavors
blend
perfectly
the
barrel
againg
is
the
star
and
fw
has
this
method
down
while
a
fantastic
malt
profile
is
the
base
of
the
beer
i
cant
get
beyond
the
oak
warmn
vanilla
sugar
cocount
an
burbon
while
most
barelywines
seem
to
go
for
clean
and
bright
malts
this
definitely
brings
in
some
from
the
darker
side
chocolate
char
earth
and
spice
present
themselves
body
is
full
smooth
and
creamy
no
lingering
tastes
on
the
palate
moderate
carbonation
fantastic
beer
which
i
would
love
to
secure
another
bottle
of
and
let
sit
for
a
while
this
is
a
fantastic
ba
barleywine
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
long
time
fw
certainly
knows
their
way
around
barrel
aging
world
class
notes
not
the
14th
anniversary
but
who
would
complaint
when
something
is
this
extraordinary
sure
enough
one
needs
to
be
into
barrel
aged
complex
and
boozy
brews
but
this
is
another
highlight
ill
keep
a
bottle
maybe
two
for
the
aging
if
i
can
but
itll
be
difficult
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
now
that
this
is
one
you
absolutely
need
to
seek
out
i
feel
honored
that
fw
is
finally
in
the
philadelphia
market
because
it
will
be
hard
to
keep
my
hands
off
this
stuff
if
you
want
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
done
right
look
no
further
abacus
is
your
answer
o
my
first
abacus
and
im
blown
away
to
me
this
brew
is
like
the
abyss
of
the
barleywines
so
deep
so
complex
i
am
very
glad
i
bought
2
of
these
and
if
theres
anymore
on
the
shelf
when
i
go
back
i
might
buy
2
more
great
amazing
barrel
aged
barleywine
full
syrupy
body
milder
carbonation
sticky
velvet
smoothness
which
wraps
around
the
tongue
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
i
ended
up
having
multiple
glasses
bc
i
simply
couldnt
get
enough
excellent
flavor
awesome
bourbon
barrel
usage
one
of
the
best
barleywines
or
barrel
aged
beers
ive
ever
had
truly
remarkable
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
i
have
no
doubt
this
will
age
wonderfully
if
i
can
let
it
this
ones
worthy
of
the
hype
its
one
of
if
not
the
best
american
barleywine
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
lighting
was
somewhat
pour
but
beer
was
very
dark
minimal
head
smell
was
sweet
with
a
light
bourbon
hint
taste
was
similar
with
hints
of
vanilla
bourbon
molasses
dark
fruit
very
smooth
and
refined
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
alcohol
presence
was
very
well
hidden
and
almost
no
warming
sensation
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
and
i
was
quite
surprised
how
well
rounded
it
was
medium
bodied
with
the
perfect
balance
of
earthy
barrel
character
boozy
bourbon
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
heat
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
prominent
barrel
presence
up
front
earthy
oak
that
is
slightly
toasted
with
sweet
bourbon
flavor
that
is
prominent
but
not
overly
hot
although
the
bourbon
flavor
is
strong
its
not
overpowering
and
the
other
flavors
are
able
to
stand
out
there
are
also
notes
of
vanilla
and
toasted
coconut
from
the
barrel
mellowing
things
out
slightly
hot
with
some
nice
burning
warmth
in
the
finish
but
the
abv
is
pretty
well
masked
at
13
underneath
there
is
a
nice
blend
of
earthyleathery
and
sweet
malt
flavor
slightly
earthy
barleywine
flavor
with
hints
of
sweet
caramel
toffee
rye
and
faint
cocoa
vinous
with
dark
fruit
flavor
especially
dark
cherry
as
well
as
some
grape
plum
raisin
and
fig
more
heat
toward
the
end
of
the
swallow
but
this
beer
is
excellently
balanced
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
beers
ive
ever
had
amazing
o
im
totally
digging
this
brew
and
i
had
been
hoping
for
good
thing
and
this
far
exceeded
my
expectations
one
of
the
best
ba
bw
ive
come
across
its
super
easy
to
drink
yet
at
the
same
time
you
could
spend
all
day
picking
it
to
pieces

wonderful

light

vanilla

not
sure
if
any
of
this
was
brandy
barrel
aged
but
i
get
it
in
the
aroma
some
light
cherry
notes
a
decent
amount
of
bourbon
some
light
alcohol
a
light
leather
note
and
a
bit
of
oak
the
barrels
certainly
come
through
in
the
aroma
all
of
the
different
aromas
work
quite
nicely
together
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
caramel
brown
sugar
coconut
and
vanilla
then
a
little
brandy
and
a
light

comes
through
as
well

a
bit

on
the
finish
with
a
light

much
less
than
you

for

very
well
for
the
beer
overall
a
great
beer
probably
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
had
so
far
the
barrels
certainly
dominate
the
nose
and
taste
which
i
quite
enjoy
i
found
myself
not
wanting
to
finish
my
glass
just
so
i
could
continue
to
enjoy
the
aroma
for
a
few
extra
minutes
if
you
get
the
chance
abacus
is
absolutely
worth
the
try
the
barrel
aging
makes
this
beer
amazing
i
would
love
the
chance
to
try
this
with
3
years
of
age
overall
impressed
and
looking
forward
to
tasting
improvements
with
my
cellared
bottle
nice
bourbon
presence
that
isnt
too
inyourface
o
a
really
good
beer
and
barleywine
the
13
is
felt
in
the
buzz
but
you
dont
really
notice
it
while
youre
drinking
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
a
great
beer
d
smooth
rich
huge
and
so
drinkable
for
13
percent
this
is
a
tasty
beer
as
it
warmed
the
whiskey
notes
really
became
more
evident
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
this
tastes
like
candy
then
theres
chocolate
further
back
in
the
mouth
and
cherry
in
the
finish
this
is
very
very
smooth
and
not
at
all
cloying
it
should
be
sipped
slowly
but
its
hard
not
to
drink
it
faster
than
an
13
beer
ought
to
be
update
had
it
on
draft
last
week
and
its
even
better
all
of
the
flavors
were
amplified
especially
the
sweetbread
toffee
and
strawberries
my
inspiration
had
led
me
to
conclude
this
ranks
with
parabola
as
fsws
top
specialtyrelease
o
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
so
smooth
and
delicious
i
know
that
this
beer
is
pretty
fresh
but
i
am
so
glad
that
i
have
a
few
bottles
to
age
because
i
know
it
is
going
to
get
better
considering
the
high
abv
i
am
just
downing
this
beer
great
just
great
o
another
great
beer
from
firestone
walker
and
yet
another
reason
to
do
my
beer
shopping
other
than
in
connecticut
drinkability
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
its
no
parabola
its
hotter
more
astringent
and
a
little
less
flavorful
and
at
13
0
its
going
to
kick
your
ass
if
youre
not
careful
and
maybe
even
if
you
are
drink
this
one
with
food
specifically
with
dessert
and
dont
drink
it
alone
if
you
can
help
it
i
think
this
beer
could
be
a
lot
more
if
they
became
a
little
more
focused
with
the
barrel
aging
and
maybe
even
a
little
more
focused
with
the
baseline
malts
and
hop
profile
thinking
back
on
the
big
picture
of
this
beer
makes
it
even
a
little
more
hazy
regardless
on
the
whole
its
definitely
an
above
average
brew
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
though
i
question
its
price
tag
o
overall
im
glad
i
was
able
to
find
several
of
these
to
lay
down
in
the
cellar
as
i
really
feel
this
will
get
better
with
age
definitely
one
of
the
better
bourbon
barrel
barleywines
out
there
overall
this
beer
is
what
i
would
hope
and
expect
a
harry
potter
butterbeer
tastes
like
it
is
sweet
nutty
and
buttery
i
had
no
idea
that
this
beer
would
be
this
good
it
is
far
better
than
mother
of
all
storms
and
is
much
more
on
par
with
my
favorites
kuhnhenn
bbbw
and
central
waters
bbbw
the
etoh
burn
is
prominent
in
this
one
but
i
would
love
to
drink
a
bottle
or
two
with

see

that
is
slightly
too
assertive
for
the
style
and
abv
theres
also
a
slight
viscosity
and
some
residual
alcohol
heat
at
the
finish
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
at
13
abv
possibly
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
definitely
a
beer
that
has
great
cellaring
potential
id
love
to
see
how
this
beer
rounds
out
with
perhaps
three
years
on
it
beer
is
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
think
ive
ever
had
im
not
the
biggest
barleywine
fan
out
there
but
this
is
an
incredible
beer
sweet
not
a
dry
finish
great
liquor
character
nice
body
creamy
smooth
you
can
hold
the
beer
in
your
mouth
for
a
long
time
without
any
alcohol
bite
or
any
heat
wonderful
truly
wonderful
i
hate
to
be
that
guy
but
abacus
is
even
better
from
the
tap
being
granted
a
cherry
sweetness
i
didnt
much
pick
up
in
the
bottle
incredible
overall
i
think
its
a
great
barleywine
that
deserves
a
try
very
complex
with
lots
of
layers
to
the
flavor
overall
this
is
pretty
dang
good
but
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
prickly
and
carbonated
very
chocolaty
i
must
say
its
excellent
but
i
am
not
blown
away
by
it
thick
and
chewy
with
a
bit
of
a
boozy
kick
to
it
overall
another
excellent
example
of
barrel
aged
beers
from
the
guys
and
gals
are
firestone
walker
incredible
barleywine
with
beautiful
dark
chocolate
cognac
pitted
fruit
and
unpitted
fruit
skins
tobacco
leather
subtle
bourbon
well
integrated
cardamom
clove
and
surprisingly
dryish
in
the
remarkably
lengthy
finish
impeccable
balance
from
sniff
to
aftertaste
simply
one
of
the
most
amazingly
sophisticated
barleywines
ive
ever
tasted
in
another
six
months
when
the
heat
has
subsided
this
will
be
a
true
masterpiece
edit
after
only
a
few
days
resting
the
heat
has
almost
totally
vanished
the
carbonation
is
softer
and
the
flavors
are
already
more
married
kudos
firestone
d
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easy
slightly
filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
for
a
highgravity
sipper
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
as
long
as
youre
able
to
handle
it
another
excellent
beer
from
a
really
impressive
brewery
4
5
overall
a
terrific
beer
and
a
stellar
example
of
a
barrelaged
barleywine
highly
recommended
ethereal
stuff
and
double
cheers
to
beer
rev
for
charging
their
usual
price
6
for
a
12oz
pour
m
d
sipper
cant
drink
a
lot
syrupy
and
chewy
creamy
aroma
is
very
complex
and
the
initial
smell
is
more
that
of
good
bourbon
than
beer
it
is
followed
by
a
leathery
tobacco
smell
that
fades
of
to
that
of
a
slight
bitterness
the
appearance
is
a
darker
amberred
color
with
a
khaki
head
the
taste
is
just
as
complex
as
the
aroma
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
bourbon
that
is
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
that
is
quickly
beaten
into
submission
by
the
malt
flavor
great
beer
with
not
too
much
bourbon
flavor
pour
is

off

this
was
my
experience
but
it
may
be
different
for
you
with
that
said
i
can
see
this
beer
being
a
bit
over
accessible
as
in
this
beer
is
so
broad
and
hides
the
abv
so
well
that
its
a
slow
approach
which
in
turn
makes
it
a
success
in
that
it
must
be
drank
slowly
carbonation
is
better
as
it
sits
o
an
incredible
beer
already
this
will
just
get
better
after
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
very
good
beer
pretty
complex
very
tasty
gets
better
as
it
warms
i
would
drink
this
again
and
again
though
probably
only
one
a
night
if
i
want
to
wake
up
the
next
day
it
is
truly
a
world
class
beer
one
of
the
few
5
0s
to
a
style
i
have
seen
judged
as
an
english
barleywine
i
cannot
find
a
flaw
o
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
liked
it
a
lot
in
the
bottle
loved
it
ontap
seek
this
out
o
great
ab
probably
top
5
in
my
book
its
good
to
see
a
ab
that
is
malt
heavy
and
the
barrel
aging
adds
to
the
sweet
side
22oz
bottle
from
beerdy
thanks
a
lot
man
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
good
little
head
at
first
smells
a
little
oaky
woody
boozy
shredded
coconut
good
taste
is
like
nice
chocolates
hardly
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
very
well
done
overall
this
is
probably
the
second
best
firestone
beer
ive
had
after
fw11
d
complex
interesting
and
intense
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
done
thing
of
this
strength
though
it
really
should
be
served
in
a
small
snifter
i
imagine
that
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
that
would
continue
to
improve
for
years
though
it
didnt
seem
to
need
any
age
when
i
had
it
o
this
is
a
good
barleywine
would
be
even
better
if
judged
as
an
english
style
but
it
is
a
bit
lacking
as
an
american
style
in
the
hop
category
definitely
a
barelywine
to
be
tried
by
all
loves
of
the
strong
style
overall
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
on
the
planet
for
sure
right
up
there
with
the
perfect
storm
09
and
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
09
competing
for
the
status
of
the
best
to
ever
cross
my
lips
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
great
for
the
style
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
so
definitely
try
if
you
have
the
chance
verdict
a
touch
below
stuff
like
xantus
but
still
top
tier
if
you
can
find
it
try
it
mf
a
nice
smooth
body
thats
about
moderate
to
just
about
full
drinkability
definitely
a
tasty
brewski
but
it
might
need
a
touch
more
time
at
this
point
its
slightly
too
sweet
and
i
dont
find
it
as
complex
or
delicious
as
ps
or
wh
maybe
thats
an
unfair
comparison
but
thats
what
its
up
against
in
my
mind
right
its
just
not
quite
there
yet
thanks
much
corey
edit
as
this
warms
the
booze
really
comes
out
of
this
the
nose
is
strong
with
alcohol
lowered
my
rating
of
the
smell
this
is
way
too
drinkable
and
dangerous
its
an
eager
sipper
mouthfeel
is
great
and
it
goes
down
smooth
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
cheers
an
exceptional
barely
wine
proud
to
have
this
be
my
first
review
o
great
barley
wine
but
for
me
it
needs
some
time
to
mellow
out
as
i
also
got
what
i
would
describe
as
a
spice
or
cinamon
note
in
there
which
was
a
bit
off
putting
to
me
no
one
elses
at
the
tasting
got
that
in
this
so
maybe
its
just
my
palate
but
it
was
subtle
so
hopefully
that
note
will
fade
out
and
the
other
notes
will
have
more
promience
i
have
three
bottles
in
the
cellar
so
will
what
some
age
does
to
it
d
i
thought
this
was
an
amazing
barleywine
lots
of
caramel
and
oak
mixing
with
some
sweet
vanill
and
bourbon
especially
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
great
and
this
was
scary
drinkable
for
13
cant
wait
to
get
bottles
of
this
one
when
it
comes
to
va
drinkability
is
ok
high
alcohol
level
and
the
whiskey
taste
make
this
on
a
little
problematic
in
the
drinkability
department
to
bad
this
isnt
in
7oz
bottles
overall
yeah
this
is
awesome
at
15
per
bottle
there
isnt
much
to
complain
about
here
i
wish
it
were
easier
to
find
but
that
isnt
the
beers
fault
world
class
stuff
cheers
overall
the
bourbon
aroma
coming
off
the
top
of
this
beer
is
outstanding
though
one
could
argue
that
the
aroma
is
rather
onedimensional
and
you
do
have
to
look
for
the
other
aroma
characteristics
but
thats
really
being
picky
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
balanced
the
alcohol
is
a
little
hot
but
this
will
tone
down
nicely
with
age
an
excellent
barleywine
overall
world
class
no
question
just
an
amazing
beer
well
worth
the
cost
imo
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
best
barlywines
ive
ever
had
incredibly
smooth
and
tasty
another
hit
from
fw
and
im
glad
i
have
plenty
of
bottles
m
very
thick
and
creamy
but
very
drinkable
at
the
same
time
especially
with
the
high
abv
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
this
was
quite
a
treat
after
having
it
on
tap
i
must
get
my
hands
on
a
couple
bottles
to
age
a
great
whisky
barrel
aged
barleywine
beer
is
dark
brown
with
no
head
heavy
warm
whisky
and
sweet
malt
notes
bought
a
bottle
to
age
the
beer
changed
a
lot
as
it
warmed
up
very
fruity
notes
as
it
warmed
versus
the
more
whisky
type
aroma
at
the
colder
temperature
an
excellent
beer
this
beer
is
absolutely
phenomenal
the
beer
pours
a
copperish
color
with
light
ruby
hues
and
a
decent
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
bourbon
and
malts
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
complex
the
bourbon
is
evident
up
front
followed
by
a
wonderfully
complex
malt
and
hop
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
full
a
little
fuller
than
i
was
expecting
bnut
not
a
bad
thing
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
ever
sampled
by
far
i
will
definitlely
be
stocking
up
on
some
bottles
for
aging
overall
an
extremely
well
blended
english
barleywine
and
an
exceptionally
well
crafted
barrel
aging
masterpiece
my
favorite
barleywine
great
both
on
draft
and
in
bottle
wow
cellaring
should
do
wonders
pours
cola
brown
with
thim
head
that
recedes
quickly
nose
is
impressive
with
a
hint
of
toasted
coconut
dark
rum
booziness
and
rum
cake
toasted
coconut
is
there
on
palate
too
with
some
raisin
jam
flavors
minerals
roasted
malty
flavors
and
rum
infused
dessert
flavors
at
the
end
a
bit
hot
too
i
really
do
enjoy
this
and
am
very
thankful
for
being
able
to
try
this
though
there
are
other
barrel
aged
firestone
walker
beers
that
i
prefer
still
very
much
worth
a
try
drink
this
was
big
flavorful
and
very
stout
like
i
have
a
couple
more
of
these
to
sit
on
and
i
am
very
glad
i
picked
the
extras
up
this
was
flavorful
and
powerful
and
i
think
it
can
only
get
better
with
age
overall
great
cross
between
old
ale
and
barleywine
very
soft
delicate
and
tasty
i
grabbed
this
bottle
at
yankee
spirits
in
stubridge
today
i
tried
this
last
weekend
at
ebf
and
was
impressed
so
lets
see
how
it
hold
up
from
the
bottle
it
pours
out
a
rosewood
color
with
half
a
finger
of
whitish
heading
the
color
is
nice
here
a
mix
of
red
and
brown
lots
of
caramel
and
alcohol
come
through
in
the
nose
along
with
just
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
more
of
the
same
from
the
taste
but
the
alcohol
is
much
more
in
the
forefront
than
in
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
creamy
and
chewy
all
at
the
same
time
the
abv
on
the
bottle
is
listed
as
13
as
opposed
to
the
12
i
see
above
in
any
event
the
alcohol
is
pretty
hot
on
this
one
right
now
i
am
thinking
this
beer
tastes
great
now
but
will
do
even
better
with
some
age
to
it
this
is
a
beer
to
buy
two
of
one
to
drink
now
and
one
to
cellar
for
a
while
o
this
is
a
really
good
barleywine
delicious
on
tap
overall
an
amazing
beer
glad
i
grabbed
a
few
to
age
get
some
for
sure
its
going
to
age
very
well
2011
vintage13abv
i
was
so
excited
to
try
this
one
considering
every
time
ive
gone
to
the
brewery
theyve
never
had
it
on
tap
pours
a
dark
amberreddish
color
with
almost
no
head
at
all
almost
like
some
cherry
cola
after
the
carbonation
has
settled
scent
is
oak
and
lots
of
it
the
oak
and
bourbon
flavors
are
absolutely
lovely
and
predominant
in
the
aroma
the
description
on
the
box
doesnt
specify
which
barrels
were
used
but
some
of
the
barrels
definitely
left
some
amazing
bourbon
notes
behind
taste
definitely
has
that
oak
flavor
as
well
along
with
delicious
cherry
and
vanilla
notes
there
are
also
hints
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
bourbon
is
blended
in
very
nicely
with
all
these
flavors
absolutely
phenomenal
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
smooth
with
such
amazing
complexity
drinkability
is
high
for
a
13
barleywine
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
will
only
get
better
and
better
with
age
one
customer
remarked
that
he
thought
this
could
be
kept
for
5
years
and
i
cant
disagree
this
is
going
to
be
a
beast
and
im
glad
that
i
caught
a
taste
of
it
before
it
goes
back
into
hiding
abacus
was
a
successfully
blended
barrelaged
brew
the
taste
was
excellent
but
i
found
a
lack
of
uniqueness
among
these
barrelaged
beers
nevertheless
i
enjoyed
sipping
abacus
because
it
gave
me
the
enjoyment
of
tasting
a
recherche
and
tasty
beverage
d
high
abv
will
limit
drinkability
of
this
dlove
it
overall
i
am
excited
to
get
some
bottles
of
this
and
enjoy
over
time
nice
work
on
this
one
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
d
for
being
13
this
is
a
masterpiece
i
think
this
and
parabola
are
great
examples
from
firestone
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
the
vanillin
and
coconut
notes
are
nice
in
this
beer
and
it
is
well
accentuated
by
the
malt
sweetness
but
this
is
too
hot
and
too
bourbon
dominated
in
the
end
if
you
really
like
bourbon
then
i
can
see
this
being
quite
the
enjoyable
tipple
but
it
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
for
me
ontap
at
city
beer
store
good
barleywine
aromas
creamy
mouthfeel
a
tad
of
creamy
offwhite
head
on
brown
carbonation
was
a
tad
fizzy
decent
drinkability
i
could
have
much
more
in
a
meal
a
decent
barleywinebritish
in
character
though
not
exceptional
on
this
day

i
dont
know
if
the
beer
changed
or
my
palate
but
this
beer
has
been
a
lot
boozier
when
ive
tried
it
since
my
review
its
still
quite
good
just
a
bit
much
a
small
taste
is
all
i
really
want
at
once
d
insane
so
easy
to
drink
very
lucky
to
have
tried
it
i
would
go
after
this
one
like
crazy
to
have
another
glass
amber
colored
beverage
with
some
burgundy
highlights
and
almost
no
head
to
be
found
the
aroma
consists
of
molasses
maple
syrup
candy
and
light
malt
the
taste
is
boozy
with
the
alcohol
on
the
forefront
and
a
medicinelike
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
a
port
wine
slight
burn
on
the
swallow
and
a
tummy
warming
sensation
as
well
it
has
a
numbing
effect
on
the
teeth
and
tongue
as
mr
furley
would
say
smoooth
a
definite
sipper
beer
that
would
go
well
as
an
after
dinner
drink
or
with
a
nice
cigar
nice
work
on
this
creation
if
anyone
gets
the
chance
to
taste
this
beer
i
hope
you
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
black
opaque
but
when
held
up
to
the
light
some
deep
browns
and
rubies
are
noticeable
aromas
are
huge
fig
currant
vanilla
and
some
unmistakable
vinous
qualities
lots
of
anise
too
flavors
are
similar
with
the
anise
and
vanilla
really
dominating
a
bit
of
dark
rum
and
sugar
in
there
as
well
plenty
of
heat
on
this
very
strong
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
and
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
mellow
id
want
to
lay
this
batch
down
for
about
a
year
and
see
what
happens
to
the
dark
fruit
flavors
i
couldnt
drink
very
much
of
this
at
once
but
i
can
see
myself
sipping
on
a
small
snifter
of
this
beer
after
dinner
heavy
flavors
and
abv
but
so
luscious
nearly
impossible
to
put
down
the
glass
had
this
on
tap
at
gabf
09
and
finally
getting
around
to
entering
it
here
pours
a
very
dark
brown
mocha
color
with
just
a
hint
of
stone
colored
head
a
very
aggressive
nose
with
bourbon
oak
and
dark
fruit
raisins
plums
taking
the
first
sip
creates
an
explosion
of
incredible
flavorsloads
of
bourbon
dark
malts
oak
vanilla
dark
fruit
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
alcohol
is
definitely
present
and
noticeable
but
adds
to
rather
than
distracts
from
the
pleasure
i
get
from
drinking
this
one
an
absolutely
perfect
example
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
this
beer
does
not
resemble
a
barleywine
in
my
opinion
but
what
a
treat
anyways
thanks
to
the
guys
at
spuyten
duyvil
this
is
a
barleywine
i
feel
like
ive
been
missing
a
lot
with
the
others
ive
drunk
but
everything
works
here
much
more
drinkable
d
normally
you
dont
associate
barleywines
with
easy
drinking
but
this
one
is
so
smooth
and
delicious
that
its
easy
to
keep
going
back
for
more
i
cant
wait
until
this
is
bottled
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
barleywines
mainly
due
to
the
overly
sweet
and
sticky
properties
so
many
of
them
seem
to
have
this
abacus
however
was
nothing
like
that
at
all
easily
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
if
you
happen
to
see
it
anywhere
its
definitely
worth
a
try
d
great
overall
not
that
i
would
want
to
session
it
but
ya
know
this
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
exceeded
my
expectations
very
nuanced
and
drinkable
big
barleywine
i
look
forward
to
firestone
bottling
this
later
this
year
palate
creamy
with
low
carbonation
slight
booze
but
not
much
for
12
abv
drinkability
is
not
awesome
but
its
pretty
high
for
what
the
beer
is
cellared
keg
from
2008
enjoyed
on
draught
at
beachwood
bbq
pours
exceptionally
dark
in
color
which
could
easily
confuse
it
for
an
imperial
stout
compact
and
dense
dark
tan
head
is
under
a
centimeter
tall
aromas
of
toffee
brandy
and
spicy
hops
come
through
tastes
of
toffee
raw
sugar
brandy
leather
and
maple
finish
is
increasingly
spicy
with
a
floral
almost
phenolic
finish
heavy
in
body
chewy
and
smooth
yet
with
prickly
medium
carbonation
that
makes
for
a
perfect
barleywine
feel
one
of
the
best
barrel
aged
barleywines
on
the
planet
exceptional
flavor
that
can
be
savored
for
extended
periods
of
time
wow
didnt
think
the
taste
would
be
better
than
the
aroma
but
it
was
bold
toast
flavor
chocolate
raisins
toffee
almonds
flaked
toasted
coconut
in
the
finish
with
vanilla
and
oak
notes
of
bakers
chocolate
this
beer
was
delicious
a
low
carbonation
helped
to
bring
a
creaminess
to
the
beer
making
it
run
down
smoothly
down
the
tongue
i
could
have
easily
had
another
one
of
these
if
we
didnt
have
to
leave
so
early
will
have
to
try
harder
to
make
it
to
any
bar
that
has
this
one
next
time
d
mouthfeel
draws
you
back
for
more
more
easily
than
it
should
be
to
drink
this
rich
viscous
liquid
so
points
for
that
but
overall
not
very
drinkable
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
had
at
this
event
that
has
simply
floored
me
with
its
silky
rich
yummy
goodness
pours
deep
amber
to
near
dark
brown
and
micro
thin
tan
head
wow
another
knee
buckler
aroma
with
a
smooth
blended
mixture
of
wood
molasses
rich
dark
fruity
esters
and
more
rich
molasses
the
wood
notes
become
mildly
brighter
upon
further
inspection
the
taste
is
just
amazing
with
some
smooth
bourbon
flowing
into
deep
rich
dark
fruity
esters
accented
with
well
rounded
smooth
wood
notes
just
a
smooth
beer
that
gets
almost
velvety
for
a
while
it
dries
out
a
tad
into
the
finish
off
the
tap
at
555
haight
had
this
ontap
at
toronado
in
san
francisco
during
their
anniversary
celebration
this
august
served
in
a
small
port
wine
glass
poured
black
with
little
head
very
dark
stoutlike
color
smells
sweet
rich
and
fruity
with
prunes
brown
sugar
dates
slightly
roasty
and
almost
tar
like
on
the
finish
more
tar
flavors
in
the
taste
some
roastiness
quite
bitter
almost
quinine
like
followed
by
vinous
qualities
that
are
fruity
and
strong
almost
reminiscent
of
port
wine
on
the
finish
there
is
a
hit
of
unsweetened
black
licorice
strong
and
thick
in
the
mouth
this
beer
bears
more
than
a
passing
resemblance
to
an
imperial
stout
but
with
some
rich
sweet
notes
of
an
american
strong
as
well
i
wouldnt
really
call
this
a
barley
wine
but
whatever
it
is
its
mighty
tasty
d
its
a
slow
sipper
and
at
12
it
can
quickly
wear
down
my
sobriety
just
as
fast
as
the
intense
flavor
wears
down
my
palate
just
a
touch
less
drinkable
than
the
awesome
10
as
this
batch
seemed
a
little
younger
and
hotter
overall
exceptional
i
tried
this
toronado
22nd
party
mostly
because
i
saw
it
won
the
toronado
bw
fest
earlier
this
year
definitely
solid
and
12abv
not
noticeable
very
dangerous
similar
to
older
viscosity
or
bourbon
as
technically
a
bw
but
could
almost
pass
as
an
old
ale
strong
ale
or
even
stout
about
a
10
ounce
pour
in
a
plastic
cup
at
darklord
day
2009
body
is
a
blackish
brown
mocha
tone
that
hosts
only
a
rim
of
skim
tan
head
nose
is
brilliant
with
tones
of
bourbon
and
candied
dark
fruit
based
malts
there
is
a
soft
rustic
hint
of
a
hop
profile
there
also
loads
of
bourbon
initially
flood
the
tongue
this
is
quickly
followed
by
a
very
sweet
malt
character
with
tones
of
dark
fruit
like
raisins
and
plums
all
the
time
keeping
a
well
balanced
background
hop
character
that
adds
nice
zing
and
balance
lots
of
vanilla
and
even
some
cordial
chocolate
show
up
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
desert
like
very
nice
super
smooth
and
attractively
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
firestone
walker
please
bottle
this
one
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
as
a
matter
of
fact
im
on
my
6th
glass
and
not
looking
back
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
in
the
taste
very
dangerous
elixir
bottle
this
already
this
is
one
excellent
barleywine
very
bourbonoriented
and
has
all
elements
you
would
expect
from
it
firestone
rocks
d
quite
drinkable
as
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
not
too
much
big
thick
monstrous
barley
wine
with
decent
hopping
on
the
finish
hints
of
rs
with
a
boubony
middle
and
vanilla
toasty
oak
induced
middlefinish
dried
fruits
and
a
hint
of
currant
caramel
and
date
with
mollasses
and
chocolate
delicious
overall
wow
and
this
is
the
stuff
that
comprised
at
least
i
believe
40
or
so
of
firestone
10
a
really
beautiful
beer
and
a
top
five
barleywine
for
me
as
well
seek
this
beer
out
and
enjoy
cheers
mouthfeel
is
lighter
for
a
barrel
aged
brew
like
this
but
i
think
it
adds
to
the
experience
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
not
too
syrupy
leads
to
an
amazing
drinkability
factor
i
highly
recommend
making
an
effort
to
try
this
one
d
another
outstanding
barrel
aged
product
from
firestone
theyve
certainly
found
a
niche
they
excel
at
fantastic
and
a
must
have
good
feel
and
the
drinkability
is
extravagant
given
the
potency
as
the
alcohol
is
present
on
the
nose
but
not
on
the

firestone

now
if

my

on

firestones

is
showing
why
it
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
their
three
blends
thus
far
have
been
fantastic
and
same
with
every
beer
that
makes
those
up
i
just
went
out
to
grab
a
beer
after
a
rough
day
at
work
and
stumbled
upon
this
masterpiece
wish
i
knew
it
about
it
before
because
i
would
have
been
there
when
they
opened
and
had
several
more
of
these
this
beer
is
going
to
create
some
serious
hype
as
it
circulates
through
the
state
i
cannot
wait
to
have
more

not

one
of
the

at

this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
barleywines
that
i
have
had
and
look

availability
firestone
although
seemingly
focused

either

i
was
blown
away
when
i
tried
this
i
heard
it
placed
second
in
the
sf
barleywine
festival
and
it
deserves
it
firestone
is
making
some
fantastic
special
releases
on
tap
at
city
beer
store
joey
schlitz
had
the
last
glass
in
the
keg
awesome
barleywine
one
of
the
best
ive
had
sweet
carmel
toffee
and
malt
flavors
not
a
ton
of
hops
the
flavor
is
not
the
least
bit
abrasive
one
could
accidentally
drink
enough
of
these
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
call
in
sick
to
work
the
next
day
why
doesnt
firestone
bottle
this
a
different
type
of
barleywine
than
the
sugary
high
alcohol
set
although
this
one
aint
no
session
beer
just
an
awesome
beer
would
drink
it
every
night
if
i
could
d
as
drinakble
at
a
11
abv
barleywine
could
be
definitely
a
nice
sipping
beer
great
way
to
finish
off
a

some

and
a

aroma
with
plenty
of
alcohol
dark
alcoholic
fruit
and
a
little
dark
chocolate
pretty
low
carbonation
and
an
oily
slick
body
the
alcohol
component
is
pretty
strong
and
the
roasted
chocolate
flavor
almost
suggests
an
irish
coffee
but
this
is
far
better
pretty
dark
barley
wine
but
interesting
a
good
sipper
mouthfeel
is
too
low
on
carbonation
but
the
viscosity
is
spoton
for
a
big
bad
barleywine
and
the
finish
is
shockingly
dry
on
the
tongue
a
superb
barleywine
that
exhibits
a
wonderful
spirit
barrel
character
from
my
understanding
this
was
a
blend
from
several

at

of
this

which
is
also
fantastic
i
highly
recommend
cellaring
this

the

so
amazing
that
its
easy
to
forgive
its
lack
of

the
2014

overall
a
knockout
could
have
been
overly

it
dries
right

just
the

this

exquisitely
with
almost
the
perfect
amount

flavor
and
smell

by
a
solid
malt
backbone
highly
recommended
seeking
this
beer
out
twice
as
good
as
the
dba

definitely
a
world
class
beer
the
bourbon

is
subtle

the
flavors

blend
perfectly

the

perfectly

all
the

love

sucaba

i
think
this
has
a
rougher
profile
than
sucaba

a

semi

and
getting
lots

on
the

heavy

with

this
starts
with
a
smooth
light
sweetness
maple
toffee

and
a
honey
dipped
candy
flavor
it
ends
with
stronger
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
fw
does
nothing
but
impress
and
this
is
right
along
with
their
best
pours
a
touch
hazy
reddish
amber
color
with
a
decent
sized
tightly
bubbled
tan
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
aromas
of
caramel
brown
and
caramelized
sugar
with
lots
of
juicy
pitted
fruit
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
woodiness
the
flavor
is
sweet
sugary
malt
with
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
and
a
somewhat
overly
present
alcohol
heat
hints
of
pitted
fruits
and
a
light
smoked
toffee
round
the
flavor
out
thick
body
light
carbonation
sticky
syrupy
with
an

very
flavorful
but
shows
all
of
the12
abv
could
use
a
bit
of
time
to
mellow
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
another
given
half
a
chance
not
as
popular
as
some
of
the
other
ba
beers
from
fw
but
one
of
my
favorites
love
the
ba
barleywine
2014
this
has
aged
super
well
o
outstanding
english
style
barley
wine
sad
to
see
this
one
go
but
at
least
i
have
a
2014
bottle
yet
to
enjoy
firestone
usually
kills
it
on
any
of
their
special
releases
no
exception
here
so
smooth
the
bodys
like
liquid
silk
caramel
and
toffee
just
an
outstanding
barleywine
and
not
that
far
behind
sucuba
excellent
very
boozy
yet
balanced
world
class
brew
going
into
this
knowing
that
we
dont
particularly
love
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
i
was
stunned
this
was
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
as
each
sip
becomes
more
and
more
complex
with
the
temperature
of
our
glasses
rising
beautiful
color
nose
taste
and
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
one
i
expected
to
be
indifferent
to
but
came
out
absolutely
loving
shouldve
bought
more
o
english
barleywines
and
old
ales
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
when
the
are
barrel
aged
i
usually
find
them
to
be
amazing
and
that
is
the
case
with
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
how
smooth
it
was
and
it
really
had
the
same
huge
toasted
coconut
and
marshmallow
that
i
get
from
two
of
my
favorites
kuhnhenn
bb4d
and
bcbbw
i
hope
to
trade
for
more
of
this
in
the
future
this
is
a
delicious
beer
well
worth
cracking
for
a
special
occasion
or
a
long
slow
evening
d
double
dba
is
another
great
barrel
aged
offering
in
the
firestonewalker
lineup
while
the
final
blend
doesnt
scream
bourbon
to
me
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
that
coconut
i
think
that
balance
is
the
real
testament
to
the
brew
masters
as
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
this
doesnt
pummel
you
over
the
head
with
the
spirits
like
a
truncheon
yielding
bobby
a
bit
sweeter
than
others
so
best
to
take
some
time
with
this
one
or
share
with
friends
shame
they
are
discontinuing
bottles
overall
fantastic
offering
by
fw
and
a
new
nomenclature
for
me
imperial
special
bitter
call
it
what
you
want
ill
call
it
malty
magnificence
its
smooth
as
good
bourbon
with
a
steady
carbonation
to
it
it
comes
on
creamy
and
eases
dry
without
losing
the
smoothness
while
just
a
bit
of
crispness
gently
nips
it
never
loses
smoothness
and
the
heat
just
sort
of
slides
in
and
into
the
finish
overall
great
brew
and
highly
recommended
fw
is
my
favorite
when
it
comes
to
barrel
aging
and
this
one
is
superb
i
have
another
bottle
that
im
going
to
age
for
at
least
6
months
to
make
a
comparison
understand
its
going
away
but
hopefully
will
return
someday
overall
its
a
decent
aged
brew
but
seems
to
also
hint
at
lighter
strong
and
old
ale
qualities
which
for
the
heavy
hitting
oomph
dorks
out
there
probably
doesnt
get
to
many
people
excited
great
beer
to
try
and
decent
for
what
it
is
big
vanilla
nose
slightly
sweet
vanillabarrel
taste
not
hot
at
all
well
balanced
for
a
12abv
beer
think
6
months
will
put
this
beer
in
a
good
spot
firestone
is
truly
a
master
of
barrel
aging

a
22

moderately
strong

and
a
dry

that
brings
a

and
a
lingering
spice
to
it
overall
impressive
but
i
think
i
had
unrealistically
high
hopes
probably
a
palate
issue
because
the
single
double
barrel
ale
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
firestone
beers
and
at
its
core
this
has
the
flavoring
of
dba
a
nice
english
barley
wine
though
especially
if
you
like
an
after
dinner
sweet
sipper
its
a
shame
that
this
will
be
the
last
time
this
is
bottled
jd
this
one
packs
quite
a
punch
which
i
normally
dont
mind
in
something
like
a
stout
but
this
one
tastes
more
like
a
liquor
than
beer
the
taste
is
pretty
close
to
that
of
a
cognac
this
is
certainly
more
of
a
sipping
beer
than
one
watching
a
ballgame
i
really
wish
i
had
a
nice
cigar
to
go
along
with
this
one
very
tasty
but
rating
it
as
a
beer
im
a
bit
torn
its
nice
but
is
there
really
much
beer
character
left
here
overall
this
is
nice
stuff
as
part
of
the
big
intense
blended
anniversary
ales
its
clearly
a
integral
part
but
on
its
own
its
a
little
bit
of
an
oddity
a
wonderful
showcase
of
the
bourbon
barrel
here
different
than
all
the
stouts
and
thick
sticky
blends
they
do
this
is
a
lighter
in
color
and
in
roastiness
malt
bill
than
a
lot
of
their
big
barreled
beers
i
think
it
lets
the
wood
and
the
bourbon
flavors
really
present
themselves
well
english
sort
of
grain
profile
to
this
sweet
and
sappy
caramel
like
and
full
bodied
the
beer
looks
about
right
for
what
it
claims
to
be
toffee
colored
beer
with
bronzed
amber
edges
not
much
head
from
the
tap
or
at
least
it
settles
down
pretty
quickly
tons
and
tons
of
sweet
vanilla
on
the
nose
this
has
very
obviously
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
resting
on
bourbon
a
sturdy
char
on
the
barrel
too
helps
to
add
depth
and
mellow
what
i
cant
believe
isnt
hot
alcohol
its
so
well
hidden
here
there
is
even
some
hops
in
the
finish
of
this
one
more
than
just
the
requisite
english
bittering
hops
i
get
a
dried
straw
and
corn
husk
character
from
them
in
addition
to
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
some
of
the
left
over
sugars
in
the
finish
of
this
complex
and
woody
this
is
a
great
example
of
firestone
walkers
ability
to
barrel
age
beers
tons
of
the
whiskey
character
comes
through
and
i
like
the
coppery
sweet
caramel
malt
a
real
treat
to
drink
it
warms
up
well
and
i
think
its
different
than
what
we
usually
expect
from
barleywine
d
i
only
bought
one
due
to
the
price
tag
but
wish
i
had
cleared
the
shelf
of
the
three
of
four
boxes
they
had
this
beer
does
not
need
any
more
age
which
is
good
because
i
am
not
sure
i
could
resist
i
have
been
trying
to
convert
my
port
wine
drinking
dad
to
beers
for
years
and
this
may
be
just
the
one
to
do
it
overall
a
wonderful
ale
that
i
know
will
be
even
better
with
age
i
hope
to
track
down
another
bottle
soon
cheers
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
a
reminder
of
any
of
the
anniversary
ales
that
i
have
enjoyed
it
wasnt
as
sweet
and
flavorful
as
sucaba
but
for
a
barley
wine
it
would
hold
its
own
against
any
others
out
there
this
beer
knows
how
to
treat
you
right
final
word
buy
it
on
the
spot
no
questions
asked
firestone
walker
beers
are
rarely
available
outside
of
the
west
coast
much
less
a
reserve
series
like
the
double
dba
so
you
may
only
ever
get
one
chance
to
taste
it
barring
a
move
to
california
though
itd
probably
be
worth
the
move
all
of
the
flavors
in
this
beer
work
in
perfect
harmony
to
create
a
drink
that
sips
like
a
liquid
dessert
but
without
being
too
sweet
or
overbearing
drink
it
when
the
air
outside
is
chilly
and
let
the
warm
roasted
flavors
wrap
you
up
like
a
blanket
overall
decent
barrel
and
pretty
tasty
but
monotonous
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
still
prefer
ucaba
as
my
favorite
fw
barleywine
d
great
barleywine
excellent
sipper
that
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
taste
there
is
a
nuttiness
at
first
that
changes
into
a
sweet
vanilla
taste
and
ends
with
something
somewhat
smokey
overall
a
nice
bba
barleywine
too
carbonated
but
overall
nicely
balanced
overall
mighty
fine
brew
havent
had
this
fresh
but
im
guessing
the
age
did
it
well
in
mellowing
out
the
alcohol
presence
and
letting
some
of
the
other
flavors
come
to
the
fore
not
sure
where
id
rank
this
against
fws
other
widelyavailable
proprietors
vintage
beers
but
not
sure
id
careits
delicious
o
a
very
well
done
barleywine
firestone
really
knows
how
to
barrelage
beers
and
alongside
sucaba
and
parabola
this
holds
up
very
well
not
as
deliciously
sweet
as
sucaba
but
this
is
still
an
outstanding
beer
o
a
great
beer
that
transforms
from
a
barleywine
to
a
bitter
in
your
mouth

in

tasting

out

we

overall

from
all
the

overall
if
youve
had
founders
backwoods
bastard
and
sweet
repute
this
is
almost
like
a
hybrid
between
those
two
flavors
insanely
good
overall
an
excellent
beer
worth
cellaring
oa
good
beer
nothing

improved
it
some
o
this
is
a
bloody
treat
with
this
sucaba

and
to
a
lesser
extent
velvet
merkin
im
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
fw
is
incapable
of
a
subpar
barrelaged
beer
this
is
the
last
vintage
for
this
one
so
buy
some
if
you
can
find
it
i
will
give
updates
on
this
and
the
2013
vintage
in
the
coming
years
truly
another
world
class
brew
i
will
have
to
try
this
side
by
side
with
sucaba
to
determine
which
is
my
favorie
barely

plenty

well
looks

the
nose
is
balanced
and
does
not
betray
excessive
alcohol
presence
a
good
underlying
roastiness
stiffens
its
nostril
presence
so
its
not
overly
sugary
still
no

of
molasses
caramelized
brown

butterscotch
at
the

time
you
get
green
apple

could
be

mildly
on

rock

and
adds
to

overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
light
years
better
than
the
base
beer
from
which
it
is
made
while
im
not
really
a
fan
of
double
barrel
ale
at
all
this
one
is
fantastic
id
like
to
get
my
hands
on
a
second
bottle
and
sit
on
it
for
awhile
to
see
how
it
develops
with
time
but
at
six
months
its
drinking
just
fantastic
its
sucabas
less
talkedabout
but
nonetheless
impressive
sibling
o
really
good
but
id
take
most
of
the
other
barrel
aged
fw
beers
over
this
if
not
all
othis
is
a
tasty
beer
and
it
made
for
a
nice
accompaniment
to
my
boxing
day
meal
of
christmas
leftovers
compared
against
the
best
barleywines
this
brew
might
be
a
little
simple
but
if
i
come
across
another
bottle
i
would
consider
aging
for
a
bit
to
see
if
the
booze
and
sweetness
mellow
and
develop
more
complexity
easy
to
find
and
a
very
solid
offering
from
fw
while
it
wont
carry
quite
the
allure
of
others
from
the
program
ddba
isnt
one
worth
passing
over
overall
this
is
tasty
but
it
needs
a
bit
more
bitterness
to
round
it
out
i
mightve
sat
on
it
too
long
overall
really
good
cant
wait
to
see
this
develop
over
the
years
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
much
much
better
than
just
dba
the
bourbon
and
oak
here
are
superb
tastes
great
with
age
on
it
cheers
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
wish
i
hadnt
shared
big
thanks
to
dave
for
breaking
this
one
out
pours
a

with
no

consistent
with
nose
buttery
and
malty
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
an
easy
carbonation
and
a
slight

overall
im
very
impressed
with
this
brew
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
but
i
found
this
quite
enjoyable
not
something
i
would
recommend
for
extended
cellaring
however
an
excellent
sipper
smooth
easy
drinking
gets
even
better
as
it
warms
although
the
barrel
smells
and
tastes
are
fairly
forward
they
dont
overwhelm
to
make
it
too
boozy
for
a
12
percenter
this
goes
down
so
smoothly
and
easy
tons
of
complex
caramel
and
sugary
tastes
beautifully
crafted
just
a
delight
to
drink
cant
wait
to
consume
my
bottle
being
aged
as
we
speak
yum
ps
ill
be
hoarding
this
guy
all
next
year
also
i
was
super
impressed
with
this
firestone
walker
offering
this
is
what
an
english
barleywine
should
taste
like
sweet
and
balanced
without
being
an
alcoholbomb
or
cloyingly
hopped
very
nice
and
probably
my
new
favorite
of
the
style
o
a
great
beer
overall
lots
of
great
bourbon
notes
cheers
one
tasty
complex
and
strong
version
of
the
style
among
the
last
that
id
suspect
to
come
out
of
this
brewing
region
what
with
their
predilection
for
west
coast
hoppimpin
robust
thick
and
rather
enjoyable
the
bigass
abv
well
ingrained
and
generally
obfuscated
a
nice
warmup
for
a
night
on
the
local
arts
and
lit
scene
with
international
sex
pundit
dan
savage
methinks
overall
a
big
and
sweet
brew
with
a
nice
warming
and
smooth
feel
a
nice
slow
sipper
this
beer
really
drinks
very
easily
the
alcohol
is
not
there
for
a
12
beer
it
has
a
lighter
sweetness
than
that
dark
rich
toffee
sweet
barleywine
it
does
a
wonderful
job
for
those
who
find
those
beers
too
big
and
would
like
to
try
something
that
turns
things
a
bit
down
into
more
subtle
complexity
pours
a
deep
rich
amber
with
a
nicely
formed
one
and
a
half

dominate
the
nosesome
toasted
oak
is
there
as
wellsmells
like
a
booze
bomb
sweetness
is
the
main
flavor
component
of
this
beersweet
dark
fruit
and
bourbon

mixed

more

jet

booze
wow
a
little
to
much
boozy
sweetness
for
mei
wanna
stay
awake
to
see
the
tigers
beat
the
ugly
beards
total
4650
o
a
very
complex
and
layered
beer
the
oak
really
shines
along
with
the
massive
amounts
of
malt
doesnt
really
feel
like
12
until
it
hits
you
over
the
head
a
great
ba
brew
thats
worth
the
15
price
tag
double
a
double
can
be
good
or
it
can
be
bad
in
the
case
of
this
brew
its
quite
good
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
small
cream
head
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
malty
wood
and
yes
sweet
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
sweet
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
there
is
no
alcohol
after
taste
full
of
carmel
toffee
and
oak
this
one
goes
down
very
easy
and
at
12
percent
this
could
be
a
bad
thing
a
wonderful
after
dinner
sipping
brew
firestone
is
getting
very
good
with
the
oak
barrels
in
there
brewing
midfull
on
the
palate
the
beer
plays
out
with
little
carbonation
in
order
to
finish
with
some
semblance
of
dryness
its
a
succulent
and
savory
ale
that
retains
much
of
its
creamy
sweetness
to
extend
well
into
the
beers
next
sip
finishing
semidry
the
ale
offers
a
good
degree
of
drinkability
but
is
a
tough
out
for
anyone
under
a
party
of
four
nice
showcase
of
barrel
aging
and
malt
character
p
balaclava
or
honeyed
greek
yogurt
with
pistachios
mouthfeel
is
standard
from
what
id
expect
from
this
but
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
i
really
like
this
and
i
love
the
smell
this
is
a
great
offering
from
firestone
and
i
think
i
need
to
find
that
sucaba
ive
been
reading
about
overall
hides
the
abv
so
damn
well
this
is
a
real
treat
would
drink
again
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
this
years
vintage
to
test
drive
o
glad
i
bought
a
second
expert
use
of
the
barrel
and
the
bourbon
flavor
really
sets
the
dba
off
an
achievement
overall
this
was
everything
that
i
expected
this
was
also
very
well
crafted
nicely
balanced
and
the
base
beer
was
just
spot
on
to
the
style
of
an
english
barleywine
this
is
an
exceptional
example
of
its
style
and
if
you
are
a
fan
of
american
and
englishstyle
barleywines
dont
miss
out
on
this
limited
release
overall
my
first
brew
from
firestone
walker
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
an
excellent
barleywine
and
one
of
the
best
american
brews
ive
had
definitely
recommended
although
at
18
or
so
a
bottle
not
something
a
could
afford
too
often
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
such
a
complex
aroma
and
taste
to
this
one
its
a
shining
example
of
barrel
aging
quality
this
is
one
to
sip
savor
and
experience
it
can
run
a
bit
expensive
14
99
per
bomber
in
this
area
but
its
definitely
worth
the
price
tag
pick
this
one
up
while
its
available
as
someone
whos
had
my
fair
share
of
barrelfocused
beers
barleywines
and
spirits
its
hard
not
to
go
nuts
over
a
beer
like
this
its
superbly
made
and
blended
and
you
can
tell
a
lot
of
care
was
put
into
the
blending
and
choosing
of
the
barrels
as
well
as
the
flavor
profile
that
makes
this
beer
up
this
is
hard
and
costly
stuff
to
make
and
its
nothing
short
than
impressive
that
fw
has
managed
to
make
a
beer
like
this
affordable
and
accessible
to
all
in
their
distro
this
vintage
is
drinking
great
its
going
to
be
tempting
not
to
open
my
2013
bottle
o
4
75
i
guess
i
should
have
expected
this
to
be
amazing
for
a
twenty
dollar
beer
but
god
damn
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
anything
else
ive
ever
had
i
havent
really
gotten
into
aging
beers
yet
but
my
guess
is
that
aging
this
one
would
only
make
it
better
ive
always
been
one
to
avoid
spending
over
610
dollars
on
a
bomber
or
six
pack
but
this
completely
changed
my
attitude
absolutely
amazing
the
only
thing
i
could
ask
is
a
little
bit
more
head
but
hey
at
12
what
are
they
supposed
to
do
overall
4
55
double
dba
is
an
excellent
example
of
why
firestone
walker
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
country
im
blown
away
by
the
barrel
character
on
this
beer
here
is
a
rich
beer
worthy
of
the
most
special
occasion
excellent
stuff
that
really
is
worth
the
18
99
price
tag
the
taste
is
fantastic
with
a
winelike
quality
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
overall
a
great
beer
balanced
very
well
and
no
one
flavor
is
dominant
the
flavors
also
change
nicely
throughout
overall
i
can
definitely
see
why
this
is
classified
on
here
as
a
barleywine
which
is
apparently
what
esbs
turn
into
when
they
evolve
the
barrel
aging
has
sapped
any
bitterness
this
beer
once
had
turning
into
a
dark
sweet
sipping
pleasure
as
usual
firestone
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
beer
they
took
their
flagship
beer
dbadouble
barrel
ale
doubled
the
recipe
and
aged
in
a
mix
of
neutral
oak
and
mixed
spirit
barrels
what
comes
out
of
these
barrels
is
a
bit
of
an
anomaly
im
not
sure
how
firestone
managed
to
take
a
12
5
imperial
special
bitter
and
still
have
it
drink
like
a
heavy
esb
with
out
it
even
verging
into
english
barleywine
territory
this
beer
isnt
their
most
complex
barrel
aged
beer
but
it
certainly
drinks
the
easiest
the
low
profile
malts
really
allow
the
barrels
to
shine
i
cant
say
ive
had
something
quite
like
this
bravo
firestone
overall
a
really
good
barleywine
i
would
recommend
in
a
heartbeat
barrel
qualities
really
shine
a
must
have
for
any
fan
of
barley
wines
or
oak
aging
this
is
a
great
bottle
o
an
absolute
knock
out
so
well
balanced
appropriately
rich
and
obviously
blended
with
care
and
intelligence
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
but
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
age
does
to
it
o
really
sweet
a
tasty
beer
a
little
less
bitter
than
id
prefer
being
an
imperial
special
bitter
really
not
carbonated
enough
id
like
to
put
it
down
for
a
year
and
see
how
it
matures
it
has
been
some
time
since
i
have
written
a
full
review
the
beer
i
am
drinking
now
has
inspired
me
to
return
to
the
art
of
the
beer
review
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
when
it
was
released
eh
few
times
has
aging
a
beer
resulted
in
such
beneficial
returns
the
appearance
is
a
lovely
garnet
color
and
rather
clear
some
lacing
is
left
by
the
rather
light
tan
head
aroma
is
interesting
the
barrel
has
faded
almost
completely
and
what
is
left
is
a
port
like
quality
kind
of
fig
like
dried
fruit
thing
the
flavor
pops
smooth
there
is
still
barrel
in
the
flavor
fruity
caramel
toffee
all
of
the
great
flavors
you
would
expect
from
an
english
strong
ale
oh
wait
this
is
an
american
strong
ale
who
listed
it
as
such
the
surprise
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
soft
balanced
and
meshes
with
itself
not
cloying
not
sweet
really
great
this
beer
is
full
on
the
palate
it
does
not
burn
it
is
not
cloying
remember
this
ale
is
around
a
year
old
now
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
can
see
why
firestone
uses
it
for
their
anniversary
beers
the
alcohol
flavor
would
fade
with
proper
aging
and
there
is
a
good
amount
of
flavor
smoothness
and
depth
of
character
to
the
beer
itself
overall
a
fantastic
brew
amazing
drinkability
not
too
heavy
or
overpowering
that
youd
get
burnt
out
on
it
i
love
it
yum
yum
all
the
way
around
probably
the
least
of
the
proprietors
reserve
series
ive
tried
by
fw
and
this
is
evinced
by
the
fact
it
sits
on
the
shelves
much
longer
than
parabola
sucaba
the
anniversary
ales
and
velvet
merkin
that
being
said
its
still
a
worthy
candidate
for
a
nice
warming
winter
drink
with
friends
be
careful
itll
sneak
up
on
you
quick
o
a
complex
highly
drinkable
barleywinestrong
ale
this
was
bottled
365
days
ago
so
i
imagine
some
heat
has
come
off
this
guy
now
very
tasty
and
worth
a
try
for
you
barrelaged
fiends
go
grab
one
if
you
can
cheers
o
i
did
not
expect
the
beer
to
feel
this
massive
the
booze
is
incredibly
noticeable
like
a
barrel
aged
old
ale
with
a
huge
fruit
presence
but
not
as
heavy
i
wasnt
totally
sold
initially
but
i
really
warmed
up
to
it
its
very
unique
against
the
masses
of
ba
barley
wines
out
on
the
market
ba
imperial
bitter
go
figure
this
will
not
be
a
full
depth
review
smells
thickslightly
sweetboozy
warm
taste
is
delicious
bourbon
and
caramel
something
like
a
barrel
aged
ipa
sticky
super
boozy
but
in
an
appetizing
way
finishing
a
little
hot
for
my
taste
but
its
working
kind
of
struggling
to
hide
the
alcohol
reminds
me
of
old
stock
in
that
way
this
is
much
better
id
say
the
strong
notes
are
more
refined
than
that
o
exceptional
perfect
for
sipping
an
esb
transformed
into
something
else
altogether
o
very
good
beer
recommend
trying
if
you
can
find
it
sucaba
and
parabola
are
better
but
this
still
compares
to
them
a
little
cheaper
than
sucaba
and
parabola
but
still
very
good
o
awesome
the
coconut
and
vanilla
made
this
very
different
from
other
american
strong
ales
ive
had
i
loved
it
and
i
normally
hate
coconut
vanilla
and
bourbon
also
combine
with
a
very
good
mouth
to
make
a
very
good
brew
overall
a
nice
big
but
smooth
sipper
that
actually
goes
down
quite
easy
o
very
good
complexity
and
flavor
a
couple
more
months
of
age
and
i
think
this
beer
will
be
even
more
awesome
o
the
barrel
program
at
firestone
is
heads
and
tails
above
every
other
that
i
have
tried
and
this
is
no
exception
this
beer
seems
to
sit
on
the
shelves
in
my
area
and
now
im
glad
it
does
will
make
this
a
staple
in
my
rotation
very
nice
beer
perfect
for
sipping
maybe
not
exactly
suited
if
want
you
want
is
in
fact
a
english
pale
but
very
good
o
very
enjoyable
liked
it
as
well
or
perhaps
a
bit
more
than
the
dba
o
its
an
interesting
beer
that
is
subtle
but
strong
another
example
showing
that
firestone
walker
knows
how
to
use
barrels
overall
call
it
what
you
will
but
there
are
barrelaged
brews
out
there
that
dont
really
do
it
for
me
often
i
find
too
much
booziness
will
get
in
the
way
of
more
subtle
enjoyable
qualities
of
a
beer
this
one
is
no
exception
its
good
but
this
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
take
away
the
bourbon
flavors
and
this
beer
barely
has
a
leg
to
stand
on
its
own
othis
does
the
trick
big
beer
with
complex
flavors
that
holds
the
drinkers
attention
while
sipping
on
a
cold
day
drinks
more
like
a
spirit
than
beer
continues
to
improve
as
it
warms
well
done
overall
another
very
good
beer
from
firestone
walker
without
much
stylewise
to
compare
it
to
its
hard
to
say
how
truly
good
this
is
o
this
is
a
great
beer
itll
probably
put
me
to
sleep
but
thats
ok
addendum
opened
a
bottle
that
had
been
aged
1
year
bourbon
flavor
is
much
more
evident
but
all
remnants
of
alcohol
warmth
and
boozeyness
are
gone
all
carbonation
gone
becomes
a
little
thin
not
my
favorite
beer
that
ive
aged
lost
a
little
too
much
character
o
fantastic
as
far
as
fw
offerings
go
and
in
my
opinion
of
course
double
dba
is
a
more
complete
beer
than
say
14
15
or
abacus
and
every
bit
as
good
as
parabola
overall
more
evidence
that
firestone
walker
has
one
of
if
not
the
best
barrel
program
in
the
world
incredibly
complex
and
flavorful
while
at
the
same
time
maintaining
a
surprising
level
of
drinkability
this
ones
definitely
a
winner
classic
fsw
barrel
program
big
malt
sweetness
vanilla
toffee
and
dark
fruit
this
is
a
bourbon
neat
if
you
love
bourbon
and
gi
bcs
this
is
a
must
esp
the
price
13
is
a
steal
im
stunned
drink
now
or
cellar
just
simply
awesome
o
another
great
example
of
why
fw
is
the
best
at
barrel
aging
overall
an
interesting
beer
with
a
lot
of
complexity
really
rather
sweet
however
and
more
suitable
for
an
afterdinner
nip
as
a
result
o
a
very
tasty
and
complex
strong
ale
sweet
up
front
but
balanced
nicely
by
earthy
hops
and
a
spicy
alcohol
bite
a
true
delight
a
unique
barrel
aged
offering
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
firestone
walker
has
another
winner
here
lots
of
sweet
malty
goodness
in
this
nice
slow
sipper
that
full
of
depth
and
character
o
pretty
good
but
it
would
probably
benefit
from
some
more
aging
personally
i
prefer
my
lukcy
basartd
and
double
bastards
over
this
one
on
tap
pours
a
copper
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
settles
to
a
ring
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
lots
of
caramel
bourbon
vanilla
and
toffee
as
well
as
some
light
oak
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
some
sweetness
the
taste
is
sweet
with
lots
of
caramel
some
oak
some
light
bourbon
toffee
and
a
light
nuttiness
the
finish
is
toffee
and
some
lingering
barrel
notes
medium
body
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
another
great
beer
from
firestone
walker
but
a
bit
too
brash
after
only
six
months
in
the
bottle
i
feel
some
more
age
would
be
beneficial
for
the
flavors
to
mellow
and
mesh
and
i
will
be
revisiting
my
other
bottles
down
the
line
to
see
how
this
develops
this
is
sexy
boozy
the
barrel
is
brings
some
heat
the
base
beer
slinks
up
against
it
like
its
a
cold
night
and
it
is
excellent
beer
thats
warming
my
toes
kickin
off
my
slippers
ahhh
glad
to
have
copped
this
for
cheap
its
not
quite
on
the
level
as
sucaba
and
most
places
charge
upwards
of
20
for
it
again
this
smells
great
fruity
and
nutty
not
so
smokey
very
tasty
i
might
give
it
higher
marks
this
year
pours
a
deep
warm
shade
of
amber
small
light
beige
head
which
dissipates
to
nothing
filtered
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
rich
caramel
and
toffee
malt
flavors
theres
some
apricot
coconut
sugar
cane
almonds
and
cotton
candy
the
taste
is
sweet
and
luxurious
its
pretty
much
a
delicious
barleywine
with
light
barrel
notes
im
mostly
getting
vanilla
and
a
light
woodiness
from
the
barrelaging
theres
some
fairly
subtle
bourbon
in
the
background
but
it
meshes
into
the
other
notes
quite
nicely
some
booze
in
the
aroma
but
it
mostly
just
warms
up
the
palate
once
you
take
a
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
thick
but
it
never
got
cloying
for
me
this
is
one
of
the
best
barrelaged
beers
that
ive
had
from
fw
probably
my
second
favorite
after
sticky
monkey
one
of
the
barleywines
that
was
used
in
a
recent
fw
anniversary
beer
it
does
a
particularly
good
job
of
showing
fws
light
touch
with
barrelaging
great
stuff
o
i
was
way
more
impressed
by
this
one
than
i
thought
i
was
gonna
be
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
really
great
its
pretty
sweet
but
its
nowhere
near
cloying
pours
dark
orange
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
ring
aroma
is
typical
of
fw
barrels
rich
toasted
oak
sweet
caramel
malts
faint
dark
fruits
toasted
coconut
taste
is
huge
notes
of
toasted
coconut
american
oak
and
sweet
caramel
upfront
middle
of
the
mouth
brings
some
notes
of
rum
soaked
dark
fruits
and
slight
bitterness
to
cut
the
sweet
malts
finish
is
long
lasting
and
mouth
coating
no
alcohol
is
perceptible
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
creamy
another
great
fw
barrel
aged
beer
the
barrel
characteristics
are
remarkably
similar
among
these
beers
aroma
and
taste
were
very
similar
to
parabola
in
the
barrel
notes
until
the
crafting
of
the
beer
takes
you
in
a
different
direction
poured
from
bomber
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
solid
mahogany
and
amber
color
with
a
thin
crown
of
beige
foam
the
nose
is
dominated
by
vanilla
caramel
coconut
and
toasted
oak
characteristics
the
taste
starts
out
with
lots
of
toffee
brown
sugar
candied
date
and
caramel
malt
flavors
from
the
oak
theres
notes
of
vanilla
bourbon
and
caramelized
sugars
the
body
is
slightly
syrupy
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
dry
oaky
booze
burn
finish
overall
a
very
nice
double
strength
ale
overall
i
was
more
impressed
with
this
than
i
was
expecting
quite
good
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
over
sucaba
or
definitely
parabola
but
i
would
have
this
again
bottle
poured
into
duvel
glass
appearance
is
toffee
colored
gold
with
heavy
visual
weight
and
minimal
head
retention
nose
has
intense
rush
of
bourbon
up
front
with
heavy
carmel
malt
character
to
follow
notes
of
honey
and
pine
come
through
at
the
end
taste
starts
with
rich
molasses
and
plenty
of
malty
sweetness
vanilla
and
oak
come
next
with
a
sharp
boozy
punch
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
heavy
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
the
bourbon
bomb
the
base
beer
doesnt
seems
to
hold
up
the
flavors
as
well
as
a
stout
or
barleywine
also
a
bit
hot
o
well
i
must
say
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
brew
i
forgot
to
mention
i
was
drinking
this
alongside
of
a
boltcutter
and
a
2010
bourbon
county
vanilla
stout
both
very
different
beers
but
just
as
big
it
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
could
be
better
and
im
sure
it
will
be
from
the
bottle
conditioning
and
some
age
which
will
help
blend
the
flavors
and
mellow
the
alcohol
id
like
to
try
the
base
beer
too
ill
update
my
review
when
i
revisit
another
interesting
barrel
aged
concoction
from
fw
and
im
not
surprised
copp
a
bottle
and
age
awhile
m
medium
body
slightly
sticky
low
carbonation
2012
vintage
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
boozey
with
some
dark
fruits
brown
sugar
some
spices
and
caramel
earthy
with
some
nice
notes
from
the
barrel
the
tastes
is
earthy
booze
upfront
with
some
sweet
caramel
vanilla
and
booze
at
the
finish
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
scotch
ale
heavy
mouthfeel
pretty
tasty
slow
sipper
with
a
nice
boozey
barrel
aged
flavor
overall
another
hit
by
firestone
walker
o
overall
boozy
solidly
brewed
clean
making
for
a
smooth
malt
bomb
to
sip
slowly
by
the
fireplace
on
a
wintery
night
pours
amber
with
very
little
head
aromas
of
bread
heavy
sugar
and
hard
candy
vanilla
toffee
maybe
with
some
oaky
scotch
slight
hops
in
the
smell
i
can
tell
this
will
be
intense
flavor
is
very
sweet
to
start
but
seems
to
mellow
out
to
keep
it
from
being
too
too
cloying
still
a
bit
overly
sweet
for
my
liking
flavor
of
brown
sugar
candy
toffee
and
vanilla
ever
so
slight
bitter
on
the
finish
with
strong
booze
lingering
a
bit
very
much
highlights
the
english
malt
here
the
barrel
aging
definitely
comes
out
in
this
one
heavy
slick
mouthfeel
very
interesting
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
likely
seek
it
out
again
thats
not
to
say
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
if
offered
o
man
is
this
tasty
one
of
the
best
tasting
strong
ales
i
have
had
why
oh
why
didnt
i
age
this
longer
answer
it
was
thanksgiving
and
i
my
resolve
crumbled
besides
the
flaw
of
being
a
little
too
boozy
i
found
it
could
use
a
little
more
body
as
well
but
dont
let
that
talk
you
out
of
trying
it
this
is
still
an
exceptional
and
rare
treat
nice
job
fw
overall
another
very
good
barrel
aged
beer
from
firestone
walker
this
is
a
big
potent
beer
very
much
a
sipper
but
really
nice
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
all
of
it
good
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
another
great
beer
from
fw
a
delight
o
as
the
side
of
the
box
says
this
beer
was
brewed
to
be
a
blending
beer
which
is
exactly
what
it
is
while
it
certainly
showcases
the
barrel
in
a
way
no
other
beer
does
it
just
seems
incapable
of
existing
on
its
own
bringing
little
to
the
party
other
than
barrel
flavor
i
have
a
hard
time
faulting
this
beer
for
being
something
it
was
not
intended
to
be
its
like
faulting
cook
county
stout
for
not
being
bcbs
however
the
difference
is
that
gi
has
never
bottled
and
released
cook
county
stout
as
a
standalone
beer
like
i
said
the
beer
is
just
more
of
an
engine
to
carry
the
barrel
flavors
which
is
fine
firestone
does
barrels
better
than
almost
anyone
like
a
mild
barrelaged
barley
wine
o
man
what
a
great
beer
not
sure
the
style
but
still
great
nevertheless
srm
27
dark
ruby
overall
this
is
a
pretty
well
crafted
beer
by
fw
seems
like
it
could
use
some
more
hopping
to
balance
the
sweetness
this
is
a
pretty
fun
beer
to
try
if
you
want
to
swing
the
price
tag
having
had
abacussucaba
i
dont
feel
that
double
dba
reaches
that
level
of
magnificence
but
its
still
an
exceedingly
strong
example
of
a
big
barrelaged
ale
22oz
bottle
shared
with
a
friend
pours
brownishred
topped
with
a
thin
beige
head
aromas
are
huge
with
bourbon
more
bourbon
brown
sugar
oak
booze
caramel
toffee
and
vanilla
tastes
are
just
as
full
vanilla
oak
bourbon
toffee
buttery
brown
sugar
caramel
cotton
candy
sweeeet
but
not
cloyingly
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
mediumtofull
bodied
overall
very
nice
treat
but
for
the
price
id
probably
never
get
it
again
trust
me
this
beer
is
worth
the
price
youll
pay
for
it
heck
get
two
and
save
one
for
when
the
world
comes
to
a
end
and
enjoy
medium
body
medium
carbonation
just
a
touch
of
stickiness
really
enjoyable
even
if
it
falls
a
hair
shy
of
profundity
get
ready
for
a
sugary
whiskey
treat
as
a
whole
this
is
excellent
beer
the
barrel
aging
brings
a
fantastic
oak
and
vanilla
tone
to
what
was
obviously
already
a
wellcrafted
brew
and
the
flavors
mingle
together
deliciously
the
whiskey
flavors
do
tend
to
overpower
the
latter
half
of
the
mouthful
and
the
aftertaste
is
almost
completely
dominated
by
bourbon
making
the
high
12
abv
leave
ones
breath
feeling
as
if
it
could
tarnish
silver
but
even
here
this
works
well
with
the
beer
and
the
next
sip
brings
fresh
berry
and
sugar
notes
to
blend
marvelously
with
the
whiskey
vapors
recommended
o
very
interesting
beer
the
sweetness
was
surprising
but
a
real
treat
i
dont
know
how
many
more
chances
ill
get
to
try
this
but
ill
certainly
get
it
again
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into

the
pour
is
a
deep
amber
moderate

decent

it

is

exceeded
expectations
my
vote
would
be
to
call
this
a
quadruple
barrel
ale
and
theyre
out
in
full
regalia
the
taste
follows
very
closely
in

nice

again
an
herbal
bitterness
that
makes
me
think
of
this
as
more
an
imperial

than
a
barleywine
nicely
balanced
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
sipper
but
pretty
smooth
considering
whats
going
on
in
it
i
liked
this
one
d
far
too
easy
to
drink
for
a
10
beer
stealthy
recommended
should
be
served
in
small
doses
or
risk
getting
carried
away
d
minimal
heat
great
flavor
very
easy
drinking
for
a
10
brew
reminds
me
a
little
of
struise
rocking
horse
but
without
the
amazing
hop
flavors
d
a
very
fullbodied
strong
beer
a
sipper
for
sure
d
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
was
well
suited
to
the
cask
would
drink
again
serving
type
bottle
a
massive
let
down
red
fruits
cloyingly
sweet
brown
sugar
huge
residual
sugars
and
next
to
no
barrel
presence
as
a
barleywine
its
disappointing
as
a
hill
farmstead
barrel
aged
barleywine
its
a
huge
disappointment
understanding
taste
is
subjective
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
too
many
people
are
tasting
the
rare
here
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
while
this
beer
has
the
hype
it
doesnt
live
up
overall
just
too
sweet
with
no
barrel
this
beer
fell
short
mostly
on
the
taste
and
feel
it
was
almost
long
the
lines
of
fun
dip
or
pixie
sticks
a
fun
try
and
i
love
their
beer
normally
just
not
this
one
apparently
not
sure
ive
ever
experienced
so
much
rich
bourbon
flavor
without
tasting
boozy
rich
caramel
flavors
dominate
really
nice
want
more
overall
this
was
very
good
it
has
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
to
it
so
if
you
like
that
characteristic
in
your
barleywines
youll
love
this
one
well
worth
checking
out
solid
barleywine
leon
definitely
beat
it
though
for
me
tasted
similar
to
great
the
beer
is
clean
subtle
and
refined
just
as
expected
it
could
explode
with
more
richness
but
still
one
of
the
better
bourbon
barrel
barleywines
out
there
overall
a
top
notch
beer
as
its
reputation
claims
great
balance
between
a
malty
and
sweet
barleywine
and
a
rich
bourbon
aged
beer
love
the
balance
on
this
one
o
easily
the
best
barleywine
i
have
had
spot
on
in
all
the
right
places
essentially
perfect
not
just
one
of
the
best
barleywines
but
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
too
sweet
for
me
bros
its
kind
of
rare
nowadays
to
find
a
barleywine
that
hasnt
been
gobbled
up
by
barrels
and
their
corresponding
flavors
so
that
makes
this
particular
brew
extra
enjoyable
its
a
gem
for
sure
a
little
curious
very
sweet
but
not
heavy
lot
of
apple
hard
to
believe
this
is
just
bourbon
barrels
could
use
more
carbonation
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
o
this
could
be
my
favorite
ba
barley
wine
but
im
totally
biased
since
im
not
too
into
the
style
im
very
seasonal
with
this
style
but
this
one
i
could
actually
drink
year
around
super
surprised
by
how
smooth
and
refreshing
it
is
i
need
more
onot
a
bourbon
bomb
at
all
more
of
a
balanced
english
barleywine
the
flavors
are
not
mind
blowing
but
the
balance
is
so
dialed
in
overall
this
is
a
really
fantastic
beer
just
about
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
real
nice
for
a
brewerys
first
barleywine
i
am
not
typically
a
barley
wine
drinker
but
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
so
well
offset
by
the
vanilla
oak
presence
i
am
left
longing
for
the
next
sip
this
beer
just
transcends
style
and
showcases
the
hf
ba
program
yet
again
impressed
big
thanks
to
ineedabeerhere
thanks
joe
for
the
chance
to
try
this
amazing
beer
pours
slightly
darker
than
mahogany
with
no
headjust
a
soapy
slick
nose
is
booze
and
sugary
with
some
toffee
notes
taste
is
amazing
everything
an
english
barleywine
should
be
sugary
figs
and
maple
syrup
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
an
almost
still
carbonation
this
is
just
an
amazing
barleywine
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
ive
had
to
date
o
huge
complex
beer
with
tons
of
flavor
and
booze
maybe
a
bit
too
boozy
but
im
not
complaining
going
to
ask
the
wife
to
hide
the
three
bottles
in
the
basement
so
im
not
tempted
to
pop
another
one
open
before
next
year
keith
really
appreciate
it
a
good
representation
of
an
english
barleywine
so
many
barleywines
are
now
the
american
version
and
heavily
hopped
this
was
a
nice
sweet
malty
english
version
through
and
through
from
a
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
is
a
rich
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
woody
scents
heavy
on
malt
and
alcohol
low
on
fruit
scents
but
very
earthy
the
taste
is
intense
but
pleasant
warming
and
stong
not
overly
sweet
not
has
a
sweet
spice
flavor
full
mouthfeel
great
barley
wine
this
is
another
case
of
a
beer
that
grew
on
me
will
definitely
have
to
try
this
again
and
expect
my
rating
might
rise
or
maybe
the
fact
the
next
batch
is
always
worse
will
balance
that
out
poured
into
a
fremont
small
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
appearing
nearly
opaque
black
in
the
glass
with
a
thick
khaki
cap
that
dissipates
to
thin
patches
with
little
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
fresh
and
dried
dark
fruit
particularly
plums
and
raisins
concord
grape
fruitier
than
expected
for
this
style
but
pleasant
flavor
is
similar
dominated
by
plums
raisins
dates
currents
light
red
wine
notes
of
oak
tannin
caramel
malt
earthy
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
light
carbonation
not
an
american
barleywine
little
hops
and
not
a
traditional
english
one
either
with
more
of
a
dark
fruit
profile
rather
than
caramel
malt
a
nice
change
of
pace
flavor
for
a
barleywine
well
integrated
flavors
and
moderately
complex
nicely
made
and
different
each
taste
surprises
me
with
the
fruit
flavors
which
im
still
not
expecting
from
what
is
clearly
a
barleywine
abv
well
covered
but
this
is
warming
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
weak
and
that
is
the
only
flaw
i
found
in
this
im
hoping
to
find
a
second
bottle
for
ageing
since
this
has
such
an
interesting
flavor
usually
the
malt
is
the
dominating
flavor
change
in
aged
barleywines
here
it
will
be
the
other
flavors
intriguing
c
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
i
have
had
in
a
while
and
easily
one
of
the
ten
best
made
in
the
u
s
that
i
have
ever
tried
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
one
that
i
enjoyed
often
when
living
in
britain
i
feel
many
craft
breweries
lose
the
essence
of
this
style
looking
for
innovation
whereas
this
brew
strikes
a
perfect
balance
between
ambition
and
tradition
a
really
satisfying
barley
wine
o
enjoyable
but
missing
that
little
something
to
make
it
outstanding
pours
a
hazy
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
toffee
and
honey
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
toast
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
earth
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
nice
caramel
toffee
and
honey
qualities
all
around
poured
a
dark
brown
body
with
lace
patches
stuck
to
the
glass
on
top
of
an
aroma
that
is
figs
and
dark
fruit
along
with
touches
of
bourbon
and
wood
along
with
some
sweetness
the
beer
is
thickfull
but
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
some
oakiness
body
is
chewy
at
times
and
has
a
real
good
sweet
edge
thanks
to
vanillacaramel
taste
notes
and
possible
dark
fruits
along
with
figs
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
and
this
beer
seemed
to
hit
it
often
and
this
was
complemented
by
a
slightly
hot
boozy
finish
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
pours
mildly
translucent
nice
tan
head
very
maltthick
nose
raisin
and
a
mild
maple
thing
is
on
there
also
seems
a
bit
boozy
also
unfortunately
flavor
is
pretty
decent
kind
of
seems
a
bit
too
clogged
with
a
mild
boozy
edge
and
a
whole
lot
of
malty
sweetness
a
shame
really
as
it
exhibits
a
lot
of
characteristics
you
want
to
see
for
the
style
after
16
months
i
wouldnt
imagine
it
to
be
like
this
though
maybe
its
just
not
a
good
barleywine
for
aging
o
to
me
the
beer
is
a
bit
overly
sweet
not
something
id
normally
go
after
quite
a
neat
take
on
a
barleywine
and
drinks
very
nicely
to
match
and
easily
great
solid
brew
from
these
guys
overall

a
really
solid
barleywine
that
if
i
had
my
choice
i
would
drink
with
about
a
year
on
it
i
like
the
added
sweetness
and
the
fact
that
the
booze
has
blended
in
to
create
a
more
cohesive
beer
both
are
great
thoughi
would
encourage
anyone
who
has
the
opportunity
to
try
them
sidebyside
having
tried
them
both
i
will
definitely
be
sitting
on
my
2013
for
a
year
or
so
overall
this
would
do
well
in
a
barrel
sugar
bomb
this
is
a
greatoffthe
shelf
barlywine
a
definite
goto
for
me
in
the
future
its
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
for
a
bwine
but
it
still
nice
and
refreshing
rock
solid
barleywine
ale
here
pouring
a
decadent
toffee
amber
color
and
sporting
over
an
inch
of
yellowish
fluff
the
nose
on
this
is
all
brown
sugar
and
maple
syrup
one
sugar
layer
cuts
through
the
next
deep
and
rich
for
sure
with
all
the
grain
in
your
face
you
could
ever
want
fresh
and
strong
wintery
sexy
the
flavor
is
similarly
robustly
flavored
with
more
molasses
this
time
around
even
honey
i
taste
a
million
sweeteners
without
a
ton
of
residual
sugar
tough
to
do
and
in
this
case
done
beautifully
the
grains
are
fresh
and
anywhere
from
lightly
toasted
to
close
to
burnt
its
also
got
a
strange
but
enjoyable
candied
orange
peel
flavor
towards
the
finish
before
the
booze
comes
in
i
like
to
taste
the
alcohol
just
a
bit
in
my
barleywine
and
this
one
has
that
aspect
dialed
long
rich
finish
cleaned
away
by
alcohol
huge
body
this
is
a
slow
sipper
but
it
improves
with
warmth
so
no
rush
perennial
can
do
no
wrong
right
now
very
nice
beer
from
this
new
to
me
brewery
thanks
casey
d
this
was
a
great
english
barleywine
with
solid
scent
and
taste
and
an
excellent
body
the
finish
was
smooth
but
it
was
a
little
hot
so
it
was
better
to
sip
age
may
help
mellow
very
nice
brew
but
pricey
o
this
is
really
good
another
high
quality
brew
from
perennial
overall
nice
strong
brew
very
tasty
and
definitely
comparable
to
many
of
the
old
school
english
barleywines
no
many
beer
get
better
with
age
most
just
evolve
my
guess
is
that
this
will
do
both
though
it
is
great
to
drink
right
now
as
well
o
this
is
interesting
but
id
prefer
it
to
be
a
little
less
sweet
as
it
is
the
sweetness
clashes
with
the
peatiness
a
little
bit
o
1st
offering
by
perennial
and
this
one
was
just
simply
weird
for
its
denoted
style
i
really
picked
up
on
a
ton
of
nuts
and
smokiness
in
this
one
which
i
was
never
expecting
however
it
it
is
labeled
a
winter
ale
so
the
play
on
the
season
is
definitely
in
full
effect
i
just
dont
think
it
is
that
well
balanced
for
its
style
overall
this
is
tasty
enough
to
drink
another
part
of
me
wanted
to
not
like
this
beer
but
to
be
honest
this
is
worthy
of
a
try
it
isnt
nearly
my
favorite
english
barleywine
but
it
is
a
more
than
acceptable
effort
one
of
a
large
number
of
samples
i
had
at
the
extreme
beer
fest
in
boston
32132014
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
not
a
regular
drinker
of
barleywines
but
this
one
is
very
good
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
very
drinkable
especially
since
its

i
enjoy

sugary
bourbon
figs
with
a

earthiness

flavor
is
fantastic
with

in
big
ways
some
dried

come
through
too
along
with
a
hint
of
woody
maple
feel
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
a
lingering
sugary
sweetness
and
low
carbonation

this
is
a

beer

is

god
bless
you
jacks
abby
phenomenal
beer
maybe
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
taste
is
vanilla
bourbon
caramel
and
oak
a
sipper
due
to
the
complexity
of
flavors
that
unravel
with
each
sip
this
is
right
up
there
with
firestone
walkers
english
barleywines
for
being
the
king
in
a
really
good
style
well
done
jacks
abby
caramel
vanilla
toffee
and
oak
good
amount
of
sweetness
so
smooth
no
alcohol
heat
at
all
delicious
a
lot
of
malt
and
caramel
not
my
favorite
offering
by
them
but
not
the
worst
dark
caramel
color
very
malty
the
sweetness
lingers
for
a
long
time
i
liked
it
a
lot
but
should
have
shared
this
with
a
buddy
2
glasses
might
be
an
overload
of
malt
flavor
that
being
said
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
in
2
years
it
should
mellow
out
and
develop
nicely
not
my
favorite
jacks
abby
offering
this
brew
is
very
sweet
with
too
much
carmel
for
my
tastes
pours
lushly
with
a
deep
amber
that
is
blushing
a
touch
of
red
the
color
of
brick
orange
softly
hazy
from
its
depths
rather
than
from
any
actual
haze
its
simply
dappled
with
golden
hues
and
not
thin
so
it
has
a
lovely
glow
to
it
i
poured
into
a
small
tasting
glass
so
no
head
but
i
do
have
bubbles
that
refresh
on
each
tip
spots
that
cling
with
alcohol
legs
and
a
very
thin
ring
my
first
impression
of
the
nose
was
almond
with
the
skin
of
the
almond
nutty
honey
molasses
sweet
grain
and
a
lazy
bourbon
scent
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
some
decadent
dried
dark
fruits
taste
is
sumptuous
not
cloying
but
has
an
actual
lip
smacking
stickiness
to
it
there
is
caramel
and
toffee
a
honey
sweetness
over
the
top
of
nuts
dried
dark
fruits
give
it
gaiety
and
its
like
a
rich
sticky
bread
with
days
of
sweetness
in
it
no
heat
from
alcohol
at
all
this
finishes
soft
and
without
much
carbonation
positively
seductive
the
aroma
lead
me
on
to
the
lager
wine
aspect
of
the
beer
while
i
found
more
complexity
from
the
barrels
malts
and
yeast
in
the
flavor
for
13
this
is
borderline
insane
but
in
the
end
a
huge
sweetness
keeps
it
from
truly
being
amazing
in
the
end
its
great
minus
the
sweets
and
one
must
be
reminded
its
a
lager
keep
it
up
jacks
abby
framinghammer
gets
a
lot
of
publicity
from
jacks
abbey
but
this
beer
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
awesome
from
the
nose
to
the
taste
to
the
way
it
goes
down
definitely
worth
seeking
out
seriously
i
thought
this
was
awful
just
too
damn
hot
boozy
and
cloyingly
sweet
maybe
i
dont
know
wtf
i
am
talking
about
but
ive
had
plenty
of
barley
wines
that
ive
enjoyed
before
sadly
this
was
not
one
of
them
blech
i
did
not
know
at
first
that
this
was
a
barrel
aged
beer
the
aroma
suggested
barrel
aging
the
taste
confirmed
though
it
is
a
subtle
barrel
presence
very
deep
garnet
colored
with
very
little
to
no
head
some
spots
cling
to
the
glass
aroma
of
stewed
fruits
caramel
toffee
vanilla
cherry
and
a
good
bit
of
prunes
brown
sugar
also
presents
itself
taste
sweet
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
bordering
on
cloying
tastes
of
cherry
and
vanilla
toasted
oak
and
toffee
a
little
burn
on
the
finish
slick
oily
thick
as
stated
kind
cloying
in
the
end
i
would
like
this
a
little
dryer
perhaps
aging
this
one
would
be
proper
if
i
see
it
again
id
pick
one
up
and
cellar
it
this
lager
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
zero
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
marshmallows
and
hints
of
bourbon
flavors
are
more
pronounced
with
a
blend
of
vanilla
toffee
caramel
black
cherries
candy
sugar
and
bourbon
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
syrupy
low
carbonation
which
lends
itself
well
to
the
beer
really
an
excellent
alternative
to
a
barleywine
way
too
sweet
sweetest
beer
ive
ever
had
pours
very
dark
with
minimal
very
thin
head
smells
and
taste
of
both
carmel
and
bourbon
the
bourbon
perfect
not
overpowering
overall
great
barrel
aged
beer
from
ja
overall
incredible
seek
this
brew
out
immediately
overall
im
am
blown
away
by
this

despite
the
change
in
recipe
o
a
nice
offering
by
against
the
grain
the
bourbon
flavor
isnt
overpowering
the
hoppy
profile
makes
it
seem
a
little
closer
to
an
american
style
barleywine
however
nice
rich
color
but
a
sadly
depleted
head
nicely
diverse
nose
of
bourbon
pina
colada
oranges
some
dark
fruit
light

and
caramel
the

a
touch
subdued
but
delicious
none
the
less
sweet
bourbon
creme
toffee
caramel
bourbon
whiskey
and
dry
oak
wood
meet
the
palate
but
it
ends
lightly
fruity
this
is
very
thin
and
the
alcohol
heat
is
not
hidden
but
despite
this
flaw
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
nice
price
louisville

on
holiday
trip
a
little
hoppy
for
an
english
barleywine
bourbon
ads
a
nice
complexity
i
wish
i
would
of
let
this
one
sit
for
a
while
in
the
end
the
light
mouthfeel
and
heat
detract
from
this

despite

just

sorry
overall

not

this
is
delicious
flavors
are
balanced
overall
more
than
most
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywines
ive
had
for
the
price
are
sure
buy
again
and
another
solid
offering
from
this
brewery
overall
first
experience
with
against
the
grain
and
i
am
very
impressed
hits
all
the
checkpoints
a
great
bba
english
barleywine
should
bottle
from
hop
city
when
i
visited
atlanta
pours
murky
brownish

into
my
glass
with

nice
medium
plus
bodied

heat
and
carbonation
that
is
medium
plus
maybe
a
bit
much
for
the
style
tastes
better
than
it
smells
pretty
good
stuff
with
heavy
barrel
notes
pours
a
viscous
hazy
lighter
brown
color
with
a

has
has
a

of

aromas
forward
in
the
nose
along
with

follows
the

with

flavors
along
with

tobacco

in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thick
in
body
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
a
very
well
done
bba
barleywine
great
base
beer
and
a
good
addition
of
a
bourbon
character
great
vanilla
and
oak
character
definitely
worth
a
try
but
has
some
tough
competition
in
its
category
very
boozy
sweet
treacle
aroma
with
toasted
oak
notes
and
hints
of
raisins
flavor
reveals
a
very
sweet
backbone
with
huge
caramel
tones
and
a
moderately
bitter
oaky
finish
bourbon
notes
and
vanilla
add
complexity
dates
dominate
the
profile
the
oak
in
the
finish
provides
nice
balance
should
age
well
id
like
more
complex
dark
fruit
character
this
is
quite
tasty
it
doesnt
quite
match
up
to
the
biggest
barrelaged
barleywines
that
all
the
kids
are
talking
about
but
its
still
very
good
decadent
in
finish
the
fullbodied
taste
and
texture
weighs
on
the
tongue
and
saturates
the
tastebuds
to
utter
completion
with
its
piercing
booze
and
understated
carbonated
lift
its
barley
liquor
character
numbs
the
palate
and
seduces
the
taste
with
its
boldly
laced
savory
character
enjoy
much
more
as
an
after
dinner
aperitif
rather
than
a
drinkable
or
refresher
of
a
beer
solid
all
around
bottom
line
i
would
seek
this
out
again
from
a
12
oz
bottle
the
firstever
bottle
release
of
this
beer
at
bo
luke
day
really
sweet
aroma
and
all
of
the
wonderful
range
of
flavors
in
a
barleywine
without
being
so
sweet
it
feels
like
your
teeth
are
rotting
if
this
gets
out
for
distribution
dont
miss
it
o
nice
suprise
on
this
one
picked
it
up
at
bo
luke
day
2014
from
atg
overall
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
there
is
just
enough
barrel
aging
to
impart
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
characteristics
but
without
drowning
out
the
base
barleywine
the
sweetness
is
pleasant
and
not
cloying
enticing
swallow
after
swallow
i
will
say
that
the
80
ibus
surprises
me
on
this
one
but
perhaps
thats
the
key
to
preventing
a
sweet
beer
from
becoming
overly
so
o
this
was
some
good
stuff
and
my
first
beer
of
the
festival
very
good
use
of
the
barrel
and
not
overpowering
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
12
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
liquor
wood
yeast
and
slight
dry
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
english
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
liquor
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
hops
sight
roasted
malt
and
slight
wood
overall
good
appearance
aroma
body
blend
and
complexity
overall
the
most
enjoyable
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
quality
of
the
barreling
throughout
the
flavoring
top
notch
the
wood
added
undisputable
authenticity
of
bourbon
and
heavy
heavy
heavy
oakiness
both
of
which
lent
a
balancing
bitterness
to
the
cloy
of
the
malts
and
residual
alcohol
sugars
the
nose
and
feel
complement
the
taste
well
comfortably
marking
this
beer
as
a
knockout
there
are
so
many
layers
to
the
aroma
and
it
just
becomes
stickier
and
stickier
with
each
passing
moment
we
also
loved
how
it
left
your
mouth
both
cleanly
sweetened
and
dryly
chalked
without
offense
from
either
the
bitters
of
the
cloy
this
is
a
stellar
english
barleywine
and
should
be
a
foremost
example
along
with
the
likes
of
artic
devil
of
how
to
properly
utilizing
barreling
deep
dark
chestnut
brown
under
a
low
but
very
sticky
bubbly
head
smooth
sticky
dark
malt
aromas
raisin
wortlike
smells
toffee
plum
cherry
and
a
fairly
mellow
barrel
character
with
some
vanilla
creaminess
smooth
caramel
vanilla
oaky
spice
dark
fruit
black
tea
light
sherry
nuts
and
cherry
dry
with
a
quick
tidy
finish
not
cloying
in
the
slightest
and
the
bourbon
isnt
boozy
surprising
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
heavy
and
smooth
not
too
much
barrel
or
sticky
sweetness
for
its
strength
pretty
nice
o
very
good
beer
that
i
would
gladly
sip
any
chance
i
got
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
are
like
a
great
kindergarten
class
it
plays
well
with
others
and
makes
even
the
grumpiest
grownup
smile
and
reflect
on
the
the
amazing
simple
joys
of
life
very
well
done
must
resist
making
clash
joke
whew
that
was
harder
than
it
should
have
been
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
garnet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
caramel
sweet
toffee
light
oak
light
walnut
mild
vanilla
bean
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
in
the
background
everything
coalesces
amiably
around
a
thin
core
of
mild
booze
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
bit
of
bourbon
a
heightened
sense
of
fruitiness
and
some
added
sweetness
from
a
buttercream
character
damn
this
is
some
tasty
shit
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bwine
possibly
the
best
atg
has
made
at
least
from
the
selection
weve
received
here
in
chicago
thus
far
get
some
sweet
toffee
caramel
and
vanilla
in
the
aroma
sweet
with
some
depth
to
it
rich
toffee
flavor
punctuated
by
an
odd
sweet
candy
note
like
gummy
fruit
to
be
hyper
specific
raspberry
nordic
sweets
forest
berries
gummy
candy
strange
could
be
the
port
sweetness
coming
through
possibly
smooth
feel
rich
and
not
overly
cloying
but
the
candy
note
is
ever
present
dry
malty
finish
worth
a
try
though
the
flavors
didnt
really
coalesce
to
me
o
a
solid
beer
from
against
the
grain
that
makes
me
want
to
try
to
find
more
of
their
beers
has
a
great
smell
and
a
complex
flavor
profile
i
would
like
it
to
be
just
a
bit
smoother
like
that
it
takes
a
strong
presence
from
the
bourbon
barrel
4
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
the
drinkability
is
rather
high
and
since
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
it
quickly
sneaks
up
on
you
by
no
means
is
this
a
king
henry
but
a
growler
for
10
this
is
awesome
complexity
is
very
well
balanced
one
other
thing
dear
atg
please
bottle
this
stuff
so
i
can
trade
it
its
wrong
to
keep
this
good
a
beer
entirely
within
our
state
o
this
is
a
very
nice
english
barleywine
try
it
if
you
get
the
opportunity
o
ive
wanted
to
try
a
barrelaged
barleywine
for
a
long
time
and
it
was
awesome
to
find
this
one
right
in
my
backyard
even
better
the
guys
running
the
place
are
passionate
and
doing
it
for
the
right
reasons
a
great
brew
that
i
highly
recommend
great
job
atg
my
favorite
so
far
there
very
nice
barleywine
ale
smell
banana
and
orange
peel
slight
taste
banana
molasses
some
orange
and
other
citrus
notes
with
some
floral
i
assume
from
the
hops
the
finish
has
a
brown
sugar
finish
there
is
a
very
slight
alcohol
taste
feel
smooth
and
full
overall
a
nice
ale
and
unlike
the
traditional
barleywines
it
doesnt
have
that
really
sweet
taste
very
drinkable
overall
tasted
this
together
with
the
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
while
they
are
both
barleywines
the
nose
and
palate
are
very
different
between
the
two
whereas
bigfoot
has
a
big
resinous
hop
balance
to
the
sweet
caramel
malt
the
foghorn
is
dominated
by
rich
banana
malt
with
a
moderate
herbal
hops
balance
my
first
reaction
was
that
i
preferred
the
bigfoot
but
the
foghorn
grew
on
me
as
i
continued
to
sip
a
rich
and
complex
brew
more
of
an
american
barleywine
than
english
as
the
hop
presence
is
strong
but
not
as
intense
as
something
like
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
a
nice
sipping
beer
great
for
a
nightcap
i
think
its
the
test
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
enjoyed
this
enough
to
have
a
couple
of
them
i
feel
there
is
a
common
maltypine
taste
that
i
get
in
some
sips
that
is
offputting
but
i
am
willing
to
discount
a
bit
based
on
other
ambient
factors
definitely
one
og
the
better
anchor
beers
ive
had
o
this
is
my
first
time
tasting
and
im
on
my
second
bottle
this
my
be
the
best
barleywine
for
those
new
to
the
style
very
good
overall
very
enjoyable
very
sweet
malts
and
fruits
combine
for
a
fruitcakelike
quality
to
this
beer
this
teeters
more
towards
an
american
style
barleywine
as
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
but
lots
of
toasted
malts
lots
of
bright
fruits
fairly
warming
for
the
lower
abv
on
the
2014
vintage
of
8
8
came
in
a
chalice
perhaps
a
shot
glass
would
have
been
more
appropriate
this
beer
had
all
kinds
of
stuff
floating
in
my
glass
not
sure
what
happened
overall
sharp
and
flavourful
this
beer
is
damned
fine
and
packs
a
punch
a
great
sipping
beer
for
a
movie
or
a
long
game
of
cricket
a
solid
clean
and
very
british
barley
wine
had
not
had
this
in
years
but
picked
it
up
last
wknd
while
this
is
certainly
not
the
most
complex
bold
barleywine
out
there
these
days
it
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
i
were
to
have
the
option
of
trying
something
i
have
not
had
before
or
this
i
would
choose
to
try
the
new
one
still
this
is
good
ale
2004
7oz
bottle
pour
carefully
lots
of

years
didnt
identify
aroma
looking
for
malty
with
a
hint
of

faint
orange
taste
along
with
belgian
yeast
sweet
and
not
overly
hoppy
but
has
a
slight
bitter
finish
very
tasty
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
this
was
a
peculiar
beer
for
me
each
sip
changed
sometimes
it
would
be
pleasantly
spicy
other
times
it
would
feel
muddy
i
had
a
hard
time
categorizing
what
was
going
on
ultimately
it
left
me
with
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
and
while
i
love
this
brewery
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
be
buying
in
the
future
a
simpler
than
usual
barleywine
nice
and
traditionally
english
malty
with
a
nice
fruity
freshness
solid
enough
to
be
remembered
overall
a
well
crafted
english
barleywine
with
all
flavours
working
in
unison
a
definite
try
if
you
stumble
across
this
one
as
it
wont
disappoint
best
american
commercial
barleywine
by
far
wonderful
fresh
and
ages
well
a
great
barleywine
from
anchor
not
especially
hoppy
but
otherwise
pleasantly
flavorful
the
malt
is
rich
and
sweet
but
not
overwhelming
the
alcohol
lends
considerable
dryness
but
goes
rather
well
with
the
bitterness
overall
a
great
english
style
barleywine
lots
of
malt
complexity
without
getting
too
muddled
and
provides
much
depth
im
curious
as
to
how
some
age
will
affect
it
very
creamy
chewy
medium
carbonation
some
warming
overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
very
delicious
barleywine
it
has
great
bready
fruity
sweet
flavors
wrapped
up
in
a
very
pleasant
chewy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
while
there
are
stronger
more
flavorful
barleywines
out
there
now
this
one
mustve
been
revolutionary
back
in
1975
when
it
was
first
brewed
and
released
definitely
worth
a
drink
ive
enjoyed
different
beers
from
the
same
brewery
but
i
found
9
4
too
strong
for
this
particular
type
of
ale
a
bit
too
sweet
somethings
just
amiss
id
drink
it
again
just
not
sure
id
run
to
buy
it
o
i
havent
had
a
whole
lot
of
barleywines
even
less
english
barleywines
so
im
certainly
a
bit
out
of
my
element
in
regards
to
this
beers
representation
of
the
style
this
is
based
more
on
my
general
opinions
a
pretty
good
beer
though
i
wouldnt
ever
turn
one
down
o
considered
a
standard
by
many
in
the
beer
world
for
a
barleywine
i
was
glad
to
finally
find
this
on
the
east
coast
at
brawleys
beverage
in
charlotte
drank
in
boca
raton
july
12th
2014
o
definitely
a
sweeter
barleywine
with
a
lot
of
residual
sugars
but
still
quite
drinkable
if
not
very
complex
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
since
this
is
the
oldest
beer
ive
ever
tried
up
to
this
point
but
its
really
held
up
well
while
it
does
fit
the
more
maltforward
profile
of
an
english
barleywine
i
also
think
it
walks
a
nice
line
between
the
english
and
american
barleywine
styles
with
a
little
bit
of
american
hoppiness
to
balance
the
sweet
english
maltiness
rather
nice
though
i
feel
that
attenuating
the
sweetness
and
booze
slightly
would
be
beneficial
looks
alright
in
spite
of
the
floating
yeastprotein
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
similar
with
a
backbone
of
sweet
fruity
malt
and
subtle
hop
notes
fantastic
body
borders
on
unctuous
very
sweet
but
a
pleasant
sipper
would
be
perfect
for
winter
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
chance
o
i
already
thought
that
this
was
a
great
beer
but
the
age
has
really
mellowed
out
the
flavor
and
made
the
abv
disappear
great
beer
in
the
aroma
theres
a
tart
fuming
fusile
alcohol
that
reminds
one
of
hendricks
gin
o
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
flavors
are
bold
but
effortless
nature
of
this
one
is
really
impressive
given
that
its
a
bit
lighter
for
the
style
this
is
one
that
could
pair
well
with
scallops
duck
or
game
meats
o
my
second
of
this
style
and
it
seems
to
be
an
acquired
taste
but
at
least
i
can
see
why
itd
be
good
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
is
like
aged
but
i
guess
i
will
until
next
year
not
my
favorite
style
as
it
is
too
sweet
for
me
most
of
the
time
but
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
good
one
for
a
late
evening
sipper
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barley
wine
but
a
little
disjointed
fresh
it
would
do
better
in
the
bottle
with
some
age
on
it
but
if
you
are
able
to
try
it
on
tap
you
should
its
a
great
barley
wine
cheers
final
thought
try
this
one
great
price
at
2
a
pop
and
8
8
abv
awesome
beer
some
people
in
the
us
may
laugh
at
the
notion
but
this
beer
has
been
one
of
my
socalled
whales
for
a
long
time
i
had
yet
to
find
it
in
canada
anywhere
and
still
have
yet
to
see
it
in
bottles
alas
beer
revolution
here
in
cowtown
snagged
a
keg
and
i
essentially
teleported
down
there
to
sample
a
12
oz
goblet
a
unique
brick
red
shading
into
brown
hue
that
recalls
autumn
leaves
uh
oh
finding
this
brew
has
brought
out
my
whimsical
artsy
side
with
some
light
tan
bubbles
draped
over
the
matte
bronze
very
hop
forward
aroma
with
rich
toffee
orchard
fruit
cut
flowers
and
pine
resins
intermingling
but
not
clashing
palate
features
licorice
toffee
molasses
leather
candy
apple
burnt
pancakes
port
wine
pine
and
hazelnuts
with
a
lemonlime
hop
garnish
that
becomes
more
perceptible
as
your
palate
habituates
to
the
malts
yeast
esters
galore
and
overall
features
a
complex
and
robust
yet
refined
flavor
profile
less
intense
than
many
socalled
american
barley
wines
but
still
hoppy
and
vibrant
i
get
the
english
designation
but
the
hops
are
american
in
my
book
less
thick
than
many
other
barley
wines
quite
smooth
on
the
mouth
but
finishes
rather
bitter
medicinal
and
woody
although
allegedly
this
brew
has
changed
over
the
years
it
still
tastes
like
a
true
classic
to
me
with
any
luck
well
get
bottles
in
this
province
i
have
to
say
coming
to
craft
beer
at
this
relatively
late
stage
in
my
life
has
made
the
whole
ride
quite
fun
read
about
the
iconic
beers
wait
for
them
to
show
up
in
this
market
rejoice
when
they
finally
do
o
this
is
my
first
taste
of
this
style
its
pretty
interesting
the
only
negative
with
this
brew
is
that
it
is
expensive
around
here
around
3
a
bottle
overall
fantastic
beer
have
this
with
a
beauty
of
a
blue
cheese
for
dessert
or
all
on
its
own
and
enjoy
the
changing
complexity
of
the
beer
with
its
long
ever
changing
finish
that
goes
from
nuts
to
dried
fruit
to
baking
spices
o
wow
this
beer
is
underrated
its
by
far
my
favorite
beer
from
anchor
that
said
i
have
yet
to
try
their
barrel
aged
beer
overall
could
be
better
especially
with
some
oxidation
more
bitterness
would
help
too
but
only
if
it
accentuated
the
existing
flavors
which
are
promising
ill
have
another
bottle
soon
but
then
let
it
sit
for
a
few
months
and
try
it
again
tasty
barleywine
sweeter
than
most
which
lets
the
malt
get
its
full
billing
great
evening
sipper
very
tasty
desert
beer
wish
they
would
bump
up
the
hops
a
touch
overall
i
really
like
this
barleywine
i
think
i
prefer
american
versions
with
their
higher
hop
levels
than
the
english
kind
such
as
this
but
this
is
an
excellent
brew
and
id
have
it
again
i
think
it
would
be
wonderful
with
a
cigar
or
pipe
sipping
slowly
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
tan
head
aroma
of
malt
and
barley
bit
of
citrus
and
fruity
there
is
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
of
malt
and
barley
with
some
caramel
sweetness
fruity
with
a
bit
of
citrus
mild
bitterness
and
a
clean
finish
has
a
moderate
body
smooth
with
no
real
hint
of
the
8
8
abv
very
well
balanced
great
sipper
to
kick
back
and
relax
with
a
sweet
fruity
barley
wine
very
complex
worth
trying
high
c
cold
low
b
at
room
temperature
i
just
dont
think
ill
be
going
back
to
this
which
is
sad
because
it
was
one
of
my
favorites
i
was
excited
to
see
it
but
the
thrill
is
gone
luckily
there
are
many
more
out
there
to
try
overall
a
nice
readilyavailable
barleywine
nice
for
sipping
as
dessert
or
for
warming
up
on
a
cold
night
this
is
my
first
experience
with
old
foghorn
and
it
has
exceeded
all
of
my
expectations
to
varying
degrees
it
hits
all
the
notes
i
like
in
an
english
barleywine
seeing
as
this
bottle
is
over
3
years
old
apparently
this
also
ages
like
a
champ
ill
need
grab
a
six
pack
this
winter
to
try
some
fresh
if
i
dont
like
it
fresh
i
at
least
know
ill
like
it
later
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
fair
head
and
some
slight
yet
persistent
lacing
nose
is
candied
roasted
malts
earthy
combo
of
caramel
pecan
and
roasted
malt
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
a
good
barleywine
while
not
my
favorite
certainly
worth
a
try
o
really
enjoyed
this
brew
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barely
wines
ive
had
with
out
losing
its
complexity
lots
of
really
nice
tastes
in
this
one
that
almost
changes
sip
to
sip
try
it
out
great
carbonation
and
body
again
super
refreshing
this
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
there
is
a
lot
of
malted
barley
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
very
bold
with
a
heavy
barley
flavor
that
delivers
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
in
end
a
lot
of
barley
wines
drink
very
similar
to
an
iipa
but
this
one
has
a
much
different
characteristic
overall
definitely
a
quality
brew
and
easily
surprised
me
if
i
see
the
bottle
at
my
local
spot
i
would
definitely
love
to
grab
again
hope
you
all
have
a
enjoyed
as
much
as
i
did
salud
o
i
love
this
beer
i
love
barleywines
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
definitely
my
favorite
that
comes
in
under
10
so
rich
and
full
the
balance
is
nice
steady
as
she
goes
awesome
definitely
not
my
favorite
barleywine
even
of
the
english
blood
this
one
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
fruity
more
like
a
jammy
desert
than
a
beer
but
it
is
still
expertly
crafted
i
just
personally
dont
care
a
whole
lot
for
the
flavor
especially
compared
to
other
anchor
brews
a
little
haze
to
the
deep
amber
bodied
liquid
an
inch
of
tan
head
dies
in
a
minute
or
so
and
a
still
intimidating
glass
remains
aromatics
of
dried
apples
fresh
apples
and
a
certain
nutty
vibe
underneath
english
ale
yeast
molasses
notes
on
the
flavor
with
a
whole
truckload
of
grain
thick
an
sticky
sweet
the
apples
are
there
too
on
the
first
half
and
as
i
wait
and
wait
for
the
dry
hopping
the
label
tells
me
to
expect
it
never
comes
sweetness
is
never
cut
by
hops
and
the
aftertaste
is
real
odd
as
a
result
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
enough
but
this
is
a
dense
brew
that
demands
persistence
and
patience
i
like
the
carbonation
and
i
like
the
body
i
just
dont
really
care
for
the
taste
well
made
though
and
sturdy
for
anchor
fall
would
be
its
most
appropriate
season
the
smoothness
of
the
dried
fruit
certainly
comes
to
light
in
the
feel
despite
the
overwhelming
carbonation
that
fizzled
away
the
feel
is
slightly
thick
and
nicely
smooth
this
is
a
really
cool
drink
i
recommend
it
highly
i
know
this
review
is
getting
dinged
for
appearance
what
can
i
say
the
fizzy
ring
is
gone
and
now
it
looks
like
a
glass
of
mahogany
water
ooh
but
it
is
so
delightful
and
im
glad
the
carbonation
is
locked
in
there
somehow
making
it
continue
to
be
very
drinkable
it
is
losing
some
of
the
fizzy
impact
well
1020
minutes
have
gone
by
sip
keep
on
sipping
keep
on
sipping
keep
on
sipping
keep
on
sipping
i
recommend
this
tastes
so
alcoholic
youd
think
it
was
stronger
the
bottle
seems
ok
this
must
be
the
way
they
like
it
maybe
the
monk
who
copied
this
recipe
onto
vellum
made
a
mistake
somewhere
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
san
diego
what
can
i
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
recently
i
never
had
a
barely
wine
before
in
my
life
and
i
was
amazed
how
good
they
are
this
fits
perfectly
for
an
after
dinner
desert
type
beer
it
is
almost
like
wine
but
so
much
better
i
could
go
on
and
on
but
you
really
have
to
try
it
i
am
slightly
disappointed
that
it
is
hard
to
get
where
i
live
in
pa
one
of
my
local
bars
had
it
but
they
stopped
getting
it
sadly
overall
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
barleywine
i
didnt
have
really
high
expectations
for
this
beer
but
it
was
very
good
especially
considering
the
bottle
i
got
was
packaged
in
2011
this
one
truly
stands
up
over
time
and
i
need
to
try
one
thats
a
little
fresher
soon
o
not
bad
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
for
a
barleywine
the
sweetness
and
spice
all
taste
a
bit
odd
its
not
super
sweet
but
like
a
sticky
spicy
not
hot
sweetness
this
is
a
curious
beer
its
supposedly
about
8
abv
but
it
drinks
more
like
a
dessert
wine
with
twice
the
booze
it
has
some
nice
depth
but
its
a
bit
heavy
on
the
caramel
and
the
booze
it
tastes
a
little
young
maybe
it
would
get
better
with
age
massive
alcohol
content
the
beer
was
very
complex
in
both
smell
and
taste
with
plenty
of
sweet
malts
and
fruits
featuring
a
lot
more
hoppy
than
id
expected
which
was
a
big
surprise
and
a
most
welcome
one
one
ill
look
to
pick
up
again
i
think
im
glad
i
revisited
this
one
its
been
awhile
old
foghorn
brought
the
style
back
in
the
70s
and
it
still
holds
up
with
the
many
options
on
shelves
today
this
will
age
amazingly
an
enjoyable
barleywine
expectations
from
a
very
old
representative
of
a
style
shattered
poured
the
beer
in
a
big
wineglass
very
big
head
and
a
dark
copper
coloured
fluid
great
smell
with
sweetness
in
it
little
lacing
in
the
glass
this
is
a
very
nice
barley
wine
styled
beer
loved
every
sip
of
it
good
carbonation
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
the
big
fruitiness
to
hold
against
the
booze
and
big
malty
base
this
added
a
unique
twist
and
additional
sweetness
especially
with
that
emphasis
on
banana
and
pear
that
said
things
remained
sweet
and
borderline
cloying
throughout
slowing
the
drinking
down
otherwise
this
was
a
warming
and
inviting
beer
and
something
certainly
worth
the
try
if
you
like
the
style
or
something
on
the
sweeter
side
overall
it
still
has
some
years
in
it
i
think
held
up
well
so
far
good
esters
though
they
do
overpower
the
malt
complexity
a
bit
poured
into
a
snifter
the
beer
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
very
slight
head
it
showed
lacing
and
noticeable
lacing
in
the
glass
in
the
initial
taste
one
notices
a
sweet
alcohol
taste
one
detects
notes
of
honey
caramel
cinnamon
and
raisin
there
is
a
spice
to
the
barleywine
that
is
characteristic
of
cinnamon
in
the
background
the
hope
are
detectable
before
being
smoothed
by
the
malts
a
pleasant
warming
sensation
tickles
the
belly
on
a
cold
winter
night
the
mouthfeel
allows
the
warmth
to
linger
i
forgot
how
much
i
liked
this
easily
accessible
barleywine
that
sweetens
in
time
delicious
a
solid
beer
for
sure
not
entirely
convinced
that
age
harmed
this
one
too
much
but
its
not
as
vigorous
and
satiating
as
the
experiences
ive
had
ordering
a
fresh
bottle
of
old
foghorn
at
my
local
beer
bar
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
well
balanced
with
some
nice
fruit
tastes
this
beer
pours
up
a
cloudy
apricot
color
and
might
be
mistook
for
apple
juice
if
it
wasnt
so
cloudy
there
is
not
much
head
retention
or
lacing
the
nose
is
barley
yeast
and
alcohol
taste
is
bitter
on
the
front
giving
way
to
a
syrupy
applelike
sweetness
on
the
finish
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
warming
on
the
finish
becomes
more
prominent
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
syrup
like
not
a
fan
of
this
one
but
it
is
drinkable
overall
this
is
alright
but
not
as
interesting
as
others
in
the
style
the
lighter
and
drier
feel
seemed
out
of
place
for
a
barleywine
as
well
id
like
to
see
a
bigger
oilier
feel
on
this
one
which
would
also
help
support
the
flavors
and
a
bolder
nose
to
help
showcase
the
malt
aromas
decent
stuff
though
not
memorable
o
nice
barleywine
not
the
best
ive
had
though
this
pours
a
malty
amber
color
with
nice
foam
there
is
a
malty
caramel
coconut
aroma
on
this
and
a
flavor
full
of
thick
malty
piney
sweetness
i
get
a
real
pleasing
taste
of
orange
marmalade
and
some
toasted
coconut
that
results
in
something
sweet
mellow
and
lightly
bodied
for
such
a
big
beer
the
hops
dont
dominant
balanced
out
by
the
rich
maltiness
a
classic
barleywine
o
a
very
solid
english
barleywine
with
plenty
of
flavor
without
an
overload
of
booze
perfectly
balanced
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
the
fact
that
this
was
one
of
the
first
postprohibition
era
barleywinestyle
ales
is
impressive
i
tried
the
2009
version
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
has
a
copper
hue
it
is
slightly
cloudy
medium
amount
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
not
very
much
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
with
some
peach
apricot
and
plum
not
much
floral
or
herbal
notes
from
the
hops
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
honey
and
lots
of
malt
coming
through
but
not
much
hops
overall
it
tastes
like
what
i
would
expect
for
a
barleywine
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
as
i
would
expect
very
little
carbonation
this
beer
takes
me
back
to
my
first
craft
beer
experiences
in
the
1980s
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
o
lately
barleywines
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
ranked
right
up
there
amongst
my
favorites
however
i
have
many
more
to
try
the
price
is
a
bit
high
but
as
a
trade
off
its
nice
to
see
a
beer
of
this
style
and
strength
still
available
in
a
six
pack
this
beer
has
been
around
for
a
long
time
and
according
to
anchor
was
the
great
grandaddy
of
the
american
barleywines
i
like
the
fact
that
the
brewer
uses
the
unique
dating
system
so
we
know
the
bottling
date
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
with
friends
on
a
cool
evening
reflecting
on
old
times
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
mahogany
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
molasses
taste
is
good
fruits
malts
sweet
a
touch
of
alcohol
complex
and
flavorful
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
fine
quality
beer
overall
a
tasty
barleywine
that
id
certainly
try
again
would
love
to
let
this
one
age
for
a
year
or
two
and
let
it
cool
off
o
sweet
barleywine
with
a
nice
scent
i
will
have
to
get
a
bottle
to
keep
on
hand
in
my
cellar
overall
sweet
with
the
booze
well
hidden
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
d
an
interesting
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
kind
of
flat
drinkable
but
lacking
when
compared
to
more
modern
examples
of
the
style
overall
maybe
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
for
my
taste
a
solid
barley
wine
with
herbs
and
nice
medicinal
qualities
though
this
beer
is
good
all
around
but
its
even
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
everything
about
it
works
so
well
together
very
much
on
the
sweet
side
of
the
barleywine
world
balanced
more
by
alcohol
bite
than
by
hops
but
im
digging
it
and
i
have
a
hard
time
thinking
of
a
readilyavailable
barleywine
i
like
more
sure
to
become
a
staple
for
me
full
bodied
very
lightly
effervescent
just
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
warming
from
the
nose
on
this
is
a
seriously
big
sipping
style
beer
drinking
it
like
brandy
is
probably
the
best
way
to
enjoy
this
i
once
drank
2
liters
of
it
over
a
few
hours
and
paid
the
price
for
not
respecting

for

what
it
is
nice

english
barley
wine
o
a
nice
nofrills
barleywine
that
favors
drinkability
and
approachability
over
extreme
boldness
and
shouty
expressiveness
it
doesnt
rewrite
the
book
nor
does
it
try
to
rewrite
the
book
an
excellent
choice
for
someone
whos
never
had
a
barleywine
before
and
its
drinkable
nature
makes
it
one
of
the
few
barleywines
that
i
could
have
multiple
servings
of
for
some
reason
this
beer
has
been
pretty
elusive
for
me
either
that
or
i
havent
been
looking
hard
enough
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
wine
glass
nice
cola
color
and
a
decent
head
for
me
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
was
worth
the
wait
to
find
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
looks
and
smells
good
taste
of
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
but
otherwise
this
is
a
great
beer
o
ill
have
this
over

may
have
helped
as
well
o
this
is
a
nice
barley
wine
and
is
good
for
a
beginner
barley
wine
drinker
however
there
are
better
examples
out
there
measy
drinking
for
a
barley
wine
not
much
carbonation
i
could
put
quite
a
few
of
these
away
quick
bc
its
strangely
refreshing
for
a
bw
t
lots
of
dark
fruits
mostly
raisin
and
fig
upfront
some
bready
malts
brown
sugar
honey
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
booze
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
beer
really
coats
your
mouth
making
it
a
sipper
for
sure
a
really
approachable
barleywine
im
a
fan
o
a
solid
english
bw
and
quite
enjoyable
though
malty
sweet
beers
arent
my
favorite
overall
a
really
good
solid
version
of
the
style
taste
is
powerful
and
potent
up
front
touches
of
sweetness
and
heavy
malts
obscure
the
alcohol
content
even
the
hops
content
is
relaxed
and
smooth
here
world
class
12oz

at
mckinnons

pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
good
inch
or
so
of
khakicolored
rocky
and
persistent
head
smells
fruity
particularly
banana
and

with
toffee
and
boozy
notes
in
the
background
ripe
bananas
dates
oranges
with
strong
chocolate
and
toffee
notes
and
an
undertone
of
booze
a
sipper
but
the
best
kind
it
disappears
way
too
quickly
delicious
spoton
o
despite
its
quite
strong
hop
presence
at
least
for
the
style
this
is
very
much
a
sweet
beer
and
maybe
even
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
has
the
strong
fullflavoured
character
of
a
good
barleywine
though
maybe
it
lacks
a
bit
in
terms
of
balance
and
drinkabilty
still
a
good
solid
beer
strong
fruity
aroma
is
rather
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
has
an
overtone
of
molasses
plus
a
firm
hint
of
honey
it
pours
a
beautiful
clear
mahoganycopper
with
a
thick
fluffy
pale
coppertan
head
that
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
sweet
fruity
flavor
has
tones
of
honey
and
caramel
as
well
as
a
noticeable
if
not
fierce
alcohol
bite
that
nicely
offsets
the
sweetness
texture
has
good
body
and
an
ok
amount
of
fizz
sound
the
foghorn
and
pour
this
one
down
the
hatch
o
a
very
well
made
barley
wine
old
school
and
drinkable
with
the
slightly
lower
alcohol
content
for
the
style
id
love
to
have
this
again
but
ive
already
had
some
fantastic
brews
plus
coffee
tonight
so
this
review
might
be
bias
3
75
a
single
o
pretty
solid
offering
i
got
this
as
an
extra
and
im
glad
i
did
really
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
since
its
labeled
as
the
original
american
barleywine
its
worth
a
try
overall
a
rich
solid
no
missteps
time
has
been
very
good
the
butterscotch
finish
is
amazing
very
yeasty
dry
fruit
mixed
with
syrupy
textured
toasted
mlats
wet
toast
bread
crust
and
dried
fruit
powder
strawberries
and
plums
sipping
is
noce
with
this
barleywine
no
detectable
heat
from
the
abv
but
you
know
its
there
its
nice
to
know
i
can
get
this
barley
wine
all
year
round
o
not
real
wild
about
the
flavor
and
would
prefer
the
more
piney
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
glad
i
tried
this
though
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
dark
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
the
smell
of
sweet
roasted
malt
dominates
there
alcohol
is
present
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
up
front
is
sweet
from
the
abundant
malt
there
are
also
some
notes
of
raisin
spice
and
i
can
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
but
its
not
a
very
strong
flavor
its
full
bodied
but
still
crisp
due
to
the
carbonation
its
a
sipper
but
a
very
pleasing
sipper
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
english
style
barleywine
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
and
its
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
the
anchor
catalog
pours
a
dark
honey
color
bordering
on
burnt
orange
with
ruby
highlights
and
an
ample
tan
head
to
match
the
aroma
is
a
pleasing
combination
of
sweet
malt
and
crisp
hop
working
in
harmony
the
flavors
here
are
huge
and
unabashed
a
sweet
toasted
almost
bocklike
malt
lays
the
foundation
brown
sugar
comes
to
mind
this
is
accompanied
by
just
enough
hop
flavor
to
keep
the
sweetness
from
getting
out
of
control
raisin
is
easily
ascertainable
nutty
flavors
are
also
present
as
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
that
manages
to
sneak
through
the
boozy
fog
that
asserts
itself
on
the
back
end
along
with
a
more
noticeable
hop
bitterness
another
reviewer
noted
cinammon
and
while
i
wouldnt
have
identified
it
myself
i
can
recognize
it
in
retrospect
theres
more
than
enough
going
on
here
to
keep
your
tastebuds
interested
for
the
entire
glass
the
alcoholic
taste
may
be
a
little
abrasive
for
some
but
it
doesnt
seem
out
of
place
amidst
the
other
bold
flavors
i
have
neglible
experience
with
barleywines
but
i
like
what
im
seeing
here
from
anchor
id
go
so
far
as
to
say
this
is
one
of
their
best
brews
easily
better
than
their
more
widely
acclaimed
offerings
definitely
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
o
im
not
sure
if
its
like
this
fresh
or
if
its
the
aging
but
this
bottle
was
very
smooth
and
moderate
to
style
tasty
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
with
a
very
thick
heavy
body
and
flavors
of
honey
dark
cherries
figs
and
a
peppery
alcohol
heat
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
and
fine
bubbles
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
hints
of
honey
dough
barley
and
light
hops
the
palate
is
full
with
a
rich
honeyed
texture
and
nuances
of
dusty
grain
golden
raisin
and
yeast
the
finish
is
nice
and
light
on
the
palate
nicely
done
overall
a
decent
beer
but
in
the
end
good
for
no
more
than
sipping
on
and
to
me
thats
not
a
good
quality
in
a
beer
o
a
uniquely
flavoured
barleywine
with
the
greenyleafy
notes
adding
a
new
twist
to
the
traditional
style
im
used
to
abv
is
nicely
hidden
and
offers
only
a
bit
of
heat
and
sweetness
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
though
not
my
favourite
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
o
overall
i
enjoyed
htis
there
are
a
lot
of
different
flavors
going
on
here
but
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
it
after
dinner
overall
why
in
the
heck
have
i
never
had
this
barleywine
before
its
great
o
im
struggling
to
get
through
7
oz
of
this
beer
at
16
years
old
it
does
have
some
redeeming
qualities
lots
of
robust
barley
wine
aromas
and
tastes
this
beer
aged
well
o
a
nice
barleywine
but
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
notes
the
bittering
on
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
has
an
incredible
softness
very
deft
smooth
rich
elegant
mellow
and
subtle
complexity
could
be
a
bit
more
for
me
but
whats
there
is
really
well
done
odecent
but
not
great
a
good
value
though
o
a
good
sipper
different
from
the
rest
of
the
barleywines
on
the
local
store
shelves
worth
a
try
overall
a
solid
english
style
barley
wine
very
subtle
in
the
nose
and
taste
with
light
alcohol
and
fine
finish
for
those
of
you
that
think
im
rating
this
beer
harshly
please
remember
that
im
comparing
it
to
other
examples
of
the
style
of
which
i
feel
this
is
average
at
best
oexpected
better
from
anchor
the
beer
has
some
redeeming
qualities
i
believe
this
on
was
aged
a
while
so
hopefully
fresh
the
beer
tastes
better
overall
little
bit
of
a
boring
barleywine
but
certainly
worth
giving
a
try
malty
very
malty
quite
smooth
rich
treacle
molasses
banana
and
quite
dry
with
a
dried
fruit
and
brown
sugary
end
left
a
couple
of
gulps
in
the
glass
and
came
back
to
it
a
couple
of
hours
later
and
having
warmed
up
displayed
an
aged
sherry
barrel
aged
malt
whisky
element
the
alcohol
is
a
slow
creeper
as
well
pours
hazy
reddish
brown
are
there
supposed
to
be
particles
of
something
in
this
thin
brownish
foam
dissapears
very
quickly
leaving
an
oily
film
taste
is
unusual
i
can
see
why
they
recommend
sipping
you
do
not
want
to
just
slug
this
back
the
taste
definately
improves
as
it
warms
highly
alchoholic
i
can
see
now
the
resemblence
to
wine
i
might
try
it
again
but
the
stuff
floating
around
in
it
is
a
bit
offputting
o
a
fantastic
english
barley
wine
that
delivers
full
force
flavors
that
create
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
brew
i
personally
prefer
a
bit
more
hops
but
for
the
style
it
is
top
notch
the
price
is
a
big
downer
because
i
can
find
many
different
beers
that
are
as
good
or
better
for
less
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
barley
wine
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
o
great
beer
i
plan
on
buying
every
year
and
in
about
four
or
five
years
ill
do
a
vertical
overall
not
a
bad
barleywine
although
but
there
are
definitely
better
choices
out
there
for
a
little
bit
more
cash
overall
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
do
not
have
much
experience
with
barleywines
having
said
that
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
plan
to
have
it
again
there
is
a
complexity
to
this
style
i
was
not
expecting
this
is
probably
the
most
well
made
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
anchor
classic
looking
anchor
bottle
poured
into
a
12oz
mason
jar
burnt
ruby
red
color
clean
with
a
khaki
fine
tight
head
just
something
about
looking
at
a
fine
beer
in
a
mason
jar
big
dark
fruits
in
the
nose
is
suprising
plum
fig
caramel
booze
oak
touch
of
vanilla
and
of
course
a
noticeable
spice
hop
presence
taste
holds
true
to
the
nose
but
very
impressed
with
the
balance
in
this
one
the
spicey
hop
character
melds
so
well
with
the
dark
fruits
caramel
sweetness
crazy
smooth
this
is
one
to
revisit
for
sure
highly
recommended
this
beer
actually
reminds
me
more
of
some
of
the
better
old
ales
i
have
had
rather
than
a
barleywine
that
may
come
form
the
fact
that
this
is
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
the
american
renditions
of
the
barleywine
old
foghorn
is
flavorful
drinkable
and
an
excellent
beer
o
a
great
sipper
im
impressed
at
how
mellow
and
well
integrated
this
is
showcases
each
flavor
well
without
any
dominating
superb
example
of
the
style
overall
im
hooked
on
this
style
and
will
pursue
the
bottled
variety
old
foghorn
is
a
great
english
barleywine
just
sweet
enough
to
have
me
heading
toward
the
lighthouse
i
love
anchor
steam
now
theyve
impressed
me
again
recommended
a
rock
solid
english
style
and
one
of
the
best
drinking
ones
ive
ever
had
would
not
be
afraid
to
revisit
this
at
all
possibly
my
favorite
from
anchor
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
and
the
boozy
finish
makes
it
good
for
a
cold
winter
evening
i
see
this
as
a
special
occasion
beer
not
as
something
id
regularly
purchase
though
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
and
after
rereading
what
an
english
barley
should
test
like
i
have
to
say
im
happy
i
bought
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
standard
barleywine
if
you
have
high
standards
strong
and
tasty
warming
for
the
winter
months
and
a
fine
companion
overall
a
very
well
balanced
barleywine
and
a
benchmark
for
the
style
appearance
has
a
dark
ruby
color
i
couldnt
really
smell
hops
or
any
other
distinct
aroma
taste
has
a
malty
character
with
hint
of
english
style
barleywine
sweetness
the
closest
youll
get
this
english
style
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
be
happy
to
buy
more
o
this
is
tasty
the
appearancearomas
are
a
bit
below
what
id
expect
but
as
soon
as
it
hits
your
lips
youre
in
for
a
treat
as
others
have
said
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
o
pretty
good
barleywine
pretty
sweet
overall
bit
not
difficult
to
drink
would
recommend
o
good
beer
anchor
steam
quality
but
drinkability
is
compromised
by
the
high
abv
combined
with
its
high
sweetness
old
foghorn
is
an
excellent
english
barleywine
im
really
impressed
its
a
very
flavorful
wellbalanced
approachable
beer
i
suspect
that
the
past
year
has
refined
it
a
little
the
hop
flavor
may
have
subsided
a
little
but
theres
still
a
bit
there
all
of
the
flavors
are
nicely
integrated
and
well
done
very
good
stuff
find
a
bottle
of
this
one
its
a
classic
orates
above
average
interested
to
see
how
this
one
ages
in
5
and
10
years
a
nice
example
of
a
readily
available
english
barleywine
after
about
a
year
of
aging
i
dont
know
that
i
see
a
whole
lot
of
benefit
though
this
is
a
nice
mild
barleywine
not
to
over
the
top
but
still
pretty
solid
the
beer
is
really
good
most
barleywines
leave
you
with
that
i
cant
stand
to
drink
too
much
of
this
but
this
one
doesnt
its
not
filling
and
the
subtle
aftertaste
makes
it
a
refreshing
change
from
the
norm
i
really
like
it
anchor
steam
you
have
done
it
again
bottoms
up
people
o
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
because
it
is
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
mostly
hidden
from
the
taste
a
fan
of
barleywines
this
is
just
too
over
the
top
sweet
and
medicinal
for
me
overall
im
pretty
impressed
if
theres
such
a
thing
as
a
sessionable
barleywine
it
might
be
this
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
overall
i
was
expecting
to
like
this
a
good
deal
more
than
i
did
the
sweetness
seemed
excessive
and
was
not
countered
by
anything
else
that
might
have
resulted
in
a
more
interesting
interplay
overall
a
nice
well
rounded
and
balanced
barley
wine
im
not
sure
how
old
my
bottle
was
but
it
tasted
smooth
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
of
a
butter
tart
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
one
again
and
would
love
to
keep
a
few
in
my
cellar
thanks
ian
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
too
hot
too
fruity
wierd
carbonation
itd
prolly
be
better
colder
rather
than
cellar
temp
and
definatly
could
use
some
age
but
i
cant
really
see
this
turning
into
a
good
beer
no
matter
how
much
age
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
bottled
on
dec
2009
this
pours
a
yeast
filled
thick
tea
color
with
a
decent
tan
colored
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
is
very
malt
heavy
with
lots
of
toffee
and
some
caramel
the
feel
is
medium
to
thick
the
taste
is
as
it
smells
this
is
older
the
hops
have
faded
and
its
almost
all
sweet
thick
malts
good
stuff
oi
really
liked
this
beer
it
went
down
pretty
easy
almost
too
easy
for
a
barleywine
paired
with
the
right
food
or
wine
this
could
be
exceptional
i
still
prefer
the
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
and
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
one
but
id
sure
as
hell
never
refuse
one
smells
amazing
taste
pretty
decent
paired
with
gruyere
and
danish
bleu
cheeses
the
creaminess
of
the
cheeses
mellow
out
the
finish
a
bit
definitely
subdues
the
midas
touchiness
that
i
dont
like
mmm
pairs
super
well
old
foghorn
is
a
solid
beer
just
like
most
things
that
come
from
anchor
dthis
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
beer
it
finishes
with
a
crisp
bitterness
that
has
you
coming
back
for
more
for
being
over
a
year
old
im
pretty
surprised
how
the
hop
profiles
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
have
held
up
moreys
bottom
line
if
you
prefer
your
barleywines
on
the
less
hoppy
side
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
pick
up
my
only
critique
is
that
it
is
a
bit
medicinal
i
honestly
dont
mind
it
very
much
though
its
still
a
fun
beer
to
sip
on
a
good
nightcap
overall
i
love
barleywine
and
this
one
is
included
it
is
a
great
ale
that
i
am
happy
i
picked
up
a
few
packs
of
good
job
again
anchor
on
this
batch
of
11
foghorn
o
i
will
revisit
this
sooner
than
later
o
this
is
a
well
done
if
slightly
boozy
barleywine
certainly
worth
a
shot
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
one
will
do
you
at
8
abv
i
liked
this
one
not
as
much
alcohol
burn
as
im
used
to
with
most
barleywines
worth
looking
for
conclusion
is
this
what
all
of
these
are
like
wowie
i
didnt
expect
to
get
slapped
with
this
type
of
cloying
craziness
i
love
myself
a
maltbomb
from
time
to
time
but
this
is
takes
that
idea
a
little
far
this
isnt
bad
but
it
is
on
the
edge
which
i
do
admire
i
love
the
flavors
especially
the
crazy
candycaramel
i
just
wish
the
attenuation
was
a
little
higher
so
that
it
went
down
easier
than
maple
syrup
i
would
say
that
all
should
try
this
beer
if
only
for
the
sake
of
further
defining
ones
personal
tastes
considering
extremely
malty
concoctions
this
is
a
nice
beer
the
malt
fruit
and
hop
character
creates
a
relatively
complex
ale
which
is
perfectly
tasty
but
it
lacks
the
overall
depth
and
malt
complexity
of
an
english
barleywine
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
alcohol
and
some
dark
fruit
in
the
taste
sweet
alcohol
dark
fruits
especially
plum
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
dark
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
mellow
and
easy
for
a
barleywine
but
it
is
enjoyable
o
not
my
favorite
english
style
barleywine
but
certainly
a
good
brew
not
an
overly
complex
beer
would
like
to
give
it
some
cellar
time
and
see
how
it
evolves
over
time
o
theres
a
bit
of
sting
from
the
heat
which
detracts
from
overall
enjoyment
its
especially
noticeable
considering
the
relatively
low
abv
however
this
is
a
real
asskicker
of
a
beer
i
think
anyone
moving
into
the
craft
beer
scene
but
familiar
with
wine
and
liquor
ought
to
be
introduced
to
this
one
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
accessible
barleywine
personally
im
a
fan
of
hoppier
american
takes
on
the
style
but
i
can
hardly
mark
this
fine
beer
down
for
representing
the
traditional
take
of
this
style
this
brew
had
all
the
nice
qualities
you
would
expect
in
a
good
english
barleywine
it
even
seemed
slightly
more
drinkable
than
others
that
ive
had
overall
i
am
glad
i
ran
into
this
one
you
can
be
sure
ill
have
one
laid
down
in
my
cellar
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
english
barley
wine
old
foghorn
is
a
tasty
barley
wine
but
not
quite
in
the
upper
echelon
it
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
though
and
will
not
disappoint
o
i
like
havent
had
this
in
years
oddly
enough
clearly
drinks
more
like
an
english
barleywine
or
an
old
ale
than
an
american
barleywine
but
im
ok
with
that
notes
a
spoton
representation
of
the
style
tastes
good
now
but
would
probably
benefit
from
some
extended
aging
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
offering
a
pronounced
yeast
influence
on
the
final
product
i
would
guess
that
the
same
yeast
used
in
their
porter
likely
of
englishburton
origin
is
used
in
old
foghorn
as
well
overall
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
tried
the
aroma
is
perfect
and
the
rest
of
the
characteristics
are
solid
as
well
a
great
offering
from
anchor
brewing
give
it
a
try
definitely
correctly
labeled
as
english
not
the
american
triple
ipa
take
on
the
style
overall
i
was
a
little
scared
by
this
brew
my
first
barley
wine
and
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
lot
worse
than
this
however
the
alcohol
is
not
inappropriate
in
fact
the
beer
needs
it
i
should
not
have
doubted
anchor
i
have
liked
everything
of
theirs
so
far
and
now
i
am
definitely
more
curious
to
try
different
barley
wines
o
a
kind
of
unbalanced
barleywine
some
parts
are
great
while
others
are
not
a
pretty
solid
offering
overall
although
at
first
this
beer
is
disappointing
initially
really
benefits
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
flavors
come
out
more
overly
active
carbonation
subsides
a
little
not
bad
but
not
a
great
barleywine
again
probably
the
most
drinkable
barley
ive
had
you
can
probably
stand
to
do
2
maybe
even
three
d
not
disappointed
at
all
in
this
as
you
drink
it
actually
gets
a
little
more
complex
and
all
the
layers
of
flavor
come
out
to
play
take
this
one
slowly
overall
a
good
beer
this
beer
pours
a
thick
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
figs
and
chocolate
and
some
hints
of
alcohol
the
taste
starts
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
and
then
finishes
with
a
burn
of
alcohol
slightly
more
than
i
would
like
the
mouthfeel
isnt
overcarbed
but
finishes
slightly
watery
overall
a
decent
barleywine
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
smells
of
grapes
orange
more
fruit
and
smells
very
sweet
taste
is
concord
grapes
up
front
followed
by
orange
and
sweet
citrus
not
much
punch
smooth
but
its
too
light
alcohol
is
overly
noticeable
it
doesnt
balance
very
well
with
the
other
flavors
finish
lingers
though
which
is
nice
tastes
of
concord
grapes
once
again
mouthfeel
is
thin
a
bit
creamy
but
not
very
this
isnt
anything
special
at
all
i
love
barleywines
because
most
of
them
are
sippers
and
heavy
this
is
the
opposite
of
that
many
flavors
that
can
be
detected
but
in
bulk
there
are
macerated
fruits
including
grapes
perhaps
some
malts
that
offers
a
little
caramel
on
the
nose
but
also
slightly
citric
hops
on
the
edge
of
oldfashioned
the
touch
of
alcohol
is
also
felt
in
the
mouth
dark
rum
but
also
above
all
discreet
toffee
and
lemon
finish
in
the
same
vein
mixture
of
many
tastes
and
good
power
for
only
8
8
but
behind
all
these
interesting
flavors
there
may
be
an
impression
of
the
drink
too
much
because
although
very
nice
sometimes
to
the
verge
of
nausea
all
in
all
a
rather
underwhelming
barley
wine
overly
sweet
and
insufficiently
hopped
with
a
thinner
mouthfeel
than
one
would
expect
id
look
for
another
barleywine
particularly
given
all
the
other
truly
phenomenal
examples
out
there
o
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
barleywine
i
would
probably
use
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
its
not
necessarily
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
o
this
is
quite
the
underrated
barley
wine
in
a
craft
beer
market
saturated
with
extreme
brews
i
can
see
this
beer
aging
well
mouthfeel
a
good
level
of
carbonation
but
the
consistency
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
barleywine
fuller
medium
body
softer
carbonation
pretty
smooth
on
the
tongue
while
drinking
pretty
tasty
barleywine
not
necessarily
at
the
top
but
something
id
drink
again
poured
redish
brown
from
a
12oz
bottle
thin
white
head
with
spotty
lacing
smells
of
caramel
and
spices
well
balanced
mouthfeel
and
taste
spices
and
sweetness
up
front
with
a
slight
fruity
caramel
finish
not
overly
sweet
like
many
barleywines
alcohol
taste
is
well
hidden
overall
this
is
a
well
rounded
barleywine
which
i
will
get
again
o
not
a
fan
of
barleywines
but
of
the
ones
ive
had
i
think
i
like
this
the
least
overall
a
nice
mellow
version
of
a
barleywine
nothing
too
amazing
here
imo
but
it
isnt
too
aggressive
abrasive
or
alcoholic
o
very
nice
light
taste
bright
flavors
are
a
good
take
on
the
style
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
deep
reddish
tint
to
it
and
a
thin
head
which
leaves
almost
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
along
with
a
dark
fruit
and
green
fruit
aromas
green
apples
and
grapes
plum
and
raisins
no
real
hop
aroma
to
find
the
taste
has
a
big
flavor
it
starts
out
slow
and
comes
big
through
the
middle
the
start
is
of
caramel
malt
and
toffee
in
the
middle
is
a
tart
raspberry
flavor
and
a
sweet
almost
candy
like
flavor
rounded
out
by
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
green
apple
bitterness
again
no
real
hop
presence
the
flavor
was
very
sweet
and
a
little
of
out
balance
but
also
enjoyable
as
an
after
dinner
desert
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
syrupy
and
slightly
slick
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
solid
beer
would
be
good
as
a
dessert
beer
a
big
sweet
taste
dominates
a
definite
try
but
i
dont
know
if
you
could
go
with
too
many
of
these
before
it
would
be
overly
sweet
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
o
a
barley
that
ive
always
liked
if
only
i
can
discipline
myself
to
cellar
some
bottles
without
drinking
them
first
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
for
the
price
im
not
sure
it
is
something
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
it
is
a
perfect
beer
for
an
occasional
desert
or
one
for
the
holidays
worth
a
try
this
beer
seems
to
be
between
the
english
and
todays
american
barely
wines
more
hops
and
certainly
american
hops
are
here
well
carbonated
but
this
doesnt
take
on
that
over
the
top
hops
found
in
beers
such
as
big
foot
the
biggest
short
falling
is
that
this
beer
is
just
too
thin
for
the
style
not
sure
on
the
abv
i
can
taste
it
but
it
drinks
rather
similarly
to
a
pale
ale
though
im
feeling
it
maybe
an
american
old
ale
this
beer
is
going
the
direction
of
some
of
my
favorite
beers
but
there
is
something
just
missing
to
take
it
beyond
just
being
an
average
beer
this
beer
does
explain
why
small
beer
doesnt
workthis
is
a
touch
low
in
malt
so
how
could
you
make
another
beer
off
this
same
malt
a
tastey
and
enjoyable
english
barleywine
that
id
prefer
to
drink
fresh
a
solid
beer
through
and
through
its
not
overly
complex
but
it
is
a
perfect
intro
to
the
style
poured
in
a
snifter
a
light
mohogany
color
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
with
good
lacing
smell
was
mostly
candied
dark
fruits
syrup
sweet
malts
taste
unfortunately
followed
the
smell
too
sweet
for
me
not
too
bad
just
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
i
bought
two
bottles
and
will
age
a
year
and
revisit
mouthfeel
was
average
for
a
bw
overall
i
didnt
enjoy
alot
but
didnt
hate
it
either
no
hop
presence
at
all
overall
solid
barleywine
well
rounded
and
nothing
offensive
going
on
drink
its
a
classic
maybe
i
just
like
bigger
flavors
it
was
tasty
but
i
wanted
more
probably
wont
come
back
to
this
one
ive
been
one
spoilt
boy
lately
for
choice
and
this
another
first
for
me
it
pours
a
see
through
mahogany
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
frothy
two
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
sweet
maltsbarleybrown
sugar
and
xmas
puddingthe
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
and
semi
sticky
with
tastes
of
xmas
puddingcandied
figsburnt
toffeecrystal
malts
and
finished
with
a
estery
fruitness
and
overall
not
bad
pours
a
dark
semiclear
honey
brown
color
with
a
2
inch
light
brown
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
nice
distinct
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
apple
peels
and
malt
taste
is
very
very
sweet
lots
of
brown
sugar
toffee
caramel
sweetness
with
some
toasted
malt
and
citrus
zest
hops
flavors
low
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
pretty
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sticky
and
thick
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
english
barleywine
just
as
the
description
on
ba
states
there
is
definitely
less
emphasis
on
the
hops
compared
to
american
barleywines
a
good
balance
between
sweetness
malt
and
hops
i
have
2
more
of
these
in
my
cellar
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
how
this
beer
develops
over
time
pours
mahogany
in
color
with
only
a
half
a
finger
offwhite
head
poured
thick
and
syrup
like
no
lacing
smells
great
very
sweet
picking
up
candy
sugar
and
sweet
dark
fruits
like
raisins
figs
and
grapes
picking
up
some
alcohol
as
well
the
smell
reminds
me
of
port
taste
is
like
the
nose
dark
fruits
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
warmth
and
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
in
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
and
almost
creamy
this
is
a
great
beer
its
been
available
to
me
for
a
long
time
now
ive
had
it
in
the
past
and
it
didnt
wow
me
this
time
around
it
did
could
be
a
better
year
top
notch
beer
overall
nice
little
reward
for
me
here
with
my
first
cellared
beer
flavors
nicely
grew
more
into
a
nice
tasty
brew
ive
always
like
this
barleywine
now
i
have
to
buy
a
bunch
to
age
for
the
future
pours
a
transparent
light
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
moderately
complex
i
get
notes
of
cascade
hops
and
spicyness
but
the
heavy
sweetness
is
what
carries
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
with
mild
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
to
try
but
i
am
going
to
keep
trying
others
before
i
settle
on
a
regular
barleywine
completely
hidden
in
taste
it
still
sneaks
up
on
you
and
reminds
you
to
slow
down
and
enjoy
life
a
bit
a
very
tasty
and
overall
good
beer
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
again
o
a
sipper
not
necessarily
because
of
the
alcohol
but
due
to
the
sweetness
you
dont
need
a
lot
to
impart
a
large
amount
of
flavor
tasty
not
particularly
complex
but
so
pronounced
that
i
dont
want
one
too
often
a
good
largely
available
barleywine
621
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
buy
again
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
draft
picked
up
a
6er
at
the
local
beer
store
i
poured
this
one
in
a
tulip
the
beer
is
a
hazy
deep
vibrant
ruby
highlighted
brown
coloring
with
a
1inch
offwhite
cream
colored
head
that
settles
in
to
a
thin
film
as
it
sits
dark
fruit
aromas
of
dates
and
caramel
sweetness
with
peppery
spices
and
effervescents
on
the
nose
beer
leaves
a
great
lacing
as
you
drink
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
dark
fruit
sweetness
this
time
more
towards
a
dark
cherry
characteristics
spices
present
on
the
backside
of
the
taste
and
they
are
peppery
and
nutmeg
too
the
body
is
crisp
and
dry
and
the
aftertaste
is
almost
syrupy
sweet
smooth
finish
that
trails
off
slowly
good
tasty
barleywine
its
nice
that
although
anchor
has
been
sold
this
expensivetomake
barley
wine
is
unchanged
vintage
bottle
from
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
pa
dating
back
to
sometime
before
2005
because
it
was
a
7
5oz
bottle
served
at
cellar
room
temperature
very
strong
smell
of
booze
and
strong
malts
the
taste
was
really
good
still
with
some
grainy
malts
and
some
hops
still
in
there
the
flavors
changed
into
something
more
boozey
now
a
definite
sipper
had
all
the
qualities
of
a
good
barley
wine
very
complex
and
very
warming
felt
like
a
was
getting
a
fever
after
i
had
this
one
overall
just
now
on
par
with
the
barleywines
i
enjoy
from
stone
sierra
and
victory
disappointing
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
two
fingers
of
thick
foam
that
slowly
dissipates
nice
raisiny
dried
fruit
and
malt
smell
taste
is
sweet
molasses
and
fruit
with
some
toffee
heavy
smooth
mouthfeel
no
noticeable
alcohol
taste
quite
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
d
enough
flavor
to
make
it
hard
for
me
to
believe
the
8
8
abv
just
classic
english
barleywine
flavors
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
for
sure
it
does
feel
old
fashioned
when
compared
to
what
breweries
are
doing
with
the
style
surprisingly
transparent
in
appearance
a
very
transparent
amber
good
head
upon
pouring
but
dissipates
quickly
to
nothing
mouthfeel
just
like
the
transparency
light
and
thin
almost
watery
for
a
barleywine
nose
leads
with
hops
and
spices
some
bananas
but
more
faintly
tastes
begins
with
hops
sweet
malts
in
the
middle
finishes
fruity
with
caramel
standard
barleywine
overpowered
by
spice
that
kicks
in
and
throws
everything
out
of
whack
purely
opinion
but
spice
is
out
of
place
in
a
bw
yeah
too
spicy
for
my
taste
but
i
also
objectively
feel
that
its
out
of
place
for
the
style
also
way
too
much
warmth
considering
its
only
8
8
which
is
also
a
very
low
abv
for
the
style
but
they
still
somehow
manage
to
not
hide
even
this
low
abv
so
were
left
with
a
low
abv
that
still
comes
out
tasting
slighty
boozy
overall
as
an
ale
its
easily
drinkable
but
nothing
here
to
excite
the
true
barleywine
fan
as
a
barleywine
its
easily
forgettable
d
ive
not
had
this
fresh
before
but
i
cant
imagine
it
has
benefited
from
34
years
of
aging
a
lovely
malt
profile
and
alcohol
well
hidden
maybe
this
is
hotter
fresher
reminds
me
of
skullsplitter
a
lovely
sipper
overall
i
liked
this
barleywine
not
more
that
backburner
old
guardian
or
even
john
john
barleywine
but
its
still
pretty
up
there
as
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
even
more
so
that
the
brooklyn
monster
barleywine
and
thats
the
truth
overall
it
is
a
nice
barleywine
perfect
for
a
dessert
after
a
great
meal
or
for
having
it
when
you
feel
like
drinking
only
one
beer
well
or
maybe
like
me
im
having
this
beer
as
a
closing
beer
after
an
abita
mardi
gras
and
three
old
rasputin
russian
imperial
stouts
no
more
beer
for
today
poured
a
nice
mahogany
with
some
ruby
red
notes
around
the
edges
initial
pour
yielded
no
head
but
a
ring
of
single
bubbles
subsequent
swirls
procured
a
beige
head
nose
has
strong
caramel
and
toffee
notes
some
alcohol
and
notes
of
some
darker
fruits
not
raisinlike
or
anything
but
significantly
lighter
in
the
dark
spectrum
of
fruits
cant
accurately
describe
this
intriguing
nonetheless
and
surely
mouthwatering
taste
is
a
sweet
rich
and
complex
interplay
of
toffee
and
caramel
again
some
warming
alcohol
and
alcohol
soaked
dark
fruits
alcohol
is
well
integrated
in
this
yet
quite
prominent
still
some
bread
and
mild
chocolate
notes
as
it
warms
great
smooth
mouthfeel
and
perfect
carbonation
only
complaint
is
the
prominence
of
the
alcohol
sans
burning
character
at
this
abv
this
bottle
is
listed
as
8
2
and
at
this
age
mouthfeel
becomes
creamier
as
it
warms
great
drinkability
yet
a
bit
heavy
for
the
alcohol
content
enjoyed
this
immensely
nonetheless
great
stuff
and
solid
nightcap
overall
this
is
an
awesome
english
barleywine
great
example
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
would
recommend
it
as
a
must
try
d
astounding
perhaps
this
is
just
the
perfect
confluence
but
at
this
moment
theres
nothing
id
rather
be
drinking
than
this
exact
beer
expertly
crafted
utterly
pleasing
and
definitely
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
with
a
creamy
chewy
body
and
a
nice
dry
finish
the
hop
bitterness
is
light
if
you
ask
me
and
really
could
be
a
touch
more
prickly
another
tasty
brew
from
anchor
brewing
very
tasty
and
a
mild
but
still
a
fantastic
drink
0
i
dug
this
one
i
have
a
softness
for
english
barleys
and
this
is
one
i
would
try
again
d
good
to
try
bar
far
the
worst
barleywine
ive
had
12oz
bowling
pin
shaped
bottle
with
oah
on
the
back
batch
number
maybe
good
amount
of
lacing
pours
a
chestnut
color
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
boozey
and
malty
slight
smell
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
tastes
like
boozey
brown
sugar
nice
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
in
this
one
has
a
nice
burn
to
it
but
its
certainly
a
drinkable
barleywine
overall
it
is
a
solid
entry
to
this
style
of
beer
and
worth
grabbing
again
i
finally
decided
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
in
buffalo
pours
a
reddishcopper
colour
with
thick
offwhite
head
some
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
nice
head
retention
smells
of
brown
sugar
caramel
raisins
and
some
citrus
hops
really
nice
sweetness
in
the
flavour
with
some
bitterness
coming
through
more
after
aftertaste
leaves
lots
of
brown
sugar
too
smooth
mouthfeel
a
really
nice
barleywine
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
one
of
my
favorite
american
barleywines
as
it
is
very
balanced
where
others
are
much
too
hoppy
andor
sweet
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
full
of
complex
flavors
beautiful
bottle
with
an
enticing
illustration
of
barley
on
the
front
no
brewed
on
date
but
my
bottle
has
what
appears
to
be
a
batch
number
i
cant
really
tell
the
lettering
has
faded
8
80
percent
abv
label
though
pours
a
reddish
light
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
not
too
much
lacing
either
alcohol
hits
the
nose
first
which
is
surprising
considering
the
relatively
tame
abv
for
a
barleywine
lots
of
caramel
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
dark
fruit
and
sweet
sugary
malt
appear
in
the
taste
first
with
some
candied
fruit
and
alcohol
the
booze
isnt
as
pronounced
in
the
taste
at
it
is
in
the
aroma
but
it
is
still
pretty
strong
mouthfeel
is
sweet
sticky
and
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
soso
the
abv
itself
doesnt
hold
the
beer
back
but
the
boozy
taste
still
makes
it
a
sipper
pours
a
clear
dark
bronze
with
two
fingers
of
sticky
tan
foam
with
good
retention
the
nose
has
more
undisguised
alcohol
than
i
like
but
has
brown
sugary
malts
dry
sherry
notes
and
an
array
of
hop
aromas
to
help
offset
the
booziness
the
taste
is
quite
complex
and
ponderous
the
front
palate
is
brown
sugary
and
sweet
before
flavors
of
amontillado
and
aged
port
become
more
apparent
in
the
middle
a
back
tea
and
light
citrus
bitterness
provide
some
support
the
body
is
as
full
smooth
and
mouthfilling
as
beer
can
get
dark
fruits
like
dates
and
raisins
along
the
sherry
notes
linger
long
on
the
finish
if
a
beer
can
be
said
to
have
gravitas
this
is
one
that
would
have
it
i
love
it
drinkability
is
fine
for
a
barleywine
but
i
wont
be
pouring
myself
another
to
follow
this
one
d
for
the
price
3
this
a
great
bargain
pretty
solid
barleywine
all
around
only
limiting
factor
is
the
abv
drinkability
10
ounces
is
fine
a
bit
too
boozy
i
enjoy
the
botted
version
better
this
struck
me
as
alright
but
unadventurousunexciting
medium
in
body
smooth
and
decently
drinkable
with
other
barleywines
out
there
that
i
find
much
better
i
dont
think
ill
he
getting
this
again
if
some
other
options
are
available
old
foghorn
is
one
fine
beer
on
the
one
hand
its
hard
to
believe
its
been
in
production
since
1975
on
the
other
hand
its
not
hard
to
believe
that
a
brewery
that
makes
beer
like
this
could
last
35
years
old
foghorn
has
a
whisp
when
the
cap
comes
off
and
when
poured
a
brownish
red
gloss
of
liquid
comes
out
some
very
weak
bubbles
and
nothing
in
terms
of
a
cap
this
beer
looks
pretty
dead
all
right
smell
is
real
tame
considering
the
style
and
the
brewery
i
really
gotta
sniff
to
get
toasty
malted
barley
some
pound
cake
light
fruits
and
well
thats
it
alcohol
does
not
come
out
but
it
is
a
bit
light
in
the
loafers
per
style
foghorn
is
a
come
and
go
bwine
blunt
and
to
the
point
caramel
coated
fruit
with
some
toasted
bread
some
toffee
light
chocolate
to
put
it
in
the
front
nothing
really
stands
out
i
was
looking
for
a
bit
of
a
alcohol
sting
to
remind
me
what
im
drinking
feel
is
a
big
medium
with
a
low
hardly
felt
carb
it
could
use
a
boost
reminds
me
of
ridge
runner
by
rock
art
but
that
seemed
to
have
more
ummpphh
to
it
a
good
drinker
but
a
bit
overpriced
for
what
it
is
d
a
balanced
example
of
a
barleywine
and
as
such
deceptively
drinkable
if
it
didnt
smell
like
alcohol
i
would
assume
it
to
be
designed
as
a
session
beer
the
strong
smell
of
booze
gives
it
away
though
d
an
excellent
beer
sweet
and
malty
with
a
heft
that
would
hold
up
on
a
cold
night
in
the
lighthouse
d
this
is
a
really
good
barleywine
that
is
easy
to
drink
although
i
feel
it
really
lacks
depth
and
complexity
perhaps
with
some
age
some
of
the
other
flavors
will
come
out
and
develop
either
way
this
is
a
great
one
to
introduce
newcomers
to
the
style
d
i
certainly
give
them
their
due
respect
for
producing
the
first
modern
barleywine
but
this
was
too
sweet
for
my
taste
pours
a
deep
clear
red
amber
color
with
minimal
head
has
a
nice
spice
citrus
like
taste
and
has
a
nice
warm
finish
has
a
light
sour
taste
but
doesnt
last
has
a
zesty
mouth
feel
between
spices
and
carbonation
not
overly
sweetened
has
herbal
almost
pine
scented
aroma
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
pine
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
brown
sugar
toffee
caramel
pine
oranges
and
alcohol
the
beer
tastes
like
candy
very
interesting
and
very
nice
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
fairly
alcoholic
yet
flavorful
a
little
heavy
yet
matched
with
nice
complexity
foghorn
is
a
nice
english
barleywine
and
was
even
better
when
enjoyed
with
some
sweet
thai
basil
d
its
been
years
since
i
had
one
of
these
and
i
must
say
this
tastes
way
better
than
i
remember
amazing
full
delicious
flavor
the
only
drawback
and
i
know
its
a
barleywine
is
the
high
alcohol
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
d
this
beer
is
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
frigid
evening
im
glad
i
held
onto
it
d
a
relaxing
brew
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
though
it
does
have
a
lot
of
flavor
i
think
that
its
too
much
for
my
taste
buds
to
handle
a
very
well
crafted
beer
wicked
smooth
and
way
to
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
of
this
size
extremely
well
balanced
i
gotta
say
a
hair
better
than
sn
bigfoot
enjoyed
this
each
time
ive
had
it
definitely
want
another
one
right
after
nothing
here
flavor
or
feel
thats
a
turnoff
wellbalanced
not
boastful
overall
thanks
to
wisrarebeer
this
is
my
first
barleywine
old
foghorn
has
a
distinct
malty
sweet
hops
taste
it
appears
light
and
feels
light
on
the
palate
but
the
taste
is
heavy
and
complex
and
overall
quite
nice
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
poured
a
clear
orangecopper
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
to
just
a
film
there
was
a
good
strong
sweet
aroma
with
a
hint
of
orange
there
was
a
silky
thick
texture
with
a
bold
alcohol
feel
initially
a
creamy
sweetness
of
caramel
molasses
and
raisins
developed
followed
by
a
mild
bitterness
towards
the
finish
with
the
alcohol
to
counter
balance
the
sweetness
a
good
warmth
on
the
finish
from
the
alcohol
one
of
the
better
barleywines
i
had
d
great
beer
for
under
5
i
wish
fritz
included
a
date
on
the
bottle
solid
barley
wine
d
one
of
the
more
drinkable
barleywines
out
there
very
good
stuff
rich
malty
sweetness
and
not
super
hoppy
mmmmm
d
for
a
barleywine
it
is
very
approachable
meh
guess
ive
been
spoiled
by
american
style
barley
wines
but
when
compared
to
blithering
idiot
as
a
companion
in
the
style
this
one
fails
to
move
me
d
pretty
good
beer
thick
rich
and
rather
tasty
recommended
d
this
is
solid
for
the
style
and
is
certainly
reasonably
priced
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
fresh
and
thought
it
was
quite
wellbalanced
overall
will
make
a
point
to
pick
up
some
more
for
the
cellar
taste
kicks
things
up
a
notch
nothing
onedimensional
here
theres
a
simultaneous
blast
of
alcohol
sweet
maltiness
and
perfectly
balanced
hops
fused
into
the
mix
creamy
but
lively
mouthfeel
allows
a
nice
but
fast
fade
this
would
be
nearly
perfect
if
the
carbonation
was
slightly
less
and
the
mouthfeel
more
lush
still
nearly
perfect
and
i
imagine
the
draft
version
is
better
quite
drinkable
at
this
high
but
lowerthanexpected
barleywine
nice
interepretation
by
anchor
d
this
is
a
fair
and
easy
drinking
barleywine
i
would
suggest
this
one
to
people
who
want
to
get
into
the
style
a
lower
abv
on
this
makes
it
also
wasy
for
the
first
time
drinker
of
barleywines
anchor
made
a
good
tasting
and
easy
drinking
beer
in
a
style
that
likes
to
go
over
the
top
with
flavor
and
aroma
profile
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
barleywine
a
really
solid
example
of
the
english
style
for
me
a
biut
pricey
for
a
six
pack
but
definitely
something
i
will
get
from
time
to
time
a
generally
agreeable
oldnewworld
barleywine
the
hops
betraying
its
west
coast
origins
despite
the
english
style
aspirations
not
particularly
complex
and
drinkable
only
until
that
inevitable
barrier
is
crossed
i
have
to
assume
as
i
only
have
the
single
serving
d
i
prefer
the
more
hoppy
american
barleywine
to
the
more
mild
english
barleywine
this
one
was
very
drinkable
and
one
i
would
like
to
pair
with
a
good
cigar
a
really
good
barleywine
only
down
point
was
the
high
level
of
alcohol
im
sure
this
would
mellow
out
with
some
age
wish
i
had
bought
more
for
this
purpose
a
very
nice
barleywine
that
is
quite
enjoyable
and
on
for
the
style
a
nice
nice
brew
from
a
craft
icon
d
drinkability
is
moderately
low
the
sweetness
just
pushes
this
beer
a
bit
too
much
and
the
hops
are
a
bit
too
muted
to
counteract
this
i
understand
that
barleywines
are
notably
maltoriented
but
this
one
could
use
a
little
less
sweetness
however
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
only
coming
through
about
midway
and
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
malts
crystal
clear
ruby
color
with
plenty
of

sticks

resinous
slightly
citric
hops
to
match

is
more
sweet
malts

the
malt

definitely
takes
center
stage
while
not
terribly
complex
it
has
a
very
smooth
flavor
good
mouthfeel
sweet
but
not
as
sweet
as
many
others
in
the
style
really
good
barleywine
all
around
and
certainly
going
to
pick
more
of
this
up
soon
i
found
this
barley
wine
to
be
middle
of
the
road
and
easy
to
down
there
was
not
some

for

so
dgood
for

it

wines
a

that
im

doing

never

this
its
a
good

and
id
have
it
again
d
a

brew
balanced
enough
for
a
barleywine
for
me
to
enjoy
it
fully
when
my

was

would
have
been
the

i
liked
this
one
not
crazy
amazing
but
good
especially
to
find
on
tap
a
very
solid
english
barleywine
not
my
favorite
so
far
but
for
around
2
its
not
that
bad
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
and
is
hidden
well
but
shows
up
here
and
there
drinkability
a
fairly
decent
barleywine
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
given
its
high
abv
and
noticeable
alcohol
flavor
its
certainly
not
the
best
barleywine
out
there
but
it
is
still
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
other
beers
give
it
a
shot
overall
decent
barley
wine
but
feels
a
tad
lacking
in
the
overall
balance
d
a
decent
barleywine
all
around
the
low
alcohol
for
a
barlywine
at
least
allows
for
a
six
pack
session
a
good
example
of
the
style
everything
is
there
just
needs
a
bit
of
tweaking
to
put
it
in
balance
d
its
a
sipper
since
it
pretty
sweet
and
rich
just
like
it
says
on
the
bottle
its
good
for
an
after
dinner
beernight

beer
to
sip
when
youre
actually
in
the
mood
to
sip
a
sweet
and
boozy
barleywine
a
little
less

would
make
me
enjoy
it

might
argue
that

drinkability
great
barleywine
that
might
not
be
as
complex
as
others
that
have
followed
its
lead
but
just
a
great
sipper
dm
great
flavors
really
make
it
nice
to
drink
but
it
must
be
sipped
the
depth
and
sweetness
make
it
both
nice
to
drink
but
also
slightly
filling
as
inidicated
on
the
bottle
i
would
have
to
agree
that
it
is
more
of
a
postdinner
dessert
beer
overall
old
foghorn
is
dominated
by
its
strong
alcoholic
character
it
was
my
first
barley
wine
but
unfortunately
i
was
not
impressed
not
my
stuff
overall
a
very
nice
barley
wine
its
a
bit
young
with
some
big
sweetness
battling
some
harsh
alcohol
but
its
still
good
now
id
love
to
try
this
aged
d
goes
down
very
easily
smooth
beer
i
would
say
comparable
beers
would
be
bigfoot
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
especially
as
a
introduction
to
the
style
overall
a
solid
beer
a
great
brew
to
share
with
buddies
to
ease
them
into
more
intense
beers
i
will
be
trying
this
again
sometime
mouthfeel
is
tangy
then
finishes
smooth
very
pleasant
evening
drink
rjt
drinkability
better
than
average
but
not
the
first
barlewine
id
reach
for
while
the
citrusy
hops
liven
things
up
the
malt
base
is
pretty
uninspired
and
the
alcohol
presence
is
way
too
high
for
the
abv
i
can
certainly
appreciate
this
being
the
original
american
barleywine
but
there
are
many
better
options
now

tangerines

a
very

english
barleywine
carbonation
may
be
a
little
too
assertive
but
quite
flavorful
and
drinkable
might
be
worth
saving
a
few
to
cellar
d
drinkable
yes
but
more
than
likely
id
stop
at
just
the
one
the
prevalence
of
the
alcohol
afterwords
is
a
little
on
the
stronger
side
from
what
id
prefer
d
very
tasty
with
a
strong
alcohol
taste
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
still
a
good
beer
enjoyable
but
do
not
think
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
what
do
you
expect
with
9
abv
pours
a
moderate
copper
color
with
a
bit
if
a
head
and
small
amouts
of
lacing
nose
is
quite
nice
with
some
good
fruitiness
as
well
as
some
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
remindig
me
a
bit
of
cake
quite
tasty
and
i
imagine
this
will
age
really
well
medium
body
without
much
of
any
boozy
presence
drinks
quite
nicely
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
aging
a
bit
of
this
d
this
bottle
was
quite
easy
to
put
away
its
a
shame
this
beer
is
so
expensive
because
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
purchasing
it
all
that
often
very
drinkable
all
the
way
down
with
increasing
malty
sweetness
towards
room
temp
perhaps
not
quaffable
perhaps
too
sweet
for
some
food
choices
such
as
pasta
or
even
pizza
the
alcohol
content
does
sneak
up
on
you
and
one
is
enough
i
will
not
totally
write
this
one
off
some
barleywines
just
need
some
serious
time
to
mellow
out
and
change
for
the
flavors
to
develop
maybe
ill
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
if
i
can
find
a
single
to
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
at
any
rate
this
isnt
anything
special
fresh
and
definitely
imho
not
worth
16
a
sixer
overall
its
purty
good
id
love
to
find
it
on
tp
somewhere
from
the
bottle
its
maybe
a
little
too
strong
id
like
to
try
it
aged
for
2
years
d
good
drinkability
only
slight
mentions
of
booze
but
not
enough
to
keep
chugging
this
down
a
very
good
example
per
style
and
case
worthy
option
here
drinkability
its
quite
nice
and
is
quite
fitting
for
a
nice
cool
night
like
this
definitely
a
sipper
with
an
abv
near
10
not
to
mention
it
was
4bottle
a
bit
steep
but
could
be
a
nice
treat
every
once
in
a
while
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
but
still
carries
it
well
overall
an
enjoyable
barleywine
especially
since
its
not
the
hopforward
ipalike
barleywines
that
many
other
american
breweries
are
putting
out
highly
recommended
drinks
rather
well
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
thats
not
unusual
for
a
barleywine
this
one
claims
and
identity
and
its
welcome
nice
though
not
my
favorite
beautiful
clear
dark
mahogany
brew
gives
a
small
but
dense
and
creamy
tan
head
smell
is
thick
and
sweet
like
cordial
cherries
with
a
whole
bunch
of
florals
taste
is
also
pretty
sweet
cherries
and
florals
with
a
spicy
booze
and
anise
note
cutting
through
feel
is
a
mediumthick
body
finishes
boozy
decent
not
the
best
but
very
drinkable
overall
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
as
something
different
i
enjoy
the
complexity
of
flavors
and
aromas
this
one
is
definetly
more
about
the
malt
but
the
hops
are
do
a
good
job
of
adding
depth
not
a
bad
brew
id
probably
drink
it
again
a
good
sipper
drinks
a
tad
warm
as
the
alcohol
is
not
shy
in
this
one
it
sticks
out
equally
with
the
rest
of
the
gang
lots
of
good
fruit
flavors
and
plenty
of
malt
actually
has
a
nice
citrus
aftertaste
not
sure
ill
buy
again
at
16
a
six
pack
exceptionally
balanced
though
lacking
the
vinuous
qualities
i
usually
associate
with
an
english
vs
american
barleywine
not
the
most
distinctive
example
but
still
very
enjoyable
drinkability
even
with
the
9
4
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
sweet
due
to
the
low
carbonation
and
smooth
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
probably
helps
this
factor
overall
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
its
not
my
favorite
barleywine
pours
amber
with
a
thin
tannish
offwhite
head
smells
like
dark
fruits
raisins
malty
with
some
brownburnt
sugar
taste
like
dark
fruits
which
quickly
fade
into
nothing
but
a
little
alcohol
kinda
disappointed
i
wish
the
flavor
was
a
bit
more
robust
and
had
more
staying
power
drinkability
is
okay
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
either
full
bodied
smooth
perfectly
carbonated
and
the
alcohol
is
well
disguised
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
cotton
candy
and
caramel
sweetness
are
the
heavy
hitters
on
the
palate
and
comes
off
as
a
bit
onedimensional
at
first
slowly
some
earthy
and
citric
bitterness
as
well
as
some
raisinesque
fruitiness
come
through
good
enough
beer
and
i
could
see
it
aging
well
for
a
few
more
years
if
not
longer
but
it
does
not
interest
me
enough
to
take
up
precious
cellar
space
with
this
was
a
very
good
beer
there
was
so
much
complex
flavor
every
sip
seemed
to
expose
something
new
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
easy
to
drink
as
it
was
very
filling
got
things
to
do
like
watch
football
make
dinner
and
work
on
something
pours
a
beautiful
dark
maple
syrup
color
no
discernable
head
albeit
with
good
carbonation
smell
carries
a
lot
of
pineapple
good
maltiness
but
not
a
lotta
hop
character
flavor
is
a
sharp
combination
of
malt
very
very
sweet
with
maybe
slightly
overripe
fig
in
there
mouth
is
not
a
thick
and
chewy
as
i
expected
but
pleasantly
drinkable
not
cheaply
priced
though
at
2
4912oz
bottle
good
beer
but
not
spectacular
anchor
foghorn
pours
a
light
reddish
brown
it
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
back
roads
of
oklahoma
when
the
clay
gets
wet
or
the
dirt
at
the
saturday
night
races
the
head
is
a
thick
bambooliketan
it
continues
to
lace
the
pint
glass
as
it
sits
the
nose
is
sweet
raisins
and
plums
fragrant
the
air
it
has
a
rich
thick
feel
that
coats
every
corner
of
my
mouth
it
has
sweet
yet
dry
fruits
that
roll
around
as
well
a
tartness
lingers
on
the
finish
and
a
feeling
of
alcohol
warms
the
depths
of
my
belly
i
would
treat
this
beer
much
like
i
would
a
port
wine
perfect
for
after
dinner
or
with
my
favorite
cigar
this
beer
has
a
pretty
big
body
to
it
with
a
smooth
drinkable
feel
it
is
pretty
drinkable
with
a
nice
english
barelywine
feel
this
is
one
of
the
first
extreme
beers
brewed
in
america
since
that
nasty
prohibition
we
had
a
while
back
and
still
holds
up
to
todays
taste
its
hard
to
beat
a
classic
t
it
has
a
malty
nut
taste
to
it
just
like
the
scent
suggests
the
alcohol
is
strong
bold
its
also
quite
carbonated
im
tasting
some
apple
in
there
too
drinkability
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
that
i
can
imagine
is
very
good
with
age
so
maybe
ill
pick
out
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
stuff
for
cellaring
not
the
best
barleywine
i
can
remember
tasting
but
still
a
damn
good
one
d
this
is
a
very
solid
barleywine
very
nice
palate
makes
this
very
drinkable
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
one
ages
it
will
be
hard
to
beat
this
fresh
notes
a
good
barleywine
that
does
not
have
to
be
enjoyed
only
in
the
heart
of
winter
this
beer
has
legs
and
is
awesome
solid
all
around
d
this
is
an
excellent
american
barleywine
and
it
was
rated
as
such
the
hops
are
too
aggressive
for
the
english
style
while
it
isnt
quite
as
aggressive
as
some
american
versions
it
still
has
the
character
this
is
a
sipper
like
allbarleywines
and
a
classic
from
the
vanguard
craft
brewery
this
is
one
of
the
better
english
style
barleywines
ive
tried
it
has
quality
in
taste
without
being
overbearing
overly
alcoholic
or
pungent
overall
a
delicate
english
barleywine
09
not
sure
how
much
these
vary
from
year
to
year
still
in
a
landscape
devoid
of
truely
great
beers
not
a
bad
buy
to
celler
it
improves
with
time
been
only
about
6
months
so
far
so
its
a
wait
hold
drinkability
is
decent
alcohol
is
wellhidden
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
overall
good
barley
wine
really
enjoyed
it
there
is
a
signature
style
that
anchor
brewing
has
and
this
is
well
with
in
that
style
cheers
to
anchor
glad
i
tried
this
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
is
a
very
balanced
and
very
drinkable
barleywine
you
can
easily
get
into
a
bit
of
trouble
having
a
few
of
these
nothing
too
strong
in
taste
but
nice
subtle
flavors
and
no
strong
alcohol
so
its
not
restricted
to
sipping
over
a
long
period
of
time
overall
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
worth
your
time
this
is
the
first
barleywine
i
have
ever
had
that
i
really
liked
a
7oz
nip
bottle
code
puts
this
as
an
03
uncapped
and
poured
into
a
selins
grove
wine
glass
appears
a
murky
chestnut
brown
color
with
barely
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
head
leaves
no
lace
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
molasses
port
wine
raisins
dark
brown
sugar
black
cherries
prunes
mildly
carbonated
which
world
well
here
but
the
body
is
thinner
than
youd
expect
from
a
barleywine
a
very
nice
sipper
overall
d
as
i
said
i
picked
up
an
empty
glass
so
its
quite
drinkable
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
lot
more
sweeter
than
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
san
francisco
poured
into
a
small
6
ounce
fluted
glass
lovely
hop
aroma
balanced
by
some
malt
sweetness
looks
a
touch
thin
a
light
ruby
color
taste
is
also
bitter
balanced
with
some
over
ripe
pit
fruit
sweetness
abc
is
very
very
well
hidden
i
believe
this
is
the
first
in
this
style
made
in
america
so
credit
must
be
given
for
setting
the
bar
that
many
others
have
leapt
over
delicious
none
the
less
d
nice
sipping
beer
to
have
as
an
after
dinner
cordial
or
even
with
desert
im
a
recent
convert
to
anchor
but
an
old
hand
at
barley
wine
so
you
can
imagine
my
excitement
when
i
found
a
few
bottles
of
this
on
the
shelves
of
vintage
cellar
i
grabbed
them
without
hesitation
the
smell
isnt
as
welcoming
as
some
other
barley
wines
duck
rabbit
sam
adams
longshot
etc
the
taste
though
is
right
on
the
money
i
honestly
think
my
tongue
kept
tingling
long
after
i
had
finished
the
initial
taste
most
impressive
those
guys
in
san
fran
know
their
stuff
i
cant
wait
to
cellar
my
other
two
for
a
bit
and
pull
them
out
one
snowy
night
its
a
big
and
boisterous
beer
this
one
but
it
feels
too
much
so
theres
nothing
lively
or
jubilant
about
it
it
ends
up
sitting
heavy
serious
and
rather
depressingly
unenjoyable
id
say
i
prefer
it
with
a
lil
less
age
on
it
but
not
to
say
that
there
is
a
lot
wrong
with
it
i
suppose
it
is
oxidized
though
carbonation
is
assertive
enough
to
keep
it
from
becoming
syrupy
mouthfeel
is
fairly
dry
its
hard
to
call
a
barleywine
drinkable
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
appearance
amber
very
little
head
in
appearance
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smell
malty
sweetness
dark
fruits
taste
sweet
malty
caramel
dark
fruits
not
as
intense
as
i
would
have
expected
this
is
my
first
barleywine
so
im
not
sure
what
to
compare
it
to
yet
mouthfeel
very
thin
i
dont
know
that
id
try
this
particular
barleywine
again
but
id
at
least
try
the
style
again
notes
best
before
june
2011
this
is
a
bit
lighter
more
subdued
barleywine
fairly
malty
with
enough
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
but
they
are
not
dominant
overall
it
was
a
nice
light
and
easy
to
drink
barleywine
not
as
big
and
boozy
and
a
bit
less
of
a
night
capping
beer
but
a
lighter
more
accessible
barleywine
not
an
amazing
tasting
beer
but
a
solid
one
definitely
worth
trying
and
i
would
get
it
again
especially
considering
the
price
clean
crisp
beer
with
an
average
apperance
with
a
solid
2
finger
white
head
and
sweet
smell
taste
is
plesent
with
an
earth
hoppy
bit
for
and
aft
the
middle
is
balanced
with
a
spicey
sweetness
that
blends
well
with
the
alcohol
content
it
is
just
within
my
liking
but
definately
worth
the
3
i
spent
and
will
get
it
again
all
in
all
a
pretty
average
barleywine
but
i
expect
more
from
a
fine
brewer
such
as
anchor
really
not
worth
the
abv
if
im
going
to
drink
something
with
punch
i
want
something
thats
going
to
warrant
the
beating
my
liver
is
going
to
take
drinkability
fits
the
style
well
enough
not
particularly
unique
drinkability
severely
reduced
by
the
alcohol
heat
mouthfeel
is
full
and
slick
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
get
it
again
a
classic
im
always
happy
to
revisit
slightly
sweet
and
a
bit
light
on
flavor
it
still
is
tasty
no
serious
knocks
but
doesnt
distinguish
itself
all
in
all
this
brew
surprised
me
for
the
cheap
price
this
is
an
excellent
english
barleywine
might
be
one
of
my
goto
brews
from
now
on
if
you
like
the
sweeter
side
of
barleywines
then
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
need
hops
this
might
not
be
for
you
d
good
drinkability
for
a
barleywine
with
a
8
abv
still
two
might
be
the
max
for
me
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
cloudy
light
mahogany
color
with
particulates
floating
around
with
a
small
offwhite
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
dominated
by
toffee
malts
very
sweet
toffee
flavor
with
a
crisp
finish
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
d
i
feel
the
alcohol
more
than
taste
it
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
the
carbonation
gives
it
more
crispness
very
drinkable
with
a
syrupy
mouth
feel
in
the
beginning
but
thin
and
hard
from
the
alochol
at
the
end
the
smell
was
great
hop
flavors
were
difficult
to
taste
and
were
over
taken
by
the
maltiness
definitely
weaker
than
other
barleywines
ive
had
but
it
was
a
good
place
to
start
getting
back
into
them
not
really
something
i
care
for
only
my
second
english
barleywine
and
have
decided
it
is
not
my
style
but
you
never
know
til
you
give
it
a
fair
shot
to
the
next
35
years
all
told
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
its
got
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
content
though
is
extremely
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
i
guess
i
would
call
it
a
gnarlywine
light
not
quite
as
heavy
heady
and
complex
as
other
more
potent
bws
but
pleasant
for
what
it
is
in
my
opinion
this
is
american
craft
brewing
history
in
a
glass
not
the
most
powerful
barleywine
but
bigger
doesnt
always
equate
to
better
cellar
a
few
of
these
the
malt
will
mature
3
50
per
12
0z
bottle
is
still
pretty
good
for
americas
first
barley
wine
in
the
modern
age
d
terrific
and
wonderfully
drinkable
this
brew
oozes
with
character
and
malty
goodness
what
this
beer
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
for
with
a
simple
sincerity
quite
quaffable
especially
considering
the
8
2
abv
i
would
gladly
welcome
in
my
glass
again
and
recommend
to
all
d
this
is
pleasant
enough
but
i
really
believe
it
needs
some
time
in
the
cellar
to
really
come
alive
right
now
though
drinking
well
the
slight
bitter
plastic
taste
is
a
bit
much
d
pretty
drinkable
and
tasty
the
body
is
pretty
full
and
very
creamy
the
carbonation
is
pretty
high
keeping
it
very
crisp
and
lively
throughout
the
dry
finish
is
long
and
mouthwatering
i
sensed
the
alcohol
in
every
whiffsniff
which
kept
me
under
control
when
trying
to
gulp
it
down
great
beer
d
the
alcohol
and
sugary
stickyness
kind
of
limits
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
it
is
a
decent
barleywine
that
has
quite
a
kick
over
all
this
is
a
great
beer
havent
had
very
many
in
this
style
but
this
is
a
great
beer
regardless
overall
not
bad
but
id
take
a
stone
old
guardian
way
before
this
sweet
bad
boy
just
too
sweet
but
is
complex
with
a
world
of
fantastic
malty
flavors
d
a
very
drinkable
barlywine
a
bit
weak
maybe
but
delicious
none
the
less
alcohol
is
present
but
by
no
means
hot
or
uncomfortable
the
hops
are
balanced
with
the
toasted
malt
and
fruit
flavors
but
they
add
a
nice
subtle
grassy
bite
in
the
finish
this
is
a
good
gateway
to
the
style
not
that
im
an
expert
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
its
been
a
while
since
ive
tried
a
barleywine
and
until
i
split
this
glass
with
my
brother
i
thought
it
was
a
style
that
had
no
personal
appeal
i
cant
deny
that
anchor
did
a
fantastic
job
with
this
beer
though
i
definitely
recommend
that
everyone
give
it
a
try
again
i
think
anchor
pegged
the
style
perfectly
as
an
english
barleywine
one
of
my
favorite
styles
you
expect
the
sweetness
and
the
fruit
tones
but
this
has
just
the
right
balance
of
hops
just
to
remind
you
it
is
still
a
beer
and
a
great
one
at
that
fritz
maytag
of
anchor
brewing
is
a
known
craft
beer
legend
and
this
beer
is
to
me
their
most
under
rated
offering
my
hats
off
to
to
them
d
the
sweetness
of
it
leads
me
to
not
give
it
a
great
rating
i
really
enjoyed
about
the
first
23
of
the
brew
but
the
last
13
was
just
a
little
too
sweet
and
sticky
one
and
done
for
me
thank
you
and
ill
probably
enjoy
another
in
a
couple
of
months
or
so
to
me
the
old
foghorn
is
extremely
tasty
but
i
find
it
to
be
a
bit
much
not
an
example
of
what
i
consider
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
ale
for
sipping
after
a
good
meal
pours
a
brilliant
dark
amber
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
tan
head
that
stood
up
fairly
well
complex
toasty
malt
notes
and
earthy
hops
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
aroma
big
malt
flavor
again
toasty
with
a
sweet
caramel
like
bite
earthy
hop
flavors
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
is
noted
is
well
carbonated
the
head
persisted
given
the
alcohol
level
the
sweet
toasty
malt
profile
carries
well
into
the
aftertaste
but
has
enough
hop
bitterness
to
keep
it
from
being
sickly
sweet
d
this
is
a
very
nice
sipping
barleywine
from
anchor
depth
and
complexity
give
it
a
thoughtprovoking
aura
and
its
one
hell
of
a
brew
to
sip
while
i
work
on
design
this
may
be
a
great
beer
to
cellar
or
it
may
not
be
if
the
caramel
malts
would
assimilate
with
the
fruitiness
that
would
be
a
pleasant
change
losing
the
hops
would
unbalance
it
severely
on
the
other
hand
too
sweet
give
me
more
english
hops
overall
a
good
barleywine
but
not
a
great
one
i
have
a
sixer
or
two
of
this
and
will
sit
on
it
longer
to
see
if
the
sweetness
mellows
out
a
little
and
allows
the
other
qualities
of
the
malts
to
come
through
i
think
this
has
great
potential
but
for
the
price
of
nearly
3
a
bottle
i
think
ill
pass
in
the
future
overall
good
beer
drinkability
was
good
for
a
barleywine
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
but
a
steal
for
3
dollars
a
bottle
will
buy
some
more
to
age
for
acouple
years
d
while
there
is
some
alcohol
is
present
in
the
nose
and
taste
of
this
beer
it
does
not
detract
from
the
drinkability
give
this
one
a
try
for
sure
im
pleased
with
this
one
d
one
of
the
first
few
barleywines
ive
had
i
knew
there
was
a
reason
ive
been
becoming
more
curious
about
barleywines
as
of
late
and
its
because
of
treasures
like
this
makes
me
think
i
may
prefer
the
english
style
over
the
american
style
of
barleywines
this
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
caramel
and
rusty
copper
with
some
bready
yeast
and
honey
wheat
and
nutty
malt
it
tasted
like
copper
and
caramel
and
nutty
malt
with
some
sweet
raisin
and
bready
yeast
it
was
oily
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
pretty
tasty
with
nice
body
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
too
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
it
had
surprisingly
sharp
hops
to
balance
the
very
sweet
malt
but
aging
this
could
turn
this
into
a
great
malt
bomb
fresh
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
barleywine
although
not
too
exciting
time
was
a
good
friend
to
old
foghorn
three
years
of
cellaring
was
definitely
worth
the
wait
as
the
character
comes
through
and
the
sharpness
has
been
mellowed
out
bw
or
old
ale
you
make
the
decision
i
say
old
ale
on
this
one
but
it
is
good
in
either
category
very
pleasant
and
tasty
and
one
of
the
easier
drinking
barleywines
out
there
in
my
humble
opinion
certainly
worth
a
try
d
easy
drinking
bw
if
one
does
exist
this
is
it
classic
brew
d
one
of
the
easier
drinking
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
good
flavor
with
an
even
better
balance
smell
and
feel
if
you
are
looking
for
a
more
sessionable
barleywine
seek
this
one
out
poured
into
a
pint
rather
than
a
tulip
or
other
appropriate
glass
honey
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
vanished
immediately
smell
of
rasins
plum
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
soft
at
first
with
a
following
of
alcohol
tang
over
a
plesant
carbonation
taste
is
of
plum
fig
rasins
and
christmas
fruitcake
a
malty
sweetness
pulls
it
all
together
a
warm
and
satisfying
finish
of
alcohol
makes
the
day
after
the
day
after
christmas
melt
into
a
warm
and
glowing
end
very
nice
d
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
barleywine
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
at
only
a
little
above
8
abv
it
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
style
but
maybe
it
is
a
good
barleywine
to
start
with
if
you
are
new
to
the
style
it
was
for
me
merry
christmas
everybody
drinkability
there
are
few
beers
that
i
would
like
to
have
warm
me
around
the
christmas
season
more
so
than
this
one
this
beer
comes
at
the
tail
end
of
a
wonderful
time
with
a
six
pack
during
a
week
that
included
over
a
foot
of
snow
fall
on
a
weekend
trapping
me
inside
definitely
a
sipper
but
really
enjoyable
good
beer
for
the
winter
that
i
like
a
lot
drinkability
this
one
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
it
would
be
easy
to
have
too
much
in
an
evening
it
goes
down
easily
with
each
sip
leaving
you
wanting
another
ill
be
glad
to
have
another
and
will
certainly
seek
this
one
out
in
the
future
drinkabilityoverall
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
but
its
different
and
it
gets
the
job
done
just
let
it
warm
before
you
tackle
it
trust
me
very
nice
very
nice
ive
got
to
say
barleywines
that
come
in
6
packs
make
me
very
happy
so
many
come
in
bombers
and
4
packs
that
good
values
like
this
and
bigfoot
are
a
nice
change
d
wow
this
is
drinkable
dangerously
drinkable
i
wouldnt
guess
this
to
be
more
than
6
alcohol
by
taste
but
8
8
abv
is
fitting
for
the
style
its
just
so
well
hidden
the
bottle
is
fresh
though
so
ill
be
kind
judging
it
give
it
some
time
its
is
a
9
4
barleywine
after
all
a
year
in
the
cellar
may
make
it
a
far
more
enjoyable
brew
initially
the
first
thing
you
taste
is
a
medium
bitter
hop
flavor
which
is
then
followed
by
a
malty
brown
sugar
and
clove
ending
the
hops
and
brown
sugarclove
flavor
lightens
and
blends
together
during
the
aftertaste
the
beer
has
a
slight
warmth
going
down
and
there
is
a
slight
dryness
that
follows
you
might
want
to
try
this
if
you
like
belgian
beer
styles
like
chimay
blue
overall
incredible
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
a
big
strong
barleywine
flavor
and
this
one
was
on
the
light
side
thats
ok
all
beers
dont
have
to
be
overpowering
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
wow
i
cant
believe
ive
waited
this
long
to
try
this
beer
one
of
the
best
moderate
bwines
ive
ever
had
almost
like
an
alt
in
flavor
but
a
little
sweeter
and
a
better
smell
plus
this
beer
is
much
more
drinkable
than
any
other
barleywine
ive
had
i
would
characterize
it
as
a
barleywine
5
so
not
really
intense
but
with
the
flavor
that
you
will
value
if
you
enjoy
a
barleywine
by
far
teh
most
drinkable
barleywine
ive
had
but
doesnt
really
give
you
the
flavor
complexity
of
a
behemoth
old
ruination
or
a
green
flash
had
a
2
yr
old
vintage
on
tap
and
actually
prefer
the
fresh
version
without
the
hop
presence
this
beer
isnt
as
complex
as
it
once
was
anchor
is
not
know
for
their
beers
cellar
life
and
thats
okay
this
was
a
one
time
experiment
and
defintely
not
a
failure
hold
on
to
it
for
no
more
than
a
year
youre
not
missing
much
would
be
great
as
a
nightcap
a
great
candidate
to
drink
fresh
or
lay
down
d
i
first
sampled
this
at
a
beer
festival
in
japan
it
was
clearly
the
winner
in
my
heart
next
to
all
the
domestic
beers
but
i
wanted
to
come
back
and
properly
review
this
one
as
the
1st
beer
of
the
day
and
not
the
10th
im
even
more
impressed
awesome
would
be
a
good
word
tons
of
flavors
coexisting
in
peace
and
harmony
like
an
international
food
fair
this
has
just
the
right
balance
that
one
could
enjoy
this
by
itself
or
with
a
meal
the
flavors
are
strong
enough
to
be
interesting
but
not
so
strong
theyd
overpower
something
im
really
impressed
by
this
beer
d
not
bad
overall
i
would
say
but
the
high
abv
combined
with
some
slightly
out
of
balance
flavors
makes
this
a
one
timer
for
me
i
think
regardless
i
would
only
drink
one
of
these
at
a
time
perhaps
a
little
age
would
improve
this
drinkability
very
nice
will
drink
again
and
will
try
the
aging
one
probably
in
a
year
or
so
d
well
made
beereasy
drinking
but
i
kind
of
lose
my
interest
after
one
d
the
more
this
airs
out
and
warms
up
the
better
it
gets
there
are
some
funky
notes
on
the
palate
that
i
really
enjoy
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
but
definitely
a
respectable
one
that
ill
be
buying
again
d
this
incredibly
fruity
and
dry
barleywine
is
very
drinkable
and
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
expected
d
very
drinkable
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
this
would
be
fresh
d
a
very
nice
oldschool
barleywine
from
anchor
well
balanced
and
undeniably
tasty
this
has
been
the
coldest
day
so
far
this
fall
and
i
dont
mind
sipping
this
after
work
at
all
i
would
buy
again
medium
to
full
bodied
with
appropiate
amount
of
carbonation
i
havent
been
the
biggest
fan
of
anchor
in
the
past
but
they
really
impressed
me
here
a
nice
sipper
that
seems
to
just
get
better
as
it
warms
d
very
enjoyable
experience
likely
my
favorite
barleywine
overall
there
are
so
many
different
flavors
in
this
beer
that
it
is
easy
to
miss
one
or
two
maybe
even
a
bit
too
complex
especially
compared
to
my
favorite
barley
wine
the
sam
smiths
golden
that
one
is
less
complex
one
can
easily
name
the
ingredients
and
much
more
balanced
as
usual
a
simple
beer
with
a
very
long
history
beats
the
beer
that
is
newer
and
overdone
in
ingredients
brewed
just
to
be
complex
but
dont
misunderstand
me
it
is
still
a
very
very
good
barley
wine
a
little
thinner
than
expected
but
this
aids
in
drinkability
easy
to
sip
and
actually
rather
clean
in
the
finish
no
tart
or
off
flavors
this
was
a
real
decent
one
good
for
cold
night
drinkability
these
days
i
prefer
the
english
over
american
styles
mostly
because
of
the
more
malty
and
estery
attack
rather
than
some
of
the
superhopped
barley
wines
and
this
is
certainly
the
former
quality
quality
stuff
tons
of
flavor
with
a
good
visceral
spiciness
which
makes
this
one
more
of
a
sipper
than
many
i
wish
i
could
find
this
more
often
nice
balanced
with
sweet
alcohol
and
earthy
malts
pretty
sweet
with
the
fruit
notes
from
the
aroma
coming
into
play
nice
hop
presence
which
is
severely
lacking
in
many
examples
of
this
style
hints
of
vanilla
caramel
cherry
grape
and
other
light
fruit
with
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
poured
out
of
the
refrigerator
into
a
point
glass
appearance
is
very
attractive
a
deep
bold
red
that
glows
in
the
light
surprisingly
clear
too
smells
like
a
standard
barley
wine
with
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
overpowering
any
hop
presence
initial
taste
is
sharp
bold
sweet
strong
and
intense
finishes
with
a
feint
smokiness
that
pleases
the
palate
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavors
blend
together
nicely
a
good
barleywine
worth
having
again
sneaky
alcohol
of
course
but
maybe
a
bit
low
for
a
barleywine
very
tasty
and
great
to
marvel
at
overall
impression
i
was
turned
off
to
the
anchor
brewery
even
as
a
rhode
islander
who
of
course
must
be
infatuated
with
anchors
i
had
their
porter
a
long
time
ago
when
i
wasnt
that
into
beer
this
was
a
gamble
for
me
as
i
had
a
bad
memory
affiliation
with
the
label
im
glad
i
found
this
though
delicious
it
isnt
too
dark
as
i
find
most
of
the
beers
i
like
are
this
is
a
welcome
change
it
is
beautiful
to
look
at
important
to
me
and
it
is
a
beautiful
experience
to
drink
it
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
only
bought
one
as
a
taster
but
will
definitely
buy
more
soon
and
i
have
changed
my
position
on
the
brewery
more
anchors
please
i
guess
4
months
can
make
a
difference
much
smoother
and
alcohol
has
eased
down
some
still
retains
all
the
great
flavors
mentioned
before
i
would
give
it
an
a
based
on
the
aged
tasting
overall
im
happily
underwhelmed
with
this
beer
i
was
preparing
myself
for
a
kick
in
the
mouth
but
found
it
to
be
a
much
more
subdued
version
of
the
style
im
gonna
get
another
one
a
stash
it
for
a
year
or
two
and
give
it
another
go
bottle
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malts
sweet
potato
molassess
cinnamon
and
allspice
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
but
perhaps
not
as
sweet
lots
of
caramel
malt
and
sweet
potato
complex
but
not
really
that
good
also
quite
hard
to
drink
meh
d
as
a
barleywine
this
is
obviously
a
sipper
its
got
a
solid
malt
backbone
which
is
complemented
nicely
by
a
slightly
above
average
hop
content
for
an
english
bw
i
actually
like
the
additional
hops
i
like
sweet
but
balanced
this
was
pretty
darn
good
ill
have
it
again
overall
drinkability
a
classic
to
appreciate
time
and
time
again
this
is
the
stuff
bold
but
not
too
heavy
an
alloccasion
barleywine
which
goes
down
easy
but
retains
its
character
throughout
overall
about
14
through
the
bottle
hits
you
wthe
classic
alcohol
light
warming
sensation
very
tasty
and
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
not
the
most
extreme
but
a
classic
and
timetested
tribute
to
the
english
barleywine
style
drinkability
why
sure
ill
take
another
d
this
bottle
is
around
68
months
old
presuming
it
was
new
when
i
bought
it
overall
a
nonoffensive
offering
however
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
syrupy
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
but
it
isnt
bad
and
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
md
throughout
the
drink
not
a
little
trace
of
alc
is
detected
on
my
tongue
it
drinks
just
silky
smooth
and
fine
on
the
carbonation
more
in
line
with
a
wellbalanced
english
barley
wine
than
its
american
heavily
hopped
counterparts
the
hops
are
used
in
such
a
skill
that
a
balance
overall
is
beautifully
showcased
albeit
without
surprising
flavours
or
the
wow
effect
quite
different
from
f
tasted
alongside
this
barley
wine
is
far
lighter
and
easier
to
enjoy
taste
was
thick
sweet
and
rather
cloying
seemed
to
lack
carbonation
or
something
but
this
one
was
just
too
thick
and
sweet
d
i
like
it
but
the
sweetness
is
a
little
cloying
a
nice
try
at
the
barleywine
but
id
rather
have
old
guardian
or
backburner
etc
beer
pours
a
nice
mahogany
color
decent
head
to
it
moderate
lacing
odd
aroma
to
it
definitely
get
a
huge
whiff
of
chocolate
more
than
most
chocolate
stouts
ive
tried
and
some
raisinplum
smells
first
impression
on
the
taste
is
the
hotness
of
the
alcohol
wow
this
is
like
a
mixed
drink
not
saying
i
dont
like
it
but
this
is
like
dfh
120
min
territory
a
little
on
the
thin
bodied
side
which
is
surprising
lots
of
flavors
going
on
mostly
getting
that
chocolate
though
which
i
just
never
expected
to
be
getting
from
a
barley
wine
tastes
a
little
out
of
balance
to
me
too
just
too
much
going
on
interesting
to
try
and
it
will
definitely
leave
you
pretty
buzzed
i
was
expecting
better
to
be
honest
though
ive
had
a
lot
better
barley
wines
but
this
one
gets
points
for
being
different
i
guess
this
is
in
no
way
a
hop
bomb
like
sn
reminds
me
more
of
brooklyns
monster
ale
drinking
my
other
bottle
of
the
08
vintage
the
nose
is
very
floral
rose
hips
sherry
toffee
burnt
sugar
a
little
nutty
as
well
the
palate
is
quite
fruity
but
also
has
quite
an
array
of
caramelized
sugar
notes
burnt
sugar
brown
sugar
vanilla
sugar
toffee
and
caramel
still
very
fruity
this
has
aged
quite
gracefully
with
plums
raisins
and
figs
present
very
nice
43
54
maybe
a
bad
batch
or
maybe
needs
more
aging
well
see
fairly
low
in
abv
and
with
the
restrained
flavor
quite
drinkable
poured
into
a
non
chilled
goblet
from
tap
color
is
a
bright
mahogany
hue
beaneath
a
cream
colored
head
minimal
retention
and
less
lacing
from
the
head
smells
are
of
malts
figs
and
raisin
the
taste
was
quite
complex
more
than
expected
it
was
sweet
with
a
tartlike
hop
bitterness
underneath
caramel
fruits
and
malts
add
nice
balance
to
the
alcohol
and
hops
this
ones
pretty
medium
bodied
without
too
much
carbonation
as
far
as
drinkability
it
scores
well
for
the
style
this
went
down
smooth
and
easy
very
enjoyable
and
the
best
widely
available
barley
wine
ive
had
very
nice
aroma
of
apricot
and
raisin
the
color
is
hazy
amberruby
there
is
a
very
sweet
and
malty
raisin
taste
from
the
beginning
that
stays
pretty
consistent
until
the
finish
when
a
very
mild
hoppiness
comes
in
there
is
the
typical
anchor
bitterness
in
the
aftertatste
but
it
is
joined
by
a
much
too
sweet
and
syrupy
feel
in
the
mouth
d
a
classic
that
still
stands
out
as
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
can
only
imagine
how
shocking
this
must
have
been
to
american
tastebuds
in
1975

some

not
a

taste
echoes
this
not
hoppy
at
all
for
an
american
bwine
lots
of
sweet
malt
with
a
sharp
twang
near
the
back
palate
a
bit
on
the
boozey
side
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
slick
and
only
moderately
cloying
seems
a
lot
less
chewy
than
a
lot
of
other
barleywines
id
put
this
one
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
regardless
a
nice
little
sipper
cheers
as
others
have
said
an
expensive
6
pack
something
like
18
not
something
to
buy
often
but
a
good
one
to
have
in
your
collection
ages
well
i
havent
had
too
many
barleywines
before
but
anchor
is
one
of
my
top
breweries
easy
drinking
big
head
quickly
fades
to
nothing
its
good
but
i
wish
there
was
more
hops
i
feel
like
bigfoot
had
more
to
it
it
might
be
me
but
im
not
getting
to
much
from
the
aroma
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
a
nice
english
style
barleywine
that
goes
down
easy
but
has
nice
smooth
flavors
d
basic
run
of
the
mill
barleywine
a
decent
brew
but
not
a
standout
poured
a
reddish
copper
with
large
white
head
that
took
forever
to
die
a
yeasty
funky
malt
smell
of
caramel
and
other
sugary
sweetness
leads
to
a
bit
of
woodiness
mixed
with
some
floral
grassy
hops
also
smooth
and
creamy
mixed
w
hop
bitterness
that
leads
to
a
dry
warming
beer
abv
makes
itself
known
that
has
sweet
tastes
as
well
as
some
fruit
flavors
a
little
rough
as
not
completely
balanced
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
overall
this
brew
is
a
little
too
cloying
and
sweet
for
me
the
best
barley
wines
have
a
strong
hop
presence
to
balance
the
sweetness
check
out
southern
tier
back
burner
three
floyds
blonde
behemoth
or
sierra
nevada
bigfoot
instead
of
this
its
okay
but
not
something
i
would
frequently
come
back
to
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
good
for
a
bw
i
could
see
drinking
more
then
1
in
a
sitting
overall
this
is
one
boozy
beer
and
quite
a
sipper
very
filling
this
will
be
my
only
one
of
the
night
but
i
will
definitely
have
another
some
time
soon
its
good
but
hard
to
drink
fast
definately
a
sipper
big
mouthfeel
almost
chewy
gets
a
thin
creamy
foam
in
the
mouth
shared
it
with
the
wife
enjoyed
it
but
between
the
alcohol
the
sweetness
i
dont
know
if
i
could
finish
a
bottle
on
my
own
funny
not
a
whole
lot
of
mouthcoating
aftertaste
12oz

a
syrupy
brown
with
some
red
hues

held

remarkable

sweet

brown
sugar

mouthfeel

tastes
are

caramel
cane

raisins
slight
hop
bitterness
for
some
balance
with
hints
of
cinnamon
on
the
finish
still
very
sweet
overall
i
liked
this
barleywine
but
one
was
enough
worth
the
try
but
it
wasnt
a
favorite
of
mine
d
very
drinkable
a
delicous
beer
its
a
nice
evening
sipper
for
sure
i
am
becoming
quite
fond
of
the
old
foghorn
and
will
be
sitting
on
some
of
this
for
awhile
now
its
still
really
a
hot
brew
at
this
point
but
you
can
almost
imagine
how
good
it
can
be
taste
is
of
toased
malt
burnt
sugar
raisins
caramel
toffee
with
a
citrusy
hop
finish
pretty
much
tastes
like
it
smells
barleywines
are
generally
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
verdict
old
foghorn
is
truly
a
great
beer
and
its
clear
why
it
has
been
brewed
for
over
thirty
years
like
a
boozy
rich
desert
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
afterdinner
contemplation
if
youre
looking
for
a
starting
point
for
exploring
the
world
of
barleywines
this
would
be
an
excellent
choice
d
fairly
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
id
definitely
like
to
sample
this
again
drinkability
really
wish
i
could
buy
six
packs
of
this
i
was
a
little
scared
when
i
saw
the
average
score
but
after
trying
this
yet
again
i
was
very
happy
this
is
not
a
massive
barley
wine
rather
one
that
focuses
on
balance
and
subtlety
i
think
this
barleywine
is
just
gorgeous
great
job
anchor
d
low
its
a
slow
sipper
which
means
i
cant
handle
more
than
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
and
its
just
too
damn
cloying
to
take
even
that
it
has
a
lot
of
potential
but
it
would
benefit
from
toning
down
the
sweetness
and
round
out
the
flavor
a
bit
to
avoid
fatiguing
the
taste
buds
i
guess
thats
my
problem
with
the
style
if
i
want
a
dipa
ill
skip
averys
hog
heaven
and
have
an
averys
maharaja
if
i
want
a
belgian
strong
dark
ill
skip
the
old
foghorn
and
have
a
chimay
blue
and
if
i
want
a
monster
ill
have
an
arrogant
bastard
and
skip
the
bigfoot
its
not
that
any
of
these
barleywines
are
terrible
i
just
dont
understand
them

most
definitely
an
american

of

and
one
which
truly
served
to
revive
the
style
this
one
would
probably
do
well
with
a
little
time
in
the
cellar
to
help
tone
down
the
hops
overall
quite
good
drinkability
overall
not
terrible
but
the
level
of
sweet
and
the
syrupy
nature
takes
away
here
not
to
mention
the
alcohol
im
wondering
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
its
supposed
to
be
like
this
sweet
and
syrupy
sounds
a
little
off
to
me
d
starts
out
very
easily
drinkable
and
only
improves
as
it
edges
to
cellar
temperature
becomes
sweeter
still
toward
room
temp
and
isnt
something
youd
want
a
large
quantity
of
d
quite
a
drinkable

old

running
with
notes

a
boozy

of
sherry
and
rum
as
the
hops
and
ethanol
battle
it

on
the
back
of
the
palate
good
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
perhaps
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
still
solid
fairly
drinkable
and
i
can
see
how
this
would
do
well
with
some
age
it
it
one
of
the
originals
anchor
brewing
company
rarely
disappoints
and
of
is
no
exception
i
havent
given
up
on
it
completely
but
this
stuff
is
expensive
relative
to
other
guaranteed
favorites
very
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
decent

caramel
malt
bread
and
dark
fruits
dominate
the
aroma
sticky
mouthfeel
lots
of
caramel
and
vanilla
up

which
is
joined
by
the
sugary
fruits
towards
the
back
true
to
its
form
without
being
a
sticky
grainy
alcohol
bomb
not
as
delicious
as
a

but
a
nice
fruity
version
try

barleywine
day
this
past
saturday
translucent
through
the
glass
a
very
beautiful
amber
color
a
finger
and
a
half
head
that
goes
away
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
that
of
fruit
sugar
maybe
a
little
wood
the
taste
is
the
same
too
but
with
a
little
bread
on
the
tail
end
goes
down
smooth
and
very
drinkable
maybe
i
hadnt
had
enough
to
eatdrink
beforehand
but
this
hit
a
little
harder
than
what
i
thought
to
be
honest
this
is
my
very
first
barleywine
so
i
have
no
prejudices
or
anything
and
maybe
i
am
completely
wrong
about
it
but
if
this
is
what
barleywines
taste
like
then
i
am
a
very
strong
believer
because
this
thing
is
delicious
on
tap
at
mcnellies
mahogany
pour
smells
hoppy
and
malty
taste
is
sheer
bliss
sweet
malt
hoppy
but
not
too
bittervery
flavorful
and
really
complex
all
i
can
say
is
wow
this
is
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
barleywine
will
have
to
try
this
one
out
again
from
a
bottle
to
compare
i
prefer
this
to
bigfoot
since
thirst
is
still
everything
at
least
in
line
with
my
sprite
motif
ill
say
id
definitely
drink
another
one
maybe
even
two
but
writing
home
about
it
i
probably
wouldnt
do
d
this
beer
started
out
really
well
the
aromas
and
initial
flavors
made
me
crave
more
but
it
all
quickly
unraveled
in
my
experience
it
was
like
the
beer
fell
apart
in
my
mouth
before
i
say
anything
too
definitive
about
this
beer
fitting
or
not
to
the
style
i
definitely
want
to
try
some
more
american
barleywines
i
would
recommend
more
balanced
brews
from
anchor
that
ive
enjoyed
before
id
recommend
this
one
though
a
tasty
barleywine
but
not
quite
as
bold
as
its
california
brethren
d
not
a
bad
barelywine
not
the
best
showing
from
anchor
brewing
in
my
opinion
had
at
the
toronado
barleywine
festival
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
the
worst
of
the
ones
we
tried
i
love
anchor
as
an
awesome
brewery
but
this
was
overly
sweet
not
enough
character
and
the
nose
was
borderline
offensive
bitter
but
no
hop
character
i
have
discovered
this
is
probably
not
my
favorite
style
full
bodied
with
dialed
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beauty
of
a
sipper
and
true
to
the
style
definetely
recommend
this
fine
ale
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
fresh
hoppy
to
the
hilt
sn
bigfoot
of
the
other
style
bw
drinkability
is
interesting
its
a
sipper
for
sure
but
its
complex
enough
for
me
to
pick
it
up
again
dok
i
am
not
really
impressed
by
this
beer
despite
its
lower
abv
it
was
one
of
the
harsher
barlywines
ive
tasted
as
far
as
a
rough
alcohol
flavor
a
pretty
average
beer
overall
fairly
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
easier
ones
for
the
style
not
a
very
strong
alcohol
taste
for
the
8
abv
the
flavors
are
not
as
big
as
i
had
hoped
but
this
made
it
easier

drink

for

to
truly
rate
this
beer
because
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
barleywines
but
from
the
stuff
ive
read
about
the
style
this
one
seemed
to
be
pretty
decent
it
definitely
had
a
strong
alcohol
taste
that
lingered
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
i
would
said
that
overall
i
enjoyed
it
but
felt
that
much
of
the
flavor
seemed
to
be
overtaken

one

that
scares
me
into
thinking
this
will
be
one
of
those
sweet
barleywines
that
i
dont
enjoy
much
flavour
does
follow
the
aroma
maybe
citrusy
the
taste
was
an
explosion
of
fruit
i
wanna
say
very
berryish
and
a
beer
and
im
also
getting
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
it
is
of
tamed
malty
sweetness
balanced
with
some
noticable
but
not
over
the
top
hops
upon
swallowing
the
fruity
esters
make
their
presence
known
and
the
tamed
malty
sweetness
amps
it
up
a
notch
but
its
hard
to
complain
about
its
smooth
texture
and
sweet
flavor
while
not
a
sipper
for
one
with
a
little
licorice
after
taste
goes
down
fine
i
might
have
a
second
ginger
and
raisins
also
some
bready
malts

is
a
rather

a

anyone
know
what
malt
they
use

how
they
mash
the

resigned

love
barley

and
was
seriously
disappointed
with

i
had
it
on
tap
twice
and
just
didnt
get
it
its
a
bit
lighter
in
color
than
most
bws
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
too
sweet

you
to
all

with

the

has
seemed
to
put

with

christmas
i
like
her
a
lot
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
my
liking
and
doesnt
have
much
depth
overall
i
just
picked
up
the
freshly
bottled
newer
batch
of
this
so
i
figured
it
was
time
to
open
this
one
up
such
a
rich
and
heavy
beer
and
i
think
some
of
that
robust
body
doesnt
allow
any
nuances
to
shine
through
the
front
is
very
inviting
and
complex
but
once
those
malt
and
bourbon
characteristics
really
pick
up
this
gets
a
little
too
heavy
overall
though
very
enjoyable
wow
what
an
amazing
beer
i
open
this
and
take
a
smell
and
its
a
kick
right
in
the
nose
of
bourbon
the
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
bourbon
with
also
a
nice
amount
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
this
beer
gets
more
boozy
the
more
it
warms
up
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
be
amazing
aged
trust
me
this
is
a
big
beer
that
is
worth
the
hunt
o
guys
can
you
tell
this
one
was
aged
in
a
barrel
flavors
of
caramel
syrup
light
traces
of
bourbon
heat
and
woodiness
that
blends
well
with
the
big
malt
presence
aftertaste
lingers
nicely
bits
of
fried
plantain
in
caramel
syrup
and
earthy
tobacco
woodiness
rich
and
full
bodied
this
is
surely
a
slow
sipper
much
improved
over
the
base
barleywine
in
my
opinion
recommended
o
big
bourbon
bomb
really
enjoyable
could
use
some
more
time
to
mellow
out
but
enjoyed
every
sip

this
dumb

dark

like
most
barleywines
youll
see
scent
is
a
bit
boozy
which
overpowers
the
slight
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
taste
is
a
bit
hot
on
the
first
sip
then
it
smooths
out
and
continues
to
as
it
warms
rich
dark
fruits
with
toffee
brown

definitely
vanilla

of

thoroughly
enjoyable
however
would
have
liked
to
see
just
a

in
the
flavors
regardless
a
great
choice
for
one
of
the
first
three
ba
offerings
from
pipeworks
o
im
a
bit
torn
by
this
beer
there
are
some
aspects
of
it
i
liked
greatly
such
as
the
bourbon
characteristics
without
the
bourbon
booziness
but
others
like
the
overt
sweetness
not
so
much
still
a
pretty
good
beer
though
lacks
the
balance
necessary
for
such
high
alcohol
content
yet
still
a
great
ideaproduct
unbelievable
beer
like
drinking

hot
boozy

dark

which
is
expected
not
much

2010
vintage
i
consider
myself
lucky
to
have
found
this
at
a
store
only
several
months
ago
i
can
imagine
this
being
too
hot
when
fresh
but
nearly
five
years
of
aging
have
given
this
beer
wow
factor
this
seems
like
a
fortified
wine
which
might
work
for
some
and
du
finitely
not
for
others
i
liked
the
complex
flavors
but
did
grow
weary
of
the
sweetness
eventually
a
half
pour
or
sharing
may
be
the
way
to
go
i
assume
a
newer
release
would
show
its
alcohol
more
maybe
a
bit
less
sweet
also
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
booze
bomb
avery
always
does
it
right
toffee
caramels
sugarsweetness
and
alcohol
fire
overall
words
like
spectacular
exceptional
fantastic
incredible
awesome
outstanding
etc
dont
do
this
beer
justice
it
is
quite
simply
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
definitely
need
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
to
age
im
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
but
his
beer
is
way
too
sweet
it
completly
overpowers
any
other
flavors
and
makes
the
beer
hard
to
enjoy
a
couple
of
sips
and
you
are
done
way
too
sweet
in
order
for
me
to
fully
enjoy
the
nose
was
amazing
with
hints
of
oak
and
caramel
but
the
taste
was
a
let
down
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
though
as
it
did
not
overwhelm
the
drinker
for
such
a
huge
beer
with
the
march
2014
release
looks
good
smells
good
but
waaaay
too
sweet
for
me
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
and
upset
that
i
paid
so
much
for
a
single
bottle
of
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
like
butterscotch
and
caramel
perhaps
some
appley
oak
taste
is
very
sweet
almost
creme
brulee
sweet
buttery
apples
and
cranberries
caramel
brown
sugar
hint
of
oak
perhaps
this
is
par
for
the
course
for
an
english
barleywine
doubt
it
after
experiencing
bcbbw
but
it
was
very
sweet
with
not
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
i
was
extremely
excited
to
get
this
beer
i
was
extremely
let
down
when
i
drank
this
beer
this
should
be
some
sort
of
flavored
malt
or
gimmick
drink
it
is
not
a
beer
and
no
way
in
hell
is
this
a
barley
wine
it
tastes
like
half
the
bottle
is
pancake
syrup
it
is
so
sweet
i
split
half
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
friend
and
we
both
struggled
to
finish
it
the
2014
brew
clocks
in
at
14
8
and
for
the
exuberant
amount
of
money
they
charge
for
this
beer
it
is
a
huge
let
down
dont
let
curiosity
kill
your
wallet
it
is
not
worth
it

overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
had
some
pretty
nice
flavors
going
on
but
it
seemed
like
for
every
good
aspect
there
was
a
bad
one
and
that
just
held
this
beer
back
from
being
a
standout
for
the
style
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
wasnt
the
smoothest
it
was
warming
not
crisp
syrupy
sticky
fairly
cloying
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
of
holding
my
attention
but
the
sweetness
didnt
half
the
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
i
might
struggle
to
make
it
through
a
whole
one
just
because
of
the
sweetness
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
malty
caramel
flavors
and
the
nice
flavors
and
aromas
that
oak
imparted
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
sweetness
it
was
just
way
to
sweet
for
me
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
think
i
would
attempt
to
cellar
one
to
see
how
it
ages
and
if
any
of
that
sweetness
fades
away
over
time
i
would
only
recommend
this
to
people
who
enjoy
really
sweet
and
really
strong
beers
all
in
all
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
i
just
found
it
to
be
pretty
rough
around
the
edges
but
it
did
have
some
really
nice
flavors
and
aromas
to
it
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
from
or
avery
or
my
favorite
of
the
style
it
falls
in
the
middle
in
both
aspects
i
appreciate
the
effort
it
took
to
make
a
big
beer
like
this
but
the
super
high
sweetness
just
isnt
for
me
better
luck
next
time
guys
a
drain
pour
tried
to
let
get
room
temp
made
it
through
about
half
just
way
to
sweet
almost
over
powering
sugar
malty
and
very
strong
a
great
sipping
beer
and
great
on
tap
the
aroma
was
awesome
thats
about
all
i
can
say
good
though
this
was
my
first
ever
drain
pour
just
way
way
too
sweet
for
me
overall
the
texture
is
very
rich
and
satisfying
just
the
fact
that
the
flavors
are
a
mess
and
a
jumble
detracts
from
the
overall
experience
this
beer
is
not
drinkable
and
very
disappointing
as
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
avery
and
love
many
of
their
beers
immensely
i
highly
recommend
avoiding
this
one
while
this
hadestempting
offering
may
be
a
bit
young
all
the
better
eh
beelzebub
at
this
point
in
time
its
still
a
pungent
palatepunching
mouthful
the
thing
is
other
than
the
lurking
erupting
alcohol
heat
i
cant
imagine
the
rest
of
this
changing
all
that
much
after
any
amount
of
longterm
aging
and
thats
why
i
dont
feel
bad
about
having
opened
it
now
medium
full
body
medium
low
carbonation
warming
with
some
hot
to
solventy
fusel
alcohols
on
the
finish
fresh
bottle
sampled
in
oct
2014
was
too
sweet
and
significantly
less
enjoyable
especially
in
quantity
o
you
might
as
well
buy
a
fifth
of
spirits
because
this
is
not
a
very
interesting
beer
to
try
way
too
much
booziness
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
adding
to
any
complexity
my
guess
is
that
this
would
improve
with
a
lot
of
time
so
it
may
very
well
need
to
be
cellared
o
i
was
shocked
to
see
the
low
ratings
for
this
brew
dont
let
that
sway
you
this
stuff
is
great
the
almost
complete
lack
of
bitterness
makes
this
somewhat
unlike
a
beer
closer
to
a
port
wine
or
sherry
like
liquid
candy
in
a
glass
with
a
kick
overall
as
the
guy
before
me
mentioned
i
find
this
one
to
be
rated
fairly
low
i
see
how
people
could
find
this
a
little
too
sweet
but
there
are
plenty
flavors
to
be
savored
underneath
the
sweetness
this
is
the
strongest
beer
ive
had
and
expected
it
to
be
boozier
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
12
oz
snifter
i
was
pleased
with
this
one
good
job
avery
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
actually
surprised
to
see
its
ratings
here
as
i
think
they
are
low
it
is
a
sweet
beer
and
that
my
be
surprising
for
some
but
along
with
the
sweet
it
has
strong
and
layered
flavors
o
tasty
brew
but
tends
a
bit
sweet
for
my
palette
the
addition
of
some
more
hops
would
be
welcome
here
bit
sweet
and
more
than
a
bit
heavy
feels
a
bit
like
malt
liquor
but
theres
certainly
more
complex
sugars
there
to
be
enjoyed
tastes
sweet
sweet
sweet
dark
fruit
dipped
or
soaked
i
should
say
in
sugar
while
the
sweetest
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
do
enjoy
the
way
the
caramel
and
oak
work
together
the
alcohol
stays
more
well
hidden
than
i
figured
it
would
as
each
sip
brings
mostly
the
sweet
plummy
oak
flavors
while
the
hops
are
less
prominent
syrupy
you
may
enjoy
this
to
a
point
as
an
after
dinner
sipper
if
you
can
get
past
the
cloying
aspect
this
is
a
truly
phenomenal
beer
the
complexity
is
there
and
theres
so
much
to
explore
more
theres
some
really
interesting
characters
that
you
dont
expect
even
for
this
style
of
beer
even
more
still
it
manages
to
be
phenomenally
well
balanced
meaning
its
supremely
drinkable
despite
the
weight
i
genuinely
love
this
beerits
at
the
very
peak
of
the
craft
oi
like
sweet
beers
and
this
is
definitely
a
sweet
beer
so
it
gets
decent
marks
from
me
it
drinks
more
like
a
fortified
wine
or
port
than
perhaps
any
other
beer
i
have
ever
had
thus
it
makes
for
a
good
dessert
drink
if
you
are
ready
for
the
sweetness
and
are
into
sipping
and
sharing
but
i
dont
know
when
else
i
would
drink
this
overall
i
am
glad
its
only
a
12
oz
it
too
sweet
to
drink
too
much
i
enjoyed
it
though
overall
very
strong
and
flavorful
beer
on
the
edge
of
being
harsh
and
astringent
would
love
to
see
this
with
some
age
on
it
definitely
plan
on
taking
a
while
on
this
one
it
is
a
big
intense
beer
quite
boozy
and
exceptionally
sweet
i
can
see
why
theres
a
relatively
small
amount
of
beer
drinkers
this
appeals
to
i
do
think
its
pretty
good
though
o
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
complex
and
something
you
can
keep
tasting
and
finding
new
flavors
in
rarely
do
i
come
across
a
beer
i
cant
finish
but
this
was
one
of
them
maybe
i
just
am
not
accustomed
to
this
but
i
couldnt
do
it
there
were
hints
of
oak
in
the
taste
and
smell
but
sadly
the
turbinado
sugar
is
what
i
tasted
mostly
in
fact
the
whole
thing
tasted
like
sugar
too
much
sugar
this
could
have
been
good
if
they
would
just
have
toned
down
the
sugar
i
finished
maybe
a
quarter
of
it
and
could
not
go
one
further
in
fairness
i
am
sure
some
will
really
like
this
for
me
no
still
in
fairness
i
couldnt
give
a
flat
out
horrible
rating
this
beer
is
better
than
that
but
for
my
taste
it
just
didnt
cut
it
o
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
considering
that
age
very
glad
to
try
taste
is
sweet
with
the
expected
alcohol
burn
no
bitterness
except
for
the
alcohol
and
a
bit
syrupy
reading
lots
of
different
adjectives
from
everyone
here
and
applying
them
to
my
experience
seems
though
the
higher
ratings
are
for
bottles
which
have
aged
awhile
this
one
was
produced
only
9
months
ago
i
was
wondering
if
it
would
mellow
a
bit
sitting
in
the
bottle
for
awhile
otherwise
this
is
how
i
felt
about
it
appearance
was
standard
without
head
but
a
pretty
golden
color
the
aroma
was
fantastic
but
difficult
to
describe
the
taste
was
not
as
fantastic
and
was
also
difficult
to
describe
aside
from
the
alcohol
in
a
nutshell
this
is
a
blast
of
alcohol
and
considering
the
taste
of
this
young
version
better
to
blast
ya
into
buzzdom
than
to
appreciate
as
a
refined
source
of
leisure
it
definitely
beats
4loco
and
i
dont
think
there
is
a
hangover
associated
with
it
like
the
4loco
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
glass
batch

bottled
in
2005
pours
moderately
hazycloudy
dark

with
a
minimal

reduces

with

moderately
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
present
after
the

overall
this
is
an
awesome
english
barleywine
big
complexity
and
great
balance
of
malt
yeast
ester
and
oak
flavors
and
quite
smooth
sip
on
slowly
with
no
booziness
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
our
3rd
highest
average
score
of
the
12
brews
tasted
at

at

its
was
a
very
smooth
beer
4
15
score
o
a
decent
brew
nothing
too
exciting
and
not
something
id
be
willing
to
purchase
again
o
a
nice
beer
but
not
really
worth
the
price
tag
i
would
actually
rather
try
a
fresher
version
near
bottling
to
see
if
there
is
more
zip
this
one
seems
on
the
way
down
and
a
little
dead
overall
i
was
impressed
and
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
pretty
low
rated
it
could
be
due
to
people
not
sitting
on
it
for
a
little
while
causing
it
to
be
too
hot
i
think
it
could
have
benefited
from
another
few
months
of
aging
hopefully
there
are
some
left
somewhere
from
the
may
release
because
i
would
like
to
grab
another
so
i
dont
have
to
wait
another
5
months
and
lose
out
on
that
aging
time
very
unique
brendan
liked
it
more
than
me
and
would
put
it
in
his
top
5
i
would
say
its
worth
a
try
and
would
buy
again
but
not
often
due
to
the
price
o
a
good
brew
but
really
too
strong
a
12oz
bottle
ought
to
be
split
and
slowly
sipped
this
is
pretty
disgusting
dont
drink
one
thats
6
and
a
half
years
old
smells
like
sugarcane
husks
salt
and
soy
sauce
tastes
kinda
medicinal
and
annoyingly
sweet
dont
do
it
please
just
dont
stop
now
dont
please
please
please
please
please
please
please
please
please
dont
overall
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
pushes
the
envelope
it
will
probably
take
you
out
of
your
comfort
zone
its
a
quality
experience
but
know
what
youre
getting
yourself
into
on
the
high
end
of
medium
bodied
low
level
of
carbonation
this
is
going
to
take
me
some
time
to
finish
but
when
i
do
ill
be
satisfied
im
sure
nice
in
the
category
as
good
as
olde
school
i
like
insanity
a
bit
better
due
to
the
barrel
flavor
o
really
love
it
though
i
understand
how
some
would
not
o
i
like
strong
drinks
but
this
is
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
alcohol
to
enjoy
a
full
bottle
solo
i
can
imagine
sharing
this
with
a
friend
and
enjoying
it
but
taking
down
a
whole
bottle
at
one
sitting
by
oneself
is
a
daunting
task
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
this
is
a
serious
sipper
o
i
am
very
impressed
by
how
they
made
a
fairly
tasty
interesting
beer
with
so
much
alcohol
my
favorite
beers
are
lambics
which
are
almost
always
between
4
and
6
i
usually
wouldnt
buy
a
wine
over
14
abv
and
generally
prefer
wine
that
is
roughly
12
5
so
this
beer
is
very
much
out
of
my
comfort
zone
the
hot
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
and
the
beer
is
complex
and
very
sippable
bravo
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
small
quickly
dissipating
white
head
aroma
of
caramel
malt
oak
and
vanilla
esters
very
fruity
brown
sugar
mild
sweet
spices
and
sweet
alcohol
brandy
like
aroma
taste
same
as
aroma
palate
is
a
full
body
sweet
spices
and
alcohol
the
finish
is
sweet
caramel
vanilla
yeast
and
fruity
flavors
some
oak
and
vanilla
tones
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
the
ending
is
mildly
spiced
with
some
sweet
alcohol
this
brew
seems
to
have
some
a
bit
of
bourbon
and
brandy
notes
a
bit
rough
at
the
beginning
but
drinkable
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
taste
this
is
actually
our
first
taste
of
the
demon
series
and
it
certainly
did
not
disappoint
samael
brought
it
hard
to
the
palate
with
massive
bready
sweetness
nicely
matched
oakiness
and
strong
booziness
through
the
end
of
the
sip
while
things
may
have
not
been
the
most
balanced
and
concise
the
more
noticeable
inclusions
of
leather
light
smoke
and
plastics
were
happily
welcomed
to
the
party
integrating
pleasantly
amongst
the
general
strength
and
bigness
of
this
beer
things
calm
down
quite
a
bit
with
warmth
through
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
helping
to
keep
it
much
much
closer
to
style
and
approachable
this
guy
is
monstrous
and
considering
the
abv
alone
you
should
definitely
fight
off
the
darkness
with
some
friends
or
you
just
might
get
swallowed
up
in
it
one
more
of
this
vintage
in
the
cellar
overall
the
nose
was
quite
appealing
and
some
of
those
flavors
held
through
but
this
beer
might
just
be
too
big
for
its
own
good
o
id
pass
on
this
unless
you
intent
to
cellar
it
for
at
least
a
year
i
can
tell
there
is
potential
for
something
epic
but
you
need
to
give
this
guy
some
time
to
develop
the
flavor
is
overwhelming
even
as
a
sipper
this
should
be
poured
in
small
amounts
among
multiple
people
i
would
say
that
the
strength
and
body
almost
work
like
a
brandybourbon
i
recommend
this
for
a
cold
night
among
friends
o
good
drinkability
for
the
style
maltoriented
with
a
nice
oak
character
recommended
o
though
it
comes
in
a
small
bottle
this
bottle
is
really
intended
for
sharing
because
this
is
a
big
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
not
all
that
well
hidden
i
recommend
slowly
sipping
this
one
over
a
fairly
long
period
of
time
but
it
was
nice
on
a
cold
winter
evening
very
nice
amounts
of
complexity
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
english
barleywine
its
got
all
of
the
great
malty
sweetness
that
you
could
ask
for
the
hops
and
oak
are
a
bit
muted
possibly
due
to
age
but
i
think
it
might
also
be
due
to
the
higher
abv
the
heat
may
be
masking
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
at
the
finish
nevertheless
its
a
tasty
beer
and
very
drinkable
for
one
that
clocks
in
at
almost
15
5
this
is
the
last
of
the
demons
of
ale
that
ive
tasted
and
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
them
all
they
were
truly
an
experience
very
little
alcohol
heat
for
such
a
high
abv
brew
amazing
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
super
sweet
almost
to
the
point
of
cloying
the
wood
was
bold
and
mellow
at
the
same
time
and
gave
a
very
nice
aftertaste
so
i
was
wrong
surprised
at
how
drinkable
it
was
really
not
much
heat
at
all
im
sure
the
4
years
of
aging
had
a
lot
to
do
with
that
though
my
first
impression
was
that
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
sam
adams
utopias
in
smell
and
flavor
obviously
its
got
a
lower
abv
and
is
carbonated
so
thats
different
but
in
general
it
really
did
remind
me
of
drinking
utopias
wish
i
had
purchased
a
few
more
of
these
overall
excellent
i
love
the
level
of
the
bready
malts
and
the
sweetness
that
is
as
cloying
as
expected
the
alcohol
is
hidden
elegantly
o
criminally
underrated
if
you
live
in
california
you
can
probably
still
find
this
beer
but
its
old
and
trust
me
very
much
worth
your
money
and
time
looking
for
it
my
rating
is
going
to
be
a
bit
higher
just
because
i
feel
it
is
so
underrated
on
ba
o
decent
sipper
mouthfeel
aside
nothing
overwhelmingly
impressive
at
over
a
dollar
an
ounce
this
here
bottle
is
probably
my
last
o
i
like
it
not
too
familliar
with
barleywines
but
i
think
this
is
pretty
good
might
even
be
over
aged
since
it
is
only
14
abv
not
the
near
16
of
later
batches
first
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
impressed
with
how
well
hidden
the
abv
is
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
though
so
the
drinkability
didnt
become
too
dangerous
as
the
sweetness
slowed
me
down
the
overall
flavor
was
pretty
malty
but
had
some
nice
subtleties
like
the
vanilla
notes
that
snuck
through
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
was
a
bit
heavy
and
sweet
it
makes
a
solid
after
meal
drink
or
sipper
in
cold
months
overall
absolutely
insane
it
is
quite
a
beast
even
with
this
much
age
so
i
think
it
could
hold
up
to
45
more
years
for
the
very
patient
definitely
a
decadent
awesome
treat
o
i
contend
that
theres
no
difference
between
trying
something
fresh
before
something
aged
and
trying
something
aged
before
trying
it
fresh
with
that
said
this
is
a
good
bw
one
that
id
like
to
try
fresh
avery
brewing
company
continues
to
impress
i
have
liked
nearly
every
single
one
of
their
beers
that
i
have
tried
but
their
demons
of
ale
series
is
the
top
of
the
pack
and
samael
is
certainly
a
worthy
addition
to
the
pleasant
brutality
of
that
series
find
it
buy
it
drink
it
and
revel
in
the
brutality
cheers
o
let
me
start
by
saying
that
i
love
big
english
barleywines
i
think
there
is
no
better
way
to
finish
the
day
than
sipping
an
old
thomas
hardys
this
beer
is
great
for
the
style
it
is
sweet
caramel
candy
maybe
too
sweet
you
can
age
this
monster
for
years
it
is
a
sipper
but
i
was
not
willing
to
share
i
wanted
every
drop
for
myself
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
find
a
samael
put
it
away
for
a
decade
and
count
yourself
lucky
save
it
for
a
cold
winters
night
and
enjoy
the
beer
appears
sunburst
orange
perhaps
a
touch
of
ruby
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
offers
booze
malt
oak
tannic
citrus
the
flavor
is
definitely
smoother
than
the
fresh
bottle
i
had
a
few
years
ago
lots
of
oak
very
sweet
fine
for
sipping
but
an
ounce
or
two
is
plenty
eh
overall
almost
sickly
sweet
this
is
definitely
a
very
young
beer
that
needs
to
spend
another
23
years
in
the
bottle
at
least
to
be
more
enjoyable
i
am
disappointed
that
i
drank
one
of
my
bottles
now
as
i
feel
it
will
have
been
a
waste
compared
to
how
this
will
taste
further
down
the
road
hopefully
it
turns
out
to
be
worth
the
9bottle
price
tag
in
23
years
this
brew
poured
with
half
a
finger
of
white
head
that
dissipated
relatively
quickly
for
the
most
part
but
a
little
bit
hung
around
crowning
the
body
there
wasnt
any
lacing
left
on
the
glass
from
the
head
the
body
was
a
cloudy
mahogany
color
with
a
lot
of
active
carbonation
more
than
i
was
expecting
actually
the
nose
was
insanely
strong
and
overpowered
with
oak
other
things
that
i
got
on
the
nose
were
toffee
and
vanilla
and
a
crapload
of
booze
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
is
going
to
knock
me
on
my
ass
the
taste
started
with
sweet
toffee
then
vanilla
and
then
literally
beat
me
in
the
face
with
oak
and
finished
with
a
serious
booze
burn
the
body
was
towards
the
thick
and
syrupy
side
with
lighter
carbonation
than
i
expected
the
finish
was
long
with
a
lot
of
heat
honestly
all
this
beer
was
to
me
was
just
really
sweet
really
oakey
and
really
boozy
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
especially
from
a
brewery
that
i
love
and
definitely
not
worth
the
hefty
pricetag
one
final
note
even
when
aged
several
years
this
is
a
massive
beer
and
is
not
easy
to
drink
a
single
12oz
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
two
people
to
share
batch

slightly

this

where
the

is
most
noticeable
syruplike

but
not
too
overbearing
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
bought
it
about
6
months
ago
and
its
just
been
sitting
there
tonight
i
decided
was
the
night
ill
probably
grab
it
again
when
i
see
it
experiment
with
more
aging
this
though
is
pretty
good
after
18
months
big
big
big

throughout
the
taste
and
long
into
the

the
booze
is
like
a
punch
in
the
gut
its
high
low
on
carbonation
and
a
viscous
almost
syrupy
body
really
make
the
mouthfeel
smooth
and
comfortable
its
not
bad
overall
would
be
great
with
a
cigar
id
probably
still
buy
it
again
except
for
the
mystery
floaters
yeast
sediment
this
is
pretty
decent
high
abv
barley
wine
bold
and
assertive
across
the
board
yet
pretty
wellbalanced
overall
complexity
is
almost
an
understatement
with
this
beer
worth
checking
out
but
only
in
small
doses
overall
overall
it
is
sweet
flavorful
warming
and
delicious
this
is
definitely
one
to
sit
back
and
sip
over
a
long
conversation
with
a
friend
or
a
stranger
at
a
bar
that
can
become
a
friend
give
it
a
go
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
a
transcendent
creation
avery
take
a
bow
o
strange
beer
indeed
a
powerhouse
of
booze
that
remains
drinkable
all
while
being
a
sugary
maltbomb
if
it
werent
for
that
startling
lemon
taste
i
think
i
might
like
it
more
but
for
now
im
glad
i
only
got
one
bottle
for
around
9
bottle
from
the
shop
this
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
pretty
much
no
head
aroma
is
plenty
of
harsh
booze
caramel
dark
fruity
raisins
this
was
hard
to
finish
heavy
warming
alcohol
with
extreme
oak
flavor
roasted
grain
and
maybe
some
rancid
raisin
flavor
the
oak
was
just
so
heavy
as
to
be
totally
unpleasant
for
me
i
appreciate
what
was
going
on
here
being
big
and
all
but
unable
to
finish
a
12ouncer
myself
o
this
was
a
surprise
because
i
thought
the
big
alcohol
content
would
be
more
prominent
in
the
taste
but
the
massive
sweetness
really
keeps
it
mellow
its
a
big
strong
sweet
beer
as
the
beer
warmed
up
i
did
not
find
much
change
from
the
initial
aspects
i
can
see
that
this
brew
might
be
a
bit
much
for
one
person
but
being
shared
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
o
a
nice
effort
not
something
id
look
for
every
day
but
a
unique
barleywine
style
ale
that
was
a
pleasant
way
to
wind
down
an
evening
i
would
purchase
this
again
3
5
d
this
is
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
me
but
it
was
worth
a
try
however
it
is
certainly
not
a
terrible
beer
either
if
you
want
your
eyebrows
to
light
on
fire
and
like
to
be
punched
in
the
face
with
a
fist
made
out
of
soft
caramel
candy
that
has
been
rolled
around
in
oak
chips
than
this
is
the
brew
for
you
body
is
thick
and
syrupy
creamy
and
sweet
with
very
intense
flavors
so
much
so
it
reminded
me
strongly
of
colorado
whiskies
stranahans
and
high
west
double
rye
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
they
used
strananhans
barrelschips
this
tasted
very
similar
anything
more
than
a
tiny
sip
and
you
feel
an
alcohol
burn
its
certainly
potent
at
16
took
quite
awhile
to
finish
the
small
glass
but
it
was
definitely
savored
o
could
have
been
very
good
but
unfortunately
this
one
has
started
to
turn
i
will
probably
try
another
from
my
stash
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
just
a
bad
bottle
great
complexity
and
smooth
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
over
the
top
o
among
the
best
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
well
balanced
abv
which
makes
a
fine
brew
worth
seeking
d
definitely
a
sipper
if
you
want
to
endure
it
bordering
undrinkable
on
account
of
how
sweet
and
alcoholic
it
is
id
never
have
it
again
high
d
o
quite
a
sweet
beer
boozy
and
unique
to
have
such
an
old
beer
5
years
not
overly
mind
blowing
but
good
def
for
desert
and
worth
a
try
glad
i
got
this
one
stored
away
back
then
o
a
fun
beer
to
sip
on
but
i
dont
see
how
anyone
could
handle
more
than
a
mini
snifter
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
oak
and
the
citrusy
flavors
came
together
well
enough
in
it
it
definitely
made
me
think
fresh
peeled
oranges
on
more
than
one
occasion
it
did
however
also
feel
a
little
harsh
and
unrefined
at
times
with
the
oak
and
citrus
flavors
clashing
a
little
the
oak
is
barely
enough
to
contain
the
beast
a
truly
titanic
english
barleywine
drinkable
the
16
is
apparent
bit
not
an
impediment
o
maybe
a
bit
past
its
prime
but
still
very
interesting
to
try
definitely
a
sweet
one
but
great
flavor
remains

i

this

fresh
glad
i
didnt

out
9
bones
for

its
better
than
the
beast
and
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
to
see
how
it
compares
overall
some
nice
flavours
but
it
is
just
too
strong
not
really
sure
what
the
benefit
of
such
a
high
abv
is
i
like
english
barleywines
a
lot
and
like
strong
beers
but
maybe
this
would
be
more
enjoyable
at
a
nice
sedate

overall
a
great
dessert
beer
its
a
bit
cloying
couldnt
have
more
than
one
given
the
abv

expected
more
alcohol
dominance
but
it
was
not
there
great
malt
complexity
given
the
age
and
still
a
touch
of
bitterness
for

glad
i
have
more

i
love

but
the
booziness
combined
with
the
sweet

are
almost
a

for
me
with

im
glad

and
it
was
pricey
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
overall
i
quite
enjoy
this
but
its
not
amazing
ive
never
had
this
beer
fresh
so
i
cant
comment
on
the
effect
of
seven
years

its
still

really
like

but
had
to
drink
it
slowly
the
high
abv
makes
this
somewhat
of
a
challenge
to
drink
but
it
tastes
good
o
yes
i
saw
right
off
that
this
was
an
english
bw
it
wasnt
too
hoppy
and
was
rather
understated
in
that
regard
additionally
the
malt
bit
was
caramellike
and
very
flavorful
i
can
almost
envision
the
brewer
wringing
out
a
log
made
of
oak
every
day
into
the
brew
kettle
until
the
beer
was
about
45
oak
35
pure

19
malt
and
1
hop
really
wonderful
and
special
when
one
considers
the
seamless

the
overall
taste
profile
really
knocks
my
socks
off
i
adore
the
cognac
note
and
am
totally
down
for
serious
love
with
a
good
stilton
overall
very
good
beer
but
not
overall
impressed
it
appears
that
if
you
want
just
alcohol
and
not
beer
this
one
is
for
you
i
am
not
knocking

impression
after

in
this
same
demons

series
last
fall
i
just
had
to
try
this
guy
a
nice
barleywine
but
has
way
too
much
alcohol
and
booze
present
if
they
dumbed
this
down
to
10
on
the
abvs
it
may
be
well
rounded
and
appropriate
for
the
style
glad
i
tried
this
but
would
like
to
share
22oz750ml
barleywines
with
friends
not
12oz
bottles
a
bit
too
harsh
for
the
style
im
overly
pleased
with
this
badboy
ive
only
got
one
other
but
thats
gonna
change
im
about
to
pick
a
couple
more
bottles
up
worth
the
price
a
gluttonous
brew
from
barleywine
fans
across
the
world
avery
1
on
the
competition
edit
2014
edition
is
awesome
a
little
lighter
in
alcohol
it
needs
less
cellar
time
i
imagine
so
much
oak
on
this
just
glorious
slow
sipping
brew
i
stay
away
from
it
sometimes
because
even
12
ounces
is
heavy
lifting
but
i
am
reminded
again
just
how
good
this
beer
is
top
tier
strong
ale
poured
into
a
four
once
taster
glass
at
uber
tavern
2010
vintage
appearance
was
dark
amber
almost
ruby
lots
of
white
head
probably
two
to
three
if
it
was
a
full
pour
leaves
a
gentle
lacing
pretty
viscous
aroma
was
boozy
but
seemed
pretty
balanced
taste
was
a
lot
of
oak
and
a
lot
of
booze
very
slight
hints
of
vanilla
cherry
and
spice
it
seems
like
the
booze
gets
weaker
as
it
warms
but
hits
again
on
the
way
down
palate
was
surprisingly
lively
for
an
aged
barlywine
style
lots
of
carbonation
for
it
leaves
a
lingering
flavor
mostly
oak
and
alcohol
though
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
theres
a
lot
going
on
and
im
not
a
fan
of
all
of
it
i
dont
feel
theres
enough
balance
to
pull
it
off
still
very
flavorful
and
i
can
see
the
allure
to
it
they
were
smart
to
only
pour
this
in
four
ounces
this
one
can
be
devastating
o
legalpete
put
it
very
well
a
couple
of
reviews
ago
a
sweet
flamethrower
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
solid
english
barleywine
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
in
terms
of
barleywines
but
altogether
not
bad
at
all
i
was
really
disappointed
with
this
beer
as
i
really
enjoyed
the
others
in
the
avery
demons
of
ale
series
o
interesting
beer
tough
to
rate
it
was
a
sweet
flame
thrower
that
kept
me
interested
and
drinking
but
i
only
had
to
finish
half
a
bottle
i
can
see
it
being
a
great
night
cap
or
dessert
beer
one
or
half
will
always
be
enough
strangely
drinkable
for
the
abv
the
flavor
is
robustly
alcoholic
up
front
and
sweet
on
the
finish
i
much
like
this
i
would
guess
with
a
few
years
this
beer
would
be
outstanding
there
is
a
certain
sharpness
to
it
at
this
time
that
is
a
bit
detrimental
a
good
solid
sweet
caramel
and
woody
flavor
i
dont
think
this
is
particularly
oxidized
but
it
tastes
slightly
so
in
a
good
way
the
body
is
medium
with
low
smooth
carb
and
a
slick
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
really
spot
on
for
me
o
this
is
a
nice
oakaged
barleywine
and
will
likely
be
welcomed
by
those
who
are
accustomed
to
having
a
rich
strong
ale
after
dinner
on
its
own
samael
is
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
but
still
very
likeable
in
its
way
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
ale
as
much
as
i
did
and
would
have
no
difficulty
recommending
it
to
fans
of
barleywines
in
general
poured
into
a
snifter
this
ale
pours
brilliantly
clear
amberred
with
orangegolden
hue
the
moderate
offwhite
head
diminishes
to
a
skim
after
a
couple
minutes
a
good
looking
glass
of
beer
the
aroma
is
highly
malty
toffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
an
oaky
portlike
character
is
also
evident
a
very
inviting
nose
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sherrylike
cherry
and
plum
fruits
lots
of
toffee
abundant
oak
pleasant
flavor
and
warmth
of
alcohol
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
a
prick
of
alcohol
oaky
and
warms
the
belly
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
carbonation
also
moderate
overall
a
delicious
complex
beer
that
was
very
enjoyable
to
slowly
sip
at
8
12oz
bottle
it
was
a
great
gift
certainly
worth
a
try
but
not
something
that
fits
into
even
a
semiroutine
budget
o
i
wish
i
had
five
of
these
i
would
drink
one
every
year
and
take
tasting
notes
to
see
how
it
progressed
intriguing

pours
a

with
no

the
aroma
is
oak
sweet
plum
raisin
caramel
brown
sugar
molasses
and
alcohol
you
can
definitely
tell
that
this
is
a
sweet
boozy
beer
the
initial
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
plum
and
raisin
then
comes
oak
some
light
oxidation
rum
brown
sugar
and
caramel
the
finish
is
quite
boozy
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
mediumfull
body
close
to
no
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
sweet
and
boozy
which
is
certainly
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
it
is
pretty
decent
for
what
it
is
overall
a
really
nice
strong
barelywine
but
rare
expensive
and
special
one
is
a
nice
experience
but
i
doubt
i
will
buy
another
overall
a
tasty
enjoyable
sipper
definitely
not
a
beer
that
id
feel
like
having
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
but
highly
enjoyable
nonetheless
avery
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
in
the
avery
demons
series
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
that
should
age
really
well
a
vertical
of
this
in
3
or
4
years
should
be
amazing
o
this
is
something
that
i
feel
as
if
needs
to
be
stored
for
a
couple
of
years
for
the
alcohol
to
calm
down
every
time
i
take
a
sip
i
am
just
like
wow
thats
an
insane
amount
of
alcohol
this
is
something
that
should
be
passed
on
especially
with
its
high
price
tag
of
roughly
10
for
a
single
bottle
definitely
hot

this
is
a

beer
no
also
unusual
it
has
a
moderate

component
to
it
but
this
one
was
done
right
in
my
opinion
kidsdocsep

oak
definitely
a
warming
beer
and
would
pair
well
with
a
nice
cheese
or
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
the
alcoholic
power
of
this
beer
however
would
suggest
that
even
half
of
this
twelve
ounce
bottle
would
be
sufficient
i
would
buy
it
again
just
to
store
for
a
special
occasion
o
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
i
bought
four
bottles
and
im
hoping
it
cools
down
after
a
few
years
i
like
it
definitely
an
easy
drinking
sipper
gotta
be
careful
with
this
one
no
question
a
heavyhitting
barleywine
that
is
best
shared
although
the
alcohol
character
is
over
the
top
the
aromas
and
flavors
have
some
real
pleasant
dynamic
qualities
o
a
good
beer
dark
heavy
and
sweet
i
like
it
but
its
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
ill
probably
have
another
but
itll
be
a
while
pretty
drinkable
considering
its
16
the
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
tentative
recommendation
notes
samael
is
the
prince
of
demons
the
angel
of
death
accuser
and
destroyer
filled
with
enmity
towards
man
he
planted
the
vine
the
forbidden
tree
of
paradise
behold
his
venom
and
vengeance
both
sweet
and
tempting
enticing
you
his
spellbound
victim
within
his
wings
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
dont
think
ill
try
it
again
for
awhile
the
alcohol
isnt
really
overpowering
and
its
pretty
thick
and
smooth
but
this
is
definitely
a
slow
sipper
o
a
monster
an
honor
being
able
to
venture
this
one
gfunk
o
really
like
this
brew
very
close
to
a
4
5
on
the
taste
and
overall
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
check
it
out
it
will
warm
your
insides
mouthfeel
a
little
too
syrupy
but
its
not
cough
medicine
syrupy
so
thats
good
more
like
a
cherry
syrup
good
carbonation
o
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
for
a
beer
with
such
a
high
abv
fairly
sweet
i
think
it
could
be
balanced
a
bit
better
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
put
it
in
the
cellar
i
think
it
will
mellow
out
nicely
overall
a
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
brew
very
drinkable
and
smooth
with
that
high

a

with
more

vanilla
full

with

finish
is

and
a

boozy
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
sipper
that
woud
be
great
in
the
winter
months
overall
not
my
favorite
barleywine
a
little
too
much
sweetness
and
then
overpowering
alcohol
if
i
had
to
do
over
i
would
age
this
and
let
it
settle
down
some
may
buy
a
bottle
or
two
for
the
cellar
final
thought
8
and
15
abv
this
is
a
beer
for
the
ages
wow
o
i
am
not
really
sure
what
to
think
of
this
id
really
like
this
beer
much
more
if
aged
as
its
just
too
hot
for
me
man
it
smells
awesome
though
still
drinkable
for
the
strongest
abv
beer
ive
had
definitely
one
to
try
if
youre
adventurous
with
your
beers
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
cant
imagine
picking
it
up
again
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
and
associated
sweetness
in
there
o
this
was
a
very
slow
drinker
for
me
but
well
worth
the
price
for
such
a
high
abv
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
will
be
picking
up
a
few
more
to
cellar
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
which
had
a
considerable
amount
of
age
on
it
the
aroma
was
without
question
its
strong
point
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
definitely
hot
but
what
do
you
expect
from
the
abv
percentage
hard
to
brew
beers
this
big
without
evident
alcohol
very
few
breweries
have
managed
to
do
it
give
it
a
dry
if
you
like
big
boozy
brews
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
and
i
definitely
see
myself
having
it
again
and
recommending
it
to
friends
narrative
please
stacy
that
is
my
grandmothers
faberge
egg
collection
you
just
no
no
anthony
could
only
watch
in
horror
as
his
girlfriend
gorged
herself
on
whiskey
and
plums
destroying
their
possession
with
careless
abandon
ok
no
now
you
are
taking
things
too
far
do
not
push
my
body
by
jake
off
of
the
balcon
no
things
werent
going
so
well
for
the
couple
she
drank
more
ate
more
dark
fruits
and
broke
his
things
as
a
byproduct
what
was
anthony
to
do
the
sex
was
amazing
and
she
was
his
special
persephone
delving
each
night
to
savor
the
succor
of
sour
mash
and
destruction
please
i
have
all
of
my
final
fantasy
save
games
on
those
hours
of
no
somehow
it
all
evened
out
she
was
sweet
while
sober
and
a
complete
monster
when
unleashed
but
he
liked
it
that
way
secretly
earthbound
in
the
original
box
nooo
ill
preface
this
by
saying
im
not
the
biggest
barleywine
fan
english
or
otherwise
however
i
ordered
a
snifter
of
this
at
the
long
room
in
chicago
and
enjoyed
the
heck
of
out
it
the
oak
is
pronounced
and
helps
smooth
out
the
sweet
caramel
smells
and
flavors
lots
of
quirks
and
subtleties
and
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
not
all
of
the
alcohol
is
hidden
and
how
could
it
be
but
the
slight
burn
is
a
plus
not
a
detraction
very
glad
i
had
one
of
these
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
enjoyed
an
avery
offering
so
much
pours
a
nice
ambergarnet
color
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
and
no
retention
or
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
plus
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
a
lot
of
booze
there
as
well
the
flavor
brings
forward
much
of
the
same
though
its
not
as
integrated
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
the
alcohol
is
really
taking
over
plus
theres
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
both
of
these
characteristics
pervade
throughout
the
feel
and
finish
pretty
good
but
needed
more
time
or
it
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
again
very
drinkable
for
being
such
a
big
beer
glad
i
picked
up
2
bottles
cant
wait
to
have
the
other
one
in
a
few
months
or
so
its
so
flavorful
at
4
years
old
a
new
bottle
would
probably
be
too
much
for
me
i
imagine
the
aging
helped
this
out
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
rackhouse
in
denver
poured
a
translucent
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
thin
whitish
head
aromas
of
booze
oak
alcohol
figs
liquor
and
assorted
dark
fruits
nice
oaky
flavors
along
with
brown
sugar
sweet
malt
caramel
and
lots
of
alcohol
overall
a
must
try
i
love
this
beer
i
imagine
it
could
stand
up
to
at
least
another
year
or
two
before
being
poured
but
for
being
4
years
old
i
was
amazed
how
gracefully
its
mellowed
and
developed
secondary
flavors
sit
on
the
newest
batch
for
a
few
years
and
youll
be
rewarded
as
much
as
i
was
taste
is
strong
bad
fermented
toffee
with
a
hint
of
woody
whisky
quality
it
is
soon
evident
that
it
is
sickly
sweet
yet
with
a
hot
strong
alcoholic
boozy
character
rough
sharp
onedimensional
and
unpleasant
this
has
a
couple
traits
that
are
really
intense
without
anything
else
and
goes
for
sheer
strength
over
any
semblance
of
quality
complexity
or
the
like
i
know
the
abv
is
high
but
ive
had
several
that
are
very
close
to
this
and
are
far
smoother
less
obviously
boozy
and
have
complexixty
and
character
rather
than
simply
hot
sweet
rough
alcohol
it
is
a
total
dud
pours
a
slightly
murky
copper
with
a
very
short
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
ring
im
not
overly
concerned
about
this
given
that
the
bottle
im
drinking
is
two
years
old
and
that
the
abv
is
so
high
smells
extremely
sweet
like
malt
candy
i
dont
mind
some
sweetness
but
this
is
ridiculous
the
taste
is
also
quite
sweet
but
there
is
fortunately
some
zingy
citrus
and
apple
as
well
a
bit
of
spice
and
some
creamy
custard
really
the
taste
is
quite
nice
if
you
can
deal
with
a
sweeter
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
after
two
years
in
the
bottle
the
only
heat
i
felt
was
from
the
first
sip
i
had
after
the
pour
after
it
opens
and
warms
it
is
actually
quite
mellow
and
drinkable
also
im
pleased
to
note
that
no
sherry
notes
have
crept
in
after
cellaring
for
years
ive
come
to
dislike
that
particular
flavor
and
had
thought
of
giving
it
up
except
that
with
the
right
beer
like
this
one
and
innumerable
sours
the
result
is
quite
pleasant
o
not
bad
for
a
what
i
would
classify
as
a
strong
ale
the
sweetness
of
it
is
just
a
bit
too
much
for
me
other
than
that
a
good
strong
ale
overall
its
alright
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
its
not
something
ill
likely
be
seeking
out
again
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
and
ill
be
challenged
to
finish
the
bottle
on
my
own
this
is
definitely
one
to
share
o
this
beer
is
just
fabulous
im
sure
the
fresh
version
is
hot
as
hell
if
thats
your
thing
great
me
yeah
im
sipping
a
5
year
old
vintage
thats
a
little
smoother
mf
big
and
creamy
this
is
a
very
rich
and
flavorful
beer
thats
only
big
downfall
is
how
out
of
balance
it
is
with
the
sweetness
but
on
the
other
hand
with
this
big
of
an
abv
its
almost
understandable
almost
this
beer
will
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
i
would
say
on
an
avery
scale
it
is
oddly
the
drinkability
is
very
low
this
is
a
beer
that
looks
much
better
then
it
tastes
and
smells
samaels
can
use
additional
ibus
to
balance
the
malty
sweetness
even
for
the
style
d
delicious
but
the
heat
makes
it
an
unlikely
candidate
for
the
daily
drinker
skål
i
am
on
the
fence
with
samael
i
love
it
but
it
is
so
cloying
hard
to
finish
but
still
enjoyable
in
the
old
drinkability
it
would
be
a
2
5
in
the
new
overall
it
is
a
3
5
because
it
really
is
a
good
beer
but
the
sweetness
hurts
it
significantly
overall
as
noted
this
is
good
to
sample
and
discuss
as
a
novelty
craft
beer
to
me
at
least
its
quite
an
item
and
stands
out
as
an
extreme
of
the
style
6

can
down

and
i
just
love
to
drink
it
have
yet
to
find
an

beer
thats
not
wonderful
at
4
years

this
beer
is
amazing
batch

from

d
definite
sipper
because
of
booziness
but
has
more
drinkability
than
most
15
beers
pineapple
apricot

mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable

at

with

syrupy

the
palate
samael
is
certainly
a
sipping
beer
the
sweetness
is
great
and
keeps
from
becoming
cloying
great
find
and
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
it
in
the
future
d
a
very
flavorful
and
robust
beer
i
love
it
one
will
be
last
me
through
at
least
the
hour
back
in
the
day
this
beer
kicked
my
sorry
ass
lets
see
how
things
have
progressed
eh
it
pours
a
hazy
russetamber
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
toffee
vanilla
oak
caramel
and
a
small
touch
of
booze
in
the
back
though
that
remains
decidedly
demure
the
taste
holds
notes
of
harshly
sweet
toffee
light
whiskey
caramel
and
maple
syrup
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
annoying
but
at
least
its
not
oerwhelming
the
body
is
lightly
hefty
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
syrupy
feel
overall
a
pretty
decent
bwine
but
too
sweet
for
my
liking
other
than
that
though
not
too
bad
this
beer
pours
a
tawny
amber
color
with
an
ecru
foam
covering
the
surface
the
beer
needs
to
be
allowed
to
warm
up
before
enjoying
due
to
the
fact
that
its
repugnant
until
at
correct
temperatures
the
smell
is
strongly
of
figs
plums
butterscotch
and
rum
there
is
really
no
alcohol
aroma
behind
the
beer
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
this
beer
isnt
strong
the
taste
of
this
beer
greatly
follows
the
nose
in
almost
every
way
except
there
is
a
residual
vanilla
taste
that
comes
from
the
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
cloying
along
with
the
buttery
mouthfeel
i
could
honestly
do
without
this
beer
i
sipped
and
still
got
buzzed
so
its
drinkability
is
highly
questionable
a
good
beer
overall
but
for
the
love
of
god
let
the
thing
warm
up

decent

very
rich

heavy

to

along
with
some
undecided
dark

notes
and
even
some
aromatics
reminiscent
of
smoked

the

smell
of
this
very
much
like
a
lagvulin
j
w
lees
no
hops
present
in
this
one
maybe
even
some
small
hints
of
chocolate
malt
to
this
overall
an
aroma
leaning
towards
some
dark
nutty
earthy
notes
very
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
sits
very
heavy
low
carbonation
rich
in
flavor
as
well
packed
with
caramel

notes
dark

some
chocolate
finish
with
warmth
leans
towards
the
alcohol
content
slightly
medicinal
aftertaste
brings
more
of
the
pete
and
nutty
flavor
with
a
big
caramel
and
alcohol
kick
definitely
one
to
sip
on
a
very
complex
and
tasty
drink
to
say
the
absolute
least
overall
this
aged
exceptionally
well
and
i
am
hard
pressed
to
think
of
an
american
brewer
with
a
better
barleywine
given
proper
cellaring
i
would
say
that
this
will
continue
to
improve
and
i
will
sit
on
my
remaining
ones
for
a
few
more
years
not
recommended
to
drink
with
spicy
foods
because
this
beer
is
hot
great
beer
for
sipping
and
when
it
is
cold
out
this
would
probably
be
most
enjoyed
around
the
campfire
in
early
springlate
fall
glad
i
have
3
left
to
enjoy
o
this
beer
is
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
but
it
is
complex
and
a
big
time
beer
interesting
offering
from
avery
d
dude
not
a
session
beer
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
cause
of
the
taste
but
because
of
the
amount
of
alcohol
d
nice
warming
barleywine
but
the
burn
from
the
booze
slows
down
drinking
d
this
is
a
sipping
beer
and
one
that
would
probably
benefit
from
more
aging
dalthough
the
alcohol
is
incredibly
high
thats
not
what
brings
down
the
drinkability
here
its
actually
the
sweetness
that
makes
it
difficult
to
do
anything
but
sip
creamy
mediumfull
bodied
mouth
feel
with
just
the
right
carbonation
level
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
brew
this
potent
d
this
is
a
sipper
and
its
great
it
has
a
little
stronger
alcohol
taste
than
i
expected
considering
its
been
bottled
over
three
and
a
half
years
ago
i
really
enjoy
it
its
amazing
to
see
what
some
time
can
do
to
beers
a
very
interesting
intense
beer
its
a
bit
of
a
struggle
to
finish
though
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
drink
it
has
some
interesting
flavors
in
it
but
there
is
something
stale
tasting
in
the
finish
it
is
such
a
strong
ale
perhaps
it
is
the
dried
fruit
flavors
but
while
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
it
may
be
a
little
to
much
drinkability
while
i
loved
the
flavor
i
needed
almost
2
hours
to
drink
the
entire
12oz
bottle
man
vs
booze
d
i
like
it
very
smooth
and
complex
glad
i
split
this
three
ways
and
for
the
price
i
wont
be
buying
this
very
often
or
again
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
time
this
beer
and
i
had
together
this
is
an
absolutely
terrific
american
attempt
at
an
english
barleywine
it
looks
nice
in
the
glass
it
smells
wonderful
and
is
just
a
well
crafted
big
beer
however
this
drinks
every
bit
its
advertised
164
and
will
take
quite
some
time
to
get
through
12
ounces
taste
is
sweet
boozy
sharp
and
a
bit
harsh
theres
oak
and
sweet
candy
and
lots
of
tasty
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
its
a
bit
sweet
but
well
balanced
md
so
so
drinkable
despite
the
high
abv
a
tad
syrupy
on
the
mouth
coats
the
tongue
on
every
swig
the
alcohol
burn
isnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
itd
be
a
great
unique
beer
expensive
but
worth
it
has
a
creamy
heavy
hot
and
deliriously
satisfying
mouthfeel
much
like
being
in
a
sauna
with
a
couple
of
horny
buxom
female
prize
fighters
who
want
to
spar
with
your
beergut
fatass
a
bit
youre
gonna
take
a
few
hits
with
this
one
but
its
all
gonna
be
worth
it
in
the
end
all
i
can
say
is
approach
with
caution
take
your
licks
but
dont
forget
to
enjoy
the
ride
overall
impression
a
dangerous
beer
one
that
makes
me
briefly
contemplate
tackling
2
16
beers
in
one
session
this
one
does
not
deserve
to
fly
under
the
radar
this
beer
is
huge
but
extremely
drinkable
for
its
strength
a
12oz
bottle
is
perfect
drinkability
3
5
out
of
5
my
god
this
beer
is
good
for
a
beer
about
which
i
had
heard
a
lot
of
stories
about
not
being
able
to
finish
it
i
am
immensely
pleased
it
went
down
so
easily
that
i
could
definitely
drink
another
however
its
drinkability
takes
a
hit
from
the
prohibitive
price
another
hit
comes
from
the
fact
that
its
so
strong
two
would
be
enough
for
almost
any
beer
lover
anyone
trying
to
get
shitfaced
should
probably
just
look
for
a
cheaper
more
chuggable
brew
instead
of
this
pedestalworthy
rarity
d
speechless
couldnt
get
through
a
6oz
serving
love
of
god
i
was
definitely
expecting
this
to
taste
a
little
like
the
beast
but
i
was
very
pleased
to
find
out
that
they
are
two
different
drinks
my
one
complain
is
the
sugar
level
it
makes
the
glass
too
sticky
but
does
not
effect
the
flavor
much
i
was
anticipating
a
little
more
happening
in
this
beer
but
it
seems
like
its
going
to
be
impossible
to
do
so
fortunately
the
made
this
big
boy
different
enough
that
im
not
in
a
rush
to
write
this
off
as
another
juggernaut
beer
it
possesses
a
lot
of
things
youve
had
before
but
just
enough
to
make
it
that
much
different
and
at
such
an
alcohol
i
imagine
aging
this
one
wont
help
at
this
point
a
beast
of
a
brew
great
ollld
oak
flavors
with
hard
liquor
qualities
then
a
huge
caramelly
rush
with
a
bit
of
candied
sugar
this
is
my
3rd
time
having
a
23
yr
old
vintage
and
the
older
it
gets
the
better
it
seems
to
get
so
far
i
highly
recommend
it
d
not
terrible
for
a
16
5
beer
but
lets
be
honest
the
sicklysweet
character
plus
the
alky
combine
for
something
i
cant
even
finish
one
of
avery
have
done
a
fantastic
job
on
this
beer
but
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
tackle
a
bottle
of
it
on
my
own
at
one
sitting
not
without
company
to
share
it
with
d
a
fine
well
made
english
barleywine
dont
know
how
many
of
these
i
could
drink
in
one
sitting
but
still
a
good
brew
d
sippable
i
am
wishing
i
split
this
12
oz
with
my
wife
instead
of
each
of
us
taking
one
to
put
it
simply
this
beer
is
exactly
what
its
supposed
to
be
i
was
skeptical
of
these
10
12oz
bottles
despite
my
uniformly
good
experiences
with
averys
beer
but
im
a
believer
now
this
is
a
beer
you
buy
hold
on
to
then
enjoy
thoroughly
when
its
time
for
a
big
hot
sipper
with
endless
flavor
d
none
whatsoever
just
couldnt
dig
this
one
and
i
am
an
avery
fan
sorry
d
hmm
this
beer
isnt
what
i
would
call
drinkable
but
its
not
like
i
wouldnt
if
i
didnt
get
so
tore
up
a
great
tasting
beer
that
would
go
really
well
with
a
meal
that
could
hold
up
to
it
d
yeah
its
hot
sweet
and
franky
kind
of
obnoxious
not
to
mention
expensive
i
like
it
though
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
i
expected
to
this
one
probably
fits
better
as
an
english
strong
ale
but
who
am
i
to
disagree
ive
traveled
the
world
and
the
seven
seas
everybody
is
lookin
for
something
active
pour
gets
you
close
to
three
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
mostly
mediumsized
bubbles
so
theres
retention
in
a
steady
dissolving
fashion
the
lacing
is
incredibly
thick
more
a
sheer
wall
than
streaks
dense
cloudiness
to
the
reddish
brown
mud
coloration
you
might
have
to
want
to
find
a
more
orange
to
yellow
hue
around
the
rims
close
to
nada
bubbles
visible
the
nose
makes
you
think
willy
wonka
is
in
the
house
vanilla
fudge
caramel
milk
chocolate
butterscotch
coconut
licorice
nuts
the
pear
peach
yellow
apple
cherry
scents
close
to
dried
fruit
in
nature
somehow
manages
to
develop
and
erect
posture
in
the
complete
absence
of
hops
or
anything
which
might
keep
its
knuckles
off
the
ground
fullbodied
the
carbonation
is
close
to
zip
this
said
it
does
have
more
fluidity
than
expected
and
is
just
shifty
enough
that
you
can
ignore
how
boozy
or
hot
it
is
sweet
plum
cherry
apricot
pear
fruit
when
paired
with
all
that
vanilla
caramel
butterscotch
it
kinda
becomes
hard
to
take
it
seriously
as
a
nuanced
beer
kind
of
defies
you
to
find
a
hoppy
spine
homogeneous
enough
that
you
have
to
say
if
you
have
a
cigar
and
the
time
to
smoke
it
do
so
cause
it
may
be
your
last
chance
still
you
cannot
deny
how
it
massages
your
primary
pleasure
nodes
d
hard
to
drink
a
big
disappointment
after
mephistopheles
alcohol
is
hidden
not
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
this
monster
hides
its
booze
well
but
its
there
fantastic
offering
in
the
style
not
to
be
missed
for
ebw
fans
but
definitely
a
oneanddone
this
is
something
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
over
the
course
of
a
couple
hours
not
in
gulps
diabetes
and
caries
inducing
but
quite
drinkable
notes
super
complex
but
dense
fat
and
slick
this
beer
is
all
about
hedonism
and
lusciousness
the
booze
is
present
but
not
aggressively
prickly
its
more
slick
than
hot
not
for
the
faint
of
palate
this
beer
will
wreck
you
ffo
stone
double
bastard
north
coast
old
stock
ale
j
w
lees
harvest
ales
big
sweet
delicious
just
like
me
d
definitely
an
afterdinner
drink
for
sipping
probably
best
shared
with
a
friend
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
d
well
this
isnt
exactly
a
beer
that
you
can
really
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
it
does
have
a
very
good
taste
thats
worth
picking
up
sometime
to
try
d
i
find
myself
enjoying
each
sip
a
little
more
than
the
last
only
concern
is
the
high
abv
this
is
a
great
once
in
while
beer
feel
is
slick
oily
feels
as
though
it
coats
the
entire
palate
truly
a
dominating
brew
surely
not
for
the
weak
and
undedicated
you
need
to
be
a
man
to
finish
one
of
these
d
cant
drink
too
much
of
this
in
one
sitting
but
i
will
be
getting
it
again
though
next
time
i
hope
they
give
out
some
complimentary
insulin
drinkability
very
good
beer
i
love
the
complexity
of
it
as
far
as
being
able
to
come
back
for
another
one
or
two
i
couldnt
say
i
could
do
it
one
a
night
would
be
my
limit
for
this
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
wouldnt
mind
sharing
with
someone
either
i
am
going
back
to
have
another
notesi
think
im
going
to
pick
up
another
bottle
and
horde
it
away
for
a
few
years
and
rereview
this
this
beer
really
scream
out
to
be
aged
what
an
amazing
little
sipper
this
one
turned
out
to
be
d
for
a
16
45
abv
beer
this
is
remarkably
drinkable
the
first
barleywine
that
i
have
truly
enjoyed
perhaps
it
is
because
it
has
already
aged
2
years
this
beer
has
opened
my
mind
up
tp
barleyines
which
i
had
previously
decided
werent
fro
me
batch
5
aged
a
year
opening
in
may
2010
after
buying
may
2009
and
shared
with
a
friend
pours
a
light
amber
with
little
or
no
lacing
smell
is
one
of
fermented
or
rotting
fruit
particularly
raisin
or
prune
or
apricot
all
sweetness
but
varying
degrees
of
sourness
creep
in
tastes
like
a
fine
bourbon
thats
toned
down
quite
a
bit
the
abv
is
well
hidden
in
the
drink
feels
more
like
an
11
or
12
abv
beer
overall
a
good
beer
to
share
with
someone
as
a
full
bottle
could
prove
a
daunting
task
id
try
it
again
especially
if
a
different
batch
was
made
available
to
me
batch
4
bottled
april
2008
in
a
snifter
it
was
a
pretty
cherry

color
with
a
small

head
very
sweet
aroma
caramel
and
fruit
fairly
hot

aroma

sweet

a

noticeable
syrupy

d
i
love
this
stuff
so
have
no
difficulty
putting
it
away
reminds
me
of
alpine
great
big
sky
old
bluehair
and
j
w
lees
d
the
aging
has
done
awesome
things
for
this
beer
its
simply
awesome
now
that
this
thing
has
sat
for
3
yrs
its
still
god
damn
undrinkable
and
theres
shit
floating
everywhere
good
carbonation
otherwise
a
little
lively
smells
like
im
gonna
have
a
terrible
morning
unholy
booze
tastes
like
fermented
prune
juice
or
a
dr
pepper
old
grand
dad
way
to
drinkable
fuck
them
and
their
14
9
abv
im
going
to
bed
as
far
a
barley
wine
goes
there
are
ones
that
are
far
better
this
is
a
fun
one
to
drink
instant
buzz
in
a
bottle
samaels
ale
is
definitely
a
sipper
based
on
its
richness
and
its
hefty
abv
in
fact
it
was
a
little
bit
like
drinking
some
kind
of
liqueur
i
enjoyed
my
first
experience
with
samaels
ale
and
i
would
love
to
cellar
a
bottle
for
a
few
years
pours
like
a
heavy
dark
void
that
was
impenetrable
by
light
it
was
topped
with
a
thick
brown
and
bubbly
head
and
that
didnt
waste
its
time
disappearing
little
carbonation
there
were
strong
sweet
aromas
ranging
from
tootsie
rolls
to
vanilla
to
melted
brown
sugar
all
covered
by
a
slight
undertone
of
alcohol
its
well
enveloped
by
alcohol
with
a
strong
sweet
with
hints
of
almond
vanilla
brer
rabbit
molasses
caramel
and
dark
fruit
oh
yes
and
malts
flavors
too
this
is
a
full
bodied
ale
that
really
knocks
your
taste
buds
around
this
ale
does
have
some
smooth
qualities
in
its
drinkability
but
is
a
real
in
your
face
ale
overall
this
was
a
rather
difficult
beer
for
me
to
drink
but
well
worth
the
experience
well
this
ones
been
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years

uncapped
and
poured
into
my
tulip
glass
samaels
appears
a
clear
crimson
brown
color
with
barely
any
foam
to
mention

and
flavors
consist
of
dark
toasted

very
mild
cider

candied

soaked

medium
to
full

for
the
style
and
somewhat
syrupy
with
decent
carbonation
alcohol
heat
was
not
as
noticeable
as
i
thought
it
would
be
this
has
mellowed
quite
nicely
actually
nice
drinkability
one
sip
at
a
time
just
had
the
2010
release
and
it
was
as
fantastic
as
it
always
is
pours
a
great
dark
copper
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
dissapates
on
the
nose
i
mainly
got
notes
of
vanilla
and
maple
syrup
the
palate
was
sweet
and
malty
with
flaovrs
of
vanilla
extract
nuts
and
banana
the
high
bav
really
starts
to
show
through
in
the
finish
sort
of
drinks
like
a
good
cognac
goes
down
smooth
with
a
slight
burn
at
the
end
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
was
surprised
how
easy
this
went
down
for
me
as
i
thought
it
would
be
pretty
intense
with
a
16
45
abv
there
is
a
bit
of
burning
as
it
goes
down
but
nothing
to
really
turn
me
off
it
seems
to
be
one
the
sweet
side
but
still
a
pretty
good
example
of
and
english
style
barleywine
i
would
enjoy
having
another
but
this
is
best
as
a
once
in
a
while
beer
for
me
d
a
delicious
strong
ale
i
like
revisiting
beers
ive
had
before
my
ba
days
its
a
good
compass
to
compare
where
ive
come
in
4
years
the
beer
reminds
me
of
a
young
jw
lees
in
some
ways
its
still
a
bit
boozy
but
at
16
5
and
a
year
old
i
cant
say
i
blame
it
great
now
but
a
beer
i
want
to
put
in
a
vault
until
2025
and
see
where
it
goes
big
beer
big
alcohol
not
all
that
good
though
overall
i
bought
this
beer
without
reading
the
label
and
without
knowing
anything
about
it
i
was
surprised
at
how
big
it
is
ive
had
lots
of
big
beers
and
this
seems
to
be
one
of
those
that
brags
about
its
bigness
the
booze
becomes
too
much
of
a
focal
point
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
a
bit
over
the
top
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
beer
just
isnt
the
best
of
its
kind
if
this
brew
were
a
bit
more
balanced
it
could
be
truly
amazing
still
a
good
craft
ale
experience
a
devil
of
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
name
this
beer
has
a
level
of
complexity
one
expects
with
a
cognac
it
pours
deep
brownish
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
it
has
an
incredibly
strong
smell
of
honey
taste
is
amazingly
complicated
with
hints
of
cherry
chocolate
licorice
cinnamon
vanilla
and
plumbs
this
beer
does
nothing
to
hide
it
alcohol
and
why
should
it
at
a
whopping
33
proof
it
should
say
it
loud
and
proud
it
goes
down
quite
smooth
though
drinkability
is
good
but
at
the
strength
this
beer
is
i
wouldnt
recommend
too
many
in
one
sitting
drinkability
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
to
any
lighter
beer
fans
or
beer
newbs
i
cant
really
envision
a
type
of
session
that
would
involve
one
of
these
but
it
was
worth
a
try
notes
here
avery
does
a
great
job
at
matching
the
extreme
and
provocative
theme
of
these
demons
of
ale
makes
me
wonder
how
they
can
make
this
impressive
ale
next
to
a
trite
offering
like
hog
heaven
anyhow
i
take
the
good
with
the
ugly
and
keep
on
remebering
them
for
these
offerings
the
color
on
this
beauty
is
a
very
dark
root
beer
brown
cloudy
and
murky
with
a
fair
oatmeal
colored
head
and
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
says
deep
licorice
malt
and
nutty
brown
bread
with
lots
of
red
winebourbon
on
top
very
full
and
robust
very
nice
the
flavor
offers
a
blast
to
the
mouth
full
of
tawny
port
and
nutty
malt
wow
very
sweet
and
thick
but
somehow
long
as
you
keep
a
slow
pace
it
settles
in
with
a
really
delicious
red
wine
scoth
ale
combo
deal
its
pretty
much
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
bit
of
a
resinous
feel
and
an
appropriately
fine
carbonation
this
is
no
session
beer
but
it
is
a
great
taste
experience
to
savor
nice
stuff
this
beer
is
nobodys
session
beer
but
it
is
highly
drinkable
overall
if
you
want
to
warm
up
quickly
and
get
drunk
within
minutes
this
beer
is
perfect
however
the
alcohol
really
wasnt
the
problem
here
just
way
too
sweet
plain
and
simple
good
beer
this
was
a
nice
surprise
i
expected
a
gimmicky
look
how
strong
our
beer
is
kind
of
beer
that
was
probably
going
to
be
a
hot
boozy
mess
it
was
actually
really
quite
good
and
something
i
would
drink
again
i
think
the
5
years
of
aging
probably
helped
this
out
a
lot
im
really
diggin
this
beer
i
feel
very
lucky
to
have
stumbled
upon
an
entire
sixer
of
this
unfortunately
ive
never
had
this
beer
fresh
so
i
can
only
speculate
on
the
changes
that
have
occured
i
dont
believe
this
is
available
in
pittsburgh
anymore
but
im
going
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
a
fresh
bottle
barleywines
arent
my
favorite
but
if
this
is
the
norm
for
aged
bws
then
i
will
certainly
be
grabbing
some
more
btls
from
time
to
time
for
cellaring
purposes
d
difficult
to
get
down
especially
with
the
high
abv
i
split
the
first
bottle
i
had
4
ways
and
wound
up
finishing
all
4
glasses
myself
d
the
alcohol
is
amazingly
hidden
but
the
sweetness
makes
this
12
oz
bottle
a
perfect
dessert
beer
for
a
dinner
party
of
4
id
say
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
slight
sweet
malt
oakliquor
and
slight
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
english
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
dark
citrus
oakliquor
and
slight
hops
overall
the
alcohol
clearly
dominates
but
still
glad
i
tried
overall
impression
everything
i
expected
some
such
a
beast
not
very
drinkable
unless
you
have
a
companion
to
split
the
bottle
mine
is
very
adament
that
my
review
is
a
little
rough
but
it
is
my
opinion
i
am
really
disappointed
and
hate
to
have
to
rate
this
beer
so
poorly
as
i
can
appreciate
how
difficult
such
an
intensive
beer
could
be
to
create
i
have
tried
some
other
brews
which
i
would
put
into
this
same
category
barley
johns
annes
old
ale
17
abv
samuel
adams
utopias
27
abv
and
granted
they
are
much
more
expensive
they
deserve
the
price
tag
and
the
recognition
when
the
abv
gets
so
high
balance
is
critical
and
samaels
ale
is
not
there
and
is
very
poorly
done
even
with
other
reviewers
suggestion
of
mellowing
or
even
microwaving
i
dont
think
this
beer
will
ever
be
worth
the
cumulative
ba
rating
it
is
getting
oooohhh
baby
this
be
one
fine
assed
beer
mmm
hmm
yessir
pour
was
nothing
special
with
just
a
soso
smallish
off
white
head
color
is
a
lovely
rich
clear
medium
amber
aroma
is
surprisingly
mildly
malty
and
hoppy
flavor
is
where
this
sweet
little
dog
knocks
my
socks
off
boom
wild
combination
of
characteristics
really
hoppy
really
malty
sweet
lots
of
oak
and
some
spicy
hot
something
or
other
body
is
luscious
and
carbonation
in
tune
finish
is
sultry
and
leaves
me
with
a
comeon
for
another
decadent
sip
have
i
sold
my
soul
who
cares
good
beer
though
cant
hardly
be
a
session
dstay
away
if
you
dont
like
boozy
beers
this
ones
a
sipper
but
none
the
less
pretty
good
especially
as
a
night
cap
is
it
possible
a
cognac
was
born
and
nobody
bother
to
tell
it
it
was
actually
a
beer
d
this
beer
has
a
delicious
malt
sweetness
with
some
nice
support
from
alcohol
and
oak
that
turns
a
bit
to
boozy
as
it
is
pretty
warm
this
beer
is
big
and
rich
which
is
a
great
sipper
to
take
the
chill
of
winter
d
needed
to
recap
this
beer
after
sharing
half
of
it
tm
thick
malty
sweet
and
intense
wow
very
complex
with
port
like
characteristics
dried
fruit
and
slight
licorice
flavors
are
most
noticeable
very
nice
alcohol
warming
effect
this
beer
needs
to
be
sipped
and
chewed
i
suppose
this
is
pretty
much
just
an
alcohol
heavy
oaked
barleywine
if
youre
not
into
huge
boozy
beers
than
stay
away
from
this
one
at
all
costs
drinkability
its
not
really
that
drinkable
its
not
really
meant
to
be
its
ok
as
a
sipper
and
its
a
fun
thing
to
try
i
would
never
buy
it
again
but
i
will
buy
their
next
experiment
i
wound
up
microwaving
the
rest
of
the
bottle
for
1
min
1200w
the
ethanol
receded
substantially
and
the
beer
became
halfway
drinkable
with
strong
honey
cherries
orange
rind
and
oak
its
not
something
for
which
i
can
justifiably
bump
up
the
score
but
its
a
suggestion
microwave
it
instead
of
drainpouring
it
but
i
think
both
are
very
good
just
one
left
to
try
mephistopheles
d
this
one
is
tasty
as
all
hell
but
way
to
sweet
and
rich
to
actually
enjoy
more
than
12
oz
in
a
sitting
interesting
to
see
how
this
one
mellows
out
over
time
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
in
a
year
or
3
d
last
time
i
had
one
of
these
i
woke
up
sprawled
on
the
couch
with
a
third
of
a
glass
left
way
smoother
this
time
around
definitely
delicious
and
if
my
body
was
capable
of
pounding
back
a
few
id
do
it
d
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
just
might
be
showing
its
age
or
it
just
needs
half
a
decade
to
balance
out
i
cant
decide
either
way
this
is
one
robust
thick
and
really
sweet
barleywine
that
warms
you
up
with
a
sweet
alchoholic
feel
while
at
the
same
time
absolutely
kicking
you
to
the
floor
withough
apologizing
despite
my
poor
rating
i
really
want
to
see
what
additional
aging
would
do
to
one
of
these
very
sweet
id
try
this
again
but
only
as
a
share
desert
beer
d
the
combination
of
the
very
sweet
taste
and
high
alcohol
content
make
it
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
im
having
a
hard
enough
time
just
finishing
this
bottle
overall
this
was
a
very
impressive
big
abv
beer
and
the
bold
flavors
do
their
job
in
covering
up
the
alcohol
certainly
worth
a
shot
i
need
to
re
visit
this
batch
soon
pours
a
clear
bright
orange
some
neat
tangerine
highlights
thick
off
white
head
forms
pretty
admirable
for
a
brew
of
this
strength
lace
chunks
stick
to
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
settles
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
intense
big
alcohol
very
woody
citrus
vanilla
a
bit
harsh
fruit
raisins
toffee
brown
sugar
very
rough
and
intense
taste
is
similar
but
nice
big
alcohol
and
toffee
rich
vanilla
oak
sweet
and
sugary
butterscotch
toasted
wood
sherry
a
bit
rough
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
syrupy
with
low
carbonation
some
big
warmth
going
down
a
little
rough
going
down
but
i
was
surprised
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
sipper
for
sure
and
wouldnt
want
more
than
5
oz
drinkability
the
abv
in
this
one
is
high
and
not
easily
overcome
its
a
good
beer
but
will
be
difficult
to
make
it
through
the
bottle
d
not
too
drinkable
because
its
a
strong
one
but
very
delicious
at
the
same
time
about
what
youd
expect
for
such
high
abv
sweet
and
boozy
reminds
of
carbonated
sherry
it
has
a
deep
redbrown
body
with
a
little
cabonation
the
head
and
lace
are
both
very
thick
and
offwhite
this
beer
has
a
aged
wood
and
candy
like
aroma
it
has
some
very
heavy
fruit
esters
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
buttery
full
and
has
some
alcohol
presents
a
lot
warmth
to
it
there
is
a
very
rich
and
sweet
aftertaste
drinkability
to
call
this
one
a
slow
sipper
is
a
bit
of
an
understatement
while
id
tout
other
beers
for
their
keen
drinkability
here
id
give
myself
a
pat
on
the
back
for
the
ability
to
drink
and
endure
the
entire
twelve
ounces
also
it
may
or
may
not
have
been
the
initial
jawseizing
grimace
but
either
way
all
this
sweetness
has
caused
one
of
my
teeth
to
hurt
drinkability
what
drinkability
there
is
none
this
is
a
slow
sipper
that
will
kick
you
in
the
pants
from
beginning
to
end
i
love
how
the
oak
elements
really
pop
out
of
this
after
tasting
it
it
almost
makes
the
aroma
deceiving
since
i
got
alot
of
cherries
chocolate
in
here
overall
these
avery
beers
are
standout
brews
although
i
liked
the
grand
cru
mephistopheles
a
bit
better
this
is
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
take
caution
with
this
one
its
smooth
and
not
too
hard
to
drink
but
this
one
will
catch
up
to
you
quickly
highly
recommended
d
a
sipper
a
big
beer
for
sure
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
this
beer
is
one
to
be
enjoyed
in
front
of
a
fire
on
a
winters
night
nothing
like
a
good
oakaged
barleywine
this
one
pours
a
nice
medium
brown
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
and
a
strong
smell
warming
alcohol
burn
from
beginning
to
end
but
worth
it
all
the
while
this
one
was
batch
4
april
2008
with
an
abv
sitting
at
15
53
drank
from
a
snifter
slightly
cold
my
mistake
but
would
probably
have
been
even
better
just
at
cellar
temperature
i
really
wish
we
could
get
avery
here
because
they
make
some
of
the
best
beers
around
samaels
i
would
have
to
say
though
is
near
the
top
of
the
list
along
with
the
beast
and
maharaja
may
not
be
something
you
can
drink
all
night
but
i
wouldnt
mind
being
the
one
to
try
will
have
to
make
sure
to
grab
a
few
of
these
the
next
chance
i
get
a
this
is
a
tasty
brew
for
certain
but
i
am
not
putting
down
more
than
one
because
of
both
the
high
abv
and
also
the
aggressive
palate
if
you
enjoy
an
antagonistic
high
gravity
beer
this
is
a
must
try
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
burnt
toffee
aroma
along
with
a
kick
ass
wood
aged
scent
it
lends
a
nice
vanilla
character
to
the
beer
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
wicked
oak
flavor
that
wraps
itself
up
with
the
caramel
notes
and
burnt
toffee
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
its
a
sipper
for
sure
but
damn
is
it
tastey
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
speaks
largely
of
the
caramel
malts
and
dried
fruit
maybe
a
bit
of
raisin
in
there
but
the
oak
mellows
it
all
out
with
the
vanilla
and
earthiness
the
taste
follows
with
the
fruity
esters
up
front
with
a
lot
of
sweet
roasted
malt
little
in
the
way
of
hops
to
speak
of
the
full
body
is
nice
but
for
a
beer
of
this
maginitude
i
could
use
a
bit
less
co2
a
nice
barley
wine
none
the
less
the
smell
off
the
bottle
was
oaky
and
maybe
a
bit
brandy
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
had
it
sit
for
10
minutes
wow
definitely
can
smell
a
strong
slighty
burnt
oak
aroma
poured
a
dark
golden
color
no
head
and
slight
bubbles
first
taste
is
strong
but
not
overly
strong
with
a
slight
roasted
flavor
and
an
alcohol
back
end
good
mouthfeel
as
it
doesnt
overwhelm
it
as
i
expected
it
being
16
45
drinkability
is
a
strong
ale
with
a
strong
alcohol
back
end
would
be
a
good
winter
beer
on
a
cold
day
or
night
this
is
a
take
your
time
and
drink
beer
drinking
off
a
pint
glass
im
getting
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
and
its
a
grabber
back
end
taste
a
little
like
candy
overall
a
good
beer
that
im
glad
i
finally
tried
pretty
close
for
an
english
barleywine
mostly
other
than
the
medicinal
bit
and
the
burps
whoa
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
as
it
shows
the
alcohol
and
the
wood
character
very
prominently
its
very
sweet
as
well
and
overall
has
a
pretty
limited
drinkability
a
sipper
but
also
good
with
dessert
drink
with
care
the
alcohol
really
creeps
up
on
you
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
but
relatively
good
for
the
high
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
present
but
enjoyable
very
sweet
tasting
with
berrylike
fruitiness
and
a
wintergreen
mintmenthol
alcohol
flavor
oak
is
there
but
is
somewhat
covered
up
by
an
almost
distractingly
syrupy
sweetness
there
are
a
few
other
flavors
in
there
cola
touch
of
smoke
and
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
virtually
has
no
carbonation
very
much
drinks
like
a
port
certainly
a
sipper
i
think
i
like
this
better
than
the
beast
d
simply
put
i
am
pretty
blown
away
by
this
beer
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
overall
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
beer
this
bottle
was
only
a
few
months
old
i
cant
imagine
what
a
few
years
would
do
to
this
beer
time
to
go
stock
up
on
a
few
bottles
of
this
for
aging
purposes
very
good
furry
mouthfeel
but
the
alcohol
certainly
affects
the
drinkability
overall
great
brew
again
from
avery
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
nice
delight
only
thing
i
would
change
would
a
be
a
little
bit
more
hop
and
oak
character
smells
sweet
some
fruits
noticed
a
strong
cherry
armoma
which
goes
well
with
the
ruby
color
smells
oaky
somewhat
like
whiskey
a
bit
of
other
fruits
and
citrus
that
was
juiced
over
burning
oak
ashes
tastes
great
very
sweet
and
fruity
also
tastes
like
buttered
biscuits
sweet
and
yeasty
very
silky
and
tastes
great
still
some
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
absolutely
delicious
glad
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
this
one
can
still
go
for
some
more
time
malty
and
hot
throughout
little
hoppiness
caramel
sweetness
and
little
carbonation
a
strong
powerful
beer
i
can
have
one
glass
enjoyably
this
is
for
sure
a
sipper
but
a
pretty
darn
good
one
for
the
style
its
a
strong
ale
and
it
is
made
to
enjoy
slowly
overall
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
9
a
bottle
warm
the
high
abv
come
through
in
the
mouthfeel
as
soon
as
it
hits
the
tongue
sam
warms
every
surface
it
touches
but
a
creamy
coconut
milk
and
vanilla
softness
soothes
just
as
fast
all
i
can
say
is
wow
this
is
a
truly
outstanding
beer
and
a
definite
sipper
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
distinct
the
flavors
and
the
richer
the
experience
well
worth
the
8
and
the
brain
cells
it
kills
i
cant
wait
to
age
some
d
in
a
field
where
most
other
competitors
are
half
the
alcoholic
strength
this
beer
is
tough
to
come
to
grips
with
when
style
is
concerned
for
what
it
is
samaels
is
a
very
tasty
and
downright
sugarraped
adult
liquid
candy
of
a
beer
it
has
some
complexities
like
a
well
developed
sherry
might
but
in
the
end
the
crazy
sweetness
trumps
pretty
much
every
other
aspect
taste
is
strong
smooth
a
little
sweet
prune
burnt
caramel
toasted
nuts
some
sour
malt
cedar
a
little
sweet
cherry
juice
and
licorice
ends
dry
and
a
little
bitter
fairly
light
color
for
the
boldness
in
taste
the
head
was
more
than
i
expected
for
a
beer
this
strong
too
i
didnt
really
like
the
smell
im
thinking
it
must
be
the
oak
barrel
smell
and
i
just
finished
an
ipa
which
usually
smell
wonderful
to
me
the
taste
is
delicious
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
not
as
much
of
an
alcohol
flavor
for
such
a
high
abv
as
i
expected
but
it
does
finish
with
a
nice
warm
feeling
cherry
and
caramel
highlight
the
flavor
this
is
a
royal
beer
with
a
smooth
finish
nice
aftertaste
and
fairly
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
reminds
me
a
bit
of
samiclaus
but
with
more
of
an
oak
flavor
drinkability
its
going
down
well
for
14
5
abv
but
no
beer
of
this
strength
is
very
drinkabile
imho
sip
one
bottle
over
a
couple
of
hours
and
call
it
a
night
i
still
dont
know
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
very
complex
with
many
flavors
but
yet
extremely
high
abv
very
good
sipping
beer
but
the
flavor
wants
me
to
drink
it
quicker
than
just
sipping
i
love
that
avery
is
doing
this
experimental
barrel
aged
series
i
think
this
one
and
brabant
the
other
one
ive
had
would
benefit
from
some
aging
for
sure
i
will
keep
buying
these
and
apreciate
the
fact
that
avery
is
on
the
cutting
edge
full
sticky
mouthfeel
a
bit
light
on
the
carbonation
and
ends
up
a
little
syrupy
but
damn
if
i
didnt
enjoy
that
snifter
another
solid
experimental
brew
from
avery
samael
is
the
angel
of
death
and
resides
in
seventh
heaven
avery
samaels
ale
makes
me
glad
to
be
alive
and
is
a
truly
heavenly
brew
never
mind
the
7
99
price
tag
for
12
ounces
4
years
ago
this
is
exceptional
beer
that
i
will
now
add
to
my
cellar
whenever
the
opportunity
presents
itself
bottom
line
devilishly
good
d
it
will
take
me
all
night
to
get
through
this
beer
it
must
be
consumed
slowly
and
would
make
a
great
nightcap
notes
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
drinkability
is
like
the
mouthfeel
there
is
too
much
booze
and
alcohol
to
make
this
very
drinkable
its
just
kind
of
messy
and
needs
more
focus
i
personally
would
like
more
malty
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
big
booze
flavors
with
the
oak
woody
finish
one
sip
away
from
empty
i
feel
like
im
hittin
the
hard
stuff
coats
the
mouth
thoroughly
syrupy
not
in
a
bad
way
this
has
warmed
my
stomach
and
my
brain
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
tonight
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
in
oklahoma
in
july
2008
beer
was
bottled
in
april
2008
pours
an
amber
color
with
ruby
hues
no
head
or
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
somewhat
fruity
taste
is
much
more
complex
than
i
thought
it
would
be
sweet
candycaramel
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
and
booze
very
alcoholic
limits
its
drinkability
good
brew
glad
i
picked
it
up
d
i
do
like
this
in
an
odd
self
punishing
way
however
this
is
a
niche
product
it
is
damn
near
fermented
fruit
nectar
and
not
something
your
going
to
finish
quickly
or
have
more
than
one
of
hence
the
score
nice
drinkability
for
15
53
i
remember
having
one
of
these
when
i
was
newly
21
and
loving
it
right
up
to
the
point
when
it
hit
me
upside
the
head
with
its
hidden
potential
very
good
just
too
much
ends
up
being
a
sweet
syrupy
mess
maybe
a
better
palate
than
mine
can
take
the
blows
from
this
one
and
still
stand
up
to
it
just
felt
utterly
unbalanced
this
one
felt
a
bit
young
let
it
sit
for
another
35
years
12
oz
may
be
a
bit
much
as
well
the
drink
is
silky
mediumbodied
and
surprisingly
drinkable
meaning
i
think
ill
be
able
to
finish
the
whole
12ouncer
before
the
core
degenerates
into
the
china
syndrome
from
hell
3
years
of
aging
did
this
beer
a
real
service
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
throw
another
case
in
the
cellar
except
for
the
armleg
price
point
of
this
truly
excellent
brew
worth
trying
actually
only
a
little
evil
damned
tasty
and
truly
superb
with
a
little
age
on
it
definitely
worth
saving
for
future
enjoyment
poured
a
burnt
orange
with
a
small
white
one
head
nose
is
big
malt
hops
and
booze
taste
is
sugary
and
hot
lots
of
caramel
malts
wood
chips
and
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
nice
thick
and
chewy
this
is
one
massive
beer
that
can
bring
down
even
the
heaviest
hitters
i
could
not
consume
another
one
of
these
but
the
one
i
did
drink
was
awesome
not
very
drinkable
its
a
great
beer
but
the
abv
and
strong
flavors
cut
down
on
ones
ability
to
drink
even
a
full
bottle
certainly
a
sipper
a
good
nightcap
but
limited
drinkability
as
expected
due
to
intense
sweetness
and
high
abv
2007
bottling
picked
it
up
for
half
price
to
give
it
a
try
glad
i
did
it
was
a
powerful
blast
of
flavor
im
starting
to
understand
why
the
barrelaged
beers
are
so
popular
i
could
hardly
finish
a
12
oz
split
between
two
people
this
beer
is
a
sipper
but
it
is
worth
trying
if
you
enjoy
oaky
and
yeasty
characters
d
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
tasty
all
around
and
dangerous
i
think
ill
let
the
other
bottle
age
for
a
few
more
years
and
see
if
the
booze
mellows
out
anymore
solid
beer
and
im
glad
to
have
the
girlfriend
here
to
help
me
with
it
the
closest
thing
in
my
experience
that
i
can
compare
this
brew
to
is
great
divides
oakaged
yeti
imperial
stout
though
both
are
very
good
i
prefer
the
yeti
because
the
lower
abv
leaves
room
for
a
more
interesting
flavor
profile
this
is
quite
nice
but
a
little
too
much
like
sipping
bourbon
for
me
nothing
wrong
with
sipping
bourbon
just
that
id
buy
bourbon
and
not
an
ale
for
that
experience
d
well
this
is
a
massive
beer
that
despite
the
high
abv
is
easy
to
drink
especially
if
you
are
in
the
mood
i
would
recommend
some
venom
slayer
or
danzig
for
this
one
very
impressive
and
helps
throw
things
into
a
nice
whirl
the
only
drawback
is
that
it
does
not
come
that
cheap
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
its
not
for
everyone
due
to
its
strength
but
while
strong
it
is
not
overbearing
makes
for
a
great
winter
warmer
but
most
probably
wont
have
more
than
one
out
of
a
bottle
this
mildly
intimidating
beer
14
9
alc
was
a
hazy
deep
amber
color
the
one
finger
head
was
tan
displayed
mediocre
retention
and
modest
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
alcohol
esters
and
heat
oak
ripe
fruit
and
doughy
malt
the
flavors
were
very
rich
and
sweet
the
alcohol
was
also
quite
strong
caramel
malt
kicked
the
door
in
with
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
middle
fruity
esters
and
candy
sugar
were
in
there
too
i
generally
like
sweeter
beers
but
i
kept
feeling
this
one
was
truly
cloying
the
body
was
mediumfull
the
mouthfeel
average
and
the
carbonation
apropos
for
the
style
probably
a
real
gem
when
aged
but
it
would
need
years
drinkable
now
but
it
is
a
bit
hot
and
rough
purchased
at
brawleys
beverage
in
charlotte
very
nice
looking
beer
when
poured
and
honestly
the
coolest
label
ive
every
seen
has
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
and
dark
brown
cloudy
body
theres
little
bits
of
yeast
sediment
in
it
and
probably
due
to
the
age
this
bottle
was
sealed
in
april
07
smell
is
very
malty
little
alcohol
notes
in
there
with
some
oak
flavor
malts
are
thick
and
that
of
sweet
raisens
and
dates
flavor
is
great
tons
of
malts
and
sweet
fruits
alcohol
comes
in
mid
way
through
but
the
sweet
malts
and
little
spiceyness
comes
in
to
counter
it
quickly
love
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
very
murky
rust
color
and
has
a
thin
quickly
fading
head
the
aroma
is
very
boozy
with
big
ripened
fruits
plum
sugary
malts
oak
and
light
band
aid
it
actually
smells
quite
inviting
the
flavor
is
rich
heavy
fermented
fruits
dates
big
malt
and
maple
it
seems
the
appearance
gets
better
as
it
warms
giving
it
a
little
swirl
creates
a
head
and
sticky
lacing
i
have
a
habit
of
drinking
my
beers
too
quickly
but
i
think
this
one
is
going
to
last
me
for
quite
some
time
very
nice
overall
a
true
sipper
d
drink
after
christmas
dinner
we
did
and
we
were
left
impressed
by
this
underrated
brew
i
probably
shouldnt
drink
a
few
of
these
but
i
definitely
would
careful
its
a
hitter
with
a
high
abv
disappointing
pours
brown
with
floaties
suspended
in
the
thick
carbonationfree
liquid
no
head
could
be
forced
from
this
one
aroma
is
very
nice
sweet
and
caramel
with
a
heavy
oak
quality
the
oak
is
very
apparent
in
the
taste
just
as
the
description
points
out
problem
is
it
only
enhances
the
overly
sweet
caramelmalt
of
this
brew
the
alcohol
came
out
as
the
beer
warmed
making
this
stickysweet
syrup
that
became
undrinkable
i
will
try
this
again
and
pray
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
this
time
around
maybe
it
will
have
gone
down
from
its
oppressive
8
a
12oz
price
finish
is
sickly
sweet
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
lots
of
sediment
in
the
body
milky
white
head
on
to
this
dark
orange
almost
brown
beer
very
aromic
its
big
on
oak
and
caramel
a
bit
of
fruity
alcohol
now
i
hope
this
isnt
too
hot
to
handle
damn
im
smoking
fumes
from
my
nose
very
very
mellow
flavor
and
yet
so
darn
tasty
lots
of
oak
and
sweet
candy
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
fruity
it
melts
on
your
palate
very
pleasantly
thats
for
sure
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
but
thats
mostly
in
the
throat
not
on
the
palate
im
loving
this
i
just
wish
there
was
less
sediment
sit
back
and
sip
on
i
am
not
sure
i
have
ever
had
anything
quite
like
this
before
drinks
more
like
hard
liquor
than
beer
very
dark
orange
color
with
a
small
tan
head
very
pungent
nose
of
ripe
fruit
and
oak
smooth
mouthfeel
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
something
the
powerful
flavor
of
caramel
malts
citrus
hops
and
ripe
fruit
probably
not
for
everyone
but
i
enjoyed
it
the
aroma
and
taste
are
so
sweet
you
would
swear
that
there
is
syrup
in
it
very
vinous
as
well
the
appearance
is
golden
orange
flavor
is
oak
like
with
a
somewhat
liquor
quality
palate
is
thick
and
smooth
very
good
even
though
its
really
strong
it
doesnt
knock
out
your
taste
buds
d
although
i
began
to
feel
the
alcohol
before
finishing
the
beer
it
was
certainly
not
harsh
at
all
and
overall
pretty
smooth
given
the
alcohol
content
notes
from
42707
obviously
a
monster
wouldnt
want
to
chug
this
one
but
the
overall
arch
is
that
it
is
really
powerful
the
sum
of
the
parts
is
less
that
the
whole
it
you
know
what
i
mean
i
will
definately
get
this
again
if
i
need
to
catch
a
buzz
but
not
for
the
taste
pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
amber
tints
and
decent
carbonation
leading
to
a
small
head
a
very
thick
smell
of
sweet
malts
and
some
dark
fruits
i
am
not
sure
what
i
smelled
the
aroma
was
all
over
the
place
here
unbelievable
sweet
malt
taste
that
knocks
you
on
your
ass
and
there
seems
to
be
some
floral
hops
to
punctuate
a
vivid
thickness
of
this
beer
and
give
it
a
slightly
hoppy
backend
despite
the
high
abv
the
alcohol
burn
isnt
too
bad
but
this
is
only
a
sipper
and
i
still
couldnt
finish
it
all
it
is
like
drinking
a
milkshake
it
is
so
thick
and
as
it
warms
it
got
a
little
rough
on
my
throat
this
is
a
dessert
beer
to
split
with
somebody
on
a
cold
winter
night
for
a
good
occasion
pours
a
ruby
brown
color
lighter
edges
offwhite
head
frothy
but
small
hoppy
aroma
grapefruit
dark
woodsy
scent
malts
and
alcohol
aroma
of
spices
when
inhaling
deeply
some
sweetness
and
caramel
caramel
and
sweetness
dark
raisiny
taste
spices
clove
sickly
sweet
aftertaste
warming
up
taste
of
something
dark
might
be
the
oak
a
hard
flavor
a
lot
of
alcohol
too
alcoholy
drinkability
very
nice
will
be
having
more
of
these
in
the
future
i
think
they
are
up
to
about
9
each
now
though
which
makes
it
a
rare
buy
okay
so
the
aroma
still
kind
of
puts
me
offentices
me
then
stinks
me
outbut
the
rest
of
this
ale
is
gorgeous
though
not
deceptive
id
love
to
have
another
one
but
know
better
than
that
to
have
another
one
this
one
has
nearly
looped
me
enough
any
more
and
itd
end
in
tears
tears
that
the
prince
of
demons
samael
would
gladly
drink
himself
im
sure
not
this
time
buddy
boy
md
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
not
much
is
left
to
linger
the
strong
sour
smell
and
the
taste
of
strong
alcohol
and
the
fact
of
this
brew
being
14
9
makes
it
hard
to
finish
d
ages
well
many
of
the
flavor
and
aroma
components
are
what
you
might
find
in
an
oakaged
chardonnay
that
has
experienced
malolactic
fermentation
i
guess
they
oak
has
really
influenced
this
beer
d
brewed
to
be
sipped
share
a
bottle
and
take
your
time
music
enjoyed
whilst
sampling
none
but
i
could
hear
some
coming
from
a
party
down
the
street
its
a
light
redamber
color
with
a
small
off
white
creamy
head
that
exits
pretty
quickly
probably
because
the
huge
alcohol
content
this
was
is
very
boozy
smelling
right
of
the
bat
but
past
that
there
is
woody
oak
candied
fruit
slight
vanilla
and
malt
the
taste
is
again
boozy
and
stingingly
strong
with
alcohol
but
there
is
a
very
sweet
candied
malt
and
fruit
to
go
with
the
obvious
oak
flovor
it
has
a
full
and
smooth
body
that
is
quite
nice
unfortunately
its
overwellming
boozyness
detracts
from
the
drinkability
overall
only
once
baby
d
i
am
very
glad
i
picked
up
several
of
these
when
i
had
the
chance
this
is
a
great
beer
to
split
with
friends
at
a
tasting
bottled
april
2007
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
an
impressive
head
considering
the
abv
that
quickly
settles
down
to
patches
and
a
foamy
ring
aroma
is
sugary
cherries
oak
malt
and
some
alcohol
surfacing
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
with
caramel
plums
cherries
lots
of
oak
with
a
spicy
alcoholic
finish
the
beer
is
a
bit
hot
and
a
little
too
sweet
even
for
an
english
barleywine
very
warming
and
definitely
a
sipper
12
ounces
seemed
to
last
forever
i
wouldnt
have
wanted
any
more
not
bad
drinkability
for
being
so
sweet
and
boozy
all
things
considered
liqueurlike
glad
i
chose
it
for
last
nights
nightcap
as
it
sure
made
me
ready
for
a
good
nights
rest
interesting
and
tasty
but
its
a
bit
much
i
wouldnt
have
minded
splitting
this
one
though
its
only
a
12ouncer
d
this
one
is
certainly
a
sipper
i
am
surprised
this
one
is
a
summer
release
since
it
has
much
more
in
common
with
winter
warmers
that
most
summer
brews
the
abv
and
oak
flavor
make
it
tasty
but
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
knock
these
back
one
after
another
i
loved
the
aroma
it
was
sweet
and
figgy
and
of
oak
i
also
got
a
deep
dark
fruit
smell
like
the
taste
was
sweet
wine
like
with
a
oak
chip
finish
it
almost
becomes
cloying
but
walks
the
line
and
remains
nice
and
sweet
on
the
finish
you
get
the
tinge
of
alcohol
and
the
oak
very
nice
overall
a
fun
experience
and
will
buy
one
of
these
every
year
or
every
two
years
so
227
reviews
as
of
my
posting
guess
this
has
been
around
a
wide
area
bottle
notes
this
is
batch
4
over
15
abv
as
noted
on
the
label
and
it
requires
a
very
slow
sipping
approach
to
handle
ive
got
a
couple
more
in
the
cellar
to
age
and
share
with
adventurous
friends
ill
note
its
probably
too
strong
for
me
to
buy
more
two
years
aged
this
poured
a
hazy
burnt
sienna
with
no
head
it
smelled
like
very
strong
dried
apricot
hops
sweet
caramel
malt
melted
butter
and
a
hint
of
oak
and
alcohol
it
tasted
like
powerful
and
sweet
apricot
and
raisin
hops
fresh
cut
oak
super
sugary
caramel
and
blatant
alcohol
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
strong
and
lasting
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
unique
and
bold
ale
that
drank
almost
like
a
cordial
it
was
fairly
complex
but
was
still
clean
its
overwhelming
sweetness
was
reminiscent
of
the
120
minute
ipa
meaning
this
beer
must
be
sipped
and
its
difficult
to
finish
an
entire
bottle
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
full
bodied
this
is
a
winner
poured
a
great
dark
copper
color
with
great
head
and
excellent
lacing
it
had
a
wonderful
aroma
very
fruity

fig
and
grape

a
wonderful
maltiness

go
with

characteristics
fig
mostly
with
a
little

it
went
down
wondefully
smooth
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
fantastic
the
very
sweet
flavor
and
the
high

cut
down
drinkability
slightly
otherwise
quite
enjoyable

me

to
a

ma

vintage
d
because
of
the
sweet
its
a
sipper
drinkability
is
moderate
flavor
is
decent
however
alcohol
is
high
and
it
is
fairly
harsh
definitely
a
sipper
quite
simply
one
of
the
very
best
beers
id
ever
had
and
one
of
the
three
best
ive
ever
had
from
avery
a
triumph
d
the
15
5
abv
is
very
warming
and
demands
some
respect
this
is
a
decent
sipper
as
a
nightcap
not
something
ill
probably
try
again
in
the
summer
heat
but
would
welcome
it
again
on
a
cold
winter
night
an
interesting
brew
that
would
probably
age
well
and
tone
down
nicely
worth
a
try
for
sure
is
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
surprising
actually
it
is
a
sipper
definitely
a
one
a
done
no
need
for
a
second
of
this
brew
md
creamy
full
body
nice
mouthfeel
drinkability
well
this
is
a
big
bold
beer
and
i
dont
know
much
i
could
take
overall
a
very
good
beer
d
possibly
the
best
esa
ive
had
im
pretty
torn
over
this
one
i
really
like
the
nose
and
i
really
like
the
overall
flavor
but
the
alcohol
and
harsh
finish
detract
a
lot
from
my
ability
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
good
in
most
respects
but
kind
of
sharp
interestingly
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
enjoy
it
but
sip
slowly
d
even
tasting
the
alcohol
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
considering
it
makeup
overall
this
is
quite
nice
but
one
that
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
consume
much
at
one
time
a
definite
sipper
pours
a
beautifully
clear
amber
orange
reddish
color
without
much
head
or
lacing
aroma
is
boozy
oakey
sweet
caramel
some
raisins
taste
is
oak
and
bourbon
but
sweet
fruity
caramel
malts
carbonation
is
low
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
sticky
good
brew
definitely
a
sipper
drinkabilty
was
really
high
for
me
in
spite
of
the
crippling
abv
the
taste
is
smooth
and
the
booze
is
clean
and
my
12
ounces
went
down
way
to
fast
i
really
like
english
style
barleywines
though
and
am
really
digging
this
over
the
top
take
on
the
style
by
avery
i
happy
to
say
they
have
another
winner
in
their
the
demons
of
ale
series
3
for
3
with
the
extreme
beers
love
it
part
of
my
high
scoring
reflects
the
level
of
craftsmanship
exhibited
by
pushing
the
envelope
while
still
producing
a
very
tasty
highly
drinkable
product
if
youve
got
em
sit
on
em
overall
very
glad
i
decided
to
purchase
and
sample
this
beer
its
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
general
preferences
but
could
be
good
for
pairing
and
special
tasting
occasions
d
again
age
does
this
beer
wonders
still
a
sipper
though
the
abv
cuts
down
the
drinkability
for
me
but
i
would
not
have
minded
drinking
the
whole
12oz
myself
never
drink
this
fresh
d
this
is
what
is
meant
by
sipper
mouthfeel
is
way
too
heavy
for
easy
drinking
and
the
abv
is
such
that
its
a
good
idea
to
split
a
12oz
bottle
if
you
have
any
desire
to
do
anything
else
during
the
day
a
very
quality
barleywine
and
worth
a
purchase
but
may
be
a
bit
too
expensive
d
overall
this
beer
feels
more
like
a
liquor
on
ice
than
beer
this
beer
is
not
for
a
session
or
even
part
of
a
session
really
but
a
quiet
night
with
a
relaxing
drink
that
youd
just
like
to
sip
and
enjoy
would
probably
be
the
best
setting
the
aging
of
it
probably
helped
bringing
some
of
the
bourbon
to
the
forefront
which
i
enjoyed
with
proper
aging
again
and
another
beautiful
night
i
would
have
again
this
is
the
definition
of
a
sipper
intense
flavors
run
rampant
on
the
palate
and
the
thickness
of
the
body
allows
them
to
stay
beyond
expected
while
most
beers
rush
straight
to
the
aftertaste
this
one
lingers
on
the
tongue
unless
youve
paired
this
beer
with
something
along
the
lines
of
sourdough
bread
it
will
be
some
time
before
you
reach
for
the
glass
again
simply
because
your
tastebuds
wont
be
fully
recovered
yet
additionally
while
alcohol
is
highly
present
in
the
beer
the
abv
still
manages
to
sneak
up
on
you
overall
while
im
not
too
thrilled
about
the
lack
of
balance
it
still
manages
complexity
and
is
definitely
a
unique
albeit
overwhelming
beer
the
drinkability
is
what
i
would
expected
from
a
beer
like
this
one
is
enough
and
i
could
see
most
people
wanting
to
share
one
with
a
friend
or
two
first
experience
with
this
beer
and
probably
my
last
could
age
for
another
two
to
three
years
probably
certainly
not
my
favorite
from
avery
not
recommended
a
little
bit
of
this
would
go
a
long
way
impressive
but
a
single
glass
would
be
all
i
could
ever
drink
d
i
am
probably
being
generous
giving
this
a
3
its
definitely
a
sipper
in
fact
but
im
glad
to
say
ive
had
it

i
like
this
one
and
would
put
it
in
the
rotation
for
winter
beers
definately
a
sipper
to
be
shared
with
a
few
friends
another
unique
tasting
from
avery
great
beer
and
great
take
on
the
barleywine
style
d
a
sipper
of
course
and
pretty
enjoyable
one
not
for
the
weak
of
palate
overall
i
say
this
beer
is
far
to
sweet
and
unbalanced
i
recommend
tasting
this
with
a
friend
or
two
perhaps
4
or
6oz
would
be
the
perfect
amount
but
12oz
alone
is
just
to
much
to
drink
of
this
strong
ale
flavored
with
oak
chips
drinkability
eight
bucks
a
bottle
is
a
stiff
price
to
pay
but
i
like
this
one
and
would
consider
putting
another
one
down
in
storage
d
at
almost
15abv
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
to
enjoy
over
time
i
can
only
imagine
how
wonderful
this
would
be
with
a
few
more
years
of
aging
i
am
a
big
fan
of
avery
and
this
may
be
my
current
favorite
from
this
brewery
interestingly
drinkable
given
the
rocket
fuel
level
abv
however
while
there
is
slightly
detectable
alcohol
in
the
taste
and
aroma
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
yet
ballsy
and
fascinating
beer
i
love
the
expressive
nose
in
this
barley
wine
which
is
why
i
rated
it
exceptional
in
that
category
one
fine
brew
and
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
available
highly
recommended
drinkability
alcohol
presence
was
there
but
not
harsh
i
felt
this
beer
was
just
too
sweet
for
my
liking
12
oz
was
too
much
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
and
was
definitely
interesting

pours
a
cloudy

retention
is

the

is

the

very
very

it
tastes

brown

vanilla
figs

oak
its
a
very
malty
tasting
beer
i
cant
taste
any
hops
at
all
thats
not
a
bad
thing
in
this
case
mouthfeel
is
full
its
thick
and
syrupy
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
considering
the
abv
and
the
sweetness
i
think
this
beer
has
aged
pretty
well
im
disappointed
that
this
is
the
only
bottle
i
had
im
drinking
this
faster
than
i
should
but
i
think
its
pretty
good
it
really
should
be
a
sipping
beer
just
because
of
the
abv
id
definitely
recommend
this
to
others
but
maybe
age
it
a
while
before
drinking
it
pours
into
a
snifter
a
beautiful
light
golden
color
with
no
head
by
the
time
the
beer
arrived
at
our
table
smell
is
malt
sugary
caramel
molasses
alcohol
and
strong
oak
notes
taste
is
of
nutmeg
alcohol
some
dried
fruit
in
the
distance
mouthfeeling
is
smooth
like
a
fine
cognac
and
a
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
chest
is
present
as
well
very
sticky
mouthfeeling
absolutely
very
nice
beer
enjoyed
every
sip
wow
maybe
i
should
have
aged
this
a
little
bit
longer
the
oak
flavor
in
this
was
overpowering
it
was
almost
like
biting
into
an
oak
tree
still
delicious
though
very
dark
amber
in
color
with
not
much
head
oak
raisin
and
other
dark
fruits
in
aroma
very
sugary
the
alcohol
is
also
noticeably
present
d
awesome
this
beer
would
be
perfect
after
dinner
it
warms
your
tummy
overall
to
say
i
was
impressed
would
be
putting
it
lightly
i
am
usually
one
for
big
brews
just
tend
to
back
off
when
they
get
this
big
this
one
however
really
seemed
to
hold
its
own
it
was
soo
mellowed
and
drinkable
it
was
almost
a
shame
i
did
not
have
another
although
that
is
probably
a
good
thing
i
wish
i
had
aged
more
then
one
as
this
was
really
quite
nice
and
was
perfect
over
the
course
of
a
couple
hours
to
just
sit
and
relax
with
definitly
recommend
trying
this
one
pours
a
ruddy
orangey
copper
color
with
virtually
no
head
other
that
a
thin
collar
around
the
inside
of
the
snifter
some
green
apple
aromas
sugary
maltiness
oak
and
possibly
some
spices
but
dull
flavor
is
mostly
sweet
malt
with
some
nuances
of
oak
shining
through
a
slight
cideriness
amidst
the
big
alcohol
kick
oak
chips
adds
to
its
smoothness
and
takes
a
little
edge
off
this
big
beer
an
enjoyable
slow
sipper
very
thick
a
definite
sipper
beer
due
to
its
massive
body
and
alcohol
presence
massive
complexity
makes
this
something
you
have
to
take
your
time
with
i
would
like
to
drink
a
lot
more
of
this
though
pours
a
ruby
hued
brown
with
a
finger
of
creamy
light
tan
head
that
dies
quickly
leaving
sheets
of
lace
smells
of
sweet
bourbon
oak
cherry
and
malt
stings
the
nose
taste
is
very
sweet
boozy
with
a
sherry
character
the
oak
chips
are
prominant
syrupy
and
spicy
full
and
sticky
in
the
mouth
a
gynormous
brew
that
must
be
sipped
spurratically
would
be
very
interested
to
revisit
one
of
these
after
aging
a
few
years
as
there
are
many
flavors
but
all
buried
by
the
booze
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
ale
but
not
a
great
one
so
that
limits
its
drinkability
for
me
but
it
also
has
a
very
high
abv
which
alone
makes
this
a
sipper
and
not
sessionable
drinkability
a
tough
one
to
consume
i
dont
mind
sweet
beers
as
much
as
some
but
this
one
lacks
complexity
toos
strong
for
my
enjoyment
especially
at
lunchtime
but
a
wellmade
beer
that
does
a
good
job
of
minimizing
yhe
high
alcohol
sensation
mouthfeel
it
has
an
appropriate
amount
of
carbonation
but
its
so
sweet
its
hard
to
drink
and
with
the
very
high
alcohol
content
this
is
a
sipper
has
characteristics
of
a
tawny
port
great
evening
brew
overall
impressions
i
like
it
but
probably
just
this
once
the
alcohol
is
overwhelming
at
times
overall
i
would
call
it
unique
this
is
a
big
flavored
beer
tons
of
oak
and
booze
if
i
did
not
know
any
beer
i
would
think
the
glass
contains
bourbon
it
is
very
sweet
i
like
it
but
i
could
see
how
it
would
be
over
the
top
in
sweetness
for
most
it
is
not
sessionable
at
all
i
sipped
the
entire
bottle
it
left
me
warm
and
happy
there
are
many
better
brews
out
there
and
several
better
by
avery
but
this
one
is
unique
if
you
have
not
tried
it
grab
one
and
give
it
a
shot
its
an
experience
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
any
more
of
this
one
bottled
may
2006
batch
2
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thin
head
that
is
still
much
more
than
youd
expect
for
a
beer
this
strong
spotty
lacing
lasts
on
my
stone
old
guardian
glass
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
alcohol
and
sweet
caramel
with
a
hint
of
oak
the
taste
is
very
complex
but
the
general
medicinelike
alcohol
gets
in
the
way
there
is
a
good
blend
of
oak
vanilla
caramel
and
a
nice
but
sharp
pine
hoppiness
provides
the
best
backbone
it
can
for
all
that
malt
the
beer
is
very
heavy
on
the
palate
and
very
sweet
this
is
one
that
takes
a
long
time
to
drink
and
pretty
much
leaves
me
ready
to
go
to
bed
d
a
real
sipper
its
a
brut
but
i
like
it
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
brownruby
color
the
head
is
massive
billowy
thick
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
thick
lacing
and
leaves
foam
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
dates
plums
hints
of
caramel
maple
syrup
smoke
and
oak
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
good
australian
rare
tokay
the
taste
is
a
mirror
image
of
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
really
like
this
beer
it
borders
into
dessert
wine
territory
but
does
a
fine
job
of
it
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
well
this
ages
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
that
is
more
balanced
than
the
other
barleywines
ive
tried
to
date
high
alcohol
is
hidden
well
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark

nice

nice

nice
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
sweet
malty
bourbon
oaky
and
nice
touch
of

the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
very
nice
touch
of
bourbon
oak
some
caramel
the
abv
is
hidden
well
for
this
brew
nice
warm
feeling
going
down
medium
body
very
well
done
brew
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nicetasty
barleywine
one
of
the
best
ive
had
to
date
highly
recommended
i
was
very
suprised
to
find
this
beer
so
easy
to
drink
the
oak
comes
through
nicely
and
even
with
the
high
alchol
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
intend
to
cellar
a
few
and
revisit
them
in
a
few
years
im
sure
the
malt
will
continue
to
mellow
nicely
avery
has
made
a
nice
sipper
here
great
one
to
have
on
a
cold
winters
night
if
you
like
barleywines
this
is
a
musttry
d
fair
warning
you
could
choke
on
this
beer
if
you
do
more
than
sip
it
very
potent
stuff
complex
but
i
think
avery
went
to
far
with
this
one
worth
a
drink
though
its
a
tough
one
to
drink
my
heartfelt
thanks
to
beerbeing
for
this
brew
sent
in
the
ba

club
lucious

is
rich
and
sweet
faint
vanilla

a
bit
hot
mouth
is
thick
and
viscous
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
reminds
me
more
of
an
old
ale
in
flavor
perhaps
rich
and
complex
a
fine
sipper
bleagh
i
find
myself
unable
to
finish
the
last
23rds
of
this
too
sweet
by
half
notes
i
liked
this
almost
exactly
the
same
as
the
2005
version
as
its
identical
to
my
palate
i
put
almost
a
year
on
this
bottle
of
2006
and
that
seems
about
perfect
to
me
it
still
has
that
spicey
alcohol
edge
and
the
only
difference
is
in
the
malt
bill
as
it
settled
into
a
thicker
more
complex
body
drinkability
this
is
a
sipper
and
the
abv
will
keep
this
from
being
something
i
return
to
time
and
time
again
i
feel
like
having
more
hops
would
help
balance
the
beer
bottle
courtesy
of
boboski
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
little
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
brown
sugar
is
domination
with
some
subtle
alcohol
signs
taste
is
dominated
by
some
very
sweet
malt
with
very
little
hops
and
also
very
little
signs
of
oak
alcohol
was
way
too
predominant
and
the
beer
was
way
too
sweet
for
my
personal
taste
it
seems
that
avery
big
beers
series
are
either
hit
or
miss
and
this
one
would
be
a
miss
d
its
so
complex
so
sweet
and
so
alcoholic
that
you
cant
drink
much
unless
youre
a
fan
of
beers
such
as
eku
28
if
you
get
the
chance
try
this
beer
but
share
it
drinkability

this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
samples
from
the
avery
booze
dungeon
it
didnt
get
a
stellar
rating
but
i
will
buy
occasionally
drinks
alright
the
dryness
smokeyness
detract
some
ill
take
this
over
the
beast
or
the
devil
stout
mestophiles
any
day
this
is
a
special
big
hitter
in
my
book
id
certainly
purchase
this
again
if
given
the
chance
its
not
that
i
wasnt
impressed
with
samaels
drinkability
but
theres
simply
too
much
going
on
in
this
beer
the
alcohol
and
aromatics
overpower
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
the
beer
was
it
worth
the
7
95
that
i
paid
i
dont
believe
so
is
it
a
bad
beer
no
but
next
time
i
think
ill
reach
for
a
bottle
of
scotch
instead
a
slight
burn
and
this
brew
slides
down
to
a
worth
a
try
beer
interesting
though
poured
straight
down
the
center
of
the
glass
into
a
nonic
the
head
is
rather
tight
sits
an
inch
thick
with
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
the
body
is
a
deep
slightly
hazy
reddish
orange
smells
of
sweet
malt
lots
of
esters
tropical
fruity
some
banana
candies
pear
plum
port
like
scents
sugar
and
little
cinnamon
alcohol
is
present
but
not
over
powering
the
hops
are
a
little
over
overwhelmed
in
the
nose
the
taste
sweet
rich
body
with
nice
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
being
too
syrupy
the
hops
come
out
in
the
middle
with
a
little
bitterness
and
some
alcohol
warmth
to
finish
the
oak
can
be
experience
much
more
as
it
worms
up
very
slight
but
nice
nuance
this
is
a
tasty
barley
wine
approachable
but
definitely
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
a
syrupy
sweet
yet
complex
punch
in
the
face
try
it
for
crap
sake
whoa
this
is
a
big
beer
there
is
a
sharp
sweetness
that
i
dont
care
for
various
sugary
flavors
running
rampant
this
is
simply
not
ready
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
to
say
that
it
is
coating
doesnt
come
close
to
explaining
it
not
drinkable
by
a
long
shot
brewed
in
may
2006
pours
clear
and
orangeamber
with
a
surprisingly
large
head
for
something
this
alcoholic
big
vanilla
aromas
not
surprising
considering
its
flavored
with
american
oak
chips
but
also
a
compelling
mango
aroma
some
butter
and
spice
on
the
palate
initially
just
a
touch
acidic
and
fruity
the
mango
again
comes
to
the
fore
along
with
some
apricots
before
growing
sweeter
and
sweeter
through
the
finish
which
stays
sharply
and
cloyingly
sweet
its
not
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
theres
a
burst
of
fruit
and
raw
alcohol
at
the
end
substantial
carbonation
throughout
the
palate
which
is
kind
of
surprising
given
the
style
overall
this
is
rather
good
im
surprised
i
liked
it
as
much
as
i
did
the
vanilla
oakiness
wasnt
too
overbearing
as
it
was
attenuated
by
some
fruit
the
carbonation
also
helped
it
from
becoming
too
heavy
not
bad
at
all
and
certainly
original
my
rough
plan
is
to
drink
a
bottle
a
year
for
the
next
five
years
but
i
have
very
serious
doubts
itll
last
that
long
ummm
anyone
out
there
who
wants
to
trade
some
truly
unique
rare
big
beer
like
dark
lord
utopias
millennium
etc
beermail
me
i
love
this
stuff
it
might
well
be
one
of
my
five
favorite
beers
in
the
world
out
of
well
over
a
thousand
ive
tasted
this
beer
is
thick
and
oily
not
much
carbonation
not
very
drinkable
too
sweet
too
much
of
an
alcohol
burn
its
worth
giving
a
shot
this
is
remarkably
mellow
the
sweet
elements
and
huge
alcohol
thankfully
dont
dominate
no
doubt
helped
by
the
9
months
in
the
bottle
and
it
would
be
probably
still
be
quite
drinkable
at
ten
times
that
age
its
a
pricey
bastard
8
49
per
12
oz
bottle
but
because
its
so
damn
good
and
lasts
as
long
as
a
22
ouncer
id
purchase
it
again

here
we

semicloudy

that
dissapears

apple
orange
grapefruit
red
wine
port
oak
raisin
the
only
down
side
of
the
nose
is
how
faint
it
is
i
had
to
cover
the
glass
with
my
hand
and
inhale
deeply
to
get
all
these
nuances
not
a
fill
the
room
nose
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
the
taste
which
i
can
say
right
off
the
bat
would
benefit
from
some
serious
aging
this
is
huge
real
big
tremendous
amount
of
malt
and
sweet
raisins
everything
fromt

is

along
with
some

and

you

there
truly
amazing
wine
inthe
nose
beer
int
he
mouth
despite
its
schwartzenegger
approach
to
attacking
my
palate
it
actually
finishes
quite
cleanly
the
warmth
is
still
there
but
its
not
cloying
or
distractive
its
pleasent
i
cant
believe
how
drinkable
this
is
a
barleywine
that
will
certainly
satisfy
your
sweet
tooth
thanks
to
quaffer
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
insanely
sweet
at
first
with
flavors
of
overripe
fig
and
belgian
candied
sugar
gives
way
to
hot
alcohol
sherrylike
in
its
nuttiness
subtle
oaked
nuances
are
present
throughout
lending
the
beer
a
vanilla
aspect
though
they
never
dominate
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
viscous
and
as
you
let
this
warm
in
the
mouth
it
takes
on
a
distinct
chardonnay
oaked
quality
a
touch
too
sweet
but
intriquing
nonetheless
super
sticky
thick
and
mild
carbonation
im
tempted
to
dilute
this
with
water
to
make
it
more
drinkable
because
as
is
im
having
a
hard
time
definitely
a
sipper
i
will
reserve
this
for
that
quiet
time
at
the
end
of
the
day
12
oz
bottle
that
i
purchased
six
months
ago
and
paid
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
well
not
really
but
7
is
a
lot
to
me
for
one
beer
the
color
is
a
really
nice
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
2
cm
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
of
hioctane
alcohol
and
not
much
else
as
papa
burgundy
would
say
stings
the
nostrils
the
taste
is
very
close
to
whiskey
with
a
little
sweetness
this
is
not
quite
as
bad
as
mephistopheles
but
it
isnt
great
this
really
isnt
a
beer
to
me
but
more
an
afterdinner
liqueur
like
a
cognac
or
bourbon
this
is
way
too
big
for
me
and
not
recommended
unless
you
like
liquorbeers
the
only
reason
i
cracked
this
was
because
i
spent
four
hours
in
traffic
due
to
a
blizzard
and
my
belly
needed
warming
this
beer
is
good
for
that
also
on
a
positive
note
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
slightly
fizzy
yet
thick
however
not
too
sticky
kinda
creamy
and
drinkability
for
this
abv
is
decent
although
i
think
thats
due
to
the
sweetness
here
not
sure
that
heaps
of
turbinado
sugar
is
a
proper
way
to
skillfully
mask
abv
but
whatever
probably
wont
revisit
a
third
time
twice
was
puhlenty
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
it
sort
of
tastes
like
an
english
barleywine
reduction
its
just
so
syrupy
sweet
its
almost
hard
to
drink
but
its
still
very
good
definitely
a
beer
to
share
even
for
12oz
thank
god
i
was
able
to
split
a
small
bottle
of
this
with
the
crowd
at
the
coastal
wine
connections
beer
tasting
this
destroys
your
olfactory
senses
with
a
big
sugary
caramel
pow
powerfully
sweet
with
a
cooked
fruit
sweetness
just
a
light
bitter
or
medicinal
value
its
incredibly
smooth
but
with
the
power
of
a
nuclear
power
plant
bronze
orange
this
is
the
eiswein
of
beer
almost
a
cognac
for
sipping
by
the
fire
with
a
cigar

cheers
this
is
one
overpowering
beer
and
one
of
the
highest
abvs
ive
sampled
small
bottle
but
even
that
was
hard
to
finish
i
will
probably
get
some
more
for
special
occasions
though
thanks
to
enola
for
the
experiance
mmmm
this
a
killer
diller
but
not
impossible
to
like
full
flavored
full
bodied
long
fruity
boozy
finish
and
wholly
unique
update
dumped
this
down
the
sink
couldnt
finish
bleh
d
i
wont
look
for
this
again
and
i
should
have
drank
only
half
way
too
sweet
deep
reddish
orange
amber
body
is
very
attractive
almost
3
fingers
of
fat
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
as
it
fades
nose
is
vibrant
with
spicey
fruit
notes
creamy
vanilla
hints
also
exist
super
sweet
syrupy
feel
coats
the
mouth
at
first
sip
kind
of
like
a
thin
port
carmeled
malts
and
soured
sweetness
dominate
the
palate
you
catch
notes
of
plum
and
waxy
cherry
candy
alchol
warms
the
belly
well
but
is
well
hidden
in
the
taste
nice
sipping
style
quite
drinkable
but
only
one
at
a
time
wow
i
really
am
not
sure
i
even
want
to
finish
this
beer
its
just
not
that
good
i
actually
felt
inclined
to
write
this
solely
because
this
beer
was
so
poor
kind
of
a
scarlet
red
hue
carbonation
is
visible
in
the
murkiness
of
the
beer
it
slowly
surfaces
to
a
thin
crop
of
tan
head
lace
is
minimal
aroma
is
very
sweet
rich
feel
to
it
some
fruitiness
underneath
all
the
sweets
candied
plums
and
tropical
varieties
come
to
mind
on
the
palate
its
sweet
up
front
but
not
cloying
as
i
feared
its
very
rich
overall
the
finish
brings
a
little
heat
but
again
not
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
this
beer
is
put
together
pretty
nicely
its
got
lots
of
those
tropical
fruits
dancing
around
like
pineapples
and
mango
and
maybe
some
papaya
and
even
a
ghostly
coconut
presence
cherry
and
nougat
and
oak
strike
as
well
the
beer
has
a
nice
bit
of
carbonation
to
it
to
prevent
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
body
is
checking
in
around
medium
maybe
mediumfull
this
is
pretty
good
for
being
such
a
heavyweight
this
is
a
very
strong
ale
i
wouldnt
recommend
drinking
it
out
of
anything
other
than
a
snifter
or
tulip
or
another
small
glass
that
enhances
aromas
and
promotes
slow
sipping
perhaps
even
taking
small
sips
out
of
a
shotglass
is
appropriate
all
i
could
do
was
take
small
sips
and
let
the
flavor
soak
in
i
recommend
starting
out
at
a
temperature
of
4045
degrees
as
this
will
take
a
while
to
enjoy
i
feel
if
it
gets
too
warm
the
alcohol
may
become
too
overpowering
and
turn
a
great
beer
into
paint
thinner
flavored
soda
dont
be
intimidated
by
this
barley
wines
high
alcohol
by
volume
as
the
complexity
makes
up
for
it
this
is
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
alone
among
the
melodies
of
your
favorite
relaxation
music
or
shared
with
friends
to
calm
the
night
this
one
gets
my
full
respect
thats
my
opinion
anyway
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
about
with
half
the
heat
i
will
not
purchase
again
im
a
likin
this
brew
this
could
be
my
favorite
avery
brew
since
avery
10
there
is
a
lot
of
portwine
characteristics
in
this
beer
shy
with
the
hops
this
barley
wine
ascends
the
style
in
which
it
is
characterized
very
sweet
syrupy
and
oily
looking
right
from
the
offset
with
a
deep
mohogany
hue
and
a
stark
white
head
it
promises
intense
sweetness
and
richness
aromas
of
sweet
brandylike
alcohols
swirled
around
toffee
caramel
vanilla
rum
and
bourbon
i
think
it
is
the
oak
tastes
even
sweeter
than
is
suggested
by
the
aromas
a
follow
up
of
rumsoaken
cherries
berries
maple
syrup
and
heavy
heavy
malts
not
teethhurting
sweet
but
close
high
fruitcake
flavors
with
the
dehydrated
old
fruits
and
sugar
drenched
breads
heavy
and
sweet
on
the
mouth
this
one
is
surely
a
sipper
very
warming
without
fusals
and
with
a
sweet
alcohol
oily
feel
finishes
like
a
lot
of
dark
rums
and
tawny
ports
that
i
have
drank
this
beer
is
phenominal
better
than
samichlaus
in
my
opinion
pours
a
syrupy
deep
burnt
orange
color
with
no
head
aroma
is
rumsoaked
raisins
oak
fruity
esters
of
apple
and
pear
slight
bubblegum
and
alcohol
dryness
flavor
is
syrupy
sweet
of
caramel
malts
honey
raisins
bananas
foster
french
oak
and
vanilla
peppery
and
spicy
notes
in
the
dry
finish
very
warm
from
the
14
5
alcohol
full
body
low
carbonation
and
definitely
a
sipper
smells
of
dark
caramel
cherries
sweet
candy
sugar
taste
is
very
malty
sweet
with
hops
enough
to
back
it
up
super
lingering
sweetness
with
tones
of
dark
fruit
raisins
cherries
very
mild
carbonation
cloying
sweetness
as
expected
for
a
14
abv
thick
and
sweet
just
a
sipping
brew
great
for
dessert
this
brew
is
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
faint
haze
and
a
thickly
packed
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
fascinating
intense
character
of
hops
and
alcohol
mingled
with
spicy
phenols
fruit
vanilla
and
wood
its
a
complex
aroma
with
nothing
subtle
about
it
the
smell
is
a
little
jumbled
and
lacks
the
a
real
wellcrafted
roundednessstill
theres
a
lot
of
great
aromas
in
there
there
taste
is
intensely
sweet
with
an
immediate
warming
very
malty
and
sugary
it
can
get
a
little
cloying
and
could
be
a
little
more
balanced
still
its
a
solidly
strong
and
enjoyable
flavor
againnothing
subtle
here
full
and
thick
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
given
the
abv
id
certainly
have
one
of
these
again
overall
this
is
an
interesting
experiment
if
this
were
a
homebrew
id
like
it
more
but
its
just
too
out
there
and
too
expensive
for
me
id
only
recommend
this
for
those
who
want
to
try
beers
that
push
the
limits
of
what
we
think
of
as
beer
oa
i
like
it
ok
i
would
reach
for
a
jw
any
day
over
this
maybe
in
a
big
handful
of
years
this
will
be
more
refined
overall
this
beer
is
ok
i
hate
to
say
it
but
sometimes
i
am
not
overly
fond
of
the
whiskey
flavor
of
barrel
aged
beers
sorry
d
the
drinkability
is
severely
limited
by
the
abv
as
well
as
the
cloying
sweetness
drinkability
not
so
hot
probably
wont
be
having
anymore
of
these
d
way
to
sweet
and
strong
for
me
the
flavors
are
not
well
collected
imo
i
dont
think
is
to
good
at
all
which
is
a
huge
let
down
at
7
a
bottle
pours
a
clear
reddish
orange
with
a
smallish
white
head
not
badbut
nothing
really
special
either
the
smell
is
extremely
pungent
with
oak
wood
burbandark
fruit
and
a
ton
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
sugary
sweet
with
bourban
oak
wood
dark
fruit
and
vanilla
this
is
sooo
sweet
its
hard
to
drink
and
with
the
very
high
alcohol
this
is
a
sipper
the
mf
is
heavy
with
the
flavors
mixing
oknot
greatbut
ok
a
tough
beer
to
drink
i
think
ill
be
sipping
this
all
night
zzzzzz
cheers
drinkability
is
nice
but
certainly
not
anything
other
than
a
snifter
type
beer
one
in
a
sitting
is
all
id
want
but
i
will
certainly
visit
this
one
again

vanilla

thick

overly

with

to

this
one
out
very
warming
as
well
this
was
interesting
to
try
but
i
could
have
split
a
bottle
with
someone
i
am
proud
as
all
hell
about
finding
this
bottle
we
were
in
specs
in
houston
and
i
was
perusing
the
avery
shelf
when
i
saw
a
little
red
foil
topped
bottle
with
no
label
but
on
the
shelf
there
was
a
tag
that
said
avery
oak
aged
ale
so
i
hassled
a
storekeep
to
put
a
upc
on
it
so
i
could
buy
it
no
idea
how
old
it
was
but
i
suspect
fairly
old
because
of
how
delicious
it
was
poured
red
like
a
dark
wine
very
small
flimsy
head
and
not
any
ral
carbonation
stinky
grapemuskoak
smell
very

very

flavor
very
complex
and
hard
to
parse
apart
the
flavors
there
was
a
lot
more
in
there
that
im
not
able
to
identify
somewhat
sour
very
mellow
overall
and
super
delicious
maybe
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
d
hard
to
drink
the
12oz
by
myself
tastes
and
smells
great
but
i
cant
handle
all
the
flavors
and
alcohol
may
be
better
after
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
drinkability
is
just
not
really
in
this
flavor
level
is
like
a
bass
subwoofer
that
nearly
shakes
a
car
apart
some
is
good
but
too
much
can
destroy
too
powerful
for
regular
consumption
d
i
could
drink
1
or
2
of
these
but
i
am
sure
the
14
5
would
make
me
pay
for
any
more
that
that
at
a
conference
in
collinsville
with
my
boss
and
picked
this
up
from
a
nearby
liquor
store
unfortunately
had
no
glassware
so
had
to
resort
to
a
plastic
cup
in
the
room
so
i
wont
be
talking
about
the
head
or
appearance
too
much
this
was
a
pleasant
suprise
smell
alternated
between
a
sweet
malty
beer
to
a
jack
and
coke
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
taste
was
delicious
complex
molasses
with
hints
of
plums
cherries
and
raisins
subtly
arriving
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
warming
quickly
with
the
alcohol
yes
the
alcohol
is
present
but
it
really
didnt
seem
to
be
overpowering
even
at
14
5abv
finishes
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
i
usually
expect
more
hops
from
a
barleywine
but
it
was
still
delicious
daddy
recommends
drinkability
soso
this
may
be
better
with
some
aging
but
the
alcohol
bite
just
becomes
overwhelming
and
tiring
here
you
cant
sip
this
small
enough
to
keep
the
sweetness
and
size
in
check
its
reasonably
complex
with
various
elements
daring
to
brave
the
profound
sweetness
the
abv
is
obvious
at
every
stop
and
only
a
fool
would
ignore
it
perhaps
its
a
bit
too
big
and
too
sweet
but
each
lipcoating
sip
was
easy
enough
at
least
at
the
start
its
the
end
of
the
pint
that
presents
the
dilemma
overall
mouth
feel
lingers
in
various
parts
of
my
throat
tongue
an
interesting
change
of
pace
but
not
one
im
planning
to
try
again
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
the
slippery
front
is
just
that
making
for
a
seemingly
innocent
session
at
first
but
then
it
begins
to
sink
its
teeth
into
you
and
the
14
5
makes
its
way
through
for
a
slower
session
it
has
good
character
but
somehow
lacks
the
power
complexity
and
the
beefy
hops
i
tend
to
like
out
of
a
barleywine
especially
if
its
to
be
of
the
american
style
2005
vintage
pours
dark
copper
to
amber
in
color
with
an
almost
nonexistant
cream
head
that
is
faint
and
brief
a
very
rich
prune
and
raisin
aroma
mix
with
a
boozy
aroma
there
is
also
some
fruit
aromas
cherryapple
cider
like
qualities
taste
shows
incredibly
sweet
maltiness
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
prunes
and
grapes
and
a
nice
spicy
alcohol
finish
that
is
nice
and
warming
medium
to
heavy
in
body
there
is
some
serious
alcohol
in
this
one
and
it
is
pretty
assertive
in
the
aroma
and
taste
but
in
a
good
way
imo
the
sweetness
can
also
be
fairly
cloying
but
i
enjoy
sipping
this
one
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
with
chinese
food
esp
a
rich
mandarin
sauce
slightly
hazy
amber
orange
in
color
small
head
died
to
a
film
rather
quickly
but
hey
its
14
5
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
plenty
of
deep
dark
fruits
cherries
and
plums
the
taste
is
thick
and
syrupy
sweet
a
sherrylike
sting
from
the
smokey
oak
aged
alcohol
even
some
lighter
sweeter
fruity
flavors
as
it
warms
reminded
me
a
bit
of
white
grapes
eventhough
its
at
14
5
alcohol
it
really
isnt
more
noticable
than
other
beers
that
are
around
8
or
9
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
sticky
and
a
bit
cloying
but
not
too
bad
for
how
sweet
the
beer
is
this
beer
would
probably
benefit
from
a
year
or
two
of
cellaring
this
is
a
sipping
beer
not
something
to
enjoy
a
couple
of
when
out
with
the
boys
notes
could
be
beter
could
be
worse
but
not
worth
8
bucks
for
12
ounces
with
so
many
better
barleywines
out
there
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
but
most
definately
a
sipper
to
accompany
dinner
or
to
have
as
a
desert
itself
pours
an
brownish
amber
color
with
a
small
semi
white
head
that
dissapears
fast
to
a
thin
ring
around
my
glass
the
smell
is
of
lots
of
vanilla
some
oak
caramel
brown
sugar
maybe
a
hint
of
dried
fruit
and
oh
yeah
alcohol
the
taste
was
of
mostly
sweet
caramel
malt
and
vanilla
with
more
whiskey
like
qualaties
than
in
the
smell
there
is
only
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
which
makes
this
beer
seem
very
thick
the
oak
only
comes
into
play
a
tiny
bit
as
it
is
drowned
out
by
the
heavy
dose
of
alcohol
the
flavors
seem
to
be
rough
around
the
edges
with
some
of
the
sweetness
needing
just
as
much
mellowing
as
the
whiskey
all
in
all
this
is
one
to
sit
on
for
a
few
years
if
the
whiskey
like
flavors
develop
well
this
will
be
a
whopper
of
a
beer
2005
bottling
this
pours
into
the
glass
a
clear
amber
color
there
was
just
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
that
was
gone
almost
instantly
the
aroma
is
quite
potent
there
is
a
big
sweetness
to
it
vanilla
is
the
main
component
with
some
caramel
and
alcohol
also
the
taste
is
a
bit
syrupy
and
sweet
alcohol
is
evident
im
not
sure
where
the
oak
chips
come
into
this
one
i
think
that
this
needs
to
sit
for
quite
awhile
it
should
be
good
in
a
few
years
overall
not
as
harsh
as
i
was
led
to
believe
by
others
or
for
that
matter
even
expected
especially
given
that
this
is
a
14
5
abv
brewanderm
well
not
to
be
too
shy
or
to
put
too
fine
a
point
it
an
avery
brew
maybe
the
batch
2
is
not
as
harsh
as
the
batch
1
but
it
could
still
do
with
some
time
in
the
bottle
i
think
like
most
of
the
avery
brews
a
big
hitter
and
an
interesting
detour
into
überbeergeek
land
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
worth
trying
though
if
you
have
the
money
to
splash
cuz
at
50
cents
a
fluid
ounce
it
aint
cheap
mainly
clear
bright
polished
copper
appearance
does
generate
a
head
yellowish
and
of
average
duration
laces
in
simple
dripping
rings
aroma
works
lots
of
wood
and
a
strong
vanilla
presence
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
average
carbonation
not
too
syrupy
but
slightly
sticky
but
more
bubbles
than
i
expected
flavor
has
a
distracting
alcoholic
bite
not
as
much
raw
kerosene
as
the
beast
but
a
little
heavygoing
vanilla
continues
in
the
taste
charred

nectarines
golden
delicious
apples
lots
of
residual
sugars
hops
dont
come
into
play
i
never
really
think
these
types
of
beer
are
close
to
bourbon
but
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
in
the
finish
and
in
the
stomach
taking
away
from
the
next
sip
and
the
second
half
of
the
flavor
profile
medium
to
full
body
syrupy
describes
it
best
with
low
carbonation
considering
the
abv
this
is
remarkable
smooth
and
well
balanced
everything
melds
together
nicely
nice
alcohol
warming
and
i
actually
find
it
very
easy
going
down
certainly
not
sessionable
but
definately
something
ill
have
more
of
in
the
future
my
only
qualm
would
be
why
is
this
a
seasonal
in
the
dead
of
summer
this
would
be
an
ideal
winter
beer
drinkabilitynotes
simply
put
superb
a
must
try
pours
an
intense
amber
that
is
slightly
hazy
and
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
dissapates
quickly
14
5
will
kill
head
retention
the
aroma
is
an
intense
mix
of
whiskey
and
caramel
notes
along
with
some
oak
and
vanilla
molasses
fruits
plum
grape
apple
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
equally
intense
as
the
aroma
notes
of
caramel
and
single
malt
scotch
prevail
as
well
as
dark
fruits
cherries
plums
figs
grapes
oak
and
vanilla
slight
mineraly
hops
and
of
course
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
carbonation
is
minimal
and
drinkability
is
bad
at
best
a
very
interesting
beer
reminds
me
of
a
good
single
malt
with
some
maple
syrup
added
avery
is
always
pushing
the
limits
of
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
dark
cherry
red
body
with
a
small
cap
of
white
foam
big
fruit
sweetness
with
plenty
of
sugar
coming
through
as
well
to
the
point
of
being
cloying
alcohol
was
also
pretty
much
in
your
face
after
this
warmed
a
bit
taste
was
more
sugary
syrup
coated
fruits
with
not
much
else
to
provide
any
sort
of
balance
through
the
syrupy
sticky
sweetness
the
strong
alcohol
still
manages
to
come
through
and
provide
a
burn
on
the
way
down
too
much
sweetness
with
only
boozy
notes
to
counter
it
pretty
damn
thick
as
expected
but
way
to
sticky
and
too
much
burning
warmth
drinkability
was
just
about
non
existent
as
i
slowly
drank
the
12
once
bottled
over
a
few
hours
easily
the
sweetest
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
dont
think
ill
touch
my
other
bottle
for
5
years
this
one
is
a
bugger
i
found
it
difficult
to
purchase
because
of
the
high
pricevolume
ratio
but
thought
i
needed
a
little
adventure
after
pouring
it
into
a
glass
little
head
forms
with
no
lacing
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
to
say
the
least
until
i
took
a
nose
and
pow
intense
aromas
were
present
filled
with
strong
alcohol
berry
and
malty
tones
all
mixed
together
it
was
a
little
intimidating
to
sip
but
the
nose
provides
ample
warning
as
to
the
flavors
in
which
you
will
find
all
of
which
are
very
intense
it
was
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
blueberry
hidden
underneath
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
immense
with
very
light
carbonation
to
make
this
brew
smooth
and
easy
to
swallow
this
is
definitely
not
for
the
novice
beer
consumer
although
it
reminds
me
of
a
port
a
bit
at
14
5abv
its
not
something
to
mess
around
with
i
had
to
sip
on
this
guy
for
a
while
overall
it
lives
up
to
the
american
barleywine
standards
powerful
and
alcoholic
i
am
a
little
disappointed
however
in
the
weak
oak
flavor
i
got
it
was
one
of
the
selling
points
on
this
brew
and
i
was
pressed
to
pick
up
on
any
of
the
oak
flavors
mouthfeel
is
big
thick
and
dense
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
goes
down
smooth
without
too
much
alcohol
bite
drinkability
is
definetly
hindered
due
to
the
abv
and
the
sweetness
here
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
a
very
tasty
brew
just
needs
to
have
the
sweetness
dialed
down
imho
im
looking
forward
to
the
mephistopheles
in
my
cellar
as
i
sampled
it
at
the
ebf
and
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
damn
what
can
i
say
im
a
sucker
for
big
beers
and
this
one
hangs
with
the
best
of
them
im
reminded
a
lot
of
dfhs
raison
dextra
by
samael
except
obviously
with
more
oak
this
is
a
very
tasty
sipper
and
one
that
i
look
forward
to
both
cellaring
and
trying
again
the
body
is
rich
and
done
well
very
impressive
for
such
a
large
alcohol
and
this
easy
to
drink
a
velvety
taste
and
limited
esters
i
guess
i
am
a
sam
i
am
drinker
this
one
is
a
sipper
only
with
the
abv
evident
better
with
age
maybe
this
demons
of
ale
series
was
a
great
idea
though
id
love
to
see
more
stuff
like
this
from
avery
i
truly
wish
that
avery
would
release
this
beer
agian
i
think
it
could
have
used
another
year
or
4
in
the
cellar
but
it
is
incredible
right
now
quite
possibly
the
single
most
complex
beer
that
i
have
ever
drank
stunning
lots
of
cherries
and
a
handful
of
strawberries
soaked
for
a
week
in
brandy
then
sprinkled
with
chocolate
before
being
servered
yawzah
this
is
a
flavor
smack
upside
the
head
the
alcohol
screams
through
burning
a
path
behind
it
yet
its
also
a
sugary
sweet
beer
candy
and
cake
and
all
that
serve
cold
and
sip
slowly
with
respect
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
but
also
one
that
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
drinkability
is
solid
but
the
strength
of
this
brew
kind
of
eliminates
the
taste
buds
for
the
rest
of
the
night
worth
trying
but
be
warned
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
buy
it
almost
anytime
i
see
a
bottle
this
is
a
malt
lovers
brew
and
a
sipper
two
of
these
and
i
am
sure
i
would
be
all
set
for
the
nite
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
avery
and
the
best
i
have
sampled
in
a
while
overall
buy
it
if
you
see
it
and
send
me
a
few
liquid
desert
i
think
i
killed
my
sweettooth
for
the
month
mouthfeel
very
syrupy
yet
with
alittle
velvet
to
help
smooth
out
the
heat
from
this
high
abv
barley
wine
bottle
date
2005

abv
to
me
this
beer
is
not
very
drinkable
the
sticky
sweetness
and
high
alcohol
dont
make
for
a
very
enjoyable
combo
needs
some
hops
or
something
to
balance
it
out
interesting
but
not
to
my
taste
pours
clear
rich
cherry
amber
a
noticably
viscous
pour
that
forewarns
beyond
there
be
devils
samael
was
said
to
have
planted
the
vine
in
the
garden
of
eden
there
are
many
parallels
with
the
inviting
sweet
fruity
aroma
wine
like
with
french
oak
barrel
vanilla
aroma
maybe
a
little
cloying
at
start
but
not
thin
bodied
satisfying
fruity
finish
with
oak
and
9

no
fusels
abv
just
high
enough
to
leg
the

of
the

l
rastal
sniffer
trapped
vapors
bring
water
to
my
eyes
and
the
awesome
flavors
assult
the
mouth
and
nose
i
repour
and
watch
the
sweet
liquor
decappitate
its
head
with
a
single
swing
of
alcoholic
scythe
sometime
known
as
a
ley
used
for
cutting
oats
or
barley
and
symbolically
for
death
i
remember
the
dogfish
heads
old
school
barley
wine
and
find
this
is
more
drinkable
happy
to
share
this
one
with
friends
tempt
one
of
yours
with
this
unique
barleywines
from
avery
rich
cherry
color
soft
fruit
and
caramel
in
the
aroma
with
hints
of
apple
and
cherries
light
vanilla
light
toasted
oak
and
alcohol
exreme
flavor
but
in
a
respectful
and
succulant
manner
initially
cloying
and
thin
but
the
finish
is
absolutely
mindblowing
with
a
lingering
flavor
of
raisin
and
plump
red
fruit
really
rich
im
really
impressed
by
this
new
offering
from
avery
the
best
extreme
beer
ive
had
in
awhile
bottle
from
martys
in
newton
ma
served
at
chilled
basement
temperature
pours
a
dark
amber
red
color
with
curls
of

a

of

is
of

alcohol
the
first
sip
is
amazing
vanilla
sticky
sweet
alcohol
syrup
i
could
eat
this
on
or
in
pancakes
or
waffles
this
is
truly
a
strong
sweetened
barleywine
comparable
to
old
school
from
dfh
but
with
more
vanilla
flavor
and
more
body
the
price
tag
of
about
9bottle
makes
this
a
rare
treat
best
shared
respect
beer
smelled
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
honey
red
with
no
head
this
actually
has
a
pretty
good
flavor
if
you
take
real
small
sips
vanilla
and
fruit
pear
is
big
flavors
with
small
sips
big
sips
make
it
like
a
shot
of
bourbon
very
averylike
crazy
creation
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
id
like
to
see
some
roasted
malt
and
more
ibus
in
this
fallen
angel
to
balance
it
out
a
musttry
overall
impression
wow
intense
i
thought
it
was
like
sam
adams
triple
bock
but
then
i
opened
one
of
those
and
noted
the
differences
still
this
is
rich
flavorful
tasty
but
strong
its
not
playing
treat
with
respect
and
enjoy
recommended
thanks
to
pegasus
for
sharing
the
bottle
d
this
beer
is
everything
that
bourbon
wishes
it
could
be
sessionable
thats
a
stupid
question
one
of
these
and
im
very
drunk
already
but
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
this
12
oz
bottle
cost
me
6
on
sale
i
am
strongly
contemplating
buying
a
few
other
bottles
before
this
sale
ends
i
bet
this
would
store
extremely
well
i
think
this
is
my
new
favorite
barleywine
i
cant
believe
that
it
is
rated
so
low
compared
to
other
barleywines
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
fact
one
bottle
is
almost
too
much
overall
it
was
definitely
interesting
way
overboard
on
the
sweetness
which
i
normally
hate
but
this
was
surprisingly
not
that
bad
i
found
myself
freely
sipping
it
rather
than
forcing
it
down
which
i
normally
do
with
the
sweet
beers
you
must
drink
this
beer
an
alltime
top
10
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
very
thick
beer
to
drink
frankly
all
i
could
do
was
sip
the
beer
this
would
probably
be
an
alright
beer
to
split
several
ways
almost
to
much
for
one
beer
drinker
to
finish
the
body
is
thick
syrupy
and
very
puckery
not
very
good
disgustingly
sweet
and
vinegary
and
coats
to
the
mouth
pretty
much
everybody
i
sampled
this
beer
with
ended
up
pouring
out
most
of
it
and
i
sampled
it
with
two
independent
groups
of
people
drinkability
a
very
odd
beer
a
cool
bottle
but
maybe
not
balanced
at
all
which
in
this
case
makes
for
a
beer
that
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
reminds
me
of
sme
ginger
wine
i
had
a

back
still
i
am
glad
to
have
sampled
it

be
the
best

ive
had
and
ive
had

and
a

finish
very
nice

borderline
cloying
on
the
sweetness
but
never
quite
getting
too
much
for
how
high
octane
and
sweet
it
is
this
really
is
amazingly
drinkable
i
just
sipped
it
alone

it
would
also
go
great
with
some
cheese

even

i
always
let
my

who
arent

always
try
the

always
they
look
at
me
like
im
crazy
im
in

with
english

brews
as
in

stouts
and
barleywines
this
is
a
spot
on
english
style
barleywine
malt
foward
with
lots
of
fruit
i
was
surprised
by
this
brew
i
now
have
to
have
a
side

with
bourbon

i
feel
this

this
one
blew
me
away
and
is
an
absolute
must
try
seek
it
out
overall
a
very
very
good
example
of
a
ba
barleywine
i
really
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
to
put
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
that
booze
mellows
would
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
absolutely
fantastic
one
of
the
best
english
barleywines
that
ive
had
im
very
happy
to
have
procured
multiple
bottles
to
enjoy
again
both
soon
and
as
it
ages
this
is
one
of
an
elite
few
that
i
would
say
is
truly
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
very
nice
big
and
boozy
bourbon
beer
great
balance
between
barrel
and
non
barrel
characters
i
really
like
the
mapley
tastes
i
get
throughout
a
worthwhile
and
delicious
beer
absolutely
delicious
barrel
aged
barleywine
one
of
the
best
ive
had
o
one
of
the
top
5
barley
wines
i
have
tasted
highly
recommended
well
done
overall
a
fantastic
barrelaged
english
barleywine
can
stand
with
the
best
of
them
too
bad
places
price
gouge
this
quite
a
bit
ive
seen
bottles
for
30
less
than
what
i
paid
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
barleywine
great
i
dunno
i
will
definitely
try
this
fresh
and
see
the
difference
it
makes
for
me
the
beer
was
a
little
bland
which
could
have
been
from
the
age
the
aroma
is
the
best
thing
about
it
though
the
taste
left
me
a
little
let
down
given
the
love
for
this
brew
overall
arctic
devil
is
a
worldclass
barleywine
with
the
perfect
ammount
of
wood
to
round
it
out
the
booze
can
be
a
bit
rough
but
with
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
i
expect
great
things
medium
bodied
smooth
with
low
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
for
a
13
4
abv
beer
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
o
an
excellent
example
of
what
barrel
aging
can
do
to
an
english
style
to
me
not
supper
hoppy
barleywine
if
you
like
sucabaabacus
or
bourbon
angels
share
youll
like
this
one
of
the
best
example
of
the
style
a
nicely
complex
take
the
year
of
age
has
mellowed
it
and
made
it
a
worthy
investment
this
is
kind
of
like
a
night
in
a
bottle
the
only
reasonable
way
to
drink
this
is
to
sip
it
its
monstrous
but
its
worth
it
maybe
this
would
be
a
lot
better
in
like
5
years
wow
as
this
warms
it
really
starts
showing
its
chocolate
and
bourbon
character
where
colder
it
had
showed
more
fruit
but
and
dry
oak
on
the
warmer
side
the
flavor
is
comparable
to
something
like
a
ba
speedway
chocolate
and
bourbon
character
awesome
the
feel
is
downright
velvety
with
not
a
stitch
of
the
high
abv
to
be
felt
great
stuff
just
a
fantastic
ba
barleywine
aging
this
for
a
year
properly
really
did
a
trick
this
beer
is
pretty
unique
to
me
after
having
more
than
a
few
bourbon
barrel
barleywines
the
bourbon
flavor
is
unique
it
has
a
peppery
feel
but
only
mixes
and
does
not
dominate
the
flavor
the
english
yeast
only
makes
it
all
the
better
with
a
great
raisiny
dark
fruit
spiced
feel
holy
cow
how
have
i
never
heard
of
this
beer
mentioned
when
people
are
talking
about
the
best
of
the
best
in
barrel
barleywines
i
think
this
may
be
it
i
rated
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
a
perfect
5
and
go
through
at
least
a
case
of
it
a
year
but
this
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
holy
cow
i
am
truly
thankful
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
overall
the
most
enjoyable
things
about
this
brew
were
its
aroma
and
flavoring
it
is
extremely
hard
to
peg
a
top
component
for
this
beer
as
everything
about
it
sings
beautifully
and
strictly
to
style
all
while
satiating
and
appeasing
the
drinker
the
aroma
is
deep
rich
and
sweet
and
the
flavoring
follows
exactly
as
it
should
in
those
footprints
the
booze
is
heavy
but
subdued
and
neither
hot
nor
harsh
at
any
point
the
bourbon
is
glorious
oaky
and
musky
just
boasting
what
a
proper
barrel
aging
could
do
for
a
beer
the
feel
is
what
really
takes
this
beer
to
otherworldly
status
with
velvety
crush
silky
smoothness
and
buttery
slide
across
the
oropharynx
even
with
excessive
warmth
the
arctic
devil
remains
firm
to
its
promises
with
the
complexity
of
it
all
extending
this
tasting
beyond
two
hours
this
is
one
of
the
best
english
barleywines
weve
ever
come
across
and
again
while
that
is
partly
due
to
its
impeccable
execution
of
recipe
and
style
the
unique
heavily
warming
and
rich
alaskan
flair
makes
for
an
incredible
unforgettable
experience
that
will
not
soon
be
forgotten
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
aromas
of
dark
caramelized
sugar
dark
pitted
fruits
bits
of
wood
hints
of
rum
and
bourbon
light
alcohol
no
hop
aromas
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
dark
sugars
light
oak
light
fruits
a
solid
hit
of
warming
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
earth
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
moderate
to
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
sticky
mouthfeel
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wines
i
only
wish
it
were
a
little
easier
to
obtain
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
with
a
beige
head
aroma
is
of
filled
with
dark
fruits
oak
vanilla
bourbon
soaked
raisins
cherries
caramel
toffee
and
earthy
notes
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
nice
amounts
of
barrel
character
again
lots
of
oak
and
vanilla
bourbon
soaked
raisins
caramel
toffee
earthy
notes
cherries
and
nice
sweet
notes
the
body
is
full
with
a
silky
and
slightly
sticky
mouth
feel
overall
this
is
an
allaround
outstanding
beer
the
bourbon
comes
through
in
the
perfect
amount
for
me
and
the
other
flavors
all
of
which
are
delicious
blend
together
for
a
fantastic
profile
some
beers
with
a
similar
profile
to
this
are
overly
sweet
but
this
one
is
just
perfect
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
very
fortunate
to
have
tried
this
i
have
had
other
batches
of
arctic
devil
and
every
one
does
seem
just
a
bit
different
this
new
2012
batch
seems
to
have
lost
some
of
the
fruity
notes
from
years
past
but
in
their
place
there
is
an
overwhelming
blast
of
roasted
malts
and
sweet
bourbon
leading
to
a
semidry
finish
that
is
quite
a
bit
more
boozy
however
it
is
less
so
when
it
opens
up
probably
should
be
drank
near
5055
degrees
maybe
ms
has
ditched
some
of
their
port
and
cabernet
barrels
for
more
bourbon
because
thats
the
direction
that
this
vintage
is
headed
for
mouthfeel
on
the
beer
is
as
always
velvety
and
sublime
o
good
god
this
beer
is
incredible
probably
my
favorite
barleywine
bar
none
very
nice
barleywine
o
this
is
a
really
excellent
ba
beer
i
loves
the
soft
roast
in
the
start
and
the
smooth
and
sweet
feel
throughout
the
finish
is
pretty
darn
near
perfect
super
enjoyable
overall
great
stuff
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
tasted
for
sure
surprisingly
strong
with
the
molasses
smellflavour
but
it
works
overall
this
is
the
second
best
english
barleywine
that
i
have
had
with
first
one
being
a
retired
gem
and
probably
my
favorite
midnight
sun
beer
period
you
get
everything
you
will
need
when
asking
for
quality
as
far
as
availability
is
concerned
i
dont
think
you
will
find
a
better
barleywine
out
there
definitely
will
get
again
arctic
devil
is
aptly
named
after
the
wild
and
vivacious
wolverine
for
it
presents
a
snarling
but
sophisticated
blend
of
bold
flavors
in
a
naturalfeeling
harmony
this
is
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
a
brewery
which
has
a
lot
of
fantastic
beers
totally
wicked
thanks
beership
t
even
as
it
warms
the
oak
comes
through
a
lot
more
than
id
like
holding
back
the
other
flavors
in
here
brown
sugar
and
caramel
come
through
along
with
a
pretty
big
hit
of
booze
some
toffee
a
slight
hint
of
bourbon
and
some
more
buttery
oak
on
the
finish
definitely
way
too
oak
forward
for
me
right
now
but
i
cant
wait
to
revisit
this
in
a
year
or
so
o
rich
chewy
flavorful
leaves
you
wanting
more
bravo
o
amazing
english
barleywine
one
of
the
best
ive
had
not
overly
sweet
perfect
barrel
o
really
had
high
hopes
might
have
just
had
a
bad
bottle
or
one
that
might
have
been
a
little
too
old
will
hopefully
have
this
one
again
and
will
rereview
if
needed
o
oh
wow
this
is
great
recommended
without
reservation
d
fantastic
barrel
aged
barley
wine
great
overall
balance
overall
very
impressive
beer
from
midnight
sun
this
and
berserker
should
surely
be
on
your
wants
list
overalldrinkabilitythis
is
objectively
speaking
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
ever
had
truly
an
exceptional
beverage
o
so
glad
i
got
to
try
this
finally
very
solid
brew
from
midnight
sun
seek
it
out
diverse
great
aromatics
memorable
fantastic
skol
i
would
be
remiss
if
i
did
not
amend
this
review
having
had
a
bottle
of
the
2013
with
about
a
year
on
it
the
aging
on
this
beer
was
stellar
not
only
did
it
retain
a
lot
more
of
the
original
hoppiness
but
the
flavors
of
booze
barley
and
hop
melded
together
seamlessly
into
a
truly
superior
product
you
should
always
buy
a
bottle
of
this
when
it
comes
around
and
if
you
have
the
discipline
sit
on
a
bottle
or
two
to
enjoy
later
o
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
long
time
and
it
didnt
disappoint
a
great
complex
barelywine
where
eveything
lines
up
in
an
equal
order
barrel
sweetness
vanilla
chocolate
awesomeness
where
i
have
found
other
ba
barleywines
even
the
highest
rated
to
be
a
little
thin
or
lacking
in
complexity
this
one
nails
it
rich
chewy
great
i
will
be
buying
a
couple
fresh
ones
to
age
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
it
doesnt
quite
make
it
into
my
top
elitebw
tier
with
moas
sucaba
and
old
nuptial
but
its
not
far
behind
and
is
still
one
of
the
best
bws
ive
had
intoxicating
aroma
just
a
touch
too
bitter
on
the
tongue
i
wish
i
had
another
one
to
cellar
and
see
if
that
bitterness
fades
either
way
still
excellent
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
highly
recommend
oin
a
word
delicious
enjoying
a
scotch
or
bourbon
now
and
then
perhaps
this
beer
fits
my
particular
niche
but
i
would
presume
anyone
new
to
barleys
would
enjoy
this
outstanding
beer
another
winner
from
msb
finally
the
beer
ship
came
in
poured
in
to
a
snifter
glass
this
beer
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
very
minimal
head
the
nose
gives
deep
caramel
and
toffee
taste
is
caramel
toffee
with
some
chocolate
coffee
and
vanilla
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
this
some
slight
tobacco
notes
are
on
the
finish
very
smooth
with
some
slight
bourbon
notes
well
done
theres
definitely
a
good
deal
of
heat
but
this
only
adds
more
complexity
in
a
catalyst
sort
of
way
sucaba
was
my
favorite
barleywine
but
this
flavortexture
monster
eclipses
it
received
my
box
from
beership
of
6
of
these
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
poured
into
half
acre
snifter
appearance
is
really
dark
much
darker
than
most
barleywines
small
rim
of
tan
head
dissipates
quickly
nose
is
rich
and
full
of
layers
notes
of
caramel
molasses
chocolate
raisin
vanilla
leather
and
tobacco
taste
is
just
as
complex
as
the
nose
with
highlights
of
molasses
chocolate
and
raisins
the
bourbon
is
mellow
and
melds
nicely
with
everything
going
on
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
mild
carbonation
overall
incredibly
complex
barleywine
pours
a
dark
amber
body
with
fleeting
tan
head
leaving
a
sheet
of
the
same
caramel
vanilla
oak
bourbon
brandy
seafoam
hints
of
leather
and
sherry
oxidation
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
but
less
impressive
and
there
is
an
alcoholic
tinge
to
the
finish
thin
bodied
and
low
carb
the
booze
is
evident
on
this
one
and
leaves
a
burn
this
is
a
good
beer
but
my
favorite
was
the
08
sadly
i
didnt
review
back
then
but
i
recall
a
fuller
body
and
more
refined
character
in
the
beer
as
it
stands
i
would
advise
trying
this
beer
but
not
really
seeking
it
out
particularly
hard
unless
youre
chadquest
or
other
peeps
that
really
dig
the
ba
bws
o
glad
i
got
a
few
extras
to
age
although
its
ready
now
to
drink
this
beer
is
highly
recommended
big
thanks
again
to
ed
for
opening
this
one
it
was
damn
delicious
i
have
no
other
arctic
devils
to
compare
it
to
but
holy
shit
this
was
superdrinkable
for
a
13
2
barleywine
very
sweet
and
woody
all
around
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
atmosphere
is
really
solid
decent
head
nice
effervescence
and
some
slight
lacing
nose
is
excellent
combination
of
sweet
components
flavor
is
lightly
pungent
and
lightly
sweet
nutty
and
syrupy
characterized
by
caramel
milk
chocolate
and
maple
but
heavily
sweet
well
done
high
alcohol
content
is
well
disguised
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
this
beer
had
more
of
a
bitter
note
to
it
than
many
of
the
other
beers
opened
that
night
there
is
a
strong
sweet
presence
to
balance
things
out
but
i
would
have
liked
the
bitterness
to
be
a
bit
milder
im
getting
some
booze
but
its
still
quite
smooth
there
is
a
nice
caramel
note
in
the
background
the
body
is
thick
with
smooth
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
from
notes
12910
bottle
2010
version
among
the
very
best
barleywines
that
ive
tried
this
is
sitdownandtakeamoment
good
and
i
can
imagine
it
getting
better
with
age
the
pour
is
clear
ruby
with
a
tiny
head
its
fairly
viscous
though
not
quite
as
much
as
you
might
expect
from
a
14
abv
beer
all
sorts
of
flavors
come
out
in
the
aroma
and
taste
theres
an
enormous
english
carameltoffee
malt
flavor
marbled
with
a
ton
of
fruitiness
lots
of
raisins
plums
peaches
dates
and
cherries
on
top
of
that
there
are
great
flavors
of
vanilla
mint
oak
leather
and
subtle
barrel
notes
theres
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
pull
it
back
from
cloying
territory
this
is
a
deeply
flavored
beer
that
oozes
luxury
and
craftsmanship
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
it
coats
the
mouth
pleasantly
but
ive
had
lots
of
stickier
boozier
beers
that
arent
nearly
the
size
of
this
one
midnight
sun
knows
their
stuff
and
really
hit
one
out
of
the
park
with
this
beer
i
might
be
scoring
this
a
bit
low
in
anticipation
of
trying
an
aged
bottle
in
a
few
years
o
one
of
the
best
barleywines
out
there
strong
execution
all
around
and
highly
recommended
so
smooth
and
complex
i
kept
going
back
for
more
and
more
pours
even
though
its
a
bad
idea
at
13
abv
taste
is
molasses
fresh
maple
syrup
alcohol
and
caramel
soooo
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
malts
are
rich
and
have
a
perfect
flow
to
them
mouthfeel
is
rich
but
not
overly
thick
or
cloying
wonderful
beer
classic
even
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
in
some
time
o
overall
this
was
a
good
barleywine
not
great
just
good
slightly
disappointed
here
for
the
trouble
it
is
to
get
anchorage
brews
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
one
there
are
readily
available
barleywines
on
the
market
i
can
get
at
a
fraction
wow
four
years
still
hasnt
tamed
this
critter
much
i
knew
from
previous
experience
that
this
was
an
aggressive
bw
and
being
partial
to
aged
english
barleywines
figured
with
some
time
to
cool
off
this
would
be
primo
stuff
apparently
i
need
to
give
the
other
ones
more
time
certainly
a
quality
beer
as
always
with
midnight
sun
but
a
bit
of
a
thrash
metal
mosh
pit
in
the
mouth
drink
i
enjoyed
this
i
got
a
new
job
yesterday
and
opened
something
nice
i
was
hoping
this
was
some
sort
of
a
kh
killer
that
i
finally
had
my
hands
on
it
wasnt
not
to
say
it
wasnt
a
good
beer
just
expected
more
its
good
but
not
great
i
think
i
prefer
abacus
to
this
overall
a
decadent
bourbony
malt
bomb
a
great
sipper
of
a
beer
4
0
d
its
a
good
beer
that
just
has
one
fatal
flaw
great
flavors
but
i
need
more
maltiness
when
im
drinking
a
barleywine
ill
have
to
try
this
fresh
sometime
a
very
nice
barrelaged
barleywine
that
falls
perhaps
a
hair
short
of
the
best
in
class
wish
i
had
been
able
to
try
past
vintages
also
wish
i
had
more
than
the
single
bottle
to
so
i
could
sock
a
few
away
for
aging
a
bourbon
barrel
barleywine
sipper
that
i
had
a
hard
time
sipping
id
put
my
money
on
this
against
any
barleywine
no
matter
the
whale
status
o
good
ba
barleywine
but
nothing
outstanding
if
you
get
a
chance
definitely
worth
a
try
but
dont
trade
your
first
born
for
it
vey
good
was
expecting
more
given
its
reputation
overall
well
balanced
english
barleywine
and
barrel
notes
i
dont
know
if
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
more
than
i
should
have
but
its
a
small
let
down
even
as
its
at
the
bottom
of
the
top
tier
of
its
style
what
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
it
is
a
bold
boozy
sipper
that
is
quite
enjoyable
i
am
very
appreciative
to
have
the
chance
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
significantly
sized
pour
of
this
aged
beauty
however
just
like
my
initial
thoughts
of
this
brew
when
i
had
a
small
sampling
some
time
ago
it
lacks
just
a
bit
in
body
i
found
the
aromatics
to
be
much
more
complex
than
the
flavor
as
well
thanks
again
heath
overall
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
still
think
abacus
is
my
favorite
english
bwine
but
this
is
not
far
behind
o
the
whiskey
barrel
was
nicely
integrated
and
a
liked
the
sweetness
it
entailed
very
happy
to
have
tried
this
guy
overall
excellent
flavors
the
oxidation
is
nice
the
only
downfall
is
the
mouthfeel
too
thin
in
the
finish
very
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
gem
thanks
so
much
matt
a
delicious
fruity
liquerlike
barleywine
not
quite
the
best
ive
had
that
title
remains
with
abacus
but
definitely
up
there
i
will
most
definitely
seek
this
out
again
o
tasting
this
sidebyside
with
king
henry
and
moas
didnt
do
this
one
justice
at
all
that
said
it
is
yet
another
solid
beer
from
midnight
sun
on
the
fuller
end
of
mediumbodied
with
a
well
integrated
barrel
character
that
doesnt
overpower
the
elements
of
the
base
beer
some
nice
dry
oak
along
with
spicysweet
whiskey
vanilla
and
coconut
soft
carbonation
adds
to
the
palate
and
the
sweet
and
leathery
notes
from
the
base
beer
really
come
through
hints
of
toffee
dark
fruit
caramel
and
leathery
malts
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
subtle
warmth
in
finish
but
overall
the
abv
is
very
well
masked
lots
of
boozy
flavor
but
not
a
lot
of
heat
cant
believe
that
its
13
5
really
nice
a
bit
heavy
on
the
barrelwhiskey
presence
but
the
characteristics
of
the
base
beer
come
through
nicely
review
from

notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
deep
red
amber
minimal
offwhite
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
whiskey
malt
and
fruit
starts
with
malt
whiskey
and
caramel
finishing
with
dark
fruits
a
touch
of
oak
more
whiskey
and
alcohol
very
complex
and
rich
nice
heavy
body
would
score
higher
without
the
big
alcohol
punch
hopefully
this
will
mellow
with
age
excellent
barley
wine
overall
a
solid
beer
thats
easy
enough
to
drink
but
somewhat
lack
luster
compared
to
others
in
the
style
the
base
beer
is
a
little
mild
and
the
barrel
aging
a
little
too
restrained
perhaps
something
worth
checking
out
if
you
see
it
but
nothing
earth
shattering
enough
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
id
have
it
again
but
would
most
likely
pick
something
else
first
thanks
again
for
the
trade
stupac
much
appreciated
i
would
rank
this
the
second
best
barley
wine
ive
had
only
behind
alpine
great
very
good
overall
not
quite
the
epic
level
of
some
others
in
the
category
fantastic
o
amazing
beer
so
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
taste
this
and
remember
it
o
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
at
the
tasting
behind
king
henry
of
course
would
love
to
grab
a
few
more
of
these
to
set
down
for
a
bit
very
impressed
o
hmm
i
found
this
got
much
better
as
i
let
it
warm
a
sipper
for
sure
and
the
high
abv
really
shows
ive
never
given
that
a
ton
of
credence
also
poured
from
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
darker
red
copper
color
along
with
another
disappearing
head
though
the
lacing
was
stuck
on
throughout
same
aromatics
and
flavors
as
the
2008
vintage
but
more
enhanced
probably
due
to
the
freshness
of
the
brew
improved
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
a
much
better
vintage
seems
as
if
the
fresher
it
is
the
better
id
probably
not
cellar
this
one
any
more
than
a
couple
years
if
i
had
multiple
bottles
o
im
trying
to
be
critical
about
this
because
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
after
fighting
with
it
over
30
minutes
ill
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
had
deserves
more
than
a
4
0
but
there
is
no
4
25
overall
option
the
real
thing
holding
it
down
in
the
overall
is
the
heat
i
think
another
year
in
the
bottle
will
bring
this
thing
to
another
level
now
i
need
to
find
another
one
o
sweet
and
carmel
and
toffee
that
try
and
hide
the
beast
of
an
abv
a
bit
hot
but
great
overall
great
barleywine
pours
a
dark
cloudy
amber
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
is
a
decadent
blend
of
roast
oak
bourbon
vanilla
plum
raisin
brown
sugar
caramel
and
cherry
extremely
creamy
and
smooth
body
with
a
rich
flavor
similar
to
the
nose
maple
cherry
raisin
plum
vanilla
bourbon
and
oak
dominate
the
flavor
an
all
around
smooth
well
balanced
and
complex
barleywine
d
overall
i
really
enjoy
the
freshness
and
mix
of
barrels
it
creates
this
multiplicity
across
the
nose
and
palate
that
is
really
unique
for
the
style
midnight
suns
grasp
on
this
blend
is
pretty
excellent
a
great
beer
at
this
age
and
one
that
you
can
tell
will
get
even
better
with
age
this
was
nice
and
aged
very
well
with
that
oxidation
that
was
present
mostly
complimenting
the
other
flavors
and
only
got
to
be
mildly
distracting
in
spots
this
was
very
rich
and
smooth
overall
though
and
i
was
glad
that
i
finally
found
a
proper
time
to
open
this
guy
now
i
just
need
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
to
compare
o
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
for
sure
a
good
balance
of
everything
and
pretty
complex
as
well
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
with
a
thin

nice

a
nice

with
a
little
bit
of
booze
in
the
background
flavor
is
a
nicely
balanced
mix
of
toffee
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
with
some
oak
in
there
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
its
not
nearly
as
good
as
some
of
the
past
vintages
ive
had
maybe
this
beer
needs
some
age
to
be
truly
great
o
this
is
the
best
barley
wine
ive
tried
fantastic
half

uneven

not
overly
sweet
some

taste
is
a
wee

on
the
sweet
side
but
not
overly
so
light
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
full
side
of
medium
good
effervescence
this
brew
packs
a
powerful
punch
splitting
a
bottle
multiple
ways
is
highly
recommended
a
very
good
example
of
english
style
barleywine
maltforward
and
very
tasty
o
i
wanted
to
love
this
beer
but
i
think
it
needs
some
age
its
big
and
malty
but
it
hasnt
quite
acquired
that
sweet
ripe
fruit
flavor
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
style
good
not
great
arctic

pours
a
fairly
clear
polished
mahogany
theres
about
two
fingers
of
khaki
colored
foam
capping
the
beer
head
retention
is
solid
but
lacing
is
fairly
spotty
the
nose
is
just
a
series
of
wonderful
aromas
washing
over
me
one
after
the
next
port
inspired
dark
fruits
coconut
vanilla
caramel
and
nutty
sherrylike
aromas
all
take
a
turn
in
the
spotlight
not
to
mention
a
slight
smell
of
alcohol
after
all
that
the
flavor
profile
has
a
hard
time
living
up
darl
fruits
and
a
nutty
sweetness
are
the
dominant
flavors
with
vanilla
and
caramel
showing
up
as
well
a
lid
more
presence
from
the
base
barleywine
would
be
great
because
whats
in
my
glass
is
tasty
but
i
think
i
could
come
up
with
something
similar
just
by
blending
some
port
and
sherry
to
taste
the
slight
alcohol
warmth
creeps
in
pleasantly
for
the
finish
of
each
sip
the
body
is
pleasantly
rich
and
full
though
not
as
heavy
as
i
might
have
expected
from
a
13
beer
the
carbonation
is
wonderfully
understated
doing
its
job
while
staying
out
of
the
way
of
the
malt
and
barrel
flavors
arctic
devil
is
a
great
brew
to
have
in
your
glass
for
a
couple
hours
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
clearly
dominated
by
the
barrel
aging
o
a
great
barleywine
it
kinda
sucks
that
it
followed
king
henry
but
this
guy
fought
really
hard
to
stand
amongst
the
top
of
the
crop
great
stuff
nice
woody
vanilla
makes
this

favorite
ba
barleywines
really
solid
beer
from
midnight
sun
brewing
i
recommend
drinking
this
slightly
higher
than
room
temperature
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
english
style
barleywines
ive
had
a
perfect
balance
of
malt
accentuated
beer
with
enough
supporting
hops
to
keep
it
from
cloying
and
also
with
some
interesting
fruitiness
that
adds
more
dimensions
and
complexity
rating
97100
a
well
done
english
barleywine
definitely
one
of
the
toptier
in
the
example
though
i
felt
the
booziness
became
just
a
bit
harsh
at
times
o
this
is
a
barleywine
thats
still
incredibly
young
this
certainly
needs
23
years
to
dry
out
and
possibly
become
really
good
right
now
its
just
adequate
easy
recommendation
650
ml
bottle
2011
vintage
pours
a
golden
copper
with
a
small
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
big
coconut
some
brandy

red

bourbon
vanilla

caramel
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
coconut

there
is
also
brandy
oak
bourbon

toffee
the
finish
has
some
light
alcohol
full
bodied
but
not
syrupy
low
carbonation
great
beer
lots
of
flavors
going
on
and
everything
comes
together
quite
nicely
overall
for
a
bw
and
especially
bbbw
lover
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
bought
two
cases
for
a
reason
and
havent
traded
a
single
one
just
the
right
mix
of
bourbon
oak
barrel
and
traditional
barley
wine
drinkable
as
all
hell
for
the
abv
and
just
the
right
sweetness
would
recommend
this
to
any
bbbw
lover
o
a
huge
and
complex
barleywine
for
sure
i
taste
and
smell
something
different
every
time
the
only
thing
that
really
detracts
is
that
the
bourbon
tastes
kinda
cheap
and
the
appearance
is
weak
not
that
that
counts
for
much
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
settles
to

of
the
beer

form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of

dark
fruits
and
wood
aromas
taste
is
the
same
but
there
is
a
more
noticeable
wood
and
whisky
presence
in
the
flavor
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
good
crispness
and
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
with
some
awesome

and
flavors
light

almost
medium

good

lingers
throughout
the

too
cheap
uck
o
i
dont
feel
that
age
has
helped
midnight
suns
arctic
devil
as
i
cant
imagine
this
is
what
the
brewer
intended
if
it
is
then
i
must
question
the
hype
as
this
is
about
as
middle
of
the
road
a
barleywine
as
ive
ever
come
across
this
clearly
does
not
drink
like
13
4
but
there
is
an
ethyl
alcohol
presence
that
is
a
bit
unappealing
at
this
point
some
age
might
improve
this
the
light
mouthfeel
will
most
likely
not
change
overall
bourbon
soda
and
i
use
that
term
in
a
most
positive
tone
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
and
one
that
i
could
not
even
taste
the
alcohol
despite
it
being
13abv
glad
i
have
another
to
lay
down
this
is
a
great
barley
wine
definitely
worth
the
price
this
is
right
up
their
with
king
henry
excellent
o
slow
sipper
glad
i
shared
this
as
would
struggle
on
a
whole
bottle
of
this
can
not
think
of
a
barleywine
that
comes
close
to
this
in
the
complexity
and
depth
that
this
had
first
beer
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
that
afterwards
i
just
have
an
instant
longing
to
have
again
unreal
d
i
try
not
to
use
superlatives
for
effect
so
im
being
sincere
when
i
say
this
is
among
the
best
english
barleywines
ive
ever
had
id
drink
it
again
anytime

batch
not
amongst
the
best
demoted
this
year
due
to
thinner
mouthfeel
cardboard
smell
on
nose
and
less
flavor
than
i
recall
i
am
a
bit
bothered
that
its
more
expensive
than
last
year
what
the
heck
price
tag
is
pushing
really
crisp
and
quit
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
creamy

rich
o

more

i
was

o
obviously
this
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
hype
behind
it
and
plenty
of
good
ratings
with
it
but
ive
also
heard
several
rather
negative
experiences
with
this
too
came
into
this
with
high
hopes
but
prepared
to
be
disappointed
although
not
the
perfect
barleywine
for
me
this
trended
towards
meeting
the
hype
really
well
balanced
with
sugars
and
alcohol
in
control
without
being
disguised
to
the
point
that
one
could
down
this
quickly
with
unexpected
results
for
me
the
highlight
of
this
beer
is
the
well
placed
and
lingering
creme
brulee
effect
i
can
almost
imagine
the
crunch
and
crackle
of
the
burnt
sugar
coating
on
top
of
the
dessert
really
really
nice
effect
this
absolutely
makes
this
beer
for
me
the
overall
balance
and
complexity
are
just
bonuses
quite
like
a
dessert
in
a
glass
for
me
overall
one
of
the
better
barley
wines
out
there
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
and
again
and
again
if
i
was
given
the
option
o
the
aroma
on
this
was
extremely
nice
the
taste
was
not
bad
but
definitely
needs
some
time
this
is
extremely
boozy
and
the
flavors
dont
quite
meld
together
im
going
to
let
the
rest
of
the
bottles
sit
for
a
while
overall
great
stuff
this
is
always
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
will
i
enjoy
this
glass
hell
yeah
overall
probably
an
excellent
barleywine
that
is
merely
very
very
good
right
now
o
good
beer
drank
a
little
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
have
liked
but
probably
to
be
expected
from
an
english
barleywine
with
some
age
on
it
would
love
to
try
some
other
vintages
extremely
impressive
extraordinary
beer
glad
i
tried
it
again
many
years
ago
i
found
it
too
sweet
and
boozy
but
i
was
also
drinking
beer
too
cold
then
i
had
the
wisdom
to
hang
on
to
one
for
a
while
and
now
i
regret
not
putting
away
a
few
every
year
when
i
had
the
chance
o
a
excellent
english
barleywine
the
combo
of
booze
and
sweetness
is
really
welldone
and
i
really
dont
have
much
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
try
it
o
have
had
a
few
times
and
this
is
the
worst
vintage
ive
had
that
being
said
it
is
still
an
amazing
brew
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
hot
but
otherwise
this
is
incredible
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
big
flavors
and
definitely
boozy
but
i
wouldnt
have
pegged
it
at
13
percent
solid
barleywine
weird
overall
outstanding
id
be
happy
to
revisit
to
see
if
i
bought
a
off
bottle
but
i
wont
be
purchasing
another
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
barrel
aged
barleywine
i
personally
would
have
liked
a
little
more
bourbon
in
the
nose
but
the
taste
was
amazing
and
i
loved
the
toffeecaramel
that
came
through
super
smooth
body
would
love
to
try
this
again
sometime
i
cannot
remember
who
sent
it
to
me
as
i
kept
this
one
in
the
cellar
for
quite
some
time
thanks
to
whomever
overall
nice
beer
bit
to
sharp
and
unbalanced
though
dark
brown
with
a
faint
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
fruity
caramel
considering
this
beer
is
over
14
abv
it
does
not
have
an
alcoholdominated
taste
delicious
but
not
overpowering
flavor
imparted
from
the
oak
aftertaste
lingers
for
quite
some
time
making
this
one
a
sipper
more
dark
fruit
comes
out
as
i
sample
longer
with
figs
and
plums
a
pretty
solid
beer
that
i
enjoy
a
lot
but
the
nose
seemed
to
promise
a
little
more
than
the
flavor
delivered
really
nice
offering
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
profile
really
makes
this
beer
shine
its
got
the
right
amount
of
big
sticky
malt
flavor
and
the
right
amount
of
hops
i
actually
would
classify
this
as
an
american
barleywine
plenty
of
hops
but
not
overbearing
lots
of
sugary
sticky
goodness
id
say
this
guy
is
too
hoppy
to
be
an
english
style
bw
and
far
too
sweet
to
be
a
dipa
overall
i
have
had
two
of
the
best
barleywines
in
my
life
backtoback
nights
last
night
was
mirror
mirror
2009
uninfected
version
but
i
think
no
i
know
this
tops
it
wow
so
so
so
highly
recommended
and
worth
trading
for
from
a
2010
vintage
pours
into
a
snifter
a
clear
dark
brown
with
some
red
and
larger
than
expected
bubbles
aroma
is
some
sweet
bourbon
plums
a
light
bitter
hop
flavor
is
sweet
plums
and
raisins
a
nice
hot
bourbon
in
the
finish
not
too
big
a
touch
of
a
hop
throughout
thats
just
out
of
place
enjoyed
this
less
than
some
of
the
older
years
but
still
pretty
good
o
a
monster
of
a
beer
arctic
devil
is
a
meal
in
a
glass
incredibly
robust
and
complex
with
a
ton
of
subtle
flavors
however
what
keeps
it
from
the
top
tiers
is
the
huge
body
and
alcohol
bite
towards
the
middle
and
end
age
would
probably
do
wonders
to
this
one
definitely
worth
trying
and
older
vintages
are
likely
worth
their
weight
in
gold
complex
on
the
level
of
hotd
adam
mouthfeel
of
a
big
ccb
beer
and
as
satisfying
as
rochefort
10
overall
as
soon
as
i
tasted
this
one
i
forgot
all
about
the
alcoholic
nose
what
an
amazing
barleywine
seek
this
one
out
high
fives
all
around
for
how
tremendous
this
beer
was
and
a
huge
thanks
to
nates
generosity
this
pours
a
nice
sunset
amber
body
with
an
off
white
foam
the
aroma
was
unbelievable
there
was
figs
raisins
caramel
vanilla
and
i
believe
i
detected
a
hint
of
orange
zest
as
well
the
taste
made
me
almost
cream
my
pants
this
is
on
par
with
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
the
flavors
included
hints
of
much
of
the
same
as
in
the
nose
only
with
the
perfect
level
of
sweetness
its
still
got
some
bite
to
it
on
the
tongue
but
by
most
estimates
the
mouthfeel
is
really
rather
splendid
i
wish
i
could
have
this
everyday
bathe
in
it
make
love
to
it
it
was
an
outstanding
beer
must
have
more
o
a
spectacular
malty
barleywine
with
a
smooth
barrel
complexity
and
mildly
warming
finish
with
some
are
theres
almost
no
alcohol
to
this
one
fantastic
now
that
i
think
about
it
though
im
pretty
sure
i
gave
that
high
five
away
before
this
was
cracked
meh
worth
it
regardless
it
the
beer
o
course
pours
a
cloudy
sunset
russetamber
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dark
sandy
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
vanilla
toffee
mild
maple
syrup
and
butterscotch
the
taste
holds
notes
of
toffee
chocolate
oak
vanilla
light
orange
peel
light
mandarin
orange
syrup
and
butterscotch
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
very
tasty
bwine
one
that
a
few
years
seems
to
have
done
wonders
for
so
this
bottle
was
an
08
and
everything
had
melded
so
well
it
was
unreal
there
was
little
alcohol
heat
but
some
deep
bourbon
flavors
are
still
there
caramel
and
toffee
had
overtaken
all
others
and
created
a
slightly
chewy
palate
coating
monster
of
a
bw
there
was
a
resin
hop
note
that
is
all
flavor
and
no
bitter
and
a
mammoth
butterscotch
richness
this
one
is
an
awesome
barleywine
i
will
need
to
track
down
a
bottle
gfunk
o
this
is
an
incredible
beer
even
while
so
young
the
depth
of
flavours
and
variance
leaves
you
wondering
how
that
is
even
possible
due
to
its
youth
it
is
still
a
touch
hot
but
in
a
year
or
two
this
beer
will
be
even
more
mindblowing
sure
glad
i
have
more
d
i
have
a
feeling
im
catching
the
arctic
devil
in
its
adolescence
he
has
shaking
off
some
of
the
youthful
edge
of
barrelaging
but
has
yet
to
mellow
into
a
proper
english
barleywine
a
fascinating
sipping
beer
o
this
was
a
beer
that
totally
lived
up
to
the
hype
i
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
myself
maybe
i
will
one
of
these
days
overall
this
is
a
great
barleywine
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
however
the
huge
abv
is
very
noticeable
and
it
clearly
hinders
this
beers
drinkability
o
overall
an
amazing
barleywine
that
id
love
to
have
again
d
a
fantastic
barleywine
sweet
and
rich
but
so
smooth
for
how
boozy
this
is
supposed
to
be
but
is
the
opposite
being
around
3
years
old
this
has
even
more
life
left
in
it
for
the
future
just
amazing
stuff
that
is
drinking
very
well
currently
overall
i
was
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
something
i
normally
cant
say
about
aged
barleywines
an
amazing
beer
that
is
very
much
worth
a
shot
also
worth
setting
one
down
for
a
few
years
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
multiples
as
a
quick
note
that
was
tasted
sidebyside
with
mother
of
all
storms
and
came
out
on
top
both
fantastic
beers
but
it
really
wasnt
even
a
competition
to
decide
my
favorite
2010
version
pours
orange
whit
head
smells
of
apples
green
granny
smith
kind
tastes
the
same
with
some
caramel
like
what
is
found
in
cracker
jack
medium
high
mouth
feel
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
very
enjoyable
barley
wine
i
cant
believe
i
havent
had
it
before
d
just
a
damn
stunning
barleywine
i
find
it
really
hard
to
give
a
perfect
5
to
any
strong
beer
in
this
category
but
this
one
is
sooo
very
close
ive
enjoyed
it
much
fresher
a
year
or
less
since
bottling
but
with
34
years
of
age
arctic
devil
absolutely
glows
as
of
now
perhaps
my
favorite
of
the
style
cheers
a
slight
syrup
tinge
though
surprisingly
dry
as
we
carouse
in
our
delectable
fantasy
now
made
real
and
i
wish
that
every
moment
we
could
be
even
as
we
are
in
a
seductive
tumble
of
flesh
a
delectable
monstrosity
of
flavours
and
colours
that
overwhelm
our
senses
and
recall
to
our
minds
through
our
flesh
from
our
hearts
once
again
i
love
you
its
true
pours
a
dark
golden
brown
with
a
limited
tan
head
smells
of
hops
and
malts
someone
said
freshly
threshed
grain
i
dunno
about
that
but
i
was
pretty
malleable
at
this
point
faded
hops
and
caramel
blend
fantastically
this
beer
is
delicious
and
deserves
to
be
aged
for
this
time
period
best
barleywine
i
have
had
other
than
gratitude
oddly
enough
this
tastes
more
like
an
american
barleywine
and
gratitude
more
like
an
english
barleywine
and
yet
their
designations
are
reversed
on
the
site
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
was
consumed
after
a
fresh
mother
of
all
storms
which
could
not
compete
though
it
might
be
unfair
to
compare
a
fresh
barrelaged
barleywine
to
a
two
year
aged
one
the
faded
hop
bitterness
limits
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
not
a
ton
otherwise
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
bottom
line
im
not
very
experienced
with
barleywines
but
im
not
crazy
about
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
less
syrupy
and
have
the
alcohol
more
present
instead
guaranteed
to
get
you
laid
100
of
the
time
every
time
and
thats
what
ill
continue
to
cherish
the
most
d
this
is
a
great
albeit
unique
barleywine
full
bodied
tasty
and
smoky
i
could
easily
finish
this
bomber
by
myself
the
warmth
from
the
alcohol
and
its
overall
intense
flavors
make
this
one
a
bit
of
a
sipper
for
me
but
i
would
try
it
again
anytime
this
beer
pours
a
very
opaque
chocolaty
brown
color
with
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
that
of
tootsie
rolls
honey
hops
and
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
a
hint
of
chocolate
on
the
front
the
oak
from
the
barrels
is
quite
present
a
surprisingly
smooth
finish
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
444
75
dhard
to
get
ahold
of
but
worth
the
trouble
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
cellar
it
wasnt
quite
ready
overall
like
this
good
beer
without
the
dirtiness
this
one
would
rise
to
a
whole
nuther
level
for
me
so
close
thanks
auroracrisis
d
this
definitely
drinks
smoother
than
the
listing
on
the
label
advertises
while
it
is
a
great
barleywine
i
believe
i
would
prefer
cwbbbw
and
tpsmoas
over
this
now
im
interested
in
how
this
would
be
fresh
ideas
form
fellow
tasters
di
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
could
iso
more
arctic
devil
please
overall
a
solid
beer
from
midnight
sun
i
dont
get
to
try
many
of
their
beers
but
this
one
is
right
down
my
alley
this
is
a
good
beer
i
can
think
of
a
number
of
english
barleywines
that
are
better
though
perhaps
if
i
set
it
aside
for
a
few
years
the
astringency
would
dissipate
worth
a
shot
when
considering
english
barleywines
if
you
divided
the
relatively
low
alcohol
ones
i
e
anchor
old
fofhorn
defining
the
style
and
the
high
alcohol
ones
arctic
devil
establishing
the
bar
this
barleywine
acrtic
devil
by
midnigth
sun
is
the
premier
high
alcohol
english
style
barleywine
in
my
humble
opinion
wow
smooth
and
13
abv
dont
normally
exist
in
the
same
sentence
but
this
wonderous
brew
manages
to
pull
it
off
the
full
maltraisenfig
complex
is
present
as
is
the
warmth
but
the
bite
is
nowhere
to
be
found
well
maybe
at
the
very
back
of
the
taste
perameters
a
great
brew
d
awesome
highly
drinkable
best
barleywine
ive
had
to
date
d
one
of
those
beers
that
u
open
when
u
want
to
really
take
your
time
drinking
it
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
for
about
an
hour
i
was
really
impressed
at
the
complexity
of
it
the
flavors
really
transform
as
the
beer
warms
a
heavenly
experience
i
have
one
more
left
that
i
will
be
putting
a
little
time
on
i
would
highly
suggest
u
seek
this
out
overrated
thanks
again
for
this
one
alex
d
amazingly
drinkable
just
so
smooth
i
really
loved
this
beer
deserves
to
be
in
the
top

poured
a
brown

no

nose
was
of
toffee
caramel
dark
fruits
and
light
tobacco
taste
was
the
same
as
the
nose
w
a
great
bitter
hop
backbone
that
balances
out
the
brew
nicely
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
the
tobacco
and
flavors
really
hung
on
the
palate
drinkability
was
my
only
drawback
on
this
brew
as
the
booziness
really
started
to
get
to
me
before
i
was
finished
w
my
snifter
if
the
abv
was
kicked
down
a
notch
or
two
i
would
have
rated
this
brew
as
world
class
overall
great
flavors
and
aromas
but
pretty
disappointed
at
how
hot
it
was
at
even
two
years
of
age
d
easily
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
d
not
one
i
would
drink
too
often
or
in
great
quantity
but
still
a
very
very
good
english
barleywine
the
abv
never
feels
as
big
as
it
is
which
makes
this
a
dangerous
one
for
sure
medium
body
some
carbonation
in
the
mouth
really
sweet
up
front
lots
of
flavor
some
liquor
like
components
raisins
plums
sweetness
lots
of
fruit
finishes
a
little
dry
its
a
big
beer
and
im
doing
my
best
to
slay
it
but
at
22
ounces
and
13
2
its
an
uphill
battle
it
is
quite
heavy
but
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
the
fruitiness
of
the
body
makes
this
a
great
drinking
beer
but
it
is
better
split
two
ways
good
barleywine
though
probably
improve
after
2
or
3
years
edit
ticked
the
07
vintage
from
the
bottle
well
poured
into
a
glass
recently
unbelievable
great
bal
character
and
just
so
much
going
on
nearly
the
perfect
bal
aged
barleywine
just
amazing
dthis
is
a
big
beer
lots
of
flavors
barrel
flavors
are
present
but
overpowered
by
a
lot
of
malty
sweetness
still
the
flavors
work
well
side
note

im
drinking
says
10
abv
but
is

definitely
tastes
like

higher
side
but
cant
really
say
for
sure
2008

smooth
texture
and
flat
carbonation
moderate
to
heavy
complex
sweet
flavor
with
a
medium
to
heavy
sweet
finish
of
moderate
to
long
duration
this
is
another
standout
beer
overall
very
nice
improving
nicely
as
it
warms
overall
a
super
tasty
barlyewine
but
im
glad
i
shared
it
with
some
people
because
i
dont
know
if
i
could
finish
the
whole
thing
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
mild
carbonation
and
drinkable
but
would
prefer
to
drink
only
12
oz
of
this
at
a
time
due
to
the
high
booze
percentage
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
brew
interesting
for
an
english
barleywine
compared
to
other
beers
ive
tried
in
this
style
not
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
but
still
a
great
brew
to
try
for
the
very
unique
flavors
blended
worth
hunting
down
for
sure
and
glad
i
did
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
2008
vintage
into
a
snifter
it
is
a
murky
caramel
color
with
a
very
slight
tan
head
slight
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
vanilla
oak
and
a
balanced
amount
of
whiskey
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
some
dark
fruit
notes
added
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
whiskey
notes
add
a
fullness
to
the
flavor
without
being
overpowering
the
finish
has
a
caramelwhiskey
sweetness
to
it
artic
devil
has
a
very
full
body
and
a
sticky
mouthfeel
very
low
carbonation
with
an
abv
of
13
it
is
a
nice
sipper
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
received
from
dunt
in
a
recent
bif
oh
we
are
fancy
men
indeed
to
celebrate
a
successfully
brewed
monstrous
stout
a
bit
early
it
was
time
to
ride
the
snake
we
were
quickly
enveloped
in
a
fire
of
vanilla
toffee
and
caramel
slight
whiskey
kick
little
bit
of
fruits
its
like
floating
on
a
rolling
flame
over
the
minions
crying
below
no
hop
presence
all
malt
and
sin
really
quite
outstanding
glad
to
have
shared
it
with
some
good
men
happy
there
are
a
few
more
bottles
of
that
left
so
sumptuous
thick
but
without
too
much
sweetness
damn
nice
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
small
tight
head
loads
of
things
going
on
in
the
aroma
department
bourbon
oak
vanilla
caramel
brown
sugar
and
bits
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
very
similar
with
the
barrelaging
really
coming
through
love
the
combo
that
midnight
sun
has
done
unbelievably
lush
mouthfeelsuper
creamy
with
the
perfect
tint
of
alcohol
warmth
which
was
quite
necessary
waiting
out
there
in
line
great
drinkability
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
barleywines
d
uh
this
is
great
it
reached
all
my
expectations
and
that
is
saying
a
lot
because
i
have
been
wanting
this
beer
for
about
two
years
now
the
flavors
and
aroma
are
just
so
distinct
and
present
this
is
probably
the
best
midnight
sun
brew
i
have
had
thus
far
just
so
well
crafted
its
amazing
rock
on
midnight
sun
rock
on
reino
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
it
really
displayed
the
barrel
aged
characteristics
well
without
being
too
overwhelming
the
maltiness
of
it
came
through
very
well
and
was
complemented
by
the
barrel
aging
unlike
some
i
try
where
it
tastes
like
a
shot
of
bourbon
was
added
to
the
beer
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
now
i
have
to
take
a
nap
after
drinking
the
bottle
myself
d
a
very
nice
english
barleywine
a
22
ozer
got
a
little
slow
for
me
towards
the
end
overall
overall
it
would
probably
be
in
my
top
5
for
the
style
anyway
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
steady
carbonation
not
overly
heavy
and
ends
up
being
quite
a
tasty
drink
this
is
a
damn
tasty
barleywine
that
holds
nothing
back
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
works
and
packs
a
hefty
malt
punch
with
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
to
match
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
bw
one
of
my
favs
better
than
most
but
remotely
as
good
as
the
perfect
storm
and
probably
not
a
top
100
beer
d
at
10
or
thereabouts
this
is
a
sipping
beer
at
best
one
and
done
for
this
sleepytime
cowboy
overall
this
is
a
great
english
barleywine
lots
of
smooth
malts
fruits
and
some
nice
wood
character
midnight
sun
has
really
done
a
fantastic
job
with
this
beer
the
only
one
that
ive
had
that
tops
this
is
a
1999
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
with
that
being
said
i
think
ill
put
another
35
years
on
the
next
bottle
i
have
in
the
cellar
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
it
should
be
a
very
enjoyable
winters
night
tonight
my
only
wish
for
it
to
come
in
smaller
bottles
or
with
a
hinge
cap
otherwise
its
quite
yummy
2008
vintage
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
ruby
color
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
raisin
and
honey
wheat
and
brown
sugar
with
a
bit
of
copper
hops
and
creamy
yeast
and
alcohol
it
tasted
like
toffee
and
brown
sugar
and
alcohol
with
some
raisin
and
honey
wheat
it
was
oily
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
solid
english
barleywine
with
nice
malty
scent
and
taste
and
good
body
it
was
still
pretty
potent
even
after
a
year
of
aging
so
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
whisky
and
oak
flavors
werent
very
apparent
which
was
somewhat
disappointing
but
this
is
still
a
great
brew
and
very
enjoyable
the
body
is
on
the
full
side
of
medium
there
is
definitely
a
big
alcohol
presence
so
if
you
are
drinking
this
one
with
a
year
or
less
on
it
i
would
definitely
recommend
splitting
it
with
2
or
3
other
people
a
very
fine
sipping
beer
but
one
that
i
will
age
for
a
few
years
before
cracking
again
d
a
definite
cool
weather
beer
but
not
too
sweet
or
overwhelming
that
it
would
only
be
a
nightcap
easy
to
drink
a
bottle
without
completely
blowing
out
the
palate
this
was
my
first
ms
beer
and
i
was
impressed
this
one
tasted
fantastic
and
still
could
go
for
a
few
more
years
it
was
the
perfect
beer
to
have
on
the
stormiest
october
day
in
sf
in
47
years
thanks
to
beerworldalex
for
this
generous
extra
poured
into
my
duck
rabbit
snifter
2007
vintage
pours
a
murky
cherry
brown
with
a
thin
lacing
of
head
around
the
edges
loads
of
sweet
malt
toffee
caramel
also
notice
some
spice
awesomely
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
just
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finsih
which
is
perfect
toffee
caramel
and
mild
oak
nutmeg
light
cherries
on
taste
this
will
warm
you
up
the
beer
pours
dark
clear
brown
without
much
head
buckets
of
hops
in
the
nose
with
chocolate
covered
caramels
some
nice
cherry
as
well
this
thing
has
tons
of
hot
alcohol
but
theres
still
plenty
of
malt
and
hops
good
stuff
but
id
hoped
for
better
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
an
modest
head
that
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
maple
syrupy
sweet
i
loved
the
smell
the
taste
was
molasses
alcohol
and
dark
fruit
prunes
mostly
feel
was
heavy
bodied
thick
chewy
and
oily
smooth
drinkability
was
only
above
average
due
to
the
high
abv
and
extreme
sweetness
i
liked
a
devil
a
lot
but
3f
behemoth
still
my
favorite
barley
wine
overall
an
excellent
beer
worthy
of
the
praise
its
my
first
midnight
sun
and
wont
be
the
last
if
they
are
all
this
good
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
very
highly
recommend
rotation
not
avail
here
and
had
to
get
thru
mail
order
so
this
might
be
my
only
try
of
it
for
awhile
if
here
id
like
a
bottle
a
year
d
hot
damn
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
tastiest
most
complex
barleywines
ive
ever
had
i
was
indeed
stunned
simply
put
arctic
devil
is
a
fantastic
traditional
english
style
barleywine
to
say
the
least
i
would
even
go
so
far
as
saying
this
is
the
finest
of
its
kind
available
anywhere
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
and
one
hell
of
an
introduction
for
me
to
midnight
sun
brewerey
i
must
find
more
22
ounce
bottle
acquired
in
a
trade
as
an
extra
from
urwatuh8
thanks
again
richard
drank
with
chelsea
and
drake
last
night
poured
into
my
dogfish
head
snifter
color
is
a
dark
brown
with
some
dark
reddish
edges
two
inch
foamy
beige
head
that
stays
around
about
five
minutes
some
lacing
at
first
aroma
consists
of
dark
fruits
sweet
malts
caramel
toffee
sweet
brown
sugar
booze
and
very
light
hops
flavor
starts
off
with
a
big
caramel
flavor
with
some
sweetness
some
dark
ripened
fruits
in
the
middle
that
were
mostly
berries
pretty
big
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
more
sweet
malts
and
lots
of
toffee
come
out
towards
the
end
but
there
is
still
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
present
sweet
boozy
malty
and
fruity
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
for
the
style
taste
lingers
pretty
well
could
drink
this
bomber
probably
but
alcohol
is
there
not
too
sweet
or
heavy
considering
though
my
bottles
said
10
abv
so
it
seems
this
particular
year
is
lighter
than
past
years
believe
this
was
the
2008
vintage
could
probably
use
more
age
regardless
taste
is
still
a
bit
hot
but
it
seems
like
the
cellar
will
really
make
this
a
world
class
barleywine
it
is
already
well
on
its
way
would
drink
again
recommended
a
unique
and
spectacular
take
on
the
style
a
beer
to
be
sought
out
by
any
barleywine
lover
pours
a
hazy
translucent
empty
beer
bottle
color
with
a
full
finger
frosted
tan
collar
that
fades
fairly
quickly
to
surface
leaving
negligible
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
amazing
and
classic
the
aroma
is
huge
and
rich
sweet
caramel
and
butterscotch
lightly
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
and
has
a
tangy
character
from
the
alcohol
and
salty
notes
that
compliment
the
flavors
extremely
well
and
linger
nicely
full
flavored
the
taste
mirrors
the
nose
the
caramel
character
is
deep
and
slightly
roasted
but
the
butterscotch
note
has
the
leading
role
in
this
play
an
amazing
drinker
the
13
2
abv
is
really
well
integrated
but
be
advised
this
one
needs
to
be
savored
or
youll
get
stupid
highly
recommended
many
thanks
to
koopa
for
this
opportunity
im
very
confused
first
of
all
because
my
bottle
says
its
10
abv
and
here
its
13
probably
just
different
years
im
guessing
pours
virtually
black
but
upon
closer
inspection
its
more
of
a
deep
deep
deep
mahogany
color
light
tan
head
2
finger
with
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
rich
of
caramel
vanilla
sweet
syrup
and
cream
a
bit
of
booze
too
taste
is
similar
very
rich
flavors
of
cream
caramel
sweet
syrup
vanilla
some
light
coffee
very
thick
and
full
you
could
probably
use
a
spoon
with
this
stuff
velvety
and
creamy
as
it
goes
down
strong
warming
sensation
too
overalll
a
good
and
complex
beer
a
little
sweeter
than
i
prefer
i
think
if
there
were
a
little
more
hops
present
which
i
detected
none
of
this
would
be
a
great
beer
but
for
now
ill
just
say
its
good
drinkability
exceptional
deserty
feel
that
says
drink
me
faster
and
faster
huh
what
is
this
doing
in
the
top
100
let
alone
the
1
english
bw
or
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
tried
an
08
of
this
last
night
that
i
had
been
sitting
on
since
january
09
the
color
was
a
garnet
brown
with
just
a
smidge
of
head
the
nose
was
sweet
with
burnt
caramel
and
dark
amber
syrup
on
the
palate
a
small
burst
of
carbonation
followed
by
sweetness
caramel
burnt
toffee
dark
fruits
christmas
pudding
treacle
unsulphured
molasses
brown
sugar
and
gently
cloying
long
finish
this
is
a
delightful
english
style
barley
wine
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
awesome
beer
fresh
or
aged
good
full
body
with
ideal
carbonation
thats
silky
smooth
and
creamish
good
dose
of
alcohol
that
never
gets
in
the
way
and
really
adds
to
the
delivery
of
the
flavor
this
is
one
barleywine
that
is
as
drinkable
as
they
come
its
great
now
and
becomes
even
greater
with
some
age
on
it
a
must
try
if
you
love
bwines
drinkability
another
skillful
release
from
midnight
sun
barleywines
are
addicting
enough
on
their
own
but
arctic
devil
takes
it
to
a
whole
new
level
of
hedonistic
indulgence
overall
an
exemplary
brew
drinkability
reminds
me
of
homemade
grain
alcohol
cut
with
burnt
sugar
and
cherries
that
i
had
at
a
bachelor
party
one
time
170
proof
and
tasted
like
cherry
syrup
dangerous
stuff
except
this
actually
tastes
good
extremely
smooth
extremely
drinkable
and
probably
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
since
old
ruffian
crazy
good
stuff
mucho
recommended
thanks

meal

some
hints
of
old
ale
unfortunate
that
so

a
must

who
like
a
barleywine

its
not
always
about
how
a
beer
looks

tastes
its
how
you
engage
with
it
like
the
mighty
stallion
this
is
something
recognizably
bigger
than
ourselves
to
whom
we
treat
with
gentle
praise
and
respect
you
approach
and
interact
with
the
beer
in
slow
respectful
sips
you
both
acknowledge
and
appreciate
its
power
and
in
this
case
i
must
also
acknowledge
and
appreciate
the
generous
buckeyenation
for
providing
me
with
the
sample
taste
matches
the
aroma
well
with
lots
of
complex
toffee
malts
and
a
flavorful
boozy
liquor
presence
of
brandy
and
rum
bread
and
biscuits
lurk
in
the
background
with
a
pinch
of
earthen
hops
body
is
smooth
to
no
end
not
creamy
with
a
nearperfect
carbonation
level
and
a
mediumthick
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
only
a
fantastic
introduction
to
midnight
sun
but
a
great
barleywine
as
well
highly
recommended
viscous
sticky
texture
quite
drinkable
for
what
it
is
d
very
drinkable
a
spendy
beer
at
15
a
pop
so
something
you
bring
out
for
a
special
treat
very
happy
that
this
beer
is
very
available
in
oregon
tremendous
barley
wine
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
rich
with
some
carbonation
drinkability
10
along
with
the
sweetish
thick
mouthfeel
does
not
make
the
drinkability
that
high
with
that
being
said
i
finished
this
beer
no
problem
purchased
liquid
solutions
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
poured
a
rich
thick
borwn
that
cant
be
seen
through
a
rich
creamy
five
finger
head
rises
to
the
top
and
stays
awhile
the
smell
is
rich
grain
and
alchoal
with
a
sweet
fig
overtone
the
flavor
is
figs
hazelnuts
molasses
honney
sweet
malt
a
hint
of
folaral
hops
then
malt
for
days
this
hides
the
alochal
well
and
is
a
beer
that
i
would
love
to
get
more
of
d
i
could
drink
this
as
much
as
i
was
physically
capable
great
stuff
d
in
spite
of
the
high
abv
i
had
no
difficulty
with
this
one
a
truly
exceptional
barleywine
in
my
view
hop
lovers
may
be
disappointed
this
is
the
antithesis
of
a
san
diego
beer

a
murky

by
the

mostly
dark

dates

add
an
interesting

a
good
dose
of
booze
can
be
detected
in
each
whiff
too
taste
starts
off
with
a
strong
alcohol
sting
followed
by
syrupy
caramel
malts
and
earth
midway
more
booze
with
licorice
molasses
and
brown
sugar
the
finish
burns
the
back
of
my
throat
with
spice
and
rich
nutty
flavors
malt
monster
from
start
to
finish
lacking
the
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
big
body
and
a
strong
sting
from
what
else
but
the
alcohol
along
with
a
flowing
carbonation
the
10
is
clearly
there
and
if
i
didnt
know
ahead
of
time
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
upwards
of

i
gotta
go

am
extremely
gracious
that
i
had
the
gumption
to
open
this
bottle
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
but
was
just
afraid
of
opening
it
up
drinking
this
makes
me
want
to
move

the

definitely
no

coming
through

the

is
a
nice
sweet

the
taste
is
pretty
over
powering
you
start
out
with
the

licorice
taste
and
then
it
becomes
more
sweet

a

there

really
enjoy
this

barleywine
and
have
managed
to
store
another

to

for
a

am
sure
the

will
settle
down
some

and
i
have
to
say
it
certainly
hasnt
let
me
down
with

i
dont
think
this
is
really
my
type
of
beer
more
of
those
every
once
and
a
while
brews
its
huge
at
around
14
so
after
the
bomber
is
done
youve
got
a
nice
little
buzz
on

definitely
recommend
sipping
on
this
one

take
the

thought
about

worth
the

of
acquiring
d
this
might
be
the
best

i

i
thought
this
was
an
outstanding
selection
from
ms
really
a
top
notch
beer
here
not
so
much
a
barley
wine
as
it
was
a
bit
bigger
then
that
very
good
though
and
something
that
i
will
look
to
buy
a
few
to
cellar
d
i
think
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
the
abv
seems
to
be
quite
potent
in
this
brew
or
perhaps
i
should
have
just
eaten
more
for
lunch
d
extremely
good
for
the
style
and
abv
i
could
have
enjoyed
an
entire
bomber
myself
overall
a
very
good
english
barleywine
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
i
lean
more
toward
hoppier
american
barleywines
but
i
found
this
quite
enjoyable
i
imagine
this
would
age
quite
well
but
its
drinking
quite
nicely
right
now
drinkability
is
moderate
the
alcohol
presence
is
hard
to
avoid
in
a
strong
bwine
like
this
but
the
flavors
and
complexity
make
up
for
the
high
abv
nice
postdinner
drink
that
you
will
want
to
enjoy
slowly
and
probably
wouldnt
drink
all
night
long
a
very
solid
barleywine
one
of
my
favs
drinks
great
for
the
style
this
is
a
great
english
barley
wine
with
a
bit
of
a
twist
this
devil
will
get
to
you
before
you
get
to
him
great
offering
better
than
this
rating

well
taste
is
similarly
malty
with
a
dark
sweet

and
nutty
flavor
somewhat
prailine
like
really
nice
flavor
aside
from
the
somewhat
strong
alcohol
presence
which
by
the
2nd
glass
definitely
detracts
from
the
beer
moderate
body
to
perhaps
a
bit
sticky
and
syrupy
but
definitely
not
overly
so
i
really
loved
the
unique
nutty
fruity
malty
flavor
in
this
and
would
like
it
even
more
if
the
alcohol
tamed
down
with
age
unique
and
really
nice
but
hard
to
justify
the
price
i
paid
drinkability
is
way
to
good

to

im
pissed
that
i
paid
so
much
for
it
without
really
noticing
oh
well
oh
i
guess
that
says
how
much
i
liked
it
doesnt
it
cause
well
i
didnt
really
like
it
its
syrupy
sweet
with
little
to
no
bitterness
and
that
alone
yeah
only
its
weird
its
not
the
syrup
of
a
lees
its
more
like
a
chocolate
syrup
weird
only
not
really
in
a
good
way
not
thrilled
with
it
nice
and
thick
not
opaque
enough
but
really
nice
head
too
sweet
and
thick
without
the
bitterness
well
like
an
english
barleywine
yawn
this
barleywine
is
glorious
now
i
cant

to

the
difference
between
this
and
averys
mephistopheles
stout
at
16
is
like
night
and
day
i
should
have
let
this
age
for
a
few
years
pricey
at
15
99
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
johns

portland
or
i
am
eager
to
see
how
this
does
with
some
age
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
i
wouold
suspect
that
this
will
age
wonderfully
very
nice
definitely
one
to
seek
out
still
overall
it
remains
smooth
and

much
more
syrupy

your

brew
taste
is
very
warm

sugary
and
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
most
american
brewed
barley
wines
goes
down
smooth
with
the
exception
of
a
slight

twinge
at
the
finishvery
bearable
twinge
not
like
samichlaus

anything
but
i
suspect
the
alcohol
finish
will
disappear
with
age
and
some
of
the
dark
fruit
flavors
present
will
increase
with
a
few
years
i
could
see
this
as
one
of
the
top
barley
wines
in
america

a

just

is
also
full

with
some
liquor
taste
on
the

the

is

crisp

bitey
however
with

taste
makes
the

now
a

rough

it

improveand
by

rest

and
entices
the
senses
on
the
long
finish
perfect
for
a
cold
ohio
night
or
better
yet
an
alaskan

drinkability
is
great
this
is
really
10
abv
could
have
fooled
me
a
classic
barley
wine
exceptionally
crafted
smooth
tasty
and
with
a
wonderful
warmth
while
going
down
the
throat
seek
this
beer
out
its
that
good
i
must
admit
i
expected
good
to
great
things
from
arctic
devil
barley
wine
but
i
didnt
expect
the
magnum
opus
that
is
currently
occupying
my
snifter
if
you
love
great
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
do
anything
it
takes
to
acquire
a
bomber
of
this
outstanding
elixir
this
is
my
new
gold
standard
for
the
english
barleywine
style
get
one
if
you
can
well
worth
the
effort
this
beer
was
much
darker
then
the
other
beers
and
had
something
of
smokey
quality
that
none
of
the
other
beers
had
muted
nose
but
on
the
palate
one
got
flavors
of
cola
caramel
and
smoke
the
beer
was
fairly
viscuous
and
was
quite
sweet
it
ended
with
a
long
smooth
finish
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
a
good
beer
but
not
as
fine
as
i
remembered
hands
down
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
getting
through
this
bomber
will
wax
me
but
hell
i
need
to
get
to
bed
anyway

the

in

as
i
get
into
it
a
nice
spiciness
on
the
tongue
and
a
sharp
bite
at
the
back
of
the
throat
a
very
nice
barleywine
i
would
definitely
say
this
is
much
more
of
an
american
style
than
english
as
it
is
classified
here
easy
to
drink
for
its
strength
id
love
to
have
a

of
these

along
with
the

brings
slight

the

makes
up
for
it

a

if
you
see

in

grab
some
an

before
i

i
must

beware

newly

kentucky

really
hits
and
hits
hard
really
waking
up
the
senses
and
quite
appetizing
now
i
really
liked
the
flavors
of
this
beer
but
whoo
they
hit
yavery
woody
and
whiskish
if
thats
a
word
with
vanilla
and
caramel
standing
out
as
well
the
alcohol
burn
steals
the
show
it
actually
burned
my
nose
going
down
this
beer
weighs
in
at
14
alc
although
the
label
says
10
that
according
to
the
head
brewer
at
midnight
sun
and
it
feels
like
more
than
that
a
very
good
very
complex
barley
wine
but
these
need
to
be
laid
down
for
awhile
thats
for
sure
flavors
that
would
complement
the
five
star
meals
served
by
the
two
chefs
attending
emit
and
randy

their

a

noted
that
it
was
still
hoppy
thinking
that
it
was
this
years
release
and
could
use
a
few
more
month
in
the
cellar
i
did
not
tell
him
it
was
already
had
a
year
of
aging
i
found
the
hopmalt
balance
very
nice
with
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
countering
the
sweetness
this
is
one
rich
beer
almost
overpoweringly
so
and
is
dominated
by
dark
fruit
flavors
the
finish
is
impressive
too
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
too
much
this
brew
would
be
a
little
more
drinkable
if
the
sweetness
were
a
milder
still
highly
recommended
comments

ms
skyhand
busted
out
this
barley
for
her
first
annual
bring
on
da
booze
festival
and
personally
it
was
the
highlight
of
the
evening
for
me
dark
ruddy
muddy
dirty
cola
coloured
brown
with
a
fizzy
fizzly
head
that
dies
out
quickly
aromas
are
all
raisins
dark
fruits
plums
residual
sugars
and
not
really
a
hint
of
booze
impressive
taste
follows
suit
with
plenty
of
malty
dark
fruit
flavors
and
candied
spicy
flavors
rum
raisin
cake
maybe
this
is
really
like
an
old
ale
not
so
much
of
a
barleywine
but
hey
whos
keepin
score
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
a
nice
one
from
ak
a
better
head
retention
a
touch
more
complexity
and
a
little
less
alcohol
would
bring
this
up
into
world
class
status
very
nice
drinkability
is
really
high
great
example
of
style
incredibly
wellbalanced
drinkability
and
overall
ok
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
one
of
the
more
perfect
beers
in
the
world
i
know
its
hard
to
find
but
if
you
ever
come
across
this
beer
you
have
to
try
it
honestly
a
killer
beer
that
is
damn
near
impossible
to
beat
i
bow
before
this
beer
nice
one
midnight
sun
further
into
the
bottle
prunes
are
the
predominant
flavor
not
tasted
earlier
this
was
easily
the
worst
thing
i
have
ever
drank
it
was
like
someone
took
a
cheap
red
wine
and
mixed
it
with
a
cheap
american
lager
ala
bud
light
i
bought
a
pack
weeks
ago
and
cant
even
get
drunk
enough
to
stomach
it
just
frigging
terrible
this
beer
has
good
taste
from
being
to
end
id
buy
it
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
it
a
nice
example
of
an
english
style
barleywine
but
in
the
end
it
didnt
turn
out
as
great
as
some
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
it
just
lacked
the
complexity
and
big
mouthfeel
that
some
of
that
better
ones
seem
to
have
and
it
left
me
wanting
more
this
beer
has
nice
drinkability
its
fairly
smooth
not
too
cloying
slightly
crisp
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
is
a
good
amount
for
me
i
dont
really
have
the
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
besides
lacking
it
complexity
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
things
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
is
the
lack
of
complexity
that
aspect
could
use
some
work
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
im
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
stock
up
on
it
and
i
would
say
it
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
needs
a
little
work
but
i
think
it
has
potential
its
not
a
favorite
weyerbacher
beer
and
its
right
about
average
for
the
style
nice
job
guys
but
i
think
with
a
little
more
work
this
could
be
a
very
nice
barleywine
so
good
tried
it
for
the
first
time
today
just
to
get
a
high
percentage
in
very
pleasantly
surprised
awesome
beer
little
boozy
not
more
than
one
an
evening
for
me
the
oxidation
and
higher
alcohols
definitely
ruin
this
for
me
not
a
very
good
or
very
well
brewed
beer
i
definitely
wouldnt
buy
this
again
drain
pour
blithering
indeed
overall
this
pours
well
and
smells
halfway
decent
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
rather
bizarre
and
offputting
looked
good
had
some
interesting
aromas
some
sort
of
spicy
hop
or
yeast
note
that
was
interesting
along
with
some
bready
maltiness
fell
apart
on
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
really
muddy
nothing
distinct
or
stand
out
shining
through
would
not
recommend
still
havent
found
a
decent
weyerbacher
brew
a
little
light
on
the
nose
and
slightly
dry
for
my
tastes
but
overall
a
great
barley
wine
the
newer
batches
must
be
much
better
then
the
old
overall
people
have
compared
this
to
cough
syrup
and
i
have
to
agree
that
to
an
extent
it
does
have
a
cherry
cough
syrup
very
little
balance
no
depth
and
really
just
kind
of
a
big
ol
mess
maybe
it
would
age
to
something
better
but
i
wont
be
the
one
to
try
it
cherry
taste
just
wish
it
was
a
little
thicker
this
has
been
a
household
fav
for
a
few
years
now
young
for
a
barleywine
give
new
batches
some
age
this
is
a
pretty
good
beerbest
served
not
too
cold
and
i
usually
love
big
hop
finishes
but
something
about
this
beer
just
didnt
sit
quite
right
with
me
which
is
a
bit
of
a
bummer
overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
barleywine
excellent
in
fact
it
has
great
flavors
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
maple
syruplike
sweetness
dried
stone
fruit
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
only
thing
keeping
this
barleywine
from
being
worldclass
is
the
slightly
less
than
perfect
mouthfeel
if
it
had
a
chewier
mouthfeel
it
would
be
worldclass
a
good
representative
of
the
style
though
i
think
cellar
aging
could
improve
this
by
allowing
the
alcohol
to
settle
down
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
ill
give
this
one
another
look
in
a
year
or
so
pure
joy
in
my
mouth
ok
a
beer
worth
trying
but
probably
never
drinking
again
had
to
finish
off
weyerbachers
locally
available
at
some
point
i
guess
trudging
through
brews
like
this
is
inevitable
wouldnt
ever
go
near
this
again
looked
smelled
great
but
went
all
down
hill
from
there
couldnt
get
past
the
strong
cough
syrup
flavor
this
one
definitely
needs
to
be
aged
otherwise
its
damn
near
undrinkable
overall
this
is
an
intense
version
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
drink
again
as
i
appreciate
the
occasional
big
bad
malt
bomb
however
i
prefer
to
share
it
as
the
syrupy
sweetness
can
become
a
bit
much
poured
a
cloudy
rubytinted
copper
with
a
barelythere
white
head
no
lacing
whatsoever
the
aroma
is
light
but
does
have
some
nice
caramel
and
dark
fruit
notes
im
thinking
dried
figs
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
more
robust
with
a
little
more
depth
to
the
fruit
and
sugars
and
a
nice
warming
effect
from
the
alcohol
the
body
has
a
nice
thickness
to
it
and
a
little
tingle
to
it
on
the
finish
i
just
read
that
this
is
an
english
barleywine
which
apposed
to
american
barleywines
which
are
super
hopped
these
are
more
fruity
makes
sense
today
i
learned
very
smooth
there
was
just
something
from
the
initial
taste
through
the
ending
that
just
didnt
sit
right
with
me
in
aroma
as
well
as
taste
overall
a
pretty
good
barley
wine
but
not
exceptional
i
hope
to
revisit
this
amazing
invention
at
a
later
date
hopefully
no
where
near
a
national
election
as
that
is
blithering
season
blithering
idiot
is
a
good
barleywine
i
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
saying
that
i
should
also
say
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
barleywines
so
keep
that
in
mind
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
big
light
brown
foam
head
not
much
retention
a
little
bit
of
lacing
nothing
too
out
there
in
the
aroma
sweet
caramel
and
bready
malts
slight
hint
of
toffee
a
bit
of
booze
taste
is
a
little
underwhelming
some
dark
fruits
most
notably
cherry
and
fig
sweet
malts
a
ton
of
booze
very
poorly
masked
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
give
it
a
sort
of
candylike
taste
cant
get
over
the
alcohol
though
it
is
very
offsetting
compared
to
the
slightly
more
subdued
taste
not
a
good
combo
not
much
carbonation
easier
to
drink
than
youd
expect
but
still
not
the
most
pleasant
experience
overall
not
super
impressed
by
my
first
entry
into
the
english
barley
wine
realm
hopefully
not
a
sign
of
the
style
as
a
whole
o
decent
barleywine
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
spices
maybe
more
hops
more
complexity
o
better
beer
than
what
previous
rankings
give
it
credit
for
if
you
wanted
a
barleywine
than
i
would
recommend
third
coast
old
ale
by
bells
brewery
which
is
great
even
though
it
is
an
american
barleywine
and
blithering
idiot
is
english
i
think
the
styles
are
similar
enough
worth
trying
especially
if
you
are
interested
in
this
kind
of
brew
o
very
sweet
the
dark
fruits
are
nice
taste
of
plum
and
the
figsdates
are
rather
different
but
its
almost
too
sweet
at
times
a
sipper
palate
full
creamy
soft
carbonation
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
overall
didnt
really
enjoy
this
i
havent
tried
it
for
some
time
and
it
was
really
my
gateway
beer
into
higher
alcohol
and
barleywine
style
beers
i
remember
enjoying
it
at
the
time
but
i
guess
since
then
ive
found
so
much
better
options
in
both
english
and
american
style
still
a
fondness
for
it
and
you
cant
beat
the
name
o
in
the
mood
for
a
barleywine
from
weyerbacher
get
insanity
instead
the
barrel
aging
takes
the
edge
off
of
well
pretty
much
everything
about
this
one
i
wouldnt
even
think
about
touching
this
again
unless
i
knew
it
had
at
least
a
year
on
it
four
months
hasnt
exactly
done
the
trick
weyerbachers
worst
offering
as
far
as
im
concerned
not
the
most
balanced
barleywine
the
fruitiness
feels
a
bit
chaotic
gets
a
bit
too
sweet
and
boozy
close
to
the
finish
careful
with
this
one
or
youll
end
up
talking
like
a
blithering
idiot
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
smelled
like
a
ripe
banana
after
popping
the
cap
even
more
so
in
the
glass
probably
the
strangest
smellingtasting
beer
ive
ever
had
i
like
the
lack
of
hops
but
i
cant
seem
to
like
anything
else
again
im
reminded
to
do
a
more
detailed
analysis
before
i
make
a
blind
purchase
overall
this
is
a
fairly
nice
barelywine
that
i
have
loved
for
quite
some
time
it
could
use
a
little
more
time
in
the
bottle
to
get
rid
of
a
little
bit
of
the
sweetness
but
it
is
not
bad
in
any
way
really
this
tastes
like
a
small
barleywine
that
could
be
a
little
thicker
and
more
robust
for
the
style
i
love
the
beer
and
would
love
to
drink
it
plenty
but
it
just
isnt
a
true
barleywine
as
i
have
drank
its
a
little
thin
and
just
not
robust
as
i
would
expect
still
a
great
beer
for
the
abv
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
that
strong
it
tastes
like
it
could
be
8abv
instead
of
11abv
so
it
does
mask
the
alcohol
and
seems
like
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
but
certainly
not
a
session
beer
due
to
the
high
abv
overall
i
have
quite
a
sweet
spot
for
a
decent
barleywine
this
one
falls
a
little
short
of
the
mark
though
it
is
a
bit
onedimensional
but
still
a
worthwhile
drink
every
now
and
then
appearance
is
a
brownish
copper
with
a
half
finger
of
head
the
head
dissipated
rather
quickly
the
nose
had
the
slight
hint
of
sweetness
the
malt
flavors
are
not
nearly
as
hearty
as
they
should
be
considering
the
style
the
lightness
of
the
malt
makes
the
alcohol
tastes
strong
and
intrusive
the
only
real
highlight
of
this
offering
is
the
trace
of
dark
fruits
in
the
flavor
pretty
hard
to
drink
and
without
the
complexities
or
flavours
that
warrant
the
level
of
booziness
its
a
big
beer
but
it
doesnt
justify
being
as
big
as
it
is
had
this
with
dinner
at
brass
rail
in
hoboken
pours
a
deep
beautiful
red
color
clear
with
a
nice
creamy
half
finger
head
on
top
aroma
is
subdued
with
toffee
caramel
sweet
brown
sugar
some
dark
fruit
flavor
is
big
time
malts
toffee
caramel
molasses
maybe
some
sweet
sweet
dark
fruits
like
plums
and
figs
very
sweet
brown
sugar
heavy
thick
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
very
solid
barleywine
and
now
looking
forward
to
trying
some
insanity
o
definitely
a
tasty
english
barleywine
i
would
have
liked
the
fruits
in
here
to
pop
a
little
more
but
for
an
11
beer
this
drinks
incredibly
smooth
this
is
definitely
a
sweet
beer
that
is
a
sipper
i
think
its
worth
picking
up
i
love
sweet
beers
and
the
english
style
barleywines
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
is
its
aroma
this
aspect
of
it
is
actually
rather
boastful
with
each
component
taking
a
big
stand
looking
for
all
the
attention
it
was
however
disproportionate
when
followed
by
that
flavoring
with
huge
booziness
in
the
nose
that
was
extremely
dampened
in
the
finished
product
on
the
palate
perhaps
this
was
to
its
benefit
hoping
cloy
would
be
more
appealing
to
people
than
harshness
so
that
said
nothing
was
really
offensive
about
this
beer
it
just
came
across
as
quite
simple
and
light
to
the
touch
perhaps
the
nearly
three
years
we
put
on
it
was
to
its
detriment
but
according
to
the
brewer
they
are
confident
that
it
improves
up
to
five
years
in
the
bottle
wed
have
to
do
a
vertical
to
find
out
but
that
just
doesnt
seem
very
appealing
at
present
on
a
happyinterestingmostly
unrelated
note
this
is
our
first
review
since
getting
engaged
earlier
this
week
so
huzzah
bought
this
with
hopes
of
ageing
some
but
i
guess
ill
be
getting
a
good
buzz
tonight
instead
overall
a
decent
barleywine
but
not
one
id
seek
out
again
while
complex
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
both
a
bit
light
and
the
mouthfeel
certainly
didnt
help
in
that
respect
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
sample
o
a
tasty
beverage
for
sure
but
nothing
spectacular
i
really
want
big
flavor
from
this
style
of
beer
and
this
one
while
enjoyable
to
drink
is
rather
lacking
in
that
department
not
a
bad
brew
for
a
cold
night
though
warms
you
up
quickly
overall
3
00
this
is
an
ok
beer
regarding
its
taste
however
that
is
probably
not
why
people
buy
it
regardless
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
not
recommended
for
sessioning
as
the
11
abv
will
take
you
down
the
wobbly
path
to
the
village
of
puketown
where
you
will
be
introduced
to
their
leader
mayor
mctoiletbowl
this
isnt
an
amazing
english
barleywine
to
me
it
lacks
a
complex
rich
toffee
malt
character
instead
it
is
just
underattenuated
malt
overall
conforming
to
style
yet
not
an
impressive
example
i
will
drink
again
but
only
because
i
bought
a
4pack
o
lots
of
booze
and
dark
fruit
on
this
one
its
good
but
sort
of
middle
of
the
road
81
overall
i
believe
this
beer
to
be
above
average
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
something
on
the
more
unique
side
o
way
to
sweet
and
boozy
the
alcohol
lingers
in
your
mouth
and
its
just
not
tasty
enough
to
be
worth
it
ok
version
should
have
held
my
attension
fermally
yet
failed
full
bodied
warming
from
the
first
sip
not
refreshing
but
not
expecting
it
to
be
a
sipping
brew
for
certain
finish
is
a
bit
bitter
a
little
rough
overall
a
nice
brew
though
o
an
enjoyable
beer
though
i
wonder
if
would
get
more
complex
with
age
more
of
a
fan
of
the
bourbon
aged
offering
from
them
but
i
would
still
recommend
this
for
fans
of
the
english
barley
wine
style
great
english
barley
wine
i
think
weyerbacher
did
a
pretty
good
job
on
this
one
english
style
barley
wine
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
average
my
hope
is
that
because
this
bottle
might
have
malfunctioned
the
quality
of
this
beer
went
down
i
hope
i
get
another
chance
to
try
thing
one
somewhere
down
the
road
d
definitely
a
sipper
could
use
a
bit
of
refinement
hot
age
could
help
this
thing
can
do
a
lot
better
with
some
bourbon
and
since
they
do
that
see
insanity
go
try
that
version
it
is
exceptional
a
mediocre
english
style
barley
wine
i
like
american
styles
better
so
admittingly
my
scores
may
be
lower
served
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
with
a
fingers
worth
of
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
dark
brownish
red
color
smells
of
dark
rum
soaked
fruits
raisins
dates
and
fairly
hot
alchohol
taste
follows
the
nose
well
with
hardly
any
hop
prescence
with
a
medium
fairly
heavy
mouthfeel
not
a
horrible
english
style
bw
but
weyerbacher
i
feel
needs
to
use
more
hops
to
cut
the
sweetness
im
sure
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
would
do
this
beer
good
this
is
a
very
solid
english
barleywine
its
worth
checking
out
this
one
ages
extremely
well
too
o
interesting
take
on
a
a
barleywine
it
went
down
smooth
an
easy
o
with
all
its
pitfalls
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
not
as
incredible
as
insanity
but
it
holds
its
own
od
there
are
good
things
about
this
beer
you
can
really
tell
its
11
though
and
not
in
a
subtle
way
the
body
is
odd
too
not
a
bad
barleywine
but
probably
needs
time
has
potential
just
needs
to
mellow
out
the
boozy
character
lacked
complexity
for
its
abv
and
style
overall
coming
into
this
beer
i
was
surprised
by
the
alcohol
content
a
little
intimated
was
another
feeling
also
opening
and
pouring
were
normal
but
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
were
slightly
disappointing
the
mild
flavors
were
not
impressive
i
doubt
i
would
try
again
but
would
recommend
only
if
someone
wanted
low
hops
and
high
abv
cheers
o
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
i
think
the
palate
profile
is
very
similar
to
many
belgian
quads
ive
had
but
the
taste
and
aroma
are
both
real
nice
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
but
this
is
still
a
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
again
seems
like
a
pretty
nice
base
beer
for
barrel
aging
insanity
is
up
next
overall
good
beer
but
in
my
opinion
not
a
step
above
good
if
you
want
to
get
buzzed
quick
i
guess
it
works
but
i
want
more
than
just
that
definitely
needs
tweaking
but
still
worth
a
try
salud
overall
not
overly
complex
to
me
but
an
unbelievably
drinkable
beer
if
i
sip
er
slow
i
could
do
another
one
or
two
12ouncers
the
taste
is
mesmerizing
i
cant
properly
convey
what
the
taste
is
in
words
the
constituent
parts
wouldnt
properly
explain
anything
what
they
are
isnt
important
its
how
they
come
together
in
the
perfect
amounts
that
creates
perfection
or
maybe
its
just
brewed
with
immense
amounts
of
love
its
hard
to
say
anyway
it
has
the
intensity
smoothness
and
complexity
of
a
very
old
aged
whiskey
which
is
not
to
say
it
tastes
like
one
theres
no
whiskey
flavour
its
very
strong
the
alcohol
is
up
front
for
sure
along
with
the
smooth
sweetness
its
a
very
sweet
beer
but
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
the
background
for
you
analysis
connoisseurs
im
not
good
with
this
part
of
the
review
but
its
definitely
spicy
that
apple
flavour
present
in
the
nose
is
definitely
there
not
green
apples
but
sweet
apples
the
hops
are
mostly
spice
hops
but
theres
some
astringency
on
the
finish
as
well
theres
a
bit
of
that
apricot
i
detected
on
the
nose
in
there
as
well
with
about
of
that
straw
flavour
the
rest
is
all
malt
complexity
its
too
complex
for
me
to
understand
but
there
must
have
been
several
malts
used
in
this
all
i
can
say
is
they
are
all
excellent
and
used
in
perfect
proportion
now
im
going
to
stop
annoying
myself
by
trying
to
analyze
this
for
this
review
and
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
perfection
because
thats
what
this
beer
is
its
pure
perfection
you
dont
have
to
be
a
blithering
idiot
to
appreciate
it
but
youd
have
to
be
one
not
to
give
it
a
try
beware
the
bite
though
this
stuff
bites
like
19th
century
cough
medicine
so
be
warned
but
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thing
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
it
i
know
i
will
overallwhile
i
havent
had
many
barleywines
ive
had
enough
to
see
that
this
fails
to
compete
with
any
of
them
as
im
sipping
this
i
keep
thinking
im
drinking
a
strong
dunkel
not
a
barleywine
its
not
very
boozy
for
an
11
abv
beer
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
but
that
is
all
3
25
a
very
average
barleywine
that
runs
off
the
track
thanks
to
buschbeer
for
the
trade
a
powerful
beer
full
bodied
my
first
barley
wine
so
i
cant
compare
to
the
other
types
but
it
has
a
powerful
approach
with
strong
alcoholic
push
that
is
followed
by
a
smooth
and
calm
wash
its
very
smooth
it
will
get
you
there
quickly
and
youll
enjoy
the
ride
i
took
my
time
with
it
so
i
had
a
chance
to
drink
it
cold
and
warm
its
actually
better
at
room
temperature
if
you
plan
to
drink
it
slowly
good
stuff
especially
in
winter
overall
slighty
disappointed
with
this
beer
could
use
slightly
more
carbonation
but
it
does
hide
its
abv
very
well
its
like
drink
a
red
wine
more
than
a
beer
while
this
isnt
bigfoot
its
not
halfbad
certainly
nowhere
near
a
poor
rating
as
the
bros
have
it
maybe
the
recipe
has
changed
since
2001
i
dont
know
but
as
it
stands
in
2013
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
flavorwise
it
pours
with
little
head
and
not
much
aroma
beyond
the
caramel
sweetness
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
substantially
sweet
viscous
mouthfeel
and
decent
carbonation
ill
give
weyerbacher
credit
for
producing
an
11
1
abv
brew
with
almost
no
detectable
alcohol
its
certainly
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
it
does
fit
the
style
fairly
well
and
tastes
halfway
decent
more
of
a
beginners
barleywine
lacking
some
substance
and
hop
balance
there
are
better
barleywines
out
there
for
the
price
to
be
sure
but
im
glad
i
tried
this
at
least
a
solid
b
or
b
rating
from
me
o
i
have
to
admit
that
any
high
alcohol
brew
intimidates
me
to
a
degree
but
i
give
this
beer
full
marks
it
is
a
highly
smooth
brew
with
lots
of
rich
sweet
malty
goodness
and
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
you
really
dont
realize
that
this
sits
at
just
over
11
very
highly
drinkable
i
could
easily
put
back
a
couple
of
these
with
relative
ease
and
would
enjoy
the
feeling
that
im
sure
would
eventually
come
along
with
these
i
highly
recommend
this
one
and
think
anyone
who
really
enjoys
this
style
or
is
getting
into
it
will
appreciate
it
too
i
will
now
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
fine
ale
with
a
dinner
of
smoked
sausage
sauerkraut
and
perogies
this
should
pair
up
very
well
o
this
was
a
pretty
smooth
and
easy
drinker
unlike
a
lot
of
barleywines
especially
for
the
beefy
abv
with
that
being
said
however
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
least
complex
barleywines
i
have
had
my
head
wasnt
spinning
trying
to
track
all
of
the
aromas
and
flavors
like
others
have
done
overall
there
was
much
in
the
aroma
that
promised
a
full
sugary
rounded
barleywine
but
on
the
tongue
the
11
1
abv
simply
overpowered
everything
giving
the
beer
a
heavy
liqueur
overtone
were
this
actually
a
liqueur
it
would
be
deliciousbut
for
a
barleywine
it
comes
across
as
overly
strong
and
not
very
finely
nuanced
admittedly
im
drinking
this
fairly
fresh
off
the
bottling
line
so
im
going
to
put
the
rest
of
the
fourpack
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
or
so
and
hope
that
the
beer
calms
down
bottom
line
become
an
idiot
and
down
a
few
o
a
good
barley
wine
the
taste
of
the
graps
is
a
bit
too
strong
which
makes
it
harder
to
drink
it
after
the
first
glass
but
i
dont
expect
anything
else
from
a
barley
wine
lets
call
a
spade
a
spade
they
named
this
beer
well
overall
not
bad
certainly
not
a
great
barleywine
but
a
fairly
enjoyable
drink
sweetness
could
be
toned
down
d
an
ok
example
of
the
style
but
not
great
there
is
something
to
think
about
but
it
is
not
very
complex
probably
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
style
but
i
wont
purchase
again
overall
its
fairly
plain
for
a
barleywine
but
pleasant
nonetheless
i
dont
know
how
old
it
is
but
the
hopping
is
subtle
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
either
at
2
for
the
bottle
i
definitely
dont
regret
the
purchase
overall
not
bad
i
expected
a
little
more
sweetness
its
a
little
bit
thin
ive
got
a
few
more
to
age
so
maybe
the
booze
will
tone
down
a
bit
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
id
buy
again
with
so
many
world
class
bws
to
choose
from
overall
doesnt
look
smell
or
feel
that
bad
its
just
the
taste
that
makes
me
want
to
enjoy
other
examples
of
the
style
the
lack
of
hops
are
glaring
in
this
coupled
with
the
almost
autolyzed
yeast
character
i
dont
see
me
enjoying
this
again
which
is
surprising
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
other
weyerbacher
beers
o
very
strong
beer
not
much
to
look
at
but
the
cherries
and
toast
was
nice
good
winter
ale
this
is
an
interesting
beer
suitable
for
holiday
time
the
pours
is
a
copper
to
red
color
mostly
clear
but
with
some
yeast
floaters
hanging
around
under
a
short
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
honey
with
notes
of
dried
cherries
english
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
holiday
spice
the
alcohol
is
toxic
in
this
beer
though
its
at
the
forefront
in
the
nose
and
taste
and
really
burns
through
any
subtle
flavors
that
might
make
this
a
better
beer
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
of
this
one
i
though
the
body
is
full
and
the
bubbles
are
plentiful
but
its
just
not
something
anyone
could
handle
too
much
of
my
least
favorite
of
the
weyerbacher
big
beers
case
i
just
thought
the
alcohol
potency
overshadowed
the
intended
flavor

this

style
very
nice

and
very
smooth

a
very
enjoyable

i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
my
first
rating
not
sure
what
went
wrong
with
that
bottle
overall
just
not
that
excited
by
this
beer
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
hop
elements
even
though
i
recognize
that
this
is
in
the
english
barleywine
style
a
very
nice
beer
overall
very
sweet
yet
has
a
subtle
bitterness
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
and
the
boozy
flavor
wears
off
after
the
first
sip
very
complex
beer
and
very
fulfilling
overall
a
decent
english
barleywine
nice
and
creamy
bit
a
bit
one
dimensional
pours
a
cloudy
copper
aroma
is
extremely
inviting
with
rich
malt
rum
raisins
and
toffee
tons
going
on
here
brown
sugar
banana
raisins
toffee
even
a
hint
of
bubble
gum
plenty
of
the
requisite
malt
too
amazingly
the
alcohol
only
shows
up
warmth
and
dryness
in
the
finish
and
at
a
giant
11
1
abv
that
is
quite
a
task
i
see
where
the
name
came
from
it
is
dangerously
smooth
complex
and
tasty
deceptively
potent
pours
copper
with
a
khaki
head
aroma
shows
plenty
of
caramel
light
molasses
nuts
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
flavor
shows
the
same
with
additional
notes
of
raisins
brown
sugar
covered
grapefruit
dates
and
some
earthy
hops
overall
body
is
moderate
to
full
somewhat
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
hint
of
warming
alcohol
overall
well
not
really
one
i
enjoyed
as
much
as
i
was
hoping
a
little
too
much
rum
booze
and
a
somewhat
off
bitter
finish
which
prevented
me
from
finding
it
anything
i
would
want
to
go
back
to
again
full
mouth
that
commands
one
to
sip
rather
than
gulp
this
one
down
flavors
of
sweet
candied
malts
figs
raisins
and
hoppy
syrup
is
that
a
thing
tart
fruitlike
character
on
the
finish
a
little
boozy
but
not
as
detectable
as
anticipated
this
was
a
decent
offering
but
given
its
richness
as
well
as
its
sweetness
it
became
a
bit
tiring
as
the
12oz
went
along
not
sure
id
sit
down
with
this
one
again
o
nit
bad
but
not
the
greatest
its
already
been
put
away
for
7
months
and
it
def
not
s
boozey
as
it
was
before
but
i
still
dont
see
not
complexity
or
layering
on
the
beer
lost
cause
i
really
hope
not
overall
i
like
barleywine
i
was
disappointed
pretty
good
barleywine
definitely
enjoyable
might
try
aging
the
next
one
i
get
enjoyed
big
foot
more
this
one
appears
a
bit
tired
in
comparison
slightly
sour
and
tart
hops
here
although
i
wont
rush
to
get
this
again
its
not
bad
o
i
bought
this
one
and
a
weyerbacher
insanity
i
really
hope
the
insanity
fares
better
than
this
subpar
offering
nicely
low
carbonated
cheers
this
was
a
solid
barleywine
ale
with
some
of
the
typical
qualities
one
would
expect
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
hop
character
probably
due
to
the
english
theam
i
guess
sn
bigfoot
has
me
spoiled
o
overall
malt
this
beer
warms
up
nicely
and
winds
up
with
a
nice
caramelbrown
sugar
fruity
flavor
still
some
room
for
improvement
however
a
very
good
beer
regardless
overall
i
found
this
to
be
quite
enjoyable
nice
taste
profile
and
the
bready
malt
dark
fruit
and
sweetness
all
mesh
well
together
theres
some
heat
from
the
11
1
abv
but
its
not
overpowering
a
really
nice
interpretation
of
an
english
barleywine
this
is
a
nicely
flavored
beer
the
alcohol
is
present
and
slows
down
the
drinking
a
bit
otherwise
it
is
a
really
decent
offering
with
a
solid
body
and
good
malty
flavor
do
well
i
didnt
think
this
was
hitting
me
as
hard
as
it
now
has
getting
to
the
end
of
the
review
appearancearomaflavors
didnt
really
do
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
for
me
and
now
i
why
its
rated
the
way
it
is
pass
on
this
one
for
just
about
any
other
english
barleywine
o
nice
barleywine
nothing
really
stands
out
but
wellrounded
and
tasty
o
i
have
to
say
that
at
first
sip
it
is
very
very
harsh
you
have
to
take
a
few
sips
and
let
it
linger
to
acclimate
yourself
to
the
high
alcohol
i
think
this
one
needs
to
be
room
temperature
also
its
actually
pretty
good
once
you
make
it
past
the
initial
shock
still
the
alcohol
could
be
scaled
back
to
say
9
to
make
it
more
drinkable
from
the
start
but
its
unique
in
its
own
right
and
they
have
their
own
niche
with
this
one
a
bit
of
strong
alcohol
presence
lowers
my
experience
of
the
mouthfeel
overall
not
the
best
barley
wine
ive
had
but
i
could
envision
some
improvement
with
age
and
a
better
blending
of
the
flavors
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
just
happens
to
suit
my
taste
it
doesnt
have
the
crazy
complexity
of
say
a
jw
lees
vintage
ale
but
it
has
the
big
facecrushing
malt
you
might
find
in
two
of
my
favorite
styles
tripel
and
wee
heavy
o
a
pretty
out
of
whack
english
barleywine
here
from
weyerbacher
although
they
are
never
ones
to
shy
away
from
high
abvs
i
think
this
11
1
whomper
is
one
that
couldve
been
scaled
back
a
bit
in
the
name
of
balance
and
not
just
boozy
hot
mess

i
aint
a
hophead
but
this
is
one
sweet
beer
very
slow
sipper
o
this
beer
is
a
just
a
hint
to
sweet
for
me
to
consider
it
an
easy
to
drink
beer
also
the
high
abv
makes
this
a
sipping
beer
and
definitely
not
a
session
beer
there
is
no
way
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
there
is
just
a
hint
of
too
much
alcohol
presence
for
me
to
really
enjoy

this

seems
to
be
out
of
the
parameter
for
an
english
barleywine
however
it
does
have
some
good
flavors
working
o
decent
now
i
think
this
would
age
extremely
well
only
knocking
this
down
below
4
because
of
the
large
alcohol
presence
which
would
of
course
get
subdued
by
aging
definitely
along
the
lines
of
most
of
the
english
barleywines
ive
had
which
seems
to
be
difficult
for
american
breweries
to
pull
off
with
all
the
hopping
barrelaging
etc
going
on
again
certainly
good
now
but
ill
let
time
take
care
of
the
other
few
bottles
i
have
o
simply
because
this
beer
was
so
unremarkable
i
had
to
give
it
an
average
mark
this
is
my
2nd
weyerbacher
and
my
4th
or
5th
english
barleywine
but
i
have
been
loving
the
barleywines
ive
been
drinking
so
much
even
though
it
seems
the
majority
are
considered
american
barleywines
that
this
beer
simply
underwhelmed
me
im
used
to
big
american
barleywines
with
crazy
high
ibus
and
the
ability
to
strip
paint
off
walls
and
i
like
that

this
is
a

change

a

not

as

have

i
was
excited
to
try
this

i

from
the

this
was
going
to
be
a
drain
pour
an
overly
boozy

mess
here
oh
the
difference

can
make
i
cant
believe
insanity
is

this

it
isnt
the
worst
that
nod
goes

killer

im
not
a

fan
in

this
one
is
worth
a

to
try

somewhat
syrupy
alcohol
in
the
finish
quite
nice
and
warming
i
certainly
wouldnt
say
no
to
another
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
slightly
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
like
my
english
barleywines
a
little
thicker
a
little
more
malty
and
with
a
more
of
a
dark
fruit
flavor
d
love
bws
this
one
is
a

messy
but
fun

good

to

goes

overall
its

with

that
doesnt
suit
and
to
be
honest
it
be
nice
with
dessert
due
to
the
massive
sweetness
but
other
than
that
i
would
not
revisit
or
pay
good
money
for
as
it
really
is
sweetbomb
that
is
far
from
balanced
cheers
o
i
found
this
barleywine
to
be
very
overly
sweet
a
rare
disappointment
from
wyerbacher
not
necessarily
bad
but
definitely
not
my
kind
of
barley
wine
i
found
it
to
be
kind
of
bland
in
the
sense
that
it
didnt
have
the
bready
profile
that
most
english
barley
wines
have
kind
of
light
really
definitely
wouldnt
spend
my
money
on
this
again
o
seems
like
a
typical
average
barley
wine
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
over
any
others
would
drink
it
again
but
not
on
the
top
of
the
list
good
barleywine
b
which
seems
to
be
where
ive
ranked
all
the
weyerbacher
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
this
was
quite
good
surprisingly
enjoyed
it
as
im
not
normally
a
big
barleywine
fan
good
flavor
profile
with
enough
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweet
malty
flavor
and
a
really
nice
feel
to
support
it
all
a
quality
brew
and
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
recommended
poured
a
murky
darkened
amber
into
dimpled
mug
with
no
head
whatsoever
to
speak
of
smells
of
malt
dried
fruits
like
plum
and
raisin
maybe
a
little
cherry
with
zero
hop
at
all
as
an
english
type
barleywine
typically
is
more
malty
sweetness
wow
blast
of
sweetness
with
a
velvety
thick
finish
without
any
carbonation
at
all
mouthfeel
is
sweet
malty
velvet
that
coats
the
tongue
with
the
aforementioned
plum
and
raisin
and
a
good
strong
alcohol
presence
that
warms
and
makes
this
the
perfect
winter
weather
sipper
another
good
one
from
weyerbacher
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
it
has
a
warming
effect
which
just
might
be
due
to
all
the
alchohol
this
brew
would
be
better
with
a
few
more
hops
and
spices
to
mask
the
strong
alchohol
taste
o
overall
nothing
too
special
taste
and
smell
dont
have
a
ton
of
character
and
the
lingering
alcohol
potency
is
probably
a
bit
strong
beer
is
medium
in
body
chewy
sweet
it
is
fine
decent
barleywine
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
it
is
a
little
bitter
on
the
end
a
little
boozy
on
the
front
the
body
is
sweet
and
syrupy
i
might
have
it
again
if
there
was
nothing
else
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
going
to
have
to
pick
up
some
more
to
cellar
full
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
beer
could
definitely
be
more
than
just
a
sipper
if
not
for
the
11
1
abv
the
body
coats
your
mouth
well
and
has
a
bit
of
a
sticky
quality
to
it
the
carbonation
is
slightly
fizzy
but
is
definitely
needed
to
help
keep
the
body
from
becoming
syrupy
oalthough
it
is
an
english
barleywine
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
hops
would
have
done
this
beer
some
good
it
just
seemed
to
be
missing
a
little
in
the
way
of
hops
some
weyerbacher
beers
are
as
uninspiring
as
the
labels
that
adorn
them
o
just
an
average
barleywine
with
a
too
sweet
syrup
profile
mouthfeel
balanced
the
alcoholic
warmth
is
low
for
something
of
such
a
high
abv
3

overall
a
very
nice
barleywine
style
ale
thats
not
as
heavy
as
others
overalli
like
this
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
i
purchased
a
4
pack
at
the
store
after
eyeing
it
put
for
several
weeks
i
am
sipping
on
now
and
have
decieded
to
put
the
other
three
away
in
my
beer
cellar
there
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
present
as
some
did
mention
it
is
a
barleywine
so
i
expected
that
i
am
very
interested
to
see
how
it
matures
over
time
o
a
good
beer
they
could
have
stepped
back
the
alcohol
a
bit
but
the
alcohol
doesnt
destroy
the
other
flavors
but
doesnt
exactly
enhance
them
either
definitely
worth
a
look
o
good
would
have
liked
more
complexity
and
more
flavor
in
general
not
something
ill
come
back
to
in
a
hurry
but
not
something
id
turn
down
either
probably
very
dangerous
super
drinkable
per
its
abv
othis
calls
for
more
fruit
notes
since
high
alcohol
looking
forward
to
how
it
is
in
five
years
hops
would
have
done
this
good
as
well
not
a
bad
brew
just
overly
sweet
overall
one
the
best
balanced
smooth
and
easy
drinking
barleywines
ive
ever
had
o
good
english
barleywine
not
real
complex
but
has
nice
sweet
taste
and
dark
fruit
notes
that
complement
each
other
well
right
now
this
beer
seems
like
a
sweet
mess
but
it
has
more
potential
than
any
beer
i
have
tasted
obviously
it
is
nothing
compared
to
its
barrel
aged
cousin
but
an
enjoyable
sipper
nonetheless
what
throws
me
though
is
the
belgianness
of
the
beer
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
tripel
or
quadruple
than
a
barleywine
i
love
insanity
that
much
better
and
idiots
drool
even
more
so
weyerbacher
rocks
most
people
cannot
handle
the
abv
but
i
can
and
enjoy
all
their
brews
overall
its
a
mostly
unoffensive
barleywine
but
is
far
too
onedimensional
reminds
me
of
brooklyns
monster
there
are
better
beers
out
there
o
a
nice
barleywine
nothing
wild
or
crazy
just
a
very
solid
traditional
barleywine
not
much
of
a
barleywine
drinker
but
i
am
glad
i
bought
a
4
pack
of
this
beer
and
will
enjoy
it
next
time
i
have
one
o
low
complexity
but
the
flavors
are
true
quite
drinkable
and
glad
i
tried
it
wouldnt
mind
having
another
age
might
help
this
one
i
might
cellar
one
for
a
year
and
see
what
that
yields
overall
a
nice
barleywine
i
can
check
off
as
good
nicely
impressed
by
this
beer
and
it
was
still
good
for
till
sometime
in
2016
could
only
imagine
how
an
older
one
would
taste
as
most
barleywines
they
get
better
with
age
alcohol
will
most
likely
be
more
well
hidden
as
the
beer
gets
older
one
thin
finger
of
light
tan
froth
top
a
muddy
brown
body
not
a
lot
of
duration
and
lacing
not
surprisingly
for
the
style
subtle
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
some
rumsoaked
cherries
good
taste
a
bit
boozy
loaded
with
boozy
cherries
berry
and
hazelnut
smooth
easygoing
despite
the
11
abv
blithering
idiot
is
a
nice
representative
of
the
style
which
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
i
certainly
prefer
the
more
hoppedup
versions
especially
in
american
barleywines
this
however
is
pretty
good
and
worth
a
try
not
bad
but
nothing
spectacular
easy
drinking
for
an
11
abv
so
yeah
a
few
of
these
would
make
you
a
blithering
idiot
overall
this
beer
took
a
little
time
to
grow
on
me
it
helped
when
the
beer
warmed
more
poured
into
a
tulip
deep
reddish
caramel
color
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
smell
sweet
of
cherries
and
burned
sugar
and
caramel
faint
alcohol
on
the
nose
as
well
taste
doesnt
have
much
up
front
but
hits
sweet
and
balanced
on
the
finish
has
a
very
faint
metallic
offtaste
that
ive
picked
up
in
some
of
my
homebrews
but
barely
there
pretty
good
but
not
as
robust
as
id
expect
from
a
big
barleywine
the
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
pretty
drinkable
but
again
thats
not
what
i
really
expect
from
an
11
1
barleywine
drink
and
overall
ahh
its
drinkable
its
a
solid
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
another
six
pack
honestly
this
is
a
better
brew
when
its
matured
drink
it
young
and
its
not
so
swell
let
this
age
a
few
years
and
it
pays
off
very
good
when
its
properly
matured
a
few
years
when
its
consumed
shortly
after
bottling
its
rather
mediocre
and
unbalanced
overall
if
i
had
this
close
to
me
id
probably
pick
some
up
regurarly
not
what
i
expected
for
a
barelywine
i
havent
had
many
but
i
would
not
say
i
would
have
this
for
a
first
experience
one
to
sip
on
considering
the
higher
abv
maybe
one
i
would
start
with
and
migrate
from
quickly
during
an
evening
out
but
good
none
the
less
overall
i
enjoyed
this
ale
quite
a
bit
there
are
not
very
many
barleywines
that
my
girlfriend
likes
but
this
one
makes
her
list
of
likes
as
well
as
mine
810
ok
not
must
have
o
as
much
as
i
love
weyerbacher
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
and
am
still
slightly
underwhelmed
by
it
insanity
on
the
other
hand
is
an
amazing
beer
this
one
is
a
nice
go
to
barleywine
that
i
can
find
anytime
like
it
have
had
better
o
a
fairly
good
barleywine
that
is
tasty
and
easy
enough
to
drink
though
it
lacks
depth
and
complexity
intensity
and
could
use
a
little
more
sweetness
for
the
style
a
little
too
much
carbonation
too
not
bad
again
1
year
later
big
ass
booze
died
down
a
bit
just
pummeled
blackass
overripe
fruit
o
lots
of
strong
flavors
are
present
in
this
beer
but
they
are
drowned
out
by
the
burn
of
alcohol
which
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
throat
as
the
bros
warned
this
beer
needs
to
sit
and
age
until
the
alcohol
mellows
o
very
yummy
beer
quite
drinkable
for
the
11
1
i
would
buy
this
again
for
sure
i
dont
understand
the
low
ratings
here
its
a
perfectly
acceptable
strong
barleywinestyle
albeit
not
refined
meh
o
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
a
real
sipper
at
11
1
although
the
alcohol
isnt
as
overwhelming
as
the
percent
would
dictate
pours
a
deep
amber
color
w
a
nice
one
finger
cocoa
head
good
carbonation
and
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
somewhat
cloudy
in
appearance
as
well
nose
is
a
little
underwhelming
to
me
some
cherry
fig
alcohol
sweetness
very
understated
and
not
as
aromatic
as
id
like
definitely
not
up
to
the
best
for
this
style
taste
is
smooth
but
same
as
the
nose
im
just
not
feeling
this
beer
and
i
really
like
most
of
this
breweries
offerings
it
just
doesnt
have
the
punch
character
or
complexity
as
a
good
english
barleywine
has
feel
is
alright
sweet
and
somewhat
light
and
syrupy
a
fairly
simplistic
feel
for
this
style
overall
this
is
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
weyerbacher
makes
some
great
brews
overall
unfortunately
this
one
is
slightly
better
than
mediocre
for
the
style
not
to
bad
overall
id
like
to
try
one
with
a
few
years
on
it
for
sure
the
low
rating
is
probably
based
on
fresh
tastings
and
it
should
be
aged
a
bit
o
this
is
a
great
barleywine
not
sure
what
people
are
crying
about
who
give
it
bs
and
cs
ive
had
barleywines
far
worse
than
this
one
the
taste
is
a
full
malty
blend
of
toasted
caramel
and
is
augmented
by
some
slight
creamy
tinges
which
are
accented
by
a
slight
cinnnamonlike
woodiness
which
transitions
to
an
alcohol
flavor
which
brings
a
warmth
and
dryness
on
the
throat
carries
on
to
the
belly
with
some
subtle
toffee
that
lingers
after
the
swallow
there
is
a
mild
pine
that
emerges
as
it
ners
cellar
temp
with
the
fusel
in
the
tertiary
taste
overall
mot
a
great
barleywine
but
better
than
some
in
the
style
i
give
thos
props
fo
the
aroma
and
taste
but
there
is
more
fusel
alcohol
in
this
than
i
prefer
for
my
personal
taste
d
not
awful
by
any
means
but
the
high
alcohol
is
probably
the
culprit
here
in
the
negative
points
the
flavors
head
and
body
are
muted
in
favor
of
pure
diesel
power
however
would
definitely
be
a
good
stepping
stone
beer
to
get
into
more
complex
brews
as
a
beginner
ooverall
i
had
my
questions
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
good
interpretation
of
the
style
good
beer
the
taste
itself
is
much
much
more
bland
where
did
those
flavors
go
that
came
through
in
the
nose
its
not
bad
its
even
somewhat
smooth
but
the
flavor
just
isnt
there
i
wont
drain
pour
the
rest
of
this
but
im
not
dying
to
take
more
sips
i
think
its
about
time
to
break
out
the
rum
and
make
some
hurricanes
drinkability
an
alright
english
barleywine
although
the
flavor
profile
seems
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
it
starts
off
on
a
good
not
but
the
dark
fruit
fizzle
into
a
generically
sweet
finish
worth
purchasing
a
bottle
to
try
i
enjoyed
it
the
mouth
is
definitely
the
best
part
packing
a
silky
smooth
texture
time
has
obviously
taken
away
some
of
the
offending
elements
but
it
still
feels
incomplete
and
i
think
a
few
more
years
wouldnt
hurt
it
definitely
has
its
moments
but
compared
to
abacus
and
gratitude
its
underdeveloped
its
not
nearly
as
good
as
insanity
and
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
although
if
youre
a
diehard
barleywine
fan
youll
probably
like
this
one
overall
a
decent
english
bw
but
insanity
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
was
so
much
better
it
almost
tastes
like
a
completely
different
beer
i
would
definatly
recommend
insanity
over
this
maybe
this
would
fare
a
little
better
with
some
age
overall
big
boisterous
yet
smooth
barleywine
just
a
tad
over
the
top
despite
the
big
taste
profile
sip
this
and
enjoy
the
complexities
with
about
1
5
years
on
it
blithering
idiot
is
a
much
better
beer
the
alcohol
content
is
still
formidable
but
the
sweetness
is
tempered
allowing
the
wonderful
maltiness
of
this
brew
to
shine
through
huge
notes
of
toffee
dates
and
bourbon
even
though
this
stuff
aint
barrelaged
definitely
let
this
one
sit
for
a
while
before
drinking
upping
this
to
a
b
from
a
c
cheers
overall
not
a
bad
barleywine
very
enjoyable
and
balanced
this
is
just
a
great
beer
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
how
good
this
beer
is
from
the
reviews
that
i
had
read
i
love
it
though
at
12
for
a
four
pack
i
think
this
is
a
real
good
deal
odef
a
good
beer
for
colder
weather
has
a
nice
warming
touch
at
the
end
which
it
welcome
when
the
temps
drop
overall
this
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
a
disaster
but
this
turned
out
alright
certainly
not
the
best
ive
had
though
overall
really
sweet
and
smooth
this
one
is
for
sure
occasional
drink
as
its
just
too
sweet
you
would
become
a
blithering
idiot
of
not
careful
from
its
11
alcohol
and
as
easy
it
is
to
drink
would
like
to
try
this
one
age
a
few
years
to
maybe
lesson
the
sugars
overall
this
was
a
very
soilid
beer
easily
one
that
should
be
sought
out
as
it
was
readily
available
and
somewhat
affordable
i
would
have
no
issue
in
trying
this
one
again
any
day
o
a
really
well
built
english
bw
very
available
and
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
drink
this
daily
you
can
definately
get
where
insanity
gets
its
backbone
from
before
the
barrel
aging
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
with
a
few
years
on
it
the
tastes
begin
with
the
sweet
caramel
malts
again
and
sweet
fruitiness
dates
figs
orange
and
lesser
plums
as
it
opens
up
more
you
get
a
great
deal
of
toffee
and
complex
maltiness
lesser
brown
sugar
notes
slight
earthy
maybe
a
little
citrus
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
but
it
stays
true
to
its
english
style
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
adequate
carbonation
more
carbonation
than
most
which
makes
the
abv
less
detectable
and
raises
the
drinkability
for
me
overall
a
great
english
barleywine
and
remains
underappreciated
in
my
opinion
weyerbacher
continues
to
deliver
great
beer
after
great
beer
the
only
negative
being
its
english
is
hardly
no
hop
bitterness
but
its
forgiven
since
the
alcohol
is
well
concealed
a
very
nice
beer
cheers
jh
m
medium
bodied
but
sticky
going
down
slightly
drying
at
the
end
the
alcohol
provides
just
a
little
hint
of
bite
if
you
take
a
big
sip
overall
this
is
quite
a
tasty
barleywine
im
looking
forward
to
the
insanity
i
have
in
the
fridge
o
ok
but
a
little
too
rich
and
sweet
for
me
lingering
caramelly
malt
flavors
are
just
over
the
top
drinkability
is
similarly
just
okay
good
i
guess
for
the
gravity
but
i
feel
like
id
need
to
revisit
it
when
the
bottle
has
more
age
just
to
see
if
anything
more
can
be
pulled
out
of
it
i
would
lean
towards
saying
no
the
main
flaw
mouthfeel
cant
really
be
corrected
with
age
nose
is
loaded
with
sweet
toffee
and
bready
malt
real
boquet
of
floral
esters
taste
offers
a
sweet
bread
malt
toffee
dark
fruits
strong
ethanol
in
the
finish
bordering
on
solvent
brown
sugar
raisins
bit
of
earth
some
dryness
in
the
finish
proper
flavors
but
the
booze
is
overbearing
especially
considering
the
body
is
a
little
thin
for
the
abv
nice
smooth
carb
decent
beer
but
simply
too
boozy
and
solventy
for
any
more
than
a
bottle
overall
slightly
different
than
the
past
blitherings
ive
had
from
this
past
year
biggest
difference
was
the
yeast
in
suspension
and
the
slightly
cloying
flavors
d
not
my
favorite
barleywine
not
much
sweetness
to
it
the
complexity
was
there
but
not
the
good
kind
go
get
old
horizontal
or
bigfoot
o
decent
but
very
alcoholic
barleywine
3
5
pours
a
deep
reddish
orange
with
a
big
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
and
laces
itself
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
is
very
raisiny
very
deep
fig
like
dark
fruit
indeed
nice
sugary
malts
with
a
spicy
kick
to
it
big
hot
alcohol
plums
can
be
found
when
smelling
around
the
glass
also
pale
sugary
malt
taste
fills
the
mouth
alcohol
sting
sweet
hops
alcohol
little
chocolates
and
other
dark
sweets
can
be
found
this
is
medium
to
full
bodied
sugary
candy
blast
it
leaves
the
mouth
dry
with
a
lot
of
resin
on
the
tongue
and
teeth
i
had
alot
of
problems
with
the
feel
of
this
beer
it
was
very
creamy
but
also
seemed
to
be
almost
flat
at
times
not
very
enjoyable
and
killed
the
experience
of
the
beer
for
me
this
beer
has
alot
of
issues
that
i
dont
think
ill
try
again
to
see
if
they
figured
it
out
i
picked
this
bottle
up
in
florida
a
couple
weeks
ago
it
pours
a
medium
bodied
cloudy
dark
orange
on
the
verge
of
amber
it
looks
kind
of
thick
and
syrupy
it
smells
of
some
serious
sweet
carmel
malts
pale
malts
and
seriously
faded
hops
its
a
let
down
from
that
perspective
for
a
barleywine
this
sure
hasnt
held
up
well
even
over
the
past
five
or
six
months
it
tastes
of
pale
malts
syrup
brown
sugar
carmel
malts
and
honey
it
is
a
malt
bomb
there
is
zero
hop
presence
it
drinks
pretty
syrupy
and
is
overly
sweet
and
leaves
the
sweetness
behind
in
the
aftertaste
booo
this
beer
is
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
its
just
malty
syrup
drainpour
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
smelling
with
some
piney
hops
in
the
mix
the
flavors
are
there
but
not
in
the
biggest
way
its
a
bit
watery
on
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
could
be
a
lot
better
i
know
a
lot
of
people
who
love
this
beer
for
its
strength
whenever
i
talk
to
people
about
strong
beers
they
ask
me
about
this
one
its
a
decent
barley
wine
but
its
not
the
greatest
i
think
people
from
around
here
like
it
so
much
because
its
local
and
that
cool
to
show
support
for
the
home
team
just
after
i
finish
the
beer
i
stand
up
too
quickly
and
i
get
light
headed
i
have
become
the
idiot
overall
a
bit
strong
im
gonna
cellar
the
rest
to
see
if
the
heat
dies
down
and
the
flavors
blend
a
bit
better
delicious
but
dont
expect
to
down
a
6pk
by
yourself
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
dark
copper
body
and
very
little
head
to
it
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
little
fruit
hops
coming
threw
the
taste
is
like
medicine
and
bubble
gum
flavored
with
a
hint
of
barley
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
hard
and
not
smooth
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
overall
how
is
this
terrible
beer
the
base
beer
for
weyerbachers
infinitely
better
insanity
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
very
unpleasant
musky
and
old
tasting
beer
wheat
and
fruit
domiinate
the
taste
but
are
combined
poorly
overall
a
very
dissapointing
barleywine
d
very
tasty
4
pack
gone
d
this
is
good
and
shows
very
little
alcohol
d
i
have
poured
this
beer
out
trash
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
a
bit
below
average
drinkability
was
not
bad
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
not
an
outstanding
beer
of
the
style
but
a
good
one
at
the
least
overall
a
fantastic
barleywine
ale
with
an
abundance
of
flavor
that
does
an
awesome
job
of
concealing
the
high
alcohol
content
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
drinker
sipper
if
you
will
and
a
strong
ass
beer
a
little
misrepresented
style
wise
but
every
brewery
has
a
different
scope
of
view
i
had
no
problem
with
my
12oz
deep
and
cloudy
amber
hue
with
a
quickly
diminishing
head
leaving
a
little
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
nothing
huge
bursts
out
of
me
with
the
smell
but
i
can
smell
some
dried
fruit
and
alcohol
big
inviting
creamy
mouthfeel
that
balances
out
some
of
the
alcohol
taste
which
is
strong
but
not
as
overbearing
as
some
11
percent
beers
ive
had
alcohol
tends
to
linger
on
the
back
of
the
throat
though
and
may
deter
some
i
would
drink
another
one
but
not
too
many
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
6
pack
of
it
though
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
good
white
head
starts
out
with
two
fingers
and
fades
down
into
a
moderatelysized
collar
with
some
film
on
top
the
nose
is
fairly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruits
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
coming
through
along
with
some
cherries
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
caramel
a
bit
of
yeastiness
comes
through
as
well
difficult
to
pin
down
the
yeast
reminds
me
of
harpoons
house
ale
yeast
drinks
pretty
well
though
theres
nothing
too
noteworthy
about
it
i
dont
get
much
other
than
the
yeast
though
that
portion
is
distinctively
american
d
alcohol
is
fairly
noticeable
a
good
sipping
beer
pours
a
nice
looking
medium
to
deep
copper
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
aroma
is
of
dried
fruits
some
caramel
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
fruity
more
malty
than
hoppy
some
alcohol
is
definitely
present
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
thick
sweet
and
a
bit
sticky
carbonation
is
low
but
adequate
not
my
favorite
barleywine
definitely
could
benefit
from
a
bit
of
hop
presence
considerably
warm
and
fuzzy
the
alcohol
seems
to
come
out
a
lot
in
this
one
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
slight
bitterness
makes
this
a
decent
tasting
and
drinkable
beer
however
the
burn
seems
to
catch
up
with
you
hindering
the
experience
md
the
alcohol
content
on
this
one
is
everpresent
and
you
are
reminded
of
it
on
every
exhale
i
for
one
kinda
like
this
as
its
also
relatively
low
on
bitter
hops
the
carbonation
is
slight
making
it
easy
to
drink
its
a
very
dangerous
beer
as
its
so
tasty
without
bitterness
you
could
easily
wind
up
the
buffoon
pictured
on
the
bottle
a
blithering
idiot
d
considering
its
strength
this
beer
is
not
that
difficult
to
drink
although
theres
no
way
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
d
its
not
horrible
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
d
jesus
this
was
bad
i
have
no
desire
to
try
this
again
often
this
is
pretty
decent
like
most
in
the
style
its
best
relatively
warmer
a
little
confusionclashing
of
flavors
andor
sensations
but
this
is
a
mostly
flavorful
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
needs
a
little
refining
or
age
though
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
barley
wine
worth
a
try
i
am
also
aging
one
bottle
hoping
that
it
gets
even
better
with
time
dm
a
bit
intense
at
first
complexity
is
very
nice
slight
alcohol
burn
is
not
overwhelming
little
to
no
carbonation
tingle
sits
smooth
on
the
palate
and
suprisingly
light
in
the
stomach
this
beer
poured
a
ruby
like
amber
color
that
was
very
hazy
and
small
amounts
of
head
typical
of
a
barleywine
there
was
a
strong
alchool
smell
the
taste
was
similar
to
a
red
wine
a
strong
grape
like
flavor
a
good
but
not
overpowering
kick
from
the
alchool
nicely
carbonated
overall
a
good
beer
not
the
best
barleywine
but
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
rated
a
bit
lower
because
of
the
strong
abv
is
good
nonetheless
and
would
have
again
12
oz

long
bittersweet
finish
i
enjoyed
this
brew
a
lot
by
the
fireplace
not
sure
if
my
palate
has
drastically
changed
or
if
the
beer
has
but
what
im
drinking
now
is
nowhere
near
as
good
as
what
i
noted
in
the
above
review
hugely
malty
boozy
and
not
too
complex
not
doing
much
for
me
at
all
a
shell
of
the
beer
those
comments
described
this
one
simultaneously
begs
me
to
sip
it
slower
and
drink
it
faster
one
of
the
better
beers
in
its
style
that
ive
tried
i
think
its
scores
are
a
bit
lower
because
its
not
an
american
hopmonster
barleywine
dont
buy
it
if
youre
looking
for
another
bigfoot
or
old
guardian
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
malty
englishstyle
barleywine
this
one
might
suit
you
well
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
a
good
solid
english
barleywine
flavorful
and
warming
for
some
reason
i
remember
hearing
nothing
but
good
things
about
this
beer
honestly
im
a
bit
disappointed
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
tongue
punch
but
i
just
get
a
super
sweet
malt
bomb
where
are
the
hops
d
very
drinkable
but
if
you
are
able
to
store
and
save
for
a
year
its
very
much
worth
the
time
and
wait
but
awesome
drinker
as
you
buy
it
as
well
ill
finish
the
12
oz
bottle
but
it
misses
the
mark
on
many
notes
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
hard
to
kick
back
on
a
winter
night
tasting
your
wifes
nail
polish
remover
d
drinkable
barleywine
without
a
doubt
no
real
alcohol
presence
at
all
in
this
one
not
an
overly
complex
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
but
a
very
solid
offering
nonetheless
drink
ability
is
okay
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
this
is
another
sipper
though
with
a
medium
body
it
isnt
too
filling
an
adequate
beer
this
would
have
fit
my
preferred
style
back
when
i
first
started
drinking
craft
beer
it
is
a
pretty
simple
beer
sweet
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
load
of
alcohol
that
is
well
hidden
d
not
my
style
exactly
but
its
not
terrible
i
suppose
its
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
but
thats
not
saying
too
much
d
its
a
big
beer
and
its
not
afraid
to
let
you
know
it
the
alcohol
will
definitely
slow
you
down
d
excellent
to
sip
wasnt
difficult
to
finish
by
myself
in
two
six
ounce
pours
would
be
excellent
to
share
with
another
absolutely
going
to
be
one
of
my
annual
pick
ups
one
pack
to
drink
one
to
age
drinkability
its
not
bad
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
its
not
likely
something
ill
seek
out
again
in
the
near
future
the
smell
and
flavors
are
solid
enough
but
the
body
hurts
it
and
the
high
abv
prevents
more
than
one
being
put
down
in
a
night
worth
trying
not
sure
if
i
would
actually
pick
this
up
to
age
as
the
body
isnt
likely
to
improve
d
not
bad
and
definitely
drinkable
for
the
abv
just
nothing
special
overall
not
very
impressive
however
if
i
just
wanted
to
get
messed
up
not
a
bad
call
as
easy
to
drink
d
it
is
a
strong
zipper
but
its
a
damn
tasty
one
very
little
alcohol
makes
this
amazingly
easy
to
drink
and
the
flavors
are
awesome
very
tasty
barelywine
d
pretty
low
its
damn
boozy
malty
and
sweet
this
brew
has
a
great
taste
it
does
down
pretty
well
but
is
a
very
filling
brew
it
also
has
a
nice
punch
as
well
a
wonderful
representation
of
the
style
but
a
person
who
doesnt
drink
barleywines
very
often
might
have
a
hard
time
with
this
brew
i
enjoyed
it
to
the
very
end
i
am
also
glad
i
purchased
a
4
pack
so
i
can
enjoy
the
rest
poured
from
bottle
into

mini

the
style
usually
gets
but
i
found
it
helped
the
finish
be
a
bit
cleaner
rather
then
sweet
and
sticky
drinkability
is
good
not
my
favorite
barleywine
but
a
decent
example
of
the
style
a
very
drinkable
high
alcohol
content
barley
wine
that
i
was
content
with
drinking
im
no
expert
on
the
physics
involved
with
deciphering
specific
ingredients
but
for
an
11er
it
was
damn
good
with
a
grapey
flavor
to
it
almost
reminded
me
of
a
belgian
style
ale
minus
the
bavarian
yeast
and
booziness
the
best
ive
had
thus
far
from
this
brewing
company
not
a
big
fan
of
barley
wines
but
highly
recommend
trying
one
of
these
bad
boys
d
im
not
a
big
weyerbacher
fan
however
this
one
really
works
for
me
i
dont
taste
any
alcohol
in
it
and
find
it
gulpable
especially
for
a
barleywine
ill
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
say
its

best
beer

to

also

overall
wow
i
really
like
this
the
malty
flavor
really
sticks
out
and
is
not
discuised
by
a
hop
bomb
like
other
barleywines
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
amber
brownish
color
with
a
quarterinch
head
no
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
like
dried
fruit
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
interesting
starts
off
with
brown
sugar
figs
dried
fruit
and
becomes
a
sort
of
musty
taste
for
lack
of
a
better
word
alot
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
overall
not
a
bad
barleywine
its
not
my
favorite
but
its
certainly
not
a
bad
example
of
one
well
its
been
a
few
months
since
ive
posted
a
review
and
figured
its
time
to
get
off
my
ass
and
put
down
a
few
meaningful
words
hopefully
the
end
result
being
that
someone
will
take
my
advice
i
am
very
familiar
with
blithering
idiot
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
i
hadnt
yet
reviewed
it
i
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
straight
from
the
fridge
into
my
tasting
snifter
right
off
i
can
tell
i
should
have
let
it
set
on
the
counter
to
warm
a
bit
a
cold
beer
will
never
release
the
aroma
youre
looking
for
when
first
poured
the
color
is
almost
a
dark
rusty
orange
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
glass
of
apple
cider
the
small
opaque
head
disappears
almost
as
soon
as
the
entire
beer
is
poured
the
aroma
is
a
reminiscent
or
other
barleywine
ive
had
in
the
past
its
got
a
heavy
does
of
hops
and
fruit
along
with
a
little
citrus
the
taste
is
awesome
not
too
hot
and
not
overly
boozy
there
is
a
pleasant
after
taste
but
it
is
dismissed
largely
due
to
the
cigarette
that
im
enjoying
as
well
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
brewery
in
my
home
state
of
pennsylvania
one
of
these
days
im
going
to
have
to
take
the
long
haul
out
to
the
weyerbacher
brewery
in
easton
and
get
a
fresh
growler
full
cheers
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
easy
drinking
barleywine
that
is
tasty
enough
to
be
worth
drinking
again
i
wouldnt
make
a
huge
effort
to
track
it
down
but
id
be
pleased
to
have
a
bottle
of
this
again
some
time
d
as
drinkable
as
11
1
beer
can
be
im
at
home
and
im
not
going
anywhere
its
obviously
a
big
beer
and
this
big
guy
likes
it
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
prefer
the
super
hoppy
american
barleywines
but
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
was
expecting
cider
sweet
with
overpowering
alcohol
what
i
got
was
sooo
much
more
this
poured
a
nice
amber
color
typical
of
an
ale
with
a
thin
head
up
front
which
soon
dissipated
as
should
be
expected
the
aroma
was
bursting
almost
like
a
well
placed
bouquet
the
flavor
is
what
floored
me
for
as
strong
as
this
is
there
was
no
doubt
that
first
and
foremost
this
is
an
ale
wonderful
flavor
and
the
very
strong
alcohol
doesnt
make
its
presence
known
until
you
have
swallowed
this
reminds
me
of
drinking
scotch
not
in
the
taste
but
in
the
effect
well
done
weyerbacher
i
only
hope
my
favorite
store
continues
to
stock
your
product
drinkability
a
predominately
sweet
malty
barleywine
that
i
enjoyed
fairly
well
i
have
a
few
older
bottles
lurking
the
cellar
that
ill
be
sure
to
check
on
the
apricot
colored
body
of
this
beer
was
slightly
hazy
and
was
topped
with
a
very
small
head
the
smell
was
fruity
and
bready
with
a
nice
layering
revealing
nuances
depending
on
how
deeply
the
vapor
was
inhaled
the
taste
was
quite
sweet
with
figs
and
cherries
coming
to
mind
immediately
the
amount
of
sugar
here
was
quite
high
and
would
have
been
cloying
but
for
the
mouth
drying
effects
of
the
otherwise
well
hidden
alcohol
richly
drizzled
mouthfeel
was
the
highlight
of
the
session
unashamedly
english
in
its
approach
and
should
cellar
very
well
prosit
mk
nice
caramel
color
and
flavor
with
white
lacing
worth
trying
but
ill
only
have
1
this
evening
bless
weyerbacher
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
easy
to
drink
despite
the
high
abv
overall
this
is
a
sweet
beer
with
big
alchohol
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
malt
with
dark
fruits
spice
and
alcohol
the
taste
starts
out
sweet
and
malty
with
dark
fruits
and
a
long
warming
finish
from
the
high
abv
as
sweet
as
this
beer
is
from
all
the
malt
i
feel
that
it
could
use
some
more
hops
to
help
balance
things
out
i
find
that
the
high
abv
and
the
cloying
taste
limits
the
drinkability
quite
a
bit
worth
a
shot
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
blithering
idiot
and
would
not
likely
purchase
again
this
one
definitely
needs
a
couple
years
of
aging
to
mellow
out
a
bit
d
this
one
will
kick
your
ass
if
you
try
to
drink
3
this
is
just
a
sipping
beer
and
not
to
be
guzzled
but
meant
to
be
enjoyed
d
at
11
one
is
my
limit
on
this
one
but
a
very
nice
barleywine
d
this
is
a
sipper
and
not
something
i
want
a
lot
of
in
one
night
but
id
buy
it
again
and
share
this
one
was
smooth
going
down
and
easy
drinking
but
at
11
abv
too
strong
for
an
immediate
second
definitely
worth
returning
to
another
time
overall
impression
nicely
done
this
reminds
me
of
a
poor
mans
thomas
hardy
lovely
balance
of
malt
and
alcohol
its
dangerously
hidden
this
would
make
for
a
great
reduction
sauce
to
put
over
some
freerange
duck
probably
not
the
best
choice
for
a
memorial
day
cookout
but
i
could
see
sipping
this
by
the
fireside
in
about
5
months
nice
job
here
pours
a
nice
looking
medium
to
deep
copper
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
aroma
is
of
dried
fruits
some
caramel
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
sweet
fruity
more
malty
than
hoppy
some
alcohol
is
definitely
present
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
thick
sweet
and
a
bit
sticky
carbonation
is
low
but
adequate
not
my
favorite
barleywine
definitely
could
benefit
from
a
bit
of
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
syrupy
carbonation
is
light
and
adds
some
interest
keeping
the
feel
from
being
too
sticky
not
what
i
would
call
drinkable
but
its
an
enjoyable
single
bottle
the
oak
aged
version
insanity
is
a
completely
different
animal
pours
a
nice
burgundy
color
with
a
little
head
to
begin
with
but
then
none
some
lacing
in
strings
now
and
then
the
aroma
isnt
the
least
bit
shy
nor
the
alcohol
which
seems
to
seep
into
everything
there
are
figs
and
raisins
and
plums
here
as
with
the
taste
and
some
faint
toffee
the
mouth
is
kinda
hot
not
exactly
smooth
but
good
enough
almost
puckers
up
from
bittering
toward
the
end
and
a
dry
finish
pretty
good
english
style
barley
wine
i
must
say
i
can
appreciate
this
beer
its
actually
pretty
good
but
in
the
end
i
just
dont
exactly
like
it
this
one
could
use
some
time
in
the
cellar
but
i
dont
know
how
much
that
will
help
its
a
popular
beer
but
i
just
cant
get
behind
this
one
try
it
for
yourself
and
see
what
you
find
d
heftier
abv
again
as
per
the
norm
might
become
a
bit
heavy
almost
even
cloying
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
one
at
a
time
for
me
id
say
d
real
easy
to
drink
not
as
hoppy
as
most
american
barleywines
which
i
really
enjoy
definitely
a
good
one
to
sip
pretty
good
and
my
favorite
weyerbacher
offering
so
far
a
much
better
beer
ontap
than
in
the
bottle
smooth
and
oily
texture
broken
up
and
made
more
palatable
by
a
fine
tingle
of
carbonation
abv
limits
how
many
of
these
one
can
drink
but
the
character
of
the
brew
is
neither
heavy
nor
over
the
top
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
not
at
all
bad
an
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
less
of
a
hop
kick
than
an
american
barleywine
but
some
interesting
flavors
nevertheless
this
poured
a
hazy
brown
with
very
little
head
it
smelled
of
malt
and
fall
spices
like
pumpkin
with
a
bit
of
hops
it
had
a
spicy
malt
flavor
with
a
heavy
taste
like
a
brown
ale
it
wasnt
very
bitter
and
the
aftertaste
was
smooth
making
the
beer
easy
to
drink
the
texture
was
nice
too
but
not
very
carbonated
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
drink
but
nothing
unique
for
a
barleywine
almost
too
easy
to
drink
but
one
is
enough
since
the
abv
does
sneak
up
on
you
this
one
typifies
the
weyerbacher
attempts
at
attacking
beers
you
get
what
you
come
for
i
picked
up
several
smells
taking
a
whiff
including
caramel
cinnamon
honey
something
like
liquor
bourbon
pepper
and
some
mild
citric
notes
a
great
tasting
beer
that
was
a
little
spicy
yet
also
sugary
and
went
down
very
smooth
bubblegum
and
honey
are
in
the
taste
but
caramel
came
through
the
most
in
this
fullbodied
brew
and
maybe
thats
why
this
beer
has
a
little
stickiness
to
it
though
the
abv
is
hidden
well
still
a
sipping
beer
because
of
the
sweetness
and
with
those
two
reasons
i
could
see
having
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
i
couldnt
have
a
couple
in
one
sitting
pours
a
light
transluscent
amber
color
with
a
moderatly
lasting
beige
head
smell
is
light
and
fruity
with
notes
of
peaches
apricot
and
lemon
taste
is
a
tingly
prickly
sweet
and
mainly
alcoholic
flavor
much
like
vodka
light
bodied
for
the
style
i
thought
and
definitely
a
bit
hotter
and
thinner
flavored
than
i
like
my
barley
wines
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
full
bodied
definitely
a
sipping
beer
carbonation
is
good
its
definitely
strong
at
11
1
it
goes
down
easy
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
personally
overall
this
is
a
pretty
impressive
barleywine
weyerbacher
never
seems
to
dissapoint
me
aggressive
as
always
i
posted
a
2
0
for
the
appearance
because
its
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
and
gives
one
alot
of
sedement
ugh
d
this
is
dangerous
this
is
a
real
treat
tons
of
personality
and
some
serious
kick
it
obviously
has
earned
its
name
this
is
a
sipper
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
high
abv
will
get
you
this
is
one
to
end
the
evening
with
drinkability
this
is
quite
complex
but
not
as
overthetop
as
some
barleywines
it
finishes
relatively
smooth
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
a
couple
of
and
relax
with
but
i
would
to
drink
too
much
more
than
that
in
one
night
barley
wine
style
definitely
blithering
idiot
is
deceptive
in
that
it
is
quite
sweet
in
both
nose
and
mouth
and
manages
to
hide
that
serious
kick
with
the
exception
of
some
enjoyable
warming
at
the
end
awesome
and
that
color
almost
like
a
ruby
colored
port
so
long
as
you
arent
put
off
by
the
sweet
profile
you
will
probably
like
this
recommended
this
is
not
bad
but
it
is
not
great
i
wish
i
had
aged
this
longer
than
six
months
but
it
is
cold
outside
and
thought
this
would
be
a
good
treat
this
would
be
a
good
treat
if
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
more
subtle
certainly
nor
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
make
a
great
effort
to
find
big
bodied
and
noticeably
viscous
lightly
carbonated
this
beer
is
a
nice
sipper
for
a
cold
windy
winter
night
its
not
7pm
yet
and
surely
this
will
be
my
nightcap
today
d
notes
a
good
sipping
smooth
barley
wine
it
is
probably
overly
sweet
and
would
improve
with
age
but
i
had
no
problem
drinking
it
fresh
d
a
good
drinkable
american
made
barley
wine
not
outstanding
but
definitely
something
i
will
try
again
d
very
good
i
enjoyed
this
beer
if
you
buy
six
of
these
i
would
recommend
inviting
five
friends
over
to
help
out
d
very
tasty
and
not
a
bad
b
w
but
rough
around
the
edges
and
the
alcohol
is
too
present
i
have
to
say
its
average
overall
a
couple
of
these
really
will
make
you
a
blithering
idiot
as
a
final
note
and
not
to
bash
this
creation
of
weyerbacher
in
any
way
but
all
i
can
think
of
when
drinking
this
is
that
its
like
an
american
macro
on
steroids
as
like
many
weyerbacher
brews
this
was
overthetop
very
eccentric
and
really
a
sipper
the
hefty
11
1
abv
must
be
treated
with
caution
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
without
a
doubt
appearance
was
appealing
rubyred
copper
appearance
with
minimal
frothy
head
smell
was
thick
with
strong
nutty
toffe
aroma
very
very
rich
thick
creamy
toffee
caramel
brown
sugar
taste
that
is
really
strong
and
powerful
this
brew
is
certainly
one
to
be
reckoned
with
malty
full
of
dark
brown
belgian
sugars
and
creamy
flavors
a
dominating
and
powerful
brew
that
you
have
to
take
easily
interesting
brew
worth
a
try
and
typical
of
many
weyerbacher
samples
reddish
copper
in
color
impressive
head
with
incredible
retention
and
massive
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
pub
glass
the
ontap
version
seems
to
be
much
better
than
the
the
bottled
version
aroma
is
typical
of
a
barley
wine
woody
musky
and
kind
of
citrusy
taste
is
perfect
i
would
not
change
a
thing
plenty
of
barley
and
a
nice
hopyeast
balance
you
must
try
this
one
i
can
feel
the
warmth
of
this
beer
unfortunately
this
decreases
the
drinkability
as
i
can
make
out
the
alcohol
and
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
complete
even
the
12oz
bottle
the
barrel
aged
version
is
much
better
as
it
adds
a
few
levels
of
complexity
that
masks
the
heat
d
i
will
buy
this
again
or
try
it
again
as
i
did
enjoy
it
but
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
else
i
would
become
a
blithering
idiot

i
put
a
bottle
of
this

away
to
let
it

up
a

well
worth
a
try
pours
a
fully
clouded
brown
that
has
orangered

nose
is
definitely
fruitlike
minor
cherries
mostly
flavor
is
influenced
by
alcohol
i
can
tell
that
right
off
the
bat
but
it
does
stay
mild
enough
so
as
to
not
ruin
the
whole
thing
mild
fruity
edge
mild
raisins
on
the
end
as
it
warms
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
definitely
full
bodied
feel
is
typical
this
is
very
drinkable
since
it
is
so
smooth
but
like
i
said
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
at
this
point
murky

mingled
with
the
zesty

nice
dark

notes
twords
the
end
of
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
almost
taffy
like
overall
sweetness
does
hurt
the
drinkability
a
little
drinkability
if
i
knew
when
this
bottle
was
packaged
i
would
be
able
to
guage
how
long
i
should
age
it
i
believe
that
this
may
mellow
with
time
right
now
its
a
little
tough
to
take
i
would
recommend
letting
this
cellar
for
a
year
or
three
maybe
ill
keep
a
few
bottles
for
a
year
or
two
to
see
if
that
edge
goes
away
im
sure
it
will
until
then
its
just
not
very
good
blithering
idiot
undoubtedly
is
a
description
of
someone
who
drinks
too
many
of
this
11
abv
brew
i
have
only
one
12
ounce
bottle
so
that
shouldnt
be
any
more
of
a
description
of
me
than
usual
its
a
beautiful
ruby
orange
color
in
the
glass
with
moderate
lacing
left
at
the
end
the
aroma
is
malty
sweetness
there
is
little
hops
influence
and
mostly
malt
in
the
flavor
which
favors
orange
dates
and
toffee
there
is
a
noticeable
alcohol
warming
mellow
in
character
that
i
dont
mind
on
a
december
night
of
12
degrees
this
is
my
first
barleywine
i
enjoyed
the
style
and
definitely
would
drink
this
version
again
full
bodied
beer
that
goes
down
very
smooth
pretty
good
beer
but
also
kind
of
average
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
this
beer
feels
rich
a
slight
fizziness
on
the
tongue
followed
by
this
really
creamy
texture
makes
this
really
balanced
and
drinkable
overall
not
the
best
barleywine
but
far
from
the
worse
i
would
call
it
middle
of
the
road
if
you
like
alcohol
burn
and
tons
of
malt
you
may
rate
this
one
a
bit
highter
d
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
english
style
barleywine
but
there
are
better
a
super
malty
super
boozy
barleywine
that
does
not
hide
its
booze
well
yeah
as
a
latenightfrontofafireinthedeadofwintersipper
its
outstanding
and
if
thats
all
youre
using
it
for
then
its
a
5
but
its
not
as
a
whole
this
is
a
beer
you
only
want
tocan
afford
to
have
one
of
which
is
fine
barley
wines
arent
sessionable
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
this
one
takes
some
effort
however
since
this
beer
eventually
becomes
insanity
it
gets
a
load
of
respect
you
need
a
good
base
and
this
is
it
it
just
needs
to
be
aged
in
oak
before
its
great
and
that
may
very
well
be
this
beers
most
noteworthy
and
interesting
fact
its
always
fun
to
imagine
with
big
beers
what
they
will
be
like
when
aged
awhile
its
why
so
many
people
cellar
this
beer
is
unique
because
its
probably
one
of
the
only
examples
we
have
of
beers
that
can
be
sampled
both
fresh
and
aged
commercially
produced
that
is
and
its
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
and
realize
why
beer
should
in
some
cases
be
cellared
this
beer
almost
proves
a
point
more
than
anything
its
kind
of
like
listening
to
kid
a
and
then
hearing
ok
computer
for
the
first
time
you
knew
that
when
you
listened
to
kid
a
that
radiohead
was
unique
ok
computer
showed
you
how
they
got
there
this
is
the
ok
computer
of
beers
i
like
that
i
picked
up
this
single
bottle
at
total
wine
in
greensboro
nc
just
over
a
week
ago
it
pours
a
nice
translucent
amber
into
a
pint
glass
the
head
didnt
last
long
even
though
it
began
with
a
nice
set
of
dense
offwhite
bubbles
i
was
reminded
of
strong
belgian
ales
as
i
took
a
deep
sniff
scents
of
brown
sugar
raisons
and
strong
caramel
malts
the
flavor
is
intense
and
the
alcohol
sets
in
rather
quickly
i
detected
flavors
of
caramel
ripe
dark
fruits
and
warming
alcohol
some
hops
are
certainly
present
at
the
finish
and
lingering
aftertaste
i
like
the
silky
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
its
not
overly
carbonated
this
is
a
very
good
barleywinestyle
ale
its
probably
my
second
favorite
behind
olde
school
by
dogfish
head
this
isnt
hard
to
drink
but
definetly
a
sipper
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
drinkability
wondering
why
on
earth
this
one
doesnt
get
a
4
or
better
average
this
was
one
of
the
better
english
style
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
maybe
it
ages
very
well
and
a
fresh
version
isnt
quite
as
good
at
any
rate
this
was
an
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
barley
wine
in
my
opinion
i
was
very
happy
to
receive
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
with
vwcraig
thanks
the
pour
was
a
nice
dark
orange
with
a
frothy
head
that
died
pretty
quick
the
smell
was
candy
and
caramel
and
sugars
yum
the
taste
was
also
like
candied
fruits
and
was
pretty
delicious
the
alcohol
was
not
overt
but
i
could
easily
tell
this
beer
was
a
powerhouse
excellent
brew
from
weyerbacher
and
restores
my
faith
after
that
raspberry
imperial
stout
mess
i
had
two
nights
ago
while
i
definitely
prefer
american
style
barleywines
especially
west
coast
this
was
a
winner
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
its
quite
creamy
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
high
abv
but
more
so
by
how
noticeable
and
burning
the
alcohol
is
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
but
its
a
sipper
for
sure
tastes
of
fruits
dates
and
prunes
come
to
mind
caramel
malts
and
a
huge
warming
alcohol
a
solid
ebw
and
i
am
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
this
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
offwhite
head
the
aroma
smells
like
a
concentrated
cherry
and
fruit
punch
mix
the
flavor
starts
with
a
big
sweet
light
caramel
candy
taste
the
flavor
is
balanced
a
bit
by
earthy
hops
but
the
malts
dominate
overall
this
beer
is
tasty
but
not
that
complex
and
the
alcohol
heat
catches
up
with
you
as
it
warms
still
worth
trying
if
youre
into
english
barleywines
drinkability
i
figured
there
was
a
reason
i
had
to
like
insanity
so
much
and
it
makes
sense
given
that
blithering
idiot
is
the
forefront
a
wonderfully
complex
english
barley
wine
and
i
do
say
that
im
more
of
a
fan
of
this
style
than
some
of
the
more
greener
and
raucous
american
barley
wines
not
so
much
hops
that
its
assaulting
and
wonderful
fruity
characteristics
abound
keep
it
up
weyerbacher
good
stuff
it
poured
out
smooth
although
with
very
little
head
normal
with
barleywine
and
absolutely
no
lacing
as
i
drank
it
bi
has
a
very
nice
deep
browncopper
color
it
had
an
excellent
scent
strongly
hoppy
and
for
some
reason
it
reminded
me
of
raisonwalnut
pie
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
it
went
down
smooth
although
it
was
a
little
rough
in
the
mouth
it
had
an
excellent
strong
flavor
not
as
bitter
as
i
would
have
thought
a
nice
balance
of
bitter
and
sweetness
drank
like
a
11
abv
barley
wine
maybe
this
ages
gracefully
not
impressed
as
solid
looking
brew
pours
a
very
hazy
orangish
brown
with
an
ok
head
that
soon
leaves
only
a
lace
around
the
ring
of
my
snifter
aroma
is
very
sweet
brown
sugar
and
caramel
and
those
characteristics
carry
over
to
the
taste
mixed
in
with
some
run
raisins
and
prunes
some
big
alcohol
backing
up
this
brew
but
the
sweetness
helps
this
brew
become
more
drinkable
goes
down
fairly
smooth
with
the
alcohol
not
becoming
too
overpowering
drinkability
have
a
few
on
a
wintery
day
or
if
you
have
to
go
shovel
snow
it
will
certainly
be
more
enjoyable
this
beer
would
do
well
with
more
complexity
in
the
taste
department
which
i
think
insanity
provides
through
oak
aging
however
it
is
an
afforable
barleywine
that
could
seal
the
deal
with
2
or
3
in
one
night
nicely
done
this
shocked
me
when
i
first
drank
it
the
smell
was
very
strong
i
was
able
to
get
used
to
it
and
the
typical
barley
wine
drinker
would
probably
too
however
this
is
not
the
faint
of
heart
i
felt
its
thickness
and
sharp
ultramalty
taste
was
welcomed
but
very
strong
during
first
sips
one
or
two
bottles
of
this
drink
is
far
enough
due
to
its
strong
alcohol
volume
more
than
that
will
probably
make
you
into
an
idiot
taste
is
very
malty
and
sweet
the
alcohol
can
be
tasted
and
leaves
a
nice
warmth
in
my
throat
bitterness
just
succeeds
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
develops
during
the
glass
in
the
end
it
is
a
bit
sharp
and
raw
but
not
in
a
bad
way
i
can
also
taste
some
citrus
in
here
probably
the
hops
the
yeast
leaves
a
nice
fruity
taste
and
reminds
me
of
an
english
yeast
strain
although
i
feel
this
is
a
nice
brew
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
which
made
it
a
bit
onedimensional
and
inhibited
the
drinkability
bottom
line
this
one
has
potential
to
be
a
really
good
bwsa
from
what
i
sampled
its
just
a
tad
too
hot
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
did
not
last
aromas
of
alcohol
and
a
dry
fruit
tastes
of
dry
dark
fruit
with
an
alcohol
end
a
dry
alcohol
aftertaste
also
a
fruit
presence
is
left
behind
as
well
big
alcohol
another
big
beer
yet
a
great
sipper
better
as
it
warms
up
by
not
being
so
abrasive
this
is
a
powerful
beer
that
is
deceptive
because
of
the
flavor
profile
the
balance

the
most
attractive
part
of
this

a
very
relaxing
sipping
beer
it
has

thanks
to
eyedrinkale
for
this
bottle
d
the
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
which
i
expected
but
this
is
still
an
enjoyable
brew
this
is
a
breakthrough
brew
for
me
because
i
was
turned
off
completely
to
barley
wine
by
a
different
brew
i
would
have
this
again
and
am
now
open
to
trying
other
barley
wines
nice
job
weyerbacher
d
the
alcohol
is
huge
in
this
beer
just
sitting
here
i
can
feel
the
effects
of
it
the
malts
dont
disappoint
and
there
is
a
surprisingly
strong
hop
body
midway
through
having
had
a
fresh
bottle
i
realize
that
my
previous
review
was
of
an
old
bottle
that
sat
in
the
bottle
shop
too
long
the
taste
hits
the
tongue
a
runnin
a
plethora
of
piney
hops
alcohol
sweet
caramel
malts
and
more
alcohol
theres
a
little
too
much
going
on
here
but
i
am
warming
up
to
the
barleywine
style
and
this
beer
definately
has
helped
that
process
a
crisp
sharp
mouthfeel
with
a
fantastic
bitter
hop
finish
ensues
all
in
all
this
brew
is
complex
enough
for
5
beers
its
tasty
and
packs
quite
a
punch
as
far
as
abv
goes
i
doubt
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
any
24
hour
period
but
its
something
id
surely
look
for
again
i
wish
i
had
taken
detailed
notes
on
this
beer
but
instead
im
relying
on
my
6th
sense
of
beer
perception
i
bought
a
blithering
idiot
first
time
ever
at
bocktown
outside
of
pittsburgh
i
had
remembered
hearing
good
things
about
the
brew
on
beeradvocate
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
i
was
impressed
big
smooth
a
nice
hoppy
balance
and
quite
drinkable
for
a
n
11
percent
beer
next
time
i
hope
to
document
my
tongues
impression
a
bit
better
nevertheless
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
drinkable
sort
of
unlike
the
tremendously
drinkable
bigfoot
imho
this
one
is
much
more
a
sipper
and
one
seems
more
than
enough
final
thought
quite
simply
a
solid
barley
wine
from
weyerbacher
d
not
really
too
much
punch
to
drink
more
than
1
i
had
higher
expectations
due
to
all
the
hype
what
did
public
enemy
say
dont
believe
the
oh
well
weyerbacher
always
seems
to
do
everything
too
big
too
much
spice
or
too
much
alcohol
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
this
is
an
attractive
beer
redorange
color
small
head
nicely
carbonated
it
had
a
dark
fruit
malty
aroma
the
taste
showed
a
strong
malt
presence
with
little
if
any
hops
this
was
a
mild
beer
not
at
all
aggressive
i
thought
it
to
be
very
drinkable
even
at

note
2
this
beer
is
the
reason
that
i
got
this
mixed
case
i
was
listening
to
the
basic
brewing
radio
podcast
and
they
were
talking
about
barley
wine
so
i
went
down
to
the
distributor
and
found
this
case
i
am
glad
that
i
enjoyed
the
other
beers
in
the
case
more
because
at
this
point
this
one
is
a
disappointment
i
still
have
a
two
bottles
of
this
left
in
a
dark
corner
of
my
cellar
so
i
will
allow
them
to
age
further
hopefully
that
will
curb
the
alcohol
and
allow
this
one
to
shine
i
think
that
it
really
could
of
course
this
is
the
only
barley
wine
ive
had
to
date
so
maybe
im
completely
off
base
drinkability
take
it
slow
first
sips
a
doozie
likely
youll
only
want
one
but
it
does
taste
better
as
you
go
along
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
bodied
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
more
than
a
couple
would
be
tough
due
to
the
abv
i
havent
had
many
barley
wines
to
compare
this
to
but
i
definately
like
this
beer
drinkability
i
have
to
admit
i
was
a
bit
of
latecomer
to
the
barley
wines
but
this
is
the
2nd
one
in
a
month
that
ive
enjoyed
immensely
both
english
style
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
when
i
first
got
my
case
and
wasnt
a
huge
fan
but
i
let
this
sit
for
about
45
months
and
the
results
were
fantastic
give
this
brew
a
try
but
maybe
let
it
sit
for
a
while
you
wont
be
disappointed
drinkability
well
its
a
big
bad
barleywine
youre
not
going
to
pound
several
of
these
unless
youre
me
several
years
ago
see
above
that
said
its
a
fairly
enjoyable
sipper
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
cellared
for
about
six
months
appears
a
dark
reddishamber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
dense
offwhite
foam
smells
of
sweet
malts
stewed
fruits
and
alcohol
tastes
of
sugary
caramel
malts
plumsprunes
and
maybe
a
touch
of
dried
cherry
full
bodied
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
barley
wine
recommended
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
this
poured
a
shiny
dark
copper
with
purple
hues
and
no
head
whatsoever
the
smell
was
the
best
part
of
the
beer
bringing
in
some
complexities
but
dominated
by
the
alcohol
presence
to
go
along
with
fruity
flavors
primarily
an
acidic
red
grape
the
taste
was
also
alcohol
dominant
combined
with
a
sharp
turn
to
the
carbonation
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
this
tastes
more
like
a
wine
or
a
cognac
than
a
barleywine
lots
of
complexities
just
not
wellmixed
maybe
ill
give
this
another
try
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
the
brewery
just
not
the
brew
in
front
of
me
oddly
this
tastes
pretty
darn
close
to
insanity
i
would
not
have
expected
this
much
vanilla
flavor
from
an
unoakaged
barley
wine
the
alcohol
is
very
prevalent
in
this
fresh
i
think
this
may
be
the
one
weyerbacher
brew
that
i
prefer
with
some
oak
aging
this
is
decent
but
not
as
nice
as
the
insanity
either
way
i
love
weyerbacher
and
everything
they
do
ill
happily
buy
this
again
d
for
what
it
is
its
almost
perfect
thanks
to
aprilluvsbeer
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
poured
a
semicloudy
bronze
orange
colour
with
an
offwhite
foamy
cap
that
faded
away
in
a
matter
of
seconds
a
patch
work
of
frost
still
remains
on
the
top
smell
is
sweet
malts
cooked
fruit
and
alcohol
lots
of
alcohol
taste
is
the
same
almost
reminding
me
of
a
belgian
tripel
with
its
cooked
fruit
note
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
far
from
an
english
barley
wine
any
english
barley
wine
ive
ever
had
anyway
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
a
solid
fullbodied
ale
drinkability
is
a
3
0
at
best
due
to
its
11abv
not
bad
all
physical
components
of
this
beer
such
as
color
pour
aroma
etc
were
well
crafted
however
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
was
set
back
by
its
high
alcohol
content
which
made
this
beer
hard
for
me
to
get
through
the
flavor
was
great
but
hope
for
more
of
it
to
balance
out
the
alcohol
i
really
liked
this
departure
from
some
of
the
other
barleywnes
on
the
market
sweeter
but
still
very
drinkable
poured
hazy
dark
dark
amber
with
sticky
head
and
lacing
ripe
fruits
very
sugary
malt
aromas
with
a
spicy
alcoholic
whiff
molasses
pure
and
simple
thick
slick
fruity
molasses
but
still
smooth
and
not
overly
sweet
finished
with
an
almost
roasted
character
and
a
slight
piney
hop
punch
i
can
hardly
taste
the
big
alcohol
though
the
bottle
is
more
than
a
few
months
old
highly
recommended
a
very
nice
barley
wine
style
from
a
vastly
underrated
brewery
i
finally
took
the
leap
and
purchased
this
wonderfullynomenclatured
beverage
at
a
local
beer
purveyor
not
because
im
any
type
of
barleywine
lover
but
because
i
love
weyerbacher
and
i
love
the
name
it
poured
a
rusty
brown
with
the
visual
luster
of
african
pond
water
and
hardly
any
head
the
flavor
was
characteristic
for
a
barleywine
stinging
and
alcoholy
caramel
and
malty
on
the
first
swallow
i
must
say
i
was
not
floored
the
way
i
expected
to
be
this
was
relatively
mellow
although
warming
in
my
throat
the
11
is
more
than
evident
but
well
balanced
within
a
fig
cookie
a
prune
shake
a
sugarplum
if
i
need
to
cozy
up
to
the
fire
this
february
with
a
barleywine
this
will
top
my
list

the
appearance
was
a
cooper
rust
orange
color
really
didnt
pick
up
much
of
a
smell
a
little
piney
and
some
sweet
malt
initial
taste
was
a
nice
warm
malt
with
quality
hop
character
even
thought
it
didnt
pour
with
much
of
a
head
it
did
have
a
nice
mouth
feel
not
the
best
of
the
barleywine
style
but
it
is
a
nice
balanced
warming
beer
that
i
really
did
enjoy
the
beer
has
a
complex
taste
malty
but
the
hops
are
noticable
as
is
the
alcohol
this
beer
isnt
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
but
it
serves
its
purpose
its
good
to
sip
on
during
a
cold
night
maybe
after
dinner
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
dark
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
appears
with
some
nice
islands
and
sticky
lacing
around
the
edges
the
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
hops
bubblegum
pineapple
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweetmalty
slight
alcohol
warming
effect
nice
slight
bitter
clean
finish
medium
body
well
rounded
brew
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
one
some
what
different
than
other
bwsa
ive
had
in
taste
highly
recommended
i
dont
know
how
to
improve
this
beer
except
it
could
use
a
little
more
filtration
all
that
yeast
weighs
down
this
great
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
definitely
a
sipper
as
its
kind
of
hot
though
i
think
if
you
had
more
than
a
couple
of
these
in
short
time
youd
be
much
like
this
beers
namesake
d
really
suffers
from
the
fact
that
this
brew
is
all
alcohol
maybe
some
age
would
help
the
flavors
pull
together
this
is
a
wonderfully
delicious
brew
d
this
beer
has
a
smooth
flavor
with
good
depth
and
makes
a
big
beer
very
drinkable
this
is
a
raw
one
i
didnt
mind
the
high
abv
expected
for
style
but
its
too
sharp
to
really
enjoy
and
there
is
some
flavor
but
not
enough
to
cover
the
persistant
alcohol
an
ok
slowsipper
but
not
as
rich
and
complex
as
other
barleywines
out
there
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
one
and
will
always
pick
up
if
i
see
it
a
good
representation
of
the
style
without
going
way
off
in
left
field
with
strange
flavors
a
flavorful
high
octaine
barleywine
a
sipping
ale
to
be
enjoyed
with
friends
in
the
colder
months
or
by
yourself
in
the
dead
of
summer
either
way
a
delicious
offering
drinkability
is
not
terrible
its
just
slow
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
enough
to
want
to
finish
the
bottle
and
the
enjoyed
the
alcoholic
bite
a
real
winter
warmer
and
i
think
ill
find
another
one
to
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
this
one
needs
time
to
blend
and
mellow
into
perfection
i
had
a
lot
of
sediment
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
enough
to
make
a
tornado
of
it
while
swirling
the
glass
and
this
beer
was
made
to
soak
in
that
a
while
longer
blithering
idiot
wins
in
the
first
round
by
tko
the
alcohol
beat
me
into
submission
right
now
this
one
is
rather
unbalanced
i
dont
know
if
that
is
necessarily
bad
but
im
going
to
cellar
a
few
of
these
to
see
what
becomes
of
them
with
any
luck
this
badass
will
mellow
out
a
little
bit
i
look
forward
to
encountering
it
again
high
abv
savor
this
at
the
end
of
your
day
by
the
fire
cheers
opened
up
this
bottle
after
having
aged
it
for
two
years
still
a
strong
beer
witha
nice
light
head
from
the
poor
and
a
great
smell
in
the
nose
lots
of
dark
fruit
raisins
and
caramel
musty
old
ale
smell
with
the
strong
alcohol
rising
up
to
grab
you
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
oxidized
and
doesnt
improve
the
beer
i
really
liked
it
fresh
same
batch
of
bottles
but
the
aging
didnt
improve
this
one
head
somewhere
else
for
something
to
cellar
yet
another
barleywine
with
an
entertaining
name
this
one
is
as
fun
to
drink
as
it
is
to
say
the
abv
is
heavy
duty
and
in
your
face
and
its
also
very
warm
maybe
even
hot
but
it
doesnt
distract
so
much
as
it
joins
in
making
the
whole
presentation
seem
big
it
drinks
cautiously
but
well
it
seems
blithering
like
an
idiot
can
indeed
be
a
good
thing
md
extremely
complex
and
changing
all
the
time
many
flavors
in
a
thick
hearty
ale
a
beer
i
enjoy
and
at
an
extremely
reasonable
price
2
99
for
12
oz
at
my
local
store
pours
a
one
finger
tan
color
head
which
fades
quickly
very
little
lacing
and
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
smell
sweet
fruity
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
you
know
you
have
some
serious
beer
here
taste
is
sweet
of
ripe
peaches
with
rum
or
brandy
other
fruity
taste
there
mouthfeel
is
medium
syrupy
but
enjoyable
this
is
my
first
time
for
this
type
of
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
would
not
drink
to
many
at
one
sitting
no
doubt
about
it
this
is
a
beer
to
be
savored
one
to
drink
slowly
its
very
drinkable
for
its
strength
to
the
point
i
almost
forgot
it
was
such
a
strong
brew
creamy
and
smooth
i
could
put
away
a
couple
of
these
on
a
cold
winters
night
and
i
think
id
be
quite
satisfied
after
that
d
good
barleywine
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
in
the
taste
catergory
though
d
i
had
a
great
time
enjoying
this
drink
and
hope
to
enjoy
it
again
gave
me
some
odd
flashbacks
of
robotripping
ha
have
1
to
many
though
and
i
may
become
the
blithering
idiot
had
a
rough
time
finishing
one
beernot
a
beer
i
would
care
to
drink
again
cheers2beers
this
beer
pours
a
translucent
amber
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
holds
little
leaving
little
lace
the
smell
is
sweet
caramel
with
other
malty
aromas
very
little
hops
are
present
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
bit
of
almost
tea
like
flavor
providing
some
bitterness
again
very
little
hops
appear
in
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
a
full
body
with
nice
carbonation
overall
its
a
decent
barley
wine
but
it
does
not
approach
the
complexity
and
superiority
that
an
american
barley
wine
offers
notes
i
love
this
barleywine
big
malt
and
fruity
flavors
with
that
nice
warming
alcohol
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
well
for
a
barleywine
probably
has
something
to
do
with
the
low
hopping
rate
gotta
give
props
for
the
clever
name
as
well
i
am
interested
in
having
this
again
just
not
quickly
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
like
to
try
some
more
bw
before
this
again
the
taste
is
simply
outstanding
richer
perhaps
than
samichlaus
for
gawsh
sakes
id
say
the
sami
is
a
tad
smoother
though
right
now
my
top
3
favorites
are
samichlaus
bier
dogfish
head
120
minute
ipa
and
this
weyerbacher
blithering
idiot
perhaps
i
like
the
barley
wine
style
but
this
one
is
special
overall
this
is
a
good
if
somewhat
unsurprising
barleywine
very
sweet
very
strong
and
fairly
smooth
overall
a
beautiful
looking
beer
hazed
cherry
coloured
with
just
enough
clarity
to
see
a
blurred
finger
through
the
other
side
little
bits
of
yeast
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
bottom
of
the
tulip
glass
lovely
responsive
carbonation
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
then
sizzle
out
a
bourbon
like
aroma
full
of
alcohol
and
sweet
sherrylike
notes
very
sweet
a
candy
malt
to
the
extreme
mouthfeel
is
spotlessly
smooth
a
dense
presence
of
malt
that
fades
ever
so
gently
like
a
gentle
giant
too
gently
maybe
considering
how
bold
its
flavour
is
big
upfront
malt
flavour
with
no
depth
or
resonance
alcohol
easily
noticeable
but
not
in
the
least
distracting
drinkability
is
more
than
fair
this
has
some
great
features
i
would
surely
recommend
but
it
honestly
failed
to
get
me
going
in
ways
other
barleywines
have
pours
like
a
belgian
dubble
great
lacing
but
minimal
head
aroma
and
taste
is
mascerated
fruit
and
rum
boozy
and
big
but
in
a
good
way
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
its
not
obtrusive
mouthfeel
is
okay
not
great
but
not
bad
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
not
a
home
run
hitter
drinkability
on
this
one
would
probably
be
good
with
a
little
age
but
right
now
its
still
a
little
hot
i
can
see
the
potential
though
so
im
going
to
add
it
back
onto
my
wants
and
see
if
i
can
lay
one
down
for
a
while
d
it
warms
you
up
but
be
careful
cheers
jeff
d
it
is
very
good
i
would
definitely
say
it
is
a
sipper
maybe
a
little
better
at
hiding
the
alcohol
and
this
beer
would
be
very
good
would
buy
this
again
if
i
had
it
available
enjoy
if
you
can
get
it
cellar
it
for
sure
you
know
maybe
this
one
needs
to
age
some
or
something
i
dont
think
id
go
for
this
in
lieu
of
more
flavorful
wines
the
alcohols
just
too
strong
and
too
prominent
if
it
mellowed
a
bit
i
think
itd
be
a
different
experience
had
this
at
an
oktoberfest
and
glad
that
i
did
cause
i
dont
think
i
would
have
tried
it
anywhere
else
poured
a
deep
chocolate
color
with
hints
of
red
in
it
dont
quote
me
on
this
though
i
had
a
few
beers
in
me
at
the
time
not
being
a
big
barley
wine
person
i
was
amazed
on
how
smooth
and
good
this
beer
was
would
definetly
try
again
all
four
beers
ive
tried
from
weyerbacher
have
been
fantastic
and
blithering
idiot
is
no
different
tried
at
the
charlotte
oktoberfest
and
though
my
brother
disliked
it
it
was
his
first
barley
wine
i
would
like
to
review
it
further
with
a
bigger
sample
but
it
was
worth
saying
to
spend
the
money
if
you
see
it
out
there
blithering
idiot
is
right
at
least
after
more
than
one
of
these
its
a
very
tasty
and
i
would
want
more
in
the
future
but
theres
no
way
i
would
want
to
do
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
im
feeling
very
happy
and
complete
after
just
one
opinion
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
barley
wine
it
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
drinkable
hop
balance
it
is
really
balanced
for
this
styleespecially
for
an
american
version
the
whole
thing
comes
across
as
a
tad
heavy
but
what
can
you
expect
from
a
beer
that
is
strong
and
tastes
this
mild
this
is
a
really
good
barley
wine
and
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
other
notes
not
bad
but
will
probably
get
better
with
some
age
ill
lay
aside
the
rest
of
them
for
a
year
or
so

blithering
idiot

this
bottle
comes
from
the
same
variety
case
as
my
previous
review
after
over
a
year
in
the
cellar
we
have
some
nice
changes
the
beer
forms
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
in
my
snifter
which
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
of
large
bubbles
over
a
murky
rubybrown
body
filled
with
yeast
sediment
the
nose
is
still
highly
alcoholic
with
sugar
caramel
and
strong
malt
the
taste
has
mild
caramel
and
is
mildly
fruity
its
mellowed
a
lot
and
hides
the
alcohol
much
better
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
low
carbonation
it
should
be
chewier
a
nice
easy
bw
pours
an
inviting
medium
brown
and
copper
color
and
clear
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
which
fades
back
quickly
great
aroma
of
dried
cherries
a
little
bit
of
sweet
grape
toasted
coconut
with
marshmallow
and
a
little
pineapple
juice
a
very
rich
barleywine
aroma
with
nice
complexity
one
you
cant
stop
sniffing
the
taste
wasnt
quite
as
complex
but
was
still
enjoyable
and
had
some
malty
breadiness
and
caramel
flavors
decent
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
and
nice
drying
finish
also
a
decent
amount
of
hop
bitterness
for
the
style
enjoyable
barleywine
d
really
like
this
one
i
like
alcohol
warmth
and
fruit
sweetness
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
along
with
bells
third
coast
old
ale
this
is
a
very
very
nice
barleywine
overall
quite
enjoyable
a
sipper
for
me
but
still
quite
drinkable
pours
a
pretty
dark
coppery
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
very
sweet
aroma
with
some
fruit
notes
apples
and
oranges
very
sweet
malt
flavor
with
some
citrusy
and
spicy
hops
that
leave
a
lingering
bitterness
nicely
balanced
alcohol
is
also
noticable
heavy
mouthfeel
and
very
carbonated
perhaps
a
bit
too
carbonated
pretty
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
deep
copper
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissolves
to
clingy
lace
easy
drinker
despite
the
high
abv
very
well
concealed
strength
flavor
and
aroma
are
largely
one
dimensional
and
port
like
that
port
quality
consists
largely
of
booze
soaked
dark
fruits
and
spices
that
tend
to
indicate
high
alcohol
presence
hops
are
much
lighter
than
expected
indicating
that
this
barley
wine
follows
the
english
tradition
rather
than
the
american
mouthfeel
is
rather
warming
and
light
for
a
barley
wine
flavor
and
aroma
greatly
improve
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temp
but
it
remains
rather
dull
and
lacking
in
complexity
still
very
drinkable
and
in
fact
dangerously
easy
to
gulp
down
many
thanks
to
expatsteve
for
the
sample
the
smell
is
strong
with
hefty
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
also
powerful
dark
malt
dominates
with
some
caramel
flavor
alcohol
comes
through
while
hops
are
lightly
present
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
full
drinkability
is
very
good
especially
considering
the
alcohol
content
thanks
to
beerbeing
for
another
fine
brew
overall
an
excellent
representation
of
the
class
i
do
prefer
a
bit
more
hops
in
my
bw
but
a
still
an
excellent
example
d
yet
another
mediocre
brew
from
weyerbacher
drinkable
but
there
are
too
many
other
good
barleywines
to
buy
this
one
again
d
this
one
is
slightly
hard
to
drink
due
to
the
booze
flavor
bravo
bravo
bravo
a
wonderful
beverage
if
you
dont
like
the
taste
of
booze
stay
away
go
try
a
soda
or
something
the
flavor
to
balance
in
here
is
good
i
agree
with
some
that
a
year
or
so
may
make
this
a
gem
for
now
it
is
just
a
very
solid
bw
that
could
use
a
touch
of
smoothing
d
this
is
a
good
straight
forward
version
of
an
english
barleywine
malts
definately
run
the
show
it
this
beer
the
hops
play
second
fiddle
very
smooth
with
no
bite
at
all
in
the
finish
overall
a
very
nice
barley
wine
im
beginning
to
enjoy
this
style
more
and
more
ill
have
to
get
a
fresh
one
of
these
soon
to
compare
and
see
how
this
one
aged
another
solid
offering
from
weyerbacher
drinkability
i
could
be
persuaded
to
drink
another
one
but
only
after
a
while
be
careful
with
this
one
because
if
you
drink
two
or
more
of
these
in
a
sitting
you
will
become
a
blithering
idiot
a
nice
barley
wine
the
beer
is
very
rich
in
unusual
malt
flavors
but
the
bitterness
balances
it
nicely
drinkabilityoverall
against
a
lineup
of
true
competition
this
one
just
didnt
hold
up
as
well
needs
more
complexity
be
it
in
the
malts
or
hops
to
compete
with
the
almost
oppressive
booze
that
when
compared
to
vikings
berserk
isnt
well
hidden
at
all
uf
drinkability

wellthose
huge
dominant
characteristics
just
burn
too
much
not
that
balanced
and
not
that
easy
to
down
drinkability
as
a
strong
barleywine
id
probably
stick
to
one
or
two
and
was
glad
to
split
this
bottle
with
golden2wenty1
and
dapeculierdane
nicely
balanced
with
a
good
solid
flavor
definitely
something
id
return
to
in
colder
months
its
a
bit
too
sugary
tasting
and
the
alcohol
could
be
hidden
quite
a
bit
better
its
not
bad
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
english
barley
wine
i
might
get
another
one
of
these
and
sit
it
down
for
a
year
or
four
tastes
vanilla
and
caramel
toffee
and
sherry
oxidation
a
bit
hot
in
the
alcohol
but
its
a
clean
burn
the
alcohol
is
covered
by
a
wet
fruity
and
sweet
actually
there
are
quite
a
few
dark
fruit
flavors
in
here
like
i
find
in
st
bernardus
abt
12
chocolate
covered
plum
and
raisin
with
a
touch
of
cherry
sour
thick
mouthfeel
and
mild
carbonation
consumed
cellar
temp
and
allowed
to
warm
this
was
a
deliciousmalty
treat
this
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
orange
with
a
small
white
head
not
bad
for
a
barleywinebut
nothing
really
special
the
smell
is
lighter
than
other
barleywines
with
only
a
small
aroma
of
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
present
the
taste
is
creamy
with
dark
fruit
and
alcoholthis
beer
packs
a
punch
and
leaves
your
mouth
with
a
slightly
bitter
hop
aftertaste
the
mf
is
heavy
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
okbut
the
alcohol
taste
does
dominate
this
beer
making
this
less
complex
than
other
barleywines
a
decent
beerbut
i
really
expected
more
tastes
of
rich
malt
and
oaky
vanilla
lots
of
alcohol
overpowers
the
other
flavors
a
bit
some
biting
hops
in
the
finish
as
it
warms
lightly
sticky
mouth
big
beer
some
hops
linger
builds
as
you
get
further
down
the
pint
this
could
use
a
bit
of
age
its
a
little
hot
right
now
loads
of
potential
though
the
taste
is
astringent
at
first
and
numbing
but
not
puckering
however
this
barleywine
provides
its
own
salve
by
way
of
a
huge
caramel
malt
backbone
that
is
crafted
like
a
spun
sugar
sculpture
beautiful
dark
spots
of
charred
grains
are
reminiscent
of
wood
and
tannin
and
toasted
peanut
brittle
there
are
pithy
pits
of
cherry
and
peaches
this
is
sticky
and
fragrant
like
a
local
and
strange
honey
and
like
a
homemade
fruit
cordial
this
is
100
barley
wine
i
love
the
ultrahopped
us
barley
wines
theyre
almost
worth
dying
for
but
its
nice
to
experience
something
different
with
more
balance
but
drink
it
too
fast
and
itll
knock
your
socks
off
just
the
same
overall
a
nice
light
barlywine
this
one
doesnt
cause
you
to
pucker
your
mouth
or
whip
your
head
about
nice
and
mild
a
good
choice
pours
a
murky
deep
amber
with
a
very
nice
tan
head
that
retains
well
for
an
11
the
aroma
is
a
rich
amalgam
of
dark
fruits
fig
plum
cherry
grape
caramel
toffee
toasted
bread
esters
floral
hops
and
alcohol
very
british
and
very
appealing
the
taste
has
intense
notes
of
caramel
toffee
dark
fruits
fig
plum
cherry
grape
floral
hops
esters
toasted
bread
and
ethanol
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
while
carbonation
is
light
and
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
an
english
barleywine
structured
like
j
w
lees
with
a
sweet
finish
this
is
a
definite
winner
okay
to
good
drinkability
maybe
a
tad
to
bitter
for
a
barley
wine
a
really
like
this
brew
however
at
11
it
is
quite
strong
so
sipping
is
recommended
received
in
a
trade
from
fish113d
deep
cloudy
dark
copper
and
amber
mix
the
head
is
short
but
is
nice
and
swirly
with
good
retention
subtle
streaming
carbonation
is
also
visible
the
aroma
is
fairly
strong
mostly
malty
with
a
nose
of
raisin
and
sugar
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
reminiscent
of
a
wee
heavy
or
perhaps
even
a
doppelbock
the
taste
leans
heavily
on
the
malt
side
also
with
cinnamon
raisin
dominating
the
bitterness
remains
low
and
there
isnt
much
hop
balance
to
go
with
the
alcohol
is
well
disguised
mouthfeel
is
slightly
buttery
and
smooth
the
carbonation
is
again
mild
but
adequate
this
brew
had
alot
of
flavor
but
seemed
very
onedimensional
for
me
decreasing
the
drinkablility
significantly
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
good
enjoyed
every
sip
a
big
alcohol
presence
but
it
feels
right
at
home
in
this
one
overall
a
wellbalanced
example
of
the
style
sometimes
i
am
inspired
by
the
weyerbacher
beers
and
sometimes
i
am
not
their
blithering
idiot
barleywinestyle
left
me
somewhere
in
the
middle
nice
pour
rich
burntorange
copper
color
head
dissipated
quickly
with
little
to
no
lace
hearty
aroma
hints
of
plum
molasses
prunes
spicy
scent
too
which
was
nice
a
very
settling
flavor
considering
the
high
abv
this
wasnt
an
overpowering
barleywine
i
could
see
myself
having
two
of
these
before
realizing
the
alcohol
content
nice
mouthfeel
sturdy
but
not
too
malty
not
too
syrupy
which
many
barleywines
can
be
nice
clean
finish
the
weyerbacher
quad
is
a
bit
strong
for
my
tastes
but
id
come
back
to
the
blithering
idiot
for
seconds
bottom
line
its
not
quite
at
old
guardians
level
but
its
right
there
with
old
ruffian
hog
heaven
and
their
ilk
much
better
than
the
old

05
a
fine
fine
barleywine
ale
above
average
bw
six
years
has
added
some
sophistication
and
complexities
that
are
a
great
surprise
the
mouthfeel
was
textured
with
a
moderate
carbonation
on
the
palate
notes
of
creme
sherry
carameltoffee
piney
resin
and
fig
it
fades
in
a
long
finish
of
toasted
brown
sugar
and
grahm
cracker
with
a
subtle
hop
structure
that
looses
some
balance
to
the
maltiness
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
darkish
amber
color
with
a
very
small
head
aroma
was
very
sweet
smelling
and
winey
taste
was
very
sweet
also
with
notes
of
syrup
wine
and
alcohol
and
some
caramelly
notes
hop
bitterness
was
subdued
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
way
too
sweet
and
tasted
like
extract
was
used
in
the
brewing
process
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
high
alcohol
and
overwhelming
sweet
taste
i
like
english
style
barleywines
notably
old
nick
and
hardys
but
this
one
was
a
disappointment
perhaps
this
brew
requires
a
year
or
2
of
aging
in
order
to
round
out
i
really
enjoyed
slowly
sipping
this
one
and
would
purchase
again
d
good
drinkability
i
like
e
b
w
s
and
this
was
a
good
one
well
done
thanks
to
maltygoodness
and
bif
across
america
for
this
one
i
am
ready
for
bifaa
part
2
drinkability
too
big
a
beer
for
continuous
consumption
but
not
bad
at
all
packs
a
rich
milieu
of
flavor
and
goes
down
rather
easy
fairly
wellbalanced
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
really
smack
you
across
the
face
despite
expectations
a
winner
in
my
book
12
oz
bottle
provided
by
thaichile
i
could
imagine
drinking
this
on
a
cold
fall
day
or
in
the
middle
of
winter
after
the
driveway
has
been
shoveled
what
makes
this
stand
out
is
that
it
is
balanced
better
than
many
other
barley
wines
but
this
may
be
personal
choice
some
may
prefer
certain
flavors
to
stand
out
moreso
than
others
dark
maroon
body
lack
of
a
very
large
head
alcohol
and
sweet
fruits
in
the
nose
small
hoppiness
toffee
taste
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
the
two
seem
to
define
the
beer
the
lack
of
a
huge
hops
presence
easily
identifies
this
one
as
english
style
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
versus
others
in
the
style
pours
a
brownish
red
very
thin
headwith
no
retentionand
only
a
bit
of
lace
smell
sweet
molasses
suryp
and
alchol
dominate
body
is
thickand
not
much
carbonation
taste
is
sweet
like
the
smell
from
start
to
finish
this
beer
is
a
little
sweeter
than
the
other
barleywines
ive
tried
for
me
its
a
bit
to
sweet
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
still
a
very
good
beer
d
a
good
apertif
in
a
small
glass
with
a
sweet
molasses
based
dessert
like
shoofly
pie
oelergud
i
say
this
ale
is
perfect
for
shakespeare
christmas
dickens
and
monty
python
very
rich
and
vibrant
aroma
which
hints
of
brandy
soaked
malts
and
loads
of
fruits
cherries
grapes
along
with
wine
caramel
anc
chocolate
just
a
great
refined
malt
aroma
perfect
dark
red
color
monstrous
body
which
seems
to
elevate
all
the
juicy
malt
flavors
doughy
pastry
like
malt
flavors
initially
which
on
the
midpalate
transform
into
rich
layers
of
vinous
fruits
which
hints
of
blueberries
plums
figs
and
cherries
on
the
finish
another
complete
transformation
comes
into
play
and
toffee
caramel
vanilla
and
more
vinous

what
balance
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
ive
ever
had
and
without
a
doubt
the
best
english
barley
wine
ever
overall
id
say
this
is
average
for
the
style
i
just
wish
it
was
balanced
more
evenly
not
my
usual
barleywine
but
it
was
an
interesting
experience
i
must
say
i
really
enjoy
this
barley
wine
i
am
a
wine
lover
first
and
this
has
some
very
tawny
port
similarities
woodsy
notes
with
molasses
maple
syrup
choclate
and
caramel
in
the
mouth
one
of
the
better
noses
on
a
brew
i
can
remember
would
love
to
try
it
on
draft
ive
spoken
poorly
of
weyerbacher
before
but
i
take
it
back
or
at
least
will
give
them
another
try
after
trying
this
beer
although
nothing
overly
original
a
note
for
note
almost
perfect
example
of
a
textbook
english
style
barleywine
very
nice
i
really
liked
the
oak
characteristics
of
this
beer
the
dryness
just
added
to
the
dynamics
and
made
this
a
hands
down
delicious
beer
im
a
dirty
martini
girl
absolute
up
extra
dry
extra
garbage
incase
any
of
you
ever
run
into
me
and
care
to
get
me
a
drink
lol
so
the
obvious
alcohol
flovors
for
me
were
welcome
i
love
a
beer
that
i
know
can
kick
me
in
the
rear
if
i
dont
treat
it
right
this
is
certainly
not
a
beverage
for
the
beginner
really
great
representation
of
this
style
drinkability
is
good
i
could
easily
bludgeon
my
brain
with
a
few
glasses
of
this
one
it
is
not
a
lightweight
i
could
also
imagine
how
this
one
earned
its
name
when
i
consider
the
drinkability
here
not
bad
at
all
one
of
the
best
barley
wines
out
there
strong
alcohol
and
thinly
sweet
malts
throughout
from
the
onset
gives
the
sensation
of
warming
and
lightly
fusal
yet
pleasant
boldly
sweet
with
syrup
molassas
and
brown
sugar
hopped
for
balance
and
light
bittering
moderately
thick
and
silky
to
the
palate
finishes
with
a
light
sweetness
light
drying
and
palate
clensing
bitterness
i
will
be
drinking
quite
a
bit
more
of
these
its
certainly
an
enlish
barley
wine
with
a
subtle
american
twist
rich
full
mouth
feel
that
coats
the
mouth
the
flavors
are
complex
and
start
syruppy
sweet
and
ends
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
full
bodied
and
strong
with
strong
alcoholic
backbone
overall
very
very
drinkable
two
guests
who
drank
with
me
had
the
same
opinion
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
big
fun
to
gnaw
on
opaque
mohogany
color
with
a
small
amount
of
head
that
didnt
last
long
aroma
is
of
caramel
coffee
fruit
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
sweet
caramel
taste
with
some
almods
raisins
toffee
and
a
little
brown
sugar
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
its
strength
i
had
to
pace
myself
with
this
one
overall
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
barley
wines
this
one
isnt
recommended
and
id
never
try
it
again
as
its
too
overwhelming
and
theres
many
other
extreme
beers
id
chose
over
this
overall
im
glad
that
the
variety
pack
comes
with
a
couple
of
these
not
sure
id
buy
a
whole
case
unless
i
was
expecting
some
company
this
is
my
first
barleywine
and
im
impressed
this
one
made
a
fine
dessert
beer
now
i
really
want
to
try
an
american
styled
one
12
oz
bottle
not
dated
poured
into
a
snifter

a
dark
plumbrown
with
a
finger
of
offwhite

that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of

on
the
glass
nose
is
dark
and
alcoholiclaced
fruitcherry
fig
prune
some
sweet
brown
sugar
no
hops
taste
has
a
nice
big
malt
backbone
highlighted
with
the
same
fruits
from
the
nose
some
caramel
notes
a
slight
alcholic
bite
considering
the
abv
this
is
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
just
a
slight
hop
bite
but
the
sweetness
never
becomes
cloying
full
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
this
has
a
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
pretty
nice
barleywine
packing
a
punch
but
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
althought
not
nearly
hoppy
enough
for
this
hophead
the
aroma
is
more
powerful
than
the
flavor
in
this
barleywine
perhaps
a
bit
too
vinous
for
my
taste
of
course
it
is
quite
high
in
alcohol
as
the
not
so
subtle
name
might
suggest
i
imagine
it
could
smooth
out
quite
a
bit
with
time
very
much
an
intense
rich
malty
beverage
sip
with
caution
this
weyerbacher
offering
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
an
english
barleywine
that
ive
run
across
i
will
never
like
maltdominant
versions
of
the
style
as
much
as
i
like
balanced
or
especially
hopdominant
versions
but
ive
had
a
good
time
with
this
one
its
solid
all
the
way
around
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
for
the
blithering
idiot
dark
brown
and
purpleish
with
a
small
head
that
fades
to
nothing
nose
is
dark
fruits
like
crazy
sweet
caramel
alcohol
and
a
faint
balancing
roasted
nuttiness
taste
is
packed
full
of
purple
fruits
with
an
alcohol
punch
to
the
face
a
few
of
these
and
ill
definitely
be
pacified
overall
mellow
and
full
of
various
fruit
the
bitterness
is
countered
by
thick
grape
sweetness
low
carbonation
lends
itself
to
the
mellow
sweetness
drinkable
but
you
need
to
takes
your
time
with
this
drinkable
for
a
barley
wine
indeed
especially
on
those
cold
pennsylvania
winter
nights
sit
by
the
fireside
with
this
one
you
wont
be
disappointed
cheers
a
little
too
sweet
to
enjoy
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
drinkability
for
the
style
quite
deep
orange
clear
except
for
a
few
yeast
flecks
floating
around
short
beige
head
composed
of
small
bubbles
that
produced
a
bit
off
lace
malt
and
alcohol
dominate
the
aroma
its
also
a
bit
vinous
with
some
prune
character
which
gives
it
a
kind
of
rum
raisin
smell
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
flavour
from
the
start
moderate
bitterness
with
a
big
vinous
caramel
malt
taste
some
toffee
and
ripe
fruit
kick
in
midpoint
leading
to
a
caramel
sweet
finish
dry
and
slightly
astringent
the
texture
is
fair
and
the
carbonation
is
on
the
light
side
an
interesting
barleywine
if
the
alcohol
wasnt
quite
so
forward
read
hot
and
solventlike
in
the
flavour
and
aroma
it
would
be
a
lot
more
enjoyable
i
cant
rate
it
down
too
far
though
because
the
rest
of
the
character
is
actually
quite
nice
maybe
some
aging
would
do
this
some
good
this
beer
looked
thick
almost
like
really
cold
country
apple
cider
but
darker
there
debris
floating
throughout
the
beer
with
it
being
more
concentrated
at
the
bottom
smell
was
sweet
fruity
yeasty
and
some
alcohol
aroma
fruit
aroma
of
dates
taste
was
much
like
it
smelled
but
the
alcohol
got
much
stronger
as
the
beer
sat
and
also
seemed
to
get
sweeter
as
it
sat
which
gave
it
a
more
complex
dark
fruit
flavor
a
mild
fresh
grass
hop
flavor
was
also
present
mouthfeel
was
really
thick
with
low
carbonation
but
this
is
my
first
barley
wine
so
i
dont
know
how
it
compares
to
others
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
and
still
enjoy
it
im
not
sure
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
but
it
sure
is
good
very
well
made
english
barleywine
its
more
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
compared
to
american
barleywines
delicious
asskicking
and
yummy
what
a
combination
d
definilty
not
a
session
beer
a
little
of
for
its
desired
target
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
very
nice
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
considering
alcohol
content
id
get
it
again
some
beers
are
very
hard
to
judge
objectivley
when
you
cant
get
out
of
your
mind
what
you
paid
for
it
this
overall
is
not
a
bad
bw
but
in
no
way
would
i
seek
it
out
again
side
note
when
i
first
saw
the
bottle
i
thought
the
jester
was
giving
me
the
finger
upon
closer
inspection
i
realized
i
was
wrong

going
down
extremely
unbalanced
in
a
not

good
way
pretty
rough
on
the
senses
the
taste
is
sweet
and
loaded
with
caramel
malt
and
some
fruits
there
are
a
lot
of
sugars
running
around
and
some
light
hops
are
felt
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
very
lightly
carbonated
not
as
unrefined
as
the
taste
and
nose
i
give
a
low
score
for
drinkability
only
because
i
intend
to
age
the
rest
of
my
bottles
for
at

a
year

this
is

after
all
but
it
doesnt
get
in
the

this
is
a
smooth

barleywine
like
a
brown
ale
on
steroids
some
toast
cocoa
and
touch
of
pepper
aftertaste
of
a

this
drinks
better
fresh
now
than
it
ever
has
before
i
think
we
have
the
larger
capacity
and
the
better
boil
of
the
new
brew
house
to
thank
for
that
this
is
a
barleywine
that
i
turn
to
several
times
a
week

thanks
to
steelreign
for
the
trade
i
will
pick
up
some
of
this
again
if
i
come
across
it
the
first
taste
i
notice
is
of
course
the
sweet
malt
then
comes
the
ethanol
not
too
assertive
but
definately
noticeable
very
light
hints
of
tobacco
are
present
along
with
some
of
the
banana
and
tree
fruits
that
were
also
present
in
the
nose
notes
of
old
leather
and
wood
are
present
in
a
good
earthy
way
finish
with
a
perfect
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
shadowed
by
a
lingering
dark
sweetness
excellent
beer
the
beer
poured
an
amber
or
orange
color
somewhat
cloudy
with
very
little
head
what
head
was
there
was
not
too
thick
and
left
quite
quickly
the
scent
was
citrus
sticky
fruity
and
somewhat
harsh
the
taste
was
the
same
quite
malty
somewhat
hoppy
and
there
was
the
taste
of
citrus
and
dark
fruits
the
alcohol
does
bite
so
beware
overall
a
nice
flavor
quite
bold
a
decent
barleywine
though
im
not
sure
ill
try
it
again

strong

it

some

it
too
it
does
have

to

the

is
very
citrus
but
not
sweet
at
all
just
accents
of
it
no
feel
of

until
the
finish
and
it
is
just
for
a
split
second
wow
just
looked
at
the
abv
is
is
11
no
signs
of
this
i
will
be
drinking
loads
of
this
another
terrific
effort
by
weyerbacher
the
more
i
drink
their
beers
the
more
i
like
them
quick
story
i
was
buying
2
6packs
of
the
idiot
from
ronnies
ronnie
doesnt
have
the
widest
isles
in
front
of
the
micros
and
i
was
juggling
one
trying
to
pull
the
second
off
the
shelf
well
it
turns
out
i
was
the
blithering
idiot
by
dropping
the
second
6er
and
smashing
it
on
the
concrete
floor
i
only
broke
3
of
them
but
thats
when
i
realized
what
a
great
nose
this
beer
has
and
the
color
was
a
hazy
amber
laying
in
a
puddle
although
tempted
to
do
a
dog
impression
i
waited
until
i
got
home
to
drink
it
didnt
disappoint
bottle
poured
a
deep
amber
looking
ale
with
a
medium
head
that
disappeared
quickly
aroma
is
quite
sweet
with
some
great
malt
also
noticeable
taste
is
very
warming
which
is
probably
due
to
the
high
content
of
alcohol
which
is
not
easily
discernable
quite
sweet
throughout
with
some
caramel
and
light
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
this
is
very
pleasant
stuff
and
looking
forward
to
try
the
insanity
a
slightly
hazy
dark
copper
colored
beer
has
asmall
beige
head
has
the
standard
alcohol
laden
aroma
with
hints
of
fruit
and
hops
ther
taste
starts
with
a
light
hint
of
sweetness
that
quickly
becomes
a
bitter
coffee
and
tabacco
character
the
finish
is
a
prickly
combo
from
the
burn
of
the
alcohol
and
some
hops
the
appearance
of
this
brew
is
about
top
notch
very
nice
clear
mahogony
with
a
14
head
that
hangs
around
and
provides
good
lacing
aroma
is
heavy
the
fruit
with
peaches
grapes
and
a
good
whiff
of
alcohol
actually
reminds
meof
westy12
a
bit
to
be
honest
the
similarities
dont
end
there
suprisingly
grape
taste
along
with
apple
pears
just
alot
of
fruit
the
malt
is
more
of
an
afterthought
to
this
onslaught
of
great
hoppy
fruit
flavors
this
suprised
the
hell
outta
me
mouthfeel
is
not
to
thick
with
a
light
foamy
ness
that
makes
for
a
great
drinkability
the
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
hands
down
i
am
sampling
a
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
the
brewery
pouring
into
a
snifter
at
cellar
temp
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
tightly
packed
creamy
eggshell
white
head
the
head
fades
quickly
to
an
edge
layer
aroma
is
caramel
and
red
grapes
mixing
with
mild
piney
hops
and
a
hint
of
ripe
pears
overall
i
dig
the
nose
first
sip
reveals
gentle
rolling
carbonation
with
a
thick
syrupy
body
that
leaves
a
pleasant
coating
on
my
tongue
flavor
is
malty
sweet
with
toffee
pears
and
maple
syrup
some
caramel
and
general
fruitiness
as
well
a
fairly
sweet
barleywine
that
i
enjoy
it
is
very
easy
and
smooth
to
drink
i
am
typically
a
big
fan
of
weyerbacher
brews
but
this
one
is
just
not
wowing
me
ill
let
the
other
age
and
try
it
in
a
year
or
two
pouring
into
a
tulip
glass
at
room
temp
it
pours
a
cherry
color
w
12
inch
of
white
frothy
that
dissipates
to
a
slight
surface
layer
and
a
difinitive
edge
layer
aroma
is
mainly
of
berries
and
alcohol
slight
carmelized
malts
found
also
but
not
overly
complex
great
aroma
however
taste
is
cherries
on
the
sip
and
a
feel
of
smooth
vanilla
full
bodied
some
sweet
chocolate
if
found
on
the
finish
carbonation
is
minimal
but
the
alcohol
whacks
ya
good
on
the
finish
along
with
the
chocolate
taste
makes
for
a
slightly
dry
experience
id
really
like
to
age
this
one
a
year
or
two
to
get
more
out
of
it
great
brew
drinkability

the
alcohol
doesnt
overwhelm
light
warming
close
pleasant
insanity
is
the
essentially
the
same
beer
with
more
flavor
and
its
worth
the
money
wont
be
buying
this
again
but
ill
have
one
if
you
give
it
to
me
pours
an
orangey
copper
color
with
a
quickfading
offwhite
head
a
fair
amount
of
fruity
esters
ranging
from
melon
to
fresh
fig
to
plum
lightly
biscuity
malt
profile
fusel
alcohols
are
at
a
moderate
level
some
flowery
hops
delicately
carbonated
initially
sweet
on
the
palate
it
has
an
odd
scorchy
flavor
like
raisins
sautéed
in
rum
in
the
middle
and
finishes
a
little
dry
from
the
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
certainly
not
a
bad
barleywine
just
not
my
favorite
i
seem
to
recall
liking
this
a
bit
more
when
it
first
came
out
im
making
it
a
barleywine
evening
tonight
next
on
the
list
is
blithering
idiot
picked
up
in
md
while
i
was
on
the
east
coast
for
the
holidays
when
i
crack
the
bottle
my
nose
is
greeted
by
rum
like
notes
of
alcohol
the
body
of
this
beer
is
visually
dense
and
hazy
and
a
garnetruby
brown
a
hearty
eggshell
head
forms
upon
pouring
but
receds
to
a
thin
frosting
on
top
with
a
crusting
around
the
outer
rim
of
the
pint
taking
a
whiff
of
this
beer
i
get
the
impression
that
this
is
more
of
an
english
style
barleywine
than
american
some
hoppiness
is
in
the
nose
but
it
is
dominated
by
rumsoaked
raisons
and
a
vinous
aroma
the
english
orientation
of
this
beer
is
confirmed
upon
tasting
telltale
flavors
of
rumsoaked
fruit
and
grapeskin
alongside
the
typical
malt
flavors
of
toffee
and
caramel
bitterness
levels
are
solid
for
the
style
the
hop
flavors
are
a
bit
more
subtle
though
i
do
pick
up
on
some
levels
of
piney
and
grapefruit
hop
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
great
perfectly
coating
a
great
barleywine
which
i
think
will
come
together
even
more
with
age
im
anxious
to
try
the
oakaged
version
now
lemon
and
orangey
citrus
zests
provide
a
nice
tartness
to
counter
the
malty
sweetness
warming
golden
rumlike
alcohol
bathes
the
throat
and
beyond
a
peppery
spiciness
is
noticed
throughout
but
more
so
in
the
finish
i
had
about
five
in
two
hours
great
flavor
makes
this
beer
deadly
drinkable
my
favorite
of
the
barleywines
ive
had
so
far
ive
seen
this
one
many
times
and
finally
picked
one
up
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
from
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
gets
most
of
its
character
from
the
dark
fruits
but
there
is
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
there
it
could
use
a
little
more
aging
at
least
the
one
i
had
good
beer
but
the
drinkability
suffers
from
the
unmasked
alcohol
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
potential
and
i
feel
that
with
a
little
tinkering
it
could
be
great
of
course
that
may
just
be
the
insanity
i
had
a
couple
days
ago
talking
this
beer
pours
a
nice
ruby
color
with
a
small
head
that
rings
the
beer
the
nose
is
dark
fruit
and
sweet
cherry
very
rich
and
full
the
flavor
is
a
blast
of
alcohol
up
front
mellowing
out
to
be
a
bit
of
fig
this
beer
is
a
bit
hot
the
feel
is
thick
almost
a
bit
syrupy
drinkability
suffers
from
the
alcohol
on
the
beer
after
having
the
insanity
this
is
much
less
mellow
than
the
aged
version
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
the
insanity
is
much
better
beer
is
good
happy
beering
i
urge
any
lovers
of
barleywine
to
pursue
this
one
buy
a
whole
case
about
3540
in
pa
and
cellar
them
drink
a
few
every
winter
and
enjoy
with
patience
this
bottle
was
nearly
6
years
old
was
the
best
ive
had
i
would
say
its
at
its
peak
but
could
still
go
a
few
years
too
cheers
this
offering
poured
with
a
light
brown
body
that
could
be
considered
as
having
a
slight
tint
of
orange
the
head
is
not
much
more
than
a
thin
layer
of
film
on
top
and
even
that
disappears
fairly
quickly
the
nose
is
intriguing
and
tempting
caramel
clove
and
a
candy
sweet
aroma
perk
the
senses
the
taste
has
a
quite
a
few
intermingling
flavors
id
say
the
overall
tone
is
set
by
a
brandylike
quality
but
it
is
surrounded
by
licorice
and
caramel
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
certainly
full
bodied
but
very
smooth
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
is
the
finish
all
those
pronounced
flavors
transform
into
almost
a
full
cocoa
feel
and
for
a
split
second
its
almost
like
youre
drinking
some
chocolate
milk
love
that
everything
is
tied
up
nicely
with
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
at
the
very
end
love
this
barleywine
highly
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
very
murky
and
dirty
looking
light
brown
tough
to
see
through
smells
like
wine
very
alcoholic
and
fruity
with
some
noticable
sweet
malts
something
about
this
taste
definately
says
english
style
rather
than
american
barley
wine
very
sweet
and
complex
with
lots
of
flavors
brandy
dried
fruits
definate
alcohol
taste
i
know
a
lot
of
people
frown
upon
this
in
beers
but
i
dont
really
find
anything
wrong
with
alcohol
taste
in
an
alcoholic
beverage
it
only
makes
sense
this
beer
could
use
more
of
a
hop
kick
that
would
make
it
great
as
of
now
its
just
passing
as
good
smooth
and
sticky
in
the
mouth
not
as
drinkable
because
of
the
abv
and
alcoholic
taste
but
a
fine
put
me
to
bed
on
a
slow
thursday
beer
night
night
folks
ruby
brown
body
no
head
decent
carbonation
cinnamon
and
spice
smell
but
very
faint
flavor
is
malty
up
front
with
a
red
wine
finish
a
little
caramel
in
the
middle
drinkability
is
average
the
red
wine
charactoristics
are
interesting
have
yet
to
experience
that
flavor
in
a
barleywine
berfore
the
aroma
is
much
like
a
red
wine
with
a
fruity
background
there
are
small
amounts
of
alcohol
in
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
at
first
like
wine
and
fairly
fruity
there
is
a
bit
of
apple
spice
and
a
mild
alcoholic
taste
as
well
the
label
did
not
give
an
abv
but
you
could
definitely
tell
it
was
there
pours
a
hazy
medium
copper
with
a
quickly
fading
light
tan
head
sweet
candy
and
spice
dominate
this
rich
smelling
beer
very
inviting
malty
sweetness
quite
strong
also
lots
of
malt
and
spice
control
the
palate
surprisingly
light
finish
mouthfeel
is
not
as
thick
as
i
was
expecting
somewhat
disappointing
wish
this
was
thicker
and
richer
than
it
is
smelled
like
it
would
be
much
more
flavorful
no
need
to
try
this
one
deep
amber
clear
with
a
rather
generous
head
offwhite
and
with
decent
lacing
but
dissipating
after
a
couple
of
seconds
mostly
malty
sweet
nose
but
not
as
rich
as
most
barley
wines
ive
had
it
consists
mainly
of
brown
sugar
and
vinous
fruits
plums
grapes
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
an
obvious
if
not
overwhelming
alcohol
presence
thinmedium
bodied
quite
smooth
with
a
tad
more
carbonation
than
usual
in
the
style
but
somehow
there
are
peaks
where
it
seems
a
little
boring
too
easy
going
and
just
not
particularly
captivating
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
light
tan
head
above
a
murky
orangeyamber
brew
head
is
not
particularly
longlasting
and
lacing
is
minimal
but
not
so
out
of
line
with
the
style
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
strong
alcohol
notes
taste
is
all
about
the
sweet
malts
with
strong
alcohol
at
the
outset
however
even
the
strong
alcohol
notes
in
this
case
arent
overpowering
even
for
such
a
high
abv
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
for
the
style
worth
a
try
for
a
barleywine
the
english
interpretation
gives
a
more
approachable
product
in
this
case
im
just
not
feelin
it
with
many
of
these
american
barley
wines
i
definitely
like
the
more
delicate
and
understated
english
versions
better
and
i
know
this
is
classified
as
english
style
but
its
not
like
the
ones
that
ive
had
this
pours
a
nice
maroon
color
with
a
thin
wispy
head
and
it
smells
incredibly
vinous
and
fruity
almost
like
raspberry
wine
the
taste
just
whacks
you
over
the
head
with
a
fruitiness
that
i
just
dont
like
its
sweet
and
juicy
and
the
actual
malt
sweetness
seems
lost
the
hops
are
strong
no
doubt
and
hit
your
palate
on
the
way
down
leaving
more
bitterness
than
flavor
drinkability
suffers
even
as
a
sipping
beverage
maybe
this
is
better
in
the
bottles
and
maybe
it
needs
to
be
at
room
temperature
but
this
just
isnt
for
me
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
nice
full
body
and
good
consistency
drinkability
is
good
as
well
but
after
a
few
of
these
youll
end
up
looking
like
the
joker
on
the
label
i
think
this
one
couldve
used
some
more
time
in
the
cellar
but
its
good
fresh
if
youre
looking
for
a
hoppier
taste
check
this
one
out
if
you
like
barleywines
thanks
to
ironically
enough
blitheringidiot
himself
for
the
chance
to
partake
opaque
burnt
orange
color
with
chunklets
suspended
thick
and
fine
beige
head
rises
up
a
full
inch
and
sinks
every
so
slowly
aroma
rises
up
from
the
glass
before
im
even
done
pouring
its
thick
and
rich
and
sweet
smelling
of
rich
malts
and
honey
plus
pear
and
apple
very
inviting
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
gives
way
to
a
wallop
of
pungent
flavor
pine
and
citrus
with
sweet
malts
and
fruit
riding
beneath
finish
is
an
alochol
burn
followed
by
a
lingering
tingle
that
full
11
makes
itself
known
and
probably
hides
many
other
interesting
flavors
that
would
normally
surface
a
great
example
of
barleywine
for
those
whove
never
had
one
before
poors
a
very
deep
rusty
color
with
hardly
any
head
the
nose
is
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
toffee
but
smells
mainly
of
liquor
which
is
definitly
acceptable
consider
the
alcohol
content
the
taste
is
out
of
this
world
ridiculously
complex
with
tastes
of
prunes
raisens
toffee
caramel
and
so
much
more
incredibly
smooth
for
how
potent
it
is
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
syrupy
but
not
at
all
in
a
bad
way
and
as
for
the
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
sipping
beer
that
will
get
you
tanked
enjoy
what
an
appropriate
name
for
a
barley
wine
definitely
fits
the
description
of
my
disposition
after
too
much
of
the
style
this
pours
out
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
tall
off
white
head
that
quickly
collapses
to
a
covering
of
foam
and
bubbles
the
aroma
is
filled
with
the
scent
of
sweet
ripe
fruit
joined
by
a
sharp
but
not
overpowering
scent
of
alcohol
sweet
malts
greet
the
tongue
first
with
fruit
flavors
and
molasses
the
finish
is
a
bit
tongue
numbing
with
alcohol
and
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
full
and
syrupy
will
sufficient
carbonation
this
takes
a
hit
on
drinkability
from
the
alcohol
taste
that
numbs
my
tongue
i
dare
not
have
another
one
or
i
might
not
be
able
to
feel
my
tongue
at
all
fresh
i
dont
care
too
much
for
it
but
i
will
have
to
age
a
bottle
of
this
and
see
how
it
turns
out
if
the
alcohol
mellows
this
could
turn
into
something
much
better
pours
a
dark
copper
with
little
to
no
head
smell
is
fairly
sweet
and
malty
with
notes
toffee
and
liquor
soaked
dark
fruits
are
also
on
the
nose
taste
is
a
bit
thin
for
something
this
potent
rich
malt
and
toffee
with
more
brandied
fruits
on
the
tongue
alcohol
is
disguised
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
however
with
almost
a
cotton
candy
type
feeling
drinkability
isnt
bad
however
i
can
think
of
several
other
barleywines
i
would
rather
have
a
go
at
i
like
this
very
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
deliciously
sweet
earthy
very
nice
best
of
the
weyerbachers
ive
had
not
a
bad
barley
wine
but
not
something
i
would
make
a
habit
of
buying
definitely
a
brew
with
great
cellar
potential
its
nice
to
have
one
now
to
see
a
fresh
sample
but
ill
be
waiting
until
winter
before
reaching
for
the
next
one
in
the
6pack
and
im
looking
forward
to
it
already
this
was
one
of
the
guest
taps
at
5
seasons
in
atlanta
for
the
july
1
celebration
yay
bigger
beer
a
very
nice
barleywine
and
one
that
i
think
is
better
for
the
style
than
the
wimpy
for
style
old
heathen
this
is
on
the
dark
side
of
the
brown
specturm
wiht
an
ok
head
its
got
that
big
barleywine
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
backed
up
with
a
healthy
does
of
sweet
malt
and
leafy
grassy
hops
the
caramellike
malt
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
blends
nicely
with
the
dates
and
fig
fruitiness
note
i
think
this
one
needs
some
time
to
mature
at
least
i
hope
thats
the
explanation
ive
set
aside
a
few
and
will
review
again
at
a
later
point
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
this
barley
wine
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
have
had
it
several
times
but
i
decided
to
wait
to
review
a
bottle
from
last
winter
that
has
had
time
to
sit
it
is
more
mature
but
still
not
great
the
appearance
is
a
brown
cloudy
mix
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
is
very
fruity
likes
raisins
and
dates
the
taste
is
pretty
much
raisins
and
dates
that
is
the
only
way
i
can
describe
this
the
only
other
way
is
to
say
that
it
is
like
drinking
a
fig
newton
the
alcohol
is
strong
but
it
isnt
very
drinkable
definitey
a
onedimensional
barley
wine
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
very
little
carbonation
present
smell
is
kind
of
winey
with
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
perhaps
it
would
benefit
from
more
aging
i
found
it
to
be
too
sweet
hops
are
hardly
present
leaning
towards
a
big
malty
taste
not
a
bad
barleywine
but
at
the
price
of
15
for
a
6
pack
i
found
it
somewhat
disappointing
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
due
to
the
sweetness
which
i
found
to
be
rather
overbearing
cheers
bought
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
case
from
the
brewery
this
is
definately
a
high
power
brew
pours
a
clear
brownish
red
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
smell
is
fruity
malt
and
alcohol
but
its
not
overpowering
taste
is
like
dark
dried
fruit
with
very
sweet
malt
and
very
warm
alcohol
has
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
flavors
are
very
ripe
and
agressive
definately
a
sipping
beer
id
like
to
try
this
one
with
a
little
age
this
has
a
big
malty
backbone
with
a
faint
plum
flavor
that
quickly
gives
way
to
an
astringent
flavor
that
leaves
a
nice
dry
mouth
and
little
after
taste
each
sip
is
a
little
warming
and
although
there
is
a
little
alcohol
flavor
its
not
overpowering
but
this
could
sit
down
in
the
cellar
pretty
well
and
hopefully
tame
down
some
of
the
tannic
qualities
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
barley
wine
by
any
means
not
as
complex
as
ive
had
but
this
is
pretty
green
pours
out
a
hazy
orangish
color
and
yeast
floaties
are
in
there
as
well
and
eventually
settle
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
medium
off
white
head
almost
tan
and
thins
out
aroma
is
of
alcohol
raisons
alcohol
some
weak
malt
alcohol
figs
alcohol
a
bit
of
spicey
hops
and
did
i
mention
the
alcohol
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
alcohol
and
more
alcohol
and
very
little
of
all
else
very
chewy
and
full
bodied
also
cause
of
the
noticeable
alcohol
there
is
a
warming
everytime
you
take
a
sip
this
could
with
out
a
doubt
sit
in
a
dark
corner
for
at
least
a
year
to
develop
into
a
less
alcohol
more
flavorful
beer
at
least
i
believe
with
a
year
on
the
bench
it
can
mellow
out
a
little
pours
with
a
twofinger
light
brown
head
that
fades
very
slowly
and
leaves
a
gobs
of
lace
cloudy
amber
color
good
carbonation
nose
is
alcohol
starts
with
a
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
finishes
fairly
smooth
but
the
alcohol
is
there
in
the
background
2
75
for
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
an
intense
malty
scent
that
seems
to
scream
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
there
is
little
hop
aroma
here
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
thick
malt
flavor
that
warms
on
the
way
down
it
is
very
flavorful
and
smooth
there
seems
to
be
little
hop
qualities
to
it
but
the
malt
complexity
makes
up
for
any
lacking
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
as
smooth
a
barleywine
as
ive
had
it
warms
you
up
but
it
also
leaves
behind
a
very
good
malt
palate
aftertaste
this
drinks
very
well
redish
pour
slight
head
hops
are
pretty
much
just
background
noise
i
only
bought
a
single
the
price
being
a
little
steep
a
good
barleywine
but
not
one
that
jumps
out
at
you
more
mild
than
wild
a
good
drinking
beer
except
for
the
abv
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
color
and
is
topped
by
a
creamy
tan
head
smells
of
sticky
malts
with
a
bit
of
candy
type
sweetness
to
it
there
is
some
alcohol
in
the
nose
as
well
as
a
bit
of
hop
aromatics
up
front
this
barley
wine
has
a
nice
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
this
beer
is
sweetish
but
it
has
a
nice
balancing
hop
flavor
that
is
subtle
for
an
american
but
it
is
pronounced
enough
that
it
is
quite
pleasing
the
alcohol
is
not
as
evident
in
the
taste
which
is
good
there
is
a
bit
of
astringency
in
the
finish
some
fermentation
by
products
esters
higher
alcohols
etc
these
really
dont
take
away
from
this
beer
though
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
barley
wine
that
has
a
bunch
of
subtle
competing
flavors
that
keep
this
interesting
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
for
sending
me
this
along
with
a
750
of
golden
monkey
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
medium
ruby
red
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
well
balanced
between
sweet
malt
and
juicy
hops
there
is
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
smell
as
well
the
taste
starts
malty
with
some
caramel
and
honey
in
there
the
finish
ends
with
snappy
hops
and
a
touch
of
ethanol
a
fairly
well
balanced
barley
wine
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
yet
smooth
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
a
little
low
mainly
due
to
the
high
alcohol
this
beer
can
only
get
better
with
age
thanks
to
beerluvr
and
pbrian
for
sending
me
some
to
sample
and
age
12oz
bottle
no
freshness
date
clear
copper
colored
with
a
thick
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
film
some
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
fresh
barley
some
fruit
and
noticable
alcohol
nice
smooth
full
body
flavor
is
malty
and
sweet
with
lots
of
fruit
unfortunately
alcohol
adds
an
unpleasant
tatse
warm
finish
and
overall
a
good
barley
wine
i
just
wish
the
alcohol
were
masked
better
this
is
its
only
fault
in
my
opinion
this
could
be
a
good
beer
if
it
is
aged
properly
for
a
year
or
2
it
is
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
fruit
in
the
nose
it
is
complex
but
the
alcohol
takes
control
of
your
mouth
there
is
an
excessive
pepperiness
to
it
it
definitley
needs
to
mellow
for
some
time
and
then
maybe
it
will
be
more
enjoyable
the
flavor
is
a
warm
balance
of
alcohol
spices
and
a
complex
array
of
fruits
parts
of
it
have
a
taste
i
attribute
to
scotch
this
beer
remains
beautifully
uncarbonated
and
brings
out
the
smooth
thick
body
of
this
beer
the
complex
flavors
do
a
good
job
both
hiding
the
high
abv
and
supporting
the
enjoyable
moments
of
alcohol
taste
strong
brew
no
doubt
coppery
appearance
with
a
nice
head
smell
was
malty
with
some
definite
fruity
presence
sweet
initially
with
a
midtaste
kick
in
of
alcohol
very
winelike
at
the
finish
a
definite
sipper
high
alcohol
presence
that
wasnt
mellowed
affected
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
ive
always
felt
this
was
an
averagetasting
barleywine
having
little
of
the
hop
complexity
and
fine
malt
of
other
britishstyled
barleywines
old
horizontal
millenium
etc
compared
to
the
scions
of
the
style
like
j
w
lees
or
bigfoot
you
can
understand
why
i
say
average
the
kind
you
can
shut
your
brain
off
to
its
shallow
but
decent
sweetness
a
fine
example
of
an
american
style
barleywine
somewhat
hazy
ruby
in
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
a
bit
of
figgy
fruitiness
taste
is
nice
malty
sweet
at
the
start
with
a
fruity
flavor
that
seems
almost
tropical
light
despite
the
dark
tones
suggested
by
the
aroma
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
big
spicy
alcohol
finish
well
hopped
enough
to
avoid
being
cloying
with
a
nicely
roasty
aftertaste
a
little
harsh
at
first
but
goes
down
nicely
after
the
alcohol
numbs
the
tastebuds
a
bit
full
bodied
a
different
kind
of
session
beer
in
that
i
could
sip
one
savoring
it
as
it
warms
and
grows
in
complexity
two
of
these
warming
brews
could
make
a
nightime
session
half
this
sixer
is
going
in
my
cellar
weyerbacher
just
started
showing
up
around
here
and
its
becoming
a
favorite
brewer
of
mine
a
fellow
ba
john
treated
me
to
one
of
these
potent
puppies
at
the
rochester
ba
gathering
this
past
weekend
held
at
the
intown
macgregors
grill
and
tap
room
see
beerfly
review
this
was
the
perfect
brew
to
cap
off
an
evening
of
warm
comraderie
before
we
all
headed
out
into
the
deep
subzero
chill
of
an
upstate
new
york
winter
night
it
poured
a
glistening
deep
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
and
as
soon
as
i
imbibed
its
powerful
and
sweet
aroma
i
knew
i
would
be
deliciously
sipping
this
for
a
while
and
i
was
right
the
alcohol
content
is
not
equivocal
but
it
did
not
oppress
the
nutty
malts
and
the
floral
esters
an
hour
later
i
was
still
happily
meandering
my
way
through
this
barley
wine
content
to
enjoy
any
excuse
to
hang
out
and
talk
beer
hence
high
drinkability
update
i
cant
believe
that
its
been
seven
years
since
i
last
had
this
bw
but
now
that
ive
moved
back
to
the
midwest
i
was
able
to
find
it
in
a
local
beer
store
its
a
lot
less
sugary
than
i
noted
on
my
original
review
and
i
thought
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
more
prominent
but
otherwise
a
terrific
sipper
pours
a
burgandy
amber
with
a
minimalist
caramel
colored
head
quickly
recedes
to
a
small
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
chalice
smells
quite
smoky
and
medicinal
the
tatse
is
a
big
rush
of
leathery
malt
with
a
bit
of
that
smoky
afterhue
definitely
has
some
grape
and
unripened
apple
that
borders
on
the
cusp
of
an
acidic
twang
ends
quite
medicinally
with
a
hint
of
that
alcohol
halfmasked
by
the
malt
not
really
balanced
not
really
great
i
have
another
that
ill
let
sit
until
next
winter
time
can
only
help
this
one
not
my
favorite
but
it
aint
tooo
bad
but
it
is
still
has
some
way
to
go
overall
drinkability
is
i
want
another
one
but
i
know
i
shouldnt
have
one
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
fruity
feel
the
alcohol
is
quite
noticable
and
could
maybe
be
too
present
it
outweighs
any
other
aspect
of
the
brew
the
mouthfeel
isnt
very
pleasant
a
good
beer
to
start
the
night
out
with
as
long
as
you
plan
on
going
all
the
way
the
alcohol
is
not
masked
very
well
and
that
hurts
the
drinkability
but
the
flavor
is
quite
good
this
doesnt
top
my
list
of
barleywines
bigfoot
avery
hog
heaven
but
its
pretty
tasty
deep
clear
amber
nice
head
smell
is
malty
sweet
with
hints
of
banana
and
blatantly
obvious
alcohol
burnt
flavor
with
plenty
of
alcohol
a
bit
sweet
almost
makes
your
tongue
numb
and
certainly
does
the
same
to
the
rest
of
your
body
if
you
choose
to
have
more
than
a
couple
drinkability
a
less
hoppy
barleywine
is
a
refreshing
change
it
has
kind
of
a
weird
mouthfeel
you
expected
a
really
heavy
creamy
texture
but
i
find
it
thin
with
not
enough
body
it
is
a
very
strong
beer
that
reminds
you
of
that
from
beginning
to
end
i
find
this
maybe
the
weakest
effort
from
the
brewer
of
what
ive
tried
it
could
be
a
beer
before
its
time
since
the
carbonation
was
so
low
looking
back
it
was
definitely
worth
the
money
i
should
be
able
to
find
it
cheaper
around
here
in
south
jersey
the
brewery
is
only
1
5
hours
away
big
thanks
to
twelvevoltman
for
the
bottle
id
surely
like
to
try
it
again
and
thank
jcalbi
for
my
first
taste
thanks
to
twelvevoltman
for
this
one
color
is
very
opaque
chestnut
brown
dark
with
barely
a
glow
fluffy
finger
high
head
of
light
tan
hue
which
slowly
fades
down
to
a
thin
haze
on
top
and
a
thick
sticky
ring
around
the
edge
lace
is
in
thin
sheets
aroma
is
mostly
dark
and
fruity
with
plum
raisin
melon
banana
starfruit
and
toffee
slight
alcoholic
note
taste
follows
suit
with
slight
dark
fruit
senses
of
raisin
plum
and
a
touch
of
banana
malts
are
chewy
in
the
toffee
with
slight
dark
caramel
quite
smooth
and
creamy
all
the
way
through
with
some
nicely
done
slight
piney
and
dried
hop
bitterness
that
enters
in
very
subtle
just
after
the
midway
point
and
gains
some
depth
into
the
finish
with
some
added
malty
thick
depth
as
well
feel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
couple
hollow
areas
some
uneven
texured
velevtyness
and
not
quite
as
hefty
or
strongly
flavored
as
i
like
the
alcohol
in
this
starts
to
hit
pretty
quick
though
so
its
a
major
sipper
and
a
good
one
at
that
aging
this
may
help
we
will
see
as
i
acquired
a
few
bottles
from
pabobcat
whom
i
thank
greatly
for
the
bottles
had
this
on
tap
at
the
spring
house
drafting
roompoured
a
medium
brown
with
some
amber
tones
with
a
light
but
somewhat
creamy
headaroma
was
of
burnt
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
was
very
rasiny
and
of
dried
fruit
definently
sweet
and
chewy
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
pretty
nice
brew
i
think
the
best
i
have
had
from
weyerbacher
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
though
the
fact
that
its
pretty
moderate
in
all
aspects
of
its
barelywineness
leaves
me
with
little
impression
besides
that
its
less
than
impressive
awesome
stuff
and
worth
the
12
i
paid
for
a
sixer
what
a
great
name
for
a
beer
id
like
this
much
more
if
the
alcohol
was
toned
down
a
bit
and
not
turned
all
the
way
up
to
11
its
hard
to
make
a
dreadful
barleywine
though
perhaps
ive
just
not
tried
enough
of
them
this
is
a
solid
and
respectable
example
of
the
style
taste
its
a
nice
simple
straightforward
if
there
is
such
a
thing
barleywine
it
has
a
nice
flavor
but
it
doesnt
try
to
be
over
the
top
it
was
enjoyable
carbonation
gives
a
little
bite
at
first
and
it
then
dies
to
make
the
mouthfeel
smooth
and
rich
very
sweet
flavors
of
fruits
and
caramel
there
is
some
bitterness
but
well
below
the
level
i
would
expect
the
body
is
all
there
just
a
little
bit
below
what
i
would
call
full
the
flavor
is
big
but
just
unproportioned
with
a
lot
of
sweets
it
is
a
nice
drinkable
brew
but
i
want
a
barley
wine
to
punch
me
in
the
face
with
aroma
and
flavor
i
guess
in
the
end
it
is
a
good
beer
but
could
use
some
work
as
far
as
being
a
barleywine
this
brew
is
dark
amber
with
a
medium
thick
offwhite
head
thin
lacing
in
patches
all
the
way
down
the
side
of
the
glass
strong
caramel
aroma
with
a
little
fruit
rich
body
with
a
lot
of
caramel
and
malt
in
the
flavor
it
is
pretty
hard
to
hide
that
high
an
abv
but
this
beer
does
a
pretty
good
job
the
alcohol
flavor
is
not
very
strong
the
alcohol
is
sweet
up
front
and
gets
progressively
more
spicey
throughout
this
is
a
very
good
beer
as
i
discovered
when
trying
the
beer
again
it
was
totally
unbalanced
the
word
best
used
to
describe
it
would
be
raw
i
have
a
couple
that
i
am
going
to
age
and
see
if
anything
turns
out
different
this
years
batch
so
im
probably
sampling
this
too
young
but
i
cant
resist
any
longer
more
mellow
than
i
expected
under
the
circumstances
fruity
esters
riding
on
bright
caramel
malt
flavors
a
bit
sweet
at
the
front
but
the
hops
and
alcohol
flavors
collide
at
the
finish
in
an
effort
at
reigning
the
sweetness
in
quite
smooth
a
very
nice
nightcap
f
carbonation
i
think
not
the
pour
was
reminiscent
of
mud
or
dirty
dirty
thick
water
at
the
least
that
is
to
say
it
looked
nice
no
head
due
to
the
extreme
lack
of
carbonation
wonderful
aroma
of
dark
fruits
and
candy
candylike
sweetness
in
the
flavor
as
well
very
malty
chocolate
cherry
and
a
mildly
hoppy
finish
balances
this
brew
out
well
the
11
abv
is
nearly
hidden
completely
alcohol
is
only
slightly
detectable
in
the
flavor
great
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
a
sweet
candylike
treat
of
a
barleywine
all
in
all
the
blithering
idiot
was
fair
but
nothing
much
to
write
home
about
perhaps
it
could
mature
into
something
good
but
at
this
point
i
probably
wouldnt
have
another
brilliant
copper
color
topped
by
a
tan
head
an
impressive
head
for
a
barleywine
wonderful
malty
aroma
sweet
and
beautiful
very
sweet
taste
thick
caramel
strong
dark
fruits
finished
off
by
a
nice
hoppiness
this
is
an
exceptional
fresh
barleywine
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
as
expected
but
it
is
also
creamy
with
the
carbonation
lightening
the
load
on
the
tongue
and
sweeping
away
the
sweetness
on
the
finish
the
drinkability
is
good
good
enough
to
turn
you
into
a
blithering
idiot
in
short
order
i
am
impressed
by
this
beer
this
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
red
amber
color
and
formed
a
huge
foamy
off
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
some
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
grapes
with
a
slight
wine
aspect
to
it
a
flavor
of
malt
caramel
and
chocolate
a
warming
aspect
of
the
alcohol
present
is
apparent
in
the
medium
body
smooth
finish
this
beer
could
use
some
aging
but
is
not
a
bad

i
chilled

it
could
have
aged
some
more

it
was
a

harsh

a
bit

with
a
rediculous
amount

blithering

is

its

masked

nonetheless
its
an
enjoyable
brew
aroma
was
ripe
fruit
alcohol
sweet
apple
figs
plums
and
fumes
of
alcohol
started
out
with
a

the

joining
the
fray
somewhere
way
in

a

raised
its

for
recognition
by
the

but
it
was
never
recognized
by
the
floor
so
it
left
the
meeting
with
reserved
bitterness
the
alcohol
remained
well
in
check
until
it
hit
mid
sip
and
bellowed
loudly
but
briefly
the
finish
was
sweet
sugary
alcoholic
but
not
at
all
cloying
with
a
lingering
toffee
apple
aftertaste
hugely
drinkable
for
its

dark

i
could

identify
a

easily
hazelnuts
slight
cinamon
wood
fruit
flavors
really
start
to
come
out
as
the
beer
approaches

temperature
alcohol
has
a
nice

quality
and
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
but
not
does
not
dominate
the
flavor
profile
overall
a
nice
and
interesting
barley
wine
pours
a
reddish

copper
color
with
a
tan
head
on

huge
sweet
aromas
of

the
palate
the
aromas

be
tasted
figs
alcohol
spice
sweetness
caramel
and
dark

there
is
a
warming
in
the
gut
i
think
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
out
of
control
on
this
oneits
possible
i
need
to
let
one
age
overall
not
bad
for
a
style
that
i
dont
care
for
much
pours
a
slightly
hazy
rubyamber
with
a
nice
looking
creamy
tan
head
that
faded
to
a
nice
lasting
film
on
top
of
the
brew
nice
creamy
malt
aromas
are
accompanied
by
some
spicy
alcohol
smelss
as
well
sweet
caramel
maltiness
is
mixed
well
with
some
subtle
fruity
flavors
and
nice
vinous
qualities
the
brew
gets
a
little
woody
towards
the
end
before
the
spicy
alcohol
picks
up
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
rather
subtle
but
provides
some
nice
background
flavor
as
more
graperaisin
flavors
finish
the
brew
the
brew
is
smooth
but
a
little
thinner
than
i
like
a
bw
to
be
for
the
alcohol
content
this
is
one
damn
drinkable
brew
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
drinking
this
one
the
reviews
up
until
recently
had
not
been
very
good
but
i
definintely
liked
this
on
even
older
bottles
of
this
seem
to
pour
hazy
im
not
sure
of
the
year
since
they
dont
mark
them
but
this
is
the
older
label
burgundy
w
gold
letters
just
letters
no
jester
so
it
must
be
at
least
a
year
old
maybe
two
its
aged
well
no
defects
the
color
has
a
nice
organge
cast
to
it
and
the
aroma
is
pretty
bold
very
full
sweet
caramelish
malt
no
hops
in
the
aroma
but
thats
expected
for
an
englishstyle
barleywine
the
flavor
however
is
much
more
restrained
than
the
malt
suggests
alot
of
drinkers
view
this
in
a
negative
light
but
i
feel
its
perfectly
acceptable
its
not
as
malty
or
hoppy
as
most
american
versions
but
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
based
on
british
barleywines
many
of
which
are
more
along
these
lines
the
flavor
that
is
here
is
very
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
rounding
up
the
usual
suspects
malty
toffee
brown
sugar
dark
fruits
alcohol
not
alot
of
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
but
just
enough
to
balance
very
well
i
think
this
is
also
a
beer
best
served
englishstyle
at
a
cellar
temperature
of
50
55
f
as
more
of
its
character
is
revealed
a
bit
of
an
underdog
in
the
barleywine
race
but
still
an
excellent
beer
thanks
to
davo
for
the
sample
the
tides
are
turning
in
favor
of
weyerbacher
based
on
reading
the
other
reviews
im
inclined
to
believe
that
ive
drawn
a
bad
sixpack
the
bottles
pour
like
wet
trub
rather
than
beer
nearly
saturated
with
yeast
and
i
believe
flecks
of
hop
petals
zero
head
and
zero
carbonation
smells
intensely
of
alcohol
tastes
of
syrupy
sweet
malt
and
yeast
alcohol
presence
is
dominating
the
bottles
i
bought
are
irrevocably
flawed
however
id
be
willing
to
try
this
beer
again
in
the
hopes
that
this
was
a
onetime
quality
control
oversight
sweet
mother
of
pearl
this
is
a
sweet
beer
and
by
sweet
i
mean
sweet
ruby
brown
color
with
almost
no
appreciable
head
smells
and
tastes
of
brown
sugar
dates
figs
prunes
and
alcohol
strong
alcohol
finish
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
less
refined
version
of
some
of
the
better
english
barley
wines
thomas
hardys
ale
for
instance
not
bad
though
not
a
beer
you
can
drink
more
than
one
of
for
sure
upon
further
research
and
palate
refinement
i
have
to
downgrade
this
beer
six
months
in
the
cellar
and
a
steady
diet
of
victory
and
sierra
nevada
barleywines
lessened
my
enthusiasm
for
blithering
idiot
way
too
sweet
and
lacking
the
complexity
of
the
best
of
the
style
soso
for
a
barleywine
but
nevertheless
it
is
still
a
quality
beer
i
would
consider
it
a
barleywine
that
is
not
quite
ready
to
drink
but
could
be
good
in
time
notes
not
aged
enough
to
quell
the
huge
alcohol
character
hops
are
lost
alcohol
seems
a
bit
out
of
control
this
is
still
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
it
shows
you
that
it
is
a
strong
brew
without
a
doubt
if
you
have
a
bottle
of
this
dont
drink
it
yet
wait
another
year
or
so
a
darn
good
barleywine
i
would
be
headoverheels
for
this
if
i
had
never
tasted
smuttynose
barleywine
but
this
ale
can
hold
its
own
perhaps
a
little
too
fruity
to
be
picky
you
should
drink
this
ale
in
a
comfortable
chair
as
you
certainly
wont
be
going
anywhere
soon
perhaps
as
much
oak
on
this
beer
as
on
any
i
have
ever
had
its
really
good
a
lot
better
than
it
looks
almost
milky
super
cloudy
yeasty
in
the
glass
without
much
head
at
all
the
smell
is
way
more
oak
than
bourbon
although
i
do
get
some
vanilla
notes
and
some
sweetness
the
grain
is
pretty
straight
forward
caramelized
long
boil
sweet
wort
aromas
dried
dates
english
ale
yeast
the
flavor
is
a
lot
like
the
nose
just
a
little
less
intense
ont
the
wood
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
much
more
pronounced
marshmallow
and
coconut
notes
come
in
nutty
for
a
second
but
quite
sweet
candy
like
for
awhile
and
then
the
wood
weird
to
think
about
drinking
a
solid
object
like
a
tree
trunk
but
thats
how
this
beer
feels
to
me
its
yeast
too
but
not
overly
so
it
gets
boozy
as
it
warms
but
i
think
this
is
pretty
excellent
barleywine
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
unique
enough
to
stand
out
thanks
to
thebrewo
for
leaving
this
one
at
my
house
well
done
this
one
is
remarkably
smooth
for
the
high
abv
i
havent
had
a
beer
quite
like
it
the
barrel
aging
seems
to
take
a
bit
of
the
edge
off
the
barley
wine
i
will
be
going
back
for
more
o
much
easier
to
drink
than
i
expected
for
the
style
and
strength
of
this
beer
very
enjoyable
with
really
nice
bourbon

flavors
and
aromas

with

this
is
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
special
i
split
one
with
a
buddy
he
hated
it
but
i
liked
it
a
lot
pours
a
deep
cloudy
copper
with
a
thinner
light
tan
head
that
burns
off
relatively
quickly
a
little
bit
hangs
on
to
leave
some
small
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
takes
some
time
to
open
up
bringing
out
the
deep
malts
and
dark
fruit
notes
and
just
a
hint
of
vanillin
the
body
though
brings
the
oakaging
upfront
backed
up
by
the
caramel
and
fruit
sweetness
the
oak
isnt
overwhelming
but
it
is
the
first
thing
i
taste
the
body
has
a
nice
thickness
to
it
with
a
nice
smooth
finish

got
to
get
some
more
to
cellar
drink
by
date
4
years
after
bottling
this
is
a
beautifully
done
barreled
barleywine
plenty
of
the
usual
english
barleywine
characteristics
but
none
of
the
cloying
offputting
sweetness
i
found
in
blithering
idiot
its
time
in
the
barrel
was
wellspent
as
the
smokey
wood
and
slightly
boozy
heat
add
a
layer
of
complexity
that
pairs
perfectly
with
the
rich
malty
backbone
its
a
sipper
for
sure
and
a
damn
good
one
cant
wait
to
see
what
a
year
in
the
cellar
does
for
this
one
b
3
48
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
a
lot
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
an
english
style
barleywine
and
while
i
wish
the
oak
showed
up
a
little
more
the
aspects
that
did
show
up
worked
well
with
this
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
the
alcohol
could
have
been
hidden
just
a
little
better
a
little
crisp
sticky
a
little
warming
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
anymore
than
that
and
i
think
the
sweetness
and
booze
would
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
is
its
just
what
i
expect
from
an
english
barleywine
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
that
the
oak
barrels
didnt
show
up
just
a
little
more
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
like
to
see
how
it
changes
overtime
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
especially
if
you
like
big
and
malty
barleywines
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
i
wasnt
sure
how
this
one
was
going
to
turn
out
but
i
had
high
hopes
and
in
the
end
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
i
think
its
a
good
beer
and
im
happy
to
be
able
to
buy
it
now
so
far
its
one
of
my
favorite
weyerbacher
beers
and
its
above
average
for
the
style
good
job
guys
this
is
one
tasty
barleywine
keep
up
the
hard
work
o
powerful
malty
goodness
which
becomes
more
bourbon
dominated
as
it
is
consumed
ends
up
being
quite
competitive
with
backwoods
bastard
my
favorite
ale
or
beer
for
any
day
that
ends
in
y
perfect
balance
of
bourbon
for
my
taste
strong
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
anyone
considering
this
beer
should
read
the
label
on
stones
arrogant
bastard
your
not
worthy
very
good
barley
wine
with
nice
bourbon
flavor
too
much
for
me
alcohol
is
clearly
present
underwhelming
not
much
oak
taste
and
the
smell
is
very
minimal
feel
silky
with
very
little
carbonation
fullbodied
and
pleasant
like
the
taste
reminiscent
of
bourbon
overall
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
the
oaking
gives
it
a
nice
vanilla
note
that
mixes
well
with
it
a
definite
must
have
on
your
drink
list
on
tap
for
3
a
glass
very
hazy
caramel
color
sweet
slightly
boozy
bourbon
aroma
taste
was
very
sweet
pretty
tasty
good
amount
of
sweet
grain
comes
through
lots
of
booze
taste
reminds
me
of
a
small
version
of
central
waters
bourbon
barrel
barley
wine
poured
into
snifter
beautiful
honey
color
light
head
and
lacing
very
pleasant
smell
vanilla
butterscotch
and
caramel
with
distinct
bourbon
when
sipped
the
first
taste
is
the
bourbon
followed
by
the
sweet
combination
of
caramel
vanilla
and
cherry
then
the
alcohol
burn
hits
there
is
a
pleasant
thickness
almost
like
drinking
a
cordial
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
barleywine
the
oak
aging
definitely
improves
the
blithering
idiot
ill
certainly
add
this
to
my
regular
selection
of
beers
indeed
a
contender
on
the
aged
ale
trail
style
final
word
thick
and
huge
delicious
desert
ale
smash
your
favorite
malted
brownie
topped
with
caramel
and
dipped
in
a
nice
whiskey
then
cram
it
down
your
throat
with
force
as
you
numb
your
head
and
smile
and
say
boozely

the

the

really
up

for

taste

everything

is
wanting
a
bit
not

smells
mostly
of
bourbon
and
mouthfeel
is
kinda
flat
fortunately
taste
carries
it
enough
to
make
it

overall
overall
impression
while
getting
into

lately
this
one

profile

is

it
is
insane
like
the
label
says
and
get
your
hands
on
this
one
as
soon
as
possible
very
rich
and

oaky
and

flavored

wouldnt
a
6pack
of
this
o
im

i
picked
up
a
4
of
this
on
all
the
bas
suggestions
this
is
a
damn
fine
barleywine
score
1
for
weyerbacher
pours
a
hazy
brown
so
hazy
in
that
it
is
nearly
opaque
save
for
the
edges
of
the
glass
a
fingersbreadth
of
foamy
creamcolored
head
rises
and
lingers
for
nearly
a
minute
before
settling
down
into
a
ring
and
a
central
patch
of
bubbles
smells
of
toffee
hazelnut
caramel
oak
and
faint
dark
fruit
raisin
in
particular
tastes
of
toffee

brown
sugar
some
raisin
and
date
and
a
faint
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
rear
as
it
warms
a
vanilla
presence
becomes
detectable
but
the
alcohol
also
makes
itself
more
prominent
mouthfeel
is
rich
but
only
medium
in
body
as
the
carbonation
and
alcohol
serve
to
thin
it
nicely
finish
is
a
touch
dry
overall
a
great
barleywine
now
and
i
have
high
hopes
for
the
ones
stashed
away
i
am
very
happy
i
was
able
to
try
this
guy
and
would
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
style
o
great
beer
that
i
am
enjoying
thoroughly
at
this
moment
very
complex
and
flavorful
very
well
crafted
and
delicious
brew
thanks
to
arniepnminne
for
this
great
treat
deceptively
smooth
for
its
abv
as
youd
expect
this
beer
is
big
and
sweet
but
its
dang
drinkable
o
a
really
pleasant
beer
considering
its
so
boozy
and
one
i
could
see
aging
for
a
short
period
to
try
and
mesh
all
the
wonderful
flavors
together
caramel
malt
oak
booze
sweetness
fruit
characteristics
right
now
its
a
good
sipper
and
better
than
almost
every
other
english
barleywine
and
old
ale
ive
ever
tried
o
overall
i
think
this
is
really
a
great
beer
not
too
far
behind
abacus
in
the
bbbw
category
great
job
weyerbacher
this
is
actually
my
first
english
barleywine
if
this
offering
is
standard
for
the
style
i
think
ive
found
myself
a
new
favorite
this
is
an
outstanding
offering
by
weyerbacher
for
the
past
week
and
a
half
ive
had
beers
that
have
done
nothing
but
disappoint
so
i
am
so
happy
to
finally
have
something
that
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
from
start
to
finish
i
cant
wait
to
trade
for
more
bottles
great
flavor
but
it
sits
very
heavy
on
the
palate
and
stomach
alcohol
is
well
incorporated
with
the
taste
nothing
is
overpowering
but
its
overall
a
heavy
barleywine
making
it
a
tough
decision
whether
its
a
fantastic
beer
or
just
a
plain
ol
great
beer
sarcastic
it
was
certainly
a
great
compliment
especially
in
name
to
go
with
the
end
of
the
4th
season
of
dexter
well
ive
had
blithering
idiot
several
times
but
i
always
had
a
hard
time
pulling
the
trigger
on
insanity
which
is
the
more
expernsive
oakaged
version
it
pours
a
thick
hazy
brownish
color
into
my
glass
a
small
head
disappears
fairly
quickly
man
this
smells
great
i
get
some
oaknatch
along
with
some
malty
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
smooth
even
though
its
followed
by
a
slight
alcohol
burn
nice
stuff
i
really
like
weyerbacher
along
with
victory
and
troegs
pa
has
some
awesome
beers
glad
i
live
nearby
overall
try
this
one
you
wont
know
what
your
missing
until
you
do
it
has
an
11
abv
so
one
is
all
youll
need
to
go
with
a
sirloin
or
a
filet
mignon
potatoes
and
a
citrus
fruit
laden
salad
with
bitter
greens
and
a
raspberry
vinegrette
i
opened
this
one
cooking
the
above
and
finished
it
at
supper
i
was
not
disapointed
i
will
revisit
it
often
well
done
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
deep
apple
cider
color
little
to
no
head
which
lasts
merely
seconds
aroma
of
grapes
tart
fruits
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
very
much
like
white
wine
strong
sticky
toffee
flavor
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
some
tart
fruit
flavor
as
well
as
the
beer
warms
these
initial
flavors
fade
to
the
back
and
the
beer
is
dominated
by
big
cherry
vanilla
and
bourbon
barrel
notes
this
beer
poured
in
a
snifter
from
on
high
generates
a
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
and
leave
a
light
ring
around
the
glass
the
color
is
a
dark
amber
but
not
hazy
or
cloudy
whoa
bourbon
big
time
on
the
nose
it
really
smells
like
i
put
a
12
shot
of
bourbon
in
my
barleywine
not
that
ive
done
that
lately
maple
and
burnt
sugar
is
lighter
on
the
nose
dominated
by
booze
the
flavor
is
very
light
on
the
malt
and
hops
but
the
hoppy
bitterness
is
present
on
the
finish
vanilla
charred
wood
not
smoke
but
close
and
honey
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
the
overt
syrupy
sweetness
and
one
note
nose
is
keeping
this
beer
from
being
a
solid
a
alcohol
is
in
check
but
you
know
its
there
with
the
heat
and
bitterness
on
the
finish
good
beer
not
great
but
ill
enjoy
my
others
very
enjoyable
sipper
plenty
of
layers
on
the
taste
overall
this
was
a
very
good
barleywine
to
sip
and
enjoy
with
caution
overall
this
is
way
too
drinkable
and
delicious
this
is
how
barrelaging
is
supposed
to
taste
balanced
to
perfection
o
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wines
to
date
nice
and
smooth
saving
a
couple
mmm
the
alcohol
is
here
but
it
isnt
able
to
be
felt
until
quite
a
bit
of
the
bottle
has
been
downed
while
something
like
this
would
be
better
suited
for
a
warm
winters
night
this
is
so
wellcrafted
that
it
can
be
enjoyed
all
year
around
for
anyone
whos
into
this
style
this
is
a
cantmiss
and
worth
the
price
i
wish
more
beers
would
go
out
on
a
limb
and
attempt
this
style
since
its
a
joy
to
behold
a
strong
beer
thats
understated
at
the
same
time
d
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
finest
english
barleywines
readily
available
as
well
affordable
why
has
it
taken
me
this
long
to
try
this
one
the
perfect
winter
warmer
for
those
cold
nights
though
it
was
quite
excellent
on
this
night
as
well
overall
this
is
one
of
the
finer
bourbonbarrel
beers
out
there
it
isnt
too
boozy
its
balanced
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
would
lead
to
passing
out
very
nice
smooth
ale
looks
good
like
a
murky
barrelaged
barley
wine
should
smells
great
malt
cherries
and
wood
notes
are
present
tastes
good
but
its
the
weakest
part
of
the
brew
very
sweet
cherries
and
barrelaging
are
good
but
intense
mothfeel
is
good
goes
down
easily
for
9
5
overall
a
good
brew
but
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
bourbonbarreled
behemoth
if
i
want
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
im
not
choosing
this
but
i
do
like
the
coconut
o
drinks
like
highly
alcoholic
soda
or
bubblegum
even
moreso
than
the
bottles
and
im
not
sure
if
thats
a
good
or
bad
thing
but
for
me
i
like
it
too
boozy
overall
and
probably
too
sweet
for
most
its
different
than
the
abacus
i
just
tried
last
night
but
i
like
them
both
for
very
different
reasons
even
though
they
are
both
barrel
aged
barleywines
very
rich
and
sweet
definitely
a
sipper
overall
a
solid
bal
barleywine
the
bourbon
character
is
limited
but
not
a
total
knock
on
this
brew
overall
a
delicious
brew
that
incorporates
the
flavors
remarkably
well
ive
got
5
more
where
this
came
from
and
i
will
be
enjoying
them
for
months
to
come
an
excellent
oakaged
beer
barrel
aging
accentuates
the
base
beers
flavors
instead
of
overpowering
them
to
get
a
subtle
yet
extremely
flavorful
dram
overall
im
impressed
im
a
fan
of
bourbon
barleywines
and
this
is
among
the
better
of
them
overall
great
oak
aged
english
barleywine
booze
is
completely
hidden
massive
barleywine
flavors
and
nice
complexity
wow
its
fantastic
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
apple
ciderlike
amber
with
a
thin
cap
of
orangetan
head
bubbles
are
nice
and
super
tiny
but
not
much
head
retention
and
minimal
lacing
smells
like
sweet
caramel
malt
toffee
green
apple
oak
bourbon
and
some
dark
fruit
black
currant
taste
is
caramel
oak
bourbon
and
a
little
chocolate
and
vanilla
on
the
finish
i
was
expecting
something
sweeter
from
the
smell
but
this
tastes
pretty
dry
the
oak
and
bourbon
are
well
integrated
the
oak
imparting
some
dry
tannins
carbonation
is
medium
body
is
full
and
theres
a
little
heat
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
barleywine
not
too
heavy
in
spite
of
the
abv
overall
drinkable
delicious
gorgeous
this
is
the
reason
why
i
love
barrelaged
beers
wow
easily
my
favorite
weyerbacher
up
there
with
double
simcoe
many
thanks
to
beenitty
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
ive
had
a
few
of
the
weyerbacher
beers
but
not
this
one
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
dark
redamber
color
about
2
fingers
of
head
a
little
lacing
remains
on
the
glass
smell
prunes
dates
sweet
raisin
spices
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
pretty
complex
taste
some
alcohol
heat
dark
fruits
definitely
the
prunes
raisin
etc
some
real
sweetness
to
the
dark
fruit
that
is
pronounced
on
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
there
is
some
spices
ended
by
a
dark
chocolate
bitterness
alcohol
heat
is
somewhat
noticeable
im
guessing
this
would
mellow
nicely
with
age
as
to
the
style
im
not
really
sure
this
belongs
in
the
english
barleywine
category
maybe
a
american
strong
ale
maybe
an
old
ale
regardless
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
im
planning
to
lay
the
other
3
down
for
a
couple
years
and
see
what
happens
poured
into
my
bruery
tulip
amber
brown
with
a
paper
thin
head
great
lacing
that
quickly
clings
to
the
glass
creamy
caramel
alcohol
upfront
malty
with
hops
in
the
back
taste
is
delicious
caramel
notes
of
rum
and
coconut
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
mouthfeel
of
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body
this
is
a
tasty
beer
medium
full
body
with
soft
carbonation
this
one
is
a
little
sticky
and
a
bit
hot
not
bad
beer
here
also
its
kind
of
cool
to
have
a
pretty
available
barrel
aged
beer
readily
available
if
the
bourbon
could
get
toned
down
a
bit
this
one
would
be
world
class
o
as
i
approach
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
find
myself
enjoying
this
brew
more
than
i
did
at
the
start
maybe
the
flavors
are
blending
and
melting
nicely
on
my
palate
or
maybe
the
alcohol
is
melting
my
inhibitions
and
molding
my
thoughts
and
opinions
for
me
either
way
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
and
want
another
either
now
or
sometime
o
i
was
expecting
some
bourbon
flavors
from
the
barrel
aging
but
was
disappointed
when
they
werent
there
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
much
but
was
expected
since
this
is
an
english
barleywine
overall
good
beer
lots
of
sweet
additions
but
not
too
sweet
great
malt
flavors
light
earthy
hops
boozy
but
not
overly
light
oak
and
nice
whisky
fairly
belgian
strong
ale
or
quad
flavored
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
with
a
very
distinct
red
tinge
around
the
edges
minimal
eggshell
head
that
does
not
linger
too
long
the
aroma
on
this
one
is
great
picking
up
lots
of
dark
fruit
some
toffee
vanilla
cherry
faint
alcohol
notes
a
lot
is
going
on
but
it
all
smells
great
the
taste
is
fantastic
as
well
a
really
complex
beer
a
barleywine
that
is
definitely
a
more
traditional
english
style
with
a
big
malt
background
im
loving
the
mix
of
flavors
carameltoffeedark
fruitalmondvanillacherryslight
bourbon
the
list
goes
on
and
on
low
on
the
carbonation
side
but
drinks
really
smooth
for
11
overall
i
can
see
this
beer
being
a
staple
in
my
house
its
a
great
slow
sipper
to
linger
over
on
a
weekend
evening
weyerbacher
hit
a
home
run
on
this
one
pours
a
clear
ruby
with
brown
tint
one
and
a
half
fingers
of
dense
offwhite
head
settles
to
a
thick
ring
splotchy
sheeting
smell
brown
bread
big
caramelized
sugar
hit
sugary
dates
cherryish
heres
where
the
bourbon
barrel
character
comes
in
taste
raisin
sugary
black
plum
flesh
dates
caramel
note
of
vanilla
and
a
bit
vinous
the
sugary
fruit
goodness
is
cut
by
oak
character
and
twin
small
doses
of
earthy
hops
and
alcohol
but
doesnt
seem
anywhere
near
11
syrupy
feel
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
getting
too
sweet
a
sipper
for
sure
very
nice
2011
o
this
is
absolutely
fucking
brilliant
i
dont
know
why
i
waited
so
long
to
pick
this
up
grabbed
the
last
4pack
from
my
local
worth
every
penny
i
cant
wait
to
put
a
couple
of
years
on
one
and
try
it
again
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
didnt
realize
it
was
a
barleywine
when
i
poured
it
as
it
doesnt
say
so
on
the
bottle
i
think
this
is
my
first
barleywine
experience
and
it
wasnt
too
bad
i
would
try
this
one
again
its
medium
bodied
and
a
heavy
hitter
take
your
time
i
savored
the
last
10
seconds
or
so
of
every
sip
to
really
enjoy
that
amaretto
spiciness
as
i
have
not
experienced
that
before
in
my
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
excellent
bourbon
barrel
aged
english
barelywine
theres
just
too
many
examples
of
american
barleywines
so
its
a
treat
to
get
the
good
old
fashioned
english
version
and
to
have
it
bb
aged
is
just
the
cherry
on
top
of
it
all
o
enjoyed
this
but
i
think
next
time
i
would
be
content
splitting
this
with
someone
even
thought
it
was
a
12oz
it
was
almost
a
little
too
much
to
finish
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
caramel
nuttiness
and
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
the
alcohol
on
this
one
was
very
forward
and
almost
invasive
it
wouldnt
have
been
bad
if
there
was
more
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
slightly
if
you
have
a
bottle
of
this
i
would
suggest
laying
it
down
in
your
cellar
for
awhile
to
allow
this
heat
to
subside
some
so
that
more
subtle
flavors
can
make
their
way
forward
worth
trying
though
fresh
or
aged
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
different
from
some
ive
had
in
that
its
not
extremely
bitter
its
more
sweet
than
bitter
the
flavor
is
very
complex
and
shockingly
smooth
a
rare
case
of
a
barelywine
you
can
sip
now
because
its
not
too
harsh
but
im
sure
itll
only
get
better
with
some
age
a
very
solid
interpretation
of
an
english
barleywine
o
overall
a
very
nice
english
barleywine
i
loved
the
nose
it
was
full
of
bourbon
maple
and
carameltoffee
would
like
to
have
again
what
a
wonderful
experience
i
am
sure
many
will
find
this
style
a
little
over
the
top
sugary
sweetness
reminiscent
of
smarties
candy
transparency
is
difficult
to
ascertain
in
the
light
almost
no
head
with
not
a
lot
of
head
to
it
the
smell
is
caramel
and
a
little
fruity
the
taste
is
nice
sweet
malts
thats
about
my
only
criticism
happy4hoppybeerapr
17
although
a
little
more
slick
than
im
used
to
that
might
be
in
part
due
to
the
fact
that
the
carbonation
is
just
a
little
too
low
insanity
is
a
pretty
good
beer
fresh
out
of
the
gate
but
definitely
a
sipper
brewcrew2010apr

as
the
imbalance
dont
really
make
it
the
most
easy
thing
to
drink
not
bad
anytime
thank
you
fine
carbonation
enough
warmth
for
a
barleywine
great
complexity
this
is
killer
bierguy5apr

but
this
beer
still
remains
low
on
my
list
of
go
to
barleywines
7waysmar

this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
i
would
like
to
drink
it
again
that
said
2011
4
170

544
54not
as
thick
and
cloying
as
most
barleywines
which
i
really
appreciate
there
is
no
syrupy
coating
on
your
lips
and
tongue
the
alcohol
is
evident
but
it
doesnt
drink
like
a
beer
in
excess
of
11
i
would
have
guessed
this
to
be
a
9
ale
one
of
these
will
help
you
sleep
and
that
is
what
i
intend

this

was
slightly
reluctant
to
order
this
because
some
of
the
high
alcohol
weyerbacher
products
tend
to
be
overwhelming
with
the
alcohol
being
the
predominant
flavor
quite
frankly
this
was
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
ever
had
the
vanilla
smooths
over
the
bourban
and
the
fuses
with
the
other
flavors
to
create
barley
wine
bliss
this
is
the
best
weyerbacher
product
i
have
ever
tasted
and
would
recommend
this
product
to
any
beer
pouring
it
into

it

the

which
is
the
version
of
this

two

it
is
possible
to
compare
this

with
recent
memory
of
that
one
the
effects
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
show
in
increased
depth
and
complexity
of
flavor

aroma

with
the
addition
of
a
clear
vanilla
presence


i
enjoyed
this
weyerbacher
offering
but
thought
it
could
have
been
handled
with
a
bit
more
finesse
royaltaug
30
with
a
substantial
but
doesnt
burn
like
it
with
every
sip
oh
for
such
a
large
beer
oak
flavors
are
very
prevelant
with
some
butteriness
as
well
this
pours
a
dark
rich
bronze
w
whipcream
like
head
this
brew
definatly
smells
different
than
i
was
expecting
smells
very
strong
of
nutmeg
almost
like
a
christmas
eggnog
and
some
hints
of
citrus
you
cant
taste
any
of
that
nutmeg
though
the
taste
of
apples
bananas
and
spice
is
strong
alcohol
starts
to
warm
you
up
right
from
the
begining
and
doesnt
release
till
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
a
little
much
for
me
though
i
like
a
barleywine
that
hides
its
strength
comes
across
as
a
little
unbalanced
nice
beer
but
i
wont
be
purchacing
this
one
again
this
isnt
my
favorite
thing
but
its
clearly
well
made
bottle
poured
a
light
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
small
dark
head
with
pretty
good
retention
aroma
of
sweet
liquor
filtered
subtly
through
the
malt
and
sweet
hops
of
this
beer
taste
is
quite
sweet
but
at
least
the
bourbon
aging
and
come
well
together
at
the
end
do
not
overpower
it
probably
one
of
the
best
bourbon
aging
beers
i
had
thanks
to
beerslayer
for
that
one
enjoy
this
one
this
builds
quickly
and
crescendoes
with
a
genuine
shockwave
of
deep
earthy
flavor
and
cozying
warmth
seeming
at
first
almost
complex
the
multitudes
of
components
dance
about
each
other
perhaps
with
heavy
feet
but
never
once
tripping
surprisingly
nimble
for
their
overall
big
presence
this
is
something
to
be
savored
slowly
and
patiently
and
not
just
because
of
that
baldfaced
abv
granted
sharing
the
bottle
is
by
far
the
prudent
move
for
both
your
sobriety
and
your
gullet
but
i
was
in
wonder
as
i
drank
every
drop
allotted
this
beer
is
one
of
the
reason
why
the
oakaged
trend
is
something
to
be
enjoyed
not
every
offering
will
live
up
to
this
one
but
then
that
might
be
too
much
to
ask
because
this
was
simply
that
good
a
well
made
barleywine
which
doesnt
try
to
dominate
any
particular
flavor
and
unique
as
well
with
its
more
fruity
flavor
profile
its
nice
to
have
a
barleywine
which
doesnt
have
to
be
aged
to
be
enjoyed
one
of
my
new
favorites
this
is
blithering
idiot
on
roids
rich
browm
color
and
strong
nose
you
can
pick
up
the
oak
aging
in
the
nose
taste
is
fruity
malty
hoppy
each
coming
and
going
in
an
instant
and
gets
better
as
it
gets
warmer
i
buy
this
to
give
as
a
gift
as
the
label
is
a
hoot
and
i
drink
it
on
special
occasions
fantastic
product
weyerbacher
youve
earned
another
fan
oelergud
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
tasted
the
beer
is
a
bright
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
delicious
with
an
intense
oaky
malt
and
dark
fruit
smell
the
flavors
are
intensely
malty
and
complex
but
very
balanced
and
rounded
with
notes
of
sherry
dark
dried
fruit
and
vanilla
the
finish
has
a
soft
bitterness
along
with
a
warm
alcohol
sensation
the
hops
are
kept
in
balance
while
many
barleywines
have
a
rough
burnt
bitterness
that
lowers
the
drinkability
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
excellent
sipper
that
would
go
great
with
the
gorgonzola
cheese
im
having
right
now
with
it
or
a
nice
after
dinner
macanudo
mouthfeel
is
nice
thick
but
really
drinkable
remember
sip
slowly
but
the
nose
mmmm
its
a
challenge
to
separate
the
enticing
lascivious
aroma
from
the
devilish
results
of
sippage
accept
the
challenge
and
post
your
findings
22
ounce
bomber
pours
out
brownish
red
yellowish
head
big
aroma
of
malt
caramel
oak
vanilla
coconut
whiskey
and
fruit
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
complex
incredible
aromas
ive
experienced
in
a
beer
the
flavor
is
as
big
as
the
aroma
with
many
of
the
same
characteristics
the
tropical
fruit
flavor
is
very
interesting
there
is
a
harsh
alcohol
flavor
too
lots
of
barrel
aging
characteristics
this
is
a
big
improvement
on
the
blithering
idiot
a
bomber
is
a
bit
much
for
one
person
though
had
this
one
in
the
16
6
oz
bottle
courtesy
of
colonial
spirits
it
poured
a
shimmery
brown
to
ruby
red
in
color
with
adequate
offwhite
head
and
slick
lace
the
nose
is
very
strong
reminiscent
of
tobacco
and
brandy
all
the
way
wow
this
brew
is
like
having
a
meal
the
mouthfeel
is
robust
heavy
and
certainly
chewy
is
this
dinner
yep
the
taste
buds
tingle
with
a
prominent
smooth
smokey
maltiness
thats
accompanied
by
a
tobacco
edge
as
well
as
some
clove
beating
around
the
bush
the
finish
is
more
brandylike
with
clear
punctuations
of
the
high
alcohol
content
this
fine
brew
offers
ultimately
i
sense
some
lingering
licorice
flavors
on
the
back
of
the
palate
special
of
course
at
11
alcohol
and
with
such
a
rich
and
complex
taste
this
isnt
a
session
beer
but
it
makes
for
an
enjoyable
nightcap
this
is
the
second
release
out
of
three
in
the
oakaged
line
of
beers
from
weyerbacher
the
bottle
opens
with
a
decent
release
of
gas
and
with
the
yeast
poured
its
a
hazy
dark
chestnut
with
orange
highlights
beneath
a
thin
head
of
creamy
light
tan
foam
that
receeds
quickly
to
just
an
average
collar
of
course
the
11
alcohol
will
help
to
do
that
the
nose
delivers
a
waft
of
bourbon
sweetish
vanilla
drying
woody
oak
dried
dark
fruits
and
a
distinctly
caramelish
malt
as
well
as
an
occassional
note
of
cocoanut
its
full
supple
maltiness
slides
more
oily
than
creamy
across
the
tongue
and
its
veryfine
bubbled
seemingly
natural
carbonation
lends
a
gentle
caress
to
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
rich
and
complex
with
a
pleasant
note
of
alcohol
vanilla
dark
fruit
skins
almonds
carameltoffee
almostburnt
brown
sugar
a
lick
of
black
licorice
wood
a
lowkey
leafy
hoppiness
and
a
rounding
note
of
delicate
buttery
diacetyl
wow
its
not
as
malty
or
hoppy
as
most
american
versions
but
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
based
on
british
barleywines
many
of
which
are
more
along
these
lines
on
the
other
hand
however
its
at
american
barleywine
strength
it
finishes
drying
as
its
alcohol
and
drying
woodiness
battle
what
residual
maltiness
is
there
and
more
licorice
flavor
comes
out
as
it
warms
quite
impressive
thank
you
weyerbacher
if
this
somehow
doesnt
become
a
staple
im
going
to
be
very
sad
i
may
spend
the
rest
of
the
money
in
my
bank
account
now
on
getting
bottles
just
to
have
them
i
believe
this
is
the
staple
all
barley
wines
should
be
trying
to
match
not
only
that
but
from
most
of
the
barley
wines
ive
tried
the
greenness
factor
is
a
huge
variable
but
with
this
young
guy
it
doesnt
even
matter
and
its
perfect
now
that
to
me
means
that
if
this
gets
better
as
it
gets
older
im
in
for
a
very
tangible
and
effulgent
form
of
pure
perfection

exotic

this
is
an

in
styles
that
has
gone
wonderfully
well
a
must
try
for
barley
wine
fans
cheers
great
mouthfeel
with
a
warming
and
satisfying
finish
very
drinkable
but
at

abv
its
not
a
beer
to
be
quaffed
quickly
take
your
time
with
it
get
to
know
it
a

and
the
friendship
will
blossom

the
taste
is
everything
found
on
the
nose
with
the
oak
becoming
much
more
assertive
unlike
the
heresy
where
the
bourbon
dominates
the
bourbon
takes
a
back
seat
here
with
oak
vanilla
and
fruit
really
coming
through
the
alchohol
is
immediately
noticeable
after
you
swallow
as
your
throat
warms
this
is
a
very
lightly
carbonated
and
smooth
beer
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
sipping
beer
and
doesnt
kick
you
on
your
ass
as
much
as
some
other
barleywines
this
beer
pours
a
deep
garnet
with
a
tall
head
that
dissapears
quickly
there
are
rich
malty
aromas
of
vanilla
nutmeg
cinnimon
and
powerful
bourbon
oak
like
it
was
oak
aged
in
jiom
beam
barrels
or
something
the
beer
tastes
oaky
and
really
like
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
the
alcohol
is
not
really
evident
until
you
swallow
then
a
mild
warming
sensation
creeps
up
from
your
gullet
this
is
a
smooth
beer
and
at
11
abv
it
is
smooth
and
agreeable
not
as
up
front
and
in
your
faceliek
some
other
barleywines
a
nice
sipping
beer
that
is
not
overwhelming
drinkability
this
one
could
become
addictive
even
though
theres
an
alcohol
presence
its
fitting
in
the
context
of
this
beer
and
the
oak
aging
does
wonders
for
the
taste
and
smoothness
of
this
barleywine
a
great
beer
best
one
ive
had
from
weyerbacher
drinkability
a
little
harsh
on
the
alcohol
at
this
point
some
aging
would
do
this
wonders
not
my
favorite
barley
wine
but
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
interesting
barrelaged
one
yummmm
a
very
complex
and
tasty
creation
i
like
it
like
it
like
it
smell
was
of
vanilla
oak
and
caramel
sugars
with
very
slight
spiciness
from
some
hop
perhaps
taste
hits
with
a
malty
sweetness
up
front
vanilla
and
sugars
and
finishes
slighly
crisp
with
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
the
alcohol
is
present
in
the
aroma
as
well
but
no
where
near
overpowering
all
in
all
a
very
nice
barley
wine
wow
i
like
this
beer
bought
it
cause
the
name
sounded
interesting
i
didint
realize
the
kick
it
would
have
definitely
a
high
octane
beer
you
can
smell
and
taste
the
alcohol
and
i
like
that
in
a
beer
looks
like
a
nice
dubbel
in
the
glass
the
smell
may
be
a
little
sour
but
the
taste
is
real
nice
i
wish
i
could
remember
how
much
i
paid
for
the
bottle
i
will
be
picking
up
another
bottle
on
my
next
trip
to
the
store
most
would
agree
that
this
very
complex
concoction
is
a
crowd
pleaser
nice
head
in
pour
lasts
throughout
creamy
mouthfeel
unique
yeast
woodyness
did
something
i
guess
mellowed
the
barleywine
flavour
aroma
of
rum
and
alcohol
malty
vanilla
and
also
chocolate
malt
a
bit
better
in
a
bottle
had
all
to
myself
later
on
oh
one
quick
note
i
recieved
this
bottle
in
trade
and
i
cannot
remember
who
from
i
would
like
to
give
credit
but
since
i
cant
remember
thank
you
whoever
you
were
a
great
beer
for
very
special
occasions
i
think
i
might
age
some
myself
next
to
some
blithering
idiot
and
see
what
happens
two
signs
should
appear
on
the
label

caution
let
it
warm

drink
slow
bourbon
crossing
drinkability
im
gonna
have
to
get
a
few
more
of
these

the

not

of

this

shelf
i
was
excited
being
a

fan
of

barely
wine
this
is
a
beer
that
is
dark
in
colour
with
an
aroma
that
hints
at
the
tastes
to
come
a
very
complex
beer
with
the
smell
of
the
oak
barrels
and
malts
that
were
used
the
taste
starts
off
malty
then
there
are
hints
of
vanilla
and
oak
with

gives

as
to
what

this
is

to

slowly
downy
pillow
of
thick
starting
head
that
begins
to
lace
immediately
and
eventually
withers
to
a

pours
a
nutty
brown
color
with
reddish
tints
it
produces
a
1
12
finger
thick
head
which
goes
down
slowly
some
lacing
was
noticed
as
i
polished
off
this
beer
the
smell
was
nutty
with
hints
of
wood
fruit
and
hazelnut
tasting
this
beer
is
an
experience
with
flavors
of
fruit
which
yields
to
a
woody
hazelnut
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
like
coffee
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
the
alcohol
hits
you
pretty
hard
after
a
bit
overall
one
id
definitely
buy
again
this
stuff
was
damn
incredible
i
loved
it
a
bit
pricey
to
be
a
regular
beer
but
for
special
occasions
its
perfect

colonial
spirits
acton
ma
mouthfeel
is
full
and
thick
slightly
syrupy
this
brew
coats
the
palate
and
makes
its
presence
known
perfect
for
the
style
just
the
way
i
like
it
this
is
definelty
a
sipping
brew
take
some
time
out
sit
and
savor
this
brew
for
maximum
enjoyment
cheers
to
weyerbacher
for
brewing
this
beauty
and
cheers
to
blitheringidiot
for
allowing
me
the
opportunity
to
sample
it
id
also
like
to
comment
on
the
art
work
of
the
label
weyerbacher
has
a
pretty
bland
label
traditionally
but
the
more
recent
releases
are
a
major
improvement
this
label
is
a
nice
followup
to
the
heresy
label
sidenote
youre
best
off
to
sip
insanity
slowly
and
really
savor
the
flavors
as
they
develop
i
promise
you
you
wont
be
let
down
dont
drink
this
cold
and
fast
youll
really
be
missing
out
on
all
of
the
greatness
that
comes
forth
as
it
warms
drinkability
and
overall
brilliant
im
so
proud
of
weyerbacher
for
making
such
a
fabulous
brew
the
richest
and
creamiest
barleywine
around
the
balance
achieved
is
so
perfect
it
makes
one
fumble
in
and
out
of
insanity
as
they
drink
this
beer
the
reason
its
called
insanity
is
obvious
to
me
this
beer
is
so
wonderful
it
damn
near
drives
you
insane
i
really
enjoyed
the
vanilla
flavor
in
this
beer
its
a
bit
unusual
and
balanced
the
oaky
notes
ive
got
to
get
another
bottle
soon
and
add
it
to
my
cellar
to
see
how
it
ages
i
think
it
will
smooth
out
nicely
and
ease
some
of
the
alcohol
notes
seems
that
the
bourbon
cask
made
its
job
and
created
a
yet
more
intriguing
brew
maybe
this
should
be
layed
down
a
few
years
to
create
perfection
dont
know
but
certainly
a
nice
meeting
12

about
55
pours
a
murky

color
with
a

khaki
colored
head
some
overripened
apple
and
woody
esters
with
a
sporadic
alcohol
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
bean
aroma
underneath
a
solid
malt
backbone
bourbon
is
less
present
in
the
aroma
as
opposed
to
the
heresy
surprisingly
mellow
i
thought
the
bourbonbarrel
aging
might
be
a
little
too
forceful
malty
and
creamy
rich
some
tropical
esters
come
through
as
well
as
a
drier
woody
finish
from
the
barrelaging
some
vanilla
bean
extract
and
maraschino
cherry
taste
makes
its
way
through
a
good
beer
that
would
cellar
nicely
a
nice
modification
that
revs
up
an
average
englishstyle
barleywine
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
outstanding
it
has
a
very
complex
malt
palate
that
is
overlayed
with
a
very
fine
bourbon
scent
it
boasts
of
multiple
caramel
and
pale
malts
along
with
a
slight
vanilla
odor
the
taste
is
awesome
it
has
a
very
rich
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
caramel
and
some
chocolate
malts
it
show
off
its
elevated
abv
but
is
mellowed
with
the
oak
barrel
aging
it
adds
a
smooth
bourbon
flavor
to
the
already
complex
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
i
love
the
barrel
aging
i
hope
to
see
more
beers
of
the
same
style
it
drinks
well
and
warms
stomach
this
beer
is
great
and
ill
put
my
other
bottle
in
the
cellar
to
see
how
much
mellower
this
puppy
can
get
maybe
the
slickest
brew
around
today
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
not
as
much
of
an
aroma
as
i
expected
definite
creamy
head
glowing
cloudy
bloodorange
color
hits
you
right
away
with
a
vanilla
bourbon
creaminess
strong
malt
flavor
but
not
heavy
kind
of
a
sticky
mouthfeel
i
felt
like
i
was
getting
a
milk
moustache
drinking
this
stuff
but
not
overly
sweet
at
all
i
think
caskaging
this
takes
some
of
the
heady
sweetness
out
of
this
barleywines
regular
punch
and
helped
balance
it
more
light
whiskey
aftertaste
mixed
with
a
stronger
oak
aftertaste
goes
down
really
smooth
unusually
smooth
dangerously
smooth
ill
be
buying
this
again
oh
yes
insanity
poured
out
a
just
slightly
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
thin
wispy
white
foam
topping

give
you
a
quick
zap
of
bourbon
barrel
before
immersing
you
in
sweet
malt
vanilla
vague
fruitiness
and
a
hint
of
alcoholic
zest
taste
proves
to
be
surprisingly
well
rounded
bourbon
barrel
and
oak
come
out
at
first
but
only
to
serve
as
an
introduction
and
accent
rather
than
the
brutality
of
bourbon
in
some
other
barrel
aged
brews
very
candi
sweet
and
caramely
through
the
middle
with
a
hint
of
peppery
spice
finish
gives
you
a
slight
bitterness
light
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
anise
even
body
is
full
but
not
too
thick
quite
drinkable
for
a
big
barleywine
and
worthy
of
distinction
from
its
blithering
cousin
i
find
it
a
little
ironic
that
i
didnt
care
for
heresy
at
all
and
yet
find
myself
purchasing
this
beer
fairly
frequently
i
think
its
all
about
balance
which
i
didnt
feel
heresy
had
but
insanity
most
certainly
does
an
excellent
brew
for
those
looking
for
something
a
little
different
and
easily
weyerbachers
best
product
this
beer
pours
with
a
nice
deep
dark
reddish
tint
and
a
head
that
quickly
goes
away
it
has
a
very
nice
vanilla
aroma
the
taste
is
different
than
any
other
barley
wine
ive
erver
had
very
malty
with
a
bourbon
vanilla
taste
and
an
alcohol
finish
very
smooth
it
is
an
exceptional
beer
to
sit
in
front
of
a
fire
or
to
watch
a
good
football
game
it
tastes
so
good
it
could
deffinately
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
go
for
more
like
brother
heresy
weyerbacher
takes
a
good
beer
blithering
idiot
and
makes
it
better
as
i
watch
the
foot
of
snow
outside
all
still
seems
right
give
this
a
try
though
beware
of
price
gouging
dare
i
say
insanely
good
pours
a
very
deep
clear
brown
with
about
one
finger
of
head
that
disappears
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
lace
first
smell
that
hits
you
is
that
of
bourbon
but
it
gradually
gives
way
to
an
underlying
maltiness
doubled
with
an
offsetting
spicy
nose
very
unique
aroma
that
gets
you
excited
for
your
first
sip
flavor
itself
is
very
interesting
its
bourbonheavy
with
a
good
sweetspicy
balance
before
finishing
extremely
malty
and
vanilla
with
a
wonderful
malt
aftertaste
the
alcohol
is
extremely
wellhidden
for
its
potency
and
the
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
makes
it
much
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
others
in
its
weight
class
i
cant
imagine
wanting
more
than
one
at
once
but
i
can
see
really
enjoying
this
one
on
a
snowy
night
if
this
is
insanitycommit
me
for
life
clear
medium
brown
no
head
light
rummy
and
bourbony
aroma
presenting
vanilla
and
sadly
no
fruits
at
all
resulting
in
a
simple
sweet
slightly
woody
and
earthy
array
of
flavors
at
which
the
integration
is
not
all
that
while
i
can
name
a
few
flavors
its
not
too
complex
and
very
candyish
straight
bourbon
flavor
also
makes
for
a
disappointing
palate
compared
to
the
aroma
astringent
finish
almost
roasty
finish
feels
a
bit
harsh
alcohol
is
strong
still
creamy
medium
body
is
very
liqurous
but
this
fits
here
it
feels
like
a
run
as
fast
as
possible
to
follow
a
trend
to
me
do
they
also
run
to
catch
the
new
seasons
fashion
clothe
color
or
perhaps
it
was
just
released
a
little
too
early
still
as
it
is
boring

at
from
the
vine
beer
tasting

2005
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
very
thin
light
tan
head
lacing
is
nonexistent
woody
aroma
with
a
strong
bourbonwhiskey
presence
rich
body
and
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
in
this
one
at
all
oak
and
toffee
flavors
are
masked
by
the
bourbon
flavor
at
first
and
the
sting
doesnt
go
away
for
awhile
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
pretty
good
beer
but
kind
of
hard
to
drink
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
barleywine
dark
brown
color
with
some
ruby
high
lights
it
poured
very
clear
with
a
medium
cream
colored
head
that
did
leave
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
hop
fruit
grapefruit
primarilywith
some
vanilla
from
the
oak
aging
i
must
say
this
beer
does
well
conditioned
with
the
oak
the
taste
has
more
vanilla
even
pecans
up
front
the
hops
show
midway
through
the
flavor
with
some
hop
flower
and
mild
pine
flavors
malt
shows
late
in
the
drink
with
a
mild
caramel
sweetness
the
oak
aging
lends
a
great
silky
mouth
feel
to
the
beer
very
drinkable
weyerbecher
needs
to
continue
this
oak
aged
series
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
beer
again
at
the
extreme
fest
this
beer
looks
like
an
antique
cabinet
dark
reddish
tints
show
through
against
the
dark
brown
color
the
colors
blend
together
like
wood
grain
a
thin
creamy
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
probably
one
of
the
strongest
smelling
beers
ive
come
across
the
closer
you
get
your
nose
to
the
beer
the
more
it
smells
like
a
straight
up
glass
of
whisky
straight
from
the
rivers
of
kentucky
other
sweeter
scents
are
detectable
too
such
as
dark
cherries
vanilla
and
sweet
ripe
mellow
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
bitterness
hiding
somewhere
in
there
an
amazingly
aromatic
brew
the
taste
is
just
as
good
sweet
overlyripe
fruits
pears
berries
nectarines
whatever
hit
the
palate
first
followed
by
a
cherry
vanilla
sweetness
all
the
while
you
can
definately
feel
a
combination
of
a
hop
kick
and
an
alcohol
burn
on
the
tongue
the
11
alcohol
is
noticable
in
the
way
that
it
warms
the
throat
and
stomach
but
not
overly
present
in
the
taste
this
is
an
intrigueingly
real
word
complex
beer
i
like
it
very
smooth
and
syrupy
juicy
mouthfeel
as
is
typical
of
the
barley
wine
style
drinkabilty
is
really
surprisingly
good
considering
the
style
and
abv
of
this
beer
a
real
winner
by
weyerbacher
this
beer
both
exemplifies
its
style
and
also
challenges
it
and
defines
it
differently
and
originally
which
i
think
is
one
of
the
highest
achievements
of
brewing
ill
drink
to
that
for
sure
thick
creamy
dark
tan

holds
strong
deep
hazy

with
a
ruby
hue
fairly
strong
aroma
a
bit
of
whiskey
up
front
with
some
woody
vanilla
that
almost
comes
together
smelling
like
coconut
theres
whiskey
all
over
the
flavor
as
well
but
theres
also
some
nice
dark
malty
fruit
and
some
more
caramelvanilla
finish
is
slightly
alcoholic
and
ultimately
pretty
clean
warms
the
stomach
up
real
nice
body
is
on
the
thick
side
as
expected
and
helps
to
coat
your
tongue
in
flavor
whiskey
tones
are
strong
but
not
as
detracting
as
in
the
heresy
while
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
plenty
going
on
to
keep
me
interested
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
creamy
head
and
great
lacing
smell
is
oak
malt
bourbon
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
whoa
you
get
the
feeling
this
is
going
to
pack
a
wallop
taste
starts
with
a
malt
presence
and
a
distinct
alcohol
pop
a
smooth
maltiness
hits
on
the
midpalate
with
the
hint
of
vanilla
ends
in
alcohol
and
hop
kickpretty
smooth
for
the
abv
why
does
this
remind
me
of
fine
whiskey
must
be
the
oak
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
for
the
abv
very
surprising
easy
enough
to
drink
but
honestly
i
could
feel
the
power
early
on
just
one
a
night
is
fine
enjoy
keep
those
oak
casks
going
weyerbacher
a
good
complement
to
heresy
which
i
understand
will
be
brewed
year
round
poured

dense
clowdy

red
with
a
small
thin
head
a
rich

licorice
black
cherry
and
dark
chocolate
a
dense
malty
richness
with
a
hint
of
port
wine
stuck
at
the
sides
makes
this
a
real
treat
for
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
heavy
as
one
might
expect
which
makes
the
hard
to
find

that
much
more
dangerous
definitely
a
great
winter
beer
and
one
that
i
hope
to
have
more
of
in
the
future
insanity
poured
a
deep
blood

into
my
snifter
with
about
an
inch
of
frothy

that
settled
into

pretty
decent

tasteagain
bourbon
up

it
has
a
suprisingly
sweet

i
served
this
a
little
too
cold
so
after
fifteen
minutes
of
anxious
anticipation
i
dove
back
in
wow
mouthfeel
is
very
full
with
an
amazing
amount
of
warmth
creamy
malt
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
that
first
cadbury
egg
of
the
season
this
bitch
is
dangerous
i
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
insane
this
beer
pours
and
amberred
color
with
very
little
head
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
fruit
tones
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
oak
the
flavor
has
some
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
with
vanilla
and
some
hints
of
wood
the
drinkability
is
ok
slightly
suffering
from
the
alcohol
the
body
is
good
right
where
it
should
be
recommendation
allow
to
warm
to
room
temperature
and
enjoy
in
a
widebowled
snifter
this
will
allow
all
of
the
malt
and
wood
complexities
to
really
pull
through
as
well
as
enhance
the
alcohol
presence
taste
is
complex
to
the
nth
degree
justifying
the
insanity
name
no
hop
monster
this
one
very
unique
flavor
profile
compared
to
other
barleywines
ive
sampled
this
one
is
smooth
and
creamy
satiny
in
fact
without
any
rough
edges
vanilla
and
oak
tones
are
prominent
with
a
kiss
of
premium
kentucky
bourbon
warmth
cherries
raisins
and
toasted
caramel
apple
notes
add
to
the
intrigue
alcohol
harshness
is
totally
missing
other
than
the
bourbon
warmth
damn
this
one
leaves
me
at
a
loss
of
descriptive
words
it
is
so
complex
that
insanity
is
all
i
can
come
up
with
incredible
sums
up
the
experience
of
sipping
this
one
for
over
an
hour
very
drinkable
but
in
a
very
slow
manner
take
your
time
with
this
one
it
is
foolish
nay
insane
to
try
more
than
one
of
these
a
month
weyerbacher
has
produced
a
classic
with
this
one
a
dark
burnt
sienna
color
with
hues
of
ruby
a
darker
color
then
the
texas
longhorns
uniform
shade
of
orange
not
the
best
description
i
know
but
that
is
the
ebst
way
to
describe
the
color
off
whitetanish
head
that
sticks
around
makeing
me
grow
impatient
cause
i
want
to
get
a
sip
but
the
head
is
so
large
i
know
it
will
be
one
of
those
circumstances
when
you
get
a
nose
full
of
foam
so
you
must
wait
smells
of
over
ripened
fruit
malty
sweetness
and
a
slight
burn
of
alcohol
when
the
sip
first
hits
your
tounge
it
is
dark
cherries
but
as
you
swallow
it
fades
to
a
sweeter
currant
flavor
plum
and
malty
sweetness
also
exist
along
with
the
pungent
taste
of
alcohol
when
it
is
cold
the
hops
hit
you
kind
of
ahrsh
as
you
would
expect
from
an
american
style
barley
wine
but
as
it
warms
this
fdes
to
a
nice
smoothness
the
only
tihng
ditracting
from
the
smoothness
is
the
obvious
alcohol
taste
some
sips
this
alcohol
taste
is
a
deterent
but
on
most
it
compliments
the
style
and
the
beer
somewhat
heavy
and
light
on
carbonation
swirling
it
in
the
glass
doesnt
even
seem
to
stir
a
thin
coat
of
foam
very
good
much
smoother
then
some
other
american
versions
of
this
style
i
wonder
how
aging
will
treat
this
beer
already
smooth
and
not
overly
hoppy
i
would
hope
more
vanillia
flavors
might
perk
from
the
barrel
aging
as
well
as
the
fruit
notes
coming
out
more
whole
heartedly
this
22
oz
bomber
was
shipped
as
part
of
the
bif
xmas
package
by
shippos
i
saved
it
for
the
grand
finale
of
the
experience
when
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
goblet
it
had
a
deep
red
color
and
a
clear
body
a
fizzy
one
inch
thick
head
formed
while
pouring
but
soon
dissipated
to
a
quarter
of
its
original
size
the
aroma
was
relatively
mild
and
reminded
me
of
toffee
pears
powdered
cocoa
and
vanilla
the
taste
was
divinely
mellow
with
oak
aged
vinous
dry
notes
shining
through
each
sip
the
malt
presented
itself
as
raisin
cherry
raspberry
and
subtle
hints
of
dark
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
thick
and
a
bit
prickly
the
alcohol
was
very
boozy
and
hot
detracting
from
being
able
to
down
this
one
quickly
for
those
of
you
that
can
get
this
id
recommend
some
ageing
in
the
bottle
for
additional
improvements
review
20
on
this
beer
this
one
pours
a
very
nice
ruby
color
with
a
small
half
finger
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
very
sweet
some
nice
sweet
cherry
with
a
very
oaky
vanilla
touch
that
balances
things
out
a
lot
the
flavor
is
really
nice
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
but
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
flavors
but
not
as
much
as
the
heresy
the
feel
is
very
thick
and
full
drinkability
is
nice
on
this
as
well
i
think
the
oak
flavors
work
very
well
with
the
base
barleywine
good
show
good
show
thanks
to
my
son
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
this
latest
edition
of
their
specialty
line
poured
a
very
dark
clear
copper
amber
color
and
formed
a
foamy
off
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
heavy
of
elements
of
malt
caramel
and
red
wine
the
flavor
consisted
of
malt
caramel
wood
and
red
wine
the
body
was
medium
with
the
finish
being
slightly
astrigent
with
vinous
characteristics
the
overall
combination
of
characteristics
of
this
beer
really
made
it
stand
out
drinkabilty
of
barley
winesold
ales
like
this
is
always
tough
to
measure
one
of
my
favorites
in
2004
i
have
always
enjoyed
weyerbachers
big
beer
sampler
case
they
have
elevated
the
blithering
idiot
barleywine
to
new
heights
by
cask
aging
it
in
bourbon
barrels
the
appearance
is
dark
amber
with
garnet
hightlights
head
is
opaque
and
shows
nice
traces
of
lace
as
the
beer
is
enjoyed
the
nose
exhibits
traces
of
vanilla
with
strong
hints
of
bourbon
the
flavor
develops
as
the
ale
warms
starts
out
with
luscious
vanilla
and
woody
notes
with
stronger
hints
of
bourbon
the
longer
you
enjoy
it
this
is
a
serious
beer
that
is
seriously
delicious
i
highly
recommend
it
poured
a
great
dark
reddish
amber
with
an
off
white
head
that
fell
to
a
film
after
a
few
minutes
and
left
some
lacing
but
not
much
the
smell
was
of
oak
burbon
and
a
beautiful
fruity
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
masked
nicely
the
taste
started
off
fruity
and
caramel
sweetness
then
moved
into
a
vanilla
and
whiskey
flavor
and
finished
with
a
smooth
touch
of
alcohol
and
oak
acutally
there
was
a
touch
of
oak
across
the
entire
taste
experience
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
as
slik
perfectly
carbonated
and
had
excellent
body
wow
this
is
one
bad
ass
beer
i
will
be
looking
for
this
again
really
soon
this
review
was
from
a
22oz
bottle
this
poured
out
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
about
an
inch
of
tan
foam
on
top
the
head
sticks
around
for
an
unusually
long
time
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
is
of
ripe
dark
fruits
with
a
malty
sweetness
notes
of
vanilla
woodiness
and
alcohol
are
also
in
the
mix
quite
a
full
and
complex
aroma
that
might
take
me
a
few
bottles
to
figure
out
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
fruits
and
a
touch
of
caramel
there
are
some
notes
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
characteristics
as
well
quite
a
mix
of
flavors
going
on
here
and
every
thing
seems
to
balance
each
other
out
quite
nicely
there
is
also
some
toasty
malt
in
there
as
well
and
it
ends
with
a
light
alcohol
burn
simply
awesome
mouthfeel
is
full
thick
and
creamy
with
a
slight
warmth
to
it
excellent
drinkability
here
i
could
drink
this
all
night
or
as
long
as
i
could
stay
awake
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
offering
and
plan
to
pick
more
of
this
up
to
keep
around
for
the
cold
months
ahead
cheers
mouthfeel
drinkability
decent
the
strong
oak
character
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
unihibited
but
the
allure
of
the
flavor
itself
makes
it
difficult
to
resist
im
a
huge
fan
of
whatever
they
did
to
transform
a
simple
blithering
idiot
into
this
demented
robot
genius
from
hell
its
that
good
weyerbacher
defines
insanity
as
extremely
foolishness
an
extreme
oak
aged
blithering
idiot
who
is
also
foolish
but
they
dont
achieve
their
goal
because
anyone
buying
this
product
is
rewarded
honestly
its
worth
the
life
of
a
blithering
idiot
this
one
was
poured
from
22
ounce
bottle
with
a
laughingly
insane
idiot
silhouetted
in
red
the
color
is
a
deep
dark
ruby
with
a
respectable
offwhite
head
especially
considering
the
abv
its
aroma
is
complex
and
satisfying
thick
malt
wood
alcohol
caramel
raisins
and
spice
the
smell
isnt
quite
as
intense
as
some
barleywines
but
its
certainly
multidimensional
the
taste
is
simply
extraordinary
fullness
of
flavor
is
an
understatementyoure
almost
consumed
by
the
taste
malt
alcohol
whiskey
and
wood
touch
of
yeast
dab
of
hops
overripe
fruit
molasses
and
on
and
on
superb
flavor
with
an
alcohol
bite
thick
full
heavy
body
unbelievably
drinkablecreamy
warming
i
need
another
one
of
these
the
mouthfeel
starts
smooth
and
ends
with
a
light
crisp
finish
the
alcohol
and
oak
laden
malt
rides
the
tongue
well
after
the
finish
one
bottle
was
just
enough
to
enjoy
over
a
long
period
so
drinkability
score
is
just
below
good
beer
is
good
happy
wood
barrel
aged
barley
aged
beering
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
as
much
as
i
love
heresy
this
makes
it
look
like
a
flying
fish
beer
magnificent
stuff
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
else
is
up
the
sleeve
of
this
seemingly
revitalized
brewery
the
newest
brew
from
weyerbacher
is
probably
the
best
brew
that
they
have
ever
made
this
is
a
dark
ruddy
rust
coloured
brew
with
a
nice
head
of
beigekhaki
the
aromas
are
all
jim
beam
like
notes
of
oak
vanilla
caramel
bourbon
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
strong
with
the
same
bourbon
notes
in
the
mix
vanilla
caramel
alcohol
and
green
green
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
pretty
thick
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
was
very
very
good
for
an
11
1abv
brew
nice
one
weyerbacher
nice
one
thanks
to
gentlemen
mike
sir
yen157
who
plopped
this
one
in
my
hand
whilst
i
was
in
mugs
last
friday
during
a
long
weekend
trip
to
the
big
apple
with
two
friends
from
england
a
total
surprise
and
highly
appreciated
as
indeed
was
the
beer
itself
thanks
to
mike
and
davida
cheers
to
you
both
for
this
one
i
owe
ya
for
this
better
go
and
raid
my
stash
amber
and
dark
cider
colored
unclear
and
beautiful
khaki
ring
of
head
on
the
sides
amazingly
wonderful
scents
of
whiskey
rum
vanilla
and
caramel
yummm
the
first
sip
hits
you
on
the
sides
of
your
tongue
creamy
and
medium
or
maybe
a
bit
more
heavy
but
perfect
tastes
of
warm
alcohol
whisky
maltiness
dark
and
lovely
and
smooth
so
freakin
lovely
the
oaky
woodsyness
comes
through
so
nicely
they
did
such
a
beautiful
job
with
this
great
drinkability
as
a
sipper
not
as
one
you
want
to
throw
back
huge
quantities
of
but
man
i
could
sit
back
with
a
few
bottles
of
these
for
a
damn
fine
evening
love
this
stuff
sorry
for
the
low
drinkability
rating
but
its
just
too
rich
and
strong
to
be
called
a
drinkable
beer
nevertheless
another
incredible
beer
by
weyerbacher
very
oily
appearance
and
mouthfeel
with
a
pearl
white
head
though
quick
to
disappear
this
is
the
blithering
idiot
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
a
fantastic
follow
up
to
the
heresy
rich
vanilla
oaky
flavors
slighty
woody
back
up
a
strong
alcohol
warming
barleywine
slighty
fruity
on
the
nose
sort
of
a
delicate
ripe
smell
nice
malt
flavors
in
the
beginning
immediatly
followed
by
slight
hops
british
maybe
a
high
alpha
and
then
a
nice
kentucky
bourbon
finish
the
perfect
nightcap
id
love
to
sip
this
beer
in
the
snow
by
a
campfire
i
think
it
comes
out
nov
1st
2004
ruddybrown
pour
with
a
half
inch
or
so
of
frothy
offwhite
head
that
sank
to
a
thin
layer
minimal
lacing
toasty
aroma
bready
earthy
caramel
malts
toasted
grains
and
malts
in
the
taste
brown
sugar
earthy
light
notes
of
raisin
and
herbal
hops
with
a
bitter
bite
its
not
as
smooth
as
i
like
my
barleywines
but
its
drinkable
with
a
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
decent
but
not
amazing
really
solid
overall
except
that
there
was
a
lot
of
yeast
at
the
bottom
so
decant
carefully
our
last
pour
looked
like
bud
mud
the
palate
is
nice
toast
floral
notes
caramel
burnt
sugar
toffee
and
butterscotch
are
all
present
in
nice
balance
nice
malt
palate
here
the
midpalate
otoh
is
a
little
thin
drying
on
the
finish
with
toffee
this
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
and
has
a
mediumlow
level
of
carbonation
nice
stuff
i
really
enjoyed
my
pour
copper
hued
with
an
eighth
inch
of
tan
head
slight
haze
aromas
of
toffee
a
touch
of
butterscotch
malt
smells
aged
a
bit
of
dampness
rain
water
cool
taste
follows
suit
mellow
and
easy
drinking
smooth
on
the
palate
thin
to
medium
bodied
nice
beer
cool
to
have
one
five
years
old
thanks
dyan
medium
body
and
carbonation
smooth
enough
kind
of
an
unremarkable
mouthfeel
felt
like
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
heft
and
stickiness
o
this
is
a
nice
sipping
beer
because
it
has
some
complexities
in
the
flavors
but
the
alcohol
isnt
very
prominent
in
the
taste
o
the
flavors
arent
offensive
but
theyre
kinda
unrefined
nothing
here
stands
out
as
foul
but
the
beer
is
so
challenging
to
drink
its
missing
a
few
things
nothing
really
sets
this
apart
its
a
ok
barleywine
but
there
are
a
lot
better
ones
out
there
when
considering
the
price
point
i
say
just
stay
away
from
it
o
a
good
barleywine
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
bit
more
and
let
it
sit
for
a
little
over
a
year
till
this
review
im
bumping
the
appearance
soley
because
of
the
awesome
awesome
bottle
label
if
you
love
the
rudolph
christmas
classic
youll
appreciate
it
glad
i
could
pick
this
up
at
the
brewery
a
year
ago
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
the
body
was
a
reddish
brown
color
body
with
not
head
but
a
thin
lace
around
the
top
the
smell
was
sweet
and
fruity
had
a
bubble
gum
hint
to
it
the
taste
was
sweet
but
had
some
hop
bitterness
to
it
very
well
balanced
of
the
sweet
and
the
bitterness
the
mouth
feel
was
nice
and
crisp
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
pretty
good
gateway
beer
for
barleywines
as
most
english
styles
should
be
but
they
need
to
work
on
the
bottle
conditioning
if
theyre
going
to
charge
north
of
20bottle
violation
a
really
tasty
beer
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
i
acquired
this
bottle
over
the
summer
and
i
cant
imagine
its
too
old
in
any
event
it
is
drinking
wonderfully
now
o
this
is
okay
too
sweet
for
me
booze
not
particularly
well
hidden
not
bad
but
if
im
drinking
other
things
id
pass
on
this
one
beer
is
medium
in
body
sweet
on
the
front
nice
finish
on
the
back
the
beer
is
slightly
raisiny
flavored
i
enjoyed
it
but
theres
nothing
special
about
it
o
overall
a
good
barleywine
this
one
seems
to
be
a
big
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
most
but
the
dark
fruits
are
nice
super
easy
to
drink
and
nic
emouthfeel
something
i
would
have
again
would
really
like
to
try
the
ba
version
again
pours
a
moderatelyclear
copperred
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
thin
cap
and
a
nice
collar
throughout
nose
brings
some
light
malt
plus
a
bit
of
cherry
and
fruit
light
booze
flavor
is
slightly
malty
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
light
grainy
dryness
moderate
body
with
low
carbonation
a
bit
of
booze
and
a
slightlydry
finish
a
bit
of
sweetness
decent
barleywine
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
brew
nothing
super
special
very
bitter
for
a
barleywine
definitely
try
if
you
have
access
and
like
hoppy
barleywines
i
honestly
expected
a
lot
more
flavor
all
considering
not
a
bad
brew
however
it
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
in
this
world
of
extreme
brews
it
doesnt
really
fit
in
however
i
do
see
it
as
a
balanced
staple
body
is
on
the
tinner
side
moderate
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
probably
wont
look
for
it
again
d
good
balance
a
decent
enough
english
barleywine
seems
to
be
lacking
some
of
the
malt
bomb
qualities
i
look
for
in
the
style
seems
to
be
stuck
somewhere
in
no
mans
land
between
the
english
and
american
style
interpretations
enjoyable
none
the
less
decent
mellow
flavor
fill
wasnt
too
badi
believe
it
was
somewhere
around
8
easier
to
reach
for
then
some
of
the
overly
sweet
things
you
see
in
the
english
bw
category
on
ba
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
it
might
not
be
the
best
ebw
out
there
but
its
solid
enough
to
be
worth
drinking
for
a
while
if
you
want
a
poundable
highoctane
beer
a
more
subdued
barleywine
than
what
youll
generally
find
in
the
states
noticeably
drier
than
the
norm
this
allows
the
earthy
hops
and
subtle
vinous
fruity
esters
to
be
highlighted
rather
than
big
sweet
malts
and
boozy
burn
not
tasting
any
traces
of
whiskey
flavors
as
this
is
said
to
have
been
aged
7
months
in
a
barrel
perhaps
some
wood
it
may
drink
clean
and
easy
but
it
left
me
wanting
some
more
malt
body
and
just
a
lil
more
sugar
representative
of
an
english
rather
than
american
barleywine
for
sure
d
drank
pretty
good
but
was
also
a
decent
barleywine
and
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
especially
with
the
positive
things
ive
heard
about
the
beer
i
picked
up
a
growler
for
the
super
bowl
split
with
3
friends
the
pour
is
deep
brown
with
a
medium
white
head
a
very
biscuity
aroma
sweet
some
alcohol
the
beer
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
backbone
biscuity
some
hot
alchol
it
has
a
lingering
smooth
finish
the
body
is
medium
and
it
is
way
too
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
a
nice
barley
wine
a
bit
too
pricey
but
very
good
d
not
as
good
as
the
barrel
aged
version
imo
but
a
damn
solid
beer
overall
have
a
few
more
in
the
cellar
so
we
will
see
where
this
one
goes
this
is
a
renoun
beer
for
stoudts
and
well
deserved
an
excellent
american
example
of
the
style
and
highly
recommended
definitely
one
for
fans
of
barleywine
it
wont
blow
your
mind
but
its
as
solid
as
they
come
a
little
age
may
mellow
it
out
some
more
pretty
well
beat
up
for
a
barleywine
approaching
four
years
old
d
pretty
good
overall
d
as
the
reviewer
before
me
noted
why
the
green
bottle
i
picked
this
up
because
my
wife
liked
the
label
when
i
pulled
it
out
for
a
barleywine
tasting
i
had
to
wonder
why
would
you
put
a
high
abv
brew
meant
for
aging
in
a
green
bottle
regardless
this
was
a
mediocre
beer
that
i
wont
be
picking
up
again
in
the
end
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
suffered
from
the
green
bottle
but
i
still
wonder
what
they
were
thinking
taste
starts
sweet
but
quickly
finds
fruit
and
bitterness
in
the
middle
with
the
bitterness
winning
out
at
the
close
alcohol
warmth
lingers
mouthfeel
is
rocky
with
alright
drinkability
this
one
just
doesnt
put
it
all
together
which
was
disappointing
after
the
good
start
on
tap
at
als
of
hampden
served
in
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
brown
color
with
minimal
white
lace
coating
the
surface
of
the
brew
nose
reminds
me
of
fruits
with
a
minimal
amount
of
maltgrain
aroma
but
includes
hints
of
a
dry
acsic
quality
almost
like
a
combination
of
pear
meets
green
apple
trace
amounts
of
hops
are
evident
in
the
scent
as
well
taste
is
slightly
bitter
upfront
but
transforms
to
a
very
dry
fruit
character
just
like
on
the
aroma
pears
and
apples
with
minimal
hop
impact
and
a
decent
alcohol
punch
slight
touch
of
sour
apple
in
the
finish
with
a
unique
slightly
tart
character
warmth
and
taste
of
the
alcohol
lingers
in
the
mouth
medium
feel
with
a
moderately
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
little
confused
by
their
take
on
the
style
the
acidic
quality
threw
me
for
a
loop
along
with
the
dryness
instead
of
malt
backing
first
time
having
a
nonbarrel
aged
version
of
this
beer
geez
that
3
year
vertical
last
summer
was
great
color
is
a
deep
clear
mahogany
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
is
supported
by
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
and
leaves
nice
lacing
and
has
great
retention
aroma
is
mild
lacking
any
hops
primarily
toasted
malt
slight
sweet
and
caramel
also
some
dark
fruits
flavor
is
predominantly
toasted
malt
and
plum
raisin
and
grape
dark
fruit
bittersweetness
some
remnants
of
citrus
hops
in
the
finish
but
very
little
hop
or
alcohol
presence
finish
also
has
a
mild
lingering
sourness
mediumfull
bodied
with
very
soft
carbonation
resulting
in
a
chewy
very
complex
and
balanced
not
an
over
the
top
hoppy
barleywine
but
recommended
if
you
come
across
it
while
i
didnt
find
this
to
anything
spectacular
it
was
still
an
easy
to
drink
barlewine
my
guess
is
that
some
short
term
againg
would
likely
improve
this
beer
considerably

drinkability
is
decent
above
average
for
the
style
overall
but
not
great
md
tame
and
easy
a
nice
strong
medium
bodied
with
faded
carb
making
for
a
smooth
sipper
although
i
drank
mine
a
bit
quick
because
it
was
easy
for
a
barleywine
not
a
huge
abv
on
this
compared
to
other
bws
making
this
much
more
approachable
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
a
quick
drinker
pours
clear
copper
with
microscopic
tan
head
the
aroma
is
malty
to
caramel
sweet
to
go
along
with
some
raisins
prunes
and
a
mild
level
of
pine
hops
the
taste
is
neutral
to
start
and
then
moves
into
sweetness
with
sweet
sugary
malts
prunes
raisins
and
figs
it
seems
to
thin
out
a
bit
by
midway
with
more
dark
fruitiness
and
brown
sugar
tasty
stuff
this
barleywine
has
held
up
well
over
the
years
and
it
was
easy
drinking
as
far
as
the
style
goes
nothing
stands
out
on
this
one
but
its
a
wellbalanced
beer
overall
d
its
a
sipper
not
my
favorite
barleywine
a
decent
flavor
profile
on
this
barleywine
with
suggestions
of
creamed
toffee
caramel
plum
vanilla
and
a
bitter
finish
of
resinous
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
packs
a
nice
carbonation
level
to
complement
its
crisp
smooth
body
overall
a
good
interpretation
of
the
english
barleywine
style
and
a
beer
id
gladly
have
again
overall
a
very
good
and
different
version
of
a
barleywine
its
nice
every
now
and
then
to
have
a
barleywine
that
does
not
kill
you
with
hops
this
is
one
of
them
ah
well
better
luck
next
time
a
good
drinking
barleywine
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
oaked
age
one
thanks
again
dwonderful
stuff
amazing
amount
of
hop
character
for
a
brew
that
is
3
years
old
i
was
pleased
to
share
this
one
around
the
table
with
friends
d
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
this
one
really
aged
quite
nicely
and
still
retained
a
lot
of
its
hop
character
pours
a
cloudy
redish
orange
color
with
foamy
white
head
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
lots
of
alcohol
flavor
is
pretty
well
balance
with
a
lot
of
bitter
hops
and
a
nice
amount
of
malt
to
balance
out
the
strong
sweet
alcohol
presence
on
tap
at
blind
tiger
deep
hazy
amber
color
with
significant
white
head
after
drinking
captain
lawrence
smoke
from
the
oak
an
initial
sniff
and
taste
of
this
was
very
hoppy
and
floral
once
my
palate
readjusted
i
thought
this
was
a
very
well
rounded
barleywine
with
very
strong
malts
and
lots
of
sweetness
poured
into
my
corsendonk
christmas
ale
glass
a
nice
golden
amber
color
very
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
fizzy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
nice
little
touch
of
figs
raisins
plums
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
at
first
malty
with
some
nice
notes
of
dark
fruits
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
english
style
barleywine
recommended
overall
i
thought
this
was
excellent
really
a
very
nice
effort
here
and
one
of
the
better
aged
barley
wines
i
have
had
in
a
god
long
while
wish
i
had
access
to
more
of
this
as
it
was
really
good
and
probably
would
have
held
up
at
least
another
year
or
so
drinkability
not
the
best
barleywine
out
there
thats
for
sure
some
are
moreish
leaving
you
eager
for
the
next
sip
this
keeps
you
sipping
just
to
be
finished
with
it
slightly
hazy
deep
red
colour
with
beige
foam
good
head
retention
with
a
bit
of
lace
hoppy
aroma
with
grapefruit
and
citrus
peel
oranges
toffee
and
lots
of
figraisin
character
moderate
bitterness
with
citrusy
hops
throughout
fruity
flavour
with
caramel
and
toffee
malts
mild
alcohol
and
a
weird
yeasty
bite
full
bodied
with
light
warmth
and
lowish
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
i
was
able
to
share
this
bottle
with
my
best
friend
who
was
in
town
this
goes
with
my
new
years
resolution
to
try
more
barleywines
because
honestly
i
really
dont
like
the
style
ok
on
to
the
review
the
beer
pours
a
brownish
amber
with
a
huge
off
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
average
nothing
spectacular
there
are
hints
of
the
malt
backbone
but
nothing
really
is
overwhelming
hints
of
raisins
pepper
and
wheat
husks
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
unfortunately
the
burnt
grain
husk
taste
is
actually
over
powering
the
malt
backbone
to
this
beer
also
it
kind
of
makes
my
tongue
numb
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
think
think
a
good
dimetapp
in
how
it
coats
your
mouth
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
this
beer
out
again
but
if
you
do
like
barleywines
give
this
baby
a
try
see
if
i
am
wrong
and
balance
out
my
opinion
of
it
this
beer
was
really
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
was
very
nice
flavors
are
very
subtle
compared
to
its
american
counterparts
recommended
if
you
have
the
25
bucks
to
buy
a
bottle
sorry
to
bring
down
the
average
on
this
one
folks
but
this
is
very
odd
for
an
english
barleywine
this
to
me
seem
very
american
in
style
and
somewhat
light
even
for
that
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
with
pretty
good
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nose
is
weak
hops
with
a
good
malty
backbone
taste
is
defenitey
american
barleywine
just
seems
toned
down
to
me
decent
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
good
drinkability
but
lacking
in
flavor
especially
when
catagorized
as
english
bw
good
beer
for
sure
just
seems
like
a
barleywine
flavored
session
ale
in
taste
excited
to
see
if
the
barrel
aged
version
is
better
d
im
usually
good
for
one
a
night
only
but
i
had
two
of
these
on
two
consecutive
nights
notes
i
seem
to
have
rated
this
much
lower
than
most
i
wonder
if
this
beer
was
contaminated
d
quite
drinkable
very
very
smooth
and
pleasant
which
isnt
always
the
case
with
a
750
of
such
a
big
beer
d
the
abv
is
high
and
you
can
feel
it
midway
through
a
dinner
bottle
the
grain
flavors
are
strong
and
nicely
define
the
ale
good
for
a
cold
night
this
is
a
great
american
style
barleywine
with
an
assertive
hop
presence
that
seems
to
come
out
even
more
on
cask
get
this
at
the
brewpub
while
you
can
d
a
fine
cask
ale
w
nice
smoothness
and
easy
to
imbibe
characteristices
the
cask
conditioning
improved
the
flavor
w
subtleties
over
the
oak
barrel
version
for
my
taste
wow
good
times
good
times
drinkability
this
one
is
a
bit
boosy
beware
past
draft
at
bocktown
beer
and
grill
since
the
burgh
didnt
receive
any
bottles
i
was
thrilled
to
see
this
tap
handle
instead
appears
a
cloudy
ruby
amber
brown
and
it
forms
with
a
large
cream
hued
head
that
leaves
thick
lacing
all
around
my
chalice
aromatics
contain
vanilla
and
oak
notes
with
herbal
pine
and
citrus
fruit
along
with
a
mild
spicy
tartness
thats
kind
of
hard
to
nail
down
completely
flavor
is
somewhat
mild
compared
to
other
barleywines
out
there
everything
blended
pretty
well
mild
alcohol
with
a
mix
of
ripe
fruit
and
deep
herbal
citrus
hop
edges
brings
it
all
together
no
cloying
malt
sweetness
but
sturdy
stand
up
caramel
malt
edges
were
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
not
cloying
or
syrupy
yet
enough
body
to
get
it
done
moderate
carbonation
allows
this
beer
to
flow
well
drinkability
takes
a
few
to
get
this
beer
after
you
get
it
though
beware
its
hard
to
stay
away
from
good
barleywine
draft
offering
from
the
folks
in
adamstown
pa
drinkability
impressively
drinkable
for
a
barley
wine
i
had
two
pints
and
they
went
down
almost
too
easy
a
drinkable
beer
though
definitely
a
sipping
beer
good
to
finish
off
on
a
cold
night
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
light
syrup
the
smoothest
barleywine
that
i
remember
having
especially
being
this
young
overall
its
a
nice
tasting
slightly
sweet
brew
with
an
oakiness
that
seems
to
take
over
the
brew
obviously
the
drinkability
suffers
from
the
high
abv
and
intense
flavors
cheers
from
the
cellar
bottled
013108
ages
really
well
lacking
some
carbonation
but
great
smell
outstanding
flavor
and
mouthfeel
worthy
of
cellar
space
no
booziness
at
all
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
believe
barley
wine
ages
ok
bottle
is
from
nov
iv
13
so
hopefully
so
nice
to
try
something
different
but
not
really
my
thing
3750
overall
wow
this
is
a
great
ale
and
barleywine
very
solid
flavors
and
great
big
beer
presence
without
off
flavors
or
extremes
a
nice
sipper
well
balanced
with
a
well
hidden
abv
however
not
as
complex
as
most
barleywines
o
this
is
a
barleywine
for
barleywine
lovers
its
boozy
kind
of
challenging
but
drinkable
to
those
who
can
handle
it
its
a
fantastic
aging
candidate
too
bad
the
twistoff
cap
is
going
to
oxidize
it
too
quickly
overall
good
to
really
good
beer
basically
somewhere
in
the
middle
i
would
definitely
try
this
beer
i
dont
know
how
it
drinks
fresh
but
it
definitely
doesnt
mind
some
age
lacks
a
little
bit
of
complexity
but
its
a
good
take
on
the
style
not
remarkable
but
worth
drinking
o
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
english
barleywine
there
was
some
mild
oxidation
but
did
not
distract
from
the
overall
experience
and
overall
held
up
very
well
after
5
years
o
i
love
how
balanced
and
smooth
this
beer
is
its
also
easily
drinkable
even
with
the
alcohol
content
being
so
high
definitely
a
beer
youd
want
to
drink
on
a
cold
day
its
my
favorite
barleywine
to
date
it
is
fullbodied
and
very
smooth
drinks
too
easily
for
its
alcohol
level
and
richness
this
is
a
wellbalanced
wellmade
enjoyable
barleywine
o
quite
a
nice
surprise
an
excellent
barleywine
and
a
bargain
to
boot
o
a
very
light
yet
tasty
and
fairly
complex
barleywine
nicely
aged
i
think
this
is
at
its
peak
this
poured
out
as
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
on
top
the
retention
is
pretty
good
as
well
as
the
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
floral
and
citrusy
hops
with
some
mild
malt
sweetness
on
the
nose
the
taste
had
a
powerful
bitterness
and
sweetness
blended
together
the
mouthfeel
had
a
medium
body
it
also
has
a
solid
amount
of
carbonation
as
well
overall
this
beer
to
be
seemed
more
like
an
american
barley
wine
than
an
english
one
its
a
very
nice
beer
though
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
d
very
drinkable
i
would
happily
celebrate
my
birthday
today
by
having
three
or
four
of
these
and
then
regretting
it
tomorrow
alas
this
is
the
only
one
in
my
cellar
this
is
a
great
barleywine
and
a
great
present
to
me
o
color
me
impressed
a
very
solid
english
barleywine
with
plenty
of
body
and
flavor
not
too
much
boozy
presence
after
warming
but
a
bit
is
there
with
a
high
abv
here
very
well
done
imo
o
it
is
really
an
average
barleywine
o
this
10
5
abv
english
barleywine
is
a
treat
to
be
taken
in
moderation
it
could
stand
to
age
a
bit
and
some
oakaging
would
send
this
beer
into
rare
territory
until
then
its
a
complex
very
boozy
beautiful
looking
sipper
cheers
overall
a
real
very
impressive
barleywine
probably
made
for
the
hop
heads
but
i
cant
get
over
this
nose
and
appearance
awesome
not
perfect
and
showing
its
age
so
i
wouldnt
wait
any
longer
a
damn
good
english
bw
thats
worth
putting
some
time
into
o
good
barleywine
but
the
happiness
is
more
of
the
american
barleywine
than
english
o
a
great
barleywine
one
that
should
be
captured
and
stored
the
honey
really
works
well
great
with
cheddar
robust
and
satisfying
thanks
evan
great
beer
overall
eh
just
average
for
the
style
it
goes
straight
to
your
head
though
o
i
loved
this
it
saddens
me
that
this
brewery
no
longer
exists
we
have
to
enjoy
what
we
have
left
overall
a
barleywine
of
moderate
strength
not
as
complex
as
some
but
gets
the
message
accross
i
love
a
strong
ale
and
this
fits
that
bill
i
picked
this
up
on
a
growler
sunday
at
mellow
mushroom
in
charlottesville
they
have
great
selection
and
excellent
prices
on
sunday
anyway
this
is
a
delightful
beer
that
packs
a
heavy
punch
it
is
a
lovely
caramel
color
with
a
sweet
sweet
smell
and
taste
i
scored
it
higher
on
mouthfeel
because
it
has
that
strong
barleywine
feel
that
welcomes
the
beer
as
soon
as
it
hits
the
pallet
old
dominion
nailed
this
one
dark
amber
in
appearance
the
smell
is
good
with
a
nice
hint
of
honey
the
smell
is
of
time
sweetened
honey
the
finish
is
good
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
surpising
nice
taste
well
we
have
said
it
this
is
a
real
good
barley
wine
and
for
us
here
at
barley
road
we
love
this
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
is
worth
having
and
is
fridge
worth
hans
is
in
love
let
us
have
a
cigar
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
the
11
is
integrated
very
well
even
while
the
brew
gets
above
ideal
temperature
for
being
9
years
old
this
brew
has
held
up
quite
well
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
thanks
again
dan
o
a
pretty
good
english
barleywine
i
find
myself
going
back
and
forth
between
preferring
english
and
american
a
slow
sipper
where
one
bottle
is
enough
aroma
is
light
hints
of
vanilla
light
leather
and
bourbon
are
the
most
pronounced
really
rich
smelling
and
the
alcohol
is
coming
through
clearly
evidence
of
the
barrel
dominates
everything
this
is
a
good
thing
and
even
an
hour
into
this
bottle
that
sweet
vanilla
aroma
is
mixing
with
an
almost
toffee
like
touch
and
a
hint
of
plum
smooth
rich
flavor
washes
across
the
tongue
with
a
splash
the
bourbon
comes
right
up
and
grabs
me
leather
tobacco
and
dark
almost
spicy
like
notes
wrapping
around
the
tongue
splash
of
alcohol
and
a
flash
of
a
buttery
finish
and
its
gone
enjoyable
beer
flavor
and
aroma
are
well
developed
for
a
younger
beer
characteristics
meet
my
expectations
of
an
english
barleywine
millennium
is
a
sipper
without
a
doubt
as
you
get
down
to
the
bottle
of
the
glass
the
alcohol
starts
to
take
effect
one
bottle
is
certainly
sufficient
for
a
sitting
from
the
label
i
see
this
is
not
the
original
millenium
ale
and
is
obviously
a
cheaper
knockoff
imo
d
so
strong
in
so
many
ways
it
begins
to
take
a
toll
on
the
senses
wouldnt
want
to
drink
another
one
right
then
but
could
definitely
have
another
one
the
next
night
and
the
next
ect
its
really
a
good
strong
beer
with
lots
of
everything
including
lots
of
balance
i
really
really
liked
this
beer
it
had
a
nice
clear
copper
color
when
poured
but
not
much
head
nice
lacing
though
i
smelled
a
lot
but
it
gave
me
a
strong
sense
of
softness
vanilla
toffee
and
butter
the
taste
was
great
a
definite
barleywine
with
enough
hops
to
make
it
taste
somewhere
between
english
and
american
styles
would
i
have
it
again
hell
yes
i
will
also
accept
all
donations
from
the
company
one
note
i
noticed
above
the
abv
is
listed
as
11
4
but
my
bottle
has
10
5
clearly
this
beer
ages
well
which
is
evident
from
the
5
years
on
it
i
would
really
enjoy
trying
this
one
fresh
to
see
how
it
compares
its
a
very
good
english
barleywine
and
worth
checking
out
drinkabilityoverall
good
d
english
barleywines
are
rapidly
becoming
my
favorite
style
just
a
nice
complex
sipper
and
this
one
is
spot
on
with
the
rest
of
em
i
almost
like
them
fresh
nice
and
sweet
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
the
surface
the
aromatics
when
the
head
is
present
are
extraordinarily
fruity
in
nature
i
get
strong
notes
of
pineapple
and
mango
when
the
head
subsides
the
pineapple
remains
but
it
is
equaled
in
potency
by
the
caramel
and
light
toffee
notes
the
flavors
on
the
tongue
are
rather
similar
but
rather
than
a
toffee
there
is
more
a
butterscotch
with
the
caramel
and
pineapple
its
definitely
a
unique
beer
flavor
wise
as
ive
never
tasted
anything
similar
to
it
texturally
the
body
is
a
firm
medium
thats
not
boozy
in
the
slightest
and
goes
down
nice
and
easy
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
im
surprised
that
it
comes
out
of
a
brewery
in
delaware
that
ive
never
heard
of
im
rather
impressed
by
it
d
once
i
warmed
up
to
the
overwhelming
sugar
content
this
actually
became
very
drinkable
to
me
ill
say
it
again
i
miss
having
the
old
dominion
brewery
and
alehouse
in
my
area
pours
a
dark
copper
with
one
finger
of
sticky
tan
head
with
good
retention
aromas
are
too
obviously
alcoholic
with
sweet
toffeelike
malts
and
faintly
floral
hops
not
nearly
hoppy
enough
failing
to
enter
the
foreground
the
taste
however
is
right
on
the
money
this
beer
is
extremely
rich
complex
and
about
as
fullbodied
and
heavy
yet
smooth
as
they
come
chewy
flavors
of
toffee
and
caramel
dominate
the
front
and
midpalates
and
are
quite
wellbalanced
by
orange
citrusy
hops
the
finish
is
somewhat
medicinal
with
intense
brownsugar
and
cherry
flavors
that
first
shock
and
then
haunt
the
palate
for
nearly
a
minute
afterward
overall
i
love
it
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
i
am
puzzled
reading
others
reviews
dominion
millennium
ale
is
an
impressive
english
barleywine
this
bottle
is
approaching
five
years
old
and
is
very
refined
i
havent
had
it
fresh
so
i
cant
say
from
experience
but
the
flavors
are
very
well
integrated
in
addition
to
the
alcohol
im
still
not
sure
i
buy
that
this
is
11
its
not
perfect
more
body
would
really
be
a
good
thing
as
well
as
a
bump
in
aromatics
oh
yeah
no
head
at
all
nevertheless
this
is
one
tasty
english
barleywine
find
a
bottle
thanks
a
ton
chris
this
is
a
good
beer
and
glad
to
try
it
it
is
nothing
i
will
have
to
go
tell
my
fellow
bas
about
or
anything
though
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
not
one
to
seek
out
with
so
many
other
top
shelf
brews
to
pick
from
the
redeeming
quality
with
this
brew
is
the
warming
effect
and
of
course
the
alcohol
that
creates
the
warmth
i
would
expect
a
2008
english
barleywine
to
be
much
more
attractive
than
this
d
the
10
5
which
is
what
my
bottle
reads
is
no
surprise
and
the
beer
is
supremely
sippable
as
barleywines
go
very
good
recommended
pours
brownish
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
reddish
tint
off
white
head
that
has
decent
lasting
power
nose
is
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
caramel
dark
fruits
cherries
and
a
few
hop
notes
taste
adds
a
bit
of
booze
and
is
slightly
sweetened
decent
feel
and
carbonation
this
is
pretty
good
right
now
though
ive
got
another
bottle
and
hope
it
ages
fairly
well
my
wife
was
correct
as
usual
this
is
a
very
good
brew
tightroping
along
near
excellent
handsdown
the
most
drinkable
straightup
english
barleywine
ive
ever
downright
dangerous
and
now
im
really
looking
forward
to
the
single
bottle
of
the
oaked
version
i
just
recd
d
a
slightly
better
than
average
representation
of
the
style
moderate
complexity
with
a
feel
i
can
really
appreciate
even
though
it
does
seem
a
bit
thin
still
worth
a
try
if
it
crosses
your
path
drinkability
isnt
bad
drinks
well
for
10
abv
and
dries
well
for
how
sweet
it
started
but
leaves
a
sticky
resin
all
over
the
mouth
and
the
weird
hop
flavor
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
lingers
for
a
long
time
this
beer
pours
with
an
intense
red
colour
and
holds
its
head
extremely
well
it
smells
strongly
of
hops
and
taosty
malts
this
beer
tastes
strongly
of
honey
and
concentrated
sweet
hops
and
an
aftertaste
of
bitter
hops
and
the
alcohol
this
beer
is
thick
and
carbonated
in
the
mouth
very
nice
d
carbonation
adds
to
the
drinkability
the
palate
mirrors
the
nose
opening
with
mellow
sherrylike
oxidation
and
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
flavors
lend
complexity
bringing
to
mind
figs
or
dates
surprisingly
its
still
mildly
hoppy
just
enough
to
balance
the
malt
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
finish
is
leathery
earthy
semidry
and
very
mellow
this
is
quite
good
it
reminds
me
a
fair
bit
of
aged
jw
lees
harvest
ale
highly
recommended
a
killer
brew
we
have
here
no
need
to
cellar
as
its
perfect
to
drink
right
now
balanced
and
a
bit
too
drinkable
for
its
size
this
one
gets
very
high
regards
from
us
its
worth
seeking
out
and
stocking
up
if
you
can
find
it
overall
not
that
impressive
it
smells
great
but
in
the
end
fails
to
deliver
pours
copper
with
a
slight
head
smells
tannic
and
clean
with
some
fruitiness
as
well
tastes
like
iced
black
tea
tannic
a
little
smokey
and
oaky
with
just
a
touch
of
fruit
austere
but
quite
tasty
and
unusual
chewy
and
smokey
in
the
mouth
not
fantastic
but
good
enough
to
have
now
and
again
overall
impression
needs
aged
a
big
english
barleywine
nicely
done

hmm
not
totally
sure
what
to
think
on
the
taste
here
the
carbonation
is
light
its
actually
pretty
good
for
the
style
a
bit
sharp
but
not
over
the
top
there
is
certainly
some
booze
on
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
a
graininess
to
it
as
well
fairly
drinkable
for
the
abv
as
well
d
pretty
high
in
alcohol
at
10
5
a
bit
of
warmth
is
noticeable
and
quite
full
bodied
all
add
up
to
being
a
sipper
but
a
pretty
good
sipper
this
is
definitely
young
at
only
2
months
since
bottling
pretty
good
now
but
i
think
this
will
only
get
better
with
a
little
bit
of
aging
hops
could
settle
down
a
bit
and
hopefully
some
age
wil
bring
out
more
of
the
malt
in
aroma
and
flavor
and
cut
back
the
alcohol
heat
a
little
bit
in
the
process
good
now
if
you
have
more
than
one
bottle
definitely
let
some
of
these
sit
around
a
little
while
and
collect
some
dust
2010
vintage
well
rounded
for
such
a
fresh
barleywine
caramel
sweetness
up
front
with
a
boozy
punch
in
the
middle
the
alcohol
needs
a
bit
more
time
to
mellow
out
it
seems
sweetness
fades
toward
the
end
with
a
firm
bittering
and
a
touch
of
astringency
should
improve
with
a
year
under
its
belt
medium
body
somewhat
astringent
medium
carbonation
a
decent
barleywine
but
it
just
doesnt
compare
to
some
of
the
better
offerings
available
around
here
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
but
still
a
balanced
and
wellrounded
beer
millennium
ale
is
a
delicious
ale
that
has
a
perfect
amount
of
funk
and
sweet
after
drinking
this
ale
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
senses
have
had
an
experience
10
5
alcohol
hoping
for
a
bit
more
bang
overall
i
like
dominion
beers
but
this
was
not
my
favorite
it
tasted
better
as
time
went
on
temperature
may
have
been
a
factor
the
feel
was
a
bit
thick
sopranos
is
some
good
beer
tasting
programming
and
due
to
the
nature
of
the
beer
it
was
a
good
choice
d
overall
i
thought
this
barleywine
was
ok
but
nothing
great
i
thought
the
alcohol
just
dominated
the
taste
which
was
unappealing
to
me
i
tend
to
like
barleywines
that
are
smootherhide
their
high
abv
well
id
be
interested
to
cellar
this
and
revisit
it
further
on
up
the
road
cloudy
amber
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
hops
and
fruits
taste
is
honeydark
fruitshops
and
alcohol
the
abv
on
my
bottle
says
10
5
and
the
label
is
different
but
from
what
i
read
this
is
probably
the
same
thing
this
is
not
a
beer
meant
for
party
games
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
pours
a
dark
and
murky
ruby
brown
with
a
halffinger
of
bubbly
ecru
head
that
leaves
highly
transitory
lacing
the
honey
comes
through
in
the
nose
along
with
some
figs
some
apricots
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
and
a
fairly
healthy
dose
of
alcohol
the
sweet
notes
from
the
nose
do
come
through
on
the
tongue
but
they
are
overpowered
by
a
bland
wheatiness
and
an
overtly
heavy
dose
of
alcohol
the
balance
is
far
too
asymmetrical
in
favor
of
the
latter
a
heavy
body
that
thickly
coats
the
tongue
while
appropriate
and
usually
nice
for
barleywines
does
not
help
the
drinkability
in
this
case
as
it
enhances
the
negatives
of
the
taste
overall
a
downer
but
not
quite
a
failure
overall
this
beer
held
up
very
well
and
was
pleasing
to
drink
after
a
long
work
week
beers
like
these
give
me
hope
that
the
rest
of
the
stuff
in
my
cellar
will
hold
up
pours
a
honey
orange
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
good
stickage
on
the
glass
a
very
sweet
nose
caramel
sweet
potato
rich
dark
fruits
and
a
leafy
minty
aroma
tame
carbonation
to
be
expected
from
something
nearly
8
years
old
very
full
in
body
malt
forward
with
zero
alcohol
heat
very
glad
to
have
tried
an
offering
this
old
this
has
stood
up
to
the
time
wonderfully
notes
hmmm
drank
barely
14
days
after
bottling
hops
are
already
fairly
well
integrated
in
fact
a
bit
too
shy
if
anything
i
guess
that
the
boozy
edge
may
subside
with
aging
and
meld
nicely
the
move
of
the
brewery
to
delaware
as
part
of
a
macro
takeover
still
bothers
me
when
i
reach
out
to
these
brews
in
particular
as
they
brag
about
their
small
guy
origing
and
the
hype
for
the
small
amount
of
cases
distributed
to
the
region
seems
but
a
trite
marketing
ploy
luckily
it
is
a
fair
barleywine
disappointing
seems
past
its
prime
less
than
three
years
in
for
a
barleywine
of
11
4
abv
this
should
have
held
up
better
drink
within
two
years
44

its
an
easy
one
to
drink
as
far
as
barleywines
go
its
not
overly
thick
and
oily
which
would
help
its
drinkability
throw
in
the
fact
that
the
11
40abv
is
very
hard
to
find
and
this
is
one
nice
beer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
its
a
little
thin
on
the
flavor
and
not
quite
complex
enough
to
be
an
elite
barleywine
either
way
its
very
tasty
and
big
thanks
to
chris
for
the
opportunity
d
although
the
alcohol
is
present
it
doesnt
weigh
on
the
ale
age
hasnt
hurt
this
ale
at
all
taste
at
first
is
a
shy
malted
feeling
then
followedd
by
a
heavy
bitter
body
hoppy
but
well
balanced
some
fruity
esters
are
present
some
butter
feels
also
some
touches
of
pines
oranges
fresh
and
sharp
alcohol
taste
followed
by
caramel
finish
contains
a
substantial
amount
of
sweet
honey
a
bitter
amber
maltyness
and
various
components
of
violet
floral
flavors
and
a
straightforward
earthiness
good
finish
but
not
so
sharp
in
the
taste
and
balance
many
believe
honey
is
a
natural
health
remedy
well
this
is
certainly
good
for
what
ales
ya
hearty
har
har
but
seriously
the
floral
earthy
character
of
honey
is
an
ideal
accompaniment
to
similar
qualities
in
the
hops
as
well
as
the
syrupy
sweetness
of
the
malts
the
folks
at
dominion
brewed
a
nice
little
beer
to
celebrate
their
1000th
batch
its
a
good
thing
they
had
the
good
sense
to
keep
brewing
it
now
i
wish
id
put
away
some
later
versions
drinkability
although
this
bottle
spent
a
little
too
long
in
my
cellar
it
still
retains
a
nice
flavor
profile
for
an
english
ipa
without
the
carbonation
it
has
become
a
bit
too
syrupy
grabbed
this
one
on
tap
at
the
old
dominion
brewhouse
hoping
it
would
beat
the
mess
that
was
this
barleywine
in
the
bottle
it
did
thankfully
but
still
not
a
particularly
impressive
offering
in
the
style
alcoholy
again
with
lots
of
caramel
malt
and
light
spiciness
i
dunno
two
tries
is
enough
for
me
on
this
one
although
ill
wait
for
the
other
two
bottles
to
age
for
a
couple
years
to
see
if
the
alcohol
eases
up
drinkability
at
this
stage
its
still
a
bit
coarse
and
unrefined
but
its
basically
good
though
it
does
make
me
more
than
wistful
for
a
bottle
of
j
w
lees
harvest
ale
or
hell
one
of
my
older
bottles
of
oak
barrelaged
millennium
im
just
sayin
i
dont
normally
think
of
english
barleywines
as
a
drinkable
brew
and
this
certainly
is
no
session
but
i
find
myself
reaching
for
the
glass
to
sniff
and
sip
way
too
frequently
that
is
drinkability
to
me
overall
i
dont
know
what
i
would
want
to
change
in
this
from
what
it
is
boozy
and
sweet
and
i
dig
it
pours
a
very
clear
amber
copper
color
head
was
normal
for
a
high
alcohol
ale
poured
in
to
middle
of
the
glass
and
formed
a
pretty
good
head
aroma
was
great
and
smelled
of
sweet
malt
and
a
nice
set
of
hops
the
taste
of
this
ale
was
great
as
the
sweet
malts
rushed
in
the
front
with
hops
and
fruits
in
the
background
excellent
balance
on
all
grounds
mouthfeel
was
great
and
alcohol
level
was
hidden
very
well
will
continue
to
stock
this
brew
thanks
to
my
buddy
chaz
over
at
realbeer
for
this
one
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
basic
snifter
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
golden
chestnut
color
with
about
a
finger
of
tightly
packed
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
sweet
brown
sugar
coated
raisins
and
figs
a
hint
of
vanilla
spiked
toffee
biscuits
and
dark
cherries
creamy
and
smooth
the
alcohol
bite
has
faded
considerably
making
this
quite
drinkable
on
the
whole
this
is
a
fine
english
barleywine
more
than
a
couple
would
be
too
much
for
a
night
that
does
not
take
anything
away
from
its
drinkability
however
this
is
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
and
in
moderation
i
am
currently
aging
one
and
cant
wait
to
compare
it
to
this
relatively
new
sample
in
a
year
or
so
not
impressed
plus
points
for
the
beer
executing
the
english
style
texture
extremely
well
minus
points
for
the
sweetness
and
the
drinkability
much
too
sweet
for
me
i
cant
imagine
it
aging
any
better
either
as
the
sweetness
will
be
overpowering
at
some
point
drinkability
too
good
for
a
brew
this
strong
but
i
wont
dock
it
for
that
flaw
im
very
happy
i
got
a
chance
to
try
and
and
im
very
happy
with
it
a
darned
good
brew
usually
barleywines
are
slow
slow
sippers
for
me
and
this
is
definately
not
a
beer
you
would
want
to
pound
but
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
would
not
drink
two
or
three
but
i
would
drink
one
a
night
for
a
few
weeks
if
given
the
opportunity
drinkability
a
great
example
of
the
style
that
i
was
ignorant
of
until
i
stumbled
upon
the
oddlylabeled
bottle
at
total
im
surprised
i
enjoy
the
sweetness
as
much
as
i
do
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
friend
id
love
to
score
a
few
more
bottles
to
lay
down
even
longer
solid
barleywine
in
my
opinion
highly
visible
carbonation
its
deep
clear
amberbrown
with
a
tiny
head
nose
is
strong
layers
of
malts
some
hops
poke
through
with
a
mild
grass
scent
but
malts
dominate
and
do
a
little
sweet
dance
taste
is
a
malt
bomb
musty
grains
subdued
sweetness
raw
qualities
not
exactly
true
to
style
but
quite
good
nonetheless
alcohol
impressively
well
hidden
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
only
hampered
by
the
abv
m
d
a
nice
bigbodied
big
alcohol
beer
as
it
should
be
though
the
abv
listing
on
this
bottle
is
now
10
5
rather
than
the
11
4
noted
here
so
its
a
bit
of
a
modification
to
the
recipe
i
would
be
interested
in
seeing
how
this
held
up
with
a
little
age
as
it
could
get
some
interesting
flavours
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
hopefully
its
something
i
can
continue
to
get
in
the
future
with
the
brewery
going
through
the
transition
very
nice
and
perhaps
one
of
my
favourite
barleywines
good
level
of
carbonation
has
a
nice
level
of
interplay
with
the
alcohol
it
is
a
thick
beer
with
a
bit
of
chewiness
but
everything
goes
down
a
bit
too
smooth
given
the
abv
nonetheless
very
much
a
sipper
and
the
abv
is
more
than
noticeable
in
the
taste

d
i
could
sip
this
all
night
for
sure
the
abv
leads
to
a
lower
drinkability
but
the
flavors
are
outstanding
a
great
dessert
beer
and
apertifnightcap
drinkability
apparently
its
11
but
doesnt
taste
it
ah
barleywines
could
have
a
couple
d
a
nice
way
to
end
the
evening
but
having
more
than
one
isnt
really
an
option
well
done
dominion
d
for
the
style
would
hurt
myself
probably
poured
a
dark
copper
body
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
sheath
lacing
down
the
glass
a
thick
malt
ad
yeastlike
smell
with
some
dark
fruit
in
there
mediumbodied
yet
smooth
and
creamy
definite
caramel
and
toffee
malts
as
well
as
bread
roasted
and
some
oakiness
this
leads
to
a
balanced
beer
that
has
a
dry
taste
but
finishes
more
smooth
has
fruits
like
apple
and
pear
poking
at
the
side
but
they
seemed
subdued
especially
for
a
barleywine
the
abv
is
really
hidden
here
and
i
could
see
myself
mistakenly
sessioning
this
definitely
worth
a
try
even
if
youre
not
a
barleywine
fan
d
this
is
tasty
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
tiptoe
around
this
one
gets
right
after
you
with
a
nice
warming
character
its
a
sipper
but
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
barleywine
from
dominion
like
many
of
their
beers
especially
easy
to
appreciate
given
the
reasonable
pricing
poured
into
a
westmalle
glass
bottling
date
is
blank
pours
out
mohogony
color
with
a
think
off
white
head
that
goes
away
quickly
smell
is
very
sweet
can
definatly
find
the
honey
taste
is
the
honey
flowing
across
your
pallate
with
a
roasted
malt
flavor
to
follow
hardly
any
hop
bite
to
it
which
in
this
case
isnt
a
bad
thing
not
much
if
any
carbonation
to
the
mouthfeel
but
a
very
smooth
feel
as
well
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
to
make
this
a
very
drinkable
barley
wine
this
is
a
standout

the

were

awesome
d
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not

filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
high
abv
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
its
not
the
first
one
id
pick
pours
a
nice
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
that
left
some
slight
lacing
aroma
was
loads
of
burnt
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
was
also
a
load
of
burnt
caramel
and
an
abundance
of
malts
with
the
hops
keeping
a
decent
balance
in
the
background
the
beer
is
slightly
heavy
with
warming
slightly
sticky
alcohol
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
one
id
certainly
try
again
poured
a
nice
clear
dark
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
almost
nothing
nose
is
malty
as

very
nice
lots
of
malts
that

slight

very
slight
chocolate
and
smoke
very
easy
to
drink
doesnt
shout
at
you
drinkability
alcohols
up
there
but
masterfully
hidden
whether
due
to
the
fashion
in
which
it
was
brewed
or
the
melding
of
flavors
with
age
i
barely
noticed
it
a
small
amount
of
this
brew
monster
goes
a
long
way
it
looks
pretty
good
for
starters
with
a
beautiful
thick
head
floating
atop
a
cloudy
brown
brew
producing
a
wonderful
lacing
down
the
glass
as
you
slowly
sip
it
the
nose
is
pretty
up
front
with
a
strong
sweet
malt
the
brew
is
quite
thick
in
your
mouth
which
spreads
the
sweet
brew
across
your
palate
nicely
accompanied
by
a
hefty
hop
kick
the
bitterness
stays
with
you
long
after
youve
finished
the
draft
not
bad
for
a
dessert
beer
but
im
coming
back
for
more
when
its
winter
this
one
would
be
a
great
warmer
on
one
of
those
cold
and
humid
washington
winter
nights
d
too
drinkable
for
this
abv
so
i
had
to
give
it
some
credit
for
it

dominated
by
rich

the

leads
me
to
believe
this
is
a
malt
bomb
of
a
barleywine
up

alcohol
in
the

off

quickly
full
of

enough

keep
it
from
being
too

hops
are
floral

and
leafy
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
for
an

good
beer
thanks
to
doulos31
for
the
bottle
2008
bottled
version
on
020108
to
be
exact
the
label
says
100
ibus
after
a
nice
heavy
pour
it
forms
a
thicket
of
orange
tinted
cream
head
with
even
lacing
aspread
across
the
pints
glass
with
each
sip
of
this
pale
amber
hazed
barleywine
btw
new
label
and
ab
influence
adds
to
my
anticipation
of
this
sample
i
have
to
say
it
smells
incredible
with
loads
of
fresh
hop
notes
bursting
out
in
a
perfume
and
floral
like
presence
to
my
seneses
also
that
honey
addition
the
label
mentions
with
the
premium
ale
thats
so
ab
layers
of
malt
sweetness
and
mild
oak
barrel
charred
qualities
make
me
happy
again
caramel
and
butterscotch
notes
rise
to
the
occasion
carrying
out
a
very
big
barleywine
bitterness
hits
hard
the
ibus
are
definitely
kicking
with
pine
floral
and
mild
citrus
notes
bitterness
is
raw
and
raucous
with
some
balance
to
it
this
is
one
of
the
hoppier
beers
in
recent
memory
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syurp
like
in
texture
big
streaks
of
hop
oils
cross
my
palate
carbonation
is
sturdy
overall
drinkability
is
of
mixed
emotions
still
abrasively
hoppy
yet
i
remember
there
to
be
so
much
more
finesse
when
i
tried
this
beer
in
the
past
on
tap
and
in
bottles
12
oz
bottle
that
looks
a
lot
thinner
than
i
expected
light
orange
color
and
it
is
quite
cloudy
nice
aroma
candy
and
malts
taste
is
watery
barleywine
bitterness
but
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
this
is
decent
but
its
just
a
tad
thin
for
me
im
always
up
for
trying
a
new
barleywine
a
very
balanced
pleasant
english
bw
i
have
a
personal
hatred
of
beers
that
are
simultaneously
cloyingly
sweet
and
powerfully
bitter
here
the
malt
and
bitterness
and
alcohol
all
blend
together
flawlessly
a
refined
barleywine
drinkability
decent
for
the
style
but
i
found
this
a
bit
too
sweet
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
bit
of
white
head
it
smelled
fairly
tannic
like
orange
hops
molasses
malt
and
alcohol
it
tasted
strongly
of
pine
hops
with
some
floral
hops
and
caramel
malt
mixed
in
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
very
bitter
lasting
aftertaste
with
some
alcohol
warming
overall
this
was
a
very
strong
beer
but
its
flavor
was
onedimensional
it
could
have
used
more
complexity
or
subtlety
oak
barreling
and
a
heavier
body
id
call
this
good
but
not
great
as
barleywines
go
this
one
is
very
drinkable
i
like
the
balance
it
has
now
but
it
would
be
interesting
to
taste
it
with
6
12
months
on
it
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
brown
tints
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
thin
lacing
the
way
a
good
barleywine
does
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
oak
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
oak
and
molasses
with
a
fruity
finish
there
is
also
a
hot
alcohol
presents
up
front
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
which
seems
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
barleywine
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
is
easily
enjoyable
however
there
are
better
barleywines
out
there
pours
quite
a
light
color
for
a
barleywine
a
very
clear
light
amber
copper
color
after
strong
agitation
i
was
able
to
get
a
small
head
but
it
quickly
dissipated
in
the
aroma
the
honey
and
ekgs
are
quite
evident
with
a
floral
sweetness
dominating
quite
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
in
there
as
well
with
some
light
caramel
notes
but
overall
more
like
a
dipa
than
a
bw
as
the
hops
take
control
and
theres
a
lack
of
dark
fruit
theres
a
very
strong
toasted
spiciness
in
the
flavor
with
the
hops
really
standing
forward
almost
a
rye
like
note
as
well
it
finishes
moderately
sweet
with
the
hop
bitterness
really
overtaking
carbonation
is
quite
low
and
the
body
just
seems
a
bit
thin
for
an
english
interpretation
overall
an
enjoyable
barleywine
just
a
few
things
that
need
to
be
tweaked
i
had
this
beer
before
ab
became
involved
and
while
it
was
nothing
out
of
this
world
it
was
nothing
like
this
sickeningly
sweet
with
high
alcohol
making
for
an
almost
undrinkable
beer
yep
sounds
like
it
has
abs
name
all
over
it
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
hot
warming
with
mild
cinnamon
orange
peaking
in
the
swallow
bottled
13108
this
one
is
brewed
with
100
ibus
and
honey
slightly
hazy
honey
amber
with
a
white
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
almost
no
lace
hop
character
in
nose
isnt
what
you
would
expect
from
a
100ibu
beer
but
is
very
pretty
none
the
less
and
much
better
than
what
i
would
expect
from
dominion
floral
and
citrusy
with
a
nice
smokey
and
sweet
malt
backbone
lacks
the
leather
and
earthy
smell
of
a
true
english
barleywine
but
still
very
good
the
honey
really
takes
away
from
the
acidity
nicely
leaving
you
with
a
mellow
hoppy
taste
that
lets
you
enjoy
the
hops
and
smokey
malt
without
being
overridden
by
bitterness
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
body
finish
isnt
incredibly
long
but
lingers
for
sure
dangerously
drinkable
for
an
11
abv
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
from
dominion
and
i
think
ill
have
a
few
more
but
there
is
some
seriusly
tough
competition
out
there
in
this
category
and
if
youre
looking
for
a
super
complex
beer
that
can
stand
up
to
an
old
barolo
this
isnt
the
one
good
intro
into
barleywine
and
great
effort
from
dominion
this
one
is
outstanding
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
its
great
out
of
a
pint
glass
although
usually
a
snifter
is
the
traditional
glass
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
recommended
d
very
good
drinkable
barleywine
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
d
extremely
drinkable
despite
its
honeysweetness
would
be
a
good
choice
for
an
introduction
to
barleywines
nicely
drinkable
now
but
would
age
well
for
a
year
or
two
alchol
is
hidden
nicely
but
does
warm
the
belly
d
somewhat
avererage
barley
wine
but
still
worth
a
try
the
body
is
heavy
and
its
definitely
filling
the
11
4
alcohol
by
volume
is
noticeable
and
warming
this
is
a
nice
sipping
beer
and
i
usually
only
drink
one
at
a
sitting
this
beer
is
definitely
unique
and
worth
a
try
its
strong
and
the
booze
leaks
through
but
not
enough
to
diminish
the
overall
beer
experience
highly
recommended
d
this
beer
threw
me
for
a
loop
after
aging
a
bit
i
honestly
expected
the
hop
character
to
be
less
prevalent
the
carbonation
to
not
be
as
strong
as
it
was
and
for
the
oiliness
to
be
nonexistent
surprising
as
these
were
this
was
quite
drinkable
even
with
the
abv
which
had
mellowed
out
over
time
not
a
mindblowing
barleywine
even
after
a
year
but
still
an
interesting
quaff
if
youve
been
sitting
on
one
of
these
prebuyout
beauties
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
beer
is
kind
of
boring
and
uninteresting
for
a
barley
wine
that
checks
in
at
11
4
abv
but
it
has
some
decent
mellow
flavors
and
is
really
easy
to
drink
my
problem
is
i
can
think
of
quite
a
few
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
much
rather
sip
than
this
one
i
picked
this
up
during
a
recent
visit
to
the
dc
area
from
norms
beer
wine
in
vienna
va
the
bottle
informed
me
that
it
was
packaged
on
4
april
007
and
the
label
told
me
it
would
lay
down
for
several
years
pours
an
orange
ruby
color
similar
to
dark
honey
low
head
retention
has
a
nice
citrusy
aroma
a
faint
odor
of
honey
very
balanced
nice
hoppy
flavor
with
a
heavy
mal
backbone
abv
is
very
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
slightly
sticky
nice
and
smooth
by
far
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barleywines
ive
had
this
bottle
was
only
6
months
old
id
like
to
see
how
a
year
or
two
would
affect
the
flavors
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
as
well
drinkability
is
not
a
strong
point
for
this
beer
either
i
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
year
ago
and
was
much
more
impressed
back
then
this
feels
like
a
step
or
two
in
the
wrong
direction
to
me
but
ill
age
a
couple
and
see
if
that
makes
any
difference
d
defiition
of
a
winter
night
sipper
its
a
cool
night
here
in
north
carolina
so
i
cant
complain
the
honey
is
a
nice
touch
and
i
would
love
to
see
what
this
would
do
over
time
sadly
my
last
one
cheers
the
mouth
is
quite
thick
with
almost
no
carbonation
works
well
a
fine
barleywine
would
be
great
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
but
compares
exceptionally
to
some
of
the
greats
bitter
and
dry
but
they
sneak
up
on
you
dry
in
the
finish
parching
the
back
of
the
throat
fruity
notes
but
not
as
apparent
as
in
the
nose
the
thick
and
sugary
notes
are
also
no
as
apparent
as
in
the
nose
spicy
hop
bitter
notes
with
a
slight
pine
action
to
them
dance
on
the
tongue
not
as
big
and
as
bad
as
the
abv
suggests
abv
actually
is
masked
quite
well
an
ok
barleywine
but
not
one
thats
a
need
to
get
overall
an
awesome
barley
wine
maybe
a
year
is
a
good
aging
point
tho
i
would
like
to
try
older
examples
damn
i
wish
they
distributed
here
this
beer
is
a
real
winner
this
2005
dominion
millenium
is
one
of
the
most
solid
least
flashy
english
barleywines
that
ive
ever
had
ive
tried
not
to
let
my
preference
for
the
hoppy
american
take
on
the
style
get
in
the
way
of
giving
this
one
a
fair
shake
and
i
think
ive
succeeded
these
guys
are
fantastic
brewers
i
hope
the
recent
rumors
of
their
impending
demise
have
been
greatly
exaggerated
very
easy
to
drink
doesnt
shout
at
you
just
slips
down
very
easily
with
no
objectionable
notes
at
all
thanks
to
warriorsoul
for
this
sample
clear
reddish
copper
colour
topped
by
a
solid
cap
of
whitish
foam
that
slowly
subsided
chunky
lacing
with
decent
head
retention
malty
aroma
caramel
with
toffee
notes
and
a
bit
of
grain
husk
floral
hops
and
light
alcohol
as
well
middling
bitterness
with
plenty
of
caramel
sweetness
toffee
toasted
malt
and
molasses
along
with
floral
and
grassy
hops
fill
things
out
alcohol
flavour
and
warmth
grow
into
the
finish
but
arent
overbearing
full
bodied
and
quite
creamy
midlow
carbonation
some
dryness
from
the
alcohol
but
the
malt
keeps
this
in
check
i
like
this
quite
a
lot
definitely
more
english
character
they
sure
didnt
scrimp
on
the
malt
bill
ill
be
looking
for
more
tastes
of
alcohol
up
front
but
not
too
hot
caramel
flavors
hints
of
vanilla
plum
and
other
dark
fruit
some
significant
hops
in
the
finish
but
the
malt
shines
in
this
beer
mouth
is
rich
and
full
finish
is
an
warming
alcohol
burn
a
good
candidate
for
aging
but
pretty
good
now
good
winter
seasonal
cheers
this
delightful
beer
an
exceptional
example
of
its
style
is
a
truly
enjoyable
drink

drinkable
nope
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
a
tasty
beer
mediumfull
body
with
minimal
carbonation
not
as
syrupy
as
i
like
my
barleywines
but
this
is
very
warming
on
a
fairly
cold
evening
very
easy
drinking
and
to
know
that
its
11
4
is
mindblowing
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
and
this
was
brewed
in
april
of
06
not
sure
how
strong
it
was
fresh
but
at
this
point
in
time
its
great
an
incredibly
solid
beer
that
surprised
the
hell
out
of
me
bottling
date
040906
thanks
to
aprilluvsbeer
for
this
via
trade
this
barleywine
is
a
nice
example
done
in
the
style
i
enjoy
i
would
classify
it
as
jw
lees
harvest
light
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
and
deceptively
strong
no
need
to
cellar
for
years
in
the
hopes
it
will
age
right
if
you
are
in
the
area
where
this
is
readily
available
consider
yourself
lucky
if
you
have
a
chance
to
get
one
go
for
it
i
would
like
to
enjoy
this
more
on
a
regular
basis
but
am
unable
to
find
this
brew
in
any
stores
last
swigs
not
even
a
year
old
and
this
seems
to
be
falling
apart
even
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
considering
its
at
11
4
ultimately
this
is
one
very
drinkable
and
easily
likeable
barley
wine
nothing
feels
out
of
balance
and
you
get
everything
you
could
from
this
style
with
this
fine
offering
bottled
21606
so
not
aged
at
all
pours
a
ruddy
dark
amberorange
color
produces
a
12
thick
dense
light
tan
head
which
slowly
fades
to
a
spotty
thin
coating
decent
lacing
as
snifter
drains
aromas
seem
a
bit
tame
for
a
bw
this
big
and
the
alcohol
tends
to
dominate
a
little
too
much
however
pleasant
notes
of
dark
rum
soaked
fruits
caramel
brown
sugar
plum
port
wine
and
a
touch
of
spice
from
the
hops
are
noted
mouthfeel
is
slick
full
and
oily
with
a
very
subtle
carbonation
taste
profile
begins
with
a
big
sweet
malt
blast
lots
of
roasted
malt
raisin
honey
brandy
and
a
touch
of
molasses
this
quickly
slides
into
a
crisp
moderate
spicyfloral
hop
finish
with
a
slight
bitterness
a
restrained
alcohol
presence
in
the
end
but
well
hidden
for
such
a
strong
bw
worth
a
try
but
not
a
classic
excellent
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
it
12oz
bottle
poured
a
light
brownpale
orange
color
with
almost
no
head
picked
up
sugary
malt
molasses
and
some
alcohol
in
aroma
taste
was
all
sweet
at
first
molasses
bread
tawny
port
character
and
then
a
distinct
split
to
bitterness
at
end
these
melded
somewhat
as
the
brew
warmed
but
a
little
too
schizophrenic
for
me
mouthfeel
was
slick
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
drinkability
was
fairly
easy
despite
abv
but
not
really
to
my
taste
d
tasty
like
caramelmalty
beers
youd
like
this
one
not
that
ive
documented
this
fine
beer
i
can
sample
the
oak
aged
version
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
about
a
quarter
inch
of
head
the
head
thins
out
to
just
a
sheet
but
lasts
for
the
duration
and
leaves
heavy
lacing
smells
of
caramel
honey
raisins
plums
and
a
bouquet
of
fresh
flowers
very
interesting
combination
the
flavor
starts
with
the
sweet
syrupy
malt
with
the
floral
hops
following
close
behind
you
get
a
dark
fruit
flavor
mixed
with
the
hops
at
the
end
balanced
really
well
between
the
malts
and
hops
more
of
a
hop
bite
than
what
is
expected
from
an
english
barleywine
but
they
did
a
good
job
with
it
medium
to
thick
body
with
low
carbonation
the
alcohol
burn
you
wait
for
with
a
beer
that
has
an
11
4
abv
never
shows
up
nice
job
old
dominion
maybe
a
bit
hopped
up
for
a
english
style
but
i
came
away
very
impressed
with
this
one
highly
recommend
bottled
on
02112005
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
amber
color
with
a
small
head
carbonation
was
low
but
there
was
a
fine
stream
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
aroma
was
malty
and
caramelly
with
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
nose
taste
was
very
malty
sweet
up
front
with
notes
of
honey
caramel
and
alcohol
a
light
hop
bitterness
was
present
in
the
finish
along
with
a
syrupy
liquourish
flavor
this
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
had
a
strong
flavor
of
alcohol
as
it
warmed
this
detracted
from
the
drinkability
but
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
barleywine
my
remaining
bottle
will
be
cellared
for
another
year
i
hope
to
age
the
one
remaining
bottle
in
my
cellar
another
couple
years
i
wonder
if
the
alcohol
will
settle
even
more
it
stood
a
bit
taller
than
i
would
have
liked
near
the
end
of
the
glass
yearold
sample
hazy
ruby
minimal
carbonation
in
both
appearance
and
mouthfeel
as
many
have
stated
the
nose
is
lovely
hints
of
cherry
plums
sherry
and
vanilla
understated
hoppiness
creamy
and
sweet
throughout
yet
lends
a
subtle
bitterness
that
bodes
well
against
the
massive
malt
complexities
of
caramel
and
oak
wheres
the
booze
im
not
tasting
11
4
whatsoever
itll
probably
catch
up
with
me
later
carbonation
is
low
but
this
is
a
year
old
but
even
then
id
expect
more
nonetheless
what
small
amount
that
is
there
goes
nicely
with
the
sweetness
and
high
alcohol
content
albeit
not
in
the
flavor
does
warm
the
belly
after
a
few
minutes
though
a
sipper
that
is
quite
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
copper
with
hints
of
red
smells
of
caramel
sweet
maltness
white
grape
and
raisiny
sweet
scents
are
also
present
tastes
lightly
of
prunes
and
golden
raisins
very
well
balanced
the
sweetness
comes
across
first
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
small
but
warm
and
pleasing
alcohol
bite
makes
itself
present
in
the
finish
similar
in
many
ways
to
tcoa
in
my
opinion
very
enjoyable
barley
wine
d
extremely
tasty
barleywine
fills
you
up
fast
with
sweetness
and
alcohol
however
preventing
you
from
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
another
great
millennium
the
beer
is
a
nice
reddish
brown
but
the
head
dissipated
quicker
than
i
like
but
strikes
me
as
being
representative
of
english
beers
it
has
a
wonderful
sweet
caramel
nose
the
taste
is
malty
caramel
with
touches
of
honey
and
sherry
it
is
more
subdued
and
not
as
hopped
as
american
versions
of
bw
such
as
snbfbw
the
alcohol
and
sherry
begin
to
dominate
as
the
beer
warms
it
would
be
great
with
or
as
dessert
reddish
orange
color
with
a
small
head
well
aged
melded
malt
aroma
sherry
hints
caramel
and
toffee
with
nice
aroma
hops
but
the
malt
shines
through
in
the
nose
very
sweet
and
sugary
with
honey
laden
malts
sherry
and
a
well
aged
malt
flavor
a
very
nice
barleywine
courtesy
i
think
of
dr
jay
i
bought
this
brew
based
on
a
2oz
taster
and
dont
regret
it
in
the
least
bit
ill
probably
sock
away
at
least
3
for
cellaring
well
done
dominion
i
get
dried
fruit
on
the
nose
notably
raisin
along
with
a
big
whiff
of
alcohol
plus
malt
and
spice
raisins
feature
upfront
on
the
palate
and
later
on
a
hop
finish
creeps
in
there
is
some
alcohol
warmth
but
it
is
quite
mild
the
flavor
profile
is
deep
and
complex
a
solid
beer
from
the
prolific
folks
at
old
dominion
highly
enjoyable
i
figured
id
post
this
as
the
2006
version
is
on
the
shelves
yes
it
does
age
nicely
if
you
treat
it
well
sock
some
away
fun
to
watch
this
one
age
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
tiny
light
brown
head
fruity
aroma
with
some
caramel
and
citric
hops
a
little
earthiness
too
caramel
sweetness
in
the
taste
also
some
fruit
that
worked
well
with
the
brown
sugar
flavors
the
alcohol
is
also
noticable
thin
to
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
this
was
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
but
it
was
enjoyable
huge
fruit
mash
and
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
bread
pudding
almost
apple
cider
color
warm
amber
no
head
soothing
malt
fore
followed
by
pear
sweet
honey
dipped
bread
pear
and
apple
alcohol
is
more
felt
as
a
sensation
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
than
tasted
mouthfeel
is
good
not
quite
as
thick
as
i
would
like
it
a
little
heavier
than
a
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
suffers
due
to
the
lackluster
weak
flavor
and
the
strong
alcohol
presence
this
could
use
some
more
time
to
let
the
subtleties
work
their
way
out
as
the
alcohol
subsides
overall
this
is
good
but
not
outstanding
this
is
a
nice
pleasant
drinking
barley
wine
that
just
isnt
that
complex
yet
having
said
that
it
is
also
very
well
made
and
has
no
real
defects
and
an
excellent
smell
absolutely
this
is
worth
a
try
but
i
think
there
are
other
strong
beers
that
i
like
better
i
will
probably
try
a
wellaged
version
of
this
some
time
in
the
future
drinkability
and
notes
its
certainly
a
sipping
beer
the
sweetness
will
overwhelm
you
if
you
start
taking
large
gulps
the
alcohol
can
also
sneak
up
on
you
even
though
its
noticable
the
fact
that
its
got
11
4
abv
limits
you
will
warm
up
the
insides
though
which
is
essential
in
a
barley
wine
if
you
ask
me
taste
the
hops
hit
at
first
followed
some
by
dark
fruits
and
slightly
sweet
honey
and
toffee
background
and
finishing
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
just
slightly
oilyslick
the
bottled
on
date
was
blank
but
i
believe
i
bought
this
in
04
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
cloudy
orangecopper
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
dies
off
rather
quickly
there
are
bits
of
lacing
here
and
there
the
smell
is
extremely
malty
with
lots
of
biscuit
malt
and
some
dark
fruit
such
as
cherry
and
raisin
theres
a
touch
of
alcohol
as
well
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
sweet
up
front
with
more
of
that
cherry
coming
through
and
a
slight
toastiness
the
finish
is
all
hops
lots
and
lots
of
citrusy
hops
coat
the
tongue
tasty
some
alcohol
is
detected
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
thick
yet
silky
smooth
the
drinkability
lacks
some
due
to
the
sheer
amount
of
alcohol
rather
tasty
but
i
think
it
falls
under
the
american
barleywine
category
more
so
than
the
english
12
oz
bottled
on
21105
brewed
with
honey
and
4
types
of
hops
pours
a
chestnutred
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
recedes
to
nothing
and
leaves
no
lacing
but
the
head
makes
a
comeback
toward
the
end
smells
sweet
with
caramel
malts
a
good
dose
of
hops
and
a
fruitiness
apricots
has
flavors
of
toastybiscuity
and
lots
of
sweet
malts
with
pinecitric
hops
that
have
a
bitterness
that
wavers
back
and
forth
between
weak
and
somewhat
strong
it
is
thick
syrupy
and
warming
with
some
alcohol
noticeable
in
the
flavor
definitely
wouldnt
turn
down
another
one
drinkability
a
nice
sipper
on
a
night
where
it
is
supposed
to
get
down
to
the
single
digits
after
working
outside
all
day
thanks
to
px2grafx
for
a
nice
beer
from
va
clear
like
glass
with
a
reddishorange
autumn
tint
streams
of
haze
ride
the
top
of
the
beer
lacing
is
minimal
and
slippery
at
best
big
sweet
developed
malt
aroma
with
rocket
fuel
notes
and
a
bit
of
something
resembling
seawater
maybe
potato
chips
mild
wood
hints
smoother
drink
than
one
would
imagine
nice
example
of
the
english
style
plummy
with
brown
sugar
candy
explosiveness
big
warmth
and
buzzy
burn
in
the
throat
hops
are
fresher
tasting
and
more
prevalent
than
i
would
have
imagined
perhaps
too
young
at
this
stage
aftertaste
is
rather
fruity
i
can
sense
some
peaches
here
as
well
as
sugar
cookie
and
cherry
vanilla
runs
through
the
brew
faintly
and
ties
it
all
together
not
a
bad
offering
one
i
would
surely
try
again
down
the
road
at
an
elevated
age
bottle
poured
a
reddishorange
color
ale
with
a
small
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
honey
strong
malt
and
bitter
hops
taste
is
sweet
caramel
with
a
full
body
and
a
creamy
texture
lots
of
bitter
hops
can
feel
at
the
end
with
a
warming
feeling
very
good
barleywine
but
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
liking
overall
a
good
barleywine
kind
of
reminds
me
of
victorys
old
horizontal
but
not
quite
as
good
still
however
a
darn
good
beer
that
i
would
go
back
to
if
i
had
the
chance
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
38
beige
head
over
the
orangey
amber
brew
head
is
shortlived
and
quickly
retreats
to
a
small
layer
of
sparse
bubbles
with
average
lacing
both
expected
for
the
style
aroma
is
malt
sweetness
some
hops
and
alcohol
notes
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
the
hops
coming
out
even
more
overshadowing
the
substantial
malts
a
bit
and
then
the
alcohol
warming
dominates
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
great
for
the
style
another
nice
millenium
edition
from
od
definately
a
beer
to
grab
if
you
can
find
it
i
shall
age
one
for
a
while
and
see
what
happens
very
nice
040609
bottle
dated
20108
purchased
from
bon
vivant
in
smithfield
va
brought
a
couple
scores
appearance
and
mouthfeel
down
but
its
still
a
mighty
fine
beer
overall
hazy
orange
amber
in
color
with
a
nose
and
flavor
of
thick
moderately
caramelized
malts
and
lovely
honey
candies
honeyed
biscuits
really
digging
the
nose
as
its
a
touch
unrefined
and
backwoods
and
brings
out
the
best
of
the
aforementioned
characters
sugary
baked
goods
lightly
hopped
good
booze
levels
very
enjoyable
and
id
buy
a
sixer
given
the
change
and
right
price
overall
now
one
of
my
favorite
barley
wines
im
definitely
getting
more
of
these
to
cellar
looks
smells
tastes
and
feels
great
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
enough
barley
wine
but
would
rather
have
other
so
probably
wouldnt
purchase
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
rich
and
complex
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
pale
roasted
and
bisquit
malts
it
has
a
nice
toasted
bread
aroma
very
nice
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
warm
and
toastey
with
a
slightly
dry
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
barleywine
i
like
the
breadlike
toastiness
the
last
few
barleywines
i
had
were
average
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
this
beer
pours
a
clear
orangered
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
nose
is
quite
alcoholic
with
hints
of
honey
and
sweet
malts
upon
tasting
you
know
you
are
in
for
a
treat
there
is
an
overall
warm
alcohol
feel
to
this
beer
lots
of
sweetness
and
toasty
flavors
are
apparent
underneath
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
what
i
would
compare
to
the
mouthfeel
of
a
good
bourbon
or
scotch
strangely
enough
this
is
highly
drinkable
just
beware
the
high
alcohol
wow
very
nice
barley
wines
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
is
pretty
damn
good
the
alcohol
burn
comes
off
more
similar
to
a
fine
scotch
than
a
superhyped
alcohol
beer
the
beer
pours
a
perfect
penny
color
crystal
clear
thin
head
that
vanishes
all
together
aroma
is
full
of
malts
with
some
nce
hops
in
the
background
slight
varnish
aroma
too
taste
is
malty
with
a
very
substantial
hop
presence
lots
of
honey
present
too
which
leaves
the
mouth
with
a
nice
dry
finish
but
not
with
an
overhopped
burn
finish
just
honey
sugar
finish
some
wood
hanging
around
the
edges
too
mouthfeel
is
very
full
hints
of
a
creamy
presence
are
trying
to
break
through
and
i
wonder
if
with
a
bit
of
aging
this
beer
would
change
much
very
agreeable
beer
for
drinking
overall
this
is
a
pretty
basic
barleywine
that
seems
to
have
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
for
its
limited
girth
and
im
not
sure
that
the
use
of
honey
helps
it
in
any
way
in
fact
i
think
it
hurts
it
still
its
a
decent
sipper
very
well
made
and
evenly
balanced
a
very
pleasant
sipper
that
does
an
excellent
job
of
masking
the
high
abv
another
fine
offering
from
old
dominion
really
strong
alcohol
and
juicy
caramel
are
king
here
pretty
damn
good
pours
into
the
snifter
a
gorgeous
translucent
amber
minimal
head
nose
is
rough
alcohol
with
hints
of
hops
and
malt
taste
is
somewhat
sugary
alcohol
quaff
oh
so
very
young
but
this
beer
will
be
dancing
on
this
earth
for
a
long
while
mouthfeel
is
medium
at
best
this
bad
boy
needs
some
time
in
the
cellar
i
have
a
few
waiting
it
is
sippable
now
it
should
be
delicious

2006
bottled
on
feb
11
2005
picked
up
in
virginia
by
pentathlete
and
shipped
to
me
in
what
is
turning
out
to
be
a
great
package
of
beers
this
12
oz
bottle
of
barley
wine
poured
out
with
a
pale
copper
body
that
was
slightly
hazy
the
head
was
very
smallish
and
fleeting
and
the
beer
was
quite
still
in
appearance
the
aroma
was
soft
and
soothing
with
a
mellow
restrained
flowery
hop
tone
riding
atop
sherry
like
alcohol
the
taste
was
quite
a
bit
hot
as
the
beer
had
not
mellowed
at
all
underlying
that
warm
foretaste
was
the
essence
of
cherry
raisin
and
plum
the
hops
were
earthy
and
mildly
bitter
the
body
was
relatively
thin
for
the
style
the
beer
felt
stingingly
warm
at
the
back
of
the
throat
making
this
a
definite
sipper
and
a
slow
one
at
that
i
felt
every
bit
of
its
tender
age
while
drinking
this
beer
i
think
that
the
ratings
would
be
better
after
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
one
day
i
will
find
out
shelf
and
ponder
but
if
you
must
its
still
rather
good
now
this
bottle
was
given
to
me
by
a
friend
to
try
out
its
only
my
second
tasting
of
a
barley
wine
it
poured
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
and
a
lot
of
bubbles
the
head
didnt
last
very
long
it
was
gone
by
the
end
of
my
walk
from
the
kitchen
to
the
computer
room
the
smell
and
taste
is
that
of
hops
layed
in
honey
and
although
its
got
a
higher
alcohol
content
it
doesnt
come
off
as
being
too
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
seems
almost
heavy
although
the
beer
is
light
to
drink
when
held
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
tongue
it
feels
dense
and
weighty
it
has
an
easy
drinkability
and
goes
down
very
smooth
it
also
doesnt
come
off
as
being
as
sticky
as
the
first
barley
wine
i
tried
its
a
nice
change
from
my
normal
belgian
whites
and
if
offered
it
again
i
would
gladly
take
another
or
two
7
99
6pack
ok
i
finally
got
around
to
retasting
this
one
it
was
still
a
very
good
barleywine
nice
floral
and
orange
complex
hop
bite
herbs
mango
leather
well
presented
high
alcohol
medium
body
just
a
masterly
balanced
barleywine
i
think
i
like
it
as
much
as
the
aged
98
ive
had
around
a
year
ago
but
i
dont
doubt
its
capacity
to
support
the
test
of
time
perfumey
woody
and
more
balanced
than
most
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
ruby
hues
and
an
bubbly
white
head
about
a
half
inch
high
aromas
are
a
mix
of
caramels
and
resinous
earthy
piney
hops
along
with
some
sweet
honey
tones
there
is
also
a
fusel
alcohol
present
flavors
are
a
mix
of
toffees
caramels
and
carmelized
sugars
followed
by
a
pleasant
backing
of
sweet
fruits
and
honey
the
body
of
this
brew
has
a
lovely
full
feel
to
it
and
the
carbonation
was
just
slight
enough
to
add
some
depth
the
finish
is
somewhat
hot
from
the
alcohol
and
has
a
nice
bitter
grapefruit
hop
tone
just
at
the
end
that
tries
to
balance
things
out
overall
though
this
brew
was
good
but
just
a
bit
too
cloyingly
sweet
for
me
im
sure
a
couple
years
of
age
could
really
help
things
out
here
simple
and
delicious
though
not
overwhelming
in
anyway
a
good
barley
wine
that
im
glad
to
have
sampled
12
oz
bottle
with
a

appearance
in
the
glass
is
a
dark
amber
color
with
about
a
halfinch
of
beige
head
that
dies
down
quickly
to
a
random
scattering
of
bubbles
left
a
bit
of
lace
as
well
as
it
was
consumed
sweet
malt
and
fruity
notes
dominated
the
aroma
notes
of
molasses
were
present
as
was
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
this
warmed
sweet
tasting
upfront
and
a
bit
of
molasses
and
alcohol
lingering
in
the
background
also
there
were
notes
of
dark
fruits
and
a
slight
alcohol
bite
on
the
aftertaste
it
was
sweet
but
not
cloying
as
the
alcohol
and
hops
kept
that
in
check
almost
full
bodied
this
was
rich
and
coating
in
the
mouth
tasty
stuff
that
i
have
drank
several
of
upon
occasion
and
a
release
i
always
look
forward
each
year
this
is
my
favorite
barleywine
to
date
and
is
by
far
my
favorite
when
talking
of
fresh
barleywines
age
makes
it
better
but
it
is
absolutely
superb
green
too
i
am
sampling
a
chilled
bottle
in
a
snifter
beer
pours
a
clear
chestnut
color
with
a
very
small
off
white
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
clover
honey
caramel
toffee
and
some
piney
hops
first
sip
reveals
a
small
prickly
carbonation
and
a
big
syrupy
texture
the
flavor
is
toffee
pears
and
plums
and
some
piney
hops
there
is
a
significant
alcohol
bite
but
at
11
4
this
is
expected
the
alcohol
is
not
dominant
by
any
means
but
is
present
for
sure
this
is
a
big
tasty
beer
not
for
the
faint
hearted
gives
a
nice
warming
in
my
belly
but
no
burn
on
the
way
down
very
well
crafted
there
is
actually
quite
a
bit
of
hop
contribution
here
as
well
it
was
just
hard
to
pick
out
because
of
the
dominating
maltiness
the
hops
are
herbal
grassy
and
piney
up
front
the
finish
is
moderately
bitter
with
a
hint
of
astringency
overall
this
is
quite
enjoyable
certainly
it
is
quite
flavorful
and
rich
though
the
hop
flavor
could
be
a
bit
more
dynamic
thanks
to
pintofale
for
the
opportunity
on
this
one
thanks
to
aleoha
for
the

appreciated

not
cloudy
but
not
a
see
through
amber
either
looks
like
it
would
come
across
with
a
full
mouthfeel
and
it
delivers
aroma
is
of
alcohol
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
alleviate
any
worries
this
is
about
the
fastest
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
but
if
you
let
it
warm
up
it
spreads
itself
out
and
stays
awhile
very
nice
smooth
as
silk
and
mostly
all
malt
yeah
theres
some
hops
floating
around
but
this
one
is
about
the
malt
i
do
appreciate
getting
a
full
description
about
the
beer
from
the
bottle
i
would
call
this
beer
dangerous
but
damn
good
due
to
the
malt
remarkably
easy
to
drink
but
the
alcohol
is
there
in
every
sip
to
slow
you
down
very
good
this
one
is
a
dark
redchestnut
colour
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dies
quickly
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
nice
malts
in
there
and
a
bit
of
booze
there
is
also
a
nice
hoppiness
in
the
aroma
is
well
the
hoppiness
leans
towards
the
herbal
side
of
things
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
the
sweet
malts
up
front
the
middle
is
quite
boozy
and
the
finish
is
very
grassy
and
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
thick
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
barleywine
a
gorgeous
deep
orange
color
almost
fades

lingering

nice
big

fairly

considering

on
the
palate
a
huge
barleywine
that
would
seriously
benefit
from

big
at
present
to
enjoy
more
then

in
a
session
for
this
kidseek
and
enjoy
thanks
to
manekineko
for
the
bottles
thanks
to
avylover
for
the
bottle
since
i
was
sold
out
at
the
time
ill
start
by
saying
that
i
like
this
i
enjoy
malt
and
this
offers
plenty
but
i
think
im
conditioned
by
the
current
trend
in
this
style
to
expect
truly
rocking
hop
profiles
and
that
doesnt
happen
here
still
standing
alone
there
are
enough
hops
to
nudge
you
in
the
side
the
abv
lurks
somewhat
but
it
certainly
comes
clean
when
it
warms
your
belly
and
fogs
your
head
caution
is
a
prudent
concept
but
id
gladly
have
anouther
though
not
one
for
the
road
so
it
may
not
stand
atop
some
lofty
pinnacle
but
id
not
hesitate
a
whit
to
recommend
that
anyone
i
know
and
respect
give
this
one
a
try
looks
bright
orange
with
a
head
thats
thin
and
white
smells
malty
but
doesnt
have
the
fruitiness
of
other
high
gravity
brews
i
take
a
sip
and
swish
it
in
my
mouth
and
taste
some
sweet
malt
and
good
hoppiness
along
with
the
taste
of
a
shot
of
vodka
and
the
warming
alcohol
aroma
going
through
my
lungs
this
stuff
tastes
like
they
added
a
big
shot
of
vodka
to
every
bottle
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
another
one
this
one
would
be
a
good
candidate
to
cellar
for
a
year
or
two
to
see
if
it
mellows
out
overall
i
honestly
didnt
enjoy
drinking
this
much
it
pours
a
hazy
orangeamberbrown
with
just
a
thin
wisp
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
some
muted
herbal
and
minty
hops
and
some
caramel
it
has
some
caramel
sweetness
and
is
yeasty
there
is
a
juicy
herbal
mint
hoopiness
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
with
a
lingering
sweetness
there
isnt
much
depth
to
this
beer
it
is
just
bitter
and
sweet
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
john
drinkability
rock
solid
and
beyond
barleywine
bargain
priced
to
boot
cant
wait
to
see
what
time
does
to
this
this
brew
pours
a
little
lightr
than
your
average
barleywine
with
more
of
a
hazy
reddish
orange
color
going
on
and
e
creamy
head
aroma
of
apples
bready
malt
pears
alcohol
and
all
around
yumminess
the
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
here
starts
off
with
a
fruity
blast
much
like
some
of
your
belgian
ales
then
a
heavy
bready
maltiness
kicks
in
along
with
a
citrous
hop
flavor
lots
of
flavor
going
on
here
one
minor
complaint
is
the
heavy
alcohol
taste
which
is
not
masked
or
blended
well
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
chewy
with
just
enough
carbonation
its
a
bit
sticky
in
the
finish
though
drinkability
is
par
for
a
barleywine

going
to
keep
the
rest
around
for
awhile
drink
one
every
few
months
and
see
how
it
matures
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
this
brew
pours
a
rusty
orange
color
the
head
was
short
lived
and
a
thin
ring
was
around
my
glass
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
and
sweet
candy
alcohol
was
also
present
the
taste
was
rich
with
flavors
caramel
candy
malt
and
hops
and
alcohol
are
on
the
list
of
things
to
notice
while
enjoying
this
brew
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
brew
from
odb
it
is
the
first
brew
that
i
have
tried
from
them
and
it
will
not
be
the
last
this
barley
wine
is
well
worth
the
search
do
yourself
a
favor
and
seek
out
this
beer
and
the
others
from
the
brewer
you
wont
regret
it
i
poured
this
beer
by
mistake
i
thought
i
was
having
a
different
dominion
beer
and
had
meant
to
age
this
one
a
little
further
no
need
tomorrow
im
going
to
buy
a
bunch
more
pronto
im
sorry
the
2002
vintage
didnt
come
across
like
this
one
but
it
didnt
overall
an
awesome
barleywine
that
is
both
very
british
and
very
american
at
the
same
time
props
to
that
12oz
bottle
1999
vimtage
poured
thick
and
a
cloudy
amber
color
looking
like
apple
cider
no
head
to
speak
of
aroma
is
a
strong
sweet
malty
one
with
a
classic
barley
wine
profile
also
contains
notes
of
oak
and
vanilla
body
is
velvety
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
malt
slight
fruitiness
and
finishes
with
a
warming
alcohol
kick
overall
this
has
aged
very
well
i
took
my
first
sip
around
48
degrees
very
very
smooth
nice
blend
of
honey
and
malt
big
burn
finish
which
i
was
disappointed
with
became
more
balanced
with
temperature
and
much
more
drinable
however
i
couldnt
get
past
the
alcohol
burn
backend
i
really
like
barleywines
and
this
is
a
good
one
for
sure
perhaps
some
more
age
will
mellow
it
out
a
bit
more
this
was
the
first
barley
wine
that
ive
had
while
it
was
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
then
one
at
a
sitting
next
time
im
out
i
think
ill
pick
up
a
couple
more
of
these
to
hang
onto
for
a
couple
years
browndark
amber
body
with
next
to
no
head
but
when
you
rouse
it
it
will
come
just
a
bit
of
sediment
scents
of
malt
and
sharp
hops
apple
blossoms
notable
honey
and
sugar
toffee
and
cocoa
have
a
alot
to
do
here
hints
of
clove
and
chestnuts
the
flavor
is
nice
bitter
and
somewhat
smokey
with
earth
and
honey
nutty
herbal
and
woody
notes
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
clove
and
sage
the
mouthfeel
was
sticky
and
not
very
bubbly
nor
active
my
opinion
about
its
drinkability
is
that
its
alright
but
not
an
everyday
beer
not
very
sessionable
this
is
my
first
barleywine
review
and
i
havent
much
experience
with
them
this
one
was
nice
and
the
bigfoot
on
tap
was
alright
but
i
may
have
to
update
this
further
down
the
line
thanks
for
reading
my
review
i
tried
full
bodied
with
gentle
carbonation
an
excellent
barley
wine
that
stood
up
well
to
6
years
in
the
bottle
a
big
thanks
to
floydicus
for
sharing
the
bottle
with
me
cheers
as
my
three
year
old
daughter
would
say
yummy
pours
a
lovely
cloudy
copper
hue
under
a
thin
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
to
form
a
film
across
the
top
and
a
healthy
collar
not
much
lace
but
more
than
i
expected
for
such
a
high
abv
this
brew
has
a
marvelously
deep
malty
nose
with
a
touch
of
honey
the
mouth
is
prickly
and
heavy
with
a
savory
sweetness
that
makes
you
just
want
to
hold
it
forever
the
malt
and
honey
come
out
clearly
in
the
initial
taste
deep
and
penetrating
with
caramel
and
toffee
tones
then
the
hops
kick
in
bold
and
beautiful
alcohol
is
definitely
here
the
impression
and
aftertaste
are
a
bit
whiskeyesque
this
brew
is
a
delight
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
cheers

me
the

is
topped
by

the
aroma
is
a
blend
of

caramel
sweetness
and
spicy
hops
on
the
tongue
the
malt
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
a
smooth
sweetness
nice
caramel
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
very
fruity

with
a

is
unbelievably
mellow
and
is
easily
the
most
drinkable
balanced
barleywine
ive
had
in
a
while
malt
driven
yet
superbly
balanced
if
the
bottled
version
is
nearly
as
good
get
some
wonderful
acquired
in
the
philadelphia
gathering
beer
exchange
the
beer
poured
out
a
bright
copper
orange
color
and
had
a
thin
white
head
heavy
fruit
aroma
and
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
raisins
figs
apples
caramel
along
with
a
toasted
nutiness
taste
is
strong
but
not
overbearing
close
to
being
a
sipper
but
not
there
yet
still
very
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
lingering
oiliness
on
the
back
of
the
throat
its
complex
and
strong
i
like
this
beer
very
much
all
and
all
i
liked
it
and
will
try
to
get
a
bottle
to
age
a
few
years
clearly
one
cannot
drink
this
all
night
but
youd
want
to
if
you
could
big
shout
out
to
my
man
murph
and
the
bif
so
why
didnt
it
feel
like
11

thanks
to
marc77
for
sending
it
along
but
a
nice
beer
thanks
a
million
for
the
millenium
davo
this
is
a
very
good
barley
winestyle
ale
its
color
is
a
nice
amber
color
with
some
cloudiness
to
it
it
has
a
little
bit
of
head
to
it
but
it
died
down
after
a
while
the
smell
was
quite
strong
of
some
fruits
maybe
some
grapes
and
some
citrus
fruits
but
also
had
a
barley
smell
as
well
it
starts
out
pretty
sharp
but
ends
out
smooth
even
though
it
has
over
11
of
alcohol
in
it
you
cant
really
taste
it
which
is
probably
a
hard
thing
to
do
all
in
all
its
a
very
nice
brew
and
i
will
be
back
for
more
i
am
very
suprised
with
whats
here
in
va
this
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
so
when
i
received
a
bottle
from
murph
i
was
very
excited
something
that
we
cant
get
in
new
england
but
one
that
i
have
wanted
to
try
pours
are
beautiful
amber
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
is
sweet
sherry
and
a
hint
of
hops
when
i
tasted
this
brew
the
first
thing
that
i
noticed
was
how
smooth
it
was
i
had
to
look
at
the
date
again
just
to
make
sure
it
was
from
the
2002
batch
hints
of
raisins
figs
and
something
very
earthy
comes
through
i
can
definately
feel
the
warming
feeling
coming
through
i
might
be
chastised
for
saying
this
but
i
would
put
it
against
bigfoot
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
a
inviting
sweet
honey
aroma
leapt
out
it
poured
with
little
head
or
carbonation
a
orange
bronze
color
with
more
sediment
than
most
barley
wines
ive
seen
maybe
the
dry
hops
flavor
starts
with
a
nice
honey
taste
then
balances
out
quickly
very
impressive
for
11
4
as
strong
as
this
is
i
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
the
date
was
smudged
but
the
back
said
11
4
so
i
think
its
2002
to
cellar
this
would
be
interesting
but
its
very
drinkable
right
now
thanks
for
the
sample
murph
wow
an
impressive
offering
to
be
sure
hazy
copper
with
a
billowy
creamy
head
that
eventually
reduces
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
across
the
surface
the
smell
is
outstanding
with
caramel
freshbaked
brown
bread
and
a
dose
of
honey
announcing
the
rich
use
of
malts
and
honey
with
some
floral
hoppiness
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
taste
is
initially
sweet
though
beautifully
offset
by
the
generous
but
not
overdone
use
three
american
hop
varieties
in
the
boil
lest
ye
think
this
be
an
allamerican
beer
they
dry
hop
with
english
kentgoldings
giving
the
beer
a
refined
almost
english
quality
immensely
enjoyable
what
a
terrific
way
to
toast
the
change
of
seasons
283
this
would
be
a
interesting
to
cellar
for
a
couple
of
years
this
was

noticible
taste
reveals

afterwords
followed
by

the
label
states
that
honey
is
used
in

but
im
hard
pressed
to
taste
it
finishes
long

bitter

this

hopefully
my

age

will
tell
this

to
have
some

now
and
some

is
no

a

well
done
aged

just
enough
sweetness
balanced
with

bitterness
mild
oak
flavor
lingers
serving
type
bottle
smooth
been
awhile
since
ive
had
a
barleywine
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
its
not
overpowering
in
any
way
just
crisp
smooth
and
satisfying
i
doesnt
rock
my
world
but
im
sure
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
o
like
i
said
this
is
a
sixyearold
bottle
and
man
is
it
smooth
and
oaky
and
fruity
and
malty
i
like
this
a
lot
more
than
i
did
when
i
tried
the
fresher
version
oak
aged
widdershins
isnt
bad
at
all
but
doesnt
quite
come
together
im
surprised
by
how
harsh
the
alcohol
seems
given
that
i
drink
stronger
brews
on
a
regular
basis
perhaps
some
age
would
do
this
good
but
i
didnt
detect
enough
of
what
i
look
for
in
either
american
or
english
barleywines
to
spend
any
more
money
here
mouthfeel
is
thick
a
little
sticky
not
unpleasant
this
is
pretty
good
this
beer
starts
in
england
and
ends
with
an
american
finish
in
the
nose
peat
overwhelms
the
senses
with
dried
fruits
and
burnt
sugar
lingering
behind
the
palate
is
similar
with
flavors
akin
to
that
of
an
english
barley
wine
only
with
overtones
of
peat
it
finishes
abruptly
with
a
sharp
drying
bitterness
overall
this
beer
has
allot
of
bold
flavors
but
just
doesnt
seem
to
harmonize
maybe
some
age
would
help
o
theres
just
not
a
lot
to
the
beer
on
any
level
except
for
the
high
alcohol
content
this
would
be
a
decent
beer
for
drinking
with
a
heavy
mealan
easy
drinking
barleywine
if
you
will
overall
not
really
into
this
style
of
beer
but
this
was
good
that
little
but
of
cinnamon
in
the
taste
profile
made
a
huge
difference
o
i
really
like
this
barleywinenot
too
sweet
or
cloying
with
a
light
bitterness
at
the
end
to
round
things
off
this
was
a
2013
bottle
22
oz
and
i
have
two
more
in
the
cellar
ill
look
forward
to
trying
another
in
about
a
year
i
think
the
2007
is
over
the
hill
but
i
do
think
the
2013
could
well
improve
well
with
a
few
years
on
it
it
drinks
quite
well
right
now
an
unexpectedly
enjoyable
barleywine
review
rating
is
for
the
fresh
widdershins
the
aged
one
would
grade
about
a
half
point
lower
on
taste
because
of
the
thin
finish
and
effects
of
oxidation
the
appearance
gets
a
few
decimals
extra
because
the
aged
one
has
such
a
creamy
good
looking
head
o
while
this
isnt
horrible
the
proportion
of
peated
malt
is
much
too
high
and
obscures
the
other
elements
of
the
beer
pours
a
moderate
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
the
nose
carries
oak
oak
and
more
oak
as
it
warms
i
get
a
bit
more
oak
other
than
that
a
touch
of
semisweet
malt
its
not
terrible
just
horribly
onedimensional
other
than
the
oak
there
was
a
touch
of
caramel
and
sweetness
id
rather
not
have
this
again
the
nose
is
heavy
citrus
up
front
grapefruit
orange
lots
of
sugar
and
malt
too
a
little
woody
with
bourbon
notes
tying
together
with
the
malt
sweetness
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
the
flavor
is
a
little
spice
citrus
hops
bourbon
and
vanilla
honey
and
caramel
very
sticky
and
a
bit
all
over
the
place
this
may
get
better
with
age
but
right
now
a
bit
too
boozy
for
the
flavors
overall
a
very
nice
offering
not
as
complex
as
some
similar
brews
but
still
a
beer
that
i
would
revisit
the
bitter
finish
could
probably
withstand
a
year
or
two
of
aging
but
it
would
be
a
loss
to
age
too
long
and
lose
that
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
great
for
an
aged
barleywine
thats
been
thru
some
tough
cellaring
body
is
thick
but
not
too
thick
no
cloying
overall
pretty
good
beer
but
i
dont
see
it
going
anywhere
with
more
time
in
the
cellar
d
alright
really
dry
and
watery
yet
boozy
body
o
a
decent
beer
well
rounded
and
balanced
while
offering
a
range
of
flavors
and
warming
the
tongue
however
something
is
off
with
this
beer
the
hops
are
all
gone
and
the
characteristic
barleywine
heat
is
missing
as
for
the
oak
aging
im
getting
some
wood
out
of
it
but
not
that
telltale
vanillaoakiness
3
5
i
was
getting
ready
to
knock
this
beer
for
a
lot
of
flaws
when
i
was
sampling
it
fresh
out
of
the
fridge
but
i
have
to
say
warming
it
up
has
really
let
a
rather
good
beer
come
out
the
oak
impact
is
minimal
and
i
believe
it
is
mellowing
the
hops
a
bit
and
possibly
fusing
the
flavors
together
a
bit
while
adding
some
tannins
and
a
light
but
of
nuttyearthy
over
tones
in
the
back
ground
or
im
just
crazy
and
read
that
in
another
review
and
stole
it
im
honestly
not
sure
as
this
beer
has
me
somewhat
perplexed
i
saw
some
arrogant
bastard
like
comments
and
i
have
to
say
i
get
that
this
beer
getting
near
or
past
2
years
i
just
have
a
2009
year
on
here
no
month
that
i
see
the
hops
most
likely
have
faded
from
sight
so
this
isnt
bastard
but
the
malt
profile
and
the
presence
of
the
hops
certainly
does
remind
me
of
it
in
ways
though
certainly
different
experiences
to
drink
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
finger
if
off
white
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
and
decent
head
retention
the
aroma
is
amazing
big
bits
of
matly
caramel
and
some
earthy
hops
are
apparent
the
taste
is
slighty
off
however
it
starts
with
some
roasted
malt
and
strong
caramel
and
then
hits
you
strong
with
cardboard
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
and
slightly
carbonated
and
finishes
smooth
overall
worth
a
try
and
it
has
a
tom
of
potential
sure
for
an
almost
fouryearold
oakaged
barleywine
this
aint
what
should
be
really
where
is
the
oak
but
it
is
still
good
and
enjoyable
d
nothing
awesome
about
this
beer
but
certainly
dont
turn
it
down
if
offered
it
poured
a
cloudy
orangeamber
which
can
be
expected
if
it
had
been
shaken
due
to
bottle
conditioning
but
it
had
not
the
head
was
very
slight
and
did
not
hang
around
long
enough
to
make
the
walk
from
the
kitchen
to
the
living
room
there
were
some
hints
of
malt
in
the
aroma
but
they
were
overpowered
by
the
smell
of
soured
washcloth
dirt
not
to
be
confused
with
earthiness
and
mildew
all
of
the
smells
came
through
in
the
taste
but
the
malt
gained
a
little
bit
of
an
edge
and
competed
with
the
sourness
little
if
any
of
the
oak
came
through
in
the
flavor
but
there
was
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
not
what
one
would
expect
even
from
a
year
old
barleywine
the
mouthfeel
was
and
astringent
and
had
a
slight
burn
from
the
alcohol
which
was
not
pleasant
with
the
thin
body
in
my
years
of
drinking
i
have
only
drainpoured
two
beers
and
had
i
had
more
than
a
4
oz
sample
this
would
have
been
a
third
i
might
be
willing
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
if
someone
else
pays
d
cant
drink
this
it
tastes
horrible
another
crappy
beer
from
left
hand
not
a
surprise
to
me
avoid
this
mess
md
feel
is
above
medium
with
some
rough
patches
and
heat
kinda
chewy
and
coating
on
the
mouth
its
drinkable
but
i
struggled
through
my
glass
would
not
be
my
1st
choice
for
a
barley
wine
truthfully
i
think
the
hop
bill
is
kinda
skewed
here
they
just
dont
mesh
right
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
amber
with
a
perfect
light
tan
colored
whipped
cream
head
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
have
ever
seen
i
was
amazed
at
the
clarity
of
the
beer
considering
its
bottle
conditioned
smell
is
some
raw
brown
sugar
and
charred
wood
taste
is
a
hint
of
ripe
bananas
up
front
with
a
creamy
toffee
middle
and
a
dry
woody
finish
the
oak
aging
is
nice
often
times
it
is
overdone
there
is
also
a
hint
of
flowery
hops
in
the
finish
just
enough
to
balance
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
nice
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
i
would
certainly
get
this
again
the
alcohol
is
nearly
imperceptible
which
is
difficult
to
do
in
beers
of
this
gravity
d
this
was
split
four
ways
and
the
small
amount
we
each
had
to
drink
was
hard
each
person
had
trouble
finishing
this
with
two
of
the
people
sending
it
down
the
drain
enough
said
d
when
a
beer
becomes
a
chore
to
drink
it
isnt
all
that
good
not
very
good
drinkability
at
all
in
fact
its
not
much
of
a
barleywine
honestly
and
its
not
much
of
a
barrel
aged
beer
overall
by
far
the
clunker
of
the
tasting
im
not
sure
if
this
one
was
off
or
what
i
actually
had
to
drain
pour
my
last
few
sips
simply
nothing
i
would
ever
seek
out
again
d
very
malty
and
sugary
sweet
even
for
the
style
has
an
obvious
boozy
warmth
even
for
it
being
this
old
not
bad
just
a
little
too
sugary
sweet
and
malty
for
my
tastes
not
much
balance
not
bad
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
obviously
lush
and
aged
this
still
packs
some
real
kick
maybe
the
aggressive
bottle
conditioning
and
hopping
helped
preserve
this
much
better
than
i
would
have
thought
this
must
have
been
a
real
beast
fresh
seriously
i
think
this
could
easily
go
another
35
years
i
think
i
opened
this
too
early
22
oz
bomber
2009
batch
pours
a
nice
hazy
amber
color
with
maybe
a
finger
of
ecru
head
seems
to
me
that
this
one
would
fall
into
the
english
style
barley
wine
category
with
aromas
of
caramel
chocolate
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
citrusy
hops
i
didnt
get
a
whole
lot
of
oak
out
of
this
one
which
was
a
little
disappointing
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
and
caramel
dominate
on
the
palate
ok
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
d
i
have
a
half
growler
of
this
and
will
definitely
polish
it
off
pretty
impressive

this

a
try
its
a

different
than
your
typlical
american
barleywine
but
still
has
plenty
of
interesting
flavors
to
go
around
this
is
my
first
brandy
barrel
aged
beer
and
i
must
say
its
a
nice
departure
from
the
whiskey
barrel
aged
beers
i
typically
encounter
the
oak
character
is
smoother
and
more
delicate
not
the
onslaught
of
raw
oakiness
and
booze
that
whiskey
cask
aged
beers
can
be
taste
i
really
thought
i
was
gonna
love
this
but
its
not
up
to
expectations
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
love
barleywine
and
oakaged
i
expected
to
be
better
brownish

cloudy

hues
a
little
over
one
finger
of
tan
head
results
from
an
explosion
of
carbonation
sticks
around
and
then
quickly
disappears
a
few
small
fingers
and
sheets
of
lace
are
left
behind
smells
a
bit
chocolaty
up
front
with
some
earthiness
in
the
middle
and
some
sweet
cherries
lingering
toward
the
end
tastes
initially
sweet
and
malty
with
a
good
hoppy
backbone
and
an
oakiness
around
the
edges
some
light
and
dark
fruits
wind
there
way
through
from
time
to
time
a
hint
of
booziness
is
noted
but
not
much
to
speak
of
brew
goes
down
medium
with
an
airiness
to
it
pretty
complex
brew
that
could
use
a
little
bolder
approach
in
some
areas
but
nothing
to
bitch
about
easy
to
drink
without
a
doubt
and
the
general
presentation
is
fairly
nice
on
the
whole
though
my
thoughts
are
that
this
one
is
all
over
the
map
and
just
a
little
over
the
top
in
that
direction
to
have
it
be
a
good
thing
dont
get
me
wrong
im
not
into
onetrick
ponies
either
but
this
finished
product
combines
so
many
different
melodies
that
it
just
cant
quite
carry
a
tune
d
certainly
a
sipper
but
an
easy
drinker
im
happy
to
have
it
on
hand
as
the
ohio
winter
grows
increasingly
cold
refreshing
lighter
offering
that
didnt
disappoint
id
have
it
again
this
was
a
treatmy
first
from
left
hand
pours
a
nice
caramel
color
with
about
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
laces
nicely
as
the
brew
goes
along
smell
is
a
bit
lacking
boozy
with
some
caramel
and
sweetness
taste
however
is
great
big
oaky
notes
coupled
with
some
grassy
hops
sweet
caramel
and
a
bit
of
booze
but
it
works
in
this
case
nice
piney
burps
following
gotta
love
that
mf
is
a
bit
lacking
in
the
creamy
department
full
bodied
and
oily
but
i
would
like
some
more
creaminess
i
moved
through
the
bomber
pretty
quick
definitely
a
nice
enjoyable
oa
barleywine
definitely
will
revisit
this
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
that
lives
just
behind
the
oak
aged
bastard
in
terms
of
quality
i
was
expecting
a
ton
of
sweetness
with
this
for
some
reason
im
not
sure
if
i
noticed
that
its
listed
as
an
american
barleywine
but
i
was
expecting
much
more
in
line
with
english
the
aroma
hints
at
this
as
well
a
lot
of
malt
much
more
than
anything
with
raisin
and
a
figlike
character
that
was
reminiscient
of
doppelbocks
the
pour
is
very
nice
a
somewhatcloudy
redorange
the
red
was
surprisingly
nice
the
flavor
is
much
more
bitter
than
expected
not
that
theres
a
tno
of
hop
but
its
definitely
not
just
all
malt
the
wood
character
is
also
quitepresent
and
even
imparts
sort
of
a
dry
feeling
to
the
mouth
which
is
otherwise
moderatelybodied
overall
its
certainly
decent
not
the
most
incredible
and
i
almost
wish
the
flavor
would
tilt
a
little
more
in
either
direction
either
more
hop
or
more
malt
the
balance
between
the
two
allows
the
oak
to
take
over
a
little
too
much
drinkability
a
really
easy
drinking
barleywine
as
well
as
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
not
your
tradtional
barleywine
md
medium
to
full
body
carbonation
is
slightly
prickly
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
fair
overall
a
solid
beer
but
i
could
really
use
some
more
malt
character
drinkability
is
good
its
on
the
milder
end
of
the
spectrum
as
far
as
hops
and
bitterness
go
its
not
an
all
out
assault
on
your
palate
but
theres
just
enough
of
all
the
good
stuff
to
make
this
quite
enjoyable
id
buy
this
again
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
more
thick
and
creamy
mild
carbonation
very
good
beer
the
taste
is
pretty
good
sweet
a
bit
of
citrus
and
a
lot
of
citrus
bitterness
prolly
a
decent
i2pa
actually
okish
at
this
point
as
an
american
bwine
but
but
the
color
and
smell
are
just
so
wrong
drinkability
is
moderate
ill
finish
the
750
but
not
quickly
good
i
guess
what
with
the
10
abv
courtesy
of
gillard
2007
vintage
poured
hazy
copper
with
gold
edges
and
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
peach
and
tangelo
followed
by
some
chewy
malt
sweetness
wood
notes
and
just
a
bit
of
booze
the
taste
has
bold
notes
of
oak
but
not
too
much
next
to
the
wood
are
chewy
sticky
malts
solid
pine
hop
flavor
and
pine
hop
bitterness
yum
the
varied
notes
are
well
matched
creating
a
pleasing
experience
this
should
only
get
better
with
age
d
tasty
but
a
bit
to
cloying
to
drink
a
lot
of
worth
trying
and
sharing
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
d
this
is
a
good
tasting
barleywine
but
is
a
bit
much
to
handle
in
terms
of
drinkability
drinkability
is
good
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
and
strong
taste
drinkability
is
low
way
to
oaky
and
astringent
it
makes
it
seem
like
its
about
4
stronger
im
not
really
sure
though
why
the
oak
aged
version
would
actually
be
weaker
then
the
orginal
this
was
a
real
struggle
to
work
through
and
generally
unpleasant
warming
up
made
no
difference
i
wasnt
really
concerned
with
drinking
beer
tonight
so
i
patiently
powered
through
the
first
12
for
a
few
hours
i
got
used
to
it
sort
of
but
it
just
wasnt
worth
the
pain
and
i
dumped
the
rest
one
of
the
worst
made
brews
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
dont
think
ive
liked
any
of
the
beers
ive
had
from
left
hand
found
several
bottles
of
the
2004
vintage
stocked
in
albuquerque
nm
for
3
99
each
this
happened
on
121808
so
that
1
per
year
what
a
deal
out
of
the
caged
bottle
this
beer
was
a
very
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
retained
as
a
skim
and
laced
quite
well
the
aroma
was
incredibly
pungent
and
notably
sweet
lots
of
ripe
peaches
pears
and
figs
alcohol
esters
and
heat
hints
of
wood
and
lots
of
caramel
malt
the
flavors
were
smooth
complex
and
well
rounded
it
started
with
a
biscuity
malt
flavor
before
becoming
more
rich
and
sweet
caramel
malt
ripened
fruit
hints
of
spices
a
slight
citrus
tanginess
and
a
warming
alcohol
pleasantness
towards
the
end
the
sugars
had
been
well
tempered
by
the
wood
and
age
the
carbonation
was
very
soft
partly
the
age
again
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
mouthfeel
smooth
but
a
little
watery
the
years
had
truly
done
this
one
well
it
was
balanced
smooth
quaffable
and
rewarding
with
the
punchy
alcohol
well
blended
in
bravo
a
drinkable
and
very
average
barley
wine
aroma
was
so
so
hints
of
vanilla
oak
and
sweet
malt
pour
was
a
nice
deep
murky
brown
with
a
thin
tan
ring
for
a
head
taste
was
subdued
for
a
barley
wine
sweet
hot
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
oak
and
a
moderate
alcohol
burn
decent
carbonation
as
it
warmed
a
little
caramel
and
toffee
came
out
with
the
alcohol
dominating
average
at
best
d
golden
warmth
smooth
sipping
mellow
and
sublime
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
an
aged
barleywine
can
be
d
very
for
the
style
the
drink
is
medium
in
body
and
light
on
the
carbonation
light
on
oak
light
on
flavor
and
light
on
my
drinkability
scale
pretty
disappointing
skip
it
d
i
expected
this
to
be
a
chore
to
drink
but
was
rewarded
with
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
barleywine
thats
big
on
flavor
the
alcohol
flavor
while
noticable
was
relatively
well
contained
oh
its
good
but
not
unique
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
huge
stiff
light
yellow
head
that
resists
fading
a
reasonable
amount
of
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
has
a
really
nice
complexity
to
it
initially
i
got
an
earthiness
that
i
wanted
to
equate
to
smoky
but
as
it
warms
up
there
is
a
unique
fragrant
fruity
apricot
nature
visibly
effervescent
the
mouth
feel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
very
dry
finish
full
flavored
the
sweet
malty
caramel
character
is
secondary
to
the
piny
resin
hoppiness
which
lingers
on
with
an
earthy
smoky
texture
an
interesting
drink
with
a
lot
to
consider
recommended
taste
was
similar
floral
and
malty
with
a
spiciness
i
probably
could
have
stuck
with
these
all
night
but
they
would
have
been
peeling
me
off
the
bathroom
floor
very
intriguing
and
unique
brew
hope
to
find
it
again

surprise

find

tap
poured
into
a
10
tumbler
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
an
extremely
fluffy
white
head
very
aromatic
for
a
barleywine
i
get
some
smoke
flavor
oak
and
alcohol
tastes
as
it
smells
you
get
a
lot
of
the
oaky
flavor
very
sweet
malt
presence
slick
mouthfeel
you
have
to
watch
out
drinkin
these
bombs
when
colder
the
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
however
when
the
beer
warmed
up
the
complexity
could
be
truly
experienced
both
have
advantages
i
loved
the
way
the
colder
beer
felt
i
could
drink
it
cold
all
night
and
it
was
great
for
a
hot
day
the
warmer
beer
tasted
much
more
complex
and
interesting
but
i
could
not
drink
much
more
than
a
glass
this
way
these
barleywine
blends
are
interesting
because
you
get
the
sharp
hops
that
develop
up
front
along
with
the
duller
hops
that
have
been
around
for
a
while
this
isnt
a
vanilla
bomb
since
its
a
blend
some
of
the
more
complex
notes
you
find
in
an
aged
beer
are
in
there
as
well
its
a
pretty
solid
and
interesting
beer

conditioned
i
had
a
tough
time
getting
the
cork
out
for
some
reason
poured
a
hazy
reddish
gold
with
a
couple
of
fingers
of
white
bubbled
head
pretty
good
amount
of
carbonation
great
aroma
lots
of
fresh
pineycitrusy
hops
also
some
burnt
sugar
i
didnt
get
much
oak
from
this
there
was
a
pronounced
smokey
note
medium
bodied
with
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
long
hoppy
finish
with
a
little
pucker
a
little
overpriced
in
my
opinion
pretty
impressive
after
the
initial
pour
two
finhger
frothy
light
amber
head
but
recedes
after
about
five
minutes
after
pouring
before
i
take
my
first
sip
pretty
good
for
a
barleywine
though
good
bubbling
too
very
toasted
malt
nose
brown
sugar
with
notes
of
light
and
dark
fruits
mixed
with
a
dash
of
molasses
great
nose
that
develops
more
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
complexity
increases
with
warmth
hints
of
toasted
pears
mix
with
herbal
hnts
of
tobacco
and
light
maraschino
cherries
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
wamr
but
not
overpowering
just
lets
you
know
that
tis
beer
need
to
be
sipped
drinkability
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
interesting
taste
i
think
overall
its
just
an
odd
combination
of
flavors
and
doesnt
work
for
me
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
nice
oak
scent
laid
over
a
malt
bill
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
the
hops
are
well
promounced
in
the
aroma
also
the
oak
scent
is
mild
yet
it
blends
in
well
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
toned
down
flavor
its
not
overly
malty
the
hop
bitterness
is
pronounced
as
well
as
the
oak
character
its
quite
dry
with
a
lingering
oak
taste
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
i
love
the
concept
of
using
oak
casks
it
can
really
enhance
the
complexity
of
certain
beer
styles
i
like
the
oak
in
this
one
but
im
not
in
love
with
the
lack
of
malt
presence
in
the
taste
its
seems
a
little
bland
and
dumbed
down
overall
this
is
a
good
drinker
but
not
my
favorite
barleywine
alcohol
is
fairly
well
masked
in
this
one
and
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
oaked
beers
ive
sampled
the
oak
elevates
the
beer
here
it
doesnt
dominate
it
as
it
does
in
so
many
other
oaked
beers
stu
i
found
this
beer
to
be
out
of
balance
and
not
very
pleasant
to
finish
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
overall
the
beer
is
a
pretty
interesting

that
was
definitely
worth
its
cost

complex
flavor
of

vanilla
with
some

soft
mouthfeel
with
some
carbonation
overall
a
very
tasty
barleywine
it
was
overpoweringly
sweet
with
a
thick
taste
of
molasses
not
a
style
of
beer
i
usually
gravitate
towards
but
this
one
is
supreme
in
its
class
maybe
the
best
i
have
had
since
sucaba
no
joke
thanks
to
thebrewo
for
procuring
this
one
and
bringing
it
out
to
me
here
in
colorado
looks
the
part
super
hazy
and
thick
short
khaki
foam
head
settles
in
a
couple
minutes
and
the
aroma
just
blows
my
mind
its
not
the
least
bit
hot
which
for
this
strength
is
insane
and
the
bourbon
on
it
is
enormous
the
vanilla
is
there
and
there
is
a
maple
sort
of
sweetness
but
its
not
over
the
top
the
grain
is
layered
in
there
beautifully
like
some
of
their
other
strong
beers
it
comes
in
waves
and
its
different
in
taste
and
feel
from
any
other
melting
toffee
warm
vanilla
custard
sweet
oak
maple
candy
golden
raisin
dried
date
and
buttery
crumb
topping
this
beer
is
amazing
with
the
bourbon
finishing
it
long
and
mellow
usually
big
barleywines
arent
my
thing
but
this
one
is
really
remarkable
cant
say
enough
about
it
and
how
they
continue
to
impress
me
each
and
every
time
i
have
a
new
beer
from
them
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
country
i
have
always
said
and
this
is
further
reinforcement
of
that
notion
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
during
a
bottle
share
pours
a
deep
brown
purplish
color
with
a
full
finger
of
dense
creamy
tan
head
which
dissipated
quickly
leaving
a
thick
out
lacing
ring
throughout
the
drink
aromas
of
booze
citrus
maybe
apple
bourbon
vanilla
and
oak
a
nose
full
more
like
wine
than
beer
tastes
of
vanilla
oak
caramelized
sugars
oak
but
finishes
sweet
and
boozy
definitely
apples
it
is
dry
like
a
wine
very
light
in
the
mouth
thin
medium
carbonation
little
too
dry
for
my
liking
but
it
grew
on
me
i
only
had
about
23
ounces
since
it
was
a
bottle
share
would
have
liked
a
full
glass
to
savor
and
see
how
it
changed
as
it
warmed
up
this
one
was
about
6
months
old
aged
in
a
refrigerator
i
would
assume
it
gets
better
with
age
but
not
much
it
was
a
steep
price
i
want
to
say
22
00
or
maybe
23
00
however
well
worth
trying
big
boozy
and
badass
just
the
way
i
like
my
english
barleywines
lots
of
bourbon
and
toffee
sticky
and
sweet
loaded
with
boozy
fruits
bourbon
is
big
and
up
front
fking
delicious
steep
price
but
worth
every
damn
penny
a
sipper
that
rocks
on
a
cold
blustery
day
might
warrant
a

aroma

a

and
just
a

worry
this

turn
a
little
sour
at
some
point
body
is
big
and
rich
and
bordering

syrupy
with

low

a

help
this

the

i

it
sounds
funny

the
bittersweet
bourbon
really
adds
a

glad
i
had

top
5
best
barrelaged
englishstyle
barleywines
overall
i
highly
recommend
the
beer
first
impressions
from
looking
and
smelling
the
beer
might
be
a
bit
underwhelming
but
after
tasting
the
beer
it
is
clear
that
this
is
a
gem
the
key
words
i
would
use
to
describe
this
beer
are
smooth
and
balanced
although
it
has
a
strong
bourbon
flavor
it
has
a
beer
to
match
its
intensity
the
drinking
experience
is
not
hampered
by
either
the
presence
of
a
spirit
in
the
beer
via
the
bourbon
barrels
or
the
fact
that
it
is
over
13
abv
i
would
buy
this
again
and
i
recommend
it
excellent
flavor
but
relatively
expensive
best
barleywine
ive
had
hands
down
in
its
style
as
good
as
east
end
gratitude
goes
down
way
to
easy
and
demands
to
be
sipped
and
savored
lush
and
lovely
d
overall
a
very
solid
brew
i
think
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
a
nice
example
of
style
the
soft
sweetness
decent
complexity
and
lack
of
overdone
boozy
bite
really
sold
me

d
this
was
a
nice
barrel
aged
barleywine
it
was
more
sour
than
i
was
hoping
for
at
first
but
that
faded
as
it
warmed
the
scent
and
taste
were
delicate
and
complex
and
the
body
was
fantastic
the
finish
was
fairly
smooth
but
alcohol
was
notable
so
it
was
better
to
sip
would
probably
age
well
but
still
enjoyable
fresh
overall
a
really
good
take
on
an
english
style
barleywine
good
toasty
and
fruity

with
just
enough
bourbon
to
add
a

my

the

this

reminded
me
of
sucre
and
earth

good
tasting
barleywine
very

with

has

it
tasted
exactly
what
youd

a
big
boozy
english
barleywine
aged
in

to

that
is

750ml
bottle
from
big
deal
irving
spofford
nh
o
the
layered
nature
of
this
brew
is
very
nice
and
its
unbelievable
that
the
alcohol
doesnt
come
through
more
than
a
slight
bit
in
the
finish
the
malts
and
barrel
compliment
each
other
extremely
well
and
makes
the
drinkability
even
that
much
greater
it
takes
some
patience
not
to
drink
this
down
quickly
but
you
might
find
yourself
on
your
ass
quickly
if
you
dont
take
your
time
and
sip
on
it
very
well
done
by
brooklyn
a
truly
standout
beer
that
will
likely
slide
under
the
radar
if
youre
on
the
edge
because
of
the
20
price
point
dont
hesitate
this
is
one
purchase
you
wont
regret
d
overall
this
beer
is
really
exceptional
and
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
brooklyn
a
fan
of
english
barleywines
and
especially
if
you
like
the
added
complexity
brought
by
aging
in
used
bourbon
barrels
like
most
of
brooklyns
barrel
aged
stuff
this
one
is
not
one
note
in
any
sense
and
the
complexity
is
fantastic
o
big
big
and
super
boozy
barleywine
very
malty
very
sweet
but
the
huge
alcohol
burn
really
cuts
it
down
and
keeps
it
from
being
overpowering
somehow
this
actually
improves
drinkability
otherwise
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
from
a
bourbonbarrel
english
barleywine
lots
of
sweet
caramel
and
breadiness
everywhere
o
overall
very
good
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
infected
due
to
that
off
tartlike
aroma
but
luckily
it
was
not
quite
tasty
and
definitely
worth
a
try

its
been
a

since
i
have
found
a
beer
that
really
surprised
me
and
that
was
partially
because
it
did
surprise
me
to
find
this
after
not
keeping
up
with
the
beer
scene
recently
and
being
completely
preoccupied
with
work
and
a
newborn
to
even
know
this
had
been
released
what
a
great
surprise
on
a
friday
night
and
even
more
so
after
tasting
o
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
but
a
fine
sipper
nonetheless
a
keeper
pours
into

oliver
ive
been
slapped
thank
you
seal
may
i
have
another
one
of
the
best
barleywines
ive
had
just
a
tad
too
sweet
couldnt
taste
the
alcohol
a
sweet
yet
smooth
barrel
aged
barley
wine
nice
caramel
and
toffee
notes
the
bourbon
is
light
the
barrel
does
provide
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
oak
could
use
a
year
of
aging
to
smooth
out
the
heat
alcohol
very
wellhidden
so
be
careful
with
this
one
overall
good
brew
but
has
room
for
improvement
i
will
say
its
definitely
beyond
worth
buying
i
know
its
sounds
crazy
but
it
is
what
it
is
spilt
it
with
a
friend
and
enjoy
salud
a
very
winey
nose
with
spice
bourbon
and
vanilla
pours
deep
bright
ruby
tinted
chestnut
with
a
very
finely
bubbled
light
tan
tinted
white
foam
cap
a
big
creamy
malty
bourbon
palate
with
traces
of
vanilla
wine
and
a
light
spicy
fruitcake
sweetness
that
leaves
a
little
stickiness
on
the
lips
finishes
with
a
balance
between
the
alcohol
bit
malt
bourbon
and
hop
bitterness
balance
is
maintained
with
this
beer
as
it
avoids
being
a
boozy
or
sugary
mess
and
while
i
give
way
to
hyperbole
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
wellcrafted
barleywine
that
has
everything
clicking
o
excellent
work
with
this
englishstyle
barleywine
easily
the
finest
offering
ive
had
from
brooklyn
brewing
and
as
far
as
my
palate
memory
serves
every
bit
as
enjoyable
as
king
henry
was
a
couple
of
years
ago
probably
a
20
bottle
in
these
parts
but
worth
every
penny
hand
and
seal
is
a
great
barrelaged
barleywine
a
better
example
of
its
style
than
black
ops
its
pricey
at
20
but
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
overall
a
very
good
ba
barleywine
another
great
beer
from
the
guys
up
in
brooklyn
hand
seal
picks
up
where
monster
left
off
an
amped
up
english
barleywine
base
with
the
added
benefit
of
some
time
spent
in
barrels
some
of
the
best
work
ive
had
from
brooklyn
d
highly
drinkable
considering
the
13
abv
this
brew
reminds
me
very
much
of
firestone
walker
double
dba
very
similar
flavor
profile
but
not
as
sweet
and
a
better
price
point
the
flavors
are
delicious
and
offer
a
nice
bba
profile
with
other
delicious
notes
of
vanilla
and
fig
not
complex
just
straightforward
flavors
that
pack
a
delicious
punch
25
4oz

with
a
14
inch
of

minimal
lacing
big
whiff
of

along
with
butterscotch
vanilla

the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
butterscotch
vanilla
and
bourbon
upfront
a
nice
oakiness
throughout
lots
of
alcohol
warmth
but
not
overly
hot
some
dark

with
maybe
a
hint
of
cinnamon
finishes
with
the
bourbon
and
oak
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
one
was
pretty
pricey
but
really
good
i
look
forward
to
aging
one
as
well
overall
fantastic
i
thought
this
was
an
amazing
barleywine
the
pour
was
a
deep
hazelamber
with
a
tan
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
full
of
heavy
flavors
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
and
then
the
alcohol
and
the
wood
from
the
casks
shine
through
in
the
finish
the
taste
was
forcefull
to
say
the
least
with
flavors
of
alcohol
strong
in
the
beginning
and
then
other
flavors
like
the
wood
and
the
hops
come
through
in
the
end
to
make
a
surprisingly
refreshing
barleywine
would
highly
recommend
its
long
and
savory
finish
is
suggestive
of
port
and
sherry
in
its
intense
flavors
and
warming
effects
as
it
overwhelms
the
senses
and
the
mind
a
dessertlike
satisfaction
sets
in
and
begs
for
strong
stilton
cheese
and
walnuts
in
accompaniment
low
b
bourbon
in
a
beer
get
it
does
the
bottle
i
had
was
a
2010
vintage
i
prefer
my
barleywines
on
the
maltier
side
and
this
certainly
did
not
disappoint
in
that
regard
there
is
oodles
of
complex
sweetness
to
enjoy
and
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
complement
it
admirably
the
instability
of
the
taste
toward
the
middle
is
an
unusual
detractor
but
it
didnt
prevent
me
from
enjoying
the
bigger
picture
this
bottle
had
a
year
on
it
when
opened
pours
a
golden
toffee
color
the
aroma
is
slightly
oaky
with
a
sherry
like
nose
easy
sipper
the
complexities
open
up
as
this
warms
i
feel
that
with
a
further
year
on
this
it
would
be
even
better
lots
of
sugar
and
dried
fruitcandied
fruit
elements
here
that
i
would
be
interested
to
stack
up
in
a
year
or
so
overall
pleasant
enough
at
first
but
lacking
enough
strength
to
make
a
lasting
impression
the
astringent
cherry
character
becomes
more
and
more
cloying
and
the
beer
would
be
hard
to
finish
if
it
werent
for
the
light
yet
detectable
balance
brought
on
by
earthy
hops
and
buttery
melanoidins
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy

some

also
dominated
by
some
caramelized

notes
with
some

then
i
would
have
expected
body
is
full
enough
for
style
with
good
amount
of

nice

but
i
thought
it
fell
a

overall
20
o
very
decent
barley
wine
would
prefer
a
little
less
hops
and
more
sweetness
still
very
drinkable
i
wasnt
the
hugest
fan
of
barleywines
which
is
why
i
went
so
long
without
buying
one
but
now
i
think
im
changing
my
stance
i
enjoy
the
insane
amount
of
malt
flavor
the
slight
tanginess
and
the
warmth
in
my
belly
from
this
one
the
feel
could
maybe
use
a
little
work
but
the
amount
of
sweetness
is
spot
on
any
more
and
this
beer
would
be
cloying
id
be
very
interested
in
buying
another
one
and
cellaring
it
for
about
five
years
or
so
the
only
real
flaw
i
have
with
this
brew
is
that
it
could
use
some
more
flavor
depth
i
could
find
that
in
the
bba
version
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
try
this
one
out
o
this
is
a
sipper
with
a
complex
malt
profile
i
laid
one
of
these
bad
boys
down
so
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
in
a
year
or
two
to
see
how
it
ages
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
robustness
of
flavoring
this
of
course
as
we
set
out
to
discover
was
vastly
different
across
the
years
of
the
vintage
the
freshest
edition
was
a
bit
harsh
giving
nothing
big
enough
for
the
booze
to
hide
behind
it
came
out
swinging
mixing
with
bright
chemical
phenols
cloying
sugars
and
plastics
for
a
curiously
imbalanced
sip
this
improved
a
great
deal
with
warmth
however
allowing
for
the
inherent
sugariness
of
the
malts
shine
through
strongly
enough
to
break
the
cycle
that
said
the
2010
vintage
was
vastly
superior
from
the
first
sip
and
then
after
it
started
with
the
desired
blend
with
the
booze
actually
hardly
noticeable
at
times
the
fruit
malts
and
muskiness
of
it
remained
clean
and
was
a
single
entity
by
the
end
this
was
an
exciting
revealing
experience
and
it
certainly
helped
us
to
refine
our
opinions
about
cellaring
vs
drinking
fresh
so
based
on
our
experiment
here
we
recommend
that
you
sit
on
the
fresh
cereal
killer
you
have
so
as
to
allow
it
to
calm
and
blend
enough
for
all
of
its
components
nooks
and
crannies
to
click
while
theres
a
richness
to
this
beer
the
body
is
medium
rather
than
full
and
it
works
it
supports
a
flowing
creaminess
overall
i
like
it
and
recommend
it
if
you
havent
tried
it
but
very
drinkable

this

all
around
nice
balance
and
complexity
of

and
fruity
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
even
better
with
a
couple
years
of
age
on
it
ive
been
on
a
journey
to
try
michigan
beers
lately
arcadia
ales
is
certainly
one
brand
that
stands
a
bit
taller
and
this
beer
contributes
to
their
stature
it
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
brownwith
only
a
small
amount
of
lace
the
smell
is
rather
complex
and
should
take
a
couple
whiffs
to
fully
appreciate
there
are
the
usual
toffee
smells
but
also
subtle
hints
of
cereal
the
taste
is
sublime
having
a
mellow
sweetness
balanced
with
the
aged
flavor
natural
to
this
type
of
beer
it
then
finishes
with
a
touch
of
bittersweet
thickness
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
barleywine
style
deep
murky

some

a

of

lightly
carbonated
medium

a
solid
and
serviceable
barleywine
a
very
enjoyable
slow
sipper
o
being
relatively
new
the
style
i
could
definitely
tell
it
fits
the
description
of
barleywine
but
cereal
killer
has
fallen
short
of
the
others
ive
tried
founders
bolt
cutter
dfh
olde
school
however
the
complexity
of
the
style
may
have
me
coming
back
to
this
one
in
the
future
o
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
like
barleywines
but
i
have
never
had
one
on
cask
this
beer
was
very
well
balanced
and
the
high
abv
was
hardly
noticeable
overall
doesnt
do
it
for
me
the
hoppiness
is
a
little
overdone
and
takes
to
much
away
from
the
malts
the
alcohol
is
too
overbearing
as
well
o
havent
had
this
fresh
but
it
is
nice
with
a
few
years
on
it
i
wish
the
alcohol
were
toned
down
just
a
bit
but
this
is
tasty
english
barleywine
o
very
pleasant
beer
a
nice
example
of
the
genre
im
impressed
with
how
the
sweetness
of
the
initial
flavour
which
is
considerable
is
balanced
by
the
bitterness
on
the
end
i
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
with
a
contingency
for
a
fourpack
and
i
think
ill
have
to
follow
through
on
it
at
10
abv
i
feel
this
beer
would
age
well
o
this
one
is
a
pretty
decent
sipping
barley
wine
which
has
developed
really
well
since
09
if
you
can
age
one
this
long
the
alcohol
dies
off
and
is
not
detectable
worth
picking
up
if
you
like
a
sipper
that
has
the
typical
barley
wine
malty
flavors
note
the
hops
have
died
on
this
one
cheers
o
i
would
of
rated
this
much
higher
if
it
werent
for
that
sour
fruit
nicely
spiced
nice
oily
mouthfeel
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
id
like
to
have
some
of
this
to
age
and
see
what
becomes
of
it
overall
nothing
really
to
run
out
again
get
again
especially
since
i
got
this
in
ohio
but
a
very
well
crafted
barleywine
12
ounce
bottle
2010
vintage
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
murky
mahogany
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
that
sticked
around
a
little
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
dark
fruit
raisins
plums
and
bready
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
the
addition
of
some
sherry
and
a
bit
of
sweet
spice
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
coating
and
a
bit
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
id
buy
this
again
in
the
future
and
probably
age
it
longer
next
time
o
this
is
a
classic
barleywine
and
it
would
make
a
great
first
introduction
when
introducing
friends
to
this
style
of
beer
it
does
all
the
things
a
barleywine
should
do
and
it
does
them
well
and
it
also
avoids
going
beyond
the
style
it
focuses
squarely
on
malt
flavors
of
sweetness
toasted
grains
and
just
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
along
with
some
yeast
most
of
all
everything
remains
subtle
and
smooth
and
blends
together
well
this
is
a
first
class
barleywine
that
is
definitely
in
the
top
tier
of
selection
available
in
this
style
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
dark
brown
sugar
raisins
prunes
and
plums
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
filled
with
lots
of
dark
and
brown
sugars
a
bit
of
non
descript
fruit
and
a
healthy
dose
of
ethanol
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
decent
barleywine
but
a
bit
on
the
hot
side
i
enjoyed
this
but
i
would
be
curious
to
see
how
a
little
age
might
affect
this
brew
o
not
the
best
barley
wine
ive
had
but
i
like
it
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
mind
aging
a
few
in
the
cellar
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
big
and
sweet
with
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
mostly
prune
dates
molasses
and
leather
the
booze
is
pretty
well
hidden
cereal
killer
is
not
as
complex
as
some
barleywines
i
have
drunk
if
you
like
your
barleywines
with
a
boozy
bite
cereal
killer
is
for
you
ill
have
another
o
nice
barleywine
that
is
quite
drinkable
worth
a
try
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
ive
been
exploring
this
style
more
but
always
come
back
to
this
compared
to
other
barleywines
this
one
goes
on
forever
in
depth
a
lot
to
enjoy
in
a
small
bottle
may
need
to
grab
a
750ml
next
time
not
really
great
some
weird
flavors
for
a
barleywine
and
way
too
sweet
even
while
cold
after
warming
became
almost
cloying
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again
o
this
beer
may
not
have
been
stored
properly
since
its
already
partially
oxidized
its
not
very
good
though
not
undrinkable
but
not
appetizing
either
o
i
dont
know
how
this
beer
is
fresh
but
this
four
year
old
bottle
gave
me
nothing
but
raisons
and
booze
if
the
smell
hadnt
been
so
overwhelming
it
probably
would
have
been
easier
to
drink
as
it
was
i
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
ill
be
holding
off
trying
another
barleywine
for
a
long
time
overall
solid
offering
here
would
like
a
little
more
sweetness
from
the
malt
profile
that
would
make
this
beer
really
tasty
im
not
sure
what
this
beer
tastes
like
fresh
but
its
very
enjoyable
with
2
years
on
it
o
very
enjoyable
a
nice
sipping
beer
that
improves
dramatically
with
warmth
this
one
aged
two
years
in
the
cellar
read
the
other
reviews
for
a
taste
profile
on
tap
this
was
a
perfect
beer
for
me
went
out
while
vacationing
in
detroit
and
bought
a
6
pack
to
bring
back
the
goodness
to
florida
not
nearly
as
good
from
the
bottle
much
more
hops
quite
bitter
which
is
fine
for
hop
heads
but
for
me
it
was
a
bit
less
balanced
than
when
it
was
on
tap
still
good
but
a
notch
down
from
great
hadnt
had
a
barleywine
since
a
bells
old
third
coast
like
a
year
ago
what
the
hell
was
i
thinking
time
to
dive
back
in
o
a
might
fine
barley
wine
its
a
heavy
hitter
at
10
but
drinks
better
than
that
enjoy
this
one
its
worth
a
try
pours
a
ruddy
reddishbrown
almost
garnet
color
with
a
nice
finger
and
half
worth
of
foamy
head
which
dissipates
quickly
with
marginal
lacingadhesion
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
rich
in
caramel
and
dark
fruit
raisins
figs
dried
cherries
all
present
however
i
find
it
a
bit
of
an
odd
scent
for
this
style
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
find
it
to
be
unique
in
a
little
bit
of
an
offputting
fashion
the
taste
resonates
with
the
nose
following
quickly
in
its
footsteps
more
raisins
lots
figs
even
dates
this
is
a
strange
bird
perhaps
when
youve
been
drinking
the
likes
of
abacus
commander
king
henry
and
blighs
recently
this
is
destined
to
seem
a
bit
more
ordinary
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
however
and
i
really
need
to
revisit
it
when
i
havent
been
on
a
binge
of
big
barley
wines
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
sweet
side
real
sweet
all
of
those
fruits
are
like
candy
theres
a
slight
tinge
of
booziness
in
the
finish
towards
the
back
of
your
throat
but
all
in
all
the
abv
is
hidden
pretty
masterfully
this
is
a
good
barleywine
on
the
grand
scheme
of
things
i
consider
it
average
only
because
of
what
else
ive
had
however
if
youve
never
had
patron
anejo
then
i
can
see
where
1800
comes
across
as
a
decent
enough
tequila
id
like
to
revisit
this
when
im
not
as
biased
towards
some
of
the
premium
offerings
overall
a
nice
treat
as
a
follow
up
consumed
later
at
a
room
temperature
and
vastly
improved
overall
drinking
experience
moving
overall
up
to
3
5
and
taste
to
4
in
future
will
drink
barley
wines
at
50
to
65
very
much
surprised
and
impressed
with
this
less
noticed
barleywine
i
would
definately
purchase
this
again
this
was
a
sledgehammer
of
a
beer
and
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
yet
it
packed
an
overwhelming
amount
of
boozesugars
malt
and
whuppass
at
times
i
had
a
tough
time
choking
a
sip
down
at
other
times
i
found
the
whole
thing
fabulous
i
like
barleywines
but
i
havent
figured
out
yet
if
this
was
incredibly
good
or
incredibly
not
good
best
bet
is
to
give
it
medium
marks
yes
you
ba
gurus
a
b
is
a
medium
mark
i
know
where
you
come
from
it
is
a
high
mark
but
on
earth
b
is
a
medium
mark
and
encourage
the
reader
to
try
for
themselves
overall
easy
to
drink
barley
wine
at
careful
speed
can
barely
feel
the
high
content
of
alcohol
in
the
beverage
very
good
when
freshthis
review
made
while
drinking
a
fresh
bottle
11
but
this
beer
can
definitely
be
laid
down
to
add
more
complex
flavors
to
it
o
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
afterdinner
beer
or
something
like
that
but
its
a
lot
to
handle
personally
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
english
barleywine
it
had
all
tho
flavors
that
you
would
expect
from
an
english
barleywine
no
added
tricks
like
some
of
the
american
ones
just
a
straight
forward
and
malty
barleywine
this
beer
has
pretty
good
drinkability
for
a
barleywine
its
not
too
boozy
or
too
bitter
i
should
have
no
problem
drinking
the
rest
of
this
bottle
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
had
all
the
nice
flavors
i
expect
out
of
a
malt
forward
barleywine
and
the
raisin
flavor
really
stuck
out
which
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
also
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
bad
it
was
just
very
sweet
and
somewhat
similar
to
a
sweet
sherry
and
the
head
was
pretty
lackluster
i
would
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
good
malty
barleywine
but
for
the
price
i
think
i
will
just
get
a
single
bottle
and
stay
away
from
the
four
packs
i
wish
it
was
a
little
cheaper
i
would
recommend
this
this
beer
to
people
who
like
malt
forward
barleywines
it
does
a
good
job
at
showcasing
some
great
malty
flavors
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
pretty
straight
forward
and
it
didnt
have
any
off
flavors
it
was
solid
arcadia
did
a
good
job
with
this
beer
and
i
think
it
would
get
even
better
after
another
year
i
also
think
this
would
make
a
great
candidate
for
barrel
aging
i
think
the
flavors
of
the
beer
would
go
great
with
some
bourbon
or
rum
barrels
this
beer
pours
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
dark
brown
color
it
has
a
fluffy
2finger
offwhite
head
resting
on
top
the
head
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
nice
bit
of
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
nice
bit
of
toasted
and
caramel
malt
there
are
also
some
aromas
of
dark
fruit
such
as
plug
fig
raisin
and
cherry
there
is
also
quite
a
bit
of
booze
coming
through
as
well
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
it
starts
off
with
some
sweet
bready
maltiness
there
is
a
nice
toasty
flavor
as
well
as
some
caramel
and
all
the
dark
fruit
notes
that
were
present
in
the
nose
there
is
a
good
bit
of
booziness
here
as
well
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
sweetness
toasted
maltiness
and
booziness
this
has
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
really
smooth
feel
to
it
there
is
some
sweetness
and
a
toasted
malt
bitterness
the
finish
leaves
some
boozy
warmth
lingering
in
the
mouth
and
throat
there
is
good
drinkability
here
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
flavor
is
really
nice
it
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
i
could
definitely
do
a
few
glasses
of
this
in
a
night
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
think
it
is
a
really
nice
barleywine
i
recommend
checking
this
one
out
i
would
buy
it
again
for
sure
beefy
englishish
barley
wine
i
like
it
very
well
done
arcadia
ales
nice
to
see
some
heavyhitters
on
the
bliss
docket
this
week
this
one
pours
a
kinda
murky
amberbrown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
caramel
acetone
buttery
toffee
light
biscuit
and
light
vanilla
im
sure
there
could
have
been
more
but
the
acetone
singed
my
nostrils
a
bit
the
taste
holds
notes
of
buttery
biscuits
deep
caramel
butterscotch
vanilla
nutmeg
booze
dark
fruit
and
light
honey
yeah
the
booze
is
still
pretty
strong
here
but
not
as
oerwhelming
a
force
as
the
one
that
met
my
nose
the
body
is
a
strong
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dry
finish
overall
this
bwine
is
something
of
a
challenge
to
really
get
into
but
its
not
all
that
unenjoyable
surprisingly
i
cant
really
explain
it
but
i
felt
generally
good
about
this
beer
after
drinking
it
despite
my
general
distaste
for
some
of
its
constituent
parts
odd
o
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
barleywine
at
least
better
than
its
rated
it
seems
better
balanced
than
most
and
a
bit
easier
to
drink
it
is
boozy
tasting
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
were
looking
for
a
full
fledged
barleywine
that
is
ready
to
drink
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
amber
color
the
head
was
tan
and
was
a
little
fizzy
the
lacing
and
retention
were
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
boozy
sweetness
along
with
some
fermented
dark
fruits
in
the
mix
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
a
little
sweet
upfront
and
then
it
fades
into
a
dry
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thick
which
wasnt
too
bad
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
brew
o
i
wouldnt
pour
this
in
my
cereal
i
was
blown
away
by
this
one
pours
a
nice
hazy
redorange
color
not
much
head
aside
from
a
thin
layer
that
quickly
dissipated
flavors
come
off
as
having
notes
of
dark
fruits
and
apple
with
spices
blended
in
subtly
it
reminds
me
of
an
apple
cider
more
than
anything
hops
provide
a
light
bitterness
that
works
with
the
malts
beautifully
i
realize
that
taste
is
subjective
but
this
is
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
ever
had
very
impressed
and
ill
be
buying
this
again
o
this
is
a
barleywine
to
be
enjoyed
by
those
who
do
not
like
the
hoppy
american
style
lots
of
malt
with
almost
zero
hop
taste
at
about
over
a
year
since
bottled
this
has
been
tamed
but
the
flavors
dont
jive
well
for
me
not
insanely
hot
the
english
ingredients
namely
the
yeast
is
what
gets
in
the
way
also
why
is
this
stuff
so
damn
expensive
o
overall
pretty
good
englishstyle
barleywine
easy
to
drink
but
not
much
complexity
o
a
decent
barleywine
i
dont
know
whether
this
got
better
from
the
years
but
id
speculate
that
its
best
fresh
it
seemed
very
tame
for
a
barleywine
on
the
other
hand
the
alcohol
was
far
from
sight
and
its
drinkability
was
very
solid
it
drinks
quite
smooth
but
i
cant
say
thats
something
i
personally
look
for
o
decent
barleywine
but
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
this
bottle
was
from
2008
i
dont
think
it
ages
well
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
arcadia
does
a
fine
job
with
their
specialty
beers
just
as
they
do
with
their
everyday
drinkers
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
barley
wine
one
that
ages
well
and
is
drinking
very
well
right
now
at
about
four
years
in
o
overall
nice
example
of
an
english
barleywine
pretty
even
tempered
but
i
like
a
bit
more
of
a
kick
and
thickness
to
an
english
barleywine
pretty
nonoffensive
and
nice
gateway
english
barleywine
ive
never
had
cereal
killer
fresh
but
aged
4
years
this
beer
is
absolutely
perfect
amazing
mouthfeel
with
one
of
the
most
balanced
robust
and
pleasantly
malty
flavor
profiles
of
any
barleywine
really
a
joy
thanks
again

courtesy

this
beer
pours
a
reddish
very
cloudy
copper
in
color
with
a
light
off
white
head
it
smells
of
biscuity
malts
molasses
honey
and
has
a
berry
sweetness
to
it
its
odd
and
too
sweet
it
tastes
of
sweet
malt
honey
and
molasses
its
far
too
sweet
for
my
liking
it
drinks
light
and
isnt
overly
sticky
which
is
surprising
considering
the
amount
of
sugar
you
get
from
this
beer
overall
this
beer
didnt
bring
anything
notable
to
the
table
it
was
average
and
overly
sweet
o
really
enjoyable
cant
say
its
amazing
could
use
more
character
maybe
too
drinkable
but
pretty
perfect
for
winter
nights
or
when
youre
wishing
for
them
overall
its
a
good
barleywine
with
the
malts
and
bite
of
alcohol
however
its
a
little
heavy
for
summertime
and
would
be
much
better
suited
during
winter
a
solid
barleywine
to
be
sure
i
think
this
would
probably
benefit
from
some
age
while
i
definitely
think
the
flavor
would
become
more
complex
with
age
the
body
is
already
on
the
thin
end
of
the
barleywine
spectrum
so
i
would
worry
about
it
becoming
even
thinner
still
i
think
that
3
to
5
years
out
this
could
be
a
fantastic
beverage
warming
to
the
palate
full
in
body
not
much
carbonation
very
boozy
o
its
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
that
it
is
a
very
strong
representation
of
the
style
rich
amber
color
almost
copper
in
hue
with
a
nice
touch
of
cloudiness
to
it
that
really
gave
it
a
very
thick
look
nearly
opaque
at
times
no
real
head
though
and
it
almost
looked
flat
at
first
pour
not
really
encouraged
right
off
the
bat
the
aroma
was
rich
and
sweet
nice
notes
of
bready
malts
hints
of
almost
honey
like
notes
and
a
nice
fruit
touch
toward
the
finish
the
flavor
though
really
perked
me
up
a
bit
sweet
mellow
with
all
notes
of
abv
long
gone
by
the
wayside
lots
of
biscuit
like
notes
a
touch
of
faded
hops
and
a
load
of
grain
all
combined
to
really
give
quite
a
nice
show
overall
very
impressed
here
with
the
way
it
tasted
especially
in
the
finish
which
was
again
very
sweet
and
nearly
perfectly
placed
an
easy
sipper
i
almost
went
through
this
one
too
quickly
as
it
had
mellowed
to
the
point
of
being
equally
rich
and
subtle
o
to
me
this
is
a
fantastic
barleywine
probably
a
little
pricey
4bottle
didnt
realize
it
until
i
was
checking
out
but
i
think
this
will
be
one
i
go
for
again
o
pretty
good
not
overly
thick
and
easy
drinking
for
10
have
not
had
it
fresh
but
certainly
a
beer
that
ages
well
not
much
changed
sort
of
an
off
aftertaste
not
as
syrupy
as
before
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
liquid
frosted
flakes
in
taste
seriously
this
is
a
delicious
barleywine
that
is
deceptive
in
its
alcohol
content
i
had
this
beer
in
a
halfpint
glass
at
arcadias
pub
in
battle
creek
michigan
and
i
was
very
impressed
a
lovely
deep
orange
beer
it
is
supersweet
and
delicious
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
overall
experience
highly
recommended
d
an
easy
drinking
barleywine
for
its
abv
yet
it
is
still
a
barleywine
1
or
2
is
usually
the
norm
great
flavor
from
the
malts
and
yeast
but
it
remains
a
one
and
done
type
of
beer
sweeter
than
the
smell
indicates
although
the
finish
is
dry
playing
second
fiddle
is
the
light
hop
and
mild
alcohol
warmth
the
body
is
similar
to
a
typical
barleywine
dhot
but
not
as
bad
as
some
hot
beers
i
will
definitely
make
this
beer
an
annual
winter
drinking
experience
just
a
cloying
and
sweet
mess
not
one
of
arcadias
better
offerings
arcadias
big
dicks
olde
ale
is
one
that
is
superior
in
just
about
every
way
i
would
not
recommend
this
drinkability
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
i
do
feel
that
i
need
to
find
a
fresh
one
at
some
point
to
make
sure
the
drinkability
is
there
for
this
one
in
general
or
if
it
takes
this
much
time
to
get
to
this
point
in
being
drinkable
wonderfully
sweet
and
well
balanced
flavors
and
a
very
robust
nose
make
this
one
very
enticing
but
the
abv
will
definitely
take
a
toll
at
10
great
for
a
cold
night
such
as
this
but
not
something
id
tackle
in
the
warmer
months
do
not
a
bad
barleywine
doesnt
hid
the
the
alcohol
too
great
but
thats
okay
drinkability
suffers
per
usul
with
the
style
was
actually
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
offering
due
to
its
5
price
would
buy
again
at
the
price
point
d
all
night
if
i
had
more
yeah
its
high
but
this
one
is
fantastic
if
you
can
find
a
2006
age
has
been
kind
to
this
one
as
it
comes
across
as
rich
and
leaning
more
towards
the
english
side
of
barleywines
sweet
and
doughy
good
blend
of
fruit
and
finishing
bitterness
nice
brew
straightforward
and
has
plenty
of
flavor
flavor
is
complex
but
again
not
overwhelming
sweetness
throughout
fruit
raisin
plum
pervade
extremely
smooth
arcadia
i
think
this
is
the
beginning
of
a
beautiful
friendship
dm
its
a
very
heavy
beer
that
coats
the
palate
great
creamy
head
and
texture
that
really
brings
out
the
flavors
i
was
able
to
find
a
bottle
from
2008
which
probably
made
it
a
little
stronger
d
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
english
style
barley
wine
with
its
strength
and
richness
you
only
want
one
but
that
one
is
very
nice
my
bottle
was
a
2008
vintage
d
meh
im
not
sure
if
id
be
that
quick
to
go
out
and
grab
any
more
of
these
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
in
a
style
that
i
consider
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
this
one
ranks
pretty
low
drinkability
arcadias
cereal
killer
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
considering
how
strong
it
is
the
great
taste
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
certainly
add
to
the
drinkability
i
would
certainly
have
this
one
again
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
pours
a
deep
copper
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruit
fig
plum
and
alcohol
in
the
taste
raisin
fig
licorice
and
a
small
alcohol
presence
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
fig
and
raisin
like
aftertaste
hides
alcohol
somewhat
nice
dry
fruit
presence
and
quite
smooth
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
it
might
not
be
the
best
ebw
out
there
but
its
still
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
drinking
for
a
while
and
also
worth
cellaring
for
a
while
drinks
well
booze
is
present
but
not
overbearing
sweetness
is
there
too
as
well
as
some
hoppiness
but
everything
remains
in
balance
quite
nicely
not
my
favorite
but
a
solid
solid
representation
of
a
balance
between
englishstyle
barleywines
and
their
hoppedup
american
relatives
m
full
smooth
and
soft
enjoyable
brew
not
one
that
you
could
drink
a
6pack
of
obviously
but
one
you
could
enjoy
one
or
two
of
at
a
sitting
great
flavors
and
decent
overall
experience
overall
a
decent
barleywine
but
not
among
my
favorites
in
this
style
overall
i
loved
it
and
i
think
i
might
have
to
get
another
nothing
to
complain
about
with
this
one
as
long
as
you
keep
in
mind
this
is
an
english
not
an
american
barleywine
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
13
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
decent
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
dark
citrus
and
slight
hop
fits
the
style
of
an
english
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
slightly
smooth
and
savory
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
dark
citrus
hops
slight
tartness
and
a
wood
flavor
overall
good
body
and
blend
with
a
great
mouth
feel
d
nice
balance
very
malt
forward
rich
difficult
to
make
it
through
a
glass
nothing
about
this
beer
really
stood
out
for
me
d
either
it
became
less
drinkable
as
it
warmed
or
i
just
started
to
get
tired
of
it
but
by
the
end
of
the
12
oz
it
was
not
nearly
as
good
as
at
the
start
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
barleywine
not
too
much
to
it
dont
think
id
go
for
this
one
again
with
such
better
options
out
there
the
high
10
abv
keeps
this
from
being
any
kind
of
a
guzzling
beer
but
i
found
it
quite
enjoyable
one
sip
at
a
time
notes
not
sure
of
the
vintage
of
this
bottle
my
guess
is
that
its
been
in
my
cellar
for
a
couple
years
which
would
make
it
an
08
or
more
likely
an
07
it
aged
fairly
well
a
nice
sipper
all
in
all
this
was
a
very
good
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
it
interesting
for
an
english
barleywine
could
cross
styles
with
an
old
ale
definitely
try
if
you
like
malty
big
beers
f
semi
sweet
finish
with
the
syrupy
taste
and
feel
lingering
a
bit
not
bad
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
also
somewhat
bitter
and
earthy
the
syrupy
maple
and
brown
sugar
flavors
seem
to
stick
around
for
a
while
and
the
hops
just
add
a
slight
touch
of
bitterness
it
almost
has
a
velvety
mouth
and
finish
which
adds
a
really
nice
touch
this
is
actually
better
than
i
thought
for
a
beer
d
ya
i
am
glad
i
didnt
buy
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
just
really
different
and
not
in
a
good
way
have
no
clue
what
that
bitterness
is
but
it
sucks
the
carbonation
is
unappealing
too
a
deep
dark
red
color
pour
with
a
big
lasting
fluffy
white
head
leaving
lots
of
sticky
lacing
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
dark
caramel
rasins
molasis
spicy
hops
and
maybe
cherries
flavor
is
of
sweet
brown
shugar
caramel
molasisspicy
floral
hops
datesrasins
wood
light
alcohaol
in
the
tail
end
nice
warming
effect
full
body
with
a
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
level
of
bitterness
long
sweet
finish
quite
drinkable
and
went
down
good
dispite
the
sweetness
a
very
good
offering
from
a
great
brewery
nice
dgood
but
not
really
drikable
with
its
high
abv
and
not
very
well
hidden
alcohol
presence
but
i
could
still
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
nice
malty
english
barleywine
great
sipping
beer
to
go
with
a
nice
blue
cheese
ddoesnt
have
the
complexity
i
would
have
like
to
see
but
big
bold
flavors
that
are
blended
very
well
together
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
present
in
the
middle
but
not
overpoweringly
so
i
could
drink
the
rest
of
this
bomber
then
it
is
time
for
a
milder
beer
the
sweetness
is
sure
to
get
to
me
notes
the
aroma
is
very
enticing
but
the
flavor
seemed
to
lack
a
little
even
for
an
english
style
still
decent
though
d
this
is
perhaps
too
old
nothing
is
really
impressing
me
about
it
at
this
stage
its
just
syrupy
boozy
burnt
raisins
figs
i
will
certainly
rereview
this
when
i
find
one
in
better
condition
fresher
overall
this
is
a
different
take
to
a
barleywine
than
what
i
had
become
acquainted
with
its
maltier
more
bitter
and
has
a
much
sharper
more
pointed
aftertaste
a
definite
try
but
not
one
of
my
most
favorites
in
the
category
d
sooo
happy
that
this
isnt
nearly
the
disappointment
i
thought
it
would
be
based
on
others
reviews
it
works
ok
for
the
style
i
would
definitely
say
its
a
slightly
better
than
passable
english
barleywine
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
good
carbonation
and
not
overly
heavy
or
syrupy
at
all
which
is
nice
this
is
definitely
a
malt
bomb
and
fits
the
english
barleywine
category
quite
well
i
think
the
age
has
worked
nicely
on
this
one
too
a
tasty
deep
fruity
barleywine
worth
checking
out
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
warming
smooth
and
chewy
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thick
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
beer
is
awesome
the
age
on
it
gave
away
to
fantastic
tasting
barleywine
the
flavor
profiles
are
complex
but
simple
the
alcohol
is
warming
and
not
harsh
this
beer
is
wonderful
drinkability
not
good
bw2
drain
pour
of
the
night
conclusion
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
englishstyle
barleywines
ive
had
which
i
generally
prefer
to
their
americanstyle
counterparts
this
is
wonderfully
balanced
rich
and
makes
a
great
cold
weather
latenight
beer
split
with
the
old
man
after
cellaring
for
a
year
or
so
i
will
not
be
going
back
to
try
this
beer
again
this
beer
is
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
and
somehow
syrupy
as
well
honestly
reminds
me
of
my
home
brew
when
i
used
all
extract
like
cheap
champ
this
beer
has
its
time
and
place
like
candyman
its
forgettable
i
go
through
trends
of
sticking
to
certain
styles
depending
on
the
time
of
year
and
in
this
case
it
has
all
been
about
hoppy
beers
and
barleywines
this
one
i
poured
in
to
a
weiss
glass
not
the
right
style
but
whatever
color
is
definitely
good
it
is
a
light
cherry
toward
the
bottom
and
gets
darker
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
almost
immediately
upon
pouring
i
could
smell
it
from
a
few
feet
away
dark
fruits
such
as
cherry
and
berry
strike
me
first
along
with
some
chocolate
and
alcohol
honey
manages
to
creep
its
way
in
as
well
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
cherry
cordial
taste
is
very
sweet
and
not
afraid
to
flex
its
alcohol
strength
i
get
some
honey
and
fruit
nectar
and
a
tiny
amount
of
molasses
or
caramel
in
the
finish
body
is
big
viscous
and
in
your
face
drinkability
is
nice
however
be
warned
that
this
is
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
that
should
probably
be
paired
with
food
i
have
only
had
four
or
five
sips
from
my
glass
and
can
already
feel
the
strength
of
this
beer
i
like
this
barleywine
not
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
tried
but
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
anybody
who
sees
it
in
their
area
cheers
ultimately
im
not
completely
sold
on
this
its
just
a
little
too
thick
and
sweet
and
feels
unbalanced
with
the
hops
too
far
in
the
background
to
really
integrate
with
the
flavors
its
definitely
delicious
and
lipsmacking
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
share
with
others
on
a
cool
evening
i
think
it
would
match
spectacularly
with
some
warm
bread
and
cheese
which
unfortunately
i
didnt
have
on
hand
not
very
eay
to
drink
at
all
its
very
much
a
sipper
just
to
sweet
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
so
i
can
judge
the
changes
it
has
made
with
a
couple
of
years
it
has
definitely
sweetened
up
and
dulled
the
hop
profile
good
but
i
doubt
ill
age
another
one
pours
deep
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
drops
to
no
lacing
aroma
is
syrupy
and
malty
flavor
is
overripe
and
sweet
with
strong
but
indistinct
hops
raisin
plum
sourness
and
toffee
mouthfeel
very
thick
and
gooey
the
finish
is
quite
heavy
and
sour
feel
like
i
need
to
brush
my
teeth
still
pretty
boozy
could
use
some
more
aging
it
was
the
perfect
beer
to
end
on
it
pairs
very
well
with
dried
dates
d
suggary
sweet
and
often
unbalanced
would
have
liked
a
little
more
malt
charachter
or
a
touch
less
sugar
to
balance
out
the
flavors
2008
vintage
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
dark
garnet
with
moderate
tan
head
it
smelled
like
dark
fruit
fig
and
raisin
and
prune
with
honey
wheat
and
roasted
barley
and
some
molasses
it
tasted
like
raisins
and
prunes
and
honey
wheat
with
copper
hops
and
caramel
and
molasses
malts
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
deep
rich
flavor
and
great
body
i
could
already
really
sense
age
on
this
beer
with
only
1
year
on
it
and
i
could
foresee
it
continuing
to
improve
for
another
year
or
two
nice
clean
flavors
that
were
balanced
quite
well
and
hid
the
alcohol
nicely
so
this
was
easy
to
drink
but
much
better
to
sip
well
done
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
great
barley
wine
tons
of
flavor
and
aroma
offerings
and
an
extremely
nice
alcohol
warmth
this
is
a
winner
drinks
like
a
barleywine
usually
does
its
a
sipper
but
a
tastey
one
d
a
very
nice
english
barley
wine
that
might
benefit
from
another
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
solid
nonetheless
and
firmly
on
the
sweet
end
of
the
barleywine
spectrum
dranks
alright
but
flavor
profiles
are
all
a
bit
shallow
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
other
arcadia
offerings
imo
of
emphasis
on
sugar
really
quite
good
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
2006
vintage
shared
with
psycohops
poured
into
an
adnams
pint
glass
the
barley
wine
appears
something
akin
to
murky
freshly
brewed
iced
tea
with
a
finger
of
light
ecru
foam
the
foam
settles
to
a
thin
layer
within
a
few
minutes
flavor
and
nose
consists
of
rather
sweet
smelling
brown
sugar
very
fruity
figs
dates
dark
cherries
still
a
touch
of
alcohol
making
it
a
tad
boozy
ample
carbonation
and
not
as
sweet
tasting
as
the
nose
would
suggest
the
flavor
drops
off
almost
instantly
upon
each
swallow
rather
smooth
with
a
light
finish
we
paired
this
with
some
cabot
hunters
seriously
sharp
cheddar
i
dont
know
if
this
one
is
drinkable
or
not
im
leaning
towards
not
ive
got
another
bottle
downstairs
which
ill
open
soon
if
its
any
different
ill
amend
this
review
mouthfeel
is
burnt
chocolate
malty
kind
of
funky
time
for
some
water
drinkability
is
average
first
beer
from
arcadia
i
had
hoped
for
a
better
beer
this
barleywine
is
acceptable
but
by
no
means
is
this
a
great
beer
poured
a
deep
copper
with
a
big
rocky
tannish

brown

drinkability
is
good
drinkability
is
ok
ive
found
that
since
i
am
a
hophead
i
prefer
american
barleywines
to
their
english
cousins
however
this
was
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
warm
burnt
toffee
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
caramel
malts
boiled
down
to
darken
the
color
and
intensify
the
malt
character
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
very
rich
malty
flavor
that
screams
burnt
toffee
and
low
hops
its
slow
going
down
with
a
nice
warmth
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
powerful
beer
with
loads
of
flavor
im
a
big
fan
of
the
malt
content
burnt
toffee
is
like
mothers
milk
not
bad
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
actually
liked
this
one
i
would
certainly
recommend
if
one
enjoys
the
maltier
earthier
style
a
deep
copper
caramel
color
thick
and
hazy
with
a
decent
oatmeal
colored
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
nutty
red
wine
and
deep
malt
earthiness
full
and
a
bit
sweet
the
flavor
is
a
strikingly
sweet
thick
grapey
malt
with
more
nuttiness
amazingly
syrupy
sweet
more
than
i
like
but
still
a
tastey
treat
full
bodied
not
a
session
beer
i
would
say
i
pick
up
some
maple
and
brown
sugar
mellows
as
it
sits
but
still
brings
a
tart
overtone
pretty
heavy

for
a
22
oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
2008
vintage
overall
a
very
good
barleywine
but
seemed
more
like
a
blended
american
and
english
instead
of
a
true
english
barleywine
the
hops
flavor
was
a
decent
surprise
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
bomber
picked
up
while
visiting
ann
arbor
mi
pours
clear
amber
with
inch
and
a
half
tan
head
it
has
a
citrus
hard
candy
aroma
cherry
candies
and
raisins
the
taste
has
that
same
fruity
hard
candy
noted
in
the
nose
with
sweet
citrus
cherry
and
grapes
then
an
undercurrent
of
mild
caramel
sweetness
runs
right
up
to
the
finish
and
into
the
aftertaste
d
probably
more
bitter
than
your
typical
english
barleywine
but
not
as
bitter
as
an
american
style
a
nice
sipper
not
a
booze
bomb
at
only
9
goes
down
pretty
smooth
drinkability
is
relatively
high
the
flavor
profile
is
pleasant
and
the
alcohol
is
in
check
making
for
an
easy
to
consume
barleywine
not
a
bad
effort
d
may
smooth
with
aging
the
malt
flavors
are
good
but
the
hop
bitterness
is
not
rich
enough
and
does
not
quite
blended
well
at
this
time
tastes
potent
malt
sweet
with
strong
hop
flavor
some
alcohol
sting
and
moderate
hop
bitter
malt
falvor
is
toffee
chocolate
and
biscuity
hop
flavor
is
so
potent
it
comes
across
as
sour
oranges
pine
orange
pith
and
tangerine
bitter
is
mild
and
clear
of
cohumulone
edginess
esters
are
thick
and
heavy
raisin
fig
tamarind
and
a
dash
of
cherry
a
decent
beer
but
too
sweet
persistent
i
suspect
this
would
improve
with
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
super
thick
mouthfeel
sticky
moderate
carbonation
oh
no
no
no
no
please
tell
me
this
wasnt
classified
as
a
barleywine
thats
an
insult
to
the
category
aroma
is
boozy
and
fruity
trying
really
hard
to
be
estery
but
falling
well
short
palate
is
far
from
substantial
flavor
is
of
simple
syrup
and
lots
of
it
a
dollop
of
caramel
and
a
splash
of
hawaiian
punch
as
for
hops
well
theyre
there
but
not
in
any
kind
of
force
they
certainly
dont
contribute
much
to
the
aroma
two
redeeming
factors
of
this
beer
1
it
looks
like
a
barleywine
and
2
i
didnt
have
to
pay
for
it
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
was
a
red
amber
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
provided
some
lacing
it
had
a
caramel
apple
aroma
similar
taste
caramel
apple
some
hops
the
alcohol
was
wellhidden
creamy
mouthfeel
not
too
aggressive
a
good
example
of
an
english
barleywine
beautiful
nice
head
maybe
a
bit
quick
for
the
lacing
to
go
away
wonderful
eb
smell
prunes
alcohol
light
apricots
sweet
malts
its
funny
though
its
called
and
english
bw
and
that
fits
some
of
course
it
could
also
be
an
american
bw
and
that
would
fit
some
the
problem
is
that
it
isnt
either
of
those
its
too
sweet
and
syrupy
not
that
its
sweet
and
syrupy
to
be
american
and
too
hoppy
and
bitter
not
that
its
hoppy
and
bitter
to
be
english
all
things
considered
its
probably
better
off
in
english
because
of
the
aroma
and
the
near
syrupy
sweetness
id
like
it
more
less
sweet
and
more
bitter
um
more
american
it
would
score
better
in
its
style
if
it
were
less
hoppy
d
drinks
really
nice
and
smooth
for
a
barleywine
great
drinkability
worthy
of
a
recommend
and
future
purchases
notes
from
22107
drinkability
im
not
always
a
fan
of
englishstyle
barleywines
but
this
one
is
quite
good
worth
a
try
and
at
7
99
a
bomber
the
price
is
right
overall
if
you
like
malt
give
it
a
try
on
my
taste
buds
like
no
other
this
beer
was
very
malty
and
strong
in
alcohol
on
the
other
hand
its
also
smooth
and
accessible
this
is
good
barleywine
shortcomings
though
there
are
this
could
do
with
a
good
cellaring
i
liked
this
barleywine
alot
maybe
because
i
drank
it
outside
during
a
cold
and
rainy
day
still
its
sweet
and
powerful
and
makes
for
a
good
nightcap
or
as
a
dessertbeer
on
its
own
recommended
this
barleywine
poured
a
murky
brown
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
the
nose
was
fairly
light
with
only
traces
of
raisins
and
dates
the
beer
tasted
of
brown
sugar
toasted
bread
raisins
dates
and
a
bit
of
lemon
the
beer
was
a
bit
fizzy
but
overall
was
a
decent
representation
of
a
barleywine
drinkability
iffy
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
tasty
but
too
overly
sweet
a
decent
take
on
a
english
bw
and
im
happy
to
enjoy
it
but
not
enough
to
move
back
to
the
dirty
coast
not
a
bad
price
either
but
also
something
that
a
non
bw
drinker
would
probably
call
icky
i
cant
wait
to
brush
my
teeth
this
is
one
michigan
barleywine
to
please
anyones
palate
nice
one
but
one
is
about
all
anyone
can
handle
cereal
killer
barley
wine
a
great
name
is
surprisingly
delicious
going
with
the
theory
that
it
might
have
had
more
power
and
presence
when
young
i
will
try
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
i
have
to
say
though
its
damn
good
aged
d
ok
beer
average
not
that
impressed
dark
brown
colored
ale
with
a
one
inch
light
brown
head
aroma
is
alcohol
and
fruit
taste
is
sugarmore
sugarfruit
and
alcohol
this
is
my
first
barley
wine
and
i
was
not
overly
impressed
a
person
could
go
into
a
diabetic
coma
if
you
drink
more
than
one
this
ale
was
not
horrible
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
seek
out
anytime
in
the
future
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
but
its
nothing
im
going
to
get
exited
about
i
felt
the
hops
were
a
little
tame
or
the
style
and
the
candy
flavor
just
seemed
off
its
not
bad
but
its
nothing
spectacular
either
according
to
the
lable
its
a
2007
vintage
judging
by
the
flavor
i
would
say
its
early
2007
giving
it
more
than
a
year
this
one
is
probably
best
enjoyed
fresh
i
throughly
enjoy
this
brew
this
will
be
added
to
the
cellar
fairly
soon
as
i
would
love
to
taste
an
aged
version
of
this
great
brew
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
ale
and
only
its
high
abv
limits
its
sessionability
some
seemed
to
like
it
so
chalk
it
up
to
personal
taste
i
guess
but
i
didnt
feel
like
the
flavors
in
this
one
were
in
order
too
much
alcohol
and
too
much
buttery
sweetness
this
is
okay
just
too
damn
sweet
and
syrupy
couldve
used
more
balance
i
like
sweet
beers
but
they
need
to
have
more
depth
than
this
again
ill
say
barleywines
are
like
pizza
and
sexeven
when
its
bad
its
good
and
cereal
killer
is
somewhere
between
good
and
bad
love
the
name
though
thanks
vancer
for
the
opportunity
dnotes
i
wouldnt
call
this
beer
particularly
drinkable
decent
but
not
great
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
overall
a
very
nice
barleywine
ill
enjoy
more
of
as
a
barley
wine
im
enjoying
this
as
an
english
barley
wine
im
enjoying
it
even
more
well
worth
trying
d
you
feel
the
alcohol
after
just
a
few
sips
it
certainly
doesnt
hide
that
well
enough
flavor
and
character
to
warrant
a
second
pour
but
that
might
just
be
the
wintry
blast
outside
making
me
want
it
tastes
similar
to
the
nose
caramel
malts
fruits
citric
hops
with
the
alcohol
coming
through
to
warm
my
cheeks
oelergud
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
but
i
doubt
that
ill
seek
this
out
again

d
this
is
what
i
think
of
as
an
american
barleywine
big
sweet
malty
flavor
even
though
it
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
followed
by
a
big
pungent
hop
punch
that
finishes
it
the
hops
really
balance
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
really
supports
the
hops
ugh
what
a
mess
ugly
flavors
all
over
i
wasnt
impressed
with
arcadia
the
last
time
i
tried
their
lineup
a
few
years
ago
and
it
seems
they
still
havent
figured
out
how
to
brew
a
good
beer
since
then
i
was
hoping
this
big
beer
series
might
prove
me
wrong
it
didnt
this
is
a
wonderful
americanstyle
interpretation
of
an
englishstyle

it

a
have
cereal
quality
in
both
nose
and

which
is
interesting
its
not
the
best
barley
wine
in
the
world
but
its
new
years
eve
and
i
am
enjoying
the
hell
out
of
this
one
bottle
poured
a

really
sweet
with
a
caramel

scent

it
with
a
bit

is
disappointing
too
sweet
for
my
liking
very
fruity
and
not
hoppy
enough
for
my
liking
very
sugary
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
arcadia

pick
for
a
battle

this
beer
poured
a
clear
deep

light

that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
of
malt
dark
fruit
with
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
present
it
has
a
medium
body
with
a
slightly
astrigent
yet
bittersweet
finish
it
would
probably
improve
with
some
aging
d
quite
drinkable
given
the
strength
best
beer
ive
had
from
them
in
years
cheers
pretty
tasty

too
sweet

predominate
taste

all
malt

sugar
way
too
sweet
for
me
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
borderline
watery
and
thin
i
had
a
glass
but
thats
it
the
alcohol
and
the
sugar
make
this
one
a
sipper
and
a
fairly
unenjoyable
one
at
that
perhaps
ive
just
been
spoiled
by
old
ruffian
and
old
guardian
ive
not
had
many
barleywines
that
can
stand
up
to
them
i
am
not
100
percent
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
i
think
i
will
have
to
try
it
again
some
time
in
the
future

like

attempt

i
think
my
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
might
be
unfairly
penalizing
it
as
its
up
against
some
of
the
heavyweights
from
britain
in
my
mind
while
its
not
up
to
that
level
i
do
quite
enjoy
this
offering

i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
it

not

much
in

category
maybe
some
age
would
help
this
one
blossom
drinkability
while
never
overly
complex
i
found
it
to
be
quite
nice
quite
drinkable
and
it
really
delivered
when
i
was
looking
for
a
beer
with
a
lil
kick
to
it
overall
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
tried
i
prefer
the
english
style
to
the
american
style
and
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
i
wish
i
could
find
this

closer

would
definitely
get
more

update
i
stand
behind
how
good
this
one
tastes
this
is
more
a
cellaring
update
i
had
2
more
bottles
in
the
cellar
for
future
enjoyment
one
developed
an
infection
on
par
with
leaving
an
open
bottle
with
beer
on
the
counter
for
a
week
or
two
disgusting
and
apparently
not
necessarily
an
isolated
occurance
i
drank
my
other
bottle
last
night
and
it
was
perfect
the
moral
of
this
update
cellar
at
your
own
risk
drink
recent
from
the
store
and
check
the
bottles
before
you
buy
i
prefer
arcadias
hopmouth
dipa
over
this
still
its
a
decent
choice
for
a
barleywine
you
could
really
do
worse
yet
you
can
do
much
better
too

honestly
i

other
than
a

in

finish
it
started
out
promising
but
seed
to
fizzle
out
a
bit
no
pun
intended
still
not
all
bad
the
body
is
not
as
full
as
i
would
expect
nice
light
carbonation
not
too
sticky
sweet
but
a
perfect
balance
of
bitter
one
of
the
more
easily
drinkable
barleywines
ive
had
definitely
the
best
english
barleywine
ive
had
though
i
would
hesitate
to
label
it
as
either
british
or
american
but
rather
a
good
balance
between
the
two
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
chewy
sweet
with
fruit
and
caramel
breadiness
running
along
the
palate
clear
and
dark
amber
starts
this
one
off
a
smallish
ivory
head
caps
it
im
a
bit
bummed
by
the
aroma

only
weak
caramel
malts
pop
up
none
of
the
classic
bw
aromas
taste
also
lets
me
down
with
the
sharp
hoppy
finish
reminds
me
more
of
an
ipa
than
bw
medium
bodied
brew
i
dont
think
ill
seek
out
another
bomber

too
many
better
bws
out
there
cheers
d
the
alcohol
betrays
itself
but
not
to
the
10

ill
have
a
glass
or
two
tonight
but
not
much
more
as
the
malts
are
not
for
pounding

this
isnt
all
that
pungent
the
taste
is
hoppy
with
dark

this
combination
works
making
this
a
very
tasty
beer
the
mf
is
medium
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
very
well
a
real
nice
surprise
i
havent

drinkability
is
on
a
im
one
and
im
done
basis
i
need
to
move
on
after
one
of
these
big
brews
comments
could
be
evened
out
a
bit
more
with
hops
although
i
do
enjoy
sweeter
barley
wines
its
worth
a
try
but
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
this
beer
has
a
very
dark
mahogany
hue
to
it
nice
big
head
that
eventually
fades
a
lot
but
little
laces
are
still
present
big
huge
predominant
fruity
nose
taste
is
of
once
again
a
huge
fruit
attack
grapes
plums
apples
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
a
smige
of
hops
at
the
end
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
i
think
this
beer
is
alright
but
its
too
in
your
face
fruit
action
going
on
i
wanted
some
more
caramel
to
come
through
possibly
with
some
aging
this
beer
can
improve
but
as
for
right
now
i
most
likely
wont
pick
this
up
again
in
the
near
future
couldnt
drink
a
bunch
of
this
but
it
would
be
fun
to
try
btw
the
name
is
too
cute
and
the
label
art
interesting
hmmm
the
spoon
as
weapon
gotcha
scratched
out
fruit
loops
very
funny
but
i
have
to
say
it
reeks
as
trying
too
hard
maybe
too
much
cleverness
is
a
bad
thing
thats
my
experience
ive
got
the
scars
to
prove
it
cereal
killer
is
an
excellent
barleywine
it
is
pricy
but
you
do
get
what
yo
pay
for
pours
a
hazy
deep
dark
amber
with
reddish
streaks
shinning
through
from
the
light
striking
through
the
aroma
is
very
malty
carmelized
malt
slight
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
very
rich

this
is
a
great
beer
give
it
a
try
good
appearance
bloodied
mahogany
thick
beige
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
lace
behind
nice
aroma
of
plums
dates
pineapple
caramel
malts
and
other
tropical
fruits
nice
viscous
feel
in
the
mouth
full
bodied
and
adequately
carbonated
first
impressions
are
of
rich
malts
fruits
and
alcohol
really
a
pretty
nice
combo
overall
tropical
sensations
mix
with
caramel
malts
one
of
the
better
arcadia
brews
ive
had
a
nice
smooth
easy
drinking
bwine
nothing
overly
special
but
worth
checking
out
if
you
see
it
drinkability
soso
this
brew
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
needs
a
bit
more
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
alcohol
sticks
out
too
pretty
solid
barleywine
this
beer
hides
the
abv
well
which
is
its
best
feature
perhaps
im
just
unfamilar
with
the
englishstyled
barley
wines
but
i
expected
more
from
arcadia
here
probably
wont
spend
the
8
for
this
one
again
overall
a
mellow
fun
drinking
barleywine
style
ale
starts
off
smooth
and
the
bite
creeps
in
nicely
on
the
finish
yeah
this
beer
just
came
with
a
great
presentation
the
colour
is
something
short
of
purple
with
a
rich
redness
bleeding
out
at
the
edges
the
most
astonishing
feature
is
the
hearty
and
steadfast
head
that
perches
itself
atop
the
glory
below
i
am
generally
unaccustomed
to
seeing
such
a
resilient
head
on
brews
of
this
nature
nicely
coloured
in
a
shade
of
tan
there
are
a
few
streamers
of
lace
left
hanging
as
the
consumption
activities
commence
the
nose
is
commendable
in
its
lack
of
rotting
overtones
as
always
with
my
particular
nose
i
smell
appleskins
right
off
the
top
chalky
yeast
behind
it
dark
fruit
black
cherry
caramel
apple
candy
and
a
little
a
little
booze
float
around
as
well
way
more
pungent
as
it
warms
up
in
my
sweaty
little
mit
the
taste
is
most
notably
to
me
quite
sour
on
the
first
impression
a
fair
bit
of
sweetness
to
her
also
makes
me
think
much
of
cherries
and
caramel
this
is
dangerously
close
to
reaching
the
no
no
land
of
cloy
it
might
be
i
havent
yet
decided
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
but
sticky
there
is
a
trail
left
behind
as
this
brew
slides
down
the
hatch
this
trail
provides
seconds
of
additional
enjoyment
on
every
sip
very
nice
the
drinkability
might
be
slipping
now
as
i
am
starting
to
dwell
on
whether
this
thing
is
starting
to
get
its
cloy
on
the
first
pint
is
gone
what
will
the
rest
reveal
after
pouring
the
second
glass
which
has
been
exposed
to
ambient
temperature
for
the
duration
of
the
first
glass
the
taste
seems
quite
easy
to
deal
with
again
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
it
is
quite
rich
i
dont
think
serial
glasses
of
this
are
indicated
the
aftertaste
gets
to
be
a
bit
overwhelming
split
this
bomber
and
things
should
go
smoothly
besides
that
would
be
most
advocatory
of
you
this
is
surely
a
one
cup
affair
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
poured
into
a
chalice
color
is
deep
mahogany
with
an
awesome
looking
billowy
tan
head
that
dissipates
slowly
as
the
glass
sits
for
a
while
smells
sweet
like
brown
sugar
or
bubblegum
which
may
be
the
alcohol
theres
also
some
citrus
here
very
nice
scent
intriguing
tastes
like
a
lemon
flavored
bubblegum
and
finishes
sour
with
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
nothing
spectacular
it
is
a
little
harsh
but
again
could
be
the
alcohol
by
no
means
is
this
a
poor
beer
actually
its
one
of
the
better
arcadia
offerings
not
quite
as
good
as
hopmouth
worth
a
shot
drinkability
a
solid
bw
a
little
spendy
but
still
good
pours
a
rich
mahogany
with
a
substantial
head
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
an
amazing
aroma
of
cantaloupe
and
malt
very
nuanced
flavor
with
some
esters
thick
malt
with
a
support
of
alcohol
some
fine
hop
bitterness
that
shows
up
at
the
end
with
just
a
bit
of
slickness
full
bodied
and
assertive
i
poured
half
a
bomber
into
a
glass
thats
about
enough
for
one
sitting
tried
arcadias
big
dicks
olde
ale
and
this
backtoback
this
beer
is
the
better
of
the
two
however
like
the
former
beer
there
isnt
much
distinctive

i
would
recommend
this
beer

with
a
mellow

feel
a
very
malty
sweet
buttery
warming
barley
wine
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
ok
so
this
is
not
quite
the
cereal
that
one
might
expect
to
pour
in
their
bowlglass
for
a
barleywine
but
as
an
example
of
the
english
style
and
not
the
american
which
i
favor
this
is
quite
solid
malty
rich
and
favorable
for
malt
lovers
alike
too
bad
the
aroma
did
nearly
nothing
for
me

nice

maybe
somewhat

for
an

definitely

in

series
alcohol
is
very
present
throughout
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
tall
head
that
falls
quickly
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the

not

some
caramel
some
toffee
nice
the
flavor
is
very
malty
with
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
but
not
much
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
make
this
very
enjoyable
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
by
the
malt
sweetness
and
it
drinks
very
well
the
body
is
moderate
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
in
a
long
time
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
slightly
bigger
than
medium
bodied
the
beer
has
a
slightly
buttery
mouthfeel
the
beer
drinks
ok
i
probably
will
not
be
repeating
another
session
with
it
bomber
bottle
purchased
good
ole
new
beer
in
nyc
2006
vintage
info
provided
nice
to
find
on
a
bwine
not
that
i
put
any
beer
away
for
more
then
a
few
weeks
anyway
pours
murky
dark
honey
bready

this
is
an
easy
drinking
smooth

thick
full
of
malty
goodness
nice
notes
of
wood
and
rum
in
the
long
finish
pleasant
understated

brew
well
worth
a
try
nice
after
dinner
sipper
this
barley
wine
was
a
little
thin
and
dry
predominantly
a
caramel
dried
fig
approach
with
toasty
buttery
finish
finish
is
thin
and
somewhat
bitter
i
have
no
idea
what
this
beer
was
like
fresh
i
only
scored
one
bottle
and
i
sat
on
it
a
couple
years
before
drinking
it
i
was
very
impressed
though
the
feel
was
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
and
after
two
years
it
still
provided
a
good
blast
of
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
bourbon
barrel
aging
is
perfect
for
an
english
barleywine
and
this
one
shows
all
the
wonderful
qualities
youd
look
for
i
rate
this
one
slightly
above
insanity
yet
far
far
behind
sucaba
and
bcbw
if
i
ever
got
another
bottle
id
age
it
a
little
bit
longer
before
drinking
3
years
minimum
aged
very
well
overall
really
impressive
kinda
simple
but
theres
no
excess
sugar
and
it
isnt
too
boozy
o
this
barley
wine
absorbs
a
lot
of
bourbon
characteristics
it
is
sweet
but
not
overtly
so
it
is
an
enjoyable
tasting
experience

tastes
more
of
the
same
this
stands
out
as
one
my
all
time
favorite
barleywine
experiences
very
malt
forward
with
no
real
hop
presence
which
is
expected
of
the
style
the
booze
is
covered
up
very
nicely
cereal
killer
is
my
go
to
barleywine
and
the
bourbon
takes
it
to
the
next
level
cant
for
them
to
brew
some
more
highly
recommend
sip
on
this
and
then
hit
the
gym
my
children
yall
getting
fat
nothing
really
notable
going
on
here
a
rather
routinely
pretty
good
barrelaged
barleywine
if
such
a
beast
exists
this
side
of
the
river
styx
o
i
was
searching
this
one
out
for
awhile
and
i
wasnt
disapointed
yes
the
mouthfeel
could
be
fuller
and
it
is
a
barrel
forward
beer
which
i
dont
mind
but
i
find
it
complex
enough
its
doing
all
the
right
things
for
the
style
so
i
dont
really
agree
with
some
of
the
ba
reviewers
on
this
one
but
to
each
his
own
on
that
note
seek
this
one
out
if
you
think
you
can
dig
it
looking
forward
to

is

with
the

i
have
read
several
other
reviews
that
comment
on
strong
alcohol
qualities
mine
sat
in
my
cellar
aka
dark
closet
for
4
months
this
must
have
taken
the
edge
off
as
i
could
not
be
more
impressed
with
with
the
smoothness
and
ease
m
big
medium
to
full
o
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
especially
after
smelling
it
but
the
taste
just
has
too
much
alcohol
up
front
at
the
moment
it
gets
considerably
better
as
it
warms
up
but
it
is
very
strong
its
a
little
overcarbonated
but
the
nose
is
great
id
rank
this
slightly
behind
the
ba
stout
and
way
behind
the
ba
porter
though
i
could
see
this
being
much
better
with
more
time
on
it
will
hold
onto
my
other
bottle
for
a
while
at
least
a
year
o
something
is
off
but
it
has
the
potential
it
just
falls
flat
did
not
get
much
bourbon
presence
as
i
had
hoped
but
was
happy
with
that
because
i
found
what
taste
to
be
strange
it
was
just
too
dry
for
my
liking
and
had
a
strange
after
taste
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
i
was
not
impressed
maybe
ill
try
it
again
because
it
is
reasonably
priced
b
good
but
not
exceptional
for
the
most
part
the
alcohol
feels
like
that
of
a
much
stronger
beer
1518
would
have
been
my
expectation
id
have
to
try
another
regular
cereal
killer
to
get
an
accurate
idea
of
what
the
barrel
is
really
adding
here
but
it
isnt
anything
super
obvious
a
little
more
body
a
less
alcohol
would
make
a
big
improvement
in
my
perception
of
this
beer
o
i
dont
get
this
one
but
im
not
confused
as
to
why
others
enjoyed
this
i
would
like
to
revisit
at
some
point
but
not
holding
my
breath
for
it
still
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
home
run
slam
dunk
really
wonderful
ba
barleywine
if
anything
maybe
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
but
it
comes
in
a
12oz
serving
this
is
ok
it
isnt
great
but
it
wasnt
a
drainpour
worth
trying
but
not
trading
for
overall
a
good
beer
not
great
and
im
not
sure
worth
8
for
a
12oz
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
almost
all
the
aspects
that
i
expect
from
the
style
with
lots
of
malt
bourbon
barrel
and
warming
alcohol
and
its
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
like
tonight
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
the
flavors
held
my
attention
but
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
and
warming
alcohol
would
prevent
me
from
having
another
one
12oz
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
and
its
a
great
format
for
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
the
balance
in
the
taste
they
were
both
pretty
good
and
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
wasnt
bad
but
the
body
was
just
too
thin
for
the
style
and
it
needs
to
be
thicker
and
chewier
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
they
choose
to
release
it
again
its
already
gone
in
my
area
for
the
year
but
i
made
sure
to
grab
two
extra
bottles
to
throw
in
the
cellar
and
i
will
be
interested
to
see
how
it
ages
and
ill
try
and
update
this
review
but
the
price
is
on
the
steep
side
if
it
was
anymore
than
7
49
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
but
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
didnt
blow
my
mind
and
i
think
i
like
the
barrel
aged
shipwreck
porter
a
little
more
but
this
was
still
a
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
and
it
was
a
nice
sipper
and
its
a
good
cold
night
treat
good
job
arcadia
thanks
for
bottling
this
beer
its
nice
to
have
a
tasty
barrel
aged
barleywine
while
i
wait
for
the
next
release
of
shipwreck
porter
i
think
22
months
is
the
perfect
amount
of
time
for
this
beer
to
sit
in
the
barrel
and
its
worth
the
wait
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
2014
edit
just
tried
one
from
my
cellar
thats
year
old
it
got
very
smooth
almost
as
smooth
as
the
three
year
old
special
edition
the
bourbon
barrel
is
toned
down
a
little
but
it
still
comes
through
with
some
great
toffee
caramel
and
dark
fruit
flavors
it
aged
well
and
i
like
that
its
smoother
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
fresh
bottle
since
the
barrel
aspect
was
more
apparent
still
got
one
left
that
i
might
wait
a
year
to
try
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
bourbon
and
wood
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
better
smell
in
my
opinion
o
just
like
thier
barrel
aged
stout
this
beer
is
very
good
just
not
worth
8
i
payed
for
it
overall
a
very
well
balanced
barleywine
surprisingly
not
very
boozy
for
being
aged
22
months
like
its
imperial
stout
counterpart
o
a
real
nice
beer
scratch
that
a
great
beer
nice
complexity
fairly
easy
drinking
and
just
a
great
sipping
beer
to
enjoy
and
warm
your
belly
and
heart
this
is
a
terrific
barley
wine
that
im
so
glad
i
finally
got
to
enjoy
drink
this
and
love
it
overall
a
fairly
good
and
unique
beer
even
though
the
beer
is
closer
to
a
dipa
instead
of
a
barleywine
the
beer
still
manages
to
have
a
nice
malt
presence
that
turn
the
hops
into
the
carriers
of
the
fruity
notes
traditionally
found
in

would
like
a

from

however
very
good
brew
that
surprisingly
is
still
sitting
on
a
lot
of
store
shelves
in
my
area
prost
looks
like
a
liquid
tootsie
roll
smells
of
port
wine
tastes
super
smooth
with
not
much
alcohol
bam
for
a
beer
thats
11
overall
terrific
opened
on
my
bday
march
22
2015
pours
a
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
small
thin
off
white
head
one
of
the
more
opaque
barleywines
ive
seen
smell
is
lovely
lemony
hops
and
rich
honey
sweet
malt
and
caramel
subtle
earth
tones
you
can
really
smell
the
age
and
history
that
this
beer
has
taste
is
absolutely
sublime
perfectly
complex
and
robust
but
with
no
overwhelmingly
distracting
flavors
brown
sugar
bitter
chocolate
fig
plum
some
notes
of
aged
tawny
port
myriad
of
different
flavors
to
enjoy
that
subtly
change
as
the
beer
warms
feel
is
full
bodied
low
carbonation
slick
and
smooth
but
not
super
sticky
no
booziness
but
some
subtle
warmth
in
the
gut
overall
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
the
qualities
all
combine
to
give
this
an
ancient
and
timeless
presence
one
of
my
new
favorites
and
worth
the
wait
to
cellar
damn
good
sf
beer
week
from
a
tap
i
was
surprised
i
almost
went
with
something
else
but
im
glad
i
chose
this
one
delicious
till
the
last
drop
complex
and
bold
would
order
again
in
a
heartbeat
kind
of
surprised
but
i
loved
this
beer
sweetness
and
little
else
honey
overall
this
is
not
quite
the
bcbwine
but
getting
there
it
doesnt
come
together
quite
as
well
2014
release
excellent
barleywine
get
this
if
your
a
barleywine
fanatic
like
myself
i
give
it
a
solid
9
6
out
of
10
overall
really
nice
barleywine
i
think
they
found
a
good
ratio
between
the
barrel
aged
and
non
barrel
aged
component
as
any
more
would
have
overwhelmed
the
base
beer
characteristics
if
they
release
this
again
ill
definitely
pick
up
another
overall
been
dying
to
try
this
for
months
so
worth
the
wait
oflavor
explosion
this
was
a
fantastic
balance
of
barley
wine
and
the
wine
character
the
hop
presence
seemed
to
pickup
as
my
pallet
adjusted
to
all
the
different
flavors
one
things
for
sure
this
was
complex
and
delicious
o
this
beer
is
just
as
delicious
as
it
is
drinkable
which
equals
dangerous
so
wellbalanced
between
the
malt
sweetness
barrel
character
and
alcohol
content
also
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
spoton
i
think
i
like
this
at
least
as
much
as
sucaba
if
not
more
i
know
they
use
different
barrels
but
its
the
only
other
ba
english
barleywine
ive
had
that
comes
close
to
being
as
good
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
little
fizz
poured
n2
a
red
wine
glass
it
is
a
barley
wine
right
great
smell
flavor
nice
and
smooth
not
2
sweet
like
u
expect
from
a
barley
wine
paired
it
with
perez
carrillo
la
historia
cigar
thats
spicy
im
n
flavor
heaven
will
grab
another
and
revisit
this
in
2017
overall
this
is
what
barleywine
should
be
how
did
they
get
it
so
right
sweet
carmel
notes
and
little
head
o
solid
english
barleywine
that
doesnt
really
deliver
any
of
the
red
wine
barrel
characteristics
but
if
you
like
american
barleywines
this
is
a
reasonably
hoppy
barleywine
i
think
the
english
barleywine
designation
on
this
site
is
definitely
a
misnomer
slightly
sweet
great
deal
of
flavor
and
some
effervescence
overall
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
recently
very
well
balanced
and
not
over
the
top
i
was
worried
that
the
wine
character
was
going
to
overwhelm
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
it
felt
like
a
natural
component
id
love
to
get
another
one
to
cellar
for
a
year
or
2
this
pretty
well
sums
up
the
barleywine
style
this
is
the
2014
version
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
litickers
liquor
in
san
diego
overall
excellent
base
barleywine
with
the
wine
barrel
providing
just
enough
added
uniqueness
to
make
this
stand
out
from
the
crowd
i
really
liked
this
beer
excellent
barleywine
with
light
ba
flavor
added
later
oak
flavors
coming
through
as
it
warms
extremely
well
done
overall
i
was
skeptical
about
this
for
too
long
def
worth
picking
up
a
couple
for
the
cellar
potent
english
malts
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
heavy
body
beautiful
rich
color
slightly
sour
mildly
tanniny
semisweet
coating
mouthfeel
nice
good
flavor
somewhat
sweet
with
a
wine
finish
i
did
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
other
reviewers
nice
balance
of
sweet
upfront
and
dry
winehop
finish
very
good
english
barleywine

will
update
with
2014
notes
when
consumed
overall
i
have
had
bigfoot
several
times
it
reminds
of
bigfoot
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
for
an
english
barley
wine
it
seems
a
little
too
bitter
ive
had
other
english
barley
wines
that
were
really
smoother
i
drank
it
before
the
best
after
date
dont
know
if
that
matters
but
i
was
expecting
more
wine
barrel
aromas
still
really
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
worth
a
try
and
money
3

sneakily
good
barleywine
with
a
subtle
barrel
approach
a
good
deal
of
caramel
in
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
one
it
could
use
a
little
more
substance
and
thickness
otherwise
its
pretty
good
overall
a
very
good
beer
ooverall
a
great
barleywine
would
like
to
have
a
bottle
to
age
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
im
really
glad
deschutes
is
now
distributing
in
va
o
this
is
an
english
barleywine
its
so
far
from
one
its
mind
boggling
its
pure
hops
and
its
good
with
the
bourbon
but
not
english
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
in
error
i
did
not
let
this
one
fully
open
up
before
i
started
in
on
it
but
as
it
sat
and
warmed
it
really
got
to
be
excellent
an
excellent
effort
from
deschutes
here
glad
that
they
are
in
ky
so
i
can
make
a
short
jaunt
up
to
sample
their
products
without
having
to
trade
for
them
i
cant
remember
what
i
paid
for
this
but
at
this
point
it
was
well
worth
every
penny
simply
amazing
and
very
enjoyable
eyepopping
and
palate
pleasing
to
the
hilt
chewy
and
boozy
loaded
with
strong
malt
sweetness
yet
very
fitting
for
the
style
huge
depth
and
complexity
in
the
flavor
department
and
wellbalanced
throughout
this
would
have
been
very
interesting
to
try
past
its
best
after
date
yet
delivers
a
huge
pallet
of
goodness
right
now
a
barleywine
musttry
just
an
awesome
barleywine
which
you
know
if
youve
been
lucky
enough
to
score
a
bottle
aroma
was
raisins
wine
tart
cherries
chocolate
brown
sugar
hazelnut
and
pomegranate
the
color
was
very
pretty
a
very
deep
ruby
brown
opaque
with
a
nice
beige
head
it
was
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
heavy
mouthfeel
that
left
it
sticky
the
taste
was
plums
raisins
cherries
vanilla
dark
brown
sugar
wine
chocolate
and
a
little
booze
but
its
wine
so
whatever
right
this
is
a
big
complex
barleywine
thats
just
begging
to
be
explored
and
luckily
its
delicious
so
youll
want
to
incredible
now
but
i
imagine
it
will
benefit
nicely
from
additional
aging
o
4
excellent
english
barleywine
with
some
uniqueness
with
the
wine
barrel
aging
i
wasnt
sure
how
well
it
would
meld
but
it
works
well
although
this
is
really
good
it
is
a
high
priced
bomber
and
im
not
quite
sure
it
lives
up
to
expectations
therefore
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
pours

with
a

each
other
bready
and
veering
towards

tannins
and
its
barrel
caramel
and
some
caramelized
pitted
dark
fruits
mixed
with
some
brown
sugar
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
i
really
am
not
a
barleywine
fan
but
i
had
to
give
this
a
try
given
the
rave
reviews
it
has
plusi
was
able
to
try
it
on
tap
and
didnt
have
to
commit
to
a
full
bottle
ultimately
not
really
my
thing
but
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
i
will
stick
with
firestone
walkers
sucuba
if
i
ever
have
a
craving
for
another
barleywine
at
the
least
i
prefer
the
use
of
bourbon
barrel
over
wine
barrel
when
paired
with
a
barleywine
dark
amber
body
good
amount
of
head
for
11
booze
grainy
alcohol
sweet
smell
just
got
done
with
a
cw
bbbw
and
this
one
isnt
quit
as
sweet
still
very
sweet
with
some
hoppy
fruit
flavors
easily
2nd
best
bw
ive
had
goodbeer
but
it
should
be
under
american
barleywine
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
hoppy
side
for
it
to
be
an
english
barleywine
o
well
done
here
a
stellar
english
barleywine
by
itself
but
the
addition
of
wine
barrels
brings
complexity
and
another
dimension
o
very
good
beer
but
very
rich
split
with
a
friend
finally
a
good
english
style
barley
wine
that
can
hold
up
to
what
i
am
looking
for
in
the
style

and

taste
wow
i
have
been
looking
for
you
sweet
caramel
notes
up
front
golden
raisins
and
brown
sugar
to
the
back
with
a
plum
and
brandy
like
quality
on
the
aftertaste
fantastic
nice
silk
smooth
yet
lightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
easy
drinkability
makes
this
one
beast
of
a
great
brew
cheers
i
have
finally
found
a
decent
substitute
for
thomas
hardys
reminiscent
of
some
of
the
early
90s
thomas
hardys
i
have
tried
aged
10
years
or
so
awesome
full
bodied
syrupy
feel
sticky
finish
low
carbonation
overall
really
tasty
and
smooth
for
being
11
loads
of
complex
flavor
and
the
barrel
age
wine
aspect
didnt
sour
or
bitter
this
all
to
hell
a
really
nice
beer
and
one
of
the
best
from
deschutes
a
must
try
even
if
not
a
fan
of
the
style
overall
i
say
this
was
a
great
beer
well
worth
a
superb
night
cap
would
i
have
it
again
hell
yeah
overall
very
tasty
needed
to
do
some
warming
to
get
the
wine
barrel
out
of
it
a
very
alcoholic
fruitforward
tannic
bitter
barleywine
not
hoppy
and
quite
sweet
up
front
but
has
the
alcohol
bite
in
the
back
brings
it
down
o
overall
a
hell
of
a
beer
delicious
yay
beer
o
nice
barleywine
good
combination
of
fruitiness
and
heavy
bready
malts
super
sweet
and
mildly
bitter
and
dry
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
didnt
really
get
any
noticeable
wine
influence
that
i
notice
but
i
feel
it
may
have
contributed
to
the
heavy
dark
fruit
character
up
front
anyway
o
i
love
it
phenomenal

overall
perhaps
im
rating
this
a
bit
harsh
because
of
the
best
after
date
deschutes
is
hit
and
miss
to
me
this
reminds
me
of
an
aged
stone
barleywine
with
a
bit
more
tannin
character
ive
got
one
in
the
cellar
but
disappointed
by
the
expectations
set
from
a
waxed
bottle
reddish
brown
in
color
thick
head
leaves
a
decent
lacing
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
this

have
a
great

of
variation
and
layers
of
complexity
wood
caramel
and
toffee
brown
sugar
soaked
hops
on
the
nose
a
hint
of
wine
lots
off
toffee
maltiness
and
hops
mixed
with
some
darktart
fruits
in
the
taste
wood
and
vanilla
on
the
finish
moderately
warming
hot
in
the
mouth
very
much
full
bodied
excellent
beer
overall
although
a
tad
hoppy
for
an
english
barleywine
imo
would
love
to
age
one
of
these
for
about
5
years
to
tame
the
alcohol
and
hops
a
bit
who
knows
when
ill
see
it
again
though
i
found
this
barleywine
to
be
very
enjoyable
quite
drinkable
and
a
thoroughly
pleasant
surprise
22
oz
bottle
this
a
solid
beer
all
around
it
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
with
decent
a
moderate
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
strong
grapes
followed
by
oak
and
caramel
the
taste
is
really
wellbalanced
with
grapes
at
the
beginning
followed
by
a
smooth
and
sweet
finish
this
has
a
great
texture
and
is
not
overly
thick
or
boozy
im
really
impressed
with
this
one
o
awesome
aged
barleywine
that
is
not
overpowering
with
the
aged
part
which
is
something
i
hate
when
the
aged
part
just
completely
overpowers
the
actual
beer
i
would
recommend
getting
as
much
of
this
as
you
can
find
to
age
and
enjoy
down
the
road
a
great
barleywine
and
spot
on
for
an
english
example
of
the
style
it
is
a
bit
on
the
pricy
side
but
a
great
treat
every
once
in
a
while
another
highly
recommended
offering
from
deschutes
great
contrast
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
with
lots
of
yummy
esters
to
add
interest
its
a
bit
hot
but
very
nice
deschutes
mirror
mirror

i
cant
stop
thinking
how
much
this
reminds
me
of
a
wooded
maple
pancake
breakfast
its
really
enjoyable
and
not
horrifically
sweet
to
me
either
in
many
ways
it
also
reminds
me
of
founders
curmudgeons
better
half
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
barleywine
good
bready
caramel
and
toffee
notes
with
a
nice
balanced
wine
barrel
presence
c
my
description
and
review
would
be
almost
verbatim
from
homebrew311
below
me
except
my
ratings
are
a
little
higher
i
am
not
a
wine
person
but
the
red
wine
barrel
works
really
well
in
balancing
this
beer
very
sweet
and
malt
driven
with
a
nice
tartness
the
only
knock
on
it
would
be
that
it
had
a
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
bite
or
finish
for
an
english
style
in
fairness
it
does
have
a
best
after
date
on
it
that
should
take
care
of
the
very
slight
bitterness
it
is
a
fantastic
version
of
the
style
though
completely
enjoyable
from
day
1
cant
wait
to
try
the
others
in
12
and
3
year
increments
this
comes
in
just
behind
goose
island
bourbon
county
along
with
billionaire
for
the
best
ba
english
so
far
15
each
is
what
i
paid
for
this
o
4
25
this
is
a
very
good
english
barleywine
with
a
lot
of
good
flavors
and
aromas
there
could
be
a
bit
less
hops
in
my
opinion
but
maybe
in
a
year
or
two
it
will
mellow
out
and
be
more
balanced
the
bottle
does
recommend
drinking
after
22415
hopefully
it
will
improve
with
age
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
tawnyreddishamber
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
an
absolute
malt
bomb
you
get
plenty
of
the
expected
notes
from
a
big
english
barleywine
including
bread
raisins
toffee
caramel
molasses
and
a
hint
of
red
wine
sneaks
through
in
the
background
the
hops
are
tame
in
this
as
they
really
allow
the
big
sweet
malts
shine
a
touch
of
oak
is
present
as
well
the
taste
is
malt
forward
and
sweet
with
an
emphasis
on
the
caramel
molasses
and
dark
fruit
character
the
red
wine
character
seems
to
tie
this
beer
together
as
it
adds
a
hint
of
acidity
and
tames
down
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
fully
bodied
and
low
in
the
carbonation
department
overall
a
very
nice
barleywine
o
wonderful
barley
wine
this
one
is
in
my
top
5
for
the
group
too
bad
deschutes
doesnt
distribute
in
alabama
good
barleywine
with
tempered
sweetness
and
a
balance
of
smooth
and
bitter
overall
a
truly
excellent
barrel
aged
bw
and
one
im
glad
i
splurged
on
however
with
a
big
and
boozy
in
a
good
way
beer
like
this
i
find
myself
wishing
it
was
30
degrees
colder
outside
and
snowing
while
i
sip
it
by
the
fire
guess
ill
have
to
track
down
another
bottle
and
set
it
aside
for
next
winter
overall
just
a
wonderful
ba
barleywine
and
the
use
of
wine
barrels
makes
for
a
completely
different
take
on
the
style
i
have
yet
to
sample
the
fw
barleywine
of
barrelaged
fame
but
if
its
better
than
this
fantastic
take
im
going
to
be
in
for
a
treat
i
have
another
couple
bottles
and
will
really
enjoy
seeing
how
this
one
evolves
with
some
age
overall
its
good
16
good
i
dont
think
so
its
doubtful
id
buy
it
again
not
even
for
aging
though
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
there
are
few
brews
in
the
world
worth
that
price
this
simply
isnt
one
of
them
i
was
a
bit
confused
by
this
beer
it
is
classified
as
an
english
barleywine
but
the
hop
profile
reminds
me
of
an
american
barleywine
i
appreciated
the
nice
almost
ruby
red
beer
as
it
sat
in
my
tulip
the
beer
had
a
very
malty
entry
lots
of
intense
plummy
raisiny
fruitiness
immediately
following
upon
entering
the
palate
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
i
also
appreciated
how
well
the
alcohol
was
masked
it
was
only
after
sipping
for
a
while
that
i
felt
the
overall
warming
effects
of
this
11
brew
i
enjoyed
the
cooked
caramel
molasses
dark
chocolate
and
grainybready
flavors
that
swirled
along
my
palate
the
hops
threw
me
off
for
an
english
bwine
i
was
expecting
a
more
toned
down
english
noble
hop
profile
instead
what
i
perceived
was
a
big
citrus
notes
along
with
and
welcomed
spicy
earthiness
from
the
hops
the
hops
reminded
me
more
of
an
american
bwine
the
hops
were
more
bitey
as
the
beer
warmed
the
big
citrus
hoppiness
overpowered
any
wine
nuances
that
were
supposed
to
be
evident
i
love
lightly
carbonated
beers
which
is
what
this
beer
is
i
would
also
prefer
a
fuller
bodied
beer
this
beer
was
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
me
i
have
a
second
bottle
i
will
retry
in
a
year
or
so
the
hoppiness
should
be
more
mellow
by
then
this
is
a
solid
bwine
its
not
as
great
as
the
hype
would
have
you
believe
i
love
all
bwines
if
you
do
as
well
this
is
a
must
try
o
a
good
barrel
aged
barleywine
a
very
pleasant
brew
very
balanced
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
after
some
time
edit
from
20
minutes
later
tastes
really
good
when
it
gets
a
little
warm
well
this
is
just
a
deliciously
distinctive
draught
without
a
doubt
o
a
little
harsh
for
an
english
barely
wine
drinkable
but
not
up
to
the
level
of
hype
that
it
has
received
for
something
aged
in
wine
barrels
the
wine
character
is
lost
amongst
the
hops
might
as
well
use
bourbon
barrels
o
not
my
thing
but
this
is
how
this
beer
should
taste
i
feel
like
i
just
ate
a
fig
newton
followed
by
a
snickers
bar
fantastic
this
was
a
very
good
barley
wine
i
purchased
two
bottles
of
this
one
to
try
now
and
one
to
age
after
the
best
after
date
of
22515
it
will
be
hard
to
keep
this
bottle
to
find
out
how
well
it
ages
it
is
a
very
smooth
sipping
beer
with
just
a
touch
of
the
wine
barrel
notes
in
the
after
taste
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
with
a
nice
change
up
of
wine
barrel
aging
instead
of
the
standard
bourbon
complex
flavors
this
is
my
2nd
bottle
the
first
i
drank
fresh
and
enjoyed
but
i
see
definite
improvement
in
this
2nd
bottle
which
has
been
aged
not
quite
a
year
and
was
opened
about
1
week
past
the
best
after
date
i
have
a
3rd
bottle
which
i
look
forward
to
in
the
future
o
wellexecuted
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
englishstyle
barleywines
ive
tasted
great
stuff
o
this
is
an
incredible
barleywine
the
only
thing
id
change
is
the
mouthfeel
4
5
been
waiting
about
4
years
now
to
try
this
bad
boy
overall
a
nice
barleywine
but
rather
looking
forward
to
an
wellaged
version
to
round
out
the
hop
bitter
edges
guessing
this
will
shine
like
fine
port
at
around
its
peak
overall
this
is
such
an
amazing
beer
im
so
glad
deschutes
brought
it
back
as
far
as
english
barley
wines
go
this
is
near
if
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
it
is
up
there
with
fw
sucaba
my
oh
my
this
has
been
one
of
my
white
whales
for
this
brewery
the
abyss
having
slipped
thorough
my
fingers
too
many
times
as
well
and
now
i
have
it
memories
of
sitting
in
front
of
the
mirror
pond
in
bend
on
a
sunday
evening
on
another
brewerys
patio
are
now
eclipsed
by
the
headiness
of
this
offering
for
a
westcoast
bred
brew
of
the
given
style
i
am
surprised
at
the
accuracy
if
not
the
veracity
of
the
aplomb
evident
here
i
bristle
at
calling
this
young
seeming
since
i
was
admonished
at
first
from
even
going
down
that
road
oh
well
this
is
still
freaking
awesome
very
nice
barley
wine
here
the
oak
notes
are
plentiful
on
the
taste
which
is
great
i
bought
2
bottles
and
am
excited
to
see
how
it
does
with
age
overall
this
exemplifies
the
art
of
brewing
wanna
be
a
master
at
something
drink
beer
then
drink
this
and
youll
see
what
level
im
talking
about
needless
to
say
this
is
a
musttry
before
you
die
looked
great
poured
into
a
teku
smelled
similar
to
other
ba
barley
wines
tasted
ok
a
bad
representation
of
something
like
firestone
walkers
sucaba
very
thin
for
something
barrel
aged
might
be
a
lot
better
with
a
couple
years
on
it
i
have
a
few
more
and
will
review
again
each
year
highly
disappointed
by
this
beer
overall
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
intense
with
delicate
flavor
notes
if
it
lacks
anything
it
would
be
an
aroma
as
distinctive
as
the
flavor
id
love
to
see
what
proper
aging
brings
out
in
this
one
i
suspect
it
only
gets
better
with
a
few
years
in
a
cool
cellar
overall
another
stellar
offering
by
deschutes
my
gripe
with
their
reserve
line
of
beers
lately
has
been
that
they
pretty
much
limit
the
barrel
aging
to
about
50
of
the
beer
yet
the
price
reflects
a
100
barrel
aged
beer
i
dont
necessarily
think
they
are
doing
it
to
produce
a
lesser
quality
product
but
it
certainly
helps
profits
yet
the
5050
ratio
is
pretty
clever
in
that
it
avoids
heavy
barrel
presence
which
can
be
cloying
if
overdone
but
maintains
a
great
level
of
complexity
otherwise
maybe
not
achieved
through
standard
nonbarrel
aging
practices
o
a
good
beer
overall
id
like
a
little
more
presence
from
the
barrels
but
its
enjoyable
and
quite
srinkable
for
a
barrelaged
barleywine
not
true
in
this
case
it
was
ok
at
best
this
is
my
first
deschutes
that
has
been
a
disappointment
after
seeing
deschutes
had
a
new
barleywine
out
i
went
digging
for
this
and
was
not
disappointed
this
bottle
was
slightly
oxidized
but
not
enough
to
detract
much
very
nice
overall
this
was
great
bottle
says
to
enjoy
after
42010
so
im
almost
2
years
past
that
point
and
the
flavors
really
melded
together
o
milder
ba
barleywine
has
nice
sweet
malts
and
dark
fruit
notes
o
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
find
it
in
the
store
buy
it
i
doubt
its
out
there
any
more
though
ive
heard
theyre
going
to
release
it
again
i
dont
know
if
the
guy
who
shared
this
with
me
is
on
beeradvocate
but
larry
if
youre
reading
this
thank
you
sooo
much
this
is
a
great
beer
o
pretty
sweet
on
the
palate
but
a
solid
flavorful
and
creamy
barleywine
that
i
would
gladly
visit
again
muddled
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
loose
offwhite
head
caramel
sweetness
wine
barrel
in
the
nose
noticeable
hoppy
bitterness
with
vinous
flavors
cutting
through
the
beers
barley
sweetness
full
bodied
sweet
well
carbonated
subtle
wine
barrel
and
a
slightly
offputting
bitterness
in
the
finish
would
recommend
letting
this
batch
hangout
for
a
bit
hop
profile
is
too
much
at
the
moment
many
thanks
to
cosmicevan
for
sending
this
bottle
my
way
enjoyable
and
interesting
stuff
o
pretty
good
but
i
remembering
this
being
quite
a
bit
better
about
a
year
ago
its
a
bit
harsher
and
less
barrely
overall
i
am
both
happy
and
sad
that
we
drank
this
beer
we
drank
one
of
these
around
2
years
ago
and
to
be
honest
i
dont
remember
exactly
what
it
tasted
like
then
so
if
this
bottle
does
have
an
infection
issue
that
lead
to
the
tartness
i
described
above
then
so
be
it
as
a
whole
i
really
dont
taste
or
smell
or
see
any
signs
of
infection
and
i
am
really
enjoying
this
fantastic
beer
i
believe
this
bottle
is
around
3
years
old
and
it
is
drinking
great
i
am
sad
because
this
was
the
last
bottle
i
had
and
since
i
dont
think
it
is
infected
i
could
have
saved
it
a
little
longer
but
when
would
be
a
better
time
to
crack
it
than
this
cool
monsoon
evening
in
payson
az
pours
amber
with
some
creamy
foam
atop
smells
of
nougat
vanilla
caramel
and
toasted
sugars
flavor
is
nicely
rounded
with
sweet
malts
toffee
caramel
brown
sugar
and
nougat
with
a
good
hint
of
bitterness
to
complement
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carb
and
slick
finish
really
like
how
this
one
has
matured
o
to
their
credit
deschutes
sent
me
a
very
nice
handwritten
note
explaining
the
infection
issues
and
apologizing
they
also
reimbursed
me
for
the
bottle
they
definitely
were
on
top
of
their
game
in
solving
customer
service
issues
related
to
the
infection
that
said
i
would
never
trade
for
the
2009
vintage
again
overall
see
above
not
too
bad
even
with
the
infection
but
could
be
sooo
much
better
que
sera
sera
better
luck
next
time
i
guess
o
really
well
balanced
barley
wine
3
years
was
definitely
a
nice
age
but
i
am
sad
i
dont
have
anymore
bottles
ill
be
sure
to
grab
a
couple
bottles
next
time
deschutes
releases
this
highly
recommended
thanks
again
scott
o
the
infection
killed
what
would
have
abviously
been
a
great
brew
i
would
have
loved
to
review
this
without
having
this
issue
but
i
cannot
get
myself
to
track
another
bottle
down
drain
pour
o
deschutes
doing
it
again
glad
this
one
wasnt
infected
like
some
others
delicious
easy
drinking
barley
wine
that
ages
wonderfully
o
ive
liked
most
deschutes
products
ive
tried
in
my
life
but
this
was
a
big
disappointment
boring
even
i
guess
if
sugar
cubes
infused
with
pure
grain
alcohol
is
your
thing
then
knock
yourself
out
o
i
had
this
shortly
after
release
and
was
able
to
find
this
bottle
now
nearly
2
12
years
later
age
did
well
on
this
very
complex
and
solid
barleywine
o
this
is
a
very
good
very
complex
barleywine
style
ale
nice
subtleties
amidst
some
strong
characteristics
not
sure
what
the
deet
flavorsmell
is
going
on
but
overall
its
good
highly
recommend
d
i
was
really
worried
this
would
be
infected
like
my
09
abyss
so
i
waited
a
couple
years
to
open
it
now
i
wish
i
had
tried
it
fresh
however
it
was
pretty
delicious
after
2
5
years
anyway
id
place
it
somewhere
between
old
ruffian
and
gratitude
or
call
it
a
caramel
mimosa
great
scent
and
taste
with
solid
body
alcohol
in
finish
made
it
more
of
a
sipper
but
a
very
enjoyable
one
at
that
so
curious
how
this
was
fresh
but
lovely
now
could
maybe
age
longer
im
so
happy
this
wasnt
spoiled
becomes
more
sweet
as
it
warms
up
pours
a
cloudy
dark
ruddy
amber
lots
of
fine
particles
noted
in
the
bottom
of
my
glass
thankfully
no
large
chunks
a
small
sheet
of
lace
tops
it
off
the
nose
is
rich
with
molasses
dark
fruits
light
booze
character
wet
wood
very
nice
aroma
the
body
has
not
been
hurt
by
time
in
the
cellar
at
all
this
one
is
hefty
and
filling
carbonation
level
is
moderate
tasty
beer
with
fig
plum
faint
vanilla
toffee
excellent
beer
the
flavors
meld
so
well
together
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
agedbarleywines
i
have
had
to
those
that
are
still
sitting
on
some
of
these
the
forecast
looks
good
overall
an
interesting
and
complex
barleywine
i
was
able
to
have
this
on
tap
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
at
a
local
bar
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
good
or
this
complex
that
said
i
also
dont
think
this
is
the
gold
standard
of
all
the
barleywines
ive
had
and
for
being
a
partially
barrel
aged
barleywine
i
think
i
expected
a
little
bit
more
of
a
barrel
appearance
take
if
for
what
its
worth
overall
impression
like
the
abyss
i
recommend
sharing
this
with
a
friend
or
anyone
for
this
matter
very
strong
and
put
me
under
the
table
enjoyed
thoroughly
and
while
never
seeing
this
before
had
to
order
i
am
very
lucky
i
had
such
good
luck
finding
a
2009
reserve
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
amazingly
crafted
barley
wine
its
so
drinkable
even
at
this
high
an
abv
i
found
myself
enjoying
the
entire
bottle
by
myself
throughout
the
course
of
the
night
i
regret
not
trying
it
fresh
to
see
what
the
age
did
to
it
i
was
hugely
turned
off
of
barley
wines
at
that
time
though
im
loving
this
barleywine
great
stuff
the
body
is
smooth
with
soft
carbonation
a
little
bit
on
the
sticky
side
overall
this
one
is
drinking
like
a
champ
a
little
hoppier
than
i
had
imagined
it
to
be
but
this
is
a
real
treat
m
very
drinkable
wellrounded
beer
slight
cloying
and
aging
with
2
years
on
it
the
beer
is
copperorange
hued
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
leaves
sparse
lacing
on
the
tulip
the
aroma
offers
brettanomyces
alcohol
oak
vanilla
and
candied
malt
the
beer
is
just
ok
and
unorthodox
for
the
style
an
odd
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
i
dont
dislike
the
beer
per
se
but
this
hardly
resembles
a
barleywine
of
any
sort
deschutes
needs
to
fix
these
quality
control
issues
and
stop
releasing
infected
beers
overall
a
seemingly
average
barleywine
which
i
do
not
think
improved
with
cellaring
d
very
drinkable
i
really
like
the
richness
of
the
brown
sugar
and
malts
alongside
the
barrel
elements
the
light
dark
fruit
actually
works
well
o
highly
recommended
barleywine
description
says
that
it
is
english
i
would
float
this
one
more
towards
american
due
to
the
citruslike
character
do
not
expect
hops
like
a
great
divide
old
ruffian
think
more
like
green
flashs
barleywine
big
malt
character
vanilla
and
lingering
bourbon
provide
a
myriad
of
flavors
this
is
a
reflection
beer
expect
to
block
some
time
out
for
this
one
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
sipping
beer
rich
complex
and
delicious
glad
ive
got
one
more
to
cellar
for
a
while
overall
pretty
damn
great
you
gotta
love
a
sweet
beer
though
i
wish
i
would
have
had
one
fresh
too
i
dont
think
this
one
needs
any
more
age
its
smoothed
out
quite
a
bit
i
assume
o
awesome
i
love
a
good
english
bw
and
this
one
takes
the
cake
for
sure
little
oxidized
but
what
do
you
expect
from
a
6
year
old
beer
big
malts
smooth
alcohol
is
nice
bitterness
isnt
tongue
scraping
oakiness
is
present
but
not
dominant
another
score
for
deschutes
o
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
the
barrels
have
smoothed
this
one
out
and
yet
the
oak
remains
subtle
and
pleasing
cheers
to
deschutes
for
such
a
remarkable
brew
i
want
to
try
a
bottle
as
they
intended
because
i
can
see
this
being
a
great
beer
take
a
shot
at
it
if
you
can
if
you
like
funk
you
wont
be
disappointed
either
way
well
done
deschutes
really
pleased
i
got
to
try
this
beer
not
infected
or
at
least
kept
refrigerated
long
enough
to
keep
the
infection
at
bay
very
nice
treat
great
balance
of
age
for
this
one
and
would
love
to
get
another
non
infected
bottle
of
this
one
had
this
one
aging
for
two
years
and
finally
tried
it
pours
a
redbrown
with
a
quarter
inch
of
head
smells
fruity
and
a
little
bit
sour
tastes
fruity
like
a
barleywine
should
but
as
i
work
my
way
through
it
it
loses
complexity
and
turns
out
to
be
unremarkable
carbonation
is
fine
but
this
is
nothing
special
especially
for
the
13
a
bottle
i
paid
for
it
o
good
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
even
at
11
has
aged
just
fine
and
i
can
see
this
getting
even
better
over
the
next
two
years
would
drink
again
overall
very
impressed
with
this
offering
and
i
wish
the
tabc
would
approve
the
labels
so
we
could
get
it
in
texas
pours
medium
copper
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
big
malts
upfront
with
some
oak
and
fig
and
rasin
scents
a
small
amount
of
piney
hops
taste
is
amazing
sweet
caramel
and
oak
flavors
with
some
amazing
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
perfect
for
the
style
overall
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
big
shoutout
to
g311
for
hooking
me
up
with
his
last
bottle
of
this
thanks
vince
it
seems
with
the
sour
apple
notes
this
one
may
have
had
an
inkling
of
the
infection
but
it
hadnt
taken
over
and
dominated
yet
it
was
still
very
well
received
and
had
i
known
no
better
i
would
have
assumed
the
apple
was
intentional
o
it
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
ever
had
over
two
year
and
a
half
years
it
has
gained
a
lot
of
sweet
barley
and
caramel
with
a
bunch
of
dark
fruit
it
is
an
amazing
barleywine
it
is
not
infected
whatsoever
flavor
balance
if
you
are
tempted
to
say
you
dont
like
barleywines
i
recommend
letting
this
one
sit
a
good
45
minutes
before
your
first
sip
the
flavor
changes
dramatically
as
it
warms
this
brew
is
totally
unique
its
like
celebrator
meets
rodenbach
grand
cru
meets
pliny
the
elder
the
cacophonous
hoppysour
tones
ricochet
around
your
mouth
and
tongue
but
the
oak
intervenes
just
in
time
to
develop
a
deliciously
balanced
melody
the
flavors
are
ever
evolving
mimicking
its
aromas
and
adding
cider
oats
nuts
belgian
malt
and
slight
cocoa
powder
quite
outstanding
i
want
more
my
attitude
toward
barleywine
has
changed
lately
and
this
beer
really
helped
change
my
mind
along
with
hair
of
the
dogs
fred
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
from
someone
wellknown
as
deschutes
brewery
pours
a
hazy
honey
orangebrown
with
a
1
inch
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
broken
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
apricot
peach
and
citrus
juices
and
citrus
zests
very
nice
smells
on
this
one
taste
is
of
brown
sugar
carameltoffee
apricotpeach
and
sweetened
citrus
juices
surprisingly
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
with
more
of
an
acidic
citrus
juice
quality
than
any
real
hop
bitterness
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
with
some
very
nice
and
complex
smells
and
flavors
after
perhaps
2
or
so
years
in
the
bottle
this
has
aged
wonderfully
a
solid
barleywine
but
not
at
all
what
i
expected
for
the
style
tastes
almost
like
an
aged
iipa
with
all
the
citrus
and
cane
sugar
notes
that
come
to
the
forefront
nice
but
it
doesnt
have
the
flavor
profile
that
i
want
from
a
barleywine
t
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
but
im
not
sure
its
really
doing
it
for
me
oak
plum
and
some
port
with
a
heavy
oak
finish
some
caramel
malts
as
well
on
the
end
a
solid
beer
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
deschutes
o
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
much
for
a
85
degree
day
in
portland
should
continue
to
age
gracefully
through
the
years
hopefully
without
infection
i
think
this
needs
more
aging
beer
is
thin
and
burns
on
the
back
of
the
palate
very
tart
on
the
back
end
and
vinegar
throughout
shame
on
you
deschutes
oafter
having
mixed
experiences
with
barleywines
i
was
a
little
worried
fresh
dfh
olde
school
was
a
turn
off
the
two
years
of
age
made
this
one
great
well
balanced
a
great
choice
for
the
4th
of
july
narrative
yeah
yeah
more
bagpipes
on
the
secondary
add
in
the
deadmaus
sample
then
crescendo
to
a
165
bpm
then
cut
it
with
classical
guitar
on
the
close
in
the
european
scene
dj
venestraus
was
the
hottest
thing
to
hit
trilingual
audiences
it
was
a
series
of
cacophonous
pangs
and
knocks
that
seemed
to
ebb
and
flow
without
any
rhyme
or
reason
yeah
just
like
that
now
extend
into
the
1700
mark
with
goat
bleating
for
a
solid
4
minutes
of
flanger
pedal
the
studio
techs
never
questioned
his
genius
and
the
underground
media
just
assumed
that
his
works
would
appreciate
with
age
however
even
the
most
remotely
old
works
still
were
incomprehensible
to
music
discographers
alright
and
when
i
ask
for
syncopated
plate
and
knife
scratching
at
least
try
and
get
resonant
bleeks
the
studio
tech
shrugged
and
added
more
autotune
to
mic4
my
initial
impression
of
this
beer
two
years
ago
was
this
needs
time
nothing
has
changed
this
beer
seems
to
have
remained
static
and
neither
improved
nor
regressed
as
is
this
isnt
a
great
barleywine
you
get
a
little
of
the
oak
slightly
smokey
this
brew
would
go
excellent
with
a
chorizo
sausage
some
pickles
and
strong
cheddar
drink
this
beer
at
a
lighthouse
with
a
pairing
knife
a
red
onion
and
some
rye
bread
while
a
storm
is
blowing
in
this
is
a
goddamn
good
ale
enjoy
get
me
a
pastrami
on
rye
and
some
dijon
mustard
stat
quite
simply
an
outstanding
barley
wine
and
part
of
deschutes
reserve
series
aged
in
oak
barrels
mirror
mirror
is
actually
a
doubled

version
of
their
mirror
pond
pale
ale
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
and
theres
notes
of
sweet
caramel
and
vanilla
in
the
nose
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
as
the
sweet
caramel
and
vanilla
are
complimented
by
dark
fruit
and
cascade
hops
with
a
bourbon
like
backbone
from
the
oak
barrels
mirror
mirror
has
a
warming
almost
candy
like
feel
to
it
as
well
and
goes
down
quite
smoothly
for
a

closer
to
an
american
barleywine
than
an
english
barelywine
in
my
opinion
due
to
the
assertiveness
of
the
hops
character
decent
but
not
earth
shattering
however
much
better
than
the
infected
version
a
sweet
delicious
complex
interesting
sipper
a
real
treat
i
wish
i
had
bottles
and
bottles
of
thisthis
beer
seems
like
it
needs
exploring
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
a
nice
bit
of
white
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
while
smells
mildly
hoppy
with
a
significant
booziness
on
the
nose
a
great
aroma
but
smells
a
bit
harsh
tastes
dry
and
strongly
boozy
the
hops
are
subtle
but
very
solid
this
beer
needs
even
more
time
i
think
pretty
darn
solid
though
overall
solid
overall
but
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
o
this
was
a
real
treat
no
signs
of
infection
that
i
noticed
im
surprised
i
was
able
to
still
find
a
few
bottles
on
the
shelves
i
will
definitely
have
more
bottles
of
this
in
the
near
future
nonblind
comments
heh
i
really
thought
this
was
a
wild
ale
of
some
sort
apparently
i
was
yet
another
victim
of
brett
infection
but
the
unintentional
sour
ended
up
being
pleasant
id
still
like
to
try
unadulterated
mirror
mirror
though
definetly
not
infected
yeah
an
amberredorange
which
is
slightly
transparent
a
nice
tight
head
appears
and
then
retreats
but
some
carb
always
stays
afloat
when
i
sip
some
lacing
is
left
behind
a
very
fruity
and
sticky
hop
aroma
some
cherry
and
sappy
pine
with
caramalized
english
malts
strong
caramalized
malts
fruity
sappy
hops
bitter
across
the
midpalate
just
a
hint
of
barrel
towards
the
finish
little
bit
sticky
with
some
honey
on
the
finish
in
the
end
this
is
awesome
but
could
use
just
a
bit
more
barrel
although
i
appreciate
the
intricate
nature
of
this
beer
d
actually
was
drinking
wonderful
and
enjoyed
it
by
a
bonfire
next
to
lake
casitas
during
homebrew
fest
good
shit
this
beer
pours
an
orange
body
very
light
foam
on
the
head
this
beer
smells
as
if
some
brett
funk
has
gotten
into
it
there
is
some
clementine
on
the
nose
as
well
but
the
musty
brett
smell
is
actually
working
pretty
well
with
this
beer
the
taste
has
brett
in
it
but
it
comes
out
like
a
caramelized
saison
i
rather
enjoy
the
level
of
funk
that
comes
with
this
beer
i
thought
that
it
meant
that
i
wouldnt
enjoy
it
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
mistake
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
if
i
could
be
promised
this
level
of
brett
in
the
beer
to
which
i
found
much
delight
o
fantastic
that
sums
it
up
rather
well
overall
this
beer
is
a
gem
i
have
patiently
waited
for
some
time
it
was
well
worth
it
this
bottle
was
definitely
not
infected
with
brett
as
others
have
reported
infected
rating

overall
yet
another
deschutes
disaster
i
look
forward
to
deschutes
hopefully
turning
it
around
this
year
with
the
black
butte
xxiii
release
o
awesome
looks
great
tastes
great
and
feels
even
better
there
might
be
a
little
funk
in
here
but
im
really
glad
i
kept
this
one
wouldnt
mind
more
of
this
to
let
sit
i
know
this
isnt
the
beer
that
deschutes
envisioned
but
it
turned
out
pretty
good
the
sourness
and
the
hop
bitterness
are
almost
in
a
battle
with
each
other
and
the
other
flavors
fill
in
the
holes
it
would
be
nice
to
see
a
brewery
attempt
a
sour
barley
wine
i
will
resist
the
urge
to
make
the
snow
white
reference
here
but
not
the
urge
to
mention
it
so
there
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
murky
rubyamber
topped
by
about
a
halffinger
or
so
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
vague
horse
blanket
brett
ruby
reg
grapefruit
orange
zest
and
a
healthy
dose
of
caramel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
brett
now
more
spiderwebby
than
horse
blankety
orange
flesh
mashed
potatoes
parsley
and
caramel
gotta
say
this
was
not
a
very
pleasant
flavor
combination
here
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
i
was
in
no
way
impressed
with
this
brew
it
wasnt
entirely
bad
per
se
but
i
do
not
feel
like
partaking
again
in
the
near
future
shared
during
a
small
charlotte
ba
tasting
with
marine1975
cassino
carolinakevin
and
gehenherzog
i
picked
this
one
up
while
out
in
cali
for
the
bruery
rs
party
so
i
have
to
thank
womencantsail
for
shipping
it
over
to
me
2009
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
cigar
city
snifter
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wood
and
a
sour
note
uh
oh
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
slight
sour
at
least
it
was
only
slight
wood
and
peat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
okay
but
it
definitely
had
some
sort
of
infection
in
it
the
sour
aspect
did
fade
slightly
upon
warming
up
but
was
definitely
still
present
the
aroma
and
flavors
were
decent
but
definitely
not
aweinspiring
would
love
to
try
one
that
isnt
infectedoff
in
the
future
for
comparison
drinking
this
was
like
eating
a
meal
when
i
had
it
it
was
the
best
barleywine
i
had
ever
had
currently
it
is
still
at
the
top
of
that
list
its
complex
and
extremely
heavy
but
all
of
the
flavors
work
well
together
o
overall
in
the
handful
of
deschutes
beers
that
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
sample
i
have
noticed
a
consistent
vanilla
caramel
twist
or
flavor
on
everything
that
they
do
and
i
dig
it
it
adds
a
nice
touch
of
class
to
the
beer
and
is
a
flavor
that
is
very
pleasant
to
me
mirror
mirror
is
another
beer
to
solidify
my
thoughts
that
deschutes
is
a
world
class
brewery
every
beer
wreaks
of
quality
this
is
a
fantastic
barleywine
and
it
is
nice
to
taste
a
barleywine
with
a
big
vanilla
and
oak
dominance
another
winner
overall
one
of
the
better
barley
wines
out
there
great
balance
well
masked
heat
and
layered
flavors
notes
it
has
cellared
well
and
looks
as
though
it
will
continue
too
glad
i
still
have
another
bottle
d
drinkability
is
impressive
given
the
abv
and
obvious
infection
expectations
were
on
the
low
side
and
i
must
say
im
shocked
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
brew
at
11
its
a
one
and
done
beer
id
definitely
give
this
another
try
though
i
think
deschutes
is
onto
something
here
even
though
it
wasnt
intentional
barrel
aged
wild
barleywine
d
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
the
flavors
are
extremely
well
balanced
while
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
outside
of
the
warmth
it
brings
to
the
body
the
aging
made
for
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
nightcap
i
regret
not
jumping
on
this
bottle
earlier
but
i
must
say
that
its
impressive
for
an
infected
beer
the
funky
flavor
works
surprisingly
well
with
the
english
barleywine
elements
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
noninfected
bottle
for
comparison
speaking
for
this
infected
release
dont
shy
away
from
it
its
surprisingly
good
even
though
mirror
mirror
reserve
2009
doesnt
rise
the
stratospheric
heights
of
their
finest
ales
deschutes
has
done
a
great
job
with
this
primarily
palemalted
american
barleywine
heres
hoping
reserve
2012
is
in
the
works
at
this
very
moment
this
beer
would
have
been
amazing
but
the
slight
oxidization
leaves
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
is
slightly
metallicsourcardboard
like
it
is
very
faint
right
now
but
i
can
see
this
beer
becoming
awful
if
it
develops
much
further
its
only
slightly
evident
up
front
but
as
i
go
through
the
bomber
the
aftertaste
becomes
more
displeasing
considering
its
faults
this
beer
still
tastes
pretty
good
but
i
would
recommend
drinking
your
09s
sooner
rather
than
later
d
solid
allaround
though
maybe
i
cracked
this
a
little
too
soon
fearing
the
worst
the
flavors
and
especially
scents
are
still
a
bit
muddled
and
struggling
to
be
noticed
tis
a
sipper
for
sure
but
a
very
special
tasty
one
heaps
of
complexity
pretty
well
balanced
im
glad
ive
got
a
few
of
this
batch
aging
d
adequate
carbonation
make
this
pretty
drinkable
for
a
slower
drinking
style
i
had
no
problem
finishing
a
bomber
and
would
have
had
no
problem
polishing
off
another
the
being
said
i
think
people
are
attributing
the
wine
barrelaging
characteristics
to
infection
when
its
actually
intended
by
the
brewers
brett
infection
will
lead
to
overcarbonation
and
gushing
as
the
brettanomyces
converts
residual
sugars
to
co2
as
well
as
offflavors
bandaids
horse
cheese
and
a
thinned
out
body
none
of
those
were
observed
here
i
cracked
this
one
the
very
same
day
i
found
out
about
a
possible
infection
i
couldnt
detect
anything
that
would
be
indicative
of
any
sourness
this
dark
red
to
brownish
beer
has
a
decent
sized
head
on
it
that
dissipated
after
a
few
minutes
the
nose
and
taste
go
hand
in
hand
or
i
guess
it
would
be
mouth
and
nose
lots
of
sweetness
on
both
the
nose
and
palate
with
candied
sugar
hanging
out
at
the
back
dark
fruits
vanilla
and
distinct
woodiness
to
it
lends
to
a
nice
strong
mouthfeel
you
almost
feel
like
you
have
to
work
at
this
beer
like
it
is
challenging
you
to
conquer
it
awesome
beer
cant
really
say
much
else
while
it
seems
a
tad
thin
at
times
considering
its
been
conditioning
and
attenuating
for
sometime
now
its
just
fine
some
tannic
notes
are
felt
that
might
be
lent
by
oak
good
and
cleansing
and
never
harsh
very
easy
and
nice
drinking
ale
for
its
magnitude
and
in
general
it
would
suck
to
have
missed
its
glory
because
of
infection
issues
i
cant
say
what
age
could
do
to
it
but
because
deschutes
has
acknowledged
infection
i
suggest
drink
it
now
d
i
feel
like
this
could
verge
on
the
sticky
sweet
hop
mess
type
barleywines
but
then
the
oak
comes
in
and
rounds
it
out
perfectly
very
nice
while
the
beer
has
definite
flaws
i
cant
say
im
disappointed
by
my
first
taste
of
deschutes
beer
despite
how
hung
up
i
am
on
the
aftertaste
theres
really
tons
of
beautiful
flavor
here
a
mostly
great
mouthfeel
and
a
world
class
aroma
its
obvious
that
these
guys
know
how
to
make
good
stuff
and
im
even
more
excited
to
try
my
bottle
of
abyss
ive
had
this
vintage
before
approximately
a
year
ago
and
thought
it
simply
good
the
flavors
have
since
become
richer
more
pronounced
and
more
complex
a
huge
improvement
from
average
to
delicious
the
finish
was
still
a
bit
too
dry
for
me
i
was
hoping
for
a
fruitier
sweeter
backend
but
i
think
the
bottle
couldve
used
another
year
or
two
of
age
on
it
that
being
said
its
a
solid
barleywine
and
a
joy
to
drink
however
if
youve
got
some
laying
around
still
i
would
recommend
keeping
it
in
the
cellar
for
awhile
longer
easy
drinking
and
bordering
a
barleywineold
ale
blend
not
enough
thick
caramel
to
make
it
a
straight
up
bwine
hides
its
abv
superbly
brown
sugar
and
malt
heavy
character
raisins
and
earth
hints
of
fruits
not
overly
thick
body
not
sticky
and
theres
a
nice
light
hop
bite
in
the
finish
to
cut
the
sweetness
easy
drinking
the
years
have
done
it
well
and
it
drinks
like
a
charm
aside
from
the
hop
varieties
little
to
label
this
as
american
more
akin
to
its
english
brethren
skål
drink
a
very
good
beer
i
loved
it
drink
it
if
you
can
find
it
a
4
5
only
because
not
everyone
will
get
to
try
it
d
had
this
fresh
and
it
was
way
too
hot
this
is
a
completely
different
beer
that
has
aged
incredibly
well
similar
to
an
old
ale
just
a
great
beer
all
around
if
youre
aging
one
youre
still
safe
to
sit
on
it
for
a
while
but
man
is
it
drinking
great
right
now
2009
vintage
bomber
appearance
muddy
orangetangerine
minimal

close

nose
vinous
almost
kind
of

a
truly
odd
nose
to
this
beer
wet
funky
wood
taste
sweet

followed
by
that
same
odd
funk
not
infected
but
the
astrigency
from
the

interplay
strangely
with
the
very
sweet
malts
finish
is
bitter
and
boozy
with
hop
bitterness
coming
through
in
the
end
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
not
great
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
beer
perhaps
one
to
drink
fresh
and
not
cellar
wonderful
flavors
and
one
of
the
easiestdrinking
barleywines
ive
sampled
two
more
bottles
remain
in
the
cellar
and
it
will
be
hard
to
ignore
them
truly
phenomenal
its
an
american
barleywine
that
smells
like
an
english
barleywine
and
tastes
like
an
english
old
ale
all
you
need
to
know
is
that
its
worth
every
cent
cheers
eric
d
while
tasty
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
this
one
all
the
time
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
stouts
or
porters
i
typically
drink
dpretty
heavy
and
i
am
guessing
pretty
high
abv
i
think
one
of
these
would
do
just
fine
drinkability
i
think
the
best
days
for
this
barleywine
are
ahead
of
it
as
it
still
has
a
bit
of
harsh
character
that
limits
the
drinkability
otherwise
there
is
a
lot
to
like
and
considerable
complexity
this
is
hands
down
the
best
english
barleywine
i
have
had
so
far
wish
i
could
have
found
more
while
in
denver
d
for
an
american
barleywine
the
strong
hops
can
be
expected
and
the
hidden
alcohol
make
this
a
wonderful
drinker
drinkability
very
good
but
very
strong
d
i
think
a
bomber
of
this
is
the
perfect
amount
it
may
be
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
pretty
solid
all
around
another
good
winter
beer
fantastic
beer
i
may
have
received
this
bottle
in
its
prime
though
mirror
mirror
is
higher
in
alcohol
the
bite
has
largely
faded
the
strength
is
in
the
simplicity
each
individual
flavor
is
allowed
to
shine
rather
than
compete
for
dominance
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
remarkable
beer
d
how
much
could
i
drink
this
beer
in
one
night
well
one
bottle
was
enough
to
sip
over
a
couple
of
hours
would
i
drink
this
beer
again
certainly
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
but
wished
i
had
let
is
sit
longer
and
maturemellow
some
more
overall
impression
quite
good
now
with
potential
to
be
great
excellent
subtle
use
of
barrel
aging
could
be
quite
surprising
in
another
year
or
so
too
bad
it
was
my
only
bottle
verdict
awesome
and
worth
every
penny
of
your
paycheck
must
find
syrupy
honey
malts
provide
lots
of
sweetness
and
the
hops
are
holding
on
pretty
well
in
the
taste
still
a
big
beer
as
it
finishes
with
a
light
alcohol
burn
hop
flavors
remind
me
a
bit
of
mirror
pond
about
as
sweet
as
you
can
get
without
being
cloying
very
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
with
a
full
mouthfeel
quite
tasty
mild
herbal
hops
and
toasted
malts
up
front
big
pudding
toffee
and
sugary
malt
notes
follow
and
swell
notes
of
oak
vanilla
caramel
and
brown
sugar
weave
in
and
out
herbal
slightly
piny
tannic
hop
bitterness
fills
in
and
balances
some
of
the
malty
warming
goodness
finish
is
a
nice
mix
of
this
moderate
bitterness
and
lingering
toffee
fruit
and
oak
fullbodied
with
a
mostly
creamy
feel
a
very
nice
tasting
barleywine
with
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
the
oak
adds
a
nice
but
not
overpowering
dimension
too
bottle
pours
a
clear
reddish
with
a
pretty
large
head
aroma
is
sweet
raisins
and
a
really
pronounced
burned
cashew
thing
that
is
really
offputting
bad
sweet
and
pretty
creamy
in
the
mouth
some
nice
dark
fruit
presence
shines
but
a
heavy
bittering
element
really
clashes
here
not
sure
whether
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
hoppy
expression
or
not
too
sweet
not
balanced
and
the
burned
nut
thing
going
on
is
just
bad
in
my
opinion
on
a
positive
note
its
not
all
that
hot
for
an
11
beer
decently
drinkable
and
delicious
pours
a
nice
redbrown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
moderate
retention
in
my
snifter
the
nose
is
quite
complex
bringing
in
a
good
dose
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
along
with
some
really
nice
maltgood
notes
of
caramel
sweet
bread
cherries
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
out
there
and
this
relatively
fresh
about
four
months
old
when
consumed
bottle
had
a
bit
of
booze
good
body
with
some
booze
and
a
nice
sweetness
this
was
really
nice
fresh
and
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
some
age
does
to
it
this
seems
like
an
almost
bizarre
take
on
the
style
it
isnt
superb
but
i
dont
dislike
it
rather
i
imagine
it
would
be
an
ideal
barleywine
to
age
for
various
intervals
presently
it
seems
to
be
in
an
awkward
phase
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
at
some
point
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
for
the
style
drinkability
is
very
good
it
had
some
great
flavors
and
was
very
complex
the
barrel
aging
added
a
great
complexity
to
it
without
overpowering
it
excellent
beer
overall
and
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
style
could
i
drink
a
couple
of
these
sure
i
have
but
the
point
is
that
id
rather
order
something
else
next
time
as
it
becomes
a
bit
monotonous
and
overbearing
with
this
potency
of
flavor
id
expect
more
than
just
punchy
caramel
and
malt
but
it
lacks
complexity
and
distinctive
character
some
time
would
surely
help
for
now
not
great
not
my
favorite
not
better
in
bottle
drinkability
is
really
nice
for
what
it
is
drinks
much
lower
than
11
and
smooth
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
lingering
sweetness
and
no
sticky
feel
hops
are
manageable
too
mirror
mirror
pours
somewhere
between
a
deep
marron
and
a
rich
amber
depending
on
how
well
its
lit
three
fingers
of
creamy
beige
head
rise
up
but
it
doesnt
last
long
theres
a
spot
of
lacing
but
not
really
all
that
much
nose
is
a
blast
of
caramel
with
some
resiny
hop
notes
thrown
in
there
as
well
the
nose
was
good
but
mirror
mirror
tastes
even
better
like
the
nose
promised
lots
of
caramel
but
the
malty
flavors
coming
through
are
quite
complex
i
also
find
a
bit
of
biscuit
and
even
some
fruits
apricots
and
figs
that
i
wasnt
expecting
a
noticeable
but
somewhat
tame
wave
of
hop
bitterness
flows
through
next
and
the
same
resinous
hoppy
note
from
the
nose
comes
back
to
close
out
each
sip
the
body
is
rich
and
slick
enough
that
if
it
werent
for
the
moderate
carbonation
it
would
be
a
bit
too
syrupy
overall
though
it
works
though
not
spectacularly
11
abv
and
no
alcohol
well
done
deschutes
that
the
subdued
hop
bite
thanks
to
a
year
of
aging
and
a
great
malty
flavor
make
this
extremely
drinkable
i
have
a
hard
time
remembering
any
barleywine
english
or
american
that
was
disappearing
from
my
glass
so
quickly
dfor
the
abv
its
pretty
amazing
i
kept
sipping
on
til
it
was
gone
i
can
see
how
aging
this
in
pinot
noir
barrels
would
enhance
the
beer
though
it
is
quite
satisfying
on
its
own
and
will
likely
to
continue
to
develop
with
age
stock
up
very
nice
beer
from
deschutes
highly
recommended
dextremely
drinkable
for
an
11
abv
that
is
barely
evident
but
welcome
in
the
taste
this
is
the
third
of
deschutes
reserve
series
beers
i
have
had
after
the
abyss
and
black
butte
xxi
i
just
wish
they
were
more
affordable
compared
to
stones
comparable
offerings
and
compared
to
how
their
year
round
beers
are
so
affordable
at
least
in
salem
oregon
d
a
fantastic
barleywine
in
my
opinion
far
and
away
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
though
that
might
be
because
it
doesnt
much
taste
like
a
traditional
barleywine
i
really
liked
the
belgian
sour
yeast
thing
it
had
going
on
a
subtle
complexity
that
i
really
appreciate
as
well
as
an
outstanding
balancea
characteristic
of
all
the
deschutes
beers
ive
tried
so
far
i
would
and
will
happily
drink
this
again
overall
a
really
good
fruity
barleywine
i
prefer
the
hoppy
ones
myself
but
if
i
was
going
for
fruity
then
this
would
be
near
the
top
of
the
short
list
another
great
offering
from
deschutes
highly
recommend
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
got
from
roberts
rotation
i
prefer
the
hoppy
ones
so
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
another
bottle
but
would
try
again
on
tap
or
if
a
friend
had
one
to
share
no
m
soft
carbonation
creamy
body
bitterness
is
low
alcohol
is
warm
but
very
manageable
drinkability
relatively
nice
quite
an
enjoyable
barleywine
i
dont
know
whether
it
was
the
year
of
age
or
how
the
beer
was
brewed
but
the
hops
both
taste
and
aroma
were
very
muted
for
an
american
barleywine
ive
been
hoping
to
try
mirror
mirror
for
a
while
now
and
even
after
tasting
it
blind
it
didnt
disappoint

still

still

i
would
love
to
see
how
it
develops
over
the
next
year
sweetness
and
a
little
alcohol
warmth
finish
this
brew
off
remarkably
drinkable
this
is
in
the
top
three
barleywines
i
have
had
very
strong
contender
one
of
the
best
barleywines
out
there
pouring
this
beer
you
would
first
notice
the
color
but
instead
the
smell
hit
me
first
a
blast
of
sweet
malts
caramel
some
honey
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
washed
over
me
before
noticing
the
color
i
had
already
got
an
indication
of
what
it
would
look
like
just
by
the
smell
the
color
was
a
dark
amber
with
a
little
off
white
head
which
turned
into
a
thin
lacing
the
taste
was
wonderful
it
totally
matched
the
smell
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
syrupy
this
is
definitly
a
sipper
i
am
thankful
that
i
have
a
few
bottles
left
for
me
to
enjoy
d
this
is
beer
is
great
id
rank
this
above
behemoth
and
old
guardian
but
i
dont
think
its
quite
on
the
level
of
olde
school
from
dfh
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
cap
just
a
few
spots
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
rich
and
intoxicating
hints
of
caramel
figs
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
just
a
faint
hint
of
oak
and
vanilla
that
i
would
probably
miss
if
i
did
not
read
the
label
on
the
bottle
the
flavor
does
not
let
me
down
after
the
outstanding
aroma
thick
and
chewy
caramel
and
toffee
a
little
dark
fruit
as
well
alcohol
makes
its
presence
know
but
it
is
not
overly
hot
or
harsh
bitterness
is
moderate
but
i
do
not
pick
up
any
hop
flavor
the
body
is
certainly
thick
enough
and
has
a
nice
low
carbonation
it
coats
the
mouth
nicely
this
beer
is
a
sipper
and
probably
should
be
shaired
i
should
buy
another
bottle
and
let
it
age
for
awhile
thanks
to
my
buddy
jeremy

bringing
this
one
over
poured
a
golden

a
dime
thick

a
malt
bomb
with
a
sweet

nose
we
drank
this
one
with
a
cuban
in
hand
and
it
was
a
perfect
pair
just
the
right
amount
of
oak
for
a
mild
cigar
d
wasnt
sure
what
i
was
getting
into
with
a
barleywine
but
was
very
pleased
with
my
first
surprisingly
smooth
with
great
balance
throughout
the
beer
thanks
to
my
scott
for
setting
me
up
with
this
very
nice
beer
ill
say
that
this
is
either
the
2nd
or
3rd
best
barleywine
ive
ever
had
similar
in
quality
to
fffs
behemoth
smooth
in
the
finish
but
sticky
on
the
palate
the
texture
and
flavors
especially
that
slight
spiciness
gives
mirror
mirror
a
warming
characteristic
in
the
absence
of
alcoholic
aroma
or
tastes
looking
forward
to
drinking
my
other
bottle
a
year
or
two
down
the
road

out

with

there
is
a
lingering
flavor
of
oak
and
hop
bitterness
left
in

mouth
that
has
some
drying
quality
about
it
that
encourages
the

overall
this
was

good
and
i
could
see
this
brew
getting
even
bette
with
some
more
age
the
best
after
date
was
a
month
ago
42010
and
honestly
it
should
be
even
later
than
that
once
the
beer
fully
warms
there
are
notes
of
dark
brown
sugar
that
is
a
bit
residual
if
you
can
taste
beyond

barleywine
fans
this
is
a
must
try
the
is
easily
one
of
the
best
american
bws
that
ive
had
so
far
ever
so
complex
yet
balancedthe
key
word
for
any
deschutes
beer
imho
the
feel
and
body
are
near
perfect
the
bottle
is
already
1
year
old
i
can
only
dream
of
what
it
will
become
with
more
time
i
better
go
to
the
bottle
shop
now
the
mouthfeel
is
supurb
its
a
medium
viscosity
with
a
fine
light
and
tight
carbination
and
doesnt
leave
your
mouth
feeling
like
you
ate
a
spoonful
of
sugar
i
am
drinking
this
bomber
solo
and
will
slowly
sip
and
enjoy
this
till
the
end
d
overall
not
my
favorite
deschutes
or
bw
but
still
damn
good
the
inconsistency
between
olfactory
and
gustatory
is
detracting
overall
this
is
my
first
deschutes
beer
and
im
lucky
to
have
it
this
isnt
your
normal
american
barley
wine
its
like
a
smooth
malt
driven
cousin
of
it
an
excellent
treat
thats
good
to
the
last
drop
drinkability
is
well
above
average
for
a
barleywine
due
to
the
smooth
texture
of
course
one
bomber
is
plenty
but
it
went
down
with
ease
drinkability
i
did
wait
until
the
prescribed

amazed
at

down
for

the

screams
belgian
abbey
quad
i
loved
this
beer
fresh
but
its
better
now
i
recall
a
more
astringent
hop
flavor
a
year
ago
and
im
glad
it
has
given
way
to
more
complexity
this
beer
tastes
very
hoppy
but
in
an
aged
not
very
tasty
kinda
way
the
hop
presence
is
mostly
just
bitter
without
contributing
positively
to
the
flavor
profile
i
dont
see
how
any
more
age
could
improve
this
one
overall
a
wonderful
barley
wine
super
easy
drinking
and
so
flavorful
im
so
glad
i
have
a
handful
of
bottles
left
i
look
forward
to
what
a
couple
years
does
for
this
stuff
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
amber
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
nice
rich
aroma
of
dark
fruit
leather
oak
and
some
nice
caramel
malt
notes
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
oaky
notes
with
rich
fig
flavors
with
a
warming
slightly
boozy
feeling
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
malty
yet
oily
mouth
coating
this
is
a
fairly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
barelywine
though
i
wish
i
was
able
to
try
this
a
bit
fresher
and
hopefully
i
can
pick
up
some
more
to
try
later
on
d
a
great
barleywine
that
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
for
some
time
it
has
aged
well
and
still
will
benefit
for
a
good
year
yet
has
everything
you
would
expect
from
the
style
sweet
rich
but
in
a
delicate
almost
buttery
way
has
a
warmth
that
fits
it
thanks
again
for
the
generous
beerwolf77
for
opening
this
one
d
good
drinkability
coming
from
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
solid
flavor
profile
dangerously
drinkable
at
11
and
very
well
brewed
this
is
a
pretty
awesome
barleywine
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
and
it
didnt
disappoint
thanks
again
todd
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
11
some
hotter
alcohols
growing
on
me
as
it
gets
closer
to
room
temp
drinkability
very
tasty
and
surprisingly
nonintense
its
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
for
a
heady
11
brew
i
dont
have
any
more
of
this
anymore
but
if
i
did
id
gladly
drink
it
now
poured
into
a
chalice
dark
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
no
lacing
not
much
of
a
scent
that
my
weak
nose
can
tell
the
taste
is
a
strong
carmel
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
oak
dryness
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
a
barleywine
and
even
better
the
alcohol
is
not
even
noticeable
thanks
to
the
aging
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
too
bad
its
so
limited
overall
this
was
a
really
tasty
american
barleywine
that
was
fairly
complex
and
easy
to
drink
thanks
again
esther
recommended
d
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
i
think
it
will
do
pretty
well
aging
and
would
be
a
great
beer
for
converting
wine
drinkers
just
a
superbly
drinkable
barleywine
interesting
enough
for
the
hardest
ba
but
accessible
for
a
novice
drinkability
excellent
barleywine
overall
with
some
nice
added
complexity
from
the
oak
aging
d
was
very
satisfied
with
this
beer
it
was
exceptional
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
again
the
alcohol
is
very
hidden
and
its
just
an
overall
great
beer
d
pretty
well
balanced
and
great
tasting
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
if
you
get
a
chance
go
for
it
overall
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
bad
boy
i
picked
up
a
bottle
while
in
la
last
year
and
after
tasting
this
i
wish
id
picked
up
a
few
more
as
it
will
age
nicely
well
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
a
decent
beer
not
much
more
than
that
for
the
price
and
pedigree
not
what
i
was
looking
for
mouthfeel
is
thick
malty
and
syrupy
with
a
typical
american
barleywine
level
of
carbonation
i
opened
this
bomber
all
by
myself
for
some
reason
not
ideal
but
manageable
drinkability
still
a
little
bit
hot
after
a
year
damn
i
wonder
how
this
would
have
tasted
a
year
ago
probably
hot
as
hell
i
have
one
more
left
and
will
most
likely
age
it
for
at
least
another
six
months
or
until
it
starts
to
cool
back
down
at
nights
here
in
southern
california
i
havent
had
a
bw
in
a
while
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
hued
brown
with
a
fine
head
that
has
retained
a
nice
lacing
on
top
of
the
glass
as
it
sits
still
magically
untouched
by
my
lips
what
am
i
thinking
sitting
here
waiting
ive
been
anticipating
this
moment
for
months
i
opened
one
back
in
december
or
was
january
either
way
it
was
pretty
darn
tasty
then
and
i
expect
the
best
now
citrus
and
floral
scents
rise
to
my
nostrils
with
a
hint
of
some
fresh
cut
wood
upon
first
taste
i
gain
a
nice
juicy
orange
and
spicy
flower
fading
into
a
sweet
hint
of
bourbon
wow
very
nice
i
can
feel
the
carbonation
bite
my
tounge
a
little
and
that
lovely
caramelized
bourbon
taste
brings
itself
forward
a
bit
more
as
i
take
my
next
swig
the
11
it
claims
on
the
bottle
is
not
even
noticed
this
is
sweet
and
refreshing
all
too
often
i
find
barley
wines
to
end
up
bitter
and
sour
at
the
end
but
this
knows
exactly
how
to
maintain
itself
this
is
much
smoother
than
it
was
even
a
few
months
ago
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
buy
one
to
try
now
and
buy
another
to
age
for
another
year
and
try
again
later
and
hey
buy
a
third
to
age
two
years
im
sure
this
will
only
get
better
with
time
d
i
really
liked
this
barleywine
and
think
with
a
little
more
time
on
it
it
could
have
been
even
better
its
11
abv
but
i
barely
tasted
any
and
smelled
none
so
i
think
with
another
6
months1
year
on
it
it
could
have
been
even
better
great
caramel
malt
and
oak
smell
and
taste
and
would
have
again
going
to
try
and
pick
up
another
bottle
to
hold
onto
for
a
bit
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
decent
size
tan
head
smell
is
lots
of
dark
fruits
and
caramel
malt
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
dark
fruits
figs
raisons
plums
some
oakiness
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
pushing
full
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
well
balanced
barleywine
d
had
no
problem
drinking
the
bomber
but
i
wouldnt
drink
another
one
if
i
had
one
overall
a
fine
example
of
an
american
barleywine
from
deschutes
do
they
ever
produce
anything
that
is
bad
at
least
nothing
i
have
sampled
looking
forward
to
sampling
the
2005
vintage
i
have
in
the
near
future
to
see
if
age
brings
the
malts
more
into
the
forefront
overall
a
very
pleasant
drinking
experience
sweet
figgy
flavor
balanced
by
slight
hop
bitterness
with
very
good
color
and
presentation
i
recommend
trying
it
at
least
once
pours
amber
and
garnet
red
smells
like
caramel
toffee
and
a
lot
of
sweet
alcohol
tastes
sweet
with
caramel
and
a
little
oakiness
with
a
sweet
quick
alcohol
burn
finish
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
thick
drinkability
is
good
for
a
barleywine
but
its
definitely
a
sipper
d
not
bad
for
the
age
i
was
honestly
expecting
hell
ive
had
a
few
bws
with
the
one
year
on
them
and
they
have
all
been
weird
and
bad
two
years
is
usually
the
minimum
time
for
them
for
me
this
wasnt
bad
too
bad
they
took
so
long
to
come
to
mn
i
woulda
loved
to
try
this
fresh
well
see
how
it
does
with
some
more
time
id
get
this
again
but
a
little
pricey
overall
it
is
drinkable
considering
the
abv
pretty
nice
all
in
all
i
am
super
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
beer
perfect
5
year
anniversary
brew
awesome
balance
of
hops
and
malts
definitely
hunt
this
brew
down
whether
you
enjoy
hops
and
or
malts
this
is
a
very
mass
appealing
brew
definitely
worth
the
hype
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
a
damn
good
one
but
no
where
near
the
top
of
the
class
if
gratitude
is
the
ceo
of
the
barleywine
corporation
this
beer
is
upper
middle
management
ill
drink
again
in
a
few
months
and
see
if
anything
magical
happens
on
420
very
nice
beer
over
all
i
am
looking
forward
to
getting
a
few
more
and
aging
them
the
beer
was
very
full
bodied
and
had
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
which
was
too
much
for
my
personal
preference
i
really
didnt
find
this
particular
example
very
drinkable
mostly
due
to
the
huge
amount
of
sweetness
i
just
felt
really
full
after
eight
or
so
ounces
overall
barleywines
arent
my
favorite
style
but
im
thankful
to
have
tried
this
its
one
of
the
better
ones
if
tried
drinkability
a
delicious
companion
and
an
interesting
counterpart
to
other
barleywines
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
smooth
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
am
glad
to
have
deschutes
in
minnesota
and
very
happy
they
brought
some
mirror
mirror
into
the
state
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
easily
dthis
is
not
hot
at
all
and
not
boozy
at
all
big
flavors
and
very
well
done
the
35
oak
is
very
faint
but
hints
of
it
showed
up
the
balance
is
tremendous
as
the
hops
have
a
definite
place
in
this
beer
but
it
is
still
malt
forward
the
texture
is
so
generous
rich
and
creamy
that
it
feels
like
dessert
in
my
mouth
one
of
the
best
drinking
barleywines
ive
had
so
far
alcohol
is
very
wellconcealed
excellent
beer
d
big
beer
alcohol
is
matched
well
with
a
wide
range
of
bold
flavor
d
alchohol
is
very
well
hidden
although
thin
the
complex
flavor
profile
really
help
this
one
stand
out
must
try
i
am
excited
deschuts
is
now
in
mn
i
really
hope
to
see
this
as
one
of
the
beers
in
mn
a
thick
body
for
a
clear
brew
and
low
carbonation
i
cannot
describe
it
as
syrupy
but
there
is
definitely
more
than
a
medium
mouthfeel
to
this
barleywine
i
hesitated
to
think
that
it
is
an
american
barleywine
as
there
is
not
an
overwhelming
amount
of
bitterness
but
a
pleasant
hop
presence
that
you
may
forget
is
there
with
the
strong
malt
backbone
and
barrel
presence
over
all
a
solid
bw
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
with
its
malty
sweetness
that
isnt
too
sweet
solid
expensive
but
well
worth
the
price
notes
bottle
says
best
after
date
which
is
about
a
year
away
but
i
disagree
i
think
this
is
spot
on
now
and
a
year
might
actually
dull
the
hops
down
a
bit
too
much
especially
since
its
already
on
the
sweeter
side
of
things
guess
ill
have
to
hoard
one
and
find
out
overall
this
is
kind
of
an
odd
barleywine
for
coming
from
the
hophead
world
of
the
west
coast
this
is
more
in
line
with
an
english
barleywine
than
an
american
one
medium
bodied
with
very
light
carbonation
soft
and
creamy
on
the
tongue
flavor
begins
with
mild
oaky
and
woody
notes
before
the
strong
malt
backbone
provides
a
strong
sweet
body
lots
of
caramel
and
biscuit
with
the
ripe
fruits
and
figs
from
the
aroma
mild
citrus
and
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
along
with
sweet
booziness
but
a
year
seems
to
have
smoothed
out
any
bitterness
or
alcohol
burn
the
oak
provides
a
nice
subtle
flourish
to
this
without
being
distracting
very
complex
and
nicely
balanced
a
pleasant
sipping
barleywine
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
reserve
beer
from
deschutes
but
that
is
a
first
i
had
this
back
in
december
and
did
not
review
it
but
remembered
it
fondly
revisiting
it
i
was
excited
but
ultimately
let
down
for
12
there
is
very
little
value
in
this
offering
and
i
will
recommend
everyone
to
avoid
it
i
have
had
better
4
bombers
of
barley
wine
that
i
enjoyed
more
deschutes
is
still
top
notch
in
my
eyes
but
perhaps
the
best
after
april
2010
date
was
a
little
misguided
poured
a
nice
deep
amber
color
good
carbonation
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
malty
caramel
and
bown

taste
is

sugar
well
hopped
abv
is

has
a
very
smooth
sherry
like
feel
so
smooth
and
balanced
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
and
medium
bodied
but
very
good
overall
mouthfeel
is
well
balanaced
and
tasty
exceptional
barleylywine
d
a
tasty
nw
barleywine
i
am
really
jazzed
that
i
got
to
try
this
i
was
in
washington
a
few
years
ago
but
missed
having
this
the
barleywine
is
drinkable
as
it
can
be
for
11
but
not
something
i
would
drink
in
repeated
servings
with
almost
1
year
on
this
bottle
it
was
a
pleasure
to
taste
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
a
barleywine
that
doesnt
really
taste
as
heavy
nor
as
strong
as
barleywines
usually
taste
dont
worry
though
thats
a
good
thing
a
nice
aroma
coming
from
the
inch
of
head
from
my
small
tulip
glass
feels
awesome
going
down
and
tastes
wonderful
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
as
they
do
pack
a
punch
d
ive
got
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
im
just
going
to
age
them
longterm
several
years
and
see
where
they
go
right
now
theyre
not
doing
all
that
well
i
liked
the
beer
substantially
better
fresh
ill
be
honest
i
was
pretty
excited
for
this
beer
and
it
dissapointed
me
in
almost
every
way
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
it
just
doesnt
seem
right
alas
this
is
a
great
barleywine
and
ranks
among
the
best
ive
had
however
i
regret
opening
this
bottle
very
much
after
i
popped
the
cap
i
noticed
a
small
stamp
on
the
side
of
the
label
that
says
best
after
42010
i
definitely
love
this
brew
its
complex
and
drinkable
sweet
and
delicate

really
great
barleywine
alcohol
roughens
as
it
warms
sweet

but
didnt
have
quite
as
much
depth
as
i
expected
ill
have
to
keep
my
eye
out
for
an
earlier
vintage
or
one
i
can
stash
away
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
to
see
how
it
changes

but
malty
sugar
dominates
but
is
is
not
cloying
sweet
the
sweetness
helps
the
beer
become
much
more
drinkable
just
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
touch
to
warm
me
up
a
wonderfully
put

barleywine
probably

this

i

a

when

this
is

i

and
that
that
point
its
just

this
is
unquestionably
one
fine
barleywine
i
wanted
to
save
it
until
the
recommended
consumption
date
but
without
trying
it
fresh
there
would
be
no
point
for
reference
i
will
definitely
have
to
grab
another
bottle
now
and
lay
on
it
for
a
while
deschutes
is
a
hell
of
a
brewery
that
is
climbing
my
personal
faves
list
fairly
quickly
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
pretty
approachable
for
such
a
heavy
bodied
barley
wine
the
alcohol
heat
makes
it
a
sipper
but
a
very
pleasant
sipper
i
am
happy
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
its
like
a
in
a
year
or
two
drinkability
is
good
not
amazing
but
very
respectable
for
the
style
a
slow
sipper
that
doesnt
wear
overly
on
the
palate
a
bit
hot
still
but
not
too
bad
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
d
you
wouldnt
normally
think
of
a
barleywine
as
drinkable
but
this
beer
is
just
so
complex
and
delicious
deschutes
released
the
2009
reserve
mirror
mirror
this
passed
week
this
very
age
worthy
barley
wine
was
born
of
a
double
batch
of
deschutes
popular
mirror
pond
pale
ale
on
the
bottle
it
says
best
after
04202010
and
they
are
right
it
definitely
needs
to
settle
down
in
order
to
get
the
full
experience
when
i
drank
this
11
abv
monster
my
mouth
was
filled
with
flavors
of
caramely
hops
which
leads
into
a
enormous
malty
base
with
hints
of
citrus
and
oak
both
on
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
if
you
can
keep
your
hands
off
of
it
defintely
wait
and
age
this
beer
and
with
the
ungodly
amount
of
wax
covering
it
may
take
you
a
year
to
open
it
drinkability
hot
damn
a
stellar
brew
and
one
that
even
though
i
wasnt
sure
i
was
going
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
tonight
near
bout
floored
me
complex
with
a
solid
foundation
an
inspired
hop
profile
and
nuanced
and
wellintegrated
barrel
components
but
still
accessible
theres
not
too
much
wrong
with
this
one
and
though
it
is
11
abv
and
im
growing
near
tipsy
as
i
finish
this
one
up
at
145
am
the
alcohol
is
warm
never
hot
and
wellblended
never
distracting
or
laying
atop
the
brew
as
it
were
another
winner
from
a
brewery
that
rarely
disappoints
a
fine
and
fitting
addition
to
the
reserve
series
and
one
id
be
glad
to
have
again
and
again
perhaps
with
a
pungent
chunk
of
roquefort
or
stilton
stellar
it
was
almost
blasphemy
to
drink
it
this
young
but
im
glad
i
bought
more
than
one
it
pours
a
rich
mahogany
almost
garnet
in
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
clings
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
aromas
are
citrusy
resinous
hops
followed
by
massive
amounts
of
brown
sugar
fig
a
bit
of
pineapple
and
toffee
flavors
are
immense
beginning
with
fruity
floral
hop
characters
an
onslaught
of
malt
notes
come
through
caramel
fig
candi
sugar
pineapple
citrus
you
name
it
and
its
there
the
beer
finishes
just
slightly
oaky
balanced
out
with
a
bitter
hop
note
mm
has
one
of
the
best
mouthfeels
i
have
experienced
in
a
barleywine
full
bodied
resinous
and
downright
sexy
for
its
strength
and
body
its
very
drinkable
it
wouldnt
be
hard
for
me
to
enjoy
a
couple
bombers
in
one
night
this
barleywine
is
too
good
to
pass
up
i
would
drink
this
beer
any
chance
i
get
regardless
of
the
season
its
that
damn
good
deschutes
my
hats
off
to
you
cheers
nice
flavors
big
date
fig
caramel
toffee
prune
on
the
finish
very
bitter
earthy
hops
at
the
end
with
some
tannic
oak
not
overly
complex
does
show
some
wood
and
whiskey
deep
copper
color
with
a
reddish
tint
and
a
fuzzy
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
toffee
caramel
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
nose
smells
like
it
will
be
sweet
but
as
i
press
the
glass
to
my
lips
it
isnt
the
citrus
hop
and
alcohol
bite
definitely
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
still
some
brown
sugar
toffee
caramel
pierce
through
the
taste
is
incredible
im
glad
i
bought
more
than
one
of
these
light
carbonation
medium
to
thin
body
sticky
oily
mouthfeel
about
the
only
thing
i
could
fault
is
a
bit
of
lack
of
body
but
i
could
live
with
that
great
barley
wine
notes
with
a
little
oxidation
this
one
will
be
absolutely
epic
i
can
see
myself
sitting
on
this
for
a
long
time
d
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
style
a
solid
offering
and
one
i
return
to
on
a
regular
basis
4
25
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
barlywine
with
the
punch
this
has
very
enjoyable
for
an
11er
this
isnt
bad
at
all
i
wouldnt
rate
it
too
high
as
far
as
wanting
another
bottle
right
after
finishing
this
one
though
d
to
date
this
is
my
favorite
barleywine
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
punch
180
despite
being
paired
with
the
best
pretzel
i
ever
had
and
my
first
visit
to
stones
bistro
i
cant
give
this
any
higher
marks
perhaps
it
was
the
more
restrained
approach
to
the
style
i
will
have
to
revisit
eventually
d
would
drink
again
however
at
the
hefty
price
tag
and
richness
its
best
enjoyed
on
a
special
occasion
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
even
relatively
fresh
had
a
solid
but
not
overpowering
hop
presence
that
deferred
to
the
big
sweet
malt
and
fruit
backbone
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
sweet
but
not
too
thick
and
just
perfectly
balanced
indulgent
yet
refined
like
a
posh
library
would
additional
cellar
time
help
this
beer
it
will
surely
smooth
the
flavor
a
bit
but
a
good
offering
right
now
nonetheless
ehhh
im
not
wowed
by
this
one
overhyped
id
say
so
rusty
and
kinda
boring
underdone
hop
profile
not
worth
the
money
3
0
pours
a
thick
viscous
orange
with
a
tiny
head
to
start
that
fades
to
nothing
nice
aromas
of
sweet
malt
lots
of
bitter
citrus
and
a
nice
accent
of
oak
but
the
oak
is
not
overdone
similar
flavors
as
the
aroma
nice
honeyed
malt
with
balnced
citrus
and
pine
bitterness
and
just
enough
oak
to
provide
a
nice
base
smooth
obviously
big
but
easy
to
drink
lovely
this
is
an
excellent
brew
for
sipping
the
alcohol
level
is
quite
pronounced
and
seems
even
higher
than
advertised
this
brew
almost
lives
up
to
the
fable
rhyme
its
name
suggests
and
is
one
of
the
great
contemporary
craft
beers
i
was
not
sure
how
this
beer
would
be
it
is
a
barleywine
so
i
expected
an
alcohol
bomb
i
was
very
surprised
that
it
wasnt
fresh
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
tastes
in
a
year
reviewed
on
06212009
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
of
raisin
caramel
toffee
and
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
decent
but
the
palate
is
too
sticky
and
sweet
this
was
just
ok
for
me
i
had
this
beer
at
the
beer
fest
in
seattle
the
beer
was
excellent
i
had
four
ounces
of
it
the
taste
was
good
i
liked
the
way
it
looked
i
could
actually
picture
myself
drinking
it
which
was
good
also
the
mouth
feel
was
good
it
was
a
little
odd
in
the
mouth
taste
but
i
think
that
might
have
been
from
the
way
it
was
served
deschutes
mirror
mirror
is
a
very
clear
dense
red
ale
with
a
thin
dense
light
khaki
head
that
shows
great
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
woodsy
piny
aroma
the
hops
are
stronger
than
the
malt
in
the
nose
theres
a
light
note
of
toffee
its
full
bodied
smooth
and
fluffy
until
the
dry
astringent
finish
comes
it
tastes
pretty
sweet
but
its
well
balanced
with
a
wooden
resiny
oaken
bitterness
its
quite
drinkable

have
also
tried
the
2005
in
the
past
currently
drinking
from
my
grottenbier
goblet
color
is
a
very
deep
copper
with
some
ruby
red
tint
1
inch
frothy
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
almost
ten
minutes
great
lacing
at

none

aroma
consists
of
oak
peaches
sweet
malts
mild
whiskey
alcohol
grassy
accents
mellow
spice
caramel
toffee
floral
accents
and
raisins
flavor
starts
off
with
caramel
and
other
rich
malts
right
off
the
bat
some
honey
and
grassy
flavors
in
the
middle
some
hoppiness
in
the
finish
but
is
mostly
oak
and
warmth
from
the
booze
that
you
get
creamy
boozy
malty
and
rich
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
pretty
mellow
carbonation
taste
lingers
long
i
will
probably
polish
off
this
bottle
myself
it
is
lighter
for
a
barleywine
has
a
nice
hop
presence
to
balance
the
malts
and
rich
alcohol
has
a
nice
smoothness
especially
as
it
continues
to
warm
up
good
drinkability
will
drink
more
of
this
in
the
future
although
it
is
not
along
the
lines
of
abyss
it
is
one
of
deschutes
better
beers
recommended
had
this
on
tap
at
the
bier
stein
as
well
as
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
goblet
wow
you
can
smell
this
thing
from
a
foot
away
it
pours
out
with
a
deep
reddishbrown
color
and
a
nice
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
earthy
and
oaky
but
at
the
same
time
fruity
as
of
cherries
or
cranberries
the
taste
is
amazing
so
many
different
types
of
malts
but
its
ultimately
very
fruity
and
mainly
i
taste
cherry
though
there
is
a
sweeter
and
deeper
undertone
there
as
well
you
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
making
this
one
of
the
most
drinkable
barelywines
ive
ever
encountered
none
of
that
gagging
pure
ethanol
or
overwhelming
ripe
fruit
taste
going
on
here
that
one
can
often
get
with
a
barelywine
id
even
drink
this
in
a
season
thats
not
winter
thats
how
good
it
is
great
great
stuff
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
that
im
hoping
will
improve
with
age
i
have
a
couple
others
stashed
no
one
will
be
touching
them
until
the
best
after
date
d
flavorful
and
interesting
goes
to
11
abv
makes
it
a
good
beer
to
share
a
basic
error
free
barleywine
that
is
wonderfully
balanced
on
all
fronts
a
huge
malt
foundation
lays
the
ground
work
with
strong
toffee
caramel
and
molassas
flaovrs
the
texture
rides
the
fence
of
sweetsyrupy
and
drymalty
fruity
esters
bring
out
juicy
plumbs
dates
grapes
figs
and
dried
fruits
of
prunes
and
raisons
with
the
malt
sweetness
the
fruits
take
on
a
fruitcake
taste
and
complexity
rumlike
alcohols
give
an
aggressive
power
to
the
beer
but
never
dominates
with
fusal
or
harshness
hop
flavor
has
a
mild
herbal
taste
but
ultimately
is
used
as
a
bittering
agent
against
the
malts
the
malt
fruit
and
hop
character
gives
the
same
impression
from
nose
to
finish
with
a
long
lingering
malt
taste
a
supurb
barleywine
that
should
age
well
from
years
4
5
d
this
is
by
far
the
most
drinkable
barleywine
it
is
jam
packed
with
flavor
but
doesnt
have
that
cloying
sensation
like
many
other
barleywines
d
very
tasty
very
balanced
a
bit
warm
but
this
should
mellow
wonderfully
with
age
well
done
deschutes
taste
is
fairly
creamy
soft
carbonation
good
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
the
heat
isnt
as
strong
as
it
was
in
the
aroma
but
i
can
imagine
with
that
additional
year
on
this
it
would
be
even
better
had
a
snifter
of
the
2005
in
early
may
and
it
was
transcendent
is
this
younger
version
equally
awesome
oh
yeah
definitely
it
tastes
simply
excellent
now
but
i
guess
itll
be
excellent
in
a
different
way
after
april
20
2010
md
the
brew
is
smooth
but
feels
sugary
on
the
tongue
and
coats
the
mouth
although
sweet
it
is
more
drinkable
than
normal
barleywines
d
a
very
tasty
beer
but
at
12
a
bomber
my
drinkability
score
cannot
go
above
a
4
at
11
abv
this
is
definately
a
good
choice
for
sharing
a
beer
i
would
definately
recommend
to
try
d
give
it
a
year
and
i
imagine
it
could
be
something
out
of
this
world
would
like
to
trade
so
that
i
might
be
able
to
rerate
this
beer
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
d
wow
and
they
say
this
is
best
after
april
2010
im
glad
i
have
a
couple
of
bottles
for
the
cellar
one
of
the
best
bwines
ive
had
in
a
long
time
09
and
feelin
fine
what
a
lame
way
to
start
a
review
pours
clear
and
dar
ruby
in
color
rocky
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
a
very
sweet
boozy
citric
and
fruity
bonanza
very
complex
and
unique
taste
is
a
blend
of
booze
pineapple
pear
apple
sweet
malt
and
some
candi
sugar
again
incredible
intense
and
complicated
a
very
smooth
warming
effect
as
it
goes
down
slightly
fuller
body
but
not
too
bad
overall
an
amazing
beer
the
alcohol
though
present
is
a
great
aspect
of
this
beer
im
curious
to
see
how
my
other
bottle
tastes
in
a
year
or
two
m
d
a
richer
body
thick
and
even
a
little
clinging
without
being
syrupy
the
alcohol
warms
the
throat
more
as
the
beer
itself
is
given
time
to
warm
and
makes
for
a
very
pleasing
drinking
experience
considering
the
content
iits
amazingly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
quite
an
exceptional
beer
from
an
exceptional
brewery
very
nicely
done
and
i
hope
i
can
come
across
more
of
it
j
pours
a
beautiful
deep
amber
color
with
a
hint
of
brown
that
is
brilliant
in
clarity
not
much
head
is
built
up
nor
retained
appears
to
have
very
low
carbonation
hint
of
chocolate
on
the
aroma
maybe
a
hint
of
cherry
flavors
of
fig
plum
and
chocolate
wonderful
flavor
and
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
a
bit
of
astringency
on
the
finish
with
age
this
is
going
to
be
magnificent
very
good
highly
recommended
although
this
beer
is
somewhat
hot
right
now
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
strong
and
alcoholic
right
now
this
should
mellow
quite
beautifully
with
a
little
age
so
happy
to
have
quite
a
few
more
of
these
on
hand
drinkability
take
this
one
slow
because
the
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
you
a
great
selection
to
share
with
some
friends
after
dinner
bomber
ugh
the
annoying
waxed
cap
pours
a
warm
mahogany
with
a
frothy
tan
head
thick
lacing
caramel
and
candied
fruits
in
the
nose
a
bit
of
port
and
wood
along
with
boozy
sugar
heavy
full
mouthfeel
with
nearly
no
carbonation
long
sticky
finish
very
sweet
and
boozy
taste
sugary
caramelmolasses
flavors
dominate
background
of
oak
and
candy
a
piney
hop
flavor
comes
in
the
finish
was
rough
at
first
but
smoothed
out
as
it
warmed
the
11
is
as
masked
as
it
can
be
but
you
do
feel
the
full
brunt
of
the
alcohol
early
on
whew
what
a
beer
ive
barely
made
a
dent
in
the
glass
and
already
im
overwhelmed
by
it
big
and
rich
heavy
and
boozy
this
needs
to
be
sipped
from
a
port
glass
or
a
snifter
theres
no
go
to
be
drinking
this
by
the
pint
very
rich
very
heavy
very
sweet
very
boozy
you
have
been
warned
thanks
to
fishdawg71
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
one
in
a
trade
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
2009
vintage
bomber
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
caramel
with
red
highlights
slight
white
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
dark
candied
fruit
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
dark
fruit
hints
predominate
minimal
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
there
but
is
well
hidden
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
sipped
the
brewer
recomends
cellaring
it
for
a
year
but
i
think
it
is
pretty
tasty
now
overall
i
would
definately
recommend
as
a
solid
barley
wine
pours
deep
ruby
amber
with
tan
head
nose
is
delightful
mix
of
chocolate
candied
oranges
at
christmas
miscellaneous
dark
fruit
and
soft
malt
alcohol
is
somewhat
masked
on
the
palate
and
the
body
is
very
smoothcreamy
as
it
brings
forth
a
rich
malt
sweetness
with
dessertlike
hoppy
candy
flavors
to
balance
it
out
this
one
is
on
the
sweeter
softer
side
which
is
what
i
prefer
this
is
an
odd
review
to
be
sure
cheers
overall
very
nice
though
a
bit
young
looking
forward
to
this
in
a
year
or
five
not
overly
malty
not
overly
hoppy
not
even
all
that
intense
but
damn
near
the
realm
of
baby
bears
porridge
of
just
right
one
of
the
smoothest
and
enjoyable
barleywines
ive
tasted
it
tends
to
pack
a
whollap
more
in
hindsight
than
at
the
present
time
i
cant
necessarily
say
that
this
is
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
but
that
cash
has
already
been
laid
down
and
i
enjoyed
the
ride
all
the
same
a
very
slight
tan
head
disintegrates
quickly
leaving
a
bubbly
lace
and
a
thin
transparent
covering
on
top
of
the
dark
brown
brew
closer
inspection
reveals
some
orange
and
cherry
red
hues
smells
of
very
sweet
malts
mixed
with
sweet
and
sour
cherries
earthen
pine
grain
and
hops
in
the
background
tastes
of
more
sweet
malts
and
cherries
with
a
profound
and
invigorating
alcohol
heat
enveloping
it
all
moving
on
we
get
some
subtle
hops
candy
licorice
redhots
butterschotch
and
a
grain
and
pine
base
the
sweeter
notes
are
prevalent
but
work
themselves
into
the
mix
well
lies
medium
to
heavy
and
goes
down
a
bit
rocky
the
barleywine
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
style
almost
trumping
the
tripel
but
not
quite
yet
and
this
is
one
more
exceptional
example
to
add
to
the
file
under
darn
good
barleywine
list
d
yes
very
drinkable
i
could
go
another
best
bottle
presentation
this
and
dba
pours
a
nice
amber
with
some
nice
head
that
fades
to
a
great
lace
smell
is
sweet
floral
and
surprisingly
light
for
a
barleywine
the
oak
is
definitely
there
as
well
taste
is
exceptional
smooth
caramel
sweet
and
floral
fading
to
an
easy
hop
with
lots
of
oak
i
pick
up
on
the
smoke
as
well
extremely
smooth
fades
to
an
easy
hop
and
crisp
toffee
so
smooth
most
drinkable
barleywine
ive
had
not
a
ton
of
hops
but
extremely
flavorful
alcohol
is
well
hidden
just
a
great
beer
cant
wait
to
have
one
with
time
on
it
mouthfeel
is
dense
and
slightly
sticky
surprising
mellowness
but
full
body
make
it
very
drinkable
brew
very
enjoyable
body
is
great
finishes
hot
not
quite
harsh
but
not
quite
drinkable
pretty
nice
d
this
beer
is
so
complex
and
dangerously
good
i
look
forward
to
cracking
open
my
bottles
in
a
year
or
so
another
awesome
addition
to
the
deschutes
reserve
series
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
evolves
over
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
overall
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
i
am
very
happy
to
have
a
few
to
cellar
worth
every
penny
d
good
beer
overall
but
i
refuse
to
go
beyond
these
ratings
because
this
beer
has
so
much
growing
to
do
it
needs
time
on
it
but
a
damn
fine
barleywine
to
say
the
least
bravo
deschutes
excellent
excellent
excellent
overall
a
very
decent
barleywine
needs
a
little
more
in
the
noise
but
well
made
none
the
less
overall
a
very
nice
clean
american
barleywine
from
deschutes
i
remember
the
2005
one
being
a
bit
better
but
this
is
still
a
fine
beer
i
think
this
beer
would
be
amazing
on
cask
prime
cask
candidate
if
you
ask
me
anyway
pick
some
up
its
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
pours
a
brilliant
burgandy
that
glows
in
the
snifter
with
a
fine
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
beautifully
aroma
has
dried
fruit
figs
apricots
raisins
some
earthy
hops
and
a
touch
of
booze
and
oak
the
flavor
has
tart
dried
fruit
brown
sugar
and
hints
of
oak
with
a
earthy
bitterness
that
lasts
its
mediumbodied
and
very
sticky
coats
your
mouth
with
every
sip
and
extremely
enjoyable
very
balanced
for
being
such
a
young
barleywine
most
of
the
hops
have
broken
down
in
the
2005
leaving
a
barleywine
of
heightened
sweetness
whose
concealment
of
its
11
5
abv
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
id
urge
anyone
to
get
as
much
of
the
2005
as
they
can
the
2009
however
still
needs
time

drinkability
ill
finish
this
bomber
myself
but
itd
be
better
shared
at
this
point
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
mm
but
its
just
boring
and
unrefined
right
now
i
shouldnt
have
any
trouble
leaving
my
bottles
in
the
cellar
alone
for
a
few
years
d
hard
to
compare
to
the
bottle
i
had
week
ago
i
know
i
shouldnt
i
really
think
the
bottle
of
09
exuded
many
fresher
flavors
mostly
in
the
hop
category
the
09
is
not
as
cloying
sweet
and
rich
it
has
a
better
hopcutter
flavor
in
the
mix
dont
get
me
wrong
both
are
great
i
just
found
myself
wishing
for
a
bigger
hop
presence
in
the
05
in
any
event
this
is
just
absolute
top
notch
stuff
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
on
tap
of
course
i
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
and
i
cant
wait
to
watch
the
hops
fade
and
the
malt
become
more
complex
as
this
big
beer
ages
this
is
a
phenomenal
barleywine
that
will
get
even
better
with
age
while
bourbon
and
brandy
barrel
aging
might
be
the
hot
new
thing
in
barleywines
among
other
styles
i
prefer
mirror
mirrors
classic
barleywine
flavors
and
clean
unflavored
oak
subtleties
apologies
for
a
fairly
gushing
review
and
this
final
comment
but
mirror
mirror
is
the
fairest
barleywine
of
all
for
me
time
to
go
buy
a
case
before
its
all
gone
drinkability
overall
is
good
right
now
its
the
style
of
beer
meant
to
be
aged
and
savored
over
time
however
if
you
have
access
to
it
right
now
i
would
suggest
getting
some
baseline
data
for
your
experimentation
the
only
way
to
age
a
beer
is
to
periodically
sample
it
and
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
you
shell
out
for
the
whole
case
and
think
about
it
at
a
later
date
great
young
barleywine
that
will
bring
out
more
depth
in
the
next
few
years
the
pine
bitterness
is
a
bit
acrid
and
could
do
with
some
mellowing
if
theyre
going
to
go
the
uberhopped
american
barleywine
route
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
balanced
hop
profile
glad
i
got
a
full
case
plus
one
of
the
first
batch
left
bottle
says
best
after
42010
im
not
sure
if
ill
ever
get
the
chance
to
try
this
again
and
while
id
love
to
age
it
i
want
to
try
it
now
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
was
about
a
half
inch
in
height
but
receded
quickly
to
a
thin
film
but
left
some
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
boozy
reminiscent
of
brandy
a
hint
of
woodiness
some
dark
and
ripe
fruits
very
sweet
smelling
but
also
very
well
balanced
by
the
piney
smelling
hops
this
smells
fantastic
flavor
is
loaded
with
caramel
malts
brown
sugar
coated
apples
overripe
fruit
some
buttery
oak
brandy
a
touch
of
bubblegum
on
the
finish
and
loads
of
warming
alcohol
yeah
this
probably
would
do
well
with
some
age
on
it
but
its
damn
delicious
as
it
is
hop
bitterness
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
sweetness
not
overly
sweet
and
not
overly
bitter
just
right
for
a
barleywine
everything
is
integrated
seamlessly
medium
mouthfeel
leaning
on
syrupy
but
not
quite
there
lots
of
warming
alcohol
all
the
way
down
the
throat
this
is
a
fantastic
version
of
a
barleywine
perfectly
balanced
and
yummy
i
do
think
this
will
really
be
a
grand
slam
with
a
year
of
age
on
it
but
i
will
savor
every
last
drop
of
this
fresh
bottle
thanks
go
out
to
washburnkid
for
sending
this
one
my
way
this
is
a
nice
bw
cant
decide
if
this
would
be
better
in
the
spring
or
winter
either
way
darn
fine
inventory
issues
aside
this
version
of
mirror
mirror
spent
an
extra
year
in
the
oak
and
has
picked
up
way
more
of
the
woods
ashy
vinous
qualities
the
flavor
is
intense
i
get
hints
of
cigarettes
and
a
bit
of
balsamic
in
nose
that
makes
me
think
this
ones
seen
the
first
signs
of
infection
the
hops
are
all
but
gone
replaced
by
sweet
fruity
malt
port
white
wine
blackberry
syrup
prunes
medium
carbonation
in
a
gloriously
creamy
body
its
smooth
and
pretty
complex
but
the
flavors
heavy
and
syrupy
a
very
pleasant
sipper
nice
touch
of
sweetness
getting
some
of
that
smoky
oak
flavor
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
again
it
really
does
feel
like
im
sipping
on
some
cognac
or
some
type
of
liqueur
just
not
quite
as
alcoholic
and
with
more
carbonation
d
this
is
a
perfect
sipping
beer
and
very
drinkable
for
its
abv
richness
and
fullness
d
for
a
barleywine
the
drinkability
is
very
good
the
palate
isnt
bombarded
with
hops
creating
a
smoother
drink
this
is
quite
good
now
but
could
be
amazing
in
5
years
when
the
sweetness
concentrates
and
the
hops
die
down
a
bit
it
could
rival
an
aged
jw
lees
in
my
opinion
which
is
saying
something
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
but
this
isnt
it
anyway
im
a
sucker
for
any
kind
of
peach
and
apricot
flavors
the
peachiness
in
this
meshes
very
well
with
the
oak
im
enjoying
it
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
aged
overall
a
great
beer
not
crazy
good
cheers
d
not
bad
still
needs
a
year
or
two
of
cellaring
to
minimize
the
hop
bitterness
clear
reddish
brown
liquid
served
with
no
foam
filled
up
to
the
brim
of
a
little
8oz
shaker
pint
glass
cant
catch
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
because
the
glasses
stone
uses
suck
but
i
did
get
that
barleywine
malty
sweetness
a
little
bit
of
fruit
in
the
aroma
thick
malty
body
with
a
really
nice
flavor
minor
bitterness
over
the
tongue
is
very
gentle
not
abrasive
i
thought
this
was
barrel
aged
though
i
wasnt
sure
at
the
time
but
i
couldnt
really
find
any
noticeable
oak
agingwood
character
in
it
im
sure
it
rounded
out
the
flavor
profile
because
it
was
very
smooth
clear
copper
color
as
it
pours
from
the
bottle
and
copper
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
leather
bread
molasses
and
alcohol
taste
is
bready
and
even
a
little
buttery
and
savorysurprising
and
interesting
and
definitely
less
sweet
than
i
expected
with
just
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
in
the
finish
a
touch
of
toffee
maybe
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
dry
with
very
little
carbonation
this
is
a
rich
and
complex
brew
good
for
sharing
and
sipping
22oz
bottle
11
at
the
local
beautiful
ruby
red
or
is
it
orange
i
cannot
tell
this
definitely
needs
some
time
to
mellow
but
wow
delicious
citrus
brown
sugar
oaky
complex
raisins
delicious
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
and
something
i
will
be
buying
more
to
cellar
hopefully
deschutes
starts
making
this
annually
great
to
try
but
not
exceptionally
better
than
a
bigfoot
old
gaurdian
etc
as
has
become
expected
in
deschutes
reserve
series
this
is
a
big
complex
delicious
monster
of
a
beer
with
a
best
after
date
of
2010
i
can
only
imagine
the
wonderful
things
that
will
happen
to
this
beer
with
some
time
in
my
cellar
highly
recommended
this
reminded
me
a
bit
of
fff
alpha
kong
but
not
quite
as
boozy
i
enjoyed
my
first
bottle
of
mirror
mirror
i
bought
two
but
maybe
this
should
be
aged
though
im
not
even
sure
that
would
help
what
i
feel
is
the
issue
the
oak
it
is
really
overwhelming
if
you
love
oak
flavors
this
is
your
beer
i
found
the
oak
a
bit
overwhelming
the
bottle
claims
35
oak
aged
i
would
love
to
try
this
at
25
as
the
oak
really
overwhelms
a
lot
of
the
complexity
that
is
still
perceptible
it
reminds
me
of
southern
tiers
oak
aged
unearthly
though
ive
only
had
that
one
once
ill
let
the
other
bottle
age
and
see
if
it
makes
a
difference
but
again
im
not
sure
that
will
help
it
is
the
oak
not
the
alcohol
that
makes
this
one
fall
short
of
amazing
i
should
note
that
i
generally
love
oak
aged
beers
its
just
that
the
oak
flavor
shouldnt
be
this
dominant
imo
a
must
have
for
anyone
who
digs
a
strong
barley
wine
pours
a
rusty
brown
with
a
silky
tan
head
the
nose
has
fruity
hops
sweet
bready
malts
and
peppery
alcohol
with
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
the
barrel
aging
is
more
evident
in
the
taste
as
the
wood
plays
a
much
larger
role
nutty
malts
are
well
balanced
by
ripe
pitted
fruits
subtle
piney
hops
and
spicy
alcohol
smooth
medium
body
is
nicely
carbonated
and
compliments
the
ale
quite
well
would
call
this
more
of
an
english
than
american
as
the
hops
play
a
minor
role
really
opens
up
as
it
warms
overall
impression
i
had
this
on
tap
last
week
at
the
owl
club
in
roseville
let
me
tell
you
it
was
phenomenal
on
draft
theres
a
reason
the
bottle
says
best
after
42010
this
beer
definitely
needs
time
to
age
and
mellow
out
the
sharp
alcohol
character
but
having
aged
the
abyss
and
black
butte
xx
i
know
my
remaining
11
bottles
will
be
well
worth
the
wait
drinkability
is
exceptional
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
it
reminds
me
of
arctic
devil
from
midnight
sun
this
is
an
excellent
and
very
nicely
aged
barleywine
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
sip
maybe
one
of
the
easiest
in
the
style
fits
more
in
the
british
style
im
curious
what
this
one
tastes
like
fresh
and
thanks
to
deschutes
this
excellent
brew
will
be
back
shortly
very
good
stuff
of
course
i
love
to
try
barleywines
i
had
this
on
my
wish
list
but
noted
as
never
going
to
wander
my
way
what
did
you
say
you
snagged
me
a
bottle
mh
youre
a
barleywine
mad
man
thoroughly
enjoyed
last
night
as
a
cap
to
a
milestone
oak
an
almost
whiskey
character
and
sublime
malt
notes
yup
this
one
has
aged
well
lucky
are
those
witha
few
still
sitting
in
their
beer
cellars
nicely
balanced
with
perfect
carbonation
and
a
big
chewy
body
that
coats
the
tongue
super
drinkability
for
a
large
potent
brew
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
and
i
must
thank
travisd13
for
the
opportunity
and
his
generosity
a
wonderfull
barleywine
taste
mouthfeel
a
big
malty
character
hits
the
palate
immediately
chewy
and
rich
but
thankfully
not
cloying
and
syrupy
too
often
i
find
barleywines
sweet
in
an
overbearing
way
with
no
nuance
or
subtlety
thats
not
the
case
here
as
mirror
mirror
shows
quite
a
bit
of
depth
and
a
subtle
mix
of
flavors
instead
of
merely
beating
you
over
the
heat
with
residual
sugars
all
the
same
theres
plenty
of
toffee
sweetness
to
balance
the
notes
of
tannic
oak
toasted
grain
dried
fruit
red
wine
and
tobacco
alcohol
is
only
faintly
noticed
this
is
far
from
hot
for
weighing
in
at
a
hefty
11
5
nice
firm
bitterness
in
the
finish
along
with
a
touch
of
drying
oak
very
enjoyable
stuff
dynamic
on
the
palate
and
perfectly
balanced
looking
forward
to
bottles
of
this
very
smooth
sipper
i
would
have
pegged
this
as
an
english
rather
than
american
barleywine
very
smooth
and
sweet
overall
a
nicely
complex
barleywine
and
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
deschutes
i
have
not
seen
this
in
bottles
and
i
would
love
to
find
some
and
cellar
it
for
a
year
or
two
to
see
how
it
smoothes
out
drinkability
is
great
the
new
pub
is
really
pulling
out
all
the
stops
with
vintages
offerings
like
this
one
very
tasty
and
rich
i
really
enjoy
the
citric
sweetness
which
is
probably
hops
as
much
as
esters
either
way
time
has
done
a
fantastic
job
of
smoothing
the
edges
without
letting
the
bottom
fall
out
i
really
like
this
beer
well
done
again
deschutes
give
this
beer
a
try
if
you
can
get
the
opportunity
as
always
this
beer
is
terrific
i
think
it
could
use
a
couple
of
years
to
soften
some
of
the
sharp
edges
but
its
a
very
fine
beer
nonetheless
impressive
i
was
very
happy
to
have
tried
this
id
like
to
see
this
one
make
a
comeback
deschutes
new
batch
please
d
great
drinkability
for
a
barleywine
but
with
some
lasting
burn
d
incredibly
drinkable
we
drank
a
few
really
good
barley
wines
that
night
and
the
general
lafayette
275
and
this
stood
out
ahead
of
the
pack
wonderful
beer
pours
a
beautifulslightly
hazychill
haze
possibly
copper
color
thin
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
fine
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
fruity
with
hints
of
apricot
grapes
taste
is
also
amazing
age
has
truly
done
this
beer
well
all
the
flavors
are
very
mellow
and
smooth
hints
of
oak
grape
along
with
a
nice
mellow
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
no
detectable

this
one
is
an
excellent
representation
of
style
and
a
very
good
beer
i
could
stick
with
this
one
for
a
whole

but
the
evening
would
be
over
pretty
quick
with
the
11

overall
impression
well
balanced
barley
wine
nothing
overpowering
in
any
one
area
but
everything
meshes
well
and
its
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
it
has
kind
of
a
harsh
flavor
i
remember
this
being
smoother
when
i
had
it
fresh
which
is
kind
of
odd
its
not
bad
though
and
goes
down

easily

flavor
is
very

like
apples

nice

maple
syrupe

from

very

alcohol
is
wonderfully
masked
behind
it
all
medium

that
makes
quite
a

pleaser
does
not
overwhelm
great
dessert
beer
d
very
nice
to
sip
smooth
and
warm
ill
hope
this
one
ages
nicely
as
deschutes
seems
to
have
a
real
winner
with
this
one
this
is
a
nice
contrast
to
some
of
the
more
brash
barleywines
out
there
and
for
the
record
im
very
fond
of
many
beers
that
resemble
that
description
id
be
happy
to
see
this
offered
more
often
but
i
suppose
i
should
be
happy
they
bottled
it
at
all
hopefully
the
good
folks
at
deschutes
will
make
this
an
annual
tradition
this
drinks
very
well
probably
owing
to
the
mellow
flavors
and
warming
affect
its
hard
to
know
if
ill
feel
the
same
after
the
second
glass
but
its
nice
so
far
the
beer
poured
a
deep
slightly
hazey
reddish
amber
a
nice
finger
of
head
came
and
went
quickly
and
left
a
single
ring
of
fine
lacing
the
nose
featured
a
sweet
sweet
maltiness
along
with
a
underlying
slight
oakiness
the
beers
flavor
provided
a
surprising
quick
dry
hop
bitterness
with
a
sweet
malty
finish
along
with
a
nice
oak
created
vanilla
an
excellent
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
tongue
like
the
touch
from
a
beautiful
woman
the
malts
slowly
mellow
there
the
beer
improves
with
warmth
and
there
the
oak
aging
slowly
peaks
up
more
and
more
this
is
a
darn
fine
barley
wine
and
one
that
is
surpisingly
drinkable
drinkable

in

some

with

through
as
well
could
use
a
bit
of
beefing
up
the
mouthfeel
a

that
was
solid
all
around
but
nothing
spectacular
2005
vintage
aged

into

fairly
bright
and
clear
brown

by
an
inch
or
so
of
creamy

make
their

syrupy
but
not
over
the

some
serious

good

i
hope
deschutes
continues
to
make
this
each

poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
thick
1
tan
head
above
the
slightly
murky
burgundy
brew
plenty
of
sticky
lacing
a
surprise
for
a
brew
that
has
style
and
barrel
working
against
the
lace
aroma
is
sweet
dark
fruits
with
light
oaky
alcohol
notes
taste
has
everything
working
together
the
sweetness
tempered
by
the
wood
and
vanilla
dark
fruit
lurking
about
a
nice
package
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lingering
in
a
good
way
and
drinkability
is
ncie
as
well
in
that
you
want
more
even
though
itll
kick
your
ass
kind
of
way
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
a
lot
but
it
just
left
me
waiting
for
something
more
im
not
sure
what
nonetheless
a
very
nice
brew
d
oh
baby
sip
this
one
i
could
certainly
sip
this
one
all
night
long
this
is
one
of
the
new
american
craft
beers
not
a
tread
but
more
of
what
american
taste
is
about
it
paired
great
with
some
baked
brie
cheese
stuffed
with
raspberries
dark
and
dirty
copper
color
topped
only
briefly
by
a
tan
colored
head
the
nosr
reminds
me
of
an
old
arogant
bastard
i
had
this
weekend
really
had
a
chance
to
drink
a
3
year
old
3
liter
of
db
but
that
is
another
story
strong
citrus
aroma
lots
of
sherry
even
bourbon
this
is
one
of
the
rare
oak
aged
barley
wines
ive
had
where
that
character
comes
across
the
flavor
is
very
soft
dates
vanilla
sherry
with
a
touch
of
citrus
bitterness
on
the
finish
bitterness
is
there
but
really
softened
nice
mouth
feel
a
bit
of
heat
but
really
soft
and
drinkable
im
really
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
drinkability
like
with
the
2005
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
or
more
appropriately
dangerously
sippable
a
wonderful
brew
incredibly
drinkable
i
would
never
think
of
drinking
a
whole
bomber
of
barleywine
in
one
sitting
but
i
couldnt
help
sipping
my
way
right
through
this
one
its
very
very
very
very
mellow
but
flavorful
it
doesnt
need
a
day
of
aging
the
oak
character
was
done
perfectly
in
this
beer
it
is
nice
and
subtle
adding
to
the
complexity
and
not
taking
anything
away
from
the
beer
with
the
often
harsh
notes
that
one
finds
in
oak
aged
beers
having
said
all
that
the
rest
of
the
beer
does
not
quite
live
up
to
this
perfect
use
of
oak
it
is
quite
good
though
and
while
i
was
not
expecting
such
subtle
hop
character
the
focus
on
malt
in
this
barley
wine
is
quite
nice
and
in
fact
makes
it
that
much
better
when
mixed
with
the
oak
notes
obtained
march
2006
and
consumed
that
same
evening
pours
a
cloudy
amber
orange
with
a
one
finger
fine
yellow
head
smells
absolutely
delicious
as
i
write
the
appearance
to
the
nose
its
orange
candylike
with
piney
hops
and
a
flat
almost
chalky
malt
character
not
a
robust
oak
character
like
i
find
in
many
oak
aged
beers
green
raisins
and
a
hint
of
cherry
sour
this
is
a
really
enticing
beer
tastes
pretty
good
but
the
mouthfeel
is
to
die
for
smooth
and
thick
with
a
fine
carb
froth
when
the
liquid
is
sloshed
around
in
the
mouth
taste
is
caramel
oranges
touch
of
alcohol
burn
but
the
alcohol
is
clean
of
any
rough
fusel
character
mildly
vinous
or
brandylike
a
bit
of
cherry
oak
is
really
faint
and
i
only
found
it
after
looking
for
it
as
i
have
ready
access
to
oak
yeti
by
great
divide
brewing
im
used
to
a
real
oak
whallop
this
definitely
has
the
more
subtle
oak
character
and
i
wonder
if
these
barrels
had
been
used
a
few
times
such
that
the
flavor
is
even
more
subtle
hop
bitterness
is
fine
for
an
american
barley
wine
a
bit
of
hop
oil
on
the
flat
of
the
tongue
works
well
with
the
orange
hop
flavor
overall
the
hops
could
be
decribed
as
a
minnieme
of
bigfoot
i
find
bigfoot
to
be
too
brutally
hopped
but
this
to
be
well
done
i
see
this
beer
doing
well
with
time
in
the
cellar
but
i
dont
see
it
as
a
10year
beer
drink
it
now
its
quite
enjoyable
and
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
bomber
right
here
during
the
review
i
dont
see
it
as
too
drinkable
as
the
flavor
is
so
robust
that
one
is
certainly
enough
that
doesnt
mean
i
wouldnt
be
down
to
drink
another
tomorrow
great
stuff
props
to
deschutes
for
this
one
theyre
on
top
of
their
game
right
now
d
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
high
potency
bitterness
on
the
tongue
very
well
done
aroma
is
sweet
oaky
and
slightly
vinous
at
first
becoming
more
delicate
and
fruity
and
the
beer
breathes
and
warms
im
getting
a
lot
of
pear
after
a
bit
taste
seems
quite
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
oak
bite
at
first
but
this
too
rounds
out
quite
nicely
as
the
beer
equilibrates
near
room
temperature
as
such
the
mirror
takes
on
more
subtly
fruity
and
malty
sweet
flavors
with
drunken
raisins
dancing
with
heady
plums
finish
is
sweet
and
just
oaky
and
bitter
enough
to
dry
it
out
a
bit
body
is
nicely
full
without
being
too
thick
and
this
beer
though
a
sipper
drinks
quite
nicely
for
what
is
still
a
relatively
young
barleywine
id
say
delicious
to
drink
now
but
very
worthy
of
some
cellar
time
as
well
i
need
to
find
some
more
of
this
beauty
thumbs
up
says
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
the
stuff
alas
drinkability

i
know
it
doesnt
sound
like
it
but
this
ale
goes
down
quite
well
it
has
some
extreme
flavors
that
cancel
each
other
out
pretty
well
and
that
make
this
a
smooth
ride
this
massive
barley
wine
was
aged
in
french
oak
wine
barrels
to
give
it
that
added
complexity
and
finesse
it
pours
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
medium
lacey
head
that
falls
quickly
which
is
not
uncommon
for
a
beer
at
10
the
aroma
is
big
and
fruity
orange
and
cherry
dominate
with
a
big
sweet
sugary
malt
underlay
the
aromas
carry
over
into
the
flavor
along
with
some
caramel
raisin
and
oak
tones
the
big
slick
mouthfeel
is
offset
by
the
light
fruity
hop
flavor
that
pervades
the
whole
profile
and
cuts
the
sweetness
its
a
big
beautiful
barley
wine
that
should
age
well
admit
ably
the
flavor
profile
is
quite
different
than
any
other
barley
wine
ive
had
but
in
the
best
possible
way
most
rely
on
a
big
caramel
malt
flavor
or
an
80
ibu
bitterness
but
this
barley
wine
is
all
about
assertive
well
integrated
flavors
of
sweet
malt
but
not
big
caramel
and
the
pervasive
hop
flavor
but
not
big
bitter
buy
some
now
for
the
drinkin
and
some
to
stash
away
as
i
do
not
expect
this
beer
to
be
available
long
and
should
be
a
great
addition
to
any
beer
cellar
no
cpmparison
imo
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
similar
but
a
bit
watery
in
the
bottled
version
it
lacks
body
and
the
charcater
that
the
05
version
had
needs
some
backbone
i
do
however
think
this
can
turn
out
to
be
an
excellent
brew
once
a
few
years
of
aging
come
on
will
buy
another
and
compare
a
few
years
down
the
line
this
years
would
get
about
a
3
8
overall
from
me
good
but
nothing
compared
to
the
outstanding
05
deschutes
new
barley
wine
pours
a
deep
bronzed
amber
with
a
decent
sized
head
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
i
believe
around
1213
the
head
quickly
dwindles
and
disappears
the
aroma
is
a
bit
funky
with
strong
berry
and
cherry
flavors
and
some
fruitiness
from
the
port
and
pinot
casks
it
tastes
incredibly
sweet
to
me
very
much
like
sherry
with
a
sort
of
austere
preserved
fruit
flavor
mixed
in
with
the
toffeeish
malt
theres
also
a
bourbonish
element
from
the
jack
daniels
casks
but
no
sourness
and
i
didnt
detect
any
oak
or
vanilla
flavors
that
one
usually
finds
in
caskaged
beers
i
was
surprised
at
the
lack
of
hoppiness
both
in
aroma
and
bitterness
although
i
should
admit
i
just
had
a
randallized
full
sail
wreck
the
halls
just
before
trying
this
so
perhaps
my
hop
receptors
were
shot
still
for
a
u
s
barley
wine
particularly
a
west
coast
one
the
hops
were
subdued
almost
invisible
as
i
slowly
worked
through
the
halfpint
more
funky
aromas
and
flavors
became
evident
particularly
a
strong
sense
of
parmesan
cheese
2011
vintage
on
draft
very
smooth
and
balanced
2012
vintage
obviously
no
hop
character
left
if
there
was
any
first
time
having
the
beer
tons
of
dark
fruit
malty
sweetness
dates
figs
plum
really
good
not
as
strong
as
i
am
use
to
from
a
barley
wine
good
flavor
from
the
stone
fruits
and
light
bitter
finish
not
boozy
at
all
but
i
kinda
like
that
about
a
barley
wine
overall
not
a
bad
drink
worth
having
but
def
not
a
goto
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
barleywine
absolutely
fantastically
awesome
o
age
has
treated
this
beer
well
this
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
barleywine
bold
flavors
of
sweetness
and
an
alcohol
presence
thats
noticeable
but
subdued
enough
to
make
for
a
smooth
drink
outstanding
o
a
good
barley
wine
at
time
the
butterscotch
and
plum
dont
mix
but
good
overall
so
ive
had
many
tries
at
different
barleywines
and
have
yet
to
find
one
that
wasnt
a
drainpour
this
one
by
flying
dog
is
the
first
that
actually
tasted
good
to
me
no
booziness
no
extreme
bitter
finish
no
medicinal
aspiriny
aftertaste
this
one
was
a
winner
highly
recommend
overall
okay
a
bit
too
sweet
without
the
balancing
bitterness
perhaps
but
this
is
stull
full
of
interesting
and
complex
malt
flavor
definitely
a
beer
for
fans
of
the
maltysweet
barleywines
which
i
am
though
even
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
bitterness
offered
here
still
a
good
brew
that
i
rather
enjoyed
give
it
a
try
if
you
have
access
to
it
thanks
again
dad
from
bottle
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
not
the
most
impressive
barley
wine
ive
had
aroma
is
okhead
lacing
are
nonexisistant
the
next
thing
along
that
impresesses
is
the
abv
super
strong
but
the
flavor
is
in
the
back
seat
od
this
is
probably
past
its
prime
but
also
quite
complex
and
interesting
as
it
warmed
it
opened
up
with
much
more
interesting
flavours
enjoying
this
one
slowly
but
the
medicinal
and
syrupy
sweetness
are
a
stretch
an
awesome
beer
that
packs
a
punch
and
plenty
of
flavor
a
must
have
for
fans
of
bold
dark
beers
o
i
feel
like
the
aging
made
this
one
better
but
it
is
certainly
a
big
sweet
barleywine
the
depth
of
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
and
worth
a
try
o
big
flavors
powerful
brew
very
drinkable
could
put
you
under
the
table
if
youre
not
paying
attention
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
chewy
viscous
and
sweet
with
hot
alcohol
hanging
on
in
the
finish
overall
my
mouth
salivates
every
time
i
have
this
brew
personal
pick
for
best
english
style
barleywine
made
in
the
u
s
a
balanced
with
great
length
looking
forward
to
tasting
after
aging
a
few
years
vintage
2011
an
impressive
take
on
the
style
nicely
mellowed
with
time
looks
great
with
a
colour
not
unlike
fortified
wine
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
very
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
subtle
hop
character
that
has
probably
faded
somewhat
the
bitterness
is
pitchperfect
lovely
body
silky
smooth
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
but
without
a
fresh
bottle
to
compare
it
to
i
cant
judge
the
extent
of
the
aging
process
nonetheless
a
big
beer
that
commands
your
attention
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
chance
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
would
not
buy
again
unfortunate
because
bigfoot
was
the
best
barley
wine
i
have
had
to
date
pours
out
a
dark
maroon
in
color
with
a
tiny
brown
head
with
little
retention
and
no
lacing
sweet
is
of
nice
sweet
caramel
malts
candy
sugar
dark
malts
and
maybe
a
little
toffee
taste
is
very
sweet
from
the
candy
sugars
definitely
some
sweet
malts
that
seem
to
be
malt
forward
but
as
many
barlywines
it
is
pretty
sweet
mouthfeel
is
medium
thin
or
maybe
a
tiny
bit
thicker
really
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
too
malty
for
my
taste
great
beer
but
just
a
little
too
malty
o
solid
barleywine
i
dont
know
if
i
agree
with
the
labels
claim
that
it
tastes
like
licorice
and
chocolate
but
ill
pick
this
up
again
five
years
might
have
been
too
long
for
this
beer
i
just
happened
to
have
a
fresh
one
on
tap
this
evening
as
well
and
it
was
much
fuller
in
body
and
ultimately
more
satisfying
the
fresh
one
was
also
a
much
sweeter
malt
bomb
two
years
on
this
beer
might
be
better
to
help
temper
some
of
the
sweetness
but
before
it
becomes
too
thin
and
herbal
a
very
nice
beer
iit
was
poured
from
the
bottle
into
the
glass
the
appearance
is
very
good
not
black
but
dark
brown
and
with
a
very
nice
amount
of
foam
the
taste
is
also
great
a
nice
sweet
taste
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
coffee
and
nuts
nothing
to
dominant
good
balance
very
nice
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
16oz
plastic
champaign
flute
from
bevmo
poured
conservatively
but
it
build
a
12
head
that
degenerates
to
lacing
after
a
few
sips
appearance
is
thick
unfiltered
honey
rich
complex
aroma
flavor
is
bold
hops
some
turpentine
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
enjoyable
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
ive
only
had
couple
other
barley
wine
stylei
especially
recall
bigfoot
which
i
really
enjoy
this
one
is
very
good
but
a
bit
different
in
character
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
glass
2012
vintage
pours
very
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
lace
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
lacing
clings
around
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
molasses
toffee
toast
raisin
prune
biscuit
light
chocolate
light
roast
floral
and
toasted
earthiness
very
nice
aromas
with
good

notes
with
good
strength

light
roast
and
toasted
earthiness
on
the

for
a

awesome
complexity
and
balance
of
dark
malt
and
fruity
notes
with
zero
cloying
sweetness
after
the
finish
lightmedium
carbonation
and
fairly
full
bodied
with
a
very
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
great
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
barleywine
great
complexity
and
balance
of
dark
malt
and
fruity
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
fantastic
probably
my
bottle
has
been
properly
cellared
for
some
time
but
i
think
it
would
improve
further
with
longer
cellaring
o
this
was
my
first
time
drinking
the
horn
dog
so
i
have
no
fresh
example
to
compare
it
too
but
i
would
have
to
say
this
was
a
great
beer
it
has
a
little
bit
of
everything
except
noticeable
hop
characteristics
i
dont
know
if
they
were
there
or
just
faded
over
the
last
several
years
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
fresh
one
and
try
it
next
release
much
of
the
spices
referenced
in
the
brewery
description
have
aged
out
mouthfeel
medium
body
and
mouth
feel
id
buy
this
again
and
may
on
my
way
back
to
mastadonachusetts
another
good
store
lined
up
for
the
voyage
home
tomorrow
overall
a
fairly
complex
and
pleasant
example
of
a
barleywine
got
this
for
4
99
4
pack
and
am
definitely
impressed
will
enjoy
drinking
the
other
3
a
good
malt
complexity
and
very
well
hidden
abv
along
with
some
aged
characteristics
i
see
in
my
favorite
old
ales
nothing
to
complain
about
and
a
barleywine
that
fans
of
the
style
should
give
a
shot
overall
a
solid
american
barleywine
and
easier
drinking
than
most
for
10
2
alcohol
there
is
only
a
slight
evidence
in
the
taste
this
was
pretty
good
overall
o
this
was
my
first
english
bw
i
wasnt
blown
out
of
the
water
by
this
but
it
is
a
decent
and
solid
bw
that
is
very
drinkable
it
is
up
against
stark
competition
with
bigfoot
however
that
one
is
an
american
bw
there
is
nothing
stellar
about
this
bw
but
it
has
no
alcohol
burn
unlike
some
other
ones
which
make
it
ready
on
day
one
o
sweet
and
tangy
multidimensional
boozy
im
very
surprised
i
like
flying
dog
well
enough
but
this
is
a
very
memorable
barley
wine
in
my
opinion
final
thoughts
flying
dogs
horn
dog
english
barleywine
is
a
pretty
great
beer
however
it
lacks
the
certain
special
quality
that
sets
pretty
great
beers
apart
from
world
class
brews
if
you
enjoy
barleywines
and
scotch
ales
id
highly
recommend
seeking
this
one
out
because
it
is
sure
to
please
your
palate
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
overall
i
like
a
lot
of
malt
in
my
beer
so
i
really
enjoyed
this
really
nice
caramel
and
fruit
sweetness
with
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
kick
i
will
gladly
have
again
o
a
decent
barleywine
but
nothing
to
rave
about
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
for
a
5yearaged
brew
i
guess
im
expecting
something
more
o
really
tasty
barleywine
well
balanced
with
a
nice
finish
this
is
one
of
the
best
barleywines
i
have
had
for
the
price
o
looking
forward
to
aging
this
the
malts
are
already
complex
and
excellent
one
of
my
favorite
english
barley
wines
and
way
underrated
horn
dog
definitely
surprised
me
i
love
the
style
and
horn
dog
is
a
fitting
example
recommended
overall
this
has
aged
fairly
well
lots
of
fruity
esters
have
emerged
and
though
the
balance
is
sweet
theres
enough
bitterness
left
to
round
out
the
finish
not
extremely
complex
wellblended
enjoyable
flavors
flying
dog
just
recently
pulled
out
of
az
so
its
nice
to
still
get
to
try
their
beers
the
look
of
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
flat
coke
carmel
color
with
very
minimal
head
the
smell
come
through
as
an
intensely
sweet
barley
wine
the
taste
is
actually
better
than
the
look
and
smell
which
is
alway
a
good
thing
it
is
a
very
sweet
fruity
style
barley
wine
that
i
definitely
can
see
you
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
overall
its
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
it
is
smooth
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
this
10abv
that
is
pretty
hidden
not
great
but
something
worth
trying
overall
a
tasty
balanced
barleywine
o
this
doesnt
break
ground
its
just
a
rock
solid
nofrills
barleywine
it
hits
a
good
balance
between
being
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
savor
hey
flying
dog
can
we
get
a
barrelaged
version
like
right
now
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
barley
wine
very
good
beer
here
but
its
definitely
a
sipper
as
are
most
barley
wines
the
booze
profile
is
nice
and
while
noticeable
it
doesnt
feel
quite
like
10
abv
deep
fruit
flavors
balance
out
the
burn
to
provide
a
nice
heavy
dinner
beer
o
i
have
passed
on
this
beer
time
and
time
again
because
something
has
piqued
my
interest
more
this
time
i
decided
to
snag
up
a
single
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
it
has
a
complex
aroma
with
a
blend
of
sweettart
fruits
and
roasty
malts
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
but
nothing
special
in
my
opinion
overall
i
really
loved
this
barleywine
it
has
kind
of
made
me
think
of
how
much
i
love
the
style
and
should
drink
more
of
them
pick
this
up
if
you
get
the
chance
2011
vintage
poured
into
a
goblet
from
a
bottle
great
color
and
aroma
but
the
taste
was
completely
lacking
all
smell
and
no
flavor
i
was
so
excited
after
i
cracked
the
bottle
open
and
got
that
traditional
barleywine
scent
but
nada
at
least
it
was
only
3
lets
hope
this
beer
is
saved
by
its
taste
wow
no
fruit
deep
molasses
worcestershire
sauce
flavours
different
not
bad
though
not
initially
sold
on
it
either
some
melon
comes
through
over
time
but
the
dichotomy
that
exists
between
your
nose
as
you
inhale
while
you
sip
is
hard
to
overcome
i
will
go
with
a
good
taste
here
lots
of
intricacies
in
the
flavour
and
nose
but
hard
to
drink
it
would
be
like
biting
into
a
beautiful
filet
mignon
and
tasting
smoked
baby
backs
two
things
that
are
good
seperately
but
they
sure
dont
seem
right
together
mouthfeel
is
nice
for
this
style

overall
this
one
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
barleywines
out
there
especially
since
it
keeps
the
nice
malt
flavor
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
these
characteristics
are
likely
due
to
this
being
a
2009
or
2010
bottle
from
their
cellar
2008
vintage
7oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
thanks
brown
and
opaque
with
reddish
highlights
near
the
edges
a
finger
of
tan
froth
lingers
for
a
minute
in
the
nose
i
find
a
blend
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
whisper
of
chocolate
theres
some
brown
sugar
and
earthy
hop
character
on
the
whole
its
well
balanced
and
not
overly
aggressive
as
the
label
states
there
is
a
bit
of
licorice
which
is
an
unusual
attribute
for
the
style
the
malt
profile
is
rich
complex
and
inviting
theres
a
bit
of
umami
character
and
light
oxidation
the
quality
of
the
flavor
mirrors
that
of
the
aroma
though
bitterness
is
a
bit
stronger
than
the
nose
suggests
dark
toffee
blends
with
dried
date
caramel
brown
sugar
and
a
lower
moderate
bitterness
that
attacks
the
back
of
my
tongue
alcohol
is
restrained
considering
its
above
10
the
beer
is
upper
medium
in
body
with
upper
medium
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
sticky
with
pleasant
alcohol
warming
on
the
palate
all
told
a
nice
american
barleywine
that
displays
balance
and
graceful
aging
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
sipping
on
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
good
intentions
but
mediocre
execution
might
be
good
to
cook
with
but
too
much
booze
for
me
to
drink
more
than
once
im
digging
the
hop
presence
thoughcould
use
more
barleywines
with
that
flavor
profile
low
b
overall
a
solid
take
on
the
english
barley
wine
nice
dark
fruit
taste
and
the
subtle
spices
add
a
nice
kick
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
nice
latticework
of
lace
forms
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
malty
with
some
subtle
carameltoffee
aromas
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
and
citrus
zest
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
citrus
zest
bitterness
on
the
palate
that
quickly
fades
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
but
has
a
better
taste
than
smell
in
my
opinion
o
there
are
better
representations
of
the
style
but
despite
its
downsides
this
is
a
good
beer
that
doesnt
break
the
bank
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
it
has
a
solid
complex
flavor
and
a
strong
warm
alcohol
sipping
mouthfeel
its
worth
checking
out
this
brew
is
mediumbodied
with
just
a
light
crispness
that
leads
to
a
rolling
creamy
smoothness
good
balance
and
subtlety
from
flying
dog
which
they
usually
arent
known
for
overall
a
smooth
and
malty
brew
though
the
small
bottles
always
make
me
laugh
but
theyre
a
good
idea
very
murky
brown
with
no
head
but
i
think
the
age
has
killed
it
a
bit
the
smell
isnt
all
that
great
super
dry
grains
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
but
its
just
all
dried
grains
i
bet
fresh
thing
smells
like
caramel
corn
now
the
taste
isnt
that
bad
very
very
sweet
cereal
grains
that
are
dominated
by
caramel
and
toffee
dried
barley
comes
in
a
bit
what
i
see
is
a
glaring
absence
of
roasted
or
toasted
malt
its
definitely
syrupy
sweet
and
probably
was
more
so
in
its
hayday
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
barleywine
and
will
enjoy
this
again
there
is
a
wonderful
balance
and
comlexity
here
and
i
really
enjoy
the
flavors
in
fact
i
love
and
highly
recommend
any
of
the
flying
dog
big
bears
ie
their
dipa
double
dog
and
imperial
porter
gonzo
are
also
huge
robust
beers
and
must
tries
o
this
is
a
killer
barleywine
really
nicely
balanced
very
drinkable
with
the
alcohol
hidden
well
and
most
of
all
tasty
says
vintage
12
cc
on
the
label
but
i
think
its
over
the
hill
already
bought
the
12
oz
bottle
from
best
damn
in
san
diego
moreys
bottom
line
probably
the
most
balanced
barleywine
that
ive
ever
had
they
can
be
too
sweet
too
thin
too
hoppy
medicinal
and
often
times
too
heavy
on
the
alcohol
horn
dog
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
and
you
cant
taste
the
abv
at
all
its
easy
to
see
why
this
one
continues
to
win
medals
this
and
raging
bitch
are
easily
my
two
favorite
beers
from
flying
dog
get
some
nice
beer
ive
had
it
before
but
its
been
awhile
flying
dog
excels
with
bigger
beers
imo
this
might
not
be
their
best
work
or
a
mind
blower
but
its
a
pretty
nice
beer
o
you
would
expect
this
to
be
a
strong
beer
with
all
of
the
malts
but
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
taste
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
i
would
have
no
problem
having
a
few
of
these
even
if
it
came
in
a
larger
bottle
drink
just
okay
maybe
a
fresher
bottle
would
have
been
better
happy
birthday
rachmaninoff
you
would
have
enjoyed
this
o
a
good
beer
not
so
great
paired
with
hotdogs
but
that
was
my
bad
anyway
a
good
offering
from
flying
dog
overall
a
solid
barleywine
but
not
spectacular
i
would
have
another
one
if
it
was
fresher
the
description
mentions
flavors
of
chocolate
and
licorice
are
noticeable
but
i
could
not
sense
any
of
this
id
say
pass
on
this
one
bottom
line
if
you
like
barley
wine
beer
this
one
is
worth
its
price
tag
for
sure
the
body
is
a
little
too
light
for
the
style
and
the
sweetness
is
a
little
cloying
but
the
huge
dark
fruit
notes
are
awesome
and
the
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
are
great
too
very
tasty
with
age
but
maybe
a
little
less
would
provide
some
bitterness
too
bottle
marked
vintage
12aa
two
year
old
properly
cellared
bottle
poured
into
an
ommegang
flute
pours
a
dark
copper
orange
amber
thin
head
slowly
dissipates
into
a
ring
around
the
glass
light
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
dark

definitely
a
barleywine
taste
follows
with
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
well
integrated
finish
is
smooth
but
with
faded
hops
and
a
distinct
alcohol
burn
medium
bodied
hops
i
noted
in
the
earlier
review
are
faded
a
decent
english
stiyle
barleywine
but
this
2
year
old
bottle
has
faded
in
flavor
but
not
mitigated
the
alcohol
flavor
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
fresh
i
wish
flying
dog
had
not
left
the
washington
market
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
overall
pretty
interesting
and
a
good
to
go
barleywine
kind
of
reminded
me
of
rochefort
8
with
amped
up
malt
really
tasty
and
smooth
havent
tried
one
fresh
and
would
be
interested
to
see
what
some
more
hop
character
might
add
i
am
an
irreverent
beer
snob
o
cleverly
suprised
at
how
delicious
and
complex
this
is
great
job
flying
dog
o
a
very
complex
beer
and
with
its
incredible
aromas
and
flavours
finely
balanced
that
you
do
not
want
it
to
end
i
dont
have
any
notes
so
im
going
by
memory
here
i
remember
everything
pretty
much
being
good
and
in
order
with
the
beer
it
was
dark
and
had
nice
head
retention
smelled
and
tasted
like
dark
chocolate
not
the
licorice
like
the
bottle
said
and
had
a
very
nice
feel
to
it
i
definitely
remember
it
being
mild
in
terms
of
other
barleywines
in
every
category
but
that
means
smooth
and
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
at
the
abv
good
beer
no
shit
overall
i
had
this
beer
with
dinner
and
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
it
was
quite
complex
the
finish
reminded
me
of
a
danish
pastry
overall
its
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
definitely
suitable
for
longterm
enjoyment
with
its
high
alcohol
content
i
just
think
it
could
benefit
from
having
a
little
more
complexity
to
keep
it
more
interesting
during
that
time
2009
vintage
poured
into
my
dfh
sniffer
nice
full
14
inch
head
decent
carbination
and
lacing
the
smell
is
very
sweet
fruity
and
mouthwatering
taste
is
very
full
with
lots
of
raisins
figs
and
pears
is
this
really
10
abv
not
hot
at
all
could
drink
this
all
night
long
for
better
or
worse
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
barleywines
that
i
have
tried
flying
dog
brews
some
good
beers
but
this
is
my
favorite
i
have
had
the
2010
and
2011
vintages
but
sitting
in
the
cellar
for
over
two
years
has
really
done
this
brew
good
if
you
see
it
you
should
probably
grab
some
for
now
and
some
for
later
o
very
good
barley
wine
ale
that
doesnt
have
a
really
strong
overpowering
taste
like
some
very
round
somewhat
sweet
caramelmalty
overtone
that
is
smooth
and
great
to
drink
not
sip
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
is
not
very
noticeable
which
is
nice
great
beer
overall
very
impressed
so
far
with
the
few
flying
dog
beers
i
have
tried
overall
this
is
probably
the
oldest
beer
ive
drank
so
far
and
it
has
held
up
very
well
it
was
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
id
like
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
o
3
5
at
first
i
thought
this
might
be
a
homerun
as
the
barleywine
style
seems
to
target
fds
wheelhouse
but
one
bottle
on
a
rare
occassion
is
sufficient
overall
surprisingly
smooth
beer
that
is
very
malty
yet
maintains
enough
balance
to
be
quite
drinkable
d
i
rated
this
against
barleywines
as
a
whole
this
one
was
well
crafted
i
will
be
buying
more
of
these
for
the
upcoming
season
enjoyable
to
the
last
sip
one
of
the
best
flying
dog
offering
i
have
ever
had
again
another
topnotch
brew
from
flying
dog
i
laid
down
the
reminder
of
the
4
pack
in
my
beer
cellar
so
i
should
be
enjoying
this
offering
periodically
for
years
to
come
i
have
been
dieing
to
do
vertical
tasting
notes
on
ba
but
it
doesnt
seem
their
format
supports
it
o
pretty
nice
4
overall
this
is
a
decent
barleywine
having
wellcultivated
flavors
and
a
nice
balance
it
doesnt
necessarily
stretch
the
boundaries
or
surprise
the
tongue
but
it
is
quite
tasty
im
very
pleased
with
this
purchase
i
dont
know
if
this
has
spent
the
past
four
years
on
the
shelf
or
if
it
was
in
a
cooler
either
way
it
has
held
up
as
well
as
anyone
could
hope
in
a
semi
controlled
environment
would
i
pick
this
up
again
sure
would
will
i
find
this
on
the
shelf
for
9
56
with
four
years
on
it
ever
again
probably
not
overall
pretty
decent
beer
i
seem
to
remember
this
being
much
more
boozy
the
last
time
i
had
it
but
with
a
few
years
it
settled
nicely
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
is
probably
my
favorite
from
flying
dog
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
but
it
fits
my
tastes
nicely
thanks
to
the
price
and
accessibility
this
is
one
of
the
relatively
few
beers
that
ive
sought
out
at
the
store
several
times
im
surprised
this
came
out
of
flying
dog
theyre
beers
are
hit
or
miss
for
me
horm
dog
is
a
big
hit
for
me
at
least
with
three
years
on
it
i
wish
this
was
a
12oz
bottle
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
unbalanced
but
not
unpleasant
to
drink
overall
very
decent
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
but
certainly
a
good
value
in
dollars
too
im
not
usually
a
barleywine
person
but
when
i
saw
one
coming
from
a
brewery
as
large
as
flying
dog
and
at
that
price
i
had
to
bite
i
dont
regret
it
its
not
crazy
or
off
the
wall
but
it
does
a
darn
good
job
for
the
style
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
has
ignited
an
interest
in
barleywines
for
me
i
think
ill
age
a
few
and
see
what
happens
this
beer
is
bursting
with
caramel
and
vanilla
the
smell
is
deep
vanilla
and
molasses
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
rich
caramel
flavors
i
was
expecring
it
to
be
rougher
more
like
a
barleywine
but
it
does
agreat
job
of
balancing
that
ballpark
with
smooth
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
not
the
best
barely
wine
out
there
but
a
fairly
good
one
for
the
price
worth
drinking
notes
as
an
introduction
to
this
style
i
am
not
sure
how
good
of
a
beginner
this
one
is
but
i
dont
dislike
it
i
think
the
alcohol
is
masking
a
lot
of
the
sweetness
that
this
style
should
have
and
may
do
very
well
with
age
i
bought
a
four
pack
and
will
be
saving
the
rest
of
them
pours
a
rich
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
as
quickly
as
it
came
very
malty
smell
and
some
chocolate
smells
thick
smokey
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
what
i
gather
to
be
licorice
there
is
a
bit
of
a
hop
note
but
it
is
very
faint
this
is
quite
pungent
as
is
to
be
expected
by
a
barley
wine
style
beer
it
leaves
a
very
smokey
flavor
on
the
palette
and
is
overall
a
very
grainy
concoction
o
i
really
liked
how
dark
and
vinous
this
barleywine
is
it
has
the
doppelbock
and
belgian
dubblequad
qualities
with
the
dark
fruit
esters
brown
sugar
and
licorice
im
not
really
sure
if
the
malt
base
was
lacking
or
that
there
was
enough
sweetness
to
completely
cover
it
up
while
its
memorable
it
didnt
quite
blow
me
away
its
a
really
good
dark
barleywine
that
ill
definitely
be
buying
again
a
fairly
good
barleywine
better
than
most
up
here
in
canada
but
not
really
a
standout
overall
o
awesome
barley
wine
a
nice
sipping
beer
10
alcohol
by
volume
d
great
taste
and
solid
brew
great
body
good
balance
of
flavors
let
it
sit
in
your
mouth
for
a
bit
and
let
the
flavors
coat
your
palate
feel
becomes
very
active
enjoy
slowly
sip
after
sip
the
horn
dog
was
split
with
a
couple
friends
of
mine
none
of
them
liked
it
at
all
i
didnt
find
much
wrong
with
it
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
yellowish
colored
head
the
lacing
was
pretty
thick
at
first
then
it
died
off
the
smell
was
sweet
hoppy
and
had
a
hefty
amount
of
booze
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
sweet
roasted
caramel
and
alcohol
up
front
that
faded
into
a
bitter
hop
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thick
which
is
fine
by
me
the
overall
outlook
i
have
on
this
is
that
its
a
pretty
decent
barley
wine
for
someone
who
hasnt
tried
many
you
could
give
this
one
a
shot
and
see
what
you
think
poured
a
deep
amberbrown
color
with
very
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
fairly
clear
consistency
smelled
of
sour
cherry
and
caramel
tasted
soursweet
in
front
sourness
of
apricot
and
sweetness
of
toffee
with
lots
of
malt
and
hoppy
bitterness
following
strong
booziness
showing
through
mouthfeel
is
medium
weight
finishes
with
a
lingering
biter
booziness
the
high
abv
of
this
beer
is
definitely
apparent
and
there
are
some
bold
tastes
in
this
one
but
overall
its
pretty
enjoyable
not
one
that
i
would
knock
several
back
of
but
a
solid
barleywine
careful
lots
of
alcohol
in
this
one
sweeet
as
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
i
am
shocked
at
how
accessible
this
version
has
been
made
to
be
its
a
great
starter
bw
fisher
price
my
first
bw
only
a
subtle
tinge
of
hops
mostly
malt
alcohol
and
sweeet
poured
rm
temp
into
a
chalice
it
looks
beautiful
the
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
an
18
inch
bit
of
bubbles
on
top
that
stays
there
for
the
rest
of
the
drink
solid
lacing
smells
like
weak
sambuca
weak
on
licorice
not
alcohol
and
cocoa
butter
like
it
says
on
the
bottle
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
a
mainstream
barleywine
unlike
it
says
on
the
bottle
it
is
not
big
or
robust
it
is
tame
on
taste
straightforward
on
complexity
and
sweet
i
mean
its
not
a
sugar
bomb
but
its
sweet
for
the
style
it
tastes
like
liquid
alcoholic
candy
not
a
bad
thing
for
some
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
from
the
makers
of
raging
bitch
maybe
i
should
try
some
at
a
lower
temp
has
a
touch
of
spice
as
it
lingers
in
the
back
of
my
throat
as
a
side
note
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
i
love
the
mouth
feel
could
be
a
session
bw
just
have
to
find
the
right
food
pairings
warms
quickly
watch
out
and
eat
often
next
on
the
list
lagunitas
wtf
and
so
tier
aged
ipa
good
luck
and
good
beer
onot
as
complex
or
robust
a
flavor
as
i
would
have
liked
sweeter
than
what
i
am
used
to
there
are
better
barley
wines
out
theres
as
well
as
better
flying
dogs
such
as
raging
bitch
and
double
dog
ok
a
little
lackluster
compared
to
other
beers
of
the
style
not
bad
overall
i
suppose
overall
i
have
enjoyed
this
very
much
its
really
very
delicious
and
while
the
7oz
size
is
nice
for
a
big
barleywine
i
think
i
would
like
to
have
had
a
few
more
ounces
of
this
by
far
its
the
best
beer
that
ive
had
from
flying
dog
o
this
is
definitely
worth
a
pick
up
if
you
like
barleywine
its
by
far
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
flying
dog
im
impressed
for
sure
id
never
guess
its
a
10
2
beer
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
overall
an
average
or
better
barleywine
overall
very
solid
english
barleywine
despite
some
fairly
good
flavors
overall
it
just
doesnt
come
together
quite
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
while
this
is
quite
enjoyable
there
are
many
other
barleywines
i
would
reach
for
first
or
would
even
rather
have
flying
dog
double
dog
which
has
some
barleywinelike
qualities
another
flying
dog
revisit
though
i
can
barely
even
remember
drinking
it
the
first
time
it
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
biscuit
caramel
light
leek
and
a
generally
mild
mix
of
pine
and
cilantro
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
orange
peel
dark
greens
and
raisins
the
light
spiciness
of
the
greens
doesnt
seem
to
meld
entirely
well
with
the
much
stronger
sweetness
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
chunkyish
feel
overall
a
nice
bwine
though
im
not
sure
the
elements
really
come
together
all
that
successfully
i
dont
dislike
this
beer
but
im
pretty
sure
im
not
gonna
be
seeking
out
very
often
in
the
future

overall
a
pretty
good
barleywine
rich
and
warming
perfect
for
a
winters
evening
recommended
d
my
first
formal
review
of
a
flying
dog
brew
but
probably
my
new
favorite
brew
from
these
guys
maybe
im
just
a
sucker
for
english
barleywines
but
this
one
holds
on
with
the
big
guys
overall
this
is
or
has
peaked
i
think
have
0709
left
to
try
and
will
attempt
to
get
a
2010
but
willing
to
bet
its
going
to
start
its
downhill
turn
soon
o
definitly
a
sipper
and
worth
a
try
abv
well
hidden
glass
is
filled
with
a
nice
dark

thin

head
disappeared
quick
and
left
very
little
lacing
this
beer
smells
of
nice
maltiness
maybe
some
caramel
and
some
dark
fruit
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
i
detect
the
same
flavors
in
the
taste
perhaps
a
touch
of
honey
is
noticed
still
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
but
im
ok
with
that
this
beer
has
a
full
body
and
as
it
warms
only
seems
to
get
thicker
low
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
barley
wine
a
cold
night
sipper
for
sure
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
barley
wine
it
had
all
the
components
i
would
expect
from
an
american
barley
wine
but
since
this
is
classified
as
an
english
barley
wine
i
was
expecting
this
brew
to
be
more
hop
forward
but
it
wasnt
still
a
pretty
good
brew
though
it
hit
the
spot
on
a
cold
snowy
night
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
again
chalk
this
one
up
as
a
hit
flying
dog
impressive
great
beer
not
a
bad
work
from
the
people
at
flying
dog
for
such
a
high
abv
this
brew
does
hide
the
alcohol
very
well
i
kind
of
miss
it
in
this
brew
something
in
this
brew
just
didnt
mix
right
i
might
have
missed
out
on
this
brew
because
i
purchased
about
3
months
ago
so
i
should
have
waited
a
bit
longer
and
it
might
have
given
some
time
to
make
this
brew
better
again
it
wasnt
a
bad
brew
it
just
seemed
to
lack
that
traditional
barleywine
burn
i
think
i
might
pick
up
another
one
and
let
it
condition
a
bit
longer
otherwise
a
decent
brew
i
like
that
this
was
in
a
7
oz
made
it
much
easier
to
finish
i
think
12
oz
would
have
been
a
lot
nice
simple
barleywine
d
really
the
207
ml
bottle
is
almost
perfect
in
a
way
could
do
two
of
the
207s
in
a
sitting
and
push
the
limit
a
bit
or
stay
with
one
and
just
plain
enjoy
it
it
is
a
slow
sipper
and
would
go
very
well
with
cheese
to
end
the
night
very
well
hidden
abv
to
this
due
to
the
age
is
is
in
very
good
condition
right
now
and
the
fruits
will
keep
developing
even
more
note
more
and
more
i
think
the
tasting
pack
is
pretty
good
value
paid
23
for
it
in
sydney
get
3
good
beers
in
the
double
pale
imperial
porter
and
the
barley
wine
triple
is
pretty
forgettable
this
beer
is
huge
id
throw
it
up
against
some
creamy
goat
cheese
and
see
how
it
holds
up
absolutely
fantastic
and
my
hats
off
the
the
guys
at
flying
dog
definitely
englishstyle
in
that
its
smaller
than
some
dipas
maharajah
comes
to
mind
and
malt
forward
not
especially
hot
but
then
again
also
not
flavorful
enough
to
justify
the
abv

to
bucketboy

throwing
this

printed
on

pours
a
hazy
brownish
plum
with
a
loose
offwhite
head
that
quickly
disperses
towards
the
shoulders
forming
a
bubbly
band
some
spots
of
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
huge
malt
bomb
of
a
nose
figs
prunes
molasses
brown
sugar
and
a
distinct
bready
quality
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
a
slight
candied
quality
also
comes
out
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
mild
carbonation
a
dangerously
drinkable
barelywine
at

virtually
no
trace
of
alcohol
here
good
thing
it
comes
in
small
bottles
one
of
my
favorites
hands
down
from
this
brewer
id
recommend
it
and
i
can
only
see
it
getting
better
with
age
d
nice
little
english
barleywine
nothing
too
special
but
a
solid
barleywine
thats
great
on
a
cold
night
mouthfeel
is
really
really
slick
but
i
think
it
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
carbonation
not
really
being
there
this
probably
has
something
to
do
with
it
being
old
knowing
that
this
is
an
english
barleywine
i
expected
it
to
be
less
hoppy
but
to
my
taste
a
little
dose
of
hops
would
have
gone
a
long
way
in
balancing
out
this
sweet
malt
monster
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
hophead
tastebuds
dvery
solid
barleywine
i
have
had
better
not
sessionable
only
share
with
fellow
beer
geekssnobs
i
think
many
novice
beer
drinkers
would
be
turned
off
by
the
big
alcohol
malt
taste
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
price
and
fits
my
craving
for
an
english
style
bw
i
would
like
to
see
better
bittering
more
aging
and
more
head
retention
dgood
representation
of
an
english
barleywine
but
not
my
favorite

much
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
to
buy
again
12
ounce
bottle
vintage
08cc
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brownorange
color
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
boozy
but
also
a
bit
weak
it
smells
like
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
figs
and
booze
it
tastes
like
caramel
sweet
malt
figs
booze
and
some
hops
alcohol
heat
is
noticable
in
the
taste
the
beer
also
has
a
bitter
finish
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
sweeter
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
syrupy
and
has
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
think
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
but
i
wouldnt
drink
this
very
often
personally
i
am
not
thrilled
with
this
but
can
not
say
its
a
bad
beer
for
10
it
hides
it
very
well
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
dark
ruby
red
with
one
finger
of
tan
head
smell
was
malty
with
a
light
dark
fruit
presence
taste
is
slightly
raisin
in
nature
with
a
very
malty
backbone
feel
is
smooth
but
crisp
with
a
medium
to
full
body
overall
an
enjoyable
barley
wine
that
i
will
not
turn
down
poured
into
a
snifter
the
color
is
a
moderate
copper
with
a
slight
white
head
that
fades
away
quite
quickly
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
sweetened
malt
light
fruits
cherries
and
moderate
caramel
a
bit
of
booze
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
caramel
with
mild
fruit
and
booze
feel
is
big
enough
to
handle
a
good
dose
of
alcohol
drinks
well
enough
but
needs
some
age
to
really
shine
d
barleywine
is
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
i
liked
this
one
sweet
without
being
sickening
alcoholic
without
being
retch
inducing
with
fruity
notes
that
were
fresh
and
refreshing
i
will
keep
this
one
in
mind
if
ever
i
fancy
a
barleywine
rich
velvety
mouthfeel
very
very
drinkable
d
i
really
wasnt
expecting
this
age
has
created
a
masterpiece
out
of
this
one
a
bit
of
booze
in
the
nose
but
not
really
at
all
in
the
mouth
immense
complexity
and
the
silkiest
smooth
mouthfeel
that
ive
come
across
in
a
long
while
buy
a
case
of
this
one
fresh
and
sit
on
it
an
amazing
beer
i
like
this
beer
and
appreciate
flying
dog
taking
a
crack
at
the
english
version
of
this
big
style
my
first
review
here
goes
it
pours
a
rich
copper
color
i
get
a
good
bit
of
maltiness
in
the
smell
but
its
not
overwhelming
the
taste
is
a
good
amount
of
fruit
and
some
alcohol
this
brew
has
a
very
rich
yet
complex
taste
that
takes
a
few
minutes
to
really
wrap
my
head
around
the
mouth
feel
isnt
as
heavy
as
i
was
expecting
the
horn
dog
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
fabulous
beer
for
the
price
very
very
nice
pours
a
dark
coppery
body
with
a
medium
shortlived
offwhite
head
aroma
is
licorice
and
fruity
like
raspberries
strawberries
and
hints
of
pine
taste
is
similar
to
sierra
nevada
lots
of
licoricecoughsyrupy
flavors
with
fruity
and
piney
elements
scattered
around
complex
and
nice
just
like
a
barley
wine
is
supposed
to
be
i
applaud
this
effort
great
low
creamy
carbonation
d
for
10
2
abv
this
is
a
very
smooth
drink
there
is
almost
no
hint
of
alcohol
a
very
good
quality
barleywine
very
smooth
but
that
could
be
due
to
the
slight
aging
drinkability
smooth
drinking
is
diminished
somewhat
by
a
high
alcohol
flavor
and
dryness
still
its
not
a
bad
beer
i
could
drink
one
or
two
of
these
beer
poured
a
hazy
reddishbrown
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
has
dissapated
nose
is
sweet
bread
and
candy
and
some
northwest
hops
taste
is
very
unbalanced
to
the
sweet
side
red
licorice
dominates
with
some
chocolate
lingering
in
the
background
not
enough
hops
to
balance
this
sweet
malt
bomb
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
smooth
across
the
palate
drinkability
is
ok
definitely
a
sipper
not
a
bad
beer
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
overall
a
very
pleasant
offering
to
be
honest
this
is
my
first
barleywine
but
after
tasting
flying
dogs
version
i
am
more
than
willing
to
try
more
this
pours
a
deep
cooper
pretty
opaque
or
at
least
it
seems
so
in
my
notverybright
room
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
bready
with
a
subtle
sweet
note
not
as
overbearing
as
some
other
malty
brews
in
the
mouth
its
slightly
sweet
with
a
good
deal
of
booze
and
some
woody
notes
its
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
at
this
alcohol
level
you
might
not
be
drinking
many
of
these
but
i
could
put
back
two
without
it
overpowering
the
palate
good
beer
my
third
of
the
canis
major
series
and
to
me
not
as
good
as
the
imperial
porter
or
the
dipa
but
a
good
beer
nevertheless
an
average
bw
drinkability
high
for
a
10
50
beer
goes
down
easy
wellbalanced
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
notes
my
wife
the
hophead
took
a
sip
and
shuddered
saying
gross
md
mouthfeel
is
very
think
and
the
heat
from
the
alcohol
is
apparent
this
is
a
reasonably
drinkable
barleywine
but
because
i
can
only
get
this
in
an
8
oz
bottle
and
its
pretty
average
for
a
style
with
some
real
standouts
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again
d
you
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
but
it
is
a
barleywine
with
a
high
abv
it
is
very
good
and
i
think
it
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
barleywine
style
d
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
barleywine
i
could
see
how
the
alcohol
abv
and
taste
might
turn
some
off
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
probably
pick
some
up
again
given
the
chance
d
eh
i
wouldnt
go
for
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
and
unique
brew
i
havent
tried
too
many
barley
wines
but
i
wouldnt
go
as
far
to
call
this
drinkable
a
sticky
mouthful
of
chocolatey
malt
liqorice
molasses
and
sweet
alcohol
honey
im
really
enjoying
this
alcohol
starts
to
show
itself
after
a
while
but
this
is
delish
dessert
winelike
in
its
decadence
dip
me
in
honey
and
throw
to
the
lesbians
and
ill
be
a
happy
man
d
probably
keep
it
at
one
very
smooth
character
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
but
its
definitely
there
huge
malt
with
moderate
chocolate
flavors
the
bottle
says
vintage
09
on
the
bar
code
so
im
assuming
its
from
09
ill
keep
a
few
around
for
a
another
year
or
so
d
at
10
2
alcohol
its
scary
how
easily
this
goes
down
delicious
but
not
the
best
barley
wine
ive
ever
tasted
an
amazing
beer
right
here
had
this
with
a
couple
of
steaks
honey
is
youre
key
word
here
it
tastes
like
downing
a
stick
of
solid
honey
very
strong
alcohol
taste
to
be
prepared
for
it
and
thick
taste
so
know
it
wont
be
fading
away
soon
ask
neighbors
to
get
used
to
it
so
you
can
have
a
few
to
yourself
md
sweet
and
huge
but
surprisingly
not
as
heavy
or
cloying
as
expected
this
is
a
huge
beer
but
it
lacks
the
huge
syrupy
filling
feeling
that
others
like
it
usually
have
extremely
drinkable
for
such
a
huge
barleywine
goes
down
very
easily
this
one
will
catch
up
with
you
quick
very
welldone
im
really
impressed
d
a
flying
dog
variety
pack
was
one
of
the
most
disappointing
purchases
in
recent
memories
but
this
beer
has
changed
my
mind
about
the
brewery
i
really
enjoyed
it
very
sweet
too
much
for
me
to
drink
often
but
on
the
plus
side
it
completely
conceals
the
alcohol
content
d
for
a
10
2
abv
beer
this
is
extremely
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
this
was
my
first
barley
wine
dark
colored
i
could
barely
see
through
the
bottle
holding
it
up
to
the
light
could
feel
the
abv

the
way
down
slightly
dry
in
the
mouth

overall
great
flavor

and

overall
not
something
i
would
necessarily
seek
out
again
what
a

sticky
beer
this
is
but
thankfully
there
is
enough
hop
flavour
and
bitterness
to
balance
a
highly
enjoyable
barleywine
for
me
if
not
outstanding
drinks
ok
but
the
warmth
overwhelms
the
flavors
and
makes
this
pretty
much
a
one
and
done
at
this
point
not
bad
but
not
one
to
really
seek
out

a

and
good
interpretation
of
the
style
d
very
nice
but
not
sure
how
often
id
revisit
with
the
alcohol
smell
and
aftertaste
so
i
give
it
a
slightly
above
average
drinkability
d
a
hefty
barley
wine
on
the
label
that
doesnt
have
the
feel
of
a
10
5
heavyweight
flavor
is
still
good
but
not
amazing
whatsoever
a
bit
of
a
disappoint
though
drinkable
enough
albeit
not
impressing
to
the
point
that
id
choose
to
run
out
and
buy
more

the
cellar
maybe
better
fresher

grape

not
a

lots
of
malt
presence
in
this
tasting
of
a
buttery
toffee
theres
also
a
dark
fruit
taste
it
has
a
slightly
viscous
feel
and
a
surprisingly
clean
finish
im
generally
a
hophead
but
i
found
the
subdued
hopping
of
this
beer
to
work
very
well
horn
dog
is
a
decent
barley
wine
especially
if
you
dont
like
it
overly
malted
its
sweet
and
has
some
good
flavor
but
its
mostly
fairly
subdued
it
has
very
little
spice
flavor
if
any
but
it
had
a
good
hop
flavor
with
the
finish
not
a
bad
barleywine
and
perhaps
since
this
is
listed
as
an
english
barleywine
im
just
not
familiar
with
the
difference
dark
ruby
red
pour
with
a
1cm
off
white
head
it
smells
like
a
wine
with
hints
of
licorice
and
alcohol
i
was
surprised
to
find
some
cocoa
and
coffee
flavors
along
with
the
licorice
and
alcohol
in
this
beer
in
addition
to
these
flavors
there
was
also
a
lot
of
fruityness
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
a
slight
carbonation
this
beer
is
not
greatly
drinkable
due
mostly
to
the
high
alcohol
content
which
is
pretty
apparent
overall
unremarkable
but
competent
beer
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
sweeter
barleywine
the
american
versions
often
tend
to
make
a
superstrong
ipa
as
their
topabv
brew
and
label
it
a
barleywine
but
this
is
really
coming
in
strong
from
the
malt
side
of
things
leaving
a
smooth
sticky
sweet
and
undeniably
winelike
barleywine
i
approve
heartily
its
certainly
far
from
terrible
but
has
a
ways
to
go
before
it
hits
great
d
im
gonna
say
good
cause
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
enjoy
the
ones
like
this
one
that
arent
off
or
too
hoppy
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
ones
overall
a
pretty
darn
decent
barley
wine
that
i
suspect
would
improve
greatly
with
age
overall
horn
dog
is
a
smooth
example
of
an
english
barleywine
but
not
as
bold
as
id
hoped
regardless
its
a
very
enjoyable
brew
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
given
the
opportunity
yum
a
really
nice
barleywine
sure
i
love
the
highly
hopped
american
types
but
this
sort
of
hybrid
englishamerican
barleywine
is
great
drinkability
ah
drinkability
i
enjoy
drinking
this
i
really
do
but
barley
wines
arent
really
my
thing
so
i
feel
unworthy
to
judge
this
i
will
say
this
is
my
favorite
barley
wine
and
id
probably
drink
more
than
one
a
given
drinking
night
if
i
had
more
than
one
drinkability
was
good
could
down
acouple
of
these
in
a
session
not
the
best
in
its
style
but
one
of
the
cheapest
and
worth
cellaring
for
acouple
years
down
the
road
d
like
barleywines
and
i
think
this
one
stayed
true
to
its
style
i
enjoyed
it
a
dark
brown
with
a
deep
ruby
hue
a
solid
finger
of
thick
mildly
creamy
head
crystal
clear
and
with
some
visible
viscosity
especially
with
a
swirl
of
the
glass
4
25
s
lots
of
dark
fruit
aromas
signs
of
prune
and
dark
raisin
thick
molasses
like
sweetness
there
are
also
some
syrupy
aromas
that
remind
me
of
fruit
cake
dough
alcohol
is
evident
but
doesnt
overpower
some
slightly
spicy
aromas
are
evident
4

t
very
sweet
from
a
heavy
malt
base
but
balanced
with
a
solid
hop
bite
the
tail
end
of
the
beer
is
packed
with
a
spicy
hop
bite
like
the
nose
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
disruptive
some
brown
sugars
and
rum
soaked
dates

d
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
barley
wine
one
i
would
drink
again
4
50
d
overall
one
of
the
better
barleywines
on
the
market
in
my
opinion
very
tasty
highly
recommended
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
carbonated
a
little
warm
a
tad
astringent
and
creamy
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
full
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
a
good
english
barleywine
has
a
lot
of
complex
flavor
and
depth
im
assuming
this
is
2009
vintage
as
i
have
never
seen
it
in
these
parts
pours
into
the
tulip
a
nice
dark
red
with
mahogany
hues
head
is
large
from
a
semiaggressive
pour
recedes
slowly
into
a
thick
ring
round
the
entire
glass
nice
lacing
present
though
it
slowly
sinks
down
into
the
brew
smell
on
this
is
a
bit
on
the
alcoholic
side
very
malty
and
sweet
scent
surely
not
something
im
used
to
but
is
not
entirely
unpleasant
taste
is
strange
on
this
one
has
a
sort
of
bittersweetness
to
it
followed
up
swiftly
with
an
alcoholic
overtone
i
suppose
there
could
be
hints
of
chocolate
and
black
licorice
though
it
is
difficult
for
my
palate
to
discern
horn
dog
has
a
surprisingly
light
feel
about
it
for
such
a
heavy
brew
just
right
with
the
carbonation
has
a
slick
feel
that
goes
down
maybe
too
easily
good
drinkability
for
a
good
brew
drinkability
not
one
of
the
more
bombastic
english
barleywines
but
still
drinkable
id
like
to
get
this
on
tap
if
possible
to
see
if
theres
any
difference
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
this
beer
should
be
drank
now
dont
bother
aging
it
probably
wouldnt
do
much
good
overall
a
good
ebw
that
i
recommend
only
had
4
in
this
style
and
this
would
be
in
middle
tier
for
me
as
that
while
it
was
good
it
didnt
really
jump
up
and
say
drink
more
of
me
availrot
available
here
in
tx
might
get
the
rare
single
every
few
years
to
try
on
d
i
like
a
few
of
flying
dogs
beers
and
this
one
isnt
one
of
them
i
would
have
much
rather
enjoyed
the
gonzo
again
even
though
compared
to
this
this
the
gonzo
was
watery
overall
this
is
a
very
good
barleywine
it
is
quite
complex
and
delicious
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
of
this
another
solid
offering
from
flying
dog
i
recall
not
particularly
liking
this
beer
when
it
was
fresh
to
that
end
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
much
more
enjoyable
there
is
definitely
marked
improvement
with
a
year
or
so
of
age
its
also
one
to
be
sipped
pours
a
clear
brownredorange
with
thin
offwhite
head
smell
lots
of
caramel
dates
black
cherry
in
a
cherry
coke
kind
of
way
taste
lots
of
caramel
a
little
pumpernickel
again
some
of
that
notequiteright
cherry
active
but
soft
carbonation
alcohol
is
a
player
but
not
upfront
kind
of
a
middling
barleywine
from
what
seemed
to
be
a
bit
of
a
beast
on
the
nose
died
out
into
a
lame
kitten
when
it
came
to
the
taste
i
was
hoping
this
would
bite
me
on
the
nose
as
i
sipped
it
but
it
quietly
miaowed
and
slid
away
frightened
definitely
the
wateriest
barleywine
i
have
ever
encountered
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
than
this
and
was
really
deflated
by
it
i
have
another
7
different
beers
from
flying
dog
to
go
at
i
hope
they
perform
better
than
this
did
i
honestly
cannot
call
this
a
sipping
beer
d
the
tastes
is
pretty
damn
good
nothing
spectacular
but
a
good
easy
to
find
barleywine
solid
i
had
low
expectations
going
into
this
one
hadnt
heard
great
things
picked
up
a
single
on
closeout
exceeded
my
initial
expectations
particularly
the
aroma
the
booziness
is
the
biggest
problem
right
now
but
i
might
buy
another
to
see
what
some
age
would
do
its
super
drinkable
in
my
opinion
a
sweet
smooth
brew
with
a
nice
little
bit
added
in
that
reminds
me
of
whiskey
if
it
wasnt
over
10
i
would
call
it
a
session
beer
for
sure
and
i
guess
if
youre
chuck
norris
you
could
call
it
that
but
seriously
i
think
2
of
these
would
get
me
buzzin
pretty
well
this
probably
takes
a
hit
for
me
not
being
a
barleywine
connoisseur
but
still
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
horn
dog
is
a
solid
english
barleywine
i
enjoyed
it
though
i
think
it
would
surely
be
better
with
a
couple
years
on
it
d
the
alcohol
starts
to
hit
you
after
the
first
5
sips
or
so
a
fairly
hot
beer
very
enjoyable
and
will
have
to
cellar
one
to
see
how
the
heat
cools
off
d
overall
i
do
enjoy
it
but
the
alcohol
is
slightly
overwhelming
i
hope
to
keep
some
for
a
few
years
and
see
how
it
mellows
d
pretty
drinkable
its
a
big
beer
with
big
flavor
so
one
is
probably
about
as
far
as
i
would
go
all
in
all
this
ended
up
being
an
interesting
brew
glad
i
got
to
try
it
unique
flavors
with
a
hint
too
overbearing
good
to
try
whether
you
like
hops
or
matls
when
i
opened
my
minibottle
i
found
this
brew
to
have
a
very
heavy
nose
that
comes
off
very
sweet
its
a
semicloudy
medium
brown
color
with
medium
carbonation
the
body
is
heavy
and
thick
reminiscent
of
a
port
wine
the
flavor
is
earthy
and
sweet
i
cant
really
pick
apart
what
specific
flavors
are
in
there
but
it
is
fantastic
it
finishes
with
a
small
amount
of
tartness
mintongue
but
smooth
over
the
rest
weird
but
i
like
it
its
bold
and
doesnt
hold
back
ill
definitely
go
for
this
one
again
a
nice
full
body
on
the
mouth
and
light
carbonation
make
for
a
very
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
drink
over
and
over
again
this
brew
pours
a
dark
cherry
almost
mahogany
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
half
finger
alcohol
laced
looking
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lacingthe
aroma
is
raisinssweet
caramelwhite
port
and
boozy
alcoholit
has
a
sweet
syrupy
mouthfeel
which
is
to
be
expected
for
this
style
almost
like
a
fine
port
with
more
carbonation
and
has
nice
interesting
tastes
of
caramelportmocha
and
raisins
soaked
in
alcoholeven
tho
i
couldnt
drink
this
all
night
and
wouldnt
start
with
it
i
will
easily
finish
this
bottle
and
it
really
is
a
great
way
to
end
a
night
as
a
nightcap
and
thats
coming
from
a
man
who
doesnt
particulary
like
his
barleywines
be
it
english
or
american
but
then
again
maybe
i
just
havnt
tried
the
right
ones
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
chocolate
fruits
and
alcohol
taste
like
it
smells
chocolate
and
alcohol
with
some
fruits
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
d
good
drink
alcohol
is
not
too
prominent
d
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
and
widely
palatable
i
am
mad
at
myself
for
sleeping
on
this
one
for
so
long
smell
is
hard
to
make
out
but
from
what
i
can
sugary
sweet
and
somewhat
acidic
taste
is
mellow
and
sweet
somewhat
buttery
really
without
any
harsh
characteristics
some
hints
of
caramel
apple
and
pear
extremely
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
d
a
very
nice
sipping
english
style
barley
wine
at
10
2
abv
warming
sweet
with
a
nice
assertive
hop
balance
lots
of
earthy
smoky
sweet
malt
flavors
take
the
stage
here
and
leave
a
smooth
mellow
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
could
sip
a
couple
and
watch
the
snow
fall
for
a
couple
hours
for
sure
a
nice
brew
from
flying
dog
medium
body
with
a
cloying
sweetness
and
alcohol
astringency
a
solid
barleywine
for
the
most
part
but
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
heat
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
this
beer
smells
like
pear
and
cherry
ive
never
smelled
pear
in
a
beer
before
it
has
strong
esters
sweet
red
and
dark
fruit
flavors
vanilla
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
without
much
hop
aroma
or
flavor
it
tastes
like
its
aged
on
oak
but
it
doesnt
say
anything
about
that
on
the
bottle
im
not
good
at
reviews
this
being
my
first
i
bought
this
beer
had
1
and
went
back
to
buy
the
rest
this
beer
will
blow
you
away
ive
had
better
beers
than
this
but
for
the
value
and
taste
this
beer
will
be
in
my
fridge
as
long
as
it
is
available
pretty
good
for
the
style
but
overall
i
could
probably
drink
three
bigfoot
to
one
of
these
a
pleasant
warm
sipper
built
to
share
d
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
it
was
in
the
delirium
café
in
belgium
and
ive
underestimated
its
drinkability
as
a
matter
of
fact
today
in
the
comfort
of
home
i
feel
like
i
could
easily
drink
more
2
bottles
before
falling
down
a
great
beer
during
cold
weather
nice
and
sweetwonderful
smellhigh
drinkability
to
me
the
best
beer
from
flying
dog
brewery
reminds
me
of
imperial
style
beers
such
as
the
strong
stouts
out
there
a
good
beer
to
finish
your
beer
session
with
i
like
it
with
bbq
priced
well
if
your
on
a
budget
the
recession
barley
wine
notes
while
not
extraordinary
it
is
a
good
barleywine
and
always
pleasing
to
have
it
has
the
overtly
highlighted
boozy
profile
of
most
of
the
canis
major
series
but
again
does
impact
negatively
the
brew
nice
work
pours
with
a
dark
red
color
and
a
nice
creamy
head
smells
like
a
hoppy
barleywine
with
hints
of
fruits
taste
is
a
very
nice
blend
of
all
the
ingredients
with
a
high
alcohol
content
i
could
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
but
it
didnt
bother
me
at
all
a
smooth
beer
all
in
all
definitely
worth
a
try
ive
been
on
a
strange
barleywine
kick
lately
and
this
is
one
that
i
picked
up
poured
from
bottle
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
redbrown
closer
to
red
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
quickly
smells
of
alcohol
fruitiness
strong
malt
and
a
little
hops
taste
follows
the
nose
definite
booze
taste
especially
right
on
the
tongue
followed
by
malt
fruit
caramel
and
hops
malt
doesnt
seem
to
be
balanced
by
hops
packs
an
alcohol
kick
that
you
can
feel
as
every
barleywine
should
low
to
moderate
carbonation
almost
creamy
this
is
a
slow
sipper
not
anything
you
should
be
spending
the
whole
night
drinking
pours
dark
brown
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
strong
caramel
with
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
this
one
smells
boozy
the
flavor
is
lots
of
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
pretty
hot
and
is
warming
low
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
a
good
english
barleywine
medium
to
heavy
body
thick
sticky
mouthfeel
not
too
bad
for
10
but
prolly
couldnt
stomach
too
much
of
this
kinda
wish
i
had
more
than
7oz
though
a
nice
example
of
the
style
nothing
too
too
amazing
though
d
this
was
my
first
english
barleywine
but
i
definitely
enjoy
the
style
very
nice
drink
which
does
a
good
job
at
concealing
the
high
alcohol
content
sweetness
isnt
overpowering
but
definitely
there
d
a
great
brew
to
sip
away
just
beware
of
the
abv
drinkability
is
good
for
a
10
beer
just
wish
the
sold
it
in
6
packs
for
the
same
price
pours
a
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
rapidly
before
disappearing
entirely
no
lacing
nose
is
loaded
with
dark
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruits
extreme
strong
aroma
taste
brings
the
same
loaded
with
malts
strong
tartbitterness
astringent
and
strong
alcohol
burn
a
bit
vinuous
as
well
the
10
5
abv
is
hidden
about
as
well
as
brett
favres
ego
drinkability
is
moderate
d
the
taste
hurts
this
imo
a
brutal
intro
to
the
style
overall
horn
dog
barley
wine
style
ale
is
pretty
interesting
and
pretty
tasty
probably
my
favorite
flying
dog
beer
that
ive
had
so
far
i
kinda
want
to
drink
another
one
but
the
abv
might
be
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
still
in
all
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
me
drink
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
first
time
i
had
arrogant
bastard
im
in
mild
shock
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
know
someone
who
bashes
beer
because
their
only
knowledge
is
based
off
of
macros
this
would
be
a
fun
be
beer
to
give
them
like
i
said
earlier
this
has
been
my
first
barley
wine
ive
had
a
good
time
drinking
this
brew
and
hence
its
a
style
i
will
pursue
certainly
a
sipper
but
pretty
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
i
prefer
my
barleywines
a
little
hoppier
but
this
is
a
respectable
beer
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
another
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
gonzo
mouthfeel
is
on
the
medium
side
prickly
in
the
initial
sip
the
quickly
evolves
into
a
smooth
finish
its
very
sweet
so
considering
drinkability
meh
im
enjoying
this
beer
but
maybe
two
at
the
most
in
one
sitting
id
like
to
have
more
action
in
the
aroma
but
definitely
worth
checking
out
though
d
a
good
sipper
and
a
pretty
good
barleywine
imo
its
still
pretty
sweet
though
which
would
discourage
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
plus
its
10
5
abv
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
barleywine
i
might
try
this
again
it
would
also
probably
be
good
with
a
year
or
two
on
it
alcohol
tolerance
and
ability
to
see
past
cough
medicine
flavor
are
your
factors
in
drink
many
of
these
the
high
abv
along
with
the
hoppiness
knock
down
the
overall
score
just
a
bit
its
tasty
and
drinkable
but
you
wouldnt
find
yourself
throwing
back
a
six
pack
in
a
single
sitting
though
taste
is
a
little
darker
than
most
barleywines
hop
presence
is
relatively
absent
tastes
more
like
a
strong
ale
british
style
but
i
guess
this
is
an
english
barleywine
so
it
kind
of
fits
the
bill
sometimes
the
sweetness
does
a
good
hide
on
the
alcohol
and
you
can
enjoy
the
beer
to
a
degree
not
as
explosive
in
flavor
as
other
barleywines
but
it
does
still
provide
that
warming
feel
that
we
all
love
thanks
bobsy
drinkability
for
me
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
favorite
style
and
affordable
i
think
i
almost
liked
this
more
fresh
when
it
had
some
sort
of
hop
bitterness
attached
to
it
but
for
an
english
barleywine
this
is
where
it
should
be
maybe
i
just
prefer
the
american
version
dont
drink
and
review
vintage
bottled
in
2008
wow
ive
got
to
admit
horn
dog
is
shockingly
good
ive
sat
on
this
bottle
for
quite
some
time
frankly
because
i
wasnt
looking
forward
to
it
much
color
me
surprised
at
how
good
this
is
i
think
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
might
improve
it
but
thats
my
taste
i
like
hoppy
barleywines
nonetheless
this
is
very
good
stuff
its
easily
the
best
flying
dog
beer
ive
had
to
date
impressive
stuff
thats
definitely
recommended
d
ok
a
sipper
barley
wine
would
pass
on
trying
it
again
overall
a
pretty
good
barleywine
rich
and
warming
perfect
for
a
winters
evening
recommended
mouthfeel
is
less
abrasive
and
beer
is
much
easier
drinking
with
age
a
middling
barleywine
when
fresh
quite
enjoyable
with
age
made
a
good
appearance
poured
a
cloudy
milk
chocolate
brown
with
a
small
foamy
head
that
settled
into
a
thin
bubbly
lacing
moderate
carbonation
had
a
nose
of
caramel
and
butter
spicy
alcohol
and
ripe
date
and
fig
fruity
a
smooth
full
bodied
mouth
feel
good
drinkability
big
malty
taste
caramelized
and
a
little
sour
bready
spicy
subtle
alcohol
fig
fruity
a
mild
hop
bite
and
a
spicy
grainy
and
alcohol
warm
finish
excellent
beer
this
was
a
beautifullooking
barleywine
and
because
of
that
i
was
slightly
more
disappointed
than
i
might
have
been
when
i
tasted
the
brew
alcohol
was
very
present
with
slight
hints
of
whiskey
pretty
typical
barleywine
flavors
here
minus
the
complexity
i
was
hoping
for
drank
it
on
an
empty
stomach
and
felt
the
burn
go
get
some
of
this
this
is
quite
a
delicious
barley
wine
horn
dog
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
golden
hue
on
the
edges
with
an
off
white
head
the
nose
contains
dark
cherries
carmelized
brown
sugar
ripe
banana
maple
syrup
and
figs
this
beer
has
a
creamy
thick
mouth
feel
and
on
the
palate
appears
to
have
flavors
of
candied
walnuts
vanilla
bean
creme
brulee
with
carmelized
brown
sugar
figs
currants
old
fruit
and
a
light
lingering
tartness
and
bitterness
that
resembles
coffee
aftertaste
horn
dog
is
a
sipper
but
thoroughly
drinkable
did
i
mention
dark
fruits
looks
like
i
did
not
but
as
it
warms
up
the
beer
sings
some
tunes
of
raisan
plum
subtle
cherry
semi
sweet
red
wineport
and
fig
drinkability
high
beer
is
well
balaned
it
is
really
sweet
but
the
bitterness
cuts
this
well
there
is
a
lot
of
midpalate
connectivity
with
this
beer
im
loving
it
mouthfeel
is
good
and
full
bodied
overall
pretty
good
but
not
great
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
liked
it
better
thought
it
was
more
flavorful

not
regularly
otherwise
id
be
an
alcoholic
would
definitely
have
again
though
drinkability
if
this
beer
was
a
bit
lower
in
alcohol
or
a
bit
bigger
in
body
with
the
tobacco
spicey
presence
toned
down
a
bit
then
i
could
seriously
see
myself
getting
into
it
however
this
is
a
definitely
will
not
buy
again
for
me
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
didnt
like
it
either
taste
is
so
nice
again
port
like
great
sipper
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
extremely
dark
brown
in
color
small
head
but
it
stands
up
big
malty
smell
im
not
extremely
strong
on
pulling
out
different
malts
yet
big
big
flavorful
beer
thick
and
chewy
in
my
mouth
with
lots
of
malts
and
some
sweetness
just
a
touch
hot
from
alcohol
but
at
10
2
its
hidden
pretty
well
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
d
low
drinkability
the
bitterness
is
powerful
and
limiting
and
the
alcohol
sears
the
throat
for
a
beer
d
little
too
sweet
syrupy
for
me
seems
offbalanced
with
the
alcohol
notes
overpowering
everything
else
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
one
but
probably
wont
buy
again
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
again
the
warming
feeling
is
just
part
of
the
great
feel
of
this
beer
not
your
average
beer
it
is
quite
high
in
the
abv
but
still
easy
drinking
for
a
strong
beer
d
the
complexity
of
flavours
is
nice
but
its
to
sweet
for
my
liking
easy
to
drink
since
the
alcohol
content
is
not
noticeable
pours
a
hazy
brownish
orange
thin
off
white
head
forms
settles
down
to
a
thin
ring
and
leaves
a
few
spots
on
the
glass
smell
is
nice
big
and
boozy
quite
sweet
malty
brown
sugar
caramel
raisins
very
fruity
cherries
sherry
earthy
a
bit
woody
alcohol
almost
belgianesque
taste
is
similar
very
sweet
and
malty
toffee
lots
of
sweet
fruit
raisin
leather
and
tobacco
brown
sugar
alcohol
grapes
a
bit
sugary
decent
balance
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
some
heat
going
down
pretty
decent
barleywine
throws
off
a
lot
of
fruit
for
the
style
horn
dog
is
an
odd
beer
it
has
a
bananalike
flavor
which
as
it
warms
morphs
into
bubblegum
very
much
like
i
find
in
abt
12
the
smell
is
like
a
bsda
belgian
yeast
and
all
are
my
senses
just
being
weird
today
probably
did
i
enjoy
it
to
the
extent
that
i
can
tolerate
bubblegum
flavors
drinkability
is
higher
than
id
expect
for
a
10
2
barleywine
i
could
see
having
a
couple
bottles
of
this
one
and
then
falling
over
if
i
tried
to
get
up
quite
tasty
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
the
barrelaged
version
first
impression
is
of
the
higher
than
typical
hop
bite
on
the
initial
taste
the
overall
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
high
level
of
alcohol
the
post
swallow
taste
is
sweet
and
warming
wellbalanced
for
a
barley
wine
this
is
a
rich
beer
that
has
enough
carbonation
to
prevent
it
from
tasting
similarly
to
a
port
12
oz
a
short
yet
thick
and
creamy
tan
colored
head
formed
with
a
dark
dark
amber
beer
hue
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
syrup
first
then
a
hint
of
hops
sneaks
in
the
taste
is
full
sweet
malt
flavor
of
toffeecaramel
ish
followed
by
a
moderate
bitterness
that
lingers
into
the
dry
finish
it
seems
to
start
off
with
a
classic
english
barelywine
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
more
american
barelywine
hop
influence
a
good
barelywine
id
personally
prefer
a
bit
more
hops
but
thats
just
me
eh
pours
a
clowdy
brownamber
with
an
offwhite
head
that
has
hardly
any
powers
of
retension
little
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
very
malty
sweet
aroma
nearly
orangelike
with
licorice
notes
and
alcohol
taking
a
sip
it
has
a
big
alcohol
presence
in
the
front
malt
sweetness
cross
the
middle
and
finishes
quite
crisp
bitter
and
warming
lingering
taste
of
molasses
and
slight
bit
of
hops
the
hop
character
is
noticable
not
dominating
by
any
means
medium
mouthfeel
with
this
one
lightly
carbed
a
very
good
sipping
beer
almost
a
bit
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
nice
and
creamy
though
the
carbonation
hits
you
late
alcohol
is
warm
down
your
throat
but
not
overpowering
on
the
palate
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
some
licorice
but
no
chocolate
like
on
the
nose
the
is
a
nice
amount
of
hops
to
balance
this
out
but
its
still
very
malty
definitely
a
sipper
but
good
for
the
style
ive
had
this
in
the
cellar
for
about
a
month
and
another
few
years
wouldnt
hurt
this
big
brew
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
the
canis
major
lineup
the
second
barley
wine
i
have
ever
had
as
the
first
it
was
interesting
to
try
but
definitely
not
something
i
would
want
on
a
regular
basis
dont
expect
a
hugely
hopped
beer
this
is
an
english
not
an
american
barley
wine
the
only
other
english
i
have
had
was
a
j
w
lees
offering
which
i
found
to
be
tremendously
sweet
not
so
with
horn
dog
yes
it
was
sweet
but
not
unbearably
so
no
it
wasnt
heavily
hopped
not
at
all
but
it
tasted
pretty
good
with
molasses
dominating
poured
medium
brown
with
red
tints
one
finger
head
and
minimal
retention
the
aroma
was
sweetish
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
just
almost
zero
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
really
didnt
notice
the
10
and
a
half
abv
this
bottle
came
in
a
four
pack
along
with
the
gonzo
imperial
porter
double
dog
and
tripel
all
for
a
ten
dollar
price
tag
one
of
the
best
craft
beer
deals
out
there
right
now
imo
color
is
dark
and
rosy
with
just
a
small
amount
of
white
laced
heading
some
brandy
whiffs
come
up
first
along
with
some
chocolate
and
stone
fruit
none
of
which
are
very
pronounced
plum
molasses
bitter
hops
and
alcohol
come
through
in
the
taste
this
beer
does
not
seem
to
be
trying
to
hide
the
fact
that
it
is
a
bit
hot
and
heavy
this
beer
took
me
the
better
part
of
an
hour
to
finish
which
is
the
way
it
should
be
with
a
beer
this
size
put
this
one
with
some
heavy
blue
cheese
or
simply
have
it
as
an
after
dinner
treat
again
definitely
grab
the
four
pack
this
beer
comes
in
cheers
overall
out
of
all
the
beers
i
had
to
date
this
is
the
epitome
of
a
sipper
beer
very
tasty
but
very
intense
i
dont
think
i
vcould
ever
picture
myself
drinking
more
of
one
of
these
in
a
night
maybe
i
just
have
to
work
my
way
up
to
it
pours
a
clear
reddishbrown
with
an
almost
invisible
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
alcohol
and
toasted
malt
taste
is
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
up
front
an
earthy
oaky
middle
and
a
dry
finish
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
burn
mouthfeel
is
rich
low
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
english
barleywine
it
isnt
a
hop
bomb
assault
like
some
american
styles
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
either
style
the
drinkability
is
good
though
with
such
high
alcohol
it
does
come
through
in
the
taste
a
bit
and
makes
this
a
slow
sipper
definitely
worth
trying
for
fans
of
malty
beers
d
definitely
a
sipper
it
goes
down
very
easily
considering
the
alcohol
content
this
is
something
ill
get
again
i
may
even
put
a
couple
back
to
try
with
some
aging
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
flying
dog
i
hope
its
available
in
the
winter
this
would
be
good
to
warm
up
with
on
a
cold
night
not
a
huge
fan
of
barleywines
but
this
one
pleasantly
surprised
me
the
dark
brown
pour
into
a
tulip
glass
kept
its
head
and
laced
well
throughout
the
session
the
aroma
called
to
mind
the
smell
of
sweet
wort
with
potent
dark
fruit
and
citrus
underscored
by
a
hint
of
alcohol
potency
however
the
taste
didnt
underscore
the
alcoholic
potency
at
all
the
flavor
was
syrupy
sweet
but
not
with
an
annoyingly
potent
finish
like
in
most
barleywines
the
texture
was
certainly
thick
but
normal
for
this
style
this
is
maybe
one
of
the
only
barleywines
i
have
come
across
that
i
was
able
to
finish
easily
seems
like
it
would
age
well
would
love
to
try
the
barrelaged
version
of
this
brew
d
this
is
a
sipper
and
if
one
does
more
than
that
watch
out
will
be
able
to
finish
this
pretty
easy
but
do
not
know
if
i
would
want
another
one
after
that
d
for
a
barley
wine
which
is
normally
hard
to
take
in
larger
quantities
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
or
at
least
slowly
sippable
which
is
okay
by
me
final
thoughts
this
is
much
different
than
i
remember
much
more
like
a
nice
barleywine
and
less
like
an
experiment
thick
and
rich
pretty
sweet
but
not
overly
which
masks
the
booze
well
some
roast
and
red
malts
toasty
and
tasty
solid
atmosphere
pretty
good
appearance
but
really
pleasing
and
full
complex
nose
flavor
not
as
complex
but
a
really
nice
balance
nothing
overpowering
just
a
solid
combination
of
effects
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
d
a
solid
barley
wine
straightforward
and
basic
but
has
it
where
it
counts
enjoyable
for
sure
d
this
beer
was
good
but
was
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
another
one
the
abv
was
pretty
well
hidden
by
the
sweetness
which
could
be
a
good
thing
d
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
i
have
ever
had
one
of
these
is
enough
almost
too
sweet
for
me
decent
sipper
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thin
tan
colored
head
the
aromas
are
alcohol
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
raisin
and
hop
a
nice
caramel
malt
flavor
hits
you
up
front
with
a
fruity
raisin
flavor
in
the
background
then
the
alcohol
flavors
and
warmth
kicks
in
and
it
finishes
somewhat
bitter
while
still
maintaining
the
sweetness
from
the
caramel
malts
and
some
of
the
fig
raisin
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
and
sticky
sweet
but
the
carbonation
in
the
beer
makes
in
creamy
and
smooth
pretty
good
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
tasty
but
it
may
be
hard
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
as
they
are
on
the
heavy
and
strong
side
definitely
a
fall
sipper
not
so
refreshing
in
the
summer
not
bad
but
there
are
better
choices
d
well
in
all
it
s
ok
i
would
put
a
minimum
of
a
year
rule
on
this
and
all
the
way
through
it
might
always
be
too
sweet
because
of
the
huge
variation
among
barley
wine
style
ales
and
between
such
ales
and
american
barley
wines
im
still
struggling
to
figure
out
how
well
this
fits
into
the
category
this
beer
has
almost
zero
hops
and
a
ton
of
dark
fruity
malt
market
this
as
a
wee
heavy
and
watch
the
ratings
go
sky
high
this
is
really
good
stuff
delicious
malt
and
deserves
a
high
rating
but
no
way
does
this
pass
for
an
english
barleywine
and
yet
their
double
dog
pale
ale
does
taste
just
like
a
barleywine
go
figure
md
overall
the
taste
of
this
barley
wine
style
ale
is
like
neither
a
traditional
english
barley
wine
nor
an
american
heavilyhopped
take
on
the
style
but
in
itself
a
superstrong
120
fullbodied
ale
with
intriguing
ingredients
of
the
brewerys
choosing
the
result
is
not
bad
at
all
slick
and
enticingly
fruitiness
balanced
by
a
thick
and
rich
dark
malty
base
but
for
a
strong
ale
at
this
calibre
with
this
level
of
density
and
a
semifull
sweetness
itd
better
be
sipped
in
small
quantity
like
a
dessert
barley
wine
otherwise
the
alcoholic
effect
can
easily
and
quickly
makes
its
presence
felt
d
a
bit
heavy
on
the
alcohol
flavor
the
10
is
appearant
for
sure
but
even
though
i
had
other
beers
lined
up
to
try
after
this
one
sample
i
had
to
reach
for
another
hopefully
i
can
manage
to
hold
on
to
a
few
of
these
to
check
back
on
in
a
year
or
two
and
while
this
is
not
a
session
by
any
means
for
a
beer
boasting
10
percent
it
is
highly
drinkable
it
just
goes
down
so
damn
smooth
drinkability
well
i
like
the
serving
size
and
i
like
the
flavor
i
just
wish
the
flavor
were
turned
up
a
little
i
like
to
age
barleywines
one
of
the
main
draws
for
me
and
i
couldnt
imagine
this
getting
more
complex
with
time
only
less
probably
wont
seek
this
out
again

the
alcohol
taste
comes
through
it
does
not
taste
as
strong
though
as
other
barely
wines
mouthfeel
offers
little
to
medium
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
a
solid
barely
wine
but
not
one
of
the
best
drinkability
you
have
to
watch
the
abv
here
but
all
things
considered
drinkability
is
pretty
good
12oz
served
at
55º
poured
a
murky
rusty
brown
color
with
a
beige
cascading
head
that
was
fairly
thin
but
had
decent
retention
and
left
some
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
were
chocolate
and
anise
with
some
hints
of
caramel
malts
somewhat
smells
like
a
faint
stout
or
porter
tastes
were
complex
toasted
grains
bready
caramel
chocolate
and
anise
with
notes
of
vanilla
some
faint
citrus
hoppiness
and
white
pepper
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
rather
thick
alcohol
was
present
and
left
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
as
it
warmed
the
throat
overall
somewhat
unique
for
a
barley
wine
with
the
chocolate
and
anise
flavors
but
not
a
bad
barley
wine
i
did
get
a
little
sick
of
it
towards
the
end
but
was
still
fairly
enjoyable
medium
carbonation
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
drinkability
suffers
quite
a
bit
from
the
overpowering
abv
but
to
me
this
is
a
lot
better
aged
i
tried
a
couple
of
these
fresh
about
a
year
ago
and
dont
remember
liking
them
too
much
this
still
isnt
anything
too
special
but
after
a
year
it
has
picked
up
quite
a
bit
i
doubt
ill
ever
look
for
these
again
but
it
was
nice
to
know
the
last
one
left
me
with
a
better
impression
than
the
fresh
bottles
did
originally
drinkability
as
most
barleyiwnes
it
is
a
bit
harsh
overall
a
good
drink
but
it
needs
to
be
mellowed
and
aged
first
also
its
going
to
be
boozy
and
will
basically
smack
you
in
the
face
d
i
wanted
this
be
better
than
it
was
kept
searching
for
some
redeeming
quality
but
there
was
nothing
that
stood
out
its
an
ok
beer
but
i
would
take
my
money
elsewhere
d
pretty
complex
and
enjoyable
good
stuff
here
although
not
like
most
barleywines
ive
had
alcohol
well
hidden
drinkability
for
most
this
would
be
a
hard
beer
to
drink
i
enjoy
barley
wine
however
but
what
disappointed
me
most
with
this
it
wasnt
as
an
intense
complex
and
mind
melting
as
most
barley
wines
are
in
taste
a
bit
subdued
for
my
taste
sweet
maltiness
is
the
first
thing
to
hit
the
tastebuds
but
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
toasty
and
hop
bitterness
there
to
dismiss
any
syrupy
lingering
effects
on
the
palate
alcohol
is
there
in
copious
amounts
as
well
has
a
oaky
almost
barrelaged
feel
to
it
you
can
tell
this
is
an
english
style
barleywine
as
it
lacks
resinous
citrusy
west
coast
hoppiness
and
has
a
sweeter
malt
base
some
acidic
fruit
goes
excellently
with
this
beer
in
fact
as
i
near
the
end
of
the
glass
i
think
this
is
a
damn
fine
barleywine
d
a
sipper
it
took
me
some
time
to
finish
drinkability
due
to
the
abv
this
is
a
sipper
a
decent
barleywine
i
recommend
as
a
gateway
barleywine
another
great
beer
to
ad
to
the
solid
lineup
from
flying
dog
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
very
faint
tancolored
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
a
fine
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
is
dominated
with
dried
fruits
and
accompanied
with
some
toasty
malts
and
a
little
booze
flavors
has
plenty
of
sticky
malt
and
dried
raisins
not
much
alcohol
is
detected
in
the
flavor
but
the
flavors
do
stop
short
its
a
full
to
medium
bodied
beer
and
has
a
light
carbonation
decent
barleywine
md
mouthfeel
is
of
red
wine
smooth
and
dry
on
the
tongue
almost
to
dry
finish
with
the
alcohol
feel
drinkable
in
moderation
im
a
barley
wine
fan
but
this
one
just
doesnt
impress
me
much
notes
a
good
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
i
pick
it
up
whenever
i
see
it
i
liked
the
beer
and
the
masking
of
the
alcohol
along
with
the
balance
is
what
i
liked
most
a
delicious
beer
dont
miss
this
one
if
you
have
the
chance
but
watch
out
for
the
punch
it
packs
drinkability
i
like
this
but
dont
love
it
its
a
sipper
and
probably
no
more
than
one
to
a
session
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
very
fruity
sweet
without
being
cloying
nice
thick
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
where
is
the
alcohol
it
is
hidden
in
the
taste
and
the
mouth
i
could
drink
this
all
night
well
for
a
little
while
anyway
overall
a
good
english
barleywine
but
its
so
strong
and
sweet
that
i
would
reserve
it
for
occasional
drinking
tm
this
is
not
your
grandpas
high
life
very
sweet
syrupy
beginning
that
last
through
most
of
experience
the
malts
move
in
after
the
sweet
beginning
there
is
almost
no
carbonation
and
no
hoppyness
that
i
can
detect
as
it
warms
it
almost
has
a
spiciness
to
it
the
warmer
it
is
the
more
mellow
it
gets
im
not
a
big
fan
of
barleywines
but
i
truly
enjoy
this
beer
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
with
some
flavors
that
stick
around
but
im
still
not
impressed
i
do
like
most
of
the
barley
wines
ive
had
but
this
doesnt
fall
into
that
category
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
and
ask
for
by
name
ill
probably
give
it
another
try
though
i
believe
everything
deserves
a
second
chance
to
some
extent
amber
with
a
creamy
sand
colored
head
that
leaves
sliding
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
vanilla
brown
sugar
dark
fruit
and
cocoa
definately
on
the
maltier
side
warm
alcohol
fudge
and
rum
soaked
fruit
are
finished
off
by
a
slightly
vinuous
charred
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
well
done
poured
a
copper
auburn
body
with
onefinger
tan
head
that
died
slowly
a
strong
roasted
and
caramel
malt
with
hints
of
yeast
bourbon
cask
oak
something
akin
to
wine
smooth
and
creamy
medium
body
with
hints
of
figs
dark
chocolate
toffee
coffee
butterscotch
bread
and
mostly
caramel
not
all
these
malts
may
be
noticeable
to
others
but
i
swear
i
picked
them
up
this
beer
was
just
all
over
the
place
on
my
tongue
in
terms
of
taste
finishes
slightly
dry
with
mild
hop
bitterness
and
a
very
minor
alcohol
burn
but
for
the
most
part
these
two
facets
of
the
beer
serve
to
only
balance
the
overall
sweet
malt
sensations
a
great
sipper
that
i
enjoyed
syrup
hides
the
alcohol
but
the
sweetness
takes
its
drinkability
down
a
bit
d
the
tastes
fluctuate
on
the
palate
making
it
hard
to
get
a
good
vibe
from
this
brew
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
drinkable
barleywine
d
a
decent
beer
with
lots
of
complex
flavour
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
it
all
that
often
was
hoping
for
some
more
hops
and
a
bit
more
bitterness
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
golden
dark
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
aroma
was
sweet
like
banana
bread
with
nutmeg
very
small
hint
of
vanilla
and
hops
also
taste
was
sweet
a
little
bit
of
syrup
in
the
back
a
touch
of
bitterness
with
some
milk
chocolate
and
vanilla
milk
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
very
well
a
touch
to
much
carbonation
was
the
only
detractor
didnt
hide
the
abv
very
well
hit
very
fast
so
needed
to
sip
flying
dog
not
my
fave
brewery
this
is
a
big
beer
but
not
really
big
pours
a
rich
dark
caramel
with
a
great
creamy
halfinch
head
exceptional
for
high
abv
smell
is
rich
mainly
malty
almost
molasseslike
hmm
mainly
sweet
no
overwhelming
alcohol
or
hopd
presence
unusual
for
a
barleywine
but
not
bad
wait
the
alcohol
does
kick
in
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
mainly
smooth
almost
cloying
good
dry
finish
not
bad
on
the
drinkability
scale
for
the
high
abv
pours
rich
and
purply
black
with
a
big
luxurious
head
that
falls
to
thick
bubbles
and
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
plummy
and
raisny
rich
and
malty
the
flavor
is
carmelly
and
plummy
like
a
delicious
plum
sauce
it
has
a
little
peppery
character
on
the
finish
and
a
little
brandylike
slap
of
alcohol
the
effect
is
like
a
rich
blackberry
brandy
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
clingy
leaving
a
pleasant
sweetandbitter
residue
on
the
tongue
d
i
dont
know
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
of
a
bummer
for
me
but
a
deviation
from
my
norm
and
interesting
to
say
the
least
d
nothing
spectacular
yet
still
tasty
worth
drinking
again
im
a
bit
confused
as
to
origin
all
the
flying
dogs
listed
on
ba
are
from
maryland
my
bottles
say
denver
now
im
a
big
fan
of
the
flying
dog
ales
and
artwork
but
never
had
this
one
the
first
thig
i
notices
was
the
potent
overpowering
smell
of
nutty
barley
wine
that
had
the
feel
of
high
alchohol
content
witha
fruity
overtone
the
foam
was
a
average
wheat
color
that
dissapated
quickly
t
extremely
robust
and
potent
rich
nutty
and
a
bit
fruity
and
deep
the
color
of
very
dark
redbrown
that
told
me
this
was
going
to
be
a
potent
tasting
ale
as
in
drinkability
i
couldnt
really
drink
this
heavy
ale
with
ease
it
had
to
be
sipped
like
a
fine
brandy
to
appreciate
the
complex
notes
in
the
taste
future
outlook
barlywines
dont
seem
to
be
my
favorite
style
though
offerings
like
this
are
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
wish
these
were
sold
regularly
in
the
7
oz
bottles
seems
to
be
the
perfect
size
for
a
beer
like
this
a
good
offering
and
im
sure
ill
have
it
again
d
not
very
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
drink
a
sip
and
feel
like
youre
drinking
a
gallon
part
of
the
canis
major
mixed
eight
pack
purchased
at
abes
in
bethlehem
poured
from
a
7
ounce
bottle
into
my
shaker
glass
appears
a
hazed
brownish
amber
with
barely
half
an
inch
of
rapidly
fading
foam
minimal
lacing
sticks
to
the
inside
of
my
glass
with
each
passing
sip
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
lightly
caramelized
malts
brown
sugar
figs
maybe
some
prunes
and
dried
apples
no
real
hop
presence
to
speak
of
almost
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
very
little
alcohol
presence
a
tasty
sipping
bw
d
the
most
drinkable
barley
wine
ive
ever
had
but
12
oz
would
be
plenty
this
is
damn
tasty
and
quite
possibly
the
best
of
the
canis
major
mix
pack
i
picked
up
very
good
barleywine
i
love
it
the
alcohol
is
real
prominent
so
watch
out
well
recommended
this
beer
was
good
and
much
more
of
a
well
balanced
brew
after
about
15
min
hope
you
dont
have
anything
to
do
after
drinking
this
one
or
two
overall
a
big
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
more
than
once
drinkability
decent
barleywine
but
too
boozy
to
be
a
regular
drinker
the
taste
is
kind
simple
lacking
complexity
one
to
try
but
that
might
be
it
d
definitely
a
beer
i
will
be
cellaring
a
malt
heavy
offering
that
contrasts
nicely
with
the
hoppier
members
of
my
collection
for
what
it
is
it
is
incredibly
good
to
drink
slowly
it
is
not
too
much
in
any
essence
except
possibly
the
alcohol
kick
to
the
brain
once
you
have
finished
it
all
very
well
balanced
i
find
compared
to
some
american
ales
with
a
nice
smooth
buttery
like
mouthfeel
and
a
heavy
body
very
well
done
not
the
best
but
still
good
if
you
are
being
responsible
however
then
by
all
means
this
is
one
to
indulge
with
overall
pretty
decent
d
bleh
this
is
not
an
easy
drinker
due
to
the
abv
presense
and
lack
of
taste
d
good
flavor
and
not
too
noticeable
alcohol
taste
definitely
a
sipping
beer
no
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
very
enjoyable
md
a
little
syrupysugary
but
otherwise
fine
flavor
lasts
a
while
very
drinkable
i
had
to
slow
myself
down
so
i
could
enjoy
the
flavor
serving
type
bottle
d
extreamly
good
drinkablity
notes
not
my
favorite
barley
wine
great
lakes
was
my
favorite
but
a
very
solid
option
recommended
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
amber
tint
when
held
to
the
light
the
brew
has
a
slight
off
white
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
from
the
higher
alcohol
content
the
aroma
is
tart
and
has
clove
and
malt
in
the
backbone
the
flavor
of
this
brew
is
a
little
off
from
the
bottles
chocolate
and
licorice
description
there
is
a
definite
barley
wine
flavor
with
strong
clove
fig
followed
with
an
aged
bourbon
after
taste
this
is
a
heavier
bodied
brew
with
medium
carbonation
good
beer
but
hard
to
drink
to
many
of
the
barley
wine
group
d
low
drinkability
first
barley
wine
i
had
and
not
sure
if
i
would
have
another
dbecause
of
the
booziness
of
this
one
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
anymore
of
this
kind
of
dissapointed
decent
beer
not
disappointed
but
i
wouldnt
search
high
and
low
for
it
first
thought
a
very
busy
boozey
mouthful
a
butterscotchy
taste
accompanies
the
alcohol
not
really
sweet
it
takes
the
hops
at
the
end
to
get
rid
of
the
sharp
alcohol
flavor
kind
of
smokey
also
almost
like
a
scotch
except
there
really
isnt
that
smoothness
to
it
it
just
sticks
in
my
throat
mouthfeel
is
just
ok
although
im
probably
preoccupied
on
the
other
aspects
right
now
the
smell
is
the
only
thing
going
for
it
there
are
sweeter
maltier
hoppier
and
smoother
barleywines
out
there
and
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
this
out
again
pours
very
dark
brown
mahogany
color
i
got
no
head
outta
this
one
so
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
either
big
malty
taste
with
this
one
a
little
bit
sweet
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
2
or
3
for
that
reason
has
just
enough
hops
to
balance
out
the
malt
just
a
bit
but
is
not
bitter
whatsoever
more
i
drink
it
the
sweeter
it
seems
to
get
not
sickening
sweet
just
yet
but
im
thinkin
maybe
i
could
now
only
drink
one
of
these
bad
boys
at
a
time
alcohol
is
also
hidden
very
well
in
this
one
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
slick
foamy
mouthfeel
eases
the
drinking
experience
and
makes
it
even
more
positive
this
was
a
very
nice
surprise
and
is
an
example
of
how
a
beers
label
can
be
deceiving
its
not
all
crazy
and
violent
as
the
design
suggests
recommended
for
its
uniqueness
alone
d
although
i
am
not
a
bwine
afficianado
i
have
been
drinking
more
lately
this
is
low
on
my
list
so
far
flavor
not
up
there
like
the
etoh
heat
is
d
this
is
a
very
aggresive
bw
perhaps
with
some
aging
and
some
mellowing
this
would
be
a
bit
tastier
but
still
a
solid
beer

d
i
never
thought
i
was
too
fond
of
english
barleywine
this
went
quite
nicely
with
some
chocolate
as
it
warmed
it
was
a
bit
spicy
alcohol
wise
for
me
i
would
try
this
beer
again
mouthfeel
is
very
viscous
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
that
fits
well
i
had
this
from
the
7
oz
taster
pack
and
i
could
have
definitely
gone
for
12
oz
of
this
brew
strong
the
alcohol
creeps
up
on
you
and
it
may
be
too
sweet
for
multiple
pours
but
its
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
a
good
barleywine
not
flying
dogs
best
effort
d
this
beer
is
way
too
easy
drinking
considering
its
high
abv
this
is
one
thick
beer
epitomizes
the
beer
is
food
idea
drinking
this
one
in
the
morning
is
defiantly
filling
me
up
almost
syrupy
in
its
texture
but
not
in
a
bad
way
this
is
one
hell
of
a
sipper
you
wouldnt
want
to
chug
it
even
if
you
could
it
tastes
like
a
smorgasbord
of
meets
and
cranberry
cordial
at
a
renaissance
fair
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
tint
good
carbonation
left
a
very
good
dirty
white
tan
head
smelled
of
toffee
sugar
and
lots
of
malt
the
abv
is
disguised
very
well
taste
is
thick
syrupy
and
malty
just
the
way
i
like
it
mouthfeel
is
thick
malty
but
not
to
complex
at
room
temperature
this
one
gets
thick
a
good
barleywine
but
not
of
the
best
drinkability
was
medium
sweet
flavors
dominate
w
a
mild
alcohol
heat
good
but
not
great
barleywine
there
isnt
enough
rich
buttery
caramel
malt
for
all
of
the
hops
and
alcohol
its
fairly
affordable
for
a
barleywine
which
is
nice
im
not
sure
how
well
it
conforms
as
an
english
barleywine
its
fairly
hoppy
at
this
point
the
beer
could
probably
use
some
age
on
it
theres
some
good
caramel
malt
in
there
and
syrupy
barley
nice
though
the
alcohol
drowns
things
out
a
bit
vodka
notes
even
come
up
a
bit
the
feel
is
warm
and
a
bit
sticky
it
drinks
fairly
well
but
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
complexity
and
smoothness
of
some
barleywines

i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
flying
dog
offering
from
the
first
pour
i
knew
i
would
love
it
the
color
was
almost
caramel
and
the
head
sat
perfectly
atop
the
beer
until
the
first
sip
i
first
tried
this
from
just
a
sevenounce
bottle
and
when
it
was
over
i
wish
i
had
a
22ouncer
typically
im
a
big
hophead
and
love
ipas
and
dipas
but
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
to
anyone
d
a
challenging
drop
i
think
there
are
elements
of
interest
but
a
certain
angularity
that
makes
it
a
bit
obnoxious
d
definitely
not
for
sessioning
awesome
for
cold
weather
and
pretty
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
heavilybodied
and
syrupy
drinkability
is
about
average
for
a
barleywine
the
alcohol
stops
me
after
i
finish
the
first
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
bite
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
hint
of
red
has
a
one
finger
head
that
is
off
white
and
leave
a
little
lacing
has
a
nice
fruity
aroma
that
is
light
as
for
the
taste
there
is
a
little
bit
of
fruit
very
malty
and
sugary
decent
beer
but
nothing
great
definitley
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
pours
a
beautiful
deep
red
with
a
decent
brown
head
powerful
smells
of
brown
sugar
maraschino
cherries
sweet
malts
and
tons
of
alcohol
this
is
a
big
beer
though
not
as
big
as
some
barely
wines
out
there
i
love
it
i
barely
took
a
sip
and
it
exploded
with
burnt
malts
and
molasses
galore
all
balanced
by
generous
amounts
of
piney
and
resinous
hops
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
barley
wines
that
ive
had
at
least
in
the
sense
that
its
pleasant
to
sip
on
its
own
without
food
and
doesnt
leave
my
palate
feeling
beat
down
finish
is
long
and
sweet
an
excellent
beer
da
nice
winter
brew
taste
is
big
malty
with
a
good
kiss
of
hops
striking
bitterness
and
a
big
hoppy
alchohol
burn
that
makes
this
a
good
cold
evening
beer
d
this
is
the
fat
boy
or
little
man
of
malt
bombs
sugary
sweet
flabby
obese
overly
malty
and
lacking
in
the
hop
department
this
is
not
terrible
but
it
could
go
on
a
diet
and
it
could
definitely
use
some
more
hops
note
mine
is
a
2007
vintage
bottle
and
this
being
the
first
few
hours
of
2009
it
could
have
lost
some
of
its
hop
power
ill
have
to
pick
up
some
fresh
and
see
if
the
hops
come
out
in
fuller
force
good
beer
this
might
be
my
first
barleywine
its
pretty
interesting
d
this
is
a
pretty
good

i
dont
think
i
could
have
more

an

the

was
not

too
much
and
the
taste
of
the
burn
of
it
got
to
me
later
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
fairly
strong
alcohol
presence
winds
up
hurting
its
drinkability
this
is
a
one
and
done
the
head
is
strong
and
doesnt
waste
any
time
id
suggest
starting
out
with
this
brew
and
then
move
on
to
something
a
bit
lighter
maybe
a
new
glarus
totally
naked
or
something
along
that
line
regardless
this
is
certainly
a
brew
you
should
try
big
body
low
carbonation
a
real
nice
sipper
my
preferred
style
of
barleywine
compared
to
the
american
hop
bomb
type
this
is
a
great
example
mouth
feel
smooth
and
slightly
carbonated
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
chesnut
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
of
a
medicianal
booze
very
heavy
on
the
alcohol
with
a
hint
of
a
sweetener
added
the
beer
is
full
bodied
and
complex
dried
fruit
notes
are
followed
by
a
potent
alcoholic
punch
the
finish
is
clean
this
beer
will
really
sock
it
to
you
at
11
abv
but
it
still
is
quite
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
copper
color
with
a
off
white
hide
good
amount
of
lacing
as
i
drank
the
beer
slightly
fruit
smell
but
not
strong
strong
hit
of
hops
in
the
beginning
then
the
sweet
malts
hit
i
nice
full
mouth
feel
too
this
barely
wine
acouple
of
these
in
one
sitting
would
easily
catch
up
with
you
i
love
this
beer
i
love
flying
dog
its
a
win
win
really
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
almost
mucky
brown
if
you
didnt
know
it
was
gonna
be
great
you
would
probably
think
it
looks
nasty
the
smell
is
super
sweet
and
amazingly
malty
the
malts
are
really
complex
too
the
taste
is
filled
with
various
malts
very
little
hoppy
notes
but
very
sweet
with
caramel
dark
malt
and
some
fruit
notes
too
there
are
many
after
hits
of
the
malt
notes
after
you
swallow
which
is
actually
the
best
flavor
this
is
a
nice
factor
because
you
feel
and
taste
the
malt
notes
instead
of
hop
based
bitterness
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
barleywines
you
can
find
commonly
thanks
again
flying
dog
for
another
great
beer
good
stuff
very
wine
like

dark

nice
looking
reddish

with
a
nice

flavor
like
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
background
nice
and
smooth
with
an
alcohol
warming
at
the
end
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
barleywines
can
be
so
much
more
interesting
it
doesnt
really
have
any
negatives
but
it
only
has
weak
positives
except
for
the
smell
ill
throw
a
few
in
the
cellar
and
try
in
a
year
or
two
d
this
is
one
of
my
favs
from
year
to
year
and
the
2008
is
as
good
as
any
of
the
past
ones
i
like
these
alot
but
i
have
to
remember
to
watch
out
for
that
10
5
abv
done
bottle
is
good
for
a
sitting
however
its
an
enjoyable
barleywine
that
would
be
enjoyable
again
in
the
future
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
alcoholic
harshness
but
that
trait
could
possibly
be
subdued
with
aging
what
a
great
beer
overall
great
to
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
after
being
outside
all
day
stacking
firewood
low
hopped
highly
malty
high
abv
i
think
ill
have
another
bottle
from
ty
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
a
small
thin
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
light
the
taste
is
great
grapes
raisin
some
chocolate
and
assorted
sweets
and
some
small
hops
and
malt
flavors
really
nice
like
a
wine
but
with
beer
greatness
the
alcohol
is
really
subdued
overall
a
great
beer
fizzy
and
creamy
thick
and
chewy
wellbalanced
thick
dark
fruits
lots
of
alcohol
d
a
little
potent
and
warming
to
be
anything
more
than
a
sipper
one
or
two
bottles
in
a
night
would
be
perfect
this
one
is
definitely
a
sipper
a
big
gulp
can
bring
out
the
burn
in
the
alcohol
keeps
the
cold
fallwinter
nights
at
bay
this
is
a
nice
winter
beer
very
tasty
overall
for
a
beer
that
looks
like
aunt
jemima
this
is
not
too
bad
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
i
can
manage
interesting

this
can
only
improve
with

concord
nh
a
very
good
english
bwine
though
my
american
read
hop
head
sensibility
is
looking
for
more
hops
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
definetly
something
to
drink
again
if
im
in
need
of
an
english
bwine
i
was
a
disapointed
by
this
beer
id
much
rather
have
a
bigfoot
i
bought
two
so
ill
let
one
age
for
a
while
until
then
ill
stick
with
double
dog
mouthfeelmedium
carbonation
delivers
a
light
bitterness
that
fades
quickly
the
malt
body
is
there
but
the
dried
fruit
flavors
are
really
dominant
this
one
is
least
a
2007
maybe
a
2006
the
alcohol
warmth
comes
in
at
the
finish
a
froth
on
the
palate
heightens
the
fruit
flavors
with
some
caramel
and
estery
flavors
coming
through
very
much
towards
the
english
style
barleywine
and
this
tasted
great
not
too
hot
and
as
stated
above
this
one
has
obviously
aged
somewhat
even
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
remained
consistant
pours
dark
cherrybrown
with
no
head
not
very
carbonated
no
lacing
nose
is
very
strong
lots
of
alcohols
and
heavy
malts
taste
is
also
very
strong
a
bit
heavy
and
syrupy
with
the
abv
coming
through
the
balance
is
pretty
good
overall
though
considering
the
strength
of
its
elements
once
sitting
it
goes
down
a
lot
more
easily
a
respectively
good
but
not
great
barleywine
drinkability
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
perhaps
too
malty
for
me
and
i
did
find
it
a
bit
cloying
at
times
the
taste
is
strong
winey
fruit
plums
raisins
with
a
strong
toasted
bread
quality
a
little
dry
chocolate
mostly
plain
cocoa
without
the
bitterness
a
woodyearthy
quality
hint
of
gingerbread
it
morphs
from
a
richyl
fruity
sweet
alcoholic
quality
up
front
to
a
drier
more
toastycocoa
quality
in
the
finish
along
with
hint
of
burnt
fruit
the
alcohol
is
quite
evident
and
adds
warm
pungency
but
its
mostly
smooth
and
tasty
the
stength
brings
down
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
not
much
it
is
zesty
and
lively
always
engaging
and
the
flavours
get
even
beter
yet
smoother
as
it
warms
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
esp
as
it
warms
and
at
first
sip
i
didnt
hink
it
was
going
to
be
as
easy
to
drink
as
it
ended
up
being
pours
a
very
nice
dark
copper
color
with
some
good
if
thininitial
head
and
some
very
nice
lacing
it
has
a
nice
deep
malty
scent
very
sweet
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
same
for
the
taste
very
deep
and
thick
an
almost
doublebock
caramel
flavor
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
for
such
a
high
abv
brew
the
horns
on
this
dog
are
still
a
little
too
sharp
i
would
suspect
some
time
would
help
tame
this
dog
its
a
nice
cloudy
amber
color
good
looking
barleywine
hardly
any
carbonation
alcohol
flavor
comes
through
pretty
strongly
but
it
has
a
surprisingly
light
and
clean
mouthfeel
i
like
the
sweet
malt
flavor
accented
by
noticeable
hoppyness
i
need
to
try
more
flying
dog
brews
overall
this
one
was
very
nice
it
is
somewhat
of
a
malt
bomb
though
in
my
opinion
but
still
very
good
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
alright
i
have
a
feeling
i
couldnt
handle
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
session
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
as
for
it
being
my
first
barlywine
it
was
a
fun
beer
to
experience
reminded
me
slightly
of
a
porter
but
i
will
be
only
drinking
these
on
occasion
taste
see
smell
perhaps
im
finally
getting
a
taste
for
the
style
but
i
really
enjoy
this
barley
wine
drinkability
i
thought
this
one
was
pretty
good
actually
a
nice
complex
malt
profile
a
decent
amount
of
hop
balance
some
pleasant
fruity
notes
sure
the
alcohols
up
there
but
of
course
its
gonna
be
showin
at
10
5
give
this
one
a
shot
one
of
the
better
big
dogs
in
the
flying
dog
arsenal
this
beer
surprised
me
a
very
nice
barleywine
d
very
different
beer
when
enjoyed
at
warmer
temperatures
however
i
am
inpatient
and
would
rather
grab
something
else
got
this
in
the
flying
dog
mixpack
and
glad
i
did
because
i
dont
think
i
would
be
able
to
handle
a
six
pack
of
this
it
would
take
me
awhile
to
get
through
this
was
actually
one
of
my
first
barley
wines
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
style
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
one
as
my
tastes
get
more
refined
for
2
49bottle
a
great
value
for
a
barleywine
beer
their
imp
porter
and
this
are
so
both
very
high
quality
beers
the
beer
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
brownishred
with
very
little
head
into
a
chalice
there
was
very
little
aroma
to
speak
of
just
a
whiff
of
alcoholic
esters
however
alcholic
esters
dominated
the
flavor
and
were
mixed
with
ample
hop
bitterness
and
molassestoffee
undertones
a
little
raw
but
would
age
nicely
imho
second
of
a
four
bottle
pack
i
purchased
as
city
beer
this
beer
pours
an
extremely
dark
amber
almost
too
dark
to
tell
but
the
light
reflection
allows
you
to
see
whats
hiding
in
the
murk
there
is
subtle
alcohol
smell
but
you
can
hardly
notice
it
until
it
goes
down
the
hatch
theres
a
minimal
alcohol
burn
im
guessing
a
mild
bourbon
for
a
second
i
thought
i
was
drinking
a
super
mild
angels
share
the
first
one
i
had
of
this
batch
seemed
to
have
a
higher
sugar
content
this
bottle
is
really
mellow
and
mildly
carbonated
this
is
for
sure
an
english
style
bw
because
its
super
mellow
compared
to
its
american
mostly
west
coast
counterparts
very
little
if
not
any
hops
i
am
really
pleased
with
this
beer
although
its
american
brewed
it
has
made
me
want
to
search
for
authentic
english
bws
aging
these
12oz
bottles
could
do
wonders
and
i
recommend
doing
so
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
sit
and
drink
a
case
of
it
an
above
average
barleywine
for
sure
has
some
decent
carbonation
and
a
nice
sweet
taste
the
high
abv
is
hidden
well
for
the
most
part
but
does
kinda
sneak
in
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
with
a
nice
smooth
aftertaste
and
full
body
drinkability
is
good
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
had
but
a
bit
overdone
on
the
sweetness
in
the
malt
d
like
this
one
but
not
all
night
d
this
could
be
better
but
it
is
better
than
all
of
the
flying
dog
brews
i
have
tried
not
saying
much
though
doesnt
have
to
overwhelming
metallic
ass
taste
flying
dog
brews
usually
have
and
kill
any
chance
of
liking
the
brew
metallic
taste
is
there
but
extremely
subdued
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
another
there
are
better
barleywines
out
there
this
is
a
good
beer
appearance
is
ok
with
no
real
head
and
a
little
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
both
very
good
and
similar
honestly
tastes
like
a
wine
with
a
bit
more
alcohol
a
nice
malt
back
bone
that
is
a
bit
dry
hops
that
are
a
bit
sweet
and
some
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
decent
a
lot
again
like
wine
i
would
say
a
merlot
with
some
weight
to
it
but
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
its
a
sipper
no
doubt
but
its
a
pleasure
d
drinks
great
for
such
a
high
abv
really
surprising
this
is
a
big
but
balanced
brew
malt
is
rich
and
complex
earthy
hops
bring
balance
and
counterpoint
to
the
sweetness
unfortunately
the
alcohol
comes
off
a
little
too
harsh
and
dissonant
i
like
big
boozy
brews
but
this
one
needs
to
cellar
for
awhile
d
a
really
good
review
overall
its
drinkability
for
me
stems
from
the
depth
of
aroma
and
complexity
of
flavor
which
constantly
keep
me
searching
for
more
intricacies
a
world
of
taste
yet
to
be
discovered
although
i
wouldnt
quite
write
my
mama
and
tell
her
about
this
one
i
assume
cellaring
for
a
few
years
would
totally
reform
and
mellow
this
monster
caterpillar
into
one
bad
ass
butterfly
but
sadly
this
is
my
only
bottle
powerful
and
sedative
one
is
enufff
aroma
is
rich
and
has
hints
of
licorice
orange
and
chocolate
it
lacks
the
alcohol
nip
that
i
have
gotten
from
most
barley
wines
color
is
a
clear
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
and
persistent
yellowishbeige
head
flavor
is
mainly
malty
and
has
ribbons
of
burnt
caramel
unsweetened
chocolate
and
hops
alcohol
bite
is
not
very
noticeable
which
is
a
plus
texture
is
very
smooth
and
aftertaste
has
equal
amounts
of
sweetness
and
hoppy
bitterness
consensus
here
amongst
buds
is
a
very
user
friendly
barley
wine
cant
think
of
a
more
balanced
barley
wine
than
this
poured
with
a
nice
head
an
plenty
a
lace
would
be
great
as
a
beforeafter
dinner
treat
pleasing
rich
dark
amber
color
fruity
bittersweet
balanced
a
tad
boozy
in
the
finish
n
ats
it
alcohol
hits
about
halfway
through
a
slow
drinker
kind
of
kicking
my
butt
right
now
maybe
im
on
an
empty
stomach
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
have
one
of
just
not
interesting
enough
to
demand
sip
after
sip
generally
id
prefer
a
nice
doppelbock
overall
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
and
a
pretty
good
deal
worth
a
shot
perhaps
not
really
the
right
beer
for
these
hot
georgia
summer
nights
but
im
of
the
opinion
that
theres
no
perfect
season
to
enjoy
a
beer
a
good
beer
is
a
good
beer
and
though
this
is
not
groundbreaking
as
far
as
the
style
goes
it
is
most
definitely
a
good
beer
this
full
bodied
beer
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
excellent
bite
balanced
carbonation
and
a
better
then
decent
nose
all
of
which
mask
the
over
10
abv
although
you
can
feel
the
warmth
in
your
throat
after
the
first
few
sips
a
fine
offering
from
flying
dog
two
years
mellowing
imparted
a
nice
character
to
this
already
fine
offering
from
flying
dog
deep
brownamber
color
some
haze
and
a
moderate
head
that
settles
to
a
pretty
nice
foamy
ring
on
top
aroma
is
sugary
with
alcohol
sweet
malts
and
some
oak
the
flavor
is
sweet
raisins
and
plums
with
maple
sugar
and
honey
with
some
alcohol
noticeable
finishes
with
some
spice
and
hops
not
complex
but
good
for
whatever
reason
while
not
as
complex
this
reminds
me
a
little
of
dogfish
immort
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
barleywine
even
as
it
warms
not
spectacular
but
i
liked
it
i
poured
this
offering
into
a
wine
goblet
this
amber
brown
opague
liquid
produced
a
very
slight
head
that
decided
not
to
hang
around
for
the
party
the
smell
was
quite
pleasant
with
the
raisin
and
cherry
dominating
the
nose
the
taste
was
very
much
like
the
smell
raisin
and
plum
like
characters
with
some
brown
sugar
and
caramel
to
go
along
with
the
malt
finishes
with
a
slight
bitter
twang
and
a
bit
of
carbonation
to
the
back
of
the
palate
flying
dog
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
this
example
of
there
fine
work
has
not
let
me
down
its
times
like
these
that
makes
me
glad
that
i
started
drinking
better
beer
this
beer
is
elegant
and
its
a
sipper
and
i
could
sip
it
all
day
and
be
happy
without
the
hoppiness
great
beer
from
flying
dog
finished
off
the
flying
dog
mixed
4
pack
horn
dog
is
definitely
an
english
barleywine
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
overthetop
a
nice
sipping
beer
this
was
my
first
barleywine
style
brew
and
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
at
first
but
now
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
44

i
am
not
ready
for
beer
this
strong
or
complex
as
a
beer
drinker
ill
stick
to
porters
and
ipas
and
leave
this
stuff
for
the
bros
overall
an
english
barleywine
without
the
annoying
english
flavors
very
good
and
satisfyingly
different
d
i
prefer
hopforward
american
barleywines
however
this
one
is
just
sweet
enough
that
i
will
sip
it
as
befits
such
a
large
beer
rather
than
rushing
through
it
all
and
all
this
is
a
very
sold
beer
well
worth
trying
but
not
something
that
ill
make
a
habit
of
drinking
often
d
im
no
flying
dog
fan
but
this
was
pretty
good
it
was
a
well
balanced
barely
wine
it
wasnt
overly
alcoholic
and
had
a
nice
hop
and
malt
balance
drinkability
definitely
one
of
the
sweeter
smoother
barleywines
ive
ever
had
way
more
depth
than
i
would
have
expected
out
of
a
flying
dog
brew
a
diamond
in
the
rough
and
a
total
surprise
for
a
barlywine
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
note
this
is
an
english
bw
i
tell
ya
show
me
the
guy
who
decides
which
style
a
bw
is
thats
the
guy
who
knows
his
stuff
such
subtle
differences
soft
and
silky
sticky
a
bit
but
not
obnoxiously
so
great
linger
upon
the
palate
superb
sipper
as
per
style
this
poured
a
hazy
muddy
brown
with
almost
no
head
it
smelled
like
molasses
and
caramel
with
barley
malt
it
tasted
very
complex
with
many
layers
of
citrus
hops
caramel
malt
barley
raisin
bread
bitter
chocolate
and
alcohol
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
brief
surprisingly
sweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
much
better
constructed
than
i
anticipated
with
intricate
and
delicate
flavor
that
was
still
fairly
easy
to
drink
well
done
last
but
not
least
this
is
one
of
the
good
ones
in
from
a
brewery
that
makes
a
lot
of
ordinary
beers
good
job
on
this
one
dogs
pours
a
crisp
dark
copper
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
burnt
caramel
dark
malts
and
brown
sugar
taste
has
lots
of
the
complexity
youd
expect
from
a
barleywine
burnt
caramel
molasses
hints
of
fruit
subtle
undertoned
hops
the
beer
is
certainly
heavy
with
present
alcohol
but
it
is
tolerable
just
a
sipper
this
one
is
worth
picking
up
every
now
and
then
and
would
likely
be
better
with
some
aging
but
there
are
certainly
better
barleywines
out
there
drinkability
well
i
will
say
its
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
flying
dog
lineup
the
drinkability
is
good
for
a
big
brew
prosit
mk
d
nice
sipper
for
those
cold
winter
nights
sitting
on
the
balcony
will
keep
you
warm
and
satisfied
drinks
fairly
easy
despite
its
high
abv
billing
d
normally
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
bite
but
this
malty
behemoth
is
a
wail
of
a
beer
pretty
darn
good
and
absurdly
drinkable
given
how
high
the
abv
is
flying
dogs
barleywiine
style
ale
is
certainly
a
small
dessert
in
a
glass
it
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
the
aroma
and
taste
are
full
of
malts
and
fruity
hints
while
maintining
a
bit
of
spice
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
like
many
barleywines
seem
pretty
subjective
if
you
like
thick
heavy
drinks
then
youll
enjoy
it
if
not
you
might
not
be
able
to
take
much
more
after
one
of
these
it
is
however
a
little
less
heavydense
than
say
weyerbachers
blithering
idiot
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
then
its
good
if
youre
not
familiar
with
the
style
this
may
be
an
ok
introduction
the
colors
in
ralph
steadmans

for
this
label
add
a
nice
aesthetic
touch
to
the
bottle
with
the
deep
blues

guess
it

it
would
be
my
guess
that
this
recipe
hasnt
changed
and
that
some
cellaring
would
be
advantageous
i
have
three
of
the
2001
and
and
now
three
of
the
2003
laid
down
a
little
goes
a
long
ways
let
it
warm
and
sip
accordingly
the
long
time
it
takes
to
savor
one
of
these
lets
you
taste
the
difference
as
it
warms
from
fridge
temperature
to
much
warmer
it
tastes
great
in
the
mid
50s
but
if
you
start
there
it
may
well
be
room
temperature
before
you
finish
start
cold
and
take
your
time
a
gnarly
and
complex
beer
with
some
aging
i
think
this
will
be
great
so
ive
put
two
in
the
cellar
oh
wait
never
mind
on
the
cellaring
drinkability
not
quite
and
americanstyle
barleywine
but
close
i
dont
think
this
one
will
stand
extended
aging
maybe
just
from
year
to
year
still
pretty
good
if
youre
willing
to
plunk
down
the
the
label
art
rocks
too
so
far
ive
not
found
a
barleywine
that
i
thoroughly
enjoy
but
horn
dog
surprised
me
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
but
thick
head
the
aroma
was
chocolatescoffee
with
alcohol
hints
and
some
malts
the
flavor
was
surprisingly
smooth
very
fruity
beginning
but
finished
off
with
a
grassypine
feel
very
cool
i
have
to
recommend
this
barleywine
one
of
the
best
ive
had
to
date
drinkability

way
to
easy
going
down
for
a
10
5
abv
bottle
be
careful
with
this
one
like
a
glass
of
maple
sap
it
eases
down
the
pipes
jittin
its
woody
orange
rind
action
all
over
your
buds
aromas
of
dark
berries
and
chocolate
cremes
and
twigs
delight
the
sniffer
quality
barleywine
drinks
as
easy
as
most
and
better
than
many
even
with
all
the
junk
suspended
in
the
glass
i
found
this
a
very
welldone
enjoyable
barleywine
the
head
was
thick
puffy
and
stable
for
the
style
aroma
is
dominantly
malty
gristlike
with
a
background
of
hops
alcohol
mingles
with
the
malt
smell
i
love
that
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
indicate
and
has
plenty
of
fruit
and
woody
qualities
blackberries
oak
plum
etc
finish
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hops
alcohol
is
present
through
the
entire
experience
but
isnt
dominant
and
adds
a
pleasing
roughness
to
the
finish
moderately
creamy
mouthfeel
but
it
falls
short
of
the
luxurious
meatiness
of
some
barleywines
again
very
welldone
and
extremely
drinkable
dark
reddish
color
with
no
head
only
a
thin
tan
color
aroma
of
malt
period
taste
is
an
old
grainy
taste
very
astringent
mild
sweetness
not
a
surprise
considering
my
recent
run
ins
with
the
rest
of
the
litter
alcohol
is
very
apparent
and
distracting
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
drinkability
is
poor
i
suffered
through
this
one
one
of
my
worst
barleywines
ack
i
believe
this
was
the
2002
bottling
as
always
the
ralph
steadman
artwork
is
cool
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
moderate
haziness
with
a
thick
khaki
colored
head
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
smooth
and
rich
with
an
odd
apple
pear
cherry
pineapple
mix
interesting
flavor
is
very
rich
a
touch
thinner
than
other
barleywines
ive
tried
ive
had
lighter
bodies
on
some
nice
fruity
flavors
big
malt
copious
hopping
and
a
great
smooth
carbonation
almost
silky
and
i
think
the
six
months
ive
held
on
to
this
beer
has
helped
i
wish
i
bought
a
whole
4
pack
so
i
could
try
one
every
six
months
or
so
way
better
than
i
expected
nicely
mellowed
after
2
years
flavors
married
outstandingly
well
hops
are
decidedly
subdued
compared
to
a
fresh
bottle
alcohol
less
apparent
and
more
meshed
into
the
beer
a
great
example
of
how
a
us
microbrewery
can
make
an
english
style
bw
wout
overdoing
the
hop
rate
a
solid
barleywine
fresh
or
aged
a
bit
very
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
big
malty
beer
upon
first
taste
and
being
a
barleywine
fan
i
thought
it
couldnt
be
that
strong
because
the
alcohol
was
masked
so
well
but
after
finishing
it
i
realized
this
is
one
brew
to
be
reckoned
with
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
with
a
robust
array
of
chocolate
malty
notes
as
well
as
raisins
or
dates
hops
are
there
as
well
but
not
in
hop
head
lovers
quantities
its
very
complex
and
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
hearty
but
not
cloying
i
loved
the
way
it
warms
your
palette
as
it
goes
down
but
without
the
burn
as
seen
in
other
high
abv
brews
this
one
is
highly
recommended
for
the
style
no
doubt
very
dark
indian
brown
in
color
small
thick
tan
head
malty
and
caramelized
aroma
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
at
first
but
this
was
when
it
was
chilly
as
it
warms
it
gets
very
tasty
very
malty
caramelized
and
syrupy
a
full
bodied
barleywine
the
first
barleywine
i
have
tried
so
i
cant
rate
it
against
much
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
but
probably
wont
buy
it
again
pours
out
a
blackish
brown
amber
with
a
very
nice
head
the
malts
come
through
strong
in
the
taste
this
is
a
very
smooth
brew
the
10
5
is
very
well
hidden
the
hops
are
a
bit
weak
but
there
are
enough
to
distract
from
the
sweet
try
this
beer
if
you
see
it
you
would
never
know
while
drinking
this
that
it
has
an
abv
of
10
5
dark
ruby
almost
black
color
head
disappears
no
lace
tastes
kind
of
like
a
cross
between
salvator
and
old
nicks
but
not
as
lively
or
good
as
either
of
those
more
malt
than
hops
but
overall
rather
undistinguished
nothing
to
put
you
off
but
nothing
stands
out
either
among
the
top
5
american
barleywines
but
frankly
were
a
bit
spoiled
they
are
so
many
topnotch
versions
and
the
best
acheivement
from
this
brewery
so
far
pours
with
a
giant
tan
head
the
head
quickly
dissolves
leaving
a
dark
brown
ale
with
strong
aroma
of
chocolate
taste
is
strong
on
malt
with
a
little
anise
in
the
back
and
finishes
with
a
little
spice
alcohol
is
definately
there
slightly
warming
the
gullet
on
the
way
down
the
beer
was
listed
at
the
pub
as
horn
dog
overpriced
barleywine
maybe
im
just
feeling
generous
but
id
pay
for
another
pint
very
nice
example
just
dont
look
for
a
lot
of
hops
dated
2001
got
this
at
jungle
jims
in
fairfield
oh
chestnut
colored
with
a
thick
beige
head
and
fair
carbonation
malt
and
alcohol
nose
i
must
have
had
this
at
a
good
temperature
because
i
thought
the
flavor
came
through
very
well
malt
caramel
chocolate
and
alcohol
played
well
together
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
to
drink
a
bottle
from
this
year
considering
how
good
this
one
tasted
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
white
head
smells
complex
with
raisony
kind
of
malt
smell
fruity
malty
intense
flavors
very
solid
taste
yet
you
cannot
detect
the
alcohol
a
real
good
beer
to
finish
the
evening
dark
brown
tealike
pour
practically
no
head
other
than
spider
web
tracks
a
little
fruit
mostly
grape
in
the
aroma
could
be
bolder
decent
mouthfeel
nice
and
syrupy
flavors
of
maraschino
cherry
apple
and
a
little
nutmeg
the
hops
are
actually
respectable
but
not
massive
and
give
a
little
gravel
to
the
back
maybe
a
little
less
complex
than
some
barleywines
it
still
matches
the
style
well
and
was
much
better
than
my
expectations
even
pretty
drinkable
pours
a
dark
garnet
almost
brown
with
a
huge
rocky
creamy
tan
head
that
last
but
somehow
doesnt
leave
any
lace
the
aroma
has
huge
caramel
malt
aromas
as
well
as
some
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
some
slight
alcohol
notes
the
brew
starts
off
with
some
intense
caramel
sweetness
that
turns
into
a
creamy
chocolate
flavor
for
a
short
time
before
going
into
a
raisinyprune
flavor
their
is
also
some
slight
fruity
tartness
in
the
taste
and
the
brew
finishes
with
lingering
sweetness
and
some
slight
alcohol
that
warms
you
throughout
the
brew
is
very
creamy
and
has
some
somewhat
chewy
qualities
to
it
as
well
which
make
it
very
drinkable
and
leaves
the
mouth
wanting
more
after
each
sip
i
have
previously
been
unimpressed
by
this
brewery
but
i
definitely
like
this
brew
quite
a
bit
brown
color
dissipating
head
big
malty
aroma
flavor
is
strong
malt
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
finsh
is
very
smooth
with
some
alcohol
evident
deceptively
strong
and
very
smooth
not
as
manly
as
bigfoot
i
want
more
hops
but
this
could
put
you
down
without
you
realizing
it
a
great
effort
this
beer
poured
a
dark
ruby
red
color
and
formed
a
small
light
tan
head
that
left
little
lace
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
an
aroma
of
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
was
of
malt
caramel
and
a
little
citrusy
hops
the
finish
was
warm
of
slight
alcohol
and
caramel
not
a
bad
barleywine
this
beer
is
a
murky
dark
dark
shade
of
ruby
a
little
swirl
of
a
head
is
gone
in
a
second
very
nice
sweet
malt
and
hops
blend
on
the
nose
there
seems
to
be
a
little
spice
as
well
this
is
a
really
nice
tasting
barleywine
i
am
surprised
as
few
of
the
other
flying
dog
brews
have
knocked
my
socks
off
although
they
have
been
decent
the
alcohol
is
only
present
in
a
minimal
fashion
there
are
subdued
notes
of
cherry
and
dark
fruits
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
but
not
over
the
top
as
the
bigfoot
is
theres
some
nice
caramel
and
vanilla
tones
its
not
syrupy
at
all
as
some
other
barleywines
are
i
also
get
some
prunes
and
currants
on
the
buds
very
nice
tasting
barleywine
cant
resist
commenting
on
the
label
on
this
one
most
of
this
line
is
weird
but
this
one
is
goofy
dog
with
a
gigantic
horn
growing
from
the
top
of
its
head
reminds
me
of
a
lowbudget
science
fiction
movie
where
the
monster
is
a
dog
or
iguana
with
a
fake
horn
stuck
on
its
head
notes
a
must
a
cellar
temp
drink
this
cold
and
feel
its
wrath
also
make
sure
the
yeast
does
not
make
its
way
into
the
glass
or
you
will
fell
sorry
that
it
did
as
soon
as
it
warms
up
the
malt
flares
out
the
with
pounding
sweetness
that
wrestles
with
the
hops
and
graininess
not
overly
impressive
but
good
enough
to
give
it
a
try
if
you
are
into
strong
beers
and
barleywines
minimal
hopping
very
malty
and
sweet
very
intersting
sweet
taste
warming
effect
but
doesnt
taste
of
alcohol
sweeter
beers
dont
get
downgraded
by
me
so
this
scores
will
if
youre
looking
for
a
heavily
hopped
and
malty
barley
wine
this
is
not
it
i
like
it
a
lot
but
the
sweetness
could
get
to
you
taste
of
brown
sugar
grapes
smells
of
alcohol
but
doesnt
taste
of
it
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
but
those
one
or
two
would
be
a
good
experience
this
isnt
a
worldclass
barleywine
but
still
quite
nice
to
drink
buy
a
few
and
lay
some
down
this
will
be
a
fun
one
to
watch
mature
what
strong
english
ales
aspire
to
unfortunately
a
little
bit
to
sweet
for
my
taste
very
flavorful
in
all
the
right
ways
deliciously
malty
not
very
bitter
the
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
grabbed
this
one
at
a
pub
in
paddington
thin
beige
cap
over
a
bronze
clear
beer
decent
retention
with
some
clinging
bubbles
super
fruity
aroma
dried
fruit
like
raisins
and
figs
along
with
a
nearly
tropical
character
and
sturdy
biscuit
malt
base
solid
bitterness
didnt
get
in
the
way
of
fruity
and
malty
flavors
as
well
as
a
bit
of
alcohol
nicely
balanced
between
hops
malt
and
yeast
a
bit
bready
biscuit
slight
caramel
dried
fruit
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
a
bit
drying
malty
texture
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
id
love
it
if
this
was
easier
to
get
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
overall
very
flavorful
but
pretty
sweet
overall
a
very
nice
strong
ale
bitterness
is
present
but
in
a
perfect
combination
with
malt
and
alcohol
one
of
my
favourites
definitely
a
great
english
ale
in
his

o

great

highly
recommended
an
excellent

and
one
that
really
packs
a
punch
with
a
well
hidden
alcohol
content
for
the
most
part
and
well
balanced
complimentary
flavours
a
great
beer
for
sipping
away
at
from
an
aus
perspective
almost
a
dead
ringer
for
coopers
vintage
o
not
a
stormer
for
sure
just
a
nicely
balanced
quite
refreshing
strong
ale
which
almost
feels
like
a
session
ale
reddish
copper
body
with
an
offwhite

minimal

only
some
modest

rich

a
sligth

and
some
dried
darker

is
similar
and
offers
a
bit
more

dried

and
caramel

dominate
and
establish
a
really
solid
and
quite
english

profile
modest
sweetness
and
a
subtle
dryness
and
bitterness
in
the

a
bit
of
alcohol
is
interwoven
within
the
flavour
and
adds
some
complexity
excellent
mouthfeel
and
completely
smooth
on
the
palate
an
excellent
english
strong

and
id
certainly
have
this
again
tremendously
disappointed
that
i
passed
on
this
when
bottles
were
available
at
the
lcbo
overall
would
be
a
great
fall
beer
bringing
to
mind
thoughts
of
pumpkin
or
sweet
potato
pie
very
well
balanced

nice

forward
english
strong

with

level
though
some
limited
complexity
fullers
golden
pride
contradicts
the
official
line
that
traditional
british
not
to
mention
big
brandname
beers
must
be
ordinary
and
plain
this
is
inspired
despite
retaining
its
classic
features
ive
said
it
before
but
ive
never
said
it
with
more
confidence
than
now
having
tried
this
there
may
be
no
better
brewery
in
britain
perhaps
the
world
than
fuller
o
ive
wondered
why
they
call
it
golden
pride
but
this
just
might
be
the
gold
standard
for
an
english
strong
ale
and
even
a
big
industrial
brewer
should
take
pride
in
that
o
a
tasty
ale
that
is
relatively
complex
and
flavourful
while
still
being
quite
drinkable
would
definitely
get
again
not
a
beer
style
id
choose
often
but
think
this
is
a
good
example
thereof
notes
good
medium
mouthfeel
one
of
the
beers
i
brought
home
from
the
brewery
i
wish
i
could
find
it
locally
i
concur
with
the
other
reviews
except
for
a
few
points
the
head
did
not
last
in
my
standard
british
pint
glass
it
fizzed
out
in
less
than
5
minutes
the
lacing
was
also
thin
the
flavour
is
big
with
complex
malts
upfront
and
a
good
balance
of
bitters
at
8

abv
this
is
not
a
wimpy
beer
yes
i
do
believe
i
will
have
another
later
overall
another
very
nice
beer
from
fullers
i
am
pretty
impressed
by
the
consistency
of
this
brewery
a
tasty
beer
that
is
remarkably
drinkable
despite
the
strength
od
really
easy
drinking
not
overly
complex
like
youd
find
in
a
lot
of
strong
ales
but
it
sure
does
the
trick
i
could
drink
this
all
day
worth
a
shot
keeping
with
fullers
quality
standards

by

some
raisin

dried

and
toffee

is
quite
rich
and
malty
mild

bitterness

with
nice

flavours
in
the

sweetness
as
well
lightly
syrupy
lightmed

fairly
full
bodied
solid
drinking
strong
and
flavourful
a
very
pleasant
beer
another
tremendously
drinkable
fullers
ale
that
should
be
bought
whenever
it
is
available
overall
this
is
basically
a
barleywine
great
full
flavour
and
perfect
to
drink
as
a
winter
warmer
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
and
i
didnt
have
to
go
far
to
get
it
which
is
a
bonus
pours
a
clear
copper
colour
into
an
english
pint
thin
but
creamy
offwhite
head
with
a
longlasting
cap
that
laces
well
smells
very
sweet
mostly
of
toffee
and
subtle
hints
of
fruit
and
nuts
sweet
toffee
and
bready
malt
flavours
up
front
which
are
quickly
overtaken
by
the
alcoholic
warmth
which
plays
off
of
the
faint
bitterness
the
alcohol
fades
into
a
slight
warming
finish
thats
accented
by
dark
fruit
and
nuts
soft
and
creamy
carbonation
decent
slightly
oily
body
a
delicious
sipper
that
straddles
the
boundary
between
english
strong
ales
and
barleywines
for
those
who
want
a
bit
more
out
of
their
pale
ales
but
dont
want
to
go
too
far
into
barleywine
territory
this
is
the
ticket
another
fine
brew
from
fullers
and
definitely
among
the
better
strong
ales
ive
come
across
making
this
one
a
christmas
brew
for
sure
d
a
bridge
between
strong
ales
and
barleywines
bursting
with
complex
fruitforward
flavours
while
keeping
a
wellbalanced
medium
body
seek
it
out
let
it
warm
and
sip
it
slowly
d
good
drink
great
first
beer
in
the
uk
i
really
like
the
taste
in
this
beer
its
well
balanced
and
has
a
very
traditional
barleywine
taste
could
have
had
more
body
overall
golden
pride
is
a
delectable
nuanced
cross
between
an
english
strong
ale
and
barley
wine
it
packs
all
the
flavours
of
the
latter
style
with
the
drinkability
of
the
former
just
a
beauty
of
a
beer
i
hope
the
lcbo
restocks
this
limited
release
so
i
can
grab
more
bottles
despite
classed
as
english
strong
ale
here
this
a
barleywine
and
rated
like
that
in
short

english
barleywine

into
tulip
as
far
as
i
can
remember
this
is
my
first
time
tasting
an
english
strong
ale
so
far
i
think
i
can
say
i
like
this
style
and
this
beer
in
particular
its
kind
of
like
a
light
barleywineand
i
mean
this
in
a
good
way
lots
of
nice
malty
fruity
flavor
but
lighter
body
and
a
bit
smoother
drinking
definitely
worth
trying
overall
a
really
nice
english
barleywine
old
ale
strong
ale
cant
deny
its
quality
distinct
from
1845
which
had
more
toffee
qualities
and
bittering
hops
this
is
its
big
less
subtle
brother
overall
a
nice
beer
nothing
to
complain
about
really
given
its
strength
im
surprised
it
doesnt
cost
more
id
drink
it
alone
to
reward
myself
or
on
a
nice
not
too
hectic
evening
with
friends
and
maybe
a
steady
meat
dish
instead
you
get
an
elegant
sexily
sweet
malt
driven
sipper
almost
like
melted
toffee
carbonation
is
nice
and
low
helping
this
puppy
slide
down
nice
and
smooth
alcohol
is
nicely
in
check
too
whats
not
to
like
still
its
a
good
warming
beer
picked
this
up

store
in
the
uk
beers
of
europe
ltd
cear
copperamber
pour
with
quickly
fading
two
finger
head
and
minimal
lacing
very
unique
nose
for
a
british
beer
it
was
typically
malty
but
also
had
a
strong
aroma
of
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
as
well
as
hints
of
biscuits
and
tea
the
taste
is
complex
full
bodied
and
rich
tons
of
oak
and
vanilla
with
hints
of
caramel
toffee
grape
skins
rum
and
a
touch
of
orange
peel
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
im
kicking
myself
for
only
grabbing
one
of
these
this
is
everything
the
fullers
vintage
should
be
and
isnt
for
less
than
half
the
price
cant
wait
for
my
next
visit
to
the
uk
soft
carbonation
could
be
higher
quite
impressed
by
the
head
retention
here
i
think
it
causes
confusion
with
more
potent
headless
barley
wines
like
thomas
hardys
ale
but
this
is
most
definitely
a
barley
wine
and
a
good
introduction
to
the
english
style
as
well
very
fine
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
english
strong
ale
near
barley
wine
style
85
abv
this
was
a
real
ale
cask
a
bit
past
its
prime
you
can
feel
the
heaviness
in
your
mouth
both
from
flavours
as
from
the
alcohol
the
stomach
positively
feels
warm
and
glows
while
drinking
this
brew
if
one
is
used
to
beers
you
can
drink
one
after
another
you
have
to
stop
and
reconsider
here
this
is
a
one
for
the
winter
night
fireplace
beer
only
notes
best
before
010111
a
solid
beer
that
is
a
good
example
of
an
english
strong
ale
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
has
enough
to
counterbalance
that
dangerously
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
it
didnt
necessarily
blow
me
away
but
it
is
definitely
worth
getting
a
deserve
a
place
near
the
top
as
far
as
english
strong
ales
are
concerned
not
a
bad
strong
ale
i
agree
with
an
earlier
reviewer
that
this
is
almost
a
barley
wine
on
cask
at
bar
volo
pours
copper
to
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
head
the
nose
is
floral
with
a
touch
of
herbs
lots
of
bright
fruits
mild
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
vinegar
tastes
of
apricots
little
bready
some
grassy
undertones
sweet
and
caramel
tones
a
touch
of
whiskey
its
a
heavy
mouthfeel
nice
and
thick
a
little
chewy
full
bodied
and
the
alcohol
isnt
too
brash
very
balanced
in
the
cask
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
from
fullers
whatever
style
it
is
pssst
its
a
barley
wine
over
all
a
great
beer
that
surprised
me
as
it
was
really
cheap
here
in
sweden
and
the
last
time
i
tried
it
i
have
a
hazy
memory
of
me
almost
pouring
it
down
the
drain
due
to
being
too
sickish
and
cloyingy
sweet
reminds
me
greatly
of
a
one
to
two
year
old
bigfoot
however
as
this
is
more
than
likely
more
traditional
maybe
it
should
be
the
other
way
around
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
pretty
damn
smooth
for
the
abv
and
works
great
on
cask
good
work
ralph
getting
firkins
of
this
stuff
much
better
in
the
bottle
2
years
later
and
that
is
the
rerate
good
caramel
and
sweetness
there
are
few
beers
in
the
world
better
than
a
well
made
english
strong
ale
and
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
i
take
my
hat
off
to
fullers
this
is
one
well
crafted
beer
and
well
worth
the
extra
couple
of
pence
i
paid
for
it
this
is
a
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
savoured
like
a
fine
brandy
or
whiskey
even
though
i
feel
that
some
more
variations
in
taste
are
left
to
be
desired
it
is
still
a
fine
brew
overall
certainly
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
was
tasty
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
abv
with
only
the
rough
and
aggressive
palate
holding
it
back
in
the
ratings
for
me
the
back
of
the
bottle
reads
this
is
the
finest
example
of
our
brewers
art
and
id
certainly
like
to
commend
them
on
their
fine
masterpiece
recommended

quite

its

a
good

beer
in

a
good

quite
some

for

in

too
quickly
im
thinking
aging
would
help
to
bring
things
together
but
thats
just
a
guess
as
it
is
it
is
sweet
and
boozy
turning
quickly
to

it

you
ask

a

nothing
spectacular
its
slightly

isnt
really
that
overly
prominent

still
it
doesnt
feel
totally

with

good
beer
though
in
the
mouth
you
get
slapped
with
a
big
body
and
kick
of
booze
once
you
get
passed
that
its
great
strong
nutty
flavor
toasted
grain
with
caramel
and
toffee
notes
make
this
a
stronger
pale
ale
to
my
taste
but
a
well
constructed
one
some
fruity
undertones
beneath
the
stomach
warms
up
the
further
i
go
along
this
is
just
a
damn
good
ale
being
used
to
beer
which
one
can
just
drink
and
drink
again
i
had
to
adjust
my
sights
a
little
personally
bearing
in
mind
the
sheer
amount
of
flavour
packed
into
the
brew
i
regard
it
more
as
a
barley
wine
rather
than
a
beer
semantics
perhaps
but
thats
how
i
see
it
mouthfeel
was
smooth
overall
a
fairly
complex
and
strong
warming
earthy
brew
had
to
have
one
of
these
when
i
saw
it
in
the
fridge
in
a
fullers
in
north
greenwich
this
is
one
of
the
best
english
beers
ive
ever
had
pours
a
rich
goldyred
a
wonderfully
vivid
colour
with
minimal
head
smell
is
not
hugely
strong
but
sweet
and
fruity
it
was
perhaps
a
bit
too
cold
ive
never
quite
discovered
the
best
temperature
to
serve
this
beer
at
but
there
are
a
lot
of
fruit
flavours
in
here
with
the
satisfying
alcoholic
kick
coming
in
towards
the
finish
superbly
wellbalanced
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
nowhere
near
as
heavy
as
most
barley
wines
and
dangerously
drinkable
youll
find
it
an
effort
of
will
to
go
back
to
a
weaker
beer
after
this
fullers
golden
pride
is
a
very
good
example
that
strong
ales
can
be
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
the
taste
is
very
malty
but
with
a
kick
of
hops
and
to
my
suprise
not
a
heavy
ale
this
is
one
of
my
prefered
barley
wines
and
its
so
easy
to
forget
how
strong
they
are
and
have
a
few
to
many
well
done
fullers
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easy
not
too
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
could
stick
with
for
the
duration
of
the
evening
pazzos
took
the
ole
winter
ale
off
tap
for
a
few
hours
to
share
this
treasure
of
a
beer
with
their
patrons
certainly
glad
i
was
there
this
beer
is
quite
special
reminding
me
of
the
vintage
ales
with
a
more
subdued
alcohol
complex
and
power
in
the
flavors
the
first
sip
delivers
a
plethera
of
complexity
tons
of
flavors
and
spicy
character
certainly
rests
on
a
foundation
built
on
malts
shows
a
lot
of
cottoncandy
sweetness
berries
cherries
dates
figs
plumbs
nuts
caramel
and
lightly
toasted
breads
balanced
by
firm
pungent
hops
with
a
faint
herbal
tone
alcohols
are
warming
but
weave
nicely
into
the
complex
malts
until
they
are
hardly
noticed
finishes
sweet
but
balanced
and
with
a
long
sherrylike
lingering
drinkability
a
powerful
and
complex
beer
rich
and
satisfying
however
its
strength
and
richness
makes
this
beer
not
for
all
occasions
perhaps
as
an
digestif
or
as
a
winter
warmer
to
combat
cold
conditions
this
inflexibility
marks
it
down
in
my
personal
tastes
this
is
a
clearly
well
crafted
beer
balanced
matured
and
all
but
i
just
dont
appreciate
the
style
enough
to
give
it
a
higher
grade
and
in
fact
i
prefer
the
strong
ale
from
swedish
brewery
slottskällans
oxidation
is
mildly
apparent
with
a
wet
cardboard
aftertaste
and
freshers
days
have
since
passed
but
all
in
all
she
held
up
pretty
damn
good
overall
a
nice
warming
brew
for
sipping
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
recommended
m
very
rich
yet
smooth
on
the
palate
thankfully
not
too
sharp
for
its
high
alc
strength
100
body
no
more
no
less
while
the
rich
flavour
is
tuned
quite
nicely
to
make
it
rather
easy
to
sip
an
impressive
beer
by
the
fullers
it
used
to
be
available
only
in
330ml
bottles
around
four
years
ago
as
i
remember
it
and
now
it
comes
in
bigger
bottles
maybe
due
to
higher
popularity
i
reckon
but
this
beer
is
best
to
be
shared
bw
buddies
over
a
fireside
chat
otherwise
it
could
trick
people
to
consume
too
much
without
even
feeling
the
strength
acquired
at
sainsburys
vauxhall
a
supermarket
in
london
last
may
been
in
the
fridge
ever
since
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
brown
belying
the
golden
on
the
label
then
again
i
didnt
think
this
was
going
to
be
a
pale
beer
aroma
is
sweet
with
slight
caramels
and
a
dry
smell
that
im
attributing
to
the
hops
big
caramel
and
toffee
with
very
bitter
earthy
hops
in
there
huge
almost
like
a
proper
english
version
of
arrogant
bastard
call
him
a
rough
yob
kind
of
like
drinking
candy
sweet
and
malty
and
yum
and
yum
and
yum
balanced
with
the
hops
but
not
like
the
licorice
taste
of
1845
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
proper
and
drinkability
goes
through
the
roof
with
its
lovely
english
character
pretty
scrumptious

interesting

warming
mouthfeel

from

abv
beer
a
very
good
strong
ale
as
far
as
it
being
a
scotch
wee
heavy
methinks
not
more
a
strong
ale
or
barely
wine
very
potent
alcohol
on
the
breath
not
something
youd
want
to
even
touch
if
your
driving
this
is
a
big
beer
that
has
a
great
taste
sadly
i
think
the
alcohol
is
way
to
overwhelming
but
its
nice
to
sit
and
sip
on
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
medium
amounts
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
fine
but
a
bit
encumbered
by
a
spicy
alcohol
aftertaste
over
all
a
very
great
beer
though
not
as
great
as
the
label
claims
that
goes
for
fullers
esb
the
smell
is
strong
mostly
honey
with
some
hints
of
hops
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
thick
and
doughy
with
a
pleasant
tingly
hoppy
aftertaste
not
much
depth
to
this
but
otherwise
a
nice
beer
what
a
lovely
colour
this
beer
has
it
pours
a
amber
colour
into
the
glass
with
a
medium
thick
head
that
disappear
quickly
leaving
a
thin
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
big
fruity
smell
with
hints
of
caramel
and
fudge
it
has
a
rich
bittreness
in
the
taste
and
also
some
fruity
taste
some
hints
of
orange
even
some
caramel
in
the
after
taste
it
is
a
strong
beer
but
you
only
feel
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
like
the
name
says
it
is
pride
of
fullers
dont
confuse
with
a
scotch
heavy
ale
after
all
my
talk
of
caramel
malt
this
is
much
lighter
in
colour
and
texture
someone
mentioned
golden
syrup
and
that
does
seem
a
fairly
good
analogue
just
with
a
little
more
depth
of
flavour
than
the
aforementioned
syrup
its
very
good
i
like
it
o
over
a
year
of
cellering
has
produced
a
wonderful
cherrycaramel
forward
sipper
i
had
the
irish
walker
on
spanish
cedar
and
it
was
awesome
this
is
equally
as
wonderful
2014
release
pours
a
dark
brown
just
like
a
porter
normal
head
volume
and
retention
excellent
lacing
dark
fruit
nose
of
plums
raisins
and
dates
over
a
light
note
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
molasses
is
evident
along
with
a
caramel
note
light
full
body
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
slightly
below
normal
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
effervescence
in
the
finish
buttresses
the
bodytexture
the
flavor
profile
is
intense
very
complex
and
reasonably
balanced
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
blended
dark
fruits
that
flow
into
a
molasses
sweetness
in
the
middle
the
molasses
fades
into
a
caramel
note
that
is
rather
sweet
and
covers
the
alcohol
that
lurks
underneath
while
reasonably
covered
the
alcohol
still
exhibits
a
slight
astringency
in
the
middle
in
the
finish
alcohol
dominates
and
leaves
that
nice
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
as
it
all
fades
away
it
is
a
bit
dry
and
prune
notes
are
detected
im
not
a
big
barley
wine
fan
but
this
one
hits
the
outstanding
mark
drinking
2012
vintage
with
blue
wax
on
bottle
probably
the
best
barleywine
ive
had
very
nice
flavor
surprisingly
smooth
overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer
by
one
of
my
favorite
local
brewers
i
may
have
to
grab
a
few
more
up
to
cellar
before
they
are
gone
again
one
note
they
have
just
began
the
transition
to
12
6
packs
and
they
have
changed
the
label
style
personally
i
kind
of
like
the
older
labels
i
noticed
the
lindley
park
which
was
one
of
their
more
sought
after
beers
had
the
wax
omitted
and
i
suspect
the
event
horizon
will
too
this
may
be
the
last
of
the
shall
i
say
reserve
beers
from
them
that
has
the
wax
coating
around
the
cap
if
that
interests
you
i
doubt
next
years
will
have
it
4
5
m
many
detected
a
medium
body
but
i
detect
both
heavy
body
and
thin
body
varying
in
between
sips
o
i
really
enjoyed
irish
walker
and
it
makes
me
want
to
look
through
the
cellar
to
find
my
other
bottle
2011
vintage
and
give
it
a
try
to
see
how
long
i
should
hang
onto
this
in
the
future
overall
a
good
english
barleywine
on
the
hoppier
side
for
the
style
but
in
a
good
way
definetly
a
good
value
from
what
i
hear
it
costs
and
a
good
year
round
big
beer
itd
be
a
good
beer
to
throw
in
the
cellar
and
play
around
with
i
thoroughly
enjoy
a
good
english
style
barleywine
and
irish
walker
is
just
that
the
complexity
is
immense
the
depth
staggering
the
nevermind
its
good
go
get
some
this
was
a
nice
purchase
from
my
trip
to
asheville
nc
recommended
by
the
good
people
at
appalachian
vintner
drinking
from
an
old
hickory
glass
at
room
temperature
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
and
like
a
previous
reviewer
mentioned
has
the
woody
old
ale
quality
a
little
sweet
but
definitely
not
overpowering
personally
i
feel
it
is
well
balanced
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
definitely
would
buy
it
again
if
i
get
a
chance
to
go
to
nc
oh
yeah
that
blue
wax
covering
the
bottle
top
is
interesting
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
thick
for
easy
removal
poured
a
reddish
copper
with
two
finger
head
and
lace
ring
down
glass
boozy
alkie
aroma
with
bourbon
wood
hint
of
vanilla
caramelsugary
goodiness
and
touches
of
dark
fruits
mostly
figs
and
toffee
fuller
bodied
chewey
pronounced
alcohol
bite
with
a
touch
of
burn
on
backend
this
is
a
slow
sipper
bc
it
will
hit
you
and
hit
hard
that
being
said
well
balanced
not
overpowering
in
any
sense
love
the
dark
fruit
and
sweetness
that
balances
with
the
alcohol
and
wood
for
a
quality
barley
wine
would
love
to
see
how
this
ages
so
i
guess
im
buying
another
bottle
o
overall
really
great
english
barleywine
this
sort
of
tows
the
line
of
old
ale
really
what
i
love
about
the
english
barleywine
style
this
is
a
keeper
would
definitely
have
again
smooth
full
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
tasty
beer
with
nicely
varied
malt
character
i
like
it
though
some
might
find
it
overly
sweet
o
a
very
roasty
barleywine
with
a
lot
of
good
attributes
but
none
that
shine
too
bright
the
metallic
aftertaste
takes
its
toll
and
oxidation
is
starting
to
creep
in
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
it
wasnt
exactly
memorable
o
very
good
barleywine
hits
all
the
classic
notes
of
the
style
something
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
again
and
see
how
it
develops
overtime
o
good
example
of
the
style
othis
is
a
very
mellow
barley
wine
not
overpowering
with
either
the
malts
or
the
hops
which
is
nice
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
and
makes
this
beer
unique
nice
solid
enjoyable
barleywine
not
phenomenal
but
a
nice
beer
to
drink
solo
in
an
evening
overall
it
does
remind
me
of
caramel
but
slightly
burnttoo
toasted
at
that
so
it
is
good
but
not
outstanding
great
decadent
fruity
flavors
of
fig
plum
and
raisin
the
alcohol
add
just
enough
heat
to
this
but
in
no
way
overpowers
sweet
candylike
flavors
on
the
back
end
keep
this
balanced
and
tone
down
the
richness
of
it
a
bit
bitterness
is
present
but
again
subtlety
is
king
definitely
sets
itself
apart
from
the
americanized
versions
of
this
style
this
was
rich
tasty
and
ever
so
easy
to
drink
i
think
i
need
to
pull
the
trigger
on
some
bottles
now
o
i
dont
care
what
many
others
have
said
on
here
at
all
i
personally
thought
this
was
one
of
the
best
english
bws
ive
had
in
a
long
time
o
starts
out
well
but
the
aftertaste
is
kind
of
odd
for
a
beer
like
this
tasty
enough
but
nothing
earthshattering
lots
of
leather
between
sips
become
annoying
especially
strong
once
it
warms
up
o
good
barleywine
but
nothing
spectacular
after
saw
this
was
a
gusher
i
was
worried
about
infection
but
seems
ok
to
me
malty
sweetness
fades
into
booze
and
bourbon
more
spice
than
i
expected
spikes
of
alcohol
keep
things
interesting
unfortunately
it
doesnt
all
piece
together
as
well
as
its
competition
slightly
above
average
but
nothing
special
i
almost
wonder
if
this
was
just
not
quite
big
enough
for
cellering
much
more
than
a
year
or
so
mucho
points
for
the
weirding
ive
never
had
a
barleywine
like
this
before
its
felony
drinkable
with
that
10
abv
another
winner
from
olde
hickory
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
it
has
good
flavor
and
very
good
balance
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
hits
with
a
bang
the
first
thing
my
tongue
was
able
to
sort
out
was
a
solid
dose
of
bitterness
that
locks
into
every
tastebud
well
into
the
finish
a
heavy
dose
of
dark
fruit
complement
the
bitterness
nicely
definitely
more
balanced
than
the
nose
would
suggest
clean
alcohols
contribute
to
complexity
i
also
get
some
toffee
notes
as
things
settle
down
this
one
defines
a
sipper
really
full
viscous
mouthfeel
but
even
after
a
year
that
bitterness
is
pretty
upfront
solid
barleywine
that
will
really
develop
well
over
the
years
i
have
a
2012
that
i
think
i
will
hold
onto
for
much
longer
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
molasses
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
slight
brown
sugar
and
molasses
flavors
there
is
a
medium
sort
of
medicinal
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
but
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
weird
on
this
one
m
the
mouthfeel
is
a
malt
assault
syrupy
and
rich
i
recommend
splitting
it
with
someone
or
two
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
that
i
had
no
expectations
of
going
into
a
little
too
sweet
once
it
warmed
but
still
enjoyable
a
solid
if
unspectacular
barleywine
with
little
complexity
but
a
nice
sweet
body
with
some
fruity
notes
i
always
look
forward
to
the
irish
walker
this
being
the
2011
brew
the
foam
is
medium
brown
and
nice
lacing
durung
the
taste
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
full
malt
slight
sweetness
and
some
hoppiness
with
nice
finish
of
alcohol
the
feel
is
full
of
flavor
and
very
good
overall
as
i
said
before
i
always
look
forward
to
an
irish
walker
barleywine
by
olde
hickory
this
was
decent
the
complexity
seemed
to
be
there
but
the
flavors
themselves
just
didnt
leave
much
of
a
bold
impression
on
me
which
coupled
with
the
thinner
feel
of
the
body
to
make
for
a
moderately
enjoyable
but
ultimately
forgettable
drinking
experience
this
one
seemed
liked
its
spent
enough
time
in
the
bottle
already
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
the
flavor
is
not
robust
and
in
my
opinion
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
i
enjoy
the
beer
but
was
hoping
for
more
give
it
a
shot
but
dont
expect
to
get
wowd
o
a
great
beer
i
find
myself
ordering
again
and
again
good
job
ohb
i
have
yet
to
enjoy
aged
i
bet
it
will
improve
10
fold
o
this
is
real
good
not
overly
complex
but
crazy
smooth
and
well
balanced
the
flavors
work
from
start
to
finish
with
no
single
characteristic
shoving
its
way
to
the
forefront
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
smooth
full
body
crisp
middle
lingering
bitter
ends
o
nice
flavorful
english
barleywine
a
touch
boozy
nice
flavors
rich
tastes
of
oak
and
vanilla
hints
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
lots
of
bourbon
like
flavors
swirling
around
very
tight
and
nicely
done
a
bit
of
alcohol
just
enough
to
thicken
it
up
a
bit
a
really
nice
and
very
full
barley
wine
finish
was
strong
with
a
healthy
dose
of
bourbon
and
spice
lingering
in
the
mouth
for
what
seemed
like
forever
overall
a
delicious
english
barleywine
overall
very
nice
great
fruits
hint
of
whisky
and
barrel
good
sweetness
and
malts
balanced
fairly
well
overall
pretty
tasty
not
a
great
but
an
enjoyable
brew
o
pretty
good
english
barleywine
although
not
overly
complex
i
would
drink
this
again
but
there
are
better
out
there
o
sat
on
this
one
for
a
while
and
worth
the
wait
not
my
hands
down
favorite
english
barleywine
but
definately
will
be
looking
for
this
again
pretty
good
all
around
i
like
it
now
and
i
think
it
could
hold
up
over
time
overall
not
a
bad
english
barleywine
but
it
doesnt
rock
my
socks
off
overall
this
one
kinda
makes
me
think
of
an
imperial
irish
red
ale
though
maybe
im
taking
too
much
away
from
the
word
irish
decent
flavor
though
the
appearance
and
texture
were
quite
nice
d
one
is
definitely
enough
this
was
much
better
than
i
expected
its
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
and
that
sweetness
keeps
any
hoppiness
or
alcohol
well
in
check
would
love
to
drink
this
again
its
chewy
as
is
often
the
case
for
barleywines
you
feel
them
more
than
you
taste
them
its
a
maltsided
barleywine
so
even
new
and
fresh
theres
little
bitterness
what
can
i
say
i
all
too
often
want
more
hops
its
balanced
and
its
candied
barleyness
warms
the
gut
to
its
credit
the
beer
avoids
chalky
and
chemical
despite
its
big
body
and
10
abv
tastes
good
and
really
feels
even
better
overall
im
pretty
pleased
3
5
d
the
sweetness
to
bitterness
balance
is
tilted
heavily
toward
bitterness
this
might
have
been
the
design
for
all
i
know
though
i
heard
this
ages
well
and
would
the
strong
bitterness
now
will
prevent
this
from
getting
cloying
down
the
road
anyway
this
is
a
decent
drink
fresh
i
have
another
bottle
so
i
might
check
it
out
again
a
few
years
down
the
road

vintage
served
from
tap
into
a
flared
pilsner
poured
a
deep
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
slight
light
brown
hue
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
bitter
hop
sweet
alcohol
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
sweet
alcohol
caramel
and
bitter
hop
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
flavor
profile
on
this
one
was
quite
nice
and
complex
with
this
being
a
barleywine
it
had
all
of
the
flavors
one
would
expect
to
find
in
one
without
a
doubt
the
aroma
was
quite
nice
as
well
for
the
style
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
chance
pours
dark
brown
with
a
short
tan
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
thin
collar
the
nose
brings
some
light
whiskey
character
along
with
caramel
and
a
bit
of
booze
nothing
much
else
than
that
this
is
especially
apparent
in
the
flavor
which
unfortunately
tastes
mostly
like
watereddown
whiskey
and
doesnt
have
malt
or
other
backing
light
to
medium
body
without
too
much
booze
which
is
fairly
impressive
decent
enough
overall
but
id
rather
stick
with
some
of
their
other
beers
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
barleywine
and
something
i
would
love
to
have
again
sometime
lots
of
caramel
and
vanilla
which
are
some
of
my
favorite
characteristics
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brownish
red
murky
colour
with
a
decent
sized
fluffy
white
head
average
lacing
with
a
few
rings
left
behind
the
nose
is
a
heavy
sweetness
of
caramel
and
candied
sugar
this
beer
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggests
nice
dark
fruit
body
plums
raisins
with
some
accompanying
hoppy
bitterness
pine
the
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
is
definitely
still
there
but
more
of
a
supporting
role
well
balanced
beer
with
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
but
it
is
still
a
touch
hot
as
it
is
still
young
i
would
like
to
get
another
bottle
and
open
it
in
3
years
or
so
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
it
wont
get
me
to
go
rushing
out
to
find
more
if
given
the
opportunity
to
get
more
i
would
just
dont
feel
the
need
to
search
it
out
though
butterscotch
caramel
a
touch
of
toffee
in
the
nose
raisinstudded
bread
pudding
comes
to
mind
a
surpsing
bitter
streak
cuts
through
the
smoothish
and
coating
blend
of
butterscotch
molasses
toffee
and
fruit
the
hops
are
jacked
to
a
surprising
level
this
is
a
beer
that
very
well
may
respond
well
to
aging
after
the
swallow
the
bitterness
calms
down
and
the
smoothness
returns
for
the
afterparty
could
stand
to
be
a
touch
more
warming
and
perhaps
with
age
it
would
be
easy
recommendation
overall
so
a
year
older
and
with
a
2
lower
abv
the
2009
is
clearly
the
better
beer

you
simply
must
check

the
beer
pours
a

the
aroma
is
brown
sugar

and
roasted

the
flavor
is

shorter
end
of
the
spectrum
with
its
less
than
domineering
level
of

it
is
a
damn
good
english
barleywine
d
this
kind
of
grew
on
me
after
a
bit
i
was
not
a
huge
fan
at
first
but
i
recapped
the
brew
and
had
several
pours
over
a
twoday
period
and
found
it
to
be
quite
nice
after
a
while
dmessy
and
slightly
oxidized
already
very
singular
with
a
dirty
malt
overload
not
offensive
but
certainly
not
good
notes
an
interesting
twist
on
the
barleywine
style
and
unique
for
sure
its
a
little
cloying
though
despite
the
dark
chewy
flavors
there
is
a
certain
lifted
quality
to
the
beer
which
is
great
and
helps
keep
it
from
being
totally
syrupy
this
one
turns
into
a
sipper
rather
quickly
and
not
because
of
a
heavy
body
or
high
alcohol
content

kinf
of
surprised
me
ive
only
tried
the
imperial
stout
from
olde
hickory
and
that
was
phenomenal
now
i
try
this
one
which
is
not
rated
amazingly
on

but
this
brew
is
really
awesome
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
you
like
big
beers
and
barleywines
i
think
i
want
to
try
some
more
brews
from
oh
now
it
is
one
to
sip
drinkability
is
also
good

finished
my
glass
without
any
problems
and
could
have
another

this

i
like
this
better
than
the
draft
version
i
had
last
summer
this
is
a
faithful
take
on
the
style
that
is
working
for
me
i
am
digging
the
bigger
bottled
beers

pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
aroma
of
molasses
sweetness
and
slight
dark
fruits
taste
follows
with
a
light
sweetness
and
moderate
spice
pretty
true
to
style
in
the
taste
department
but
the
mouth
is
way
thin
finishes
fairlyclean
for
a
barleywine
overall
a
good
interpretation
of
an
english
barleywine
but
a
little
too
light
to
be
called
great
enjoyable
barleywine
that
might
need
a
few
months
of
age
to
tone
down
the
heat
this
is
more
like
a
scotch
ale
but
for
a
barleywine
its
just
a
b
but
b
good
too
much
of
that
metallic
edge
comes
in
and
probably
too
fruitytart
as
well
but
theres
enough
here
to
make
it
worth
a
try
theres
a
really
good
beer
in
here
somewhere
and
at

its
not
gonna
totally
lay
you
flat
or
anything
22
oz
bottle
poured
a
nice
brown
color
with
good
head
and
lacing
i
have
come
to
realize
that
i
am
not
the
bigest
fan
of
barleywines
because
i
think
the
smell
and
taste
of
alcohol
stands
out
too
much
however
i
drank
sipped
this
during
the
boring
first
half
of
the
super
bowl
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
was
a
great
beer
to
just
sit
and
enjoy
during
a
long
first
half
of
a
football
game
i
am
not
sure
how
much
drinkability
this
one
has
because
of
the
alcohol
even
though
it
clocks
in
at
7
70
with
that
said
i
would
have
another
is
given
the
chance
nice
beer
for
the
style
i
highly
recommend
picking
bottles
of
this
up
but
you
have
to
get
it
from
the
brewery
in
hickory
well
worth
the
trip
up
there
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
a
rich
deep
amber
with
a
clingy
one
finger
slight
off

that
left
multiple
layers
of
broken
lace
deep

were

charitable
id
point
out
the
flavors
of

i
could
admit
this
is
just
overly

adjuncty

e
alcohol
basically
this
delivers
all
of

i
want
in

not

a

also
forgoes
some
of

had
no
idea
one
would
never
know
quite

now
i

i
have
to

of
it
to
compare
it
never

some
of
these
cheesy
christmas
beers

i
bought
last

served

around
for

as
raspberry
and
cherry
with
the
alcohol
coming
through
on
the
nose
in
the
end
the
taste
was
more
spicy
than
i
was
expecting
with
pepper
and
all
spice
in
the
beginning
before
mellowing
into
dark
fruits
and
tobacco
flavors
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
burn
but
this
was
surprisingly
drinkable
for
10
5
o
better
than
i
expected
but
a
bit
too
sweet
and
fruity
to
be
my
favorite
not
cloying
though
but
the
fruit
punch
flavor
is
a
bit
strange
the
mouthfeel
and
body
are
just
right
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
taste
is
clean
with
no
cloying
aftertaste
but
lacking
in
complexity
faint
caramel
and
malt
rjt
overall
in
a
nutshell
caramel
and
booze
no
hops
to
be
found
not
a
very
impressive
barleywine
though
somewhat
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
i
see
why
they
callbthis
criminally
bad
elf
because
it
is
crininally
bad
not
what
i
expect
from
a
barley
wine
style
brew
this
is
more
of
a
winter
warmer
with
banana
influence
a
search
and
rescue
team
is
required
to
find
the
barley
and
the
overall
delivery
is
not
great
i
think
this
beer
is
confused
on
what
it
wants
to
be
i
can
honestly
say
i
would
not
purchase
this
again
pours
a
light
copperorange
color
with
a
think
beige
colored
head
aroma
sweet
with
hints
of
bananas
booze
christmas
spice
and
hard
candy
this
beer
is
wayyy
to
sweet
and
i
have
had
some
great
sweet
barleywines
the
sweetness
helps
in
hiding
some
of
the
alcohol
taste
but
it
cant
cover
it
all
up
there
is
some
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
christmas
spice
body
is
kinda
thin
not
impressed
i
am
surprised
that
it
doesnt
rate
higher
than
it
does
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
o
good
to
try
once
a
lot
going
on
and
not
sure
that
it
all
comes
together
quite
like
they
hoped
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
some
this
to
me
is
the
quintessential
holiday
barleywine
its
got
all
of
the
barleywine
characteristics
and
a
little
extra
oomph
in
the
abv
department
and
some
sweet
and
spice
that
make
it
perfect
for
the
christmas
season
it
pours
a
whisley
color
with
a
bubbly
slow
tan
head
the
smell
is
alcohol
and
english
malts
caramel
and
walnuts
the
flavor
is
about
the
same
with
an
oaky
residue
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
i
like
the
upbeat
feel
if
it
too
its
a
little
more
carbonated
and
a
little
lighter
in
body
than
many
of
these
which
make
it
frightfully
quaffable
there
is
some
vanilla
and
bourbon
notes
in
the
finish
and
a
touch
of
allspice
or
anise
that
resounds
long
after
youve
swallowed
i
know
its
a
little
early
in
the
season
for
a
beer
like
this
but
i
cant
help
myself
sometimes
its
way
underrated
on
ba
and
is
overall
one
of
my
favorite
wintertime
barleywines
smells
very
strongly
at
first
of
tropical
mango
and
papaya
with
medium
amounts
of
mandarin
oranges
and
a
toffee
biscuit
malt
blend
the
flavor
is
more
centered
around
a
burntsugar
malt
and
boozesoaked
orange
peel
and
raisins
the
tropical
hopping
from
the
nose
is
completely
buried
underneath
the
boozey
rawness
its
not
put
together
quite
as
well
as
id
hoped
it
plays
out
like
an
american
barleywine
with
most
of
the
hopping
flavor
truncated
and
slightly
out
of
control
astringent
hotness
even
so
ive
had
far
worse
than
this
before
i
need
a
scotch
the
only
criminally
bad
element
of
this
is
what
is
in
the
bottle
not
on
the
label
overall
a
boldly
sweet
barleywine
with
a
nice
strong
fruity
presence
o
not
bad
not
great
very
traditional
quite
forgettable
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
clear
rubycopper
coloring
with
a
thin
ring
of
film
around
the
perimeter
of
the
surface
the
nose
is
a
total
malt
bomb
with
a
slight
roasting
to
accompany
caramel
toffee
and
pineapple
sweetness
definitely
some
boozey
characteristics
from
the
increased
abv
also
flavors
are
mild
with
pineapple
and
tropical
fruits
first
onto
the
tongue
and
a
smokey
roast
quality
throughout
the
sweetness
turns
tangy
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
with
a
slight
peppery
hopping
to
clean
it
all
up
the
aftertaste
is
syrupy
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
to
it
but
not
much
the
finish
is
slick
and
slightly
lingering
with
a
little
bit
of
a
cloying
feeling
in
mouth
meh
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
paletteable
for
a
warming
beer
in
the
winter
months
its
passable
the
sweetness
and
buttery
character
is
not
overwhelming
doa
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
just
enough
of
a
boozy
bite
that
lets
you
know
that
this
is
a
barleywine
with
average
heat
medium
to
heavy
body
light
carbonation
and
a
sweet
chewy
grainy
feel
that
accents
the
malty
earthy
ingredients
a
very
enjoyable
winter
warmer
and
a
solid
barleywine
nice
seasonal
style
to
sip
o
unfortunately
this
one
falls
flat
on
its
face
i
unfortunately
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
i
will
definitely
give
this
one
another
try
next
year
to
see
if
it
changes
and
will
revise
my
reviews
accordingly
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
taste
is
mostly
boozy
but
not
harsh
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
not
a
complex
barleywine
but
it
had
enough
to
keep
me
interested
overall
tasty
but
not
exceptional
i
could
see
drinking
this
again
but
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
o
this
is
okay
nothing
special
and
the
smell
is
faint
enough
to
be
average
probably
wouldnt
get
again
but
not
bad
to
drink
the
beer
is
a
clear
amber
hue
with
a
big
creamy
head
floating
above
it
this
cap
of
foam
is
impressive
for
the
style
creamy
with
tons
of
lacing
the
carbonation
keeps
the
foam
stoked
the
aroma
is
inviting
with
some
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
fruit
heavy
on
the
palate
as
expected
for
the
style
malt
all
over
the
place
in
the
flavorbready
caramel
fruitywith
the
deftest
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
it
seems
that
the
sweetness
is
somehow
additionally
balanced
by
a
hint
of
starch
in
the
graina
good
thing
some
fruity
esters
emerge
as
the
beer
warms
and
the
booze
begins
to
hold
court
this
would
be
a
wonderful
sipper
along
side
a
crackling
fireplace
immersed
in
a
dickens
novel
but
alas
it
is
july
with
a
warming
grill
and
baseball
on
the
radio
to
hell
with
itall
these
rules
governing
craft
beer
and
its
seasonal
pendulum
swings
lets
get
together
and
agree
that
barleywine
or
even
a
summer
ale
should
be
a
yearround
brew
why
must
we
wait
for
the
good
stuff
overall
impression
while
aged
for
at
least
half
a
year
one
of
my
first
aged
beers
ive
opened
this
was
great
im
wondering
if
this
is
a
beer
people
should
age
because
my
experience
was
awesome
with
it
could
drink
1
or
2
in
a
night
and
certainly
was
rich
complexed
and
had
a
lot
of
character
something
you
should
look
for
overall
this
was
a
great
purchase
huge
flavor
not
sure
why
the
belgian
elements
have
been
so
prominent
from
this
brewery
but
then
again
i
havent
checked
their
website
or
anything
only
paid
three
bucks
for
the
bomber
a
thoroughly
mediocre
sipper
beer
useful
only
as
a
oneoff
nightcap
and
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
that
answer
to
that
description
too
boozy
and
too
sweet
for
anyting
else
a
disappointment
overall
i
continue
to
be
disapointed
by
this
elf
series
they
seem
like
more
of
a
gimmick
o
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
its
not
my
favorite
in
the
category
but
its
not
bad
either
worth
a
pick
up
if
you
want
to
try
something
new
but
if
you
have
better
options
id
go
w
the
other
options
prior
to
this
beer
the
only
other
barley
wine
i
had
tried
was
skull
splitter
from
scotland
i
found
that
this
brew
wasnt
as
good
nut
it
could
have
been
much
worse
this
beer
offers
up
a
big
time
abv
that
surely
tells
you
this
is
not
a
walk
in
the
park
the
taste
is
boozie
and
fairly
strong
with
malts
througout
the
color
was
on
the
amberish
side
all
in
all
not
my
favorite
barley
wine
nut
its
worth
giving
it
a
try
notes
just
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
young
for
sure
but
even
time
in
the
cellar
wont
fix
this
beer
lacks
body
and
malt
depth
two
very
essential
parts
of
the
style
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
at
all
d
i
would
tire
easily
but
fun
to
try
d
the
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
its
strength
because
for
the
most
part
the
alcohol
is
masked
from
the
taste
d
great
english
barleywine
wish
it
was
around
all
year
opinion
again
to
be
fair
to
this
beer
my
sniffer
isnt
in
the
best
shape
and
this
is
obviously
affecting
my
sense
of
flavor
as
well
as
i
am
not
picking
up
the
details
in
this
beer
that
i
would
like
to
that
said
i
am
not
completely
numb
and
there
are
a
number
of
things
about
this
beer
that
are
mediocre
for
the
style
i
would
probably
try
a
sample
of
it
sometime
in
the
future
to
know
what
my
palate
missed
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
for
that
reason
as
i
feel
pretty
confident
that
i
am
not
missing
much
overall
this
beer
was
not
what
i
expected
i
was
definitely
looking
forward
to
a
big
beer
with
incredible
body
with
crazy
flavors
that
were
in
your
face
but
instead
i
got
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
lacked
in
any
real
complexity
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
due
to
the
price
point
but
if
offered
i
wouldnt
refuse
like
all
beers
of
this
style
its
hard
to
consider
it
highly
drinkable
its
very
strong
from
its
sweetness
to
its
heat
and
with
10
5
abv
you
wont
need
much
of
this
d
pretty
drinkable
for
10
5
cant
say
i
would
buy
again
d
a
decent
barley
wine
but
the
high
alcohol
keeps
me
from
drinking
much
strong
caramel
sweetness
to
the
taste
but
there
is
a
good
hop
counterpoint
that
prevents
this
from
being
too
cloy
good
body
with
an
appropriate
carbonation
level
the
alcohol
is
deceptively
light
but
the
impact
is
very
strong
recommended
to
anyone
that
enjoys
a
good
strong
brew
that
doesnt
come
across
as
strong
this
is
a
great
barleywine
style
brew
drinkability
not
a
bad
barleywine
somewhat
simple
and
yet
complex
at
the
same
time
decent
taste
and
fun
story
to
read
on
the
bottle
fairly
drinkable
id
definitely
have
it
again
if
someone
else
was
willing
to
foot
the
8
this
one
cost
for
500
mg
of
brew
d
not
a
bad
barleywine
by
any
means
but
not
the
best
either
decent
flavor
and
body
ive
noticed
the
aroma
on
most
ridgeway
beers
seem
to
be
a
bit
lacking
again
a
good
beer
but
not
one
i
will
be
waiting
each
holiday
season
for
medium
syrupy
with
a
sticky
sweetness
that
makes
you
want
to
brush
your
teeth
after
every
sip
the
cough
syrup
aroma
and
taste
is
too
offputting
to
mark
this
very
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
pours
a
light
copper
with
very
little
head
smell
is
a
nice
blend
of
malt
fruit
and
subdued
alcohol
presence
taste
is
tart
but
with
a
distinct
malt
presence
that
gives
a
good
blance
alcohol
is
there
but
no
way
resembles
10
5abv
mouthfeeli
is
very
good
for
the
style
aalmost
slightly
chewy
but
with
a
nice
warming
presence
this
lends
itself
to
an
easy
drinkability
factor
for
a
barleywine
d
one
at
a
time
its
a
sipper
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
medium
body
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
side
which
works
for
the
style
alcohol
warmth
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
also
keeps
this
as
a
nice
winter
sipper
not
bad
nice
example
of
the
english
style
notes
this
is
a
nicely
done
english
beer
the
christmas
themed
bottle
is
very
gimmicky
but
inside
is
a
finely
crafted
beer
i
would
certainly
pick
this
one
up
again
and
it
is
my
favorite
from
the
ridgeway
brewing
company
of
the
five
ridgeway
christmas
beers
i
tried
bad
elf
reindeer
revolt
criminally
bad
elf
santas
butt
and
warm
welcome
this
was
easily
the
best
it
is
the
only
one
i
would
even
consider
having
again
although
i
doubt
i
will
see
this
one
out
again
pours
a
deep
orange
copper
hue
into
my
chalice
glass
with
an
off
white
head
forming
thick
and
even
with
fine
detailed
lacing
aromatics
offer
up
some
fusel
alcohol
notes
with
a
light
citrus
booze
character
going
on
hops
have
a
creamy
floral
and
citric
aspect
coating
the
whole
experience
some
sweet
dark
fruit
notes
blend
in
as
well
they
just
seem
to
take
a
back
seat
next
to
the
rest
of
the
party
going
on
flavor
provides
a
deep
sweet
cereal
honey
tone
with
slight
syrup
notes
and
deep
raisin
and
caramel
malts
wafting
in
big
bitter
backing
from
the
english
perspective
the
citrus
and
tobacco
toned
hop
profile
adds
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
to
a
typically
hoppy
american
style
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
cloying
with
thick
layers
of
residual
sugars
sitting
around
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
mellow
but
it
doesnt
carry
the
big
body
around
too
well
drinkability
overall
is
pretty
poor
in
both
body
and
flavor
characteristics
maybe
next
time
i
will
dig
the
beers
from
this
seasonal
brewery
dark
orange
pouru
looks
pretty
good
and
by
that
i
mean
it
looks
like
its
gonna
be
mellow
banana
comes
out
first
some
other
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
earthiness
in
the
aroma
again
flavor
profile
dominated
by
a
dry
banana
flavor
dry
banana
though
way
better
than
wet
banana
an
unexpected
estery
flavor
from
this
beer
but
not
bad
in
the
context
it
was
had
in
im
gonna
give
this
beer
the
benefit
of
being
on
the
tail
end
of
two
great
imperial
stouts
choklat
and
dark
horizon
which
may
have
actually
improved
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
i
dont
know
that
it
wouldve
worked
as
well
but
maybe
the
same
flavors
wouldnt
have
shown
through
the
same
way
this
beer
mayve
been
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
but
i
will
certainly
have
it
again
perhaps
same
set
and
setting
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
lack
of
bodymouthfeel
warming
alcohol
is
present
for
several
minutes
after
swallowing
i
love
barleywines
but
this
one
is
average
dat
10
5
you
wouldnt
know
it
it
goes
down
easy
but
im
sure
it
will
hit
me
in
a
matter
of
minutes
d
this
was
a
nice
compliment
to
a
cold
and
snowy
evening
a
bit
more
complexity
and
a
better
masking
of
the
alcohol
would
have
made
this
more
enjoyable
to
me
however
poured
an
amber
color
i
really
caught
some
apples
and
some
sweet
malts
with
the
aroma
as
far
as
taste
it
was
light
and
crisp
with
some
maltyness
and
some
citrus
not
very
hoppy
at
all
the
carbonation
was
not
bad
and
neither
was
the
alcohol
imo
this
is
one
of
the
easier
drinking
barleywines
around
notes
neither
deserves
the
bad
or
good
press
the
design
and
marketing
defiance
is
relatively
fun
but
as
an
import
from
the
uk
probably
comes
too
pricey
compared
to
similar
and
far
superior
local
us
offerings
if
and
when
in
the
uk
this
has
to
be
fairly
decent
right
very
light
hoppy
finish
that
combines
with
the
alcohol
to
curb
the
sweetness
a
little
bit
makes
it
easier
to
go
back
for
more
sips
on
this
big
beer
the
weight
is
apparent
but
well
worn
overall
it
is
the
first
english
barleywine
i
have
had
but
it
hasnt
stood
up
to
the
american
ones
i
have
had
not
sure
why
add
in
further
inspection
of
this
bottle
it
is
actually
11
2
and
from
2007
didnt
notice
that
before
d
drinkable
heat
isnt
so
bad
for
10
5
for
a
barleywine
this
is
seriously
lacking
in
smell
and
flavor
overall
it
is
pretty
weak
last
year
upon
recieving
a
bottle
i
decided
to
let
it
sit
for
about
a
year
and
try
it
wow
what
a
difference
particularly
in
regards
to
the
sharp
alcohol
presence
that
i
had
experienced
in
other
years
tastings
after
letting
this
product
mellow
for
a
year
i
would
put
it
almost
on
par
with
old
foghorn
or
other
high
quality
english
style
barleywines
ive
enjoyed
so
my
advice
if
you
end
up
with
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
let
it
sit
for
a
year
or
so
and
you
might
be
pleasantly
surprised
10
abv
50cl
bottle
5
99
at
luekens
seems
a
bit
expensive
light
copper
color
with
nice
tan
head
sweet
malty
smell
peppered
with
floral
like
noble
hops
sweet
refined
sugar
and
alcohol
the
first
couple
of
tastes
were
a
bit
harsh
until
my
taste
buds
had
a
chance
to
adjust
this
beer
has
a
moderately
syrupy
mouth
feel
the
alcohol
flavor
hits
up
front
but
doesnt
impede
the
flavor
all
that
much
then
some
light
pale
caramel
and
sugary
malt
sweetness
kicks
in
as
does
the
pine
and
floral
hoppy
bitterness
this
beer
definetly
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
tastes
like
a
big
brother
to
samuel
smiths
ipa
picked
this
one
up
because
it
was
on
sale
at
my
local
store
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
creamy
tan
head
that
retains
fairly
well
and
leaves
good
lacing
down
my
glass
smell
starts
out
as
malts
and
alcohol
and
slowly
turns
into
total
fruity
raisins
with
alcohol
tastes
of
malts
a
slight
bit
of
hops
and
some
alcoholapples
and
lots
of
sweets
in
here
as
well
this
taste
also
eventually
becomes
the
fruity
taste
of
a
belgian
beer
with
alcohol
seems
like
the
original
flavors
of
the
beer
fade
very
quickly
on
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
alcohol
warming
the
mouth
and
a
taste
of
raisins
is
left
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
low
because
the
beers
good
flavors
seem
to
fade
out
fast
to
straight
dark
fruits
and
raisins
alcohol
taste
gets
bad
before
the
bottle
is
finished
good
to
try
not
very
good
to
buy
again
aftertaste
of
fruits
gets
to
me
taste
became
unberable
after
the
first
few
sips
nothing
really
going
on
here
enjoyability
ends
after
a
few
sips
very
fruity
flavor
green
apples
pears
and
maybe
even
some
melon
rinds
dont
think
the
malts
support
the
high
alcohol
enough
there
is
some
earthy
hops
in
there
but
not
enough
even
for
an
english
bw
this
one
is
pretty
disappointing
especially
considering
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
bad
elf
and
very
bad
elf
maybe
too
many
elves
are
a
bad
thing
a
fine
ale
however
santas
little
helper
lacks
the
wow
factor
i
have
come
to
expect
from
barleywines
this
said
it
is
still
worth
the
wait
and
ill
finish
this
bottle
with
dinner
tonight
this
reminds
me
not
one
whit
of
the
justly
famous
and
lauded
brakespeare
bitter
i
was
fortunate
to
have
toured
the
brewery
in
a
camra
guided
bicycle
brewery
and
pub
hejira
many
moons
ago
thrilled
to
see
the
spirit
lives
on
the
taste
was
overpowered
by
the
alcohol
most
of
the
other
flavors
were
masked
by
it
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
thick
and
warming
i
definitely
would
have
liked
this
beer
better
on
a
cold
night
drinkability
was
not
great
but
of
course
these
beers
are
meant
to
be
sipped
drinkability
is
average
this
is
just
a
generic
strong
sweet
english
barleywine
i
thought
the
age
would
be
enough
to
give
it
a
far
chance
but
this
is
one
that
probably
will
never
really
get
that
good
just
fade
away
over
time
i
dont
get
any
kettle
caramelization
like
you
find
in
the
better
english
stock
ales
and
im
guessing
this
used
a
high
proportion
of
sugars
the
taste
was
at
first
quite
flavourful
and
pleasant
strong
and
alcoholic
but
good
with
burn
raisin
some
winey
fruitiness
strong
palebock
qualities
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
and
a
little
burnt
caramel
however
it
soon
degraded
a
bit
becoming
more
just
sweet
with
rough
alcohol
and
rough
bitterness
ye
never
got
bad
in
the
end
this
is
notup
to
ridgeways
best
beers
but
is
better
than
any
of
ridgeways
other
christmas
beers
in
my
book
atleast
when
aged
a
year
seems
like
its
almost
an
america
dipa
it
would
certainly
score
higher
as
such
the
color
wouldnt
be
a
problem
and
the
body
is
a
lot
closer
you
might
want
to
ramp
the
bitterness
up
a
little
for
that
but
it
is
really
close
for
a
barleywine
well
ill
pass
poured
a
orangish
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
sized
white
head
nose
is
alcohol
english
malts
hops
taste
is
boozy
and
thin
with
a
grainy
taste
and
english
maltshops
mouthfeel
is
boozy
thin
and
not
to
impressive
honestly
i
felt
this
was
below
average
in
every
category
while
not
a
terrible
ale
in
its
own
right
as
far
as
being
an
english
barleywine
this
was
certainly
not
poured
up
a
light
orangeamber
colour
with
a
two
finger
thick
white
head
that
vanished
in
about
40
seconds
this
didnt
even
look
like
any
english
barelywine
i
had
ever
seen
smell
was
a
bit
boozy
and
had
more
attributes
expected
of
any
number
of
belgian
varieties
than
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
there
was
however
a
trace
of
the
sweet
malt
aroma
so
closely
associated
with
this
style
taste
begins
in
the
mouth
pleasantly
sweet
with
some
unidentified
maltiness
which
quickly
turns
both
bitter
as
well
as
assertively
warm
from
the
booze
all
around
a
disaster
imo
this
hardly
resembles
what
the
brewers
were
clearly
going
for
i
absolutely
do
not
care
for
this
at
all
and
honestly
im
rather
disappointed
d
the
malt
flavors
are
softer
that
the
hops
which
are
already
soft
in
flavor
and
the
whole
beer
is
pretty
one
dimensional
so
many
better
beers
of
this
style
from
england
and
the
u
s
but
i
am
happy
for
having
tried
this
one
drinkability
great
if
you
can
get
by
the
alcohol
it
poured
like
a
soda
which
i
think
is
unusual
for
barley
wine
it
is
highly
carbonated
it
made
a
lot
of
head
with
a
lot
of
fizz
to
the
body
the
head
didnt
go
anywhere
it
stayed
there
the
whole
time
i
was
drinking
it
died
down
a
little
but
for
the
most
part
it
had
great
retainability
great
brown
amber
body
it
omits
a
strong
odor
of
alcohol
and
malt
there
was
not
much
for
hops
as
there
is
with
most
barley
wines
it
is
pretty
sweet
with
a
lot
of
malt
to
the
flavor
a
toffee
tone
is
the
majority
of
the
flavor
easy
mouthfeel
decent
this
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
caramel
malt
with
some
applesauce
cinnamon
yeast
and
alcohol
it
tasted
like
applesauce
and
apricots
with
honey
wheat
malt
copper
hops
and
sweet
yeast
it
was
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
had
the
biggest
and
best
flavor
of
any
ridgeway
beer
it
was
fairly
unique
and
clean
and
hid
the
alcohol
pretty
well
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
had
good
body
too
definitely
worth
drinking
although
still
not
a
superstar
i
could
imagine
more
sweet
maltiness
developing
with
age
which
could
help
this
beer
reach
a
more
critical
acclaim
pours
a
nice
clear
coppery
amber
head
is
sort
of
thick
and
does
not
stick
around
aroma
is
strong
and
more
fruity
than
hoppy
like
a
cider
flavor
is
rather
ciderish
with
a
fierce
alcohol
bite
about
what
i
expect
from
a
barleywine
there
is
a
harsh
smoky
undertone
and
a
bit
of
unpleasant
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
still
worth
a
try
if
barleywines
are
to
your
liking
ddidnt
subject
my
liver
to
the
whole
bottle
so
wouldnt
drink
again
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
and
served
in
a
snifter
this
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
hue
with
a
thick
head
of
creamy
beige
foam
that
resulted
from
an
aggressive
pour
great
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
oranges
apricot
sugary
toffee
and
a
bit
of
perfumey
alcohol
the
flavor
included
sticky
sweet
caramel
biting
dull
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
astringent
orange
a
lingering
finish
of
metallic
orange
makes
this
one
increasingly
hard
to
choke
down
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
had
light
carbonation
definately
not
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
due
to
strong
alcohol
taste
needs
to
be
sipped
decent
atmosphere
and
flavor
although
not
overly
complex
nose
is
mush
more
so
unfortunately
because
of
this
the
flavor
underwhelms
after
you
get
the
nose
overall
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
decent
quaff
dalcohol
is
very
present
but
the
taste
is
so
pleasing
and
complex
that
i
want
more
poured
a
light
brown
color
small
white
head
with
partial
lacing
has
a
very
mixed
aroma
and
flavor
has
a
very
sweet
ands
spicy
flavor
to
it
not
very
bitter
but
has
a
stong
malt
flavor
that
seems
to
stick
around
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
decent
barleywine
but
definitely
nothing
great
d
this
was
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
brews
from
ridgeway
once
again
and
not
to
sound
like
a
broken
record
but
this
was
nothing
like
what
i
look
for
in
a
barleywine
i
liked
the
beer
just
as
well
for
what
it
is
and
now
almost
feel
guilty
holding
style
guidelines
against
it
final
verdict
criminally
bad
elf
is
certainly
nothing
worthy
of
locking
up
whether
its
worthy
of
picking
up
youll
have
to
make
that
call
pours
an
orangish
copper
color
with
some
nice
initial
head
a
bit
of
lasting
head
and
a
bit
of
nice
lacing
wicked
mixed
scent
a
very
strong
malt
although
not
as
deep
as
many
barley
wines
ive
had
with
an
interesting
english
hop
aroma
odd
for
an
english
style
interesting
taste
as
well
same
as
the
scent
very
malty
but
with
a
higher
than
usual
hop
characteristic
although
the
aftertaste
is
still
a
strong
semibittersweet
malt
goes
down
fine
if
not
overly
smooth
a
nice
christmas
barley
wine
another
bust
from
ridgeway
pours
light
brown
with
red
highlights
small
white
head
with
partial
lacing
vanilla
bubblegum
caramel
and
peaches
sickeningly
sweet
spicy
flavor
with
molasses
dates
and
something
like
a
cigarette
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
a
mess
this
one
got
me
to
quit
ridgeway
permanently
d
moderately
good
drinkability
despite
its
high
abv
but
wont
necessarily
wow
you
complexity
wise
yet
on
the
whole
this
is
pretty
damn
good
a
distinct
barleywine
on
the
smoother
side
than
old
ruffian
or
bigfoot
my
favorites
by
far
this
is
in
the
vein
of
a
strong
but
smooth
ale
one
well
worth
trying
nothing
fantastic
but
still
a
good
example
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
didnt
really
crave
another
one
but
would
drink
again
d
suprizingly
good
its
not
too
crazy
on
the
mouth
just
very
sweet
color
is
a
bit
light
for
the
style
a
medium
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
is
also
a
bit
light
subtle
hops
fruity
malts
and
residual
sugars
the
taste
is
richer
and
more
complex
than
the
nose
nice
balance
between
sweet
malts
and
the
fruity
hops
medium
body
drinks
well
coming
from
the
uk
i
espected
this
to
be
a
little
more
towards
the
english
barleywine
side
than
it
is
a
nice
brew
but
way
overpriced
medium
body
with
a
smooth
creamish
feel
to
it
and
a
well
hidden
potency
that
lay
beneath
the
sweetnss
mostly
easy
drinker
for
the
size
of
this
beast
just
be
careful
its
criminal
i
will
never
purchase
this
beer
again
but
if
offered
i
may
try
it
to
see
if
the
bottle
i
purchased
was
bad
taste
starts
out
sweet
and
light
but
ends
very
dry
potent
and
bitter
a
very
light
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
this
beer
leads
to
a
promising
brew
but
finishes
fairly
disapointing
it
is
true
to
its
style
but
to
me
barleywine
is
an
acquired
taste
and
i
just
cant
come
to
terms
with
it
yet
a
bit
too
much
for
me
very
nicely
balanced
wow
crazy
well
hidden
alcohol
a
wad
of
cookie
dough
pleasing
aroma
makes
me
want
to
trounce
a
maitre
de
dark
maple
syrup
smell
one
of
those
beers
that
makes
you
wonder
if
the
abv
is
truly
what
they
say
sweet
plum
sugar
flavours
not
a
bad
effort
drinkability
a
sipper
more
due
to
abv
than
flavor
no
trouble
finishing
this
but
not
one
id
redo
d
this
is
a
good
enough
beer
which
is
worth
drinking
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
similar
barleywines
and
i
do
not
think
this
one
stands
too
far
above
the
majority
flavors
are
not
well
rounded
or
overly
complex
unless
you
find
alcohol
complex
an
okay
sipper
but
not
even
close
to
my
favorite
barleywine
maybe
it
would
have
been
best
to
let
this
sit
for
a
year
or
more
overall
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
i
wont
be
worried
about
drinking
this
one
again
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
deep
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
a
decent
lace
all
the
way
down
the
bottle
malty
aroma
with
some
earthy
hops
but
marred
by
a
significant
fusel
nose
with
notes
of
green
apple
and
some
hints
of
solvent
flavor
is
better
with
malt
up
front
some
hops
but
still
with
some
higher
alcohols
not
extreme
but
offputting
some
alcoholic
astringence
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
liked
their
other
2
christmas
beers
but
this
one
i
think
stands
out
very
well
certainly
one
to
look
out
for
next
season
d
best
at
warmer
temps
drinkable
and
somewhat
enjoyable
complex
one
of
the
best
in
the
elf
series
which
is
as
far
as
ill
recommend
it
a
pretty
decent
english
style
barley
wine
gives
a
nice
glow
about
half
way
through
the
bottle
and
pairs
well
with
stinky
cheese
like
royal
blue
stilton
this
was
a
better
offering
than
the
very
bad
elf
and
very
adequate
however
i
will
probably
stick
with
some
of
the
more
mundane
named
beverages
for
christmas
time
with
my
next
purchases
i
expected
something
more
conservative
but
it
came
in
a
touch
below
that
even
simply
the
flavor
takes
a
stab
at
good
but
hits
adequate
instead
theres
a
muscular
abv
that
never
hides
but
despite
a
flavor
challenge
it
doesnt
inhibit
too
terribly
much
so
it
could
have
more
depth
and
complexity
but
its
a
decent
fireside
companion
asis
drinks
a
bit
slow
because
of
the
intense
dryness
but
a
solid
winter
warmer
a
decent
brew
that
sufferes
from
a
little
bit
too
much
booziness
pours
a
clear
amber
with
some
head
nose
is
minimal
really
with
very
little
coming
up
except
a
slight
sweet
tone
there
might
even
be
just
a
wee
bit
of
apple
there
flavor
is
very
very
sweet
with
just
a
slightly
noticeable
alcohol
presence
i
also
feel
like
i
am
getting
a
slight
wooden
edge
to
it
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
mouthfeel
slightly
thin
with
a
slightly
thick
carbonation
on
the
tongue
this
one
masks
the
10
5
very
well
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
i
just
get
the
feeling
that
if
this
one
were
laid
down
for
a
year
or
many
more
it
would
be
even
more
well
rounded
and
even
better
drinkability
very
average
not
sure
id
drink
this
one
again
uncomplete
this
is
not
the
bitter
hop
monster
i
have
come
to
associate
with
american
barley
wines
the
flavor
is
very
light
sweet
and
fruity
but
with
intense
alcohol
lots
of
malt
and
understated
hops
alcohol
borders
on
being
harsh
cellaring
would
probably
do
wonders
to
smooth
this
one
out
overall
impression
it
could
stand
from
another
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
if
youre
holding
one
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
outstanding
either
once
again
we
revisit
the
same
tastes
of
ridgeway
this
could
be
the
most
mediocre
english
barleywine
i
have
ever
tried
it
pours
very
transparent
and
a
bit
darker
than
the
other
bad
elves
but
not
much
no
head
whatsoever
thick
and
soupy
with
extra
ridgeway
funk
gnarly
malts
and
sugar
taste
like
cheap
candy
thats
been
sitting
in
a
bowl
at
the
doctors
office
for
eight
years
the
residue
left
on
the
lips
is
kind
of
unpleasant
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
thin
for
a
barleywine
alcohol
slaps
you
in
the
face
on
the
finish
drinkability
is
similar
to
that
of
bacon
grease
drinkability
this
isnt
awful
but
it
sure
is
criminal
to
put
a
barleywine
of
this
quality
on
the
shelf
under
the
shelton
brothers
name
i
guess
this
series
is
the
craft
beer
equivalent
nutcracker
ballets
that
dance
companies
use
for
their
moneymakers
this
time
of
year
this
was
an
interesting
experience
and
was
the
first
barleywine
ive
ever
had
unfortunately
it
wasnt
anything
to
write
home
about
i
probably
need
to
try
some
other
beers
within
the
style
in
order
to
get
a
better
impression
of
what
to
expect
drinkability
well
ill
power
down
this
bomber
but
i
dont
think
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
one
again
like
i
said
ive
probably
been
ruined
for
ebws
forever
insanity
was
so
good
everything
else
will
probably
pale
in
comparison
this
im
sure
is
a
solid
ebw
its
strong
and
powerful
also
the
warmer
you
leave
it
get
the
more
the
complex
flavor
i
finding
this
out
with
most
british
ales
overall
an
overhyped
beer
with
a
cool
name
that
is
a
perfectly
fine
english
barleywine
but
has
some
balance
issues
that
dont
necesdary
add
up
to
a
great
beer
the
mineral
character
which
may
be
a
result
of
the
oxforshire
water
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
though
it
may
be
a
quality
other
prefer
pours

a
nice

need
to
try
insanely
bad
elf
next
i
guess
low
carbonation
and
creamy

crisp
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
beer
poured
from
a

bottle
into
a
pint
glass
comes
out
amber
with
a
light

thick

not
much

not
even

more
than
makes
up
for
it
spicy
sweet
with
lots
pale

kick
feels
fairly
thick
on
the
tongue
with
a
sweet

i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
of
this
one

some
real
nice

it
out
the
feel
is

sweet

slick
finishes
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
not
a
bad
brew
a
tad
slick
and
on
the
sweet
side
the
alcohol
will
keep
you
from
wanting
to
drink
more
than

spicy

not

else
flavor
is
a
yawn
big

syrupy
malts
with
an
odd
bitter
finish
this
is
like
simple
syrup
mixed
with
booze
and
weird
estersphenolswhatever
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
considering
the
sweet
and
booze
this
is
weak

d
not

could
use
some
age
to
mellow
and
balance
the
edge
the
body
is
full
and
just
a
touch
syrupy
just
right
for
an
english
barleywine
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
ive
had
in
a
long
time
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
on
both
the
swallow
and
exhale
something
about
the
high
abv
and
how
easily
its
hidden
hurts
the
drinkability
a
little
the
beer
certainly
shows
the
strength
that
you
would
expect
from
the
name
but
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
maturing
to
do
in
order
to
fall
into
balance
very
richly
malty
sweet
alcoholic
and
fruity
in
the
nose
flavors
are
maltdominant
showing
a
lot
of
barly
sweetness
estery
fruits
peaches
cherries
plumbs
and
pears
phenols
and
fusal
alcohols
these
alcohols
become
more
abrasive
as
the
beer
wears
on
finishes
with
a
huge
burst
of
sweetness
booze
and
a
little
bitter
and
salty
certainly
some
quality
ingredients
in
here
just
going
to
take
more
time
to
properly
round
out
unlike
american
barleywines
this
beer
is
more
malt
than
hops
its
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
the
beer
as
it
sets
in
the
glass
after
the
pour
from
the
500ml
bottle
appears
as
slightly
hazy
burnished
copper
with
the
head
modest
in
size
off
white
and
frothy
it
vanishes
rather
quickly
leaving
the
a
patchy
coating
of
lace
nose
is
cotton
candy
sweet
hints
of
fusel
alcohol
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
spice
pumpkin
like
is
what
im
trying
say
start
is
obnoxiously
sweet
malt
present
adequate
alcohol
bite
noticeable
top
is
medium
in
feel
finish
continues
the
heavy
sweetness
hops
overwhelmed
a
tummy
warmer
and
the
aftertaste
sticks
to
your
palate
like
the
peanut
butter
from
k
rations
but
as
im
abbynormal
i
like
this
beer
lol
d
was
it
great
not
really
but
was
it
a
balenced
enjoyable
barleywine
yes
drinkability

the
lack
of
a
big
boozy
kick
makes
this
quite
quaffable
for
a
10
abv
ale
this
brew
is
a
bright
copper
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
dissipates
steadily
minimal
lacing
is
evident
aroma
of
earthy
malt
and
pungent
fruit
as
well
as
some
citrusy
hops
mediumbodied
watery
at
times
with
malt
and
spice
flavors
along
with
touches
of
hops
and
alcohol
more
hoppy
in
the
finish
with
a
lingering
alcohol
aftertaste
as
a
barley
wine
i
feel
it
should
be
more
robust
pretty
average
on
everything
except
the
aroma
deep
tawny
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
powerfully
aromatic
with
hints
of
raisins
toffee
prunes
caramel
red
apple
not
a
complex
or
deeply
satisfying
aroma
but
it
is
powerful
flavors
are
really
dull
and
muted
its
lacking
depth
and
describable
character
nothing
like
a
typical
american
barleywine
yet
this
is
a
tasty
brew
on
a
90
degree
day
in
june
its
a
bit
much
on
a
10
degree
day
in
january
it
would
be
just
right
still
hooray
for
the
clearance
shelf
the
body
is
full
with
a
strong
sugary
feel
the
fusel
alcohol
leaves
a
hot
finish
but
good
light
carbonation
and
a
nice
balance
of
hops
leaves
a
drinkable
finish
this
might
be
a
bad
elf
but
i
would
say
its
a
good
beer
it
looks
like
i
missed
seriously
bad
elf
somewhere
along
the
way
when
i
finally
manage
to
locate
a
bottle
i
hope
its
closer
to
the
earlier
beers
in
the
series
rather
than
this
most
recent
one
whats
next

a

called

what
the

the
fact
that
this

is
anything
but
the

bollocks
id
give
it
a
go
barley
wine
that
fizzes
now
im
interested
and
a
bit
afraid
the
lack
of
carbonation
has
always
deflected
me
from
really
enjoying
barley
wines
this
could
be
trouble
the
color
is
golden
btw
the
smell
is
pears
honey
and
a
note
of
hops
nice
the
taste
is
good
but
cloyingly
sweet
the
honey
flavor
shows
up
in
spades
no
hops
within
a
mile
of
this
thing
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
shows
none
of
the
carbonation
that
the
pour
hinted
at
drinkability
sorry
just
not
my
style
and
as
hard
as
i
try
to
rate
this
within
the
style
just
cant
get
there
read
someone

interesting

beer
continues
this
year
with
this
offering
pours
to
a
perfect
honey
colored
body
with
a
light
tan
head
that
fades
from
2
inches
to
a
quarter
inch
with
some
lace
very
sweet
nose
with
notes
of
red
liqurice
toffee
malt
and
earthy
vanilla
enters
the

very
smooth
and
flat
out
delicious
slightly
sweet
with
woodsy
richness
long
mineral
tones
on
the
finish
amazingly
well
hidden
alchol
untill
it
hits
the
belly
leaves
a
thick
mouthfeel
very
enjoyable
cant
wait
to
have
another
drinkability
mediocre
at
best
to
me
a
flimsy
body
and
a
weak
flavor
doesnt
make
for
a
good
english
barleywine
medium
body
lowtomoderate
carbonation
syrupy
mouthfeel
balance
is
decent
though
the
hops
have
a
tough
time
getting
much
notice
alcohol
present
throughout
and
warming
is
evident
as
well
and
honestly
this
is
the
most
dominant
characteristic
of
the
beer
average
drinkability
as
this
is
the
type
youre
likely
to
only
have
one
of
in
a
session
criminally
bad
elf
pours
a
very
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
50
cl
bottle
aroma
has
a
little
carmel
and
a
little
fruit
it
is
kind
of
underwhelming
for
the
style
i
expect
more
strength
to
the
aroma
there
is
a
fairly
strong
carmel
flavor
and
a
hint
of
fruit
and
quite
a
bit
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
this
one
is
fairly
hot
and
might
benefit
from
a
couple
years
of
aging
im
not
sure
it
would
be
a
great
beer
then
either
but
fresh
its
only
average
at
best
i
like
the
name
more
than
the
beer
my
suggestion
for
the
next
round
would
be
lewd
and
lacivious
elf
this
beer
pours
a
classic
copper
color
with
little
to
no
apparent
head
just
a
thin
fim
of
white
bubbles
on
top
that
laces
a
bit
on
the
way
down
the
smell
is
caramel
malts
and
spicey
hops
with
a
touch
of
more
floral
hops
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
well
as
a
solvent
like
smell
come
through
also
may
be
some
fusel
alcohols
the
taste
mimics
the
smell
the
alcohol
hotness
is
very
prevelant
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
mouth
more
so
than
i
would
prefer
hop
bitterness
dominates
any
malty
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
and
a
nice
alcohol
warmness
the
drinkability
is
also
ok
as
the
abv
climbs
drinkability
is
always
going
to
suffer
a
bit
but
this
one
suffers
a
bit
more
because
alcoholic
taste
is
not
masked
well
enough
by
the
hops
and
residual
sweetness
all
in
all
for
the
uk
this
is
an
impressive
shot
at
an
extreme
beer
i
hope
to
see
morebetter
like
this
come
out
from
the
uk
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
due
to
a
pretty
severe
booze
factor
but
ionce
you
get
passed
that
it
does
taste
good
though
a
tad
plain
this
could
probably
benefit
from
some
time
in
the
cellar
to
remove
some
burn
the
last
of
the
ridgeway
brews
im
sampling
for
the
season
and
this
one
isnt
too
bad
a
nice
representation
of
an
english
style
barley
wine
i
might
revisit
this
one
although
i
am
scared
of
that
damn
elf
looking
all
menacing
behind
bars
on
the
label
however
this
is
a
fine
ale
to
drink
down
with
an
unwavering
ease
of
simplicity
thats
actually
the
best
aspect
of
the
entire
session
as
you
will
welcome
its
bigger
1pt
9
oz
bottle
with
a
one
drinkable
glass
of
good
looking
ale
and
a
mouth
full
of
feathery
hop
heat
drinkability
is
hindered
by
the
alcohol
i
remember
when
there
was
just
a
bad
elf
damn
that
seems
so
long
agothis
poured
into
a
impy
pint
glass
a
light
copperbronze
with
a
tight
but
thinner
white
head
that
didnt
have
much
lasting
power
wow
first
whiff
after
the
cap
was
popped
was
a
real
skunkiness
but
iam
quite
sure
this
wasnt
skunked
almost
rotten
fruitlike
as
it
settled
a
dark
raisiny
quality
came
thru
making
it
easier
to
take
in
pretty
thin
for
a
barley
wine
not
big
and
or
chewey
at
allsomewhat
boozy
with
flavors
of
dark
fruit
and
brown
sugar
mainly
i
did
get
a
hint
of
minty
hop
in
the
finish
uhm
this
is
one
not
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
buy
because
of
the
lagel
gimmick
or
anything
like
that
its
just
not
that
goodnext
years
elf
ill
pass
on
i
think
drinkability
not
good
for
the
style
this
beer
just
does
not
cut
it
pass
on
this
criminal
elf
gets
hotter
as
we
go
the
bite
getting
bigger
im
liking
it
more
but
its
still
not
exactly
what
i
loveh
felonious
elf
you
taste
good
but
you
dont
drive
me
crazy
i
like
you
a
little
despite
having
been
pretty
underwhelmed
with
past
experiences
with
this
line
of
beers
which
seem
to
get
as
much
mileage
out
of
the
seasonal
label
as
the
beer
itself
i
decided
to
give
this
one
a
try
while
not
a
standout
it
was
a
rather
nice
beer
with
sturdy
caramelsweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
dried
fruit
in
the
background
lacked
much
depth
beyond
that
and
didnt
do
much
to
hold
my
interest
pleasant
enough
not
a
horrible
beer
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
try
again
does
get
the
job
done
the
suds
are
busy
and
leave
remnants
throughout
the
drinking
experience
otherwise
it
looks
like
a
standard
ale
in
this
style
there
is
very
little
complexity
to
the
nose
it
is
however
extremely
sweet
smelling
underneath
which
is
a
grainey
aroma
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
dry
heavy
in
barley
character
but
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
it
smells
the
balance
of
elements
in
the
profile
is
commendable
even
without
inspiring
any
words
on
the
hops
it
turns
out
to
be
a
very
approachable
barley
wine
not
wimpy
not
overpowering
the
length
is
also
commendable
and
it
isnt
syrupy
or
sticky
like
so
many
barley
wines
are
there
is
clean
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
the
10
5
abv
is
well
blended
into
the
profile
making
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
is
a
classy
barley
wine
forget
the
hype
id
probably
drink
this
again
but
not
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
true
barleywine
its
got
a
nice
thing
going
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
if
you
never
tried
a
barleywine
ale
before
i
would
not
start
with
this
one
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
at
least
i
got
a
cool
bottle
for
my
collection
a
bit
hot
even
regardless
of
the
style
as
its
harsh
and
spicey
not
much
in
the
way
of
depth
or
character
to
sum
it
up
this
is
a
high
alcohol
bomb
and
dont
expect
a
whole
lot
more
what
an
odd
english
barleywine
it
sort
of
starts
like
a
mild
english
barleywine
but
ends
super
american
dipa
english
craft
beer
drinkability
a
moderately
drinkable
beer
probably
needs
to
age
a
little
more
it
would
probably
go
better
with
some
food
to
help
balance
flavors
50
cl
bottle
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
plan
to
revisit
especially
considering
the
price
tag
the
beer
came
in
a
light
brown
bottle
that
proudly
exhibited
the
bad
elf
behind
bars
the
generous
50
cl
size
and
the
10
5
abv
meant
a
serious
session
ahead
for
this
solo
drinker
as
i
cracked
it
open
and
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
the
clarity
of
the
pale
amber
body
surprised
me
the
beer
also
looked
thinner
and
more
fluid
than
a
typical
barleywine
the
aroma
although
mild
was
distinctive
with
a
balance
between
spicy
hops
and
orange
marmalade
like
malt
sweetness
the
taste
was
well
crafted
with
neither
of
the
bitter
spicy
and
sweet
flavors
dominating
the
others
the
finish
was
dry
and
dusty
and
the
alcohol
was
notably
absent
throughout
the
only
fault
i
could
find
is
the
lack
of
richness
in
the
thin
body
but
considering
the
drinkability
of
the
concoction
this
was
but
a
minor
quibble
overall
im
not
disappointed
that
i
bought
it
but
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
it
again
overall
listed
as
a
barleywine
my
initial
reaction
was
how
well
pale
it
looked
given
its
high
strength
and
the
taxation
sliding
scale
in
the
uk
this
one
is
not
cheap
and
could
be
considered
rather
expensive
despite
the
high
end
pricing
the
beer
is
rather
ordinary
average
to
be
honest
joe
average
typical
middle
of
the
road
standard
runofthemill
stock
neither
here
nor
there
soso
arghh
ok
yeah
its
just
a
35
criminally
expensive
for
what
it
is
very
drinkable
and
by
no
means
bad
but
in
the
realm
of
barley
wines
this
one
falls
short
of
the
majesty
and
multifaceted
nature
of
so
many
of
my
favorites
a
50cl
bottle
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
nevertheless
leaves
some
decent
lacing
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
with
some
hints
of
bread
i
thought
the
taste
was
somewhat
underassuming
some
alcohol
a
little
hops
not
much
else
there
thin
and
mild
in
the
mouth
at
10abv
this
is
a
beer
to
sip
50
cl
bottle
this
beer
fills
my
glass
with
a
true
amber
colored
liquid
bubbling
with
very
tiny
and
fine
bits
of
carbonation
there
is
only
a
small
head
that
forms
but
falls
very
fast
to
less
than
a
coating
over
top
clarity
on
the
initial
pour
is
very
good
an
inspection
of
the
aroma
finds
a
lot
of
sweet
caramel
overlaid
by
a
very
nice
sweet
raisin
a
swirl
of
the
glass
elicits
some
toasty
british
malts
that
provide
a
nice
bit
of
balance
to
the
sweetness
flavors
that
i
find
first
are
strong
toasted
malt
infused
with
alcohol
spiceyness
with
a
chunky
caramel
sweetness
and
a
nice
fruity
raisin
the
aftertaste
has
a
small
earthy
hop
and
bitterness
along
with
the
really
nice
toastyness
from
the
malt
the
alcohol
flavor
is
a
little
strong
to
me
but
it
is
not
harsh
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
some
slickness
and
a
mild
carbonation
the
slickness
stays
on
my
tongue
for
a
while
as
well
drinkability
on
this
one
is
okay
it
is
a
little
hot
in
my
stomach
and
giving
me
a
little
acid
feeling
in
my
esophagus
i
think
the
toasty
flavors
really
make
this
one
work
and
keep
it
from
being
cloying
and
overly
harsh
in
the
alcohol
i
think
it
is
worth
a
look
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
a
very
nice
english
barleywine
but
i
think
that
this
could
use
some
additional
maturation
i
suspect
that
a
year
in
the
cellar
would
make
this
even
better
its
a
little
too
sweet
but
otherwise
its
a
nice
slowsipping
brew

o
ive
had
my
fair
share
of

while
this
wasnt
terrible
for
the
style
it
could
be
doing
a

better
ive
had
beers
aged
5x

that
have
held
up
much
better
while
it
was
definitely
worth

5
to
try

not
something
ill
be
going
back
to
try
anytime
soon
2012
edition
big
beer
and
probably
not
the
best
choice
on
the
first
real
hot
morning
of
summer
but
whatever
it
was
next
in
line
this
beer
is
dark
amber
in
color
like
good
maple
syrup
and
happens
to
both
look
and
taste
a
lot
like
molasses
some
yeast
particles
and
still
showing
a
nice
rich
cream
head
aromas
of
burnt
sugar
and
slightly
stale
caramel
malt
plenty
of
sugar
and
plenty
of
booze
almost
has
an
oak
aged
mellowness
to
it
and
the
alcohol
never
really
shows
up
which
is
possibly
a
product
of
its
age
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
in
taste
lost
in
the
zone
between
english
and
american
styles
with
a
strange
and
out
of
place
hop
profile
too
which
was
likely
more
intense
when
this
was
fresh
baking
spices
in
the
finish
very
autumnal
we
probably
should
have
saved
this
one
until
fall
big
body
that
just
gets
impassable
as
it
warms
up
cloying
sweetness
and
an
interesting
high
gravity
ale
yeast
it
didnt
really
hold
up
super
well
though
as
the
grains
are
a
bit
skunked
out
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
the
crown
jewel
of
the
cellar
by
any
measure
either
i
am
a
fan
i
need
to
get
some
more
and
start
the
aging
process
taste
is
similar
with
more
dried
dark
fruit
and
sweet
malty
notes
and
the
hops
have
been
muted
relaxed
and
tempered
with
age
even
the
alcohol
content
is
slightly
subdued
enjoyable
overall
the
aroma
is
quite
a
bit
better
than
the
taste
o
i
have
had
this
on
tap
at
macs
before
at
a
band
gig
and
was
quite
impressed
this
does
not
disappoint
would
like
to
pick
up
another
to
hold
for
the
winter
holidays
as
this
would
be
a
great
winter
warmer
overrall
honestly
i
dont
see
the
knock
on
this
beer
i
feel
like
this
is
one
of
heavy
seas
best
brews
delivering
incredible
flavor
and
a
huge
punch
too
bad
this
is
a
seasonal
i
picked
this
up
a
few
months
ago
and
honestly
would
love
to
have
it
again
grab
a
glas
and
drink
up
salud
a
thick
and
rich
fullmedium
body
isnt
too
filling
but
offers
the
support
needed
for
a
big
brew
its
got
enough
crispness
to
be
lively
without
biting
too
hard
for
a
maltheavy
beer
and
enough
smoothness
to
make
for
good
drinking
taste
is
sweet
biscuit
malt
with
lots
of
sweet
dried
fruit
caramel
and
molasses
with
a
hint
of
tobacco
bitterness
this
is
very
very
sweet
but
still
pleasant
and
the
assuming
noble
hops
really
balance
the
sweetness
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
without
an
overpowering
hop
flavor
or
aroma
its
a
big
beer
for
sure
and
just
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
on
this
chilly
rainy
day
o
aside
from
the
aroma
this
one
is
average
i
cant
complain
about
it
being
overly
sweet
as
its
a
pure
dessert
beer
i
can
complain
about
its
lack
of
depth
and
middling
feel
though
in
addendum
the
one
i
drank
this
with
really
enjoyed
it
then
again
he
isnt
a
fan
of
barleywines
take
that
however
you
like
o
pretty
good
barleywine
nothing
spectacular
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
as
much
if
not
more
than
the
variants
o
for
a
6
bomber
of
a
very
traditional
english
bw
this
is
pretty
solid
stuff
its
also
held
up
very
well
to
two
years
of
age
unlike
their
stout
2012
vintage
interesting
beer
i
have
on
my
hands
here
the
nose
is
nothing
to
point
a
stick
at
very
normal
malty
with
some
hops
you
would
think
you
were
sniffing
alaskan
amber
at
first
surprisingly
the
nose
on
this
beer
doesnt
grow
after
it
warms
it
still
smells
malty
and
grainy
taste
is
much
different
sweet
vanilla
and
bourbon
lovely
oak
flavors
this
beer
tastes
delicious
just
really
lacks
in
the
nose
overall
not
much
complexity
to
this
one
it
has
depth
but
only
when
youre
searching
for
it
no
puns
with
the
sea
theme
just
not
a
great
beer
a
tasty
beer
at
best
this
is
somewhat
disappointing
compared
to
the
two
barrel
aged
versions
this
one
is
very
malty
which
i
loved
but
the
bready
malts
dominate
and
the
caramel
adds
more
to
the
sticky
mouthfeel
than
it
does
to
the
flavor
the
dark
fruit
notes
are
there
but
theyre
subtle
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
think
their
are
better
versions
of
it

it

hell
it
should
be
the

this
is
a
very
well
concieved
brew
grab
some
if
you
get
a
chance
on
cask
if
you
can
find
it
take
some
time
with
this
one
savor
it
drink
i
think
this
one
needs
a
bit
of
time
i
am
anxious
to
try
the
2007
i
have
at
home
now
this
was
2
of
the
day
behind
the
bourbon
and
in
front
of
the
cabernet
o
a
really
enjoyable
barley
wine
that
is
balanced
yet
potent
definitely
carries
the
monicker
well
of
the
english
rendition
as
opposed
to
the
dried
up
and
occasionally
hoppy
taste
of
bws
from
the
northwest
us
find
a
cold
night
and
a
warm
fireplace
to
enjoy
the
warming
and
sweet
goodness
or
find
a
stormy
lake
a
pewter
stein
and
get
wrecked
below
decks
with
the
crew
o
a
pretty
good
english
barleywine
sure
to
take
the
chill
of
on
a
damp
december
evening
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
but
it
still
ends
up
being
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
however
its
well
with
in
style
great
aged
brew
overall
this
was
a
pretty
solid
englishstyle
barleywine
not
up
to
the
top
class
examples
of
english
or
american
styles
there
is
nothing
inherently
wrong
or
bad
with
it
it
just
lacks
a
pop
to
make
is
special
or
something
i
want
to
revisit
again
and
again
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
anytime
soon
definitely
some
bonus
points
for
the
low
price
tag
and
abundant
availability
o
decent
barley
wine
drinkable
but
not
amazing
nothing
id
seek
out
again
odinteresting
take
on
this
beer
very
rich
and
full
bodied
i
only
had
this
as
a
part
of
a
beer
flight
and
the
small
glass
was
more
than
enough
too
syrupy
and
boozy
to
warrant
more
than
a
small
glass
in
my
opinion
i
remember
liking
the
2009
2010
bottles
a
bit
more
dark
fruit
bowl
flavors
stay
present
through
out
and
some
tasting
notes
of
an
oak
aged
beer
oddly
enough
certainly
vanilla
as
well
as
oak
or
something
like
it
detectable
booziness
plays
with
the
other
flavors
to
give
off
an
imitation
bourbon
like
note
underneath
it
all
lots
of
jammy
dark
fruits
well
concentrated
flavors
that
kind
of
present
themselves
all
together
they
all
kind
of
work
together
too
the
booziness
hurts
the
beer
a
little
as
well
as
the
fruitiness
as
its
a
big
too
fruity
and
can
be
cloying
at
times
not
bad
though
and
good
value
for
the
price
appearance
is
a
murky
orange
short
light
brown
head
the
nose
has
dark
fruit
bread
malts
some
caramel
below
decks
has
a
taste
of
raisins
malts
caramel
and
salt
the
mouthfeel
leans
towards
full
with
a
rather
dry
finish
a
pretty
good
barleywine
but
nothing
special
imho
o
this
was
pretty
average
overall
just
nothing
special
price
was
5
for
the
bottle
so
id
say
pick
it
up
and
try
it
for
yourself
dont
expect
much
more
than
what
you
pay
for
o
this
beer
is
very
good
and
i
hope
to
get
more
of
this
the
flavors
and
ingredients
come
through
each
savoring
taste
without
being
overpowering
if
this
beer
is
purchased
as
recently
bottled
it
would
a
good
idea
to
let
it
age
as
this
bottle
is
close
to
2
years
old
o
not
a
beer
you
are
going
to
break
out
on
a
special
occasion
but
not
bad
for
after
a
long
day
when
you
want
to
relax
off
tap
at
hop
heads
this
beer
was
a
ruddy
copper
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
the
retention
was
not
very
good
and
it
left
scant
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
blend
of
caramel
malt
figs
a
little
honey
and
general
sweet
malt
the
flavors
were
rather
blasé
for
a
big
beer
the
caramel
and
sweet
malts
were
present
along
with
a
touch
of
wood
and
some
balancing
citrus
and
herbal
hops
very
middleoftheroad
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
slick
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
light
o
although
a
fairly
decent
barleywine
clipper
city
did
nothing
special
this
is
textbook
and
good
but
not
outstanding
i
got
one
more
vintage
hopefully
that
one
will
be
better
where
is
that
malt
back
bone
i
guess
it
didnt
survive
the
time
drinkability
this
was
a
rare
treat
as
ebas
are
very
difficult
to
come
by
i
enjoyed
it
as
is
but
exactly
like
it
says
on
the
clipper
city
website
although
approachable
upon
release
this
one
will
benefit
from
aging
a
year
in
the
cellar
would
sweeten
this
up
just
a
tad
its
borderline
undersweetened
for
the
style
and
open
up
the
malts
a
bit
more
i
would
drink
this
again
and
again
if
in
my
area
looking
forward
to
the
bba
and
cab
versions
o
considering
the
strength
of
this
beer
it
goes
down
very
easily
o
i
have
a
feeling
the
hops
used
to
be
much
bigger
in
the
one
but
the
age
has
mellowed
them
dramatically
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
fresh
it
poured
almost
a
cola
color
with
a
head
that
dissipated
quickly
to
a
ring
and
some
lacing
the
nose
had
a
nice
malt
and
toffee
smell
but
i
also
caught
hints
of
the
ethanol
the
taste
was
pure
englishstyle
barley
wine
with
no
hops
and
lots
of
caramel
honey
and
hint
of
chocolate
in
my
opinion
it
had
a
pretty
heavy
mouthfeel
with
very
subdued
carbonation
it
was
almost
syrupy
compared
to
the
full
sail
boardhead
sampled
immediately
before
a
nice
aged
barleywine
i
will
be
sure
to
add
some
notes
from
a
fresher
bottle
but
this
one
held
up
nicely
and
i
have
a
nice
feel
for
the
beer
pours
with
almost
no
head
dark
red
color
smells
like
sugar
light
dark
fruit
smell
as
well
tastes
extremely
watered
down
its
like
a
barleywine
was
made
and
then
5
gallons
of
water
got
added
to
it
resembles
a
barleywine
though
slight
dark
fruit
and
fig
flavor
sweet
and
sugary
mouthfeel
is
very
very
light
and
watery
not
the
creamy
sticky
feeling
im
used
to
from
barleywines
overly
carbonated
not
because
it
is
actually
overly
carbonated
but
because
the
carbonation
is
overpowering
to
the
mouthfeel
and
the
overall
flavors
of
the
beer
overall
flavors
arent
very
good
and
theres
no
balance
kind
of
a
mess
this
is
a
solid
example
of
an
english
barleywine
but
probably
a
little
to
cloyingly
sweet
with
less
complexity
than
i
would
expect
still
it
is
a
decent
fare
despite
that
criticism
and
wellworth
the
effort
to
find
and
sip
especially
if
you
prefer
say
ice
wines
to
red
wines
this
would
be
a
good
choice
indeed
it
would
make
an
excellent
dessert
beer
o
for
me
it
was
a
little
above
average
didnt
really
enjoy
the
extreme
alcohol
in
the
beer
could
use
some
more
hop
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
still
pretty
good
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
it
may
not
be
the
absolute
best
ebw
that
ive
had
but
its
still
a
solid
beer
o
overall
this
is
an
above
average
barleywine
little
bit
of
heat
in
the
taste
but
could
be
even
better
with
more
time
on
it
have
bottles
of
the
bourbon
and
cabernet
versions
think
ill
sit
on
them
a
bit
longer
and
interested
to
see
how
they
are
still
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
very
good
barleywine
i
was
scarred
by
my
first
encounter
with
clipper
city
now
have
had
backtoback
positive
experiences
glad
to
have
recd
this
as
an
extra
to
further
dispel
my
youthful
doubts
about
this
brewery
right
of
the
bat
i
thought
this
barley
wine
appeared
a
little
thin
a
little
light
to
my
nose
the
heavy
barley
and
fruit
nose
werent
as
pronounced
and
at
ten
percent
i
expected
my
nose
to
sense
the
the
alcohol
beneath
it
as
far
as
taste
goes
its
not
that
i
didnt
like
the
flavor
it
just
wasnt
what
i
hope
for
in
a
barley
wine
i
want
my
pallet
to
be
full
it
doesnt
need
to
be
excessive
but
the
flavor
should
be
strong
and
bold
i
found
this
barley
wine
balanced
and
quaffable
for
a
bw
i
want
bold
and
reprehensible
in
strenth
and
stature
i
taste
the
fruit
but
i
want
it
to
hit
me
in
the
face
and
i
want
to
almost
have
to
chew
the
barley
taste
not
as
heavy
in
the
mouth
as
i
would
like
i
will
drink
it
but
there
are
others
if
available
by
belly
would
put
first
a
little
less
than
a
full
finger
of
light
tan
foam
smaller
bubbles
on
the
whole
lacing
forms
broad
sheets
yet
with
little
stickiness
clean
liquid
if
as
much
dark
brown
as
any
red
or
orange
amber
multiple
beads
of
strong
tiny
bubbles
the
nose
is
sweet
even
for
the
category
molasses
caramel
maple
syrup
butterscotch
milk
chocolate
spiced
orange
reduction
its
boozy
but
not
overpoweringly
so
peach
apricot
and
pear
close
to
a
dried
fruit
character
the
barley
oats
and
sweeter
grains
almost
an
afterthought
fullbodied
all
credit
to
the
carbonation
for
trying
but
not
quite
tough
enough
to
take
the
chunkiness
out
of
the
whole
has
a
leaden
feel
still
no
lack
of
cocoa
chocolate
caramel
toffee
and
maple
with
a
fruitcake
to
challah
bread
element
as
well
here
a
light
hoppy
bitterness
comes
through
a
welcome
addition
brings
sour
orange
with
some
lemon
the
spiciness
is
there
but
without
clearly
distinct
flavors
wears
you
down
by
the
end
of
the
glass
split
a
bottle
with
a
friend
last
week
is
supprisingly
smooth
we
split
it
while
having
sushi
it
poured
dark
brown
with
little
foam
taste
was
smokey
bitter
sweet
it
reminded
me
of
wood
in
the
finish
it
was
pretty
good
at
hiding
alcohol
burn
for
a
high
octane
beer
it
was
very
sudsy
it
was
fairly
good
drinkability
id
recomend
it
if
you
want
something
darker
this
beer
will
get
heavy
rotation
at
my
house
pretty
tasty
and
flavorful
im
in
the
unfortunate
situation
of
having
had
the
bourbon
barrel
version
of
the
tap
before
trying
this
so
its
not
as
good
as
that
but
its
pretty
good
good
sipper
not
sure
how
to
categorize
its
drinkability
it
is
pretty
enjoyable
as
a
sipper
would
be
hard
to
want
more
than
one
in
the
same
night
i
would
tend
to
want
this
beer
at
this
age
in
small
doses
with
no
comparison
to
more
recent
vintages
its
hard
to
say
if
it
improves
with
age
still
a
pretty
nice
brew
a
quite
sweet
barleywine
bordering
on
cloying
not
bad
but
pretty
onenoted
1300
d
quite
drinkable
but
not
particularly
memorable
the
aroma
is
dusty
with
caramel
malt
hops
and
a
strange
off
element
the
appearance
is
brown
with
a
large
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
the
beer
is
overall
not
bad
but
there
are
problems
with
it
that
make
it
hard
to
drink
at
times
i
am
not
really
a
fan
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
big
but
not
overbearing
there
is
not
too
much
to
this
beer
where
is
claims
control
and
tosses
you
aside
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
a
beer
with
this
high
and
abv
and
was
pretty
smooth
going
down
drinkability
very
nice
an
easy
sipper
got
2
of
these
lets
see
what
some
time
does
to
this
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
rather
mild
some
sweetness
taste
is
good
malts
dark
fruits
some
alcohol
and
a
touch
sweet
good
complexity
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
a
fine
quality
brew
drinkability
enjoyable
great
for
after
dinner
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
malty
with
a
tasty
woody
overtone
and
a
bit
of
spice
it
pours
a
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
flavor
is
woody
and
a
little
malty
with
quite
the
alcohol
bite
texture
is
fairly
smooth
but
has
a
good
alcohol
nip
which
should
be
fine
for
a
barleywine
definitely
for
barleywine
nuts
i
hope
they
give
it
a
good
high
rating
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
minimal
offwhite
head
yet
leaves
behind
generous
amounts
of
lacing
as
far
as
taste
and
aroma
i
can
only
compare
this
to
soy
sauce
smelled
of
salty
burnt
toffee
taste
was
overtly
salty
i
really
dont
have
much
good
to
say
about
this
one
not
at
all
barleywineesque
i
dont
want
to
degrade
the
brewery
as
ive
had
many
other
good
beers
from
clipper
city
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
poured
a
slow
to
emerge
2
head
which
slowly
dissipated
to
18
very
dark
and
clear
kind
of
like
a
cola
and
with
lots
of
slow
tiny
bubble
action
characteristic
of
a
thick
barleywine
yet
this
sample
is
lighter
in
body
than
others
i
tried
smells
of
barley
and
malt
and
has
some
caramel
burnt
sugar
and
sourdough
tastes
goes
down
easy
and
i
had
a
lot
of
fun
with
it
id
made
a
note
to
myself
that
it
feels
like
a
b
but
tastes
like
an
a
so
im
shooting
for
a
happy
median
of
a
b
d
pretty
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
i
just
dont
think
it
would
be
worth
going
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
another
one
d
even
though
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
it
is
still
a
sipper
it
is
a
filling
and
substantial
beer
one
of
the
earthiest
beers
i
have
tasted
d
slight
burn
from
boozy
high
alcohol
a
bit
too
sweet
delicious
but
rich
a
definite
sipper
im
normally
a
hoppy
beer
guy
and
this
is
one
barley
wine
i
can
see
me
stealing
again
first
barelywine
had
an
awesome
server
steve
who
brought
out
multiple
samples
tried
this
one
and
had
to
get
it
especially
since
it
was
on
cask
it
was
very
nice
indeed
had
a
lot
of
similarities
to
the
belgian
quads
that
ive
been
feeling
lately
plus
being
on
cask
it
wasnt
served
ice
cold
which
let
all
the
complexities
of
the
beer
come
through
without
numbing
your
tastebuds
paired
with
a
beer
brat
this
brew
was
delicious
poured
into
a
snifter
color
is
moderate
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
that
remains
for
a
bit
nose
brings
a
good
dose
of
sweet
malt
along
with
some
light
fruits
and
caramel
the
taste
is
a
bit
too
sweet
without
enough
accompanying
fruit
presence
feel
is
a
bit
cloying
drinks
well
enough
overall
but
is
just
too
sweet
drinkability
the
abv
is
hidden
decently
enough
in
the
taste
but
this
was
a
night
with
three
beers
at
least
as
strong
as
this
one
and
even
just
this
pint
left
me
buzzin
got
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
towards
the
end
but
nothing
a
had
a
problem
with
m
thick
and
rich
vintage
2008
served
from
bottle
into
a
lucifer
snifter
poured
a
hazy
deep
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
hue
with
an
offwhite
head
that
was
only
present
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
alcohol
sour
note
nutty
and
a
subtle
hop
aspect
the
flavor
was
comprised
of
malt
a
nutty
note
and
subtle
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
i
was
glad
this
one
tasted
much
better
than
it
smelled
the
flavors
were
really
nice
and
had
the
right
intensity
while
the
alcohol
could
be
tasted
it
was
not
at
all
overwhelming
very
nice
barleywine
looking
forward
to
trying
the
ba
versions
in
the
future
for
comparison
d
nice
could
be
a
bit
smoother
and
the
grapejuice
taste
can
get
irritating
when
youre
looking
for
a
beer
d
not
bad
for
a
barleywine
also
not
good
for
a
10
abv
beer
this
one
didnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
so
i
doubt
ill
be
buying
it
again
id
say
its
probably
worth
a
try
though
if
youre
a
fan
of
barleywines
clear
scarlet
tinted
amber
with
a
finger
of
fluffy
nougat
colored
foam
that
melts
slowly
and
leaves
some
craggy
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
rich
and
inviting
hot
buttered
rum
black
strap
molasses
and
minty
hops
sweet
and
sticky
malt
flavors
with
an
herbal
tobacco
leaf
hop
flavor
in
the
warmingly
alcoholic
finish
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
this
beer
isnt
for
everyone
the
alcohol
is
hot
and
in
your
face
and
is
certainly
on
the
hoppier
end
of
the
spectrum
i
dig
it
poured
a
2009
bottle
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
it
poured
very
smoothly
with
almost
no
head
the
head
that
did
exist
laced
the
glass
and
continued
dissipating
it
smelled
sweet
and
overly
boozy
the
alcohol
definitely
took
over
the
taste
was
average
very
sweet
and
very
alcohol
laden
their
was
almost
a
metallic
tint
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
though
it
was
very
very
smooth
the
carbonation
had
almost
disappeared
in
just
eight
or
so
months
i
dont
find
this
one
very
drinkable
right
now
ive
had
it
fresher
and
it
was
a
little
better
the
bourbon
barrel
version
is
the
way
to
go
between
the
complex
lush
character
and
the
lush
mouthfeel
and
palate
that
lean
towards
drinkable
this
is
no
doubt
a
beer
to
seek
out
overall
it
was
a
good
bang
for
your
buck
coming
in
at
10
abv
but
in
the
line
of
taste
it
was
lacking
something
special
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
there
is
no
date
on
the
bottle
but
i
believe
this
is
from
the
winter
of
20092010
it
has
a
tawny
redbrown
color
that
is
very
pretty
it
looks
a
lot
like
port
the
head
is
a
thin
layer
of
tan
foam
that
has
settled
quickly
to
a
skim
as
a
swirl
the
glass
around
a
good
coat
is
left
behind
the
beer
is
translucent
and
i
can
make
out
a
healthy
amount
of
carbonation
rising
within
the
aroma
also
reminds
of
a
glass
of
port
there
is
warming
quality
it
smells
alcoholic
but
also
of
plums
raisins
and
oak
the
beer
has
a
strong
english
malt
flavor
it
is
slightly
bready
but
also
full
of
toffee
plum
and
caramel
of
course
there
is
also
a
lot
of
alcohol
the
sweet
coat
that
is
left
behind
burns
off
of
my
mouth
like
the
residue
rubbing
alcohol
leaves
behind
it
turns
into
a
detectable
vapor
that
is
strong
but
not
offputting
it
doesnt
have
as
heavy
of
a
body
as
i
expected
in
fact
it
is
slightly
watery
this
surprising
lightness
is
tempered
by
the
strong
alcohol
burn
i
like
this
sensation
but
i
can
see
if
affecting
the
drinkabilty
of
this
beer
for
many
consumers
im
glad
i
have
a
couple
bottles
still
left
in
my
cellar
i
will
left
them
sit
for
a
while
before
opening
them
this
beer
is
pretty
enjoyable
now
but
i
think
some
age
will
really
improve
it
d
another
excellent
offering
from
clipper
city
this
one
was
great
to
sip
this
barleywine
is
a
sipper
and
becomes
more
complex
as
it
warms
i
really
dig
barleywines
but
i
think
this
one
is
a
tad
too
sweet
overall
or
is
it
that
i
havent
had
this
style
of
beer
in
a
long
time
taste
was
excellent
with
lingering
dry
fruit
possibly
black
currants
on
the
tongue
nice
smooth
texture
very
drinkable
hides
the
big
alcohol
in
a
complex
taste
skål
pours
a
clear
mahogany
color
with
less
than
a
one
finger
head
that
leaves
quickly
and
leaves
some
lacing
the
smell
is
strong
of
grapes
and
raisons
with
a
big
malty
note
and
some
alcohol
the
amount
of
malt
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
dopplebock
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
the
exception
that
i
picked
up
much
more
on
the
malt
and
less
on
the
cherry
there
was
a
clear
booze
bite
as
its
going
down
but
not
overpowering
there
is
a
hop
bitterness
but
not
nearly
as
strong
as
many
other
traditional
barleywines
that
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
causing
it
to
be
a
very
drinkable
brew
a
good
beer
from
a
good
brewery
drinkability
while
i
was
able
to
finish
this
one
it
didnt
take
me
even
the
first
half
of
the
beer
to
decide
i
was
not
interested
in
a
second
this
evening
and
not
because
of
the
abv
ill
have
another
bottle
fairly
soon
and
revisit
this
review
then
ill
cellar
a
couple
for
next
year
to
see
what
i
think
then
im
hoping
it
will
improve
with
some
bottle
age
but
im
not
expecting
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
there
are
several
other
english
style
barleywines
more
readily
available
d
an
average
at
best
english
barleywine
there
are
some
redeeming
qualities
in
this
heavy
seas
offering
but
they
are
not
enough
to
overcome
the
solventy
finish
on
the
palette
and
the
much
less
than
stellar
mouthfeel
its
not
a
drainpour
by
any
stretch
but
there
are
much
much
better
english
barleywines
out
there
for
a
barleywine
it
is
surprisingly
of
light
body
with
a
grassy
mouthfeel
hard
to
really
define
as
belonging
to
this
style
since
it
is
sweet
and
light
enough
to
pass
for
something
else
great
brewery
okay
beer
i
seem
to
recall
not
caring
for
this
beer
when
i
first
tried
it
a
year
or
so
ago
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
improved
with
age
still
even
in
the
face
of
lessthanstellar
qualities
this
beer
somehow
manages
to
save
itself
from
utter
disappointment
it
becomes
more
tolerable
as
it
warms
though
this
could
result
from
being
several
ounces
in
on
a
10
abv
beer
i
dont
imagine
ill
be
returning
to
this
one
id
say
a
3
5
s

d

im
a
big
fan
of
barley
wines
and
while
below
decks
doesnt
fair
well
against
the
great
american
barley
wines
it
is
one
of
the
better
english
ones
i
have
sampled
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
this
one
is
surpringly
drinkable
for
the
style
i
was
pretty
pumped
walking
in
to
this
new
beer
bar
in
dc
on
14th
street
and
they
had
this
barleywine
on
cask
there
was
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
pumped
out
along
with
a
nice
malty
dark
base
the
smell
was
roasty
toasty
chocolaty
aroma
and
the
taste
to
boot
i
really
liked
this
barleywines
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
although
take
care
with
this
ones
10
abv
theres
a
slight
hoppy
finish
as
you
put
down
the
snifter
and
enjoy
the
complex
flavors
d
okay
this
is
where
this
beer
shines
i
could
sell
this
beer
to
someone
who
thinks
michelob
amber
bock
is
a
real
beer
you
take
a
drink
and
think
not
great
but
pretty
darn
good
then
you
drink
a
couple
more
and
fall
off
the
barstool
the
10
alcohol
in
this
beer
must
have
been
encrypted
by
interpol
all
in
all
this
is
not
a
great
brew
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
english
barleywine
not
a
good
example
at
all
id
say
avoid
this
one
all
around
it
does
not
offer
much
drinkability
again
this
is
a
hohum
barleywine
its
got
the
alcohol
but
nothing
else
about
it
is
big
its
an
ok
smelling
ok
tasting
beer
with
little
complexity
or
character
clipper
city
in
general
is
hit
or
miss
but
this
is
somewhere
in
between
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
even
close
to
a
good
barleywine
on
the
upside
its
affordable
and
available
at
my
grocery
store
ill
cellar
the
last
of
my
fourpack
but
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
again
ahh
let
it
snow
a
rich
sweet
beer
heavy
body
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
interestingly
the
alcohol
is
muted
perhaps
due
to
the
extreme
nature
of
the
sugar
this
finishes
like
a
port
drinkability
ok
try
this
beer
its
a
great
example
of
a
barleywine
style
ale
some
older
vintages
are
still
available
if
you
ask
your
local
beer
shop
they
may
be
able
to
dig
some
up
for
you
great
way
to
see
what
a
little
age
can
do
for
a
great
brew
without
having
to
age
it
yourself
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
will
hold
me
to
1
per
night
pours
a
clear
copper
color
underneath
a
thin
lacy
head
a
grainy
malt
aroma
with
dark
fruit
esters
flow
up
out
from
the
brew
the
drink
is
very
caramely
with
fruit
esters
predominately
prune
flavors
there
is
good
balance
but
no
hop
presence
and
the
drink
is
surprisingly
viscous
for
the
body
which
is
only
moderately
heavy
but
the
low
levels
of
carbonation
allow
it
to
flow
much
slower
and
fuller
the
finish
is
sweet
and
malty
and
fades
relatively
quickly
with
a
subtle
warming
at
the
end
d
more
drinkable
than
i
thought
given
the
abv
this
is
my
first
barleywine
and
im
looking
forward
to
exploring
this
style
more
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
for
10
but
still
not
something
i
can
drink
that
much
of
this
was
ok
to
drink
one
of
but
nothing
fantastic
i
would
seek
out
again
good
but
a
bit
thinner
than
i
want
in
a
barley
wine
i
dont
see
this
improving
with
more
age
single
from
tw
newport
news
not
very
drinkable
would
not
recomend
this
style
by
heavy
sea
extremely
drinkable
i
have
never
been
the
biggest
fan
of
the
heavy
seas
line
but
this
one
was
enjoyable
and
my
favorite
thus
far
while
i
have
not
had
this
fresh
with
at
least
a
year
on
it
is
drinking
well
12
ounce
bottle
from
2008
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
copperorange
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
lacing
is
average
aroma
is
sweet
malt
grain
caramel
apples
and
also
a
bit
of
an
unpleasant
aroma
that
i
cant
identify
also
the
aroma
is
light
it
tastes
like
grain
figs
bread
caramel
and
booze
theres
also
a
slight
bitter
finish
the
alcohol
heat
is
noticable
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
coating
and
a
bit
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
this
isnt
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
tried
but
id
certainly
try
this
again
in
the
future
i
think
its
a
decent
overall
brew
its
drinkable
because
im
ready
to
move
on
to
the
next
one
but
seriously
theres
not
a
lot
of
complexity
going
on
here
so
its
easier
to
drink
than
other
barleywines
the
10
its
hiding
creeps
up
on
you
while
im
never
disappointed
that
i
tried
a
new
beer
i
honestly
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
d
big
abv
but
still
pretty
tasty
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
one
finger
head
that
settles
into
a
thick
collar
medium
carbonation
aroma
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
sweet
dark
fruit
1st
sip
is
malty
slightly
sweet
with
a
surprisingly
balanced
hop
bitterness
some
more
of
the
dark
fruit
date
fig
sweetness
comes
through
with
a
very
slight
alcohol
burn
almost
too
slight
for
a
10
abv
beer
mouthfeel
is
slightly
tingly
from
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
almost
too
high
for
a
beer
this
potent
this
is
definetly
a
beer
that
could
sneak
up
on
you
bite
you
in
the
ass
if
youre
not
careful
all
in
all
excellent
beer
but
one
to
be
sipped
slowly
carefully
d
10
abv
hidden
well
until
approaching
room
temperature
when
served
cool
40s
there
is
nothing
that
makes
you
think
this
is
anything
but
a
good
crisp
esb
as
it
warms
up
more
flavors
develop
and
the
alcohol
shows
d
oh
my
if
it
werent
for
the
abv
i
could
imagine
sitting
with
bottles
of
this
all
day
long
rich
and
fulfilling
somewhat
heavy
this
is
an
extremely
enjoyable
brew
the
abv
is
high
but
thats
to
style
so
overall
its
quite
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
be
reaching
for
a
second
in
the
same
sitting
excellent
beer
im
going
to
get
a
few
more
and
see
how
they
taste
with
some
more
age
on
them
my
first
beer
of
what
i
believe
was
a
4pack
i
didnt
think
id
give
this
beer
much
of
a
chance
but
now
that
im
on
my
last
bottle
of
it
im
liking
it
more
then
i
did
one
my
first
however
this
beer
is
rather
dark
im
tempted
to
say
big
but
i
dont
think
that
would
be
the
correct
word
maybe
its
the
alcohol
or
just
the
style
itself
i
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
never
drinking
it
again
well
i
think
i
quite
very
well
might
now
pour
is
deep
red
amber
with
a
head
of
cream
some
what
of
a
large
head
even
smell
is
nothing
but
unsalted
crackers
and
wood
pulp
and
an
undertone
of
apple
malt
i
would
say
average
but
really
something
i
wouldnt
expect
one
of
doughest
barley
wines
ive
had
subtle
fruity
malt
character
neutral
hop
quality
somewhat
warm
but
well
hidden
alcohol
to
be
fair
barleywine
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
ive
been
trying
all
the
clipper
city
offerings
after
having
the
loose
cannon
which
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
line
ive
been
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
others
and
this
is
no
exception
though
its
aroma
is
fine
stylewise
its
not
a
personal
favorite
and
would
keep
me
from
drinking
this
one
again
d
could
only
drink
a
couple
of
these
strong
flavor
and
alcohol
when
pearl
jams
vitalogy
came
out
i
bought
it
without
hearing
anything
about
the
album
i
just
bought
it
because
of
the
quality
of
the
previous
two
albums
after
listening
to
it
i
thought
it
was
basically
a
piece
of
crap
well
this
beer
was
a
similar
experience
i
bought
a
case
knowing
that
i
have
loved
other
clipper
city
heavy
seas
offerings
boy
that
was
a
mistake
now
im
stuck
with
a
barleywine
that
left
me
very
disappointed
flat
looking
bland
smelling
dustycardboard
tasting
this
is
a
subpar
beer
i
guess
cellaring
it
like
the
label
suggests
might
help
but
i
doubt
it
would
help
much
my
advice
is
to
avoid
this
beer
not
worth
the
price
d
not
that
great
one
or
two
only
but
i
think
that
the
style
calls
for
that
level
of
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
i
agree
with
another
review
that
this
is
the
best
in
the
bangforyourbuck
category
i
found
a
12pack
of
heavy
seas
assortment
pack
for
only
15
95
in
the
columbia
sc
area
the
6packs
go
for
8
95
you
do
the
math
final
thoughts
i
was
impressed
by
heavy
seas
barleywine
i
love
extreme
beers
but
this
was
not
over
the
top
definitely
a
good
way
to
introduce
people
to
barleywine
or
a
way
for
more
knowledgeable
individuals
to
enjoy
an
easier
drinking
one
for
the
money
you
wont
find
a
better
12
oz
bottle
of
brew
imo
clipper
citys
35
heavy
seas
assortment
pack
is
the
best
case
in
the
bangforyourbuck
category
very
well
done
2008
vintage
on

pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
lots
of
suspended
yeast
are
present
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
alcohol
some
yeast
cleanliness
and
some
strong
biscuit
aromas
fits
the
style
of
an
english
barleywine
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
strongly
of
alcohol
biscuit
flavors
next
sweet

background
some
very
slight

with
an
alcohol

not
a
real
great
blend
overall
too
light
in
body
besides
the
alcohol
first
review
of
a
beer
ever
let
me
know
how
i
did
and
how
i
can
improve
below
decks
isnt
the
best
heavy
seas
brew
but
its
an
enjoyable
little
sipper
if
you
arent
expecting
the
moon
and
the
stars
with
easy
access
id
probably
grab
a
single
now
and
again
thanks
to
skinnyelvis
for
coming
through
after
i
dropped
my
first
bottle
on
my
basement
floor
this
will
be
my
last
beer
of
the
night
after
a
good
dinner
out
sort
of
a
nightcap
appearance
is
a
nice
rose
color
with
about
half
a
finger
of
white
head
good
nose
of
sweet
stone
fruit
honey
caramel
little
bit
of
chocolate
taste
has
some
honey
sweetness
some
sherry
or
perhaps
port
characteristics
raisins
tiny
alcohol
burn
chewier
mouthfeel
than
i
was
anticipating
with
the
malt
riding
shotgun
to
the
hops
one
is
enough
as
far
as
drinking
this
beer
but
it
is
still
a
tasty
treat
clipper
city
did
a
nice
job
with
this
beer
it
certainly
seems
to
stand
as
a
unique
brew
not
only
because
of
its
style
but
also
for
its
interesting
traits
cheers
d
honestly
its
a
bit
green
and
lacking
in
the
complexity
i
prefer
in
a
huge
abv
barleywine
it
does
however
get
a
bit
more
approachable
as
it
warms
wow
this
was
an
unexpected
treat
ive
not
had
it
fresh
but
this
bottle
would
seem
to
indicate
that
giving
it
some
time
to
sit
around
brings
out
the
best
very
nice
englishstyle
barleywine
the
beer
is
surprisingly
lighter
bodied
with
light
carbonation
all
of
these
factors
blend
together
into
one
of
the
best
drinking
barleywines
i
have
had
to
date
the
hoppiness
makes
this
one
a
bit
more
american
in
style
definitely
one
i
recommend
this
is
not
a
bad
barleywine
but
in
an
increasingly
crowded
niche
this
one
does
not
stand
out
overall
i
dont
know
not
bad
but
nothing
else
try
it
if
for
no
other
reason
that
to
get
drunk
d
it
was
good
to
get
one
on
the
way
out
i
would
not
want
two
a
little
to
strong
but
still
i
would
want
one
nice
looking
pour
with
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
and
thin
off
white
head
healthy
aroma
of
caramel
dark
fruit
candy
and
hints
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
just
like
the
aroma
with
plum
date
and
cherry
flavored
hard
candy
beyond
that
are
mild
caramelized
malts
and
caramel
candy
flavors
near
the
end
there
seems
to
be
a
faint
toffee
note
this
could
probably
use
a
bit
more
age
this
is
definitely
a
good
example
of
its
style
its
smoothdrinkable
and
proof
that
barleywines
dont
always
need
to
be
aged
to
be
enjoyed
tastes
better
than
it
smells
heavy
malt
sweet
and
sugary
with
nodes
of
fine
wood
bourbon
campfires
and
pixie
sticks
along
with
medium
hops
generic
tasting
and
lightly
bitter
nothing
remarkable
even
if
its
old
i
expect
a
bw
to
age
better
than
this
still
not
bad
feel
is
in
the
normal
range
for
a
bw
standard
thats
is
what
this
beer
says
to
me
solid
but
certainly
not
trying
to
push
any
boundaries
purchased
a
single
at
liquor
world
in
porter
sq
poured
into
my
bulbous
dfh
snifter
reddish
brown
color
less
head
that
i
would
like
to
see
on
a
barleywine
erratic
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
a
bit
fruity
but
also
very
boozy
taste
was
pretty
straightforward
lots
of
hops
dried
raisins
some
pear
and
molasses
were
on
my
palate
somewhat
slick
i
e
oily
coating
on
the
back
on
my
throat
high
abv
is
definitely
present
a
decent
barleywine
but
a
bit
harsh
going
down
worth
a
try
but
not
something
im
buying
again
drinkabillity
strong
this
is
a
fireside
sipper
thick
feel
syrup
left
on
the
palate
middling
carbonation
it
does
provide
some
prickliness
that
coincides
nicely
with
the
slight
spice
kick
didnt
enjoy
this
one
in
the
mouth
much
as
an
english
barleywine
i
was
expecting
a
heavily
malty
but
balanced
brew
this
is
just
too
much
cloying
caramel
sticky
sweetness
theres
some
brown
sugar
and
general
maltiness
as
well
but
the
caramel
dominates
to
the
point
of
distraction
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
background
if
you
search
for
it
mouthfeel
is
good
if
you
can
ignore
all
the
sweetness
but
i
had
to
drainpour
the
last
couple
of
ounces
all
that
sweetness
really
limits
the
drinkability
drinkability
one
of
the
more
disappointing
heavy
seas
brews
in
my
opinion
this
ones
just
a
little
too
green
too
estery
and
medicinal
in
its
fruity
notes
and
slightly
too
hot
maybe
with
a
little
age
on
it
and
a
little
more
malt
substance
to
counteract
the
yeast
activity
this
would
be
a
great
english
barleywine
i
may
pick
up
another
to
age
for
a
little
while
much
more
fruity
than
perhaps
is
the
norm
or
even
really
desirable
for
a
barleywine
but
easily
quaffable
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
so
as
this
10
abv
bomb
comes
back
to
haunt
the
head
a
few
minutes
later
not
as
much
of
a
warmer
as
barleywines
tend
to
be
but
perhaps
a
bit
of
aging
might
do
this
one
some
justice
could
benefit
from
some
more
complexity
in
the
malt
character
bring
in
some
sherrylike
oxidation
notes
and
perhaps
a
more
varied
ester
profile
and
this
would
drink
even
better
none
the
less
i
am
curious
to
see
what
my
last
bottle
will
taste
like
when
i
get
around
to
cracking
it
open
in
the
next
few
years
overall
this
is
not
a
great
barleywine
it
is
definitely
warming
me
up
on
this
cold
penn
state
night
but
not
one
i
will
reach
for
again
between
the
slight
sweetness
and
the
10abv
which
is
very
well
masked
btw
this
would
be
hard
to
put
down
more
than
a
couple
in
a
sitting
very
good
flavor
but
it
would
lay
you
out
if
you
gave
it
the
chance
drinkability
is
high
i
really
dig
this
barleywine
and
it
has
huge
sentimental
value
in
terms
of
reminding
me
of
my
childhood
in
baltimore
and
my
early
adult
years
in
pittsburgh
where
i
first
discovered
and
purchased
this
particular
beer
factor
in
that
its
a
great
value
and
youve
got
a
real
winner
sadly
i
cant
get
it
on
any
type
of
regular
basis
any
more
oh
well
the
good
news
is
i
still
have
friends
in
town
who
i
will
surely
hit
up
for
a
resupply
while
i
havent
had
this
fresh
im
sure
it
should
be
aged
at
least
as
long
as
the
two
years
i
did
it
certainly
didnt
taste
like
it
was
getting
to
old
but
very
well
rounded
d
tasty
with
an
interesting
aroma
but
i
think
one
is
enough
got
it
in
a
multi
pack
so
the
other
two
will
go
in
the
cellar
for
my
first
barleywine
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
like
to
compare
it
to
more
recent
vintages
to
see
the
effect
that
aging
had
on
it
the
feel
is
medium
with
a
touch
of
slickness
alcohol
noticeable
making
it
a
sipper
to
be
sure
but
for
alcohol
level
and
style
it
is
certainly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
too
a
year
spent
in
a
cool
dark
place
does
this
ale
just
right
delightful
for
a
night
cap
with
some
fruit
cake
cookies
edit
with
almost
three
years
on
it
the
heat
has
faded
completely
very
easy
drinking
beer
now
overall
this
is
basically
straight
up
average
nothing
exceptional
about
it
a
very
blah
barleywine
i
wont
get
it
again
d
this
one
goes
down
surprisingly
easily
it
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
robust
and
aggressive
but
it
tastes
good
and
packs
a
wallop
nonetheless
12oz
bottle
thanks
to
vwcraig
nice
ruby
color
with
an
oily
smattering
of
a
head
this
smells
like
cherries
and
eggnog
christmas
oddly
tastes
like
more
malt
candy
hmm
this
was
a
little
thin
but
i
am
always
game
for
a
barleywine
thanks
again
for
the
trade
craig
d
this
is
a
mixed
bag
of
a
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
undrinkable
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
mouthfeelmalty
sweey
with
the
dried
fruit
flavors
really
dominating
fig
and
raisin
the
alcohol
is
present
but
warming
had
this
been
drank
fresh
it
would
have
been
hot
a
froth
on
the
palate
heightens
the
fruit
and
alcohol
and
the
flavors
stay
consistant
the
finish
leaves
a
very
faint
bitternessthe
hops
were
once
here
but
have
mellowedvery
english
this
one
aged
nicely
and
was
agreat
finish
to
the
thanksgiving
day
festivities
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
foamy
white
head
very
hoppy
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
sweet
alochol
very
hoppy
balancing
out
the
dark
fruit
and
alcohiol
sweetness
quite
nicely
sweet
with
nice
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
price
point
makes
me
want
to
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
to
see
how
some
time
on
it
would
be
an
average
barley
wine
from
a
brewery
ive
come
to
expect
above
average
products
from
i
was
a
little
disappointed
what
this
beer
lacks
in
appearance
and
aroma
it
makes
up
for
in
great
taste
and
drinkability
smells
of
just
alcohol
and
isnt
a
very
appealing
pour
but
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
taste
with
an
slight
alcohol
warming
kick
it
finishes
clean
and
smooth
as
well
one
of
the
better
barley
wines
ive
had
d
outstanding
i
continue
to
want
more
sips
as
the
last
one
lingers
and
teases
d
outstanding
beer
not
the
best
ive
had
but
damn
close
this
is
definitely
hanging
close
to
that
highest
echelon
of
good
beer
this
is
however
more
drinkable
than
some
more
aggressive
barleywines
and
i
could
probably
drink
two
or
three
though
id
be
a
little
bit
tipsy
after
more
than
one
poured
a
ruby
color
with
a
decent
head
that
retained
fairly
well
aromas
of
fruits
galore
cherries
figs
pie
filling
apples
lots
of
sweet
malts
tastes
of
more
fruity
malty
goodness
lots
of
apples
cherries
plums
etc
going
on
in
here
with
a
good
dose
of
hoppiness
alcohol
was
definitely
detected
but
less
hot
than
a
fresh
batch
fairly
warming
going
down
mouthfeel
was
pretty
velvety
but
not
as
rich
as
a
lot
of
barleywines
not
too
much
carbonation
and
slick
not
a
bad
example
here
from
clipper
city
not
the
greatest
of
bws
but
very
palatable
and
enjoyable
thanks
to
crazymacharris99
for
the
bottle
d
a
formidable
beer
could
have
been
a
little
thicker
on
the
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
was
pretty
good
while
the
alcohol
was
warming
you
could
not
really
taste
it
at
all
which
i
find
to
be
a
good
thing
overall
a
pretty
good
barleywine
and
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
d
a
good
if
somewhat
onedimensional
barleywine
this
strattles
an
interesting
line
between
american
and
english
interpretations
of
the
style
not
as
smooth
as
id
like
but
still
a
great
beer
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
got
this
one
cause
ive
been
fairly
impressed
with
the
clipper
city
stuff
ive
had
so
far
good
price
fairly
solid
beer
although
the
imperial
stout
was
a
disappointment
this
one
is
more
of
the
same
in
my
book
a
surprisingly
hoppy
barley
wine
especially
one
pretending
in
my
book
to
be
english
which
in
my
experience
are
usually
a
lot
maltier
this
one
would
seem
to
be
almost
a
malty
ipa
a
lot
of
malt
flavor
to
be
sure
quite
fruity
but
that
hops
really
dominates
fairly
straightforward
in
both
the
smells
and
tastes
with
a
strong
caramel
malt
and
stronger
fruity
hops
throughout
definitely
alcohol
presence
in
there
but
its
not
bad
solid
beer
overall
poured
a
dark
caramel
color
with
almost
no
head
or
caronation
nose
was
of
malts
and
some
caramel
taste
was
roasty
caramel
flavor
is
what
you
get
at
the
beginning
and
there
is
not
much
to
say
for
the
mid
palate
and
aftertaste
not
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
not
that
appealing
great
drinkability
for
the
abv
style
damn
good
english
bw
d
pretty
nice
barleywine
overall
i
should
try
one
fresh
for
comparison
purposes
this
was
the
2007
bottling
decent
enough
barleywine
which
could
be
better
balanced
i
like
the
dark
fruit
flavor
but
the
alltoonoticable
abv
causes
the
drinkability
to
suffer
exceptionally
smooth
with
nice
carbonation
nice
drinkability
for
the
style
a
sweeter
barleywine
than
im
used
too
not
bad
but
all
the
sweetness
makes
it
less
of
a
drinker
for
me
this
2006
barley
wine
pours
a
nice
clear
red
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
the
aroma
is
very
malty
not
quite
enough
hops
to
really
stand
out
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
very
nice
with
a
lot
of
malt
character
and
a
dry
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
for
me
but
the
warmth
makes
up
for
that
worth
a
shot
but
better
barleywines
are
out
there
i
wanna
try
a
younger
bottle
well
18
months
certainly
did
this
bottle
good
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
this
one
again
maybe
even
do
a
vertical
tasting
with
it
heed
the
label
and
stay
below
decks
if
your
planning
a
night
with
this
contemplative
baby
drinkability
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
awhile
ago
and
remember
not
being
impressed
aging
has
done
this
one
some
good
2005
on
the
label
5313
on
the
bottom
so
about
2
5
years
im
very
impressed
i
must
locate
my
other
3
or
4
bottles
its
not
very
heavy
on
the
tongue
id
certainly
call
it
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
is
about
right
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
more
approachable
barleywines
although
it
can
lull
one
into
a
false
sense
of
security
soon
with
that
10abv
a
mahogany
colored
brew
with
amber
tints
good
carbonation
keeps
the
twofinger
around
for
a
minute
and
left
some
lacings
down
the
mug
a
slightly
heavy
alcohol
smell
with
a
good
base
of
sweet
malts
caramel
honey
syrup
also
something
woody
in
there
as
well
a
good
hop
presence
as
well
a
rather
thickbodied
beer
it
packs
a
malty
punch
on
the
first
sip
with
the
sweet
malts
kicking
in
gear
but
balanced
with
a
dryness
from
some
hops
and
oak
or
some
wood
not
perfectly
balanced
but
a
sweetness
is
there
as
well
as
the
alcohol
hidden
for
the
most
part
and
hops
for
a
good
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
i
just
couldnt
session
it
if
i
wanted
to
toasted
biscuit
malts
up
front
give
way
to
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
some
sugary
fruits
as
well
singed
almost
roasted
quality
turns
into
herbal
hop
bitterness
gets
a
little
boozy
and
rummy
in
the
finish
a
little
bit
hot
fullbodied
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
not
too
bad
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
a
wonderful
sipper
drinkablity
given
the
abv10
this
isnt
that
bad
went
through
one
pretty
easy
and
i
wish
i
had
another
to
keep
the
1st
one
company
d
if
you
havent
tried
clipper
city
brews
you
need
to
the
heavy
seas
line
is
outstanding
and
this
one
is
no
different
10
packs
a
punch
so
dont
have
too
many
but
an
excellent
english
barleywine
this
barleywine
is
a
pretty
clear
copper
color
with
a
medium
light
tan
head
and
blanketing
lace
it
has
a
beautiful
aroma
of
nutty
malt
and
mild
fruit
nougat
hops
the
taste
is
malty
and
creamy
with
a
grassy
back
i
pick
up
horshoundroot
beer
hints
sweet
with
good
alcohol
but
not
too
heavy
even
carbonation
and
reasonably
drinkable
for
a
barley
wine
very
nice
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
and
isjust
a
little
lighter
around
the
edges
the
tan
white
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
thin
white
filmy
ring
that
clings
to
the
glass
pretty
well
smells
of
a
dull
wine
with
a
sweet
tinge
to
it
tastes
pretty
much
like
i
would
expect
a
decent
barleywine
to
taste
a
little
sweet
with
an
earthy
malt
and
sweet
bread
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinck
as
the
alcohol
hits
first
and
really
doesnt
let
go
too
easily
its
somewhat
drinkable
for
a
barleywine
i
really
dont
think
one
should
make
a
night
out
of
drinking
barleywine
unless
you
want
a
seriously
bad
morning
d
its
a
good
barleywine
that
definitely
is
worth
having
more
than
one
this
is
a
good
beer
at
10
its
easy
drinking
its
a
more
mellow
barley
wine
but
very
good
just
the
same
12oz
bottle
purchased
from
bauer
wines
in
boston
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
the
aroma
is
sweet
too
sweet
im
scared
before
the
first
sip
first
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
worried
about
phew
though
it
still
has
a
good
wallop
of
sweetness
which
isnt
really
my
thing
i
think
it
is
sherry
flavours
that
this
beer
has
but
im
not
sure
because
i
never
drink
sherry
but
its
one
of
those
flavours
that
used
to
make
me
think
i
didnt
like
barley
wines
pours
a
dark
copper
hue
with
little
to
mention
about
the
head
smells
of
apples
prunes
raisins
and
yet
nothing
to
powerful
the
palate
actually
is
quite
light
really
the
nose
completely
dominates
everything
leaving
the
palate
feel
left
out
the
alcohol
shows
at
the
finish
in
a
way
thats
very
clean
and
not
offensive
a
very
drinkable
barley
wine
although
very
simplistic
cheers
d
the
beer
gets
bigger
as
it
gets
warmer
with
some
boozy
alcohol
coming
through
making
this
a
big
warming
barleywine
style
with
moderate
good
drinkability
and
it
does
not
disappoint
first
taste
is
very
strong
malt
sweetness
followed
by
alcohol
bitterness
dark
dried
fruit
and
candied
oranges
come
to
mind
the
high
alcohol
content
consistently
comes
into
play
its
almost
brandylike
in
some
ways
overall
its
a
very
very
flavorful
fullbodied
and
voluptuous
beer
thanks
vwcraig
for
the
chance
to
try
the
2008
version
which
tastes
pretty
similar
although
the
hops
are
more
prominent
as
it
has
not
aged
as
long
as
my
previous
tasting
eric
d
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
easy
almost
too
smooth
to
be
called
a
barleywine
this
sweet
tasty
offering
disguises
its
alcohol
content
better
than
most
this
poured
a
dark
clear
copper
with
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
honey
wheat
with
a
bit
of
sourness
it
tasted
like
hops
and
wheat
mixed
with
some
honey
but
not
too
sweet
it
was
moderately
thick
with
a
little
carbonation
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
wasnt
easy
to
drink
but
not
overly
powerful
either
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
barleywines
ive
had
since
it
kept
its
flavor
in
moderation
an
exceptionally
bland
and
tasteless
barleywine
surprisingly
the
10
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
that
being
said
this
beer
is
good
for
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
getting
drunk
forget
the
30
of
natty
funnel
6
of
these
puppies
and
youll
be
felching
fatties
in
no
time
this
is
a
good
but
fairly
straightforward
barleywine
there
are
certainly
better
ones
around
yet
this
is
worth
having
and
definitely
enjoyable
recommended
a
representative
example
of
the
english
style
barleywine
there
is
no
super
hoppiness
like
in
american
styles
and
a
lighter
bitterness
but
still
a
nice
sipping
beer
d
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
but
there
are
so
many
other
english
barleywines
i
like
better
i
do
not
know
how
often
i
will
have
it
definitely
not
the
best
barleywine
ive
tried
but
this
one
was
still
a
solid
and
enjoyable
sample
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
i
wasnt
really
into
this
on
the
first
couple
tries
but
its
winning
me
over
slowly
maybe
my
preferences
for
the
aggressive
u
s
versions
kept
me
from
appreciating
its
more
subtle
take
on
the
style
because
of
its
thickness
and
higher
abv
and
also
because
if
im
going
to
choose
a
barleywine
id
choose
many
others
over
this
drinkability
is
merely
okay
all
in
all
absolutely
worth
a
try
give
it
a
few
chances
its
kind
of
a
grower
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
very
well
balanced
and
not
overpowering
o
im
a
bit
new
at
barleywines
but
ive
had
several
and
i
like
this
one
a
lot
i
think
the
subtlety
of
the
flavours
rounds
out
the
intensity
of
the
alcohol
impressively
a
very
big
beer
hiding
under
a
small
table
or
something
either
way
i
recommend
it
overall
not
half
bad
at
all
i
will
admit
that
i
have
had
better
barleywines
over
the
years
there
is
no
doubt
regarding
this
but
this
was
still
a
solid
offering
and
really
well
done
one
of
the
more
mellow
ones
out
there
and
if
you
are
just
looking
to
get
into
the
style
this
might
be
a
good
place
to
start
definitly
worth
a
try
pours
a
clear
chestnut
red
color
with
little
head
to
speak
of
big
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
malty
figs
dates
brown
sugar
those
were
the
things
that
came
to
mind
as
i
was
drinking
it
hops
are
barely
present
a
bit
sweet
but
not
cloying
mouthfeel
is
on
the
medium
side
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
worth
a
try
would
i
buy
this
one
again
probably
not
just
because
there
are
better
barleywines
to
be
had
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
pours
a
deep
almost
burgundy
color
with
one
finger
of
light
tan
head
the
receeds
cleanly
off
the
side
of
teh
glass
aroma
is
alcoholy
some
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
taste
is
alright
it
is
sweet
alcoholy
some
caramel
notes
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
slightly
syrupy
drinkability
is
good
but
at
10
abv
it
can
overwhelm
i
thought
this
beer
would
mellow
out
with
over
a
year
under
its
belt
but
it
seems
to
have
gotten
stronger
its
slightly
above
average
drinkability
being
at
10abv
i
doubt
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
then
again
never
say
never
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
drinkability
for
a
barleywine
this
is
pretty
smooth
lack
of
alcoholic
character
helps
it
out
quite
a
bit
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
color

carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
which
leaves
some
nice
small
islands
and
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
sweet
some
toffeecaramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
spicy
and
toffeecaramel
the
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
with
this
one
as
in
not
overpowering
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
treat
for
sure

the

caramel

being
the
biggest
flavor
and
once
again
fruityestery
flavors
are
also
present
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
beer
but
its
a
bit
wimpy
by
barley
wine
standards
by
the
way
this
is
definitely
an
english
stlye
barley
wine
as
the
hops
really
arent
noticeable
i
enjoyed
it
its
worth
a
try
i
made
myself
sit
and
finish
in
hopes
that
it
would
open
from
warming
and
time
but
the
taste
did
not
change
d
one
of
the
best
balanced
and
barleywines
ive
had
rich
tasty
and
drinkable
notes
this
reminded
me
of
a
cross
between
an
oakaged
strong
ale
and
a
barleywine
as
i
really
got
a
pretty
strong
sense
of
wood
i
prefer
my
barleywines
to
have
a
bit
more
of
a
hoppy
presence
american
hops
so
i
didnt
love
this
one
it
wasnt
bad
just
not
my
personal
preference
for
the
style
theres
a
nice
balance
for
the
style
a
nice
interpretation
of
an
englishstyle
barleywine
with
a
touch
more
fruitiness
alcohol
noticeable
making
it
a
sipper
to
be
sure
but
for
alcohol
level
and
style
it
is
certainly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
too

this

with

a

its
a
good
break
from
the
dominant
american
barley
wines
found
here
in
the
u
s
after
a
year
or
two
this
one
settles
down
nicely
to
become
smooth

malty

fresh
or
aged
d
this
is
just
kind
of
a
beast
with

is

will
not

a
clear
but
dark
brown
no
head
nose
is
kind
of
a
roasted
thing
going
on
with
some
fruits
in
there
as
well
its
fairly
mild
flavor
has
a
big
zing
to
it
noticeable
alcohol
and
an
almost
meaty
texture
to
it
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
was
okay
i
feel
like
it
is
either
way
too
tight
and
needs
to
sleep
for
a
lot
longer
or
it
is
just
lacking
and
will
never
show
an
interesting
side
nice
to
try
but
probably
should
have
waited
at
least
2
or
3
more
years
or
more
to
see
it
at
its
best
if
it
can
get
to
that
point
at
all
d
pretty
solid
but
doesnt
quite
have
the
kick
of
an
old
guardian
or
y2k
catastrophe
ale
but
it
is
pretty
malt
driven
example
as
opposed
to
hops
and
works
quite
well
on
that
front
i
think
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
if
it
were
a
scottish
ale
but
its
lacking
a
little
bit
of
everything
a
barleywine
needs
goes
down
quick
because
of
the
light
body
at
10
which
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
is
really
a
way
you
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
without
feeling
weigheddown
ive
had
a
lot
of
barley
wines
both
english
and
american
and
this
is
quite
possibly
the
tamest
one
ive
ever
had
its
like
a
typical
microbrew
pale
ale
but
just
up
a
notch
slightly
i
wouldnt
even
know
its
barely
wine
if
i
hadnt
read
the
label
its
not
bad
in
any
way
at
all
just
very
tame

doesnt
quite

up
not
at
all
bad
but
not
something
id
crave
decent
not
fantastic
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
and
full
bodied
not
syrupy
but
still
thick
and
velvety
very
nice
english
style
barleywine
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
of
their
best
drinkable
but
not
very
memorable
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
deal
or
someone
else
is
buying
md
carbonation
is
tad
high
body
is
full
but
could
use
some
bolstering
drinkability
is
lower
than
expected
after
first
look
and
smell
the
taste
is
just
so
off
a
nice
example
of
the
style
nothing
earthshattering
but
still
quite
worthy
i
cellared
this
bottle
for
over
a
year
and
it
does
seem
to
have
helped
it
this
one
is
decent
no
off
flavors
nothing
overpowering
id
prefer
to
see
it
with
less
residual
sweetness
like
an
old
ale
a
sweet
one
that
is
this
beer
has
a
nice
dark
camber
color
with
a
short
white
head
with
a
copper
tint
the
beer
smells
alot
like
brew
made
from
malt
extract
it
has
a
fruitywiney
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
good
with
a
sweet
hint
of
barley
malt
it
has
a
real
fruity
flavor
like
a
wine
would
have
the
high
alcohol
is
not
readily
detectable
until
later
on
in
the
aftertaste
it
has
a
really
high
carbonation
for
a
beer
of
this
body
but
it
really
does
it
justice
in
disguising
the
high
alcohol
it
is
failry
drinkable
and
probably
no
more
than
1
or
2
because
of
the
high
content
and
very
strong
flavor
worth
a
try

brew

has
some
biting
alcohol
and
fruity
flavors
thrown
in
the
finish

dry
and
mildly
bitter
overall
this
beer
seems
kind
of
disjointed
not
sure
i
would
bother
with
it
again
drinkability
let
this
brew
warm
up
and
calm
down
alcohol
at
10
is
very
noticeable
ill
drink
the
next
one
as
a
nightcap
at
the
end
of
a
special
day
maybe
a
year
from
now
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into

delirium
tremens

appearance
was
nice
burgandy
colored
clear
with

thin
white
ring

the
smell
wasnt
too
bad
either
sweet
and
malty
with
hints
of
old
nick
or
bigfoot
but
everything
went
to
hell
once
i
tasted
it
bleck
the
alcohol
was
really
apparent
not
masked
or
anything
and
the
flavor
was
intensely
bitter
in
a
biting
and
unappealing
way
just
not
good
at
all
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
i
wont
likely
try
it
ever
again

the

nicely
in

just
a

taste
lowered
my
rating
a
bit
worth
a
try
relatively
average
mouthfeel
with
a
sweet
fullbodied
finish
coming
up
to
temperature
the
beer
improves
but
doesnt
salvage
the
whole
experience
not
a
great
barleywine
this
was
simple
bottled
too
soon
i
dont
have
hope
that
its
worth
the
space
in
my
cellar
pours

apple

earthy
notes
the
taste
starts
malty
upfront
displaying
a
citrus
bitterness
that
helps
to
balance
this
beer
the
finish
is
smooth
boozey
and
traditional
english
style
overall
this
is
a
nice
barleywine
one
that
brings
a
little
old
world
flavor
on
the
palate
drinkability
great
considering
the
alcohol
content
im
impressed
not
too
thick
or
heavy
in
the
mouth
carbonation
is
light
this
will
hopefully
do
much
better
in
a
year
or
more
gonna
save
the
other
two
until
then
seems
like
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
ill
seek
out
again
dark
red
translucent
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
like
caramel
malt
with
strong
hints
of
alcohol
tastes
sweet
with
biscuit
and
caramel
malts
playing
a
strong
role
slightly
alcoholic
on
the
finish
as
well
as
having
a
slight
hint
of
hops
syrupy
and
creamy
in
its
thickness
predictably
not
as
drinkable
as
many
other
beers
but
more
drinkable
than
some
other
examples
of
the
style
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
a
decent
barley
wine
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
alcohol
burn
may
be
a
little
harsh
for
some
people
as
with
most
barley
wines
i
am
looking
forward
to
what
cellaring
will
do
to
the
character
certainly
worth
a
try
beer
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
into
my
tulip
glass
looked
lika
glass
of
iced
tea
very
little
head
just
a
slight
ring
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
citrusy
slight
hints
of
the
high
abv
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
upfront
with
some
citrus
notes
rounding
things
out
the
high
abv
is
evident
but
it
does
not
hit
you
over
the
head
d
lacks
balance
and
has
some
real
undesirable
aspects
to
it
i
cant
get
this
dirty
flavor
out
of
my
mouth
id
pass
on
this
one
this
one
is
better
than
the
overall
rating
suggests
so
i
felt
it
necessary
to
put
my
two
cents
in
this
is
a
barley
wine
with
the
consistency
of
a
stout
and
the
sweetness
of
certain
belgian
dubbels
i
have
had
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
long
term
drinking
but
has
a
very
nice
strong
malt
taste
with
a
bite
of
alcohol
at
the
end
this
one
should
probably
be
aged
for
about
a
year
to
get
its
full
potential
this
amberorange
beer
poured
pretty
clear
with
a
light
beige
foam
that
quickly
fell
to
a
ring
and
left
behind
a
bit
of
fine
lace
pleasant
enough
aroma
oranges
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
but
it
also
had
a
bit
of
mustiness
and
vegetal
character
to
it
the
flavour
was
thin
especially
for
a
barleywine
it
was
sticky
sweet
fruity
think
tangerine
or
orange
character
from
hops
with
a
little
alcohol
warmth
thick
low
attenuation
with
carbonation
on
the
low
side
made
for
a
texture
that
was
a
bit
of
a
mess
it
wasnt
offensive
at
all
but
just
not
what
i
consider
a
good
or
even
passable
english
barleywine
the
flavour
that
was
present
fell
away
by
the
finish
and
it
had
little
in
the
way
of
complexity
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
over
the
course
of
about
three
hours
so
its
definately
a
sipping
beer
it
became
more
complex
as
it
warmed
but
the
roasted
coffee
flavor
was
front
and
center
this
might
age
well
so
i
think
ill
squirrel
a
few
away
for
about
two
years
the
beers
pours
a
beautiful
amber
mahogany
color
with
excellent
head
retention
and
very
good
lacing
on
the
nose
there
is
a
huge
blast
of
citrus
from
the
hops
along
with
some
undeerelying
malty
sweetness
on
the
palate
one
gets
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
again
but
with
an
excellent
citrus
back
drop
from
the
hops
flavors
included
cherry
cough
drop
almonds
citrus
and
some
addtional
nuttiness
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
soft
mouthfeel
and
is
suprisingly
smooth
the
beer
is
also
surprisingly
drinkable
and
the
abv
not
all
that
noticeable
the
beer
finishes
with
a
long
lingering
hoppy
finish
quite
a
good
beer
pours
a
dark
brownish
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
malty
aroma
displays
some
caramel
flavors
as
well
as
some
phenols
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
smooth
malts
flavors
and
ends
with
the
hops
bringing
up
the
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
barley
wine
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way
to
make
it
worthy
of
a
repeat
purchase
red
to
crimson
with
some
floaties
in
there
and
a
soft
pillowy
head
sticky
hop
odor
some
cherries
prominent
alcohol
smell
taste
is
a
fruity
ethanol
flavor
harsh
in
its
attack
some
maltiness
but
mostly
just
a
cherry
and
ethanol
punch
thats
not
all
that
enjoyable
sticky
and
thick
and
not
all
that
great
definitely
my
least
favorite
of
an
otherwise
darn
good
series
of
beers
dont
drink
and
review
this
is
probably
the
highest
alcohol
beer
i
have
yet
to
drink
that
is
able
to
completely
hide
the
alcohol
content
while
i
was
sharing
the
bottle
with
fellow
ba
mtanji
i
checked
the
alcohol
content
and
neither
one
of
us
could
believe
it
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
wish
i
would
have
stored
it
ill
try
to
get
another
this
stuff
is
really
good
and
really
enjoyable
i
was
expecting
a
totally
different
taste
but
wow
was
i
wrong
i
wanna
drink
it
fast
but
i
know
the
alcohol
will
catch
up
with
me
so
i
must
sip
and
enjoy
it
drinkability
on
par
with
brooklyns
monster
i
think
as
im
a
fan
of
that
also
but
i
would
indeed
like
to
see
how
this
ages
especially
since
its
fairly
balanced
for
the
semigreen
stage
currently
a
nice
sipper
thats
pleasant
and
one
thats
not
too
harsh
though
it
lacks
what
many
people
may
be
looking
for
in
the
style
which
is
the
complexity
which
i
like
to
think
will
come
out
even
more
with
the
aging
d
very
tasty
but
wicked
nice
blend
of
malts
and
mellow
presence
at
first
shows
it
strength
eventually
nicely
balanced
with
a
display
of
vigor
yeah
somewhat
a
plain
jane
but
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nevertheless
i
really
liked
this
brewerys
imperial
stout
peg
leg
even
though
other
reviewers
didnt
seem
to
so
much
but
i
think
i
agree
with
everyone
else
as
far
as
this
brew
goes
i
have
another
bottle
though
so
ill
see
what
it
tastes
like
a
year
or
two
down
the
road
but
thats
just
out
of
curiosity
as
i
wouldnt
really
expect
it
to
improve
at
all

sammy
poured
a
light
amber
color
ale
with
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
dry
malt
is
quiet
weak
compared
to
what
i
was
expecting
taste
is
strong
on
cardboard
which
is
probably
due
to
oxidation
makes
me
wonder
about
that
label
mentioning
that
this
will
aged
with
the
best
of
them
i
couldnt
notice
any
hops
and
malt
was
slightly
watery
with
no
sweetness
at
all
definitely
not
something
i
would
go
back
for
in
the
future
rather
bland
mouthfeel
and
flavor
profile
with
muted
dark
fruit
overtones
hot
alcohol
and
not
much
else
with
the
exception
of
the
gorgeous
appearance
and
i
cant
really
recommend
this
one
d
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
a
barleywine
may
have
been
too
early
to
drink
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
off
whit
head
and
nice
sticky
lacing
first
note
from
the
bottle
was
alcohol
with
minimal
sweetness
not
what
i
expected
from
an
english
barleywine
not
as
sweet
as
it
should
be
not
as
hoppy
as
an
american
barleywine
in
all
its
not
as
sweet
as
it
should
be
and
a
little
too
hoppy
amost
fits
better
as
a
weak
american
bw
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
easy
to
drink
as
it
is
well
balanced
which
an
english
barleywine
shouldnt
be
the
pour
into
my
la
moneuse
glass
raises
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
over
a
deep
hazy
garnet
body
with
a
lot
of
suspended
yeast
particles
the
head
falls
lazily
leaving
pretty
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
really
nice
for
the
abv
the
nose
has
a
strong
citrus
hop
character
but
in
close
balance
with
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
kind
of
simple
though
the
taste
is
mediumsweet
caramely
and
without
much
hop
bitterness
very
balanced
and
talented
at
hiding
the
high
abv
the
mouth
is
mediumthick
with
very
light
fine
carbonation
this
would
make
a
good
intro
into
barleywines
for
novices
and
would
also
impress
many
for
its
mellow
taste
and
high
alcohol
i
was
highly
unimpressed
with
this
beer
when
first
released
however
i
think
we
have
a
whole
new
ballgame
nice
copper
color
with
a
sizeable

like
a

good
body
very
drinkable
higher

then
a
uk
barleywine
but
this
sucker
is
major
league
smooth
very
impressive
i
have
1
from
last
year
i
will
explore
again
but
the
harshness
and
low
points
from
the
first
release
are
gone
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
aroma
was
very
malty
it
had
a
good
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
was
way
too
bitter
even
for
a
barley
wine
the
alcohol
was
not
hidden
at
all
fully
showing
its
11
volume
far
from
the
top
of
my
list
when
it
comes
to
barley
wines
but
im
still
going
to
age
a
couple
and
see
if
they
improve
a
nicely
balanced
barleywind
strong
but
not
overpowering
neither
cloyingly
sweet
nor
a
hop
bomb
eminently
drinkable
cheers
had
this
as
part
of
a
blind
tasting
at
least
i
figured
it
out
was
a
barley
wine
reddish
hues
with
a
thin
wisp
of
lacing
constant
carbonation
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
appearancewise
smells
of
currants
a
bit
hoppy
fragrance
as
well
medium
body
and
not
as
hot
considering
the
alcohol
content
not
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
but
average
d
nice
flavors
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
saying
that
i
probably
wont
try
another
but
its
a
good
call
in
my
book
cheers
not
my
favorite
barleywine
yet
mouthfeel
had
the
warmth
just
lacked
the
depth
of
flavor
to
make
my
palate
say
ahhh
pours
a
clear
redamber
with
a
two
finger
head
of
dense
palebiege
soap
bubbles
decent
retention
and
weak
spotty
lacing
lots
of
crystal
malt
and
fuggles
in
the
nose
along
with
slight
appleester
and
buiscuity
malt
aromas
toasted
malts
and
caramel
flavors
upfront
followed
by
malto
dextrin
taste
and
and
nice
blend
of
soft
citrusy
american
hops
amarilloand
herbal
fuggle
hop
flavor
aftertaste
is
a
little
slick
with
the
dextrins
lingering
and
showing
signs
of
cidery
booze
then
slowly
dries
out
with
english
hop
biterness
this
demonstrates
the
balanaced
profile
of
an
englishstyle
barley
wine
fairly
well
the
carbonation
is
light
but
seems
appropriate
given
the
fullbody
and
rich
dextrinous
texture
finishes
borderline
cloying
and
certainly
residual
lots
of
toasty
caramel
and
apparent
estery
alcohol
the
english
hops
really
hold
on
and
slowly
put
the
flavor
back
in
check
to
secure
a
respectable
drinkability
flawed
by
the
onedimensiaonal
malt
and
ester
but
this
is
a
welcome
change
from
clipper
citys
underwhelming
heavy
seas
lineup
drinkable
it
sure
is
even
though
its
not
that
good
oelergud
pours
a
clear
ruby
red
with
a
large
tan
foamy
head
the
head
is
oknot
much
lacing
but
the
color
is
lighter
than
other
bws
the
smell
is
very
bisquity
with
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
aromas
nice
smell
not
too
strongbut
very
pronounced
the
taste
is
like
the
smell
alot
of
bready
yeast
some
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
its
not
badbut
the
mf
is
thinner
and
not
as
bold
compared
to
most
bws
a
good
tasting
beerbut
not
up
to
bw
styles
its
too
thin
and
weakalthough
this
does
a
good
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
i
like
it
i
just
think
it
could
be
more
tastes
sweet
with
a
tangy
orange
fruity
esters
of
apricot
tempered
by
a
mild
pepper
on
the
tongue
sweet
shows
a
brief
appearance
and
then
the
beer
finishes
quite
dry
a
bit
of
light
woody
alcohol
is
present
but
nearly
slips
by
as
it
is
quite
clean
of
fusels
mouthfeel
is
thick
holding
the
sweet
on
the
tongue
a
bit
longer
than
usual
which
is
a
good
thing
in
this
case
carbonation
is
much
too
strong
for
the
style
and
way
to
sodapop
like
flavor
is
okay
i
prefer
the
american
barleywines
but
for
an
english
i
suppose
this
is
pretty
much
right
on
style
malty
soil
and
dirt
flavors
minimal
hops
if
any
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
nice
carbonation
gives
this
beer
a
nice
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
certainly
noticeable
and
makes
this
a
one
bottle
type
beer
a
nice
english
bw
but
i
prefer
the
american
version
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
d
it
is
pretty
good
it
is
a
decent
barley
wine
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
about
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
recommend
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
but
i
would
have
to
be
cared
for
poured
a
pretty
reddishamber
color
with
a
large
2
inch
head
that
took
a
while
to
subside
i
didnt
expect
such
a
lively
head
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
aroma
was
fruity
and
malty
with
some
hints
of
grape
and
prunes
in
the
nose
taste
was
quite
fruity
and
malty
sweet
reminding
me
of
maple
syrup
and
ripe
fruit
some
alcoholic
warmth
was
noted
as
the
beer
warmed
to
room
temperature
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
light
for
such
as
strong
beer
overall
not
much
going
on
here
except
for
a
lot
of
sweet
flavors
and
alcohol
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
cellaring
is
in
order
not
a
bad
attempt
at
a
barleywine
but
a
little
boring
in
my
opinion
english
style
barleywines
in
general
have
been
more
of
a
hit
and
miss
proposition
for
me
than
their
american
style
counterparts
nonetheless
when
a
new
one
shows
up
on
the
store
shelves
i
am
pretty
much
set
on
trying
it
and
such
was
the
case
when
i
noticed
and
immediately
brought
home
a
4pack
of
below
decks
from
clipper
city
i
chose
a
duvel
tulip
for
the
primal
tasting
and
the
beer
came
of
amber
brown
in
color
and
clear
the
head
was
small
at
first
and
disintegrated
to
a
ring
of
bubbles
shortly
thereafter
the
looks
were
typical
for
the
style
but
that
is
rarely
the
point
of
a
barleywine
anyway
the
smell
was
loaded
with
a
plethora
of
fruits
which
were
hard
to
characterize
into
individual
types
there
was
also
a
salty
air
about
this
beer
which
was
appropriate
considering
the
maritime
theme
on
the
label
the
taste
was
punchy
and
not
well
melded
there
was
an
odd
clash
sweet
and
sharp
flavors
in
each
sip
with
alcohol
trying
to
play
a
spicy
but
unsuccessful
mediator
thick
bodied
but
not
soft
this
seemed
to
lack
a
lot
of
polished
qualities
at
the
time
of
release
i
think
a
couple
of
years
in
the
cellars
will
smooth
out
the
rough
edges
and
bring
the
favorable
qualities
more
to
the
forefront
at
this
time
though
this
was
a
little
too
harsh
and
aggravating
pick
up
if
you
have
some
storage
space
for
it
to
mature
this
isnt
the
most
complex
barleywine
youll
find
but
it
struck
me
as
being
very
well
rounded
with
nice
depth
of
malt
and
fruit
flavors
not
overly
sweet
and
potent
without
being
overpowering
flavorful
and
drinkable
seem
a
rare
combination
in
this
category
predominant
caramel
malt
and
raw
cane
sugar
with
raisin
and
prune
alcohol
lent
some
black
pepper
notes
at
the
end
one
of
the
few
barlewines
ive
wanted
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
although
this
might
be
illadvised
nice
intoxicating
but
nice
this
one
wasnt
bad
but
wasnt
overly
impressive
sort
of
a
middle
of
the
road
barleywine
no
real
flaws
save
for
a
very
mild
aroma
but
no
attributes
really
stick
out
either
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
the
taste
its
sweet
with
a
touch
of
savory
the
aroma
is
a
bit
thin
dimensionally
but
once
it
hits
the
lips
all
is
well
its
decently
drinkable
almost
in
spite
of
an
abv
thats
meaty
and
does
its
best
to
put
a
damper
on
things
below
deck
above
deck
whatever
deck
this
one
is
worth
a
try
by
the
side
of
the
fire
drinkability
by
no
means
an
exceptional
beer
or
even
one
that
is
complex
or
distinguishing
just
a
vague
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
served
at
nearly
room
temperature
in
a
snifter
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
poured
a
deep
brownish
red
color
with
very
little
bubbly
white
head
left
very
little
lace
on
the
glass
not
a
very
strong
smell
coming
from
my
glass
smelled
very
faintly
of
brown
sugar
whiskey
and
some
alcohol
smoothly
tasted
of
cheap
whisky
dark
dried
fruits
mostly
cherry
and
very
well
hidden
hops
had
a
warming
alcohol
finish
pretty
drinkable
fullbodied
barleywine
worth
a
shot
the
taste
wasnt
what
i
figured
on
though
after
accouple
at
11
not
at
once
the
acctual
taste
grew
on
me
sweet
malts
pine
rum
like
alcohol
warms
this
full
bodied
beer
i
like
a
good
strong
beer
thisone
is
though
i
think
its
balanced
with
alcohol
more
than
hops
hops
are
not
a
big
player
here
though
the
beer
isnt
to
sweet
to
drink
it
is
balanced
enough
to
aid
the
drinkability
well
the
mouth
is
left
alittle
dry
but
warmed
a
smooth
brew
to
be
had
worth
the
4pack
price
of
9
terrific
beer
full
of
malts
hops
alcohol
and
flavor
starts
off
with
a
burgundy
hue
and
terrific
offwhite
head
retention
flavors
of
strong
fruits
sweet
malts
and
rum
strong
fruit
flavors
of
figs
cherries
dates
raisons
and
prunes
all
fruits
seem
fresh
and
strong
like
fruitcake
malts
though
strong
dont
seem
too
syrupy
or
cloying
hopping
knoks
the
brew
out
of
the
english
barleywine
range
but
makes
for
a
good
american
barleywine
citursy
and
piney
deep
into
the
finsih
alcohols
are
a
bit
too
hot
and
harsh
but
is
a
quick
reminder
of
the
kick
that
the
brew
has
finishes
sweet
and
strong
with
a
lingering
alcohol
and
hop
character
thinnish
mouthfeel
for
the
style
i
like
these
a
bit
heavier
and
slick
carbonation
wasnt
as
evident
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
overall
good
drinkability
this
one
is
way
to
easy
to
put
down
for
its
abv
level
aroma
and
taste
arent
overly
spectactular
but
the
easy
of
drinking
helps
this
out
a
lot
always
good
to
see
people
brew
the
english
style
bw
although
they
are
rarely
so
freaking
strong
good
looking
beer
with
sublte
alcohol
and
malt
on
the
nose
buried
deep
underneath
both
was
a
maple
sweetness
surprsing
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
with
great
balance
and
mouthfeel
not
sure
why
this
was
retired
but
i
would
buy
more
and
sit
on
it
for
at
least
a
year
well
done

another
reviewer
mentioned
plastic
flavor
notes
and
this
is
a
good
description
of
what
is
going
on
here
kind
of
thin
in
the
body
and
lacking
in
the
flavor
and
complexity
departments
bwines
that
are
not
that
great
really
are
a
waste
of
brain
cells
and
not
very
enjoyable
to
even
sip
glad
i
only
picked
up
a
single
bottle
7
99
4pack
very
thin
on
the
palate
and
in
the
flavor
profile
nothing
bad
to
speak
of
aside
from
the
plastic
aftertaste
but
absolutely
nothing
stands
out
some
woody
characteristics
and
brown
sugary
malt
and
then
booze
and
then
plastic
carbonation
is
low
is
barely
stings
the
tip
of
the
tongue
hops
complexity
nay
this
is
more
adv
alcohol
delivery
vehicle
than
delicious
barleywine
not
what
i
want
in
a
barleywine
simplistic
which
can
be
fine
but
this
is
in
the
same
area
as
an
amber
ale
generalized
caramel
sweetness
mild
overall
and
a
bit
cloying
there
is
some
bitterness
but
its
so
incredibly
sweet
right
up
front
that
i
found
myself
gulping
sips
at
the
end
to
spare
myself
the
sugary
feeling
sitting
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
i
like
to
sit
and
enjoy
beers
of
this
strength
not
try
to
get
rid
of
them
maybe
good
for
someone
testing
the
waters
of
big
beer
not
quite
ready
for
the
flavor
explosion
yet
d
high
one
could
easily
pound
this
beer
sweet
with
just
enough
bitter
to
keep
it
honest
a
great
bwine
ive
always
enjoyed
this
beer
in
bottles
last
night
i
had
it
on
tap
and
was
even
more
impressed
it
starts
out
with
a
surprisingly
large
head
mellow
but
promising
aroma
and
great
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
wonderfully
malty
hops
are
subtle
but
present
the
high
alcohol
content
is
not
at
all
apparent
due
to
the
overall
smoothness
of
the
beer
this
almost
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
but
as
an
english
barleywine
it
is
supposed
to
have
that
sweetness
to
it
id
say
this
is
another
success
by
hugh
creating
another
unique
take
on
a
classic
style
that
is
both
complex
and
incredibly
drinkable
an
aside
i
once
had
this
in
firken
dry
hopped
and
its
character
was
completely
different
but
also
wonderful

meringey

nicely
with

aroma
is
so
sedate
that
i
really
dont
pick
up
anything
taste
is
overly
sweet
with
bitterness
present
as
well
later
and
a
lingering
alcoholic
bitter
close
mouthfeel
is
just
too
harsh
for
the
usually
mellow
english
style
and
drinkability
is
just
not
there
for
me
not
my
favorite
heavy
seas
brew
for
sure
overall
not
bad
but
far
from
great
poured
clear
but
dulled
copper
with
a
white
one
finger
head
after
a
hard
pouraromas
are
really
bland
for
lack
of
another
word
some
sweet
alcohol
with
drier
malt
just
nothing
going
on
but
not
bad
like
i
said
bland
as
with
the
aromas
somewhat
bland
but
a
little
more
character
sweet
alcohol
is
prevalent
along
with
some
caramel
malt
finishing
with
just
a
tinge
of
pine
but
not
enough
to
get
excited
about
this
beer
could
be
alot
better
it
has
some
good
points
but
not
enough
to
search
out
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
very
right
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
ivory
head
that
maintains
very
well
clarity
is
excellent
and
a
moderate
cascade
of
bubbles
make
their
way
to
the
top
helping
the
head
keep
its
form
nose
is
fairly
fruity
with
a
solid
caramel
and
toasty
character
a
moderate
piney
hop
and
a
puff
of
alcohol
are
in
the
backgroud
as
well
flavor
is
right
there
with
the
aroma
solid
caramel
and
toasty
british
malt
with
a
little
alcohol
interaction
in
there
that
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
chemically
flavor
this
all
fades
to
a
solid
earthy
and
piney
hop
and
a
very
solid
toastyness
this
one
is
a
bit
drying
sucking
all
the
moisture
from
the
sides
of
my
tongue
burps
are
slightly
fruity
as
well
the
apparent
alcohol
is
a
little
detracting
there
may
even
be
a
little
smokey
phenols
in
there
feel
is
thick
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
very
solid
feel
to
this
one
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
just
checked
the
abv
so
its
not
a
surprise
at
11
that
it
comes
through
a
little
in
the
flavor
i
like
the
flavor
especially
the
toastyness
that
comes
through
on
the
finish
overall
a
nice
english
barleywine
i
think
some
time
would
mellow
it
out
a
bit
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
warm
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
dry
and
slightly
bitter
hop
aroma
it
seems
to
have
some
breadlike
qualities
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
hoppy
and
warm
this
is
a
damn
good
brew
that
drinks
well
it
has
a
breadliketoasted
character
that
is
quite
outstanding
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
barley
wine
i
love
the
taste
of
this
one
an
easy
drinker
for
a
big
beer
either
way
another
brew
from
cc
worth
trying
for
me
there
are
many
others
in
the
style
i
prefer
wine
pours
a
dark
caramel
with
a
slight
quick
to
hide
head
or
pure
white
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
of
this
one
just
a
tad
of
roasty
malt
this
is
a
rather
dissapointing
barley
wine
i
had
high
expectations
for
a
roasty
caramel
flavor
is
what
you
get
at
the
beginning
and
there
is
not
much
to
say
for
the
mid
palate
and
aftertaste
not
very
complex
at
all
very
generous
hops
overall
an
average
brew
ive
enjoyed
the
heavy
seas
line
but
this
was
a
disappointment
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
one
that
does
not
come
together
its
just
too
small
barleywines
should
be
big
try
the
other
heavy
seas
beers
but
look
elsewhere
for
a
barleywine
for
11
and
as
an
english
barleywine
it
is
very
drinkable
and
not
too
heavy
overall
a
little
light
in
flavor
but
for
a
reasonably
priced
domestic
bw
its
a
nice
beer
to
pick
up
12
ounce
bottle
overall
the
beer
is
okay
and
i
am
impressed
with
how
well
hidden
the
11
abv
is
but
it
is
not
very
deep
in
flavor
or
nose
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
if
you
just
wanted
to
get
drukn
on
23
bottles
all
in
all
a
drinkable
barleywine
but
nothing
thatll
leave
a
lasting
impression
it
does
leave
you
wanting
more
of
something
malt
or
hops
would
have
been
good
choices
unfortunately
thats
about
as
excited
as
i
can
get
over
this
beer
which
provides
easy
simple
malt
character
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
but
not
much
else
this
clear
ambercolored
bw
drinks
suspiciously
easy
for
the
abv
but
in
the
final
analysis
i
felt
that
it
simply
did
not
have
enough
flavor
for
my
tastebuds
to
explore
drinkability
and
overall
i
love
barleywines
i
love
clipper
city
mostly
this
one
just
didnt
work
out
next
i
hate
to
join
the
haters
but
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
either

with
more

popping

are
about
all
else
that
stick
out
body
was
sufficient
and
nothing
special
drinkability
wasnt
bad
as
in
it
went
down
easy
enough
the
lack
of
any
real
flavor
and
aroma
depth
will
keep
me
away
from
my
other
bottles
for
awhile
in
hopes
of
something
happening
with
them
not
a
bad
beer
but
about
as
average
as
it
gets
its
been
a
good
year
for
the
heavy
seas
line
first
a
very
good
imperial
pilsner
and
then
two
nice
ipas
their
peg
leg
imperial
stout
although
tasy
is
not
quite
up
to
the
style
had
it
been
labeled
an
imperial
brown
ale
i
think
it
would
have
been
very
well
received
which
brings
us
to
below
decks
which
is
getting
only
fair
to
poor
reviews
i
cant
quite
understand
why
this
is
a
very
pleasing
dark
brew
with
very
nice
vanilla
carmel
notes
and
is
amazing
drinkable
for
11
abv
its
also
a
good
deal
i
paid
7
50
for
a
4
pack
perhaps
it
should
have
been
labeled
a
strong
dark
ale
rather
than
a
barleywine
regardless
below
decks
is
quite
delicious
not
much
to
say
light
aroma
flavor
and
body
high
carbonation
would
never
guess
it
is
a
barleywine
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
abv
is
barely
noticeable
just
dont
expect
anything
aggressive
which
is
one
reason
to
drink
a
barleywine
one
year
of
aging
didnt
really
help
this
beer
i
preferred
it
fresh
beer
is
good
happy
small
barelywine
beering
overall
a
dissappointing
barleywine
plain
and
simple
this
is
not
a
pleasant
tasting
barleywine
the
flavors
are
bland
and
reminiscent
of
chemicals
one
to
avoid
and
made
to
walk
the
plank
a
clean
brown
beer
with
amber
highlights
has
a
good
creamy
off
white
head
very
light
aroma
some
malt
sweetness
hop
bitterness
and
a
disturbing
corn
note
in
the
background
no
real
distinct
flavors
again
some
malt
sweetness
a
light
hop
bite
on
the
finish
that
nagging
little
corn
note
in
the
back
and
the
alcohol
burn
maybe
it
will
blossom
next
year
but
it
doesnt
have
alot
to
work
with
amber
with
golden
highlights
but
minimal
head
and
carbonation
hoppy
and
vineous
to
the
nose
alchohol
takes
the
drivers
seat
on
the
tastebuds
a
bit
bland
overall
no
real
flavor
unfortunatly
fairly
easy
to
drink
apart
from
the
lack
of
taste
a
bit
light
and
thin
im
gonna
lay
a
bottle
or
two
done
for
a
few
months
to
see
if
age
improves
the
character
of
this
barleywine
i
will
rereview
the
beer
then
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
going
to
be
my
first
choice
in
barleywines
two
would
fill
you
up
not
to
mention
put
you
under
the
table
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
this
is
a
very
dark
clear
amber
with
a
surprisingly
thick
finger
of
head
decent
retention
and
some
pretty
nice
lacing
nose
is
very
muted
a
slightly
sweet
malt
some
spicey
hops
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
a
light
fruity
malt
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
slowly
giving
way
to
a
nice
piney
hops
presense
leaving
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
awash
slightly
with
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
fairly
smooth
slick
taste
alcohol
stays
fairly
well
hidden
never
more
than
just
a
hint
in
the
finish
i
find
most
barleywines
to
be
unbalancedamerican
ones
are
great
hopmonsters
while
english
ones
tend
to
be
very
sweet
to
the
point
of
cloying
this
is
a
very
wellbalanced
alternative
maybe
lacking
in
some
of
the
intensity
of
flavor
a
lot
of
barleywines
have
but
a
pretty
good
attempt
from
clipper
city
at
the
style
i
tried
it
both
cold
and
at
near
room
temperature
the
warmer
sample
had
a
much
spicier
and
complex
flavor
forgive
me
i
am
still
learning
to
match
words
with
what
i
taste
but
both
were
very
smooth
and
drinkable
you
dont
realize
the
amount
of
alcohol
that
is
there
i
havent
tried
it
out
of
the
bottle
yet
but
was
overall
very
happy
with
it
smooth
yet
average
mouthfeel
goes
down
quickly
and
easily
the
high
abv
is
extremely
well
hiddenthere
wasnt
any
overtly
boozy
flavor
or
any
mouth
warming
properties
the
run
of
the
mill
balanced
flavor
is
spot
on
for
an
english
barleywine
and
reminds
me
of
several
i
had
while
in
england
since
it
isnt
the
boozy
hopmonster
that
american
barleywines
are
i
found
it
to
be
highly
drinkable
drank
two
before
dinner
just
last
night
some
interesting
things
may
come
about
as
it
ages
too
i
guess
its
a
good
thing
that
this
beer
only
comes
in
a
4
pack
i
cant
imagine
anyone
would
want
more
than
that
the
apperance
is
pretty
nice
a
solid
depp
amber
with
a
whitish
head
but
no
lacing
and
the
head
leaves
the
party
very
fast
the
smell
is
muted
there
is
a
presence
of
piney
hops
and
alcohol
and
some
maltyness
but
everything
is
dulled
a
confused
brew
the
alcohol
shines
through
and
the
hops
give
a
decent
bite
but
the
malt
seems
too
lax
and
isnt
up
to
the
challenge
of
containing
the
alcohol
the
body
is
almost
noexsistant
too
watery
for
style
and
really
hurt
the
flavor
best
to
see
if
this
improves
any
i
will
see
another
bottle
in
a
few
months
high
abv
and
the
average
flavor
will
help
limit
me
at
one
just
an
average
barleywine
at
this
point
well
see
how
it
ages
and
my
opinion
may
change
this
beer
poured
a
clear
medium
amber
color
with
little
carbonation
present
it
formed
an
off
white
foamy
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malts
hops
caramel
and
slightly
burnt
butterscotch
aspect
to
it
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
woodpine
with
a
touch
of
caramel
the
body
was
a
bit
thinner
than
usual
for
style
and
the
finish
had
a
stlight
astrigent
yet
burnt
aspect
to
it
as
with
all
barleywines
this
one
may
just
be
young
and
improve
with
age
will
try
a
bottle
later
in
the
season
and
see
if
it
improves
not
too
harsh
for
a
barley
wine
overall
a
solid
bourbon
barrelaged
barleywine
that
impresses
by
the
quality
of
its
even
execution
rather
than
any
single
memorable
aspect
not
a
goto
like
insanity
is
but
definitely
worth
consideration
o
held
up
pretty
well
for
being
four
years
old
and
enjoyably
mellow
overall
a
little
disapointed
because
it
didnt
reach
the
heights
i
was
hoping
it
did
but
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
perhaps
i
need
another
one
to
lay
down
for
another
year
or
two
and
see
if
the
booze
mellows
a
bit
and
try
it
again

a

o
a

beer
with
great
depth
aged
for
about
a
year
and
it
seems
to
have
made
this
beer
great
o
overall
great
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
its
definitely
different
than
a
traditional
barleywine
but
for
a
bigger
heavier
beer
this
is
delightful
overall
a
decent
barleywine
but
one
that
lacks
the
complexity
of
other
versions
partly
because
its
bourbon
character
is
distractingly
high
there
are
many
tasty
flavors
present
but
most
of
them
are
too
sweet
creating
an
unbalanced
combination
not
a
bad
bourbon
aged
barleywine
has
a
really
nice
sweet
butterscotch
flavor
that
i
loved
a
bit
more
body
and
this
could
have
been
up
there
with
the
best
of

in

there
is
perhaps
a

much
sweetness
in
here

that
such
a

fits
with

and
the

do
get
very
strong

on

a
pop
i
am
convinced
this
is
the
best
bourbon
barrel
beer
ever
made
even
at
10
bucks
its
a
steal
overall
pretty
solid
for
sure
this
one
is
certainly
enjoyable
complex
and
very
well
balanced
with
a
good
blend
of
barrel
flavors
and
base
beer
a
thicker
heavier
feel
would
make
this
outstanding
still
its
very
nice
as
it
is
and
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
thanks
again
sliverx
recommended
a
very
good
barrel
aged
beer
one
of
heavy
seas
better
servings
definitely
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
underrated
i
was
unsure
of
it
when
i
purchased
it
but
after
i
had
it
i
got
a
few
more
for
my
cellar
anxious
to
see
how
it
ages
strong
vanilla
notes
a
wonderful
and
readily
available
barrel
aged
barley
wine
also
for
the
price
7
99
its
at
least
worth
a
try
o
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easy
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
little
bit
better
than
the
regular
version
but
not
enough
to
make
it
an
upper
echelon
barley
wine
overall
very
unique
i
can
see
this
being
nichelike
to
barreling
fans
but
i
like
the
uniqueness
in
flavor
this
would
cellar
well
provided
i
could
keep
it
in
storage
very
boozy
both
in
taste
and
in
fact
needs
to
mellow
out
for
a
little
while
in
the
glass
otherwise
the
first
several
sips
taste
like
a
jack
and
coke
starts
out
thin
but
develops
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
tasty
complex
and
warming
a
musttry
for
bourbon
fans
the
beer
started
off
really
well
but
towards
the
finish
it
felt
a
tad
thin
and
simple
for
a
ba
barleywine
its
enjoyable
though
mediumfull
body
moderate
carbonation
nice
warmth
an
excellent
bba
beer
i
do
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
profile
since
its
still
a
barley
wine
but
to
hell
with
it
o
solid
a
sweeter
barleywine
appropriate
for
the
english
moniker
this
is
no
sn
bigfoot
or
other
hopforward
american
barleywine
with
the
bourbon
adding
a
nice
flavor
to
the
overall
experience
thanks
to
my
brotherinlaw
for
bringing
this
one
north
from
baltimore
might
be
nice
to
hold
on
to
for
cellaring
enjoyable
barleywine
smells
sweet
like
a
barley
wine
but
also
has
the
bourbon
nose
nice
red
pour
with
a
small
white
head
that
doesnt
do
much
of
sticking
around
has
the
barley
wine
sweetness
without
any
hops
really
to
balance
it
which
is
strange
the
bourbon
is
thrown
on
top
not
sure
it
works
but
its
good
enough
this
is
another
delicious
version
of
the
below
decks
the
beer
is
fantastic
on
its
own
but
the
bourbon
adds
depth
and
mellows
the
alcohol
the
barrels
impart
not
only
bourbon
but
also
some
vanilla
notes
the
maltiness
of
the
beer
is
balanced
fruity
and
sugary
just
the
way
i
wanted
it
to
be
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
o
good
for
a
try
but
for
me
a
oneanddone
the
beer
showcases
malt
balance
in
vivid
display
with
little
rebuttal
from
hops
yeasty
fruit
or
spice
or
from
water
chemistries
the
beer
is
ripe
and
pungent
with
all
of
the
glory
of
english
hops
though
done
in
america
the
brewery
really
shows
great
command
of
the
style
still
for
the
price
very
nicely
done
an
american
treasure
in
development
keep
at
it
heavy
seas
youre
almost
there
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
it
just
all
came
together
just
the
way
it
should
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
with
hardly
any
alcohol
showing
up
in
the
taste
and
it
had
lots
of
flavors
that
held
my
attention
nicely
one
bomber
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
but
it
would
also
be
nice
to
share
with
someone
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
balanced
it
was
nothing
was
too
overpowering
and
the
flavors
went
really
well
with
each
other
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
i
cant
find
a
single
thing
wrong
with
it
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
next
time
it
is
released
and
i
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
another
bottle
to
throw
in
the
cellar
and
see
how
it
ages
it
was
worth
the
9
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
likes
barleywines
and
barrel
aged
beers
all
in
all
i
was
really
happy
with
this
beer
and
it
made
for
a
great
brew
to
celebrate
my
birthday
with
i
havent
had
the
best
of
luck
with
heavy
seas
but
all
the
bombers
i
have
tried
from
them
have
been
above
average
at
worst
im
liking
what
this
brewery
does
with
bigger
beers
good
job
guys
you
can
be
sure
i
will
be
trying
more
of
your
beers
and
i
would
love
to
try
the
original
below
decks
barleywine
nice
work
guys
drink
i
think
this
one
was
the
best
of
the
3
a
good
amount
of
vanilla
and
oak
and
a
good
malty
flavor
was
pretty
balanced
would
like
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
seeing
as
this
was
a
2011
overall
heavy
seas
keeps
knocking
their
barrel
aged
beers
out
of
the
park
give
this
one
a
go
or
set
it
down
for
a
few
years
would
easily
get
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
flavoring
and
the
thick
and
syrupy
feel
the
flavoring
started
a
bit
mild
but
once
it
came
to
temperature
all
of
the
notes
and
glorious
aromatics
within
blossomed
this
full
flavored
thickness
was
added
to
by
the
physical
stickiness
and
warmth
of
the
beer
and
the
abv
this
made
for
a
pleasant
feel
on
each
aspect
of
the
sip
and
followthrough
as
with
the
flavoring
the
aroma
was
also
a
bit
mild
in
the
beginning
this
improved
only
marginally
however
and
while
all
of
the
expected
notes
were
there
we
were
wishing
for
a
bit
more
pop
by
the
end
to
fully
round
this
guy
out
overall
nothing
particularly
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
lacks
the
overall
depth
and
power
i
would
expect
from
a
barrelaged
barleywine
the
lack
of
a
hop
presence
is
also
a
detractor
i
expected
this
to
be
a
little
more
assertive
than
it
was
it
wasnt
bad
it
just
wasnt
that
much
of
a
barleywine
edit
had
to
go
in
an
up
the
overall
a
bit
this
got
better
as
it
warmed
would
recommend
to
a
discerning
friend
if
it
sounds
good
to
you
worth
a
shot
not
over
retail
though
tried
this
on
cask
today
the
ginger
man
at
first
it
was
a
little
unrefined
but
tasty
probably
what
i
would
expect
considering
how
much
i
loved
the
2
year
old
version
as
i
drink
more
it
gets
better
and
this
beer
is
wonderful
fresh
but
it
could
still
use
some
age
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
on
cask
bourbonbarrel
aged
barlewines
are
a
style
i
have
really
developed
a
taste
for
over
the
past
12
months
i
dont
drink
them
very
often
but
i
just
cannot
pass
them
up
at
the
store
this
one
is
an
exceptional
value
at
only
8
99
per
bomber
its
no
king
henry
but
its
better
than
you
might
think
i
plan
to
pick
up
an
extra
bottle
or
two
for
the
cellar
to
see
how
it
ages
if
the
sweetness
develops
and
the
alcohol
dies
down
this
could
be
a
beautiful
beer
medium
full
body
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
sipper
while
a
bit
too
sweet
it
works
for
my
present
mood
to
note
i
dont
know
if
its
just
me
but
the
barrel
aging
process
that
heavy
seas
uses
seems
to
not
be
the
best
its
always
overly
sweet
with
a
very
nutty
overtone
and
not
much
for
a
bourbon
taste
i
remember
having
their
octoberfest
or
one
of
their
fall
beers
and
it
was
almost
indistinguishable
from
this
beer
just
something
the
take
caution
about
o
good
flavors
not
too
hot
good
finish
good
beer
im
really
enjoying
this
one
medium
body
soft
carbonation
warming
alcohol
present
very
nice
that
the
barrel
does
not
overwhelm
this
beer
but
i
feel
like
there
is
something
missing
in
the
middle
still
a
good
beer
for
a
very
reasonable
price
cost
7
99
d
pretty
good
english
style
barleywine
here
however
personally
i
did
not
detect
as
much
bourbon
as
i
expected
lots
of
sweet
malt
almost
overpowers
any
and
all
bourbon
oak
vanilla
notes
unfortunately
i
do
not
remember
the
vintage
the
brewer
brought
to
this
tasting
but
i
am
going
to
guess
it
has
been
out
of
the
barrel
for
a
little
bit
of
time
otherwise
a
very
solid
english
barley
o
this
was
tasty
but
22oz
was
too
much
i
would
probably
pass
on
it
again
but
well
see
how
it
does
with
age
still
for
7
50
a
bottle
you
cant
really
go
wrong
here
o
a
simply
good
beer
but
for
the
price
i
can
do
a
lot
better
many
other
ways
i
still
recommend
id
love
to
try
the
cabernet
version
deuce
to
tulip
2010
vintage
looks
good
deep
amber
with
very
thin
lacing
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
pretty
underwhelming
actually
tastes
good
nothing
too
complex
but
a
nice
journeymans
attempt
at
a
ba
barleywine
mouthfeel
is
good
little
carbonation
its
a
tasty
brew
and
a
good
value
for
the
price
o
the
barleywine
does
get
overpowered
a
bit
by
the
alcohol
but
it
is
a
nice
mixture
of
both
o
very
subdued
bourbon
treatment
on
this
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
for
a
barleywine
but
still
tasty
doesnt
taste
boozy
but
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
sneaking
up
on
me
overall
wished
there
was
more
bourbon
in
both
the
nose
and
flavor
overall
there
is
obviously
a
good
reason
people
are
requesting
ba
beers
this
is
a
grandslam
heavy
seas
they
also
make
this
beer
nonbarrelaged
i
recommend
getting
both
and
doing
a
vertical
o
overall
i
preferred
this
one
to
the
cabernet
version
but
im
not
convinced
either
improves
form
aging
both
are
good
beers
with
the
cabernet
verions
being
much
sweeter
and
this
version
havnig
more
bourbon
as
expected
so
i
guess
it
just
really
depends
on
what
you
like
in
a
barleywine
either
way
id
suggest
drinking
them
relatively
fresh
as
i
think
they
both
faded
already
in
a
year
everything
i
ever
wanted
in
a
bourbonbarrel
barleywine
and
it
turned
out
to
be
magnificent
fresh
notes
wow
what
a
steal
at
5
99
a
bomber
who
ever
heard
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
at
this
price
point
especially
one
of
this
quality
i
will
be
stocking
my
cellar
with
this
a
diamond
in
the
rough
for
sure
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
vanilla
oaky
and
bourbon
in
the
taste
oaky
bourbon
vanilla
sweetness
and
a
dry
alcohol
presence
an
alcohol
like
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
alcohol
and
bourbon
like
aftertaste
big
bourbon
presence
sweet
oak
and
vanilla
for
a
balance
overall
pretty
solid
but
also
real
easy
drinking
too
surprisingly
not
much
barrel
aging
bourbon
character
here
but
no
complaints
a
nice
beer
but
to
be
honest
if
this
was
more
than
10
the
cost
of
the
original
i
would
likely
pass
it
up
for
the
original
pretty
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
some
subtle
flavors
in
here
that
make
for
a
complex
beer
that
works
pretty
well
pours
a
thin
rust
color
with
an
average
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smells
boozy
oaky
bourbony
wplenty
of
sweet
malt
adding
to
the
nose
first
sip
is
super
malt
sweetness
layered
in
a
ton
of
oak
there
is
bourbon
in
there
too
but
the
oak
unfortunately
is
much
more
dominating
the
sweetness
that
hits
first
fades
rather
quickly
leading
to
a
bitter
finish
highlighted
almost
entirely
by
the
mighty
oak
though
very
thin
bodied
there
is
just
enough
carbonation
to
warrant
a
decent
mouthfeel
the
10
abv
is
not
well
hidden
at
all
it
is
in
your
face
making
one
to
think
it
is
stronger
than
it
really
is
o
not
as
good
as
i
expected
but
still
worth
the
money
i
paid
for
it
i
generally
enjoy
all
of
heavy
seas
mutiny
fleet
productions
but
this
is
a
qualified
exception
i
guess
it
didnt
age
well
i
will
withhold
any
recommendation
positive
or
negative
i
wont
buy
another
it
even
if
i
ever
see
one
overall
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
look
forward
to
comparing
it
to
the
red
wine
version
that
i
have
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
is
low
overall
it
was
a
delicious
beer
the
bourbon
and
the
sweet
maltiness
of
the
barleywine
were
integrated
and
balanced
almost
to
perfection
the
bourbon
especially
really
stood
out
to
me
the
barleywine
flavors
were
very
good
but
seemed
a
little
overshadowed
by
the
bourbon
at
times
excellent
beer
overall
though
and
an
extremely
enjoyable
one
to
sip
on
this
evening
loved
the
flavor
on
this
but
other
areas
fell
flat
for
the
money
ill
take
schlaflys
barrel
aged
bw
at
a
fraction
of
the
price
any
day
still
i
was
thrilled
to
try
it
poured
into
an
imperial
nonic
a
deep
rich
amber
with
a
thinner
but
well
formed
off
white
head
atop
aromas
of
deep
vaniilaand
caramel
eally
stand
outthe
vanilla
tinged
oak
is
a
bit
heavy
handed
in
my
opinion
somewhat
boozy
and
very
oaky
on
the
palatevanilla
and
caramel
flavors
add
more
sweetnessit
is
very
smooth
going
down
though
another
barrel
aged
beer
that
gets
a
little
to
much
of
the
aged
flavorsits
not
bad
but
it
could
be
better
with
less
aged
flavors
o
a
good
ba
barleywine
vanilla
and
oak
are
quite
pronounced
possibly
more
so
than
unsual
because
the
underlying
beer
seems
a
little
thin
i
imagine
this
one
has
some
age
on
it
as
seems
to
be
quite
mellow

very
good
beer
i
rarely
say
this
but
perhaps
too
heavy
on
the
bourbon
i
really
enjoyed
the
base
beer
would
have
liked
to
see
more
of
it
shining
through
the
veil
of
the
barrel
but
alas
it
wasnt
to
be
still
very
enjoyable
overall
for
7
99
a
22oz
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywine
i
cant
for
the
life
of
me
remember
where
this
one
came
from
in
fact
i
initially
thought
it
was
a
different
vintage
of
greater
pumpkin
that
said
i
loved
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
little
light
brown
head
aromas
of
bourbon
oak
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
on
the
palate
this
one
was
medium
to
full
bodied
with
bourbon
brown
sugar
oak
and
booze
very
good
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
it
is
sweet
and
easy
drinking
for
the
most
part
the
oxidation
quality
gives
it
some
depth
overall
its
not
a
bad
offering
the
10
abv
is
hidden
quite
well
at
less
than
8
a
bomber
this
is
worth
having
again
in
my
humble
opinion
the
mutiny
series
ales
from
clipper
city
has
more
misses
than
hits
the
latter
includes
the
great
pumpkin
hang
ten
letter
of
marque
2010
and
bourbon
barrel
aged
below
decks
7
99
is
a
more
than
reasonable
asking
price
considering
how
much
enjoyment
im
getting
out
of
the
bomber
mmmm
pretty
tasty
this
along
with
the
cabernet
version
might
be
my
favorite
so
far
from
the
mutiny
fleet
bourbon
and
oak
flavors
are
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
beer
not
too
overpowering
but
notable
enough
abv
is
well
hidden
goes
down
smooth
gets
a
bit
thin
and
surprisingly
mild
as
the
ounces
pass
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
d
just
not
a
wower
fun
to
try
d
its
been
awhile
but
i
seem
to
recall
liking
the
regular
version
better
than
either
barrel
aged
version
i
did
enjoy
this
but
stronger
barleywine
elements
would
have
been
welcome
courtesy
of
markwise
over
on
ratebeer
it
pours
clear
mahogany
with
tan
head
the
aroma
starts
with
sweet
bourbon
and
then
moving
toward
mildly
harsh
boozy
bourbon
as
well
as
prunes
figs
raisins
molasses
and
some
heat
at
the
end
of
the
draw
the
taste
is
smooth
sweet
inviting
molasses
caramel
vanilla
sweet
bourbon
spicy
oak
raisins
figs
and
a
thin
strata
of
dates
yummy
id
recommend
aging
this
one
for
a
couple
of
years
to
restore
balance
the
alcohol
bite
should
retreat
and
some
of
the
sweet
malt
should
develop
to
give
this
beer
a
more
rounded
and
complex
flavor
profile
d
quite
easy
for
the
style
the
wood
may
put
some
off
i
would
have
another
another
decent
bw
but
again
a
heavy
seas
light
bw
that
couldnt
hold
up
and
took
on
all
the
character
of
the
barrel
if
you
like
bourbon
its
worth
drinking
otherwise
skip
it
a
hefty
powerful
barleywine
while
not
overwhelmed
by
barrel
notes
it
certainly
doesnt
seek
to
balance
them
d
this
had
an
amazing
scent
with
very
nice
taste
and
body
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
bad
so
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
could
probably
improve
with
age
but
fresh
is
already
much
better
than
the
standard
below
decks
or
the
cabernet
barrel
version
perhaps
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
heavy
seas
d
good
drinkability
while
cold
decently
balanced
but
the
flavors
just
keep
getting
stronger
in
a
notsogoodway
as
it
warms
poured
into
a
tulip
appearance
is
a
nice
mahogany
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
tad
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
straight
bourbon
a
bit
of
light
caramel
and
fruit
in
the
background
the
booze
goes
with
the
bourbon
taste
is
predominantly
bourbon
again
but
done
quite
well
really
nice
feel
with
booze
and
bourbon
plus
a
slight
sweetness
underneath
much
better
than
the
original
though
not
quite
as
interesting
as
the
cabernet
version
flavor
is
very
good
but
not
great
creamy
mouthfeel
decent
amount
of
booze
medium
carbonation
the
bourbon
addition
is
a
stellar
addition
to
the
below
decks
barleywine
beer
some
hops
fruits
charcoal
possibly
some
toffee
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
think
i
liked
the
wine
aged
below
decks
better
but
this
was
definitely
delicious
the
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
mix
of
burnt
toffee
and
bourbon
its
warm
and
inviting
with
a
tremendous
wood
character
the
taste
is
damn
good
as
well
it
has
a
warm
burnt
toffee
flavor
rich
and
boozy
with
tons
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
adds
a
good
deal
of
vanilla
character
as
well
as
a
fine
bourbon
flair
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
well
brewed
beer
that
has
only
improved
with
the
barrel
aging
this
was
sampled
alongside
the
cabernet
barrelaged
version
and
i
thought
this
was
the
superior
beer
md
it
is
very
smooth
and
easily
drinakable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
barleywine
i
bet
it
would
be
even
better
a
year
from
now
i
just
couldnt
wait
that
long
bourbon
barrel
below
decks
is
good
beer
ive
enjoyed
the
bomber
and
dont
have
much
to
complain
about
at
all
it
would
benefit
from
a
little
more
body
and
just
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
presence
but
its
good
stuff
as
it
is
i
like
the
approach
with
the
barrel
aging
i
have
no
idea
how
long
it
was
in
barrels
but
it
was
the
perfect
time
theres
just
enough
bourbon
vanilla
and
oak
to
make
things
really
click
easily
recommended
my
fears
this
might
be
an
american
barleywine
were
allayed
i
suppose
but
it
doesnt
exactly
inspire
thoughts
of
an
english
barleywine
either
no
heat
which
is
a
bit
odd
i
actually
might
like
a
bit
more
heat
deceptively
easy
to
drink
wish
it
were
more
flavorful
drinkability
moderate
at
best
due
to
the
big
abv
and
bit
of
a
heavy
weight
after
a
while
great
flavors
though
and
this
would
definitely
be
a
beer
to
share
cant
wait
to
try
this
one
with
a
year
or
so
on
it
best
thing
ive
had
from
these
guys
in
a
while
maybe
ever
ahhh
there
we
go
taste
is
very
nice
much
more
fruity
qualities
come
out
red
currant
cherry
date
fig
caramel
toffee
vanilla
woodsy
notes
with
some
bourbon
on
the
finish
slight
wood
tannins
as
well
very
nice
light
bodies
barley
wine
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
bourbonbarrelaged
beer
for
a
relatively
low
price
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
a
nice
one
to
sip
on
one
of
the
better
bourbon
barrel
aged
barleywines
ive
had
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
one
of
these
up
again
if
i
can
find
it
d
a
rather
bland
effort
for
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
i
would
not
really
bother
with
this
one
d
a
very
smooth
example
of
the
style
the
bourbon
is
complementary
which
is
a
nice
change
after
recently
having
a
number
of
bourboncentric
brews
ok
so
its
a
huge
beer
not
the
most
drinkable
but
its
wonderful
and
i
would
buy
again
on
sight
great
beer
from
heavy
seas
the
cab
barrel
was
more
innovative
but
this
is
just
as
good
nice
one
dark
brown
with
nice
sudsy
head
warm
aroma
of
bourbon
wood
butter
cake
caramel
and
grain
tastes
smooth
with
warm
bourbon
grains
and
butterscotch
bourbon
is
rich
and
complex
without
being
boozy
barleywine
is
cut
mellowed
and
mild
by
the
aging
strong
on
butter
plus
a
strain
of
vanilla
unique
only
to
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
on
the
verge
of
infection
or
souring
but
still
in
their
excellent
stages
drinks
smoothly
with
a
fuller
medium
body
that
feels
a
bit
lighter
abv
prohibits
large
quantity
drinking
but
drinks
nicely
with
some
different
character
than
most
bourbon
aged
beers
di
really
enjoy
this
the
malty
sweetness
has
a
nice
amount
of
depth
and
the
barrel
aging
adds
a
nice
balance
to
it
the
bourbon
lingers
in
the
back
with
notes
of
fusel
alcohol
that
detract
slightly
but
still
well
done
drinkability
it
is
sooo
easy
to
drink
multiples
of
this
great
brew

d
all

a
try
4

after
a
very
pleasant
experience
with
the
carbernetaged
version
i
felt
compelled
to
give
this
one
a
try
even
more
than
before
it
pours
a
translucent
rubybrown
heavy
on
the
brown
with
a
pathetic
amount
of
large
bubbles
standing
in
for
what
would
otherwise
be
considered
a
head
the
nose
is
subtle
bourbon
oak
quadlike
yeast
molasses
vanilla
and
citrus
hops
it
all
melds
together
very
nicely
the
bourbon
begins
very
subtlely
in
the
taste
while
molassesdipped
citrus
hops
take
the
point
immediately
backedup
by
citrus
peel
the
sweeter
elements
make
up
the
next
wave
including
more
molasses
maple
syrup
and
some
oak
lighter
malty
elements
begin
the
final
flavor
stripe
joined
by
more
oak
drier
this
time
and
the
bourbon
its
all
pretty
tasty
but
the
striations
are
for
me
far
too
clear
the
body
is
fairly
hefty
with
lightly
moderate
carbonation
and
only
a
slight
coating
effect
a
very
nice
brew
overall
but
i
prefer
caberneted
version
better
d
boozy
for
sure
lots
of
bourbon
here
if
you
love
bourbon
this
beer
will
suit
you
just
fine
notes
this
is
a
brew
well
made
without
being
extraordinary
it
covers
all
the
essential
expectations
of
a
quality
bourbon
barred
aged
barleywine
in
fact
it
is
quite
a
pleasing
surprise
since
it
improves
right
away
the
perceived
roughness
of
a
fresh
regular
below
decks
beyond
the
expectations
of
what
was
too
harsh
a
barleywine
while
there
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
edginess
it
is
fairly
well
integrated
with
the
overall
brew
and
does
not
give
it
a
too
strong
offkey
note
not
entirely
sure
what
to
think
about
of
this
beer
the
cask
conditioning
and
barrel
aging
improve
the
beer
imho
but
its
still
not
entirely
my
cup
of
tea
in
a
barleywine
even
with
the
barrel
aging
the
beer
still
shows
some
alcohol
and
heat
in
the
finish
nevertheless
this
is
still
a
pretty
nice
beer
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
orange
red
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
smells
of
berries
slight
grape
and
sweet
light
grain
tastes
of
berries
molasses
and
slight
alcohol
beer
is
full
bodied
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
poured
a
beautiful
cloudy
ruddybrown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
burns
off
almost
immediately
the
aroma
is
pretty
mild
with
hints
of
hops
and
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
little
more
robust
with
some
nice
dark
fruit
notes
the
body
has
a
nice
fullness
on
the
palate
and
a
smooth
finish
im
forced
to
review
this
after
having
poured
a
glass
with
a
flat
headi
think
i
got
unlucky
and
got
one
that
had
just
lost
some
of
its
carbonation
or
something
that
said
it
still
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
and
tastes
wonderful
its
kind
of
nutty
and
simultaneously
smooth
and
robust
fantastic
beer
o
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
not
a
barleywine
its
a
hoppy
imperial
red
ale
if
it
was
labelled
as
such
i
mightve
scored
it
higher
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
barleywine
lots
of
good
bready
malty
flavors
melded
with
lots
of
toffee
dried
stone
fruit
candied
sugar
and
nicely
balanced
hoppy
bitterness
very
very
tasty
overall
bottle
says
best
before
2013
not
sure
how
far
out
they
date
their
bottles
this
one
seems
like
a
little
past
its
prime
some
odd
metallicmedicinal
flavour
and
a
little
oxidized
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
poured
a
reddish
brown
body
with
some
decent
head
and
lace
retention
aroma
is
a
little
boozy
but
nothing
bad
and
there
is
both
some
dark
fruit
and
sweet
malts
coming
through
beer
is
medium
bodied
smoth
not
only
a
touch
of
dark
fruits
im
thinking
figs
there
is
a
caramel
and
toffee
even
almost
candi
sugar
sweetness
that
pokes
through
at
times
the
alcohol
holds
things
in
balance
from
being
too
sweet
and
there
is
a
good
malt
base
that
keeps
it
held
together
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
barleywine
verdict
an
unfortunate
disaster
overly
simple
but
not
refined
in
any
way
too
bitter
too
astringent
and
just
unpleasant
perhaps
the
high
levels
of
carbonation
are
a
sign
of
slight
infection
i
cant
quite
say
the
flavors
dont
appear
to
be
off
other
than
they
just
arent
that
good
pours
a
ruby
red
with
a
soapy
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lace
aroma
of
booze
soaked
fruit
and
rich
malts
in
the
taste
caramel
toffee
nuts
raw
chocolate
and
citrus
full
bodied
very
flavorful
beer
overall
this
was
a
good
barleywine
big
fruit
and
sugar
little
hint
of
alcohol
id
love
to
age
a
bottle
of
this
o
where
did
this
come
from
all
i
know
about
duckrabbit
is
that
they
only
brew
dark
beers
and
that
they
struggle
with
infection
problems
this
thankfully
isnt
infected
just
damn
tasty
one
of
the
better
nonbarreled
barleywines
ive
had
in
a
while
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
reasonably
priced
barleywine
if
you
like
barleywines
with
a
dark
fruit
flavour
id
recommend
this
overall
not
too
bad
but
a
little
messy
at
the
end
of
the
taste
as
the
bitter
and
sweet
sorta
collide
with
the
booziness
leaving
a
slightly
off
flavor
in
the
mouth
not
one
i
would
necessarily
frequent
overall
a
very
interesting
barleywine
so
many
characteristics
and
still
a
tasty
beer
o
a
pretty
simple
barleywine
but
i
really
liked
the
toasted
bread
notes
they
really
come
through
strong
and
sharp
tastes
like
youre
drinking
alcoholic
liquid
bread
the
raisin
is
just
enough
to
add
another
layer
in
with
some
raisin
bread
quality
surprisingly
tasty
overall
a
very
nice
barleywine
decent
complexity
and
i
like
the
hopforward
profile
if
it
was
distributed
around
here
i
would
have
a
few
more
in
the
cellar
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
trade
for
it
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
amount
of
oily
and
boozy
touch
warmth
from
alcohol
is
somewhat
strong
low
to
moderate
carbonation
big
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
sample
overall
aged
amazingly
well
though
the
tartness
at
the
end
gets
lengthy
after
a
while
approaching
cough
syrup
like
flavor
at
times
overall
a
successful
aging
experiment
in
my
book
o
pretty
decent
liked
the
fruity
character
i
love
the
body
of
most
barleywines
but
this
one
was
a
little
thin
for
me
theres
a
lot
of
confused
malty
character
that
has
potential
could
be
developed
with
aging
overall

excellent

complex

the

abv
is
completely
invisible
in
the
hazy
swirl
of
hops
malt
and
yummy
goodness
the
dryhopping
was
stroke
of
genius
as
was
the
added
level
of
co2
excellent
beer
o
compared
to
weyerbacher
insanity
which
i
recently
reviewed
this
beer
looked
way
better
beautiful
to
behold
the
nose
was
comparable
but
i
didnt
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
quite
as
much
as
the
weyerbacher
really
good
english
barleywine
but
i
think
i
like
the
weyerbacher
better
overall
i
very
solid
english
barleywine
i
do
wish
this
one
was
available
here
in
utah
drinkable
barleywine
with
a
signature
all
its
own
spicy
fruity
sweet
and
sherried
delightful
m
very
full
mouthfeel
very
very
drinkable
incredible
rich
and
moreish
i
enjoyed
this
beer
when
i
tasted
it
at
the
acbf
lighter
carbonation
complex
but
not
overwhelming
taste
it
was
pleasant
to
sip
on
while
the
flavors
sorted
themselves
out
all
in
all
an
interesting
beer
one
of
my
fonder
memories
from
that
somewhat
blurry
night
duck
rabbit
barleywine
ale
pours
a
color
thats
something
between
amber
and
mahogany
with
no
visibility
through
the
glass
possible
maybe
two
fingers
of
cream
colored
foam
top
the
beer
and
hang
around
for
just
a
bit
before
fading
lacing
is
spotty
the
nose
features
aromas
of
caramel
fig
and
alcohol
theres
also
a
background
fruitiness
thats
just
odd
and
a
little
out
of
place
the
flavor
opens
with
a
healthy
swirl
of
caramel
just
as
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
is
coming
into
the
picture
what
certainly
tastes
like
an
infection
comes
into
the
picture
theres
a
slight
medicinal
twang
to
it
and
a
lime
fruitiness
that
just
clashes
with
everything
that
came
before
it
the
infection
hasnt
impacted
the
mouthfeel
too
badly
yet
the
body
is
a
little
bit
lighter
than
it
should
be
but
the
carbonation
isnt
too
active
yet
ive
had
other
vintages
of
duck
rabbits
barleywine
that
were
pretty
nice
but
something
definitely
went
wrong
with
at
least
part
of
this
batch
pours
like
a
barleywine
muddy
amber
brown
with
a
quickly
fading
light
tan
head
smells
like
cherry
leather
sherry
gently
smoked
fine
meats
cardboard
and
bread
slightly
oxidized
as
expected
but
ill
be
damned
it
doesnt
taste
awful
chewy
and
leathery
body
with
delicate
and
thoughtful
carbonation
less
fruity
than
the
nose
more
malt
forward
and
proper
british
hell
of
a
lot
more
enjoyable
than
the
2008
dr
baltic

i
threw
out

but
seriously
what
jerkoff
ages
duck

beers
othis
one
didnt
age
as
well

i
had
hoped
the
pleasant
complex
sweetness
that
seemed
to
develop
over
time
was
overwhelmed
by
the
strong
alcohol
aftertaste
if
that
could
be
masked
some
how
this
would
be
an
excellent
ager
i
am
intrigued
yet
put
off
after
the
first
12
it
becomes
astringently
sourmust
be
some
sort
of
infection
unless
they
add
an
odd
fruit
they
do
not
disclose
overall
this
is
clearly
not
what
others
have
tasted
something
is
wrong
and
i
hate
that
this
is
my
first
review
for
these
guys
ive
had
some
of
their
other
beers
in
the
past
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
them
just
a
shame
they
let
this
slip
out
appearance
was
normal
everything
else
was
not
horribly
infected
taste
awful
deserves
a
zero
dont
have
much
experience
with
duck
rabbit
but
the
two
beers
that
i
was
sent
as
extras
were
both
infected
this
does
not
make
me
want
to
really
give
their
beers
another
try
seeing
as
they
have
such
poor
quality
control
standards
o
the
bottle
should
read
enjoy
by
never
this
wasnt
a
terrible
infection
but
it
was
definitely
present
there
was
some
rays
of
hope
in
the
nose
with
some
of
the
intended
flavors
of
the
beer
but
the
flavor
profile
was
downright
bad
in
the
taste
cannot
recommend
overall
dont
know
what
the
problem
was
but
if
it
werent
for
the
nose
and
finish
of
sourness
this
would
have
been
an
interesting
and
well
balance
barleywine
bummer
o
very
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
stronger
beer
to
drink
for
as
long
as
you
can
handle
it
very
unique
for
a
barley
wine
alcohol
is
not
apparent
at
all
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
sipper
though
citrusy
grapefruity
hoppy
and
a
tad
sweet
citrus
flavor
is
quite
intense
very
unique
and
another
quality
offering
from
the
duck
rabbit
thanks
crunkchiggin2002
for
extraing
me
this
one
big
boozy
piney
with
a
bit
of
sour
cherry
and
strong
malt
backbone
appearance
is
a
slight
red
color
with
not
much
head
retention
or
lacing
aroma
is
pie
cherry
bready
with
citrus
notes
taste
is
of
strong
malt
backbone
but
not
sweet
generally
dry
perhaps
a
bit
overattenuated
with
wonderful
sour
cherry
notes
that
go
well
with
the
malt
and
surprisingly
well
with
the
piney
citrus
hops
infected
no
metallic
certainly
not
sour
a
bit
but
very
interesting
in
the
style
and
very
enjoyable
i
would
say
that
the
malt
and
hops
carry
through
to
make
this
a
true
barleywine
but
the
sour
edge
gives
it
a
unique
twist
overall
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
hides
the
alcohol
well
but
this
one
is
strange
and
may
be
infected
especially
considering
the
recent
reviews
describing
this
though
i
suspected
it
before
reading
those
reviews
d
weird
this
almost
seems
like
a
sour
with
the
level
of
acidity
and
the
odd
yeasty
notes
im
really
conflicted
about
whether
this
is
infected
or
not
it
has
some
really
strange
characteristics
and
it
is
oddly
dry
for
an
english
barleywine
the
smoky
character
is
really
odd
for
the
style
and
almost
to
the
level
that
it
would
be
unpleasant
not
something
that
i
would
drink
again
except
to
confirm
that
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
this
ill
be
honest
though
i
dont
find
this
beer
utterly
undrinkable
after
the
initial
shock
one
could
muscle
through
it
if
one
was
so
inclined
to
look
for
its
alcohol
effect
but
sadly
ill
be
drainpouring
this
bottle
in
search
of
something
else
poured
out
promisingly
enough
with
a
garnet
color
and
decent
head
classic
barleywine
aromas
of
raisin
honey
and
cherry
although
this
was
a
bit
cold
to
really
get
a
good
sense
of
it
unfortunately
all
changed
when
i
tasted
it
and
got
a
mouthful
of
one
of
the
foulest
metallic
brews
i
have
ever
encountered
completely
undrinkable
gave
it
30
minutes
to
see
if
warming
up
would
help
at
all
and
regretted
going
back
for
another
sip
drain
poured
the
rest
the
beer
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
piney
hops
in
it
as
well
as
some
heavy
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
there
is
also
some
alcohol
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
similar
there
are
some
pine
and
orange
notes
in
the
flavor
which
go
well
with
the
heavy
caramel
malt
backbone
there
is
also
some
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
thanks
redliner8
o
wow
incredibly
disappointed
this
is
clearly
infected
if
this
is
the
brewers
intention
i
have
to
say
that
i
hate
this
brett
and
tartness
in
a
barleywine
just
dont
work
for
me

is
very
much
like
an

which
could
fool
you
if
you
didnt
know
which
beer
was
in

of
you
but
how
often
does
that
happen
definitely
much
more
full
budied
than
old
horizontal
or
the
appalachian
brewing
co
barleywine
ive
had
those
are
the
only
other
two
ive
tried
definitely
a
sipper
but
also
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
style
a
nice
6ounce
glass
or
a
whole
12ounce
bottle
if
youre
me
make
for
a
perfect
aperitif
before
fish
or
chicken
the
sourness
of
this
one
really
threw
me
off
also
very
lightweight
for
a
barley
doesnt
taste
like
11
but
you
can
feel
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
ive
had
much
better
barleys
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
sour
this
is
a
very
good
brew
i
admit
was
surprised
at
the
smoothness
and
drinkability
having
expected
more
of
bite
but
found
none
the
aroma
had
hints
of
caramel
citrus
and
even
cinnamon
and
molasses
it
was
very
drinkable
not
overwhelming
in
the
least
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
and
none
the
heavier
beer
note
at
all
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beverage
one
for
my
favorites
list
drink
a
very
tasty
beer
has
a
large
flavor
profile
complex
tasty
and
sweet
classic
bw
flavors
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
overall
ive
never
had
a
barleywine
that
tasted
like
this
its
real
impressive
but
perhaps
not
one
i
would
go
nuts
over
great
beer
o
highly
recommended
im
not
incredibly
familiar
with
the
style
and
thus
cant
speak
to
how
well
this
brew
adheres
to
its
tenets
but
i
know
a
good
beer
when
i
taste
one
i
love
the
duck
rabbits
offerings
and
this
is
my
favorite
beer
of
theirs
this
could
become
my
new
goto
good
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
its
a
sipper
but
its
highly
drinkable
its
balanced
hoppy
and
a
little
sweet
i
think
a
little
age
would
mellow
it
out
more
but
its
good
as
is
the
citrus
quality
is
intense
and
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
i
liked
it
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
dirty
cloudy
copper
with
a
one
finger
soapy
off
white
head
the
nose
is
surprisingly
oaky
and
dry
the
matinees
is
sweet
with
sme
cherry
and
toffee
the
flavors
too
are
pretty
woody
especially
for
a
beer
that
isnt
advertised
to
be
barrel
aged
otherwise
it
follows
the
nose
with
candied
sugar
and
cherry
it
drinks
between
light
and
medium
in
body
and
isnt
overly
sticky
it
finishes
dry
fr
the
style
if
anything
this
is
an
interesting
barley
wine
its
worth
a
try
and
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
the
style
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
really
good
well
balanced
and
well
blended
full
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
level
slight
warmth
from
the
alcohol
almost
a
burn
to
the
point
where
its
slightly
hotter
than
you
want
it
to
be
but
makes
it
a
nice
sipper
all
in
all
a
nice
barleywine
very
tasty
picked
this
beer
up
at
a
local
restaurantbar
that
was
having
a
vintage
beer
sale
not
sure
when
this
beer
was
produced
but
the
drink
by
date
was
feb
2012
drank
on
jan
27
2012
i
would
have
expected
a
barleywine
like
this
one
to
have
aged
better
decent
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
o
this
is
about
on
par
for
the
correct
style
huge
hop
presence
makes
this
kinda
hard
to
drink
though
c
doesnt
particularly
offend
but
nothing
here
to
make
me
revisit
this
when
theres
so
many
better
options
out
there
overall
its
really
good
i
like
my
barleywines
malty
and
this
is
a
good
one
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
i
enjoyed
it
above
average
beer
but
not
mind
blowing
a
solid
english
barleywine
that
i
feel
is
a
bit
above
average
o
this
is
decent
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
found
it
all
right
o
im
pretty
amazed
actually
i
wish
i
knew
when
this
was
brewed
rather
than
when
its
best
by
cause
id
say
this
sucker
is
perfectly
aged
not
that
duck
rabbit
makes
bad
or
even
averagebeers
but
this
was
surprisingly
good
might
have
to
go
drink
the
other
one
i
bought
right
after
this
one
thick
sweet
but
not
overly
so
complex
challenging
and
oh
so
tasty
one
of
duck
rabbits
best
regulars
o
nice
beer
flavor
a
little
off
would
like
a
little
thinner
in
the
body
do
drinkability
is
moderate
this
is
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
barleywine
spectrum
but
the
taste
does
counteract
this
a
bit
with
the
hops
the
biggest
grievance
i
have
against
this
beer
is
the
somewhat
hot
alcohol
burn
in
the
flavor
while
bold
the
rest
of
the
flavors
have
a
tough
time
compensating
for
this
some
flaws
but
overall
this
is
a
worthwhile
barleywine
would
love
to
try
it
on
draft
if
you
like
barleywines
check
it
out
otherwise
its
probably
a
5050
chance
you
dig
it
or
dont
o
it
is
a
good
one
to
sip
over
a
long
period
of
time
but
it
is
just
warming
enough
to
not
be
an
everyday
barleywine
if
there
is
such
a
thing
o
its
not
horrible
beer
but
the
taste
is
a
letdown
from
what
is
a
pretty
good
smelling
beer
the
heat
isnt
helping
but
this
isnt
horrible
what
can
i
say
a
very
nice
barleywine
sweet
fruity
and
potent
with
nice
dimension
of
flavor
nothing
mindblowing
but
im
okay
with
that
i
dont
find
it
boozy
at
all
in
fact
if
i
hadnt
looked
at
the
label
first
id
be
quite
surprised
its
as
strong
as
it
is
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
barleywine
however
i
think
this
was
still
pretty
dang
hot
and
boozy
i
could
see
this
really
coming
into
its
own
in
a
couple
of
years
recommended
now
and
i
am
sure
10
years
from
now
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
with
chewy
malt
throughout
definitely
a
warming
sipper
of
a
barleywine
that
leaves
a
bit
of
a
heat
trail
as
it
goes
down
glad
to
have
tried
it
would
be
great
on
a
cold
night
maybe
even
with
a
nice
cigar
a
decent
showing
definitely
be
better
to
have
on
a
cold
night
instead
of
this
relatively
warm
one
i
like
my
barleywines
with
a
little
more
fruit
presence
but
this
is
still
enjoyable
a
nice
extra
but
wouldnt
trade
for
it
o
pretty
decent
in
a
barleywine
i
really
like
the
unfiltered
look
the
flavors
were
strong
but
not
standout
great
to
be
introduced
to
barleywines
with
this
o
the
flavour
has
an
unpleasant
kick
in
the
tail
3
5
o
super
light
feeling
drinkability
is
insane
o
pretty
good
barleywine
i
wouldnt
search
it
out
again
but
have
wanted
to
try
it
o
im
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
its
held
up
surprisingly
well
for
its
age
im
kinda
wishing
i
bought
more
to
see
what
further
aging
could
do
o
this
was
a
nice
drinking
barleywine
nothing
over
the
top
but
a
nice
sipping
beer
on
long
winter
nights
the
abv
is
a
little
on
the
high
side
and
it
shows
up
a
lot
but
adds
a
light
secondary
flavor
overall
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
these
bottles
thick
syrupy
and
smooth
nicely
balanced
and
tasty
this
barley
win
pours
out
as
a
murky
looking
brown
color
the
head
is
an
off
white
color
and
leaves
a
pretty
good
lacing
also
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
good
hoppiness
to
it
there
are
some
boozey
aromas
coming
off
of
it
also
the
taste
of
this
has
a
good
malt
base
with
some
pine
nots
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
here
its
got
a
nice
thickness
about
it
overall
its
not
a
bad
barley
wine
at
all
found
it
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
overall
this
stays
true
to
an
english
barleywine
strong
and
hoppy
with
the
malt
character
taking
a
backseat
its
robust
and
flavorful
but
ultimately
unrefined
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
few
more
bottles
to
stick
in
the
cellar
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
one
finger
cream
colored
head
that
settles
slowly
to
a
quarter
inch
and
leaves
splotchy
rings
of
lace
down
the
glass
smell
a
ton
of
caramelized
sugars
faded
pine
and
earthy
hopping
date
a
little
apple
skin
taste
again
lots
of
caramel
atop
toasted
grain
piney
and
earthiness
red
plum
with
skin
medium
bodied
sugary
very
earthy
and
drying
finish
pretty
good

o
i
think
its
solid
throughout
and
a
very
good
barlewyine
this
is
my
first
beer
from
duckrabbit
and
i
thought
it
was
satisfying
and
a
very
enjoyable
treat
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
a
couple
bottles
if
im
ever
somewhere
this
is
sold
decent
beer
but
the
flavors
are
just
a
bit
off
for
me
served
from
bottle
into
a
duckrabbit
snifter
poured
redorange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
caramel
cream
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
good
brew
nicely
well
balanced
flavor
going
on
in
this
one
that
you
never
would
get
tired
of
also
has
an
excellent
aroma
going
on
to
match
it
a
definite
must
try
overall
due
to
case
laws
i
have
not
found
a
place
that
has
duck
rabbit
six
packs
singles
run
between
34
dollars
so
i
could
easily
throw
1012
dollars
on
a
four
pack
definitely
a
fine
barleywine
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
big
beer
it
is
good
nothing
crazy
o
i
loved
everything
about
this
beer
simply
delicious
a
sipper
for
sure
but
a
great
treat
a
little
to
heavy
for
an
everyday
drinker
but
excellent
overall
o
not
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
love
english
bw
but
this
one
falls
a
bit
off
the
wagon
weird
metallic
taste
and
a
bit
of
a
messy
taste
unbalanced
nice
balance
of
flavors
very
rich
overall
just
too
sweet
and
that
overwhelmed
everything
else
o
i
tend
to
forget
that
there
is
a
difference
between
american
and
english
barleywines
and
drank
about
14
of
this
not
knowing
what
was
happening
then
i
remembered
that
this
is
an
english
barleywine
given
that
id
say
its
a
pretty
nifty
representation
of
the
style
but
just
a
tad
more
in
the
alcohol
area
than
others
ive
had
not
for
drinking
after
two
or
three
other
beers
but
as
a
nice
aperitif
i
think
it
works
pretty
well
with
all
the
sweet
cherry
tastes
going
on
d
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
just
not
sweet
enough
for
an
english
barleywine
even
if
it
was
mislabeled
here
on
ba
i
still
wouldnt
classify
it
as
a
good
example
of
american
barleywine
january
2009
bottle
pours
a
perfect
brown
that
pops
red
held
up
in
front
of
a
light
with
two
fingers
of
tan
head
this
looks
dead
on
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
but
not
too
sweet
a
twinge
of
faded
hops
smells
very
good
the
taste
is
not
as
good
as
the
appearance
or
the
nose
a
faded
hop
bitterness
starts
things
out
and
dries
the
palette
this
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
pokes
its
head
out
and
then
falls
back
away
the
taste
is
all
drying
dead
hops
what
a
let
down
this
is
one
to
open
after
a
few
more
years
or
fresh
i
would
guess
in
this
bottle
the
hops
suppress
the
malt
flavor
almost
entirely
but
taste
dead
themselves
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
bigger
than
medium
with
that
drying
in
the
mouth
solid
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
a
big
letdown
it
just
doesnt
taste
very
good
never
had
an
english
barleywine
that
was
bland
dry
and
with
little
to
no
sweetness
maybe
this
is
just
a
dead
period
in
the
aging
overall
a
good
barleywine
that
doesnt
show
too
boozy
thanks
for
the
opportunity
if
youre
looking
for
a
crazily
malty
beer
this
is
a
good
one
drinkable
as
a
sipper
definitely
dont
want
to
be
sessioning
this
stuff
o
a
fantastic
beer
id
have
another
taste
starts
sweet
lightly
fruity
in
the
middle
then
goes
all
tannins
and
alcohol
at
the
close
leathery
lingering
mouthfeel
is
soft
over
the
tongue
not
quite
as
smooth
as
i
would
hope
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
as
exciting
as
i
hoped
overall
this
beer
does
not
remind
me
of
an
english
barleywine
there
are
way
too
many
hops
and
no
sweetness
seems
to
be
unbalanced
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
orangish
dark
amber
color
there
was
a
small
off
white
head
on
it
that
leaves
some
lacing
piney
and
citrus
hops
to
the
nose
but
not
overly
done
some
caramel
and
mustiness
also
the
taste
is
good
subdued
bitterness
with
lots
of
citrus
and
some
hop
flavors
fair
amount
of
caramel
malt
with
the
sweetness
masked
and
balanced
by
the
hops
somewhat
dry
finish
not
bad
at
all
this
should
age
quite
nicely
the
pine
and
caramel
notes
are
in
a
bit
of
conflict
right
now
but
some
age
should
round
those
flavors
out
and
cut
some
of
the
heat
off
the
finish
my
guess
is
that
with
a
couple
of
years
on
it
this
will
become
quite
extraordinary
as
it
is
this
is
well
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
your
barleywines
to
be
just
one
step
away
from
being
a
dipa
interested
to
taste
these
with
some
age
d
a
very
wellbalanced
barleywine
especially
for
11
goes
down
easily
and
doesnt
leave
me
feeling
like
im
about
to
get
diabetes
like
some
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
but
without
being
too
hot
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
ive
had
many
better
balance
barleywines
this
one
seems
more
like
a
booze
bomb
blended
with
a
very
dry
taste
blended
in
maybe
try
if
you
like
dr
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
not
it
comes
off
as
more
of
an
american
barleywine
but
its
pretty
good
could
use
more
malt
presence
but
it
has
some
nice
stuff
going
on
rich
golden
brown
beer
with
a
clean
head
with
some
retention
really
classic
english
malt
profiles
rich
caramel
toasted
brown
sugar
raisin
molasses
hints
of
cocoa
toast
light
citric
hopping
which
provides
a
light
bitterness
and
drying
in
the
finish
hides
the
abv
real
well
very
full
flavored
just
so
tasty
d
not
easy
to
put
down
by
any
means
for
the
style
however
this
brew
is
flavorful
enough
and
lacks
any
taste
of
alcohol
to
add
to
its
drinkability
considering
its
style
d
this
had
a
nice
scent
and
taste
with
well
balanced
elements
not
dissimilar
from
something
like
old
ruffian
or
even
a
fresh
gratitude
but
not
quite
as
bold
or
complex
as
either
of
those
the
alcohol
was
quite
noticeable
in
the
scent
not
as
much
in
the
taste
so
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
this
will
probably
improve
with
age
as
its
still
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
fresh
this
beer
was
good
but
it
was
only
reminiscent
of
the
truly
great
barleywines
as
good
as
this
is
now
i
could
see
some
age
doing
wonders
for
this
beer
i
might
just
have
to
convince
the
wife
we
need
a
whole
six
pack
in
addition
to
the
two
singles
i
bought
final
thoughts
i
didnt
go
into
this
beer
with
high
expectations
but
i
finished
this
beer
very
impressed
and
am
sorry
that
i
dont
have
another
well
done
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
about
average
for
the
style
it
has
a
bit
of
a
rich
and
creamy
feel
to
it
as
well
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
a
nice
rich
malty
flavor
to
it
but
also
didnt
become
too
sweet
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
and
an
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
d
if
this
wasnt
listed
as
a
barleywine
i
might
have
a
hard
time
telling
considering
how
drinkable
it
is
a
bit
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
peeks
through
and
sweetness
may
be
just
a
tad
overpronounced
but
even
saying
that
is
nitpicking
d
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
if
they
can
cut
down
on
the
residual
sugars
and
get
this
down
a
bit
more
they
will
have
a
real
winner
on
their
hands
wow
really
well
crafted
not
cloying
at
all
wraps
all
the
classic
barley
malt
inside
a
fuzzy
edged
hoppiness
71st
i
like
d
ok
but
this
beer
is
obviously
a
little
hot
right
now
im
not
sure
how
old
or
young
this
bottle
is
but
it
could
probably
benefit
from
a
few
more
months
in
the
cellar
if
not
a
year
all
in
all
before
i
had
my
first
duck
rabbit
beer
i
was
ridiculously
excited
about
this
brewery
while
there
have
been
some
exceptions
milk
stout
is
very
good
schwarzbier
is
aboe
average
for
the
most
part
ive
been
disappointed
for
a
dark
beer
specialist
their
specialty
is
rather
unrefined
comes
out
of
the
tap
an
opaque
light
reddish
chocolatebrown
with
a
finebubbled
pale
yellowish
tan
head
strong
malty
fruitysweet
aroma
is
rather
inviting
flavor
is
strongly
fruity
and
like
a
proper
barleywine
has
a
fierce
alcohol
bite
texture
is
lively
edgy
and
tingly
tasted
very
nice
follows
the
nose
some
oak
in
there
as
well
a
bit
hot
in
alcohol
but
i
am
very
much
enjoying
this
beer
medium
body
slight
funk
in
the
aftertaste
but
you
get
used
to
it
pretty
quick
nice
beer
quite
the
enjoyable
barleywine
the
hops
are
a
bit
aggressive
right
now
especially
given
the
style
so
if
you
have
one
of
these
id
recommend
waiting
a
few
months
to
let
it
mellow
out
a
bit
a
bit
of
age
should
really
bring
out
the
malt
flavors
and
could
make
this
an
excellent
beer
going
forward
as
it
is
now
its
good
just
not
great
recommended
d
decent
not
the
best
but
i
think
ill
give
the
other
bottle
a
few
years
and
revisit
it
then
3
5
a
nice
fallwinter
brew
ill
update
my
scores
upon
trying
this
one
fresh
not
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
barleywine
but
id
like
to
try
it
1
fresh
and
2
with
a
couple
of
years
on
it
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
of
the
dr
seasonals
d
ok
at
11
this
isnt
one
im
going
to
have
too
many
of
even
more
so
as
it
was
a
single
of
a
beer
not
distributed
in
my
state
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
another
poured
into
a
snifter
body
is
a
moderate
copper
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
some
legs
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
some
brown
sugar
a
bit
of
fruit
booze
and
caramel
taste
is
pretty
good
with
some
sweet
bread
and
fruit
plus
a
bit
of
booze
and
caramel
feel
is
slightly
boozy
but
the
flavors
combine
and
have
a
nice
body
drinks
well
but
could
use
some
age
notes
hmmm
i
havent
had
much
stuff
from
the
duckrabbit
but
when
i
have
the
quality
has
been
pretty
commendable
and
worth
repeating
this
brew
adds
to
that
conclusion
d
great
all
the
way
around
d
an
odd
outlier
of
a
barleywine
with
some
different
and
not
cohesive
fruity
aspects
combined
with
a
very
bready
toasty
malt
profile
produces
a
weird
mix
of
flavors
that
dont
quite
add
up
d
nice
drinkability
i
could
drink
about
a
pint
or
two
bottles
a
night
its
boozy
but
at
11
its
kind
of
expected
i
enjoy
it
though
and
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
nice
sticky
2
inch
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
has
a
ton
of
bready
notes
lots
of
sweet
toffee
and
caramel
with
a
pleasantwarming
alcohol
finish
definitely
a
full
bodied
sipper
an
enjoyable
barleywine
db
a
strong
barleywine
with
big
dark
fruit
profile
aggressive
but
i
enjoy
that
in
this
style
this
would
probably
age
pretty
well
if
the
malt
came
forward
a
bit
more
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
low
to
medium
carbonation
nice
id
tried
this
once
before
and
remembered
it
being
pretty
enjoyable
it
held
up
similarly
well
blind
definitely
would
like
to
drink
more
of
this
as
well
as
drs
other
stuff
d
i
purposely
let
this
beer
age
a
little
bit
before
drinking
it
because
of
hearing
about
the
alcohol
strength
even
with
several
months
on
it
i
still
find
the
beer
to
be
on
the
harsh
side
nicely
drinkable
but
not
for
me
very
well
made
though
great
way
to
end
the
day
slowing
doing
to
enjoy
and
savor
one
of
the
finer
barley
wines
mfd
an
initial
sizzle
of
carbonation
but
leaves
a
dry
heat
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
certainly
a
new
take
on
the
barleywine
but
im
glad
i
shared
the
bottle
thin
head
covers
the
surface
just
eggshell
white
some
larger
bubbles
form
an
island
to
the
side
zero
lacing
murky
liquid
mix
of
muddy
brown
to
orange
rust
to
sand
yellow
completely
opaque
no
clear
sign
of
any
floating
matter
inside
richly
layered
nose
of
fruitcake
rum
raisin
ice
cream
walnuts
fig
golden
raisin
apricot
peach
and
pineapple
slides
in
white
and
pink
grapefruit
mandarin
orange
before
the
honey
and
molasses
sweetness
catches
cuts
a
sharp
enough
profile
that
you
can
only
rarely
catch
scents
of
chocolate
or
cocoa
fullbodied
drier
than
expected
however
this
doesnt
impede
its
ability
to
cover
the
whole
palate
pine
and
orange
lemon
grapefruit
citrus
appear
first
certainly
has
the
hops
to
challenge
the
malts
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
are
moderate
and
while
boozy
theres
little
burn
the
fruit
fresher
here
less
raisin
fig
and
more
peach
apricot
pear
red
cherry
lowkey
nuttiness
and
breadiness
just
parts
of
a
whole
you
sense
that
the
carbonation
is
trying
hard
but
still
unable
to
break
up
the
density
keeps
your
mind
engaged
but
a
bit
tiring
to
drink
balance
is
the
charm
here
and
even
within
balance
there
can
be
complexity
the
11
percent
is
definitely
there
though
not
within
the
first
couple
of
sips
a
lovely
sipper
to
be
had
overall
a
very
drinkbable
english
bwine
i
like
all
the
fruit
flavors
in
this
beer
for
11
this
drinks
amazing
nicely
done
drank
it
out
of
a
bruery
tulip
glass
the
first
thing
that
you
notice
is
the
intense
malt
presence
which
obviously
goes
with
the
style
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
than
most
barleywines
while
still
maintaining
a
respectable
level
of
booziness
the
taste
was
most
of
what
you
would
expect
out
of
a
barleywine
with
some
nice
toffee
notes
thrown
in
what
a
jaunty
little
cap
this
brew
pours
a
translucent
burnt
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
toffee
booze
rye
bread
crust
and
a
bit
of
medicinal
aromas
the
taste
also
carries
that
medicinal
astringency
along
with
some
sharp
citrus
hops
toffee
and
maple
syrup
the
body
is
a
heavy
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
gooey
feel
overall
i
think
this
is
the
least
of
the
duckrabbit
brews
ive
yet
had
it
seems
as
though
something
went
awry
i
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
drinkability
is
very
high
dispite
the
abv
i
can
see
a
5
year
old
bottle
of
this
being
incredible
at
11
im
not
sure
ill
be
having
another
d
i
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
not
one
you
could
throw
back
a
few
of
but
a
nice
sipper
tasty
toasty
malty
and
delicious
blech
i
dont
really
understand
why
this
isnt
classified
as
an
americanstyle
barleywine
the
hops
are
much
more
dominant
than
the
malts
regardless
of
which
category
it
belongs
in
this
is
a
poor
beer
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
which
i
will
age
but
im
not
expecting
great
things
a
very
disappointing
beer
from
a
brewery
i
usually
enjoy
d
im
going
to
have
to
put
some
age
on
these
beers
hopefully
that
will
mellow
that
alcohol
out
if
it
works
i
think
this
will
be
a
pretty
good
beer
but
at
the
moment
its
a
little
to
strong
d
delicious
slow
sipping
beer
a
little
too
heavyhanded
with
the
alcohol
but
otherwise
very
nice
pours
a
very
hazy
carmel
color
into
tulip
with
fine
carbonation
and
slight
head
which
coats
with
an
oily
sheen
smells
sweet
and
fruity
with
malt
and
alcohol
tastes
of
carmel
malt
resiny
sweetness
figs
and
raisins
a
bit
boozy
nice
grain
and
citrus
notes
also
slightly
spicy
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
in
finish
and
a
lingering
dryness
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
first
barleywine
review
for
me
and
was
well
pleased
overall
a
strong
ale
and
one
is
plenty
thanks
grant
drinkability
very
decent
for
my
first
barleywine
and
does
go
down
well
almost
reminded
me
of
a
stout
load
of
sweetness
and
i
didnt
mind
it
too
much
cheers
flavor
is
decent
not
the
best
barleywine
and
not
the
best
duck
rabbit
beer
sharp
creamy
mild
quick
fruit
notes
leading
way
to
malts
and
hops
which
last
the
majority
of
the
flavor
slightly
dry
on
the
back
side
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
medium
carbonation
the
booze
definitely
has
quite
a
bite
in
this
one
a
very
good
barleywine
but
again
not
the
best
d
the
booziness
gets
to
me
after
a
while
this
is
still
a
good
beer
though
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
great
looking
garnet
hue
when
held
to
light
tightly
bubbled
off
white
head
peaks
out
but
retreats
under
the
bed
with
the
cats
smells
mostly
of
sweet
dark
fruit
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
cherries
prunes
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
in
there
taste
follows
the
smell
alcohol
soaked
cherries
rolled
in
brown
sugar
and
lightly
caramelized
sums
it
up
pretty
well
finish
is
rather
dry
with
a
lingering
almost
sweet
and
sour
fruit
thick
body
light
carbonation
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
i
really
liked
this
one
its
a
nice
take
on
an
english
style
barleywine
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
some
more
to
lay
down
drinkability
cant
stand
the
heat
get
yourself
from
out
the
kitchen
thats
how
im
feelin
right
now
alcohol
dominates
and
steals
all
my
candy
bummer
i
finished
this
beer
without
a
problem
but
it
was
only
enjoyable
because
of
the
buzz
it
produced
d
this
is
a
let
down
it
smelled
good
but
the
taste
is
just
too
bitter
for
me
i
wish
more
of
the
other
flavors
could
come
through
but
it
isnt
terrible
either
worth
a
try
for
a
11
barleywine
this
is
actually
quite
drinkable
im
not
sure
id
want
more
than
one
but
i
had
no
problem
taking
this
down
drinkability
is
moderate
at
best
but
overall
it
is
pretty
balanced
and
smooth
for
the
style
overall
an
ok
beer
which
i
would
not
mind
having
again
sometime
smell
and
appearance
are
by

the
highlights
appears
reddish
orange
in
color
with
a
small

with
a
nice
ring
smells
of
caramel
rich

the
taste
is

the

is

an

ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
this
brewer
d
d
fairly
easy
drinker
alcohol
burn
is
very
minimal
for
such
a
high
abv
think
this
one
may
need
a
bit
of
time
to
mellow
out
the
hoppiness
pours
a
beautiful
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
and
frothy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
hoppier
than
you
would
expect
from
an
english
bw
with
big
floral
and
citrusy
notes
along
with
some
caramel
toffee
molasses
and
some
dark
fruit
the
flavor
has
some
fig
and
plum
notes
initially
along
with
caramel
and
toffee
floral
hops
green
apple
rum
raisins
and
a
little
sourness
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
a
really
solid
english
barleywine
much
better
than
brooklyns
monster
ale
fairly
idiosyncratic
as
its
hoppier
than
you
would
expect
and
has
a
little
sourness
to
it
that
adds
complexity
d
im
liking
this
barleywine
a
lot
more
than
some
others
ive
tried
it
has
a
nice
showcase
of
sweetness
and
balance
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
this
is
the
best
smelling
bw
ive
had
if
they
could
lose
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
that
would
be
a
top
100
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
amber
brown
in
color
with
only
abundant
head
this
beer
has
a
strong
hop
taste
up
front
lots
of
malts
along
with
candied
fruits
dried
plums
grapes
an
overly
sweet
juicey
citrus
bite
from
the
hops
very
strong
boozey
smell
not
very
well
hidden
at
all
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
chewy
this
one
is
a
sipper
with
limited
drinkability
not
their
best
offering
but
still
good
and
fairly
refreshing
for
a
barleywine
d
it
was
a
good
offering
and
i
could
drink
more
of
this
dthis
is
a
little
bit
of
a
mess
its
kind
of
all
over
there
in
the
taste
and
really
hoppy
for
an
english
barleywine
the
booze
is
quite
strong
throughout
and
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
frequently
good
drinkability
with
the
alcohol
being
wellconcealed
in
the
smell
and
taste
delicious
smelling
and
tasting
beer
more
of
american
bareywime
because
it
was
really
hoppy
nice
caramel
sweeness
but
not
overpwering
at
all
loads
of
citrus
from
the
hops
and
beer
smelled
similar
to
what
is
tastes
like
body
was
light
for
a
bw
and
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
was
extremely
impressed
nice
job
dr
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
incredibly
drinkable
it
has
a
great
body
its
fruity
with
hints
of
bitter
hops
the
finish
is
dry
which
opens
the
beer
up
and
gives
i
think
one
bottle
is
enough
for
a
nice
sipper
on
a
cool
nc
night
pours
a
dark
copper
brown
almost
black
but
clear
and
with
a
solid
tan
head
smells
like
brown
sugar
sweet
malt
candied
fruit
a
lot
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
and
a
hint
of
coffee
and
cigarettes
the
first
taste
is
powerful
with
a
strong
alcohol
bite
but
follows
up
with
lots
of
malt
sugar
and
waves
of
toffee
caramel
honey
and
raisins
its
surprisingly
smooth
and
after
the
first
taste
its
increasingly
drinkable
and
at
11
alcohol
perhaps
dangerously
so
the
palate
unfortunately
doesnt
live
up
to
the
nose
a
grainy
astringency
is
very
strong
husky
and
palatewrecking
it
even
covers
up
the
sweetness
to
a
good
extent
once
my
palate
has
had
a
chance
to
get
used
to
it
i
notice
a
blend
of
fruit
dates
raisins
and
a
little
stone
fruit
peach
apricot
coupled
with
a
solid
sweetness
with
flavors
of
caramel
honey
and
some
toffee
sweet
and
astringent
on
the
finish
theres
lingering
flavors
of
honey
and
some
astringency
full
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
decent
on
the
palate
a
bit
of
a
sipper
not
necessarily
something
id
go
out
to
seek
the
achilles
heel
of
this
body
you
just
cant
embrace
it
how
dark
are
barleywines
anyway
why
are
the
selfproclaimed
dark
beer
specialists
making
a
barleywine
though
respectably
true
to
style
its
okay
at
best
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
i
love
this
and
all
of
the
other
beers
that
duckrabbit
produces
d
this
beer
has
a
rich
malt
with
a
slightly
sweet
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
with
just
enough
hops
to
support
the
malt
d
this
wasnt
tops
on
my
barleywine
list
but
it
was
decent
the
strange
tartness
in
the
nose
and
the
amount
of
carbonation
didnt
ruin
the
experience
but
didnt
help
either
taste
is
fairly
decent
nice
fruitiness
with
a
light
burn
from
the
high
abv
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
rich
light
carbonation
and
thick
feel
make
it
quite
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
full
body
is
well
carbonated
not
sure
on
the
age
but
this
has
aged
pretty
well
at
leats
a
couple
years
old

drinkability
definitely
one
of
the
better
barleywines
ive
ever
tasted
its
super
smooth
and
easy
drinking
and
amazing
that
its
11
because
its
hidden
very
well
its
got
that
nice
balance
between
sweetbittermaltyhoppy
its
the
beer
i
was
expecting
without
any
disappointment
great
beer
thanks
jeff
hit
first
with
a
kind
of
sharp
liquerise
flavor
with
the
raisin
present
too
towards
the
back
end
the
heat
turns
up
and
the
flavor
mellows
and
becomes
a
little
sweeter
which
is
nice
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
a
bit
chewy
which
helps
coat
the
mouth
with
flavor
pretty
good
i
look
forward
to
more
of
these
in
the
winter
hopefully
d
pretty
good
for
the
style
overall
i
was
impressed
duck
rabbit
does
some
good
things
and
this
is
not
an
exception
sweet
aroma
strong
flavor
warm
booziness
its
good
but
holy
crap
its
strong
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
enjoy
it
on
a
cool
fall
night
drink
is
not
to
hot
a
bit
too
much
warmness
and
not
enough
balance
to
make
this
sessionable
but
then
again
what
barleywine
really
is
sessionable
a
12
ounce
bottle
freshest
by
1209
poured
into
my
adnams
imperial
pint
tumbler
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
crimson
copper
color
with
about
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
head
leaves
only
minimal
traces
of
lace
behind
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
caramel
brown
sugar
pine
tangerine
lemon
apples
sourdough
bread
grass
raisins
sweet
smelling
bitter
tasting
nicely
carbonated
with
a
medium
to
full
body
not
much
alcohol
burn
to
speak
of
quite
drinkable
fresh
while
the
hops
are
still
abundant
drinkability
is
great
i
like
it
but
only
one
a
night
tastes
surprisingly
sweet
given
its
style
and
aroma
the
malt
is
thick
and
it
cuts
into
your
tongue
like
a
chainsaw
through
jello
but
the
long
caramel
sweetness
is
balanced
nicely
by
the
bitter
spice
of
european
hops
a
very
nice
barleywine
done
in
true
duck
rabbit
fashion
deep
mohogany
color
with
brilliant
clarity
off
white
head
persists
for
the
duration
while
leaving
ample
lacing
and
legging
behind
a
classic
look
strong
barley
flavors
take
over
from
there
with
a
sukist
grain
taste
and
aroma
that
completely
dominates
the
beer
molassas
maple
syrup
sorgum
nuttiness
and
plump
grain
flavors
combine
with
plumbs
raisons
grapes
dates
figs
and
nuts
for
a
rich
and
complexly
flavored
ale
hop
flavor
gives
an
herbal
grassy
note
without
interferring
with
the
barley
taste
no
phenolics
or
unnecessary
alcohols
to
detract
very
nice
malt
texture
sets
the
stage
for
the
mouthfeel
while
a
light
syrup
feel
reminds
us
of
a
beer
that
isnt
quite
dry
sweet
without
cloying
rich
without
sticky
and
full
without
thickening
the
beer
has
a
bold
but
delicate
texture
perhaps
the
hop
rates
here
are
a
bit
high
compared
to
j
w
lees
or
tom
hardys
but
the
toasted
barley
gives
a
bit
more
complexity
than
lighter
barleywines
another
world
class
beer
by
duck
rabbit
overall
drinkability
nicely
balanced
flavor
profile
makes
this
a
solid
barleywine
although
i
would
place
it
in
the
american
rather
than
english
category
very
very
good
offering
its
one
to
relax
and
think
about
again
a
stogie
would
play
famously
here
something
that
would
go
nice
with
a
bourbon
in
the
sidecar
nicely
done
d
too
hot
to
really
have
more
than
one
bottle
otherwise
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
aftertaste
isnt
too
strong
i
suspect
this
will
be
good
well
beyond
december
great
frothey
mouthfeel
but
pretty
hot
beer
that
could
use
some
quiet
time
a
hearty
carmel
cream
colored

nearly
reaches
two

starts

is
nicely
sweet
with
some
vanilla
oak
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
includes
a
sappy
hop
character
as
well
enters
the
mouth
with
an
initially
creamy
smoothness
yeasty
sweet
caramelized

tangy
dark

and
burnt
graham

the

but
otherwise
well
hidden
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
and
resin
like
sweet
a
super
drinkable
barleywine
this
is
a
solid
brewery
d
bleh
the
finish
and
mouthfeel
and
strong
alcohol
make
this
tough
to
get
through
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
will
seek
out
more
d
pretty
smooth
for
a
barleywine
mine
cost
3
its
a
pretty
cheap
buzz
not
bad
at
all
even
with
all
the
citrusypiney
american
hopping
the
fact
that
it
was
comparatively
restrained
while
still
solidly
malty
is
what
puts
it
somewhat
between
american
and
english
in
style
anyway
it
certainly
helped
to
get
rid
of
the
taste
from
those
wretched
bottles
of
1996
gales
old
ale
that
i
just
had
to
endure
prior
to
this
this
one
came
as
a
gift
from
some
friends
going
to
philly
many
thanks
pour
reveals
a
copper
colored
beer
with
less
than
a
finger
of
white
head
smell
is
of
sweet
brown
breads
a
bit
of
metallic
aroma
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
is
initially
sweet
upfront
i
get
sweet
molasses
alcohol
more
dark
fruit
and
just
a
little
hint
of
caramel
body
is
heavy
though
there
is
little
carbonation
which
makes
it
feel
bigger
than
it
really
is
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
than
anything
else
overall
a
good
beer
though
one
that
might
benefit
from
a
tiny
boost
of
carbonation
this
is
my
second
beer
from
duck
rabbit
and
while
their
stuff
is
certainly
respectable
so
far
both
offerings
have
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
cheers
d
very
drinkable
which
is
dangerous
i
felt
the
alcohol
half
way
through
my
chalice
im
not
big
on
barleywines
in
general
so
i
really
dont
know
what
im
looking
for
in
one
but
i
throughly
enjoyed
this
one
one
and
done
and
a
bottle
or
two
in
the
cellar
i
think
this
is
past
its
best
by
date
but
who
cares
maybe
they
just
have
to
put
that
on
there
i
had
this
bottle
poured
into
a
duck
rabbit
snifter
the
beer
is
dark
reddish
copper
color
transparent
almost
no
head
the
beer
smells
sweet
and
malty
sort
of
sugary
too
i
think
this
favors
the
american
barley
wine
category
more
than
the
english
variety
a
bit
strong
and
sweet
the
taste
is
likewise
sweet
with
a
little
burn
in
the
aftertaste
a
lingering
boozy
quality
a
very
well
done
interpretation
of
a
style
i
generally
dont
favor
a
good
barleywine
but
on
my
rare
forays
into
barleywine
country
id
pick
up
something
else
smells
of
oak
cashews
metal
bourbon
and
earth
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
a
great
pop
from
the
medium
to
high
amount
of
carbonation
flavor
profile
is
like
the
smell
earthy
its
got
a
dull
bitterness
going
on
nothing
sharp
like
high
hops
would
give
but
bitter
anyways
alcohol
is
noted
but
more
subtle
than
i
thought
an
11
brew
would
have
as
the
beer
warms
i
get
a
sense
of
citrus
in
the
finish
like
an
orange
rind
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
think
this
may
be
my
first
english
bw
but
i
will
explore
this
genre
again
d
not
bad
it
seems
more
like
an
american
barleywine
but
even
for
that
style
its
average
at
best
the
carbonation
is
right
on
and
coats
the
tongue
very
nicely
kind
of
sticky
im
finding
this
stuff
goes
down
nice
and
easy
i
could
put
away
a
few
on
these
in
a
sitting
a
nice
barleywine
not
super
but
good
i
could
easily
drink
this
again
and
would
not
turn
it
down
it
gets
much
better
as
it
warms
and
the
head
lasted
the
whole
time
i
have
not
been
disappointed
with
one
of
their
brews
i
would
love
to
see
them
move
closer
or
distribute
in
the
area
very
boozy
and
an
early
spring
cold
night
seems
so
right
for
it
pours
a
dirty
blond
with
fantastic
splattering
of
lace
smells
and
taste
like
a
boozy
barleywine
drinkable
after
all
a
bit
of
substance
to
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
its
11
wow
this
stuff
is
great
copper
strong
aroma
and
flavor
of
dark
caramel
and
dark
english
toffee
with
some
mellow
medium
dark
fruit
balanced
by
a
pretty
stiff
herbal
hops
bitterness
really
kind
of
shockingly
drinkable
for
a
big
barleywine
leaves
a
burning
alcohol
residue
down
your
throat
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
even
if
it
was
on
performance
enhancing
drugs
poured
into
my
duckrabbit
tumbler
glass
poured
a
small
but
decent
head
that
left
thick
light
brown
lacing
the
color
is
very
dark
on
the
edges
has
a
very
dark
maroon
color
to
it
the
smell
is
has
a
bit
of
friutfulness
to
it
detected
a
touch
of
alchohol
taste
has
a
up
front
fruity
sweetness
to
it
alcohol
is
fairly
hidden
in
here
but
you
can
still
in
the
end
of
it
then
backed
up
with
a
nice
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
without
much
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
but
smooth
overall
this
is
a
decent
barelywine
its
good
but
this
doesnt
hide
the
alcohol
very
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
its
not
quite
smooth
enough
this
isnt
my
idea
of
the
ideal
barleywine
but
thats
not
to
say
it
doesnt
still
make
for
a
good
one
im
still
not
entirely
sure
of
just
how
much
i
like
or
love
the
beer
but
i
had
this
same
conundrum
with
this
brewerys
imperial
stout
like
the
drawing
on
their
labels
after
which
the
brewery
is
named
this
too
can
be
seen
as
two
different
things
a
good
what
i
think
or
great
maybe
to
some
barleywine
either
way
there
isnt
any
wrong
answer
d
this
is
a
pretty
damned
nice
beer
this
beer
is
good
or
better
in
all
categories
the
smell
and
taste
are
all
solid
and
this
beer
truly
shines
in
the
feel
department
for
a
barleywine
this
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
i
have
noticed
that
this
one
went
down
much
easier
and
quicker
than
previous
barleywines
i
have
had
duck
rabbit
rules
d
while
it
is
a
good
beer
one
could
only
have
one
to
two
during
a
session
due
to
its
high
alcohol
content
this
beer
poured
a
stunning
clear
deep
copper
with
3
inch
fluffy
tan
head
it
has
a
sweet
aroma
of
candied
cherries
plums
and
dates
that
have
been
beaten
with
a
mallet
and
allowed
to
soak
in
alcohol
i
also
get
a
note
of
sweet
caramel
the
first
impression
of
the
flavor
is
that
it
tastes
like
an
english
style
barleywine
theres
a
medley
of
fruit
such
as
dark
dark
cherries
sweet
black
grape
juice
dates
raisins
and
cranberries
i
also
get
a
cherry
cough
drop
quality
d
a
decent
enough
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
bolder
were
the
alcohol
tamed
down
a
bit
i
think
this
brew
would
really
shine
big
blatant
alcohol
detracts
was
definitely
expecting
more
from
this
rather
local
barleywine
overall
i
wish
the
taste
matched
the
pour
i
really
enjoyed
this
barleywine
even
more
so
than
a
year
aged
bigfoot
it
was
very
smooth
and
pretty
tasty
although
being
from
down
east
i
may
be
a
little
biased
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
so
far
and
very
drinkable
overall
i
was
impressed
with
how
good
this
was
fresh
the
older
version
was
certainly
more
balanced
but
the
flavors
in
the
fresh
bottle
were
still
impressive
worth
a
shot
over
all
a
great
brew
only
downside
could
be
carbonation
level
as
far
as
an
english
bw
this
is
an
excellent
example
would
def
have
again
the
aroma
is
full
of
caramel
syrup
fruit
grain
husks
and
hops
the
appearance
is
mahogany
with
a
super
thin
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
some
muskiness
and
soapiness
the
palate
is
typical
for
the
style
overall
its
better
than
average
but
thats
all
very
good
surprising
nice
pour
nice
head
and
amber
straw
color
not
a
ton
of
aroma
but
sweet
and
thick
taste
is
very
good
i
never
wouldve
guessed
that
it
was
11
alcohol
very
very
smooth
and
sweet
nothing
too
bitter
or
burnt
it
may
have
been
better
with
those
qualities
but
it
was
good
feel
is
great
good
carbonation
and
it
goes
down
smooth
and
silky
id
drink
several
of
these
easily
and
with
this
alcohol
content
id
certainly
feel
great
afterward
im
going
to
try
to
get
some
more
of
this
for
sure
side
note
i
was
informed
at
the
brewery
that
between
the
2006
and
2007
season
the
recipe
for
the
barleywine
changed
the
2006
was
ubersweet
the
2007
aged
one
year
was
balanced
and
the
2008
was
very
hoppy
if
you
are
a
hop
worshipper
then
you
might
really
like
this
barleywine
otherwise
youre
going
to
want
to
set
this
aside
for
a
year

lovely
redbronze
colour
with
a
beige
coloured
head
smell
is
terrific
very
sweet
and
malty
actually
reminds
me
of
breakfast
cereal
like
sugar
smacks
or
something
i
like
my
barleywine
to
be
bereft
of
any
hop
bitterness
whatsoever
and
this
one
im
afraid
wraps
up
its
sweet
malty
opening
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
still
good
though
mouthfeel
is
pretty
heavy
as
it
should
be
and
the
11
is
disguised
well
a
good
attempt
by
an
american
brewery
to
replicate
one
of
my
favourite
english
styles
too
bad
maybe
a
bad
bottle
the
runup
to
the
actual
tasting
was
great
but
ultimately
this
beer
doesnt
hold
up
its
end
of
the
bargain
d
easy
to
finish
this
is
one
of
the
better
english
barleywines
that
ive
tried
the
booze
is
somewhat
present
but
i
could
see
it
sneaking
up
on
you
if
you
have
a
couple
3
bottles
split
between
2
people
would
be
perfect
even
though
i
am
not
big
on
darker
beers
i
thuroughly
enjoyed
this
i
have
had
other
english
barleywine
selections
and
wanted
to
give
the
local
guys
a
whirl
i
tried
this
for
the
first
time
at
the
greensboro
brewfest
a
few
months
back
and
picked
up
a
few
bottles
at
the
local
shop
a
few
weeks
ago
i
want
to
try
other
offerings
from
them
in
my
quest
to
support
local
flavor
and
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
quality
of
their
other
stuff
i
cant
wait
d
very
drinkable
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
is
fresh
and
compare
what
these
two
years
have
done
to
this
in
retrospect
but
this
06
bottle
is
drinking
very
well
bottom
line
i
think
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
english
barleywine
style
ale
where
malt
is
king
and
the
hops
are
only
used
to
balance
things
out
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
the
body
is
moderate
to
big
so
sure
this
is
a
year
old
but
it
actually
is
pretty
tasty
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
complexity
in
the
malt
but
overall
good
d
nothing
short
of
great
the
most
complex
barleywine
ive
had
in
a
while
not
necessarily
the
single
best
but
like
a
rubix
cube
of
flavors
the
alcohol
brings
down
drinkability
some
not
hot
just
powerful
very
powerful
get
your
hands
on
this
beer
ive
had
this
brew
before
while
within
its
best
by
range
and
i
can
honestly
profess
that
there
isnt
much
difference
its
good
either
way
d
a
very
good
winter
beer
warming
and
sweet
high
alcohol
presence
is
noticeable
but
not
detracting
flavor
is
sweet
malt
up
front
with
a
bitter
follow
that
brings
to
mind
cherries
and
dark
chocolate
then
mr
alcohol
introduces
himself
with
an
authoritative
but
not
overbearing
presence
warmly
welcoming
this
stuff
is
perfect
for
a
winter
nightcap
but
by
no
means
out
of
place
on
a
warm
fall
evening
looks
nice
hazy
goldbrown
with
red
tinges
small
sandcolored
head
and
solid
lacing
smell
is
quite
sweet
heavy
honey
sugarplums
molasses
taste
is
deep
roasted
malts
balanced
with
dark
fruits
and
an
alcohol
finish
doesnt
have
the
sourness
or
bitterness
found
in
many
barleywines
on
warming
alcohol
becomes
more
apparent
and
fits
the
beer
well
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
feels
like
a
barleywine
drinkability
what
a
great
beer
one
of
the
few
duck
rabbits
i
havent
tried
and
its
a
shame
i
hadnt
before
now
this
is
a
complex
balanced
interesting
fruity
barleywine
and
another
very
impressive
offering
from
what
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
brewery
in
north
carolina
and
thats
saying
a
lot
recommended
along
with
all
their
other
offerings
d
really
easy
to
drink
went
down
way
to
fast
highly
recommended
on
this
one
nice
beer
not
really
necessarily
spot
on
for
the
style
but
interesting
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
feels
heavy
on
the
stomach
bitter
and
slightly
burning
aftertaste
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
this
one
change
over
time
right
now
though
due
to
the
bitterness
and
the
abv
one
is
enough
this
is
a
tasty
sipper
so
dont
get
me
wrong
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
i
dont
love
it
its
too
bitter
a
sipper
for
sure
and
worth
a
try
i
could
not
even
drink
four
ounces
of
this
stuff
and
i
moved
on
to
another
beer
shortly
after
my
dad
did
not
even
want
it
when
i
gave
it
to
him
worst
i
have
had
from
duck
rabbit
will
not
drink
this
again

recommended

in

as
the
bitterness
was

left
a
syrupy
feeling
in

beer
could
materialize
if
aged
but
still
a
good
bwine

a
few
oz

definite

mellowed
by
the
maltiness
hops
are
present

an
underlying

very
strong

glass
i
loved
this
beer
from
when
i
first
smelled
it
i
had
another
barley
wine
that
was
of
the
american
variety
but
it
had
way
too
much
hops
for
me
and
i
didnt
like
the
way
the
flavors
went
together
this
was
way
better
and
i
thought
it
was
more
balanced
i
wish
i
knew
how
old
exactly
this
beer
is
it
only
has
1208
notched
on
the
bottle
it
is
supposed
to
be
released
in
winter
time
so
this
beer
might
be
a
bit
different
from
when
it
is
fresh
the
first
barleywine
i
ever
had
was
englishstyle
and
despite
having
really
developed
a
love
for
extreme
american
styles
since
then
i
really
enjoy
this
is
is
smooth
and
not
at
all
difficult
to
drink
warming
but
not
biting
not
an
everyday
beer
but
one
i
could
happily
drink
often
if
it
was
available
locally
this
is
my
second
sampling
of
the
dr
barleywine
and
i
am
a
bit
more
pleased
this
time
around
not
the
best
englishstyle
in
fact
i
would
have
to
argue
that
it
tastes
a
lot
more
like
an
american
barleywine
with
the
sort
of
hop
profile
it
has
but
an
enjoyable
version
that
caps
off
a
night
perfectly
d
good
drinkability
definitely
a
barleywine
worth
drinking
d
sweet
and
hoppy
this
would
make
a
great
after
dinner
drink
will
be
interesting
to
try
after
it

still
very
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
although
it
is
a
sipper
overall
wellrounded
for

this
is
one

me
long
for

excellent

into

up

maltiness
balanced
by
a
strong
bittering

that
is
reminiscent
of
the

drinkable
for
an
11

alcohol
is
never
dominant
hidden
within
the
polar
balance
of

and
heavy
hops
a
true

barleywine
this
is
my
favorite
way
to
enjoy
barleywines
young
but
balanced
duckrabbit
deserves
some
slack
since
most
of
their
lineup
is
solid
if
unspectacular
porter
and
wee
heavy
scotch
style
ale
are
the
best
so
far
with
only
rabid
duck
russian
imperial
stout
to
go
i
wish
the
brewers
much
better
luck
with
the
second
batch
of
barleywine
ale
d
a
little
too
sweet

me

out
quite
the
colloid
head

thick
and
stands
up

alcohol

also
evident
with

tickling
the
nose
and
an
earthy

the
party
flavors
flood
well
together
drinking
sweet
right
now
but
guaranteed
not
to
be
too
cloying
upfront
sweet
citric
caramel
richness
barrages
my
senses
slightly
burnt
brown
sugar
really
coats
the
palate
with
alcohol
soothing
the
back
of
the
throat
like
a
mild
anesthetic
bitterness
streaks
through
with
piney
citrus
peel
and
herbal
mint
qualities
really
impressive
flow
going
on
this
is
real
barleywine
alcohol
is
evident
but
maybe
i
have
a
high
threshold
im
not
tasting
11
thats
a
good
thing
no
instant
headaches
here
or
fusel
alcohol
ethanol
is
just
another
well
coordinated
aspect
of
the
brew
mouthfeel
is
soothing
with
residual
sugars
coating
the
palate
on
each
sip
strong
even
bitterness
is
left
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
ample
but
not
overdone
body
is
medium
to
full
in
the
spectrum
of
things
overall
drinkability
is
really
great
i
like
this
barleywine
from
the
front
to
the
back
in
every
way
a
great
beer
i
find
it
more
impressive
than
the
baltic
porter
or
standard
porter
ive
had
from
them
what
an
up
and
coming
brewery
thanks
jcdiflorio
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
one
i
also
agree
that
this
beer
will
only
get
better
with
age
if
your
able
to
hold
on
to
one
for
that
long
because
its
drinking
pretty
good
right
now
and
that
friggin
red
eyed
duck
with
the
derby
on
wont
stop
staring
at
me
when
i
open
the
fridge
i
had
to
sample
this
one
thick
and
cloying
with
winelike
dryness
was
a
bit
rough
to
be
real
drinkable
some
aging
would
really
do
this
beer
some
justice
md
mouthfeel
is
rather
heavy
which
is
to
be
expected
and
is
well
matched
to
the
brew
however
i
found
the
strong
alcohol
taste
a
bit
distracting
the
carbonation
is
very
light
but
persistent
although
the
taste
on
the
front
end
of
the
drink
is
quite
good
the
alcohol
linger
is
distracting
to
me
i
enjoyed
the
drink
but
dont
know
if
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
coats
the
entire
mouth
in
that
sticky
bittersweetness
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
from
the
boisterous
levels
of
alcohol
but
this
is
still
an
excellent
sipper
drinkability
decent
drinkability
the
eleven
percent
abv
and
huge
sweetness
knock
it
down
a
few
points
a
sipper
in
my
opinion
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
barleywines
when
young
i
think
ill
lay
down
a
couple
and
see
how
they
taste
in
612
months
there
seems
to
be
good
potential
for
aging
in
this
beer
definitely
better
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
a
fine
sipping
beer
not
one
i
could
drink
all
night
because
of
the
potency
but
a
nice
one
to
try
from
time
to
time
d
this
one
is
a
huge
barley
wine
that
i
have
been
enjoying
for
over
an
hour
just
sipping
and
enjoying
the
flavors
get
even
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
no
more
than
one
at
a
time
for
me
please
but
a
definite
one
to
recommend
to
others
for
a
taste
treat
glad
to
have
duckrabbit
down
the
road
in
farmville
d
the
high
abv
and
intense
sweetness
is
limiting
me
to
one
glass
this
is
not
the
best
that
duck
rabbit
has
taken
to
market
poured
a
clear
ruby
red
with
little
to
no
head
but
a
nice
ring
stuck
around
smelled
of
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
some
alcohol
there
was
a
very
sweet
malt
taste
and
what
seems
like
pure
sugar
there
is
a
lot
of
hot
alcohol
which
detracts
from
the
sweetness
and
some
sour
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
oily
and
the
alcohol
burned
down
the
gullet
this
one
didnt
impress
me
but
i
would
like
to
see
what
it
would
be
like
after
sitting
for
awhile
downstairs
overall
as
bws
go
this
one
is
just
ok
i
have
had
better
from
other
us
breweries
but
it
is
not
bad
i
think
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
and
it
will
be
where
it
needs
to
be
for
sure
drinks
good
between
the
boozeyness
the
dryness
slows
you
down
a
bit
this
bw
has
some
american
traits
that
detract
a
little
but
this
will
only
improve
with
age
cheers
d
pretty
darn
drinkable
particularly
for
something
this
potent
this
is
a
darn
good
barleywine
i
think
i
would
classify
this
as
a
in
between
american
and
english
barleywine
great
seasonal
release
from
duck
rabbit
who
is
now
in
georgia
this
new
arrival
in
georgia
was
picked
up
at
greens
on
buford
highway
today
as
i
poured
the
beer
into
an
over
sized
wine
glass
i
was
surprised
at
the
level
of
carbonation
and
head
retention
in
this
11
abv
brew
the
body
was
burnished
copper
in
color
and
clear
the
aforementioned
head
was
a
good
three
fingers
thick
and
was
creamy
enough
to
form
a
volcano
cone
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
soft
caramel
dipped
fruit
the
spicy
hops
were
also
quite
strongly
evident
in
the
smell
the
taste
was
wondrously
earthy
sour
and
my
fears
of
confronting
any
cloying
sweetness
dissolved
away
as
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
seared
down
my
throat
the
dryness
was
like
sipping
on
some
fine
sherry
there
were
some
lingering
dry
fruits
in
the
finish
the
body
felt
a
little
small
but
it
made
this
fine
beer
all
the
more
drinkable
all
of
the
ingredients
felt
a
little
bit
disjointed
at
this
young
age
but
i
can
clearly
see
the
greatness
this
beer
will
achieve
with
a
few
years
of
aging
welcome
to
our
state
duckrabbit
d
incredible
my
notes
from
the
pub
say
should
be
illegal
and
thats
probably
about
right
duck
rabbit
can
do
no
wrong
and
im
proud
to
have
met
the
brewers
tonight
d
thanks
to
barleywinebrewer
for
the
chance
to
try
this
tasty
barleywine
drinkability
nice
beer
im
glad
i
tried
this
since
i
hear
a
lot
about
duck
rabbit
hope
to
try
them
all
from
this
company
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
with
a
bland
finish
overall
this
one
leaves
me
wanting
more
the
flavors
are
one
dimensional
and
i
still
cant
get
past
the
overcarbonation
that
makes
it
impossible
to
pour
sweet
ass
caramel
malty
barley
wine
brew
even
a
pop
of
ris
dark
fruit
in
the
background
sticky
in
the
throat
must
be
18
inch
thick
malt
paint
in
there
of
course
no
hint
of
a
wallop
packing
11
drinks
way
to
easy
a
hammer
wolf
in
session
lambs
clothes
sticky
and
sweet
with
a
lot
of
fruit
going
on
medium
to
full
body
once
the
carbonation
settled
down
things
seemed
to
be
ok
very
complex
d
the
amount
of
carbonation
is
kind
of
annoying
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
beyond
that
pours
a
rusty
amber
in
color
a
slight
haze
but
mainly
clear
a
good
sized
buttery
cream
head
very
slowy
recedes
lacing
as
it
does
nice
sugary
sweet
aroma
with
strong
citrus
notes
like
citrus
candy
caramel
and
breadiness
and
alcohol
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
very
similar
with
a
major
dose
of
sugary
caramel
maltiness
and
strong
citrus
flavor
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
creamy
yet
big
and
thick
and
sugary
chewiness
cut
in
the
finish
with
some
alcohol
heat
alcohol
is
very
well
balanced
in
all
aspects
for
its
size
unique
and
tasty
beer
some
barleywine
characteristics
but
for
me
more
like
an
very
large
imperial
red
or
malty
strong
ale
either
way
a
very
good
sipper
love
to
see
what
some
age
will
do
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
its
very
high
abv
and
sweetness
leaves
this
beer
only
decently
drinkable
that
having
been
said
i
still
applaud
the
take
on
the
style
and
the
attempt
by
dr
still
an
excellent
local
nc
brewery
very
nice
somewhat
pale
ruby
color
with
a
decent
head
on
top
fruity
and
toffeeish
aroma
great
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
flavor
of
dried
fruits
and
rasiens
this
has
english
barleywine
all
over
it
for
sure
slight
bitterness
to
it
but
balanced
against
a
considerable
amount
of
sweetness
i
was
expecting
a
slight
alcohol
harshness
for
11
but
none
here
great
body
for
the
style
not
overly
syrupy
simply
a
great
example
quite
the
sipper
for
sure
best
us
version
of
an
english
barleywine
i
have
had
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
just
seems
a
bit
weird
to
my
taste
buds
it
definitely
hides
the
11
alcohol
quite
well
duckrabbits
barleywine
pours
a
clear
rubyaccented
dark
chestnut
body
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
tan
foam
the
rich
aroma
rises
up
at
you
malty
fruity
hoppy
its
english
in
nature
but
with
more
fruitiness
than
youd
normally
expect
the
head
drops
steadily
to
an
average
collar
but
walls
of
spotty
lace
are
left
behind
its
kind
of
nice
almost
like
polka
dots
the
flavor
bears
out
what
the
nose
suggests
and
its
malty
with
a
healthy
cereal
characteristic
and
lots
of
sweetish
caramelized
sugar
theres
a
touch
of
toffee
and
nuttiness
to
it
as
well
and
the
yeast
has
left
a
small
puddle
of
reddish
fruit
juice
and
lots
of
darkskinned
fruit
as
its
calling
card
the
alcohol
is
kept
in
check
but
it
helps
to
dry
things
along
with
a
very
moderate
astringency
and
solid
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
and
a
bit
spicy
and
earthy
or
mineralish
with
a
combination
of
lingering
hops
leafy
grassy
floral
and
dark
skinned
fruit
its
wellbalanced
well
rounded
and
well
polished
yet
all
of
its
components
remain
able
to
shine
on
their
own
very
nicely
done
certainly
worth
trying
im
a
big
fan
of
the
other
duck
rabbit
big
beers
so
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
unfortunately
this
beer
is
out
of
whack
and
in
my
opinion
not
at
all
in
the
same
caliber
as
their
other
beers
next
time
ill
try
it
again
from
the
bottle
and
let
it
age
some
and
see
if
it
improves
pours
dark
amber
with
a
big
head
that
lasts
surprisingly
long
given
the
high
abv
the
smell
is
surprisingly
light
and
has
a
vegetal
note
to
it
tomato
that
is
a
little
offputting
the
taste
has
more
tomato
and
on
top
of
that
is
way
too
sweet
strong
alcoholic
sugar
water
with
a
tomato
tinge
no
thanks
the
flavor
is
just
bizarre
i
would
put
this
down
to
the
keg
being
off
if
it
hadnt
been
served
to
me
by
the
brewery
at
the
hickory
hops
fest
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
also
a
little
too
slick
this
one
is
not
utterly
bad
but
its
got
some
flavors
going
on
that
i
just
dont
find
that
palatable
im
not
sure
what
went
wrong
here
but
i
think
this
beer
probably
doesnt
belong
on
draft
d
its
just
not
my
kind
of
flavors
really
strange
blend
of
flavors
looks
good
though
this
is
a
great
beer
right
now
unlike
last
years
beer
which
needed
six
months
or
so
to
mature
it
comes
very
close
to
being
an
american
barleywine
instead
of
an
english
one
well
i
like
this
beer
mouthfeel
may
be
bigger
and
bolder
than
anything
i
remember
trying
just
a
huge
round
chewy
monster
of
a
barley
wine
somewhat
discombobulated
with
complex
flavors
lingering
on
every
tastebud
of
my
tongue
first
and
foremost
are
a
huge
thick
syrupy
caramel
toffee
malt
slight
milk
chocolate
with
a
fig
reduction
sauce
type
flavor
alcohol
plays
a
large
role
but
doesnt
interfere
with
anything
a
nice
burn
in
the
chest
white
raisin
and
maple
syrup
help
round
things
out
with
the
slightest
bit
of
vanilla
bean
on
the
long
finish
such
a
big
beer
this
is
a
hard
drink
but
i
love
the
style
and
could
drink
a
few
before
passing
out
crystal
clear
burnt
orange
topped
by
a
generous
beige
head
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
especially
given
the
gravity
looks
pretty
viscous
bubbles
rise
very
slowly
through
the
beer
citrusy
aroma
some
tangerine
a
little
fruity
slight
banana
caramel
light
alcohol
very
sweet
lots
of
residual
sugar
makes
this
pretty
thick
alcohol
is
well
controlled
bitterness
is
very
restrained
orange
hop
flavour
throughout
with
pine
resin
backing
this
up
malt
is
a
little
crackery
fairly
low
carbonation
sticky
some
warmth
this
is
a
really
strange
barleywine
it
doesnt
quite
fit
my
expectations
for
the
style
but
its
pretty
good
and
is
an
easy
drinker
poured
into
a
chalice
a
deep
dark
cleanclear
reddish
color
nice
carbonation
huge
creamy
tannish
head
tons
of
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
malts
cherries
a
tangyness
some
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
slightly
tangy
a
good
dose
of
cherries
some
caramel
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
medium
body
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
one
very
different
from
an
american
barleywine
theres
a
nice
sweetness
to
it
dark
fruits
very
enjoyable
highly
recommended
drinkability
i
experienced
an
immediate
warmth
from
the
11
abv
but
it
wasnt
distracting
an
interesting
combination
id
like
to
know
more
about
whats
going
on
complex
but
not
compelling
edit
after
reading
another
review
i
agree
the
smell
and
taste
is
somewhat
of
overcooked
vegetables
not
pleasant
at
all
drinkability
an
easy
to
drink
brew
nothing
to
complex
lots
of
alcohol
but
fairly
well
hidden
firey
orange
color
big
head
the
nose
doesnt
offer
anything
of
distinction
just
a
very
light
smell
flavor
brings
some
super
sweet
malt
and
some
unusual
fruit
flavors
some
nice
elements
in
the
flavor
such
as
the
caramellike
finish
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
weird
and
below
average
not
even
close
to
disappointing
or
unsatisfying
but
it
does
lack
some
balance
and
maybe
its
still
too
young
its
sweet
thats
for
sure
should
be
interesting
to
see
what
more
age
does
to
this
and
as
a
selfproclaimed
dark
beer
specialist
with
a
great
track
record
i
bet
duckrabbit
will
only
improve
on
this
initial
recipe
poured
into
my
trusty
red
oak
nonic
a
deep
auburn
with
a
tight
formed
2
finger
of
white
head
that
left
spotty
lacing
as
it
settled
slowly
brown
sugar
and
almost
cinnamonlike
spice
hit
upfront
in
the
nose
also
quite
floral
with
hints
of
minty
leaf
hoppiness
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
for
such
a
big
beer
not
big
and
chewey
like
i
would
have
liked
still
not
a
major
flawdark
fruit
and
alcohol
warnth
standout
after
the
first
few
sips
along
with
some
honey
sweetness
with
decent
herbal
smack
of
hops
showing
thru
late
i
detected
quite
an
alcohol
zip
thruout
from
beginning
to
end
making
it
a
one
and
done
for
me
for
sure
still
its
got
good
flavors
and
well
it
should
be
a
sipper
anyways
12
oz
bottle
received
in
a
trade
with
leftmindedrighty
the
pour
was
redbrown
with
a
very
nice
sized
white
head
the
smell
was
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
the
same
with
an
added
medicinal
quality
as
well
as
cherry
cough
syrup
i
was
really
let
down
by
this
as
i
have
loved
drs
porter
and
baltic
oh
well
it
was
worth
a
try
poured
goldenyellowred
almost
brown
from
a
12oz
bottle
almost
no
head
slight
floral
smell
tasted
slightly
bitter
with
obvious
high
alcohol
content
virtually
no
lacing
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
i
like
the
kick
if
this
is
your
session
beeryou
are
an
alcoholic
this
is
definately
an
enjoyable
barleywine
not
all
malt
like
a
lot
of
english
barleywines
but
the
dark
fruits
and
maltiness
do
dominate
nice
mild
hop
finish
quality
brew
from
duckrabbit
this
is
my
first
bottle
from
them
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
some
others
its
good
but
honestly
i
find
myself
a
bit
underwhelmed
will
sit
on
the
other
to
see
if
this
one
mellows
a
bit
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
head
that
is
quick
to
disappear
no
lacing
smells
super
sweet
no
hops
apparent
taste
is
super
sweet
dark
fruits
prunes
raisins
caramel
with
slightly
fizzy
super
tiny
bubbled
carbonation
very
true
to
the
style
hops
are
almost
nonexistent
and
malts
dominate
very
smooth
and
drinkable
well
done
example
of
the
style
deep
round
flavor
with
a
very
sweet
finish
and
enough
fruit
flavor
to
somewhat
coat
the
intense
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
thick
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
turning
to
a
solid
some
balance
but
could
stand
a
bit
more
hop
i
suspect
this
would
age
well
as
it
has
old
ale
characteristics
this
is
another
fine
example
of
the
style
and
another
brilliant
effort
from
dr
vigorous
pour
yields
a
quickly
diminishing
head
some
nice
laceing
clear
mahogony
color
typical
barleywine
smell
i
detect
some
carmel
apple
and
malt
sweet
malt
taste
hits
the
palete
first
followed
by
citrus
hops
and
warming
from
the
alcohol
i
really
enjoy
barleywines
dont
find
them
that
complex
but
great
for
sipping
and
relaxing
another
winner
from
duck
rabbit
the
duckrabbit
barleywine
pours
from
the
12oz
bottle
into
my
snifter
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
head
like
cappuccino
foam
that
is
just
off
white
this
head
refuses
to
dissipate
as
it
laces
down
the
side
of
the
glass
while
the
beer
slowly
disappears
down
my
throat
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweetness
with
a
strong
presence
of
toasted
malts
this
is
complemented
by
the
alcohol
some
dark
fruits
and
a
vinous
bouquet
the
taste
is
up
front
with
sweetness
similar
to
the
smell
this
is
chased
by
some
bitterness
without
a
strong
hop
presence
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
dark
fruitiness
in
there
that
is
akin
to
the
type
found
in
a
belgium
beer
without
all
of
the
wheat
and
yeast
of
course
the
beer
has
a
slightly
fuller
than
medium
body
with
an
expected
low
carbonation
due
to
the
alcohol
there
is
also
a
bit
of
dryness
on
the
finish
overall
the
duckrabbit
barleywine
is
a
decent
but
certainly
falls
more
along
the
lines
of
an
english
barley
wine
without
the
strong
hop
presence
that
consumers
have
come
accustomed
to
in
their
american
counterparts
its
a
nice
warming
barley
wine
but
the
strong
sweetness
will
keep
you
from
reaching
for
it
night
after
night
even
when
the
thermometer
drops
below
freezing
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
stranger
feeling
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
the
carbonation
and
the
thick
texture
combine
to
form
almost
a
cottony
mouthfeel
its
not
unpleasant
per
se
but
it
is
a
little
odd
still
i
really
like
the
taste
of
this
barleywine
and
i
hardly
detect
the
formidable
abv
this
is
an
absolute
keeper
not
a
bad
barley
wine
pretty
interesting
but
could
use
a
little
more
balance
taste
sweet
piney
hops
orange
kind
of
tart
alcohol
wasnt
that
noticeable
so
very
smooth
i
like
the
extra
hoppiness
in
this
good
mouthfeel
a
little
sweet
but
well
within
paramaters
for
the
style
a
good
solid
choice
thanks
a
lot
for
this
one
mikegroove
md
slick
mouthcoat
that
soothes
and
warms
on
the
way
down
a
highly
dichotomous
beer
warmingsoothing
bittersweet
its
wonderfully
balanced
and
blended
a
great
barleywine
a
nice
way
to
start
enjoying
a
breweries
beers
the
high
abv
darws
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
but
thats
it
drinkability
this
is
tasty
beer
only
downside
is
that
its
11
abv
which
i
didnt
realize
when
i
opened
it
whoops
poured
a
dark
amberruby
with
a
large
head
and
plenty
of
sticky
retention
very
nice
nose
with
citrusy
fruits
as
well
as
more
smooth
less
pungent
fruits
a
nice
smoky
apple
on
the
front
a
damn
smooth
taste
with
wellhidden
alcohol
and
warm
spicy
undertones
a
smoky
cinnamon
apple
flavor
with
a
dark
ever
so
slightly
bitter
aftertase
very
enjoyable
a
chewy
mouthfeel
initially
that
becomes
smooth
and
light
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
style
very
impressive
i
have
to
admit
i
have
only
recently
gained
an
appreciation
for
barley
wines
this
is
one
of
the
first
that
i
really
enjoyed
last
year
when
i
tried
several
barley
wines
such
as
sn
bigfoot
and
anchor
old
foghorn
i
could
barely
finish
a
glass
as
the
taste
would
diminish
with
each
passing
sip
that
was
not
the
case
with
this
maybe
its
just
my
growingly
intelligent
palate
but
i
found
so
much
complexity
to
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
yet
still
has
great
warming
effect
that
is
perfect
on
a
cold
january
night
the
subtle
hops
provide
a
great
accent
to
the
subtle
fruitiness
i
will
be
putting
away
and
entire
six
pack
and
look
forward
to
seeing
how
well
this
beer
ages
drinkability
eh
taste
is
definately
not
my
favorite
style
caramel
and
tobacco
hard
to
put
a
real
finger
on
its
complex
but
really
just
mediocre
in
its
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
up
front
but
kind
of
lacks
a
strong
finish
is
my
mouth
warming
as
i
take
a
gulp
weird
drinkability
is
okay
i
can
drink
this
for
a
while
surprisingly
goes
great
with
meat
cheese
difficult
to
classify
as
american
or
english
but
a
prime
example
why
duckrabbit
has
emerged
as
one
of
the
premier
craft
breweries
in
the
southern
united
states
very
well
done
overall
i
wouldnt
consider
this
to
be
very
true
to
the
style
but
its
still
a
good
barleywine
drinkability
is
ok
not
something
i
would
run
out
and
buy
more
of
until
i
find
out
how
it
ages
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
and
different
barleywine
very
potent
to
say
the
least
but
it
needs
a
lot
more
malt
which
comes
as
a
shock
to
me
seeing
as
duck
rabbit
usually
puts
out
some
supremely
malty
beers
if
they
tweak
it
just
a
little
bit
this
has
the
potential
to
be
fantastic
definately
not
an
american
barleywine
but
not
really
an
english
one
either
poured
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
small
head
that
faded
to
a
long
lasting
lace
down
the
glass
smells
very
sweet
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
very
rich
this
seems
odd
but
almost
tastes
like
a
toffee
or
candy
flavors
very
intresting
flavor
i
have
never
tasted
this
in
a
beer
before
very
nice
feel
going
down
not
too
thick
and
just
the
right
carbonation
this
is
an
odd
one
i
cant
really
describe
the
taste
but
i
cannot
put
it
down
either
gonna
have
to
come
back
to
this
but
overall
this
was
definatly
good
body
is
a
bit
lacking
it
tastes
big
but
doesnt
feel
so
i
need
a
little
more
body
in
my
big
ales
inspite
of
this
slight
shortcoming
this
is
a
very
tastey
bw
that
will
make
an
interesting
cellaring
candidate
12oz
brown
bottle
with
a

date
of

pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
1
finger
head
with
nice
longevity
and
very
nice
lace
not
you
typical
barleywine
smells
mostly
a
fresh
hop
presence
with
a
fruity
sourness
mixed
in
very
unique
as
barlywines
go
very
fruity
and
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
with
mild
bitterness
caramel
brown
sugar
and
slight
pine
notes
as
well
alcohol
is
well
hidden
especially
at
11
a
different
but
tasty
beer
give
it
a
try
id
prefer
a
bit
stronger
malt
profile
i
think
this
may
cellar
well
but
hard
to
say
that
said
id
easily
put
a
few
in
the
cellar
for
a
tasting
every
612
months
to
see
how
it
matures
overall
im
disappointed
in
this
brew
compared
to
some
of
the
classic
barleywines
this
one
seems
out
of
balance
and
rough
perhaps
some
aging
will
help
i
guess
ill
find
out
as
i
have
5
other
bottles
to
stash
away
in
the
fridge
flavor
is
quite
nice
never
one
of
my
favorite
styles
because
i
usually
find
the
hops
underreaching
or
the
malts
a
bit
over
the
top
here
though
the
malts
are
sweet
to
the
point
of
being
tart
but
then
quickly
rounded
off
with
a
citrusy
candy
hops
the
hops
remind
me
of
another
beer
i
cannot
recall
which
one
but
i
was
to
say
it
is
from
victory
i
will
have
to
look
around
a
bit
alcohol
is
camoflaged
nicely
behind
the
flavors
full
body
that
raps
around
the
mouth
just
a
bit
too
much
can
really
enjoy
this
beer
12
ounce
bottle
poured
an
attractive
orange
amber
color
with
a
massive
head
i
didnt
expect
such
a
large
head
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
aroma
was
of
leafy
hops
citrus
fruit
and
caramelly
malts
taste
was
malty
sweet
with
notes
of
toffee
cherry
and
some
winelike
notes
the
beer
became
more
winey
as
it
warmed
hops
were
much
more
noticeable
in
the
aroma
than
in
the
taste
as
the
bitterness
was
quite
low
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
left
a
syrupy
feeling
in
the
back
of
the
throat
alcohol
was
well
hidden
but
this
beer
could
definitely
benefit
from
some
time
in
the
cellar
as
it
seemed
a
little
bland
to
me
this
is
my
first
disappointment
from
duck
rabbit
not
up
to
par
with
the
other
duckrabbit
seasonal
releases
might
need
to
revisit
and
revise
later
resampled
on
dec
21
nice
body
here
as
well
full
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
barley
wine
i
think
that
it
could
have
stayed
in
the
cellar
for
another
year
or
two
however
the
beer
presents
well
on
the
palate
and
very
drinkable
a
good
english
barleywine
here
is
a
barleywine
that
has
aged
remarkably
i
only
wish
i
had
another
cheers
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
better
alternatives
in
the
style
this
is
a
solid
stronger
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
i
tried
this
fresh
and
thought
it
was
a
bit
hot
so
i
held
on
to
a
couple
of
bottles
to
see
how
they
developed
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
and
lace
smells
of
bready
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
bit
of
earth
and
alcohol
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
bready
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
bit
of
ethanol
to
cut
through
the
sweetness
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
after
two
years
the
alcohol
is
still
a
bit
hot
but
that
is
the
only
thing
providing
any
balance
against
a
really
sweet
syrupy
maltiness
ok
barleywine
definitely
a
sipper
half
finger
off
white
head
on
a
clear
copper
and
crimson
body
aroma
of
candied
orange
caramel
malts
a
little
boozy
and
brown
sugar
carmel
malts
and
sugars
dominate
the
flavor
which
is
slightly
more
boozy
than
average
for
the
style
toffee
and
oak
woody
notes
fairly
sweet
creamy
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
felt
this
one
was
a
touch
more
boozy
than
other
barleywines
but
still
very
drinkable
and
smooth
no
one
quality
in
the
flavor
stood
out
o
considering
its
strength
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
although
the
taste
is
complex
enough
for
it
to
be
slowly
sipped
while
still
keeping
the
interest
of
your
taste
buds
originally
reviewed
11302010
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
barleywine
not
sure
how
it
is
fresh
but
very
good
with
a
year
on
it
lots
of
caramel
and
great
mouthfeel
would
have
it
again
o
tonight
is
barleywine
night
apparently
as
this
is
my
2nd
of
a
possible
3
lets
see
how
i
feel
after
this
ones
gone
eh
this
is
an
excellent
barleywine
being
directly
compared
to
uintas
anniversary
barleywine
ale
id
say
the
harpoon
leviathan
is
a
tad
sweeter
and
lacks
the
barrelaged
oakiness
but
presents
a
more
sweet
malt
character
with
some
more
notes
of
flavor
the
pine
and
citrus
for
example
harpoons
is
more
similar
to
other
barleywines
ive
had
but
still
establishes
a
dry
character
that
i
especially
enjoy
this
is
a
good
night
for
barleywine
in
my
house
its
not
too
sweet
but
it
is
a
sticky
resinous
beer
with
a
solid
body
to
it
i
could
see
this
being
a
hint
thicker
while
dryer
around
the
edges
for
less
of
a
coat
still
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
that
would
pair
well
with
any
number
of
robust
dishes
im
just
enjoying
this
with
some
aged
local
cheddar
this
poured
out
as
a
beautiful
shade
of
red
with
a
white
colored
head
on
top
there
were
some
specks
of
stuff
floating
in
this
one
but
it
didnt
bother
me
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
and
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
some
nice
sharp
bitter
hops
in
there
with
some
big
amounts
of
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
its
got
some
weight
to
it
but
its
not
overly
thick
at
all
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
tasty
i
thought
i
enjoyed
having
it
o
a
good
barleywine
i
wish
there
was
more
of
a
malt
presence
in
the
nose
and
taste
drinks
pretty
smooth
and
easy
for
a
double
digit
abv
overall
quite
drinkable
but
not
really
very
good
i
like
the
flavors
in
the
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
for
me
and
that
puts
it
in
pretty
low
standing
other
than
a
small
bite
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
not
big
enough
to
enough
discount
the
beer
too
much
this
is
a
solid
barleywine
with
the
classic
strong
aroma
you
come
to
expect
from
the
brew
i
cant
say
that
it
ranks
with
the
best
of
the
bunch
in
its
kind
but
i
enjoyed
all
12
oz
of
the
bottle
i
purchased
the
other
night
overall
nice
and
tasty
my
first
review
on
the
newer
updated
ba
poured
into
an
imperial
nonic
a
rich
clear
amber
bronze
with
a
12
finger
head
atop
that
left
a
a
broken
ring
of
lace
as
it
settled
pretty
quickly
deeply
fruity
in
the
nose
along
with
caramle
maltsalot
of
sweet
alcohol
as
well
sweeter
and
alcoholic
on
the
palatesomewhat
hot
it
takes
a
little
while
to
get
used
toafter
awhile
some
fruity
notes
and
leatherlike
flavors
com
in
to
play
but
its
still
an
acoholic
monster
it
looks
greatfeels
greatand
has
alot
going
for
it
but
its
hot
and
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
the
2010
vintage
was
1000
times
better
especially
when
warm
caramel
and
sweet
toffee
created
something
wonderful
if
you
have
this
beer
age
it
from
the
small
sample
of
this
that
i
had
it
would
probably
rate
around
a
4
0
easy
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
and
even
like
it
its
a
fair
price
too
since
its
a
better
value
than
most
barleywines
in
a
bombers
with
a
nice
12oz
size
for
a
one
and
done
sitting
good
beer
oa
decent
barleywine
nothing
too
offputing
however
the
flavors
could
be
stronger
but
it
is
well
balanced
pours
a
clear
garnetruby
color
with
some
dark
brown
mahogany
hues
about
an
inch
of
light
tan
head
develops
leaving
minimal
lacing
upon
dissolution
the
aroma
is
of
grape
juice
faint
plum
some
raisin
a
bit
of
toffee
some
english
malt
and
faint
vanilla
a
strange
capri
sun
essence
to
the
nose
that
also
carries
over
into
the
taste

tongue
along
with

bite
caramel
toffee
and
faint
vanilla
grape
and
alcohol
dominate
mouthfeel
is
average
amply
carbonated
but
an
alcohol
bite
predominates
overall
a
barleywine
with
potential
but
there
are
improvements
to
be
made
12oz
bottle
from
the
leviathan
series
cant
wait
to
see
the
behemoth
series
alright
a
very
deep
ruby
amber
that
gave
a
1
finger
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
layer
with
a
ring
around
the
edges
and
this
one
shows
decent
lace
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruits
caramel
and
fresh
barley
wait
is
that
vanilla
what
the
taste
is
of
plums
a
little
red
box
that
contained
raisins
maybe
some
cherries
but
the
black
guys
with
a
caramel
malt
and
vanilla
there
has
to
be
vanilla
in
this
beer
i
need
to
talk
to
someone
important
from
harpoon
asap
i
love
vanilla
it
is
my
kryptonite
when
done
right
and
its
like
i
have
a
fucking
tractor
beam
you
like
apples
there
is
definite
alcohol
in
the
end
some
hops
i
dont
get
much
of
an
english
presence
at
all
maybe
because
this
isnt
my
first
brew
i
dunno
nor
do
i
care
anyway
the
mouth
feel
is
heavy
and
carbonated
a
bit
more
than
i
would
prefer
but
on
a
micro
scale
this
is
a
big
beer
and
its
not
here
to
quench
your
thirst
michael
go
get
some
lemonlime
ya
kike
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
much
more
than
the
dipa
its
well
done
a
bit
rough
right
now
but
has
some
serious
underrated
potential
its
the
carbonation
and
bermuda
triangle
storm
but
i
can
see
through
that
nonsense
and
im
going
to
age
some
of
this
and
its
going
to
turn
out
fanfuckingtastic
i
know
this
drink
it
ya
kike
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
redorange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wheat
and
corn
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
wheat
wood
and
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
aroma
on
this
one
really
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
honestly
had
the
wheat
and
corn
aroma
you
would
expect
off
of
an
adjunct
lager
however
the
flavor
didnt
follow
suit
here
and
went
to
a
more
traditional
and
solid
barleywine
a
definite
must
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
barleywine
or
curious
alike
this
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
barley
malt
but
not
in
a
negative
way
its
just
not
as
slick
and
only
as
many
within
the
style
range
o
i
can
never
really
decide
if
i
like
barley
wines
r
not
im
pretty
sure
my
mind
changes
daily
but
this
one
was
pretty
nice
a
bit
aggressive
but
i
think
that
character
really
fits
the
style
o
this
is
the
best
harpoon
brew
i
have
ever
had
it
is
a
pretty
good
english
barleywine
the
alcohol
is
one
of
the
most
prominent
character
that
makes
one
of
these
beers
really
nice
to
have
but
that
is
about
all
you
can
have
i
would
definitely
get
this
beer
again
sometime
bottle
from
october
2010
been
cellaring
since
poured
from

into

a
rich
dark

with
a
creamy
off
white
head
that
stands
on

of
the
beer
no
receding
some
lacing
stays
on
the
side
of
the
glass
a
terrific
looking
beer
smell
toffee
mocha
some
grainy
aromas
caramel
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
very
appetizing
aroma
taste
creamy
mouthfeel
a
rich
sweet
blast
of
dark
fruits
like
prunes
raisins
dark
cherries
very
little
hop
presence
or
bitterness
this
is
just
a
super
smooth
and
drinkable
barleywine
and
no
heat
whatsoever
from
the
abv
it
is
well
hidden
in
the
creamy
sweetness
that
the
beer
offers
i
enjoyed
this
one
will
seek
out
again
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
caramel
chestnut
brown
color
with
wonderfully
resilient
ring
of
foam
it
looks
as
it
should
in
the
snifter
the
aroma
is
a
appetizing
mixture
of
caramel
dates
figs
and
alcohol
very
smooth
borderline
creamy
on
the
palate
the
malt
is
well
developed
with
caramel
fruity
and
earthy
components
all
overlapping
in
coherent
form
a
whisper
of
alcohol
at
the
end
binds
it
together
a
nice
sipping
beer
it
is
not
sweet
and
not
too
hot
o
the
taste
on
this
is
very
weak
to
me
it
has
a
lot
of
good
qualities
and
hopefully
with
age
it
will
take
a
lot
better
i
remember
liking
this
more
the
last
time
i
had
it
overall
this
is
a
decent
barley
ive
certainly
had
better
but
i
would
drink
this
again
its
moderately
priced
and
i
think
i
got
what
i
paid
for
overall
over
the
past
year
i
have
become
accustomed
to
barleywines
and
the
many
different
breweries
that
produce
them
will
be
having
more
of
these
in
the
future

which
then

to
a

this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
tiny

for
a
smooth
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
with
a
very

of

good

i
love
o
maybe
its
all
the
trash
beers
ive
had
lately
but
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
this
is
a
surprisingly
strong
beer
and
has
a
nice
complexity
to
it
i
appreciate
it
from
harpoon
and
would
gladly
try
it
again
overall
a
very
enjoyable
barleywine
would
be
nice
if
this
was
available
in
ontario
because
i
am
sure
i
would
purchase
it
often
pours

thin
offwhite

quickly
recedes

the

brings

flavor
is
moderatelysweet
with
some

light
brown

plus
a
light
amount

dominates
though
its
not
too
integrated
alcohol
is
impressively
integrated
medium
body
and
average
carbonation
for
the
style
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
good
barleywine
though
i
feel
that
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
excessive
the
sugars
are
slightly
heavy
and
the
hops
overly
dominate
the
end
of
the
mouthful
the
beer
doesntat
least
for
mematch
up
to
the
excellent
levels
of
harpoons
other
leviathan
beers
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
still
a
good
beer
but
of
the
leviathan
beers
that
ive
tried
which
is
all
but
one
of
them
this
is
towards
the
bottom
of
the
rankings
o
damn
close
to
perfect
just
missing
a
few
things
in
my
opinion
that
would
kick
each
catagory
up
another
point
wish
it
was
just
a
bit
more
honeycaramelmaple
sticky
on
the
tongue
barrel
ageing
could
make
this
one
of
the
greatest
barleywines
ever
a
strong
flavorful
barleywines
that
lacks
some
of
the
smoothness
of
other
examples
decent
and
might
even
improve
with
some
age
sadly
the
alcohol
really
gets
strong
halfway
o
very
good
offering
by
harpoon
i
cant
wait
to
age
some
of
these
and
come
back
to
them
later
when
theyve
mellowed
out
d
easy
for
a
10
not
complex
pretty
well
put
together
overall
a
pretty
nice
barleywine
however
it
was
a
little
too
alcoholic
for
me
rather
intrusive
smell
the
aroma
was
loaded
down
with
caramel
lots
of
spices
in
the
nose
here
as
well
hints
of
raisins
and
figs
light
earthy
roasted
malts
and
a
good
touch
of
alcohol
very
complex
nose
and
unique
for
the
style
rich
tastes
of
oak
and
vanilla
hints
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
very
tight
and
nicely
done
a
bit
of
alcohol
just
enough
to
thicken
it
up
a
bit
a
really
nice
and
very
full
barley
wine
finish
was
strong
with
a
healthy
dose
of
d
spice
lingering
in
the
mouth
for
what
seemed
like
forever
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
thats
true
to
the
english
barleywine
style
really
one
of
the
best
styles
of
beer
on
the
planet
if
you
ask
me
top
notch
barleywines
are
is
all
about
balance
and
that
is
what
this
beer
delivers
not
sure
if
this
is
my
first
from
the
leviathan
series
but
this
is
the
first
one
i
can
recommend
yeah
im
a
huge
harpoon
homer
but
this
is
good
stuff
even
without
the
hometown
bias
o
nothing
off
i
just
kept
hoping
for
a
little
more
when
i
stopped
trying
and
just
enjoyed
this
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
definitely
recommended
d
pretty
drinkable
especially
considering
the
10
abv
the
hops
are
a
nice
surprise
the
overall
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
and
develop
nicely
especially
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
overall
a
sipper
but
and
enjoyable
one
the
hops
do
come
out
more
than
some
other
english
barleywines
that
i
have
had
one
of
the
better
leviathan
beers
i
have
had
yet
there
are
others
in
the
style
i
would
go
to
first
a
nice
offering
d
not
a
bad
bottle
of
beer
for
a
barleywine
i
expected
a
bit
more
flavor
actually
kind
of
weak
in
that
department
but
otherwise
a
solid
beer
ive
had
better
notes
good
if
unremarkable
offering
from
the
leviathan
series
sure
enough
these
are
relatively
heftier
brews
like
a
harpoon
rep
suggested
to
me
once
but
not
that
particularly
hefty
or
most
importantly
stimulating
luckily
most
of
them
remain
quality
the
100
barrel
series
are
typically
more
nuanced
by
design
again
the
rep
defended
but
i
think
id
rather
stick
to
those
instead
if
i
had
to
choose
notes
very
solid
has
everything
youre
looking
for
in
the
style
plus
a
little
extra
thanks
to
the
american
hops
drinks
great
fresh
but
im
still
curious
to
see
what
time
would
do
for
it
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
style
alcohol
doesnt
have
much
of
an
impact
another
solid
entry
in
the
leviathan
series
o
pretty
hot
with
the
alcohol
burning
i
think
this
one
might
improve
after
a
couple
years
in
the
cellar
ooverall
not
too
bad
definitely
need
to
take
your
time
this
one
the
10
abv
is
very
evident
od
its
satisfying
a
tad
sweet
not
the
easiest
to
drink
i
think
im
done
after
one
but
a
decent
barleywine
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
flavors
are
too
strong
and
the
abv
too
potent
the
brew
was
tasty
and
i
will
give
it
another
go
on
tap
d
i
partially
answered
this
already
however
this
is
more
of
a
oneanddone
deal
for
me
id
much
rather
seek
out
other
english
barleywines
than
this
however
i
wasnt
disappointed
with
this
either
the
abv
isnt
as
masked
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
correctionafter
checking
what
i
thought
might
be
saaz
was
probably
tettnang
hops
close
d
easy
to
drink
the
10
is
really
only
just
noticeable
drinks
like
an
8
aroma
and
flavor
are
a
bit
lacking
but
it
is
still
easy
to
drink
especially
for
the
abv
d
very
good
drinkability
alcohol
comes
through
but
doesnt
take
away
from
the
beer
youre
not
going
to
pound
through
these
but
you
can
easily
get
through
a
bottle
enjoying
it
the
entire
way
the
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
burnt
toffee
and
caramel
its
mildly
bitter
with
touch
of
alcohol
warmth
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
well
balanced
flavor
thats
bitter
up
front
with
an
excellent
malt
flavor
following
its
rich
and
flavorful
with
a
delicate
carameltoffee
feel
and
a
moderate
alcohol
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
brew
thats
true
to
style
and
easy
drinking
another
winner
from
the
leviathan
series
bitterness
steps
in
a
bit
on
the
taste
but
not
enough
to
offset
the
sweet
onslaught
of
maltiness
pretty
smooth
though
even
with
a
notable
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
despite
the
lack
of
hop
presence
i
think
this
one
would
get
better
with
age
and
some
oxidation
might
add
some
needed
complexity
to
the
malts
not
bad
worthy
of
a
fourpack
purchase
if
you
are
into
sweet
english
bwines
d
the
flavors
are
nice
but
the
alcohol
is
a
little
bit
too
unmasked
and
the
texture
is
a
little
too
syrupy
to
make
this
too
incredibly
drinkable
d
for
a
barleywine
this
is
very
drinkable
it
could
stand
up
to
some
cellaring
but
doesnt
need
it
dthis
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
english
barleywines
ive
ever
had
most
have
a
cloying
malt
sweetness
that
makes
drinking
more
than
one
a
chore
this
is
a
winner
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
brown
sugar
with
some
caramel
malt
and
piney
hops
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
sugar
as
well
as
some
pine
and
orange
notes
while
there
is
some
hop
flavor
there
is
very
little
bitterness
resulting
in
the
beer
being
very
sweet
the
alcohol
is
barely
detectable
very
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
overall
d
pretty
darn
good
for
the
style
deep
clear
brown
pour
with
good
head
decent
smell
mostly
hops
taste
is
also
hoppy
also
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
alcohol
coming
through
in
the
middle
of
the
swallow
nice
finish
but
overall
a
little
harsh
this
beer
is
one
that
requires
an
open
mind
to
enjoy

cant
say
i
was
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
however
cheers
pairs
well
with
spicy
foods
vindaloos
and
hearty
meaty
spicy
stews
of
the
western
variety
as
well
drinkability
a
good
barley
wine
maybe
it
should
be
aged
to
mellow
it
out
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
left
me
wanting
more
after
every
sip
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
has
great
complex
flavor
lots
to
taste
also
dangerously
easy
to
drink
peace
in
the
middle
east
not
really
too
keen
on
this
one
drink
is
meh
pretty
boozy
overall
drinks
hotter
than
10
it
seems
that
long
bitter
herbal
taste
at
the
end
doesnt
help
either
and
then
leaves
a
sticky
almost
icky
feel
in
the
mouth
not
especially
good
for
a
barley
wine
disappointment
overall
especially
in
relation
to
the
other
beers
in
the
leviathan
series
sip
after
sip
this
beer
grows
on
me
more
and
more
sure
you
could
probably
cellar
this
beer
but
it
is
drinking
great
now
di
can
see
why
others
say
to
age
this
beer
but
even
right
now
it
is
pretty
decent
flavors
are
balanced
nicely
and
the
alcohol
is
not
overwhelming
drinks
ok
alcohol
hidden
rather
well
for
being
10
suits
the
style
relatively
well
but
does
nothing
to
compare
itself
to
the
elite
falls
short
but
its
not
bad
this
is
quite
potent
brew
as
is
par
normal
with
the
leviathan
series
it
has
a
strong
malty
taste
that
rounds
off
quite
nice
on
the
tongue
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
leviathan
series
which
is
saying
something
considering
the
caliber
of
this
whole
line
it
does
have
a
very
strong
alcohol
flavor
to
it
that
i
have
not
noticed
quite
so
much
in
the
rest
of
the
series
but
they
still
round
this
one
out
for
an
all
around
good
beer
d
harpoons
leviathan
beers
are
usually
reliably
good
but
this
barleywine
is
definitely
not
up
to
snuff
this
tastes
almost
too
strong
to
be
an
english
barleywine
it
has
the
right
characteristics
for
the
americanized
style
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
enjoyable
to
drink
but
not
quite
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
barleywine
clear
coppery
chestnut
with
a
thin
skim
of
fine
beige
bubbles
and
a
modest
collar
sticky
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
overboard
with
ripe
fruits
banana
strawberries
alcohol
some
grain
and
caramel
in
the
background
it
sort
of
grew
on
my
but
was
odd
at
first
the
flavour
was
a
combination
of
burnt
sugary
sweetness
and
alcohol
banana
and
other
ripe
fruits
with
bitterness
more
apparent
in
the
finish
which
was
oddly
dry
and
quite
warm
moderate
carbonation
full
body
slightly
creamy
in
texture
decent
overall
but
the
fruity
character
was
a
little
too
much
for
my
liking
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
old
stock
snifter
pours
a
translucent
ambercaramel
with
a
loose
quarter
inch
tancolored
head
that
quickly
disperses
towards
the
edges
into
a
thin
bubbly
band
nose
expresses
candied
fruits
perhaps
figs
prunes
andor
raisins
and
a
light
ethanol
character
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
fruit
character
is
a
bit
more
subdued
than
anticipated
as
is
the
alcohol
theres
also
a
noticeable
hops
presence
closer
to
an
american
than
an
english
barleywine
in
my
opinion
and
perhaps
a
slightly
medicinal
quality
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
assertive
carbonation
and
some
residual
alcohol
heatastringency
detectable
towards
the
back
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
this
series
a
little
dull
for
the
style
it
might
improve
slightly
with
age
particularly
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
i
dont
see
this
as
becoming
overly
stellar
with
age
i
enjoyed
drinking
the
glass
in
front
of
me
this
is
another
good
addition
to
the
leviathan
series
but
probably
not
quite
on
par
with
triticus
lacks
the
complexity
need
to
bring
it
into
the
a
range
still
a
tasty
beer
though
and
worth
checking
out
if
you
see
it
around
drinkabiility
is
great
one
or
two
and
youre
done
as
its
a
powerful
10
but
thats
fine
as
youll
be
cherishing
this
barleywine
who
knew
as
a
great
sipping
beer
an
aggressive
bigfootlike
hop
burst
hits
the
palate
first
laying
down
bitter
layers
of
pine
sap
and
hop
oils
the
english
inspired
malt
bill
shows
up
nicely
with
a
toasted
toffee
and
nearmedicinal
grain
character
alcohol
is
present
and
breathy
in
the
finish
but
nowhere
near
hot
considering
the
greenness
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
spoton
in
terms
of
viscosity
and
carbonation
level
allowing
the
hops
to
linger
but
not
overwhelm
the
palate
overall
a
tasty
interpretation
of
the
style
and
a
fitting
contribution
to
the
leviathan
lineup
worth
seeking
out
as
this
barleywine
should
age
interestingly
i
liked
it
a
lot
better
from
the
growler
id
really
like
to
see
what
its
like
out
of
a
cask
maybe
that
would
mellow
it
out
a
lot
there
are
a
couple
of
leviathan
beers
from
harpoon
that
i
have
really
liked
but
there
have
also
been
some
pretty
bad
ones
this
is
closer
to
the
later
i
probably
will
not
revisit
this
one
d
this
was
a
rough
one
i
had
hoped
this
would
improve
as
it
warmed
up
but
it
had
the
opposite
affect
this
beer
should
be
drank
ice
cold
so
you
cant
taste
it
very
drinkable
which
is
scary
and
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
to
really
enjoy
this
is
what
saint
arnold
brewing
wants
the
dr10
to
taste
like
in
a
year
or
so
great
job
i
love
the
leviathan
series
of
beers
theyre
absolutely
amazing
in
the
series
this
one
has
to
be
my
second
favorite
next
to
the
imperial
ipa
i
would
love
to
see
harpoon
offer
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
and
i
bet
this
would
really
be
good
with
a
few
years
on
it
very
very
nice
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
will
cellar
a
bottle
or
two
just
to
see
what
happens
but
it
is
quite
nice
and
a
nice
deal
around
10
for
a
4
pack
the
nose
is
kind
of
a
mystery
to
me
but
the
taste
is
nice
still
saying
american
barleywine
though
12oz

a
nice
frothy
head
good
lacinng
im
picking
up
on
an
aroma
of
bubble
gum
also
some
sweetness
along
with
the
boozey
smell
this
beer
is
somewhat
watery
with
a
warming
alcohol
taste
only
hints
of
the
bubble
gum
in
the
flavor
but
it
does
have
an
overall
sweetness
to
it
decent
barleywine
worth
a
second
look
but
not
in
that
first
tier
of
the
great
ones
like
old
ruffian
taste
is
about
spot
on
with
the
nose
very
sweet
with
a
strong
brown
sugary
molasses
flavor
alcohol
on
the
finish
is
definitely
there
but
the
burn
is
not
too
bad
due
to
the
hops
and
the
sweet
making
it
pretty
smooth
makes
me
wonder
what
this
would
do
in
the
cellar
a
little
thin
for
my
tastes
as
the
barleywines
i
have
been
liking
lately
have
been
pretty
thick
but
overall
not
too
bad
an
attempt
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
considering
a
10
abv
triticus
is
my
personal
favorite
from
the
leviathan
series
but
this
is
a
close
